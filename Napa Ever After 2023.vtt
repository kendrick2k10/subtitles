00:00:58.367 --> 00:01:00.066
Cassie!

6
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.133
These people
are spending good money.

7
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:04.800
They don't want you sneakin'
and spyin' on their wedding.

8
00:01:04.934 --> 00:01:05.934
Sorry. Granny.

9
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.467
Come on.
I got a better idea.

10
00:01:25.734 --> 00:01:28.533
Got something for you.

11
00:01:28.667 --> 00:01:30.266
What is it?

12
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.133
Well. whenever
we bottle a new wine.

13
00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:33.800
we always sign
the first cork.

14
00:01:33.934 --> 00:01:36.967
And you get to do
the honors. Cassie.

15
00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:43.433
We built all of this. Cassie.

16
00:01:43.567 --> 00:01:45.600
All of it.

17
00:01:45.734 --> 00:01:47.533
And one of these days.
it's gonna be your mama's.

18
00:01:47.667 --> 00:01:49.266
And after that...

19
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.467
it's gonna be all yours.

20
00:01:53.233 --> 00:01:54.100
...kiss your bride.

21
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.700
We could all be here together.

22
00:02:13.834 --> 00:02:14.767
This is family.

23
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.467
Do you really need to go?

24
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.867
It's fine. Mom.
but we have to go.

25
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.867
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.867
I love you.

27
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.300

That sounds like a woman

39
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.633
on the verge
of spontaneous combustion.

40
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.500
Oh. this came certified
this morning--

41
00:03:17.633 --> 00:03:19.200
"Annie Fink.
Attorney-at-Law."

42
00:03:19.333 --> 00:03:20.533
Do we know an Annie Fink?

43
00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:21.633
Nope. No Annie Fink.

44
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.100
Tell me. Hank.

45
00:03:25.233 --> 00:03:27.233
Have we heard anything
on the Gervich case?

46
00:03:27.367 --> 00:03:29.000
Not a word.

47
00:03:29.133 --> 00:03:30.734
Don't go there!

48
00:03:30.867 --> 00:03:32.100
You presented
a compelling argument.

49
00:03:32.233 --> 00:03:33.533
Oh. yeah? Mm.

50
00:03:33.667 --> 00:03:35.333
Tell that to Joyce.

51
00:03:35.467 --> 00:03:36.533
Are you kidding?

52
00:03:36.667 --> 00:03:37.934
She terrifies me.

53
00:03:38.066 --> 00:03:39.967
Me too.

54
00:03:46.066 --> 00:03:48.266
Nuh-uh. girl!
That is not allowed.

55
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.600
No. I'll be fine
once I have my. um--

56
00:03:50.734 --> 00:03:52.066
oh. here we go!

57
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.900
Can I have a glass of Merlot

58
00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:55.166
and a Cabernet Sauvignon. please?

59
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.166
Mm-mm.

60
00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.667
What?

61
00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.600
My Grandma Emma always said

62
00:03:59.734 --> 00:04:02.066
that "red wine is the cure
for all that ails you..."

63
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.667
and I've got a lot of ailments.

64
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.133
You have been
a little more wired than usual.

65
00:04:06.266 --> 00:04:07.166
And that's saying a lot.

66
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.300
You know what?

67
00:04:08.433 --> 00:04:10.066
I have not heard a word
from Joyce about my case.

68
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.166
Complete radio silence.

69
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.333
She's gonna fire me.
Mm-hmm. That's what she does.

70
00:04:14.467 --> 00:04:15.734
She ghosts you.
then she ousts you.

71
00:04:15.867 --> 00:04:17.300
She sounds terrible. Cassandra.

72
00:04:17.433 --> 00:04:19.600
Oh. she is. but that's
what I love about her.

73
00:04:19.734 --> 00:04:20.934
You don't build
the most successful

74
00:04:21.066 --> 00:04:23.000
real estate law practice
in San Francisco

75
00:04:23.133 --> 00:04:24.967
by being a softie.

76
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.467
She wouldn't fire you
over one lost case--

77
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.500
which you haven't even lost!

78
00:04:28.633 --> 00:04:30.600
She might.
She might over a case this big.

79
00:04:30.734 --> 00:04:31.567
But you know what?

80
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.734
She might actually
be doing me a favor.

81
00:04:33.867 --> 00:04:35.667
You're a perfectionist.

82
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.100
Perfection is the enemy
of creativity. you know.

83
00:04:38.233 --> 00:04:39.233
Hmm!

84
00:04:39.367 --> 00:04:41.900
Is that from one of
your little self-help books?

85
00:04:42.033 --> 00:04:43.967
Yes. it is. but it's true!

86
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.467
Why don't you take a break?

87
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.333
Let someone else
pick up the load.

88
00:04:47.467 --> 00:04:50.233
Oh. How is your little
handsome fiancé?

89
00:04:50.367 --> 00:04:51.734
Is she changing the subject?

90
00:04:51.867 --> 00:04:52.600
Mm-hmm.

91
00:04:52.734 --> 00:04:53.800
I cannot wait

92
00:04:53.934 --> 00:04:55.900
for the two of you
to get married

93
00:04:56.033 --> 00:04:57.500
and make me an auntie.

94
00:04:57.633 --> 00:04:59.233
And who's gonna make me
an auntie?

95
00:04:59.367 --> 00:05:00.166
Not you two!

96
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.567
Before anybody
becomes an auntie.

97
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.734
we need to plan
a girls' trip.

98
00:05:04.867 --> 00:05:06.333
Cassandra.

99
00:05:06.467 --> 00:05:08.166
You've been promising
to take us to Napa Valley.

100
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.567
Let's do that.

101
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.166
I haven't been there
since I was a kid.

102
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.667
Look. maybe next year.

103
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.367
That's what you said
two years ago.

104
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.533
Look. there is
a very complicated

105
00:05:16.667 --> 00:05:18.000
family situation going on.

106
00:05:18.133 --> 00:05:19.633
Girl. please.

107
00:05:19.767 --> 00:05:21.133
Answer that phone.

108
00:05:21.266 --> 00:05:23.533
Cassandra Moore speaking.

109
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.700
Oh.

110
00:05:29.033 --> 00:05:30.700
Okay. Well...

111
00:05:31.934 --> 00:05:33.333
...thanks for letting me know.

112
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.900
Well. I guess I'm going
back to Napa Valley

113
00:05:38.033 --> 00:05:40.367
sooner than expected.

114
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.600
My grandma Emma
just passed away.

115
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.533
No...

116
00:05:44.667 --> 00:05:46.200
Oh. honey.

117
00:05:50.333 --> 00:05:53.200
How long will you be gone for?

118
00:05:53.333 --> 00:05:54.467
Well. the funeral's
on Saturday.

119
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.133
Maybe a couple days. tops.

120
00:05:56.266 --> 00:05:58.400
Look. I know the circumstances
aren't great.

121
00:05:58.533 --> 00:06:00.600
but maybe the break
might be good for you.

122
00:06:00.734 --> 00:06:03.133
I'm not so sure about that.

123
00:06:03.266 --> 00:06:04.967
Look. I'm gonna go there.
pay my respects.

124
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.100
and get back to work
as soon as possible.

125
00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:09.533
If I have a job
to come back to.

126
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.867
Cassandra. could you
please come to my office?

127
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.934
Okay.

128
00:06:21.033 --> 00:06:23.300
Joyce wants to see me.

129
00:06:37.333 --> 00:06:38.734
So. Cassandra.

130
00:06:38.867 --> 00:06:40.700
You've put in
a lot of hours here.

131
00:06:40.834 --> 00:06:43.133
Giving it your all.
burning the midnight oil.

132
00:06:43.266 --> 00:06:45.567
and I want to thank you
for your service to this firm.

133
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.300
Thank you
for saying that. Joyce.

134
00:06:48.433 --> 00:06:50.266
My work here
means the world to me.

135
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.433
and you have been
such an amazing mentor.

136
00:06:56.233 --> 00:06:57.734
Just know
that I appreciate

137
00:06:57.867 --> 00:07:00.333
every opportunity
you've given me and...

138
00:07:01.567 --> 00:07:04.867
...respect whatever decision
you need to make at this time.

139
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.834
Okay.

140
00:07:06.967 --> 00:07:08.834
Even if that means
letting me go.

141
00:07:08.967 --> 00:07:11.200
Why on Earth would I do that?

142
00:07:11.333 --> 00:07:13.767
Cassandra. Judge McKenna
ruled in our favor.

143
00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.967
The client is very pleased.
and so am I.

144
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.700
Don't I look excited?

145
00:07:17.834 --> 00:07:18.867
Oh.

146
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.200
Very excited.

147
00:07:21.333 --> 00:07:22.467
This was excellent work.

148
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.500
and Frank Wheeler
wants you on his account

149
00:07:24.633 --> 00:07:26.133
for all his properties--

150
00:07:26.266 --> 00:07:27.367
worldwide.

151
00:07:29.066 --> 00:07:31.600
Congratulations. Cassandra.
You just made partner.

152
00:07:34.066 --> 00:07:35.100
Seriously?

153
00:07:35.233 --> 00:07:36.533
- Ohh!
- Finding someone

154
00:07:36.667 --> 00:07:38.767
with your instincts
and work ethic is rare.

155
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.934
However. you thought
this was a big win?

156
00:07:41.066 --> 00:07:43.300
That's nothing compared to what
we're going to do together.

157
00:07:43.433 --> 00:07:45.266
And I'm gonna need
all you've got.

158
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.266
You have got it!

159
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.667
Good.

160
00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.333
Game on.
Starting now.

161
00:07:53.066 --> 00:07:54.433
Oh. about that.

162
00:07:54.567 --> 00:07:57.600
Um. I have to go out of town
this weekend.

163
00:07:57.734 --> 00:07:59.266
My grandmother passed away.

164
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.467
Oh. I'm sorry.

165
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.400
No. no. no. But I'll be
right back. and then...

166
00:08:03.533 --> 00:08:04.667
game on!

167
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.567
Take all the time

168
00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:06.900
- you need. Cassandra.
- No. no. no.

169
00:08:07.033 --> 00:08:08.033
I'm good.

170
00:08:08.166 --> 00:08:09.967
After a couple days.
I'll be back.

171
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.867
Hold on. Miss Fink.

172
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.233
You want me to stay
in Napa Valley for six months?

173
00:08:15.367 --> 00:08:16.867
Well. you'll need
at least that long

174
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.734
to figure out
which staff members

175
00:08:18.867 --> 00:08:20.734
you want to keep.
who you want to hire.

176
00:08:20.867 --> 00:08:22.600
What are you talking about?

177
00:08:22.734 --> 00:08:25.100
Didn't you get the certified
documents I sent over?

178
00:08:31.133 --> 00:08:33.000
Your grandmother left you
the vineyard.

179
00:08:33.133 --> 00:08:34.934
Congratulations. Cassandra.

180
00:08:35.066 --> 00:08:37.233
You are the new owner
of Eloi.

181
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.433
Oh. my gosh.

182
00:08:45.467 --> 00:08:46.367
Wow.

183
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.567
Wow!

184
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.200
How do you feel about this?

185
00:08:52.333 --> 00:08:55.500
Oh. I think the real question
is how do you feel about it?

186
00:08:55.633 --> 00:08:56.467
I know you and Grandmother

187
00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.200
weren't exactly
on the best of terms.

188
00:08:58.333 --> 00:09:01.900
Oh. she thought I stole her
daughter away from her. and you.

189
00:09:02.033 --> 00:09:03.133
I know. Dad.

190
00:09:03.266 --> 00:09:05.333
She wanted Mom
to take over the vineyard.

191
00:09:05.467 --> 00:09:06.567
That was her wish...

192
00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:07.967
not your mother's.

193
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.300
She couldn't accept that.

194
00:09:09.433 --> 00:09:10.900
Tore the family apart.

195
00:09:11.033 --> 00:09:12.800
Well. I kind of wish
I had spent more time with her.

196
00:09:14.633 --> 00:09:16.834
Why? So she could
make you feel bad

197
00:09:16.967 --> 00:09:18.633
about choosing to be a lawyer
like your old man

198
00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:21.333
instead of stomping grapes
with your feet?

199
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.233
You know. Dad. I don't think
they do that anymore.

200
00:09:26.367 --> 00:09:28.000
Get all the details
while you're there

201
00:09:28.133 --> 00:09:29.500
and let me know how I can
help you with the sale.

202
00:09:29.633 --> 00:09:31.467
The sale?

203
00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.767
You're gonna sell it.
aren't you?

204
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.433
You don't have time
to run a vineyard.

205
00:09:34.567 --> 00:09:37.300
You've just made partner.

206
00:09:37.433 --> 00:09:40.467
Of course I'm going to sell it.

207
00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.066
What other choice
do I have. right?

208
00:09:51.367 --> 00:09:53.500
Hi. I have an appointment

209
00:09:53.633 --> 00:09:55.433
with one of your real estate
agents-- Eric.

210
00:09:55.567 --> 00:09:57.834
Yes. Well. it was supposed
to start 15 minutes ago.

211
00:09:57.967 --> 00:10:00.100
but. of course. I got stuck
in bridge traffic.

212
00:10:00.233 --> 00:10:03.333
But no worries. I will be
at your office in 10 minutes.

213
00:10:03.467 --> 00:10:05.500
He has another
appointment in 30 minutes.

214
00:10:05.633 --> 00:10:07.066
so we may need
to reschedule you

215
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.667
to later today.

216
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.400
I promise
I'll be there in 10.

217
00:10:10.533 --> 00:10:12.233
Less than 10.

218
00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.900
Or maybe not.

219
00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:18.767
I'll call you right back.

220
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.500
All right. all right.

221
00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:51.333
Let's see here...

222
00:11:01.333 --> 00:11:02.734
You doing okay there?

223
00:11:02.867 --> 00:11:04.000
Doin' great.

224
00:11:04.133 --> 00:11:05.734
You need a hand?

225
00:11:05.867 --> 00:11:09.533
I don't. actually.
but thank you for offering.

226
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.533
Seems like you know
your way around a flat tire.

227
00:11:13.667 --> 00:11:15.567
My father insisted I learn.

228
00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.000
or else I could be stuck
out in the middle of nowhere.

229
00:11:18.133 --> 00:11:19.967
at the mercy
of a complete stranger.

230
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.567
Oh. So. a damsel in distress
she is not.

231
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.834
Nor will she ever be.

232
00:11:25.967 --> 00:11:28.567
So. what. you're just gonna
stand there and watch me?

233
00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.066
If you don't mind.

234
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.967
Oh. I get it.

235
00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:34.800
So you're trying to make sure
I don't mess up. right?

236
00:11:34.934 --> 00:11:37.633
So you can just swoop on in
and save me?

237
00:11:37.767 --> 00:11:39.033
No. not at all.

238
00:11:39.166 --> 00:11:40.567
No. I'm thinking
there may be

239
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.467
a few things
that you can tell me.

240
00:11:44.033 --> 00:11:45.500
Such as?

241
00:11:45.633 --> 00:11:47.166
We could start with your name.

242
00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.333
Look.
I'm not trying to be rude.

243
00:11:49.467 --> 00:11:51.300
but I really don't
have time for this.

244
00:11:51.433 --> 00:11:53.800
I'm only in town
for one. maybe two days.

245
00:11:53.934 --> 00:11:55.667
Easy now!

246
00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.200
This isn't a marriage proposal.

247
00:11:57.333 --> 00:11:59.233
I am just being neighborly.
as they say.

248
00:11:59.367 --> 00:12:02.133
But it seems like
you can hold your own.

249
00:12:02.266 --> 00:12:04.066
Good luck with the tire.

250
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.433
Thank you. Good luck with...

251
00:12:05.567 --> 00:12:08.133

Oh!

262
00:13:00.166 --> 00:13:01.367
I am so sorry.

263
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.700
I wasn't expecting
anyone to be here.

264
00:13:03.834 --> 00:13:05.200
Neither was I.

265
00:13:05.333 --> 00:13:08.533
since most people knock
and use the front door.

266
00:13:08.667 --> 00:13:10.367
Cassandra. I presume?

267
00:13:11.633 --> 00:13:13.333
Please forgive me...

268
00:13:13.467 --> 00:13:15.000
but am I supposed to know you?

269
00:13:15.133 --> 00:13:17.166
I'm Isabel Collins.

270
00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.133
I'm your grandmother's
best friend.

271
00:13:19.266 --> 00:13:20.166
It's good to see you.

272
00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.867
This place must have

273
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.633
changed quite a bit
since you were here last. huh?

274
00:13:23.767 --> 00:13:25.667
I would say so.

275
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.600
Well. come on.

276
00:13:28.734 --> 00:13:31.266
Let's. uh. look around
and refresh that memory.

277
00:13:35.433 --> 00:13:36.934
Now. we have to prune these.

278
00:13:37.066 --> 00:13:39.800
and we're planting new vines
right over here.

279
00:13:43.834 --> 00:13:45.433
When did you move here?

280
00:13:45.567 --> 00:13:47.967
Oh. a few years
after my husband died.

281
00:13:49.166 --> 00:13:51.467
Neither one of us
wanted to go it alone.

282
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.300
We had
some great times together.

283
00:13:53.433 --> 00:13:55.033
I did. too.

284
00:13:56.467 --> 00:13:58.500
I used to love watching weddings
from the balcony.

285
00:13:58.633 --> 00:14:00.700
This place was so beautiful.

286
00:14:00.834 --> 00:14:02.934
Well. I heard the stories

287
00:14:03.066 --> 00:14:05.667
about your grandma
and your mama.

288
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.600
Now. your grandma
was one stubborn lady.

289
00:14:07.734 --> 00:14:09.433
- Eh.
- I guess your mama was too.

290
00:14:09.567 --> 00:14:10.967
Mm.

291
00:14:12.233 --> 00:14:13.834
I suppose
it runs in the family.

292
00:14:13.967 --> 00:14:15.767
I suppose it does.

293
00:14:17.567 --> 00:14:19.233
Far as I could tell.

294
00:14:19.367 --> 00:14:21.767
they were both standing up
for what they both believed in.

295
00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:22.734
Mm-hmm.

296
00:14:22.867 --> 00:14:24.266
Not sure either one of them
was wrong.

297
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.500
Oh. all I know is.
Mom wanted to be an artist.

298
00:14:26.633 --> 00:14:29.100
to start a new life with my dad.

299
00:14:29.233 --> 00:14:32.367
And Emma wanted this place
to stay in the family.

300
00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:33.934
- Mm.
- The last thing she wanted

301
00:14:34.066 --> 00:14:38.066
was for Eloi to be
in the hands of strangers.

302
00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.834
It's kind of cold out here.

303
00:14:39.967 --> 00:14:41.400
Let's go in for some tea.

304
00:14:41.533 --> 00:14:43.000
Sure.

305
00:14:43.133 --> 00:14:44.300
Okay. Let's go.

306
00:14:45.667 --> 00:14:46.567
Camomile tea.

307
00:14:47.633 --> 00:14:48.967
Calms the senses.

308
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.700
How many employees do you have?

309
00:14:54.834 --> 00:14:58.266
Well. we have a small crew
that keeps up the bottling.

310
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.333
We haven't been
doing much growing lately.

311
00:15:00.467 --> 00:15:01.767
but that's okay.

312
00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.300
since we have
some nice old vintages

313
00:15:03.433 --> 00:15:05.266
that are aging
in our barrels.

314
00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.000
Not as fancy as our 2014 Cab.
but you do what you can.

315
00:15:09.633 --> 00:15:10.667
This is Mom's.

316
00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:11.533
Yes.

317
00:15:11.667 --> 00:15:13.233
Every time
we bottled a new wine.

318
00:15:13.367 --> 00:15:15.066
Oh. my goodness.

319
00:15:16.433 --> 00:15:18.333
I can't believe
it's still here.

320
00:15:18.467 --> 00:15:19.600
Grandma had me sign this

321
00:15:19.734 --> 00:15:21.000
the same day that we...

322
00:15:22.633 --> 00:15:24.000
...the same day
we left for good.

323
00:15:24.133 --> 00:15:25.800
Gosh.

324
00:15:25.934 --> 00:15:27.633
Now this...

325
00:15:27.767 --> 00:15:30.467
this is what you call
an accomplishment...

326
00:15:32.233 --> 00:15:34.133
...to build something
that you love

327
00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:35.900
with your bare hands.

328
00:15:36.033 --> 00:15:38.834
It makes me wonder why Mom
wanted to leave this place.

329
00:15:40.734 --> 00:15:43.100
Sometimes. we all need
a little break

330
00:15:43.233 --> 00:15:45.734
so we can return
renewed and refreshed.

331
00:15:45.867 --> 00:15:47.834
That's what your grandmother
was hoping your mom would do

332
00:15:47.967 --> 00:15:49.300
when she left.

333
00:15:49.433 --> 00:15:50.867
But it wasn't just a break.

334
00:15:51.967 --> 00:15:53.633
No.

335
00:15:56.266 --> 00:15:58.967

00:16:52.633 --> 00:16:55.333
It was
a really beautiful service.

348
00:16:55.467 --> 00:16:57.567
And different.
just like Grandma.

349
00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:58.834
Oh. yeah.

350
00:16:58.967 --> 00:17:02.266
Um. I'll be in touch.

351
00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.266
I'm sure the guy
that's handling the sale

352
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.100
will need
to speak with you.

353
00:17:07.367 --> 00:17:09.333
I wanted to give you this.

354
00:17:11.066 --> 00:17:12.300
What is it?

355
00:17:12.433 --> 00:17:15.133
Your grandma was big
about writing letters.

356
00:17:16.367 --> 00:17:19.433
Maybe it was easier for her
to say what she needed to say

357
00:17:19.567 --> 00:17:21.133
this way.

358
00:17:23.333 --> 00:17:24.467
Wow.

359
00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:25.667
Here's the rest of them.

360
00:17:27.033 --> 00:17:29.000
All of these?

361
00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:33.066
I'm gonna miss
this old place.

362
00:17:38.033 --> 00:17:39.100
Oh!

363
00:17:39.233 --> 00:17:42.166
Oh. Isabel.

364
00:18:12.667 --> 00:18:14.100
My dearest Cassandra--

365
00:18:14.233 --> 00:18:15.333
I am so happy

366
00:18:15.467 --> 00:18:17.600
that your mother and I
began writing to each other

367
00:18:17.734 --> 00:18:18.834
before she died.

368
00:18:18.967 --> 00:18:21.100
We dreamed of having a reunion

369
00:18:21.233 --> 00:18:22.700
here at Eloi
when she got better.

370
00:18:22.834 --> 00:18:25.767
We dreamed that. some day.
you would join us.

371
00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.033
If there is a little piece
of your heart

372
00:18:28.166 --> 00:18:30.266
that still loves this place.

373
00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:34.533
please. do what you can
to nurture and protect Eloi.

374
00:18:34.667 --> 00:18:36.500
Love.
Grandma Emma.

375
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.867
on the notes you made. ned f

376
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.500
- so we're good to go.
- That's great.

377
00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.567
Joyce...

378
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.533
I need to take a sabbatical.

379
00:18:51.033 --> 00:18:52.600
This better be good.

380
00:18:53.867 --> 00:18:55.200
Am I really doing this?

381
00:18:55.333 --> 00:18:56.600
Yep. and I'm glad you are.
You need the break.

382
00:18:56.734 --> 00:18:58.367
What break?

383
00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.300
I have to learn how to run
a winery in six months.

384
00:19:01.433 --> 00:19:03.667
What does your dad think
about all of this?

385
00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.467
Ah. well. as far as he knows.
I'm selling.

386
00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.333
and I'm not telling him otherwise.

387
00:19:08.467 --> 00:19:10.500
Oh. girl! Good luck with that.

388
00:19:10.633 --> 00:19:11.633
Mm-hmm.

389
00:19:12.934 --> 00:19:14.433
Cheers!

390
00:19:14.567 --> 00:19:17.500
Cassandra.
you know how to drink wine.

391
00:19:17.633 --> 00:19:19.800
You don't know the first thing
about making wine.

392
00:19:19.934 --> 00:19:21.000
No. but other people do.

393
00:19:21.133 --> 00:19:22.400
and I'll just hire them
to teach me.

394
00:19:22.533 --> 00:19:25.900
I am very capable. Hank.

395
00:19:26.033 --> 00:19:27.734
And this vineyard--
is it making money.

396
00:19:27.867 --> 00:19:29.500
or do you have to bankroll it?

397
00:19:29.633 --> 00:19:32.233
I will have to make
a small investment...

398
00:19:32.367 --> 00:19:35.100
but it's just until
things get moving again.

399
00:19:37.533 --> 00:19:39.233
Can I ask you something?

400
00:19:39.367 --> 00:19:41.133
Why are you doing this?

401
00:19:42.767 --> 00:19:44.600
I'm doing it for my mom.

402
00:19:44.734 --> 00:19:47.000
She always wanted to.
but never got the chance.

403
00:19:51.133 --> 00:19:52.100
At least tell me

404
00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:55.333
that I'm gonna be getting
free wine out of this.

405
00:19:55.467 --> 00:19:58.266
You will get free wine
by the cases.

406
00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:02.333
Oh!

407
00:20:11.033 --> 00:20:13.433
♪ You gonna know my name ♪

408
00:20:13.567 --> 00:20:15.800
♪ Because Ima get you ♪

409
00:20:15.934 --> 00:20:18.066
♪ You gonna know my name ♪

410
00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.300
♪ 'Cause Ima get you ♪

411
00:20:20.433 --> 00:20:22.734
♪ Ima get you
Ima get you. yeah ♪

412
00:20:22.867 --> 00:20:24.800
You know. I'd ask you
if you need any help.

413
00:20:24.934 --> 00:20:26.266
but we both know
how that will go.

414
00:20:27.633 --> 00:20:29.567
We were never
properly introduced.

415
00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.433
mostly because you refused.

416
00:20:31.567 --> 00:20:32.834
but I think now's
as good a time as any.

417
00:20:32.967 --> 00:20:34.333
Alec Jackson.

418
00:20:34.467 --> 00:20:35.667
Cassandra Moore.

419
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.600
I own this place now.

420
00:20:39.734 --> 00:20:40.900
Yeah. so I've heard.

421
00:20:41.033 --> 00:20:42.333
Napa is vast in acreage.

422
00:20:42.467 --> 00:20:44.967
but it is small
when it comes to town gossip.

423
00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:46.433
You getting settled in
all right?

424
00:20:46.567 --> 00:20:47.667
Is there anything I can--

425
00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.166
I don't mean to be rude. but...
what are you doing here?

426
00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.767
Oh. I worked
for your grandmother for years.

427
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.333
Now I just help oversee

428
00:20:54.467 --> 00:20:55.834
- the work crew.
- Cassandra!

429
00:20:55.967 --> 00:20:57.166
Oh!

430
00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.266
Tino told me
you were coming back.

431
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.667
Oh. Isabel.

432
00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:01.867
It's wonderful
to have you here.

433
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.333
Oh. so good to see you.

434
00:21:03.467 --> 00:21:06.700
Yeah. I figured I'd come back
and give it a go.

435
00:21:06.834 --> 00:21:08.967
Well. you're talking
to the right man

436
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.333
who can help you with that.

437
00:21:10.467 --> 00:21:12.567
We need all hands on deck.

438
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.633
Isabel. we need
to slow things down. okay?

439
00:21:14.767 --> 00:21:16.800
Look. I don't even know what
I can afford to pay people yet.

440
00:21:16.934 --> 00:21:18.233
Just let me get to the bank.

441
00:21:18.367 --> 00:21:20.033
That way. I can see
where the property stands.

442
00:21:20.166 --> 00:21:22.333
I can go over the budget
with a fine-tooth comb.

443
00:21:22.467 --> 00:21:24.333
and I can look at
the outstanding bills

444
00:21:24.467 --> 00:21:25.400
and see if
I can even get a loan.

445
00:21:25.533 --> 00:21:27.300
Just like Emma.

446
00:21:27.433 --> 00:21:28.533
Okay.

447
00:21:28.667 --> 00:21:30.834
Well. I insist
on staying pro bono.

448
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.333
I can't allow that.

449
00:21:33.467 --> 00:21:34.734
Why is that?

450
00:21:34.867 --> 00:21:37.700
Because maybe
I don't want to owe anyone.

451
00:21:37.834 --> 00:21:39.300
Oh. Well.
I don't call in favors.

452
00:21:39.433 --> 00:21:41.400
Never have. never will.

453
00:21:41.533 --> 00:21:43.367
He's telling the truth.

454
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.567
Practically ran the place
when Emma got sick.

455
00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:47.567
Never asked for one red cent.

456
00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.900
Okay. Well.
just because he's free

457
00:21:50.033 --> 00:21:52.500
doesn't mean
he's the right man for the job.

458
00:21:52.633 --> 00:21:54.033
I don't even know
your skill set.

459
00:21:54.166 --> 00:21:56.133
Well. my skill set's
as follows--

460
00:21:56.266 --> 00:21:59.567
I know this place
like the back of my hand.

461
00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.033
and you don't.

462
00:22:01.166 --> 00:22:02.633
But you will...

463
00:22:02.767 --> 00:22:04.133
with my help.

464
00:22:04.266 --> 00:22:06.100
See? Everything's
gonna work out just fine.

465
00:22:06.233 --> 00:22:07.934
Why don't we go in
and have some tea.

466
00:22:08.066 --> 00:22:09.967
and we can start
making plans?

467
00:22:21.934 --> 00:22:24.100
Whoa! Are you okay?

468
00:22:24.233 --> 00:22:26.367
I'm good. I'm good.
I'm great.

469
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:27.867
Oof.

470
00:22:31.433 --> 00:22:32.700
I'm good.

471
00:22:32.834 --> 00:22:34.433
- Are you good?
- Yeah. I'm good.

472
00:22:34.567 --> 00:22:37.633
Your grandma was
a pillar of the community.

473
00:22:37.767 --> 00:22:38.934
That's true.

474
00:22:39.066 --> 00:22:40.567
Everyone loved Emma Eloi.

475
00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:42.600
Mm. I didn't know her
very well.

476
00:22:42.734 --> 00:22:45.734
but I'm happy
she had that kind of support.

477
00:22:45.867 --> 00:22:47.233
You know. we were dry here
for a spell.

478
00:22:47.367 --> 00:22:48.266
but Alec here.

479
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.467
he got us to a place

480
00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.033
where we could start
making wine again.

481
00:22:51.166 --> 00:22:52.867
Really?

482
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.066
And how exactly
did you do that. Alec?

483
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.734
Well... I did an assessment.

484
00:22:57.867 --> 00:22:58.967
The root system
needed supplements.

485
00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.533
so I checked the water lines.
soil minerals. et cetera.

486
00:23:01.667 --> 00:23:02.600
Now. best-case scenario.

487
00:23:02.734 --> 00:23:05.100
you'll be able to prune
and train the vines.

488
00:23:05.233 --> 00:23:07.533
and have bud breaks
in a month or so.

489
00:23:07.667 --> 00:23:09.700
but you won't be able
to bear any fruit--

490
00:23:09.834 --> 00:23:11.600
not for a few months.

491
00:23:11.734 --> 00:23:12.700
That's perfect.

492
00:23:12.834 --> 00:23:14.433
I'm on a six-month sabbatical.
so--

493
00:23:14.567 --> 00:23:16.333
Six months?

494
00:23:16.467 --> 00:23:17.834
You think you can do
all of this in six months?

495
00:23:19.133 --> 00:23:20.633
Well. you just said--

496
00:23:20.767 --> 00:23:22.934
I said.
"best-case scenario".

497
00:23:23.066 --> 00:23:25.433
Now. things don't always
go according to plan out here.

498
00:23:25.567 --> 00:23:27.967
Now. six months--
that's just the beginning.

499
00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.700
This is an ongoing enterprise.

500
00:23:29.834 --> 00:23:31.100
You just can't just start it.

501
00:23:31.233 --> 00:23:33.000
and leave it
to take care of itself.

502
00:23:33.133 --> 00:23:34.300
I'm fully aware of that.

503
00:23:37.233 --> 00:23:38.700
Sorry. Got to get this.

504
00:23:38.834 --> 00:23:41.367
She gets upset
when I don't take her calls.

505
00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.300
Hey. love!

506
00:23:43.433 --> 00:23:45.834
Yeah. no. I told you
that I'm at work.

507
00:23:45.967 --> 00:23:47.333
Mm-hmm.

508
00:23:47.467 --> 00:23:49.333
I know. I'll--
I'll make it up to you.

509
00:23:49.467 --> 00:23:50.633
Yeah.

510
00:23:50.767 --> 00:23:53.100
Yeah. in about
another hour or so.

511
00:23:53.233 --> 00:23:55.000
Okay. Don't be mad.

512
00:23:55.133 --> 00:23:57.834
Love you. Bye.

513
00:23:57.967 --> 00:23:59.767
Feel free to go if you need.

514
00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:01.834
I. um. don't want anyone
getting upset with you.

515
00:24:01.967 --> 00:24:02.834
No. it's fine.

516
00:24:02.967 --> 00:24:04.900
I will bring her
something nice for dinner.

517
00:24:05.033 --> 00:24:07.000
She'll get over it.
She always does.

518
00:24:07.133 --> 00:24:08.767
Wow. What a charmer.

519
00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.433
So they say.

520
00:24:13.633 --> 00:24:15.600
Anyway. where were we again?

521
00:24:15.734 --> 00:24:18.400
Um. right--
things going according to plan.

522
00:24:18.533 --> 00:24:20.567
And you telling me
there's no such thing.

523
00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.700
Well. you know.
there is one thing

524
00:24:22.834 --> 00:24:24.767
that you can count on
out here.

525
00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.667
Sunrise--

526
00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.200
crisp chill in the air.

527
00:24:28.333 --> 00:24:29.767
sweet sounds
across the valley.

528
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.533
It's magical.

529
00:24:32.667 --> 00:24:35.533
You get that every day.
whether you plan on it or not.

530
00:24:37.633 --> 00:24:39.934
Ladies.

531
00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.667
What the--

532
00:25:04.734 --> 00:25:07.200
This is a beautiful morning?

533
00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:14.066
I don't know.
Maybe it's just a leaky pipe.

534
00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.433
Well. I'll call Alec

535
00:25:15.567 --> 00:25:16.600
and have him come
and take a look.

536
00:25:16.734 --> 00:25:18.133
Oh.

537
00:25:18.266 --> 00:25:20.667
Okay. Isabel. are you sure
that he's qualified?

538
00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.066
I'm sure that he is
a great vineyard worker.

539
00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.667
but maybe. just maybe.
we should get a plumber?

540
00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:30.133
Dear. there is nothing
that Alec can't do.

541
00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:33.667
All right. Have him come
while I'm at the bank.

542
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.266
And tell him

543
00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.967
I insist on paying him.

544
00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:38.467
All right. I'll tell him.

545
00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.667
but I already know
what he's gonna say.

546
00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:44.600
"Super Alec"-- again.

547
00:26:05.533 --> 00:26:09.233
We all loved your grandmother.
and her wine.

548
00:26:09.367 --> 00:26:11.233
Eloi's 2014 Cabernet

549
00:26:11.367 --> 00:26:12.900
is one of the best
I've ever had.

550
00:26:13.033 --> 00:26:14.367
But...

551
00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:15.800
...I'm afraid to tell you

552
00:26:15.934 --> 00:26:17.667
your inheritance

553
00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.700
isn't the jackpot
you might think it is.

554
00:26:19.834 --> 00:26:21.633
So the business
was struggling?

555
00:26:21.767 --> 00:26:23.834
So I'm just gonna pick up
where she left off--

556
00:26:23.967 --> 00:26:27.033
start making some minor repairs.
and build back slowly.

557
00:26:27.166 --> 00:26:30.500
Then I'm thinking about $50.000
for the exterior.

558
00:26:30.633 --> 00:26:32.033
for the vines.
the bottling.

559
00:26:32.166 --> 00:26:34.000
then. before you know it.

560
00:26:34.133 --> 00:26:36.200
we will be turning a profit
and taking care of the house.

561
00:26:36.333 --> 00:26:37.333
I'm sorry.

562
00:26:37.467 --> 00:26:39.000
I don't think you're
understanding. Miss Moore--

563
00:26:39.133 --> 00:26:41.867
there is no equity
to take out on that property.

564
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.700
I don't think I understand.

565
00:26:43.834 --> 00:26:46.500
Emma Eloi mortgaged
that property to the hilt.

566
00:26:46.633 --> 00:26:49.066
She didn't want anyone to know.

567
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.400
but any time
she needed more money.

568
00:26:51.533 --> 00:26:54.700
she'd be right back
in that chair you're sitting in.

569
00:26:55.867 --> 00:26:56.834
Wait.

570
00:26:56.967 --> 00:27:01.300
Are you saying that Eloi
is completely underwater?

571
00:27:01.433 --> 00:27:03.600
With interest rates
where they are these days.

572
00:27:03.734 --> 00:27:05.800
property values
are sinking fast.

573
00:27:05.934 --> 00:27:08.433
However...

574
00:27:08.567 --> 00:27:10.734
if you have another home you'd
like to use as collateral--

575
00:27:10.867 --> 00:27:12.800
The only property I own
is Eloi.

576
00:27:12.934 --> 00:27:14.500
Then I'm sorry.
there's nothing we can do.

577
00:27:17.834 --> 00:27:18.734
Unless...

578
00:27:18.867 --> 00:27:20.433
you want to sell.

579
00:27:22.333 --> 00:27:25.834
I can introduce you
to a few very motivated buyers.

580
00:27:28.934 --> 00:27:31.166
I don't walk away
from challenges.

581
00:27:42.433 --> 00:27:43.800
Hey!

582
00:27:43.934 --> 00:27:44.967
Hey.

583
00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:46.367
So how'd it go with the bank?

584
00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:47.767
Mm.

585
00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:49.834
You know. wait there.
I'm coming up.

586
00:27:49.967 --> 00:27:51.834
No. no. no. You don't have--

587
00:27:51.967 --> 00:27:53.867
Okay. I'll just wait here.

588
00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.967
Oh.

589
00:28:05.166 --> 00:28:07.767
What a spectacular view.

590
00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:10.700
Mm. I remember when
Grandmother used to take me here

591
00:28:10.834 --> 00:28:11.934
to watch the weddings.

592
00:28:14.033 --> 00:28:16.066
I thought this was the most
magical place in the world.

593
00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.333
Hmm.

594
00:28:17.467 --> 00:28:20.266
Hmm. Not like anyone would
want to get married there now.

595
00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.433
You know.
an "Emma Eloi wedding"

596
00:28:22.567 --> 00:28:24.233
was every young girl's dream.

597
00:28:24.367 --> 00:28:25.734
Did you know

598
00:28:25.867 --> 00:28:27.600
Grandmother mortgaged this place
to keep it afloat?

599
00:28:27.734 --> 00:28:30.066
I didn't.

600
00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:33.767
But then.
she was a very proud woman.

601
00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.000
Even if
there was something wrong.

602
00:28:35.133 --> 00:28:36.033
she'd never let on.

603
00:28:36.166 --> 00:28:37.533
Why?

604
00:28:37.667 --> 00:28:39.700
What was your connection to her?

605
00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.367
She meant a lot to me.

606
00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:46.433
She helped me out at a time
where I really needed her.

607
00:28:48.467 --> 00:28:52.166
You know. this vineyard.
it was her lifeblood.

608
00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:53.600
and it meant everything

609
00:28:53.734 --> 00:28:56.433
that she was able to leave
her mark in this valley.

610
00:28:56.567 --> 00:28:59.500
Everyone says
she was such a special woman.

611
00:28:59.633 --> 00:29:02.166
That's why I wish
I'd known her better.

612
00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.600
Why didn't you?

613
00:29:07.266 --> 00:29:09.300
Good old family drama.

614
00:29:09.433 --> 00:29:11.300
See. that's why
I'm so surprised

615
00:29:11.433 --> 00:29:12.900
she left the vineyard to me.

616
00:29:13.033 --> 00:29:15.000
You know.

617
00:29:15.133 --> 00:29:17.433
kind of makes sense.

618
00:29:17.567 --> 00:29:19.600
It's her way of...

619
00:29:19.734 --> 00:29:21.500
you know.
closing the distance.

620
00:29:21.633 --> 00:29:23.800
bringing the family back
to. you know.

621
00:29:23.934 --> 00:29:24.967
where it all started.

622
00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.233
Mm.

623
00:29:27.233 --> 00:29:28.967
Oh.

624
00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.433
Excuse me.

625
00:29:30.567 --> 00:29:32.834
Hey!

626
00:29:32.967 --> 00:29:35.433
Yeah. okay.
I will be right there.

627
00:29:35.567 --> 00:29:36.800
Love you. too.

628
00:29:38.066 --> 00:29:39.934
All right.
Well. I've gotta go.

629
00:29:40.066 --> 00:29:40.867
The pipe is fixed. though.

630
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.734
so it should not
leak on your face again.

631
00:29:42.867 --> 00:29:43.800
- Thanks.
- Okay.

632
00:29:43.934 --> 00:29:45.600
How much do I owe you?

633
00:29:45.734 --> 00:29:47.300
Nah.
This one's on the house.

634
00:29:47.433 --> 00:29:49.266
You're not trying to take pity
on me. are you?

635
00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.166
No. I wouldn't dream of it.

636
00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:54.467
We all know that you don't
need anyone's help. right?

637
00:30:05.133 --> 00:30:07.266
Tell me again
who the "Valcolts" are.

638
00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.734
Local vintners.

639
00:30:08.867 --> 00:30:10.433
They adored your grandma.

640
00:30:10.567 --> 00:30:12.000
You'll love them!

641
00:30:12.133 --> 00:30:13.567
Why are we going to see them?

642
00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:14.600
Well...

643
00:30:14.734 --> 00:30:16.667
I figured it would be a...

644
00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:18.834
a good way for you
to get to know your grandma.

645
00:30:18.967 --> 00:30:21.133
You're standing on the shoulders
of greatness. girl.

646
00:30:21.266 --> 00:30:22.166
Come on!

647
00:30:26.467 --> 00:30:27.967
I like to think

648
00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:30.300
we make a pretty good Chardonnay
at Valcolt.

649
00:30:30.433 --> 00:30:32.066
My dad's been doing this
for a long time.

650
00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.166
It's very nice.

651
00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.166
Rich... buttery.

652
00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:36.433
With an oak-influenced style.

653
00:30:36.567 --> 00:30:37.667
That's our signature.

654
00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.400
It's not an Eloi.
but then. what is?

655
00:30:40.533 --> 00:30:41.800
Nothing.
But I may be biased.

656
00:30:43.533 --> 00:30:44.767
Your grandmother--

657
00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:47.000
she took my dad under her wing
when he was first starting out.

658
00:30:47.133 --> 00:30:49.000
She did that
for a lot of people.

659
00:30:49.133 --> 00:30:50.934
We liked to call her
"the Godmother of the Valley".

660
00:30:51.066 --> 00:30:53.734
Excuse me. miss?

661
00:30:53.867 --> 00:30:58.333
And if someone hit hard times
and needed a job.

662
00:30:58.467 --> 00:31:00.533
even if she didn't
have an opening.

663
00:31:00.667 --> 00:31:01.934
Emma would
find them something.

664
00:31:05.467 --> 00:31:06.667
Um. Isabel...

665
00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:07.533
Mm?

666
00:31:07.667 --> 00:31:08.867
Did you know about
all the loans

667
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.400
that Grandmother took out
on the vineyard?

668
00:31:10.533 --> 00:31:13.066
Emma didn't want to burden
anyone with her troubles.

669
00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.166
I mean. I'd ask.
and her signature answer was.

670
00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:17.400
"It's fine.

671
00:31:17.533 --> 00:31:19.667
I'm fine.
Everything's fine."

672
00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:22.300
So. why did she stop
with the weddings?

673
00:31:22.433 --> 00:31:25.734
Well. Emma was "Eloi Weddings".

674
00:31:25.867 --> 00:31:28.400
But as she got older.
there was just too much work.

675
00:31:28.533 --> 00:31:33.166
Plus. the wedding area
overhead was very expensive.

676
00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.400
and with our small staff.

677
00:31:35.533 --> 00:31:36.900
something had to give.

678
00:31:37.033 --> 00:31:38.233
and eventually...

679
00:31:38.367 --> 00:31:42.066
everything had to give.
except the bottling.

680
00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:45.700
Would be nice to have
the weddings back. though.

681
00:31:46.967 --> 00:31:48.700
Wait a second--
is that who

682
00:31:48.834 --> 00:31:50.500
he's been speaking with
on the phone?

683
00:31:50.633 --> 00:31:54.133
Yep. That's the only girl
that can capture his heart.

684
00:31:54.266 --> 00:31:56.533
Wait. you thought--

685
00:31:56.667 --> 00:31:58.400
I didn't think anything.

686
00:31:59.433 --> 00:32:01.233
I didn't!

687
00:32:01.367 --> 00:32:03.633
Well. he's single.
in case you were wondering.

688
00:32:03.767 --> 00:32:05.200
I wasn't. but thank you.

689
00:32:05.333 --> 00:32:06.633
Oh!

690
00:32:08.166 --> 00:32:09.133
Thank you.

691
00:32:09.266 --> 00:32:10.233
Ahem.

692
00:32:10.367 --> 00:32:11.934
Dad. look.

693
00:32:12.066 --> 00:32:13.467
Oh! Well...

694
00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.967
hello.

695
00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:16.400
Hi.

696
00:32:16.533 --> 00:32:19.133
Cassandra.
this is my daughter. Mary.

697
00:32:19.266 --> 00:32:21.600
Mary. this is Miss Cassandra.

698
00:32:21.734 --> 00:32:22.934
Pleasure to meet you. Mary.

699
00:32:23.066 --> 00:32:25.900
You too.
Hi. Mrs. Isabel.

700
00:32:26.033 --> 00:32:26.767
Hello. sweetheart.

701
00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:28.633
We just came over
to ask your dad

702
00:32:28.767 --> 00:32:31.400
when he's gonna be
coming over tomorrow.

703
00:32:31.533 --> 00:32:33.100
Isabel. I'm sure that Alec
has other things to do

704
00:32:33.233 --> 00:32:35.533
besides hang around
the vineyard all day.

705
00:32:35.667 --> 00:32:37.266
What do you do. anyway?

706
00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.900
I design software and apps.

707
00:32:39.033 --> 00:32:40.734
Set my own schedule.

708
00:32:40.867 --> 00:32:43.133
And he makes a very good living
at it. too. right. Alec?

709
00:32:43.266 --> 00:32:46.200
Well. to answer
your first question.

710
00:32:46.333 --> 00:32:47.533
"Miss Isabel".

711
00:32:47.667 --> 00:32:48.934
I will be coming
bright and early

712
00:32:49.066 --> 00:32:50.367
to check out
the irrigation system.

713
00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:51.533
see if there's anything
that. you know.

714
00:32:51.667 --> 00:32:54.200
needs replacing before
we start pruning the vines.

715
00:32:54.333 --> 00:32:55.800
Alec. you know.
if you just tell me

716
00:32:55.934 --> 00:32:57.967
what needs to be done
and give me a quick tutorial.

717
00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:00.767
I can take over
and run the staff myself.

718
00:33:02.734 --> 00:33:03.667
Okay. wait a second.

719
00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.934
Why do the two of you
continue to laugh at me?

720
00:33:06.066 --> 00:33:07.800
This isn't a joke.

721
00:33:07.934 --> 00:33:09.200
Maybe you're funny

722
00:33:09.333 --> 00:33:10.300
and. you know.
you just don't know it.

723
00:33:10.433 --> 00:33:12.767
Oh. Maybe you just don't
want to give up the reins

724
00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:14.834
because it makes you feel good
about yourself. hmm?

725
00:33:14.967 --> 00:33:17.300
You like feeling
like a hero. Alec?

726
00:33:17.433 --> 00:33:18.934
You know. what if I was
to say to you.

727
00:33:19.066 --> 00:33:21.867
"Why don't you just give me
a quick tutorial on the law

728
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.100
and I'll." you know. "defend
those criminals myself"?

729
00:33:24.233 --> 00:33:25.133
I don't defend criminals.

730
00:33:25.266 --> 00:33:26.433
I'm a real estate lawyer.

731
00:33:26.567 --> 00:33:27.667
Bah.

732
00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.667
Six of one.
half a dozen of another.

733
00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.367
Maybe you underestimate me.

734
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:32.934
Maybe you overestimate yourself.

735
00:33:33.066 --> 00:33:34.100
Maybe I'm a quick study.

736
00:33:34.233 --> 00:33:36.433
Well. I'm a good teacher.

737
00:33:36.567 --> 00:33:39.433
So if the lady insists on
overseeing things for herself.

738
00:33:39.567 --> 00:33:41.200
far be it for me
to stop her.

739
00:33:41.333 --> 00:33:42.800
I will be there tomorrow morning

740
00:33:42.934 --> 00:33:44.967
to show you
how everything works.

741
00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:46.700
and then you can take over.

742
00:33:46.834 --> 00:33:48.400
Thank you.

743
00:33:49.834 --> 00:33:51.033
You're welcome.

744
00:33:52.633 --> 00:33:53.967
You ready. Mare-Mare?

745
00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:55.700
- Yep.
- All right.

746
00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.300
Bah!

747
00:33:58.433 --> 00:34:00.166
See you bright and early.

748
00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:01.533
Can't wait.

749
00:34:01.667 --> 00:34:03.433
- Mm-hmm.
- Nice to meet you. Mary.

750
00:34:03.567 --> 00:34:05.500
You too.

751
00:34:05.633 --> 00:34:07.600
Let's go. Come on.

752
00:34:17.834 --> 00:34:18.734
Knock-knock.

753
00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:21.133
- Mary!
- Grandma!

754
00:34:21.266 --> 00:34:23.934
Hey. Mom.
Thanks for taking Mary today.

755
00:34:24.066 --> 00:34:25.467
I just got
an early thing at Eloi.

756
00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.233
Ooh! With
Miss Emma's granddaughter?

757
00:34:28.367 --> 00:34:30.700
Her name is Miss Cassandra.

758
00:34:30.834 --> 00:34:31.900
"Miss Cassandra"?

759
00:34:32.033 --> 00:34:33.533
Ooh! Is she pretty?

760
00:34:33.667 --> 00:34:34.934
Very pretty.

761
00:34:35.066 --> 00:34:35.867
Mom.

762
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.433
What?
I thought you were done at Eloi.

763
00:34:38.567 --> 00:34:40.033
Is that why
you're hanging around so much?

764
00:34:40.166 --> 00:34:42.533
I am just helping Cassandra--

765
00:34:42.667 --> 00:34:44.100
Miss Emma's granddaughter--

766
00:34:44.233 --> 00:34:45.734
she's. uh.
you know. a little green.

767
00:34:45.867 --> 00:34:46.767
Well. what's she like?

768
00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:48.633
Is she smart?
Is she like her grandmother?

769
00:34:48.767 --> 00:34:50.767
Oh. my gosh.
When do I get to meet her?

770
00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:52.533
Mom. please.
Slow your roll. okay?

771
00:34:52.667 --> 00:34:53.533
She only here for six months.

772
00:34:53.667 --> 00:34:55.233
and then she goes back
to being a lawyer.

773
00:34:55.367 --> 00:34:58.000
Well. you know. son.
a lot can happen in six months.

774
00:35:01.767 --> 00:35:03.567
You be good. Mare.

775
00:35:04.667 --> 00:35:07.033
You too. Mom.

776
00:35:07.166 --> 00:35:08.834
See you later.

777
00:35:11.667 --> 00:35:12.934
Cassandra?

778
00:35:13.066 --> 00:35:14.133
Hey!

779
00:35:14.266 --> 00:35:16.266
Are you ready to do this?

780
00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.867
Oh. I am always ready.

781
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.233
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

782
00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:24.500
You. uh. you want to bring
that book with you.

783
00:35:24.633 --> 00:35:26.867
or leave it
under the tarp?

784
00:35:30.433 --> 00:35:31.967
So right now. these are dormant.

785
00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:33.667
which happens in the winter.

786
00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:35.300
but it's the ideal time
to prune.

787
00:35:35.433 --> 00:35:36.867
get them ready for spring--

788
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.600
you know. when
they start producing fruit.

789
00:35:38.734 --> 00:35:41.367
Oh. so we do this on every row?

790
00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:43.300
Mm-hmm.

791
00:35:43.433 --> 00:35:45.533
See. Emma's got
a machine pruner in the shed.

792
00:35:45.667 --> 00:35:47.200
but you're still gonna need
four or five more guys

793
00:35:47.333 --> 00:35:49.633
if you want to get
this ready in time.

794
00:35:49.767 --> 00:35:52.467
You know. the rest of your crew.
they're too busy bottling.

795
00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:53.934
Four or five guys?

796
00:35:54.066 --> 00:35:55.433
Yeah. You know. there are
some high-school kids

797
00:35:55.567 --> 00:35:57.200
who know the drill.

798
00:35:57.333 --> 00:35:59.000
You can hire them
for fairly cheap.

799
00:35:59.133 --> 00:36:01.033
but you're still gonna need

800
00:36:01.166 --> 00:36:02.834
a professional
to run the machinery.

801
00:36:02.967 --> 00:36:04.066
Okay.

802
00:36:05.734 --> 00:36:06.834
Ah.

803
00:36:06.967 --> 00:36:09.200
And I'm assuming
that professional is you?

804
00:36:09.333 --> 00:36:11.667
Oh. You flatter me.

805
00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:14.100
I mean. I'm not
a true professional.

806
00:36:14.233 --> 00:36:16.033
but I do know my way
around a pruner.

807
00:36:17.533 --> 00:36:19.734
Anyways.
we get enough rain up here.

808
00:36:19.867 --> 00:36:21.734
so you're not gonna need
to water too often.

809
00:36:21.867 --> 00:36:23.900
I'd say once every 10 days
should do it.

810
00:36:24.033 --> 00:36:25.033
All right.

811
00:36:25.166 --> 00:36:26.333
Now. you don't want
to over-saturate

812
00:36:26.467 --> 00:36:27.533
and waterlog the roots.

813
00:36:27.667 --> 00:36:28.433
Now. if those leaves
turn yellow.

814
00:36:28.567 --> 00:36:29.433
that is a bad sign.

815
00:36:29.567 --> 00:36:31.000
Okay.

816
00:36:31.133 --> 00:36:33.033
You...

817
00:36:33.166 --> 00:36:34.233
want to write
all this down?

818
00:36:34.367 --> 00:36:35.734
No. I don't.

819
00:36:35.867 --> 00:36:37.934
You didn't think
there was that much to it?

820
00:36:38.066 --> 00:36:41.000
I mean. my book
wasn't entirely thorough.

821
00:36:41.133 --> 00:36:43.367
but. you know. I did make it
through law school on my own.

822
00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:44.467
paid back my student loans.

823
00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.934
made partner at my firm
before the age of 40.

824
00:36:47.066 --> 00:36:48.233
Tch! I got this.

825
00:36:48.367 --> 00:36:49.600
Sure you do.

826
00:36:49.734 --> 00:36:51.200
Mm-hmm.

827
00:36:51.333 --> 00:36:52.767
Let me show you
how to tend the soil.

828
00:37:02.066 --> 00:37:04.066
Come on. stay in there.

829
00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.100
Oh. I'm coming.

830
00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:13.333
How did it go out there?

831
00:37:13.467 --> 00:37:14.767
Oh. you know.

832
00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:16.800
Passed out
two. maybe three times--

833
00:37:16.934 --> 00:37:19.266
...so I'd say that was a win.

834
00:37:21.367 --> 00:37:23.233
Have some lemonade. dear.

835
00:37:23.367 --> 00:37:25.166
Thank you. Isabel.

836
00:37:29.734 --> 00:37:31.834
It's a lot. I know...

837
00:37:31.967 --> 00:37:34.967
but I told you.
Alec is the man for the job.

838
00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:38.100
What is his story. Isabel?

839
00:37:38.233 --> 00:37:40.500
He likes to think
that he's got me pegged.

840
00:37:40.633 --> 00:37:43.734
but he's not very forthcoming
about himself.

841
00:37:43.867 --> 00:37:45.233
Well. his wife. Shelly.
passed away

842
00:37:45.367 --> 00:37:47.567
about a year
after your grandfather.

843
00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.133
He took care of Shelly
for two years

844
00:37:49.266 --> 00:37:50.767
while she was sick.

845
00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:53.100
and they had a four-year-old
little girl at home.

846
00:37:53.233 --> 00:37:55.567
He was so lost.

847
00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:58.166
Emma had just gone through
the same thing.

848
00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:01.467
and she just took his hand.
picked him up.

849
00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.834
and got the community
to rally around him and Mary.

850
00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:06.800
Ohh.

851
00:38:06.934 --> 00:38:10.400
Hence the reason he still
wants to take care of Eloi.

852
00:38:10.533 --> 00:38:11.867
I guess Emma Eloi

853
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.033
will always have a special place
in his heart.

854
00:38:15.166 --> 00:38:18.633
and you. my dear.
will reap the benefits.

855
00:38:18.767 --> 00:38:20.533
and the sooner
you accept that.

856
00:38:20.667 --> 00:38:23.133
the better off we'll all be.

857
00:38:33.166 --> 00:38:34.066
Surprise!

858
00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:35.667
Wine weekend!

859
00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:37.000
What are you two doing here?

860
00:38:37.133 --> 00:38:38.300
Did you not hear me
the first time?

861
00:38:38.433 --> 00:38:40.133
"Wine weekend!"

862
00:38:40.266 --> 00:38:41.967
No. I know--

863
00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:43.166
...I know that part!

864
00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.567
I just wasn't expecting you.

865
00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:46.800
This place
isn't quite ready for visitors.

866
00:38:46.934 --> 00:38:48.567
We're not "visitors".

867
00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:50.066
Besides. we don't judge.

868
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.967
Well. we might judge a little...

869
00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:54.333
but we love you.

870
00:38:54.467 --> 00:38:55.967
I love you. too!

871
00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:57.533
I just wish you would've called
and told me before you came.

872
00:38:57.667 --> 00:38:59.367
It was sort of an emergency.

873
00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:00.467
I have to change
my wedding date.

874
00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:01.433
What?

875
00:39:01.567 --> 00:39:02.633
Why? When?

876
00:39:02.767 --> 00:39:03.600
Dan is joining

877
00:39:03.734 --> 00:39:05.433
this "Doctors Give Back"
program abroad.

878
00:39:05.567 --> 00:39:06.667
Oh. Lena...

879
00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:09.066
So you need to come back home
and help me plan. Please?

880
00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:10.934
No. Lena.
I can't leave right now.

881
00:39:11.066 --> 00:39:12.266
But you're one
of my bridesmaids!

882
00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.900
I know that.
but I can't--

883
00:39:14.033 --> 00:39:17.233
Oh. hold that thought!
Let's discuss this over brunch.

884
00:39:17.367 --> 00:39:18.367
- Mm.
- And wine.

885
00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:19.467
Mm!

886
00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.433
Okay. Well. before that.
let me. uh.

887
00:39:21.567 --> 00:39:23.567
show you around my vineyard. dahling.

888
00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:24.967
Oh.

889
00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:27.467
Oh. yeah. okay.
Maybe I should change first.

890
00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:30.100
Okay. All right.
I'll be right back.

891
00:39:32.266 --> 00:39:33.600
"My vineyard"?

892
00:39:33.734 --> 00:39:35.934
Seriously.

893
00:39:45.767 --> 00:39:47.900
Well! Now I see why
you don't want to leave.

894
00:39:48.033 --> 00:39:49.133
Who is this?

895
00:39:49.266 --> 00:39:50.467
That's Alec.

896
00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:52.567
Apparently. he was really close
friends with my grandmother.

897
00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:54.200
and he's been helping out
for years.

898
00:39:54.333 --> 00:39:56.734
He's also known
as "the uncatchable catch".

899
00:39:56.867 --> 00:39:58.066
We'll see about that.

900
00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.967
Hi! Hello! I'm Lena--

901
00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:01.400
"Dr. Carey."
as some would call me.

902
00:40:01.533 --> 00:40:02.734
We're Cassandra's friends.

903
00:40:02.867 --> 00:40:03.800
Just came up for the weekend.

904
00:40:03.934 --> 00:40:05.033
I'm Angela.

905
00:40:05.166 --> 00:40:06.867
Oh. Alec.

906
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:07.867
Nice to meet you both.

907
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.400
Mm!

908
00:40:09.533 --> 00:40:11.467
So how are you ladies
at pruning?

909
00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.033
Unless you're talking
about eyebrows.

910
00:40:13.166 --> 00:40:14.233
the answer is "terrible".

911
00:40:15.533 --> 00:40:17.867
Alec. they totally
surprised me.

912
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.166
So. my girls--

913
00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:21.934
got a few things to wrap up.
but I'll meet up with you later.

914
00:40:22.066 --> 00:40:23.600
Nah. No. it's cool.

915
00:40:23.734 --> 00:40:24.767
I brought reinforcements.

916
00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:26.533
You ladies. go have fun.

917
00:40:26.667 --> 00:40:27.900
We'll tend to the vines.

918
00:40:28.033 --> 00:40:29.934
The man said he's good!

919
00:40:30.066 --> 00:40:31.300
Let's go.
Wine awaits.

920
00:40:31.433 --> 00:40:33.066
Mm-hmm!

921
00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:34.233
That is am--

922
00:40:34.367 --> 00:40:35.533
Do you think about
anything other than...

923
00:40:35.667 --> 00:40:38.400
You say all of that?
Spill.

924
00:40:38.533 --> 00:40:41.066
We need the tea on this guy
and do not leave anything out.

925
00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.633
The tea is hot!

926
00:40:45.567 --> 00:40:47.500
♪ No. we don't need
to think about it ♪

927
00:40:51.033 --> 00:40:52.867

935
00:41:17.967 --> 00:41:21.000
Those boys who were working
on the vines just drove off.

936
00:41:21.133 --> 00:41:22.934
They were here for hours!

937
00:41:23.066 --> 00:41:28.033
Mm-hmm. And all I could hear
was "cha-ching. cha-ching."

938
00:41:28.166 --> 00:41:30.300
You ladies know
I had to dip into my savings?

939
00:41:30.433 --> 00:41:32.500
Which was pretty meager
to begin with.

940
00:41:32.633 --> 00:41:34.200
after paying my student loans.

941
00:41:34.333 --> 00:41:36.533
The wine doesn't make
enough money for the upkeep?

942
00:41:36.667 --> 00:41:38.333
Oh. honey. not when
every penny goes towards

943
00:41:38.467 --> 00:41:40.300
paying the multiple
home-equity loans

944
00:41:40.433 --> 00:41:42.100
my grandmother took out.

945
00:41:42.233 --> 00:41:44.767
I have no idea
what I'm doing here anymore.

946
00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:46.300
You're learning.

947
00:41:46.433 --> 00:41:48.767
And it seems your teacher--

948
00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:50.800
...is a charmin'. handsome...

949
00:41:50.934 --> 00:41:53.033
♪ ...young man named Alec! ♪

950
00:41:53.166 --> 00:41:54.367
Would you stop it?

951
00:41:55.967 --> 00:41:58.433
I have got more important things
to deal with--

952
00:41:58.567 --> 00:42:00.767
like how am I going
to pay those kids?

953
00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:03.166
This place used to be thriving.

954
00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:04.834
and I refuse to be the one
to run it into the ground.

955
00:42:04.967 --> 00:42:07.266
Mm. All good things
take time. sis.

956
00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:09.367
Time that I don't have. Angela.

957
00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:10.900
Then you'll have
to get creative.

958
00:42:11.033 --> 00:42:13.500
You know. when my grandma
needed some extra cash.

959
00:42:13.633 --> 00:42:16.033
she used to sell barbeque
sandwiches to the neighbors.

960
00:42:16.166 --> 00:42:18.600
It was like a party
in our backyard every weekend.

961
00:42:18.734 --> 00:42:20.934
Mm. Did she just say
"barbeque sandwiches"?

962
00:42:21.066 --> 00:42:22.200
Oh!

963
00:42:22.333 --> 00:42:23.934
The shade is real
from this one.

964
00:42:24.066 --> 00:42:25.667
- From the broke one!
- Uh-huh.

965
00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.500
- Eh. good point.
- Uh-huh!

966
00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.834
Okay. okay!

967
00:42:31.967 --> 00:42:34.400
Well. to your point. Angela--

968
00:42:34.533 --> 00:42:36.233
the weddings here
were beautiful.

969
00:42:36.367 --> 00:42:37.900
and maybe it was
a little similar

970
00:42:38.033 --> 00:42:39.734
to those barbeque sandwiches.

971
00:42:43.333 --> 00:42:44.734
Look at this.

972
00:42:48.133 --> 00:42:49.333
Right?

973
00:42:49.467 --> 00:42:53.066
Isn't it amazing?

974
00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:55.767
Grandma used to allow us
to go on the balcony--

975
00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:58.934
Um... is this
your handyman Alec?

976
00:42:59.066 --> 00:43:00.600
It is.

977
00:43:00.734 --> 00:43:03.066
Honey. I'm sorry. he's--

978
00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.133
A widower.

979
00:43:05.266 --> 00:43:07.133
I knew about his wife.

980
00:43:07.266 --> 00:43:08.633
and I've met his daughter.

981
00:43:08.767 --> 00:43:12.100
but I had no idea
he got married at Eloi.

982
00:43:12.233 --> 00:43:14.867
What a perfect setting
for a wedding.

983
00:43:16.734 --> 00:43:20.467
I just had...
the most amazing idea!

984
00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:22.433
Now. if I can pull this off.

985
00:43:22.567 --> 00:43:23.834
you. my dear.

986
00:43:23.967 --> 00:43:25.433
are going to have
the wedding of your dreams.

987
00:43:25.567 --> 00:43:29.000
and we are gonna bring back
the glory days of Eloi!

988
00:43:29.133 --> 00:43:30.667
Is she thinking
what I think she's thinkin'?

989
00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.066
I don't know.
but if there's wine involved.

990
00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:33.300
I'm here for it.

991
00:43:33.433 --> 00:43:35.433
Oh. yes.

992
00:43:35.567 --> 00:43:36.734
Yeah. you know.

993
00:43:36.867 --> 00:43:38.233
it's a great idea. Cassandra.

994
00:43:38.367 --> 00:43:40.300
but it's gonna take a lot more
than one deposit

995
00:43:40.433 --> 00:43:42.400
to get this place
in shape for a wedding.

996
00:43:42.533 --> 00:43:44.633
You're right.
One deposit won't be enough.

997
00:43:44.767 --> 00:43:45.600
Well. exactly.
because. you know--

998
00:43:45.734 --> 00:43:46.834
- But...
- ...We got stuff we got to do.

999
00:43:46.967 --> 00:43:49.667
...What if we got word out
that Eloi weddings are back?

1000
00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.767
Lena's wedding could be
the first of many to come.

1001
00:43:53.133 --> 00:43:54.100
Okay.

1002
00:43:54.233 --> 00:43:55.667
Okay. listen.
So here's what we'll do. right?

1003
00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:58.333
We'll set up a website
to take in deposits.

1004
00:43:58.467 --> 00:44:00.834
People book these events
a year in advance. anyway--

1005
00:44:00.967 --> 00:44:02.734
well. with the exception
of Lena--

1006
00:44:02.867 --> 00:44:06.533
but those deposits
could pay for everything.

1007
00:44:06.667 --> 00:44:08.367
I don't know.
You know. it's. uh...

1008
00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:09.734
it's risky.

1009
00:44:09.867 --> 00:44:11.667
Slightly.

1010
00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:13.166
And we'd have to let
everybody know

1011
00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:14.367
that we are still
under construction.

1012
00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:16.333
Full transparency. Agreed.

1013
00:44:16.467 --> 00:44:19.033
Huh. You know. what if
we don't make a deadline?

1014
00:44:19.166 --> 00:44:21.367
I mean. you do not want
to mess with people's weddings.

1015
00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:23.200
I always make my deadlines.

1016
00:44:23.333 --> 00:44:24.867
- Huh.
- Look. Alec.

1017
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.700
I know
this is a huge undertaking--

1018
00:44:26.834 --> 00:44:28.367
wine and now weddings--

1019
00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:31.166
but I can't do this
without you.

1020
00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:32.533
I need your help.

1021
00:44:36.433 --> 00:44:38.934
I'm sorry. Could you--
Could you say that again?

1022
00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:42.567
I need your help.

1023
00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:44.200
Ooh!

1024
00:44:44.333 --> 00:44:45.200
Heh. heh.

1025
00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:48.233
Wow. How did that feel
for you. huh?

1026
00:44:48.367 --> 00:44:50.667
Because. mm.
that was good for me.

1027
00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:52.467
You are such a mess.

1028
00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:53.900
All right. listen.
You ain't gotta beg. Cassandra.

1029
00:44:54.033 --> 00:44:56.567
I'll be more than happy
to help you.

1030
00:44:57.834 --> 00:44:59.734
Thank you.

1031
00:45:06.934 --> 00:45:09.200
Well. hello there.

1032
00:45:09.333 --> 00:45:10.433
Dad?

1033
00:45:15.633 --> 00:45:17.333
Mr. Moore. let me tell you--
and then she said.

1034
00:45:17.467 --> 00:45:18.533
"You should have
your wedding here."

1035
00:45:18.667 --> 00:45:20.100
and I was like. "Oh. that's
a great idea. Cassandra!"

1036
00:45:20.233 --> 00:45:22.600
And the wine here--
have you tasted the wine?

1037
00:45:22.734 --> 00:45:24.133
It is the best!

1038
00:45:24.266 --> 00:45:25.467
I mean. ha!

1039
00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:27.300
It is so good--
and I should know.

1040
00:45:27.433 --> 00:45:28.633
I'm practically
a wine sommelier.

1041
00:45:28.767 --> 00:45:29.633
It's the terroir--

1042
00:45:29.767 --> 00:45:30.767
The amount of wine
that we've had here--

1043
00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:31.667
- ...with the Earth--
- ...since we've been here--

1044
00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:33.333
Oh. my gosh!
You would think that--

1045
00:45:33.467 --> 00:45:35.433
But this whole place has got--

1046
00:45:35.567 --> 00:45:36.700
The variety of wine
that she's able to grow--

1047
00:45:36.834 --> 00:45:37.767
so many varieties...

1048
00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:39.500
Ladies... Ladies!

1049
00:45:39.633 --> 00:45:41.367
Oh. that was amazing.

1050
00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:42.367
Yeah? Yeah.

1051
00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:43.400
Uh. Dad?

1052
00:45:43.533 --> 00:45:45.266
Um. I think it's time
for a walk and talk.

1053
00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.200
Yes. I'd like that.

1054
00:45:47.333 --> 00:45:48.433
Okay.

1055
00:45:48.567 --> 00:45:50.834
And maybe you can tell me
exactly what's going on here.

1056
00:45:50.967 --> 00:45:52.700
Sure.

1057
00:45:52.834 --> 00:45:53.867
- Okay. Bye. Mr. Moore!
- Mr. Moore!

1058
00:45:58.300 --> 00:45:59.600
So...

1059
00:45:59.734 --> 00:46:02.233
when were you gonna tell me

1060
00:46:02.367 --> 00:46:04.934
about changing your mind
about selling?

1061
00:46:05.066 --> 00:46:07.033
I wanted to make
some headway first.

1062
00:46:07.166 --> 00:46:09.166
Show you I'd made
some progress.

1063
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:10.500
Progress?

1064
00:46:10.633 --> 00:46:11.667
Doing what?

1065
00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:13.433
Jeopardizing your career?

1066
00:46:13.567 --> 00:46:15.767
Honey. you just got
a promotion--

1067
00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:17.934
the promotion you've been
working towards for months.

1068
00:46:18.066 --> 00:46:19.433
Daddy. I already I know that.

1069
00:46:19.567 --> 00:46:21.433
You're set up
for a great future.

1070
00:46:21.567 --> 00:46:23.433
and now you want
to risk that for...

1071
00:46:23.567 --> 00:46:24.934
this?

1072
00:46:25.066 --> 00:46:27.967
Mom...
is the reason I'm doing this.

1073
00:46:29.467 --> 00:46:31.200
Come on.

1074
00:46:31.333 --> 00:46:33.767
I need to show you something.

1075
00:46:45.533 --> 00:46:48.066
Why didn't you tell me
about this before?

1076
00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:50.233
Because I didn't want you
to feel bad.

1077
00:46:50.367 --> 00:46:51.200
Why would I feel bad?

1078
00:46:51.333 --> 00:46:53.200
Well. because
I didn't want you to feel

1079
00:46:53.333 --> 00:46:54.233
like any of this
was your fault.

1080
00:46:54.367 --> 00:46:56.433
Cassandra. I assure you.

1081
00:46:56.567 --> 00:46:58.166
your mother's decisions
were hers.

1082
00:46:58.300 --> 00:46:59.233
not mine.

1083
00:46:59.367 --> 00:47:01.066
Your grandmother had no right
to make her feel

1084
00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:03.133
that she was wrong
for following her heart.

1085
00:47:03.266 --> 00:47:04.834
I already know that. Dad.

1086
00:47:04.967 --> 00:47:05.867
And now you've found
a bunch of letters

1087
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.266
and you feel the need
to right some wrong?

1088
00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.967
Honey. this isn't your fight.

1089
00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:12.600
Well. then.
whose fight is it. Dad?

1090
00:47:15.433 --> 00:47:18.333
I can see you have your heart
set on doing this.

1091
00:47:18.467 --> 00:47:20.734
I do.

1092
00:47:20.867 --> 00:47:22.967
And I would love
to have your support.

1093
00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:27.734
I...

1094
00:47:27.867 --> 00:47:30.066
I hope you get what
you're looking for out of this.

1095
00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:32.066
I really do.

1096
00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:48.567
I miss you guys already!

1097
00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:50.233
This was so fun.

1098
00:47:50.367 --> 00:47:52.300
Thank you so much
for coming to see me.

1099
00:47:52.433 --> 00:47:54.467
- Thank you.
- Thank you for having us.

1100
00:47:55.533 --> 00:47:56.567
Thank you. my babe.

1101
00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:58.000
You gonna be okay?

1102
00:47:58.133 --> 00:48:00.066
I am gonna be great.

1103
00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:02.500
I've got a dream wedding
to plan. huh?

1104
00:48:02.633 --> 00:48:04.967
I have no doubt
it will be beautiful!

1105
00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:07.633
If you need anything--

1106
00:48:07.767 --> 00:48:09.300
How about that deposit?

1107
00:48:09.433 --> 00:48:12.533
I'll wire it to your account
as soon as I get home!

1108
00:48:12.667 --> 00:48:15.567
I know you're good for it.

1109
00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:17.900
If anyone can do this.
Cassandra. you can.

1110
00:48:18.033 --> 00:48:19.734
Thank you.

1111
00:48:20.767 --> 00:48:21.834

- Yeah.

1112
00:48:21.967 --> 00:48:23.333

Weddings are now

1127
00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:13.433
Hey. Mary.

1128
00:49:13.567 --> 00:49:15.300
Thank you
for helping out today.

1129
00:49:15.433 --> 00:49:17.033
You're welcome.

1130
00:49:17.166 --> 00:49:18.333
Oh. You know what?

1131
00:49:18.467 --> 00:49:20.800
You can't forget to send me
a bill for all that hard work.

1132
00:49:20.934 --> 00:49:22.133
My dad said that

1133
00:49:22.266 --> 00:49:24.233
we're doing this
for Miss Emma and you.

1134
00:49:24.367 --> 00:49:27.033
Aw. That's very sweet of you.

1135
00:49:27.166 --> 00:49:28.100
And you.

1136
00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:32.533
But... Miss Emma
did give me ice cream

1137
00:49:32.667 --> 00:49:33.633
when I'd come
to the vineyard.

1138
00:49:33.767 --> 00:49:34.600
Did she?

1139
00:49:34.734 --> 00:49:35.934
Yup!

1140
00:49:36.066 --> 00:49:36.967
Mare.

1141
00:49:38.867 --> 00:49:41.467
You know. I think ice cream
in exchange for hard work

1142
00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:44.300
is a tradition
we need to keep going.

1143
00:49:44.433 --> 00:49:45.900
There's a Hansen's
around the corner.

1144
00:49:46.033 --> 00:49:47.266
and if I remember correctly.

1145
00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:49.600
they have
the best Rocky Road ever.

1146
00:49:49.734 --> 00:49:51.133
Dad. can we?

1147
00:49:51.266 --> 00:49:52.467
Yeah.

1148
00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:55.300
But you finish handing out all
your flyers first. all right?

1149
00:49:55.433 --> 00:49:57.467
A day's pay
for a day's work.

1150
00:49:58.767 --> 00:50:00.233
Mare!

1151
00:50:00.367 --> 00:50:01.600
Hey. wait for us. though!

1152
00:50:01.734 --> 00:50:03.767
Come on.

1153
00:50:05.033 --> 00:50:06.400
Love me some chocolate.

1154
00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:10.867
Hey. Dad. There's Phoebe.
Can I go say hi?

1155
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.033
Yeah. yeah. sure.
Go ahead.

1156
00:50:12.166 --> 00:50:13.734
Okay.

1157
00:50:13.867 --> 00:50:15.233
You know. everyone
I talked to today

1158
00:50:15.367 --> 00:50:17.066
seemed really excited

1159
00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:19.533
about the resurgence
of Eloi Weddings.

1160
00:50:19.667 --> 00:50:20.600
Mm-hmm.

1161
00:50:20.734 --> 00:50:21.934
Are you okay with that?

1162
00:50:22.066 --> 00:50:25.133
I'm sure this kicks up
some dust for you.

1163
00:50:25.266 --> 00:50:27.700
No. No. I'm fine.

1164
00:50:27.834 --> 00:50:30.700
See. I consider myself a...
dust-free zone.

1165
00:50:30.834 --> 00:50:32.700
- Really?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1166
00:50:32.834 --> 00:50:34.233
"Dust-free zone"?

1167
00:50:34.367 --> 00:50:36.633
I prefer
to focus on what I had.

1168
00:50:36.767 --> 00:50:39.600
rather than. you know.
what I've lost.

1169
00:50:39.734 --> 00:50:41.867
Your grandmother taught me that.

1170
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.734
It sounds like she learned
some pretty valuable lessons

1171
00:50:45.867 --> 00:50:47.133
later in life.

1172
00:50:47.266 --> 00:50:49.233
Yeah. I just hope
that Mary can grow up

1173
00:50:49.367 --> 00:50:51.066
to be as strong
and self-assured

1174
00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:52.700
as you are.

1175
00:50:52.834 --> 00:50:54.633
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

1176
00:50:54.767 --> 00:50:56.967
That almost sounded
like a compliment. Alec.

1177
00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:59.633
Oh. maybe just a little bit.
A little bit.

1178
00:51:03.967 --> 00:51:05.633
Hey. You having fun. kiddo?

1179
00:51:05.767 --> 00:51:07.200
Yes. but...

1180
00:51:07.333 --> 00:51:09.700
it would be even more fun
if I had another scoop.

1181
00:51:09.834 --> 00:51:11.100
Another scoop?

1182
00:51:11.233 --> 00:51:12.000
Yes.

1183
00:51:12.133 --> 00:51:13.133
You haven't finished
what I gave you.

1184
00:51:13.266 --> 00:51:15.266
But. like. I can already tell
this isn't enough.

1185
00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:16.800
It's. like. one crumb.

1186
00:51:18.567 --> 00:51:19.700
Please?

1187
00:51:19.834 --> 00:51:20.800
No.

00:51:20.934 --> 00:51:22.133
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

No. No!

You do not encourage her.

1192
00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:27.300

Cassandra?

1199
00:51:43.233 --> 00:51:44.433
Cassan--

1200
00:51:44.567 --> 00:51:45.500
Oh. my gosh!

1201
00:51:45.633 --> 00:51:47.834
Ohh.

1202
00:51:47.967 --> 00:51:49.767
Are you trying to give me
a heart attack?

1203
00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:52.867
It's about time this old place
had a good dusting.

1204
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.633
Dust-free zone. right?

1205
00:51:54.767 --> 00:51:56.033
Ohh.

1206
00:51:56.166 --> 00:51:57.767
Oh! I almost forgot.

1207
00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:00.300
All right.

1208
00:52:07.567 --> 00:52:09.400
Oh...

1209
00:52:09.533 --> 00:52:11.133
Is this...

1210
00:52:12.467 --> 00:52:14.333
This is Mom's painting.

1211
00:52:14.467 --> 00:52:17.000
This painting
was the centerpiece of this room

1212
00:52:17.133 --> 00:52:18.333
for decades.

1213
00:52:18.467 --> 00:52:22.033
I guess it meant a lot to Emma
that your mom gave it to her.

1214
00:52:22.166 --> 00:52:23.633
She didn't.

1215
00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:28.233
No. Someone bought this
from a gallery in Santa Barbara

1216
00:52:28.367 --> 00:52:29.367
years ago.

1217
00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:31.967
We just never knew who it was.

1218
00:52:33.166 --> 00:52:34.266
She was proud of her.
wasn't she?

1219
00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:35.767
Oh. yes!

1220
00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:38.033
Very much so.

1221
00:52:47.367 --> 00:52:49.767
won't be ready in time. woe

1222
00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:51.800
Yeah. Yeah.
it's a whole lot of work.

1223
00:52:51.934 --> 00:52:54.767
but I really believe
in this. Angela.

1224
00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:57.266
I don't know
what I can do to help.

1225
00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:58.567
but say the word.

1226
00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:01.367
Just promise me
you won't tell Lena.

1227
00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:02.367
I don't want her to feel bad

1228
00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:04.533
about all the stress
this is causing me.

1229
00:53:04.667 --> 00:53:05.800
I can send you some money.

1230
00:53:05.934 --> 00:53:07.900
Absolutely not.

1231
00:53:08.033 --> 00:53:09.533
Girl! Stop trying
to be a martyr all the time.

1232
00:53:09.667 --> 00:53:11.400
Martyrs die. you know.

1233
00:53:11.533 --> 00:53:13.734
I am not trying to be
a martyr. trust me.

1234
00:53:15.266 --> 00:53:16.800
Look. I gotta go.

1235
00:53:16.934 --> 00:53:18.667
Yeah. okay.

1236
00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:20.467
But call me if you need me.

1237
00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:21.834
I will.

1238
00:53:21.967 --> 00:53:23.467
Love you. Angela.

1239
00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:24.567
Love you. too.

1240
00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:26.333
Take care.

1241
00:53:30.367 --> 00:53:31.500
I heard that.

1242
00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:37.066
I'll be fine.

1243
00:53:38.767 --> 00:53:41.233
Can I take you somewhere?

1244
00:53:41.367 --> 00:53:43.767
Come on.

1245
00:53:58.467 --> 00:54:01.133
When my wife first got sick...

1246
00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:05.066
...I was so angry.

1247
00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:08.967
You know.
she was so strong.

1248
00:54:11.533 --> 00:54:14.266
I was. uh. I was lost.

1249
00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:17.233
I. uh. I just couldn't
process it all.

1250
00:54:17.367 --> 00:54:18.934
and then one day.
your grandma.

1251
00:54:19.066 --> 00:54:21.367
she brought me up here.

1252
00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:25.133
She told me to give all my anger
and grief to the sky.

1253
00:54:25.266 --> 00:54:28.433
so when it gets too much.
I just--

1254
00:54:34.567 --> 00:54:36.133
Ooh!

1255
00:54:37.667 --> 00:54:39.700
Yeah. I'm not doing that.

1256
00:54:39.834 --> 00:54:42.200
Hey. listen. Cassandra.
Can I make an observation?

1257
00:54:42.333 --> 00:54:45.734
Now. everybody knows
that you are capable.

1258
00:54:45.867 --> 00:54:49.900
You don't have to hold it
together all of the time.

1259
00:54:51.333 --> 00:54:53.533
Yes. I do.

1260
00:54:53.667 --> 00:54:54.767
Why?

1261
00:54:56.233 --> 00:54:58.567
Because no one
will take me seriously

1262
00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:00.500
if they see the cracks
in the veneer.

1263
00:55:03.233 --> 00:55:04.233
Well. you know. sometimes.

1264
00:55:04.367 --> 00:55:07.467
the cracks are there
so the light shines through.

1265
00:55:10.567 --> 00:55:14.300
I just want you to know
that. as long as I'm around.

1266
00:55:14.433 --> 00:55:17.033
you don't
have to go at it alone.

1267
00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:21.500
I got you.

1268
00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:27.300
The sky's got you.

1269
00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:02.266
♪ Take a little bit off
your morning ♪

1270
00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:07.533
♪ Give a little bit
off your day ♪

1271
00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:12.066

1272
00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:13.533
All right. have a good day.

1273
00:56:13.667 --> 00:56:14.734
Appreciate it.

1274
00:56:14.867 --> 00:56:18.400
♪ You must think I'm crazy ♪

1275
00:56:18.533 --> 00:56:23.066
♪ To stay this way ♪

1276
00:56:24.467 --> 00:56:26.567
Is this what you use
to water the grapes?

1277
00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:29.233
No. no. This is what we use
to give water to our plants.

1278
00:56:29.367 --> 00:56:30.900
It's an irrigation system.

1279
00:56:31.033 --> 00:56:34.100
Mm-hmm. All right.
I'll take that from you.

1280
00:56:34.233 --> 00:56:35.166
Oh!

1281
00:56:36.533 --> 00:56:37.867
Oh. you think that's funny?

1282
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:38.834
- Just a little.
- Yeah? Yeah?

1283
00:56:38.967 --> 00:56:39.767
No. no. no.

1284
00:56:46.567 --> 00:56:47.867
No. no!

1285
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:48.967
No!

1286
00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:53.667
Oh. yes. I can save the 11th
for a few days.

1287
00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:55.734
Okay. just fill out the forms
on our website.

1288
00:56:55.867 --> 00:56:58.233
submit your deposit.
and you're good to go.

1289
00:56:58.367 --> 00:56:59.934
We're excited. too.

1290
00:57:00.133 --> 00:57:02.800
Bye.

1291
00:57:02.934 --> 00:57:04.900
This place
is feeling alive again!

1292
00:57:05.033 --> 00:57:05.834
And it's all thanks to you!

1293
00:57:05.967 --> 00:57:08.567
Thanks to us.

1294
00:57:11.867 --> 00:57:14.100
Hey. Alec.

1295
00:57:14.233 --> 00:57:16.166
Oh. I'd love to join
you and Mary.

1296
00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:17.166
Okay.

1297
00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:18.500
See you soon.

1298
00:57:20.967 --> 00:57:23.734
Don't start. Isabel.

1299
00:57:23.867 --> 00:57:25.400
It's just a movie.

1300
00:57:25.533 --> 00:57:26.467
Who. me?

1301
00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:29.133
I'm not saying a word.

1302
00:57:29.266 --> 00:57:30.767
Whatcha gonna wear
on your date?

1303
00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:32.133
Isabel!

1304
00:57:36.033 --> 00:57:37.800
Can I go get some candy?

1305
00:57:37.934 --> 00:57:40.133
Yeah. but nothing king-size.

1306
00:57:40.266 --> 00:57:41.166
Okay.

1307
00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:42.600
All right? There you go.

1308
00:57:42.734 --> 00:57:44.900
Mary.
How about some gummy bears?

1309
00:57:45.033 --> 00:57:46.166
- Okay.
- Okay?

1310
00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:47.233
Yeah.

1311
00:57:47.367 --> 00:57:49.400
We'll wait here for you.

1312
00:57:49.533 --> 00:57:50.834
- Okay.
- Okay.

1313
00:57:50.967 --> 00:57:53.000
She is adorable.

1314
00:57:53.133 --> 00:57:54.667
She... is her mom.

1315
00:57:56.266 --> 00:58:00.066
Everything-- curious.
precocious. kind.

1316
00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:03.200
and infuriating.

1317
00:58:03.333 --> 00:58:04.834
I know that you miss her.

1318
00:58:07.166 --> 00:58:09.834
Well. the hardest part.
really. is...

1319
00:58:09.967 --> 00:58:12.266
Mary being robbed
of life with her mom.

1320
00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:17.233
It has been six years
since Shelly died.

1321
00:58:18.700 --> 00:58:20.867
Everyone's telling me
I should get out there. too.

1322
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:21.800
Do they?

1323
00:58:21.934 --> 00:58:23.066
Mm-hmm.

1324
00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:24.300
Hmm.

1325
00:58:24.433 --> 00:58:25.967
What do you think?

1326
00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:27.533
Well. I think
that's for you to decide.

1327
00:58:27.667 --> 00:58:28.700
not them.

1328
00:58:29.934 --> 00:58:31.700
I guess...

1329
00:58:31.834 --> 00:58:33.500
I guess I have a hard time
seeing myself

1330
00:58:33.633 --> 00:58:35.133
with anybody else.

1331
00:58:35.266 --> 00:58:37.200
You know. it's weird. but...

1332
00:58:37.333 --> 00:58:39.800
I don't know. I feel like
I'd be betraying her.

1333
00:58:39.934 --> 00:58:43.667
Ah. So is that how you become
"the uncatchable catch"?

1334
00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:44.867
Oh!

1335
00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:47.834
Oh. is that what
they're saying about me?

1336
00:58:47.967 --> 00:58:50.333
Ah! I'm just saying.

1337
00:58:50.467 --> 00:58:53.633
Look. no. no.
I get it.

1338
00:58:53.767 --> 00:58:55.133
But lately. I've been
thinking about something

1339
00:58:55.266 --> 00:58:58.300
my mom told me
after my last break-up.

1340
00:58:58.433 --> 00:59:00.633
She said. "when happiness
walks out of your life

1341
00:59:00.767 --> 00:59:02.633
and you think
it's gone for good.

1342
00:59:02.767 --> 00:59:04.433
it's not.

1343
00:59:04.567 --> 00:59:06.200
You've just got
to keep the light on

1344
00:59:06.333 --> 00:59:07.867
and the door unlocked."

1345
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.467
Hmm.

1346
00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:12.867
That is good advice.

1347
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.033
Mm.

1348
00:59:14.166 --> 00:59:15.033
Maybe you should take it.

1349
00:59:15.166 --> 00:59:16.800
I think maybe we both should.

1350
00:59:25.533 --> 00:59:26.734
I said no king-size!

1351
00:59:26.867 --> 00:59:29.367
This is all they had.

1352
00:59:31.166 --> 00:59:34.400
Ooh! All my favorite colors.
Good job. Mary!

1353
00:59:34.533 --> 00:59:36.233
Well. you're gonna have
to share it with me--

1354
00:59:36.367 --> 00:59:37.200
then I want some of--

1355
00:59:37.333 --> 00:59:38.200
No!

1356
00:59:38.333 --> 00:59:39.800
Mm-mm.

1357
00:59:39.934 --> 00:59:41.100
Come on. Mary.

1358
00:59:53.133 --> 00:59:54.967
Whatcha looking at?

1359
00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:56.800
Oh. nothing.

1360
00:59:56.934 --> 00:59:59.433
It's just a beautiful day.

1361
00:59:59.567 --> 01:00:01.200
A very beautiful day.

1362
01:00:03.734 --> 01:00:05.300
Uh-huh.

1363
01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:18.200
Ah. yes. yes. yes.

1364
01:00:23.233 --> 01:00:24.266
Mm!

1365
01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.433
Finally bearing fruit.

1366
01:00:26.567 --> 01:00:28.800
See. this is where
our hard work pays off.

1367
01:00:28.934 --> 01:00:31.500
This is exciting. Alec.
but I'm still nervous.

1368
01:00:31.633 --> 01:00:32.934
We still need
to finish the barn.

1369
01:00:33.066 --> 01:00:34.667
and it's taking
longer than expected.

1370
01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:35.600
Well. that happens sometimes

1371
01:00:35.734 --> 01:00:36.867
when you have to go
into the walls.

1372
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.533
Ah. and that's what makes
the budget go up and up and up.

1373
01:00:39.667 --> 01:00:41.433
Well. then. we need
to book some more weddings.

1374
01:00:41.567 --> 01:00:42.500
"We"?

1375
01:00:42.633 --> 01:00:43.633
Come on now.

1376
01:00:43.767 --> 01:00:45.467
I'm invested in you. Cassandra.

1377
01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.467
This place. Eloi.

1378
01:00:50.767 --> 01:00:52.133
Oh. no.

1379
01:00:52.266 --> 01:00:54.367
She's coming
to check the progress.

1380
01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:56.166
Hey. girl!

1381
01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:57.300
- Hey. girl.
- What's up?

1382
01:00:57.433 --> 01:00:58.867
Oh...

1383
01:01:01.166 --> 01:01:02.900
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

1384
01:01:03.033 --> 01:01:04.433
Cassandra.

1385
01:01:05.867 --> 01:01:07.233
Hey. Dan.

1386
01:01:07.367 --> 01:01:08.533
- Alec.
- Nice to meet you.

1387
01:01:08.667 --> 01:01:09.533
- Pleasure.
- So good to see you!

1388
01:01:09.667 --> 01:01:11.100
We came into town
to meet with the caterer.

1389
01:01:11.233 --> 01:01:13.100
and figured we'd see
how things are going here.

1390
01:01:13.233 --> 01:01:15.400
Great. Great.
Everything's great!

1391
01:01:15.533 --> 01:01:17.400
- Yeah.
- Yeah. It looks...

1392
01:01:17.533 --> 01:01:18.567
It looks like it's...

1393
01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:20.100
going.

1394
01:01:20.233 --> 01:01:21.066
Dan. Dan...

1395
01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:23.500
in the midst of chaos.
there is order.

1396
01:01:23.633 --> 01:01:26.066
Huh? All right.
Why don't you guys come inside?

1397
01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:28.066
Our latest case of Chardonnay
is ready.

1398
01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:30.200
and you two can be
the first to taste it.

1399
01:01:30.333 --> 01:01:31.266
- It's ready?
- It is so ready.

1400
01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.033
Okay. It's right over there.
Let's get inside.

1401
01:01:33.166 --> 01:01:34.266
- I'm thirsty.
- Come on. baby?

1402
01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:35.266
- And you're thirsty?
- Yeah.

1403
01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:36.266
Mm.

1404
01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:37.567
Ooh!

1405
01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:39.433
Way to deflect. Counselor.

1406
01:01:39.567 --> 01:01:41.433
I try.

1407
01:01:44.734 --> 01:01:45.900
Where's the label?

1408
01:01:46.033 --> 01:01:47.567
Still working on it.

1409
01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:50.500
I'll eventually come up
with something.

1410
01:01:50.633 --> 01:01:51.934
So. four weeks.

1411
01:01:52.066 --> 01:01:53.567
Cassie. you think
it'll be ready?

1412
01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:55.200
Of course. it'll be ready.

1413
01:01:55.333 --> 01:01:56.433
Lena. it's your big day.

1414
01:01:56.567 --> 01:01:58.066
I got this!

1415
01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:00.100
That. and Alec is always
on top of things.

1416
01:02:00.233 --> 01:02:02.900
You two seem
to be getting along.

1417
01:02:03.033 --> 01:02:04.467
And you're actually
letting him help.

1418
01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:05.734
Who are you?

1419
01:02:05.867 --> 01:02:08.266
He's great at what he does.
Why wouldn't I let him help?

1420
01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:09.667
Girl. don't act like
you're not

1421
01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:12.166
Miss "I Can Install
My Own Garbage Disposal".

1422
01:02:14.533 --> 01:02:15.600
But good for you!

1423
01:02:15.734 --> 01:02:18.834
Maybe you can let him help you
with a few other things!

1424
01:02:18.967 --> 01:02:19.734
Lena. don't go there.

1425
01:02:19.867 --> 01:02:22.300
Seriously. this life
agrees with you.

1426
01:02:22.433 --> 01:02:23.633
You're different.
I don't know...

1427
01:02:23.767 --> 01:02:25.000
softer?

1428
01:02:25.133 --> 01:02:27.100
Calmer. Less stressed!

1429
01:02:27.233 --> 01:02:29.433
Mm. Trust me.
I am fully stressed.

1430
01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:32.934
But I don't know. Lena.
it's a different kind of stress.

1431
01:02:33.066 --> 01:02:34.900
Like. a meaningful stress.

1432
01:02:35.033 --> 01:02:36.100
Wow.

1433
01:02:36.233 --> 01:02:37.633
It feels like Zen stress.

1434
01:02:37.767 --> 01:02:39.166
the way you just explained
all of that to me.

1435
01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:40.467
-"Zen stress"?
- Yeah. Yeah. I told you.

1436
01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.133
Me? Zen?

1437
01:02:42.266 --> 01:02:43.567
Yes! That's what
this is doing to you!

1438
01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:44.834
Cassandra? Zen?

1439
01:02:44.967 --> 01:02:47.000
Hey. baby.

1440
01:02:47.133 --> 01:02:49.300
So Alec here was telling me
about this bar in town.

1441
01:02:49.433 --> 01:02:50.333
Mm-hmm.

1442
01:02:50.467 --> 01:02:51.400
Yeah. It's '90s night.

1443
01:02:51.533 --> 01:02:53.133
I think we should all go.

1444
01:02:53.266 --> 01:02:54.333
Yeah. You know.
Mary's at a sleep over.

1445
01:02:54.467 --> 01:02:55.633
so I'm game.

1446
01:02:55.767 --> 01:02:57.300
What do you say. Cassandra?

1447
01:02:57.433 --> 01:02:59.500
Hmm. I think
I am game. too.

1448
01:02:59.633 --> 01:03:00.700
Oh!

1449
01:03:00.834 --> 01:03:03.467
Let me just go and change
and jazz things up a bit.

1450
01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:04.834
- Oh...
- There she goes.

1451
01:03:04.967 --> 01:03:07.133
Look at that walk!
Okay. Missy. Okay.

1452
01:03:07.266 --> 01:03:09.467
Babe. look at this view.

1453
01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:10.667
It's breathtaking.

1454
01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:12.133
We're gonna get married here.

1455
01:03:12.266 --> 01:03:14.533
It's gonna be amazing.

1456
01:03:14.667 --> 01:03:16.367
- Gorgeous.
- Mm-hmm.

1457
01:03:21.967 --> 01:03:24.633

running a vineyard.

1459
01:03:28.667 --> 01:03:29.533
Who would've thought?

1460
01:03:29.667 --> 01:03:31.200
Yes. She traded in
those red-bottomed heels

1461
01:03:31.333 --> 01:03:33.033
for rubber mud boots.

1462
01:03:33.166 --> 01:03:35.533
And I am
a little surprised myself.

1463
01:03:35.667 --> 01:03:38.367
but I guess it's just
another part of my DNA.

1464
01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:40.000
Great!

1465
01:03:40.133 --> 01:03:41.333
So I can have the heels?

1466
01:03:41.467 --> 01:03:43.567
Uh. no.
Trust and believe

1467
01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:46.300
I will be rocking those as soon
as I get back to the firm.

1468
01:03:46.433 --> 01:03:49.967
Ah. yes. Right.
I keep forgetting that part.

1469
01:03:51.533 --> 01:03:52.500
So tell me this.

1470
01:03:52.633 --> 01:03:55.500
What happens with the vineyard
when you go back?

1471
01:03:56.567 --> 01:03:58.600
I don't know. I haven't
thought that far ahead.

1472
01:03:59.767 --> 01:04:01.633
But my focus

1473
01:04:01.767 --> 01:04:03.567
is getting things
up and running now.

1474
01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:05.700
living in the moment.

1475
01:04:05.834 --> 01:04:07.200
Look at you!

1476
01:04:07.333 --> 01:04:09.600
I'm proud of you.

1477
01:04:09.734 --> 01:04:11.633
You could always hire Alec.

1478
01:04:11.767 --> 01:04:12.967
He seems
pretty indispensable.

1479
01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:15.266
He is.

1480
01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:17.300
He always shows up for me.

1481
01:04:17.433 --> 01:04:18.300
Mm.

1482
01:04:18.433 --> 01:04:19.633
And...

1483
01:04:19.767 --> 01:04:21.633
I always will.

1484
01:04:23.033 --> 01:04:24.633
And speaking of
showing up.

1485
01:04:24.767 --> 01:04:25.967
Mary is insisting

1486
01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:27.433
that you come
to her birthday dinner.

1487
01:04:27.567 --> 01:04:29.567
Go. Mary!

1488
01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:31.033
I would love to.

1489
01:04:31.166 --> 01:04:32.600
- Mm-hmm.
- Absolutely.

1490
01:04:32.734 --> 01:04:33.767
I will absolutely be there.

1491
01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:35.433
Cheers.

1492
01:04:35.567 --> 01:04:37.066
Cheers.

1493
01:04:46.567 --> 01:04:47.967
Oh. hold up! That's my jam!

1494
01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:49.467
Oh? Well. come on.

Oh. my feet.

1508
01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.333
- Your feet?
- My feet!

1509
01:05:32.467 --> 01:05:33.967
- Are you kidding me right now?
- The dancing!

1510
01:05:36.066 --> 01:05:38.767
Mm! What time is it?
Your girl is tired.

1511
01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:40.200
- It's 11:00.
- Really?

1512
01:05:40.333 --> 01:05:42.166
Oh. that long drive
must have worn me out.

1513
01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:44.166
It's 46 miles. Lena.

1514
01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:45.867
Well. I am a little buzzed
from all the wine.

1515
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.800
Point is.
I need to lay my head down.

1516
01:05:47.934 --> 01:05:50.667
Baby. can we head back
to the hotel now?

1517
01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:52.867
I don't know. Lena.
it's still--

1518
01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.433
...not too late

1519
01:05:54.567 --> 01:05:55.700
to watch a movie.
Mm-hmm!

1520
01:05:57.667 --> 01:05:58.600
Good night!

1521
01:05:58.734 --> 01:06:00.066
Good night. Lena.

1522
01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:01.200
- Mwah!
- Drive safe.

1523
01:06:01.333 --> 01:06:03.166
- Yeah.
- I will call you.

1524
01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:04.567
This was so much fun.

1525
01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:06.333
Mm. Mwah.

1526
01:06:06.467 --> 01:06:08.266
- See you.
- All right.

1527
01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:13.767
She is something else.

1528
01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:15.333
I like your friends.

1529
01:06:15.467 --> 01:06:17.500
Eh. I think
they kind of like you. too.

1530
01:06:17.633 --> 01:06:19.100
Mm-hmm.

1531
01:06:19.233 --> 01:06:20.033
- Just a little--
- Just a little bit?

1532
01:06:20.166 --> 01:06:21.333
Just a little bit.

1533
01:06:23.233 --> 01:06:27.433
I. uh. enjoyed
watching you let loose tonight.

1534
01:06:27.567 --> 01:06:29.200
Mm. I'm trying
to remember the last time

1535
01:06:29.333 --> 01:06:30.667
I did anything like that--

1536
01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:33.100
just threw caution to the wind.

1537
01:06:33.233 --> 01:06:35.266
not caring
if anyone was watching.

1538
01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:36.300
Yeah.

1539
01:06:36.433 --> 01:06:39.333
Something about this place
is so liberating.

1540
01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:41.900
Well. there's a lot to be said

1541
01:06:42.033 --> 01:06:43.834
for throwing caution
in the wind.

1542
01:06:43.967 --> 01:06:45.934
living in the moment.

1543
01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:51.834
You know. I...
I have to say something.

1544
01:06:51.967 --> 01:06:53.934
You know. I always felt

1545
01:06:54.066 --> 01:06:56.934
that we get
one great love in our life...

1546
01:06:57.066 --> 01:06:59.533
and that I already
used mine up.

1547
01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:02.567
And then you come around.

1548
01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:04.500
and I'm thinking

1549
01:07:04.633 --> 01:07:07.500
that maybe that part of my life
isn't over for me.

1550
01:07:08.967 --> 01:07:10.600
You know. it's like
your mom said...

1551
01:07:12.133 --> 01:07:14.967
...just because
happiness left you once

1552
01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:17.200
doesn't mean
it's gone for good.

1553
01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:24.934
Alec. you have no idea
how much you've changed me.

1554
01:07:26.633 --> 01:07:29.066
You are one of
the most beautiful people

1555
01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:31.400
I have ever met.

1556
01:07:32.533 --> 01:07:35.133
Okay.

1557
01:07:35.266 --> 01:07:37.767
But am I alone
in what I'm feeling?

1558
01:07:39.633 --> 01:07:41.467
No.

1559
01:07:42.967 --> 01:07:44.700
But it's complicated.

1560
01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:48.100
Why?

1561
01:07:50.133 --> 01:07:52.300
Because
this is temporary. Alec.

1562
01:07:52.433 --> 01:07:55.266
I'm not here forever.
and you already knew that.

1563
01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:57.100
Why can't you be?

1564
01:07:57.233 --> 01:07:59.333
It's not that simple.

1565
01:07:59.467 --> 01:08:01.633
But it is that simple.

1566
01:08:01.767 --> 01:08:04.533
You brought Eloi
back to life.

1567
01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:07.133
You belong there.

1568
01:08:07.266 --> 01:08:09.333
You--
You belong here.

1569
01:08:09.467 --> 01:08:10.900
Hmm?

1570
01:08:11.033 --> 01:08:13.233
With me.

1571
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.133
Alec!

1572
01:08:19.266 --> 01:08:20.900
Alec!

1573
01:08:21.033 --> 01:08:22.567
Whew!

1574
01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:25.100
Man. thank goodness.
you're still here.

1575
01:08:26.333 --> 01:08:27.700
Look. I'm-I'm sorry
to interrupt.

1576
01:08:27.834 --> 01:08:30.900
but. uh. my car won't start.

1577
01:08:31.033 --> 01:08:32.533
I'll meet you at your car
with some cables.

1578
01:08:32.667 --> 01:08:33.734
Thank you.

1579
01:08:33.867 --> 01:08:35.834
Okay.

1580
01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:45.600
Just think about
what I said. okay?

1581
01:09:04.533 --> 01:09:05.934
Hello?

1582
01:09:06.066 --> 01:09:07.500
Cassandra? Hi.

1583
01:09:07.633 --> 01:09:09.500
It's Thomas Lopez
from Napa Canyon Bank.

1584
01:09:09.633 --> 01:09:11.000
Thomas. Hi.

1585
01:09:11.133 --> 01:09:12.734
What can I do for you?

1586
01:09:12.867 --> 01:09:16.033
Your progress
is not going unnoticed.

1587
01:09:17.166 --> 01:09:20.266
We have a pretty prominent
client at the bank here

1588
01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:21.834
who wants me to reach out.

1589
01:09:21.967 --> 01:09:22.967
He likes
what he's hearing.

1590
01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:25.266
and he wants to make you
a very generous offer

1591
01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:27.000
to buy Eloi.

1592
01:09:27.133 --> 01:09:30.166
It'd be more than enough
to cover the outstanding loans

1593
01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:32.934
and give you a nice little chunk
of change in your pocket.

1594
01:09:33.066 --> 01:09:35.734
Well. this is
my family's vineyard. Thomas...

1595
01:09:35.867 --> 01:09:37.567
and I am not selling.

1596
01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:40.133
Oh. yes. I see.

1597
01:09:40.266 --> 01:09:42.667
Well. if you change your mind.
you know where to find me.

1598
01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:43.734
I look forward

1599
01:09:43.867 --> 01:09:45.300
to getting those overdue
payments tomorrow.

1600
01:09:45.433 --> 01:09:47.900
Yes. I'll see you soon.

1601
01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:58.800
Hold on now.

1602
01:10:58.934 --> 01:11:00.567
What. you sold your car?

1603
01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:02.333
I did.

1604
01:11:02.467 --> 01:11:04.767
Now I can finish
repairing the barn.

1605
01:11:05.834 --> 01:11:07.066
What happened to your savings?

1606
01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:09.133
That was gone
over two months ago.

1607
01:11:09.266 --> 01:11:11.500
Oh. wow. I. uh...

1608
01:11:11.633 --> 01:11:14.734
oh. I had no idea.

1609
01:11:14.867 --> 01:11:16.166
You know. listen to me.
I got money saved. I--

1610
01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:17.467
- No. Alec.
- No. really.

1611
01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:18.834
Just think of it as--
you know what?

1612
01:11:18.967 --> 01:11:19.834
As an investment.

1613
01:11:19.967 --> 01:11:21.500
A partnership.

1614
01:11:21.633 --> 01:11:23.133
Alec. look around here.

1615
01:11:23.266 --> 01:11:26.233
I have no idea when this place
is gonna be profitable again.

1616
01:11:26.367 --> 01:11:28.300
And even with
all those wedding deposits.

1617
01:11:28.433 --> 01:11:29.700
it's still not enough.

1618
01:11:29.834 --> 01:11:31.567
and I cannot let you
take that risk.

1619
01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:33.400
I know what
I'm getting myself into.

1620
01:11:33.533 --> 01:11:36.000
And I don't want it
on my shoulders.

1621
01:11:37.633 --> 01:11:39.200
I don't need
to be rescued. Alec.

1622
01:11:40.934 --> 01:11:42.834
You know that's not
what I'm doing.

1623
01:11:45.967 --> 01:11:47.834
I'll figure it out myself.

1624
01:11:53.934 --> 01:11:58.900
♪ No matter how many times
we just want to walk away ♪

1625
01:12:00.867 --> 01:12:01.767
♪ We still... ♪

1626
01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:02.967
Here you go.

1627
01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:04.700
Oh. why. thank you.

1628
01:12:04.834 --> 01:12:06.433
Happy birthday. Mary.

1629
01:12:07.767 --> 01:12:10.467
Thank you.
Can I open it now?

1630
01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:11.667
Yeah. sure.

1631
01:12:16.533 --> 01:12:17.934
A nail art kit!

1632
01:12:18.066 --> 01:12:19.567
I've always wanted it.

1633
01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:21.934
Oh. a little birdie told me.

1634
01:12:22.066 --> 01:12:24.300
It's me!
I am that little bird.

1635
01:12:25.867 --> 01:12:29.734
I love this sort of stuff.
but Dad's really bad at it.

1636
01:12:29.867 --> 01:12:32.033
Hey! I heard that.

1637
01:12:32.166 --> 01:12:33.734
She is not wrong.

1638
01:12:35.033 --> 01:12:36.467
Will you do it with me?

1639
01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:39.367
Oh. I'd love to.

1640
01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:41.767
Come to the house this weekend
with your dad.

1641
01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:44.600
and I'll take a little timeout
to give you a... manicure.

1642
01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.934
Oh. sweetie!

1643
01:12:52.033 --> 01:12:53.200
Thank you for the present.

1644
01:12:53.333 --> 01:12:55.333
And thank you for...
you know.

1645
01:12:58.066 --> 01:12:59.867
What. Mare?

1646
01:13:00.066 --> 01:13:01.333
Well. I don't know...

1647
01:13:01.467 --> 01:13:03.033
making my dad happy. too.
I guess.

1648
01:13:26.567 --> 01:13:27.633
Cassandra!

1649
01:13:27.767 --> 01:13:29.300
You have visitors.

1650
01:13:39.667 --> 01:13:41.133
I like these frogs.

1651
01:13:41.266 --> 01:13:42.467
What do you think?

1652
01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:44.200
Oh. the green frogs
will look perfect

1653
01:13:44.333 --> 01:13:45.667
on top of this pink.

1654
01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:48.266
I think so. too.
Let's do that.

1655
01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:50.300
Okay. Let's do it.

1656
01:13:50.433 --> 01:13:53.433
Ahem. sorry to interrupt
beauty hour.

1657
01:13:53.567 --> 01:13:55.800
but could I just borrow you
for a minute outside. Cassandra?

1658
01:13:55.934 --> 01:13:58.133
I-Is something wrong?

1659
01:13:58.266 --> 01:13:59.800
Just come on outside.

1660
01:13:59.934 --> 01:14:01.867
Okay. I'll be right back.

1661
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.567
Don't mess those up. Okay?

1662
01:14:14.834 --> 01:14:16.100
Toxic mold?

1663
01:14:16.233 --> 01:14:17.100
Yeah.

1664
01:14:17.233 --> 01:14:18.767
Enough that
you're gonna need to call in

1665
01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:20.567
a professional
remediation company.

1666
01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:22.567
How long is that gonna take?

1667
01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:25.433
We've only got 10 days
before Lena's wedding.

1668
01:14:25.567 --> 01:14:28.533
It is not the "how long"
that concerns me.

1669
01:14:30.033 --> 01:14:31.467
How much?

1670
01:14:34.467 --> 01:14:36.867
Alec. I can't do this anymore.

1671
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.900
I've got nothing left
to give.

1672
01:14:39.033 --> 01:14:40.900
Oh. I can help you pay for it.

1673
01:14:41.033 --> 01:14:42.934
This isn't about money.

1674
01:14:43.066 --> 01:14:45.333
I've given
my blood. sweat. tears.

1675
01:14:45.467 --> 01:14:46.500
even my car.

1676
01:14:46.633 --> 01:14:49.233
and I still have nothing
but failure to show for it.

1677
01:14:49.367 --> 01:14:50.567
Yeah. It's a setback.
but you know what?

1678
01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:51.667
We can figure it out.

1679
01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:53.767
There is no "we". Alec.

1680
01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:55.934
This is my problem.

1681
01:14:56.066 --> 01:14:58.767
Why do you keep
pushing me away?

1682
01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:01.100
I mean. it's like you're looking
for a reason to run.

1683
01:15:01.233 --> 01:15:03.767
You think you've got me
all figured out. don't you?

1684
01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:05.133
No. I think that you're scared.

1685
01:15:05.266 --> 01:15:07.333
I'm not scared.
I'm done.

1686
01:15:07.467 --> 01:15:09.467
Look at this place!

1687
01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:10.834
Look how much it's changed.

1688
01:15:10.967 --> 01:15:11.934
It's all because of you!

1689
01:15:14.433 --> 01:15:17.166
But it's still not enough.

1690
01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:23.734
Alec. I have decided
to accept an offer to sell Eloi

1691
01:15:23.867 --> 01:15:27.200
and go back to the law firm.
where I belong.

1692
01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:30.100
You're leaving?

1693
01:15:30.233 --> 01:15:32.834
I'm so sorry. sweetie.

1694
01:15:32.967 --> 01:15:34.834
but it's time for me
to go back home.

1695
01:15:50.867 --> 01:15:53.200
Yes. Hank.
I'm really coming back.

1696
01:15:53.333 --> 01:15:55.967
Oh! I've never been happier
to hear anything in my life.

1697
01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:57.800
So when are you coming?

1698
01:15:57.934 --> 01:15:59.900
Still got some loose ends
to tie up here.

1699
01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:03.066
but I've got a call with Joyce
and Frank Wheeler tomorrow.

1700
01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:05.300
Oh. So. what happened?

1701
01:16:05.433 --> 01:16:06.767
Did you get your heart broken
or something?

1702
01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:08.300
It's just like what you said.

1703
01:16:08.433 --> 01:16:12.033
I am a wine drinker.
not a winemaker.

1704
01:16:12.166 --> 01:16:13.633
Come in!

1705
01:16:13.767 --> 01:16:15.233
All right. Gotta go.

1706
01:16:15.367 --> 01:16:17.367
I'll keep you posted
on my plans.

1707
01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:18.900
Bye.

1708
01:16:19.033 --> 01:16:20.800
Here you go. boss.

1709
01:16:20.934 --> 01:16:22.567
First case
of the finished product--

1710
01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:23.867
'21 Chardonnay.

1711
01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.433
And?

1712
01:16:25.567 --> 01:16:28.300
And... I think
it's gonna be real big.

1713
01:16:28.433 --> 01:16:30.066
Maybe even bigger than
the 2014 Cab.

1714
01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:32.367
Great.

1715
01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:35.133
Um... and what about the. um...

1716
01:16:36.533 --> 01:16:37.800
See for yourself.

1717
01:16:37.934 --> 01:16:39.934
Oh. wow...

1718
01:16:45.166 --> 01:16:47.767
Look at that!

1719
01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:51.567
The wine may pre-date you.
but you did the rest.

1720
01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:53.367
Your first run!

1721
01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:56.300
Now. that cork
is going in this bowl now.

1722
01:16:56.433 --> 01:16:58.800
Your grandma is smilin'
her face off!

1723
01:17:01.333 --> 01:17:03.633
Wow.

1724
01:17:12.433 --> 01:17:13.633
Dad?

1725
01:17:13.767 --> 01:17:15.333
I remember the day
she painted this.

1726
01:17:15.467 --> 01:17:16.967
She called it "Evelyn's Ire"

1727
01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:17.967
because she was mad at me

1728
01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:20.367
for never putting dishes
in the dishwasher.

1729
01:17:21.633 --> 01:17:23.533
That was her inspiration?

1730
01:17:23.667 --> 01:17:26.367
She always took out
her aggression on canvases.

1731
01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:29.667
Her best work
transpired after we left Eloi.

1732
01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:31.333
She never did learn
who bought this one

1733
01:17:31.467 --> 01:17:33.233
from that gallery
in Santa Barbara.

1734
01:17:33.367 --> 01:17:35.200
Now we know.

1735
01:17:35.333 --> 01:17:37.333
Dad...

1736
01:17:37.467 --> 01:17:39.567
what are you doing here?

1737
01:17:43.166 --> 01:17:44.734
I was...

1738
01:17:44.867 --> 01:17:46.867
in the neighborhood.

1739
01:17:56.433 --> 01:17:58.133
You know how Emma
wrote you a letter

1740
01:17:58.266 --> 01:18:01.066
right before she died?

1741
01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:02.233
Well...

1742
01:18:02.367 --> 01:18:05.300
it's all right here. Cassie.

1743
01:18:06.433 --> 01:18:08.633
You mother didn't get
to send it to Emma before she...

1744
01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:13.433
She never wanted to leave Eloi.

1745
01:18:13.567 --> 01:18:14.800
Not really.

1746
01:18:14.934 --> 01:18:18.367
She regretted it
every day of her life.

1747
01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:20.300
She did it for me.

1748
01:18:20.433 --> 01:18:22.166
out of love for me.

1749
01:18:25.066 --> 01:18:27.333
I wanted to be a lawyer
in the big city.

1750
01:18:29.066 --> 01:18:32.700
I robbed her of what
she really wanted to do.

1751
01:18:32.834 --> 01:18:34.367
I robbed you

1752
01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.400
and your grandmother.

1753
01:18:36.533 --> 01:18:39.433
Oh. It's okay. Daddy.

1754
01:18:39.567 --> 01:18:40.767
I messed up.

1755
01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:42.233
But I'm gonna fix it.

1756
01:18:42.367 --> 01:18:44.533
I'm not gonna stand
in the way of your dream

1757
01:18:44.667 --> 01:18:46.266
like I did with your mother.

1758
01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:47.600
You're gonna make this
work. Cassie.

1759
01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:50.533
No. I'm not.

1760
01:18:50.667 --> 01:18:53.700
I couldn't get it to work.

1761
01:18:53.834 --> 01:18:55.600
Whoa... whoa.

1762
01:18:55.734 --> 01:18:57.767
That's not the daughter I know.

1763
01:18:57.900 --> 01:18:59.300
Where's that Cassandra spirit?

1764
01:18:59.433 --> 01:19:01.633
It got killed by toxic mold.

1765
01:19:01.767 --> 01:19:05.033
I can't afford the repairs. Dad.

1766
01:19:05.166 --> 01:19:06.567
I can't save Eloi.

1767
01:19:10.233 --> 01:19:11.867
You can finish the job...

1768
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.200
and you will.

1769
01:19:13.333 --> 01:19:15.000
We will.

1770
01:19:15.133 --> 01:19:17.166
You wouldn't let me
pay off your student loans.

1771
01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:19.266
At least let me
help you do this.

1772
01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:20.834
I owe it to you

1773
01:19:20.967 --> 01:19:21.867
and your mom

1774
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.367

Yeah.

1777
01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:28.800
I'm so sorry. honey.

1778
01:19:28.934 --> 01:19:31.467
I learned a hard lesson
a little too late.

1779
01:19:32.734 --> 01:19:34.000
Promise me you won't make
the same mistake

1780

who supports your dream.

no matter what.

from the remediation company

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.266
already started.

1810
01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:38.166
but the contractor called.

1811
01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:40.834
He's gonna need those plans
that are on your laptop.

1812
01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:43.100

Uh. what happened to selling?

1816
01:20:47.667 --> 01:20:49.000
My dad.

1817
01:20:49.133 --> 01:20:51.333
He put up the money
for the remediation

1818
01:20:51.467 --> 01:20:54.266
and offered to finance
a few other projects.

1819
01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:56.633
but I told him
I wanted to do it myself.

1820
01:20:57.600 --> 01:20:58.867
Mm.

01:21:00.867 --> 01:21:03.100
