1
00:00:10.213 --> 00:00:11.796
[woman]  Come on. can't you go any faster?

2
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.880
[man]  Kate. FDNY says six people are
trapped in the fire. Are you there yet?

3
00:00:14.963 --> 00:00:16.921
[Kate] Yeah. almost.
Go. go. go. Park right there.

4
00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:18.505
[man 2] Yeah. yeah. I see it. I see it.

5
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.005
[man 1]  Coming to you live
in five minutes.

6
00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:23.463
-[Kate] Okay. we'll be ready.
-[man 2] We've got this.

7
00:00:23.546 --> 00:00:25.546
[man 1]  Four engines on the scene.
More on the way.

8
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.963
-Got feet on the ground yet?
- Yeah. we just got here.

9
00:00:28.046 --> 00:00:30.546
[man 1]  Get some cutaways.
We'll do a stand-up on the third block.

10
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.546
No. David. it's no good.

11
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.005
The police have the media
at least 50 yards out.

12
00:00:35.338 --> 00:00:36.880
I'm gonna get us something exclusive.

13
00:00:36.963 --> 00:00:40.046
-How are you gonna do that?
-You know the drill.   Give me the camera.

14
00:00:40.671 --> 00:00:41.505
Thanks.

15
00:00:41.588 --> 00:00:42.921
[sirens wailing]

16
00:00:44.963 --> 00:00:46.796
-Hey.
-Sir. please stay away from the barricade.

17
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.921
I just had a quick question.
Do you know how this--

18
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:50.463
Sorry.

19
00:00:52.713 --> 00:00:53.546
Sorry about that. man.

20
00:00:54.338 --> 00:00:55.463
All thumbs today.

21
00:01:06.713 --> 00:01:08.963
[man 1] Need a ladder. south side.
Close up!

22
00:01:09.046 --> 00:01:10.921
[man 2] Need Charlie up
on the second floor.

23
00:01:11.546 --> 00:01:13.171
[man 3] Need more pressure here.

24
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.088
[man 4] Open it up.
We need more pressure on this one.

25
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.880
[man 5] They're EMT. let 'em through.

26
00:01:17.963 --> 00:01:19.963
[man 6] Come on. guys. We gotta move here.

27
00:01:20.505 --> 00:01:21.505
[woman] Come on. guys.

28
00:01:22.755 --> 00:01:24.838
[man 1]
Block that window out. Block that window.

29
00:01:25.171 --> 00:01:26.588
[man 2] Give me a hand here.

30
00:01:27.755 --> 00:01:28.963
[man] Hey!

31
00:01:29.046 --> 00:01:31.421
You've gotta get out of here now.
This fire is out of control.

32
00:01:31.505 --> 00:01:33.171
It's okay. I've done this before.

33
00:01:33.255 --> 00:01:34.671
Not like this. you haven't.

34
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.713
Look out!

35
00:01:41.838 --> 00:01:42.671
Thank you.

36
00:01:43.338 --> 00:01:44.546
You should get out now.

37
00:01:45.338 --> 00:01:47.255
[woman]  It's very hard to get any real...

38
00:01:47.338 --> 00:01:48.421
[David]  Ten seconds. Kate.

39
00:01:48.505 --> 00:01:50.671
Yeah. Yeah. copy that. I'll be ready.

40
00:01:50.755 --> 00:01:53.505
[man] Just make sure you get that. Good.

41
00:01:54.046 --> 00:01:57.046
In five. four. three...

42
00:01:58.421 --> 00:02:01.255
Channel 12 News 
has obtained exclusive footage

43
00:02:01.338 --> 00:02:05.838
of firefighters battling the blaze 
at this abandoned warehouse in Brooklyn.

44
00:02:06.255 --> 00:02:08.380
New York City's finest at the FDNY

45
00:02:08.463 --> 00:02:11.630
have already pulled out eight people 
from the inferno.

46
00:02:12.088 --> 00:02:14.005
And the operation continues.

47
00:02:14.088 --> 00:02:17.088
From Brooklyn. I'm Kate Bradley.
Channel 12 News.

48
00:02:17.171 --> 00:02:20.171
Wow. None of the other stations 
have anything like that.

49
00:02:20.255 --> 00:02:22.546
Nice footage. Josh.

50
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.088
Don't look at me. It was all Kate.

51
00:02:24.171 --> 00:02:26.380
Ooh. and it's getting a ton of views
on our website.

52
00:02:26.463 --> 00:02:27.380
Nice.

53
00:02:27.463 --> 00:02:30.171
Kate. I just got off the phone 
with our legal department.

54
00:02:30.255 --> 00:02:32.588
Want to guess what they said
about your report from the scene?

55
00:02:32.671 --> 00:02:33.630
Bravo?

56
00:02:34.463 --> 00:02:36.421
-Good job?
-Try reckless and dangerous.

57
00:02:36.505 --> 00:02:38.171
Our insurance
doesn't cover stunts like that.

58
00:02:38.255 --> 00:02:40.838
Stunts?
I mean. I call that being a reporter.

59
00:02:40.921 --> 00:02:41.838
It's got to stop.

60
00:02:41.921 --> 00:02:44.963
Well. they didn't seem to mind 
when I got them that exclusive coverage

61
00:02:45.046 --> 00:02:47.296
from inside the collapsed factory 
in the Bronx.

62
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.255
No. no. you see. actually. I did mind.

63
00:02:49.338 --> 00:02:51.880
Station management are going nuts
with all the risks you're taking.

64
00:02:51.963 --> 00:02:53.713
[scoffs]
Well. they seem to like the ratings.

65
00:02:53.796 --> 00:02:55.755
Knock it off. Kate. You hear me?

66
00:02:56.671 --> 00:02:58.755
-Yeah. loud and clear. boss.
-Thank you.

67
00:02:59.588 --> 00:03:00.421
[sighs]

68
00:03:00.505 --> 00:03:01.713
[horns honking]

69
00:03:01.796 --> 00:03:04.338
-[Kate] So you said 12 people rescued?
-[phone beeps]

70
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:06.546
Can I call you back? Thanks.

71
00:03:09.421 --> 00:03:11.255
Hi. Dad. I saw your text. but I--

72
00:03:11.338 --> 00:03:14.338
[man]  I saw your report
from the warehouse fire. I was worried.

73
00:03:14.421 --> 00:03:16.213
It's not like you to ignore my texts.

74
00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:17.963
I'm not ignoring you. Dad.

75
00:03:18.046 --> 00:03:21.546
It's been a busy day. and I just got 
the fire investigator on the phone--

76
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.130
It's midnight and you're still working?

77
00:03:24.463 --> 00:03:27.130
[Kate]  Dad. I know you're calling me 
from the office.

78
00:03:28.005 --> 00:03:31.005
Well. that's different.
A senator's work is never done.

79
00:03:31.921 --> 00:03:34.838
You know. I wish you'd consider
reporting on politics

80
00:03:34.921 --> 00:03:37.380
instead of chasing fires and car crashes.

81
00:03:37.463 --> 00:03:38.713
It'd be a lot safer.

82
00:03:38.796 --> 00:03:41.755
Safer. sure. but not nearly as exciting.

83
00:03:41.838 --> 00:03:44.338
At least say you'll join me 
for this fundraiser tomorrow.

84
00:03:44.421 --> 00:03:48.088
Do you really need me there?
You know I don't like political events.

85
00:03:48.171 --> 00:03:50.296
Yes. but I also know you love me.

86
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.296
[chuckles]

87
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.255
Come on. do your dad a favor.

88
00:03:53.713 --> 00:03:54.713
The donors love you.

89
00:03:54.796 --> 00:03:56.963
Besides. I haven't seen your face in ages.

90
00:03:57.505 --> 00:04:00.671
- Dad. we FaceTimed yesterday.
-Doesn't count.

91
00:04:01.171 --> 00:04:02.088
[chuckles]

92
00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:05.463
All right. all right.
I will see you at the fundraiser.

93
00:04:05.546 --> 00:04:08.505
Now get out of the office 
and stop worrying about me.

94
00:04:08.588 --> 00:04:11.088
- Okay. Good night.
- Good night.

95
00:04:17.296 --> 00:04:18.463
[horns honking]

96
00:04:21.046 --> 00:04:24.296
Right off the top. we've got
Susan's interview with the mayor.

97
00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.255
You good to go?

98
00:04:25.338 --> 00:04:27.838
His Honorable has pushed it to 3:00 p.m..
but I'll be ready.

99
00:04:27.921 --> 00:04:30.380
Good. Keep digging. Get the story first.

100
00:04:30.463 --> 00:04:31.755
Alex. welcome.

101
00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:33.171
Hi. sorry. Train delay.

102
00:04:33.255 --> 00:04:35.713
Next. we've got that bomb scare
at Newark Liberty.

103
00:04:35.796 --> 00:04:37.838
-Ed. I want you on this one.
-Already there.

104
00:04:37.921 --> 00:04:40.171
David. I covered that train derailment
last March.

105
00:04:40.255 --> 00:04:41.921
I stayed in contact
with some of my sources

106
00:04:42.005 --> 00:04:43.213
at the Department of Transpo.

107
00:04:43.296 --> 00:04:45.296
-Send them to Ed if you think they'd help.
-Great.

108
00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.046
I was thinking
this could be my assignment.

109
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.630
Forget about it. Kate.
Actually. this one's for you.

110
00:04:49.713 --> 00:04:51.630
There was a call from a woman
in the South Bronx

111
00:04:51.713 --> 00:04:53.671
saying she found a bag on her porch.

112
00:04:53.755 --> 00:04:57.588
She found a bag? Why aren't we going 
live to air with this thing right now?

113
00:04:58.088 --> 00:05:02.005
-The bag was full of cash.
-Who does she think it belongs to?

114
00:05:02.088 --> 00:05:04.546
She's convinced it was given to her
by a Good Samaritan.

115
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.046
-Aww.
-Sounds like a sweet story.

116
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.171
You now. this could be a home run 
for Lauren.

117
00:05:09.255 --> 00:05:10.838
She's great on soft news. No offense.

118
00:05:10.921 --> 00:05:12.755
-It's what I do.
-Lauren's on Ribfest.

119
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.046
Okay. Well. I can follow up 
on the warehouse fire.

120
00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.130
The fire's out. 
There's nothing to follow up on.

121
00:05:18.213 --> 00:05:20.921
That's it. people. Get out of here. 
Go find some news.

122
00:05:21.588 --> 00:05:23.838
David. what are you not telling me?

123
00:05:23.921 --> 00:05:26.380
Execs don't want you on any story
that might explode.

124
00:05:26.463 --> 00:05:29.255
implode. burst into flames.
or otherwise end up in an insurance claim.

125
00:05:29.755 --> 00:05:31.921
Consider this a break
from the bummer beat.

126
00:05:32.421 --> 00:05:33.421
For how long?

127
00:05:33.505 --> 00:05:35.963
We'll see. 
For now. you're on the Good Samaritan.

128
00:05:36.255 --> 00:05:37.088
[scoffs]

129
00:05:39.171 --> 00:05:40.421
[Kate] It's barely news.

130
00:05:40.505 --> 00:05:43.130
A woman finds a bag of money.
I mean. what's next?

131
00:05:43.421 --> 00:05:45.838
A charity car wash?
Parent-teacher conference?

132
00:05:45.921 --> 00:05:48.046
David's not gonna keep you
on local interest for long.

133
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.046
-You're one of his best reporters.
-Thanks.

134
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.255
But still. I mean. where's the story?

135
00:05:52.338 --> 00:05:54.171
What? You don't buy
the Good Samaritan angle?

136
00:05:54.255 --> 00:05:57.463
I remain objective always. But no.

137
00:05:58.963 --> 00:05:59.796
[sighs]

138
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.463
[chattering and laughing]

139
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.296
[woman] Over here!

140
00:06:14.296 --> 00:06:15.630
[Kate] There she is. Hi.

141
00:06:16.546 --> 00:06:17.380
You ready?

142
00:06:18.088 --> 00:06:19.463
Please. come this way.

143
00:06:20.796 --> 00:06:21.755
I will let you in.

144
00:06:22.213 --> 00:06:24.421
It came in this bag. just like this.

145
00:06:25.005 --> 00:06:26.880
$100.000.

146
00:06:27.421 --> 00:06:28.588
100.000?

147
00:06:29.755 --> 00:06:30.588
Wow.

148
00:06:30.671 --> 00:06:32.921
And. now. does this mean anything to you?

149
00:06:33.755 --> 00:06:34.588
No.

150
00:06:35.963 --> 00:06:39.296
But I know there is someone out there 
looking over and helping us.

151
00:06:40.463 --> 00:06:41.921
This has been a very hard time.

152
00:06:43.671 --> 00:06:45.963
My husband was laid off last winter.

153
00:06:46.046 --> 00:06:48.005
After that. we were evicted and...

154
00:06:48.838 --> 00:06:49.963
we moved here.

155
00:06:51.046 --> 00:06:53.005
Did it come with a note? Anything?

156
00:06:53.505 --> 00:06:54.338
No note.

157
00:06:54.838 --> 00:06:56.588
But I know why it happened.

158
00:06:58.713 --> 00:06:59.921
[speaking Spanish]

159
00:07:00.588 --> 00:07:01.588
A miracle.

160
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:07.130
Si.  This is why I called you here.
I want everyone to know miracles happen.

161
00:07:10.171 --> 00:07:11.630
You don't believe in miracles.

162
00:07:12.838 --> 00:07:15.171
You cannot see everything with your eyes.

163
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.088
Sometimes...

164
00:07:17.963 --> 00:07:19.338
you have to look in here.

165
00:07:19.421 --> 00:07:22.963
You know. it may be feel-good filler. 
but it does the trick.

166
00:07:23.046 --> 00:07:26.671
Thanks. We should upload this segment.
though. We go live in 20.

167
00:07:27.463 --> 00:07:29.463
You still think it's drug money.
don't you?

168
00:07:29.921 --> 00:07:32.213
Or maybe a robbery. I don't know.

169
00:07:32.546 --> 00:07:34.088
Look. I just think it's hard to believe

170
00:07:34.171 --> 00:07:38.130
that there's somebody out there doing good
deeds and expecting nothing in return.

171
00:07:38.213 --> 00:07:39.671
I don't know. That's kind of cynical.

172
00:07:39.755 --> 00:07:42.005
-I'm sure it happens all the time.
-Oh. yeah?

173
00:07:42.088 --> 00:07:44.171
Then why. in all of the time
we've worked together.

174
00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:46.421
have we never reported a story like this?

175
00:07:46.505 --> 00:07:48.046
What about that guy last Christmas?

176
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.421
The one that was fixing people's cars
in mall parking lots when they broke down.

177
00:07:51.505 --> 00:07:53.880
That story never aired. 
You know why. right?

178
00:07:53.963 --> 00:07:56.171
-Because he had that weird toupee?
-What? No.

179
00:07:56.546 --> 00:07:58.796
Because the guy disabled the cars
to begin with

180
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.421
while the owners were shopping

181
00:08:00.505 --> 00:08:03.213
and then offered to fix them 
for a small donation.

182
00:08:03.296 --> 00:08:04.463
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

183
00:08:04.546 --> 00:08:05.380
Hmm.

184
00:08:06.713 --> 00:08:07.796
This number eight...

185
00:08:08.505 --> 00:08:10.213
maybe it's a marketing gimmick.

186
00:08:11.046 --> 00:08:13.380
Do you remember that--
that. um. ride-share company

187
00:08:13.463 --> 00:08:15.713
that handed out ten-dollar bills
on Wall Street?

188
00:08:15.796 --> 00:08:16.630
Sure.

189
00:08:16.713 --> 00:08:19.421
That campaign cost them
a quarter million dollars.

190
00:08:19.755 --> 00:08:22.505
Okay. but that campaign
reached 25.000 people.

191
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.921
I mean. what company wants to so badly 
win over Christina Gomez?

192
00:08:26.005 --> 00:08:27.838
Okay. so maybe not that.

193
00:08:28.421 --> 00:08:31.713
All I'm saying is that whoever's
behind this. they have a motive.

194
00:08:32.588 --> 00:08:36.588
I am certain change can happen 
because I am a product of it.

195
00:08:37.005 --> 00:08:39.880
In 1951. my grandfather.

196
00:08:39.963 --> 00:08:41.505
Harish Banerjee.

197
00:08:41.588 --> 00:08:46.255
moved his family and his engineering firm
to New York City.

198
00:08:46.338 --> 00:08:49.630
What was Banerjee Electronics in Calcutta

199
00:08:49.713 --> 00:08:53.088
became Bradley Electronics in Queens.

200
00:08:53.796 --> 00:08:56.671
Harish became Harry. 
but he remained the same man.

201
00:08:57.046 --> 00:09:01.255
A man who came here not just to succeed.
but to give back.

202
00:09:02.046 --> 00:09:04.838
In these uncertain times.

203
00:09:05.338 --> 00:09:08.796
it is tempting to be cynical.
to be fearful.

204
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.255
but together.

205
00:09:10.671 --> 00:09:14.130
-we can make change happen.
-[applause]

206
00:09:14.921 --> 00:09:15.838
Thank you.

207
00:09:21.921 --> 00:09:23.713
Inspiring as always. Dad.

208
00:09:24.755 --> 00:09:27.296
But you got dressed 
in the back of your car again. didn't you?

209
00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.296
-You don't miss a thing. do you?
-Uh-uh.

210
00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:33.421
Now. I want you to meet one of my donors.
He's. uh-- he's been asking about you.

211
00:09:33.505 --> 00:09:34.755
Seen you on TV.

212
00:09:34.838 --> 00:09:35.838
Don't tell me.

213
00:09:35.921 --> 00:09:38.546
Uh. he probably wants me to do a story
on his business.

214
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.255
He already has enough publicity.

215
00:09:40.338 --> 00:09:44.046
He was just named Investment Alliance
fund manager of the year.

216
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:46.130
Oh. so it'll be an hour
of me listening to him

217
00:09:46.213 --> 00:09:48.463
boasting about his financial success.

218
00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:52.588
I don't know why I'd talk about my work
when yours is so much more interesting.

219
00:09:52.671 --> 00:09:55.671
[clears throat]
Kate. meet. uh. Jack Hansen.

220
00:09:55.755 --> 00:09:57.046
Hi. Hi. Jack.

221
00:09:57.755 --> 00:09:58.588
Pleasure.

222
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.755
I guess this means 
now I need to ask you about what you do

223
00:10:01.838 --> 00:10:03.338
to prove I didn't prejudge you.

224
00:10:03.421 --> 00:10:06.963
And I'll pretend to be flattered but steer
the conversation back to what you do.

225
00:10:07.046 --> 00:10:09.546
like. uh. your report
on the train derailment.

226
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:12.088
I couldn't believe
that you got that engineer

227
00:10:12.171 --> 00:10:13.838
to admit that he was texting and driving.

228
00:10:13.921 --> 00:10:15.755
Uh. well. he was not a bright man.

229
00:10:15.838 --> 00:10:17.255
[laughing]

230
00:10:17.338 --> 00:10:19.005
I knew you two would get along.

231
00:10:19.588 --> 00:10:21.588
Do you mind
if I leave you in Kate's hands?

232
00:10:21.671 --> 00:10:23.046
Yeah. if it's all right with her.

233
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:24.255
-Sure.
-Thanks. Ashok.

234
00:10:24.755 --> 00:10:25.671
Bye. Dad.

235
00:10:25.755 --> 00:10:29.755
So should we pick out the best spot
to watch the political ritual unfold?

236
00:10:29.838 --> 00:10:33.005
Uh. for me. that would be
the spot closest to the exit.

237
00:10:33.505 --> 00:10:35.588
So no interest in politics?

238
00:10:35.921 --> 00:10:38.463
Your dad wants you to move to Washington.

239
00:10:38.546 --> 00:10:40.880
Oh. I am well aware. but no.

240
00:10:40.963 --> 00:10:42.671
No way am I leaving New York.

241
00:10:42.755 --> 00:10:45.213
And plus. covering politics
is just not my thing.

242
00:10:45.755 --> 00:10:46.588
Why not?

243
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:48.713
Breaking news is more direct.

244
00:10:48.796 --> 00:10:51.463
It's more honest. At least when people
lie. or cheat. or steal...

245
00:10:51.546 --> 00:10:52.380
[phone chimes]

246
00:10:52.463 --> 00:10:53.880
...they're doing it out in the open.

247
00:10:53.963 --> 00:10:56.463
-No time to make up a soundbite. huh?
-Exactly.

248
00:10:58.255 --> 00:10:59.755
Oh. sorry. Uh...

249
00:11:00.546 --> 00:11:03.296
The station just sent me a lead 
on a story I'm working on.

250
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.255
I have to run.

251
00:11:04.338 --> 00:11:07.171
Okay. well. let's exchange numbers.
We could do dinner sometime.

252
00:11:08.088 --> 00:11:11.005
Um. I'm flattered. but I have a rule.

253
00:11:11.088 --> 00:11:14.046
I don't go out with anyone 
in my father's political circle.

254
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:15.005
Why so?

255
00:11:15.796 --> 00:11:19.796
When you are the daughter of a senator.
you never know what people's motives are.

256
00:11:20.213 --> 00:11:22.671
I like to think
my motives are pretty clear.

257
00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.213
Dinner.

258
00:11:24.505 --> 00:11:25.505
Sala Cucina.

259
00:11:25.921 --> 00:11:29.505
Oh. that's a good restaurant.
but sorry. the answer's still no.

260
00:11:29.838 --> 00:11:31.421
It was really nice to meet you.

261
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:36.796
-[sighs]
-Hi. is this Marie Ellis?

262
00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:37.713
[Marie]  Yes.

263
00:11:38.255 --> 00:11:41.338
This is Kate Bradley with Channel 12 News.
You called the station?

264
00:11:41.421 --> 00:11:45.130
[Marie]  I saw your report about the woman 
who found the cash on her doorstep.

265
00:11:45.213 --> 00:11:48.088
-I got the same thing.
- Really? How much cash was it?

266
00:11:48.171 --> 00:11:51.755
$100.000.
In the bag with the tilted number eight.

267
00:11:51.838 --> 00:11:53.088
Okay. where can I meet you?

268
00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:55.421
I'll text you my address.

269
00:11:55.505 --> 00:11:58.213
But if you bring a camera. 
I won't open my door.

270
00:11:58.296 --> 00:12:00.130
Got it. I'm on my way right now.

271
00:12:02.255 --> 00:12:03.171
[Marie] It's real.

272
00:12:04.505 --> 00:12:05.505
Not counterfeit.

273
00:12:06.755 --> 00:12:08.630
I found it in front of our door
this morning.

274
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.630
Same bag and everything.

275
00:12:10.713 --> 00:12:13.796
I thought it might be stolen.
so I took it to the police. but...

276
00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.546
they say it doesn't appear to be.

277
00:12:16.546 --> 00:12:18.338
Who do you think could be behind this?

278
00:12:18.421 --> 00:12:20.796
I don't know.
I'm hoping you might tell me.

279
00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.713
I'm sorry. I have no idea.

280
00:12:24.505 --> 00:12:28.171
Look. I know the woman you interviewed
thinks it's a Good Samaritan.

281
00:12:29.088 --> 00:12:31.838
But we don't exactly need the help.

282
00:12:33.255 --> 00:12:35.838
I'm an oncologist at Parkland Hospital.

283
00:12:36.255 --> 00:12:37.088
Oh.

284
00:12:37.463 --> 00:12:39.796
So what are you planning on doing 
with the money?

285
00:12:40.796 --> 00:12:42.380
Pancreatic cancer research.

286
00:12:42.963 --> 00:12:43.880
All of it?

287
00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:47.921
It's an underfunded field.
$100.000 will go a very long way.

288
00:12:48.963 --> 00:12:51.171
And. sorry. why pancreatic cancer?

289
00:12:52.796 --> 00:12:54.671
It takes people at a very young age.

290
00:12:54.755 --> 00:12:56.963
often before they even get started.

291
00:12:57.046 --> 00:13:00.005
It'll get a lot of years back.
A lot of potential.

292
00:13:00.671 --> 00:13:02.880
This could make a really compelling story.

293
00:13:03.505 --> 00:13:05.671
Would you consider letting me 
interview you on camera?

294
00:13:06.421 --> 00:13:10.171
This could draw a lot of attention 
to this research that you're supporting.

295
00:13:11.171 --> 00:13:13.463
I like to keep my private life private.

296
00:13:14.296 --> 00:13:17.463
but maybe you could mention 
the cause I'm donating to.

297
00:13:18.463 --> 00:13:19.546
Yeah. I'll. um...

298
00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:21.046
I'll do my best.

299
00:13:22.296 --> 00:13:24.005
[horns honking]

300
00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:28.005
Police just issued a warrant on a string
of hold-ups. those bodegas in Queens.

301
00:13:28.088 --> 00:13:29.338
-Ed. that's you.
-Cool.

302
00:13:29.588 --> 00:13:31.380
News conference at ten
to detail the manhunt.

303
00:13:31.463 --> 00:13:32.338
Got it.

304
00:13:32.421 --> 00:13:34.921
Kate. thanks for coming. 
I've got a good one for you.

305
00:13:35.005 --> 00:13:37.546
City Hall just yanked the permits
on that new high-rise in SoHo.

306
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:39.421
-What?
-[man] They already broke ground.

307
00:13:39.505 --> 00:13:40.755
The whole block is a pit.

308
00:13:40.838 --> 00:13:43.463
Well. something's going on.
Kate. grab Josh and get me some footage.

309
00:13:43.546 --> 00:13:45.505
Actually. I wanna stay
on the Good Samaritan story.

310
00:13:45.588 --> 00:13:46.421
Yeah. that's funny.

311
00:13:46.505 --> 00:13:48.630
-Susan. I want you to--
-No. I'm serious.

312
00:13:48.713 --> 00:13:50.463
A second woman called me last night.

313
00:13:50.546 --> 00:13:52.963
She also found a bag of money 
on her porch.

314
00:13:53.046 --> 00:13:53.880
[Ed] A hundred grand?

315
00:13:53.963 --> 00:13:56.713
Yeah. Same amount. same bag.
same number eight on the bag.

316
00:13:56.796 --> 00:13:59.421
-Does she know who it's from?
-[Kate] No clue whatsoever.

317
00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:00.921
And she doesn't even need the money.

318
00:14:01.005 --> 00:14:04.255
You guys. she's a doctor.
She lives in a palace in Fort Greene.

319
00:14:04.338 --> 00:14:06.213
She's donating it to cancer research.

320
00:14:06.296 --> 00:14:07.671
-All of it?
-Yeah.

321
00:14:07.755 --> 00:14:08.796
You get the interview?

322
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.671
She doesn't want to appear on camera.

323
00:14:10.755 --> 00:14:12.671
-She wants to remain anonymous.
-[sighs]

324
00:14:12.755 --> 00:14:16.421
Come on! Two identical bags of cash?
David. you don't think that's strange?

325
00:14:16.505 --> 00:14:18.255
Yeah. but your second subject 
just clammed up

326
00:14:18.338 --> 00:14:20.171
and "something seems strange" is not news.

327
00:14:20.255 --> 00:14:21.380
But there is a story here.

328
00:14:21.463 --> 00:14:25.088
Maybe. but I can't go to air 
without some on-the-record information.

329
00:14:25.171 --> 00:14:26.005
Kate...

330
00:14:26.338 --> 00:14:27.880
Hi. We just received a phone call

331
00:14:27.963 --> 00:14:30.046
from a Jesse Durham
on the Upper West Side.

332
00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:33.421
He said he found a bag of cash.
just like in your report. and...

333
00:14:33.713 --> 00:14:35.255
he caught the guy on camera.

334
00:14:35.671 --> 00:14:39.088
He left the bag here.
in front of my apartment door.

335
00:14:39.505 --> 00:14:42.380
Caught him on the security camera 
right here in the lobby.

336
00:14:42.755 --> 00:14:44.838
$100.000 is a lot of money.

337
00:14:44.921 --> 00:14:47.130
How will a gift like this 
change your life?

338
00:14:47.213 --> 00:14:48.338
A lot.

339
00:14:48.421 --> 00:14:52.005
I hurt my back a while ago.
It laid me up for. like. three months.

340
00:14:52.088 --> 00:14:56.380
I'm back on my feet now. but it ate 
into my savings and then some.

341
00:14:56.921 --> 00:14:59.046
Can you think of anyone 
that would have wanted to help?

342
00:15:00.421 --> 00:15:03.338
That's the thing.
I never told anyone I needed the money.

343
00:15:03.421 --> 00:15:06.380
-[Kate] How do you plan to spend it?
-I'm gonna pay off my debts.

344
00:15:06.463 --> 00:15:09.671
build my savings back up 
to where they were before the accident.

345
00:15:10.046 --> 00:15:11.671
and whatever's left. I'm...

346
00:15:12.296 --> 00:15:14.671
I'm gonna give to the food bank
around the corner.

347
00:15:14.755 --> 00:15:16.505
They were a real help to me when...

348
00:15:16.838 --> 00:15:18.046
when things got tough.

349
00:15:18.588 --> 00:15:20.213
Will you leave it on their doorstep?

350
00:15:20.296 --> 00:15:23.546
[chuckles] No. I think 
I'm gonna write them a check.

351
00:15:24.296 --> 00:15:27.213
Security cameras 
at this Upper West Side building

352
00:15:27.296 --> 00:15:30.171
captured a glimpse 
of the mysterious donor today

353
00:15:30.255 --> 00:15:33.130
when he dropped a third bag 
to carpenter Jesse Durham.

354
00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:37.505
just hours after a second bag was left
at the home of a Brooklyn resident.

355
00:15:37.588 --> 00:15:39.463
who wishes to remain anonymous.

356
00:15:39.838 --> 00:15:44.463
Who is this Good Samaritan 
who has now given away $300.000?

357
00:15:44.838 --> 00:15:46.713
From the footage.
we can tell that he is male.

358
00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.088
approximately six feet tall.

359
00:15:49.505 --> 00:15:51.421
but the rest remains a mystery.

360
00:15:52.046 --> 00:15:54.255
Kate Bradley. Channel 12 News.

361
00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.088
[man]  Channel 12 welcomes your comments
on Good Sam.

362
00:15:58.171 --> 00:16:01.838
Check out our website 
at Channel12NewsNewYork.com

363
00:16:02.421 --> 00:16:03.796
Someone we should know about?

364
00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.046
Uh. not particularly. no.

365
00:16:06.671 --> 00:16:08.296
Okay. Nice story tonight.

366
00:16:08.713 --> 00:16:09.588
Well. thanks.

367
00:16:10.005 --> 00:16:13.046
But you had more questions than answers.
and that's not gonna hold up.

368
00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:15.380
You need to get some solid info 
on Good Sam.

369
00:16:15.463 --> 00:16:17.755
Okay. I will have something solid for you 
by tomorrow.

370
00:16:17.838 --> 00:16:18.671
If you get stuck--

371
00:16:18.755 --> 00:16:20.921
-No. I'm not stuck.
-If you get stuck.

372
00:16:21.005 --> 00:16:22.130
we can bring Susan in.

373
00:16:23.213 --> 00:16:25.005
Good Sam is my story. David.

374
00:16:25.088 --> 00:16:26.421
She might be able to help.

375
00:16:26.671 --> 00:16:28.380
I don't need help. I got this.

376
00:16:52.213 --> 00:16:53.338
[David] You're in early.

377
00:16:53.755 --> 00:16:54.588
Did you sleep here?

378
00:16:54.921 --> 00:16:57.296
I napped a little. I was working.

379
00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:00.213
Listen. I think I found 
a really solid lead on Good Sam.

380
00:17:00.296 --> 00:17:01.130
I'm listening.

381
00:17:01.213 --> 00:17:04.380
The people who found the money 
live all over the city. right?

382
00:17:04.463 --> 00:17:07.838
They have completely different backgrounds
and-- and professions.

383
00:17:07.921 --> 00:17:09.046
It seems totally random.

384
00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:10.880
In what world is that a solid lead?

385
00:17:10.963 --> 00:17:13.921
It seems random. but then there's this.

386
00:17:14.005 --> 00:17:15.671
The second and third recipients.

387
00:17:15.755 --> 00:17:17.546
Marie Ellis and Jesse Durham.

388
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:20.088
both found their homes 
through Inniswell Properties.

389
00:17:20.171 --> 00:17:21.338
Inniswell's a big firm.

390
00:17:21.588 --> 00:17:24.213
Big enough that it could be a coincidence.

391
00:17:24.296 --> 00:17:26.088
but then. this.

392
00:17:27.005 --> 00:17:30.838
Both Marie and Jesse worked 
with the same Realtor. Patrick Hayes.

393
00:17:30.921 --> 00:17:31.963
He's a partner at the firm.

394
00:17:32.046 --> 00:17:33.921
[David] So all this
is some big publicity stunt?

395
00:17:34.005 --> 00:17:35.171
Get a load of this.

396
00:17:35.755 --> 00:17:38.838
Back in May. Inniswell announced 
that they were going public.

397
00:17:38.921 --> 00:17:40.880
Patrick led the press conference.

398
00:17:40.963 --> 00:17:44.171
Everything fell apart 
due to an internal crisis.

399
00:17:44.255 --> 00:17:48.046
Just last week. the financial trades
announced that the IPO is back on.

400
00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:49.046
Interesting.

401
00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:51.505
Now. if you consider 
the amount of publicity

402
00:17:51.588 --> 00:17:55.171
that Inniswell would get as Good Sam.
300 grand's a bargain.

403
00:17:55.255 --> 00:17:56.838
What about Hayes? Can he confirm or deny?

404
00:17:56.921 --> 00:17:59.296
I haven't been able 
to get in touch with him yet.

405
00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:00.546
[David] So what's your plan?

406
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.463
I'm gonna show up at his office 
and ask Patrick Hayes

407
00:18:03.546 --> 00:18:06.296
to admit his agenda
for giving all this money away.

408
00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:09.796
Do that and we'll promote Good Sam 
as a follow-up on our noon cast.

409
00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.296
-Thanks. David.
-Good work.

410
00:18:17.088 --> 00:18:19.546
Hi. I'm Kate Bradley with Channel 12 News.

411
00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:22.755
I'd like to speak with one 
of your partners. Patrick Hayes. Is he in?

412
00:18:23.088 --> 00:18:24.213
Can I ask what this is about?

413
00:18:24.796 --> 00:18:27.505
I'd rather tell him directly.
Do you know when he'll be in?

414
00:18:27.588 --> 00:18:28.671
I'm not sure.

415
00:18:29.421 --> 00:18:33.171
Is that camera on? You're not gonna
put me on the news. are you?

416
00:18:33.838 --> 00:18:37.130
Well. not if we can talk to Patrick Hayes.
but we've got to run something.

417
00:18:37.838 --> 00:18:40.755
I'm sorry. I'm-- I'm just a temp.
I started on Monday.

418
00:18:40.838 --> 00:18:42.713
All I know is. uh...

419
00:18:42.796 --> 00:18:45.213
I'm supposed to forward his mail.

420
00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:47.921
-Let me go ask.
-Great. Thank you.

421
00:18:52.171 --> 00:18:53.713
[camera shutter clicking]

422
00:19:02.713 --> 00:19:05.005
This is where a partner 
in Inniswell Properties lives?

423
00:19:05.088 --> 00:19:08.338
No kidding. If he's a land baron.
he sure hides it well.

424
00:19:08.421 --> 00:19:09.880
-It should be this one.
-Yeah.

425
00:19:16.338 --> 00:19:19.671
Hi. I'm Kate Bradley. 
We're with Channel 12 News.

426
00:19:20.046 --> 00:19:21.546
Yeah. we met. actually.

427
00:19:22.671 --> 00:19:24.713
The other day 
at the Brooklyn warehouse fire.

428
00:19:26.588 --> 00:19:27.421
That was you?

429
00:19:27.796 --> 00:19:28.630
[chuckles]

430
00:19:28.963 --> 00:19:32.213
Hey. You took a big risk
for a shot on the 11 o'clock news.

431
00:19:32.296 --> 00:19:34.380
Well. that's what we do. right?

432
00:19:34.463 --> 00:19:36.838
Both got to get close to the fire
to do our jobs.

433
00:19:36.921 --> 00:19:39.463
Yeah. except one of us
had state-of-the-art fire protection

434
00:19:39.546 --> 00:19:41.171
and the other one had a camera.

435
00:19:41.255 --> 00:19:42.880
Uh. my camera. actually.

436
00:19:43.463 --> 00:19:45.213
Okay. but did you see the footage?

437
00:19:45.588 --> 00:19:49.338
I mean. you pulled three people out 
in ten minutes. It was unbelievable.

438
00:19:50.338 --> 00:19:52.338
Look. if you're here for an interview 
or something.

439
00:19:52.421 --> 00:19:54.546
you've gotta go through
the FDNY press office.

440
00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.713
Actually. we're here about Good Sam.

441
00:19:57.713 --> 00:19:58.630
Good who?

442
00:19:59.546 --> 00:20:01.546
In the last 24 hours.

443
00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:05.130
three people have each found
100 grand in cash on their doorsteps.

444
00:20:05.755 --> 00:20:08.171
We're looking for the anonymous 
Good Samaritan behind it.

445
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:09.880
Okay. and how can I help?

446
00:20:10.588 --> 00:20:12.005
Well. for starters...

447
00:20:12.588 --> 00:20:13.505
are you Good Sam?

448
00:20:14.838 --> 00:20:15.671
No.

449
00:20:16.046 --> 00:20:19.588
But. uh. I'd like to know why you came
all the way down here to ask me that.

450
00:20:19.671 --> 00:20:22.130
Two of the three people 
who found the money

451
00:20:22.213 --> 00:20:24.005
got their homes
through Inniswell Properties.

452
00:20:25.296 --> 00:20:26.171
Uh...

453
00:20:26.255 --> 00:20:28.338
Yeah. I think you got your wires crossed.

454
00:20:28.755 --> 00:20:31.171
Patrick Hayes used to be a partner
at Inniswell Properties.

455
00:20:31.671 --> 00:20:32.963
I'm his brother. Eric.

456
00:20:34.255 --> 00:20:36.421
Um. wait. He  used  to be a partner?

457
00:20:37.588 --> 00:20:39.005
Yeah. he died five months ago.

458
00:20:40.255 --> 00:20:42.255
I'm so sorry. I-I had no idea.

459
00:20:45.213 --> 00:20:47.005
Well. I'm sorry
I couldn't be of more help.

460
00:20:50.255 --> 00:20:53.296
If you. uh-- if you think of anything. 
you can call me...

461
00:20:54.005 --> 00:20:55.380
-anytime.
-Sure.

462
00:20:58.838 --> 00:21:00.005
Good luck with your story.

463
00:21:00.588 --> 00:21:01.463
Thanks.

464
00:21:06.213 --> 00:21:07.046
What?

465
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:14.921
-[Josh] Never thought I'd see it.
-See what?

466
00:21:15.463 --> 00:21:16.880
You are rock solid

467
00:21:16.963 --> 00:21:19.505
when you're interviewing the police chief 
or the mayor. but...

468
00:21:20.005 --> 00:21:23.046
when you were talking to Eric Hayes...
you were flustered.

469
00:21:23.463 --> 00:21:25.838
I was not flustered. I'm never flustered.

470
00:21:25.921 --> 00:21:27.171
You were pretty flustered.

471
00:21:27.255 --> 00:21:29.171
-[Kate] No.
-Flustered.

472
00:21:29.255 --> 00:21:32.171
-[cell phone vibrates]
-Look at Kate. She is flustered!

473
00:21:33.088 --> 00:21:33.921
Hello?

474
00:21:34.005 --> 00:21:36.755
[man]  Hello. Have I reached 
the talented Kate Bradley?

475
00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:38.880
This is Kate. Who's this?

476
00:21:38.963 --> 00:21:39.963
Jack Hansen.

477
00:21:40.838 --> 00:21:42.088
How are you this morning?

478
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:46.463
I see you didn't let the fact 
that I never gave you my number stop you.

479
00:21:46.546 --> 00:21:49.296
Oh. I have top secret ways
to get that confidential information.

480
00:21:50.421 --> 00:21:51.421
Mm-hm.

481
00:21:51.505 --> 00:21:54.505
Is it someone by the name 
of Senator Ashok Bradley?

482
00:21:55.088 --> 00:21:57.421
Any chance you might reconsider
having dinner with me?

483
00:21:57.505 --> 00:21:59.963
Or shall I tell my skywriter pilot

484
00:22:00.046 --> 00:22:03.755
to fly over Channel 12 
and write out an invitation?

485
00:22:03.838 --> 00:22:09.505
Hmm. an invitation by skywriter
would be original but. uh. overboard.

486
00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.463
I've been thinking about your rule

487
00:22:11.546 --> 00:22:15.338
of not dating anyone
in your father's political circle.

488
00:22:15.421 --> 00:22:18.130
and... does it extend to donors?

489
00:22:18.213 --> 00:22:20.963
'Cause. I mean.
I'm just a lowly hedge fund manager

490
00:22:21.046 --> 00:22:22.463
trying to take you out for dinner.

491
00:22:22.546 --> 00:22:23.463
Mmm.

492
00:22:24.213 --> 00:22:25.130
Um...

493
00:22:25.546 --> 00:22:27.130
Sure. Why not?

494
00:22:27.463 --> 00:22:28.338
Great.

495
00:22:28.796 --> 00:22:31.088
I'll swing by the station.
pick you up at seven?

496
00:22:31.171 --> 00:22:32.921
Seven it is. See you then.

497
00:22:33.005 --> 00:22:34.338
Sounds good.   See you then.

498
00:22:36.588 --> 00:22:37.713
There. See?

499
00:22:38.296 --> 00:22:39.755
I'm going out with someone else.

500
00:22:39.838 --> 00:22:41.588
Yeah. but you weren't
the least bit flustered.

501
00:22:42.213 --> 00:22:43.963
-Whatever.
-[cell phone chimes and vibrates]

502
00:22:44.421 --> 00:22:46.796
Oh. We gotta go to Staten Island.

503
00:22:47.671 --> 00:22:48.505
Why?

504
00:22:49.088 --> 00:22:51.171
[Kate] David's orders. via text.

505
00:22:51.713 --> 00:22:52.671
David can text?

506
00:22:52.755 --> 00:22:54.005
He's learning.

507
00:22:54.463 --> 00:22:57.213
"Goop Wam made another muddy drop."

508
00:22:58.421 --> 00:23:00.963
-Another one?
-Same bag. same cash.

509
00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:03.005
And this time. he left a note.

510
00:23:04.505 --> 00:23:06.213
Okay. [exhales]

511
00:23:08.713 --> 00:23:11.838
Good Sam is the man that everyone
in New York is talking about.

512
00:23:11.921 --> 00:23:14.713
and yet his identity remains a mystery.

513
00:23:14.796 --> 00:23:17.005
Kate Bradley reports from Staten Island.

514
00:23:17.088 --> 00:23:21.380
where a paralegal found $100.000 today.
along with a note.

515
00:23:21.713 --> 00:23:22.713
What did the note say?

516
00:23:24.838 --> 00:23:26.755
"This is for you to go to law school."

517
00:23:27.546 --> 00:23:28.963
Do you want to go to law school?

518
00:23:29.963 --> 00:23:31.713
It's been my dream my whole life.

519
00:23:32.838 --> 00:23:34.713
I've been a paralegal for ten years.

520
00:23:35.505 --> 00:23:37.171
[woman]
You hang around lawyers that long...

521
00:23:38.046 --> 00:23:40.338
you kind of wonder 
what it'd be like to be the boss.

522
00:23:40.588 --> 00:23:42.296
[Kate]  The recipient says
she was accepted...

523
00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:43.796
-You look nice.
-Thanks.

524
00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.880
-Where are you going?
-Um. just out.

525
00:23:45.963 --> 00:23:47.546
-Okay. Good night.
-Good night.

526
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:50.421
[Kate]  We asked who might have heard
about this life-long dream.

527
00:23:50.921 --> 00:23:52.463
Just about everyone I know.

528
00:23:53.463 --> 00:23:55.421
But no one has $100.000 to give me.

529
00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.088
[Susan]  Thank you. Kate.

530
00:23:58.588 --> 00:24:00.421
My dad still doesn't understand

531
00:24:00.505 --> 00:24:03.880
why I chose to go to journalism school
instead of law school like he did.

532
00:24:03.963 --> 00:24:04.921
Yeah. but...

533
00:24:05.421 --> 00:24:08.130
I know that your dad is very proud of you.

534
00:24:08.755 --> 00:24:11.796
He's slowly warming up 
to this whole reporter thing.

535
00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.421
He likes the Good Sam stories I'm doing.

536
00:24:13.963 --> 00:24:18.213
Wow. Everywhere I go.
I keep hearing about this Good Sam.

537
00:24:18.296 --> 00:24:21.213
Oh. I can't believe 
the numbers we're getting

538
00:24:21.296 --> 00:24:23.088
on a story about someone doing good.

539
00:24:23.921 --> 00:24:26.046
-Really?
-Yeah. It's crazy.

540
00:24:27.505 --> 00:24:30.546
Speaking of good.
this is what they're famous for here.

541
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:31.713
Okay.

542
00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:36.130
-Mmm.
-Ah?

543
00:24:36.421 --> 00:24:37.255
Mmm.

544
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:42.005
I'm not usually a dessert fan. 
but. wow. that is incredible.

545
00:24:42.088 --> 00:24:45.921
See? And you never would have known 
if you hadn't bent your dating rule.

546
00:24:47.088 --> 00:24:48.005
I'm glad you did.

547
00:24:49.546 --> 00:24:52.171
You know. I had almost forgotten 
that I met you at that fundraiser.

548
00:24:53.005 --> 00:24:55.130
I hope it's not just
the peach cobbler speaking.

549
00:24:55.213 --> 00:24:56.255
[laughs]

550
00:24:56.338 --> 00:24:58.421
It is not just the peach cobbler speaking.

551
00:24:58.505 --> 00:25:02.171
But if you thought I was gonna share this
with you. you're sadly mistaken.

552
00:25:03.005 --> 00:25:04.296
So I'm gonna order my own now?

553
00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:05.713
-Yeah. I think that's best.
-Okay.

554
00:25:05.796 --> 00:25:06.671
[laughs]

555
00:25:07.963 --> 00:25:10.505
Interest in Good Sam continues to grow.

556
00:25:10.588 --> 00:25:14.546
with all five boroughs abuzz 
with these random acts of generosity.

557
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:16.088
who could be behind them.

558
00:25:16.171 --> 00:25:19.088
and when and where 
the next bag of money might appear.

559
00:25:19.171 --> 00:25:22.588
If I had $100.000. 
I'd move out of my parents' house

560
00:25:22.671 --> 00:25:24.546
and get a sweet apartment downtown.

561
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:26.880
If I had $100.000.

562
00:25:26.963 --> 00:25:29.838
I would pay off mine
and my daughter's student loans.

563
00:25:30.213 --> 00:25:32.630
and then I'd take us both to Hawaii.

564
00:25:32.713 --> 00:25:36.630
We received thousands
of phone calls. emails. and videos

565
00:25:36.713 --> 00:25:38.296
in response to our reporting.

566
00:25:38.755 --> 00:25:42.005
like this one from Sylvia. 
one of our youngest viewers.

567
00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:46.046
Hi. Good Sam. My name is Sylvia.
I hope you see this.

568
00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:48.005
My mommy is really sick.

569
00:25:48.088 --> 00:25:50.880
and we need your help 
for some medicine she needs.

570
00:25:50.963 --> 00:25:52.796
Could you choose our family next?

571
00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:56.130
Still. there are no leads
on Good Sam's identity.

572
00:25:56.213 --> 00:25:58.880
The question at the top 
of every New Yorker's mind.

573
00:25:58.963 --> 00:26:01.005
Good Sam. who are you?

574
00:26:01.255 --> 00:26:05.088
Any new leads on Good Sam's identity?
Oh. how'd that Realtor thing work out?

575
00:26:05.171 --> 00:26:07.713
Dead end. just like everything else.
We know who he's not.

576
00:26:07.796 --> 00:26:10.796
Yeah. we spoke to a bunch
of charities and foundations.

577
00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:14.588
They all said that no reasonable
non-profit would ever operate this way.

578
00:26:14.671 --> 00:26:17.546
-We even called an FBI profiler.
-Any insights?

579
00:26:18.088 --> 00:26:20.921
Just that we have no idea who Good Sam is.

580
00:26:21.213 --> 00:26:24.963
Look. he might seem like Santa Claus 
or some other benevolent figure.

581
00:26:25.046 --> 00:26:27.130
but the profiler said it's just as likely

582
00:26:27.213 --> 00:26:30.296
that something darker. even dangerous.
is motivating this.

583
00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:32.630
Kate. there's a man here asking for you.

584
00:26:32.713 --> 00:26:34.130
He says he's Good Sam.

585
00:26:34.713 --> 00:26:36.046
What does he look like?

586
00:26:36.588 --> 00:26:38.130
Mid-thirties. maybe six foot-ish.

587
00:26:38.796 --> 00:26:40.505
Matches Jesse Durham's security footage.

588
00:26:41.088 --> 00:26:43.380
Um... yeah. tell him I'll be right there.

589
00:26:45.963 --> 00:26:48.005
So. Tyler. is It?

590
00:26:48.088 --> 00:26:48.921
Good Sam.

591
00:26:49.005 --> 00:26:49.963
Uh-huh.

592
00:26:50.255 --> 00:26:53.338
Uh. tell me how you got all this money
to give away.

593
00:26:53.421 --> 00:26:56.046
I built an app for this little company

594
00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:58.796
and it got sold to a giant company.

595
00:26:58.880 --> 00:26:59.713
Mm-hmm.

596
00:27:00.171 --> 00:27:02.463
And. um. why are you doing all this?

597
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.796
I wanted to do an anonymous 
social experiment for good.

598
00:27:07.213 --> 00:27:09.755
To share my wealth with random strangers.

599
00:27:10.213 --> 00:27:12.171
Isn't that what we should all be doing?

600
00:27:12.463 --> 00:27:13.755
Sure. yeah.

601
00:27:14.421 --> 00:27:17.213
And. um. how did you choose
your recipients?

602
00:27:17.296 --> 00:27:18.546
I wrote some code

603
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:22.505
that would randomly select 
residential addresses in New York City.

604
00:27:22.838 --> 00:27:25.296
Ah. And why this way. though?

605
00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:28.296
You know. leaving $100.000 
on people's doorsteps.

606
00:27:28.796 --> 00:27:31.088
I found it was a creative way to do it.

607
00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:33.505
It is. isn't it?

608
00:27:34.755 --> 00:27:38.588
Are we doing the interview in there.
at the-- the news desk?

609
00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:42.713
-Uh. I need to collect some facts first.
-Because everybody knows I'm him.

610
00:27:42.796 --> 00:27:44.880
I mean.
that's why they're all looking at me.

611
00:27:46.005 --> 00:27:51.338
A few days ago. you left $100.000 
for a woman so she could go to law school.

612
00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:53.421
What was her first name again?

613
00:27:55.088 --> 00:27:55.921
I...

614
00:27:56.005 --> 00:27:58.505
Sorry. I-- I can't remember every detail.

615
00:27:58.588 --> 00:28:00.046
It's okay. Take a moment.

616
00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:02.005
I never mentioned her name 
in any of my reports.

617
00:28:02.088 --> 00:28:03.880
so you'd be the only one to know.

618
00:28:04.296 --> 00:28:06.380
Remind me. what is her name?

619
00:28:07.546 --> 00:28:10.171
Is it. um. Elizabeth Haywood? Is that it?

620
00:28:11.255 --> 00:28:12.671
Yeah. that's it.

621
00:28:12.755 --> 00:28:14.755
That's-- that's her name. I remember now.

622
00:28:14.838 --> 00:28:15.671
Mm-hmm.

623
00:28:16.838 --> 00:28:17.921
Her name was Faith.

624
00:28:18.755 --> 00:28:23.005
How could you forget someone's name 
who you just gave $100.000?

625
00:28:32.963 --> 00:28:36.046
I think this Good Sam is inspiring hope.

626
00:28:36.838 --> 00:28:38.505
Times like these. people need it.

627
00:28:39.213 --> 00:28:41.796
I just keep wondering
what he hopes to gain by all this.

628
00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:45.755
Well. is it possible
that he doesn't expect anything?

629
00:28:46.505 --> 00:28:48.088
That's pretty unlikely.

630
00:28:48.546 --> 00:28:50.421
The problem is he stopped giving.

631
00:28:51.255 --> 00:28:55.755
I mean. biggest story of my career
and it looks like it might be over.

632
00:28:55.838 --> 00:28:57.838
Not one single money drop yesterday.

633
00:28:58.421 --> 00:29:01.171
I have a feeling you'll find a way 
to keep it going.

634
00:29:01.255 --> 00:29:02.130
Thanks. Dad.

635
00:29:03.213 --> 00:29:06.755
Any chance you'll come with me 
to the mayor's house tonight?

636
00:29:07.046 --> 00:29:10.796
I know. I know.
You can't stand political events. but...

637
00:29:11.546 --> 00:29:13.421
you seemed to enjoy the last one.

638
00:29:14.005 --> 00:29:17.380
The last one was not awful. I'll admit.
Yeah.

639
00:29:18.255 --> 00:29:20.671
Could it be because of Jack Hansen?

640
00:29:21.838 --> 00:29:24.546
Our brief conversation wasn't dull.

641
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:28.463
You shouldn't hold the fact 
that he's one of my donors against him.

642
00:29:29.046 --> 00:29:31.005
He's a... He's a smart guy.

643
00:29:31.713 --> 00:29:33.588
A lot of smart guys in New York. Dad.

644
00:29:33.671 --> 00:29:36.296
And ambitious. like you are.

645
00:29:37.755 --> 00:29:40.963
And when you're not busy 
chasing news stories. you...

646
00:29:41.921 --> 00:29:44.005
might like to get to know him better.

647
00:29:45.296 --> 00:29:46.296
We'll see.

648
00:29:46.755 --> 00:29:47.755
Okay?

649
00:29:50.046 --> 00:29:55.296
So. Christina. a week ago. you received
$100.000 from an anonymous donor.

650
00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:57.338
Can you tell us 
what's happened since then?

651
00:29:58.338 --> 00:30:01.963
I would say 
that Good Sam changed my life forever.

652
00:30:02.421 --> 00:30:05.421
And not just because I'm able 
to take care of my family

653
00:30:05.505 --> 00:30:06.755
and buy a few new things.

654
00:30:07.505 --> 00:30:09.463
but because of how he changed me.

655
00:30:09.796 --> 00:30:10.713
And how's that?

656
00:30:12.046 --> 00:30:14.088
He made me see that I could help others.

657
00:30:14.546 --> 00:30:15.921
Like my neighbor. You know?

658
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:18.963
She takes three buses to get to her job.

659
00:30:19.838 --> 00:30:24.713
So. I decided why don't I help her
like Good Sam helped me?

660
00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:28.630
So I went out and I bought her a car.

661
00:30:29.671 --> 00:30:30.755
You bought her a car?

662
00:30:32.046 --> 00:30:33.338
I gave it to her this morning.

663
00:30:33.421 --> 00:30:34.963
Her whole family cried.

664
00:30:36.171 --> 00:30:37.005
And me...

665
00:30:38.171 --> 00:30:41.171
I've never been happier 
about anything I've done.

666
00:30:42.046 --> 00:30:44.588
So getting this gift from Good Sam

667
00:30:44.671 --> 00:30:47.088
-inspired you to give to someone else?
-Mm-hmm.

668
00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:48.505
It's spreading.

669
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:50.921
Like miracles do.

670
00:30:55.171 --> 00:30:58.588
I can't believe Christina used her money
to buy a car for a stranger.

671
00:30:58.671 --> 00:31:01.088
Yeah. And that Marie gave all her stash
to some charity?

672
00:31:01.171 --> 00:31:03.796
Yeah. To pancreatic cancer research
at her hospital.

673
00:31:04.213 --> 00:31:05.171
She texted me.

674
00:31:05.588 --> 00:31:09.296
Apparently. their donations have tripled
since we mentioned it in the news.

675
00:31:10.213 --> 00:31:12.921
It's like Good Sam's generosity 
is contagious.

676
00:31:13.005 --> 00:31:13.880
[cell phone vibrates]

677
00:31:15.463 --> 00:31:16.338
Here we go.

678
00:31:17.255 --> 00:31:19.088
Hey. David. We're headed back right now.

679
00:31:19.171 --> 00:31:21.005
-[David]  Are you still in the Bronx?
-Yeah. why?

680
00:31:21.088 --> 00:31:23.005
Police scanner said
there's a construction worker

681
00:31:23.088 --> 00:31:25.130
dangling off the side 
of the Hope Watson building.

682
00:31:25.213 --> 00:31:26.296
Your van's the closest.

683
00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.255
-Can you be live in three?
-Three minutes?

684
00:31:28.338 --> 00:31:29.880
It's a news van. not a time machine.

685
00:31:29.963 --> 00:31:32.005
I heard that. Josh. 
I want eyeballs on this one.

686
00:31:32.088 --> 00:31:33.963
The fire department can't reach him
with ladders.

687
00:31:34.046 --> 00:31:35.713
so they're gonna send someone
from the roof.

688
00:31:35.796 --> 00:31:39.463
My FDNY source says
it's the rescue one team from station 72.

689
00:31:39.546 --> 00:31:40.796
[Kate]  72? Who's the rescuer?

690
00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:43.630
Uh. Eric Hayes. 
but don't say his name on the air.

691
00:31:44.963 --> 00:31:46.505
[police radio chatter]

692
00:31:56.796 --> 00:31:59.380
-Looks like we're first on the scene.
-[David]  Great.

693
00:31:59.463 --> 00:32:02.213
-Calling my guy at the fire station.
-David. are you seeing this?

694
00:32:03.671 --> 00:32:06.088
We're gonna go live in ten seconds.
Stand by. Kate.

695
00:32:06.505 --> 00:32:08.796
Keep your phone up.
and I'll feed you info as it comes in.

696
00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:11.255
In five. four. three...

697
00:32:12.921 --> 00:32:14.630
[Kate] We are live in the Bronx

698
00:32:14.713 --> 00:32:17.130
where a construction worker
repairing brickwork

699
00:32:17.213 --> 00:32:21.130
now finds himself trapped.
hanging over a hundred feet above ground.

700
00:32:21.505 --> 00:32:23.796
FDNY are attempting a daring rescue here.

701
00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:27.338
sending a lone firefighter
rappelling down the side of the building.

702
00:32:27.421 --> 00:32:28.796
The worker is trying to--

703
00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.005
-[gasps] Oh! Uh...
-[crowd clamoring]

704
00:32:31.755 --> 00:32:32.630
Um...

705
00:32:32.713 --> 00:32:34.005
The worker has slipped.

706
00:32:34.088 --> 00:32:36.838
He is now clinging to the edge 
of his scaffolding.

707
00:32:36.921 --> 00:32:39.755
surely panicked
it won't hold his weight much longer.

708
00:32:41.213 --> 00:32:43.171
Okay. it looks like the rescuer's got him.

709
00:32:44.796 --> 00:32:47.005
He's attaching him to his harness.

710
00:32:48.796 --> 00:32:51.546
And it looks like they're okay.

711
00:32:51.838 --> 00:32:55.421
Another astonishing rescue 
from our heroes at the FDNY.

712
00:32:56.505 --> 00:32:59.171
Big sighs of relief here
in the South Bronx.

713
00:32:59.713 --> 00:33:02.921
Go to a stand-up wrap-up. and get me
an interview for the six o'clock cast.

714
00:33:03.338 --> 00:33:06.796
A perilous situation. a dangerous rescue.

715
00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:11.338
A New York City construction worker 
will go home safe to his family.

716
00:33:11.421 --> 00:33:13.921
thanks to a hero at the FDNY.

717
00:33:14.338 --> 00:33:19.088
Reporting live from the Bronx.
I'm Kate Bradley. Channel 12 News.

718
00:33:21.755 --> 00:33:25.296
-[Josh] He said he doesn't do interviews.
-[Kate] Sit tight till I talk him into it.

719
00:33:28.588 --> 00:33:29.796
Um. excuse me.

720
00:33:30.255 --> 00:33:31.588
I'm looking for Eric Hayes.

721
00:33:31.671 --> 00:33:34.338
Could you let him know that Kate
from Channel 12 News is here. please?

722
00:33:34.421 --> 00:33:35.255
Yeah.

723
00:33:37.338 --> 00:33:39.588
Hayes is in.
but he's not talking to reporters.

724
00:33:39.671 --> 00:33:42.296
-Oh--
-Hey. George. it's all good.

725
00:33:43.171 --> 00:33:44.171
Thanks.

726
00:33:44.505 --> 00:33:45.338
Hi.

727
00:33:46.588 --> 00:33:49.296
-I was at the construction worker rescue.
-Again?

728
00:33:49.921 --> 00:33:52.171
-We've gotta stop meeting like this.
-[laughs]

729
00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:54.546
I'm really glad you're okay.

730
00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:56.588
Yeah. Looks more impressive than it is.

731
00:33:57.046 --> 00:33:58.880
You know. we're pretty well-trained.

732
00:33:59.921 --> 00:34:02.838
Yeah. but it must be hard 
putting your life on the line every day.

733
00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:05.880
I like knowing I'm making things better.
you know.

734
00:34:05.963 --> 00:34:08.588
See. that's exactly 
why you should do an interview.

735
00:34:10.296 --> 00:34:13.880
Look. I cover the bummer beat 
every single day.

736
00:34:13.963 --> 00:34:15.005
Sorry. the what?

737
00:34:15.088 --> 00:34:19.046
You know. um. disaster. murder. violence. 
the things that go wrong.

738
00:34:20.046 --> 00:34:24.171
But today. I watched you take something
that had gone horribly wrong...

739
00:34:24.963 --> 00:34:26.088
and you made it right.

740
00:34:26.963 --> 00:34:28.213
And when that happens...

741
00:34:28.838 --> 00:34:30.088
viewers need to see that.

742
00:34:31.421 --> 00:34:33.630
I feel like you can talk anyone 
into an interview.

743
00:34:35.463 --> 00:34:36.463
Just not today.

744
00:34:36.963 --> 00:34:38.338
You're not gonna convince me.

745
00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:41.463
Well. can I ask why?

746
00:34:43.213 --> 00:34:44.588
You ask a lot of questions.

747
00:34:44.671 --> 00:34:47.088
Well. I am a reporter. 
It's kind of what we do.

748
00:34:48.505 --> 00:34:50.296
We can't all be heroes like you. you know.

749
00:34:50.755 --> 00:34:52.796
I'm not a hero. I'm just doing my job.

750
00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.880
You know. I'm at work right now.
just like you.

751
00:34:55.421 --> 00:34:56.255
Right.

752
00:34:57.546 --> 00:34:59.880
So. really. no interview?

753
00:35:00.338 --> 00:35:01.755
My editor's gonna kill me.

754
00:35:03.338 --> 00:35:04.171
No.

755
00:35:05.546 --> 00:35:07.421
But maybe
we should do this again sometime.

756
00:35:07.505 --> 00:35:09.588
you know. without the emergency vehicles.

757
00:35:13.005 --> 00:35:16.213
-Um. yeah. Yeah. I'd like that.
-[cell phone vibrates and chimes]

758
00:35:16.296 --> 00:35:17.130
Oh. sorry.

759
00:35:17.213 --> 00:35:18.088
Yeah?

760
00:35:18.171 --> 00:35:19.921
Central Park? I got Sunday off.

761
00:35:20.005 --> 00:35:22.796
-Yeah. Yeah. Sunday-- Sunday works great.
-[cell phone chimes]

762
00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.880
I'm so sorry. I have to go.
This is my editor.

763
00:35:24.963 --> 00:35:26.755
Apparently Good Sam
is giving away money again.

764
00:35:28.296 --> 00:35:30.255
-Really? Where?
-Uh...

765
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:32.755
Sunnyside and Lenox Hill.

766
00:35:33.671 --> 00:35:35.546
You really can't be Good Sam. can you?

767
00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:37.296
-I've had eyes on you all day.
-[phone chimes]

768
00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:38.671
Okay. I've got to go.

769
00:35:38.755 --> 00:35:39.921
I'll see you on Sunday.

770
00:35:40.546 --> 00:35:42.338
-[Eric] I'll text you.
-Great.

771
00:35:46.046 --> 00:35:46.880
[man sighing]

772
00:35:48.171 --> 00:35:49.713
Hey. Lauren said that you--

773
00:35:50.296 --> 00:35:51.755
-What's going on?
-[sighs]

774
00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:55.213
We got scooped.

775
00:35:55.838 --> 00:35:57.130
-What?
-Yeah.

776
00:35:58.046 --> 00:36:00.880
That woman in Sunnyside 
who found a hundred grand...

777
00:36:01.463 --> 00:36:03.546
Channel 3 just reported it an hour ago.

778
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:05.338
-You're kidding?
-Mm-hmm.

779
00:36:05.755 --> 00:36:06.921
The family in Lenox Hill...

780
00:36:07.838 --> 00:36:10.046
Channel 9 just reported that
on their six o'clock cast.

781
00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:13.255
-But you sent me to that building rescue.
-No. no.

782
00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:14.880
The news sent you.

783
00:36:14.963 --> 00:36:16.713
And you knocked it out of the park.

784
00:36:17.171 --> 00:36:18.005
Kate...

785
00:36:19.213 --> 00:36:21.630
you were meant for the bummer beat.

786
00:36:21.838 --> 00:36:23.005
That's your thing.

787
00:36:23.088 --> 00:36:26.421
Fires. car crashes. 
Black Friday riots at the mall.

788
00:36:26.505 --> 00:36:28.796
This Good Sam story. not so much.

789
00:36:29.921 --> 00:36:32.338
Is this supposed to be 
some kind of pep talk. 'cause I'm not--

790
00:36:32.421 --> 00:36:35.588
Management wants a bigger name on this.

791
00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:38.421
They want Susan.

792
00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:40.421
On my story?

793
00:36:41.255 --> 00:36:43.213
Come on. Kate. You know how this works.

794
00:36:43.296 --> 00:36:45.963
Every other station 
has their most senior reporter on it.

795
00:36:46.046 --> 00:36:48.046
and Susan does have 15 years' experience--

796
00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:50.421
And an Emmy Award. I know. I get it.

797
00:36:51.213 --> 00:36:53.630
But I'm the one that broke this story.
remember?

798
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:57.338
Please just give me some more time.
I will find Good Sam.

799
00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:58.963
It's a done deal.

800
00:37:00.088 --> 00:37:01.921
Susan's out covering the latest drop-offs.

801
00:37:02.463 --> 00:37:03.296
[scoffs]

802
00:37:04.505 --> 00:37:05.338
[David] Look...

803
00:37:05.963 --> 00:37:07.255
Send her your notes.

804
00:37:07.338 --> 00:37:10.963
I've got you at 10:00 a.m. in Queens.
covering the garbage strike deadline.

805
00:37:11.046 --> 00:37:12.005
Garbage strike.

806
00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:13.713
Wow.

807
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:17.130
It'll be an easy day. You could use it.

808
00:37:17.463 --> 00:37:18.546
Yeah. okay.

809
00:37:20.338 --> 00:37:21.171
Kate...

810
00:37:23.338 --> 00:37:25.005
There's a bigger story out there for you.

811
00:37:27.963 --> 00:37:28.880
Damn it.

812
00:37:30.505 --> 00:37:32.421
Good Sam struck again today.

813
00:37:32.505 --> 00:37:36.421
New York City's mysterious philanthropist 
left $100.000 cash

814
00:37:36.505 --> 00:37:39.130
on a lucky family's doorstep in Queens.

815
00:37:39.213 --> 00:37:42.296
This is the seventh gift 
from New York City's Good Sam.

816
00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:44.796
[Josh] Do we have to listen
to Susan's report on our story?

817
00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.171
-It's killing me.
-I know.

818
00:37:46.255 --> 00:37:48.921
From Hunters Point. Queens.
I'm Susan Andrews...

819
00:37:49.505 --> 00:37:51.338
Wait. Hunters Point?

820
00:37:51.963 --> 00:37:53.088
-What's up?
-Well...

821
00:37:53.796 --> 00:37:57.505
the first four Good Sam gifts 
were left all over the city. but...

822
00:37:58.296 --> 00:37:59.130
Look.

823
00:38:00.046 --> 00:38:01.755
These last three were close together.

824
00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:03.463
David took you off Good Sam.

825
00:38:04.296 --> 00:38:05.671
I'm allowed to be curious.

826
00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:07.505
Consider this my new hobby.

827
00:38:08.005 --> 00:38:09.630
[cell phone chimes and vibrates]

828
00:38:11.755 --> 00:38:12.588
What is it?

829
00:38:14.755 --> 00:38:17.755
Just a text message 
from someone claiming to be Good Sam.

830
00:38:19.213 --> 00:38:20.213
What's it say?

831
00:38:20.296 --> 00:38:22.546
Seriously?
I'm sure it's just another fake.

832
00:38:25.421 --> 00:38:28.463
"Dear Kate. I want to set
the record straight about who I am

833
00:38:28.546 --> 00:38:30.838
and why I've been giving away
substantial sums of money."

834
00:38:30.921 --> 00:38:31.755
Scooch.

835
00:38:34.046 --> 00:38:36.671
"I'm willing to reveal myself to you.
and only you.

836
00:38:36.755 --> 00:38:38.671
a reporter I know I can trust."

837
00:38:41.213 --> 00:38:43.088
I mean. we've heard this before.

838
00:38:43.505 --> 00:38:45.838
Lots of guys out there 
claiming to be Good Sam.

839
00:38:45.921 --> 00:38:47.171
[cell phone chimes]

840
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:51.005
"If you'd like proof that I'm Good Sam.

841
00:38:51.088 --> 00:38:54.296
go see John Baylor
at 225 Watson in Astoria.

842
00:38:55.171 --> 00:38:58.338
I left $100.000 on his front porch 
an hour ago."

843
00:38:59.505 --> 00:39:03.505
Okay. but seriously. I'm sure
reporters all over the city got this text.

844
00:39:03.588 --> 00:39:06.296
Yeah. sounds pretty spammy to me too.

845
00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:10.421
but Watson Street in Astoria
is right near Hunters Point.

846
00:39:10.505 --> 00:39:11.713
-Is it?
-Mm-hmm.

847
00:39:13.255 --> 00:39:14.880
You know what? You're right. It is.

848
00:39:15.671 --> 00:39:17.463
So then. what are we waiting for?

849
00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:20.171
Let's go see 
what's on John Baylor's front porch.

850
00:39:30.005 --> 00:39:32.505
-Which one did you say it is?
-I think it's across there.

851
00:39:33.421 --> 00:39:35.338
[Josh]
So you're really sure about this. huh?

852
00:39:35.421 --> 00:39:37.921
-I just have a hunch.
-A hunch that we're gonna get murdered?

853
00:39:38.005 --> 00:39:40.796
It's broad daylight.
What's the worst that could happen?

854
00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.546
-Famous last words.
-[laughs]

855
00:39:46.296 --> 00:39:47.671
Hi. John Baylor?

856
00:39:47.755 --> 00:39:48.630
Yeah.

857
00:39:48.713 --> 00:39:49.921
I'm from Channel 12 News.

858
00:39:50.005 --> 00:39:51.338
Yeah. I know who you are.

859
00:39:51.671 --> 00:39:54.338
You're the second surprise
to show up on my front porch today.

860
00:39:54.421 --> 00:39:57.880
By that. do you mean you also found
a bag with a stack of cash in it?

861
00:39:57.963 --> 00:39:58.796
Yeah. it was--

862
00:39:59.296 --> 00:40:02.088
Wait. how did you know?
I just got home 20 minutes ago.

863
00:40:02.671 --> 00:40:03.796
We. um...

864
00:40:04.296 --> 00:40:05.838
We're just that good. [laughs]

865
00:40:06.171 --> 00:40:08.380
Would you be willing
to do an interview for the news?

866
00:40:08.838 --> 00:40:10.963
Yeah. but you'll want to talk to Sylvia.

867
00:40:11.046 --> 00:40:12.171
Sylvia!

868
00:40:12.255 --> 00:40:13.838
She's the reason why Good Sam chose us.

869
00:40:14.713 --> 00:40:15.838
-Honey.
-Hi.

870
00:40:15.921 --> 00:40:17.255
Hi. how are you?

871
00:40:17.338 --> 00:40:18.255
I'm good. And you?

872
00:40:18.338 --> 00:40:20.130
-Good. thanks.
-Would you guys like to come in?

873
00:40:20.213 --> 00:40:21.171
Oh. yeah. thank you.

874
00:40:21.255 --> 00:40:22.380
[John] Right this way.

875
00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:26.005
[John]  My wife is really sick.

876
00:40:26.088 --> 00:40:29.338
There's a treatment.
but. um. our insurance doesn't cover it.

877
00:40:29.421 --> 00:40:34.213
So. my daughter. she said.
"Daddy. can we make a video for Good Sam?"

878
00:40:34.921 --> 00:40:38.546
And Sylvia. why did you decide
you wanted to send a message to Good Sam?

879
00:40:39.088 --> 00:40:41.005
[Sylvia]  I wanted him to help my mommy.

880
00:40:41.088 --> 00:40:44.338
[John]  Then I made a video on my phone.
and we posted it on the Channel 12 site.

881
00:40:44.421 --> 00:40:46.505
Yeah. and I was on the news just like you.

882
00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:48.713
[Kate]  That's right. You were.

883
00:40:49.171 --> 00:40:52.755
If Good Sam were watching right now.
what would you like to say to him?

884
00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:57.130
Good Sam...

885
00:40:59.296 --> 00:41:01.005
you're giving us back some hope...

886
00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:03.796
some plans for our future. when...

887
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:06.546
we really thought we were out of both.

888
00:41:08.671 --> 00:41:09.755
Thank you.

889
00:41:09.838 --> 00:41:11.171
Thank you. Good Sam.

890
00:41:14.713 --> 00:41:18.005
We had to make sure the lead was legit
before we brought it to you.

891
00:41:18.088 --> 00:41:20.380
You're gonna run it. right?
I mean. that kid. Like. come on.

892
00:41:21.755 --> 00:41:24.046
It's good. all right? It's good.

893
00:41:24.421 --> 00:41:25.755
But this is Susan's story.

894
00:41:25.838 --> 00:41:28.171
and this is not gonna go over well
with station management.

895
00:41:28.255 --> 00:41:32.046
David. we are the only station
that has this story. for now.

896
00:41:32.796 --> 00:41:34.255
All right. fine. I'll run it.

897
00:41:34.713 --> 00:41:37.213
But in case I wasn't clear before.

898
00:41:37.296 --> 00:41:39.463
you get any more leads.
you bring them to her.

899
00:41:39.546 --> 00:41:41.838
-Okay. but what if Good Sam doesn't--
-[David] Kate. Kate...

900
00:41:41.921 --> 00:41:45.088
Kate. please. just--
just do what I ask you. For once?

901
00:41:49.463 --> 00:41:50.671
What are you looking at?

902
00:41:54.588 --> 00:41:55.463
He's fun.

903
00:41:56.796 --> 00:41:57.630
[door closes]

904
00:41:57.713 --> 00:41:59.588
-It was good.
-It was good. It was very good.

905
00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:08.921
My dad and I actually raced a boat 
here once. We took seventh place.

906
00:42:09.005 --> 00:42:10.880
No kidding. I probably saw you there.

907
00:42:11.296 --> 00:42:14.880
When my brother and I weren't out sailing
with my dad. we were here racing boats.

908
00:42:15.671 --> 00:42:18.463
We built our own models every winter 
to race the next summer.

909
00:42:18.546 --> 00:42:20.630
-Wait. you built them?
-Yeah.

910
00:42:21.171 --> 00:42:22.046
Fancy.

911
00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:23.255
Do you still sail?

912
00:42:23.338 --> 00:42:24.796
Ah. no. not anymore.

913
00:42:26.421 --> 00:42:28.463
Um. so. tell me about kid Eric.

914
00:42:28.546 --> 00:42:32.171
Was he as obsessed with fire trucks 
as he was boats?

915
00:42:32.255 --> 00:42:34.921
Well. yeah. Every kid dreams
of being a firefighter.

916
00:42:35.005 --> 00:42:37.255
I'm just one of the lucky grown-ups
who got to be.

917
00:42:38.171 --> 00:42:40.505
I'm not sure everyone 
would describe a job

918
00:42:40.588 --> 00:42:44.213
where you have to risk your life daily 
to save strangers as "lucky."

919
00:42:45.296 --> 00:42:47.296
All right. Maybe not lucky. then.

920
00:42:47.838 --> 00:42:51.171
Useful... works.
I like knowing that I'm useful.

921
00:42:51.255 --> 00:42:52.088
[Kate] Hmm.

922
00:42:52.338 --> 00:42:54.296
That and the ability to cook at work.

923
00:42:55.046 --> 00:42:57.255
Kid Eric also loved his toy kitchen.

924
00:42:57.338 --> 00:42:58.713
-Oh. really?
-Yeah.

925
00:42:58.796 --> 00:42:59.630
Nice.

926
00:43:00.213 --> 00:43:04.088
I mean. if you're free sometime this week.
I'd love to cook you dinner.

927
00:43:04.755 --> 00:43:07.630
A home-cooked meal?
I will not say no to that.

928
00:43:07.713 --> 00:43:09.338
-[cell phone chimes]
-Ooh. sorry.

929
00:43:11.921 --> 00:43:12.921
Everything okay?

930
00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:16.380
Yeah. sorry.
Um. it's just another text from Good Sam.

931
00:43:16.963 --> 00:43:17.921
Another text?

932
00:43:18.588 --> 00:43:21.171
Yeah. he texted me yesterday
with an address

933
00:43:21.255 --> 00:43:23.796
for the money that he left
for a family in Astoria.

934
00:43:24.213 --> 00:43:25.338
You didn't go. did you?

935
00:43:25.421 --> 00:43:28.713
Josh and I went. And the lead panned out.
The money was there and everything.

936
00:43:30.338 --> 00:43:31.505
What does this one say?

937
00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:33.796
"Uh. now that you know I'm Good Sam.

938
00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:38.505
meet me at nine tonight on level 5A 
of the parking lot at Center and White.

939
00:43:38.588 --> 00:43:41.171
Come alone and don't bring cameras."

940
00:43:41.255 --> 00:43:44.421
Why would he want a reporter 
to come alone without cameras?

941
00:43:44.505 --> 00:43:48.421
Oh. I have met sources 
in some pretty sketchy places. trust me.

942
00:43:48.838 --> 00:43:51.296
Yeah. but still. 
somebody who gives away this kind of money

943
00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:53.213
would either want to keep it
completely quiet

944
00:43:53.296 --> 00:43:55.796
or meet you someplace safe 
for a proper interview.

945
00:43:56.588 --> 00:43:59.713
I-I don't know. I don't trust this guy.
I wouldn't go if I were you.

946
00:44:00.296 --> 00:44:03.421
But he's my story.
I have to know who he is.

947
00:44:03.505 --> 00:44:05.088
And plus. he's changing things.

948
00:44:05.171 --> 00:44:07.630
I mean. he's making people
want to help others.

949
00:44:10.088 --> 00:44:13.588
All right. If you insist 
on meeting this Good Sam...

950
00:44:14.421 --> 00:44:15.630
at least let me come with you.

951
00:44:16.755 --> 00:44:18.588
Thanks. but I'll be fine.

952
00:44:19.338 --> 00:44:20.546
Come on. let me do this.

953
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:23.505
He won't know. but I'll be there.
making sure you're safe.

954
00:44:27.921 --> 00:44:28.921
Okay.

955
00:44:29.255 --> 00:44:30.088
Thanks.

956
00:44:33.171 --> 00:44:34.671
[tires squeal in the distance]

957
00:44:35.963 --> 00:44:36.838
[car door closes]

958
00:44:43.505 --> 00:44:44.338

959
00:44:47.088 --> 00:44:48.963
[tires squeal in the distance]

960
00:44:52.088 --> 00:44:54.046
[people chattering]

961
00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:58.796
[cell phone vibrates]

962
00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:02.921
-[Eric]  You all right?
-[sighs]

963
00:45:03.005 --> 00:45:03.838
Hey.

964
00:45:04.213 --> 00:45:05.046
[Eric]  I'm here.

965
00:45:05.546 --> 00:45:08.380
I haven't taken my eyes
off you for the past ten minutes.

966
00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:11.046
Um. I'm really glad you're here.

967
00:45:11.588 --> 00:45:12.713
wherever that is.

968
00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:17.088
Look. don't worry. Kate.
I won't let anything happen to you.

969
00:45:17.838 --> 00:45:18.671
Thanks.

970
00:45:20.255 --> 00:45:21.963
Uh... he's late.

971
00:45:22.505 --> 00:45:24.463
I'm worried he's not gonna show at all.

972
00:45:27.338 --> 00:45:30.046
-Oh. hey. I think that's him. I gotta go.
- Okay.

973
00:45:41.088 --> 00:45:41.921
Jack?

974
00:45:44.338 --> 00:45:45.213
Good Sam.

975
00:45:46.296 --> 00:45:48.880
-Sorry I'm late.
-Wait. you're Good Sam?

976
00:45:49.921 --> 00:45:52.005
Why didn't you just come out and tell me?

977
00:45:52.088 --> 00:45:53.005
Uh...

978
00:45:53.505 --> 00:45:57.213
I can-- I can explain everything.
just not here.

979
00:45:57.671 --> 00:45:59.671
-Can we go talk somewhere else?
-Sure.

980
00:45:59.755 --> 00:46:02.421
-Hey! Is everything okay?
-What the hell do you think you're doing?

981
00:46:02.505 --> 00:46:04.963
[Kate] Oh. it's okay.
Jack. this is Eric Hayes.

982
00:46:05.046 --> 00:46:06.421
Kate. I asked you to come alone.

983
00:46:06.921 --> 00:46:07.796
Are you Good Sam?

984
00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:10.630
All you need to know
is that she's completely safe with me.

985
00:46:10.713 --> 00:46:14.338
It's okay. Jack's a friend of my dad's.
I know him.

986
00:46:14.921 --> 00:46:15.755
[horn honks]

987
00:46:15.963 --> 00:46:18.755
All right. we gotta go.
We're blocking this guy. so...

988
00:46:18.838 --> 00:46:19.671
I'll call you.

989
00:46:19.755 --> 00:46:20.796
[horn honks]

990
00:46:36.546 --> 00:46:38.630
Eight's always been my lucky number.

991
00:46:38.713 --> 00:46:42.796
and on the eighth of this month.
I made $800.000 on an investment.

992
00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:44.671
Even I wasn't expecting it.

993
00:46:44.755 --> 00:46:47.463
So I figured if it just fell into my lap.

994
00:46:47.546 --> 00:46:48.963
why not someone else's?

995
00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:52.130
And how did you choose the people 
you wanted to help?

996
00:46:52.213 --> 00:46:53.713
Like Christina Gomez.

997
00:46:53.796 --> 00:46:55.463
I just kept my ears open.

998
00:46:55.546 --> 00:46:57.546
My assistant goes to church
with Christina.

999
00:46:57.630 --> 00:47:01.463
and then I saw Sylvia Baylor's video 
on your report.

1000
00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:03.463
But why all the secrecy?

1001
00:47:03.546 --> 00:47:06.213
I mean. why not just give them the money 
and tell them who it's from?

1002
00:47:06.296 --> 00:47:08.296
I didn't want the attention.

1003
00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:11.380
You know. that's why I hired someone
to drop off the money.

1004
00:47:12.046 --> 00:47:14.546
And what about the text messages to me?

1005
00:47:15.296 --> 00:47:16.130
Mmm.

1006
00:47:16.921 --> 00:47:21.213
When I saw that they gave Susan Andrews
your Good Sam story.

1007
00:47:21.296 --> 00:47:23.630
I thought
if I got in touch with you directly.

1008
00:47:23.713 --> 00:47:25.588
then you could get your story back.

1009
00:47:25.671 --> 00:47:28.005
But now everyone's talking about Good Sam.

1010
00:47:28.088 --> 00:47:30.380
and I keep expecting a reporter to...

1011
00:47:30.838 --> 00:47:33.421
burst into my office with a camera crew.

1012
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:36.380
I'm in way over my head here. Kate.

1013
00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:42.755
I'm-- I'm kind of hoping
that you can help me figure out...

1014
00:47:42.838 --> 00:47:43.921
what to do next.

1015
00:47:45.963 --> 00:47:49.421
I think what you should do next 
is try to get ahead of the story.

1016
00:47:50.671 --> 00:47:52.296
You should let me interview you.

1017
00:47:53.338 --> 00:47:54.171
No.

1018
00:47:54.546 --> 00:47:57.505
No. I really don't want to be a story.

1019
00:47:57.588 --> 00:48:01.463
Look. if you go public
and tell people why you did this.

1020
00:48:01.546 --> 00:48:04.296
the story can go back to being
about helping people.

1021
00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:07.713
instead of this mystery 
around who is Good Sam.

1022
00:48:08.671 --> 00:48:09.838
You really think that'll help?

1023
00:48:10.338 --> 00:48:11.171
I do.

1024
00:48:11.713 --> 00:48:13.421
And I think it'll inspire people.

1025
00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:17.963
Okay.

1026
00:48:21.171 --> 00:48:22.005
Okay.

1027
00:48:23.046 --> 00:48:24.838
-I trust you.
-[laughs]

1028
00:48:24.921 --> 00:48:26.046
Okay. great.

1029
00:48:26.921 --> 00:48:28.338
I'll need proof. of course.

1030
00:48:28.421 --> 00:48:31.588
Copies of the statements of the windfall 
you're talking about. withdrawals--

1031
00:48:31.671 --> 00:48:34.046
Yeah. I'll. uh.
email you everything tonight.

1032
00:48:36.046 --> 00:48:36.880
Great.

1033
00:48:41.046 --> 00:48:42.505
I know who Good Sam is.

1034
00:48:43.796 --> 00:48:45.713
-Go on.
-His name is Jack Hansen.

1035
00:48:45.796 --> 00:48:48.796
He runs a hedge fund 
called Northern Lights Investments.

1036
00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:50.921
He made about $800.000 last month

1037
00:48:51.005 --> 00:48:53.213
on a stock deal no one else
thought to make.

1038
00:48:53.505 --> 00:48:55.088
Says he decided to give it away.

1039
00:48:55.171 --> 00:48:56.338
Got any solid evidence?

1040
00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:00.296
He's the one that gave me the tip about
the money being at John Baylor's house.

1041
00:49:01.088 --> 00:49:04.463
-Okay. but does that prove it's him?
-No. but this might.

1042
00:49:08.088 --> 00:49:09.088
His financial records.

1043
00:49:10.505 --> 00:49:11.338
Look here.

1044
00:49:11.963 --> 00:49:15.630
The day before this all started.
before Christina Gomez found the money.

1045
00:49:15.713 --> 00:49:19.963
Jack Hansen withdrew $400.000 
from his account. all at once.

1046
00:49:20.421 --> 00:49:24.546
Then here. again. 
the day before the fifth bag appears.

1047
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:27.463
Hansen withdraws another $400.000.

1048
00:49:27.546 --> 00:49:29.588
I mean. that's gotta be more
than just a coincidence.

1049
00:49:29.671 --> 00:49:31.755
That's what you said
about the dead Realtor.

1050
00:49:32.255 --> 00:49:34.088
Okay. but this time I'm sure I'm right.

1051
00:49:34.713 --> 00:49:37.213
David. he wants to give me 
an exclusive interview.

1052
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:40.588
Any evidence 
you didn't get from Hansen himself

1053
00:49:40.671 --> 00:49:42.421
that you can corroborate
with another source?

1054
00:49:42.505 --> 00:49:43.963
Other than the Baylor tip. no.

1055
00:49:44.046 --> 00:49:46.505
but if we wait.
he could take the story elsewhere.

1056
00:49:46.588 --> 00:49:47.588
[David sighs]

1057
00:49:47.671 --> 00:49:50.505
Say yes and I will sit down with Hansen
right away.

1058
00:49:51.421 --> 00:49:52.255
I can't do it.

1059
00:49:53.171 --> 00:49:55.213
Station management 
will come down on me hard

1060
00:49:55.296 --> 00:49:57.505
if I go with you and not Susan 
for something this big.

1061
00:49:58.255 --> 00:50:01.171
You know what?
This story is not just about Jack Hansen.

1062
00:50:02.130 --> 00:50:07.338
This story is about how Channel 12 
was the first station to find Good Sam.

1063
00:50:07.421 --> 00:50:09.838
a man that everyone has been looking for.

1064
00:50:09.921 --> 00:50:12.421
And I am the only one
that can tell that story.

1065
00:50:14.213 --> 00:50:15.546
[sighs]

1066
00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:18.505
Jack. what inspired you to do this?

1067
00:50:20.088 --> 00:50:22.421
I wanted to help the workers.

1068
00:50:23.588 --> 00:50:28.005
Regular people who work two jobs 
to put a roof over their families' heads.

1069
00:50:28.088 --> 00:50:30.838
who pay taxes
while living paycheck to paycheck.

1070
00:50:30.921 --> 00:50:34.463
They're working longer and harder
these days and...

1071
00:50:34.921 --> 00:50:36.088
they should not be forgotten.

1072
00:50:36.505 --> 00:50:38.296
So why come forward now?

1073
00:50:39.171 --> 00:50:42.421
Um. many people were claiming to be me.

1074
00:50:42.505 --> 00:50:46.338
I just wanted to set the record straight
about what I wanted to accomplish.

1075
00:50:46.421 --> 00:50:47.463
And what is that?

1076
00:50:48.338 --> 00:50:53.130
I wanted to lend a hand
in the best way that I could...

1077
00:50:53.755 --> 00:50:54.588
to...

1078
00:50:54.963 --> 00:50:57.963
the soldiers in our everyday lives.

1079
00:50:58.963 --> 00:51:03.713
The people who keep our factories open.
who teach our kids in school.

1080
00:51:04.755 --> 00:51:06.588
Without those people...

1081
00:51:07.255 --> 00:51:08.713
our city could not function.

1082
00:51:09.630 --> 00:51:11.213
They deserve our support.

1083
00:51:11.963 --> 00:51:12.796
Thank you. Jack.

1084
00:51:14.963 --> 00:51:16.671
I've been speaking with Jack Hansen.

1085
00:51:16.755 --> 00:51:20.005
Manhattan hedge fund manager
who says he's Good Sam.

1086
00:51:20.088 --> 00:51:24.463
the man behind the anonymous cash gifts
being left on New York City doorsteps.

1087
00:51:24.546 --> 00:51:25.838
Over to you. Chuck.

1088
00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:27.505
[woman] And we're out.

1089
00:51:27.588 --> 00:51:29.255
-[cheering]
-[man] Wow.

1090
00:51:29.338 --> 00:51:32.505
-[man 2] That's it. Wrap it up.
-[man 3] Let's move it over. guys.

1091
00:51:32.588 --> 00:51:34.213
-[woman] Good story.
-[man 4] Next set up.

1092
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:37.671
So did you get. uh.
everything you wanted?

1093
00:51:37.755 --> 00:51:39.755
Oh. yeah. You couldn't have been better.

1094
00:51:40.171 --> 00:51:42.588
So I just got off the phone
with the network.

1095
00:51:42.671 --> 00:51:45.838
and they want a special report
for their national broadcast.

1096
00:51:45.921 --> 00:51:47.588
The story's going national tonight?

1097
00:51:47.671 --> 00:51:49.713
Yep. Uh. you better lay low

1098
00:51:49.796 --> 00:51:52.880
because. come six o'clock tonight.
you're gonna be a very famous man.

1099
00:51:52.963 --> 00:51:56.380
Ah. I'll make sure to enjoy 
my remaining anonymity.

1100
00:51:56.463 --> 00:51:58.338
This is a great thing you're doing here. 
Jack.

1101
00:51:58.421 --> 00:51:59.255
Thank you.

1102
00:52:00.463 --> 00:52:01.296
[laughs]

1103
00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:04.838
Wow. Uh. okay. I'm not ready
for this day to be over.

1104
00:52:05.296 --> 00:52:06.963
What do you think
about grabbing something to eat?

1105
00:52:07.046 --> 00:52:10.588
Sure. But you should keep 
a low profile tonight. like David said.

1106
00:52:10.921 --> 00:52:13.255
Do you know anywhere 
kind of out of the spotlight?

1107
00:52:13.338 --> 00:52:14.296
I know just the place.

1108
00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:15.880
-Great.
-[elevator bell dings]

1109
00:52:17.505 --> 00:52:20.921
[speaking Spanish]

1110
00:52:23.546 --> 00:52:24.505
Oh. wow.

1111
00:52:24.963 --> 00:52:29.088
Our interview aired 15 minutes ago
and we're already over 10.000 hits.

1112
00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:30.880
Are you surprised?

1113
00:52:31.755 --> 00:52:33.755
-You're a great interviewer.
-Thanks.

1114
00:52:33.838 --> 00:52:36.963
Okay. ready for the best Mexican food 
in Manhattan?

1115
00:52:37.046 --> 00:52:37.963
Yes. I am.

1116
00:52:39.338 --> 00:52:41.630
Oh. shoot. Channel 9's here. We should go.

1117
00:52:42.546 --> 00:52:45.171
-We should go out the back.
-Jack Hansen! Good Sam!

1118
00:52:45.255 --> 00:52:47.130
Who are you gonna give the money to next?

1119
00:52:47.213 --> 00:52:50.671
Um... I'm gonna make this brief.
I want to help the workers.

1120
00:52:50.755 --> 00:52:54.296
Uh. regular people who work two jobs
to put a roof over their families' heads.

1121
00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:56.671
who pay taxes
while living paycheck to paycheck.

1122
00:52:56.755 --> 00:53:00.046
They're working longer and harder
these days. and...

1123
00:53:00.130 --> 00:53:01.588
they should not be forgotten.

1124
00:53:02.255 --> 00:53:04.963
-Are you going to be giving again? 
-No more questions.

1125
00:53:08.713 --> 00:53:09.963
[exhales]

1126
00:53:10.046 --> 00:53:11.796
That was. uh...

1127
00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:13.088
unexpected.

1128
00:53:13.171 --> 00:53:15.838
Yeah. no kidding.
How did they know where to find us?

1129
00:53:16.505 --> 00:53:18.838
Someone must have followed us
from the station.

1130
00:53:18.921 --> 00:53:19.838
Oh.

1131
00:53:19.921 --> 00:53:22.963
Looks like we're not gonna able to stop
people from talking about Good Sam.

1132
00:53:23.046 --> 00:53:24.130
I guess not.

1133
00:53:25.421 --> 00:53:28.171
You know. 
I noticed that what you told the reporters

1134
00:53:28.255 --> 00:53:31.338
was almost word for word
what you said in our interview.

1135
00:53:32.671 --> 00:53:34.046
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

1136
00:53:35.755 --> 00:53:37.796
Guess I rehearsed too much last night.

1137
00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:40.588
Probably over-prepared for our interview.

1138
00:53:41.005 --> 00:53:42.130
I'm glad I did. though.

1139
00:53:42.213 --> 00:53:44.213
-You were phenomenal.
-[laughs]

1140
00:53:44.296 --> 00:53:47.630
I think. uh... I think you're gonna
be able to leverage this story for...

1141
00:53:48.130 --> 00:53:49.046
whatever you want.

1142
00:53:49.421 --> 00:53:51.838
Anchor. network. write your ticket.

1143
00:53:51.921 --> 00:53:53.838
That's not what I want out of this story.

1144
00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:55.671
Okay. Well. uh...

1145
00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:57.296
what. um...

1146
00:53:57.713 --> 00:53:58.838
what do you want then?

1147
00:53:59.421 --> 00:54:01.213
Why were you looking for me. for Good Sam?

1148
00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:03.338
Because he's...

1149
00:54:03.921 --> 00:54:07.088
You are exactly
what I didn't think existed.

1150
00:54:07.838 --> 00:54:11.088
Someone doing good.
expecting nothing in return.

1151
00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:13.713
I'm...

1152
00:54:14.421 --> 00:54:15.588
glad you found me then.

1153
00:54:16.338 --> 00:54:17.171
[chuckles]

1154
00:54:18.671 --> 00:54:19.505
Oh. um...

1155
00:54:20.255 --> 00:54:21.921
That's not what I meant. I...

1156
00:54:22.296 --> 00:54:23.338
Sorry. I...

1157
00:54:24.005 --> 00:54:25.213
I thought that. um...

1158
00:54:26.338 --> 00:54:29.796
-there was a spark between us.
-No. no. there was. but...

1159
00:54:30.546 --> 00:54:31.630
you're my story now.

1160
00:54:35.838 --> 00:54:37.630
Look. it's been a long day.

1161
00:54:38.421 --> 00:54:41.921
-Would you mind just taking me home?
-Yeah. Of course.

1162
00:54:42.005 --> 00:54:42.838
Um...

1163
00:54:44.130 --> 00:54:46.421
Let's. uh... Let's hop on the bridge.

1164
00:54:46.505 --> 00:54:47.755
-[driver] Mm-hmm.
-Thanks.

1165
00:54:54.130 --> 00:54:56.046
[horns honking in the distance]

1166
00:55:01.921 --> 00:55:02.755
[Kate] Hey.

1167
00:55:03.546 --> 00:55:06.713
I. um... I've been texting you
but hadn't heard back yet.

1168
00:55:07.088 --> 00:55:08.171
Sorry. it's been a...

1169
00:55:08.421 --> 00:55:10.130
-Been a rough shift.
-Oh.

1170
00:55:10.505 --> 00:55:14.130
And I was a little thrown the other night
when your Good Sam showed up.

1171
00:55:14.671 --> 00:55:16.963
Yeah. No. I was as surprised as you.

1172
00:55:17.463 --> 00:55:18.296
Really?

1173
00:55:18.713 --> 00:55:20.546
Thought he was your father's friend.

1174
00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:24.630
And I. uh. saw him leading you out 
of a restaurant last night on Channel 9.

1175
00:55:25.213 --> 00:55:27.546
Well. he's the subject of my story.

1176
00:55:28.171 --> 00:55:30.130
[woman] Anybody want a coffee? I'm going.

1177
00:55:30.213 --> 00:55:31.880
I'd say you've got your hands full.

1178
00:55:32.463 --> 00:55:34.796
Well. are we still on for dinner
tomorrow night?

1179
00:55:35.421 --> 00:55:37.630
[alarm sounds.
man speaks indistinctly over PA]

1180
00:55:37.713 --> 00:55:38.588
I'll text you.

1181
00:55:39.921 --> 00:55:41.380
Come on. guys. Get a move on!

1182
00:55:43.755 --> 00:55:44.921
[man] Hustle. hustle. hustle!

1183
00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:47.088
[Eric] Let's go. Come on!

1184
00:55:47.546 --> 00:55:48.505
[woman] Moving out!

1185
00:55:49.838 --> 00:55:51.963
[siren wailing]

1186
00:55:52.046 --> 00:55:53.630
Oh. my God. look. You have to see this.

1187
00:55:53.713 --> 00:55:55.963
National News Dispatch.
New York Daily View.

1188
00:55:56.046 --> 00:55:58.338
and don't even get me started
on your emails.

1189
00:55:58.421 --> 00:56:01.046
Your interview 
has over a million views online.

1190
00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:03.380
-I'm sorry. did you say a million?
-Yeah.

1191
00:56:03.796 --> 00:56:04.671
[Kate laughs]

1192
00:56:05.255 --> 00:56:07.796
-Well done. Kate. Good job.
-All right. people. Listen up.

1193
00:56:08.755 --> 00:56:11.088
Last night's interview with Good Sam

1194
00:56:11.171 --> 00:56:15.046
got us the highest ratings
in the station's history.

1195
00:56:15.130 --> 00:56:17.005
-[man 1] Yeah!
-[man 2] Good job!

1196
00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:20.338
Thanks to Kate. who got the interview

1197
00:56:20.421 --> 00:56:25.088
that every station and every network.
I might add. was trying to get.

1198
00:56:25.171 --> 00:56:26.255
And the story keeps growing.

1199
00:56:26.338 --> 00:56:29.046
Lauren. tell her about the call
we got from Washington Heights.

1200
00:56:29.130 --> 00:56:32.671
A woman called to say she started
an Anonymous Good Samaritan Club.

1201
00:56:32.755 --> 00:56:34.546
They'll be following
Good Sam's philosophy.

1202
00:56:34.921 --> 00:56:37.755
They've already bought a wheelchair 
for a veteran in their neighborhood.

1203
00:56:37.838 --> 00:56:40.171
And some guy in line at the grocery store
in Staten Island

1204
00:56:40.255 --> 00:56:42.088
anonymously paid for the next ten people.

1205
00:56:42.171 --> 00:56:43.630
-Wow.
-Kate. see if you can get Hansen

1206
00:56:43.713 --> 00:56:46.213
-to talk on camera to people he helped.
-Sure.

1207
00:56:46.296 --> 00:56:48.546
Lauren. give me
man-in-the-street-type interviews.

1208
00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:52.005
Ed. see if you can get some reaction
from workers on Good Sam's philosophy.

1209
00:56:52.088 --> 00:56:54.046
This is our time. people.

1210
00:56:54.130 --> 00:56:55.838
Let's take this story higher. huh?

1211
00:56:55.921 --> 00:56:56.838
Yeah! Whoo!

1212
00:56:59.713 --> 00:57:01.463
Guys. look! It's Good Sam.

1213
00:57:03.588 --> 00:57:04.671
[Christina] Good Sam!

1214
00:57:05.213 --> 00:57:06.755
Don't worry. You're gonna be great.

1215
00:57:07.838 --> 00:57:08.755
[Jack] Christina.

1216
00:57:09.963 --> 00:57:10.796
Hi.

1217
00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:12.671
[both laugh]

1218
00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:14.963
Oh. Good Sam.

1219
00:57:15.546 --> 00:57:16.463
Oh.

1220
00:57:16.963 --> 00:57:20.338
[speaking Spanish]

1221
00:57:21.713 --> 00:57:25.171
I can't thank you enough
for what you did for my family.

1222
00:57:25.546 --> 00:57:27.380
But how did you know we needed help?

1223
00:57:27.921 --> 00:57:31.130
I had a system for finding out
who was in need.

1224
00:57:31.213 --> 00:57:34.380
Uh. Jack. you said that you knew
about Christina's situation

1225
00:57:34.463 --> 00:57:36.671
because your assistant attends her church.

1226
00:57:36.755 --> 00:57:39.046
Oh. who is it? I want to thank her.

1227
00:57:40.296 --> 00:57:41.130
Carla...

1228
00:57:42.755 --> 00:57:44.380
Muñoz. Um...

1229
00:57:44.463 --> 00:57:47.088
Long dark hair. brown eyes.

1230
00:57:48.255 --> 00:57:51.338
She said that your faith.
uh. inspired her.

1231
00:57:53.088 --> 00:57:54.963
-[cell phone chimes and vibrates]
-Oh.

1232
00:57:55.505 --> 00:57:58.296
Uh. Kate.
are we just about wrapped up here?

1233
00:57:58.380 --> 00:57:59.630
I'm late for a meeting.

1234
00:57:59.713 --> 00:58:01.338
I just have a couple more questions.

1235
00:58:01.421 --> 00:58:03.630
It's gonna have to wait. unfortunately.

1236
00:58:03.963 --> 00:58:04.880
Sorry. Christina.

1237
00:58:06.046 --> 00:58:08.296
-We're done?
-Uh. yeah. Thanks. Christina.

1238
00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:09.796
Hey. is everything okay?

1239
00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:12.463
Uh. yeah. yeah. Uh...

1240
00:58:13.338 --> 00:58:16.880
I'm headed to Senator Wintour's party
tonight. I'll see you there?

1241
00:58:16.963 --> 00:58:19.796
Oh. um. I wasn't planning on it.
My dad's in D.C.

1242
00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:23.088
Still. he's a family friend. right?
And I'm going there.

1243
00:58:23.796 --> 00:58:24.671
It'll be fun.

1244
00:58:24.755 --> 00:58:26.088
Okay. I'll think about it.

1245
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:27.505
Thanks.

1246
00:58:27.921 --> 00:58:29.505
Don't know how he'll get through meetings

1247
00:58:29.588 --> 00:58:31.546
when all anyone's talking about
is Good Sam.

1248
00:58:33.505 --> 00:58:36.713
Something was off with Jack today.

1249
00:58:36.796 --> 00:58:38.255
Well. it's a lot to take in.

1250
00:58:38.338 --> 00:58:41.255
One day. he's managing a hedge fund.
the next. he's on the national news.

1251
00:58:41.338 --> 00:58:42.255
Still. though...

1252
00:58:42.755 --> 00:58:45.713
He seemed incredibly uncomfortable
around Christina.

1253
00:58:46.546 --> 00:58:47.671
Maybe he felt awkward.

1254
00:58:48.046 --> 00:58:51.088
He just gave the woman $100.000.
What's there to feel awkward about?

1255
00:58:51.171 --> 00:58:53.796
Yeah. well. when I give someone $100.000.
I'll let you know.

1256
00:58:54.671 --> 00:58:55.505
Fair enough.

1257
00:58:56.296 --> 00:58:58.671
[Jack]  I wanted to lend a hand

1258
00:58:58.755 --> 00:59:01.171
in the best way that I could...

1259
00:59:01.755 --> 00:59:04.880
to the people 
who keep our factories open...

1260
00:59:05.505 --> 00:59:09.130
who fix our cars and our plumbing...

1261
00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:10.796
who bake our bread...

1262
00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:11.921
How many times

1263
00:59:12.005 --> 00:59:15.005
are you gonna watch the Good Sam interview
you did with Jack Hansen?

1264
00:59:15.088 --> 00:59:18.088
As many times as it takes
for me to figure this thing out.

1265
00:59:18.171 --> 00:59:21.005
He's up to something.
I just don't know what it is yet.

1266
00:59:21.505 --> 00:59:22.671
Here. watch this.

1267
00:59:23.588 --> 00:59:25.171
-I wanted to...
-As Good Sam...

1268
00:59:25.630 --> 00:59:27.630
-...help the workers.
-...I want to help the workers.

1269
00:59:27.713 --> 00:59:31.671
[both]  Regular people who work two jobs
to put a roof over their families' heads.

1270
00:59:31.755 --> 00:59:34.380
Who pay taxes
while living paycheck to paycheck...

1271
00:59:34.713 --> 00:59:36.921
Look. the soundbites are near perfect.

1272
00:59:37.005 --> 00:59:38.380
It's almost too polished.

1273
00:59:38.463 --> 00:59:40.588
Yeah. you're right. Solid delivery too.

1274
00:59:40.671 --> 00:59:42.921
-Mm-hmm.
-[both]  They should not be forgotten.

1275
00:59:43.005 --> 00:59:46.171
[Kate]  Yet. some of the people you helped
weren't needy or poor.

1276
00:59:46.755 --> 00:59:48.213
-Can you do me a favor?
-Yeah.

1277
00:59:48.296 --> 00:59:51.880
Will you please tell David   that I am
chasing a lead at an event tonight?

1278
00:59:51.963 --> 00:59:53.880
Tonight? Why are you leaving now?

1279
00:59:54.338 --> 00:59:55.588
Ah. because it's black tie.

1280
00:59:55.671 --> 00:59:58.338
which means I probably should've started
getting ready two hours ago.

1281
00:59:58.421 --> 00:59:59.671
-Right.
-Thanks.

1282
01:00:03.005 --> 01:00:04.171
[sighs]

1283
01:00:08.296 --> 01:00:10.046
[Kate] I know. I know.

1284
01:00:10.546 --> 01:00:15.005
David. I'm sorry I bailed on work. 
but I can't tell you where I am right now.

1285
01:00:15.088 --> 01:00:16.338
At least. not just yet.

1286
01:00:16.921 --> 01:00:20.296
But I promise you. no other reporter 
is with Good Sam tonight.

1287
01:00:21.130 --> 01:00:22.505
Okay. I'll call you later.

1288
01:00:28.046 --> 01:00:31.671
Hi. My name is Kate Bradley.
I'm Ashok Bradley's daughter.

1289
01:00:32.171 --> 01:00:35.671
-Sorry. I don't see you on the list.
-Um...

1290
01:00:35.755 --> 01:00:38.755
Could you just tell Senator Wintour 
I'm here. please?

1291
01:00:38.838 --> 01:00:40.296
This is a private party.

1292
01:00:41.005 --> 01:00:42.338
-Kate!
-Hi!

1293
01:00:42.421 --> 01:00:45.255
What a surprise!
I didn't know you were coming.

1294
01:00:45.713 --> 01:00:47.380
-It's okay.
-May I take your things?

1295
01:00:47.463 --> 01:00:48.338
Please. Thanks.

1296
01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:49.463
Come in.

1297
01:00:49.796 --> 01:00:51.880
It was a last-minute decision.
I hope you don't mind.

1298
01:00:51.963 --> 01:00:54.088
-No.
-It's so nice to see you. Tom.

1299
01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:57.255
So. listen. you know Ashok's not here. 
right?

1300
01:00:57.338 --> 01:00:59.213
No. I know. He's still in D.C.

1301
01:00:59.296 --> 01:01:03.463
Um. I'm actually not here to see him.
I'm-- I'm looking for Jack Hansen.

1302
01:01:04.796 --> 01:01:05.921
Okay. so...

1303
01:01:06.546 --> 01:01:08.338
you know about the big announcement. then?

1304
01:01:08.421 --> 01:01:10.005
Uh... big announcement?

1305
01:01:10.796 --> 01:01:11.921
I'll let him tell you.

1306
01:01:12.005 --> 01:01:14.505
-Look. he's around here somewhere. so...
-I'll find him.

1307
01:01:14.588 --> 01:01:16.296
-Nice to see you.
-Nice to see you.

1308
01:01:16.755 --> 01:01:19.755
[man] Absolutely. One hundred percent.

1309
01:01:19.838 --> 01:01:21.963
Thank you so. so much.

1310
01:01:24.838 --> 01:01:30.588
Wow. this is the best surprise 
of the evening. You look astonishing.

1311
01:01:30.671 --> 01:01:31.588
Thank you.

1312
01:01:32.255 --> 01:01:34.546
I'm. uh. happy you made it after all.

1313
01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:35.463
Me too.

1314
01:01:36.046 --> 01:01:38.546
Hey. so. what's this big announcement
that Tom told me about?

1315
01:01:39.296 --> 01:01:41.171
Oh. I'm. uh...

1316
01:01:42.130 --> 01:01:43.255
I'm running for Congress.

1317
01:01:44.796 --> 01:01:45.630
What?

1318
01:01:46.963 --> 01:01:47.796
Um...

1319
01:01:48.213 --> 01:01:50.171
-When did you decide this?
-Uh...

1320
01:01:50.546 --> 01:01:54.296
A group of businessmen
approached me and...

1321
01:01:55.088 --> 01:01:56.171
convinced me to run.

1322
01:01:57.255 --> 01:01:59.005
So. wait. Um...

1323
01:01:59.088 --> 01:02:02.505
In our interview.
when you were talking about the workers.

1324
01:02:02.588 --> 01:02:05.171
the ones who live paycheck to paycheck. 
that was...

1325
01:02:05.838 --> 01:02:07.880
What? That was your campaign statement?

1326
01:02:08.588 --> 01:02:12.588
Kate. no.
I-I believe everything that I said.

1327
01:02:12.671 --> 01:02:16.505
It's why I gave away that money.
It's why I'm running for Congress.

1328
01:02:17.338 --> 01:02:18.171
So...

1329
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:20.921
how do you explain the gift to Marie?

1330
01:02:21.588 --> 01:02:22.421
Marie?

1331
01:02:22.505 --> 01:02:25.755
Yeah. she's the oncologist
who works at Parkland Hospital.

1332
01:02:26.296 --> 01:02:28.630
Lives in a three-million-dollar house
in Fort Greene.

1333
01:02:28.963 --> 01:02:31.921
Not exactly one of the workers 
that you claim to want to help.

1334
01:02:32.005 --> 01:02:33.630
Yeah. but. um...

1335
01:02:33.713 --> 01:02:37.380
she-- she also...
uh. is on a number of charitable boards.

1336
01:02:37.463 --> 01:02:39.796
and I... I just had this feeling. like.

1337
01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:42.380
she would do something good with it.
and she did.

1338
01:02:42.463 --> 01:02:46.546
Look. Kate. I know that you're not 
a big fan of the political world.

1339
01:02:46.921 --> 01:02:49.338
but your dad's given me his full support.

1340
01:02:50.546 --> 01:02:52.130
-Really?
-Yeah.

1341
01:02:52.213 --> 01:02:53.046
Hmm.

1342
01:02:53.546 --> 01:02:54.380
Wow.

1343
01:02:55.088 --> 01:02:57.046
Willing or not. 
you sure have figured out a way

1344
01:02:57.130 --> 01:02:59.796
to get the Bradleys involved 
in your big plan.

1345
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:03.630
Look. um...

1346
01:03:05.421 --> 01:03:08.463
I'm gonna make
a formal announcement on Friday.

1347
01:03:08.546 --> 01:03:10.630
and I'd love to give you 
an exclusive interview.

1348
01:03:10.713 --> 01:03:14.130
But. until then. 
can we keep this between me and you?

1349
01:03:15.088 --> 01:03:16.838
Sure. Why not?

1350
01:03:17.421 --> 01:03:18.880
[Wintour] Well. there you two are.

1351
01:03:22.130 --> 01:03:23.921
Kate. I've put you and Jack at our table.

1352
01:03:24.296 --> 01:03:26.463
Candace wants to catch up 
on everything you're doing.

1353
01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:29.505
You heard the big news?

1354
01:03:29.588 --> 01:03:31.130
Indeed I did.

1355
01:03:31.213 --> 01:03:33.505
and been promised an exclusive interview.

1356
01:03:34.213 --> 01:03:35.213
[Wintour chuckles]

1357
01:03:35.296 --> 01:03:37.671
Jack. the 12th district's
a real coveted seat.

1358
01:03:38.755 --> 01:03:41.546
And I think his idea 
of protecting the workers of this city

1359
01:03:41.630 --> 01:03:43.671
is gonna be a real breath of fresh air.

1360
01:03:44.046 --> 01:03:46.921
Jack. my boy. come with me.
There's somebody I want you to meet.

1361
01:03:47.005 --> 01:03:48.005
[Wintour chuckles]

1362
01:03:49.421 --> 01:03:50.921
[telephones rings]

1363
01:03:52.421 --> 01:03:54.296
David. I've got something.

1364
01:03:56.338 --> 01:03:59.338
Jack Hansen is running for Congress
in the 12th district.

1365
01:03:59.421 --> 01:04:01.838
-No kidding? 
-I'd vote for him. for sure.

1366
01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:03.296
[David] How do you know this?

1367
01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:06.963
I. uh... I crashed a party
at Senator Wintour's house last night.

1368
01:04:07.046 --> 01:04:10.171
He could give the incumbent a run.
now that Hansen's a name people know.

1369
01:04:10.255 --> 01:04:11.630
Yeah. thanks to us.

1370
01:04:11.963 --> 01:04:14.880
He's running on a public image
that we created for him.

1371
01:04:15.213 --> 01:04:17.213
It was never actual news.

1372
01:04:17.296 --> 01:04:20.505
Just a performance 
by yet another ambitious politician.

1373
01:04:20.588 --> 01:04:24.213
Well. at least Jack Hansen's trying
to help people. We could do worse.

1374
01:04:25.713 --> 01:04:27.255
[scoffs] Don't you get it?

1375
01:04:28.046 --> 01:04:29.380
He used us.

1376
01:04:29.838 --> 01:04:31.296
-[cell phone vibrates]
-Keep digging.

1377
01:04:32.213 --> 01:04:33.463
Sorry. guys.

1378
01:04:35.338 --> 01:04:37.671
Hey. Dad. Thanks for calling me back.

1379
01:04:37.755 --> 01:04:39.546
[Ashok]  My assistant said it was urgent.

1380
01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:40.713
It is.

1381
01:04:40.796 --> 01:04:42.755
Jack just told me
he's running for Congress.

1382
01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:46.380
I thought you said it was urgent. I left
a Senate Finance Committee meeting.

1383
01:04:46.463 --> 01:04:47.296
[Kate]  Dad. please.

1384
01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:49.671
I need to know when Jack decided to run.

1385
01:04:49.755 --> 01:04:51.880
When hasn't he talked about
running for office?

1386
01:04:51.963 --> 01:04:53.755
Was it the 12th district?

1387
01:04:53.838 --> 01:04:56.421
I remember a while back.
he asked if he had a shot.

1388
01:04:56.505 --> 01:04:58.213
And what? You said yes?

1389
01:04:58.838 --> 01:05:00.046
Are you backing him?

1390
01:05:00.130 --> 01:05:02.421
Well. actually. at the time. I said no.

1391
01:05:02.505 --> 01:05:04.505
The people who'd had that position

1392
01:05:05.005 --> 01:05:06.171
were always household names.

1393
01:05:06.255 --> 01:05:08.130
and Jack really didn't have that.

1394
01:05:08.505 --> 01:05:09.630
Not yet. anyway.

1395
01:05:10.255 --> 01:05:13.505
Not until he created Good Sam
to get everyone's attention.

1396
01:05:13.588 --> 01:05:15.963
Well. you can't really fault him

1397
01:05:16.046 --> 01:05:17.963
for taking advantage of notoriety.

1398
01:05:18.046 --> 01:05:20.005
And. as a Congressional candidate.

1399
01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:24.296
maybe he can take
this generosity movement and...

1400
01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:25.546
make some real change with it.

1401
01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:27.171
Dad. it's manipulative.

1402
01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:28.796
Can't you see that?

1403
01:05:30.546 --> 01:05:33.963
All right. Listen. I-I've gotta go.
I'll. um... I'll call you later.

1404
01:05:35.213 --> 01:05:36.046

1409

Hey. sit. I got it.

1410
01:05:54.046 --> 01:05:55.213
Okay. thanks.

1411
01:05:56.130 --> 01:05:58.380
You weren't lying. by the way.
You are a really good cook.

1412
01:05:58.796 --> 01:06:02.796
Well. you know. you pick up a thing or two
cooking for the guys at the fire station.

1413
01:06:04.046 --> 01:06:07.005
Listen. I think I made some assumptions 
about you and Jack.

1414
01:06:07.713 --> 01:06:10.463
And. um. I hope I misread some things.

1415
01:06:10.546 --> 01:06:13.380
Jack is just my interview subject.

1416
01:06:13.463 --> 01:06:15.963
And it turns out
you were right not to trust him.

1417
01:06:16.421 --> 01:06:17.755
He's running for Congress.

1418
01:06:18.130 --> 01:06:21.963
He launched a political career 
after coming forward as Good Sam.

1419
01:06:22.046 --> 01:06:23.005
[Kate] Exactly.

1420
01:06:23.713 --> 01:06:24.630
Just further proof

1421
01:06:24.713 --> 01:06:27.963
that no one does anything good 
without expecting something in return.

1422
01:06:29.088 --> 01:06:30.838
I like to think that's not true.

1423
01:06:33.338 --> 01:06:35.005
-Coffee?
-Ooh. yeah. Thanks.

1424
01:06:35.963 --> 01:06:38.296
So did you fix this place up yourself?

1425
01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:39.880
Because. man. it's amazing.

1426
01:06:39.963 --> 01:06:42.213
[Eric] Yeah. It's a work in progress.

1427
01:06:46.046 --> 01:06:48.463
Is this you
captaining this beautiful sailboat?

1428
01:06:48.546 --> 01:06:53.171
Yeah. That's when me and my brother took
the crew up to a friend's place in Maine.

1429
01:06:53.255 --> 01:06:54.630
Camden Harbor.

1430
01:06:55.546 --> 01:06:57.505
-Is this Patrick?
-Yeah.

1431
01:06:58.130 --> 01:07:00.713
He was always the first one on the boat
and the last one off.

1432
01:07:00.796 --> 01:07:01.963
Everyone called him Fish.

1433
01:07:02.046 --> 01:07:03.338
Hmm. Fish.

1434
01:07:03.838 --> 01:07:06.046
-Did you have a nickname?
-Hawkins.

1435
01:07:06.130 --> 01:07:08.255
Like the kid from  Treasure Island.

1436
01:07:08.338 --> 01:07:09.796
Hawkins. I like that.

1437
01:07:11.671 --> 01:07:13.088
And who's that?

1438
01:07:14.546 --> 01:07:16.380
Um. just a friend of my brother's.

1439
01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:21.546
So is this what dinner's always like
with a reporter? All the questions.

1440
01:07:21.630 --> 01:07:24.255
Pretty much.
When was the last time you went sailing?

1441
01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:29.880
Come on. That wasn't a hard one. was it?

1442
01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:34.755
Not since Patrick died.

1443
01:07:36.255 --> 01:07:37.838
It just hasn't felt right without him.

1444
01:07:39.171 --> 01:07:40.880
I'm sorry. I-I didn't realize.

1445
01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:45.630
Do you mind if I ask what happened?

1446
01:07:46.255 --> 01:07:47.963
Ah. you don't wanna hear about that.

1447
01:07:50.046 --> 01:07:52.255
I'm listening. if you want to tell me.

[exhales]

1449
01:08:00.838 --> 01:08:01.796
Um...

1450
01:08:03.838 --> 01:08:06.921
My brother and I went sailing in May 
for my birthday.

1451
01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:11.005
And he was so excited...

1452
01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:14.380
about this new route 
that he'd planned out and...

1453
01:08:16.005 --> 01:08:18.838
and the surprise he had for me 
when we got there.

1454
01:08:20.046 --> 01:08:21.505
And the weather was perfect.

1455
01:08:22.755 --> 01:08:25.296
Sun in the sky. a few clouds.

1456
01:08:26.546 --> 01:08:28.380
And then the wind just picked up.

1457
01:08:29.213 --> 01:08:30.380
and all of a sudden...

1458
01:08:30.755 --> 01:08:34.130
this wall of water just came toward us.

1459
01:08:36.421 --> 01:08:38.213
And the boom swung loose and...

1460
01:08:39.130 --> 01:08:41.630
hit Patrick in the head.
knocked us both overboard.

1461
01:08:43.505 --> 01:08:46.255
I had to fight through the swell 
to get to him.

1462
01:08:47.838 --> 01:08:49.213
And he was unconscious.

1463
01:08:50.713 --> 01:08:51.755
and bleeding a lot.

1464
01:08:55.046 --> 01:08:56.796
I tried CPR. but...

1465
01:08:59.421 --> 01:09:00.546
I lost him.

1466
01:09:05.421 --> 01:09:06.588
I'm so sorry.

1467
01:09:10.255 --> 01:09:12.630
You see. 
I'm not the hero everyone thinks I am.

1468
01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:16.421
I couldn't even save my own brother.

1469
01:09:16.505 --> 01:09:18.630
Hey. you did everything you could.

1470
01:09:20.171 --> 01:09:22.671
You risked your life to save him.

1471
01:09:23.338 --> 01:09:25.130
You do that every single day.

1472
01:09:27.671 --> 01:09:29.380
You may not think you're a hero...

1473
01:09:30.171 --> 01:09:31.130
but I do.

trying you again.

Can you please call me back 
when you get a chance? Thanks.

1477
01:09:48.296 --> 01:09:53.088

in the spreadsheet. A note section.

-[Kate] Anything interesting?
-[Lauren] Um...

1479
01:09:55.213 --> 01:09:59.755
On the first 400-grand withdrawal
from Jack. there's some initials.

PDD.

1481
01:10:01.796 --> 01:10:03.546
Is that one of the people who got money?

-Mmm. no. No one has the initials PDD.

01:10:11.130 --> 01:10:13.796
[Kate]  When you found me and Jack
at that taco place.

1486
01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:15.463
how did you know where he'd be?

1487
01:10:16.005 --> 01:10:17.463
He sent out a press release.

1488
01:10:17.546 --> 01:10:18.713
A press release?

1489
01:10:18.796 --> 01:10:20.505
Yeah. Or his publicist put it out.

1498
01:10:34.338 --> 01:10:37.421
-PDD is Parker Dunlop Development.
-Oh.

1499
01:10:37.505 --> 01:10:39.630
-What?
-It's a political consulting agency.

1500

-Very high-end.
-They groom candidates for public office.

Uh. campaigns. policy. media coaching.

But why would they get paid in cash?

1504
01:10:49.796 --> 01:10:50.755
Oh. Lauren.

1505
01:10:51.171 --> 01:10:53.213
You have so much to learn about D.C.

1506
01:10:53.296 --> 01:10:56.880
Okay. hold on.
When was the second $400.000 withdrawal?

1507
01:10:56.963 --> 01:10:57.880
[Lauren] Mmm...

1508
01:10:58.588 --> 01:11:00.255
October 27th.

1509
01:11:00.838 --> 01:11:01.671
[Kate] Right.

1510
01:11:02.088 --> 01:11:05.880
The day after Jack and I had dinner 
and talked about Good Sam.

1511
01:11:05.963 --> 01:11:09.963
So if Jack's first 400.000 was spent 
on political consulting instead--

1512
01:11:10.046 --> 01:11:12.380
Then who was behind the money 
in the first four bags?

1513
01:11:12.463 --> 01:11:13.463
Where are you going?

1514
01:11:17.130 --> 01:11:19.296
When were you gonna tell me 
that you weren't Good Sam?

1515
01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:20.588
I'm gonna call you back.

1516
01:11:22.046 --> 01:11:24.005
What are you talking about?
Of course I'm Good Sam.

1517
01:11:25.046 --> 01:11:27.796
But you didn't tell me the whole story.
now. did you. Jack?

1518
01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:31.505
The first $400.000 
you spent on campaign expenses?

1519
01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:33.213
PDD.

1520
01:11:33.296 --> 01:11:36.796
Why don't you tell me the truth. Jack? 
And tell me like it really happened.

1521
01:11:38.505 --> 01:11:40.713
I did give away the last 400.000.

1522
01:11:41.921 --> 01:11:42.838
And the rest?

1523
01:11:43.296 --> 01:11:45.130
Somebody else gave that away. 
I don't know who.

1524
01:11:45.671 --> 01:11:47.421
And you just took credit for it?

1525
01:11:48.213 --> 01:11:49.046
Look...

1526
01:11:49.255 --> 01:11:54.088
Um. I'd never seen anything like the media
attention the guy was getting.

1527
01:11:54.171 --> 01:11:57.963
Everywhere I went. people were
talking about Good Sam. Even you.

1528
01:11:58.046 --> 01:12:03.255
And I know how important it is for you 
to find someone doing good.

1529
01:12:03.338 --> 01:12:04.338
I'm that guy.

1530
01:12:04.421 --> 01:12:07.463
I wasn't just looking 
for someone doing good. Jack.

1531
01:12:08.171 --> 01:12:11.421
I was looking for someone doing good 
who didn't expect anything in return.

1532
01:12:11.505 --> 01:12:12.921
and that is not you.

1533
01:12:13.005 --> 01:12:15.921
I might not be the guy
who started this whole thing. but...

1534
01:12:16.505 --> 01:12:17.588
I did.

1535
01:12:17.671 --> 01:12:19.880
I gave away $400.000.
That's got to count for something.

1536
01:12:19.963 --> 01:12:24.130
You gave money away for publicity 
so that you could run for Congress.

1537
01:12:24.588 --> 01:12:27.671
Kate. we're both getting a lot of mileage
out of this story.

1538
01:12:27.755 --> 01:12:29.505
That's what this is about? Mileage?

1539
01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:31.838
You lied. Jack.

1540
01:12:32.546 --> 01:12:36.046
So. what. the truth doesn't matter as long
as you get what you want. Is that it?

1541
01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:39.880
Okay. how-- how--
how can I fix this... with you?

1542
01:12:39.963 --> 01:12:43.088
Would it make a difference
if I gave away another $400.000?

1543
01:12:43.630 --> 01:12:44.463
Wow.

1544
01:12:45.588 --> 01:12:47.713
Where does the truth end
and the lie begin?

1545
01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:50.296
Hold on. Let's talk about this.

1546
01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:51.213
Kate!

1547
01:12:51.796 --> 01:12:52.630
Kate...

1548
01:12:55.255 --> 01:12:56.796
What? Say that again.

1549
01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:59.171
[Kate]  I said Jack Hansen isn't Good Sam.

1550
01:12:59.588 --> 01:13:02.671
This is the kind of thing that ruins 
a station's reputation and kills careers.

1551
01:13:02.755 --> 01:13:04.588
-Yours and mine.
-David. let her talk.

1552
01:13:04.671 --> 01:13:05.630
He lied to me.

1553
01:13:06.255 --> 01:13:07.921
He just admitted that he's a copycat.

1554
01:13:08.213 --> 01:13:10.880
After the real Good Sam 
gave away $400.000.

1555
01:13:11.463 --> 01:13:13.380
-Jack stepped in and did the same thing.
-Great.

1556
01:13:13.463 --> 01:13:16.255
He's been working
with a D.C. press agent for months.

1557
01:13:16.338 --> 01:13:17.171
We got played.

1558
01:13:17.255 --> 01:13:19.421
Okay. so if Jack Hansen isn't Good Sam.
then who is?

1559
01:13:19.505 --> 01:13:23.046
Well. maybe the real Good Sam's in hiding.
you know. to protect his identity.

1560
01:13:23.130 --> 01:13:24.963
Maybe he's got his own agenda.
A marketing ploy.

1561
01:13:25.046 --> 01:13:27.546
There's always the criminal angle.
The money's some kinda repayment?

1562
01:13:27.630 --> 01:13:30.796
Guys. I don't think the real
Good Sam is doing this for anything.

1563
01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:31.963
Oh. come on.

1564
01:13:32.046 --> 01:13:33.213
No. I'm serious.

1565
01:13:33.755 --> 01:13:35.546
Look. when I first got put on the story.

1566
01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:38.671
I was sure Good Sam
had some ulterior motive.

1567
01:13:39.546 --> 01:13:42.046
I've been working the bummer beat
for years...

1568
01:13:42.130 --> 01:13:45.255
and we know it always gets the ratings.

1569
01:13:45.588 --> 01:13:50.463
But we choose to show the selfish.
violent things people do every day.

1570
01:13:50.963 --> 01:13:53.588
when we know that there are
way more people out there doing good.

1571
01:13:53.671 --> 01:13:56.421
Oh. that's a real nice sentiment. Kate.
I'm getting all choked up here.

1572
01:13:56.505 --> 01:13:58.421
But that doesn't tell us
who the real Good Sam is.

1573
01:13:58.505 --> 01:14:00.630
-Come on. people. Have we got any ideas?
- Not yet.

1574
01:14:00.713 --> 01:14:03.421
But we've gotta go back
to the first four money drops.

1575
01:14:03.505 --> 01:14:05.755
Christina. Marie. Jesse. and Faith.

1576
01:14:05.838 --> 01:14:08.338
-Find out what they have in common.
-[David] Let me think.

1577
01:14:08.421 --> 01:14:09.713
Uh. uh. uh...

1578
01:14:09.796 --> 01:14:10.755
Where do they all live?

1579
01:14:10.838 --> 01:14:13.421
All over. 
Bronx. Brooklyn. Manhattan. Staten Island.

1580
01:14:13.505 --> 01:14:16.880
All right. so that's not it. 
What about schools. clubs. associations?

1581
01:14:16.963 --> 01:14:18.796
-Anything in common?
-No. nothing. We checked.

1582
01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:20.921
-All born in New York?
-Marie was born in Brooklyn.

1583
01:14:21.005 --> 01:14:23.296
-Faith was born here too.
-[Lauren] No. No go.

1584
01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:27.338
Christina was born in Mexico
and Jesse's from Maine. Camden Harbor.

1585
01:14:27.421 --> 01:14:28.255
[Kate]  Sorry. what?

1586
01:14:28.338 --> 01:14:31.421
Oh. Camden Harbor on the coast of Maine.

1587
01:14:31.505 --> 01:14:32.546
Camden Harbor...

1588
01:14:33.296 --> 01:14:35.505
Okay. I-I. uh-- I have a hunch.
I'll call you back.

1589
01:14:35.588 --> 01:14:37.921
No. no. no. wait. wait. Where are you?
I'll send a news van.

1590
01:14:38.005 --> 01:14:40.130
You can't shoot a hunch. David.
Give me some time.

1591
01:14:40.213 --> 01:14:41.380
[David]  No. Kate. wait. Just--

1592
01:14:41.796 --> 01:14:42.630
Taxi.

1593
01:14:42.713 --> 01:14:45.005
[siren wails in the distance]

1594
01:14:45.088 --> 01:14:46.921
[keyboard keys clacking]

1595
01:14:47.005 --> 01:14:48.630
Do you think this could be the--

1596
01:14:48.713 --> 01:14:49.921
[fast-forwarding]

1597
01:14:54.046 --> 01:14:56.463
I-I hurt my back a while ago.

1598
01:15:12.046 --> 01:15:13.088
Wait here. please.

1599
01:15:13.171 --> 01:15:16.546
Hey. Jesse. Uh. you got a couple 
of minutes to talk about Good Sam?

1600
01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:17.755
I'm running behind.

1601
01:15:18.213 --> 01:15:20.880
Well. I saw a photo 
of someone who looked like you

1602
01:15:20.963 --> 01:15:23.338
on a sailboat with Patrick and Eric Hayes.

1603
01:15:23.421 --> 01:15:25.005
Sailing with the Hayes boys.

1604
01:15:25.755 --> 01:15:27.213
It's probably me then. yeah.

1605
01:15:27.671 --> 01:15:28.963
So you knew them?

1606
01:15:29.046 --> 01:15:31.130
I was practically a member of the family.

1607
01:15:31.713 --> 01:15:34.046
Patrick was my best friend 
since fourth grade.

1608
01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:37.463
I did. uh. all the woodwork on his boat.
You know. the  Crazy Eight.

1609
01:15:39.130 --> 01:15:40.963
I'm sorry. you said the  Crazy Eight?

1610
01:15:41.671 --> 01:15:42.505
Yeah.

1611
01:15:42.588 --> 01:15:44.630
Yeah. the accident
really wrecked all of us.

1612
01:15:44.713 --> 01:15:46.421
Eric more than anyone else. but...

1613
01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:48.546
Are you doing a story about a sailboat?

1614
01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:50.713
Yeah. in a way. I might be.

1615
01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:52.505
[engine turns over]

1616
01:15:57.963 --> 01:16:00.463
Hi. it's Kate from Channel 12 News.

1617
01:16:00.755 --> 01:16:02.130
I have a question for you.

1618
01:16:02.713 --> 01:16:04.463
Did you know Patrick Hayes?

1619
01:16:04.546 --> 01:16:06.880
[woman]  Yeah. I. uh. worked with Patrick

1620
01:16:06.963 --> 01:16:08.838
at Inniswell Properties.

1621
01:16:09.713 --> 01:16:11.296
First job as a paralegal.

1622
01:16:12.088 --> 01:16:14.130
He was great at the business part.

1623
01:16:14.213 --> 01:16:17.630
but. uh. he had dyslexia.
so reading wasn't easy for him.

1624
01:16:18.296 --> 01:16:21.130
I helped him with research. contracts...

1625
01:16:21.213 --> 01:16:24.005
I was Patrick and Eric's babysitter.

1626
01:16:24.671 --> 01:16:25.505
[chuckles]

1627
01:16:25.588 --> 01:16:27.546
I started when they were little kids.

1628
01:16:27.921 --> 01:16:30.421
and then they grew up 
right in front of my eyes.

1629
01:16:30.505 --> 01:16:34.130
Yes. Patrick Hayes was my patient
several years ago.

1630
01:16:35.546 --> 01:16:39.588
I can't discuss specifics. but I can say
he made a remarkable recovery.

1631
01:16:41.463 --> 01:16:42.963
He was always so grateful.

1632
01:16:44.255 --> 01:16:46.213
But I just did what doctors do.

1633
01:16:46.671 --> 01:16:47.546
But. um...

1634
01:16:48.130 --> 01:16:49.796
Patrick can't be your Good Sam...

1635
01:16:50.796 --> 01:16:51.796
because he died...

1636
01:16:52.463 --> 01:16:53.296
months ago.

1637
01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:54.463
[knocking]

1638
01:17:01.046 --> 01:17:02.255
-Hey.
-[Kate] Hi.

1639
01:17:02.588 --> 01:17:04.338
-Uh. come on in.
-Thanks.

1640
01:17:08.713 --> 01:17:10.671
-Uh. let me grab your things.
-Thanks.

1641
01:17:16.338 --> 01:17:20.755
Christina Gomez was your babysitter 
when you and Patrick were little.

1642
01:17:21.546 --> 01:17:24.255
Faith Haywood's first job 
was at your brother's company.

1643
01:17:24.588 --> 01:17:27.505
Dr. Ellis was Patrick's doctor 
when he was sick.

1644
01:17:28.130 --> 01:17:30.421
And Jesse Durham was his best friend.

1645
01:17:31.005 --> 01:17:34.255
He used to go sailing with you guys 
all the time on the  Crazy Eight.

1646
01:17:35.046 --> 01:17:36.380
You're Good Sam. aren't you?

1647
01:17:38.671 --> 01:17:39.671
Come on in.

1648
01:17:39.755 --> 01:17:40.588
Let's talk.

1649
01:17:41.796 --> 01:17:42.630
[Eric sighs]

1650
01:17:46.088 --> 01:17:46.921
Thanks.

1651
01:17:50.005 --> 01:17:50.838
So...

1652
01:17:51.713 --> 01:17:54.046
where did you get all this money 
to give away?

1653
01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:58.921
My brother's boat was destroyed
in the accident.

1654
01:17:59.838 --> 01:18:00.755
And...

1655
01:18:01.671 --> 01:18:03.171
I got an insurance check...

1656
01:18:04.421 --> 01:18:05.796
for over 400 grand.

1657
01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:10.046
I told them that it wasn't my boat. but...

1658
01:18:10.755 --> 01:18:13.796
as it turns out. 
Patrick transferred the ownership to me.

1659
01:18:16.130 --> 01:18:18.005
Apparently. that was my surprise.

1660
01:18:19.255 --> 01:18:21.588
He was giving me the  Crazy Eight
for my birthday.

1661
01:18:24.296 --> 01:18:25.546
[inhales sharply]

1662
01:18:26.088 --> 01:18:27.338
But I failed him.

1663
01:18:32.046 --> 01:18:34.088
So I couldn't keep the money.

1664
01:18:35.630 --> 01:18:37.463
So that's why you gave it all away.

1665
01:18:40.255 --> 01:18:42.213
There are these friends of his...

1666
01:18:44.463 --> 01:18:46.130
who really made his life better.

1667
01:18:47.088 --> 01:18:48.505
You know. in different ways.

1668
01:18:51.005 --> 01:18:52.130
I just thought...

1669
01:18:53.171 --> 01:18:54.838
they deserved it more than me.

1670
01:18:56.963 --> 01:19:00.713
But why not just give the money 
to them directly?

1671
01:19:02.421 --> 01:19:04.296
I thought they'd enjoy it more and...

1672
01:19:05.713 --> 01:19:06.796
do what they needed with it

1673
01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:09.463
if they weren't weighed down 
by where it came from.

1674
01:19:14.255 --> 01:19:16.963
I'm really sorry about your brother.

1675
01:19:18.463 --> 01:19:21.421
But I think he'd be so proud 
of what you've done here.

1676
01:19:25.713 --> 01:19:26.588
Thanks.

1677
01:19:30.255 --> 01:19:32.296
I cannot be your story.

1678
01:19:35.921 --> 01:19:37.255
It's not about a story.

1679
01:19:38.755 --> 01:19:39.630
Not anymore.

1680
01:19:46.755 --> 01:19:48.046
Channel 12 News has learned

1681
01:19:48.130 --> 01:19:51.380
that Jack Hansen is not the Good Samaritan
he claimed to be.

1682
01:19:52.130 --> 01:19:55.963
While Jack Hansen did give away
the last $400.000.

1683
01:19:56.046 --> 01:19:58.671
he was not behind the first four gifts.

1684
01:19:59.213 --> 01:20:01.213
Rather. he copied the original Good Sam

1685
01:20:01.296 --> 01:20:04.171
in order to promote 
his own political ambitions.

1686
01:20:04.921 --> 01:20:06.505
So who is the real Good Sam?

1687
01:20:07.046 --> 01:20:09.880
Unlike Hansen. he seeks no attention.

1688
01:20:10.421 --> 01:20:14.671
Instead. he's asked to remain anonymous.
expecting nothing in return.

1689
01:20:14.755 --> 01:20:16.796
And a remarkable thing has happened.

1690
01:20:17.421 --> 01:20:21.671
The recipients of Good Sam's generosity
became Good Sams themselves.

1691
01:20:22.088 --> 01:20:24.005
One gave a car to her neighbor.

1692
01:20:24.421 --> 01:20:27.421
One. a substantial donation 
to a local food bank.

1693
01:20:27.505 --> 01:20:31.880
Another started a scholarship 
for paralegals hoping to become lawyers.

1694
01:20:31.963 --> 01:20:35.838
The recipient in Brooklyn 
gave all the money to cancer research.

1695
01:20:36.296 --> 01:20:38.213
What Good Sam never expected

1696
01:20:38.296 --> 01:20:40.963
was that we would be inspired
by his example.

1697
01:20:41.463 --> 01:20:44.213
Some people say
New York City is a tough place.

1698
01:20:44.505 --> 01:20:46.713
A place where everyone's 
out for themselves.

1699
01:20:47.213 --> 01:20:49.171
But as I look across our city.

1700
01:20:49.546 --> 01:20:52.463
I see more kindness between strangers 
than competition.

1701
01:20:53.046 --> 01:20:55.588
I see people reaching out
to help others...

1702
01:20:55.880 --> 01:21:00.505
on street corners. subway platforms.
and in apartment hallways.

1703
01:21:01.130 --> 01:21:02.338
Thanks to Good Sam.

1704
01:21:02.421 --> 01:21:04.713
we're becoming 
better versions of ourselves.

1705
01:21:05.213 --> 01:21:07.630
Kate Bradley. Channel 12 News.

1706
01:21:07.713 --> 01:21:09.213
-Good work.
-Thanks.

1707
01:21:09.296 --> 01:21:11.671
-Beautiful reporting. Kate.
-Thank you.

1708
01:21:12.046 --> 01:21:12.921
[Kate] Bye. guys.

1709
01:21:13.630 --> 01:21:15.255
[horns honking]

1710
01:21:22.588 --> 01:21:23.796
[cell phone vibrates]

1711
01:21:27.338 --> 01:21:28.171
Hey. Dad.

1712
01:21:28.255 --> 01:21:30.755
I saw your report on Jack Hansen.

1713
01:21:30.838 --> 01:21:32.588
You were right about him all along.

1714
01:21:33.171 --> 01:21:34.755
I should have trusted your instincts.

1715
01:21:35.921 --> 01:21:37.671
That's okay. I appreciate that. Dad.

1716
01:21:37.755 --> 01:21:39.880
Whoever the real Good Sam is.

1717
01:21:40.213 --> 01:21:44.421
a man like that 
makes us see the world... differently.

1718
01:21:45.213 --> 01:21:48.255
You haven't met him.
but I think you'd really like him.

1719
01:21:48.713 --> 01:21:51.796
Anyone that makes you happy 
is all right by me.

1720
01:21:52.463 --> 01:21:53.296
Thanks. Dad.

1721
01:21:53.796 --> 01:21:56.130
-Night. Katie.
- Okay. good night. Love you.

1722
01:22:03.046 --> 01:22:05.713
-[Kate laughs] I was not flirting.
-[Eric laughs]

1723
01:22:06.171 --> 01:22:08.796
-[Eric] Really? Not even a little?
-[Kate] Okay. maybe a little.

1724
01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:10.338
[both laugh]

1725
01:22:13.421 --> 01:22:15.713
-So I brought a little surprise for you.
-Oh.

1726
01:22:15.796 --> 01:22:17.130
-Close your eyes.
-Okay.

1727
01:22:19.713 --> 01:22:20.546
All right.

1728
01:22:20.963 --> 01:22:21.796
Open.

1729
01:22:24.588 --> 01:22:26.088
[Kate gasps] Cool.

1730
01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:29.755
Are we going stargazing?

1731
01:22:30.130 --> 01:22:31.046
Not quite.

1732
01:22:32.046 --> 01:22:34.505
It's a clue
for where I'm gonna take you tomorrow.

1733
01:22:35.171 --> 01:22:36.005
Hmm.

1734
01:22:36.255 --> 01:22:37.505
Hayden Planetarium?

1735
01:22:38.421 --> 01:22:39.296
The North Pole?

1736
01:22:39.838 --> 01:22:40.963
A pirate-themed party?

1737
01:22:41.421 --> 01:22:44.046
That's actually closer. It's on the water.

1738
01:22:45.921 --> 01:22:47.380
The Brooklyn Bridge?

1739
01:22:49.171 --> 01:22:50.796
Are you asking me to go sailing?

1740
01:22:51.296 --> 01:22:52.255
Yeah. I am.

1741
01:22:53.130 --> 01:22:55.838
And look at that. 
For once. it's me asking you questions.

1742
01:22:55.921 --> 01:22:56.755
[Kate] Hmm.

1743
01:22:56.838 --> 01:22:57.671
[laughs]

1744
01:23:02.421 --> 01:23:03.755
[woman] Uh. hello?

1745
01:23:04.671 --> 01:23:06.130
I think you've got a fan.

1746
01:23:07.421 --> 01:23:08.255
Hi.

1747
01:23:08.338 --> 01:23:10.713
-Excuse me. are you Kate Bradley?
-[Kate] Yeah.

1748
01:23:10.796 --> 01:23:12.380
-From Channel 12?
-Mm-hmm.

1749
01:23:13.421 --> 01:23:15.921
I was wondering 
if you would. uh. thank Good Sam for me.

1750
01:23:16.630 --> 01:23:18.463
Sure. but what for?

1751
01:23:18.546 --> 01:23:21.588
I just received a scholarship 
to go to college.

1752
01:23:21.671 --> 01:23:23.296
The school didn't know where it came from.

1753
01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:25.713
but I thought for sure
it was from Good Sam.

1754
01:23:26.005 --> 01:23:28.671
Um... a full scholarship?

1755
01:23:28.755 --> 01:23:29.838
All four years.

1756
01:23:30.671 --> 01:23:32.713
Other kids in my graduating class
got them as well.

1757
01:23:32.796 --> 01:23:33.963
plus kids in other schools.

1758
01:23:34.046 --> 01:23:36.546
We all received one of these.

1759
01:23:40.171 --> 01:23:41.005
[Kate] Hmm.

1760
01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:44.505
Do you think it's from Good Sam?

1761
01:23:45.088 --> 01:23:47.046
I don't know. I'd have to ask him.

1762
01:23:48.630 --> 01:23:52.130
Oh. I gotta run. but if it is Good Sam
behind all of this...

1763
01:23:53.171 --> 01:23:54.546
[exhales] ...thank him for me.

1764
01:23:54.921 --> 01:23:55.880
Sure.

1765
01:23:55.963 --> 01:23:57.046
Yeah. definitely.

1766
01:24:02.796 --> 01:24:04.338
Do you know anything about this?

1767
01:24:04.421 --> 01:24:05.463
It wasn't me.

1768
01:24:05.755 --> 01:24:06.588
[Kate] Huh.

1769
01:24:07.630 --> 01:24:09.838
Um... I'm doing my good deeds right here.

1770
01:24:09.921 --> 01:24:11.130
[giggles]

1771
01:24:13.921 --> 01:24:16.338
-And tomorrow. when I take you sailing.
-Mm-hmm.

1772
01:24:21.380 --> 01:24:23.546
So wait. Really.
you had nothing to do with that?

1773
01:24:23.630 --> 01:24:24.713
[laughs] I swear.

1774
01:24:26.338 --> 01:24:28.130
You really want to chase that story.
don't you?

1775
01:24:28.213 --> 01:24:29.046
Kind of.

1776
01:24:30.130 --> 01:24:31.213
Go ahead. I can wait.

1777
01:24:32.505 --> 01:24:34.380
Mmm... in a second.

1778
01:24:35.671 --> 01:24:36.921
[man] Kick it over here!

1779
01:24:37.005 --> 01:24:38.463
["Absolutely" plays]

1780
01:24:40.005 --> 01:24:41.755
Okay. I'll be back.
