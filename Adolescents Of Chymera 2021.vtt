- Feeling good. Lucky!

15
00:00:23.584 --> 00:00:24.740
Let's start off with my boy.

16
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.630
He's howling like a dog in heat

17
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.038
like he is. you know what I'm saying?

18
00:00:28.038 --> 00:00:28.871
- That's right man.

19
00:00:28.871 --> 00:00:30.127
Bones. my man Praxedias

20
00:00:31.221 --> 00:00:32.572
what's up. man

21
00:00:32.572 --> 00:00:34.330
- Puerto Rico!

22
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.420
Yo. tell the world. man.

23
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.580
the world don't know stuff about us.

24
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.730
Tell them about
- The world. man

25
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:38.563
- your world. man.

26
00:00:38.563 --> 00:00:40.740
- The world. there's two worlds.
talking about two worlds.

27
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.470
My world. our world.

28
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.175
And then there's the other world.

29
00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.140
How you doing girl?

30
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.020
You know. you're so sexy. man.

31
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.350
I think one day you and
me should get together.

32
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.410
- Drop it. Lucky.

33
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.650
I think we
should you know what I mean

34
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.643
- Lucky. drop it now.

35
00:01:05.643 --> 00:01:06.609
All right!

36
00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:08.368
Ew. look at that guy!

37
00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:09.201
Ew!

38
00:01:12.347 --> 00:01:13.680
Oh. man!

39
00:01:14.638 --> 00:01:15.748
- Look at him!

40
00:01:52.105 --> 00:01:57.105
to be taken for a ride

41
00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:23.501
the mystery of Highway 40

42
00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:37.299
that drives the hearse

43
00:02:39.328 --> 00:02:43.705
is never in remission

44
00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:48.705
it's just another curse

45
00:02:55.473 --> 00:02:59.753
following a star

46
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.680
- Good afternoon. everyone.

47
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.850
Good afternoon. Dee.

48
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.000
- I'd like to welcome our
new resident to the family.

49
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.610
Roy. I'm looking forward
to working with you.

50
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.540
and I hope we can make a
real difference in your life.

51
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.979
Thank you family.

52
00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:41.896
Thank you. Dee.

53
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.090
- All right. listen up.

54
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.840
Now that we're on summer break.

55
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.490
we have lots of work to do to
get the house back in shape.

56
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.130
Remember. this is your home.

57
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.430
So give it the love and
attention it deserves.

58
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.423
Any questions about chores?

59
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.310
Then let's get to it.

60
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.361
Monica and Theresa can
adjourn. thank you family.

61
00:04:03.361 --> 00:04:05.014
- Thank you. Daryl.

62
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:34.823
- Checking on chores.

63
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.290
It's no good. do it over.

64
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:44.740
- What are you talking about?

65
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.920
- It's not good enough.

66
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.300
Daryl likes things to sparkle.

67
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.463
- Yeah. well things are sparkling.

68
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.520
- That ain't acceptable. man.

69
00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.750
- Nobody can see under there.

70
00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:57.583
- I can.

71
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.350
- So who are you?

72
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.040
- I'm the DM. your discipline monitor.

73
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.100
That means you obey my reasonable requests

74
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.150
or I can give you consequences.

75
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.417
- That's bullshit.

76
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.540
- That's bullshit. huh?

77
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.090
Disrespecting peer authority

78
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.470
Failure to follow staff direction.

79
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.509
provoking attitude. foul language.

80
00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:23.290
Get the idea?

81
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.190
- That's fucked up

82
00:05:25.421 --> 00:05:26.588
- That's life.

83
00:05:27.475 --> 00:05:29.475
Get back to work.

84
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.410
- Roy. what are you doing out here?

85
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.480
- I just needed some space.

86
00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.983
- You didn't ask permission.

87
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.580
- I need permission to
sit in the backyard?

88
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.280
- Until you knew our system.

89
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.030
you'd better ask
permission for everything.

90
00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.580
And never go outside without Dee

91
00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.440
or me knowing where you are.

92
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.280
Otherwise it's an AWOL contract

93
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.980
and threatens your placement.

94
00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.800
Do you understand?

95
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.633
- Look. I just needed-

96
00:06:49.633 --> 00:06:51.330
- Do you understand what I'm saying?

97
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.843
- Yeah.

98
00:07:05.567 --> 00:07:07.450
Fuck this place.

99
00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:08.290
- What happened?

100
00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:09.720
.

101
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.520
He treats me like a two year old.

102
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.590
- He's into power tripping. all right.

103
00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:14.423
But what do you expect

104
00:07:14.423 --> 00:07:16.600
when the guy was in 'Nam for 10 years?

105
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.800
- Yeah. well not one
of his stupid soldiers.

106
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.813
- You're gonna have to get used to it.

107
00:07:22.711 --> 00:07:24.970
I mean. he's not such a bad
guy once you get to know him

108
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.310
- I don't want to get to know him.

109
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.260
I just want to get the fuck outta here.

110
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:31.673
- Don't think like that. man.

111
00:07:31.673 --> 00:07:34.340
It's gonna make time go much slower.

112
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.430
- And what's his trip anyway?

113
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.090
- Well. you see. I heard
that he was a real screw up

114
00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:39.380
until he joined the army.

115
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.230
then he learned all
about rules. discipline.

116
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:42.541
and shit like that.

117
00:07:42.541 --> 00:07:44.010
You know. got his act together.

118
00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.920
I guess he thinks it's
gonna work for us too.

119
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.803
- So he wants to save our souls.

120
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:52.010
- Hey. you know. it could be a lot worse.

121
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.310
At least the guy's heart's
in the right place.

122
00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.173
- Failure to follow staff directions.

123
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:03.353
throwing an object. and
having a negative attitude.

124
00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.340
What's up Keisha. what happened?

125
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:13.138
- I got some bad news about my son.

126
00:08:13.138 --> 00:08:14.020
He all right?

127
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.940
- Well. my sister gone moved to Texas

128
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.650
and she taken Ricky with her.

129
00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:20.253
I'm not going to see my
baby for a long time.

130
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:21.973
Sorry.

131
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.720
Look. Keisha what's going
to be your retribution?

132
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.553
- I don't care.

133
00:08:27.553 --> 00:08:30.500
Dishes. hallways. windows. whatever.

134
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.888
Do we agree?

135
00:08:31.888 --> 00:08:33.080
Yeah. it's cool.

136
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:33.913
- Roy.

137
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:39.870
Noncompliance of structure.
failure to complete chores.

138
00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.850
disrespecting peer authority.

139
00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:44.800
You know how the system works?

140
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.582
- I told him all about it.

141
00:08:46.582 --> 00:08:48.523
- You got to choose
your own punishment man.

142
00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.070
- Well. I didn't do anything wrong.

143
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:53.550
- Ain't no fighting the bookings.
just choose your chores.

144
00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.200
- But I didn't do anything wrong.

145
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.150
- Are you refusing to
abide by family rules?

146
00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.780
- I'm refusing to say
I'm guilty when I'm not.

147
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.430
- You wouldn't be here
unless you were guilty.

148
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:05.550
That's not what this is about.

149
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.760
Either you're a member of
this family or you're not.

150
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.211
- That's a joke.

151
00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:15.950
- Do you want to go back to the hall?

152
00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:17.420
- Oh. so that's my choice?

153
00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.710
Roll over and kiss your
ass. or go back to the hall?

154
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:20.860
- Go to your room. Roy.

155
00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:24.310
Go.

156
00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:25.810
Take some time. cool down.

157
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:38.880
Fool's crazy.

158
00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:47.353
- Can I talk to you?

159
00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:52.340
- Come in.

160
00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.410
- Close the door.

161
00:09:58.852 --> 00:10:01.410
- Oh I can't. it's against the rules.

162
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:03.110
But I have permission to be here.

163
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:05.560
I'm supposed to represent
you at your initiation.

164
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:07.403
- What?

165
00:10:07.403 --> 00:10:08.670
- They're going to have an initiation

166
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.890
to see if you're
appropriate for this house.

167
00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:12.890
and I've volunteered to be your support.

168
00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:18.200
See. what happens is
they have this big dinner

169
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.090
and while everyone eats asks
you a bunch of questions.

170
00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:22.270
It's kind of like a trial. you know.

171
00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:23.840
to see if you'll fit into our family.

172
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.820
And we call it the initiation.

173
00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.330
- Yeah and what if I don't want to do it?

174
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.330
- Well. you don't have a choice.

175
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:30.973
What happens?

176
00:10:30.973 --> 00:10:32.712
- Then you won't be able to stay.

177
00:10:40.956 --> 00:10:42.927
- Yeah. I'll show you guys
how to barbecue. all right?

178
00:10:42.927 --> 00:10:45.323
This is what separates
the men from the boys.

179
00:10:46.156 --> 00:10:47.054
- What're you talking about?

180
00:10:47.054 --> 00:10:49.000
- I've had all kind of
picnics at the house Daryl.

181
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.860
I didn't flip major meat.

182
00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.435
He said major meat. you hear that?

183
00:10:53.268 --> 00:10:55.030
- I am not talking about a picnic here.

184
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.870
I'm talking about a barbecue.

185
00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:57.333
- I'll tell you what I
let you listen to a man.

186
00:10:57.333 --> 00:10:58.670
I'll show you how to really barbecue.

187
00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:00.410
- Look Lucky. it is not the time yet.

188
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.380
Step away. let a real man
show you how it's done.

189
00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:03.300
thank you very much.

190
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:05.260
- We know you. man.

191
00:11:07.397 --> 00:11:09.660
- Oh. no I can't take that.

192
00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.620
- Oh. ash on a bun. yum. yum.

193
00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:12.813
- This Mesquite. right?

194
00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:16.000
- I'm not dealing with E. Coli.

195
00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.290
- There you go. see?

196
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.320
- Hey Laura. come here Laura.

197
00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.433
Ladies first.

198
00:11:21.433 --> 00:11:22.335
- Thanks.

199
00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.250
- Good evening family.

200
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.330
Before we get started. I'd like to say

201
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.290
a few words about the initiation.

202
00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:33.520
I want you all to remember

203
00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.540
what it was like when you went through it.

204
00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:38.740
You were new. you didn't know anybody.

205
00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.210
And suddenly you were put in a situation

206
00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:41.043
where you had to answer

207
00:11:41.043 --> 00:11:43.090
a lot of tough questions about yourselves.

208
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:47.830
It took a lot of courage.

209
00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:49.180
So let's keep that in mind.

210
00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.710
- I got a question for you.

211
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.110
Okay. here's the situation.

212
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:58.790
Family Day. happens once
a month around here.

213
00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:02.070
As usual. my grandmother's
the first to arrive.

214
00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:03.960
Like she does every other time.

215
00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.450
she checks to make sure I'm not around.

216
00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:08.320
then she grabs whoever's first to walk by.

217
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.707
Let's say it's your break time.

218
00:12:09.707 --> 00:12:11.900
And you're rushing. trying
to get out of the kitchen

219
00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.410
away from other work.

220
00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:16.470
But when you see her.
she won't let you go.

221
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:17.410
Here's the challenge. Roy.

222
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:18.870
This is what I want to know.

223
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.140
Would you give up your break time.

224
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.609
help her do what she wants?

225
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.680
Or would you leave first chance you got?

226
00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.893
- I don't get it. what
does she want me to do?

227
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.870
- She's my grandmother. Roy.

228
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:33.730
If she wants your help. isn't that enough?

229
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:34.563
- I don't know.

230
00:12:34.563 --> 00:12:36.360
She sounds pretty weird to me.

231
00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.193
Damn!

232
00:12:40.138 --> 00:12:41.488
- It's called respect. Roy.

233
00:12:42.559 --> 00:12:43.830
You ever heard of that?

234
00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:46.610
What if it was your family
and now disrespected them?

235
00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:48.290
Would that make a difference?

236
00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:49.700
- Let's just leave them out of it okay?

237
00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.520
- No. it's an important question.

238
00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.330
I want you to answer it.

239
00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.760
- Well. I don't think my
family is any of your business.

240
00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.380
- I think they are.

241
00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.080
Isn't he supposed to ask our questions?

242
00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:02.123
- Talking about our families
is part of the program. Roy.

243
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:05.620
It's not easy. but you need to do it.

244
00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.070
- Come on. just tell them
what they want to hear.

245
00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.923
- This is bullshit. I'm not
gonna. I don't want to play.

246
00:13:13.792 --> 00:13:15.230
Please. Roy?

247
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:18.000
- Ever heard the term.
image breaking. Roy?

248
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.600
Is what they do in military boot camps.

249
00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.000
breaking down the recruits'
old civilian image

250
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.290
and replacing it with a soldier.

251
00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:26.880
We do things a little
differently around here.

252
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.040
but it's basically the same idea.

253
00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.637
Suddenly you have to
face up to who you are

254
00:13:31.637 --> 00:13:33.587
before we can change what doesn't work.

255
00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:39.810
Are you ready for a real challenge. Roy?

256
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.648
Can I get a couple of
volunteers to get the mirror?

257
00:13:44.648 --> 00:13:45.481
- Me!

258
00:13:45.481 --> 00:13:47.455
- Aw. he's going to get it.

259
00:13:47.455 --> 00:13:48.288
- Oh. man.

260
00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:55.280
- Please stand facing the mirror.

261
00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:05.440
Straight in front. Roy.

262
00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.273
All right.

263
00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.860
Look at that person in the mirror.

264
00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.460
Can you tell us who he is?

265
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.520
- He's Roy.

266
00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.260
- I can't hear you.

267
00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.360
- He's Roy.

268
00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.410
- Describe Roy to us.

269
00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:33.510
- He's got Brown hair. blue
eyes. white skin. some pimples.

270
00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:36.173
- That is good.

271
00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:38.350
That's who he is on the outside.

272
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:40.893
Now. tell us who he is on the inside.

273
00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:43.093
- I don't know what you mean.

274
00:14:43.093 --> 00:14:44.530
- Look at him. Roy.

275
00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:45.980
You described his outer features.

276
00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.160
now describe his inner ones.

277
00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.733
Look into his eyes and
tell us what you see.

278
00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.433
- Nervous.

279
00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:57.680
- I can't hear you.

280
00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:00.220
- Nervous.
- What else?

281
00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:06.190
- I don't know.

282
00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:08.350
- Need some help?

283
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.410
Can anyone to help Roy?

284
00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:17.243
- He's scared.

285
00:15:20.742 --> 00:15:23.243
- Well. if you agree
with her. then tell him.

286
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:30.400
- You're scared.

287
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.840
- Anything else?

288
00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.673
- He's angry.

289
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.570
- You're angry.
- I can't hear you.

290
00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:36.830
- He's angry.

291
00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:39.260
- He be looking suspicious to me.

292
00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:40.550
- He suspicious.

293
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:42.023
- He's courageous.

294
00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:45.810
- He's courageous.

295
00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:48.193
- He's just a wild and crazy guy.

296
00:15:51.982 --> 00:15:54.070
- He's a wild and crazy guy.

297
00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:56.430
- All right. good.

298
00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:58.180
Now that's what we expect from you

299
00:15:58.180 --> 00:15:59.480
while you live in this house

300
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.523
straight up honesty. even if it's hard.

301
00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:38.060
- Hi.
- Hi.

302
00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:39.050
- You got a minute.

303
00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:39.883
- Yeah.

304
00:16:48.908 --> 00:16:51.787
- I wanted to tell you something.

305
00:16:51.787 --> 00:16:54.210
You know the real reason I'm staying.

306
00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:55.213
It's because of you.

307
00:17:01.365 --> 00:17:03.282
- They are going to AA.

308
00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:14.938
All over to the AA.

309
00:17:14.938 --> 00:17:16.938
All over to the AA. now!

310
00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:22.690
- Want to continue some other time.

311
00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:25.540
- The next thing I remember.
I'm lying in a pool of blood.

312
00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:28.140
Mine in the back of an ambulance.

313
00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.690
Blood is pouring in my eyes and my mouth.

314
00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:32.440
I remember spitting up so much blood

315
00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.800
they keep telling me to knock it off.

316
00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.420
When I was sewn up in semi-auto shock

317
00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:41.300
I started screaming the pain
from having your face bashed

318
00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.240
and kicked in is brutal.

319
00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.620
And the morphine didn't help.

320
00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.890
Like any drug that wears off.

321
00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:49.640
I got up. I went into the bathroom

322
00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.670
in the mirror with some
months it looked like it came

323
00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:54.590
from a bad slasher flick.

324
00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:56.780
And that was the last day I drank.

325
00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.840
The DTS. the shakes. the itching.

326
00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.150
all at other and other story.

327
00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:02.070
But I'm telling you.

328
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:05.870
it's such a tough gamble
to drink and do drugs.

329
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:07.403
You always lose.

330
00:18:08.311 --> 00:18:10.210
And that's all I have to say.

331
00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:11.560
So I want to hear from you.

332
00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.290
What's your drug of choice?

333
00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:16.350
- I use crack a couple of times.

334
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:17.560
I liked it.

335
00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:18.620
- Ecstasy.

336
00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:19.453
- Spirit.

337
00:18:19.453 --> 00:18:20.657
.

338
00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:23.970
- Marijuana's cool.

339
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:25.210
- Sometimes I drink.

340
00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:26.830
- LSD.

341
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:27.890
- All of them. man.

342
00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:29.268
I like them all.

343
00:18:32.513 --> 00:18:33.346
- You.

344
00:18:33.346 --> 00:18:36.400
- I like the bud because
it makes you laugh.

345
00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:40.410
Makes you happy and relaxed
and it doesn't turn you

346
00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:43.713
into an addict or a bad side
effects like those other drugs.

347
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.920
- Yo. Steve man. that's not true.

348
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.763
It makes me feel stupid and tired.

349
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.573
- You are stupid and tired.

350
00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:55.320
- Why do you use LSD?

351
00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.730
- Cause LSD is the only
drug. that's not an escape.

352
00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:00.660
Makes you see things in a
new way without all the BS

353
00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.650
that expands your mind.

354
00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:05.490
- Do you mean it makes you crazy.

355
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:07.180
That's why people would
be jumping out of windows.

356
00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:10.190
Thinking they could
fly like Jordan. maybe.

357
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:11.237
Hell are we here?

358
00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:16.180
- All right. let's talk about
why people stopped using.

359
00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:17.110
Why did you quit?

360
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:19.220
- I quit for my baby.

361
00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.053
- You?

362
00:19:20.053 --> 00:19:21.060
- Because I'm in here.

363
00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.660
And if we get caught. Daryl
will send us to the Hall.

364
00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:26.140
- You still want to use
after all that's happened?

365
00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.880
Haven't you learned
anything from this program?

366
00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.770
- Yeah. I learned from my mistake

367
00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:31.349
next time I won't get caught.

368
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:35.040
- Wake up people.

369
00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.523

370
00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:39.380
Don't you care about being locked up.

371
00:19:40.528 --> 00:19:42.428
Don't you care about the consequences.

372
00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.100
- I'll tell you what I care about.

373
00:19:50.171 --> 00:19:52.960
I was stuck in here and
all the drugs is out there.

374
00:20:03.723 --> 00:20:06.400
Don't piss like that cause you know fuck.

375
00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.570

- What?

377
00:20:10.403 --> 00:20:12.013
- Lets go to my room.

378
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:16.250
I got inspired listening
to everyone in AA.

379
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:19.330
I think I know how to get
some acid into the house.

380
00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:20.623
- How?
- Right there.

381
00:20:23.079 --> 00:20:24.890
No. no I mean it it's a carrier

382
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:26.940
and it's ready to fly to my house

383
00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:29.370
and I can have my brother tie
some blotter paper to its leg

384
00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:31.040
and then it'll fly back here.

385
00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.330
Daryl is not gonna search a pigeon.

386
00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:34.163
- Are you serious?

387
00:20:34.163 --> 00:20:35.750
- Oh yeah.

388
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:37.510
- Steve. you're a genius.

389
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:38.343
Let's do it.

390
00:20:38.343 --> 00:20:39.560
- It'll take a few days to set it up.

391
00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.689
I have to call my brother first.

392
00:20:50.745 --> 00:20:53.340
- Hey can I talk to you for a minute?

393
00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:54.690
- Yeah. what about?

394
00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:58.010
- I want to spend some
time with Laura alone

395
00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:00.527
and I wanted to know if
you could help me out.

396
00:21:06.409 --> 00:21:09.076
- Anything with keeping in that.

397
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:16.100
Are you going to have sex with her?

398
00:21:18.503 --> 00:21:20.683
- I don't know. maybe.

399
00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.403
- That is breaking a Cardinal rule.

400
00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:26.380
You just have no idea. do you?

401
00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:29.223
Daryl catches you and you're
gone. no questions asked.

402
00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.000
- Well. that's why I was asking you.

403
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.050
I was hoping you could advise me on

404
00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:35.450
when and where it's safest.

405
00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:37.060
That sort of thing.

406
00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:41.370
- If I help you with this. if you allow me

407
00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:44.690
because that's the way
we do things around here

408
00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:47.343
all favors must be
returned. simple as that.

409
00:21:48.881 --> 00:21:50.131
We have an understanding?

410
00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:52.383
Do we?

411
00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:54.573
- Absolutely.

412
00:21:58.434 --> 00:21:59.820
- Come on.

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:03.610
- You sure you got that right. Roy?

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:04.890
I don't do bathrooms.

worked together. Roy.

545
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:16.920
- It's not fair you make me do windows.

546
00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.243
I'm too small.

547
00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:22.150
- All right. house meeting's over.

548
00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:23.253
Let's get to work.

549
00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:27.863
- Roy?

550
00:30:30.098 --> 00:30:32.290
You're taking job too serious. okay?

551
00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:34.183
You don't know how things work here yet.

552
00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:10.623
- Minh. what the hell are you doing?

553
00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:12.753
- What?

554
00:31:12.753 --> 00:31:14.400
- Why aren't you doing your chores?

555
00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.320
- I told you. man. I twisted my ankle.

556
00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:17.610
- Did you clear with Daryl?

557
00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:19.743
- Nah. man you're the DM. I'm telling you.

558
00:31:20.741 --> 00:31:22.230
- I'm giving you consequences.

559
00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:23.253
- I don't think so.

560
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:27.950
I thought you'd be
missing your masterpiece.

561
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:30.650
- Give that to me.

562
00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:34.710
Where'd you get that?

563
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:36.390
- Fineness keeper.

564
00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:37.890
- You better give that to me. Minh.

565
00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:40.333
- I was thinking. Daryl
might like to see it.

566
00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:42.360
- What do you want for it?

567
00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:43.960
- Do my chores for a week.

568
00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.340
- Fine. now give it to me.

569
00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:48.900
- I'm going to keep it. but
I promise not to show Daryl.

570
00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:51.599
- If you do. I will beat
the shit out of you.

571
00:31:51.599 --> 00:31:53.099
- Get out of my room. asshole.

572
00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:56.970
Attention to everybody.

meet me in the lounge.

575
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:02.962
Thank you.

576
00:32:08.159 --> 00:32:09.913
- I'm so much fun.

577
00:32:09.913 --> 00:32:11.428
- You know what Monica?

578
00:32:44.519 --> 00:32:45.627
- Quiet!

579
00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:11.613
- See. this is my stepdad
and that's my uncle.

580
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:15.420
And this is Lily. the little
girl I used to babysit for.

581
00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:16.726
Isn't she cute?

582
00:33:16.726 --> 00:33:18.020
- Yeah.

583
00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:19.990
- And this is Arnold. my neighbor's dog.

584
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:21.240
Isn't that weird looking?

585
00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:23.570
- Yeah.

586
00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:25.270
- And this is where I live.

587
00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:27.620
It's really boring. I
have to drive everywhere.

588
00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.010
- What are they?

589
00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:33.736
- They're just messed up.

590
00:33:33.736 --> 00:33:34.686
- Come on. show me.

591
00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:37.413
- Not. just not now.

592
00:33:37.413 --> 00:33:38.246
- Okay. I thought we weren't

593
00:33:38.246 --> 00:33:39.210
going to keep secrets from each other.

594
00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:41.873
- They're not secret is
I'm just embarrassed.

595
00:33:43.175 --> 00:33:44.300
- How come?

596
00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.163
- Just cause they're just stupid.

597
00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:48.960
- Like why are you making
such a big deal out of this

598
00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:49.793
just show me.

599
00:33:49.793 --> 00:33:52.193
- No. do you want to see some others?

600
00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:55.742
- Everybody ready to go?

601
00:33:55.742 --> 00:33:56.825
Yeah.

602
00:33:59.293 --> 00:34:01.290
- Dee. can I bring a video camera please?

603
00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:02.916
- If you're responsible for it.

604
00:34:07.662 --> 00:34:08.580
- Oh. Tamara house what's up.

605
00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:11.650
We had a picnic here and we
got ducks in the place. oh.

606
00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:12.760
What's really going on. huh?

607
00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:16.022
Look at the scenery. check
this house. pretty bird. wow.

608
00:34:16.022 --> 00:34:17.610
This is where she'd be like all the time.

609
00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:18.687
You know. that's my boys and my aunts

610
00:34:18.687 --> 00:34:21.437
and so my girls they're
eating. having a good old time.

611
00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:25.130
Yo Prax it's a good sandwich. man.

612
00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:26.820
How about letting me have a bite?

613
00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:28.858
Give me a bite. I want to get.

614
00:34:28.858 --> 00:34:30.853
you're a slob. man.

615
00:34:30.853 --> 00:34:34.670
- This is the most festive
sandwich known to man.

616
00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:35.503
- Okay.

617
00:34:38.205 --> 00:34:39.310
What the hell is that?

618
00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:40.351
Oh no.

619
00:34:40.351 --> 00:34:41.204
It look like a crab.

620
00:34:41.204 --> 00:34:42.960
That's some
nasty shit. look at that.

621
00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.720
- How much are you going
to give me if eat this?

622
00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:46.145
Nothing.

623
00:34:46.145 --> 00:34:49.302
- Mm.

624
00:34:53.406 --> 00:34:55.280
Get away!

625
00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:58.620
- Guys slob is good.
Lucky you want it Steve!

626
00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:03.480
- I think the chips have
given me food poisoning

627
00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:06.110
but it's kind of a neat feeling.

628
00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:08.213
- I could really go for a sandwich.

629
00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:11.100
That'll do.

630
00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:13.053
- I can go for two Senyoritas too.

631
00:35:16.186 --> 00:35:18.743
Man. well what can I do now. huh?

632
00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:22.365
Dude!

633
00:35:22.365 --> 00:35:24.012
You didn't see me man. you didn't see me.

634
00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:27.483
Oh shot. what's this?

635
00:35:28.628 --> 00:35:29.800
A little secret
romance coming here.

636
00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:30.731
Roy. what do you think?

637
00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:34.764
Go Roy.

638
00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.740
- So when are you supposed to graduate?

639
00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:40.040
- In a few weeks. I think.

640
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:42.420
- Really. that soon.

641
00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:44.323
- Yeah. I've been here for 10 months.

642
00:35:46.429 --> 00:35:47.960
- You're going to live at home.

643
00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:48.793
- I hope not.

644
00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:51.440
- How come. cause of your dad?

645
00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.175
- No. my stepdad.

646
00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:56.327
- You know. when I was
little my dad used to take me

647
00:35:56.327 --> 00:35:58.790
to this little cabin in the Sierras

648
00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:01.410
and we'd have to hike a few miles

649
00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:02.760
from the road to get to it.

650
00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:05.910
But there was never anybody else around.

651
00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.110
I mean. it was. it was incredible.

652
00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:16.110
I mean. there was a stream
and trees and lots of deer

653
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.963
and we would just stay there for days.

654
00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:27.203
Fish or just hang out.

655
00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:32.190
Well sometimes when things get really bad

656
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:33.790
I think about going there again.

657
00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:38.453
It makes me feel better
just thinking about it.

658
00:36:40.253 --> 00:36:41.903
- I wish I had a place like that.

659
00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:49.280
- You can share mine with me if you want.

660
00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:52.620
- So I guess I won't be seeing much of you

661
00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:53.683
for awhile. Lucky.

662
00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:56.080
- Why that baby?

663
00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.520
You got another man?

664
00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.216
- You never quit.

665
00:36:59.216 --> 00:37:00.560
You know. I am proud of you though

666
00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:03.020
for starting this new job tomorrow.

667
00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:04.730
I just hope you stick with it long enough

668
00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:06.100
to learn something.

669
00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:07.470
- Yeah.

670
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:09.410
Yeah. I like working on cars.

671
00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:11.910
I got a lot of experience
from stealing them.

672
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:14.770
- Lucky. this could be your big break.

673
00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:17.060
Don't go out there and blow it.

674
00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:17.893
- No. not me.

675
00:37:18.864 --> 00:37:20.540
I know a good thing when I see it.

676
00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:21.483
- I hope so.

677
00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.270
Lucky. would you run over there

678
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:29.730
and tell Roy and Laura
to turn it to her hand.

679
00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:31.473
They've gone way too far.

680
00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:38.363
- Come on.

681
00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:47.220
It's beautiful. huh?

682
00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:57.093
- You fool?

683
00:37:59.219 --> 00:38:00.052
Hey you.

684
00:38:03.079 --> 00:38:03.912

- All right.

711
00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.930
Take some space. step back.

- Hit me. coward.
- Get in the van. Roy.

Get in the van.

717
00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:22.270
- You have some explaining to do. Roy.

718
00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:24.150
I need to know if you and
Laura having a relationship

719
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:25.950
and I want you to tell me the truth.

720
00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:26.900
- What do you mean?

721
00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:32.190
We talk sometimes like nothing's going on.

722
00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:33.690
- And how do you explain this?

723
00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:38.080
- It's a drawing. it's just a fantasy.

724
00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.060
- You are really pushing my buttons.

725
00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:41.770
This isn't a game we're playing here. Boy.

726
00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:43.650
Either you work on our program
and follow all our rules

727
00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:46.000
or there's no point in you being here.

728
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.280
And if I catch you anywhere
near Laura in the next few days.

729
00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.420
you'll be back on the hall so fast

730
00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:51.853
and make your head spin. try me.

731
00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:55.020
And I'm confiscating this.

732
00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:58.883
You're room restricted
until further notice.

733
00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:38.410
Laura. come to the staff office.

734
00:41:38.410 --> 00:41:40.737
Laura to the staff office.

735
00:41:45.962 --> 00:41:47.093
Come in.

736
00:41:48.728 --> 00:41:49.630
- You want to see me.

737
00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:52.220
- We have some good news for you. Laura.

738
00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:55.140
Daryl and I have picked a
date for your graduation.

739
00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:56.600
- When?

740
00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:57.880
- This coming Sunday.

741
00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:59.440
- In three days?

742
00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:00.590
- We've talked to your dad.

743
00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:02.040
He's all for it.

744
00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:04.060
Congratulations. Laura.

745
00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:05.480
- I don't think I'm ready.

746
00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:06.697
- You don't want to graduate?

747
00:42:06.697 --> 00:42:08.011
- No. I'm not ready yet.

748
00:42:08.011 --> 00:42:10.010
I just want to stay a few more months.

749
00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:12.320
- I know you're scared Laura

750
00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:15.830
but you've been at Chimera
House for 10 months now.

751
00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:18.220
It's time to move on with your life.

752
00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:19.730
- I'm not ready.

753
00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:21.230
- Laura. you're just anxious.

754
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:22.320
Everyone gets nervous

755
00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.153
when there's big changes in their life.

756
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:28.670
Have a seat Laura.

757
00:42:34.843 --> 00:42:37.970
Laura. I'm going to try
something to get you to relax.

758
00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:38.803
All right?

759
00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:46.300
Just watch the chain
and listen to my voice.

760
00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:47.600
- Daryl. stop.

761
00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:50.760
- You're thinking about
how nice it will be

762
00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:53.630
when you graduate. how
everything will be. okay.

763
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:55.059
- What are you doing to me?

764
00:42:55.059 --> 00:42:55.892
Stop!

765
00:42:55.892 --> 00:42:57.073
- Laura. you will graduate.

766
00:42:58.421 --> 00:43:00.420
And everything will be just fine.

767
00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:01.920
- You can't make me go.

768
00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:04.483
I am not going back there.
I'm not going to go.

769
00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:12.710
- Hey man. don't even sweat it. all right.

770
00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.366
As soon as I go. Dee is
going to walk up in here

771
00:43:15.366 --> 00:43:16.440
and she's going to have a serious talk

772
00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:18.090
about you and your attitude.

773
00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:19.300
This is going to cut to some kind of deal.

774
00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:20.320
You're going to be off restriction man

775
00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:21.873
before I even get to work.

776
00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:24.910
But just don't forget Dee
is the shrink. all right?

777
00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:27.790
So. you know. talk to
her about your feelings

778
00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:29.280
and shit like that.

779
00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:30.780
You're going to get off light.

780
00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:34.460
I'm ready to leave.

781
00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:36.632
I got to go. so we'll
talk to later. right?

782
00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:40.480
The fall in the real world.

783
00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:43.350
- Lucky. welcome to DAN

Tires.

791
00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:09.930
- You're off restriction?

792
00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:11.010
- Yeah.

793
00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:12.950
Well. everything is ready to go.

794
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:14.290
- Talked to your brother?

795
00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:17.090
- That's affirmative. the
product is waiting for pickup.

796
00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:19.600
- Let's do it now.

797
00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:20.433
- All right.

798
00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:24.093
Take it easy.

799
00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.600
Turn them over so he
can get his leg there.

800
00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.417
- There we go.
- It's all right.

801
00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:36.040
Looks good.

802
00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:37.280
Yeah. there you go.

803
00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:39.550
- Let me get him. let me get him.

804
00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:40.383
Are you ready?

805
00:44:40.383 --> 00:44:41.997
All right. good luck. you know what to do.

806
00:44:41.997 --> 00:44:42.989
Good luck come on.

807
00:44:43.822 --> 00:44:45.710
Give it a kiss. for luck.

808
00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:46.543
- You want me to kiss the bird?

809
00:44:46.543 --> 00:44:47.643
- Yeah. come on.

810
00:44:49.570 --> 00:44:50.861
All right then.

811
00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:58.483
Go baby girl.

812
00:45:22.195 --> 00:45:23.656
- Welcome back.

813
00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:27.880
- You haven't done the toilets.

814
00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:29.560
- Well. I couldn't find the brush.

815
00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:30.610
- You still got to do them.

816
00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:32.780
I'll do it when I find the brush.

817
00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:34.060
- I'll have to write you up.

818
00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:36.070
- I'm not going to
clean shit with my hand.

819
00:45:36.070 --> 00:45:37.080
- Why not?

820
00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:38.423
Just so you get it done.

821
00:45:39.528 --> 00:45:41.560
- And what the hell is your problem?

822
00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:43.960
Just because I'm white.
I shouldn't live here.

823
00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:45.940
- Color ain't got anything to do with this

824
00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:48.080
it's who you are underneath.

825
00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:49.320
- And you don't know shit about me.

826
00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:52.240
- I know enough to hear how
you've been disrespecting me

827
00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:53.867
from the first day I saw you. man.

828
00:45:53.867 --> 00:45:55.860
I knew you wasn't gonna be a family. man.

829
00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:57.290
You don't care how we got

830
00:45:57.290 --> 00:45:59.070
to watch each other's backs in here.

831
00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:01.360
But that's the way it's got to be.

832
00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:02.193
If you want to make things right

833
00:46:02.193 --> 00:46:04.440
you need to apologize for what happened.

834
00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:05.588
- You're out of your mind.

835
00:46:05.588 --> 00:46:07.566
- I'm out of my mind.

836
00:46:07.566 --> 00:46:10.130
Now get into your boy shit. Roy boy.

837
00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:11.430
But I promise to make your life hell

838
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:12.920
until you save yourself.

839
00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:26.883
Roy?

840
00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:30.840
Did you hear the bad news?

841
00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:31.673
- What?

842
00:46:31.673 --> 00:46:33.410
- They're graduating me in three days

843
00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:35.173
and I have to go home on Sunday.

844
00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:42.543
And I think they're
trying to get us apart.

845
00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:47.650
I don't want to go.

846
00:46:51.313 --> 00:46:53.293
- If you go. I'm not going to stay.

847
00:46:54.944 --> 00:46:55.944
- What should we do?

848
00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:02.799
outta here.

849
00:47:02.799 --> 00:47:03.800
- You mean run away?

850
00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:04.788
- Why not?

851
00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:07.870
- If we run now. we'll get caught.

852
00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:09.320
- Well then let's go tonight.

853
00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:12.640
- No. are you sure you want to do that?

854
00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:14.923
- Absolutely. I'm sick of this place.

855
00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:18.870
- Okay. tomorrow night. okay?

856
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:21.100
I guess we'll have time to think about it.

857
00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:22.700
- Please don't change your mind.

858
00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:48.010
- So Daryl. how are you doing?
- How are doing?

859
00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:48.843
Good.

860
00:47:48.843 --> 00:47:51.200
Oh backward let's see hands.

861
00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:52.033
- Come on. Daryl.

862
00:47:52.033 --> 00:47:53.420
- Lets see them.

863
00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:54.253
Thank you.

864
00:47:54.253 --> 00:47:55.580
- Yeah. okay.

865
00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:56.460
- How was your day at work?

866
00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:58.137
- It was dirty. it was good. all right.

867
00:47:58.137 --> 00:47:59.530
You know what I'm saying. huh?

868
00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:01.033
- Okay. I'll be there with you. let's go.

869
00:48:32.915 --> 00:48:34.210
Time for you to go Lucky.

870
00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:35.547
- Have fun everybody.

871
00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:41.650
- All right family. here's the plan

872
00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:44.970
the front and backyards
both need extensive work.

873
00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:47.570
So that means everyone's
doing outside chores today.

874
00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:49.550
I know it's hot

875
00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:51.700
but we're supplying
sodas to ease the pain.

876
00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:54.360
All right now your
chores are on this list.

877
00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:56.757
Everyone gets a copy on the way out.

878
00:48:56.757 --> 00:48:57.773
Thank you family.

879
00:48:57.773 --> 00:48:59.410
Thank you. Daryl.

880
00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:00.600
- You're welcome.

881
00:49:03.195 --> 00:49:08.195

00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:11.543
- Any sign of the pigeon?
- Nothing.

883
00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:13.456
- You think there's a problem?

884
00:49:13.456 --> 00:49:15.781
- No. we just have to wait.

885
00:49:30.456 --> 00:49:31.289
- Oh my God.

886
00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:35.203
- Laura?

887
00:50:40.890 --> 00:50:41.763
Over here.

888
00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:43.483
- Where are you?

889
00:50:44.490 --> 00:50:45.323

890
00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:49.500
We still on for tonight?

- 12 o'clock. okay?

893
00:50:52.690 --> 00:50:54.490
Midnight. I'll knock on your window.

894
00:50:58.550 --> 00:51:00.190
Laura.

895
00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:01.640
- Yeah.

896
00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:03.633
- Will you tell me why you're really here?

897
00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:05.490
- What do you mean?

898
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:12.630
- I think you're hiding something.

899
00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:13.770
You know the pictures

900
00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:16.650
and well Dee said there's a lot of stuff

901
00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:17.800
about you I don't know.

902
00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:19.683
- What'd she say?

903
00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:23.520
- I'd like you to tell me.

904
00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:24.940
- Roy. it doesn't matter anymore.

905
00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:26.503
It's in the past.

906
00:51:26.503 --> 00:51:28.143
- Why can't you just tell me?

907
00:51:29.013 --> 00:51:31.188
I mean. cause then I wonder

908
00:51:31.188 --> 00:51:34.020
and it just turns into a big deal.

909
00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:38.613
- If I tell you. will you promise
not to hold it against me?

910
00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:40.563
- Of course.

911
00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:45.123
- I used to cut myself.

912
00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:47.950
- What?

913
00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:49.593
- I used to cut myself.

914
00:51:50.770 --> 00:51:54.080
- What do you mean you like
tried to kill yourself?

915
00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:57.930
- No. it's it's like a disease.

916
00:51:57.930 --> 00:52:01.030
You cut yourself whenever
you feel bad about things.

917
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:02.333
It's a compulsion.

918
00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:08.280
It's how I used to punish myself
for not being good enough.

919
00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:09.670
- And that's why you're here.

920
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:12.530
- It's not like I was crazy or anything.

921
00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:15.073
It's just that I feel bad sometimes.

922
00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:17.173
So.

923
00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:23.460
I'd take a razor and
I'd cut between my toes

924
00:52:23.650 --> 00:52:27.050
or by my ears wherever
you can't see the scars.

925
00:52:27.050 --> 00:52:28.393
but where it bleeds a lot.

926
00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:32.600
And then everybody freak out.

927
00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:35.870
I got sent to a psych
hospital a couple of times

928
00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:39.903
but whenever I came home
again. I started cutting.

929
00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:42.003
So they sent me here.

930
00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:46.130
- And now you're okay?

931
00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:47.263
- Yep.

932
00:52:51.610 --> 00:52:52.443
Are you?

933
00:52:54.930 --> 00:52:55.763
- Of course

934
00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:05.620
- DAN service.

935
00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:06.453
This is DAN.

936
00:53:10.527 --> 00:53:11.360
He did?

937
00:53:12.919 --> 00:53:14.338
- Now you're stealing from me. huh?

938
00:53:14.338 --> 00:53:15.360
- Nobody is stealing.

939
00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:16.487
- Don't you lie to me.

940
00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:20.120
- All right. everyone to their room.

941
00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:22.010
get moving.

942
00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:23.740
Come on. let's go.

943
00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:25.060
Come on family.

944
00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:25.900
- What's up?

945
00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:28.110
- Room restriction Kevin. let's go.

946
00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:29.870
Out of my face Kevin. this moment.

947
00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:30.763
Leave that here.

948
00:53:33.908 --> 00:53:34.741
- Oh.

949
00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:42.533
Shit.

950
00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:46.310
I want your attention. family.

951
00:53:46.310 --> 00:53:48.790
Dee and I are preparing a
list of all the contraband

952
00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:50.630
we found in your rooms.

953
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:52.820
Later. we'll meet with each to determine

954
00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:54.103
the bookings and LPs.

955
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:59.190
In the meantime. we're
on THS total house safety

956
00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:00.650
where you have the remainder of the day

957
00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:03.700
to organize your rooms and
think about why we need rules

958
00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:06.720
to structure our lives and keep us safe.

959
00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:08.920
I suggest you also make use of this time

960
00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:11.900
by doing a Purdue inventory
on why you're here

961
00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:15.460
and whether or not you're
taking this program seriously.

962
00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:17.225
Because if you're not.

963
00:54:17.225 --> 00:54:21.125
we can certainly give you some chance.

964
00:54:45.502 --> 00:54:46.835
- What happened?

965
00:54:48.336 --> 00:54:49.336
- It's over.

966
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:52.653
Daryl. found my screwdriver.

967
00:54:56.564 --> 00:54:57.397
I got fired.

968
00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:04.663
How do you even graduate
till I'm 18. five months.

969
00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:07.660
- And why the hell did you steal it?

970
00:55:13.401 --> 00:55:15.300
- Well. I gotta have a weapon. man.

971
00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:17.723
There's no peace without a weapon.

972
00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:24.890
- I'm running tonight with Laura.

973
00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:29.010
If you want to come.

974
00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:31.290
- Man. that's a stupid idea. man.

975
00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:32.135
They're going to catch you.

976
00:55:32.135 --> 00:55:33.682
you going to be sent
right back to the hall.

977
00:55:33.682 --> 00:55:34.660
- Hey look I'm tired of being treated

978
00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:36.340
like a piece of shit around here.

979
00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:39.350
No matter what the I do. I lose.

980
00:55:39.350 --> 00:55:41.770
Well. I'm not a loser and
I'm not going to wait around

981
00:55:41.770 --> 00:55:43.470
for them to turn me into one.

982
00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:44.440
- And you really think you gonna be able

983
00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:47.240
to hide out for two years. man. two years?

984
00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:48.860
- I don't have a choice.

985
00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:51.533
It's either run or curl up and die.

986
00:55:58.030 --> 00:55:59.103
- I don't know. man.

987
00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:04.063
This is probably the
best home I've ever had.

988
00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:07.500
I mean. I know Daryl was a pain
in the ass most of the time

989
00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:10.483
but it could be a lot worse.

990
00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:14.890
- If that's the way you feel
then why do you want out?

991
00:56:14.890 --> 00:56:15.723
- You know why?

992
00:56:15.723 --> 00:56:19.210
Because I've tried and I've
tried to adjust to this place.

993
00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:22.793
I can't. I'm a warrior.

994
00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:25.323
I know that now.

995
00:56:26.687 --> 00:56:27.523
That's who I am.

996
00:56:31.410 --> 00:56:33.830
Well. do you even
know where you're going?

997
00:56:33.830 --> 00:56:34.720
- Roy does.

998
00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:36.460
There's a cabin in the
mountains he knows about.

999
00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:37.930
So we'll stay there for awhile.

1000
00:56:37.930 --> 00:56:39.540
- You mean in the wilderness.

1001
00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:41.190
- You know. I used to think I'd be scared

1002
00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:42.700
leaving this place.

1003
00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:44.580
Now I'm just excited. you know?

1004
00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:46.740
Like I'm waking up from a bad dream

1005
00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:48.890
and I get a second chance.

1006
00:56:48.890 --> 00:56:50.800
Can't wait to get out
and start living again.

1007
00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:52.270
- You gotta be careful Laura.

1008
00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:54.930
girl it ain't so easy being on the run.

1009
00:56:54.930 --> 00:56:56.150
- We'll be okay.

1010
00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:57.183
And we like each other enough.

1011
00:56:57.183 --> 00:56:58.940
I know. things will work out.

1012
00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:01.410
- I wish it was that simple.

1013
00:57:01.410 --> 00:57:03.420
- Stop being so negative Kiwi. okay?

1014
00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:04.870
I've really good feelings about this.

1015
00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:07.114
I don't want you to bring me down.

1016
00:57:13.147 --> 00:57:16.940
- Are you sure you don't
want to change your mind.

1017
00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:19.440
- You're the one that
should be changing his mind.

1018
00:57:21.682 --> 00:57:22.780
Have you even thought
about what's gonna happen

1019
00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:24.860
to Laura if she gets caught?

1020
00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:26.240
- What do you mean?

1021
00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:29.010
- It's going to do her
time all over again.

1022
00:57:29.010 --> 00:57:30.420
You've only been here a few days. man.

1023
00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:31.960
You don't have much to lose.

1024
00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:33.210
She's got 10 months.

1025
00:57:33.210 --> 00:57:37.773
Wake up. wake up Chimera House.

1026
00:57:37.773 --> 00:57:39.730
We're out here waiting for you.

1027
00:57:39.730 --> 00:57:41.040
Hello you there.

1028
00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:41.873
- Oh shit!

1029
00:57:44.966 --> 00:57:46.163
- What the hell are you doing?

1030
00:57:47.355 --> 00:57:49.880
- I know this shit. always coming in here.

1031
00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:51.697
Today he won't get away with this.

1032
00:57:51.697 --> 00:57:53.460
- Are you crazy?

1033
00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:55.176
Lucky. don't do this.

1034
00:57:55.176 --> 00:57:57.050
- I got to do this okay?

1035
00:57:57.050 --> 00:57:57.963
Myself.

1036
00:58:00.570 --> 00:58:01.970
Daryl never needs to know.

1037
00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:14.473
- Hello?

1038
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:18.220
Yeah this is Daryl.

1039
00:58:22.170 --> 00:58:24.320
Are you sure it's one mine?

1040
00:58:27.184 --> 00:58:28.640
- What are you doing?

1041
00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:29.563
Turn it off.

1042
00:58:33.725 --> 00:58:35.483
Damn I want to sleep.

1043
00:58:51.490 --> 00:58:52.360
- God damn it Lucky.

1044
00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:55.000
How the hell am I supposed
to leave with Daryl on alert?

1045
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.800
You really fucked things up for me.

1046
00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:57.950
- It was worth it. man.

1047
00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:00.920
I got one of them real good.

1048
00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:05.110
- What the hell happened?

1049
00:59:07.650 --> 00:59:08.630
- Check this out.

1050
00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:10.000
When I got outside. right?

1051
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.710
I heard that one voice yelling
by the vacant lot. right?

1052
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:14.500
So I kept him on the
side of the house. right

1053
00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:15.610
to like I said there was three of them

1054
00:59:15.610 --> 00:59:16.827
hanging over by the fence.

1055
00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:23.050
When I got real close. I
heard them talking about.

1056
00:59:23.050 --> 00:59:25.060
came back to their group
home and stuff like that.

1057
00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:27.090
We're staff on the but we are punks

1058
00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:30.096
Edge wait. you
know what I'm saying?

1059
00:59:30.096 --> 00:59:32.530
- That's when one of them
started spray painting our fence.

1060
00:59:32.530 --> 00:59:35.222
Right then I knew it was
time for these

1061
00:59:35.222 --> 00:59:36.722
to feel some pain.

1062
00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:45.310
I've been only fucked to
one of them up though. man.

1063
00:59:45.310 --> 00:59:46.290
Cause he led to running off so fast.

1064
00:59:49.330 --> 00:59:51.039
but it was beautiful. man.

1065
00:59:51.039 --> 00:59:52.823
Beautiful.

1066
00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:56.083
Best thing I've done in this place.

1067
00:59:58.430 --> 01:00:00.430
- It's probably cause Daryl on the alert.

1068
01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:01.760
You can't expect Roy to come.

1069
01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:03.560
if he thinks he can get busted.

1070
01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:07.220
- It's not that I know it's not
that. he's changed his mind.

1071
01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:10.480
- Laura. you can't know that
you can run tomorrow night.

1072
01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:12.220
It's just not safe tonight.

1073
01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:15.220
- So stupid. I never should
have told him about the cutting.

1074
01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:19.820
He won't go now. he thinks
I'm too weird and crazy.

1075
01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:21.250
- Just stop it. Laura.

1076
01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:23.350
- It's true. in two days. I'll be back

1077
01:00:23.350 --> 01:00:27.790
with my fucked up stepdad
and nothing will have change.

1078
01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:29.213
Nothing ever changes.

1079
01:01:09.555 --> 01:01:12.305
- I want to see you in my office.

1080
01:01:14.014 --> 01:01:14.847
- Me?

1081
01:01:14.847 --> 01:01:15.907
- Now!

1082
01:01:21.027 --> 01:01:21.860
- Hey.

1083
01:01:25.009 --> 01:01:25.842
You okay?

1084
01:01:30.350 --> 01:01:31.537
Hey Daryl was on the prowl last night.

1085
01:01:31.537 --> 01:01:32.723
Can we make a new plan?

1086
01:01:36.330 --> 01:01:37.340
Laura?

1087
01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:40.330
- Look. you would have come
last night if you really wanted.

1088
01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:41.257
- What?

1089
01:01:41.257 --> 01:01:43.590
- I don't think you want
to go with me anymore.

1090
01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:45.170
- That's not true.

1091
01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:46.920
- I'm not dumb. Roy.

1092
01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:49.590
I mean. if I were you I'd
have second thoughts too.

1093
01:01:49.590 --> 01:01:51.240
- I'm not having second thoughts. I just.

1094
01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:54.030
- Come on Roy. I told
you the truth about me.

1095
01:01:54.030 --> 01:01:55.610
Just tell me the truth about you.

1096
01:01:55.610 --> 01:01:57.060
- I am telling you the truth.

1097
01:02:09.184 --> 01:02:11.650
- I need your help. man.

1098
01:02:11.650 --> 01:02:12.990
One of those Edge wood punks recognize me

1099
01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:15.110
and got word back to Daryl.

1100
01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:16.890
I'm gonna need an alibi.

1101
01:02:16.890 --> 01:02:18.240
- Like what?

1102
01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.340
- You tell him that I never left our room.

1103
01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:25.150
- Look. man. they don't
have anything on you.

1104
01:02:25.150 --> 01:02:26.950
It's your word against theirs?

1105
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:28.580
- What are you talking about?

1106
01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:29.413
Man. there was three of them out there.

1107
01:02:29.413 --> 01:02:31.220
You know that three of them

1108
01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:34.170
they are trying to charge
me with assault on this.

1109
01:02:34.170 --> 01:02:35.090
You got to do this for me. man.

1110
01:02:35.090 --> 01:02:35.923
I need you.

1111
01:02:37.395 --> 01:02:39.195
- I'm not gonna make any difference.

1112
01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:44.400
- Well. you know what
is payback time. man?

1113
01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:47.173
You remember. man. you owe me this much.

1114
01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:57.060
- I just came by to say that
lucky couldn't have done

1115
01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:58.530
what they said he did.

1116
01:02:58.530 --> 01:03:00.380
We were talking till almost midnight.

1117
01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:04.390
- This isn't about lucky
Roy. it's about you.

1118
01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:07.963
We have all the evidence
we need to get Lucky.

1119
01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:11.690
I know he's your roommate.

1120
01:03:11.690 --> 01:03:13.853
You want to help out it's commendable.

1121
01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:17.170
I admire that. but it's too late

1122
01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:20.330
but you can help yourself though.

1123
01:03:20.330 --> 01:03:23.570
Tell the truth and we'll make
sure your PO hears about it.

1124
01:03:23.570 --> 01:03:26.020
Continue lying and I'll consider
you. Lucky as accomplished.

1125
01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:29.368
And you'll be having dinner
in the hall. your choice.

1126
01:04:20.730 --> 01:04:22.130
- I brought you some dinner.

1127
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:26.213
Forget it Lucky Daryl's
sitting right outside.

1128
01:04:26.213 --> 01:04:29.123
- Fuck. I'm so fucked Laura.

1129
01:04:29.123 --> 01:04:30.853
Look I'm so screwed.

1130
01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:33.240
Can you help me out?

1131
01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:38.359
I'm such a piece of shit.

1132
01:04:38.359 --> 01:04:39.609
I'm such a piece of shit.

1133
01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:43.470
Listen to me. you got to tell Roy please.

1134
01:04:43.470 --> 01:04:45.930
No matter what Daryl
says. he's only bluffing.

1135
01:04:45.930 --> 01:04:47.373
Daryl got nothing on me.

1136
01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:49.930
You gotta tell him he's
got to stick to our story

1137
01:04:49.930 --> 01:04:51.273
no matter what. okay?

1138
01:04:51.273 --> 01:04:52.106
Laura will you do this for me.

1139
01:04:52.106 --> 01:04:55.020
You got to do this one. please. please.

1140
01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:56.760
He can't get into their bluff.

1141
01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:57.593
- I'll tell him.

1142
01:04:58.760 --> 01:04:59.980
- Because if he doesn't I'm fucked.

1143
01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:02.103
I'm so. I'm doomed.

1144
01:05:08.363 --> 01:05:09.463
Will you pray with me?

1145
01:05:20.330 --> 01:05:25.330
Lord. if you can hear me.
please. please forgive me.

1146
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:29.120
I know I've pushed a lot of
buttons and I'm truly sorry

1147
01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:32.100
but I would like just
one more chance please.

1148
01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:34.840
So if you can somehow
see it in your heart.

1149
01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:37.863
Lord get me out of here please.
Lord get us all out of here.

1150
01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.670
Lord. please give Roy
this strength he needs

1151
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:45.100
to stand up Daryl and Dee
don't let him back down

1152
01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:46.633
or fall for their tricks.

1153
01:05:48.919 --> 01:05:52.243
I'm just asking for one chance
Lord. just one chance please.

1154
01:05:53.551 --> 01:05:55.592
I promise. I promise.

1155
01:05:55.592 --> 01:05:57.242
- It's time for you to go. Laura.

1156
01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:04.590
- Good luck. Lucky.

1157
01:06:13.450 --> 01:06:15.669
Don't sweat
out in this house please.

1158
01:06:15.669 --> 01:06:16.768
what are you drinking?

1159
01:06:16.768 --> 01:06:18.800
You're always drinking.
- Oh shut up!

1160
01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:20.637
- Stop.
- Shut up right now!

1161
01:06:21.907 --> 01:06:23.740
I'm sick of bullshit.

1162
01:06:24.919 --> 01:06:26.617
- Don't touch me.
- Damn ass.

1163
01:06:26.617 --> 01:06:28.999
- Don't touch me.
- Fuck damn it. shut up.

1164
01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:52.171
- Hey. anyone going there
outside. will be arrested

1165
01:06:52.171 --> 01:06:53.240
and thrown to the hall.

1166
01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:54.398
No. I said.

1167
01:06:54.398 --> 01:06:56.647
- This is war Daryl. we have
the right to defend our home.

1168
01:06:56.647 --> 01:06:58.939
- Did you hear what I
said put down the stick

1169
01:06:58.939 --> 01:07:01.733
and go to your room. now!

1170
01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:07.013
Oh there.

1171
01:07:11.490 --> 01:07:12.940
- This is an emergency.

1172
01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:14.193
We need the police.

1173
01:07:15.091 --> 01:07:17.015
- Laura get away from there.

1174
01:07:17.015 --> 01:07:18.974
get away from that window.

1175
01:07:18.974 --> 01:07:20.160
- Come on run. Roy let's go.

1176
01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:21.100
- Where are we going?

1177
01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:22.630
- Lets run while they're distracted.

1178
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:23.930
- Wait a minute.

1179
01:07:23.930 --> 01:07:25.170
- What do you mean?

1180
01:07:25.170 --> 01:07:26.083
You said you wanted to go?

1181
01:07:26.083 --> 01:07:27.430
- I do. but listen.

1182
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:29.100
okay tomorrow you're graduating.

1183
01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:29.933
You'll be legal.

1184
01:07:29.933 --> 01:07:30.860
Let's wait a couple of days.

1185
01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:33.080
I'll meet you at your dad's
place and we'll go from there.

1186
01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:33.913
- That's stupid.

1187
01:07:33.913 --> 01:07:36.030
If you really want to do it. let's go now.

1188
01:07:36.030 --> 01:07:37.780
- It's better for you with me. wait.

1189
01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:38.910
- No that's not the point. Roy

1190
01:07:38.910 --> 01:07:40.510
we're not going to get another chance.

1191
01:07:40.510 --> 01:07:41.343
- Yes we will Laura.

1192
01:07:41.343 --> 01:07:42.600
if we don't get caught
up in all of this shit.

1193
01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.633
- Come on it's now or never.

1194
01:07:44.633 --> 01:07:46.510
- Laura. Roy?

1195
01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:49.225
- Okay Laura. I promise
in a couple of days.

1196
01:07:58.945 --> 01:08:01.718
- Hey come on Prax. open the door. man.

1197
01:08:01.718 --> 01:08:04.801
- Hey come on. we're getting you out.

1198
01:08:09.346 --> 01:08:11.945
- I'll take care of it.
please can you hear me?

1199
01:08:11.945 --> 01:08:13.238
I'll take care of it.

1200
01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:30.440
- Roy. where's Laura at?

1201
01:08:32.777 --> 01:08:34.613
- I don't know what the
fuck's going on with her.

1202
01:09:07.381 --> 01:09:09.048
- Don't do this. man

1203
01:09:12.510 --> 01:09:14.900
Laura open up the door girl.

1204
01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:16.590
- Go away leave me alone.

1205
01:09:16.590 --> 01:09:19.643
Open it up girl.
it's Kiwi. just let me in.

1206
01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:21.353
Laura?

1207
01:09:21.353 --> 01:09:25.610
- And you shit you destroy
everything. I hate you.

1208
01:09:27.164 --> 01:09:28.081
I hate you.

1209
01:09:31.930 --> 01:09:35.103
- Laura. don't do anything stupid.

1210
01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:38.463
Please. Laura.

1211
01:09:40.290 --> 01:09:44.170
There is a lot of crazy
shit going on out there

1212
01:09:44.170 --> 01:09:47.003
and it's making us all feel real bad.

1213
01:09:48.370 --> 01:09:50.784
but girl it ain't about us.

1214
01:09:50.784 --> 01:09:51.617
- Don't!

1215
01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:56.820
- We promised to help
each other out. remember

1216
01:09:56.820 --> 01:09:58.760
if the ghosts ever came back

1217
01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:02.913
we said that we would
be there for each other.

1218
01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:07.410
Can we just talk about
this for a minute girl?

1219
01:10:07.410 --> 01:10:08.810
- It won't make any difference.

1220
01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:10.030
- Yeah. it will.

1221
01:10:10.030 --> 01:10:13.090
It'll make a big difference
if we don't give it up.

1222
01:10:13.090 --> 01:10:15.420
- No. not for me. it won't.

1223
01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:17.187
- Laura girl. I care about you.

1224
01:10:17.187 --> 01:10:19.450
- You're the only one.

1225
01:10:19.450 --> 01:10:21.690
- That's not true I just seen Roy outside

1226
01:10:21.690 --> 01:10:24.809
and he's real worried about you.

1227
01:10:24.809 --> 01:10:25.973
- I don't believe you.

1228
01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:30.180
- You're putting an awful
lot of pressure on yourself.

1229
01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:33.600
Give it some time.

1230
01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:35.850
- Is it any time?

1231
01:10:35.850 --> 01:10:39.050
- Can I tell you what I
do when I feel hopeless?

1232
01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:41.610
I tell myself that for one
day I'm going to pretend

1233
01:10:41.610 --> 01:10:44.420
to feel positive and
hopeful and I for one day.

1234
01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:46.120
I'll pretend to be somebody

1235
01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:49.143
who really expects
something good to happen.

1236
01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:53.563
- What happens?

1237
01:10:55.090 --> 01:10:56.393
- Things get better.

1238
01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:00.890
It's true. at least give it a try Laura.

1239
01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:02.923
Cause girl. if you cut yourself.

1240
01:11:03.873 --> 01:11:05.520
they're going to send you away

1241
01:11:06.410 --> 01:11:07.980

1259
01:12:02.326 --> 01:12:04.177
- Oh you're ready. you're ready?

1260
01:12:04.177 --> 01:12:06.039
One two three.

1261
01:12:18.750 --> 01:12:20.160
- You're doing okay.

1262
01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:20.993
- I'm good.

1263
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:23.950
Did you tell Daryl anything?

1264
01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:26.733
- No.

1265
01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:30.730
- You weren't going to back down.

1266
01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:36.160
- Okay. it doesn't matter anymore. okay?

1267
01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:38.369
So let's just not talk about it.

1268
01:12:38.369 --> 01:12:40.380
- I need to know man.

1269
01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:41.880
It's important.

1270
01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:44.200
- Look. I don't know what
I was going to do. okay?

1271
01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:45.740
But I wasn't willing to
go to the hall for you.

1272
01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:47.870
That's too much to ask.

1273
01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:50.863
- He's only bluffing.
he had nothing on me.

1274
01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:54.520
- It doesn't matter anymore. Lucky.

1275
01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:55.353
- Believe it.

1276
01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:58.043
You were going to fall for his shit.

1277
01:12:59.293 --> 01:13:00.763
And I risked my neck for you.

1278
01:13:04.810 --> 01:13:06.130
- Get yourself together.

1279
01:13:06.130 --> 01:13:06.963
Let's go.

1280
01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:11.790
- What about him?

1281
01:13:11.790 --> 01:13:12.930
He's all right.

1282
01:13:12.930 --> 01:13:15.070
You're under
arrest for assault.

1283
01:13:15.070 --> 01:13:16.870
You have the right to remain silent.

1284
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:24.213
- Seem kinda lonely around here. huh?

1285
01:13:37.210 --> 01:13:38.240

1288
01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:50.563
- Well. here we are survivors
from the night of hell.

- He's pretty messed up.

1291
01:13:55.227 --> 01:13:57.127
I didn't show that to the cops though.

1292
01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:02.280
So how are you?

1293
01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:05.453
- Okay I guess. I'm
supposed to graduate today.

1294
01:14:07.050 --> 01:14:07.883
- What time?

1295
01:14:07.883 --> 01:14:10.460

1296
01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:12.200

Because in a couple of days
I'll be giving you a call.

1299
01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:19.360

- That's the plan. you still want to go?

1301
01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:25.293
- I don't know. things got
pretty screwed up. didn't they?.

1302
01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:33.760
- Listen Laura. I don't think
I'm ever going to graduate

1303
01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:34.913
from this place.

1304
01:14:36.030 --> 01:14:38.936
I mean. look. what
happened to all of them.

- We have some important news for you.

1308
01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:12.400
There's going to be an investigation

1309
01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:14.600
and we're closing the
house until it's over.

1310
01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:17.650
- What does that mean?

1311
01:15:18.970 --> 01:15:21.420
- Well. it means that Laura
would graduate as scheduled

1312
01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:25.830
and Keisha will be moved
to a group home in Texas.

1313
01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:26.843
- What about me.

1314
01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:30.680
- It means you're going back to the hall.

1315
01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:31.670
- That's not fair.

1316
01:15:31.670 --> 01:15:33.530
- You can't do that. I
haven't broken any rules.

1317
01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:36.530
- Things don't always work out
the way we want them to. Roy.

1318
01:15:38.107 --> 01:15:39.467
Oh. I'm sorry. son.
