6
00:00:41.233 --> 00:00:42.333
Good morning. sis.

7
00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:44.700
You do know that mornings

8
00:00:44.834 --> 00:00:46.300
are the worst time
to call me. right?

9
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.400
I'm trying to plan
mom's big birthday

10
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:51.233
and I need your help.
- Mom's big...

11
00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:52.567
She's turning 59.

12
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.967
But she refuses
to have a 60th.

13
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.367
so we have to do a big 59.

14
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.533
Okay. Can I call you later?

15
00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:01.533
What's been going on with
that guy you were seeing?

16
00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:03.133
Eric.

17
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:05.266
Okay. Okay. Janelle. I
can't do this right now. okay?

18
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.000
I love you.

19
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.467
Bye.

20
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.767
Call Peter the doorman.

21
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.000
Pete. it's Jade Taylor.

22
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.300
Forgot to tell
you on my way out.

23
00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:16.433
my ex is stopping by
to pick up his things.

24
00:01:16.567 --> 00:01:18.533
We have an agreement.
half an hour. no more.

25
00:01:18.667 --> 00:01:20.433
If that's a problem.
let me know. Thank you.

26
00:01:20.567 --> 00:01:21.367
There you are.

27
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.767
The congresswoman's
office just called.

28
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.000
She's coming over now
for the interview.

29
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:24.834
What? Now?

30
00:01:24.967 --> 00:01:26.467
Yes. now.

31
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.300
She's been called back to
DC for an emergency session

32
00:01:28.433 --> 00:01:30.033
so she's stopping by on
the way to the airport.

33
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:31.667
Okay. Prep studio
three for filming.

34
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.300
Studio three's on the air.

35
00:01:33.433 --> 00:01:35.333
- Studio two.
- On the air.

36
00:01:35.467 --> 00:01:36.467
Studio one?

37
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.533
- On the air.
- On the air?

38
00:01:37.667 --> 00:01:39.166
Okay. get two field
cameras and lighting set up

39
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.500
on the 11th floor
conference room.

40
00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:41.834
We do this remote.

41
00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:42.800
Remote from
the CNB Headquarters?

42
00:01:42.934 --> 00:01:43.433
- Mm-hm.
- Got it.

43
00:01:43.567 --> 00:01:45.300
Oh. here. How are you?

44
00:01:45.433 --> 00:01:46.166
Has he called?

45
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.433
La rata.

46
00:01:47.567 --> 00:01:48.433
Should I ask?

47
00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:49.867
Okay. I'm fine. Don't worry.

48
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.467
You're not fine.
No one could be fine.

49
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.000
People break up all
the time. you know.

50
00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:55.500
Yeah. but not like this.

51
00:01:55.633 --> 00:01:58.800
He said he loved you. moved
in. which is huge for you.

52
00:01:58.934 --> 00:02:00.266
And then-
- I can't do this right now.

53
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.533
The Congresswoman is coming.

54
00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:02.900
The Congresswoman?

55
00:02:03.033 --> 00:02:04.400
The Congresswoman.

56
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.333
That's good. That's good. Ted.

57
00:02:06.467 --> 00:02:09.033
And now just clarify.
what year was that?

58
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.133
What year was that. exactly?

59
00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:13.567
That
would've been January 2014.

60
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.367
2014. okay.

61
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.600
And you were at the time

62
00:02:15.734 --> 00:02:17.500
an assistant DA in
your current district?

63
00:02:17.633 --> 00:02:18.767
The amount of
information being leaked

64
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.333
brings to mind the
scandal that hit

65
00:02:21.467 --> 00:02:24.233
the New Jersey DA's
office a few years back.

66
00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:25.333
What are your thoughts on that

67
00:02:25.467 --> 00:02:28.533
and where do you think
these leaks are coming from?

68
00:02:28.667 --> 00:02:30.333
The amount of
information being leaked

69
00:02:30.467 --> 00:02:32.000
brings to mind the
scandal that hit

70
00:02:32.133 --> 00:02:35.066
the New Jersey DA's
office a few years back.

71
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.133
What are your thoughts on that

72
00:02:36.266 --> 00:02:38.367
and where do you think
the leaks are coming from?

73
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.000
Ted. I can't comment

74
00:02:40.133 --> 00:02:42.367
on an open case. you know that.

75
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.066
But what I can say
is that I can promise

76
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.333
that we will be taking
appropriate action

77
00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:49.433
pending the investigation.

78
00:02:49.567 --> 00:02:51.400
But don't you think
the public deserves to know

79
00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:53.533
what happened and
who was involved?

80
00:02:53.667 --> 00:02:56.433
I mean. these people are
paid with tax payer dollars.

81
00:02:57.967 --> 00:02:59.333
The
public will know the truth

82
00:02:59.467 --> 00:03:00.667
as soon as we do. Ted.

83
00:03:03.567 --> 00:03:04.767
So what you're
saying is you never

84
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.033
really loved me in
the first place. hm?

85
00:03:08.233 --> 00:03:09.400
So what you're
saying is you never

86
00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:11.400
really loved me in
the first place.

87
00:03:11.533 --> 00:03:12.467
No. No!

88
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.133
Let me rephrase the question.

89
00:03:18.367 --> 00:03:21.567
Look. I started
you here as an intern

90
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.133
and you were living
with seven roommates

91
00:03:23.266 --> 00:03:25.400
doing coffee runs and
editing puff pieces.

92
00:03:25.533 --> 00:03:28.600
You're now one of our
most valued news producers

93
00:03:28.734 --> 00:03:31.467
and if what just happened
had happened to anyone else.

94
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.834
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

95
00:03:32.967 --> 00:03:36.433
Again. I am so sorry.

96
00:03:36.567 --> 00:03:38.667
We've known each
other a long time Jade.

97
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.233
and I know you going
through a breakup.

98
00:03:42.367 --> 00:03:44.600
The truth is. I'm almost
glad this has happened

99
00:03:44.734 --> 00:03:46.567
because I need you. Jade.

100
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.633
And I'm worried your next
step is about to be burnout.

101
00:03:50.467 --> 00:03:53.133
You've worked so
hard to get here.

102
00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:56.567
but now you need
to take a breath

103
00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.800
and the network wants you
to take a leave of absence

104
00:03:59.934 --> 00:04:01.767
and that doesn't
mean work from home.

105
00:04:04.967 --> 00:04:07.166
Well. I do have
a ridiculous amount

106
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.600
of vacation time racked up.

107
00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:12.233
I'll come back fresh.

108
00:04:12.367 --> 00:04:15.667
I'll show the top floor
who I am. what I can do.

109
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.700
You're going to
need to do just that.

110
00:04:23.767 --> 00:04:25.000
What happened?

111
00:04:25.133 --> 00:04:26.266
We're going for a drink.

112
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.667
Book me someplace
chic and quiet. make
sure there's a beach.

113
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.734
Looks like I'm
going on vacation.

114
00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:17.367
Excuse me.

115
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.600
Is there a supermarket
around here?

116
00:05:19.734 --> 00:05:21.967
Yes. ma'am we have a market.

117
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.467
Great.

118
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.467
Uh. this is it?

119
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.266
You don't have anything bigger?

120
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.467
This is it.

121
00:05:45.166 --> 00:05:46.266
I'll be quick. then.

122
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.000
Where's your frozen
food section?

123
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.834
New York.

124
00:06:19.667 --> 00:06:20.467
Ah.

125
00:06:24.734 --> 00:06:26.300
Ah. well. this is it.

126
00:06:36.734 --> 00:06:37.500
Okay.

127
00:06:39.266 --> 00:06:43.800
Keys under the
mat as instructed.

128
00:07:24.367 --> 00:07:25.133
Okay.

129
00:07:37.467 --> 00:07:40.800
I bet things are falling
apart without me.

130
00:07:44.567 --> 00:07:45.367
Hm.

131
00:07:48.834 --> 00:07:50.166
And also. I don't want
anyone besides you

132
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.266
covering the Johnson case.

133
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.567
He's evasive.

134
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.400
You have to stay on him.

135
00:07:54.533 --> 00:07:55.567
Keep an eye out for Peter.

136
00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.867
I know he's gonna wanna
steal that art scandal story.

137
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.800
That is ours. and that's how
I'm gonna get back on track.

138
00:08:02.934 --> 00:08:03.967
What else?

139
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.266
Jade. what are you doing?

140
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.133
Turn it off.

141
00:08:06.266 --> 00:08:07.767
You're on vacation.

142
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.800
You should be at a
beach bar or stargazing.

143
00:08:10.934 --> 00:08:13.033
Start a shell
collection. anything.

144
00:08:14.066 --> 00:08:18.000
Stop. I am fine. and I'm
perfectly capable of relaxing.

145
00:08:19.033 --> 00:08:22.133
Matter of fact. I'm
going to relax right now.

146
00:08:23.533 --> 00:08:24.400
Good night.

147
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:21.900
What was that?

148
00:09:37.367 --> 00:09:40.800
Who put
that chair there?

149
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.467
Hold it.

150
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.700
Hold it right there.

151
00:09:43.834 --> 00:09:46.200
Who are you. and what
are you doing here?

152
00:09:46.333 --> 00:09:47.867
And what have you
done to my furniture?

153
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Huh?

154
00:09:49.133 --> 00:09:50.000
Excuse me? Who are you?

155
00:09:50.133 --> 00:09:52.367
This is my house. I live here.

156
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.667
What?

157
00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.867
Well. not for the next
two weeks you don't.

158
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.500
What are you talking about?

159
00:09:57.633 --> 00:09:59.834
And put. put my lamp down.

160
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.834
I rented this place. or
rather my assistant did

161
00:10:05.967 --> 00:10:06.967
on Luxury Away.

162
00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.100
Look.

163
00:10:08.233 --> 00:10:11.000
This is my confirmation
and the instructions. Here.

164
00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.367
Well. I am sorry to be
the one to tell you this.

165
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.800
but you have been
properly scammed.

166
00:10:19.934 --> 00:10:21.266
This place is not for rent.

167
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.133
They said that the keys
would be under the mat

168
00:10:24.266 --> 00:10:25.567
and the keys were under the mat.

169
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.633
so why would you do that?

170
00:10:27.767 --> 00:10:28.800
Well that's where
I'll leave them

171
00:10:28.934 --> 00:10:30.667
because this is Maceo Island.

172
00:10:32.033 --> 00:10:33.633
But I. but I paid
and then they...

173
00:10:33.767 --> 00:10:36.667
Look. I'm Ford. it's late.

174
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.500
Clearly you have a situation.
but I'm going to bed.

175
00:10:43.934 --> 00:10:46.700
You can crash here in the
extra bedroom until the morning

176
00:10:46.834 --> 00:10:47.967
when you find something.

177
00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.200
No. thanks. Thanks
but no thanks.

178
00:10:49.333 --> 00:10:50.967
I'm not staying at
a stranger's house.

179
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.867
Well. you already are.

180
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.967
And the bedroom door locks.

181
00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:56.233
Plus you rearranged
my furniture.

182
00:10:56.367 --> 00:10:57.533
Yeah. sorry about that.

183
00:10:57.667 --> 00:11:00.233
but yeah. I'm still not staying.

184
00:11:00.367 --> 00:11:02.734
Well I'm not
exactly begging you.

185
00:11:02.867 --> 00:11:04.033
Look. I'm gonna go to bed

186
00:11:04.166 --> 00:11:05.600
and pretend that
this never happened.

187
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.233
Okay. go on.

188
00:11:09.433 --> 00:11:10.567
Don't worry about me.

189
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.000
New York.

190
00:11:55.166 --> 00:11:56.133
Morning.

191
00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.166
No room at the inn?

192
00:12:00.967 --> 00:12:02.133
I've checked everything.

193
00:12:02.266 --> 00:12:07.133
It's a small island.
so everything's booked.

194
00:12:07.934 --> 00:12:09.967
Well. little under
the radar island

195
00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.266
is not exactly the
best place to look

196
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.233
for a last minute
reservation. so.

197
00:12:14.967 --> 00:12:15.867
Right.

198
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Well. I'll get out of your way

199
00:12:17.133 --> 00:12:19.266
since it's morning and I'll
put your furniture back

200
00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.000
where I found it. okay?

201
00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.467
Thank you.

202
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.133
Sure.

203
00:12:25.266 --> 00:12:26.266
I really think this chair
works right here. though.

204
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.600
You should consider it.

205
00:12:27.734 --> 00:12:29.266
Thank you. I like
it where I have it.

206
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.734
It's just a suggestion.

207
00:12:35.233 --> 00:12:37.066
No. please. just...

208
00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.000
This place is amazing.

209
00:12:41.133 --> 00:12:42.000
What is it that you do?

210
00:12:42.133 --> 00:12:43.300
I'm not rich or anything.

211
00:12:43.433 --> 00:12:46.500
but it's easy to live
a better life here.

212
00:12:46.633 --> 00:12:47.834
Well. I actually
didn't wanna come here

213
00:12:47.967 --> 00:12:49.133
in the first place.

214
00:12:49.266 --> 00:12:52.133
I was literally forced
to take a vacation.

215
00:12:52.266 --> 00:12:53.934
if you can believe it.

216
00:12:54.066 --> 00:12:54.700
Literally?

217
00:12:54.834 --> 00:12:55.633
Literally. yes.

218
00:12:55.767 --> 00:12:57.767
Well. a leave of absence.

219
00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.600
The vacation was my idea.

220
00:12:59.734 --> 00:13:03.000
'cause apparently I
don't know how to relax.

221
00:13:03.133 --> 00:13:04.100
You don't say.

222
00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.500
Well. that's what everyone
keeps telling me. so.

223
00:13:08.633 --> 00:13:10.000
Hm.

224
00:13:10.133 --> 00:13:11.166
You know. I was thinking
this painting. it-

225
00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:12.300
No.

226
00:13:18.367 --> 00:13:20.367
It's one thing to
have a bad vacation.

227
00:13:21.367 --> 00:13:23.066
it's another to pack up.
come all the way here

228
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.734
and have no vacation at all.

229
00:13:25.734 --> 00:13:27.734
Make that make sense.

230
00:13:27.867 --> 00:13:30.033
So it's back to
the airport for me.

231
00:13:30.166 --> 00:13:32.133
Do you know what time
the water taxis start?

232
00:13:33.734 --> 00:13:35.333
Look. I...

233
00:13:35.467 --> 00:13:39.066
I really hope I don't regret
this. but we are both adults.

234
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.066
This place is. it's pretty
big. It's got two bathrooms.

235
00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:46.867
If you can keep to yourself and
not bother me. you can stay.

236
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.066
But only until
something else opens up

237
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.200
and I'm not your host. okay?

238
00:13:50.333 --> 00:13:52.266
I'm not gonna be your tour
guide or anything like that.

239
00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.600
No. I didn't think
that. but thank you.

240
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.266
You gonna stay or what?

241
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.066
Look. here.

242
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.734
All right. whatever you decide.

243
00:14:02.867 --> 00:14:04.567
if you decide to head out.
just go ahead and lock up

244
00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.467
and leave the key
under the mat. okay?

245
00:14:17.233 --> 00:14:18.900
Hey.

246
00:14:19.033 --> 00:14:19.667
Don't touch.

247
00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:20.600
Sorry.

248
00:14:32.734 --> 00:14:34.467
I can't believe I'm
doing this. Courtney.

249
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.834
I'm staying with a
complete stranger.

250
00:14:36.967 --> 00:14:39.734
I can't believe a
stranger is letting you stay.

251
00:14:39.867 --> 00:14:42.066
Well. he seems all right.

252
00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.900
Little bit familiar. but
you know I won't be seeing

253
00:14:44.033 --> 00:14:47.600
much of him anyway 'cause
now I've got something to do.

254
00:14:47.734 --> 00:14:48.934
What do you mean?

255
00:14:49.066 --> 00:14:49.967
What do you mean.
"what do you mean?"

256
00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:51.834
This is a great story.

257
00:14:51.967 --> 00:14:54.233
Have Gabby send me
everything that she can find

258
00:14:54.367 --> 00:14:56.633
on vacation rental scams

259
00:14:56.767 --> 00:15:01.166
and run a background check
on these Luxury Way people.

260
00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.166
Boy are they gonna be sorry.

261
00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:04.867
I guess it's
futile to remind you

262
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.900
that you are on vacation.

263
00:15:07.033 --> 00:15:08.400
Excuse me. have we met?

264
00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:10.000
I have been scammed.

265
00:15:10.133 --> 00:15:13.166
I'm not gonna get a pina
colada and sit on the beach.

266
00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.700
I'm gonna get to
the bottom of this.

267
00:15:14.834 --> 00:15:15.967
Of course you are.

268
00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.333
- See ya.
- Bye.

269
00:15:24.367 --> 00:15:25.667
What is up with the goat?

270
00:15:29.333 --> 00:15:31.333
Okay. how hard can it be?

271
00:15:49.433 --> 00:15:50.467
Ooh!

272
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.367
Here we go.

273
00:16:04.033 --> 00:16:04.800
Wow.

274
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.200
Lady. wrong
side. Wrong side.

275
00:16:10.333 --> 00:16:12.000
Oh. Sorry!

276
00:16:20.333 --> 00:16:21.300
Hello again.

277
00:16:21.433 --> 00:16:23.467
Could you tell me where
the police station is?

278
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.033
Oh. hi.

279
00:16:31.166 --> 00:16:32.934
I would like to report a crime.

280
00:16:33.066 --> 00:16:34.200
- A crime?
- Yes.

281
00:16:34.333 --> 00:16:35.433
What kind of crime?

282
00:16:35.567 --> 00:16:36.900
I was scammed.

283
00:16:37.033 --> 00:16:38.133
By who?

284
00:16:38.266 --> 00:16:39.734
I don't know.
That's why I'm here.

285
00:16:40.867 --> 00:16:42.300
Okay.

286
00:16:42.433 --> 00:16:44.700
My assistant rented this
place for me from Luxury Away.

287
00:16:44.834 --> 00:16:47.433
I don't know if they've done
that to anyone here before.

288
00:16:47.567 --> 00:16:50.300
I mean. does this
happen a lot here?

289
00:16:50.433 --> 00:16:51.734
No.

290
00:16:51.867 --> 00:16:53.400
Mm-hm. mm-hm. and
what about this guy?

291
00:16:53.533 --> 00:16:54.967
Says his name is Ford.

292
00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.600
American. Says it's his place.

293
00:16:57.734 --> 00:16:59.233
Has it happened there before?

294
00:16:59.367 --> 00:17:00.600
No.

295
00:17:00.734 --> 00:17:02.300
I would like to get
to the bottom of it.

296
00:17:02.433 --> 00:17:03.834
Okay.

297
00:17:03.967 --> 00:17:06.200
Are you gonna. are
you gonna file a report?

298
00:17:09.133 --> 00:17:10.633
I'll go back to the
station and get that form.

299
00:17:10.767 --> 00:17:12.166
I'll be back in 10 to 15.

300
00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.000
Okay. I will meet
you right here.

301
00:17:23.633 --> 00:17:27.834
We can do this.

302
00:17:27.967 --> 00:17:29.633
-  Ford.
- Yep?

303
00:17:29.767 --> 00:17:31.800
Do you have some
lady staying with you?

304
00:17:33.734 --> 00:17:35.467
Yep.

305
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.433
Is she all right?

306
00:17:37.567 --> 00:17:38.567
I have no idea.

307
00:17:42.567 --> 00:17:43.867
I should have trusted my gun.

308
00:17:45.567 --> 00:17:47.500
Well. you are the one
who asked her to stay.

309
00:17:47.633 --> 00:17:49.300
Yeah well. she got scammed.

310
00:17:49.433 --> 00:17:50.367
I felt bad for her.

311
00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.400
And here she comes.

312
00:17:58.133 --> 00:17:58.900
Hey. what's up?

313
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.133
This is your shop?

314
00:18:02.467 --> 00:18:03.100
Yeah.

315
00:18:03.233 --> 00:18:04.033
It's nice.

316
00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.200
So about this scam...

317
00:18:08.333 --> 00:18:10.533
I know everyone on the island
and no one here scammed you.

318
00:18:10.667 --> 00:18:12.066
I mean whoever did it is
somewhere far. far away

319
00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.367
across the vast ocean
someplace so my advice to you?

320
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.567
Let it go.

321
00:18:20.033 --> 00:18:22.100
This is Hughes. my friend.

322
00:18:22.233 --> 00:18:23.100
Good morning.

323
00:18:23.233 --> 00:18:25.033
It's nice to meet you.

324
00:18:25.166 --> 00:18:26.567
I take it you're staying?

325
00:18:27.867 --> 00:18:28.867
Well yes.

326
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.800
Like I said. I'm here to relax.

327
00:18:32.834 --> 00:18:34.033
Hmm.

328
00:18:34.166 --> 00:18:34.934
Well lucky me.

329
00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.200
Goodbye.

330
00:18:37.333 --> 00:18:39.066
See you later.

331
00:18:48.533 --> 00:18:51.266
Mm. potentially
linked. you guys.

332
00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.433
Mr. Ford?

333
00:18:55.667 --> 00:18:57.066
Good morning!

334
00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.000
Hi.

335
00:18:58.133 --> 00:18:59.567
Are you Ford's girlfriend?

336
00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.333
No.

337
00:19:02.467 --> 00:19:04.266
Well. can you
tell him for tonight

338
00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.934
three for McPherson.
two for Ferguson?

339
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.333
Three and two what?

340
00:19:11.467 --> 00:19:12.166
He'll know.

341
00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.467
Have a nice day.

342
00:19:18.767 --> 00:19:23.767
Three and two for Ferguson?

343
00:19:24.533 --> 00:19:24.934
I don't know.

344
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.133
Hey. how's it going?

345
00:19:32.266 --> 00:19:34.166
Take down an illegal
daiquiri cart?

346
00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:36.567
Bootleg sun tan lotion gang?

347
00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:39.500
Very funny. I am
trying to relax.

348
00:19:40.166 --> 00:19:41.667
Good morning lady.

349
00:19:42.934 --> 00:19:43.600
Oh hi.

350
00:19:43.734 --> 00:19:44.767
You Ford's girlfriend?

351
00:19:45.867 --> 00:19:47.066
No.

352
00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.200
Oh. okay.

353
00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.266
This bag is from my mom.

354
00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.900
She said to tell Ford
three for Phillips.

355
00:19:55.033 --> 00:19:55.767
Bye.

356
00:19:57.266 --> 00:19:58.033
Bye.

357
00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:02.633
Three...

358
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.467
I don't know. this house is
getting a lot of traffic.

359
00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.333
I feel like something's
going on here.

360
00:20:08.467 --> 00:20:10.767
Maybe I should look
further into this Ford guy.

361
00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.700
I mean. I am staying with him.

362
00:20:13.734 --> 00:20:15.900
What? The guy's guilty
of having a social life?

363
00:20:16.033 --> 00:20:18.266
Look. I am begging
you. go find a hammock

364
00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.500
and a bottle of rosé.

365
00:20:20.633 --> 00:20:22.567
It's Jade on the
phone. She's relaxing.

366
00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:28.433
Why does everyone think this
is so funny? I am relaxing.

367
00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.166
Bye.

368
00:20:47.467 --> 00:20:50.467
So you're really embracing
the island life. I see.

369
00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:51.433
Mm.

370
00:20:51.567 --> 00:20:52.533
Mm-hm.

371
00:20:53.567 --> 00:20:54.967
You have a list.

372
00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.934
McPherson. Ferguson. Phillips.

373
00:20:58.066 --> 00:20:59.100
Three. two and three.

374
00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.834
You know. there's a
Lo Lo down the street.

375
00:21:04.967 --> 00:21:06.033
What's a Lo Lo?

376
00:21:06.166 --> 00:21:07.000
Just a local spot.

377
00:21:07.133 --> 00:21:09.633
It's like big drum grills.

378
00:21:09.767 --> 00:21:12.033
barbecue chicken. curried
chicken. grilled prawns.

379
00:21:12.166 --> 00:21:16.033
It's delicious. not like that
chemical bomb you're eating.

380
00:21:16.166 --> 00:21:17.367
My food is delicious.

381
00:21:18.667 --> 00:21:19.700
Sure.

382
00:21:21.767 --> 00:21:23.000
Big plans?

383
00:21:23.133 --> 00:21:24.567
Just meeting friends.

384
00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:27.633
Why. you wanna come?

385
00:21:27.767 --> 00:21:28.400
Oh. no.

386
00:21:28.533 --> 00:21:29.533
I'm okay. Thank you.

387
00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.867
All right. Well.
uh. you enjoy it.

388
00:22:02.734 --> 00:22:03.467
Hey.

389
00:22:13.433 --> 00:22:15.767
What are you doing?

390
00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:18.300
- What are you doing?
- No. what are you doing?

391
00:22:18.433 --> 00:22:20.967
Oh. well I was looking
for the Lo Lo place.

392
00:22:23.367 --> 00:22:24.133
Follow me.

393
00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.567
ic)

394
00:22:36.567 --> 00:22:37.967
Oh. look what I found.

395
00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:38.934
Hey.

396
00:22:39.066 --> 00:22:39.700
Hi Jade.

397
00:22:39.834 --> 00:22:41.467
Hi.

398
00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.266
What are those?

399
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.200
These are Johnnycakes.

400
00:22:44.333 --> 00:22:46.033
Big thing here in
this island. you see.

401
00:22:46.166 --> 00:22:47.700
Mine are the best.

402
00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.800
I got the recipe off my
great Aunt Eda one evening

403
00:22:50.934 --> 00:22:52.567
after she had too
much rum punch.

404
00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:56.300
Yeah. it's his parents'
40th wedding anniversary.

405
00:22:57.834 --> 00:23:01.967
Oh. the numbers were RSVPs.

406
00:23:03.867 --> 00:23:06.100
How many people
are coming. Right.

407
00:23:06.233 --> 00:23:08.533
Oh. amazingly. it's
still a surprise.

408
00:23:08.667 --> 00:23:10.767
That's the downside of
living on a small island.

409
00:23:11.834 --> 00:23:12.767
You should join us.

410
00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:17.033
Look. I know I
said that I wasn't

411
00:23:17.166 --> 00:23:18.967
gonna be your tour
guide. but. uh.

412
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.233
if you really came here to relax

413
00:23:21.367 --> 00:23:23.400
then you gotta go full island.

414
00:23:25.834 --> 00:23:27.033
Hm? Yes or no?

415
00:23:27.166 --> 00:23:27.800
We gotta get this
done before night

416
00:23:27.934 --> 00:23:30.200
when our guests of honor arrive.

417
00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.100
Yeah. I'm down.

418
00:23:34.233 --> 00:23:35.867
Let's do it.

419
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:36.700
Ooh.

420
00:23:36.834 --> 00:23:37.600
Okay.

421
00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.033
You sure these things work?

422
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.433
Not bad. eh?

423
00:23:50.567 --> 00:23:54.367
You two. I cannot believe
you planned all this.

424
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:57.467
Of course. It's my parents'
anniversary. I'm their son.

425
00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:00.133
One second

426
00:24:06.567 --> 00:24:07.300
Jade.

427
00:24:07.433 --> 00:24:08.066
Hm?

428
00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.066
Put the phone away.

429
00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.800
Come on. it's time to party.

430
00:24:11.934 --> 00:24:12.767
Right.

431
00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:13.667
Thank you.

432
00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:16.934
- Yeah?
- Yes.

433
00:24:19.934 --> 00:24:21.133
Great.

434
00:24:21.266 --> 00:24:22.767
Good evening.

435
00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:26.600
I wanted to apologize for not
properly introducing myself.

436
00:24:26.734 --> 00:24:28.400
I'm Jade Taylor.

437
00:24:28.533 --> 00:24:30.100
Ah. yes. Our new guest.

438
00:24:30.834 --> 00:24:32.467
How's the crime fighting going?

439
00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.467
I'm Hibbert. This is Miss Maris.

440
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.367
Enjoying all that
rosé and frozen food?

441
00:24:42.266 --> 00:24:43.166
Cheers.
- Cheers.

442
00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:44.233
Cheers.

443
00:24:44.367 --> 00:24:45.767
Nice to meet you.

444
00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.567
Jade. there's someone
I want you to meet.

445
00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:49.967
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

446
00:24:52.066 --> 00:24:54.900
This is Ingrid. my fiance.

447
00:24:55.033 --> 00:24:56.100
Nice to meet you. Jade.

448
00:24:56.233 --> 00:24:57.400
You as well.

449
00:24:57.533 --> 00:24:58.900
Ingrid manages the
spa on the island.

450
00:24:59.033 --> 00:25:00.967
The best spa on the island.

451
00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.900
The only spa on the island.

452
00:25:04.533 --> 00:25:05.800
Here they come.

453
00:25:18.033 --> 00:25:20.200
Surprise!

454
00:25:24.133 --> 00:25:27.633
Ladies and gentlemen.
the happy couple.

455
00:25:27.767 --> 00:25:28.900
40 years.

456
00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:34.200
Let's have a few
words.

457
00:25:34.333 --> 00:25:36.533
Thank you.

458
00:25:36.667 --> 00:25:38.600
We had no idea.

459
00:25:40.967 --> 00:25:45.934
My son. the notary.
he makes us so proud.

460
00:25:47.033 --> 00:25:47.800
And look. he's done so again.

461
00:25:47.934 --> 00:25:50.133
So thank you all for
coming. Thank you.

462
00:25:50.266 --> 00:25:55.233
Well. one day. many years ago.

463
00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.000
whilst I was working at
my father's restaurant.

464
00:25:58.133 --> 00:26:03.166
the most beautiful woman
entered with her family

465
00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:08.667
and we have built a beautiful
life together.

466
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.066
Come. my love. say something.

467
00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.967
Giving this one a chance

468
00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.800
was the best thing
that I ever did.

469
00:26:20.166 --> 00:26:22.066
My son.

470
00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:22.934
And Ford.

471
00:26:23.066 --> 00:26:24.100
Thank you.

472
00:26:24.934 --> 00:26:29.467
Everyone. please.
enjoy yourself.

473
00:26:30.767 --> 00:26:31.567
Now...

474
00:26:32.867 --> 00:26:34.000
Let's lime.

475
00:26:39.166 --> 00:26:40.100
Come.

476
00:26:40.233 --> 00:26:41.767
Let's dance.

477
00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.934

I made breakfast
if you wanna join.

488
00:27:20.133 --> 00:27:21.166
Oh. morning.

489
00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:25.567
Only one condition.
your phone is not invited.

490
00:27:26.967 --> 00:27:29.367
Oh. I'm just finishing up...

491
00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:30.333
- Work stuff.
- Work stuff.

492
00:27:30.467 --> 00:27:31.233
Yeah.

493
00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:39.700
It smells nice.

494
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.700
So. Ford. tell me
something about yourself.

495
00:27:47.066 --> 00:27:48.967
Uh. there's not
really much to tell.

496
00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.300
Just out here living
my best island life.

497
00:27:51.433 --> 00:27:53.133
You're from the states. Where?

498
00:27:53.266 --> 00:27:54.934
What were you doing before this?

499
00:27:55.066 --> 00:27:56.467
Why all the questions?

500
00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.367
I'm just trying
to get to know you.

501
00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:02.367
You gotta give me
something. Come on.

502
00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:03.467
All right. fine.

503
00:28:06.033 --> 00:28:06.800
I'm from Jersey.

504
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000
Jersey?

505
00:28:09.133 --> 00:28:10.200
Interesting.

506
00:28:11.066 --> 00:28:12.400
Where's your accent?

507
00:28:12.533 --> 00:28:13.300
What accent?

508
00:28:14.467 --> 00:28:17.867
Yo. Vinny. where's
my pork roll?

509
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.533
First of all. it's Taylor Ham

510
00:28:19.667 --> 00:28:22.100
and I don't know anyone
who speaks like that. so...

511
00:28:23.133 --> 00:28:24.266
Okay.

512
00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.200
Where'd you go to college?

513
00:28:26.333 --> 00:28:27.900
Oh.

514
00:28:28.033 --> 00:28:29.100
More questions.

515
00:28:29.233 --> 00:28:30.867
Sorry.

516
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.900
It's in my nature.
I'm a news producer.

517
00:28:34.333 --> 00:28:35.433
Really?

518
00:28:35.567 --> 00:28:37.233
Now you seem surprised.

519
00:28:37.367 --> 00:28:38.633
No. No. I'm not.

520
00:28:41.166 --> 00:28:43.533
It actually makes perfect sense.

521
00:28:43.667 --> 00:28:44.834
Hello?

522
00:28:44.967 --> 00:28:45.767
Jane?

523
00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.066
We're up top. Ingrid.

524
00:28:49.667 --> 00:28:51.066
Good morning.

525
00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:51.867
Hey.

526
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.767
You ready?

527
00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:54.834
Ready for what?

528
00:28:54.967 --> 00:28:58.200
Ford told us what happened
with the rental scam.

529
00:28:58.333 --> 00:29:01.233
That is no way to start
a vacation. you see.

530
00:29:01.367 --> 00:29:04.600
so we are giving you a do-over.

531
00:29:04.734 --> 00:29:06.400
A spa day. on us.

532
00:29:06.533 --> 00:29:07.934
No.

533
00:29:08.066 --> 00:29:09.266
That's amazing.

534
00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:10.433
Really?

535
00:29:10.567 --> 00:29:12.133
Yes.

536
00:29:12.266 --> 00:29:12.967
Go.

537
00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:13.867
Go. have fun.

538
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:16.967
Oh my gosh.

539
00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:19.467
Thank you.

540
00:29:30.333 --> 00:29:32.200
Ingrid. this is stunning.

541
00:29:32.333 --> 00:29:33.367
Thank you.

542
00:29:40.266 --> 00:29:43.700
Vacation reboot starts now.

543
00:29:43.834 --> 00:29:45.367
I like the way you think.

544
00:30:15.233 --> 00:30:16.133
Oh.

545
00:30:16.266 --> 00:30:17.300
Sorry.

546
00:30:22.233 --> 00:30:24.300
So how long have you and
Hughes been together?

547
00:30:25.266 --> 00:30:29.633
We've known each other
since we were kids.

548
00:30:29.767 --> 00:30:31.367
but then he went off to
boarding school. you see.

549
00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:36.100
so we reconnected when
he came home for summers.

550
00:30:36.233 --> 00:30:39.867
Got engaged when he came
home from university.

551
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.734
He's a good one. Hughes.
- Yeah.

552
00:30:43.066 --> 00:30:45.200
His father mentioned
he's a notary?

553
00:30:45.333 --> 00:30:46.333
What is that here?

554
00:30:46.467 --> 00:30:47.667
Here?

555
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.300
It's prestigious.

556
00:30:50.467 --> 00:30:53.433
It's like being a lawyer.

557
00:30:53.567 --> 00:30:54.367
Wow.

558
00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.166
And his father is very proud.

559
00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:57.567
Yeah. I got that.

560
00:30:59.266 --> 00:31:03.367
Unfortunately it's. it's
not what Hughes wants.

561
00:31:04.967 --> 00:31:07.266
You saw him cooking
last night. right?

562
00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.066
Yes.

563
00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.367
It was delicious.

564
00:31:10.533 --> 00:31:13.367
I know. He's so talented.

565
00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:15.834
He wants to take over the
family beach restaurant.

566
00:31:15.967 --> 00:31:18.900
Just. after all that education.

567
00:31:19.033 --> 00:31:20.734
he can't disappoint his parents.

568
00:31:21.834 --> 00:31:22.600
Hm.

569
00:31:24.467 --> 00:31:25.600
I feel so lucky.

570
00:31:25.734 --> 00:31:29.066
I wake up every morning
excited to go to work.

571
00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.633
and love what I do.
so I feel for him.

572
00:31:34.533 --> 00:31:35.300
So do I.

573
00:31:37.467 --> 00:31:42.433
But things like that don't
matter to Pops Hughes.

574
00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:50.934
So. what do you think of Ford?

575
00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.700
Uh. I barely know him.

576
00:31:54.834 --> 00:31:55.667
Why?

577
00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.200
Why? Because he's a catch.

578
00:31:58.333 --> 00:32:01.934
The man is kind and easy
on the eyes and so forth.

579
00:32:02.066 --> 00:32:03.033
Have you not noticed?

580
00:32:04.633 --> 00:32:08.100
I didn't really come to
the island looking for love.

581
00:32:08.233 --> 00:32:10.233
I just went through a breakup

582
00:32:10.367 --> 00:32:11.800
and I was thrown
off when I met him.

583
00:32:11.934 --> 00:32:13.066
I thought I was getting robbed.

584
00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.333
I was holding a
lamp above my head.

585
00:32:15.467 --> 00:32:16.934
ready to take this swing at him.

586
00:32:17.066 --> 00:32:18.567
He's a tough one. though.

587
00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:21.800
But so great and so handsome.

588
00:32:21.934 --> 00:32:24.066
But so very private.

589
00:32:34.533 --> 00:32:35.667
What?

590
00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:36.633
Notice now?

591
00:32:48.133 --> 00:32:49.500
Come on. sit.

592
00:32:49.633 --> 00:32:50.433
Relax.

593
00:32:56.567 --> 00:32:58.900
I'm gonna go help mum with
today's produce delivery.

594
00:32:59.033 --> 00:32:59.800
Okay.

595
00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:33.867
Talk
about burying the lead.

596
00:33:48.033 --> 00:33:50.567
Anyone care for some fresh
ceviche and a cold beer?

597
00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:52.734
Uh. I'm okay. thanks.

598
00:33:52.867 --> 00:33:54.900
I've got some things
I need to get done.

599
00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:58.200
What about you. Ford?
You around later?

600
00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:01.533
Yeah.

601
00:34:01.667 --> 00:34:02.467
Yeah.

602
00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.266
Why?

603
00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.400
I have a surprise for you.

604
00:34:06.533 --> 00:34:09.266
It's a. a thank you surprise.

605
00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:14.467
Hm.

606
00:34:15.667 --> 00:34:16.567
A surprise.

607
00:34:19.333 --> 00:34:20.100
Don't.

608
00:34:38.834 --> 00:34:40.333
Good afternoon. Miss Maris.

609
00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:48.266
Hey.

610
00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:49.166
You hungry?

611
00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:50.900
I'm cooking.

612
00:34:52.266 --> 00:34:53.367
You cook?

613
00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.467
Yes. of course I
cook. That's insulting.

614
00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.467
I'm from Louisiana.

615
00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.700
I just never really
have time to slow down

616
00:34:59.834 --> 00:35:02.000
and do it right. that's all.

617
00:35:02.133 --> 00:35:04.500
Well. I mean. I thought
you were from New York.

618
00:35:04.633 --> 00:35:06.300
I mean. where's your accent?

619
00:35:06.433 --> 00:35:08.166
Oh. I lost it.

620
00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:10.200
I moved to New York right
after I graduated college.

621
00:35:10.333 --> 00:35:11.633
I couldn't wait to get there.

622
00:35:11.767 --> 00:35:14.367
You literally have
no accent. Can't tell.

623
00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:15.800
I took diction classes.

624
00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.867
All I cared about was
being Christiane Amanpour.

625
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.500
I never made it on air myself.

626
00:35:21.633 --> 00:35:24.200
but I got there as
fast as I could.

627
00:35:24.333 --> 00:35:27.934
threw myself into it and
I'm like a native now.

628
00:35:28.066 --> 00:35:28.834
Hm.

629
00:35:31.834 --> 00:35:33.433
What are you cooking?

630
00:35:33.567 --> 00:35:34.800
Jambalaya.

631
00:35:34.934 --> 00:35:35.700
You wanna help?

632
00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:40.333
♪ Oh yeah ♪

633
00:35:40.467 --> 00:35:44.333

638
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.934
Good. Could use a little more.

639
00:36:04.066 --> 00:36:05.200
- Oh?
- Mm-hm.

640
00:36:07.066 --> 00:36:07.734
Keep it coming. Come on.

641
00:36:07.867 --> 00:36:08.934
Oh. okay.

642
00:36:09.066 --> 00:36:10.600
I ain't scared
of a little spice.

643
00:36:14.233 --> 00:36:15.033
All right.

644
00:36:16.333 --> 00:36:18.100
Let's see if you
can take the heat...

645
00:36:20.233 --> 00:36:21.867
Or get out of the kitchen.

646
00:36:23.734 --> 00:36:25.066
Is that too much for you?

647
00:36:27.367 --> 00:36:28.533
Bay-bay.

648
00:36:28.667 --> 00:36:29.333
Yeah?

649
00:36:29.467 --> 00:36:30.100
Now that's good.

650
00:36:30.233 --> 00:36:31.200
- Okay.
- Mm-hm.

651
00:36:31.333 --> 00:36:32.533
We're spicy simpatico. then.

652
00:36:32.667 --> 00:36:35.500
Mm-hm. I believe I'm
a little Louisiana now.

653
00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:39.800
My ex thought Tabasco
sauce was strong.

654
00:36:42.834 --> 00:36:44.600
Yes. my ex was a punk.

655
00:36:50.667 --> 00:36:55.333
So. tell me about this
spice deficient ex of yours.

656
00:36:55.467 --> 00:36:58.166
Oh. I don't wanna bore
you with my love life

657
00:36:58.300 --> 00:36:59.500
or lack thereof.

658
00:36:59.633 --> 00:37:01.166
Oh. okay. so you get
to ask the questions.

659
00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:02.600
but you don't have
to answer 'em?

660
00:37:02.734 --> 00:37:03.500
Fair enough.

661
00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.800
He claimed that I put work
before our relationship.

662
00:37:08.934 --> 00:37:09.834
which is not true.

663
00:37:12.633 --> 00:37:13.700
It's a little bit true.

664
00:37:14.967 --> 00:37:19.700
but he wasn't the one and my
life is very fast paced and...

665
00:37:21.533 --> 00:37:22.467
You wouldn't understand.

666
00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:25.500
I mean. your island in
life is the exact opposite

667
00:37:25.633 --> 00:37:27.300
of my New York life.

668
00:37:27.433 --> 00:37:29.767
Actually. I do.

669
00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:31.266
I do understand.

670
00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:35.166
You actually remind me of
someone I used to know.

671
00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:47.867
Gotta post a few
vacation photos.

672
00:37:51.867 --> 00:37:53.633
Are you on social media?

673
00:37:53.767 --> 00:37:54.533
No.

674
00:37:55.867 --> 00:37:56.633
Facebook? Twitter?

675
00:37:56.767 --> 00:37:58.066
Nothing?

676
00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:59.100
Nope. nope. nope.

677
00:38:00.867 --> 00:38:02.567
Hm.

678
00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:04.000
Just like my privacy. mm.

679
00:38:04.133 --> 00:38:04.900
I get that.

680
00:38:06.867 --> 00:38:09.400
One question. and
one question only.

681
00:38:09.533 --> 00:38:10.734
Go ahead. ask.

682
00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.367
Have you ever been in love?

683
00:38:21.834 --> 00:38:24.066
Yeah. I had a fiance once.

684
00:38:25.133 --> 00:38:25.900
Three years ago.

685
00:38:27.533 --> 00:38:29.200
What happened?

686
00:38:29.333 --> 00:38:30.667
I said one question.

687
00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.200
It's a follow up question.

688
00:38:35.767 --> 00:38:37.967
Listen. um there's
a big celebration

689
00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:39.667
tomorrow at the yacht club.

690
00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:42.333
Would you like to. you
know. maybe be my...

691
00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.000
Your?

692
00:38:46.133 --> 00:38:48.233
My plus one?

693
00:38:49.867 --> 00:38:51.033
Mm?

694
00:38:51.166 --> 00:38:52.767
It's gonna be a
special celebration.

695
00:38:54.467 --> 00:38:57.367
Team Hughes won the
Annual Sailing Race

696
00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:58.934
last year. three peat. so.

697
00:38:59.834 --> 00:39:01.700
You're a sailor?

698
00:39:01.834 --> 00:39:04.000
Ah. just part of a team.

699
00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:07.033
The winner of the final
gets to keep the Cup

700
00:39:07.166 --> 00:39:08.633
until the start of
the new racing season.

701
00:39:08.767 --> 00:39:11.133
so this is like our farewell
celebration for that.

702
00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:14.066
It's kind of a big deal.

703
00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:14.934
Big deal?

704
00:39:15.066 --> 00:39:15.934
Oh. yeah.

705
00:39:17.533 --> 00:39:18.967
Love to be your plus one.

706
00:39:23.233 --> 00:39:24.000
Cool.

707
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000
Hey. sailor?

708
00:39:39.367 --> 00:39:40.133
Yes?

709
00:39:41.333 --> 00:39:42.800
What's the attire
for this thing?

710
00:39:44.834 --> 00:39:46.734
Island formal.

711
00:39:46.867 --> 00:39:47.967
Got it.

712
00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:49.400
Island formal.

713
00:39:50.567 --> 00:39:52.000
I'll meet you at the cart in 30.

714
00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:21.467
Wow.

715
00:40:24.133 --> 00:40:25.100
Okay. what?

716
00:40:25.967 --> 00:40:27.467
Nothing.

717
00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:30.834
Nothing. you just clean up
really nice. that's all.

718
00:40:32.066 --> 00:40:33.133
For a second there. I...

719
00:40:34.967 --> 00:40:36.100
I can't place it.

720
00:40:36.233 --> 00:40:38.100
I thought you looked
familiar. but...

721
00:40:38.233 --> 00:40:41.033
Well. you probably
recognize me from.

722
00:40:42.266 --> 00:40:46.000
you know. my days as
a former GQ model.

723
00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:49.934
Right.

724
00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:54.633
Okay. okay. it
wasn't that funny.

725
00:41:11.133 --> 00:41:12.300
Ford!

726
00:41:13.333 --> 00:41:14.100
Jade.

727
00:41:16.266 --> 00:41:17.333
Have fun.

728
00:41:17.467 --> 00:41:19.033
I'll catch up with you later.

729
00:41:22.133 --> 00:41:22.900
Hey.

730
00:41:24.867 --> 00:41:27.500
Remember earlier
when I said wow?

731
00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:31.066
I meant it.

732
00:41:36.533 --> 00:41:37.433
Oh!

733
00:41:41.266 --> 00:41:42.133
Hey!

734
00:41:42.266 --> 00:41:43.467
- You all right?
- Man.

735
00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:44.300
Hey.

736
00:41:44.433 --> 00:41:45.200
Hey. come on. man. hey.

737
00:41:45.333 --> 00:41:46.500
Hey.

738
00:41:46.633 --> 00:41:47.800
How are you?

739
00:41:47.934 --> 00:41:48.867
Don't.

740
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.166
I wasn't going to say
anything. Not a thing.

741
00:41:55.467 --> 00:41:56.200
What's up?

742
00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.734
Who's that?

743
00:41:59.867 --> 00:42:02.166
Two execs from a
chain restaurant.

744
00:42:03.033 --> 00:42:05.266
And Pop's putting on
a dog and pony show.

745
00:42:06.667 --> 00:42:08.033
They don't belong here.

746
00:42:08.166 --> 00:42:10.133
They're not part of
this celebration.

747
00:42:12.333 --> 00:42:13.300
You know. once
he makes this deal.

748
00:42:13.433 --> 00:42:15.000
there's no going back. right?

749
00:42:16.066 --> 00:42:16.800
Yeah.

750
00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:21.000
And he's gonna make a whole
lot of money off this deal.

751
00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:26.934
He can retire rich and
proud his son's a notary.

752
00:42:31.867 --> 00:42:32.967
- Oh.

753
00:42:35.166 --> 00:42:36.934
I'll just be a
second. Excuse me.

754
00:42:41.767 --> 00:42:42.600
Hello?

755
00:42:42.734 --> 00:42:44.433
Hey. you're on speaker.

756
00:42:44.567 --> 00:42:45.967
I'm with Gabby.

757
00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:48.767
Hi Jade. We just wanted
to check in with you.

758
00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:50.033
You know. I've done
a lot of digging

759
00:42:50.166 --> 00:42:52.400
and your vacation
rental scam thing

760
00:42:52.533 --> 00:42:54.367
could actually be
a bigger story.

761
00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:55.467
Oh.

762
00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:56.734
Okay. cool.

763
00:42:56.867 --> 00:42:58.600
That could just be
the story that I need.

764
00:42:58.734 --> 00:43:02.367
But no rush. We can flush
it out when I get back.

765
00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:04.033
Well look at you.

766
00:43:05.166 --> 00:43:07.400
Yes. and check this out.

767
00:43:12.734 --> 00:43:14.867
How's that for having
fun in the sun. hm?

768
00:43:18.066 --> 00:43:20.100
Oh. and can you
check him out for me?

769
00:43:20.233 --> 00:43:23.000
He seems a little
familiar or something.

770
00:43:23.133 --> 00:43:25.133
I just can't place it.

771
00:43:25.266 --> 00:43:27.200
I knew you couldn't
help yourself.

772
00:43:28.834 --> 00:43:30.333
Okay you two. I'll
talk to you later.

773
00:43:30.467 --> 00:43:32.834
I'm officially turning off
my phone for the night.

774
00:43:32.967 --> 00:43:33.734
Bye.

775
00:43:37.066 --> 00:43:37.934
I'm sorry.

776
00:43:38.066 --> 00:43:39.667
Did that just happen?
- Yes.

777
00:43:41.767 --> 00:43:43.000
What's up?

778
00:43:43.133 --> 00:43:45.133
Oh. nothing. We were
on the phone with Jade.

779
00:43:45.266 --> 00:43:46.300
How lovely.

780
00:43:46.433 --> 00:43:48.967
Let me remind you. she's on
vacation. you two aren't.

781
00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:51.767

00:45:04.133 --> 00:45:04.934
You okay?

802
00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:08.767

00:45:10.533 --> 00:45:11.300

00:45:12.567 --> 00:45:13.333

805
00:45:14.266 --> 00:45:16.400
We get married soon. Hughes.

806
00:45:16.533 --> 00:45:17.834
Yes. we do.

807
00:45:19.066 --> 00:45:21.133
So it needs to be before that.

808
00:45:21.266 --> 00:45:22.033
Why?

809
00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:24.800
I love you. Hughes.

810
00:45:24.934 --> 00:45:27.767
which means I want a
happy and proud husband.

811
00:45:28.967 --> 00:45:31.066
Being a notary makes
your father happy.

812
00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:33.967
but does it truly
make you happy?

813
00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:37.066
I'm proud of you no
matter what you do.

814
00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.500
as long as you do the
right thing for your heart.

815
00:45:44.767 --> 00:45:47.667
Hey. hey. you guys.

816
00:45:49.033 --> 00:45:49.967
Hello?

817
00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:51.266
Come on you two.

818
00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:54.000
Come on. let's dance.
What are you doing?

819
00:45:54.133 --> 00:45:55.266
Aye.

820
00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:59.934
Oh. please. please
don't.

821
00:46:01.834 --> 00:46:04.100
She's right. He
does look familiar.

822
00:46:07.633 --> 00:46:08.367
Wait a minute.

823
00:46:13.433 --> 00:46:14.567
Gabby.

824
00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:16.033
Can you bring me the file?

825
00:46:16.166 --> 00:46:18.266
You know the one on the
New Jersey DA scandal?

826
00:46:19.433 --> 00:46:20.700
Thanks.

827
00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:30.200
Hey. what's up?

828
00:46:31.333 --> 00:46:32.100
Right there.

829
00:46:33.967 --> 00:46:35.433
Lose the beard and it's him.

830
00:46:37.367 --> 00:46:39.233
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

831
00:46:39.367 --> 00:46:40.700
Malcolm Elliot Jr.?

832
00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:58.133
dr)

833
00:47:05.934 --> 00:47:09.500
"I am officially
inviting you on a date.

834
00:47:09.633 --> 00:47:11.166
Please spend the day with me.

835
00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:14.467
P.S.. your phone is not invited.

836
00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:15.367
Ford."

837
00:47:16.867 --> 00:47:17.633
Of course.

838
00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:25.333
All right.

839
00:47:25.467 --> 00:47:26.834
Please tell me something
has changed from last night.

840
00:47:26.967 --> 00:47:28.266
I didn't sleep at all.

841
00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:30.467
I spent it researching
Malcolm Elliot Jr.

842
00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:33.166
Right after the case blew
up. he just disappeared.

843
00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:34.934
There was no sign
of him anywhere.

844
00:47:35.967 --> 00:47:36.767
Look at this.

845
00:47:41.467 --> 00:47:42.533
Has to be the same guy.

846
00:47:47.533 --> 00:47:50.633
Well. here's a call
I don't want to make.

847
00:48:10.467 --> 00:48:12.600
Jerk chicken. spicy.

848
00:48:13.433 --> 00:48:15.967
Oh. make that
two. Extra spicy.

849
00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:16.867
Mm.

850
00:48:17.867 --> 00:48:18.500
Okay. I'll
bring it right now.

851
00:48:18.633 --> 00:48:19.433
Thank you.

852
00:48:20.667 --> 00:48:22.166
First concert?

853
00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:24.700
Nas with my older
brother. Yours?

854
00:48:24.834 --> 00:48:26.567
BSB with my younger sister.

855
00:48:27.266 --> 00:48:28.800
Really owe her a phone call.

856
00:48:28.934 --> 00:48:30.967
Wait. I'm sorry. What's BSB?

857
00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:33.000
Backstreet Boys.

858
00:48:33.133 --> 00:48:34.500
You gotta be kidding me.

859
00:48:34.633 --> 00:48:36.133
What?

860
00:48:36.266 --> 00:48:39.500
Well. I just. no. I never
thought you'd be so corny.

861
00:48:39.633 --> 00:48:41.533
Okay. I am not corny.

862
00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:46.400
Were there any other Black
people where you grew up?

863
00:48:46.533 --> 00:48:50.166
BSB has a very diverse
audience. thank you very much.

864
00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:52.700
And "I Want It That Way"
is a brilliant pop song.

865
00:48:52.834 --> 00:48:54.567
Pop songs are underrated.

866
00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:55.867
People will be listening to them

867
00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.533
for years to come.
like Beethoven.

868
00:49:04.166 --> 00:49:05.166
Are you kidding me?

869
00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:09.433
Wow. I. yeah. I was with you
until Beethoven.

870
00:49:09.567 --> 00:49:12.834
So what was your life
like before you moved here?

871
00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:15.166
It was. um...

872
00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:18.233
It was busy.

873
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.667
Too busy to realize
what really mattered.

874
00:49:24.767 --> 00:49:28.367
That's why I'm always on you
about the phone. you know?

875
00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:32.033
It creates a barrier.
a distraction.

876
00:49:32.166 --> 00:49:33.633
Makes it hard to be present.

877
00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:35.400
Yeah.

878
00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:38.900
Yeah. I get it.

879
00:49:39.033 --> 00:49:42.333
It's just. it's how
things are done.

880
00:49:43.467 --> 00:49:46.433
That's how life is right
now. You can't turn it off.

881
00:49:46.567 --> 00:49:47.967
You slow down. you're done.

882
00:49:48.767 --> 00:49:50.333
No. I don't think so.

883
00:49:52.066 --> 00:49:53.367
I think we have a choice.

884
00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:55.467
Is that why you moved here?

885
00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:56.467
Was that a choice?

886
00:50:00.533 --> 00:50:02.734
It's one of the reasons. yeah.

887
00:50:02.867 --> 00:50:06.066
I can just be. here.

888
00:50:08.166 --> 00:50:08.934
I get it.

889
00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:14.066
I understand. 'cause
I'm always just going.

890
00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:17.767
going. going. and maybe I do...

891
00:50:20.734 --> 00:50:21.500
Nevermind.

892
00:50:24.233 --> 00:50:26.300
So is this it for you?

893
00:50:26.433 --> 00:50:30.133
Just beaches. sunsets.

894
00:50:31.367 --> 00:50:32.633
Island life forever.

895
00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:36.233
First of all. that's
a terrible accent.

896
00:50:37.433 --> 00:50:39.200
But no. not exactly.

897
00:50:39.333 --> 00:50:40.600
I have a business here.

898
00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:44.800
And here we go.

899
00:50:44.934 --> 00:50:45.567
Ooh-wee.

900
00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:47.967
Hope you keep your water full.

901
00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:49.367
Thank you.

902
00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:51.600
Ladies and gentlemen.
the jerk has arrived.

903
00:50:51.734 --> 00:50:52.467
Right.

904
00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:54.967
Who needs water?

905
00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:55.934
We got this.

906
00:50:57.533 --> 00:50:58.433
It's delicious.

907
00:50:58.567 --> 00:51:00.200
Not spicy enough.
- Ooh.

908
00:51:08.233 --> 00:51:10.467
Is that the goat from
outside of your house?

909
00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:11.333
Mm-hm. sure is.

910
00:51:11.467 --> 00:51:13.967
She wanders around
town now and then.

911
00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:18.533
Miss Edith adopted her. but
she hangs out with all of us.

912
00:51:18.667 --> 00:51:20.000
This is Shirley.

913
00:51:20.133 --> 00:51:23.333
Three time Miss Maceo
Island pageant winner.

914
00:51:23.467 --> 00:51:25.166
Wait. wait. what am I hearing?

915
00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:27.967
There's actually a
goat beauty pageant?

916
00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:32.934
Yep. every year. It
is an island tradition.

917
00:51:33.066 --> 00:51:35.166
Hence the photo and the sash.

918
00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:36.433
This is good.

919
00:51:36.567 --> 00:51:37.934
Yeah. it's this very.
very serious event.

920
00:51:38.066 --> 00:51:38.867
Oh.

921
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.166
- Mm-hm.
- Sorry.

922
00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:42.600
Just not a fan of
beauty pageants.

923
00:51:42.734 --> 00:51:45.600
My sister Janelle was
a beauty pageant queen.

924
00:51:45.734 --> 00:51:47.467
We're very different.

925
00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:49.633
Well you know. that's
the thing about family.

926
00:51:49.767 --> 00:51:53.100
You know. sometimes they
can work your last nerve.

927
00:51:53.233 --> 00:51:55.834
but so what. you know?

928
00:51:55.967 --> 00:51:57.166
And like you said.
you're different.

929
00:51:57.300 --> 00:51:58.834
You can't leave 'em in the past.

930
00:52:00.133 --> 00:52:01.500
After all. they're the ones
who will always have your back.

931
00:52:01.633 --> 00:52:03.567
That's right.

932
00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:05.667
Even if she tells me
that my job doesn't matter

933
00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:08.266
because I'm behind the camera.

934
00:52:11.133 --> 00:52:11.767
- Hey man.
- Hey.

935
00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:13.700
Afternoon. Jade.

936
00:52:13.834 --> 00:52:14.767
Hello. Hughes.

937
00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:16.033
What you doing
out the office. man?

938
00:52:16.166 --> 00:52:17.333
Oh. heading back
to the restaurant

939
00:52:17.467 --> 00:52:18.233
to help my mom with
some bookkeeping.

940
00:52:18.367 --> 00:52:19.900
Oh. you're such a good son.

941
00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:26.333
Well. even though someone told
me to leave my phone behind.

942
00:52:26.467 --> 00:52:27.600
don't think I'm
not getting a photo

943
00:52:27.734 --> 00:52:29.233
with the pageant
queen over here.

944
00:52:29.367 --> 00:52:30.900
- Yes you are.
- Would you mind?

945
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.033
Come on. Ford.

946
00:52:33.166 --> 00:52:34.166
Get it on this.

947
00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:35.066
Me?

948
00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:36.333
No.
- Get lower. get lower.

949
00:52:36.467 --> 00:52:37.667
Get lower. Got
you. get in there.

950
00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:39.100
Come on. get in there.

951
00:52:39.233 --> 00:52:40.600
Get in there.

952
00:52:42.066 --> 00:52:43.667
It's only
for Shirley. okay?

953
00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:44.967
For Shirley.

954
00:52:49.066 --> 00:52:50.433
Hey Shirley.

955
00:52:50.567 --> 00:52:53.333
Oh my God. okay. God.
please. don't bite the watch.

956
00:52:53.467 --> 00:52:56.100
Don't much on the
watch. Bad. bad goat.

957
00:52:56.233 --> 00:52:57.367
My God. my dad gave me this

958
00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:58.834
as a graduation gift
from law school.

959
00:52:58.967 --> 00:53:01.500
Come on.

960
00:53:01.633 --> 00:53:02.834
Have a great time. kids.

961
00:53:02.967 --> 00:53:04.500
Yep.

962
00:53:04.633 --> 00:53:07.000
You. um. you
went to law school?

963
00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:10.900
Yeah. yeah I've
done a lot of things.

964
00:53:11.033 --> 00:53:15.000
but I'm here now and
I like it. so yeah.

965
00:53:17.867 --> 00:53:20.567
Come on. let's take a little
walk on the beach. huh?

966
00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:21.700
Hm?

967
00:53:25.767 --> 00:53:26.667
What a perfect day.

968
00:53:29.066 --> 00:53:30.166
I used to take walks like this

969
00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:33.667
on my grandpa's crawfish
farm.

970
00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:35.600
You know if there's
anything I regret.

971
00:53:35.734 --> 00:53:38.633
it's not going home more often.

972
00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:43.734
I have to admit. I enjoyed
not having my phone today.

973
00:53:43.867 --> 00:53:44.867
Thank you.

974
00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:50.300
It was liberating and I feel
like I got to know you more.

975
00:53:52.467 --> 00:53:56.000
So tell me. your
perfect island life.

976
00:53:56.133 --> 00:53:59.700
do you ever see
anything more or?

977
00:54:01.867 --> 00:54:04.700
Well. the thing is.
if you had asked me that

978
00:54:04.834 --> 00:54:05.567
when I first got here.

979
00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:07.767
the answer would've
been a hard no.

980
00:54:09.633 --> 00:54:10.400
But now...

981
00:54:19.533 --> 00:54:20.333
Hey Ford.

982
00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:23.900
Another tourist drove a
golf cart into the pond.

983
00:54:24.033 --> 00:54:26.166
You gotta come and fish it out.

984
00:54:27.633 --> 00:54:29.600
Yeah. yeah. Okay.
I'll be right there.

985
00:54:34.133 --> 00:54:34.934
Duty calls.

986
00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:38.667
Be back in a few hours.

987
00:55:04.533 --> 00:55:05.800
Hey.

988
00:55:05.934 --> 00:55:06.967
What is going on?

989
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.800
the one at the New
Jersey DA's office?

990
00:55:13.934 --> 00:55:15.400
The one that you referred to

991
00:55:15.533 --> 00:55:17.300
in the interview with
the Congresswoman?

992
00:55:17.433 --> 00:55:19.166
I remember the
broad strokes. Why?

993
00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:21.333
Well you were right.

994
00:55:21.467 --> 00:55:23.000
He is familiar.

995
00:55:23.133 --> 00:55:25.033
I'm about to send you a photo.

996
00:55:26.367 --> 00:55:27.467
Seriously?

997
00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:28.867
This is happening?

998
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.834
Tabitha put me on
a leave of absence.

999
00:55:30.967 --> 00:55:32.734
Oh. I wouldn't do this
if I didn't have to.

1000
00:55:32.867 --> 00:55:36.834
but you. my dear. are in
the middle of a story.

1001
00:55:37.867 --> 00:55:38.700
Come again?

1002
00:55:38.834 --> 00:55:39.834
I'm not kidding.

1003
00:55:39.967 --> 00:55:41.400
Ha ha.

1004
00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:48.033
What? What is this
I'm looking at?

1005
00:55:48.166 --> 00:55:50.834
The guy standing behind
former DA George Clayton?

1006
00:55:50.967 --> 00:55:53.033
In the middle. with the beard?

1007
00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:59.100
ADA Malcolm Elliot. Jr.

1008
00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:01.867
This is a huge story.

1009
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.066
He tried the case and
it was a slam dunk

1010
00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:05.967
that ended in a mistrial.

1011
00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:08.734
It never got retried
and he's the only one

1012
00:56:08.867 --> 00:56:10.934
whose side of the scandal
has never been heard.

1013
00:56:11.066 --> 00:56:12.867
He literally disappeared.

1014
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.367
All right. well. my
guy's name is Ford.

1015
00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:17.133
People have doppelgangers.

1016
00:56:21.066 --> 00:56:22.233
It just really looks like him.

1017
00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:27.867
He took the fall
for the mistrial.

1018
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.433
Some people say he was bribed.

1019
00:56:30.567 --> 00:56:33.367
No wonder he's hiding
out on a tiny island.

1020
00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:35.633
Okay. we don't know
that this is Ford.

1021
00:56:36.867 --> 00:56:39.734
But we need verification. stat.

1022
00:56:39.867 --> 00:56:40.800
Well. it gets worse.

1023
00:56:40.934 --> 00:56:43.467
Rumor has it Clayton.
Malcolm Elliot's old boss.

1024
00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:45.967
is about to announce he's
running for governor.

1025
00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:49.467
Great.

1026
00:56:52.033 --> 00:56:53.900
Thanks for tasting
this with me.

1027
00:56:54.967 --> 00:56:58.133
I'm gonna pitch it my folks
as a new appetizer menu item.

1028
00:56:59.000 --> 00:56:59.967
I need a second opinion.

1029
00:57:01.166 --> 00:57:02.133
Of course my friend.

1030
00:57:02.266 --> 00:57:05.300
I will take free. delicious
snacks anytime. any day.

1031
00:57:05.433 --> 00:57:08.333
So. you and Jade. Talk to me.

1032
00:57:11.633 --> 00:57:13.633
I was watching you
both last night. and?

1033
00:57:16.633 --> 00:57:18.633
And now you just spent
the day together.

1034
00:57:20.133 --> 00:57:22.734
Ford. and she's a news
producer from New York.

1035
00:57:24.133 --> 00:57:25.333
Look. I know. man.

1036
00:57:25.467 --> 00:57:26.233
I just...

1037
00:57:28.967 --> 00:57:30.133
I like her.

1038
00:57:30.266 --> 00:57:31.033
I can't help it.

1039
00:57:37.333 --> 00:57:40.700
It's a bit risky. in
my opinion. for a fling.

1040
00:57:40.834 --> 00:57:44.000
You know. I really
wish it was just a fling.

1041
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:49.000
You know. a fling. it's
light. it's breezy.

1042
00:57:49.133 --> 00:57:51.300
She is far too
complicated for a fling.

1043
00:57:51.433 --> 00:57:52.967
Well. if you wanna
start something new.

1044
00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:55.066
you're gonna have to
tell her the truth.

1045
00:57:56.266 --> 00:57:57.800
I'm working on it. okay?

1046
00:58:05.233 --> 00:58:06.266
Okay.

1047
00:58:07.133 --> 00:58:10.200
Okay. okay. okay.
man. that is good.

1048
00:58:10.333 --> 00:58:13.100
Your dad is gonna love this.

1049
00:58:31.834 --> 00:58:32.600
M. Ford?

1050
00:58:54.333 --> 00:58:55.467
What am I doing?

1051
00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:02.934
Malcolm Elliot Jr.
And Brooke Davis.

1052
00:59:03.934 --> 00:59:08.266
Son of Malcolm Elliot.
Sr. and Allison Ford.

1053
00:59:35.867 --> 00:59:37.266
"Great day. went to bed.

1054
00:59:38.633 --> 00:59:40.166
See you tomorrow."

1055
01:00:23.033 --> 01:00:24.266
Hey. ready to go?

1056
01:00:25.367 --> 01:00:28.367
Uh. I'm sorry. Wait. go where?

1057
01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:30.600
Waterside picnic.

1058
01:00:30.734 --> 01:00:33.233
Uh. private island.

1059
01:00:33.367 --> 01:00:35.000
I got some hookups.

1060
01:00:35.133 --> 01:00:37.233
Thought you might
enjoy the scenery and.

1061
01:00:37.367 --> 01:00:38.200
you know. a boat ride.

1062
01:00:40.934 --> 01:00:42.533
Yeah. Yeah. that sounds great.

1063
01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:45.800
I'll just be a minute.

1064
01:00:45.934 --> 01:00:48.200
What's up? You're usually
a bit more talkative.

1065
01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:00.367
Just thinking.

1066
01:01:01.367 --> 01:01:02.100
About what?

1067
01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:05.166
Now who's the one
doing the interviewing?

1068
01:01:08.333 --> 01:01:11.600
Just thinking about the
fact that I'm leaving soon.

1069
01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:14.533
Not sure that I want to.

1070
01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:17.667
Are you serious?

1071
01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:19.200
You're not itching
to get back to work?

1072
01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:21.500
Honestly. no.

1073
01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:26.333
But you can't hide from
real life forever. right?

1074
01:01:29.667 --> 01:01:30.900
I'll see you downstairs in 10?

1075
01:01:54.033 --> 01:01:55.166
This has got to be

1076
01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:58.400
the most beautiful
place I've ever seen.

1077
01:01:58.533 --> 01:02:00.367
Oh. it's gonna get better.

1078
01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:01.367
Just come.

1079
01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:02.133
Better?

1080
01:02:02.266 --> 01:02:03.033
Mm-hm.

1081
01:02:03.166 --> 01:02:04.233
Yeah. just follow me.

1082
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.266
Wow. you were not lying

1083
01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.200
when you said you
had the hookup.

1084
01:02:20.333 --> 01:02:21.400
And rosé.

1085
01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:23.400
It's your favorite.

1086
01:02:23.533 --> 01:02:24.767
My favorite.

1087
01:02:30.767 --> 01:02:31.567
Ford...

1088
01:02:33.333 --> 01:02:37.333
There's a lot of reasons I
don't wanna go back to New York.

1089
01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:39.667
I need to tell you something.

1090
01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:41.667
I know.

1091
01:02:44.233 --> 01:02:45.567
I have feelings for you. too.

1092
01:02:49.066 --> 01:02:53.300
Look. there's something
I have to tell you. too.

1093
01:02:53.433 --> 01:02:55.300
But I need to know
that I can trust you.

1094
01:02:55.433 --> 01:02:56.133
Seriously?

1095
01:02:56.266 --> 01:02:57.934
Come on. you're
a news producer

1096
01:02:58.066 --> 01:03:00.400
who told me that she puts
her job before relationships.

1097
01:03:01.834 --> 01:03:02.867
Oh. that.

1098
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:03.867
Mm-hm.

1099
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.467
Fair enough.

1100
01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:07.467
Look. um...

1101
01:03:10.433 --> 01:03:11.667
I was a version of you.

1102
01:03:13.767 --> 01:03:16.834
Very passionate about my
job. worked long hours.

1103
01:03:19.633 --> 01:03:20.867
but I. um...

1104
01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:28.166
I trusted my mentor and
everything came crashing down.

1105
01:03:30.633 --> 01:03:31.400
Ford.

1106
01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:33.867
I know.

1107
01:03:36.166 --> 01:03:36.967
It's okay.

1108
01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:42.500
Wait. what do
you mean you know?

1109
01:03:42.633 --> 01:03:45.033
It's nice to meet
you. Malcolm Elliot. Jr.

1110
01:03:49.567 --> 01:03:50.567
You knew?

1111
01:03:52.967 --> 01:03:55.867
What. you come down here
looking for me? Like?

1112
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
What? No.

1113
01:03:58.133 --> 01:04:01.500
No. no. I sent some vacation
photos to my coworkers.

1114
01:04:01.633 --> 01:04:03.400
One of 'em recognized you-

1115
01:04:03.533 --> 01:04:05.900
Your coworkers who
are news producers?

1116
01:04:06.033 --> 01:04:07.367
Right.
- Ford. hey.

1117
01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:08.367
Hey. it's me.

1118
01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:13.433
Look. so what. you didn't
have them check up on me?

1119
01:04:13.567 --> 01:04:14.667
Hm?

1120
01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.934
You mean to tell me you weren't
snooping around about me?

1121
01:04:24.233 --> 01:04:27.600
Wow. this is exactly
what I was afraid of.

1122
01:04:29.133 --> 01:04:32.133
Wait. so you're not
gonna talk anymore? What?

1123
01:04:34.533 --> 01:04:36.734
I actually thought
that I could trust you.

1124
01:04:38.333 --> 01:04:39.533
I need to get back to the shop.

1125
01:04:39.667 --> 01:04:41.400
This. this was a mistake.

1126
01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:30.734
You were so secretive.

1127
01:05:33.166 --> 01:05:35.600
And I. I thought for a minute

1128
01:05:35.734 --> 01:05:37.633
that I recognized you. but I...

1129
01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:44.500
George Clayton. district
attorney of New Jersey.

1130
01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:49.667
my mentor. my friend.
he took a bribe.

1131
01:05:52.567 --> 01:05:54.500
He leaked information
that led to a mistrial

1132
01:05:54.633 --> 01:05:55.900
in a money laundering case.

1133
01:05:57.166 --> 01:05:58.600
I had no idea it was
him until he told me

1134
01:05:58.734 --> 01:06:00.834
I couldn't retry the case.

1135
01:06:00.967 --> 01:06:02.433
Pieced a few things together

1136
01:06:04.867 --> 01:06:06.100
and the bad guys walked.

1137
01:06:08.066 --> 01:06:10.467
The whole thing looked
shady and it was my case.

1138
01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:16.567
I lost faith in institutions
and people that I believed in.

1139
01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:18.767
including my fiance who walked

1140
01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:20.433
the second things got ugly.

1141
01:06:20.567 --> 01:06:22.734
I mean. she barely even wanted
to hear my side of the story.

1142
01:06:22.867 --> 01:06:25.800
much less stick around and
bear with me through it.

1143
01:06:31.834 --> 01:06:33.033
You can't just pretend

1144
01:06:33.166 --> 01:06:34.867
that a part of your
life never happened.

1145
01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:39.867
Why not finally tell your story?

1146
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:40.900
I can help you.

1147
01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:44.867
You're asking me for an
interview just like that?

1148
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.433
Just off the bat?

1149
01:06:46.567 --> 01:06:48.800
What if my life gets blown
up for a second time?

1150
01:06:50.133 --> 01:06:50.834
No. I...

1151
01:06:50.967 --> 01:06:52.734
No.

1152
01:06:52.867 --> 01:06:54.867
I'm not saying that
you have to do it.

1153
01:06:57.567 --> 01:06:59.500
I'm just saying that.
I think you should.

1154
01:06:59.633 --> 01:07:01.934
I mean. at least
just think about it.

1155
01:07:03.533 --> 01:07:05.767
because what are you. what
are you really doing here?

1156
01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:08.033
Are you living or are
you just hiding out?

1157
01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.967
Ford. not all stories and
the way you imagine it.

1158
01:07:14.233 --> 01:07:14.967
I...

1159
01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:19.900
I can't do this right now. okay?

1160
01:07:20.033 --> 01:07:22.333
I'm gonna spend the
night at Hughes's house.

1161
01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:45.000
What's
going on with Ford?

1162
01:07:45.133 --> 01:07:47.133
I know he stayed with
Hughes last night.

1163
01:07:48.734 --> 01:07:52.800
I found out by
accident about his past.

1164
01:07:56.867 --> 01:07:59.033
I had to tell him
that I knew and then

1165
01:08:01.367 --> 01:08:06.367
when we talked. I think I
just. I pushed him too far.

1166
01:08:08.934 --> 01:08:13.900
I should have just left
it or listened.

1167
01:08:15.166 --> 01:08:15.967
Are you telling
me this as someone

1168
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:18.266
who wants to be with Ford?

1169
01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:21.734
Or are you telling me
this as a news producer

1170
01:08:21.867 --> 01:08:23.066
who wants her story?

1171
01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:29.233
Both. I guess.

1172
01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:35.900
When I met Ford. I had no
idea who he was. and then...

1173
01:08:38.266 --> 01:08:39.867
Then I started to like him.

1174
01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:42.767
And now...

1175
01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:45.767
And now?

1176
01:08:59.667 --> 01:09:02.133
I was just opening
up to her. you know?

1177
01:09:02.266 --> 01:09:04.133
Finally. just someone.
letting her in.

1178
01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:07.633
And then the next
thing you know.

1179
01:09:07.767 --> 01:09:10.467
she's telling me. she already
knows and I should go public.

1180
01:09:12.934 --> 01:09:14.867
But I don't know if
I'm ready for all that.

1181
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.266
Well I hear you.
but maybe it's time.

1182
01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:20.200
Look. not everyone's
gonna believe me.

1183
01:09:20.333 --> 01:09:23.700
I don't want my life to turn
into a circus all over again.

1184
01:09:23.834 --> 01:09:25.066
Sometimes you just
have to face the things

1185
01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:26.767
you don't want to.

1186
01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:28.800
- Look who's talking.

1187
01:09:28.934 --> 01:09:31.533
It's a completely
different situation.

1188
01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:32.800
Yeah. right.

1189
01:09:32.934 --> 01:09:34.200
You have no idea
the pressure I feel.

1190
01:09:34.333 --> 01:09:37.066
And not just my dad.
from the whole island.

1191
01:09:41.567 --> 01:09:42.400
What?

1192
01:09:42.533 --> 01:09:43.467
Dude. you're like the mayor.

1193
01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.333
The whole island loves
you. man. whatever you do.

1194
01:09:54.066 --> 01:09:55.600
I'm here.

1195
01:09:55.734 --> 01:09:57.767
You have
anything you wanna tell me?

1196
01:09:57.900 --> 01:10:02.900
Nothing concrete. still
looking for confirmation.

1197
01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:04.834
So you really
like this guy. then?

1198
01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.533
I just need some more time.

1199
01:10:09.667 --> 01:10:11.367
This is news. big news.

1200
01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:13.700
and you know if the
situation were reversed.

1201
01:10:13.834 --> 01:10:16.767
you'd be saying the
same thing to me.

1202
01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:19.800
I love you. but I can only
hold off on this for so long.

1203
01:10:21.367 --> 01:10:22.133
Look. I gotta go.

1204
01:10:39.166 --> 01:10:40.467
Malcolm Elliot Jr.?

1205
01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:52.400
Good afternoon.

1206
01:10:53.834 --> 01:10:55.233
Afternoon.

1207
01:10:55.367 --> 01:10:58.100
We're looking for a gentleman
named Malcolm Elliot Jr.

1208
01:10:58.233 --> 01:11:00.367
By any chance would you know
where we could find him?

1209
01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:01.667
Never heard of him.

1210
01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:05.200
Ah. I believe he goes by the
name of Ford on the island.

1211
01:11:05.333 --> 01:11:06.333
Hm.

1212
01:11:06.467 --> 01:11:08.266
Is he a very short man?

1213
01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:11.767
Uh no. no. actually I
think he's pretty tall.

1214
01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:13.467
Does he have a mustache?

1215
01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:14.300
I don't know.

1216
01:11:14.433 --> 01:11:15.867
He could.

1217
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.066
Now. is he the one with
the three little dogs?

1218
01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:22.800
I dunno.

1219
01:11:22.934 --> 01:11:25.033
Well. I don't know him. then.

1220
01:11:27.166 --> 01:11:28.867
Thanks for your time.

1221
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.033
Come on.

1222
01:11:32.934 --> 01:11:36.200
Two nosy men here
looking for Ford.

1223
01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:48.567
Ford here.

1224
01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:49.834
Yeah. Ford. Hibbert.

1225
01:11:51.033 --> 01:11:52.033
I just wanna give
you a heads up.

1226
01:11:52.166 --> 01:11:53.467
How's that?

1227
01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:55.834
Two guys just
arrived on the island.

1228
01:11:55.967 --> 01:11:58.233
They were asking around
where to find you.

1229
01:11:58.367 --> 01:12:00.166
Some reporter type
and a camera guy.

1230
01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:04.066
Thanks. Hibbert.

1231
01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:05.333
Yeah. no worries.

1232
01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:10.033
So there's a
cameraman and reporter

1233
01:12:10.166 --> 01:12:12.066
who just water taxied
in looking for me.

1234
01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:13.734
Wait. what?

1235
01:12:13.867 --> 01:12:14.867
What are you talking about?

1236
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.100
You think it just magically
happened out nowhere?

1237
01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:24.433
Ford. where are you going?

1238
01:12:26.066 --> 01:12:28.567
Just leave the keys under
the mat before you go.

1239
01:12:48.166 --> 01:12:50.066
Courtney. how
could you do this?

1240
01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:51.967
You completely blindsided me.

1241
01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:52.900
Hold on.

1242
01:12:53.033 --> 01:12:55.266
What are you talking about?

1243
01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:56.700
A news reporter
and a cameraman

1244
01:12:56.834 --> 01:12:58.700
just arrived at the island.

1245
01:12:58.834 --> 01:13:00.200
What?

1246
01:13:00.333 --> 01:13:01.166
I can't believe you did this.

1247
01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:02.700
You didn't even warn me.

1248
01:13:02.834 --> 01:13:03.967
I didn't. I wouldn't.

1249
01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:04.834
I...

1250
01:13:05.667 --> 01:13:06.533
Hold on.

1251
01:13:06.667 --> 01:13:07.867
Tabitha?

1252
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.033
Why did a cameraman
and a reporter

1253
01:13:10.166 --> 01:13:11.667
just show up on Jade's vacation?

1254
01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:13.033
Because she's slipping.

1255
01:13:13.166 --> 01:13:14.100
Oh. come on.

1256
01:13:14.233 --> 01:13:15.667
Are you kidding me?

1257
01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:17.467
Ted was already in
Miami covering a story.

1258
01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:19.600
I sent him and a cameraman
over first thing.

1259
01:13:19.734 --> 01:13:20.934
I can't believe
you didn't tell me.

1260
01:13:21.066 --> 01:13:22.166
I can't believe you
were sitting on this.

1261
01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:24.934
But listen. his former boss
is about to run for governor

1262
01:13:25.066 --> 01:13:27.166
and no one's heard this
guy's side of the story.

1263
01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:29.934
It was a mistrial and the
case was never retried.

1264
01:13:30.066 --> 01:13:30.967
Why?

1265
01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:33.166
That's news. People need
to know what happened.

1266
01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:35.000
We still need the story. Jade.

1267
01:13:35.133 --> 01:13:37.934
Well. you'll have to
get it without me.

1268
01:13:38.066 --> 01:13:39.066
But...

1269
01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:26.266
Hi.

1270
01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:27.834
Hi.

1271
01:14:27.967 --> 01:14:29.834
I was going to leave
this at the house for Ford.

1272
01:14:29.967 --> 01:14:32.333
but I'm not sure when
he's coming back.

1273
01:14:32.467 --> 01:14:36.667
So would you mind
giving it to him for me?

1274
01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:37.567
Of course.

1275
01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:43.100
And I'm sorry that
you're leaving.

1276
01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:45.200
Me too.

1277
01:15:13.433 --> 01:15:14.767
Janelle.

1278
01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:15.667
Hey.

1279
01:15:16.967 --> 01:15:17.767
Hey.

1280
01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:23.533
I just. I just wanted to
say that I know how I am

1281
01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:27.066
and we don't always
see eye to eye

1282
01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:29.300
and I don't come home
often enough. but.

1283
01:15:30.767 --> 01:15:34.133
it's times like
these that I'm happy

1284
01:15:34.266 --> 01:15:35.800
to have a sister to talk to.

1285
01:15:35.934 --> 01:15:37.000
Is everything okay?

1286
01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:42.400
Yeah. I'm just
coming home for my trip

1287
01:15:42.533 --> 01:15:43.700
earlier than I thought.

1288
01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:47.333
Oh. I have so much to tell you.

1289
01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:51.266
I don't even know where
to start.

1290
01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:01.300
What?

1291
01:16:01.433 --> 01:16:02.533
Do you really think?
se sold you out?

1292
01:16:02.667 --> 01:16:04.500
Dude. a cameraman
and a reporter

1293
01:16:04.633 --> 01:16:05.266
magically show up on the island.

1294
01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:07.667
You think this is a coincidence?

1295
01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:09.400
Maybe it wasn't intentional.

1296
01:16:09.533 --> 01:16:10.900
Maybe it was.

1297
01:16:11.033 --> 01:16:12.233
This is my life here.

1298
01:16:12.367 --> 01:16:13.333
I've worked really
hard to build it.

1299
01:16:13.467 --> 01:16:17.133
You're an attorney who
runs a bike and cart shop.

1300
01:16:17.266 --> 01:16:18.533
And I like it.

1301
01:16:18.667 --> 01:16:20.133
In all the years
I've known you.

1302
01:16:20.266 --> 01:16:22.233
I've never seen you connect
with someone like this.

1303
01:16:22.367 --> 01:16:24.200
You're just gonna let her go?

1304
01:16:29.834 --> 01:16:34.033
She left this for you.

1305
01:16:38.667 --> 01:16:40.133
Dear Ford.

1306
01:16:40.266 --> 01:16:42.233
I'm sorry about
how things ended.

1307
01:16:42.367 --> 01:16:44.166
I didn't arrange it.

1308
01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:47.667
Just know your story is yours
to tell and in your own time.

1309
01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:49.333
I thought you
should know. though.

1310
01:16:49.467 --> 01:16:52.133
Clayton is announcing his
run for governor tonight.

1311
01:16:52.266 --> 01:16:55.300
I just wish we could have
had more time together.

1312
01:16:55.433 --> 01:16:56.533
Jade.

1313
01:16:56.667 --> 01:16:57.433
Jade left.

1314
01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:00.567
Her job sent a reporter
looking for Ford.

1315
01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:04.333
She said she
didn't arrange it.

1316
01:17:05.567 --> 01:17:06.800
You don't believe her?

1317
01:17:10.233 --> 01:17:11.233
Yeah. Yeah. I do.

1318
01:17:11.367 --> 01:17:12.433
I believe her.

1319
01:17:13.367 --> 01:17:15.934
Then as far as I can see.

1320
01:17:16.066 --> 01:17:18.066
you have been given the chance

1321
01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:21.133
to finally set
your path straight

1322
01:17:22.533 --> 01:17:25.400
and have a chance of a future

1323
01:17:25.533 --> 01:17:27.834
with a really lovely woman.

1324
01:17:27.967 --> 01:17:29.467
So what are you waiting for?

1325
01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:36.367
And as for you...

1326
01:17:38.367 --> 01:17:41.433
Don't think I don't know
what's going on with you.

1327
01:17:41.567 --> 01:17:46.300
It's time you had a
talk with your father.

1328
01:17:46.433 --> 01:17:48.233
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1329
01:17:48.367 --> 01:17:52.600
Yes. you do.

1330
01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:55.867
Goodbye.

1331
01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:15.367
Ford?

1332
01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:17.367
Hey. look. I changed my mind.

1333
01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:22.467
I'm doing the interview because
it's time. and I want to.

1334
01:18:24.467 --> 01:18:25.967
Okay. but I have one condition.

1335
01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:29.600
It has to be with you.

1336
01:18:31.834 --> 01:18:33.500
I thought you'd never ask.

1337
01:18:33.633 --> 01:18:35.400
So it's a yes?

1338
01:18:35.533 --> 01:18:37.367
It's a yes.

1339
01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:38.867
Are you sure?

1340
01:18:43.333 --> 01:18:44.600
Yes.

1341
01:18:44.734 --> 01:18:45.533
Let's do this.

1342
01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.433
"South side of the
island. 21 Zephyr Lane.

1343
01:18:58.567 --> 01:19:00.633
And Jade Taylor
says to step on it."

1344
01:19:01.934 --> 01:19:02.834
Thank you. Come on.

1345
01:19:06.934 --> 01:19:09.166
I know everything you
did for me was out of love.

1346
01:19:11.767 --> 01:19:14.600
I remember the day we put the
plaque out on my office door.

1347
01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:17.834
You were so proud.

1348
01:19:20.233 --> 01:19:21.400
I was.

1349
01:19:21.533 --> 01:19:23.467
I'm proud of this
restaurant. too.

1350
01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:24.500
What you've created.

1351
01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:26.667
The history.

1352
01:19:28.367 --> 01:19:29.300
And I love cooking.

1353
01:19:30.467 --> 01:19:31.633
I appreciate everything

1354
01:19:31.767 --> 01:19:33.700
you sacrificed for me
more than you know.

1355
01:19:36.567 --> 01:19:38.533
but I don't want you
to sell this place.

1356
01:19:41.066 --> 01:19:42.133
I wanna take it over.

1357
01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:49.600
Can you still be a
notary at the weekend?

1358
01:19:57.767 --> 01:19:58.533
Thanks. dad.

1359
01:20:02.734 --> 01:20:04.467
Yes. yes. Courtney.
I've got him.

1360
01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:05.633
He's ready.

1361
01:20:06.567 --> 01:20:07.667
Are you sure?

1362
01:20:09.133 --> 01:20:09.934
Very sure.

1363
01:20:13.533 --> 01:20:14.600
Okay. Jade.

1364
01:20:14.734 --> 01:20:16.700
Knock 'em out in three...

1365
01:20:22.633 --> 01:20:24.767
Thank you for sitting down
with me today. Mr. Elliot.

1366
01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:26.467
It's Malcolm. please.

1367
01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:28.767
I just wanna set
the record straight.

1368
01:20:28.900 --> 01:20:31.333
Four years ago. you
were the lead attorney

1369
01:20:31.467 --> 01:20:33.834
on the McAllister
money laundering case.

1370
01:20:33.967 --> 01:20:35.567
a case with clear cut evidence

1371
01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:37.934
and yet it ended in a mistrial.

1372
01:20:39.133 --> 01:20:42.133
Please. tell us your
side of the story.

1373
01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:47.433
My friend. my mentor.
DA George Clayton.

1374
01:20:47.567 --> 01:20:50.300
the man who was going
to officiate my wedding.

1375
01:20:50.433 --> 01:20:52.900
suddenly wouldn't allow
me to retry the case.

1376
01:20:53.033 --> 01:20:54.734
I held my tongue.

1377
01:20:54.867 --> 01:20:55.600
I was stuck.

1378
01:20:56.567 --> 01:20:59.133
And why did you decide
to come forward now?

1379
01:20:59.266 --> 01:21:02.200
Is it because you heard
that your former boss.

1380
01:21:02.333 --> 01:21:03.500
George Clayton. has announced

1381
01:21:03.633 --> 01:21:05.166
that he's running for governor?

1382
01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:07.433
No. I had no idea he was
running until just now.

1383
01:21:08.166 --> 01:21:09.300
Why am I taking this interview?

1384
01:21:09.433 --> 01:21:13.367
Well. when you decide you wanna
move forward with your life.

1385
01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:15.367
that you want to
start a new chapter.

1386
01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:17.900
the best chance of
being successful at that

1387
01:21:18.033 --> 01:21:23.033
is to let go of your past.
and I'm ready to do that.

1388
01:21:27.767 --> 01:21:28.433
DA George Clayton took the bribe

1389
01:21:28.567 --> 01:21:31.300
and then he leaked
the documents.

1390
01:21:31.433 --> 01:21:34.400
I had no idea until after the
case was declared a mistrial.

1391
01:21:36.033 --> 01:21:37.467
The McAllister's walked.

1392
01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:39.266
Malcolm. thank
you for your time.

1393
01:21:45.133 --> 01:21:47.066
That is a wrap right there.

1394
01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:48.367
That's a scoop.

1395
01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:50.066

was on vacation.

thinking after Jersey.

1413
01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:42.100
it's been a while
since I crossed

1414
01:22:42.233 --> 01:22:43.467
the river into the city.

1415
01:22:44.667 --> 01:22:45.633
Might be a great
place for me to look

1416
01:22:45.767 --> 01:22:47.300

1417
01:22:48.734 --> 01:22:50.166

She actually lives there.

1420
01:22:55.333 --> 01:22:58.700
You know. funny story. I
found her sleeping in my house

1421
01:22:58.834 --> 01:23:00.467
on Maceo Island one night.

1422
01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:02.367
She thought it was
a vacation rental.

1423
01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:04.967
Crazy.
