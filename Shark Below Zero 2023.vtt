00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:56.080
Um. this year there were
78 of them. 78 individuals.

859
00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:58.160
which is the most
we have seen in Canada

860
00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:59.840
since we started monitoring.

861
00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:01.200
MEGAN: That's crazy.

862
00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:04.120
Off of Cape Cod we detected 120.

863
00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:06.320
if that puts this
in perspective at all.

864
00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.960
That's a lot
of activity up here.

865
00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:12.680
NARRATOR: It's evidence Canada
is a white shark hot spot.

866
00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:16.200
particularly for
inexperienced juvenile sharks.

867
00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:20.960
And may explain why Canada
witnessed its first shark bite

868
00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:22.960
in 150 years.

869
00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:25.480
GREG: It's been
a phenomenal year for me.

870
00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:28.080
If you asked me a few years ago.

871
00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:30.160
what do you think about
white sharks in Canada?

872
00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:31.960
I'd say yes. they go there.

873
00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:37.360
but I didn't realize the.
the presence of these animals.

874
00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.200
These sharks are spreading out

875
00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:42.360
almost throughout
Canadian waters.

876
00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.320
This is an ancient animal.

877
00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:47.080
It's been around
for millions of years.

878
00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:49.840
It's a survivor
because it can adapt.

879
00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:52.480
and it will continue to adapt.

880
00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:55.440
We're going to keep seeing
white sharks off Canada.

881
00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:58.200
and quite possibly
we'll see more.
