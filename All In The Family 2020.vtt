11
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.300
- Yo. why was you at the
house last night. dog?

12
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.428

00:00:21.432 --> 00:00:22.265

15
00:00:22.265 --> 00:00:23.098
- [Man] I aint no snitch. boy.

16
00:00:23.098 --> 00:00:23.931
I don't know what you're talking about.

17
00:00:23.931 --> 00:00:24.764
- Hey yo. code green leprechaun.

18
00:00:24.764 --> 00:00:25.597
Let's get it.

19
00:00:25.597 --> 00:00:26.530
Huh. huh?

20
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.079
(overlapping chatter)

21
00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:32.496
(bell tolls)

22
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.050
- There's a time for everything.

23
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.830
A season for every activity under the sun.

24
00:00:45.242 --> 00:00:48.213
There's a time to be
born and a time to die.

25
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.773
A time to plant and a time to uproot.

26
00:00:55.403 --> 00:00:56.600
A time to kill.

27
00:00:57.703 --> 00:00:58.793
A time to heal.

28
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.973
A time to tear down.

29
00:01:02.935 --> 00:01:04.813
A time to build up.

30
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.413
Time to weep.

31
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.443
Time to laugh.

32
00:01:11.977 --> 00:01:13.413
A time to mourn.

33
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.783
A time to dance.

34
00:01:19.492 --> 00:01:21.825
Brothers and sisters. today.

35
00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:31.591
Is a day to mourn.

36
00:01:36.903 --> 00:01:41.903
We mourn today for our beloved
brother Michael Washington.

37
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.900
The earthly ties that bind us together

38
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.200
have forever been severed.

39
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.673
It can never be restored.

40
00:01:51.761 --> 00:01:53.928
(sobbing)

41
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.183
Michael has ascended.

42
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.093
Amen.

43
00:02:01.856 --> 00:02:04.440
I want to tell you something.

44
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.500
As the pastor of Mount Zion Church

45
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.060
to do funerals.

46
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.917
- [Woman] Yes.

47
00:02:09.917 --> 00:02:11.830
- And I can tell you.
brothers and sisters.

48
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.893
that I have done many many funerals.

49
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.613
But today. this funeral.

50
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.943
this funeral for Michael is personal.

51
00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:26.600
It touches me here.

52
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.820
- [Woman] Amen.

53
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.940
- You see. I've known Michael
since he was a little boy.

54
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.493
I saw his ultrasound.

55
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.810
Probably before anybody
else. other than the family.

56
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.610
Aretha came. she was happy.
she just showed it off.

57
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.347
I want to tell you something.

58
00:02:48.516 --> 00:02:51.144
It gave me great joy to know this boy.

59
00:02:51.144 --> 00:02:55.450
He was probably one of
the most behaved children

60
00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.077
that have ever come into my congregation.

61
00:02:58.077 --> 00:02:59.150
(crowd agreeing)

62
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.229
- Yes. he was.

63
00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:01.230
Yeah.

64
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.232
You said it.

65
00:03:02.232 --> 00:03:03.329
You say it.

66
00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.896
- In this church!
- Yes. sir.

67
00:03:05.896 --> 00:03:07.729
- Him and his brother.

68
00:03:09.393 --> 00:03:11.463
were tight. they were close.

69
00:03:12.543 --> 00:03:15.370
I never had to. Michael
come here and sit down.

70
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.930
Uh uh. not Michael.

71
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.563
'cause Michael was good.

72
00:03:19.563 --> 00:03:21.232
That was a good boy.

73
00:03:21.232 --> 00:03:23.580
Now. Sister Aretha

74
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.730
I know you wanted a quiet service

75
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.007
but your baby boy. Jerome.
has got something to say

76
00:03:31.007 --> 00:03:34.300
and I think we should indulge him.

77
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.133
Brother Jerome?

78
00:03:37.486 --> 00:03:38.950
Take the floor.

79
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:39.952
- Come on. J. you got this.

80
00:03:39.952 --> 00:03:41.360
You good.

81
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.943
- We're with you.
- You aight.

82
00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:48.675
- Take your time son. take your time.

83
00:03:52.093 --> 00:03:53.343
- Um. hi y'all.

84
00:03:55.354 --> 00:03:56.735
I'm Jerome.

85
00:03:56.735 --> 00:03:58.348
- Hi. Jerome.
- It's all right. baby.

86
00:03:58.348 --> 00:04:00.460
- Most of y'all knew me already but

87
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.910
aint know my brother Michael.

88
00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:04.660
He aint been around the church in awhile

89
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.603
and I know y'all haven't seen
me there in awhile neither.

90
00:04:09.051 --> 00:04:11.719
I don't know what happened to him.

91
00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:13.330
Not just that day in the streets

92
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.273
but months and months before. too.

93
00:04:16.858 --> 00:04:18.237
Michael and me. we've been drifting.

94
00:04:20.406 --> 00:04:21.886
- It's all right baby.
- I aint gonna deny it.

95
00:04:21.886 --> 00:04:23.210
- God's got you.
- Go on. talk about it.

96
00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.240
Talk about it.
- Go ahead.

97
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.173
- But my brother was a believer.

98
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.550
Just like me and my momma.

99
00:04:29.898 --> 00:04:32.210
It doesn't matter how long
its been since I talked to her

100
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.160
and Michael Washington.
he believed that there

101
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.084
was something more and I
pray deep down in my soul

102
00:04:40.084 --> 00:04:42.448
that that's where he is.

103
00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:44.050
- It's gonna be all right.
- And now we're all

104
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.880
left here to pick up the pieces.

105
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.229
But I'm gonna take care
of my momma and Keesha

106
00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:50.779
and if y'all could watch
their backs out here. too.

107
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.300
- Don't worry about it.
- We're here for you.

108
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.521
Yes. we're here for it.

109
00:04:57.521 --> 00:04:59.554
- I know Michael will. too.

110
00:04:59.554 --> 00:05:02.720
(overlapping talk in crowd)

111
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.053
(soft reflective music)

112
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.016
- It's gonna be all right.

113
00:05:09.016 --> 00:05:11.332
Bless him. lord. bless him.

114
00:05:11.332 --> 00:05:12.945
- [Woman] It's all right. baby.

115
00:05:12.945 --> 00:05:14.862
Its gonna be all right.

116
00:05:16.747 --> 00:05:20.167
- And Jerome. yes. we will
always take care of you

117
00:05:20.167 --> 00:05:21.670
and your mother and your family.

118
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.540
We will hold you close
in our hearts forever.

119
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.373
Yes we will.

120
00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.177
But now Michael's wife. his widow.

121
00:05:29.177 --> 00:05:31.523
would like a few words to say.

122
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.693
Before she comes. let's pray.

123
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.460
Soul of Jesus.

124
00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.270
- [All] Sanctify me.

125
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.768
- [Pastor] Body of Jesus.

126
00:05:43.768 --> 00:05:45.140
- [All] Save me.

127
00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.973
- Keesha.

128
00:05:45.973 --> 00:05:46.806
- Jerome.

129
00:05:46.806 --> 00:05:47.779
(shushes)

130
00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:48.612
- [Pastor] Blood of Christ.

131
00:05:48.612 --> 00:05:49.613
- [All] Strengthen me.

132
00:05:49.613 --> 00:05:50.446
- I know you lie.

133
00:05:50.446 --> 00:05:52.244
- Water from the side of Jesus.

134
00:05:52.244 --> 00:05:54.550
- [All] Watch me.

135
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:55.850
- Passion of Jesus.

136
00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.550
- [All] Strengthen me.

137
00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:58.820
- Oh Jesus. hear me lord.

138
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.210
- [All] Hear me.

139
00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.621
- Amen.
- Amen.

140
00:06:01.621 --> 00:06:02.871
- Amen.
- Amen.

141
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:04.940
- Amen.

142
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.323
Amen.
- Amen.

143
00:06:08.805 --> 00:06:13.780
- Sister Keesha. please.
we open ourselves up

144
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:14.863
to your words.

145
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.557
- Thank you. Pastor Rodney.

146
00:06:20.791 --> 00:06:21.923
- You're welcome.

147
00:06:22.945 --> 00:06:24.496
- Good morning. everyone.

148
00:06:24.496 --> 00:06:27.044
- Good morning.
- We love you Keesha.

149
00:06:27.044 --> 00:06:28.052
- Yes. yes.

150
00:06:28.052 --> 00:06:29.491
Yeah.

151
00:06:29.491 --> 00:06:31.800
- And I love you. too.

152
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.910
I love all of you.

153
00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.740
And you know I want to thank y'all

154
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.618
for all coming here for
me. Jerome. and Aretha.

155
00:06:38.618 --> 00:06:41.027
It means the world to us.

156
00:06:41.027 --> 00:06:42.540
But I got to keep it real. y'all.

157
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.673
this is not the hardest day
for me out of this whole thing.

158
00:06:45.673 --> 00:06:49.610
Like Michael was fading
away. he was getting distant.

159
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:50.570
You know but then the night

160
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:51.850
that whenever he didn't come home

161
00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.731
and then the next night
and then the next night.

162
00:06:53.731 --> 00:06:57.402
that was a secret I held on for so long.

163
00:06:57.402 --> 00:06:58.820
It was the hardest.

164
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.683
- Didn't tell us for two weeks
that Michael was missing.

165
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.620
What kind of woman--

166
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:04.550
- Mama.

167
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:05.980
We don't know what it was like.

168
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.460
- No. we don't.

169
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.810
Because she didn't tell us.

170
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.180
- [Keesha] But that's why the day his body

171
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.070
was found in the street was such a relief.

172
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.066
- I'm sorry. what she saying?

173
00:07:14.066 --> 00:07:15.272
(crowd grumbling)

174
00:07:15.272 --> 00:07:16.328
- What?

175
00:07:16.328 --> 00:07:17.161
- Like yeah like. see I
don't want to remember

176
00:07:17.161 --> 00:07:18.290
an idea we're all making up here.

177
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:19.896
I want us all to know the truth.

178
00:07:19.896 --> 00:07:21.600
Michael didn't hit me
or nothing like that.

179
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.711
I'm not finna say that.

180
00:07:22.711 --> 00:07:25.300
But he wasn't no husband.

181
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.810
I mean. he wasn't a bad man but I mean

182
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:29.591
he wasn't no good one.

183
00:07:29.591 --> 00:07:31.268
(crowd grumbling)

184
00:07:31.268 --> 00:07:32.456
You know what I'm saying?

185
00:07:32.456 --> 00:07:33.889
- [Man] I'll take care of you. Keesha.

186
00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:35.067
(crowd grumbling)

187
00:07:35.067 --> 00:07:35.900
- [Man] Did she really say that?

188
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.177
- [Keesha] But I know y'all
wasn't expecting this.

189
00:07:37.177 --> 00:07:38.177
- Did she really say that?

190
00:07:38.177 --> 00:07:39.350
- Honestly. I didn't know if
I was gonna even come up here

191
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:42.390
but I always keep it 100 and
I'm not about to change today.

192
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:43.780
- That no good little.

193
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.700
- A lot of y'all are sad
today remember what y'all

194
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.130
are thinking that
Michael was in your head.

195
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:51.158
- [Man] She got. I know
the heifer didn't say that.

196
00:07:51.158 --> 00:07:53.765
- But I'm also glad
that it's finally over.

197
00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:56.641
(crowd grumbling)

198
00:07:56.641 --> 00:07:58.492
- [Man] She got. I know
the heifer didn't say that.

199
00:07:58.492 --> 00:08:01.325
(crowd grumbling)

200
00:08:03.179 --> 00:08:04.012
- [Woman] What?

201
00:08:04.012 --> 00:08:04.845
Girl.

202
00:08:04.845 --> 00:08:06.666
Wait a minute (shushes)
let me hear. let me hear.

203
00:08:06.666 --> 00:08:08.077
- That's all I got to say. though.

204
00:08:08.077 --> 00:08:09.125
- [Man] That heifer said that?

205
00:08:09.125 --> 00:08:11.958
(crowd grumbling)

206
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:16.743
- We gonna pray. we
gonna have to leave now.

207
00:08:18.783 --> 00:08:21.050
The ushers have prepared some refreshments

208
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.910
for us downstairs.
- She's a hot one.

209
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:26.940
- Please the join the
family with fellowship

210
00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.210
and repass right after this.

211
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:30.043
- You know what I mean. bro?

212
00:08:30.043 --> 00:08:32.567
I feel like we were right on the brink

213
00:08:32.567 --> 00:08:36.221
of solving the code man.
we're like right there.

214
00:08:36.221 --> 00:08:38.202
Hey. how y'all doing. how y'all doing?

215
00:08:38.202 --> 00:08:39.206
- Thank you so much for coming.

216
00:08:39.206 --> 00:08:40.706
Thank you so much.

217
00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:44.470
- Hey man. you almost
cracked the code. bro.

218
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:46.110
I'm telling you. man.
you know what I'm saying.

219
00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:47.803
like you know. I like to say.

220
00:08:47.803 --> 00:08:49.707
life is like a Rubik's Cube. bro.

221
00:08:49.707 --> 00:08:51.110
You just got to have the right--

222
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:52.480
- Algorithm. right?

223
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.313
Right. algorithm.
- You know what I mean?

224
00:08:53.313 --> 00:08:55.387
Just find the. find the. find the rhythm.

225
00:08:55.387 --> 00:08:56.220
The alger.

226
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.490
- The algorithm.

227
00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.424
- The algorithm baby. come on now.

228
00:08:59.424 --> 00:09:00.707
You know what to do.

229
00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:02.330
- Yeah but this girl. Keesha. man.

230
00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.510
it's like. we'll talk about one thing

231
00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:08.110
and then. she'll just do
the complete opposite. bro.

232
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:09.910
Like Kevin. I don't think you get it. bro.

233
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:12.232
Like. we'll agree on one
thing and then she wants

234
00:09:12.232 --> 00:09:14.005
to do her own thing.

235
00:09:14.005 --> 00:09:15.307
- Facts. that's facts. that's facts.

236
00:09:15.307 --> 00:09:16.140
But you got it. though.

237
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:17.040
You a smart. you know what I mean.

238
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.010
so it's only a matter of time before.

239
00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:20.970
you know. crack the code
and do what you got to do

240
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.180
but you know what I'm saying.

241
00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.796
just keep your foundation intact

242
00:09:23.796 --> 00:09:24.800
and you can't--

243
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.203
- Yeah but Keesha acts like she don't know

244
00:09:26.203 --> 00:09:27.036
how to know say. man.

245
00:09:27.036 --> 00:09:28.107
Yo. so when should I even talk to her like

246
00:09:28.107 --> 00:09:30.310
'cause I aint feeling it today. man.

247
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:32.250
- No. no I think she over there right now.

248
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.550
You might just want to
holler at her right now. bro.

249
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:35.660
But you already know what to do. bro.

250
00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:36.910
You know what to lock in.

251
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.504
I mean there's no time like the present.

252
00:09:38.504 --> 00:09:39.993
The present is the gift.

253
00:09:39.993 --> 00:09:43.420
Its around Kwanza time.
you know what I'm saying.

254
00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.180
so its time to go.

255
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.334
- You're saying handle it right now?

256
00:09:46.334 --> 00:09:47.346
- I think you should for real go.

257
00:09:47.346 --> 00:09:48.179
- Find the algorithm right now?

258
00:09:48.179 --> 00:09:49.012
- Let's get it. let's get it. bro.

259
00:09:49.012 --> 00:09:50.402
You got that.

260
00:09:50.402 --> 00:09:51.235
You got that.

261
00:09:51.235 --> 00:09:52.068
My man. no doubt.

262
00:09:52.068 --> 00:09:53.570
All right. all right. all right.

263
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:55.270
- [Keesha] Girl. Jerome
won't even look at me now.

264
00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:58.270
- Listen. Keesha. this was your truth.

265
00:09:58.270 --> 00:09:59.511
If that's how you was feeling.

266
00:09:59.511 --> 00:10:01.060
then that's what it is.

267
00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.780
- Keesha. you aint tell me you
were gonna say none of that.

268
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:05.430
Come on. girl. just in my mama's face?

269
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.450
- Jerome. calm the hell down.

270
00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:10.253
- Brianna. you aint a part of this.

271
00:10:10.253 --> 00:10:13.500
- I'm just saying. you always

272
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.980
It aint that serious. chill out.

273
00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:16.286

So I'ma need you to step.

276
00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.429

277
00:10:21.429 --> 00:10:22.560
- Okay. okay. okay y'all.

278
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.058
- Aint nobody stepping nowhere.

279
00:10:24.058 --> 00:10:25.060
Make me step.

280
00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.064
- I'm gonna just see
you tonight. all right.

281
00:10:26.064 --> 00:10:27.339
- You aint gonna do nothing. Jerome.

282
00:10:27.339 --> 00:10:28.301
You aint about that life.

283
00:10:28.301 --> 00:10:29.134
- I'm gonna see you tonight. girl. aight.

284
00:10:29.134 --> 00:10:29.967
- Yeah. we gonna see tonight.

00:10:29.967 --> 00:10:30.920
I'm gonna see you tonight.

286
00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.278
We gonna see.
- I'm gonna see you tonight.

287
00:10:32.278 --> 00:10:33.310
Look. chill.

288
00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:34.230
- Yo. Keesha that was--

289
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.077
- You know I got to say what I feel.

290
00:10:35.077 --> 00:10:36.373
That's the way I've always been.

291
00:10:36.373 --> 00:10:38.440
I aint got to lie to nobody.

292
00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.540
- Keesha you don't got to lie.

293
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.700
You just got to keep your mouth shut.

294
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:41.853
- Excuse me?

295
00:10:41.853 --> 00:10:43.150
Who are you telling to
keep they mouth shut?

296
00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.690
- I'm just saying. Keesha.

297
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:46.150
you don't got to put words in my mouth

298
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:47.290
or my mama's.

299
00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.030
This whole thing got me so confused.

300
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:50.335
I don't know how I'm feeling or nothing.

301
00:10:50.335 --> 00:10:51.390
- Jerome. he just stopped talking

302
00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:53.630
and then you know he was working
down at that gas station.

303
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:55.120
coming home with $50 in scratch tickets

304
00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.847
smelling like liquor. smelling like weed

305
00:10:56.847 --> 00:10:57.854
and all that shit like that

306
00:10:57.854 --> 00:10:59.087
hanging out with them shady characters.

307
00:10:59.087 --> 00:11:01.050
- Nah. Jerome was gonna
start that foundation.

308
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:03.530
Boy him and me talked
about since we was little.

309
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:05.860
- Yeah. yeah okay yes
swimming. basketball. homework.

310
00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.540
yeah I heard this speech before
and that's all it ever was.

311
00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:09.880
- He told me took out a loan.

312
00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.890
He got cleared for some money

313
00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:12.040
and that he was gonna start stuff up.

314
00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:12.940
For real this time.

315
00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.648
- Uh I thought you two
wasn't talking. though?

316
00:11:14.648 --> 00:11:16.995
- Not much but he called me all excited

317
00:11:16.995 --> 00:11:19.140
and I thought things were
gonna start being different

318
00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.740
this time but then this
dude disappears again.

319
00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.080
I don't get it. Keesha.

320
00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.040
I just don't get it.

321
00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.010
- You know he was. J.

322
00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:26.710
he talked and talked and talked

323
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:28.040
but when he woke up the next morning

324
00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.210
he didn't remember shit.

325
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:31.290
It wasn't you. it was him.

326
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:33.960
- Well what about that money?

327
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.081
You got to know about that. too. though.

328
00:11:35.081 --> 00:11:36.520
- Man. look. I don't know
nothing about no loan.

329
00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.570
Maybe he said something when he was drunk

330
00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:39.403
or something like that.

331
00:11:39.403 --> 00:11:40.236
In fact. he got it from one

332
00:11:40.236 --> 00:11:41.490
of them people at the gas station.

333
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.050
I don't know. I don't
know who he's been talking

334
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:43.883
to lately. seriously.

335
00:11:43.883 --> 00:11:44.716
- Jerome.

336
00:11:46.145 --> 00:11:47.623
A word.

337
00:11:49.288 --> 00:11:50.288
- Oh my god.

338
00:11:55.447 --> 00:11:56.350
- Mama--

339
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:57.940
- She talking more junk?

340
00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.590
- Nah. mama.

341
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.100
She's hurting too. its complicated.

342
00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.410
- Yeah that's what I've been
telling everyone inside.

343
00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:05.550
Lord help me. I think they believe it.

344
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:06.840
- And you don't?

345
00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.374
- She can think what she thinks

346
00:12:08.374 --> 00:12:10.900
but that little girl needs to grow up

347
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:14.060
and realize that today
is not at all about her.

348
00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:14.893
- She knows that.

349
00:12:14.893 --> 00:12:16.414
- I don't think so. Jerome.

350
00:12:16.414 --> 00:12:19.131
- Mama. why you always gotta be like this?

351
00:12:19.131 --> 00:12:19.964
- Me?

352
00:12:19.964 --> 00:12:21.392
- You know how Michael was getting.

353
00:12:21.392 --> 00:12:23.172
- I know my boy.

354
00:12:23.172 --> 00:12:27.510
He was lost but he was
finding his way back.

355
00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:28.930
- She knows that. too.

356
00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:29.763
Just give her time.

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:36.003
Like are you fucking kidding me?

395

share your love with others.

719
00:24:28.612 --> 00:24:30.593
- Even if you have a broken heart?

720
00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:35.830
- The lord saves those with a broken heart

721
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:39.363
and he saves those who
are crushed in the spirit.

722
00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:41.703
- Psalms 33.

723
00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.383
- 34 but you were real close.

724
00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:51.470
- Can I get you anything?

725
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.390
Coffee. tea?

726
00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:55.946
- Coffee.

727
00:24:55.946 --> 00:24:57.600
Black.

728
00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.441
- I know how you like it.

729
00:24:59.441 --> 00:25:00.330
- I know you do.

730
00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:02.840
- Jerome. you better say
good afternoon to the pastor.

731
00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:03.673
- Afternoon. Pastor Rodney.

732
00:25:03.673 --> 00:25:04.506
- Good afternoon. Jerome.

733
00:25:04.506 --> 00:25:06.850
- And you think you gonna
run out of this house

734
00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:07.683
without kissing your mama?

735
00:25:07.683 --> 00:25:09.330
- I'm not a kid. ma.

736
00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:11.290
I'm a grown ass man and I got stuff to do.

737
00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:13.026
- Boy. you better not be sassing me.

738
00:25:13.026 --> 00:25:14.627
I brought you into this world

739
00:25:14.627 --> 00:25:17.080
and lord knows I will
bring you up out of it

740
00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.880
faster than the white man
run up out of the North End.

741
00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.140
Now give me a kiss.

742
00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:21.973
- Mama.

743
00:25:21.973 --> 00:25:22.806
- Jerome.

744
00:25:29.874 --> 00:25:32.110
- Jerome. Jerome. now you know your mama

745
00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:34.700
is one of the most stubborn
women in this whole county.

746
00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:36.170
probably the whole state.

747
00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:37.690
- And proud of it.

748
00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:38.940
- Let me give you some advice.

749
00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:40.667
A pastor to man. pastor to man.

750
00:25:40.667 --> 00:25:42.159
Do what your mama tell you to do

751
00:25:42.159 --> 00:25:45.360
and you'll wake up tomorrow morning.

752
00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.400
- Michael didn't.

753
00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.233
- Jerome!

754
00:25:47.233 --> 00:25:49.190
Now you know that wasn't
even necessary. man.

755
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:50.023
- I got to go.

756
00:25:50.023 --> 00:25:51.260
- Jerome!

757
00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:53.460
- He's so angry.

758
00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.830
- I know.

759
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:56.542
- All the time.

760
00:25:56.542 --> 00:25:58.890
- It's to be expected.

761
00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:01.173
- But Rodney. I'm angry. too.

762
00:26:01.173 --> 00:26:02.290
I'm angry. too.

763
00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:04.640
- Aretha. you have
every right to be angry.

764
00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:07.030
- Every morning I wake up and ask god

765
00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:09.570
why my Michael had to be taken away.

766
00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:11.220
why my little boy had to go.

767
00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:12.200
- Aretha--

768
00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.520
- But God doesn't answer me. Rodney.

769
00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.300
He doesn't answer me.

770
00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:19.270
- Aretha. the lord works
in mysterious ways.

771
00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:21.620
- Well the least he could
do is give me a clue.

772
00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.160
- Thank you so much.

773
00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:30.150
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

774
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:32.869
- Oh no.

775
00:26:32.869 --> 00:26:33.702
Uh. no.

776
00:26:33.702 --> 00:26:35.599
That's bad. that's bad. Aretha.

777
00:26:35.599 --> 00:26:36.603
That's horrible.

778
00:26:36.603 --> 00:26:37.613
- You're a handful. Rodney.

779
00:26:37.613 --> 00:26:40.530
- As bad as I was back
when we was in school?

780
00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:41.497
- Worse.

781
00:26:41.497 --> 00:26:43.747
(laughing)

782
00:26:44.654 --> 00:26:47.627
- Aretha. let me ask you something.

783
00:26:47.627 --> 00:26:49.423
I'm serious now. okay.

784
00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:52.849
Are you starting to lose your faith?

785
00:26:52.849 --> 00:26:57.087
- No. I don't. I don't think so.

786
00:26:57.087 --> 00:26:59.010
- That's good cause if you were--

787
00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:00.730
- I believe in God.

788
00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:01.563
- I know you do.

789
00:27:03.198 --> 00:27:06.070
- It's just sometimes I don't
think he believes in me.

790
00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:08.550
- What do you mean. why?

791
00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:10.480
- I have gone to church every Sunday

792
00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.428
since I was a little girl.

793
00:27:12.428 --> 00:27:16.189
The little girl in braids
up front at the balcony.

794
00:27:16.189 --> 00:27:19.776
I have gone every Sunday. Rodney.

795
00:27:19.776 --> 00:27:23.920
Lord knows I'm devoted. honest. loyal.

796
00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:24.753
- Strong.

797
00:27:25.746 --> 00:27:28.520
- And then my children.

798
00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:32.310
my community. I have given
everything that I have

799
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:34.612
to give to the Lord and his glory

800
00:27:34.612 --> 00:27:37.840
and when the man that I
thought shared my values

801
00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:42.090
and beliefs. he took a trip
down to the gas station

802
00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:43.580
and never came back.

803
00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.766
I thought God was punishing me.

804
00:27:45.766 --> 00:27:46.973
- Why?

805
00:27:47.833 --> 00:27:49.220
(somber piano music)

806
00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:51.820
- I thought something was wrong with me.

807
00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:53.582
- You never told me that. Aretha.

808
00:27:53.582 --> 00:27:55.283
- I never told anybody.

809
00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:58.720
I thought there was
something wrong with me.

810
00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.340
that I wasn't good enough.

811
00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:03.120
So I prayed and prayed and prayed

812
00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.890
and asked God for guidance and direction.

813
00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:09.750
that he would protect my
sons from turning out to be

814
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:11.493
like their daddy was.

815
00:28:11.493 --> 00:28:12.740
- And he did. Aretha.

816
00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:14.691
- Did he. Rodney?

817
00:28:14.691 --> 00:28:16.070
- Yes.

818
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:18.810
- Because my first baby boy
was found dead in the street

819
00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:22.381
two weeks ago and my house
was broken into by that man.

820
00:28:22.381 --> 00:28:24.090
- This house?

821
00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:25.570
Broken into last night?

822
00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:27.384
- Round about 12 midnight.

823
00:28:27.384 --> 00:28:30.030
I came downstairs for a glass of water

824
00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:32.803
and there was some commotion
going on down here.

825
00:28:32.803 --> 00:28:34.550
- Did y'all call the cops?

826
00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:36.930
- Jerome grabbed a bat
and chased whomever it was

827
00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:37.763
up out of here.

828
00:28:37.763 --> 00:28:39.730
- A bat. a baseball bat?

829
00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:42.280
- I know there has to be
a connection to Michael.

830
00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.259
- Why you say that?

831
00:28:43.259 --> 00:28:46.062
- Because all the
nonsense he was going to.

832
00:28:46.062 --> 00:28:48.443
He was so secretive.

833
00:28:48.443 --> 00:28:51.107
- Secrets. what secrets. Aretha?

834
00:28:51.107 --> 00:28:53.610
- I just didn't recognize him anymore.

835
00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:55.330
I don't even know who he is

836
00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:58.121
but I pray Jerome does
not go down that path.

837
00:28:58.121 --> 00:28:59.276
- Aretha. Aretha.

838
00:28:59.276 --> 00:29:01.022
Listen to me.

839
00:29:01.022 --> 00:29:03.981
Jerome is a good man.

840
00:29:03.981 --> 00:29:05.683
He's pure at heart.

841
00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.653
- Good men do bad things. Rodney.

842
00:29:11.892 --> 00:29:14.233
- Aretha. listen to me.

843
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:18.958
Look at me. Aretha.

844
00:29:18.958 --> 00:29:21.041
Forgiveness. forgiveness.

845
00:29:23.827 --> 00:29:24.994
- Forgiveness.

846
00:29:25.887 --> 00:29:28.970
(somber piano music)

847
00:29:29.993 --> 00:29:32.483
I'ma take this nasty
coffee up out of here.

848
00:29:32.483 --> 00:29:34.040
- You gonna make some more though. right?

849
00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.190
- I'm not talking to you. Rodney.

850
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:37.277
- Make some. just change the filter.

851
00:29:37.277 --> 00:29:39.681
All you got to do is change
the filter and add some water.

852
00:29:39.681 --> 00:29:42.083
- There's only so much a mother can do.

853
00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:44.260
- I understand. Aretha.

854
00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.340
I really do.

855
00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:49.670
- When was the last time
Jerome was up at the church?

856
00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:51.140
- Sunday.

857
00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:52.770
- What do you mean?

858
00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:54.150
- He was there Sunday.

859
00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:55.460
- He hasn't been to service with me

860
00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:57.940
since he and Michael were both teenagers.

861
00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:00.420
- I didn't say anything
about service. Aretha.

862
00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:04.437
Listen. see.

863
00:30:04.437 --> 00:30:07.800
At the church. you know we
going through the hard times.

864
00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:11.042
you know. we're short
staffed. collections are low.

865
00:30:11.042 --> 00:30:14.280
So a lot of things we
have to do ourself. okay.

866
00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.913
so I'm there. you know. every
Sunday I'm always there late.

867
00:30:16.913 --> 00:30:19.848
There was one Sunday about a year ago.

868
00:30:19.848 --> 00:30:22.734
I was coming out of my study

869
00:30:22.734 --> 00:30:26.370
and I walk into the
sanctuary and there he was.

870
00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:27.203
- Pastor.

871
00:30:27.203 --> 00:30:29.040
- Jerome was sitting
right there in the pew.

872
00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:29.970
He was praying

873
00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:34.410
and I walked up to him and
it sounded like he was trying

874
00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:36.281
to find himself.

875
00:30:36.281 --> 00:30:37.700
- Jerome?

876
00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:39.017
- Yes Jerome.

877
00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:41.320
So I just stood there.

878
00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.111
I stood there with him

879
00:30:43.111 --> 00:30:45.440
and then he asked me. he said. he said

880
00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.400
Pastor is there anything that I can do.

881
00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.263
anyway that I can serve the lord?

882
00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:52.870
And so we talked for a little bit

883
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:56.670
and we prayed and he's been
coming back to this church

884
00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:59.620
every Sunday after service.

885
00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:02.540
He maintains things that
need to be maintained.

886
00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:05.169
He fixes things so that they don't break.

887
00:31:05.169 --> 00:31:08.262
Aretha. the boy is here every Sunday.

888
00:31:08.262 --> 00:31:11.145
- Rodney. why haven't you told me this?

889
00:31:11.145 --> 00:31:12.062
- Aretha...

890
00:31:14.897 --> 00:31:19.897
You know each man has to
navigate these waters for himself

891
00:31:20.074 --> 00:31:22.653
just like each woman has to.

892
00:31:24.178 --> 00:31:27.470
But look here. let me tell you something.

893
00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:31.260
I'll keep an eye out for him. Aretha.

894
00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:32.560
I promise you.

895
00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:33.887
- Thank you. pastor.

896
00:31:33.887 --> 00:31:37.724
- Everybody needs somebody
to look out for 'em.

897
00:31:37.724 --> 00:31:38.891

00:43:34.462 --> 00:43:36.230

You know what I'm saying?

1416
00:48:57.986 --> 00:48:59.700
It's like step number one is ABP.

- Wow.

1539
00:53:40.775 --> 00:53:43.275
You're nothing but consistent.

You all right. son?

1541
00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:48.730
You looked troubled.

1542
00:53:48.730 --> 00:53:50.490
- Don't I always?

1543
00:53:50.490 --> 00:53:51.640
- Depends on the night.

1544
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:55.704
- I made a lot of mistakes. Pastor.

1545
00:53:55.704 --> 00:53:57.740
- They're part of the journey.

1546
00:53:57.740 --> 00:53:59.893
- And where does this
journey lead to. Pastor?

1547
00:54:02.258 --> 00:54:03.658
- Let me tell you something.

1548
00:54:06.110 --> 00:54:08.520
When you were a little boy.

1549
00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:12.880
you and your brother used
to run allover this church.

1550
00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:15.313
Wherever Michael was there was Jerome.

1551
00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:19.362
You all found places in this church

1552
00:54:19.362 --> 00:54:20.820
that we didn't even know existed.

1553
00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:21.897
Did you know that?

1554
00:54:24.521 --> 00:54:27.727
Can I tell you something. son?

1555
00:54:27.727 --> 00:54:31.200
A few Sundays before Michael disappeared.

1556
00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:33.150
a few weeks before Michael disappeared.

1557
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:36.930
he was right here in this church.

1558
00:54:36.930 --> 00:54:37.920
- What?
- Yeah.

1559
00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:38.753
sitting right over there.

1560
00:54:38.753 --> 00:54:40.657
We sat over there. we talked.

1561
00:54:40.657 --> 00:54:44.320
Yeah. he came before
you usually showed up.

1562
00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:45.913
We had a nice long talk.

1563
00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:50.023
He told me had some regrets in his life.

1564
00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:55.650
How he regretted not being
there for you and your mother

1565
00:54:55.650 --> 00:54:56.910
like he wanted to be

1566
00:54:57.890 --> 00:55:00.590
and how the lifestyle that he was living.

1567
00:55:00.590 --> 00:55:03.577
you know. made it difficult
for him to reach to you all

1568
00:55:03.577 --> 00:55:05.713
and for you all to reach out to him.

1569
00:55:07.052 --> 00:55:08.467
It really bothered him.

1570
00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:12.581
You know what else he told me?

1571
00:55:12.581 --> 00:55:16.117
He said that he looked
up to he. he admired you.

1572
00:55:18.491 --> 00:55:19.525
Yeah.

1573
00:55:19.525 --> 00:55:20.358
- Yeah right.

1574
00:55:20.358 --> 00:55:21.330
- That's true.

1575
00:55:21.330 --> 00:55:23.380
You know. many people
thought that it was you

1576
00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:26.483
who looked up to him. you
wanted to be like him.

1577
00:55:27.442 --> 00:55:29.292
But it was just the other way around.

1578
00:55:32.550 --> 00:55:35.777
Son. he really loved you.

1579
00:55:38.530 --> 00:55:41.619
- Pastor I got. I got to tell you.

1580
00:55:41.619 --> 00:55:43.470
- What. about Keesha?

1581
00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:44.940
Yeah. I knew about her.

1582
00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:46.340
I've always known about her.

1583
00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:48.223
- Did Michael know?

1584
00:55:48.223 --> 00:55:49.920
- No. Michael never knew.

1585
00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:51.120
- Wait. then how?

1586
00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:52.003
- How did I know?

1587
00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:55.036
Son listen. let me tell you something.

1588
00:55:55.036 --> 00:55:57.020
when you have dealt with the lord

1589
00:55:57.020 --> 00:56:00.150
the way that I have over
all these past years

1590
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:01.620
and when you've had to deal with people

1591
00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:04.146
the way that I've had to deal with people.

1592
00:56:04.146 --> 00:56:07.643
you learn a few things. a few
things are revealed to you.

1593
00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:14.403
- Well. Pastor I know it's wrong.

1594
00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:17.020
- That may be true.

1595
00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:18.360
- But I feel like it's my fault he's gone.

1596
00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:21.063
- No. no. no that's definitely not true.

1597
00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:28.853
Michael loved you. that's a fact.

1598
00:56:31.610 --> 00:56:33.882
- Pastor. I don't even know how to--

1599
00:56:33.882 --> 00:56:35.799
- What. what son. what?

1600
00:56:37.368 --> 00:56:38.201
Jerome.

1601
00:56:39.890 --> 00:56:41.440
Jerome. what do you want to do?

1602
00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:44.390
What does your mother want you to do?

1603
00:56:47.026 --> 00:56:52.026
Son. I'm not trying to
force you to do anything.

1604
00:56:53.129 --> 00:56:54.906
I would never do that.

1605
00:56:54.906 --> 00:56:57.870
I'm not gonna try and
force you to be anything

1606
00:56:57.870 --> 00:56:59.625
or any way. think anyway

1607
00:56:59.625 --> 00:57:03.303
but I want you to be true to yourself.

1608
00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:06.173
Be true to your mother.

1609
00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:09.963
Because God sees everything.

1610
00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:16.253
Truth is the way of the light.

1611
00:57:18.090 --> 00:57:20.650
Son. look I got to get ready to go.

00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:25.230
You gonna be all right?

1616
00:57:25.230 --> 00:57:26.063

- You as well. Pastor.

1622
00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:35.073
- All right. let me hurry up.

1623
00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:52.383
- Keesha. I. listen. we have to talk.

1624
00:58:06.691 --> 00:58:07.923

1625
00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:10.908
- Keesha. what are you doing here?

1626
00:58:10.908 --> 00:58:12.010
How did you get in here?

1627
00:58:12.010 --> 00:58:14.350
- You know I got a spare key.

1628
00:58:14.350 --> 00:58:16.210
- But it's after midnight.

1629
00:58:16.210 --> 00:58:18.740
- I got a clock. J. I

1630
00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:20.420
- Listen. Brianna--

1631
00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:21.600

1633
00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:25.768
- Keesha brought me.

1634
00:58:25.768 --> 00:58:27.500
- Yeah. baby.

1635
00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:29.430
Now what was you gonna say about Brianna?

1636
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:31.580
- Keesha. we need to talk for a second.

1637
00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:33.097
- But we are talking.

1638
00:58:33.097 --> 00:58:34.770
- Alone.

1639
00:58:34.770 --> 00:58:37.340
- Oh baby. but you don't
want to be rude to Brianna.

1640
00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:38.730
- Does my mama know you're--

1641
00:58:38.730 --> 00:58:39.973
- Course I do. baby.

1642
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:44.590
These two ladies and I have been chatting.

1643
00:58:44.590 --> 00:58:45.460
- Chatting?

1644
00:58:45.460 --> 00:58:47.720

00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:03.700

1651
00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:05.320
you've been putting yourself through today

1652
00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:07.185
looking into Michael's business.

1653
00:59:07.185 --> 00:59:09.768
(somber music)

1654
00:59:12.194 --> 00:59:14.922
You need to take care of yourself.

1655
00:59:14.922 --> 00:59:17.274
He made his choice. Jerome.

1656
00:59:17.274 --> 00:59:18.173
- Yeah. J.

1657
00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:24.400
- They're letting me
know they care about you.

1658
00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:25.703
Just like me.

1659
00:59:28.010 --> 00:59:30.093
Well. it's well past my bedtime.

1660
00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:35.400
I won't lie.

1661
00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:38.180
Y'all sure had me scared
thinking y'all some intruders

1662
00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:39.703
when I came downstairs.

1663
00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:42.190
But I'm glad you two came.

1664
00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:47.603
If you need me. Jerome.
I'll be right here.

1665
00:59:55.410 --> 00:59:56.978
- What's going on?

1666
00:59:56.978 --> 00:59:58.760
- What you mean?

1667
00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:00.940
- Keesha. I. Brianna. she the one.

1668
01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:02.560
She paid the guy to bust up in here.

1669
01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:04.550
- What. Jerome you sound crazy.

1670
01:00:04.550 --> 01:00:07.300
- Yeah. Jerome. what
are you talking about?

1671
01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:08.133
- Really?

1672
01:00:08.133 --> 01:00:09.805
Because I know for a fact you was.

1673
01:00:09.805 --> 01:00:11.570
- You done lost your damn mind.

1674
01:00:11.570 --> 01:00:13.020
- Why the hell would you do this?

1675
01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:14.640
This don't make any damn sense.

1676
01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:15.550
- Come on. J.

1677
01:00:15.550 --> 01:00:16.790
You need to use your brain.

1678
01:00:16.790 --> 01:00:18.290
Don't be making accusations like that.

1679
01:00:18.290 --> 01:00:19.240
- Listen.

1680
01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:20.550
- You know something. J.

1681
01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:23.190
the strangest thing
happened about an hour ago.

1682
01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:25.800
I got a message on my
phone from your number

1683
01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:27.690
and a voice that sounded a lot like yours

1684
01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:30.846
saying that they didn't
want to be with me no more.

1685
01:00:30.846 --> 01:00:32.199
Aint that funny. Jerome?

1686
01:00:32.199 --> 01:00:35.200
- Keesha. this aint the way.

1687
01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:38.440
- 'cause why would a man
say no to me. you feel me?

1688
01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:41.510
- Keesha. what we've been
doing. it's not right.

1689
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:42.560
It's not right.

1690
01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:44.410
- You scared baby. I see it.

1691
01:00:44.410 --> 01:00:45.243
I feel it.

1692
01:00:45.243 --> 01:00:47.980
You've been acting different
ever since Michael was found.

1693
01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:51.517
But I did this for us. for me and you.

1694
01:00:53.913 --> 01:00:55.560
- What you say?

1695
01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:57.410
- You don't got to be
scared no more. baby.

1696
01:00:57.410 --> 01:01:00.062
- Nah. nah Keesha. you
said something else. too.

1697
01:01:00.062 --> 01:01:02.230
- Nah. you hearing things.

1698
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:04.590
- What you mean you did it all for us?

1699
01:01:04.590 --> 01:01:06.410
- So yeah. J. I got that voicemail

1700
01:01:06.410 --> 01:01:08.760
and you want to know what
I did when I got it? '

1701
01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:11.890
I laughed and then I called
Bri and she laughed with me

1702
01:01:11.890 --> 01:01:13.475
and you want to know why?

1703
01:01:13.475 --> 01:01:15.725
'Cause it was funny.

1704
01:01:15.725 --> 01:01:18.270
It's a joke. it had to be a joke

1705
01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:20.310
'cause if it wasn't a
joke what kind of man

1706
01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:22.020
would call it off with a woman this good?

1707
01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:25.080
- Yeah. what kind of man
gonna do that. Jerome?

1708
01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:27.023
- And that's why I laughed.
J. 'cause I knew it was a joke

1709
01:01:27.023 --> 01:01:28.650
and if you wasn't joking you

1710
01:01:28.650 --> 01:01:30.150
better start reevaluating yourself

1711
01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:31.250
'cause I didn't put in all this work

1712
01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:33.093
for you to act like
this is all for nothing.

1713
01:01:33.093 --> 01:01:34.060
- Keesha. what are you talking bout?

1714
01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:35.360
- Our future. J.

1715
01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:36.193
Me and you.

1716
01:01:36.193 --> 01:01:38.083
- Keesha. if you think
there's a future between us

1717
01:01:38.083 --> 01:01:39.872
then you better start
telling me the truth.

1718
01:01:39.872 --> 01:01:40.873
Spill.

1719
01:01:42.346 --> 01:01:44.050
- Oh okay.

1720
01:01:45.064 --> 01:01:46.300
Alright. baby.

1721
01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:47.163
Well here you go.

1722
01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:51.413
Maybe Bri did pay that
MAGA wearing ass nigga

1723
01:01:51.413 --> 01:01:52.920
come rough up the house.

1724
01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:55.040
- Keesha. that's what I'm saying.

1725
01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:57.040
- But who's money do you think she used?

1726
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.983
- What?

1727
01:01:59.856 --> 01:02:01.060
- You know that your loan
that your brother had got?

1728
01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:03.360
- Yeah.
- Well that wasn't no loan.

1729
01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:05.214
- What you talking about?

1730
01:02:05.214 --> 01:02:06.133
- Well. you know those scratch tickets

1731
01:02:06.133 --> 01:02:08.085
that he was getting at the gas station?

1732
01:02:08.085 --> 01:02:11.396
Well around Thanksgiving. one of them hit.

1733
01:02:11.396 --> 01:02:12.582
- Big ticket.

1734
01:02:12.582 --> 01:02:14.360
- And why the hell she knew all this?

1735
01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:15.687
- Well maybe if you listen. J.

1736
01:02:15.687 --> 01:02:18.593
you'll hear everything
that you need to know.

1737
01:02:19.765 --> 01:02:21.420
(horn honking)

1738
01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:22.440
You call the cops?

1739
01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:23.770
- Keesha. you know I aint call no police.

1740
01:02:23.770 --> 01:02:25.140
I handle my own business.

1741
01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:27.368
- Bri. go outside and see what's up.

1742
01:02:27.368 --> 01:02:29.120
I want to make sure that don't nobody

1743
01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:30.177
interrupt me and my man.

1744
01:02:30.177 --> 01:02:31.860
- Aight. Keesha. I got you.

1745
01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:33.556
- Yeah you know what. as a matter of fact.

1746
01:02:33.556 --> 01:02:35.596
stay out there and keep watch.

1747
01:02:35.596 --> 01:02:38.460
I'll let you know
whenever we done in here.

1748
01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:42.783
- Jerome. don't let a good
thing go to waste. now.

1749
01:02:44.529 --> 01:02:45.952
- Like I said. J.

1750
01:02:45.952 --> 01:02:49.420
Michael wasn't no husband.
not no real one anyway.

1751
01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:52.200
But we have been doing
this for what. three.

1752
01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:53.331
four months now?

1753
01:02:53.331 --> 01:02:54.342
- No!

1754
01:02:54.342 --> 01:02:55.880
- Oh I'll say about five.

1755
01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:57.420
I'll count the time me
and you did in the car

1756
01:02:57.420 --> 01:02:58.253
at his birthday party.

1757
01:02:58.253 --> 01:03:00.210
- No. shut up shut up shut up.

1758
01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:04.230
- But now I have this money.
this power. this freedom.

1759
01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:06.050
I told Michael not to tell nobody.

1760
01:03:06.050 --> 01:03:07.410
Figured he'd tell you. though.

1761
01:03:07.410 --> 01:03:10.490
- He said it was a
small loan. a few grand.

1762
01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:11.353
- Really?

1763
01:03:11.353 --> 01:03:12.260
- What?

1764
01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:14.810
- It was a lot more than a few grand.

1765
01:03:14.810 --> 01:03:16.133
- How much was it. Keesha?

1766
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:18.103
Keesha.

1767
01:03:18.103 --> 01:03:19.633
- Enough for a new life.

1768
01:03:19.633 --> 01:03:21.382
That's when I decided to make one.

1769
01:03:21.382 --> 01:03:22.880
- So what are you saying?

1770
01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:24.260
- Michael needed to disappear.

1771
01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:26.680
Everybody knew that he was
dealing with them shady people.

1772
01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:27.944
It was easy.

1773
01:03:27.944 --> 01:03:29.460
- Don't you tell me.

1774
01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:30.940
- All those ropes and chains that Michael

1775
01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:32.060
had in his shed?

1776
01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:33.760
Well they in my basement now.

1777
01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:34.940
See. when I was a little girl.

1778
01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:37.465
I went to camp and I learned
how to tie a lot of knots.

1779
01:03:37.465 --> 01:03:39.080
- No. no. no. no.

1780
01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:40.310
- Don't worry. J.

1781
01:03:40.310 --> 01:03:41.730
I fed him good for two months.

1782
01:03:41.730 --> 01:03:44.330
I let him watch TV and
everything to keep him calm.

1783
01:03:44.330 --> 01:03:46.210
I aint that bad of a person. am I?

1784
01:03:46.210 --> 01:03:47.043
- And then you killed him?

1785
01:03:47.043 --> 01:03:47.930
- Killed him?

1786
01:03:47.930 --> 01:03:49.412
I don't like using words like that.

1787
01:03:49.412 --> 01:03:52.060
He had been dying on his
own since I knew him.

1788
01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:53.410
I just put him to sleep.

1789
01:03:53.410 --> 01:03:54.870
Shot him up with some of that good stuff

1790
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:56.090
that you get off Prospect

1791
01:03:56.090 --> 01:03:57.390
and then me and Bri drug his body

1792
01:03:57.390 --> 01:03:58.550
out into the street one night.

1793
01:03:58.550 --> 01:04:01.140
you know. then we paid that
Eugene to come rough up

1794
01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:03.040
the house a little bit. you know.

1795
01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.346
to act like he owe somebody a
little bit of money and stuff.

1796
01:04:05.346 --> 01:04:08.601
Like I said. it was easy.

1797
01:04:08.601 --> 01:04:09.434
- You little--

1798
01:04:09.434 --> 01:04:10.867
- Aretha. help!

1799
01:04:10.867 --> 01:04:13.630
See in about 30 seconds your
mothers gonna come down here

1800
01:04:13.630 --> 01:04:15.240
and it's up to what she sees.

1801
01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.669
Did a spider scare me or
did her last living son

1802
01:04:17.669 --> 01:04:19.620
put his fist through my face?

1803
01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:20.850
- She aint gonna believe none of that.

1804
01:04:20.850 --> 01:04:22.186
- Why don't you try to find out?

1805
01:04:22.186 --> 01:04:24.881
See your mother and me. we're friends now.

1806
01:04:24.881 --> 01:04:27.662
See. I'm a player. J. I
knew how to play the game.

1807
01:04:27.662 --> 01:04:28.893
That's why you wanted me

1808
01:04:28.893 --> 01:04:31.082
and that's why you still want me.

1809
01:04:31.082 --> 01:04:33.630
(tense music)

1810
01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:34.860
So what they gonna believe?

1811
01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:36.990
That poor widow Keesha
had her husband chained up

1812
01:04:36.990 --> 01:04:38.290
in the basement for two months

1813
01:04:38.290 --> 01:04:41.850
or that you just had him killed
just so you can get some?

1814
01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:43.593
- Oh.

1815
01:04:45.477 --> 01:04:47.280
- I know what I believe.

1816
01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.330
- Mama.

1817
01:04:48.330 --> 01:04:50.630
- I heard it all son. I heard it all.

1818
01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:51.463
Come here.

1819
01:04:51.463 --> 01:04:52.886
- Oh mama. I'm so sorry.

1820
01:04:52.886 --> 01:04:54.056
I never meant to.

1821
01:04:54.056 --> 01:04:57.540
- I knew she was playing the
second that redhead heifer

1822
01:04:57.540 --> 01:04:58.943
came up in here tonight.

1823
01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:01.700
- You saved me. mama.

1824
01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:04.715
- I told you she wasn't no
good. Jerome. I told you.

1825
01:05:04.715 --> 01:05:05.548
(tense action music)

1826
01:05:05.548 --> 01:05:06.873
- Wait. what about Brianna?

1827
01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:09.863
- You rang?

1828
01:05:09.863 --> 01:05:10.840
- [Jerome] Kevin.

1829
01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:12.810
- Yo. Bri Bri was out here
looking like she was up

1830
01:05:12.810 --> 01:05:15.120
to some business and I
asked her what she was doing

1831
01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:16.940
out here. she reached
for the pepper spray.

1832
01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:18.710
so I smacked her up real quick.

1833
01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:20.820
She's out in the parking
lot right now. bro.

1834
01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:21.712
- Ha. my man.

1835
01:05:21.712 --> 01:05:23.295
- Yeah. yeah. yeah.

1836
01:05:24.716 --> 01:05:27.153
What the hell happened here?

1837
01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:30.305
Sorry. Ms. Washington.

1838
01:05:30.305 --> 01:05:32.307
- Yo. she killed Michael.

1839
01:05:32.307 --> 01:05:35.350
Yo. Michael hit it big in
a lottery. nobody knew.

1840
01:05:35.350 --> 01:05:36.470
She kept him in the basement for months

1841
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:37.303
and killed him for the money.

1842
01:05:37.303 --> 01:05:38.930
Wanted to start new with me.

1843
01:05:38.930 --> 01:05:39.763
- Crazy ho.

1844
01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.366
- What is going on down here?

1845
01:05:43.366 --> 01:05:45.130
- [Both] Pastor Rodney.

1846
01:05:45.130 --> 01:05:46.650
- Yeah. hey dude.

1847
01:05:46.650 --> 01:05:47.890
Hey. how doing?

1848
01:05:47.890 --> 01:05:49.240
- It's fine now.

1849
01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:51.560
- Pastor. you was in this
house this whole time?

1850
01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:53.300
- He's a heavy sleeper. Jerome.

1851
01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:54.160
- Mama.

1852
01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:55.420
- Mrs. W.

1853
01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:57.752
- [Aretha] You two better
fix your tongues. you hear?

1854
01:05:57.752 --> 01:05:58.752
- What's up?

1855
01:06:00.082 --> 01:06:00.915
- Oh hell no.

1856
01:06:00.915 --> 01:06:01.989
- Its cool. he's with me.

1857
01:06:01.989 --> 01:06:04.141
We talked more after you left the Y.

1858
01:06:04.141 --> 01:06:06.490
he's been doing security
detail with me tonight

1859
01:06:06.490 --> 01:06:08.530
just because of all the
trouble he's caused.

1860
01:06:08.530 --> 01:06:10.210
Matter of fact. he's the
one who noticed Brianna

1861
01:06:10.210 --> 01:06:12.200
reach for her pepper spray.

1862
01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:15.176
- Yeah. I just want a second chance. man.

1863
01:06:15.176 --> 01:06:17.403
Can we make America great together?

1864
01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:22.750
Look man. you know. like
allergies last time I was out here

1865
01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:24.280
dropped something. my medicine?

1866
01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:26.090
I'm just gonna go look for my medicine.

1867
01:06:26.090 --> 01:06:27.587
Y'all got bodies down here?

1868
01:06:27.587 --> 01:06:31.490
Hey man I watched that
movie on the cable channel.

1869
01:06:31.490 --> 01:06:34.067
don't. I'm touching nothing
but my medicine man.

1870
01:06:37.604 --> 01:06:40.499
- Come on. y'all we got
to pray on that one.

1871
01:06:40.499 --> 01:06:41.450
- Yeah we can use a prayer.

1872
01:06:41.450 --> 01:06:42.797
We can definitely use a prayer.

1873
01:06:42.797 --> 01:06:43.798
- [Aretha] Hallelujah.

1874
01:06:43.798 --> 01:06:44.937
- Father in the name of Jesus. lord.

1875
01:06:44.937 --> 01:06:48.222

us from the evil. lord.

(overlapping prayer)

1893
