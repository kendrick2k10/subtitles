3
00:33:58.038 --> 00:33:59.998
Each of these channels are measuring

4
00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:03.085
the brain waves in that specific part

5
00:34:03.126 --> 00:34:05.128
where they are stationed. correct?

6
01:03:41.947 --> 01:03:44.908
If you make meditation

7
01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:46.827
yourself

8
01:03:46.869 --> 01:03:48.787
your own sound.

9
01:03:48.829 --> 01:03:51.915
Silent sound. That's mind-power working.

10
01:03:51.957 --> 01:03:54.001
it's different

11
01:03:54.042 --> 01:03:56.795
Why do we make meditation?

12
01:03:56.837 --> 01:03:58.881
We make meditation because we want

13
01:03:58.922 --> 01:04:00.966
to make mind strong.

14
01:04:01.008 --> 01:04:02.885
We have this mind

15
01:04:02.926 --> 01:04:03.886
you know.

16
01:04:03.927 --> 01:04:05.929
Then. when we make meditation

17
01:04:05.971 --> 01:04:07.890
we make the mind strong. and then

18
01:04:07.931 --> 01:04:09.892
how we make the mind strong is

19
01:04:09.933 --> 01:04:11.810
we have to train.

20
01:04:11.852 --> 01:04:12.936
Train yourself.

21
01:04:29.953 --> 01:04:31.997
How are you going to train yourself?

22
01:04:33.957 --> 01:04:36.835
When you say. you have to say some word.

23
01:04:38.003 --> 01:04:39.963
Any word you would like to say.

24
01:04:40.005 --> 01:04:42.883
And then you have to choose the loaction.

25
01:04:42.925 --> 01:04:45.886
the focus location.

26
01:04:45.928 --> 01:04:47.846
We have the three places.

27
01:04:47.888 --> 01:04:49.806
One is forehead.

28
01:04:49.848 --> 01:04:51.934
Another one is heart.

29
01:04:51.975 --> 01:04:53.018
Right?t location.

30
01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:55.020
Another one is stomach.

31
01:04:55.062 --> 01:04:57.064
Why do we have to use this?

32
01:04:57.105 --> 01:05:02.027
You need to have a place to keep all the power.

33
01:05:02.069 --> 01:05:06.073
But the mind-power working is meditation.

34
01:05:06.949 --> 01:05:08.951
Not the sound.

35
01:05:08.992 --> 01:05:10.953
Different.

36
01:08:58.263 --> 01:09:00.182
So. it's safe to say mindfullness is

37
01:09:00.224 --> 01:09:03.227
another word for. like. presence?

38
01:09:04.185 --> 01:09:05.312
And awareness?

39
01:09:32.339 --> 01:09:34.258
Eckhart Tolle?

40
01:09:42.307 --> 01:09:44.268
You can test yourself.

41
01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:45.560
If you're angry

42
01:09:45.602 --> 01:09:47.187
very angry

43
01:09:47.229 --> 01:09:49.356
that just means your mind is very weak.

44
01:09:49.398 --> 01:09:51.358
You need to train your mind.

45
01:09:52.359 --> 01:09:54.361
If you're not angry at anybody

46
01:09:54.403 --> 01:09:56.321
you feel good.

47
01:09:56.363 --> 01:10:00.158
You think all positive; that everything is fine.

48
01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:02.369
The meditation change the mind from the people.

49
01:10:04.246 --> 01:10:06.373
Changing the mind to go a good way.
