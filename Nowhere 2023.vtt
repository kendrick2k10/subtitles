00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:17.458
It has been seven months since Spain
began implementing European measures

4
00:00:17.541 --> 00:00:19.916
of dealing with
the scarcity of basic resources.

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.625
The "Not Enough for All" plan
has begun to take effect.

6
00:00:23.708 --> 00:00:26.708
but for now. Spain.
as well as its neighbors.

7
00:00:26.791 --> 00:00:29.208
will be unable to sustain
dependent citizens

8
00:00:29.291 --> 00:00:31.583
without balancing out the resources.

9
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:32.541
We--

10
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.041
-This way.
-See you at the trucks. Careful. okay?

11
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:45.083
-You! This way.
-Come on. quickly. Quiet!

12
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.000
-Come on. Move it. Go!
-Go. Run.

13
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.166
-Move it!
-Let's go. sweetheart.

14
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.083
Come on.

15
00:00:55.291 --> 00:00:56.666
-Come on. hurry.
-What?

16
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.000
Move it!

17
00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:05.666
Move!

18
00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:08.750
This way. come on. Quick.

19
00:01:09.708 --> 00:01:10.541
Let's go.

20
00:01:13.041 --> 00:01:14.166
-This way.
-Come on.

21
00:01:16.125 --> 00:01:17.000
This way.

22
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.333
Come on!

23
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.958
Mia. come on. No time to hang around.

24
00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:23.375
Come on.

25
00:01:26.708 --> 00:01:27.625
-You okay?
-No.

26
00:01:28.208 --> 00:01:29.208
Move. dammit!

27
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.291
Go that way. You first.

28
00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:36.500
-Come on.
-Okay.

29
00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:38.541
Don't worry.

30
00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:49.958
-Nico!
-Here. I'm here.

31
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.916
-I won't fit.
-Yes. you will. You will.

32
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.291
-Push me.
-Come on.

33
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.375
-Are you okay?
-What?

34
00:02:00.458 --> 00:02:02.125
-Are you okay?
-Hide!

35
00:02:08.708 --> 00:02:09.541
Follow me.

36
00:02:12.125 --> 00:02:13.208
Come on.

37
00:02:16.208 --> 00:02:17.041
Come on.

38
00:02:17.541 --> 00:02:18.583
Come on. sweetheart.

39
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.833
Stay still.

40
00:02:23.791 --> 00:02:24.625
Come on.

41
00:02:28.208 --> 00:02:29.208
This way. Let's go.

42
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.875
Attention! This is the police…

43
00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.875
-Stop right there. You're under arrest…
-Come on.

44
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.583
Let's go.

45
00:02:39.083 --> 00:02:39.916
Wait here.

46
00:02:40.416 --> 00:02:41.458
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

47
00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:48.208
You. here.

48
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.083
Don't worry.

49
00:02:52.041 --> 00:02:52.916
What's wrong?

50
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.625
The conditions have changed.
More risk. more money.

51
00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:57.750
No. We don't have any more money.

52
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.208
That's not how it works.

53
00:03:04.666 --> 00:03:06.583
Sweetheart. give me your ring.

54
00:03:06.666 --> 00:03:07.625
-No.
-Yes.

55
00:03:07.708 --> 00:03:08.625
-No.
-Listen to me.

56
00:03:08.708 --> 00:03:10.833
Not the ring. We've given them everything.

57
00:03:10.916 --> 00:03:13.166
-We need to leave the country now.
-Here.

58
00:03:13.916 --> 00:03:14.750
Come on.

59
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.333
Come on. We don't have all night.

60
00:03:18.208 --> 00:03:19.041
Follow me.

61
00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:20.541
Enjoy your trip.

62
00:03:24.625 --> 00:03:25.750
We're almost there.

63
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.708
There it is. Our cruise ship.

64
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.125
Move. dammit!

65
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.333
Come on.

66
00:03:44.708 --> 00:03:45.791
-Are you okay?
-No.

67
00:03:57.166 --> 00:04:00.125
We supported the fight against shortages.

68
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.833
We supported sacrifices
for the common good.

69
00:04:03.916 --> 00:04:07.500
We accepted it when they told us
the measures would be temporary.

70
00:04:07.583 --> 00:04:09.833
Now what? Look where they've driven us.

71
00:04:10.666 --> 00:04:14.000
First. they got rid of the elderly
in order to fight the shortages.

72
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.541
Now. they're going after the children
and pregnant women. Don't you see?

73
00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:21.708
Children and pregnant women! This regime…

74
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:22.708
Nothing else on?

75
00:04:29.041 --> 00:04:30.541
-Take it off.
-Okay.

76
00:04:34.916 --> 00:04:36.625
Let's see. Wow…

77
00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:41.375
-It's okay.
-Okay?

78
00:04:41.458 --> 00:04:42.416
-Yeah.
-Here.

79
00:04:51.083 --> 00:04:52.541
Your baby had better shut up.

80
00:05:05.291 --> 00:05:06.541
Where did you get this?

81
00:05:07.458 --> 00:05:08.291
Tell me.

82
00:05:08.833 --> 00:05:09.708
It's a secret.

83
00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:12.166
Don't eat it now.

84
00:05:12.666 --> 00:05:14.875
We have to save it for when we get there.

85
00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.541
-To celebrate. right?
-Yeah.

86
00:05:22.166 --> 00:05:24.125
Do you think the regime will get there?

87
00:05:25.208 --> 00:05:27.291
Ireland has always opposed it.

88
00:05:27.833 --> 00:05:29.833
Whatever.
All governments are falling for it.

89
00:05:30.333 --> 00:05:32.750
-You know something about the Irish?
-What?

90
00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:36.666
You can't defeat them. They drink stout.

91
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.458
-Right.
-Ireland won't give in.

92
00:05:41.041 --> 00:05:42.791
It's okay to be scared. you know?

93
00:05:44.208 --> 00:05:45.708
It'll be fine. You'll see.

94
00:05:47.625 --> 00:05:49.625
-You don't know that.
-The worst is over.

95
00:05:49.708 --> 00:05:51.083
You don't know that either.

96
00:05:52.625 --> 00:05:54.083
I know something for a fact.

97
00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:55.958
What?

98
00:05:56.708 --> 00:05:58.666
I love you more now than yesterday…

99
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.333
…but less than tomorrow.

100
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.291
What is it? Have we arrived?

101
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.875
We're leaving.

102
00:06:36.166 --> 00:06:37.458
No more games.

103
00:06:45.458 --> 00:06:48.333
Do you think she's pregnant
and traveling alone?

104
00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.875
If she's pregnant. she's not alone.

105
00:07:03.916 --> 00:07:05.541
How's our little Noa doing?

106
00:07:07.041 --> 00:07:08.208
You named her already?

107
00:07:08.291 --> 00:07:09.250
Noa.

108
00:07:10.583 --> 00:07:13.375
-What name would you like?
-I hope it's not a girl.

109
00:07:13.916 --> 00:07:14.750
I mean it.

110
00:07:15.666 --> 00:07:18.125
It's not a girl. It's a warrior.

111
00:07:19.125 --> 00:07:20.416
She kicks. just like you do.

112
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.583
I can't feel her.

113
00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:23.791
What?

114
00:07:24.541 --> 00:07:26.541
It's been two days since I have…

115
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:30.208
felt her move.

116
00:07:32.166 --> 00:07:34.708
-Why didn't you tell me?
-I don't know.

117
00:07:40.458 --> 00:07:41.416
What are you doing?

118
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:45.833
Haven't you noticed she always kicks here?

119
00:07:47.375 --> 00:07:48.750
I think this is a foot.

120
00:07:50.041 --> 00:07:51.166
How do you do it?

121
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:53.583
Do what?

122
00:07:57.166 --> 00:07:58.958
I don't know. you seem fine. as if…

123
00:08:00.375 --> 00:08:01.791
as if nothing's happened.

124
00:08:02.375 --> 00:08:03.833
You know that's not true.

125
00:08:06.875 --> 00:08:07.958
You know that. right?

126
00:08:14.625 --> 00:08:16.125
You brought my ducky!

127
00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:18.583
What's ducky saying?

128
00:08:28.791 --> 00:08:30.000
-Nico.
-What?

129
00:08:33.833 --> 00:08:37.250
What if she's alive.
and we're leaving her behind?

130
00:08:39.541 --> 00:08:40.375
Alone…

131
00:08:42.458 --> 00:08:43.291
She's gone.

132
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:45.875
They took her away.

133
00:08:46.875 --> 00:08:47.708
She's dead.

134
00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.083
Open the doors!

135
00:09:26.625 --> 00:09:27.458
Hey!

136
00:09:28.208 --> 00:09:29.708
Nico!

137
00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:31.166
-Mia!
-Please!

138
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.708
Quickly!

139
00:09:32.791 --> 00:09:34.208
-Get up here!
-Come on!

140
00:09:36.125 --> 00:09:37.791
-Stop!
-Nico.

141
00:09:37.875 --> 00:09:39.375
-Mia!
-Stop!

142
00:09:41.125 --> 00:09:43.208
Relax. There are lots of people.

143
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.250
A truck's coming now.

144
00:09:45.333 --> 00:09:47.416
Half of you. get out. okay?

145
00:09:50.791 --> 00:09:52.041
Mia!

146
00:09:52.125 --> 00:09:53.541
Mia!

147
00:09:54.416 --> 00:09:56.166
-Nico!
-Mia!

148
00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:57.708
Come on!

149
00:09:57.791 --> 00:09:58.750
I want you out!

150
00:09:58.833 --> 00:10:00.375
You. Are you deaf?

151
00:10:00.458 --> 00:10:01.416
Come on. get down.

152
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.666
No.

153
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:05.375
-I was inside with my wife. Inside.
-Get out!

154
00:10:06.875 --> 00:10:07.750
Nico!

155
00:10:07.833 --> 00:10:08.791
Come on. out!

156
00:10:08.875 --> 00:10:10.125
No!

157
00:10:10.208 --> 00:10:11.666
No!

158
00:10:14.833 --> 00:10:16.041
You! Go to that truck.

159
00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:23.791
Nico…

160
00:10:24.375 --> 00:10:25.250
No…

161
00:10:32.375 --> 00:10:33.208
Let's go!

162
00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.583
Nico.

163
00:10:39.916 --> 00:10:40.750
Nico!

164
00:10:41.291 --> 00:10:42.750
Nico!

165
00:10:42.833 --> 00:10:43.666
Nico!

166
00:10:44.208 --> 00:10:45.333
107. Green.

167
00:10:45.416 --> 00:10:47.250
No! Wait!

168
00:10:54.208 --> 00:10:55.333
-Mia!
-Are you okay?

169
00:10:55.416 --> 00:10:57.333
Yes. I'm fine.

170
00:10:57.416 --> 00:10:58.833
-Okay. Nico…
-Yes?

171
00:10:59.458 --> 00:11:02.916
-How will we find each other?
-Relax. I'm in the truck behind.

172
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.708
I don't wanna be alone.
I really don't wanna be alone.

173
00:11:05.791 --> 00:11:09.791
No. Listen to me.
Don't trust anyone. Okay?

174
00:11:09.875 --> 00:11:13.583
Keep your things safe. Your phone.
the food… Be careful. sweetheart.

175
00:11:14.083 --> 00:11:15.041
Did you hear me?

176
00:11:15.791 --> 00:11:18.541
Are you there? Mia! Please answer me.

177
00:11:18.625 --> 00:11:21.458
Listen. are you sure
they're taking us to the same place?

178
00:11:21.541 --> 00:11:23.791
Yes. As soon as they stop. I'll escape.

179
00:11:23.875 --> 00:11:26.000
There's only one boat this week.
and it's ours.

180
00:11:26.083 --> 00:11:27.208
-Nico…
-Yes?

181
00:11:28.333 --> 00:11:29.875
I want to be with you.

182
00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:33.375
Me too. sweetheart.
Everything will be okay. Don't worry.

183
00:11:33.458 --> 00:11:37.041
It'll be okay. We'll talk later.
I'll call you later. okay?

184
00:11:37.125 --> 00:11:38.416
Don't hang up on me.

185
00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.208
Sweetheart… We have to save
all the battery we can.

186
00:11:41.291 --> 00:11:44.375
-Don't hang up on me.
-We'll be together soon. You'll see.

187
00:11:44.916 --> 00:11:46.583
-Nico…
-Yes?

188
00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:49.916
-What is it. honey?
-Don't be long.

189
00:11:50.583 --> 00:11:52.625
-I won't. I promise.
-Okay.

190
00:12:26.791 --> 00:12:27.625
Quiet!

191
00:12:33.125 --> 00:12:34.875
Murderers!

192
00:12:36.625 --> 00:12:38.208
Murderers!

193
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.500
GIVE US OUR CHILDREN BACK

194
00:12:46.583 --> 00:12:47.625
No…

195
00:12:59.375 --> 00:13:01.541
MURDERERS!
THIS IS NOT THE WAY

196
00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:00.083
What?

197
00:14:06.541 --> 00:14:08.500
-What is it?
-We have to go to the back.

198
00:14:09.791 --> 00:14:10.625
Be quiet.

199
00:14:31.666 --> 00:14:32.500
Hello there.

200
00:14:33.208 --> 00:14:34.041
Hello.

201
00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:38.416
-Get out of the truck. Bring your papers.
-Is that necessary? I'm late.

202
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.750
-What are you carrying?
-It's all in the papers.

203
00:14:40.833 --> 00:14:41.958
Alright.

204
00:14:42.041 --> 00:14:44.333
-Can you come to the back?
-Yeah.

205
00:14:54.166 --> 00:14:56.166
-That's all you're carrying?
-Yeah.

206
00:14:57.791 --> 00:14:59.083
You don't know what it is?

207
00:15:00.208 --> 00:15:01.833
Not really. It's in the papers.

208
00:15:02.416 --> 00:15:06.458
I know what's in there. but you don't.
You don't know what you're carrying.

209
00:15:08.083 --> 00:15:09.666
I do a lot of runs…

210
00:15:10.208 --> 00:15:11.041
Stop!

211
00:15:11.916 --> 00:15:13.166
Is there a problem?

212
00:15:20.541 --> 00:15:21.750
Here's another truck.

213
00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:23.916
Keep going.

214
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:24.833
Go ahead.

215
00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.125
Get him to pull over.

216
00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:35.583
Can I go?

217
00:15:36.208 --> 00:15:37.208
Are you in a hurry?

218
00:15:39.041 --> 00:15:41.208
If I'm late. I get penalized.

219
00:15:42.041 --> 00:15:43.916
Yeah. but I have to look inside.

220
00:15:44.791 --> 00:15:47.916
Is it necessary? I hardly have anything.

221
00:15:48.416 --> 00:15:50.500
Don't worry. I'll write your boss a note.

222
00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:52.666
Travis. stand over there.

223
00:17:20.333 --> 00:17:21.916
Now!

224
00:17:35.291 --> 00:17:38.041
Okay.

225
00:17:40.708 --> 00:17:41.541
Come on out.

226
00:17:42.583 --> 00:17:44.750
Don't be afraid. We're not gonna hurt you.

227
00:17:46.416 --> 00:17:47.541
Don't you want out?

228
00:17:57.583 --> 00:18:01.291
I know the measures against shortages
have been brutal

229
00:18:01.375 --> 00:18:03.458
towards children and pregnant women.

230
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:06.625
I know it's hard to trust someone
on this side of the wall.

231
00:18:07.666 --> 00:18:09.541
But who have you trusted until now?

232
00:18:11.333 --> 00:18:14.333
The people who stuffed you in here.

233
00:18:14.416 --> 00:18:17.708
condemned you to suffocation.
and took all the money you had left?

234
00:18:17.791 --> 00:18:21.333
Those who promised you a better place?

235
00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:25.458
That better place does not exist.

236
00:18:25.958 --> 00:18:27.916
Come out. and you won't regret it.

237
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.208
Otherwise. I have orders to shoot.

238
00:18:31.416 --> 00:18:34.833
Don't make me give that order. dammit.
I've done it too many times.

239
00:18:40.791 --> 00:18:41.666
Oh well. I tried.

240
00:19:00.833 --> 00:19:02.375
Give me your hand.

241
00:19:03.916 --> 00:19:04.750
Hey!

242
00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:09.250
Give me your hand!

243
00:19:10.166 --> 00:19:11.333
Kill them all.

244
00:19:42.791 --> 00:19:43.625
Doggy!

245
00:19:58.125 --> 00:20:00.833
Clean up all this shit
and gather their things.

246
00:20:21.166 --> 00:20:22.333
All done. boss.

247
00:20:22.416 --> 00:20:23.250
Good.

248
00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:51.458

249
00:20:52.125 --> 00:20:53.250
Nico. hide.

250
00:20:54.083 --> 00:20:55.833
Hide. They killed them all.

251
00:20:57.291 --> 00:21:00.791
Hide. They killed them all. Hide.

252
00:21:57.916 --> 00:22:00.625
Hi. it's Nico.

00:22:13.625 --> 00:22:16.166
I'm at the port. Where are you?

255
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:19.833
Where are you? Why won't you pick up?

256
00:22:21.208 --> 00:22:22.041
Pick up.

257
00:23:52.666 --> 00:23:54.125
This way. run!

258
00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.083

What's happening?

326
00:35:56.916 --> 00:35:58.333
No!

327
00:36:42.291 --> 00:36:43.125

Hello?

337
00:38:27.625 --> 00:38:28.750

What?

339
00:39:09.125 --> 00:39:10.625
UNKNOWN NUMBER

340
00:39:12.208 --> 00:39:13.208
Mia. sweetheart.

341
00:39:13.291 --> 00:39:14.291
-Nico?
-Yes!

342
00:39:14.375 --> 00:39:15.208
Finally!

343
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.041
-Thank goodness!
-I didn't know if you were still alive.

344
00:39:19.125 --> 00:39:20.250
-Yes.
-Are you okay?

345
00:39:20.333 --> 00:39:22.500
-I couldn't call. The battery died.
-Okay.

346
00:39:22.583 --> 00:39:25.916
The driver screwed us.
He abandoned us outside the city.

347
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.750
-It'll take a while for me to catch up.
-Listen to me.

348
00:39:28.833 --> 00:39:32.208
-What is it?
-I'm trapped. I can't get out.

349
00:39:32.291 --> 00:39:35.500
-I'm coming to get you.
-No. wait. Nico. Listen to me.

350
00:39:35.583 --> 00:39:37.750
-I'm not…
-What is it?

351
00:39:38.625 --> 00:39:41.041
-I'm not on the ship.
-What do you mean?

352
00:39:41.125 --> 00:39:43.500
I'm not on the ship.
My container fell off.

353
00:39:44.958 --> 00:39:46.916
-Where are you?
-Floating in the sea.

354
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.250
I'm floating. I don't know… I'm okay.

355
00:39:49.333 --> 00:39:52.708
But I don't know how long before
the water rises and the container sinks.

356
00:39:52.791 --> 00:39:54.750
Motherfucker! Can you see outside?

357
00:39:54.833 --> 00:39:57.166
Yes. I can see outside.
and all I see is water.

358
00:39:57.250 --> 00:40:00.333
-Nothing else?
-Nothing. I'm in the middle of the sea.

359
00:40:02.791 --> 00:40:04.458
Say something. anything.

360
00:40:04.541 --> 00:40:07.791
Don't worry. my love.
I promise I'm coming for you.

361
00:40:07.875 --> 00:40:10.333
-You have to hang in there. sweetheart.
-Nico…

362
00:40:10.416 --> 00:40:12.625
-Hang in there.
-I can't do it.

363
00:40:12.708 --> 00:40:15.083
-Do it for the baby.
-I don't think I can.

364
00:40:15.166 --> 00:40:17.416
-Yes. you can.
-I miss her so much. Nico.

365
00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.375
-No.
-I messed up again.

366
00:40:20.458 --> 00:40:24.083
Not that. Not now. It wasn't your fault.

367
00:40:24.583 --> 00:40:27.291
Do you hear me?
What happened to Uma wasn't your fault.

368

Okay.

369
00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:32.250
You're the strongest person I've ever met.
Don't give up. Promise me?

00:40:32.333 --> 00:40:33.875
-Yes.

Yes?

372

-I love you more than yesterday.
-But less than you will tomorrow.

373
00:40:39.833 --> 00:40:42.583
I'll call as soon as I have a plan.
Keep the phone safe.

It's okay.

483
00:57:05.083 --> 00:57:06.333
Hush.

484
00:57:07.083 --> 00:57:08.041
It's okay.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.000
Go away!

486
00:57:20.583 --> 00:57:21.791

I just wanted to play with the airplane.

505
01:01:15.625 --> 01:01:16.458

I'm sorry.

508
01:01:28.291 --> 01:01:29.250
It was my fault.

509
01:01:29.791 --> 01:01:30.625
I messed up.

510
01:01:34.083 --> 01:01:34.916
I'm sorry.

511
01:01:39.416 --> 01:01:40.875

This is the sea.

517
01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:16.250
The sun and the sea.

518
01:05:17.375 --> 01:05:18.208
And the sky.

519
01:05:19.666 --> 01:05:22.125
And way over there is where we're going.

01:05:40.375 --> 01:05:42.166
You feel better outside. right?

521
01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:46.416
Yes. you're much happier
because you're in the sun and fresh air.

528
01:09:08.166 --> 01:09:09.666
I can't.

529
01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:12.583
I can't.

530
01:09:37.416 --> 01:09:38.541

539
01:11:52.291 --> 01:11:55.125
Don't look at me like that.
You were desperate for a feed too.

540
01:12:07.166 --> 01:12:08.458
MAXIMUM

541
01:12:08.541 --> 01:12:13.041

01:12:48.625 --> 01:12:50.875
Such a good girl. Good girl.

543
01:12:54.166 --> 01:12:55.208
Hi. sweetheart.

544
01:13:17.541 --> 01:13:18.958
Where are you?

01:13:49.291 --> 01:13:50.583
DAY 12

548
01:14:09.708 --> 01:14:10.791
Look. that's me.

549
01:14:11.375 --> 01:14:12.208
At school.

550
01:14:13.291 --> 01:14:15.791
With the kids.
Did I tell you I was a teacher?

551
01:14:17.250 --> 01:14:18.333
This is your dad.

552
01:14:18.416 --> 01:14:19.500
His name's Nico.

553
01:14:19.583 --> 01:14:21.708
Here he is. in the store.
Look how happy he is.

554
01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:26.166
We had to close the store down
because supplies got so scarce.

555
01:14:27.041 --> 01:14:29.291
In the end. we had nothing to sell.

556
01:14:29.791 --> 01:14:31.625
But people still went in to see him.

557
01:14:32.583 --> 01:14:36.541
That's why I know
he'll find a way to get us out of here.

558
01:14:36.625 --> 01:14:37.458
Because…

559
01:14:38.541 --> 01:14:40.166
he always thinks of something.

560
01:14:45.041 --> 01:14:47.083
This is your grandma. Noa.

561
01:14:47.916 --> 01:14:50.083
What do you think of that name? Noa.

562
01:14:50.958 --> 01:14:52.125
I think it's nice.

563
01:14:52.666 --> 01:14:54.750
It means "long life." It's also…

564
01:14:56.041 --> 01:14:57.291
the feminine of Noah.

565
01:14:57.375 --> 01:14:59.833
Noah's ark. They got there.

566
01:15:00.791 --> 01:15:02.541
They were saved. They got to shore.

567
01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:07.250
It's an animal story.
I'll tell you all about it.

568
01:15:12.250 --> 01:15:13.125
This is Uma.

569
01:15:14.041 --> 01:15:16.041
You want to hear about her. right?

570
01:15:20.625 --> 01:15:23.500
You have the same eyes as her.

571
01:15:23.583 --> 01:15:24.625
Exactly the same.

572
01:15:25.416 --> 01:15:27.958
The same face when she was little.

573
01:15:28.041 --> 01:15:30.500
She wanted to be a pilot.
An airplane pilot.

574
01:15:31.208 --> 01:15:32.708
She'd say. "Airplane pilot."

575
01:15:33.208 --> 01:15:35.375
You two would have got on well.

576
01:15:39.041 --> 01:15:40.541
What happened was…

577
01:15:44.166 --> 01:15:47.875
When the regime took over.
she and I had to lock ourselves in.

578
01:15:47.958 --> 01:15:51.166
Dad would go out to get food.

579
01:15:51.250 --> 01:15:53.958
The thing is time went by. and…

580
01:15:57.250 --> 01:15:59.458
Uma wanted to go out because…

581
01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.875
A little girl
can't be locked up for that long.

582
01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:07.500
At home. there wasn't…

583
01:16:12.875 --> 01:16:14.791
There wasn't much space.

584
01:16:16.375 --> 01:16:17.333
So…

585
01:16:19.416 --> 01:16:22.000
She kept asking me. on and on.

586
01:16:24.375 --> 01:16:27.333
And one day we went out.

587
01:16:28.875 --> 01:16:31.583
It was only for five minutes.
but they took her away.

588
01:16:41.041 --> 01:16:42.125
It was my fault.

589
01:16:43.083 --> 01:16:43.916
I messed up.

590
01:16:46.833 --> 01:16:47.666
I messed up.

591
01:17:08.708 --> 01:17:10.000
What is it? Are you okay?

592
01:17:10.541 --> 01:17:11.583
You're frozen.

593
01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:27.333
Okay.

594
01:17:34.333 --> 01:17:36.125
You're so cute with my hat.

595
01:17:37.458 --> 01:17:38.500
It suits you.

596
01:17:41.833 --> 01:17:43.833
You'll be better tomorrow. okay?

597
01:17:44.625 --> 01:17:45.875
Wrapped up.

598
01:17:47.583 --> 01:17:48.583
All wrapped up.

599
01:17:54.583 --> 01:17:57.208
Did anyone ever tell you

600
01:17:59.833 --> 01:18:02.625
That no dream

601
01:18:05.041 --> 01:18:08.291
Has time or space?

602
01:18:10.208 --> 01:18:14.250
No possessor

603
01:18:16.541 --> 01:18:18.250
No one

604
01:18:21.125 --> 01:18:22.708
No one

605
01:20:06.166 --> 01:20:07.000
It's okay.

606
01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:15.625
DAY 12

607
01:20:17.375 --> 01:20:18.208
No…

608
01:20:19.250 --> 01:20:21.041
MAXIMUM

609
01:21:05.166 --> 01:21:06.208
Nico!

610
01:21:07.458 --> 01:21:08.833
Come on. please.

611
01:21:08.916 --> 01:21:10.625
Please. please.

612
01:21:13.333 --> 01:21:15.583
-Nico!
-Mia!

613
01:21:16.083 --> 01:21:18.125
-Can you hear me?
-Yes. finally.

614
01:21:18.625 --> 01:21:22.208
Finally. sweetheart.
I couldn't call you. There was no signal.

615
01:21:22.291 --> 01:21:25.416
My phone is broken. The screen is broken…

616
01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:27.250
-Where are you?
-Listen to me.

617
01:21:27.333 --> 01:21:28.458
What's wrong. Nico?

618
01:21:29.791 --> 01:21:33.250
I can't come to rescue you.
You have to do it alone.

619
01:21:34.791 --> 01:21:37.791
Promise me you'll do it. Promise me.

620
01:21:38.958 --> 01:21:39.958
Nico. what is it?

621
01:21:41.166 --> 01:21:42.583
Please. don't scare me.

622
01:21:43.791 --> 01:21:45.083
Sweetheart. what is it?

623
01:21:45.875 --> 01:21:46.708
I'm…

624
01:21:48.833 --> 01:21:49.666
Nico…

625
01:21:50.208 --> 01:21:51.875
I'm hidden in a container.

626
01:21:52.916 --> 01:21:54.916
I got into a speedboat. but…

627
01:21:55.833 --> 01:21:56.916
they found me. and…

628
01:21:57.791 --> 01:21:59.791
I managed to get away. but they shot me.

629
01:22:01.458 --> 01:22:02.458
Are you hurt?

630
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:05.083
I'm losing a lot of blood.

631
01:22:05.833 --> 01:22:06.916
What?

632
01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:07.833
Sweetheart…

633
01:22:09.250 --> 01:22:10.083
What?

634
01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.666
I just wanted to say goodbye.

635
01:22:15.458 --> 01:22:16.791
I promise you I tried.

636
01:22:18.375 --> 01:22:20.541
I tried as hard as I could.

637
01:22:22.166 --> 01:22:24.333
I promise. I'm sorry.

638
01:22:25.208 --> 01:22:27.833
You were right. You always are. I was…

639
01:22:28.875 --> 01:22:29.958
too optimistic.

640
01:22:31.083 --> 01:22:32.708
It wasn't a good idea to go.

641
01:22:33.208 --> 01:22:34.666
-No.
-I'm sorry.

642
01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:36.958
-No. Nico. listen.
-I'm so sorry. sweetheart.

643
01:22:37.041 --> 01:22:38.375
Listen to me.

644
01:22:38.875 --> 01:22:40.000
You saved us both.

645
01:22:40.666 --> 01:22:42.333
-Do you hear me?
-What?

646
01:22:43.041 --> 01:22:44.333
You both?

647
01:22:44.416 --> 01:22:46.166
Yes. sweetheart. she's here.

648
01:22:48.666 --> 01:22:50.791
She was born. She's here with me.

649
01:22:53.166 --> 01:22:54.416
She's so beautiful.

650
01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.333
-She's beautiful?
-Yes.

651
01:22:56.416 --> 01:22:58.333
A little girl. right? I knew it.

652
01:22:59.541 --> 01:23:01.500
-Are you okay?
-Yes. we're fine.

653
01:23:02.041 --> 01:23:04.041
-We're fine.
-I wish I was there.

654
01:23:04.125 --> 01:23:07.333
You are here. Nico.
You're here. You were always here.

655
01:23:07.416 --> 01:23:08.916
You were at the birth.

656
01:23:09.916 --> 01:23:12.500
You were there
when I opened the container.

657
01:23:14.041 --> 01:23:17.916
Nico. I promised you I'd fight.
and I fought. I swear I fought.

658
01:23:18.958 --> 01:23:22.125
You're there when I sing to her.
You're always here with me.

659
01:23:22.208 --> 01:23:24.250
What? You sing?

660
01:23:25.083 --> 01:23:25.916
Yes.

661
01:23:28.958 --> 01:23:30.875
My love… What's she like?

662
01:23:32.958 --> 01:23:35.791
She's just like you. She's beautiful.

663
01:23:35.875 --> 01:23:40.291
Strong and funny and she makes me laugh.
She looks after me. Just like you.

664
01:23:40.791 --> 01:23:43.458
What am I saying? She's right here.

665
01:23:43.541 --> 01:23:46.291
I'm going to put the phone close
so she can hear you.

666
01:23:46.791 --> 01:23:47.875
-Okay.
-Sweetheart…

667
01:23:48.458 --> 01:23:52.041
The voice you're going to hear
is your dad's. Talk to him.

668
01:23:54.583 --> 01:23:57.666
Hello. Princess. It's Dad.

669
01:23:59.458 --> 01:24:04.208
That guy who used to squeeze your foot
when you were in Mom's tummy.

670
01:24:05.708 --> 01:24:07.541
Listen. my love…

671
01:24:09.083 --> 01:24:10.625
I have to tell you a secret.

672
01:24:12.541 --> 01:24:15.041
If things ever get complicated.

673
01:24:16.291 --> 01:24:17.250
close your eyes

674
01:24:18.250 --> 01:24:20.166
and snuggle up to your mom.

675
01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:24.250
You'll see it's the best place to be.

676
01:24:25.791 --> 01:24:26.625
Always.

677
01:24:31.708 --> 01:24:33.541
Did you hear her? She's so clever.

678
01:24:35.083 --> 01:24:36.208
Her name's Noa.

679
01:24:37.083 --> 01:24:37.916
Noa?

680
01:24:39.458 --> 01:24:40.291
Are you sure?

681
01:24:42.625 --> 01:24:44.375
She looks a lot like a Noa.

682
01:24:44.458 --> 01:24:47.375
I can't think of a better name.

683
01:24:50.125 --> 01:24:50.958
Nico…

684
01:24:51.791 --> 01:24:52.750
What?

685
01:24:53.541 --> 01:24:55.750
Nico. I love you more than yesterday.

686
01:24:57.125 --> 01:24:58.750
But less than tomorrow.

Noa!

697
01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:32.375

698
01:28:32.875 --> 01:28:34.500

700
01:29:06.125 --> 01:29:06.958

No fucking way.

I know we're almost there.

727
01:34:56.041 --> 01:34:58.000
We need to hold on a little longer.

728
01:34:58.500 --> 01:34:59.583
Just a little longer.

729
01:35:00.166 --> 01:35:02.000
We have to tell our story.

730
01:35:04.750 --> 01:35:06.666

Forgive me.
