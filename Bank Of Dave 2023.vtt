-Hello.
-Hello.

174
00:09:34.166 --> 00:09:38.208
Um. I need to see. uh. Mr Fishwick.

175
00:09:38.291 --> 00:09:41.083
-Yeah. he's just upstairs. that way.
-Okay. thank you.

176
00:09:42.458 --> 00:09:43.666
[sighs]

177
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.875
Hello. I'm Dave. How can I help you?

178
00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.916
Hi. Hugh Stockwell
from Bentham and Green Solicitors.

179
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.583
Ah. Hugh. you made it!

180
00:09:54.666 --> 00:09:57.291
Great. Take a load off.
How were your journey?

181
00:09:57.375 --> 00:09:59.958
-Yes. fine. fine. Shall we just get…
-[Dave] Great.

182
00:10:00.041 --> 00:10:01.583
…straight to it. shall we?

183
00:10:01.666 --> 00:10:03.333
-Sounds good to me.
-Yes.

184
00:10:03.416 --> 00:10:08.541
So… [clears throat] …I understand
that you would like… to open a bank.

185
00:10:08.625 --> 00:10:09.875
That's right. [taps desk]

186
00:10:10.375 --> 00:10:12.583
The Bank of Dave.

187
00:10:12.666 --> 00:10:15.833
That's… [laughs] That's…
It's catchy. Very catchy.

188
00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.541
So. tell me. how did this idea come about?

189
00:10:19.625 --> 00:10:23.250
-So. as you can see. I sell minibuses.
-Yes.

190
00:10:23.333 --> 00:10:24.750
[Dave] I used to sell vans.

191
00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:28.125
I've got seven of these dealerships
across Lancashire and Yorkshire.

192
00:10:28.208 --> 00:10:31.250
and. uh. well. I won't deny it.
I make good money.

193
00:10:31.333 --> 00:10:34.166
Now. a couple of year back.
the country were in recession.

194
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:36.833
and. uh. my customers
were havin' problems making payments.

195
00:10:36.916 --> 00:10:40.083
-So I started lending them me own money.
-Okay.

196
00:10:40.166 --> 00:10:42.375
Pretty soon.
I were making loans to families

197
00:10:42.458 --> 00:10:44.958
and small businesses in the local area.

198
00:10:45.041 --> 00:10:47.666
-Why didn't they go to the banks?
-They couldn't.

199
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:50.500
For all sorts of reasons.
the banks wouldn't touch 'em.

200
00:10:50.583 --> 00:10:51.458
Okay.

201
00:10:51.541 --> 00:10:54.416
-Don't get me started on those buggers.
-The banks?

202
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.125
They caused the recession.

203
00:10:56.625 --> 00:10:59.833
Speculating. treating the economy
like it were a bloody casino.

204
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.458
[sighs] Yeah.

205
00:11:01.541 --> 00:11:03.375
[Dave] Got greedier and greedier.

206
00:11:04.083 --> 00:11:06.333
Until the whole house of cards
came tumbling down.

207
00:11:06.416 --> 00:11:11.416
And then. the government bailed them out.
With billions of pounds of tax money.

208
00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.625
It came from the pockets
of the same people whose money they lost.

209
00:11:14.708 --> 00:11:17.875
Hmm. Not their finest hour.
that's for sure.

210
00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.666
-Bloody right.
-You were… Yeah.

211
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:21.291
-That's not the worst of it.
-No.

212
00:11:21.375 --> 00:11:26.166
Then. the top dogs decide to keep
paying themselves millions in bonuses.

213
00:11:26.833 --> 00:11:28.625
-For losing money.
-I know. but…

214
00:11:28.708 --> 00:11:30.000
-Bunch of tossers.
-But…

215
00:11:30.083 --> 00:11:31.500
-They should all be in jail.
-Hmm.

216
00:11:31.583 --> 00:11:33.333
Yeah. but. back to the loans…

217
00:11:33.416 --> 00:11:35.750
-You were making. you were saying….
-Right.

218
00:11:35.833 --> 00:11:40.125
-So. I lent out just over a million quid.
-A million pounds.

219
00:11:40.208 --> 00:11:43.750
Can you guess how many
of those loans went bad?

220
00:11:45.416 --> 00:11:47.583
Oh. I… [puffs] …seven?

221
00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:49.291
Try again. Hugh.

222
00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:51.541
-Three. I mean. I don't--
-Warmer.

223
00:11:51.625 --> 00:11:53.000
Not a single one.

224
00:11:53.583 --> 00:11:54.916
-Wow.
-Zip-a-de-doo-dah.

225
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.166
In fact. some of me customers
started making money.

226
00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:59.916
And they asked me to invest it for 'em.

227
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.791
For which you need accreditation.

228
00:12:01.875 --> 00:12:03.250
[laughs] Spot on. Hugh.

229
00:12:03.333 --> 00:12:04.708
-That's why you're here.
-Yes.

230
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:07.666
Uh. one last thing.
This isn't about me making money.

231
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:11.041
Every single penny of profit
goes straight to local charities.

232
00:12:12.041 --> 00:12:14.041
Oh. that's… That's. um…

233
00:12:15.166 --> 00:12:18.125
It's charitable. isn't it?
That's… Yeah. great.

234
00:12:19.625 --> 00:12:23.541
-You don't look very convinced. Hugh.
-No. it's-- I don't have any…

235
00:12:24.375 --> 00:12:27.875
You're not paying me to tell you what
you want to hear. you're paying me to…

236
00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:31.166
[inhales] …point out all the pitfalls
and stumbling blocks

237
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.000
and problems you are going to face.

238
00:12:33.083 --> 00:12:34.958
Ah. and hopefully
to find a way around 'em.

239
00:12:35.541 --> 00:12:36.375
Yeah.

240
00:12:37.791 --> 00:12:41.041
Right. so firstly I'm going to need to see
the paperwork of those loans

241
00:12:41.125 --> 00:12:42.875
and the financials of your businesses.

242
00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.833
Phyllis has got all that ready for you.

243
00:12:44.916 --> 00:12:47.541
Great. I'll talk to Phyllis
and get back to you.

244
00:12:48.041 --> 00:12:50.916
-Nine o'clock. here tomorrow morning?
-Tomorrow?

245
00:12:51.625 --> 00:12:52.791
Uh. yes. okay.

246
00:12:52.875 --> 00:12:54.666
-Yes.
-Great to meet you. Hugh.

247
00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.458
Great.

248
00:12:58.166 --> 00:12:59.500
Welcome to Burnley.

249
00:13:01.041 --> 00:13:02.583
[man] Thank you. your worship.

250
00:13:04.458 --> 00:13:05.291
[gavel slams]

251
00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:10.708
In order to relieve pressure
on both hospitals and GPs.

252
00:13:10.791 --> 00:13:15.291
we need to find a way to bridge the gap
between primary and tertiary care.

253
00:13:16.041 --> 00:13:20.708
This proposed facility does that
in the most efficient and economical way.

254
00:13:21.333 --> 00:13:22.583
Doctor Ashforth.

255
00:13:23.583 --> 00:13:27.750
Shouldn't the NHS be the ones
to fund this facility?

256
00:13:27.833 --> 00:13:30.333
The National Health Service has agreed

257
00:13:30.416 --> 00:13:32.333
to fund the running costs of the facility.

258
00:13:32.416 --> 00:13:35.041
but we still need
the initial capital outlay.

259
00:13:35.125 --> 00:13:37.000
[incredulous] Which is considerable.

260
00:13:37.083 --> 00:13:40.500
And our limited resources
are already committed in other areas.

261
00:13:41.083 --> 00:13:45.083
Well… Burnley has already earned
the dubious distinction

262
00:13:45.166 --> 00:13:48.375
of being one of the most
deprived towns in the country.

263
00:13:48.875 --> 00:13:52.250
We're caught in a spiral
of neglect and decay.

264
00:13:52.333 --> 00:13:54.708
I mean. clearly something has to change.

265
00:13:56.875 --> 00:13:58.375
But change takes courage.

266
00:13:59.458 --> 00:14:04.000
That's a quality sadly lacking
in this council. and in this country.

267
00:14:04.083 --> 00:14:05.333
[councillors] Hear. hear.

268
00:14:07.666 --> 00:14:08.708
[gavel slams]

269
00:14:09.458 --> 00:14:11.583
[Hugh] I can't believe
I have to stay for the night.

270
00:14:11.666 --> 00:14:13.166
[Clarence. over phone]<i> You'll survive.</i>

271
00:14:13.666 --> 00:14:16.000
[Hugh] Starting a new bank.
He doesn't have a hope.

272
00:14:16.083 --> 00:14:18.750
<i>I told him that</i>
<i>but he wanted the chance to convince you.</i>

273
00:14:18.833 --> 00:14:21.583
-How much are we charging him?
-<i>The full whack.</i>

274
00:14:21.666 --> 00:14:23.458
Oh. no. we're not. are we?

275
00:14:24.583 --> 00:14:26.041
God. I feel bad.

276
00:14:26.125 --> 00:14:27.875
[scoffs] That's a first.

277
00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.625
[Hugh] <i>No. I do.</i>

278
00:14:29.708 --> 00:14:32.958
I feel bad I'm gonna have to
tell him to give up on the whole thing.

279
00:14:33.041 --> 00:14:34.250
<i>Well. my advice is.</i>

280
00:14:34.333 --> 00:14:38.458
let him down gently and then see if he's
willing to explore other opportunities.

281
00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.291
Yeah. Yeah. I guess…

282
00:14:42.333 --> 00:14:44.833
-Okay. thank you. Bye.
-<i>Alright. Bye. Hugh.</i>

283
00:14:51.416 --> 00:14:53.416
-[horns beeping]
-[car alarm blaring]

284
00:14:54.916 --> 00:14:56.208
Bollocks.

285
00:14:56.291 --> 00:14:58.208
[comical suspenseful music playing]

286
00:14:58.291 --> 00:14:59.333
Bollocks.

287
00:15:00.125 --> 00:15:02.000
Stupid. stupid…

288
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:03.958
[wrench clatters]

289
00:15:04.916 --> 00:15:06.500
[child] What's he doing. Dad?

290
00:15:07.083 --> 00:15:08.708
-[dad] You alright there. mate?
-Huh?

291
00:15:08.791 --> 00:15:11.958
-Are you…?
-Yeah. I'm fine. thank you.

292
00:15:13.875 --> 00:15:14.791
Come on. then.

293
00:15:18.583 --> 00:15:19.583
[jack clangs]

294
00:15:21.208 --> 00:15:22.208
[screams] Bollocks!

295
00:15:22.708 --> 00:15:25.458
-[water bubbling]
-[motor droning]

296
00:15:26.791 --> 00:15:27.958
[exhales] Oh. my God.

297
00:15:31.916 --> 00:15:33.916
-[phone ringing]
-[baby crying]

298
00:15:35.208 --> 00:15:37.041
Hey. hey. sorry.

299
00:15:37.125 --> 00:15:40.083
I was wondering when I'm gonna
get to see a doctor. I'm in a lot of pain.

300
00:15:40.166 --> 00:15:42.333
It won't be too long.
I'm afraid it's been a busy night.

301
00:15:42.416 --> 00:15:45.875
Don't know if this makes a difference.
but I've got a private health care plan.

302
00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:47.125
[scoffs]

303
00:15:47.208 --> 00:15:48.916
-What?
-Hear that. Dr. Ashforth?

304
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.333
He's got a private health care plan.

305
00:15:51.416 --> 00:15:54.583
Oh! Well. wouldn't say that too loud.

306
00:15:54.666 --> 00:15:57.291
Round here we tend to believe
that health is a basic human right.

307
00:15:57.375 --> 00:16:00.041
Not a privilege available
to only those who can afford it.

308
00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:04.125
No. I'm not negating anybody else's pain.
I'm just saying I'm in pain also. okay?

309
00:16:04.208 --> 00:16:05.625
I've dropped a…

310
00:16:05.708 --> 00:16:08.083
A. uh… a car thing on my foot.

311
00:16:08.166 --> 00:16:09.250
Okay?

312
00:16:09.333 --> 00:16:10.791
-[Dr. Ashforth] Careless.
-Excuse me?

313
00:16:10.875 --> 00:16:13.500
Michelle. would you. uh.
give him some aspirin?

314
00:16:13.583 --> 00:16:14.416
Wait your turn.

315
00:16:16.166 --> 00:16:18.666
[barely audible radio broadcast]

316
00:16:25.875 --> 00:16:26.791
Oh. dear.

317
00:16:27.666 --> 00:16:29.250
-What's happened?
-[Hugh] Nothing. Just a…

318
00:16:31.125 --> 00:16:33.416
An accident changing a flat tyre.

319
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:37.250
-Anything broken?
-Thankfully. no. Just my pride.

320
00:16:37.333 --> 00:16:38.333
You muppet.

321
00:16:39.125 --> 00:16:40.041
Is the car still there?

322
00:16:41.291 --> 00:16:42.208
Yes.

323
00:16:42.291 --> 00:16:44.750
I'll have one of the lads get it sorted.
brought back here.

324
00:16:45.458 --> 00:16:46.291
Thank you.

325
00:16:46.375 --> 00:16:48.375
[humming]

326
00:16:49.375 --> 00:16:51.916
[Dave whistling]

327
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Fancy a brew?

328
00:16:53.083 --> 00:16:54.000
[Hugh] No. thank you.

329
00:16:55.583 --> 00:16:56.666
Look. Dave.

330
00:16:57.208 --> 00:17:03.166
I know I said yesterday that it was my job
to look for all the problems and pitfalls.

331
00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:04.166
um…

332
00:17:05.458 --> 00:17:08.000
but. actually. it's a bit worse than that.
because…

333
00:17:08.083 --> 00:17:09.541
[Dave] I know what you're gonna say.

334
00:17:09.625 --> 00:17:12.666
I know you're gonna tell me that
the Bank of Dave is never gonna happen.

335
00:17:13.375 --> 00:17:16.625
You're gonna say
that the Financial Regulation Board

336
00:17:16.708 --> 00:17:19.458
hasn't approved a new bank in 150 years.

337
00:17:20.166 --> 00:17:21.500
-Am I right?
-Yeah.

338
00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:23.458
[Dave] We got Google up here too.

339
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:25.666
But. please.

340
00:17:26.458 --> 00:17:29.250
Indulge me. hmm? Just for a day.

341
00:17:31.041 --> 00:17:32.666
There is method in me madness.

342
00:17:33.791 --> 00:17:35.833
-I promise.
-Okay.

343
00:17:35.916 --> 00:17:38.500
-Second loan I made were to Jamie.
-Okay.

344
00:17:38.583 --> 00:17:40.666
Come out here one morning
and it were quiet.

345
00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:43.375
His amp had packed up.
That's how he made a living.

346
00:17:43.458 --> 00:17:47.500
But with no bank account. no address.
where were he supposed to turn?

347
00:17:48.208 --> 00:17:51.125
So I got him a new one
and he paid me back two quid a week.

348
00:17:51.208 --> 00:17:53.291
-Two quid…
-Never missed a single payment.

349
00:17:54.208 --> 00:17:56.875
-Good on. you. Jamie.
-Eh up. Dave. You alright?

355
00:18:08.416 --> 00:18:10.291
-Have a look at that.
-Ta-da!

356
00:18:10.375 --> 00:18:13.041
-It's gonna be great for the community.
-You swim?

357
00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:16.041
Basketball. cycling. Which one are you?

358
00:18:16.125 --> 00:18:18.458
It sounds stupid. don't it?
It sounds stupid.

359
00:18:18.541 --> 00:18:20.791
A barge builder
at top of a hill in Ribble Valley.

360
00:18:20.875 --> 00:18:23.958
But he's got one of the most successful
barge building companies in the country.

361
00:18:24.041 --> 00:18:25.916
Dream up your favourite boat.
he'll build it.

362
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.708
-Yeah.
-Okay. lads. You gonna wow us?

363
00:18:28.791 --> 00:18:31.250
-[man] Take hold of that.
-[Hugh] Okay. thank you.

364
00:18:31.333 --> 00:18:33.166
-Cheers. Hugh.
-I'm spoiled. Cheers.

365
00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:34.416
-Okay. cheers.
-To us all.

366
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.625

00:18:39.375 --> 00:18:41.750
-That's a proper drop. isn't it?
-Yeah. it's good.

369
00:18:41.833 --> 00:18:42.958
[man] That's really nice.

370
00:18:43.041 --> 00:18:44.333
-This is my favourite.
-Okay.

371
00:18:44.416 --> 00:18:46.625
This is gentle. This is the coconut.

372
00:18:46.708 --> 00:18:47.625
[Hugo] Gentle's good.

373
00:18:48.458 --> 00:18:49.666
Want a bit more? The Goan.

374
00:18:51.083 --> 00:18:53.291
-Very nice.
-[Dave] Now. have some of this.

375
00:18:53.375 --> 00:18:55.791
-Delicious.
-This is the mild one?

376
00:18:55.875 --> 00:18:58.333
-Have a bit of naan with it.
-Yeah. why not? Thank you.

377
00:18:58.416 --> 00:19:00.708
-Thank you.
-[Dave] You make these as well. don't you?

378
00:19:00.791 --> 00:19:02.333
-[woman] Yeah.
-It's-- I…

379
00:19:03.125 --> 00:19:05.333
-It's to the highest standards.
-Yeah.

380
00:19:05.416 --> 00:19:08.416
-Good to know.
-It's vegan. Not tested on animals.

381
00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.500
-That's good.
-Try some of this.

382
00:19:10.583 --> 00:19:12.208
-Have a squirt.
-Good quality.

383
00:19:12.291 --> 00:19:14.416
-[Dave] Shocking blue…
-[woman] Have a smell.

384
00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:15.875
Rub it round. It's nice.

385
00:19:15.958 --> 00:19:18.541
That scent will stay with you
for the rest of the day. so…

386
00:19:18.625 --> 00:19:20.125
I put it on some of my horses.

387
00:19:20.208 --> 00:19:21.791
This lady's an artist.

388
00:19:21.875 --> 00:19:24.208
Anyone to apologise to?
Say sorry to the wife?

389
00:19:24.291 --> 00:19:25.791
-Thank you.
-Have you got a wife?

390
00:19:26.375 --> 00:19:29.083
Afternoon all.
Two black coffees. please Jenny.

391
00:19:29.166 --> 00:19:31.416
-[Hugh] A macchiato with oat milk?
-There she is!

392
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:32.958
-My favourite niece.
-Hiya. Dave.

393
00:19:33.041 --> 00:19:34.541
-[Dave] How are you?
-Good. how are you?

394
00:19:34.625 --> 00:19:35.750
[Dave] Smashing.

395
00:19:35.833 --> 00:19:36.791
Oh. shit. Hi.

396
00:19:36.875 --> 00:19:40.875
-Should've known you were Dave's banker.
-I'm a lawyer. actually. but. yeah…

397
00:19:40.958 --> 00:19:43.000
How's the bruised big toe?

398
00:19:43.083 --> 00:19:45.625
It's a bit more than bruised.
but it's okay.

399
00:19:45.708 --> 00:19:47.041
[Dave] You've met already?

400
00:19:47.125 --> 00:19:48.166
-Yes.
-Yeah.

401
00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:50.958
Hugh's advising me on setting up
this Bank of Dave.

402
00:19:51.458 --> 00:19:54.500
Which we need
to get our project off the ground.

403
00:19:54.583 --> 00:19:56.375
-Hmm.
-Sorry. what is that?

404
00:19:56.458 --> 00:19:59.000
You know all about
waiting times at the A&amp;E.

405
00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.750
Here. they're some of the worst
in the country.

406
00:20:01.833 --> 00:20:05.541
and it's because the people we deal with
don't actually need hospital treatment.

407
00:20:05.625 --> 00:20:08.916
Their ailments could just as easily
be treated by GPs.

408
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.750
but it takes. on average.
11 days to get an appointment.

409
00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:13.625
And. well…

410
00:20:14.166 --> 00:20:16.375
No one wants to wait that long
when they're sick.

411
00:20:16.958 --> 00:20:20.333
So. we're proposing a walk-in free clinic.

412
00:20:21.125 --> 00:20:23.083
They can write prescriptions.

413
00:20:23.166 --> 00:20:25.958
run diagnostic tests. make referrals.

414
00:20:26.041 --> 00:20:27.416
Sounds like a good idea.

415
00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:28.541
-[Dave] Don't it?
-Yeah.

416
00:20:28.625 --> 00:20:30.291
The NHS agrees.

417
00:20:30.375 --> 00:20:33.083
but they've already
been pared to the bone.

418
00:20:33.166 --> 00:20:36.208
And the council weren't interested
so thought I'd try Dave.

419
00:20:36.291 --> 00:20:38.250
If you were to register as a charity.

420
00:20:38.333 --> 00:20:41.208
that'd be a huge incentive
for corporate sponsors.

421
00:20:41.291 --> 00:20:43.541
I mean. I know it's corporate. but…

422
00:20:44.041 --> 00:20:46.875
No. that…
Yeah. that makes a lot of sense. actually.

423
00:20:46.958 --> 00:20:47.791
[phone vibrates]

424
00:20:47.875 --> 00:20:50.166
-Oh. Sorry. I'm on call.
-Oh. right.

425
00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.458
-Got to run. I'll leave that there.
-Okay.

426
00:20:53.333 --> 00:20:54.416
Great.

427
00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.708
-Well. nice to…
-Yeah. Look after that bruised big toe.

428
00:20:58.208 --> 00:20:59.666
I will. It's fine now. actually.

429
00:21:00.416 --> 00:21:01.958
Not completely fine. but…

430
00:21:02.041 --> 00:21:03.125
-Right.
-Yeah.

431
00:21:03.208 --> 00:21:04.708
-See you. Dave.
-[Dave] See you.

432
00:21:09.041 --> 00:21:10.708
-Thanks.
-[Jenny] No. problem. Alex.

433
00:21:10.791 --> 00:21:11.750
So. she's…

434
00:21:13.666 --> 00:21:14.708
What's all this?

435
00:21:15.875 --> 00:21:18.375
All the projects that are too big
for me on me own.

436
00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:22.416
Um…

437
00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:26.333
-Up till now. I've helped create 150 jobs.
-Yeah.

438
00:21:26.416 --> 00:21:28.416
In here. there's hundreds more.

439
00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.625
-I get it. Dave.
-It's not just jobs.

440
00:21:31.875 --> 00:21:34.666
It's about the quality of life
for a whole community.

441
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:36.583
This is all really impressive.

442
00:21:37.208 --> 00:21:41.458
Okay. but unfortunately. the Financial
Regulation Board doesn't care about this.

443
00:21:43.916 --> 00:21:45.666
Question I want you to answer

444
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.083
isn't "can the Bank of Dave exist?"

445
00:21:49.958 --> 00:21:53.083
The question.
after what you've seen today.

446
00:21:53.875 --> 00:21:55.875
is "should the Bank of Dave exist?"

447
00:21:57.125 --> 00:21:58.375
Well…

448
00:21:59.791 --> 00:22:01.666
Yes. Yes. it should.

449
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:02.666
Right.

450
00:22:04.083 --> 00:22:06.208
So. this is what I want you to do.

451
00:22:07.208 --> 00:22:12.666
I want you to file the necessary paperwork
with the Finance Commission Board.

452
00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:14.750
I know they're gonna turn me down.

453
00:22:16.875 --> 00:22:18.583
but I want them to tell me why.

454
00:22:20.583 --> 00:22:22.583
I want them to admit publicly

455
00:22:23.833 --> 00:22:25.833
that it's because I'm not in their club.

456
00:22:27.083 --> 00:22:29.958
I'm not part of the Eton and Oxford elite.

457
00:22:31.666 --> 00:22:33.083
I want them to say

458
00:22:33.166 --> 00:22:38.041
that the very same people
who've just lost 500 billion quid

459
00:22:38.125 --> 00:22:42.041
are the only people
entitled to look after our money.

460
00:22:42.666 --> 00:22:44.125
And you don't mind losing?

461
00:22:44.958 --> 00:22:46.416
Of course I bloody mind.

462
00:22:47.583 --> 00:22:50.708
But it's the price I'm willing to pay
to get them to admit the truth.

463
00:22:51.208 --> 00:22:52.083
Okay. yeah.

464
00:22:53.041 --> 00:22:54.000
Yeah. I'm in.

465
00:22:56.666 --> 00:22:59.166
I'll give your boss a bell.
Tell him you're still on the clock.

466
00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:00.791
[laughs] That'll make his day.

467
00:23:01.375 --> 00:23:03.708
Alright. Time to celebrate.

468
00:23:04.583 --> 00:23:06.583
And. as luck would have it…

469
00:23:07.541 --> 00:23:09.125
tonight's karaoke night.

470
00:23:09.208 --> 00:23:10.541
Oh. no. thank you.

471
00:23:11.041 --> 00:23:12.500
Alexandra will be there.

472
00:23:14.583 --> 00:23:15.458
Really?

473
00:23:15.541 --> 00:23:17.000
[laughter]

474
00:23:17.958 --> 00:23:21.083
[Dave] What I didn't tell you
is that Eric used to be shop steward

475
00:23:21.166 --> 00:23:23.333
at the Michelin factory
before it closed down.

476
00:23:23.416 --> 00:23:25.375
And he was a real bloody troublemaker.

477
00:23:25.916 --> 00:23:28.916
-Now he employs 25 workers.
-Thirty.

478
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.875
-This bugger turned me into a capitalist.
-It happens.

479
00:23:31.958 --> 00:23:34.333
Can barely look at myself in the mirror
of a morning.

480
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:35.833
-Hugh…
-[Hugh] Thanks.

481
00:23:35.916 --> 00:23:38.500
-I'd like to introduce you to Maureen.
-Nice to meet you.

482
00:23:38.583 --> 00:23:42.166
First loan I made that weren't
for a van or a minibus were to Maureen.

483
00:23:42.666 --> 00:23:46.833
I heard you got yourself a posh
London lawyer to sort out this bank thing.

484
00:23:46.916 --> 00:23:48.916
When you take on the fat cats.

485
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.708
you gotta have someone
who knows how to play their game.

486
00:23:51.791 --> 00:23:56.916
I told Dave he was wasting his time with
the idea. but he's managed to convince me.

487
00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.416
-Dave can be very persuasive.
-Yes.

488
00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:02.333
I hope. for his sake. you're half as good.

489
00:24:02.416 --> 00:24:04.375
Well… hopefully.

490
00:24:04.458 --> 00:24:06.958
So. you received the first loan from Dave?

491
00:24:08.083 --> 00:24:10.750
Yeah. I were married to Ron for 38 years.

492
00:24:10.833 --> 00:24:13.916
When he died.
I had very little money in the bank.

493
00:24:14.458 --> 00:24:18.125
I couldn't have afforded a proper funeral
without Dave and Nicky's help.

494
00:24:18.208 --> 00:24:20.041
-[mic feedback]
-[host] Right. first up.

495
00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:22.416
All the way from London…

496
00:24:23.041 --> 00:24:24.083
It's Hugh.

497
00:24:24.166 --> 00:24:25.791
-[Eric] Get up there.
-[Dave] Go on.

498
00:24:25.875 --> 00:24:27.083
-[Maureen] That's you.
-No.

499
00:24:27.166 --> 00:24:28.916
-I picked an easy one.
-Not nice.

500
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.625
-[Dave] You'll be fine.
-No. no.

501
00:24:30.708 --> 00:24:33.083
-You know this one. you'll like this.
-No. thank you.

502
00:24:33.166 --> 00:24:36.166
-Let's give him a round of applause.
-[Hugh] No. thank you.

503
00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:39.291
-No. right. I'll just press play.
-[Dave] Hugh!

He's keeping you on
at your full hourly rate.

They've created a model
of what a bank should be.

-FRB will never go for it. though.
-No. of course they won't.

572
00:27:43.416 --> 00:27:47.916
But they are going to have to justify
why the status quo is so much better.

573
00:27:48.416 --> 00:27:51.583
So. you want to take them on
in the court of public opinion?

574
00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:56.000
That's not a bad idea. given the public
opinion has never being so negative.

and we don't mind losing.

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:25.875
I have made you a very strong coffee.

675
00:33:25.958 --> 00:33:27.000
Thank you.

676
00:33:27.833 --> 00:33:30.833
Sorry about last night.
I was in shocking shape.

677
00:33:30.916 --> 00:33:32.875
Don't be. I was glad I was there to help.

678
00:33:34.291 --> 00:33:35.833
Can we go for dinner soon?

679
00:33:35.916 --> 00:33:39.208
You know. like normal people.
When I'm not completely off my face.

680
00:33:39.833 --> 00:33:41.416
Yes. Whenever you like.

681
00:33:42.583 --> 00:33:43.416
Tonight?

682
00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:47.333
Yeah.

683
00:33:47.875 --> 00:33:48.750
Um…

684
00:33:49.833 --> 00:33:51.041
Yeah.

685
00:33:53.083 --> 00:33:55.500
-How's it going?
-Good. Getting there.

686
00:33:55.583 --> 00:33:58.833
Excellent. Because I found someone
you should speak to.

687
00:33:59.541 --> 00:34:02.291
Sir Charles Denbigh. Friend of a friend.

688
00:34:02.375 --> 00:34:05.416
He was on the board of the FRB
until three years ago.

689
00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:08.500
These days. he mainly does
legal consultancy for hedge funds.

690
00:34:08.583 --> 00:34:10.291
And he's going to be helpful?

691
00:34:10.375 --> 00:34:12.208
This needs to go public.

692
00:34:12.291 --> 00:34:15.541
Spin Sir Charles a convincing yarn.
he won't be able to help himself.

693
00:34:15.625 --> 00:34:16.958
He'll be on the phone right away

694
00:34:17.041 --> 00:34:19.500
to his friends in high places
in the banking world.

695
00:34:19.583 --> 00:34:22.333
Then you can tap
into the one thing you have on your side.

696
00:34:22.416 --> 00:34:23.916
Everybody hates bankers.

697
00:34:24.458 --> 00:34:25.666
Precisely.

698
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:27.875
Toodle pip.

699
00:34:31.708 --> 00:34:33.375
Everybody hates bankers.

700
00:34:34.375 --> 00:34:38.208
-[classical piano playing softly]
-[indistinct male chatter]

701
00:34:40.708 --> 00:34:42.333
[clears throat] Sir Charles?

702
00:34:42.416 --> 00:34:43.541
Hmm.

703
00:34:44.291 --> 00:34:46.583
Hugh Stockwell from Bentham and Green.

704
00:34:47.791 --> 00:34:48.958
Oh. you work with… Lawrence.

705
00:34:49.041 --> 00:34:51.583
-Yeah. Clarence. Yes.
-[Charles] Clarence?

706
00:34:51.666 --> 00:34:52.583
Oh…

707
00:34:54.125 --> 00:34:55.291
I've never met the man.

708
00:34:55.375 --> 00:34:58.625
In fact. until yesterday.
I'd never even heard of him. [laughs]

709
00:34:58.708 --> 00:35:01.000
But. anyway. you're here now. so…

710
00:35:01.083 --> 00:35:02.583
How can I be of service?

711
00:35:02.666 --> 00:35:03.666
Firstly. thank you.

712
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:07.208
Everybody tells me you're the country's
leading expert on the banking system.

713
00:35:07.291 --> 00:35:09.875
Oh. well. I've put in my time.

714
00:35:10.791 --> 00:35:11.666
I'll be brief.

715
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:16.500
I represent a client who is looking
into establishing a new retail bank.

716
00:35:17.166 --> 00:35:18.833
[whispers] Not an American. I hope.

717
00:35:18.916 --> 00:35:23.208
[laughs] No. The gentleman in question
is definitely English.

718
00:35:23.291 --> 00:35:24.208
-Yah.
-Um…

719
00:35:24.291 --> 00:35:26.250
The question is more about scale.

720
00:35:26.791 --> 00:35:29.875
In the rest of the economy.
we have large and small companies.

721
00:35:29.958 --> 00:35:33.000
We have a chain of supermarkets
and corner shops.

722
00:35:33.083 --> 00:35:35.291
-Greengrocers. butchers.
-Your point?

723
00:35:35.375 --> 00:35:36.708
Well. my point is.

724
00:35:36.791 --> 00:35:40.250
why do all banks
have to be like supermarkets?

725
00:35:41.041 --> 00:35:43.041
Isn't there room for a few corner shops?

726
00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:47.208
You're talking about Hoares.

727
00:35:48.541 --> 00:35:49.375
Am I?

728
00:35:49.458 --> 00:35:51.708
Oldest bank in the country. tiny.

729
00:35:52.583 --> 00:35:56.500
Caters for very exclusive clientele.
old money.

730
00:35:56.583 --> 00:35:59.375
No. Wh… What about people
on the other end of the spectrum?

731
00:35:59.458 --> 00:36:00.708
New money?

732
00:36:00.791 --> 00:36:01.708
No money.

733
00:36:03.708 --> 00:36:04.625
[puzzled laugh]

734
00:36:05.666 --> 00:36:09.708
I'm not… quite sure
what you're getting at. Mr Stockwell.

735
00:36:09.791 --> 00:36:12.666
but there is no right size of bank.

736
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:14.875
The FRB exists to make sure

737
00:36:14.958 --> 00:36:19.083
that people's hard-earned money
is entrusted to the… [inhales]

738
00:36:19.166 --> 00:36:21.375
…well. right kind of chap.

739
00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:24.708
-[Hugh] The type of chap you can trust?
-Precisely.

740
00:36:24.791 --> 00:36:28.541
If their job is selecting
the type of chap you can trust…

741
00:36:29.875 --> 00:36:31.083
[puffs] …you'd have to admit

742
00:36:31.166 --> 00:36:33.875
they've been doing
a pretty piss-poor job. haven't they?

743
00:36:34.375 --> 00:36:37.041
-I beg your pardon.
-Anyway. thank you. Sir Charles.

744
00:36:37.125 --> 00:36:41.458
My client<i> is</i> the type of chap
people in his community can trust. So…

745
00:36:42.333 --> 00:36:44.208
I'm sure there won't be any problems.

746
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.041
Thank you.

747
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:56.583
[grunts]

748
00:36:56.666 --> 00:36:59.458
-[Hugh] What do you think?
<i>-</i>[Dave. on phone] <i>Looks bloody fantastic.</i>

749
00:37:00.166 --> 00:37:02.291
Wouldn't be surprised if they say yes.

750
00:37:02.375 --> 00:37:04.958
[chuckles] I don't know about that. Dave.

751
00:37:05.041 --> 00:37:09.708
I'm going to hand-deliver this
to the FRB on Friday. so speak soon.

752
00:37:09.791 --> 00:37:10.625
Okay?

753
00:37:11.375 --> 00:37:12.333
Cheers.

754
00:37:13.541 --> 00:37:15.041
How was your day. anyway?

755
00:37:15.541 --> 00:37:16.875
[sighs] Fraught.

756
00:37:16.958 --> 00:37:18.958
Everyone was being incredibly nice to me.

757
00:37:19.041 --> 00:37:21.333
which is a sure sign
they're gonna get rid of you.

758
00:37:21.416 --> 00:37:23.125
-How about you?
-Ah…

759
00:37:23.208 --> 00:37:25.166
I had a meeting with Sir Charles Denbigh.

760
00:37:27.125 --> 00:37:28.833
-You're kidding.
-Yeah. I did.

761
00:37:29.666 --> 00:37:31.666
-He's a legend.
-Is he. though?

762
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:35.083
Yes. He was tipped
to be the possible governor

763
00:37:35.166 --> 00:37:37.125
of the Bank of England
before the recession.

764
00:37:37.208 --> 00:37:38.666
What did he want to talk about?

765
00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:41.000
Nothing. I was picking his brains
about something.

766
00:37:41.083 --> 00:37:44.333
-Um…
-Meetings with Sir Charles Denbigh.

767
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.083
-Secret trips to the North.
-Hmm.

768
00:37:47.166 --> 00:37:49.791
-It's hardly secret. Hen.
-What are you involved in. Hugh?

769
00:37:49.875 --> 00:37:51.875
-Not involved…
-Come on. spill.

770
00:37:53.833 --> 00:37:56.583
I'm filling the formal paperwork out
at the end of the week.

771
00:37:56.666 --> 00:37:58.625
so till then.
it has to be just between us.

772
00:37:58.708 --> 00:37:59.583
Of course.

773
00:38:00.708 --> 00:38:04.583
I have a client
who wants to start a new bank.

774
00:38:05.458 --> 00:38:06.291
You're kidding.

775
00:38:06.375 --> 00:38:08.833
He's aware the FRB
will inevitably turn him down.

776
00:38:08.916 --> 00:38:12.291
but he wants to force them to go public
with what they think a bank should be.

777
00:38:13.916 --> 00:38:15.916
Well. that'll certainly stir things up.

778
00:38:17.125 --> 00:38:18.458
Your client's credible?

779
00:38:19.375 --> 00:38:21.500
[doubtful laugh] Yeah.

780
00:38:21.583 --> 00:38:23.541
He's certainly a character. but…

781
00:38:25.416 --> 00:38:26.833
But. yeah. I think he is.

782
00:38:27.833 --> 00:38:28.833
[Hen] Hmm.

783
00:38:35.375 --> 00:38:36.625
-May I help you?
-Hey.

784
00:38:36.708 --> 00:38:40.791
I'm here to submit a proposal
for the establishment of a new bank.

785
00:38:40.875 --> 00:38:41.791
[laughs]

786
00:38:41.875 --> 00:38:44.208
I'm not sure that's something
we deal with here.

787
00:38:44.291 --> 00:38:48.041
According to the Financial Markets
and Services Act passed in 2000. it is.

788
00:38:48.833 --> 00:38:50.125
Oh… uh…

789
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:53.500
If you'd like to take a seat.
I'll find someone who can help.

790
00:38:53.583 --> 00:38:54.416
-Thank you.
-Okay.

791
00:38:56.541 --> 00:38:57.666
[phone clatters. dial tone]

792
00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:05.916
-Apologies for keeping you waiting.
-Hey.

Edward De Thame.

794
00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.333
Hugh Stockwell from Bentham and Green.

795
00:39:09.416 --> 00:39:11.041
Here is the proposal.

796
00:39:12.375 --> 00:39:15.291
It's a long time since we've had
an application for a new bank.

797
00:39:15.375 --> 00:39:17.916
-150 years. I'm told.
-Indeed.

798
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.250
-Right. we'll be in touch. Right.
-Brilliant.

799
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:34.375
[man. over phone]
<i>Giles. Sir Charles Denbigh on line one.</i>

800

[clears throat]

802
00:39:39.041 --> 00:39:41.041
Sir Charles. What can I do for you?

803
00:39:41.125 --> 00:39:45.125
Your friend Hugh Stockwell
is causing us problems.

804
00:39:45.791 --> 00:39:48.041
[Giles] <i>Hugh? He's not exactly a friend.</i>

805
00:39:48.125 --> 00:39:50.833
<i>We hired him a while back</i>
<i>just to do some legal donkey work.</i>

806
00:39:51.666 --> 00:39:54.708
He's just filed with the FRB
to set up a new bank.

807
00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:59.208
[Giles] <i>Doesn't sound like Hugh.</i>
<i>He's hardly a high-flyer.</i>

808
00:39:59.291 --> 00:40:01.500
Well. it's hardly
a high-flying bank either.

809
00:40:01.583 --> 00:40:03.125
More of a corner shop.

810
00:40:03.208 --> 00:40:06.375
I see. So. less of a problem.

811
00:40:06.458 --> 00:40:07.958
[Charles] <i>Quite the opposite.</i>

812
00:40:08.041 --> 00:40:11.416
<i>It's one thing rich foreign corporations</i>
<i>trying to home in on our business.</i>

813
00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:13.541
We know how to deal
with those buggers. but once…

814
00:40:14.083 --> 00:40:17.416
ordinary people start thinking
they can get in on the act.

815
00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:19.000
the floodgates'll open.

816
00:40:21.166 --> 00:40:23.791
Of course. I see. So…

817
00:40:23.875 --> 00:40:25.500
So how can I help. Sir Charles?

818
00:40:25.583 --> 00:40:27.791
<i>I may need to call on you at some point.</i>

819
00:40:27.875 --> 00:40:30.125
For now. I have the situation
well in hand.

[Hen. on phone]
<i>Sir Charles. Do we have a deal?</i>

824
00:40:44.666 --> 00:40:47.583
[Charles] Send me that page
and you'll have your promotion.

Hello.

835
00:41:32.625 --> 00:41:33.958
[Alexandra]<i> Dave's been arrested.</i>

836
00:41:35.833 --> 00:41:36.916
On what charge?

837
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.291
Loan sharking.

838
00:41:39.083 --> 00:41:40.250
[Hugh] <i>Really?</i>

839
00:41:41.041 --> 00:41:43.750
[hesitates] Um. I… I'll call you back.

840
00:41:49.916 --> 00:41:54.166
I can't find anything illegal here.
These are all person-to-person loans.

841
00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:57.458
Unless there's coercion or threats
of violence. it's not loan sharking.

842
00:41:57.541 --> 00:41:59.083
Go to page 11.

843
00:42:04.458 --> 00:42:06.125
I haven't got page 11.

844
00:42:07.083 --> 00:42:08.625
Probably still in the photocopier.

845
00:42:08.708 --> 00:42:11.666
You've got the photocopied version.
These are the originals.

846
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:14.583
The first loan Dave made
was through Fishwick Motors.

847
00:42:15.458 --> 00:42:17.333
[Hugh] So what? He has a lending licence.

848
00:42:17.416 --> 00:42:20.000
He's allowed to lend money
to buy a van or a minibus.

849
00:42:20.083 --> 00:42:21.416
This is for funeral expenses.

850
00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:23.375
Surely that's just a minor technicality.

851
00:42:23.458 --> 00:42:26.708
It's illegal money lending.
for which you'll get a slap on the wrist.

852
00:42:26.791 --> 00:42:28.125
and a criminal record.

853
00:42:29.333 --> 00:42:31.833
-Of course.
-I told you they'd fight dirty.

854
00:42:38.125 --> 00:42:39.541
[Dave] This isn't a big deal.

855
00:42:39.625 --> 00:42:41.791
They let me out on bail
after a couple of hours.

856
00:42:41.875 --> 00:42:43.791
-But they did charge you?
-Yeah.

857
00:42:43.875 --> 00:42:46.166
-Can I see the charge sheet?
-[Dave] Alright.

858
00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:47.500
-[Hugh] Hello.
-Hi.

859
00:42:47.583 --> 00:42:49.166
[Hugh] This is actually very serious.

860
00:42:49.958 --> 00:42:52.541
The police said the magistrates
might fine me a few quid.

861
00:42:52.625 --> 00:42:55.541
-I'm not gonna prison.
-But you would have a criminal record.

862
00:42:55.625 --> 00:42:59.041
Which means you wouldn't be able to run
a financial institution.

863
00:42:59.125 --> 00:43:01.666
Exactly. If they get a conviction
for this. they've won.

864
00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:02.958
There's no more Bank of Dave.

865
00:43:05.166 --> 00:43:06.500
[Nicky] There you go. love.

866
00:43:06.583 --> 00:43:07.791
-[Dave sighs]
-[Hugh] Thank you.

867
00:43:09.541 --> 00:43:10.583
[Hugh clears throat]

868
00:43:11.208 --> 00:43:13.458
It weren't even supposed to be a loan.

869
00:43:14.083 --> 00:43:15.000
Sorry?

870
00:43:16.458 --> 00:43:20.666
The one they're talking about.
The first… to Maureen.

871
00:43:21.333 --> 00:43:24.166
-Yeah.
-I've known her and Ron for years.

872
00:43:25.333 --> 00:43:27.166
He deserved a proper send-off.

873
00:43:27.916 --> 00:43:30.708
I were happy to pay for it.
but Maureen didn't want charity.

874
00:43:30.791 --> 00:43:31.625
So.

875
00:43:32.583 --> 00:43:36.291
I used one of the forms from
Fishwick Motors to make it into a loan.

876
00:43:37.791 --> 00:43:41.125
When she paid me back.
I had to file the paperwork.

877
00:43:41.208 --> 00:43:42.291
[sighs]

878
00:43:42.375 --> 00:43:44.333
So… what's Dave's defence?

879
00:43:44.416 --> 00:43:46.416
-[Hugh] He doesn't have one.
-What?

880
00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:50.333
Sorry. but your husband committed a crime.
Obviously a very small one.

881
00:43:50.416 --> 00:43:53.125
and with good intentions.
but it's there in black and white.

882
00:43:53.208 --> 00:43:56.333
No jury or magistrate in the country's
going to find him not guilty.

883
00:43:56.416 --> 00:43:57.583
-It's…
-[Dave sighs]

884
00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:01.458
-[Hugh] If we…
-[sighs]

885
00:44:01.541 --> 00:44:05.500
If we could prove that the charges
were filed with malicious intent.

886
00:44:05.583 --> 00:44:09.916
and the intention wasn't to punish Dave.
but the wider Burnley community.

887
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.208
It's a long shot but I think
it's worth a go. What do you think?

888
00:44:13.291 --> 00:44:14.250
[Alexandra] I like it.

889
00:44:14.333 --> 00:44:16.416
You'll have to put on
a hell of a performance

890
00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:17.791
to convince the magistrates.

891
00:44:17.875 --> 00:44:19.166
Like. "I want the truth."

892
00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:20.833
"You can't handle the truth."

893
00:44:20.916 --> 00:44:24.333
-Oh. I love that film.
-I've actually never seen it.

894
00:44:24.416 --> 00:44:25.916
-You've not seen it?
-No.

895
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.291
I've just seen that scene.

896
00:44:27.375 --> 00:44:29.458
-Classic.
-I love it. Dave's not seen it.

897
00:44:29.541 --> 00:44:31.958
-Can we bring it back to me. please?
-[all] Yes.

898
00:44:32.041 --> 00:44:33.875
-What are we doing?
-Right. so…

899
00:44:33.958 --> 00:44:38.375
I'll come to the showroom and go through
all the numbers with your accountant.

900
00:44:38.458 --> 00:44:39.541
How can I help?

901
00:44:41.083 --> 00:44:42.166
Oh. well. um…

902
00:44:42.708 --> 00:44:45.708
Well. someone made the complaint
which led to the arrest.

903
00:44:45.791 --> 00:44:48.208
and it'd be great to find out who it was.

904
00:44:48.291 --> 00:44:50.708
I have a friend in the police.
I can speak to her.

905
00:44:50.791 --> 00:44:52.708
I can also speak to my sister.

906
00:44:53.208 --> 00:44:54.833
-Yeah?
-[Alexandra] She's a reporter.

907
00:44:54.916 --> 00:44:55.750
[Hugh] Great.

908
00:44:55.833 --> 00:44:57.375
No. you won't be needed in court.

909
00:44:57.458 --> 00:45:00.625
but a statement for the record
would be great. If you could manage it.

910
00:45:01.791 --> 00:45:03.333
Yeah? Brilliant.

911
00:45:03.416 --> 00:45:05.041
Okay. speak soon.

912
00:45:05.125 --> 00:45:07.083
Um… [clears throat] …Dave?

913
00:45:07.791 --> 00:45:09.125
-I just--
-[Dave] Hugh. come here.

914
00:45:09.208 --> 00:45:10.375
I want you to meet someone.

915
00:45:10.458 --> 00:45:13.625
This is Rick Purdey.
legendary music promoter.

916
00:45:13.708 --> 00:45:14.833
-[Hugh] Hey.
-Hello.

917
00:45:14.916 --> 00:45:17.208
Hugh's a lawyer from London.
but don't hold it against him.

918
00:45:17.291 --> 00:45:18.500
Fuck me. Double whammy.

919
00:45:18.583 --> 00:45:21.083
Yeah. Rick's managed some amazing bands.

920
00:45:21.833 --> 00:45:23.916
Really? Any I would've heard of?

921
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.041
-Saxon. Bad Company…
-Okay.

922
00:45:26.125 --> 00:45:28.416
-[Rick] Def Leppard.
-No. shut up. No. you don't.

923
00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:30.125
[Rick] They're still going strong.

924
00:45:30.208 --> 00:45:32.875
I'm still in touch with the lads.
Rich lives down the road.

925
00:45:32.958 --> 00:45:36.000
Does he? I used to play a bit…

926
00:45:36.875 --> 00:45:38.083
Are you still managing?

927
00:45:38.166 --> 00:45:41.833
No. I got out. That end of the business
got a bit corporate.

928
00:45:41.916 --> 00:45:44.083
-Of course.
-Still keep your hand in. though.

929
00:45:44.166 --> 00:45:46.708
I spend most of my time
helping my son Jake.

930
00:45:46.791 --> 00:45:49.500
He's managing this great local
band called The Goa Express.

931
00:45:49.583 --> 00:45:50.625
Goa Express.

932
00:45:50.708 --> 00:45:53.333
Part of my job
is getting him a new minibus

933
00:45:53.416 --> 00:45:55.208
'cause they smashed up the last one.

934
00:45:55.291 --> 00:45:56.416
Rock 'n roll. eh. Dave?

935
00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:59.333
-You're getting mates' rates.
-Bless you.

936
00:45:59.416 --> 00:46:01.250
Rock 'n roll. yeah. God. Def Leppard.

937
00:46:01.333 --> 00:46:03.166
-I mean. I…
-[phone ringing]

938
00:46:03.250 --> 00:46:05.208
Eh… Um…

939
00:46:05.291 --> 00:46:06.958
-Nice to meet you.
-You too. mate.

940
00:46:07.583 --> 00:46:08.916
Hello. Hugh Stockwell.

941
00:46:11.333 --> 00:46:12.166
Vans?

942
00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:13.541
[giggling]

943
00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:15.958
I need to talk to you about Dave.

944
00:46:16.541 --> 00:46:18.000
-Fishwick?
-Yeah.

945
00:46:18.083 --> 00:46:19.791
Your lot arrested him a few days ago.

946
00:46:20.458 --> 00:46:22.958
Not us. London sent a team up.

947
00:46:23.458 --> 00:46:25.958
When we heard. we thought
they must have their wires crossed.

948
00:46:26.458 --> 00:46:28.791
Dave's an hustler. no question.

949
00:46:28.875 --> 00:46:31.416
And he's fond of the sound
of his own voice.

950
00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:33.916
-[both laugh]
-But he's hardly a loan shark.

951
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.291
He lends a few bob
to friends and local businesses.

952
00:46:36.375 --> 00:46:38.125
Yeah. close to a million quid.

953
00:46:38.833 --> 00:46:39.666
You're kidding.

954
00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:43.666
We need to find out
who filed the original complaint.

955
00:46:45.708 --> 00:46:48.666
You know I can't share details
of an ongoing investigation.

956
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:50.125
I think he's being set up. Vi.

957
00:46:50.666 --> 00:46:54.291
Someone's trying to use the police
and courts to take him outta the game.

958
00:46:54.791 --> 00:46:56.708
I just want to do what's right.

959
00:46:56.791 --> 00:46:59.791
I really think Dave
could do some good for Burnley.

960
00:47:00.291 --> 00:47:03.291
[Hugh. on phone] <i>Yes. but I'm a solicitor.</i>
<i>Clarence. Like you.</i>

961
00:47:03.375 --> 00:47:06.291
<i>I don't stand up in court</i>
<i>and shout at people.</i>

962
00:47:06.375 --> 00:47:08.416
But admit it. you want to.

963
00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:12.125
Yeah. but I don't think this is the
best time to indulge my fantasies.

964
00:47:12.208 --> 00:47:13.666
Maybe we should get a barrister.

965
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:16.208
[Clarence]<i> They don't appear very often</i>
<i>in Magistrate's Court.</i>

966
00:47:16.291 --> 00:47:20.416
and when they do. the assumption is
that it's because their client is guilty.

967
00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:23.750
Yes. but in this case.
my client is guilty. so…

968
00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:25.916
[Clarence] <i>You'll do fine. Hugh.</i>

969
00:47:27.875 --> 00:47:28.708
Thank you.

970
00:47:28.791 --> 00:47:29.750
Thanks.

971
00:47:31.041 --> 00:47:32.541
Saw you on TV.

972
00:47:32.625 --> 00:47:35.333
Can you believe they finally
let me present my own story?

973
00:47:35.416 --> 00:47:36.875
You were brilliant.

974
00:47:36.958 --> 00:47:39.041
I always knew
you'd be the star of the family.

975
00:47:39.125 --> 00:47:40.416
Tell that to Mum and Dad.

976
00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:44.500
Doesn't matter what I do. you got into
Cambridge and now you're saving lives.

977
00:47:44.583 --> 00:47:47.583
-We're both not doing too badly. are we?
-Mm-hmm.

978
00:47:47.666 --> 00:47:49.875
We're finally out on the lash. Come on.

979
00:47:49.958 --> 00:47:53.208
No. No way.
I'm in surgery at 9:00 tomorrow.

980
00:47:53.291 --> 00:47:56.125
Course you are.
but we're celebrating my first big story.

981
00:47:56.916 --> 00:47:59.791
Speaking of…
Have you got your next one yet?

982
00:47:59.875 --> 00:48:01.333
I'm working on it.

983
00:48:01.833 --> 00:48:03.083
Got any ideas?

984
00:48:03.166 --> 00:48:04.208
I might.

985
00:48:05.291 --> 00:48:06.750
[Dave] I just sell minibuses.

986
00:48:07.416 --> 00:48:10.500
I used to sell vans. Any colour you like
so long as it's white.

987
00:48:11.208 --> 00:48:12.625
Just kidding. Any road…

988
00:48:13.208 --> 00:48:16.500
When I was selling vans.
I met hundreds. maybe thousands

989
00:48:16.583 --> 00:48:19.416
of small businesses.
Who doesn't need a van. right?

990
00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:20.916
But they all need money.

991
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.708
To expand or survive.

992
00:48:23.375 --> 00:48:25.083
How's somebody in London

993
00:48:25.166 --> 00:48:27.958
supposed to decide
if they're a good investment? Hmm?

994
00:48:28.458 --> 00:48:30.833
I'm with Dave 100% on this.

995
00:48:31.333 --> 00:48:34.166
I mean. what kind of world do we live in?

996
00:48:34.666 --> 00:48:36.333
Where you can get prosecuted

997
00:48:36.416 --> 00:48:38.583
for trying to help those
who need it the most.

998
00:48:38.666 --> 00:48:40.875
-It's all we're doing.
-Hopeful of a good result?

999
00:48:40.958 --> 00:48:43.333
[Dave] If there's any sense in the world.
we are. yeah.

1000
00:48:43.416 --> 00:48:46.291
-Ah. no. We're hopeful.
-We are.

1001
00:48:46.375 --> 00:48:48.250
-It's all you got. innit?
-Yes. it is.

1002
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:51.958
[indistinct]

1003
00:48:55.083 --> 00:48:56.083
Alright.

1004
00:48:57.458 --> 00:48:59.041
[gavel sounds]

1005
00:49:00.375 --> 00:49:04.791
Case 1220. Mr David Fishwick
on a charge of illegal money lending.

1006
00:49:05.333 --> 00:49:07.583
Loan sharking?
Sounds like the kind of thing

1007
00:49:07.666 --> 00:49:10.000
-we should be kicking up to Crown court.
-Hmm.

1008
00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:13.458
[barrister] Your Honour.
despite the seriousness of the charge.

1009
00:49:13.541 --> 00:49:15.875
prosecution will not
be seeking a custodial sentence.

1010
00:49:15.958 --> 00:49:17.541
It can be dealt with here.

1011
00:49:18.041 --> 00:49:20.833
Very well. Mr Fishwick. how do you plead?

1012
00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:22.791
Not guilty. Your Honour.

1013
00:49:23.625 --> 00:49:25.000
Well… Continue.

1014
00:49:25.083 --> 00:49:26.291
[clears throat]

1015
00:49:27.708 --> 00:49:29.208
The documents in front of you

1016
00:49:29.291 --> 00:49:32.875
show that Mr Fishwick.
through his company Fishwick Motors.

1017
00:49:32.958 --> 00:49:38.166
made a loan of £1.100
on October 11th. 2007

1018
00:49:39.083 --> 00:49:41.166
to a Mrs Maureen Clayton for…

1019
00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:43.875
funeral expenses.

1020
00:49:44.666 --> 00:49:48.125
Now. in the second document.
you will see that Fishwick Motors

1021
00:49:48.208 --> 00:49:50.583
is not authorised
to make a loan of that nature.

1022
00:49:51.291 --> 00:49:53.333
[sceptical laugh]
And the charge is loan sharking?

1023
00:49:54.083 --> 00:49:58.458
I am aware that the defendant doesn't fit
the usual image of a loan shark.

1024
00:49:59.125 --> 00:50:03.291
However. the documents in front of you
prove beyond a shadow of a doubt.

1025
00:50:03.375 --> 00:50:05.375
he has engaged in illegal money lending.

1026
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.375
He has broken the law
and must now face the consequences.

1027
00:50:09.458 --> 00:50:10.458
[judge scoffs]

1028
00:50:11.041 --> 00:50:13.500
-Are you representing Mr Fishwick?
-I am. Your Honour.

1029
00:50:13.583 --> 00:50:15.208
Hugh Stockwell. Bentham and Green.

1030
00:50:15.291 --> 00:50:18.291
Do you contest the veracity
of these documents?

1031
00:50:18.375 --> 00:50:19.375
We do not. Your Honour.

1032
00:50:19.458 --> 00:50:23.208
I'm assuming you will be presenting
some kind of defence for your client.

1033
00:50:23.291 --> 00:50:25.958
No. We accept that Mr Fishwick.
on a minor technicality.

1034
00:50:26.041 --> 00:50:27.333
did indeed break the law.

1035
00:50:27.916 --> 00:50:29.208
Well.

1036
00:50:29.291 --> 00:50:30.375
However…

1037
00:50:33.083 --> 00:50:35.708
We are asking that you throw the case out

1038
00:50:35.791 --> 00:50:38.625
on the basis that the complaint.
the charge and the prosecution

1039
00:50:38.708 --> 00:50:40.666
were brought with malicious intent.

1040
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.083
And this malice
is directed towards Mr Fishwick?

1041
00:50:46.166 --> 00:50:49.125
The malice is directed towards
the people of Burnley. Your Honour.

1042
00:50:49.208 --> 00:50:50.333
[judge] Well…

1043
00:50:50.416 --> 00:50:52.833
All three of us on the bench
are residents to Burnley.

1044
00:50:52.916 --> 00:50:54.791
Are you saying the malice
is directed towards us?

1045
00:50:54.875 --> 00:50:56.625
Yes. it most certainly is.

1046
00:50:56.708 --> 00:50:59.875
You're being used to enforce
a corrupt scheme by convicting my client.

1047
00:51:00.458 --> 00:51:04.791
I don't think we need to waste our time
listening to wild conspiracy theories.

1048
00:51:04.875 --> 00:51:07.208
No. of course not. Your Honour.
Of course not.

1049
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.791
You may have noticed there's a great deal
of press interest in this case.

1050
00:51:12.375 --> 00:51:14.625
They're looking for a story.
Ideally a simple one.

1051
00:51:14.708 --> 00:51:17.125
where there's good guys and bad guys.

1052
00:51:20.166 --> 00:51:22.916
I'd urge you to listen
to the evidence we have

1053
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.875
before deciding which side you're on.

1054
00:51:28.041 --> 00:51:29.000
[clears throat]

1055
00:51:32.083 --> 00:51:37.000
We will hear this case. but Mr Stockwell.
I urge you to be brief.

1056
00:51:37.083 --> 00:51:40.333
This is not the Old Bailey and
this is not the time for grandstanding.

1057
00:51:40.416 --> 00:51:42.291
Yes. I understand. Your Honour.

1058
00:51:42.375 --> 00:51:44.875
But while this
might not be the Old Bailey.

1059
00:51:45.375 --> 00:51:47.541
the justice meted out here
is no less important

1060
00:51:47.625 --> 00:51:49.333
and no less worthy of our respect.

1061
00:51:49.416 --> 00:51:51.416
-Too bloody right.
-[scattered laughs]

1062
00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:52.458
Sorry.

1063
00:51:53.416 --> 00:51:54.458
[indistinct]

1064
00:51:56.291 --> 00:51:58.875
I'd like to call Maureen Clayton
to the witness box.

1065
00:52:02.083 --> 00:52:04.458
Dave said he were happy
to pay for everything.

1066
00:52:05.833 --> 00:52:09.041
But in my whole life.
I've never taken a handout.

1067
00:52:09.916 --> 00:52:11.291
I've never taken charity.

1068
00:52:12.458 --> 00:52:13.958
It's just not me.

1069
00:52:14.708 --> 00:52:17.000
I'm the one who said it had to be a loan.

1070
00:52:17.583 --> 00:52:18.958
It had to be official.

1071
00:52:21.208 --> 00:52:24.958
[sobs] There wasn't a single day
that Ron and I weren't together.

1072
00:52:27.875 --> 00:52:28.916
And suddenly.

1073
00:52:30.083 --> 00:52:31.333
he were gone.

1074
00:52:31.958 --> 00:52:33.250
And I were all alone.

1075
00:52:37.291 --> 00:52:40.916
My mind is a total blank
about those first few days.

1076
00:52:41.583 --> 00:52:43.625
I must have been in a right state.

1077
00:52:46.416 --> 00:52:48.375
It were only… [exhales]

1078
00:52:48.458 --> 00:52:52.000
…after the funeral
that I started to come out of it.

1079
00:52:55.125 --> 00:52:56.750
And it weren't just Dave.

1080
00:52:56.833 --> 00:53:00.416
Friends. neighbours.
folk I hadn't seen for years.

1081
00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:03.500
They just popped by
and told me they were there for me.

1082
00:53:06.041 --> 00:53:10.666
It were the only thing
that got me through those days and nights.

1083
00:53:12.916 --> 00:53:15.250
And the loan from Dave
covered the funeral?

1084
00:53:17.958 --> 00:53:19.000
And you paid him back?

1085
00:53:19.083 --> 00:53:20.208
Every penny.

1086
00:53:21.958 --> 00:53:26.541
I gave Dave the money and he gave it
straight to the homeless shelter.

1087
00:53:26.625 --> 00:53:30.041
Those poor people really do need charity.

1088
00:53:32.583 --> 00:53:33.708
Thank you. Maureen.

1089
00:53:33.791 --> 00:53:35.833
[clears throat]
Your Honour. I think it's clear

1090
00:53:35.916 --> 00:53:38.541
that the charge
of loan sharking is absurd.

1091
00:53:38.625 --> 00:53:41.083
My client only had the best intentions

1092
00:53:41.166 --> 00:53:43.458
and the charge hinges
on a minor clerical error.

1093
00:53:45.958 --> 00:53:47.125
I should point out

1094
00:53:47.208 --> 00:53:50.250
these charges were not brought
by the local Burnley police.

1095
00:53:50.833 --> 00:53:54.416
A team was sent all the way from London
to make the arrest.

1096
00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:55.791
Why all that time and effort

1097
00:53:55.875 --> 00:53:58.583
for a crime that doesn't even
merit a county court hearing?

1098
00:53:58.666 --> 00:54:01.583
Well… your answer is here.

1099
00:54:02.416 --> 00:54:03.791
Over the last year and a half.

1100
00:54:03.875 --> 00:54:08.166
Dave Fishwick has made
almost 200 perfectly legal loans

1101
00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:10.166
to individuals and businesses in Burnley.

1102
00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:13.375
These loans have created 150 jobs.

1103
00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:15.875
Here are the documents.

1104
00:54:16.416 --> 00:54:21.791
But now. my client wishes to expand in
order to help more businesses in Burnley.

1105
00:54:21.875 --> 00:54:25.000
But in order to do that. he needs
to be able to take deposits

1106
00:54:25.083 --> 00:54:27.041
so that he can reinvest that money.

1107
00:54:27.125 --> 00:54:28.958
So. a fortnight ago.

1108
00:54:29.041 --> 00:54:32.375
I submitted documentation
to the Financial Regulations Board

1109
00:54:32.458 --> 00:54:34.416
to get him the necessary accreditation.

1110
00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:39.208
And all of this
is to stop him getting that accreditation.

1111
00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:43.000
-Why?
-So they can preserve their monopoly.

1112
00:54:43.083 --> 00:54:47.208
But why all this? Don't they have their
own evaluation procedures in London?

1113
00:54:47.291 --> 00:54:48.875
They do. Your Honour. yes. they do.

1114
00:54:48.958 --> 00:54:52.250
But I suspect they'd rather
you do their dirty work for them.

1115
00:54:52.333 --> 00:54:54.791
You can disqualify my client
in an instant.

1116
00:54:54.875 --> 00:54:57.583
I also suspect
they'd like to avoid media scrutiny.

1117
00:54:57.666 --> 00:54:59.666
Their image is already badly tarnished.

1118
00:54:59.750 --> 00:55:02.750
and this way. they're not the bad guys.

1119
00:55:03.375 --> 00:55:04.500
Who is?

1120
00:55:06.333 --> 00:55:07.291
You are.

1121
00:55:12.250 --> 00:55:13.125
[sighs]

1122
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.625
We need to look at these documents.

1123
00:55:16.125 --> 00:55:18.166
We'll recess for lunch.

1124
00:55:18.250 --> 00:55:21.166
-Reconvene at 2 p.m.
-[gavel slams]

1125
00:55:24.625 --> 00:55:25.750
-Hey.
-[Alexandra] Hey.

1126
00:55:26.291 --> 00:55:28.250
-You're doing alright in there.
-Thank you.

1127
00:55:28.750 --> 00:55:32.250
Not quite Tom Cruise
in <i>A Few Good Men</i> levels. but…

1128
00:55:32.333 --> 00:55:34.541
-Getting there.
-Yes. I think there's elements.

1129
00:55:34.625 --> 00:55:36.791
-There's definitely elements.
-Thank you.

1130
00:55:36.875 --> 00:55:37.958
Em…

1131
00:55:38.041 --> 00:55:40.666
My contact in Bolton Police is here
and she got a name.

1132
00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:43.166
-Yeah?
-Sir Charles Denbigh?

1133
00:55:44.250 --> 00:55:45.583
No. you're kidding me.

1134
00:55:46.791 --> 00:55:48.750
-Yeah.
-Oh. God. That piece of…

1135
00:55:48.833 --> 00:55:52.083
I met him. but I didn't give him
enough information to start all this.

1136
00:55:54.041 --> 00:55:55.291
I… I don't understand.

1137
00:55:58.416 --> 00:55:59.625
Have you got a plan?

1138
00:56:00.708 --> 00:56:01.708
Yeah. maybe.

1139
00:56:02.416 --> 00:56:03.250
-Why?
-You…

1140
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.625
-You're doing that brow furrowing thing.
-Am I?

1141
00:56:06.708 --> 00:56:08.250
Okay. sorry. I don't know what--

1142
00:56:08.333 --> 00:56:11.833
Don't apologise. It's… it's sweet.
it's. em… [clears throat]

1143
00:56:11.916 --> 00:56:13.250
-Em. so…
-Wha--

1144
00:56:13.333 --> 00:56:15.416
-Sweet?
-[giggles] What's the plan?

1145
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:20.916
[gavel slams]

1146
00:56:21.583 --> 00:56:24.666
[male judge] Let's continue.
Mr Stockwell. Mr Fishwick.

1147
00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:27.250
All of this is very impressive.

1148
00:56:28.083 --> 00:56:32.416
You are to be congratulated. Mr Fishwick.
for all you have done for our community.

1149
00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:36.208
Whilst there is no question
that the law has indeed been broken.

1150
00:56:36.708 --> 00:56:41.541
your argument that the prosecution
was malicious is compelling.

1151
00:56:42.416 --> 00:56:43.375
However.

1152
00:56:43.916 --> 00:56:48.625
in order for us to throw this case out.
we need proof beyond reasonable doubt

1153
00:56:48.708 --> 00:56:51.833
that the banks were indeed behind it.

1154
00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:55.000
Do you have this proof?

1155
00:56:55.083 --> 00:56:56.041
I do not.

1156
00:56:57.875 --> 00:57:00.666
-In which case. unfortunately--
-[Hugh] But…

1157
00:57:01.416 --> 00:57:04.833
Perhaps the prosecution
has what you're looking for.

1158
00:57:05.958 --> 00:57:06.916
[barrister] Excuse me?

1159
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.125
When you were given this case.
surely the police gave you the details

1160
00:57:10.208 --> 00:57:13.375
about where the complaint originated.
That's standard procedure.

1161
00:57:13.458 --> 00:57:16.708
Well. in this case. no.
I don't have those details.

1162
00:57:17.875 --> 00:57:19.541
-You don't?
-No.

1163
00:57:21.375 --> 00:57:22.708
Seems odd.

1164
00:57:23.916 --> 00:57:26.291
Okay. so let me get this clear.

1165
00:57:27.583 --> 00:57:29.375
-An anonymous tip.
-[scoffs]

1166
00:57:29.458 --> 00:57:33.083
The kind that causes a team
to be sent all the way from London

1167
00:57:33.166 --> 00:57:36.000
to arrest someone
for filling out the wrong form.

1168
00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:37.666
I have no idea.

1169
00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:42.458
-I have no idea what you want from me.
-I'd like the truth. if possible.

1170
00:57:42.541 --> 00:57:45.958
Your Honour. this is outrageous.
I'm not on trial here.

1171
00:57:46.041 --> 00:57:49.041
Perhaps you should be.
This is a court of law. sir.

1172
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:51.750
If you lie in here. it's called perjury.

1173
00:57:51.833 --> 00:57:54.208
-Mr Stockwell.
-Apologies. Your Honour.

1174
00:57:58.583 --> 00:58:00.666
Very well. As my next witness.

1175
00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:03.583
I'd like to call a senior officer

-I'm in a meeting.
-She stole from me.

1512
01:16:55.541 --> 01:16:57.958
You two can leave.
We'll finish this on Monday morning.

1513
01:16:58.041 --> 01:16:59.333
Not going to admit to it?

1514
01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:01.708
Why should I?

1515
01:17:02.208 --> 01:17:05.500
-I saw an opportunity and I took it.
-An opportunity for what?

1516
01:17:05.583 --> 01:17:07.041
I was in a bad way. remember?

1517
01:17:07.541 --> 01:17:09.416
I thought I was going to lose my job.

1518
01:17:10.291 --> 01:17:11.583
Instead. I got a promotion.

1519
01:17:11.666 --> 01:17:15.250
Did it not occur to you. you might be
putting people's livelihoods at risk?

1520
01:17:15.333 --> 01:17:18.291
Oh. please. Since when were you
the bleeding heart liberal?

1521
01:17:18.916 --> 01:17:21.333
You gave me the idea
to go to Sir Charles Denbigh

1522
01:17:21.416 --> 01:17:23.125
when you mentioned him at dinner.

1523
01:17:23.208 --> 01:17:26.416
-And you've not done too badly out of it.

1524
01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:29.416
How do you think you got such
a high-paying gig at Neo Clarity?

1525
01:17:30.041 --> 01:17:31.416
-You tell me.

1527

He and Sir Charles

1529

[Dave] Hiya.

1549
01:19:21.166 --> 01:19:24.708
For the last few months.
I've known that Maureen was sick.

1550
01:19:26.791 --> 01:19:30.500
But I only found out by accident
that she had cancer.

1551
01:19:32.583 --> 01:19:33.875
She didn't tell anybody.

1552
01:19:35.041 --> 01:19:37.750
'Cause she. uh…
Well. she didn't want pity.

1553
01:19:39.791 --> 01:19:42.291
She were a fighter right to the very end.

1554
01:19:45.583 --> 01:19:48.666
Maureen were a nurse for 25 years.

1555
01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:53.666
It's hard to imagine
how many people she helped.

1556
01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:56.125
How many lives she touched in that time.

1557
01:19:57.708 --> 01:20:01.208
When we think of a…
a pillar of the community.

1558
01:20:01.291 --> 01:20:05.291
we… we tend to think
of someone rich and powerful.

1559
01:20:06.291 --> 01:20:07.375
like a politician.

1560
01:20:08.875 --> 01:20:09.958

It's ordinary people
who aren't after status or fame or money.

1564

they're the ones
who define who we are as a community.

She were a real pillar of the community.

1568
01:20:45.333 --> 01:20:48.166
From the day she arrived.
we were a richer place.

1569
01:20:50.166 --> 01:20:51.875
And with her passing we're poorer.

1570
01:20:55.791 --> 01:20:56.750

this idea of yours all night.

01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:11.250
Sorry.

1638
01:25:11.333 --> 01:25:13.708
It's not going to make us enough money.

1639
01:25:15.083 --> 01:25:19.375
Even if we charge folk 30. 40. 50 quid.
still doesn't add up.

1640
01:25:20.625 --> 01:25:21.875
So here's my idea.

1641
01:25:22.958 --> 01:25:26.083
You can buy a ticket for. say. 35 quid.

1642
01:25:26.166 --> 01:25:30.708
or you can put 100 quid
on deposit at Bank of Dave.

1643
01:25:31.875 --> 01:25:34.333
In six months. you take it out.
plus interest.

1644
01:25:34.416 --> 01:25:38.000
-So you saw the concert for free.
-If Bank of Dave doesn't happen?

1645
01:25:38.083 --> 01:25:39.583
Then you get your 100 quid back.

1646
01:25:40.208 --> 01:25:41.458
The concert's still free.

1647
01:25:42.875 --> 01:25:43.750
Eh?

Yeah. That's why we need the clinic.

It's partly why I'm here. actually.

-No. Yeah. of course.

1664
