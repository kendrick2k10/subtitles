Is that pillow OK for you?

6
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.920
Yeah.

7
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.880
Hello. little one.

8
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.560
Do you know who I am?

9
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.920
I'm your big brother. Leon.

10
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.000
I'm ten years old.

11
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.280
You're REALLY small.

12
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.600
Can I take him back? There we go.

13
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.200
You need to feed him. Yeah.

14
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.040
Tina. get that for me?

15
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.960
Give me a sec.

16
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.520
Thank you.

17
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.440
Thank you.

18
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.560
Hello. precious.

19
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.920
There we are. baby.

20
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.360
Dear Jake. It was special
when you were born.

21
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.640
You were really sleepy.

22
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.560
But when I looked at you.

23
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.520
you made me feel really fuzzy.

24
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.200
I couldn't stop looking at you.

25
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.560
You were like...television.

26
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.240
I always knew what you wanted
when you were crying.

27
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.080
and you cried a LOT.

28
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.320
I didn't mind. even when you woke me
up in the middle of the night.

29
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.320
You're the smelliest captain ever!

30
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.480
Theme from
The New Avengers

31
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.880
You started laughing when we watched
The New Avengers.

32
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.400
And I knew that we would always like
the same things.

33
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.560
Do you remember watching it
with Mum?

34
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.200
You probably don't know. but
Mum is beautiful.

35
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.880
Everyone says so.

36
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.760
You look like her.

37
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.840
Where you going?

38
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.280
I've just got to nip out.

39
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.320
I won't be long.

40
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.240
Love you.

41
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.560
We're going to make a story
for Mum. Good idea?

42
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.480
A rescue story.

43
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.800
We're going to rescue my dad
from the big house with guards.

44
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.560
Lieutenant Bridge and
Sergeant Smith will help.

45
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.160
Lieutenant Bridge. Sergeant Smith.

46
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.560
do you promise to listen
to Captain Jake's orders?

47
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.640
I always imagine what it will be
like when you're older.

48
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.720
And we can play soldiers and
football together.

49
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.800
Can you tell me a story?

50
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.760
I'm really tired.

51
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.720
Maybe another night?

52
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.360
Can you sing a song?

53
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.720
You're always happier
when you sing.

54
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.480
All right. then.

55
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.000
Come on. then.

56
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.400
Any requests?

57
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.160
Um...

58
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.280
The one you and Dad used to sing.

59
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.960
# Mother. mother

60
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.080
# There's too many of you crying

61
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.640
# Brother. brother. brother

62
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.400
# There's far too many of you dying

63
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.880
# You know we've got to find a way

64
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.480
# To bring some loving here today

65
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.000
# Yeah! #

66
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.240
My baby.

67
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.360
All right. come on.
Bed now. School tomorrow. Yeah.

68
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.120
You're going to be much cleverer
than Mummy.

69
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.880
How many times? I have got

70
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.240
a family. I ain't looking for a new
one. But he's yours.

71
00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.120
you haven't even seen him...
He's not mine.

72
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.640
Get it out your silly little head.

73
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.320
You said you were going to move in.
we were going to be a proper family.

74
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.320
I've got a wife and kids -
why would I move in here?

75
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.440
You were lying to me all this time.

76
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.160
I'm not paying for a baby that's not
mine. He's yours!

77
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.320
I can't do it on me own!
Leave it out.

78
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.920
Why won't you even see him?
I don't want to see him!

79
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.480
No...

80
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.640
It's OK.

81
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.080
Back on duty. Don't move.

82
00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.040
Nyee-ow! Nyee-ow!

83
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.560
Morning. Mum. Nyee-ow!

84
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.360
Mum? It's time for breakfast.

85
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.960
Good morning? Mum!

86
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.920
What did you say? Mum.

87
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.000
Jake's crying.
It's time for breakfast. Mum!

88
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.040
We've got to get to work.
Mummy's tired.

89
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.280
Nyee-ow.

90
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.040
# ..and when they were down
They were down

91
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.040
# And when they were only halfway up

92
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.800
# They were neither up nor down. #

93
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.720
Mum... Mum!

94
00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.360
I'm hungry. Mum!

95
00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.320
Mum! I'm hungry!

96
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:14.280
Ugh. Jake. you stink.

97
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:34.320
Here's Lieutenant Bridge
to protect you.

98
00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.240
Hopefully. Mum will wake up soon.

99
00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.560
You look out for Captain Jake and
Mum.

100
00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.520
Don't let anything happen.

101
00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.240
I won't be long. I promise.

102
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.080
I was wondering...
My mum needs some money.

103
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.520
Again? How is she? Fine.

104
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.240
Are you sure?

105
00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.320
She's fine.

106
00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.560
Where is she?

107
00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.280
Carol? Carol?

108
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.840
How long has she been like this?

109
00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.560
Carol?

110
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.280
Carol? Carol?

111
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.520
Tell me about
your relationship with Carol?

112
00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.840
She's my best friend.
I've known here for years.

113
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.640
She's a good person.
I should have seen it.

114
00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.960
I kept telling her
to go to the doctor.

115
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.600
but he just kept giving her
more pills.

116
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.480
How well do you know the children?

117
00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.400
It's all right. sweetie.

118
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.360
I was there when they were born...
OK.

119
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.720
Come on. Leon.

120
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.000
You're OK. Jake.

121
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.280
We're OK.

122
00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.080
Come this way. darling.

123
00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.280
Come on.

124
00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.800
Jake!

125
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.280
This is my last time
helping you lot out.

126
00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.640
I said I was retiring.

127
00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.400
We're struggling to place
them. Why?

128
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:03.080
You know why.
Anything I should know about?

129
00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:06.520
He's just like the rest.
been through quite an ordeal.

130
00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.080
Looking after the baby
all by himself.

131
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.480
Don't know how the hell he's coped.
His mum's in a bad way.

132
00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.520
Bacon sarnie with red sauce.
All you can eat.

133
00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.320
Can you take me to see my mum today?

134
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.920
Not today. love. She needs
some time to get strong again.

135
00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:40.240
Come to the table.
I'll pour you a drink.

136
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.000
You put yourself over there.

137
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.920
I'll come and visit soon.

138
00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.760
You need to get something sorted.

139
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.200
You want another one?

140
00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.200
Hello. Hello. Mr Man!

141
00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:12.400
Are you coming here? Are you going
to come up? Are you?

142
00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.480
Aww. You've got a lovely brother!

143
00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.360
Hello!

144
00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.400
I expect some people can't see
the resemblance. but I can.

145
00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.960
Let me guess. You're the quiet one?

146
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:39.320
And he's the boss?
He's the captain. Oh. I see.

147
00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.120
You've been taking good care of him.

148
00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.320
Can you help me.
so I can do the same?

149
00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.920
You OK?

150
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.040
Do you want to play a game?

151
00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.920
How long will we be here for?

152
00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:21.200
Just till your mummy's better.
Will I have to change school?

153
00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.120
I hope not. love.

154
00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.880
So. no games. Do you like stories?

155
00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:33.920
I'm not the biggest fan of wizards
and sorcerers. I like real ones.

156
00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:38.400
Like memories or special moments.
I bet you have a few of those.

157
00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.760
Why don't you tell me one?

158
00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.160
Something special you remember.

159
00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.840
Something that gives you
a warm feeling inside.

160
00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:59.480
I'm making some hot chocolate.
Come down if you want some.

161
00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.360
"Dear Mum. Maureen said to try
and write a letter to keep you

162
00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:20.360
"up to date. cos I told her
how much I'm missing you."

163
00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:26.320
Not too tight. Don't do too tight?
He needs to be able to move around.

164
00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.880
"She ain't pretty like you. and she
can't sing like you. either."

165
00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.360
"But we eat really good."

166
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.440
Can I give you a hug
to say thank you?

167
00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:44.320
"She's nice to me and Jake.
but it isn't the same."

168
00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.200
"When are you coming to get us. Mum?

169
00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.120
"Jake's getting so big.
but you're missing it.

170
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.960
"You're missing it all."

171
00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.760
It's for the best.
They're siblings.

172
00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:14.200
You know how the system works.
When? After Christmas.

173
00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.480
When she comes round. we look sad.

174
00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:22.280
I'm sorry.
It's going to break his heart.

175
00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:31.000
What does "siblings" mean? Oh. love.
Does it mean you think I'm bad?

176
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:36.280
I think you are the bravest little
sibling in the whole wide world.

177
00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.520
Jake is very lucky to have
a brother like you.

178
00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.960
Look at the tank!

179
00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:00.160
We need something to fly.
so we can chase the big dragon!

180
00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.640
We need this thing. don't we?
Is this any good?

181
00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.360
Yeah. The big dragon's over here!

182
00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.840
Finally! Killed him.

183
00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.280
I'm glad. I'm exhausted.
Sergeant Smith is too.

184
00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.560
There's only three more sleeps
till Christmas.

185
00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:45.160
Are you excited about the gifts
Father Christmas is going to

186
00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.600
bring you both?

187
00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.840
No. Why not? Cos he's not real.

188
00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.720
It's always your mum
and dad who buy the presents.

189
00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.520
I don't care.
Don't want any presents anyway.

190
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.400
Oh. well. it makes sense you'd
work that out. smarty pants.

191
00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.880
What should we tell Jake. then?

192
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:06.240
The truth. that Father Christmas
doesn't exist? No.

193
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.760
I got him a present
with my own pocket money.

194
00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.000
It's his only one.
since my mum won't be here.

195
00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.720
Well. I might have bought
a gift for Jake too.

196
00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.520
I suppose we'll just have to wait
and see. won't we?

197
00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:31.280
# So here it is. Merry Christmas

198
00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:34.800
# Everybody's having fun

199
00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:39.320
# Look to the future now

200
00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.800
# It's only just begun! #

201
00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.200
Are you both ready?

202
00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.360
Now. Jake. this one is from Leon.

203
00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:53.080
Shall I help you open it?
Yeah. help him open it. go on.

204
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.280
Go on. rip it open.

205
00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.240
Merry Christmas. Jake!

206
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:11.080
And this one is from Jake to you.

207
00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.000
Well. don't keep him waiting!

208
00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:31.280
Who's that? That should be Mrs Santa
Claus with more gifts for you!

209
00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.760
Coming!

210
00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:45.680
Ah. how're you doing. love?
Oh. really good.

211
00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.080
How was the ride here?
It was terrible.

212
00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.320
It's colder than a penguin's
arse out there.

213
00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.160
I could murder a coffee.

214
00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.440
Let me introduce you
to the kids first.

215
00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:00.600
Where are their presents?
Oh. yeah. About that.

216
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.160
What? You plum. it's Christmas!

217
00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.200
I was holding them in my hand.
and I put them down for five seconds

218
00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.360
to put my make-up on. and then I
was halfway here before I realised.

219
00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:12.640
But the kids! It's all right.
I'll make it up.

220
00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.600
Oh!

221
00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.720
Who's this cute little monkey?
Mm?

222
00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.240
I mean. who's this cute little bear?

223
00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.600
Because we like bears. don't we?

224
00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.640
And any other animal in the jungle.

225
00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:32.000
Not that you're from the jungle.
Look at you. you're so cute!

226
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.600
He's not three. Sylvie. Sorry. pup.

227
00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:39.000
Me sister. she's nothing like me.
kids aren't her thing.

228
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.760
But she's lovely once you've known
her over 50 years!

229
00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.920
What happened to leaving
all this behind?

230
00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.400
Living in Hastings.
laying on a beach all day?

231
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.880
# Bring me sunshine... #

232
00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.560
It ain't changed any of us...
Cheeky bleeders.

233
00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:10.160
They've taken 20 years of your life.
They couldn't find anyone to take
him.

234
00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:14.360
Shame. because he's a good kid.
You're too soft.

235
00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.600
You should save yourself the
heartache.

236
00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.040
He'll soon get adopted.

237
00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.800
Maureen...

238
00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.720
This isn't doing you any good.

239
00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.320
He's the last one.

240
00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.960
Y'all right. love?

241
00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.840
# Bring me sunshine.
bring me lo-o-o-ove!

242
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.480
# Bring me sunshine... #

243
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.240
Why do you think
her hair is like that?

244
00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.920
And her nails are so red.

245
00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.000
She's a witch.

246
00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:04.120
Shhh! She might put a spell on us
if we're too loud.

247
00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.160
Here we go...

248
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:17.920
Oh. will you relax? There's
enough food here to feed an army.

249
00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:23.400
Stop fussing. Just stick it in your
mouth and be quiet. Hello. bab.

250
00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.120
Oh...

251
00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.120
# Bring me sunshine... #

252
00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.480
Anything happens to her.

253
00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:36.760
you'll be sorry.

254
00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:38.600
# Bring me sunshine

255
00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:45.000
# Bring me lo-o-o-o-ove! #

256
00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.960
Leon. love. it's time for dinner.

257
00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:01.000
Come away from the window. pigeon.

258
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.600
All right. coming.

259
00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:09.320
Jake's still a very young baby.
Leon.

260
00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.440
and he needs to be with a family
that can look after him properly.

261
00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.160
Isn't that right. Maureen?

262
00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:17.920
He is with a family and
we do look after him properly.

263
00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.440
We know how much you care about him.

264
00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.280
Wouldn't you like to see him happy?

265
00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.120
Forever. I mean?

266
00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:30.480
That's what we want too.
We want the best for everyone.

267
00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.240
You've been through so much.

268
00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.840
Taking care of your mum
and your little brother.

269
00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.800
You did a brilliant job.

270
00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.280
A job you should never have
had to do.

271
00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.320
And this is a very hard decision
we've had to make.

272
00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.960
What are you talking about?

273
00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.680
He'll understand.

274
00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.400
Leon...

275
00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.640
..you and Jake won't
be living together.

276
00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.440
But he will be able to write to you.

277
00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.160
Jake can't read or write.

278
00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.400
Leon. love. go grab a Curly Wurly.

279
00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.680
Really?!

280
00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.240
Yeah.

281
00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.400
I'll take it from here.

282
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.040
I'm sorry.

283
00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.040
They believe it's for the best.

284
00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.000
What was she talking about?
Come here. Leon.

285
00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.280
What Salma was trying to say...

286
00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.800
..is that Jake's going
to be adopted.

287
00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:44.120
What's that mean?

288
00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.280
That he'll go and live
with a new family.

289
00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:51.000
And you won't see him again.

290
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.520
Never? Not for a long time.

291
00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.400
Why can't I go with him?

292
00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:04.640
Yeah...

293
00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.160
No need to cry...

294
00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.680
Boop.

295
00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.080
You want it?

296
00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:20.120
Yeah...

297
00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:24.160
Oh. no. It's OK.

298
00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.760
Why are we walking the long way?

299
00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:12.280
The other day. when you were at
school. Jake had some visitors.

300
00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:14.960
A man and a woman.

301
00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.480
They've come back today.
to come and...

302
00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.360
Leon!

303
00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.960
Shall we go and say goodbye?

304
00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.320
Hello. Leon.

305
00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.560
He'll keep you safe
until I get you back.

306
00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.360
I'll keep it for him.

307
00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.120
Ba.

308
00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:38.400
Leon. if you want Lieutenant Bridge
to look after him.

309
00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.040
give him to the lady.

310
00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:41.640
Or you keep him yourself.

311
00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.600
Good boy.

312
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.160
Leon.

313
00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.880
Leon! Leave me alone!

314
00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.360
You're getting so tall!

315
00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.920
It's a bit chilly. isn't it?

316
00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.400
Why don't we go back inside
and get a Curly Wurly?

317
00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.440
I've got some good news.

318
00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.560
Come down as soon as you're ready.

319
00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:25.800
Wait.

320
00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.160
Mum! Hello. my baby.

321
00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.800
Oh. look at you!

322
00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.760
You all right? Yeah?

323
00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:43.880
I've got something for you.

324
00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.480
It's for school.

325
00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.640
Do you like 'em?

326
00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:55.800
Thanks. I love them.

327
00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.400
He's been doing really well.

328
00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.200
I can see.

329
00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.000
Missed you.

330
00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:40.840
Couldn't wait to see you.

331
00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.240
You want to come up to my room. Mum?

332
00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.120
Aw. this is nice.

333
00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:57.000
These are some weird things that
Maureen has all around the house.

334
00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.200
And in the hallway.

335
00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.400
Ooh. look at this train!

336
00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:05.200
These are cars. they're so cool
and fun to play with.

337
00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.200
Radio for music...

338
00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.320
That's bingo. that's cool fun.

339
00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.600
We're taking it with us.

340
00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:27.920
Where are we going?

341
00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.120
Home. so we can get Jake back.

342
00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:36.240
What's wrong?

343
00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:39.440
I can't. Why?

344
00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.360
Because I can't. it's too late...

345
00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.200
We can get him back. together.
I can help you.

346
00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:46.000
They won't listen.

347
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.280
Nobody listens. Nobody listens.

348
00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:51.360
I'll talk to Social Services.
Maureen will help us!

349
00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:57.400
What's happened? Mum!

350
00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:00.920
She's got to help me get him back!
Just take a moment.

351
00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.680
Please. tell her.
She's got to help me... Come here.

352
00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:06.040
She's got to help me.

353
00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:09.000
Mum!

354
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.800
Just take a deep breath. That's it.

355
00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:28.360
No more ugly social workers
messing things up for me.

356
00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.680
I'm going to find Jake on my own.
if I have to.

357
00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:55.000
Maureen?

358
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.640
Maureen!

359
00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:57.960
Get up.

360
00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.200
Maureen.

361
00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.560
Maureen. get up. Please!

362
00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:35.240
How is she? Can I see her?
Not yet.

363
00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:38.520
What happened?

364
00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:41.560
Doctors aren't sure.
but Leon found her in good time.

365
00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:43.040
saved her life. in fact.

366
00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.680
Oh.

367
00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.360
You are a good boy.

368
00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:23.840
You're a brave boy. What you did...

369
00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:27.400
Maureen needs to stay in hospital
a bit longer.

370
00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:30.720
I promise. as soon as I get an
update. you can go and visit.

371
00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:33.480
We all want to see Maureen back. Le.

372
00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.280
Where's Jake?

373
00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.680
I can't say.

374
00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.800
When can I see him?

375
00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.280
I want to see him.

376
00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:47.720
I've got a little present for you.

377
00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:49.120
Come.

378
00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.560
It's yours.

379
00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:06.640
This isn't Jake.
Yeah. I know.

380
00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:08.160
You know how to ride a bike?

381
00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.000
You lucky boy.

382
00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:20.600
Why don't you take it for a spin?

383
00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:29.240
Careful. don't go too far!

384
00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:43.560
Hey.

385
00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:45.040
You all right?

386
00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.280
Le.

387
00:39:56.280 --> 00:40:00.360
What did I tell you about
cleaning up after your dinner?

388
00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:02.720
I'll do it later.
No. Le. now.

389
00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.160
Maureen never made me.

390
00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.080
Newsflash. I'm not Maureen.

391
00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.680
She gave me pocket money too.

392
00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.240
Do I look like a mug?

393
00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:21.000
We can't stay here for long.

394
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.360
We need to start our mission
to rescue Jake.

395
00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:27.440
We're going to need some survival
stuff - food and drink

396
00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:29.320
and money.

397
00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:30.880
Shall I take one or two?

398
00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.440
Le!

399
00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:37.680
Who you talking to?
Sergeant Smith.

400
00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:40.560
Morning. Desree.

401
00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:44.440
You all right?
Yeah. man. Good.

402
00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:48.520
Hello.

403
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.280
Yes. Norris.

404
00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.200
Yo.

405
00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:12.760
You lost or something?

406
00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:14.680
We both have bikes...

407
00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:16.000
Yeah. me can see that.

408
00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:18.800
Yours is really fast.

409
00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:23.440
Yours looks like it could go pretty
fast too. It's a cool bike.

410
00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:26.120
You're a bit too big for it. though.

411
00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:27.360
Come.

412
00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:42.880
Try it now.

413
00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.760
Let me see.

414
00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:45.920
Mm.

415
00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:55.000
What do you do round here?

416
00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.600
It's an allotment.

417
00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:59.880
So. we grow things - plants. fruit.

418
00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:01.400
Can I see?

419
00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:02.800
What's your name. big man?

420
00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.080
Leon.

421
00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:10.960
That's how we do things around here.
All right?

422
00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:13.680
And it's Tufty.

423
00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:15.400
What's a tufty?

424
00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:16.720
That's my name.

425
00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:24.920
Look. I'll show you around.
but only for a minute. Right?

426
00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:36.960
Take a look around.
see what you see.

427
00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.360
Yo. Mind what you're touching.
you know.

428
00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:05.880
See the plant there?

429
00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:07.240
That one there's tomato.

430
00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:10.600
Then we have the garlic.

431
00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:13.200
I don't really like it
but it grow good.

432
00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.840
And they're runner beans. them.

433
00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:22.680
Yo. big man. Touch that.
tell me what you feel.

434
00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:27.680
Dirt.

435
00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:29.560
No. sir.

436
00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:31.560
This is much more than dirt. right?

437
00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:34.800
This is land.

438
00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:39.680
It might not make sense now. but...

439
00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:42.520
..as an elder once told me.

440
00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:45.400
"If you want strong trees.

441
00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:47.080
"you have to plant the seed."

442
00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:48.480
Go on...

443
00:44:58.120 --> 00:44:59.880
Good.

444
00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.640
The sun changes everything. man.

445
00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:04.800
My dad once said.

446
00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:08.000
"You can manage in the sun
what you can't in the rain."

447
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.360
Where is your dad?

448
00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:11.760
Somewhere sunnier.

449
00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:18.360
Come. Time to go. big man.
me have work to do. Go on.

450
00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:19.640
Go on.

451
00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:30.920
Hey. kids aren't allowed in here.

452
00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:32.400
What are you doing?

453
00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:34.800
Yo. Devlin. leave him now.
the boy's with me.

454
00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.520
You know the rules. Mr Burrows.

455
00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:37.920
Look. he's my little brother.

456
00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:39.520
Ha! No. he's not.

457
00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.840
All right. nephew. then.

458
00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:42.520
Why can't you follow the rules?

459
00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:47.280
Isn't there a rule about
being drunk all the damn time?

460
00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:50.880
Come back whenever you want.

461
00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:33.960
"He's my little brother."

462
00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:39.680
"He's my
little brother."

463
00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:47.120
Who gave you them?

464
00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:49.680
Sometimes. you have to
treat yourself. or no-one will.

465
00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:53.640
I'm taking the bike out.
Where to?

466
00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:55.800
The park.
Don't come back too late.

467
00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:57.280
I've got friends coming over.

468
00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:59.880
You've got to have your supper.
and get to bed. Early!

469
00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:10.600
You ever played dominoes before?

470
00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.720
All right.

471
00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.320
Come. Tufty. come.
Watch it now.

472
00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:23.120
What kind of domino is that?

473
00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:24.840
Your daddy would be ashamed.

474
00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:26.360
Mind your business.

475
00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:30.040
Tut-tut. man.

476
00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:34.440
You can't move. can you?

477
00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:37.560
Well...

478
00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:44.720
You're going tonight?

479
00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:46.560
Yep.

480
00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:48.240
How about you?

481
00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:53.240
And what do you think it'll achieve?
Hmm?

482
00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:56.640
You'll run up and down in the
streets shouting. saying your piece.

483
00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.720
catch some hell from the police.

484
00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:00.880
and then tomorrow you'll be in
the same place.

485
00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:03.000
I don't want to hear that.

486
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.840
If you can't see why we're doing it.

487
00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:08.240
then you stay comfy under 'dem
Babylon boot.

488
00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:14.240
You youngsters. you think
you know it all.

489
00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:17.240
Who do you think got you
your rights in the first place? Huh?

490
00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:19.560
Let me tell you something. son.

491
00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:22.680
before you could wipe your own
backside. I was getting stuff done.

492
00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:24.760
Mr Johnson. he didn't mean it like
that.

493
00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:28.480
Don't put words in my mouth.
That's exactly what I meant.

494
00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:33.160
Gone are the days when we
peacefully march in our Sunday best.

495
00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:36.080
I can't help you if you can't see
what's going on out here.

496
00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:38.600
You want me to sit back
and do nothing? Over my dead body.

497
00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:40.520
Calm down. man.
You don't think I'm angry too?

498
00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:41.800
Then act like it.

499
00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:44.040
Not if it gets you
locked up or killed!

500
00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:46.880
Do I look afraid?

501
00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:02.400
Why do you always have to
take it too far? Was it just me?

502
00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:14.600
There ain't nothing to be afraid of.
you understand?

503
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.320
See you tonight.

504
00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:22.840
Don't let me down.

505
00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:34.360
This thing that's happening tonight.

506
00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:35.720
are you going?

507
00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:43.080
What's it about?

508
00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:48.440
Some brothers were unfairly arrested
by the police.

509
00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:53.240
One of them was beaten pretty bad.

510
00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:55.120
Were they bad guys?

511
00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:56.760
No. they weren't.

512
00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:01.640
Why would the police do that?

513
00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:03.160
Because they don't like us.

514
00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:09.960
Does that mean you agree
with your friend about fighting?

515
00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:12.680
In some ways I do.

516
00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:15.720
When it's absolutely necessary.

517
00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:18.880
But words are always more powerful.

518
00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:23.080
But when do you know it's time
to fight?

519
00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:29.000
When something has happened

520
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.280
that's so terrible...

521
00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:34.640
..and so unfair.

522
00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:36.480
you can't stand back and do nothing.

523
00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:38.960
Like?

524
00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:43.280
Like when you lose someone
you really love.

525
00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:45.480
and your words are not being heard.

526
00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:46.960
And you feel it...

527
00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:49.560
..here

528
00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:51.200
and here.

529
00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:53.600
Then you know.

530
00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.200
See. when I'm here...

531
00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:01.720
..it all goes away.

532
00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:05.400
Work stress.

533
00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:09.560
life stress.
no boss telling me what to do.

534
00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:11.840
Here...

535
00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:15.360
..I'm free.

536
00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:17.840
Here. I'm the king.

537
00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:19.600
Can I be a prince. then?

538
00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:21.320
Yo. man.

539
00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:23.800
Why not? Imagine that.

540
00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:26.800
the black king
and prince of England.

541
00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:32.440
Well. I'm more of a brown colour.
so can I be the brown prince?

542
00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:34.600
Trust me. Star.

543
00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:36.640
people out there.

544
00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:39.520
they see black.
doesn't matter what you think.

545
00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:45.040
You'll understand soon enough. Come.

546
00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:51.720
Careful.
Hiya. love.

547
00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:56.480
Right. I'll go and make myself
a cup of tea. then. shall I?

548
00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:01.520
Oh. thank you.

549
00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:10.960
How are things with Sylvie?

550
00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:12.320
Boring.

551
00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:17.760
You don't belong here.

552
00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:22.280
The doctors just want to be sure
I'm OK. I'll be back on my feet.

553
00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:27.440
I think about Jake all the time.

554
00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:30.080
I know.
I'm going to get him back. you know.

555
00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:32.280
Oh. Leon.
you've got to let that go.

556
00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:33.960
Why did they take him away from me?

557
00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:36.440
We've been through this.

558
00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:38.640
Is it because he's white...

559
00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:41.760
..and I'm not?

560
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:44.480
Where did you hear that?
Is it?

561
00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:47.200
It was for many reasons. love.

562
00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:49.320
It's not unusual
to separate siblings.

563
00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:52.560
He was a baby. and it's easier to
find forever homes for babies.

564
00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:59.280
We've always been honest
with each other.

565
00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:02.000
so I won't lie and say him being
white and you being...

566
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.400
Black. Black.

567
00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:06.240
..doesn't mean anything because
that's not the world we live in.

568
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:08.520
White people think we always
make trouble.

569
00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:10.160
I don't think that.

570
00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:11.640
You're different.

571
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.240
Leon...

572
00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:19.880
..Jake has his own life now.

573
00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:24.800
You've got to move on
and focus on yours.

574
00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:27.040
I am. with Jake.

575
00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:32.960
I'm so sorry I can't be there
for you.

576
00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:37.120
Once I get home.
it'll be different. I promise.

577
00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:44.960
Why don't you go play with
Sergeant Smith for a moment?

578
00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:46.400
Go on.

579
00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:56.880
You need to get him something
from that family.

580
00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:58.600
What do you mean?

581
00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:01.440
Talk to the social worker.
give it to him on his birthday.

582
00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:07.520
You know it's his birthday soon?

583
00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:08.920
Yeah. 'course I know.

584
00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:53.760
I think we've just found our base.

585
00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:56.440
Operation Free Captain Jake.

586
00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:02.160
Rah. Star. why you running
in here like the police?

587
00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:04.520
Can I borrow some seeds?
For what?

588
00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:05.800
To grow stuff?

589
00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:20.400
Do you have a spare lock too?

590
00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:21.760
What for?

591
00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:24.280
To lock something?

592
00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:27.480
Look at me.

593
00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:30.840
Whatever it is.

594
00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:34.000
if Devlin catches you. it wasn't me.
You hear?

595
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.560
All right.

596
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.320
Go on.

597
00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:15.840
Hello.

598
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.440
Try that.

599
00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:23.600
Do you like it?

600
00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:26.680
Don't be shy.
eat as much as you want.

601
00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:31.320
That's Castro. Remember Mr Johnson?

602
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.760
Castro.

603
00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:36.560
Remember little man?

604
00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:38.040
Yeah. man. Good?

605
00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:45.120
Old fool. thinks he runs this place.

606
00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:49.880
My dad has been bringing me here
since way back.

607
00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:53.640
so that man there can't tell me
nothin' about rules.

608
00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:57.000
He's just sad. My mum was sad too.

609
00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.600
Yeah. but your mum's different.

610
00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:01.400
Why do you think grown-ups get sad?

611
00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:05.560
Well...

612
00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:09.560
..eventually you see the real world.

613
00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:11.000
and it's ugly.

614
00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:13.840
What makes you sad?

615
00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:17.840
Beautiful.

616
00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:22.560
Look after it. yeah?

617
00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:29.960
Come.

618
00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:45.920
I have two daughters.

619
00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:49.040
Laila and Alyssa.

620
00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:51.960
Eight and ten.

621
00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:56.000
Me don't get to see them.

622
00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.280
Why not?

623
00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:01.080
They live with my parents.

624
01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:03.000
In Jamaica.

625
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.320
Why?

626
01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:11.240
Their mother...

627
01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:15.880
..their mother died when
they were very young.

628
01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:21.960
I need to work to support them.
give them the best.

629
01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:26.080
My parents helped me raise them.

630
01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:28.800
I miss my little brother too.

631
01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.320
Where is he?

632
01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:34.640
A man and woman took him away.

633
01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:37.440
Why?
Because my mum got sick.

634
01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:38.840
So who looks after you?

635
01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:43.520
First this woman. Maureen.
but then she got sick too.

636
01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:45.040
so now it's her sister.

637
01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:47.880
So. why didn't they take you along
with your little brother?

638
01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:51.160
Because they didn't think we looked
like brothers. What?

639
01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:52.640
Because he's white.

640
01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:57.720
We're going to get them back.
though. right?

641
01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:59.320
Your daughters and my brother?

642
01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:03.200
I'm going to rescue him.

643
01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:06.440
Once I get him back. I can help you
rescue your daughters too.

644
01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.320
Yeah. man.

645
01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:13.640
One day.
we'll all be back together again.

646
01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:17.840
All right.

647
01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:30.200
Leon?

648
01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:37.360
What you up to?
Tidying my room.

649
01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:42.680
You forgot to put
your breakfast stuff away.

650
01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.440
I'll go and do it now.
Wait.

651
01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:50.440
I've got something for you.

652
01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.720
Did you think I'd forget?

653
01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:55.360
Well. close your eyes.

654
01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:01.040
Happy birthday. kiddo.

655
01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:21.880
I'll leave you to it.

656
01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:33.680
"Dear Leon. I know
it's your birthday.

657
01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:36.120
"so I've sent you a photograph of
me.

658
01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:39.080
"I hope you have a special day.
Love. Jake."

659
01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:51.120
Bristol.

660
01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:54.400
He's in Bristol!

661
01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:18.080
Target - Captain Jake.

662
01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:20.160
Location - Bristol.

663
01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:30.280
I thought we were going to be
able to ride there.

664
01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:31.920
I can't cycle that far.

665
01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:43.840
You want to help me with this?

666
01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:50.440
What's on your mind?

667
01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:52.160
I need money.

668
01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:54.160
Oh. How much?

669
01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:59.040
I don't know. however much it costs
to get to Bristol.

670
01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:01.000
What's in Bristol?

671
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.400
My brother.

672
01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:08.720
Why isn't someone taking you there?

673
01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:12.000
They are. it's just I
want to pay my own way.

674
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.560
like a grown-up.

675
01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:17.600
Well. the train'll be quicker.
Bit pricy.

676
01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:22.160
But first you need to get a bus
to the station.

677
01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:24.440
I can cycle to the train station.

678
01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:27.600
You'll also need to get a taxi or
something when you get to Bristol.

679
01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:31.080
I don't think you can get that much
money without doing a bit of work.

680
01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:37.480
So...

681
01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:40.560
..that's it?

682
01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:42.960
Things get hard
and you just give up?

683
01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:47.280
You're going to need
to be tougher than that. Star.

684
01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:51.920
All right. stand up.

685
01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:54.120
Why? I said. stand up.

686
01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:02.480
Come on. loosen up now.

687
01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:06.160
Now. anyone ever show you how to

688
01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:08.880
pick yourself up when you're feeling
sad?

689
01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:10.960
You're going to learn today.

690
01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:13.280
Come. watch me now.

691
01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:15.680
One. two. one. two.

692
01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:17.200
One. two. See that?

693
01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:20.080
One. two. It's all about the rhythm.
Let me see your arms.

694
01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:24.320
Good.

695
01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:25.880
All right. now. follow me.

696
01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:29.120
One. two. one. two...

697
01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:31.240
One. two...

698
01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:35.680
One. two. One. two.
Yeah. man.

699
01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:37.360
One. two. One. two.

700
01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:38.960
Feel good? Yeah.

701
01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:40.880
I can't hear you.
Does it feel good?

702
01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:42.920
Yeah!
Still can't hear you.

703
01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.720
YES!

704
01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:46.520
OK. right. right.

705
01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:49.040
Now. if you can help me around here.

706
01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:51.760
I'll see if I can't give you
a little pocket money. which you

707
01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:56.320
can save up until you have
enough for your trip. Sound good?

708
01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:58.240
All right. now. start.

709
01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:00.120
Me say start. Work.

710
01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:04.520
That's it.

711
01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:08.480
So put the plant in it now.

712
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.800
Watch me.

713
01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:17.040
Watch me now.

714
01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:19.400
You idiot! Come.

715
01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:21.800
Right. take one of these.

716
01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:23.440
See it now?

717
01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:25.960
One. two. One. two.
One. two. One. two.

718
01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:28.880
One. two. One. two. One. two.
One. two.

719
01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:32.040
One. two. One. two.
One. two. One. two...

720
01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:35.320
Leon. the whole neighbourhood
can hear ya.

721
01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:36.960
So?

722
01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.280
I was training.

723
01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:42.200
I hope you're not thinking of
getting into any trouble

724
01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:44.240
like those yobs on the street.

725
01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.920
No. of course not.

726
01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:48.240
Good. Your tea's ready. let's eat.

727
01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:51.040
I'll have it later.

728
01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:59.280
One. two. One. two...

729
01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:04.920
£2...

730
01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:14.360
£2.50...

731
01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:19.720
£3.50...

732
01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:22.680
£4.

733
01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:26.680
It's going to take us
forever to get to Bristol.

734
01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:30.640
Hello. Mr and Mrs Atwell.

735
01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:33.120
Hello. Leon.

736
01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:35.440
Do you need any more
help on your plot today?

737
01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.760
Not today. Have a good day.

738
01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:39.360
You too.

739
01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:06.640
No-one understands a word coming
out of your nasty little mouth.

740
01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.520
You needed that. innit?

741
01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:48.640
Why was Castro fighting with them?

742
01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:52.040
He was defending himself.

743
01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:54.000
To protect the people he loves.

744
01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
You may not understand that now...
I do.

745
01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:59.760
I want to protect
the people I love. too.

746
01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:02.600
You're a special kid.

747
01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:06.160
I hope you know we're here
to protect you too.

748
01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:15.600
Yo.

749
01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:21.880
Sorry about what happened
to Castro.

750
01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:24.440
You sure about that?
Of course I'm sure.

751
01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:25.840
Well. somebody called them here.

752
01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:28.360
And you think it was me?
Who else?

753
01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:30.720
Let me tell you something.
All right?

754
01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:33.960
This is my land.
So I ain't going nowhere.

755
01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:36.160
Well. the police were bound
to come knocking.

756
01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:37.920
Your mate was leading a protest.

757
01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:42.200
Did you call them?
No.

758
01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:46.400
Listen. I know we've had our
differences.

759
01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:47.960
but I'm no snitch.

760
01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:49.840
I'm sorry about what happened.

761
01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:56.080
Don't go to the protest.
you're on their radar.

762
01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:59.880
Do you want me to help you?
I got this!

763
01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:25.120
Is Castro going to be all right?

764
01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:30.320
I don't know.

765
01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:32.360
Why did they take him
away like that?

766
01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:35.360
Were you scared?

767
01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:45.120
Look. I'm sorry you had to see that.
but you needed to.

768
01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:49.040
Just don't think they wouldn't bust
down your little hut

769
01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:51.280
and mess you up the same way.

770
01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:54.560
They don't care if you're a youth.
all them see is your skin.

771
01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:59.640
You ain't no little seed no more.

772
01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:09.680
Don't ever let anyone tell you
what you can be.

773
01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:10.960
Right?

774
01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:15.840
Good.

775
01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:35.040
Le?

776
01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:36.240
Le!

777
01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:41.920
Get ready. social worker's coming.

778
01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:44.520
We want to make a good impression.
yeah?

779
01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:47.400
# You make me feel like dancing

780
01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:49.920
# Gonna dance the night away... #

781
01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:05.920
Can I get you anything else?

782
01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:07.200
Some more tea?

783
01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:10.320
Fizzy pop?

784
01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:13.120
No. thank you. I'm great now.

785
01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:16.760
I was wondering if I could. er. have
a moment with Leon alone.

786
01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:20.760
Would that be all right?

787
01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:22.120
Oh.

788
01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:24.720
Yes. of course.

789
01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:31.720
If you need anything.
I'll be in the other room.

790
01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:34.160
Waiting.

791
01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:37.160
Great. thanks.

792
01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:49.680
How are you doing?

793
01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:51.600
What happened to Salma?

794
01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:53.080
She's on another case.

795
01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:56.080
But. you know. I like to come
and check how things are getting on.

796
01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:58.440
Will I get a family like Jake?

797
01:12:58.440 --> 01:12:59.840
You know...

798
01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:03.880
..I actually oversaw
your brother's adoption.

799
01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:06.080
and we're working really hard
to get the same for you.

800
01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:08.280
It's just a bit difficult because...
I'm black.

801
01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:09.880
That's not true. Leon.

802
01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:12.640
It's just a lot easier
to find permanent homes for babies.

803
01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:14.960
and not so easy for...
Black children like me.

804
01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:17.000
..older children.

805
01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.440
We really didn't want to split
you and your brother up.

806
01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:21.640
But it was for the best.
No. it wasn't!

807
01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:25.320
I know it sounds strange. but I
promise you it was for the best.

808
01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:27.600
No! He's my brother. OK. mine!

809
01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:30.560
And you took him away from me.
because we look different.

810
01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:32.880
No. that's not the case. Leon.
Leon. come back.

811
01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:43.760
Agh!

812
01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:51.200
What on Earth?!

813
01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:56.200
Don't move.

814
01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:58.120
Excuse me!

815
01:13:58.120 --> 01:13:59.520
Yes. you.

816
01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:01.640
You can leave now.
thank you very much.

817
01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:03.720
He was fine before you came along.

818
01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:05.320
He's only a little boy.

819
01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:09.120
OK. Sit yourself down.

820
01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:10.440
There you go.

821
01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:15.360
Got the first aid box right here.

822
01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:21.240
A little bit of Germolene.

823
01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:22.960
It's going to sting. all right?

824
01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:27.840
I don't want to hurt you.

825
01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:29.960
Cos we like each other. don't we?
Yes.

826
01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:34.560
Or at least we have a nice
arrangement where we pretend to.

827
01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:39.440
Right. press on it there. press down
hard.

828
01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:46.400
I've got some advice for you.

829
01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:49.400
Don't make a mess on your own
doorstep.

830
01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:50.840
Do you understand?

831
01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:55.000
Oh. love...

832
01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:00.360
The world's unfair.

833
01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:04.360
Always has been. always will be.

834
01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:08.080
But what really matters...

835
01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:12.120
..is how you handle it.

836
01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:15.480
Yeah?

837
01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:19.000
Do you understand?

838
01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:27.200
All right. now. tidy this up.

839
01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:39.200
Maureen! Come here. love.
Oh-ho!

840
01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:42.560
Careful. Lee. she's fragile.

841
01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:44.920
I've missed you so much.

842
01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:48.880
I'm glad you're back.

843
01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:09.640
What happened?

844
01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:14.160
They killed him.

845
01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:20.200
Castro is dead.

846
01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:52.520
The death of Castro Conway
in police custody

847
01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:55.400
has caused an uproar in Birmingham.
as racial tensions...

848
01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:58.400
You should have seen it.
Mo. it was chaos.

849
01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:01.480
Police and gangs everywhere.
It's getting worse round here.

850
01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:06.920
It's the police's fault.
What's that? Nothing.

851
01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:08.480
Le. switch that telly off.

852
01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:11.320
Mo. come and get this goodness
inside you. come on.

853
01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.440
Oh. look at you.

854
01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:19.320
You are not going to manage here.
not with all these stairs.

855
01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:21.600
You need someone to keep
an eye on you.

856
01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:25.680
Make sure you're eating properly.

857
01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:28.920
Not overdoing it.

858
01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:32.000
I'm not ready to lose you just yet -
you're all I've got.

859
01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:37.400
You all right? You're really quiet.

860
01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:39.120
Just tired.

861
01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:40.960
Can I go to bed?

862
01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:42.640
Who's going to eat all this?

863
01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:44.360
I'm not hungry.

864
01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:46.480
All right. love.
see you in the morning.

865
01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:54.760
Have you heard back from
Social Services?

866
01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:56.840
I've told them - he's the last
one...

867
01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:00.320
..and they're not to go springing
any more surprises on you. Sylvie...

868
01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:04.360
Soon as you're well again. you
and I are going to start a new life.

869
01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:06.000
somewhere by the coast.

870
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.640
That would be lovely -
probably help me get better. too.

871
01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:14.840
Peace and love. you know?
Peace and love.

872
01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:22.120
Too long we fight now. you know?

873
01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:24.800
We not trouble.

874
01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:27.880
All we want to do is come here
and live in peace!

875
01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:29.600
Peace!

876
01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:30.960
Two days ago...

877
01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:34.360
..me lost me friend.

878
01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:36.520
Sorry.

879
01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:40.080
Me not lost him. Babylon there...

880
01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:44.480
..says it's OK to take him and kill
him!

881
01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:48.960
Because he want protest.

882
01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:53.200
Because he was using his mouth to
speak to the oppressor.

883
01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:55.320
Say no more!

884
01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:58.240
No more! Justice. we say.

885
01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:02.800

887
01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:21.640
Tufty! Don't!

888
01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:23.200
Tufty!

889
01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:27.760
Justice! Yo! What are you doing?

No! Stop!

894
01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:40.840
I dare you. go on! Do it.

895
01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.400
I'm not afraid of you.

896
01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:44.680
You can't take anything
away from me!

897
01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:46.360
I've lost everything! You hear me?!

898
01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:47.880
I don't care any more!

899
01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:50.480
You can't hurt me.
You can't hurt anyone any more!

900
01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:53.400
Hit me! Do it. go on!
Hit me like you hit my friend!

901
01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:55.600

Leon.

905
01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:29.320
Leon.

906
01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:50.960
Come here. love. Come on.

907
01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:54.000
Oh. sweetheart.

908
01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:18.520
Just what have I missed
while I've been away?

909
01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:20.320
It's like a war zone out there.

910
01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:22.040
Why are you mixed up in all of that?

911
01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:23.880
Cos people are dying.

912
01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:35.440
Hey. Breathe.

913
01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:37.120
Breathe.

914
01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:30.840
Thank you. Leon.

915
01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:41.080
I'm just going to leave you
two alone.

916
01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:44.000
but I'm just going to be here.
all right? Yeah?

917
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.080
Look at you.
You're nearly as tall as me now.

918
01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:49.400
Oh.

919
01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:53.720
Have you given up on me?

920
01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:05.440
They keep telling me
a kid needs stability and security.

921
01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:06.920
like I don't know that.

922
01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:14.600
You know I'm not well. love?

923
01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:16.080
I'm not well at all.

924
01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:17.480
You can see that. can't you?

925
01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:32.920
Listen. Leon. I want you to
be happy.

926
01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:34.600
like our little Jake.

927
01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:39.920
Looked after by people who care
about you and can provide for you.

928
01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:43.680
Give you all the stuff that
you...that you need and deserve.

929
01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:47.640
God...

930
01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:49.360
It's going to be all right.

931
01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:52.240
You can come and see me any time you
want. OK?

932
01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:59.000
I'm sorry.

933
01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:03.760
I didn't want it to be like this.

934
01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:14.120
Listen. I love you and Jake more
than anything in the world...

935
01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:17.200
..never. ever forget that.

936
01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:19.160
OK?

937
01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:22.640
Go on. look after yourself.

938
01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.560
Snack?

939
01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:49.280
I've been talking with the social
workers about looking after

940
01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:51.720
you for a bit longer. till you
finish school.

941
01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:53.920
I'm afraid you're staying put. love.

942
01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:09.520
"Dear Jake. I've learned
a lot of things since you went.

943
01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:12.040
"Some good things
and some sad things.

944
01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:18.080
"Sylvia says what doesn't kill you.
makes you stronger -

945
01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:19.560
"she says it a lot.

946
01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:21.760
"But. most of all.
she makes us laugh.

947
01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:25.480
"And. on a good day.
Maureen makes her shepherd's pie."

948
01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:45.040
"Tufty's teaching me about cuttings.

949
01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:49.480
"You need to keep them warm
and watered. and take care of them."

950
01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:53.120
Hi. Desree.
Where are you going? To my hut.

951
01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:55.760
Oh. Planting some seeds? Yeah.

952
01:26:57.240 --> 01:27:00.120
"Sometimes it takes
time for the roots to grow properly.

953
01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:04.080
"but they will grow to be strong.
like the plant they came from.

954
01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:06.760
"That's what I think of you
and Mum.

955
01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:09.600
"We're being taken
care of in different places.

956
01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:12.000
"but we are cuttings
from the same plant.

957
01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:22.760
"I think of you a lot. Jake.
I hope you're happy.

958
01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:25.440
"I'll never forget the day
you were taken."

959
01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:33.360
Miss you.

960
01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:38.800
"Maureen says that

961
01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:41.560
"when I'm older. there will be
nothing to stop me finding you.

962
01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:45.840
"I promise I will."
