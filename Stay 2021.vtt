00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.680
- Hey guys. it's Olivia
and welcome to my channel.

4
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.100
This is my very first vlog.

5
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.180
so sorry if it's a little bit shaky.

6
00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.670
So I just recently moved to
New York to pursue modeling

7
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.423
and so far I've been going on
castings. test shoots. and uh.

8
00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.453
getting lost.

9
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.850
A lot.

10
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.460
My dream is to walk in the
Biggest Night in Fashion

11
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.880
and wear those gorgeous wings.

12
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.023
That'd be literally life changing.

13
00:04:10.924 --> 00:04:12.630
- Thank you.

14
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.670
- When I came here.

15
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.534
I knew I wasn't gonna be
right for every client.

16
00:04:29.362 --> 00:04:30.862
- I love New York.

17
00:04:34.585 --> 00:04:35.730
Come on.

18
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.810
Things here move pretty fast.

19
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.130
There's always an event to
go to. someone new to meet.

20
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.520
Here to support my friend
Mia at Fashion Week.

21
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.396
Check out her amazing
makeup at miakaibeauty.com.

22
00:04:47.396 --> 00:04:48.600

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.343
And here is the beautiful.
the amazing Giovanna handbag.

24
00:04:54.804 --> 00:04:55.640
- Really?

25
00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.110
You try to eat right. but
just in case you forget...

26
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.070
In this industry. there's
quite a bit of pressure

27
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.870
to grow your following. build your brand.

28
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.630
We may not have the beach in
New York. but we have this.

29
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.943
It's a tough job. but
somebody's gotta do it.

30
00:05:14.785 --> 00:05:16.500
I have chocolate in my hair.

31
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.610
Just a quick hello to my new followers.

32
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.340

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.760
They're looking for models
who are influencers.

35
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.930
That means every view.
every subscriber counts.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.770
Just woke up to 10.000 subscribers.

37

See you back in New York.

43
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.944
It is way too cold for this.

44
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.880
- The girls in Biggest Night
are all like six-feet tall.

45
00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.170
or they're influencers
with huge followings.

46
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.120
At least there's one
thing I can actually grow.

47
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.523
Guys.

48
00:06:29.523 --> 00:06:30.356

Really hope my mom doesn't see that.

64
00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.420
These are my lucky shoes.

65
00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:14.253
Gotta go.

66
00:07:20.891 --> 00:07:21.724

67
00:07:21.724 --> 00:07:23.053
- Yeah. Mia's here.

68
00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:26.117
- Good. good. Just remember.
footy. or it didn't happen.

69
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.950
- Sorry. Can't help it.

70
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.073
- Baby. I better go.

71
00:07:34.294 --> 00:07:35.330

I love you. too.

74
00:07:40.867 --> 00:07:42.130
"Little monkey"?

75
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:43.860
- Yeah. so?

76
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.650

This is it. guys. Biggest
Night in Fashion casting call.

78
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.940
I'm walking for Mark and Jane today.

79
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.693
and only one girl here
is going to Hong Kong.

80
00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.210
So how was it?

81
00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:02.133
- I think I was too nervous.

82
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:06.070
The lights. the girls.

83
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.060
That is definitely the most
pressure I've felt at a casting.

84
00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.960
I'm sure it was fine.

85
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:11.793
- We'll see.

86
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:22.370

brunch place in the city.

The food here is so good.

This is my Eggs Benedict
with French toast.

92
00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:34.840
Everyone's enjoying themselves. right?

93
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.673

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:08.523
It's official.

109

You're flying to Hong Kong for
the Biggest Night in Fashion.

110
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:11.713
- Holy shit!

111
00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.320
Oh. my god. I'm so sorry.

112
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.350
Oh. my god. I got it!

113
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:19.198
- I'm so proud of you!

114
00:09:19.198 --> 00:09:20.031
- What?

115
00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:22.800
We need our drinks. ladies.

116
00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.620
- To Liv.

117
00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.970
My friend and total goddess.

118
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:32.410
Yes. what do you wanna
say to the people watching?

119
00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:34.700
- Thank you for believing in me.

120
00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:35.897
And?

121
00:09:35.897 --> 00:09:37.490

122
00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:40.179
- And get ready. I'm gonna work it.

123
00:09:40.179 --> 00:09:41.771
Woo! Biggest Night!

124
00:09:41.771 --> 00:09:43.696
- Biggest Night.
- Biggest Night.

125
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:52.177
- He's here. Let's go get him.

126
00:10:01.977 --> 00:10:02.810
Hi!

127
00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:07.309
Oh. is... Hold
on. hold on one minute.

128
00:10:07.309 --> 00:10:10.059
You left your luggage.

129
00:10:11.061 --> 00:10:13.111
- I couldn't wait. I couldn't wait. love.

130
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.200
- Guys. this is Jules.

131
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.123
- Hello.

132
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.700
- Poor Jules. He always
struggles with his luggage.

133
00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.683
Your backpack is open.

134
00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.070
Hey guys.

135
00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:41.130
It is Jules' first day in the city.

136
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.250
so I'm gonna show him around a little.

137
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:46.193
and then we're gonna
look at some apartments.

138
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:48.123
Are you excited?

139
00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.523
He's a little jet-lagged.

140
00:10:53.546 --> 00:10:56.110
Are you ready.
sleepyhead? How's your hair?

141
00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:57.323
- Oh. it's good.

142
00:10:58.210 --> 00:10:59.623
- You're such a diva.

143
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.360
Okay. let's go.

144
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.590
So we're heading over to
see the first apartment.

145
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:07.320
This one is definitely in our
price range. which is good.

146
00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.770
- Mm-hm.

147
00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:10.920
- And then I think we'll eat some lunch

148
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.020
and go see a building in the East Village.

149
00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.110
Okay. guys. so we just checked it out

150
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.220
and you really didn't miss much.

151
00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.053
I don't know.

152
00:11:21.053 --> 00:11:22.370
What do you think. Jules?
You seemed to like it.

153
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:25.283
- I like the price. We can afford it.

154
00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.620
- I don't care if it's
free. I'm not living there.

155
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:37.913
So how's that New York pizza?

156
00:11:40.255 --> 00:11:41.088
- Mm-hm.

157
00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:46.720
- So this is the East Village.

158
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.630
A lot of tiny streets
and interesting shops.

159
00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:51.510
I feel good about this next building.

160
00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:54.010
and Jules has promised
to keep an open mind.

161
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:55.920
Isn't that right. baby?

162
00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.420
I think it's just right there.

163
00:12:01.816 --> 00:12:03.696
Going up.

164
00:12:09.857 --> 00:12:11.440
- I don't think so.

165
00:12:16.913 --> 00:12:18.836
- Okay. I really hope they fix that.

166
00:12:18.836 --> 00:12:20.316
- Seriously.
- 9th floor.

167
00:12:20.316 --> 00:12:22.257
- Not a fan of that.

168
00:12:22.257 --> 00:12:25.090
- Okay. let's go.
- Yeah. let's go.

169
00:12:26.116 --> 00:12:28.320
- Hey. I almost gave up on you.

170
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.708
- Hi. I'm sorry. We got lost.

171
00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:32.410
It's okay. I'm Leo.

172
00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:33.580
- Olivia.

173
00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:35.559
- Julian.
- Hey. nice to meet you two.

174
00:12:35.559 --> 00:12:37.620
- Front door.

175
00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:38.910
- Yeah. so this unit

176
00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:41.241
is larger than the others we talked about.

177
00:12:41.241 --> 00:12:42.531
Bloody hell.

178
00:12:42.531 --> 00:12:44.620
- Yeah. it's an airy space.

179
00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.102
My wife calls it "the angel's nest".

180
00:12:47.102 --> 00:12:49.953
- Oh. I love that.

181
00:12:49.953 --> 00:12:51.782
Whoa.

182
00:12:51.782 --> 00:12:52.982
What?

183
00:12:52.982 --> 00:12:54.593
You like that. huh?

184
00:12:54.593 --> 00:12:55.720
Who's the woman in black?

185
00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.710
- Yeah. she's an antique.
She comes with the building.

186
00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:59.930
Yeah. this whole floor used to be

187
00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.580
a Russian coat factory until 1989.

188
00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.910
The loft conversion.
however. is fairly recent.

189
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:08.560
So as you can see. you have
updated appliances over here.

190
00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:09.713
Michelin rated.

191
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:12.003
- Oops.

192
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:14.823
Babe.

193
00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.143
- Right. sorry. I'll call ya.

194
00:13:18.211 --> 00:13:20.600
Hey. to each his own. pal.

195
00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.280
- What about the neighborhood?
- Oh. yeah. it's very safe.

196
00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.490
It's perfect for a young couple.

197
00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:28.390
- Is there a window open?
- Oh. let's take a look.

198
00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:31.900
Look at this closet.
Fantastic. am I right?

199
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:32.980
It's freezing.

200
00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.880
Yeah. the ventilation is good.

201
00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.930
Oh. yeah. the cleaning
lady found that yesterday.

202
00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:42.251
You can have whatever's in
there. I'll throw that in.

203
00:13:42.251 --> 00:13:44.230
All right.

204
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:47.141
what do you think. hon?

205
00:13:47.141 --> 00:13:51.240
I'm not sure.

206
00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.502
- Well. I've got a cheaper
place over on 28th.

207
00:13:59.553 --> 00:14:03.220
Hon. the meter's runnin'. Anyone home?

208
00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.540
You know what. why
don't you give us a minute?

209
00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:07.174
- Hey. whatever you need.

210
00:14:10.045 --> 00:14:13.170
Are you all
right? You seem a bit off.

211
00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:15.200
- This place speaks to me.

212
00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.493
Are you serious?

213
00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:20.525
- We should stay here. from now on.

214
00:14:20.525 --> 00:14:23.720
Don't
you wanna think about it?

215
00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.250
Maybe come back tomorrow when
there's a bit more light?

216
00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:27.873
- Yeah. it's still available.

217
00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.070
914. that's right. Yep.

218
00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:32.740
Just a second. Yeah. hon?

219
00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.340
- I'll take it.
- Are you sure?

220
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.743
- This is it. This is home.

221
00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.170
Look what I have!
- What you got there. babe?

222
00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:42.410
- I got approved.

223
00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:43.590
Because of the holiday weekend.

224
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:45.530
we won't have power until tomorrow.

225
00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:49.776
so I guess we'll light some
candles and make it romantic.

226
00:14:49.776 --> 00:14:52.073
- Yeah. it's gonna be more
like camping.

227
00:14:52.073 --> 00:14:54.254
- It's still romantic.

228
00:14:55.261 --> 00:14:56.094
Are you okay?

229
00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:57.903
- No. I'm not.

230
00:14:57.903 --> 00:14:59.863
But you're having so much fun!

231
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:01.703
- Right.

232
00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.510
- He loves me.

233
00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.490
- Hello. folks! Jules here.

234
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.600
Well. I've been looking
for something for Olivia

235
00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.840
'cause I've wanted to get
her a special little present.

236
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.430
Something one of a kind. Vintage. maybe.

237
00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:17.067
Seek and ye shall find.

238
00:15:17.067 --> 00:15:20.120
"What's in the box.
Jules? What's in the box?"

239
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.890
Well. I can't tell you that
right now. but trust me.

240
00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:26.720
I found something in this box
that Liv will absolutely love.

241
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.370
and I can't wait to give it to her.

242
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:31.090
So if you wanna see that and a lot more.

243
00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:32.720
go on ahead and subscribe.

244
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.781
Cheers.

245
00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.820
- On my way to NoHo to see my agent.

246
00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.760
She's a scary woman. I'm not gonna lie.

247
00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:45.800
- I assume you're on a diet?

248
00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.433
- Yeah. I mean. of course.

249
00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.240
- You just need some fresh
editorial in your book.

250
00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.740
I'll call Linda at Harpers.

251
00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.520
Did they
say how much I'll get paid?

252
00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.180
- You need to stop filming now.

253
00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.013
Okay.

254
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:06.953
- Big surprise. The elevator's dead.

255
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:10.653
You can do it!

256
00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.613
- I just passed someone on
six. He gave up and died.

257
00:16:16.973 --> 00:16:18.403
He's so dramatic.

258
00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.010
- What was that?

259
00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:23.640
- I said you're so romantic?

260
00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.700
Are those for me?

261
00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.600
- No. they're for my funeral. darling.

262
00:16:30.588 --> 00:16:32.457
I do wanna give you something. though.

263
00:16:32.457 --> 00:16:35.680
Uh. not out
here in the hallway.

264
00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.924
- Not that. yet.

265
00:16:37.924 --> 00:16:40.360
Well. I know I don't
bring a lot to the table.

266
00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.670
until I get a job and all
that. but I think I can be

267
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.964
a big help with the
camera. editing. all that.

268
00:16:45.964 --> 00:16:48.590
Baby. you're
already helping me so much.

269
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:50.150
I'm not worried about the money.

270
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:53.450
- Still. I wanted to get you something.

271
00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:55.303
What is all this?

272
00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.740
Wait. you hold it. I
wanna show this on camera.

273
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:04.330
Yeah. I had
to get a chain for it.

274
00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:06.460
I know it's not much. but uh-

275
00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.773
- Are you kidding? It's everything.

276
00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:10.813
It's beautiful.

277
00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:13.490
Antique.

278
00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:14.610
Where'd you find this?

279
00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:17.130
Oh. let's just say it found me.

280
00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:18.693
Key to my heart. darling.

281
00:17:18.693 --> 00:17:21.380
- I love it.

282
00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:26.090
So I'm gonna do this
little clay mask and try on

283
00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:27.970
my new key

284
00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.603
necklace from Jules.

285
00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:41.520
Are you done in there?

286
00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.573
- Just a second!

287
00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.060
So we're all cozy on the floor.

288
00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:02.283
Some of us more than others.

289
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:06.043
My back is killing me.

290
00:18:06.885 --> 00:18:08.685
- We should've just stayed at Mia's.

291
00:18:09.982 --> 00:18:11.363
I know. baby.

292
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.073
I'm just grumpy. I'm
sorry. Go back to sleep.

293
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:22.700
Well. good night.

294
00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.733
I will see you guys in the morning.

295
00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:28.460
Good morning. guys.

296
00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.560
I'm doing an early press day for BN

297
00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:33.690
and I am here with my
personal beauty pro. Mia Kai.

298
00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:35.510
- Is it always this cold in here?

299
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:38.557
- And you. out the way.

300
00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.253
Sorry. love.

301
00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.640
How about you.

302
00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.590
- Definitely ready.

303
00:18:48.877 --> 00:18:49.957
I love you.

304
00:18:49.957 --> 00:18:50.790
And her.

305
00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:53.630
- Say it.

306
00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:55.090
Say it.

307
00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:55.923
- What?

308
00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:59.350
Liv. it's early.

309
00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:00.183
- Oh. come on.

310
00:19:02.792 --> 00:19:04.790
- I'll get you. my pretties!

311
00:19:05.903 --> 00:19:09.230
I love it when she does that.

312
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:10.630
- We're ready to roll.

313
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:11.630
- Okay!

314
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:12.853
Let's get beautiful.

315
00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.910
So. I've got my face on and
what do we call this one?

316
00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:19.650
- Rose all day.

317
00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:21.313
- That's it. I love it.

318
00:19:24.172 --> 00:19:25.005
Ta-da!

319
00:19:25.005 --> 00:19:27.204
- Oh. yeah. that's it.
- Absolutely perfect.

320
00:19:27.204 --> 00:19:28.140
Love it.

321
00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:29.670
- I'm red carpet ready. guys.

322
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.410
Be sure to check out my
live feed at two pm Eastern

323
00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:33.803
and see you downtown.

324
00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:40.160
- I just did my first
press conference for BN.

325
00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.230
Now we're heading into the
media tent for some interviews

326
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:46.932
and I actually have no
idea what I'm doing.

327
00:19:46.932 --> 00:19:48.840
- Good to meet you.
- You too.

328
00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:52.640
- Joining us now is the
stunning Olivia Song.

329
00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.740
- Thank you. Hi.

330
00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.470
- Not only are you the newest BN Goddess.

331
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:59.180
but you are the first ever Korean woman

332
00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:00.780
to walk the Biggest Night in Fashion.

333
00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:02.860
Do you feel any added pressure?

334
00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.754
- I don't think so. but now
that you've mentioned it...

335
00:20:06.587 --> 00:20:08.350
- Well. it certainly is
a big moment. isn't it?

336
00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:09.340
- It is.

337
00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:12.950
- As someone with a
very. very popular vlog.

338
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:16.650
is there anything that you
won't do or show on camera?

339
00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:19.543
- If it's happening in my
life. it's probably on video.

340
00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:23.330
My channel is very raw and real.

341
00:20:33.084 --> 00:20:34.584
Did you hear that?

342
00:20:36.344 --> 00:20:38.011
Baby. are you awake?

343
00:21:05.376 --> 00:21:06.209
Shit.

344
00:21:28.224 --> 00:21:33.172
Oh...

345
00:21:33.172 --> 00:21:34.339
What the fuck?

346
00:21:35.984 --> 00:21:38.590
- Front door.

347
00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:39.863
- Hello?

348
00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:46.027
So. there's this note
that says "I'm here."

349
00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.370
Maybe he already fixed it.

350
00:22:07.991 --> 00:22:08.824
Good.

351
00:22:24.735 --> 00:22:27.050
- Front door.

352
00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:30.170
- Hi. I'm Rasto. the building Super.

353
00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:32.623
Your boyfriend. he say there is problem.

Yeah. I got your
note. It's still happening.

355
00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:38.417
- Mm. but I not look at it yet.

356
00:22:38.417 --> 00:22:40.950
But you were
here earlier. I got...

357
00:22:43.358 --> 00:22:46.100
It doesn't matter. Can you look at it now?

358
00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.020
Please. don't film me.

359
00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:53.640
- So. I am happy to report

360
00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:56.100
we have first world plumbing again.

361
00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.890
- Oh. yeah. it's all good.
It was nothing in the end.

362
00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:00.910
Yeah. we've got a bed. we've got power.

363
00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:03.678
We've even got this!

364
00:23:04.511 --> 00:23:05.918
- Where did you get that?

365
00:23:05.918 --> 00:23:06.751
- 1980.

366
00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:10.880
- Actually. I found it on
the street for a fiver.

367
00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.610
Do you wanna watch that tape?

368
00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:13.560
- Not really.

369
00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.180
- Come on.

370
00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:17.270
Could be a bit of fun.

371
00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:18.743
- It's not gonna be porn.

372
00:23:25.408 --> 00:23:26.478
Here we go.

373
00:23:32.528 --> 00:23:34.408
- I'd like to see her smile.

374
00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:40.790
Oh. this how they always start.

375
00:23:47.128 --> 00:23:49.488
Tell him your name.

376
00:23:49.488 --> 00:23:51.820
- I'm Tatiana from Odessa.

377
00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:52.930
Yeah. you are.

378
00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:54.463
And what do you say?

379
00:23:55.372 --> 00:23:58.543
- I'm happy to do with great pleasure.

380
00:23:58.543 --> 00:24:00.610
Baby. this
is weird. Can we stop?

381
00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:03.480
Hold on.
It's just getting good.

382
00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.332
This is
a very special beauty.

383
00:24:05.332 --> 00:24:08.110
This is Valya. from Kiev.

384
00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:11.073
- My god. she is... Wow.

385
00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:14.253
She just
take a bath for you.

386
00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.060
Fresh and clean.

387
00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:18.810
I'm not watching this.

388
00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:20.040
What? Why?

389
00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.390
- Come on. let's go to bed.

390
00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:29.933
Baby.

391
00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.723
Baby. wake up. It's happening again.

392
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:35.833
- What?

393
00:24:35.833 --> 00:24:37.020
The bathroom.

394
00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:40.220
The water's running.

395
00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:41.722
Weren't you just in there?

396
00:24:41.722 --> 00:24:42.555
- No.

397
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:46.762
Well. can you go check. please?

398
00:24:46.762 --> 00:24:47.595
- I'm sleeping.

399
00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:51.993
Don't make me
go in there by myself.

400
00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.100
- All right. I'm right behind you.

401
00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:56.933
Come on.

402
00:25:03.334 --> 00:25:05.001
- Here. give me that.

403
00:25:13.387 --> 00:25:15.463
- I think it's getting worse.

404
00:25:20.576 --> 00:25:24.324
I think I just pissed
myself. Are you happy?

405
00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:27.900
Oh. you are so done.

406
00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:30.460
Consider your happy life officially over.

407
00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:32.650
- Oh. it's over. huh?

408
00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:33.630
- Over. Done.

409
00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:34.930
- Oh.
- Mm-hm. mm-hm.

410
00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:36.256
Uh-uh. get away from me.

411
00:25:36.256 --> 00:25:38.340
- Oh. it was worth it.
- Oh. no.

412
00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:41.216
No more fun for you. mister.
- Oh. what? Little monkey.

413
00:25:41.216 --> 00:25:42.147
- No! Don't "little monkey" me.

414
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:45.644
- Oh. come on!

415
00:25:45.644 --> 00:25:47.061
- You're so mean.

416
00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:52.230
My name is Olivia and I'm an alcoholic.

417
00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:53.715
Hi. Olivia.

418
00:25:53.715 --> 00:25:56.344
- You can't be this cute.
- Oh. but I am.

419
00:25:56.344 --> 00:25:58.573
Oh. look at that! The rum is here.

420
00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:01.430
- Put that back. It's for our guests.

421
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:02.263
Sorry.

422
00:26:02.263 --> 00:26:03.500
- Babe. you really wanna be helpful?

423
00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.250
Throw out that box and get dressed.

424
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:09.423
Oh! No more sexy time?

425
00:26:14.173 --> 00:26:15.595
What? Is the lift on the blink. eh?

426
00:26:15.595 --> 00:26:17.452
It's condemned.

427
00:26:17.452 --> 00:26:19.132
- Condemned?
- Da.

428
00:26:19.132 --> 00:26:19.995
That's serious.

429
00:26:19.995 --> 00:26:21.740
- Hey. kid.
- Yeah. mate?

430
00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.160
- Where are you going with that box?

431
00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:26.020
- Just the rubbish chute.
-  I knew it.

432
00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:28.110
Boxes get stuck in chute.

433
00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:31.623
Trash gets stuck in chute.
It stink up whole floor.

434
00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:34.940
You must put in dumpster from now on.

435
00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:36.460
Right. Didn't know that.

436
00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:38.310
- Yes. Well. you do now.

437
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:40.210
- Cheers. mate. Sorry.
- Yes.

438
00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:42.400
Hey. kid! Kid. kid. kid!
- Yeah?

439
00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.533
- So. what is it with you and this camera?

440
00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:48.730
Well. my girlfriend
is a model. so we just shoot

441
00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:51.180
everything. you know. life.
really. but just everything.

442
00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:52.663
- And now my life. too?

443
00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:55.793
Do you not wanna be on camera?

444
00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:00.725
- I like privacy. Is Russian way.

445
00:27:00.725 --> 00:27:02.190
Hm?

446
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:04.205
Right. Sorry about that. mate.

447
00:27:04.205 --> 00:27:05.038
Cheers.

448
00:27:05.941 --> 00:27:07.652
- "Cheers. cheers."

449
00:27:07.652 --> 00:27:09.160
"Cheers."

450
00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.303
- I got ya.

451
00:27:17.561 --> 00:27:18.640
Uh-oh!

452
00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.412
No one tell trash police.

453
00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:24.913
Dosvedanya. comrade.

454
00:27:30.121 --> 00:27:31.580
Hold on. mate. Open me one.

455
00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:33.510
I've got to shoot here and everything.

456
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:34.590
- Come on!
- We got too excited.

457
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:37.349
I know. I'm trying
to document and everything.

458
00:27:37.349 --> 00:27:38.469
You leave me out.

459
00:27:38.469 --> 00:27:39.968
- What is this. like our third cheers?

460
00:27:39.968 --> 00:27:41.690
- There we are.
- Cheers.

461
00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:43.567
- Look in the eyes.
- Yeah.

462
00:27:43.567 --> 00:27:45.990
Not bad. Although.
I do miss a good kebab.

463
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:48.727
I didn't even think
we had any orange juice here.

464
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:53.373
- You can pose her. if you want.

465
00:27:54.296 --> 00:27:55.129
- I'm all right.

466
00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.360
- It's him. not you. Don't worry.

467
00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.110
- As long as you're
vlogging. I'm down to rap.

468
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:04.016
but you gotta feature me on your vlog.

469
00:28:04.016 --> 00:28:05.795
- Um. as of right now. yes.

470
00:28:05.795 --> 00:28:06.628
Yeah. come on. mate.

471
00:28:06.628 --> 00:28:08.483
You got somethin' else up your sleeve?

472
00:28:08.483 --> 00:28:10.280
What we got. what we got?

473
00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.253
- Yeah. yo.

474
00:28:13.227 --> 00:28:14.547
whenever I gotta do it

475
00:28:14.547 --> 00:28:16.396
the better I give it to ya

476
00:28:16.396 --> 00:28:17.918
whenever I write a lyric

477
00:28:17.918 --> 00:28:19.766
ending and never will lie to ya

478
00:28:19.766 --> 00:28:21.535
on the mic right now

479
00:28:21.535 --> 00:28:23.198
out. hype right now

480
00:28:23.198 --> 00:28:24.804
your mic might sound

481
00:28:24.804 --> 00:28:28.028
mic right now like aww

482
00:28:28.028 --> 00:28:30.446
- That was awesome.
- All right. all right!

483
00:28:30.446 --> 00:28:31.570
- Yeah. cheers.

484
00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:32.630
- So I say to him.

485
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:34.690
we need to come see
y'all's haunted apartment.

486
00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:37.580
And then he suddenly
don't wanna come no more.

487
00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:38.900
- It's not haunted.

488
00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:42.030
it just needs a bit of maintenance
and maybe we have rats.

489
00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:43.440
- Nah. I don't do rats.

490
00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.158
- Would you rather it be something else?

491
00:28:45.158 --> 00:28:46.980
- Well. I ain't fuckin'
with no ghosts either.

492
00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:49.253
- Guys. this is my dream apartment.

493
00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.010
but the elevator has problems.

494
00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:54.278
the water is definitely questionable.

495
00:28:54.278 --> 00:28:55.250
- It's gross.

496
00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:56.600
- You guys think I should break the lease?

497
00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.790
- Girl! I think you
should break the Internet.

498
00:28:58.790 --> 00:28:59.850
Just think about how many views

499
00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:01.750
you've had since you moved in.

500
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:03.045
You should get yourself one of them

501
00:29:03.045 --> 00:29:04.345
Ouija boards or somethin'.

502
00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:06.503
- What?

503
00:29:06.503 --> 00:29:10.780
- This is a fashion vlog.
it's not Paranormal-whatever.

504
00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:11.650
- But it could be.

505
00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:13.900
You should've set up a camera
the moment you started seeing

506
00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:15.860
weird shit or hearing weird shit.

507
00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:18.758
You know how many people would
watch if you did a seance?

508
00:29:18.758 --> 00:29:21.470
Oh. shit.
That's why my baby gets paid.

509
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:23.140
- Right? Like conjure it up!

510
00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:24.800
I wouldn't do that.

511
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.370
Why not?

512
00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:30.730
- Being in media is not
the same as being a medium.

513
00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:32.930
- Why don't you do some
of your witchy shit

514
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:34.280
and help a girl go viral?

515
00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:37.070
- It's not that easy.

516
00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:39.300
- Hold up. Are you a Wiccan?

517
00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.387
Recovering Catholic.

518
00:29:41.387 --> 00:29:43.450
- You know. I could set up a live feed.

519
00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:44.283
If we're gonna stay.

520
00:29:44.283 --> 00:29:45.570
we might as well get something out of it.

521
00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:46.403
Could be fun.

522
00:29:51.526 --> 00:29:56.526
Well. it looks like someone
is counting shoes. Not sheep.

523
00:29:59.049 --> 00:30:02.477
Brilliant.

524
00:30:02.477 --> 00:30:04.394
What're you doing. Liv?

525
00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:12.659
Just disappearing in the
middle of the night. eh?

526
00:30:12.659 --> 00:30:14.159
Oh. that's normal.

527
00:30:39.157 --> 00:30:40.468
Got ya.

528
00:30:42.638 --> 00:30:43.555
What the...

529
00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:46.183
Where you at?

530
00:30:48.548 --> 00:30:51.428
Christ.

531
00:30:58.922 --> 00:31:00.833
Christ!

532
00:31:00.833 --> 00:31:02.865
Fucking hell. Liv!

533
00:31:09.787 --> 00:31:11.717
That's very good.

534
00:31:11.717 --> 00:31:13.763
The detail is intense.

535
00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:16.850
I thought you hated her.

536
00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:20.683
- She's beautiful.

537
00:31:23.904 --> 00:31:25.237
Okay?

538
00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:16.580
- Take off your shirt. please.

539
00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:22.553
Wait here.

540
00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:32.210
- I'm going on record
to say. no more parties.

541
00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:34.120
no more distractions.

542
00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:35.360
It's unprofessional.

543
00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:38.640
Especially when you need to
look your best for the clients.

544
00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.140
Jules was sweet about it. though.

545
00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:43.930
He promised to stop scaring
me with the mannequin.

546
00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:47.568
But I put a wig on it
just to weird him out.

547
00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:56.243
But seriously. starting today.
I'm all about the business.

548
00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.600
- Care to step into my office?

549
00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:04.260
No. I wanna film
that segment we talked about.

550
00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:06.580
Karen thinks I need more health
and beauty-based content.

551
00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:09.430
- Yeah. it's just so boring.

552
00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:13.040
Maybe to you. but
people like it. so chop-chop.

553
00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.480
- Did you drop the camera?
Get it wet or something?

554
00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:16.313
No.

555
00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.350
- This footage is all glitchy.

556
00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:21.270
Are you trying to
get out of shooting today?

557
00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:24.276
Is this your "technical
difficulties" excuse?

558
00:33:24.276 --> 00:33:25.450
- No.

559
00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:27.500
- Well. come on. I'm all set up in there.

560
00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:33.710
So. a lot of you have
been asking about my diet.

561
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:36.230
and what I do to look and feel my best.

562
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:38.190
To make my favorite smoothie.

563
00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:42.163
I literally just use tons of
fresh fruit and leafy greens.

564
00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:45.659
Oh. my god!

565
00:33:45.659 --> 00:33:46.843
What's wrong?

566
00:33:46.843 --> 00:33:48.630
- What did you do to this?

567
00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:49.780
I washed it. that's it.

568
00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:52.050
- Okay. you need to smell this.

569
00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:53.720
- What?
- It smells like a foot.

570
00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.100
- Whoa. good god.
- See?

571
00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.190
Okay. just cut it.

572
00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:59.390
Take two. Sadly. I had
to throw my produce out.

573
00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:01.870
Jules showered with it. clearly.

574
00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:03.830
I also really love coffee smoothies.

575
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:06.440
Especially in the morning
when I need an extra kick.

576
00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.420
which is basically every day.

577
00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.224
So. let's blend.

578
00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.233
Okay. Must be the base.

579
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:20.740
Did we blow a fuse?

580
00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:23.768
- Can you just not break my things. okay?

581
00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:31.703
- What?

582
00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:35.460
Bugger that.

583
00:34:46.601 --> 00:34:48.790
This is getting ridiculous.

584
00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:51.003
Sounds like they're
practically in the closet.

585
00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.560
This goes on all hours of the night.

586
00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.800
At first. Liv was the only
one that noticed and...

587
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:03.793
Well. now she sleeps right
through it.

588
00:35:05.201 --> 00:35:06.534
You up. darling?

589
00:35:08.938 --> 00:35:10.183
Yeah. out cold.

590
00:35:11.067 --> 00:35:14.283
And earlier. I could've sworn
something grabbed my foot.

591
00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:18.950
Probably Liv. She can
be quite the snuggler.

592
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:21.329
Isn't that right. little monkey?

593
00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:26.170
It's all right. it's all
right. it's all right.

594
00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:29.369
It's just a dream. Liv.

595
00:35:29.369 --> 00:35:32.120
- You're gonna die. You're gonna die!

596
00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.700
- No. no. no. no. I'm just right here.

597
00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.870
We're fine. I'm fine. You're fine. love.

598
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:38.710
It's all right. wake up. It's okay.

599
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:40.657
Liv. just wake up.

600
00:35:40.657 --> 00:35:42.720
Shh.

601
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.270
You're all right. I've got you.

602
00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:49.390
It's early.

603
00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.200
How much did all that cost?

604
00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.503
- Trust me. we need it.

605
00:35:58.187 --> 00:35:59.587
Boom.

606
00:36:02.024 --> 00:36:04.450
- Okay. so it was expensive.

607
00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:05.965
Why?

608
00:36:05.965 --> 00:36:07.390
It's a webcam. darling.

609
00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:10.750
Now we can livestream to
your page 24 hours a day.

610
00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:12.490
How do I know when it's on?

611
00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:13.800
- Oh. it's always on.

612
00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.800
but that red light means it's recording.

613
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:19.790
- I was afraid you were gonna say that.

614
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:21.350
Listen. you
just got 1.000 comments

615
00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:23.060
about your blender.

616
00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:25.113
Even I admit that was bizarre.

617
00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.500
All right. all right.

618
00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:32.060
It senses movement and it tracks it

619
00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:33.713
and we have night vision.

620
00:36:35.537 --> 00:36:36.510
- "We?"

621
00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:38.040
If something
so much as farts in here.

622
00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.812
we're gonna catch it.

623
00:36:39.812 --> 00:36:41.572
- And when do I get to be off camera?

624
00:36:41.572 --> 00:36:44.279
- What would be the point of that?

625
00:36:45.863 --> 00:36:50.570
That is my camera app
telling me that we're live.

626
00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:51.503
Hello.

627
00:36:53.331 --> 00:36:54.880
I'm going back to bed.

628
00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:56.879
- We're tapping into
something special here. love.

629
00:36:56.879 --> 00:36:59.011
Something we can monetize.

630
00:36:59.011 --> 00:37:00.403
Do you work today?

631
00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:04.443
Someone has
to pay for all this.

632
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:17.693
Wakey wakey.

633
00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.483
She's a heavy sleeper.

634
00:37:24.699 --> 00:37:27.110
It's time to get up. darling.

635
00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:27.943
Ah. brilliant.

636
00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:31.823
Liv. darling.

637
00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:41.843
Liv!

638
00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:44.703
- What?

639
00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:49.463
Look at my skin.

640
00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:51.803
It's total shit.

641
00:37:53.267 --> 00:37:55.193
And I have a photo shoot today.

642
00:37:58.600 --> 00:37:59.810
I tried to reschedule

643
00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:02.623
and the photographer
is in town for one day.

644
00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:06.293
Babe. you're gonna be late.

645
00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:09.883
Very late.

646
00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.038
- Somebody borrowed this.

647
00:38:17.871 --> 00:38:18.704
Gross.

648
00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:24.875
Bitch.

649
00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:40.133
Hey. can I see that?

650
00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:42.933
Whoa.

651
00:38:44.403 --> 00:38:45.236
Maybe not.

652
00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:57.350
We need some help today.

653
00:38:57.350 --> 00:38:58.183
- Yeah.

654
00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:38.660
- All right. listen.

655
00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:41.450
This is all about relaxed luxury. yeah?

656
00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:42.793
Slouchy style.

657
00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:45.733
Like all of this belongs to you. yeah?

658
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:47.743
Sweetheart?

659
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:50.193
Am I addressing the living?

660
00:39:51.092 --> 00:39:53.102
- Yeah. I heard you.

661
00:39:53.102 --> 00:39:58.102
- All right. let's try something.

662
00:39:59.713 --> 00:40:01.092
Nice.

663
00:40:01.092 --> 00:40:02.592
Eyes on the prize.

664
00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:05.430
Okay.

665
00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:08.220
All right. here we go. Looking right here.

666
00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:11.302
Breathe through the mouth. Eyes. eyes!

667
00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:15.860
Okay.

668
00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:17.170
Let's try again.

669
00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:18.773
More confidence this time. yeah?

670
00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:22.993
All right. ready with
the eyes. One. two...

671
00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:27.133
What's going on?

672
00:40:28.262 --> 00:40:29.630
Did you sleep last night?

673
00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:30.620
- Yeah.

674
00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:32.550
- Well. it doesn't look like it.

675
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:34.572
- Well. I did. okay?

676
00:40:34.572 --> 00:40:35.522
- You're not fresh.

677
00:40:37.741 --> 00:40:38.791
Are you on something?

678
00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:43.340
Listen. sweetheart. it's real simple.

679
00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:46.093
You either pull your shit
together. or we're done.

680
00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:53.013
- Fuck off.

681
00:40:58.040 --> 00:40:59.480
- Hey. turn that shit off.

682
00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:00.813
Go on! Get out!

683
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:05.280
- Julian here. Welcome to my crib.

684
00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.073
Let's go meet my supermodel girlfriend.

685
00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:11.480
There are few creatures in nature

686
00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:13.603
as beautiful as the fashion model.

687
00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:17.143
Having migrated to the couch.

688
00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:22.690
she is calm. but still dangerous.

689
00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:26.710
Lucky for us. she's been sedated.

690
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:30.123
and shows little interest
in defending her territory.

691
00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:33.780
Don't touch me.

692
00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:36.563
Who pissed in
your Cheerios?

693
00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:38.863
Just go away.

694
00:41:40.102 --> 00:41:41.804
Are you for real?

695
00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:46.223
Oi. you should get that.

696
00:41:47.273 --> 00:41:49.530
I can't.

697
00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:50.867
Well. you better.

698
00:41:52.614 --> 00:41:55.320
Liv.

699
00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:56.700
- Fine.

700
00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:59.673
I've been calling for
over an hour. Where are you?

701
00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:03.770
- I'm at home. I don't feel well.

702
00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:05.080
You better be dying. Olivia.

703
00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:06.930
after what you pulled today.

704
00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:09.150
My girls don't walk off set like that.

705
00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:12.410
Patrick thinks you have a
drug problem. you know that?

706
00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:14.760
If Biggest Night hears
that kind of talk. it...

707
00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:17.713
- Hello?

708
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:19.623
Karen?

709
00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:23.000
Shit. it's dead.

710
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.720
Give me your phone.

711
00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:25.780
I'm using it to-

712
00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:26.943
- Give it to me.

713
00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:33.293
Are we live right now?

714
00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:37.603
You went live without fucking telling me?

715
00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:47.810
I admit I made a mistake.

716
00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:49.633
I'm sorry.

717
00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:54.553
What can I do?

718
00:42:57.790 --> 00:43:01.060
Come on. you can't bloody
kill me over one mistake.

719
00:43:07.141 --> 00:43:07.974
- Why not?

720
00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:51.683
- Front door.

721
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:13.327
Hello?

722
00:46:46.468 --> 00:46:47.968
Hello. Jules here.

723
00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:52.110
Many of you have commented about Olivia's

724
00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:53.993
lack of activity on this channel.

725
00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:59.510
On Friday. she got some very
bad news and it turns out

726
00:46:59.510 --> 00:47:01.750
she will not be going to
Hong Kong for the show.

727
00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:04.800
At this point. all I can do is support her

728
00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:07.563
and I will continue to support her.

729
00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:12.600
Ironically. this channel is
now our only source of income.

730
00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:15.140
so we will. even though it's difficult.

731
00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:18.683
continue to stream and create content.

732
00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:22.530
but we appreciate your
understanding in this.

733
00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:23.363
Cheers.

734
00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:37.837
Babe! Are you all right?

735
00:47:37.837 --> 00:47:38.925
Liv.

736
00:47:38.925 --> 00:47:41.026
Darling. what's going on?

737
00:47:47.557 --> 00:47:48.990
- I'm fine.

738
00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:53.020
Really. I mean. it could be the
birth control. the stress...

739
00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:57.390
- So. she's okay and
the bleeding's stopped.

740
00:47:57.390 --> 00:48:00.330
They gave her a diazepam. so
she's much more relaxed now.

741
00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:02.490
and we're waiting on a few
more tests to come back.

742
00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:06.565
but it does look like this
was just stress related.

743
00:48:09.866 --> 00:48:11.474
I know.

744
00:48:14.354 --> 00:48:17.910
So. her tests look okay.

745
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:20.430
She was dehydrated and her
glucose levels were low.

746
00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:22.420
but she'll be able to go home tonight.

747
00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:24.613
- Really? You don't need
to keep her overnight?

748
00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:28.450
- Do you know how she got those bruises?

749
00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:30.003
She said at the gym.

750
00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:32.360
- Hm.

751
00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:33.950
We're gonna put in a
referral for counseling

752
00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:36.200
and also a follow up
with her gynecologist.

753
00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:39.590
In the meantime. make sure she
has enough to eat and drink.

754
00:48:39.590 --> 00:48:41.130
Maybe you could cook for her.

755
00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:41.963
Sure.

756
00:48:41.963 --> 00:48:44.270
- That could be something
you could do. so.

757
00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:45.850
I'll be back with her paperwork.

758
00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:47.540
- Great. thank you.
- All right.

759
00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:06.860
A little bit of
comfort Alfredo going here.

760
00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:08.430
Just gotta whack a bit more cheese on it

761
00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:09.580
and I think we're good.

762
00:49:10.471 --> 00:49:11.753
Yeah. easy peasy.

763
00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:22.613
Liv! Come here. you've gotta try this.

764
00:49:30.693 --> 00:49:31.667
What're you doing?

765
00:49:31.667 --> 00:49:34.603
I made us a bit
of food. Here. give it a try.

766
00:49:36.163 --> 00:49:38.400
Just hold on. Let me get your reaction.

767
00:49:40.454 --> 00:49:43.203
- You know I can't eat that.

768
00:49:43.203 --> 00:49:45.240
- I just figured now. maybe.

769
00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:47.460
you know. you could just
have a few bites now?

770
00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:48.560
- It smells like shit.

771
00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:02.054
Babe?

772
00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:07.960
Babe. you've been in
there for over an hour.

773
00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:14.623
I'm sorry about the
food. About what I said.

774
00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:20.774
You should know. I'm just
trying to take care of you.

775
00:50:31.374 --> 00:50:34.302
I spoke to Rasto about the rat traps.

776
00:50:34.302 --> 00:50:36.523
He's gonna be coming by later.

777
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:48.463
Right.

778
00:50:51.669 --> 00:50:54.002
Well. I'll just be out here.

779
00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:06.060
Let's see if we can
cheer her up with a robe.

780
00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:11.201
There it is.

781
00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:15.023
That's not possible.

782
00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:25.534
No shit.

783
00:51:27.733 --> 00:51:29.937
Oh. this is fucked.

784
00:51:35.996 --> 00:51:37.163
Wait a second.

785
00:51:45.166 --> 00:51:46.249
What is this?

786
00:52:01.873 --> 00:52:03.853
All right. let's finish this.

787
00:52:23.303 --> 00:52:25.392
This is
a very special beauty.

788
00:52:25.392 --> 00:52:28.254
This is Valya. from Kiev.

789
00:52:28.254 --> 00:52:30.254
- My god. she is... Wow.

790
00:52:32.570 --> 00:52:35.024
She just
take a bath for you.

791
00:52:35.024 --> 00:52:36.357
Fresh and clean.

792
00:52:37.766 --> 00:52:40.224
It's nice to meet you.

793
00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:45.287
What is she doing?

794
00:52:52.275 --> 00:52:53.442
- No. not yet.

795
00:52:54.925 --> 00:52:58.675
We have ways of putting
her in a better mood.

796
00:53:00.222 --> 00:53:01.055
Rasto?

797
00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:02.973
Bring the box.

798
00:53:04.294 --> 00:53:05.711
Rasto?

799
00:53:12.814 --> 00:53:14.232
- She speaks German?

800
00:53:14.232 --> 00:53:16.574
Valya.

801
00:53:16.574 --> 00:53:18.752
I want her.

802
00:53:18.752 --> 00:53:20.592
No!

803
00:53:27.991 --> 00:53:31.752
You're never
coming out. you hear me? Never!

804
00:53:38.443 --> 00:53:40.552
That's our bloody mannequin.

805
00:53:40.552 --> 00:53:41.385
- Valya?

806
00:53:44.643 --> 00:53:45.476
Stop!

807
00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:49.480
Liv! Get out!

808
00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:51.290
You've gotta see this!

809
00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:52.702
Liv.

810
00:53:54.484 --> 00:53:55.770
Did you hear me?

811
00:53:58.780 --> 00:54:00.237
Wait. Don't get out.

812
00:54:10.673 --> 00:54:14.625
- Front door.

813
00:54:14.625 --> 00:54:19.625
- Was that you?

814
00:54:21.023 --> 00:54:21.856
Liv?

815
00:54:22.804 --> 00:54:25.705
- Front door.

816
00:54:25.705 --> 00:54:27.295
Liv?

817
00:54:27.295 --> 00:54:29.774
Liv!

818
00:54:30.636 --> 00:54:32.870
Armed stay.

819
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:33.703
- Shit.

820
00:54:36.273 --> 00:54:39.010
I just uploaded
something very disturbing

821
00:54:39.010 --> 00:54:41.340
and I'm not sure what to make of it.

822
00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:42.173
If you've seen it.

823
00:54:42.173 --> 00:54:44.890
then you know I've been
locked out of my flat.

824
00:54:44.890 --> 00:54:48.073
Whatever's going on with
Liv. it's getting worse.

825
00:54:50.050 --> 00:54:52.370
I feel like I just need
to get her out of there.

826
00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:54.220
but I don't know how.

827
00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:57.213
Short of practically kidnapping her.

828
00:54:59.541 --> 00:55:03.208
Either way. I guess I'm
gonna figure it out.

829
00:58:14.556 --> 00:58:16.054
- Thanks for coming.

830
00:58:16.054 --> 00:58:19.387
- Are you okay?
- I don't know. it's bad.

831
00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:24.070
That's my bloody building.
- October 20th. 1991.

832
00:58:24.070 --> 00:58:25.020
- Let me see that.

833
00:58:26.747 --> 00:58:29.060
"FBI officials have released the names

834
00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:31.800
of two Ukrainian women who were rescued

835
00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:34.980
from a former coat factory
in Lower Manhattan.

836
00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:38.480
Tatiana Somova and Darya Bukareva."

837
00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:41.110
- Is there anything
about a Valya in there?

838
00:58:41.110 --> 00:58:42.803
- No. just Tatiana and Darya.

839
00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:45.360
- What if she didn't make it out?

840
00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:47.610
- I didn't find any record of Valya.

841
00:58:47.610 --> 00:58:48.760
Maybe she escaped?

842
00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:50.270
- Maybe her ass is up there haunting her.

843
00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:52.590
- There's definitely
something up there with her.

844
00:58:52.590 --> 00:58:54.360
- Everything Liv is experiencing.

845
00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:56.850
depression. insomnia. anger.

846
00:58:56.850 --> 00:58:59.995
These are all symptoms of residual energy.

847
00:58:59.995 --> 00:59:01.803
What is that?

848
00:59:01.803 --> 00:59:03.620
- When a traumatic event occurs.

849
00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:06.650
it leaves a powerful imprint
on the place it happens.

850
00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:09.130
These negative feelings.
like Valya's rage.

851
00:59:09.130 --> 00:59:11.650
persist long after the incident itself.

852
00:59:11.650 --> 00:59:13.780
Now. I'm not sure what
lingers in that apartment.

853
00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:16.903
but it's strong enough
pull Liv down with it.

854
00:59:18.503 --> 00:59:21.223
- Front door.

855
00:59:21.223 --> 00:59:22.060
- Hello?

856
00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:23.460
That's the Super.

857
00:59:25.562 --> 00:59:27.062
- Is anybody home?

858
00:59:28.350 --> 00:59:29.210
I have those traps.

859
00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:30.790
- If he's in there. the door's unlocked.

860
00:59:30.790 --> 00:59:33.063
Our best chance is to go. now.

861
00:59:39.130 --> 00:59:40.400
We're going home.

862
00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:41.233
What?

863
00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:45.210
- You need me to make some
phone calls. get a locksmith?

864
00:59:45.210 --> 00:59:46.230
No problem.

865
00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:49.020
You need some food or a
place to stay? I got you.

866
00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:53.120
But this? No. I'm sorry. I'm
not going back in that place.

867
00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:54.610
- You're bullshit. you know that?

868
00:59:54.610 --> 00:59:56.910
You act tough until it's
time to do something.

869
01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:05.740
What do we do?

870
01:00:07.410 --> 01:00:08.960
- You ever made a sage bonfire?

871
01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.860
- Is it live?
- Yeah.

872
01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:15.460
I'm Julian Nash.

873
01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:17.020
The purpose of this live video

874
01:00:18.010 --> 01:00:20.140
is to document what's happening.

875
01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:22.692
I'm here for Olivia and that's it.

876
01:00:22.692 --> 01:00:24.092
I'm not leaving without her.

877
01:00:25.674 --> 01:00:27.007
Do mine.

878
01:00:28.666 --> 01:00:29.499
All right.

879
01:00:29.499 --> 01:00:31.480
- My name is Mia Kai.

880
01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:34.790
I'm going live today to help
a friend that is unwell.

881
01:00:34.790 --> 01:00:37.197
As an empath. I'll use my
gifts to cleanse both her

882
01:00:37.197 --> 01:00:40.070
and this apartment of negative energy.

883
01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:43.673
invoking the protection
of healing light and love.

884
01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:46.680
Ready?

885
01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:48.684
Yeah. let's go.

886
01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:55.633
- Lights?

887
01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:58.638
No. there's nothin'.

888
01:00:58.638 --> 01:01:00.038
- Liv?

889
01:01:00.038 --> 01:01:02.379
Olivia. darling.

890
01:01:02.379 --> 01:01:04.879
Where's the mannequin?

891
01:01:12.184 --> 01:01:15.434
- What was that?
- I'm right behind you.

892
01:01:49.245 --> 01:01:50.745
- There's nothin'.

893
01:02:03.025 --> 01:02:03.858
Olivia!

894
01:02:12.091 --> 01:02:13.091
What's this?

895
01:02:16.824 --> 01:02:21.074
What the...

896
01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:26.053
Oh. thank god. Olivia.

897
01:02:29.852 --> 01:02:32.185
Come closer.

898
01:02:36.550 --> 01:02:40.263
I ask to be surrounded
with divine white light.

899
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:45.173
and call on angels to support
me and come to my aid.

900
01:02:51.848 --> 01:02:54.227
Are you fucking kidding me?

901
01:02:59.177 --> 01:03:02.713
- You should clear your
mind. Anger makes it worse.

902
01:03:06.416 --> 01:03:08.166
All right.

903
01:03:09.810 --> 01:03:11.600
- Negativity of this sacred space.

904
01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:13.670
I banish you by light of grace.

905
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:16.060
You have no hold or power here.

906
01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:18.033
I stand and face you with no fear.

907
01:03:20.986 --> 01:03:24.251
Armed stay.

908
01:03:24.251 --> 01:03:25.430
Damn it!

909
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:27.520
Be gone forever. you will obey.

910
01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:29.598
From this space. you must away.

911
01:03:31.859 --> 01:03:34.348
- Fuck!

912
01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:38.033
What?

913
01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:42.323
- This isn't residual energy.

914
01:03:43.368 --> 01:03:45.390
We can relight it. yeah?

915
01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:47.290
We've still got the candles. the salt.

916
01:03:48.370 --> 01:03:49.853
- I'm making things worse.

917
01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:54.030
- You said you could fix this.

918
01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:55.380
You could remove the stain.

919
01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:59.560
- I'm sorry. I don't think
this was a good idea. I. I-

920
01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:03.130
No. no. no! No.
Mia. I know she's here.

921
01:04:03.130 --> 01:04:04.180
We've gotta find her.

922
01:04:05.062 --> 01:04:06.460
I can feel it.

923
01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:07.710
- I sense something else.

924
01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:10.290
- Well. you were wrong about the energy.

925
01:04:10.290 --> 01:04:12.150
Maybe you're wrong about this.

926
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:14.777
Listen. we've gotta do this.
Please. Mia. I'm asking you.

927
01:04:14.777 --> 01:04:16.853
I'm fucking begging you. Don't give up.

928
01:04:33.764 --> 01:04:34.812
Mia. what...

929
01:04:57.443 --> 01:05:00.606
Please. Mia. open the door.

930
01:05:27.850 --> 01:05:30.958
- Baby. what's wrong?
You're acting so strange.

931
01:05:30.958 --> 01:05:31.791
What?

932
01:05:31.791 --> 01:05:33.973
- Hold on. Let me get a
shot of your reaction.

933
01:05:35.070 --> 01:05:36.173
- No. don't do that.

934
01:05:37.310 --> 01:05:38.680
You're not Olivia.

935
01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:41.653
I'm your little monkey.
Don't you love me anymore?

936
01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:44.050
- Christ. what is this?

937
01:05:44.050 --> 01:05:46.333
- I took a bath but now
I'm all dirty again.

938
01:05:47.538 --> 01:05:49.938
Help me clean up this
mess and then come to bed.

939
01:05:50.910 --> 01:05:51.743
- What?

940
01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:54.663
- I gotta go.

941
01:05:55.930 --> 01:05:57.849
Someone's coming.
- What?

942
01:05:57.849 --> 01:05:59.333
Who? Who's coming?

943
01:06:01.429 --> 01:06:02.262
Mia.

944
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:10.940
- She's here.

945
01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:12.020
I saw her face.

946
01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:14.536
Is she all right? Is she hurt?

947
01:06:14.536 --> 01:06:16.910
- Front door.

948
01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:18.650
- You should go. now.

949
01:06:18.650 --> 01:06:20.749
No. I've gotta help her!

950
01:06:20.749 --> 01:06:22.046
- Don't.

951
01:06:30.746 --> 01:06:32.845
No.

952
01:06:36.067 --> 01:06:37.084
No.

953
01:06:37.084 --> 01:06:40.697
No. somebody! Somebody open the door.

954
01:06:40.697 --> 01:06:41.530
No.

955
01:06:49.683 --> 01:06:52.104
Somebody please open the door!

956
01:06:59.053 --> 01:06:59.886
Okay.

957
01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:09.850
Do not be alarmed.

958
01:07:09.850 --> 01:07:14.100
We are experiencing a
temporary power interruption.

959
01:07:31.095 --> 01:07:32.178
Shit.

960
01:07:41.322 --> 01:07:42.879
Come on.

961
01:07:42.879 --> 01:07:43.962
Light. light.

962
01:08:00.523 --> 01:08:03.041
Oh. no.

963
01:08:03.041 --> 01:08:05.214
Oh. please. please.

964
01:08:05.214 --> 01:08:06.582
Please.

965
01:08:06.582 --> 01:08:09.842
This elevator is full.

966
01:09:34.850 --> 01:09:36.427
Oh. god.

967
01:09:36.427 --> 01:09:41.317
Oh. god.

968
01:09:41.317 --> 01:09:42.650
Did you see her?

969
01:09:49.206 --> 01:09:50.373
Hold on. mate.

970
01:09:52.966 --> 01:09:55.029
I'll be right back.

971
01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:14.603
What is that?

972
01:10:19.048 --> 01:10:21.298
I'm here.

973
01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:46.518
Bloody hell.

974
01:11:48.757 --> 01:11:49.590
Olivia?

975
01:12:03.384 --> 01:12:04.217
Christ.

976
01:12:05.123 --> 01:12:06.123
Bloody hell.

977
01:12:58.649 --> 01:13:00.868
Oh. they locked her in here.

978
01:13:00.868 --> 01:13:03.451
That's why she was never found.

979
01:13:08.878 --> 01:13:10.060
Valya?

980
01:13:25.401 --> 01:13:29.484
God. if you're there.
please help me find Olivia.

981
01:14:01.572 --> 01:14:03.191
God.

982
01:15:10.210 --> 01:15:11.733
911 emergency.

983
01:15:11.733 --> 01:15:14.937
- Trapped in my flat and I'm bleeding.

984
01:15:17.515 --> 01:15:20.645
- Hello?

985
01:15:20.645 --> 01:15:21.478
- What?

986
01:15:32.187 --> 01:15:34.217
If you'd like to
make a call. please hang up.

987
01:15:35.555 --> 01:15:38.633
If you need help. hang up
and then dial your operator.

988
01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:49.423
- If anyone can see this.
I'm at 235 East Third Street.

989
01:15:50.707 --> 01:15:51.540
Flat 914.

990
01:15:55.950 --> 01:15:56.910
To my mum...

991
01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:01.723
I'm sorry.

992
01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:05.653
Sorry I'm not there with you.

993
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:10.900
To Liv's family...

994
01:16:14.795 --> 01:16:18.377
I'm sorry I didn't take
better care of your daughter.

995
01:16:23.654 --> 01:16:25.904
Just wanted to do something

996
01:16:28.894 --> 01:16:30.263
to make you proud of me.
