3
00:02:59.816 --> 00:03:00.733
- Get back.

4
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.753
- Hey!

5
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.573
Wait!

6
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.713
Ben.

7
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.116
Please. I don't have any money!

8
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.130
- Stop. stop.
- What?

9
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.220
He's not infected.

10
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.880
What the hell are you doing?!

11
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.126
You trying to get yourself killed?!

12
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.250
- Shut up.

13
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.083
You're okay.

14
00:03:49.133 --> 00:03:50.390
- What are you doing?
- Ben.

15
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.545
No. I wanna know

16
00:03:51.595 --> 00:03:52.514
what's going on.

17
00:03:54.936 --> 00:03:56.187
- No!

18
00:03:56.237 --> 00:03:57.296
Ben!
- Come on!

19
00:03:57.346 --> 00:03:58.618
There's more of them!
- Let go of me!

20
00:03:58.642 --> 00:03:59.576
- Come on!

21
00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:02.689
Come on!
- No!

22
00:04:38.071 --> 00:04:38.854
No! No!

23
00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:41.322
No!

24
00:04:41.372 --> 00:04:42.205
No!

25
00:05:17.679 --> 00:05:18.512
Come on!

26
00:05:50.434 --> 00:05:52.260
Hey. food's here.

27
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.386
- Hey. what'd you get?

28
00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.210
Lisa?

29
00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.320
What's going on?

30
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.766
Where's Ben? Lisa. what's going on?

31
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.590
Lisa. what happened?

32
00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.440
And who's this asshole?

33
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.500
He could be infected. We don't
even know who this guy is.

34
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:09.499
He doesn't look infected.

35
00:06:09.523 --> 00:06:10.663
I woke up on a beach and then I-

36
00:06:10.687 --> 00:06:13.040
- You woke up on a beach?

37
00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.880
Congratulations. this
guy's a complete psycho.

38
00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.603
Sam. Ben's dead.

39
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.180
Great.

40
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:21.330
Shit.

41
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.163
What happened?

42
00:06:22.213 --> 00:06:24.190
Can't believe I left him.

43
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.190
Sweetheart. it's gonna be okay.

44
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.913
Hey.

45
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.130
- You might as well come in
and like. you know. join us.

46
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.593
We've got a spare chair.

47
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.820
Come with me.

48
00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.980
I've got a
footprint. Possible target.

49
00:07:20.938 --> 00:07:22.640
He can't be more than 30K on foot.

50
00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.837
Get Ricky sorted. and send the UAV.

51
00:07:24.887 --> 00:07:26.954
And get straight on the line to the FOB.

52
00:07:27.004 --> 00:07:28.033
Copy that.

53
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:30.840
Don't worry about them.

54
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:33.100
It's just been a while
since we've met anyone new.

55
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:34.150
- I didn't kill him.

56
00:07:35.658 --> 00:07:36.467
I didn't think you had.

57
00:07:36.491 --> 00:07:37.650
Handing out keys?

58
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.110
- Sam!
- What?!

59
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:39.960
You expect me-

60
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:41.620
Look. why don't you sit down?

61
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.080
Into my house?

62
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.010
Where is he gonna stay. huh?

63
00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.787
Well. he's not staying in my room.

64
00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.723
- So you really don't know about anything?

65
00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.733
Okay. let's start with an
easy one. What's your name?

66
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:01.653
- Dan.

67
00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:03.363
- I'm Kate.

68
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:10.170
- How did this happen?

69
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:12.663
- Look. you should sit down.

70
00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:15.368
- Who is this guy?!

71
00:08:15.418 --> 00:08:18.086
- Shh. it's gonna be fine.
- Huh?!

72
00:08:18.136 --> 00:08:21.770
I mean. he wakes up on a
beach without any memory.

73
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.000
Does anybody believe that?

74
00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:23.883
Sam.

75
00:08:27.091 --> 00:08:29.187
- Who does he think he is? Jason Bourne?

76
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:34.793
- There was some sort
of neurological virus.

77
00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:39.110
Everyone thought it was just
the usual media hype. you know.

78
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.813
No one expected it to
wipe out half the country.

79
00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.210
By the time everyone
realized. it was too late.

80
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:49.680
Um.

81
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:51.650
I'm sorry. I'm not
really used to explaining

82
00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:52.893
this stuff to people.

83
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:56.110
Is there anything you do remember?

84
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:01.936
- Were you followed? Did you look?

85
00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.060
Did you look? Did you check for soldiers?

86
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:05.370
Did you see any?

87
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.870
You know. we're not supposed to be here.

88
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.603
The whole house is in danger now.

89
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:15.243
Hey. Sorry.

90
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:21.900
- So how does this virus spread?

91
00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.430
- Well. that's the thing. no one knows.

92
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.556
If you've survived this long.

93
00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.130
you must be immune like we are.

94
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.333
- You the only ones left?

95
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:35.763
- Most people evacuated to the safe camps.

96
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.060
if they managed to make
it out of the city.

97
00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.880
I went in the car with
my dad and my sister.

98
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.000
Just trying to get out like everyone else.

99
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:54.020
People were running into
the roads and screaming

100
00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:57.913
and attacking each other
and attacking the cars.

101
00:09:58.830 --> 00:09:59.903
And then. um.

102
00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:07.133
one of them fell in
front of our car and. um.

103
00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:17.010
my dad got out and tried to help.

104
00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.820
I heard him shout to my
sister to get back in the car.

105
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.610
but they were everywhere.

106
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.803
Then I just heard my sister screaming.

107
00:10:25.805 --> 00:10:26.972
I didn't move.

108
00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:30.133
I didn't do anything.

109
00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.840
Sorry. you didn't need to
hear any of that stuff.

110
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:39.173
You probably need to get some rest.

111
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:43.100
You can take my room if you like.

112
00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.180
Thank you.

113
00:11:04.141 --> 00:11:06.000
Dan?

114
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:06.883
Dan?

115
00:11:41.019 --> 00:11:42.590
Oh. I'm hungry now.

116
00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.672
- Sam.
- Hey. James. check this out.

117
00:11:45.755 --> 00:11:47.480
- Oh. that's easy.
- Hey.

118
00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:51.030
- Amateur.

119
00:11:55.963 --> 00:11:58.413
Talk about a conversation killer.

120
00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.943
All right. James. upstairs.

121
00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:29.142
Turn the music off.

122
00:12:55.058 --> 00:12:55.891
- Bang.

123
00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.693
All right. come on.

124
00:13:14.707 --> 00:13:15.540
Quickly.

125
00:13:31.712 --> 00:13:32.808
- Oh. fuck! Run!

126
00:13:44.461 --> 00:13:46.070
Guys. get out here!

127
00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.341
- James. shit!
- You're gonna be okay.

128
00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:53.189
Guys. get out here!

129
00:13:56.159 --> 00:13:58.031
I'm getting crushed!

130
00:13:58.081 --> 00:13:59.991
- All right. we're
gonna hae to let him in.

131
00:14:00.041 --> 00:14:01.807
Guys. get a sheet. We're
gonna have to let him in!

132
00:14:01.831 --> 00:14:02.640
- Go grab a sheet!
- Stay back!

133
00:14:02.664 --> 00:14:03.927
No! No!

134
00:14:05.096 --> 00:14:06.941
- James. you're gonna be okay.
- I've got the sheet!

135
00:14:11.321 --> 00:14:13.170
On the count of "three. two. one."

136
00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.540
everyone get out of the way!

137
00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:15.911
Ready?! Three!

138
00:14:15.961 --> 00:14:17.108
Two! One!

139
00:14:17.158 --> 00:14:17.941
Go!
- Go!

140
00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:21.633
Get him down!
- Lisa. where's that knife?!

141
00:14:21.683 --> 00:14:23.066
Where's that knife?!

142
00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:25.033
- Get him down!
- Oh. shit!

143
00:14:26.448 --> 00:14:27.977
Now!

144
00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:43.557
Someone give me a hand here?!

145
00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:14.733
Come on.

146
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:22.722
He's not
responding like the others.

147
00:15:22.746 --> 00:15:24.616
Not responding like the others.

148
00:15:24.666 --> 00:15:28.517
Up the dose to 20. Up the dose to 20.

149
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:31.192
He's starting to respond.

150
00:15:31.216 --> 00:15:33.040
- Dan?
- Starting to respond.

151
00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:34.870
Dan? Are you okay?

152
00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:35.956
Keep him
under full observation.

153
00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:37.231
Keep him under full observation.

154
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.040
J7 south
clear. Continue to B9 east.

155
00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:14.620
- Really got too fat.

156
00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:15.950
You know. even at this time.

157
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.250
you know. I'm okay.
- You've done really well.

158
00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.724
- Yeah. Well. I still do press-ups.

159
00:16:20.774 --> 00:16:23.597
- Whoa. whoa.

160
00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:33.600
- How's our guest? You
got your room back yet?

161
00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:36.431
- No. I think he's still
asleep. Come on. hurry up.

162
00:16:36.481 --> 00:16:38.470
- All right.
- I'm hungry.

163
00:16:45.075 --> 00:16:46.575
Clear.

164
00:16:52.716 --> 00:16:54.292
We have located the body

165
00:16:54.342 --> 00:16:56.592
of a Caucasian male at A12.

166
00:16:59.069 --> 00:17:04.069
It is not the target. I
repeat. it is not the target.

167
00:17:04.098 --> 00:17:04.973
Sending bio team

168
00:17:04.997 --> 00:17:07.210
to your location now to retrieve body.

169
00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.407
Copy that.

170
00:17:08.457 --> 00:17:10.915
Beta Team.
continue search of the sector.

171
00:17:37.868 --> 00:17:38.651
Huh?

172
00:17:38.701 --> 00:17:40.290
- Hey. Sam.

173
00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:41.420
Put your nuts away.

174
00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:42.356
I hurt my tooth.

175
00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.525
- You idiot.
- Why do you even eat those?

176
00:17:44.575 --> 00:17:47.380
Nuts are how you
get muscles like these.

177
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:48.485
You wouldn't understand.

178
00:17:48.535 --> 00:17:50.340
- Ho.
- Where are my cigarettes?

179
00:17:51.179 --> 00:17:52.740
Fucking hiding them from me.

180
00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:53.960
- That's my fucking weed tin.

181
00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:55.210
What the hell?!
- Fucking hell.

182
00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.250
Where are my cigarettes?

183
00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.243
- I don't know.

184
00:17:59.293 --> 00:18:01.430
You. you had them
last. Where are they?!

185
00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.662
Jesus.

186
00:18:02.712 --> 00:18:03.495
- Hey!

187
00:18:03.545 --> 00:18:04.863
- Fucking cigarettes!
- Hey. calm down.

188
00:18:04.887 --> 00:18:06.500
- I know he has them!
- Whoa. whoa.

189
00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:07.520
- Jesus Christ.
- One.

190
00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:08.990
I had one about half an hour ago.

191
00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:09.996
I put the rest of them back-

192
00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.038
Well. where are they now. then?

193
00:18:11.062 --> 00:18:11.871
I've looked everywhere.

194
00:18:11.895 --> 00:18:12.772
and they're nowhere!
- Guys. come on!

195
00:18:12.796 --> 00:18:13.996
What is wrong with you?

196
00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.286
Hey. what the hell are you doing?!

197
00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:17.653
You have them!
Just give them back!

198
00:18:17.703 --> 00:18:19.740
When the hell did
you become this strong?

199
00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:20.599
- Get off me. Sam!
- One.

200
00:18:20.623 --> 00:18:21.432
Whoa. whoa. Adi!

201
00:18:21.456 --> 00:18:22.776
That's enough!
- Fuck you. you prick!

202
00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:23.716
- I know you're my sister.

203
00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:26.030
but you do not talk to me like that!

204
00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.230
Please. calm down!

205
00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.290
I wanna let go of you.

206
00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:29.566
but stop struggling!

207
00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:30.413
Listen to me!

208
00:18:31.296 --> 00:18:32.860
Why are you acting like this?

209
00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:34.300
Give me my cigarettes!

210
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:36.180
Why are you lying to me?!

211
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:37.790
- No one's lying to you!

212
00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.150
Stop struggling!

213
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.283
Stop struggling.

214
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:48.880
- Thanks for that. by the way.

215
00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:49.996
Thought she was gonna have my bullocks

216
00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:51.170
off for a second there.

217
00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:53.873
- She's fine!

218
00:18:53.923 --> 00:18:54.776
She's just a little...

219
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.673
She's tense.

220
00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:58.560
- There's something definitely not right.

221
00:18:58.610 --> 00:18:59.730
- Kate's got a point.

222
00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.507
- What point does Kate have?!

223
00:19:06.105 --> 00:19:10.938
- I think maybe you need to
just have a chat or something.

224
00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:03.250
Hey.

225
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.100
- I really think you should go. Sam.

226
00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.273
- Your eyes.

227
00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.223
Can I see them?

228
00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:18.643
Get out.

229
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:20.483
Please.

230
00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:27.040
- How the fuck did this happen?

231
00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:28.690
- Get out!

232
00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.036
- Do you think she's turned?

233
00:20:30.086 --> 00:20:30.919
- No.

234
00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:34.150
She's not coping with it well.

235
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.500
She'll be fine. She just needs rest.

236
00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:37.383
- I hope so.

237
00:20:38.975 --> 00:20:39.808
- No!

238
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:43.540
- Just let me look at them. Let me see.

239
00:20:45.617 --> 00:20:46.769
- No!

240
00:20:48.799 --> 00:20:50.966
- Guys! Guys. get in here!

241
00:20:52.121 --> 00:20:54.099
She's infected.

242
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:56.012
Gotta get her arms.
- Okay.

243
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:02.814
- Adi. calm down. Please.

244
00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.170
Keep going.
- No!

245
00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:08.017
Stop!

246
00:21:08.067 --> 00:21:08.850
No!

247
00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:12.833
She's not moving anymore.

248
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:19.360
She's got a pulse.

249
00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:20.877
Help me carry her.

250
00:22:04.282 --> 00:22:06.380
- Is she ever gonna stop?

251
00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:07.263
- No.

252
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:10.780
- Can't we help her?

253
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:11.613
- What can we do?

254
00:22:11.663 --> 00:22:13.763
- There's only one way
to help her. isn't there?

255
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000
- If it was any one of us.
we know what he'd have done.

256
00:22:26.928 --> 00:22:28.608
And he would
have done it already.

257
00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:35.311
- Where are you going?

258
00:22:35.361 --> 00:22:37.528
- I'm going to the toilet.

259
00:24:06.088 --> 00:24:07.702
Come on!

260
00:24:08.635 --> 00:24:09.694
Stop!

261
00:24:09.744 --> 00:24:10.748
- Open the window!

262
00:24:10.772 --> 00:24:12.903
- Get her arm!
- Grab her arm!

263
00:24:50.919 --> 00:24:52.002
Sam.

264
00:24:53.849 --> 00:24:54.766
Let her go.

265
00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:28.517
- Good book.

266
00:25:28.567 --> 00:25:30.134
- Yeah. really good.

267
00:25:30.184 --> 00:25:32.937
- Yeah. really good. Really good.

268
00:25:32.987 --> 00:25:34.443
"Treasure Island." huh?

269
00:25:35.431 --> 00:25:36.277
- That's right.

270
00:25:56.484 --> 00:26:00.484
- Oh. almost.

271
00:26:02.886 --> 00:26:04.251
What's up. mate?

272
00:26:04.301 --> 00:26:05.629
- All right. Steven?

273
00:26:05.679 --> 00:26:07.704
Mm-hm.

274
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:46.740
- What are you doing?

275
00:26:49.238 --> 00:26:50.863
Oh. Sam. that's suicide.

276
00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:54.923
Come on. you can't go out there.

277
00:26:56.218 --> 00:26:58.068
- If I stay here. I'm gonna kill him.

278
00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:01.900
Just give it
a bit of time. okay?

279
00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:02.790
Wait...

280
00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:05.043
Shit.

281
00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:15.430
- Where's he gone?

282
00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:18.270
- Just gone out for a bit.

283
00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:19.153
- What?

284
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:28.790
Where's the food?

285
00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:30.373
We ate it. James.

286
00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.310
- We got nothing. then.

287
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:44.410
- Well. let's go get some.

288
00:27:45.481 --> 00:27:47.830
There's a Harburts
on the other side of town.

289
00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.890
- But look how far away
that is. We're here.

290
00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.586
So? We'll just
cut across Queen's Park.

291
00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:53.810
I mean. there's enough of us.

292
00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:54.669
- Cool. okay.
- I think I'll stay here

293
00:27:54.693 --> 00:27:56.073
and guard the house.

294
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:58.080
Um. Yeah. okay.

295
00:27:58.130 --> 00:27:59.950
- Mm.
- Let's do it.

296
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:00.926
- Fine. let's go.
- Okay.

297
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:02.440
Let's go.
- I don't like it.

298
00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:03.306
- I'm staying here.

299
00:28:03.356 --> 00:28:04.630
I'm not. I don't...

300
00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.660
I'm staying here.

301
00:28:56.533 --> 00:28:59.140

Permission to intercept.

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:04.510
Negative. 10-4.

305
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.760
We cannot risk the group dispersing.

306
00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:07.962
Wait for backup.

307
00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:09.981
- Why is it so quiet?

308
00:30:54.578 --> 00:30:55.840
Great. Now what?

309
00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:57.920
James. shut up.

310
00:30:57.970 --> 00:30:59.586
- Oh. come on. guys. We've
seen worse than that.

311
00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:01.296
Let's find another way in.

313
00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:48.720
Watch your line of fire.

Eye and ears. lads.

315
00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:11.460
There are some stairs over here.

316
00:33:11.501 --> 00:33:13.093
There's a staffroom this way.

317
00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:23.510
Soldiers.

318
00:33:28.601 --> 00:33:31.184
What are we gonna do?

319
00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.293
- We're gonna have to go this way.

320
00:33:36.906 --> 00:33:38.206
- Where are we gonna meet?

321
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:41.870

Exit east side. ground floor!

327

00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:14.470
No. Dan.

331
00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:15.620
Oh. it's not right.

332
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:16.887
We need it.

333
00:36:16.937 --> 00:36:19.020

Copy that. Out.

338
00:36:53.486 --> 00:36:55.403
Oh. fuck. Dan.

339
00:37:00.883 --> 00:37:02.370
- What you're asking me to do

340
00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:05.960
is risk everyone in here for them.

341
00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:08.600
- We have to go and find
them. They're our friends.

342
00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:10.703

343

Halt!

370
00:40:02.993 --> 00:40:05.136
- Shit.

371
00:40:05.186 --> 00:40:06.599
- Come on. Satch.

372
00:40:06.649 --> 00:40:08.425
Give me your hand. Come on.

373
00:40:19.371 --> 00:40:21.053
Target neutralized.

374
00:40:21.103 --> 00:40:22.354
Killed one. Be coming for tea now.

375
00:40:22.378 --> 00:40:23.211
Over.

376
00:40:28.791 --> 00:40:30.736
All units on standby.

377
00:40:30.786 --> 00:40:32.953
A group of unidentified...

378
00:40:47.939 --> 00:40:48.776
Oh. scratch that!

379
00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.867
Target's on the move.

380
00:40:50.917 --> 00:40:52.458
Oh. shit.
- Anyone in the area.

381
00:40:52.508 --> 00:40:55.003
please report.

382
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:43.343
Bravo 6.
what's your position? Over.

383
00:42:46.188 --> 00:42:47.639
Bravo 6. we didn't copy that.

384
00:42:47.689 --> 00:42:49.647
What's your position? Over.

385
00:43:57.233 --> 00:43:59.464
All units standby. Over.

386
00:43:59.514 --> 00:44:01.250
Can you repeat
last transmission? Over.

387
00:44:01.274 --> 00:44:03.640
- I repeat. Bravo 6 is down.

388
00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:05.190
All units standby.

389
00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:07.520
Roger that. Out.

390
00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:09.629
Audio Generator 3.

391
00:44:09.653 --> 00:44:11.076
wait for transport standing by.

392
00:44:11.126 --> 00:44:13.110
- On channel 7. please.

393
00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:15.389
This is a nav support channel only. Out.

394
00:44:15.439 --> 00:44:17.286
Copy that. Sorry. darling.

395
00:44:17.336 --> 00:44:19.970
- Romeo 0 niner to Hotel 1.

396
00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:21.800
We're losing visuals from the heli.

397
00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:23.840
heading west past Enterprise Point.

398
00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:26.243
Is there anyone on the ground? Over.

399
00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:29.930
Romeo 0
niner. continue search.

400
00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:32.403
Targets remain a priority.

401
00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:47.975
Why are they still chasing us?

402
00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:52.160
- Gonna have to wait for it to go past.

403
00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:53.423
Let's just stay put.

404
00:45:07.483 --> 00:45:09.055
All right. all right. Back. back.

405
00:45:09.105 --> 00:45:09.938
Get back.

406
00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:21.420
- Dan.

407
00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:22.303
- Fuck.

408
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:25.400
- The helicopter's following you.

409
00:45:29.350 --> 00:45:30.183
- Lisa.

410
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:37.790
We need to get out of the city.

411
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:44.583
Not that way.

412
00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:49.757
Come on. Arnie.

413
00:46:50.667 --> 00:46:52.350
- You guys take that one.

414
00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:53.377
I got this one.

415
00:47:26.981 --> 00:47:27.814
Get down.

416
00:47:33.155 --> 00:47:34.046
- We have to get another way around.

417
00:47:34.070 --> 00:47:35.893
- Yeah. we are.

418
00:47:55.850 --> 00:47:56.683
Back up.

419
00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:04.993
Pass me a stone.

420
00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:09.083
When I throw this. we run.

421
00:48:16.586 --> 00:48:18.186
- What was that?

422
00:48:20.976 --> 00:48:21.893
Go. go. go!

423
00:48:32.965 --> 00:48:35.465
Did you hear that?

424
00:48:39.687 --> 00:48:40.893
Ah. fucking seagulls.

425
00:49:06.830 --> 00:49:07.663
Guys.

426
00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:11.353
My feet really hurt.

427
00:49:15.923 --> 00:49:16.756
Whoa.

428
00:49:18.267 --> 00:49:20.240
Can see the whole city from here.

429
00:49:24.076 --> 00:49:26.867
I can't believe I dropped my glasses.

430
00:49:26.917 --> 00:49:28.500
You idiot.

431
00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:32.476
Look. is that our house?

432
00:49:32.526 --> 00:49:33.938
Where?

433
00:49:33.988 --> 00:49:34.833
Oh. yeah.

434
00:49:35.676 --> 00:49:36.676
There it is.

435
00:50:01.805 --> 00:50:03.670
- Did anyone get any food?

436
00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:05.570
- No. there's nothing left. remember?

437
00:50:11.168 --> 00:50:12.251
- I got some.

438
00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:21.643
Nice one. Dan.

439
00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:27.590
- Where'd all this come from?

440
00:50:34.565 --> 00:50:35.398
- Mm.

441
00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:43.240
These peas have artificial
coloring in them.

442
00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:45.963
Why do you need artificial
coloring in peas?

443
00:50:50.310 --> 00:50:53.010
Isn't there
anywhere safe outside the city?

444
00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:56.343
- My gran's got a place. up in Wilshire.

445
00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:58.763
Out in the country.

446
00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:02.117
Bit of a trek though.

447
00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:08.360
Attention. all units.

448
00:51:08.410 --> 00:51:10.830
We are executing Operation Snare Trap

449
00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:11.980
with immediate effect.

450
00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:17.950
We have failed to contain
and quarantine the city.

451
00:51:19.182 --> 00:51:23.170
The target and other known
contacts have not been located.

452
00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:25.220
We believe they may have traveled north.

453
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:29.603
We need to flush all infected
out of the city area.

454
00:51:30.682 --> 00:51:33.040
Widen the outer perimeter
by five kilometers.

455
00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:35.893
and prepare audio
generators for deployment.

456
00:51:37.442 --> 00:51:39.990
Assault teams prepare ambush positions.

457
00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:41.790
It is absolutely imperative

458
00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:44.812
that no one escapes past the perimeter.

459
00:51:44.862 --> 00:51:46.990
- Roger that. Bravo 2.
- Audio generator.

460
00:51:49.721 --> 00:51:51.591
Delta Team standing by.

461
00:51:51.641 --> 00:51:53.668
Standby and
wait for further orders.

462
00:51:53.718 --> 00:51:57.684
Audio Generator
2 heading toward section C12.

463
00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:30.140
All units. standby.

464
00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:33.363
Activating audio generator 5.
This thing better bloody work.

465
00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:39.740
- Can anyone else hear that?

466
00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:41.473
No.

467
00:52:45.183 --> 00:52:46.780
What are we listening for?

468
00:52:49.013 --> 00:52:50.352
What?

469
00:52:55.330 --> 00:52:56.860
- It's nothing. Let's go.

470
00:52:56.910 --> 00:52:57.743
Keep going.

471
00:53:02.770 --> 00:53:03.806
Shouldn't we be going that way?

472
00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:05.580
No. there's a safe camp there.

473
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:06.710
Besides. we're here.

474
00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:08.430
so we've gotta go straight down there.

475
00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:10.800
up the hill. through those trees.

476
00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:12.623
Really? Are you sure?

477
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.380
Hang on. Which hill?

478
00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:17.920
- Right.

479
00:53:17.970 --> 00:53:18.922
We came out here.

480
00:53:18.972 --> 00:53:20.076
so it's that one.
- They all look the same.

481
00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:20.890
- No. not at all.

482
00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:22.316
We've come out from this direction.

483
00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:24.580
so it's gotta be that one.

484
00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:26.136
I thought east was over there.

485
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:28.180
- No. no. no! It's gotta be this way!

486
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:29.996
We're heading northwest.
That's the whole point.

487
00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:31.680
We started east. then we go northwest

488
00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:32.736
for the rest of the journey.

489
00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:33.740
Look. trust me.

490
00:53:33.790 --> 00:53:34.910
James. we've been over

491
00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:37.650
this before.
- Oh. yeah. you're right.

492
00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:38.955
He's right.
- Oh. my god.

493
00:53:39.005 --> 00:53:40.125
- Yeah. well...

494
00:53:40.175 --> 00:53:41.296
Fuck.

495
00:53:41.346 --> 00:53:42.913
Fuck.

496
00:54:00.866 --> 00:54:02.152
Run! Don't look back!

497
00:54:02.202 --> 00:54:03.785
Oh. shit!

498
00:54:06.444 --> 00:54:07.227
Run!

499
00:54:29.368 --> 00:54:31.388
Hold your fire!

500
00:54:31.438 --> 00:54:32.221
Hold!

501
00:54:34.266 --> 00:54:35.477
Hold!

502
00:54:37.171 --> 00:54:38.004
Open fire!

503
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:50.927
Get down!

504
00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:07.335
Stay down! Just play dead!

505
00:55:59.550 --> 00:56:00.496
Come on! They've gone past.

506
00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:01.785
Let's move. now!

507
00:56:30.738 --> 00:56:35.024
Shit! Where
are they all coming from?!

508
00:56:35.074 --> 00:56:36.923
Fall back! There's too many!

509
00:56:36.973 --> 00:56:38.963
Delta Team. fall back!

510
00:56:39.013 --> 00:56:40.328
Run!

511
00:56:40.378 --> 00:56:42.797
- Retreat!
- Retreat to the RV. now!

512
00:56:42.847 --> 00:56:44.017
- Get outta there!
- Stupid!

513
00:57:06.624 --> 00:57:07.424
Retreat!

514
00:57:07.457 --> 00:57:08.830
You need to get the fuck...

515
00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:11.120
Oh. fuck. I don't
get paid enough for this shit!

516
00:57:11.144 --> 00:57:12.175
Move the fuck away!

517
00:57:12.199 --> 00:57:13.333
- Oh. for God's sakes!
- Move back!

518
00:57:13.357 --> 00:57:15.297
They're all around us.

519
00:57:15.347 --> 00:57:16.687
- Fall back!

520
00:57:16.737 --> 00:57:17.570
Run!

521
00:57:23.862 --> 00:57:24.789
Help me!

522
00:57:28.447 --> 00:57:29.697
Go!

523
00:57:36.159 --> 00:57:37.492
Come on.

524
00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:02.500
- Can we go to the pub now?

525
00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:09.367
- Come on. let's go.

526
00:58:31.781 --> 00:58:33.630
- Gotcha.

527
00:58:37.234 --> 00:58:38.633
Fall back. Fall back!

528
00:58:38.683 --> 00:58:39.963
- We're compromised.
- Fall back.

529
00:58:39.988 --> 00:58:41.470
- Retreat!

530
00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:42.329
Go. go. go!

531
00:58:42.353 --> 00:58:43.868
Go. go!
- Go!

532
00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:01.165
- This isn't safe.

533
00:59:01.215 --> 00:59:03.465
- What else are we gonna
do. freeze to death?

534
00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:12.123
- How slowly are reading that?

535
00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:15.433
Have we got any food left?

536
00:59:15.483 --> 00:59:16.320
Oi.

537
00:59:16.370 --> 00:59:17.950
Dan.
- Hm?

538
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.580
Food?

539
00:59:19.630 --> 00:59:20.940
- Um.

540
00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:22.240
Yeah. we might have some.

541
00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:26.953
Steven?

542
00:59:28.196 --> 00:59:29.363
Mm.

543
00:59:34.805 --> 00:59:35.638
- Beans?

544
00:59:51.330 --> 00:59:52.780
- Probably just some animals.

545
00:59:57.180 --> 00:59:58.013
Come on.

546
00:59:58.860 --> 00:59:59.910
Let's get some sleep.

547
01:00:28.594 --> 01:00:31.530
- He's not responding like the others.

548
01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:32.903
Up the dose to 20.

549
01:00:36.221 --> 01:00:38.421
He's starting to respond.

550
01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:43.343
Keep him under full observation.

551
01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:21.490
Morning. Hello?

552
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.060
Just anything
other than cold beans.

553
01:01:33.110 --> 01:01:34.448
Yeah. tell me about it.

554
01:01:34.498 --> 01:01:35.404
I used to be a chef. you know.

556
01:01:36.397 --> 01:01:37.180
A chef?

557
01:01:37.230 --> 01:01:38.730
You used to be a chef?

558
01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:39.949
- Yeah. well. I used to-
- What can you cook?

559
01:01:39.973 --> 01:01:40.929
Work in a couple of pubs.

560
01:01:40.953 --> 01:01:45.953
- Do you do quiche?

561
01:01:50.657 --> 01:01:53.200
Come on. Dan. Wee faster.

562
01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:54.500
Yeah. hurry up.

01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:10.330
You okay?

564
01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.700
Yeah. I'm fine.

565
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:14.650
You sure?

566
01:02:15.810 --> 01:02:16.643
Yeah.

567
01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:19.549
I don't know.

568
01:02:19.599 --> 01:02:20.770
I just...

569
01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:22.170
I don't know how to say it.

570
01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.120
When Lisa...

571
01:02:25.170 --> 01:02:26.446
Look. Dan. you can tell me.

572
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:27.670
I'm not gonna judge you.

573
01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:31.190
- I found my photo on
the body of a soldier.

574
01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:32.919
What?

575
01:02:32.969 --> 01:02:34.529
I think they're looking for me.

576
01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.330
They're following you?

577
01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:42.130
They're following you. you son of a bitch?

578
01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:43.273
- Sam.
- Huh?

579
01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:45.870
- Sam.
- Huh?

580
01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:46.769
Who the hell are you?!

581
01:02:46.793 --> 01:02:49.423
- Sam. don't do this.

582
01:02:49.473 --> 01:02:51.340
Just calm down.

583
01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:53.861
- Come on. who are you?!
- Sam. don't do this!

584
01:02:53.911 --> 01:02:55.465
What the fuck do you know?!

585
01:02:55.515 --> 01:02:57.513
- Sam. just let him talk.
- Down!

586
01:02:57.563 --> 01:02:59.044
Sam.

587
01:02:59.094 --> 01:03:00.765
Sam. let him talk.

588
01:03:00.815 --> 01:03:01.732
No.

589
01:03:02.625 --> 01:03:04.450
- Sam.

590
01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:06.740
Come on. Sam. leave
it. This isn't gonna help.

591
01:03:06.790 --> 01:03:08.202
- Fucking stay out of this. you prick.

592
01:03:08.226 --> 01:03:10.036
I'm gonna kick the shit out of him.

593
01:03:12.669 --> 01:03:13.742
Dan!

594
01:03:14.625 --> 01:03:15.739
- Dan. get off of him!
- Dan!

595
01:03:15.763 --> 01:03:17.501
- You're gonna kill him!

596
01:03:17.551 --> 01:03:19.710
Dan!

597
01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:20.911
- Leave him!

598
01:03:24.179 --> 01:03:24.962
- Come on.
- Dan!

599
01:03:25.012 --> 01:03:25.843
- Get off him!
- Dan!

600
01:03:25.893 --> 01:03:28.059
Let him go.

601
01:03:28.109 --> 01:03:30.110
- Get off!

602
01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:32.050
Like he could hurt me anyway.

603
01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:33.080
Enough.

604
01:03:33.130 --> 01:03:34.663
- No. not fucking enough!

605
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:38.170
Told you.

606
01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:39.380
Fucking told you.

607
01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:40.790
I told all of you this whole time.

608
01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:45.477
There's something about
him. and he's why Adi died.

609
01:03:48.270 --> 01:03:50.560
And he's why the military came.

610
01:03:50.610 --> 01:03:52.090
And I fucking said it.

611
01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:54.560
I fucking said it from day one!

612
01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:03.510
Didn't I?! Didn't I?!

613
01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:07.890
So what do you know?

614
01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:09.740
Are you just gonna be
honest now. and tell us?

615
01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:11.510
- I don't know anything.

616
01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:13.610
You don't know anything?

617
01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:16.113
Yeah. I've heard that one before.

618
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:19.900
- I don't know anything.

619
01:04:21.913 --> 01:04:24.023
I don't know why they're looking for me.

620
01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:30.723
Don't you ever
keep stuff from us again.

621
01:04:56.315 --> 01:04:57.791
- Steven!

622
01:05:01.143 --> 01:05:06.143
No!

623
01:05:08.823 --> 01:05:09.656
Steven.

624
01:05:20.921 --> 01:05:21.754
Steven.

625
01:05:23.170 --> 01:05:24.120
It's gonna be fine.

626
01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:27.510
Kate.

627
01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:28.800
You'll be fine.

628
01:05:28.850 --> 01:05:29.883
It's gonna be fine.

629
01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:33.530
I'm so sorry. guys.

630
01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:35.230
- No. you don't have to be sorry.

631
01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:39.243
- You'll be fine.

632
01:05:39.293 --> 01:05:41.752
He just came out of nowhere.

633
01:05:41.802 --> 01:05:42.974
I'm sorry.

634
01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:01.190
- You sure it's this way?

635
01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:05.100
- Do you want the map?

636
01:07:52.749 --> 01:07:53.832
Hey! Careful.

637
01:07:55.185 --> 01:07:56.518
Give me the gun.

638
01:08:07.783 --> 01:08:09.163
Tie him up. James.

639
01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:16.370
We have an
unconfirmed sighting of target

640
01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:19.180
and secondary targets just outside Zone 5.

641
01:08:19.230 --> 01:08:20.573
Bravo Team have lost
contact with their boy

642
01:08:20.597 --> 01:08:22.510
who reported the sighting.

643
01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:24.236
We're gonna have to move fast on this one.

644
01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:25.610
Shoot to kill!

645
01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:29.047
3 to Tango 2. We
are on approach to drop zone.

646
01:08:29.097 --> 01:08:30.213
ETA. four minutes.

647
01:08:31.130 --> 01:08:32.593
- Why are you looking for us?

648
01:08:33.850 --> 01:08:35.250
Why are you looking for him?

649
01:08:38.930 --> 01:08:40.530
Don't you fucking think I won't.

650
01:08:45.780 --> 01:08:47.233
- He was infected. all right?

651
01:08:50.590 --> 01:08:51.943
- He was infected?

652
01:08:54.851 --> 01:08:56.601
- He was given a prototype vaccine.

653
01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:02.033
It worked. and then he
escaped the research center.

654
01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:03.813
- Did he?

655
01:09:07.050 --> 01:09:08.250
- So what's the problem?

656
01:09:10.830 --> 01:09:12.126
- Look. right. in the other patients

657
01:09:12.150 --> 01:09:13.996
who were given the same cure.

658
01:09:14.046 --> 01:09:16.550
the virus just mutated or something.

659
01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.900
And now. it's 10 times worse.

660
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:21.210
Now. even the immune can be infected now.

661
01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:23.833
And you. you're still infected with it.

662
01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:27.578
And you can wipe out what's
left of this fucking country.

663
01:09:42.190 --> 01:09:43.990
- How do we know we're not infected?

664
01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:48.760
- Give it two weeks. mate.

665
01:10:00.265 --> 01:10:02.015
- Don't make a sound.

666
01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:13.603
Dan.

667
01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:19.033
- If I hand myself in.
will you let them go?

668
01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:37.943
- Come on.

669
01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:11.613
- Guys.

670
01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:19.930
What's up. Dan?

671
01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:25.050
- I'm gonna head back that way.

672
01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:26.863
see if we can draw some of them away.

673
01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:30.873
- Then what?

674
01:12:34.190 --> 01:12:35.753
- Catch up with you later. okay?

675
01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:40.273
- Dan. you can't lie to me.

676
01:12:53.177 --> 01:12:55.150
- I'll see you later.

677
01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:57.050
- Do what you gotta do. Jason Bourne.

678
01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:01.743
- Good luck.

679
01:13:12.885 --> 01:13:13.718
- No.

680
01:14:57.405 --> 01:14:58.238
- Oi!

681
01:14:59.623 --> 01:15:00.948
Over here. now!

682
01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:05.620
Get on your knees!

683
01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:10.712
It's not your lucky day. sunshine.

684
01:15:10.762 --> 01:15:12.880
Do you know how many men
have died looking for you?

685
01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:20.858
I'm gonna enjoy blowing
your fucking head off!
