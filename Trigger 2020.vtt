[gunshot]

00:03:29.034 --> 00:03:32.517
[suspenseful music]

6
00:03:44.793 --> 00:03:49.551
-Hmm! Look at you. Good
morning. Good morning.
-Good morning.

7
00:03:49.586 --> 00:03:51.724
-[phone buzzing]
-It's probably the office.

8
00:03:51.758 --> 00:03:54.034
-Yep. Got to go.
-Me. too.

9
00:03:54.068 --> 00:03:56.689
All right. our chef Frank
will be here at three p.m.

10
00:03:56.724 --> 00:03:59.862
to help you out. babe.
He comes highly recommended.

11
00:03:59.896 --> 00:04:03.448
Okay. Well.
I will be home by then.

12
00:04:03.482 --> 00:04:08.103
But remember you have
to call me Queen Vanessa.
And you have to play along.

13
00:04:08.137 --> 00:04:11.827
Alright. then. Queen Vanessa.
then I want to be called.
King Collin.

14
00:04:11.862 --> 00:04:14.448
Working Collin. do not be
late for dinner. Eight o'clock.

15
00:04:27.655 --> 00:04:28.448
[Vanessa chuckles]

16
00:04:46.137 --> 00:04:49.068
[uplifting music]

17
00:04:53.551 --> 00:04:56.827
So I told the guys if we're
going to start a polo club.

18
00:04:56.862 --> 00:04:58.034
that we can keep
the horses here.

19
00:04:58.068 --> 00:05:00.275
No! Baby. you're not riding

20
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.827
no damn horse with
a steak riding around.

21
00:05:03.862 --> 00:05:06.000
-Why not?
-Do you not remember
our first date?

22
00:05:06.034 --> 00:05:08.172
-What about our first date--
-[Vanessa laughs]

23
00:05:08.206 --> 00:05:10.689
Okay. I already know where you
are going. Don't even say it.

24
00:05:10.724 --> 00:05:13.206
-You know what happened.
-Oh. no. here you go.

25
00:05:13.241 --> 00:05:16.172
-[Vanessa chuckles] Okay.
Your hands...
-Mm-hmm.

26
00:05:16.206 --> 00:05:20.000
...were shaking like a baby's
legs learning how to walk.

27
00:05:20.034 --> 00:05:22.862
-[Collin laughs]
-It was so embarrassing.

28
00:05:22.896 --> 00:05:25.137
Why were you laughing
at me. huh?

29
00:05:25.172 --> 00:05:28.034
-You were so scared.
-[stutters] Well. yeah.

30
00:05:28.068 --> 00:05:31.000
I was scared. You see the teeth
on that horse? I thought it was
going to bite me.

31
00:05:31.034 --> 00:05:33.655
And then. you know.
you had that ice cream cone.

32
00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:35.827
-[both laughs]
-[Collin] Yeah.

33
00:05:35.862 --> 00:05:38.896
Yeah. and the ice cream
was all over the horse's back.

34
00:05:38.931 --> 00:05:42.827
I'm sure the horse appreciated
that ice cream cone falling on
his head.

35
00:05:42.862 --> 00:05:45.137
It was a hot day. Okay. So...

36
00:05:45.172 --> 00:05:46.620
-Anyway speaking of food.
-[Vanessa laughs]

37
00:05:46.655 --> 00:05:47.655
[bell ringing]

38
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.517
[Vanessa] Okay. [laughs]

39
00:05:55.551 --> 00:05:58.034
-Good evening.
Mr. and Mrs. Mass.
-Evening. Frank.

40
00:05:58.068 --> 00:06:00.275
-Hello.
-How are you?

41
00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.862
Tonight I have prepared for you
Peking duck.

42
00:06:02.896 --> 00:06:05.931
seared in a sesame seed oil.

43
00:06:05.965 --> 00:06:10.206
Seasoned with not one.
but five Chinese spices.
honey. brown sugar.

44
00:06:10.241 --> 00:06:14.620
and a dark soy sauce as well
as the hoisin sauce.
And as you can see

45
00:06:14.655 --> 00:06:18.172
there on your plate. there are
cucumber and Mandarin pancakes
to side with.

46
00:06:18.206 --> 00:06:19.689
-Sounds so good.
-[Collin] Mm-hmm.

47
00:06:23.793 --> 00:06:26.551
Oh. Frank. You are amazing.

48
00:06:26.586 --> 00:06:29.862
Welcome. sir. I will be in
the kitchen preparing dessert.

49
00:06:32.068 --> 00:06:33.862
-Enjoy your dinner.
-[both] Thank you.

50
00:06:38.241 --> 00:06:39.689
[Vanessa] Thank you
for doing this.

51
00:06:41.206 --> 00:06:44.689
-Doing what. dressing up?
-You're just. you're
just the best.

52
00:06:45.758 --> 00:06:47.724
[doorbell chimes]

53
00:06:47.758 --> 00:06:48.689
It's probably the neighbors.

54
00:06:52.586 --> 00:06:55.551
-All right.
it smells good. right?
-So good.

55
00:06:55.586 --> 00:06:57.896
-Did King Collin do well?
-You did well. King Collin.

56
00:06:57.931 --> 00:07:00.793
Oh. that's what I'm talking
about. Sounds good to me.

57
00:07:01.965 --> 00:07:04.965
Sir. sorry to interrupt.
uh. there's a man at the door

58
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.655
who says that he's your brother.

59
00:07:08.862 --> 00:07:13.000
-Michael?
-No. sir. It wasn't Michael.
He said his name was Trey.

60
00:07:14.758 --> 00:07:16.206
Is this a joke?

61
00:07:16.241 --> 00:07:18.068
Trey?

62
00:07:18.103 --> 00:07:19.931
Wait. wait. wait. wait. wait.

63
00:07:19.965 --> 00:07:23.206
Just in case it's a robber.
go and grab the gun.

64
00:07:23.241 --> 00:07:26.000
-We don't have a gun.
-Yes. we do.

65
00:07:26.034 --> 00:07:27.931
That's a nail gun.
And we don't even use it.

66
00:07:27.965 --> 00:07:30.000
[Vanessa laughs] Oops.

67
00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:41.586
-Trey?
-Collin.

68
00:07:43.103 --> 00:07:45.068
Relax. They just
released me today.

69
00:07:51.965 --> 00:07:53.068
Well. you said
in your last letter that

70
00:07:53.103 --> 00:07:55.241
you will be
getting out soon. but...

71
00:07:55.275 --> 00:07:56.655
I didn't know
it was going to be this soon.

72
00:07:58.862 --> 00:08:01.689
I ain't the pizza delivery man.
Are you going to let me in?

73
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:04.896
Oh. yeah. yeah. come on in.

74
00:08:09.862 --> 00:08:10.689
Wow!

75
00:08:12.206 --> 00:08:13.310
This is dope.

76
00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:19.000
Come on. come on in.
Have a seat.

77
00:08:23.172 --> 00:08:25.862
Ah. Hold on one second.
One second.

78
00:08:25.896 --> 00:08:28.172
[bell ringing]

79
00:08:28.206 --> 00:08:30.965
-[Frank] Yes. sir.
-Will you bring my brother
a plate. please?

80
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.827
Absolutely.

81
00:08:32.862 --> 00:08:35.827
-Oh. hi.
-So. how can we help you?

82
00:08:35.862 --> 00:08:37.034
[Collin laughs]

83
00:08:37.068 --> 00:08:39.034
Uh. baby. He. uh...

84
00:08:40.068 --> 00:08:42.137
Trey here. He-- he...

85
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:44.655
just got out of prison.

86
00:08:47.206 --> 00:08:50.137
We didn't know that
you were getting out tonight.

87
00:08:51.172 --> 00:08:54.310
Yeah. Yeah. Well. why didn't
you call? I'd have came and
picked you up.

88
00:08:54.344 --> 00:08:56.655
Well. I mean. I wanted
to surprise you guys.

89
00:08:57.724 --> 00:08:58.655
Surprise!

90
00:09:02.482 --> 00:09:05.103
I'm going to get out of here.
I don't want to interrupt
your dinner.

91
00:09:05.137 --> 00:09:08.965
Have a seat-- Just--
We've got plenty of food here.
you know...

92
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.896
You like duck?

93
00:09:10.931 --> 00:09:13.379
We have some Chinese sauce
and some dress--

94
00:09:13.413 --> 00:09:16.068
I don't even know what it is.
Our chef Frank will explain.

95
00:09:16.103 --> 00:09:18.103
-You want some?-I mean. I don't want to impose.

96
00:09:18.137 --> 00:09:19.275
I just stopped by to say hi.

97
00:09:21.241 --> 00:09:23.517
Don't be crazy. man.
Hold on a second.

98
00:09:23.551 --> 00:09:24.896
[bell ringing]

99
00:09:29.379 --> 00:09:31.068
-[Trey] Thank you.
-You're welcome. sir.

100
00:09:31.103 --> 00:09:32.241
Oh. you can call me Trey.

101
00:09:38.241 --> 00:09:41.103
-Honestly.
I'm shocked right now.
-You're shocked?

102
00:09:41.137 --> 00:09:44.344
-I'm shocked.
-I mean. how. like. where--

103
00:09:44.379 --> 00:09:47.206
How did you guys
get all this stuff?

104
00:09:47.241 --> 00:09:50.172
You guys got a butler...
named Frank?

105
00:09:50.206 --> 00:09:52.344
Well. he's a chef.

106
00:09:52.379 --> 00:09:55.379
I work in high-stake
investments as a broker.

107
00:09:55.413 --> 00:09:58.413
Vanessa is a dentist. we
did really well this last year.

108
00:09:58.448 --> 00:10:02.206
And we just bought this homeand I just got a huge promotion.

109
00:10:03.413 --> 00:10:07.379
Wow. I'm proud of you guys.
I'm happy for you. Honestly.

110
00:10:08.275 --> 00:10:12.379
-Vanessa. you are beautiful.
-So. where are you staying?

111
00:10:12.413 --> 00:10:16.103
Uh. I rented a room.
At a hotel.

112
00:10:16.137 --> 00:10:18.517
-That's good.
-What? Hotel?

113
00:10:18.551 --> 00:10:21.034
No. man. That's nonsense. man.

114
00:10:21.068 --> 00:10:23.103
You can stay here.
we've got plenty of room.

115
00:10:23.137 --> 00:10:25.103
We've got plenty of food.

116
00:10:25.137 --> 00:10:27.724
No. I don't want to--
I don't want to impose.

117
00:10:30.241 --> 00:10:31.206
Collin. let me talk to you
for a minute.

118
00:10:44.413 --> 00:10:47.379
-Wow. This is different.
-Oh. this is different?

119
00:10:47.413 --> 00:10:51.206
You just invited your brother tostay here on our special night.

120
00:10:51.241 --> 00:10:53.206
-[scoffs] But he's my brother.
-I'm your wife!

121
00:10:53.241 --> 00:10:55.827
-Babe. it's only one night.
-He's got a hotel.

122
00:10:55.862 --> 00:10:58.241
No. he doesn't. all right?
He doesn't have any money.

123
00:10:58.275 --> 00:11:00.448
He's probably staying
somewhere awful with

124
00:11:00.482 --> 00:11:03.000
people he doesn't even know.
or need to be around.

125
00:11:03.034 --> 00:11:04.413
And I'm not going to let him
do that when we have all this
space here.

126
00:11:04.448 --> 00:11:06.448
Give him some money.

127
00:11:06.482 --> 00:11:09.448
go. take him to a hotel.
but he cannot stay here.

128
00:11:09.482 --> 00:11:11.275
He just got out of prison
for ten years.

129
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:13.137
-I don't care.-I'm not just going to-- I'm not

130
00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:13.965
going to just kick him out.

131
00:11:14.965 --> 00:11:15.793
I don't care.

132
00:11:18.103 --> 00:11:19.103
He's my brother.

133
00:11:20.448 --> 00:11:21.275
Come over here.

134
00:11:22.965 --> 00:11:24.000
Come over here!

135
00:11:27.482 --> 00:11:30.482
He stays one night
and then he's gone.

136
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:37.103
[eerie music]

137
00:12:11.206 --> 00:12:13.379
Morning riser. huh?

138
00:12:13.413 --> 00:12:15.551
Yeah. prison will
do that to you.

139
00:12:16.551 --> 00:12:19.000
They try to keep the inmates
tired. so they don't have
the energy to lash out.

140
00:12:19.034 --> 00:12:19.862
Oh.

141
00:12:21.551 --> 00:12:26.068
Well. how does it feel
being out? Finally free.

142
00:12:26.103 --> 00:12:27.862
Feels like I can
finally breathe again.

143
00:12:29.206 --> 00:12:31.344
Remember when we're young
and Michael took us fishing?

144
00:12:31.379 --> 00:12:33.896
[chuckles] Yeah. that one time.

145
00:12:33.931 --> 00:12:36.068
We caught that big-ass catfish.
and everyone was too afraid

146
00:12:36.103 --> 00:12:37.379
to touch it
and take the hook out.

147
00:12:38.896 --> 00:12:42.172
I still can't eat fish
unless it looks nothing
like a fish on my plate.

148
00:12:42.206 --> 00:12:45.517
No skin. no bones.
and especially no face.

149
00:12:47.206 --> 00:12:51.034
-[Chuckles]
-When I was locked up.
I felt like that fish.

150
00:12:51.068 --> 00:12:52.551
Flapping around
on the ground suffocating.

151
00:12:54.344 --> 00:12:56.000
But now that I'm free...

152
00:12:57.241 --> 00:12:59.344
feels like I'm starting towork my way back into the water.

153
00:12:59.379 --> 00:13:00.620
like I can
finally breathe again.

154
00:13:04.275 --> 00:13:05.413
Did Michael ever talk to you?

155
00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:09.482
Once.

156
00:13:10.758 --> 00:13:13.965
Really? Wow.

157
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.931
He said the world has a way
of giving you what you deserve.

158
00:13:17.413 --> 00:13:20.965
[scoffs] I'm glad
you did though.

159
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.586
Your letters really
helped me get through the time.

160
00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:26.448
Yeah. I haven't seen
Mike in a long time either.

161
00:13:26.482 --> 00:13:29.896
Get this. He works for the
police department. Negotiator.

162
00:13:32.965 --> 00:13:34.965
Well. I'm happy for the both
of you guys for doing
something with your lives.

163
00:13:37.586 --> 00:13:39.896
Vanessa and I want to give
you some money so you can
get back on your feet.

164
00:13:41.068 --> 00:13:42.965
I'll be all right.

165
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.344
I got some money.Why are you being so nice to me?

166
00:13:46.379 --> 00:13:47.413
Just because
we got the same mom?

167
00:13:49.241 --> 00:13:50.206
We're blood.

168
00:13:53.551 --> 00:13:54.896
So you think I'm innocent then?

169
00:13:58.586 --> 00:14:00.448
-I'm going
get out of your hair.
-Hey. let me just.

170
00:14:00.482 --> 00:14:01.448
at least give you some money.

171
00:14:07.344 --> 00:14:08.448
I didn't kill our mom.

172
00:14:10.448 --> 00:14:11.965
-I want you to believe me.
-Trey.

173
00:14:12.793 --> 00:14:15.275
Trey. I wasn't there.

174
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:16.482
So I don't know what to believe.

175
00:14:19.068 --> 00:14:20.275
It doesn't even matter. man.
because I'm here now.

176
00:14:24.482 --> 00:14:26.137
I know you have nowhere to go.

177
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.275
You want some air. so you
don't feel like you're choking.

178
00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:30.310
Then take the money.

179
00:14:31.793 --> 00:14:32.620
All right.

180
00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:34.448
All right?

181
00:14:35.689 --> 00:14:38.448
What day was today?
Uh. today's Sunday.

182
00:14:38.482 --> 00:14:39.586
All right. look.
the banks are closed.

183
00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:43.103
So. just stay one more night.

184
00:14:43.137 --> 00:14:46.000
We head over in the morning.
We'll find you an apartment.

185
00:14:46.034 --> 00:14:48.482
I don't want my brother
staying in a motel. Sound fair?

186
00:14:50.275 --> 00:14:52.275
All right. I appreciate you.

187
00:15:06.206 --> 00:15:07.172
[Collin sighs]

188
00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.517
What the hell is
he still doing here?

189
00:15:10.551 --> 00:15:13.379
-It's 7 a.m.
-So he's leaving?

190
00:15:13.413 --> 00:15:15.103
Well. I got him
to accept the money.

191
00:15:15.137 --> 00:15:18.344
-And?
-And the banks are closed.
it's Sunday.

192
00:15:18.379 --> 00:15:20.724
Okay. So write him a check.

193
00:15:20.758 --> 00:15:24.724
-go to the ATM--
-What's wrong with him
being here one more night?

194
00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:26.758
-What's the problem?
-What is the problem?

195
00:15:26.793 --> 00:15:29.517
-Yeah. What's the problem?
-We are having people
over tonight.

196
00:15:29.551 --> 00:15:31.241
And to be honest with you.

197
00:15:31.275 --> 00:15:33.379
I don't want
a criminal in our home.

198
00:15:33.413 --> 00:15:35.724
Hey. They're not going to even
know he has a criminal past.

199
00:15:35.758 --> 00:15:38.413
What did he do?
Why did he go to jail?

200
00:15:38.448 --> 00:15:40.862
-That's his business.
-No. it's my business.

201
00:15:40.896 --> 00:15:42.758
I'm your wife.

202
00:15:42.793 --> 00:15:46.241
This is our house.
What did he go to prison for?

203
00:15:46.275 --> 00:15:47.758
I went to prison for
the murder of our mother.

204
00:15:59.724 --> 00:16:01.103
Is that true?

205
00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:04.586
That part is definitely true.

206
00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.862
-But--
-Look.

207
00:16:06.896 --> 00:16:08.620
I'm just going to
get out of you guys' way.

208
00:16:08.655 --> 00:16:10.275
Trey. Where are you going to go?

209
00:16:12.551 --> 00:16:16.551
-Doesn't matter.
-Trey. face it. all right?

210
00:16:16.586 --> 00:16:20.620
You-- you got no place to go.
no place to stay. We already
talked about this.

211
00:16:20.655 --> 00:16:22.758
Babe? He's already
staying in the guest room.

212
00:16:22.793 --> 00:16:24.793
One more night
is not going to hurt.

213
00:16:24.827 --> 00:16:28.206
He can look for an apartment.
keep to himself.

214
00:16:28.241 --> 00:16:30.137
We'll handle all this
in the morning. Please. for me?

215
00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:32.448
You're good with that?

216
00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:34.448
Yeah. I'm good.

217
00:16:35.862 --> 00:16:37.344
I'm going to go get
ready for tonight.

218
00:16:39.482 --> 00:16:40.655
We have the wine delivery
in an hour.

219
00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:51.827

220
00:17:07.551 --> 00:17:08.827
[doorbell chimes]

221
00:17:08.862 --> 00:17:09.896
Baby. they're here.

222
00:17:11.517 --> 00:17:13.586
Damn!

223

-Damn. Damn. Damn.
-[Vanessa chuckles]

224
00:17:15.931 --> 00:17:19.827
Is that my wife?I believe that it is. [chuckles]

225
00:17:19.862 --> 00:17:22.896
Ah! Do we have to
have people come over?

226
00:17:22.931 --> 00:17:24.724
-[Vanessa sighs]
-[doorbell chimes]

227
00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:28.758
All right. Baby. come on.

228
00:17:28.793 --> 00:17:30.689
-Go greet the guests.
-Hmm.

229
00:17:30.724 --> 00:17:32.862
I'm just glad that
I'm wearing tight jeans.

230
00:17:32.896 --> 00:17:35.655
-Hey.
-[Vanessa chuckles]

231
00:17:35.689 --> 00:17:36.758
Get out of here.

232
00:17:41.551 --> 00:17:42.517
[Collin] All right.

233
00:17:44.379 --> 00:17:45.758
[indistinct chatter]

234
00:17:49.689 --> 00:17:51.724
[people laughing]

235
00:17:51.758 --> 00:17:53.482
-How are you doing?
-Collin?

236
00:17:53.517 --> 00:17:55.931
Oh. Carmen. You look great.

237
00:17:55.965 --> 00:17:57.517
Girl. don't you have
that baby tonight.

238
00:17:57.551 --> 00:17:58.758
-Hey. hey. hey.
-Oh. no. no.

239
00:17:58.793 --> 00:17:59.758
-We got another month now.
-Right.

240
00:17:59.793 --> 00:18:02.551
Boys make you look
a little overly pregnant.

241
00:18:02.586 --> 00:18:04.758
Okay. That's what I hear.

242
00:18:04.793 --> 00:18:08.000
-Vanessa! Hello. gorgeous.
-Hi!

243
00:18:08.034 --> 00:18:10.724
-How is my little boy?
-He's kicking away.

244
00:18:10.758 --> 00:18:12.758
I can't wait. Hi. Lance.

245
00:18:12.793 --> 00:18:14.620
So where is everybody?

246
00:18:14.655 --> 00:18:17.793
Uh. The rest of them
couldn't make it. man.

247
00:18:17.827 --> 00:18:19.931
Put the wrong date.
He put the wrong date.

248
00:18:19.965 --> 00:18:21.413
-He put next Sunday.
-Next Sunday.

249
00:18:22.689 --> 00:18:24.620
Yeah. I didn't realize it
until an hour ago.

250
00:18:24.655 --> 00:18:26.482
-but you know...
-Oh. man. That's okay.

251
00:18:26.517 --> 00:18:28.758
I guess that means more
games and fun for us. huh?

252
00:18:28.793 --> 00:18:30.586
-[Lance] Yeah. you're right.
-[Carmen] There you go.

253
00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:32.758
So listen. why don't you guyshead on in. check out the place?

254
00:18:32.793 --> 00:18:35.275

255
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:36.793
-All right?
-All right. Let's have a party.

256
00:18:36.827 --> 00:18:38.758
-[chuckles]
-All right. Frank?

257
00:18:38.793 --> 00:18:41.000
Now we were expecting about
ten more guests tonight

258
00:18:41.034 --> 00:18:45.344
that aren't coming. So if you
want to cook less. be my guest.

259
00:18:45.379 --> 00:18:47.965
And also. can you do me a favor
during the party tonight?

260
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.586
-Check in on my brother?
-Yeah. absolutely.

So they're really not coming.

263
00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:57.551
No. but I do have
someone else that is coming.

264
00:18:57.586 --> 00:18:59.655
-Who?

265
00:19:01.034 --> 00:19:02.896

Uh. Frank. Could you get that?
Look. he's okay.

[chuckles] No. man. You good?

286
00:19:59.724 --> 00:20:01.344
You know. you ain't got to
keep checking on me.

287
00:20:01.379 --> 00:20:03.000
-I ain't going to rob the place.-[Collin chuckles]

288
00:20:03.034 --> 00:20:05.482
-You sure? All right.
-I'm positive.

289
00:20:05.517 --> 00:20:07.034
You know.
I'd get you a job with me. but

290
00:20:07.068 --> 00:20:09.827
they do
criminal background checks.

291
00:20:09.862 --> 00:20:12.827
Tell you the truth. I don't
know how most of these guys
get through.

292
00:20:12.862 --> 00:20:14.103
They're the biggest
crooks of all.

293
00:20:14.137 --> 00:20:16.793
Yeah. It's all good. man.
I'll handle it.

294
00:20:16.827 --> 00:20:19.965
All right. Well. ring this bell.

295
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.655
[bell ringing]

296
00:20:21.689 --> 00:20:23.655
And Frank will bring you
whatever you need.

297
00:20:25.724 --> 00:20:29.517
And. uh... Oh.
help yourself to some wine.

298
00:20:29.551 --> 00:20:31.482
I bought out a vineyard
for. like. four people.

299
00:20:32.586 --> 00:20:34.482
It's all good. man. Water's
fine. man. And thank you.

Look. you know I just got out.
And it's been...

303
00:20:46.517 --> 00:20:48.965
Nothing. Just go
have a good time.

304
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.655
Keep looking
for those apartments.

305
00:20:50.689 --> 00:20:51.620
-All right.

00:20:59.034 --> 00:21:01.689
[people laughing]

308
00:21:01.724 --> 00:21:02.862
[Lance] Oh. come on!

309

-Again?
-[Layla] Oh!

310
00:21:05.862 --> 00:21:07.896
Hey. hey. hey!
Don't feel that bad.

311
00:21:07.931 --> 00:21:10.034
All this means that you guys
are not good liars.

312
00:21:10.068 --> 00:21:13.034
So you're winning with. uh. youknow. life values. right. Lance?

313
00:21:13.068 --> 00:21:14.689
I don't pay my mortgage
with life values. man.

314
00:21:14.724 --> 00:21:16.862
[cheering]

315
00:21:21.896 --> 00:21:23.862
-[inhales]
-Baby. your asthma's
acting up again.

316
00:21:23.896 --> 00:21:26.034
[coughing] I don't know
what it is.

317
00:21:26.068 --> 00:21:28.034
-I'm tearing through
these lately.
-I know.

318
00:21:28.068 --> 00:21:30.137
You're just going to
go back to the doctor. baby.

319
00:21:30.172 --> 00:21:31.931
-Wait. aren't you the doctor?
-I am a dentist.

320
00:21:33.758 --> 00:21:35.034
I was just playing.

321
00:21:35.068 --> 00:21:38.896
-[chuckles] Having fun. baby?
-Yes.

322
00:21:38.931 --> 00:21:41.413
But don't you think
you've had a little bit
too much to drink tonight?

323
00:21:41.448 --> 00:21:43.551
No. And I actually don't think
you've had enough.

324
00:21:43.586 --> 00:21:45.000
-No. thank you. baby.
-Drink it.

325
00:21:46.724 --> 00:21:48.689
Frankie. Uno mas. por favor.

326
00:21:48.724 --> 00:21:51.034
Oh. Frank is down the hall
with my brother.

327
00:21:51.068 --> 00:21:53.517
-Wait. there's
somebody else here?
-Wait a second.

328
00:21:53.551 --> 00:21:55.689
Michael's here? I didn't
even think you guys got along.

329
00:21:55.724 --> 00:21:57.551
And [chuckles] why is--
why is he hiding?

330
00:21:57.586 --> 00:21:59.448
What. is he investigating us
or something?

331
00:21:59.482 --> 00:22:02.655
-Well. my other brother. Trey.
-Tell him to come join us.

332
00:22:02.689 --> 00:22:05.965
-He's working.
-I mean. it'd be good
if he joined us.

333
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.448
because then we can play a game
where the hype man here
doesn't take all of our money.

334
00:22:09.482 --> 00:22:11.758
Wait. wait. wait.
you that-- you never told
me you had two brothers.

335
00:22:11.793 --> 00:22:13.931
You told me about a cop.
What? Is he the robber?

336
00:22:13.965 --> 00:22:16.758
Oh. he may come out later.
Frank! Hey.

337
00:22:16.793 --> 00:22:18.068
You mind? So it's for everyone?

338
00:22:18.103 --> 00:22:20.758
Yeah. you got it.
Shall I pour the Karuizawa?

339
00:22:20.793 --> 00:22:22.931
-Yes.
-That's right. Yes. Absolutely.

340
00:22:22.965 --> 00:22:26.827
Hey. That's the bottle.
[mumbles]

341
00:22:26.862 --> 00:22:28.655
Now this bottle is fantastic.

342
00:22:28.689 --> 00:22:30.206
Yeah. You ever drink that?
All right. all right.

343
00:22:30.241 --> 00:22:32.965
[indistinct chatter]

344
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.586
[Collin] Here it comes. baby.
Yeah. Karuizawa!

345
00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:36.482
Karuizawa. I don't even know
what that means.

346
00:22:38.655 --> 00:22:40.034
-Yeah. you guys are
going to love this.
-We are lucky.

347
00:22:40.068 --> 00:22:42.068
[Frank] A shot for everybody.

348
00:22:42.103 --> 00:22:44.103
-[Collin] Here you go. babe.
-Thank you. baby.

349
00:22:44.137 --> 00:22:46.068
All right.
And then here you go. Lance.

350
00:22:46.103 --> 00:22:48.586
All right. you guys.
Now. new lives.

351
00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:50.896
Newfound success and friends.

352
00:22:50.931 --> 00:22:53.482

[upbeat music]

354
00:23:48.551 --> 00:23:51.206
Harry. listen to me. You've
had way too much to drink.

355
00:23:51.241 --> 00:23:53.655
It's time to go. Layla.
Can you take him home?

356
00:23:53.689 --> 00:23:55.724
[Layla]
Of course.
It wouldn't be the first time.

357
00:23:55.758 --> 00:23:58.103
No. they've been drinking.
I'll call them an Uber.

358
00:23:58.137 --> 00:24:01.034
[Layla]
No. it's okay. We're okay.

359
00:24:01.068 --> 00:24:02.724
[Harry]
You know what? You jealous?

360
00:24:07.724 --> 00:24:09.034
[bell ringing]

361
00:24:12.068 --> 00:24:15.034
-[bell ringing]
-Frank!

362
00:24:15.068 --> 00:24:17.206
Calling you jealous?
You are jealous.

363
00:24:17.241 --> 00:24:19.241
You are jealous of my success.
You're jealous of my money.

364
00:24:19.275 --> 00:24:21.793
-You're jealous of my girl.
-Hey.

365
00:24:21.827 --> 00:24:24.689
Harry. You're embarrassing me.
Let's just leave. baby.

366
00:24:24.724 --> 00:24:26.206
[bell ringing]

367
00:24:30.206 --> 00:24:31.206
[bell ringing]

368
00:24:32.724 --> 00:24:33.896
Frank?

369
00:24:39.965 --> 00:24:42.241
No. no. no. We're not going
anywhere. we're staying
right here.

370
00:24:42.275 --> 00:24:44.034
You know?
Maybe we should all go.

371
00:24:44.068 --> 00:24:47.206
Baby is tired.
We got work in the morning.

372
00:24:47.241 --> 00:24:49.965
-Thank you.
-Hey. is everything
all right in here?

373
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.034
-You're good. bro?
-We were just leaving.

374
00:24:52.068 --> 00:24:54.068
-[Collin] We're good.
-Harry's just had too much
to drink.

375
00:24:54.103 --> 00:24:57.068
No. no. no.
That's "Hype Man Harry" to you!

376
00:24:57.103 --> 00:24:59.758
You lost your whole damn mind?
You don't hold your finger
in my wife's face!

377
00:25:01.275 --> 00:25:03.965
You must be the secret brother.

378
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.241
-I bet you got a lot
of secrets to tell.
-Shut it down. man.

379
00:25:06.275 --> 00:25:08.275
Trey. We're good in here.

380
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:10.275
All right. I'm just going
to get a glass of water.

381
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:12.241
-I'll actually grab it for you.
-No. it's all right. I got it.

382
00:25:12.275 --> 00:25:14.241
Get me one while you're at it.

383
00:25:14.275 --> 00:25:16.241
Hey. man. calm down.
you're drunk.

384
00:25:16.275 --> 00:25:18.827
It's time to go.
You got to go. man!

385
00:25:18.862 --> 00:25:21.655
-[yelling] You have
all of this because of me!
-Stop!

386
00:25:21.689 --> 00:25:23.068
All of this! And you
kick me out of your house!

387
00:25:23.103 --> 00:25:26.241
[shouting and screaming]

388
00:25:26.275 --> 00:25:28.965
Hey. hey. hey! Stop!

389
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.931
-You want to kick me
out of your house?
-Hey. hey. hey. man. relax!

390
00:25:31.965 --> 00:25:34.068
[Harry yelling]

391
00:25:34.103 --> 00:25:35.931
[women scream]

392
00:25:35.965 --> 00:25:37.620
[dramatic musical sting]

393
00:25:48.793 --> 00:25:49.827
[muted speech]

394
00:25:55.689 --> 00:25:58.827
-[distorted sounds]
-[Lance] Frank. get a towel!
Get a towel.

395
00:25:58.862 --> 00:26:00.896
Baby. baby?

396
00:26:00.931 --> 00:26:02.000
[Collin]
All right. I got a towel.

397
00:26:04.103 --> 00:26:06.310
You guys. there's
a lot of blood.

398
00:26:06.344 --> 00:26:07.827
Someone call 911!

399
00:26:07.862 --> 00:26:10.379
[muffled sounds]

400
00:26:11.379 --> 00:26:12.344
-No!
-Hey!

401
00:26:14.931 --> 00:26:18.103
[Collin] Trey? Trey.

402
00:26:18.137 --> 00:26:21.724
-Give me the bag.
We need to call 911.-No. He was about to attack you.

403
00:26:21.758 --> 00:26:24.172
We don't need an explanation.
We need an ambulance!

404
00:26:24.206 --> 00:26:26.172
No. I need you guys
to understand that
this was an accident.

405
00:26:27.931 --> 00:26:30.137
-Give me the bag.
-No.

406
00:26:30.172 --> 00:26:31.482
[screaming]

407
00:26:31.517 --> 00:26:33.206
Shut up! Shut up.

408
00:26:35.068 --> 00:26:37.379
-Shut up!
-Bro. bro! Hey! Listen to me.

409
00:26:39.379 --> 00:26:41.724
Whatever this is. we can
talk about it without the gun.

410
00:26:42.517 --> 00:26:44.931
Look at him.

411
00:26:44.965 --> 00:26:47.172
He needs to go to a hospital.
Now!

412
00:26:47.206 --> 00:26:48.482
I'm not stupid. Collin.
He's already dead.

413
00:26:48.517 --> 00:26:50.000
[stutters]
Please. put the gun down. man.

414
00:26:50.034 --> 00:26:51.379
My wife's pregnant.

415
00:26:51.413 --> 00:26:55.172
Trey? Trey. if you thought
ten years was bad.

416
00:26:55.206 --> 00:26:56.310
if you don't figure
this out. you're going to
go to jail for life.

417
00:26:56.344 --> 00:26:59.034
I'm not going to jail for life!

418
00:26:59.068 --> 00:27:01.448
-We need to call 911.
-I already told you.

419
00:27:01.482 --> 00:27:04.137
We're not calling the police.
I was just protecting
my brother.

420
00:27:04.172 --> 00:27:06.793
-I believe you.
-You believe mecause I got this gun in my hand?

421
00:27:06.827 --> 00:27:10.068
Or you believe me cause
I'm actually telling the truth?

422
00:27:10.103 --> 00:27:13.068
Hey. bro. listen.

423
00:27:13.103 --> 00:27:15.551
Give me the gun. okay?You're not going to hurt anyone.

424
00:27:15.586 --> 00:27:18.379
Shut up! Get up and sit down.

425
00:27:18.413 --> 00:27:19.793
Okay. sit down!

426
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:26.172
-Trey. Trey. it's Trey. right?
-Yeah.

427
00:27:26.206 --> 00:27:29.172
My husband has asthma.
His inhaler is empty.

428
00:27:29.206 --> 00:27:31.275
I have another one
in the car. please.

429
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:33.551
Just let me go
and get his inhaler. please.

430
00:27:33.586 --> 00:27:35.896
No. you're staying right here.

431
00:27:35.931 --> 00:27:40.275
Listen to me. okay?
We saw what happened. but--

432
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:42.448
You don't need to
be doing all this.

433
00:27:42.482 --> 00:27:45.000
How do you think
this is gonna go? Huh?

434
00:27:45.034 --> 00:27:47.482
There's someone dead.
The police show up.

435
00:27:47.517 --> 00:27:50.103
and they just
believe everything we say?

436
00:27:50.137 --> 00:27:53.034
-That's not how it goes.
-Please. man. I can't breathe.

437
00:27:53.068 --> 00:27:55.103
What are you gonna do?
Hold us hostage here forever?

438
00:27:55.137 --> 00:27:58.103
Hostage? Hostages?
Now you guys are hostages?

439
00:27:58.137 --> 00:28:01.344
-Please. I-- He has asthma.
-Sit down! Sit down!

440
00:28:01.379 --> 00:28:03.448
-[Carmen] Please.
just let me go.
-[Trey] No. shut up!

441
00:28:03.482 --> 00:28:06.000
Shut up and sit down!
Please!

442
00:28:06.034 --> 00:28:07.103
[groans]

443
00:28:07.137 --> 00:28:08.482
Alright. I'm sorry.

444
00:28:09.551 --> 00:28:12.137
I am a good person.

445
00:28:12.172 --> 00:28:14.310
But sometimes life isn't
good to good people.

446
00:28:14.344 --> 00:28:17.275
Sometimes life puts people
in bad situations.

447
00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:19.172
And they don't
put life on trial.

448
00:28:19.206 --> 00:28:20.172
They put people on trial.

449
00:28:21.517 --> 00:28:24.448
So we just need to
figure this out.

450
00:28:24.482 --> 00:28:27.310
Where's the bag at? Where--

451
00:28:29.413 --> 00:28:32.482
They've been listening the wholetime? Why would you call 911?

452
00:28:39.206 --> 00:28:40.517
Why would you do that?

453
00:28:42.344 --> 00:28:45.172
Look. I should have
never showed up here.

454
00:28:45.206 --> 00:28:48.551
-I shouldn't even come here--
-Trey. why don't you
drop the gun?

455
00:28:48.586 --> 00:28:53.310
I've been told many times
that people like us don't last
long out here. That's why.

456
00:28:53.344 --> 00:28:56.310
[sirens wailing and
tires screeching]

457
00:28:58.482 --> 00:29:02.034
[police sirens wailing]

458
00:29:07.103 --> 00:29:10.379
[commotion]

459
00:29:10.413 --> 00:29:11.379
What is it?
What's all the noise?

460
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:16.034
[police sirens wailing]

461
00:29:18.103 --> 00:29:21.620
[tense music]

462
00:29:21.655 --> 00:29:24.034
What are you doing. man?
Sit down. Sit down!

463
00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:30.896
Is he trying to
get me locked up again?
Man. I should shoot you.

464
00:29:32.068 --> 00:29:32.896
[Collin] Hey. man. Hey.

465
00:29:34.068 --> 00:29:36.068
Take it easy.

466
00:29:36.103 --> 00:29:38.448
[Trey]Look. there's a change of plans.

467
00:29:38.482 --> 00:29:41.517
Alright.
I know everyone's scared.

468
00:29:41.551 --> 00:29:44.379
But I don't want
anyone else to get hurt.

469
00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.206
So I need everyone
to work with me.

470
00:29:53.586 --> 00:29:56.068
-And not against me.
-[Carmen cries]

471
00:29:57.310 --> 00:30:01.275
Okay. I need Vanessa.
Vanessa. get up and close
the blinds and the drapes now.

472
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:05.344
-Go. baby. go. go. go.
-Collin. I need you to
get pillows. blankets.

473
00:30:05.379 --> 00:30:06.689
so everyone's comfortable.

474
00:30:06.724 --> 00:30:08.034
-Frank?
-Yes.

475
00:30:08.068 --> 00:30:09.034
-Help him.
-Come with me.

476
00:30:16.482 --> 00:30:18.172
Yeah. I'm gonna
stay right here.

477
00:30:18.206 --> 00:30:20.034
Until I figure this out.

478
00:30:21.275 --> 00:30:22.379
[sighs] Damn.
What am I going to do?

479
00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:24.586
Not the police.

480
00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:27.551
Oh.

481
00:30:31.551 --> 00:30:33.517
[police sirens wailing]

482
00:30:33.551 --> 00:30:35.689
[Mike]
You're crossing a line here.

483
00:30:35.724 --> 00:30:38.551
This is my territory.
look. this is my brother.

484
00:30:38.586 --> 00:30:40.413
This is family business.
it's way above you.

485
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.379
-Get the teams in position
and secure the perimeter. Now!
-Yes. sir.

486
00:30:52.068 --> 00:30:55.448
-[Lance gasping for air]
-[Carmen mumbles]

487
00:30:55.482 --> 00:30:58.517
Oh. my God! Please. please.
we got to get him an inhaler.
He can go into shock.

488
00:30:58.551 --> 00:31:00.655
Baby. come here. breathe.
Sit up. darling.

489
00:31:00.689 --> 00:31:02.275
-Give him some water.
-Okay.

490
00:31:03.206 --> 00:31:05.448
Oh. man. they're gearing up.
They're about to come in.

491
00:31:12.655 --> 00:31:16.103
Trey. calm down.
Trey. Calm down.

492
00:31:17.034 --> 00:31:19.000
We'll vouch for you.
It was an accident.

493
00:31:19.034 --> 00:31:21.275
We all know that you
didn't mean to kill Harry.

494
00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:23.241
Nigga you serious? What.
you going to vouch for me

495
00:31:23.275 --> 00:31:24.758
like Michael did with Mom?

496
00:31:24.793 --> 00:31:27.448
Huh? I tell you
I ain't do it.

497
00:31:27.482 --> 00:31:28.310
But you don't listen.

498
00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:34.000
Give me that camera
from the driveway.

499
00:31:34.034 --> 00:31:35.620
and if you got one
on the right-- right here.

500
00:31:35.655 --> 00:31:38.275
If your mother's death
was an accident.

501
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:40.034
then why did you go
to prison for murder?

502
00:31:40.068 --> 00:31:41.448
Because that's what happens
when you come from

503
00:31:41.482 --> 00:31:43.137
where we come from.
Ain't that right. Collin?

504
00:31:45.482 --> 00:31:48.034
Being from the hood
ain't nothing to brag about.

505
00:31:48.068 --> 00:31:50.241
Matter of fact. the farther awayyou get from the hood.
the better off you are.

506
00:31:50.275 --> 00:31:52.172
And that's a fact.

507
00:31:52.206 --> 00:31:54.448
If I was from a rich
or more decent part of town.

508
00:31:54.482 --> 00:31:56.172
they would have used
those taxpayer dollars

509
00:31:56.206 --> 00:31:58.000
to investigate
and find out the details.

510
00:31:58.793 --> 00:32:01.379
But they don't use those
dollars on people like me.

511
00:32:01.413 --> 00:32:03.137
They just need someone to blame
it on so they can move on.

512
00:32:03.172 --> 00:32:04.482
So what happened?

513
00:32:04.517 --> 00:32:07.310
I was 16. and. and Michael--

514
00:32:07.344 --> 00:32:09.344
[phone buzzing]

515
00:32:16.517 --> 00:32:17.344
Hello?

516
00:32:18.689 --> 00:32:20.517
Yes. he is. Hold on.
It's for you.

517
00:32:24.551 --> 00:32:26.344
-How long. Collin?
-Michael?

518
00:32:26.379 --> 00:32:27.655
Collin.

519
00:32:27.689 --> 00:32:29.172
-Yeah.
-Listen.

520
00:32:30.206 --> 00:32:31.517
How many people do you have
in there with you?

521
00:32:31.551 --> 00:32:33.689
Eight. Including myself.

522
00:32:33.724 --> 00:32:35.517
-What are you doing?
-I'm coming in there.

523
00:32:36.448 --> 00:32:39.724
Yeah. I just need you to
hang in there for me. Okay?

524
00:32:39.758 --> 00:32:42.344
We're fine. So they
sent you to handle this?

525
00:32:42.379 --> 00:32:46.344
Let me help you. bro.

526
00:32:46.379 --> 00:32:49.206
It's Trey. But. look.it's not what it looks like.

527
00:32:49.241 --> 00:32:53.413
So it's not a hostage situation.and I can have the police
just storm right in there?

528
00:32:53.448 --> 00:32:55.724
Yeah. I didn't think so.
Look. just hang tight and I'm
going to get back at you.

529
00:32:59.379 --> 00:33:01.896
Listen. I need eyes
on the inside.

530
00:33:01.931 --> 00:33:04.586
It's Michael. He's coming in.

531
00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:06.413
They think they're just
going to send them in here

532
00:33:06.448 --> 00:33:07.655
going to sweet-talk me
to my own death?

533
00:33:07.689 --> 00:33:09.275
You think
they're going to kill you?

534
00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:10.241
What does it matter?

535
00:33:11.793 --> 00:33:13.793
I'm never
going to get no justice.

536
00:33:13.827 --> 00:33:15.620
-[Carmen] Please. please.
-[Vanessa] Collin.

537
00:33:15.655 --> 00:33:18.793
-[Carmen] Can we get some help?
-Relax. he's good.

538
00:33:18.827 --> 00:33:21.758
There was this guy in prison
had horrible asthma.

539
00:33:21.793 --> 00:33:25.620
Police used to ration
his inhaler. He used to
sit and meditate

540
00:33:25.655 --> 00:33:29.241
and drink hot coffee. He said
it opened up his airways
for a couple of hours.

541
00:33:29.275 --> 00:33:33.103
-Frank.
-Trey. man. listen.
I will do whatever.

542
00:33:33.137 --> 00:33:35.586
I'm not holding you here againstyour will because I have
anything against you.

543
00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.793
-Come on. man. Please.
-All you guys are actually
the only thing

544
00:33:37.827 --> 00:33:39.448
I have to live for.

545
00:33:39.482 --> 00:33:40.758
Without you I'm dead.

546
00:33:42.793 --> 00:33:45.551
Frank. I need you to
make some coffee now.

547
00:33:45.586 --> 00:33:46.620
[tires screeching]

548
00:33:56.620 --> 00:34:00.896
Mike!
How are things going here?

549
00:34:00.931 --> 00:34:03.827
Obviously a hostage situation.
but we got everything
under control.

550
00:34:03.862 --> 00:34:06.724
That's good. because
I want to make sure that
this goes away really quickly.

551
00:34:06.758 --> 00:34:08.482
You know. before the news
gets ahold of it.

552
00:34:08.517 --> 00:34:11.172
You got the entire city
on the line.

553
00:34:11.206 --> 00:34:12.896
And quite frankly. I don't
give a damn who's in there.

554
00:34:12.931 --> 00:34:15.793
I don't really think
we need you or your team
here right now.

555
00:34:15.827 --> 00:34:19.344
So why don't you
just let me do my job?

556
00:34:19.379 --> 00:34:23.310
Hm. You're up for
a promotion. aren't you?

557
00:34:23.344 --> 00:34:26.965
I thought so. Now listen.
you handle this situation...

558
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.689
and I can push that
through for you. Huge pay.

559
00:34:31.862 --> 00:34:35.482
Beautiful little home
on a lake that you
and your wife always wanted.

560
00:34:35.517 --> 00:34:36.655
Do not screw this up.

561
00:34:37.827 --> 00:34:39.137
Do you understand what I mean?

562
00:34:39.827 --> 00:34:42.137
-You can count on me.
-Good.

563
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.482
Oh. and by the way.

564
00:34:45.517 --> 00:34:47.655
I don't want
any valuable tax dollars...

565
00:34:48.689 --> 00:34:50.724
wasted on saving
that murderer man.

566
00:34:51.827 --> 00:34:53.482
Brother or not.

567
00:34:54.655 --> 00:34:55.379
Do you know what I mean?

568
00:34:56.655 --> 00:34:58.310
I understand. sir.

569
00:34:59.379 --> 00:35:02.620
Good. I'll be in the tent.
and I'll be watching.

570
00:35:03.724 --> 00:35:04.448
This way. sir.

571
00:35:22.586 --> 00:35:23.586
We should cover the body.

572
00:35:25.379 --> 00:35:25.862
Let's do it.

573
00:35:29.758 --> 00:35:31.517
I'm going to go grab a blanket.

574
00:35:32.551 --> 00:35:34.344
[Collin] All right. Let's flip
him over on the count of three.

575
00:35:35.448 --> 00:35:37.241
One. two. three.

576
00:35:39.517 --> 00:35:42.344
Okay. One. two. three!

577
00:36:03.413 --> 00:36:05.793
[tense music]

578
00:36:11.586 --> 00:36:12.413
Oh. man.

579
00:36:16.586 --> 00:36:17.413
[Vanessa] Trey?

580
00:36:32.758 --> 00:36:33.655
Come on. man. Let's get you a...

581
00:36:35.448 --> 00:36:36.413
Watch out. I got it.

582
00:36:40.827 --> 00:36:43.931
Look. drink that coffee.
it'll help.

583
00:36:43.965 --> 00:36:45.965
Just a little more time.
I'm trying to figure
something out.

584
00:36:47.482 --> 00:36:48.551
-Here.
-[Carmen grunts]

585
00:36:48.586 --> 00:36:50.931
Okay. okay. You all right?

586
00:36:50.965 --> 00:36:53.448
Yeah. The coffee is
not good for the baby.

587
00:36:53.482 --> 00:36:55.586
-I think he's
kicking a little too hard.
-[Frank] Sit back.

588
00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:58.482
[Carmen breathing deeply]

589
00:36:58.517 --> 00:37:01.000
[Mike on bullhorn]
Collin! Trey!

590
00:37:01.034 --> 00:37:04.344
Look. I don't wanna have to
talk to you guys over this
and announce to everyone

591
00:37:04.379 --> 00:37:06.103
what I would like to just
keep between you and I.

592
00:37:06.137 --> 00:37:09.482
So. please. you need
to pick up the phone.

593
00:37:11.689 --> 00:37:13.482
Somebody pick up the phone.

594
00:37:15.827 --> 00:37:17.724
Please pick up the phone.

595
00:37:20.586 --> 00:37:23.655
-Michael?
-[indistinct]

596
00:37:23.689 --> 00:37:26.896
Hello. hello?
Trey.

597
00:37:26.931 --> 00:37:30.000
I heard the 911 call.
Someone is hurt in there.

598
00:37:32.689 --> 00:37:34.827
I guess this is the only way
I can get to talk to you. huh?

599
00:37:34.862 --> 00:37:39.000
This is definitely not
a good way. Trey. but
I'm glad to hear your voice.

600
00:37:39.034 --> 00:37:42.000
Can't be that good.
or you would've come up there
to visit me and hear it.

601
00:37:42.034 --> 00:37:46.413
Listen. the city doesn't want meto end this I a peaceful way.
so we can catch up later.

602
00:37:46.448 --> 00:37:49.827
But what I need is for you to
let us know that this is all
just a big misunderstanding.

603
00:37:49.862 --> 00:37:52.689
Why are you
talking to me like this?

604
00:37:52.724 --> 00:37:55.862
Like you don't know me.
If anyone knows me. you do.

605
00:37:55.896 --> 00:38:01.448
Trey. I know you don't want
to hurt anybody. And I know
you are a good person.

606
00:38:01.482 --> 00:38:04.724
You just must have been
too busy with your life and
getting things you dreamed of

607
00:38:04.758 --> 00:38:07.724
-instead of
coming to visit me. huh?-Hey. man we can catch up later.

608
00:38:07.758 --> 00:38:10.034
but let me tell you something.
Right now. believe it or not.

609
00:38:10.068 --> 00:38:12.758
I'm the only one out here
who's on your side.

610
00:38:12.793 --> 00:38:15.862
Why? When are we gonna talk
about it? In another 20 years

611
00:38:15.896 --> 00:38:17.034
when I get out of prison again?

612
00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:19.862
What do you want. man?

613
00:38:19.896 --> 00:38:21.034
What do I want?

614
00:38:21.862 --> 00:38:24.586
I want my life back.
That's what I want.

615
00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:27.379
We need you to let us get that body out of the house.

616
00:38:30.206 --> 00:38:31.551
[man] Mike.

617
00:38:32.965 --> 00:38:35.896
Perimeter's secure. Putting
two snipers on the roof
as we speak.

618
00:38:35.931 --> 00:38:38.103
-Blueprints of the house.
-Yeah. This is
my brother's place.

619
00:38:38.137 --> 00:38:40.068
I already know the layout.
so I don't need that.

620
00:38:40.103 --> 00:38:41.931
-I appreciate it.
-All right. whatever you need
let me know.

621
00:38:41.965 --> 00:38:43.551
-All right. Thank you.
-[phone ringing]

622
00:38:43.586 --> 00:38:44.896
Sir. Sir. we've got a call.

623
00:38:46.586 --> 00:38:48.413
-Collin.
-Michael.

624
00:38:48.448 --> 00:38:49.724
Okay. Do me a favor.
put Vanessa on the phone.

625
00:38:54.931 --> 00:38:56.758
Okay. All right.
All right. Here she is.

626
00:38:56.793 --> 00:38:58.551
-[Carmen moaning]
-Okay. Come on. baby.

627
00:38:59.586 --> 00:39:00.482
Michael?

628
00:39:01.517 --> 00:39:02.965
Hi. Vanessa.

629
00:39:04.551 --> 00:39:08.103
Yeah. look. I know it's a lot
going on. but I want you
to calm down. relax.

630
00:39:08.137 --> 00:39:09.103
We're going to
get you out of there.

631
00:39:21.896 --> 00:39:24.689
I need you to unlock the back
door. Can you do that for me?

632
00:39:24.724 --> 00:39:25.482
Okay.

633
00:39:26.241 --> 00:39:27.172
Okay.

634
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.103
-Yeah?
-Collin.

635
00:39:31.137 --> 00:39:32.689
Put Trey back on the phone.

636
00:39:32.724 --> 00:39:33.827
He's right here.

637
00:39:35.172 --> 00:39:37.517
-No. I don't want to talk.
-Trey. take the phone

638
00:39:37.551 --> 00:39:39.724
-Told you I don't wanna talk.
-He won't take it.

639
00:39:41.758 --> 00:39:45.034
Okay. Everybody listen up.

640
00:39:45.068 --> 00:39:50.034
[Mike] Listen. I got some
very rich people who donated
a lot of money to this city.

641
00:39:50.068 --> 00:39:52.965
Now. that's not a good thing.
bro. Not for you. not for me.

642
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000
They are very well known people.

643
00:39:56.034 --> 00:39:58.172
And my hope is
to keep this quiet.

644
00:39:58.206 --> 00:40:01.517
Yeah. you haven't told me yet
how you want this to end.

645
00:40:01.551 --> 00:40:04.827
That's why I need you to let
me know. uh. what you need.

646
00:40:04.862 --> 00:40:08.137
What you need to make you feel
safe. You still got hostages.

647
00:40:08.172 --> 00:40:10.793
and I don't want this to get
any worse. so Trey.

648
00:40:10.827 --> 00:40:12.862
how can I help you?

649
00:40:12.896 --> 00:40:13.793
I'll call you back.

650
00:40:13.827 --> 00:40:14.827
[all] Oh!

651
00:40:18.655 --> 00:40:19.896
He hung up.

652
00:40:27.724 --> 00:40:32.034
Trey! Trey! If you're trying to
change. why are carrying a gun?

653
00:40:32.068 --> 00:40:33.655
Because of what people told you?

654
00:40:33.689 --> 00:40:35.551
No. 'cause what
two people told me.

655
00:40:35.586 --> 00:40:36.862
Why do you care
what people have to say to you?

656
00:40:36.896 --> 00:40:38.655
'Cause one was my brother.

657
00:40:38.689 --> 00:40:40.827
Trey. just let me go!

658
00:40:40.862 --> 00:40:43.724
I'll tell the cops it was an
accident. He slipped. he fell!

659
00:40:43.758 --> 00:40:46.000
Please. I just met him
two days ago.

660
00:40:46.034 --> 00:40:48.000
He doesn't mean anything to me!
Please!

661
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.137
[distorted voices]

662
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.172
-[Carmen] Yeah.

663
00:41:01.206 --> 00:41:02.965
[Carmen groans]

664
00:41:07.379 --> 00:41:12.931
[muffled speech]
...it might be contractions.

665
00:41:12.965 --> 00:41:15.034
-[Carmen grunts]
-You have to breathe. OK?

666
00:41:16.241 --> 00:41:18.724
Hey. hey. hey. Listen.
What's his name?

667
00:41:18.758 --> 00:41:20.862
Orbis. It means world in Latin.

668
00:41:20.896 --> 00:41:23.620
[muffled sounds]

669
00:41:31.379 --> 00:41:34.724
[tense music]

670
00:41:38.206 --> 00:41:39.758
Have a clear shot now.

671
00:41:39.793 --> 00:41:41.034
If you can't see
who's behind him.

672
00:41:41.068 --> 00:41:42.620
do not take the shot!

673
00:41:44.068 --> 00:41:44.896
Shit.

674
00:41:50.068 --> 00:41:52.172
[lieutenant] Mike! Mike!

675
00:41:52.206 --> 00:41:54.172
What the hell are you doing?

676
00:41:54.206 --> 00:41:56.896
This process is
taking way too long!

677
00:41:56.931 --> 00:41:58.931
Now if you had the shot.
why the hell didn't you
take it?

678
00:41:58.965 --> 00:42:01.793
We had everything under control.

679
00:42:01.827 --> 00:42:05.034
I don't want some trigger-happy
sniper killing my brother.

680
00:42:05.068 --> 00:42:07.172
And you asked me to
handle the situation.and that's what I'm doing.

681
00:42:07.206 --> 00:42:09.137
So with all due respect. sir.

Do you understand me?

684
00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:16.103
You're interrupting
my dinner time. boy.

685
00:42:22.103 --> 00:42:23.965
[exhales]

686
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.034
-[Carmen screams]
-Trey. man. please.

687
00:42:26.068 --> 00:42:27.034
we have to get her out of here.

688
00:42:27.068 --> 00:42:28.206
She might be going into labor.

689
00:42:28.241 --> 00:42:29.758
-She's in pain.
-Michael.

690
00:42:29.793 --> 00:42:31.206
Put Trey on the phone now.

691
00:42:31.241 --> 00:42:35.034
-[Carmen screams]
-Trey.
-[chattering]

692
00:42:35.068 --> 00:42:37.275
You got to give us
something. Trey.

693
00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:39.206
I mean. I'm under a lot
of pressure to end this
a different way.

694
00:42:39.241 --> 00:42:40.275
and I don't want to shoot you.

695
00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:41.896
Why would I hurt you?

696
00:42:41.931 --> 00:42:43.931
You're my brother.

697
00:42:43.965 --> 00:42:46.620
I just want you. Collin.
and everyone out safely.

698
00:42:47.965 --> 00:42:49.241
You got to give us somebody.

699
00:42:49.275 --> 00:42:51.137
Why. so you can
come up here and kill me?

700
00:42:51.172 --> 00:42:52.931
You'll still have
people in there!

701
00:42:52.965 --> 00:42:55.103
I don't even know what you need.We can't even trade here.

702
00:42:55.137 --> 00:43:00.172
-[Carmen screams]
-[people shout]

703
00:43:00.206 --> 00:43:03.000
-Go get a towel. go.
-Okay.

704
00:43:03.034 --> 00:43:05.034
-How far apart the contractions?-About two minutes apart.

705
00:43:05.068 --> 00:43:06.310
[Vanessa] Okay. she's going
into labor right now.

706
00:43:07.896 --> 00:43:09.000
[Mike] Hold on!

707
00:43:13.482 --> 00:43:15.034
All right. All right.

708
00:43:15.068 --> 00:43:16.103
Tell your men to stand down.

709
00:43:16.137 --> 00:43:18.137
Hey. Hey. look. man.

710
00:43:18.172 --> 00:43:19.896

for a minute.

711
00:43:19.931 --> 00:43:22.206
Look. I've been
a psychiatrist for ten years.

712
00:43:22.241 --> 00:43:24.310
I've talked to
a lot of crazy people.

713
00:43:24.344 --> 00:43:26.172
I know the difference
between crazy

714
00:43:26.206 --> 00:43:29.000
and people whose life
just went in the wrong way.

715
00:43:29.034 --> 00:43:30.344
Okay? I know you're a good man.

716
00:43:31.862 --> 00:43:34.000
I'll do my best to help you.

717
00:43:34.034 --> 00:43:37.862
But please. please.

718
00:43:37.896 --> 00:43:39.034
and have our baby
in a healthy manner.

719
00:43:41.344 --> 00:43:42.310
-Okay.
-Thank you.

720
00:43:44.896 --> 00:43:46.655
We got to get her to a hospital.Let's go.

[Carmen grunting]

723
00:43:51.310 --> 00:43:53.310
Then why you ain't come visit me

724
00:43:53.344 --> 00:43:54.655
or come to see me after
everything I did for you?

725
00:43:56.137 --> 00:43:58.689

[sniper] Why?

732
00:44:15.931 --> 00:44:17.379
It's now or maybe never
we'll get the chance.

733
00:44:20.206 --> 00:44:21.068
Not yet.

734
00:44:22.379 --> 00:44:26.068

-Thank you so much. Thank you.

742

[gunshot]

745
00:45:12.448 --> 00:45:14.103
Who took the shot?

746
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.448
I told you not

Come on. bro.

752
00:45:30.862 --> 00:45:32.103
Vanessa?

753
00:45:32.137 --> 00:45:33.344
Stay low. Get over here. Layla!

754
00:45:36.034 --> 00:45:37.034
You're hit?

755
00:45:37.068 --> 00:45:39.034
[Trey] Ah. man. [grunts]

756
00:45:39.068 --> 00:45:39.793
I've never been shot before.

757
00:45:42.862 --> 00:45:45.448
-Listen. man. You were right.
-[Trey breathing deeply]

758
00:45:45.482 --> 00:45:49.448
Okay? I wasn't there.
For ten years. man. That's--

759
00:45:49.482 --> 00:45:51.275
That's all I've thought about.
What could I have done.
what could I have said.

760
00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:55.827
I'm sorry. man.
I'm sorry.

761
00:46:00.931 --> 00:46:04.241
But after everything that
happened. man. me and Mike were
just devastated.

762
00:46:04.275 --> 00:46:08.344
Lost Dad. did Mom. We promised
to never talk about it again.

763
00:46:08.379 --> 00:46:11.344
You used to have Collin.
Told you to watch your back?

764
00:46:11.379 --> 00:46:13.241
I'm trying to tell you.
Michael set me up.

765
00:46:14.379 --> 00:46:16.172
And now he's trying to kill me.

766
00:46:17.275 --> 00:46:20.413
Although he never talked
about it. every time
I mentioned you

767
00:46:20.448 --> 00:46:22.241
or asked him to
write to you in jail.

768
00:46:22.275 --> 00:46:26.896
went to this angry. dark place.
it's what split us apart.

769
00:46:26.931 --> 00:46:31.172
Trey. it took me a long time
to forgive what happened. man.

770
00:46:31.206 --> 00:46:33.034
But you served the time
for what you did.

771
00:46:33.068 --> 00:46:35.517
You're wrong. man.
I did my time. a lot of it.

772
00:46:35.551 --> 00:46:37.344
I don't have
the life you guys have.

773
00:46:37.379 --> 00:46:39.896
It was Michael
who gone and kill Mom.

774
00:46:39.931 --> 00:46:43.344
That camera near the side.
I need more of that.

775
00:46:43.379 --> 00:46:46.896
There's a lot you don't know.
There's a lot.

776
00:46:46.931 --> 00:46:49.586
Michael was involved in drugs.
and he was giving them to Mom.

777
00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:51.068
And she got strung up
because of him.

778
00:46:57.206 --> 00:46:59.862
And I walked in on him giving
Mom a hit of something new.

779
00:47:01.137 --> 00:47:04.103
Arrgh. and I got upset
and started fighting.

780
00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:07.724
And that's when his gun
came out. it hit the ground.

781
00:47:07.758 --> 00:47:11.068
That's when Mom got hit.
And we both panicked.

782
00:47:12.689 --> 00:47:16.448
And he cleaned the gun off
and told me to hide it.
That's when the police came.

783
00:47:16.482 --> 00:47:19.275
and they went straight to
where Michael told me to put
the gun with my prints on it.

784
00:47:19.310 --> 00:47:21.586
I'm trying to tell you.
He set me up.

785
00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:24.241
Why the hell did you
never say anything. man?

786
00:47:24.275 --> 00:47:26.413
Man. cause that's what
you guys have stood in my head.

787
00:47:26.448 --> 00:47:29.379
You don't ever rat. Especiallyon your family. You don't do it.

788
00:47:29.413 --> 00:47:30.413
Oh. my God. Trey.

789
00:47:32.689 --> 00:47:35.034
-They just pinned it on you.
-I've been trying
to tell you guys.

790
00:47:35.068 --> 00:47:37.103
they don't use taxpayer
dollars on people like me!

791
00:47:37.827 --> 00:47:40.413
Trey. She doesn't have
anything to do with this.

792
00:47:40.448 --> 00:47:43.068
It's family business.
Give me your phone.

793
00:47:49.655 --> 00:47:51.586
Michael. I'm coming out!

794
00:47:54.655 --> 00:47:56.965
Layla. get over here. Move!

795
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Oh. my God. Thank you.
I hope everything works out.

796
00:48:03.655 --> 00:48:04.482
Hold on!

797
00:48:06.689 --> 00:48:08.689
Vanessa. I need you to get
something to stop the blood.

798
00:48:11.206 --> 00:48:12.310
Thank you. Thank you.

799
00:48:15.344 --> 00:48:16.206
Stay down.

800
00:48:17.172 --> 00:48:18.137
[grunts]

801
00:48:22.137 --> 00:48:22.689
I'm going out!

802
00:48:26.482 --> 00:48:28.482
[Mike] Hey!
Everybody stand down.

803
00:48:39.482 --> 00:48:41.482
We need to talk. Alone.

804
00:48:47.655 --> 00:48:50.517
[tense music]

805
00:49:01.655 --> 00:49:03.034
Collin. you couldn't get
Vanessa out?

806
00:49:03.862 --> 00:49:05.448
[whack]

807
00:49:05.482 --> 00:49:06.344
What the hell is wrong with you?

808
00:49:06.379 --> 00:49:07.379
You said nothing!

809
00:49:08.379 --> 00:49:10.034
-[whacks]
-[Mike grunts]

810
00:49:10.793 --> 00:49:13.379
-Are you crazy?
-Collin. you better cool it.

811
00:49:13.413 --> 00:49:14.517
Don't make me have to
pull this trigger.

812
00:49:14.551 --> 00:49:16.689
Hayes. back off.

813
00:49:16.724 --> 00:49:18.379
It's all good.
It's just family business.

814
00:49:19.551 --> 00:49:21.586
You killed Mom!

815
00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:24.068
You let Trey rot in prison.
and you said nothing!

816
00:49:24.103 --> 00:49:25.344
-Listen to me.
-And then you try
to have him shot!

817
00:49:25.379 --> 00:49:26.724
I did not order that!

818
00:49:30.137 --> 00:49:33.206
You do that one more time.
I'm going to put a bullet
in your head. You hear me?

819
00:49:33.241 --> 00:49:35.620
Collin. I'm
warning you one more time.

820
00:49:35.655 --> 00:49:38.103
Hayes. back off. or I'm have
your ass written up. Back off!

821
00:49:41.413 --> 00:49:43.551
I don't know how you lived
with yourself all these years.

822
00:49:43.586 --> 00:49:45.344
You don't know.
you weren't there.

823
00:49:45.379 --> 00:49:47.724
You gave Mom drugs?

824
00:49:47.758 --> 00:49:49.517
You gave her drugs. man.
What were you thinking?

825
00:49:51.862 --> 00:49:53.517
I was a kid myself. Collin.

826
00:49:54.724 --> 00:49:55.689
You weren't there.

827
00:49:58.413 --> 00:50:01.448
You set our brother up.

828
00:50:01.482 --> 00:50:03.689
You knew he would listen
to you. He was only 16.
He was your brother!

829
00:50:05.551 --> 00:50:07.172
-Oh. so you think it's my fault?-Yeah.

830
00:50:07.206 --> 00:50:09.034
Yeah. it was my gun.

831
00:50:09.068 --> 00:50:10.551
But Trey knows he's the reason
why Mom is dead.

832
00:50:12.758 --> 00:50:14.344
He should have never
got involved in my business.

833
00:50:14.379 --> 00:50:15.724
or Mom would still be alive!

834
00:50:18.068 --> 00:50:20.551
You let our little brother
take the fall for your mistake.

835
00:50:22.551 --> 00:50:24.551
Because you're
too much of a coward!

836
00:50:24.586 --> 00:50:26.344
I am warning you
for the last time.

837
00:50:26.379 --> 00:50:28.655
Yeah. well. you better
hurry up and do it now.

838
00:50:28.689 --> 00:50:31.620
because here's my only warning.

839
00:50:31.655 --> 00:50:35.000
You better find a way
to get Trey out of all
of this. and I mean. all of it.

840
00:50:35.758 --> 00:50:37.689
Or I'm going to tell
everyone what happened.

841
00:50:40.068 --> 00:50:41.551
Oh. do you think they would
give a damn about it?

842
00:50:43.034 --> 00:50:46.172
You think they're going to
overturn their ruling
for some ghetto kids?

843
00:50:46.206 --> 00:50:47.379
-[Mike laughs]
-Let's see.

844
00:50:49.551 --> 00:50:51.172
Trey got what
he deserved. brother.

845
00:50:52.103 --> 00:50:53.689
So you shouldn't
think he's so innocent.

846
00:50:54.517 --> 00:50:56.000
He should have
never got involved.

847
00:50:57.689 --> 00:50:59.310
Fix it.

848
00:50:59.344 --> 00:51:00.413
I have a wife.

849
00:51:01.586 --> 00:51:03.068
I have kids.

850
00:51:04.655 --> 00:51:07.793
Why would you want us to
go down for some gang BS
that happened 11 years ago?

851
00:51:09.275 --> 00:51:10.448
Trey's life is over!

852
00:51:12.344 --> 00:51:13.413
And there is nothing
I can do about it.

853
00:51:15.413 --> 00:51:16.413
Fix it.

854
00:51:18.241 --> 00:51:20.586
[tense music]

855
00:52:01.517 --> 00:52:03.172
Mike. What happened. man?

856
00:52:04.379 --> 00:52:07.517
-Family feud.
-Family feud. huh?

857
00:52:07.551 --> 00:52:08.862
Why did your brother.
go back in the house?

858
00:52:08.896 --> 00:52:10.689
It's his house.
I can't tell him he can't.

859
00:52:11.724 --> 00:52:12.862
Do you think he can go
get everybody out of there?

860
00:52:14.586 --> 00:52:15.586
We'll get it done. man.

861
00:52:18.586 --> 00:52:19.689
[lieutenant] Mike!

862
00:52:20.931 --> 00:52:22.137
-What the hell is going on?
-Nothing. We're just talking.

863
00:52:22.172 --> 00:52:25.724
Okay. listen. Don't sound to me
like you're just talking.

864
00:52:25.758 --> 00:52:29.724
Look. I don't give a damn
about your personal family feud
between the two of you.

865
00:52:29.758 --> 00:52:31.862
Your time is up.

866
00:52:31.896 --> 00:52:34.379
We got most
of the hostages out. sir.

867
00:52:34.413 --> 00:52:37.206
-I told you I had it under--
-[yelling] And I told you

868
00:52:37.241 --> 00:52:39.517
that I didn't want this thing
to escalate. didn't I?

869
00:52:39.551 --> 00:52:43.586
Now as far as those hostages
are concerned. you know what
they're doing?

870
00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:44.689
They're threatening me.

871
00:52:44.724 --> 00:52:46.689
They are threatening me to pull

872
00:52:46.724 --> 00:52:48.517
millions of dollars of funding

873
00:52:48.551 --> 00:52:50.689
if I don't back away
from this thing.

874
00:52:50.724 --> 00:52:53.000
Millions of dollars
of funding that comes to us.

875
00:52:53.034 --> 00:52:55.206
Now. I'm going to tell you
how this is going to go.

876
00:52:55.241 --> 00:52:57.482
He's got 30 minutes to walk out
with his hands in the air.

877
00:52:57.517 --> 00:52:58.896
or I'm going to end it!

878
00:52:58.931 --> 00:52:59.758
Wait!

879
00:53:01.448 --> 00:53:02.551
I'll get it done.

880
00:53:02.586 --> 00:53:04.241
You got 30 minutes.

881
00:53:04.931 --> 00:53:06.586
30 minutes.

882
00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:09.448
Get me the hell out of here.

883
00:53:28.758 --> 00:53:31.965
[phone buzzing]

884
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:37.827
Oh. you want me dead. huh?
That's why I had to do a ten
year stint for your accident?

885
00:53:37.862 --> 00:53:40.448
I know we didn't deserve
what happened. But you was
my older brother.

886
00:53:40.482 --> 00:53:44.000
-you're supposed to protect me.
and not shoot me.
-Trey.

887
00:53:44.034 --> 00:53:46.758
All I could do for the last
11 years was think about

888
00:53:46.793 --> 00:53:49.655
what happened and how it all
could have been avoided.

889
00:53:49.689 --> 00:53:52.655
Nigga. this is just as much
your fault as it was mine.

890
00:53:52.689 --> 00:53:55.758
Why you ain't tell Collin
the truth about
what happened to Mom?

891
00:53:55.793 --> 00:53:58.655
-What do you want?
-What do I want?

892
00:53:58.689 --> 00:54:00.724
I want to have a wife.

893
00:54:00.758 --> 00:54:04.103
and I want my wife to have kids
and my kids to have kids.

894
00:54:04.137 --> 00:54:05.965
[grunts]
I want my life to matter.

895
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.724
And my life
to make a difference.

896
00:54:07.758 --> 00:54:08.793
That's what I want. Michael.

897
00:54:08.827 --> 00:54:10.965
Can you give me that? Huh?

898
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.965
That's my demands.

899
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.827
Trey. you there?

900
00:54:16.034 --> 00:54:17.310
Trey!

901
00:54:18.379 --> 00:54:21.000
Collin. they're shooting
into the house. [cries]

902
00:54:22.689 --> 00:54:24.896
We have no plan of getting out.

903
00:54:24.931 --> 00:54:27.517
What if they
shoot us by mistake?

904
00:54:27.551 --> 00:54:30.655
She's right.
I think it's time we end this.

905
00:54:31.586 --> 00:54:37.344
Just wait a minute. hold on
a second. There's got
to be another option.

906
00:54:37.379 --> 00:54:40.793
I don't know. Maybe we can callthe TV news and get them here soyou can tell them what happened.

907
00:54:40.827 --> 00:54:41.724
What really happened.

908
00:54:46.931 --> 00:54:50.827
Then what?
Then I do life in prison
and you guys go on with yours?

909
00:54:50.862 --> 00:54:54.517
Trey. don't give up. alright?
I mean hopefully Michael can
work this out.

910
00:54:54.551 --> 00:54:56.827
Yeah. right.
Mike just shot at us.

911
00:54:56.862 --> 00:54:59.551
But we don't actually know
if he pulled the trigger.

912
00:54:59.586 --> 00:55:02.413
So what?
His men are gonna shoot at us?

913
00:55:02.448 --> 00:55:05.413
He ain't got no other options.
He has no choices.

914
00:55:05.448 --> 00:55:08.172
Either I come out.
or they come I and kill me.

915
00:55:08.206 --> 00:55:11.551
[radio chatter]

916
00:55:14.931 --> 00:55:16.551
I'm just going to
make a run for it.

917
00:55:16.586 --> 00:55:17.758
Don't be stupid. man.

918
00:55:18.965 --> 00:55:21.034
They got the whole place
surrounded. and you go outside.

919
00:55:21.068 --> 00:55:23.034
they'll shot you on sight.
You understand me?

920
00:55:23.068 --> 00:55:24.034
Listen to me.

921
00:55:26.068 --> 00:55:27.068
I don't want
nothing to happen to you.

922
00:55:30.896 --> 00:55:32.689
Brother...

923
00:55:32.724 --> 00:55:34.068
I'm proud of you.

924
00:55:34.103 --> 00:55:37.034
You hear me? I'm proud
of the wife you married.

925
00:55:37.068 --> 00:55:39.896
I'm proud of the life
you created for yourself.

926
00:55:39.931 --> 00:55:40.896
I just want you to know
I love you.

927
00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:43.620
[Trey grunts]

928
00:55:45.724 --> 00:55:47.724
Trey. don't do it.

929
00:55:47.758 --> 00:55:49.758
I'm not never going
back to prison again.

930
00:55:49.793 --> 00:55:50.551
I love you. Collin.

931
00:55:51.551 --> 00:55:53.034
[phone buzzing]

932
00:55:58.586 --> 00:56:00.689
-Hello?
-[Mike] Collin.

933
00:56:02.965 --> 00:56:03.689
It's Michael.

934
00:56:07.655 --> 00:56:08.103
[Trey] Michael?

935
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:14.896
Trey. listen.
I talked to the Lieutenant.
He spoke to the mayor

936
00:56:14.931 --> 00:56:17.793
and they've agreed to give you
an extremely reduced sentence.
little brother.

937
00:56:17.827 --> 00:56:21.103
Prison's for criminals. Michael.And I ain't no criminal.

938
00:56:21.137 --> 00:56:24.965
Are you listening to yourself?
Are you listening to me?

939
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.965
You got to do. like.
six months. and go free.

940
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.689
Nobody gets hurt.
And all of this is over. man.

941
00:56:29.724 --> 00:56:31.862
You lied to me when you told me
to hide the gun.

942
00:56:31.896 --> 00:56:33.068
You told me
everything was gonna be okay.

943
00:56:33.103 --> 00:56:35.482
Now look at us. 11 years later

944
00:56:35.517 --> 00:56:38.103
and still lying to me. How am
I supposed to trust you now?

945
00:56:38.137 --> 00:56:40.758
Trey. I need you to
make a decision now.

946
00:56:40.793 --> 00:56:41.862
I've done all I can do.

947
00:56:47.965 --> 00:56:48.793
Baby. get down.

948
00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:52.931
[Collin] Whoa!

949
00:56:52.965 --> 00:56:53.793
What are you doing?

950
00:56:55.827 --> 00:56:57.793
Trey. You're making a mistake.

951
00:56:59.172 --> 00:57:01.655
-I'd rather die
than go back to prison.
-[Collin] Trey. stop!

952
00:57:01.689 --> 00:57:02.689
Trey!

953
00:57:03.758 --> 00:57:06.172
I unlocked it earlier.
Michael made me.

954
00:57:06.206 --> 00:57:07.862
Please. please. please.

955
00:57:07.896 --> 00:57:10.103
-Easy. bro. Easy.
-No.

956
00:57:10.137 --> 00:57:11.793
-It was a mistake.
-Hey. Trey.

957
00:57:11.827 --> 00:57:13.103
The lights were the signal

958
00:57:13.137 --> 00:57:14.827
for Collin and I to get down.

959
00:57:14.862 --> 00:57:16.172
-Hey. look at me.
-I ain't going back.

960
00:57:16.206 --> 00:57:18.000
Look at me. look at me.
Hey. look at me.

961
00:57:22.310 --> 00:57:23.827
I have a shot.

962
00:57:23.862 --> 00:57:26.000
I'm so sorry. So sorry.

963
00:57:26.034 --> 00:57:29.655
-[sniper] Do I take the shot?
-I heard you. Give me a second.

964
00:57:29.689 --> 00:57:31.000
[sniper] It's going to go away.
Do I take the shot now?

965
00:57:34.827 --> 00:57:36.827
I said. give me a second.

966
00:57:36.862 --> 00:57:38.827
-[Collin] Easy.
-Please.

967
00:57:38.862 --> 00:57:39.896
-Easy.
-I'm not going back.

968
00:57:42.206 --> 00:57:44.862
[tense music]

969
00:57:48.724 --> 00:57:49.862
Take the shot.

970
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000
Easy. easy.

971
00:57:57.862 --> 00:57:59.034
-Get down!
-[gunshot]

972
00:57:59.068 --> 00:58:01.034
-Collin!
-Damn!

973
00:58:01.068 --> 00:58:02.344
The home owner
jumped in the way of the shot.

974
00:58:02.379 --> 00:58:04.586
What? Who got hit?

975
00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:07.206
Mike! The wife locked the back
door. we couldn't get in.

976
00:58:07.241 --> 00:58:09.931
-She what?
-She locked the back door.
We heard her do it.

977
00:58:09.965 --> 00:58:11.793
You got to be kidding me.

978
00:58:17.965 --> 00:58:20.655
-[Collin grunts]
-[Vanessa] Collin! Baby.

979
00:58:20.689 --> 00:58:27.000
-Help me lift him.
-You're going to be all right.

980
00:58:27.034 --> 00:58:30.896
-What were you thinking?
-I'm just doing what
a brother's supposed to do.

981
00:58:30.931 --> 00:58:33.724
Trey. I'm all
out of options. man.

982
00:58:33.758 --> 00:58:35.344
I can't have
anyone else get hurt.

983
00:58:35.379 --> 00:58:37.931
so I didn't you to
come out with your hands up

984
00:58:37.965 --> 00:58:39.896
or we're coming in.
It's your choice.

985
00:58:41.068 --> 00:58:43.793
You got ten minutes
to decide. starting now.

986
00:58:44.896 --> 00:58:46.344
[Vanessa] Baby. baby. baby.

987
00:58:46.379 --> 00:58:47.758
They're about to come in.
We got to move him.

988
00:58:47.793 --> 00:58:49.896
Trey. go get my bag!

989
00:58:49.931 --> 00:58:51.965
-[Collin grunts]
-It's all right. baby.

990
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.586
-I have to stitch him up.
please go.
-Where's the bag?

991
00:58:54.620 --> 00:58:56.241
It's in the second door
to the right. Please.

992
00:58:56.275 --> 00:58:58.931
-[Collin grunts]
-Please. please. I'm so sorry.

993
00:58:58.965 --> 00:59:00.965
I have to apply the pressure
to stop the blood.

994
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.620
So look at me. look at me.
stay with me. please.

995
00:59:11.379 --> 00:59:14.103
-Get the gas and the goggles
out. we're going in.
-Yes. sir.

996
00:59:16.068 --> 00:59:18.275
-[groans]
-Please stay still.

997
00:59:18.310 --> 00:59:20.931
Please. please. I'm almost done.

998
00:59:20.965 --> 00:59:23.310
-Okay.
-We can't numb it?

999
00:59:23.344 --> 00:59:25.655
No. I need you to
hold the muscles please.

1000
00:59:26.827 --> 00:59:28.965
[groans]

1001
00:59:33.275 --> 00:59:35.068
-Breathe.
-Okay.

1002
00:59:35.103 --> 00:59:37.655
-Breathe. Breathe.
-Okay. All right.

1003
00:59:37.689 --> 00:59:40.655
-Good.
-Remember when Mom
used to sneak us out of school

1004
00:59:40.689 --> 00:59:43.310
on her lunch break. and take
us swimming at the lake?

1005
00:59:43.344 --> 00:59:46.241
And we used to go underwater
and hold our breath and see who
could do it the longest.

1006
00:59:46.275 --> 00:59:49.000
You always win.

1007
00:59:49.034 --> 00:59:53.275
And Michael's too afraid to go
swimming. So she only take us.

1008
00:59:53.310 --> 00:59:55.793
Then we used to come back
to school with our hair
soaking wet.

1009
00:59:55.827 --> 00:59:58.827
We told the teacher we had to
go to the bathroom really bad.

1010
00:59:58.862 --> 01:00:00.068
[chuckles] She probably thought
we fell in. huh?

1011
01:00:00.103 --> 01:00:02.103
[Collin laughs] Yes.

1012
01:00:02.137 --> 01:00:04.827
Please stop making him laugh.

1013
01:00:04.862 --> 01:00:06.000
-You have to stay still. baby.
-Okay.

1014
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.275
She said. it would
save your life one day.

1015
01:00:20.206 --> 01:00:21.793
-[Collin groans]
-I'm all done. baby.

1016
01:00:23.103 --> 01:00:24.655
[glass breaking]

1017
01:00:24.689 --> 01:00:26.000
Run. Trey!

1018
01:00:47.793 --> 01:00:48.655
[Mike] Trey?

1019
01:00:51.034 --> 01:00:51.965
We're getting
the house surrounded.

1020
01:00:53.275 --> 01:00:54.793
I want to warn you.

1021
01:00:55.896 --> 01:00:57.827
If you keep fighting.
you're dead.

1022
01:00:57.862 --> 01:00:59.000
So you better find us.

1023
01:01:31.862 --> 01:01:32.862
[whack]

1024
01:01:44.172 --> 01:01:47.172
-Oh. baby. You go.
-[Vanessa coughs]

1025
01:01:49.344 --> 01:01:54.310
No. Stay with me.

1026
01:01:54.344 --> 01:01:55.862
[crying]

1027
01:02:12.275 --> 01:02:13.965
[Trey] I did everything for you!

1028
01:02:18.137 --> 01:02:19.241
[gunshot]

1029
01:02:23.965 --> 01:02:25.103
Ah!

1030
01:02:31.586 --> 01:02:33.000
[both coughing]

1031
01:02:46.137 --> 01:02:48.931
For the last 11 years...

1032
01:02:50.275 --> 01:02:51.931
I thought about that night.
how the gun went off.

1033
01:02:53.586 --> 01:02:55.206
And you thought it was my fault.

1034
01:02:55.241 --> 01:02:56.413
[Michael coughs]

1035
01:02:59.103 --> 01:03:01.931
You got Mom involved.

1036
01:03:01.965 --> 01:03:05.137
You told her what I was involvedin and what my life was like.

1037
01:03:05.172 --> 01:03:06.379
and that's why she
started getting high.

1038
01:03:09.344 --> 01:03:12.172
I was trying to keep Mom clean.

1039
01:03:12.206 --> 01:03:14.482
But you only saw
what you wanted to see.

1040
01:03:14.517 --> 01:03:17.827
Not what was really going on.
And now she's dead.
because of you.

1041
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.310
Not me... you.

1042
01:03:25.551 --> 01:03:27.137
You should have
never got involved.

1043
01:03:36.068 --> 01:03:36.827
I did it for you.

1044
01:03:43.689 --> 01:03:46.068
[Collin and Vanessa cough]

1045
01:03:49.344 --> 01:03:50.241
[Mike]
Get an ambulance up here.

1046
01:03:54.241 --> 01:03:56.862
Cuff those two.
And get a bag for that.

1047
01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:09.310
I told Trey
I'd give him justice.

1048
01:04:11.413 --> 01:04:12.586
[gunshot]

1049
01:04:19.413 --> 01:04:22.068
-I love you. babe.
-I love you.

1050
01:04:22.103 --> 01:04:23.896
[Vanessa cries]

1051
01:04:25.241 --> 01:04:29.206
["everything i wanted"
by Billie Eilish playing]

1052
01:04:31.068 --> 01:04:33.413
[Vanessa] No! No!

1053
01:04:41.068 --> 01:04:43.448
[siren wailing]

1054
01:04:51.379 --> 01:04:53.241
Sorry. Lieutenant.

1055
01:04:53.275 --> 01:04:54.379
All three brothers
are dead. sir.

1056
01:04:56.068 --> 01:04:56.931
What do you mean?

1057
01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:02.103
