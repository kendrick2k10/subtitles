3
00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:35.936
My name is
Valentino Fagan.

4
00:00:39.207 --> 00:00:41.142
But friends and
family call me Val.

5
00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:48.982
I got the name Valentino

6
00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:51.352
'cause my ma loved the voice
of Francesco Valentino.

7
00:00:51.352 --> 00:00:52.186
the opera singer.

8
00:00:57.258 --> 00:00:58.726
I run Dublin city.

9
00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:06.834
I decide what happens.

10
00:01:08.236 --> 00:01:09.770
Hey. where
are you going. hey?

11
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.039
Where the fuck are you going?
Where the fuck are you going?

12
00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:13.374
Val. man. please. I
haven't said anything.

13
00:01:13.374 --> 00:01:15.876
I promise. I won't
say any. fuck. please!

14
00:01:18.512 --> 00:01:19.447
Get down!

15
00:01:19.447 --> 00:01:21.415
'Cause this is my city

16
00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:24.485
and no one is gonna
take it from me.

17
00:01:58.018 --> 00:02:02.923
* There's chaos in the streets

18
00:02:03.824 --> 00:02:08.362
* There's blood on their hands

19
00:02:09.263 --> 00:02:13.801
* I feel a tide is coming

20
00:02:14.702 --> 00:02:19.273
* And no one understands

21
00:02:19.907 --> 00:02:24.578
* It's my city

22
00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:30.150
* No one's gonna
take it from me *

23
00:02:30.784 --> 00:02:35.756
* My city

24
00:02:35.756 --> 00:02:40.594
* And no one's gonna take it

25
00:02:40.594 --> 00:02:42.763
* From me

26
00:02:52.373 --> 00:02:54.908
* Chaos in the streets

27
00:02:54.908 --> 00:02:57.478
* Blood on their hands

28
00:02:57.478 --> 00:03:00.113
* I feel a storm is coming

29
00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:02.783
* And no one understands

30
00:03:02.783 --> 00:03:07.788
* It's my city

31
00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.327
* No one's gonna
take it from me *

32
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:18.532
* It's my city

33
00:03:19.433 --> 00:03:23.737
* And no one's gonna take it

34
00:03:24.372 --> 00:03:26.674
* From me

35
00:03:36.384 --> 00:03:38.552
This shower are
the bane of my life.

36
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.124
The inevitable thorn
in my side. the Garda.

37
00:03:45.593 --> 00:03:48.028
For years. these scumbags have
been chasing me and the boys.

38
00:03:48.028 --> 00:03:49.697
trying to get us locked up.

39
00:03:49.697 --> 00:03:51.965
They harass us at every turn.

40
00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:56.604
Searching us. searching our
gaffs. searching our cars.

41
00:03:56.604 --> 00:03:58.572
and especially dicks
like this fella. Hogan.

42
00:03:58.572 --> 00:04:00.207
and his partner. O'Neill.

43
00:04:02.876 --> 00:04:04.578
But the worse of them all.

44
00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:08.449
Detective Inspector
Liz Delahunt.

45
00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:10.117
This operation has been set up

46
00:04:10.117 --> 00:04:12.886
to target this man. Val Fagan.

47
00:04:12.886 --> 00:04:14.822
He is the biggest importer

48
00:04:14.822 --> 00:04:17.991
and distributor of
drugs in the country.

49
00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:20.994
Now. Fagan operates
the Irish end

50
00:04:20.994 --> 00:04:22.763
of a drugs distribution network

51
00:04:22.763 --> 00:04:25.265
for these two. the
Corrigan brothers.

52
00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.200
operating out of Amsterdam.

53
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.403
Things have escalated

54
00:04:29.403 --> 00:04:31.839
with the murder of
John Kilroy last night.

55
00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:34.141
Now. Kilroy was a money man

56
00:04:34.141 --> 00:04:37.110
in a money laundering racket
through a dodgy casino.

57
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.180
Unfortunately. Fagan
got to him first.

58
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.184
As for his gang. Fagan's
right-hand man is Alan Reynolds.

59
00:04:44.184 --> 00:04:47.688
Ex-army ranger. he's cautious.

60
00:04:47.688 --> 00:04:51.525
highly intelligent.
and extremely loyal.

61
00:04:51.525 --> 00:04:55.095
Dennis Keogh. aka
Carrot. Loudmouth scrote.

62
00:04:55.095 --> 00:04:58.031
Greg Cushion. aka Cushty.

63
00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:00.634
And then. we come to Mark Wells.

64
00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:02.770
He Fagan's main triggerman.

65
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.374
So we are gonna start at
the bottom of the pile

66
00:05:06.374 --> 00:05:08.075
with known street-level dealers

67
00:05:08.075 --> 00:05:10.177
like this fella. Bazza Hogg.

68
00:05:10.177 --> 00:05:13.180
and we are gonna
work our way up.

69
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.884
Because the goal here is
to get a charge on Fagan

70
00:05:16.884 --> 00:05:21.489
for directing an organized
crime group. okay?

71
00:05:22.656 --> 00:05:23.857
This tramp
first caught me

72
00:05:23.857 --> 00:05:25.493
in a stolen jammer
when I was 15.

73
00:05:27.428 --> 00:05:29.196
Me and the boys have
been trying to outrun her

74
00:05:29.196 --> 00:05:31.298
and her band of
merry men ever since.

75
00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:35.469
They hate us and we hate them.

76
00:05:38.038 --> 00:05:38.972
He in back there?

77
00:05:38.972 --> 00:05:40.408
In the office with the lads.

78
00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:48.949
It's going to be traveling
down from the north tomorrow.

79
00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:50.150
and it's full to
the fucking roof

80
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.521
with all these
ultra smart HD TVs.

81
00:05:53.521 --> 00:05:55.088
Now. I'm being told these go

82
00:05:55.088 --> 00:05:57.558
for anywhere up to a grand each

83
00:05:57.558 --> 00:05:59.927
and there's gotta be
nearly 200 of them already.

84
00:06:01.128 --> 00:06:02.863
That's last week's
takes for Bazza. yeah?

85
00:06:02.863 --> 00:06:03.697
Right.

86
00:06:05.132 --> 00:06:08.436
Now. with these TVs. I make
that up to 200 grand's worth.

87
00:06:08.436 --> 00:06:10.103
That's a nice earning
for all of us.

88
00:06:10.103 --> 00:06:11.338
When did you say
it was heading down?

89
00:06:11.338 --> 00:06:12.940
Leaves Belfast in the morning.

90
00:06:15.543 --> 00:06:16.777
It's all there?

91
00:06:16.777 --> 00:06:18.311
It's a little bit light.

92
00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:19.847
Wanted to restock
them for this week

93
00:06:19.847 --> 00:06:21.815
and he said he'll make up
the difference next week.

94
00:06:21.815 --> 00:06:23.316
What's his excuse?

95
00:06:23.316 --> 00:06:25.819
Blaming Ringo for poaching
his customers or whatever.

96
00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:27.555
Apparently there's a bit of
grief between the two of them.

97
00:06:27.555 --> 00:06:30.891
I heard Ringo's sister
gave Baz's bird a few slaps.

98
00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:33.326
Women. Why am I not surprised?

99
00:06:37.498 --> 00:06:40.100
Right. There's that job
for you's in the morning.

100
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.703
Get geared up. Cushty and
Wellsy will fill you in.

101
00:06:42.703 --> 00:06:43.937
When the job's done. I want you

102
00:06:43.937 --> 00:06:46.339
to sort out and start
shifting the gear. yeah?

103
00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:47.708
Yeah.

104
00:06:47.708 --> 00:06:48.509
Right.

105
00:06:58.051 --> 00:06:59.587
Right.

106
00:06:59.587 --> 00:07:01.655
Dessie Corrigan was on the
blower to me this morning.

107
00:07:01.655 --> 00:07:03.323
He want's to go off
to Amsterdam tomorrow.

108
00:07:03.323 --> 00:07:04.458
About the shipment next week?

109
00:07:04.458 --> 00:07:05.292
I don't know.

110
00:07:06.494 --> 00:07:07.828
But I need you to
book his flights.

111
00:07:07.828 --> 00:07:09.129
Yeah. No bother.

112
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.199
Any word from your
pal in the Old Bill?

113
00:07:13.567 --> 00:07:15.869
Yeah. the cops are
upping their game on you.

114
00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:18.338
Liz Delahunt is
leading the charge.

115
00:07:20.674 --> 00:07:23.844
Renno's ability to gain
information is unbelievable.

116
00:07:23.844 --> 00:07:26.313
He has his ear to the
ground for everything.

117
00:07:26.313 --> 00:07:27.948
Whether it be from
a handle in the cops

118
00:07:27.948 --> 00:07:30.518
or listening to
talkers on the street.

119
00:07:30.518 --> 00:07:32.486
It's a valuable asset to have
that he can get a head's up

120
00:07:32.486 --> 00:07:34.488
and keep the wolves
away from my door.

121
00:07:36.256 --> 00:07:38.726
And that for me is
good for business.

122
00:07:45.098 --> 00:07:47.167
But some things aren't
good for business.

123
00:07:48.769 --> 00:07:50.070
Like this scumbag.

124
00:07:52.506 --> 00:07:53.541
Decco Cunningham.

125
00:07:55.042 --> 00:07:57.344
Probably the most
vile psychopath known.

126
00:07:58.712 --> 00:07:59.880
He got his fucked-up head

127
00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.448
after a prisoner jumped
him with a machete

128
00:08:01.448 --> 00:08:03.250
a week after Decco raped him.

129
00:08:04.117 --> 00:08:05.619
And although Decco lost an eye

130
00:08:05.619 --> 00:08:08.622
and was left with a face
like a well chewed toffo.

131
00:08:08.622 --> 00:08:11.058
Decco left him in a coma
with a fractured skull.

132
00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:20.200
Decco pal. you alright?

133
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.201
Got any nose?

134
00:08:22.269 --> 00:08:23.503
Any sniff?

135
00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:25.105
You think I'd fucking
let you down. do you?

136
00:08:27.708 --> 00:08:29.476
Good stuff that. as well.

137
00:08:29.476 --> 00:08:31.144
What's the plan for later?

138
00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:34.648
Round up the troops.

139
00:08:34.648 --> 00:08:36.416
I have a bit of work
for us in a few hours.

140
00:08:37.618 --> 00:08:38.752
He's
out now after serving

141
00:08:38.752 --> 00:08:40.688
eight years for manslaughter.

142
00:08:40.688 --> 00:08:44.357
And little do I know the
problems this man will cause me.

143
00:08:50.798 --> 00:08:52.733
Wellsy. go ahead with
Dessie in the morning. yeah?

144
00:08:52.733 --> 00:08:53.901
Yeah. no bother. pal.

145
00:08:53.901 --> 00:08:55.535
Myself and Renno
have to go to Amsterdam

146
00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:58.105
so you. Carrot. and Cushty
get yourselves sorted.

147
00:08:58.105 --> 00:08:59.673
Don't stay at home tonight.

148
00:08:59.673 --> 00:09:00.841
No problem here.

149
00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:03.677
Me and Carrot are
sorting the gear. yeah?

150
00:09:03.677 --> 00:09:05.512
Yeah. he'll sort that.

151
00:09:05.512 --> 00:09:06.814
No problem. come out.
I'll give you a shout

152
00:09:06.814 --> 00:09:08.281
when the job's done. yeah?

153
00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:10.117
Yeah. well listen. just
tell him I'm dying for a piss.

154
00:09:10.117 --> 00:09:12.352
- No problem. man.
- Yeah. I'll let you go.

155
00:09:16.289 --> 00:09:17.490
Where's Luca?

156
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:18.458
He's in his room.

157
00:09:21.028 --> 00:09:22.830
Jesus Christ. Tanya?

158
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.064
What?

159
00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:26.233
The hum in there.
That's disgusting.

160
00:09:26.233 --> 00:09:29.336
It was that Indian I had last
night. didn't agree with me.

161
00:09:30.971 --> 00:09:32.539
Oh. you didn't even flush it!

162
00:09:32.539 --> 00:09:35.275
Al-fucking-right.
I'll flush it now. so.

163
00:09:35.275 --> 00:09:37.077
Well. I tell you. the next
time the pipes get blocked.

164
00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:38.646
I'll unclog it with
your fucking head!

165
00:09:38.646 --> 00:09:40.413
Yeah. yeah.

166
00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.482
Despite
all I am and what I do.

167
00:09:44.985 --> 00:09:46.486
Alright. champ?

168
00:09:46.486 --> 00:09:47.721
Hi. Dad.

169
00:09:47.721 --> 00:09:48.889
The
one thing that tops

170
00:09:48.889 --> 00:09:51.424
everything in my
life is my son. Luca.

171
00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:52.826
What are you playing?

172
00:09:52.826 --> 00:09:54.928
My greatest
honor is being his da.

173
00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:56.664
And for everything I
ever held in my arms.

174
00:09:56.664 --> 00:09:58.131
the best by far is him.

175
00:09:59.266 --> 00:10:02.202
Nothing or no one
can ever change that.

176
00:10:05.372 --> 00:10:06.774
And the same goes for Renno.

177
00:10:08.541 --> 00:10:10.577
You might think me and him
are the closest of mates

178
00:10:10.577 --> 00:10:11.611
and I suppose we are.

179
00:10:13.681 --> 00:10:14.882
But there's one
person in his life

180
00:10:14.882 --> 00:10:16.516
he puts ahead of
everything else.

181
00:10:17.985 --> 00:10:18.986
His wife Esther.

182
00:10:21.722 --> 00:10:22.823
- Hey.
- Hey.

183
00:10:22.823 --> 00:10:24.291
- Cuba?
- Mm.

184
00:10:24.291 --> 00:10:27.027
Jeez. do you remember the
last time we were there?

185
00:10:27.027 --> 00:10:28.896
Put some greasy
fucker in his hole.

186
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.299
Dislocated his shoulder
and broke his teeth.

187
00:10:32.299 --> 00:10:34.567
Yeah. well. he was trying to
steal my handbag. wasn't he?

188
00:10:34.567 --> 00:10:36.837
Yeah. well he was
a big fucker. though.

189
00:10:38.806 --> 00:10:41.074
You know. I don't think you're
afraid of anything. are you?

190
00:10:42.843 --> 00:10:44.477
By the way. I have to go
to Amsterdam tomorrow.

191
00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:46.279
Will you be gone long?

192
00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:48.148
Depends on Val.

193
00:11:26.319 --> 00:11:27.687
Oh. fuck's sake.
I didn't do it!

194
00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:29.757
Oh yeah? What's this then?

195
00:11:29.757 --> 00:11:30.891
I dunno. it's not mine.

196
00:11:30.891 --> 00:11:32.125
My bollocks they're not yours.

197
00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:35.162
I swear to God!

198
00:11:35.162 --> 00:11:36.429
Bit tight. innit?

199
00:11:36.429 --> 00:11:37.630
Bazza. you're under
arrest for an offense

200
00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:39.332
under Section 15 of the
Misuse of Drugs Act.

201
00:11:39.332 --> 00:11:41.634
You're not obliged to
say anything unless
you wish to do so

202
00:11:41.634 --> 00:11:43.136
but anything you do say will
be taken down in writing

203
00:11:43.136 --> 00:11:44.437
and may be used as evidence.

204
00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:51.378
Oh. I already have
a suspended sentence.

205
00:11:51.378 --> 00:11:52.780
I can't get locked
up for this one.

206
00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.347
Well that's your problem.

207
00:11:54.347 --> 00:11:55.849
For fuck's sake!

208
00:11:55.849 --> 00:11:57.717
Unless you wanna come
clean with where you got it.

209
00:12:00.888 --> 00:12:02.790
You're gonna be
charged for this.

210
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:04.357
And we'd be lucky to
keep you in custody.

211
00:12:04.357 --> 00:12:06.259
But if you wanna get
something off your chest.

212
00:12:06.259 --> 00:12:08.561
we might be able to sort
station bail for you.

213
00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:12.499
Fucking TVs. yeah?

214
00:12:12.499 --> 00:12:13.333
What?

215
00:12:14.835 --> 00:12:17.370
Carrot is supposed
to be getting his hands

216
00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:19.840
on a load of these
high-end smart TVs.

217
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.141
Dunno what the story is on them.

218
00:12:21.141 --> 00:12:23.343
but he asked me to
shift a load for him.

219
00:12:25.345 --> 00:12:26.546
That's all I know. yeah?

220
00:12:50.403 --> 00:12:52.605
Alright. buddy?

221
00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:54.842
Pop over here.
Get in. you fucking prick!

222
00:12:57.277 --> 00:12:59.712
Get the fuck
off me. you fairy.

223
00:12:59.712 --> 00:13:01.714
Sit there now.
come on. hands out.

224
00:13:01.714 --> 00:13:03.750
Come on. come on. come on.
hands out. there we go.

225
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:06.053
Now. keep your
mouth shut. alright?

226
00:13:06.053 --> 00:13:08.655
Or we'll have to fucking
tape that up as well. yeah?

227
00:13:08.655 --> 00:13:11.391
Good man. you're
doing great. buddy.

228
00:13:11.391 --> 00:13:13.326
Where's your fucking license?

229
00:13:13.326 --> 00:13:15.262
It's up in the
windscreen visor.

230
00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:23.170
We know who you
fucking are. yeah?

231
00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:24.972
Now we know where
you fucking live too.

232
00:13:24.972 --> 00:13:26.606
You go to the fucking Guards.

233
00:13:26.606 --> 00:13:29.542
we're gonna come to your house
and ride your wife. alright?

234
00:13:30.978 --> 00:13:33.380
My wife passed away
about a year ago.

235
00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.715
Aw. boo fucking hoo!

236
00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:38.285
Then we'll dig her up. so.

237
00:13:38.285 --> 00:13:41.889
And then we'll fucking
ride her!

238
00:13:41.889 --> 00:13:44.524
Let's get this fucking
car on the road. huh?

239
00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.197
Oh! Jesus!

240
00:13:50.197 --> 00:13:51.731
Won't go into fucking gear. man.

241
00:13:51.731 --> 00:13:52.966
There's nothing wrong with it.

242
00:13:52.966 --> 00:13:55.502
it's your fucking head
won't go into gear!

243
00:13:55.502 --> 00:13:57.637
Are you
for fucking real?

244
00:13:57.637 --> 00:13:59.940
If you wanna drive.
then fucking drive.

245
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.943
Just shut up and fucking
drive the thing. will you?

246
00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:06.713
Yeah? What's the story?

247
00:14:06.713 --> 00:14:08.815
- All good. yeah?
- All good here.

248
00:14:08.815 --> 00:14:10.050
Yeah. just bring him
down the back roads

249
00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:11.351
and dump him out
somewhere. yeah?

250
00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:13.686
Alright. good
man. see you up there.

251
00:15:03.103 --> 00:15:04.938
So. do you rent this
place out or what?

252
00:15:04.938 --> 00:15:05.905
I own it.

253
00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:06.940
- Do you?
- Yeah.

254
00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:08.675
So. security's good. you know?

255
00:15:08.675 --> 00:15:10.810
Yeah. the top
floor is private.

256
00:15:12.812 --> 00:15:13.713
Hi. Gitzer.

257
00:15:15.048 --> 00:15:16.283
Hi. Val.

258
00:15:16.283 --> 00:15:17.550
I see the lads
are here already.

259
00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:19.519
Yeah. They're over there.

260
00:15:19.519 --> 00:15:20.787
You wait here
with Gitzer. yeah?

261
00:15:20.787 --> 00:15:24.257
No worries. Gitzer.
good to see you again.

262
00:15:24.257 --> 00:15:26.293
How's things holding
up on your end?

263
00:15:26.293 --> 00:15:27.660
Up and down. Renno.

264
00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.296
- Yeah?
- Fucking Moroccan cunts

265
00:15:29.296 --> 00:15:30.530
are giving grief.

266
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:31.898
Dessie and Noel are
up the walls about it

267
00:15:31.898 --> 00:15:33.733
'cause they're in bed
with the Russians.

268
00:15:33.733 --> 00:15:35.402
Oh. and what's
the story there?

269
00:15:36.836 --> 00:15:39.072
The story is. the Russians
are shipping Moroccan product

270
00:15:39.072 --> 00:15:40.907
onto the continent
through Eastern Europe

271
00:15:40.907 --> 00:15:42.909
and Dessie and Noel are
not one bit happy about it.

272
00:15:42.909 --> 00:15:45.012
Hm. Yeah. I can only imagine.

273
00:15:45.012 --> 00:15:46.513
It was seized?

274
00:15:46.513 --> 00:15:49.983
Yep. The DEA in the States
were keeping tabs on it

275
00:15:49.983 --> 00:15:52.119
when it left Bolivia.

276
00:15:52.119 --> 00:15:54.954
They hit it as soon as it
was in international waters.

277
00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:56.156
How much?

278
00:15:56.156 --> 00:15:57.224
20 tons of it.

279
00:15:57.224 --> 00:15:59.726
Jesus Christ. 20 tons of coke?

280
00:15:59.726 --> 00:16:00.927
Yep.

281
00:16:00.927 --> 00:16:02.295
So where does that leave us?

282
00:16:02.295 --> 00:16:03.830
Not good.

283
00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:06.399
That consignment was meant
to supply most of Europe.

284
00:16:06.399 --> 00:16:07.967
You were meant to be
getting some for this week.

285
00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:09.602
Yeah. that's right.

286
00:16:09.602 --> 00:16:12.239
Thing is. Val. we
need everyone to pull
together on this.

287
00:16:12.239 --> 00:16:13.873
We need to get back
onto the South Americans

288
00:16:13.873 --> 00:16:15.908
to get a new and
bigger consignment.

289
00:16:15.908 --> 00:16:18.145
To make up for the shortfall.

290
00:16:18.145 --> 00:16:20.047
But we need to get
the funds together.

291
00:16:21.948 --> 00:16:23.983
How much are you's talking?

292
00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:26.153
Look. everyone has to chip in.

293
00:16:26.153 --> 00:16:27.820
Now. I know this is asking a lot

294
00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:30.323
but we need you to come
up with seven figures.

295
00:16:35.395 --> 00:16:36.729
A million quid?

296
00:16:36.729 --> 00:16:39.766
Val. I know it's
a lot of money.

297
00:16:39.766 --> 00:16:41.734
But do whatever
you can to get it.

298
00:16:41.734 --> 00:16:43.036
Look at it this way. Val.

299
00:16:43.036 --> 00:16:44.771
we know you're doing
a good job back home

300
00:16:44.771 --> 00:16:46.073
and you're running a tight ship

301
00:16:46.073 --> 00:16:47.840
and everything is in order.

302
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.509
and we admire that.

303
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:51.378
But you pull through
on this with us

304
00:16:51.378 --> 00:16:52.679
and it won't be forgotten.

305
00:16:55.482 --> 00:16:59.186
However. Val. and you can take
this whatever way you want.

306
00:16:59.186 --> 00:17:01.088
you don't do this for us.

307
00:17:01.088 --> 00:17:02.889
then we find someone
else that will.

308
00:17:04.057 --> 00:17:05.592
You get what we're saying here?

309
00:17:09.562 --> 00:17:11.631
When do you need
this money by?

310
00:17:11.631 --> 00:17:13.166
Within the next month.

311
00:17:17.237 --> 00:17:21.308
Fuck it. yeah. I'll
see what I can do.

312
00:17:21.308 --> 00:17:23.076
Fair play to you. Val.

313
00:17:23.076 --> 00:17:24.944
I know you won't let us down.

314
00:17:24.944 --> 00:17:26.813
You're a
good team player. Val.

315
00:17:26.813 --> 00:17:28.115
We appreciate this.

316
00:17:31.818 --> 00:17:33.420
Liz?

317
00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.021
I was just talking
to Kevin Hogan.

318
00:17:35.021 --> 00:17:36.823
He told me he gave
Bazza Hogg station bail

319
00:17:36.823 --> 00:17:38.091
on that drug capture.

320
00:17:38.091 --> 00:17:39.292
Yes. that's right.

321
00:17:39.292 --> 00:17:41.094
Well. why? He's known
for sale and supply.

322
00:17:41.094 --> 00:17:42.829
Because I advised him to.

323
00:17:42.829 --> 00:17:44.931
We're tasked with getting
people like Hogg off the streets

324
00:17:44.931 --> 00:17:46.133
and I think Kevin
Hogan should've-

325
00:17:46.133 --> 00:17:48.868
Whatever Kevin Hogan
does or doesn't do

326
00:17:48.868 --> 00:17:51.404
is none of your concern. Seamus.

327
00:17:53.306 --> 00:17:55.007
Is there something else?

328
00:17:55.007 --> 00:17:56.476
Yeah.

329
00:17:56.476 --> 00:17:58.511
The Super dropped
this in to me earlier.

330
00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:03.950
Fuck's sake!

331
00:18:08.855 --> 00:18:11.658
- No. no. no.
- You're cutting our budget?!

332
00:18:11.658 --> 00:18:12.692
My hands are tied.

333
00:18:12.692 --> 00:18:14.561
Well un-fucking-tie them!

334
00:18:14.561 --> 00:18:17.464
I have the Chief breathing
down my neck on this.

335
00:18:17.464 --> 00:18:19.532
There's nothing I can do.

336
00:18:19.532 --> 00:18:22.169
The Chief is lining
up his own promotion

337
00:18:22.169 --> 00:18:25.405
and meanwhile Val Fagan is
allowed to wander around

338
00:18:25.405 --> 00:18:28.908
doing whatever he
bloody well likes.

339
00:18:28.908 --> 00:18:30.810
I don't know what
to tell you. Liz.

340
00:18:38.718 --> 00:18:40.153
And now. like myself.

341
00:18:40.153 --> 00:18:42.622
the cops are hit with their
own financial burdens.

342
00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:45.192
And by the time Renno and
me land back into Dublin.

343
00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:48.595
I feel the pressure of
the Corrigans' task.

344
00:18:50.497 --> 00:18:52.365
But Renno gives me
a glimmer of hope.

345
00:18:58.705 --> 00:19:00.873
So the place is like
fucking Fort Knox.

346
00:19:00.873 --> 00:19:03.410
Every stronghold has
its weak points. Val.

347
00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:04.744
And you think
this can be done?

348
00:19:04.744 --> 00:19:05.978
I wouldn't have mentioned it

349
00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:07.514
if I didn't think
we can pull it off.

350
00:19:09.616 --> 00:19:11.117
Tell me what you're thinking.

351
00:19:11.117 --> 00:19:12.585
Right. at least seven men.

352
00:19:12.585 --> 00:19:14.120
Means you'll have to
roll your sleeves up

353
00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.622
and get your hands
dirty on this one. yeah?

354
00:19:15.622 --> 00:19:16.456
Right.

355
00:19:16.456 --> 00:19:17.457
We need a mix of tools

356
00:19:17.457 --> 00:19:19.892
and at least two
automatic yokes.

357
00:19:19.892 --> 00:19:21.928
It's gonna be some job to
source that kind of firepower

358
00:19:21.928 --> 00:19:23.530
without the Old Bill
getting a sniff of it.

359
00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:24.864
Yeah. I was thinking that.

360
00:19:24.864 --> 00:19:26.933
Still have a couple
of contacts in the RA.

361
00:19:26.933 --> 00:19:28.268
They'll probably
look for a small cut

362
00:19:28.268 --> 00:19:29.602
after the job is done.

363
00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:34.874
Yeah.

364
00:19:34.874 --> 00:19:36.376
Yeah?

365
00:19:36.376 --> 00:19:37.844
Set up a meeting. see what
they have to say about it.

366
00:19:37.844 --> 00:19:38.678
No bother.

367
00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.250
Right. quick piss then
a couple of pints. yeah?

368
00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:44.116
Renno.

369
00:19:44.116 --> 00:19:45.051
Yeah?

370
00:19:45.051 --> 00:19:46.953
Thanks. You're a good mate.

371
00:19:46.953 --> 00:19:49.088
Everything you do for
me. I appreciate it.

372
00:19:49.088 --> 00:19:50.290
Don't mention it. pal.

373
00:19:57.664 --> 00:20:01.501
As for Decco
Cunningham. you might recall

374
00:20:01.501 --> 00:20:02.602
a bit of work he had lined up

375
00:20:02.602 --> 00:20:04.671
for him and his goons.

376
00:20:04.671 --> 00:20:05.505
Oi!

377
00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.841
- Don't move!
- You hear me?

378
00:20:08.841 --> 00:20:10.109
- You're coming with us.
- Keep your hands down.

379
00:20:10.109 --> 00:20:11.678
Right. you're coming
with me. come here.

380
00:20:11.678 --> 00:20:13.413
- Get 'em up.
- Come here!

381
00:20:13.413 --> 00:20:15.448
Don't resist me. do you hear me?

382
00:20:17.984 --> 00:20:20.119
A tiger kidnapping.

383
00:20:20.119 --> 00:20:21.721
When he was locked up.
Decco got a whisper

384
00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:23.790
of a soft touch for a stroke.

385
00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:26.058
Northern Cross Dog Track.

386
00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:27.727
And the only way to
the dog track's safe

387
00:20:27.727 --> 00:20:29.095
was through the manager.

388
00:20:29.095 --> 00:20:31.230
And this is your wife. Marie.

389
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.633
We've been watching you
for quite a while now.

390
00:20:33.633 --> 00:20:35.635
Guess what I'm gonna do
with your bitch wife?

391
00:20:35.635 --> 00:20:37.570
I'm gonna take her head off.

392
00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.273
And just to show you
we mean business.

393
00:20:40.273 --> 00:20:42.108
- No. no!
- No!

394
00:20:42.108 --> 00:20:42.909
No!

395
00:20:44.877 --> 00:20:46.679
Decco knows the
safe is on a time lock

396
00:20:46.679 --> 00:20:49.048
so he separates and holds
them 'til next morning.

397
00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:55.254
We're gonna take
her with us now. yeah?

398
00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:57.056
He then gives
the manager instructions.

399
00:20:57.056 --> 00:20:58.558
Take this phone.

400
00:20:58.558 --> 00:21:00.460
Tells him if he
wants to see his wife again.

401
00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:01.928
he'll do exactly as he says.

402
00:21:03.129 --> 00:21:05.598
Say goodbye to
your wife the last time.

403
00:21:06.633 --> 00:21:08.468
As for the box?

404
00:21:08.468 --> 00:21:11.338
So the neighbors don't see
the wife being taken away.

405
00:21:11.338 --> 00:21:13.239
Hurry the fuck up.

406
00:21:13.239 --> 00:21:15.442
Get every single bit of
that money in that safe.

407
00:21:15.442 --> 00:21:16.843
I am. I'm
getting it all now.

408
00:21:16.843 --> 00:21:17.977
Shut the fuck up!

409
00:21:17.977 --> 00:21:19.245
And this
fella's shitting himself

410
00:21:19.245 --> 00:21:20.313
and just wants to
see his wife again

411
00:21:20.313 --> 00:21:22.114
so he does exactly as he's told.

412
00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:23.550
I have it all.

413
00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:25.752
Go out the
side door to the car park

414
00:21:25.752 --> 00:21:27.787
and put the bag in the boot.

415
00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:29.956
close the boot. and walk away.

416
00:21:32.725 --> 00:21:34.361
Don't look at the driver

417
00:21:34.361 --> 00:21:37.296
or you'll be sent pieces
of your wife in the post.

418
00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:38.865
Now. fuck off!

419
00:21:38.865 --> 00:21:41.834
Oi. oi! My wife. Marie!

420
00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:52.645
Once Decco has the money

421
00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:54.481
they dump the wife out
in the middle of nowhere.

422
00:22:02.121 --> 00:22:04.290
Decco put the fear of
God into that couple.

423
00:22:07.126 --> 00:22:10.062
And he and his crew just made
over 100k for a night's work.

424
00:22:42.395 --> 00:22:43.630
Armed Gardai!

425
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.164
Get on the ground.
get on the fucking-

426
00:22:45.164 --> 00:22:46.399
- Alright. yeah!
- Get on the ground!

427
00:22:46.399 --> 00:22:48.768
Face down on the
ground. Stay down.

428
00:22:48.768 --> 00:22:50.670
- I'm fucking doing it.
- Yeah. alright.

429
00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:51.971
Fuck's sake.

430
00:22:51.971 --> 00:22:53.740
I'm hardly going anywhere.
Shut up!

431
00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.708
- Wankers.
- We all good?

432
00:23:08.154 --> 00:23:10.757
So. How are things with you?

433
00:23:11.924 --> 00:23:13.159
Well. it's like this. Dennis.

434
00:23:13.159 --> 00:23:14.861
you have just been
caught in possession

435
00:23:14.861 --> 00:23:18.798
of over 100.000 euros'
worth of stolen televisions.

436
00:23:18.798 --> 00:23:22.602
We also know that you have
been skimming off the top

437
00:23:22.602 --> 00:23:26.072
of Val's drug payments and
then blaming the street dealers

438
00:23:26.072 --> 00:23:27.707
for coming up short.

439
00:23:37.183 --> 00:23:40.386
Cigire. a call just came
through. A tiger kidnapping.

440
00:23:40.386 --> 00:23:42.522
The manager of the Northern
Cross Greyhound Stadium.

441
00:23:42.522 --> 00:23:43.923
Well. it couldn't
have been Fagan.

442
00:23:43.923 --> 00:23:46.726
he's only back from Amsterdam.
and we've Carrot here.

443
00:23:46.726 --> 00:23:48.227
But who's out there
dealing with it now?

444
00:23:48.227 --> 00:23:49.929
Local DDU and Scenes of Crime.

445
00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:52.832
Okay. well keep me posted

446
00:23:52.832 --> 00:23:55.101
on any further updates.
please. Aisling.

447
00:23:55.101 --> 00:23:55.902
Kevin. a word.

448
00:23:59.405 --> 00:24:01.207
If we get Carrot talking.

449
00:24:01.207 --> 00:24:03.643
he is to deal with
you personally

450
00:24:03.643 --> 00:24:05.144
and no one else. okay?

451
00:24:06.613 --> 00:24:09.015
Let's keep our cards close
to our chests on this one.

452
00:24:09.015 --> 00:24:11.417
Strictly on a need to
know basis and right now.

453
00:24:11.417 --> 00:24:14.153
only you and I need to know.

454
00:24:14.153 --> 00:24:15.154
Yeah. of course. Cigire.

455
00:24:15.154 --> 00:24:15.988
Okay. good man.

456
00:24:20.359 --> 00:24:21.561
Despite me not knowing

457
00:24:21.561 --> 00:24:23.329
about Carrot's fuck
up with the TVs.

458
00:24:25.364 --> 00:24:26.799
I'm more concerned
about how Renno got on

459
00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:28.935
in his meeting with
his IRA contacts.

460
00:24:30.102 --> 00:24:31.203
How did it go?

461
00:24:31.203 --> 00:24:32.872
Yeah. it's looking good.

462
00:24:32.872 --> 00:24:34.507
Had to run a bloody
army council. but.

463
00:24:34.507 --> 00:24:36.042
shouldn't be a problem.

464
00:24:36.042 --> 00:24:38.477
Good stuff. Put the wheels
in motion for it now. yeah?

465
00:24:39.912 --> 00:24:42.048
The best thing you can do.
Renno. is go to ground.

466
00:24:42.048 --> 00:24:43.282
Go off-radar altogether

467
00:24:43.282 --> 00:24:45.752
until you think it's
time to move on this.

468
00:24:45.752 --> 00:24:47.887
And the less people that know
about it the better. as well.

469
00:24:47.887 --> 00:24:49.255
No problem.

470
00:24:49.255 --> 00:24:50.523
Fair bit of planning involved

471
00:24:50.523 --> 00:24:52.458
but I'll let you know
when it's ready. yeah?

472
00:24:52.458 --> 00:24:54.160
Alright. Do what
you have to do.

473
00:24:56.362 --> 00:24:59.265
Things
seem to be back on track.

474
00:24:59.265 --> 00:25:01.668
Then Carrot hits me with
his story about the TVs.

475
00:25:02.969 --> 00:25:04.470
What are you in a panic for?

476
00:25:05.672 --> 00:25:06.839
It's the lock-up. man.

477
00:25:06.839 --> 00:25:08.474
Think it got raided.
TVs are gone.

478
00:25:10.176 --> 00:25:12.979
You better be fucking
joking me. Carrot.

479
00:25:12.979 --> 00:25:14.614
I swear to God. Val.

480
00:25:14.614 --> 00:25:16.215
If I hadn't have done a
bleeding walkabout myself.

481
00:25:16.215 --> 00:25:17.784
I would've been bang to rights.

482
00:25:18.685 --> 00:25:20.452
Tell me exactly what happened.

483
00:25:20.452 --> 00:25:21.387
I was doing what you asked.

484
00:25:21.387 --> 00:25:22.855
I was going to get rid of them.

485
00:25:22.855 --> 00:25:24.891
But then I fucking decked the
cops scoping the place out

486
00:25:24.891 --> 00:25:26.693
in one of them
unmarked Mariah vans.

487
00:25:26.693 --> 00:25:28.494
How did you
know they were the cops?

488
00:25:28.494 --> 00:25:30.029
Because I fucking
spotted Hogan.

489
00:25:30.029 --> 00:25:31.698
He was fucking red-hot. he was.

490
00:25:35.101 --> 00:25:36.302
- They see you?
- No.

491
00:25:36.302 --> 00:25:37.403
Are you sure?

492
00:25:37.403 --> 00:25:39.438
100%. man.

493
00:25:39.438 --> 00:25:40.539
Who else knew
about the lockup?

494
00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:41.473
Nobody.

495
00:25:41.473 --> 00:25:42.975
Who knew about the TVs?

496
00:25:42.975 --> 00:25:45.211
I organized Bazza Hogg to
ship a few of them for us.

497
00:25:45.211 --> 00:25:46.145
Bazza Hogg?

498
00:25:46.145 --> 00:25:47.580
Yeah. who else. man?

499
00:25:53.519 --> 00:25:54.754
I
think it's time for me

500
00:25:54.754 --> 00:25:56.288
to do my own bit
of investigating.

501
00:25:59.959 --> 00:26:01.127
Enter Violet Coughlan.

502
00:26:02.662 --> 00:26:05.898
My brief and barrister
extraordinaire with
legs to die for.

503
00:26:09.301 --> 00:26:12.004
Valentino Fagan.
my favorite client.

504
00:26:12.004 --> 00:26:13.572
How are you this fine morning?

505
00:26:13.572 --> 00:26:15.041
Oh. you know me. Violet.

506
00:26:15.041 --> 00:26:16.976
All the better for seeing you.

507
00:26:16.976 --> 00:26:18.310
You look great.

508
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:20.212
- Thank you.
- You smell even better.

509
00:26:21.648 --> 00:26:24.216
You're such a charmer. So
what can I help you with?

510
00:26:24.216 --> 00:26:25.652
You fancy going for a spin?

511
00:26:26.786 --> 00:26:27.920
I'm meant to meet
some colleagues

512
00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.856
in the law library for lunch.

513
00:26:29.856 --> 00:26:32.091
But I'd be more than happy
to make an exception for you.

514
00:26:32.091 --> 00:26:33.492
Nice one.

515
00:26:52.278 --> 00:26:53.112
Holy fuck!

516
00:26:56.615 --> 00:26:58.751
I should have lunch like
this with you more often.

517
00:26:58.751 --> 00:27:00.252
Mm. Be my pleasure.

518
00:27:00.252 --> 00:27:01.453
Fucking sure.

519
00:27:02.855 --> 00:27:05.224
So. what was it you
were asking me about again

520
00:27:05.224 --> 00:27:06.859
before we got carried away?

521
00:27:06.859 --> 00:27:07.960
You know Bazza Hogg?

522
00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.428
Oh yeah?

523
00:27:09.428 --> 00:27:10.763
He got caught
with gear last week.

524
00:27:10.763 --> 00:27:12.198
did he get bail on it?

525
00:27:12.198 --> 00:27:14.400
Prosecution never
objected to bail.

526
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.235
They assumed the Guards
would look for custody

527
00:27:16.235 --> 00:27:18.204
with a suspended sentence
but they just looked for him

528
00:27:18.204 --> 00:27:20.740
to sign on twice daily.
surrender his passport

529
00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:22.108
and a few other conditions.

530
00:27:22.975 --> 00:27:24.410
They'll probably go to trial

531
00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:25.411
but it'll be another
year before that happens.

532
00:27:27.379 --> 00:27:28.781
So even with a
suspended sentence

533
00:27:28.781 --> 00:27:30.750
and caught with gear.
he still got bail?

534
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:31.583
Yeah.

535
00:27:35.755 --> 00:27:38.157
I don't
need any more convincing.

536
00:27:47.233 --> 00:27:48.701
This is a right mess.

537
00:27:50.536 --> 00:27:51.470
You think
it could be over

538
00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:52.905
what he gave us on the TVs?

539
00:27:52.905 --> 00:27:55.541
It's a
strong possibility.

540
00:27:57.844 --> 00:27:59.511
So what
do we do from here?

541
00:28:01.213 --> 00:28:03.682
We just have to wait
and see what comes in.

542
00:28:03.682 --> 00:28:04.917
I mean. without
the proper budget.

543
00:28:04.917 --> 00:28:07.119
this operation is moving
at a snail's pace.

544
00:28:08.687 --> 00:28:09.922
All we have is Carrot.

545
00:28:09.922 --> 00:28:11.724
and I don't know if
he can be trusted.

546
00:28:13.359 --> 00:28:14.426
Come on.

547
00:28:20.967 --> 00:28:22.634
Get that into you.

548
00:28:22.634 --> 00:28:23.502
Get in it!

549
00:28:25.772 --> 00:28:27.006
Get it. Tanya.

550
00:28:27.006 --> 00:28:29.508
Oh yeah. that feels so good.

551
00:28:32.011 --> 00:28:33.545
Oh. I can feel it inside me.

552
00:28:33.545 --> 00:28:35.514
Tanya. would you
shut the fuck up?

553
00:28:45.591 --> 00:28:46.658
Is that it?

554
00:28:48.194 --> 00:28:49.461
What do you
mean. "Is that it?"

555
00:28:49.461 --> 00:28:51.563
Well. you were very
quick. what about me?

556
00:28:51.563 --> 00:28:53.732
What about you?
It's always about you!

557
00:28:54.901 --> 00:28:56.702
You're a selfish
fucking prick. Val.

558
00:28:57.603 --> 00:28:59.438
Ask my bollocks.

559
00:28:59.438 --> 00:29:01.607
Who was that ringing you?

560
00:29:01.607 --> 00:29:03.475
Is that one of your
dirty little tramps?

561
00:29:03.475 --> 00:29:04.877
You ever shut the fuck up?

562
00:29:04.877 --> 00:29:07.914
I know you. Val Fagan.
and I'm telling you now.

563
00:29:07.914 --> 00:29:09.181
if you arrive home here

564
00:29:09.181 --> 00:29:10.582
with something like
fucking spotty dick

565
00:29:10.582 --> 00:29:13.052
I won't be going anywhere
fucking near you.

566
00:29:13.052 --> 00:29:15.321
I hope it fucking
falls off you. so I do.

567
00:29:15.321 --> 00:29:16.755
Will you ever give it a rest?

568
00:29:16.755 --> 00:29:18.290
- How are you. Val?
- Alright. Wellsy?

569
00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:21.027
Yeah. I have a
proposal for you. yeah?

570
00:29:21.027 --> 00:29:23.562
Ever heard of a bloke
called Decco Cunningham?

571
00:29:26.165 --> 00:29:27.399
Wellsy
tells me he got word

572
00:29:27.399 --> 00:29:29.001
that Decco Cunningham
wants to meet me

573
00:29:29.001 --> 00:29:30.870
to buy in some of our
next drug shipment

574
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:32.671
from the proceeds
of his tiger job.

575
00:29:37.043 --> 00:29:38.845
With the cops after
seizing the TVs

576
00:29:38.845 --> 00:29:40.712
and a drought on shipments.

577
00:29:40.712 --> 00:29:42.815
I'm thinking a few quid
from Decco wouldn't harm

578
00:29:42.815 --> 00:29:44.450
in helping towards
the Corrigans' payment

579
00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:45.551
for the next shipment.

580
00:29:46.785 --> 00:29:49.355
I'm happy to see what
Decco has to offer.

581
00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:53.525
But the Old Bill
came for Decco first.

582
00:29:53.525 --> 00:29:55.094
What the fuck is this?

583
00:29:57.429 --> 00:29:58.664
The
story is that cops

584
00:29:58.664 --> 00:30:00.766
had got DNA for Kezza.
one of Decco's crew.

585
00:30:00.766 --> 00:30:03.702
from the cardboard box he
used to keep the wife in.

586
00:30:03.702 --> 00:30:05.704
Right. down. get down!

587
00:30:08.875 --> 00:30:10.542
Ah. Jesus Christ! Fuck!

588
00:30:10.542 --> 00:30:13.112
Now you're
getting slapped.

589
00:30:13.112 --> 00:30:14.813
Get off me!

590
00:30:14.813 --> 00:30:16.048
They have
fuck all on Decco

591
00:30:16.048 --> 00:30:17.316
but he gets it into
his fucked up head

592
00:30:17.316 --> 00:30:19.285
that I stitched him up
with the cops somehow.

593
00:30:19.285 --> 00:30:22.354
Fagan. you rat bastard!

594
00:30:22.354 --> 00:30:23.990
Get the fuck outta here.

595
00:30:27.826 --> 00:30:29.228
Stay down.

596
00:30:29.228 --> 00:30:32.932
Shut the hell up!

597
00:30:32.932 --> 00:30:37.803
Fucking. you cunts.
fuck off!

598
00:30:37.803 --> 00:30:40.806
I'll kill you all.
I'll kill you!

599
00:30:40.806 --> 00:30:42.574
Decco's time in
the Old Bill's custody

600
00:30:42.574 --> 00:30:43.842
isn't quiet in any way.

601
00:30:44.843 --> 00:30:46.879
He's like a caged animal.

602
00:30:49.415 --> 00:30:50.749
Search him.

603
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:53.152
He's good.

604
00:30:53.152 --> 00:30:55.321
Yeah. Get out. get out.

605
00:30:56.288 --> 00:30:57.156
Go. go. go.

606
00:30:59.191 --> 00:31:00.226
Fucking-

607
00:31:01.493 --> 00:31:04.796
Come on! Come on.
you fucking prick!

608
00:31:07.233 --> 00:31:10.036
I'll show you cunts. you prick!

609
00:31:10.036 --> 00:31:11.670
I'll find your home some night

610
00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:14.573
and I'll rape your wife!

611
00:31:14.573 --> 00:31:17.709
Oh. I'll fucking
show you alright!

612
00:31:17.709 --> 00:31:18.945
Cops didn't have enough

613
00:31:18.945 --> 00:31:20.146
to charge Decco
with the tiger job

614
00:31:20.146 --> 00:31:22.281
so all he gets is a few
Mickey Mouse charges

615
00:31:22.281 --> 00:31:24.350
like breach of the
peace and public order.

616
00:31:26.685 --> 00:31:28.087
But I know it's only
a matter of time

617
00:31:28.087 --> 00:31:30.356
before I cross paths
with Decco again.

618
00:31:35.261 --> 00:31:36.528
Two secure holding areas.

619
00:31:36.528 --> 00:31:37.930
The first one is along here.

620
00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:39.398
I can get you out of
there from the main-

621
00:31:39.398 --> 00:31:41.633
Eventually the time
comes where Renno makes contact

622
00:31:41.633 --> 00:31:43.469
to enlighten me with
his master plan.

623
00:31:44.903 --> 00:31:45.904
And it's beautiful.

624
00:31:47.173 --> 00:31:48.374
But he can only
access from there

625
00:31:48.374 --> 00:31:50.142
from the main floor inside.

626
00:31:50.142 --> 00:31:51.410
It's a big job

627
00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:53.112
so we need extra pairs
of hands to help us out.

628
00:31:58.517 --> 00:32:00.052
You make sure
you's weren't followed?

629
00:32:00.052 --> 00:32:01.920
Yeah. all good. Took the
back roads and all. eh?

630
00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:03.689
Left the cars out
on the main road.

631
00:32:05.924 --> 00:32:07.493
These the lads you
were telling me about?

632
00:32:07.493 --> 00:32:10.129
Ross and Eric.
they're from the flats.

633
00:32:10.129 --> 00:32:12.498
Straight up. yeah.
My nanny's block.

634
00:32:13.865 --> 00:32:14.900
Know who I am?

635
00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:15.734
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

636
00:32:18.104 --> 00:32:20.039
Tell anyone you were
coming here tonight?

637
00:32:20.039 --> 00:32:21.173
- No.
- No.

638
00:32:22.741 --> 00:32:24.043
Do as you're told.
keep your mouth shut.

639
00:32:24.043 --> 00:32:26.112
there's a nice few
quid in this for you's.

640
00:32:26.112 --> 00:32:28.747
Make sure Wellsy gives
you plenty more work.

641
00:32:28.747 --> 00:32:30.216
But if you's open
your fucking mouth

642
00:32:30.216 --> 00:32:32.018
about what's happening
here tonight.

643
00:32:32.951 --> 00:32:34.153
I'll fucking kill you's.

644
00:32:35.587 --> 00:32:36.422
Alright?

645
00:32:38.324 --> 00:32:41.027
Right. lads. phones
out. turned off.

646
00:32:41.027 --> 00:32:42.894
Put them in the box there
beside the table. yeah?

647
00:32:42.894 --> 00:32:44.096
Get them back after
the job is done.

648
00:32:44.096 --> 00:32:45.297
Myself
and Renno then give

649
00:32:45.297 --> 00:32:47.399
the rest of the crew
the rundown on the job.

650
00:32:47.399 --> 00:32:48.934
Somebody's gonna
be distributing cash

651
00:32:48.934 --> 00:32:51.103
all over the city's ATMs for
the bank holiday weekend.

652
00:32:52.071 --> 00:32:53.505
Yeah. that's all well and good

653
00:32:53.505 --> 00:32:55.874
but how the fuck are we
supposed to get into the place?

654
00:33:07.786 --> 00:33:09.855
Jesus. lads.

655
00:33:09.855 --> 00:33:12.991
Where the fuck did
you stroke this from?

656
00:33:12.991 --> 00:33:16.262
It's not stolen.
Renno built it.

657
00:33:18.564 --> 00:33:21.467
Fuck! Fair play. Renno.

658
00:33:22.601 --> 00:33:24.270
I hope you's all
haven't made any plans

659
00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:26.004
for the next day or so. eh?

660
00:33:30.242 --> 00:33:31.577
We hit it in the morning.

661
00:33:53.699 --> 00:33:54.933
There we go.

662
00:33:54.933 --> 00:33:57.236
Thanks. Mike. Fancy
going for a drink?

663
00:33:57.236 --> 00:33:59.505
Anything I need to
know before I can stop?

664
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:13.051
I don't know. but I
have to work for the 3rd?

665
00:34:13.051 --> 00:34:14.320
- Yeah. You have to.
- I'll have that

666
00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.421
on your desk in
about half an hour.

667
00:34:15.421 --> 00:34:16.822
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

668
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:20.559
How's your gran?

669
00:34:23.929 --> 00:34:27.933
Jane Cleary. Got a
message for you here. Jane.

670
00:34:32.871 --> 00:34:34.773
My associate has your kids now.

671
00:34:35.641 --> 00:34:36.908
If you don't open this door.

672
00:34:36.908 --> 00:34:39.245
if you hit the panic
or distress alarms.

673
00:34:39.245 --> 00:34:41.180
he will throw acid
in your kids' faces.

674
00:34:42.548 --> 00:34:44.616
Now. open the fucking door!

675
00:34:47.119 --> 00:34:48.154
Good girl. Jane.

676
00:34:48.154 --> 00:34:49.255
You. Eric?

677
00:34:49.255 --> 00:34:50.088
Steve.

678
00:34:52.658 --> 00:34:54.993
Right. face down
on the deck. now.

679
00:35:01.133 --> 00:35:02.201
All set here.

680
00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:15.814
Here we go. couple of minutes.

681
00:35:37.203 --> 00:35:38.537
Right. we're in.

682
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:46.478
Lads. get ready. ballies on.

683
00:35:54.253 --> 00:35:56.054
There's a delay with
that consignment. Davy.

684
00:35:56.054 --> 00:35:58.590
so I wouldn't worry about
it 'til later on. anyway.

685
00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:01.026
Have we got one
back already. Davy?

686
00:36:01.026 --> 00:36:02.794
I'm not sure.

687
00:36:02.794 --> 00:36:04.630
I can double check with
control if you want?

688
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:06.097
Yeah. have a look and
see what the craic is. man.

689
00:36:06.097 --> 00:36:07.333
Yeah.

690
00:36:07.333 --> 00:36:10.101
Hub 4 to Control.
there's an empty 168

691
00:36:10.101 --> 00:36:11.203
back for its next pickup.

692
00:36:11.203 --> 00:36:14.540
Right. You. up. now.

693
00:36:15.541 --> 00:36:16.775
Go on. quickly.

694
00:36:21.112 --> 00:36:23.215
Want to see these
two again. yeah?

695
00:36:23.215 --> 00:36:24.716
Go on then.

696
00:36:24.716 --> 00:36:27.486
Give the command to let the
van in the gates. Understand?

697
00:36:29.588 --> 00:36:32.258
Roger. Hub 4. You
can let them in.

698
00:36:59.385 --> 00:37:00.819
- Fucking stay there!
- Hands where I can see them.

699
00:37:00.819 --> 00:37:03.054
that's it. good boy. good boy.

700
00:37:06.425 --> 00:37:08.527
Get on the fucking
wall. Get the fuck down!

701
00:37:08.527 --> 00:37:09.828
Now. now!

702
00:37:13.832 --> 00:37:15.033
Up against the wall!

703
00:37:15.033 --> 00:37:15.834
- Go on. do it!
- Check the offices.

704
00:37:15.834 --> 00:37:18.036
check the offices!

705
00:37:18.036 --> 00:37:19.638
Eyes against the fucking wall!

706
00:37:23.442 --> 00:37:24.610
Get your fucking
hands in the air!

707
00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:25.844
You. get up. let's go.

708
00:37:25.844 --> 00:37:27.279
before I smash your
bleeding teeth in!

709
00:37:27.279 --> 00:37:29.381
Come on. Move it. move it.

710
00:37:29.381 --> 00:37:30.215
Come on!

711
00:37:31.917 --> 00:37:33.852
Make sure they're on tight.

712
00:37:33.852 --> 00:37:35.354
Tight as you can.

713
00:37:37.122 --> 00:37:40.959
Get down! Get fucking
down. give me your hands!

714
00:37:40.959 --> 00:37:42.260
- Stay there!
- Stay up

715
00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:43.562
against that fucking wall.

716
00:37:43.562 --> 00:37:45.030
Turn around
before I clatter you.

717
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:47.833
Fucking move now.
you little tossers. No looking.

718
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.837
Who's the manager?
Are you in charge?

719
00:37:51.837 --> 00:37:54.806
I said. which one of
you is the fucking man-

720
00:37:54.806 --> 00:37:55.974
Me.

721
00:37:55.974 --> 00:37:58.844
Up. Look at me.

722
00:37:58.844 --> 00:38:01.279
You have the keys and the
codes to the cash office. yes?

723
00:38:01.279 --> 00:38:03.415
We're gonna go down and
you're gonna open that.

724
00:38:03.415 --> 00:38:06.318
One wrong move and I will put
a bullet in your fucking head.

725
00:38:06.318 --> 00:38:08.086
- Hey!
- Hey!

726
00:38:11.957 --> 00:38:13.459
Eyes on
the fucking wall!

727
00:38:13.459 --> 00:38:15.361
You wanna switch on. you
dozy fucking freak. alright?

728
00:38:15.361 --> 00:38:17.028
Bring have-a
go-hero over here.

729
00:38:20.031 --> 00:38:21.066
Get that out the van.

730
00:38:22.768 --> 00:38:24.636
It seems like one of your
staff fancied themselves

731
00:38:24.636 --> 00:38:25.604
as a bit of a hero.

732
00:38:27.072 --> 00:38:29.508
So just to prove my point
that we don't fuck around.

733
00:38:30.576 --> 00:38:32.878
No. please. please. No!

734
00:38:32.878 --> 00:38:35.313
Don't fucking look.
don't fucking look!

735
00:38:35.313 --> 00:38:36.548
Now. unless you want

736
00:38:36.548 --> 00:38:39.084
his burnt remains
on your conscience.

737
00:38:39.084 --> 00:38:41.152
you'll do exactly as I say!

738
00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:41.987
Now. move!

739
00:38:42.888 --> 00:38:44.189
You're with me.

740
00:38:56.968 --> 00:38:59.037
Why are they all
in 100 euro notes?

741
00:38:59.037 --> 00:39:01.072
The banks want them in large
denominations for the ATMs

742
00:39:01.072 --> 00:39:02.741
so the customers
will spend more.

743
00:39:04.743 --> 00:39:06.778
Robbing bastards.

744
00:39:06.778 --> 00:39:08.380
All those bankers should
be fucking locked up.

745
00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:09.415
so they should.

746
00:39:10.549 --> 00:39:11.383
Open it.

747
00:39:23.995 --> 00:39:24.830
Move.

748
00:39:32.571 --> 00:39:33.405
Stay here.

749
00:39:34.573 --> 00:39:35.407
Go.

750
00:39:39.911 --> 00:39:42.113
Right. Let's get to work.

751
00:39:55.494 --> 00:39:57.228
That's all of it.

752
00:39:57.228 --> 00:39:58.163
Let's go.

753
00:40:11.409 --> 00:40:12.811
We're outta here.

754
00:40:31.262 --> 00:40:33.732
Like
candy from a fucking baby.

755
00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.075
That was fucking great!

756
00:40:44.075 --> 00:40:46.344
I'm fucking pumped here. I am.

757
00:40:46.344 --> 00:40:47.412
Carrot!

758
00:40:47.412 --> 00:40:48.647
What?

759
00:40:48.647 --> 00:40:49.581
I've been thinking
about something. right?

760
00:40:49.581 --> 00:40:51.182
It's about those TVs.

761
00:40:52.484 --> 00:40:53.919
Bazza Hogg knew about the TVs.

762
00:40:53.919 --> 00:40:55.654
he didn't know about the lockup.

763
00:40:55.654 --> 00:40:58.490
How did the cops find
out about the lockup?

764
00:40:58.490 --> 00:41:00.091
Did they see you
hanging around it?

765
00:41:00.091 --> 00:41:00.859
No chance. Val.

766
00:41:02.027 --> 00:41:02.961
You're saying
you took those TVs

767
00:41:02.961 --> 00:41:05.030
to yourself. Carrot. what?

768
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:07.799
Nah. Carrot wouldn't anything
like that. sure he wouldn't.

769
00:41:09.568 --> 00:41:11.336
We'll have a proper chat
about it later. yeah?

770
00:41:11.336 --> 00:41:12.270
Sure thing. Val.

771
00:41:14.005 --> 00:41:15.440
This'll do us here.

772
00:41:21.647 --> 00:41:22.914
- Ross.
- Yeah?

773
00:41:22.914 --> 00:41:25.183
Jump down. give Wellsy
a hand with them tools.

774
00:41:33.424 --> 00:41:34.726
Sorry. young thing.

775
00:41:35.794 --> 00:41:37.295
I just don't trust you's.

776
00:41:49.174 --> 00:41:50.742
Held
staff at gunpoint

777
00:41:50.742 --> 00:41:53.545
before stealing a
large quantity of cash.

778
00:41:53.545 --> 00:41:55.947
Sources say the
raid was carried out

779
00:41:55.947 --> 00:42:00.085
with military precision and
the haul taken during the raid

780
00:42:00.085 --> 00:42:01.452
is believed to be in the region

781
00:42:01.452 --> 00:42:03.855
of 5.5 million euros.

782
00:42:03.855 --> 00:42:05.290
Hello?

783
00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:05.957
I need fucking
witness protection.

784
00:42:05.957 --> 00:42:06.758
do you hear me?

785
00:42:06.758 --> 00:42:08.159
Carrot. Where are you?

786
00:42:08.159 --> 00:42:09.127
We were supposed to be
meeting an hour ago.

787
00:42:09.127 --> 00:42:10.361
He's fucking onto me.

788
00:42:10.361 --> 00:42:12.030
He knows about the
fucking televisions

789
00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:13.531
and he's gonna have
me fucking clipped.

790
00:42:13.531 --> 00:42:14.966
Do you hear me?

791
00:42:14.966 --> 00:42:16.868
Listen. calm down.
alright? What's going on?

792
00:42:16.868 --> 00:42:18.336
Are you listening to me?

793
00:42:18.336 --> 00:42:20.639
He's fucking onto me.
that's what's fucking up!

794
00:42:20.639 --> 00:42:21.873
Where are you now?

795
00:42:21.873 --> 00:42:23.575
Just around the corner
from my fucking gaff.

796
00:42:23.575 --> 00:42:25.210
Okay. Stay on the line.

797
00:42:27.445 --> 00:42:29.014
Cigire? It's Carrot.

798
00:42:29.014 --> 00:42:30.716
He's rattled. he
wants to come in.

799
00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:37.789
Dennis. It's Liz Delahunt.

800
00:42:37.789 --> 00:42:39.257
What's the story?

801
00:42:39.257 --> 00:42:41.326
He's fucking
onto me. yeah? I know he is.

802
00:42:41.326 --> 00:42:43.094
Whatever you's want. statements.

803
00:42:43.094 --> 00:42:44.362
the money from today's stroke.

804
00:42:44.362 --> 00:42:45.563
I can get it for you's. yeah?

805
00:42:45.563 --> 00:42:48.333
The money from today's
cash depot robbery?

806
00:42:48.333 --> 00:42:50.135
Fucking Renno planned the lot.

807
00:42:50.135 --> 00:42:51.837
fucking us and
Val pulled it off.

808
00:42:51.837 --> 00:42:54.072
I just seen him blow
the fucking head

809
00:42:54.072 --> 00:42:55.707
off some young blonded job

810
00:42:55.707 --> 00:42:58.443
'cause he didn't fucking
trust him. do you hear me?

811
00:42:58.443 --> 00:43:00.211
Look. I need you's
to help here. yeah?

812
00:43:00.211 --> 00:43:02.848
Just fucking bring me in. right?

813
00:43:02.848 --> 00:43:05.383
Get me all sorted with
witness fucking protection.

814
00:43:05.383 --> 00:43:08.654
Okay. Dennis. you just
go in home. right now

815
00:43:08.654 --> 00:43:10.822
and we will be there as
soon as we can. okay?

816
00:43:10.822 --> 00:43:12.257
Yeah. Yeah.

817
00:43:13.659 --> 00:43:16.461
Okay. take Aisling and
get around there. right now.

818
00:43:16.461 --> 00:43:17.963
- Yeah.
- Go.

819
00:43:17.963 --> 00:43:19.965
It's hard to believe
that Delahunt has us all.

820
00:43:21.032 --> 00:43:22.267
With Carrot's evidence

821
00:43:22.267 --> 00:43:24.135
I'm looking at the rest
of my life locked up.

822
00:43:25.303 --> 00:43:27.105
But sometimes divine
intervention comes

823
00:43:27.105 --> 00:43:28.339
in the strangest of ways.

824
00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:33.378
Decco Cunningham.

825
00:43:33.378 --> 00:43:35.580
No! No. no. no!

826
00:43:49.828 --> 00:43:51.797
And he definitely
said he'd meet us here?

827
00:43:52.964 --> 00:43:54.199
And his phone is off?

828
00:43:54.199 --> 00:43:55.834
Yeah. I'm just
getting voicemail.

829
00:43:55.834 --> 00:43:57.836
I've a feeling something
bad's about to happen.

830
00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:03.208
You know that shit of yours.

831
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:06.678
After being
lifted for the tiger job.

832
00:44:06.678 --> 00:44:08.413
Decco has the daggers
out for us all.

833
00:44:08.413 --> 00:44:10.181
Yeah. you! Yeah!

834
00:44:14.085 --> 00:44:15.286
He starts with Carrot

835
00:44:15.286 --> 00:44:16.822
and has plans to work
his way up to me.

836
00:44:20.658 --> 00:44:21.793
You'd better be back

837
00:44:21.793 --> 00:44:24.229
with that creepy
looking fucker. alright?

838
00:44:25.964 --> 00:44:27.398
Cut him down. Arthur.

839
00:44:33.939 --> 00:44:35.106
I don't
even want to begin

840
00:44:35.106 --> 00:44:37.175
to describe what Carrot
is going through.

841
00:44:38.376 --> 00:44:41.412
Firstly to be beaten
to a pulp. and then.

842
00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:44.950
Over there.
and get his kecks down.

843
00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:47.753
Val Fagan's little
bitches. all you were.

844
00:44:48.653 --> 00:44:50.321
Now you're my bitch.

845
00:44:51.556 --> 00:44:53.024
Let's just
say that Decco

846
00:44:53.024 --> 00:44:55.060
wants to have his enjoyment
and his way with Carrot.

847
00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:57.595
How some can afflict
such sadistic brutality

848
00:44:57.595 --> 00:44:58.830
on another is beyond me.

849
00:45:00.732 --> 00:45:02.167
Come here. Come here.

850
00:45:02.167 --> 00:45:03.368
And you might
think that Decco

851
00:45:03.368 --> 00:45:05.103
just spared me a
long stretch inside.

852
00:45:08.039 --> 00:45:09.574
But all I know is that
he just declared war.

853
00:45:16.181 --> 00:45:17.749
As for the robbery.
the cops have to look

854
00:45:17.749 --> 00:45:19.617
like they're doing
something about it.

855
00:45:22.187 --> 00:45:24.322
So the knock on the
door is inevitable.

856
00:45:24.322 --> 00:45:25.791
Armed Gardai!

857
00:45:27.592 --> 00:45:29.060
Don't move. face down!

858
00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:31.229
They come
into our gaffs.

859
00:45:31.229 --> 00:45:33.398
Armed Gardai. armed
Gardai. get your hands up!

860
00:45:33.398 --> 00:45:35.300
Keep your hands up!
Don't move!

861
00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:37.002
Turn them upside down.

862
00:45:41.639 --> 00:45:43.174
Get your fucking hands off!

863
00:45:43.174 --> 00:45:45.676
Don't touch me. I'm telling
you now. don't fucking-

864
00:45:45.676 --> 00:45:47.612
Then haul us
off for questioning.

865
00:45:50.849 --> 00:45:53.451
They section us with the
usual 24 hours of bullshit.

866
00:45:56.421 --> 00:45:57.622
And we sit in silence.

867
00:46:01.726 --> 00:46:04.896
We know the Gardai don't have
a scratch of evidence on us.

868
00:46:04.896 --> 00:46:08.934
I'll ask you the
same question. Mr. Fagan.

869
00:46:08.934 --> 00:46:11.369
They're just
going through the motions.

870
00:46:14.772 --> 00:46:15.606
And so are we.

871
00:46:25.450 --> 00:46:27.452
Once the dust settles
I'm on cloud nine.

872
00:46:29.387 --> 00:46:32.357
5.5 million richer
and I'm very happy.

873
00:46:34.159 --> 00:46:34.993
Untouchable.

874
00:46:36.761 --> 00:46:38.329
And it feels fucking great.

875
00:46:47.338 --> 00:46:48.373
Ah. what do you want?

876
00:46:48.373 --> 00:46:49.440
Mind if I sit down?

877
00:46:51.309 --> 00:46:53.344
Have you not got nothing
better to be doing?

878
00:46:55.446 --> 00:46:57.582
You searched my gaff
and you questioned me.

879
00:46:59.918 --> 00:47:03.088
You can fuck off if you think
I'm buying you a coffee.

880
00:47:03.088 --> 00:47:04.522
I've no cash on me.

881
00:47:05.823 --> 00:47:08.593
Let me introduce
Detective Goff

882
00:47:09.694 --> 00:47:11.729
from the Criminal Assets Bureau.

883
00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:15.166
Valentino Fagan.
consider yourself served

884
00:47:16.334 --> 00:47:18.803
with a tax bill for
1.2 million euros

885
00:47:18.803 --> 00:47:21.606
in unpaid revenue fees made
for the past six years.

886
00:47:21.606 --> 00:47:23.909
I suggest you have your
solicitors contact us.

887
00:47:28.546 --> 00:47:29.414
Unpaid tax?

888
00:47:29.414 --> 00:47:30.248
Hm.

889
00:47:31.382 --> 00:47:32.850
You know what I think
of that. don't you?

890
00:47:34.852 --> 00:47:35.686
Bullshit.

891
00:47:38.323 --> 00:47:40.725
Do you know what I'll do
to keep you's all happy?

892
00:47:41.893 --> 00:47:44.229
Being the upstanding
citizen that I am.

893
00:47:45.363 --> 00:47:47.132
I'll pay the tax
man back a few quid.

894
00:47:48.433 --> 00:47:49.667
But 1.2 million?

895
00:47:50.936 --> 00:47:52.470
You can fuck off.

896
00:47:55.506 --> 00:47:56.307
Hm.

897
00:47:58.543 --> 00:48:01.379
That is very gracious.

898
00:48:01.379 --> 00:48:04.382
But then again I don't
suppose it puts much of a dent

899
00:48:04.382 --> 00:48:07.152
in five and a half million.

900
00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:11.289
As I told you yesterday.

901
00:48:11.289 --> 00:48:13.058
I wouldn't know
anything about that.

902
00:48:15.126 --> 00:48:17.662
It was some stroke
though. wasn't it?

903
00:48:17.662 --> 00:48:19.430
I mean. if the man who
pulled off that job

904
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:22.667
walked in here now. I'd
have to congratulate him

905
00:48:22.667 --> 00:48:23.601
and buy him a pint.

906
00:48:25.403 --> 00:48:28.506
You think you're a
really big man. don't you?

907
00:48:28.506 --> 00:48:31.542
You don't give a
fuck about anyone.

908
00:48:33.644 --> 00:48:38.083
Do you seriously think that the
reign of the great Val Fagan

909
00:48:38.083 --> 00:48:39.484
is going to last forever?

910
00:48:39.484 --> 00:48:41.219
'Cause let me tell
you something.

911
00:48:41.219 --> 00:48:43.654
it's only a matter of time

912
00:48:43.654 --> 00:48:46.992
before someone smarter
and more dangerous

913
00:48:46.992 --> 00:48:49.827
comes and takes you out.

914
00:48:55.233 --> 00:48:57.735
Cheerio now. Elizabeth.
you have a lovely day.

915
00:49:03.441 --> 00:49:05.176
Poor Liz.

916
00:49:09.347 --> 00:49:12.450
I often wonder what kind of
life she has away from her work.

917
00:49:13.884 --> 00:49:15.653
But being so driven and
committed to catching me.

918
00:49:15.653 --> 00:49:16.487
how could she?

919
00:49:24.595 --> 00:49:26.031
And what's eating her now is

920
00:49:26.031 --> 00:49:27.865
she was a split hair
away from taking me down.

921
00:49:31.869 --> 00:49:33.271
Carrot was her trump card.

922
00:49:34.939 --> 00:49:37.042
And it didn't play
thanks to Decco.

923
00:49:41.846 --> 00:49:44.349
And when I'm told about
Carrot's sickening demise.

924
00:49:46.051 --> 00:49:48.819
well let's just say
the gloves are off.

925
00:49:48.819 --> 00:49:50.755
That foreskin-faced prick.

926
00:49:50.755 --> 00:49:53.124
Word is Decco thinks you
set him up with the Old Bill

927
00:49:53.124 --> 00:49:54.825
after he pulled the tiger job.

928
00:49:54.825 --> 00:49:56.894
I don't give a
fuck what he thinks.

929
00:49:56.894 --> 00:49:58.329
That stupid cunt has a pop at us

930
00:49:58.329 --> 00:50:00.465
and he thinks we're
gonna take it lying down?

931
00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:04.169
Tool up and do what
needs to be done.

932
00:50:05.770 --> 00:50:06.904
If he wants a war.

933
00:50:08.639 --> 00:50:10.141
we'll fucking bring it to him.

934
00:50:54.985 --> 00:50:56.987
Out of Decco's crew we've
two of them taken care of

935
00:50:56.987 --> 00:50:57.955
in a matter of days.

936
00:50:59.557 --> 00:51:03.060
With one of them locked up
on remand over the tiger job.

937
00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:04.529
All that leaves is Decco.

938
00:51:07.732 --> 00:51:10.168
I know. Ma.

939
00:51:10.168 --> 00:51:12.437
No. he didn't mean to slap me.

940
00:51:14.071 --> 00:51:18.443
I'll talk
to them all tomorrow. alright?

941
00:51:28.453 --> 00:51:29.487
Alright now!

942
00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:32.257
Decco Cunningham. where is he?

943
00:51:32.257 --> 00:51:33.758
What? Who are you?

944
00:51:33.758 --> 00:51:34.992
Tell me where he is

945
00:51:34.992 --> 00:51:36.594
or I'll put a fucking
bullet in your head!

946
00:51:36.594 --> 00:51:38.095
Which flat is Cunningham's?

947
00:51:38.095 --> 00:51:40.731
Number 23. first floor.
It's his girlfriend's house.

948
00:51:42.167 --> 00:51:45.803
I fucking hate serving
these gym forms on gowzers.

949
00:51:45.803 --> 00:51:47.104
We're doing our thing
by informing them

950
00:51:47.104 --> 00:51:48.406
of a threat on their lives

951
00:51:48.406 --> 00:51:50.675
and they normally slam
the door in our face.

952
00:51:51.976 --> 00:51:53.278
You coming?

953
00:51:53.278 --> 00:51:54.512
I'll follow you up.

954
00:51:54.512 --> 00:51:55.280
I'm gonna run a check
on that car there.

955
00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:56.414
Fair enough.

956
00:52:01.386 --> 00:52:03.221
Oh. fuck!

957
00:52:03.221 --> 00:52:04.889
I haven't seen him!

958
00:52:04.889 --> 00:52:05.756
Don't lie to me.

959
00:52:05.756 --> 00:52:07.292
I'm not. I swear!

960
00:52:07.292 --> 00:52:10.261
Last time he was here
was two days ago.

961
00:52:10.261 --> 00:52:11.529
He's not fucking here.

962
00:52:13.564 --> 00:52:16.701
You tell that prick
he's a fucking dead man!

963
00:52:28.145 --> 00:52:29.079
Oh. fuck!

964
00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:34.819
Gardai. stop!

965
00:52:34.819 --> 00:52:35.653
Ah. fuck!

966
00:52:46.897 --> 00:52:48.032
Where did he go?

967
00:52:48.032 --> 00:52:48.866
Out there.

968
00:52:55.206 --> 00:52:56.674
With the Old
Bill on high alert

969
00:52:56.674 --> 00:52:59.477
after we clipped the
other two of Decco's crew.

970
00:52:59.477 --> 00:53:01.312
I'm not surprised
about the close call.

971
00:53:02.713 --> 00:53:04.982
But it's too close for Wellsy.

972
00:53:04.982 --> 00:53:06.584
Although he's smart
enough to dump anything

973
00:53:06.584 --> 00:53:08.586
that can link him to
what just happened.

974
00:53:13.791 --> 00:53:15.960
Stop the car. It's Mark Wells.

975
00:53:24.469 --> 00:53:25.570
So the cops grab Wellsy

976
00:53:25.570 --> 00:53:27.137
and pull him in for questioning.

977
00:53:28.673 --> 00:53:30.375
They give him a
proper going over.

978
00:53:31.542 --> 00:53:35.112
Taking photographs.
fingerprints. DNA.

979
00:53:36.013 --> 00:53:37.382
And they seize his clobber.

980
00:53:39.083 --> 00:53:40.485
Between the movers
and the shakers.

981
00:53:40.485 --> 00:53:42.152
we're able to get rid
of the gun and the bally

982
00:53:42.152 --> 00:53:44.622
that Wellsy dumped before
the cops could find them.

983
00:53:45.823 --> 00:53:47.292
But with the gun residue on him.

984
00:53:47.292 --> 00:53:49.026
the cops have enough
to charge him.

985
00:53:50.528 --> 00:53:51.962
And with a firearms charge.

986
00:53:51.962 --> 00:53:54.332
Wellsy knows that he's
looking at a stint in custody.

987
00:54:01.171 --> 00:54:02.340
Tom.

988
00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:04.809
Amazing work on
getting Mark Wells. Liz.

989
00:54:04.809 --> 00:54:06.176
But this doesn't read well.

990
00:54:07.412 --> 00:54:09.614
As of now. you've
got unlimited budget

991
00:54:09.614 --> 00:54:11.081
to go after Fagan himself.

992
00:54:12.149 --> 00:54:13.384
Do whatever it takes.

993
00:54:20.791 --> 00:54:22.293
I've a few things to do today

994
00:54:22.293 --> 00:54:23.694
so I'm just gonna drop you at
your nanny's first. alright?

995
00:54:23.694 --> 00:54:24.529
Okay.

996
00:54:26.263 --> 00:54:28.098
Make sure you put
your seatbelt on.

997
00:54:34.972 --> 00:54:35.906
What?

998
00:54:35.906 --> 00:54:37.174
Good afternoon. Mr. Fagan.

999
00:54:37.174 --> 00:54:38.709
We just wanna see
how you are today.

1000
00:54:38.709 --> 00:54:39.910
What?

1001
00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:41.045
We just wanna be
sure that you're okay

1002
00:54:41.045 --> 00:54:42.547
and that no harm comes to you.

1003
00:54:43.681 --> 00:54:45.182
Whatever. you
bleeding dope. you.

1004
00:54:48.052 --> 00:54:50.054
So. you wanna get a tattoo?

1005
00:54:50.054 --> 00:54:52.222
Yeah. like the
one on your neck.

1006
00:54:52.222 --> 00:54:54.659
You wanna get a tattoo
of the Grim Reaper?

1007
00:54:54.659 --> 00:54:56.126
What's the Grim Reaper?

1008
00:54:56.126 --> 00:54:57.962
The Grim Reaper is a
ghost that appears to you

1009
00:54:57.962 --> 00:55:00.230
just before you're about to die.

1010
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:01.466
Well. do you want to know

1011
00:55:01.466 --> 00:55:03.534
what I want to be
when I'm older?

1012
00:55:03.534 --> 00:55:05.102
A detective.

1013
00:55:05.102 --> 00:55:06.604
A fucking Garda?

1014
00:55:08.906 --> 00:55:11.742
You're
just winding your old man up.

1015
00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:14.111
Fuck's sake.

1016
00:55:20.918 --> 00:55:21.919
Fuck's sake.

1017
00:55:24.254 --> 00:55:26.056
Bloody scumbag bastards.

1018
00:55:35.766 --> 00:55:37.968
What the fuck are you's at?

1019
00:55:37.968 --> 00:55:39.637
This is fucking
harassment. this is.

1020
00:55:39.637 --> 00:55:40.838
No need to be alarmed. sir.

1021
00:55:40.838 --> 00:55:42.306
We're just concerned
for your safety.

1022
00:55:42.306 --> 00:55:43.941
With you being such
an upstanding citizen.

1023
00:55:43.941 --> 00:55:45.443
we're obliged to provide you

1024
00:55:45.443 --> 00:55:48.245
with all the protection and
safety within our power. 24/7.

1025
00:55:48.245 --> 00:55:50.280
Is this what Delahunt
is at now. is it?

1026
00:55:51.682 --> 00:55:54.251
I tell you's. you's are some
shower of fucking cunts.

1027
00:55:54.251 --> 00:55:55.653
Please watch
your language. sir.

1028
00:55:55.653 --> 00:55:57.221
It's an offense to use
threatening. abusive.

1029
00:55:57.221 --> 00:55:58.823
or insulting language
in a public place.

1030
00:55:58.823 --> 00:55:59.857
Fuck off.

1031
00:56:06.296 --> 00:56:08.232
They're following
me everywhere I go.

1032
00:56:08.232 --> 00:56:11.068
They're behind me
everywhere I go!

1033
00:56:12.970 --> 00:56:16.140
It's harassment. It's
nothing short of harassment.

1034
00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:17.942
Look. Val. we'll
lodge a complaint with GSOC

1035
00:56:17.942 --> 00:56:19.777
and I'll write to the Chief
Superintendent about this.

1036
00:56:19.777 --> 00:56:21.145
We'll go through the
necessary channels.

1037
00:56:21.145 --> 00:56:24.081
The ne. fuck the
necessary channels. Violet!

1038
00:56:24.081 --> 00:56:25.349
Just get it sorted!

1039
00:56:38.228 --> 00:56:39.063
Alright?

1040
00:56:40.465 --> 00:56:42.099
Do you know there's a
bleeding unmarked cop car

1041
00:56:42.099 --> 00:56:43.333
sitting out there?

1042
00:56:43.333 --> 00:56:45.302
Course I know. you
bleeding bullet head!

1043
00:56:45.302 --> 00:56:47.938
Fucking pricks have been
following me around all day.

1044
00:56:51.442 --> 00:56:52.943
What's the story with that?

1045
00:56:52.943 --> 00:56:56.146
It's gonna be in a cast for
eight weeks. they're saying.

1046
00:56:56.146 --> 00:56:59.116
Had to put a fucking
pin in it and all.

1047
00:56:59.116 --> 00:57:01.118
Could be worse. couldn't it?

1048
00:57:01.118 --> 00:57:02.720
I might be laid up
for a little bit.

1049
00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:04.655
least I'm not banged
up like Wellsy was.

1050
00:57:05.523 --> 00:57:07.525
Shut the fuck up!

1051
00:57:07.525 --> 00:57:09.727
Cops could have this
place bugged or something.

1052
00:57:11.962 --> 00:57:14.832
Jesus. you're hitting the
sniff pretty hard there. Val.

1053
00:57:18.636 --> 00:57:20.605
Give it a fucking
rest. Cushty. will you?

1054
00:57:21.706 --> 00:57:23.107
You sound like my poxy wife.

1055
00:57:25.576 --> 00:57:27.211
And you needn't think I'm
paying your medical bills

1056
00:57:27.211 --> 00:57:28.045
for that. either!

1057
00:58:09.019 --> 00:58:10.621
Fucking pricks.

1058
00:58:10.621 --> 00:58:12.623
Are they still
hanging around outside?

1059
00:58:14.491 --> 00:58:15.726
Are you not in court today

1060
00:58:15.726 --> 00:58:17.461
for that Mickey Mouse
road traffic thing?

1061
00:58:19.797 --> 00:58:21.866
At least you'll have your
own personal Garda escort

1062
00:58:21.866 --> 00:58:23.100
to take you to the court.

1063
00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:24.802
Are you trying to
be fucking funny?

1064
00:58:28.706 --> 00:58:30.474
'Cause instead of
trying to be funny.

1065
00:58:30.474 --> 00:58:32.376
why don't you clean the gaff?

1066
00:58:32.376 --> 00:58:34.144
It's like a fucking tip.

1067
00:58:42.419 --> 00:58:45.022
Val. it's only two penalty
points and a 150 euro fine.

1068
00:58:45.022 --> 00:58:47.024
It should've been
fucking dismissed.

1069
00:58:47.024 --> 00:58:48.626
Useless. you are.

1070
00:58:48.626 --> 00:58:50.160
What the fuck do I
even pay you for?

1071
00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:52.162
You don't pay me. Val.
you're on free legal aid.

1072
00:58:52.162 --> 00:58:52.997
Good.

1073
00:58:55.532 --> 00:58:56.801
Bad day in court today. Val?

1074
00:58:56.801 --> 00:58:58.368
Fucking tan your hole
and get out of my face.

1075
00:58:58.368 --> 00:58:59.369
I'm not in the mood.

1076
00:59:00.905 --> 00:59:02.039
This
shite the cops are at

1077
00:59:02.039 --> 00:59:03.240
really has me on the edge

1078
00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:05.542
and I need to do
something about it.

1079
00:59:07.578 --> 00:59:08.979
How are you. Val?

1080
00:59:08.979 --> 00:59:09.914
Is he in?

1081
00:59:09.914 --> 00:59:11.448
Yeah. come on in.

1082
00:59:14.151 --> 00:59:15.185
You alright?

1083
00:59:15.185 --> 00:59:16.020
A word.

1084
00:59:28.498 --> 00:59:30.267
What's the story?

1085
00:59:30.267 --> 00:59:32.036
The story is I can't
take the bullshit

1086
00:59:32.036 --> 00:59:33.403
off these pricks anymore.

1087
00:59:33.403 --> 00:59:34.839
Who?

1088
00:59:34.839 --> 00:59:36.907
Delahunt and them fucking
dull birds down there.

1089
00:59:38.075 --> 00:59:40.210
They follow me
everywhere I go. 24/7.

1090
00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:41.712
I can't even take
a fucking shite

1091
00:59:41.712 --> 00:59:43.547
with that prick Hogan waving
at me through the window.

1092
00:59:43.547 --> 00:59:45.783
Sure. this will all die
down in a week or so. pal.

1093
00:59:45.783 --> 00:59:47.251
Don't fucking play
this down. Renno.

1094
00:59:47.251 --> 00:59:48.653
there's work to be done.

1095
00:59:48.653 --> 00:59:50.020
Corrigans' are coming
in in a day or two

1096
00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:51.288
to get their money
and I can't be seen

1097
00:59:51.288 --> 00:59:53.357
going around with them.
with them fucking pricks

1098
00:59:53.357 --> 00:59:54.892
up my hole every five minutes.

1099
00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:57.728
I want this sorted and
I want this sorted now.

1100
00:59:57.728 --> 00:59:58.929
What do you want done?

1101
01:00:02.667 --> 01:00:03.701
A car bomb.

1102
01:00:04.735 --> 01:00:06.303
For that bitch Delahunt.

1103
01:00:07.271 --> 01:00:08.505
You build it.

1104
01:00:08.505 --> 01:00:09.840
Or your mates from
the RA build it.

1105
01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:11.375
I don't really give a fuck

1106
01:00:11.375 --> 01:00:13.577
but I want her blown to fuck
by the middle of next week.

1107
01:00:15.012 --> 01:00:16.046
It'll send a message out
to the rest of the Guards.

1108
01:00:16.046 --> 01:00:17.281
they'll back the fuck off.

1109
01:00:17.281 --> 01:00:18.883
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

1110
01:00:18.883 --> 01:00:21.686
You're talking about
intentionally taking out a cop.

1111
01:00:22.552 --> 01:00:24.054
I don't give a fuck. Renno.

1112
01:00:24.054 --> 01:00:25.522
Blame it on the RA or something.

1113
01:00:25.522 --> 01:00:28.025
Look. man. I can
see you're wound up

1114
01:00:28.025 --> 01:00:31.261
about this whole situation
but if we kill a cop

1115
01:00:31.261 --> 01:00:32.863
we'll cause a serious shitstorm

1116
01:00:32.863 --> 01:00:34.464
that will last for years.

1117
01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:38.002
They'll be putting our
doors in every morning.

1118
01:00:38.002 --> 01:00:39.737
turning our lives upside down

1119
01:00:39.737 --> 01:00:42.072
'til they eventually get us.

1120
01:00:42.072 --> 01:00:43.774
And they will get us.

1121
01:00:43.774 --> 01:00:45.042
Val. look here.

1122
01:00:45.042 --> 01:00:47.644
Renno. this isn't
a fucking request.

1123
01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:49.113
I want it done.

1124
01:00:51.782 --> 01:00:53.718
Look. pal.

1125
01:00:53.718 --> 01:00:55.652
You need to think straight here.

1126
01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:56.921
you need to-

1127
01:00:56.921 --> 01:00:59.323
No. Renno. You need
to think straight here.

1128
01:00:59.323 --> 01:01:02.292
You need to think about what
I'm fucking telling you to do!

1129
01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:04.862
And if you don't do what
I'm telling you to do.

1130
01:01:04.862 --> 01:01:07.331
well then. you start thinking
about your own safety.

1131
01:01:08.766 --> 01:01:11.668
And the safety of your fucking
little pretty wife in there.

1132
01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:14.772
So that's what this has
come down to now. is it. Val?

1133
01:01:14.772 --> 01:01:16.040
Fucking threats?

1134
01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.975
Take it whatever the
fuck way you want it.

1135
01:01:17.975 --> 01:01:21.445
All's I'm telling you
is. get it fucking done!

1136
01:01:58.415 --> 01:02:00.517
I see you still have
that poxy look on your face

1137
01:02:00.517 --> 01:02:03.387
from this morning. so I presume
you got the penalty points.

1138
01:02:10.394 --> 01:02:12.662
What did you say to
me. you fucking tramp?!

1139
01:02:12.662 --> 01:02:13.898
You dirty slut!

1140
01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:18.335
I'm out there breaking
my bollocks every day

1141
01:02:18.335 --> 01:02:20.905
to put a roof over your head
and clothes on your back

1142
01:02:20.905 --> 01:02:23.808
and I have to come here and
listen to this shite from you!

1143
01:02:26.010 --> 01:02:27.878
If it wasn't for me you'd
be out sucking cocks

1144
01:02:27.878 --> 01:02:29.379
down at the canal!

1145
01:02:34.852 --> 01:02:36.253
Everything okay? We heard
screaming and shouting.

1146
01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:38.622
Everything is
fine. now fuck off!

1147
01:02:38.622 --> 01:02:39.890
Are you okay?

1148
01:02:39.890 --> 01:02:41.725
Who the fuck do
you think you are?

1149
01:02:41.725 --> 01:02:42.692
Get off my property.

1150
01:02:42.692 --> 01:02:44.128
Do you want to come with us?

1151
01:02:44.128 --> 01:02:45.896
We can get you a
safe place to stay.

1152
01:02:45.896 --> 01:02:48.365
She's going fucking
nowhere. she's staying here.

1153
01:02:48.365 --> 01:02:50.700
Fuck off and mind
yours own business.

1154
01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:53.137
It's you's that have him up
the fucking walls like this.

1155
01:02:53.137 --> 01:02:54.671
You're a very brave
man. aren't you?

1156
01:02:54.671 --> 01:02:56.874
I bet you feel like a real
hero slapping up women.

1157
01:02:56.874 --> 01:02:58.575
I will fucking
slap you up and down

1158
01:02:58.575 --> 01:02:59.844
that road out there. you prick.

1159
01:02:59.844 --> 01:03:02.212
Oh yeah? Give it
your best shot then!

1160
01:03:02.212 --> 01:03:03.680
Come on. take off your
badge and gun. then!

1161
01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.515
No problem.
let's go right now!

1162
01:03:05.515 --> 01:03:07.384
Come on. He's not worth it.

1163
01:03:07.384 --> 01:03:09.920
Go on. fuck off. you prick.

1164
01:04:00.304 --> 01:04:01.872
Are you okay?

1165
01:04:09.646 --> 01:04:11.381
Is it to do with Val?

1166
01:04:14.184 --> 01:04:15.552
You know. I'm
starting to think

1167
01:04:15.552 --> 01:04:17.922
that for every bad
decision someone makes.

1168
01:04:19.056 --> 01:04:20.925
it will eventually come
back to haunt them.

1169
01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:23.894
Esther. if we don't get
out now. we're gonna be-

1170
01:04:23.894 --> 01:04:25.295
What do you mean. get out?

1171
01:04:27.397 --> 01:04:30.134
I mean. cut loose. Get
away from all of this.

1172
01:04:31.936 --> 01:04:32.802
Like. emigrate?

1173
01:04:34.271 --> 01:04:36.941
We've plenty of cash. we
can move abroad. anywhere.

1174
01:04:39.043 --> 01:04:42.846
Alan. Are you sure that's
what you really want to do?

1175
01:04:44.814 --> 01:04:46.083
Just hit me today.

1176
01:04:46.951 --> 01:04:49.119
Seeing how Val has become.

1177
01:04:50.554 --> 01:04:53.223
especially when he tried
dragging you into this mess.

1178
01:04:55.392 --> 01:04:56.961
And what?

1179
01:04:56.961 --> 01:04:59.129
What do you think Val is
gonna say about all this?

1180
01:04:59.129 --> 01:05:00.364
About us going?

1181
01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:06.203
I'm gonna have a
word with him tomorrow.

1182
01:05:06.203 --> 01:05:07.204
Everything we've been through.

1183
01:05:07.204 --> 01:05:08.738
I think he's owes me this much.

1184
01:05:09.839 --> 01:05:11.075
And what if he says no?

1185
01:05:19.283 --> 01:05:22.386
You know I would do
anything for you.

1186
01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:25.289
Absolutely anything.

1187
01:05:28.392 --> 01:05:30.627
We'll sort
something out. yeah?

1188
01:05:30.627 --> 01:05:32.129
We always do.

1189
01:05:37.968 --> 01:05:39.103
You wanted to see me. Tom?

1190
01:05:39.103 --> 01:05:41.105
Ah. Liz. Come in.

1191
01:05:41.105 --> 01:05:41.905
Take a seat.

1192
01:05:46.143 --> 01:05:47.844
What's the problem?

1193
01:05:47.844 --> 01:05:50.981
This latest overt
surveillance on Fagan.

1194
01:05:50.981 --> 01:05:52.816
I need you to back off.

1195
01:05:52.816 --> 01:05:53.984
What?

1196
01:05:53.984 --> 01:05:55.419
Fagan is threatening to sue

1197
01:05:55.419 --> 01:05:58.322
for breach of civil
liberties and harassment.

1198
01:05:58.322 --> 01:06:02.526
Tom. Fagan is on
the verge of cracking.

1199
01:06:02.526 --> 01:06:05.062
I'm sorry. Liz. it's
not up for negotiation.

1200
01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:09.099
Look. maybe there are
other ways to get at Fagan.

1201
01:06:09.099 --> 01:06:10.834
Have a look at the
international aspect

1202
01:06:10.834 --> 01:06:12.336
of his operation. right?

1203
01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:24.981
With the Corrigans
coming over today.

1204
01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:27.384
I'm buzzing 'cause everything's
gonna come good finally.

1205
01:06:28.852 --> 01:06:30.920
Decco's gone to ground and
probably left the country.

1206
01:06:32.056 --> 01:06:33.590
And the cops have eased off.

1207
01:06:34.624 --> 01:06:35.825
Once Delahunt is out of the way

1208
01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:37.127
it'll be plain sailing.

1209
01:06:38.495 --> 01:06:40.464
Everything's falling
into place nicely.

1210
01:06:42.266 --> 01:06:43.200
You alright?

1211
01:06:44.268 --> 01:06:45.769
What's the story?

1212
01:06:45.769 --> 01:06:46.836
Did you get that done?

1213
01:06:46.836 --> 01:06:48.072
Sorted.

1214
01:06:48.072 --> 01:06:49.339
Fitted with a mercury
tilt trigger switch

1215
01:06:49.339 --> 01:06:51.275
mounted underneath
the driver's seat.

1216
01:06:51.275 --> 01:06:52.909
Go off as soon as
she sits in it.

1217
01:06:54.411 --> 01:06:55.245
Nice one.

1218
01:06:59.716 --> 01:07:01.451
Esther and me are
going away. Val.

1219
01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:04.321
Going away for good.

1220
01:07:05.389 --> 01:07:06.356
What do you mean?

1221
01:07:07.624 --> 01:07:10.427
This cop hit. it's
my last job. I'm done.

1222
01:07:11.628 --> 01:07:13.163
Renno. what the fuck
are you talking about?

1223
01:07:13.163 --> 01:07:16.266
It means I'm done. Val.
Finished with all of this.

1224
01:07:17.601 --> 01:07:20.537
It's like that cop Delahunt
said to you before.

1225
01:07:20.537 --> 01:07:22.739
it's only a matter of time
before someone smarter

1226
01:07:22.739 --> 01:07:25.109
and bolder comes along.
takes us all out.

1227
01:07:27.244 --> 01:07:30.880
I'm sick of looking over my
shoulder the whole time. Val.

1228
01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.416
I don't wanna go out like that.

1229
01:07:34.251 --> 01:07:36.753
Quit while you're ahead.
do you know what I mean?

1230
01:07:37.621 --> 01:07:39.289
So you're gonna run away

1231
01:07:40.624 --> 01:07:41.691
like a little chicken shit?

1232
01:07:41.691 --> 01:07:43.760
For fuck's sake. Val.

1233
01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:45.829
I don't wanna fall out
with you over this.

1234
01:07:47.197 --> 01:07:49.299
Been through enough
together. pal. you and me.

1235
01:07:50.534 --> 01:07:51.735
Fuck it. Renno.

1236
01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:55.004
You deserve a break.
you and Esther head off

1237
01:07:55.004 --> 01:07:56.840
and have a good think about
it and then get back to me.

1238
01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:59.008
Sorry. Val. I've
already thought it over.

1239
01:08:00.210 --> 01:08:02.646
I'm done. Finished. for good.

1240
01:08:09.153 --> 01:08:10.420
Okay. so.

1241
01:08:12.856 --> 01:08:13.657
So be it.

1242
01:08:16.726 --> 01:08:17.627
Best of luck. pal.

1243
01:08:19.863 --> 01:08:21.131
Thanks. Val.

1244
01:08:22.332 --> 01:08:24.601
For everything that
you've done for me.

1245
01:08:25.635 --> 01:08:27.604
I appreciate it. I'm grateful.

1246
01:08:37.481 --> 01:08:38.748
- Oh. how are you. Renno?
- Hey.

1247
01:08:38.748 --> 01:08:40.284
Are you not staying?

1248
01:08:40.284 --> 01:08:41.718
Nah. just popped in for
a quick chat with himself.

1249
01:08:41.718 --> 01:08:43.787
Alright. I'll see
you later. yeah?

1250
01:08:57.033 --> 01:08:58.702
I'm starving. doing my head in.

1251
01:08:58.702 --> 01:09:00.204
Let's get something to eat.

1252
01:09:00.204 --> 01:09:01.971
Come on. I'll see to you.

1253
01:09:01.971 --> 01:09:02.972
Right. come on.

1254
01:09:05.709 --> 01:09:08.212
Fuck
you. Renno. And your wife.

1255
01:09:10.046 --> 01:09:11.581
Worried that someone
smarter and bolder

1256
01:09:11.581 --> 01:09:12.616
is gonna take us out?

1257
01:09:14.418 --> 01:09:15.785
Not in my city.

1258
01:09:20.324 --> 01:09:23.092
And you think you and your
wife can just up and leave?

1259
01:09:27.163 --> 01:09:29.666
There's only one
place you's are going.

1260
01:10:15.612 --> 01:10:17.514
Hang on. they're just
coming through now.

1261
01:10:23.987 --> 01:10:26.956
Cigire? The intel report
from Interpol arrived.

1262
01:10:26.956 --> 01:10:28.792
Oh. thanks. Aisling.

1263
01:11:56.012 --> 01:11:56.813
Yeah?

1264
01:12:01.585 --> 01:12:02.919
He's in the pub.

1265
01:12:27.777 --> 01:12:28.978
So what is it?

1266
01:12:28.978 --> 01:12:30.313
American.

1267
01:12:30.313 --> 01:12:31.515
Executive class.

1268
01:12:31.515 --> 01:12:32.949
Very fancy.

1269
01:12:32.949 --> 01:12:33.783
Oh yeah.

1270
01:12:35.018 --> 01:12:37.253
I tell you. as soon
as this meeting is over.

1271
01:12:37.253 --> 01:12:39.423
I'm gonna get myself one
of them Latvian ladies.

1272
01:12:39.423 --> 01:12:40.757
What. them escorts?

1273
01:12:40.757 --> 01:12:41.958
Yeah.

1274
01:12:41.958 --> 01:12:43.660
I'm dying for my hole.

1275
01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:45.562
You. that's all you
ever fucking think of.

1276
01:12:45.562 --> 01:12:47.063
you and your hole.

1277
01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:25.935
Look. Dad. it's
the Grim Reaper.

1278
01:14:13.583 --> 01:14:15.451
Now. get everything out.

1279
01:14:17.153 --> 01:14:18.988
I'm sorry I'm doing
it this morning.

1280
01:14:18.988 --> 01:14:19.923
Get the fuck out.

1281
01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:22.952
Gangland.

1282
01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:25.822
The dark side of society.

1283
01:15:27.624 --> 01:15:30.159
The underbelly of everyday
life is a real and dark place

1284
01:15:30.159 --> 01:15:31.695
where even the innocent suffer.

1285
01:15:36.199 --> 01:15:37.400
And being the boss of this place

1286
01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:38.702
isn't about how
much money you have

1287
01:15:38.702 --> 01:15:40.203
or how much power you have.

1288
01:15:42.806 --> 01:15:44.473
But it's about how
long you can stay alive

1289
01:15:44.473 --> 01:15:45.642
when you're at the top.

1290
01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:50.479
This is how long I last.

1291
01:16:17.874 --> 01:16:19.643
It's all yours now.
