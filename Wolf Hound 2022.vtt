00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:46.122
How we doing over there. boys?

4
00:02:46.253 --> 00:02:47.819
We have a winner yet?

5
00:02:49.604 --> 00:02:51.910
<i>Hey. Friedman.</i>
<i>you reading me over there?</i>

6
00:02:59.483 --> 00:03:02.182
Do you really gotta play
that damn thing right now?

7
00:03:02.312 --> 00:03:05.663
Is it. uh. messing up
your concentration?

8
00:03:05.794 --> 00:03:09.189
- Yeah.
- Then. yes. I do.

9
00:03:26.728 --> 00:03:29.644
Friedman. you're such
a pain in the ass
with that recorder.

10
00:03:30.297 --> 00:03:31.646
Watch this.

11
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.789
Whoa. whoa. God. Thompson!

12
00:03:58.368 --> 00:04:00.240
- Hey!
- Dammit. Thompson. I had him!

13
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.591
Oh? You had me?
I had one move and it was over.

14
00:04:03.721 --> 00:04:05.897
- Oh. is that right?
- They seem to think
that it's funny that--

15
00:04:06.028 --> 00:04:07.682
Cut the crap!

16
00:04:07.812 --> 00:04:10.554
McAllister. get back
to the top turret.

17
00:04:10.685 --> 00:04:12.730
<i>If Jerry's out there.</i>
<i>I wanna be prepared.</i>

18
00:04:18.083 --> 00:04:19.389
I can't believe this.

19
00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.619
Skies are clear for miles.
Lieutenant.

20
00:04:32.794 --> 00:04:34.709
<i>Jerry's still sleeping.</i>

21
00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:36.058
How's it look. Wilson?

22
00:04:36.188 --> 00:04:39.061
Might help if I knew
what I was looking for.

23
00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:47.243
<i>Looks pretty dull</i>
<i>from where I'm sitting.</i>

24
00:04:47.374 --> 00:04:50.768
Which. by the way.
is still very uncomfortable.

25
00:04:52.944 --> 00:04:57.079
For the last time Dixon.
I hear you and I don't care.

26
00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:03.477
- No offense--
- Here we go.

27
00:05:03.607 --> 00:05:07.089
No seriously fellas.
what the hell
are doing up here anyway?

28
00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:08.960
You know the answer
to that. Lieutenant.

29
00:05:09.091 --> 00:05:11.180
All they tell us is
"need to know."

30
00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:14.314
<i>Come on. Finn.</i>
<i>it's "Search and Destroy"</i>

31
00:05:14.444 --> 00:05:16.794
find the Nazi base.
take her out.

32
00:05:16.925 --> 00:05:19.057
<i>Oh. yeah. sure.</i>

33
00:05:19.188 --> 00:05:20.668
Could ya find
this damn needle. too?

34
00:05:20.798 --> 00:05:21.756
I left it over in this haystack.

35
00:05:21.886 --> 00:05:23.279
Stow it. Sergeant.

36
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.760
Jerry moves this base
every time we spot it.

37
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.328
This time. we're not
giving them the chance.

38
00:05:28.458 --> 00:05:31.548
So I need everyone.
and I mean everyone...

39
00:05:33.028 --> 00:05:35.944
stay focused and keep sharp.

40
00:05:36.074 --> 00:05:38.207
<i>Should be</i>
<i>almost there now. sir.</i>

41
00:05:49.827 --> 00:05:51.742
You really think we're gonna
find anything out here?

42
00:05:51.873 --> 00:05:53.440
<i>That's not our job.</i>

43
00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:57.705
You and I. we just keep
Yankee Lady flying.

44
00:05:57.835 --> 00:05:59.576
<i>Still got that compass</i>
<i>I gave ya?</i>

45
00:06:01.317 --> 00:06:05.234
Yeah. It's fancy.

46
00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:08.803
I don't think
this cute little thing's

47
00:06:08.933 --> 00:06:10.195
gonna point to any Nazi base.

48
00:06:10.326 --> 00:06:12.415
No. but it'll
get your sorry ass home.

49
00:06:12.546 --> 00:06:15.723
It better. too.
I need that back.

50
00:06:15.853 --> 00:06:18.203
That was given to me by
a pretty little thing back home.

51
00:06:18.334 --> 00:06:19.553
Oh. yeah?

52
00:06:19.683 --> 00:06:21.903
<i>Why don't you keep it. then?</i>

53
00:06:22.033 --> 00:06:24.471
Because I'm not the one
afraid I ain't gonna
make it home.

54
00:06:24.601 --> 00:06:26.647
I don't know. Jack.

55
00:06:26.777 --> 00:06:28.953
How many Nazi targets
you see bombed daily?

56
00:06:30.477 --> 00:06:31.869
<i>We're hitting them</i>
<i>where it hurts.</i>

57
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.393
<i>I mean.</i>
<i>if I'm going to risk myself.</i>

58
00:06:33.523 --> 00:06:34.655
getting shot down.
at least let me do it

59
00:06:34.785 --> 00:06:36.091
on the front lines.

60
00:06:36.221 --> 00:06:37.179
<i>No. I get it.</i>

61
00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:38.615
I'll call up Berlin.

62
00:06:38.746 --> 00:06:40.704
set up a boxing match
between you and Adolf.

63
00:06:41.444 --> 00:06:42.489
<i>Ha!</i>

64
00:06:42.619 --> 00:06:44.404
Yeah. I'll put my money
on the Jew!

65
00:06:45.448 --> 00:06:47.232
- Smart.
- <i>Yeah. Holden.</i>

66
00:06:47.363 --> 00:06:49.017
I'll bet you
got a lot of relatives

67
00:06:49.147 --> 00:06:51.759
- who'd line up
to take a swing at der Fuhrer.

68
00:06:52.716 --> 00:06:53.935
<i>Trust me. kid.</i>

69
00:06:54.065 --> 00:06:56.720
one man can make
an impact on this war.

70
00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:01.508
Just maybe not
the way you think.

71
00:07:01.638 --> 00:07:03.205
I mean. have you guys
heard the rumors

72
00:07:03.335 --> 00:07:04.424
of what's going on down there?

73
00:07:04.554 --> 00:07:06.251
Those are just rumors. David.

74
00:07:06.382 --> 00:07:07.818
And if they're true?

75
00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:09.994
We should be going in there.
guns blazing.

76
00:07:10.125 --> 00:07:11.648
making sure they aren't.

77
00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:13.607
We do good work up here. Holden.

78
00:07:13.737 --> 00:07:16.000
and you need us
just as much as we need you.

79
00:07:16.131 --> 00:07:19.917
- Is that so?
- Lieutenant Rodgers.
tell me we're close.

80
00:07:20.048 --> 00:07:23.051
Based on intel.
we should be coming up

81
00:07:23.181 --> 00:07:26.924
on the suspected target's
visual range now. sir.

82
00:07:28.012 --> 00:07:30.275
Alright. everyone clam up.

83
00:07:30.406 --> 00:07:32.756
<i>Radio's off</i>
<i>until further notice.</i>

84
00:07:40.416 --> 00:07:41.461
Jack. you see that?

85
00:07:45.943 --> 00:07:48.032
Where? How many?

86
00:07:48.163 --> 00:07:50.034
Seven o'clock.
Looks like two fighters.

87
00:07:51.862 --> 00:07:53.690
<i>Out of range</i>
<i>but coming in fast.</i>

88
00:07:55.692 --> 00:07:58.652
Alright. you know the drill.

89
00:07:58.782 --> 00:08:00.654
<i>Do your job</i>
<i>and we all get home.</i>

90
00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:02.569
Hold on...

91
00:08:07.312 --> 00:08:08.444
That's not Jerry.

92
00:08:13.797 --> 00:08:15.103
No.

93
00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:19.847
<i>Those are RAF fighters.</i>

94
00:08:19.977 --> 00:08:22.066
Looks like a Spitfire
and a Hurricane.

95
00:08:27.898 --> 00:08:29.552
Crazy Brits.

96
00:08:29.683 --> 00:08:31.554
Harry. try to get them
on the box.

97
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.819
Whew. I almost
swallowed my Beeman's.

98
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:37.386
<i>This is B-17 Yankee Lady</i>

99

<i>to Spitfire and Hurricane.</i>

100
00:08:39.431 --> 00:08:40.911
For a second there
I thought we were gonna

00:08:41.042 --> 00:08:43.044
<i>have a rough morning.</i>

102
00:08:43.174 --> 00:08:44.872

Captain.

106
00:08:54.664 --> 00:08:56.318
<i>scheduled to be out today?</i>

107
00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:59.974
No. Not that I know of.

108
00:09:00.104 --> 00:09:02.063
<i>Do you copy?</i>
<i>Please identify yourself.</i>

109
00:09:02.193 --> 00:09:04.282
<i>This is Yankee Lady.</i>

110
00:09:04.413 --> 00:09:05.806
No response. sir.

111
00:09:05.936 --> 00:09:07.895
I'm not getting
anything from them.

112
00:09:08.025 --> 00:09:09.723
Hey. maybe their radios
are down?

113
00:09:09.853 --> 00:09:11.202

<i>Radio shot in battle. </i>
<i>now they're on their way home.</i>

117
00:09:19.036 --> 00:09:21.299
I got a bad feeling about this.
Jack.

118
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:22.474
Quit your worrying.

119
00:09:22.605 --> 00:09:24.389

<i>I'm a sitting duck</i>

124

<i>Thompson. they are</i>
<i>right on our tail!</i>

125
00:09:47.456 --> 00:09:48.413
They're not veering.

126
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:50.285
Uh. Thompson...

127
00:09:52.461 --> 00:09:56.160

Shit.

<i>Breaking right. Breaking right! </i>
<i>Holden. on my way.</i>

- Report in!
- Ball turret and tail gunner
took heavy damage.

134
00:10:51.259 --> 00:10:53.696
Didn't see they were Krauts
until they were
right on top of us!

135
00:11:00.442 --> 00:11:02.705
<i>Holden. don't fire</i>
<i>until you have a clean shot</i>

136
00:11:02.836 --> 00:11:04.185
<i>or you'll run out of ammo</i>
<i>real fast.</i>

137

<i>You hear me?</i>

138
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.188

Is this the kind of action
you wanted. David?

148
00:11:51.449 --> 00:11:52.494
Uh...

149
00:11:58.195 --> 00:12:00.371

- Roger. Holden.
- <i>I'm going left.</i>

154

00:15:04.338 --> 00:15:05.426
<i>I read you. Jack.</i>

173
00:15:06.818 --> 00:15:08.255
<i>I'm on my way!</i>

174
00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.090
<i>This guy's all over me.</i>

175
00:15:18.134 --> 00:15:19.744
Jesus! Jesus.

176
00:15:19.875 --> 00:15:21.007
<i>My controls are failing.</i>

177
00:15:21.137 --> 00:15:22.573
<i>Holden.</i>
<i>where the hell are you?!</i>

178
00:15:30.059 --> 00:15:33.323
David! David!

179
00:15:34.759 --> 00:15:35.891
Jack. get out of there!

180
00:16:09.229 --> 00:16:11.448
He made it! He made it. OK.

181
00:16:17.802 --> 00:16:20.544
Friedman. send out
a distress call. this location.

182
00:16:22.198 --> 00:16:23.199
We should--

183
00:16:25.723 --> 00:16:27.595
No survivors.

184
00:16:37.605 --> 00:16:38.606
No!

185
00:16:47.397 --> 00:16:48.572
Oh. my God...

186
00:17:35.924 --> 00:17:37.099
We're hit!

187
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.884
<i>It's critical!</i>
<i>We're going down!</i>

188
00:17:40.015 --> 00:17:41.712
Repeat. we are going down!

189
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:50.199
No. No! Dammit!

190
00:18:01.515 --> 00:18:03.473
<i>Holden.</i>
<i>you've got one on your tail!</i>

191
00:18:03.604 --> 00:18:05.084
Not for long.

192
00:18:21.665 --> 00:18:23.450
<i>We're losing altitude.</i>

193
00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.539
Everybody hold on!

194
00:18:31.153 --> 00:18:33.503
Alright. you son of a bitch.

195
00:19:07.885 --> 00:19:09.365
Erich...

196
00:19:38.829 --> 00:19:40.266
Brace for impact!

197
00:19:41.484 --> 00:19:43.182
<i>Landing strip! I see it!</i>

198
00:19:43.312 --> 00:19:45.445
We're gonna try
to take her down there!

199
00:19:45.575 --> 00:19:49.275
<i>Wait a minute. shit!</i>
<i>That's no landing strip!</i>

200
00:19:49.405 --> 00:19:51.712
<i>It's the goddamn Nazi base </i>
<i>and it's crawling with Krauts!</i>

201
00:19:51.842 --> 00:19:54.062
- Thompson!

202
00:20:09.033 --> 00:20:10.644
You Nazi bastard.

203
00:20:50.553 --> 00:20:52.163
Shit!

204
00:21:22.106 --> 00:21:23.238
Whoa!

205
00:21:56.532 --> 00:21:58.447
Whoa! Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa!

206
00:21:58.578 --> 00:21:59.927
Oh. come on. Come on.

207
00:22:01.407 --> 00:22:02.495
Whoa. whoa. whoa!

208
00:22:06.237 --> 00:22:07.761
Ah!

209
00:22:16.813 --> 00:22:18.641
Holy shit.

210
00:22:26.388 --> 00:22:27.955
Whoa!

211
00:24:07.446 --> 00:24:13.277
Let's see.
Jerry shot us down about here.

212
00:24:13.408 --> 00:24:14.714
North is the crash site.

213
00:24:18.544 --> 00:24:19.806
West is home.

214
00:24:29.511 --> 00:24:30.773
What do you think. bud?

215
00:24:40.435 --> 00:24:42.481
If there's a chance
they're still alive...

216
00:24:48.574 --> 00:24:49.923
OK. Jack.

217
00:24:52.403 --> 00:24:53.535
You win.

218
00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:45.195
Colonel Krieger. sir!

219
00:26:51.697 --> 00:26:54.177
What is this?

220
00:26:57.224 --> 00:26:58.268
Take him.

221
00:26:59.792 --> 00:27:01.750
No. no. no! No. wait!

222
00:27:01.881 --> 00:27:06.015
- No! Where are you taking me?

223
00:27:06.146 --> 00:27:07.626
Thompson! Thompson!

224
00:27:08.757 --> 00:27:10.193
Thompson! Help me!

225
00:27:10.324 --> 00:27:11.847
Thompson! Thompson!

226
00:27:11.978 --> 00:27:12.848
Where are you taking him?

227
00:27:12.979 --> 00:27:15.242
You Kraut son of a bitch!

228
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:31.519
I'm OK. I'm OK.

229
00:27:37.699 --> 00:27:38.961
I'm sorry about your friend.

230
00:27:42.573 --> 00:27:44.010
After they take you. well...

231
00:27:45.576 --> 00:27:47.274
Not many come back.

232
00:27:47.404 --> 00:27:49.929
Hey. buddy.
why don't you just
mind your own business. huh?

233
00:27:50.712 --> 00:27:52.279
Suit yourself.

234
00:27:52.409 --> 00:27:54.411
Thompson. we gotta find
a way out of here.

235
00:27:55.325 --> 00:27:57.719
Finn. is that you?

236
00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:00.287
Holy shit. it's Lockport!

237
00:28:00.417 --> 00:28:02.506
The RAF guy we did ops with!

238
00:28:02.637 --> 00:28:04.552
Oh. boy.
we thought you was toast.

239
00:28:04.683 --> 00:28:06.902
Well. I can say
I've been better.

240
00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:14.693
They took Johnny...
my wingman.

241
00:28:16.433 --> 00:28:20.481
I wasn't sure
if I should be happy

242
00:28:20.611 --> 00:28:23.353
or cry when the screams stopped.

243
00:28:25.965 --> 00:28:29.272
Lockport. tell me
you guys thought of a plan

244
00:28:29.403 --> 00:28:30.491
to get out of here.

245
00:28:33.842 --> 00:28:35.583
Sorry. old boy.

246
00:28:36.932 --> 00:28:39.282
We're stuck here until the end.
I'm afraid.

247
00:29:54.009 --> 00:29:56.011
Alright. halt!

248
00:29:58.057 --> 00:29:59.493
We will rest for a moment.

249
00:30:04.585 --> 00:30:09.851
Two pilots shot down
and Standartenfuhrer
has left me to clean it up.

250
00:30:12.114 --> 00:30:15.901
We are lucky they found
the American bomber intact.

251
00:30:16.031 --> 00:30:19.034
Krieger would not survive
such failure.

252
00:30:20.296 --> 00:30:23.299
I do not care for his pilots.

253
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:26.259
Nor the faith he places in them.

254
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:28.783
You do not win wars with faith.

255
00:30:28.914 --> 00:30:32.700
Krieger is weak.
you see how he treats them.

256
00:30:32.831 --> 00:30:36.878
The Roth Brothers.
like his own sons.

257
00:30:40.969 --> 00:30:42.579
Would it be so bad
if they were dead?

258
00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:50.370
Two corpses would be
much easier to explain
to der Fuhrer.

259
00:30:54.026 --> 00:30:58.769
Do not forget our orders:
no survivors!

260
00:32:28.207 --> 00:32:30.644
Fritz! Let's go!

261
00:32:30.774 --> 00:32:33.777
They've found the crash-site.
Move out!

262
00:33:14.905 --> 00:33:17.299
Come. Sit.

263
00:33:19.867 --> 00:33:22.696
Talk with me... Harrison.

264
00:33:24.828 --> 00:33:26.482
This is your name. yes?

265
00:33:31.444 --> 00:33:35.274
Harrison... Friedman.

266
00:34:00.081 --> 00:34:01.300
Mm.

267
00:34:05.217 --> 00:34:10.526
When I was small.
oh. much younger than you.

268
00:34:10.657 --> 00:34:14.617
a boy of no more than
nine or ten.

269
00:34:14.748 --> 00:34:17.794
I remember my mother
used to sing to me.

270
00:34:19.318 --> 00:34:24.366
Each night she would sing.
"In Stiller Nacht".

271
00:34:24.497 --> 00:34:25.498
Do you know it?

272
00:34:28.066 --> 00:34:33.158
Oh. shame. it's lovely.

273
00:34:35.334 --> 00:34:39.251
When I was sad.
she would sing.

274
00:35:00.663 --> 00:35:04.537
I fought in the last war.
do you know this?

275
00:35:05.668 --> 00:35:07.453
Oh.

276
00:35:09.019 --> 00:35:11.109
I even fought
beside men like you.

277
00:35:12.762 --> 00:35:14.938
I once called a Jew
my brother.

278
00:35:17.158 --> 00:35:21.380
Oh. this was long ago.

279
00:35:22.729 --> 00:35:27.037
After the war ended.
I came home.

280
00:35:28.778 --> 00:35:31.651
It was not the same.

281
00:35:32.739 --> 00:35:34.567
Germany was not strong.

282
00:35:34.697 --> 00:35:36.134
We were not proud.

283
00:35:38.048 --> 00:35:41.269
I remember
how sick my mother was

284
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:45.055
when the man from the bank came.

285
00:35:45.186 --> 00:35:48.755
You can imagine my surprise
when I saw that it was him.

286
00:35:48.885 --> 00:35:51.714
it was my brother. the Jew!

287
00:35:53.499 --> 00:35:56.241
I told my mother.
"Have no fear. I know this man.

288
00:35:56.371 --> 00:35:59.418
He is a good man."

289
00:36:01.159 --> 00:36:08.035
So I spoke with my brother.
begged him to leave us be.

290
00:36:12.126 --> 00:36:13.910
Do you know what he said?

291
00:36:17.175 --> 00:36:21.788
<i>"Dies ist leben."</i>
"This is life"

292
00:36:21.918 --> 00:36:24.312
This Jew took my home!

293
00:36:24.443 --> 00:36:27.010
This Jew made me a liar
to my own mother!

294
00:36:27.141 --> 00:36:30.405
How she cried.
The way she looked at me!

295
00:36:36.542 --> 00:36:40.720
My mother died.
cold and alone.

296
00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:44.898
because my "brother"
stabbed me in the back!

297
00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:57.780
I made sure I was there
when we took him.

298
00:37:00.957 --> 00:37:04.613
I made sure we took
his whole family to the trains.

299
00:37:08.051 --> 00:37:09.488
Do you know what he did?

300
00:37:11.141 --> 00:37:13.666
He begged me!

301
00:37:18.497 --> 00:37:20.890
Begged me to let them stay.

302
00:37:22.979 --> 00:37:24.720
Do you know what I said?

303
00:37:26.983 --> 00:37:30.639
<i>"Dies... ist... leben."</i>

304
00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:41.128
I will cherish
this memory forever.

305
00:38:02.541 --> 00:38:05.674
Do you remember the song
I sang to you earlier?

306
00:38:05.805 --> 00:38:07.285
"In Stiller Nacht"?

307
00:38:09.548 --> 00:38:12.159
It's been so long
since I've heard it.

308
00:38:17.033 --> 00:38:18.818
Do you think you could?

309
00:38:20.341 --> 00:38:24.171
Oh... please...

310
00:38:25.912 --> 00:38:29.176
it would make me very happy.

311
00:38:32.266 --> 00:38:33.572
Go ahead.

312
00:38:39.578 --> 00:38:40.579
Mm.

313
00:38:57.726 --> 00:38:59.206
That's enough.

314
00:39:02.427 --> 00:39:04.211

- Oh!

Do you think you're in pain?
Does it hurt?

333

You don't know
anything about pain.

334
00:47:26.147 --> 00:47:29.194
They will beat you.
they will break you.

335
00:47:29.324 --> 00:47:30.978
and they will do it
all over again.

336
00:47:31.109 --> 00:47:33.502
We do not have the luxury
to be weak.

337
00:47:33.633 --> 00:47:34.939
So wake up!

338
00:47:35.069 --> 00:47:36.854
Do not give them
that satisfaction.

339
00:47:38.986 --> 00:47:41.336
Come on. easy.

340
00:47:44.731 --> 00:47:47.647
Good.
Maybe you are not so weak.

341
00:47:47.777 --> 00:47:48.953
Who the hell is this broad?

342
00:47:49.083 --> 00:47:52.391
Marie St. Laurent.

343
00:47:52.521 --> 00:47:55.785
From what I gather.
she's a French Resistance
fighter.

344
00:47:55.916 --> 00:47:58.049
Been here longer
than any of us.

345
00:47:58.179 --> 00:48:02.053
Hey. I know we didn't get off
on a good foot before.

346
00:48:02.183 --> 00:48:05.665
But the way I figure it.
we're all stuck here.

347
00:48:05.795 --> 00:48:08.363
So it don't matter what you
think about me or Robert.

348
00:48:08.494 --> 00:48:09.712
Today. we're brothers.

349
00:48:14.282 --> 00:48:15.457
And you are?

350
00:48:15.588 --> 00:48:17.546
Private George Jackson.

351
00:48:17.677 --> 00:48:19.418
Me and Robert Wright were
driving the Red Ball Express

352
00:48:19.548 --> 00:48:20.898
when the krauts got us.

353
00:48:21.028 --> 00:48:22.769
What the hell
is the Red Ball Express?

354
00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:24.031
It's a new unit.

355
00:48:24.162 --> 00:48:25.990
We drive trucks
carrying supplies

356
00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:27.295
all over the front.

357
00:48:27.426 --> 00:48:30.124
We were on route
from Cherbourg last week.

358
00:48:30.255 --> 00:48:32.300
bringing repair equipment
for heavy aircraft.

359
00:48:32.431 --> 00:48:34.085
We think that's why
they hit us.

360
00:48:34.215 --> 00:48:36.522
They're using our supplies
to repair that bomber out there.

361
00:48:36.652 --> 00:48:38.654
Any news on Friedman?

362
00:48:38.785 --> 00:48:39.917
We overheard one of the guards

363
00:48:40.047 --> 00:48:41.483
saying they were
transferring him.

364
00:48:41.614 --> 00:48:42.832
To where?

365
00:48:42.963 --> 00:48:44.922
You don't wanna know.

366
00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:47.620
Easy. Cap.
you're pretty busted up.

367
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:49.578
No. we gotta get Harry.

368
00:48:49.709 --> 00:48:51.580
- They're gonna kill him.
We have bigger problems.

369
00:48:51.711 --> 00:48:54.322
We were scouting
this facility for weeks.

370
00:48:54.453 --> 00:48:57.673
They captured us.
but not before we found out
what was happening.

371
00:48:57.804 --> 00:48:58.979
What are they up to?

372
00:48:59.110 --> 00:49:00.894
They have developed something

373
00:49:01.025 --> 00:49:02.374
called a "wunderwaffe."

374
00:49:02.504 --> 00:49:03.984
English. lady.

375
00:49:04.115 --> 00:49:07.031
It means "super weapon."

376
00:49:07.161 --> 00:49:08.684
From what I can tell.

377
00:49:08.815 --> 00:49:12.645
it's a single bomb that could
destroy an entire city.

378
00:49:12.775 --> 00:49:15.865
One bomb? I don't believe it.

379
00:49:15.996 --> 00:49:17.650
Believe whatever you want!

380
00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:21.262
OK. so they got a big bomb.
Does it work?

381
00:49:24.135 --> 00:49:26.311
Great. And if it does.

382
00:49:26.441 --> 00:49:28.748
what the hell are we
supposed to do about it?

383
00:49:28.878 --> 00:49:30.750
We gotta find a way out of here.

384
00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:34.406
I'm telling you. it's gonna take
a miracle to get us out of here.

385
00:49:34.536 --> 00:49:36.625
Then we need a miracle.

386
00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:01.911
Roth.

387
00:50:04.610 --> 00:50:06.133
Well. now I have a name.

388
00:50:24.151 --> 00:50:26.806
Who needs German
when you speak pilot?

389
00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:28.764
So. we're here.

390
00:50:28.895 --> 00:50:30.331
Which means Yankee Lady...

391
00:50:31.854 --> 00:50:34.205
could have landed right there.
That is not that far.

392
00:50:36.424 --> 00:50:37.860
OK.

393
00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:42.735
OK.

394
00:51:01.101 --> 00:51:02.407
Wait a second.

395
00:51:05.932 --> 00:51:08.717
No. No.

396
00:51:19.467 --> 00:51:21.904
They're gonna use our bombers
to level London.

397
00:51:24.168 --> 00:51:25.995
Those sons of...

398
00:51:50.324 --> 00:51:54.763
Well. Jack. you did say
one man can make a difference.

399
00:51:55.808 --> 00:51:57.070
Let's find out.

400
00:52:00.856 --> 00:52:02.336
Please. be careful.

401
00:52:02.467 --> 00:52:04.077
No!

402
00:52:04.208 --> 00:52:05.209
Yes. better.

403
00:52:15.088 --> 00:52:18.091
Doctor.
are you sure we are safe?

404
00:52:18.222 --> 00:52:21.007
Oh. uh. completely safe.
Herr Standartenfuhrer

405
00:52:21.138 --> 00:52:25.794
But that does not mean
they should not be more careful!

406
00:52:25.925 --> 00:52:30.016
Captain. see to it this payload
is safely installed.

407
00:52:33.759 --> 00:52:35.021
Show me the weapon.

408
00:53:23.156 --> 00:53:25.071
"A pretty little thing
back home."

409
00:53:30.468 --> 00:53:34.428
All this time.
there was only one. huh?

410
00:54:52.898 --> 00:54:54.465
I must be out of my mind.

411
00:55:36.463 --> 00:55:37.508
Yes!

412
00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:18.113
What's going on up there?

413
00:56:52.321 --> 00:56:54.802
Fall back. fall back!

414
01:00:01.728 --> 01:00:03.164
My brother.

415
01:00:58.829 --> 01:01:00.178
Come on. Holden.

416
01:01:01.179 --> 01:01:02.136
Focus.

417
01:01:02.267 --> 01:01:05.052
OK. OK. OK.

418
01:01:56.538 --> 01:01:58.889
<i>Is this the kind of</i>
<i>action you wanted. David?</i>

419
01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.589
<i>Holden.</i>
<i>where the hell are you?</i>

420
01:02:20.432 --> 01:02:22.521
Heil Hitler. Major!

421
01:02:22.651 --> 01:02:25.437
We have been searching for you
and the captain.

422
01:02:25.567 --> 01:02:27.918
as well as the American pilot.

423
01:02:29.223 --> 01:02:31.965
The captain is dead.
Report.

424
01:02:32.096 --> 01:02:33.793
We were ambushed. sir.

425
01:02:33.924 --> 01:02:36.883
Six dead.
three seriously wounded.

426
01:02:37.014 --> 01:02:39.973
I have our remaining men
searching the forest
for the soldier.

427
01:02:42.367 --> 01:02:47.198
Soldier? One soldier?

428
01:02:50.418 --> 01:02:53.639
You let one soldier
defeat an entire patrol?

429
01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:55.380
We believe
he may be wounded.

430
01:02:55.510 --> 01:03:00.254
Captain. your men are in need
of medical attention.

431
01:03:00.385 --> 01:03:03.257
Return to base
and give a full report.

432
01:03:03.388 --> 01:03:05.433
I will find the American.

433
01:03:05.564 --> 01:03:08.828
- My orders were to find you
and the captain--
- There is no time to argue.

434
01:03:08.959 --> 01:03:10.351
I know. sir.

435
01:03:15.226 --> 01:03:20.535
Your disgraceful display will be
included in my report. Captain.

436
01:03:22.363 --> 01:03:27.716
Unless. of course.
I retrieve the soldier for you.

437
01:03:27.847 --> 01:03:31.590
Perhaps then you
will not seem so inept.

438
01:03:40.512 --> 01:03:42.253
I am sorry. sir.

439
01:03:43.645 --> 01:03:46.953
I cannot disobey orders.

440
01:04:00.575 --> 01:04:02.273
So. what if one of us
fakes sick?

441
01:04:02.403 --> 01:04:04.928
Guard opens the door.
we jump him.

442
01:04:05.058 --> 01:04:07.147
take his gun
and bolt to freedom?

443
01:04:07.278 --> 01:04:08.801
Yeah. I like how that sounds.

444
01:04:08.932 --> 01:04:11.848
Won't work. These Krauts
don't care about us.

445
01:04:11.978 --> 01:04:14.938
The minute they walk in here.
we're dead.

446
01:04:15.068 --> 01:04:16.591
Well. we can't just sit here
and do nothing.

447
01:04:16.722 --> 01:04:18.419
they're gonna kill us
no matter what!

448
01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:25.383
Maybe we should. uh.
all be brainstorming. here?

449
01:04:25.513 --> 01:04:27.080
Wouldn't waste your breath.

450
01:04:27.211 --> 01:04:28.908
Why. what's her problem?

451
01:04:29.039 --> 01:04:30.301
I don't know how long she's
been here.

452
01:04:30.431 --> 01:04:33.043
but I can tell you
I wouldn't start nothing.

453
01:04:33.173 --> 01:04:36.133
About a week ago.
one of those guards
thought he'd get cute.

454
01:04:36.263 --> 01:04:38.875
They yanked her out.
didn't get very far.

455
01:04:39.005 --> 01:04:41.442
She came back real fast.
blood all over her face.

456
01:04:41.573 --> 01:04:42.530
Why. what happened?

457
01:04:42.661 --> 01:04:44.706
Guard tried to get friendly.

458
01:04:45.142 --> 01:04:46.795
She bit the tongue
out of his mouth.

459
01:04:51.148 --> 01:04:53.672
Boy. I gotta get out of here.

460
01:04:53.802 --> 01:04:56.109
We all gotta get out of here.

461
01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:58.459
Now. ideas. let's hear 'em.

462
01:05:01.941 --> 01:05:03.551
What about you. Lockport?

463
01:05:04.857 --> 01:05:06.163
- Lockport?
- Lockport?

464
01:05:06.293 --> 01:05:07.642
Hey!

465
01:05:10.602 --> 01:05:12.865
Sorry about that.

466
01:05:12.996 --> 01:05:16.303
It's just these walls.

467
01:05:17.652 --> 01:05:20.655
These same goddamn walls.

468
01:05:22.048 --> 01:05:23.180
It's so cramped in here.

469
01:05:24.703 --> 01:05:26.661
Even more than before.

470
01:05:28.533 --> 01:05:30.665
I guess I don't like
being cooped up.

471
01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:33.668
Pilot for a reason. you know.

472
01:05:35.279 --> 01:05:38.412
Cap. I'm not liking
the look in his eyes.

473
01:05:41.850 --> 01:05:43.287
What's that supposed to mean?

474
01:05:43.417 --> 01:05:46.464
It means I don't know you.

475
01:05:46.594 --> 01:05:48.205
and I don't know
what to do with you.

476
01:05:49.423 --> 01:05:51.686
What. you think
I'm some spy?

477
01:05:52.252 --> 01:05:56.126
All I know is
it was your plane
that shot mine down.

478
01:05:56.256 --> 01:05:59.085
If you hadn't got captured.
I sure as hell wouldn't be here.

479
01:05:59.216 --> 01:06:00.173
Well. by the looks of you.

480
01:06:00.304 --> 01:06:01.261
I'd just assume you're used to

481
01:06:01.392 --> 01:06:03.437
spending time in a prison cell.

482
01:06:03.568 --> 01:06:05.352
- Whoa. whoa. whoa.
- Hey.

483
01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:08.442
Hank. knock it off.

484
01:06:11.141 --> 01:06:13.360
Look. I get it.

485
01:06:13.491 --> 01:06:16.015
it's real tight quarters
and none of us want to be here.

486
01:06:16.146 --> 01:06:19.976
But we cannot start
playing the blame game
or turning on each other.

487
01:06:21.455 --> 01:06:23.675
We're all stuck in here.
But out there?

488
01:06:23.805 --> 01:06:26.069
That's where
the real fight is.

489
01:06:26.199 --> 01:06:28.854
So let's figure out
how to join it!

490
01:06:31.291 --> 01:06:32.901
You don't understand. man?

491
01:06:33.032 --> 01:06:34.991
There is no fight.

492
01:06:38.342 --> 01:06:39.691
We already lost.

493
01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:42.563
Now it's just...

494
01:06:44.957 --> 01:06:47.133
biding our time
until the end.

495
01:07:20.166 --> 01:07:21.428
Shit.

496
01:07:31.395 --> 01:07:33.440
No. come on.

497
01:07:41.622 --> 01:07:43.059
No!

498
01:08:02.252 --> 01:08:03.514
I'm sorry. Jack.

499
01:08:13.176 --> 01:08:14.220
I'm sorry.

500
01:08:34.893 --> 01:08:36.503
That's flying too low.

501
01:08:49.081 --> 01:08:50.126
It's landing.

502
01:09:06.011 --> 01:09:07.099
Come on.

503
01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:14.846
It's not over yet. buddy.

504
01:09:21.374 --> 01:09:24.072
We are on schedule.
As well. we've obtained

505
01:09:24.203 --> 01:09:27.859
all RAF identification codes
through our contacts in England.

506
01:09:27.989 --> 01:09:31.515
These codes will be crucial
in safely flying the aircraft
into--

507
01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:45.355
I see we have
recovered one pilot.

508
01:09:45.485 --> 01:09:47.052
What happened to your men?

509
01:09:47.183 --> 01:09:48.445
Did their plane crash. too?

510
01:09:49.924 --> 01:09:51.839
Sir. we were ambushed.

511
01:09:51.970 --> 01:09:55.495
Ambushed? By whom?

512
01:09:55.626 --> 01:09:57.367
An American pilot.

513
01:09:57.497 --> 01:10:01.458
I shot him down.
but he survived.

514
01:10:01.588 --> 01:10:03.808
And where is
this pilot now?

515
01:10:03.938 --> 01:10:05.897
We do not know. sir.

516
01:10:06.027 --> 01:10:10.293
The major's inability
to dispose of this American

517
01:10:10.423 --> 01:10:13.209
has cost der Fuhrer
many soldiers today.

518
01:10:15.254 --> 01:10:19.389
Der Fuhrer does not care
about soldiers like them.

519
01:10:21.042 --> 01:10:23.088
You should be
far more concerned with me.

520
01:10:25.656 --> 01:10:29.790
Major Roth. I will send for you
when you are needed.

521
01:10:29.921 --> 01:10:32.010
Captain Gruber.
please continue your briefing.

522
01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:36.580
The uniforms from the B-17
bomber crew should fool any RAF
scout planes.

523
01:10:36.710 --> 01:10:40.410
but we must explain
the missing P-51 fighters
to the Allied ground control.

524
01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:41.976
- I suggest we say--

525
01:10:44.501 --> 01:10:48.200
Major. have you decided
to add insubordination

526
01:10:48.331 --> 01:10:50.420
to your charge
of dereliction of duty?

527
01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:53.336
What?

528
01:10:53.466 --> 01:10:55.599
You were
placed on this assignment.

529
01:10:55.729 --> 01:10:57.862
along with
your arrogant brother.

530
01:10:57.992 --> 01:10:59.777
because you were the best.

531
01:11:02.997 --> 01:11:05.173
I knew your brother
was not up to this.

532
01:11:08.394 --> 01:11:10.396
I'm surprised
he did not kill you both.

533
01:11:11.571 --> 01:11:14.835
Sir. my brother died bravely--

534
01:11:14.966 --> 01:11:18.883
Your brother died a failure!

535
01:11:19.013 --> 01:11:22.060
Be thankful you do not
share his fate.

536
01:11:23.104 --> 01:11:24.671
Let me find the American.

537
01:11:24.802 --> 01:11:26.194
He is weak.

538
01:11:26.325 --> 01:11:29.023
You are the weak one. Major.

539
01:11:29.154 --> 01:11:30.198
You have caused enough--

540
01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:38.511
Major. tomorrow morning
you will be sent back to Berlin.

541
01:11:40.687 --> 01:11:42.820
You will receive
the Iron Cross

542
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:45.431
and retire quietly to serve
your Fuhrer in another way.

543
01:11:47.041 --> 01:11:50.218
Perhaps training
a new generation of pilots

544
01:11:50.349 --> 01:11:54.701
who someday might be as good
as you... once were.

545
01:11:57.965 --> 01:12:00.228
I do not want a medal.

546
01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:03.188
I want the American.

547
01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:07.714
So. give me the night.
I will find the pilot.

548
01:12:07.845 --> 01:12:10.674
And I will bring his head
back to Berlin as a trophy!

549
01:12:10.804 --> 01:12:11.805
- But my mission--

550
01:12:11.936 --> 01:12:15.331
Your mission was
"no survivors!"

551
01:12:16.897 --> 01:12:19.247
Kampfgeschwader 200
can only exist

552
01:12:19.378 --> 01:12:21.946
in complete secrecy.

553
01:12:26.211 --> 01:12:28.213
You are confined
to your quarters.

554
01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:31.172
I will not see you again.

555
01:12:45.578 --> 01:12:48.233
Captain. once again
finish your briefing.

556
01:12:50.104 --> 01:12:52.933
Sir. there is a concern
that the blast radius

557
01:12:53.064 --> 01:12:54.500
may overtake the aircraft.

558
01:12:54.631 --> 01:12:56.676
Captain.
keep your mind on the mission.

559
01:12:56.807 --> 01:12:59.766
Or your next mission
will be on the Russian Front!

560
01:13:20.744 --> 01:13:23.747
Careful. you fools!
Do you want to kill us all?

561
01:13:24.574 --> 01:13:26.663
Hurry now! Hurry!

562
01:13:26.793 --> 01:13:28.316
But gentle. gently...

563
01:13:28.447 --> 01:13:30.667
But Schnell! Schnell!

564
01:14:34.818 --> 01:14:36.428
What do they feed these guys?

565
01:14:40.388 --> 01:14:42.129
These Krauts have to feed us
sooner or later.

566
01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:44.001
- Yeah.
When they open that door--

567
01:14:56.666 --> 01:14:57.710
Hello.

568
01:15:01.453 --> 01:15:03.411
Do you remember us?

569
01:15:04.717 --> 01:15:06.893
Josef remembers you.

570
01:15:08.678 --> 01:15:12.638
Why don't you come show him
how sorry you are?

571
01:15:17.774 --> 01:15:21.168
Poor Josef. he cannot speak.

572
01:15:21.299 --> 01:15:24.476
but I know
that he likes you very much.

573
01:15:24.607 --> 01:15:26.217
Don't you like him?

574
01:15:27.174 --> 01:15:30.395
He is very handsome.

575
01:15:30.526 --> 01:15:33.093
- Hey. pal. back off!
- Finn.

576
01:15:35.356 --> 01:15:37.533
Should we give it another try?

577
01:15:43.713 --> 01:15:45.018
Go to hell!

578
01:15:47.325 --> 01:15:50.023
Your cooperation
would be very helpful.

579
01:15:50.284 --> 01:15:54.506
But make no mistake.
we do not need it.

580
01:15:57.291 --> 01:15:58.379
Oh. hell no!

581
01:16:00.904 --> 01:16:01.774
Back up!

582
01:16:06.474 --> 01:16:09.652
Not you.
Come here. sweet girl.

583
01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:14.613
Hey. you don't have to do this.

584
01:16:14.744 --> 01:16:16.484
Yeah. take it easy man!

585
01:16:16.615 --> 01:16:20.532
Put your schwarz dog on a leash
or I'll put him down myself.

586
01:16:20.663 --> 01:16:23.100
We are here
to take what is ours.

587
01:16:28.584 --> 01:16:29.497
Hey!

588
01:16:36.722 --> 01:16:38.071
No! No!

589
01:16:38.202 --> 01:16:40.204
Get your hands off her.
you filthy Kraut!

590
01:17:01.965 --> 01:17:04.576
You have made your last mistake.

591
01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:35.128
- Friend of yours?
- Yeah.

592
01:17:40.656 --> 01:17:43.267
- What's going on up there?

593
01:17:43.397 --> 01:17:45.922
- Holden. you're alive!
- Yeah don't act so surprised.
Finn.

594
01:17:46.052 --> 01:17:47.271
Here.

595
01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:53.146
- We need to move.
- OK. we go back out
the same way I came in. Alright?

596
01:17:53.277 --> 01:17:55.235
Hide out in the forest.
hit and run until they
send a rescue--

597
01:17:55.366 --> 01:17:58.195
There's no time.
Holden. they've got a bomb.

598
01:17:58.325 --> 01:18:00.980
- A wunderwaffe!
- A what?

599
01:18:01.111 --> 01:18:03.374
Super weapon.
It can take out an entire city.

600
01:18:06.116 --> 01:18:07.770
- London.
- What?

601
01:18:09.249 --> 01:18:10.642
I found their flight-plans.

602
01:18:10.773 --> 01:18:12.339
I think they're gonna
bomb London.

603
01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:14.428
The allies
won't know what hit 'em
until it's too late.

604
01:18:15.299 --> 01:18:17.170
Those bastards!

605
01:18:17.301 --> 01:18:20.043
They're using my plane
as a goddamn trojan horse!

606
01:18:22.045 --> 01:18:23.394
Report!

607
01:18:33.230 --> 01:18:34.579
We can't let them
get away with this.

608
01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:37.277
OK. look. we need to arm up.
Follow me.

609
01:18:38.626 --> 01:18:39.627
Who's this?

610
01:18:43.153 --> 01:18:44.067
I can help.

611
01:18:46.852 --> 01:18:48.158
Nice to meet you. Marie.

612
01:18:49.637 --> 01:18:50.813
You guys ready for this?

613
01:18:54.207 --> 01:18:55.339
Follow me.

614
01:19:31.984 --> 01:19:33.246
Follow me!

615
01:19:41.211 --> 01:19:44.562
OK. you two.
Thompson and Armstrong.
give us cover fire.

616
01:19:44.692 --> 01:19:47.434
We're gonna make it down
to the first floor.
toward the Yankee Lady.

617
01:19:51.177 --> 01:19:52.483
No matter what happens...

618
01:19:54.528 --> 01:19:56.052
we do not let her fly.

619
01:21:46.597 --> 01:21:49.295
Thompson.
that's where they took Harry.

620
01:21:49.426 --> 01:21:51.210
You think
he's still up there?

621
01:21:51.341 --> 01:21:53.386
If he is.
we can't just leave him.

622
01:21:53.517 --> 01:21:55.823
We'll cover you
if you think you can make it.

623
01:21:59.305 --> 01:22:00.741
I can do this.

624
01:22:02.091 --> 01:22:03.701
Just don't stop firing.

625
01:22:09.489 --> 01:22:10.534
Go!

626
01:23:03.195 --> 01:23:04.457
Coward.

627
01:23:21.822 --> 01:23:23.650
Auf wiedersehen.
you son of a bitch!

628
01:23:34.966 --> 01:23:36.707
I'm getting you
the hell out of here. Friedman.

629
01:23:36.837 --> 01:23:38.013
Armstrong...

630
01:23:39.710 --> 01:23:42.017
it had to be you.

631
01:23:42.147 --> 01:23:43.931
Now I'm never gonna
live this down.

632
01:23:44.062 --> 01:23:46.282
Jesus. what the hell
did they do to your hand?

633
01:23:46.412 --> 01:23:48.284
Nazi bastards.

634
01:23:55.987 --> 01:23:59.251
Come on. come on!
OK. get up! Come on. come on!

635
01:23:59.382 --> 01:24:01.123
Here we go. Come on. buddy.

636
01:24:01.253 --> 01:24:04.517
Come on. stay with me!
Stay with me! Come on!

637
01:24:08.782 --> 01:24:12.134
Move it. soldier!
Grab the rail. grab the rail!

638
01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:39.900
I can't make it!
I can't make it!

639
01:24:40.031 --> 01:24:41.859
Look at me! Move!

640
01:25:14.848 --> 01:25:17.242
- No!

641
01:25:41.962 --> 01:25:45.531
Thompson. get our boys home.

642
01:25:50.145 --> 01:25:51.320
Go! Come on. Hank.

643
01:25:51.450 --> 01:25:53.148
Hank. no. no.

644
01:25:53.278 --> 01:25:55.411
Come on. Hank. Come on!

645
01:25:59.458 --> 01:26:01.634
- I'm so sorry.
- No. no. no. no!

646
01:26:01.765 --> 01:26:03.854
No. no. no. no. Armstrong.
come on. buddy!

647
01:26:03.984 --> 01:26:06.857
Come on. talk to me!
Look at me. buddy. come on!

648
01:26:06.987 --> 01:26:09.990
Come on!
Come on. you're there. buddy.
Talk to me!

649
01:26:11.209 --> 01:26:13.690
We'll come back!

650
01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:16.997
He's gone.
He's gone!

651
01:26:17.128 --> 01:26:19.870
We need to make sure that
the Yankee Lady stays grounded.

652
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.133
Just give me a fucking gun.

653
01:26:22.264 --> 01:26:25.223
Holden. you stop
the Yankee Lady from taking off.

654
01:26:25.354 --> 01:26:27.791
- We'll cover you!
- Alright.

655
01:26:31.621 --> 01:26:33.405
Do not let that bomber
off the ground!

656
01:26:35.755 --> 01:26:37.017
Go!

657
01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:32.785
Let's go!

658
01:28:36.093 --> 01:28:37.312
Home free!

659
01:28:43.622 --> 01:28:44.797
No.

660
01:28:45.972 --> 01:28:47.191
No.

661
01:29:00.770 --> 01:29:01.988
No.

662
01:29:09.692 --> 01:29:10.910
It is time.

663
01:29:23.619 --> 01:29:25.534
Move. move. move!

664
01:30:05.487 --> 01:30:09.099
Well done. I am impressed.

665
01:30:09.229 --> 01:30:12.537
We're just getting started!

666
01:30:12.668 --> 01:30:15.018
I'm afraid not.

667
01:30:15.148 --> 01:30:21.590
I do not know how you escaped.
but. as you can see. it is over.

668
01:30:22.504 --> 01:30:24.244
You have lost.

669
01:30:24.375 --> 01:30:26.899
Oh. man.
this does not look good.
What are we gonna do?

670
01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:29.380
I am sorry.
but I cannot allow you

671
01:30:29.511 --> 01:30:31.774
to reach your bomber.
my friends.

672
01:30:32.775 --> 01:30:36.431
But if you come quietly...

673
01:30:42.045 --> 01:30:45.483
I will show you mercy.

674
01:30:48.399 --> 01:30:49.574
Throw down your weapons.

675
01:30:51.707 --> 01:30:52.708
Now.

676
01:30:54.013 --> 01:30:55.493
I won't go back.

677
01:30:56.668 --> 01:30:58.148
I won't go back!

678
01:30:59.366 --> 01:31:01.020
I won't go back!

679
01:31:01.151 --> 01:31:02.718
Wait!

680
01:31:08.724 --> 01:31:09.855
Fire!

681
01:32:09.698 --> 01:32:11.482
No survivors.

682
01:32:55.570 --> 01:32:58.921
When that .42 stops to reload.
unleash hell.

683
01:33:00.792 --> 01:33:02.620
Thompson. don't do this.

684
01:33:02.751 --> 01:33:04.100
You're outta your goddamn mind!
I'm going with you!

685
01:33:04.230 --> 01:33:06.015
The hell you are!

686
01:33:12.064 --> 01:33:13.718
The barrels.

687
01:33:13.849 --> 01:33:15.764
- What?
- Aim for the barrels!

688
01:33:15.894 --> 01:33:18.636
- What the hell
are you talking about?
- Shoot the bloody barrels!

689
01:33:34.609 --> 01:33:36.480
Goddamn!

690
01:33:37.786 --> 01:33:39.091
Oh. we're going home today!

691
01:35:26.155 --> 01:35:27.547
I'm bringing us home.

692
01:36:07.631 --> 01:36:08.980
No.

693
01:36:09.111 --> 01:36:11.461
No. no. no! Shit!

694
01:36:16.161 --> 01:36:17.075
No...

695
01:36:39.619 --> 01:36:40.838
Oh. shit.

696
01:36:40.969 --> 01:36:42.448
Shit.
there's gotta be something.

697
01:36:43.536 --> 01:36:45.277
What the hell is that thing?

698
01:36:46.713 --> 01:36:49.542
OK. that I can work with.

699
01:36:53.372 --> 01:36:54.809
Oh. my God!

700
01:36:58.247 --> 01:37:00.162
Thompson!

701
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:25.752
This ain't over yet.

702
01:37:30.366 --> 01:37:32.716
Jesus. Cap!

703
01:37:32.847 --> 01:37:35.458
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine! I'm fine!

704
01:37:39.375 --> 01:37:40.463
Light em up!

705
01:37:40.593 --> 01:37:41.899
Oh. hell yeah.

706
01:38:09.144 --> 01:38:10.493
Give me this!

707
01:38:10.623 --> 01:38:11.886
Hurry up!

708
01:38:13.539 --> 01:38:14.540
Locked and loaded.

709
01:38:16.891 --> 01:38:19.415
This is how
we do it in Brooklyn!

710
01:38:37.607 --> 01:38:39.826
OK. here we go.

711
01:38:59.107 --> 01:39:01.152
Hey. Thompson.
we got any more of these?

712
01:39:02.414 --> 01:39:03.850
We've got one shot.

713
01:39:05.330 --> 01:39:07.942
They're out of ammunition!

714
01:39:21.956 --> 01:39:23.131
Oh. shit!

715
01:39:28.658 --> 01:39:31.269
Oh. this is gonna be good!

716
01:40:11.396 --> 01:40:13.224
<i>Sieg heil.</i>mother--

717
01:41:13.545 --> 01:41:16.331
What have you done?!

718
01:41:16.461 --> 01:41:18.985
You have ruined everything!

719
01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:24.513
I will tear you apart!

720
01:41:24.643 --> 01:41:26.384
You are nothing!

721
01:41:26.515 --> 01:41:28.473
And you are weak!

722
01:41:33.696 --> 01:41:35.132
You cannot win.

723
01:41:36.612 --> 01:41:41.095
I win... I win!

724
01:41:44.141 --> 01:41:45.273
Hey. pal...

725
01:41:45.403 --> 01:41:47.840
Nein!

726
01:41:47.971 --> 01:41:49.494
You talk too much.

727
01:42:13.779 --> 01:42:16.130
Come on. come on.
let's get the hell out of here!

728
01:42:41.764 --> 01:42:43.113
Go get 'em. Holden.

729
01:43:04.047 --> 01:43:05.483
My beauty.

730
01:43:10.184 --> 01:43:12.186
So beautiful.

731
01:43:33.207 --> 01:43:35.426
Well. I was tired
of escort missions.

732
01:43:47.612 --> 01:43:49.440
Sir. I think we have a problem.

733
01:43:49.571 --> 01:43:51.399
What is it?!

734
01:43:51.529 --> 01:43:54.793
<i>B-17 Wolf Hound</i>
<i>calling B-25 Wild Cargo.</i>

735
01:43:54.924 --> 01:43:58.057
<i>identify yourself immediately</i>
<i>or you will be fired upon.</i>

736
01:43:58.188 --> 01:44:01.017
<i>- I repeat. identif--</i>
- That's enough of that.

737
01:44:03.019 --> 01:44:05.195
All turrets. open fire!

738
01:44:20.689 --> 01:44:24.954
I said keep this steady!
Do you want to kill us all now?

739
01:44:27.696 --> 01:44:29.001
Back where I belong.

740
01:44:49.195 --> 01:44:50.501
Come on...

741
01:45:00.294 --> 01:45:01.425
What the--?

742
01:45:27.364 --> 01:45:29.540
We have reinforcements. sir.

743
01:45:29.671 --> 01:45:32.674
- It's Roth.
- Tell him
to finish his mission.

744
01:46:00.702 --> 01:46:03.531
Shh... quiet.

745
01:46:04.575 --> 01:46:06.621
You'll get to make noise soon.

746
01:46:07.839 --> 01:46:09.972
That fat man Churchill

747
01:46:10.102 --> 01:46:11.495
will never know what hit him.

748
01:46:31.689 --> 01:46:35.824
OK. just a little scratch.
Don't worry.

749
01:46:44.572 --> 01:46:46.400
Ouch...

750
01:46:46.530 --> 01:46:48.837
OK. maybe we should
worry a little bit.

751
01:46:58.324 --> 01:46:59.413
Come on!

752
01:47:11.076 --> 01:47:12.469
Where are you??

753
01:47:16.255 --> 01:47:17.431
Shit.

754
01:47:24.394 --> 01:47:25.874
What the hell is he doing?

755
01:47:32.358 --> 01:47:34.491
Holy shit.

756
01:47:34.622 --> 01:47:36.798
Oh. he's taking me apart
one piece at a time.

757
01:47:44.849 --> 01:47:45.850
Shit!

758
01:47:54.511 --> 01:47:55.773
This ends now.

759
01:48:57.443 --> 01:48:58.967
Catch this. you son of a bitch.

760
01:49:25.646 --> 01:49:26.734
Come on! Come on!

761
01:49:52.020 --> 01:49:53.108
Holy shit.

762
01:49:54.718 --> 01:49:56.459
Holy shit!

763
01:50:00.681 --> 01:50:01.899
Come on!

764
01:50:23.181 --> 01:50:24.705
Whoo!

765
01:51:48.310 --> 01:51:50.007
No survivors.

766
01:52:19.254 --> 01:52:20.908
That one was for you. Jack.

767
01:52:41.624 --> 01:52:43.713
We are coming within range. sir.

768
01:52:45.019 --> 01:52:46.585
Excellent.

769
01:52:55.072 --> 01:52:59.076
Alright... let's finish this.

770
01:53:14.788 --> 01:53:16.093
<i>This is Allied Command.</i>

771
01:53:16.224 --> 01:53:18.313

<i>identify yourselves</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

773
01:53:20.837 --> 01:53:23.057
Boy. we're sure glad
to hear you.

774
01:53:23.187 --> 01:53:27.017
This is Captain Thompson
with the Yankee Lady
requesting permission to land.

775
01:53:27.148 --> 01:53:30.499
We've taken heavy damage
and are in need of repair. over.

776
01:53:30.629 --> 01:53:33.937
<i>Roger. Yankee Lady.</i>
<i>Maintain current approach.</i>

777
01:53:34.068 --> 01:53:36.984
<i>Emergency ground crews</i>
<i>will be standing by. over.</i>

778
01:53:37.114 --> 01:53:38.899
Too easy.

779
01:53:50.998 --> 01:53:53.304
<i>Approaching the drop zone</i>
<i>now. sir.</i>

780
01:53:53.435 --> 01:53:55.480
<i>Time to target: four minutes.</i>

781
01:54:12.758 --> 01:54:13.847
What?

782
01:54:17.589 --> 01:54:19.200
No!

783
01:54:19.330 --> 01:54:21.898
Come on! Come on!

784
01:54:22.029 --> 01:54:24.292
I'm out of bullets.

785
01:54:24.422 --> 01:54:27.599
- No! No! No. no. no!

786
01:54:56.063 --> 01:54:57.064
No.

787
01:55:07.248 --> 01:55:08.466
No.

788
01:55:22.350 --> 01:55:25.222
The 1.000-year Reich
is almost complete.

789
01:55:30.488 --> 01:55:33.448
Arming sequence initiated.
Colonel Krieger!

790
01:56:01.606 --> 01:56:03.782
Looks like I'm not
making it home.

791
01:56:15.185 --> 01:56:16.621
<i>Trust me. kid.</i>

792
01:56:16.752 --> 01:56:19.146
<i>one man can make</i>
<i>an impact on this war.</i>

793
01:56:20.495 --> 01:56:22.062
Just maybe not
the way you think.

794
01:56:44.649 --> 01:56:45.868
This is it.

795
01:57:00.361 --> 01:57:01.797
"Not the way I think."

796
01:57:14.679 --> 01:57:16.594
God. I hope this works.

797
01:57:52.978 --> 01:57:54.719
For der Fuhrer.

798
01:57:56.243 --> 01:57:58.593
For Deutschland.

799
01:58:20.223 --> 01:58:21.529
Oh. my God.

800
01:58:28.231 --> 01:58:30.625
Oh. my God.
I can't believe that worked!

804
01:58:51.124 --> 01:58:53.126
Yes! Yes. Allied Command!

805
01:58:53.256 --> 01:58:54.910
This is Captain David Holden.

806
01:58:55.040 --> 01:58:58.174
My P-51 was shot down.

807
01:58:58.305 --> 01:59:00.611
I'm coming in hot
in a recovered B-25.

808
01:59:01.873 --> 01:59:04.224
Requesting permission to land.

809
01:59:04.354 --> 01:59:06.139
<i>Welcome back. Captain Holden.</i>

810
01:59:06.269 --> 01:59:10.186
<i>You and Captain Reynolds</i>
<i>are long overdue.</i>

811
01:59:10.317 --> 01:59:12.493

Let's go home.

815
02:00:25.827 --> 02:00:27.568
Excuse me. ma'am.

816
02:00:27.698 --> 02:00:29.831
Uh. you wouldn't happen to be
Miss Katherine?

817
02:00:29.961 --> 02:00:31.963
Yes. I am.

818
02:00:34.966 --> 02:00:37.926
Is this about my fiancé?

819
02:00:38.056 --> 02:00:39.710
Men already came
a couple months back. and I--

820
02:00:39.841 --> 02:00:41.582
Yes. this is about Jack.

821
02:00:48.371 --> 02:00:50.417
My name is Captain David Holden.

822
02:00:52.114 --> 02:00:53.507
Jack was my wingman.

823
02:00:56.336 --> 02:00:57.250
I. uh...

824
02:01:03.386 --> 02:01:04.605
I brought something for you.

825
02:01:15.180 --> 02:01:17.705
Please. where are my manners?
Come in.

826
02:01:17.835 --> 02:01:19.359
Uh. no. I really--

827
02:01:19.489 --> 02:01:21.970
I don't mean to bother you.
ma'am. and I can't stay long.

828
02:01:26.844 --> 02:01:28.019
I always knew.

829
02:01:31.066 --> 02:01:32.894
I knew he wasn't coming home.

830
02:01:36.593 --> 02:01:40.771
I begged him to stay.
but he wouldn't listen.

831
02:01:42.686 --> 02:01:45.602
Jack had his ways.

832
02:01:45.733 --> 02:01:47.865
When he made up
his mind about something...

833
02:01:49.563 --> 02:01:52.261
Believe me. I know.

834
02:01:55.743 --> 02:01:58.746
In fact. Jack's the reason
why I had that compass
to begin with.

835
02:01:58.876 --> 02:02:00.051
What do you mean?

836
02:02:02.706 --> 02:02:04.012
I told Jack...

837
02:02:06.449 --> 02:02:08.799
that I was worried that we were
never gonna make it back.

838
02:02:13.369 --> 02:02:15.066
And he said that he
had a lucky charm.

839
02:02:17.678 --> 02:02:19.636
And he snuck that
in my bag one morning.

840
02:02:20.855 --> 02:02:22.291
He wouldn't take it back.

841
02:02:24.598 --> 02:02:26.121
And it wasn't until...

842
02:02:27.775 --> 02:02:29.254
Well. until after...

843
02:02:30.255 --> 02:02:32.649
that I found the photo.

844
02:02:39.743 --> 02:02:42.180
He said that one day
it might save my life.

845
02:02:44.705 --> 02:02:45.967
Well. it didn't.

846
02:02:51.015 --> 02:02:52.713
But Captain Reynolds did.

847
02:02:59.110 --> 02:03:00.242
And. uh--

848
02:03:00.373 --> 02:03:01.591
Anyway. I just thought that...

849
02:03:05.378 --> 02:03:06.814
he wanted it to be here.

850
02:03:07.945 --> 02:03:09.077
With you.

851
02:03:14.822 --> 02:03:16.563
I should be on my way now.

852
02:03:17.738 --> 02:03:18.695
Ma'am.

853
02:03:22.220 --> 02:03:23.352
Thank you.

854
02:03:27.530 --> 02:03:29.837
Thank you for bringing him
back to me.

855
02:03:32.622 --> 02:03:33.754
You're welcome.
