- Yeah. you are.

75
00:06:17.834 --> 00:06:20.840
Technically. I have over
100 different bosses

76
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.340
in this building.

77
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.210
- But only the miserly
landlord. Harris. pays you.

78
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.740
Therefore. you only have one boss.

79
00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.080
- Miserly.

80
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.909
Penny pincher. tightwad. cheapskate.

81
00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:33.743

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.813
Just a small leak. but I fixed it for you.

No. not again. I'll get fired.

86
00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.430
- You're not gonna get fired.

87
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.310
I have enough dirt on Harris
that you're safe forever.

88
00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:00.110
- If he finds out. he'll get
so angry. He's vindictive.

89
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.163
- Unforgiving. vengeful?

90
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.390
Suit yourself.

91
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:09.313
I'll just return it then.

92
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.790

93
00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.123

Holographic graphics.

96
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.013
According to my collector's
manual. this one's rare.

97
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.330
Do you want me to put
the bug in the air vent?

98
00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.430

Only how they sound.

I put my other lunchboxes.

105
00:07:54.873 --> 00:07:56.783
- Okay. you know I can't leave this room.

106
00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.970
- Because of what's wrong with you?

107
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.100
- Thanks for the sink.

108
00:08:07.891 --> 00:08:11.058

113
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.567

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.092
- [Gordon] You're right.
Someone needs to go talk to her.

120
00:09:10.092 --> 00:09:11.730

123
00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:19.040
- Gordon. you're the only one
with the balls for the job.

124
00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.593
Expect Manny to do it?

125
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.850
When's the last time he
did anything worthwhile?

126
00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:26.135
- [Christine] Things are
different between us.

127
00:09:26.135 --> 00:09:27.930
- [Scott] Why do we keep going over this?

128
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:29.717
- [Christine] Can we just talk about this?

129
00:09:29.717 --> 00:09:30.550
- [Scott] There's this thing at work.

130
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:32.321
I'm under a lotta stress.

131
00:09:32.321 --> 00:09:33.515
- [Christine] You're being so distant.

132
00:09:33.515 --> 00:09:34.348
- [Scott] If you can't trust me.

133
00:09:34.348 --> 00:09:36.670
that's you sabotaging our relationship.

134
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:38.573
- Wow. don't let him do that.

135
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.396
Don't apologize. He's cheating
on you. and you know it.

136
00:09:42.396 --> 00:09:43.447
- [Christine] Please--

137
00:09:43.447 --> 00:09:45.025
(knocking on door)

138
00:09:45.025 --> 00:09:46.725
- [Scott] Maybe I should just go.

139
00:09:47.726 --> 00:09:50.309
(upbeat piano music)

140
00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.896

141
00:09:54.896 --> 00:09:55.729
- Interrupt what?

142
00:09:55.729 --> 00:09:57.923
- Oh. it sounded like you had company.

143
00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.547
Anyway. do you have any
ice? My fridge is out.

144
00:10:06.976 --> 00:10:09.559
(door closing)

145
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:16.140
- You should have Leonard
check that out for you.

146
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.133
- Check what out?

147
00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.390

148
00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:21.543

00:10:38.415 --> 00:10:42.415
(muffled shouting through wall)

152
00:10:50.816 --> 00:10:53.983
(soft dramatic music)

153
00:10:57.096 --> 00:10:58.929
- [Shawn] Fucking bitch!

154
00:11:00.181 --> 00:11:02.138
Where did you put my fucking money?

155
00:11:02.138 --> 00:11:04.888
Why do you have to act like this?

156
00:11:07.392 --> 00:11:11.392
(muffled shouting through wall)

157
00:11:12.761 --> 00:11:15.633
You are worthless! You are nothing!

158
00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:19.550
(upbeat classical piano music)

159
00:11:28.135 --> 00:11:31.216
(soft dramatic music)

160
00:11:31.216 --> 00:11:33.490

161
00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:35.990
(piano music)

162
00:11:42.211 --> 00:11:44.961
(piano breaking)

163
00:11:58.847 --> 00:12:02.680
(singing in foreign language)

164
00:12:51.258 --> 00:12:54.258
(doorknob jiggling)

165
00:13:05.271 --> 00:13:07.650
- Huh. I love what
you've done to the place.

166
00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:08.660
Did you get my message?

167
00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:11.563
- Yeah. something. something closure.

168
00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.790
- Uh. this is. uh--

169
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:16.270
- Sh.

170
00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:19.053
- This is yours. Marie
wanted you to have it.

171
00:13:26.393 --> 00:13:27.823
Do you wanna see what it is?

172
00:13:27.823 --> 00:13:31.801
- Don't touch that. okay.
Everything has its place.

173
00:13:31.801 --> 00:13:32.634
Okay.

174
00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.290
- You know. Marie got sick a year ago.

175
00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:41.480
Four months ago. she
went into the hospital.

176
00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.730
Eight weeks ago. I put her in the ground.

177
00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:44.863
Where the hell were you?

178
00:13:44.863 --> 00:13:46.440
- I can't do this right now.

179
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.620
- All that progress and
you just threw it away

180
00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.243
when she needed you the most.

181
00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.010
I must have been a fool. you know.

182
00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:55.233
to think that maybe you loved her.

183
00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.290
Wait wait wait. let me guess.

184
00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:01.100
Because of your retrograde amnesia.

185
00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:04.123
you couldn't remember whether
you gave a damn or not.

186
00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:06.410
You know what?

187
00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:10.363
Now that she's gone. me and
you. we're done. for good.

188
00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:13.173
- Alan?

189
00:14:18.235 --> 00:14:20.280
One of my neighbors. she plays the piano.

190
00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.940
She practices every
afternoon from four to six.

191
00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.780
except weekends and Saturdays.

192
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.330
she'll play once in the
morning after breakfast

193
00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:28.580
and once at night around six.

194
00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:29.413
Sunday. she plays--

195
00:14:29.413 --> 00:14:30.850
- What do you want?

196
00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:32.000
- Someone destroyed it.

197
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:35.800
The piano. late last night.

198
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.710
I just need you to go knock on
her door. see if she answers.

199
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:42.130
And that's all. It's Room 607.

200
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:44.330
- You're really worried
about your neighbor?

201
00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.130
- By this time today. she'd
have practiced already.

202
00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:51.580
She'd be out of the shower.
blow-drying her hair.

203
00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.380
- How do you know that?

204
00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:55.250
You know what? Call the cops.

205
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:56.083
- No.

206
00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.240
- Well. great. do it yourself. kid.

207
00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.980
- I'd have to leave this
room. I can't do that.

208
00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.380
- Whew. bye-bye.

209
00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:03.430
- There's more. okay.

210
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.253
Whoever destroyed it. left this playing.

211
00:15:09.462 --> 00:15:10.990
(operatic singing in foreign language)

212
00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:15.990
Alan. when I heard it. I saw something.

213
00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:20.340
But I didn't just see it. I remembered it.

214
00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:21.393
It was a memory.

215
00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:25.213
I think it was from before
that day Marie found me.

216
00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:29.122
Okay. I need you to go over there.

217
00:15:29.122 --> 00:15:31.343
I just need you to see
what the hell's going on.

218
00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:35.857
- I will not enable you like she did.

219
00:15:37.627 --> 00:15:39.630
And don't expect any more gigs from me.

220
00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:41.520
because from now on I'm using Paul.

221
00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:42.870
- That hack!

222
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:43.703
- What?

223
00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:47.360
- Fine. fine. Use Paul. I don't care.

224
00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.963
But that music.

225
00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.073
I saw this door.

226
00:15:53.284 --> 00:15:54.330
- Are you still taking your meds?

227
00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.250
- Someone knew I'd be
listening. I know it.

228
00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:59.470
- I said. are you still taking your meds?

229
00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:00.303
- What?

230
00:16:00.303 --> 00:16:01.571
- Not what. Answer me. are
you still taking your meds?

231
00:16:01.571 --> 00:16:02.988
- Yes. yes. I am!

232
00:16:03.913 --> 00:16:08.496
(operatic singing in foreign language)

233
00:16:15.067 --> 00:16:18.515
- Hey hey hey. is this what I think it is?

234
00:16:18.515 --> 00:16:20.060
(soft dramatic music)

235
00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.763
These are apartment numbers.

236
00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.043
You've been taping your neighbors'
apartments. haven't you?

237
00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:30.930
Just to feed that sick fetish of yours.

238
00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:32.760
That's how you know what
the hell they're up to.

239
00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.800
- They may not be relationships to you.

240
00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.863
but to me. they are my family.

241
00:16:38.963 --> 00:16:39.820
- Huh.

242
00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.100
Wow. hey I'm really happy

243
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.310
that you're surrounded by your family.

244
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:46.840
while the woman who devoted
her goddam life to you

245
00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.910
wasted away and died!

246
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:50.840
Hey. news flash. kid.

247
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.350
They're not your family.

248
00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:54.890
They don't know who you
are. and they don't care.

249
00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:56.490
- Okay. okay. thanks for stopping by. Dad.

250
00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:59.913
- I'm not your dad. and
Marie was not your mother.

251
00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.720
As much as she tried to be
when she brought you home.

252
00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:06.140
She did everything to help you.

253
00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:10.060
including sacrificing us.

254
00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:14.343
(operatic singing in foreign language)

255
00:17:14.343 --> 00:17:15.403
You know what?

256
00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:19.623
You belong in a psych ward.
just like your real mother.

257
00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.454
Don't call me.

258
00:17:22.454 --> 00:17:27.038
(operatic signing in foreign language)

259
00:17:30.468 --> 00:17:33.540
- [Ella] Incoming call from John.

260
00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:34.600
- Answer.

261
00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:35.690
- [John] Hello.

262
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:36.523
- I'm here.

263
00:17:36.523 --> 00:17:38.360
- [John] Did you get yesterday's message?

264
00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.750
Our editor needs the tuning
fork sound effects right away.

265
00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:43.470
It's a product video. We
can't go canned on it.

266
00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:45.670
- You moved up the
deadline. There's a queue.

267
00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:49.549
- [John] I'm prepared to pay
triple. Are you onboard or not?

268
00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:50.983
- Yeah. yeah. I'm onboard.

269
00:17:58.728 --> 00:18:01.702
(soft dramatic music)

270
00:18:01.702 --> 00:18:04.285
(fork humming)

271
00:18:08.286 --> 00:18:11.453
(soft dramatic music)

272
00:18:14.013 --> 00:18:16.094
- [Maggie] Hey.

273
00:18:16.094 --> 00:18:18.844
(dramatic music)

274
00:18:23.062 --> 00:18:25.812
(hard breathing)

275
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.730
- [Winters] Ella. call John.

276
00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:30.566
- [Ella] Calling John.

277
00:18:30.566 --> 00:18:31.400
(phone ringing)

278
00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.370
- [John] Hello.

279
00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:35.286
- Your client with the
tuning forks. who is it?

280
00:18:35.286 --> 00:18:37.313
- [John] I'm sorry. but once again?

281
00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.210
- Who are we making the recordings for?

282
00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:41.823
Who hired you to make the video?

283
00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:47.230
I don't even see a brand on this product.

284
00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:49.030
What kind of tuning forks are these?

285
00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.253
Is this a real gig?

286
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:56.863
Who hired you to call me?

287
00:18:57.864 --> 00:18:59.531
- [Ella] Call ended.

288
00:19:09.442 --> 00:19:12.359
(knocking on door)

289
00:19:15.929 --> 00:19:19.090
- I haven't gone into
102 yet. I was waiting--

290
00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:19.923
- The piano player in 607.

291
00:19:19.923 --> 00:19:22.230
have you seen her since yesterday?

292
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:24.752
- No. I haven't seen her in over a month.

293
00:19:24.752 --> 00:19:25.620
- A month?

294
00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:28.830
- Yeah. her window was stuck.
so I stuck in my putty knife.

295
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:29.740
and then with my hammer I--

296
00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:31.050
- Something's wrong.

297
00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:33.520
I didn't wanna ask you. but
you have to go check on her.

298
00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.420
Okay. you have to see
if something happened.

299
00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:38.230
- Whoa. um. is she sick?

300
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:40.709
Because like Dr. Lee. in 702. maybe he--

301
00:19:40.709 --> 00:19:42.663
- No. she's not sick. She's ...

302
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:46.313
I heard that ...

303
00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:48.163
There's this ...

304
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:54.993
I'm sending you on a mission.

305
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:58.600
I'm sending you on a mission.

306
00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.570
I'm the boss. okay. the sergeant.

307
00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:05.780
and you. you're the soldier
carrying out the mission.

308
00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:07.533
- You're not making any sense.

309
00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.947
- [Winters] Testing. can you hear me?

310
00:20:19.947 --> 00:20:22.050
Testing.

311
00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:23.380
- Hello. hello.

312
00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:25.490
- Private. this is a recon mission. okay.

313
00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:28.010
You're gonna go to Room
607. and you are gonna

314
00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:29.600
report back to me what you see

315
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.200
through this. do you understand?

316
00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:33.133
Go.

317
00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:36.196
Where are you right now?

318
00:20:36.196 --> 00:20:39.103
- [Leonard] Okay. I'm here. Room 607.

319
00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:41.510
- Is there anything out of the ordinary?

320
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:42.910
Do you see anybody?

321
00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:46.493
- [Leonard] I don't see
anybody. It kinda smells funny.

322
00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.203
It's unlocked. Should I go in?

323
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.557
Hello. should I go in?

324
00:20:54.557 --> 00:20:56.913
- Yeah. slowly. don't touch anything.

325
00:20:57.843 --> 00:21:00.690
(door creaking)

326
00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:02.390
- [Leonard] It smells bad in here.

327
00:21:03.873 --> 00:21:05.033
- What do you see?

328
00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:11.310
- [Leonard] It's dark. The
light switch doesn't work.

329
00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:12.860
- Use your flashlight. Leonard.

330
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:16.353
- [Leonard] I'm scared.

331
00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.693
- That's an order. Private.

332
00:21:20.599 --> 00:21:22.120
- [Leonard] Okay.

333
00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.270
- Tell me what you see.

334
00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.113
- [Leonard] There's plastic everywhere.

335
00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.066
- Plastic?

336
00:21:30.066 --> 00:21:33.050
(dramatic music)

337
00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:36.840
Get out. Leonard. Leonard.
Leonard. get out of there now!

338
00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.840
- [Leonard] Oh my God. Pieces!

339
00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.387
- The piano. the piano's in pieces?

340
00:21:41.387 --> 00:21:45.387
- Blood. there's blood (cries).

341
00:21:47.659 --> 00:21:49.826
I am in trouble. aren't I?

342
00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.553
- No. I am.

343
00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:56.600
Whoever killed her knows me.

344
00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.940
That music sparked my
memory. and the tuning forks.

345
00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.430
they caused a vision of a little girl.

346
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:04.630
But I don't know why.

347
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:07.713
If you see anything that doesn't belong.

348
00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:14.720
if you see anything that
seems weird to you at all.

349
00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.270
you come right back here to me.

350
00:22:17.879 --> 00:22:20.629
(hard breathing)

351
00:22:21.915 --> 00:22:24.915
(crickets chirping)

352
00:22:27.441 --> 00:22:29.691
(laughing)

353
00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:32.279
- That's funny.

354
00:22:32.279 --> 00:22:35.029
(laughing on TV)

355
00:22:36.836 --> 00:22:39.169
(chuckling)

356
00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:44.860
Hm?

357
00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.763
- Turn that down.

358
00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:49.640
- The TV?
- Mm-hm.

359

363
00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.120

364
00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:03.393
- Ask you. because you
have to be on board.

365
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:05.810
- Have to be on board what?

366
00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.180
- You know the little boy that I

367
00:23:10.488 --> 00:23:11.522

368
00:23:11.522 --> 00:23:13.522
- Yeah. the nut. the
nut. Yeah. the crazy kid.

369
00:23:13.522 --> 00:23:14.355
- Don't call him a nut.

370
00:23:14.355 --> 00:23:15.188
- I'm sorry.

371
00:23:15.188 --> 00:23:16.021
- He's not a nut.

372
00:23:16.021 --> 00:23:16.854

376
00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.625
- What's your point? Where are we going?

377
00:23:22.625 --> 00:23:24.110
Where are we going with this?

378
00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:29.110
- So I've been visiting him
at the hospital. every day.

379
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:31.963
And now he's in a facility.

380
00:23:33.987 --> 00:23:35.130

going with this. Marie?

381
00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:35.963

385
00:23:39.418 --> 00:23:40.910
- He's a ward of the state.

386
00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:45.910
And they said that they can
fast-track this adoption.

387
00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:47.606
and I want--

388
00:23:47.606 --> 00:23:49.740

389
00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:51.330
Please stop. please stop.

390
00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:53.050
If you need it. we can get a puppy.

391
00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:55.140
Okay. you want a puppy. we get a puppy.

392
00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.313
I don't need a kid coming into this house.

393
00:23:56.313 --> 00:23:59.910
- Alan. please. I. I can't even explain.

394
00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:01.423
I know I'm ...

395
00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:04.220
I love this boy. I love him.

396
00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:05.577
I can't explain it any other way.

397
00:24:05.577 --> 00:24:07.027
- I'm not good enough.
we need. we need a--

398
00:24:07.027 --> 00:24:11.670
- Just. I bonded with this
kid. He responds to me.

399
00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:13.130
He doesn't have anyone.

400
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:14.195
Not a person. no one.

401
00:24:14.195 --> 00:24:15.987
- So what do you wanna do?

402
00:24:15.987 --> 00:24:18.180
- No one has shown up.
- What do you wanna do?

403
00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:19.013
- Tell me.

404
00:24:19.013 --> 00:24:21.330
- I wanna go through with the adoption.

405
00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:24.000
I wanna. there's a few papers left.

406
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.610
I've already basically talked to everyone

407
00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:27.690
that I can talk to.

408
00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:32.140
And. the process has already begun. so--

409
00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:35.959
- You know what. let's talk
about this in the morning. okay?

410
00:24:35.959 --> 00:24:38.360
- Please. please. please.

411
00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.639
I've never wanted anything more.

412
00:24:40.639 --> 00:24:42.567
I mean. besides you (chuckles).

413
00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:46.663
He needs a loving home.

414
00:24:52.445 --> 00:24:54.610
(soft dramatic music)

415
00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:55.887
- Jesus.

416
00:24:55.887 --> 00:24:59.054
(soft dramatic music)

417
00:25:01.427 --> 00:25:02.260
- Sh. Sh.

418
00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:05.043
Just breathe.

419
00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:07.093
Just breathe.

420
00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:08.853
It's okay.

421
00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:10.973
Here.

422
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:14.113
Forget about the outside.

423
00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.703
Feel the shell. Feel it.

424
00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:20.523
Focus on how it feels.

425
00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:25.310
That's good.

426
00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:28.227
(soft piano music)

427
00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:30.943
You ready to go look at the house?

428
00:25:32.098 --> 00:25:35.799
(soft piano music)

429
00:25:35.799 --> 00:25:37.799
This is the living room.

430
00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:41.393
There's Alan's special chair.

431
00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:45.481
The kitchen.

432
00:25:45.481 --> 00:25:48.398
(soft piano music)

433
00:26:17.575 --> 00:26:21.595
(dog barking in distance)

434
00:26:21.595 --> 00:26:22.800
You're home.

435
00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:23.783
And you're safe.

436
00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:30.813
I know you've forgotten
where you've come from.

437
00:26:32.247 --> 00:26:33.080
but it's okay.

438
00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:35.620
You don't have to remember.

439
00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:39.663
You can start again.

440
00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:41.613
With us.

444
00:27:15.821 --> 00:27:18.571

445
00:27:32.598 --> 00:27:37.181
(operatic singing in foreign language)

446
00:27:53.604 --> 00:27:56.687
(recording skipping)

447
00:27:59.719 --> 00:28:04.302

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:42.463
Searchlight.

454
00:28:43.923 --> 00:28:44.756
Magenta.

455
00:28:45.859 --> 00:28:46.942
Unsound.

456
00:28:47.918 --> 00:28:48.751
Valley.

457
00:28:50.159 --> 00:28:51.789
Riven.

458
00:28:51.789 --> 00:28:54.647
- Your sounds won't keep you safe anymore.

459
00:28:55.494 --> 00:28:56.327
- What?

460
00:28:56.327 --> 00:28:58.760

Here.

462
00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:01.130
- I'm not expecting this.

463
00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:04.430
- Well it was in your box.

464
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:05.923
Am I picking up anything?

465

Just go back to your shrink

- I use you so I don't
have to go to my shrink

479
00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.620
or use a legit pharmacy.

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:45.640
That's the whole point.

481
00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.173

way over your head. kid.

482

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:28.593
- Trudy's wedding dress.

540
00:32:33.125 --> 00:32:34.409
- [Alex] Mom?

541
00:32:34.409 --> 00:32:35.909
- [Martha] Huh? Hm?

542
00:32:38.128 --> 00:32:40.654
- [Alex] What was Dad like?

543
00:32:40.654 --> 00:32:45.228
- [Martha] Oh. well. he was funny.

544
00:32:45.228 --> 00:32:50.228
smart. handsome but.

545
00:32:50.469 --> 00:32:54.767
we're better off. just you and me.

546
00:32:54.767 --> 00:32:57.350
You have his eyes and my heart.

547
00:32:58.766 --> 00:33:00.676
- [Alex] And your butt. maybe.

548
00:33:00.676 --> 00:33:05.609
- [Martha] You fresh
boy. And my butt (laughs)

549
00:33:05.609 --> 00:33:06.557
(clicking sound)

550
00:33:06.557 --> 00:33:08.956
- [Alex] What was Daddy like?

551
00:33:08.956 --> 00:33:11.706
- [Martha] Oh. well. he was funny.

552
00:33:13.436 --> 00:33:15.019
smart. handsome but

553
00:33:17.694 --> 00:33:20.527
we're better off. just you and me.

554
00:33:22.634 --> 00:33:25.551
(voices screaming)

555
00:33:32.197 --> 00:33:34.282
(dial tone humming)

556
00:33:34.282 --> 00:33:36.885
- [Computerized Voice] Hawthorne.

00:33:36.885 --> 00:33:37.718

560
00:33:44.458 --> 00:33:45.291
Kill.

Seven.

562
00:33:49.424 --> 00:33:50.257

(soft dramatic music)

565
00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:00.253
- [Maggie] Get help.

566
00:34:01.379 --> 00:34:04.466
(soft dramatic music)

567
00:34:04.466 --> 00:34:07.216
(deep breathing)

568
00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:17.003
(operatic singing in foreign language)

569
00:34:22.415 --> 00:34:25.415
(muffled screaming)

570
00:34:28.228 --> 00:34:32.812
(operatic singing in foreign language)

571
00:34:37.731 --> 00:34:39.496

572
00:34:39.496 --> 00:34:41.413
- [Rosie] Please don't.

573
00:34:43.321 --> 00:34:46.154
(muffled arguing)

574
00:34:47.373 --> 00:34:50.058
- Stop. Stop. please.

575
00:34:50.058 --> 00:34:52.100
Please stop screaming.

576
00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:53.929
Stop screaming at her.

577
00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:57.471
Get your hands off her.
you son of a bitch!

578
00:34:57.471 --> 00:35:00.221
(hard breathing)

579
00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:35.357
(phone ringing)

580
00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:39.183
- [Marie] Hello?

581
00:35:40.084 --> 00:35:42.800
Ha ha ha. just kidding.

582
00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.173
Leave a message.

583
00:35:46.659 --> 00:35:47.713
- Hey. Doll.

584
00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:52.373
You know what?

585
00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:57.263
I. uh. I forgot to change the
stupid filters again. huh?

586
00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:01.253
And the. the. the vents.

587
00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:06.573
The vents are so dusty.
filters so damn dirty.

588
00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:12.350
I can practically hear you
busting my balls right now.

589
00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:18.807
And then you know what?

590
00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:23.410
Stupid me. I keep forgetting
where like I'm putting stuff.

591
00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:24.243
and I. I.

592
00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:27.043
I catch myself.

593
00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:30.280
I catch myself calling you

594
00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:32.263
and asking you to help me look for it.

595
00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:37.727
The other day. I. uh.

596
00:36:40.356 --> 00:36:41.689
I can't do this.

597
00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:45.223
I miss you so much. god dammit.

598
00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:49.533
I can't do this (cries).

599
00:37:04.812 --> 00:37:07.143
(sighing)

600
00:37:07.143 --> 00:37:10.310
(soft dramatic music)

601
00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:29.873
- Yay!

602
00:37:32.149 --> 00:37:34.290
(laughing)

603
00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:36.383
I knew that smile was in there somewhere.

604
00:37:37.867 --> 00:37:41.034
(soft dramatic music)

605
00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:52.263
No. no. Whatever it is.

606
00:37:53.171 --> 00:37:54.856
don't think about it.

607
00:37:54.856 --> 00:37:57.773
(soft piano music)

608
00:37:59.414 --> 00:38:01.280
(bell ringing)

609
00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.909
Do you hear that?

610
00:38:02.909 --> 00:38:03.742
Hear that?

611
00:38:05.196 --> 00:38:06.029
Here.

612
00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:07.803
Listen.

613
00:38:08.714 --> 00:38:10.800
(bell ringing)

614
00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.350
Whenever the bad thoughts come.

615
00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:16.033
just ring that bell and listen.

616
00:38:17.368 --> 00:38:19.951
(bell ringing)

617
00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:27.630
- What are you doing?

618
00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:30.710
- What do you mean?

619
00:38:32.047 --> 00:38:33.730
- You know. the thing with the kid.

620
00:38:33.730 --> 00:38:35.790
I mean. has the doctor
cleared this thing. or what?

621
00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:36.740
What are you doing?

622
00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:38.673
- Hold on.

623
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:42.133
I just ...

624
00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:46.547
- I have better things for you to be

625
00:38:46.547 --> 00:38:49.556
doing than this.

626
00:38:49.556 --> 00:38:52.036
Let's put this up. Can you put this up?

627
00:38:52.036 --> 00:38:53.107
Hm?

628
00:38:53.107 --> 00:38:56.830
- Well. let me just finish today's entry

629
00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:59.393
before I forget everything. okay?

630
00:39:00.328 --> 00:39:01.161
And just ...

631
00:39:03.765 --> 00:39:05.265
- Yeah. sure. finish whatever.

632
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:11.700
No problem. I might as well
throw my Viagra down the toilet.

633
00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:13.950
(scoffing)

634
00:39:27.543 --> 00:39:29.530
(traffic passing)

635
00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:31.983
- [Ella] Incoming call from Alan.

636
00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:35.820
Incoming call from Alan.

637
00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:36.653
- Answer.

638
00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:38.410
Yeah?

639
00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:40.610
- So you used to have
blackouts. am I right?

640
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:43.740
- Your point being?

641
00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:46.399
- My point being. how's
that piano player of yours?

642
00:39:46.399 --> 00:39:48.020
- [Winters] Why don't
you just spit it out?

643
00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:49.403
- Fine. no problem. how positive are you

644
00:39:49.403 --> 00:39:51.623
that you haven't left that room?

645
00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.270
- Ella. end call.

646
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:56.293
- [Ella] Call ended.

647
00:39:57.524 --> 00:39:58.643
- You son of a bitch.

648
00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:04.680
- Ella. call Leonard.

649
00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:06.784
- [Ella] Calling Leonard.

650
00:40:06.784 --> 00:40:09.701
(knocking on door)

651
00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:15.093
- What happened to your secret knock?

652
00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:23.355
Leonard.

653
00:40:23.355 --> 00:40:25.377
Leonard. Room 201.

654
00:40:25.377 --> 00:40:29.097
(soft dramatic music)

655
00:40:29.097 --> 00:40:31.310
- Martha and Alex.

656
00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:33.010
She sews my uniforms.

657
00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:34.480
Alex lets me play his games.

658
00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.080
- Leonard.

659
00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.930
I have to stop what's happening.
I can't do it by myself.

660
00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:42.360
- I can't do it. I can't help.

661
00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:43.510
I'm broken.

662
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:45.290
- Hey. Leonard.

663
00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:46.860
So am I.

664
00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:48.540
That's what makes us a good team. okay?

665
00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:50.840
That's why we need each other.

666
00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.310
Leonard.

667
00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:54.770
Leonard. you need to tell
me. is there anything

668
00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:57.267
out of the ordinary going
on in this building?

669
00:40:57.267 --> 00:40:59.197
- Out of the ordinary?

670
00:40:59.197 --> 00:41:01.160
Like all this?

671
00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:03.902
Or like you spying on people. like that?

672
00:41:03.902 --> 00:41:04.890
- Hey. that's not what I mean.

673
00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:05.880
Have you seen anyone new.

674
00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.833
anybody that you haven't seen before?

675
00:41:09.404 --> 00:41:10.237
- No.

676
00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:13.470
I tell you everything.

677
00:41:14.943 --> 00:41:17.440
- I'm missing something.
There has to be something.

678
00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:19.420
It's impossible for someone to get in here

679
00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:20.253
without being seen.

680
00:41:20.253 --> 00:41:21.850
That doesn't make any sense.
It has to be something.

681
00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:23.840
It's someone who's
poking their nose around.

682
00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:25.320
someone you didn't let in their apartment.

683
00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:26.483
someone you. something. somebody--

684
00:41:26.483 --> 00:41:27.316
- There is something.

685
00:41:27.316 --> 00:41:28.880
- Who gave you a bad feeling.
- There is something.

686
00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:32.710
- But it's actually nothing.

687
00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:33.543
- What?

688
00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:37.373
- One apartment's empty.
but somebody pays for it.

689
00:41:38.753 --> 00:41:42.643
Harris makes me check the
smoke detectors twice a year.

690
00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:45.210
- Wait. somebody's paying
for an empty apartment?

691
00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:46.043
Since when?

692
00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:49.293
- After you moved in.

693
00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:52.193
A week later. I think.

694
00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:56.300
- Good. go there.

695
00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:57.223
- Come with me.

696
00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.880
- I can't.

697
00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:01.560
Every time I walk out
that door. it feels like

698
00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:03.700
my chest is gonna explode.
do you understand?

699
00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:05.763
That's what it feels like. okay?

700
00:42:06.612 --> 00:42:09.750
Okay. either way it doesn't
matter. It's not ...

701
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:11.963
It's me they want. okay? It's not you.

702
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.445
They know I need you.

703
00:42:14.445 --> 00:42:15.278
You're ...

704
00:42:15.278 --> 00:42:18.445
(soft dramatic music)

705
00:42:20.583 --> 00:42:21.500
- I'm what?

706
00:42:24.539 --> 00:42:25.903
- You're useful.

707
00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:28.153
You're useful.

708
00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:32.060
Leonard. I'll buy you whatever you want.

709
00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:33.883
Okay. name it. Just help me.

710
00:42:35.946 --> 00:42:37.963
- I don't want any more collectibles.

711
00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:41.343
I just wanna go home and watch cartoons.

712
00:42:42.778 --> 00:42:46.030
I'm going to go peek one last time

713
00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:48.973
so you get off my back.

714
00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:51.813
- Thank you.

715
00:42:54.522 --> 00:42:56.572
You're the most intrepid man that I know.

716
00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:00.323
- Intrepid.

717
00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:03.540
Valiant. bold. fearless?

718
00:43:06.596 --> 00:43:08.253
I'm not any of that.

719
00:43:08.253 --> 00:43:11.420
(soft dramatic music)

720
00:43:14.545 --> 00:43:17.430
(muffled shouting)

721
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:19.265
(door opening and closing)

722
00:43:19.265 --> 00:43:21.540
- [Ella] Window. window.

723
00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:23.090
- Ella. stop the alarm.

724
00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:24.523
- [Ella] Alarm stopped.

725
00:43:29.592 --> 00:43:32.759
(soft dramatic music)

726
00:43:34.001 --> 00:43:37.698
(knocking on door)

727
00:43:37.698 --> 00:43:38.531
- Leonard. what ...

728
00:43:38.531 --> 00:43:40.113
- Hey. so this is ...

729
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:45.790
Do I know you?

730
00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:46.838
- No.

731
00:43:46.838 --> 00:43:48.420
I mean. I don't think so.

732
00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:51.390
I mean. I feel like I'd remember.

733
00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:56.250
- Uh. well. this cute girl
just came by my house.

734
00:43:56.250 --> 00:43:57.950
She shoved this at me.
and then she ran off.

735
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:59.750
But it's got your address on it.

736
00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:00.673
- Cute? Cute how?

737
00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:03.153
- I don't know.

738
00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:06.700
She had brown hair and green eyes.

739
00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:11.670
- Yeah. yeah. I know who
you're talking about.

740
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:15.423
- Okay. She seemed upset.

741
00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:18.203
Do you want it or not?

742
00:44:21.084 --> 00:44:22.650
(muffled shouting)

743
00:44:22.650 --> 00:44:23.493
Oh my God.

744
00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:28.059
Is that a TEAC? A TEAC 3340?

745
00:44:28.059 --> 00:44:29.810
- Hey. what are you doing?

746
00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:31.000
Hey. what are you doing?

747
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.663
- Who's the dick next door?

748
00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:35.350
- [Shawn] You're nothing.
you're worthless!

749
00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:36.713
- Four separate channels.

750
00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:39.870
Can record eight sources simultaneously

751
00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:42.200
or one channel at a time synchronously.

752
00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:44.830
Independent microphone inputs.

753
00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:47.833
Line inputs and outputs.
each with their own controls.

754
00:44:48.749 --> 00:44:51.163
Unlimited mixing options.

755
00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:55.463
And a classic '70s analog sound.

756
00:44:59.974 --> 00:45:02.170
(chuckling)

757
00:45:02.170 --> 00:45:03.758
(soft music)

758
00:45:03.758 --> 00:45:04.591
Wow.

759
00:45:04.591 --> 00:45:07.008
(soft music)

760
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:12.263
Sorry.

761
00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:14.920
I'm kind of an audiophile.

762
00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:18.043
I get it from my dad.

763
00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:22.173
What is this place?

764
00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:27.010
Oh my God. are you a
sound effects designer?

765
00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:29.144
- Hey. no. don't walk on that. please.

766
00:45:29.144 --> 00:45:32.030
(laughing)

767
00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:35.630
- Hey. do you mix music and
sound effects for live shows?

768
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:37.040
Because I'm camgirl right now.

769
00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:39.053
but I've got this act I
wanna take on the road.

770
00:45:39.053 --> 00:45:40.980
I've got an audition at the
Garter Room in a couple days.

771
00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:43.180
- Stop touching things. please.

772
00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:45.340
No. I don't really do that
sort of thing. although I could

773
00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:48.350
probably mix circles around
whoever you're using.

774
00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:49.823
- Oh. well. that would be me.

775
00:45:50.863 --> 00:45:52.723
I'm trying to produce my own mix track.

776
00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:54.930
- Produce it yourself?

777
00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:56.863
- Yeah.

778
00:45:58.470 --> 00:46:01.223
I haven't found anybody that I like yet.

779
00:46:01.223 --> 00:46:04.140
(muffled shouting)

780
00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:08.543
- You mean you want me
to help you produce it?

781
00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:11.413
- Maybe.

782
00:46:13.530 --> 00:46:16.489
- Yeah. I'd love to. I'm just.
I'm kinda tied up right now

783
00:46:16.489 --> 00:46:19.880
with a couple things. and
even if I was available.

784
00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:23.133
it's not. it's not really
the sort of thing I do.

785
00:46:27.327 --> 00:46:29.430
- Look. if you change your mind.

786
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:32.030
I live in this little house
right across the street.

787
00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:39.345
You can come over if you want.

788
00:46:39.345 --> 00:46:42.262
(muffled shouting)

789
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:47.950
Try telling that guy to suck your balls.

790
00:46:51.694 --> 00:46:54.474
(door opening)

791
00:46:54.474 --> 00:46:58.120
(muffled shouting)

792
00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:00.623
- Suck my fucking balls. bitch!

793
00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:07.190
Did you see that girl?

794
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:08.140
She was hot. right?

795
00:47:10.944 --> 00:47:13.480
- I found this in there.

796
00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:15.230
- That was in there. the apartment?

797
00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.883
- On the floor. in the middle of the room.

798
00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.303
- Okay. let's see what's on it.

799
00:47:23.994 --> 00:47:24.827
- Don't.

800
00:47:25.967 --> 00:47:26.800
- I have to.

801
00:47:29.884 --> 00:47:31.313
- I'm going home.

802
00:47:34.786 --> 00:47:39.786
If anything happens to me.
you were the best boss.

803
00:47:40.239 --> 00:47:41.072
Boss.

804
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:44.963
- What are you talking about?
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

805
00:47:54.182 --> 00:47:57.765
(door opening and closing)

806
00:48:00.041 --> 00:48:03.208
(soft dramatic music)

807
00:48:07.164 --> 00:48:09.016
- [Disguised Voice] Marie?

808
00:48:09.016 --> 00:48:10.766
- [Marie] Oh God. hi.

809
00:48:11.971 --> 00:48:13.010
- [Disguised Voice] How
are we feeling today?

810
00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:15.450
- [Marie] A little better than yesterday.

811
00:48:15.450 --> 00:48:17.203
but not so hot.

812
00:48:19.128 --> 00:48:20.147
- [Disguised Voice]
Let's get you hooked up.

813
00:48:20.147 --> 00:48:23.630
- [Marie] Do you know what
time the doctor's coming today?

814
00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:25.524
- [Disguised Voice] Oh. you
won't need the doctor today.

815
00:48:25.524 --> 00:48:27.052
You're checking out.

816
00:48:27.052 --> 00:48:27.885
- [Marie] What?

817
00:48:27.885 --> 00:48:32.885
He said I'm showing improvement.
but I have questions.

818
00:48:33.088 --> 00:48:34.890
- [Disguised Voice] Save the questions.

819
00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:37.139
Let's get this in your PICC line.

820
00:48:37.139 --> 00:48:38.161
- [Marie] What is it?

821
00:48:38.161 --> 00:48:39.789
- [Disguised Voice] Potassium chloride.

822
00:48:39.789 --> 00:48:42.294
- [Marie] What? What's that for?

823
00:48:42.294 --> 00:48:43.846
- [Disguised Voice] For
the damage you've done.

824
00:48:43.846 --> 00:48:45.711
(Marie crying)

825
00:48:45.711 --> 00:48:48.299
(soft dramatic music)

826
00:48:48.299 --> 00:48:49.716
[Disguised Voice] I hope you rot.

827
00:48:57.484 --> 00:48:59.651
(banging)

828
00:49:04.326 --> 00:49:06.058
- [Maggie] Is it you?

829
00:49:06.058 --> 00:49:08.975
(knocking on door)

830
00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:26.473
- Harris.

831
00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:30.940
- You know that nice
young couple down in 102?

832
00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:33.870
Just moved in. you know the ones.

833
00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:34.703
- How would I know?

834
00:49:34.703 --> 00:49:35.643
- They found this.

835
00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:39.270
Apparently. they're too
stupid to know what it is.

836
00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:41.690
They thought the vent was broken.

837
00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:42.789
Can you believe it?

838
00:49:42.789 --> 00:49:44.480
- I don't know what you're talking about.

839
00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:47.210
- Those are my tenants.

840
00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:48.440
- Oh. now you care about them.

841
00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:50.503
It's funny. since you're
always screwing them over.

842
00:49:50.503 --> 00:49:51.500
- When am I getting those tapes?

843
00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:53.100
- When I get my deposit back.

844
00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:54.870
- That's the wrong
answer. I want them now.

845
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:56.310
- That empty room. the one that's being

846
00:49:56.310 --> 00:49:57.853
paid for. who's renting it?

847
00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:00.410
- How'd you know about that?

848
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:06.693
- Those recordings I have of
you. they'd ruin you forever.

849
00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:12.110
- Well it's a cash deal.

850
00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:15.233
No paperwork.

851
00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:19.373
They get a key and
anonymity. and I get greased.

852
00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:22.540
Triple the going rate.

853
00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:23.580
- Triple?

854
00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:24.830
- Yeah. triple.

855
00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:27.323
You know what?

856
00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:33.630
Your rent-free days. they're over.

857
00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:35.720
Another thing. tomorrow.

858
00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:39.470
Tomorrow. we start our
routine building inspection.

859
00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:43.140
so then I'm gonna personally
scour every fucking nook

860
00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:45.570
and cranny. looking for
more of your damn bugs.

861
00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:46.403
- No. you can't do that.

862
00:50:46.403 --> 00:50:48.740
You have to give more notice
than that. It's the law.

863
00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:50.580
- Oh. it's the law.

864
00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:55.580
Well. the notices went out
two weeks ago. smart ass.

865
00:50:57.006 --> 00:50:59.370
It was slipped under the
door. just like everyone else.

866
00:50:59.370 --> 00:51:00.793
You didn't get yours?

867
00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:03.183
Really (laughs)?

868
00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:05.423
I can swear ...

869
00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:10.903
If I hear you tapping anyone
else or doing anything shady

870
00:51:10.903 --> 00:51:14.670
in this fucking building.
I don't give a flying fuck

871
00:51:14.670 --> 00:51:16.283
in hell what you got on me.

872
00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:19.791
I'm gonna bring the heat down on you.

873
00:51:19.791 --> 00:51:22.958
(soft dramatic music)

874
00:51:23.936 --> 00:51:25.269
Have a nice day.

875
00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:31.250
- Ella. call Leonard.

876
00:51:31.250 --> 00:51:32.776
- [Ella] Calling Leonard.

877
00:51:32.776 --> 00:51:36.130
(phone ringing)

878
00:51:36.130 --> 00:51:37.670
- [Leonard] Hello.

879
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:39.720
- Is Harris doing an inspection tomorrow?

880
00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:43.638
- [Leonard] Yeah. tomorrow
we're doing the inspection.

881
00:51:43.638 --> 00:51:45.840
- Why didn't I get a notice?

882
00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:48.600
- [Leonard] Because he leaves you alone.

883
00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:49.770
He never inspects your unit.

884
00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:51.500
- Harris found the bug in 102.

885
00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:53.663
Clearly. you did a very sloppy job. okay.

886
00:51:53.663 --> 00:51:56.440
They are going to find the piano player.

887
00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:57.960
They are going to find Martha and Alex.

888
00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:00.030
They're going to find all of our bugs.

889
00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:01.720
They're gonna pull all of our bugs.

890
00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:03.310
and then we're done for.

891
00:52:03.310 --> 00:52:06.463
Okay. so we need to
pull the bugs right now.

892
00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:09.603
Are you even listening?

893
00:52:11.816 --> 00:52:15.390
- [Leonard] If I do it. if I
get all the bugs. are we done?

894
00:52:17.035 --> 00:52:18.580
Are we done sneaking?

895
00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:20.620
- No more sneaking. No. never again.

896
00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:22.903
And this way no one else gets hurt. okay?

897
00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:27.130
- [Leonard] Sounds good to me. Boss.

898
00:52:27.130 --> 00:52:30.000
I'll figure out how to
get them this afternoon.

899
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:31.000
- [Ella] Call ended.

900
00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:36.220
- Ella. call Alan.

901
00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:38.047
- [Ella] Calling Alan.

902
00:52:38.047 --> 00:52:40.500
(phone ringing)

903
00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:42.290
- [Alan] You know what.
if I would have known

904
00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:44.530
that disowning you was
gonna make you talk to me

905
00:52:44.530 --> 00:52:46.760
more in two days than you have in a year.

906
00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:48.420
I would have asked you to move in instead.

907
00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:52.230
Then you woulda gone running
in the opposite direction. huh?

908
00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:55.867
- I swear to you. I haven't hurt a soul.

909
00:52:56.792 --> 00:52:59.283
I know I'm fucked up.

910
00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:02.980
Okay. I know that. I realize that.

911
00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:07.980
But I. I. and I don't know
why I abandoned Marie.

912
00:53:08.370 --> 00:53:09.403
Something ...

913
00:53:11.650 --> 00:53:14.593
Just something pulled me
away. okay. but I. I ...

914
00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:17.957
I need one thing.

915
00:53:17.957 --> 00:53:18.810
- (chuckles) Oh.

916
00:53:18.810 --> 00:53:20.780
- Marie's journals. bring them. please.

917
00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:22.990
My bugs are the only road
map I have to figure out

918
00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:25.430
what's happening. and I
am about to lose them.

919
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:26.450
- Enough.

920
00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:29.290
- People are being
killed. Marie was killed.

921
00:53:29.290 --> 00:53:31.940
Her journals can help me stop the killer.

922
00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:34.060
I need the info in those journals.

923
00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:36.380
Every nightmare. blackout.
episode I've ever had

924
00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:38.560
are in those journals. I need them please.

925
00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:41.700
- You know. I am so done with
your conspiracy theories.

926
00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:43.070
- You've hated me from Day One. man.

927
00:53:43.070 --> 00:53:46.920
You want me to fail. You want
me to be locked up with Iris.

928
00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:50.060
- You know what? Do not
put this on me. all right?

929
00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:53.840
- No. no. because you had
to share Marie with me.

930
00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:55.450
because you never wanted kids.

931
00:53:55.450 --> 00:53:58.440
because she could never
have any kids of her own.

932
00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:01.510
so she was your perfect match.

933
00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:05.870
And then I came along and
I ruined it all for you.

934
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:10.833
and you have only seen the
worst in me ever since.

935
00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:14.210
Right or wrong?

936
00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:16.200
Right or wrong?

937
00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:19.915
- Look. I was not built
for this shit. all right?

938
00:54:19.915 --> 00:54:22.200
And I never have been.

939
00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:24.908
(phone beeping)

940
00:54:24.908 --> 00:54:25.741
Ugh.

941
00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:33.150
(inhaling)

942
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:39.391
- [Becky] In this building lately.

943
00:54:39.391 --> 00:54:40.841

949
00:55:04.078 --> 00:55:06.638
(exhaling)

950
00:55:06.638 --> 00:55:09.221
- What now. what now. what now?

951
00:55:11.086 --> 00:55:14.291
(soft tapping on wall)

952
00:55:14.291 --> 00:55:17.458
(soft dramatic music)

953
00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:19.363
- Rosie?

954
00:55:21.963 --> 00:55:23.233
Is that you?

955
00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:29.540
Do you need help?

956
00:55:32.932 --> 00:55:37.932
- [Shawn] Go on. Take one
step outside that apartment.

957
00:55:37.971 --> 00:55:39.304
And I'll kill you.

958
00:55:40.243 --> 00:55:42.910
(birds singing)

959
00:55:44.463 --> 00:55:47.380
(soft piano music)

960
00:56:35.453 --> 00:56:36.286
(recorder beeping)

961
00:56:36.286 --> 00:56:39.373
- [Marie] This is not a
normal journal entry. Alan.

962
00:56:39.373 --> 00:56:41.270
I'm gonna tell you but
if something happens.

963
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:43.193
I. I hope you get this.

964
00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:47.400
There is an odd woman. She
works here at the hospital.

965
00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:48.820
Or I thought she did.

966
00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:51.210
She comes around checking
on me. making small talk.

967
00:56:51.210 --> 00:56:54.910
so over time I ended up
telling her about him.

968
00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:58.380
The work we did. his
therapy. even my journals

969
00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:00.230
and that my old ones are in the shed.

970
00:57:01.730 --> 00:57:06.099
Today. I admitted I suppressed
his memories using sound.

971
00:57:06.099 --> 00:57:08.683
and she demanded to read my journals.

972
00:57:08.683 --> 00:57:11.190
When I told her no. she became enraged

973
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:12.393
and then stormed out.

974
00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:14.553
She frightened me.

975
00:57:15.555 --> 00:57:19.097
I'm sorry. Alan. but I
think we're in danger.

976
00:57:20.031 --> 00:57:20.948
I love you.

977
00:57:22.217 --> 00:57:25.384
(soft dramatic music)

978
00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:35.483
- No no no no no.

980
00:57:43.090 --> 00:57:43.923
Dammit.

981
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:45.773

What?

998
00:58:19.343 --> 00:58:21.250
- If that song triggered something in you.

999
00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:22.930
it might do the same thing for Iris.

1000
00:58:22.930 --> 00:58:24.473
Send it right now. okay?

00:58:25.943 --> 00:58:27.426

What's wrong with her?

- Catatonic schizophrenia.
she's had it for some time now.

1018
01:00:28.946 --> 01:00:31.847
- Can she communicate with me?

1019
01:00:31.847 --> 01:00:34.351
- She can't speak or respond or move.

1020
01:00:34.351 --> 01:00:36.363
- Is she gonna be able to hear me?

1021
01:00:38.577 --> 01:00:40.748
- I think she can. but
you wouldn't know it.

1022

01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:43.236
I mean. what are we talking about here.

1024
01:00:43.236 --> 01:00:44.423
some kind of trauma or something?

1025
01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:46.850
- There are environmental triggers.

1026
01:00:46.850 --> 01:00:48.300
but genetics play a part too.

1027
01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:50.813
- Great.

1028
01:00:54.335 --> 01:00:56.673
No no. no no. you don't have to do that.

1029
01:00:58.839 --> 01:00:59.689
- You a relative?

- Yes.

1035
01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:22.900
- I was in high school when that happened.

1036
01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:24.400
How's he doing?

1037
01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.650
- He's good. really good.

1038
01:01:26.675 --> 01:01:28.840
- You know. when they found
her wandering the fields.

1039
01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:32.413
I just thought. only a
monster could be responsible.

1040
01:01:32.413 --> 01:01:33.593
- Yeah.

1041
01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:37.290
- Did they ever find out what happened?

1042
01:01:37.290 --> 01:01:38.663

1046
01:01:47.550 --> 01:01:49.850
Tell her about her boy.
I think she'd like it.

1047

You wanna give me a sign or?

1054
01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:19.433
I. uh. I guess I should apologize.

1055
01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.820
I mean. all those years and we never

1056
01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:24.320
brought him here to visit you.

1057
01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:28.293
Marie never wanted to.

1058
01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:37.380
You know. the funny thing is. I.

1059
01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:38.743
I feel guilty about it now.

1060
01:02:41.610 --> 01:02:42.585
I don't know.

1061
01:02:42.585 --> 01:02:45.957
Maybe seeing him woulda
helped you and him.

1062
01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:52.040
I raised your boy.

1063
01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:53.883
I mean. I tried to at least.

1064
01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:57.410
And I guess I could
have done a better job.

1065
01:02:58.919 --> 01:03:02.086
(soft dramatic music)

1066
01:03:07.193 --> 01:03:10.110

Hey. um.

1069
01:03:31.283 --> 01:03:35.307
does this sound. sound familiar to you?

1070
01:03:36.314 --> 01:03:40.897
(operatic singing in foreign language)

1071
01:04:19.327 --> 01:04:22.244

1072
01:04:23.497 --> 01:04:26.476
(knocking on door)

1073
01:04:26.476 --> 01:04:29.240
- I don't have time for this right now.

1074
01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:31.040
- You've been watching me with that.

1075
01:04:33.210 --> 01:04:35.513
I came in earlier. and
I saw it. and I knew.

1076
01:04:38.690 --> 01:04:40.863
I let men watch me for a living.

1077
01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:43.470
I know what it feels like.

1078
01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:47.000
Somebody's eyes. when
someone looks at you.

1079
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.483
there's a contact. there's a vibe.

1080
01:04:52.173 --> 01:04:53.803
I can feel your fucked up vibe.

1081
01:04:58.163 --> 01:05:00.483
When I came in earlier. I saw it.

1082
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:05.740
You knew exactly who I was when you

1083
01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:08.170
opened that door. didn't you?

1084
01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:10.983
You put that girl up.
just to make me come over.

1085
01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:17.233
It's fine.

1086
01:05:17.233 --> 01:05:20.520
(soft dramatic music)

1087
01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.280
Hey. I'm used to it.

1088
01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:23.880
Men have been watching me since

1089
01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:25.840
before I had my first period.

1090
01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:29.003
They usually just pay for it.

1091
01:05:30.771 --> 01:05:32.471
I just wanted you to be different.

1092
01:05:35.196 --> 01:05:36.096
Are you different?

1093
01:05:39.256 --> 01:05:41.412
- I think you're in danger.

1094
01:05:41.412 --> 01:05:42.512
- What?

1095
01:05:42.512 --> 01:05:45.113
- You have to keep away
from me. away from here.

1096
01:05:46.123 --> 01:05:47.339
- Ow. let go. you're hurting me.

1097
01:05:47.339 --> 01:05:49.660
- It wasn't my messenger.
Someone lured you here.

1098
01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:51.320
I'm sorry for watching.

1099
01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:55.633
Okay. I just. when I noticed
you. it made me feel ...

1100
01:05:58.010 --> 01:05:58.843
You have to go.

1101
01:06:04.970 --> 01:06:06.560
Ella. call Leonard.

1102
01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:08.640
- [Ella] Calling Leonard.

1103
01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:11.210
We're sorry. you have reached a number

1104
01:06:11.210 --> 01:06:14.623
that has been disconnected
or is no longer in service.

1105
01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:16.395
If you feel have reached--

1106
01:06:16.395 --> 01:06:17.510
- Ella. end call.

1107
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:18.400
- [Ella] Call ended.

1108
01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:20.050
- Ella. call Leonard.

1109
01:06:20.050 --> 01:06:21.433
- [Ella] Calling Leonard.

1110
01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:25.339
We're sorry. you have reached
a number that has been--

1111
01:06:25.339 --> 01:06:26.256
- End call.

1112
01:06:27.093 --> 01:06:27.926
- [Disguised Voice] I have your messenger.

1113
01:06:31.699 --> 01:06:32.866
I'll get Alan.

1114
01:06:33.718 --> 01:06:35.468
And you are to blame.

1115
01:06:37.498 --> 01:06:40.120
Because you forgot about me.

1116
01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:41.063
- Stop.

1117
01:06:42.589 --> 01:06:43.960
- I'll kill them.

1118
01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:44.793
- What?

1119
01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:47.723
- The way I killed Marie.

1120
01:06:49.991 --> 01:06:53.549
(device smashing)

1121
01:06:53.549 --> 01:06:56.466
(knocking on door)

1122
01:06:59.347 --> 01:07:00.870
- The journals?

1123
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:02.163
- They're gone. taken.

1124
01:07:03.930 --> 01:07:05.470
I saw Iris.

1125
01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:07.360
There's more to this than I thought.

1126
01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:08.363
- [Winters] Yeah. tell me about it.

1127
01:07:08.363 --> 01:07:10.000
- [Alan] What do you have?

1128
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.650
- They're recordings being left in each

1129
01:07:11.650 --> 01:07:13.300
of the apartments in the building.

1130
01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:15.980
Layers under layers under layers of sound.

1131
01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:17.490
There's a message in here somewhere.

1132
01:07:17.490 --> 01:07:19.750
- Help me. I need your help to figure ...

1133
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:20.900
I have pieces.

1134
01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:21.733
Okay. do you understand?

1135
01:07:21.733 --> 01:07:26.430
I have pieces that I need to
find out how they fit together.

1136
01:07:26.430 --> 01:07:27.900
I don't know how to do that.

1137
01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:29.123
- Neither do I. kid.

1138
01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:32.400
You started to remember
when you were little.

1139
01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:33.990
but Marie stopped you.

1140
01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:34.840
You remember how?

1141
01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:38.023
Sounds.

1142
01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:42.060
She made you listen to different sounds.

1143
01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:44.000
You'd think of something horrible.

1144
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.790
She shifted your attention.

1145
01:07:45.790 --> 01:07:47.090
Now look at what you do for a living?

1146
01:07:47.090 --> 01:07:48.460
Huh? Boom.

1147
01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:51.060
You've buried your memories
a little more every day.

1148
01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:53.340
- Do you hear that?

1149
01:07:56.050 --> 01:07:57.300
When I was little. I was.

1150
01:07:58.893 --> 01:08:02.140
I was held captive somewhere by my father.

1151
01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:06.650
We were kept in small
rooms. no outside contact.

1152
01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:08.350
- You've regressed back to that time.

1153
01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:09.880
Now you're holding yourself prisoner.

1154
01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:11.343
- My father. he.

1155
01:08:14.134 --> 01:08:18.059
he would lure people back
to the house somehow.

1156
01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:21.660
and he'd bring them in the garage and.

1157
01:08:24.979 --> 01:08:26.362
he'd butcher them.

1158
01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:30.610
The same way he'd butcher deer.

1159
01:08:30.610 --> 01:08:33.780
the same way he would rip off their skin

1160
01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:34.850
and take out their organs.

1161
01:08:34.850 --> 01:08:35.897
he butchered the people the same way.

1162
01:08:35.897 --> 01:08:39.300
and this song. this song.
it would play over and over

1163
01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:42.830
and over again. and Iris.
Mom. she went crazy.

1164
01:08:42.830 --> 01:08:44.647
and then she started
seeing things and hearing--

1165
01:08:44.647 --> 01:08:46.206
- Kid kid. kid kid.

1166
01:08:46.206 --> 01:08:47.120
Listen to me.

1167
01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:50.069
Marie mentioned a woman
who was interested in you.

1168
01:08:50.069 --> 01:08:53.010
And when you were young.
you had dreams of a girl.

1169
01:08:53.010 --> 01:08:54.510
Could they be the same person?

1170
01:08:55.916 --> 01:08:57.223
(knocking on door)

1171
01:08:57.223 --> 01:08:58.226

1172

Six.

1173
01:08:59.469 --> 01:09:00.753
- Leonard probably.

1174
01:09:01.753 --> 01:09:04.920
(soft dramatic music)

1175
01:09:07.715 --> 01:09:11.134
- Stay the fuck away from my bitch.

1176
01:09:11.134 --> 01:09:12.350
- [Alan] What the fuck are you doing?

1177
01:09:12.350 --> 01:09:13.521
(punches striking)

1178
01:09:13.521 --> 01:09:16.438
(Winters groaning)

1179
01:09:19.528 --> 01:09:21.778
(groaning)

1180
01:09:27.714 --> 01:09:30.464
(hard breathing)

1181
01:09:35.350 --> 01:09:37.987
- Rosie. what are you doing here?

1182
01:09:39.170 --> 01:09:40.003
- Sorry.

1183
01:09:40.947 --> 01:09:43.147
Shawn really did a
number on you. didn't he?

1184
01:09:44.530 --> 01:09:45.462
He's gone now.

1185
01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:48.353
I'm not sure for how long. but oh.

1186
01:09:49.979 --> 01:09:54.219
After he beat you. I
finally stood up to him.

1187
01:09:54.219 --> 01:09:55.990
I told him that he was
probably gonna take the fall

1188
01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:59.150
for Harris' death. and
I wasn't gonna deny it.

1189
01:09:59.150 --> 01:10:00.773
- Harris. what are you talking about?

1190
01:10:01.889 --> 01:10:04.460
- They found him a couple hours ago.

1191
01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:06.090
Mrs. Arenberg found him.

1192
01:10:06.090 --> 01:10:07.648
- Mrs. Arenberg?

1193
01:10:07.648 --> 01:10:12.190
- Yeah. apparently her dryer
didn't get fixed properly.

1194
01:10:12.190 --> 01:10:14.290
and so she went to complain about it.

1195
01:10:14.290 --> 01:10:17.870
and she found him there.
cut from head to toe.

1196
01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:18.870
- My friend Alan ...

1197
01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:23.630
My dad. did you see him here?

1198
01:10:23.630 --> 01:10:26.883
- No. just Shawn and that woman.

1199
01:10:30.398 --> 01:10:31.797
I wanted to say thank you.

1200
01:10:35.564 --> 01:10:36.950
- For what?

1201
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:39.000
Another notch on the long
list of getting my ass kicked?

1202
01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:39.923
Don't mention it.

1203
01:10:43.950 --> 01:10:45.200
- For sticking up for me.

1204
01:10:46.210 --> 01:10:49.083
I'm gonna go. and I'm not coming back.

1205

01:19:15.893 --> 01:19:17.059
- Duplicitous?

1259
01:19:21.915 --> 01:19:23.332
- Deceitful. sly.

1260
01:19:27.483 --> 01:19:28.316
Sneaky.

1261
01:19:32.130 --> 01:19:32.963
- Leonard?

1262
01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:37.687
You've been useful.

1263
01:19:39.777 --> 01:19:42.527
(dramatic music)

1264
01:19:43.930 --> 01:19:45.834
- No. no. no no.

1265
01:19:45.834 --> 01:19:49.001
(soft dramatic music)

1266
01:19:54.574 --> 01:19:56.508
You were the best boss.

1267
01:19:56.508 --> 01:19:59.675
(soft dramatic music)

1268
01:20:12.275 --> 01:20:15.942
(train passing in distance)

1269
01:20:19.339 --> 01:20:22.505
(soft dramatic music)

1270
01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:52.219
- [Maggie] Hey. you remember this?

1271
01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:56.160
You remember what I
showed you on the beach?

1272
01:20:57.787 --> 01:21:00.954
(soft dramatic music)

1273
01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:05.433
- Maggie?

1274
01:21:12.650 --> 01:21:13.483
Hello?

1275
01:21:15.592 --> 01:21:16.759
- [Maggie] Hi.

1276
01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:19.633
- [Winters] Maggie. is that you?

1277
01:21:21.215 --> 01:21:22.693
I can't believe it.

1278
01:21:22.693 --> 01:21:25.861
(soft dramatic music)

1279
01:21:28.657 --> 01:21:29.857
- Did you say hi to Dad?

1280
01:21:31.361 --> 01:21:33.543
- [Winters] What have
you done to those people?

1281
01:21:33.543 --> 01:21:35.403
- They're not people anymore.

1282
01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:39.023
Marie was my favorite.

1283
01:21:40.344 --> 01:21:43.164
- I would have died for you.

1284
01:21:43.164 --> 01:21:45.394
- It's not too late for that.

1285
01:21:45.394 --> 01:21:48.561
(soft dramatic music)

1286
01:21:57.213 --> 01:22:00.880
(train passing in distance)

1287
01:22:06.698 --> 01:22:09.865
(soft dramatic music)

1288
01:22:42.208 --> 01:22:44.958
(hard breathing)

1289
01:22:47.205 --> 01:22:50.046
- Alan. Alan.

1290
01:22:50.046 --> 01:22:52.557
- They don't make me like
they used to. huh. kid?

1291
01:22:55.817 --> 01:22:58.017
- You finally came to
help with my mix tape.

1292
01:22:58.930 --> 01:22:59.920
How neighborly.

1293
01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:01.420
- What the fuck is your problem already?

1294
01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:03.330
- That bitch made you forget about me.

1295
01:23:03.330 --> 01:23:05.780
That's my fucking problem.

1296
01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:07.253
I came to make you remember.

1297
01:23:08.309 --> 01:23:10.980
- So that's what this is about. revenge?

1298
01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:12.112
How original.

1299
01:23:13.001 --> 01:23:15.760
I remember everything
now. Can we all go home?

1300
01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:17.713
- Prove it. Prove you remember.

1301
01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:22.541
Tell me how it started.
Tell me how it began.

1302
01:23:22.541 --> 01:23:24.880
- It began.
- Tell me.

1303
01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:26.260
- Wait wait wait.

1304
01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:30.800
It began when Mom
started to lose her grip.

1305
01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:33.109
Dad. Dad snapped.

1306
01:23:33.109 --> 01:23:33.942
- Then what?

1307
01:23:33.942 --> 01:23:36.554
- He wouldn't let us outside.
kept us in our rooms.

1308
01:23:36.554 --> 01:23:37.387
He kept us prisoner.

1309
01:23:37.387 --> 01:23:38.219
- And?

1310
01:23:40.210 --> 01:23:41.160
- He killed people.

1311
01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:46.003
He brought them home. and he killed them.

1312
01:23:51.227 --> 01:23:52.227
He made you.

1313
01:23:55.016 --> 01:23:56.766
He made you help him.

1314
01:23:59.148 --> 01:24:03.321
The way you helped him
before when we'd go hunting.

1315
01:24:03.321 --> 01:24:04.840
The way you helped him
gut and skin the deer.

1316
01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:07.082
he made you help with the people.

1317
01:24:07.082 --> 01:24:09.165
(crying)

1318
01:24:10.263 --> 01:24:11.773
You protected me.

1319
01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:19.500
- From our rooms. we'd
hear the bad noises.

1320
01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:23.362
so we made up our own games.

1321
01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:29.893
Knocking on the walls.
talking through them. singing.

1322
01:24:29.893 --> 01:24:30.732
Do you remember?

1323
01:24:30.732 --> 01:24:32.165
- Yeah I do.

1324
01:24:32.165 --> 01:24:33.360
When he came home. he knew I left.

1325
01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:36.030
and so he beat me up and
he messed me up here.

1326
01:24:36.030 --> 01:24:37.153
and then when. when.

1327
01:24:39.053 --> 01:24:41.143
when he saw that I was broken.

1328
01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:44.330
he saw that I couldn't remember things.

1329
01:24:44.330 --> 01:24:47.750
he abandoned me and he abandoned Mom.

1330
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:49.805
What did he do to you?

1331
01:24:49.805 --> 01:24:52.972
(soft dramatic music)

1332
01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:56.733
- He sold me.

1333
01:24:59.889 --> 01:25:01.133
He let men rape me.

1334
01:25:04.467 --> 01:25:06.380
I was just a little girl.

1335
01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:10.443
I was just a little girl.

1336
01:25:12.641 --> 01:25:13.967
(crying)

1337
01:25:13.967 --> 01:25:15.103
But I was strong.

1338
01:25:18.318 --> 01:25:19.151
And you.

1339
01:25:20.261 --> 01:25:21.964
you were a coward.

1340
01:25:21.964 --> 01:25:24.003
You could have gone for help
that day. and you didn't.

1341
01:25:25.016 --> 01:25:27.118
Then someone would havee found me.

1342
01:25:27.118 --> 01:25:28.868
and I coulda had a normal life too.

1343
01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:32.303
You had everything.

1344
01:25:34.530 --> 01:25:37.330
And all this time. you never
had to remember a goddam thing.

1345
01:25:37.330 --> 01:25:38.960
- Wait. no no no. you're wrong.

1346
01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:41.250
I did remember you. just not
in the way that you thought.

1347
01:25:41.250 --> 01:25:43.430
- You are such a liar.

1348
01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:44.263
- Stop it.

1349
01:25:44.263 --> 01:25:45.223
You read the journals.

1350
01:25:46.639 --> 01:25:49.610
That day Marie found me.
I whispered something

1351
01:25:49.610 --> 01:25:51.660
into that seashell. you read that. right?

1352
01:25:54.150 --> 01:25:56.523
Remember what I whispered into it now?

1353
01:25:59.230 --> 01:26:00.357
It was your name.

1354
01:26:02.670 --> 01:26:04.663
You showed me that. do you remember?

1355
01:26:05.690 --> 01:26:07.820
How to make a wish if you
couldn't see the stars.

1356
01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:09.410
That's the last thing I did

1357
01:26:09.410 --> 01:26:11.059
before I forgot about everything.

1358
01:26:14.438 --> 01:26:16.728
You were my wish.

1359
01:26:16.728 --> 01:26:18.380
(crying)

1360
01:26:18.380 --> 01:26:20.130
That's why I can't have
normal relationships.

1361
01:26:20.130 --> 01:26:21.820
That's why I couldn't deal
with Marie getting sick.

1362
01:26:21.820 --> 01:26:24.620
because I was going to lose
her the way that I lost you.

1363
01:26:29.380 --> 01:26:30.297
Losing you.

1364
01:26:36.100 --> 01:26:37.343
that's what broke me.

1365
01:26:39.969 --> 01:26:42.719
(hard breathing)

1366
01:26:43.559 --> 01:26:46.420
Please. let Alan go.

1367
01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:48.500
He never asked to be
a part of any of this.

1368
01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:51.059
Kill me. do whatever you
want. Just let him go. please.

1369
01:26:51.059 --> 01:26:52.210
- Why would I kill you?

1370
01:26:56.070 --> 01:26:57.687
Now that I have you.

1371
01:27:01.370 --> 01:27:02.593
You're my baby brother.

1372
01:27:04.750 --> 01:27:05.873
You're home now.

1373
01:27:07.633 --> 01:27:09.653
- Are you gonna lock me in a room?

1374
01:27:11.092 --> 01:27:14.259
(soft dramatic music)

1375
01:27:17.139 --> 01:27:18.430
- Do you still love me?

1376
01:27:21.875 --> 01:27:22.992
- Yeah. I do.

1377
01:27:22.992 --> 01:27:26.159
(soft dramatic music)

1378
01:27:27.327 --> 01:27:28.161
- Good.

1379
01:27:31.573 --> 01:27:33.231
(dramatic music)

1380
01:27:33.231 --> 01:27:35.230
- What are you doing? No. no. no. Maggie.

1381
01:27:35.230 --> 01:27:36.063
- Stop. stop.

1382
01:27:36.063 --> 01:27:36.896
- Maggie no. no.

1383
01:27:36.896 --> 01:27:37.813
No. no. no.

1384
01:27:45.603 --> 01:27:46.436
Fuck.

1385
01:27:47.806 --> 01:27:49.191
Fuck!

1386
01:27:49.191 --> 01:27:52.358
(soft dramatic music)

1387
01:27:54.343 --> 01:27:55.175
No.

1388
01:27:57.262 --> 01:27:59.181
No no. no no. no.

1389
01:27:59.181 --> 01:28:00.598
- It's all right.

1390
01:28:01.465 --> 01:28:02.483
Hey. hey.

1391
01:28:02.483 --> 01:28:03.689
- No.
- Come on.

1392
01:28:03.689 --> 01:28:04.713
- No. no. no.

1393
01:28:04.713 --> 01:28:07.463
(hard breathing)

1394
01:28:09.812 --> 01:28:10.853
- Come on.

1395
01:28:10.853 --> 01:28:12.568
It's all right. it's all right.

1396
01:28:12.568 --> 01:28:13.702
Come on.

1397
01:28:13.702 --> 01:28:15.994
Here we go. Here we go. come on.

1398
01:28:15.994 --> 01:28:17.411
Come on. come on.

1399
01:28:20.742 --> 01:28:22.121
Help me up.

1400
01:28:22.121 --> 01:28:24.263
Come on. come on. come on.

1401
01:28:24.263 --> 01:28:25.180
Help me up.

1402
01:28:26.896 --> 01:28:29.835
(groaning)

1403
01:28:29.835 --> 01:28:33.003
(soft dramatic music)

1404
01:28:35.034 --> 01:28:37.568
- [Maggie] Remember me.

1405
01:28:37.568 --> 01:28:39.342
- It's all right. come on.

1406
01:28:39.342 --> 01:28:40.259
Here we go.

1407
01:28:43.611 --> 01:28:46.299
(crickets chirping)

1408
01:28:46.299 --> 01:28:47.132
It's okay.

1409
01:28:49.219 --> 01:28:51.636
I'm all right. I'm all right.

1410
01:28:53.496 --> 01:28:54.330
Oh yikes.

1411
01:28:55.657 --> 01:28:58.657
(crickets chirping)

1412
01:29:01.508 --> 01:29:03.862
(dog barking)

1413
01:29:03.862 --> 01:29:06.362
(owl hooting)

1414
01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:21.927
- Hey. that's the last of it?

1415
01:29:21.927 --> 01:29:23.120
- Yeah.

1416
01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:24.730
- Cool. now what do you say we do

1417
01:29:24.730 --> 01:29:26.639
a little pizza and beer tonight?

1418
01:29:26.639 --> 01:29:27.740
- That sounds amazing?

1419
01:29:28.930 --> 01:29:30.670
- I'll go hook us up.

1420
01:29:30.670 --> 01:29:33.074
- Hey. Alan.

1421
01:29:33.074 --> 01:29:33.907
- Huh?

1422
01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:37.960
- Thanks again for letting me stay.

1423
01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:39.248
I won't be a nuisance.

1424
01:29:39.248 --> 01:29:41.200
- Hey. hey hey.

1425
01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:42.500
I'm glad you're home. kid.

1426
01:29:45.412 --> 01:29:47.362
Maybe we finish Marie's puzzle tonight?

1427
01:29:50.407 --> 01:29:51.713
- Yeah. that'd be nice.

1428
01:29:52.910 --> 01:29:54.309
- I'll go hook the pizza up.

1429
01:29:55.195 --> 01:29:58.112
(soft piano music)

1430
01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:37.940
(soft music)
