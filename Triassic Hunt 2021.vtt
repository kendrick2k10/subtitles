Let'’s take it slow.

It'’s a little bit more
complicated than that.

How much more complicated?

Well. there'’s a reason for that.
We didn'’t want you here.

It wasn'’t your decision
to make. so I'’m here now.

you are to only use deadly
force as a last resort.

255

No. sir.

you are as deadly

every movement from here.

357
00:24:22.373 --> 00:24:25.072
but it is also
the biggest breakthrough

358
00:24:25.159 --> 00:24:30.599
in biological warfare since
the invention of gunpowder.

359
00:24:30.686 --> 00:24:31.992
No longer will nations
need to send...

360
00:24:32.079 --> 00:24:33.733
Oh. my God.

361
00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:35.648
...their young men and women
onto the battlefield

362
00:24:35.735 --> 00:24:38.564
to die for their
country or their cause.

363
00:24:38.651 --> 00:24:42.306
PTSD. collateral damage and
all the horrors of war

364
00:24:42.393 --> 00:24:45.919
and conflict will become
a relic of the past.

365
00:24:46.006 --> 00:24:49.270
Mr. Hagan. this is Dr. Ovidio.
our chief immunologist.

366
00:24:49.357 --> 00:24:52.142
He takes care of the animals and
make sure their organs

367
00:24:52.229 --> 00:24:53.709
are appropriate
for transplantation.

368
00:24:53.796 --> 00:24:56.146
Charles.

369
00:24:56.233 --> 00:25:01.412
This was all I ever wanted
when I was like nine years old.

370
00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:05.808
And now here you are

371
00:25:05.895 --> 00:25:08.289
after millions of
years of extinction.

372
00:25:08.376 --> 00:25:10.160
Don'’t get near it.

373
00:25:10.247 --> 00:25:12.859
No. it'’s okay.
This is G-48.

374
00:25:12.946 --> 00:25:16.906
She'’s actually responsible
for the whole G series.

375
00:25:16.993 --> 00:25:18.952
I have to admit. Marissa.
I was more than

376
00:25:19.039 --> 00:25:22.259
a little skeptical you had
real live dinosaurs here.

377
00:25:22.346 --> 00:25:24.610
That'’s why I had to come.

378
00:25:24.697 --> 00:25:28.396
I didn'’t believe it. but now...

379
00:25:28.483 --> 00:25:31.007
We make miracles happen
here every day.

380
00:25:32.922 --> 00:25:38.188
This miracle. my friend.
is our new and improved product.

381
00:25:38.275 --> 00:25:42.279
The bidding will start at
$500 million dollars each.

382
00:25:42.366 --> 00:25:43.933
We have two currently available.

383
00:25:46.806 --> 00:25:49.417
Why so expensive?

384
00:25:49.504 --> 00:25:52.725
You will be purchasing the
most ferocious combat soldiers

385
00:25:52.812 --> 00:25:55.162
to ever walk the face
of the earth

386
00:25:55.249 --> 00:25:57.773
unencumbered
by morality or ethics.

387
00:26:01.255 --> 00:26:06.216
Now we'’ve arranged a little
demonstration for you.

388
00:26:06.303 --> 00:26:09.045
I'’ve hired the most deadly
mercenaries that money can buy

389
00:26:09.132 --> 00:26:11.961
and pitted them against
our allosauruses.

390
00:26:12.048 --> 00:26:14.094
If you watch on your computer
screen. you will see live

391
00:26:14.181 --> 00:26:18.881
and in real time just how
valuable an asset this is.

392
00:26:18.968 --> 00:26:19.969
Enjoy the show.

393
00:26:31.067 --> 00:26:33.156
This place is creepy.

394
00:26:33.243 --> 00:26:34.854
Oh. it'’s old and quiet.

395
00:26:34.941 --> 00:26:36.856
Old and quiet is always creepy.

396
00:26:36.943 --> 00:26:38.684
It'’s not what I mean.

397
00:26:38.771 --> 00:26:42.470
It'’s empty. sitting
in the middle of nowhere.

398
00:26:42.557 --> 00:26:43.558
There'’s nothing here.

399
00:26:43.645 --> 00:26:46.605
Just us and those things.

400
00:26:47.997 --> 00:26:50.347
There!
Broken glass.

401
00:26:50.434 --> 00:26:51.610
We found something!

402
00:26:54.351 --> 00:26:55.788
They'’re here.

403
00:26:55.875 --> 00:26:57.006
How can you tell?

404
00:26:57.093 --> 00:27:00.488
These edges. they'’re fresh.

405
00:27:00.575 --> 00:27:02.098
If this glass
was broken any longer.

406
00:27:02.185 --> 00:27:04.144
then there'’d be dust and
dirt covering the edges.

407
00:27:04.231 --> 00:27:06.363
-Hmm.
-This is new.

408
00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:10.193
They'’re either inside
this building or they were.

409
00:27:15.634 --> 00:27:17.418
Be on the lookout.

410
00:27:22.684 --> 00:27:24.120
They tend to stick together.

411
00:27:24.207 --> 00:27:26.166
But that doesn'’t mean
they always will.

412
00:27:26.253 --> 00:27:28.777
But they usually hide where it'’s
dark and maybe a little damp.

413
00:27:28.864 --> 00:27:30.823
What do they want
with someplace dark and damp?

414
00:27:33.695 --> 00:27:37.177
They'’re nocturnal and that'’ll
remind them of the lab.

415
00:27:37.264 --> 00:27:39.135
They need to know.

416
00:27:39.222 --> 00:27:40.528
Know what?

417
00:27:40.615 --> 00:27:42.138
No. they don'’t.

418
00:27:42.225 --> 00:27:43.923
How much do you want to
keep from them just

419
00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:46.752
to protect secrets that
could help them to help us?

420
00:27:46.839 --> 00:27:49.624
Tell me.

421
00:27:49.711 --> 00:27:52.583
Uh. if there'’s something I need
to tell you that'’s important.

422
00:27:52.671 --> 00:27:54.542
I'’ll let you know.

423
00:27:54.629 --> 00:27:56.457
I decide what'’s important.

424
00:27:56.544 --> 00:27:57.850
That means
bringing your creatures

425
00:27:57.937 --> 00:27:59.982
back alive and
keeping my men safe!

426
00:28:00.069 --> 00:28:01.331
Now tell me!

427
00:28:04.117 --> 00:28:05.292
One of them is pregnant.

428
00:28:07.729 --> 00:28:09.731
And you weren'’t gonna
tell me this?

429
00:28:09.818 --> 00:28:11.124
Doesn'’t that make
the assets more valuable?

430
00:28:11.211 --> 00:28:13.082
Of course. it does.

431
00:28:13.169 --> 00:28:17.130
Transporting two allosauruses
to Costa Rica is tough enough.

432
00:28:17.217 --> 00:28:18.827
let alone two with an egg.

433
00:28:18.914 --> 00:28:20.089
An egg?

434
00:28:20.176 --> 00:28:21.569
No. not an egg.

435
00:28:21.656 --> 00:28:23.223
Nothing anyone has
even seen before.

436
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:26.182
We'’re talking about
life created from life

437
00:28:26.269 --> 00:28:28.054
that was created
in a petri dish.

438
00:28:28.141 --> 00:28:29.838
Don'’t you get it?

439
00:28:29.925 --> 00:28:35.539
Elaine has made dozens of them.
but they all failed.

440
00:28:35.626 --> 00:28:38.151
Sterile. they died.

441
00:28:38.238 --> 00:28:41.676
What this is is something the
world'’s never seen before.

442
00:28:41.763 --> 00:28:45.506
What? One that can get
another one pregnant?

443
00:28:45.593 --> 00:28:48.378
No. not just that.
Survivors.

444
00:28:48.465 --> 00:28:49.771
These are the only
two test subjects

445
00:28:49.858 --> 00:28:50.946
to ever leave
that building alive.

446
00:28:58.388 --> 00:29:00.173
Go for Deacon?

447
00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:01.304
Deacon here.

448
00:29:01.391 --> 00:29:03.872
One of them might be pregnant.

449
00:29:03.959 --> 00:29:06.614
That'’s supposed
to mean something?

450
00:29:06.701 --> 00:29:10.226
Mama bear.
Things could get hairy.

451
00:29:10.313 --> 00:29:11.575
Copy that.

452
00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:15.101
You okay?

453
00:29:15.188 --> 00:29:17.668
100%.

454
00:29:17.756 --> 00:29:19.279
You brought some
shit up earlier with Joy

455
00:29:19.366 --> 00:29:20.541
when you first saw her.

456
00:29:20.628 --> 00:29:22.673
I need you to be on your game.

457
00:29:22.761 --> 00:29:23.979
We'’re good.

458
00:29:25.764 --> 00:29:26.677
I'’m counting on it.

459
00:29:30.769 --> 00:29:31.900
Base. we got more blood.

460
00:29:33.989 --> 00:29:35.904
Go. Red Team!

461
00:29:35.991 --> 00:29:40.430
Same as before.
Lots of blood. no bodies.

462
00:29:40.517 --> 00:29:43.259
They'’re building a territory.
setting up their own perimeter.

463
00:29:43.346 --> 00:29:45.261
Like soldiers.

464
00:29:47.655 --> 00:29:49.700
More like wolves.

465
00:29:49.788 --> 00:29:51.441
Help me...

466
00:29:51.528 --> 00:29:53.574
I'’ve got a civilian! I repeat!
I got a civilian!

467
00:29:53.661 --> 00:29:55.141
He'’s down and needs
medic immediately!

468
00:29:56.490 --> 00:29:57.708
Wait. no. No. no. no.

469
00:29:57.796 --> 00:29:59.058
That doesn'’t make any sense.

470
00:29:59.145 --> 00:30:00.059
They wouldn'’t do that.

471
00:30:00.146 --> 00:30:01.625
What do you mean?

472
00:30:01.712 --> 00:30:03.062
They wouldn'’t have
left anyone there.

473
00:30:03.149 --> 00:30:04.150
They wouldn'’t have
left him alive.

474
00:30:04.237 --> 00:30:05.194
You'’ve seen this before?

475
00:30:07.631 --> 00:30:09.764
Red Team! Stand down!

476
00:30:09.851 --> 00:30:11.331
Back up and stand down!

477
00:30:11.418 --> 00:30:13.463
What? I said I'’ve got an
injured civilian!

478
00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:15.291
No. they'’re luring you in.
It'’s a trap!

479
00:30:15.378 --> 00:30:16.858
Red Team. fall back!

480
00:30:16.945 --> 00:30:19.339
That'’s an order.
fall back now!

481
00:30:19.426 --> 00:30:21.167
[ roaring ]

482
00:30:21.254 --> 00:30:22.995
Listen to me.
Get out of there now!

483
00:30:23.082 --> 00:30:25.954
Too late for that now. Sarge.

484
00:30:26.041 --> 00:30:27.129
[ roaring ]

485
00:30:28.261 --> 00:30:29.653
[ shouts ]

486
00:30:30.741 --> 00:30:32.178
Red Team. come in!

487
00:30:32.265 --> 00:30:33.570
Red Team. do you read me?

488
00:30:33.657 --> 00:30:35.137
Nick! Nick!
Do you hear me?

489
00:30:35.224 --> 00:30:36.399
Damn it!

490
00:30:42.101 --> 00:30:44.364
Base. Red Team clear.

491
00:30:44.451 --> 00:30:47.584
Not sure what happened. target
just stopped its pursuit.

492
00:30:47.671 --> 00:30:49.717
Copy that. Red Team.
And the civilian?

493
00:30:49.804 --> 00:30:52.546
Target took him.
snapped the guy'’s neck.

494
00:30:54.113 --> 00:30:55.766
Target'’s headed north.

495
00:30:55.854 --> 00:30:57.638
I'’m below.
Gordon'’s still above.

496
00:30:57.725 --> 00:31:00.554
Copy that. Red Team.
Gordon. check in.

497
00:31:00.641 --> 00:31:01.685
Nick. you good?

498
00:31:01.772 --> 00:31:04.036
-[ roaring ]
-Whoa!

499
00:31:04.123 --> 00:31:06.560
I got one.

500
00:31:06.647 --> 00:31:08.823
I'’m pinned
down behind some trash.

501
00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:10.259
Weapon'’s out of reach.

502
00:31:10.346 --> 00:31:12.218
Gordon. what'’s your twenty?

503
00:31:12.305 --> 00:31:13.828
I'’m at the tall building.
north of where I left you.

504
00:31:13.915 --> 00:31:16.135
Half a click.

505
00:31:16.222 --> 00:31:17.658
I'’ll be there.

506
00:31:17.745 --> 00:31:19.355
Gordon needs help.
He'’s pinned down.

507
00:31:19.442 --> 00:31:21.836
Hey. Gordon? Find something
to hide your scent.

508
00:31:21.923 --> 00:31:23.316
It'’ll be your best chance.

509
00:31:27.581 --> 00:31:28.582
I'’m on my way.

510
00:31:35.763 --> 00:31:37.896
Nick. take it nice and slow.

511
00:31:37.983 --> 00:31:39.549
Stay out of sight
and see if you can approach

512
00:31:39.636 --> 00:31:41.203
from around the back side.

513
00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:43.510
These dinosaurs have
excellent hearing.

514
00:31:43.597 --> 00:31:46.165
so keep your voice
low on comms.

515
00:31:46.252 --> 00:31:47.383
Copy that.

516
00:31:55.609 --> 00:31:57.350
I'’ve got eyes.

517
00:31:57.437 --> 00:31:58.917
I'’m just around the corner.

518
00:31:59.004 --> 00:32:01.528
Copy that.

519
00:32:01.615 --> 00:32:03.747
On the count of three.
we'’ll both jump out and fire.

520
00:32:03.834 --> 00:32:05.227
He'’ll be at your twelve.

521
00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:10.841
Three. two. one!

522
00:32:15.063 --> 00:32:17.152
Damn it.

523
00:32:17.239 --> 00:32:18.197
Where'’d it go?

524
00:32:20.851 --> 00:32:22.244
See it?

525
00:32:23.593 --> 00:32:25.160
Where the hell did it go?

526
00:32:25.247 --> 00:32:26.335
It'’s another trap.

527
00:32:26.422 --> 00:32:27.989
Are you kidding me?

528
00:32:28.076 --> 00:32:29.773
No. It'’s Ozzie.
He'’s protecting Harriet.

529
00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:30.861
What does that mean?

530
00:32:30.949 --> 00:32:32.689
He'’s the male.

531
00:32:32.776 --> 00:32:34.996
He'’s leading them away from
Harriet to keep her safe.

532
00:32:35.083 --> 00:32:36.258
He'’s gonna wait until
they'’re further away from her

533
00:32:36.345 --> 00:32:37.781
before he attacks again.

534
00:32:37.868 --> 00:32:40.523
Red Team. get out
of sight immediately!

535
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:42.873
You can'’t see the target.
but he sees you.

536
00:32:45.006 --> 00:32:46.573
Take cover and wait.

537
00:32:52.187 --> 00:32:53.797
[ roaring ]

538
00:32:53.884 --> 00:32:55.843
[ gunfire ]

539
00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:58.628
The tranqs don'’t work!
They'’re bouncing off his skin!

540
00:32:58.715 --> 00:33:00.195
Try shooting on the nose.

541
00:33:00.282 --> 00:33:01.501
It'’s the softest
part of the skin.

542
00:33:01.588 --> 00:33:03.285
Now you tell us that?

543
00:33:07.246 --> 00:33:09.639
We lost it.
It got away.

544
00:33:09.726 --> 00:33:11.815
What do you mean. you lost it?

545
00:33:11.902 --> 00:33:13.600
I mean we lost it.

546
00:33:13.687 --> 00:33:16.385
Target'’s on the move again.
headed southeast.

547
00:33:16.472 --> 00:33:17.473
Damn it!

548
00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:19.867
-Sarge?
-Yeah?

549
00:33:19.954 --> 00:33:21.869
I never seen anything
like that before.

550
00:33:21.956 --> 00:33:24.393
Those tranqs might as
well have been rock salt.

551
00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.221
Barely slowed it down.

552
00:33:26.308 --> 00:33:28.223
Copy that.
Watch your six.

553
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:29.703
Listen up. everyone.

554
00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:31.966
We aren'’t dealing
with grizzlies here.

555
00:33:32.053 --> 00:33:35.926
These are polar bear.
I repeat. these are polar bear.

556
00:33:36.014 --> 00:33:37.145
Copy that.

557
00:33:37.232 --> 00:33:38.886
What does that mean?

558
00:33:38.973 --> 00:33:40.801
A grizzly bear will do
anything to protect its cub

559
00:33:40.888 --> 00:33:42.368
and its territory.

560
00:33:42.455 --> 00:33:44.761
But they won'’t
actively hunt humans.

561
00:33:44.848 --> 00:33:46.154
And a polar bear?

562
00:33:46.241 --> 00:33:48.374
A polar bear is the only
animal that will

563
00:33:48.461 --> 00:33:50.724
actually hunt and eat humans.

564
00:33:59.211 --> 00:34:01.082
Blue Team. stay alert.

565
00:34:01.169 --> 00:34:02.866
We don'’t know where either
target could be hiding.

566
00:34:02.953 --> 00:34:05.347
-Copy that.
-Copy that.

567
00:34:05.434 --> 00:34:07.741
Gordon. which direction
did it head?

568
00:34:10.004 --> 00:34:12.528
Southeast toward the edge
of the perimeter.

569
00:34:12.615 --> 00:34:15.792
Can'’t see it.
That thing is fast and sneaky.

570
00:34:15.879 --> 00:34:17.577
I'’m all set here.

571
00:34:17.664 --> 00:34:20.058
Okay. I'’m going hunting.

572
00:34:20.145 --> 00:34:23.626
Oh. Nick. try not to get eaten.

573
00:34:23.713 --> 00:34:24.801
I'’ll try.

574
00:34:24.888 --> 00:34:26.629
Here.

575
00:34:26.716 --> 00:34:28.240
This is the midway point
between where we saw

576
00:34:28.327 --> 00:34:30.329
the broken glass and
where Red Team engaged.

577
00:34:30.416 --> 00:34:33.549
If one of them headed southeast.
this is the spot to cut it off.

578
00:34:36.335 --> 00:34:37.597
You'’re the tracker.

579
00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:45.648
I thought you were dead.

580
00:34:45.735 --> 00:34:47.041
What?

581
00:34:47.128 --> 00:34:50.479
Pakistan.
I thought they killed you.

582
00:34:50.566 --> 00:34:53.700
Is that why you
abandoned me there?

583
00:34:53.787 --> 00:34:55.093
I didn'’t abandon you.

584
00:34:58.183 --> 00:35:00.228
I mourned you.

585
00:35:00.315 --> 00:35:02.056
They sent me your dog tags.

586
00:35:02.143 --> 00:35:04.711
I didn'’t know a thing that
happened for six months.

587
00:35:04.798 --> 00:35:06.191
And even then.
you didn'’t reach out.

588
00:35:06.278 --> 00:35:08.236
I couldn'’t.
We had our orders.

589
00:35:08.323 --> 00:35:09.542
There was a reason
it was a two-person crew.

590
00:35:09.629 --> 00:35:11.196
and it was
to keep things quiet.

591
00:35:11.283 --> 00:35:13.154
We couldn'’t even
contact our team.

592
00:35:13.241 --> 00:35:15.722
Yeah. but I did and
that'’s how I got out of there.

593
00:35:15.809 --> 00:35:18.072
They got me out
when you left me for dead.

594
00:35:19.682 --> 00:35:20.596
Karl?

595
00:35:23.164 --> 00:35:25.340
I thought you knew me
better than that.

596
00:35:25.427 --> 00:35:27.125
I know that you and
I made the same mistake

597
00:35:27.212 --> 00:35:28.909
that nearly got me wiped out

598
00:35:28.996 --> 00:35:31.346
and you thinking
for six months that I was dead.

599
00:35:31.433 --> 00:35:34.132
You and I got too close.

600
00:35:34.219 --> 00:35:35.133
Yes. we did.

601
00:35:36.612 --> 00:35:38.048
I'’ll not make
that mistake again.

602
00:35:41.878 --> 00:35:44.011
And I want my dog tags back!

603
00:35:44.098 --> 00:35:45.578
Those were supposed
to go to my mother.

604
00:35:45.665 --> 00:35:47.275
-You know what--
-Hey!

605
00:35:47.362 --> 00:35:49.147
You two knock it off.
We'’re not here for this.

606
00:35:49.234 --> 00:35:51.627
We'’re here to catch
dinosaurs.

607
00:35:51.714 --> 00:35:54.456
All right. listen up.

608
00:35:54.543 --> 00:35:56.719
Look for the chalk markings
on the buildings.

609
00:35:56.806 --> 00:36:00.158
X means trip wire.
O means motion sensor.

610
00:36:00.245 --> 00:36:01.594
Got you.

611
00:36:01.681 --> 00:36:03.117
Mind the X.

612
00:36:18.176 --> 00:36:19.916
I have a visual.

613
00:36:20.003 --> 00:36:21.440
Take the shot. Gordon.

614
00:36:21.527 --> 00:36:24.399
Aim for its neck.
Softer tissue.

615
00:36:24.486 --> 00:36:25.922
Don'’t kill it. sniper!

616
00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:33.713
Got it!

617
00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:35.671
Oh. please tell me you
used tranquilizer.

618
00:36:35.758 --> 00:36:37.978
That'’s a negative.
I used all my tranqs.

619
00:36:38.065 --> 00:36:41.024
Oh. God.
Status report now.

620
00:36:41.111 --> 00:36:42.548
On our way.

621
00:36:48.249 --> 00:36:49.990
They said the tranqs don'’t work.

622
00:36:50.077 --> 00:36:52.035
No. They said to shoot
it in the nose.

623
00:36:52.122 --> 00:36:53.863
Yeah.

624
00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:56.649
Maybe I can shoot through
the eye with a tranq?

625
00:36:56.736 --> 00:36:58.041
You should not get that close.

626
00:36:59.347 --> 00:37:02.220
How close is too close?

627
00:37:02.307 --> 00:37:04.744
I think my incident at the
garbage was a field test.

628
00:37:04.831 --> 00:37:05.745
You telling me
we don'’t know what it takes

629
00:37:05.832 --> 00:37:07.486
to take these down?

630
00:37:07.573 --> 00:37:11.141
I mean. it'’s not moving.
It'’s probably dead.

631
00:37:11.229 --> 00:37:13.318
Plug it a few times
just to be sure.

632
00:37:18.627 --> 00:37:19.846
What if it'’s playing dead?

633
00:37:19.933 --> 00:37:21.761
Would it do that?

I'’m not sure
I want to get any closer.

Not the time to get
cold feet. Deacon.

637
00:37:29.943 --> 00:37:31.597
We need to bag this thing
so we can go home.

638

We have to leave him if we'’re
going to get them later.

Damn it.

00:38:28.567 --> 00:38:30.612
It'’s V!

652
00:38:30.699 --> 00:38:34.529
The mercs are dropping and
they'’ve hardly made a dent.

653
00:38:34.616 --> 00:38:37.315
Yeah. it'’s happening faster
than I thought.

654
00:38:37.402 --> 00:38:38.751
She'’s ahead of schedule.

655
00:38:38.838 --> 00:38:40.492
Pick up the pace.

656
00:38:40.579 --> 00:38:43.016
Yeah. it means she'’s gonna
be much more angry

657
00:38:43.103 --> 00:38:44.670
and much more protective.

658
00:38:44.757 --> 00:38:48.108
All right.
Keep me informed. I gotta go.

659
00:38:48.195 --> 00:38:50.502
Will do. Bye.

660
00:38:54.244 --> 00:38:58.074
As you can see. we'’ve lost
our first mercenary.

661
00:38:58.161 --> 00:39:00.773
And the current bid.
$650 million.

662
00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:02.383
I hope you have
an underwriter for that.

663
00:39:04.864 --> 00:39:06.561
$700 million.

664
00:39:14.613 --> 00:39:16.354
What'’s going on?

665
00:39:16.441 --> 00:39:17.485
Nothing.

666
00:39:18.617 --> 00:39:19.531
What?

667
00:39:22.098 --> 00:39:24.231
Your team might
not have everything.

668
00:39:24.318 --> 00:39:25.537
What do you mean?

669
00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:30.063
I mean. there might
be a failsafe.

670
00:39:32.848 --> 00:39:34.241
Are you kidding me?

671
00:39:34.328 --> 00:39:36.025
It isn'’t guaranteed to work.

672
00:39:37.679 --> 00:39:39.594
What kind of failsafe?

673
00:39:39.681 --> 00:39:42.728
During the embryonic stage.
we implanted a microdot.

674
00:39:42.815 --> 00:39:46.514
of C4 activated by an
electronic receiver.

675
00:39:46.601 --> 00:39:48.777
C4. as in explosives?

676
00:39:48.864 --> 00:39:50.692
Right.

677
00:39:50.779 --> 00:39:51.693
Where?

678
00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:53.956
The brain.

679
00:39:54.043 --> 00:39:56.829
They have a bomb in the brain?

680
00:39:56.916 --> 00:39:58.918
Yes. but that was before
they had any real value.

681
00:39:59.005 --> 00:40:00.876
Now that we know
they can conceive.

682
00:40:00.963 --> 00:40:03.792
they'’re worth 10 times the
amount that was anticipated.

683
00:40:03.879 --> 00:40:06.360
And you were just told
to forget about this?

684
00:40:06.447 --> 00:40:08.144
Yes.

685
00:40:08.231 --> 00:40:09.842
Tell them. or we walk.

686
00:40:09.929 --> 00:40:11.800
and you bring in
someone else to clean up.

687
00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:14.673
Team?

688
00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:16.501
-Red Team. go.
-Blue Team. go.

689
00:40:16.588 --> 00:40:19.112
Simone needs to be told first.

690
00:40:19.199 --> 00:40:21.984
Told what first?

691
00:40:22.071 --> 00:40:25.727
When were you gonna tell me that
they have bombs in their brains?

692
00:40:25.814 --> 00:40:27.686
Hopefully. never.

693
00:40:27.773 --> 00:40:29.862
They need to know
there'’s a failsafe.

694
00:40:29.949 --> 00:40:31.994
That was put in
before we knew

695
00:40:32.081 --> 00:40:33.343
the potential of
these creatures.

696
00:40:33.431 --> 00:40:35.128
So?

697
00:40:35.215 --> 00:40:38.305
Unless absolutely necessary.
we don'’t tell them.

698
00:40:38.392 --> 00:40:41.656
It'’s too late.

699
00:40:41.743 --> 00:40:45.007
Copy that.
Bomb in the brain.

700
00:40:45.094 --> 00:40:47.401
Well. it doesn'’t matter.
We haven'’t tested it.

701
00:40:47.488 --> 00:40:49.316
We don'’t even know if it works.

702
00:40:49.403 --> 00:40:53.451
There is a password and radio
frequency as a last resort.

703
00:40:53.538 --> 00:40:57.455
But this is not it.
This is not the last resort.

704
00:40:57.542 --> 00:40:59.848
Now continue your sweep.

705
00:40:59.935 --> 00:41:01.676
Is there anything else
I need to know?

706
00:41:01.763 --> 00:41:04.200
You didn'’t even
need to know that.

707
00:41:04.287 --> 00:41:06.594
Screw you and your bank account.

708
00:41:08.378 --> 00:41:09.467
Give it to them.

709
00:41:14.689 --> 00:41:16.343

00:54:22.171 --> 00:54:23.738
They are gonna wait until night

and then they are gonna
pick us off one by one.

00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:28.569

where there'’s easier
prey to get.

894
00:54:30.919 --> 00:54:32.834
And they'’ll eat
their way through it.

They know what we'’re doing

We have the female.
It is not the male.

00:57:16.694 --> 00:57:17.782
How smart?

00:57:19.697 --> 00:57:21.786
During the embryo phase
when we were experimenting

with the prefrontal lobe.

956
00:57:23.701 --> 00:57:25.790
we managed to increase
the size of the cerebral cortex

00:57:25.877 --> 00:57:27.182
to that of a human'’s.

958
00:57:27.269 --> 00:57:30.098
What does that mean?

959
00:57:30.185 --> 00:57:34.755
It means we made him smart. but
they exceeded our expectations.

960
00:57:34.842 --> 00:57:36.409
We didn'’t count on the fact

961
00:57:36.496 --> 00:57:38.629
that they would learn
and adapt so quickly.

962
00:57:38.716 --> 00:57:42.981
They became highly efficient
practically overnight.

00:57:43.068 --> 00:57:45.418

to the point where

00:57:53.644 --> 00:57:55.950
they started using
complex deception

to herd the humans where
they wanted them.

the initial onslaught

The dinosaurs adapted
so quickly.

at deception and manipulation

almost instantly.

I tracked it to Deacon.

want us to go.

ended up growing too.

It means their fight
or flight response

00:58:43.868 --> 00:58:45.434

their intelligence.

1004

battlefield scenarios.

we'’re the field test?

We were only called in because
the transport went sour.

I found this after
the truck crashed

But he wouldn'’t carry any
thing like this.

1039
01:01:23.984 --> 01:01:25.116
He'’s never dealt
with explosives.

This is what is left if a small
receiver for an explosion.

You blew up their cages and
you didn'’t even sedate them.

1043
01:01:39.173 --> 01:01:42.089
Would you send your soldiers
into battle sedated?

You'’ve got plenty
of blood on your hands.

1047
01:01:48.443 --> 01:01:50.141
You knew about all this.

1048
01:01:50.228 --> 01:01:52.709
This industrial park?
This is all yours.

1049

Simone: Yep. we own it.

1050
01:01:55.712 --> 01:01:57.061
This is all by design.

1051
01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.197
But what if it didn'’t fail?

1052
01:02:03.284 --> 01:02:05.547
What if you actually
succeeded doing all this?

1053
01:02:05.634 --> 01:02:07.071
It wasn'’t part of the plan.

1054
01:02:07.158 --> 01:02:08.899
You were always the B team.

1055
01:02:08.986 --> 01:02:12.380
What does that mean?

1056
01:02:12.467 --> 01:02:14.252
It means we were never supposed to walk out of here.

1057
01:02:14.339 --> 01:02:17.995
I'’m guessing a
drone strike?

1058
01:02:18.082 --> 01:02:20.737
We used the same tactic on
a decoy mission in Beirut.

1059
01:02:20.824 --> 01:02:22.434
It didn'’t work out then.

1060
01:02:22.521 --> 01:02:24.653
At this point.
we need to finish the job.

1061
01:02:24.741 --> 01:02:26.699
or none of us
walks away from here alive.

1062
01:02:26.786 --> 01:02:28.701
I have to check on something.

1063
01:02:28.788 --> 01:02:31.791
Those dinosaurs could have
easily torn us out of that van.

1064
01:02:31.878 --> 01:02:33.401
I want to know why they didn'’t.

1065
01:02:34.576 --> 01:02:36.317
I get it now.

01:02:36.404 --> 01:02:38.276
It'’s where they don'’t
want us to be.

01:02:38.363 --> 01:02:41.105
-Nick. where are you going?
-Are you out of your mind?

1068
01:02:59.601 --> 01:03:02.256
Gordon. you got two rounds left?
I need cover.

01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:06.521
You'’re crazy to be
out there. amigo.

1074
01:03:53.612 --> 01:03:56.093
The dinosaurs were listening.

1075
01:03:56.180 --> 01:03:58.747
They have Deacon'’s comm unit.

1076
01:03:58.835 --> 01:04:00.532
They heard everything
we were saying.

1077
01:04:00.619 --> 01:04:03.361
They know where we were
because we told them.

1078
01:04:05.319 --> 01:04:06.886
That'’s why I thought
Deacon was alive.

1079
01:04:08.409 --> 01:04:11.369
His comm wasn'’t even
near his body.

1080
01:04:11.456 --> 01:04:14.067
They turned it on
to lure us to him.

1081
01:04:14.154 --> 01:04:16.635
This is better than
I could have ever imagined.

1082
01:04:16.722 --> 01:04:18.506
They can understand us?

1083
01:04:26.297 --> 01:04:28.690

1084
01:04:28.777 --> 01:04:30.475

Do you even know
what'’s in these buildings?

No. What?

1100
01:05:48.379 --> 01:05:49.946
Ammonia Nitrate!

1101
01:05:50.033 --> 01:05:52.035
It'’s the same stuff that
blew the hole in Beirut!

1102
01:05:52.122 --> 01:05:54.385
If you blow the C4.
it will activate the chemical

1103

and blow up half the state!

1104
01:05:56.343 --> 01:05:58.476

01:05:58.563 --> 01:06:00.304
No.

Karl. abort!

1108
01:06:06.223 --> 01:06:07.964
It was a pleasure
working with all of you.

Karl. come in!

1111
01:06:14.971 --> 01:06:17.930
Did he turn it off?

1112
01:06:18.017 --> 01:06:20.367
Unsure.

1113
01:06:20.454 --> 01:06:21.542

01:06:26.504 --> 01:06:28.636
The Oxen Valley plant.
It'’s only five miles from here.

1117
01:06:28.723 --> 01:06:29.768
It'’s in the blast zone.

1118
01:06:29.855 --> 01:06:31.074
Oxen Valley?

1119
01:06:31.161 --> 01:06:32.205
It'’s a nuclear power plant.

Jeez.

1121
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:36.035
Somebody has to get up there
and stop that signal

1122
01:06:36.122 --> 01:06:37.776

and kills us all!

to watch my six.

What about the one on your six?

1150
01:07:43.276 --> 01:07:45.452
It retreated back
towards the van.

1151
01:07:45.539 --> 01:07:47.280
We got lucky with this one.

1152
01:07:47.367 --> 01:07:50.762
But I don'’t think
Karl messed up.

1153
01:07:50.849 --> 01:07:52.024

1154
01:07:53.721 --> 01:07:55.462

it shouldn'’t have worked.

Drone strike.

No. Us.

and better.

will be solved in the van.

1178
01:09:06.359 --> 01:09:07.882
Can you get there?

1179
01:09:07.969 --> 01:09:11.538
To the van? Yeah.
What am I looking for?

1180
01:09:11.625 --> 01:09:14.498
We were in the van
they didn'’t attack us

1181
01:09:14.585 --> 01:09:17.631
because they hid
their egg in the van.

1182
01:09:17.718 --> 01:09:22.462
Joy. I want you in and out of
there as fast as possible!

1183
01:09:22.549 --> 01:09:24.421
These dinosaurs
have been one step ahead of us

1184
01:09:24.508 --> 01:09:27.598
this entire time.
It might just be a trap!

1185
01:09:27.685 --> 01:09:30.557
Joy. I know I don'’t have
to tell you how valuable

1186
01:09:30.644 --> 01:09:33.169
that egg is or what
those dinosaurs will do to you

1187
01:09:33.256 --> 01:09:34.735
if they catch you
trying to take it.

1188
01:09:36.607 --> 01:09:37.564
Copy that.

1189
01:09:59.151 --> 01:10:00.631
I'’m back in the van.

1190
01:10:00.718 --> 01:10:03.373
Nick was right.
The egg is here.

1191
01:10:09.074 --> 01:10:10.989
Joy. listen to me.

1192
01:10:11.076 --> 01:10:12.730
You can'’t fool them twice.

1193
01:10:12.817 --> 01:10:14.514
They learn.
Do you understand?

1194
01:10:14.601 --> 01:10:17.169
They will kill you.
You need to get out of there!

1195
01:10:18.692 --> 01:10:20.955
What happened to the
experiment at Triassic?

1196
01:10:21.042 --> 01:10:23.306
Were there any survivors?

1197
01:10:23.393 --> 01:10:26.047
Yes. Two.

1198
01:10:26.134 --> 01:10:27.832
But every other warm body
in the facility

1199
01:10:27.919 --> 01:10:32.053
was systematically
picked off one by one.

1200
01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:33.707
It wasn'’t just
that the dinosaurs

1201
01:10:33.794 --> 01:10:35.361
got loose and attacked.

1202
01:10:35.448 --> 01:10:37.233
They planned it.

1203
01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:39.800
They studied us while we
were studying them.

1204
01:10:39.887 --> 01:10:43.326
They learned our schedules
and our protocols.

1205
01:10:43.413 --> 01:10:46.851
They waited for the
right moment to escape.

1206
01:10:46.938 --> 01:10:49.897
They were always
one step ahead of us.

1207
01:10:49.984 --> 01:10:52.248
They didn'’t just
want to get out.

1208
01:10:52.335 --> 01:10:55.120
They wanted to hunt.

1209
01:10:55.207 --> 01:10:57.253
They wanted to kill.

1210
01:10:57.340 --> 01:11:00.691
They could have escaped sooner
and never have been caught.

1211
01:11:00.778 --> 01:11:03.128
But it wasn'’t just about
survival for them.

1212
01:11:03.215 --> 01:11:05.435
It was personal.

1213
01:11:05.522 --> 01:11:08.002
It was a massacre.

1214
01:11:08.089 --> 01:11:11.310
That anyone made it out
alive was just dumb luck.

1215
01:11:11.397 --> 01:11:14.661
The fact that two people
did is a miracle.

1216
01:11:14.748 --> 01:11:17.011
The second survivor was
a lab assistant.

1217
01:11:17.098 --> 01:11:21.668
She suffered such trauma from
it all. she just disappeared.

1218
01:11:21.755 --> 01:11:23.714
They say she'’s like a hermit
living out in the middle

1219
01:11:23.801 --> 01:11:25.542
of the woods somewhere.

1220
01:11:25.629 --> 01:11:28.849
And all she does is talk about
revenge against all of us

1221
01:11:28.936 --> 01:11:30.982
and everything we created.

1222
01:11:31.069 --> 01:11:32.679
Wouldn'’t you?

1223
01:11:32.766 --> 01:11:34.855
Several corporations
went down in flames

1224
01:11:34.942 --> 01:11:37.031
and much of it
is attributed to her.

1225
01:11:44.778 --> 01:11:46.737
But it was important for us
to keep trying

1226
01:11:46.824 --> 01:11:49.435
and learn from their mistakes.

1227
01:11:49.522 --> 01:11:53.439

1228
01:11:53.526 --> 01:11:55.223
You want this. don'’t you?

1229
01:11:57.051 --> 01:11:58.879
I don'’t think so.
