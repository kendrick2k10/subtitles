00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.205
The third woman missing
from city streets this month

4
00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:34.639
has been identified

5
00:03:34.672 --> 00:03:37.109
as 23-year-old
Danielle Stonewalker.

6
00:03:37.143 --> 00:03:38.643
Stonewalker...

7
00:03:40.678 --> 00:03:42.114
I worry about you sometimes.
Lakota.

8
00:03:42.148 --> 00:03:44.649
You knows. there's all these
women disappearing.

9
00:03:44.682 --> 00:03:48.254
and the cops.
they don't do nothin'.

10
00:03:48.287 --> 00:03:49.989
Shit.

11
00:03:50.022 --> 00:03:52.058
Language. Lakota!

12
00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:54.635
You ain't got to worry
about me. neechie.

13
00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:55.895
I got my girls looking out.

14
00:03:55.928 --> 00:03:58.197
And most important. I got me.

15
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.666
And what did I tell you
about playing with that in here?

16
00:04:02.935 --> 00:04:04.636
I need both of you
on the red path

17
00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:06.771
and to realize your purpose.

18
00:04:06.805 --> 00:04:08.841
I'm not going to be
around here forever.

19
00:04:08.874 --> 00:04:09.842
Sure you are. Kôhkom.

20
00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:12.178
And what path are you on.
dear grandmother?

21
00:04:12.211 --> 00:04:14.213
Why aren't you gonna go see
a real doctor?

22
00:04:14.246 --> 00:04:16.348
This voodoo magic crap
isn't gonna work.

23
00:04:16.382 --> 00:04:17.816
You need real medicine.

24
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.019
What I need is to reconnect
with our roots

25
00:04:20.052 --> 00:04:21.187
in the traditional ways.

26
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.789
That's where true power
and real healing comes from.

27
00:04:24.823 --> 00:04:29.161
And I need you and Derrick
on this journey too.

28
00:04:29.195 --> 00:04:31.230
Gotta meet some friends
at the library. Kôhkom.

29
00:04:31.263 --> 00:04:32.630
Big test coming up.

30
00:04:32.664 --> 00:04:34.967
Lots of studying.

31
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.702
See you later! Love you.

32
00:04:37.735 --> 00:04:41.173
Make sure you make it
to your classes today!

33
00:05:03.429 --> 00:05:06.832
You remind me a lot
of your father.

34
00:05:06.866 --> 00:05:10.369
Ron had the most amazing
ear for music.

35
00:05:10.402 --> 00:05:13.738
He was a natural. just like you.

36
00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:15.074
Yeah. Kôhkom. I know.

37
00:05:15.107 --> 00:05:19.811
He was a great player. and...

38
00:05:19.845 --> 00:05:23.215
the best son
a mother could ever have.

39
00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:26.018
But now you got me.

40
00:05:26.051 --> 00:05:29.121
The best grandson
you could ever have.

41
00:05:29.155 --> 00:05:33.225
and best of all is.

42
00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:34.827
I'm not leaving.

43
00:05:37.795 --> 00:05:39.398
I'm very sick.

44
00:05:39.431 --> 00:05:41.834
I might be the one leaving.

45
00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.042
Hey.

46
00:05:53.811 --> 00:05:55.881
I love you so much. Kôhkom.

47
00:06:00.085 --> 00:06:01.954
But...

48
00:06:01.987 --> 00:06:04.190
I don't know what to do
to make you better.

49
00:06:08.093 --> 00:06:12.064
You have great gifts
and a special purpose. Derrick.

50
00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:18.404
I want you to come
to Saddle Lake with me

51
00:06:18.437 --> 00:06:20.805
to see the medicine man.

52
00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:23.008
And he needs a new apprentice.

53
00:06:23.042 --> 00:06:26.445
No. I-I don't wanna go.

54
00:06:26.478 --> 00:06:31.350
I know you're scared
and unsure about your talents.

55
00:06:31.383 --> 00:06:34.987
But that's to be expected
from a boy your age.

56
00:06:38.123 --> 00:06:40.926
Anyway. I see things. you know.

57
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.296
dark things sometimes.

58
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.434
Just like the bad dreams
you had when you were little.

59
00:06:48.467 --> 00:06:53.239
You remember what I taught you?

60
00:06:53.272 --> 00:06:54.473
Yes. Kôhkom.

61
00:06:56.408 --> 00:06:59.245
That's it's my dream

62
00:06:59.278 --> 00:07:01.847
and I am in control.

63
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.782
And I can make it
the way I want it.

64
00:07:04.816 --> 00:07:06.352
Exactly!

65
00:07:09.021 --> 00:07:12.024
Now. Time for a quick smudge
before school.

66
00:07:12.057 --> 00:07:14.560
to clear away
all the negative energy

67
00:07:14.593 --> 00:07:17.930
and make room for
some of the good stuff.

68
00:07:49.061 --> 00:07:53.565
Go back or die...

69
00:07:53.599 --> 00:07:59.438
Go back or die!

70
00:07:59.471 --> 00:08:00.472
Derrick!

71
00:08:00.506 --> 00:08:01.940
Are you okay?

72
00:08:07.346 --> 00:08:11.884
I thought I saw something.
but...

73
00:08:11.917 --> 00:08:14.153
it was probably...
it was probably nothing.

74
00:08:14.186 --> 00:08:16.588
When you were younger
and my little boy.

75
00:08:16.622 --> 00:08:19.892
I thought I could keep you safe.

76
00:08:19.925 --> 00:08:22.328
But that time is gone.

77
00:08:22.361 --> 00:08:26.065
Soon. you will be a man
and need a new teacher.

78
00:08:26.098 --> 00:08:27.499
But I don't want a new teacher!

79
00:08:27.533 --> 00:08:29.435
All is need is you and Lakota.

80
00:08:29.468 --> 00:08:33.472
The boy must die
to become a man.

81
00:08:33.505 --> 00:08:36.275
And I'm serious about you
coming to Saddle Lake.

82
00:08:36.308 --> 00:08:38.410
It'll be just
for a little while.

83
00:08:38.444 --> 00:08:40.012
But the band!

84
00:08:40.045 --> 00:08:42.915
The band will be here
when you get back.

85
00:08:42.948 --> 00:08:45.117
And school?

86
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.320
I thought you hated school.

87
00:08:48.354 --> 00:08:52.224
And besides. you can take
your schoolwork with you.

88
00:08:52.257 --> 00:08:55.527
I already talked to Mr. Turner
about it.

89
00:08:57.629 --> 00:09:01.633
But we haven't left yet.
and you'll miss your bus.

90
00:09:01.667 --> 00:09:04.103
No more Indian time for you.

91
00:09:08.507 --> 00:09:09.508
Hey. come on. baby.

92
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:10.943
There's no need for that.

93
00:09:10.976 --> 00:09:12.311
Give us a little taste.

94
00:09:13.445 --> 00:09:16.482
Go play with yourself already
and leave me alone!

95
00:09:16.515 --> 00:09:20.486
Listen to the dirty mouth
on this one.

96
00:09:20.519 --> 00:09:21.353
Stop!

97
00:09:21.387 --> 00:09:24.056
I don't think she's interested.

98
00:09:25.491 --> 00:09:27.226
Why don't you find
someone who is?

99
00:09:29.461 --> 00:09:30.396
My God.

100
00:09:30.429 --> 00:09:32.331
Aww.

101
00:09:32.364 --> 00:09:34.633
Don't you dirty Indians
believe in bathing?

102
00:09:34.666 --> 00:09:35.434
You smell like you just got back

103
00:09:35.467 --> 00:09:37.669
from cooking a squirrel
on the fire.

104
00:09:39.538 --> 00:09:42.274
Beat it. Tonto!

105
00:09:42.307 --> 00:09:43.307
Are you deaf...

106
00:09:47.112 --> 00:09:49.281
Let's go. handsome.
we gotta go now!

107
00:10:09.735 --> 00:10:11.136
Hey. Lakota.

108
00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:13.305
I saw your brother
at school this morning.

109
00:10:13.338 --> 00:10:16.208
Um. he helped save me
from those two greasy lebs.

110
00:10:16.241 --> 00:10:17.342
- Derrick?
- Mm-hm.

111
00:10:17.376 --> 00:10:20.379
My Derrick saved you from
those two pieces of shit?

112
00:10:20.412 --> 00:10:21.313
Sure did.

113
00:10:21.346 --> 00:10:24.583
And he's pretty cute. too.

114
00:10:24.616 --> 00:10:27.619
Never really got a chance
to say thank you properly.

115
00:10:30.355 --> 00:10:32.458
Sure he wouldn't say no. Traci.

116
00:10:36.628 --> 00:10:38.297
I keep offering.

117
00:10:42.367 --> 00:10:44.369
Pretty good score
at the park today. Lisa.

118
00:10:44.403 --> 00:10:47.539
Buddy bought almost a whole load
in one shot.

119
00:10:47.573 --> 00:10:50.075
That little rookie cop
is being a pain. though.

120
00:10:50.108 --> 00:10:52.744
She followed me
right out of the park.

121
00:10:52.778 --> 00:10:54.713
Might have to do something
about her.

122
00:10:54.746 --> 00:10:55.747
Michelle!

123
00:10:58.650 --> 00:10:59.518
What's up. boss?

124
00:10:59.551 --> 00:11:03.021
That little blonde piglet.
the new one?

125
00:11:03.055 --> 00:11:06.625
She's officially become
a real problem.

126
00:11:06.658 --> 00:11:09.094
And you're just dumb enough
to bring her here.

127
00:11:09.127 --> 00:11:11.063
ain't you. princess?

128
00:11:11.096 --> 00:11:12.364
I lost her a few blocks back.

129
00:11:12.397 --> 00:11:14.233
She's making it hard
to do business.

130
00:11:15.534 --> 00:11:19.104
Must be so hard
being stupid and a bitch.

131
00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:20.539
Maybe for you. breadbox.

132
00:11:22.241 --> 00:11:24.276
We're gonna fix this. Mich.

133
00:11:24.309 --> 00:11:26.545
Kota's my best earner.

134
00:11:26.578 --> 00:11:29.581
Make sure that cop finds
somewhere else to be.

135
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:32.651
Told you never to call me that.

136
00:11:32.684 --> 00:11:36.455
Quit being such a hard-on
all the time. Mich! Here.

137
00:11:36.488 --> 00:11:39.258
Have a drink.

138
00:11:40.827 --> 00:11:42.394
I need a refuel.

139
00:11:42.427 --> 00:11:44.796
You know.
you could be nicer to her.

140
00:11:44.831 --> 00:11:47.733
It's not my fault she always
has a yeast infection.

141
00:11:50.302 --> 00:11:51.637
Off to Rock Central Station.

142
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.106
Gonna be a busy one.

143
00:11:54.139 --> 00:11:56.275
Be extra careful out there.
Kota.

144
00:12:19.631 --> 00:12:20.631
Hi.

145
00:12:28.473 --> 00:12:30.175
What the hell
are you doing here?

146
00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:33.245
I'm gonna be playing right away.

147
00:12:33.278 --> 00:12:35.848
What the hell
are you doing here?

148
00:12:35.882 --> 00:12:38.650
I'm just picking up some money
and old friend of mine owes me.

149
00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.454
You're under 18.

150
00:12:42.487 --> 00:12:45.290
You and the bar could get
in a lot of trouble.

151
00:12:45.324 --> 00:12:46.291
It's not like I'm drinking.

152
00:12:46.325 --> 00:12:48.527
I just came here to play.

153
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.866
Hey. everyone.
thanks for coming out.

154
00:12:54.901 --> 00:12:56.468
We are Centerfuge

155
00:12:56.501 --> 00:12:58.503
and came all the way
from the Big Apple

156
00:12:58.537 --> 00:13:00.772
to kick some ass!

157
00:13:03.508 --> 00:13:04.877
"The Big Apple"?

158
00:13:04.911 --> 00:13:08.280
Whatever. It's not like
they know the difference.

159
00:13:30.937 --> 00:13:35.340
♪ I got some money in the bank ♪

160
00:13:35.374 --> 00:13:40.412
♪ The kind I cannot spend ♪

161
00:13:40.445 --> 00:13:45.384
♪ I'm saving it
for that rainy day ♪

162
00:13:48.921 --> 00:13:53.425
♪ But I'm all shook up ♪

163
00:13:53.458 --> 00:13:57.562
♪ I been feeling low ♪

164
00:14:01.266 --> 00:14:03.201
I finally got you.

165
00:14:03.235 --> 00:14:05.470
This is gonna be sweet.

166
00:14:05.504 --> 00:14:07.372
I don't know what
you're referring to. Officer.

167
00:14:07.406 --> 00:14:08.674
I'm here to see the band play.

168
00:14:08.707 --> 00:14:11.209
- I love live music.
- Turn around.

169
00:14:11.243 --> 00:14:13.545
Face the wall.

170
00:14:13.578 --> 00:14:14.680
Spread 'em.

171
00:14:46.411 --> 00:14:50.482
Not gonna cough up that dope.

172
00:14:50.515 --> 00:14:55.454
When you mess up. and you will.

173
00:14:55.487 --> 00:14:57.857
you're gonna go down.

174
00:15:07.766 --> 00:15:11.570
I better not see you
around here again. Sampson.

175
00:15:40.799 --> 00:15:43.368
Do you have any idea
what time it is?

176
00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:44.469
This is a school night.

177
00:15:44.503 --> 00:15:47.907
And you. you were supposed
to be in bed hours ago.

178
00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:48.875
That's it.

179
00:15:48.908 --> 00:15:51.043
I'm nailing those windows shut
this time.

180
00:15:51.077 --> 00:15:53.445
Come on. Kôhkom. don't be a...

181
00:15:53.478 --> 00:15:54.746
What Derrick meant to say was

182
00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.782
we are both very sorry
for being out late.

183
00:15:56.815 --> 00:15:59.417
And I had a gig
and it went great.

184
00:15:59.451 --> 00:16:00.853
You know? And I got paid. too.

185
00:16:00.887 --> 00:16:04.023
Three hundred bucks.
tax free. you know?

186
00:16:04.056 --> 00:16:07.325
That's... that's pretty good. eh?

187
00:16:08.593 --> 00:16:15.067
To help pay for rent and...
everything else.

188
00:16:15.101 --> 00:16:17.937
Derrick. I know you were
wonderful tonight.

189
00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:19.005
Thank you.

190
00:16:19.038 --> 00:16:22.440
I need you to go upstairs
and get ready for bed.

191
00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:36.856
I want to talk with you.

192
00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:38.557
We haven't talked in so long.

193
00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:40.860
I feel like I don't even
know you anymore.

194
00:16:44.796 --> 00:16:46.431
Here. Take it.

195
00:16:46.464 --> 00:16:47.876
I got some cash
to help pay for things too.

196
00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:49.634
I don't want your dirty money.

197
00:16:49.668 --> 00:16:51.904
You don't think I know
what's going on?

198
00:16:51.938 --> 00:16:55.107
I was on these streets
before you were even born.

199
00:16:55.141 --> 00:16:56.108
Then you know
what you need to do

200
00:16:56.142 --> 00:16:58.577
in order to survive.

201
00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:00.445
This money doesn't know
where it's been.

202
00:17:00.478 --> 00:17:02.781
And we need it. as a family.

203
00:17:02.814 --> 00:17:05.918
You're a very smart
young woman. Lakota.

204
00:17:05.952 --> 00:17:07.619
Know just what to say.

205
00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:11.991
How was school today?

206
00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:14.861
It was great. uh...

207
00:17:14.894 --> 00:17:16.062
learned a ton.

208
00:17:16.095 --> 00:17:19.464
Ms. Smith is teaching us about
the Louis Riel rebellion.

209
00:17:19.497 --> 00:17:24.136
Learning about our heritage
is very important.

210
00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:25.838
When I talked
with Mr. Turner today.

211
00:17:25.872 --> 00:17:28.707
he says you haven't been
to school in weeks!

212
00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:31.010
Oh. well... he doesn't
know that I'm taking

213
00:17:31.043 --> 00:17:32.510
extra-credit classes. and...

214
00:17:32.544 --> 00:17:34.881
Don't lie to me.
Lakota Louise Sampson!

215
00:17:34.914 --> 00:17:37.749
Selling dope
and skipping school?

216
00:17:37.782 --> 00:17:39.618
What the hell is wrong with you?

217
00:17:39.651 --> 00:17:42.787
You want to end up dead
in an alley somewhere?

218
00:17:42.821 --> 00:17:44.623
Think it's easy out there?

219
00:17:44.656 --> 00:17:46.801
If you didn't make minimum wage
at that shit-eating job.

220
00:17:46.825 --> 00:17:49.028
maybe I wouldn't have
to help support this family.

221
00:17:49.061 --> 00:17:51.197
Watch your language!

222
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:54.466
Look. it's. uh...

223
00:17:54.499 --> 00:17:56.102
it's getting really late
and. uh.

224
00:17:56.135 --> 00:17:59.671
I have to wake up really
early in the morning. so...

225
00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:03.075
can you guys just
argue a little quieter?

226
00:18:05.077 --> 00:18:06.979
Get upstairs. little brother.

227
00:18:07.013 --> 00:18:08.147
Now.

228
00:18:12.852 --> 00:18:15.654
I'm very disappointed
in you. Lakota.

229
00:18:15.687 --> 00:18:18.925
I thought I raised you
better than this.

230
00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:22.794
Please. I'm asking you
to work with me.

231
00:18:22.828 --> 00:18:24.663
You're headed down
the black path.

232
00:18:24.696 --> 00:18:26.132
I've seen it before.

233
00:18:26.165 --> 00:18:27.199
Save it.

234
00:18:27.233 --> 00:18:28.968
And keep the dirty money.

235
00:18:29.001 --> 00:18:30.502
You're gonna need it...

236
00:18:30.535 --> 00:18:31.904
Marie.

237
00:19:32.965 --> 00:19:35.134
Hey. cowboy.

238
00:19:35.167 --> 00:19:36.268
Coke?

239
00:19:42.707 --> 00:19:44.542
It's all right. I got ya.

240
00:19:44.576 --> 00:19:46.711
I don't feel so good.

241
00:19:46.745 --> 00:19:48.613
Uh. you can't leave
out this door. guys.

242
00:19:48.646 --> 00:19:49.748
Emergency exit only.

243
00:19:49.781 --> 00:19:50.892
You'll have to use
the front doors.

244
00:19:50.916 --> 00:19:52.160
Just a little bit
too much to drink.

245
00:19:52.184 --> 00:19:53.219
She just needs some air.

246
00:19:53.252 --> 00:19:55.687
- We didn't drink anything!
- Like. right now.

247
00:21:00.986 --> 00:21:03.956
Let me out!

248
00:21:03.989 --> 00:21:06.624
Let me...

249
00:21:29.681 --> 00:21:31.783
You look beautiful. Kôhkom.

250
00:21:34.186 --> 00:21:36.055
You ready to take
your grandmother outside.

251
00:21:36.088 --> 00:21:37.356
young man?

252
00:21:37.389 --> 00:21:39.091
Are you sure you don't want
to come with me

253
00:21:39.125 --> 00:21:40.792
to Saddle Lake?

254
00:21:40.825 --> 00:21:43.661
I need you to understand
how very important

255
00:21:43.695 --> 00:21:45.197
this trip is

256
00:21:45.231 --> 00:21:47.433
to me and to you.

257
00:21:47.466 --> 00:21:49.068
I don't think I need to go.

258
00:21:49.101 --> 00:21:51.203
Need someone to help you
with your visions?

259
00:21:51.237 --> 00:21:54.140
You haven't had nightmares
since you were small.

260
00:21:54.173 --> 00:21:57.376
- I think that...
- It's nothing. really.

261
00:21:57.409 --> 00:21:59.411
It's nothing.

262
00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:03.282
Too much coffee.
you know my nerves. I...

263
00:22:03.315 --> 00:22:05.750
I get anxious sometimes.

264
00:22:05.783 --> 00:22:07.295
The medicine man wants
to talk to you. and...

265
00:22:07.319 --> 00:22:09.955
I have to finish
this weekend's show.

266
00:22:09.989 --> 00:22:11.390
It's worth a thousand bucks.

267
00:22:11.423 --> 00:22:13.791
It'll go a long way
to help with all the bills.

268
00:22:13.825 --> 00:22:15.760
I let you get away with a lot.

269
00:22:15.793 --> 00:22:18.197
but that time
is coming to an end.

270
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:19.398
You need to start acting

271
00:22:19.431 --> 00:22:21.233
- like a ma...
- When the gig is over.

272
00:22:21.267 --> 00:22:23.768
I swear that Lakota and I
will come and visit you.

273
00:22:23.801 --> 00:22:25.471
And see the medicine man?

274
00:22:25.504 --> 00:22:27.006
You promise?

275
00:22:29.074 --> 00:22:32.211
Cross my heart and hope to die.

276
00:22:39.485 --> 00:22:42.288
You have to let go of me
sometime. Derrick.

277
00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:48.994
And tell Lakota I'm sorry.

278
00:22:49.028 --> 00:22:53.065
that I don't like it
when we fight like this.

279
00:22:53.098 --> 00:22:56.135
I love both of you
more than you know.

280
00:22:56.168 --> 00:22:57.403
See you soon.

281
00:23:33.038 --> 00:23:34.506
Wake up!

282
00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:35.807
Look what we have here.

283
00:23:35.841 --> 00:23:38.911
A wanna-be boy hero.

284
00:23:38.944 --> 00:23:41.513
We're taking this guitar. chump.
to start.

285
00:23:41.547 --> 00:23:43.349
But...

286
00:23:45.551 --> 00:23:47.453
We can take whatever we want.

287
00:23:53.425 --> 00:23:55.828
No. no!

288
00:23:55.861 --> 00:23:57.229
Pick him up.

289
00:23:59.531 --> 00:24:01.133
You're in big trouble. prigger.

290
00:24:01.166 --> 00:24:03.369
Standing up for that slut's
gonna cost you.

291
00:24:03.402 --> 00:24:06.105
It's gonna hurt the guitar
more than you.

292
00:24:17.483 --> 00:24:18.816
Dool.

293
00:24:18.851 --> 00:24:20.352
If I see you
or your retard boyfriend

294
00:24:20.386 --> 00:24:22.454
hassling anyone else again.

295
00:24:22.488 --> 00:24:24.123
you're history.

296
00:24:24.156 --> 00:24:25.958
Now. get outta here
before someone finds out

297
00:24:25.991 --> 00:24:28.227
you got beat up by a girl.

298
00:24:33.532 --> 00:24:35.968
You look rough.

299
00:24:36.001 --> 00:24:39.171
I'm... I'm okay.

300
00:24:39.204 --> 00:24:41.340
Can I have my guitar back.
please?

301
00:24:41.373 --> 00:24:43.013
You're gonna have to learn
how to stand up

302
00:24:43.042 --> 00:24:46.312
to these kinds of...

303
00:24:46.345 --> 00:24:47.546
monsters.

304
00:24:49.948 --> 00:24:52.484
Hey! Cardinal!

305
00:24:52.518 --> 00:24:54.987
You're not supposed
to be on school property.

306
00:24:58.123 --> 00:25:00.459
And beatin' on a student.

307
00:25:00.492 --> 00:25:01.493
That's a no-no.

308
00:25:01.527 --> 00:25:03.896
You're going back to jail
where you belong.

309
00:25:03.929 --> 00:25:05.297
Jesus. Georgie.

310
00:25:05.331 --> 00:25:07.933
Think I'd be hanging out
if I beat this kid up?

311
00:25:07.966 --> 00:25:09.311
That's not what happened
at all. Georgie.

312
00:25:09.335 --> 00:25:10.936
- She stopped...
- It's Officer Karras.

313
00:25:10.969 --> 00:25:13.072
and you shut up
until I ask you something.

314
00:25:13.105 --> 00:25:15.307
I came here to look
for a good friend of mine.

315
00:25:15.341 --> 00:25:17.109
Thought she may have been here.

316
00:25:17.142 --> 00:25:19.945
Her mom hasn't seen her.
no one has.

317
00:25:19.978 --> 00:25:22.981
That's her.

318
00:25:23.015 --> 00:25:23.982
So you can't find her.

319
00:25:24.016 --> 00:25:25.627
so you figured you'd
squeeze some information

320
00:25:25.651 --> 00:25:27.286
out of Desjardins?

321
00:25:27.319 --> 00:25:30.122
I-I saved a girl
from those two assholes.

322
00:25:30.155 --> 00:25:34.159
Jibril and Nasim. and... and...

323
00:25:34.193 --> 00:25:37.129
What are you getting at. boy?

324
00:25:37.162 --> 00:25:38.664
Who do you think beat me up?

325
00:25:38.697 --> 00:25:40.966
Jesus. Georgie.

326
00:25:40.999 --> 00:25:42.477
Don't they teach you
any kind of deduction

327
00:25:42.501 --> 00:25:43.969
in cop school?

328
00:25:44.002 --> 00:25:46.372
Officer Karras.
report immediately to...

329
00:25:48.974 --> 00:25:51.610
I gotta go.

330
00:25:51.643 --> 00:25:53.612
I want you off school property.

331
00:25:53.645 --> 00:25:55.280
Right now. Cardinal.

332
00:25:55.314 --> 00:25:56.515
Sure. Georgie.

333
00:25:56.548 --> 00:25:58.384
Whatever you want.

334
00:26:00.686 --> 00:26:04.022
And you. Desjardins.

335
00:26:04.056 --> 00:26:08.193
Go... clean yourself up. boy.

336
00:26:08.227 --> 00:26:11.997
Bleeding all over the place
like a stuck pig.

337
00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:14.967
What about the missing girl.
Officer Karras?

338
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.935
Aren't you gonna help find her?

339
00:26:18.437 --> 00:26:19.605
See what I can do.

340
00:26:23.275 --> 00:26:25.244
All right. put the guitar down.

341
00:26:25.277 --> 00:26:27.146
You're getting blood
all over it.

342
00:26:31.316 --> 00:26:34.586
I don't even know
your first name.

343
00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:36.054
I'm Derrick.

344
00:26:36.088 --> 00:26:37.489
I know who you are.

345
00:26:37.523 --> 00:26:39.458
Lakota's baby brother.

346
00:26:41.026 --> 00:26:42.561
I'm looking for your sister.

347
00:26:42.594 --> 00:26:45.697
She's supposed to meet me
and never showed.

348
00:26:45.731 --> 00:26:49.435
Yeah. her and Kôhkom
got in a big fight last night.

349
00:26:49.468 --> 00:26:51.503
She left pretty upset.

350
00:26:51.537 --> 00:26:53.472
I haven't seen her since.

351
00:26:57.242 --> 00:26:59.678
Why did you lie
to Officer Karras?

352
00:26:59.711 --> 00:27:01.280
You know he could have
helped us.

353
00:27:01.313 --> 00:27:03.048
I don't trust Georgie.

354
00:27:03.081 --> 00:27:04.450
We go way back on the streets.

355
00:27:04.483 --> 00:27:08.954
and he seems like
he wants to help. but...

356
00:27:10.622 --> 00:27:13.225
Eh. It's all about him.

357
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:20.208
Lakota might have went back
to Rock Central Station.

358
00:27:20.232 --> 00:27:22.201
That was next on my list.

359
00:27:22.234 --> 00:27:23.344
Come on.
let's get the hell out of here

360
00:27:23.368 --> 00:27:26.371
before Georgie makes it back.

361
00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.749
Rock Central Station.

362
00:28:11.483 --> 00:28:13.318
Turn that shit down!

363
00:28:19.324 --> 00:28:22.060
When I talk to you.
you better listen.

364
00:28:22.094 --> 00:28:24.630
or I'm not paying your rent.

365
00:28:27.566 --> 00:28:30.135
Now. you're gonna be
on your hands and knees

366
00:28:30.168 --> 00:28:32.471
to clean up
every goddamned speck.

367
00:28:32.504 --> 00:28:33.539
You get that?

368
00:28:36.174 --> 00:28:37.309
Now. what did I say?

369
00:28:37.342 --> 00:28:40.812
On your hands and knees
until this is all cleaned up.

370
00:28:40.847 --> 00:28:42.548
But where am I
supposed to put them?

371
00:28:42.581 --> 00:28:44.683
Charlie. just relax
for a minute.

372
00:28:44.716 --> 00:28:47.286
Ty's gonna clean this up
and turn the radio down.

373
00:28:47.319 --> 00:28:49.154
Aren't you. honey?

374
00:28:49.187 --> 00:28:50.789
This kid's gotta learn respect

375
00:28:50.822 --> 00:28:52.190
just like I did.

376
00:28:58.898 --> 00:29:01.133
Ty. I got your favorite lunch.

377
00:29:01.166 --> 00:29:02.234
KD with wieners.

378
00:29:02.267 --> 00:29:05.404
and I cut 'em up
just the way you like 'em.

379
00:29:11.243 --> 00:29:14.179
Charlie was just trying
to make a man out of you.

380
00:29:14.212 --> 00:29:18.317
He loves you.
but he's. um. complicated.

381
00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:21.854
I can do without
that kind of love.

382
00:29:21.888 --> 00:29:24.323
Eat it up. honey.

383
00:29:30.897 --> 00:29:32.497
Screw both of you!

384
00:29:35.701 --> 00:29:37.870
Hard learner. huh?

385
00:29:37.904 --> 00:29:40.606
Come here.
you worthless piece of shit.

386
00:29:44.576 --> 00:29:46.511
Mom!

387
00:29:46.545 --> 00:29:49.214
Charlie...

388
00:29:50.782 --> 00:29:54.753
Look what you made me do.
you stupid bitch.

389
00:29:54.786 --> 00:29:57.489
They'll put me away forever
this time.

390
00:29:57.522 --> 00:30:02.294
I saw him trip
and fall down the stairs.

391
00:30:02.327 --> 00:30:04.329
What are you talking about.
woman?

392
00:30:04.363 --> 00:30:07.799
He's a clumsy boy.
he's always falling down.

393
00:30:07.834 --> 00:30:09.768
Just like cousin Geordie.

394
00:31:01.653 --> 00:31:03.555
Let me out of here. you asshole!

395
00:32:13.059 --> 00:32:13.926
Yeah.

396
00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.327
Whatever. dickhead.

397
00:32:37.549 --> 00:32:39.785
What in the holy hell
happened to you?

398
00:32:39.818 --> 00:32:42.922
It's... it's been a real
shitty day. Jon.

399
00:32:42.955 --> 00:32:45.958
Listen. I can't play tonight.

400
00:32:45.992 --> 00:32:47.626
What you talkin' 'bout. Willis?

401
00:32:47.659 --> 00:32:51.663
I'm not gonna be here for
the rest of the weekend. either.

402
00:32:51.696 --> 00:32:54.800
Lakota's missing. and I...

403
00:32:54.834 --> 00:32:57.803
That bad. hey?

404
00:32:57.837 --> 00:33:01.908
Well. I. uh. always wanted
to be the lead singer anyway.

405
00:33:08.915 --> 00:33:12.885
I. uh. don't believe
that we've had the pleasure.

406
00:33:12.919 --> 00:33:15.955
I'm. uh...

407
00:33:15.988 --> 00:33:17.556
Later.

408
00:33:22.862 --> 00:33:26.398
Spying on the student body
again. eh. Georgie?

409
00:33:26.431 --> 00:33:29.367
Just stand still for a minute.
baby brother.

410
00:33:29.401 --> 00:33:30.870
Can't go walking around
like an extra

411
00:33:30.903 --> 00:33:34.106
from a zombie flick.

412
00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:37.109
So was Lakota here last night
or what?

413
00:33:37.143 --> 00:33:39.078
Oh. she was here. all right.

414
00:33:39.111 --> 00:33:41.013
Came in near close
and left with some guy.

415
00:33:41.047 --> 00:33:42.414
Pretty hammered. too.

416
00:33:42.447 --> 00:33:43.558
Went right out
the emergency doors

417
00:33:43.582 --> 00:33:45.151
after I told them not to.

418
00:33:45.184 --> 00:33:47.854
My sister does not
do drugs or drink.

419
00:33:52.457 --> 00:33:54.593
'Scuse me. miss?

420
00:33:54.626 --> 00:33:57.762
You don't have security cameras
out back. do you?

421
00:33:57.796 --> 00:34:00.465
It's Dana. and yeah.
we had some put in

422
00:34:00.498 --> 00:34:02.034
after our bouncer
almost got killed.

423
00:34:02.068 --> 00:34:04.837
I'm gonna need to see
the footage from last night.

424
00:34:04.871 --> 00:34:06.138
Like. right now.

425
00:34:09.208 --> 00:34:10.843
Come on.

426
00:34:13.445 --> 00:34:15.114
Can't make out a license plate.

427
00:34:15.147 --> 00:34:18.750
Are you... sure you don't have
anything better-quality?

428
00:34:19.751 --> 00:34:21.153
What you see is what you get.

429
00:34:21.187 --> 00:34:23.421
This isn't exactly a pro setup.

430
00:34:23.455 --> 00:34:24.957
Now. if that's it.

431
00:34:24.991 --> 00:34:27.492
I gotta get back to work
before my boss comes in.

432
00:34:27.525 --> 00:34:29.628
No. but you have
to help us find her!

433
00:34:29.661 --> 00:34:31.563
I need to find my sister.

434
00:34:31.596 --> 00:34:34.566
You... you have to help. please.

435
00:34:34.599 --> 00:34:36.635
This isn't her fault.

436
00:34:36.668 --> 00:34:38.070
She's helping the best she can.

437
00:34:38.104 --> 00:34:41.040
Let Dana get back to work
and we'll talk outside.

438
00:34:49.215 --> 00:34:50.983
This footage will get us
a meeting downtown

439
00:34:51.017 --> 00:34:52.885
with the inspector.

440
00:34:52.919 --> 00:34:53.785
And maybe. just maybe.

441
00:34:53.818 --> 00:34:56.621
I might be able
to get some traction.

442
00:34:56.655 --> 00:34:58.790
Now the fact that she was wasted

443
00:34:58.823 --> 00:35:00.659
tells me that either
she changed overnight

444
00:35:00.692 --> 00:35:03.829
from the friend I've known
the last five years. or...

445
00:35:03.863 --> 00:35:06.198
- But Lakota's...
- It's probably Special K

446
00:35:06.232 --> 00:35:08.533
or GHB.

447
00:35:08.566 --> 00:35:10.937
Date-rape drugs.

448
00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:14.106
I saw it a lot
when I was on the streets.

449
00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:15.540
A girl that I had helped.

450
00:35:15.573 --> 00:35:17.776
she was drugged
and managed to escape.

451
00:35:17.809 --> 00:35:18.743
Lemme guess:

452
00:35:18.777 --> 00:35:20.779
From a guy in a cowboy hat
in a black car?

453
00:35:20.812 --> 00:35:23.983
You're a real smart kid.
Cardinal.

454
00:35:24.016 --> 00:35:28.687
Now. shut up and
let me do the investigating.

455
00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:32.058
When I talked to her.
she was scared to death.

456
00:35:32.091 --> 00:35:33.725
But I learned something.

457
00:35:33.758 --> 00:35:34.836
He kept staring at the moon

458
00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:37.196
and mumbling something about
how he wasn't gonna

459
00:35:37.229 --> 00:35:39.131
let her hurt him again.

460
00:35:39.165 --> 00:35:41.901
I think he hunts on a full moon.

461
00:35:41.934 --> 00:35:44.769
It fits some of
the other disappearances.

462
00:35:44.803 --> 00:35:46.906
No. No. she has to be okay.
okay?

463
00:35:46.939 --> 00:35:48.673
She has to.

464
00:35:48.707 --> 00:35:49.674
Her and Kôhkom are all I got.

465
00:35:49.708 --> 00:35:52.912
- and if I lose something...
- We will find her.

466
00:35:52.945 --> 00:35:55.081
and Georgie's going to help us.

467
00:35:55.114 --> 00:35:56.514
There's no distinct proof.

468
00:35:56.548 --> 00:35:58.583
This guy is really good.

469
00:35:58.616 --> 00:36:02.121
But... I found
a stretch of highway

470
00:36:02.154 --> 00:36:03.222
called the Road of Tears.

471
00:36:03.255 --> 00:36:05.095
It's near where some
of the other missing women

472
00:36:05.124 --> 00:36:08.828
were seen hitchhiking.

473
00:36:08.861 --> 00:36:10.830
It's the only real lead I have.

474
00:36:13.933 --> 00:36:16.268
Oh. And you two.

475
00:36:16.302 --> 00:36:17.736
you're staying here in town.

476
00:36:17.769 --> 00:36:21.107
This guy's a frickin' lunatic.

477
00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:22.875
I'm gonna save Lakota.

478
00:36:22.908 --> 00:36:24.609
And then I'm gonna go and...

479
00:36:24.642 --> 00:36:27.880
You're gonna plant your ass
here like I told you to. boy.

480
00:36:29.215 --> 00:36:30.715
I need both of you here.

481
00:36:30.749 --> 00:36:32.284
for questioning
and to keep you safe.

482
00:36:32.318 --> 00:36:34.120
This is police business.

483
00:36:36.588 --> 00:36:39.291
Gonna get this footage
over to our tech.

484
00:36:39.325 --> 00:36:41.227
see what else
we can come up with.

485
00:36:46.598 --> 00:36:47.967
Desjardins!

486
00:36:50.036 --> 00:36:52.737
I don't wanna catch you
in here again.

487
00:36:52.771 --> 00:36:54.273
You're still a minor.

488
00:37:01.914 --> 00:37:03.883
But we need his help
to find Lakota.

489
00:37:03.916 --> 00:37:04.850
Screw him.

490
00:37:04.884 --> 00:37:05.961
I've been burned a few times.

491
00:37:05.985 --> 00:37:08.087
that's good enough for me.

492
00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:11.223
We're on our own.

493
00:37:12.958 --> 00:37:15.061
I'm here for you. baby brother.

494
00:37:15.094 --> 00:37:18.297
We'll find Lakota together.
I promise.

495
00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:19.231
Now. come on.

496
00:37:19.265 --> 00:37:21.133
We need to find a way
to the grasslands.

497
00:37:49.295 --> 00:37:50.830
Thank you.

498
00:37:59.138 --> 00:38:01.407
Aw. this is awesome.

499
00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:05.845
Bet there's no cell phone tower
for miles.

500
00:38:05.878 --> 00:38:07.645
I don't know. you know?

501
00:38:07.679 --> 00:38:08.813
It's kinda nice.

502
00:38:08.848 --> 00:38:10.724
I haven't been out of the city
since Kôhkom took

503
00:38:10.748 --> 00:38:12.251
me and Lakota when we were kids.

504
00:38:14.887 --> 00:38:16.088
What. is something wrong?

505
00:38:16.122 --> 00:38:16.956
Am I okay?

506
00:38:16.989 --> 00:38:18.790
Just looking for
the lobotomy scars.

507
00:38:18.823 --> 00:38:21.393
This place is a dump!

508
00:38:21.427 --> 00:38:23.229
Come on. let's get a room.

509
00:38:23.262 --> 00:38:25.898
I don't wanna be here
any longer than I have to.

510
00:38:28.834 --> 00:38:30.836
Hi. is Kôhkom there?

511
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:35.773
I'm sorry...
is Marie Desjardins there?

512
00:38:38.911 --> 00:38:41.746
Can you let her know that
her grandson Derrick called

513
00:38:41.779 --> 00:38:44.884
and I'll try again later?

514
00:38:44.917 --> 00:38:48.220
Thanks.

515
00:38:51.924 --> 00:38:54.692
I miss you. Kôhkom.

516
00:38:55.727 --> 00:38:58.063
I don't know if I can do this
without you.

517
00:38:59.331 --> 00:39:02.935
Sure you can. baby brother.

518
00:39:02.968 --> 00:39:04.937
What the hell was that
back in the lobby?

519
00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:06.939
Not signing your name
for the room?

520
00:39:06.972 --> 00:39:08.908
I didn't wanna
write my name down.

521
00:39:08.941 --> 00:39:11.243
What happens if the cops
come looking for us?

522
00:39:11.277 --> 00:39:15.281
Jesus! You don't use
your real goddamned name.

523
00:39:18.217 --> 00:39:19.751
Well. what is your name?

524
00:39:19.784 --> 00:39:23.355
I know your last name
is Cardinal. but...

525
00:39:23.389 --> 00:39:27.193
In this case. I'm using the name
that's on the credit card.

526
00:39:27.226 --> 00:39:30.129
Wait. where'd you get
the credit card from?

527
00:39:30.162 --> 00:39:32.264
Is it stolen?

528
00:39:32.298 --> 00:39:35.267
I wish I woulda got a better
look at Georgie's map. but

529
00:39:35.301 --> 00:39:37.469
I'm pretty sure
it's right around here.

530
00:39:37.503 --> 00:39:40.139
Let's get packed up
and get the hell outta here.

531
00:39:40.172 --> 00:39:43.509
You're in charge
of the chow and water.

532
00:39:43.542 --> 00:39:45.177
Okay. but we're gonna
smudge first.

533
00:39:45.211 --> 00:39:49.114
And what possible reason
would I wanna do that?

534
00:39:49.148 --> 00:39:52.084
'Cause I can see things
that most people can't.

535
00:39:52.117 --> 00:39:54.887
and I need to be smudging
to see it.

536
00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:59.892
Look. I really don't wanna
do this. but...

537
00:39:59.925 --> 00:40:01.994
if I don't...

538
00:40:02.027 --> 00:40:04.296
I haven't smudged since...

539
00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:10.202
It was a long time ago
with my dad.

540
00:40:10.236 --> 00:40:13.839
And just what makes you think
I can help you?

541
00:40:13.872 --> 00:40:15.841
Just a feeling.

542
00:40:15.874 --> 00:40:17.843
Trust me. please.

543
00:40:17.876 --> 00:40:20.546
We need to find my sister
right now.

544
00:40:20.579 --> 00:40:23.048
and this is our best shot.

545
00:40:35.461 --> 00:40:36.428
What?

546
00:40:36.462 --> 00:40:38.063
What do you want from me?

547
00:40:40.165 --> 00:40:42.167
I'm not gonna eat
your dog's food!

548
00:40:42.201 --> 00:40:44.570
Might as well kill me now.

549
00:40:47.373 --> 00:40:48.340
What?

550
00:40:48.374 --> 00:40:50.009
What do you want me to do?

551
00:41:19.471 --> 00:41:22.841
Gonna make me eat like a dog
again for you?

552
00:41:22.875 --> 00:41:28.147
Got the balls to come in here
without a knife this time?

553
00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:30.015
You like me naked
on my knees for you.

554
00:41:30.049 --> 00:41:32.318
don't you. you asshole?

555
00:41:32.351 --> 00:41:34.053
Look down.

556
00:41:46.365 --> 00:41:48.033
What is wrong with you?

557
00:41:48.067 --> 00:41:51.370
You kidnap me. torture me.
drug me.

558
00:41:51.403 --> 00:41:54.273
then you wanna play nice?

559
00:41:55.407 --> 00:41:56.942
Kill me. then.

560
00:41:56.975 --> 00:41:58.577
I don't care anymore.

561
00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:00.212
I've had it.

562
00:42:00.245 --> 00:42:02.915
Come in here and stand up to me.

563
00:42:02.948 --> 00:42:04.350
if you're man enough.

564
00:42:04.383 --> 00:42:06.085
Enough!

565
00:42:15.961 --> 00:42:18.597
As soon as I saw you.

566
00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:20.299
I knew I had to have you.

567
00:42:23.035 --> 00:42:27.106
You remind me a lot of...

568
00:42:27.139 --> 00:42:28.374
someone.

569
00:42:30.542 --> 00:42:33.445
But you need to learn respect

570
00:42:33.479 --> 00:42:35.147
and who's in charge.

571
00:42:37.716 --> 00:42:41.420
You can't just kidnap people
and torture them. buddy.

572
00:42:41.453 --> 00:42:45.324
You're going to jail
for the rest of your life.

573
00:42:48.594 --> 00:42:50.529
I really do like you.

574
00:42:54.566 --> 00:42:56.402
But...

575
00:42:56.435 --> 00:42:58.036
Then let me go. please!

576
00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:01.974
I won't say anything. I promise.

577
00:43:09.014 --> 00:43:10.449
You're awake.

578
00:43:10.482 --> 00:43:11.683
Well. that's great.

579
00:43:11.717 --> 00:43:13.519
We were getting
a little worried.

580
00:43:13.552 --> 00:43:16.722
That was quite a spill you took.

581
00:43:16.755 --> 00:43:18.624
Mom?

582
00:43:18.657 --> 00:43:20.392
I'm Dr. Connors.

583
00:43:20.426 --> 00:43:23.128
the neurologist assigned
to your case.

584
00:43:23.162 --> 00:43:25.664
And you can call me Julie.

585
00:43:25.697 --> 00:43:27.733
I need you to pay attention

586
00:43:27.766 --> 00:43:30.536
to what
I'm going to tell you. okay?

587
00:43:30.569 --> 00:43:32.237
This is very important.

588
00:43:32.271 --> 00:43:35.174
You suffered a major
traumatic brain injury.

589
00:43:35.207 --> 00:43:37.176
and we were able
to stem the bleeding

590
00:43:37.209 --> 00:43:39.044
and shield your brain
with a metal plate.

591
00:43:39.077 --> 00:43:41.313
Does that mean I'll be okay?

592
00:43:41.346 --> 00:43:44.049
You're young enough
to be able to shake this off.

593
00:43:44.082 --> 00:43:45.527
And we should be able
to get that plate out

594
00:43:45.551 --> 00:43:48.320
once you're all healed up.
but...

595
00:43:48.353 --> 00:43:50.722
you need to take these meds
every day

596
00:43:50.756 --> 00:43:52.624
for the rest of your life.
Tyson.

597
00:43:52.658 --> 00:43:55.761
I want to see you take one.

598
00:43:55.794 --> 00:43:58.997
and I want you to promise me

599
00:43:59.031 --> 00:44:02.067
you will always
have this with you

600
00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:03.368
and take it daily.

601
00:44:03.402 --> 00:44:05.337
You can come to me
for the refills

602
00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:07.272
at no charge.

603
00:44:10.375 --> 00:44:12.444
I promise.

604
00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:17.316
That's a good boy.

605
00:44:19.184 --> 00:44:21.620
Now. let me examine you
a little closer

606
00:44:21.653 --> 00:44:23.989
now that you're awake.

607
00:44:29.127 --> 00:44:32.564
You have the most
beautiful eyes. Julie.

608
00:44:32.598 --> 00:44:35.400
Well. thank you. Tyson.

609
00:44:35.434 --> 00:44:41.139
They say the eyes
are the windows of the soul.

610
00:44:41.173 --> 00:44:42.474
If that's true.

611
00:44:42.508 --> 00:44:45.310
I don't even know
if my mom has a soul.

612
00:44:45.344 --> 00:44:48.113
She can't even look at me
in the eyes.

613
00:44:48.146 --> 00:44:50.782
Yes. I've met your mother.

614
00:44:50.816 --> 00:44:53.585
And I want you to know that

615
00:44:53.619 --> 00:44:56.121
there are people here
that care for you.

616
00:44:56.154 --> 00:44:59.191
We're not all like her.

617
00:45:26.853 --> 00:45:28.654
What do you think you are.

618
00:45:28.687 --> 00:45:31.390
some kind of magic man?

619
00:45:31.423 --> 00:45:34.293
A shaman?

620
00:45:34.326 --> 00:45:35.827
I got this lady in my building

621
00:45:35.862 --> 00:45:37.864
who can tell your future
with tea leaves.

622
00:45:37.897 --> 00:45:40.232
Quiet. please.

623
00:45:40.265 --> 00:45:42.869
It's really important
to clear the space

624
00:45:42.902 --> 00:45:44.837
as we set our intention.

625
00:45:53.612 --> 00:45:55.347
Now what?

626
00:45:58.750 --> 00:46:02.554
I need you to hold my hand
as we set our intention

627
00:46:02.588 --> 00:46:03.388
for finding Lakota.

628
00:46:03.422 --> 00:46:05.257
This better not be
some kinda scam

629
00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:07.125
to try and get me in bed.

630
00:46:07.159 --> 00:46:09.294
or you're in big trouble. buddy.

631
00:46:20.639 --> 00:46:22.374
Close your eyes...

632
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:29.481
and focus on seeing Lakota
in your mind's eye.

633
00:46:34.286 --> 00:46:36.889
Let the smoke wash over you.

634
00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:47.666
Please help me. Great Creator.

635
00:46:47.699 --> 00:46:49.468
I'm really scared and

636
00:46:49.501 --> 00:46:51.570
I could use
any help I could get.

637
00:47:01.613 --> 00:47:03.482
Neechie?

638
00:47:03.515 --> 00:47:05.717
Lakota. I will find you.
I promise.

639
00:47:11.423 --> 00:47:13.759
I won't let you have her.

640
00:47:13.792 --> 00:47:15.727
And I swear I will find you.

641
00:47:22.434 --> 00:47:23.802
Leave her. brother.

642
00:47:23.836 --> 00:47:25.570
There is nothing you can do now.

643
00:47:29.675 --> 00:47:32.644
Let me out!

644
00:47:32.678 --> 00:47:37.950
Help me!

645
00:47:37.984 --> 00:47:39.751
Wake up!

646
00:47:39.785 --> 00:47:43.588
We have to leave. now!

647
00:47:43.622 --> 00:47:44.622
Derrick.

648
00:47:46.291 --> 00:47:50.830
I'm doing this for 'Kota
and nothing to do with you.

649
00:48:01.473 --> 00:48:03.442
This better have been worth it.

650
00:48:03.475 --> 00:48:06.846
I saw the car
that she was taken in.

651
00:48:06.879 --> 00:48:08.380
And there's a sign that...

652
00:48:08.413 --> 00:48:10.950
This is the manager.
open this door right now!

653
00:48:34.673 --> 00:48:38.878
That was quite the way to get me
out of the vision. Ms. Cardinal.

654
00:48:38.911 --> 00:48:42.781
I guess.

655
00:48:42.814 --> 00:48:47.019
Guess you can call me Lisa.

656
00:48:47.053 --> 00:48:51.490
Just don't be expecting anything
like that again. baby brother.

657
00:48:54.493 --> 00:48:56.896
Quit picking at it already.

658
00:48:56.929 --> 00:49:02.334
I swear I'm spending
half of my time cleaning you up.

659
00:49:02.367 --> 00:49:03.870
Where did all that smoke
come from?

660
00:49:03.903 --> 00:49:07.974
It's a sage bundle
not some freaking bonfire.

661
00:49:08.007 --> 00:49:14.080
It's the first time
I've ever been hurt in a vision.

662
00:49:14.113 --> 00:49:17.917
I was chasing after them
and then...

663
00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:19.551
Run!

664
00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:58.057
Sorry I'm late. come on in.

665
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.036
How are you feeling. Tyson?

666
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:11.469
Everything good?

667
00:50:11.503 --> 00:50:13.105
You know how it is.

668
00:50:13.139 --> 00:50:14.974
Some good days.

669
00:50:15.007 --> 00:50:17.609
Some not so good days.

670
00:50:17.642 --> 00:50:19.444
Work's been murder.

671
00:50:19.477 --> 00:50:24.449
Are you taking your meds
like we agreed on?

672
00:50:24.482 --> 00:50:26.986
I don't like the way
they make me feel.

673
00:50:27.019 --> 00:50:32.591
I... I see...

674
00:50:32.624 --> 00:50:35.094
see strange things sometimes.

675
00:50:35.127 --> 00:50:39.731
I...

676
00:50:39.764 --> 00:50:41.167
I don't...

677
00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:44.603
I don't think I want to take
them anymore. Dr. Connors.

678
00:51:09.061 --> 00:51:10.830
Tyson.

679
00:51:10.863 --> 00:51:12.430
Tyson?

680
00:51:12.464 --> 00:51:13.598
Are you okay?

681
00:51:13.632 --> 00:51:15.433
It's Julie

682
00:51:15.467 --> 00:51:17.569
and yes you do. mister.

683
00:51:17.602 --> 00:51:19.537
The side effects
are from your brain injury

684
00:51:19.571 --> 00:51:21.007
not the drugs.

685
00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:22.909
Things would be
a lot worse without them.

686
00:51:22.942 --> 00:51:26.913
Trust me. the reason why you
need to keep taking your meds

687
00:51:26.946 --> 00:51:31.918
like we agreed on is this metal
plate in your skull.

688
00:51:31.951 --> 00:51:33.685
Can I get it out?

689
00:51:33.718 --> 00:51:35.922
My skull must've healed by now.

690
00:51:35.955 --> 00:51:39.658
I wish we could
but you know why.

691
00:51:39.691 --> 00:51:42.527
Your bone has grown
around the plate

692
00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:45.898
and it's part of you now.

693
00:51:45.932 --> 00:51:50.870
You mean.
I'm stuck with this thing

694
00:51:50.903 --> 00:51:52.838
inside me forever?

695
00:51:52.872 --> 00:51:56.641
You promised I could get it out
when I was better.

696
00:51:56.675 --> 00:51:58.044
I'm so sorry. Tyson.

697
00:51:58.077 --> 00:52:00.947
There's nothing more
I can do at this point.

698
00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:04.816
I said I would try.
I never promised.

699
00:52:04.850 --> 00:52:07.819
You have made
remarkable progress

700
00:52:07.853 --> 00:52:10.755
for someone who has had
a traumatic injury.

701
00:52:10.789 --> 00:52:13.591
I'm proud of what we have
accomplished together

702
00:52:13.625 --> 00:52:19.065
since the accident.

703
00:52:19.098 --> 00:52:20.665
I come here for help

704
00:52:20.699 --> 00:52:23.102
and now I find out
that the drugs you give me

705
00:52:23.135 --> 00:52:26.005
- don't even work.
- That's not true.

706
00:52:26.038 --> 00:52:28.573
The clinical trials of ketamine
were very promising

707
00:52:28.606 --> 00:52:30.775
on lowering inflammation
of the nervous system.

708
00:52:30.809 --> 00:52:32.244
The last thing you need to do

709
00:52:32.278 --> 00:52:37.083
is develop Parkinson's
or Alzheimer's at your age.

710
00:52:39.684 --> 00:52:41.196
There's something else
you need to know

711
00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:46.859
and I know you're not
going to like hearing this.

712
00:52:46.892 --> 00:52:51.730
The titanium plate has caused
stress shielding on your skull

713
00:52:51.763 --> 00:52:56.002
making the bone underneath
to become very brittle.

714
00:52:59.839 --> 00:53:02.274
I think I should have stayed
home this morning.

715
00:53:02.308 --> 00:53:05.878
Tyson. you're gonna be okay.

716
00:53:05.911 --> 00:53:08.247
But you need to know what
is happening to your body

717
00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:12.051
and not take any
unnecessary risks.

718
00:53:15.653 --> 00:53:18.057
Don't forget the medicine.

719
00:53:18.090 --> 00:53:21.994
It's very important.

720
00:53:22.028 --> 00:53:26.098
I don't think you can help me
anymore. Dr. Connors.

721
00:53:26.132 --> 00:53:28.733
It's Julie.

722
00:53:28.767 --> 00:53:32.238
And please. please be careful.

723
00:53:49.889 --> 00:53:51.790
I can feel you're there.
bastard.

724
00:53:57.762 --> 00:53:59.899
I came to see you.

725
00:53:59.932 --> 00:54:04.636
One last time before tonight.

726
00:54:04.669 --> 00:54:07.206
Does that mean
you're letting me go?

727
00:54:13.711 --> 00:54:15.915
Why are you doing this?

728
00:54:15.948 --> 00:54:17.883
I just don't get it.

729
00:54:17.917 --> 00:54:20.819
Please. help me to understand.

730
00:54:20.853 --> 00:54:22.720
I don't even know your name.
I'm...

731
00:54:22.754 --> 00:54:27.193
It doesn't matter who you are.

732
00:54:27.226 --> 00:54:29.995
When the moon is full...

733
00:54:30.029 --> 00:54:31.964
the pain...

734
00:54:31.997 --> 00:54:35.267
will go away.

735
00:54:35.301 --> 00:54:37.069
Is tonight a full moon?

736
00:54:37.103 --> 00:54:42.241
That's when I stop you
from hurting me.

737
00:54:42.274 --> 00:54:46.178
I need to get back
to my brother and grandmother.

738
00:54:46.212 --> 00:54:49.215
Please. please let me go.

739
00:54:49.248 --> 00:54:53.986
You don't have to do this.

740
00:54:54.019 --> 00:54:58.124
I'll do anything you want.
just let me leave!

741
00:54:58.157 --> 00:55:01.693
My family needs me.

742
00:55:01.726 --> 00:55:03.395
Doesn't your family need you?

743
00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:10.668
Ty I feel terrible
for what happened

744
00:55:10.702 --> 00:55:12.438
and I want to
make things better.

745
00:55:12.471 --> 00:55:17.775
I just want to go lie down
in my room.

746
00:55:17.809 --> 00:55:22.680
- Where's Charlie?
- He's out for a while.

747
00:55:22.714 --> 00:55:24.283
Come on. honey.

748
00:55:24.316 --> 00:55:30.156
There's something
I want to show you.

749
00:56:08.527 --> 00:56:11.030
Tigger.

750
00:56:14.833 --> 00:56:18.270
My old friend.

751
00:56:18.304 --> 00:56:21.106
Do you know how close
you came to the end?

752
00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:30.349
The closest thing to family
I have left.

753
00:57:19.031 --> 00:57:22.301
Lakota I'm failing
but I'm not stopping

754
00:57:22.334 --> 00:57:25.037
until I find you.

755
00:57:57.603 --> 00:57:59.038
Go back to the reservation!

756
00:57:59.071 --> 00:58:02.941
Why don't you screw your cousin.
redneck!

757
00:58:06.045 --> 00:58:11.050
Yeah you better run. savage!

758
00:58:15.187 --> 00:58:18.957
♪ I've been running
for so long ♪

759
00:58:18.991 --> 00:58:22.194
♪ Please tell me where I am? ♪

760
00:58:28.033 --> 00:58:31.470
♪ All I remember ♪

761
00:58:31.503 --> 00:58:34.073
♪ Is once I was... ♪

762
00:58:40.412 --> 00:58:43.582
Enjoying the early evening air?

763
00:58:43.615 --> 00:58:46.385
Um. not really.

764
00:58:46.418 --> 00:58:51.056
I'm lost. really tired
and really thirsty.

765
00:58:51.090 --> 00:58:53.492
You don't happen to have
any water. do you?

766
00:58:53.525 --> 00:58:55.094
I sure do. son.

767
00:58:55.127 --> 00:58:56.095
Why don't you get
in the back seat

768
00:58:56.128 --> 00:58:59.965
and we'll see what we can do.

769
00:59:07.706 --> 00:59:12.378
I'll put it in the trunk
for safe keeping.

770
00:59:18.250 --> 00:59:23.489
So. Chief. what brings you
off the reserve today?

771
00:59:23.522 --> 00:59:27.693
Reserve?
I'm out for a walk from town.

772
00:59:27.726 --> 00:59:29.661
I'm looking for
a friend of mine.

773
00:59:29.695 --> 00:59:33.065
Maybe you know him?
Detective George Karras.

774
00:59:33.098 --> 00:59:34.400
Never heard of him.

775
00:59:34.433 --> 00:59:36.201
Why don't you start
with giving us some ID

776
00:59:36.235 --> 00:59:38.470
and telling us just
what you're doing out here.

777
00:59:38.504 --> 00:59:41.073
No one ever comes out here
except for Walter Crabtree

778
00:59:41.106 --> 00:59:43.184
- who lives a few miles back.
- And the convicts from

779
00:59:43.208 --> 00:59:46.578
the reserve who like to
terrorize the community.

780
00:59:46.612 --> 00:59:51.550
You know. I must've left
my ID with my friend.

781
00:59:51.583 --> 00:59:53.585
Detective Karras.

782
00:59:53.619 --> 00:59:55.053
Are you sure you don't know him?

783
00:59:55.087 --> 00:59:57.289
- He's at my...
- Cut the shit. son.

784
00:59:57.322 --> 00:59:59.134
We arrested your girlfriend
earlier this morning

785
00:59:59.158 --> 01:00:01.727
at the motel. you know.
using a stolen credit card

786
01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:04.997
is a federal offense
and arson is too.

787
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:06.698
What's your name?

788
01:00:06.732 --> 01:00:08.567
I'm Derrick Desjardins.

789
01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.068
I don't even have a credit card.

790
01:00:10.102 --> 01:00:12.571
I'm only 17.

791
01:00:12.604 --> 01:00:14.039
I'll see what I can do.

792
01:00:14.072 --> 01:00:16.675
There just might be
a way out of this.

793
01:00:26.452 --> 01:00:29.188
This is quite the list
of charges against you.

794
01:00:29.221 --> 01:00:31.390
If we bring you in
and throw the book at you.

795
01:00:31.423 --> 01:00:34.059
Which we will. you won't be
seeing your family

796
01:00:34.092 --> 01:00:38.163
- for a very long. long while.
- No please.

797
01:00:38.197 --> 01:00:40.199
I have to get out of here
right now.

798
01:00:40.232 --> 01:00:43.535
My sister's in real trouble
and she does not have much time.

799
01:00:43.569 --> 01:00:47.339
Do either of you know a guy with
a cowboy hat in a black car?

800
01:00:49.374 --> 01:00:50.685
You just narrowed it down
to about half the guys

801
01:00:50.709 --> 01:00:53.579
that live around here.
what's this all about?

802
01:00:53.612 --> 01:00:55.747
He's holding my sister
in a cellar prison

803
01:00:55.781 --> 01:00:58.116
off Snake Pass Crescent.

804
01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:59.685
You have to help me find her.

805
01:00:59.718 --> 01:01:01.253
Please.

806
01:01:05.123 --> 01:01:07.226
We don't have to do shit.

807
01:01:07.259 --> 01:01:09.595
- Wait but I...
- You lied to us. right?

808
01:01:09.628 --> 01:01:11.372
Yeah. you've been lying to us
the entire time

809
01:01:11.396 --> 01:01:15.634
you've been in the car.
what makes this different?

810
01:01:15.667 --> 01:01:17.779
If I had a way out of this
for you that doesn't include

811
01:01:17.803 --> 01:01:20.105
getting arrested
or going to jail

812
01:01:20.138 --> 01:01:22.508
- would you be interested?
- Yeah. thank you. sir.

813
01:01:22.541 --> 01:01:24.576
Where do I sign up?

814
01:01:50.168 --> 01:01:51.537
This is it.

815
01:01:51.570 --> 01:01:53.672
Here is your chance
to escape all the charges

816
01:01:53.705 --> 01:01:56.475
and go find your sister.

817
01:01:56.508 --> 01:02:01.113
Thanks. officer. you know.
I do appreciate it but...

818
01:02:01.146 --> 01:02:03.682
I don't know
where I am right now.

819
01:02:03.715 --> 01:02:05.617
At the end of the line.

820
01:02:05.651 --> 01:02:09.221
Or do you want to spend the next
few years in the penitentiary?

821
01:02:09.254 --> 01:02:12.658
I'm sure the convicts would love
a cute thing like you.

822
01:02:12.691 --> 01:02:16.662
Yeah. yeah. no.
right here works for me fine.

823
01:02:16.695 --> 01:02:18.330
Can I get out now please?

824
01:02:36.448 --> 01:02:40.085
Can I have my guitar back
please. sir?

825
01:02:52.899 --> 01:02:55.300
Why would you do that?

826
01:03:00.706 --> 01:03:02.741
Well. now you've got something
to keep you warm.

827
01:03:02.774 --> 01:03:05.344
It gets mighty cold here
at night.

828
01:03:05.377 --> 01:03:08.747
Now you've got some firewood.

829
01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:12.351
Tonto.

830
01:03:12.384 --> 01:03:13.418
Tonto.

831
01:03:19.524 --> 01:03:20.524
Tonto!

832
01:03:58.563 --> 01:04:01.667
Excuse me?

833
01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:02.911
Is there anything
I can help you with?

834
01:04:02.935 --> 01:04:04.636
Yeah. I just came from up north.

835
01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:07.472
I'm tracking two perps that
may have come through town.

836
01:04:12.778 --> 01:04:14.312
From the big city. eh?

837
01:04:14.346 --> 01:04:16.381
We don't get much
of anyone from up there.

838
01:04:16.415 --> 01:04:18.316
What can I help you with.
Detective?

839
01:04:18.350 --> 01:04:19.919
The two individuals in question

840
01:04:19.952 --> 01:04:21.520
were stating at the Vista Motel.

841
01:04:21.553 --> 01:04:23.956
It's a teenage boy
and a young woman in her 20s.

842
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:25.557
Both of aboriginal decent.

843
01:04:25.590 --> 01:04:27.426
Hi here. I'm Staff Sergeant
Lintinsky

844
01:04:27.459 --> 01:04:29.494
and run this station.
you mentioned you're looking

845
01:04:29.528 --> 01:04:31.563
for someone.
did you need to file

846
01:04:31.596 --> 01:04:32.865
a missing's persons report

847
01:04:32.899 --> 01:04:34.299
or put out an APB?

848
01:04:34.332 --> 01:04:37.602
No. no. Detective George Karras.

849
01:04:37.636 --> 01:04:39.839
The clerk at the motel told me
that one of my suspects

850
01:04:39.872 --> 01:04:42.574
may have been picked up by
police earlier this morning.

851
01:04:42.607 --> 01:04:44.476
We didn't pick up anyone
early this morning.

852
01:04:44.509 --> 01:04:46.846
Constable.
can you give me a minute

853
01:04:46.879 --> 01:04:48.848
with the detective please?

854
01:04:52.684 --> 01:04:54.462
Koontz is a good soldier
but doesn't do so well

855
01:04:54.486 --> 01:04:55.922
with out of towners.

856
01:04:55.955 --> 01:04:57.465
I don't even think
he's ever been farther

857
01:04:57.489 --> 01:04:59.725
than 100 miles from home
in his whole life.

858
01:04:59.758 --> 01:05:00.993
Yeah. I know the type.

859
01:05:01.027 --> 01:05:06.331
My guess is he hasn't even been
in uniform for a year. right?

860
01:05:06.364 --> 01:05:09.301
- I'll buzz you in.
- Thanks.

861
01:05:14.706 --> 01:05:18.443
Rookies always got something
to prove. huh?

862
01:05:18.477 --> 01:05:20.479
You're far more right
than you know. detective.

863
01:05:20.512 --> 01:05:22.814
Now getting back
to the matter at hand.

864
01:05:22.849 --> 01:05:25.584
Do you have names and physical
descriptions of the perps?

865
01:05:25.617 --> 01:05:27.019
Yes.

866
01:05:27.053 --> 01:05:29.588
Here's the spelling
of the names.

867
01:05:33.692 --> 01:05:34.894
Let's see.

868
01:05:34.927 --> 01:05:38.630
Lisa Cardinal.

869
01:05:38.663 --> 01:05:41.633
Looks like your first perp
has a wrap sheet a mile long.

870
01:05:41.666 --> 01:05:43.045
Ms. Cardinal has been
involved with crime

871
01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:44.636
since she was 13.

872
01:05:44.669 --> 01:05:46.309
I can't wait to see
what we find out about

873
01:05:46.338 --> 01:05:48.908
this Derrick Desjardins
character.

874
01:05:52.979 --> 01:05:54.412
This is odd.

875
01:05:54.446 --> 01:05:56.515
All I can find is his address.

876
01:05:56.548 --> 01:05:59.051
school. date of birth.
next of kin.

877
01:05:59.085 --> 01:06:00.519
buying habits.
cell phone records

878
01:06:00.552 --> 01:06:02.788
but nothing criminal.

879
01:06:02.821 --> 01:06:04.790
That's very odd indeed.

880
01:06:04.823 --> 01:06:07.325
I have reason to believe
that she's holding him

881
01:06:07.359 --> 01:06:08.660
against his will.

882
01:06:08.693 --> 01:06:10.695
She's a very troubled
young woman.

883
01:06:10.729 --> 01:06:15.001
She brings everybody down
around her.

884
01:06:15.034 --> 01:06:18.737
Look. Derrick's a good kid.

885
01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:20.372
You know?

886
01:06:20.405 --> 01:06:23.075
He just got wrapped up
with a dangerous woman.

887
01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:24.844
We were young once. right?

888
01:06:24.877 --> 01:06:26.846
- Stupid.
- Yeah.

889
01:06:26.879 --> 01:06:29.681
I remember.

890
01:06:29.714 --> 01:06:33.052
The things I did
for a piece of tail.

891
01:06:37.522 --> 01:06:38.766
So I'm going to escort
the Cardinal

892
01:06:38.790 --> 01:06:42.094
back to the Reman Center where
she'll be held before court.

893
01:06:42.128 --> 01:06:44.831
She's going to have to answer
to a list of charges

894
01:06:44.864 --> 01:06:47.432
a mile long.

895
01:06:47.465 --> 01:06:49.101
We picked her up this morning.

896
01:06:49.135 --> 01:06:50.602
She's in the back
held on charges

897
01:06:50.635 --> 01:06:53.738
of credit card fraud and arson.

898
01:06:53.772 --> 01:06:55.507
I don't know what the hell
to do with her.

899
01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:56.617
We're a two person
police station

900
01:06:56.641 --> 01:07:00.980
with one holding cell.

901
01:07:01.013 --> 01:07:03.748
Koontz. take Ms. Cardinal
out of her cell

902
01:07:03.782 --> 01:07:06.551
and accompany her to
the front of the station.

903
01:07:14.526 --> 01:07:18.130
Today's your lucky day.
Cardinal.

904
01:07:18.164 --> 01:07:22.068
There's a detective here
to take you back to the city.

905
01:07:22.101 --> 01:07:24.469
I wouldn't try anything stupid.

906
01:07:24.502 --> 01:07:28.440
Back against the wall.

907
01:07:28.473 --> 01:07:30.742
That's good Private Cuntz.

908
01:07:30.775 --> 01:07:35.081
I couldn't stand another minute
in your shitty little town.

909
01:07:35.114 --> 01:07:37.884
That's...

910
01:07:37.917 --> 01:07:44.723
Constable
and it's pronounced Koontz.

911
01:07:50.062 --> 01:07:53.531
You sure do remind me of those
saucy little squaws

912
01:07:53.565 --> 01:07:57.970
from the reserve.

913
01:07:58.004 --> 01:08:00.006
Yes indeed.

914
01:08:00.039 --> 01:08:02.440
What the hell is going on
back there?

915
01:08:02.474 --> 01:08:04.676
Get Ms. Cardinal up here
toots sweet.

916
01:08:04.709 --> 01:08:06.811
Detective Karras has to get
her up to the big city.

917
01:08:06.846 --> 01:08:09.181
- Now!
- Next time I see you

918
01:08:09.215 --> 01:08:11.783
I'm going to split you in two.

919
01:08:11.816 --> 01:08:13.920
Yeah. I'll be right there boss.

920
01:08:13.953 --> 01:08:19.125
I just had to straighten
something out with our guest.

921
01:08:19.158 --> 01:08:21.793
You'll keep your mouth shut if
you know what's good for you.

922
01:08:27.699 --> 01:08:29.668
I don't think you can
paint all of the kids

923
01:08:29.701 --> 01:08:31.938
from the reservation
with the same brush.

924
01:08:31.971 --> 01:08:33.505
Bullshit I can't.

925
01:08:33.538 --> 01:08:34.983
They think they're some
kind of OG gangsters

926
01:08:35.007 --> 01:08:37.642
with their wrap crap
and are constantly stealing

927
01:08:37.676 --> 01:08:39.946
from the farms around here.
driving around stone

928
01:08:39.979 --> 01:08:42.248
with unregistered firearms
and causing trouble.

929
01:08:42.281 --> 01:08:45.583
They think they're Black
and from the slums of America.

930
01:08:45.617 --> 01:08:48.820
These kids have lost
their way and have no idea

931
01:08:48.854 --> 01:08:50.089
who they are.

932
01:08:50.122 --> 01:08:52.691
I blame their parents. myself.

933
01:08:52.724 --> 01:08:54.860
In fact. sure does remind me
of those low-lifes

934
01:08:54.894 --> 01:08:57.964
from the Red Fish Reserve.
yes indeed.

935
01:08:57.997 --> 01:09:02.068
Except I'm from E-Town
and I ain't a low-life.

936
01:09:02.101 --> 01:09:04.203
Save the lies for the court
there. sweetie.

937
01:09:04.236 --> 01:09:07.039
Yeah. okay. thank you very much
Sergeant.

938
01:09:07.073 --> 01:09:08.874
Come on.

939
01:09:08.908 --> 01:09:11.210
Have a pleasant evening.
Ms. Cardinal.

940
01:09:21.053 --> 01:09:23.956
You don't think they're going to
look for the boy. do you?

941
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:27.792
Who cares? We dropped the bunk
off deep in Crownland.

942
01:09:27.826 --> 01:09:30.029
no one's going to find him.

943
01:09:43.142 --> 01:09:44.809
Georgie.

944
01:09:44.844 --> 01:09:46.879
Can we get out of here
so I can get these off?

945
01:09:46.912 --> 01:09:48.613
- Like right now?
- The only reason

946
01:09:48.646 --> 01:09:50.249
they mentioned Derrick was
because

947
01:09:50.282 --> 01:09:53.052
of the criminal background
check.

948
01:09:53.085 --> 01:09:54.619
They weren't even
going to tell me

949
01:09:54.652 --> 01:09:57.023
that you were
in the back either.

950
01:09:57.056 --> 01:09:58.224
Wow.

951
01:09:58.257 --> 01:10:00.759
They're real charmers.

952
01:10:00.792 --> 01:10:02.794
Please. can we go?

953
01:10:02.827 --> 01:10:04.763
This place gives me the creeps.

954
01:10:04.796 --> 01:10:07.199
Something fierce.

955
01:10:07.233 --> 01:10:09.634
Why couldn't you just stay put?

956
01:10:09.667 --> 01:10:12.171
You went and you
fucked everything up.

957
01:10:12.204 --> 01:10:16.674
Oh-ho. swear word
from our boy in blue.

958
01:10:16.708 --> 01:10:18.844
Where's the cop cavalcade
promised?

959
01:10:18.878 --> 01:10:21.080
Well. the inspector said
that she needed more hard proof

960
01:10:21.113 --> 01:10:24.283
before she assigned
more officers.

961
01:10:24.316 --> 01:10:27.619
If they listened to me.

962
01:10:27.652 --> 01:10:30.622
Here.

963
01:10:30.655 --> 01:10:33.792
All of these red x's represent
where people went missing

964
01:10:33.825 --> 01:10:36.694
and it starts just
down the road from here.

965
01:10:36.728 --> 01:10:40.698
The usual stellar detective work
I've come to expect.

966
01:10:40.732 --> 01:10:42.234
We should find 'Kota in no time.

967
01:10:42.268 --> 01:10:45.237
It's not just women
that go missing here. Cardinal.

968
01:10:45.271 --> 01:10:47.940
Men go missing here too.

969
01:10:47.973 --> 01:10:50.843
Mostly from the reserve but...

970
01:10:50.876 --> 01:10:52.811
no one cares about
a bunch of Indian hookers

971
01:10:52.845 --> 01:10:55.281
- and town drunks.
- You think those pigs have

972
01:10:55.314 --> 01:10:56.949
something to do with it.
don't you?

973
01:10:56.982 --> 01:10:58.683
I don't have any hard proof.
but everything

974
01:10:58.716 --> 01:11:02.654
in my gut says yeah. they do.

975
01:11:02.687 --> 01:11:07.226
Look. I'd bet my badge that
they did something to Derrick.

976
01:11:07.259 --> 01:11:08.527
Maybe Lakota too.

977
01:11:08.561 --> 01:11:12.231
Then let's get the hell out of
here and start looking for them.

978
01:11:12.264 --> 01:11:13.833
Yeah.

979
01:11:13.866 --> 01:11:18.237
The highway will give us
a clue. it's got to.

980
01:11:27.745 --> 01:11:30.382
Ugh! Ugh!

981
01:11:34.286 --> 01:11:37.123
When I get out here I'm going to
kill both of you!

982
01:11:44.796 --> 01:11:48.400
You aren't even human!

983
01:11:48.434 --> 01:11:49.801
Ugh!

984
01:11:49.835 --> 01:11:51.736
Oh you deserve to die.

985
01:12:02.081 --> 01:12:05.184
No. but not me.

986
01:12:05.851 --> 01:12:08.387
No. I don't want to die.

987
01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:10.156
No I don't.

988
01:12:17.329 --> 01:12:21.300
I have to save Lakota.

989
01:12:23.903 --> 01:12:25.237
Who's there?

990
01:12:44.223 --> 01:12:47.792
Get off your ass boy
and stand like a man.

991
01:12:47.825 --> 01:12:51.130
Wait. who's there?

992
01:12:51.163 --> 01:12:54.867
I am Mahikhan
and I have come to help you.

993
01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:58.770
You have seen me before.
Derrick Desjardins.

994
01:12:58.803 --> 01:13:03.042
You're from my vision.

995
01:13:03.075 --> 01:13:04.410
I must be dead or dreaming.

996
01:13:04.443 --> 01:13:08.914
You're not dead yet
but Lakota is in extreme danger

997
01:13:08.948 --> 01:13:11.317
and it is up to you to save her.

998
01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:14.153
I could've saved her
if you would've stopped me.

999
01:13:14.186 --> 01:13:16.889
It is very dangerous
to enter the real world

1000
01:13:16.922 --> 01:13:21.360
when you are in a vision.

1001
01:13:21.393 --> 01:13:23.095
I'm not scared
of breaking through it

1002
01:13:23.128 --> 01:13:26.098
- if it means saving my sister.
- You should be.

1003
01:13:26.131 --> 01:13:29.235
You would be trapped between the
shadow world and yours forever.

1004
01:13:29.268 --> 01:13:31.870
But now it is time to take
control of your reality

1005
01:13:31.904 --> 01:13:33.872
and save Lakota.

1006
01:13:33.906 --> 01:13:36.075
I... I don't know where to go.

1007
01:13:36.108 --> 01:13:38.776
Abandoned in the middle
of nowhere

1008
01:13:38.810 --> 01:13:41.213
by the police
who want me to die. I...

1009
01:13:41.247 --> 01:13:45.317
Being a victim is getting
really old really fast. boy.

1010
01:13:45.351 --> 01:13:47.519
What you need is to start acting
like the man

1011
01:13:47.553 --> 01:13:48.887
you were meant to be.

1012
01:13:48.921 --> 01:13:51.457
You must lead and save Lakota.

1013
01:13:51.490 --> 01:13:52.824
Well. can you help me?

1014
01:13:52.858 --> 01:13:54.393
I don't know where to start.

1015
01:13:54.426 --> 01:13:55.961
Follow the moon.

1016
01:13:55.995 --> 01:13:57.863
You know the sign to look for.

1017
01:13:57.896 --> 01:13:59.498
The hunter is very close

1018
01:13:59.531 --> 01:14:02.935
and you don't have much time.

1019
01:14:02.968 --> 01:14:05.938
I know I may not
make it out of there

1020
01:14:05.971 --> 01:14:09.475
but if I can stop those killings

1021
01:14:09.508 --> 01:14:11.010
it will be worth my life.

1022
01:14:11.043 --> 01:14:14.812
Now that is a man
speaking to me.

1023
01:14:14.847 --> 01:14:17.483
W... wait!

1024
01:14:17.516 --> 01:14:19.817
What am I supposed to do
when I find him?

1025
01:14:19.852 --> 01:14:24.456
Save your sister and don't die.

1026
01:14:24.490 --> 01:14:27.293
Don't die.

1027
01:14:27.326 --> 01:14:30.062
Good advice.

1028
01:14:42.141 --> 01:14:43.575
Christ's sake. don't you think

1029
01:14:43.609 --> 01:14:45.577
you can get these handcuffs off.

1030
01:14:45.611 --> 01:14:49.181
Yeah that is
not going to happen.

1031
01:14:49.214 --> 01:14:50.592
Look. I've got enough problems
without you

1032
01:14:50.616 --> 01:14:55.921
running around unchained.

1033
01:14:55.954 --> 01:14:58.924
How the hell did you
start a fire in a motel?

1034
01:14:58.957 --> 01:15:02.027
Yeah. no.
we'll deal with that later.

1035
01:15:02.061 --> 01:15:05.364
Why didn't you stay in the city
when I asked you to?

1036
01:15:05.397 --> 01:15:08.300
You cost us hours
that we don't have. Cardinal.

1037
01:15:12.604 --> 01:15:16.942
Why weren't you there
when I needed you. Georgie?

1038
01:15:16.975 --> 01:15:19.945
You promised me
you'd be there for us.

1039
01:15:19.978 --> 01:15:22.281
I lost Danielle cause of you.

1040
01:15:22.314 --> 01:15:25.517
They still haven't found
her body.

1041
01:15:25.551 --> 01:15:29.888
She was my friend.

1042
01:15:29.922 --> 01:15:32.591
I didn't know.

1043
01:15:32.624 --> 01:15:35.127
Got to find Lakota too.
I can't have another woman's

1044
01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:38.097
blood on my hands.
I'm just trying to help.

1045
01:15:38.130 --> 01:15:41.233
So you want to help.
do you. Georgie?

1046
01:15:41.266 --> 01:15:44.036
You were there
for my gang all right.

1047
01:15:44.069 --> 01:15:48.240
Just like that. we were gone.

1048
01:15:48.273 --> 01:15:50.943
I lost two of my girls
after you left.

1049
01:15:50.976 --> 01:15:53.412
Left? Really?

1050
01:15:53.445 --> 01:15:55.247
We've been hunting down
a murderer that's been

1051
01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:57.583
abducting women
off these streets for ten years

1052
01:15:57.616 --> 01:15:59.218
and you think I just leave?

1053
01:15:59.251 --> 01:16:03.021
That wasn't the word
on the street.

1054
01:16:03.055 --> 01:16:04.456
- I heard...
- Look. I don't know

1055
01:16:04.490 --> 01:16:07.993
what happened. all I know
is I had everything set up

1056
01:16:08.026 --> 01:16:09.995
with my men in place
and you showed up

1057
01:16:10.028 --> 01:16:12.664
and you spooked them.
You spooked everybody.

1058
01:16:12.698 --> 01:16:15.000
You spooked my guys
and the suspect.

1059
01:16:15.033 --> 01:16:16.277
So you thought
I should just stand there

1060
01:16:16.301 --> 01:16:18.170
and wait for my girl
to get killed?

1061
01:16:18.203 --> 01:16:21.273
No. I just needed you
to stay put

1062
01:16:21.306 --> 01:16:23.308
until we found our suspect.

1063
01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:34.019
The investigator blames me
for blowing the case.

1064
01:16:34.052 --> 01:16:35.263
He pulled me off the street
and sent me

1065
01:16:35.287 --> 01:16:39.591
into Saint Josephs
for safe keeping.

1066
01:16:39.625 --> 01:16:43.262
I blamed you for everything.

1067
01:16:43.295 --> 01:16:46.331
After my divorce I just...

1068
01:16:46.365 --> 01:16:48.233
I realized that
I'm the one that's responsible

1069
01:16:48.267 --> 01:16:50.369
for everything
that happens to me.

1070
01:16:55.073 --> 01:16:57.476
I'm sorry.

1071
01:16:57.509 --> 01:16:58.677
From the bottom of my heart

1072
01:16:58.710 --> 01:17:00.579
I am sorry. Lisa.

1073
01:17:00.612 --> 01:17:03.382
I should've told you
that we were there to set up...

1074
01:17:03.415 --> 01:17:05.717
Georgie watch out!

1075
01:17:19.631 --> 01:17:25.003
I'd love to help you sweetie
but I have to save my sister.

1076
01:17:25.037 --> 01:17:27.206
I don't have time.

1077
01:17:27.239 --> 01:17:29.475
But I promise I'll be back
as soon as I can. okay?

1078
01:17:31.510 --> 01:17:32.711
Okay.

1079
01:17:36.815 --> 01:17:38.717
Fuck it.

1080
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:41.787
I'm saving you. my sister

1081
01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:44.356
and whoever else I can. okay?

1082
01:17:44.389 --> 01:17:46.258
All right.

1083
01:17:47.726 --> 01:17:49.561
Is anyone there?

1084
01:17:55.267 --> 01:17:56.502
Georgie!

1085
01:17:56.535 --> 01:17:57.469
Georgie. are you okay?

1086
01:17:57.503 --> 01:18:04.510
It's Officer Karras
and no. not really.

1087
01:18:04.543 --> 01:18:06.678
Ugh.

1088
01:18:06.712 --> 01:18:09.348
Desjardins.

1089
01:18:09.381 --> 01:18:13.385
Why did you disobey
my direct order to stay put?

1090
01:18:15.153 --> 01:18:19.458
I need to save my sister.

1091
01:18:19.491 --> 01:18:22.461
Officer Karras.
this is really important.

1092
01:18:22.494 --> 01:18:25.130
Where's Lisa. I need her help

1093
01:18:25.163 --> 01:18:27.599
and I'm almost out of time!

1094
01:18:27.633 --> 01:18:30.068
She's okay.

1095
01:18:30.102 --> 01:18:35.073
I bailed her out and then...

1096
01:18:35.107 --> 01:18:38.744
And then what? Where is she?

1097
01:18:42.514 --> 01:18:46.451
Stay.

1098
01:18:46.485 --> 01:18:48.820
I'll be back
for the both of you.

1099
01:18:48.855 --> 01:18:51.223
I promise.

1100
01:18:55.827 --> 01:18:57.296
Oh. Lisa.

1101
01:18:59.631 --> 01:19:00.799
Lisa.

1102
01:19:00.833 --> 01:19:02.334
Lisa.

1103
01:19:05.337 --> 01:19:07.874
Lisa. please wake up. please.

1104
01:19:07.907 --> 01:19:09.341
Lakota needs you.

1105
01:19:13.913 --> 01:19:15.747
God.

1106
01:19:15.781 --> 01:19:18.483
Please let this be
a bad dream or something.

1107
01:19:23.689 --> 01:19:29.361
I wish I could have saved you.

1108
01:19:29.394 --> 01:19:34.299
Like in the movies
and we could...

1109
01:19:34.333 --> 01:19:36.668
we could've had
a happy ending together but...

1110
01:19:42.341 --> 01:19:46.311
We all know that's not
going to happen.

1111
01:19:52.551 --> 01:19:55.520
I'm so sorry.

1112
01:19:55.554 --> 01:19:58.891
For not being there
for you when you needed me.

1113
01:20:46.906 --> 01:20:48.774
Goodbye Ms. Cardinal.

1114
01:22:11.090 --> 01:22:16.561
Now it's time to cleanse
the world and stop the pain.

1115
01:22:18.530 --> 01:22:22.567
One whore at a time.

1116
01:22:22.601 --> 01:22:23.836
Ah!

1117
01:22:25.537 --> 01:22:28.673
Ah!

1118
01:22:44.924 --> 01:22:46.859
You're insane. let me go.

1119
01:22:52.664 --> 01:22:58.637
This is all you wanted.
all you had to do was ask. boy.

1120
01:22:58.670 --> 01:23:01.807
Get off my sister.
you son of a bitch!

1121
01:23:01.841 --> 01:23:04.844
Lakota. get out of here!

1122
01:23:04.877 --> 01:23:06.946
Fuck that!

1123
01:23:06.979 --> 01:23:08.346
He's got this shit coming.

1124
01:23:26.132 --> 01:23:28.835
You don't have to do this.

1125
01:23:28.868 --> 01:23:30.069
Oh no.

1126
01:23:34.706 --> 01:23:38.743
It's almost over. can you feel
it. you sick son of a bitch?

1127
01:23:38.777 --> 01:23:41.981
Me and my brother.
we're going to get you.

1128
01:23:42.014 --> 01:23:46.484
Not until I've had it my way.

1129
01:23:46.518 --> 01:23:52.624
The pain will end with you.

1130
01:23:52.657 --> 01:23:53.926
Mother.

1131
01:25:16.842 --> 01:25:18.911
Lakota. hang on!

1132
01:25:18.945 --> 01:25:21.680
I'm coming!

1133
01:25:30.822 --> 01:25:32.224
No!

1134
01:25:42.268 --> 01:25:44.971
It's time. boy.

1135
01:25:45.004 --> 01:25:48.640
Time for you to join
the whore in her watery grave.

1136
01:25:59.151 --> 01:26:00.819
Ah!

1137
01:26:11.063 --> 01:26:14.000
Ah!

1138
01:26:31.616 --> 01:26:33.119
It's caused stressed healing

1139
01:26:33.152 --> 01:26:36.288
making the bone underneath
to become very brittle.

1140
01:26:39.791 --> 01:26:42.294
Up.

1141
01:26:46.332 --> 01:26:48.134
Ugh!

1142
01:26:50.269 --> 01:26:51.937
Ugh!

1143
01:27:13.926 --> 01:27:17.329
Lakota! Lakota!

1144
01:27:17.363 --> 01:27:18.931
Lakota!

1145
01:27:18.964 --> 01:27:21.033
Oh no.

1146
01:27:21.067 --> 01:27:24.236
Come on. come on.

1147
01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:29.375
No. no.

1148
01:27:29.408 --> 01:27:34.046
God if I have to give my last
breath to save you I will.

1149
01:27:42.254 --> 01:27:43.822
Jesus. if you weren't my brother

1150
01:27:43.856 --> 01:27:46.292
I'd kill you
for touching me like that!

1151
01:27:46.325 --> 01:27:48.961
I'm so glad that you're okay.

1152
01:27:48.994 --> 01:27:51.897
You're still
a pain in my ass though.

1153
01:27:53.798 --> 01:27:56.135
I love you more than you know.
neechie.

1154
01:27:56.168 --> 01:27:57.203
Thank you.

1155
01:27:57.236 --> 01:27:58.838
Stop right there.

1156
01:27:58.871 --> 01:28:01.639
Put your hands
where I can see them.

1157
01:28:01.673 --> 01:28:04.977
Get away from her. step back.

1158
01:28:05.010 --> 01:28:06.687
Been investigating
the Road of Tears for years.

1159
01:28:06.711 --> 01:28:08.680
looks like I finally
got my big break.

1160
01:28:08.713 --> 01:28:10.682
I found that car
that you ran off the road.

1161
01:28:10.715 --> 01:28:13.252
What? No you're going
to kill her too?

1162
01:28:13.285 --> 01:28:16.255
That dead girl in the ditch
beside the car.

1163
01:28:16.288 --> 01:28:18.057
that's the end of the line.

1164
01:28:18.090 --> 01:28:21.193
Dead girl?

1165
01:28:21.227 --> 01:28:25.064
Lisa didn't make it.

1166
01:28:25.097 --> 01:28:26.999
I tried saving everyone.

1167
01:28:31.803 --> 01:28:34.806
You better start talking quick.

1168
01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:40.146
I came here to save my sister.
Lakota. okay.

1169
01:28:40.179 --> 01:28:45.217
And that dead girl. the woman
you found in the ditch?

1170
01:28:45.251 --> 01:28:48.087
Yeah. her name was Lisa Cardinal

1171
01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:52.424
and she was our friend.

1172
01:28:52.458 --> 01:28:56.162
Oh Jesus this remind me
of Rawanda.

1173
01:28:56.195 --> 01:28:59.431
Someone's been a busy boy.
where the hell is he?

1174
01:29:06.005 --> 01:29:08.806
It's Symenko.
I need a full forensic team.

1175
01:29:08.841 --> 01:29:10.318
I'm going to need divers
to comb the lake.

1176
01:29:10.342 --> 01:29:12.777
I need air support.
just whatever you can spare.

1177
01:29:12.810 --> 01:29:14.180
There's a lot of bodies
out here.

1178
01:29:14.213 --> 01:29:17.749
Excuse me officers.
can we put our arms down now?

1179
01:29:17.782 --> 01:29:20.119
Lower your weapon.

1180
01:29:20.152 --> 01:29:21.854
Hold on. you better
get that looked at.

1181
01:29:21.887 --> 01:29:25.324
You lost a lot of blood.

1182
01:29:25.357 --> 01:29:27.126
I need an ambulance
down here right away.

1183
01:29:27.159 --> 01:29:29.862
- Don't die on me!
- We got a man going into shock.

1184
01:29:30.863 --> 01:29:35.000
Make it happen.

1185
01:29:44.043 --> 01:29:46.378
There he is.
the hero of the hour.

1186
01:29:46.412 --> 01:29:48.881
We came as soon as we heard.

1187
01:29:48.914 --> 01:29:50.482
How are you feeling?

1188
01:29:50.516 --> 01:29:52.952
The doctor said
you lost so much blood.

1189
01:29:52.985 --> 01:29:56.355
Uh. no. I'm okay.

1190
01:29:56.388 --> 01:29:59.391
I'm better than the other guy.
that's for sure.

1191
01:29:59.425 --> 01:30:01.961
How are you. Kôhkom?

1192
01:30:01.994 --> 01:30:04.997
You know. I was pretty scared
when you left.

1193
01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:07.466
It was touch and go for a while

1194
01:30:07.499 --> 01:30:10.102
but Ogichidaa. the medicine man.

1195
01:30:10.135 --> 01:30:12.338
was able to draw out
my sickness.

1196
01:30:12.371 --> 01:30:16.242
I'm much better now.

1197
01:30:16.275 --> 01:30:17.843
A gift.

1198
01:30:17.876 --> 01:30:20.913
To replace the one
you lost in battle.

1199
01:30:20.946 --> 01:30:22.982
How do you know what happened?

1200
01:30:23.015 --> 01:30:26.085
I can see many things.
I can teach you too.

1201
01:30:26.118 --> 01:30:28.854
Not until the doctor
says he can leave.

1202
01:30:28.887 --> 01:30:30.389
Of course. there will be things

1203
01:30:30.422 --> 01:30:31.991
we gotta take care of first.

1204
01:30:32.024 --> 01:30:33.959
You ready for the red path?

1205
01:30:33.993 --> 01:30:36.262
Keeper of the fire.

1206
01:30:36.295 --> 01:30:39.531
Ogimaa...

1207
01:30:39.565 --> 01:30:41.934
any offer of help
is appreciated.

1208
01:30:41.967 --> 01:30:45.237
Accepting help is an excellent
first step to healing.

1209
01:30:48.507 --> 01:30:50.843
I was so scared for you Lakota.

1210
01:30:50.876 --> 01:30:54.113
I thought I might
never see you again.

1211
01:30:54.146 --> 01:30:58.584
Like a bad penny.
I just keep coming back.

1212
01:30:58.617 --> 01:31:00.386
I'm so sorry. Kôhkom.

1213
01:31:03.522 --> 01:31:06.558
It's okay. noozhishenh.

1214
01:31:06.592 --> 01:31:10.296
We're a family again.

1215
01:31:10.329 --> 01:31:12.031
Whole once more.
