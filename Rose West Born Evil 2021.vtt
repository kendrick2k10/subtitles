872

Bill and Daisy would go on
to have seven children.

874

a secret diagnosis

875
00:40:01.468 --> 00:40:05.886
that would cause
his paranoia to intensify.

876
00:40:05.989 --> 00:40:10.546
-Bill was said to have
severe psychotic episodes.

877
00:40:10.649 --> 00:40:15.516
He had been diagnosed
as a paranoid schizophrenic

878
00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:17.587
when he was a teenager

879
00:40:17.691 --> 00:40:22.109
and that had never been
disclosed to the family

880
00:40:22.212 --> 00:40:24.422
and he remained untreated.

881
00:40:24.525 --> 00:40:26.216
He would think people
were talking about him

882
00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:28.943
and have a go at his wife
all the time.

883
00:40:29.047 --> 00:40:30.393
If she was even talking
to the neighbors.

884
00:40:30.497 --> 00:40:32.153

and pull her in.

Nothing happened.

and shout and thrash them.

-In fear of violence from Bill.

891

an obsession

892

became so intense

were not allowed out.

and shouted at him.

1385
01:02:46.348 --> 01:02:49.835
And that was the moment when
the jury could see what she was.

1386
01:02:49.938 --> 01:02:52.665

-We perhaps had tended to want
to think

1392
01:03:11.995 --> 01:03:14.791

person who was just

an active participant.

1396

could have imagined.

out the verdict of guilty.
