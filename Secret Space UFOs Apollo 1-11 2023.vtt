[glasses clinking]

5
00:00:12.184 --> 00:00:13.530
- [Gene Cernan] I put the binocu

6
00:00:13.565 --> 00:00:15.705
and I can see it spinning around

7
00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:18.777
and I wouldn't bet my
life on it being the S4B.

8
00:00:18.811 --> 00:00:21.745
but it sure has gotta
be something like it.

9
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.714
- [Reporter] That was Gene
Cernan reporting that sighting.

10
00:00:24.748 --> 00:00:25.577
Orbit

11
00:00:26.785 --> 00:00:28.442
- We were that first crew
that was going to get a chance

12
00:00:28.476 --> 00:00:31.997
to fly this vehicle and test thi

13
00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:36.105
that was going to take
human beings to the Moon.

14
00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:38.935
[dramatic music]

15
00:00:48.496 --> 00:00:50.843
- [Narrator] Mankind makes one g

16
00:00:50.878 --> 00:00:53.329
and lands the first man on the M

17
00:00:53.363 --> 00:00:55.883
a historic achievement for the h

18
00:00:57.298 --> 00:01:01.716
But that giant leap took
many lunges. trips and falls

19
00:01:01.751 --> 00:01:04.892
in order for our astronauts to
actually achieve this moment.

20
00:01:06.135 --> 00:01:10.035
And along the way. many space
researchers have speculated

21
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.970
that our astronauts may have see

22
00:01:14.004 --> 00:01:17.042
and anomalous structures
on the surface of the Moon.

23
00:01:22.496 --> 00:01:23.600
- You know. we have a.

24
00:01:23.635 --> 00:01:27.156
it's a very interesting
little document from 1950.

25
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.881
there was a Canadian government

26
00:01:28.916 --> 00:01:29.917
named Wilbert Smith.

27
00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:33.955
and he was very interested
in these flying saucers.

28
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.923
Wilbert Smith was a real smart g

29
00:01:35.957 --> 00:01:37.649
He was an engineer. he was a sci

30
00:01:37.683 --> 00:01:40.548
and he had a kind of a
mid-upper level position

31
00:01:40.583 --> 00:01:42.240
in the Canadian bureaucracy

32
00:01:42.274 --> 00:01:45.346
and he was able to go
down to Washington DC

33
00:01:45.381 --> 00:01:47.831
in September. 1950 to the
Canadian Embassy there.

34
00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:51.835
And while he was hanging
around DC he goes and talks

35
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.149
to some American scientists
and one in particular.

36
00:01:55.184 --> 00:01:58.463
And this was a scientist who
was very well plugged in.

37
00:01:59.498 --> 00:02:02.743
and this man. man whose
name was Robert Sarbacher.

38
00:02:02.777 --> 00:02:04.158
we learned many years later.

39
00:02:05.055 --> 00:02:07.092
It was very. very powerful.

40
00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:10.647
Sarbacher says. yes.
flying sauces do exist.

41
00:02:10.682 --> 00:02:12.856
I can confirm that for you.

42
00:02:12.891 --> 00:02:15.100
Their modus operandi is unknown.

43
00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:16.860
but the United States government

44
00:02:16.895 --> 00:02:20.830
this the most classified subject

45
00:02:20.864 --> 00:02:24.489
of all two levels higher
than the hydrogen bomb.

46
00:02:24.523 --> 00:02:28.078
which in 1950 was about
as big as you could get.

47
00:02:28.113 --> 00:02:30.115
but flying saucers were higher t

48
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.428
So Smith types up this
memo for his supervisors

49
00:02:32.462 --> 00:02:36.535
in the Canadian government.
and. uh. that's that.

50
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.881
But actually. that wasn't that.

51
00:02:37.916 --> 00:02:40.263
because years after he died.

52
00:02:40.298 --> 00:02:43.922
his private papers were analyzed

53
00:02:43.956 --> 00:02:48.616
and the exact name of that
scientist was written there.

54
00:02:48.651 --> 00:02:52.206
And that scientist. Robert
Sarbacher was still alive

55
00:02:52.241 --> 00:02:53.276
and researchers found him.

56
00:02:53.311 --> 00:02:55.899
Sarbacher confirmed the
whole thing.

57
00:02:55.934 --> 00:02:58.385
He said. "Yeah. that actually
did happen."

58
00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:00.697
So anyway. my point simply is.

59
00:03:00.732 --> 00:03:06.531
you've got very clear knowledge
among the highest

60
00:03:07.497 --> 00:03:12.053
circles in Washington back
in 1950. for example.

61
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.473
And in the military
back in 1950 that. yes.

62
00:03:17.507 --> 00:03:21.235
absolutely UFOs were the most
sensitive subject out there.

63
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.410
Now. ask yourself.
why would that be.

64
00:03:24.652 --> 00:03:27.241
You know. why would that be the
most sensitive subject

65
00:03:27.276 --> 00:03:30.244
if it was all nonsense and
hallucinations

66
00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:32.453
and hoaxes and things like this?
You know?

67
00:03:33.282 --> 00:03:36.423
Well. obviously it's a lot
more than that.

68
00:03:36.457 --> 00:03:38.908
And when you go through
the declassified literature

69
00:03:38.942 --> 00:03:41.842
such that we have. there's
still a lot we don't have.

70
00:03:41.876 --> 00:03:45.363
but we have enough to
show very. very clearly

71
00:03:45.397 --> 00:03:48.676
you had countless violations
of sensitive aerospace

72
00:03:48.711 --> 00:03:50.851
by objects that did not
look normal. that were not.

73
00:03:50.885 --> 00:03:54.337
that were doing things that
were not supposed to be possible

74
00:03:55.407 --> 00:03:58.238
over places that you were
never supposed to go.

75
00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.517
Alright. whether that means
over Los Alamos. you know.

76
00:04:01.551 --> 00:04:03.898
where the scientists
developed the atomic bomb

77
00:04:03.933 --> 00:04:07.177
or the Hanford Nuclear Plant
in the state of Washington.

78
00:04:07.212 --> 00:04:11.734
which was a major plutonium
processing facility.

79
00:04:12.113 --> 00:04:14.288
a lot of toxic waste
there to this day.

80
00:04:14.323 --> 00:04:18.775
Or over the Oak Ridge. uh.
nuclear facility in Tennessee

81
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.950
where again. a great
deal of science

82
00:04:20.984 --> 00:04:24.022
on the atomic bomb
was developed.

83
00:04:24.056 --> 00:04:25.368
All of these very
sensitive places.

84
00:04:25.403 --> 00:04:27.094
you don't just go
hang out over them.

85
00:04:27.128 --> 00:04:28.889
but UFOs were hanging
out over them

86
00:04:29.786 --> 00:04:32.444
and. you know. jets would
be sent to intercept.

87
00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:34.929
In one case. we know of

88
00:04:34.964 --> 00:04:37.277
anti-aircraft battalions
were alerted.

89
00:04:37.967 --> 00:04:39.209
You know. [laughs]

90
00:04:39.244 --> 00:04:41.764
Can you imagine if the public
knew about this at the time?

91
00:04:42.523 --> 00:04:43.904
They didn't. they didn't
find out

92
00:04:43.938 --> 00:04:45.181
until years and years later

93
00:04:45.215 --> 00:04:47.287
after these documents were
declassified.

94
00:04:47.321 --> 00:04:48.253
By then. they were just sunk

95
00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:50.738
into the black hole of
the public memory

96
00:04:50.773 --> 00:04:53.327
and. you know. no one really
seemed to care.

97
00:04:53.362 --> 00:04:56.744
But back in 1950. if these
incidents had become known.

98
00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:59.160
I think people would've cared
quite a bit.

99
00:04:59.195 --> 00:05:00.852
Uh. they were very important.

100
00:05:00.886 --> 00:05:03.337
My point here simply is this.

101
00:05:03.372 --> 00:05:08.342
the subject of UFOs has
always been considered

102
00:05:08.687 --> 00:05:13.313
to be of the highest level
of security classification

103
00:05:13.347 --> 00:05:14.693
that we know of.

104
00:05:14.728 --> 00:05:17.593
And so now. if you've got NASA

105
00:05:19.284 --> 00:05:24.462
engaged in any capacity with
the United States military

106
00:05:24.496 --> 00:05:27.913
on any type of classified
mission that it engages in.

107
00:05:27.948 --> 00:05:31.779
there is no way ever

108
00:05:31.814 --> 00:05:34.851
that they're just gonna
tell the world.

109
00:05:34.886 --> 00:05:38.234
oh look. there are all
these UFOs. people.

110
00:05:38.268 --> 00:05:39.373
How cool is that?

111
00:05:39.408 --> 00:05:41.479
Now. that will never happen.

112
00:05:41.513 --> 00:05:45.310
That will never happen
until the laws change

113
00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:47.381
and those laws haven't changed.

114
00:05:47.416 --> 00:05:49.556
This subject still
remains highly classified

115
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.351
even well into the 21st century.

116
00:05:51.385 --> 00:05:52.179
It is...

117
00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:54.595
You know. we can talk a little
bit more about it now

118
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.079
than say a few years ago.

119
00:05:56.114 --> 00:05:57.978
That's interesting and
that's true.

120
00:05:58.875 --> 00:06:01.878
but there's... you know.
there's still a red line

121
00:06:01.913 --> 00:06:03.949
and thou shall not go over
that red line.

122
00:06:15.892 --> 00:06:17.549
- It was one of these
clear. clear days

123
00:06:17.584 --> 00:06:18.619
and that's why I was up.

124
00:06:18.654 --> 00:06:21.311
because you could
see to infiniti.

125
00:06:21.346 --> 00:06:24.004
and it was an ideal day
for aerial photography.

126
00:06:24.038 --> 00:06:26.903
And it appeared silver
with a shadow underneath

127
00:06:26.938 --> 00:06:28.698
There's always metallic.

128
00:06:28.733 --> 00:06:30.355
And it was moving at
a rate of speed.

129
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.394
I would say 150 miles
an hour plus or minus.

130
00:06:34.428 --> 00:06:37.983
And appeared to be maybe
20 meters across.

131
00:06:38.018 --> 00:06:40.641
- [Speaker] We decided to
analyze the Catalina film.

132
00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:43.506
- And there seems to
be some holes

133
00:06:43.541 --> 00:06:46.302
or some kind of transparency
underneath here.

134
00:06:46.336 --> 00:06:48.097
One takes a good look at this

135
00:06:48.131 --> 00:06:50.340
and considering that
the speed of the object

136
00:06:52.066 --> 00:06:54.759
as reported by Lee
Hansen. the photographer.

137
00:06:54.793 --> 00:06:58.003
is that this is moving at
about 120 miles an hour.

138
00:06:58.038 --> 00:07:01.593
This begins to look like a
small commercial airplane.

139
00:07:01.628 --> 00:07:03.250
and one can draw the comparison

140
00:07:03.284 --> 00:07:05.770
that you have the
bright wing on the top.

141
00:07:05.804 --> 00:07:10.360
the windows and the flyer.
the rudder structure.

142
00:07:10.395 --> 00:07:11.776
and that's it.

143
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.605
The Catalina film. I'm afraid.

144
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.540
falls into the category of an
identified flying airplane.

145
00:07:17.575 --> 00:07:20.232
[ominous music]

146
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.346
[dramatic music]

147
00:07:42.496 --> 00:07:43.497
- [Narrator] The Lunar Orbiter
missions

148
00:07:43.532 --> 00:07:46.638
were initiated in early 1964

149
00:07:46.673 --> 00:07:50.262
and consisted of five
identical unmanned spacecraft

150
00:07:50.297 --> 00:07:52.851
to investigate the surface
of the Moon.

151
00:07:52.886 --> 00:07:56.199
The main purpose of the
program was to locate

152
00:07:56.234 --> 00:07:59.651
smooth level areas on the
Moon's near side

153
00:07:59.686 --> 00:08:03.275
to confirm the areas as suitable
for manned landing sites

154
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.208
for the Apollo program.

155
00:08:05.243 --> 00:08:07.832
Other program objectives
were to collect data

156
00:08:07.866 --> 00:08:09.661
on the Moon's gravitational
field

157
00:08:09.696 --> 00:08:12.664
to provide precision
trajectory information

158
00:08:12.699 --> 00:08:15.736
and study radiation
and micrometeoroid flux

159
00:08:15.771 --> 00:08:17.324
in the vicinity of the Moon.

160
00:08:18.256 --> 00:08:21.259
The Orbiter took pictures
of the Moon's surface.

161
00:08:21.293 --> 00:08:23.779
more than 90% of the
pictures taken

162
00:08:23.813 --> 00:08:25.884
were transmitted successfully.

163
00:08:25.919 --> 00:08:28.646
including the historic
Earth rise.

164
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:33.305
taken from the Moon on
August 23rd. 1966.

165
00:08:47.596 --> 00:08:50.668
The Orbiter also obtained
environmental data

166
00:08:50.702 --> 00:08:52.773
during all periods of visibility

167
00:08:54.119 --> 00:08:56.950
Some photographs were
not transmitted.

168
00:08:56.984 --> 00:08:59.262
However. when the
transmitting equipment failed

169
00:08:59.297 --> 00:09:01.092
during the readout operation.

170
00:09:01.126 --> 00:09:03.888
only a small number of
pictures were lost

171
00:09:03.922 --> 00:09:07.408
and other data collection
was not affected.

172
00:09:07.443 --> 00:09:10.515
Lunar Orbiter 2 made
significant additions

173
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.967
to the techniques and data
required to land on the Moon.

174
00:09:14.001 --> 00:09:17.211
Mission 3 differed from
the previous two missions

175
00:09:17.246 --> 00:09:19.869
in that it was a
site-confirmation mission

176
00:09:19.904 --> 00:09:22.182
rather than a
site-selection mission.

177
00:09:26.496 --> 00:09:30.397
Despite some operational
problems during the mission.

178
00:09:30.431 --> 00:09:32.399
Orbiter 4 was highly successful

179
00:09:32.433 --> 00:09:33.987
in fulfilling its purpose.

180
00:09:35.264 --> 00:09:39.302
The photographs obtained.
provided information and detail

181
00:09:39.337 --> 00:09:43.410
at least 10 times better than
Earth-based observations.

182
00:09:43.444 --> 00:09:46.447
The photography captured
during Mission 5

183
00:09:46.482 --> 00:09:50.728
was an incredible improvement
in resolution from Mission 4.

184
00:09:50.762 --> 00:09:53.075
This allowed NASA to
gain better insight

185
00:09:53.109 --> 00:09:56.423
into sites of interest on
the near side of the Moon.

186
00:09:57.769 --> 00:10:00.600
The far side photography
provided coverage

187
00:10:00.634 --> 00:10:03.533
of essentially all areas not cov

188
00:10:03.568 --> 00:10:05.535
during the preceding
four missions.

189
00:10:11.783 --> 00:10:15.580
In the early two thousands.
a former Air Force technician

190
00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:18.894
specializing in
photographic printer repair.

191
00:10:18.928 --> 00:10:22.483
made a shocking statement to
the public about his experience

192
00:10:22.518 --> 00:10:25.763
while working for the
NSA during the 1960s.

193
00:10:25.797 --> 00:10:29.007
- I said. who's. what do you
mean who's.

194
00:10:29.042 --> 00:10:31.009
He said. yes. there's.
we've discovered

195
00:10:31.044 --> 00:10:32.632
a base on the backside
of the Moon.

196
00:10:32.666 --> 00:10:36.739
And at that point I
became frightened.

197
00:10:36.774 --> 00:10:40.847
- [Narrator] Another now famous
unidentified lunar object

198
00:10:40.881 --> 00:10:45.610
was spotted by the Lunar
Orbiter 3 in February of 1967.

199
00:10:46.542 --> 00:10:50.442
a total of 149 medium resolution

200
00:10:50.477 --> 00:10:54.205
and 477 high resolution frames

201
00:10:54.239 --> 00:10:56.586
were returned from this mission.

202
00:10:56.621 --> 00:10:58.692
And in one composite image.

203
00:10:58.727 --> 00:11:02.420
an object known as The Shard
can be seen.

204
00:11:02.454 --> 00:11:06.355
This object was supposedly
located between the Bruce Crater

205
00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:09.599
and the Sinus midi mare
plain area of the Moon.

206
00:11:10.531 --> 00:11:12.706
NASA has never acknowledged
this phenomenon.

207
00:11:16.745 --> 00:11:19.471
[dramatic music]

208
00:11:28.066 --> 00:11:31.691
[dramatic music continues]

209
00:11:40.113 --> 00:11:42.425
- And then he pulled out
one of these mosaics

210
00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:47.051
and showed this base which
had geometric shapes.

211
00:11:47.085 --> 00:11:51.745
There were towers. there
were spherical buildings.

212
00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.506
There were very tall towers
and things

213
00:11:54.541 --> 00:11:56.508
that looked somewhat
like radar dishes.

214
00:11:56.543 --> 00:11:58.683
but they were large structures.

215
00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:02.307
[dramatic music continues]

216
00:12:09.176 --> 00:12:12.939
So it was rare that someone
would do something like this.

217
00:12:12.973 --> 00:12:14.768
but this fellow and I were
the same rank.

218
00:12:14.803 --> 00:12:18.082
I think he was very distressed.

219
00:12:18.116 --> 00:12:20.291
He had the same power
and demeanor

220
00:12:20.325 --> 00:12:21.844
as the scientists outside
the room.

221
00:12:21.879 --> 00:12:24.329
They were just as concerned
as he was

222
00:12:24.364 --> 00:12:27.885
and he needed to discuss
it with somebody.

223
00:12:27.919 --> 00:12:30.508
So. that was the end of
it right there.

224
00:12:30.542 --> 00:12:33.097
I didn't take it any further
than that.

225
00:12:33.131 --> 00:12:36.548
I just filed it away.

226
00:12:36.583 --> 00:12:40.414
But the interesting thing.
every day that I went home.

227
00:12:40.449 --> 00:12:41.415
I would think to myself.

228
00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:43.901
I can't wait to hear
about this on the news.

229
00:12:45.626 --> 00:12:48.181
So I'd turn on the TV
and I'd look at the news

230
00:12:48.215 --> 00:12:50.700
to see if they're gonna
announce we've discovered a base

231
00:12:50.735 --> 00:12:53.703
on the back side of the
Moon being really naive.

232
00:12:54.981 --> 00:12:57.535
And of course. here it
is 30 some years later.

233
00:12:57.569 --> 00:12:59.433
and we still haven't
heard about it.

234
00:13:00.641 --> 00:13:03.437
- Researcher and filmmaker.
James Fox.

235
00:13:03.472 --> 00:13:05.267
started his journey into UFOs

236
00:13:06.164 --> 00:13:08.822
through Apollo astronaut
testimony.

237
00:13:08.857 --> 00:13:13.275
- Basically. out of this
whole UFO phenomenon.

238
00:13:14.172 --> 00:13:18.314
when did you become
interested in the idea

239
00:13:18.349 --> 00:13:23.354
that NASA astronauts
have seen UFOs in space

240
00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:26.978
and that possibly had been
covered up?

241
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:31.017
- I never did. until I
wasn't like

242
00:13:31.051 --> 00:13:35.573
actively looking for UFOs
in space. NASA.

243
00:13:38.024 --> 00:13:42.511
I watched an interview
in the early nineties

244
00:13:42.545 --> 00:13:44.789
with Apollo 14 astronaut
Edgar Mitchell.

245
00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:46.687
sixth man to walk the Moon.

246
00:13:46.722 --> 00:13:50.657
And he talked about UFOs
very openly. and I thought.

247
00:13:50.691 --> 00:13:52.417
here's a man who's got
everything to lose

248
00:13:52.452 --> 00:13:54.903
and nothing to gain by
what he's doing.

249
00:13:54.937 --> 00:13:57.595
- [Reporter] It's the sort of
disclosure UFO investigators

250
00:13:57.629 --> 00:14:00.356
are demanding from the
US government.

251
00:14:00.391 --> 00:14:01.771
How would people react?

252
00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:05.637
- That would be kind of
good it's about time.

253
00:14:05.672 --> 00:14:07.018
- [Reporter] Former
astronaut. Edgar Mitchell.

254
00:14:07.053 --> 00:14:09.572
is the sixth man to walk
on the Moon

255
00:14:09.607 --> 00:14:11.643
and a firm believer that aliens

256
00:14:11.678 --> 00:14:14.405
have visited our planet
repeatedly.

257
00:14:14.439 --> 00:14:15.889
So I had to ask.

258
00:14:15.924 --> 00:14:18.961
why are they coming in
these little glancing visits

259
00:14:18.996 --> 00:14:22.137
and we haven't had a
more meaningful dialogue

260
00:14:22.171 --> 00:14:24.656
or contact or attempt to
communicate with these people?

261
00:14:24.691 --> 00:14:26.037
- Well. I think we have.

262
00:14:26.072 --> 00:14:27.211
- [Reporter] Really?

263
00:14:27.245 --> 00:14:30.248
- I think we have. but it
is not common knowledge.

264
00:14:30.283 --> 00:14:31.318
- [Reporter] Mitchell told
me after

265
00:14:31.353 --> 00:14:32.664
he returned from the Moon.

266
00:14:32.699 --> 00:14:35.944
he was briefed at the Pentagon
by a high ranking officer.

267
00:14:35.978 --> 00:14:37.842
whose name he would not reveal.

268
00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:40.845
who said the US government
does have evidence

269
00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.745
of alien spacecraft and
is keeping it a secret.

270
00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:45.815
- Well. I think the real reason

271
00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:48.370
it is still a secret is power
and control.

272
00:14:48.404 --> 00:14:51.062
controlling whatever
technology exists.

273
00:14:51.097 --> 00:14:53.030
- [Reporter] All of this
is fascinating stuff.

274
00:14:53.064 --> 00:14:54.238
if it is true.

275
00:14:54.272 --> 00:14:57.344
- I mean. I've talked
to government insiders

276
00:14:57.379 --> 00:14:58.483
and intelligence folks

277
00:14:58.518 --> 00:15:00.969
and they kinda laugh at it.

278
00:15:01.003 --> 00:15:02.936
but obviously. they have
secret craft

279
00:15:02.971 --> 00:15:05.007
that we don't know about.
that's obvious.

280
00:15:05.042 --> 00:15:07.285
But whether they have
successfully reversed engineered

281
00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.942
what they've recovered
in Roswell.

282
00:15:08.977 --> 00:15:13.567
that's something that I have
not seen the evidence for.

283
00:15:13.602 --> 00:15:15.949
I'm not saying definitively
that it didn't happen.

284
00:15:15.984 --> 00:15:18.055
that they weren't successfully
reverse engineered.

285
00:15:18.089 --> 00:15:20.229
I have seen zero evidence of it.

286
00:15:20.264 --> 00:15:22.335
That's just me and
people can disagree

287
00:15:22.369 --> 00:15:23.888
all they want and that's fine.

288
00:15:25.338 --> 00:15:27.857

[dramatic music continues]

295
00:16:34.062 --> 00:16:37.030
- [Narrator] The Apollo missions
began in an irregular way

296
00:16:37.065 --> 00:16:40.033
compared to the previous
man capsule missions.

297
00:16:40.068 --> 00:16:42.104
This turned out disastrous

298
00:16:42.139 --> 00:16:44.486
for the first Apollo 1
test pilots.

299
00:16:46.453 --> 00:16:50.043
Apollo 2 and 3. which
were unmanned.

300
00:16:50.078 --> 00:16:54.944
were called AS-202 and
AS-203 respectively.

301
00:16:54.979 --> 00:16:57.395
in which the newly designed
Apollo capsule

302
00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:00.847
was married to the Saturn
1B rocket vehicle system.

July 5th. 1966.
an unmanned flight

304
00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.890
of the Saturn 1B rocket.

305
00:17:09.925 --> 00:17:12.790
it carried no command
and service module

306
00:17:12.824 --> 00:17:15.551
as its purpose was to
verify the design

307
00:17:15.586 --> 00:17:19.383
of the S4B rocket stage
restart capability.

308
00:17:19.417 --> 00:17:21.937
This would later be used
in the Apollo program

309
00:17:21.971 --> 00:17:24.422
to boost astronauts from
Earth orbit

310
00:17:24.457 --> 00:17:26.079
on a trajectory to the Moon.

311
00:17:26.114 --> 00:17:28.047
It achieved its goals.

312
00:17:28.081 --> 00:17:31.878
but the stage was inadvertently
destroyed after four orbits.

313
00:17:33.983 --> 00:17:38.022
Launched unmanned on
August 25th. 1966

314
00:17:38.057 --> 00:17:42.164
by a Saturn 1B vector
and suborbital flight.

315
00:17:42.199 --> 00:17:44.235
this flight was used to
perform tests

316
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:46.513
on the command and
service module.

317
00:17:46.548 --> 00:17:48.998
which was later
recovered destined

318
00:17:49.033 --> 00:17:51.311
to perform a man landing
on the Moon.

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:03.806
On January 27th. 1967
at Launchpad 34

00:18:05.636 --> 00:18:08.639
astronauts Grissom. White
and Chaffee

322
00:18:08.673 --> 00:18:13.264
were sealed inside of their
spacecraft for a plugs out test.

323
00:18:19.822 --> 00:18:23.102
The spacecraft was
pressurized with pure oxygen.

324
00:18:23.136 --> 00:18:25.207
Numerous communication problems

325
00:18:25.242 --> 00:18:28.003
were encountered during the test

[radio static crackling]

328
00:18:41.085 --> 00:18:43.018
- [Narrator] Suddenly
a spark occurred

329
00:18:43.052 --> 00:18:44.606
in the wiring of the
spacecraft

330
00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:46.401
somewhere below Grissom's feet.

331
00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:50.439
In the pure oxygen atmosphere.
the fire

332
00:18:50.474 --> 00:18:54.029
flashed through the spacecraft
consuming anything flammable.

333
00:18:58.896 --> 00:19:02.520
The crews struggled to open the
hatch of the command module.

334
00:19:02.555 --> 00:19:05.627
It was a complex task that
required too much time.

335
00:19:09.596 --> 00:19:11.529
Before they could open
the hatch.

336
00:19:11.564 --> 00:19:14.463
the fumes given off from
the fire asphyxiated them.

337

[radio static crackling]

342
00:19:41.559 --> 00:19:44.562
- One thing to take note of
about the Apollo 1 mission

343
00:19:44.597 --> 00:19:47.738
is that many of the
astronauts were very nervous

344
00:19:47.772 --> 00:19:52.260
about this Apollo spacecraft
and its rapid buildup.

345
00:19:52.294 --> 00:19:57.092
Concurrently with the Gemini
mission still being finished.

346
00:19:58.266 --> 00:19:59.543
Many of the astronauts
were being

347
00:19:59.577 --> 00:20:01.821
swapped over to the
Apollo mission

348
00:20:01.855 --> 00:20:06.205
and this rapid buildup
looked like

349
00:20:06.239 --> 00:20:08.621
it was going to cause
malfunctions

350
00:20:08.655 --> 00:20:11.969
and errors to that spacecraft.

351
00:20:12.003 --> 00:20:16.456
Walter Schirra. he actually
commented to Gus Grissom.

352
00:20:16.491 --> 00:20:20.805
one of the pilots of
the early Gemini project

353
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.912
that had been swapped
over to Apollo 1.

354
00:20:23.946 --> 00:20:25.810
that something didn't ring right

355
00:20:25.845 --> 00:20:27.640
about the Apollo 1 spacecraft

356
00:20:27.674 --> 00:20:31.368
and that if he saw
any signs of trouble

357
00:20:31.402 --> 00:20:33.715
that he should get out quickly.

358
00:20:35.061 --> 00:20:36.683
- [Narrator] After this
disastrous fire

359
00:20:36.718 --> 00:20:38.789
during the Apollo 1 test.

360
00:20:38.823 --> 00:20:41.930
NASA decided to run many
successive test flights

361
00:20:41.964 --> 00:20:43.483
that were unmanned.

362
00:20:43.518 --> 00:20:46.106
Mike Bara famously
co-authored the book

363
00:20:46.141 --> 00:20:48.937
"Dark Mission: The Secret
History of NASA"

364
00:20:48.971 --> 00:20:51.629
in which he speculates
with photo evidence

365
00:20:51.664 --> 00:20:55.254
that NASA has been covering
up anomalies on the Moon.

366
00:20:55.288 --> 00:20:57.152
- The other possibility is that

367
00:20:57.186 --> 00:20:59.637
we have had far more
advanced technology

368
00:20:59.672 --> 00:21:02.847
than we will acknowledge
for the last 60. 70 years.

369
00:21:02.882 --> 00:21:06.230
And it's some of our
guys having a little fun

370
00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:08.025
with the spam in a can.

371
00:21:08.059 --> 00:21:11.097
Dudes that are stuck
in the Apollo program.

372
00:21:11.131 --> 00:21:13.237
That's what Gus Grissom
once referred to Apollo as

373
00:21:13.272 --> 00:21:15.929
is we're spam in a can.
he was overheard to say.

374
00:21:15.964 --> 00:21:17.552
and they've been to the
Moon already.

375
00:21:17.586 --> 00:21:18.587
they've been to Mars already.

376
00:21:18.622 --> 00:21:20.934
They got technology we
can't even dream of here

377
00:21:20.969 --> 00:21:24.455
and they're sticking us up here
in these rickety old rockets

378
00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:25.456
and risking our lives.

379
00:21:25.491 --> 00:21:27.562
And of course. he ended
up losing his life

380
00:21:27.596 --> 00:21:30.185
and a lot of people have a
lot of suspicions about that.

381
00:21:30.219 --> 00:21:33.533
that he was such a vocal
advocate for the fact

382
00:21:33.568 --> 00:21:35.570
that they had better
technology than they were using

383
00:21:35.604 --> 00:21:36.433
to go to the Moon

384
00:21:36.467 --> 00:21:38.814
and it really made him angry

385
00:21:38.849 --> 00:21:40.437
and could have made
him a target.

386
00:21:44.924 --> 00:21:47.892
- [Narrator] November
9th. 1967 was the day

387
00:21:47.927 --> 00:21:51.620
in which the Saturn 5 launch
vehicle was first tested.

388
00:21:51.655 --> 00:21:54.934
This was the rocket that would
send astronauts to the Moon.

389
00:21:56.418 --> 00:21:59.110
[ominous music]

390
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:06.463
On April 4th. 1968. this
unmanned flight

391
00:22:06.497 --> 00:22:09.189
tested the Saturn 5's ability
to perform

392
00:22:09.224 --> 00:22:13.780
a trans lunar injection
using 80% of the payload.

393
00:22:13.815 --> 00:22:17.405
which the later manned
mission would perform again.

394
00:22:17.439 --> 00:22:21.823
Unfortunately. the phenomenon
known as the Pogo Effect

395
00:22:21.857 --> 00:22:25.516
damaged the two Rocketdyne
engines on the second stage

396
00:22:25.551 --> 00:22:28.381
when the internal fuel
lines ruptured.

397
00:22:28.416 --> 00:22:32.558
The Rocketdyne J2 engine
on the S4B third stage

398
00:22:32.592 --> 00:22:36.424
also failed to restart
trans lunar injection.

399
00:22:36.458 --> 00:22:40.531
So the correct trans lunar
velocity could not be achieved.

400
00:22:40.566 --> 00:22:44.224
Nevertheless. NASA considered
the Saturn 5

401
00:22:44.259 --> 00:22:45.881
ready to receive its first crew.

402
00:22:52.578 --> 00:22:54.925
October 11th. 1968. Apollo 7

403
00:22:56.375 --> 00:23:00.171
was the first manned space
flight of the Apollo program.

Donn Eisele.
Commander Walter M. Schirra

405
00:23:05.245 --> 00:23:10.250
and Walter Cunningham's crew
spend almost 11 days in space

406
00:23:10.561 --> 00:23:12.977
testing a command module
spacecraft

407
00:23:13.944 --> 00:23:15.428
designed to orbit the Earth

408
00:23:15.463 --> 00:23:19.398
and safely bring humans to
the Moon and back again.

409
00:23:23.574 --> 00:23:27.371
The mission objective was to
demonstrate crew performance

410
00:23:27.406 --> 00:23:29.269
with the command service module.

411
00:23:33.204 --> 00:23:34.620
- [Reporter] Apollo 7
was also a go

412
00:23:34.654 --> 00:23:36.449
for an exhaustive series
of tests

413
00:23:36.484 --> 00:23:38.451
of its worthiness in space.

414
00:23:38.486 --> 00:23:40.384
One of the first things
which had to be learned

415
00:23:40.419 --> 00:23:43.111
was whether the astronauts
could control the spacecraft

416
00:23:43.145 --> 00:23:45.872
combined with the
S4B Saturn stage.

417
00:23:46.839 --> 00:23:48.703
A very similar thing would
have to be done

418
00:23:48.737 --> 00:23:51.153
during the early phases
of a lunar mission.

419
00:23:51.188 --> 00:23:53.086
The answer was not
long in coming.

420
00:23:54.467 --> 00:23:55.951
- [Astronaut] S4B test complete.

421
00:23:55.986 --> 00:23:56.780
- [Astronaut] Beautiful.

422
00:23:56.814 --> 00:23:57.677
- [Astronaut] It was outstanding

423
00:23:57.712 --> 00:24:00.128
- [Astronaut] Real. fine and ups

424
00:24:00.162 --> 00:24:01.474
- [Reporter] Next.
the spacecraft

425
00:24:01.509 --> 00:24:03.994
and S4B stage were separated.

426
00:24:04.028 --> 00:24:06.065
The question now was
whether the astronauts

427
00:24:06.099 --> 00:24:07.860
could turn their
spacecraft around

428
00:24:07.894 --> 00:24:09.655
and control it to the
degree required

429
00:24:09.689 --> 00:24:12.830
for future physical linkups
with equipment in space.

430
00:24:12.865 --> 00:24:15.626
For this too would have to
be done in the lunar flight.

431
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:19.837
And again. the answer was yes.

432
00:24:20.804 --> 00:24:23.013
- [Astronaut] A little
flight is like Germany.

433
00:24:23.047 --> 00:24:24.463
- [Reporter] Something
that will not be seen

434
00:24:24.497 --> 00:24:26.188
in the lunar flight or
in any other

435
00:24:26.223 --> 00:24:27.673
forthcoming Apollo mission

436
00:24:27.707 --> 00:24:30.848
were the panels at the
top of the S4B stage.

437
00:24:30.883 --> 00:24:32.781
They will simply be
jettisoned in the future.

438
00:24:32.816 --> 00:24:34.714
But they drew comment
in Apollo 7.

439
00:24:35.819 --> 00:24:37.199
- [Astronaut] And the slot panel

440
00:24:37.234 --> 00:24:40.996
at the top left and bottom
opened.

441
00:24:41.031 --> 00:24:43.067
And I would about a
45 degree angle

442
00:24:43.102 --> 00:24:44.483
and the slot panel on the right.

443
00:24:44.517 --> 00:24:48.866
just opened though maybe 30
degrees at the very best.

444
00:24:49.902 --> 00:24:51.386
- [Control] All right. Roger.

445
00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:54.320
looks like you're looking at
a four jawed angry alligator.

446

and the astronaut crew
interactions were successful.

449

This was the first mission
to use the Apollo flight suit

450
00:25:07.333 --> 00:25:08.990
and to successfully complete

451
00:25:09.024 --> 00:25:11.717

In Apollo 7. through the
medium of television.

456
00:25:22.935 --> 00:25:25.834
we could actually see them
in space for the first time

457
00:25:25.869 --> 00:25:27.077
and become better acquainted

458
00:25:27.111 --> 00:25:29.286
with weightless life aboard
a spacecraft.

and the first mission to bring
humans to the Moon's orbit.

472
00:26:43.671 --> 00:26:46.881
They were the first humans
to leave low Earth orbit.

The first to see the
entire Earth.

474

the first to see the
dark side of the Moon

approximately halfway between
the Moon and the Earth.

We've been 31 hours. about
20 minutes into the flight.

Many of 'em look like.
especially the round ones.

521
00:29:40.433 --> 00:29:44.403
look like hit by meteorites
or projectiles of some sort.

522
00:29:48.683 --> 00:29:50.133
- [Controller] A level
we have a picture.

523
00:29:50.167 --> 00:29:52.998
We see the Earth right in the
center of the screen over.

524
00:29:53.032 --> 00:29:55.379
- [Narrator] During
these TV transmissions.

525
00:29:55.414 --> 00:29:58.486
the astronauts also
provided a verbal commentary

526
00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.627
to accompany the footage
being broadcast.

527
00:30:01.661 --> 00:30:05.286
Contrary to popular
belief. these broadcasts

528
00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:09.600
were not extemporaneous or
improvised performances.

529
00:30:09.635 --> 00:30:12.914
Rather. both the footage
and dialogue

530
00:30:12.949 --> 00:30:15.814
were entirely scripted
out prior to the flight.

531
00:30:24.374 --> 00:30:27.135
The Apollo cover story
was specifically designed

532
00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:31.277
to allow those missions to be
conducted in the public eye.

533
00:30:31.312 --> 00:30:35.212
while at the same time
actively concealing the fact

534
00:30:35.247 --> 00:30:38.284
that evidence of intelligent
extraterrestrial life

535
00:30:38.319 --> 00:30:41.149
might have been discovered
in space and on the Moon.

536
00:30:42.323 --> 00:30:46.189
The scripting protocols followed
during the Apollo program

537
00:30:46.223 --> 00:30:48.570
were for the most part
highly effective

538
00:30:48.605 --> 00:30:50.952
at ensuring the astronauts
did not divulge

539
00:30:50.987 --> 00:30:54.231
any sensitive information
while they communicated

540
00:30:54.266 --> 00:30:57.372
over the public radio
channel with Houston.

541
00:30:57.407 --> 00:30:59.892
However. when the astronauts
were not

542
00:30:59.927 --> 00:31:02.791
in radio contact with
Mission Control.

543
00:31:02.826 --> 00:31:05.587
they did on occasion make
some unscripted

544
00:31:05.622 --> 00:31:08.418
and rather candid comments
to each other

545
00:31:08.452 --> 00:31:11.731
about what they were observing
outside their spacecraft.

546
00:31:13.354 --> 00:31:15.701
These comments were
captured by a device

547
00:31:15.735 --> 00:31:19.532
mounted inside the Apollo
command and service module

548
00:31:19.567 --> 00:31:21.741
that was known as the
data storage

549
00:31:21.776 --> 00:31:24.986
equipment recorder or DSE.

550
00:31:25.021 --> 00:31:28.921
The Apollo DSE was essentially
a black box cockpit

551
00:31:28.956 --> 00:31:31.855
voice and telemetry
recording system.

552
00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:36.101
In addition to recording a
variety of spacecraft parameters

553
00:31:36.135 --> 00:31:39.518
the DSE's 14 track tape
also recorded

554
00:31:39.552 --> 00:31:43.004
many internal crew
conversations that took place

555
00:31:43.039 --> 00:31:44.316
when the astronauts were not

556
00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:46.663
communicating with
Mission Control.

557
00:31:48.044 --> 00:31:50.218
Although it is presumed
that the recordings

558
00:31:50.253 --> 00:31:52.220
were destroyed or lost.

559
00:31:52.255 --> 00:31:54.533
the transcriptions were
made at NASA

560
00:31:55.741 --> 00:31:59.331
by the woman shown in
this image and others.

561
00:31:59.365 --> 00:32:02.023
And although they were
originally classified.

562
00:32:02.058 --> 00:32:05.924
those transcripts can be found
today in the NASA archives.

563
00:32:07.408 --> 00:32:10.514
Many of the comments captured
by the DSE

564
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:12.758
were made when the spacecraft
was behind

565
00:32:12.792 --> 00:32:14.415
the far side of the Moon

566
00:32:14.449 --> 00:32:16.900
with the astronauts
describing various sites

567
00:32:16.935 --> 00:32:18.488
not visible from Earth.

580
00:34:00.555 --> 00:34:01.763
- What's very interesting about

581
00:34:01.798 --> 00:34:05.802
the Apollo 8 manned
mission to the Moon is that

582
00:34:05.836 --> 00:34:08.667
we would hear about all
of these things

583
00:34:08.701 --> 00:34:13.258
that astronauts and UFO
researchers would repeat

584
00:34:13.292 --> 00:34:16.744
being demonstrated in the
communications.

585
00:34:16.778 --> 00:34:18.573
photos and footage

586
00:34:18.608 --> 00:34:21.852
throughout many other
Apollo manned missions.

587
00:34:21.887 --> 00:34:26.236
That is structures on
the far side of the Moon.

588
00:34:26.271 --> 00:34:29.412
UFOs. an anomalous activity
in space.

589
00:34:29.446 --> 00:34:33.623
as well as this eerie
music or strange sounds

590
00:34:33.657 --> 00:34:36.522
that the astronauts only heard

591
00:34:36.557 --> 00:34:38.697
when they were on the
far side of the Moon.

592
00:34:39.939 --> 00:34:41.113
And what's interesting is that

593
00:34:41.148 --> 00:34:43.564
we will hear a more
detailed account

594
00:34:43.598 --> 00:34:47.913
and more evidence of this
strange music or sounds

595
00:34:47.947 --> 00:34:49.742
on the far side of the Moon

596
00:34:49.777 --> 00:34:52.331
in the later Apollo 10
manned mission.

597
00:34:53.436 --> 00:34:58.096
And one has to wonder.
is this sound

598
00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:01.754
emanating from a base or
maybe these structures

599
00:35:01.789 --> 00:35:05.620
that were observed on the
far side of the lunar surface

600
00:35:05.655 --> 00:35:08.968
or was the sound actually
coming from space?

601
00:35:09.003 --> 00:35:13.145
And does the Moon operate
as some kind of insulator

602
00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:17.391
to feedback coming from space?

603
00:35:17.425 --> 00:35:20.773
- [Narrator] March 3rd. 1969.
Apollo 9

604
00:35:20.808 --> 00:35:24.294
was the third man's space
mission in the Apollo program

605
00:35:24.329 --> 00:35:27.366
and the first flight with
the Apollo lunar module.

606
00:35:27.401 --> 00:35:30.507
The crew spent 10 days in
low Earth orbit

607
00:35:30.542 --> 00:35:33.510
testing several critical
aspects of landing on the Moon.

608
00:35:33.545 --> 00:35:35.547
including lunar module engines.

609
00:35:35.581 --> 00:35:39.309
spacesuit life support
systems. navigation systems.

610
00:35:39.344 --> 00:35:40.862
and docking maneuvers.

611
00:35:40.897 --> 00:35:43.831
- We were that first crew
that was gonna get a chance

612
00:35:43.865 --> 00:35:47.352
to fly this vehicle and
test this vehicle

613
00:35:47.386 --> 00:35:50.941
that was going to take
human beings to the Moon.

614
00:35:50.976 --> 00:35:55.567
We were very. very aware
of the time pressure

615
00:35:55.601 --> 00:35:57.810
and everything has to go right

616
00:35:57.845 --> 00:36:00.606
if we're for sure gonna
meet Kennedy's goal

617
00:36:00.641 --> 00:36:04.886
of getting to the Moon
in that decade and back.

618
00:36:04.921 --> 00:36:08.200
We tested every possible
thing that could be tested.

619
00:36:08.235 --> 00:36:12.480
The mission was completely
dedicated to testing the systems

620
00:36:12.515 --> 00:36:15.207
the engines and the
guidance and navigation.

621
00:36:15.242 --> 00:36:18.245
all kinds of things that
we could do in Earth orbit.

622
00:36:18.279 --> 00:36:21.248
- Really very difficult to get

623
00:36:21.282 --> 00:36:23.560
the coordinate system
in your head.

624
00:36:23.595 --> 00:36:27.461
Normally. we docked looking
out this way

625
00:36:27.495 --> 00:36:30.118
and for the dock we went
to Lunar module

626
00:36:30.153 --> 00:36:32.707
we had to look out this way.

627
00:36:32.742 --> 00:36:37.781
So. the control system
didn't operate

628
00:36:37.816 --> 00:36:39.127
the way it normally would.

629
00:36:40.957 --> 00:36:43.546
- [Astronaut] How does that
support car handle. Jim?

630
00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:44.581
- [Jim Lovell] Pretty nice.

631
00:36:44.616 --> 00:36:46.618
- [Narrator] This was
the first manned flight

632
00:36:46.652 --> 00:36:47.895
of a lunar module.

633
00:36:47.929 --> 00:36:50.829
the first docking and extraction
with the lunar module.

634
00:36:50.863 --> 00:36:53.659
the first completion
of a two-man spacewalk

635
00:36:53.694 --> 00:36:57.076
and the second docking
of a two-man spacecraft.

636
00:36:57.111 --> 00:36:58.285
- [Commander McDivitt]
We depressurized

637
00:36:58.319 --> 00:37:01.909
both the lunar module
and the command module

638
00:37:01.943 --> 00:37:03.945
and Rusty was going to get out

639
00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:07.846
and transfer over to the
command module.

640
00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:12.126
And we were doing that to
see that it could be done.

[ominous music continues]

643
00:37:31.076 --> 00:37:34.735
- [Narrator] Two telecasts were
made to Earth from Apollo 9.

644
00:37:34.769 --> 00:37:38.601
The first. on March 5th. lasted
for almost seven minutes.

645
00:37:38.635 --> 00:37:40.913
The second telecast on the
following day

646
00:37:40.948 --> 00:37:42.915
lasted for about 13 minutes

647
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:46.298
and only showed interior
views of the lunar module.

648
00:37:46.333 --> 00:37:49.612
Photographs taken as part of
the multi-spectral terrain

649

were successful.

650
00:37:54.617 --> 00:37:56.274

Now. Dave wanted to get it.

651
00:37:56.308 --> 00:37:57.171
get out of the spacecraft too.

652
00:37:58.448 --> 00:38:01.693
So we. part of the mission was
for him to open up the hatch.

653
00:38:01.727 --> 00:38:04.730
So. we were all out there
in the vacuum.

00:39:11.487 --> 00:39:15.283
the Apollo 10 mission was
the fourth manned mission

You can tell the world
that we have arrived.

681
00:39:26.674 --> 00:39:29.781
- [Narrator] This mission
was a successful synthesis

682

of the previous two
completed missions.

683
00:39:32.439 --> 00:39:34.164
It resulted in the lunar module

684
00:39:34.199 --> 00:39:37.202
being placed for the
first time in lunar orbit.

I wanted to honor the people
that had worked so hard.

687
00:39:46.694 --> 00:39:48.731
So we called it Snoopy.

688
00:39:48.765 --> 00:39:51.181
but you needed two names
so naturally

689
00:39:51.216 --> 00:39:53.045
the other one was Charlie Brown.

00:40:02.089 --> 00:40:04.263
in an elliptical lunar orbit

695
00:40:04.298 --> 00:40:07.853
about 14 kilometers
above the lunar surface.

696
00:40:07.888 --> 00:40:09.855
- You're amazed at what you see.

697
00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:11.478
The one thing that always
amazed me

698
00:40:11.512 --> 00:40:12.996
were the size of the boulders.

699
00:40:13.031 --> 00:40:17.104
There were these gigantic
craters down on the bottom

700
00:40:17.138 --> 00:40:19.451
would be boulder and up on
the rim would be boulders.

701
00:40:19.969 --> 00:40:22.937
- [Narrator] During the second
and final return to the Moon.

702
00:40:22.972 --> 00:40:25.768
the lunar module lost control.

703
00:40:25.802 --> 00:40:27.942
which was regained shortly
thereafter

704
00:40:27.977 --> 00:40:29.910
by its pilot. Thomas Stafford.

705
00:40:29.944 --> 00:40:30.980
- [Thomas Stafford] Yeah. okay.

706
00:40:31.014 --> 00:40:33.707
Something went wild
there and we're all set.

707
00:40:33.741 --> 00:40:34.570
We didn't lock it.

708
00:40:34.604 --> 00:40:36.088
We're going ahead to
the audible.

709
00:40:36.123 --> 00:40:38.781
- [Controller] Charlie Brown
not Houston a guy saving it.

710
00:40:38.815 --> 00:40:41.473
They had a wild gyration though.

711
00:40:41.508 --> 00:40:43.061
but they got it under control.

712
00:40:43.095 --> 00:40:45.270
- One thing people always ask.

713
00:40:45.304 --> 00:40:47.652
were you frightened.
were you scared?

714
00:40:47.686 --> 00:40:49.343
The answer is no.

715
00:40:49.377 --> 00:40:52.967
We were fighter pilots.
test pilots.

716
00:40:53.002 --> 00:40:54.244
So we knew what risk were.

717
00:40:54.279 --> 00:40:56.937
You did everything you
could to mitigate the risk.

718
00:40:56.971 --> 00:40:58.801
but there was a risk.

719
00:40:58.835 --> 00:41:00.941
So. we understood that.

720
00:41:00.975 --> 00:41:03.046
- [Narrator] After
completing this maneuver.

721
00:41:03.081 --> 00:41:05.463
the lunar module was
abandoned and launched

722
00:41:05.497 --> 00:41:07.913
into orbit around the Sun.

723
00:41:07.948 --> 00:41:11.848
As a final result. the
mission was a success.

724
00:41:11.883 --> 00:41:14.506
Separation and docking
tests in the lunar orbit

725
00:41:14.541 --> 00:41:15.887
between the command module

726
00:41:15.921 --> 00:41:18.959
and the lunar module
were all successful.

727
00:41:18.993 --> 00:41:21.064
The lunar module descended
to an altitude

728
00:41:21.099 --> 00:41:25.897
of approximately 15 kilometers
above the lunar surface.

729
00:41:25.931 --> 00:41:29.832
- Well. we had a series of
debriefings to them about.

730
00:41:29.866 --> 00:41:32.593
because we had all the
procedures worked out.

731
00:41:32.628 --> 00:41:35.044
Actually. I went to Neil
says. buddy. here you are.

732
00:41:35.078 --> 00:41:36.873
Here's all the techniques.

733
00:41:36.908 --> 00:41:40.843
all the procedures down
to the last 50.000 feet.

734
00:41:40.877 --> 00:41:43.915
And you take it there hard
decent on the surface.

735
00:41:43.949 --> 00:41:46.952
50.000 feet up. it's all done.

736
00:41:46.987 --> 00:41:49.852
So they just followed all
the procedures we had.

737
00:41:49.886 --> 00:41:52.544
[ominous music]

738
00:41:55.305 --> 00:41:57.273
We were using has some
live cameras

739
00:41:57.307 --> 00:41:59.586
to get the highest resolution.

740
00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:02.554
Well. then and radar was going.

741
00:42:02.589 --> 00:42:06.316
So radar map. photo
maps and visually maps.

742
00:42:06.351 --> 00:42:08.077
- But I'll tell you one
thing. when we went over.

743
00:42:08.111 --> 00:42:10.251
we made two passes over
the landing site

744
00:42:10.286 --> 00:42:12.702
and I tell you what.

745
00:42:13.945 --> 00:42:16.775
I think I said things that
boy we are down among.

746
00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:18.881
I felt like I had to pick
up my feet

747
00:42:18.915 --> 00:42:20.676
to keep from dragging
on top of the mountains.

748
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:23.955
I mean we were close and
we're going over those hills

749
00:42:23.989 --> 00:42:25.612
at 3.000 miles an hour.

750
00:42:25.646 --> 00:42:28.166
So. you can just imagine
what that was like.

751
00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:32.066
And it was one of those
quick touch and goes.

752
00:42:32.101 --> 00:42:35.553
We didn't have a chance to put
our tail hook down to stay.

753
00:42:37.002 --> 00:42:42.007
And that would've been the
big part of the challenge.

754
00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.320
Nonetheless. we were
only the second flight

755
00:42:44.354 --> 00:42:45.183
to go to the Moon.

756
00:42:45.217 --> 00:42:47.219
the first to take the
lunar module.

757
00:42:47.254 --> 00:42:49.567
And it was the right decision
to be made

758
00:42:49.601 --> 00:42:50.775
to get everything done.

759
00:42:50.809 --> 00:42:55.469
And we found some problems
that had we attempted to land

760
00:42:55.503 --> 00:42:56.746
might have kept us from landing

761
00:42:56.781 --> 00:42:59.715
and then paved a way for Apollo

762
00:42:59.749 --> 00:43:01.613
to go hand and successfully land

763
00:43:01.648 --> 00:43:04.236
So. it was the right
decision at the right time.

764
00:43:04.271 --> 00:43:05.755
- I have. I've looked
at a lot of transcripts.

765
00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:08.482
The Apollo lunar surface
journal was great for that.

766
00:43:08.516 --> 00:43:10.518
On Apollo 10. which is
where we have

767
00:43:10.553 --> 00:43:13.280
the images of Sinus Medii.
it's really fascinating.

768
00:43:13.314 --> 00:43:15.972
because Gene Cernan
was on that mission

769
00:43:16.007 --> 00:43:17.525
as well as Apollo 17.

770
00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:20.598
And they're at 50.000 feet

771
00:43:20.632 --> 00:43:24.222
and he says. wow. we are
really down among them now.

772
00:43:24.256 --> 00:43:27.190
I'm like there's nothing
at 50.000 feet.

773
00:43:27.225 --> 00:43:28.675
If the Moon is what
they tell us is.

774
00:43:28.709 --> 00:43:31.712
unless it's this
artificial glass structure.

775
00:43:31.747 --> 00:43:33.265
at 50.000 feet.

776
00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:34.577
- [Interviewer] If they're
scared of hitting it.

777
00:43:34.612 --> 00:43:39.202
- Yeah. meaning he's in
amongst towering stuff.

778
00:43:39.237 --> 00:43:40.272
Well. it isn't the mountains.

779
00:43:40.307 --> 00:43:41.964
'cause the mountains
aren't that high for sure.

780
00:43:41.998 --> 00:43:44.311
- [Narrator] In addition to
recording telemetry related

781
00:43:44.345 --> 00:43:47.417
to the performance of the
lunar module spacecraft itself

782
00:43:47.452 --> 00:43:50.213
the DSEA also made
audio recordings

783
00:43:50.248 --> 00:43:52.975
of any crew conversation
throughout the mission.

784
00:43:53.009 --> 00:43:54.632
- [Astronaut] Apollo can
Houston. two minutes.

785
00:43:54.666 --> 00:43:59.637
the LOS. everybody here
says God speed.

786
00:44:00.672 --> 00:44:01.846
- [Controller] Okay.
and we'll see you right

787
00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:03.261
on the other side in orbit.

788
00:44:05.953 --> 00:44:07.058
- [Astronaut] Okay. this
has got be

789
00:44:07.092 --> 00:44:09.716
the greatest site ever here.

790
00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:12.650
- [Astronaut] Try to
stand up here.

791
00:44:13.651 --> 00:44:16.308

- [Reporter] Noises reportedly
were heard in May. 1969

801
00:45:43.085 --> 00:45:46.605
by the Apollo 10 astronauts
as they circled the Moon.

802
00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:48.884
The sounds which lasted
about an hour

803
00:45:48.918 --> 00:45:52.680
were recorded and transmitted
to Mission Control in Houston.

804
00:45:53.509 --> 00:45:56.029
- The music even sounds
outer space doesn't it?

805
00:45:56.063 --> 00:45:56.857
You hear that?

806
00:45:56.892 --> 00:45:57.755
That whistling sound?

807
00:45:58.652 --> 00:45:59.584
Whoooooooo.

808
00:46:09.628 --> 00:46:10.629
- [Controller] We are
getting data.

809
00:46:10.664 --> 00:46:12.770
We don't have any voice
communication yet.

810
00:46:13.909 --> 00:46:15.703
- [Astronaut] Roger Houston.
Apollo 10.

811
00:46:15.738 --> 00:46:18.983
You can tell the world
that we have arrived.

812
00:46:19.017 --> 00:46:20.363
- [Controller] Roger 10.
it's good to hear from you.

813
00:46:20.398 --> 00:46:22.780
- [Gene Cernan] You
wouldn't believe this thing.

814
00:46:25.506 --> 00:46:27.094
- [Astronaut] Roger 10.
we're still

815
00:46:27.129 --> 00:46:29.303
having problems popping up.

816
00:46:29.338 --> 00:46:31.858
Oh. we'd like you to go to
white beam for 30 seconds

817
00:46:31.892 --> 00:46:33.480
and then back to narrow over.

818
00:46:33.514 --> 00:46:35.171
- [Gene Cernan] No. I can
see it with the naked eye

819
00:46:35.206 --> 00:46:37.104
and I put the binocular on it

820
00:46:37.139 --> 00:46:38.968
and I can it spinning around

821
00:46:39.003 --> 00:46:42.040
and I wouldn't bet my
life on it being the S4B

822
00:46:42.075 --> 00:46:45.492
but it's sure gotta be
something like it.

823
00:46:47.770 --> 00:46:50.566
- [Reporter] That was Gene
Cernan reporting that sighting.

824
00:46:56.675 --> 00:46:58.781
- [Gene Cernan] You know.
it's a beautiful sight.

825
00:46:58.816 --> 00:47:00.921
We're sitting here. it's
almost like science fiction.

826
00:47:00.956 --> 00:47:02.612
Looking back at it. Bruce.

827
00:47:07.583 --> 00:47:10.897
This is the peacock of
Apollo 10. Roger.

828
00:47:12.726 --> 00:47:15.763
And we'd like to say hello
from the five of us if we may.

829
00:47:16.764 --> 00:47:17.593
Roger.

830
00:47:18.766 --> 00:47:21.424
[ominous music]

831
00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:35.197
Charlie this is it.

832
00:47:36.163 --> 00:47:37.509
It's so hard to describe.

833
00:47:37.544 --> 00:47:39.201
You can go right up.

834
00:47:41.444 --> 00:47:42.135
Uh.

835
00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:43.757
It is incredible.

836
00:47:50.005 --> 00:47:51.316
- [Controller] Okay. this has
got to be

837
00:47:51.351 --> 00:47:52.559
the greatest sight ever.

838
00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:55.079
- [Astronaut] You gotta see
it up here.

839
00:48:06.366 --> 00:48:10.749
The land masses don't seem
to stand out quite as clearly

840
00:48:10.784 --> 00:48:12.682
today as they did yesterday.

841
00:48:12.717 --> 00:48:15.375
[ominous music]

842
00:48:20.311 --> 00:48:21.968
- [Controller]
How's the view 10?

843
00:48:24.384 --> 00:48:26.317
- [Astronaut] We have our
student geologist here

844
00:48:26.351 --> 00:48:29.389
overlook at the surface
that they reported admitted.

845
00:48:30.252 --> 00:48:32.081
- [Controller] Roger.
standing by over.

846
00:48:32.116 --> 00:48:33.703
- [Astronaut] Okay. we're just
passing from the highlands

847
00:48:33.738 --> 00:48:38.708
over into the Mari area and
you can pass on to Jack.

848
00:48:38.743 --> 00:48:41.159
We caught a couple of real
pretty little volcanoes.

849
00:48:41.194 --> 00:48:42.264
there's no doubt about 'em.

850
00:48:42.298 --> 00:48:45.784
And we got a couple of
good high resolution photos

851
00:48:45.819 --> 00:48:49.961
and it still looks kind of
brownish crater to us here over.

852
00:48:51.549 --> 00:48:53.275
- [Controller] Roger.
we copy. we hear that.

853
00:48:53.309 --> 00:48:56.519
- [Astronaut] There was place
back there where there's that.

854
00:48:56.554 --> 00:48:59.315
There was one volcano or
whatever it was

855
00:49:00.454 --> 00:49:02.077
that it was all white
on the outside.

856
00:49:02.111 --> 00:49:04.286
but definitely black
around the top of it.

857
00:49:06.771 --> 00:49:07.841
- [Controller] Roger.

858
00:49:11.810 --> 00:49:13.157
Charlie. it might sound corny.

859
00:49:13.191 --> 00:49:15.228
but the view is really
out of this world.

860
00:49:19.128 --> 00:49:20.612
We had a couple of comments.

861
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:23.167
The back row that
I won't repeat.

862
00:49:27.067 --> 00:49:30.001

two minutes to LOS.

863
00:49:30.968 --> 00:49:32.555
Everybody here says God speed.

864
00:49:35.489 --> 00:49:36.870
- [Astronaut] Okay.
And we'll see you

865
00:49:36.904 --> 00:49:38.596
on the other side in orbit.

866
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:41.702
- [Controller] Oh Roger.
76 22 55.

867
00:49:57.511 --> 00:49:59.720
- Many skeptics and debunkers

868
00:49:59.755 --> 00:50:02.585
will remark on the fact that

869
00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:06.796
mainstream media was not
reporting on UFOs. anomalies

870
00:50:06.831 --> 00:50:10.455
and structures being
witnessed by astronauts

871
00:50:10.490 --> 00:50:12.388
during the Apollo
manned missions.

872
00:50:12.423 --> 00:50:15.426
And the simple reason why
mainstream media

873
00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:19.430
wasn't exposed to this back
in the 1960s and seventies

874
00:50:19.464 --> 00:50:22.226
during the Apollo missions
is because

875
00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:25.746
that information was
deeply classified.

876
00:50:25.781 --> 00:50:30.441
In fact. the DSEA tapes
weren't actually declassified

877
00:50:30.475 --> 00:50:33.892
till 12 years after these
Apollo manned missions.

878
00:50:34.962 --> 00:50:39.933
And additionally. we didn't
have photography and film

879
00:50:40.934 --> 00:50:45.007
fully examined by many
of the UFO researchers

880
00:50:45.042 --> 00:50:48.321
and independent researchers
like Luna Cognita

881
00:50:48.355 --> 00:50:50.840
until many years after.

882
00:50:50.875 --> 00:50:52.049
- How can they keep the secret?

883
00:50:52.083 --> 00:50:55.431
Some of these SETI people like
really just make me laugh.

884
00:50:55.466 --> 00:50:58.055
I've heard some pretty
stupid comments

885
00:50:58.089 --> 00:50:59.711
coming out of these mouths.

886
00:50:59.746 --> 00:51:02.611
Like this assumption
that. oh yeah. the press.

887
00:51:02.645 --> 00:51:05.545
the media wants this scoop.

888
00:51:05.579 --> 00:51:08.548
Well. the media doesn't
want that scoop.

889
00:51:08.582 --> 00:51:10.343
because they're not
authorized to give it

890
00:51:10.377 --> 00:51:11.792
and they won't give it.

891
00:51:11.827 --> 00:51:13.311
'cause the intelligence
community will tell them

892
00:51:13.346 --> 00:51:14.416
what they can give.

893
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:18.903
And NASA doesn't
want this scoop.

894
00:51:20.007 --> 00:51:22.458
And I don't care what
these SETI people

895
00:51:22.493 --> 00:51:25.979
like to tell the public
they don't want that scoop.

896
00:51:26.013 --> 00:51:27.877
- So another case like this.
which is really interesting.

897
00:51:27.912 --> 00:51:31.122
is the case of NASA frame
AS10-32-4822.

898
00:51:33.814 --> 00:51:36.541
This is a photograph or
a series of photographs

899
00:51:36.576 --> 00:51:39.613
that was taken over the
lunar surface

900
00:51:39.648 --> 00:51:42.133
right in the middle Sinus
Medii the sea in the middle.

901
00:51:42.168 --> 00:51:45.930
The sea in the middle where
the Apollo 10 spacecraft

902
00:51:45.964 --> 00:51:49.175
was flying by and took
photographs of this area.

903
00:51:49.209 --> 00:51:51.280
This is dead center on
the lunar disk.

904
00:51:51.315 --> 00:51:53.179
If you were to look at
the lunar disk.

905
00:51:53.213 --> 00:51:55.319
you'd see a triangular shaped
crater called you Kurt.

906
00:51:55.353 --> 00:51:58.115
And then right next to it
is the Sinus Medii area.

907
00:51:58.149 --> 00:52:03.223
It's also an area where surveyor
four disappeared in mid-air

908
00:52:03.258 --> 00:52:04.914
while descending to
a landing there

909
00:52:04.949 --> 00:52:08.401
just like a bug went
splat on a windshield.

910
00:52:08.435 --> 00:52:09.609
So this is the photograph.

911
00:52:09.643 --> 00:52:13.751
This is an original analog
image that's been scanned in

912
00:52:13.785 --> 00:52:18.790
by researchers back
in the 1990s.

913
00:52:18.997 --> 00:52:20.275
And it looks pretty
straightforward.

914
00:52:20.309 --> 00:52:23.692
This is actually AS10-32-4810.

915
00:52:23.726 --> 00:52:25.590
So it's a couple images earlier.

916
00:52:25.625 --> 00:52:27.178
It's 12 images earlier than that

917
00:52:27.213 --> 00:52:28.869
over the Sinus Medii region.

918
00:52:28.904 --> 00:52:30.733
And you notice in the
background that

919
00:52:30.768 --> 00:52:33.495
there's all this weird
sort of stuff.

920
00:52:33.529 --> 00:52:36.222
You see all this light sources.

921
00:52:36.256 --> 00:52:38.051
now that can't be stars.

922
00:52:38.085 --> 00:52:41.227
because the frame exposure
is one 250th of a second.

923
00:52:41.261 --> 00:52:42.849
If you go much longer than that.

924
00:52:42.883 --> 00:52:45.714
the whole foreground is gonna
be washed out with light.

925
00:52:45.748 --> 00:52:47.233
So it has to be really.
really rapid.

926
00:52:47.267 --> 00:52:49.787
So it can't possibly be far
distance stars

927
00:52:49.821 --> 00:52:51.996
and galaxies and planets.

928
00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:54.999
But if you enhance this image.

929
00:52:55.033 --> 00:52:57.967
if you brighten up the
background. it gets even weirder

930
00:52:58.002 --> 00:52:59.728
because this is what the
background is.

931
00:52:59.762 --> 00:53:02.696
So what you see is that
these light points

932
00:53:02.731 --> 00:53:07.011
are actually just points
of... structure

933
00:53:07.045 --> 00:53:09.945
that is in this massive
miles high...

934
00:53:11.878 --> 00:53:15.192
geometric structure above the
lunar surface over the sea

935
00:53:15.226 --> 00:53:16.434
in the middle of Sinus Medii.

936
00:53:16.469 --> 00:53:21.474
Now. if you notice. there
are these crisscrossing lines

937
00:53:21.715 --> 00:53:22.716
and people are like. oh.

938
00:53:22.751 --> 00:53:24.442
those are just scratches
on the negative.

939
00:53:24.477 --> 00:53:25.754
Well. but that doesn't
make any sense.

940
00:53:25.788 --> 00:53:28.481
because when do scratches
on the negative

941
00:53:28.515 --> 00:53:32.416
follow the curvature of
the lunar surface?

942
00:53:32.450 --> 00:53:36.799
And when do they intersect
at 90 degree angles.

943
00:53:36.834 --> 00:53:37.800
like these do.

944
00:53:38.629 --> 00:53:40.838
And again. as an engineer.
I look at this.

945
00:53:40.872 --> 00:53:41.977
I look at the spacing.

946
00:53:42.011 --> 00:53:44.704
I say this is exactly
how I would construct

947
00:53:44.738 --> 00:53:48.259
a grid-like structure over
the surface of the Moon.

948
00:53:48.294 --> 00:53:53.264
If you zoom in on it. there's
this sort of box-like shape.

949
00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:57.268
And here's spars coming this
way and spars coming that way.

950
00:53:57.303 --> 00:53:58.718
And here's one crossing.

951
00:53:58.752 --> 00:54:01.410
And these are all not scratches.

952
00:54:01.445 --> 00:54:03.309
These all have structure
to them.

953
00:54:03.343 --> 00:54:06.829
They all have. if you look at
them really. really closely.

954
00:54:06.864 --> 00:54:10.695
they all have segments. they
all have aspects to them

955
00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:12.732
that make them appear
to be engineering.

956
00:54:13.836 --> 00:54:15.976
And when you enhance
it. put a color into it.

957
00:54:16.011 --> 00:54:17.357
it looks even weirder.

958
00:54:19.808 --> 00:54:23.156
Here's another version with
a slightly darker background.

959
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:25.469
So then you get a couple
of pictures later

960
00:54:25.503 --> 00:54:29.266
and you go to AS10-32-4816.

961
00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:33.718
So four photographs later. over
the surface of Sinus Medii.

962
00:54:33.753 --> 00:54:34.995
Here you have the same
phenomenon.

963
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:36.859
You have these little
points of light.

964
00:54:36.894 --> 00:54:39.862
which should not be there
at all.

965
00:54:39.897 --> 00:54:43.659
And then when you enhance
that background. you see this.

966
00:54:45.005 --> 00:54:49.631
This looks like. I don't
know. skyscrapers on the Moon.

967
00:54:49.665 --> 00:54:50.735
The Twin Towers.

968
00:54:50.770 --> 00:54:52.392
I mean when you look
and zoom up on this

969
00:54:52.427 --> 00:54:53.945
and also notice this isn't

970
00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:56.327
some sort of like
digital artifact.

971
00:54:56.362 --> 00:54:57.949
because if it was. it would
be over the whole thing.

972
00:54:57.984 --> 00:55:01.884
Yet. there's this big hole
through which you can see

973
00:55:01.919 --> 00:55:05.302
stuff in the background.
more big towering stuff.

974
00:55:05.336 --> 00:55:07.580
And when you zoom up
on the edges of that.

975
00:55:07.614 --> 00:55:09.823
you can see just how
weird they are.

976
00:55:09.858 --> 00:55:12.930
They look like big glass
skyscrapers.

977
00:55:12.964 --> 00:55:15.001
So having found this stuff.

978
00:55:15.035 --> 00:55:17.969
Hoagland was really
interested in finding more.

979
00:55:18.004 --> 00:55:19.764
So he went and he got himself

980
00:55:19.799 --> 00:55:22.940
an old North American
photographic catalog

981
00:55:22.974 --> 00:55:24.424
from the time period.

982
00:55:24.459 --> 00:55:28.670
And as he looked at these
images. he went and he said.

983
00:55:28.704 --> 00:55:30.430
oh. well. look at some
of these other ones.

984
00:55:30.465 --> 00:55:34.814
These other catalog images
don't look like much at all.

985
00:55:34.848 --> 00:55:38.852
They look really over
underexposed. including this one

986
00:55:38.887 --> 00:55:40.440
which is completely blacked out.

987
00:55:40.475 --> 00:55:43.616
It's like they left the lens
cap on the camera or something.

988
00:55:43.650 --> 00:55:45.238
So what did he do?

989
00:55:45.272 --> 00:55:47.136
He ordered the blacked out
photograph.

990
00:55:47.171 --> 00:55:50.588
And when he got AS10-32-4822.

991
00:55:50.623 --> 00:55:53.039
again. taken just what.
six frames later.

992
00:55:54.937 --> 00:55:59.425
he got this area of Sinus Medii.

993
00:55:59.459 --> 00:56:02.876
which is about the size
of the Los Angeles Basin.

994
00:56:02.911 --> 00:56:05.051
and has been analyzed
by geologists who said.

995
00:56:05.085 --> 00:56:07.847
this is a completely
non-natural pattern.

996
00:56:07.881 --> 00:56:11.195
Again. 90 degrees.
crisscrossing streets.

997
00:56:11.229 --> 00:56:15.958
that kind of thing. as if you
were looking at Los Angeles.

998
00:56:15.993 --> 00:56:19.548
And as you zoom up on
it. it gets even weirder.

999
00:56:19.583 --> 00:56:23.276
And then there are objects
that appeared

1000
00:56:23.310 --> 00:56:24.795
that then seemed to disappear.

1001
00:56:25.658 --> 00:56:28.074
What they did is they
ordered 4822

1002
00:56:28.108 --> 00:56:29.489
once they thought they
had something.

1003
00:56:29.524 --> 00:56:33.286
They ordered 4822 from nine
different NASA archives

1004
00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:34.321
that existed at the time where

1005
00:56:34.356 --> 00:56:36.565
you could get photographic
prints.

1006
00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:40.604
Hawaii. Maryland. Washington DC.

1007
00:56:40.638 --> 00:56:45.091
And what they found is that
all nine of the versions

1008
00:56:45.125 --> 00:56:49.647
of AS10-32-4822 were different.

1009
00:56:51.131 --> 00:56:54.134
So what they realized was
that what they were looking at

1010
00:56:54.169 --> 00:56:56.689
was probably a power
winder sequence.

1011
00:56:56.723 --> 00:56:59.312
The spacecraft is moving
left to right.

1012
00:56:59.346 --> 00:57:00.796
the astronauts looking
out the window.

1013
00:57:00.831 --> 00:57:03.074
he's got a power winder
on his Hasselblad.

1014
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:04.938
He pushes down his
finger and takes

1015
00:57:04.973 --> 00:57:09.046
1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9.

1016
00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:10.979
And so. objects would appear

1017
00:57:11.013 --> 00:57:14.189
in some versions of 4822
and disappear in others.

1018
00:57:14.223 --> 00:57:16.398
Here's an example of
one of those.

1019
00:57:17.503 --> 00:57:20.471
It looks like a giant paper
clip near Los Angeles.

1020
00:57:20.506 --> 00:57:23.336
If you go back to Los
Angeles. if you go back.

1021
00:57:24.648 --> 00:57:26.857
That object should be
right here. it's not there.

1022
00:57:26.891 --> 00:57:28.755
But then the next frame.
it is there.

1023
00:57:28.790 --> 00:57:31.137
because the light changes.

1024
00:57:31.171 --> 00:57:32.379
So this is a huge antenna.

1025
00:57:32.414 --> 00:57:35.382
This tower is a couple
hundred feet tall

1026
00:57:35.417 --> 00:57:39.939
and whatever this thing is.
it's an antenna or something.

1027
00:57:39.973 --> 00:57:41.803
It does not belong on the Moon.

1028
00:57:41.837 --> 00:57:44.288
If the Moon is what NASA
tells us it is.

1029
00:57:44.322 --> 00:57:49.327
And there are other frames
through the area of 4822

1030
00:57:49.673 --> 00:57:52.089
that show weird light reflection

1031
00:57:52.123 --> 00:57:54.505
like there's lights on
down there.

1032
00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:55.782
And then there's this object.

1033
00:57:55.817 --> 00:57:58.889
which is my favorite one on
the various versions of 4822.

1034
00:57:58.923 --> 00:57:59.717
It's pretty famous.

1035
00:57:59.752 --> 00:58:01.788
It's called The Castle.

1036
00:58:01.823 --> 00:58:05.378
And it appears to be hanging
amidst all this stuff.

1037
00:58:05.412 --> 00:58:09.762
Just hanging there in space
miles above the lunar surface.

1038
00:58:09.796 --> 00:58:13.904
It has segments that clearly
look to me to be structural.

1039
00:58:13.938 --> 00:58:16.251
There's even a indication of a.

1040
00:58:16.285 --> 00:58:18.978
like a sagging line.
- [Interviewer] Scaffolding?

1041
00:58:19.012 --> 00:58:21.532
- Yeah. scaffolding or
a sagging like line

1042
00:58:21.567 --> 00:58:22.568
that it's hanging from.

1043
00:58:22.602 --> 00:58:24.293
You can see that this.
the weight of this thing

1044
00:58:24.328 --> 00:58:28.539
is pulling on this wire
that it's hanging from.

1045
00:58:28.574 --> 00:58:29.885
And it does appear in a couple

1046
00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:31.922
different versions of the frame.

1047
00:58:31.956 --> 00:58:34.165
Here's the one with the
wire and then this one

1048
00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:37.514
is obviously the next one
over and another step over

1049
00:58:37.548 --> 00:58:39.895
where the thing has not
reflected the light.

1050
00:58:39.930 --> 00:58:41.310
because now the spacecraft
has moved.

1051
00:58:41.345 --> 00:58:44.521
So. it's changed direction
just a little bit.

1052
00:58:44.555 --> 00:58:47.006
The wire disappears that
it's hanging from

1053
00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:48.214
and it's narrower.

1054
00:58:48.248 --> 00:58:51.389
See how it's narrower
than it is here.

1055
00:58:51.424 --> 00:58:52.632
- [Interviewer] It's under
exposed.

1056
00:58:52.667 --> 00:58:53.840
- Right. and basically.

1057
00:58:53.875 --> 00:58:55.877
because the light geometry
is fading.

1058
00:58:55.911 --> 00:58:58.120
the light is not now bouncing
directly into the camera

1059
00:58:58.155 --> 00:59:00.675
like it was a split second
before that.

1060
00:59:00.709 --> 00:59:01.848
because the spacecraft is moving

1061
00:59:01.883 --> 00:59:03.850
at thousands of miles an hour.

1062
00:59:03.885 --> 00:59:05.369
And again. you go up to
the edge of it

1063
00:59:05.403 --> 00:59:06.577
and you can see that
there's sort of

1064
00:59:06.612 --> 00:59:08.234
an internal geometry to it.

1065
00:59:08.268 --> 00:59:10.719
There's a lot of cells
and structures.

1066
00:59:10.754 --> 00:59:12.963
It is absolutely fascinating.

1067
00:59:12.997 --> 00:59:15.586
And they hid. they knew
what was on these.

1068
00:59:15.621 --> 00:59:19.176
because they hid all
nine of these photographs

1069
00:59:19.210 --> 00:59:20.315
under one frame number.

1070
00:59:20.349 --> 00:59:24.181
It should be 4822. 4823. 4824.

1071
00:59:24.215 --> 00:59:25.769
all the way up to 4832.

1072
00:59:25.803 --> 00:59:28.081
But it's not. it's all buried
under one frame number.

1073
00:59:28.116 --> 00:59:29.807
which they. I will remind you.

1074
00:59:29.842 --> 00:59:31.153
blacked out in the catalog.

1075
00:59:31.188 --> 00:59:32.948
'cause they didn't want
anybody to look at it.

1076
00:59:32.983 --> 00:59:35.295
But because of the
religious aspects of this.

1077
00:59:35.330 --> 00:59:39.265
the weird. strange symbolism
and stuff.

1078
00:59:39.299 --> 00:59:42.233
they couldn't just completely
erase them from history.

1079
00:59:42.268 --> 00:59:45.961
They had to give you some
access to the originals.

1080
00:59:46.997 --> 00:59:48.792
If it wasn't for Hoagland
being super clever.

1081
00:59:48.826 --> 00:59:50.656
we would never have
found this stuff.

This is the television
camera that

1087
01:00:09.744 --> 01:00:12.194
will record that historic event.

1088
01:00:13.886 --> 01:00:16.854
You'll see it live on
your home television set.

1089

I'm Stan Lebar Westinghouse
program manager

1090
01:00:21.238 --> 01:00:23.102
for Apollo television cameras.

1091
01:00:24.103 --> 01:00:26.761
The public is probably
most familiar

1092
01:00:26.795 --> 01:00:29.522
with this color television
camera

1093
01:00:29.556 --> 01:00:34.561
that was used by astronaut
Tom Stafford on Apollo 10.

1094
01:00:35.252 --> 01:00:37.150
And this is a camera that
took those

1095
01:00:37.185 --> 01:00:41.430
extraordinary color pictures
of both the Earth and the Moon.

1096
01:00:41.465 --> 01:00:44.399
Incidentally. this color
camera will be used

1097
01:00:44.433 --> 01:00:46.884
in the command module
on Apollo 11.

1098
01:00:48.092 --> 01:00:50.647
But the world attention
will be focused

1099
01:00:50.681 --> 01:00:53.304
on this small black and
white camera

1100
01:00:53.339 --> 01:00:55.444
that will be located in the lens

1101
01:00:55.479 --> 01:00:57.688
and it will record the astronaut

1102
01:00:57.723 --> 01:01:00.553
as he descends to the
lunar surface

1103
01:01:00.587 --> 01:01:03.245

[rockets blasting]

1133
01:02:45.485 --> 01:02:46.970
- [Gary Martynuik] Today. I
wanted to give you a closer look

1134
01:02:47.004 --> 01:02:50.214
at a very brief segment of
16 mm "DAC" Motion Picture

1135
01:02:50.249 --> 01:02:52.285
footage from the NASA archives

1136
01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:55.254
that was originally shot
back in July in 1969

1137
01:02:55.288 --> 01:02:57.359
during the flight of Apollo 11.

1138
01:02:57.394 --> 01:02:58.809
And the footage was taken throug

1139
01:02:58.844 --> 01:03:00.846
one of the windows of the
command service module

1140
01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:03.193
during what was called
the Trans-Lunar Coast

1141
01:03:03.227 --> 01:03:05.402
or TLC phase of the mission.

1142
01:03:05.436 --> 01:03:07.922
And this was the three-day
period when the astronauts

1143
01:03:07.956 --> 01:03:10.752
were crossing the almost
400.000 kilometer

1144
01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:13.997
cislunar void that separates
our Earth from the Moon.

1145
01:03:14.031 --> 01:03:15.170
And at some point during

1146
01:03:15.205 --> 01:03:17.586
this outbound journey
through cislunar space.

1147
01:03:17.621 --> 01:03:19.381
one of the Apollo 11 astronauts

1148
01:03:19.416 --> 01:03:20.900
did some unscheduled shooting

1149
01:03:20.935 --> 01:03:23.696
with the 16 mm "DAC"
Motion Picture Camera.

1150
01:03:23.730 --> 01:03:25.422
And in the process
managed to film

1151
01:03:25.456 --> 01:03:28.839
several unidentified objects
outside their spacecraft.

1152
01:03:28.874 --> 01:03:30.807
And to show you what I mean.

1153
01:03:37.227 --> 01:03:38.642
While this particular clip
has been

1154
01:03:38.676 --> 01:03:41.196
digitally archived by NASA.
so that when played back.

1155
01:03:41.231 --> 01:03:43.889
it appears to be about
one second in duration.

1156
01:03:43.923 --> 01:03:45.545
it is not actually showing us

1157
01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:48.134
a one second period of
time caught on film.

1158
01:03:48.169 --> 01:03:49.998
This clip we're examining
here is actually

1159
01:03:50.033 --> 01:03:52.345
time compressed stop
motion footage.

1160
01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:54.451
And in this case. the
sequence is comprised

1161
01:03:54.485 --> 01:03:58.489
of 11 individual distinct
frames of 16 millimeter film

1162
01:03:58.524 --> 01:04:01.285
that were originally exposed
at one frame per second

1163
01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:04.185
intervals over a period of 11 seconds.

1164
01:04:04.219 --> 01:04:06.532
And this type of stop
motion filming was possible.

1165
01:04:06.566 --> 01:04:09.569
because the Mauer 16 mm DAC
that was used

1166
01:04:09.604 --> 01:04:11.848
throughout the Apollo program
was in fact

1167
01:04:11.882 --> 01:04:13.919
a variable frame rate
motion picture camera

1168
01:04:13.953 --> 01:04:15.575
that was capable of shooting

1169
01:04:15.610 --> 01:04:17.957
at four different preset
exposure speeds

1170
01:04:17.992 --> 01:04:21.443
either 1. 6. 12. or 24 frames
per second.

1171
01:04:21.478 --> 01:04:24.584
And in the case of this footage.
rather than archiving it

1172
01:04:24.619 --> 01:04:27.518
at the correct one frame
per second playback speed.

1173
01:04:27.553 --> 01:04:29.831
they instead incorrectly
archived the sequence

1174
01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:33.041
as if it had been shot at 12
frames per second instead.

1175
01:04:33.076 --> 01:04:34.663
So this means that NASA actually

1176
01:04:34.698 --> 01:04:36.907
present this stop motion
sequence in such a way

1177
01:04:36.942 --> 01:04:38.736
that it is being shown
at a playback rate

1178
01:04:38.771 --> 01:04:40.428
that's 12 times faster than

1179
01:04:40.462 --> 01:04:42.602
what the frames were
actually exposed at.

1180
01:04:42.637 --> 01:04:43.914
Whatever these objects are.

1181
01:04:43.949 --> 01:04:45.743
they are clearly flying
free in space.

1182
01:04:45.778 --> 01:04:48.539
And we can say with certainty
that they are definitely

1183
01:04:48.574 --> 01:04:51.473
not any declared
satellites or known debris.

1184
01:04:51.508 --> 01:04:53.544
We don't know what they
are. where they came from.

1185
01:04:53.579 --> 01:04:55.063
how they got there.
where they're going.

1186
01:04:55.098 --> 01:04:56.202
or what they're doing there.

1187
01:04:56.237 --> 01:04:58.204
And that by definition puts them

1188
01:04:58.239 --> 01:05:00.448
into the category of being
unidentified.

1189
01:05:01.449 --> 01:05:05.832
- So if somebody's gonna
say UFOs are just our craft

1190
01:05:05.867 --> 01:05:10.251
from a very top secret
aerospace project.

1191
01:05:10.285 --> 01:05:14.945
and for example. some people
will say the Phoenix Lights.

1192
01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:18.776
that might have been what's
called a TR3B.

1193
01:05:18.811 --> 01:05:23.816
It's supposed to be this
massive black budget craft

1194
01:05:24.058 --> 01:05:29.063
that was a crew and
heavy equipment carrier

1195
01:05:30.443 --> 01:05:33.136
that would take stuff to
space in sort of

1196
01:05:33.170 --> 01:05:36.380
what people label a
secret space program.

1197
01:05:37.450 --> 01:05:38.969
What do you think about that?

1198
01:05:39.004 --> 01:05:39.832
- I don't believe it.

1199
01:05:39.866 --> 01:05:40.660
- You don't believe it?

1200
01:05:40.695 --> 01:05:42.041
- Nope. don't believe it.

1201
01:05:42.076 --> 01:05:44.078
- Would you say that
the Phoenix-

1202
01:05:44.112 --> 01:05:45.010
- I think that the
Phoenix Lights.

1203
01:05:45.044 --> 01:05:46.287
I mean that was like
two miles across

1204
01:05:46.321 --> 01:05:47.391
from the eyewitness testimony.

1205
01:05:47.426 --> 01:05:49.186
including the Governor
of Arizona.

1206
01:05:49.221 --> 01:05:52.258
And it could hover very.
very slowly.

1207
01:05:53.432 --> 01:05:55.710
And when it took off.
it took off

1208
01:05:55.744 --> 01:05:57.263
like at the speed of light.

1209
01:05:57.298 --> 01:05:58.506
I mean. it would change
its shape

1210
01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:00.542
a little bit and just gone.

1211
01:06:00.577 --> 01:06:03.166
And then you have the
telepathic aspect of it too.

1212
01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.064
from the witnesses that
I spoke to.

1213
01:06:05.099 --> 01:06:07.618
So. I'm not gonna sit there
and say that

1214
01:06:07.653 --> 01:06:09.206
I definitively can make
a statement

1215
01:06:09.241 --> 01:06:12.002
that there's no such thing
as a secret space program.

1216
01:06:12.037 --> 01:06:13.590
I just haven't seen the
evidence for it

1217
01:06:13.624 --> 01:06:16.006
and I haven't heard the
test testimony for it.

1218
01:06:16.041 --> 01:06:22.806
And I'm highly dubious.
even though here I am

1219
01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:25.050
putting out a film on a
UFO crash

1220
01:06:25.084 --> 01:06:26.913
with live aliens in the town.

1221
01:06:26.948 --> 01:06:31.953
but I haven't seen the evidence.

1222
01:06:32.781 --> 01:06:35.992
I mean. it makes sense
that there would be.

1223
01:06:36.026 --> 01:06:37.338
there are sightings here.

1224
01:06:37.372 --> 01:06:39.478
Why wouldn't there be
sightings out there?

1225
01:06:41.169 --> 01:06:42.895
It's not my area of expertise.

1226
01:06:42.929 --> 01:06:45.691
I don't dig into. I
look into the phenomenon

1227
01:06:45.725 --> 01:06:48.245
and if it leads me to
an astronaut. great.

1228
01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:51.938
And if not. you know.
so I just know

1229
01:06:51.973 --> 01:06:54.803
that what Fay Ann Potter told me

1230
01:06:55.770 --> 01:06:57.289
about her brother Buzz Aldrin.

1231
01:06:57.323 --> 01:06:59.843
that they saw something
on the way to the Moon.

1232
01:06:59.877 --> 01:07:03.605
[rhythmic suspenseful music]

1233
01:07:09.508 --> 01:07:14.064
[rhythmic suspenseful
music continues]

1234
01:07:21.106 --> 01:07:23.832
[dramatic music]

1235
01:07:34.188 --> 01:07:36.328
- [Narrator] The lunar
landing was on July 20th

1236
01:07:36.362 --> 01:07:37.881
of that same year.

1237
01:07:37.915 --> 01:07:40.504
And the following day.
two astronauts became

1238
01:07:40.539 --> 01:07:43.404
the first to walk on the
lunar surface.

1239
01:07:43.438 --> 01:07:47.028
[dramatic music continues]

1240
01:08:02.457 --> 01:08:05.564
- [Astronaut] Okay. engine
stop APA at a defense

1241
01:08:05.598 --> 01:08:09.050
or control both auto-dependent
command override off.

1242
01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:10.603
Engine arm off.

1243
01:08:10.638 --> 01:08:12.157
For 13 is in.

1244
01:08:13.537 --> 01:08:15.401
- [Astronaut] We copy it down.
Eagle.

1245
01:08:15.884 --> 01:08:17.196
Houston. uh...

1246
01:08:21.649 --> 01:08:24.824
- [Controller] Roger tranquility
we copy you on the ground.

1247
01:08:24.859 --> 01:08:26.723
You got a bunch of guys
about to turn blue.

1248
01:08:26.757 --> 01:08:28.552
we're breathing again.
thanks a lot.

1249
01:08:29.933 --> 01:08:32.246
- When we did get close
and we rolled out

1250
01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:36.077
and saw it for the first
time. it was a revelation.

1251
01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:40.046
It was gigantic. it
filled our entire window.

1252
01:08:42.911 --> 01:08:44.327
- Flying through the Moon shadow

1253
01:08:44.361 --> 01:08:48.883
and seeing the Sun eclipsed by
the Moon as we approached it.

1254
01:08:48.917 --> 01:08:50.609
that was a very
spectacular sight.

1255
01:08:51.713 --> 01:08:53.784
- [Narrator] Commander
Armstrong was the first human

1256
01:08:53.819 --> 01:08:56.649
to set foot on the surface
of the Earth's satellite

1257
01:08:56.684 --> 01:09:01.689
on July 21st. 1969 at 02:56
UTC. international time

1258
01:09:03.104 --> 01:09:05.417
south of the Sea of Tranquility.

1259
01:09:05.451 --> 01:09:08.420
six and a half hours
after landing on the Moon.

1260
01:09:08.454 --> 01:09:12.217
This historic milestone was
broadcast to the entire planet

1261
01:09:12.251 --> 01:09:15.081
from the Parks Observatory
in Australia.

1262
01:09:15.116 --> 01:09:17.256
- [Neil Armstrong] Here.
men from the planet Earth.

1263
01:09:17.291 --> 01:09:20.156
first step foot upon the moon.
July 1969.

1264
01:09:23.504 --> 01:09:26.265
We came in peace
for all mankind.

1265
01:09:27.232 --> 01:09:29.958
[dramatic music]

1266
01:09:36.655 --> 01:09:40.210
[dramatic music continues]

1267
01:09:46.112 --> 01:09:49.668

[dramatic music continues]

1271
01:10:21.147 --> 01:10:22.045
- [Astronaut] It's beautiful.

1272
01:10:22.079 --> 01:10:23.943
- [Astronaut] Isn't that
something?

1273
01:10:23.978 --> 01:10:28.051
Say here are you talking about
a mysterious looking place.

1274
01:10:28.085 --> 01:10:30.743
They can cut some fresh some
parts of those pictures up.

1275
01:10:30.778 --> 01:10:33.159
Make a nice photograph.

1276
01:10:33.194 --> 01:10:35.921
[dramatic music]

1277
01:10:41.651 --> 01:10:45.241
[dramatic music continues]

1278
01:10:51.523 --> 01:10:53.973
They can cut some fresh some
parts of those pictures up.

1279
01:10:54.008 --> 01:10:56.113
Make a nice photograph.

1280
01:10:56.148 --> 01:10:59.703
[dramatic music continues]

1281
01:11:07.539 --> 01:11:10.196
- There's this thing
that came out about 2014.

1282
01:11:10.231 --> 01:11:12.268
and it's an image that
was found on the internet

1283
01:11:12.302 --> 01:11:13.579
that had actually been posted

1284
01:11:13.614 --> 01:11:16.479
back in the early days
like 2002.

1285
01:11:16.513 --> 01:11:20.276
And it had a number
as1120pyramid20small2.jpg.

1286
01:11:23.451 --> 01:11:25.246
that was the name of the image.

1287
01:11:25.281 --> 01:11:27.938
And it showed what
clearly appears to be

1288
01:11:27.973 --> 01:11:30.286
an artificial structure on
the surface of the Moon.

1289
01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.909
but nobody really knew
where it came from.

1290
01:11:32.943 --> 01:11:36.706
The AS11 indicated that
it was an Apollo 11 shot.

1291
01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:39.225
and it took researchers
quite a while

1292
01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:40.779
to actually find the image.

1293
01:11:40.813 --> 01:11:45.680
And it turned out the
image was AS11-38-5564.

1294
01:11:45.715 --> 01:11:46.612
Now this is interesting.

1295
01:11:46.647 --> 01:11:48.752
because it was an image
that was taken.

1296
01:11:48.787 --> 01:11:51.065
it was a photograph that
was taken

1297
01:11:51.099 --> 01:11:52.929
by one of the Apollo 11
astronauts.

1298
01:11:52.963 --> 01:11:55.932
either Neil Armstrong. Buzz
Aldrin or Michael Collins

1299
01:11:55.966 --> 01:11:59.211
shooting out the window
of the command module

1300
01:11:59.245 --> 01:12:02.352
as they were flying over
the lunar surface

1301
01:12:02.387 --> 01:12:03.905
on trans Earth injection.

1302
01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:05.631
They had already fired
the engine.

1303
01:12:05.666 --> 01:12:06.805
they were heading towards Earth

1304
01:12:06.839 --> 01:12:08.600
and they were just
shooting the hell

1305
01:12:08.634 --> 01:12:10.671
out of the backside of the Moon.

1306
01:12:10.705 --> 01:12:12.983
Now. the interesting
thing about this is that

1307
01:12:13.018 --> 01:12:14.951
they took these pictures just.
again.

1308
01:12:14.985 --> 01:12:16.159
probably with a power winder.

1309
01:12:16.193 --> 01:12:17.402
one after the other.
after the other.

1310
01:12:17.436 --> 01:12:21.337
But the film was so good
that they could take

1311
01:12:22.614 --> 01:12:24.374
just lots and lots of
photographs.

1312
01:12:24.409 --> 01:12:29.379
This is the image as it
appeared in an a NASA archive.

1313
01:12:31.899 --> 01:12:35.247
And it's an image of a
crater called Daedalus.

1314
01:12:35.281 --> 01:12:38.526
Now. this thing is very. very
near the crater Daedalus.

1315
01:12:38.561 --> 01:12:40.804
it's actually Daedalus R.
I believe.

1316
01:12:40.839 --> 01:12:45.844
And Daedalus is dead center
on the back disc of the Moon.

1317
01:12:45.878 --> 01:12:48.225
In other words. it's the
exact antipode.

1318
01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:52.195
the other side of Sinus Medii
where we just saw The Castle.

1319
01:12:52.229 --> 01:12:54.611
So you might expect to
find something there.

1320
01:12:54.646 --> 01:12:57.580
I have a feeling this is why
they were photographing this.

1321
01:12:57.614 --> 01:13:00.583
So in that area. and again.

1322
01:13:00.617 --> 01:13:03.102
this is Sinus Medii with
the triangular crater.

1323
01:13:03.137 --> 01:13:04.759
pretty interesting stuff.

1324
01:13:04.794 --> 01:13:07.141
And then on the back
you have this Ziggurat.

1325
01:13:07.175 --> 01:13:09.039
So. as we looked at this thing.

1326
01:13:10.765 --> 01:13:13.216
it began to look more
and more like something

1327
01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:16.184
that was completely artificial
and did not belong there.

1328
01:13:16.219 --> 01:13:19.878
And again. I went through
it. did some enhancement.

1329
01:13:21.224 --> 01:13:22.536
tried to get more detail out.

1330
01:13:22.570 --> 01:13:24.641
And what you see.
or at least what I saw

1331
01:13:24.676 --> 01:13:27.610
is these four walls.
this wall structure.

1332
01:13:28.956 --> 01:13:32.235
sort of a weird angled
front end to it.

1333
01:13:32.269 --> 01:13:33.995
Kind of there's a triangle
shape there.

1334
01:13:34.030 --> 01:13:38.448
and then there's like a
central box with maybe windows.

1335
01:13:38.483 --> 01:13:40.588
There's a passageway to
actually enter it

1336
01:13:40.623 --> 01:13:42.625
and like a little dome on top.

1337
01:13:42.659 --> 01:13:43.833
Pretty bizarre stuff.

1338
01:13:43.867 --> 01:13:46.249
Well. somebody pointed
out this looks a lot like

1339
01:13:46.283 --> 01:13:51.288
the Ziggurat at Ur in
Mesopotamia or modern day Iraq.

1340
01:13:51.496 --> 01:13:53.359
And yeah. here's this
basic structure.

1341
01:13:53.394 --> 01:13:56.777
Here's these entrances.
these walkways.

1342
01:13:56.811 --> 01:13:58.537
this is what it looked like
when they first found it

1343
01:13:58.572 --> 01:14:02.472
in the 1930s and it's
now been re-excavated.

1344
01:14:02.507 --> 01:14:04.336
And this is what the original
structure looked like.

1345
01:14:04.370 --> 01:14:05.613
You have exterior walls.

1346
01:14:05.648 --> 01:14:07.995
you have an interior
square structure.

1347
01:14:08.029 --> 01:14:09.686
you have a single
entranceway.

1348
01:14:09.721 --> 01:14:12.240
which is how they were
set up for defense.

1349
01:14:12.275 --> 01:14:15.934
And then you have these
ramps leading up to it.

1350
01:14:15.968 --> 01:14:18.143
Now. if you were to take
these ramps

1351
01:14:19.178 --> 01:14:22.147
and like fill them in.
again. here's a little dome.

1352
01:14:22.181 --> 01:14:25.081
So. a little dome right here
on top of the structure.

1353
01:14:25.115 --> 01:14:27.463
So. it looks basically like this

1354
01:14:27.497 --> 01:14:29.188
Like there's an
exterior structure

1355
01:14:29.223 --> 01:14:32.468
and an interior structure
like a Ziggurat.

1356
01:14:32.502 --> 01:14:34.055
And again. I'm gonna remind you.
okay.

1357
01:14:34.090 --> 01:14:36.333
here's a dome. here's a
little dome.

1358
01:14:36.368 --> 01:14:37.887
here's an interior
square structure.

1359
01:14:37.921 --> 01:14:39.613
here's the interior square
structure.

1360
01:14:39.647 --> 01:14:42.098
here's the exterior walls.
there they are.

1361
01:14:42.132 --> 01:14:45.239
And then here's. if you
took this area

1362
01:14:45.273 --> 01:14:48.173
and filled it in.
it would look with dirt.

1363
01:14:48.207 --> 01:14:51.590
it would look probably
just like this thing does.

1364
01:14:51.625 --> 01:14:56.250
The problem is when
you go to AS11-38-5564.

1365
01:14:58.424 --> 01:15:00.219
it doesn't really look
quite the same.

1366
01:15:00.254 --> 01:15:03.533
So we finally found the object
near the crater Daedalus R.

1367
01:15:03.568 --> 01:15:05.362
This is the area involved.

1368
01:15:05.397 --> 01:15:07.917
This is the original image
that was found

1369
01:15:07.951 --> 01:15:10.195
by a guy named KK Samurai.
by the way.

1370
01:15:10.229 --> 01:15:11.748
That was what he called himself.

1371
01:15:11.783 --> 01:15:14.440
He's the one who found that
he was given this image

1372
01:15:14.475 --> 01:15:17.236
by a very interesting character.

1373
01:15:17.271 --> 01:15:21.068
So here is the Daedalus
Ziggurat. on today's image.

1374
01:15:21.102 --> 01:15:22.725
It's gone. right? Where is it?

1375
01:15:22.759 --> 01:15:25.106
Well. it's actually
supposed to be right here.

1376
01:15:25.141 --> 01:15:26.107
right here in the middle.

1377
01:15:26.142 --> 01:15:28.109
But there's the front ramps.
there's the.

1378
01:15:28.144 --> 01:15:29.317
but it's all gone.

1379
01:15:29.352 --> 01:15:32.700
It's just blank. it's
nothing but a crater.

1380
01:15:33.425 --> 01:15:36.566
And again. I did the best
I could with it.

1381
01:15:36.601 --> 01:15:38.464
with what they have on
NASA's surface now.

1382
01:15:38.499 --> 01:15:41.364
It doesn't look like
really anything.

1383
01:15:41.398 --> 01:15:43.297
They've blurred it out.
They've... [inaudible]

1384
01:15:45.264 --> 01:15:46.196
They've added shadows.

1385
01:15:46.231 --> 01:15:47.439
And again. I'm gonna
tell you again.

1386
01:15:47.473 --> 01:15:50.028
I went and analyzed the
interior of this crater

1387
01:15:50.062 --> 01:15:51.685
and this area here.

1388
01:15:51.719 --> 01:15:55.412
And again. it's one color.
pitch black.

1389
01:15:55.447 --> 01:15:56.482
over the entire thing.

1390
01:15:56.517 --> 01:15:59.865
That means they drew on
this. they drew on this.

1391
01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:03.006
If they drew on this. they
drew on other parts of it too.

1392
01:16:03.041 --> 01:16:07.183
So. again. from a
distance. as you step back.

1393
01:16:07.217 --> 01:16:09.392
it kind of looks like the
same thing.

1394
01:16:09.426 --> 01:16:11.774
but it actually really doesn't.

1395
01:16:11.808 --> 01:16:13.879
They're trying to convince
you this is nothing.

1396
01:16:13.914 --> 01:16:15.156
but an optical illusion.

1397
01:16:16.364 --> 01:16:19.851
Now. I got into very
strong conflict

1398
01:16:19.885 --> 01:16:21.507
with a couple of NASA guys
over there.

1399
01:16:21.542 --> 01:16:23.475
They're like. oh. it's
obviously nothing.

1400
01:16:23.509 --> 01:16:26.685
You know. you can't.
yeah. you're crazy.

1401
01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:28.929
You don't know what
you're looking at.

1402
01:16:28.963 --> 01:16:31.000
But clearly what's happened
here is that

1403
01:16:31.034 --> 01:16:34.003
the original image from
which KK Samurai

1404
01:16:34.037 --> 01:16:37.385
drew his conclusions
and his version

1405
01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:40.561
is completely different
than 5564.

1406
01:16:40.596 --> 01:16:44.323
The problem is. is we didn't
know at the time originally

1407
01:16:44.358 --> 01:16:48.707
where he got this
interesting version.

1408
01:16:48.742 --> 01:16:51.468
Where did he get it
from. and what was on it?

1409
01:16:51.503 --> 01:16:53.609
But here's the thing.
this is supposed to be

1410
01:16:53.643 --> 01:16:54.955
the Ziggurat right here.

1411
01:16:54.989 --> 01:16:59.269
But as I looked at this
image. I found that there was.

1412
01:16:59.304 --> 01:17:00.995
even though they had
erased the Ziggurat.

1413
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:02.583
there was a lot of other
interesting stuff

1414
01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:03.653
on here they didn't erase.

1415
01:17:03.688 --> 01:17:05.379
A lot of interesting stuff.

1416
01:17:06.242 --> 01:17:07.864
These are some of the
areas that are marked

1417
01:17:07.899 --> 01:17:09.970
as we go through them
real quickly.

1418
01:17:10.004 --> 01:17:13.663
There's this particular.
um. guy.

1419
01:17:13.698 --> 01:17:15.354
which is just a sort of
a normal crater.

1420
01:17:15.389 --> 01:17:17.529
But then what is this
thing up above here?

1421
01:17:17.563 --> 01:17:19.565
What is this one up here?

1422
01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:23.190
Number five. up in the
corner of the image.

1423
01:17:23.224 --> 01:17:25.054
And as we zoom up on that.

1424
01:17:25.088 --> 01:17:28.333
I see stuff that with my
trained eye

1425
01:17:28.367 --> 01:17:29.679
looks really. really weird.

1426
01:17:29.714 --> 01:17:30.991
This is the area where they have

1427
01:17:31.025 --> 01:17:33.579
blacked out the sky behind this.

1428
01:17:33.614 --> 01:17:34.684
Well. what is this thing?

1429
01:17:34.719 --> 01:17:38.792
Well. if you look at
it. it's pretty bizarre.

1430
01:17:38.826 --> 01:17:42.830
because what you've got
here is this is a hangar

1431
01:17:44.004 --> 01:17:46.627
cut into the side of
this mountain.

1432
01:17:47.524 --> 01:17:50.010
It's filled in with debris
in the front.

1433
01:17:50.044 --> 01:17:51.218
And that would be the
other side.

1434
01:17:51.252 --> 01:17:52.944
You're looking at it at an angle

1435
01:17:52.978 --> 01:17:57.051
and then this is some sort
of disc shape

1436
01:17:57.086 --> 01:17:59.433
with something else going on.

1437
01:17:59.467 --> 01:18:02.470
Like what the hell are
these things?

1438
01:18:02.505 --> 01:18:07.510
See. stone. spire. stone.
spire. stone. what are they?

1439
01:18:07.786 --> 01:18:09.546
But it's right there and
they're all in the same area.

1440
01:18:09.581 --> 01:18:12.929
Because if you have one anomaly.
no matter how clear it is.

1441
01:18:12.964 --> 01:18:15.207
if there's nothing else
around it.

1442
01:18:15.242 --> 01:18:16.726
you can't really say
it's something.

1443
01:18:16.761 --> 01:18:20.005
It could just be. again. a
really bizarre looking artifact.

1444
01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:24.561
So let's go back and
look. this is another.

1445
01:18:24.596 --> 01:18:26.771
there's like a tube that
you can follow

1446
01:18:26.805 --> 01:18:29.877
that runs for miles and
miles along the surface

1447
01:18:29.912 --> 01:18:33.122
and then seems to attach
itself like a drill

1448
01:18:33.156 --> 01:18:36.297
underneath this overhanging
ridge.

1449
01:18:36.332 --> 01:18:37.471
This thing is hanging there.

1450
01:18:37.505 --> 01:18:38.714
There's all kinds of structure.

1451
01:18:38.748 --> 01:18:39.853
It's just bizarre.

1452
01:18:41.786 --> 01:18:44.271
- People who come here
to this museum

1453
01:18:44.305 --> 01:18:48.724
and look at our spacecraft.
Columbia.

1454
01:18:48.758 --> 01:18:51.761
are most often struck by
its small size.

1455
01:18:51.796 --> 01:18:54.695
which from their perspective
is understandable.

1456
01:18:55.972 --> 01:18:58.630
From our point of view.
the command module

1457
01:18:58.664 --> 01:19:03.083
was a wonderful improvement
over our previous spacecraft.

1458
01:19:03.117 --> 01:19:05.050
which were really cramped.

1459
01:19:05.085 --> 01:19:09.192
And so. we enjoyed the luxury
of a big volume machine.

1460
01:19:09.227 --> 01:19:12.092
- Yeah. I thought we had
amazingly good accommodations.

1461
01:19:12.126 --> 01:19:13.610
We had hot and cold water.

1462
01:19:13.645 --> 01:19:15.578
The food was even edible.

1463
01:19:15.612 --> 01:19:20.617
All in all. it was a nicely
packaged. small enclosure.

1464
01:19:22.688 --> 01:19:24.967
and we could comfortably
have stayed there

1465
01:19:25.001 --> 01:19:27.383
far in excessive eight days.

1466
01:19:27.417 --> 01:19:29.730
- [Narrator] On July
24th. the three astronauts

1467
01:19:29.765 --> 01:19:32.526
achieved a perfect
splash down in the waters

1468
01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:34.873
of the Pacific Ocean
ending the mission.

1469
01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:39.705
[inspirational music]

1470
01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:43.261
- Well. it proved that
the United States

1471
01:19:43.295 --> 01:19:46.540
could accomplish
tremendous goals

1472
01:19:46.574 --> 01:19:48.714
if they worked together
as a team.

1473
01:19:49.715 --> 01:19:52.339
- After the flight of Apollo 11.

1474
01:19:52.373 --> 01:19:54.824
Neil Armstrong. Buzz Alder and I

1475
01:19:54.859 --> 01:19:57.275
had an around the world tour.

1476
01:19:57.309 --> 01:20:00.519
And every place we went.
I thought they'd

1477
01:20:01.658 --> 01:20:03.591
in some places have the
attitude of.

1478
01:20:03.626 --> 01:20:06.077
oh. well you Americans
finally did this.

1479
01:20:06.111 --> 01:20:09.839
Not at all. the attitude.
every country.

1480
01:20:09.874 --> 01:20:12.877
regardless of their
internal politics.

1481
01:20:12.911 --> 01:20:15.638
they all said. we did it.
we humans.

1482
01:20:21.195 --> 01:20:24.371
[audience applauding]

1483
01:20:30.342 --> 01:20:34.346
[audience applauding continues]

1484
01:20:37.177 --> 01:20:38.695
- It was our pleasure to have

1485
01:20:38.730 --> 01:20:41.664
participated in one
great adventure.

1486
01:20:43.666 --> 01:20:45.047
It's an adventure
that took place

1487
01:20:45.081 --> 01:20:47.635
not just in the month of July.

1488
01:20:48.636 --> 01:20:51.674
but rather one that took
place in the last decade.

1489
01:20:56.299 --> 01:21:00.821
We all here and the
people listening in today

1490
01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:03.893
had the opportunity to
share that adventure

1491
01:21:03.928 --> 01:21:06.102
over its developing
and unfolding

1492
01:21:07.863 --> 01:21:09.934
in the past months and years.

1493
01:21:11.901 --> 01:21:16.009
It's our privilege today
to share with you

1494
01:21:17.424 --> 01:21:22.429
some of the details of
that final month of July.

1495
01:21:25.294 --> 01:21:29.781
That was certainly the highlight

1496
01:21:29.815 --> 01:21:33.578
for the three of us of
that decade.

1497
01:21:35.028 --> 01:21:37.064
We're going to divert
a little bit

1498
01:21:37.099 --> 01:21:41.689
from the format of past
press conferences

1499
01:21:42.656 --> 01:21:47.661
and talk about the things
that interested us most.

1500
01:21:48.696 --> 01:21:53.356
In particular. the things
that occurred

1501
01:21:54.426 --> 01:21:56.152
on and about the Moon.

1502
01:21:56.187 --> 01:21:58.361
- [Reporter] Apollo 11
astronaut. Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin.

1503
01:21:58.396 --> 01:22:00.191
the second man to walk
on the Moon.

1504
01:22:00.225 --> 01:22:02.745
has actually given an
interview where he confirmed

1505
01:22:02.779 --> 01:22:04.712
that certain segments
of his Apollo mission

1506
01:22:04.747 --> 01:22:06.266
were indeed carefully scripted

1507
01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:09.441
to control exactly what
the public saw and heard.

1508
01:22:09.476 --> 01:22:11.788
Back in 2003. Aldrin was
interviewed

1509
01:22:11.823 --> 01:22:14.619
for Neil Armstrong's only
authorized biography.

1510
01:22:14.653 --> 01:22:16.862
And during that interview.
he was asked about

1511
01:22:16.897 --> 01:22:19.003
whether some of the live
television transmissions

1512
01:22:19.037 --> 01:22:21.143
that were made from the
CSM during the flight

1513
01:22:21.177 --> 01:22:23.628
really were improvised
and unscripted.

1514
01:22:23.662 --> 01:22:26.355
And in response. Aldrin
first admits that NASA

1515
01:22:26.389 --> 01:22:29.047
quote went to great lengths
unquote

1516
01:22:29.082 --> 01:22:31.498
to make sure that they
appeared unscripted.

1517
01:22:31.532 --> 01:22:33.362
And he then goes on to
say the following.

1518
01:22:33.396 --> 01:22:35.191
and I'll quote Aldrin
directly here.

1519
01:22:48.756 --> 01:22:53.727
- We will use a number
of films and slides.

1520
01:22:55.591 --> 01:22:58.076
which most of you have
already seen.

1521
01:22:59.836 --> 01:23:04.186
and with the intent of
pointing out

1522
01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:07.361
some of the things that
we observed on the spot.

1523
01:23:07.396 --> 01:23:11.503
which may not be
obvious to those of you

1524
01:23:11.538 --> 01:23:17.544
who are looking at them here
from the surface of Earth.

1525
01:23:18.027 --> 01:23:20.788
- [Narrator] This motion
picture DAC footage

1526
01:23:20.823 --> 01:23:24.723
was recorded during the Apollo
11 ascent back into orbit

1527
01:23:24.758 --> 01:23:28.003
and famously presents an orb-lik

1528
01:23:28.037 --> 01:23:30.108
flying along the lunar horizon.

1529
01:23:33.387 --> 01:23:36.011
[ominous music]

1530
01:23:42.017 --> 01:23:46.193
- What's very interesting about
the Apollo 11 manned mission

1531
01:23:46.228 --> 01:23:51.233
is that this mission also would
be very rife with rumors of

1532
01:23:52.096 --> 01:23:57.066
anomalous or UFO activity
out there on the Moon.

1533
01:23:57.653 --> 01:24:00.138
In fact. one of the rumors
that's quite prevalent

1534
01:24:00.173 --> 01:24:03.797
is that a craft was waiting.

1535
01:24:03.831 --> 01:24:07.525
A non-terrestrial craft was
waiting on the lunar surface

1536
01:24:07.559 --> 01:24:09.665
for the Apollo 11 astronauts

1537
01:24:09.699 --> 01:24:12.771
when they did their first
Moon walks.

1538
01:24:12.806 --> 01:24:17.155
Another rumor that actually
came from Buzz Aldrin.

1539
01:24:17.190 --> 01:24:19.399
the Apollo 11 astronaut himself.

1540
01:24:19.433 --> 01:24:24.404
was that a UFO was following
the Apollo spacecraft

1541
01:24:24.852 --> 01:24:29.236
on the way to the Moon in
the middle of cislunar space.

1542
01:24:29.271 --> 01:24:31.928
And the astronauts had
tracked it

1543
01:24:31.963 --> 01:24:34.828
while they were floating
through space.

1544
01:24:34.862 --> 01:24:37.520
[ominous music]

1545
01:24:44.044 --> 01:24:48.324
[ominous music continues]

1546
01:24:55.020 --> 01:24:58.645
- Buzz Aldrin could have been
one of these important figures

1547
01:24:58.679 --> 01:25:02.097
that actually proved there
is UFO activity

1548
01:25:02.131 --> 01:25:04.029
happening in outer space.

1549
01:25:04.858 --> 01:25:07.999
But unfortunately. he
became very contradictory

1550
01:25:08.033 --> 01:25:11.416
on his initial story in
mainstream media.

1551
01:25:14.178 --> 01:25:19.183
- There was something out
there that was close enough

1552
01:25:19.907 --> 01:25:23.635
to be observed and. uh.
what could it be?

1553
01:25:27.846 --> 01:25:31.402
Mike decided he thought he
could see it in the telescope

1554
01:25:31.436 --> 01:25:33.024
and he was able to do that.

1555
01:25:33.058 --> 01:25:35.613
And when it was in one position

1556
01:25:35.647 --> 01:25:37.925
that had a series of ellipses.

1557
01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:39.479
but when you made it real sharp.

1558
01:25:39.513 --> 01:25:42.896
it was sort of L-shaped that
didn't tell us very much.

1559
01:25:42.930 --> 01:25:47.901
Now obviously. the three of
us were not gonna blurt out.

1560
01:25:47.935 --> 01:25:51.042
Hey Houston. we got something
moving alongside of us

1561
01:25:51.076 --> 01:25:52.768
and we don't know what it is.

1562
01:25:52.802 --> 01:25:54.218
Can you tell us what it is?

1563
01:25:54.252 --> 01:25:56.081
We weren't about to do that.

1564
01:25:56.944 --> 01:25:59.637
'cause we know that
those transmissions

1565
01:25:59.671 --> 01:26:01.363
would be heard by all
sorts of people

1566
01:26:01.397 --> 01:26:04.366
and who knows what
somebody would've demanded

1567
01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:07.300
that we turned back
because of aliens

1568
01:26:07.334 --> 01:26:09.750
or whatever the reason is.

1569
01:26:09.785 --> 01:26:13.892
So. we didn't do that.
but we did decide.

1570
01:26:13.927 --> 01:26:18.518
we just cautiously ask
Houston where.

1571
01:26:18.552 --> 01:26:21.037
how far away was the S4B.

1572
01:26:21.072 --> 01:26:23.971
And a few moments later
why they came back

1573
01:26:24.006 --> 01:26:27.768
and said something like.
it was 6.000 miles away.

1574
01:26:27.803 --> 01:26:29.322
because of the maneuver.

1575
01:26:29.356 --> 01:26:31.565
So. we really didn't think
we were

1576
01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:34.603
looking at something
that far away.

1577
01:26:34.637 --> 01:26:38.296
So. we decided that after
a while of watching it.

1578
01:26:38.331 --> 01:26:41.437
it was time to go to sleep and
not to talk about it anymore

1579
01:26:41.472 --> 01:26:44.233
until we came back
in debriefing.

1580
01:26:44.268 --> 01:26:47.409
I saw this illumination that
was moving

1581
01:26:47.443 --> 01:26:49.859
with respect to the stars.

1582
01:26:49.894 --> 01:26:52.690
We were smart enough to not say.

1583
01:26:52.724 --> 01:26:55.693
Houston. there's a light out
there that's following us.

1584
01:26:56.728 --> 01:27:01.595
So. technically becomes an
unidentified flying object.

1585
01:27:01.630 --> 01:27:02.458
[Echo] Flying object.

1586
01:27:04.357 --> 01:27:05.185
[indistinct]

1587
01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:07.083
- All I can think about.

1588
01:27:07.118 --> 01:27:13.089
But in any case. I was on
set and I was just a gopher

1589
01:27:13.124 --> 01:27:15.575
and I turned out I got
a little role.

1590
01:27:15.609 --> 01:27:18.854
but Mickey Rooney was like.
"Oh. what are you doing

1591
01:27:18.888 --> 01:27:20.614
when you're not here
helping us out?"

1592
01:27:20.649 --> 01:27:23.548
And I said. "I'm making a
UFO film."

1593
01:27:23.583 --> 01:27:26.448
He goes. "Oh. I'm friends
with Buzz Aldrin

1594
01:27:26.482 --> 01:27:28.795
and you should talk
to him sometime.

1595
01:27:28.829 --> 01:27:31.315
He's got some pretty
interesting stories."

1596
01:27:31.349 --> 01:27:35.353
And so. that was my initial
in with Buzz Aldrin.

1597
01:27:36.043 --> 01:27:36.768
Um.

1598
01:27:37.838 --> 01:27:43.465
And then I would say
probably three years later

1599
01:27:44.707 --> 01:27:49.781
I met Fay Ann Potter.
Buzz Aldrin's sister.

1600
01:27:49.816 --> 01:27:51.818
So I'm talking to Fay
Ann Potter and I said.

1601
01:27:51.852 --> 01:27:56.926
I found out it was her
brother was Buzz Aldrin.

1602
01:27:56.961 --> 01:28:01.103
And I'm like. I worked
on this movie set

1603
01:28:01.137 --> 01:28:03.312
and I found out through
Mickey Rooney

1604
01:28:03.347 --> 01:28:05.556
that your brother had
a sighting. some...

1605
01:28:05.590 --> 01:28:07.937
but I didn't get any specifics.

1606
01:28:07.972 --> 01:28:12.977
She said. oh yeah. he had
two encounters with UFOs

1607
01:28:13.011 --> 01:28:14.703
and one was when
he was piloting.

1608
01:28:14.737 --> 01:28:15.807
this is what she told me.

1609
01:28:15.842 --> 01:28:18.983
this is what Buzz Aldrin's
sister told me. okay?

1610
01:28:20.329 --> 01:28:23.815
She said that he had. and I
don't know what year it was.

1611
01:28:23.850 --> 01:28:26.024
but I think it was before
he went to the Moon.

1612
01:28:26.059 --> 01:28:31.064
He was flying a fighter
jet and he chased a disc.

1613
01:28:31.582 --> 01:28:36.311
And she said that he was
so moved by the experience

1614
01:28:36.345 --> 01:28:38.899
that he called her and he
was still shaking from it.

1615
01:28:38.934 --> 01:28:41.419
He said he chased it till
he couldn't go any higher.

1616
01:28:41.454 --> 01:28:42.903
didn't catch it.

1617
01:28:43.801 --> 01:28:44.940
That's what she told me.

1618
01:28:44.974 --> 01:28:48.323
Then she said he also told her

1619
01:28:48.357 --> 01:28:50.152
that they...

1620
01:28:51.464 --> 01:28:52.568
saw something.

1621
01:28:52.603 --> 01:28:55.295
or something followed
them to the Moon.

1622
01:28:55.330 --> 01:28:56.814
But it was like not just
a quick sighting.

1623
01:28:56.848 --> 01:28:58.988
I think it went on for
like a day or two.

1624
01:28:59.023 --> 01:29:00.231
That's what she told me.

1625
01:29:01.405 --> 01:29:05.995
So. between Fay Ann
Potter and Mickey Rooney

1626
01:29:07.618 --> 01:29:09.827
and his wife. Jan Rooney.

1627
01:29:10.759 --> 01:29:11.932
they said.

1628
01:29:11.967 --> 01:29:14.038
we think we can get you an
interview with Buzz Aldrin.

1629
01:29:14.797 --> 01:29:18.732
So. they got my foot in the
door. they contacted him.

1630
01:29:18.767 --> 01:29:20.665
Good kid. he's doing
this documentary

1631
01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:23.703
and Buzz Aldrin agrees
to meet with me.

1632
01:29:23.737 --> 01:29:25.498
- He's in Europe.

1633
01:29:25.532 --> 01:29:26.740
- That's the problem.

1634
01:29:26.775 --> 01:29:30.192
He was in France on tour for
some book that he was doing.

1635
01:29:31.158 --> 01:29:34.092
Yes. I'll meet with James.
but I'm on this book tour

1636
01:29:34.127 --> 01:29:36.543
and I'm gonna be in Monte
Carlo on these dates.

1637
01:29:36.578 --> 01:29:38.683
If he wants to meet me
in Monte Carlo

1638
01:29:38.718 --> 01:29:40.892
I'll meet with him and
do an interview.

1639
01:29:41.203 --> 01:29:43.170
So of course. I'm gonna do that.

1640
01:29:43.205 --> 01:29:45.138
And I've got Buzz Aldrin.
I think I've borrowed money

1641
01:29:45.172 --> 01:29:46.484
from somebody.
I can't remember who.

1642
01:29:46.519 --> 01:29:51.765
And we get to his hotel and
the concierge comes and says.

1643
01:29:52.179 --> 01:29:56.011
Mr. Fox? say. Yes?
You have a telephone call.

1644
01:29:56.045 --> 01:29:57.564
And I. okay.

1645
01:29:57.599 --> 01:30:01.913
And he gives me the phone
and it's Buzz Aldrin.

1646
01:30:03.156 --> 01:30:04.399
I can't do the interview.

1647
01:30:05.538 --> 01:30:07.885
I said. it's like. what do
you mean

1648
01:30:07.919 --> 01:30:08.713
you can't do the interview?

1649
01:30:08.748 --> 01:30:09.507
I traveled all this way.

1650
01:30:09.542 --> 01:30:11.371
He said. I can't do it.

1651
01:30:11.406 --> 01:30:15.168
He said. it was Paul Allen.

1652
01:30:15.513 --> 01:30:16.238
- [Darcy Weir] Paul Allen?

1653
01:30:16.272 --> 01:30:17.929
- It was Paul Allen.

1654
01:30:17.964 --> 01:30:20.622
He said. Paul Allen
just invested in SETI

1655
01:30:21.139 --> 01:30:23.935
and he was labeled a UFO
quack. something like that.

1656
01:30:23.970 --> 01:30:25.558
- And he didn't wanna
be labeled.

1657
01:30:25.592 --> 01:30:27.767
- And he said. I'm trying
to get money from Congress

1658
01:30:27.801 --> 01:30:30.079
to develop a rocket that'll
put citizens in space

1659
01:30:30.114 --> 01:30:32.875
and I will not jeopardize
that initiative.

1660
01:30:32.910 --> 01:30:35.775
And how's my coming forward
gonna change anything anyway.

1661
01:30:36.879 --> 01:30:40.296
And I responded how I felt
and I said.

1662
01:30:40.331 --> 01:30:42.298
well. with all due respect. sir.

1663
01:30:42.333 --> 01:30:43.748
it takes people of your stature

1664
01:30:43.783 --> 01:30:46.510
to elevate this whole.
you know. phenomenon

1665
01:30:46.544 --> 01:30:48.132
out of the rut that it's in.

1666
01:30:48.166 --> 01:30:50.686
And your contribution.
your testimony.

1667
01:30:50.721 --> 01:30:52.516
would be of the utmost
significance.

1668
01:30:52.826 --> 01:30:55.519
You know?
He said. well. I'm not doing it.

1669
01:30:55.553 --> 01:30:58.176
And he was almost kind
of angry or something

1670
01:30:58.211 --> 01:31:00.420
like. well. I did
something wrong. you know?

1671
01:31:00.593 --> 01:31:01.386
And. um.

1672
01:31:02.491 --> 01:31:03.734
But he said. how's my story
gonna change anything?

1673
01:31:03.768 --> 01:31:05.011
He didn't deny it at all.

1674
01:31:05.045 --> 01:31:06.909
And he was gonna go on
camera and tell me about it.

1675
01:31:08.635 --> 01:31:11.500
- 12 men have ever
walked on the Moon.

1676
01:31:11.535 --> 01:31:14.538
And the man who
did it the second time

1677
01:31:14.572 --> 01:31:16.298
anyone walked on the Moon
was Buzz Aldrin.

1678
01:31:16.332 --> 01:31:18.749
He was part of the first
mission that got there.

1679
01:31:18.783 --> 01:31:20.647
The national astronaut
on Apollo 11.

1680
01:31:20.682 --> 01:31:22.925
He's here with a model
of Apollo 11.

1681
01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:25.928
He was with the first pair
with Neil Armstrong. of course.

1682
01:31:25.963 --> 01:31:27.551
And Buzz. the panel
remains so that

1683
01:31:27.585 --> 01:31:29.138
they might wanna pop
something at him.

1684
01:31:29.173 --> 01:31:31.831
But Buzz. what's your
connection with this program?

1685
01:31:31.865 --> 01:31:32.866
What did you see?

1686
01:31:33.798 --> 01:31:34.868
- What did I see?

1687
01:31:36.456 --> 01:31:41.461
Well. the first day out.
maybe six hours after launch.

1688
01:31:43.946 --> 01:31:46.017
we were scheduled to make
a mid-course correction.

1689
01:31:46.052 --> 01:31:48.848
I'd like to show you a
few things in this rocket

1690
01:31:48.882 --> 01:31:51.540
just to point out the
condition that we were in.

1691
01:31:51.575 --> 01:31:56.683
We separate the command
and service module

1692
01:31:56.718 --> 01:31:59.065
and it turns around like this

1693
01:31:59.099 --> 01:32:00.963
and it docks with the
lunar module.

1694
01:32:00.998 --> 01:32:04.519
Now. notice these three
and four panels.

1695
01:32:05.589 --> 01:32:08.661
whenever the command module
separates and turns around.

1696
01:32:08.695 --> 01:32:12.561
those panels go off in
four different directions.

1697
01:32:12.596 --> 01:32:14.563
And we can look out
these windows

1698
01:32:14.598 --> 01:32:17.324
and see the Earth drift by
and see the Moon drift by.

1699
01:32:17.359 --> 01:32:18.153
- [Larry King] And what
did you see?

1700
01:32:18.187 --> 01:32:19.810
- And I saw a light out there.

1701
01:32:19.844 --> 01:32:22.571
Okay. this is after we
had witnessed

1702
01:32:22.606 --> 01:32:25.643
the upper stage rocket
next to us

1703
01:32:25.678 --> 01:32:29.095
make an evasive maneuver
to miss the Moon.

1704
01:32:29.129 --> 01:32:30.890
And we thought.
wonder what that is?

1705
01:32:30.924 --> 01:32:32.374
You know. there are a
lot of lights out there

1706
01:32:32.408 --> 01:32:34.583
when you're not looking in
the direction of the Sun.

1707
01:32:34.618 --> 01:32:37.448
There are a lot of stars
and they're all fixed

1708
01:32:37.482 --> 01:32:38.587
relative to each other.

1709
01:32:38.622 --> 01:32:41.486
Now. one of 'em starts
moving or it's moving

1710
01:32:41.521 --> 01:32:44.869
and we know that that's another
object. it's not a star.

1711
01:32:44.904 --> 01:32:47.182
We started thinking a
little bit more

1712
01:32:47.216 --> 01:32:50.461
about these four panels
and I'd seen a graph

1713
01:32:50.495 --> 01:32:52.912
where it showed the
separation distance

1714
01:32:52.946 --> 01:32:55.466
that was calculated
before liftoff.

1715
01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:57.123
before the whole mission went

1716
01:32:57.157 --> 01:32:59.953
of where these panels would be

1717
01:33:01.161 --> 01:33:03.405
in case the spacecraft
made some maneuver

1718
01:33:03.439 --> 01:33:05.510
and they guaranteed
there'd be no.

1719
01:33:05.545 --> 01:33:07.512
- Hold it right there.
you got me hooked.

1720
01:33:07.547 --> 01:33:08.755
- Fast forward...

1721
01:33:09.031 --> 01:33:10.239
- many years later.
- Oh yeah. oh yeah.

1722
01:33:10.274 --> 01:33:12.345
- Oh my God.
- you were on CNN.

1723
01:33:12.379 --> 01:33:13.588
- So I had no idea.

1724
01:33:14.416 --> 01:33:17.143
I get- I had broken a story
with Fife Symington

1725
01:33:17.177 --> 01:33:20.353
who was the former
Governor of Arizona. okay?

1726
01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:21.941
- And-
- The Phoenix Lights.

1727
01:33:21.975 --> 01:33:24.702
- The Phoenix Lights
case that he had not only

1728
01:33:24.737 --> 01:33:27.532
that he'd seen it. he did
actually investigate it

1729
01:33:27.567 --> 01:33:29.327
and that he felt
it was otherworld.

1730
01:33:29.362 --> 01:33:30.535
It was a big story.

1731
01:33:30.570 --> 01:33:35.575
And I was all over the news
and we got invited on CNN.

1732
01:33:37.094 --> 01:33:39.614
I think it was the 60th
anniversary of Roswell.

1733
01:33:39.648 --> 01:33:40.580
but I'm not positive.

1734
01:33:40.615 --> 01:33:41.408
- Larry King Live.

1735
01:33:41.443 --> 01:33:42.686
- Yeah. Larry King Live.

1736
01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:45.412
And I see Buzz Aldrin
in the green room.

1737
01:33:45.447 --> 01:33:47.311
and I walked outta
the green room

1738
01:33:47.345 --> 01:33:48.864
and I turned over to
Fife Symington.

1739
01:33:48.899 --> 01:33:49.934
the former Governor of Arizona.

1740
01:33:49.969 --> 01:33:52.696
And I said. man.
I can't wait to go.

1741
01:33:52.730 --> 01:33:54.421
This is the first time
I've seen him

1742
01:33:54.456 --> 01:33:56.872
since he canceled this interview
with me 10 years earlier.

1743
01:33:56.907 --> 01:33:57.942
or whatever it was.

1744
01:33:59.185 --> 01:34:01.912
And really no explanation
given I borrowed all this money

1745
01:34:01.946 --> 01:34:04.328
and I know he's had these.

1746
01:34:04.362 --> 01:34:06.917
they're gonna get him out here
just debunking everything.

1747
01:34:06.951 --> 01:34:08.988
And Fife says. you know. James.

1748
01:34:09.229 --> 01:34:12.232
that guy's an iconic figure
in the United States history.

1749
01:34:12.267 --> 01:34:14.959
I mean. he landed on the
Moon with Neil Armstrong.

1750
01:34:14.994 --> 01:34:16.858
You really can't be doing that

1751
01:34:16.892 --> 01:34:20.482
to him on a national
live TV show.

1752
01:34:20.516 --> 01:34:22.518
- He might even punch you.

1753
01:34:22.553 --> 01:34:25.694
- But he is a big. he is
a very famous. respected.

1754
01:34:25.729 --> 01:34:26.868
- He's a hero.
- He's a hero.

1755
01:34:26.902 --> 01:34:28.524
- And so I toned it down

1756
01:34:28.559 --> 01:34:30.078
and then I just watched him.

1757
01:34:31.182 --> 01:34:33.840
basically lie on live television

1758
01:34:34.945 --> 01:34:36.601
- What did I see
during the flight?

1759
01:34:36.636 --> 01:34:37.533
- [Larry King] Yeah. you saw-
- We saw

1760
01:34:37.568 --> 01:34:41.054
- one of the four panels.
the 99.999.

1761
01:34:41.089 --> 01:34:44.092
- Okay. I was told by a
very close source of yours

1762
01:34:44.126 --> 01:34:48.406
that you actually saw
something other than that.

1763
01:34:49.028 --> 01:34:51.582
- A lot of people have
said things that I saw.

1764
01:34:51.616 --> 01:34:53.308
- I don't want to reveal
the source.

1765
01:34:53.342 --> 01:34:54.619
- That doesn't mean that I saw.

1766
01:34:54.654 --> 01:34:57.692
[panelists speaking
simultaneously]

1767
01:35:00.695 --> 01:35:03.352
[ominous music]

1768
01:35:05.182 --> 01:35:07.011
- In your years of flying.

1769
01:35:07.046 --> 01:35:07.805
- Oh.
- As you said.

1770
01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:08.772
you've seen strange things.

1771
01:35:08.806 --> 01:35:12.120
- Well. yeah. I was flying
a T33. I guess

1772
01:35:12.154 --> 01:35:14.985
and I looked out and saw
a star out there.

1773
01:35:15.917 --> 01:35:17.712
but it wasn't a star.
it was Venus.

1774
01:35:17.746 --> 01:35:19.541
But it kept following me
all along.

1775
01:35:19.575 --> 01:35:23.614
And you would swear that
it's another object out there

1776
01:35:23.648 --> 01:35:24.649
and you can turn.

1777
01:35:24.684 --> 01:35:27.791
And I wanna congratulate
you on your magic show

1778
01:35:27.825 --> 01:35:29.689
last night with all
the illusions.

1779
01:35:29.724 --> 01:35:33.451
because now we're getting a
lot more illusions tonight.

1780
01:35:33.486 --> 01:35:36.006
And can you explain
everything that happened

1781
01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:38.698
with Chris Angel last night?
- I cannot explain anything.

1782
01:35:38.733 --> 01:35:39.734
- No. you can't.

1783
01:35:39.768 --> 01:35:40.873
- Doesn't make it.

1784
01:35:40.907 --> 01:35:41.977
- [Buzz Aldrin] That's right.

1785
01:35:42.012 --> 01:35:42.875
- Here's what I'm gonna do. folk

1786
01:35:44.083 --> 01:35:44.877
I'm gonna take a break. come
back and get the thought.

1787
01:35:44.911 --> 01:35:46.119
- One of my biggest regrets was

1788
01:35:46.154 --> 01:35:48.294
I didn't get Fay Ann Potter
on camera to.

1789
01:35:48.328 --> 01:35:50.745
I never thought she would
just die so quickly.

1790
01:35:50.779 --> 01:35:52.712
I didn't even know she was sick.
you know?

1791
01:35:52.954 --> 01:35:55.370
But Fay Ann Potter told me

1792
01:35:55.404 --> 01:35:58.269
that he had a very dramatic
encounter with a flying saucer

1793
01:35:58.304 --> 01:35:59.615
while he chased the disc.

1794
01:35:59.650 --> 01:36:01.583
'cause it is what she said.

1795
01:36:01.617 --> 01:36:03.274
While piloting in a fighter jet.

1796
01:36:03.309 --> 01:36:07.382
And that they were
followed by something

1797
01:36:07.416 --> 01:36:09.833
that they were not able
to explain to the Moon.

1798
01:36:09.867 --> 01:36:11.800
She did not say he had
a sighting on the Moon.

1799
01:36:11.835 --> 01:36:12.836
She didn't tell me that.

1800
01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:14.147
She said on the way to the Moon.

1801
01:36:14.182 --> 01:36:15.010
- Right.

1802
01:36:15.045 --> 01:36:16.046
- Now. what happened
on the Moon?

1803
01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:17.979
I have no idea. but
that's what she told me.

1804
01:36:18.013 --> 01:36:20.636
- Apollo 11 was purely symbolic.

1805
01:36:20.671 --> 01:36:23.950
It was land on the Moon
in the middle of nowhere.

1806
01:36:23.985 --> 01:36:26.435
avoid all this stuff that
we're concerned about.

1807
01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:28.541
because there's a whole theory.

1808
01:36:33.201 --> 01:36:34.823
That we can land on the Moon.

1809
01:36:34.858 --> 01:36:36.652
and it was out in the
middle of nowhere

1810
01:36:36.687 --> 01:36:37.895
and it was where the stars

1811
01:36:37.930 --> 01:36:40.277
were aligned properly in
the Sea of Tranquility

1812
01:36:40.311 --> 01:36:42.831
for Buzz Aldrin to perform
his ceremony.

1813
01:36:42.866 --> 01:36:45.661
which consecrated the Moon
itself as a Masonic temple.

1814
01:36:45.696 --> 01:36:48.078
and Apollo 11 tranquility
base as a Masonic temple.

1815
01:36:48.112 --> 01:36:49.217
That was the purpose.

1816
01:36:49.251 --> 01:36:51.978
All the other missions
were salvage missions.

1817
01:36:52.013 --> 01:36:56.051
Let's go land where we
think interesting stuff is.

1818
01:36:56.086 --> 01:36:57.915
ancient alien technology.

1819
01:36:57.950 --> 01:37:00.815
call it an anarchy
technology if you want to.

1820
01:37:00.849 --> 01:37:02.955
Left behind and bring it back

1821
01:37:02.989 --> 01:37:06.682
and do a Terminator to reverse
engineering type thing.

1822
01:37:06.717 --> 01:37:07.994
And I mean. it's pretty clear

1823
01:37:08.029 --> 01:37:10.203
as you look at the
photographic record.

1824
01:37:10.238 --> 01:37:11.170
Oh. did they see that?

1825
01:37:11.204 --> 01:37:12.102
Yeah. I'm sure they saw that.

1826
01:37:12.136 --> 01:37:12.930
Did they see this?

1827
01:37:12.965 --> 01:37:13.897
Yeah. I'm sure they saw that.

1828
01:37:13.931 --> 01:37:16.002
I'm sure they realized
that's not a rock.

1829
01:37:16.037 --> 01:37:19.143
because they were very well
trained in all this stuff.

1830
01:37:19.178 --> 01:37:21.766
[upbeat music]

1831
01:37:24.390 --> 01:37:25.356
- Welcome to Tucker Carlson.

1832
01:37:25.391 --> 01:37:27.393
Today. the crazy thing
about the topic of UFOs

1833
01:37:27.427 --> 01:37:30.775
is how when you get into
it. how really non-crazy.

1834
01:37:30.810 --> 01:37:32.467
a lot of the people
who know a lot

1835
01:37:32.501 --> 01:37:35.056
about the topic turn out to be.

1836
01:37:35.090 --> 01:37:37.713
They're kind of the opposite
of what you imagine.

1837
01:37:37.748 --> 01:37:39.474
They're not for conspiracy nuts.

1838
01:37:39.508 --> 01:37:42.442
A lot of them are
just scientists.

1839
01:37:42.477 --> 01:37:44.582
Garry Nolan is definitely
at the top of that list.

1840
01:37:44.617 --> 01:37:46.964
He's a Harvard. he's a
Stanford rather. professor.

1841
01:37:46.999 --> 01:37:49.346
Stanford PhD. an immunologist.

1842
01:37:49.380 --> 01:37:53.177
And he has over the
last decade or two.

1843
01:37:53.212 --> 01:37:56.663
spent a lot of time
studying the harmful effects

1844
01:37:56.698 --> 01:38:00.909
that apparent encounters with
UFOs have on the human brain.

1845
01:38:00.944 --> 01:38:04.464
- So my main job.
my day job at Stanford

1846
01:38:04.499 --> 01:38:08.089
for the last 30 years has been

1847
01:38:08.123 --> 01:38:10.781
the development of
technologies to look at cancer.

1848
01:38:10.815 --> 01:38:15.820
It was circa 2011 or so when
some people from the CIA

1849
01:38:18.064 --> 01:38:20.618
and an aerospace company
came to me

1850
01:38:20.653 --> 01:38:24.899
to ask me for their
help on the analysis

1851
01:38:24.933 --> 01:38:27.832
of some individuals
who had been.

1852
01:38:27.867 --> 01:38:31.181
had encountered some
anomalous objects they said.

1853
01:38:31.215 --> 01:38:35.461
And I mean they came to
my office unannounced

1854
01:38:35.495 --> 01:38:37.325
and then started laying
out pictures

1855
01:38:37.359 --> 01:38:40.535
and data on the table
in front of me.

1856
01:38:40.569 --> 01:38:43.331
Then that's a huge
operation in the government

1857
01:38:43.365 --> 01:38:44.297
to deal with those.

1858
01:38:44.332 --> 01:38:46.058
In fact. the Senate Intelligence
Committee

1859
01:38:46.092 --> 01:38:48.094
just came out with a
report this morning

1860
01:38:48.129 --> 01:38:49.820
that has language
specifically in it

1861
01:38:49.854 --> 01:38:52.512
to look at the Havana
Syndrome cases

1862
01:38:52.547 --> 01:38:53.824
and to understand it.

1863
01:38:54.790 --> 01:38:56.723
Also has interesting. I
don't know if you saw it.

1864
01:38:56.758 --> 01:38:58.967
it also has language about UAPs.

1865
01:38:59.002 --> 01:39:03.040
And basically. admonishing
the defense department saying.

1866
01:39:03.075 --> 01:39:05.042
you guys have been
dragging your feet.

1867
01:39:05.077 --> 01:39:08.494
No. no more. whistleblower
language.

1868
01:39:08.528 --> 01:39:10.392
They actually. there was
also a situation

1869
01:39:10.427 --> 01:39:13.844
where they wanna go all
the way back to 1947.

1870
01:39:13.878 --> 01:39:15.708
collect. they want the.

1871
01:39:15.742 --> 01:39:18.021
all the Defense Department
and the CIA. et cetera

1872
01:39:18.055 --> 01:39:20.230
to collect all the information

1873
01:39:20.264 --> 01:39:23.647
around events that
have occurred.

1874
01:39:23.681 --> 01:39:25.338
They want all of. interestingly.

1875
01:39:25.373 --> 01:39:28.376
the NDAs. the non-disclosure
agreements.

1876
01:39:28.410 --> 01:39:29.618
they want those all listed.

1877
01:39:29.653 --> 01:39:32.483
because the NDAs are
associated to people.

1878
01:39:32.518 --> 01:39:33.588
And that means they can start

1879
01:39:33.622 --> 01:39:35.797
to name the people who
have been involved.

1880
01:39:35.831 --> 01:39:38.834
They want all of the information
on the disinformation

1881
01:39:38.869 --> 01:39:41.458
and the obfuscation that's
been going on.

1882
01:39:41.492 --> 01:39:43.218
And they want information about

1883
01:39:43.253 --> 01:39:45.876
the medical harms
that have occurred.

1884
01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:48.396
- If we look at this
Tucker Carlson interview

1885
01:39:48.430 --> 01:39:52.055
that happened with the
Stanford University professor.

1886
01:39:52.089 --> 01:39:56.473
it gives one hope about the
disclosure and this movement

1887
01:39:56.507 --> 01:39:59.062
in which we might get
in the mainstream media.

1888
01:39:59.096 --> 01:40:02.651
The fact that we're not
alone sometime in the future.

1889
01:40:02.686 --> 01:40:06.172
These congressional hearings
in which experiencers

1890
01:40:06.207 --> 01:40:10.038
are going to testify
before Congress.

1891
01:40:10.073 --> 01:40:14.594
Experiencers being people
that were witness to UFOs

1892
01:40:14.629 --> 01:40:17.114
and actually were
physically affected

1893
01:40:17.149 --> 01:40:19.737
by their proximity to
these UFOs.

1894
01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:23.362
Now. these experiencers
are important.

1895
01:40:23.396 --> 01:40:25.295
but it pains me to think that

1896
01:40:26.675 --> 01:40:30.300
important whistleblowers
like Karl Wolfe

1897
01:40:31.853 --> 01:40:35.477
are no longer around
to also take part

1898
01:40:35.512 --> 01:40:37.893
in these congressional hearings.

1899
01:40:37.928 --> 01:40:41.104
Karl Wolfe passed away in 2018.

1900
01:40:42.415 --> 01:40:45.246
Just like John Mack was
hit by a car.

1901
01:40:46.143 --> 01:40:48.421
and this tragically
ended his life.

1902
01:40:49.284 --> 01:40:53.392
In 2018. Karl Wolfe was
also hit by a car

1903
01:40:53.426 --> 01:40:55.670
when he was on his bike.

1904
01:40:55.704 --> 01:40:59.915
And this is a very
unfortunate loss.

1905
01:40:59.950 --> 01:41:02.159
His family mourns his loss.

1906
01:41:02.194 --> 01:41:05.956
as does the
UFO research community.

1907
01:41:05.990 --> 01:41:09.270
- Well. let's say we know
all of these implications.

1908
01:41:09.304 --> 01:41:14.033
and let's say it's 1960

1909
01:41:14.068 --> 01:41:18.106
and we know some of
these things. right?

1910
01:41:18.141 --> 01:41:19.935
Well. you think of the
world back then.

1911
01:41:19.970 --> 01:41:21.627
The world of 1960.

1912
01:41:21.661 --> 01:41:25.631
no way would that world be ready

1913
01:41:25.665 --> 01:41:28.772
for some of the
intellectual realities

1914
01:41:28.806 --> 01:41:30.601
of what we think we know now.

1915
01:41:30.636 --> 01:41:32.638
Because actually our
knowledge of this subject

1916
01:41:32.672 --> 01:41:37.643
has gone way deeper in our era
than it ever was in the past.

1917
01:41:38.299 --> 01:41:40.370
In the past.
they're thinking like

1918
01:41:40.404 --> 01:41:41.992
the day the Earth stood still.

1919
01:41:42.026 --> 01:41:45.720
you know. men. maybe
some women in space suits

1920
01:41:45.754 --> 01:41:49.344
from another world in
their metal spaceships

1921
01:41:49.379 --> 01:41:50.897
have just arrived.

1922
01:41:50.932 --> 01:41:52.968
And you know. that whole thing.

1923
01:41:53.003 --> 01:41:55.178
And that's how people were
talking back in the fifties.

1924
01:41:55.212 --> 01:41:56.455
That's what they thought.

1925
01:41:56.489 --> 01:41:58.181
Or at least some of them were
thinking along these lines.

1926
01:41:58.215 --> 01:42:03.186
And that's clearly not
like we're well past that.

1927
01:42:03.910 --> 01:42:05.360
whatever the reality of this is.

1928
01:42:05.395 --> 01:42:09.571
this phenomenon signifies a
reality that is mind bending.

1929
01:42:10.814 --> 01:42:12.436
That we're gonna have to
make some adjustments.

1930
01:42:12.471 --> 01:42:17.165
So let's say back in 1960.
we've got some inkling of this.

1931
01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:18.960
And we have to ask ourselves.

1932
01:42:18.994 --> 01:42:21.859
what the hell do we do
with this information?

1933
01:42:21.894 --> 01:42:26.899
And how could we ever get the
public up to speed on this?

1934
01:42:28.142 --> 01:42:30.385
And if we were to really
think seriously about that.

1935
01:42:30.420 --> 01:42:35.114
we would realize this
will take generations.

1936
01:42:35.149 --> 01:42:36.529
This cannot happen right away.

1937
01:42:36.564 --> 01:42:38.013
There's no way.

1938
01:42:38.048 --> 01:42:39.222
No way.

1939
01:42:39.256 --> 01:42:42.190
- I don't think it's gonna
come as a surprise to folks

1940
01:42:42.225 --> 01:42:44.882
that have been following
us on this journey

1941
01:42:44.917 --> 01:42:49.784
that Apollo 12 has many of
the examples of anomalies.

1942
01:42:49.818 --> 01:42:53.305
structures on the Moon and UFOs

1943
01:42:53.339 --> 01:42:56.480
that we will also see
in later Moon missions.

1944
01:42:57.585 --> 01:43:00.243
[ominous music]

1945
01:43:12.151 --> 01:43:14.912
[dramatic music]

1946
01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:24.715
[dramatic music continues]

1947
01:43:31.343 --> 01:43:34.932
[dramatic music continues]

1948
01:43:41.387 --> 01:43:44.977
[dramatic music continues]

1949
01:43:51.466 --> 01:43:55.090
[dramatic music continues]

1950
01:44:01.614 --> 01:44:05.204
[dramatic music continues]

1951
01:44:11.521 --> 01:44:15.145
[dramatic music continues]

1952
01:44:21.531 --> 01:44:25.155
[dramatic music continues]

1953
01:44:31.334 --> 01:44:34.923
[dramatic music continues]
