3
00:01:16.744 --> 00:01:18.346
- Sir.
- What is it. Patrick?

4
00:01:18.346 --> 00:01:19.447
- Dispatches.

5
00:01:24.452 --> 00:01:27.288
- Who else has seen this?

6
00:01:27.288 --> 00:01:28.122
- Nobody.

7
00:01:48.442 --> 00:01:50.478
Speak.

8
00:01:50.478 --> 00:01:53.514
- Captain. a word
from the North.

9
00:01:53.514 --> 00:01:54.982
Go on.

10
00:01:57.017 --> 00:01:58.586
- The natives ambushed
William and his men

11
00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:00.388
on their journey home.

12
00:02:03.257 --> 00:02:04.258
- The count?

13
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.695
- 17 dead.

14
00:02:10.898 --> 00:02:12.500
- I meant the pelt count.

15
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.401
Any losses?

16
00:02:16.804 --> 00:02:18.272
- The men were found
naked and scalped.

17
00:02:18.272 --> 00:02:21.275
And there were no
pelts left behind.

18
00:02:23.377 --> 00:02:25.313
- 17 men dead. you say?

19
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.282
- Yes. sir.

20
00:02:28.282 --> 00:02:30.251
When we found them. they were.

21
00:02:30.251 --> 00:02:33.387
animals had already begun
to pick at their flesh.

22
00:02:33.387 --> 00:02:34.222
- Savages.

23
00:02:36.957 --> 00:02:39.760
Very well. have the men
gather their carcasses

24
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.229
and return back to camp

25
00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:44.398
so they can give
them a proper burial.

26
00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:46.934
You're dismissed.

27
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.606
- Levi was with your son when...

28
00:02:59.847 --> 00:03:00.614
- Dead?

29
00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.284
- Missing.

30
00:03:14.328 --> 00:03:16.330
- Where did this happen?

31
00:03:18.165 --> 00:03:20.501
- At the foot of
the Buckskin Forest.

32
00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:24.071
I sent a scout team.
but with the rumors...

33
00:03:29.343 --> 00:03:33.146
- There is a man in camp
that cooks for the others.

34
00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:34.915
Wears a wolfskin cap.

35
00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:37.851
Do you know him?

36
00:03:37.851 --> 00:03:38.686
- Porter.

37
00:03:38.686 --> 00:03:40.153
Yes. sir.

38
00:03:40.153 --> 00:03:44.425
- You send word that I
wish to speak to him.

39
00:03:44.425 --> 00:03:45.326
- Yes. sir.

40
00:03:59.106 --> 00:04:00.974
- What's the news?

41
00:04:00.974 --> 00:04:03.844
- Take a small team
of men up North.

42
00:04:03.844 --> 00:04:05.946
Have them bring shovels.

43
00:04:05.946 --> 00:04:08.816
Dig a hole about a
hundred meters from town.

44
00:04:08.816 --> 00:04:12.920
When they're done. have
them show you where it is.

45
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.789
- Baiting fox for the winter?

46
00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:17.725
- Digging a mass grave.

47
00:04:38.078 --> 00:04:38.912
Porter.

48
00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:44.552
- What's the point of
being alone in a church.

49
00:04:44.552 --> 00:04:47.321
you can't be alone in church?

50
00:04:47.321 --> 00:04:48.556
- My apologies.

51
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.694
The captain would like
to speak with you.

52
00:04:53.694 --> 00:04:55.396
- I'll have a word
with my captain.

53
00:04:55.396 --> 00:04:58.298
after I'm done having
a word with my God.

54
00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:00.834
- I'm afraid your God can wait.

55
00:05:20.788 --> 00:05:22.356
- You can leave us.

56
00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:32.433
Sit?

57
00:05:40.774 --> 00:05:42.275
- You sent for me?

58
00:05:44.412 --> 00:05:48.248
- From what I'm told.
the men enjoy your food.

59
00:05:50.083 --> 00:05:53.721
- Well. I'm pleased to
hear you say that. Captain.

60
00:05:53.721 --> 00:05:57.391
- Tell me. how does a
trapper become a cook?

61
00:05:58.826 --> 00:06:01.429
- A plague that takes the
lives of both his children.

62
00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:05.833
And a vow to protect what
little family he got left.

63
00:06:07.267 --> 00:06:11.171
Then. the winters are less
harsh here in the fort.

64
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.178
- I take it that you've heard

65
00:06:18.178 --> 00:06:20.881
about the men coming
home from the North?

66
00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:24.051
- Yeah. I just prayed
for their souls.

67
00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:30.624
I heard about William.

68
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.794
My condolences.

69
00:06:36.296 --> 00:06:40.468
It's always difficult to
accept the loss of a son.

70
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.239
- My son ought to have
been a general by now.

71
00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:52.145
It's far more difficult to
accept failure than death.

72
00:06:53.981 --> 00:06:56.249
- Well he died with his men.

73
00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:58.586
There's honor in that.

74
00:06:58.586 --> 00:07:03.023
- Were you aware that my
grandson. Levi. was with him?

75
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.367
He's gone missing.

76
00:07:14.367 --> 00:07:16.870
And alive. dead. I don't know.

77
00:07:21.742 --> 00:07:23.911
- I'm sorry for your pain.

78
00:07:26.346 --> 00:07:29.917
Levi and my son were.
they were very close.

79
00:07:31.318 --> 00:07:34.822
- Josiah. You were always
loyal to the company.

80
00:07:37.891 --> 00:07:39.727
to the men. and to me.

81
00:07:45.198 --> 00:07:49.036
The others got used to
taking orders from you.

82
00:07:50.003 --> 00:07:52.673
You were as strong as they come.

83
00:07:54.708 --> 00:07:55.543
- Sir?

84
00:07:58.846 --> 00:08:00.714
- The Ree are ruthless.

85
00:08:01.782 --> 00:08:03.016
But when it comes to finding

86
00:08:03.016 --> 00:08:06.353
my grandson my own
resolve meets theirs.

87
00:08:08.388 --> 00:08:09.623
- Yeah.

88
00:08:09.623 --> 00:08:11.091
Perhaps you can
send a team of men

89
00:08:11.091 --> 00:08:12.660
up the north trails before
any winter snow blows

90
00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.094
in and covers up those tracks.

91
00:08:14.094 --> 00:08:16.997
- We are 17 men short
of what we were.

92
00:08:16.997 --> 00:08:18.799
Soon to be 18.

93
00:08:18.799 --> 00:08:21.301
Tell me. what men can I spare?

94
00:08:27.207 --> 00:08:30.644
- What is it that you
ask of me. Captain?

95
00:08:48.996 --> 00:08:50.664
- Your mind wanders.

96
00:08:54.768 --> 00:08:56.937
- I'm sorry.
- What is it?

97
00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:07.380
- I am to go up the
north trails tomorrow.

98
00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:10.083
- For what purpose?

99
00:09:11.151 --> 00:09:12.552
The captain's
grandson. Levi.

100
00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:14.688
has gone missing up there.

101
00:09:14.688 --> 00:09:16.256
- And he chose you?

102
00:09:17.691 --> 00:09:18.525
Why?

103
00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.797
- This is what he asks of me.

104
00:09:23.797 --> 00:09:25.999
- Why not one of the other men?

105
00:09:25.999 --> 00:09:27.034
Someone younger?

106
00:09:27.034 --> 00:09:29.837
Someone who traps for a living?

107
00:09:29.837 --> 00:09:33.874
- I'm going to need you to cook
for the men until I return.

108
00:09:33.874 --> 00:09:34.708
- Where?

109
00:09:37.811 --> 00:09:39.312
- Where what?

110
00:09:39.312 --> 00:09:41.048
- Where on the trail?

111
00:09:45.819 --> 00:09:47.387
The women here talk.

112
00:09:47.387 --> 00:09:49.156
I know those men were
ambushed at the foot

113
00:09:49.156 --> 00:09:50.557
of the Buckskin Woods.

114
00:09:50.557 --> 00:09:52.626
- They were looking
for a quicker way home.

115
00:09:52.626 --> 00:09:54.795
- A home they never arrived at.

116
00:09:54.795 --> 00:09:57.464
We both know that place is evil.

117
00:09:58.966 --> 00:10:02.035
At least see her before you go.

118
00:10:02.035 --> 00:10:03.370
Her fortune might persuade you

119
00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:06.874
to think twice about
the captain's orders.

120
00:10:44.111 --> 00:10:44.912
- Strong.

121
00:10:47.314 --> 00:10:48.115
Ashamed.

122
00:10:50.684 --> 00:10:51.651
- That was my past.

123
00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:53.821
I'm interested in my future.

124
00:10:55.322 --> 00:10:56.890
- Indeed.

125
00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:59.359
Many men are. but the truth...

126
00:11:01.328 --> 00:11:03.263
- There's a difference?

127
00:11:03.263 --> 00:11:04.564
- One cannot have a future

128
00:11:04.564 --> 00:11:07.400
without first
accepting the truth.

129
00:11:08.535 --> 00:11:10.704
They are one and the same.

130
00:11:40.067 --> 00:11:44.104
You will have a long
journey to a familiar place.

131
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.177
A place with a past
filled with agony.

132
00:11:53.446 --> 00:11:54.915
The same as yours.

133
00:12:00.087 --> 00:12:02.689
And there is death in the trees.

134
00:12:06.693 --> 00:12:08.261
Blood in the water.

135
00:12:10.864 --> 00:12:13.633
You will not
survive the journey.

136
00:12:15.702 --> 00:12:18.338
- You can see my death?

137
00:12:18.338 --> 00:12:22.642
You will not
survive the journey.

138
00:12:22.642 --> 00:12:25.545
- I've survived
those woods before.

139
00:12:29.149 --> 00:12:32.752
- Death never makes
the same mistake twice.

140
00:12:55.075 --> 00:12:56.543
- First things first.

141
00:12:56.543 --> 00:12:57.777
If the pelts are lost.

142
00:12:57.777 --> 00:12:59.179
I won't go up the
trails looking for them.

143
00:12:59.179 --> 00:13:01.181
The deal is for
Levi. and Levi alone.

144
00:13:01.181 --> 00:13:02.916
Anything else is going
to add a week or so

145
00:13:02.916 --> 00:13:05.385
to the trip and
that's with packmules.

146
00:13:05.385 --> 00:13:06.653
- Understood.

147
00:13:06.653 --> 00:13:08.688
- Second. I'm not
winding up scalped

148
00:13:08.688 --> 00:13:11.058
on the edge of the riverbank.

149
00:13:11.058 --> 00:13:12.725
If I spot even one
native tailing me.

150
00:13:12.725 --> 00:13:14.928
I turn and make
back for the fort.

151
00:13:14.928 --> 00:13:15.762
- Agreed.

152
00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:18.498
- There are no
posts that far over

153
00:13:18.498 --> 00:13:20.367
so I'm going to be on foot.

154
00:13:20.367 --> 00:13:21.634
When I make it to
the woods I'm going

155
00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:23.436
to need both of my
hands free anyway.

156
00:13:23.436 --> 00:13:24.271
- All right.

157
00:13:24.271 --> 00:13:25.438
Anything else?

158
00:13:29.009 --> 00:13:31.912
- Is there some kind
of reward for this?

159
00:13:31.912 --> 00:13:33.346
I'd hate to leave my wife. Cora.

160
00:13:33.346 --> 00:13:36.183
in a bind if I wind
up lost or dead.

161
00:13:36.183 --> 00:13:37.184
There's $100 bonus

162
00:13:37.184 --> 00:13:40.053
from the Southwest Fur Company

163
00:13:40.053 --> 00:13:43.756
for the man that brings
my grandson home.

164
00:13:43.756 --> 00:13:46.226
I pray that that man is you.

165
00:14:03.977 --> 00:14:05.545
What news?

166
00:14:07.147 --> 00:14:11.618
- $100 bonus from the
Southwest Fur Company.

167
00:14:11.618 --> 00:14:13.253
- Not him.

168
00:14:13.253 --> 00:14:15.088
What was your fortune?

169
00:14:18.725 --> 00:14:21.361
- I didn't go see her.

170
00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:22.195
- Why not?

171
00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:28.301
- With the amount of
native blood I've spilled?

172
00:14:28.301 --> 00:14:30.938
- Saving that boy will
not bring ours back.

173
00:14:35.042 --> 00:14:36.876
- You'll be all right.

174
00:14:37.777 --> 00:14:39.947
Make sure you feed my men.

175
00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:55.996
Porter.

176
00:15:00.367 --> 00:15:01.634
- Henry.

177
00:15:01.634 --> 00:15:03.470
- You're leaving?

178
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:05.072
- Yep.

179
00:15:05.072 --> 00:15:08.808
I got to make the best
of whatever decent
light I have left.

180
00:15:08.808 --> 00:15:10.310
What is it. Henry?

181
00:15:12.179 --> 00:15:15.882
- It's just. how
is it that you run

182
00:15:15.882 --> 00:15:20.020
into the forest when
others run away from it?

183
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:27.127
- When my son passed.
Levi came by and visited.

184
00:15:28.795 --> 00:15:31.798
brought piles of
fresh cut dry wood.

185
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.735
Nobody asked him to do it.

186
00:15:35.735 --> 00:15:38.405
Nobody told him. he just did it.

187
00:15:40.673 --> 00:15:41.574
- Godspeed.

188
00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:44.244
- All right.

189
00:15:44.244 --> 00:15:45.078
Henry?

190
00:15:46.746 --> 00:15:50.417
Would you look after
my wife until I return?

191
00:16:02.329 --> 00:16:03.830
Captain.

192
00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:10.970
- Leave us. Henry.

193
00:16:19.712 --> 00:16:21.648
- You sent word for me?

194
00:16:23.616 --> 00:16:25.552
- Captain.
- Excuse me?

195
00:16:27.787 --> 00:16:30.657
- You sent word for me. Captain.

196
00:16:30.657 --> 00:16:32.859
When you're in this
house you will address me

197
00:16:32.859 --> 00:16:35.662
by my proper name and my rank.

198
00:16:35.662 --> 00:16:38.265
I am positive that
I have earned it.

199
00:16:38.265 --> 00:16:39.099
Sit.

200
00:16:42.102 --> 00:16:42.935
Sit down!

201
00:16:50.143 --> 00:16:53.480
So the cook came to
see you. did he not?

202
00:16:55.782 --> 00:16:57.950
You may speak freely here.

203
00:16:59.386 --> 00:17:00.187
- Yes.

204
00:17:01.388 --> 00:17:02.222
- Captain!

205
00:17:05.258 --> 00:17:07.827
Yes. Captain.

206
00:17:07.827 --> 00:17:10.597
- And you told
him of his future?

207
00:17:11.798 --> 00:17:12.632
- Yes.

208
00:17:16.169 --> 00:17:17.003
Captain.

209
00:17:18.938 --> 00:17:22.709
- And what did you tell
him about his future?

210
00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:27.947
- I told him the truth.

211
00:17:29.616 --> 00:17:31.384
Which is?

212
00:17:33.253 --> 00:17:37.424
- I told him he would not
return from his journey.

213
00:17:44.964 --> 00:17:48.301
- Tell me. witch.
your father was Pawnee

214
00:17:49.536 --> 00:17:51.804
and your mother was white.

215
00:17:51.804 --> 00:17:54.807
How does one come
to do what you do?

216
00:17:56.243 --> 00:17:58.911
- Before my father was murdered.

217
00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.216
he taught me the Pawnee rituals.

218
00:18:04.617 --> 00:18:08.421
Many of which allow me
to see into one's future.

219
00:18:09.889 --> 00:18:10.957
- The future?

220
00:18:14.961 --> 00:18:17.964
- Excuse me. but I
do not understand

221
00:18:19.065 --> 00:18:21.634
what you want from me. Captain.

222
00:18:29.976 --> 00:18:34.314
- I want you to tell me
what happens to my grandson.

223
00:19:02.742 --> 00:19:04.977
- Why are you following me?

224
00:19:19.726 --> 00:19:20.560
Hello.

225
00:19:23.596 --> 00:19:24.531
- Howdy.

226
00:19:24.531 --> 00:19:27.267
I didn't mean to frighten you.

227
00:19:27.267 --> 00:19:29.202
- Do I look frightened?

228
00:19:29.202 --> 00:19:30.036
- No.

229
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:32.038
No. you don't.

230
00:19:33.973 --> 00:19:38.411
Well actually I was just hoping
maybe I could come with you.

231
00:19:38.411 --> 00:19:39.812
- No.

232
00:19:39.812 --> 00:19:41.047
My journey is dangerous

233
00:19:41.047 --> 00:19:43.650
and you being the way you are.

234
00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:45.685
you're just going
to slow me down.

235
00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:48.221
You should make back for
the fort before night falls.

236
00:19:48.221 --> 00:19:50.957
- Well why is it I
can't be a trapper?

237
00:19:50.957 --> 00:19:52.925
- You're weak.

238
00:19:52.925 --> 00:19:55.395
I've seen animals
larger than you kill

239
00:19:55.395 --> 00:19:59.699
and eat other animals that
are also larger than you.

240
00:20:01.133 --> 00:20:02.702
- I have other skills.

241
00:20:02.702 --> 00:20:03.536
- Skills?

242
00:20:04.371 --> 00:20:05.204
Such as?

243
00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:06.539
- I can trap.

244
00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:08.341
Small animals.

245
00:20:08.341 --> 00:20:09.509
I can build fires.

246
00:20:09.509 --> 00:20:11.210
- I don't need a cook.

247
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.480
- I can gather wood.

248
00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:14.314
Kindling.

249
00:20:15.448 --> 00:20:17.149
- I can manage myself.

250
00:20:17.149 --> 00:20:18.551
The answer is no.

251
00:20:36.669 --> 00:20:38.204
- I can't go back this soon.

252
00:20:38.204 --> 00:20:40.707
The men at camp
don't respect me.

253
00:20:40.707 --> 00:20:42.375
Okay?

254
00:20:42.375 --> 00:20:44.844
They just make jokes about me.

255
00:20:48.114 --> 00:20:52.752
They said I wouldn't survive
the night out on the trail.

256
00:20:59.292 --> 00:21:02.228
- I've seen many men
stronger than you go out

257
00:21:02.228 --> 00:21:04.697
and brave that trail and die.

258
00:21:04.697 --> 00:21:06.265
Or wind up missing.

259
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:08.935
- Not you.

260
00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:14.541
And you could teach me
the art of survival.

261
00:21:22.248 --> 00:21:23.816
- What's your name?

262
00:21:26.152 --> 00:21:26.986
- Myles.

263
00:21:28.955 --> 00:21:32.359
- Well. Myles. why don't
you gather some wood

264
00:21:32.359 --> 00:21:33.593
and make us a fire.

265
00:21:33.593 --> 00:21:35.127
We'll make camp here tonight.

266
00:21:35.127 --> 00:21:37.196
But you'll head back to
the fort in the morning.

267
00:21:37.196 --> 00:21:38.130
All right?

268
00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.333
Tell the men I demanded it.

269
00:21:40.333 --> 00:21:45.004
Tell them. tell them that you
saved me from a wild boar.

270
00:21:46.739 --> 00:21:50.877
And when I return I will
tell them it's the truth.

271
00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:52.612
- Really?

272
00:21:55.247 --> 00:21:56.383
You'd do that?

273
00:21:57.249 --> 00:21:58.050
For me?

274
00:21:59.352 --> 00:22:00.319
Why?

275
00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:01.053
- Go on.

276
00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:04.824
- Yes. sir.

277
00:22:21.941 --> 00:22:23.676
So. I did good. yeah?

278
00:22:26.713 --> 00:22:27.547
- Yep.

279
00:22:28.748 --> 00:22:31.551
You keep the flames low
or surrounded with rock.

280
00:22:31.551 --> 00:22:36.556
That will keep the wolves at
bay if they don't see the fire.

281
00:22:37.156 --> 00:22:37.990
Here.

282
00:22:45.998 --> 00:22:49.268
Step one to surviving the trail.

283
00:22:49.268 --> 00:22:52.739
eat your meat without
looking at it first.

284
00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:02.014
So. who is she?

285
00:23:06.719 --> 00:23:07.554
- Huh?

286
00:23:08.755 --> 00:23:11.458
- The girl you're
trying to impress.

287
00:23:14.627 --> 00:23:17.063
- I wish it were that simple.

288
00:23:18.898 --> 00:23:23.736
So you're going after the
captain's grandson. yeah?

289
00:23:23.736 --> 00:23:25.738
That's right.

290
00:23:27.206 --> 00:23:31.410
I heard he might
be hiding in the Buckskin.

291
00:23:37.316 --> 00:23:40.987
- Do you find it hard
being the way you are?

292
00:23:43.856 --> 00:23:44.857
- Sometimes.

293
00:23:48.861 --> 00:23:51.531
Sometimes you can't do what
other young men can do.

294
00:23:51.531 --> 00:23:52.364
but I

295
00:23:56.168 --> 00:23:57.236
find purpose.

296
00:23:58.471 --> 00:23:59.271
- Purpose?

297
00:24:00.973 --> 00:24:02.041
What purpose?

298
00:24:07.346 --> 00:24:10.917
- It's not something easy
for a trapper to understand.

299
00:24:10.917 --> 00:24:13.152
- Well I'm not a
trapper anymore.

300
00:24:13.152 --> 00:24:14.153
Just a cook.

301
00:24:15.221 --> 00:24:16.055
- Yeah.

302
00:24:18.257 --> 00:24:22.261
Our scars only remind us
that the past was real.

303
00:24:28.968 --> 00:24:33.873
Before I came to Kingston. my
brothers and I lived upriver.

304
00:24:36.576 --> 00:24:39.411
One night the
Arikara came through.

305
00:24:39.411 --> 00:24:42.749
Must have been 10 of
them. on horseback.

306
00:24:44.283 --> 00:24:47.119
I offered them my
pelts. you know.

307
00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:54.694
But the Ree wanted something
else. I don't know.

308
00:25:04.203 --> 00:25:07.406
They held each of
us to the flame.

309
00:25:07.406 --> 00:25:08.340
One by one.

310
00:25:12.344 --> 00:25:15.615
The thing I remember
most is the smell.

311
00:25:16.683 --> 00:25:17.850
Burning flesh.

312
00:25:24.056 --> 00:25:26.392
Sometimes when I'm asleep...

313
00:25:31.097 --> 00:25:36.102
Do you ever wake up because
you feel like you're falling?

314
00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.274
Yeah.

315
00:25:46.278 --> 00:25:50.549
Sometimes I wake up feeling
like my skin's on fire.

316
00:25:56.455 --> 00:25:59.826
So I try to concentrate
on the things I can do

317
00:25:59.826 --> 00:26:02.528
rather than the
other way around.

318
00:26:07.499 --> 00:26:12.471
- And yet here you are
pretending to come along with me

319
00:26:12.471 --> 00:26:17.343
and win the favor of the other
trappers back at the fort.

320
00:26:19.812 --> 00:26:21.413
- Well. I am human.

321
00:26:22.782 --> 00:26:23.816
Yeah.

322
00:26:23.816 --> 00:26:26.085
- Myles. do you drink?
- Drink?

323
00:26:26.085 --> 00:26:29.088
- Yeah. do you want a drink?

324
00:26:30.589 --> 00:26:31.423
Here.

325
00:27:10.196 --> 00:27:11.864
- We've got company.

326
00:27:22.775 --> 00:27:23.776
- Gentlemen.

327
00:27:26.045 --> 00:27:29.515
- I heard about your
little hunt last night.

328
00:27:33.185 --> 00:27:35.955
- There is a white man
that hides in our trees.

329
00:27:35.955 --> 00:27:37.189
- On the trail?

330
00:27:40.026 --> 00:27:44.130
- We don't want his
stench covering our land.

331
00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:45.765
- Your land?

332
00:27:45.765 --> 00:27:46.598
All right.

333
00:27:47.734 --> 00:27:50.536
I guess we can call
it that for now.

334
00:27:55.341 --> 00:27:56.508
- What's this?

335
00:28:03.816 --> 00:28:07.153
- For the scalp of
the man in the woods.

336
00:28:12.558 --> 00:28:13.392
- Savages.

337
00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:16.362
- Business is business.

338
00:30:03.535 --> 00:30:04.971
- Drop the blade!

339
00:30:06.839 --> 00:30:09.008
- Drop the blade. trapper!

340
00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:12.644
All of it.

341
00:30:15.047 --> 00:30:17.649
Do you know where you're going?

342
00:30:17.649 --> 00:30:19.685
That there is the
Buckskin Woods.

343
00:30:19.685 --> 00:30:22.688
A man would be crazy
to go in there.

344
00:30:25.191 --> 00:30:27.793
- I'm here under Captain
Coleman's orders.

345
00:30:27.793 --> 00:30:28.627
- Who?

346
00:30:30.362 --> 00:30:32.664
- Captain Coleman.

347
00:30:32.664 --> 00:30:35.067
Of the Southwest Fur Company.

348
00:30:36.202 --> 00:30:39.771
That name
don't mean squat to me.

349
00:30:39.771 --> 00:30:41.908
- And who sent you?

350
00:30:41.908 --> 00:30:42.708
Akira?

351
00:30:43.642 --> 00:30:45.111
Or his dog Keokuk?

352
00:30:49.181 --> 00:30:52.251
I thought I smelled
cowards for hire.

353
00:30:53.152 --> 00:30:54.220
- Tie him up.

354
00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:15.674
Come on.

355
00:31:32.091 --> 00:31:32.925
- Water.

356
00:31:36.462 --> 00:31:37.296
Water.

357
00:31:39.298 --> 00:31:40.132
Water.

358
00:31:56.248 --> 00:31:59.218
- So how did you
know Akira sent us?

359
00:32:02.421 --> 00:32:06.658
- The man has been known to
strike deals with men like you.

360
00:32:06.658 --> 00:32:08.127
- Men like us?

361
00:32:08.127 --> 00:32:09.561
- Traitors.

362
00:32:09.561 --> 00:32:11.530
Woodsmen that travel
from fort to fort looking

363
00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:12.698
for easy coin.

364
00:32:16.502 --> 00:32:20.072
Whatever they promised
you. I'll double it.

365
00:32:22.408 --> 00:32:23.675
I'll triple it.

366
00:32:24.876 --> 00:32:26.478
Just get me inside
the Buckskin Woods

367
00:32:26.478 --> 00:32:28.814
and whenever I find
what I'm looking for.

368
00:32:28.814 --> 00:32:30.816
you follow me on
back to Fort Kingston

369
00:32:30.816 --> 00:32:32.918
and there you'll get paid
straight from the safe

370
00:32:32.918 --> 00:32:36.855
of Captain Coleman himself
and the Southwest Fur Company.

371
00:32:36.855 --> 00:32:37.789
- 10 coins?

372
00:32:39.158 --> 00:32:41.327
- Triple makes it 30.

373
00:32:41.327 --> 00:32:44.463
- What do we tell the
Indians about you?

374
00:32:44.463 --> 00:32:46.598
- Tell them you never found me.

375
00:32:46.598 --> 00:32:50.436
- They don't pay us to
come back empty handed.

376
00:32:52.404 --> 00:32:54.140
- This time they did.

377
00:33:00.912 --> 00:33:02.414
- All right.

378
00:33:02.414 --> 00:33:04.216
But first I want to know what
the hell you're doing going

379
00:33:04.216 --> 00:33:05.751
into them woods.

380
00:33:05.751 --> 00:33:08.020
- My business there is
none of your concern.

381
00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:09.888
- The hell it ain't.

382
00:33:09.888 --> 00:33:11.957
You know what people
say about those woods.

383
00:33:11.957 --> 00:33:15.694
What happens if a fellow travels
too deep into that brush.

384
00:33:15.694 --> 00:33:17.696
Do we got a deal or not?

385
00:33:18.564 --> 00:33:20.332
- I've got to piss.

386
00:33:20.332 --> 00:33:21.533
- Well hurry up.

387
00:33:21.533 --> 00:33:24.170
They're going to
be here any minute.

388
00:33:26.538 --> 00:33:29.608
Now what's to say we don't
go back to Fort Kingston

389
00:33:29.608 --> 00:33:32.544
and then you do a
dirty deal on us?

390
00:33:34.146 --> 00:33:36.648
- In my shooting bag
hanging from your saddle.

391
00:33:36.648 --> 00:33:39.218
there's a small book inside
with the terms written

392
00:33:39.218 --> 00:33:41.487
by Captain Coleman himself.

393
00:33:42.754 --> 00:33:43.589
Go on.

394
00:33:43.589 --> 00:33:44.423
Have a look.

395
00:33:44.423 --> 00:33:46.092
- All right. I will.

396
00:33:57.069 --> 00:34:00.206
There ain't no
Goddamned book in here.

397
00:34:31.637 --> 00:34:33.539
- If you're going
to call out to them.

398
00:34:33.539 --> 00:34:36.242
you're going to have
to yell real loud.

399
00:34:36.242 --> 00:34:37.075
- Ellis!

400
00:35:45.777 --> 00:35:46.612
- Knife.

401
00:35:52.384 --> 00:35:53.219
Knees.

402
00:36:06.131 --> 00:36:10.536
- When the blood in your
veins returns to the sea.

403
00:36:10.536 --> 00:36:14.139
and the earth in your bones
becomes one with the ground.

404
00:36:14.139 --> 00:36:16.642
perhaps then you will remember

405
00:36:18.477 --> 00:36:21.647
that this land does
not belong to you.

406
00:36:22.714 --> 00:36:25.551
It is you that
belongs to this land.

407
00:36:26.585 --> 00:36:27.919
- Tell me again.

408
00:36:34.125 --> 00:36:36.161
- The ground on which you
stand does not belong to you!

409
00:38:05.651 --> 00:38:06.485
- Captain.

410
00:38:07.586 --> 00:38:09.921
I think I see Porter coming.

411
00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:19.965
- Where are the others?

412
00:38:19.965 --> 00:38:21.667
Where are the pelts?

413
00:38:21.667 --> 00:38:23.569
I asked you a question.

414
00:38:28.239 --> 00:38:30.509
- The men are dead.

415
00:38:30.509 --> 00:38:34.480
And the pelts are floating
down the river as we speak.

416
00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:37.148
The Ree will have them
in a matter of hours.

417
00:38:37.148 --> 00:38:39.385
- Do you care to elaborate?

418
00:38:41.487 --> 00:38:43.822
- The Ree decimated the men.

419
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:48.660
The shoreline of the
river's been compromised.

420
00:38:50.962 --> 00:38:52.898
- You have to go back in there.

421
00:38:52.898 --> 00:38:55.133
I need those pelts.

422
00:38:55.133 --> 00:38:56.802
And that's an order.

423
00:38:57.803 --> 00:38:58.704
- An order?

424
00:39:03.375 --> 00:39:06.244
If you want those
God damned pelts.

425
00:39:06.244 --> 00:39:09.047
you can get them yourself.

426
00:39:09.047 --> 00:39:11.450
My wife sent word
for me weeks ago.

427
00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:12.651
and I intend to be home

428
00:39:12.651 --> 00:39:15.721
before the first
snow falls. Captain.

429
00:39:21.026 --> 00:39:24.095
- What about your
fellow company men?

430
00:39:27.899 --> 00:39:31.570
- I made sure they
received a proper burial.

431
00:39:36.341 --> 00:39:39.878
- The fever spread
through the camp.

432
00:39:39.878 --> 00:39:41.980
Your wife fell ill.

433
00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:45.584
The doctors say that
she'll survive though.

434
00:39:48.654 --> 00:39:50.556
- Is she alive?

435
00:39:50.556 --> 00:39:51.389
- Yeah.

436
00:39:55.927 --> 00:39:57.696
- What about my children?

437
00:40:10.275 --> 00:40:11.943
- I'm sorry. Porter.

438
00:40:22.454 --> 00:40:26.357
Wesley. do you understand
what I just told you?

439
00:40:28.226 --> 00:40:32.297
- Captain. you tell me I
no longer have children.

440
00:46:44.735 --> 00:46:46.171
- It's all there.

441
00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.542
I'm not a thief.

442
00:46:51.542 --> 00:46:52.377
- Levi?

443
00:46:53.945 --> 00:46:54.779
- You ate the berries.

444
00:46:54.779 --> 00:46:55.613
Yes?

445
00:46:57.382 --> 00:46:59.150
They're hallucinogens.

446
00:46:59.150 --> 00:47:01.386
The Ree lace their
arrowheads with them

447
00:47:01.386 --> 00:47:03.221
so you can't fight back
when they put the blade

448
00:47:03.221 --> 00:47:04.389
to your scalp.

449
00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:06.624
- My map.

450
00:47:07.792 --> 00:47:09.527
- Some men say it
can make it seem

451
00:47:09.527 --> 00:47:13.731
as if entire limbs just
vanish off your body.

452
00:47:13.731 --> 00:47:15.266
It numbs you.

453
00:47:15.266 --> 00:47:18.536
If the savages find you like
that. they scalp you first.

454
00:47:18.536 --> 00:47:20.038
Then they cut off your man parts

455
00:47:20.038 --> 00:47:23.942
and hang them around their
neck as a trophy prize.

456
00:47:28.046 --> 00:47:29.847
- Thank you.

457
00:47:29.847 --> 00:47:31.282
- You're welcome.

458
00:47:32.951 --> 00:47:34.285
Who sent you?

459
00:47:34.285 --> 00:47:36.221
- Your grandfather did.

460
00:47:38.556 --> 00:47:41.826
We should probably
start a course home.

461
00:47:43.594 --> 00:47:44.429
- Home?

462
00:47:45.863 --> 00:47:46.697
Yeah.

463
00:47:46.697 --> 00:47:47.532
Home.

464
00:47:47.532 --> 00:47:49.367
Back to Fort Kingston.

465
00:47:51.502 --> 00:47:53.571
Back to your grandfather.

466
00:47:54.772 --> 00:47:57.375
- I haven't seen another
white man in these woods

467
00:47:57.375 --> 00:47:58.709
since I arrived.

468
00:48:00.912 --> 00:48:05.917
- Levi. whatever happened to
you out here in these woods.

469
00:48:06.517 --> 00:48:07.518
we cannot stay.

470
00:48:07.518 --> 00:48:09.554
We must go home.

471
00:48:09.554 --> 00:48:11.222
- Do you remember...

472
00:48:16.627 --> 00:48:17.862
Home.

473
00:48:17.862 --> 00:48:18.696
Remember?

474
00:48:25.636 --> 00:48:27.872
- The savages have
the river high ground.

475
00:48:27.872 --> 00:48:29.774
The trees to the south.

476
00:48:33.144 --> 00:48:34.879
- I know there's another path.

477
00:48:34.879 --> 00:48:36.281
I've taken it.

478
00:48:36.281 --> 00:48:38.216
- East?
- That's right.

479
00:48:39.784 --> 00:48:41.686
Through the flats.

480
00:48:41.686 --> 00:48:43.188
- Out in the open?

481
00:48:44.089 --> 00:48:45.590
You dream. mister.

482
00:48:47.025 --> 00:48:49.995
- Levi. the longer we stay
here. the more we get lost.

483
00:48:49.995 --> 00:48:52.497
You must trust me.
it's just these woods-

484
00:48:52.497 --> 00:48:53.331
- Expand.

485
00:48:54.632 --> 00:48:55.633
Yes. I know.

486
00:48:56.934 --> 00:49:00.205
I spent a week
walking in a circle.

487
00:49:00.205 --> 00:49:02.140
For someone who's
been here before.

488
00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:03.608
you sure don't understand
the rules the natives

489
00:49:03.608 --> 00:49:05.276
have for this place.

490
00:49:06.344 --> 00:49:07.912
- I know the rules.

491
00:49:09.047 --> 00:49:12.984
- Once you're in.
there's no getting out.

492
00:49:12.984 --> 00:49:13.818
- No.

493
00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:16.421
- This is where you fell ill.

494
00:49:16.421 --> 00:49:18.856
And this is where we are now.

495
00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:21.592
- That cannot be.

496
00:49:21.592 --> 00:49:23.261
That's a day's walk at least.

497
00:49:23.261 --> 00:49:25.863
- Like I said. the woods expand.

498
00:49:25.863 --> 00:49:27.865
They pull you in deeper.

499
00:49:33.371 --> 00:49:36.874
Is that why you stayed
here all this time?

500
00:49:38.043 --> 00:49:40.278
- My grandfather
shouldn't have sent you.

501
00:49:40.278 --> 00:49:41.212
Sleep.

502
00:49:41.212 --> 00:49:43.548
We should move at the sun.

503
00:49:43.548 --> 00:49:45.116
The trees whisper to the Rees.

504
00:49:45.116 --> 00:49:47.185
They should be here soon.

505
00:50:19.050 --> 00:50:20.818
- Levi. we're going
the wrong way.

506
00:50:20.818 --> 00:50:22.687
- Remember what I said
about the high ground?

507
00:50:22.687 --> 00:50:25.223
How do you expect
to go east by traveling west?

508
00:50:25.223 --> 00:50:28.059
- Your compass is useless here.

509
00:50:28.059 --> 00:50:31.262
- The sun's light is my compass.

510
00:50:31.262 --> 00:50:34.565
The woods may play tricks.
but to my knowledge it

511
00:50:34.565 --> 00:50:37.302
cannot change the direction
of the sun's light.

512
00:50:37.302 --> 00:50:40.171
- I don't think you understand.

513
00:50:40.171 --> 00:50:42.373
- No. it's you're the one
who doesn't understand.

514
00:50:42.373 --> 00:50:44.842
Your grandfather hired me to
find you and bring you home.

515
00:50:44.842 --> 00:50:48.079
and that's exactly
what I intend to do.

516
00:50:50.948 --> 00:50:52.617
My map says east.

517
00:50:52.617 --> 00:50:53.418
Not west.

518
00:50:55.019 --> 00:50:56.154
- Who are you?

519
00:50:59.624 --> 00:51:02.960
- I'm the man sent
here to save your ass.

520
00:51:04.195 --> 00:51:06.197
- They slaughtered them.

521
00:51:07.632 --> 00:51:10.568
Even the men who surrendered.

522
00:51:10.568 --> 00:51:13.471
They lifted their hands but
they cut off their fingers.

523
00:51:13.471 --> 00:51:17.242
They begged for mercy. but
they cut out their tongues.

524
00:51:17.242 --> 00:51:18.676
They smiled as they did it.

525
00:51:18.676 --> 00:51:20.178
There was so much
blood it pooled

526
00:51:20.178 --> 00:51:21.846
in the dirt like rainwater.

527
00:51:21.846 --> 00:51:24.582
I watched as they
took my father.

528
00:51:28.486 --> 00:51:32.423
- And you got away?
- I ran into the woods.

529
00:51:32.423 --> 00:51:35.025
The last of the men to
be killed saw me run.

530
00:51:35.025 --> 00:51:38.563
I hid in the brush and watched
as they were disemboweled.

531
00:51:38.563 --> 00:51:39.930
I saw my father's eyes.

532
00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:40.865
I swear it.

533
00:51:44.235 --> 00:51:49.039
He'd rather be torn to pieces
than hide in these woods.

534
00:51:49.039 --> 00:51:50.741
- This place is evil.

535
00:51:52.777 --> 00:51:57.748
These woods don't care about
pelts. furs or your heart.

536
00:51:58.516 --> 00:52:00.351
It wants your soul.

537
00:52:00.351 --> 00:52:02.220
- How do you know this?

538
00:52:03.954 --> 00:52:06.624
- Because it tried to take mine.

539
00:52:09.394 --> 00:52:10.228
Don't move!

540
00:52:13.164 --> 00:52:15.200
I said don't move.

541
00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:16.434
- I can see over the ledge.

542
00:52:16.434 --> 00:52:17.602
I can make it.

543
00:52:29.647 --> 00:52:30.481
Ree.

544
00:52:30.481 --> 00:52:31.649
Maybe a dozen.

545
00:52:37.488 --> 00:52:40.858
- Tell me more about
this path west.

546
00:52:40.858 --> 00:52:42.293
- It's quiet.

547
00:52:42.293 --> 00:52:43.561
I've never seen more
than two or three scouts.

548
00:52:43.561 --> 00:52:46.464
But I'm poking my
head over ledges.

549
00:52:49.534 --> 00:52:52.069
- And this western trail.
it somehow winds around

550
00:52:52.069 --> 00:52:54.004
and goes east again?

551
00:52:54.004 --> 00:52:56.807
- If you're trusting
the sun. yes.

552
00:53:03.648 --> 00:53:04.482
- Show me.

553
00:53:20.498 --> 00:53:21.332
Slow down.

554
00:54:02.373 --> 00:54:03.441
- What is it?

555
00:54:05.576 --> 00:54:07.077
What does it mean?

556
00:54:10.748 --> 00:54:13.351
- You were being hunted.

557
00:54:13.351 --> 00:54:14.885
- How do you know it was for me?

558
00:54:14.885 --> 00:54:16.421
- Who else would it be for?

559
00:54:16.421 --> 00:54:18.523
You said there
were native scouts?

560
00:54:18.523 --> 00:54:20.425
- A few here and there.

561
00:54:21.392 --> 00:54:22.960
- And none of them saw you?

562
00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:24.662
- Not that I know of.

563
00:54:24.662 --> 00:54:26.297
- That's not a no.

564
00:54:26.297 --> 00:54:29.099
And you've taken this
trail west before?

565
00:54:29.099 --> 00:54:30.167
- Well. yeah.

566
00:54:31.969 --> 00:54:33.070
What's wrong?

567
00:54:34.705 --> 00:54:37.408
- You never take the
same trail twice.

568
00:54:37.408 --> 00:54:38.576
- You didn't ask that.

569
00:54:38.576 --> 00:54:40.478
You asked if the western
trail leads east.

570
00:54:40.478 --> 00:54:43.280
- Yes. but I thought you knew
the basic rules of trapping.

571
00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:45.750
Now you're sending us
all over these woods.

572
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:49.920
- Well we can't circle
back. so what do we do now?

573
00:54:51.456 --> 00:54:53.624
- We make camp for the night.

574
00:54:53.624 --> 00:54:55.159
We're going to lose light
soon and I don't want

575
00:54:55.159 --> 00:54:59.364
to be walking into a Ree
arrow again in the dark.

576
00:54:59.364 --> 00:55:00.164
Find wood.

577
00:55:01.466 --> 00:55:02.299
Go on now.

578
00:55:16.814 --> 00:55:18.716
- I'm starving.
- Yeah.

579
00:55:20.351 --> 00:55:23.421
I've never eaten an animal
this deep in the woods.

580
00:55:23.421 --> 00:55:24.254
- Why not?

581
00:55:25.856 --> 00:55:27.257
- It's forbidden.

582
00:55:29.059 --> 00:55:32.029
- How did you know what
those tree markings meant?

583
00:55:32.029 --> 00:55:34.999
- When I was littler
than you. my father used

584
00:55:34.999 --> 00:55:37.402
to take me up river. long trips.

585
00:55:37.402 --> 00:55:40.671
And I studied their
language to pass the time.

586
00:55:40.671 --> 00:55:42.673
- You were a trapper?

587
00:55:42.673 --> 00:55:46.310
- Alongside your grandfather.
if you can imagine that.

588
00:55:46.310 --> 00:55:49.880
That's why he
sent you to find me.

589
00:55:51.081 --> 00:55:53.250
- You knew my son. Josiah.

590
00:55:56.721 --> 00:55:59.323
You do remember my son. Josiah?

591
00:56:03.428 --> 00:56:05.195
- Of course.

592
00:56:05.195 --> 00:56:07.965
I was sad to hear
of his passing.

593
00:56:08.999 --> 00:56:10.000
- Yeah.

594
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.770
He was very fond of you.

595
00:56:12.770 --> 00:56:15.806
He aspired to be like
you and the older boys.

596
00:56:15.806 --> 00:56:18.676
Almost too much at times.

597
00:56:18.676 --> 00:56:23.681
- Earlier you said these
woods tried to take your soul.

598
00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:30.455
- Levi. why is it that you
never escaped these woods?

599
00:56:32.256 --> 00:56:34.959
- I tried to many times.

600
00:56:34.959 --> 00:56:36.326
- Confusion?

601
00:56:36.326 --> 00:56:37.428
Feeling lost?

602
00:56:39.129 --> 00:56:42.633
Yeah. these woods
intend to keep you here.

603
00:56:43.768 --> 00:56:46.370
Make you feel that way.

604
00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:48.172
They intend to keep your soul.

605
00:56:48.172 --> 00:56:49.006
Forever.

606
00:56:50.441 --> 00:56:52.577
- How do you know this?

607
00:56:52.577 --> 00:56:55.179
- Me and 12 men coming
up the Missouri.

608
00:56:55.179 --> 00:56:59.183
with a large haul
after a brutal winter.

609
00:56:59.183 --> 00:57:01.819
The Ree caught wind of us
somewhere between the riverbank

610
00:57:01.819 --> 00:57:03.621
and the north trail.

611
00:57:03.621 --> 00:57:05.122
And by the time we
saw them coming.

612
00:57:05.122 --> 00:57:07.458
half the men had arrows
sticking out their asses.

613
00:57:07.458 --> 00:57:10.561
and their eyeballs
and their throats.

614
00:57:10.561 --> 00:57:13.063
And I remember looking
up in the trees

615
00:57:13.063 --> 00:57:17.367
and wondering how the Ree
acquired such perfect aim.

616
00:57:17.367 --> 00:57:19.069
The few of us that
dodged their bows

617
00:57:19.069 --> 00:57:21.939
were chased down into the woods.

618
00:57:21.939 --> 00:57:22.940
These woods.

619
00:57:24.074 --> 00:57:25.543
And we didn't think
much of it at the time.

620
00:57:25.543 --> 00:57:29.714
but one by one these
woods drove us mad.

621
00:57:29.714 --> 00:57:31.381
Caused us to turn on each other.

622
00:57:31.381 --> 00:57:36.220
When it was all said and done
I was the last man standing.

623
00:57:38.489 --> 00:57:39.857
Late one night. the Ree came

624
00:57:39.857 --> 00:57:42.927
out of the treeline
riding horses.

625
00:57:42.927 --> 00:57:45.596
And I'd dug a foot deep
trench and laid down in it.

626
00:57:45.596 --> 00:57:48.065
Covered myself in dirt and
stayed there for God knows

627
00:57:48.065 --> 00:57:50.901
how long until the
next day's sun.

628
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:56.941
I was able to follow their
tracks out of the woods.

629
00:57:56.941 --> 00:58:01.879
And that's how I know these
woods don't want a man's pelt.

630
00:58:02.613 --> 00:58:04.048
they want a man's soul.

631
00:58:06.717 --> 00:58:08.185
- Did you make it home?

632
00:58:08.185 --> 00:58:10.187
- No.
- What did you do?

633
00:58:11.822 --> 00:58:12.657
- I hid.

634
00:58:13.858 --> 00:58:16.026
I watched the Ree closely.

635
00:58:17.427 --> 00:58:19.229
Whenever I could. I'd set
traps on the outskirts

636
00:58:19.229 --> 00:58:20.965
of these woods.

637
00:58:20.965 --> 00:58:22.800
It took me only three
days to round up

638
00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:25.202
that small group of Ree.

639
00:58:25.202 --> 00:58:26.571
The poor bastards were so eager

640
00:58:26.571 --> 00:58:28.773
to escape a few of
them tried sawing off

641
00:58:28.773 --> 00:58:32.076
their foot at the
ankle with sharp rocks.

642
00:58:32.076 --> 00:58:34.645
That's when I know it was time.

643
00:58:35.546 --> 00:58:37.214
- To watch them die?

644
00:58:38.849 --> 00:58:40.651
- I tried waiting them out.

645
00:58:40.651 --> 00:58:42.519
That was taking too long.

646
00:58:42.519 --> 00:58:44.188
So I took out my
tomahawk and began

647
00:58:44.188 --> 00:58:47.524
to hack them up just
as they did my men.

648
00:58:49.459 --> 00:58:50.561
Limb by limb.

649
00:58:52.529 --> 00:58:53.731
I gathered the body parts

650
00:58:53.731 --> 00:58:57.367
and buried them
here in these woods.

651
00:58:57.367 --> 00:59:00.537
This place became my own
personal burial ground

652
00:59:00.537 --> 00:59:04.008
for the mutilated
savages that I murdered.

653
00:59:07.411 --> 00:59:10.080
And when I finally made it home.

654
00:59:11.548 --> 00:59:15.920
both of my children had
been taken by the plague.

655
00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:18.022
My wife nearly
succumbed by the fever.

656
00:59:18.022 --> 00:59:21.291
And I swore I'd never
leave home again.

657
00:59:22.627 --> 00:59:25.529
I went to go see
the fortune teller.

658
00:59:25.529 --> 00:59:28.032
and she told me that the woods

659
00:59:29.333 --> 00:59:32.002
had sent a watcher home with me.

660
00:59:33.503 --> 00:59:35.973
And that one day he
would lead me back here

661
00:59:35.973 --> 00:59:37.474
to face my demise.

662
00:59:39.744 --> 00:59:40.745
Here we are.

663
00:59:42.446 --> 00:59:44.014
The Buckskin Woods.

664
00:59:46.116 --> 00:59:48.986
- Then why did you
agree to come back?

665
00:59:48.986 --> 00:59:52.790
- Because your grandfather
asked me to do so.

666
00:59:55.559 --> 00:59:56.994
- What was that?

667
00:59:56.994 --> 00:59:57.828
- Relax.

668
00:59:57.828 --> 00:59:59.229
- Can you see it?

669
01:00:00.497 --> 01:00:01.331
An Alpha.

670
01:00:02.767 --> 01:00:03.701
- An Omega.

671
01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:07.838
What was that?

672
01:00:07.838 --> 01:00:11.175
- That's the Alpha
putting down a challenge.

673
01:00:11.175 --> 01:00:12.509
- How do we know?

674
01:00:12.509 --> 01:00:13.911
How can we stay here?

675
01:00:13.911 --> 01:00:15.279
- And what would you have me do?

676
01:00:15.279 --> 01:00:17.882
Go chasing wolves in the dark?

677
01:00:17.882 --> 01:00:19.516
- The rifle.

678
01:00:19.516 --> 01:00:22.687
- Nobody touches
this rifle except me.

679
01:00:25.823 --> 01:00:27.224
- What are you doing?

680
01:00:28.058 --> 01:00:28.893
Stop that!

681
01:00:28.893 --> 01:00:29.727
Are you mad?

682
01:00:29.727 --> 01:00:31.662
What are you doing?

683
01:00:31.662 --> 01:00:32.863
- I'm being a wolf.

684
01:00:32.863 --> 01:00:34.098
Try it.

685
01:00:34.098 --> 01:00:35.900
Wolves aren't afraid
of other wolves.

686
01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:36.834
Go on.

687
01:00:36.834 --> 01:00:38.936
Let them know you're here.

688
01:00:43.173 --> 01:00:44.041
Yeah.

689
01:00:44.875 --> 01:00:45.843
Louder!

690
01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:49.479
See?

691
01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:50.314
How do you feel?

692
01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:51.515
Better?

693
01:00:51.515 --> 01:00:52.649
- Like a wolf.

694
01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:54.418
- Yeah.

695
01:00:54.418 --> 01:00:55.686
My son loved wolves.

696
01:00:55.686 --> 01:00:57.654
Always wanted to be one.

697
01:01:02.793 --> 01:01:03.728
Come on now.

698
01:01:03.728 --> 01:01:04.661
That sounds like a chicken.

699
01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:05.930
Let me hear a wolf!

700
01:01:21.211 --> 01:01:22.913
What direction is this?

701
01:01:22.913 --> 01:01:24.548
- West.

702
01:01:24.548 --> 01:01:25.916
East.

703
01:01:25.916 --> 01:01:27.084
West. I think.

704
01:01:28.252 --> 01:01:30.120
- What direction
does the sun set?

705
01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.588
- The west.

706
01:01:31.588 --> 01:01:34.024
- Then why are we headed north?

707
01:01:34.024 --> 01:01:34.859
- North?

708
01:01:36.827 --> 01:01:38.295
- Look.

709
01:01:38.295 --> 01:01:40.564
That there is the same
tree we passed yesterday.

710
01:01:40.564 --> 01:01:41.766
- Impossible.

711
01:01:41.766 --> 01:01:44.468
We've
circled back around!

712
01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:47.337
- Are you all right?

713
01:01:48.672 --> 01:01:51.441
- We've lost two days walking.

714
01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:54.644
Taking this western
trail of yours.

715
01:01:54.644 --> 01:01:55.479
- No.

716
01:01:55.479 --> 01:01:56.680
Not that.

717
01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:58.749
Your eyes. they're watering.

718
01:02:02.686 --> 01:02:03.520
- Strange.

719
01:02:07.457 --> 01:02:08.292
- Take it off!

720
01:02:08.292 --> 01:02:09.126
Your clothes.

721
01:02:09.126 --> 01:02:10.094
Remove all of it. now!

722
01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:17.134
- What is it?

723
01:02:19.469 --> 01:02:22.039
- Remember those berries
I told you about?

724
01:02:22.039 --> 01:02:23.573
Like I said. you've
been poisoned.

725
01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:24.408
- What?

726
01:02:24.408 --> 01:02:25.242
How?

727
01:02:25.242 --> 01:02:26.676
- I don't know.

728
01:02:26.676 --> 01:02:28.145
You must have brushed up
against a branch or something.

729
01:02:28.145 --> 01:02:29.713
- What's happening?

730
01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:31.916
I need to go get water.

731
01:02:31.916 --> 01:02:33.150
Stay here.

732
01:03:35.946 --> 01:03:36.780
Shhh.

733
01:03:38.715 --> 01:03:39.549
Ree.

734
01:03:40.918 --> 01:03:41.919
- How many?

735
01:03:41.919 --> 01:03:44.054
- Less than six.

736
01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:48.758
- We can't stay here.

737
01:03:48.758 --> 01:03:49.593
- Don't move.

738
01:03:49.593 --> 01:03:51.161
It's still healing.

739
01:03:55.765 --> 01:03:56.833
They're gone.

740
01:04:03.941 --> 01:04:04.841
- My rifle.

741
01:04:06.877 --> 01:04:08.212
Where is it?

742
01:04:08.212 --> 01:04:10.814
- I left it back near the trail.

743
01:04:10.814 --> 01:04:11.949
- You left it?

744
01:04:11.949 --> 01:04:13.083
Why?

745
01:04:13.083 --> 01:04:14.351
- You were burning up.

746
01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:16.954
I didn't have time
to return for it.

747
01:04:16.954 --> 01:04:20.024
Just where do you
think you're going?

748
01:04:22.126 --> 01:04:24.261
- I'm going to get my gun.

749
01:04:24.261 --> 01:04:25.362
The brush
is full of spies.

750
01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:27.297
You'll never make it.

751
01:04:27.297 --> 01:04:30.500
- Just how far do you think
we're going to get without it?

752
01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:33.337
- Your wound isn't fully healed.

753
01:04:33.337 --> 01:04:34.571
You're risking your life.

754
01:04:34.571 --> 01:04:35.405
Our lives.

755
01:04:37.807 --> 01:04:41.645
- If you don't want to
go. then you stay here.

756
01:05:04.834 --> 01:05:05.835
Where is it?

757
01:05:07.337 --> 01:05:09.139
- It was right
here when we left.

758
01:05:09.139 --> 01:05:10.607
- Without a rifle we
can't fight anyone off

759
01:05:10.607 --> 01:05:12.576
without getting close.

760
01:05:12.576 --> 01:05:13.877
- Maybe the Ree took it.

761
01:05:13.877 --> 01:05:15.545
They're tracking us-

762
01:05:17.714 --> 01:05:18.615
What is it?

763
01:05:29.126 --> 01:05:31.228
- How is it that I was stuck.

764
01:05:31.228 --> 01:05:34.664
yet none of my clothing
has been pierced?

765
01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:37.634
I asked you a question!

766
01:05:37.634 --> 01:05:40.370
How is it that I got stuck?

767
01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:41.605
- I don't know.

768
01:05:42.572 --> 01:05:43.773
- You don't know?

769
01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:45.275
Just like you don't
know where my rifle is?

770
01:05:45.275 --> 01:05:48.845
Just like this path west by
some magic leads east somehow?

771
01:05:48.845 --> 01:05:51.015
- I saved your life twice.

772
01:05:54.418 --> 01:05:55.585
- Look at you.

773
01:05:57.154 --> 01:06:00.024
I've been sent out here to
rescue the prodigal son.

774
01:06:00.024 --> 01:06:04.361
And all he has to say is
that he saved my life twice.

775
01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:06.630
- Where are you going?

776
01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:07.564
- Home.
- Home?

777
01:06:07.564 --> 01:06:08.398
Yes.

778
01:06:08.398 --> 01:06:09.666
Back to Fort Kingston.

779
01:06:09.666 --> 01:06:12.636
- We can still make
for home together.

780
01:06:12.636 --> 01:06:14.271
- You don't want to go home.

781
01:06:14.271 --> 01:06:15.739
You belong to these woods now.

782
01:06:15.739 --> 01:06:16.973
And ever since we've
started you been

783
01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:19.376
leading me around
in one giant circle.

784
01:06:19.376 --> 01:06:21.845
And I didn't come out here
against my wife's wishes

785
01:06:21.845 --> 01:06:23.480
to get lost and die at the hands

786
01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:25.915
of these savages for nothing.

787
01:06:32.622 --> 01:06:34.724
Well it looks like I did.

788
01:06:35.659 --> 01:06:38.428
- We're lost!
- You're lost.

789
01:07:29.413 --> 01:07:30.314
We made it.

790
01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:38.955
This is it.

791
01:07:43.193 --> 01:07:44.094
What is it?

792
01:07:47.197 --> 01:07:48.132
What is it?

793
01:07:50.967 --> 01:07:55.972
- I was the one who stuck you
in the woods. while you slept.

794
01:07:58.208 --> 01:08:00.177
I also buried the rifle.

795
01:08:02.746 --> 01:08:04.748
- Why would you do that?

796
01:08:04.748 --> 01:08:07.617
- Because they made me do it.

797
01:08:07.617 --> 01:08:08.452
- Who?

798
01:08:08.452 --> 01:08:09.253
The Ree?

799
01:08:12.722 --> 01:08:14.658
Who talks to you. Levi?

800
01:08:15.559 --> 01:08:16.960
- I cannot leave.

801
01:08:18.328 --> 01:08:22.999
- Levi. your father died
trying to escape these woods.

802
01:08:22.999 --> 01:08:24.434
- I cannot leave.

803
01:08:30.274 --> 01:08:33.710
- Levi. if you go back in
those woods you are never going

804
01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:35.945
to come out the same again.

805
01:08:37.281 --> 01:08:39.716
- Says the man that
made it out alive.

806
01:08:39.716 --> 01:08:40.550
- Yeah.

807
01:08:42.085 --> 01:08:43.587
But it changed me.

808
01:08:44.821 --> 01:08:46.423
Changed me from
the man I once was.

809
01:08:46.423 --> 01:08:49.493
and you don't want
that for yourself.

810
01:08:50.694 --> 01:08:51.995
Think of Josiah.

811
01:08:53.363 --> 01:08:56.099
I lost him because I
was here in these woods

812
01:08:56.099 --> 01:08:58.702
instead of at home next to him.

813
01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:03.407
I never got to hold
his hand as he passed.

814
01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:09.679
You don't remember him. do you?

815
01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:15.519
Then it's you that's lost.

816
01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:20.790
- If you'd stayed. he'd
still be alive today.

817
01:09:20.790 --> 01:09:24.294
You traded your life for
his. don't you see it?

818
01:09:24.294 --> 01:09:26.563
- I see. believe me. I see!

819
01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:32.802
- If you loved your son.

820
01:09:32.802 --> 01:09:35.805
you should have
stayed in the woods.

821
01:09:38.408 --> 01:09:41.077
- Levi. step out onto the trail.

822
01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:48.618
- You killed Josiah!

823
01:09:52.622 --> 01:09:53.890
- Levi. please.

824
01:09:56.025 --> 01:09:58.428
Just step out of those woods.

825
01:10:05.435 --> 01:10:06.703
- Stay with me.

826
01:10:08.738 --> 01:10:11.341
- You're not thinking straight.

827
01:10:12.542 --> 01:10:15.011
Levi. come out here
where I can see you

828
01:10:15.011 --> 01:10:18.081
and we can make a
path home together.

829
01:10:19.683 --> 01:10:20.517
Levi!

830
01:11:58.281 --> 01:12:00.216
- Stay with me.

831
01:12:00.216 --> 01:12:01.885
- No chance.

832
01:12:01.885 --> 01:12:03.920
You made your decision.

833
01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:05.455
I'll tell Captain
Coleman his grandson

834
01:12:05.455 --> 01:12:07.791
was dead when I arrived.

835
01:12:07.791 --> 01:12:09.626
- That would be a lie.

836
01:12:10.794 --> 01:12:11.695
- So be it.

837
01:12:13.129 --> 01:12:14.998
- You'll not
survive the journey!

838
01:12:14.998 --> 01:12:16.199
That's what the fortune teller

839
01:12:16.199 --> 01:12:19.068
told you before
you left. isn't it?

840
01:12:20.003 --> 01:12:22.138
- Goodbye. Levi.

841
01:12:22.138 --> 01:12:23.840
- Fucking coward!

842
01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:27.711
Last time you left these woods
your son and daughter died.

843
01:12:27.711 --> 01:12:29.646
Who's the only one left to take?

844
01:12:29.646 --> 01:12:31.114
Your wife?

845
01:12:31.114 --> 01:12:32.649
Cora?

846
01:12:32.649 --> 01:12:36.185
- That isn't you in
there. Levi. I know it.

847
01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:38.187
- There's a deal on the table.

848
01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:39.789
Your life for mine.

849
01:12:43.126 --> 01:12:44.861
- And you trust them?

850
01:12:45.929 --> 01:12:46.763
The Ree?

851
01:12:48.131 --> 01:12:49.132
The watcher?

852
01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:55.338
- Makes sense it's
you they want.

853
01:12:55.338 --> 01:12:58.174
It's you they've always wanted.

854
01:12:58.174 --> 01:13:00.744
In a way you created this place.

855
01:13:05.915 --> 01:13:09.218
- I didn't come out
here to fight you. Levi.

856
01:13:09.218 --> 01:13:10.954
I came out here to help you.

857
01:13:10.954 --> 01:13:13.256
- I don't want your help.

858
01:13:13.256 --> 01:13:15.492
One way or another you're
coming back with me.

859
01:13:15.492 --> 01:13:18.562
They won't allow
you to escape again.

860
01:13:20.997 --> 01:13:24.568
- If you want me. then
you come and get me.

861
01:13:39.282 --> 01:13:41.084
- That's more like it.

862
01:13:41.084 --> 01:13:43.553
- It doesn't have
to end this way.

863
01:13:43.553 --> 01:13:45.054
- End?

864
01:17:00.316 --> 01:17:02.551
- What is it. Henry?

865
01:17:02.551 --> 01:17:07.456
Sir. they. they found
Porter's body on the trail.

866
01:17:08.391 --> 01:17:09.225
I'm sorry.

867
01:17:10.694 --> 01:17:11.527
- Levi?

868
01:17:16.199 --> 01:17:18.868
- He said the Ree took his life.

869
01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:39.956
What will you have
me do. Captain?

870
01:17:47.063 --> 01:17:48.464
- Nothing. Henry.

871
01:17:50.934 --> 01:17:53.136
I was told of this day.
