[in English]
The economy won’t change itself. you know.

17
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.400
Neither can we. especially if they
keep taxing us ridiculously on policies

18
00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.520
that doesn't even favor
the least productive sector.

19
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.720
[in Hausa] It won’t work.

20

[Musty] Doing everything

And what do
you think I've been doing since?

Playing into their hands.

the safety of your husband.

come back home to me alive.

Of course. he will come back.

the most wanted person in the country.

- What are you saying?
- [Musty chuckles]

855
00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:42.880
I’m saying your house help knows
more about this. about what’s going on.

856
00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:45.640
That's why I had to scare her off

857
00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:47.960
‪into baiting her that
‪you went out to get the money.

858
00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:51.040
I don't understand.

859
00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:55.120
Fanna. if she had stayed after
how I narrated the incident to her …

860
00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:57.680
Honestly. she’s their
eyes and ears in here.

861
00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:00.400
- [in English] We didn't find any cameras…
- Sadiya.

862
00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:02.760
I told her that Fanna
went out to get the money.

863
00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:04.080
she did not even flinch.

864
00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:06.120
- What are you saying…
- She didn’t say one word.

865
00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:08.080
Because she knows she doesn't
have anything to lose.

866
00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:11.120
No matter how we
perceived her in this place.

867
00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:13.600
Trust me. it does not come close
to them losing their price.

868
00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:16.040
How does this help me?

869
00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:18.800
- How does this help this case?
- [Musty] In every way. Fanna.

870
00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:22.120
All I see is that you care more
about the money than my husband's life.

871
00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:26.120
Listen. they’re going to kill your loving
husband. if he’s not already dead by now.

872
00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:28.040
- Even after you pay the ransom.
- [gasps]

873
00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:30.000
I'm saying we
should get to know who is responsible

874
00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:31.960
‪so we can make alternative arrangements.

875
00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:35.200
[stutters] Then why are you so concerned
about pinning this on someone else?

876
00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:36.800
- And not helping me.
- Sadiya…

877
00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:39.880
The last time I checked the only person
with questionable character is you.

878

I just want you to come lie next to me.

1179
01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:13.840
[sighs] Me too.

1180
01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:19.040
[sighs] But I have to
take Sadiya’s phone back to her.

1181
01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:23.280
She forgot yesterday
while she left in anger

1182
01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:26.120
‪because I refused to
‪tell my parents what had happened.

1183
01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:30.320
I’m really sorry that you had to
go through all of that.

1184
01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:33.640
I was so scared.

1185
01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:37.520
- I thought I had lost you.
- No. never.

1186
01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:40.640
Never. They were never going to harm me.

1187
01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:42.200
All they wanted was the money

1188
01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:43.440
And as soon as you gave it to them.

1189
01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:45.280
[inhales] they were going to let me go.

1190
01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:47.600
[Abdul] But thank you.

1191
01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:50.560
For going above and beyond to save me.

1192
01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:03.160
I am…

1193
01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:04.600
I need my phone.

1194
01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:09.200
Oh. I brought it
out of the car last night.

1195
01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:10.440
‪Okay.

1196
01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:14.240
Did…

1197
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:18.960
Thank you.

1198
01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:22.000
Did anyone try to call me?

1199
01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:24.280
I don't know.

1200
01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:26.840
I've not checked.

1201
01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:40.640
Listen. I have to go now.

1202
01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:43.840
I have to make a quick stop at the market.

1203
01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:45.760
and pharmacy.

1204
01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:49.400
- Are you sure you'll be okay by yourself?
- Oh yes. I will be fine. Just go.

1205
01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:52.680
Or should I lock the gate from outside?

1206
01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:54.560
- No.
- Oh. yes. I should do that.

1207
01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:57.760
No. Listen. there's no need to do that.

1208
01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:00.840
I'm sure that they would assume
that we have beefed up security

1209
01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:03.640
and they would not risk
coming back and getting caught. So…

1210
01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:07.200
- I think we should do that…
- No…

1211
01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:11.480
What I mean is.
there’s no need to disturb anybody.

1212
01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:13.320
We’ve gone past this.

1213
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.480
It has happened.
let’s just move on with our lives.

1214
01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:18.320
Okay…

1215
01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:20.360
- Now go. Go and do what you have to do.
- Are you sure?

1216
01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:21.640
Yes. I am sure.

1217
01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:26.640
Okay.

1218
01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:29.720
- See you.
- I will see you.

[stutters] What…What are you doing here?

1238
01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
So this is really true.

1239

‪[sighs]

1240
01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:12.600
[sighs] I know beyond reasonable doubt

1241
01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:15.480
that you are a scam.

1242
01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:19.040
But somehow. somewhere.

1243
01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:23.040
I just hoped this was just a mistake.

1244
01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:26.400
[stutters] Yes. you’re right.
It’s a mistake. This is…

1245
01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:29.360
‪It’s a misunderstanding.
‪Fanna. I can explain.

1246
01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:31.640
But I know everything.

‪[gasps]

I know every…

1249
01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:39.680
[Fanna] I know you were married to your
criminal partner before you met me.

1250
01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:43.400
Yet. you pretended to be single…

1251
01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:45.560
and in love with me.

1252
01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:50.240
Just so you could
steal from me and my parents.

1253
01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:52.040
‪[Fanna sighs]

1254
01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:03.880
[sighs] You bribed the doctor

1255
01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:07.680
‪to make me believe
‪I was the reason for our childlessness.

1256
01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:11.160
When you had already done a vasectomy.

1257
01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:15.040
- [stutters] How. how did…
- No. don’t stress.[sighs]

1258
01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:17.080
Mustapha already dug out everything.

1259
01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:18.880
‪[whispers] Mustapha.

1260
01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:20.480
[Fanna] Yeah.

1261
01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:25.080
I should have done that myself when you
came selling for perfection!

1262
01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:27.600
Fanna…

1263
01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:30.880
- [stutters] I'm sorry.
- That you got caught?

1264
01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:33.320
You know what…

1265
01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:35.560
- I love you. Fanna.

Let's just get past this.

1267
01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:38.600
[stutters] We can work things out.

1268
01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:40.600
- Let's start afresh. just me and you.
- Abdul.

1269
01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:43.400
‪those words don’t mean anything anymore.

1270
01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:46.840
Fanna. honestly. it was all her idea.

1271
01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:48.320
She masterminded this whole thing.

1272
01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:51.200
‪I wanted to have
‪nothing to do with it. but she insisted.

1273
01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:52.120
She made me do this.

1274
01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:56.080
Blaming the very person
you brought into our home.

1275
01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:58.280
is weak. Abdul.

1276
01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:01.800
I'll never forgive you for that.

‪[gasps]

- [Fanna] Yes. I loved you.

[Abdul] Fanna. please.

1282
01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:20.960
[Fanna] But you made me go
through pain and grief in one day.

1283
01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:25.720
- I was running mad because of you.
- [Musty] I’m sorry.

‪I’ll never forgive you.
‪You both will pay for this.

No. there is no need…
Let’s not make any hasty decisions.

1288

It’s me. this is Abdul.

1289
01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:44.360
[Abdul] And yes…I was weak and I made
a mistake. but we can talk about it.

1290
01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:46.320
Please. let’s go to Turkey.

1291
01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:50.040
