<i>I must be mad.</i>

4
00:00:44.575 --> 00:00:46.495
<i>I should've known all along.</i>

5
00:00:47.095 --> 00:00:49.935
<i>If your hobby is death.
you must be mad.</i>

6
00:00:50.655 --> 00:00:53.175
<i>Mad I may be. Crazy I am not.</i>

7
00:00:53.575 --> 00:00:55.455
<i>Don't take me for a psycho.</i>

8
00:00:57.215 --> 00:00:59.015
<i>Corpses are not my thing.</i>

9
00:00:59.535 --> 00:01:01.575
<i>What interests me is Death.</i>

10
00:01:01.735 --> 00:01:03.015
<i>With a capital D.</i>

11
00:01:05.255 --> 00:01:06.855
<i>Corpses scare me.</i>

12
00:01:07.255 --> 00:01:09.015
<i>They have a terrible effect on me.</i>

13
00:01:09.895 --> 00:01:10.735
<i>Actually.</i>

14
00:01:11.095 --> 00:01:13.095
<i>one corpse had a terrible effect on me.</i>

15
00:01:14.175 --> 00:01:16.375
<i>That's what I'm telling you about.</i>

16
00:01:18.575 --> 00:01:20.215
<i>If Death doesn't interest you.</i>

17
00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:25.455
<i>if you don't want to hear
about a corpse I knew when it was alive.</i>

18
00:01:25.935 --> 00:01:29.335
<i>if you don't want to know
what happened to him and me.</i>

19
00:01:29.495 --> 00:01:31.295
<i>and how he became a corpse.</i>

20
00:01:31.775 --> 00:01:34.015
<i>you'd better stop right here.</i>

21
00:01:34.495 --> 00:01:36.095
This is no story for you.

SUMMER OF 85

23
00:02:19.815 --> 00:02:22.415
Hey. Chris!
Did you get into final year?

24
00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:24.095
Yeah. tech studies. You?

25
00:02:24.255 --> 00:02:26.935
Literature. I think.
Wanna celebrate on your boat?

26
00:02:27.495 --> 00:02:30.095
I'd love to. but...
I'm meeting someone.

27
00:02:30.455 --> 00:02:31.455
Who?

28
00:02:31.615 --> 00:02:32.655
Surprise.

29
00:02:32.815 --> 00:02:34.055
Skip your meeting.

30
00:02:34.215 --> 00:02:35.375
You can take the boat.

31
00:02:35.535 --> 00:02:37.455
It's boring to go alone.

32
00:02:40.695 --> 00:02:41.535
Sorry.

33
00:02:42.455 --> 00:02:43.855
- See you around.
- Bye.

34
00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:09.495
Help!

35
00:04:48.255 --> 00:04:49.175
Need help?

36
00:04:49.335 --> 00:04:50.655
Yeah.

37
00:04:51.735 --> 00:04:54.855
It's simple.
Get it upright and I'll tow you in.

38
00:04:55.935 --> 00:04:57.215
Try.

39
00:04:57.375 --> 00:04:58.175
Climb up.

40
00:05:01.295 --> 00:05:03.295
- These yours?
- Yeah.

41
00:05:06.455 --> 00:05:07.375
Ever done it?

42
00:05:08.695 --> 00:05:11.815
Grab the centreboard
and the boat'll turn over.

43
00:05:11.975 --> 00:05:13.255
Ok?

44
00:05:13.415 --> 00:05:15.415
Stand up. Good.

45
00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:17.255
Go on.

46
00:05:17.415 --> 00:05:21.015
<i>Enter David Gorman.
aged 18 years and 1 month.</i>

47
00:05:21.495 --> 00:05:24.015
<i>He's the future corpse.
David.</i>

48
00:05:44.215 --> 00:05:44.935
Here.

49
00:05:45.855 --> 00:05:46.775
Thanks.

50
00:05:47.535 --> 00:05:50.215
- You live out in Les Côteaux?
- Yeah.

51
00:05:50.695 --> 00:05:52.575
We'll go to my house. it's closer.

52
00:05:52.735 --> 00:05:54.095
Thanks. I'll be fine.

53
00:05:54.255 --> 00:05:57.295
Don't argue.
I know about capsizes.

54
00:05:57.935 --> 00:05:59.855
The boat belongs to a friend...

55
00:06:00.015 --> 00:06:01.815
I'll handle the boats after.

56
00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:03.575
Put on your jeans.

57
00:06:19.015 --> 00:06:22.055
- How are you. Alexis?
- It's Alex.

58
00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:23.335
Alex?

59
00:06:24.015 --> 00:06:25.495
Since this summer.

60
00:06:25.775 --> 00:06:26.735
Ok. Alex.

61
00:06:27.575 --> 00:06:29.055
Know why you're here?

62
00:06:30.695 --> 00:06:32.375
To discuss what you did.

63
00:06:32.775 --> 00:06:33.775
I don't want to.

64
00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:36.735
I'm not here to judge you.
but to understand.

65
00:06:36.895 --> 00:06:39.655
The judge needs to know
why you did it.

66
00:06:39.815 --> 00:06:42.095
- I'll give him my opinion.
- No.

67
00:06:42.695 --> 00:06:45.495
It's none of your business.
Or anyone's.

68
00:06:46.495 --> 00:06:48.895
Are Mrs. Gorman's accusations justified?

69
00:06:51.495 --> 00:06:54.495
Ok.
The police officer's report says.

70
00:06:54.655 --> 00:06:57.255
"The individual arrived at 11 p.m..."

71
00:06:57.535 --> 00:06:58.375
Alexis!

72
00:07:00.975 --> 00:07:02.695
You could go to jail.

73
00:07:03.215 --> 00:07:04.775
Get a heavy sentence.

74
00:07:05.575 --> 00:07:06.455
Come.

75
00:07:15.575 --> 00:07:17.415
See? I live close.

76
00:07:33.535 --> 00:07:34.495
Come in.

77
00:07:35.615 --> 00:07:37.775
- Hi. honey.
- Mum. meet Alex.

78
00:07:38.255 --> 00:07:39.495
No. it's Alexis.

79
00:07:40.415 --> 00:07:41.735
What'd you do to him?

80
00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:44.055
He capsized. that's all.

81
00:07:44.215 --> 00:07:47.295
I keep telling you
those boats are dangerous!

82
00:07:47.455 --> 00:07:48.335
It's ok.

83
00:07:48.495 --> 00:07:51.175
The poor darling
is freezing to death.

84
00:07:51.334 --> 00:07:53.974
A hot bath is all you need.

85
00:07:54.135 --> 00:07:54.934
In the tub!

86
00:07:55.095 --> 00:07:57.535
All David's capsized friends
go in the tub.

87
00:07:57.694 --> 00:08:00.094
Some do it on purpose I think.
Move!

88
00:08:00.495 --> 00:08:02.335
They must like my bathroom!

89
00:08:07.335 --> 00:08:08.695
Off with your clothes.

90
00:08:09.575 --> 00:08:11.015
What are you waiting for?

91
00:08:12.695 --> 00:08:14.615
Think I don't know about boys?

92
00:08:14.775 --> 00:08:15.575
Ma'am...

93
00:08:15.735 --> 00:08:19.535
Don't be like David.
Locks his mum out of the bathroom!

94
00:08:19.695 --> 00:08:22.855
I gave birth to him.
He's just bigger now.

95
00:08:23.015 --> 00:08:26.295
- I'm not used to...
- Your mum neglects you?

96
00:08:30.015 --> 00:08:31.215
In any case.

97
00:08:31.855 --> 00:08:33.335
she can be proud of you.

98
00:08:33.495 --> 00:08:34.855
Handsome boy.

99
00:08:35.775 --> 00:08:38.255
Hop in. you'll catch your death.

100
00:08:38.415 --> 00:08:40.415
I'll make you a sweet cup of tea.

101
00:08:40.575 --> 00:08:42.375
Nothing better after such a shock.

102
00:08:52.975 --> 00:08:55.575
<i>Bathtubs always remind me of coffins.</i>

103
00:08:55.935 --> 00:08:58.535
<i>The Gormans' reminded me
of a sarcophagus.</i>

104
00:08:59.015 --> 00:09:03.695
<i>The whole room reminded me
of the grave chamber in a pyramid.</i>

105
00:09:06.135 --> 00:09:06.935
Nice swim?

106
00:09:07.295 --> 00:09:08.375
Yeah.

107
00:09:08.535 --> 00:09:10.055
I thought it was your mum.

108
00:09:10.535 --> 00:09:12.375
I tricked her and snuck in.

109
00:09:12.535 --> 00:09:15.735
What's worse. capsizing
or being undressed by your mum?

110
00:09:15.895 --> 00:09:16.775
I'd rather capsize.

111
00:09:18.855 --> 00:09:20.575
Can you hand me the towel?

112
00:09:20.735 --> 00:09:22.335
- Sure.
- Thanks.

113
00:09:26.855 --> 00:09:29.975
Mum's going to the shop.
if you want to stay.

114
00:09:30.495 --> 00:09:33.415
I have to dock my pal's boat.
then go to school.

115
00:09:34.295 --> 00:09:35.135
Ok.

116
00:09:36.895 --> 00:09:38.775
I've got clean clothes for you.

117
00:09:39.175 --> 00:09:40.855
I'll deal with the boat.

118
00:09:41.175 --> 00:09:42.775
- Thanks.
- Sure.

119
00:09:45.295 --> 00:09:47.575
When you're done. it's the last door.

120
00:09:47.735 --> 00:09:48.735
Ok.

121
00:09:59.295 --> 00:10:01.135
- Here.
- Thanks.

122
00:10:01.295 --> 00:10:03.095
We're about the same size.

123
00:10:04.975 --> 00:10:06.895
- Shoe size?
- 8.

124
00:10:07.055 --> 00:10:09.015
I'm 9. Want some shoes?

125
00:10:09.175 --> 00:10:11.495
No thanks. mine'll dry out.

126
00:10:15.095 --> 00:10:16.455
- There.
- Thanks.

127
00:10:20.855 --> 00:10:22.695
- What's that?
- This...

128
00:10:23.855 --> 00:10:24.975
is for hair.

129
00:10:26.175 --> 00:10:27.415
There's a mirror.

130
00:10:27.735 --> 00:10:28.495
Cool.

131
00:10:30.375 --> 00:10:32.975
- Hungry?
- Yeah. but I'm late.

132
00:10:33.135 --> 00:10:36.615
Mum made us a snack.
She'll be upset if you don't eat.

133
00:10:37.255 --> 00:10:40.175
You two do this
to every boy who capsizes?

134
00:10:40.335 --> 00:10:41.335
'Course not.

135
00:10:41.495 --> 00:10:44.695
I'm off today. I can look after you.
C'mon.

136
00:10:47.175 --> 00:10:49.255
My father died suddenly last year.

137
00:10:49.415 --> 00:10:50.495
I'm sorry.

138
00:10:51.095 --> 00:10:52.455
Don't worry. it's over.

139
00:10:52.855 --> 00:10:54.815
He and Mum ran the shop.

140
00:10:54.975 --> 00:10:58.335
Mum did the accounts.
Dad knew a bit about sailing.

141
00:10:58.975 --> 00:11:02.455
He was a sailor when he was young.
Customers liked him.

142
00:11:03.055 --> 00:11:05.375
He could sell them anything.

143
00:11:06.735 --> 00:11:07.535
When he died.

144
00:11:07.855 --> 00:11:08.935
I had no choice.

145
00:11:09.095 --> 00:11:12.495
I quit school and started working
full time at the shop.

146
00:11:14.495 --> 00:11:16.695
Tough. leaving school
to be a salesman.

147
00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:17.975
I'm no salesman.

148
00:11:18.895 --> 00:11:19.975
I run the shop.

149
00:11:21.255 --> 00:11:22.135
Right.

150
00:11:22.655 --> 00:11:24.495
The shop earns our living.

151
00:11:25.495 --> 00:11:26.855
It was Dad's whole life.

152
00:11:27.015 --> 00:11:28.695
But not necessarily yours.

153
00:11:30.695 --> 00:11:32.535
Would you follow
your dad's footsteps?

154
00:11:33.695 --> 00:11:36.015
My dad's a docker at the shipyard.

155
00:11:36.175 --> 00:11:38.175
Don't wanna be a docker?

156
00:11:39.535 --> 00:11:42.015
- What do you wanna do?
- No idea.

157
00:11:42.295 --> 00:11:43.775
That's the big question.

158
00:11:43.935 --> 00:11:46.855
Get a job. or stay in school?

159
00:11:47.695 --> 00:11:50.175
That's why Lefèvre wants to see me.

160
00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:53.935
You can count on him
to give you his opinion.

161
00:11:54.095 --> 00:11:55.975
Did he counsel you too?

162
00:11:56.415 --> 00:11:57.335
A few times.

163
00:12:03.535 --> 00:12:05.295
You'll tell me about it tonight.

164
00:12:07.095 --> 00:12:09.655
What?
You gotta come get your clothes.

165
00:12:10.055 --> 00:12:11.055
Mum'll wash them.

166
00:12:11.215 --> 00:12:13.255
I'd like to get mine back too.

167
00:12:17.175 --> 00:12:21.335
I dock the boat. you see Lefèvre.
then we go to the cinema.

168
00:12:21.495 --> 00:12:22.415
Sound good?

169
00:12:23.055 --> 00:12:23.855
Yeah.

170
00:12:24.015 --> 00:12:25.775
- Meet me here at 8?
- Ok.

171
00:12:25.935 --> 00:12:26.695
Perfect.

172
00:12:31.815 --> 00:12:33.975
Mr. Robin. come in.

173
00:12:35.455 --> 00:12:36.335
So...

174
00:12:36.495 --> 00:12:38.495
Since when. the interest in death?

175
00:12:39.615 --> 00:12:41.215
As I wrote. it's been a while.

176
00:12:41.375 --> 00:12:43.655
As I kid. I loved the Egyptians.

177
00:12:43.815 --> 00:12:47.455
their relationship with death.
the funeral rites. the mummies.

178
00:12:48.215 --> 00:12:49.175
I see.

179
00:12:50.295 --> 00:12:53.295
Would you call
this modest piece of prose

180
00:12:53.455 --> 00:12:56.255
a documentary essay
or a work of fiction?

181
00:12:58.815 --> 00:13:00.215
I don't really know.

182
00:13:01.135 --> 00:13:03.415
It's about things I've felt.

183
00:13:04.895 --> 00:13:06.935
But I invented the details.

184
00:13:07.335 --> 00:13:09.375
I'll be frank with you. Mr. Robin.

185
00:13:09.535 --> 00:13:10.375
Yes?

186
00:13:11.695 --> 00:13:13.415
Your work is very promising.

187
00:13:14.615 --> 00:13:15.775
Thank you. sir.

188
00:13:15.935 --> 00:13:19.095
I'm not saying you're a literary genius.
far from it.

189
00:13:19.255 --> 00:13:23.375
Some of your classmates produce
more impressive work.

190
00:13:23.655 --> 00:13:24.975
But you're progressing.

191
00:13:25.495 --> 00:13:26.535
Thank you.

192
00:13:26.975 --> 00:13:29.295
Have you decided
what to do next year?

193
00:13:30.455 --> 00:13:32.335
Dad wants me to work...

194
00:13:32.495 --> 00:13:35.415
- And Mum wants you to be happy?
- Exactly.

195
00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:38.775
I pushed to have you
in my literature class.

196
00:13:40.015 --> 00:13:41.255
You're gifted.

197
00:13:41.415 --> 00:13:43.455
You're a credit to the school.

198
00:13:44.135 --> 00:13:46.415
I'll help if you decide to stay.

199
00:13:46.575 --> 00:13:47.655
Thank you. sir.

200
00:13:48.055 --> 00:13:49.735
Think it over.

201
00:13:49.895 --> 00:13:52.455
I'm here if you want to talk.

202
00:14:04.415 --> 00:14:06.535
Seeing the judge didn't change him.

203
00:14:06.695 --> 00:14:09.215
He wanders like a zombie.
shuts himself away.

204
00:14:09.375 --> 00:14:10.895
Won't even go to the beach.

205
00:14:11.055 --> 00:14:13.375
Alexis is a sweet boy.

206
00:14:13.535 --> 00:14:15.735
He's not like other boys his age.

207
00:14:15.895 --> 00:14:17.295
He's intelligent.

208
00:14:17.455 --> 00:14:21.295
But sometimes
we don't understand what he's saying.

209
00:14:21.455 --> 00:14:23.575
Maybe he needs a kick in the arse!

210
00:14:23.735 --> 00:14:26.335
I disagree.
He's had enough trauma.

211
00:14:26.495 --> 00:14:28.135
What we want.

212
00:14:28.735 --> 00:14:30.135
is for him to be ok.

213
00:14:30.575 --> 00:14:34.255
We want to help him.
He's our son and we love him.

214
00:14:38.575 --> 00:14:40.175
Your caseworker is here.

215
00:14:46.015 --> 00:14:46.855
Thank you.

216
00:14:50.535 --> 00:14:54.175
Your mother thinks I should meet
your teacher. Mr. Lefèvre.

217
00:14:57.535 --> 00:14:58.775
What do you think?

218
00:15:00.295 --> 00:15:01.495
I don't care.

219
00:15:02.015 --> 00:15:03.455
Do what you want.

220
00:15:05.775 --> 00:15:07.615
Ah. hello!

221
00:15:07.775 --> 00:15:09.935
David. it's your new friend.

222
00:15:10.095 --> 00:15:11.935
- The one who capsized.
- Let him in.

223
00:15:12.095 --> 00:15:13.295
Go on!

224
00:15:13.695 --> 00:15:17.535
David's a bad boy.
He came to work on his day off.

225
00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:19.975
He does that every week.

226
00:15:20.135 --> 00:15:22.255
- I brought your clothes.
- Thanks.

227
00:15:23.855 --> 00:15:26.535
- Hungry?
- No thanks. I ate at home.

228
00:15:26.695 --> 00:15:29.975
What good is a day off
if you go to work?

229
00:15:31.215 --> 00:15:32.855
He's worse than his father.

230
00:15:33.015 --> 00:15:36.375
A slave to that shop for 20 years.
Result? He's dead.

231
00:15:37.935 --> 00:15:40.535
I thought you were his friend.
Some friend!

232
00:15:42.135 --> 00:15:44.055
- Answer the lady.
- What?

233
00:15:44.695 --> 00:15:45.695
Are you my friend?

234
00:15:46.455 --> 00:15:47.895
Am I your friend?

235
00:15:48.055 --> 00:15:49.775
I think you are. but are you?

236
00:15:50.375 --> 00:15:52.255
- If you think so...
- You are?

237
00:15:52.975 --> 00:15:55.375
In which case we can safely say...

238
00:15:55.975 --> 00:15:57.735
That I'm indeed your friend.

239
00:15:57.895 --> 00:15:59.215
Some friend.

240
00:15:59.375 --> 00:16:02.895
letting you work
when you two should be out having fun.

241
00:16:03.054 --> 00:16:04.695
and you should be resting.

242
00:16:05.055 --> 00:16:06.654
Alex didn't know I went.

243
00:16:06.815 --> 00:16:09.375
He had an important meeting.
He's innocent.

244
00:16:09.534 --> 00:16:10.254
Is that true?

245
00:16:10.655 --> 00:16:11.655
Yeah.

246
00:16:11.855 --> 00:16:13.254
You're so cute.

247
00:16:14.495 --> 00:16:15.615
I could eat you up!

248
00:16:16.935 --> 00:16:18.654
My adorable little bunny!

249
00:16:18.815 --> 00:16:19.935
Mum...

250
00:16:20.775 --> 00:16:22.055
Your game show's on.

251
00:16:22.215 --> 00:16:23.334
Already?

252
00:16:24.095 --> 00:16:25.535
But my dishes!

253
00:16:25.695 --> 00:16:27.695
- We'll do them.
- Really?

254
00:16:27.855 --> 00:16:29.655
Then we'll go to the cinema.

255
00:16:30.255 --> 00:16:32.015
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

256
00:16:34.375 --> 00:16:36.575
David. don't stay out all night.

257
00:16:36.935 --> 00:16:37.775
I promise.

258
00:16:37.935 --> 00:16:39.895
- Alex. can I trust you?
- Yes.

259
00:16:40.135 --> 00:16:42.695
My David needs a real friend.

260
00:16:46.975 --> 00:16:48.695
It's lovely to see you together.

261
00:16:48.855 --> 00:16:50.695
- Goodnight. Mum.
- Goodnight.

262
00:16:52.975 --> 00:16:55.415
Shall we take my Suzuki?

263
00:16:55.575 --> 00:16:56.775
If you like.

264
00:16:57.455 --> 00:17:00.735
Wait. no spare helmet.
Too many cops in town.

265
00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:03.975
- I'll buy you one.
- Will we be taking a trip?

266
00:17:04.135 --> 00:17:05.255
Why not?

267
00:17:05.615 --> 00:17:07.975
Tuesday. Wednesday afternoon.

268
00:17:08.135 --> 00:17:10.335
Thursday. and Saturday all day.

269
00:17:10.495 --> 00:17:14.175
Mum's a genius with numbers
but hopeless with customers.

270
00:17:14.975 --> 00:17:16.695
It's too much for me alone.

271
00:17:16.855 --> 00:17:18.215
What's your mum say?

272
00:17:18.375 --> 00:17:21.215
She's counting on you.
She'd be so happy.

273
00:17:22.615 --> 00:17:23.935
I'll think about it.

274
00:17:24.495 --> 00:17:25.735
Scared of me?

275
00:17:25.895 --> 00:17:27.615
I just need to think.

276
00:17:27.775 --> 00:17:29.655
Ok. no need to shit bricks.

277
00:17:32.895 --> 00:17:35.455
- Bit more than a job offer though.
- No.

278
00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:39.055
Just be polite. relaxed. cheerful...

279
00:17:39.775 --> 00:17:41.175
It's not rocket science.

280
00:17:41.895 --> 00:17:43.975
Customers will love your angel face.

281
00:17:44.135 --> 00:17:45.735
I'm not thinking of them.

282
00:17:46.455 --> 00:17:47.735
Who. then?

283
00:17:48.855 --> 00:17:50.335
Want the truth?

284
00:17:51.415 --> 00:17:52.455
I dare you.

285
00:17:54.575 --> 00:17:57.495
- I'm thinking of you.
- Me? What'd I do now?

286
00:17:57.655 --> 00:17:59.935
We only met this morning.

287
00:18:00.095 --> 00:18:01.495
Why waste time?

288
00:18:02.055 --> 00:18:03.535
We're all mortals.

289
00:18:04.135 --> 00:18:05.295
Yeah.

290
00:18:05.935 --> 00:18:07.775
I need time to get used to it.

291
00:18:07.935 --> 00:18:09.375
Ok. I'll shut up.

292
00:19:07.935 --> 00:19:09.095
Here's an idea.

293
00:19:09.935 --> 00:19:11.215
We get a drink.

294
00:19:12.175 --> 00:19:13.815
My treat.
Then I take you home.

295
00:19:13.975 --> 00:19:15.455
Wait. look at that guy.

296
00:19:19.415 --> 00:19:20.215
Move. arsehole!

297
00:19:25.975 --> 00:19:26.815
Look out!

298
00:19:28.175 --> 00:19:29.615
What are you doing?

299
00:19:30.775 --> 00:19:31.615
Move!

300
00:19:31.775 --> 00:19:33.255
Shut up!

301
00:19:38.895 --> 00:19:40.095
Let me swim!

302
00:19:40.255 --> 00:19:41.695
No swimming for you.

303
00:19:42.655 --> 00:19:43.415
What do we do?

304
00:19:43.575 --> 00:19:46.575
Get him somewhere safe
so he can ferment.

305
00:19:46.735 --> 00:19:48.015
How about the morgue?

306
00:19:48.575 --> 00:19:49.375
The morgue?

307
00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:51.695
- Is it low tide?
- Yeah.

308
00:19:52.055 --> 00:19:54.695
- It's low tide.
- I'm gonna take a dip!

309
00:19:55.775 --> 00:19:57.295
Let him sleep it off.

310
00:19:57.455 --> 00:19:58.975
We can't leave him here.

311
00:19:59.135 --> 00:20:01.415
No one else cares.
He'll get hurt.

312
00:20:01.575 --> 00:20:04.375
Fuck him.
It's his own fault he's drunk.

313
00:20:05.135 --> 00:20:07.375
You didn't say that
this morning on the boat.

314
00:20:08.335 --> 00:20:11.255
Right. Thanks for saving me.
Mr. Good Shepherd!

315
00:20:11.415 --> 00:20:13.415
Anytime.
I don't see much difference

316
00:20:13.575 --> 00:20:17.255
between his drunken stupidity
and yours on that boat.

317
00:20:18.335 --> 00:20:19.735
- Guys...
- Yeah?

318
00:20:19.895 --> 00:20:21.655
I got a surprise for you.

319
00:20:21.815 --> 00:20:22.775
Now what?

320
00:20:23.295 --> 00:20:24.735
I pissed myself.

321
00:20:24.895 --> 00:20:25.815
Really?

322
00:20:28.215 --> 00:20:31.495
Alex. it's funny!
He wanted a swim and wet himself!

323
00:20:33.095 --> 00:20:34.095
You ok?

324
00:20:34.895 --> 00:20:36.175
Look. the beach.

325
00:20:36.335 --> 00:20:38.295
Slower. slower...

326
00:20:39.255 --> 00:20:42.575
Alex. stop sulking!
The night is young.

327
00:20:42.735 --> 00:20:44.775
I don't see why you're helping him.

328
00:20:44.935 --> 00:20:47.375
- You always need a reason?
- Yes.

329
00:20:47.535 --> 00:20:49.455
He's a nice guy. ok?

330
00:20:50.295 --> 00:20:52.255
Don't leave me. guys!

331
00:20:52.815 --> 00:20:53.855
Come help me.

332
00:20:54.295 --> 00:20:55.455
Get up.

333
00:20:57.175 --> 00:20:58.095
C'mon.

334
00:21:00.695 --> 00:21:01.655
We'll put him here.

335
00:21:01.815 --> 00:21:03.375
- Am I dead?
- Not yet.

336
00:21:03.535 --> 00:21:04.575
I feel dead...

337
00:21:04.735 --> 00:21:05.615
Fuck!

338
00:21:24.335 --> 00:21:26.895
<i>Discovering the sleeping boy's face.</i>

339
00:21:27.735 --> 00:21:31.135
<i>I realized why David
had insisted on rescuing him.</i>

340
00:21:33.135 --> 00:21:36.455
<i>And why. that very morning.
he'd come to rescue me.</i>

341
00:21:51.495 --> 00:21:52.735
Still not up?

342
00:21:53.015 --> 00:21:55.775
- I went to bed late. Dad.
- No excuses.

343
00:21:55.935 --> 00:21:59.095
Stop being lazy.
Hurry. your mother has work.

344
00:22:33.735 --> 00:22:35.575
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

345
00:22:40.215 --> 00:22:42.215
Mum. come have a coffee.

346
00:22:42.375 --> 00:22:44.255
It's not my coffee time yet.

347
00:22:44.415 --> 00:22:46.415
Treat yourself for once.

348
00:22:52.095 --> 00:22:53.455
You're right. love.

349
00:23:00.815 --> 00:23:03.935
Stop sleeping so late.
Your father's worried.

350
00:23:04.095 --> 00:23:06.935
What's he care?
I'm on holiday and he's at work.

351
00:23:07.095 --> 00:23:10.055
- He asks me what you do.
- Don't tell him.

352
00:23:10.215 --> 00:23:12.615
I can't lie to your father. love.

353
00:23:15.415 --> 00:23:17.695
It was past one when you came in.

354
00:23:19.935 --> 00:23:22.415
He says you need to find a job

355
00:23:22.575 --> 00:23:25.055
to keep you busy
and butter our bread.

356
00:23:25.215 --> 00:23:26.975
You want me to stay in school.

357
00:23:27.135 --> 00:23:29.135
He thinks if you worked...

358
00:23:29.295 --> 00:23:30.975
But what do you think?

359
00:23:31.135 --> 00:23:34.015
I want you to do
what makes you happy.

360
00:23:34.175 --> 00:23:37.255
- That's what counts.
- I don't know what would.

361
00:23:38.255 --> 00:23:41.535
Many people don't know.
and never find out.

362
00:23:44.015 --> 00:23:48.415
Lefèvre says I should stay in school.
graduate and study literature.

363
00:23:48.855 --> 00:23:50.975
- What use will that be?
- Not much.

364
00:23:51.295 --> 00:23:52.855
Even he says so.

365
00:23:53.455 --> 00:23:56.095
Strange teacher.
advising something of no use.

366
00:23:56.255 --> 00:23:59.015
- He meant for work.
- Work is what counts.

367
00:24:00.255 --> 00:24:01.375
Right. Mum.

368
00:24:05.495 --> 00:24:07.415
Fantastic. I'm thrilled.

369
00:24:07.895 --> 00:24:11.375
Come to the shop.
We'll discuss pay and celebrate.

370
00:24:12.415 --> 00:24:14.695
Mum wants to talk to you.

371
00:24:14.855 --> 00:24:15.815
Alex?

372
00:24:15.975 --> 00:24:17.055
Yes. Mrs. Gorman.

373
00:24:17.655 --> 00:24:19.895
- <i>Coming to work with us?</i>
- Yes.

374
00:24:20.055 --> 00:24:23.015
Splendid!
I'll finally have time for myself.

375
00:24:23.415 --> 00:24:24.575
But listen.

376
00:24:24.975 --> 00:24:26.935
<i>I'm a little upset with you.</i>

377
00:24:27.095 --> 00:24:27.815
Why?

378
00:24:27.975 --> 00:24:31.495
You promised
you wouldn't keep David out late.

379
00:24:31.655 --> 00:24:34.535
He came in at four.
You call that early?

380
00:24:34.895 --> 00:24:35.815
Four in the morning?

381
00:24:35.975 --> 00:24:37.215
<i>You promised me.</i>

382
00:24:37.375 --> 00:24:38.815
<i>Four is too late.</i>

383
00:24:38.975 --> 00:24:42.135
Especially when David works mornings.
Weekends are ok.

384
00:24:42.295 --> 00:24:44.135
- I'm sorry. but...
- <i>Never mind.</i>

385
00:24:44.295 --> 00:24:47.135
<i>I'll let it go this time.
Kisses. my little bunny.</i>

386
00:24:47.295 --> 00:24:49.455
<i>David says I talk too much.</i>

387
00:24:49.615 --> 00:24:50.735
Here he is.

388
00:24:53.055 --> 00:24:53.855
Alex?

389
00:24:54.255 --> 00:24:55.215
Yeah.

390
00:24:55.535 --> 00:24:57.015
<i>I'll explain tonight.</i>

391
00:24:57.535 --> 00:24:59.135
<i>We'll be a great team.</i>

392
00:24:59.615 --> 00:25:00.335
Sure.

393
00:25:01.055 --> 00:25:02.735
See you later. Alex.

394
00:25:13.295 --> 00:25:16.015
<i>David had asked me if I was his friend.</i>

395
00:25:16.175 --> 00:25:18.415
<i>But was he really mine?</i>

396
00:25:18.895 --> 00:25:21.855
<i>Someone you can count on
in any circumstance?</i>

397
00:25:22.255 --> 00:25:23.815
<i>Someone you can trust?</i>

398
00:25:25.735 --> 00:25:27.295
<i>Could I trust David?</i>

399
00:25:29.375 --> 00:25:30.415
The sea is fine.

400
00:25:30.775 --> 00:25:31.575
Don't you think?

401
00:25:31.735 --> 00:25:34.015
<i>Enter Kate. 21 years old.</i>

402
00:25:34.175 --> 00:25:36.575
Hope you don't mind me talking to you.

403
00:25:36.735 --> 00:25:38.055
Go right ahead.

404
00:25:38.415 --> 00:25:41.855
I need to work on my French.
I'm rather rusty.

405
00:25:42.015 --> 00:25:43.015
You speak well.

406
00:25:43.175 --> 00:25:43.975
Thanks!

407
00:25:44.135 --> 00:25:46.055
I only arrived 3 days ago.

408
00:25:46.215 --> 00:25:48.135
- Where from?
- England.

409
00:25:49.175 --> 00:25:50.455
My name is Kate.

410
00:25:50.935 --> 00:25:52.615
I'm Alex. Nice to meet you.

411
00:25:52.775 --> 00:25:53.575
Alex?

412
00:25:53.735 --> 00:25:57.055
Yeah. Short for Alexis.
I don't like Alexis.

413
00:25:57.495 --> 00:25:59.695
Alex is good. I like it.

414
00:26:02.855 --> 00:26:04.055
Right.

415
00:26:04.215 --> 00:26:06.135
I'm going to sunswim now.

416
00:26:09.055 --> 00:26:10.935
It's sunbathe. not sunswim.

417
00:26:11.655 --> 00:26:12.855
Sunbathe.

418
00:26:13.415 --> 00:26:15.255
Will you sunbathe with me?

419
00:26:15.815 --> 00:26:17.015
I'm meeting someone.

420
00:26:17.375 --> 00:26:19.615
A pretty girl. I suppose?

421
00:26:19.935 --> 00:26:22.615
No. a friend.
He's got a summer gig for me.

422
00:26:22.775 --> 00:26:23.935
Gig?

423
00:26:24.095 --> 00:26:25.255
A grind...

424
00:26:25.975 --> 00:26:27.015
a job!

425
00:26:27.535 --> 00:26:29.215
Must be a good friend.

426
00:26:29.735 --> 00:26:31.015
I don't know yet.

427
00:26:32.855 --> 00:26:35.255
Maybe we'll meet again?
Hope so.

428
00:26:36.575 --> 00:26:39.135
I work as an au pair girl.

429
00:26:39.575 --> 00:26:40.895
Are you on holiday?

430
00:26:41.055 --> 00:26:43.295
No. we moved here two years ago.

431
00:26:43.455 --> 00:26:45.295
See you around. I come often.

432
00:26:47.015 --> 00:26:48.215
Sounds good.

433
00:26:49.935 --> 00:26:50.735
Bye.

434
00:27:00.335 --> 00:27:02.015
Hi Alex. How are you?

435
00:27:02.175 --> 00:27:03.175
I'm ok.

436
00:27:03.655 --> 00:27:05.575
- Shall I show you the shop?
- Yeah.

437
00:27:10.975 --> 00:27:12.255
CLOSED

438
00:27:13.575 --> 00:27:15.135
Are you mad about last night?

439
00:27:15.695 --> 00:27:17.455
You went back to the drunk?

440
00:27:18.735 --> 00:27:20.215
Yeah. I felt guilty.

441
00:27:21.055 --> 00:27:23.175
Leaving him alone on the beach...

442
00:27:23.615 --> 00:27:24.655
I got scared.

443
00:27:25.575 --> 00:27:26.935
So I went back.

444
00:27:27.855 --> 00:27:30.215
Good thing too.
There were weirdos around.

445
00:27:31.055 --> 00:27:32.215
Then what?

446
00:27:32.375 --> 00:27:35.255
I woke him up and we talked until...

447
00:27:35.415 --> 00:27:37.095
Until four in the morning?

448
00:27:37.255 --> 00:27:39.255
Yeah. He was wasted.

449
00:27:39.415 --> 00:27:40.455
Stop. David.

450
00:27:41.015 --> 00:27:42.255
It's none of my business.

451
00:27:42.695 --> 00:27:44.895
Ok. Forget it. then.

452
00:27:45.735 --> 00:27:46.935
Close your eyes.

453
00:27:47.295 --> 00:27:48.895
- Why?
- Close your eyes.

454
00:27:49.055 --> 00:27:50.975
- Why?
- Got a surprise for you.

455
00:27:51.135 --> 00:27:52.255
A surprise?

456
00:27:53.855 --> 00:27:55.015
Close your eyes.

457
00:27:57.655 --> 00:27:59.095
So. where is it?

458
00:27:59.495 --> 00:28:01.135
Hang on. it's coming.

459
00:28:04.695 --> 00:28:05.855
Open them.

460
00:28:07.895 --> 00:28:09.215
- Is this it?
- Yeah.

461
00:28:09.375 --> 00:28:11.255
To hug roads. not boats.

462
00:28:14.975 --> 00:28:16.535
- It's...
- Beautiful.

463
00:28:17.175 --> 00:28:18.815
And it hides your ugly face.

464
00:28:20.215 --> 00:28:22.815
- But I don't have a bike.
- I do.

465
00:28:24.295 --> 00:28:26.655
You and I
will take a thousand trips.

466
00:28:27.415 --> 00:28:28.295
C'mon.

467
00:28:29.495 --> 00:28:31.495
It's your last night of freedom.

468
00:28:31.655 --> 00:28:34.455
Tomorrow. I'm your boss
and you're my slave.

469
00:28:38.815 --> 00:28:40.215
It's my first time.

470
00:28:40.855 --> 00:28:45.415
Never put your feet down.
Always keep them on the footrests.

471
00:28:45.575 --> 00:28:47.255
Here and here.

472
00:28:47.695 --> 00:28:50.055
Then relax.
Lean into the movement.

473
00:28:50.215 --> 00:28:51.455
Let yourself go.

474
00:28:51.615 --> 00:28:53.575
Hang on to me tight.

475
00:28:57.575 --> 00:28:58.655
Ready.

476
00:29:29.255 --> 00:29:30.815
<i>It wasn't anti-Semitic.</i>

477
00:29:31.655 --> 00:29:33.295
He and Gorman were close.

478
00:29:33.935 --> 00:29:36.575
Alexis was devastated.
He's still in shock.

479
00:29:36.895 --> 00:29:39.535
The judge needs a reason
for his behaviour.

480
00:29:39.775 --> 00:29:41.855
You're the only person he trusts.

481
00:29:42.935 --> 00:29:44.415
I need your help.

482
00:29:45.095 --> 00:29:47.175
If we don't know by next week.

483
00:29:47.335 --> 00:29:49.415
the judge will place him in detention.

484
00:29:52.135 --> 00:29:55.135
I can't betray my pupil's trust in me.

485
00:29:56.095 --> 00:29:58.775
- He must talk to you himself.
- He refuses.

486
00:29:59.895 --> 00:30:02.255
- I may have an idea.
- What?

487
00:30:03.295 --> 00:30:05.575
If you recommend he stays in school.

488
00:30:05.735 --> 00:30:09.575
I can't do anything
until I understand what happened.

489
00:30:17.775 --> 00:30:20.295
- Do you always drive like that?
- How?

490
00:30:20.855 --> 00:30:22.255
Dangerously fast.

491
00:30:22.415 --> 00:30:24.735
I don't go fast.
It doesn't feel fast.

492
00:30:24.895 --> 00:30:28.175
Are you kidding?
It sure felt like speed to me.

493
00:30:28.335 --> 00:30:29.175
Hang on.

494
00:30:29.335 --> 00:30:33.055
Fast is one thing. speed is another.
my little bunny.

495
00:30:33.215 --> 00:30:35.615
Don't call me your little bunny
like your mum.

496
00:30:35.775 --> 00:30:36.855
Ok. bunny!

497
00:30:37.015 --> 00:30:38.375
Cut it out. moron.

498
00:30:40.735 --> 00:30:42.335
Explain your speed thing.

499
00:30:42.495 --> 00:30:44.535
I never feel I'm going fast.

500
00:30:44.695 --> 00:30:48.015
But speed always feels near.
just in front of me.

501
00:30:48.335 --> 00:30:51.175
So I go faster and faster.
trying to catch it.

502
00:30:51.335 --> 00:30:53.455
But speed always stays
out of reach.

503
00:30:53.615 --> 00:30:56.815
I never feel like I'm going fast
or even accelerating.

504
00:30:56.975 --> 00:30:58.415
- Get it?
- Yeah.

505
00:30:59.055 --> 00:31:02.215
- What if you caught it?
- That's my dream.

506
00:31:02.375 --> 00:31:05.175
It'd be like being
in an invisible bubble

507
00:31:05.335 --> 00:31:08.175
that could take me anywhere
in a split second.

508
00:31:08.335 --> 00:31:11.135
I'd move effortlessly.
No sounds. no vibrations.

509
00:31:11.775 --> 00:31:13.095
Some dream.

510
00:31:13.655 --> 00:31:15.095
You never have such dreams?

511
00:31:55.175 --> 00:31:56.255
Hey. Chris!

512
00:31:56.695 --> 00:31:57.975
What's up?

513
00:31:58.135 --> 00:31:59.775
This is my friend David.

514
00:32:00.055 --> 00:32:01.215
Nice to meet you.

515
00:32:01.375 --> 00:32:02.535
You screwed me.

516
00:32:02.695 --> 00:32:04.895
- What do you mean?
- My boat. asshole.

517
00:32:05.575 --> 00:32:06.455
You should've told me.

518
00:32:06.895 --> 00:32:09.775
I had to tow it and pay a fine.

519
00:32:09.935 --> 00:32:11.255
Sorry. my fault.

520
00:32:11.415 --> 00:32:13.695
Who asked you. clown?

521
00:32:13.855 --> 00:32:15.295
Don't call me names.

522
00:32:15.455 --> 00:32:17.655
I'll call you what I like. faggot!

523
00:32:18.295 --> 00:32:19.095
Stop!

524
00:32:20.135 --> 00:32:21.135
Stop!

525
00:32:24.415 --> 00:32:25.215
Stop!

526
00:32:27.615 --> 00:32:28.495
Cops!

527
00:32:29.135 --> 00:32:30.855
- Cops!
- David!

528
00:32:31.255 --> 00:32:32.855
Break it up!

529
00:32:33.055 --> 00:32:34.255
C'mon. David!

530
00:32:34.455 --> 00:32:35.615
Run!

531
00:32:38.935 --> 00:32:40.935
Grab the helmets!

532
00:32:54.175 --> 00:32:55.055
Wow!

533
00:32:55.655 --> 00:32:56.975
- You got creamed!
- Fuck!

534
00:32:59.335 --> 00:33:01.135
Did you see Chris' face?

535
00:33:01.655 --> 00:33:02.535
Sorry.

536
00:33:20.895 --> 00:33:22.055
Take that off.

537
00:33:22.535 --> 00:33:23.495
Go on.

538
00:33:26.655 --> 00:33:27.935
What a bastard.

539
00:33:34.295 --> 00:33:35.815
- Does it hurt?
- Yes.

540
00:34:18.335 --> 00:34:19.495
Feel ok?

541
00:34:23.935 --> 00:34:26.495
I know what you're
going through is difficult.

542
00:34:26.655 --> 00:34:31.415
Your relationship with David Gorman
is hard for many to understand.

543
00:34:33.135 --> 00:34:34.855
But you're not alone.

544
00:34:37.175 --> 00:34:40.535
What I mean is.
you need to save your skin.

545
00:34:41.455 --> 00:34:44.855
The caseworker and judge
are capable of understanding.

546
00:34:45.335 --> 00:34:47.735
You have no choice. you must explain.

547
00:34:48.615 --> 00:34:50.615
The story of your "friendship."

548
00:34:51.175 --> 00:34:52.935
The reasons for your behaviour.

549
00:34:53.095 --> 00:34:54.415
I can't seem to.

550
00:34:55.615 --> 00:34:58.055
Sometimes it's easier to write.

551
00:35:00.375 --> 00:35:02.535
You know I admire your writing.

552
00:35:03.855 --> 00:35:05.535
Write your story.

553
00:35:06.535 --> 00:35:09.415
Tell it with your words. your emotions.

554
00:35:10.135 --> 00:35:11.295
Your pain.

555
00:35:35.655 --> 00:35:37.375
<i>Where do I start?</i>

556
00:35:42.935 --> 00:35:44.055
Coming?

557
00:35:48.335 --> 00:35:50.895
- Your mother?
- Don't worry. she's asleep.

558
00:36:01.495 --> 00:36:04.655
<i>You want me to describe
what happened behind that door?</i>

559
00:36:04.815 --> 00:36:05.735
<i>Only normal.</i>

560
00:36:05.895 --> 00:36:09.015
<i>We all want to know
the secrets behind closed doors.</i>

561
00:36:09.415 --> 00:36:10.935
<i>But I won't tell you.</i>

562
00:36:11.735 --> 00:36:13.055
<i>Just one thing.</i>

563
00:36:13.695 --> 00:36:16.015
<i>It was the most beautiful night
of my life.</i>

564
00:36:16.375 --> 00:36:18.135
<i>And it was with David.</i>

565
00:36:25.575 --> 00:36:26.575
I gotta go.

566
00:36:27.135 --> 00:36:28.175
Stay.

567
00:36:28.335 --> 00:36:31.135
I can't.
Mum worries and Dad yells.

568
00:36:31.295 --> 00:36:32.695
Tomorrow night?

569
00:36:33.575 --> 00:36:35.735
Ok. but you'll be the death of me.

570
00:36:38.975 --> 00:36:40.775
I'm dead tired already.

571
00:36:42.015 --> 00:36:43.375
Always on about death.

572
00:36:44.415 --> 00:36:45.935
It worries you that much?

573
00:36:47.015 --> 00:36:49.175
- No.
- Then why talk about it?

574
00:36:49.615 --> 00:36:51.015
It interests me.

575
00:36:51.815 --> 00:36:52.615
Not you?

576
00:36:54.335 --> 00:36:55.455
Not much.

577
00:36:55.895 --> 00:36:57.215
And your dad?

578
00:37:00.215 --> 00:37:01.615
That's different.

579
00:37:02.015 --> 00:37:04.095
I'm alive and my dad is gone.

580
00:37:05.175 --> 00:37:06.495
I miss him.

581
00:37:06.975 --> 00:37:08.775
That's what's hard about death.

582
00:37:09.415 --> 00:37:11.575
The absence of the ones you loved.

583
00:37:12.775 --> 00:37:15.335
You seem fascinated
by the idea of death.

584
00:37:17.415 --> 00:37:19.335
Yeah. maybe.

585
00:37:19.495 --> 00:37:21.295
Know what we should do with death?

586
00:37:22.535 --> 00:37:24.015
Laugh in its face.

587
00:37:25.335 --> 00:37:27.255
Easy to say when we're young.

588
00:37:33.855 --> 00:37:35.695
You and I should take an oath.

589
00:37:36.495 --> 00:37:38.175
- An oath?
- Yeah.

590
00:37:40.135 --> 00:37:42.175
Whoever dies first.

591
00:37:43.095 --> 00:37:44.455
the other promises

592
00:37:45.535 --> 00:37:46.895
to dance on his grave.

593
00:37:49.335 --> 00:37:50.495
See? You're mad.

594
00:37:50.655 --> 00:37:51.735
Think I'm joking?

595
00:37:51.895 --> 00:37:53.855
No. I think you're insane.

596
00:37:58.695 --> 00:38:00.375
Gotta change this hair.

597
00:38:00.655 --> 00:38:02.695
- How so?
- Dunno.

598
00:38:03.615 --> 00:38:05.095
I'll try tomorrow.

599
00:38:05.695 --> 00:38:07.615
- With your magic comb?
- No.

600
00:38:08.735 --> 00:38:10.135
With scissors.

601
00:38:15.455 --> 00:38:16.535
Promise me?

602
00:38:17.335 --> 00:38:19.455
If I die first.
you dance on my grave.

603
00:38:19.615 --> 00:38:22.215
- Don't be dumb.
- I'm very serious.

604
00:38:22.695 --> 00:38:25.815
- You'll live to be 90.
- No buts. just promise.

605
00:38:26.535 --> 00:38:27.775
- Why?
- For me.

606
00:38:28.215 --> 00:38:30.175
- I'm tired. let me go.
- No.

607
00:38:30.335 --> 00:38:32.175
Just promise. no big deal.

608
00:38:32.335 --> 00:38:34.695
- Is it that hard?
- No. but...

609
00:38:34.855 --> 00:38:36.175
I don't understand.

610
00:38:36.335 --> 00:38:38.495
Stop trying to understand everything.

611
00:38:39.855 --> 00:38:41.895
Some things you'll never understand.

612
00:38:43.255 --> 00:38:44.095
So promise.

613
00:38:51.815 --> 00:38:53.615
<i>Why keep arguing?</i>

614
00:38:55.535 --> 00:38:57.895
<i>The friend of my dreams
stood before me</i>

615
00:38:58.055 --> 00:39:00.455
<i>and asked me to take a stupid oath.</i>

616
00:39:01.535 --> 00:39:05.575
<i>At that moment.
there was nothing I could refuse him.</i>

617
00:39:05.735 --> 00:39:07.055
I promise.

618
00:39:07.215 --> 00:39:08.255
For you.

619
00:39:08.855 --> 00:39:10.455
And no other reason.

620
00:39:30.815 --> 00:39:32.455
<i>From beginning to end</i>

621
00:39:32.615 --> 00:39:33.735
<i>was six weeks.</i>

622
00:39:34.415 --> 00:39:35.535
<i>1.008 hours.</i>

623
00:39:35.695 --> 00:39:37.815
<i>60.480 minutes.</i>

624
00:39:38.495 --> 00:39:41.535
<i>3.628.800 seconds.</i>

625
00:39:42.855 --> 00:39:45.575
<i>The whole time. even up to now.</i>

626
00:39:45.735 --> 00:39:48.455
<i>I wondered: Why David?</i>

627
00:39:49.295 --> 00:39:51.255
<i>Why him and not another?</i>

628
00:39:51.415 --> 00:39:53.975
<i>It can't be just his looks.</i>

629
00:39:54.335 --> 00:39:58.535
<i>It can't be just physical. sexual.
Can it?</i>

630
00:39:58.695 --> 00:40:01.375
For codfish and bass. these are best.

631
00:40:01.535 --> 00:40:02.975
I trust you.

632
00:40:04.495 --> 00:40:07.575
Two packets.
You can exchange.

633
00:40:07.735 --> 00:40:08.895
Now for a rod...

634
00:40:09.055 --> 00:40:11.055
Alex. help me for the rod.

635
00:40:11.215 --> 00:40:14.015
- We're fixing something.
- You're here too?

636
00:40:14.175 --> 00:40:15.175
I didn't know.

637
00:40:15.735 --> 00:40:18.495
This is our latest model...

638
00:40:19.535 --> 00:40:22.415
Highly recommended. Fantastic.

639
00:40:23.975 --> 00:40:25.895
This is the latest model.

640
00:40:26.535 --> 00:40:28.895
But your husband should come in.

641
00:42:50.215 --> 00:42:52.055
<i>Maybe I loved him.</i>

642
00:42:52.895 --> 00:42:54.255
<i>I believed I did.</i>

643
00:42:54.415 --> 00:42:57.895
<i>I loved him as much as
I understood the meaning of the word.</i>

644
00:42:58.295 --> 00:43:00.055
<i>How do you ever know?</i>

645
00:43:00.975 --> 00:43:03.895
<i>I always thought I'd know
the minute it happened.</i>

646
00:43:05.575 --> 00:43:08.455
<i>But all I knew
was I couldn't get enough of him.</i>

647
00:43:09.855 --> 00:43:13.295
<i>I wanted to spend
every second of my time with him.</i>

648
00:43:14.335 --> 00:43:17.935
<i>But when I was with him.
that wasn't enough either.</i>

649
00:43:18.535 --> 00:43:22.175
<i>I wanted to look at him.
touch him. feel his touch.</i>

650
00:43:22.535 --> 00:43:25.175
<i>I wanted us to be together all the time.</i>

651
00:43:25.335 --> 00:43:27.895
<i>for 3.628.800 seconds.</i>

652
00:44:32.215 --> 00:44:33.855
I was so worried.

653
00:44:34.695 --> 00:44:37.295
He was keeping bad company.

654
00:44:37.975 --> 00:44:39.775
Got into plenty of trouble.

655
00:44:40.215 --> 00:44:43.175
Running wild night and day.
Worried me sick.

656
00:44:44.495 --> 00:44:47.215
It's not his fault. he was unhappy.

657
00:44:48.135 --> 00:44:51.615
Now the David we love is back.
Thanks to you.

658
00:44:52.255 --> 00:44:54.575
It's true.
He'd been so unhappy

659
00:44:55.135 --> 00:44:56.735
since his father died.

660
00:44:57.695 --> 00:44:59.015
You do each other good.

661
00:44:59.615 --> 00:45:02.335
- Thanks. Mrs. Gorman.
- No. thank you.

662
00:45:02.495 --> 00:45:05.255
Maybe you can even
improve business together.

663
00:45:05.855 --> 00:45:06.855
Meaning?

664
00:45:07.015 --> 00:45:08.655
I've been thinking.

665
00:45:08.895 --> 00:45:10.735
Why don't you work full-time

666
00:45:10.895 --> 00:45:12.095
in the fall?

667
00:45:13.295 --> 00:45:14.935
It's a good job. good pay.

668
00:45:15.095 --> 00:45:17.855
In a few years.
once you learn the ropes.

669
00:45:18.015 --> 00:45:20.935
we could open a second store
in the tourist area.

670
00:45:21.495 --> 00:45:23.655
That was Simon's dream.

671
00:45:24.175 --> 00:45:25.295
My husband.

672
00:45:25.815 --> 00:45:27.255
What do you say?

673
00:45:28.375 --> 00:45:29.655
Does David want to?

674
00:45:29.815 --> 00:45:32.855
He hasn't said.
but I know he thinks about it.

675
00:45:33.015 --> 00:45:36.255
- Will you think about it too?
- Ok. I will.

676
00:45:52.775 --> 00:45:54.775
Do you mind your mum next door?

677
00:45:56.695 --> 00:45:58.135
Does she mind?

678
00:45:59.295 --> 00:46:02.255
She takes strong sleeping pills
since Dad died.

679
00:46:04.695 --> 00:46:06.615
Think she knows about us?

680
00:46:07.255 --> 00:46:09.935
She's good at seeing
what she wants to see.

681
00:46:19.415 --> 00:46:22.415
<i>"You must forgive us everything.</i>

682
00:46:22.575 --> 00:46:23.535
<i>In this way.</i>

683
00:46:23.695 --> 00:46:25.055
we will be happiest.

684
00:46:25.655 --> 00:46:28.015
And. if sorrow our life does bring.

685
00:46:28.175 --> 00:46:30.535
We shall weep together.
and be blessed."

686
00:46:30.695 --> 00:46:33.415
"Let us be two children. two young men.

687
00:46:34.175 --> 00:46:36.535
Enamoured of nothing. amazed by all.

688
00:46:36.695 --> 00:46:39.655
Who go and lie pale under leafy stems.

689
00:46:40.255 --> 00:46:42.575
Not knowing all is forgiven them."

690
00:46:46.975 --> 00:46:48.615
- Verlaine.
- Yeah.

691
00:46:49.055 --> 00:46:52.335
- They say he wrote it for Rimbaud.
- How do you know it?

692
00:46:53.255 --> 00:46:55.495
Think you're Lefèvre's only pet?

693
00:46:57.495 --> 00:47:00.575
- You had Lefèvre when you quit school?
- Yeah.

694
00:47:00.735 --> 00:47:02.855
He was furious when I left.

695
00:47:03.575 --> 00:47:05.735
He said I was betraying my talent.

696
00:47:05.895 --> 00:47:08.575
wasting my life
with an abusive mother.

697
00:47:09.095 --> 00:47:10.735
Fucker didn't spare me.

698
00:47:10.895 --> 00:47:13.575
Did you tell him about the shop
and your father?

699
00:47:13.735 --> 00:47:15.255
He must've understood.

700
00:47:15.415 --> 00:47:16.575
Did you?

701
00:47:17.215 --> 00:47:18.895
Not at first. but I do now.

702
00:47:19.255 --> 00:47:21.055
Should we hire Lefèvre?

703
00:47:21.895 --> 00:47:23.015
That'd be funny.

704
00:47:23.615 --> 00:47:24.975
For you.

705
00:47:25.495 --> 00:47:26.855
Not for the customers.

706
00:47:29.735 --> 00:47:31.095
Still think about it?

707
00:47:31.775 --> 00:47:33.335
Lefèvre or leaving school?

708
00:47:34.055 --> 00:47:35.215
Both.

709
00:47:37.775 --> 00:47:39.615
No. not really.

710
00:47:41.175 --> 00:47:42.335
And your father?

711
00:47:43.935 --> 00:47:45.055
Always.

712
00:47:50.615 --> 00:47:52.175
Was he the oath?

713
00:47:53.175 --> 00:47:54.215
What?

714
00:47:54.735 --> 00:47:56.735
Did he ask you to dance on his grave?

715
00:47:58.255 --> 00:47:59.215
No.

716
00:48:02.695 --> 00:48:04.335
I would've loved that.

717
00:48:23.735 --> 00:48:26.215
You always wear the same clothes.
Money troubles?

718
00:48:26.375 --> 00:48:28.255
- Not only.
- So why?

719
00:48:28.415 --> 00:48:31.215
I never know what suits me.
I see things I like.

720
00:48:31.375 --> 00:48:33.215
- Yeah.
- Like this.

721
00:48:33.375 --> 00:48:34.935
Then it doesn't suit me.

722
00:48:35.095 --> 00:48:36.415
This would suit you.

723
00:48:37.455 --> 00:48:39.655
- Shut up.
- You'd get me even hotter.

724
00:48:39.815 --> 00:48:41.495
Pervert. Get off me.

725
00:48:42.575 --> 00:48:43.375
C'mon.

726
00:48:43.935 --> 00:48:45.735
Let's give you a makeover!

727
00:48:51.215 --> 00:48:52.335
Not bad.

728
00:48:53.655 --> 00:48:54.775
Try this.

729
00:48:58.415 --> 00:49:00.415
- How much is this?
- 149 francs.

730
00:49:03.375 --> 00:49:04.975
Try this first.

731
00:49:30.615 --> 00:49:31.735
Alexis!

732
00:50:09.615 --> 00:50:10.815
- Hello Alex!
- Kate!

733
00:50:14.055 --> 00:50:17.055
I don't usually have such an effect.

734
00:50:17.575 --> 00:50:19.255
Kate. meet David.

735
00:50:19.895 --> 00:50:22.335
Kate's an au pair
improving her French.

736
00:50:22.495 --> 00:50:23.855
Nice to meet you.

737
00:50:24.015 --> 00:50:26.615
I saw you two on a boat.

738
00:50:26.775 --> 00:50:28.575
- It had a nice name.
- Calypso?

739
00:50:28.735 --> 00:50:30.055
Calypso. that's it.

740
00:50:30.215 --> 00:50:31.495
My father named it.

741
00:50:31.975 --> 00:50:33.215
He was a sailor.

742
00:50:34.295 --> 00:50:35.255
Rather beautiful.

743
00:50:35.895 --> 00:50:37.255
Thank you.

744
00:50:37.895 --> 00:50:40.375
- We could take Kate out sometime.
- Sure.

745
00:50:40.535 --> 00:50:42.495
- I'd love that.
- Really?

746
00:50:42.935 --> 00:50:45.855
- Can you sail?
- If someone explains it to me.

747
00:50:46.015 --> 00:50:47.615
Don't worry. he'll explain.

748
00:50:48.135 --> 00:50:49.615
Are you a good swimmer?

749
00:50:49.775 --> 00:50:51.935
- I think so.
- Alex here...

750
00:50:52.935 --> 00:50:54.375
excels at capsizing.

751
00:50:54.535 --> 00:50:55.455
Stop it.

752
00:50:55.615 --> 00:50:57.095
- No?
- No.

753
00:50:57.255 --> 00:50:59.735
Then you should stay in charge.

754
00:50:59.895 --> 00:51:01.735
Don't worry. he will.

755
00:51:02.335 --> 00:51:03.935
- Let's go now.
- Where?

756
00:51:04.495 --> 00:51:05.495
On the Calypso.

757
00:51:05.975 --> 00:51:06.775
Why not?

758
00:51:07.055 --> 00:51:08.895
- Got your stuff?
- Over there.

759
00:51:09.055 --> 00:51:10.135
Let's go.

760
00:51:10.815 --> 00:51:12.055
Wait a sec.

761
00:51:12.215 --> 00:51:13.895
Get your stuff and join us.

762
00:51:25.295 --> 00:51:27.335
<i>That was how the end began.</i>

763
00:51:29.135 --> 00:51:32.735
<i>Trouble is. there's so much
I don't remember about the end.</i>

764
00:51:33.495 --> 00:51:38.055
<i>making it hard to tell the police.
the judge or the caseworker.</i>

765
00:51:42.055 --> 00:51:44.735
<i>Other bits I remember in great detail.</i>

766
00:51:44.895 --> 00:51:47.535
<i>The rescue. our first night.</i>

767
00:51:47.935 --> 00:51:49.815
<i>the frisson in the cinema.</i>

768
00:51:49.975 --> 00:51:51.655
<i>our motorcycle rides.</i>

769
00:51:52.095 --> 00:51:54.975
<i>I can describe them
heartbeat by heartbeat.</i>

770
00:51:55.935 --> 00:51:57.695
<i>They were great moments.</i>

771
00:51:58.375 --> 00:52:00.495
<i>4Made great by being together.</i>

772
00:52:01.335 --> 00:52:02.535
<i>Nothing else.</i>

773
00:52:04.135 --> 00:52:06.975
<i>But the beginning of the end
was not a great moment.</i>

774
00:52:07.135 --> 00:52:08.415
<i>It was trivial.</i>

775
00:52:09.095 --> 00:52:10.255
<i>Ordinary.</i>

776
00:52:10.735 --> 00:52:12.215
<i>And dead sad.</i>

777
00:52:13.495 --> 00:52:15.495
Hello. sir. Have a nice day.

778
00:52:21.295 --> 00:52:22.415
Hi. handsome!

779
00:52:24.415 --> 00:52:25.775
How's business?

780
00:52:26.575 --> 00:52:28.455
- Slow.
- Tough shit.

781
00:52:29.255 --> 00:52:31.175
- Had a good night?
- Yeah.

782
00:52:32.015 --> 00:52:34.255
Full of contortions
and erotic sensations.

783
00:52:34.415 --> 00:52:35.815
I can tell from here.

784
00:52:35.975 --> 00:52:37.975
- Really?
- I had a good teacher.

785
00:52:38.135 --> 00:52:40.255
By the way. no class today.

786
00:52:40.415 --> 00:52:42.655
So what?
I didn't sign up for English.

787
00:52:46.095 --> 00:52:47.575
Bit cranky this morning?

788
00:52:47.735 --> 00:52:49.455
Bit obnoxious this morning?

789
00:52:49.615 --> 00:52:51.215
Don't push your luck.

790
00:52:51.375 --> 00:52:52.975
- Me pushing my luck?
- Yeah.

791
00:52:53.335 --> 00:52:54.535
Look who's talking.

792
00:52:55.495 --> 00:52:56.895
You don't own me. pal.

793
00:52:57.055 --> 00:52:58.415
Did I say I did?

794
00:52:58.975 --> 00:53:01.935
- Don't call me pal.
- Sorry. little bunny.

795
00:53:03.175 --> 00:53:04.735
I thought we were friends.

796
00:53:04.895 --> 00:53:06.575
Bit more than friends. no?

797
00:53:07.495 --> 00:53:09.815
You came after me. remember.

798
00:53:10.215 --> 00:53:11.335
I came after you?

799
00:53:11.495 --> 00:53:13.175
- No I didn't.
- What?

800
00:53:13.335 --> 00:53:15.615
- Wishful thinking.
- You hit on me!

801
00:53:15.775 --> 00:53:18.855
You came to my rescue.
waving my jeans in the air!

802
00:53:19.215 --> 00:53:22.375
You gave me a bath.
loaned me your clothes.

803
00:53:22.535 --> 00:53:24.495
made eyes at me as we ate!

804
00:53:24.655 --> 00:53:27.015
Fondled me at the cinema!

805
00:53:27.175 --> 00:53:29.415
Calm the fuck down!

806
00:53:30.415 --> 00:53:32.655
I don't remember you resisting.

807
00:53:33.855 --> 00:53:34.895
Hello. ma'am.

808
00:53:35.055 --> 00:53:36.615
- How are you?
- Fine. thanks.

809
00:53:36.775 --> 00:53:39.615
- How can I help?
- I'd like a rod.

810
00:53:45.375 --> 00:53:46.415
Why?

811
00:53:48.415 --> 00:53:49.895
What does it matter?

812
00:53:50.495 --> 00:53:52.935
- Nothing happened.
- Nothing at all?

813
00:53:53.375 --> 00:53:55.455
Nothing worth bothering about.

814
00:53:55.935 --> 00:53:57.535
I want to understand why.

815
00:53:58.975 --> 00:54:00.775
- You're getting annoying.
- Tell me.

816
00:54:00.935 --> 00:54:02.415
It's happened before.

817
00:54:02.815 --> 00:54:05.615
No big deal.
You didn't shit bricks before.

818
00:54:05.775 --> 00:54:08.255
- This is different.
- Because it's a girl?

819
00:54:08.655 --> 00:54:09.815
Then why?

820
00:54:09.975 --> 00:54:12.455
You dropped me like an old sock.

821
00:54:13.095 --> 00:54:16.615
You seduced her on the boat
like I wasn't there.

822
00:54:16.775 --> 00:54:21.215
Made me dock the boat
while you played with your new toy.

823
00:54:21.655 --> 00:54:24.735
You dump me.
then act like all is well!

824
00:54:24.895 --> 00:54:28.015
I'm not a maid at your service. pal!

825
00:54:28.335 --> 00:54:29.895
Are you done?

826
00:54:30.055 --> 00:54:31.295
No. tell me why.

827
00:54:31.455 --> 00:54:33.495
You don't really want to know.

828
00:54:34.095 --> 00:54:36.895
I think you're just jealous.
It'll pass.

829
00:54:37.055 --> 00:54:38.815
- Don't patronize me!
- I'm explaining.

830
00:54:38.975 --> 00:54:41.695
You call this an explanation?

831
00:54:41.855 --> 00:54:43.295
Ok. know what?

832
00:54:43.455 --> 00:54:45.135
Let's make peace.

833
00:54:46.215 --> 00:54:48.375
I behaved badly. Sorry.

834
00:54:49.495 --> 00:54:52.615
We go back to how we were.
forget this. and be happy.

835
00:54:52.775 --> 00:54:53.815
Stop it!

836
00:54:54.735 --> 00:54:55.975
Not this time.

837
00:54:59.855 --> 00:55:01.775
<i>I don't know when I decided.</i>

838
00:55:01.935 --> 00:55:03.575
<i>Right then. I guess.</i>

839
00:55:04.215 --> 00:55:06.935
<i>As soon as I said it.
I knew I'd regret it.</i>

840
00:55:08.175 --> 00:55:09.695
<i>Deep silence.</i>

841
00:55:10.295 --> 00:55:12.215
<i>Eyes on eyes. waiting.</i>

842
00:55:14.095 --> 00:55:16.575
<i>It was the saddest moment of my life.</i>

843
00:55:16.735 --> 00:55:19.775
Careful. Alex.
Some things are better left unsaid.

844
00:55:20.255 --> 00:55:21.975
You can't take them back.

845
00:55:22.135 --> 00:55:24.455
Like oaths of eternal friendship?

846
00:55:24.615 --> 00:55:26.855
Swearing to dance on graves?

847
00:55:27.015 --> 00:55:28.415
Is that what you mean?

848
00:55:33.255 --> 00:55:34.615
You want to know?

849
00:55:35.495 --> 00:55:36.855
Ok. I'll tell you.

850
00:55:37.695 --> 00:55:38.815
I'm getting bored.

851
00:55:39.735 --> 00:55:41.895
- Bored?
- Bored. yes.

852
00:55:42.335 --> 00:55:43.535
With what?

853
00:55:43.695 --> 00:55:46.015
- With who.
- What. who?

854
00:55:46.615 --> 00:55:47.575
You.

855
00:55:49.135 --> 00:55:50.175
Me?

856
00:55:50.935 --> 00:55:51.895
You.

857
00:55:54.695 --> 00:55:56.215
Weren't we happy?

858
00:55:56.375 --> 00:55:58.815
That's the fucking problem.

859
00:56:00.535 --> 00:56:01.815
You're happy.

860
00:56:01.975 --> 00:56:03.055
Totally.

861
00:56:03.815 --> 00:56:04.975
I was happy.

862
00:56:05.575 --> 00:56:07.175
We were happy together. but...

863
00:56:08.695 --> 00:56:09.695
not anymore.

864
00:56:12.415 --> 00:56:15.015
You should've said.
We can do other things...

865
00:56:15.175 --> 00:56:18.655
- That's not the point.
- So what is?

866
00:56:18.815 --> 00:56:21.095
- I told you. it's you!
- What about me?

867
00:56:21.255 --> 00:56:23.535
It's you. you bore me!

868
00:56:27.175 --> 00:56:28.735
We had some good times.

869
00:56:29.215 --> 00:56:30.895
I had a blast with you.

870
00:56:32.575 --> 00:56:33.895
But I like change.

871
00:56:35.655 --> 00:56:36.495
See?

872
00:56:36.655 --> 00:56:39.255
I want different people.
One's not enough.

873
00:56:39.735 --> 00:56:40.695
Not for me.

874
00:56:48.375 --> 00:56:49.175
Ok.

875
00:56:50.175 --> 00:56:51.415
I came after you.

876
00:56:52.055 --> 00:56:54.095
I was into you right away.

877
00:56:55.935 --> 00:56:57.535
I thought we were the same.

878
00:56:57.935 --> 00:56:59.335
I thought you just...

879
00:56:59.495 --> 00:57:03.095
wanted to have fun
and do tons of stuff together!

880
00:57:06.015 --> 00:57:07.815
But what we do doesn't matter.

881
00:57:10.015 --> 00:57:11.015
It's me.

882
00:57:12.895 --> 00:57:14.175
It's me you want.

883
00:57:18.535 --> 00:57:20.055
And that's impossible. Alex.

884
00:57:21.935 --> 00:57:22.895
I'm sorry.

885
00:57:27.535 --> 00:57:29.055
It's too heavy for me.

886
00:57:33.535 --> 00:57:34.815
I won't be owned.

887
00:57:36.455 --> 00:57:37.655
Not by anyone.

888
00:57:39.975 --> 00:57:40.695
Ever.

889
00:57:49.455 --> 00:57:50.855
Alex. come back!

890
00:58:04.695 --> 00:58:06.295
What the hell happened?

891
00:58:09.175 --> 00:58:10.295
David?

892
00:58:11.855 --> 00:58:13.935
Alex! Are you here?

893
00:58:16.095 --> 00:58:18.495
David. what happened?

894
00:58:20.735 --> 00:58:23.815
Did you do this? Where's Alex?

895
00:58:28.895 --> 00:58:30.135
Home already?

896
00:58:30.295 --> 00:58:31.735
I'm going to my room.

897
00:59:04.095 --> 00:59:06.175
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.

898
00:59:07.095 --> 00:59:09.295
- Eating with us?
- Yeah.

899
00:59:10.055 --> 00:59:11.695
Your dad will be happy.

900
00:59:13.335 --> 00:59:16.215
<i>...speeding. missed a curve.</i>

901
00:59:16.375 --> 00:59:19.735
<i>Several witnesses were on the scene.</i>

902
00:59:19.895 --> 00:59:21.455
<i>What did you see?</i>

903
00:59:21.615 --> 00:59:23.415
<i>It seemed he was trying to fly.</i>

904
00:59:23.575 --> 00:59:25.895
<i>He must've been drunk. stoned</i>

905
00:59:26.055 --> 00:59:28.335
<i>or crazy. He had no helmet.</i>

906
00:59:28.695 --> 00:59:29.775
<i>It was shocking.</i>

907
00:59:31.415 --> 00:59:32.735
Leaving already?

908
01:00:19.135 --> 01:00:20.775
Mrs Gorman. let me in!

909
01:00:21.575 --> 01:00:23.775
- Mrs Gorman!
- Please go away.

910
01:00:24.575 --> 01:00:25.935
What happened?

911
01:00:26.455 --> 01:00:27.335
Tell me!

912
01:00:27.735 --> 01:00:29.615
- You don't know?
- No.

913
01:00:30.335 --> 01:00:32.615
David just died. My son is dead.

914
01:00:34.295 --> 01:00:35.775
You killed him.

915
01:00:36.695 --> 01:00:39.775
Get out of here
or I'll call the police.

916
01:00:41.015 --> 01:00:42.335
Disappear!

917
01:01:11.655 --> 01:01:14.055
<i>I thought: it's my fault.</i>

918
01:01:14.695 --> 01:01:17.335
<i>He died in anger. because of me.</i>

919
01:01:17.855 --> 01:01:18.775
<i>No.</i>

920
01:01:19.055 --> 01:01:21.215
<i>He was glad to be rid of me.</i>

921
01:01:21.615 --> 01:01:23.415
<i>so he rode fast to celebrate.</i>

922
01:01:23.815 --> 01:01:26.695
<i>He was finally inside
his timeless bubble.</i>

923
01:01:27.735 --> 01:01:28.935
<i>Did he dream it?</i>

924
01:01:29.495 --> 01:01:31.695
<i>Was he trying to live his dream?</i>

925
01:01:32.855 --> 01:01:34.375
<i>No. none of that.</i>

926
01:01:34.775 --> 01:01:36.095
<i>It was Kate's fault.</i>

927
01:01:38.415 --> 01:01:40.415
<i>Not that he loved her. No.</i>

928
01:01:40.575 --> 01:01:42.735
<i>He regretted being with her.</i>

929
01:01:44.535 --> 01:01:46.215
<i>He died full of remorse.</i>

930
01:01:48.655 --> 01:01:52.015
<i>I kept thinking it was all my fault.</i>

931
01:01:52.775 --> 01:01:54.895
<i>If I'd come back when he called...</i>

932
01:01:55.055 --> 01:01:56.535
<i>But did he call?</i>

933
01:01:57.815 --> 01:02:00.175
<i>I wish I'd been on the bike with him.</i>

934
01:02:03.775 --> 01:02:05.135
<i>I kept thinking.</i>

935
01:02:06.335 --> 01:02:08.455
<i>David's not dead. he can't be.</i>

936
01:02:09.735 --> 01:02:11.655
<i>I want him to still be here.</i>

937
01:02:13.255 --> 01:02:16.375
Mum's worried.
She sent me up with coffee.

938
01:02:16.895 --> 01:02:19.015
You didn't say a word last night.

939
01:02:19.415 --> 01:02:20.735
You didn't eat.

940
01:02:20.895 --> 01:02:22.695
Sorry. I'm not well.

941
01:02:23.215 --> 01:02:24.455
What is it now?

942
01:02:25.095 --> 01:02:26.375
You don't know?

943
01:02:26.735 --> 01:02:28.655
How can we? You never tell us.

944
01:02:32.095 --> 01:02:33.215
David Gorman is dead.

945
01:02:34.935 --> 01:02:36.375
The boy from the shop?

946
01:02:37.255 --> 01:02:38.055
Yes.

947
01:02:38.655 --> 01:02:40.455
Motorcycle accident.

948
01:02:46.135 --> 01:02:47.775
You hadn't known him long.

949
01:02:48.575 --> 01:02:49.935
Six weeks.

950
01:02:53.775 --> 01:02:55.215
These things happen.

951
01:02:57.935 --> 01:03:00.135
How's Mrs Gorman holding up?

952
01:03:00.735 --> 01:03:01.775
Badly.

953
01:03:03.935 --> 01:03:05.135
Only normal.

954
01:03:07.375 --> 01:03:09.055
She'll be needing help.

955
01:03:11.335 --> 01:03:13.455
You could help her in the shop.

956
01:03:13.895 --> 01:03:16.215
She was kind. paid you well.

957
01:03:16.375 --> 01:03:18.615
Show her she can count on you.

958
01:03:20.935 --> 01:03:23.055
Get up and go to work. ok?

959
01:03:26.335 --> 01:03:27.335
Good.

960
01:03:30.695 --> 01:03:33.455
If you need anything. any help...

961
01:03:34.255 --> 01:03:35.815
you know where to come.

962
01:03:38.015 --> 01:03:38.975
I'm off.

963
01:03:39.335 --> 01:03:41.015
I'll tell Mum you're coming.

964
01:04:51.535 --> 01:04:52.615
Who's there?

965
01:04:52.775 --> 01:04:53.655
Anyone?

966
01:04:54.615 --> 01:04:55.855
No. Mrs Gorman.

967
01:04:56.215 --> 01:04:57.815
It's me. Alex.

968
01:04:59.295 --> 01:05:01.975
I wanted to ask you something.

969
01:05:02.255 --> 01:05:03.455
Have you no pity?

970
01:05:04.295 --> 01:05:05.495
No decency?

971
01:05:05.895 --> 01:05:08.695
I must see David. I must see his body.

972
01:05:09.214 --> 01:05:10.615
One last time.

973
01:05:10.774 --> 01:05:12.454
It's important to me.

974
01:05:13.095 --> 01:05:14.734
I trusted you.

975
01:05:15.295 --> 01:05:17.535
Look how you paid us back.

976
01:05:18.454 --> 01:05:20.895
Please. I want to see him. I must.

977
01:05:22.654 --> 01:05:24.694
I loved him too. you know?

978
01:05:25.935 --> 01:05:28.015
How dare you say such a thing?

979
01:05:29.095 --> 01:05:31.054
He'd be alive
if he hadn't gone after you.

980
01:05:32.055 --> 01:05:34.615
Gone after me? How so?

981
01:05:35.974 --> 01:05:38.734
He told me everything.
Showed me what you broke.

982
01:05:40.815 --> 01:05:43.174
He took the bike and went to find you.

983
01:05:43.335 --> 01:05:46.015
I couldn't stop him.

984
01:05:53.655 --> 01:05:55.735
I knew my David needed a friend.

985
01:05:56.374 --> 01:05:59.215
A real friend.
I gave him his freedom.

986
01:06:00.615 --> 01:06:01.975
Look at the result.

987
01:06:02.895 --> 01:06:04.855
He's gone to join his father.

988
01:06:09.895 --> 01:06:11.575
You'll never see him again.

989
01:06:11.974 --> 01:06:13.015
You hear me?

990
01:06:13.894 --> 01:06:15.015
Never.

991
01:06:49.455 --> 01:06:52.055
<i>A sentence rang out clear as a bell.</i>

992
01:06:54.135 --> 01:06:56.455
<i>"I should die to join David."</i>

993
01:06:58.335 --> 01:06:59.535
<i>But how?</i>

994
01:07:00.455 --> 01:07:01.735
<i>Pills?</i>

995
01:07:03.215 --> 01:07:04.575
<i>Slit throat?</i>

996
01:07:05.615 --> 01:07:06.895
<i>Slit wrists?</i>

997
01:07:08.775 --> 01:07:09.855
<i>Poison?</i>

998
01:07:11.335 --> 01:07:12.655
<i>Suffocation?</i>

999
01:07:14.255 --> 01:07:15.695
<i>Hanging?</i>

1000
01:07:16.375 --> 01:07:17.695
<i>Find a firearm?</i>

1001
01:07:19.655 --> 01:07:22.815
<i>I read about a tribe
whose members could lie down</i>

1002
01:07:22.975 --> 01:07:25.215
<i>and will themselves to die.</i>

1003
01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:27.535
<i>I tried for half an hour.</i>

1004
01:07:27.695 --> 01:07:29.055
<i>It didn't work.</i>

1005
01:07:29.935 --> 01:07:31.575
<i>I'd have to take action.</i>

1006
01:07:36.655 --> 01:07:38.055
<i>Lefèvre was right.</i>

1007
01:07:38.815 --> 01:07:40.455
<i>The only way back to David</i>

1008
01:07:41.175 --> 01:07:42.335
<i>was to write.</i>

1009
01:07:42.495 --> 01:07:44.015
<i>Tell our story.</i>

1010
01:07:44.855 --> 01:07:47.495
<i>Bring him back to life with words.</i>

1011
01:07:53.495 --> 01:07:57.175
I got the hearing postponed
and told Alexis we need his text.

1012
01:07:57.335 --> 01:08:00.215
- Any news?
- Yes. he's writing all the time.

1013
01:08:00.375 --> 01:08:02.295
I think it's been therapeutic.

1014
01:08:02.455 --> 01:08:04.015
Could I read some?

1015
01:08:04.495 --> 01:08:06.895
It's too soon. we mustn't interrupt.

1016
01:08:07.055 --> 01:08:09.135
You don't have to tell him.

1017
01:08:09.295 --> 01:08:11.175
Ever heard of confidentiality?

1018
01:08:11.335 --> 01:08:13.015
Teachers have ethics too.

1019
01:08:13.175 --> 01:08:15.375
Hurry him up.
I don't need a novel.

1020
01:08:15.535 --> 01:08:20.215
Funny you say that.
He may indeed be writing one.

1021
01:08:21.055 --> 01:08:24.095
Just make sure
he's not making anything up.

1022
01:08:38.895 --> 01:08:40.055
It's terrible.

1023
01:08:40.775 --> 01:08:42.455
I can't stop crying.

1024
01:08:43.135 --> 01:08:44.375
How'd you find out?

1025
01:08:45.215 --> 01:08:47.495
I called his house and got his Mum.

1026
01:08:48.015 --> 01:08:50.095
- She's in bad shape.
- Yeah.

1027
01:08:50.895 --> 01:08:52.975
- She never wants to see me again.
- Why?

1028
01:08:53.695 --> 01:08:55.735
You and David were such good friends.

1029
01:08:57.015 --> 01:08:58.695
Not only friends.

1030
01:08:59.895 --> 01:09:02.575
What's that mean in French?

1031
01:09:05.655 --> 01:09:08.375
Does it mean more than friends?

1032
01:09:10.415 --> 01:09:12.735
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

1033
01:09:13.135 --> 01:09:14.495
You couldn't know.

1034
01:09:14.735 --> 01:09:16.295
I should've guessed.

1035
01:09:20.895 --> 01:09:22.295
Are you shocked?

1036
01:09:22.895 --> 01:09:23.695
No.

1037
01:09:24.175 --> 01:09:25.455
Just surprised.

1038
01:09:26.295 --> 01:09:28.295
Because he slept with you too.

1039
01:09:30.375 --> 01:09:31.535
You know?

1040
01:09:32.135 --> 01:09:34.135
We even fought over it.

1041
01:09:42.255 --> 01:09:44.255
Can I tell you everything. Kate?

1042
01:09:47.015 --> 01:09:48.295
Yes. I'd like that.

1043
01:09:51.215 --> 01:09:54.895
<i>Had I thought about it.
Kate would've been the last person</i>

1044
01:09:55.055 --> 01:09:56.775
<i>I'd have wanted to be with.</i>

1045
01:09:58.655 --> 01:09:59.495
<i>But in truth.</i>

1046
01:09:59.655 --> 01:10:03.935
<i>Kate was the only one
I could confide in about David and me.</i>

1047
01:10:04.455 --> 01:10:06.095
<i>So I told her everything.</i>

1048
01:10:07.655 --> 01:10:09.535
<i>Sometimes we laughed.</i>

1049
01:10:09.975 --> 01:10:12.815
<i>First time I laughed in 48 hours.</i>

1050
01:10:14.535 --> 01:10:16.695
<i>Now and then she asked a question.</i>

1051
01:10:16.975 --> 01:10:18.855
<i>Towards the end she wept.</i>

1052
01:10:19.175 --> 01:10:20.495
<i>Softly.</i>

1053
01:10:21.255 --> 01:10:22.415
<i>without a word.</i>

1054
01:10:23.095 --> 01:10:24.535
<i>and without fuss.</i>

1055
01:10:25.695 --> 01:10:28.015
I haven't told you everything. Kate.

1056
01:10:28.175 --> 01:10:29.695
I want to know everything.

1057
01:10:30.375 --> 01:10:33.615
When we met. David made me swear
that whoever died first.

1058
01:10:33.775 --> 01:10:35.655
the other would dance on his grave.

1059
01:10:35.815 --> 01:10:37.335
That's weird.

1060
01:10:37.495 --> 01:10:39.375
- I know.
- You won't do it?

1061
01:10:40.495 --> 01:10:43.535
A promise is a promise.
I have no choice.

1062
01:10:49.655 --> 01:10:51.055
Maybe you can help me.

1063
01:10:51.215 --> 01:10:52.895
- Dance?
- No. I do that.

1064
01:10:53.055 --> 01:10:54.335
Then how?

1065
01:10:54.815 --> 01:10:57.815
It may be even weirder.
but I need to see his body.

1066
01:10:57.975 --> 01:10:58.775
What?

1067
01:10:59.495 --> 01:11:01.495
I know it's crazy. but I need to.

1068
01:11:01.655 --> 01:11:03.775
To be sure he's really dead.

1069
01:11:04.495 --> 01:11:05.655
Poor Alex.

1070
01:11:06.295 --> 01:11:08.175
It wasn't just a fling.

1071
01:11:15.255 --> 01:11:16.215
Hello.

1072
01:11:18.695 --> 01:11:19.815
Hello. Alexis.

1073
01:11:19.975 --> 01:11:21.255
Hello. Mr Lefèvre.

1074
01:11:21.415 --> 01:11:23.975
So. got something I can read?

1075
01:11:24.135 --> 01:11:25.735
Yes.
I've made progress.

1076
01:11:25.895 --> 01:11:29.655
But... it's complicated.
I hope you'll like it.

1077
01:11:29.895 --> 01:11:31.775
Let's have a look.

1078
01:11:42.095 --> 01:11:43.575
Here. put these on.

1079
01:11:43.735 --> 01:11:44.815
What are they?

1080
01:11:47.215 --> 01:11:48.135
No way. never.

1081
01:11:48.295 --> 01:11:51.055
In jeans you look like a boy.
Gotta show your legs.

1082
01:11:51.215 --> 01:11:52.735
Otherwise. we shave.

1083
01:11:53.175 --> 01:11:54.735
- Being a girl sucks.
- Yep.

1084
01:11:54.895 --> 01:11:58.335
Men like girls' legs soft and hairless.

1085
01:11:58.495 --> 01:12:00.495
You can still change your mind.

1086
01:12:00.975 --> 01:12:05.215
<i>There's always a fateful moment
when you realize if you keep going.</i>

1087
01:12:05.375 --> 01:12:07.455
<i>there's no turning back.</i>

1088
01:12:08.095 --> 01:12:10.895
<i>I learned it that day. thanks to Kate.</i>

1089
01:12:11.455 --> 01:12:13.215
Would David find this sexy?

1090
01:12:13.375 --> 01:12:16.175
I don't know.
You knew him better than I did.

1091
01:12:16.335 --> 01:12:18.495
But I think you're super sexy.

1092
01:12:21.215 --> 01:12:22.415
Let's park here.

1093
01:12:29.215 --> 01:12:30.775
- Stay there.
- Ok.

1094
01:12:44.335 --> 01:12:46.295
All good! But hurry.

1095
01:12:46.455 --> 01:12:48.935
It's against the rules.
he could be fired.

1096
01:12:49.095 --> 01:12:50.095
How'd you do it?

1097
01:12:51.175 --> 01:12:53.175
His name is Bernard.
You're Susanne.

1098
01:12:53.335 --> 01:12:54.855
I hate that name!

1099
01:12:55.015 --> 01:12:56.735
It's my sister's name. C'mon.

1100
01:12:56.895 --> 01:12:58.815
Focus on your character:

1101
01:12:58.975 --> 01:13:03.575
a girl in love who wants to see
her lover's body one last time.

1102
01:13:03.735 --> 01:13:07.615
His mother forbid it.
She was against your relationship.

1103
01:13:07.775 --> 01:13:09.695
No need to play a girl for that.

1104
01:13:09.855 --> 01:13:12.455
The guard may not like
two boys in love!

1105
01:13:12.615 --> 01:13:13.975
Come on.

1106
01:13:17.575 --> 01:13:19.775
This way. girls. Quickly.

1107
01:13:23.735 --> 01:13:25.175
So very tragic.

1108
01:13:25.335 --> 01:13:27.895
Young love breaks my heart.

1109
01:13:34.935 --> 01:13:36.855
Never seen such a place?

1110
01:13:38.295 --> 01:13:39.175
No. sir.

1111
01:13:39.335 --> 01:13:41.015
I'm not allowed to do this.

1112
01:13:41.175 --> 01:13:42.335
We know.

1113
01:13:45.335 --> 01:13:46.615
She's a quiet one.

1114
01:13:46.775 --> 01:13:48.575
Susanne is devastated.

1115
01:13:48.735 --> 01:13:50.455
It's been horrible for her.

1116
01:13:50.895 --> 01:13:52.055
I understand.

1117
01:13:52.215 --> 01:13:54.815
Ever seen a corpse. Susanne dear?

1118
01:13:56.295 --> 01:13:57.775
Are you up to it?

1119
01:14:44.455 --> 01:14:46.935
<i>I can't take my eyes off that head</i>

1120
01:14:47.215 --> 01:14:49.735
<i>lying flat on the metal tray.</i>

1121
01:14:51.975 --> 01:14:53.375
<i>I wish for only one thing.</i>

1122
01:14:54.575 --> 01:14:55.935
<i>For his eyes to open.</i>

1123
01:14:57.095 --> 01:14:58.655
<i>For his mouth to speak.</i>

1124
01:14:59.695 --> 01:15:01.335
<i>For his hands to caress me.</i>

1125
01:15:02.615 --> 01:15:03.975
<i>For his heart to beat.</i>

1126
01:15:04.575 --> 01:15:07.415
<i>For his body to be him again: David.</i>

1127
01:15:11.775 --> 01:15:13.895
What's the matter with you?

1128
01:15:14.055 --> 01:15:15.615
- Get off!
- Alex!

1129
01:15:16.775 --> 01:15:17.575
Alex?

1130
01:15:18.655 --> 01:15:20.015
What on earth?

1131
01:15:34.575 --> 01:15:35.655
My god!

1132
01:15:35.815 --> 01:15:36.855
What? Oh...

1133
01:15:37.495 --> 01:15:39.055
Wearing makeup now?

1134
01:15:39.215 --> 01:15:41.935
No. a friend is putting on a play.

1135
01:15:42.655 --> 01:15:45.135
I thought you were like Uncle Jacky.

1136
01:15:45.935 --> 01:15:48.615
- Uncle Jacky?
- Your dad can't hear his name.

1137
01:15:49.135 --> 01:15:51.375
Uncle Jacky dresses like a woman?

1138
01:15:51.535 --> 01:15:53.415
Don't worry. I won't say anything.

1139
01:15:54.295 --> 01:15:56.095
Wash up before Dad...

1140
01:15:56.255 --> 01:15:58.975
Hang on. where's Uncle Jacky now?

1141
01:15:59.135 --> 01:16:01.095
Hurry. Dad'll be home soon.

1142
01:16:01.575 --> 01:16:02.495
Right.

1143
01:16:05.495 --> 01:16:06.575
Alexis?

1144
01:16:07.055 --> 01:16:07.855
Yeah?

1145
01:16:08.975 --> 01:16:10.215
Are you ok?

1146
01:16:11.175 --> 01:16:12.655
I'm fine. Mum.

1147
01:16:17.335 --> 01:16:19.735
- This really happened?
- Yes.

1148
01:16:19.895 --> 01:16:21.295
Did you exaggerate?

1149
01:16:21.455 --> 01:16:23.975
I tried to tell it
the best I could. in detail.

1150
01:16:24.935 --> 01:16:27.855
Some words were hard to find.
but I managed.

1151
01:16:28.495 --> 01:16:29.535
Indeed you did.

1152
01:16:29.695 --> 01:16:32.415
It's strange.
Since I started writing.

1153
01:16:32.575 --> 01:16:34.975
I feel like I've become
a character myself.

1154
01:16:35.135 --> 01:16:36.455
Does it scare you?

1155
01:16:36.615 --> 01:16:37.895
No. it feels good.

1156
01:16:38.055 --> 01:16:41.815
It forces me to focus less on my pain
and more on the story.

1157
01:16:41.975 --> 01:16:43.935
the characters and the writing.

1158
01:16:44.815 --> 01:16:48.815
Time to write the climax.
The caseworker and judge are waiting.

1159
01:16:48.975 --> 01:16:51.335
- The crime scene. the cemetery.
- I know.

1160
01:16:53.375 --> 01:16:55.415
That's the hardest part to tell.

1161
01:16:59.295 --> 01:17:02.135
Mind if I let Miss Martin
read some of this.

1162
01:17:02.295 --> 01:17:03.415
to reassure her?

1163
01:17:03.695 --> 01:17:05.535
- That I'm not crazy?
- Yeah.

1164
01:17:06.095 --> 01:17:07.295
If you like.

1165
01:17:11.295 --> 01:17:13.815
- Can I ask you something?
- Of course.

1166
01:17:15.135 --> 01:17:16.815
Did you know David well?

1167
01:17:17.135 --> 01:17:18.135
Yes.

1168
01:17:19.535 --> 01:17:21.095
Did he seduce you too?

1169
01:17:22.735 --> 01:17:23.735
Yes.

1170
01:17:24.375 --> 01:17:25.935
But he was a student.

1171
01:17:26.095 --> 01:17:27.615
And I was his teacher.

1172
01:18:44.815 --> 01:18:46.375
- Hello?
- <i>Mrs. Gorman?</i>

1173
01:18:46.535 --> 01:18:48.895
I realized I have no photo of David.

1174
01:18:49.055 --> 01:18:50.495
Could you give me one?

1175
01:18:51.735 --> 01:18:52.775
<i>Hello?</i>

1176
01:18:53.375 --> 01:18:54.495
<i>Are you there?</i>

1177
01:18:54.655 --> 01:18:56.855
- Hello?
- <i>Hello sir. it's Alex.</i>

1178
01:18:57.335 --> 01:18:59.095
Stop calling or we'll call the police.

1179
01:18:59.255 --> 01:19:00.975
I just need a photo...

1180
01:19:01.455 --> 01:19:02.375
Enough!

1181
01:19:02.535 --> 01:19:05.935
I see him dead!
I want to remember him alive...

1182
01:19:12.455 --> 01:19:15.055
<i>David would be buried
in a matter of days.</i>

1183
01:19:15.215 --> 01:19:18.415
<i>I needed to know
all about Jewish funeral rites.</i>

1184
01:19:18.575 --> 01:19:22.375
<i>Preparation of the body.
the wake. the burial...</i>

1185
01:19:23.175 --> 01:19:26.695
<i>I learned that they wait
at least a year after the burial</i>

1186
01:19:26.855 --> 01:19:28.615
<i>before erecting a headstone.</i>

1187
01:19:31.175 --> 01:19:33.935
<i>How will I recognize his grave?</i>

1188
01:19:50.695 --> 01:19:51.975
What're you doing?

1189
01:19:52.135 --> 01:19:53.735
Going out for air.

1190
01:19:53.895 --> 01:19:55.975
At 2 in the morning?
You'll catch cold.

1191
01:19:56.135 --> 01:19:57.855
Don't worry. I'll cover up.

1192
01:20:02.095 --> 01:20:04.055
We shouldn't have moved.

1193
01:20:05.055 --> 01:20:07.895
We were at home there.
everything was simpler.

1194
01:20:08.055 --> 01:20:10.215
We're here now. Everything's fine.

1195
01:20:10.375 --> 01:20:11.775
Go back to bed.

1196
01:20:12.255 --> 01:20:14.015
Can I make you something warm?

1197
01:20:14.175 --> 01:20:16.135
I'm not hungry. I just need air.

1198
01:20:16.295 --> 01:20:18.015
I've been in bed too long.

1199
01:20:26.095 --> 01:20:29.175
Don't go far.
You never know who might be out.

1200
01:20:29.815 --> 01:20:31.175
Go back to bed.

1201
01:20:39.255 --> 01:20:40.095
Mum?

1202
01:20:42.215 --> 01:20:43.935
Did you like Uncle Jacky?

1203
01:20:46.975 --> 01:20:48.175
Yes.

1204
01:22:47.015 --> 01:22:49.655
<i>I don't know how long the fit lasted.</i>

1205
01:22:49.815 --> 01:22:51.215
<i>I'd gone mad.</i>

1206
01:22:52.375 --> 01:22:53.815
<i>Completely mad.</i>

1207
01:22:54.935 --> 01:22:57.135
<i>What was I digging for?</i>

1208
01:22:59.535 --> 01:23:01.255
<i>Was I trying to join David?</i>

1209
01:23:01.695 --> 01:23:02.895
<i>I don't know.</i>

1210
01:23:04.615 --> 01:23:06.415
<i>But I still hadn't danced.</i>

1211
01:23:08.895 --> 01:23:09.855
Dad?

1212
01:23:10.455 --> 01:23:11.335
Yes?

1213
01:23:12.615 --> 01:23:14.935
Remember you said
to ask if I needed help?

1214
01:23:15.775 --> 01:23:16.735
Yes.

1215
01:23:18.295 --> 01:23:21.255
I need to deliver this letter.
Would you?

1216
01:23:24.295 --> 01:23:25.335
A girl?

1217
01:23:25.775 --> 01:23:26.935
A friend.

1218
01:23:27.095 --> 01:23:30.015
With my bum foot.
it's better if she comes here.

1219
01:23:30.175 --> 01:23:31.335
Is she pretty?

1220
01:23:31.895 --> 01:23:33.135
She's English.

1221
01:23:33.855 --> 01:23:35.135
A foreigner?

1222
01:23:35.815 --> 01:23:37.575
England's not in France. Dad.

1223
01:23:42.415 --> 01:23:43.735
Mind if she comes?

1224
01:23:44.215 --> 01:23:45.655
Check with your mother.

1225
01:23:46.455 --> 01:23:48.695
But will you take her my letter?

1226
01:23:49.255 --> 01:23:51.135
If it'll do you good. yes.

1227
01:23:52.415 --> 01:23:53.495
Thanks. Dad.

1228
01:23:59.375 --> 01:24:02.495
<i>Thinking back on that scene.
maybe Dad knew.</i>

1229
01:24:02.855 --> 01:24:05.375
<i>He understood David
was more than a friend.</i>

1230
01:24:06.255 --> 01:24:09.735
<i>Perhaps one day.
we'll be able to talk about it.</i>

1231
01:24:18.335 --> 01:24:19.695
I nearly didn't come.

1232
01:24:19.855 --> 01:24:21.375
- Why?
- You abandoned me

1233
01:24:21.535 --> 01:24:24.215
to that horrible man at the morgue.

1234
01:24:24.375 --> 01:24:26.535
I was half-naked. I had to run.

1235
01:24:27.535 --> 01:24:30.215
- Did he catch you?
- No. I'm much too fast.

1236
01:24:30.375 --> 01:24:31.495
So?

1237
01:24:31.655 --> 01:24:33.735
So nothing! He could have.

1238
01:24:34.095 --> 01:24:35.415
I'm sorry.

1239
01:24:36.335 --> 01:24:37.855
I regret going.

1240
01:24:38.615 --> 01:24:39.935
I forgive you.

1241
01:24:40.095 --> 01:24:43.415
Seeing you run without the wig
in a bra was funny.

1242
01:24:43.575 --> 01:24:44.655
There's something else.

1243
01:24:45.135 --> 01:24:46.295
What now?

1244
01:24:47.015 --> 01:24:49.415
I wasn't able
to dance on David's grave.

1245
01:24:50.055 --> 01:24:51.975
Well. it doesn't matter.

1246
01:24:52.135 --> 01:24:55.255
Yes it does.
I had another fit. Kate.

1247
01:24:56.055 --> 01:24:58.055
- I dug into his grave.
- What?

1248
01:24:58.215 --> 01:25:00.095
- You're crazy!
- I know.

1249
01:25:00.855 --> 01:25:03.655
I don't know why.
It was worse than the morgue.

1250
01:25:03.815 --> 01:25:05.815
- I was trying to hit him.
- Hit him?

1251
01:25:05.975 --> 01:25:07.495
And reach him.

1252
01:25:07.655 --> 01:25:10.215
I was angry. and also really sad.

1253
01:25:10.375 --> 01:25:11.775
Everything mixed together.

1254
01:25:12.575 --> 01:25:14.695
- Do you understand?
- No.

1255
01:25:15.135 --> 01:25:16.575
And yes.

1256
01:25:17.335 --> 01:25:18.735
I don't know.

1257
01:25:20.815 --> 01:25:24.255
Maybe you feel guilty about his death.

1258
01:25:27.215 --> 01:25:30.135
Mrs. Grey will wonder where I am.

1259
01:25:30.295 --> 01:25:31.215
Wait. Kate.

1260
01:25:31.495 --> 01:25:34.375
I need to talk. you do me good.
Please.

1261
01:25:40.855 --> 01:25:41.895
You know.

1262
01:25:42.375 --> 01:25:44.535
when you tell a friend the truth.

1263
01:25:45.095 --> 01:25:46.855
he resents you for life.

1264
01:25:47.415 --> 01:25:48.495
Try me.

1265
01:25:49.015 --> 01:25:51.175
You really want to know what I think?

1266
01:25:51.335 --> 01:25:52.095
Yes.

1267
01:25:54.255 --> 01:25:57.295
I think from the start
it wasn't David you loved.

1268
01:25:57.455 --> 01:25:59.935
It was your idea of David.

1269
01:26:01.735 --> 01:26:04.535
The truth is
you loved a face and a body.

1270
01:26:04.695 --> 01:26:07.255
into which you put
the person you wanted.

1271
01:26:07.735 --> 01:26:09.255
The friend of your dreams.

1272
01:26:09.735 --> 01:26:11.455
So he didn't really exist?

1273
01:26:11.615 --> 01:26:12.735
Maybe not.

1274
01:26:13.455 --> 01:26:15.175
Nonsense. David existed.

1275
01:26:15.335 --> 01:26:17.855
I was with him. I slept with him.

1276
01:26:18.015 --> 01:26:19.455
So did you.

1277
01:26:19.615 --> 01:26:21.455
Yes. someone existed.

1278
01:26:21.855 --> 01:26:23.695
But not the person we thought.

1279
01:26:25.255 --> 01:26:27.455
So we invent the people we love?

1280
01:26:27.935 --> 01:26:29.095
That's dumb.

1281
01:26:31.455 --> 01:26:32.895
I have to go.

1282
01:26:34.255 --> 01:26:35.215
You know.

1283
01:26:35.375 --> 01:26:37.935
you asked me
to tell you what I thought.

1284
01:26:38.095 --> 01:26:39.455
No problem.

1285
01:26:43.535 --> 01:26:45.815
Thanks for helping me with the morgue.

1286
01:26:45.975 --> 01:26:46.895
Really.

1287
01:26:50.815 --> 01:26:52.455
I don't understand.

1288
01:29:42.015 --> 01:29:42.935
Get him!

1289
01:29:44.175 --> 01:29:45.175
C'mon.

1290
01:29:45.775 --> 01:29:46.695
Calm down.

1291
01:29:48.135 --> 01:29:49.495
- C'mon.
- Let me go!

1292
01:29:51.455 --> 01:29:52.575
Let me go.

1293
01:29:55.655 --> 01:29:58.335
<i>That's how.
on the 2nd of September 1985.</i>

1294
01:29:58.495 --> 01:30:01.455
<i>two cops arrested
an unstable boy of sixteen.</i>

1295
01:30:04.495 --> 01:30:06.055
<i>I didn't even care.</i>

1296
01:30:07.335 --> 01:30:09.175
<i>I'd kept my promise.</i>

1297
01:30:13.935 --> 01:30:15.895
Mr. Alexis Robin. please.

1298
01:30:16.415 --> 01:30:20.175
You're here today
for damaging the grave of your friend.

1299
01:30:20.335 --> 01:30:24.055
Mr. David Gorman.
who died in a motorcycle accident

1300
01:30:24.215 --> 01:30:28.175
after you two fought over a girl
you were both courting.

1301
01:30:28.855 --> 01:30:33.415
You explained and justified
your behaviour

1302
01:30:33.575 --> 01:30:36.215
by evoking an oath
you made with the deceased.

1303
01:30:36.375 --> 01:30:40.175
But desecrating a grave.
Mr. Robin. is a crime

1304
01:30:40.615 --> 01:30:42.295
punishable by law.

1305
01:30:42.575 --> 01:30:45.175
The court hereby sentences you

1306
01:30:45.335 --> 01:30:49.655
to 140 hours of community service.

1307
01:30:49.815 --> 01:30:54.135
and strongly recommends
psychological treatment.

1308
01:30:54.295 --> 01:30:56.175
- Understood?
- Yes. your Honora.

1309
01:30:56.335 --> 01:30:57.335
The hearing is adjourned.

1310
01:32:03.895 --> 01:32:04.775
Hey!

1311
01:32:05.935 --> 01:32:06.895
Hi.

1312
01:32:07.335 --> 01:32:09.295
- Do I know you?
- Don't think so.

1313
01:32:09.575 --> 01:32:10.935
I recognize you.

1314
01:32:11.375 --> 01:32:14.455
A friend and I dragged you to the beach.
You were drunk.

1315
01:32:15.415 --> 01:32:16.255
Maybe...

1316
01:32:17.015 --> 01:32:19.335
My friend David looked after you.

1317
01:32:20.775 --> 01:32:21.935
Did you cut your hair?

1318
01:32:22.855 --> 01:32:24.655
Yeah. I was sick of it.

1319
01:32:25.575 --> 01:32:27.335
My girlfriend liked it.
but she dumped me.

1320
01:32:27.695 --> 01:32:28.495
Shit.

1321
01:32:28.655 --> 01:32:29.695
It's over now.

1322
01:32:31.295 --> 01:32:32.095
Work here?

1323
01:32:32.255 --> 01:32:34.615
For six months. after school.

1324
01:32:34.775 --> 01:32:35.615
You?

1325
01:32:35.775 --> 01:32:37.055
I start in a week.

1326
01:32:37.215 --> 01:32:40.575
Helping the old man repair boats
in the harbour.

1327
01:32:40.735 --> 01:32:41.695
Cool.

1328
01:32:49.455 --> 01:32:50.495
What are you up to?

1329
01:32:50.895 --> 01:32:51.975
Nothing special.

1330
01:32:52.375 --> 01:32:53.535
Having a smoke.

1331
01:32:53.895 --> 01:32:55.695
Want to take a boat ride?

1332
01:32:56.015 --> 01:32:58.175
I know a sweet boat. the Calypso.

1333
01:32:58.335 --> 01:32:59.295
Why not.

1334
01:32:59.455 --> 01:33:00.335
Is it yours?

1335
01:33:01.415 --> 01:33:02.575
It is now.

1336
01:33:03.135 --> 01:33:04.735
Needs some repairs.

1337
01:33:05.095 --> 01:33:06.215
I'm your man.

1338
01:33:10.135 --> 01:33:11.135
Let's go.

1339
01:33:14.055 --> 01:33:16.615
It's an orange dinghy in the harbour...

1340
01:33:22.495 --> 01:33:24.615
<i>Please don't think my story ends here.</i>

1341
01:33:25.775 --> 01:33:27.775
<i>I don't know the ending myself.</i>

1342
01:33:28.895 --> 01:33:30.895
<i>Maybe this is just the beginning.</i>

1343
01:33:32.655 --> 01:33:35.455
<i>I told you about
my summer of 85 with David.</i>

1344
01:33:35.775 --> 01:33:37.295
<i>the friend of my dreams.</i>

1345
01:33:37.575 --> 01:33:40.375
<i>so you'd understand
how I became what I am.</i>

1346
01:33:41.415 --> 01:33:43.455
<i>Or perhaps what I no longer am.</i>

1347
01:33:43.975 --> 01:33:45.975
<i>For the only thing that matters</i>

1348
01:33:46.135 --> 01:33:47.975
<i>is to somehow manage</i>

1349
01:33:48.855 --> 01:33:50.415
<i>to escape your history.</i>
