A little party

359
00:18:16.486 --> 00:18:18.314
You should stop by

360
00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.925
I'm going out

361
00:18:21.796 --> 00:18:24.277

Even better.
Tell 'em to come.

370
00:18:51.478 --> 00:18:54.698
Wait. what?
How-- how'd you know that?

371
00:18:55.656 --> 00:18:57.136
I saw you
drive past earlier.

372
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:59.660
The cabin's
the only thing out that way.

373
00:19:00.748 --> 00:19:03.794
Oh. great.
I was trippin' for a second.

374
00:19:03.968 --> 00:19:05.666
I don't-- my bad. Uh...

375
00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.886
Girl. you stalkin' me

376
00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.237
So. what time's
the party starting?

377
00:19:11.411 --> 00:19:12.716
[Eli] Well. it depends.

378
00:19:13.935 --> 00:19:15.197
What time you get off?

379
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:20.855
I like to
get off around 6:00.

380
00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:23.684
Mm. And I aim to please.

381
00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.512
6:00 it is.

382
00:19:26.034 --> 00:19:27.818
[Chloe] $37.50.

383
00:19:27.992 --> 00:19:29.690
Oh. that's it?
That's light work.

384
00:19:30.647 --> 00:19:32.040
Light work's light work.

385
00:19:32.214 --> 00:19:33.302
You know what I'm sayin'?

386
00:19:35.609 --> 00:19:37.741
Yeah. go ahead.
keep the change.

387
00:19:40.396 --> 00:19:43.791
I will see you later.
twilight eyes.

388
00:19:43.965 --> 00:19:45.836
[phone ringing]

389
00:19:46.315 --> 00:19:47.360
[door bell ringing]

390
00:19:48.491 --> 00:19:52.103
[cicadas buzzing]

391
00:20:01.504 --> 00:20:02.853
I still smell it.

392
00:20:07.336 --> 00:20:08.511
[Mark sighing]

393
00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:13.124
Maybe something died
under the cabin.

394
00:20:13.299 --> 00:20:14.300
-[growling]
-Don't say that.

395
00:20:14.474 --> 00:20:15.736
[both chuckling]

396
00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:17.172
Stupid.

397
00:20:22.656 --> 00:20:24.440
I think I know
where it's coming from.

398
00:20:26.877 --> 00:20:28.401
-Is it locked?
-Yeah.

399
00:20:28.575 --> 00:20:29.750
You don't smell it?

400
00:20:30.968 --> 00:20:32.100
A little.

401
00:20:33.014 --> 00:20:34.711
Well. spray
some of Eli's cologne.

402
00:20:34.885 --> 00:20:36.409
That'll get rid
of the smell.

403
00:20:36.583 --> 00:20:38.324
I'm not trying to make
this place smell worse.

404
00:20:38.498 --> 00:20:39.934
[Mark] Oh. yeah.
I hear you on that one.

405
00:20:40.108 --> 00:20:41.414
[Shaina chuckling]

406
00:20:43.242 --> 00:20:44.634
[Mark] Water.

407
00:20:46.332 --> 00:20:47.811
[Shaina]
We gotta jiggle it. baby.

408
00:20:49.291 --> 00:20:50.945
[both chuckling]

409
00:20:51.119 --> 00:20:52.599
[water rushing]

410
00:20:57.517 --> 00:20:59.736
Oh. that's actually good.
This-- this is well water.

411
00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:01.564
-[Shaina muttering]
-You want a sip?

412
00:21:01.738 --> 00:21:03.697
No. I'm gonna stick
to my spring water. thanks.

413
00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:06.482
You know that's actually
tap water in the bottle. right?

414
00:21:06.656 --> 00:21:07.744
I don't believe you.

415
00:21:10.791 --> 00:21:13.010
Oh. took him long enough.
Eli's back.

416
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:15.056
Yeah. well. shoot.

417
00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:16.231
at least he made it
back one piece.

418
00:21:19.016 --> 00:21:20.844
-Where you been?
-Damn. Gettin' the goods.

419
00:21:21.018 --> 00:21:22.629
Whatchu mean where I been?

420
00:21:22.803 --> 00:21:23.804
You know what it is.
you know what I'm sayin'?

421
00:21:23.978 --> 00:21:25.980
Think fast. All right.

422
00:21:26.763 --> 00:21:28.852
Yeah. see. I'm here.

423
00:21:29.026 --> 00:21:30.680
-[Eli hissing]
-Ow. asshole. that's cold.

424
00:21:30.854 --> 00:21:32.769
-Yeah. here you go.
-[Shaina] Thank you.

425
00:21:32.943 --> 00:21:34.467
[Eli] Yo.

426
00:21:34.641 --> 00:21:36.643
I met this bad shorty
at the store today. man.

427
00:21:36.817 --> 00:21:38.253
-Word.
-Word.

428
00:21:38.427 --> 00:21:39.907
I'm startin'
to feel like this town

429
00:21:40.081 --> 00:21:41.952
is full of.
like-- like. tens.

430
00:21:42.126 --> 00:21:43.127
Might need a little help with
the fashion and everything.

431
00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:44.607
but...

432
00:21:44.781 --> 00:21:45.782
might be somethin'
in the water.

433
00:21:46.566 --> 00:21:48.481
See? That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

434
00:21:48.655 --> 00:21:50.221
You sure you don't wanna
drink this water?

435
00:21:50.396 --> 00:21:52.006
I mean. we have
a straight ten on our hands.

436
00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:53.921
[Eli] What the hell
are y'all talkin' about?

437
00:21:54.095 --> 00:21:57.490
A-- anyway. so. I-- I--
I told her that. you know.

438
00:21:57.664 --> 00:21:59.970
after she get off she should.

439
00:22:00.754 --> 00:22:02.582
for a party.

440
00:22:02.756 --> 00:22:04.453
Wait. what? Wait-- we were
supposed to have a recoup day.

441
00:22:05.324 --> 00:22:07.326
It-- it is.
Whatchu talkin' about?

442
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.328
It's gonna be a nice night.

443
00:22:09.502 --> 00:22:11.155
It's not like
I'm suggesting that.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.767
you know.
we throw a rager or nothing.

445
00:22:13.941 --> 00:22:15.072
Fuck you. Eli.

446
00:22:15.246 --> 00:22:17.771
Wow.
What is wrong with her?

447
00:22:17.945 --> 00:22:19.555
I thought you-- you didn't do
your job in the shower?

448
00:22:19.729 --> 00:22:21.905
What is-- what's--
she all tense and everything.

449
00:22:22.079 --> 00:22:23.907
We're just trying to have
a peaceful night. that's all.

450
00:22:24.081 --> 00:22:25.605
-[Shaina] Mm-hmm.
-Okay. Chill.

451
00:22:25.779 --> 00:22:28.216

in here. Mark.

863
00:41:13.514 --> 00:41:15.473
-What are you talkin' about?
-This lock.

864
00:41:15.647 --> 00:41:17.170
It's flipped backwards.

865
00:41:17.344 --> 00:41:19.433
Are you sure
it wasn't like that already?

866
00:41:19.607 --> 00:41:20.826
Gimme some credit. okay?

867
00:41:21.783 --> 00:41:24.438
All right. look.
maybe it was the owner.

868
00:41:24.612 --> 00:41:26.266
Right. what if she came
when we was out?

869
00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:28.007
We weren't gone longer
than an hour.

870
00:41:28.181 --> 00:41:30.357
and did you hear any cars
coming up the driveway?

871
00:41:30.531 --> 00:41:32.272
No. baby.
I wasn't paying attention.

872
00:41:34.448 --> 00:41:36.537
Look. I mean.
Chloe's truck is gone.

873
00:41:36.711 --> 00:41:37.799
Did you hear that?

874
00:41:39.845 --> 00:41:42.412
All right. whatever.
But I don't like it.

875
00:41:42.587 --> 00:41:44.980
I don't like this place.
I don't like it here.

876
00:41:45.154 --> 00:41:47.548
I don't like not knowing
where Eli is.

877
00:41:47.722 --> 00:41:49.898
and what's
in this fuckin' pantry

878
00:41:50.072 --> 00:41:51.900
that smells so damn bad--

879
00:41:52.074 --> 00:41:53.423
All right. okay.
okay. okay. okay.

880
00:41:53.598 --> 00:41:55.034
Look. just do me
a favor.

881
00:41:55.208 --> 00:41:56.949
Calm down. Breathe.

882
00:41:57.776 --> 00:41:59.168
And this is what today

883
00:41:59.342 --> 00:42:00.126
was supposed to be
all about. right?

884
00:42:00.866 --> 00:42:02.476
We're gonna have
plenty more freakouts

885
00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:03.869
for the rest
of our lives.

886
00:42:04.696 --> 00:42:06.262
Let's not worry
about Eli.

887
00:42:07.046 --> 00:42:08.787
or the dead bodies
under the cabin.

888
00:42:08.961 --> 00:42:10.353
That's not funny.

[Mark chuckling]

890
00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:14.619
Let's just enjoy our last
few hours of peace and quiet.

891
00:42:15.924 --> 00:42:17.230
Now come have
this nightcap with me.

892
00:42:17.404 --> 00:42:18.840

Don't you see it?
There's something out there.

Babe. I don't see anything.

909
00:43:17.812 --> 00:43:19.814
Maybe it's just shadows
or somethin' playin' tricks.

910
00:43:19.988 --> 00:43:22.687
Mark. I know what I saw.
And someone is watching us.

You're not gonna

he's not picking up his phone.
so. I was just thinking.

1015
00:49:50.813 --> 00:49:53.120

00:49:53.294 --> 00:49:55.253
Yeah. yeah. yeah.
you want me to text Chloe?

1017

00:50:46.434 --> 00:50:47.957
[Taylor] Yes.
she said Eli is with her.

1036
00:50:48.132 --> 00:50:50.134
but he's really
not feeling well.

1037
00:50:50.308 --> 00:50:52.962
He's sick. so he's been
in the bathroom. I guess.

1038
00:50:54.312 --> 00:50:55.530
[Mark] I mean.
that sound about right.

1039
00:50:55.704 --> 00:50:57.184
Yeah.

1040
00:50:57.358 --> 00:50:58.794
Uh. so-- so. I mean.
what you wanna do.

1041
00:50:58.968 --> 00:51:00.144
you wanna wait for him here
or you wanna go

1042
00:51:00.318 --> 00:51:01.623
-pick him up?
-I wanna go.

1043
00:51:01.797 --> 00:51:03.016
We can find us
some cheapy hotel

1044
00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:04.496
along the way.
I don't care.

1045
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:06.759
But this place
is freaking me out.

1046
00:51:08.021 --> 00:51:09.979
All right. well. let's just
go pack up our things

1047
00:51:10.154 --> 00:51:11.459
and we'll just
get him on the way out.

1048
00:51:11.633 --> 00:51:12.678
Okay.

1049
00:51:14.027 --> 00:51:15.115
Is everything all right?

1050
00:51:15.681 --> 00:51:17.117
[Shaina] Yeah. it's just--

1051
00:51:17.291 --> 00:51:18.597
I'm not used to
all this peace and quiet.

1052
00:51:18.771 --> 00:51:19.946
It's just--

1053
00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:21.600
it's kind of making me crazy.

1054
00:51:21.774 --> 00:51:23.558
and so I think
we're just gonna cut this short

1055
00:51:23.732 --> 00:51:24.646
and go home
a little early.

1056
00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:26.257
Mm. okay.

1057
00:51:26.431 --> 00:51:27.562
[knocking on door]

1058
00:51:29.477 --> 00:51:30.826
Are you guys
expecting someone?

1059
00:51:33.481 --> 00:51:34.569
No.

1060
00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:41.010
[door creaks open]

1061
00:51:43.665 --> 00:51:44.840
[Wingrad] Howdy. folks.

1062
00:51:45.014 --> 00:51:46.364
I'm Sherriff Wingrad.

1063
00:51:47.191 --> 00:51:49.236
I heard there was a disturbance
out here this evening.

1064
00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:51.195
Yeah. yeah. that--
that was me.

1065
00:51:55.634 --> 00:51:57.114
Taylor.
what are you doing here?

1066
00:51:58.289 --> 00:51:59.725
I was hangin' out with Chloe.

1067
00:52:00.291 --> 00:52:01.944
Did she ditch you again?

1068
00:52:03.642 --> 00:52:04.817
When are you
gonna learn that girl

1069
00:52:04.991 --> 00:52:06.166
only has
one thing on her mind?

1070
00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:07.298
[Taylor] I know.

1071
00:52:07.472 --> 00:52:09.430
[eerie music plays]

1072
00:52:09.604 --> 00:52:11.867
All right.
What seems to be the problem?

1073
00:52:13.173 --> 00:52:14.696
Um...

1074
00:52:15.610 --> 00:52:17.351
somebody's been
messin' with us.

1075
00:52:17.525 --> 00:52:18.700
Messin' how?

1076
00:52:19.788 --> 00:52:21.790
Somebody was
watching us down by the fire.

1077
00:52:23.096 --> 00:52:24.315
All right.

1078
00:52:24.489 --> 00:52:25.881
Can you
describe 'em for me?

1079
00:52:27.448 --> 00:52:30.147
It was dark.
and I only got a glimpse.

1080
00:52:32.279 --> 00:52:33.411
What about you?

1081
00:52:34.455 --> 00:52:36.849
Well. no. I mean.

1082
00:52:37.023 --> 00:52:39.243
I actually--
I didn't see anything.

1083
00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:45.988
So. you think you saw
somebody but you can't be sure.

1084
00:52:47.555 --> 00:52:48.948
Mark. why don't you tell her

1085
00:52:49.122 --> 00:52:50.558
about what you saw
down at the lake?

1086
00:52:54.388 --> 00:52:55.955
It's probably best
if I show you.

1087
00:52:58.958 --> 00:53:00.046
Lead the way.

1088
00:53:01.221 --> 00:53:02.962
Taylor. do you think
you can keep an eye

1089
00:53:03.136 --> 00:53:04.616
on that young lady
while we're gone?

1090
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:07.009
Yeah. not like I have
anywhere else to be.

1091
00:53:07.749 --> 00:53:09.055
All right.

1092
00:53:09.229 --> 00:53:10.883
Lock the door behind us.
just to be safe.

1093
00:53:13.277 --> 00:53:14.321
All right. let's go.

1094
00:53:16.541 --> 00:53:17.585
What'd I miss?

1095
00:53:27.639 --> 00:53:28.683
Look. It was...

1096
00:53:30.207 --> 00:53:31.251
it was over here.

1097
00:53:33.514 --> 00:53:35.516
[mysterious music plays]

1098
00:53:36.778 --> 00:53:37.823
Hey. watch it. watch it.

1099
00:53:42.654 --> 00:53:43.698
What am I lookin' for?

1100
00:53:44.656 --> 00:53:46.658
I-- I came down to get water

1101
00:53:46.832 --> 00:53:48.312
to-- to put out the fire.
okay. and...

1102
00:53:49.661 --> 00:53:51.228
I'm tellin' you.
it was a noise.

1103
00:53:51.402 --> 00:53:52.838
or a splash
or somethin'.

1104
00:53:53.012 --> 00:53:55.188
and I shine my light
and it was right there.

1105
00:53:55.362 --> 00:53:56.668
It was a fuckin' hand.

1106
00:53:56.842 --> 00:53:59.540
[eerie chanting]

1107
00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:02.369
I notice you kids
are having a little party

1108
00:54:02.543 --> 00:54:03.588
back in the cabin.

1109
00:54:04.589 --> 00:54:05.764
You take any drugs?

1110
00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:08.506
I mean. I had
a couple beers. all right?

1111
00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:11.552
But-- I know it sounds crazy.
but I know what I saw.

1112
00:54:11.726 --> 00:54:13.162
It was
a severed hand in the water.

1113
00:54:13.337 --> 00:54:14.773
[Wingrad] Okay. relax now.

1114
00:54:14.947 --> 00:54:16.644
I'm not trying
to bust you. I'm just

1115
00:54:16.818 --> 00:54:18.907
trying to figure out
what it is you really saw.

1116
00:54:19.081 --> 00:54:22.737
[eerie chanting]

1117
00:54:28.090 --> 00:54:29.178
Oh. shit.

1118
00:54:30.919 --> 00:54:32.007
Yo...

1119
00:54:33.313 --> 00:54:34.445
Fuck.

1120
00:54:37.012 --> 00:54:38.362
[sighs]

1121
00:54:38.536 --> 00:54:39.711
Do you wear
glasses or contacts?

1122
00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:43.192
When I read. yeah.

1123
00:54:43.367 --> 00:54:45.760
And did you
have 'em in earlier?

1124
00:54:46.979 --> 00:54:49.111
-No.
-[Taylor] Okay.

1125
00:54:49.286 --> 00:54:51.592

that they're gonna head back

good enough to ride in her car

Fuckin' asshole.

00:54:56.728 --> 00:54:58.033
Uh. in his defense.
no one ever says no to Chloe.

1130
00:54:58.207 --> 00:54:59.905
I could see that.

1131
00:55:00.079 --> 00:55:01.907
Eli made a joke that it must be
something in the water.

1132
00:55:03.082 --> 00:55:04.823
It's more like
a limited gene pool.

1133
00:55:04.997 --> 00:55:06.346
Everyone in Shady Grove
is related.

1134
00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:08.087
which makes
dating a nightmare.

1135
00:55:08.261 --> 00:55:09.871
It's also
really hard to stand out

1136
00:55:10.045 --> 00:55:11.612
when everyone
looks the exact same.

1137
00:55:12.439 --> 00:55:13.919
It's why I got the ink.
To stand out.

-Do you wanna see?
-Sure.

-[peaceful music plays]
-Check it out.

1140
00:55:29.282 --> 00:55:31.458
[Shaina] Oh. my God.
It's amazing.

1141
00:55:32.677 --> 00:55:34.026
[Taylor] I mean.
that's what everyone tells me.

1142
00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:35.375
but I can't really
see it for myself.

1143
00:55:37.116 --> 00:55:38.465
How long did it take?

1144
00:55:41.076 --> 00:55:42.643
Took about a year. on and off.

1145
00:55:42.817 --> 00:55:44.428
Basically whenever
I had money to pay for it.

1146
00:55:45.167 --> 00:55:46.908
[Shaina] It looks painful.
Did it hurt?

1147
00:55:47.822 --> 00:55:51.348
Not really. I mean.
it's kind of the point. right?

1148
00:55:51.522 --> 00:55:53.219
Yeah. I guess.

1149
00:55:54.002 --> 00:55:55.134
Do you have any tattoos?

1150
00:55:55.308 --> 00:55:56.657
Yeah. just this little...

1151
00:55:59.878 --> 00:56:01.662
I actually
got it with Eli.

1152
00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:06.101
It's so cute.

1153
00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:09.496
[Shaina] Mark used to
have this really tiny coupe.

1154
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:12.673
Um. and I'm-- mind you.
I'm super claustrophobic.

1155
00:56:12.847 --> 00:56:14.632
so I refused
to sit in the back.

1156
00:56:14.806 --> 00:56:16.634
and Eli
had to every single time.

1157
00:56:16.808 --> 00:56:18.679
And so. he used to kick the
back of the seat and scream.

1158
00:56:18.853 --> 00:56:20.986
"Oh. Shaina needs
to spread her wings."

1159
00:56:21.813 --> 00:56:23.423
Now. I know
that he was making fun of me.

1160
00:56:23.597 --> 00:56:24.990
but it kinda stuck.

1161
00:56:25.164 --> 00:56:27.732
-Like. literally.
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1162
00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:30.561
Do you remember seein' a farm

1163
00:56:30.735 --> 00:56:32.214
that you passed
on the way here?

1164
00:56:33.607 --> 00:56:35.435
Yes. what-- why?

1165
00:56:35.609 --> 00:56:37.829
Yeah. well.
that's the Hilton boys' farm.

1166
00:56:38.003 --> 00:56:40.571
We've been
gettin' complaints for years

1167
00:56:40.745 --> 00:56:43.095
about their improper
disposal of livestock.

1168
00:56:43.269 --> 00:56:46.011
Sometimes they just
pile 'em up

1169
00:56:46.185 --> 00:56:47.926
in a big pile
and burn 'em.

1170
00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:50.842
Causing a funk
you would not believe.

1171
00:56:51.016 --> 00:56:53.801
Other times.
they'll just chop up the bits

1172
00:56:53.975 --> 00:56:55.586
and toss 'em
right in there.

1173
00:56:57.718 --> 00:57:00.199
The-- well.
I don't know. all right?

1174
00:57:00.373 --> 00:57:02.201
Maybe. I-- maybe.

1175
00:57:03.289 --> 00:57:05.204
Look.
you are not the first person

1176
00:57:05.378 --> 00:57:07.511
who's called
in a panic because some

1177
00:57:07.685 --> 00:57:10.862

have washed up to shore.

00:57:13.908 --> 00:57:16.171
certainly not
rocket scientists.

for a second.

I'm gonna
ask you one more time...

1186
00:57:39.368 --> 00:57:40.457
are you on somethin'?

1187
00:57:40.631 --> 00:57:41.849
No.

back to the cabin.

Did you
and Eli ever hook up?

No. God. no.

00:57:58.431 --> 00:57:59.780
He is not my type.

-And your boyfriend is--
-More my type?

-Oh.
-[Shaina] Yeah.

1199
00:58:06.047 --> 00:58:07.484
-Nice.
-Mm-hmm.

1203
00:58:14.534 --> 00:58:15.579
[Shaina] Wait...

1204
00:58:17.537 --> 00:58:18.799
how did you
know to do that?

1205
00:58:18.973 --> 00:58:20.018
Jiggle it?

1206
