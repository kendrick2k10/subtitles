00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.272

6

7
00:01:52.286 --> 00:01:54.655

<i>after my roommates left.</i>

9
00:01:57.589 --> 00:02:01.322

10
00:02:01.358 --> 00:02:04.393

00:04:53.932 --> 00:04:55.961
Um...

49
00:04:55.996 --> 00:04:59.106
I was gonna wait

50
00:04:59.141 --> 00:05:01.074
Oh. okay. yeah.
that sounds about right.

51
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.339
I like it.
Christmas in January.

52
00:05:03.374 --> 00:05:04.670
-Thank you.

53
00:05:04.705 --> 00:05:06.243

-Okay. yeah.

54
00:05:06.278 --> 00:05:07.975

-Mm-hmm.

55
00:05:09.717 --> 00:05:11.011
Hey.

56
00:05:11.983 --> 00:05:13.019
What?

57
00:05:13.054 --> 00:05:14.617
I asked if anybody wanted any.

58
00:05:14.653 --> 00:05:17.182
I just wanted a little.
Don't be so defensive.

59
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.989
Defensive.

60
00:05:20.024 --> 00:05:21.292
Scooch!

61
00:05:21.328 --> 00:05:22.621
Um. there's just not
really room.

62
00:05:22.657 --> 00:05:23.795
Oh. okay.
Do you mind?

63
00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:27.132
Oh. what. is this
not comfortable?

64
00:05:27.168 --> 00:05:29.499
-How about this?
-Oh. okay. sure.

65
00:05:29.534 --> 00:05:31.334
-It's your funeral.
-Oh!

66
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.371
-Stop!
-There are feet on me...

67
00:05:33.406 --> 00:05:34.534
-No. I can't-- you know I can't.
-Mm-hmm.

68
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:35.769
...that belong to Amanda.

69
00:05:35.804 --> 00:05:37.008
Do you think you're
gonna survive?

70
00:05:37.043 --> 00:05:38.635
-Um. no.
-Yeah?

71
00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:40.138
-Yeah?
-No.

72
00:05:40.174 --> 00:05:41.948

We're here for you.

100

I just-- I don't wanna do this.

101
00:07:35.423 --> 00:07:36.530
I know.

102
00:07:40.593 --> 00:07:41.898
Hey.

103
00:07:42.763 --> 00:07:44.500
We can do this.
Okay?

104

No one here is getting COVID.

105
00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:48.575
I simply won't allow it.

106
00:07:51.303 --> 00:07:54.146
Yeah. it's all about
the mindset. right?

107
00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:56.345
Just have to manifest it.

108
00:07:56.381 --> 00:07:57.675
I mean. we're in LA.

109
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:05.053
I think I could maybe
survive COVID.

110
00:08:07.157 --> 00:08:10.157
I think we
can do better than maybe.

<i> Hey. honey.</i>
<i>Are you busy right now?</i>

117
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.960
I haven't been busy in months.

Oh. my God.

120
00:08:49.865 --> 00:08:51.699
You found a cure
for Coronavirus.

121
00:08:51.734 --> 00:08:54.163
Mom. have you notified The Post?

122
00:08:54.199 --> 00:08:56.706
<i> Ha-ha.</i>
<i>No!</i>

123
00:08:56.741 --> 00:08:58.178
<i>But you know I would</i>

<i>anything to keep you safe.</i>

125
00:09:00.743 --> 00:09:02.644

126
00:09:02.679 --> 00:09:04.344
<i>Something to fill your time.</i>

127
00:09:04.379 --> 00:09:07.481
<i> Wow. that took her all</i>

128
00:09:07.517 --> 00:09:09.150
<i>New record.</i>

129
00:09:11.356 --> 00:09:12.557
Yeah. I know.

130
00:09:12.592 --> 00:09:14.020
It's just that jobs
aren't exactly

131
00:09:14.055 --> 00:09:16.558
flying off the shelves
right now. so...

132
00:09:16.594 --> 00:09:18.564
<i> Right.</i>
<i>Well...</i>

133
00:09:18.599 --> 00:09:20.425
<i>What are you gonna do</i>

134
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.834
I don't know.

135
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.367
It's just-- it's the end
of the world right now.

136
00:09:28.402 --> 00:09:30.572
The world is literally ending.
and no one is really

137
00:09:30.607 --> 00:09:32.811
thinking long-term so...

138
00:09:34.743 --> 00:09:37.248
<i>The world's not ending.</i>

139
00:09:37.283 --> 00:09:38.880
<i>It's on pause.</i>

140
00:09:38.916 --> 00:09:41.516
<i>And so is your ambition.</i>
<i>apparently.</i>

141
00:09:41.552 --> 00:09:42.851
<i>How's your health?</i>

142
00:09:42.886 --> 00:09:44.090
<i>I know you've been</i>
<i>staying safe.</i>

143
00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:45.690
<i>which is great.</i>

144
00:09:45.726 --> 00:09:47.794
<i>I'm already anxious enough</i>
<i>thinking of what</i>

145
00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:50.560
<i>CF is doing to your lungs</i>
<i>without COVID in the mix.</i>

146
00:09:50.596 --> 00:09:52.932
<i>But are you feeling all right?</i>

147
00:09:52.968 --> 00:09:55.029
I'm fine.

148
00:09:55.065 --> 00:09:56.528
<i> Have you been doing</i>

149
00:09:56.564 --> 00:09:58.299
Yep.

150
00:09:58.334 --> 00:10:00.463
<i> Do they still have you</i>
<i>on the inhaled albuterol?</i>

151
00:10:00.499 --> 00:10:02.641
<i>Because I remember</i>
<i>your doctor saying that</i>

152
00:10:02.676 --> 00:10:04.773
<i>that really helps to get</i>
<i>all the mucus up</i>

153
00:10:04.809 --> 00:10:06.613
<i>when you do it</i>
<i>with the vest.</i>

154
00:10:06.648 --> 00:10:08.371
<i>Gotta imagine that's</i>
<i>more important than ever</i>

155
00:10:08.406 --> 00:10:10.382
<i>since you're so inactive</i>
<i>nowadays.</i>

156
00:10:10.418 --> 00:10:12.048
<i>With so much free time. honey.</i>

157
00:10:12.083 --> 00:10:15.581
<i>your health really should be</i>
<i>your top priority.</i>

158
00:10:15.616 --> 00:10:19.616
<i>I know it's. like. weird times</i>
<i>right now and everything...</i>

159
00:10:19.651 --> 00:10:22.327
<i> Sometimes. I feel</i>
<i>like I'm patient first</i>

160
00:10:22.362 --> 00:10:24.357
<i>and daughter second.</i>

161
00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:30.831
<i>Her nagging just makes me</i>

162
00:10:30.866 --> 00:10:32.672
<i>wanna do my treatments less.</i>

163
00:10:32.707 --> 00:10:35.806
<i>Even when she's a four-hour</i>
<i>plane ride away.</i>

164
00:10:35.841 --> 00:10:37.574
<i>I know they're important.</i>
<i>or whatever.</i>

165
00:10:37.609 --> 00:10:39.842
<i>but it's not like I'm gonna die</i>

166
00:10:39.877 --> 00:10:43.443
<i>if I don't do them</i>
<i>for a few days.</i>

167
00:10:43.478 --> 00:10:45.846
<i>It's hard to be proactive</i>
<i>when it doesn't feel like</i>

168
00:10:45.881 --> 00:10:48.150
<i>there's any future to plan for.</i>

169
00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:20.013
Shit. shit.
shit. shit. shit.

170
00:11:20.049 --> 00:11:22.283
Holy fuck.
Are you waving at me?

171
00:11:23.348 --> 00:11:25.015
What am I doing?
What am I doing?

172
00:11:25.051 --> 00:11:27.150
Why am I doing that?

173
00:11:27.186 --> 00:11:29.092
Why am I waving like that?

174
00:11:37.205 --> 00:11:38.733
<i>Oh. my God. hi!</i>

175
00:11:38.768 --> 00:11:41.705
<i>Wee!</i>
<i>Oh. my gosh!</i>

176
00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.410
<i>-I've missed your face.</i>
-Aww.

177
00:11:44.445 --> 00:11:46.476
I miss you.
I miss everyone.

178
00:11:46.511 --> 00:11:47.743
I miss everything.

179
00:11:47.778 --> 00:11:49.977
<i>I mean. I even miss Tyler.</i>

180
00:11:50.012 --> 00:11:52.046
<i>-Don't kill me. okay?</i>
-Okay.

181
00:11:52.081 --> 00:11:53.419
We might be getting
back together.

182
00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:58.588
Okay!
Honestly...

183
00:11:58.624 --> 00:12:00.392
Get it where you can. sis.

184
00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:01.660
I can't even hate on you.

185
00:12:01.695 --> 00:12:03.726
The last time--
I can't even recall

186
00:12:03.761 --> 00:12:05.488
the last time I've been touched.

187
00:12:05.523 --> 00:12:08.194
even non-sexually.
by another person.

188
00:12:08.229 --> 00:12:10.903
<i> You're being</i>
that<i> strict?</i>

189
00:12:11.604 --> 00:12:14.266
Yeah.
What are you doing?

190
00:12:14.302 --> 00:12:17.335
-<i> I mean. nothing crazy.</i>
-Mm-hmm.

191
00:12:17.371 --> 00:12:19.108
<i>Julia and Miguel come</i>
<i>over a lot.</i>

192
00:12:19.144 --> 00:12:21.907
<i>Sometimes. I hang out</i>
<i>with Steph and Trish.</i>

193
00:12:21.942 --> 00:12:24.416
<i>Oh. and Jackson.</i>

194
00:12:24.451 --> 00:12:26.711
<i>And. of course. Tyler.</i>

195
00:12:26.747 --> 00:12:28.116
Mm.

196
00:12:28.151 --> 00:12:30.887
<i> Look-- I--</i>
<i>I wanna do my part</i>

197
00:12:30.923 --> 00:12:32.623
<i>to. like. stop</i>
<i>the spreading stuff.</i>

198
00:12:32.658 --> 00:12:34.726
<i>but I feel like we're young;</i>

199
00:12:34.761 --> 00:12:37.790
<i>we can afford</i>
<i>a few more risks.</i>

200
00:12:37.825 --> 00:12:39.397
Yeah. pfft.

201
00:12:39.432 --> 00:12:41.093
We-- I mean. yeah.

202
00:12:41.129 --> 00:12:43.096
Like. we're young.

203
00:12:43.132 --> 00:12:44.968
<i>My friend's mom.</i>
<i>she has cancer.</i>

204
00:12:45.003 --> 00:12:48.370
<i>so imagine what she</i>
<i>has to go through.</i>

205
00:12:48.405 --> 00:12:51.205
<i>-I mean. she can't see</i>
<i>absolutely anybody...</i>

206
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.846
<i>-She has to...</i>

207
00:12:56.814 --> 00:12:58.148
Terese?

208
00:12:59.253 --> 00:13:00.410
Uh. yeah.

209
00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:02.718
I guess we need
some house rules.

210
00:13:02.753 --> 00:13:04.583
What are you thinkin'?

211
00:13:04.619 --> 00:13:07.150
Uh. well. everything they're
recommending to the public

212
00:13:07.186 --> 00:13:08.958
but to the extreme.

213
00:13:08.993 --> 00:13:11.264
Like. I don't wanna
take any risks.

214
00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.226
What does that mean?

215
00:13:13.261 --> 00:13:15.400
Don't go anywhere.
don't see anyone.

216
00:13:15.436 --> 00:13:17.128
increased hygiene...

217
00:13:17.163 --> 00:13:18.595
We can't leave?

218
00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:21.072
Unless it's absolutely.
completely necessary.

219
00:13:24.842 --> 00:13:27.045
Well. what counts as necessary?

220
00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.749
Where are you trying to go?

221
00:13:29.784 --> 00:13:31.885
Everything is either cancelled
or closed.

222
00:13:33.281 --> 00:13:35.684
Well. how long
is this gonna last?

223
00:13:35.719 --> 00:13:37.550
How should I know?

224
00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:46.826
Have you thought
about going home?

225
00:13:46.861 --> 00:13:48.500
No.
No.

226
00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:50.865
I'd go crazy with my mom.

227
00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.402
I am...
Going home.

228
00:13:54.138 --> 00:13:56.508
My mom doesn't want me
staying in the city.

229
00:13:56.543 --> 00:13:57.909
I know. dude.
Same.

230
00:13:57.944 --> 00:14:00.843
My mom was texting me. like.
25 times<i> today.</i>

231
00:14:00.878 --> 00:14:03.981
Wait. so we're just on lockdown?

232
00:14:04.016 --> 00:14:06.348
Like. I can't even go see
my boyfriend?

233
00:14:07.183 --> 00:14:09.383
I mean. we can factor
Zack in as well.

234
00:14:09.419 --> 00:14:12.550
But I don't think anyone
should be going in or out.

235
00:14:12.585 --> 00:14:15.321
So what. I'm like a prisoner
in this house.

236
00:14:15.356 --> 00:14:17.793
and I can't even see
my boyfriend?

237
00:14:17.828 --> 00:14:20.124
I'm just saying for now.

238
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.960
Until we know more.

239
00:14:22.996 --> 00:14:24.237
Please...

240
00:14:24.273 --> 00:14:26.833
Well. how long?

241
00:14:26.869 --> 00:14:28.640
I don't know.

242
00:14:28.675 --> 00:14:30.968
I don't know. and I wish I did.

243
00:14:31.003 --> 00:14:32.440
I do.

244
00:14:33.842 --> 00:14:35.077
But I don't.

245
00:14:35.112 --> 00:14:37.374
Well. if you're gonna
be like that.

246
00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:39.377
then I obviously
can't stay here.

247
00:14:39.413 --> 00:14:42.249
Um. maybe I can go stay
with Zack.

248
00:14:42.284 --> 00:14:44.551
This is not about
how I'm gonna be.

249
00:14:45.285 --> 00:14:47.057
This is what I have to do.

250
00:14:47.093 --> 00:14:49.594
This pandemic means way
different things for me

251
00:14:49.629 --> 00:14:51.756
than it does for you.

252
00:14:53.529 --> 00:14:56.497
Well. the world doesn't revolve
around you. Terese.

253
00:15:06.712 --> 00:15:08.509
I don't want it to.

254
00:15:21.658 --> 00:15:23.119
Oh. God.

255
00:15:23.154 --> 00:15:24.364
Amanda?

256
00:15:24.399 --> 00:15:26.456
-Hey!
-Hey!

257
00:15:26.492 --> 00:15:28.598
What are you doing here?

258
00:15:28.634 --> 00:15:31.070
Um. I live here.

259
00:15:31.105 --> 00:15:33.765
Except you haven't lived here
for. like. a while now.

260
00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.834
Well. I still pay rent.

261
00:15:37.808 --> 00:15:40.437
Right.

262
00:15:40.472 --> 00:15:42.609
Uh. how are you and Zack doing?

263
00:15:43.675 --> 00:15:46.784
Uh. it's been better.
We just...

264
00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.381
needed a little break.
close quarters and all.

265
00:15:50.416 --> 00:15:52.650
Yeah. I'm sorry to hear that.

266
00:15:52.686 --> 00:15:54.654
Oh. it's no big deal.
We'll get through it.

267
00:15:57.096 --> 00:15:58.797
So why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

268
00:16:00.629 --> 00:16:03.630
Sorry. I didn't know
I needed to ask permission.

269
00:16:07.605 --> 00:16:09.234
Um...

270
00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:12.474
You've really nested here.

271
00:16:14.544 --> 00:16:16.506
Yeah. well. a little heads up
would have been nice.

272
00:16:16.542 --> 00:16:19.547
-I would have cleaned.
-Mm-hmm.

273
00:16:25.651 --> 00:16:27.789
<i>This should be interesting.</i>

274
00:16:33.563 --> 00:16:36.297
<i>I mean. how can she</i>
<i>just come back?</i>

275
00:16:36.332 --> 00:16:38.872
<i>Like things are</i>
<i>any different now.</i>

276
00:16:38.907 --> 00:16:40.368
<i>I guess I have</i>
<i>to give her a chance.</i>

277
00:16:40.403 --> 00:16:41.940
<i>It's not like I can</i>
<i>just kick her out.</i>

278
00:16:41.975 --> 00:16:44.701
<i>but I don't know</i>
<i>where she's been.</i>

279
00:16:44.737 --> 00:16:46.109
<i>She could have been</i>
<i>playing beer die</i>

280
00:16:46.144 --> 00:16:49.039
<i>with Zack's bros.</i>
<i>for all I know.</i>

281
00:16:49.075 --> 00:16:51.717
<i>Although beer die is probably</i>
<i>the easiest drinking game</i>

282
00:16:51.752 --> 00:16:53.316
<i>to social distance during.</i>

283
00:16:53.352 --> 00:16:58.058
<i>But-- </i> <i> -- still.</i>
<i>I don't like this.</i>

284
00:16:59.826 --> 00:17:01.626
I just love Julianne Moore.

285
00:17:01.661 --> 00:17:04.323
She was so pretty.

286
00:17:04.358 --> 00:17:06.726
I mean. she's still beautiful.

287
00:17:08.097 --> 00:17:09.635
Yeah. but not like this.

288
00:17:09.671 --> 00:17:11.236
That's kind of fucked up.

289
00:17:11.271 --> 00:17:15.033
That's like the ageist bullshit
Hollywood always spins.

290
00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:16.439
Whatever.

291
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:23.472
Ope. she's gonna die.

292
00:17:23.508 --> 00:17:25.414
What?
Spoilers!

293
00:17:25.449 --> 00:17:28.484
I have never seen this movie
before in my life.

294
00:17:28.519 --> 00:17:31.056
All I'm saying is when
a character coughs in a movie.

295
00:17:31.091 --> 00:17:32.650
it's foreshadowing that
they're gonna. like.

296
00:17:32.685 --> 00:17:34.952
die of cancer. or AIDS.
or something.

297
00:17:36.087 --> 00:17:38.422
As if the first sign of cancer
or AIDS is a cough--

298
00:17:38.458 --> 00:17:40.496
Shh-- I'm trying to watch.

299
00:17:55.248 --> 00:17:57.609
<i> It's a pretty</i>
<i>foolproof system.</i>

300
00:17:57.644 --> 00:18:01.087
<i>If a character coughs.</i>
<i>they die.</i>

301
00:18:01.123 --> 00:18:03.414
<i>Maybe that's why people</i>
<i>are always so concerned</i>

302
00:18:03.449 --> 00:18:05.718
<i>when I causally cough.</i>

303
00:18:05.753 --> 00:18:08.590
<i>It's been subconsciously</i>
<i>ingrained into them</i>

304
00:18:08.625 --> 00:18:11.527
<i>that it means I'm gonna. like.</i>
<i>die or something.</i>

305
00:18:12.659 --> 00:18:16.268
<i>And I am. but not.</i>
<i>like. soon...</i>

306
00:18:17.438 --> 00:18:18.736
<i>I think.</i>

307
00:18:47.529 --> 00:18:48.831
Don't you think
that's kind of creepy?

308
00:18:48.867 --> 00:18:50.770
Jesus. Amanda!

309
00:18:50.805 --> 00:18:53.371
Just saying.
You're drooling.

310
00:18:55.106 --> 00:18:56.237
You should shoot your shot.

311
00:18:56.272 --> 00:18:57.604
Oh. my God.
It's a pandemic.

312
00:18:57.639 --> 00:18:59.836
I can't just go around
dating random dudes.

313
00:18:59.871 --> 00:19:01.907
You could do it
from a distance.

314
00:19:01.942 --> 00:19:04.916
Oh. my God. it would be
like<i> Five Feet Apart.</i>

315
00:19:04.951 --> 00:19:06.846
Okay. that's really insensitive.

316
00:19:06.881 --> 00:19:09.984
And also. no it wouldn't
because he doesn't have CF.

317
00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.224
How do you know?

318
00:19:12.455 --> 00:19:16.328
Because it would just be
way too ironic.

319
00:19:18.997 --> 00:19:20.359
Where are you going?

320
00:19:20.394 --> 00:19:22.327
Just getting a coffee.

321
00:19:22.363 --> 00:19:23.998
Do you have a mask?

322
00:19:24.034 --> 00:19:25.965
Duh!
Look.

323
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.108
All I'm saying is if you're
so starved for a relationship.

324
00:19:29.143 --> 00:19:31.141
you have the perfect
potential man gardening

325
00:19:31.177 --> 00:19:32.537
on the other side
of this duplex.

326
00:19:32.572 --> 00:19:34.609
-Whatever!

327
00:19:34.644 --> 00:19:37.343
And also. I'm not starved
for a relationship.

328
00:19:37.378 --> 00:19:39.112
I just want some dick!

329
00:19:43.652 --> 00:19:45.522
God. I really hope
he didn't hear that.

330
00:19:47.728 --> 00:19:48.921
Then again...

331
00:20:01.005 --> 00:20:02.737
-Hey.
-Hey!

332
00:20:06.738 --> 00:20:09.645
So. um. I think just maybe

333
00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:13.484
we should be. um. limiting
how much we're going out.

334
00:20:14.779 --> 00:20:16.751
I mean. I just got a coffee.

335
00:20:18.123 --> 00:20:20.554
For the third time this week.

336
00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:22.559
Terese. don't worry.
I'm being careful.

337
00:20:23.857 --> 00:20:27.124
Okay. can you just wash
your hands please?

338
00:20:28.234 --> 00:20:30.366
Yeah. I was going to.
I just got home.

339
00:20:30.401 --> 00:20:32.734
Just give me the chance to.
Okay?

340
00:20:38.941 --> 00:20:41.444
<i> She barely even told me</i>
<i>she was coming back.</i>

341
00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:45.051
and the reason she left
hasn't changed at all.

342
00:20:45.086 --> 00:20:47.018
And I feel like
I'm gonna get COVID.

343
00:20:47.053 --> 00:20:49.055
and it's gonna be all her fault.

344
00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:52.352
<i>Ooh. okay.</i>
<i>That's a little extreme.</i>

345
00:20:53.055 --> 00:20:55.092
Yeah. I can't help but
feel she's being irresponsible

346
00:20:55.127 --> 00:20:57.262
and she's going outside though.

347
00:20:57.297 --> 00:21:00.525
<i>But you can't know</i>
<i>how she's acting.</i>

348
00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.268
Exactly.
That's my issue.

349
00:21:02.304 --> 00:21:05.303
I feel like I've lost
all control with her back.

350
00:21:05.339 --> 00:21:08.636
<i>Well. I know how you like</i>
<i>your control.</i>

351
00:21:08.671 --> 00:21:11.443
<i>Have you tried talking</i>
<i>to her about it?</i>

352
00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:14.170
Yes.

353
00:21:14.206 --> 00:21:17.609
<i>No. I mean</i> actually<i> talking</i>
<i>to her about it.</i>

354
00:21:17.644 --> 00:21:20.076
<i>Like setting ground rules.</i>

355
00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:23.119
<i>making your standards</i>
<i>explicitly clear.</i>

356
00:21:23.154 --> 00:21:25.224
I guess you're right.

357
00:21:25.259 --> 00:21:27.727
I just. like-- my anxiety's
running my life.

358
00:21:27.762 --> 00:21:31.122
<i>And it can be...</i>

359
00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:35.491
<i>Overwhelming when...</i>

360
00:21:35.526 --> 00:21:39.669
<i>you let your anxiety consume</i>
<i>the people around you as well.</i>

361
00:21:40.634 --> 00:21:42.165
Wait. is that how you felt?

362
00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.640
Is that why you. like. you
left earlier than...

363
00:21:45.676 --> 00:21:49.076
<i>No. no. no. no.</i>
<i>My mom made me come home.</i>

364
00:21:49.111 --> 00:21:50.243
<i>Um...</i>

365
00:21:50.278 --> 00:21:52.482
<i>But yeah.</i>

366
00:21:52.518 --> 00:21:54.552
<i>Like. I did feel that way</i>
<i>a little bit.</i>

367
00:21:56.048 --> 00:21:57.851
<i>I-- I didn't mind it</i>
<i>too much though</i>

368
00:21:57.886 --> 00:22:00.454
<i>because I know how important</i>
<i>this is for you.</i>

369
00:22:00.489 --> 00:22:02.956
<i>Amanda knows you have CF.</i>

370
00:22:02.992 --> 00:22:06.531
<i>But I don't think she</i>
<i>understands what that means.</i>

371
00:22:07.697 --> 00:22:10.331
<i> But she's just</i>
<i>a sub-leaser.</i>

372
00:22:11.632 --> 00:22:13.102
A sub-leaser who's gonna be here

373
00:22:13.137 --> 00:22:14.834
for the next year.

374
00:22:14.869 --> 00:22:17.608
Just tell her.
It'll make your life easier.

375
00:22:34.389 --> 00:22:36.089
-Hey.
-Hey!

376
00:22:36.925 --> 00:22:39.523
So I just-- uh. I just wanted
to talk to you.

377
00:22:40.026 --> 00:22:43.797
Um. I guess you should know
about me.

378
00:22:43.832 --> 00:22:46.529
Well. since we're gonna be
living together.

379
00:22:46.565 --> 00:22:49.066
I just...

380
00:22:49.101 --> 00:22:53.369
Um. I thought
you should know that. um...

381
00:22:55.048 --> 00:22:58.044
I have Cystic Fibrosis.

382
00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.021
Oh.

383
00:23:02.056 --> 00:23:03.321
Yeah. no. yeah.
It's not--

384
00:23:03.356 --> 00:23:06.558
It's not a big deal or anything.
Um...

385
00:23:06.593 --> 00:23:09.327
It's just. like. you might see
some. like. equipment.

386
00:23:09.362 --> 00:23:13.059
uh. laying around
or. like. just...

387
00:23:15.131 --> 00:23:16.469
Okay.

388
00:23:18.764 --> 00:23:20.500
Yeah!
Uh. yeah.

389
00:23:20.535 --> 00:23:22.440
Cool.
Well...

390
00:23:22.475 --> 00:23:27.342
Now that you know.
that is a cool fun fact

391
00:23:27.377 --> 00:23:28.443
that you know about me.

392
00:23:28.479 --> 00:23:30.106
Okay.
I'll talk to you later.

393
00:23:30.141 --> 00:23:32.510
That's a really good juice.
that.

394
00:23:32.546 --> 00:23:34.280
See ya later.

395
00:23:36.656 --> 00:23:40.015
It's just like it's so much
easier being alone.

396
00:23:40.051 --> 00:23:41.527
<i> You sure?</i>

397
00:23:42.757 --> 00:23:45.630
<i>But you're not alone anymore.</i>

398
00:23:53.766 --> 00:23:55.798
-Hey.
-Mm.

399
00:23:55.834 --> 00:23:57.202
What's up?

400
00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:01.107
This.

401
00:24:01.942 --> 00:24:03.908
Looks like we have
the same idea.

402
00:24:03.944 --> 00:24:05.947
Since when are you
a big drinker?

403
00:24:07.246 --> 00:24:10.347
Quarantine has a tendency
to change things.

404
00:24:11.592 --> 00:24:14.318
Can you just. um.
wipe that down though please?

405
00:24:15.093 --> 00:24:16.826
Uh. okay.

406
00:24:24.602 --> 00:24:26.065
Yeah. can you just
maybe thorough--

407
00:24:26.101 --> 00:24:29.242
Terese. look-- I'm not
irresponsible or anything.

408
00:24:29.277 --> 00:24:31.338
Can you stop watching me
like a hawk?

409
00:24:31.374 --> 00:24:32.774
Okay. I'm sorry.

410
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:34.742
I don't mean to be. like.
backseat cleaning.

411
00:24:34.777 --> 00:24:36.648
but I just-- I realized
we haven't had

412
00:24:36.683 --> 00:24:39.118
a proper conversation
about COVID safety procedures

413
00:24:39.153 --> 00:24:40.751
since you've been back. and I--

414
00:24:40.786 --> 00:24:44.280
I really just do need
a little bit more from you.

415
00:24:44.315 --> 00:24:46.492
What. do you want me
to get tested more?

416
00:24:46.528 --> 00:24:48.360
Sure. I mean. getting tested
more would be great.

417
00:24:48.395 --> 00:24:50.428
but by the time
you tested positive.

418
00:24:50.463 --> 00:24:51.660
you would have
already exposed me.

419
00:24:51.695 --> 00:24:52.958
And I'm just trying
to think of ways

420
00:24:52.994 --> 00:24:55.194
we can both avoid exposure
in general.

421
00:24:56.163 --> 00:24:58.366
For me. best practice is
to kind of overreact.

422
00:24:58.401 --> 00:25:01.870
and with CF. it--

423
00:25:01.905 --> 00:25:04.638
like. I just-- I have to be
at a higher alert

424
00:25:04.673 --> 00:25:07.344
for this kind of stuff. so...

425
00:25:07.379 --> 00:25:10.808
It just makes me really anxious.

426
00:25:10.843 --> 00:25:13.116
Yeah.
I can tell.

427
00:25:19.419 --> 00:25:22.021
I realize I should have said
this right when you got back.

428
00:25:22.057 --> 00:25:24.658
but I just need you to be
at the same level

429
00:25:24.693 --> 00:25:26.399
of precaution as me or it--

430
00:25:26.434 --> 00:25:29.261
it's just kind of all
for nothing then.

431
00:25:31.668 --> 00:25:34.396
Okay.
So what are the rules?

432
00:25:34.432 --> 00:25:36.372
Okay. well everything that comes
into the house

433
00:25:36.407 --> 00:25:37.638
has to be wiped down.

434
00:25:37.673 --> 00:25:39.402
I mean. sanitized completely.

435
00:25:39.438 --> 00:25:42.137
Sanitize your hands.
Wash your hands right after.

436
00:25:42.172 --> 00:25:44.142
Leave all the bags in the trash.

437
00:25:44.177 --> 00:25:45.876
Make sure that you always have
gloves on

438
00:25:45.911 --> 00:25:47.553
whenever you're outside.

439
00:25:47.588 --> 00:25:49.312
Sanitize the gloves
when you have the chance.

440
00:25:49.347 --> 00:25:50.417
Keep your mask on.

441
00:25:50.452 --> 00:25:51.686
I know it...

442
00:25:57.794 --> 00:26:00.091
<i>That was definitely expired.</i>

443
00:26:00.127 --> 00:26:01.757
<i>Maybe I shouldn't have</i>
<i>finished it.</i>

444
00:26:05.371 --> 00:26:06.401
<i>Oh. my God.</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

445
00:26:06.437 --> 00:26:07.906
<i>Wait.</i>
<i>Um...</i>

446
00:26:07.941 --> 00:26:09.738
<i>Okay.</i>

447
00:26:09.773 --> 00:26:12.537
<i>Amanda said...</i>
<i>to shoot my shot.</i>

448
00:26:12.572 --> 00:26:13.907
<i>Right?</i>

449
00:26:13.942 --> 00:26:15.410
<i>I mean. I guess</i>
<i>it couldn't hurt.</i>

450
00:26:15.446 --> 00:26:17.815
<i>What do I say...?</i>

451
00:26:20.316 --> 00:26:21.819
Hey!

452
00:26:22.923 --> 00:26:24.451
Hey.

453
00:26:24.487 --> 00:26:25.850
Uh. how are you?

454
00:26:27.092 --> 00:26:28.557
Lonely.

455
00:26:28.592 --> 00:26:30.958
All alone in this apartment.

456
00:26:30.994 --> 00:26:33.632
Respecting quarantine
to the highest level.

457
00:26:33.667 --> 00:26:36.031
I could really use someone
to keep me company.

458
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:39.364
Do you know anyone
who's available?

459
00:26:40.338 --> 00:26:42.268
Anyone at all?

460
00:26:45.508 --> 00:26:47.143
What?

461
00:26:47.845 --> 00:26:49.646
I said. "Did you hear
about the protests?"

462
00:26:49.681 --> 00:26:51.416
They're happening down
the street.

463
00:26:51.452 --> 00:26:53.077
Oh. that is what--
yeah. that's--

464
00:26:53.113 --> 00:26:54.546
that is definitely
what you said.

465
00:26:54.581 --> 00:26:56.584
Um. yes!

466
00:26:56.619 --> 00:26:57.914
Are you going to that?

467
00:26:57.949 --> 00:26:59.483
Yeah!
Are you?

468
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:02.756
No.
No. 'cause I--

469
00:27:02.791 --> 00:27:05.187
just 'cause I'm. like. so busy.

470
00:27:05.223 --> 00:27:08.330
and like. my schedule is<i> packed!</i>

471
00:27:08.365 --> 00:27:09.894
Ridiculous.

472
00:27:09.929 --> 00:27:11.737
This girl's got emails.

473
00:27:13.035 --> 00:27:14.737
Yeah. no. that sounds
really cool though.

474
00:27:14.772 --> 00:27:17.039
Uh. and I hope you have
a lot of fun.

475
00:27:19.547 --> 00:27:22.506
You're plants look
really good...right now.

476
00:27:24.043 --> 00:27:26.642
And your hair.
You left.

477
00:27:30.454 --> 00:27:32.489
<i>Fun?</i>
<i>Fun.</i>

478
00:27:32.524 --> 00:27:34.193
<i>Why did I say fun?</i>

479
00:27:34.228 --> 00:27:36.187
<i>Protests aren't fun.</i>

480
00:27:36.222 --> 00:27:38.760
<i>They are important</i>
<i>and necessary.</i>

481
00:27:38.795 --> 00:27:40.861
<i>-but they aren't fun.</i>

482
00:27:40.897 --> 00:27:42.492
<i>Although I guess</i>
<i>I wouldn't know</i>

483
00:27:42.527 --> 00:27:44.328
<i>because my fear</i>
<i>of catching COVID and dying</i>

484
00:27:44.363 --> 00:27:47.201
<i>has kept me from attending.</i>
<i>but God--</i>

485
00:27:47.236 --> 00:27:50.169
<i>now he probably thinks</i>
<i>I am this terrible person</i>

486
00:27:50.204 --> 00:27:52.841
<i>with my packed</i>
<i>fucking schedule. like.</i>

487

503
00:28:36.122 --> 00:28:37.680
Mm-hmm.

504
00:28:37.715 --> 00:28:40.221
Were you gonna wipe those down
like we talked about?

505
00:28:41.393 --> 00:28:43.724
Yeah. I just--

506
00:28:43.759 --> 00:28:45.721
I got in. and I just--

507
00:28:46.861 --> 00:28:49.297
I forgot.
I'm sorry.

508
00:28:49.799 --> 00:28:52.162
It's just so much to remember.

509
00:28:52.197 --> 00:28:54.999
It's a lot sometimes. I know.

510
00:28:55.034 --> 00:28:57.000
Then why do you do it?

511
00:28:57.035 --> 00:28:58.736
Because I have to.

512
00:28:59.639 --> 00:29:02.847
But you said it yourself;
you're kind of overreacting.

513
00:29:02.882 --> 00:29:05.408
I mean. wiping my fruit down
just doesn't seem

514
00:29:05.444 --> 00:29:07.245
like it should be
that big of a deal.

515
00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:10.345
Well. it is.
The small things matter.

516
00:29:21.596 --> 00:29:25.602
It's just like she makes me feel
like I'm being the selfish one.

517
00:29:25.637 --> 00:29:29.270
It's not fun for me. you know?

518
00:29:31.977 --> 00:29:34.138
<i>Do you think she got it?</i>

519
00:29:34.173 --> 00:29:36.112
<i>Like. when you explained CF</i>

520
00:29:36.148 --> 00:29:39.610
<i>and the COVID dangers</i>
<i>and all that a little bit more?</i>

521
00:29:40.751 --> 00:29:42.448
Maybe I should just go home.

522
00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:45.616
<i>Really?</i>

523
00:29:46.318 --> 00:29:49.287
Why. is it a bad idea?

524
00:29:49.323 --> 00:29:52.524
<i>You were just always</i>
<i>so against it.</i>

525
00:29:57.035 --> 00:29:58.967
Yeah. but if there's anyone
who won't flack me

526
00:29:59.002 --> 00:30:01.038
for my control issues.
it's my mom.

527
00:30:01.969 --> 00:30:03.469
Learned from the best.

528
00:30:10.878 --> 00:30:12.676
What the fuck?

529
00:30:16.521 --> 00:30:17.621
I saw your story.

530
00:30:17.656 --> 00:30:19.481
Did you go to a restuarant?

531
00:30:19.517 --> 00:30:21.118
Oh. yeah.
Didn't it look so good?

532
00:30:21.153 --> 00:30:23.088
Why would you do that?

533
00:30:23.123 --> 00:30:24.925
Well. I went to go get take-out

534
00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.657
but decided I wanted it hot.

535
00:30:27.492 --> 00:30:30.232
It doesn't matter.
It's not safe.

536
00:30:31.565 --> 00:30:34.498
Well. if it weren't safe.
why would they be open?

537
00:30:34.534 --> 00:30:37.140
Because the American government
is incompetent?

538
00:30:37.175 --> 00:30:39.444
Because the economy has been
deemed more important

539
00:30:39.479 --> 00:30:41.078
than people's health?

540
00:30:43.378 --> 00:30:45.280
Well. you don't even care
about your health.

541
00:30:50.152 --> 00:30:51.952
What are you
talking about?

542
00:30:51.987 --> 00:30:53.783
You smoke every single day.

543
00:30:54.593 --> 00:30:56.692
Okay.
And?

544
00:30:56.728 --> 00:30:58.026
I slack on my treatments.

545
00:30:58.062 --> 00:30:59.556
and I might not take
my meds every day.

546
00:30:59.591 --> 00:31:01.360
but that's kind of none
of your business.

547
00:31:01.396 --> 00:31:03.669
Well. I just think
it's a little hypocritical

548
00:31:03.704 --> 00:31:05.133
that you yell at me
for going out

549
00:31:05.168 --> 00:31:06.904
when you don't even take care
of yourself.

550
00:31:06.939 --> 00:31:09.464
My slacking on a long-term
treatment plan

551
00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.136
is nowhere near
the same thing

552
00:31:11.171 --> 00:31:13.742
as not wanting to die of COVID.

553
00:31:13.778 --> 00:31:15.538
But I remember you saying

554
00:31:15.573 --> 00:31:17.573
you thought you
could survive COVID.

555
00:31:17.608 --> 00:31:20.150
Yeah.
I was probably being hopeful.

556
00:31:21.118 --> 00:31:23.313
And it's not just
about surviving it.

557
00:31:23.348 --> 00:31:24.755
You know. I could probably live

558
00:31:24.791 --> 00:31:27.124
but my lungs
would never recover.

559
00:31:30.025 --> 00:31:32.255
I-- I didn't think that--

560
00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:34.394
Yeah.
You didn't.

561
00:31:34.429 --> 00:31:37.562
Amanda. you should probably
go back to Zack's

562
00:31:37.598 --> 00:31:40.170
and just make both
of our lives easier if you can--

563
00:31:48.714 --> 00:31:49.845
Okay. I'm sorry.
I didn't--

564
00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.776
I don't mean to kick you out.

565
00:31:51.811 --> 00:31:54.517
It's just. like. if you can't
take this seriously. then...

566
00:31:54.552 --> 00:31:55.784
No.

567
00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:57.886
I can't go back to Zack's.

568
00:31:57.921 --> 00:32:01.257
The break is kind of indefinite.

569
00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:07.863
We got in a big fight and...

570
00:32:07.898 --> 00:32:09.263
I thought it was just a break.

571
00:32:09.298 --> 00:32:13.029
but he hasn't called or texted
or anything.

572
00:32:13.464 --> 00:32:15.502
So maybe you should call him.

573
00:32:18.304 --> 00:32:20.378
No.
I'm not ready for that.

574
00:32:20.414 --> 00:32:22.514
Um. 'cause...

575
00:32:22.983 --> 00:32:25.985
what if he answers
and confirms that it's over?

576
00:32:26.617 --> 00:32:28.116
Yeah. yeah.

577
00:32:28.151 --> 00:32:31.048
Take your time.
do what you need to do

578
00:32:31.084 --> 00:32:33.150
to get over him.

579
00:32:33.185 --> 00:32:34.458
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

580
00:32:34.493 --> 00:32:37.563
And. Amanda.

581
00:32:37.598 --> 00:32:40.628
stick to take-out-- please.

582
00:32:40.663 --> 00:32:42.133
Okay.

583
00:32:51.137 --> 00:32:52.509
<i> Hello?</i>

584
00:32:52.545 --> 00:32:54.480
Hey. it's me.

585
00:32:54.515 --> 00:32:56.405
<i>Hi. honey!</i>
<i>Ah!</i>

586
00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:58.380
<i>What a nice surprise.</i>

587
00:32:59.784 --> 00:33:02.016
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

588
00:33:02.052 --> 00:33:05.651
Yes. I'm fine.
I was just...

589
00:33:06.794 --> 00:33:09.259
calling. um.
'cause I was wondering

590
00:33:09.294 --> 00:33:13.289
what it would. like. be like
if I were to come home.

591
00:33:13.324 --> 00:33:14.999
<i>Ah!</i>
<i>Really?</i>

592
00:33:15.034 --> 00:33:17.460
<i>Well. I would love to have you.</i>
<i>of course.</i>

593
00:33:17.495 --> 00:33:19.296
<i>But why?</i>
<i>What's going on?</i>

594
00:33:19.331 --> 00:33:21.998
Um...nothing. I'm fine.

595
00:33:22.033 --> 00:33:26.276
I was just thinking it'd be nice
to have a change of pace.

596
00:33:27.574 --> 00:33:30.043
<i>Okay. sure.</i>
<i>Well. that's exciting.</i>

597
00:33:30.078 --> 00:33:31.707
<i>I could use the company.</i>

598
00:33:31.743 --> 00:33:34.019
<i>Makes me wish</i>
<i>I'd had another kid.</i>

599
00:33:34.055 --> 00:33:36.885
<i>Now. hun. you'll have</i>
<i>to pay for an extra bag</i>

600
00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:39.188
<i>to bring your vest in.</i>

601
00:33:39.223 --> 00:33:41.126
<i>Are you stocked up</i>
<i>on all your meds?</i>

602
00:33:41.161 --> 00:33:43.621
<i>We could just re-order things</i>
<i>once you get here.</i>

603
00:33:43.656 --> 00:33:45.964
<i>So you don't have</i>
<i>to lug 'em all over.</i>

604
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.664
<i>Are you still on Trikafta?</i>
<i>Because that's--</i>

605
00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:51.197
Yeah. I was just

606
00:33:51.232 --> 00:33:53.170
thinking. like. hypothetically.

607
00:33:53.205 --> 00:33:57.474
Um. I don't think
I would wanna leave LA yet.

608
00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:59.069
Sorry.

609
00:33:59.104 --> 00:34:00.739
<i>Aww.</i>

610
00:34:00.774 --> 00:34:02.679
<i>You know you're always</i>
<i>welcome here. sweetheart.</i>

611
00:34:02.714 --> 00:34:04.314
Yeah. I know. Mom.

612
00:34:21.398 --> 00:34:23.199
<i>Sure he looks like</i>
<i>the perfect man.</i>

613
00:34:23.234 --> 00:34:27.001
<i>but he could be. like.</i>
<i>a serial killer</i>

614
00:34:27.036 --> 00:34:30.668
<i>or worse-- a scorpio.</i>

615
00:34:30.704 --> 00:34:33.640
<i> Only one way</i>
<i>to find out though.</i>

616
00:34:36.207 --> 00:34:39.976
<i>I'd love it if my bangs could</i>
<i>just not look like barcodes.</i>

617
00:34:40.717 --> 00:34:42.154
<i>Gross.</i>

618
00:34:50.628 --> 00:34:51.893
Hey!

619
00:34:51.928 --> 00:34:53.429
-Hey.
-Hey.

620
00:34:53.464 --> 00:34:55.093
-Oh. whoa. sorry. six feet.
-Oh. right. six feet.

621
00:34:56.129 --> 00:34:57.536
How are you?

622
00:34:57.571 --> 00:34:59.470
I'm good. ya know?

623
00:34:59.506 --> 00:35:01.600
I just...

624
00:35:01.635 --> 00:35:04.236
Making like a plant
and photosynthesizing.

625
00:35:04.271 --> 00:35:05.709
Aren't we all?

626
00:35:05.744 --> 00:35:07.077
We're all plants.

627
00:35:07.112 --> 00:35:09.538
So glad to see
that you're a plant guy

628
00:35:09.573 --> 00:35:11.242
'cause I'm a plant girl.

629
00:35:11.277 --> 00:35:12.541
-Really?
-Yes!

630
00:35:12.577 --> 00:35:13.814
Wow. what's your favorite?

631
00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:16.616
Oh. um...

632
00:35:16.651 --> 00:35:18.614
Just so many. I can't even
remember the names.

633
00:35:18.649 --> 00:35:20.124
-It's. like. crazy.
-I know.

634
00:35:20.159 --> 00:35:21.894
The names are hard.
I just like the shapes.

635
00:35:21.929 --> 00:35:23.553
-The shapes are cool.
-Yeah. yeah.

636
00:35:23.588 --> 00:35:25.894
-I love your plants.
-Thanks!

637
00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:27.129
They're super sick.

638
00:35:27.165 --> 00:35:28.758
How long have you
been doing this?

639
00:35:28.793 --> 00:35:30.662
Oh. just from the start
of quarantine.

640
00:35:30.697 --> 00:35:32.462
No way. I would've thought
this was. like.

641
00:35:32.497 --> 00:35:33.761
a many years endeavor.

642
00:35:33.797 --> 00:35:35.635
-No. no. just started.
-Wow.

643
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:36.931
I think they're
looking pretty good.

644
00:35:36.967 --> 00:35:38.769
I gotta cut a couple
in the back but...

645
00:35:38.804 --> 00:35:40.570
<i> I wish it</i>
<i>weren't a pandemic</i>

646
00:35:40.605 --> 00:35:43.279
<i>so I could just ask him out.</i>

647
00:35:43.315 --> 00:35:45.245
<i>I guess that's not stopping</i>
<i>some people.</i>

648
00:35:45.281 --> 00:35:48.319
<i>but I'm not just some people.</i>

649
00:35:56.223 --> 00:35:58.128
<i>Yes.</i>

650
00:35:58.164 --> 00:36:01.326
<i>Yo. why would anyone</i>
<i>ever use a bowl?</i>

651
00:36:01.361 --> 00:36:02.924
<i>This is so efficient.</i>

652
00:36:02.959 --> 00:36:05.567
<i>and it doesn't dirty</i>
<i>any dishes.</i>

653
00:36:06.871 --> 00:36:08.807
<i>Bowl. bowl.</i>

654
00:36:08.842 --> 00:36:10.869
<i>Should I smoke another bowl?</i>

655
00:36:19.013 --> 00:36:20.049
Mm.

656
00:36:20.085 --> 00:36:21.611
<i>Spoons are like small shovels.</i>

657
00:36:21.646 --> 00:36:23.288
<i>I never thought about that.</i>

658
00:36:33.362 --> 00:36:35.662
<i>Where are you going?</i>

659
00:36:35.697 --> 00:36:38.567
<i>What would you have</i>
<i>to look that nice for?</i>

660
00:36:45.708 --> 00:36:47.939
<i>What if she's going</i>
<i>to see someone?</i>

661
00:36:55.854 --> 00:36:57.420
<i>No.</i>

662
00:36:57.456 --> 00:36:59.858
<i>I'm way too high to talk</i>
<i>about this right now.</i>

663
00:36:59.893 --> 00:37:01.752
<i>I don't want any smoke tonight.</i>

664
00:37:01.788 --> 00:37:04.153
<i>-Except the weed kind.</i>

665
00:37:24.146 --> 00:37:25.179
<i>Hmm.</i>

666
00:37:25.214 --> 00:37:26.851
<i>She's been gone a while.</i>

667
00:37:28.487 --> 00:37:31.217
Yeah. she's. like.
really strict. so...

668
00:37:38.491 --> 00:37:39.925
Who the fuck is that?

669
00:37:44.297 --> 00:37:45.934
I'm Sean.

670
00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:47.697
Hi.
Shut up.

671
00:37:47.733 --> 00:37:49.303
And get the fuck
out of my house.

672
00:37:49.339 --> 00:37:51.275
-Terese.
-No. keep the mask on!

673
00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:53.535
Why are you still here?
Get out of my house!

674
00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:55.814
Now. please.

675
00:37:55.849 --> 00:37:58.649
What the-- who was that?

676
00:37:58.685 --> 00:38:01.544
Um...Sean.

677
00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:03.779
Sean.
Sean who?

678
00:38:03.814 --> 00:38:06.017
I don't know.
I met him...

679
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:09.121
online.

680
00:38:10.425 --> 00:38:12.798
You did not go on a Tinder date

681
00:38:12.833 --> 00:38:14.663
in a fucking pandemic.

682
00:38:14.698 --> 00:38:16.558
You told me to do what I had
to do to get over Zack.

683
00:38:16.593 --> 00:38:17.995
Oh. my God.

684
00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:19.764
I meant. like. drink
a bottle of vodka and cry.

685
00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.339
like egg his house.
harass him online.

686
00:38:21.374 --> 00:38:24.904
not bring some<i> fucker</i> named Sean
into my house!

687
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:27.407
Our house.

688
00:38:27.443 --> 00:38:29.440
You're right.
I am so sorry.

689
00:38:29.475 --> 00:38:30.839
We both live here.

690
00:38:30.874 --> 00:38:32.680
You just put us both at risk!

691
00:38:32.716 --> 00:38:35.615
For what. stilted conversation
and a quick fuck?

692
00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:38.922
Amanda. in what world
was this okay?

693
00:38:39.558 --> 00:38:41.589
We've only talked about. like.
wiping things down

694
00:38:41.624 --> 00:38:43.286
-and sticking to takeout...
-Oh. my God.

695
00:38:43.321 --> 00:38:46.822
I thought the "not mingling
with strangers" was implicit.

696
00:38:46.857 --> 00:38:48.593
He tested negative last week.

697
00:38:48.628 --> 00:38:51.369
He tested negative last week?

698
00:38:51.405 --> 00:38:53.766
Anything could've happened
within that last week.

699
00:38:53.801 --> 00:38:56.170
especially if he's going out
on random dates

700
00:38:56.205 --> 00:38:57.770
during a pandemic!

701
00:38:57.806 --> 00:38:59.845
Well. we weren't. like.
coughing on each other.

702
00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:01.473
Are you a fucking idiot?

703
00:39:01.509 --> 00:39:02.607
Are you a fucking idiot?!

704
00:39:02.643 --> 00:39:04.174
I know you're
from Arizona.

705
00:39:04.209 --> 00:39:06.275
but I thought you understood.
like. simple science.

706
00:39:09.083 --> 00:39:12.217
You're acting like I want
to give you COVID or something.

707
00:39:12.919 --> 00:39:16.625
You're not trying very hard
to prevent it.

708
00:39:16.661 --> 00:39:19.330
You can go out and be reckless
and irresponsible

709
00:39:19.365 --> 00:39:21.199
and probably get away with it
scot-free.

710
00:39:21.234 --> 00:39:22.899
but if you bring COVID
into this house.

711
00:39:22.934 --> 00:39:24.535
I could die.

712
00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:35.612
A ventilator may have always
been part of my future.

713
00:39:36.943 --> 00:39:39.515
but if you're going
to live here with me.

714
00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:40.852
I need you to make sure
it doesn't become

715
00:39:40.888 --> 00:39:42.916
part of my present.

716
00:39:44.548 --> 00:39:45.787
Okay.

717
00:39:46.751 --> 00:39:49.120
CF is a lung disease.

718
00:39:50.087 --> 00:39:54.492
If I get COVID.
I could be done for.

719
00:39:54.528 --> 00:39:56.666
This is so serious.

720
00:39:57.595 --> 00:39:59.062
I'm sorry.

721
00:39:59.098 --> 00:40:02.037
This must be so hard for you.
I can't imagine.

722
00:40:03.909 --> 00:40:05.301
Well try to.

723
00:40:07.204 --> 00:40:09.409
And we need to both quarantine
in our rooms

724
00:40:09.445 --> 00:40:11.912
until you can get tested.

725
00:40:26.399 --> 00:40:28.929
<i> As if I weren't</i>
<i>confined enough.</i>

726
00:41:33.791 --> 00:41:35.160
Hey.

727
00:41:36.133 --> 00:41:37.499
Don't worry.

728
00:41:37.535 --> 00:41:39.335
Um. I just wanted
to let you know

729
00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:41.963
that my test came back negative.

730
00:41:41.998 --> 00:41:44.138
That's lucky.

731
00:41:44.173 --> 00:41:45.472
Yeah.

732
00:41:45.507 --> 00:41:47.606
And for what it's worth.

733
00:41:47.642 --> 00:41:50.373
Sean also tested negative.

734
00:41:50.408 --> 00:41:53.183
He sent me a screenshot
when he asked me out again.

735
00:41:53.219 --> 00:41:55.851
Well. have fun with that.

736
00:41:57.522 --> 00:41:59.789
I'm not gonna go out
with him again.

737
00:42:00.724 --> 00:42:04.255
You were right.
It was a stupid thing to do.

738
00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:08.094
I was just so upset over Zack.

739
00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:11.697
But I finally called him.

740
00:42:11.732 --> 00:42:14.567
and we had a really good talk.

741
00:42:14.602 --> 00:42:16.568
Uh. we're back together.

742
00:42:16.603 --> 00:42:19.500
Or still together.

743
00:42:19.536 --> 00:42:22.739
But I think I'm gonna start
staying there again.

744
00:42:22.775 --> 00:42:24.372
Oh. that is so good!

745
00:42:24.407 --> 00:42:26.712
I-- that-- that's so good
for you guys.

746
00:42:26.747 --> 00:42:30.054
Like. I'm so happy for you guys.

747
00:42:30.089 --> 00:42:31.420
-Wow.
-Yeah.

748
00:42:31.455 --> 00:42:34.057
Um. I think it's for the best.

749
00:42:34.093 --> 00:42:35.756
Yeah.

750
00:42:35.791 --> 00:42:39.093
I'm sorry I made you feel
so unsafe.

751
00:42:39.762 --> 00:42:41.600
I don't wanna
stress you out anymore.

752
00:42:42.861 --> 00:42:44.766
Plus I miss him so much.

753
00:42:44.801 --> 00:42:47.531
It is so hard being lonely
in these times.

754
00:42:49.934 --> 00:42:52.006
Don't I know it.

755
00:42:52.774 --> 00:42:54.837
Okay.
Uh. I'm gonna go pack.

756
00:42:54.873 --> 00:42:56.945
Yes. yeah.
Go pack.

757
00:42:58.481 --> 00:43:00.443
Go-- go pack. girl.

758
00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:11.190
-I'm gonna head out.
-Okay. cool.

759
00:43:14.166 --> 00:43:16.360

<i>What's up?</i>
<i>How are you?</i>

796
00:45:02.504 --> 00:45:04.039
Terrible.

797
00:45:05.169 --> 00:45:06.971
There's nothing to watch.

798
00:45:07.006 --> 00:45:09.207
<i>Oh. so it's. like. really</i>

799
00:45:09.242 --> 00:45:11.376
<i>the end of the world then.</i>
<i>isn't it?</i>

800
00:45:13.111 --> 00:45:15.083
Yeah. no. what do I watch?

801
00:45:15.118 --> 00:45:19.323
<i>Maybe you shouldn't keep</i>
<i>binging into eternity. hm?</i>

802
00:45:19.359 --> 00:45:22.052
What else is there to do?

803
00:45:22.088 --> 00:45:25.390
<i>Uh. you could pick up a hobby.</i>

804
00:45:28.229 --> 00:45:31.431
Like crocheting or knitting.
like some retiree?

805
00:45:31.466 --> 00:45:32.698
<i>Maybe?</i>

806
00:45:32.733 --> 00:45:34.566
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.

807
00:45:34.601 --> 00:45:35.837
Nope.

808
00:45:35.872 --> 00:45:37.538
Binge-watching things
is my hobby.

809
00:45:37.573 --> 00:45:39.104
<i>No. it's not.</i>

810
00:45:39.139 --> 00:45:41.443
<i>It's an avoidance</i>
<i>of productivity.</i>

811
00:45:41.479 --> 00:45:43.714
How profound of you.

812
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:46.584
I didn't know our therapy
session was today.

813
00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:48.580
-It's not even Tuesday!
<i>-It is Tuesday.</i>

814
00:45:48.615 --> 00:45:49.881
<i>So...</i>

815
00:45:49.916 --> 00:45:51.412
Okay.
You're right.

816
00:45:51.448 --> 00:45:53.456
This is why you
are my therapist.

817
00:46:00.795 --> 00:46:03.023
Why aren't you rising?

818
00:46:32.931 --> 00:46:34.564
<i> Maybe I should have</i>
<i>asked Sydney</i>

819
00:46:34.599 --> 00:46:36.965
<i>before I painted her table.</i>

820
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.095
<i>Whatever.</i>
<i>It looks sick as fuck now.</i>

821
00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:40.634
<i>She's gonna love it.</i>

822
00:47:07.062 --> 00:47:09.494
<i>I have been coughing</i>
<i>more lately.</i>

823
00:47:13.496 --> 00:47:15.135
<i>Makes it kind of hard to deny</i>

824
00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:17.537
<i>that I really need</i>
<i>to do my treatments.</i>

825
00:47:18.577 --> 00:47:20.434
<i>It only takes 30 minutes.</i>

826
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:23.337
<i>I mean. just. you know. do it.</i>

827
00:47:23.372 --> 00:47:25.514
<i>Just pick it up and...</i>

828
00:47:26.552 --> 00:47:28.953
Bagel Bites.
Bagel Bites.

829
00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:33.291
<i>Oh. my God.</i>

830
00:47:33.326 --> 00:47:35.784
<i>That is amazing.</i>

831
00:47:37.191 --> 00:47:40.061
I know he lost.
but he's just so cute.

832
00:47:40.096 --> 00:47:42.063
<i>And you said</i>
<i>you couldn't find a hobby.</i>

833
00:47:42.099 --> 00:47:44.200
Yeah. well this one is getting
dangerous though

834
00:47:44.235 --> 00:47:48.740
because I'm painting. like.
anything I can get my hands on:

835
00:47:48.775 --> 00:47:51.805
mugs. almost did the wall
the other day...

836
00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:53.169
Oh. my God. furniture.

837
00:47:53.204 --> 00:47:54.946
<i>Uh. your furniture?</i>

838
00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:58.313
Okay. so I have a gift for you.

839
00:47:58.348 --> 00:48:00.015
<i>Yeah. Terese if that shit</i>
<i>doesn't look like it came</i>

840
00:48:00.051 --> 00:48:02.082
<i>straight out of a Pier 1</i>
<i>Imports catalogue.</i>

841
00:48:02.117 --> 00:48:04.353
<i>your ass is off the lease.</i>
<i>so...</i>

842
00:48:05.622 --> 00:48:07.418
I'm off the lease.

843
00:48:15.801 --> 00:48:18.331
<i>Whoa. are you--</i>
<i>are you all right?</i>

844
00:48:18.366 --> 00:48:20.666
Yeah. no. I'm good.
I just cough when I laugh.

845
00:48:22.203 --> 00:48:26.273
<i>Well. that's not normal.</i>
<i>is it?</i>

846
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:27.940
I don't know. maybe I'm just.
like. coming down

847
00:48:27.976 --> 00:48:30.242
with a cold or something.

848
00:48:30.278 --> 00:48:33.382
<i>But you don't think</i>
<i>that it's...?</i>

849
00:48:33.417 --> 00:48:34.843
COVID?

850
00:48:37.647 --> 00:48:40.750
Um. I hadn't thought
about that.

851
00:48:48.958 --> 00:48:51.063
<i> Hello.</i>
<i>CF Center. this is Angela.</i>

852
00:48:51.098 --> 00:48:52.937
Hi.
This is Terese Jackson.

00:48:52.972 --> 00:48:55.100
<i> Hey. Terese.</i>
<i>What can I do for you?</i>

854
00:48:55.135 --> 00:48:56.132
<i>Are you feeling all right?</i>

855
00:48:56.168 --> 00:48:58.405
Uh. yeah. I'm fine.

856
00:48:58.441 --> 00:49:02.203
Well. I-- I do have. like.
a bit of an increased cough

857
00:49:02.239 --> 00:49:03.545
as of recently.

858
00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:04.947
<i>Oh. okay.</i>

859
00:49:04.983 --> 00:49:06.748
<i>Have you had any fever</i>
<i>or headaches</i>

860
00:49:06.783 --> 00:49:08.215
<i>associated with it?</i>

861
00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:12.083
Um. maybe a few headaches.
but no fever.

862
00:49:12.118 --> 00:49:14.455
<i> That I know of.</i>

863
00:49:14.490 --> 00:49:17.252
<i> Have you lost your</i>
<i>sense of taste or smell at all?</i>

864
00:49:17.287 --> 00:49:18.789
<i>Any diarrhea?</i>

865
00:49:18.825 --> 00:49:20.293
No.

866
00:49:20.329 --> 00:49:22.297
<i> Okay. then</i>
<i>it's likely not COVID.</i>

867
00:49:22.333 --> 00:49:24.794
<i>but you should probably</i>
<i>get tested just to be safe.</i>

868
00:49:24.829 --> 00:49:26.804
<i>And definitely let us know</i>
<i>if you start having</i>

869
00:49:26.839 --> 00:49:28.096
<i>any fevers</i>
<i>or trouble breathing.</i>

870
00:49:28.131 --> 00:49:29.699
Okay.

871
00:49:29.735 --> 00:49:31.072
<i> Try to increase</i>
<i>your airway clearance...</i>

872
00:49:31.107 --> 00:49:32.804
<i> What if I do</i>
<i>have COVID?</i>

873
00:49:32.839 --> 00:49:34.804
<i> ...and definitely make</i>
<i>sure you're staying hydrated.</i>

874
00:49:49.895 --> 00:49:52.525
<i>I do have a few</i>
<i>of these symptoms.</i>

875
00:49:54.198 --> 00:49:57.168
<i>But I don't have it.</i>
<i>I'm just being anxious.</i>

876
00:49:57.203 --> 00:49:59.831
<i>I've barely been anywhere</i>
<i>except the grocery store.</i>

877
00:50:08.341 --> 00:50:09.942
<i>I mean. it doesn't hurt</i>

878
00:50:09.977 --> 00:50:11.507
<i>to get tested.</i>

879
00:50:11.543 --> 00:50:14.052
<i>Better safe than sorry.</i>
<i>I guess.</i>

880
00:50:17.886 --> 00:50:19.684
<i>God.</i>

881
00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:23.127
<i>I did not expect them</i>
<i>to touch my brain like that.</i>

882
00:50:30.263 --> 00:50:33.396
<i>Oh. I'm fucking exhausted.</i>

883
00:50:33.431 --> 00:50:35.039
<i>I guess that's what happens</i>

884
00:50:35.074 --> 00:50:37.570
<i>when you stay up</i>
<i>till- 00 a.m. every night.</i>

885
00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:42.911
<i> Maybe if I just...</i>

886
00:50:42.946 --> 00:50:46.315
<i>close my eyes for a second.</i>

887
00:50:48.711 --> 00:50:50.781
<i>What time is it?</i>

888
00:50:52.523 --> 00:50:53.883
<i>What?</i>

889
00:51:02.931 --> 00:51:04.993
<i>Oh.</i>
<i>God.</i>

890
00:51:05.028 --> 00:51:07.231
<i>I need to start remembering</i>
<i>to wear deodorant</i>

891
00:51:07.266 --> 00:51:09.404
<i>more in quarantine.</i>

892
00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:12.308
<i>Kind of hard when there's no</i>
<i>one around to smell you.</i>

893
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:15.712
<i>Wait.</i>

894
00:51:15.747 --> 00:51:17.514
<i>Why am I so sweaty?</i>

895
00:51:19.615 --> 00:51:23.649
<i>That's...That's what happens</i>
<i>when you break a fever.</i>

896
00:51:27.957 --> 00:51:29.594
<i>Okay.</i>

897
00:51:29.629 --> 00:51:32.289
<i>No fever. no corona.</i>

898
00:51:32.324 --> 00:51:33.857
<i>I'm just being paranoid.</i>

899
00:51:51.814 --> 00:51:53.811
Dear God.

900
00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:59.379
I don't believe in you.

901
00:51:59.415 --> 00:52:01.890
but please

902
00:52:01.926 --> 00:52:04.294
don't let me have corona.

903
00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:08.895
I just-- that would

904
00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:11.394
really suck.

905
00:52:11.429 --> 00:52:13.734
Um...

906
00:52:13.769 --> 00:52:15.239
For me.

907
00:52:15.874 --> 00:52:19.642
And for you. and for everyone.

908
00:52:19.678 --> 00:52:21.872
really. um...

909
00:52:25.817 --> 00:52:28.549
Yeah.
Thank you.

910
00:52:30.482 --> 00:52:33.424
Oh. shit.
I mean. um...

911
00:52:33.459 --> 00:52:34.885
Amen.

912
00:52:36.524 --> 00:52:38.922
And I hope that you're
having a good day.

913
00:52:43.964 --> 00:52:45.236
Ow.

914
00:52:55.241 --> 00:52:56.577
<i>Fuck.</i>

915
00:53:38.253 --> 00:53:40.588
I'm gonna fucking die.

916
00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:06.850
<i> Hello.</i>
<i>CF Center. this is Jenny.</i>

917
00:54:06.885 --> 00:54:08.950
<i> Ugh. not her.</i>

918
00:54:08.985 --> 00:54:10.948
<i>She's the worst.</i>

919
00:54:12.285 --> 00:54:13.549
<i> Hello?</i>

920
00:54:13.584 --> 00:54:16.026
Hi.
This is Terese.

921
00:54:16.062 --> 00:54:19.261
Um. I was just calling
for Angela

922
00:54:19.296 --> 00:54:23.729
or anybody else
that I can talk to.

923
00:54:23.765 --> 00:54:26.101
<i> Oh. everybody's</i>
<i>already out for the day.</i>

924
00:54:26.136 --> 00:54:27.633
<i>I'm the only one in-clinic.</i>

925
00:54:27.669 --> 00:54:30.374
<i>What's going on?</i>
<i>Are you feeling all right?</i>

926
00:54:33.145 --> 00:54:35.471
Yeah. I just--
I think I have COVID.

927
00:54:35.506 --> 00:54:36.872
<i> Oh. no.</i>

928
00:54:36.907 --> 00:54:39.246
<i>Well. um. have you</i>
<i>gotten tested?</i>

929
00:54:39.281 --> 00:54:42.314
Yes.
Yesterday actually.

930
00:54:42.349 --> 00:54:44.111
<i> Good. good.</i>

931
00:54:44.146 --> 00:54:45.818
<i>When are you supposed</i>
<i>to hear back?</i>

932
00:54:46.924 --> 00:54:48.616
Two to five days?

933
00:54:48.651 --> 00:54:49.751
<i> Gotcha.</i>

934
00:54:49.786 --> 00:54:51.093
<i>Well. definitely let us know</i>

935
00:54:51.129 --> 00:54:52.891
<i>when you get that result back.</i>

936
00:54:54.431 --> 00:54:56.532
<i>Have you been having</i>
<i>any symptoms?</i>

937
00:54:57.870 --> 00:54:59.628
Yeah. I had a cough.

938
00:54:59.664 --> 00:55:01.795
Um. it was a normal cough.

939
00:55:01.831 --> 00:55:03.739
Well. it was a sick cough.

940
00:55:03.774 --> 00:55:05.304
And...

941
00:55:05.339 --> 00:55:08.337
Today. I had a fever.

942
00:55:08.372 --> 00:55:10.609
So...

943
00:55:10.645 --> 00:55:13.081
<i> Yeah. you don't</i>
<i>sound good.</i>

944
00:55:13.116 --> 00:55:15.518
<i>You sound really stuffy.</i>

945
00:55:17.187 --> 00:55:20.749
Yeah.
That's 'cause I...

946
00:55:20.784 --> 00:55:23.185
was just crying a little bit.

947
00:55:23.962 --> 00:55:25.522
<i> Oh. honey.</i>

948
00:55:25.557 --> 00:55:27.893
<i>I'm sorry to hear that.</i>

949
00:55:29.366 --> 00:55:32.192
<i>This must be</i>
<i>a lot to deal with.</i>

950
00:55:32.227 --> 00:55:35.867
<i>You know. the anxiety alone.</i>
<i>I'm sure.</i>

951
00:55:35.902 --> 00:55:38.341
<i>We've been exposed to COVID</i>
<i>in the hospital.</i>

952
00:55:38.376 --> 00:55:43.204
<i>and it's just such</i>
<i>a terrible disease.</i>

953
00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:46.679
<i>And of course.</i>
<i>having a chronic lung disease</i>

954
00:55:46.714 --> 00:55:49.987
<i>makes it that much more scary.</i>
<i>right?</i>

955
00:55:50.022 --> 00:55:52.651
<i>This must be really tough.</i>

956
00:55:52.686 --> 00:55:54.485
<i> Thanks for</i>
<i>reminding me.</i>

957
00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:57.018
<i>So helpful. as always.</i>

958
00:55:57.054 --> 00:55:59.793
<i> Terese?</i>
<i>Are you still there?</i>

959
00:56:00.666 --> 00:56:01.762
<i>Hello?</i>

960
00:56:07.468 --> 00:56:08.996
<i> Desperate times call</i>

961
00:56:09.032 --> 00:56:10.969
<i>for desperate measures.</i>
<i>I guess.</i>

962
00:56:14.006 --> 00:56:16.570
<i>Damn. I haven't refilled these</i>
<i>in a minute.</i>

963
00:56:18.709 --> 00:56:20.418
<i>Haven't needed to.</i>

964
00:57:00.483 --> 00:57:02.883
<i>Is there any purpose</i>
<i>in wiping these down</i>

965
00:57:02.918 --> 00:57:04.627
<i>if I already have COVID?</i>

966
00:57:07.094 --> 00:57:10.223
<i>Whatever. I'll just give it</i>
<i>the Amanda treatment.</i>

967
00:57:10.259 --> 00:57:12.767
<i>Watch it be useless</i>
<i>anyway though.</i>

968
00:57:23.247 --> 00:57:24.776
<i>My shopper had to have known</i>

969
00:57:24.812 --> 00:57:27.551
<i>I was not doing well</i>
<i>with this order.</i>

970
00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:48.733
Hey!

971
00:57:48.768 --> 00:57:51.272
<i>Hey.</i>
<i>What are you wearing?</i>

972
00:57:51.307 --> 00:57:52.767
<i>Looks like a life vest.</i>

973
00:57:52.803 --> 00:57:54.742
Oh. this is my vest.

974
00:57:54.778 --> 00:57:57.574
No. this would not help me
very much in the water.

975
00:57:59.252 --> 00:58:01.316
-<i> Your vest?</i>

976
00:58:01.351 --> 00:58:03.213
Yeah. like for my treatments.

977
00:58:04.486 --> 00:58:06.450
Like my airway clearance.

978
00:58:06.485 --> 00:58:08.090
Or whatever.

979
00:58:08.126 --> 00:58:10.484
<i>Oh. right. right.</i>

980
00:58:10.519 --> 00:58:12.728
<i>I feel like I've never</i>
<i>seen you wear that before.</i>

981
00:58:14.224 --> 00:58:17.992
Yeah. probably
'cause I wear it in my room

982
00:58:18.027 --> 00:58:20.032
when I actually do treatments.

983
00:58:23.338 --> 00:58:25.270
<i>Are you okay?</i>

984
00:58:25.305 --> 00:58:26.273
Yeah.

985
00:58:26.309 --> 00:58:27.908
I just. like. um...

986
00:58:30.713 --> 00:58:33.617
I feel like. just. like.
I may have COVID.

987
00:58:34.648 --> 00:58:36.813
<i>Oh. my God.</i>
<i>Um...</i>

988
00:58:36.848 --> 00:58:39.414
<i>Uh. why do you think that?</i>

989
00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:42.687
I don't know. well.
I had that cough.

990
00:58:42.722 --> 00:58:45.994
and then I-- I spiked a fever.

991
00:58:46.030 --> 00:58:49.663
and. um...

992
00:58:49.698 --> 00:58:52.196
I've just been feeling
really shitty.

993
00:58:53.396 --> 00:58:56.801
And. like. I have
some other symptoms. so...

994
00:58:56.837 --> 00:58:59.535
<i>But you haven't</i>
<i>tested positive.</i>

995
00:58:59.570 --> 00:59:01.244
Not yet.

996
00:59:01.279 --> 00:59:03.306
I took a test two days ago.

997
00:59:03.342 --> 00:59:06.148
<i>Uh-huh. and how long till they.</i>
<i>um-- you get that back?</i>

998
00:59:09.186 --> 00:59:10.720
Two to five days.

999
00:59:13.853 --> 00:59:15.315
<i>But you can't know it's COVID</i>

1000
00:59:15.351 --> 00:59:17.727
<i>until you get the results back.</i>
<i>right?</i>

1001
00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:23.530
Yeah. I just-- I don't know what
else it would be though.

1002
00:59:23.565 --> 00:59:25.696
-You know?
-<i> Right.</i>

1003
00:59:25.731 --> 00:59:28.871
<i>Well. um. I'm so sorry</i>

1004
00:59:28.906 --> 00:59:32.339
<i>that you're feeling so shitty</i>
<i>and that you're alone.</i>

1005
00:59:32.374 --> 00:59:34.678
<i>That's so scary.</i>

1006
00:59:36.077 --> 00:59:38.879
<i>Do you want me to come</i>
<i>and take care of you?</i>

1007
00:59:38.915 --> 00:59:41.547
<i>It's only a three-hour drive.</i>
<i>It's really--</i>

1008
00:59:41.582 --> 00:59:43.352
No.
No. it's fine.

1009
00:59:43.387 --> 00:59:45.623
I wouldn't wanna expose you.

1010
00:59:50.789 --> 00:59:53.257
<i>Have you told your mom?</i>

1011
00:59:55.257 --> 00:59:56.928
I just-- I don't
wanna worry her.

1012
00:59:56.964 --> 01:00:00.427
and. like. have her
calling me like...

1013
01:00:00.462 --> 01:00:02.805
<i> Terese.</i>
<i>you're gonna be fine.</i>

1014
01:00:38.238 --> 01:00:40.136
<i> Right about now</i>
<i>would be a great time</i>

1015
01:00:40.172 --> 01:00:42.405
<i>for my test results</i>
<i>to come back.</i>

1016
01:00:54.387 --> 01:00:57.956
<i>Well. at least I don't</i>
<i>have it that bad.</i>

1017
01:00:57.991 --> 01:01:00.361
<i>Maybe I got away</i>
<i>with a mild case.</i>

1018
01:01:03.494 --> 01:01:06.997
<i>I've managed to not have</i>
<i>a mental breakdown today.</i>

1019
01:01:07.033 --> 01:01:09.663
<i>I'd like to keep</i>
<i>that streak up.</i>

1020
01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:21.816
<i>There is nothing more</i>
<i>infurating</i>

1021
01:01:21.851 --> 01:01:23.783
<i>than watching young.</i>
<i>dumb people flaunt</i>

1022
01:01:23.819 --> 01:01:25.786
<i>parties and bars</i>
<i>on social media</i>

1023
01:01:25.822 --> 01:01:28.988
<i>in the middle</i>
<i>of a fucking plague.</i>

1024
01:01:29.023 --> 01:01:31.123
<i>I barely go out.</i>
<i>and I don't see anyone.</i>

1025
01:01:31.158 --> 01:01:33.528
<i>but I still somehow got COVID</i>
<i>from. like.</i>

1026
01:01:33.564 --> 01:01:36.129
<i>running errands or something.</i>

1027
01:01:36.164 --> 01:01:38.698
<i>And these idiots probably</i>
<i>won't even get infected</i>

1028
01:01:38.733 --> 01:01:41.065
<i>because karma is a bitch.</i>

1029
01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:43.433
<i>And not in the way</i>
<i>I want it to be.</i>

1030
01:01:51.747 --> 01:01:53.575
<i>It's been six days.</i>

1031
01:01:53.610 --> 01:01:56.446
<i>Where the fuck are</i>
<i>those fucking test results?</i>

1032
01:02:06.863 --> 01:02:08.432
<i> Hello. LA County</i>
<i>testing site.</i>

1033
01:02:08.467 --> 01:02:10.862
<i>-This is Terrence.</i>
-Yeah. hi.

1034
01:02:10.897 --> 01:02:13.900
Um. I got tested on Thursday.

1035
01:02:13.936 --> 01:02:15.971
and I still haven't gotten
my results.

1036
01:02:16.007 --> 01:02:17.372
<i> Okay. yeah.</i>
<i>so we're pretty overwhelmed</i>

1037
01:02:17.407 --> 01:02:18.773
<i>at the moment.</i>

1038
01:02:18.809 --> 01:02:19.904
<i>I can't look</i>
<i>into anything for you</i>

1039
01:02:19.939 --> 01:02:21.779
<i>unless it's been seven days.</i>

1040
01:02:23.481 --> 01:02:25.539
Yeah. I just feel really awful.

1041
01:02:25.574 --> 01:02:29.544
and I really need to know
if I have COVID.

1042
01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:32.116
<i> Yeah. well.</i>
<i>if your symptoms worsen.</i>

1043
01:02:32.151 --> 01:02:33.886
<i>you should seek</i>
<i>professional help</i>

1044
01:02:33.922 --> 01:02:35.854
<i>and go to an ER</i>
<i>if you start...</i>

1045
01:02:35.889 --> 01:02:36.854
Having trouble breathing.

1046
01:02:36.889 --> 01:02:37.888
Yeah. thanks. Terrence.

1047
01:02:37.923 --> 01:02:39.621
Really fucking helpful.

1048
01:02:44.002 --> 01:02:46.463
I probably should have said
that last part in my head.

1049
01:02:57.843 --> 01:02:59.644
Aww.
Poor baby.

1050
01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:01.041
Are you drunk?

1051
01:03:01.077 --> 01:03:02.717
No.

1052
01:03:02.752 --> 01:03:05.020
-Gas station sushi.

1053
01:03:05.818 --> 01:03:07.424
Can I help you?

1054
01:03:07.459 --> 01:03:08.922
Or do you need-- I don't know--

1055
01:03:08.957 --> 01:03:10.754
do you need more soy sauce.
wasabi?

1056
01:03:28.612 --> 01:03:30.107
<i>I'm not gonna die.</i>

1057
01:03:30.142 --> 01:03:31.578
<i>I'm not gonna die.</i>

1058
01:03:31.614 --> 01:03:33.239
<i>I'm not gonna die.</i>

1059
01:03:33.275 --> 01:03:34.845
<i>I'm not gonna die.</i>

1060
01:03:41.850 --> 01:03:45.926
<i>I thought if I just lived</i>
<i>my life how I wanted to.</i>

1061
01:03:45.961 --> 01:03:48.525
<i>it would be worth</i>
<i>it in the end.</i>

1062
01:03:51.627 --> 01:03:54.161
<i>I'm not ready for it</i>
<i>to be the end.</i>

1063
01:04:14.819 --> 01:04:16.058
Ow.

1064
01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:17.952
<i>Okay.</i>

1065
01:05:17.988 --> 01:05:20.347
<i>Okay. I was only out</i>
<i>for two minutes.</i>

1066
01:05:20.382 --> 01:05:22.124
<i>That's not too bad.</i>

1067
01:05:23.386 --> 01:05:26.491
<i>Or is it?</i>
<i>Oh. fuck.</i>

1068
01:05:27.391 --> 01:05:29.362
<i>What difference does it make?</i>

1069
01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:38.204
Hello?

1070
01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:40.274
<i> Hello.</i>
<i>This is Dr. Samuels.</i>

1071
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:43.439
<i>I'm on call tonight.</i>
<i>What seems to be the issue?</i>

1072
01:05:43.474 --> 01:05:46.783
Hello. uh. yeah.
I think I have COVID.

1073
01:05:46.819 --> 01:05:48.514
<i> Have you</i>
<i>been tested?</i>

1074
01:05:49.016 --> 01:05:50.982
Uh. yeah. about a week ago.

1075
01:05:51.017 --> 01:05:52.847
It hasn't come back yet.

1076
01:05:53.926 --> 01:05:57.456
Um. but I've had a fever
and symptoms all week.

1077
01:05:57.491 --> 01:06:01.422
Um. and I have a really tight
pressure on my chest.

1078
01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:03.963
Um. and my hands are tingly.

1079
01:06:03.998 --> 01:06:07.130
And I think I just passed out.

1080
01:06:07.165 --> 01:06:08.467
<i> You think?</i>

1081
01:06:11.443 --> 01:06:13.944
I did.
I did.

1082
01:06:13.979 --> 01:06:16.145
<i> And you're</i>
<i>a CF patient. right?</i>

1083
01:06:17.814 --> 01:06:20.940
-Yes
-<i> Okay.</i>

1084
01:06:20.976 --> 01:06:22.742
<i>I think we should bring you in</i>
<i>to check you out</i>

1085
01:06:22.778 --> 01:06:24.646
<i>and see if you need</i>
<i>to be admitted.</i>

1086
01:06:24.682 --> 01:06:26.579
<i>We'll be able to test you</i>
<i>again for COVID</i>

1087
01:06:26.614 --> 01:06:28.288
<i>as well as a fall flu panel.</i>

1088
01:06:28.324 --> 01:06:31.092
<i>But you just passed out.</i>
<i>so I wouldn't recommend</i>

1089
01:06:31.127 --> 01:06:33.625
<i>for you to operate</i>
<i>a vehicle right now.</i>

1090
01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:36.363
<i>Do you have anyone who could</i>
<i>bring you to the hospital?</i>

1091
01:07:00.856 --> 01:07:02.257
Why didn't you tell me?

1092
01:07:04.486 --> 01:07:06.228
That you were sick?

1093
01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:11.134
I didn't tell anyone.

1094
01:07:12.163 --> 01:07:15.004
Well. except Syd.

1095
01:07:15.039 --> 01:07:18.207
It must be so scary for you.

1096
01:07:21.942 --> 01:07:24.378
Yeah.
It is.

1097
01:07:25.181 --> 01:07:27.907
That's partially why
I didn't tell anyone

1098
01:07:27.942 --> 01:07:31.985
because everyone telling me
how scary it is

1099
01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:34.223
doesn't make it any less scary.

1100
01:07:36.526 --> 01:07:38.128
Sorry.

1101
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:42.099
It's okay.

1102
01:07:47.433 --> 01:07:49.397
Why didn't you tell me
about Zack

1103
01:07:49.432 --> 01:07:51.174
right when you got back?

1104
01:07:52.542 --> 01:07:54.939
Uh...

1105
01:07:54.975 --> 01:07:58.204
I thought that

1106
01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:03.048
if I made a big deal out of it.
then it would have been real.

1107
01:08:03.083 --> 01:08:05.345
And also-- --

1108
01:08:05.381 --> 01:08:07.190
we don't talk.

1109
01:08:09.384 --> 01:08:10.888
We could.

1110
01:08:10.924 --> 01:08:13.093
Could we?

1111
01:08:13.129 --> 01:08:14.927
I know I didn't know you
that well

1112
01:08:14.962 --> 01:08:16.692
before I moved in.

1113
01:08:16.728 --> 01:08:21.133
but you never tried very hard
to change that.

1114
01:08:21.735 --> 01:08:25.208
And then things got so tense
when I came back from Zack's.

1115
01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:31.814
You just...didn't understand.

1116
01:08:33.743 --> 01:08:36.377
You're right.
I didn't un--

1117
01:08:36.413 --> 01:08:38.353
I don't understand.

1118
01:08:40.421 --> 01:08:44.524
You've always acted like CF
was no big deal.

1119
01:08:46.856 --> 01:08:49.463
You never actually told me
what it was.

1120
01:08:53.832 --> 01:08:57.130
I'm not good at. like.
explaining the science of it.

1121
01:08:59.835 --> 01:09:02.908
And you're not even
from Arizona.

1122
01:09:09.315 --> 01:09:12.347
Sorry.
Sorry about that.

1123
01:09:12.382 --> 01:09:14.818
Um...

1124
01:09:19.323 --> 01:09:21.154
I guess I just...

1125
01:09:22.333 --> 01:09:26.665
I envy how little you have
to care about all of this.

1126
01:09:29.331 --> 01:09:30.964
I know.

1127
01:09:30.999 --> 01:09:34.306
I wish I could go out
and see my friends.

1128
01:09:34.341 --> 01:09:37.278
Go to restaurants
and just...

1129
01:09:37.313 --> 01:09:41.251
feel invincible like
everybody else I know.

1130
01:09:42.345 --> 01:09:43.880
But I'm not.

1131
01:09:45.252 --> 01:09:48.291
I've never been invincible.

1132
01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:51.360
Especially now.

1133
01:09:57.331 --> 01:09:59.698
Bye.
Thanks again.

1134
01:10:05.671 --> 01:10:07.836
<i> Your oxygen</i>
<i>and EKG look good.</i>

1135
01:10:07.871 --> 01:10:09.736
<i>and your chest x-ray</i>
<i>is actually better</i>

1136
01:10:09.771 --> 01:10:11.109
<i>than the last time you had one.</i>

1137
01:10:11.144 --> 01:10:12.643
<i> Okay.</i>

1138
01:10:12.678 --> 01:10:14.348
<i> So I feel fine</i>
<i>to send you home.</i>

1139
01:10:14.384 --> 01:10:16.317
<i>You probably passed out</i>
<i>from dehydration.</i>

1140
01:10:16.352 --> 01:10:18.154
<i>Just keep drinking plenty</i>
<i>of fluids.</i>

1141
01:10:18.189 --> 01:10:19.650
<i>We should have</i>
<i>your results tomorrow.</i>

1142
01:10:19.685 --> 01:10:21.022
<i>Someone from the clinic</i>
<i>will call you.</i>

1143
01:10:21.057 --> 01:10:22.221
<i>and we will go from there.</i>

1144
01:10:22.257 --> 01:10:24.023
<i> Okay.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

1145
01:10:51.985 --> 01:10:53.086
Hello?

1146
01:10:53.121 --> 01:10:54.253
<i> Hey. Terese.</i>

1147
01:10:54.288 --> 01:10:56.759
<i>It's Angela from the CF Clinic.</i>

1148
01:10:56.795 --> 01:10:58.851
<i>How are you doing?</i>

1149
01:10:58.887 --> 01:11:01.555
Um. I'm all right.
I'm tired.

1150
01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:03.099
<i> Yeah.</i>

1151
01:11:03.135 --> 01:11:05.225
<i>I heard you had a late night</i>
<i>at ATC.</i>

1152
01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:08.203
<i>That's why I'm calling.</i>
<i>Your test results came back!</i>

1153
01:11:08.239 --> 01:11:12.609
<i>And let me just</i>
<i>pull them up here...</i>

1154
01:11:12.644 --> 01:11:14.074
<i>Let's see.</i>

1155
01:11:14.109 --> 01:11:17.109
<i>I think it's in here...</i>

1156
01:11:17.144 --> 01:11:19.442
<i>And you are...</i>

1157
01:11:19.477 --> 01:11:21.750
<i>negative for COVID!</i>

1158
01:11:21.785 --> 01:11:23.320
Oh. my God.

1159
01:11:24.579 --> 01:11:26.180
Oh. my God.

1160
01:11:27.090 --> 01:11:28.418
Oh. my God. so what do I have?

1161
01:11:28.453 --> 01:11:29.952
What's wrong with me?

1162
01:11:29.988 --> 01:11:34.092
<i> You did test positive</i>
<i>for rhinovirus.</i>

1163
01:11:34.127 --> 01:11:35.728
Rhinovirus?

1164
01:11:36.967 --> 01:11:38.968
<i> You had a cold?</i>

1165
01:11:39.003 --> 01:11:40.661
Yeah.

1166
01:11:40.697 --> 01:11:43.234
I just had a fucking cold!

1167
01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:44.836
Just a fucking cold.

1168
01:11:44.871 --> 01:11:47.675
Worst cold of my life.
but. like. it wasn't COVID.

1169
01:11:47.711 --> 01:11:48.945
Yet.

1170
01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:50.144
<i> Wait. don't say that!</i>

1171
01:11:50.179 --> 01:11:52.811
-<i> Please.</i>

1172
01:11:53.312 --> 01:11:54.777
Yeah. I know.

1173
01:11:54.812 --> 01:11:56.578
I was already taking
very few risks.

1174
01:11:56.614 --> 01:11:58.988
but this has convinced me

1175
01:11:59.023 --> 01:12:01.257
to be just a complete hermit

1176
01:12:01.292 --> 01:12:02.917
and never go outside ever again
in my life.

1177
01:12:02.952 --> 01:12:05.126
<i>Ah. good.</i>
<i>I'm glad to hear it.</i>

1178
01:12:05.161 --> 01:12:07.826
<i>'Cause you can't die before me.</i>

1179
01:12:07.861 --> 01:12:10.697
<i> Should I tell her</i>
<i>I probably will anyway?</i>

1180
01:12:13.165 --> 01:12:14.597
<i>No.</i>

1181
01:12:14.632 --> 01:12:16.370
<i>No need to sour the mood.</i>

1182
01:12:16.406 --> 01:12:18.705
<i>I'll be very kind to her</i>
<i>in my will.</i>

1183
01:12:19.737 --> 01:12:21.508
It's so funny though.

1184
01:12:21.543 --> 01:12:24.110
The irony in getting
another viral illness

1185
01:12:24.145 --> 01:12:25.880
during a padnemic.

1186
01:12:25.916 --> 01:12:28.046
Like--

1187
01:12:30.417 --> 01:12:33.321
Oh. my God.
Oh. my God.

1188
01:12:33.356 --> 01:12:35.550
Syd. I coughed.
and I didn't die though.

1189
01:12:35.585 --> 01:12:37.592
I broke the trope.

1190
01:12:39.664 --> 01:12:41.062
<i>What?</i>

1191
01:12:41.097 --> 01:12:42.558
Nothing.
Never mind.

1192
01:12:42.593 --> 01:12:44.065
I'll tell you sometime.

1193
01:12:46.933 --> 01:12:50.231
<i> Dude. where did</i>
<i>rhinovirus even come from?</i>

1194
01:12:51.434 --> 01:12:52.869
Oof.

1195
01:12:52.904 --> 01:12:55.472
Some guy probably
got freaky at the zoo.

1196
01:12:56.575 --> 01:12:58.344
<i> Back to normal now.</i>

1197
01:12:58.379 --> 01:13:00.082
<i>Well. as normal as normal is</i>

1198
01:13:00.117 --> 01:13:01.314
<i>when there's a global pandemic.</i>

No!
It's a pandemic. Mom.

1241
01:15:26.858 --> 01:15:28.888
Where am I about to go?

1242
01:15:28.923 --> 01:15:30.729
<i>Ah.</i>
<i>Well.</i>

1243
01:15:30.765 --> 01:15:32.630

<i>bougie?</i>

1247
01:15:45.212 --> 01:15:48.316
You say bougie in LA. you don't
know what you're in for. Mom.

1248
01:15:48.352 --> 01:15:50.587
-But thank you.

1249
01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:53.282
<i>Anything new. sweetheart?</i>

1250
01:15:53.924 --> 01:15:56.890
Uh...no.

1251
01:15:58.188 --> 01:16:02.222
Well. I did have a bit
of a cold actually.

1252
01:16:02.258 --> 01:16:03.494
<i>You don't think it's COVID.</i>
<i>do you?</i>

1253
01:16:03.529 --> 01:16:04.528
Nope.
Nope.

1254
01:16:04.563 --> 01:16:05.896
Made sure of that.

1255
01:16:05.931 --> 01:16:08.195
I got tested.
It came back negative.

1256
01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:09.996
And I've been feeling
a lot better

1257
01:16:10.032 --> 01:16:12.273
as of recently too. so...

1258
01:16:12.308 --> 01:16:14.738
<i>Oh. that's a relief!</i>

1259
01:16:14.773 --> 01:16:17.009
Yeah.
Tell me about it.

1260
01:16:19.441 --> 01:16:23.510
You know. but I've been
really good actually.

1261
01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:27.384
Applying for a job
I might actually like.

1262
01:16:28.824 --> 01:16:31.157
I'm getting it through a friend.
so we'll see.

1263
01:16:31.593 --> 01:16:33.586
Oh. my gosh.
Guess what I did.

1264
01:16:35.166 --> 01:16:37.394
I tried to make bread.

1265
01:16:39.765 --> 01:16:41.294

<i>-Yeah!</i>
<i>-Happy birthday. Terese!</i>

1270
01:16:52.843 --> 01:16:54.879
<i>-Nice.</i>
-Thank you!

1271
01:16:54.914 --> 01:16:57.553
I'm just 23.
It's not that exciting.

1272
01:16:57.588 --> 01:16:59.080
<i> Hey. it's</i>
<i>your Jordan birthday!</i>

1273
01:16:59.115 --> 01:17:01.213
-<i> That's right!</i>
-Wow.

1274
01:17:01.248 --> 01:17:03.757
If only I cared about sports.

1275
01:17:03.793 --> 01:17:07.728
Still. this is kind of. like.
anticlimactic.

1276
01:17:07.764 --> 01:17:10.431
<i> Uh. how much</i>
<i>is that edible again?</i>

1277
01:17:10.466 --> 01:17:12.730
50 milligrams?
100 maybe?

1278
01:17:12.766 --> 01:17:15.468
Oh. I should know that.

1279
01:17:15.503 --> 01:17:16.703
<i> Oh. my God.</i>

1280
01:17:16.738 --> 01:17:18.133
-I should know that.
-<i> Ugh.</i>

1281
01:17:18.168 --> 01:17:19.675
<i>You could've just said</i>
<i>"Fuck it"</i>

1282
01:17:19.710 --> 01:17:22.075
<i>and gone to some outdoor bar</i>
<i>or something.</i>

1283
01:17:22.111 --> 01:17:23.807
Mm.

1284
01:17:23.842 --> 01:17:26.840
What a privilege.
I wish!

1285
01:17:26.876 --> 01:17:28.408
I'm good though.

1286
01:17:28.443 --> 01:17:30.578
<i>Well. you already</i>
<i>survived COVID once.</i>

1287
01:17:30.613 --> 01:17:33.121
<i>None of us would want you</i>
<i>to take that chance again.</i>

1288
01:17:33.156 --> 01:17:34.851
Mm.

1289
01:17:34.887 --> 01:17:37.351
<i>Yeah. I don't think any of us</i>

1290
01:17:37.387 --> 01:17:40.026
<i>should be taking those kind</i>
<i>of chances.</i>

1291
01:17:44.364 --> 01:17:45.629
Yeah.

1292
01:17:45.665 --> 01:17:48.199
That was<i> definitely</i>

1293
01:17:48.234 --> 01:17:51.532
enough excitement to last me
the rest of quarantine.

1294
01:17:52.468 --> 01:17:56.670
And enough fear for the rest
of my life. so...

1295
01:17:56.706 --> 01:17:59.373
<i> Wait. I thought you</i>
<i>didn't end up having COVID.</i>

1296
01:17:59.408 --> 01:18:01.650
<i>She didn't.</i>
<i>She's just hella dramatic.</i>

1297
01:18:01.686 --> 01:18:03.014
-No. I thought I had it!

1298
01:18:03.049 --> 01:18:04.649
Which means I don't wanna
actually get it

1299
01:18:04.685 --> 01:18:05.849
and go through that again.

1300
01:18:05.885 --> 01:18:07.956
<i> Hey. that will not happen.</i>

1301
01:18:07.992 --> 01:18:10.760
<i>Because I refuse to believe</i>
<i>the world can be that cruel.</i>

1302
01:18:11.526 --> 01:18:14.228
<i> Mm.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

1303
01:18:14.264 --> 01:18:15.830
Here's hoping.

1304
01:18:15.866 --> 01:18:17.994

1309
01:18:23.365 --> 01:18:25.030

1310
01:18:25.066 --> 01:18:26.174

01:18:27.412 --> 01:18:28.373
<i>Oh. my God.</i>
<i>She's gone.</i>

1313
01:18:29.746 --> 01:18:31.306
