3
00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:43.177
Stop.

4
00:00:43.311 --> 00:00:44.945
- I'll stop if you just
explain it to me.

5
00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:46.514
-because I don't...
-Would you please just drop it?

6
00:00:46.647 --> 00:00:47.981
- All right. all right.
fine. fine. fine. fine.

7
00:00:48.116 --> 00:00:49.117
Consider it dropped.
It's dropped.

8
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.252
-It's on the ground.
-Good.

9
00:00:52.253 --> 00:00:54.122
But. I mean. come on.
everybody loves birthdays.

10
00:00:54.255 --> 00:00:55.989
-You got decorations.

11
00:00:56.124 --> 00:00:57.991
You got balloons.
You got parties and cake.

12
00:00:58.126 --> 00:00:59.627
Look. I don't need presents.

13
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.763
I don't want decorations.
and I'm-I'm not a cake guy.

14
00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:04.732
Seriously. though.
you don't like cake?

15
00:01:04.865 --> 00:01:06.734
Name one food better than cake.

16
00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:08.001
Guinea pig.

17
00:01:08.136 --> 00:01:09.870
Oh. again with the guinea pig.

18
00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:11.939
I bet if I blindfolded you.

19
00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:13.774
you wouldn't be able
to tell the difference

20
00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:15.743
between a skunk
and a guinea pig.

21
00:01:15.876 --> 00:01:18.546
Wrong. Snakes have
impeccable taste buds.

22
00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:20.681
-I can taste air.
-Air?

23
00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:22.316
Yes. Air.

24
00:01:23.751 --> 00:01:25.286
Mm. Nice.

25
00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:27.588
I don't know.
They're a little. uh...

26
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:29.257
a little cute for my taste.

27
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.592
That's what makes them
so delicious.

28
00:01:31.725 --> 00:01:33.494
You're not just eating food.

29
00:01:33.627 --> 00:01:35.363
You're eating pure goodness.

30
00:01:35.496 --> 00:01:36.930
It's not about the pig.

31
00:01:37.064 --> 00:01:40.434
It's about what it symbolizes
on a deeper level.

32
00:01:41.769 --> 00:01:43.137
So. you can...
you can taste air?

33
00:01:43.271 --> 00:01:44.538
-What else you got?

34
00:01:44.672 --> 00:01:45.839
-Forget about it.
-W-W-Wait.

35
00:01:45.973 --> 00:01:47.541
-Can you also hear color?

36
00:01:47.675 --> 00:01:49.543
-Can you see sound?
-All right. all right. Okay.

37
00:01:49.677 --> 00:01:51.745
'Cause we should really be
capitalizing on these skills.

38
00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:53.614
Okay. all right. fine.
Get it all out.

39
00:01:53.747 --> 00:01:54.948
-Get it all out now.
-Okay. okay.

40
00:01:56.684 --> 00:01:58.252
Look at that.- 00 p.m.

41
00:01:58.386 --> 00:02:00.621
Now I know the exact moment
our friendship died.

42
00:02:02.723 --> 00:02:04.458
-Let's bounce.
-Yep.

43
00:02:05.693 --> 00:02:09.029
Tastes like. um. you're gonna
stick me with the bill-- again.

44
00:02:09.163 --> 00:02:10.931
-Well. it is my birthday.

45
00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:12.733
So now you play
the birthday card?

46
00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:14.568
-That's interesting.

47
00:02:14.702 --> 00:02:18.005
Can we get a check. please.
when you get a chance?

48
00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:21.041
Hello? Checkity-check-check.

49
00:02:21.175 --> 00:02:22.676
-You know what?

50
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.113
We're just gonna leave
the money right here. okay?

51
00:02:26.247 --> 00:02:27.981
You know the one good thing
about this place?

52
00:02:28.115 --> 00:02:29.883
-What? -We never have to wait
for a table.

53
00:02:30.017 --> 00:02:31.319
Well. isn't that every place?

54
00:02:31.452 --> 00:02:33.020
Hey. man. How you been?
I haven't seen you in...

55
00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:35.155
-Snake attack!

56
00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:36.857
Oh. Mints.

57
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.726
Sorry. folks.
I'm switching him to decaf.

58
00:02:40.328 --> 00:02:41.462
All right.

59
00:02:41.595 --> 00:02:43.231
-- Let's do this.

60
00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.611
Guinea pig. huh?

61
00:02:57.745 --> 00:02:59.613
It's the Rolls-Royce of rodents.

62
00:02:59.747 --> 00:03:01.382
Yeah. but it's still a rodent.

63
00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:03.351
You know what I mean?

64
00:03:03.484 --> 00:03:05.519
-Don't mind us. just robbing
this place. -

65
00:03:19.467 --> 00:03:20.668
Whoo! Yeah!

66
00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:22.503
-Go bad...
-Or go home.

67
00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:31.011
Hey. you. Get over here.

68
00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:33.614
Little bit closer.

69
00:03:33.747 --> 00:03:36.049
Oh. I know what it is.

70
00:03:36.183 --> 00:03:39.853
You're afraid because
I'm the... the Big Bad Wolf.

71
00:03:39.987 --> 00:03:41.655
Well. I'm not surprised.

72
00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:43.557
I am the villain in every story.

73
00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:44.792
Isn't that right. Mr. Snake?

74
00:03:44.925 --> 00:03:46.193
Yep.

75
00:03:46.327 --> 00:03:49.297
Say hello to Mr. Snake.

76
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.231
Serpentine.
safe-cracking machine.

77
00:03:51.365 --> 00:03:53.467
Imagine Houdini
but with no arms.

78
00:03:53.601 --> 00:03:55.603
Kind of guy who'd tell you
the glass is half empty.

79
00:03:55.736 --> 00:03:57.004
then steal it from you.

80
00:03:57.137 --> 00:03:58.506
He's also my best bud.

81
00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.974
And today's his birthday!

82
00:04:01.108 --> 00:04:03.176
-Not relevant.
-He's a sweetheart.

83
00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:04.978
-You're a sweetheart.

84
00:04:05.112 --> 00:04:07.180
Well. look who's here.

85
00:04:07.315 --> 00:04:09.950
-Took 'em long enough.

86
00:04:13.921 --> 00:04:15.823
Watch this.

87
00:04:15.956 --> 00:04:17.558
Three.

88
00:04:17.691 --> 00:04:19.593
Two. One.

89
00:04:21.128 --> 00:04:22.796
And over here is Ms. Tarantula.

90
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.265
our in-house hacker.
our pocket search engine.

91
00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:26.867
our traveling tech wizard.

92
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.702
We call her Webs.

93
00:04:34.842 --> 00:04:35.943
Very slick. Webs.

94
00:04:36.076 --> 00:04:37.311
I also took over
the police dispatch.

95
00:04:37.445 --> 00:04:38.912
blurred their satellite
imaging system.

96
00:04:39.046 --> 00:04:40.314
grounded their chopper.

97
00:04:40.448 --> 00:04:42.082
And one more thing.

98
00:04:42.215 --> 00:04:43.250
You didn't.

99
00:04:43.384 --> 00:04:44.952
I got a special delivery for...

100
00:04:45.085 --> 00:04:46.253
Ah! Ooh! Don't eat me!

101
00:04:46.387 --> 00:04:48.356
Please! Don't eat me!

102
00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:51.024
Happy birthday.
Mr. Grumpy Pants.

103
00:04:51.158 --> 00:04:52.860
I think I hate you.

104
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.041
Guys. it's me.

105
00:05:08.175 --> 00:05:09.810
I was the construction worker.

106
00:05:09.943 --> 00:05:11.879
And this is Mr. Shark.

107
00:05:12.012 --> 00:05:13.514
master of disguise.

108
00:05:13.647 --> 00:05:16.550
apex predator
of a thousand faces.

109
00:05:17.718 --> 00:05:19.319
His greatest trick:
stealing the Mona Lisa

110
00:05:19.453 --> 00:05:22.289
-disguised as the Mona Lisa.

111
00:05:22.423 --> 00:05:23.491
Dig that.

112
00:05:23.624 --> 00:05:24.925
Watch it. big tuna.

113
00:05:25.058 --> 00:05:26.159
I'm trying to work here.

114
00:05:26.293 --> 00:05:27.761
Keep it cool. baby.

115
00:05:27.895 --> 00:05:29.563
Birthdays should be chill.

116
00:05:30.864 --> 00:05:32.466
And rounding out the crew...

117
00:05:34.702 --> 00:05:35.869
Surprise!

118
00:05:37.304 --> 00:05:38.806
...is Mr. Piranha.

119
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.075
He's a loose cannon
with a short fuse.

120
00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:44.111
willing to scrap
with anyone or anything.

121
00:05:44.244 --> 00:05:45.913
-He's brave.

122
00:05:46.046 --> 00:05:48.248
-He's fearless.

123
00:05:48.382 --> 00:05:50.317
Uh. who am I kidding?
He's crazy.

124
00:05:50.451 --> 00:05:53.153
Santo cielo.
that's a lot of po-po.

125
00:05:53.286 --> 00:05:56.857
Uh. Piranha.
did we forget something?

126
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.659
-What?
-The present.

127
00:05:58.792 --> 00:06:00.428
-You know.
-Oh. um...

128
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:02.730
Of-of course I didn't forget.

129
00:06:02.863 --> 00:06:05.198
--You know you fart
when you lie. right?

130
00:06:05.332 --> 00:06:06.967
What? No. I fart
when I'm nervous.

131
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.402
Yeah. Nervous about lying.

132
00:06:08.536 --> 00:06:10.203
-I'm sorry.

133
00:06:10.337 --> 00:06:11.872
-- Piranha!

134
00:06:12.005 --> 00:06:13.373
Don't breathe it in.

135
00:06:13.507 --> 00:06:14.742
-I breathed it in!

136
00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:16.477
Yeah. they're a bit eccentric.

137
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.311
but when you're born us.
you don't exactly win

138
00:06:18.446 --> 00:06:20.080
many popularity contests.

139
00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:22.516
-Shark!
-- Shark!

140
00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.118
Do I wish people
didn't see us as monsters?

141
00:06:25.252 --> 00:06:26.620
Eight legs.
eight times the cardio.

142
00:06:26.754 --> 00:06:27.755
Monster!

143
00:06:27.888 --> 00:06:29.557
-- Sure. I do.
-What's up. papa?

144
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:30.824
- But these are
the cards we've been dealt.

145
00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.392
so we might as well play 'em.

146
00:06:32.526 --> 00:06:33.794
Jackpot!

147
00:06:33.927 --> 00:06:35.295
Yes!

148
00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:47.107
Um...

149
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.809
-What the thorax?
-Are you crazy?

150
00:06:48.942 --> 00:06:51.579
What? I just wanted
a longer car chase.

151
00:06:51.712 --> 00:06:53.246
It's the best part.

152
00:06:56.049 --> 00:06:57.485
Chief! It's...

153
00:06:57.618 --> 00:06:59.086
Them.

154
00:07:00.688 --> 00:07:02.022
Webs. hit it.

155
00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:06.694
Get them!

156
00:07:40.494 --> 00:07:42.295
I'm gonna put you guys away
for so long.

157
00:07:42.429 --> 00:07:44.865
your fleas will have fleas.

158
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.204
Chief. You want some cake?

159
00:07:51.338 --> 00:07:53.774
-You seem a little hangry.

160
00:07:53.907 --> 00:07:55.375
Get that thing
out of my face before I...

161
00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:58.145
-Excuse me. Chief.
-What?

162
00:08:12.392 --> 00:08:13.761
You're mine.

163
00:08:18.899 --> 00:08:20.734
Hermano.

164
00:08:48.929 --> 00:08:51.264
Yeah. we may be bad.

165
00:08:51.398 --> 00:08:53.066
but we're so good at it.

166
00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.375
Oh. no. no. no. no. no. no. no!

167
00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:04.544
Keep running. Wolf!

168
00:09:04.678 --> 00:09:07.748
One of these days.
your luck is gonna run out!

169
00:09:36.777 --> 00:09:39.713
All right. Piranha. you're up.

170
00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.255
-Seriously?
-- Snake. come on.

171
00:09:48.388 --> 00:09:50.090
-At least make a toast.

172
00:09:50.223 --> 00:09:51.558
-Toast! Come on!
-Come on.

173
00:09:51.692 --> 00:09:53.060
-- Okay. okay. All right.
A toast. -Whoo!

174
00:09:53.193 --> 00:09:54.662
Fine.

175
00:09:54.795 --> 00:09:57.865
I've made a lot of enemies
in my time-- I mean. a lot--

176
00:09:57.998 --> 00:10:01.001
but out of all the people
in the world.

177
00:10:01.134 --> 00:10:02.636
I hate you guys the least.

178
00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:04.304
-Aw. -That was actually
kind of beautiful.

179
00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:05.839
You're a poet. man.

180
00:10:05.973 --> 00:10:09.743
To Mr. Snake and his strange
dislike of birthdays.

181
00:10:09.877 --> 00:10:12.245
-- Yay!

182
00:10:12.379 --> 00:10:14.848
Everyone say. "Robbery."

183
00:10:14.982 --> 00:10:16.383
Robbery.

184
00:10:16.516 --> 00:10:17.818
Oh.

185
00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:19.787
Look at those dimples.

186
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.655
-Happy birthday. buddy.
-Okay.

187
00:10:21.789 --> 00:10:23.590
-Now. dig in. fellas.
-Yes!

188
00:10:23.724 --> 00:10:25.659
-Piranha!

189
00:10:25.793 --> 00:10:27.160
-- Don't do that.

190
00:10:27.294 --> 00:10:28.428
That was so gross.

191
00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:30.030
That was my lunch!

192
00:10:30.163 --> 00:10:32.032
-- You snooze. you lose.

193
00:10:32.165 --> 00:10:34.567
-- You like that.

194
00:10:34.702 --> 00:10:36.369
Nice.

195
00:10:37.204 --> 00:10:39.106
-Ooh. wow.

196
00:10:39.239 --> 00:10:40.708
I forgot we had those Push Pops.

197
00:10:40.841 --> 00:10:43.443
Man. my tummy is rumbling
like a kraken right now.

198
00:10:43.576 --> 00:10:45.278
Yeah. Want it?

199
00:10:45.412 --> 00:10:47.447
You know he's not
gonna give it to you.

200
00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.449
No. I believe that deep down

201
00:10:49.582 --> 00:10:52.886
Snake is a kind
and generous soul.

202
00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.254
Why?

203
00:10:54.387 --> 00:10:56.223
Here. Take it.

204
00:10:56.356 --> 00:10:57.758
Oh. yeah!

205
00:10:57.891 --> 00:10:59.059
Pop me. please.

206
00:10:59.192 --> 00:11:00.961
-Ah...
-Ha!

207
00:11:01.094 --> 00:11:02.830
Sucker.

208
00:11:02.963 --> 00:11:06.266
Come on. man. Now you gonna
make me get all aggressive.

209
00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:08.268
-Animals.

210
00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:10.370
Spit it out! Spit it out!

211
00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:11.839
Never!

212
00:11:11.972 --> 00:11:13.606
Let's see what they're saying
about us today.

213
00:11:13.741 --> 00:11:15.408
What up? It's Tiffany Fluffit.
Channel 6 Action News.

214
00:11:15.542 --> 00:11:17.344
The Bad Guys
have struck again...

215
00:11:17.477 --> 00:11:20.447
Guys. guys. stop it.
We're on TV.

216
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.015
-Ooh. ooh!
-...proving once more that they

217
00:11:22.149 --> 00:11:24.584
are the most diabolical
criminals of our time.

218
00:11:24.718 --> 00:11:27.554
Ooh. "diabolical." That's new.

219
00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:29.222
Know what it sounds like?
A cologne.

220
00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:30.590
Diabolical.

221
00:11:30.724 --> 00:11:32.492
- To address
this heinous crime spree

222
00:11:32.625 --> 00:11:35.595
is the newly elected governor.
Diane Foxington.

223
00:11:35.729 --> 00:11:36.997
-Governor?
-- Okay. Yeah.

224
00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:38.899
-I hear you. I hear you.

225
00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:42.602
Listen. listen. We all know
how dastardly the Bad Guys are.

226
00:11:42.736 --> 00:11:45.672
-- You bet we are.
-But more than anything...

227
00:11:45.806 --> 00:11:48.275
I feel sorry for them.

228
00:11:48.408 --> 00:11:50.043
What?

229
00:11:50.177 --> 00:11:51.779
These so-called Bad Guys

230
00:11:51.912 --> 00:11:54.547
are really just
second-rate has-beens.

231
00:11:54.681 --> 00:11:56.583
Behind their amateurish antics

232
00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:58.852
and. frankly.
unoriginal capers--

233
00:11:58.986 --> 00:12:00.788
I mean. really. another bank?--

234
00:12:00.921 --> 00:12:03.223
is nothing but
a deep well of anger...

235
00:12:03.356 --> 00:12:04.624
I ain't angry! You're angry!

236
00:12:04.758 --> 00:12:06.393
-...denial...
-Not true.

237
00:12:06.526 --> 00:12:07.660
...and self-loathing.

238
00:12:07.795 --> 00:12:09.797
The only one I self-loathe
is you.

239
00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.265
And those are holes
that no amount of cash

240
00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:15.502
or priceless art can ever fill.

241
00:12:17.504 --> 00:12:19.572
What's on the Food Network?

242
00:12:19.706 --> 00:12:21.241
So. can we just forget about...

243
00:12:21.374 --> 00:12:22.843
Who-who is she to judge us?

244
00:12:22.976 --> 00:12:24.812
-- ...and focus on more
positive things? -

245
00:12:24.945 --> 00:12:26.479
And what could be more positive

246
00:12:26.613 --> 00:12:28.615
than the Annual
Good Samaritan Awards.

247
00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:31.718
where tomorrow night I will
present the Golden Dolphin

248
00:12:31.852 --> 00:12:35.188
to this year's goodest citizen?

249
00:12:35.322 --> 00:12:36.556
I can't believe I voted for her.

250
00:12:36.689 --> 00:12:37.958
You voted for her?

251
00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:40.627
- What?
She's good on climate change.

252
00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.395
Wait. What's going on?

253
00:12:42.529 --> 00:12:45.032
You've got that twinkle
in your eye.

254
00:12:46.867 --> 00:12:50.037
Guys. who's up for another job?

255
00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:51.438
A big one.

256
00:12:53.874 --> 00:12:55.675
The Golden Dolphin.

257
00:12:55.809 --> 00:12:57.310
-Seriously?
-Oh.

258
00:12:57.444 --> 00:12:58.946
I thought I was the crazy one.

259
00:12:59.079 --> 00:13:01.448
That job has broken
every criminal who's tried it.

260
00:13:01.581 --> 00:13:04.117
The Bucharest Bandits.
Lucky Jim.

261
00:13:04.251 --> 00:13:05.919
The Crimson Paw.

262
00:13:06.053 --> 00:13:07.754
Actually. the Crimson Paw
was never arrested.

263
00:13:07.888 --> 00:13:10.223
Yeah. but he never stole
anything again.

264
00:13:10.357 --> 00:13:11.959
Snake. what better way

265
00:13:12.092 --> 00:13:14.461
to wipe that smirk
off the governor's fuzzy face

266
00:13:14.594 --> 00:13:15.896
than stealing the Golden Dolphin

267
00:13:16.029 --> 00:13:17.898
from right under her whiskers?

268
00:13:18.031 --> 00:13:20.633
This is the Holy Grail
of thievery.

269
00:13:20.767 --> 00:13:22.836
If we pull this off.
we'll cement our legacy

270
00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:25.238
as the greatest criminals
of all time.

271
00:13:25.372 --> 00:13:26.874
Whoa. whoa. buddy.

272
00:13:27.007 --> 00:13:29.509
I thought we weren't supposed
to make things personal.

273
00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:31.544
Besides. we've got
a good thing going here.

274
00:13:31.678 --> 00:13:35.615
Friends. freedom.
and just look at this loot.

275
00:13:36.416 --> 00:13:37.717
All right. you're right.
Forget it.

276
00:13:37.851 --> 00:13:40.020
-The Dolphin job is off.
-Good.

277
00:13:40.153 --> 00:13:42.455
I guess the pig
will get his trophy after all.

278
00:13:42.589 --> 00:13:44.757
Yeah. I guess he would...

279
00:13:44.892 --> 00:13:46.493
What do you mean. "pig"?

280
00:13:46.626 --> 00:13:48.095
Oh. yes. did I not mention that?

281
00:13:48.228 --> 00:13:50.697
That's weird. I thought
I mentioned that it was. uh...

282
00:13:51.865 --> 00:13:53.233
The Good Samaritan is...

283
00:13:53.366 --> 00:13:54.534
A guinea pig?

284
00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:57.604
What do you say. Snakey?

285
00:13:57.737 --> 00:13:58.972
Better than cake.

286
00:13:59.106 --> 00:14:00.573
-- Right.

287
00:14:00.707 --> 00:14:03.376
Okay. Fine.

288
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:05.078
But he better be delicious.

289
00:14:05.212 --> 00:14:07.280
Are we all in this together?

290
00:14:09.416 --> 00:14:10.984
So here's the plan.

291
00:14:11.118 --> 00:14:13.353
Like every year.
the ceremony will be held

292
00:14:13.486 --> 00:14:15.155
at the Museum of Fine Arts.

293
00:14:15.288 --> 00:14:17.724
where the Golden Dolphin
will be positioned

294
00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:20.327
just beyond
the backstage curtain.

295
00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:21.661
Sounds easy.

296
00:14:21.794 --> 00:14:23.830
Sounds easy. hermano.
but to get there.

297
00:14:23.964 --> 00:14:26.199
we'll need to bypass
three levels of security.

298
00:14:26.333 --> 00:14:28.768
So. step one:
We'll need to blend in.

299
00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:38.845
Professor Marmalade.

300
00:14:38.979 --> 00:14:41.114
this year's recipient
of the Golden Dolphin.

301
00:14:41.248 --> 00:14:43.650
the most annoying good creature
on the planet.

302
00:14:43.783 --> 00:14:46.253
Professor. in the past year.
you've stopped wars.

303
00:14:46.386 --> 00:14:48.788
fed the hungry
and saved countless pandas.

304
00:14:48.922 --> 00:14:50.523
Some have described
your goodness

305
00:14:50.657 --> 00:14:52.592
as second only to Mother Teresa.

306
00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:55.162
Oh. Tiffany.
it's not a competition.

307
00:14:55.295 --> 00:14:57.730
And if it were. it would
really be more of a tie.

308
00:14:57.864 --> 00:15:00.934
But we can all agree that
there is a flower of goodness

309
00:15:01.068 --> 00:15:04.004
inside all of us.
just waiting to blossom.

310
00:15:04.137 --> 00:15:06.940
- Once inside.
there are two armored doors.

311
00:15:07.074 --> 00:15:09.276
The first can only be opened by

312
00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:11.044
a special key card
that is carried

313
00:15:11.178 --> 00:15:12.946
by our dear friend.
the chief of police.

314
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.948
The second is outfitted
with a retinal scanner

315
00:15:15.082 --> 00:15:17.750
and guarded by
an elite special ops unit

316
00:15:17.884 --> 00:15:20.387
trained to strike first
and ask questions later.

317
00:15:22.155 --> 00:15:24.357
Governor Foxington
is the only one

318
00:15:24.491 --> 00:15:26.326
who has clearance
to open the second door.

319
00:15:26.459 --> 00:15:28.728
So. step two:
She and I will need to get

320
00:15:28.861 --> 00:15:30.530
up close and personal.

321
00:15:30.663 --> 00:15:32.332
Enjoy your evening.
Mr. Ambassador.

322
00:15:32.465 --> 00:15:33.500
Thank you. ma'am.

323
00:15:33.633 --> 00:15:35.035
Interesting piece.

324
00:15:35.168 --> 00:15:38.571
Trashy. pointless
and pretentious.

325
00:15:38.705 --> 00:15:41.074
Hmm. They say that art reveals

326
00:15:41.208 --> 00:15:42.875
more about the viewer
than the artist.

327
00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:44.444
-Mister...

328
00:15:44.577 --> 00:15:46.613
Poodleton. Oliver Poodleton.

329
00:15:46.746 --> 00:15:47.714
Uh... okay.

330
00:15:47.847 --> 00:15:49.749
It's about time someone stood up

331
00:15:49.882 --> 00:15:52.119
to those diabolical Bad Guys.

332
00:15:52.252 --> 00:15:55.255
Though. I've got to say.
no one's succeeded yet.

333
00:15:55.388 --> 00:15:57.991
Eh. I don't think
it'll be that hard.

334
00:15:58.125 --> 00:16:00.127
I have a feeling it'll be
harder than you think.

335
00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.262
I'd say they're
one epic job away

336
00:16:02.395 --> 00:16:04.097
from cementing their legacy.

337
00:16:06.833 --> 00:16:08.568
Mr. Poodleton.
you're-you're funny.

338
00:16:08.701 --> 00:16:10.137
I am?

339
00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:12.539
The only legacy they're
cementing is life in prison.

340
00:16:12.672 --> 00:16:14.374
Did you see their last job?

341
00:16:14.507 --> 00:16:15.975
Ugh. Unsecured exits.

342
00:16:16.109 --> 00:16:18.378
crude disguises.
compulsive showboating.

343
00:16:18.511 --> 00:16:19.879
I mean. it was a mess.

344
00:16:20.013 --> 00:16:22.682
All the classic signs
of a crew in decline.

345
00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:25.752
Next. they're gonna
make it personal.

346
00:16:25.885 --> 00:16:28.388
That's when you know
they're toast.

347
00:16:29.256 --> 00:16:31.658
Uh. well. that's your opinion.

348
00:16:31.791 --> 00:16:34.327
It is. and I'm the governor.

349
00:16:35.228 --> 00:16:39.432
As for the sculpture.
I think it's about perspective.

350
00:16:39.566 --> 00:16:41.268
If you look closely enough.

351
00:16:41.401 --> 00:16:45.938
even trash can be recycled
into something beautiful.

352
00:16:46.073 --> 00:16:48.108
How about that?

353
00:16:48.241 --> 00:16:52.579
I guess some things
aren't always as they appear.

354
00:16:52.712 --> 00:16:53.913
That reminds me.

355
00:16:54.047 --> 00:16:55.715
May I? I can't miss a photo op

356
00:16:55.848 --> 00:16:57.350
with the governor
and a pile of garbage.

357
00:16:57.484 --> 00:17:00.920
Oh. Mr. Poodleton.
you're too hard on yourself.

358
00:17:01.054 --> 00:17:02.589
-Hey...

359
00:17:05.225 --> 00:17:06.693
Okay. friends.

360
00:17:06.826 --> 00:17:08.628
It's showtime.

361
00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:12.432
Once we're in.
it's on to step three:

362
00:17:12.565 --> 00:17:15.135
We split up
and we take our positions.

363
00:17:15.268 --> 00:17:18.838
Officers. if the Bad Guys
crash this event.

364
00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:20.940
I am definitely
going to lose my job.

365
00:17:21.074 --> 00:17:24.277
and I will not hesitate
to take you down with me.

366
00:17:24.411 --> 00:17:26.146
-Now. move out.
-- Yes. ma'am!

367
00:17:26.279 --> 00:17:27.814
Hut. hut. hut. hut.
hut. hut. hut. hut.

368
00:17:27.947 --> 00:17:29.649
hut. hut. hut. hut. hut.
hut. hut. hut. hut...

369
00:17:44.264 --> 00:17:46.533
Mic's on.
Everyone on comms. do you copy?

370
00:17:46.666 --> 00:17:47.767
-Copy.
-Copy. -Copy.

371
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.469
Copy.

372
00:18:08.121 --> 00:18:09.856
A drink for the pretty lady?

373
00:18:09.989 --> 00:18:12.625
No. thank you. My life is
too complicated right now.

374
00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:14.461
Uh. uh...

375
00:18:41.554 --> 00:18:43.590
Boys. it's Dolphin season.

376
00:18:46.693 --> 00:18:49.196
Copy that. I'm on the move.

377
00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:52.165
Unit two. is the backstage
area still secure?

378
00:18:52.299 --> 00:18:53.533
OFFICER
Unit two. All clear.

379
00:18:53.666 --> 00:18:55.968
This is where
all the training pays off.

380
00:18:56.102 --> 00:18:57.704
-Oh. pardon me.

381
00:18:57.837 --> 00:18:59.672
-Terribly sorry.
-Not a problem. sir.

382
00:18:59.806 --> 00:19:01.708
Keep your eyes open. boys.

383
00:19:01.841 --> 00:19:05.812
They could be anywhere.
just waiting to humiliate us.

384
00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:10.049
Wolf is in position.

385
00:19:10.183 --> 00:19:12.519
Piranha. you all
penguin-suited and booted?

386
00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:16.088
Affirmative. I'm a clean. mean.
Dolphin-stealing machine.

387
00:19:16.223 --> 00:19:18.124
What's going on. guys?

388
00:20:01.401 --> 00:20:03.503
-Here. let me help you.
-Ooh.

389
00:20:03.636 --> 00:20:04.871
Are you okay. ma'am?

390
00:20:05.004 --> 00:20:08.040
Oh. my gracious. yes.

391
00:20:08.174 --> 00:20:11.711
I may be dizzy. but I'm alive.
thanks to you.

392
00:20:11.844 --> 00:20:13.413
-- What are you...
-Oh.

393
00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:14.781
Mm.

394
00:20:16.483 --> 00:20:19.085
Thank you. dear.

395
00:20:19.886 --> 00:20:22.922
You're such a good boy.

396
00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:43.343
All good. brother?

397
00:20:43.476 --> 00:20:46.746
Yeah. all... a-all good.
Yeah. yeah.

398
00:20:46.879 --> 00:20:48.315
Um...

399
00:20:48.448 --> 00:20:50.917
Webs. what do you say about
moving on to step four?

400
00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:53.686
Copy that. Shark. you're up.

401
00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.988
-Do your thing.
-Do I get to improvise?

402
00:20:56.122 --> 00:20:58.024
Yes. fine. Improvise.

403
00:20:58.157 --> 00:20:59.792
But please be subtle.

404
00:20:59.926 --> 00:21:01.661
Mm-hmm.

405
00:21:03.195 --> 00:21:05.432
I'm having a baby!

406
00:21:05.565 --> 00:21:06.899
Is there a doctor?

407
00:21:07.033 --> 00:21:08.968
Or perhaps
several security guards

408
00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:10.903
that could leave their post
and help me?

409
00:21:31.023 --> 00:21:32.625
"Fish surprise"?

410
00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:35.495
Surprise!

411
00:21:42.669 --> 00:21:44.337
Hey. Webs.
can you enhance this...

412
00:21:44.471 --> 00:21:47.039
- Done. Eight steps
ahead of you. Wolfie.

413
00:21:54.447 --> 00:21:55.682
Ladies and gentlemen.

414
00:21:55.815 --> 00:21:58.751
your emcee for
the Good Samaritan Awards...

415
00:22:00.353 --> 00:22:02.188
WOLF
All right. Shark. we're in.

416
00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:04.391
Oops.
I forgot. I'm not pregnant.

417
00:22:04.524 --> 00:22:06.559
...president of the committee.

418
00:22:06.693 --> 00:22:08.995
Governor Diane Foxington.

419
00:22:09.128 --> 00:22:11.731
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

420
00:22:11.864 --> 00:22:14.033
Thank you.

421
00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:17.069
Last year.
we faced our biggest test

422
00:22:17.203 --> 00:22:20.673
when a meteorite crashed
into our dear city.

423
00:22:20.807 --> 00:22:23.776
That meteorite didn't just make
a hole in our city.

424
00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:25.778
It made a hole in our hearts.

425
00:22:25.912 --> 00:22:27.714
-- Aw.

426
00:22:27.847 --> 00:22:30.116
But even in tragedy.
Professor Marmalade.

427
00:22:30.249 --> 00:22:31.951
he did what he does so well.

428
00:22:32.084 --> 00:22:34.454
He made us look
at things differently.

429
00:22:34.587 --> 00:22:36.288
And thanks to you. Marmalade.

430
00:22:36.423 --> 00:22:40.026
the Love Crater Meteorite
will forever serve as a symbol

431
00:22:40.159 --> 00:22:43.796
of how there is good
even in the worst places.

432
00:22:45.532 --> 00:22:46.799
Whoo!

433
00:22:56.208 --> 00:22:58.277
Hurry up.

434
00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.081
...and successfully reversed
climate change

435
00:23:02.214 --> 00:23:04.484
for the well-being of all of us.

436
00:23:04.617 --> 00:23:08.220
This is going
surprisingly smoothly.

437
00:23:15.995 --> 00:23:18.197
What the molt is that?

438
00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:19.732
- The Wolf Piranha
Snake Shark Tarantula

439
00:23:19.866 --> 00:23:21.734
-Protection System.
-- The WPSST?

440
00:23:21.868 --> 00:23:24.236
-This was not supposed
to happen. -What?

441
00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:26.272
Guys. calm down. I'm on it.

442
00:23:26.405 --> 00:23:29.776
Initiating WPSST override
protocol.

443
00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:31.077
Get it. queen!

444
00:23:32.712 --> 00:23:34.847
-- Did it work?
-Just give me five minutes.

445
00:23:34.981 --> 00:23:38.317
And now. please join me
in welcoming to the stage...

446
00:23:38.451 --> 00:23:40.086
We don't have five minutes.

447
00:23:40.219 --> 00:23:42.321
...Professor Marmalade.

448
00:23:42.455 --> 00:23:43.389
Aw.

449
00:23:43.523 --> 00:23:45.758
We love you.
Professor Marmalade!

450
00:23:45.892 --> 00:23:47.093
The pig is on the move.

451
00:23:47.226 --> 00:23:49.361
I repeat. the pig
is on the move.

452
00:23:49.496 --> 00:23:51.864
Webs. Webs. the curtain's
going up any minute.

453
00:23:51.998 --> 00:23:53.065
It's not letting me in.

454
00:23:53.199 --> 00:23:54.366
Check your system preferences.

455
00:23:54.501 --> 00:23:55.802
You probably need
to download a driver.

456
00:23:55.935 --> 00:23:56.903
Try rebooting.

457
00:23:57.036 --> 00:23:58.404
Oh. my gosh. you fixed it.

458
00:23:58.538 --> 00:23:59.639
-SNAKE and- Really?
-No!

459
00:23:59.772 --> 00:24:01.541
-- Hey. Larry.

460
00:24:01.674 --> 00:24:02.642
Come on. open up.

461
00:24:02.775 --> 00:24:04.443
What did we say
about locking doors?

462
00:24:04.577 --> 00:24:06.913
Oh. no. no. no. no. no.
Shark. I got a situation here.

463
00:24:07.046 --> 00:24:08.247
Copy that. I'm on my way.

464
00:24:10.282 --> 00:24:11.518
Hurry up. guys.

465
00:24:11.651 --> 00:24:14.153
Time to turn this baby
on beast mode.

466
00:24:16.322 --> 00:24:18.591
Eat it. WPSST!

467
00:24:22.962 --> 00:24:24.597
Please. not now.

468
00:24:24.731 --> 00:24:26.398
-Wolf. -Wait. wait. wait.
No. no. Piranha!

469
00:24:26.533 --> 00:24:29.268
-This award is for...

470
00:24:30.302 --> 00:24:32.071
As I was saying...

471
00:24:32.204 --> 00:24:35.575
No. no. no. no. no.
no. no. no. no. no. no!

472
00:24:39.779 --> 00:24:42.448
-Piranha! Are you kidding me?
-- Sorry!

473
00:24:42.582 --> 00:24:44.684
And that's why
my Gala for Goodness

474
00:24:44.817 --> 00:24:47.587
will raise all the money needed
for those less fortunate.

475
00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:48.955
-- Come on!

476
00:24:50.857 --> 00:24:53.292
I'm starting
to get mad here. Larry.

477
00:24:54.393 --> 00:24:55.828
-- Webs! Webs!

478
00:24:55.962 --> 00:24:59.599
And now the moment
we've all been waiting for.

479
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.703
-Whoa!

480
00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.114
SHARK
Excuse me.

481
00:25:15.247 --> 00:25:16.749
Is this the ladies' room?

482
00:25:16.883 --> 00:25:18.918
Oh. uh. y-you need
to take a right

483
00:25:19.051 --> 00:25:20.920
at the end of the hall. ma'am.

484
00:25:26.192 --> 00:25:28.494
Yes. Whoop-bam!

485
00:25:29.796 --> 00:25:30.863
Oh. come on!

486
00:25:31.664 --> 00:25:35.267
And now it is my honor
to award Professor Marmalade

487
00:25:35.401 --> 00:25:39.471
with the Golden Dolphin!

488
00:25:41.173 --> 00:25:42.474
-No.
-No.

489
00:25:42.609 --> 00:25:43.743
Yes!

490
00:25:43.876 --> 00:25:46.112
I mean. yes!

491
00:25:46.245 --> 00:25:47.914
What?

492
00:25:52.952 --> 00:25:55.254
Everyone. everyone. uh.
please don't panic.

493
00:25:55.387 --> 00:25:56.689
Just stay calm.

494
00:25:56.823 --> 00:25:59.125
I'm-I'm sure there's
an explanation for this.

495
00:26:00.526 --> 00:26:03.996
I repeat. uh.
please do not panic.

496
00:26:05.598 --> 00:26:07.266
Nice work. everybody.

497
00:26:07.399 --> 00:26:10.402
Now. let's make like a wolf
and get the pack out of here.

498
00:26:10.536 --> 00:26:12.404
Ah. wordplay.

499
00:26:12.538 --> 00:26:13.706
I don't get it.

500
00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.708
Diane. Diane. if I may...

501
00:26:15.842 --> 00:26:17.910
-You have to understand.

502
00:26:18.044 --> 00:26:21.180
I didn't bring hope back
to the city for an award.

503
00:26:21.313 --> 00:26:25.217
I did these good things because
of how they made me feel.

504
00:26:25.351 --> 00:26:26.853
That tingly feeling I get.

505
00:26:26.986 --> 00:26:28.287
That shiver up my spine.

506
00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:32.191
The wag in my tiny tail.

507
00:26:32.324 --> 00:26:34.160
Because. you see.

508
00:26:34.293 --> 00:26:38.530
being good just feels so good.

509
00:26:38.665 --> 00:26:42.669
And when you're good.
you're loved.

510
00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:45.772
-Wolf?

511
00:26:45.905 --> 00:26:47.306
-Wolf?
-What are you doing?

512
00:26:47.439 --> 00:26:49.408
SNAKE. SHARK and-
Go!

513
00:26:49.541 --> 00:26:51.343
-It's the Bad Guys!

514
00:26:51.477 --> 00:26:52.645
Arrest them!

515
00:26:52.779 --> 00:26:53.545
Hut. hut. hut. hut. hut. hut.

516
00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:54.914
hut. hut. hut. hut. hut.

517
00:26:55.047 --> 00:26:56.883
hut. hut. hut. hut. hut.
hut. hut. hut. hut.

518
00:26:58.250 --> 00:26:59.551
They stole the Golden Dolphin!

519
00:26:59.686 --> 00:27:02.521
Come on. you can't prove that.

520
00:27:04.456 --> 00:27:06.325
My baby!

521
00:27:06.458 --> 00:27:07.994
-On your knees. Bad Guys.

522
00:27:08.127 --> 00:27:09.228
With your hands up.

523
00:27:09.361 --> 00:27:11.397
Never! We're out of here.

524
00:27:14.133 --> 00:27:16.368
So long. suckers.

525
00:27:22.508 --> 00:27:25.211
Well. this just got
a little weird.

526
00:27:27.346 --> 00:27:29.015
The Bad Guys go bust.

527
00:27:29.148 --> 00:27:32.151
The nefarious fivesome
has finally been captured.

528
00:27:32.284 --> 00:27:34.921
And I. Tiffany Fluffit.
am first on the scene.

529
00:27:35.054 --> 00:27:37.724
Wow. You know. I-I just
realized that I have devoted

530
00:27:37.857 --> 00:27:40.326
my entire adult life
to putting you in jail.

531
00:27:40.459 --> 00:27:42.061
You are my purpose.

532
00:27:42.194 --> 00:27:43.963
Without you. who am I?

533
00:27:44.096 --> 00:27:45.397
Ah. I'm just kidding.

534
00:27:45.531 --> 00:27:47.199
This is the best moment
of my life!

535
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.170
It's the end of the Bad Guys.

536
00:27:51.303 --> 00:27:52.604
No!

537
00:27:52.739 --> 00:27:54.640
Get your hands off of me!

538
00:27:54.774 --> 00:27:57.143
Ooh. you're begging
for a biting right now.

539
00:27:57.276 --> 00:27:58.677
Wolf!

540
00:28:01.981 --> 00:28:03.716
- Professor Marmalade!
Madam Governor!

541
00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:05.584
Ooh. Professor Marmalade!
Madam Governor!

542
00:28:05.718 --> 00:28:07.820
-Madam Governor!
-One at a time. One at a time.

543
00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:11.623
-Hey. Hey!
-Excuse me.

544
00:28:11.758 --> 00:28:13.592
-Sorry to interrupt.

545
00:28:13.726 --> 00:28:16.428
I just wanted to congratulate
the governor here.

546
00:28:16.562 --> 00:28:19.031
I got to say.
you really got us pegged.

547
00:28:19.165 --> 00:28:23.402
We're just a deep well
of anger and self-loathing.

548
00:28:23.535 --> 00:28:25.371
-Denial.
-Sure. That. too.

549
00:28:25.504 --> 00:28:26.572
-Narcissism.
-Yeah. Yeah.

550
00:28:26.705 --> 00:28:27.874
Emotional emptiness.

551
00:28:28.007 --> 00:28:29.408
-So we're on the same page.
-Hmm.

552
00:28:29.541 --> 00:28:31.510
What is he doing?

553
00:28:31.643 --> 00:28:34.680
Sadly. we were never
given a chance

554
00:28:34.814 --> 00:28:38.284
to be anything more
than second-rate criminals.

555
00:28:38.417 --> 00:28:40.887
If only there was someone
who could help

556
00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:44.556
the flower of goodness
inside us blossom.

557
00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:46.959
Some icon of love
and forgiveness.

558
00:28:47.093 --> 00:28:50.396
like. uh. I don't know.
Mother Teresa.

559
00:28:50.529 --> 00:28:53.465
Best thing is to just
throw us in jail

560
00:28:53.599 --> 00:28:56.102
for the rest
of our hopeless lives.

561
00:28:56.235 --> 00:28:57.904
Yeah. that's the plan.

562
00:28:58.037 --> 00:28:59.671
-Wait. wait. wait. no. no.

563
00:28:59.806 --> 00:29:01.373
-Get in there.
-Ow!

564
00:29:01.507 --> 00:29:03.442
Wait.

565
00:29:04.243 --> 00:29:05.477
Uh. beg... beg pardon?

566
00:29:05.611 --> 00:29:07.513
Mr. Wolf may be a savage beast.

567
00:29:07.646 --> 00:29:09.181
Basically walking garbage.

568
00:29:09.315 --> 00:29:10.649
Sorry. I'm making a point.

569
00:29:10.783 --> 00:29:12.384
Do what you need to do. pal.

570
00:29:12.518 --> 00:29:14.553
But how can we say
they're hopeless

571
00:29:14.686 --> 00:29:16.889
if they've never
been given a chance?

572
00:29:17.023 --> 00:29:19.992
What if... what if we tried
a little experiment. Diane?

573
00:29:20.126 --> 00:29:22.628
As you know.
my Gala for Goodness.

574
00:29:22.761 --> 00:29:26.465
the "hashtag charity event
of the year." is coming up.

575
00:29:26.598 --> 00:29:28.334
If I can prove
to everyone at that gala

576
00:29:28.467 --> 00:29:29.869
that the Bad Guys have changed.

577
00:29:30.002 --> 00:29:32.504
will you set them free
and give them a clean start?

578
00:29:34.073 --> 00:29:36.142
-What? Professor Marmalade!
-- Ow!

579
00:29:36.275 --> 00:29:38.510
No. no. no. no. no.
Don't you see what he's doing?

580
00:29:38.644 --> 00:29:40.146
He's playing you.

581
00:29:40.279 --> 00:29:41.347
But it was my idea.

582
00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:42.614
It was his idea.

583
00:29:42.748 --> 00:29:44.616
But only because
you made him have it.

584
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:46.953
Madam Governor.
you can't just let them go.

585
00:29:47.086 --> 00:29:49.355
Professor. I'm not about to put
the safety of the city

586
00:29:49.488 --> 00:29:51.423
on the line for an experiment.

587
00:29:51.557 --> 00:29:53.059
Excuse me. Madam Governor.

588
00:29:53.192 --> 00:29:56.795
I seem to remember that
a wise person once said.

589
00:29:56.929 --> 00:30:01.133
"Even trash can be recycled
into something beautiful."

590
00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:06.072
Okay. I'm game.

591
00:30:06.205 --> 00:30:08.740
But only because it's you.
Professor.

592
00:30:08.875 --> 00:30:09.976
No!

593
00:30:10.109 --> 00:30:12.178
We'll hold on to the Dolphin
until the gala.

594
00:30:12.311 --> 00:30:15.581
Just to remove
any unnecessary temptation.

595
00:30:15.714 --> 00:30:17.749
Of course. Good thinking.

596
00:30:17.884 --> 00:30:19.818
That's why you're governor.

597
00:30:19.952 --> 00:30:22.221
Now that everyone's happy...

598
00:30:22.354 --> 00:30:23.689
Not happy.

599
00:30:23.822 --> 00:30:26.325
...I. Rupert Marmalade
the Fourth.

600
00:30:26.458 --> 00:30:28.394
will turn the Bad Guys into...

601
00:30:28.527 --> 00:30:30.262
-the Good Guys!

602
00:30:34.867 --> 00:30:37.136
I think these belong to you.

603
00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:38.670
Hey.

604
00:30:39.771 --> 00:30:42.408
- Not everyone gets
a second chance.

605
00:30:42.541 --> 00:30:46.612
Make the most of it.
Mr. Poodleton.

606
00:30:55.121 --> 00:30:57.323
-- Wolf?

607
00:30:57.456 --> 00:30:58.624
What are you doing?

608
00:30:58.757 --> 00:31:00.192
-- What?
-- Yeah.

609
00:31:00.326 --> 00:31:02.261
Oh. that.

610
00:31:02.394 --> 00:31:05.097
I-I-I'm sorry.
I thought it was. uh. obvious.

611
00:31:05.231 --> 00:31:07.266
We're gonna go good.

612
00:31:08.467 --> 00:31:10.169
Uh. you totally lost me.

613
00:31:10.302 --> 00:31:12.404
I told him to stop drinking
out of the toilet.

614
00:31:12.538 --> 00:31:14.473
Hey. did you get hit
on the head?

615
00:31:14.606 --> 00:31:15.841
What? No. I didn't
get hit on the head.

616
00:31:15.975 --> 00:31:17.543
My cousin got hit on
the head with an anchor.

617
00:31:17.676 --> 00:31:19.311
and after that.
he only swam in a circle.

618
00:31:19.445 --> 00:31:21.513
- No. no. g-guys. guys.
you're not following me.

619
00:31:21.647 --> 00:31:24.550
We're gonna pretend to go good.

620
00:31:24.683 --> 00:31:26.218
Just a few days with Marmalade.

621
00:31:26.352 --> 00:31:30.356
And then we roll into the gala
as Good Guys

622
00:31:30.489 --> 00:31:33.692
and roll out scot-free with...

623
00:31:33.825 --> 00:31:36.628
The Golden Dolphin.

624
00:31:36.762 --> 00:31:37.896
You got it.

625
00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:40.166
Since when do we not
finish a job?

626
00:31:40.299 --> 00:31:43.569
The Bad Guys become
the Good Guys

627
00:31:43.702 --> 00:31:46.838
so we can stay the Bad Guys.

628
00:31:46.973 --> 00:31:49.408
-You know what I'm saying?

629
00:31:49.541 --> 00:31:50.943
Bad Guys acting good?

630
00:31:51.077 --> 00:31:52.778
It's the ultimate Bad Guy thing.

631
00:31:52.911 --> 00:31:54.213
It's fantastic.

632
00:31:54.346 --> 00:31:55.647
Wolf. you're a genius.

633
00:31:57.349 --> 00:31:59.685
It's gonna be. like.
the most relaxing con ever.

634
00:31:59.818 --> 00:32:01.287
like a vacation.

635
00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:03.655
Oh. oh. A con-cation.

636
00:32:05.557 --> 00:32:09.228
- Ooh! My parents met
on a con-cation.

637
00:32:23.309 --> 00:32:24.476
Oh. goody.

638
00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:26.045
WOLF
Wow.

639
00:32:26.178 --> 00:32:27.646
Big and fancy.

640
00:32:27.779 --> 00:32:29.948
Rodent's got taste. Okay.

641
00:32:30.082 --> 00:32:32.851
Huh. Almost makes me
want to be cute.

642
00:32:32.985 --> 00:32:36.355
- They say experience
is the best teacher.

643
00:32:36.488 --> 00:32:38.190
And they are wrong.

644
00:32:38.324 --> 00:32:39.558
I am.

645
00:32:39.691 --> 00:32:41.893
Good morning.
students of goodness.

646
00:32:42.028 --> 00:32:47.166
And welcome to the first day
of the rest of your best life.

647
00:32:47.299 --> 00:32:48.500
A giant butt.

648
00:32:48.634 --> 00:32:49.835
Huh?

649
00:32:49.968 --> 00:32:51.470
Uh. it's-it's not a butt.

650
00:32:51.603 --> 00:32:54.106
It's a lamp in the shape of

651
00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.375
the Love Crater Meteorite.
my greatest...

652
00:32:56.508 --> 00:32:58.444
-I wonder whose butt it is.
--- Uh...

653
00:32:59.245 --> 00:33:01.247
Once again. it's not a butt.
Thank you.

654
00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:03.249
It's a heart.
Now. as I was saying...

655
00:33:03.382 --> 00:33:05.651
-Then why does it have cheeks?
--Shut it!

656
00:33:05.784 --> 00:33:07.519
What? I've never seen
a heart with cheeks.

657
00:33:07.653 --> 00:33:09.121
It's not a...

658
00:33:09.255 --> 00:33:11.623
-Booty!
-It's not a butt! Not a butt!

659
00:33:11.757 --> 00:33:14.193
Does he know what a butt is?

660
00:33:14.326 --> 00:33:16.062
As I was saying.

661
00:33:16.195 --> 00:33:19.031
on the outside.
the five of you are villains.

662
00:33:19.165 --> 00:33:21.133
predators.
remorseless sociopaths.

663
00:33:21.267 --> 00:33:23.335
Oh. stop.
You're making me blush.

664
00:33:23.469 --> 00:33:25.204
But inside. there's a flower--

665
00:33:25.337 --> 00:33:28.174
the flower of goodness--
and when it blooms

666
00:33:28.307 --> 00:33:30.709
and you feel that tingle
of positivity

667
00:33:30.842 --> 00:33:32.344
radiating through your body.

668
00:33:32.478 --> 00:33:35.547
you're going to want to feel it
all the time.

669
00:33:35.681 --> 00:33:37.349
So we're going for a tingle?

670
00:33:37.483 --> 00:33:38.684
Not any tingle.

671
00:33:38.817 --> 00:33:40.919
The tingle of goodness.
which you'll feel

672
00:33:41.053 --> 00:33:44.290
in my state-of-the-art
Sharing Laboratory.

673
00:33:44.423 --> 00:33:48.327
Okay. Mr. Snake. I'm going
to give you a Push Pop.

674
00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:50.896
Great! Push Pop just for me!

675
00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:53.632
-No. to share.
-Why?

676
00:33:53.765 --> 00:33:55.634
Well. on a fundamental level.

677
00:33:55.767 --> 00:33:57.736
it's about putting
someone else's needs

678
00:33:57.869 --> 00:34:00.206
-ahead of your own.

679
00:34:00.339 --> 00:34:02.074
Oh. no. No way.

680
00:34:02.208 --> 00:34:03.942
Snake.

681
00:34:04.076 --> 00:34:06.678
All right. all right.

682
00:34:06.812 --> 00:34:08.680
This is going to taste
extra sweet.

683
00:34:08.814 --> 00:34:11.317
'cause I know how bad
you want it.

684
00:34:13.885 --> 00:34:15.721
Pop me. please. Ah...

685
00:34:19.625 --> 00:34:21.460
Nope. Sucker.

686
00:34:21.593 --> 00:34:22.694
-That's it!

687
00:34:22.828 --> 00:34:24.596
-I'll teach you to share!

688
00:34:26.031 --> 00:34:28.033
Mm. I like sharing.
It's yummy. Mm.

689
00:34:28.167 --> 00:34:29.868
SNAKE
Totally worth it.

690
00:34:30.001 --> 00:34:32.104
Well. that's terrifying.

691
00:34:32.238 --> 00:34:34.173
Let's try something simpler.

692
00:34:34.306 --> 00:34:36.708
A good person always
pays attention

693
00:34:36.842 --> 00:34:38.177
to the needs of others.

694
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:40.846
Now. here's a kindly.
frail grandma.

695
00:34:42.981 --> 00:34:46.318
Mr. Piranha. help grandma
across the street.

696
00:34:46.452 --> 00:34:49.221
Sure. sure. sure.
I do this all the time.

697
00:34:50.021 --> 00:34:52.824
-Here you go. ma'am.

698
00:34:52.958 --> 00:34:54.793
Oh. he is totally gonna blow it.

699
00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:56.328
What was that? What did you say

700
00:34:56.462 --> 00:34:57.929
-You think I can't do this?

701
00:34:58.063 --> 00:35:00.366
-No. no. no. Piranha!

702
00:35:03.435 --> 00:35:05.304
Maybe simpler?

703
00:35:07.506 --> 00:35:10.276
Hey. look.
It's a cat stuck in a tree.

704
00:35:10.409 --> 00:35:12.411
It doesn't get much simpler
than that.

705
00:35:12.544 --> 00:35:14.446
Now. what in this scenario

706
00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:16.482
would give you that good tingle?

707
00:35:16.615 --> 00:35:18.083
Eating it?

708
00:35:18.217 --> 00:35:20.352
This is why I always carry
two pieces of bread with me.

709
00:35:20.486 --> 00:35:21.520
No.

710
00:35:21.653 --> 00:35:24.390
I want you to s...

711
00:35:24.523 --> 00:35:25.657
-Smack it.
-Skin it?

712
00:35:25.791 --> 00:35:27.426
-Stab it.
-Sauté it. -Sing to it?

713
00:35:27.559 --> 00:35:29.328
Save it. I want you to sa...

714
00:35:29.461 --> 00:35:31.597
That's obv... It's so obvi...
I want you to save it.

715
00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:32.998
Oh!

716
00:35:33.131 --> 00:35:34.900
-Right. right.
-Right. right. right. Sure.

717
00:35:35.901 --> 00:35:38.470
-Here. kitty. kitty. kitty.

718
00:35:39.871 --> 00:35:41.540
Whoa. that cat is
obviously defective.

719
00:35:41.673 --> 00:35:42.841
What is wrong with you?

720
00:35:42.974 --> 00:35:44.510
You're gonna give it
a heart attack.

721
00:35:44.643 --> 00:35:46.312
I'll handle this.

722
00:35:47.145 --> 00:35:49.415
-What's up. papa!

723
00:35:51.049 --> 00:35:53.352
Get him off my face!
He's on my face!

724
00:35:53.485 --> 00:35:55.654
No. no. no. no. no. listen!
Wh-What are you doing?

725
00:36:00.459 --> 00:36:03.995
Okay. What. may I ask.
are you good at?

726
00:36:04.129 --> 00:36:05.631
Stealing stuff.

727
00:36:05.764 --> 00:36:06.832
Oh. yeah. we're great at that.

728
00:36:06.965 --> 00:36:07.933
-Robbery.
-Larceny.

729
00:36:08.066 --> 00:36:09.134
-Wire fraud.
-Extortion.

730
00:36:09.268 --> 00:36:10.636
-Tax evasion.
-Heists.

731
00:36:10.769 --> 00:36:12.504
-- Mail fraud.
-Wait. Heists. you say?

732
00:36:12.638 --> 00:36:14.973
Well. that's... yeah.
that's kind of our specialty.

733
00:36:15.106 --> 00:36:17.576
I might just have an idea.

734
00:36:17.709 --> 00:36:20.946
Free the pigs! Free the pigs!

735
00:36:21.079 --> 00:36:23.782
That is an animal testing lab.

736
00:36:23.915 --> 00:36:26.352
Within. 200.000 helpless
guinea pigs.

737
00:36:26.485 --> 00:36:30.489
all being poked and prodded
by sadistic scientists.

738
00:36:30.622 --> 00:36:31.890
Guinea pigs. you say?

739
00:36:32.023 --> 00:36:33.492
Snake.

740
00:36:33.625 --> 00:36:34.893
I want you to rescue them.

741
00:36:35.026 --> 00:36:37.028
But this is a heist for good.

742
00:36:37.162 --> 00:36:40.532
so I brought something
more friendly for you to wear.

743
00:36:40.666 --> 00:36:42.834
-Bye.

744
00:36:42.968 --> 00:36:44.736
Well. there goes
our street cred.

745
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:46.538
At least it's comfy.

746
00:36:48.173 --> 00:36:51.009
- All right. we need
to distract that scientist.

747
00:36:51.142 --> 00:36:53.111
-Shark. you're up.
-Copy that.

748
00:36:53.245 --> 00:36:55.347
Okay. We're gonna need
a rope and a hook.

749
00:36:55.481 --> 00:36:57.048
-I got this one.
-- What?

750
00:36:57.182 --> 00:36:58.317
You're volunteering?

751
00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:00.018
You've never volunteered
for anything.

752
00:37:00.151 --> 00:37:01.820
Sure. I did. Right now.

753
00:37:01.953 --> 00:37:04.089
-Uh...
-Throw me up there. Giddyap!

754
00:37:04.222 --> 00:37:05.591
-Really?
-Yep.

755
00:37:05.724 --> 00:37:07.259
I'm 99% sure you can make it.

756
00:37:07.393 --> 00:37:09.160
-Okay.
-Let's do it!

757
00:37:10.061 --> 00:37:11.563
Hey there. son.

758
00:37:11.697 --> 00:37:12.764
Dad?

759
00:37:12.898 --> 00:37:14.466
I know you've got
an important job.

760
00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:17.002
but I hope you still have time
for a catch with your old man.

761
00:37:18.637 --> 00:37:20.272
-Hey. kiddo. -Huh?
-- 96% sure.

762
00:37:20.406 --> 00:37:22.073
You'll always be my special boy.

763
00:37:22.207 --> 00:37:23.609
-Aw.

764
00:37:23.742 --> 00:37:25.176
Maybe 90%.

765
00:37:25.311 --> 00:37:27.646
I've been waiting
my entire life for this moment.

766
00:37:27.779 --> 00:37:29.948
-SNAKE I don't know.
-Okay. Now. go long.

767
00:37:30.081 --> 00:37:31.650
Oh. boy. oh. boy. oh. boy!

768
00:37:31.783 --> 00:37:34.786
Thank you. Daddy!

769
00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.323
50... What day is it?

770
00:37:37.456 --> 00:37:38.590
Who am I?

771
00:37:38.724 --> 00:37:40.326
- Right.
The guinea pigs are locked

772
00:37:40.459 --> 00:37:42.328
behind a three-foot-thick
steel door.

773
00:37:42.461 --> 00:37:44.530
The only way in
is through the vents.

774
00:37:44.663 --> 00:37:46.231
I got it.

775
00:37:48.367 --> 00:37:50.068
I have never seen him
so chipper.

776
00:37:50.201 --> 00:37:51.903
Has he been meditating?

777
00:38:00.579 --> 00:38:01.980
Oh.

778
00:38:02.113 --> 00:38:04.483
Snake attack.

779
00:38:05.283 --> 00:38:07.152
Oh. Hey. look.
it's Professor Marmalade.

780
00:38:07.285 --> 00:38:09.588
Yes. that's right. It's me.

781
00:38:09.721 --> 00:38:11.056
Help has arrived.

782
00:38:11.189 --> 00:38:13.392
Just keep your eyes glued
to that door.

783
00:38:13.525 --> 00:38:16.495
Snake. Come on. Snake. Open up.

784
00:38:16.628 --> 00:38:17.829
Relax.

785
00:38:17.963 --> 00:38:20.098
These doors are complicated.

786
00:38:20.231 --> 00:38:22.000
-- Are you kidding me?

787
00:38:22.133 --> 00:38:23.402
What do you think you're doing?

788
00:38:23.535 --> 00:38:25.236
We're supposed to save them.
not eat them.

789
00:38:25.371 --> 00:38:27.873
Well. I'd say they've gone
to a better place.

790
00:38:29.274 --> 00:38:30.342
All right. that's it.

791
00:38:30.476 --> 00:38:31.977
-Spit them out.
-Hey.

792
00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:33.679
Hey!

793
00:38:33.812 --> 00:38:35.347
We gonna save you
whether you like it or not.

794
00:38:35.481 --> 00:38:37.015
We're saving you.
you stupid hair balls.

795
00:38:37.148 --> 00:38:39.385
Not that door. The other door.

796
00:38:40.251 --> 00:38:41.353
Hey. hey.

797
00:38:41.487 --> 00:38:42.354
Whoa!

798
00:38:42.488 --> 00:38:43.622
Any second.

799
00:38:53.965 --> 00:38:55.834
It-it's not what it looks like.

800
00:39:03.074 --> 00:39:05.677
Trespassing. burglary. mayhem.

801
00:39:05.811 --> 00:39:07.946
assault with a deadly reptile?

802
00:39:08.079 --> 00:39:09.581
As if those poor rodents

803
00:39:09.715 --> 00:39:11.583
haven't been through
enough already.

804
00:39:11.717 --> 00:39:12.851
No. Diane. please.

805
00:39:12.984 --> 00:39:14.553
Okay.

806
00:39:14.686 --> 00:39:17.523
I'm sorry. Professor.
but I'm calling the chief.

807
00:39:17.656 --> 00:39:18.490
Please. Come on.

808
00:39:18.624 --> 00:39:19.891
This experiment is over.

809
00:39:20.025 --> 00:39:20.926
Experiments take time.

810
00:39:21.059 --> 00:39:22.260
You couldn't help yourself?

811
00:39:22.394 --> 00:39:23.695
So I had a moment of weakness.
Sue me.

812
00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:25.531
That's gonna be difficult to do
from prison.

813
00:39:25.664 --> 00:39:27.799
Guys. what do we do now?

814
00:39:29.501 --> 00:39:33.104
Hmm. Time to launch
a charm offensive.

815
00:39:33.238 --> 00:39:36.742
Oh. yeah. The full Clooney.

816
00:39:36.875 --> 00:39:38.677
Madam Governor.

817
00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:39.778
Diane.

818
00:39:39.911 --> 00:39:41.413
Do not Clooney me. Wolf.

819
00:39:41.547 --> 00:39:43.749
Oh. I see what's going on.
You think I'm still a Bad Guy.

820
00:39:43.882 --> 00:39:46.117
trying to bamboozle
my way to freedom.

821
00:39:46.251 --> 00:39:47.753
But we've changed.

822
00:39:47.886 --> 00:39:50.221
That flower of goodness is
blossoming all over the place.

823
00:39:50.355 --> 00:39:53.058
Don't you ever
get tired of lying?

824
00:39:53.191 --> 00:39:54.726
No.

825
00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:56.094
I mean... Fudge.

826
00:39:56.227 --> 00:39:57.729
That was... that was
a trick question. right?

827
00:39:57.863 --> 00:40:00.766
I gave you an opportunity--

828
00:40:00.899 --> 00:40:02.300
a chance to show the world

829
00:40:02.434 --> 00:40:04.603
that you're more than just
a scary stereotype--

830
00:40:04.736 --> 00:40:06.538
but you're too proud

831
00:40:06.672 --> 00:40:09.140
or too gutless
to take advantage of it.

832
00:40:09.274 --> 00:40:11.042
Gutless? I'm gutless?

833
00:40:11.176 --> 00:40:12.277
Oh.

834
00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:13.812
I'm sorry. have we met?

835
00:40:13.945 --> 00:40:15.280
I'm the villain of every story.

836
00:40:15.413 --> 00:40:16.648
Guilty until proven innocent.

837
00:40:16.782 --> 00:40:19.885
Even if by some miracle
we did change.

838
00:40:20.018 --> 00:40:21.720
who's gonna believe us. huh?

839
00:40:21.853 --> 00:40:23.655
Of course you wouldn't know
anything about that.

840
00:40:23.789 --> 00:40:27.659
with your Little Miss Perfect
power suits.

841
00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:29.861
Is that so?

842
00:40:29.995 --> 00:40:31.463
Wait a second.

843
00:40:31.597 --> 00:40:33.264
What did... How did you...

844
00:40:33.398 --> 00:40:37.636
A wolf and a fox
are not so different.

845
00:40:38.436 --> 00:40:40.772
Maybe they will believe you.
maybe they won't.

846
00:40:40.906 --> 00:40:42.273
but it doesn't matter.

847
00:40:42.407 --> 00:40:44.710
Don't do it for them.
Do it for you.

848
00:40:44.843 --> 00:40:47.345
This is a chance
to write your own story.

849
00:40:47.479 --> 00:40:50.448
To find a better life for you
and your friends.

850
00:40:51.249 --> 00:40:53.018
Come on.
what have you got to lose?

851
00:40:53.151 --> 00:40:55.120
I don't know. My dignity?

852
00:40:56.287 --> 00:40:59.691
Yeah. well.
that ship has already sailed.

853
00:41:05.664 --> 00:41:08.466
Believe it or not.
I'm rooting for you. Wolf.

854
00:41:09.267 --> 00:41:11.436
So you're not gonna
call the chief?

855
00:41:12.237 --> 00:41:15.140
-I'll see you at the gala.

856
00:41:49.908 --> 00:41:52.277
I think we got off
to a bad start.

857
00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:54.412
The name's Wolf.

858
00:41:57.082 --> 00:41:58.784
Yep.

859
00:41:58.917 --> 00:42:00.251
I get that a lot.

860
00:42:00.385 --> 00:42:02.621
First impressions and all.

861
00:42:06.257 --> 00:42:07.893
No. no. no. no.

862
00:42:14.365 --> 00:42:16.034
Uh. it's okay. It's okay.

863
00:42:16.167 --> 00:42:18.103
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I know you're scared.

864
00:42:18.236 --> 00:42:20.338
I would be. too. if I were you.

865
00:42:21.272 --> 00:42:22.841
Just give me a chance.

866
00:42:24.242 --> 00:42:27.212
Truth is we actually have
a lot in common.

867
00:42:27.345 --> 00:42:29.214
Don't tell anyone.

868
00:42:29.347 --> 00:42:32.083
but I love a little scratch

869
00:42:32.217 --> 00:42:34.385
on the spot behind my ears.

870
00:42:34.519 --> 00:42:36.221
You know. right there.

871
00:42:36.354 --> 00:42:38.423
The best.

872
00:42:43.028 --> 00:42:45.797
Come on. kitty.

873
00:43:03.682 --> 00:43:06.017
-Yeah. Who's a good kitty?

874
00:43:06.151 --> 00:43:08.053
-Who's a good kitty?
-- Uh. Wolf?

875
00:43:08.186 --> 00:43:10.989
Um. you saved him?

876
00:43:11.122 --> 00:43:12.390
Yes!

877
00:43:12.523 --> 00:43:15.460
Yes. It's working.

878
00:43:15.593 --> 00:43:16.828
You-you filmed that?

879
00:43:16.962 --> 00:43:19.397
Yes. and they're starting
to like you.

880
00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:20.565
SHARK
Yeah!

881
00:43:20.699 --> 00:43:22.433
-All right!

882
00:43:22.567 --> 00:43:23.702
This might just be enough

883
00:43:23.835 --> 00:43:25.170
to win over the guests
at the gala.

884
00:43:25.303 --> 00:43:27.272
-Now we're talking!
-Yes! -All right!

885
00:43:27.405 --> 00:43:30.008
Yeah. we did it! All right!

886
00:43:30.141 --> 00:43:31.777
Uh. Wolf?

887
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:34.312
I must say.
you've really turned a corner.

888
00:43:34.445 --> 00:43:36.314
-You're really getting it.
-Really?

889
00:43:36.447 --> 00:43:38.016
-Oh. uh. thanks.

890
00:43:38.149 --> 00:43:39.184
Now. I mean it.

891
00:43:39.317 --> 00:43:41.252
And I can see it
from tip to tail.

892
00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:45.556
It's just a shame that you
have to carry all that baggage.

893
00:43:46.424 --> 00:43:48.927
What are you talk...
You mean the guys?

894
00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:50.328
What do you mean?

895
00:43:50.461 --> 00:43:51.830
You have great potential. Wolf.

896
00:43:51.963 --> 00:43:53.431
but at some point.
you're going to have to choose

897
00:43:53.564 --> 00:43:56.702
between your friends
or the good life.

898
00:44:05.576 --> 00:44:07.746
Hey. You still awake?

899
00:44:09.547 --> 00:44:11.116
You-you brought the cat in?

900
00:44:11.249 --> 00:44:12.951
Yeah. Yeah. yeah.

901
00:44:13.084 --> 00:44:15.020
I'm just...
I'm just saving it up for later.

902
00:44:15.153 --> 00:44:16.554
Why? What's up?

903
00:44:17.388 --> 00:44:19.024
I was just getting
a little worried.

904
00:44:19.157 --> 00:44:20.826
since you've kind of become a...

905
00:44:20.959 --> 00:44:22.928
-Become a what?

906
00:44:23.061 --> 00:44:25.096
You know. teacher's pet.

907
00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:27.432
Getting all cozy with Marmalade.

908
00:44:27.565 --> 00:44:29.534
Your tail wagging
and everything.

909
00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:31.636
Well. yeah. because
it has to be believable.

910
00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:34.505
Uh-huh. Yeah. I guess so.

911
00:44:34.639 --> 00:44:37.242
As long as it's all
part of the plan.

912
00:44:38.109 --> 00:44:40.678
It is all part of the plan.
isn't it?

913
00:44:40.812 --> 00:44:43.949
Snake. buddy.
who made the plan to begin with?

914
00:44:44.082 --> 00:44:45.483
You did.

915
00:44:45.616 --> 00:44:49.087
So I'm the one who sticks
to the plan the most. right?

916
00:44:50.722 --> 00:44:52.290
Yeah. ri... Uh. yeah. ok...

917
00:44:52.423 --> 00:44:54.659
I guess that makes sense. yeah.

918
00:44:54.793 --> 00:44:57.195
But if the plan
were ever to change.

919
00:44:57.328 --> 00:45:00.031
you'd-you'd tell me. right?

920
00:45:02.533 --> 00:45:04.669
You have my word.

921
00:45:04.803 --> 00:45:06.838
Go bad...

922
00:45:07.638 --> 00:45:09.540
Or go home.

923
00:45:17.382 --> 00:45:19.550
-Hey. Snake. -Yeah?

924
00:45:19.684 --> 00:45:21.887
You ever wonder
what it'd be like?

925
00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:24.689
The world loving us
instead of being scared of us?

926
00:45:24.823 --> 00:45:26.724
You ever...
you ever think about that?

927
00:45:26.858 --> 00:45:27.993
Loving us?

928
00:45:28.126 --> 00:45:29.527
Yeah. right.

929
00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:31.596
I don't waste time
thinking about stuff

930
00:45:31.729 --> 00:45:33.264
that's never gonna happen.

931
00:45:33.398 --> 00:45:37.803
I can't wait for things
to get back to normal.

932
00:45:44.843 --> 00:45:47.445
Yeah. Back to normal.
back to normal.

933
00:45:55.954 --> 00:45:58.456
What up?
We are just moments away

934
00:45:58.589 --> 00:46:00.491
from Professor Marmalade's
Gala for Goodness.

935
00:46:00.625 --> 00:46:02.660
where the legendary
Love Crater Meteorite

936
00:46:02.794 --> 00:46:05.797
will be on display
for the first time ever.

937
00:46:05.931 --> 00:46:08.566
But what everyone
is really buzzing about

938
00:46:08.699 --> 00:46:12.037
is the Bad Guys. whose
heart-melting rescue video

939
00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:16.007
has made them an overnight
viral sensation.

940
00:46:17.442 --> 00:46:19.477
All right. guys.
this is the big one.

941
00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:21.212
The Golden Dolphin

942
00:46:21.346 --> 00:46:22.814
is inside a titanium case

943
00:46:22.948 --> 00:46:24.782
controlled by a randomly
generated five-digit code.

944
00:46:24.916 --> 00:46:26.451
a code kept safe and secure

945
00:46:26.584 --> 00:46:29.487
inside a briefcase handcuffed
to the chief of police.

946
00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:31.489
She's not messing around.

947
00:46:31.622 --> 00:46:33.191
- The code is only
accessible with

948
00:46:33.324 --> 00:46:34.926
-her authorized fingerprints.
-- Leave that to me.

949
00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:36.995
While Snake gets the code.

950
00:46:37.128 --> 00:46:38.496
Shark will secure
the fake Dolphin.

951
00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:40.231
I like the sound of that.

952
00:46:40.365 --> 00:46:42.100
- Meanwhile. the rest of us
plant circuit jammers.

953
00:46:42.233 --> 00:46:44.202
- Allowing me
to hack into the power grid.

954
00:46:44.335 --> 00:46:45.904
- At the end of the night.
we toast the professor.

955
00:46:46.037 --> 00:46:47.939
"Blah-blah-blah. yada yada."

956
00:46:48.073 --> 00:46:50.475
and when I say "Marmalade."
lights go out.

957
00:46:50.608 --> 00:46:53.411
and we'll have exactly
four seconds to make our move.

958
00:46:53.544 --> 00:46:55.446
The old switcheroo.

959
00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:58.249
- Chief hands Marmalade
the fake Dolphin.

960
00:46:58.383 --> 00:47:01.352
we get our pardon. applause.
applause. exit stage right.

961
00:47:01.486 --> 00:47:03.955
and by the time they realize
what happened...

962
00:47:04.089 --> 00:47:05.656
So long. suckers!

963
00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:07.425
...we'll be driving off
into the sunset.

964
00:47:07.558 --> 00:47:08.726
legacy cemented.

965
00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:10.195
-- Nice.

966
00:47:10.328 --> 00:47:11.596
Got to hand it to you. buddy.

967
00:47:11.729 --> 00:47:13.664
You're a real artist.

968
00:47:16.267 --> 00:47:18.203
Well. Good Guys. this is it.

969
00:47:18.336 --> 00:47:19.737
Good luck out there.

970
00:47:19.871 --> 00:47:23.708
Remember. all eyes will be
on you tonight. not me.

971
00:47:23.841 --> 00:47:27.712
Friends. meet the Good Guys!

972
00:47:33.418 --> 00:47:35.420
Uh. this is different.

973
00:47:35.553 --> 00:47:37.522
-Is this a prank?
-What's that sound?

974
00:47:37.655 --> 00:47:39.724
Like screaming
but not terrified.

975
00:47:39.857 --> 00:47:42.693
All right. guys.
let's. uh... let's mingle.

976
00:47:42.827 --> 00:47:44.996
It's crime time. baby.

977
00:47:49.634 --> 00:47:51.036
-Hmm?
-- There you go.

978
00:47:57.242 --> 00:47:59.310
Okay. fake Dolphin.
fake Dolphin. fake Dolphin.

979
00:47:59.444 --> 00:48:00.645
Bingo.

980
00:48:00.778 --> 00:48:02.780
-Mr. Shark. Mr. Shark!
-Ooh!

981
00:48:02.914 --> 00:48:05.183
Is it true sharks
can smell blood a mile away?

982
00:48:05.316 --> 00:48:07.452
What? No. That's freaky.

983
00:48:13.091 --> 00:48:14.825
-Oh. Mr. Wolf! Mr. Wolf!
-Hey. Whoa.

984
00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:16.294
It is a pleasure to meet you.

985
00:48:16.427 --> 00:48:18.229
-Pleasure is all mine.
-I loved your video.

986
00:48:18.363 --> 00:48:20.165
Can I get a picture for my kids?

987
00:48:20.298 --> 00:48:22.700
Uh. hey. just a minute. guys.
Let me... let me. uh...

988
00:48:22.833 --> 00:48:25.136
I got... I'll be right back.

989
00:48:27.572 --> 00:48:31.676
Okay. Wolf. what are you up to?

990
00:48:32.643 --> 00:48:34.679
Yeah. with criminals like this.

991
00:48:34.812 --> 00:48:38.149
you got to be crafty.
subtle. invisible.

992
00:48:38.283 --> 00:48:41.619
And then the moment
they let their guard down...

993
00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:43.721
-whammo!

994
00:48:43.854 --> 00:48:45.056
You gotta spring the trap!

995
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:47.625
Always one step ahead.

996
00:48:47.758 --> 00:48:50.261
I think I've earned
a tonic water.

997
00:48:50.395 --> 00:48:52.563
Put it in a fun glass. huh?

998
00:48:52.697 --> 00:48:54.499
Oh! Nice.

999
00:48:56.501 --> 00:48:58.103
-Oh. no.

1000
00:48:58.236 --> 00:49:00.005
Hey.

1001
00:49:04.609 --> 00:49:06.477
-Hey.

1002
00:49:06.611 --> 00:49:08.113
That's right.

1003
00:49:08.246 --> 00:49:10.281
-Be intimidated.

1004
00:49:11.416 --> 00:49:12.984
Mm.

1005
00:49:14.652 --> 00:49:15.987
No. no. no. no. no. no. no. no!

1006
00:49:23.428 --> 00:49:24.495
-What?
-Hmm?

1007
00:50:11.342 --> 00:50:12.343
Mr. Wolf.

1008
00:50:12.477 --> 00:50:14.145
Diane. Yeah. what a surprise.

1009
00:50:14.279 --> 00:50:15.746
You know.
if I didn't know better.

1010
00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:17.282
I'd think that
you were avoiding me.

1011
00:50:17.415 --> 00:50:18.616
Avoiding you?

1012
00:50:18.749 --> 00:50:20.418
Wh-Why would I do that?

1013
00:50:21.419 --> 00:50:22.787
Okay.

1014
00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:26.457
But I have to say.
I'm a little disappointed.

1015
00:50:27.258 --> 00:50:30.228
I was hoping you were gonna
ask me to dance.

1016
00:50:30.361 --> 00:50:31.562
Oh.

1017
00:50:52.483 --> 00:50:55.286
I see.
You lost the sheep's clothing.

1018
00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:58.323
Yeah. Figured it was time I got
comfortable in my own fur.

1019
00:50:58.456 --> 00:51:00.091
- If you're
feeling good in here...

1020
00:51:00.225 --> 00:51:02.560
I said. if you're feeling
good in here...

1021
00:51:05.596 --> 00:51:06.997
I think I like the new you.

1022
00:51:07.132 --> 00:51:08.566
Well. that makes two of us.

1023
00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:39.029
Break out the umbrellas.
because it's raining money.

1024
00:51:39.164 --> 00:51:41.599
All because of-- I can't even
believe I'm saying this--

1025
00:51:41.732 --> 00:51:44.335
all because of the Bad Guys.

1026
00:51:59.717 --> 00:52:01.452
So. how does it feel

1027
00:52:01.586 --> 00:52:04.289
to have everyone
not fear you for a change?

1028
00:52:12.029 --> 00:52:14.499
It feels good.

1029
00:52:14.632 --> 00:52:16.100
Real good.

1030
00:52:16.234 --> 00:52:17.835
Diane...

1031
00:52:21.472 --> 00:52:23.308
It belongs to you.

1032
00:52:51.769 --> 00:52:53.438
Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Wolf.

1033
00:52:53.571 --> 00:52:55.139
As you know.
the money raised tonight

1034
00:52:55.273 --> 00:52:58.276
will be delivered tomorrow
to schools. hospitals

1035
00:52:58.409 --> 00:53:00.445
and other worthy causes
across the city.

1036
00:53:01.812 --> 00:53:03.981
Uh...

1037
00:53:04.114 --> 00:53:07.151
I just want to take
a moment to recognize

1038
00:53:07.285 --> 00:53:09.420
the one responsible
for our new outlook.

1039
00:53:09.554 --> 00:53:12.056
Our brilliant mentor.

1040
00:53:12.189 --> 00:53:13.791
-a paragon of enlightenment...
-Do it. -Come on.

1041
00:53:13.924 --> 00:53:16.927
...the one and only
Professor...

1042
00:53:19.564 --> 00:53:21.732
-- Wolf. do it.
-- ...uh. Professor...

1043
00:53:23.268 --> 00:53:25.470
...um...

1044
00:53:27.305 --> 00:53:29.440
...Professor Marmalade!

1045
00:53:32.109 --> 00:53:34.379
Chief. may I do the honors?

1046
00:53:37.548 --> 00:53:38.683
That's not the plan.

1047
00:53:38.816 --> 00:53:39.850
What is happening?

1048
00:53:39.984 --> 00:53:41.386
He's gone rogue.

1049
00:53:42.853 --> 00:53:44.689
A deal's a deal.

1050
00:53:45.723 --> 00:53:48.559
By the power vested in me.
it is a pleasure

1051
00:53:48.693 --> 00:53:51.195
to grant the Bad Guys
a full par...

1052
00:53:55.232 --> 00:53:57.802
-That was weird.
-- The meteorite is gone!

1053
00:53:57.935 --> 00:53:59.304
Somebody stole it!

1054
00:54:01.872 --> 00:54:03.274
-Chief.

1055
00:54:03.408 --> 00:54:05.276
-Wolf.
-Come on.

1056
00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:07.044
You can't possibly think
that we did this.

1057
00:54:07.177 --> 00:54:09.380
So long. suckers!

1058
00:54:10.481 --> 00:54:11.882
Run!

1059
00:54:12.016 --> 00:54:13.351
Get them!

1060
00:54:20.758 --> 00:54:23.093
Uh...

1061
00:54:26.797 --> 00:54:28.466
Here. Here.

1062
00:54:28.599 --> 00:54:31.168
-What are you doing?
-I'm giving it all back.

1063
00:54:31.302 --> 00:54:32.403
Huh?

1064
00:54:32.537 --> 00:54:34.605
-Excuse me.

1065
00:54:37.642 --> 00:54:40.144
-What happened back there?
-I couldn't do it.

1066
00:54:40.277 --> 00:54:42.012
What do you mean.
you couldn't do it?

1067
00:54:42.146 --> 00:54:43.414
-I-I-I just... I...
-No!

1068
00:54:43.548 --> 00:54:45.850
-I do not run.
-- Hut. hut. hut...

1069
00:54:45.983 --> 00:54:47.652
That is not how I roll.

1070
00:54:47.785 --> 00:54:49.587
Piranha.
don't do anything crazy.

1071
00:54:51.188 --> 00:54:54.492
Crazy is what I bring
to the party. chico.

1072
00:55:02.367 --> 00:55:03.734
Hey. you're making a mistake.

1073
00:55:03.868 --> 00:55:04.835
We didn't do it.

1074
00:55:04.969 --> 00:55:06.103
I know we always say that.

1075
00:55:06.236 --> 00:55:07.304
but this time
it's actually true.

1076
00:55:07.438 --> 00:55:09.306
A-la-la-la-la. Can't hear you.

1077
00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:11.542
-Guilty. guilty. guilty.
-Talk to Marmalade.

1078
00:55:11.676 --> 00:55:13.478
We're really good now.
He'll tell you.

1079
00:55:13.611 --> 00:55:14.712
Professor!

1080
00:55:14.845 --> 00:55:17.114
Tonight's headline:
Change is impossible.

1081
00:55:17.247 --> 00:55:19.116
You should always judge
a book by its cover.

1082
00:55:19.249 --> 00:55:21.486
and all stereotypes
have been affirmed.

1083
00:55:21.619 --> 00:55:23.220
Stop. for goodness' sake!

1084
00:55:23.354 --> 00:55:24.655
Let me speak to them.

1085
00:55:24.789 --> 00:55:27.324
I'm-I'm sure there's been
some misunderstanding.

1086
00:55:28.125 --> 00:55:30.260
-Ah. Professor Marmalade.

1087
00:55:30.395 --> 00:55:31.762
You've got five minutes.

1088
00:55:31.896 --> 00:55:33.898
No deals this time.

1089
00:55:34.031 --> 00:55:35.065
Y-You have to help us.

1090
00:55:35.199 --> 00:55:36.734
Tell 'em.
Tell 'em we didn't do it.

1091
00:55:36.867 --> 00:55:38.736
There. there.
Of course you didn't do it.

1092
00:55:38.869 --> 00:55:40.004
How could you?

1093
00:55:40.137 --> 00:55:43.508
After all.
you're such a good boy.

1094
00:55:44.308 --> 00:55:47.678
You're such a good boy.

1095
00:55:47.812 --> 00:55:49.514
That shiver up my spine.

1096
00:55:49.647 --> 00:55:51.882
The wag in my tiny tail.

1097
00:55:52.016 --> 00:55:53.250
Arrest them!

1098
00:55:53.384 --> 00:55:55.152
What if we tried
a little experiment. Diane?

1099
00:55:55.285 --> 00:55:57.588
As you know.
my Gala for Goodness...

1100
00:55:57.722 --> 00:55:59.957
- Where the legendary
Love Crater Meteorite

1101
00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:02.627
will be on display
for the first time ever.

1102
00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:06.063
All eyes will be
on you tonight. not me.

1103
00:56:06.897 --> 00:56:08.132
You're such a...

1104
00:56:08.265 --> 00:56:10.568
Good boy.

1105
00:56:11.569 --> 00:56:12.970
You.

1106
00:56:13.103 --> 00:56:14.672
It was all you.

1107
00:56:14.805 --> 00:56:16.206
What are you talking about.
Wolf?

1108
00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:17.608
The old lady.
the Golden Dolphin.

1109
00:56:17.742 --> 00:56:19.477
good training--
it was all to get us here.

1110
00:56:19.610 --> 00:56:21.846
so he could steal the meteorite
and let us take the fall.

1111
00:56:21.979 --> 00:56:23.648
Whoa. Whoa. what old lady?

1112
00:56:23.781 --> 00:56:26.283
And-and why would a guinea pig
want a meteorite anyway?

1113
00:56:29.319 --> 00:56:32.122
Uh. guys. he's creeping me out.

1114
00:56:32.256 --> 00:56:33.858
Wait. what? What's going on?

1115
00:56:33.991 --> 00:56:35.259
Someone turn me around.

1116
00:56:35.392 --> 00:56:37.027
Well. well.

1117
00:56:37.161 --> 00:56:39.063
So. you finally get it.

1118
00:56:39.196 --> 00:56:40.598
-Wait.
-What?

1119
00:56:40.731 --> 00:56:42.199
You stole the meteorite?

1120
00:56:42.332 --> 00:56:44.301
Oh. it's not just a meteorite.

1121
00:56:44.435 --> 00:56:45.870
I told you guys it's a butt.

1122
00:56:46.003 --> 00:56:47.204
It's not a butt!

1123
00:56:48.673 --> 00:56:51.141
It's the ultimate power source.

1124
00:56:51.275 --> 00:56:54.144
You see. when it struck.
scientists found that

1125
00:56:54.278 --> 00:56:56.013
it emitted
an electromagnetic frequency

1126
00:56:56.146 --> 00:56:58.082
unlike anything else on Earth.

1127
00:56:58.215 --> 00:56:59.884
I'm going to harness its power

1128
00:57:00.017 --> 00:57:03.220
to pull off the greatest heist
the world has ever seen.

1129
00:57:04.021 --> 00:57:05.956
You should've eaten him
when you had the chance.

1130
00:57:06.090 --> 00:57:07.558
-Yep.
-But why us?

1131
00:57:07.692 --> 00:57:09.927
Because you're
the perfect patsies.

1132
00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:13.531
Come on. when people look up
"bad" in the dictionary.

1133
00:57:13.664 --> 00:57:16.133
do they see a sweet.
adorable guinea pig?

1134
00:57:16.266 --> 00:57:18.135
No. They see you.

1135
00:57:18.268 --> 00:57:20.505
And they always will.

1136
00:57:20.638 --> 00:57:21.906
Okay. fine.

1137
00:57:22.039 --> 00:57:23.307
But you set us up.

1138
00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:24.709
Oh. pish-pish.

1139
00:57:24.842 --> 00:57:27.678
Let's be honest--
evolution set you up.

1140
00:57:27.812 --> 00:57:30.014
But Wolfie here
really clinched it.

1141
00:57:30.147 --> 00:57:32.950
You fell for every one
of my traps.

1142
00:57:33.083 --> 00:57:36.887
starting with saving
a helpless little old lady.

1143
00:57:37.021 --> 00:57:40.190
Wolf. what's he talking about?

1144
00:57:42.459 --> 00:57:43.994
Whoops.

1145
00:57:44.128 --> 00:57:46.864
Did I say too much?

1146
00:57:46.997 --> 00:57:49.333
Anyhoo. looks like. yet again.

1147
00:57:49.466 --> 00:57:53.103
the Big Bad Wolf got outsmarted
by a little piggy.

1148
00:57:53.237 --> 00:57:56.073
You little pouchy-cheeked rat!

1149
00:57:56.206 --> 00:57:57.608
I'll kill you! You hear me?

1150
00:57:57.742 --> 00:57:59.877
-You're dead! You're de...
-Help! Help! Help!

1151
00:58:00.010 --> 00:58:01.646
The Big Bad Wolf
is attacking me.

1152
00:58:01.779 --> 00:58:04.314
Oh. now you are done
forever. Wolf!

1153
00:58:13.558 --> 00:58:15.392
-- Professor. Professor.

1154
00:58:15.526 --> 00:58:17.461
any thoughts
on how the Bad Guys managed

1155
00:58:17.595 --> 00:58:19.997
to steal the meteorite
in plain sight?

1156
00:58:20.130 --> 00:58:21.365
Well. off the top of my head.

1157
00:58:21.498 --> 00:58:23.233
perhaps they accessed the site
previously

1158
00:58:23.367 --> 00:58:24.635
and set up an intricate system

1159
00:58:24.769 --> 00:58:26.303
-of tunnels and trapdoors...
-- Uh-huh.

1160
00:58:26.436 --> 00:58:27.772
- ...that could be
remotely triggered

1161
00:58:27.905 --> 00:58:29.373
to suck the meteorite down
into a holding area.

1162
00:58:29.506 --> 00:58:31.075
-but how should I know?
-- Totally.

1163
00:58:31.208 --> 00:58:33.944
- I mean. they're the
deranged masterminds. not me.

1164
00:58:56.166 --> 00:58:58.636
I'm giving it all back.

1165
00:59:22.492 --> 00:59:24.228
- I can't believe
we got double-crossed

1166
00:59:24.361 --> 00:59:25.663
by a tiny rodent.

1167
00:59:25.796 --> 00:59:28.132
Oh. we got double-crossed
by a rodent all right.

1168
00:59:28.265 --> 00:59:30.968
-but. uh. not a tiny one.
-What?

1169
00:59:31.101 --> 00:59:33.604
This was supposed to be
us conning Marmalade.

1170
00:59:33.738 --> 00:59:36.907
It turns out
it was Wolf conning us.

1171
00:59:38.709 --> 00:59:40.577
Does that sound familiar
to you. Wolf?

1172
00:59:40.711 --> 00:59:42.379
Why-why would you think that?

1173
00:59:42.512 --> 00:59:45.115
Oh. I don't know. maybe because
you just sabotaged

1174
00:59:45.249 --> 00:59:47.351
the biggest heist of our lives.

1175
00:59:47.484 --> 00:59:50.587
I think you owe us
an explanation. buddy.

1176
00:59:52.156 --> 00:59:53.257
Okay. You're right.

1177
00:59:53.390 --> 00:59:54.925
This is what happened.

1178
00:59:55.059 --> 00:59:57.594
Back in the museum. I just tried
to steal an old lady's purse.

1179
00:59:57.728 --> 00:59:59.563
-Classic snatch and grab.

1180
00:59:59.697 --> 01:00:01.899
Tried to? Since when do you try

1181
01:00:02.032 --> 01:00:03.901
to steal something
and not just steal it?

1182
01:00:04.034 --> 01:00:07.271
I was trying to steal the purse
when the old lady fell and...

1183
01:00:07.404 --> 01:00:09.373
I kind of helped her.

1184
01:00:09.506 --> 01:00:10.407
-What?

1185
01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:12.509
I kind of helped her.

1186
01:00:12.643 --> 01:00:14.511
-But then you stole her purse.

1187
01:00:14.645 --> 01:00:15.946
No. I didn't.

1188
01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:18.448
I saved the old lady.
and she hugged me.

1189
01:00:18.582 --> 01:00:21.085
and my tail wagged.
and I didn't know what it was.

1190
01:00:21.218 --> 01:00:24.588
but it felt. uh.
you know... good.

1191
01:00:26.323 --> 01:00:27.357
Ah.

1192
01:00:27.491 --> 01:00:29.293
But then you stole the purse.

1193
01:00:29.426 --> 01:00:30.861
No!

1194
01:00:30.995 --> 01:00:33.230
You know. I heard
what the pig said to you

1195
01:00:33.363 --> 01:00:34.932
about cutting us loose.

1196
01:00:35.065 --> 01:00:36.734
Wait. Like. "us" us?

1197
01:00:36.867 --> 01:00:38.836
But I never thought
you'd actually do it. man.

1198
01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:40.404
Hey. hey. hey. hey.

1199
01:00:40.537 --> 01:00:42.940
I-I would never...
I was trying to...

1200
01:00:43.073 --> 01:00:45.142
I was trying to find us
a better life.

1201
01:00:45.275 --> 01:00:48.746
Our life was perfect
until you decided to ruin it.

1202
01:00:48.879 --> 01:00:50.080
I didn't.

1203
01:00:50.214 --> 01:00:51.648
You guys felt it at the gala.

1204
01:00:51.782 --> 01:00:53.617
The clapping. the cheering.

1205
01:00:53.751 --> 01:00:56.020
We were more than...
than just scary villains.

1206
01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:57.254
They loved us.

1207
01:00:57.387 --> 01:00:59.824
Oh. yeah?
If they loved us so much.

1208
01:00:59.957 --> 01:01:03.560
how come we're in prison
for a crime we didn't commit?

1209
01:01:03.694 --> 01:01:05.830
You know what?
I'll give Marmalade this.

1210
01:01:05.963 --> 01:01:07.998
At least he sees the world
for what it is:

1211
01:01:08.132 --> 01:01:10.267
a place where
some people are scary

1212
01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.302
and some people are scared.

1213
01:01:12.436 --> 01:01:13.670
Oh. yeah?

1214
01:01:13.804 --> 01:01:15.372
Well. I'm tired of being scary.

1215
01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:17.074
I'm-I'm tired of
being an outcast.

1216
01:01:17.207 --> 01:01:18.809
Maybe I don't want to be a...

1217
01:01:18.943 --> 01:01:20.277
What? A Bad Guy?

1218
01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:22.446
Don't want to be
a Bad Guy anymore. huh?

1219
01:01:22.579 --> 01:01:24.681
Say it. Wolf.

1220
01:01:26.751 --> 01:01:28.218
Yeah. I thought so.

1221
01:01:28.352 --> 01:01:30.354
And us. your lifelong friends?

1222
01:01:30.487 --> 01:01:31.956
We're just holding you back?

1223
01:01:32.089 --> 01:01:33.891
Yeah. maybe you are!

1224
01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:37.862
Take it back!

1225
01:01:37.995 --> 01:01:40.464
-Take it back! Apologize!

1226
01:01:40.597 --> 01:01:42.332
Hey. hey. hey. hey. hey. hey!

1227
01:01:42.466 --> 01:01:43.968
Prison is no place for fighting.

1228
01:01:45.569 --> 01:01:47.371
Tell that to him.

1229
01:01:47.504 --> 01:01:48.839
Huh?

1230
01:01:52.977 --> 01:01:55.545
-What?

1231
01:02:12.229 --> 01:02:13.798
-Shh.

1232
01:02:29.746 --> 01:02:31.949
Run!

1233
01:02:38.388 --> 01:02:39.957
-Oh!
-W-W-Wait. wait. Ho-Hold on.

1234
01:02:42.359 --> 01:02:43.293
Diane?

1235
01:02:43.427 --> 01:02:44.561
But how do you know how to do

1236
01:02:44.694 --> 01:02:45.863
all of that
kick-kick-punch-punch?

1237
01:02:45.996 --> 01:02:48.232
Wait a sec.
you're the Crimson Paw?

1238
01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:52.236
The queen of cons.

1239
01:02:52.369 --> 01:02:53.637
acrobatic Swiss Army knife.

1240
01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:55.105
Stole the Zumpango diamond
twice.

1241
01:02:55.239 --> 01:02:57.607
Once for profit.
second time just for fun.

1242
01:02:57.741 --> 01:03:00.144
Never identified. never caught.

1243
01:03:00.277 --> 01:03:03.113
Guess I'm still
the best bad guy

1244
01:03:03.247 --> 01:03:05.115
the world has ever seen.

1245
01:03:05.249 --> 01:03:07.684
-Ugh. at least I used to be.

1246
01:03:07.818 --> 01:03:09.153
-- Huh?

1247
01:03:18.495 --> 01:03:20.197
Nope. I'm still the best.

1248
01:03:20.330 --> 01:03:22.732
Just like riding
a stolen bicycle.

1249
01:03:22.867 --> 01:03:25.402
Oh. uh. you got a little...
Ouch.

1250
01:03:25.535 --> 01:03:27.604
Hey. wh-why did you
save us anyway?

1251
01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:29.840
After the gala.
I knew something wasn't right.

1252
01:03:29.974 --> 01:03:31.976
so I did some investigating.
and that meteor...

1253
01:03:32.109 --> 01:03:35.379
I know. Some kind of cosmic
mega-super-antennae thing.

1254
01:03:35.512 --> 01:03:38.215
Right. If conducted through
an array of ionized crystals.

1255
01:03:38.348 --> 01:03:40.217
it will generate a massive
psychokinetic field

1256
01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:41.551
the size of a city.

1257
01:03:41.685 --> 01:03:43.020
Oh. my gosh.
Did I interrupt you?

1258
01:03:43.153 --> 01:03:44.254
Were you gonna say that?

1259
01:03:44.388 --> 01:03:46.957
Uh. I-I-I was gonna be
a little more technical.

1260
01:03:47.091 --> 01:03:49.994
-but you got the gist of it.

1261
01:03:51.061 --> 01:03:54.198
Marmalade needs to be stopped.
but I can't do it alone.

1262
01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:56.433
You know his compound
better than anyone.

1263
01:03:56.566 --> 01:03:58.202
You can count on us.

1264
01:03:58.335 --> 01:03:59.503
Right. guys?

1265
01:03:59.636 --> 01:04:01.538
There is no "us."

1266
01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:03.207
We're through. Wolf.

1267
01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:04.741
Done. Finito.

1268
01:04:04.875 --> 01:04:07.211
Because of that little tiff
back there?

1269
01:04:07.344 --> 01:04:09.546
Come on. man. that's what we do.

1270
01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:11.248
You serve. I volley.

1271
01:04:11.381 --> 01:04:13.350
That's our little dance.

1272
01:04:13.483 --> 01:04:15.552
Not this time.

1273
01:04:20.324 --> 01:04:21.725
Piranha?

1274
01:04:25.095 --> 01:04:26.296
Webs?

1275
01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:28.032
Sorry. Wolfie.

1276
01:04:29.799 --> 01:04:31.101
Shark.

1277
01:04:31.235 --> 01:04:32.602
Hmm.

1278
01:04:32.736 --> 01:04:34.404
Hey.

1279
01:04:34.538 --> 01:04:36.106
Guys?

1280
01:04:37.074 --> 01:04:38.375
Guys?

1281
01:04:39.176 --> 01:04:42.712
You want to know why
I hate birthdays. Wolf? Do you?

1282
01:04:44.048 --> 01:04:47.817
When you grow up a snake.
nobody shows up to your party.

1283
01:04:47.952 --> 01:04:50.921
Birthdays are a constant
reminder that out there

1284
01:04:51.055 --> 01:04:56.060
I'm just a scary.
good-for-nothing monster.

1285
01:04:57.494 --> 01:04:59.163
Yeah.

1286
01:04:59.296 --> 01:05:02.099
But nothing compares
to having the one guy...

1287
01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:05.502
the one guy I thought
I could trust

1288
01:05:05.635 --> 01:05:07.737
stab me in the back.

1289
01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:13.910
Come on. guys.
Let's get out of here.

1290
01:06:00.991 --> 01:06:05.029
Now. this is what
a true bad guy looks like.

1291
01:06:11.068 --> 01:06:13.903
What do you say
we have some fun?

1292
01:06:52.809 --> 01:06:55.545
Hey. You okay?

1293
01:06:55.679 --> 01:06:57.314
No. I'm not okay.

1294
01:06:57.447 --> 01:07:00.150
I'm very. very un-okay.

1295
01:07:01.451 --> 01:07:03.320
Just left the only friends
I have ever had.

1296
01:07:03.453 --> 01:07:06.790
so what am I...
what am I doing?

1297
01:07:09.593 --> 01:07:12.396
I know this isn't easy.

1298
01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:14.664
leaving everything behind.

1299
01:07:14.798 --> 01:07:16.133
-Do you?
-Yeah.

1300
01:07:16.266 --> 01:07:18.602
I was the best thief
in the world.

1301
01:07:18.735 --> 01:07:22.606
Fast. fearless. inventive.

1302
01:07:22.739 --> 01:07:25.575
I just had one thing
left to steal.

1303
01:07:25.709 --> 01:07:27.344
The Golden Dolphin.

1304
01:07:27.477 --> 01:07:29.346
So you went after it.

1305
01:07:29.479 --> 01:07:31.348
I didn't just go after it.

1306
01:07:32.516 --> 01:07:34.418
I had it.

1307
01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:36.786
And a clear escape route.

1308
01:07:39.356 --> 01:07:41.325
But...

1309
01:07:41.458 --> 01:07:43.960
all I saw in the end
was the tricky fox

1310
01:07:44.094 --> 01:07:46.863
that they always told me I was.

1311
01:07:47.897 --> 01:07:50.100
It changed everything.

1312
01:07:50.234 --> 01:07:52.702
So. now.
instead of hurting people.

1313
01:07:52.836 --> 01:07:54.404
I'm helping them.

1314
01:07:54.538 --> 01:07:56.106
I'm still me.

1315
01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:59.343
I'm just me on the right side.

1316
01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:02.279
You're doing the right thing.

1317
01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:05.882
And someday your friends.
if they're real friends.

1318
01:08:06.015 --> 01:08:08.218
I think they'll understand.

1319
01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:11.155
Now. come on. let's get inside.

1320
01:08:11.288 --> 01:08:14.124
-You look like you just busted
out of a prison. -

1321
01:08:17.661 --> 01:08:18.995
-Guinea pigs?

1322
01:08:19.129 --> 01:08:20.464
Marmalade.

1323
01:08:20.597 --> 01:08:21.598
Let's bounce.

1324
01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:26.136
So this is the hideout
of the great Crimson Paw.

1325
01:08:27.671 --> 01:08:28.805
Snack break?

1326
01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:30.674
Okay. oddly timed.
but you do you.

1327
01:08:32.008 --> 01:08:33.042
Identity verified.

1328
01:08:33.177 --> 01:08:35.412
-What?
-Welcome. Diane.

1329
01:08:41.151 --> 01:08:44.221
-Whoa! Holy moly!

1330
01:08:44.354 --> 01:08:46.656
It's so good to be home.

1331
01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:47.891
Are you kidding me?

1332
01:08:48.024 --> 01:08:49.659
Laser-sighted zip line?

1333
01:08:49.793 --> 01:08:52.362
The XM-2400 radar jammer?
No way.

1334
01:08:52.496 --> 01:08:54.631
I actually prefer
the earlier model.

1335
01:08:54.764 --> 01:08:56.533
Agree to disagree.

1336
01:08:56.666 --> 01:08:58.268
Uh. this stuff is nice. too.

1337
01:08:59.569 --> 01:09:00.904
Yeah. that's a blowtorch.

1338
01:09:01.037 --> 01:09:03.039
Also. not really your color.

1339
01:09:04.474 --> 01:09:06.142
All righty. Marmalade.

1340
01:09:06.276 --> 01:09:09.813
What are you up to.
you fuzzy little weirdo?

1341
01:09:09.946 --> 01:09:11.481
We need eyes on the city.

1342
01:09:11.615 --> 01:09:12.949
Let's see if we can't hack

1343
01:09:13.082 --> 01:09:14.351
into the government's
surveillance satellite.

1344
01:09:14.484 --> 01:09:16.220
But you're the governor.
Couldn't you just ask?

1345
01:09:16.353 --> 01:09:18.522
Yeah. but...
the paperwork.

1346
01:09:23.393 --> 01:09:27.163
I am definitely picking up
on suspicious activity here.

1347
01:09:27.297 --> 01:09:29.466
Those are guinea pig
heat signatures.

1348
01:09:29.599 --> 01:09:31.868
Marmalade seems to be
controlling them.

1349
01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:34.003
But to do what?

1350
01:09:34.137 --> 01:09:35.572
There are no obvious targets.

1351
01:09:37.574 --> 01:09:39.976
That's because
they're moving targets.

1352
01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:43.079
His charity fundraiser.

1353
01:09:43.213 --> 01:09:45.482
He's gonna steal the money
raised in his own name?

1354
01:09:45.615 --> 01:09:48.151
It's the greatest heist
the world's ever seen.

1355
01:09:48.285 --> 01:09:50.320
$1 billion inside trucks.

1356
01:09:50.454 --> 01:09:52.456
on their way to charities
all over the city.

1357
01:09:52.589 --> 01:09:53.990
We need to cut off
Marmalade's communication

1358
01:09:54.123 --> 01:09:55.158
with his guinea pig army.

1359
01:09:55.292 --> 01:09:56.826
If there's no signal...

1360
01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.161
There's no heist.

1361
01:09:58.295 --> 01:10:00.397
We have to steal the meteorite.

1362
01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:01.631
That was very cute.

1363
01:10:01.765 --> 01:10:03.199
-that thing we just did there.
-All right.

1364
01:10:03.333 --> 01:10:05.702
Put on your big-girl pants.
We're gearing up.

1365
01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:13.009
I wouldn't take that.

1366
01:10:13.142 --> 01:10:14.678
Those things rip your pants
right off.

1367
01:10:14.811 --> 01:10:16.513
Huh. Try wearing
clean underwear.

1368
01:10:16.646 --> 01:10:18.448
Just in case.

1369
01:10:19.416 --> 01:10:20.550
Wha...

1370
01:10:21.885 --> 01:10:24.153
You stole my car?

1371
01:10:24.288 --> 01:10:25.555
Respect.

1372
01:10:25.689 --> 01:10:28.325
-Let's do this.

1373
01:10:39.769 --> 01:10:40.770
-No!
-What?

1374
01:10:40.904 --> 01:10:42.272
All our stuff?

1375
01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:44.574
-Where is everything?
-No. no. no. no. no.

1376
01:10:44.708 --> 01:10:46.376
-No. no. no. no. no. no. no. no!
-All our stuff.

1377
01:10:46.510 --> 01:10:48.278
-It's all gone.
-My disguise closet!

1378
01:10:48.412 --> 01:10:50.647
-- Where's my things?

1379
01:10:51.748 --> 01:10:54.017
Wolf gave away all our loot.

1380
01:10:54.150 --> 01:10:56.453
We stole it fair and square.

1381
01:10:56.586 --> 01:10:58.588
Now I understand
what it feels like

1382
01:10:58.722 --> 01:11:01.358
to have things stolen from you.

1383
01:11:01.491 --> 01:11:03.192
I don't like it!

1384
01:11:03.327 --> 01:11:06.029
I really don't like it!

1385
01:11:11.535 --> 01:11:14.037
- We got no food.
We got no money.

1386
01:11:14.170 --> 01:11:15.572
We got no money
we could use to buy food.

1387
01:11:15.705 --> 01:11:17.674
No food we can sell for money.

1388
01:11:17.807 --> 01:11:19.876
We...

1389
01:11:20.009 --> 01:11:22.078
All right. okay. okay.

1390
01:11:22.211 --> 01:11:24.481
Here. here. Take it.

1391
01:11:24.614 --> 01:11:26.650
Now. stop crying. buddy.

1392
01:11:29.353 --> 01:11:33.990
Um. Snake. what did you just do?

1393
01:11:34.123 --> 01:11:35.792
What? My friend was sad.

1394
01:11:35.925 --> 01:11:37.361
I was just cheering him up.

1395
01:11:37.494 --> 01:11:39.863
You... you did a good thing.

1396
01:11:39.996 --> 01:11:41.865
-For me.
-Don't be ridiculous.

1397
01:11:41.998 --> 01:11:44.200
I just put your needs
before my own.

1398
01:11:44.334 --> 01:11:46.703
-Yeah. You're being good.
-I'm not.

1399
01:11:46.836 --> 01:11:49.739
I was simply making a sacrifice
so Shark could be happy.

1400
01:11:49.873 --> 01:11:52.876
That is the actual definition
of being good.

1401
01:11:53.009 --> 01:11:54.911
Snake. you.

1402
01:11:55.044 --> 01:11:57.146
the worst one of us.
the most selfish.

1403
01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:58.748
-Spiteful.
-Terrible.

1404
01:11:58.882 --> 01:11:59.983
-Sneaky.
-Dishonest.

1405
01:12:00.116 --> 01:12:01.150
-Insensitive.
-Manipulative.

1406
01:12:01.284 --> 01:12:02.652
-Snakelike.
-Stanky.

1407
01:12:02.786 --> 01:12:04.688
And your point is?

1408
01:12:04.821 --> 01:12:06.590
I think Wolf was right.

1409
01:12:06.723 --> 01:12:09.726
Maybe we could be more
than just scary villains.

1410
01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:14.197
Wh...?

1411
01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:16.032
Oh. wow.

1412
01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:18.668
Is this... is this wagging?

1413
01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:21.337
We're-we're wagging.

1414
01:12:23.139 --> 01:12:25.842
No. no. no!

1415
01:12:25.975 --> 01:12:30.079
We'll always be Bad Guys!

1416
01:12:56.005 --> 01:12:58.442
Faster. faster. my little pigs.

1417
01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:44.020
Once we steal the meteorite.

1418
01:13:44.153 --> 01:13:45.889
we take it straight
to the police.

1419
01:13:46.022 --> 01:13:47.624
And all will be forgiven.

1420
01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:51.194
I don't know about "all."
but it's a start.

1421
01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:11.915
That's strange.

1422
01:14:12.048 --> 01:14:15.151
Why would Marmalade leave
the Golden Dolphin unprotected?

1423
01:14:15.284 --> 01:14:18.154
-Because maybe it's a trap.
-Or maybe...

1424
01:14:18.287 --> 01:14:20.423
-Wait. wait. wait!

1425
01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:22.325
Yeah. it was a trap.

1426
01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:23.893
Well. well. well.

1427
01:14:24.027 --> 01:14:26.496
If it isn't my prized pupil.

1428
01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:28.698
And you've brought along
the governor.

1429
01:14:28.832 --> 01:14:30.166
Or should I say...

1430
01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:31.768
-the Crimson Paw?

1431
01:14:31.901 --> 01:14:36.706
Mm. what an ingenious way
to disguise a Zumpango diamond.

1432
01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:39.042
hiding it in plain sight.

1433
01:14:39.175 --> 01:14:41.144
You got to be kidding me.

1434
01:14:41.277 --> 01:14:43.012
What? I'm sentimental.

1435
01:14:43.146 --> 01:14:44.648
You always did have panache.

1436
01:14:44.781 --> 01:14:47.684
And yet. you still fell
right into my trap.

1437
01:14:47.817 --> 01:14:50.053
But how did you know
we'd even be here?

1438
01:14:50.186 --> 01:14:53.222
Oh. I got a little tip
from a friend.

1439
01:14:54.858 --> 01:14:56.159
Hey. buddy.

1440
01:14:56.292 --> 01:14:57.594
How's it hanging?

1441
01:14:57.727 --> 01:15:00.229
-Snake.

1442
01:15:00.363 --> 01:15:02.098
What can I say? We just clicked.

1443
01:15:02.231 --> 01:15:05.902
Oh. yeah? How's it feel to be
working for your favorite food?

1444
01:15:06.035 --> 01:15:07.937
Ah. you're just jealous

1445
01:15:08.071 --> 01:15:10.339
to be missing out
on the heist of the century.

1446
01:15:10.473 --> 01:15:12.141
It's got everything:

1447
01:15:12.275 --> 01:15:15.178
betrayal. a meteor.
mind control.

1448
01:15:15.311 --> 01:15:16.713
Can I try it on?

1449
01:15:16.846 --> 01:15:18.514
Of course. partner.

1450
01:15:18.648 --> 01:15:22.586
Nice. All the crime
with none of the exercise.

1451
01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:25.822
What about all that
"flower of goodness" talk?

1452
01:15:25.955 --> 01:15:27.123
Was it all just a lie?

1453
01:15:27.256 --> 01:15:28.925
Uh. pretty much. yeah.

1454
01:15:29.058 --> 01:15:31.260
You see. I never cared
about what's "good."

1455
01:15:31.394 --> 01:15:33.362
Only what's good for me.

1456
01:15:33.496 --> 01:15:35.965
Like. say. a billion dollars.

1457
01:15:36.099 --> 01:15:38.868
Ooh. I just got a tingle.

1458
01:15:40.336 --> 01:15:41.838
Go bad...

1459
01:15:41.971 --> 01:15:44.040
Or go home.

1460
01:15:44.173 --> 01:15:46.676
Cuddles. finish them.

1461
01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:56.853
Poison gas.

1462
01:15:56.986 --> 01:15:58.254
Don't breathe it in.

1463
01:15:58.387 --> 01:16:00.256
Wait a second.

1464
01:16:00.389 --> 01:16:02.125
That's not poison gas.

1465
01:16:04.027 --> 01:16:04.928
-- Sorry!

1466
01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:07.330
Surprise!

1467
01:16:07.463 --> 01:16:10.266
What? Ah. guys.

1468
01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:11.835
I can't believe it's you.

1469
01:16:11.968 --> 01:16:14.403
-You were right. Wolfie.
-We felt the wag. man.

1470
01:16:14.537 --> 01:16:16.105
-- And the tingle.
-It's good. right?

1471
01:16:16.239 --> 01:16:17.540
This is super moving.

1472
01:16:17.674 --> 01:16:19.275
but can we do this later?

1473
01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:21.711
Feels like I got
a rhythm section in my fin.

1474
01:16:23.346 --> 01:16:25.214
-Ah. ah!
-- Ugh. Come on.

1475
01:16:25.348 --> 01:16:26.249
Spinning blades!

1476
01:16:26.382 --> 01:16:27.617
Oh. yeah. Right.

1477
01:16:27.751 --> 01:16:28.952
Sorry. I got it.

1478
01:16:31.254 --> 01:16:32.789
-Guys...

1479
01:16:32.922 --> 01:16:35.424
Am I happy to see you.

1480
01:16:38.361 --> 01:16:39.729
Now it's time to huff and puff

1481
01:16:39.863 --> 01:16:41.831
and blow this little piggy's
heist down.

1482
01:16:41.965 --> 01:16:43.566
Game over. guinea pig.

1483
01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:47.003
With this meteorite.
we will be able to commit crimes

1484
01:16:47.136 --> 01:16:49.072
people have only dreamed about.

1485
01:16:49.205 --> 01:16:51.140
Not bad for a butt rock.

1486
01:16:51.274 --> 01:16:54.110
Once again. it's not a...

1487
01:16:54.243 --> 01:16:55.779
-Don't mind us.

1488
01:16:55.912 --> 01:16:57.681
Just robbing this place.

1489
01:17:00.116 --> 01:17:01.584
No. no. no!

1490
01:17:07.523 --> 01:17:09.125
Here. kitty. kitty.
kitty. kitty.

1491
01:17:26.242 --> 01:17:27.677
-All right!
-We did it!

1492
01:17:27.811 --> 01:17:30.513
Now to get this thing to
the chief and clear your names.

1493
01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:32.749
Weird. Usually. we drive
away from the police.

1494
01:17:32.882 --> 01:17:35.384
Hey. chico. are you sure
we stopped the heist?

1495
01:17:35.518 --> 01:17:37.120
-Yeah.
-Relax.

1496
01:17:37.253 --> 01:17:39.522
Marmalade can't control them if
he doesn't have the meteorite.

1497
01:17:39.655 --> 01:17:41.891
So. who's driving those trucks?

1498
01:17:45.294 --> 01:17:47.163
The meteorite.

1499
01:17:47.296 --> 01:17:48.597
-It's still transmitting.
-Uh-oh.

1500
01:17:48.732 --> 01:17:50.967
The charity money.
Change of plan. guys.

1501
01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:52.601
Webs. is there some way
to override

1502
01:17:52.736 --> 01:17:54.037
the truck's navigation system?

1503
01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:55.338
Uh. we'd need some kind of

1504
01:17:55.471 --> 01:17:57.240
magnetized cross-circuit
interceptor.

1505
01:17:57.373 --> 01:17:59.342
You mean this?

1506
01:17:59.475 --> 01:18:01.711
Ooh! She just keeps
getting cooler!

1507
01:18:01.845 --> 01:18:02.912
Oh. yeah!

1508
01:18:12.655 --> 01:18:14.991
-Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa!

1509
01:18:18.561 --> 01:18:20.096
Oh. no.

1510
01:18:21.230 --> 01:18:22.365
We got to split up.

1511
01:18:22.498 --> 01:18:24.233
Webs. you feel like
a girls' trip?

1512
01:18:24.367 --> 01:18:25.969
Um. yes.

1513
01:18:26.102 --> 01:18:28.972
Later. boys.

1514
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:36.679
I want to go on the girls' trip.

1515
01:18:47.456 --> 01:18:48.691
Woo-hoo!

1516
01:18:53.763 --> 01:18:55.298
-You're insured. right?
-Yeah. Why?

1517
01:18:56.665 --> 01:18:59.302
Hey! That's my car!

1518
01:18:59.435 --> 01:19:02.205
It's ceviche. baby!

1519
01:19:28.497 --> 01:19:30.967
So long. suckers.

1520
01:19:48.017 --> 01:19:49.718
Where'd you learn to do that?

1521
01:19:49.853 --> 01:19:52.288
Well. I'm. you know.
kind of a natural.

1522
01:19:52.421 --> 01:19:54.057
Mostly YouTube.

1523
01:19:55.024 --> 01:19:55.892
Nice work.

1524
01:19:56.025 --> 01:19:57.460
Meet me at the police station.

1525
01:19:57.593 --> 01:19:59.595
Don't be late.

1526
01:20:00.563 --> 01:20:03.432
What do you say we deliver
this butt rock to the chief?

1527
01:20:03.566 --> 01:20:05.334
-Yeah.

1528
01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:12.408
Oh.

1529
01:20:12.541 --> 01:20:14.343
No. no. no. no!

1530
01:20:14.477 --> 01:20:16.279
That's my stolen money.

1531
01:20:16.412 --> 01:20:18.114
What good are you
if you can't even

1532
01:20:18.247 --> 01:20:19.482
anticipate their next move?

1533
01:20:19.615 --> 01:20:21.284
-Oh. so it's my fault?
-Yes.

1534
01:20:26.555 --> 01:20:28.491
-Chief.
-This better be good.

1535
01:20:28.624 --> 01:20:30.994
Trust me.
you don't want to miss this.

1536
01:20:31.127 --> 01:20:32.295
Look.

1537
01:20:33.729 --> 01:20:35.598
Well. butter my crumpets.

1538
01:20:35.731 --> 01:20:36.966
Can it be?

1539
01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:39.335
The Bad Guys are returning
the meteorite?

1540
01:20:39.468 --> 01:20:42.671
Perhaps this is
the feel-good story we all need.

1541
01:20:42.805 --> 01:20:44.140
-Woo-hoo! Yeah!
-Woo-hoo! -All right!

1542
01:20:44.273 --> 01:20:46.042
Do you guys think
they'll throw us a party?

1543
01:20:46.175 --> 01:20:49.712
Yeah. With fireworks.
piñatas and cake.

1544
01:21:06.095 --> 01:21:08.197
We can't do this without him.

1545
01:21:08.998 --> 01:21:10.866
He might be
a Mr. Grumpy Pants...

1546
01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.502
But he's our Mr. Grumpy Pants.

1547
01:21:13.636 --> 01:21:16.239
-Yeah.

1548
01:21:17.573 --> 01:21:18.942
Wolf!

1549
01:21:19.075 --> 01:21:21.978
I'm starting to see
why your friends dumped you.

1550
01:21:22.111 --> 01:21:24.280
-I don't have any friends!

1551
01:21:24.413 --> 01:21:26.983
Snake! Snake!

1552
01:21:27.116 --> 01:21:28.384
Wolf?

1553
01:21:28.517 --> 01:21:29.752
Snake. come back!

1554
01:21:29.885 --> 01:21:31.387
We need you. baby!

1555
01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:32.956
And you need us!

1556
01:21:33.089 --> 01:21:37.060
Oh. there you go again.
making it personal.

1557
01:21:37.193 --> 01:21:39.996
I'll give you one last chance
to give me the meteorite.

1558
01:21:40.129 --> 01:21:43.066
Oh. yeah?
What you gonna do. Whiskers?

1559
01:21:43.933 --> 01:21:45.401
-This.

1560
01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:48.304
What the...?

1561
01:21:54.443 --> 01:21:55.544
We've got adorable company.

1562
01:21:55.678 --> 01:21:57.713
Floor it!

1563
01:22:02.151 --> 01:22:03.686
Whoa!

1564
01:22:06.089 --> 01:22:08.324
Maybe I shouldn't have
called him Whiskers.

1565
01:22:15.731 --> 01:22:17.000
When I woke up this morning.

1566
01:22:17.133 --> 01:22:19.468
this is not where
I saw the day going.

1567
01:22:22.905 --> 01:22:24.107
Come on.

1568
01:22:25.241 --> 01:22:26.742
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

1569
01:22:26.875 --> 01:22:28.744
Hey. hey. let's dial this down
a notch. huh?

1570
01:22:28.877 --> 01:22:30.546
Besides. you'll never get him.

1571
01:22:30.679 --> 01:22:32.581
He's too good a driver.

1572
01:22:32.715 --> 01:22:34.183
Hmm. You're right.

1573
01:22:34.317 --> 01:22:36.752
But now that I think of it.
maybe it would be better

1574
01:22:36.885 --> 01:22:38.521
to exploit
his greatest weakness.

1575
01:22:38.654 --> 01:22:40.456
Exactly.

1576
01:22:40.589 --> 01:22:42.925
Wait.

1577
01:22:45.928 --> 01:22:47.896
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.
whoa. whoa. Hold on.

1578
01:22:48.031 --> 01:22:49.632
-Hold it. hold it. hold it.

1579
01:22:49.765 --> 01:22:51.467
Okay. okay. You win.

1580
01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:53.302
You can have the space rock.

1581
01:22:53.436 --> 01:22:54.803
Good boy. Wolf.

1582
01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:06.482
Take the wheel.

1583
01:23:06.615 --> 01:23:07.783
Not so fast.

1584
01:23:07.916 --> 01:23:11.220
Pull him up first.
or I'll use this.

1585
01:23:11.354 --> 01:23:13.156
Oh. come now.

1586
01:23:17.226 --> 01:23:19.928
Do it. or you'll lose the rock.

1587
01:23:20.963 --> 01:23:22.398
If you insist.

1588
01:23:22.531 --> 01:23:23.899
Cuddles!

1589
01:23:30.839 --> 01:23:33.276
You want him? He's yours.

1590
01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:39.582
Snake! No. no. no!

1591
01:23:39.715 --> 01:23:41.584
-Snake!
-Oh. no!

1592
01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:57.466
Guys. I know it's crazy.
but we're gonna jump it.

1593
01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:00.469
Crazy? You're finally speaking
my language. chico.

1594
01:24:10.779 --> 01:24:14.049
We're gonna make it!

1595
01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:16.219
No!

1596
01:24:21.524 --> 01:24:23.226
You came back.

1597
01:24:26.162 --> 01:24:27.230
Snake.

1598
01:24:27.363 --> 01:24:28.731
I should've been honest
with you.

1599
01:24:28.864 --> 01:24:30.065
I was afraid that if you knew

1600
01:24:30.199 --> 01:24:31.834
I-I wanted to be good
that you'd...

1601
01:24:31.967 --> 01:24:34.870
Act like a jerk
and never talk to you again?

1602
01:24:35.003 --> 01:24:36.672
Yeah.

1603
01:24:36.805 --> 01:24:38.774
Point is I... I-I-I. you know...

1604
01:24:38.907 --> 01:24:41.477
Yeah. I love you. too. buddy.

1605
01:24:45.714 --> 01:24:47.383
This-this is so beautiful.

1606
01:24:47.516 --> 01:24:49.918
Do you know how beautiful
this is. you guys?

1607
01:24:50.052 --> 01:24:51.154
-Now...

1608
01:24:51.287 --> 01:24:52.988
Now you're gonna make me cry.

1609
01:24:53.122 --> 01:24:54.623
I know!

1610
01:24:54.757 --> 01:24:56.225
So pathetic. right?

1611
01:24:56.359 --> 01:24:58.294
Come on. guys.

1612
01:24:58.427 --> 01:25:00.095
Who said it was the end?

1613
01:25:13.942 --> 01:25:15.911
- No. no. no. don't...
No. no. Cuddles!

1614
01:25:16.044 --> 01:25:17.680
We're losing altitude!

1615
01:25:17.813 --> 01:25:20.015
We're losing altitude!
We're going down!

1616
01:25:26.322 --> 01:25:28.224
What happened? Did we blow up?

1617
01:25:28.357 --> 01:25:30.293
Is this heaven?

1618
01:25:39.134 --> 01:25:41.003
CHIEF
That is it.

1619
01:25:41.136 --> 01:25:42.638
Hey!

1620
01:25:42.771 --> 01:25:45.808
There is absolutely no way
you're getting away this time.

1621
01:25:45.941 --> 01:25:47.843
-Wait. Chief.
-Governor Foxington?

1622
01:25:47.976 --> 01:25:49.178
-Don't do this.
-- Ow!

1623
01:25:49.312 --> 01:25:50.613
They didn't steal the meteorite.

1624
01:25:50.746 --> 01:25:51.914
They were bringing it back.

1625
01:25:52.047 --> 01:25:54.049
Ha! How could you know that?

1626
01:25:54.183 --> 01:25:57.085
Unless...
unless you were conspiring

1627
01:25:57.220 --> 01:25:59.822
with a bunch of known criminals.

1628
01:26:00.756 --> 01:26:02.691
Well...

1629
01:26:02.825 --> 01:26:05.194
as a matter of fact.

1630
01:26:05.328 --> 01:26:07.563
it's time I came clean
about something.

1631
01:26:08.364 --> 01:26:11.667
The truth is I'm really...
r-really...

1632
01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:14.270
Really a big fan
of redemption arcs.

1633
01:26:14.403 --> 01:26:16.138
Yeah. we know.

1634
01:26:21.577 --> 01:26:22.811
We're done running away.

1635
01:26:22.945 --> 01:26:23.912
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

1636
01:26:24.046 --> 01:26:25.748
-Yeah.
-Yep.

1637
01:26:25.881 --> 01:26:27.750
Chief. do what you need to do.

1638
01:26:27.883 --> 01:26:28.984
What?

1639
01:26:29.117 --> 01:26:31.887
Y-You're turning yourself in?

1640
01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:33.822
We might not have stolen
the meteorite.

1641
01:26:33.956 --> 01:26:36.292
but we did steal
a lot of other things.

1642
01:26:36.425 --> 01:26:38.827
It's time we took
some responsibility.

1643
01:26:38.961 --> 01:26:41.129
Start a clean state.

1644
01:26:41.930 --> 01:26:43.866
Take us in. Chief.

1645
01:26:44.667 --> 01:26:46.101
Wow. really?

1646
01:26:46.235 --> 01:26:47.536
You finally did it.

1647
01:26:47.670 --> 01:26:48.871
This is your moment. Chief.

1648
01:26:49.004 --> 01:26:50.239
Drink it in.

1649
01:26:50.373 --> 01:26:51.507
Wow.

1650
01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:52.975
You know. I should...
I should give a speech.

1651
01:26:53.108 --> 01:26:54.243
I... Well. I-I should.
shouldn't I?

1652
01:26:54.377 --> 01:26:56.078
-Uh...

1653
01:26:56.211 --> 01:26:57.513
When I was six years old.

1654
01:26:57.646 --> 01:26:59.282
I decided that I wanted
to play the piccolo.

1655
01:26:59.415 --> 01:27:01.250
only to find that
my fingers were just

1656
01:27:01.384 --> 01:27:04.086
too powerful for that
fragile little instrument.

1657
01:27:04.219 --> 01:27:06.689
And that's when I discovered
law enforcement.

1658
01:27:08.357 --> 01:27:10.025
I'm proud of you. Wolf.

1659
01:27:10.158 --> 01:27:13.362
You know. a fox and a wolf
are not that different.

1660
01:27:13.496 --> 01:27:15.431
You got a good thing
going here. Governor.

1661
01:27:15.564 --> 01:27:17.700
So. it turns out the saga
of the Bad Guys

1662
01:27:17.833 --> 01:27:21.337
has come to a simple and
totally satisfying conclusion.

1663
01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:24.172
Though I wonder.
what happened to the meteorite?

1664
01:27:24.307 --> 01:27:26.108
Cuddles! Faster. faster!

1665
01:27:26.241 --> 01:27:27.810
It's Professor Marmalade!

1666
01:27:27.943 --> 01:27:30.045
He's bringing
the meteorite back.

1667
01:27:30.178 --> 01:27:32.681
-Huh? Uh. yes. yes.

1668
01:27:32.815 --> 01:27:34.683
Bringing... bringing it back.

1669
01:27:34.817 --> 01:27:36.552
That's precisely
what I am doing.

1670
01:27:39.955 --> 01:27:41.890
Look no further.

1671
01:27:42.024 --> 01:27:44.192
Your hero has arrived.

1672
01:27:44.327 --> 01:27:45.761
Professor. care to comment?

1673
01:27:45.894 --> 01:27:47.530
I tried to help them. Tiffany.

1674
01:27:47.663 --> 01:27:50.333
but in the end.
it's the same old story.

1675
01:27:50.466 --> 01:27:53.369
Bad guys bad. good guys good.

1676
01:27:53.502 --> 01:27:55.003
So true. So wise.

1677
01:27:55.137 --> 01:27:56.572
Furthermore.
for the good of the city.

1678
01:27:56.705 --> 01:27:59.207
I have generously decided
to take the meteorite

1679
01:27:59.342 --> 01:28:02.044
back to my compound
for safekeeping.

1680
01:28:03.579 --> 01:28:05.180
Is he seriously gonna
get away with this?

1681
01:28:05.314 --> 01:28:07.850
Thank you. Gosh. you're kind.

1682
01:28:07.983 --> 01:28:09.785
Give it up for me!

1683
01:28:09.918 --> 01:28:11.253
Wait a second.

1684
01:28:11.387 --> 01:28:13.055
This isn't the meteorite.

1685
01:28:13.188 --> 01:28:14.757
-It's a lamp.

1686
01:28:14.890 --> 01:28:16.024
Huh?

1687
01:28:16.158 --> 01:28:17.626
-- What?

1688
01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:19.928
Snake. what did you just do?

1689
01:28:20.062 --> 01:28:21.764
What? My friend was sad.

1690
01:28:21.897 --> 01:28:23.031
and I was just cheering him up.

1691
01:28:23.165 --> 01:28:24.667
I think Wolf was right.

1692
01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:27.936
Maybe we could be more
than just scary villains.

1693
01:28:31.106 --> 01:28:32.675
I'm bad. You're bad.

1694
01:28:32.808 --> 01:28:34.142
Let's be bad together.

1695
01:28:34.276 --> 01:28:36.512
You've got yourself a deal.

1696
01:28:38.013 --> 01:28:40.883
-Can I try it on?
-Of course. partner.

1697
01:28:55.531 --> 01:28:57.232
-Don't mind us.

1698
01:28:57.366 --> 01:28:58.734
Just robbing this place.

1699
01:29:03.038 --> 01:29:05.040
No. no. no!

1700
01:29:08.744 --> 01:29:10.513
But if that's a lamp.
where is the...

1701
01:29:11.780 --> 01:29:13.015
The old switcheroo.

1702
01:29:42.745 --> 01:29:44.513
It's a butt.

1703
01:29:51.286 --> 01:29:52.488
Hold on.

1704
01:29:52.621 --> 01:29:54.890
This is the Zumpango diamond.

1705
01:29:55.023 --> 01:29:56.825
But this was stolen by the...

1706
01:29:58.461 --> 01:30:00.863
By the Crimson Paw.

1707
01:30:00.996 --> 01:30:02.397
Me? Oh. oh. no. no. no.

1708
01:30:02.531 --> 01:30:04.299
-OMG. -- No. no. no.
No. you've got it wrong.

1709
01:30:04.433 --> 01:30:06.268
-And a shocking twist.
-You're making a huge mistake!

1710
01:30:06.401 --> 01:30:09.672
The notorious bandit
known as the Crimson Paw

1711
01:30:09.805 --> 01:30:11.406
-has been revealed to be...
-No! No!

1712
01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:13.075
...none other
than Professor Marmalade.

1713
01:30:13.208 --> 01:30:14.443
I'm not the Crimson Paw.

1714
01:30:14.577 --> 01:30:16.211
-Sh-She's the Crimson Paw.

1715
01:30:16.344 --> 01:30:17.913
Sh-She's the Paw!

1716
01:30:18.046 --> 01:30:20.048
I'm a flower of goodness. No!

1717
01:30:20.182 --> 01:30:22.250
Ooh! That's my reptile
right there.

1718
01:30:22.384 --> 01:30:24.119
-That's what I'm talking about!
All right! -Yeah!

1719
01:30:24.252 --> 01:30:26.388
Come on. somebody had to
destroy that meteorite.

1720
01:30:26.522 --> 01:30:28.356
That thing was dangerous.

1721
01:30:28.491 --> 01:30:30.358
That was pretty good there.
Snakey.

1722
01:30:30.493 --> 01:30:32.728
Good? It was genius.

1723
01:30:32.861 --> 01:30:34.563
Not only did I foil the pig.

1724
01:30:34.697 --> 01:30:37.232
I got you to admit
how much you care about me.

1725
01:30:37.365 --> 01:30:38.634
Sure. yeah.

1726
01:30:38.767 --> 01:30:40.368
I just wonder about
one little thing.

1727
01:30:40.503 --> 01:30:41.904
Oh. yeah? What's that. Wolf?

1728
01:30:42.037 --> 01:30:46.241
Who do you think put that
one Push Pop in the fridge?

1729
01:30:47.676 --> 01:30:48.977
Wait.

1730
01:30:49.111 --> 01:30:50.646
You... No.

1731
01:30:50.779 --> 01:30:52.114
I knew you were good.

1732
01:30:52.247 --> 01:30:54.517
-No.

1733
01:30:54.650 --> 01:30:57.452
-We good. baby. We good.
-Yeah!

1734
01:31:41.897 --> 01:31:44.299
- Okay. so imagine
it's your birthday.

1735
01:31:44.432 --> 01:31:45.801
It is my birthday.

1736
01:31:45.934 --> 01:31:47.469
- Yeah. I know.
So. but we're walking along

1737
01:31:47.603 --> 01:31:48.971
and you meet a genie.

1738
01:31:49.104 --> 01:31:50.438
Okay. What's his name?

1739
01:31:50.573 --> 01:31:51.807
What's the genie's name?

1740
01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:53.441
Yeah. I want to know
who I'm talking to.

1741
01:31:53.576 --> 01:31:54.977
I don't know.
Genie or Gene for short.

1742
01:31:55.110 --> 01:31:56.645
So he offers you three wishes.

1743
01:31:56.779 --> 01:31:57.813
Why three?

1744
01:31:57.946 --> 01:31:59.081
You know. industry standard.

1745
01:31:59.214 --> 01:32:00.482
Now. what do you wish for?

1746
01:32:00.616 --> 01:32:02.250
-Uh...
-Good luck out there. guys.

1747
01:32:02.384 --> 01:32:03.752
I'm gonna go with nothing.

1748
01:32:03.886 --> 01:32:05.053
Nothing?

1749
01:32:05.187 --> 01:32:06.622
Come on. it's your birthday.

1750
01:32:06.755 --> 01:32:08.757
All right.
but what do I need wishes for?

1751
01:32:08.891 --> 01:32:10.325
I got my freedom.

1752
01:32:10.458 --> 01:32:11.393
-Hey.
-Guys!

1753
01:32:11.526 --> 01:32:12.761
Looking good. hermanos.

1754
01:32:12.895 --> 01:32:14.663
-I got my friends.
-- Aw.

1755
01:32:14.797 --> 01:32:16.665
I got the skin of a reptile
half my age.

1756
01:32:16.799 --> 01:32:19.101
I don't know about half
your age. but you do look good.

1757
01:32:19.234 --> 01:32:20.569
Well. that's because
you just molted.

1758
01:32:20.703 --> 01:32:22.805
-Yes. I did.
-- You smell good. too.

1759
01:32:22.938 --> 01:32:26.374
-I'm shiny. I'm gorgeous.

1760
01:32:32.180 --> 01:32:35.150
Uh. so what do we do now?

1761
01:32:35.283 --> 01:32:37.052
-Steal a car?
-Piranha!

1762
01:32:37.185 --> 01:32:38.854
I was joking.

1763
01:32:38.987 --> 01:32:40.322
It was a joke.

1764
01:32:40.455 --> 01:32:42.057
You know.
on second thought. Wolf.

1765
01:32:42.190 --> 01:32:44.226
maybe I'd. uh. wish for a ride.

1766
01:32:44.359 --> 01:32:46.428
-Oh. yeah? Alakazam.

1767
01:32:48.697 --> 01:32:49.998
-Nice.

1768
01:32:50.132 --> 01:32:52.968
-Hey. guys.
Ready to get to work? -

1769
01:32:53.101 --> 01:32:54.269
Hey. Whoa.

1770
01:32:54.402 --> 01:32:56.271
Aw.

1771
01:32:59.107 --> 01:33:00.308
Hey. you.

1772
01:33:00.442 --> 01:33:01.810
That's right. Come here.

1773
01:33:01.944 --> 01:33:03.078
Little closer.

1774
01:33:03.211 --> 01:33:04.780
I said closer.

1775
01:33:04.913 --> 01:33:08.116
Now that we've had some time
to get acquainted. uh.

1776
01:33:08.250 --> 01:33:10.753
