3
00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.181
With god. all
things are possible.

4
00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:18.184
Matthew 19:26.

5
00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:20.978
Over the years. I've shared
that verse more times

6
00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:22.897
than I could ever count.

7
00:00:22.898 --> 00:00:26.192
But now. for the first
time. I know it's true.

8
00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:27.818
You see. six months ago.

9
00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:31.239
something impossible
did happen down there.

10
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.865
One instant of time.

11
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:36.202
millions of people just
disappeared without a trace.

12
00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:38.829
poof. gone just like that.

13
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.290
Well. if that's not impossible.

14
00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:42.626
then I don't know what is.

15
00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:45.545
- As cleanup efforts
continue in the aftermath of

16
00:00:45.546 --> 00:00:48.589
the vanishings. single
most catastrophic event

17
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.842
in all of human history
and security forces work

18
00:00:51.843 --> 00:00:53.886
to stem worldwide violence.

19
00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:56.639
there is still more
questions than answers.

20
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.183
Today. people
still say the vanishings

21
00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:02.645
came without a warning or
any kind of explanation.

22
00:01:02.646 --> 00:01:04.522
but that's just not true.

23
00:01:04.523 --> 00:01:07.483
There were plenty of
warnings and explanations.

24
00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:10.444
but there were also
plenty of closed minds.

25
00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:12.989
While the president insists
that the greatest threat

26
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.242
to our country is those clinging
to the conspiracy theory.

27
00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:19.579
that somehow god had something
to do with the vanishings.

28
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.664
And we all
know that a closed mind

29
00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:24.083
is not an easy thing to pry open.

30
00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:27.003
But even after watching all
those people just vanish

31
00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:28.379
into thin air.

32
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.756
most people still had
no interest in the fact

33
00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:34.343
that all of it was written
down thousands of years ago

34
00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:37.346
in that dusty old book on the shelf.

35
00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:40.808
It's been six months since
tens of millions of people

36
00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:42.476
suddenly disappeared.

37
00:01:42.477 --> 00:01:44.437
And as far as we're concerned.

38
00:01:44.438 --> 00:01:46.397
none of them have been seen since.

39
00:01:46.398 --> 00:01:48.524
So they hid from the truth. mostly.

40
00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:50.901
dreaming of any answer
they could think of.

41
00:01:50.902 --> 00:01:54.989
as long as it didn't involve
god. of course. solar flares.

42
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.200
secret weapons. little green men.

43
00:01:58.493 --> 00:02:01.245
Nothing was too crazy for a
world determined not to see

44
00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:02.496
the truth.

45
00:02:02.497 --> 00:02:04.915
And of course. one thing
you can always count on

46
00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:06.293
when disaster strikes.

47
00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:10.004
they're those whose first
thought is how to seize

48
00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:11.006
the opportunity.

49
00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:14.592
For Jonathan stonagal. well.
he seemed to have his plan

50
00:02:14.593 --> 00:02:16.260
in place before those empty clothes

51
00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:18.429
that even hit the ground.

52
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.474
Now you understand. Mr. Stonagal.

53
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.975
if it were up to me.

54
00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:25.103
I wouldn't be questioning any of this.

55
00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:29.650
Hmm. it is up to you. ed.

56
00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:32.026
all of it.

57
00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:34.570
The board can't interfere
with what I'm doing

58
00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:36.281
without unanimous consent.

59
00:02:38.367 --> 00:02:40.159
You're not here to tell me
that you're turning your back

60
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.328
on me now. are you. ed?

61
00:02:42.913 --> 00:02:46.457
I've turned hundreds into thousands.

62
00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:49.794
thousands into millions.
millions into billions.

63
00:02:49.795 --> 00:02:53.005
And still the bean counters
think that they know

64
00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:54.674
what's best.

65
00:02:54.675 --> 00:02:57.760
We're losing millions
of dollars every day now.

66
00:02:57.761 --> 00:03:02.766
with all of your new projects
and investments in Eden.

67
00:03:03.475 --> 00:03:06.143
the biggest social media
platform in history.

68
00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:09.563
buying up every media company
you get your hands on.

69
00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:11.816
You don't need to be
the only source of news

70
00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:13.526
and information.

71
00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:18.532
And now $400 million to build
a temple in the middle east.

72
00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.242
It's a nice temple.

73
00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:23.787
Sir. your two o'clock is here.

74
00:03:24.955 --> 00:03:27.665
- I suggest you go and give
serious thought as to what side

75
00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:29.501
of the table you wanna be sitting on.

76
00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:34.548
Something big is coming. Trust me.

77
00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:38.677
You wanna make sure
you're on the right team.

78
00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:43.889
- As people grapple with our new reality.

79
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.183
trying to accept the fact
that they may never see those

80
00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:47.977
missing loved ones again.

81
00:03:47.978 --> 00:03:50.020
Faith in our leaders is gone.

82
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:53.774
and frustration and anger
is at an all—time high.

83
00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:56.318
Not only have violent
crimes risen dramatically.

84
00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.029
but suicides are soaring outta control.

85
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.574
But according to mental health experts.

86
00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:03.909
there is an explanation
to what's going on.

87
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.703
We're gonna get into that with one of them

88
00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:07.663
right after the break.

89
00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:17.256
I have to admit.
I was never a big fan

90
00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:18.341
of rayford Steele.

91
00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:21.969
His wife. Irene. had
tried for years to get him

92
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.971
to join us at new hope.

93
00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:26.224
but I guess church just wasn't his thing.

94
00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:29.518
When she did manage to drag him there.

95
00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:31.687
he'd either read the
sports news on his phone

96
00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:34.148
or grab a quick nap thinking
everyone would believe

97
00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:35.149
he's praying.

98
00:04:40.197 --> 00:04:44.074
Irene had warned him about the
rapture over and over again.

99
00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:46.827
or at least that's how it seemed to him.

100
00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:48.788
The jfk control.
This is pen seven.

101
00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:51.165
We have an emergency. I repeat.

102
00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:53.542
We have an emergency.

103
00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:57.004
Jfk control. listen to
me. we've lost passengers.

104
00:04:57.005 --> 00:05:00.425
People literally disappeared
from the plane at 30.000 feet.

105
00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:05.721
So when half
the passengers on his

106
00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:08.474
trans—atlantic flight vanished that night.

107
00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:10.310
he knew right away what had happened.

108
00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:14.605
He may not have fully
understood what it meant.

109
00:05:14.606 --> 00:05:17.651
but Irene had told him what
would happen. and it did.

110
00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:43.009
And so at least ray
knew one thing for sure.

111
00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:47.680
He desperately wanted to
believe that Irene was right.

112
00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:49.891
- I miss you and ramey so much.

113
00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:53.435
It's been hard.

114
00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:59.359
Just keep thinking about
the things I said and did.

115
00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:04.614
whether you know how much I love you.

116
00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:09.369
I just wish I could see you one more time.

117
00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:12.414
but I know I can't.

118
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.002
Yeah. I know I can't.

119
00:06:21.882 --> 00:06:23.716
The world's obsession
with the vanishings

120
00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:24.884
is still in full force.

121
00:06:24.885 --> 00:06:28.846
And since we have no answers
from our supposed leaders.

122
00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:30.639
that's not really a surprise.

123
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.058
And while the immediate panic
and acute terror may have

124
00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:36.520
passed. I don't think anyone
can say that the world is not

125
00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:38.981
a completely different place now.

126
00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:41.775
In the past six months.
we've seen a dramatic.

127
00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:44.987
even shocking increase
in virtually every metric

128
00:06:44.988 --> 00:06:46.697
of human depravity.

129
00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:48.866
Compared to the same time last year.

130
00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:52.202
murders are up by more than 300%

131
00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:55.915
and suicides are up nearly 1000%.

132
00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:58.334
Violent crime. assault. rape. robbery.

133
00:06:58.335 --> 00:07:02.338
vandalism. looting. rioting.
they're all shattering records.

134
00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:04.256
And mental health experts
are telling us that

135
00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:06.216
the worst is yet to come.

136
00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:08.427
I have with me tonight. Dr. Ruby Kincaid.

137
00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:10.930
who is leading the
multinational investigation

138
00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:14.683
into what many are now
calling a pandemic of evil.

139
00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:17.019
Doctor. thank you so much for
being here with us tonight.

140
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.063
So. I guess we should just
get right to the heart of

141
00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:20.732
the matter. what's going on?

142
00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:23.692
In the case of the vanishings.

143
00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:27.613
there's simply no historical
knowledge to draw on.

144
00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:30.908
So people are triggered
into a prolonged fight

145
00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:33.035
or flight reaction.

146
00:07:33.036 --> 00:07:38.041
There is anger. fear.
mistrust. retaliation.

147
00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:43.004
Those are powerful emotions.
and they need an outlet.

148
00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:47.591
- So do you think world
leaders in our own government

149
00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:50.469
as well. should be doing
a betterjob at helping us

150
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.554
understand exactly what's happening?

151
00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:55.599
I mean. I know we have no
idea where those people went.

152
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.268
but telling everyone to stay at home.

153
00:07:58.269 --> 00:07:59.770
stop asking so many questions.

154
00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:02.648
I mean. that can't likely be helping.

155
00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:06.026
I think the root
cause is not the lack of

156
00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:10.739
clear information. but the
abundance of misinformation.

157
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.201
Our leaders need to do more
to stop people from coming up

158
00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:16.120
with conspiracy theories.

159
00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:18.539
- So. ignorance is bliss.

160
00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.709
Protecting people from dangerous ideas

161
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.585
isn't making them ignorant.

162
00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:27.047
We need to make it our
priority to keep people safe.

163
00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:30.426
Keep them safe from what exactly?

164
00:08:30.427 --> 00:08:32.345
Another wave of vanishings.

165
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:39.185
What? Hold on. a second
wave of vanishings.

166
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:42.646
Well. we have been
feeding all of the data

167
00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:45.107
we've managed to gather
about the vanishings

168
00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:46.775
into a database.

169
00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:50.779
We were then able to use
sophisticated computer algorithms

170
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.032
to create predictive models.

171
00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:55.576
And those models suggest
that a second wave

172
00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:59.204
is not only possible. it's almost certain.

173
00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:01.749
- So computers figured this out.

174
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:02.750
That's right.

175
00:09:03.585 --> 00:09:06.503
- Do you yourself personally.

176
00:09:06.504 --> 00:09:08.714
believe more people are gonna disappear

177
00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:11.508
or do you think that people
are just better off scared

178
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:14.595
right now. to keep them more compliant?

179
00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:16.805
I mean. we have a problem where people

180
00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:21.811
are so terrified and confused
that they're becoming violent

181
00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:23.353
and self-destructive.

182
00:09:23.354 --> 00:09:26.815
And you think coming on here
and scaring them even more

183
00:09:26.816 --> 00:09:28.650
is gonna somehow make things better?

184
00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:30.944
Are you saying that you know for a fact

185
00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:32.613
that it's not going to happen again?

186
00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:35.032
Not at all. Not at all.

187
00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:36.533
I have no idea.

188
00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:38.494
And I'm starting to
suspect that everybody.

189
00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:41.747
but at least I'm not sitting
here pretending like I do.

190
00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:44.458
I am talking about science here.

191
00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:47.836
And some of the world's top
scientists have studied the data

192
00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:49.296
very carefully and it's suggest-

193
00:09:49.297 --> 00:09:51.131
where did it come from?
— I'm sorry?

194
00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:52.716
The data.

195
00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:53.884
Where did it come from?

196
00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:57.763
All of the data has been
verified by the United Nations.

197
00:09:57.764 --> 00:10:00.516
It's all publicly available
in the UN's vanishing

198
00:10:00.517 --> 00:10:01.767
accountability project.

199
00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:05.979
I'm asking you. where did
they get their information from?

200
00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.731
- I just told you all of the
data has been verified by...

201
00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:08.608
Cut it now.

202
00:10:08.609 --> 00:10:10.067
Wrap it up.

203
00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:11.985
I'm sorry. but I guess
that is all the time we have

204
00:10:11.986 --> 00:10:12.862
for tonight.

205
00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:13.862
Thank you for coming on.

206
00:10:14.906 --> 00:10:17.699
But I do want to encourage our viewers.

207
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.701
keep demanding facts.

208
00:10:19.702 --> 00:10:23.080
Don't just blindly accept
whatever the so-called experts

209
00:10:23.081 --> 00:10:24.248
are telling us.

210
00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:25.791
And I wouldn't be too quick to sign up for

211
00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:27.293
a vanishings vaccine either.

212
00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:31.964
I'm Cameron Williams. Up
next is Victoria Jordan.

213
00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:33.006
We'll see you in a minute.

214
00:10:33.007 --> 00:10:34.508
And we are out.

215
00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:35.509
Who killed that?

216
00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:38.179
We were not out of time.

217
00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:42.183
Back to first
position. Live in four minutes.

218
00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:52.402
Wow. captain Steele.
it's good to see you.

219
00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:55.905
Ooh.

220
00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:56.781
Hmm?

221
00:10:56.782 --> 00:11:01.285
- Captain. you are aware
that we do not encourage

222
00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:02.619
unkempt hair for our pilots.

223
00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:03.620
Are you not?

224
00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:05.330
Unkempt? I just showered last week.

225
00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:08.584
- And these pants. those aren't
standard issue. are they?

226
00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:09.502
Oh. and the next time we meet.

227
00:11:09.503 --> 00:11:10.711
I wanna see a shine on those feet.

228
00:11:10.712 --> 00:11:12.588
I'll see what I can do.

229
00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:14.382
- You look great. dad.

230
00:11:15.425 --> 00:11:17.718
- Hey. and look. look it...

231
00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:19.429
At least is still fits.
— mm—hmm.

232
00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:25.309
- So are you thinking of
getting into the pilot seat?

233
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.102
Yeah. I was thinking maybe
I could do a couple runs

234
00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:30.564
for fedex. so I'm not
gone for days on end.

235
00:11:30.565 --> 00:11:35.445
I always hated being away so
much. from you and ram and mom.

236
00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:37.906
- Plus no passengers.

237
00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:43.161
- Yeah. plus no passengers.

238
00:11:45.788 --> 00:11:47.624
- Okay. captain.

239
00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:51.835
I'm hungry. Did you make me breakfast?

240
00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:52.961
- Did you make me breakfast?

241
00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:54.379
No. What do you mean
you're the ones up before me.

242
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.380
All right.

243
00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:58.342
Where's Ivy? — I'm right here.

244
00:11:58.343 --> 00:11:59.260
- I can't believe you changed the b roll

245
00:11:59.261 --> 00:12:00.261
without asking me first.

246
00:12:00.262 --> 00:12:02.429
I didn't touch it after you approved it.

247
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:03.931
I thought you were in the control room.

248
00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:05.308
I was. No one came in.

249
00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:07.726
Connor.

250
00:12:08.895 --> 00:12:10.646
Don't get connorfired. He's just a kid.

251
00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:12.522
You think I'm mad at
Connor? What's he gonna do?

252
00:12:12.523 --> 00:12:13.690
Say no to plank?

253
00:12:13.691 --> 00:12:14.567
I would have.

254
00:12:14.568 --> 00:12:15.984
Yeah. well. sure that's
why I didn't ask you.

255
00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:17.736
Or maybe it's because
there's only one guy here

256
00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:19.655
that knows how to swap the
footage in the live broadcast

257
00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:21.698
without setting foot of the control room.

258
00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:23.533
Did you really think I
would change your b roll

259
00:12:23.534 --> 00:12:25.410
in a live show without your approval?

260
00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:26.411
- Of course not.

261
00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:29.790
Buck's relentless
reporting brought gwn

262
00:12:29.791 --> 00:12:31.792
it's highest ratings ever.

263
00:12:31.793 --> 00:12:32.669
- Seriously?

264
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:35.379
But it seemed the closer
he got to the truth.

265
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.548
the more his own network pushed back.

266
00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:40.050
Mr. Williams. I'm so sorry.

267
00:12:40.051 --> 00:12:41.843
Ivy had no idea that the b
roll was gonna be changed.

268
00:12:41.844 --> 00:12:43.303
Connor. it's fine.

269
00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:44.972
I'm sure you weren't really
in a position to argue

270
00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:46.057
with Mr. Plank. right?

271
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.810
Thank you for understanding sir.

272
00:12:49.686 --> 00:12:51.144
Plank. — be gentle.

273
00:12:51.145 --> 00:12:52.689
You know me better than that.

274
00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.858
Okay. Steve. I know you have
shareholders to appease.

275
00:12:56.859 --> 00:13:00.153
but I have a contract and
a pretty good one at that.

276
00:13:00.154 --> 00:13:00.989
And?

277
00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:03.573
And it means I don't have
to give primetime exposure

278
00:13:03.574 --> 00:13:06.243
to crackpot conspiracy theorists like her.

279
00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:07.995
- You're a reporter buck.

280
00:13:07.996 --> 00:13:10.747
Sometimes that means going
outside of your comfort zone

281
00:13:10.748 --> 00:13:14.419
and interviewing people that
you don't always agree with.

282
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:19.631
I'm happy to talk to anybody
with a newsworthy story.

283
00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:23.218
It was fear mongering
plank. plain and simple.

284
00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:27.931
Computers. computers say
more people are gonna vanish.

285
00:13:27.932 --> 00:13:30.100
Well. maybe she should spend
her time trying to find people

286
00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:31.311
who already disappeared.

287
00:13:32.353 --> 00:13:33.895
- Are you done?

288
00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:36.065
What was up with that
b roll horror show?

289
00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:39.401
I thought you'd be pleased.

290
00:13:39.402 --> 00:13:42.654
I had our editors and the new kid

291
00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:46.783
dig up something a
little more sensational.

292
00:13:46.784 --> 00:13:48.702
- Sensational?

293
00:13:48.703 --> 00:13:52.247
Plank. you showed a video of
terrified and desperate people

294
00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:54.124
jumping off of buildings.

295
00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:55.334
That's not sensational.

296
00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:57.377
It's just sick. And using Connor.

297
00:13:57.378 --> 00:13:59.379
I mean. the kid's only
been here a few months.

298
00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.089
You're already teaching
'em the art of fake news.

299
00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.342
- Come on. wake up. buck.

300
00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:05.344
Our military and our
police were decimated with

301
00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:06.970
the vanishings.

302
00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:08.972
Scared people stay in their homes.

303
00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:11.350
They lock themselves inside.

304
00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:13.393
And that's what we need right now.

305
00:14:13.394 --> 00:14:15.604
Don't you think that
locking people in their homes

306
00:14:15.605 --> 00:14:17.898
is gonna add to the problem?

307
00:14:17.899 --> 00:14:19.483
We grieve by sharing.

308
00:14:19.484 --> 00:14:21.485
We have a lot of people that
need to deal with the fact that

309
00:14:21.486 --> 00:14:23.153
they lost everything that matters.

310
00:14:23.154 --> 00:14:24.781
Their wives. their...

311
00:14:26.824 --> 00:14:27.991
Yes. Erica.

312
00:14:27.992 --> 00:14:30.160
- Did you see the UN story?

313
00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:31.745
They're pushing for the Romanian president

314
00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:33.622
to be the new secretary general.

315
00:14:33.623 --> 00:14:34.623
- Carpathia.

316
00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:37.125
And so?

317
00:14:37.126 --> 00:14:40.462
- So it's just strange. He
didn't even ask to be appointed.

318
00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:43.382
Did they overtake the UN by force?

319
00:14:43.383 --> 00:14:45.300
- No. he hasn't even made a statement.

320
00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:46.843
Well. then it's not news.

321
00:14:46.844 --> 00:14:50.139
So please go out and find me some news.

322
00:14:57.146 --> 00:15:01.441
The last thing we need right
now are the streets overrun

323
00:15:01.442 --> 00:15:05.112
with unstable and
potentially violent people.

324
00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:07.781
So until the authorities
can get their arms.

325
00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:11.159
their fat arms around this thing.

326
00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.580
it is our duty to do what we can.

327
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.917
If you think that somehow
it's your civic duty

328
00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:21.796
to terrify people. I can't stop you.

329
00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:25.383
but it's the last time you're
gonna do it on my show.

330
00:15:26.342 --> 00:15:29.594
Oh. well then maybe it's time to think

331
00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:32.014
about canceling your show.

332
00:15:35.893 --> 00:15:38.563
Yeah. I think we both know
that's not gonna happen.

333
00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:43.400
Try me.

334
00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:08.049
It seems that
Chloe Steele spent most of

335
00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:09.759
her time haunted.

336
00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.220
tortured by the memory
of her little brother.

337
00:16:12.221 --> 00:16:14.974
vanishing right from her
arms as she hugged him.

338
00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:18.852
How could she have done
things differently?

339
00:16:18.853 --> 00:16:22.190
How could she have saved
him from whatever it was?

340
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:27.195
She was terrified that
he was lost forever.

341
00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:31.407
and that somehow it was her fault.

342
00:16:33.868 --> 00:16:35.243
It has always been my position

343
00:16:35.244 --> 00:16:37.662
we should take advantage of every crisis

344
00:16:37.663 --> 00:16:39.456
to make the world a better place.

345
00:16:39.457 --> 00:16:42.918
With each disaster. storm
or war comes the opportunity

346
00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:45.880
for all of us to do better.

347
00:16:46.839 --> 00:16:48.298
As our climate gets hotter.

348
00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:50.967
as we become more interconnected.

349
00:16:50.968 --> 00:16:53.094
as pandemics race across the globe.

350
00:16:53.095 --> 00:16:55.096
Something is coming.

351
00:16:55.097 --> 00:16:58.309
Some crisis will strike all of us.

352
00:16:59.435 --> 00:17:02.687
and we should welcome
whatever it is with open arms.

353
00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:06.066
Because only then will the
world finally come together

354
00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:09.277
and create a truly global union.

355
00:17:09.278 --> 00:17:14.283
a single world government
founded on peace and unity.

356
00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:28.046
Buck. what's going on?

357
00:17:28.047 --> 00:17:30.215
Hey. remember that guy
davos last year talking

358
00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:33.760
about opportunity and catastrophe?

359
00:17:33.761 --> 00:17:35.262
Well. that
was almost all of them.

360
00:17:35.263 --> 00:17:37.931
True. Well. this guy's name's cothran.

361
00:17:37.932 --> 00:17:40.809
He owns dominator analytics.
and I think he may be-

362
00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.978
whoa. whoa. whoa. let's
not do this over the phone.

363
00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:45.605
Let's just say it's a rabbit hole.

364
00:17:45.606 --> 00:17:48.483
- I do love a good rabbit
hole. I'm on my way.

365
00:18:38.367 --> 00:18:40.952
Please help me. Where did he go?

366
00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:42.330
Please let me in.

367
00:18:44.415 --> 00:18:45.498
Let me in.

368
00:18:45.499 --> 00:18:47.710
Hey. wake up.

369
00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:54.133
Are you okay?

370
00:18:56.093 --> 00:18:57.511
Yeah. I'm fine.

371
00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:01.599
That must been quite a dream.

372
00:19:06.187 --> 00:19:08.188
It was just really real.

373
00:19:08.189 --> 00:19:09.564
You know. like it was like a nightmare

374
00:19:09.565 --> 00:19:14.320
but it's like I was
losing him all over again.

375
00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:19.324
Oh. we all have different
ways of dealing with things

376
00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:20.576
that we don't understand.

377
00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:27.249
but I think it's time
to focus on the future.

378
00:19:28.459 --> 00:19:33.088
And as hard as it is. we
have to stop looking back.

379
00:19:33.089 --> 00:19:35.091
Well then where am I supposed to look?

380
00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:37.592
Because back is where we lost them.

381
00:19:37.593 --> 00:19:38.803
I know. I know.

382
00:19:40.096 --> 00:19:43.557
You're not the only one who
needs to find a new approach.

383
00:19:44.892 --> 00:19:47.103
I mean. we have both
been hiding for too long.

384
00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:54.985
Mom and ramey. they're counting
on us to do the right thing.

385
00:19:55.986 --> 00:19:58.029
You mean they were counting on us?

386
00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:59.240
No. No.

387
00:20:00.324 --> 00:20:02.827
I mean. they are counting on us.

388
00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.621
And what makes you so sure?

389
00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:10.000
- Because mom told us.

390
00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:16.006
- Okay. But because mom said so?

391
00:20:17.007 --> 00:20:18.801
That didn't even work when I was 12.

392
00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:23.389
Besides. mom's rapture theory
has already been proven wrong.

393
00:20:24.432 --> 00:20:29.018
- So do you think mom was
stupid or just gullible?

394
00:20:29.019 --> 00:20:30.354
What? I never said that.

395
00:20:31.689 --> 00:20:36.401
Then don't you think that
we owe her the courtesy

396
00:20:36.402 --> 00:20:38.778
of considering the fact that she told us

397
00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:40.156
it was going to happen?

398
00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:44.034
Sure. it was easy to dismiss
it before it happened.

399
00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:49.289
But doesn't it seem strange
that it's still so easy

400
00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:50.750
to dismiss it now?

401
00:20:52.835 --> 00:20:56.213
Even though we saw it with our own eyes?

402
00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:24.533
Enter.

403
00:21:28.954 --> 00:21:31.247
I thought you were gonna
at least try to stop acting

404
00:21:31.248 --> 00:21:32.832
like a crazy conspiracy theorist.

405
00:21:32.833 --> 00:21:35.418
Whoa. Who are you calling
a conspiracy theorist?

406
00:21:35.419 --> 00:21:37.212
- Oh. so you're just
admitting to being crazy?

407
00:21:37.213 --> 00:21:39.131
- Yes. I'm quite comfortable with that.

408
00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:41.216
Shut the door.

409
00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:44.302
Here.

410
00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:48.515
So cothran and his dominator analytics

411
00:21:48.516 --> 00:21:50.350
provides virtually all the raw data.

412
00:21:50.351 --> 00:21:51.976
the UN compiles all of it.

413
00:21:51.977 --> 00:21:54.062
Surveys. research studies. polls.

414
00:21:54.063 --> 00:21:56.856
These guys do it all. And
they've got the market cornered.

415
00:21:56.857 --> 00:21:59.150
- So you're saying they can
just stand up and tell the world

416
00:21:59.151 --> 00:22:01.152
anything they want and
they'd be able to back it up

417
00:22:01.153 --> 00:22:02.362
with fake stats?

418
00:22:02.363 --> 00:22:03.239
Yep.

419
00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.114
What about the vanishings?

420
00:22:05.115 --> 00:22:07.033
All those reports about
the earth's total mass.

421
00:22:07.034 --> 00:22:08.284
not changing that day.

422
00:22:08.285 --> 00:22:11.704
Statistics about how many people
disappeared. who they were.

423
00:22:11.705 --> 00:22:13.206
how they might have been
different from the rest of us

424
00:22:13.207 --> 00:22:14.582
those? — yep.

425
00:22:14.583 --> 00:22:16.417
All of it came through dominator.

426
00:22:16.418 --> 00:22:17.961
Wow.

427
00:22:17.962 --> 00:22:20.713
Well. at least we know
what cothran's agenda is.

428
00:22:20.714 --> 00:22:22.674
He's a crisis to get us to accept changes

429
00:22:22.675 --> 00:22:24.050
that we wouldn't have othennise.

430
00:22:24.051 --> 00:22:26.261
When you have complete control
over the narrative like that

431
00:22:26.262 --> 00:22:28.972
guy does. I mean. you can
turn anything into a crisis.

432
00:22:28.973 --> 00:22:30.348
That's all true.

433
00:22:30.349 --> 00:22:32.183
But cothran's not the
guy calling the shots.

434
00:22:32.184 --> 00:22:34.352
He's just another suit.

435
00:22:34.353 --> 00:22:35.813
- So who's calling the shots?

436
00:22:42.486 --> 00:22:45.281
- These are interconnected corporations.

437
00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:50.410
15 television networks.
120 individual stations.

438
00:22:50.411 --> 00:22:52.328
Almost 300 newspapers.

439
00:22:52.329 --> 00:22:53.955
Remember. newspapers?

440
00:22:53.956 --> 00:22:57.166
Let's see. two Hollywood film studios.

441
00:22:57.167 --> 00:23:00.378
14 of the top 20 magazines.
believe it or not.

442
00:23:00.379 --> 00:23:03.631
the two biggest pharmaceutical
companies in the world.

443
00:23:03.632 --> 00:23:05.259
That's how we got rich off covid.

444
00:23:06.302 --> 00:23:08.428
Here's one you might find interesting.

445
00:23:08.429 --> 00:23:09.762
He's your boss.

446
00:23:09.763 --> 00:23:11.180
Gwn? No. that's not right.

447
00:23:11.181 --> 00:23:13.099
Gwn's owned by the dornan family.

448
00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.144
No. Oh. have you ever met the dornans?

449
00:23:16.145 --> 00:23:16.979
No.

450
00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.480
- That's because there is
no dornan family. never was.

451
00:23:19.481 --> 00:23:22.025
Jack dornan. never married.
didn't have a family.

452
00:23:22.026 --> 00:23:23.735
He's been dead for 30 years.

453
00:23:23.736 --> 00:23:27.447
All of these companies are
owned directly or indirectly

454
00:23:27.448 --> 00:23:31.159
by one man. Jonathan stonagal.

455
00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.619
Like the Eden guy.

456
00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:33.704
- One and the same.

457
00:23:34.747 --> 00:23:36.915
He's been pushing something
called the great reset

458
00:23:36.916 --> 00:23:40.920
for years. a true new
world order globalist.

459
00:23:41.921 --> 00:23:44.255
I wouldn't have a hard time
getting this message out.

460
00:23:44.256 --> 00:23:45.132
I mean. what?

461
00:23:45.133 --> 00:23:46.841
Eden alone already has 5 billion users?

462
00:23:46.842 --> 00:23:49.302
- Nope. six and a half now.
- — geeze.

463
00:23:49.303 --> 00:23:51.638
What's amazing is that
he tripled his wealth

464
00:23:51.639 --> 00:23:53.139
during the covid pandemic.

465
00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:56.268
and he tripled it again in the
aftermath of the vanishings.

466
00:23:57.144 --> 00:23:58.144
Let's go.

467
00:24:04.902 --> 00:24:06.819
So where were you?

468
00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:07.696
- Sorry?

469
00:24:07.697 --> 00:24:09.906
Where were you when it happened?

470
00:24:09.907 --> 00:24:13.242
Oh. I was in a plane.
halfway across the Atlantic.

471
00:24:13.243 --> 00:24:15.244
Ah. I was right.

472
00:24:15.245 --> 00:24:16.205
- About what?

473
00:24:16.206 --> 00:24:18.046
That you would have a
cooler story than I do.

474
00:24:18.958 --> 00:24:23.586
Yeah. Best and worst day of my life.

475
00:24:23.587 --> 00:24:24.755
- Way outta your league.

476
00:24:25.673 --> 00:24:27.298
Never let a crisis go to waste. right?

477
00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:28.299
Yeah.

478
00:24:28.969 --> 00:24:32.136
- So tell me. did her boyfriend disappear?

479
00:24:32.137 --> 00:24:34.389
What? How brave do you think I am?

480
00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:36.307
No. we didn't disappear.

481
00:24:36.308 --> 00:24:37.851
He was hit by a driverless bus.

482
00:24:39.436 --> 00:24:40.436
- And |'|| say.

483
00:24:45.651 --> 00:24:47.778
Oh. here. hold this and keep an eye out.

484
00:24:48.946 --> 00:24:51.322
Oh. it's heavy. Made of lead?

485
00:24:51.323 --> 00:24:54.784
- Not made of. no. but coated with.

486
00:24:54.785 --> 00:24:55.910
The feds have devices

487
00:24:55.911 --> 00:24:57.495
that can download your entire hard drive

488
00:24:57.496 --> 00:24:58.496
from 10 feet away.

489
00:24:59.623 --> 00:25:01.332
- You ever heard of a safe?

490
00:25:01.333 --> 00:25:03.960
Yeah. It's in the office filing cabinet.

491
00:25:03.961 --> 00:25:06.004
bolted to the floor.

492
00:25:06.005 --> 00:25:07.005
Let's go.

493
00:25:10.676 --> 00:25:12.552
And one day I'm gonna stumble
into the wrong minefield

494
00:25:12.553 --> 00:25:14.012
and the feds are gonna clean up my office.

495
00:25:14.013 --> 00:25:15.972
including the safe.

496
00:25:15.973 --> 00:25:17.098
What are they gonna find?

497
00:25:17.099 --> 00:25:19.100
Hard drive full of encrypted files.

498
00:25:19.101 --> 00:25:20.268
And if they keep at it long enough.

499
00:25:20.269 --> 00:25:22.478
they'll crack the encryption
and get the grand prize.

500
00:25:22.479 --> 00:25:24.105
Which is what?

501
00:25:24.106 --> 00:25:26.274
- 30 seasons of "the Simpsons".

502
00:25:26.275 --> 00:25:27.817
That's gonna tick them off.

503
00:25:27.818 --> 00:25:29.445
Oh. maybe not. It's blu-ray.

504
00:25:50.049 --> 00:25:52.133
Chloe couldn't
help but wonder if her dad

505
00:25:52.134 --> 00:25:53.134
was right.

506
00:25:54.303 --> 00:25:56.929
What if mom and ramey were
lost because of something

507
00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:57.931
in that book?

508
00:25:58.766 --> 00:26:01.476
All she could do was wish
her mom had never opened

509
00:26:01.477 --> 00:26:04.104
that stupid Bible in the first place.

510
00:26:26.919 --> 00:26:29.171
Buck and Chloe met on
the day of the rapture.

511
00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:33.424
Buck had been a passenger on
that flight piloted by ray.

512
00:26:33.425 --> 00:26:35.843
Many romantics would say it
was fate that brought buck

513
00:26:35.844 --> 00:26:37.053
and Chloe together.

514
00:26:37.054 --> 00:26:37.930
- Oh. heck yes.

515
00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:38.889
But I now know that there was

516
00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:40.807
a far greater force at work.

517
00:26:40.808 --> 00:26:42.225
They needed to be together.

518
00:26:42.226 --> 00:26:43.102
Thank you.

519
00:26:43.103 --> 00:26:44.477
God had a plan.

520
00:26:44.478 --> 00:26:46.521
I know it's not just about plank though.

521
00:26:46.522 --> 00:26:49.107
It's whole network.
whole business. really?

522
00:26:49.108 --> 00:26:51.192
I honestly don't even
want to do it anymore.

523
00:26:51.193 --> 00:26:52.194
Are you kidding?

524
00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:56.781
You have the biggest
audience in cable news.

525
00:26:56.782 --> 00:26:58.741
Yeah. Well. that would be
a good thing if I didn't have

526
00:26:58.742 --> 00:27:00.911
to put air quotes around the word news.

527
00:27:02.496 --> 00:27:04.206
- Hey. look. look at these people.

528
00:27:05.332 --> 00:27:08.417
They know who you are. They trust you.

529
00:27:08.418 --> 00:27:10.294
They trust you. even if
they've never met you.

530
00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:12.338
- See. that's the problem.

531
00:27:12.339 --> 00:27:14.924
They trust me to tell them the truth.

532
00:27:14.925 --> 00:27:18.803
The news. it's no longer about
truth. It's about a message.

533
00:27:18.804 --> 00:27:21.889
And facts don't even matter anymore.

534
00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:24.851
I go on that show every
single night and lie to them

535
00:27:24.852 --> 00:27:27.396
as if we're too afraid they
can't handle the truth.

536
00:27:29.189 --> 00:27:30.315
Hi. — hey. Yeah.

537
00:27:32.442 --> 00:27:34.403
Great.

538
00:27:37.698 --> 00:27:38.949
I used to love my job.

539
00:27:40.159 --> 00:27:43.995
I was an investigative
journalist for 10 years.

540
00:27:43.996 --> 00:27:45.538
You know what I did?

541
00:27:45.539 --> 00:27:48.583
I investigated things that
needed to be investigated.

542
00:27:48.584 --> 00:27:52.254
and then I actually told
people about what I found.

543
00:27:57.885 --> 00:27:58.885
And now?

544
00:27:59.803 --> 00:28:01.596
Now I'm more like an actor.

545
00:28:01.597 --> 00:28:03.097
I do my lines

546
00:28:03.098 --> 00:28:06.142
and depending on whatever
story we decide to report.

547
00:28:06.143 --> 00:28:10.646
I try to convince the
world that things are way.

548
00:28:10.647 --> 00:28:13.984
way better or far. far worse
than they actually are.

549
00:28:16.028 --> 00:28:18.197
I just feel like my audience
is smarter than that.

550
00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:21.532
They're not a bunch of religious wackos

551
00:28:21.533 --> 00:28:23.743
who are only looking for easy answers

552
00:28:23.744 --> 00:28:27.455
and don't require facts or two
seconds of their own thought.

553
00:28:27.456 --> 00:28:28.873
Wackos like my mom?

554
00:28:28.874 --> 00:28:31.918
- Chloe. no. I didn't mean that.

555
00:28:31.919 --> 00:28:33.336
I'm trying to process every...

556
00:28:37.799 --> 00:28:38.717
Are you seeing this?

557
00:28:38.718 --> 00:28:42.178
Oh. dear. I can't believe it.

558
00:28:42.179 --> 00:28:43.512
- Second wave.

559
00:28:43.513 --> 00:28:44.513
Here we go.

560
00:28:47.059 --> 00:28:48.852
I think I need to get to the studio.

561
00:28:51.104 --> 00:28:53.397
Are you okay? — yeah.

562
00:28:53.398 --> 00:28:55.067
Okay. I'll call you later.

563
00:28:58.737 --> 00:29:01.864
Although there are plenty of
rumors and Internet chatter.

564
00:29:01.865 --> 00:29:04.784
tracking down eyewitnesses
has actually been harder

565
00:29:04.785 --> 00:29:06.035
than we expected.

566
00:29:06.036 --> 00:29:09.497
One notable witness was
apparently senator Arthur Brandon.

567
00:29:09.498 --> 00:29:11.832
But while he has issued a statement.

568
00:29:11.833 --> 00:29:14.835
he has so far been unwilling
to speak to the media.

569
00:29:14.836 --> 00:29:18.005
In fact. we've been having a
hard time tracking down anyone

570
00:29:18.006 --> 00:29:20.591
who's actually witnessed a new vanishing.

571
00:29:20.592 --> 00:29:23.135
It's like everybody knows
there was a second wave.

572
00:29:23.136 --> 00:29:26.013
but nobody's actually seen it happen.

573
00:29:26.014 --> 00:29:29.183
So. Anna. while we wait
for our coverage of

574
00:29:29.184 --> 00:29:32.270
the UN press conference. what
do you think about all this?

575
00:29:32.271 --> 00:29:35.940
I believe him. He's a
senator and he's a good man.

576
00:29:35.941 --> 00:29:37.775
Why would one of our
own government officials

577
00:29:37.776 --> 00:29:39.318
make something like that up?

578
00:29:39.319 --> 00:29:42.154
Just to scare us? It's ridiculous.

579
00:29:42.155 --> 00:29:43.364
Well. just like last time. I mean.

580
00:29:43.365 --> 00:29:45.741
there weren't any reports
of unusual activity

581
00:29:45.742 --> 00:29:47.243
in the skies or around the earth's orbit.

582
00:29:47.244 --> 00:29:50.413
So are you still sticking
with the ufo theory?

583
00:29:50.414 --> 00:29:51.706
- Of course.

584
00:29:51.707 --> 00:29:53.124
What else could have
done something like this?

585
00:29:53.125 --> 00:29:55.668
Many of the scientists
I spoke to seem to

586
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:58.587
think that this is not the
first time these vanishings

587
00:29:58.588 --> 00:30:00.089
have happened on this planet.

588
00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:02.800
Certainly the first
time any of us noticed.

589
00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:05.052
We're talking millions of years ago.

590
00:30:05.053 --> 00:30:07.930
long before people were recording history.

591
00:30:07.931 --> 00:30:10.182
In fact. it's probably
why there are gaping holes

592
00:30:10.183 --> 00:30:12.101
in the fossil records showing the totality

593
00:30:12.102 --> 00:30:13.144
of human evolution.

594
00:30:13.145 --> 00:30:15.604
Well. maybe the ufos
have been here many times.

595
00:30:15.605 --> 00:30:17.023
And then why has nobody seen them?

596
00:30:17.024 --> 00:30:18.858
- You just said there
was no one here to report

597
00:30:18.859 --> 00:30:20.151
the visits millions of years ago.

598
00:30:20.152 --> 00:30:22.862
Okay. reverend pinkus.
what do you think?

599
00:30:22.863 --> 00:30:25.781
I mean. you originally
stated that the vanishings

600
00:30:25.782 --> 00:30:27.575
were the Christian rapture.

601
00:30:27.576 --> 00:30:29.410
I mean. is that still right?

602
00:30:29.411 --> 00:30:32.288
That's true. It was
actually a bit scary.

603
00:30:32.289 --> 00:30:33.998
But so many christians are still here.

604
00:30:33.999 --> 00:30:35.791
including hundreds from my own church.

605
00:30:35.792 --> 00:30:39.045
that there's no way that it
could have been the rapture.

606
00:30:39.046 --> 00:30:41.213
Now that doesn't mean that
god didn't have his hand

607
00:30:41.214 --> 00:30:42.840
in it. though.

608
00:30:42.841 --> 00:30:45.426
the Bible does teach that god will send

609
00:30:45.427 --> 00:30:47.887
a powerful delusion in the last days.

610
00:30:47.888 --> 00:30:50.765
And I personally believe that
this whole vanishing thing

611
00:30:50.766 --> 00:30:52.059
is part of that.

612
00:30:53.226 --> 00:30:55.269
Well. let's all try our best not to add

613
00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:56.396
to those delusions.

614
00:30:57.439 --> 00:30:58.689
- What about you. buck?

615
00:30:58.690 --> 00:30:59.690
What do you think?

616
00:31:01.068 --> 00:31:02.985
Well. the way I see it.

617
00:31:02.986 --> 00:31:06.781
there's only one explanation
that doesn't require an appeal

618
00:31:06.782 --> 00:31:11.202
to an imaginary power or unseen force.

619
00:31:11.203 --> 00:31:12.746
That's simply a new technology.

620
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:16.123
I mean. you'd think we'd
stop being so surprised

621
00:31:16.124 --> 00:31:20.294
at what the human race is capable
of creating at this point.

622
00:31:20.295 --> 00:31:23.339
We all watch people disappear
on "Star Trek" growing up.

623
00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:26.258
communicators. translators.
androids. robots.

624
00:31:26.259 --> 00:31:27.760
they're all realities now.

625
00:31:27.761 --> 00:31:30.096
So why not the transporter beam?

626
00:31:30.097 --> 00:31:32.348
- So you're saying this
is a man-made weapon.

627
00:31:32.349 --> 00:31:35.267
I never said it was a
weapon. I said technology.

628
00:31:35.268 --> 00:31:39.313
Arthur c. Clarke once said
that any sufficiently advanced

629
00:31:39.314 --> 00:31:42.109
technology is
indistinguishable from magic.

630
00:31:43.151 --> 00:31:45.820
What I take away from that
is we don't need to look

631
00:31:45.821 --> 00:31:47.571
for magic just because we don't understand

632
00:31:47.572 --> 00:31:48.949
how something works.

633
00:31:51.827 --> 00:31:53.744
I just got report that
we are about to begin

634
00:31:53.745 --> 00:31:55.705
our coverage of the UN press conference.

635
00:31:57.249 --> 00:31:58.749
Less than a year ago.

636
00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:00.584
if someone had told me
that millions of people

637
00:32:00.585 --> 00:32:03.421
were just gonna disappear.
I. like you would've said

638
00:32:03.422 --> 00:32:04.548
they were crazy.

639
00:32:06.258 --> 00:32:10.846
Fast foward to today and the
unimaginable has become real.

640
00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:13.222
And with the news at the vanishings.

641
00:32:13.223 --> 00:32:15.516
we're not simply a one—time event.

642
00:32:15.517 --> 00:32:18.519
We should all be reminded
that we have no choice

643
00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:22.481
but to face this
unprecedented threat together.

644
00:32:22.482 --> 00:32:25.025
Not as individual nation
states divided by rivers

645
00:32:25.026 --> 00:32:28.779
or mountains. or
thousands of years of war.

646
00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.365
but as one people united at last.

647
00:32:36.705 --> 00:32:40.667
Fellow citizens of the
world. welcome to the future.

648
00:32:41.626 --> 00:32:44.128
welcome to a new reality.

649
00:32:44.129 --> 00:32:48.090
a great reset where we move
from a tribal mentality

650
00:32:48.091 --> 00:32:50.801
to a united and unstoppable force

651
00:32:50.802 --> 00:32:52.344
ready to face any challenge.

652
00:32:52.345 --> 00:32:55.097
Because there is no greater
power in the universe

653
00:32:55.098 --> 00:32:57.308
than a unified human race.

654
00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:03.522
You already know. the
second wave of vanishings.

655
00:33:03.523 --> 00:33:05.734
even though the extent is not yet known.

656
00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:09.820
has thrown the financial
markets back into chaos.

657
00:33:09.821 --> 00:33:12.616
And while the major stock
exchanges quickly closed.

658
00:33:13.575 --> 00:33:16.118
the losses were already
catastrophic from panic selling

659
00:33:16.119 --> 00:33:19.413
in every country in the world.

660
00:33:19.414 --> 00:33:22.625
The world monetary fund has
also issued a formal warning

661
00:33:22.626 --> 00:33:26.086
that more than 100 countries
will likely be bankrupt

662
00:33:26.087 --> 00:33:27.796
within 60 days.

663
00:33:27.797 --> 00:33:31.884
And within a year. more than
90% of the world's citizens

664
00:33:31.885 --> 00:33:33.345
will be living in poverty.

665
00:33:34.596 --> 00:33:37.264
Fortunately. we have a solution.

666
00:33:38.433 --> 00:33:40.643
And there it
was. a surreal moment

667
00:33:40.644 --> 00:33:42.228
to say the least.

668
00:33:42.229 --> 00:33:45.105
one of the most powerful men
on the planet standing in front

669
00:33:45.106 --> 00:33:48.025
of the world and promising
a one world economy.

670
00:33:48.026 --> 00:33:51.987
a one world currency. and the
path to peace and prosperity.

671
00:33:51.988 --> 00:33:55.241
exactly the system the
Bible told us was coming.

672
00:33:55.242 --> 00:33:57.493
And unsurprisingly. the people.

673
00:33:57.494 --> 00:34:00.746
and especially the news
media. 'just gobbled it up.

674
00:34:00.747 --> 00:34:02.706
- Today under emergency conditions.

675
00:34:02.707 --> 00:34:05.459
and with a nearly unanimous consent.

676
00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:08.879
the United Nations has
voted to approve and mandate

677
00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:12.174
the electronic payment
technology known as otm.

678
00:34:12.175 --> 00:34:14.760
created by Israeli nobel prize winner.

679
00:34:14.761 --> 00:34:16.304
Dr. Chaim rosensweig.

680
00:34:17.305 --> 00:34:20.140
Now. the reason I'm part of
this announcement is that Eden.

681
00:34:20.141 --> 00:34:23.227
the largest social media platform ever.

682
00:34:23.228 --> 00:34:26.772
has agreed to make all our
resources available to the UN

683
00:34:26.773 --> 00:34:30.192
free of charge in order to
ensure that we can implement

684
00:34:30.193 --> 00:34:33.279
Eden pay worldwide in a matter of weeks.

685
00:34:37.742 --> 00:34:40.995
Let me introduce the
inventor on the Mark digital

686
00:34:40.996 --> 00:34:44.583
technologies. Dr. Chaim rosensweig.

687
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:47.668
Buck. you'll
be the first interview.

688
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:52.674
- Cue graphic ready studio in 3. 2. 1.

689
00:34:52.716 --> 00:34:53.757
Dr. Rosensweig.

690
00:34:53.758 --> 00:34:55.301
So good to see you again.

691
00:34:55.302 --> 00:34:58.178
Mr. Stonagal. thank you so
much for taking the time

692
00:34:58.179 --> 00:34:59.805
to be with us tonight.

693
00:34:59.806 --> 00:35:03.976
Now. this is a lot bigger
news than I think most people

694
00:35:03.977 --> 00:35:05.144
actually realize.

695
00:35:05.145 --> 00:35:06.687
I mean. Mr. Stonagal.

696
00:35:06.688 --> 00:35:09.064
you must have jumped through
a lot of hoops to get this

697
00:35:09.065 --> 00:35:11.233
to where it is at the UN. correct?

698
00:35:11.234 --> 00:35:13.527
Well. there are some very smart people

699
00:35:13.528 --> 00:35:15.613
in extremely powerful
positions around the world.

700
00:35:15.614 --> 00:35:18.574
and they see the need and
wisely recognized Eden pay

701
00:35:18.575 --> 00:35:19.659
as the best solution.

702
00:35:20.619 --> 00:35:24.705
Now. you said that you had
essentially unanimous support

703
00:35:24.706 --> 00:35:25.874
from the UN membership.

704
00:35:26.833 --> 00:35:28.876
Can I assume that essentially unanimous

705
00:35:28.877 --> 00:35:31.295
is different from unanimous?

706
00:35:31.296 --> 00:35:32.838
Well. a few of the
members have questions.

707
00:35:32.839 --> 00:35:34.340
but that's to be expected.

708
00:35:34.341 --> 00:35:36.884
Fortunately. none that we can't answer.

709
00:35:36.885 --> 00:35:39.261
Do you mind telling
us who the holdouts are?

710
00:35:39.262 --> 00:35:41.805
All nations have formally
agreed with two exceptions.

711
00:35:41.806 --> 00:35:43.266
Romania and Israel.

712
00:35:44.184 --> 00:35:45.184
Interesting.

713
00:35:46.186 --> 00:35:49.605
Dr. Rosensweig. I'm a
little confused by that.

714
00:35:49.606 --> 00:35:51.398
Why would Israel be holding out?

715
00:35:51.399 --> 00:35:54.818
I mean. isn't Eden built
on Israeli technology?

716
00:35:54.819 --> 00:35:56.528
- Israel has not signed the agreement yet

717
00:35:56.529 --> 00:35:59.823
because there are deal
terms to be negotiated.

718
00:35:59.824 --> 00:36:01.617
Are those financial terms?

719
00:36:01.618 --> 00:36:03.410
Oh. no. no. nothing of that sort.

720
00:36:03.411 --> 00:36:05.245
There are other issues involved.

721
00:36:05.246 --> 00:36:07.665
including ongoing peace talks.

722
00:36:07.666 --> 00:36:11.126
We want to ensure that Eden
ushers in an era of peace

723
00:36:11.127 --> 00:36:14.380
for Israel and indeed
for the entire world.

724
00:36:14.381 --> 00:36:18.008
- So we actually have
peace in the middle east

725
00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:19.009
as a deal term.

726
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:21.470
Wow.

727
00:36:23.264 --> 00:36:28.018
No. no. no way.

728
00:36:28.019 --> 00:36:30.980
Could you just get the victim
to come on camera and...

729
00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:36.068
No. Alright. then we'll go
with the fake Jesus guy.

730
00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:37.361
Make sure you get him on camera.

731
00:36:37.362 --> 00:36:39.405
Taking credit for the new vanishings.

732
00:36:39.406 --> 00:36:41.115
Look. I gotta go.

733
00:36:41.116 --> 00:36:43.325
I gotta walk the dog. What's it to you?

734
00:36:43.326 --> 00:36:44.326
Good bye.

735
00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:49.206
Tough day at the ministry of truth.

736
00:36:49.207 --> 00:36:51.417
Can't you tell that I'm not in the mood?

737
00:36:51.418 --> 00:36:52.918
I hate to be the one to
break it to you. Steve.

738
00:36:52.919 --> 00:36:54.879
but you always look like that.

739
00:36:55.755 --> 00:36:58.590
So to recap.

740
00:36:58.591 --> 00:37:01.927
two days after I have
a guest come on my show

741
00:37:01.928 --> 00:37:05.055
and predict a second wave of vanishings.

742
00:37:05.056 --> 00:37:07.141
we have a second wave of vanishings.

743
00:37:07.142 --> 00:37:08.225
It wasn't a prediction.

744
00:37:08.226 --> 00:37:10.979
She was simply reporting
what the model said.

745
00:37:11.896 --> 00:37:14.982
- Computers spit out data.
- People make predictions.

746
00:37:14.983 --> 00:37:16.567
Anyways. long story short.

747
00:37:16.568 --> 00:37:19.236
I decided to look into her
claims a little more carefully

748
00:37:19.237 --> 00:37:21.196
like I would've done before the show

749
00:37:21.197 --> 00:37:23.407
had I actually known that
you were gonna have her on.

750
00:37:23.408 --> 00:37:26.535
Thank you for that. by the
way. she's an interesting lady.

751
00:37:26.536 --> 00:37:27.619
I'll give you that.

752
00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:30.873
She works closely with a man
named Joshua Todd-cothran.

753
00:37:30.874 --> 00:37:33.417
who I've actually heard give his message

754
00:37:33.418 --> 00:37:37.212
on how he wants to
introduce a new world order.

755
00:37:37.213 --> 00:37:39.548
These people are obsessed
with the idea of having

756
00:37:39.549 --> 00:37:43.302
a one world government that
somehow will solve all poverty

757
00:37:43.303 --> 00:37:44.179
and wars.

758
00:37:44.179 --> 00:37:45.179
How dare they.

759
00:37:45.972 --> 00:37:49.057
The road to hell is paved
with good intentions. Steve.

760
00:37:49.058 --> 00:37:53.020
So their plan for several
years now has been to create

761
00:37:53.021 --> 00:37:55.898
an infrastructure for global order by.

762
00:37:55.899 --> 00:37:57.441
this is the important part.

763
00:37:57.442 --> 00:37:59.526
by waiting for a global catastrophe.

764
00:37:59.527 --> 00:38:01.737
And then they're gonna use
all the fear and uncertainty

765
00:38:01.738 --> 00:38:03.906
in the world to get
people to accept changes

766
00:38:03.907 --> 00:38:06.492
they never would've
accepted before the crisis.

767
00:38:06.493 --> 00:38:09.703
There's nothing new there.
and it certainly isn't news.

768
00:38:09.704 --> 00:38:11.497
Okay. well. I'm not finished yet either.

769
00:38:11.498 --> 00:38:14.917
Then I have Dr. Kincaid come on my show

770
00:38:14.918 --> 00:38:16.460
and says she has computer models

771
00:38:16.461 --> 00:38:19.505
that are pointing towards
a second wave of vanishing.

772
00:38:19.506 --> 00:38:22.466
- So she was right. I guess
you owe her an apology.

773
00:38:22.467 --> 00:38:24.343
- Yeah. you would think so.

774
00:38:24.344 --> 00:38:27.846
Except I'm not entirely convinced

775
00:38:27.847 --> 00:38:29.516
anyone vanished this time around.

776
00:38:30.475 --> 00:38:32.935
You see. I was able to
find the source of the data

777
00:38:32.936 --> 00:38:35.229
that was used to make that prediction.

778
00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:38.148
90% of it came from one firm.

779
00:38:38.149 --> 00:38:42.236
dominator analytics owned
by Joshua Todd-cothran.

780
00:38:42.237 --> 00:38:44.947
So we have a guy who
thinks we need to scare

781
00:38:44.948 --> 00:38:46.156
the hell outta people.

782
00:38:46.157 --> 00:38:48.742
Now. scaring the hell outta people.

783
00:38:48.743 --> 00:38:50.077
- Buck. you don't have facts.

784
00:38:50.078 --> 00:38:52.037
You're spitballing.

785
00:38:52.038 --> 00:38:53.580
- He's not alone.

786
00:38:53.581 --> 00:38:56.918
He's got a partner. Jonathan stonagal.

787
00:38:58.419 --> 00:38:59.419
Yeah.

788
00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:03.048
So these guys. whose fundamental mandate

789
00:39:03.049 --> 00:39:05.342
is to terrify people.

790
00:39:05.343 --> 00:39:08.053
not only announce a second wave in advance

791
00:39:08.054 --> 00:39:10.472
and then use their own
stats to back it up.

792
00:39:10.473 --> 00:39:12.224
but are now telling us that
they're gonna take over

793
00:39:12.225 --> 00:39:15.060
the world bank and we
don't have a choice except

794
00:39:15.061 --> 00:39:17.521
to just go with it.

795
00:39:17.522 --> 00:39:18.897
Bottom line.

796
00:39:18.898 --> 00:39:21.900
I think these new vanishing
counts that we so proudly

797
00:39:21.901 --> 00:39:25.028
display on all the screens
during every broadcast

798
00:39:25.029 --> 00:39:26.364
are probably fake.

799
00:39:32.287 --> 00:39:33.495
Is that it?

800
00:39:33.496 --> 00:39:36.748
- Nope. definitely not. I
haven't even started digging yet.

801
00:39:36.749 --> 00:39:38.042
And you're not going to.

802
00:39:38.918 --> 00:39:42.546
Look. I know you've got
your beloved fan base.

803
00:39:42.547 --> 00:39:44.256
Yeah. give him something to chew on.

804
00:39:44.257 --> 00:39:46.049
But you say it every day of the week.

805
00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:48.886
We are not in the conspiracy business.

806
00:39:48.887 --> 00:39:51.096
Okay. plank. this isn't a conspiracy.

807
00:39:51.097 --> 00:39:52.931
This is the biggest news story

808
00:39:52.932 --> 00:39:54.308
since the vanishings themselves.

809
00:39:54.309 --> 00:39:56.101
No. no. that is not the big news story.

810
00:39:56.102 --> 00:39:58.395
The big news story is that
the world is suffering

811
00:39:58.396 --> 00:40:01.940
and we are teetering on
the brink of mass insanity.

812
00:40:01.941 --> 00:40:04.568
You start questioning the
facts. the only facts.

813
00:40:04.569 --> 00:40:07.029
the few facts that we actually have

814
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:08.781
and you just make everything worse.

815
00:40:10.158 --> 00:40:11.992
Okay plank. listen to me.

816
00:40:11.993 --> 00:40:13.703
No. you listen to me.

817
00:40:14.746 --> 00:40:18.081
You drag this line of
nonsense into the public eye.

818
00:40:18.082 --> 00:40:21.044
you and I were both finished
in the news business forever.

819
00:40:22.629 --> 00:40:23.879
I don't wanna hear another word on this.

820
00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:26.673
You don't share any of it with the staff.

821
00:40:26.674 --> 00:40:29.052
This conversation is over. Are we clear?

822
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:31.971
You're wrong about this one.

823
00:40:34.641 --> 00:40:36.058
Are we clear?

824
00:41:32.573 --> 00:41:33.741
- Oh. finally.

825
00:41:49.632 --> 00:41:50.967
Oh. come on. This is crazy.

826
00:42:06.566 --> 00:42:08.108
I'm glad ray didn't find what

827
00:42:08.109 --> 00:42:10.111
he was looking for on Irene's phone.

828
00:42:11.029 --> 00:42:14.031
God's hand was on him and
he ended up right where

829
00:42:14.032 --> 00:42:15.033
he needed to be.

830
00:42:23.708 --> 00:42:25.542
Jesus told us in the last days

831
00:42:25.543 --> 00:42:27.420
the world would hate christians.

832
00:42:30.006 --> 00:42:32.466
The first rocks through
the window at new hope

833
00:42:32.467 --> 00:42:34.969
came only about an hour after the rapture.

834
00:42:46.939 --> 00:42:49.566
So why do people who
don't even believe in god

835
00:42:49.567 --> 00:42:51.736
suddenly hate him so much?

836
00:42:56.574 --> 00:42:59.493
Because they have no
one else to blame it on.

837
00:44:34.463 --> 00:44:35.463
Hello?

838
00:45:02.742 --> 00:45:05.953
Sometimes the
hate exploded into violence.

839
00:45:08.539 --> 00:45:11.500
And you know what? Maybe I deserved it.

840
00:45:13.836 --> 00:45:16.129
If ray hadn't shown up that day.

841
00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:18.757
who knows if I would've found my way.

842
00:45:18.758 --> 00:45:19.592
Pastor Barnes.

843
00:45:19.593 --> 00:45:21.885
I may have given up on god.

844
00:45:21.886 --> 00:45:26.765
but I'm humbled to know that
god hadn't given up on me.

845
00:45:26.766 --> 00:45:28.601
How's it going. ray?

846
00:46:50.057 --> 00:46:52.559
But even in total darkness.

847
00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.937
god can find a way to light the path.

848
00:46:56.522 --> 00:46:58.274
Even with the faintest glint.

849
00:47:21.756 --> 00:47:23.966
It's uh. the only thing I can find.

850
00:47:25.509 --> 00:47:26.509
Thanks.

851
00:47:29.138 --> 00:47:30.680
What happened here?

852
00:47:30.681 --> 00:47:32.599
Bunch of hooligans.

853
00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:34.477
Who can blame them? They're scared.

854
00:47:36.437 --> 00:47:39.064
- So you okay?

855
00:47:39.065 --> 00:47:41.567
Yeah. it's just my job.

856
00:47:44.487 --> 00:47:46.446
To what do I owe this pleasure.

857
00:47:46.447 --> 00:47:49.033
It's not like you've ever
been a big fan of this place.

858
00:47:50.368 --> 00:47:53.411
Shouldn't I be the one who
surprised to see you here?

859
00:47:53.412 --> 00:47:54.412
- I suppose so.

860
00:47:58.125 --> 00:47:59.251
What is it ray?

861
00:48:03.172 --> 00:48:04.924
Was it the rapture?

862
00:48:06.342 --> 00:48:08.551
Yes. Yes it was.

863
00:48:08.552 --> 00:48:09.928
- Are you sure?

864
00:48:09.929 --> 00:48:11.763
You really sure?

865
00:48:11.764 --> 00:48:13.599
You know what finally convinced me?

866
00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:17.019
When I saw it happen.

867
00:48:20.064 --> 00:48:23.608
- So. Irene and Raymond.

868
00:48:23.609 --> 00:48:26.445
They're fine. ray. they're
in heaven for eternity.

869
00:48:31.033 --> 00:48:32.534
- — But then.
- Go ahead. ray.

870
00:48:32.535 --> 00:48:34.035
You can ask.

871
00:48:34.036 --> 00:48:36.037
Why are you still here?

872
00:48:36.038 --> 00:48:38.624
- Because I asked god to leave me behind.

873
00:48:39.875 --> 00:48:42.335
I'm not done living my life down here.

874
00:48:42.336 --> 00:48:43.963
So I didn't wanna leave too soon.

875
00:48:45.714 --> 00:48:47.133
Is that good enough for you?

876
00:48:49.927 --> 00:48:51.429
It would be if it were true.

877
00:49:06.861 --> 00:49:08.987
Chloe? — hi. Dr. Wright.

878
00:49:08.988 --> 00:49:12.031
I just.

879
00:49:12.032 --> 00:49:13.867
What? Oh my. Oh goodness.

880
00:49:13.868 --> 00:49:15.910
What happened to you? Come inside.

881
00:49:15.911 --> 00:49:16.911
Thank you.

882
00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:19.039
- Come on upstairs.

883
00:49:21.792 --> 00:49:26.129
Well. this looks pretty angry.
but it's fairly shallow.

884
00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:28.590
No stitches required.

885
00:49:28.591 --> 00:49:31.718
I'll just give it a good
rinse and apply some topical

886
00:49:31.719 --> 00:49:35.055
antibiotic. which should
also help with the pain.

887
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:40.102
Thanks. Dr. Wright.
— oh. Amanda.

888
00:49:44.106 --> 00:49:45.107
Hi. fern.

889
00:49:46.775 --> 00:49:49.027
Chloe. this is fern.

890
00:49:49.028 --> 00:49:51.822
Fern. this is Irene's daughter. Chloe.

891
00:49:56.827 --> 00:50:01.414
Honey. I'm on borrowed time.
so I'm just gonna say it.

892
00:50:01.415 --> 00:50:02.917
You messed up big.

893
00:50:14.803 --> 00:50:16.930
Ray wanted
to talk about prophecy

894
00:50:16.931 --> 00:50:18.098
and who could blame him?

895
00:50:19.725 --> 00:50:22.143
His wife told him the
rapture was going to happen

896
00:50:22.144 --> 00:50:23.144
and it did.

897
00:50:23.145 --> 00:50:24.688
So of course he was curious.

898
00:50:27.525 --> 00:50:29.317
Me on the other hand.

899
00:50:29.318 --> 00:50:31.611
I guess I was just still
pouting and feeling sorry

900
00:50:31.612 --> 00:50:32.612
for myself.

901
00:50:34.281 --> 00:50:37.450
But ray managed to drag me
into his little Bible study

902
00:50:37.451 --> 00:50:40.662
with what he would later admit
was an intentional mistake.

903
00:50:40.663 --> 00:50:42.997
Seven. — huh?

904
00:50:42.998 --> 00:50:45.083
It's not six years. it's seven.

905
00:50:45.084 --> 00:50:46.084
- Oh.

906
00:50:47.169 --> 00:50:50.338
Tribulation doesn't start
when the rapture happens.

907
00:50:50.339 --> 00:50:53.007
The seven year clock doesn't
start counting down until

908
00:50:53.008 --> 00:50:55.802
there's a sign of a seven
year peace agreement

909
00:50:55.803 --> 00:50:58.055
between Israel and her enemies.

910
00:51:00.516 --> 00:51:02.892
And you know what else
you find out on that day?

911
00:51:02.893 --> 00:51:06.146
What? — who the antichrist is.

912
00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:11.234
He's the one that confirms the treaty

913
00:51:11.235 --> 00:51:13.862
until then his identity
is anybody's guess.

914
00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:19.784
So then who is this
antichrist? I mean. is it Satan?

915
00:51:19.785 --> 00:51:24.455
Not exactly. The antichrist
is Satan's counterfeit Jesus.

916
00:51:24.456 --> 00:51:26.874
He's sent here to lie and deceive.

917
00:51:26.875 --> 00:51:29.919
He'll say one thing and
then he'll—— you know what

918
00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:32.589
forget it. I can't do this.

919
00:51:32.590 --> 00:51:34.215
- What do you mean?

920
00:51:34.216 --> 00:51:37.386
Who am I to tell you what to believe?

921
00:51:38.887 --> 00:51:40.306
But you know this stuff.

922
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:43.308
I never believed it.

923
00:51:43.309 --> 00:51:44.184
None of it.

924
00:51:44.185 --> 00:51:46.312
I talked about god all the time

925
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:51.190
'cause I was just one
of those false teachers

926
00:51:51.191 --> 00:51:54.111
that the Bible says that will
show up in the last days.

927
00:51:55.195 --> 00:51:57.030
We both made mistakes. Bruce.

928
00:51:57.031 --> 00:51:58.532
So how about we unmake them?

929
00:52:03.746 --> 00:52:08.167
Look. I think we both believe this now.

930
00:52:09.543 --> 00:52:11.753
We missed our chance.
but so did everyone else

931
00:52:11.754 --> 00:52:13.504
who's still here.

932
00:52:13.505 --> 00:52:15.882
They need to know the truth.

933
00:52:15.883 --> 00:52:17.051
- Look around.

934
00:52:18.010 --> 00:52:21.888
No one comes here. No
one's been here in months.

935
00:52:21.889 --> 00:52:23.891
They don't want the truth.

936
00:52:25.601 --> 00:52:26.602
- One of them might.

937
00:52:30.606 --> 00:52:31.690
That should be enough.

938
00:52:34.276 --> 00:52:35.276
You're right.

939
00:52:43.827 --> 00:52:44.828
Start with this.

940
00:52:46.121 --> 00:52:48.873
Hello. my name is Vernon billings

941
00:52:48.874 --> 00:52:52.001
and I'm the lead pastor
at new hope church.

942
00:52:52.002 --> 00:52:55.838
I'm recording this as a message
for all those left behind

943
00:52:55.839 --> 00:52:57.965
after the return of Christ in the air

944
00:52:57.966 --> 00:53:00.761
to call his church home in the rapture.

945
00:53:01.845 --> 00:53:05.056
For all of you who lost
loved ones among the millions

946
00:53:05.057 --> 00:53:09.977
that vanished. please be
assured they are fine.

947
00:53:09.978 --> 00:53:12.689
You have my word on that.

948
00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:14.774
Are you trying to scare me?

949
00:53:14.775 --> 00:53:15.817
Perhaps. Chloe.

950
00:53:15.818 --> 00:53:17.610
Perhaps Chloe what?

951
00:53:17.611 --> 00:53:20.363
Needs everything sugar coated for her?

952
00:53:20.364 --> 00:53:23.449
I think that's what got her
here in the first place.

953
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:25.536
- — I'm sorry.
- You should be.

954
00:53:26.745 --> 00:53:30.373
Don't you act all tough
with me. Chloe Steele.

955
00:53:30.374 --> 00:53:34.127
I had a mama who worshiped the drink

956
00:53:34.128 --> 00:53:38.005
and turfed me out on the street at 12.

957
00:53:38.006 --> 00:53:39.716
Okay. what exactly did I do?

958
00:53:39.717 --> 00:53:42.511
Do? Oh. I'm so glad
you asked that question.

959
00:53:43.345 --> 00:53:47.098
Your mom was a friend of mine
and she made it her mission

960
00:53:47.099 --> 00:53:50.601
to ensure that we all know
the answer to the question

961
00:53:50.602 --> 00:53:52.271
that everybody's asking now.

962
00:53:53.397 --> 00:53:55.398
I just never thought I would see

963
00:53:55.399 --> 00:53:59.778
the daughter of Irene Steele left behind.

964
00:54:01.029 --> 00:54:02.029
- I see.

965
00:54:05.409 --> 00:54:08.245
So if you both listened to my mom

966
00:54:10.038 --> 00:54:11.415
and why are you still here?

967
00:54:12.916 --> 00:54:17.921
Oh. child! You in it now.

968
00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:23.843
The apostle Paul wrote
to the church at corinth.

969
00:54:23.844 --> 00:54:27.555
Behold. I tell you a mystery.

970
00:54:27.556 --> 00:54:29.599
We shall not all sleep.

971
00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:34.605
but shall be changed in a moment
in the twinkling of an eye.

972
00:54:36.607 --> 00:54:40.693
Unfortunately. if you are
watching this after the rapture.

973
00:54:40.694 --> 00:54:45.699
then you are either in or soon
to be in a seven year period

974
00:54:45.824 --> 00:54:47.700
of darkness. tribulation.

975
00:54:47.701 --> 00:54:50.662
and terror like the world has never seen.

976
00:54:52.039 --> 00:54:55.291
Please. I beg you.

977
00:54:55.292 --> 00:54:58.711
abandon your self-centered ideals.

978
00:54:58.712 --> 00:55:03.674
No matter what you have to face
on earth. it's not too late.

979
00:55:03.675 --> 00:55:06.386
You can still spend eternity in heaven.

980
00:55:08.847 --> 00:55:12.767
turn to the Bible. turn to god.

981
00:55:12.768 --> 00:55:15.895
Not because you have no other choice.

982
00:55:15.896 --> 00:55:18.440
but because this is the right choice.

983
00:55:20.025 --> 00:55:22.944
Turn to god. I beg you.

984
00:55:22.945 --> 00:55:26.323
Take this opportunity
and embrace these words.

985
00:55:27.282 --> 00:55:28.367
Get on your knees

986
00:55:29.409 --> 00:55:31.578
and thank god for this second chance.

987
00:55:41.046 --> 00:55:43.005
Ray knew that
studying Bible prophecy

988
00:55:43.006 --> 00:55:44.298
was not enough.

989
00:55:44.299 --> 00:55:46.467
Heck. I was living proof of that.

990
00:55:46.468 --> 00:55:48.719
I knew that stuff inside out.

991
00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:50.763
I could have written a
book about the rapture.

992
00:55:50.764 --> 00:55:52.723
and yet there I was.

993
00:55:52.724 --> 00:55:56.143
The gift of salvation is
free. You can't earn it.

994
00:55:56.144 --> 00:55:57.728
You can't deserve it.

995
00:55:57.729 --> 00:56:00.940
You just have to ask and receive.

996
00:56:00.941 --> 00:56:03.192
I'd have laughed if you
told me that one day.

997
00:56:03.193 --> 00:56:06.196
rayford steel would be
leading me to the altar.

998
00:56:07.239 --> 00:56:08.657
Thank you. Jesus.

999
00:56:12.995 --> 00:56:15.162
I want you to repeat these words

1000
00:56:15.163 --> 00:56:18.792
and to think about each
word as you say it.

1001
00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:23.129
Lord Jesus. I know I am a sinner.

1002
00:56:23.130 --> 00:56:26.048
Lord Jesus. know I'm a sinner.

1003
00:56:26.049 --> 00:56:28.968
But I also know that you have offered me

1004
00:56:28.969 --> 00:56:32.096
the gift of your forgiveness.

1005
00:56:32.097 --> 00:56:34.432
But I also know you've offered me

1006
00:56:34.433 --> 00:56:35.766
the gift of your forgiveness.

1007
00:56:35.767 --> 00:56:37.394
- You gave your life for me.

1008
00:56:38.228 --> 00:56:40.980
and then Rose from the
dead on the third day.

1009
00:56:40.981 --> 00:56:43.107
You gave your life for me.

1010
00:56:43.108 --> 00:56:45.610
and then Rose from the
dead on the third day.

1011
00:56:45.611 --> 00:56:49.656
I gratefully accept
your offer of salvation.

1012
00:56:50.741 --> 00:56:53.868
I gratefully accept
your offer of salvation.

1013
00:56:53.869 --> 00:56:58.874
- Please. lord. come into my
heart as my lord and savior.

1014
00:56:59.333 --> 00:57:02.376
Please. lord. come
into my heart as my lord

1015
00:57:02.377 --> 00:57:03.377
and savior.

1016
00:57:05.088 --> 00:57:09.009
- Thank you Jesus. Amen.

1017
00:57:13.138 --> 00:57:14.138
Amen.

1018
00:57:15.807 --> 00:57:16.974
Well. what about the main server?

1019
00:57:16.975 --> 00:57:18.017
Any luck?

1020
00:57:18.018 --> 00:57:20.770
No way. Not without password.

1021
00:57:20.771 --> 00:57:22.189
Well. keep trying anyway.

1022
00:57:25.943 --> 00:57:27.736
Come on. Come on. come on.

1023
00:57:29.655 --> 00:57:30.655
Ah—huh.

1024
00:57:43.293 --> 00:57:44.670
- Hey. Chloe. where are you?

1025
00:57:46.546 --> 00:57:48.507
I didn't even know that
place was still running.

1026
00:57:49.841 --> 00:57:51.468
Oh. no. no. I'm fine. I'm fine.

1027
00:57:53.053 --> 00:57:55.471
I just wanted to talk to about something.

1028
00:57:55.472 --> 00:57:58.099
I know you might not be ready for this.

1029
00:57:58.100 --> 00:57:59.684
but I saw something today

1030
00:57:59.685 --> 00:58:02.437
and I really want you to see it too.

1031
00:58:04.272 --> 00:58:05.774
Well. what if it is about god?

1032
00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:07.650
I mean. what does-

1033
00:58:08.443 --> 00:58:09.736
Chloe. please?

1034
00:58:14.116 --> 00:58:15.158
Okay. Yeah. Fine.

1035
00:58:17.202 --> 00:58:18.328
I'll call you tomorrow.

1036
00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:21.123
Yeah. I love you too.

1037
00:58:24.876 --> 00:58:27.587
Don't you think your dad
would wanna know you got hurt?

1038
00:58:29.089 --> 00:58:31.799
- I need a doctor. not a priest.

1039
00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:34.970
Girl. you need to honor thy father.

1040
00:59:23.894 --> 00:59:25.061
Okay. What is this?

1041
00:59:25.062 --> 00:59:26.520
What do you want?

1042
00:59:58.595 --> 01:00:01.389
Yes.

1043
01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:10.147
- Hi. ray.

1044
01:00:10.148 --> 01:00:11.441
Hattie. — how are you?

1045
01:00:14.402 --> 01:00:15.402
I'm good.

1046
01:00:17.656 --> 01:00:20.074
So. please. I'm sorry.

1047
01:00:20.075 --> 01:00:21.535
Why don't you come on inside.

1048
01:00:22.994 --> 01:00:25.162
I'm so glad to see that you're all right.

1049
01:00:25.163 --> 01:00:27.039
Oh yeah. I mean. I'm
better than all right.

1050
01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.624
It's been good.

1051
01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:30.043
Oh yeah.

1052
01:00:31.878 --> 01:00:33.754
- Just really wanted to see you.

1053
01:00:33.755 --> 01:00:34.964
I've been thinking so much about you

1054
01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:36.757
and I've been thinking about us.

1055
01:00:36.758 --> 01:00:38.551
Yeah. I meant to call but...

1056
01:00:38.552 --> 01:00:40.345
It's okay. You don't owe me an apology.

1057
01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:43.722
- Can I get you a drink or something?

1058
01:00:43.723 --> 01:00:45.224
I would love one. thanks.

1059
01:00:45.225 --> 01:00:46.934
What can I get you?

1060
01:00:46.935 --> 01:00:48.186
Whatever you're having.

1061
01:00:50.105 --> 01:00:51.106
I left the airline.

1062
01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:55.151
Really? To do what?

1063
01:00:55.152 --> 01:00:56.861
- I got a job at the UN.

1064
01:00:56.862 --> 01:00:58.863
I'm gonna be working with
the Romanian ambassador.

1065
01:00:58.864 --> 01:01:00.823
nicolae carpathia.

1066
01:01:00.824 --> 01:01:03.742
Wow. I mean. that sounds great.

1067
01:01:03.743 --> 01:01:06.120
I mean. it could be
great for both of us.

1068
01:01:06.121 --> 01:01:08.539
The UN is having trouble getting
negotiators and diplomatic

1069
01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:11.001
teams out fast enough. and
they're short on pilots.

1070
01:01:11.918 --> 01:01:13.753
- Oh. Oh.

1071
01:01:15.088 --> 01:01:16.922
I'm not looking for a job. but thanks.

1072
01:01:16.923 --> 01:01:18.716
- Seriously. I mean.
they're paying so well.

1073
01:01:18.717 --> 01:01:21.051
you'll help the world
get back on its feet.

1074
01:01:21.052 --> 01:01:22.845
I mean. not to mention you'll
have an amazing coworker

1075
01:01:22.846 --> 01:01:24.472
with a lot of benefits.

1076
01:01:25.932 --> 01:01:30.270
Hattie. I can't.

1077
01:01:39.362 --> 01:01:42.281
You gotta stop living in the past. ray.

1078
01:01:42.282 --> 01:01:44.658
you have to stop worrying
about the vanishings.

1079
01:01:44.659 --> 01:01:46.202
Those weren't vanishings.

1080
01:01:46.203 --> 01:01:48.704
It was a rapture. just like
I told you on the plane

1081
01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:49.539
the night that it happened.

1082
01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:50.540
It wasn't the rapture.

1083
01:01:50.541 --> 01:01:53.083
The rapture was debunked on the first day.

1084
01:01:53.084 --> 01:01:55.253
And there's been more
vanishings since then.

1085
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:58.964
- Do you know anyone who's
gone in the second wave?

1086
01:01:58.965 --> 01:02:00.341
Not personally.

1087
01:02:00.342 --> 01:02:02.635
- It's because the
raptures weren't debunked

1088
01:02:02.636 --> 01:02:04.970
but someone on TV told you
that they were debunked

1089
01:02:04.971 --> 01:02:07.474
and you just accepted it.

1090
01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:13.688
What almost happened between us?

1091
01:02:15.857 --> 01:02:17.983
It doesn't matter now.

1092
01:02:17.984 --> 01:02:19.568
Well. did I ever matter?

1093
01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:21.695
That that's not what I meant.

1094
01:02:21.696 --> 01:02:25.491
Hattie. I've accepted Jesus
Christ as my lord and savior.

1095
01:02:25.492 --> 01:02:26.909
And please trust me on this.

1096
01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:28.787
You cannot find the truth without him.

1097
01:02:33.959 --> 01:02:36.877
I really should have
suspected that you'd take

1098
01:02:36.878 --> 01:02:37.963
the coward's way out.

1099
01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:40.965
You didn't feel guilty
when your wife was here.

1100
01:02:40.966 --> 01:02:42.716
but now you feel guilty that she's gone.

1101
01:02:42.717 --> 01:02:44.301
And so you're running
to god for forgiveness.

1102
01:02:44.302 --> 01:02:46.846
And I mean. who cares who you
hurt along the way. right?

1103
01:02:48.556 --> 01:02:53.561
If I hurt you. I'm sorry. I really am.

1104
01:02:54.688 --> 01:02:57.273
But accepting Christ is not cowardly.

1105
01:02:57.274 --> 01:03:00.276
It's far from it.

1106
01:03:00.277 --> 01:03:01.319
What was cowardly?

1107
01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:04.196
It was being too afraid of the truth

1108
01:03:04.197 --> 01:03:06.449
to even want to hear it.

1109
01:03:18.712 --> 01:03:19.712
- Goodbye. ray.

1110
01:03:35.437 --> 01:03:36.937
Hey. — I got in.

1111
01:03:36.938 --> 01:03:40.399
- Seriously?
- — yeah. And it's insane.

1112
01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.277
I mean. it's gonna take some
time. but this thing is huge.

1113
01:03:43.278 --> 01:03:44.945
I mean. the biggest single
program I've ever seen.

1114
01:03:44.946 --> 01:03:46.989
maybe a hundred million lines of code.

1115
01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:48.282
So what are you saying?

1116
01:03:48.283 --> 01:03:50.409
I'm saying that this is more
than some kind of electronic

1117
01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:51.744
pay app.

1118
01:03:51.745 --> 01:03:52.953
How'd you get in?

1119
01:03:52.954 --> 01:03:54.288
- Let's just say someone on the inside

1120
01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:56.457
thinks the world needs to see this.

1121
01:03:56.458 --> 01:03:57.458
And so do you.

1122
01:04:07.594 --> 01:04:08.844
Well. Megan. as you can see.

1123
01:04:08.845 --> 01:04:11.180
this place is going absolutely crazy.

1124
01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:13.766
As we anticipate the
arrival of united nation's

1125
01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:16.518
peace spin on nicolae carpathia.

1126
01:04:16.519 --> 01:04:18.645
This is the kind of reception
you might have expected

1127
01:04:18.646 --> 01:04:21.190
for a movie star. but for a politician.

1128
01:04:21.191 --> 01:04:24.151
I haven't seen anything
like this since Obama.

1129
01:04:24.152 --> 01:04:26.070
I mean. listen to that crowd

1130
01:04:26.071 --> 01:04:27.821
after all the incredible work he did

1131
01:04:27.822 --> 01:04:29.656
in Romania after the vanishings.

1132
01:04:29.657 --> 01:04:31.658
the world is looking for
someone they can trust

1133
01:04:31.659 --> 01:04:33.577
to get us all back on track.

1134
01:04:33.578 --> 01:04:35.287
And I'm not sure there's
been a world leader

1135
01:04:35.288 --> 01:04:37.956
who has earned that
trust more than this man.

1136
01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:44.464
- Anyone see you come in.

1137
01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:47.758
I took the stairs. What'd you find?

1138
01:04:47.759 --> 01:04:50.469
I gotta look inside
the Eden pay platform.

1139
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:53.138
And it's a whole lot more
than a glorified bank card.

1140
01:04:53.139 --> 01:04:55.724
In fact. the whole
financial part is maybe 10%.

1141
01:04:55.725 --> 01:04:56.975
What's the rest of it?

1142
01:04:56.976 --> 01:04:58.894
Combination of things.

1143
01:04:58.895 --> 01:05:03.858
Surveillance. tracking. biometric
reporting. social credit.

1144
01:05:04.818 --> 01:05:07.236
I mean. they may be planning
to start with the money.

1145
01:05:07.237 --> 01:05:09.071
but whoever has control over this system

1146
01:05:09.072 --> 01:05:11.365
has control over the whole
world and everyone in it.

1147
01:05:11.366 --> 01:05:13.575
- Well. you said social credit.

1148
01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:15.494
which means they're gonna
force you to either conform

1149
01:05:15.495 --> 01:05:16.662
or be kicked out of the system.

1150
01:05:16.663 --> 01:05:19.164
Yeah. and if you lose
access to Eden pay.

1151
01:05:19.165 --> 01:05:20.625
then you can't even buy food.

1152
01:05:21.584 --> 01:05:23.627
And you're gonna pretend
like it's not mandatory.

1153
01:05:23.628 --> 01:05:25.504
Act like we actually have a choice.

1154
01:05:25.505 --> 01:05:27.673
Download the app or starve to death.

1155
01:05:27.674 --> 01:05:29.550
Pretty powerful marketing campaign.

1156
01:05:29.551 --> 01:05:32.719
Yeah. my guy on the inside
says he has the smoking gun

1157
01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.721
that connects all this
and a whole lot more

1158
01:05:34.722 --> 01:05:38.725
directly to stonagal. and
he's willing to hand it over.

1159
01:05:38.726 --> 01:05:39.726
- Do you trust him?

1160
01:05:41.229 --> 01:05:43.105
- He says. I have to agree to
make the whole thing public.

1161
01:05:43.106 --> 01:05:45.858
He even wants to do a
media interview to document

1162
01:05:45.859 --> 01:05:46.734
the evidence.

1163
01:05:46.735 --> 01:05:49.028
So. it seems like he's on our team.

1164
01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:51.656
Well. he's our only lead.

1165
01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:53.950
I say we go for it.

1166
01:05:55.827 --> 01:05:57.411
I don't think you should go.

1167
01:05:57.412 --> 01:05:58.662
No? — think about it.

1168
01:05:58.663 --> 01:06:01.540
If this is the FBI or CIA or whatever.

1169
01:06:01.541 --> 01:06:04.001
if this is a setup for my hacking.

1170
01:06:04.002 --> 01:06:04.836
then they've got both of us

1171
01:06:04.837 --> 01:06:06.379
and the story dies right there.

1172
01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:09.131
Let me go.

1173
01:06:10.758 --> 01:06:12.217
I'll bring a cameraman.

1174
01:06:12.218 --> 01:06:15.179
We'll tape the interview
and then you run it.

1175
01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:17.055
What if you get arrested?

1176
01:06:17.056 --> 01:06:19.516
Well. then you still have all this.

1177
01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:20.934
Hopefully. it'll still
be enough to blow the lid

1178
01:06:20.935 --> 01:06:22.020
off the Eden hoax.

1179
01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:25.607
- Okay. Yeah. let's do it.

1180
01:06:36.451 --> 01:06:37.285
Where is he?

1181
01:06:37.286 --> 01:06:38.952
- Closed door meeting since I got in.

1182
01:06:38.953 --> 01:06:40.704
haven't heard him yell once.

1183
01:06:40.705 --> 01:06:41.705
Something's up.

1184
01:06:42.582 --> 01:06:43.874
Getty images went with the one

1185
01:06:43.875 --> 01:06:45.959
where I'm interviewing carpathia.

1186
01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:47.212
It's going global.

1187
01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:51.131
I swear she's trying to take my job.

1188
01:06:51.132 --> 01:06:52.466
Obviously.

1189
01:06:52.467 --> 01:06:55.010
- Okay. so I found a
treasure trove of evidence

1190
01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:55.887
to Bury this guy.

1191
01:06:55.888 --> 01:06:58.430
And I mean. I'm talking
atomic level bombshells here.

1192
01:06:58.431 --> 01:07:00.432
Ooh. Gimme. gimme. gimme.

1193
01:07:00.433 --> 01:07:02.226
- Have Sam run search to the archives.

1194
01:07:02.227 --> 01:07:04.770
Anything related to dominator analytics

1195
01:07:04.771 --> 01:07:06.271
have her start back about two years or so.

1196
01:07:06.272 --> 01:07:07.940
Then take a look at those files.

1197
01:07:07.941 --> 01:07:09.942
Then you can see what I'm talking about.

1198
01:07:09.943 --> 01:07:11.401
I'm on it.

1199
01:07:11.402 --> 01:07:13.070
We have a couple of more time.

1200
01:07:13.071 --> 01:07:16.823
A world of nations and
states. a divided world.

1201
01:07:16.824 --> 01:07:21.495
But at the heart of it all. we
are still a world. one world.

1202
01:07:21.496 --> 01:07:23.331
one people. one future

1203
01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:26.708
and it's not just a hopeful mantra.

1204
01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:29.086
That is the only way
fonnard and the only way

1205
01:07:29.087 --> 01:07:33.006
to ensure the survival.
not only of our species.

1206
01:07:33.007 --> 01:07:35.551
but of this incredible
planet that grew and evolved

1207
01:07:35.552 --> 01:07:38.428
against incredible odds
into this marvelous place

1208
01:07:38.429 --> 01:07:39.681
that we call home.

1209
01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:44.017
Progress is not something
that happens gradually.

1210
01:07:44.018 --> 01:07:47.563
It comes in fits and starts.
sometimes for the better.

1211
01:07:47.564 --> 01:07:49.481
sometimes for the worse.

1212
01:07:49.482 --> 01:07:52.359
So it is absolutely
critical that we utilize

1213
01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:55.280
the opportunities that
existential crises offer us.

1214
01:07:56.197 --> 01:07:57.282
It's Erica Miller.

1215
01:07:58.825 --> 01:08:00.659
Get me someone from dominator analytics.

1216
01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:04.038
This word crisis is
represented by two characters.

1217
01:08:04.956 --> 01:08:09.585
Taken separately. those
two characters mean danger

1218
01:08:09.586 --> 01:08:10.670
and opportunity.

1219
01:08:11.879 --> 01:08:14.047
I don't think I could
have been more clear. buck.

1220
01:08:14.048 --> 01:08:15.215
- You said I was speculating.

1221
01:08:15.216 --> 01:08:16.967
So I brought you back proof this time.

1222
01:08:16.968 --> 01:08:18.468
This?

1223
01:08:18.469 --> 01:08:19.512
This isn't proof.

1224
01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.139
Well. there's a lot more.

1225
01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:23.140
Where?

1226
01:08:23.141 --> 01:08:24.017
It's coming.

1227
01:08:24.017 --> 01:08:25.017
And your source?

1228
01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:29.021
You know. I can't do that.
but I know him and I trust him.

1229
01:08:29.022 --> 01:08:30.731
- Oh. but you don't trust me.

1230
01:08:30.732 --> 01:08:33.191
I know who it is. It's
that crazy professor. huh?

1231
01:08:33.192 --> 01:08:37.696
Who thinks that 9/11 was
a false flag operation?

1232
01:08:37.697 --> 01:08:39.906
You know what? It's your choice Steve.

1233
01:08:39.907 --> 01:08:42.409
But I'm green—lighting this
story with or without you.

1234
01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:44.578
It's not that simple.
This isn'tjust about me.

1235
01:08:44.579 --> 01:08:47.789
- So then call corporate.
talk to the vp of censorship.

1236
01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:49.207
See what they say.

1237
01:08:49.208 --> 01:08:51.043
Let's see if they really
care about the narrative

1238
01:08:51.044 --> 01:08:53.795
or if they care more about
having the biggest cable

1239
01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:55.964
audience on news TV.

1240
01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:57.424
It's what you said. the numbers. right?

1241
01:08:57.425 --> 01:09:00.636
I mean. ratings. advertisers.

1242
01:09:00.637 --> 01:09:01.804
Come on. man.

1243
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:07.143
- Hey. dad.

1244
01:09:07.144 --> 01:09:09.394
Hey. Chloe. are are
you still at the hospice?

1245
01:09:09.395 --> 01:09:10.271
Yeah.

1246
01:09:10.272 --> 01:09:11.438
- I need you to come and see me.

1247
01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:12.856
There's something I wanna show you.

1248
01:09:12.857 --> 01:09:14.316
I can't come home right now. dad.

1249
01:09:14.317 --> 01:09:15.734
No. I'm not at home.

1250
01:09:15.735 --> 01:09:17.319
I'm at new home.

1251
01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:18.779
- You're at the church right now. Why?

1252
01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:19.614
Yeah. Yeah.

1253
01:09:19.615 --> 01:09:22.449
Well. I. look. I found something.

1254
01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:25.452
It's the answers. Pastor
Barnes is here and-

1255
01:09:25.453 --> 01:09:26.745
well. maybe that
should tell you something

1256
01:09:26.746 --> 01:09:28.121
if the pastor's still here.

1257
01:09:28.122 --> 01:09:29.748
No. no. it's not what you think.

1258
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:31.750
And look. look. if you could
just give him a chance and he-

1259
01:09:31.751 --> 01:09:35.921
look. I'm kind of
tied up here right now.

1260
01:09:35.922 --> 01:09:37.839
and I'm really not in the mood for church.

1261
01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:41.051
So I'll talk to you later.

1262
01:09:41.052 --> 01:09:42.678
Say hi to pastor Bruce for me..

1263
01:09:42.679 --> 01:09:43.679
- Yeah. but...

1264
01:09:46.808 --> 01:09:49.893
Amanda. get my chair
and pull the Van around.

1265
01:09:49.894 --> 01:09:51.228
there's an emergency.

1266
01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:53.689
Fern. What is it?

1267
01:09:53.690 --> 01:09:56.233
- I wanna be baptized at your church.

1268
01:09:56.234 --> 01:09:58.820
I heard rumors pastor Barnes is available.

1269
01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:02.115
Alright. Alright.

1270
01:10:04.158 --> 01:10:04.992
Okay. you know what.

1271
01:10:04.993 --> 01:10:07.536
if you're too scared to find
out what's actually going on.

1272
01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:09.162
then I'll just do it without your help.

1273
01:10:09.163 --> 01:10:10.163
- No. you won't.

1274
01:10:11.165 --> 01:10:12.833
What do you mean? No. I won't.

1275
01:10:12.834 --> 01:10:16.002
What I mean is you will
not pursue it. Period.

1276
01:10:16.003 --> 01:10:19.214
As in you are done. Your
show has been canceled.

1277
01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:20.674
Effective immediately.

1278
01:10:20.675 --> 01:10:22.259
- Are you seriously threatening to cancel

1279
01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:24.845
the number one rated news show at gwn

1280
01:10:24.846 --> 01:10:26.388
because I want to cover a story.

1281
01:10:26.389 --> 01:10:28.098
It's not a threat. It's already done.

1282
01:10:28.099 --> 01:10:30.851
And believe me. like I
said. this is way beyond me.

1283
01:10:30.852 --> 01:10:32.018
This is corporate.

1284
01:10:32.019 --> 01:10:36.690
We have had a surge of complaints
about your divisiveness.

1285
01:10:36.691 --> 01:10:37.734
Divisiveness?

1286
01:10:39.944 --> 01:10:43.697
- You've become a symbol
of mistrust of division

1287
01:10:43.698 --> 01:10:44.615
for the people.

1288
01:10:44.616 --> 01:10:48.201
And it's one conspiracy
after the other conspiracy.

1289
01:10:48.202 --> 01:10:50.954
conspiracy. your buyout is being papered.

1290
01:10:50.955 --> 01:10:52.122
It'll be delivered to you tomorrow.

1291
01:10:52.123 --> 01:10:53.999
In the meantime. I
suggest that you go home

1292
01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.459
and get some rest.

1293
01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:58.463
And these fine gentlemen
will show you out.

1294
01:11:10.057 --> 01:11:11.308
Oh. hey. ray.

1295
01:11:11.309 --> 01:11:13.477
- These flyers are great.

1296
01:11:13.478 --> 01:11:15.604
I mean. there's boxes of them back there.

1297
01:11:15.605 --> 01:11:17.481
Pastor billings had
those printed a while ago.

1298
01:11:17.482 --> 01:11:18.732
I had nothing to do with that.

1299
01:11:18.733 --> 01:11:19.900
- Yeah. but they explain
everything that's going on

1300
01:11:19.901 --> 01:11:20.818
in the world right now.

1301
01:11:20.819 --> 01:11:23.111
We should be handing
these out to everyone.

1302
01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:24.529
No. No.

1303
01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:26.490
- Come on. we'll do a service.

1304
01:11:26.491 --> 01:11:27.866
No to a service. — yes.

1305
01:11:27.867 --> 01:11:28.950
You and I know what's going on.

1306
01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:30.368
what's really going on here?

1307
01:11:30.369 --> 01:11:32.288
We can't just sit here and do nothing.

1308
01:11:33.372 --> 01:11:34.372
Hi.

1309
01:11:35.583 --> 01:11:38.169
Hey. Chloe. It's good to see you.

1310
01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:40.670
- Pastor Bruce Barnes.

1311
01:11:40.671 --> 01:11:41.797
Yes. I'm Bruce.

1312
01:11:41.798 --> 01:11:43.799
Well. I hope you don't mind. pastor.

1313
01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.760
but we have some questions for you.

1314
01:11:46.844 --> 01:11:48.220
Well come on in.

1315
01:11:48.221 --> 01:11:49.555
I hope I have some answers.

1316
01:11:56.687 --> 01:11:58.438
I may have something.

1317
01:11:58.439 --> 01:12:02.026
There are three dates and
times in this line of code.

1318
01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:05.111
The first is the day everyone vanished.

1319
01:12:05.112 --> 01:12:07.656
the second is yesterday. the
day of the new vanishings

1320
01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:11.451
and the the third is two days from now.

1321
01:12:11.452 --> 01:12:12.494
- So what does that mean?

1322
01:12:12.495 --> 01:12:13.371
I don't know.

1323
01:12:13.372 --> 01:12:15.664
But the code itself was
written three days before

1324
01:12:15.665 --> 01:12:16.916
the new vanishings.

1325
01:12:18.292 --> 01:12:19.752
- So they knew beforehand.

1326
01:12:22.046 --> 01:12:23.380
How is that even possible?

1327
01:12:23.381 --> 01:12:25.215
Well. I don't know.

1328
01:12:25.216 --> 01:12:28.718
Either they knew something
that the rest of us didn't

1329
01:12:28.719 --> 01:12:31.055
or they weren't involved
in the vanishings.

1330
01:12:31.931 --> 01:12:34.224
There's a third option.

1331
01:12:34.225 --> 01:12:37.310
What if the new vanishings never happened.

1332
01:12:37.311 --> 01:12:39.229
The numbers are pretty
high for it to be rumors.

1333
01:12:39.230 --> 01:12:40.438
No. I know it sounds crazy.

1334
01:12:40.439 --> 01:12:44.234
but I don't know anybody who
knows anybody who disappeared.

1335
01:12:44.235 --> 01:12:45.318
Do you?

1336
01:12:45.319 --> 01:12:46.570
Yes. sure. it's all over the news.

1337
01:12:46.571 --> 01:12:48.155
but it's always somewhere else.

1338
01:12:49.657 --> 01:12:51.491
Try something for me.

1339
01:12:51.492 --> 01:12:54.870
Go back into the Eden system.
Type these three names.

1340
01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:59.375
Michael Parker. Jess
Walker. and Aaron Hewitt.

1341
01:13:01.252 --> 01:13:02.544
- So who are these?

1342
01:13:02.545 --> 01:13:04.671
- They disappeared in
the second vanishing.

1343
01:13:04.672 --> 01:13:05.548
Okay.

1344
01:13:05.549 --> 01:13:08.091
There are several documents
with all three names in them.

1345
01:13:08.092 --> 01:13:11.344
This is an an email that was part of

1346
01:13:11.345 --> 01:13:13.848
an internal memo sent
in the it department.

1347
01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:17.434
Wait. this memo was sent
before the second vanishings

1348
01:13:17.435 --> 01:13:18.435
were reported?

1349
01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:20.396
- Over a week ago.

1350
01:13:21.939 --> 01:13:24.190
That's it. That's our answer.

1351
01:13:24.191 --> 01:13:27.944
It was faked. My guess is these
people never even existed.

1352
01:13:27.945 --> 01:13:30.280
We need to see your guy
and I'm coming with you.

1353
01:13:30.281 --> 01:13:31.865
This might be my last
chance to talk to him

1354
01:13:31.866 --> 01:13:33.826
before words gets out that I lost my show.

1355
01:13:34.785 --> 01:13:36.162
- Wait. you lost your show?

1356
01:13:39.832 --> 01:13:41.083
- My guys should be here.

1357
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:59.893
Connor. thanks for doing this. man.

1358
01:13:59.894 --> 01:14:00.936
Yeah. thanks for thinking of me.

1359
01:14:00.937 --> 01:14:02.562
- Of course.

1360
01:14:02.563 --> 01:14:04.147
Hey. look. I wanna make sure that we do

1361
01:14:04.148 --> 01:14:06.942
a real time upload of the
interview to the cloud

1362
01:14:06.943 --> 01:14:08.401
to make sure we don't lose anything. okay?

1363
01:14:08.402 --> 01:14:10.654
Okay.
— dirk. Connor. Connor. dirk.

1364
01:14:10.655 --> 01:14:11.489
Hey Connor.

1365
01:14:11.490 --> 01:14:12.573
Nice to meet you.

1366
01:14:13.449 --> 01:14:14.908
Have everything you need?

1367
01:14:14.909 --> 01:14:16.785
- Yeah. lemme just double check this box.

1368
01:14:16.786 --> 01:14:18.078
Make sure I have the right cable.

1369
01:14:18.079 --> 01:14:19.538
- I have eyes on the vehicle.

1370
01:14:20.498 --> 01:14:21.999
Both targets confirmed.

1371
01:14:23.918 --> 01:14:24.918
Yes sir.

1372
01:14:26.253 --> 01:14:27.587
- We have a couple more bags.

1373
01:14:27.588 --> 01:14:28.630
Would you mind putting the seats down?

1374
01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:29.840
You got it. — thanks.

1375
01:14:31.342 --> 01:14:32.718
Two or three. — yeah.

1376
01:14:38.557 --> 01:14:40.725
- It's a bomb. run. run. run.

1377
01:14:58.452 --> 01:15:01.830
What about all the evidence
debunking the rapture theory?

1378
01:15:01.831 --> 01:15:05.417
Lots of christians still here.
lots of non—christian gone.

1379
01:15:05.418 --> 01:15:07.836
And don't forget this didn't
happen in the twinkling of

1380
01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:08.713
an eye.

1381
01:15:08.714 --> 01:15:10.256
In fact. it's still happening now.

1382
01:15:11.257 --> 01:15:12.257
They're lying.

1383
01:15:13.134 --> 01:15:14.175
Who's lying?

1384
01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:16.302
Anyone who tells you
this wasn't a rupture?

1385
01:15:16.303 --> 01:15:17.179
That's who.

1386
01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:20.890
When the disciples asked
Jesus on the mount of olives

1387
01:15:20.891 --> 01:15:23.059
what life would be like in the last days.

1388
01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:27.439
his first words were. take
heed that no man deceive you.

1389
01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:29.108
- So how do we know who we can trust?

1390
01:15:30.151 --> 01:15:33.403
Trust god. Trust Jesus.

1391
01:15:33.404 --> 01:15:34.946
Trust the Bible.

1392
01:15:34.947 --> 01:15:36.698
And for literally everyone else.

1393
01:15:36.699 --> 01:15:39.951
take what they're saying to
you and Wade against the word.

1394
01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:43.455
And then you pray. pray.

1395
01:15:43.456 --> 01:15:47.625
Pray for god's help not to be led astray.

1396
01:15:47.626 --> 01:15:51.546
So if this is the rapture.

1397
01:15:51.547 --> 01:15:53.423
then what happens to the rest of us

1398
01:15:53.424 --> 01:15:55.341
who didn't make the cut?

1399
01:15:55.342 --> 01:15:58.428
Well. hopefully we survive tribulation.

1400
01:15:58.429 --> 01:16:00.305
That's what the rapture was all about.

1401
01:16:00.306 --> 01:16:03.391
Jesus taking his church
to heaven to protect them

1402
01:16:03.392 --> 01:16:04.434
from what is to come.

1403
01:16:04.435 --> 01:16:06.269
And what is that. exactly?

1404
01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:08.271
Well. we don't wanna
go into the gory details.

1405
01:16:08.272 --> 01:16:09.148
let's just fo-

1406
01:16:09.148 --> 01:16:10.148
no. I wanna know.

1407
01:16:11.984 --> 01:16:16.029
When it is all over half
the world will be dead.

1408
01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:17.197
Wow.

1409
01:16:17.198 --> 01:16:19.949
So I don't know whether
to be more afraid of god

1410
01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:21.117
or the anti—christ.

1411
01:16:21.118 --> 01:16:22.535
- God. definitely.

1412
01:16:22.536 --> 01:16:25.205
You can hide from the anti—christ.

1413
01:16:25.206 --> 01:16:28.291
What about all the people
who claim that the rapture

1414
01:16:28.292 --> 01:16:29.502
isn't even in the Bible?

1415
01:16:30.586 --> 01:16:32.088
Can you show me where it is?

1416
01:16:35.758 --> 01:16:38.636
1st thessalonians chapter 4.

1417
01:16:39.804 --> 01:16:44.307
"for the lord shall descend
from heaven with a shout

1418
01:16:44.308 --> 01:16:46.684
with the voice of the arch angel.

1419
01:16:46.685 --> 01:16:49.312
and the dead in Christ shall rise first.

1420
01:16:49.313 --> 01:16:52.607
then we which are alive and
remain shall be gathered up

1421
01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:56.486
with them in the clouds to
meet our lord in the air.

1422
01:16:56.487 --> 01:16:59.322
And so shall I ever be with the lord...

1423
01:16:59.323 --> 01:17:00.574
- Sounds good to me.

1424
01:17:02.243 --> 01:17:06.831
I can't wait to see my dear
departed George waiting for me.

1425
01:17:08.916 --> 01:17:10.208
I'll be back tonight.

1426
01:17:10.209 --> 01:17:11.209
Where you going?

1427
01:17:12.044 --> 01:17:14.754
- Just have an old friend
I need to check on.

1428
01:17:24.265 --> 01:17:25.182
Well. I don't understand.

1429
01:17:25.183 --> 01:17:27.268
Why wouldn't you support the Eden project?

1430
01:17:28.394 --> 01:17:30.812
First off. I love the technology.

1431
01:17:30.813 --> 01:17:33.148
I mean. you've done a brilliantjob.

1432
01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:35.108
It's incredibly intuitive.

1433
01:17:35.109 --> 01:17:37.777
Any man or woman. almost
anywhere in the world

1434
01:17:37.778 --> 01:17:40.488
will master it almost
from the first touch.

1435
01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:41.407
Brilliant.

1436
01:17:41.408 --> 01:17:43.575
- Much appreciated nicolae.

1437
01:17:43.576 --> 01:17:45.535
- And you. Jonathan.

1438
01:17:45.536 --> 01:17:49.330
for your foresight and financial
backing to make it happen.

1439
01:17:49.331 --> 01:17:50.707
Without you.

1440
01:17:50.708 --> 01:17:52.501
None of this would've been possible.

1441
01:17:55.171 --> 01:17:56.754
Chaim. if you could
give us a minute. please.

1442
01:17:56.755 --> 01:17:57.755
- Of course.

1443
01:18:00.301 --> 01:18:02.510
I know it all sounds a little scary.

1444
01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:04.220
A little scary?

1445
01:18:04.221 --> 01:18:06.764
Then what would a lot scary sound like?

1446
01:18:06.765 --> 01:18:08.474
- So when does all this happen?

1447
01:18:08.475 --> 01:18:10.268
I mean. are stars gonna fall from the sky

1448
01:18:10.269 --> 01:18:12.312
the moment the peace treaty is signed?

1449
01:18:12.313 --> 01:18:14.439
No. We still have a little time.

1450
01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:16.733
The judgment won't
start until the midpoint

1451
01:18:16.734 --> 01:18:18.693
of the seven years of tribulation.

1452
01:18:18.694 --> 01:18:22.363
Then the antichrist will
declare himself as god.

1453
01:18:22.364 --> 01:18:25.909
I know these political fellows
have pretty high opinions

1454
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:26.993
of themselves.

1455
01:18:26.994 --> 01:18:30.997
but claiming to be god seemed
like a stretch even for them.

1456
01:18:30.998 --> 01:18:35.293
You would think so. but the
entire world will buy into it.

1457
01:18:35.294 --> 01:18:38.254
They will fall down and worship him.

1458
01:18:38.255 --> 01:18:39.255
Really?

1459
01:18:46.013 --> 01:18:48.848
Buck may have lost one of
his oldest friends that day.

1460
01:18:48.849 --> 01:18:51.851
but he knew there was no time
to waste feeling bad about it.

1461
01:18:51.852 --> 01:18:53.436
First of all. nobody gets in here.

1462
01:18:53.437 --> 01:18:54.520
The stakes were much higher

1463
01:18:54.521 --> 01:18:55.897
than one man's death.

1464
01:18:55.898 --> 01:18:58.024
And buck knew that he had
to get dirk's computer

1465
01:18:58.025 --> 01:19:00.026
before the FBI found it and buried it

1466
01:19:00.027 --> 01:19:02.070
in a warehouse somewhere.

1467
01:19:02.071 --> 01:19:03.071
You know the one.

1468
01:19:04.031 --> 01:19:05.740
When he arrived at the university.

1469
01:19:05.741 --> 01:19:07.659
they were still cleaning out dirk's office

1470
01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:10.328
and probably trying to crack that safe

1471
01:19:10.329 --> 01:19:14.624
that almost managed to
give buck a smile. almost.

1472
01:19:14.625 --> 01:19:17.919
Right now though all that
matters was getting that laptop

1473
01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:21.048
and making sure dirk's death
was not going to be in vain.

1474
01:19:42.319 --> 01:19:44.112
There he is. We got him

1475
01:19:56.792 --> 01:19:57.793
Stairs.

1476
01:20:18.856 --> 01:20:21.357
The dumpster. just in case.

1477
01:20:25.696 --> 01:20:27.613
- Let's get outta here.

1478
01:20:27.614 --> 01:20:29.658
Let him get away.

1479
01:21:06.195 --> 01:21:07.195
Great.

1480
01:21:10.824 --> 01:21:12.617
I love the platform.

1481
01:21:12.618 --> 01:21:14.243
It's just too dangerous.

1482
01:21:14.244 --> 01:21:15.120
But nicolae.

1483
01:21:15.121 --> 01:21:17.747
I trust you both and
I'm completely convinced

1484
01:21:17.748 --> 01:21:19.207
that the platform will provide the hope

1485
01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:20.417
that you say it will.

1486
01:21:21.919 --> 01:21:24.670
- You have me at a disadvantaged friend.

1487
01:21:24.671 --> 01:21:25.714
Why the hesitation?

1488
01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:29.927
- You're a good man.
Jonathan. I know this.

1489
01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:33.971
And believe me. I'm a very
good judge of character.

1490
01:21:33.972 --> 01:21:36.015
And if I wasn't completely
convinced that your motives

1491
01:21:36.016 --> 01:21:39.936
were pure. I would've never
considered any of this.

1492
01:21:39.937 --> 01:21:43.481
Well. I appreciate the trust. but?

1493
01:21:43.482 --> 01:21:46.025
What if this ere to
fall in the wrong hands?

1494
01:21:46.026 --> 01:21:47.443
- What do you mean?

1495
01:21:47.444 --> 01:21:49.237
If something were to happen to you?

1496
01:21:49.238 --> 01:21:50.864
Do you have a successor in place?

1497
01:21:52.282 --> 01:21:53.283
Now. I understand.

1498
01:21:55.244 --> 01:21:56.828
You'll be pleased to know
that I've already chosen

1499
01:21:56.829 --> 01:22:00.039
a successor and no one
can persuade me otherwise.

1500
01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:01.125
not even you.

1501
01:22:02.376 --> 01:22:04.085
My choice is final.

1502
01:22:04.086 --> 01:22:06.839
And might I ask. who would that be?

1503
01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:10.509
Well. you. of course.

1504
01:22:19.143 --> 01:22:22.979
You have one new voice message.

1505
01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:24.522
First message.

1506
01:22:24.523 --> 01:22:27.900
Mr. Williams.
there's something going on here.

1507
01:22:27.901 --> 01:22:29.527
Erica Miller is dead.

1508
01:22:29.528 --> 01:22:32.321
They say she od'ed or something
and drowned in her bathtub.

1509
01:22:32.322 --> 01:22:33.824
but I know that's not true.

1510
01:22:34.783 --> 01:22:36.784
This place is swarming with feds.

1511
01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:39.162
They're clearing out her office.

1512
01:22:39.163 --> 01:22:41.831
The feds don't investigate accidents.

1513
01:22:41.832 --> 01:22:43.791
Ivy thinks Erica stole herfiles

1514
01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:46.919
and was digging into stonagal
and dominator analytics.

1515
01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:49.630
And now Mr. Plank. well. he
has the whole team drumming up

1516
01:22:49.631 --> 01:22:53.259
a story that Dr. Burton
was a suicide bomber.

1517
01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:55.386
Look. I'm guessing this
is gonna get me fired.

1518
01:22:55.387 --> 01:22:57.180
but I feel like I have to say something.

1519
01:22:57.181 --> 01:22:58.639
Everything that's happening
in the world right now

1520
01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:00.099
was predicted in the Bible.

1521
01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:01.977
That's where you'll find the answers.

1522
01:23:07.274 --> 01:23:09.358
Hey. ray. — hey.

1523
01:23:09.359 --> 01:23:10.652
Could we talk for a minute?

1524
01:23:11.612 --> 01:23:13.113
- Oh yeah. of course.

1525
01:23:17.117 --> 01:23:20.078
- So you and I were both
married to true believers.

1526
01:23:21.038 --> 01:23:25.583
Can I ask you what stopped
you from hearing it?

1527
01:23:25.584 --> 01:23:29.003
Oh. well.

1528
01:23:29.004 --> 01:23:31.715
I made a lot of mistakes in my life.

1529
01:23:32.758 --> 01:23:37.763
but blaming Irene's faith
for my own bad decisions

1530
01:23:38.805 --> 01:23:42.183
is the biggest one. because she was right.

1531
01:23:42.184 --> 01:23:44.769
But you couldn't have known that then.

1532
01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:46.480
I would've if I had listened.

1533
01:23:48.899 --> 01:23:51.359
- It's easier to see that now.

1534
01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:54.279
Well. not for most people. it seems.

1535
01:23:55.489 --> 01:23:59.952
- So. Irene did herjob.

1536
01:24:00.994 --> 01:24:04.498
- Yeah. she did. She did.

1537
01:24:07.125 --> 01:24:08.418
I knew it was the rapture.

1538
01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:13.090
but I still didn't learn my lesson.

1539
01:24:15.759 --> 01:24:17.134
And what lesson is that?

1540
01:24:17.135 --> 01:24:19.429
Always trying to find
someone else to blame.

1541
01:24:21.098 --> 01:24:23.267
Is never gonna lead you to find the truth.

1542
01:24:24.643 --> 01:24:29.356
I spent months blaming
her for not trying harder.

1543
01:24:30.190 --> 01:24:32.942
but I know if she had tried harder.

1544
01:24:32.943 --> 01:24:34.278
I would've just walked out.

1545
01:24:36.238 --> 01:24:39.741
But you're absolutely
right. Irene did do herjob.

1546
01:24:41.243 --> 01:24:45.121
and now it's up to me to show her

1547
01:24:45.122 --> 01:24:47.207
that her words weren't wasted on me.

1548
01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:51.919
It's your turn.

1549
01:24:53.505 --> 01:24:57.717
- Oh. same story. different excuses.

1550
01:24:57.718 --> 01:25:01.555
I was just never able to get there.

1551
01:25:02.431 --> 01:25:03.432
Get there?

1552
01:25:07.686 --> 01:25:08.686
To the cross.

1553
01:25:10.314 --> 01:25:13.483
I just could never let go of my doubt.

1554
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:16.695
So what was I supposed to do?

1555
01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:23.660
Go up there and kneel
before god and lie to him

1556
01:25:24.578 --> 01:25:28.497
and tell him that I believed
when I knew deep in my heart

1557
01:25:28.498 --> 01:25:30.000
that I wasn't sure.

1558
01:25:33.545 --> 01:25:37.215
Far be it for me to
lecture anybody about faith.

1559
01:25:39.134 --> 01:25:40.886
But I do know this.

1560
01:25:42.179 --> 01:25:44.847
Faith isn't about having no doubt.

1561
01:25:44.848 --> 01:25:46.850
that's not faith. that's knowledge.

1562
01:25:47.976 --> 01:25:52.563
Faith is about taking that walk

1563
01:25:52.564 --> 01:25:54.775
to the cross in spite of it.

1564
01:25:58.153 --> 01:26:03.158
- So. do you no longer have any doubt?

1565
01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:08.914
Well. I still have some.

1566
01:26:09.956 --> 01:26:12.249
but I think that's human nature.

1567
01:26:12.250 --> 01:26:15.879
When I first got down on my knees

1568
01:26:17.172 --> 01:26:18.422
and asked for forgiveness.

1569
01:26:18.423 --> 01:26:22.760
I thought that I would
have to meet Jesus halfway.

1570
01:26:22.761 --> 01:26:25.222
But I was scared

1571
01:26:27.557 --> 01:26:29.601
that I couldn't even get there halfway.

1572
01:26:31.061 --> 01:26:34.313
But see. I remember that we
had this picture of Jesus

1573
01:26:34.314 --> 01:26:39.319
that we hung at home and
it was up there forever.

1574
01:26:39.611 --> 01:26:44.616
and it said. "behold. I
stand at the door and knock."

1575
01:26:46.451 --> 01:26:48.995
I never knew what it meant. but I do now.

1576
01:26:50.414 --> 01:26:54.459
He's knocking at your door right now.

1577
01:26:58.296 --> 01:27:00.173
You don't have to meet him halfway way.

1578
01:27:01.633 --> 01:27:05.053
You just have to open the door.

1579
01:27:20.736 --> 01:27:23.530
Chloe?

1580
01:27:28.118 --> 01:27:29.410
When you told me to meet you here.

1581
01:27:29.411 --> 01:27:32.289
you didn't mention we'd
be digging someone up.

1582
01:27:35.625 --> 01:27:37.169
Are you sure you wanna do this?

1583
01:27:39.963 --> 01:27:41.423
I don't want to. I need to.

1584
01:27:42.632 --> 01:27:43.508
I understand.

1585
01:27:43.509 --> 01:27:47.929
I just. digging up a grave
like this is just a little.

1586
01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:50.097
What? Crazy?

1587
01:27:51.558 --> 01:27:52.934
- I was gonna say extreme.

1588
01:27:56.104 --> 01:27:58.481
Well. I can say the
same thing about stonagal.

1589
01:27:58.482 --> 01:28:00.859
At least the grave I'm
digging isn't my own.

1590
01:28:03.236 --> 01:28:05.196
Chloe. I know what you
hope to find in here.

1591
01:28:05.197 --> 01:28:06.406
but what if it's just.

1592
01:28:11.495 --> 01:28:12.746
Then at least I'll know.

1593
01:28:19.377 --> 01:28:21.797
- Okay. Okay.

1594
01:28:25.091 --> 01:28:26.091
Ready.

1595
01:28:37.395 --> 01:28:41.315
Chloe got what she
needed that night. proof.

1596
01:28:41.316 --> 01:28:43.275
Not just proof of the rapture.

1597
01:28:43.276 --> 01:28:47.446
but something much bigger.
proof that the Bible was right.

1598
01:28:47.447 --> 01:28:51.158
that god was real. that Jesus was real.

1599
01:28:51.159 --> 01:28:52.743
It was undeniable.

1600
01:28:52.744 --> 01:28:54.995
and she truly believed
that she had been gifted

1601
01:28:54.996 --> 01:28:56.205
with a miracle.

1602
01:28:56.206 --> 01:28:58.124
That buck was there to see it with her.

1603
01:28:59.209 --> 01:29:02.378
Even you have to admit.
this is getting pretty hard

1604
01:29:02.379 --> 01:29:03.671
to deny.

1605
01:29:03.672 --> 01:29:06.841
Those who are gone. They knew the truth.

1606
01:29:06.842 --> 01:29:11.847
Brothers. sisters. we can no
longer hide from the truth.

1607
01:29:13.348 --> 01:29:17.810
and we must commit here and
now to accept in the truth.

1608
01:29:17.811 --> 01:29:21.605
and accept in our role in
sharing it with as many people

1609
01:29:21.606 --> 01:29:22.606
as we can.

1610
01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:26.695
We have lied to ourselves for too long.

1611
01:29:27.946 --> 01:29:28.946
Join me.

1612
01:29:30.115 --> 01:29:32.409
Join us.

1613
01:29:33.368 --> 01:29:38.373
J' lord I trouble and sorrow without you j'

1614
01:29:39.666 --> 01:29:44.671
I then there always some never find I

1615
01:29:44.796 --> 01:29:46.298
- hey. aren't you ready?

1616
01:29:47.924 --> 01:29:50.051
- Oh. I can't get saved as a favor to you.

1617
01:29:52.637 --> 01:29:53.805
This is the only way.

1618
01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:57.975
- You should go. I have
to make a quick call.

1619
01:29:57.976 --> 01:29:58.976
I'll be back.

1620
01:30:06.067 --> 01:30:07.067
- Let us pray.

1621
01:30:08.653 --> 01:30:11.156
Lord. we thank you.

1622
01:30:12.282 --> 01:30:15.784
We know that we are
rebuilding our church. lord.

1623
01:30:15.785 --> 01:30:19.039
and we ask for your
guidance as we go fonnard.

1624
01:30:21.166 --> 01:30:23.084
We accept you into our hearts. lord.

1625
01:30:25.211 --> 01:30:28.297
and we are graciously
thankful for your presence

1626
01:30:28.298 --> 01:30:30.007
with us today.

1627
01:30:30.008 --> 01:30:32.135
Thank you. lord Jesus.

1628
01:30:35.138 --> 01:30:36.972
Hi. it's Cameron Williams.

1629
01:30:36.973 --> 01:30:38.432
Buck. how are you my friend?

1630
01:30:38.433 --> 01:30:39.267
Yeah. look. I'm fine.

1631
01:30:39.268 --> 01:30:41.310
I don't have a lot of time.

1632
01:30:41.311 --> 01:30:43.604
Are you alone? — yes.

1633
01:30:43.605 --> 01:30:45.606
I'm calling to warn you.

1634
01:30:45.607 --> 01:30:48.275
I have clear evidence
that Jonathan stonagal.

1635
01:30:48.276 --> 01:30:49.985
is not who he appears to be.

1636
01:30:49.986 --> 01:30:51.737
I've been doing some digging on the guy.

1637
01:30:51.738 --> 01:30:54.323
He's been killing people for
asking too many questions.

1638
01:30:54.324 --> 01:30:55.200
What?

1639
01:30:55.201 --> 01:30:57.993
He's taking your entire Eden
pay project and piggybacked

1640
01:30:57.994 --> 01:30:59.828
all kinds of extras into it.

1641
01:30:59.829 --> 01:31:01.664
Spyware. for lack of better terms.

1642
01:31:01.665 --> 01:31:02.624
But how?

1643
01:31:02.625 --> 01:31:05.042
Trust me. he's done it.

1644
01:31:05.043 --> 01:31:08.879
And as far as the recent
vanishings? All faked by stonagal.

1645
01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:11.507
I have proof that he's
been using you and nicolae

1646
01:31:11.508 --> 01:31:12.509
for his own ends.

1647
01:31:13.426 --> 01:31:15.427
I don't know what to say.

1648
01:31:15.428 --> 01:31:17.471
Look I'm gonna come to you
now. I'll bring the evidence.

1649
01:31:17.472 --> 01:31:21.810
but I need you to tell nicolae
and I need you to do it now.

1650
01:31:35.865 --> 01:31:39.868
Nicolae. I just had
a very disturbing call

1651
01:31:39.869 --> 01:31:41.870
from Cameron Williams.

1652
01:31:41.871 --> 01:31:45.040
He says he has proof that
stonagal is setting us up

1653
01:31:45.041 --> 01:31:48.085
and that he has killed
people in the process.

1654
01:31:48.086 --> 01:31:50.504
- Do you trust him?
- Cameron Williams?

1655
01:31:50.505 --> 01:31:51.547
I've known him for years.

1656
01:31:51.548 --> 01:31:53.717
He's always been completely honest.

1657
01:31:56.636 --> 01:31:58.179
Then we have to bring him in.

1658
01:31:59.431 --> 01:32:01.516
I need to confront both of them in person.

1659
01:32:02.851 --> 01:32:05.812
I'll call an emergency meeting
a security council tomorrow.

1660
01:32:06.646 --> 01:32:07.896
- Good.

1661
01:32:19.909 --> 01:32:22.412
I'm sorry I was so stubborn.

1662
01:32:23.663 --> 01:32:26.498
Guess now we both know
how mom must have felt.

1663
01:32:26.499 --> 01:32:27.499
Yeah.

1664
01:32:28.710 --> 01:32:31.253
- Just got off the phone
with Chaim rosensweig.

1665
01:32:31.254 --> 01:32:34.381
We're gonna confront stonagal
with everything dirk found.

1666
01:32:34.382 --> 01:32:36.300
Hopefully stop him from turning the world

1667
01:32:36.301 --> 01:32:37.384
into a dystopian nightmare.

1668
01:32:37.385 --> 01:32:38.261
I'll see you soon.

1669
01:32:38.261 --> 01:32:39.261
Wait. buck. wait.

1670
01:32:40.096 --> 01:32:43.433
- You. uh. really should
take a look at this first.

1671
01:32:44.559 --> 01:32:45.809
I've seen all this stuff before.

1672
01:32:45.810 --> 01:32:49.396
It's just heads and horns and
beasts could mean anything.

1673
01:32:49.397 --> 01:32:50.439
No offense to the rest of you.

1674
01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:53.108
I just don't happen to believe
our future is pre-ordained.

1675
01:32:53.109 --> 01:32:55.027
So please. let me just finish.

1676
01:32:55.028 --> 01:32:56.487
- Just let you ignore it

1677
01:32:56.488 --> 01:32:58.406
because it doesn't fit your narrative.

1678
01:32:59.949 --> 01:33:01.493
Oh. Chloe

1679
01:33:03.536 --> 01:33:05.329
tooth is two.

1680
01:33:05.330 --> 01:33:07.540
That was the password dirk
used to get into Eden.

1681
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:17.884
Okay. I'm listening.

1682
01:33:20.428 --> 01:33:21.637
Okay. so according to this.

1683
01:33:21.638 --> 01:33:24.056
we should be expecting a Jewish temple.

1684
01:33:24.057 --> 01:33:26.141
which would replace the dome of the rock.

1685
01:33:26.142 --> 01:33:27.768
which would pretty much seem impossible

1686
01:33:27.769 --> 01:33:30.145
if it wasn't for this.

1687
01:33:30.146 --> 01:33:33.190
a peace treaty that gives
Israel the UN's protection

1688
01:33:33.191 --> 01:33:35.734
and such a treaty would
also seem highly unlikely

1689
01:33:35.735 --> 01:33:38.113
if it wasn't for this guy.

1690
01:33:39.114 --> 01:33:40.114
- Right.

1691
01:33:41.241 --> 01:33:42.866
- So you actually think Jonathan stonagal

1692
01:33:42.867 --> 01:33:44.326
is the antichrist?

1693
01:33:44.327 --> 01:33:47.496
Well. if I had to guess
right now. I'd say yes.

1694
01:33:47.497 --> 01:33:49.498
Well. what if that's
what he wants you to guess.

1695
01:33:49.499 --> 01:33:51.125
But why?

1696
01:33:51.126 --> 01:33:52.835
Well. what if he's trying
to get the entire world

1697
01:33:52.836 --> 01:33:54.336
to think he's here to save it?

1698
01:33:54.337 --> 01:33:56.338
I mean. you're the one who
said everyone's gonna worship

1699
01:33:56.339 --> 01:33:57.257
this guy.

1700
01:33:57.258 --> 01:33:59.049
Well. what about nicolae carpathia?

1701
01:33:59.050 --> 01:34:01.260
I mean. he certainly gets
good crowds behind him.

1702
01:34:01.261 --> 01:34:03.428
No. no. nicolae could care
less about having people

1703
01:34:03.429 --> 01:34:04.264
love him.

1704
01:34:04.265 --> 01:34:05.389
So why would he pretend to be the-

1705
01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:07.850
buck we're we're not talking
about anyone pretending

1706
01:34:07.851 --> 01:34:09.184
to be the anti—christ.

1707
01:34:09.185 --> 01:34:12.397
We're talking about someone
being the anti—christ.

1708
01:34:13.314 --> 01:34:14.773
Now. I can't make you believe anything.

1709
01:34:14.774 --> 01:34:16.024
No one can.

1710
01:34:16.025 --> 01:34:17.985
But don't turn this into a conspiracy

1711
01:34:17.986 --> 01:34:20.445
just because you wanna avoid the truth.

1712
01:34:20.446 --> 01:34:23.532
I have seen what's inside
the Eden pay project.

1713
01:34:23.533 --> 01:34:26.118
and believe me. it's not a pretty picture.

1714
01:34:26.119 --> 01:34:28.537
If this guy gets in control
of the entire world's money

1715
01:34:28.538 --> 01:34:30.664
supply. I mean. think
about what that would mean.

1716
01:34:30.665 --> 01:34:33.293
- Oh. I could tell you exactly
what that's gonna mean.

1717
01:34:36.629 --> 01:34:40.257
He causes all. both small
and great. rich and poor.

1718
01:34:40.258 --> 01:34:43.844
free and slave to receive
a Mark on their right hand

1719
01:34:43.845 --> 01:34:47.890
or in their forehead and
that no one may buy or sell

1720
01:34:47.891 --> 01:34:49.934
except one who has the Mark.

1721
01:34:55.815 --> 01:34:57.983
- Chaim just talked to nicolae.

1722
01:34:57.984 --> 01:34:59.860
We're gonna meet first
thing in the morning.

1723
01:34:59.861 --> 01:35:02.864
I have a lot of work to do. Gotta go. bye.

1724
01:35:05.325 --> 01:35:06.325
Pray for me.

1725
01:35:07.619 --> 01:35:10.205
The boy's gonna need a
whole lot more than prayer.

1726
01:35:14.584 --> 01:35:18.670
- Buck are you even listening
to a word they said?

1727
01:35:18.671 --> 01:35:19.631
You can't go there.

1728
01:35:19.632 --> 01:35:21.089
I heard the same thing you did.

1729
01:35:21.090 --> 01:35:22.650
Well. it doesn't look that way to me.

1730
01:35:23.801 --> 01:35:26.178
- Chloe. you found what
you were looking for

1731
01:35:26.179 --> 01:35:27.846
and I'm so happy that you did.

1732
01:35:27.847 --> 01:35:30.724
But that was your answer. not mine.

1733
01:35:30.725 --> 01:35:31.767
I'm still looking.

1734
01:35:31.768 --> 01:35:35.146
That wasn't my answer.
That was the answer.

1735
01:35:36.898 --> 01:35:37.774
I understand.

1736
01:35:37.775 --> 01:35:39.275
No. I don't think you do.

1737
01:35:40.485 --> 01:35:41.902
I know.

1738
01:35:41.903 --> 01:35:44.863
I have to go. I'll be
very careful. I promise.

1739
01:35:44.864 --> 01:35:45.864
- Hey. just.

1740
01:35:49.577 --> 01:35:50.577
At least take this.

1741
01:36:00.421 --> 01:36:02.589
I love you. Chloe Steele.

1742
01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:04.008
I love you too.

1743
01:36:23.027 --> 01:36:26.071
- Sorry to drop all this on
you at the last minute. I just.

1744
01:36:26.072 --> 01:36:28.824
- These are high stakes.
buck. I understand that.

1745
01:36:28.825 --> 01:36:31.076
And so does nicolae.

1746
01:36:31.077 --> 01:36:33.245
We have to do it properly and we will.

1747
01:36:33.246 --> 01:36:35.206
God is with Israel. remember?

1748
01:36:36.124 --> 01:36:38.292
- Yeah. I just hope the
peace accord with Israel

1749
01:36:38.293 --> 01:36:40.127
can still happen without stonagal.

1750
01:36:40.128 --> 01:36:44.131
If god wants it to happen
now. it will happen now.

1751
01:36:44.132 --> 01:36:47.968
But this is not just
about the peace treaty.

1752
01:36:47.969 --> 01:36:52.514
I have long dreamed of finally
having the temple rebuilt on

1753
01:36:52.515 --> 01:36:53.890
the temple mount.

1754
01:36:53.891 --> 01:36:55.809
And when stonagal agreed to finance it.

1755
01:36:55.810 --> 01:36:58.438
it was the happiest day of my life.

1756
01:37:00.106 --> 01:37:02.316
Well. what about the dome of the rock?

1757
01:37:02.317 --> 01:37:04.151
Are the arabs really just
gonna let you tear it down?

1758
01:37:04.152 --> 01:37:06.153
- No. Of course not.

1759
01:37:06.154 --> 01:37:08.322
Stonagal's team located the foundations of

1760
01:37:08.323 --> 01:37:10.449
the original temple.

1761
01:37:10.450 --> 01:37:14.494
It's beside the dome not under it.

1762
01:37:14.495 --> 01:37:15.662
- So you can have both.

1763
01:37:15.663 --> 01:37:18.081
- Yes. and peace in the middle east.

1764
01:37:18.082 --> 01:37:21.960
arabs and Jews worshiping
side by side in Harmony.

1765
01:37:21.961 --> 01:37:23.920
And even though the initial peace treaty

1766
01:37:23.921 --> 01:37:26.632
will only be seven years. I think...

1767
01:37:27.675 --> 01:37:29.384
What's wrong. buck?

1768
01:37:29.385 --> 01:37:31.136
- Did you just say seven years?

1769
01:37:31.137 --> 01:37:32.137
Yes.

1770
01:37:36.225 --> 01:37:37.435
I just need a minute.

1771
01:37:56.788 --> 01:37:57.955
It's all real.

1772
01:37:58.998 --> 01:38:00.166
It's all real.

1773
01:38:14.222 --> 01:38:16.057
I didn't want to believe in you. god.

1774
01:38:18.101 --> 01:38:20.978
but I was wrong and I'm so sorry.

1775
01:38:28.361 --> 01:38:29.445
Forgive me Jesus.

1776
01:38:34.867 --> 01:38:36.244
I just know that I need you

1777
01:38:38.913 --> 01:38:39.914
and I do believe.

1778
01:38:57.014 --> 01:38:58.141
Show me what to do.

1779
01:39:00.518 --> 01:39:03.103
Jesus promised that
where two or three gather

1780
01:39:03.104 --> 01:39:05.897
in my name. there I am with them.

1781
01:39:05.898 --> 01:39:09.484
We gathered and we prayed
and I felt his presence

1782
01:39:09.485 --> 01:39:11.028
for the very first time.

1783
01:39:13.531 --> 01:39:15.991
Hey. Connor. it's me. buck.

1784
01:39:15.992 --> 01:39:18.910
I got your message and I
just wanted to let you know

1785
01:39:18.911 --> 01:39:19.911
you were right.

1786
01:39:20.913 --> 01:39:22.956
I found the truth in the
only place it can be found.

1787
01:39:22.957 --> 01:39:24.541
Oh. thank you Jesus.

1788
01:39:24.542 --> 01:39:26.461
I'm gonna need your help with something.

1789
01:39:35.136 --> 01:39:37.137
Connor. Good. you got my message.

1790
01:39:37.138 --> 01:39:38.889
Buck still had his focus clearly

1791
01:39:38.890 --> 01:39:42.601
on his journalistic duty
to expose stonagal's lies.

1792
01:39:42.602 --> 01:39:45.312
But he also knew there
was a very real chance

1793
01:39:45.313 --> 01:39:48.440
that no matter what evidence
he brought to the table.

1794
01:39:48.441 --> 01:39:50.567
old Steve plank would
never let that news see

1795
01:39:50.568 --> 01:39:52.153
the light of day.

1796
01:39:53.112 --> 01:39:56.615
Connor was buck's insurance
policy against being censored

1797
01:39:56.616 --> 01:39:59.117
and he hoped theirfaith
would be enough to keep them

1798
01:39:59.118 --> 01:40:01.328
from being deceived by stonagal.

1799
01:40:01.329 --> 01:40:03.915
even if he was working
for the devil himself.

1800
01:40:05.458 --> 01:40:08.168
Hi. I'm. — Mr. Cameron Williams.

1801
01:40:08.169 --> 01:40:09.836
Good morning.

1802
01:40:09.837 --> 01:40:11.796
Please see a member of
security team on your way in.

1803
01:40:11.797 --> 01:40:12.757
They'll show you the way.

1804
01:40:12.757 --> 01:40:13.757
Thank you.

1805
01:40:15.968 --> 01:40:19.095
Ephesians chapter six tells
us to put on the full armor

1806
01:40:19.096 --> 01:40:21.223
of god so that you can take your stand

1807
01:40:21.224 --> 01:40:23.308
against the devil's schemes.

1808
01:40:23.309 --> 01:40:25.101
Well. buck may not have known it.

1809
01:40:25.102 --> 01:40:27.103
but when he walked into the room that day.

1810
01:40:27.104 --> 01:40:28.813
he was ready.

1811
01:40:28.814 --> 01:40:31.650
ready like he had never been before.

1812
01:40:31.651 --> 01:40:34.027
He hit them with
everything he and dirk had

1813
01:40:34.028 --> 01:40:36.947
uncovered. exposing beyond
the shadow of a doubt.

1814
01:40:36.948 --> 01:40:40.450
stonagal's evil plan to deceive the world.

1815
01:40:40.451 --> 01:40:44.621
As soon as he was finished. he
felt a huge flood of relief.

1816
01:40:44.622 --> 01:40:46.456
He had managed to get
the truth to the people

1817
01:40:46.457 --> 01:40:49.834
who needed to hear it. or so it seemed.

1818
01:40:49.835 --> 01:40:52.212
- So. as you can clearly see

1819
01:40:52.213 --> 01:40:55.924
this diabolical plan. not only
take over the money supply.

1820
01:40:55.925 --> 01:40:58.636
but to enslave the world
into technocratic nightmare

1821
01:41:00.638 --> 01:41:02.473
was all set up at the highest levels.

1822
01:41:03.641 --> 01:41:04.641
Thank you.

1823
01:41:09.438 --> 01:41:14.067
Thankfully. Mr. Williams
investigation has put the pieces

1824
01:41:14.068 --> 01:41:18.697
together showing all of us
that Jonathan has plotted.

1825
01:41:18.698 --> 01:41:20.615
lied. and murdered.

1826
01:41:20.616 --> 01:41:24.244
not only to gain control of Eden currency.

1827
01:41:24.245 --> 01:41:27.415
but the entire global financial network.

1828
01:41:29.834 --> 01:41:30.917
That's ridiculous.

1829
01:41:30.918 --> 01:41:31.961
What's going on here?

1830
01:41:34.130 --> 01:41:35.298
That is the question.

1831
01:41:36.465 --> 01:41:39.218
The question each of us has been asking

1832
01:41:41.596 --> 01:41:44.140
what is really going on?

1833
01:41:45.766 --> 01:41:48.101
Mr. Williams. for example.

1834
01:41:48.102 --> 01:41:52.480
he has employed his skills
to draw certain conclusions

1835
01:41:52.481 --> 01:41:53.481
about you.

1836
01:41:54.358 --> 01:41:57.862
But in fact. if he thinks
about it hard enough.

1837
01:41:59.322 --> 01:42:03.158
he'll have to ask himself
who was on the inside

1838
01:42:03.159 --> 01:42:05.870
that gave him access to what exactly.

1839
01:42:09.790 --> 01:42:14.294
A highly convenient file.
full of evidence implicating

1840
01:42:14.295 --> 01:42:18.174
Jonathan of all he's been
accused of here today.

1841
01:42:20.259 --> 01:42:22.595
I half expected you to
see right through that.

1842
01:42:24.263 --> 01:42:28.850
And Chaim. your fervent dream
to bring peace to Israel

1843
01:42:28.851 --> 01:42:30.019
has been granted.

1844
01:42:31.103 --> 01:42:33.022
if only you understood the cost.

1845
01:42:36.817 --> 01:42:41.071
And Jonathan. this goes
much deeper for you.

1846
01:42:41.072 --> 01:42:42.614
doesn't it?

1847
01:42:42.615 --> 01:42:45.950
Beyond your endless
thirst for more control

1848
01:42:45.951 --> 01:42:50.205
and material gain. you really
see yourself as a great man

1849
01:42:50.206 --> 01:42:53.125
rebuilding the world in your own image

1850
01:42:54.168 --> 01:42:56.420
certainly needed no help
from me to see that.

1851
01:42:58.506 --> 01:43:00.341
You have paved the way.

1852
01:43:01.592 --> 01:43:05.596
That is your contribution to history.

1853
01:43:07.556 --> 01:43:09.724
This is preposterous.

1854
01:43:09.725 --> 01:43:10.685
You can't just come in here.

1855
01:43:10.686 --> 01:43:13.687
make these baseless allegations
and think you can take

1856
01:43:13.688 --> 01:43:16.064
what I built. what is mine?

1857
01:43:16.065 --> 01:43:18.275
How do you think you're
gonna do that. nicolae?

1858
01:43:19.235 --> 01:43:21.403
Let me tell you what is about to happen.

1859
01:43:21.404 --> 01:43:24.614
An assassin masquerading
as a security guard

1860
01:43:24.615 --> 01:43:29.620
will draw his gun intent on
killing Mr. Stonagal and myself.

1861
01:43:30.913 --> 01:43:34.624
In a hail of gunfire.
Mr. Cothran and stonagal

1862
01:43:34.625 --> 01:43:36.252
will be fatally wounded.

1863
01:43:37.128 --> 01:43:40.088
Oh. barely escape with my life.

1864
01:43:40.089 --> 01:43:42.842
Thanks to security guards
who quickly return fire.

1865
01:43:46.345 --> 01:43:47.345
- You're insane?

1866
01:43:48.764 --> 01:43:51.142
What makes you think you
can get away with this?

1867
01:43:52.101 --> 01:43:56.312
By simply killing you.

1868
01:43:58.441 --> 01:44:02.820
You see. Jonathan. there will be peace.

1869
01:44:04.029 --> 01:44:05.029
but not with you.

1870
01:44:07.825 --> 01:44:09.909
Nicolae?

1871
01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:10.911
Your time is over

1872
01:44:12.246 --> 01:44:14.707
and mine has just begun.

1873
01:44:37.062 --> 01:44:42.067
And now. now I am devastated by the loss.

1874
01:44:43.527 --> 01:44:48.239
yet forced to take up

1875
01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:51.201
the mantle of his leadership.

1876
01:44:51.202 --> 01:44:54.455
Oh. my god.

1877
01:45:12.056 --> 01:45:14.098
Dear. god. Jonathan.

1878
01:45:16.894 --> 01:45:17.770
- Are you okay?

1879
01:45:17.771 --> 01:45:20.564
It was awful when that
security guard started firing.

1880
01:45:23.442 --> 01:45:24.318
- Did you see what happened?

1881
01:45:24.319 --> 01:45:26.570
- Yes. poor nicolae. Who
would wanna kill him?

1882
01:45:27.613 --> 01:45:30.573
- Hurry.
- — Did you see that.

1883
01:45:30.574 --> 01:45:31.825
Who started firing?

1884
01:45:31.826 --> 01:45:33.744
Is so crazy.

1885
01:45:41.669 --> 01:45:45.797
Mr Williams. This is crazy!
Did you see it?

1886
01:45:45.798 --> 01:45:48.384
I think I know what really
happened. Come with me.

1887
01:45:52.638 --> 01:45:53.681
- Buck. are you okay?

1888
01:45:55.933 --> 01:45:57.309
Hey. what's going on?

1889
01:46:02.815 --> 01:46:04.233
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

1890
01:46:33.178 --> 01:46:36.432
Yes.

1891
01:46:56.785 --> 01:47:00.663
- Ladies and gentlemen. my
name is nicolae carpathia

1892
01:47:00.664 --> 01:47:02.624
and I come to you tonight
with a heavy heart.

1893
01:47:02.625 --> 01:47:05.085
- Good afternoon. My
name's Cameron Williams.

1894
01:47:06.295 --> 01:47:07.838
I'm here to tell you a story.

1895
01:47:08.797 --> 01:47:11.926
story about lies from the media.

1896
01:47:12.801 --> 01:47:16.972
harder story about the
only truth that matters.

1897
01:47:20.267 --> 01:47:22.977
Nicolae carpathia is the
new secretary general

1898
01:47:22.978 --> 01:47:26.147
of the UN and right now
he is making a speech.

1899
01:47:26.148 --> 01:47:30.693
Well. I'm here to tell you it's all lies.

1900
01:47:30.694 --> 01:47:33.696
Looks like Cameron Williams
finally found the truth.

1901
01:47:33.697 --> 01:47:34.697
Yes.

1902
01:47:35.366 --> 01:47:36.909
- He's gotta be on this floor.

1903
01:47:39.495 --> 01:47:42.705
He told you that the vanishings
came with no warnings.

1904
01:47:42.706 --> 01:47:45.166
with no explanation.

1905
01:47:45.167 --> 01:47:48.878
Then there was a second
wave of vanishings.

1906
01:47:48.879 --> 01:47:52.423
And worst of all. he
told you that the rapture

1907
01:47:52.424 --> 01:47:54.425
had been debunked.

1908
01:47:54.426 --> 01:47:56.427
Take a picture of your
screen right now and...

1909
01:47:56.428 --> 01:47:57.428
Turn it off.

1910
01:47:57.429 --> 01:47:59.305
And no matter what you may hear.

1911
01:47:59.306 --> 01:48:02.809
it's not too late to let
Jesus Christ set you free.

1912
01:48:02.810 --> 01:48:03.935
I'm proof of that.

1913
01:48:03.936 --> 01:48:06.312
When buck's broadcast
went out to the world.

1914
01:48:06.313 --> 01:48:08.439
it felt like a huge victory.

1915
01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:10.733
But the Bible warned us
it wouldn't be as easy

1916
01:48:10.734 --> 01:48:13.319
as just telling everyone the truth.

1917
01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:14.862
But I've always taught.

1918
01:48:14.863 --> 01:48:18.282
and now I believe that even
if a single soul is saved.

1919
01:48:18.283 --> 01:48:20.827
then your efforts have not been in vain.

1920
01:48:20.828 --> 01:48:23.121
Right now. though. the
impact of buck's message

1921
01:48:23.122 --> 01:48:24.956
would have to be analyzed later.

1922
01:48:24.957 --> 01:48:26.958
He knew some people were bound to disagree

1923
01:48:26.959 --> 01:48:28.168
with what he had to say.

1924
01:49:38.238 --> 01:49:39.655
- Are you guys okay?

1925
01:50:07.267 --> 01:50:08.309
Made it just in time.

1926
01:50:08.310 --> 01:50:10.312
Now you gotta stop doing this to me.

1927
01:50:12.731 --> 01:50:14.065
Everyone okay?

1928
01:50:14.066 --> 01:50:15.775
Yeah. — all good.

1929
01:50:15.776 --> 01:50:18.194
They were all so
anxious and even excited

1930
01:50:18.195 --> 01:50:20.571
to start sharing the word with the world.

1931
01:50:20.572 --> 01:50:22.406
It was wonderful to see.

1932
01:50:22.407 --> 01:50:25.827
but they'd only been studying
prophecy for a few days.

1933
01:50:25.828 --> 01:50:28.704
The reality of the final seven
years before the return of

1934
01:50:28.705 --> 01:50:31.208
Christ hadn't started sinking in just yet.

1935
01:50:32.376 --> 01:50:35.628
Jesus told us these last years
would be worse than anything

1936
01:50:35.629 --> 01:50:37.588
the world had ever seen.

1937
01:50:37.589 --> 01:50:39.465
- Here's a good spot. right?

1938
01:50:39.466 --> 01:50:42.301
God gave us an
exemption if we wanted it.

1939
01:50:42.302 --> 01:50:45.429
But for those of us who
chose not to take it.

1940
01:50:45.430 --> 01:50:48.850
those of us who were left behind. well.

1941
01:50:48.851 --> 01:50:51.018
we'll just have to see what happens.

1942
01:50:51.019 --> 01:50:52.020
Hey. look.

1943
01:50:53.897 --> 01:50:55.606
I know there's nothing we can do

1944
01:50:55.607 --> 01:50:58.234
to stop what's been
prophesied from happening.

1945
01:50:58.235 --> 01:51:00.903
but that doesn't mean we just give up.

1946
01:51:00.904 --> 01:51:02.489
Not even close.

1947
01:51:03.365 --> 01:51:05.533
There are souls to be saved.

1948
01:51:05.534 --> 01:51:09.913
And as long as there are.
our mission is clear.

1949
01:51:10.998 --> 01:51:16.003
J' facing defeat I am holding
onto your promise now I
