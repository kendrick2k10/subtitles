3
00:01:28.438 --> 00:01:30.372
Sorry. Excuse me.

4
00:01:36.215 --> 00:01:38.116
Excuse me. Sorry about that.

5
00:01:39.284 --> 00:01:41.383
- Oh. Sorry.
- Yeah.

6
00:01:41.418 --> 00:01:44.419
No. That's my...

7
00:01:44.454 --> 00:01:47.323
Hey. guys. I'm just gonna
squeeze past you here. Sorry.

8
00:02:10.678 --> 00:02:11.908
Hi.

9
00:02:21.656 --> 00:02:22.919
Hmm.

10
00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:33.270
Hi.

11
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.373
Is that yarn?

12
00:02:37.408 --> 00:02:39.210
Yes. Yeah.

13
00:02:39.245 --> 00:02:41.278
Huh.

14
00:02:45.746 --> 00:02:48.516
- Is it... is it yarn?
- It's y-- Yeah.

15
00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:49.979
It's-it's yarn.

16
00:03:11.673 --> 00:03:13.937
Thank you so much for coming.

17
00:03:17.415 --> 00:03:19.613
- Slow night.
- Yeah.

18
00:03:21.485 --> 00:03:23.749
You know. I-I don't really need
anyone to buy my art.

19
00:03:23.784 --> 00:03:26.653
It would just be nice
if someone understood it.

20
00:03:26.688 --> 00:03:28.655
May I offer you
another perspective?

21
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.788
Sure.

22
00:03:29.823 --> 00:03:31.526
I do need people
to buy your art.

23
00:03:31.561 --> 00:03:33.957
- I'm sorry.
- There's one collector left.

24
00:03:33.992 --> 00:03:36.234
Go talk to him.

25
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.030
You know.
maybe my work is stronger

26
00:03:41.065 --> 00:03:42.603
if I let it speak for itself...

27
00:03:42.638 --> 00:03:44.242
- Go!
- Sure thing.

28
00:03:49.414 --> 00:03:51.040
Uh. excuse me.

29
00:03:51.075 --> 00:03:53.581
- Oh. thank you.
- Hi.

30
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:56.617
Actually. no.

31
00:03:56.652 --> 00:03:58.685
S-Sorry. I'm not the...

32
00:04:06.761 --> 00:04:07.925
Aren.

33
00:04:09.027 --> 00:04:12.303
Does the last collector here
think you're a waiter?

34
00:04:12.338 --> 00:04:13.865
Okay.

35
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.999
I'm canceling
your solo show next month.

36
00:04:16.034 --> 00:04:19.035
No. no.
I already bought the materials.

37
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.576
I...

38
00:04:21.611 --> 00:04:23.809
I spent $3.000 on yarn.

39
00:04:23.844 --> 00:04:26.416
That may be. but if you
can't stick up for your work.

40
00:04:26.451 --> 00:04:28.352
I can't do it for you.

41
00:06:52.256 --> 00:06:53.992
Can you. can you help me?

42
00:06:57.162 --> 00:07:00.702
The machine's being a dick.

43
00:07:01.672 --> 00:07:03.870
Um...

44
00:07:03.905 --> 00:07:05.740
Yeah. okay. Sure.

45
00:07:05.775 --> 00:07:08.138
- What do you need?
- Can you get cash for me?

46
00:07:08.173 --> 00:07:11.482
My PIN is 310... -No. no.
you shouldn't tell me your PIN.

47
00:07:11.517 --> 00:07:15.552
...555-0164.

48
00:07:16.654 --> 00:07:18.753
Actually. I think
that might be a phone number.

49
00:07:19.987 --> 00:07:22.053
Hold on.

50
00:07:25.025 --> 00:07:26.761
Uh...

51
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.864
Where... Where's my card?

52
00:07:30.899 --> 00:07:32.162
It's in the machine.

53
00:07:32.197 --> 00:07:34.032
Oh. my God. Where's my...

54
00:07:34.067 --> 00:07:35.968
Brad?

55
00:07:37.103 --> 00:07:39.103
Someone stole my debit card.

56
00:07:39.138 --> 00:07:40.973
It's-it's still in the AT...

57
00:07:41.008 --> 00:07:43.173
- Help!
- No. no. no. no!

58
00:07:43.208 --> 00:07:44.878
- Dude. dude! No. no. no.
- Whoa.

59
00:07:44.913 --> 00:07:47.914
No. -Dude. dude! You have
headshots in the morning.

60
00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:49.685
He just stole her purse. man!

61
00:07:55.055 --> 00:07:58.221
Look. she's got her purse.

62
00:07:59.224 --> 00:08:01.895
But it was right there.

63
00:08:04.295 --> 00:08:08.198
I'm sorry to bother y'all.
but...

64
00:08:08.233 --> 00:08:09.903
did one of y'all
lose an earring?

65
00:08:09.938 --> 00:08:12.708
Oh. my God. yes!

66
00:08:12.743 --> 00:08:15.205
I saw it on my way over
to meet my friend here.

67
00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.174
And let me just say.
I know it ain't his.

68
00:08:17.209 --> 00:08:19.176
Oh. my God. thank you.

69
00:08:19.211 --> 00:08:22.817
I would've been wearing one
earring like a freakin' pirate.

70
00:08:27.021 --> 00:08:29.186
By any chance. are you all
going to get some food?

71
00:08:29.221 --> 00:08:30.924
Yeah.

72
00:08:30.959 --> 00:08:33.157
There's a barbecue spot
that just opened on La Brea.

73
00:08:33.192 --> 00:08:34.697
My cousin runs it.

74
00:08:34.732 --> 00:08:36.831
They got a killer review
in the <i>LA Weekly.</i>

75
00:08:36.866 --> 00:08:38.701
I don't know anything
about that.

76
00:08:38.736 --> 00:08:43.299
All I know is they pull pork
just like my grandma used to.

77
00:08:44.302 --> 00:08:45.840
I love pork.

78
00:08:45.875 --> 00:08:47.710
You tell them Roger sent you.

79
00:08:47.745 --> 00:08:49.877
and they'll bring out
the good stuff. -Thanks. man.

80
00:08:51.177 --> 00:08:53.782
Hey. uh...

81
00:08:53.817 --> 00:08:55.751
no hard feelings. man.

82
00:08:55.786 --> 00:08:57.786
Yeah. no. Yeah.

83
00:09:08.997 --> 00:09:10.766
- You good?

84
00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:15.837
Yeah. I c-- I could've sworn
that I had her bag.

85
00:09:15.872 --> 00:09:17.905
Let's get off the street.

86
00:09:19.711 --> 00:09:21.777
You know. these white
folks looking at you crazy.

87
00:09:21.812 --> 00:09:24.241
- that doesn't bother you?
It's no big deal.

88
00:09:24.276 --> 00:09:27.277
- It's a goddamn menace.
- It's-it's annoying.

89
00:09:27.312 --> 00:09:29.686
People looking at me
like I'm...

90
00:09:29.721 --> 00:09:31.347
whatever exactly
they think that I am.

91
00:09:31.382 --> 00:09:34.020
But. you know. it-it's not like
it happens every day.

92
00:09:34.055 --> 00:09:35.351
So you saying
people don't look at you

93
00:09:35.386 --> 00:09:36.990
like that every day?

94
00:09:37.025 --> 00:09:38.893
Well. that happens every day.

95
00:09:38.928 --> 00:09:40.862
you know.
if I go outside or whatever.

96
00:09:40.897 --> 00:09:42.292
but it doesn't escalate
every day

97
00:09:42.327 --> 00:09:44.228
is what I-- is what I'm saying.

98
00:09:44.263 --> 00:09:45.900
Is that so?

99
00:09:45.935 --> 00:09:47.264
I'm not living in fear.

100
00:09:47.299 --> 00:09:50.036
I mean. is there fear?

101
00:09:50.071 --> 00:09:51.675
Yeah.

102
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:53.743
Am I living in it?

103
00:09:56.913 --> 00:09:59.210
- No?
- What?

104
00:09:59.245 --> 00:10:01.916
You were just explaining
how none of this affects you.

105
00:10:01.951 --> 00:10:05.117
I just. uh...

106
00:10:05.152 --> 00:10:07.691
try not to think about it.
I guess.

107
00:10:13.226 --> 00:10:15.424
Look. I don't want
to waste your time. Aren.

108
00:10:15.459 --> 00:10:17.096
but I saw you at the gallery.

109
00:10:17.131 --> 00:10:19.802
Right. yeah.
You were at the bar.

110
00:10:19.837 --> 00:10:22.266
And I followed you because
I think you're very talented.

111
00:10:22.301 --> 00:10:25.137
- My work?
- Uh. you mean the yarn thing?

112
00:10:25.172 --> 00:10:26.776
No. that didn't make
no kind of sense.

113
00:10:26.811 --> 00:10:28.338
But you?

114
00:10:28.373 --> 00:10:31.979
You I get. and I want
to take you to a job interview.

115
00:10:32.014 --> 00:10:34.113
Oh. no. I don't know anything
about bartending.

116
00:10:34.148 --> 00:10:36.115
Second job.
You need money. right?

117
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:38.887
I need the yarn store to change
its return policy.

118
00:10:38.922 --> 00:10:40.449
- Can it do that?
- Yeah.

119
00:10:40.484 --> 00:10:42.990
- What?
- I mean. it pays good.

120
00:10:44.092 --> 00:10:45.696
What is it exactly?

121
00:10:45.731 --> 00:10:47.962
Officially.
it's a client services firm.

122
00:10:47.997 --> 00:10:52.131
but unofficially.
we saving the damn world.

123
00:10:54.333 --> 00:10:55.937
I don't really understand.

124
00:10:55.972 --> 00:10:57.070
It's easier to show you.

125
00:10:57.105 --> 00:10:58.137
- Here.
- Now?

126
00:10:58.172 --> 00:10:59.710
Yeah.

127
00:10:59.745 --> 00:11:01.745
Okay. -You got
any medical conditions?

128
00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:03.846
- Heart disease? Eczema?
- What?

129
00:11:03.881 --> 00:11:05.243
N-No. Why would that...

130
00:11:09.788 --> 00:11:11.348
What? Hmm?

131
00:11:11.383 --> 00:11:13.119
- This way.
- Where are we?

132
00:11:14.287 --> 00:11:16.188
D-Did I just black out?

133
00:11:16.223 --> 00:11:17.860
I moved us a little.

134
00:11:17.895 --> 00:11:19.092
- You moved-- What?

135
00:11:19.127 --> 00:11:20.929
Hey. yo. wait. wait.

136
00:11:20.964 --> 00:11:22.865
Hey. Roger.

137
00:11:28.268 --> 00:11:30.235
How y'all doing?

138
00:11:53.293 --> 00:11:55.128
The hell is going on?!

139
00:11:55.163 --> 00:11:57.834
Now. I'm probably supposed to
start slower with all of this.

140
00:11:57.869 --> 00:12:00.969
but there's a recruiting class
starting right now.

141
00:12:01.004 --> 00:12:03.169
and we got to get you in it.

142
00:12:03.204 --> 00:12:04.533
Recruiting for what?

143
00:12:06.878 --> 00:12:08.977
Welcome...

144
00:12:09.012 --> 00:12:13.179
to the American Society
of Magical Negroes.

145
00:12:13.214 --> 00:12:16.215
Over the next few days.
we'll introduce you to our work

146
00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:20.252
and determine if any of you
are fit for membership.

147
00:12:20.287 --> 00:12:25.026
Now. since every education
starts with the classics.

148
00:12:25.061 --> 00:12:26.456
let's take a look at

149
00:12:26.491 --> 00:12:29.800
some of our most accomplished
predecessors.

150
00:12:29.835 --> 00:12:34.530
James Crampton. Savannah. 1923.

151
00:12:37.205 --> 00:12:39.975
Watch his approach to the work.

152
00:12:55.861 --> 00:12:58.191
Well. that's
a peculiar shot. suh.

153
00:13:00.591 --> 00:13:02.030
Where'd you come from?

154
00:13:02.065 --> 00:13:04.263
Oh. I was just
passing through. suh.

155
00:13:04.298 --> 00:13:08.036
Or should I say Mr. Avery?

156
00:13:08.071 --> 00:13:09.598
Hey.

157
00:13:09.633 --> 00:13:11.908
How'd you know my name?

158
00:13:11.943 --> 00:13:13.437
Well...

159
00:13:13.472 --> 00:13:16.242
everybody in the state
of Georgia who like billiards

160
00:13:16.277 --> 00:13:18.211
knows Beauregard Avery.

161
00:13:18.246 --> 00:13:23.117
Is it true that you once
snapped your cue on the break

162
00:13:23.152 --> 00:13:26.384
then ran the table
with one of the splinters?

163
00:13:26.419 --> 00:13:29.519
I haven't played
since... the war.

164
00:13:31.226 --> 00:13:33.259
You done lost your stroke.

165
00:13:33.294 --> 00:13:36.031
- Excuse me?
- Uh. billiard stroke. suh.

166
00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:40.871
You know. they say
a man's grip on his cue...

167
00:13:40.906 --> 00:13:42.939
is like his grip on life.

168
00:13:44.437 --> 00:13:46.503
Let me see how you holding it.

169
00:13:50.641 --> 00:13:54.544
Now. see. you thinking 'bout
whether you gon' miss.

170
00:13:56.152 --> 00:13:59.120
Maybe you missed a little bit
in your life.

171
00:14:00.486 --> 00:14:03.894
But you can't
think on that now.

172
00:14:03.929 --> 00:14:08.426
Now you gots to just
close your eyes

173
00:14:08.461 --> 00:14:10.527
and get your stroke back.

174
00:14:17.602 --> 00:14:20.207
Not bad. Mr. Avery.

175
00:14:20.242 --> 00:14:22.110
Not bad.

176
00:14:22.145 --> 00:14:25.509
Now. obviously. you'll be using
a more contemporary dialect

177
00:14:25.544 --> 00:14:29.117
and a lot of other innovations
we've made since Jim's time.

178
00:14:29.152 --> 00:14:33.055
But he was a master
of the fundamentals.

179
00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:37.290
So. what did you notice about
Jim's approach to the work?

180
00:14:37.325 --> 00:14:40.293
He doesn't make it
about himself.

181
00:14:40.328 --> 00:14:42.064
It's always about the client.

182
00:14:46.103 --> 00:14:48.235
- Client service first.

183
00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:49.302
What else?

184
00:14:49.337 --> 00:14:51.337
He's really friendly.

185
00:14:51.372 --> 00:14:53.273
That's crucial.

186
00:14:56.443 --> 00:14:59.147
- Anything else?
- He's wearing suspenders.

187
00:15:02.317 --> 00:15:06.055
Okay. Let's take a look
at another one.

188
00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:10.994
Marcus Dunham. 1955.

189
00:15:12.492 --> 00:15:15.295
GUARD
Dead man walking!

190
00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.264
This isn't right. Marcus.

191
00:15:17.299 --> 00:15:20.498
Well. boss. it ain't about
the life leaving this world.

192
00:15:20.533 --> 00:15:23.006
It's about the life
coming into it.

193
00:15:23.041 --> 00:15:24.469
What do you mean?

194
00:15:24.504 --> 00:15:25.734
I know that you and the missus

195
00:15:25.769 --> 00:15:28.374
been having trouble
making life.

196
00:15:28.409 --> 00:15:30.376
I'm just barely scraping by
in this job.

197
00:15:30.411 --> 00:15:33.214
so it's hard to go home
and feel like a man.

198
00:15:33.249 --> 00:15:35.084
Now. you listen here. boss.

199
00:15:35.119 --> 00:15:36.382
Who snuck me that harmonica

200
00:15:36.417 --> 00:15:38.318
so I could speak my soul
fore I go?

201
00:15:38.353 --> 00:15:40.254
- I did. but...
- That took courage.

202
00:15:40.289 --> 00:15:41.684
That was done by a man.

203
00:15:41.719 --> 00:15:44.225
So when Mrs. Bossman
look at you tonight.

204
00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:45.424
know that she looking at

205
00:15:45.459 --> 00:15:47.756
the greatest man
in Kennebec County.

206
00:16:11.617 --> 00:16:13.386
What about this one?

207
00:16:16.556 --> 00:16:17.687
Anybody else?

208
00:16:17.722 --> 00:16:19.689
The spiritual was a nice touch.

209
00:16:19.724 --> 00:16:21.493
Perceived authenticity.

210
00:16:21.528 --> 00:16:25.563
Your interests and hobbies
have to be authentically Black

211
00:16:25.598 --> 00:16:27.730
as understood by the culture.

212
00:16:27.765 --> 00:16:32.108
We're showing the client
the parts of ourselves

213
00:16:32.143 --> 00:16:34.407
that make them feel good.

214
00:16:36.378 --> 00:16:38.015
And nothing more.

215
00:16:45.684 --> 00:16:48.619
Nope! Nope!

216
00:16:51.228 --> 00:16:52.722
Mm-mm.

217
00:17:09.741 --> 00:17:11.279
No. I'm sorry.

218
00:17:11.314 --> 00:17:13.380
You can't conjure yourself
a steak dinner.

219
00:17:13.415 --> 00:17:15.745
Magic only works
in the service of clients.

220
00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:17.285
So if he's dieting.
you're dieting.

221
00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.155
Mm-hmm. Uh. right.

222
00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:21.223
If she knows that much. you'll
have to do a memory spell.

223
00:17:21.258 --> 00:17:22.554
Mind if I take control

224
00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:23.753
of your powers remotely?

225
00:17:23.788 --> 00:17:26.426
Anything medical
requires physical touch.

226
00:17:26.461 --> 00:17:28.560
Even if he's sweaty. yes.

227
00:17:28.595 --> 00:17:31.332
No. that's me
controlling your powers.

228
00:17:32.698 --> 00:17:34.500
This is nice. Yeah.
I like it.

229
00:17:34.535 --> 00:17:36.634
- Not too tight?
Not too tight. no.

230
00:17:36.669 --> 00:17:38.240
Cause it's got to be nostalgic.

231
00:17:38.275 --> 00:17:39.571
but it can't be
too sharecropper.

232
00:17:39.606 --> 00:17:41.309
Oh. no. of course not.

233
00:17:41.344 --> 00:17:43.410
We're not doing <i>Roots.</i>

234
00:17:43.445 --> 00:17:45.511
- ♪ ♪

235
00:17:48.681 --> 00:17:50.747
♪ Like a vice grip
on my heart... ♪

236
00:17:52.256 --> 00:17:53.420
How goes?

237
00:17:54.456 --> 00:17:57.325
It's...
it's really interesting.

238
00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.656
It's. um--

239
00:17:58.691 --> 00:18:01.395
You know. the name needs
a little updating.

240
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:04.233
maybe like
"Magical Black People" or--

241
00:18:04.268 --> 00:18:05.729
I guess that doesn't have
the same ring. but. uh...

242
00:18:05.764 --> 00:18:07.467
What are you trying to say?

243
00:18:08.767 --> 00:18:11.735
I'm not sure this is for me.

244
00:18:16.643 --> 00:18:18.643
It really has
nothing to do with you.

245
00:18:18.678 --> 00:18:21.580
and-and I'm sure the work makes
a ton of sense for you guys.

246
00:18:21.615 --> 00:18:24.385
It just seems. you know.
for my personal taste...

247
00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.849
It's a little. um...

248
00:18:26.884 --> 00:18:29.456
- Please take me home.
- You ain't going home.

249
00:18:35.398 --> 00:18:37.266
Holy shit.

250
00:18:40.832 --> 00:18:42.436
It's bigger than you.

251
00:18:42.471 --> 00:18:44.735
We've been around
since before this was...

252
00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:45.802
Is this...?

253
00:18:47.542 --> 00:18:48.640
Monticello.

254
00:18:48.675 --> 00:18:50.378
- What?
- Yeah.

255
00:18:50.413 --> 00:18:51.544
Secret wing.

256
00:18:51.579 --> 00:18:53.447
Oh. okay.

257
00:18:53.482 --> 00:18:56.549
- The truth is. Aren...
- I'm in Virginia?

258
00:18:56.584 --> 00:18:58.518
...you've got talent.

259
00:18:59.719 --> 00:19:01.851
Sorry. the building is gone.

260
00:19:01.886 --> 00:19:02.852
Yeah.

261
00:19:02.887 --> 00:19:04.623
And talent like yours

262
00:19:04.658 --> 00:19:06.526
can do more to help Black
people than a hundred marches.

263
00:19:06.561 --> 00:19:08.429
How?

264
00:19:09.861 --> 00:19:11.465
It's easier if I show you.

265
00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.764
No. no. no.
Last time you said that...

266
00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:21.937
Aren. what's the most dangerous
animal on the planet?

267
00:19:21.972 --> 00:19:23.609
- Sharks.
- White people.

268
00:19:23.644 --> 00:19:25.479
When are white people
most dangerous?

269
00:19:25.514 --> 00:19:27.844
When they're teamed up
with sharks.

270
00:19:27.879 --> 00:19:29.285
When they feel uncomfortable.

271
00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:30.550
Okay. were sharks
a part of it or...

272
00:19:30.585 --> 00:19:31.881
White people
feeling uncomfortable

273
00:19:31.916 --> 00:19:33.817
precedes a lot
of bad stuff for us.

274
00:19:33.852 --> 00:19:35.753
White people move into
a neighborhood.

275
00:19:35.788 --> 00:19:38.426
they feel uncomfortable:
gentrification.

276
00:19:38.461 --> 00:19:40.758
- Okay.
- White cop sees a Black man.

277
00:19:40.793 --> 00:19:42.628
feels uncomfortable:
another shooting.

278
00:19:42.663 --> 00:19:44.993
Was a time when all you had
to do was look at a white man

279
00:19:45.028 --> 00:19:46.467
and make him uncomfortable.

280
00:19:46.502 --> 00:19:47.699
That was pretty much it
for you.

281
00:19:47.734 --> 00:19:49.437
Yeah. I get that.
I'm just not the...

282
00:19:49.472 --> 00:19:53.342
For some of us. the last thing
we see in this world

283
00:19:53.377 --> 00:19:55.377
is an uncomfortable white man.

284
00:19:55.412 --> 00:19:57.247
But I don't blame
white people for that.

285
00:19:57.282 --> 00:19:59.678
I blame their discomfort.

286
00:19:59.713 --> 00:20:01.284
That's why we here

287
00:20:01.319 --> 00:20:03.814
at the American Society
of Magical Negroes

288
00:20:03.849 --> 00:20:07.719
fight white discomfort
every damn day.

289
00:20:07.754 --> 00:20:11.459
We are the vanguard
of white relaxation.

290
00:20:11.494 --> 00:20:12.889
Black knights making sure

291
00:20:12.924 --> 00:20:15.023
that they don't take it out
on a brother.

292
00:20:15.058 --> 00:20:18.532
Because the happier they are.
the safer we are.

293
00:20:20.635 --> 00:20:21.832
Wow.

294
00:20:24.969 --> 00:20:27.002
You see that cop over there?

295
00:20:27.037 --> 00:20:28.674
Far as we know. he may be

296
00:20:28.709 --> 00:20:30.808
the next one to shoot
an unarmed Black man.

297
00:20:30.843 --> 00:20:32.942
Him?
- I didn't bring you here

298
00:20:32.977 --> 00:20:35.450
for sharks. Aren.

299
00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:37.551
I brought you here for this.

300
00:20:37.586 --> 00:20:39.454
<i>We are constantly monitoring</i>

301
00:20:39.489 --> 00:20:42.919
<i>the happiness of every
white person in America.</i>

302
00:20:42.954 --> 00:20:46.263
And when one gets
too unhappy...

303
00:20:47.431 --> 00:20:49.398
- ...they become a client.

304
00:20:49.433 --> 00:20:50.993
Excuse me. Officer?

305
00:20:51.028 --> 00:20:54.865
<i>But they won't know
they're a client.</i>

306
00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.438
<i>So you'll use</i>

307
00:20:56.473 --> 00:20:58.033
<i>- a white tears meter</i>

308
00:20:58.068 --> 00:21:00.508
<i>to get a reading
of their distress levels.</i>

309
00:21:00.543 --> 00:21:02.444
<i>- And it will also let you know</i>

310
00:21:02.479 --> 00:21:03.907
<i>when their distress</i>

311
00:21:03.942 --> 00:21:07.515
has returned to acceptable
white person levels.

312
00:21:09.013 --> 00:21:10.881
Man. I looked in the mirror
this morning.

313
00:21:10.916 --> 00:21:12.751
I swear to God.

314
00:21:12.786 --> 00:21:15.820
I look more like my father
than I look like myself.

315
00:21:17.725 --> 00:21:20.726
Well. it's like my grandmama
always used to tell me.

316
00:21:20.761 --> 00:21:23.696
There's only two fighters
you can't beat:

317
00:21:23.731 --> 00:21:25.533
Joe Louis and Father Time.

318
00:21:25.568 --> 00:21:27.337
I just want to know
I still have it.

319
00:21:27.372 --> 00:21:28.866
You know?

320
00:21:30.903 --> 00:21:33.068
We're thinking about
going to a club tonight.

321
00:21:34.775 --> 00:21:36.775
Like...

322
00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:38.909
from music videos?

323
00:21:38.944 --> 00:21:41.109
Really exclusive.

324
00:21:41.144 --> 00:21:43.485
He and I can get in.

325
00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.916
I mean. if you can...

326
00:21:45.951 --> 00:21:48.556
maybe you're not
as far gone as you think.

327
00:21:53.959 --> 00:21:55.695
I want to do that.

328
00:22:01.604 --> 00:22:02.966
Look. Aren.

329
00:22:03.001 --> 00:22:05.100
this is a one-night job.

330
00:22:05.135 --> 00:22:09.478
Nice. easy client like we use
in trainings or on holiday.

331
00:22:09.513 --> 00:22:10.743
But don't let that fool you.

332
00:22:10.778 --> 00:22:12.481
Black lives are depending
on this.

333
00:22:12.516 --> 00:22:14.813
Look. Roger. for me.
I don't think

334
00:22:14.848 --> 00:22:17.145
that keeping white people happy
is as big a deal

335
00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:18.718
- as you're saying it is.
- Oh. yeah?

336
00:22:18.753 --> 00:22:20.786
Why are you so nice?

337
00:22:22.185 --> 00:22:24.152
Because I'm friendly.

338
00:22:24.187 --> 00:22:25.494
Because white people
will kill you.

339
00:22:25.529 --> 00:22:26.858
Okay.

340
00:22:26.893 --> 00:22:29.124
And I think you recognize this
in some way.

341
00:22:29.159 --> 00:22:31.060
and now you're trying
to get out in front of it.

342
00:22:31.095 --> 00:22:34.536
Roger. if I were hyperaware
of white people. I would know.

343
00:22:34.571 --> 00:22:36.098
- Oh. yeah?
- Yeah.

344
00:22:36.133 --> 00:22:37.770
Do you remember that white guy
that just passed us?

345
00:22:37.805 --> 00:22:40.102
- Yeah.
- You're blocking his way.

346
00:22:40.137 --> 00:22:41.741
I'm so sorry. I...

347
00:22:46.781 --> 00:22:49.551
- That's not nice.
- Let's try a little experiment.

348
00:22:49.586 --> 00:22:52.081
I want you to walk
in that crowd.

349
00:22:52.116 --> 00:22:53.588
Why?

350
00:22:53.623 --> 00:22:54.820
Well. it shouldn't be
a big deal to you

351
00:22:54.855 --> 00:22:56.492
since you so good
with white people.

352
00:22:56.527 --> 00:22:58.725
My mom's white.
I grew up with white people.

353
00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.892
And I'm sure that didn't
mess you up at all.

354
00:23:00.927 --> 00:23:02.762
So. I don't need to go.

355
00:23:02.797 --> 00:23:04.192
You scared?

356
00:23:04.227 --> 00:23:05.963
- No.
- Then go.

357
00:23:05.998 --> 00:23:08.702
I-I don't want to go.

358
00:23:08.737 --> 00:23:10.198
- You're scared.
- Okay. you know. fine.

359
00:23:10.233 --> 00:23:11.474
I'll go.

360
00:23:11.509 --> 00:23:12.772
For you.

361
00:23:12.807 --> 00:23:14.444
Thank you.

362
00:23:52.649 --> 00:23:55.551
I know you can feel
their discomfort. Aren.

363
00:23:57.687 --> 00:24:01.524
It's the loudest thing
in every room you walk into.

364
00:24:02.527 --> 00:24:04.626
Probably has been
your whole life.

365
00:24:05.728 --> 00:24:09.697
What did you do to make them
look at you that way?

366
00:24:09.732 --> 00:24:12.733
And what are they going to do
to you next?

367
00:24:13.967 --> 00:24:16.198
White discomfort
is your nemesis. Aren.

368
00:24:16.233 --> 00:24:19.542
Stop running from it
and start listening to it.

369
00:24:20.545 --> 00:24:21.709
Hey. hey.

370
00:24:22.976 --> 00:24:24.679
What's up. fellas?

371
00:24:26.045 --> 00:24:27.583
Oh. man.

372
00:24:27.618 --> 00:24:29.750
This place looks awesome.

373
00:24:29.785 --> 00:24:31.213
There's no way I'm getting in.

374
00:24:31.248 --> 00:24:32.687
Have you seen me?

375
00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:35.954
- Give it a shot.
- It's not happening.

376
00:24:35.989 --> 00:24:38.594
It was stupid
to even come here.

377
00:24:38.629 --> 00:24:40.255
Ah! Stupid.

378
00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:42.532
What was I thinking?

379
00:24:42.567 --> 00:24:43.929
God. this is the outfit
that I pick.

380
00:24:43.964 --> 00:24:45.260
I'm like.
"Oh. I'm gonna go to the club.

381
00:24:45.295 --> 00:24:47.097
Let's get my club outfit
out of the closet."

382
00:24:47.132 --> 00:24:49.165
- I bought new shoes...
- Don't look at me. Aren.

383
00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.266
- Look at him.

384
00:24:51.301 --> 00:24:53.708
Only him.

385
00:24:53.743 --> 00:24:56.744
Put everything out of your mind

386
00:24:56.779 --> 00:25:02.882
and focus on
his pale-ass feelings.

387
00:25:03.951 --> 00:25:06.314
<i>As a member of the Society.</i>

388
00:25:06.349 --> 00:25:09.020
there's no more making sure
your hands are visible

389
00:25:09.055 --> 00:25:10.725
just in case

390
00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.793
or wondering if they're gonna
call the cops on you

391
00:25:12.828 --> 00:25:15.191
for doing
totally normal things.

392
00:25:15.226 --> 00:25:17.193
Now you'll know.

393
00:25:17.228 --> 00:25:21.065
You'll know exactly
how distressed they are

394
00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:23.199
and how to soothe them.

395
00:25:23.234 --> 00:25:26.301
<i>so you won't have to be afraid.</i>

396
00:25:33.112 --> 00:25:35.013
I see him.

397
00:25:35.048 --> 00:25:37.653
Then go and comfort him.

398
00:25:39.723 --> 00:25:41.316
They call me
a pencil-pushing nerd.

399
00:25:41.351 --> 00:25:42.922
Hey.

400
00:25:42.957 --> 00:25:44.726
Rules are important.

401
00:25:44.761 --> 00:25:45.826
Listen.

402
00:25:47.225 --> 00:25:49.995
Doesn't matter
how they look at you.

403
00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:52.063
It matters how you look at you.

404
00:25:56.168 --> 00:25:57.574
Yeah.

405
00:25:58.742 --> 00:25:59.939
You're right.

406
00:26:08.983 --> 00:26:11.654
Hey. Can we get in?

407
00:26:21.094 --> 00:26:22.830
Actually. yeah.

408
00:26:23.998 --> 00:26:25.261
Yes.

409
00:26:26.297 --> 00:26:29.265
Guys. thank you.

410
00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.135
Now. let's do this.

411
00:26:34.272 --> 00:26:35.975
What did I just do?

412
00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:38.978
You made your world
a safer place.

413
00:26:39.013 --> 00:26:41.651
- I want to do that again.
- It's your job.

414
00:26:58.263 --> 00:27:00.395
Ladies and gentlemen.

415
00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:04.839
the president of the American
Society of Magical Negroes.

416
00:27:04.874 --> 00:27:06.170
Dede Booker.

417
00:27:34.497 --> 00:27:38.741
Do we seem like gods
to you. Aren?

418
00:27:39.744 --> 00:27:41.172
Uh...

419
00:27:41.207 --> 00:27:43.812
Flattering but untruthful.

420
00:27:43.847 --> 00:27:47.046
In reality. we are only
as mighty as we are united.

421
00:27:47.081 --> 00:27:51.380
You see. Aren.
our powers are collective.

422
00:27:51.415 --> 00:27:54.020
If any member
uses magic selfishly.

423
00:27:54.055 --> 00:27:56.319
fails to put
their client first.

424
00:27:56.354 --> 00:28:00.092
all our powers fail.
and we cannot fail.

425
00:28:01.227 --> 00:28:03.898
Every year of our existence.

426
00:28:03.933 --> 00:28:07.396
the life expectancy
of Black Americans has risen.

427
00:28:07.431 --> 00:28:11.268
and members of our society
live five years past that.

428
00:28:11.303 --> 00:28:13.743
which brings us on par with...

429
00:28:14.504 --> 00:28:17.472
...white nonsmokers.

430
00:28:17.507 --> 00:28:20.409
And the privilege
and responsibility

431
00:28:20.444 --> 00:28:24.248
was upheld by Rosie...
the Riveter's nanny

432
00:28:24.283 --> 00:28:26.481
and Crispus Attucks.

433
00:28:26.516 --> 00:28:29.088
He really took one
for the team.

434
00:28:29.123 --> 00:28:32.993
And we can't forget Nancy Green
and her trademark syrup

435
00:28:33.028 --> 00:28:35.391
that funds our work today.

436
00:28:37.131 --> 00:28:40.462
So. understanding
this noble burden.

437
00:28:40.497 --> 00:28:42.068
will you join?

438
00:28:45.271 --> 00:28:46.875
Yes.

439
00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:49.108
Well. I officially welcome you

440
00:28:49.143 --> 00:28:53.013
to the American Society
of Magical Negroes.

441
00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:30.380
- You ready?
- Oh. wow.

442
00:29:32.252 --> 00:29:34.087
Um...

443
00:29:34.122 --> 00:29:35.352
Yeah.

444
00:29:53.944 --> 00:29:55.570
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

445
00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:19.935
- Hello?
- Why aren't you here yet?

446
00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:22.333
Uh. yeah. I just. uh.
I needed a second.

447
00:30:22.368 --> 00:30:24.005
I have to brief you
on your first client.

448
00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:25.875
Also. why am I
looking at a table?

449
00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:28.075
Okay. I'll be right in
and we can talk.

450
00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:30.011
- I'm sorry. Oh. I'm so sorry.
-  It's okay.

451
00:30:30.046 --> 00:30:31.441
- I wasn't looking and...
- It's okay. It's fine.

452
00:30:31.476 --> 00:30:32.475
Sorry. -You're fine.
Don't worry about it.

453
00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:33.542
Can I buy you a new one?

454
00:30:36.019 --> 00:30:37.480
Uh. yeah. Okay. sure.

455
00:30:37.515 --> 00:30:39.053
- That's-that's nice of you.
- Okay.

456
00:30:48.625 --> 00:30:50.526
Oh. my God.
I was looking for coffee.

457
00:30:50.561 --> 00:30:53.265
I was looking to make sure that
I didn't spill coffee on you.

458
00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:54.904
- Yeah. no. I wouldn't...
- And I realize that totally

459
00:30:54.939 --> 00:30:56.367
looked like
I was checking you out.

460
00:30:56.402 --> 00:30:58.369
I was not checking you out.
I wouldn't do that.

461
00:30:58.404 --> 00:30:59.601
Yeah. okay.

462
00:30:59.636 --> 00:31:01.207
I-I was not doing that.
I promise.

463
00:31:01.242 --> 00:31:02.439
Okay.

464
00:31:04.641 --> 00:31:09.413
I would. I would do that
if it was. like. uh--

465
00:31:09.448 --> 00:31:12.482
You're beautiful.
and I-I would...

466
00:31:12.517 --> 00:31:16.321
In a checkout-appropriate
situation. I would do that.

467
00:31:16.356 --> 00:31:18.389
Well. what would be
a... a situation

468
00:31:18.424 --> 00:31:21.029
where it's appropriate
to check me out?

469
00:31:21.064 --> 00:31:24.461
No. like a date or a...

470
00:31:24.496 --> 00:31:26.331
betrothal or--
I don't know what I'm saying.

471
00:31:26.366 --> 00:31:28.432
It's-- I was really
just looking for coffee.

472
00:31:28.467 --> 00:31:31.402
- It's okay.
- Thank you. Sorry.

473
00:31:38.015 --> 00:31:40.609
I don't... I don't believe you.

474
00:31:40.644 --> 00:31:43.117
- You don't believe me? Why?
- No. You just...

475
00:31:43.152 --> 00:31:44.987
You just said that
you weren't checking me out.

476
00:31:45.022 --> 00:31:46.615
and then you said I was pretty.

477
00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:48.419
So how would you decide
that I was pretty?

478
00:31:48.454 --> 00:31:50.157
There's a difference.
there's a difference between

479
00:31:50.192 --> 00:31:51.554
noticing how someone looks
and. like... -Okay. Okay.

480
00:31:51.589 --> 00:31:54.095
...skeevily. like.
looking them up and down.

481
00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:55.492
Okay. thanks
for letting me know.

482
00:31:55.527 --> 00:31:57.098
And I didn't say
that you were pretty actually.

483
00:31:57.133 --> 00:31:59.133
- I didn't say that.
- You did.

484
00:31:59.168 --> 00:32:00.431
- I just heard what you said.
- No.

485
00:32:00.466 --> 00:32:03.104
No. I said that you
were beautiful.

486
00:32:14.249 --> 00:32:15.479
Okay.

487
00:32:17.252 --> 00:32:20.088
- Okay.
- Yeah. No. I...

488
00:32:20.123 --> 00:32:21.221
Okay. I believe you.

489
00:32:21.256 --> 00:32:22.288
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

490
00:32:22.323 --> 00:32:23.520
It's a very nice thing to do.

491
00:32:23.555 --> 00:32:25.258
Not check you out?

492
00:32:25.293 --> 00:32:26.556
No. check me for coffee stains.

493
00:32:26.591 --> 00:32:28.228
That's...

494
00:32:28.263 --> 00:32:30.263
That's a very sweet thing
to do.

495
00:32:30.298 --> 00:32:33.035
Well. I'm very nice.
It's-it's. like. a flaw.

496
00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:35.433
Yeah? Says who?

497
00:32:42.706 --> 00:32:44.211
Oh. thanks.
I didn't even check myself.

498
00:32:44.246 --> 00:32:45.608
Yeah. am I good?

499
00:32:45.643 --> 00:32:46.675
Hmm?

500
00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:48.380
Am I coffee-free?

501
00:32:49.482 --> 00:32:52.384
Oh. I don't know.
I was just looking at that ass.

502
00:32:53.387 --> 00:32:55.057
Wow.

503
00:32:55.092 --> 00:32:57.092
- Terrible.
- Yeah. you like that?

504
00:32:57.127 --> 00:32:59.523
- I'm sorry.

505
00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:03.659
- Uh...

506
00:33:04.827 --> 00:33:07.399
Uh...

507
00:33:07.434 --> 00:33:09.071
I'm s-- I have to go.

508
00:33:09.106 --> 00:33:11.370
I'm so sorry.

509
00:33:11.405 --> 00:33:13.240
Oh.

510
00:33:13.275 --> 00:33:14.769
Sorry.

511
00:33:17.378 --> 00:33:19.543
Your first client
is a Jason Mundt.

512
00:33:19.578 --> 00:33:21.479
You'll be working with him
in graphic design.

513
00:33:21.514 --> 00:33:23.514
where we felt your background
in yarn and shit

514
00:33:23.549 --> 00:33:24.647
will come in handy.

515
00:33:24.682 --> 00:33:26.583
<i>Jason works at MeetBox.</i>

516
00:33:26.618 --> 00:33:28.750
<i>the most influential social
media platform in the world.</i>

517
00:33:28.785 --> 00:33:31.588
<i>Millions of white people
see his designs every day</i>

518
00:33:31.623 --> 00:33:34.789
<i>as they post and like and do
whatever else they do on there.</i>

519
00:33:34.824 --> 00:33:36.362
<i>You will be a deckhand.</i>

520
00:33:36.397 --> 00:33:37.561
<i>That's one level below
a boatswain.</i>

521
00:33:37.596 --> 00:33:38.826
Come again?

522
00:33:38.861 --> 00:33:41.070
Spelled "boat" "swain."

523
00:33:41.105 --> 00:33:42.698
Yeah. but are we at sea?

524
00:33:42.733 --> 00:33:44.832
Well. they felt
normal job titles

525
00:33:44.867 --> 00:33:47.175
- were a bit too corporate.
- Okay.

526
00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:50.277
His meter jumped dangerously
high Tuesday 4:00 p.m.

527
00:33:50.312 --> 00:33:52.147
He was so upset
we considered sending in

528
00:33:52.182 --> 00:33:54.149
a team of
rapid response Negroes.

529
00:33:54.184 --> 00:33:55.513
but they were all my age

530
00:33:55.548 --> 00:33:57.746
and really didn't understand
what MeetBox did.

531
00:33:57.781 --> 00:34:00.650
So his morale is still
far too low.

532
00:34:00.685 --> 00:34:03.620
Your job is to figure out
what caused the jump

533
00:34:03.655 --> 00:34:06.359
and identify what he wants.

534
00:34:06.394 --> 00:34:08.097
There's a lot of research

535
00:34:08.132 --> 00:34:10.330
that if you spend
less time working.

536
00:34:10.365 --> 00:34:12.200
you're actually more productive.

537
00:34:12.235 --> 00:34:14.664
And that is why we've got
snacks. we've got games.

538
00:34:14.699 --> 00:34:16.567
we've got cots
if you want to take a nap.

539
00:34:16.602 --> 00:34:19.471
Oh. that's great. -Yeah.
we also have a laundry service.

540
00:34:19.506 --> 00:34:21.176
We've got a car wash.

541
00:34:21.211 --> 00:34:23.277
You know. basically
you could just sleep here.

542
00:34:23.312 --> 00:34:25.279
Do a lot of people sleep here?
You keep saying...

543
00:34:25.314 --> 00:34:27.875
- Oh. no. No. no.
- Okay. cool.

544
00:34:27.910 --> 00:34:29.547
Although I could use a nap.

545
00:34:31.353 --> 00:34:32.748
I'm fine.

546
00:34:32.783 --> 00:34:34.288
- This is Jason.

547
00:34:34.323 --> 00:34:36.290
You're gonna work together
a lot. -Hey.

548
00:34:36.325 --> 00:34:38.259
- Hey.
No. darn it.

549
00:34:38.294 --> 00:34:41.592
Um. I was hoping there was
a station right next to him.

550
00:34:41.627 --> 00:34:44.364
but there's not. so why don't
you come downstairs with me.

551
00:34:45.895 --> 00:34:47.829
- Oh. is this one spoken for?
- Hmm?

552
00:34:51.835 --> 00:34:53.901
No.

553
00:34:53.936 --> 00:34:56.541
Uh. why don't you
just settle in.

554
00:34:56.576 --> 00:34:58.279
Great.

555
00:35:01.317 --> 00:35:02.877
Looks like we're neighbors.

556
00:35:02.912 --> 00:35:05.451
Yeah. I-I guess so.

557
00:35:08.654 --> 00:35:10.852
You like games?

558
00:35:10.887 --> 00:35:12.722
Guard-guard it.
Guard your goal.

559
00:35:12.757 --> 00:35:14.295
- You better guard it.
Okay. I'm-I'm trying.

560
00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:15.890
You better guard it.
I'm close. I'm close!

561
00:35:16.926 --> 00:35:18.860
- Oh!
- Okay.

562
00:35:18.895 --> 00:35:20.433
- Damn.
- Yes.

563
00:35:20.468 --> 00:35:22.204
- The streak is real.
- Got me again.

564
00:35:22.239 --> 00:35:23.469
Three in a row.

565
00:35:23.504 --> 00:35:25.174
- Whew.
- You practice this. don't you?

566
00:35:25.209 --> 00:35:27.572
Yeah.
I got one of these at home.

567
00:35:28.542 --> 00:35:30.542
- Lizzie.
- Uh. hey.

568
00:35:31.545 --> 00:35:32.577
Hey.

569
00:35:32.612 --> 00:35:34.216
I...

570
00:35:34.251 --> 00:35:37.252
I... I-I...
I just started working here.

571
00:35:37.287 --> 00:35:39.353
That's cool. Oh. my God.
I-I've worked here for a while.

572
00:35:39.388 --> 00:35:41.487
That-that makes sense
why you're here. -Yeah.

573
00:35:41.522 --> 00:35:43.192
- And I'm...

574
00:35:43.227 --> 00:35:44.589
You guys know each other?

575
00:35:44.624 --> 00:35:46.360
- No. We just met.
- No. I mean. like. we--

576
00:35:46.395 --> 00:35:47.856
- I'm sorry. No. you go ahead.
- Sorry. No. uh. please.

577
00:35:49.695 --> 00:35:51.464
- Uh. I'm Aren. by the way.
- I'm Lizzie.

578
00:35:51.499 --> 00:35:53.928
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

579
00:35:53.963 --> 00:35:55.666
Um. did you get my notes?

580
00:35:55.701 --> 00:36:00.242
No. no. I had to... go to this.
like. HR training and...

581
00:36:00.277 --> 00:36:02.244
That's fine. but we should
get it done tonight

582
00:36:02.279 --> 00:36:04.312
'cause then Masterson
might actually go home.

583
00:36:04.347 --> 00:36:05.775
which at this point is
kind of a human rights thing.

584
00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:07.282
JASON
Right. Yeah. no.

585
00:36:07.317 --> 00:36:09.317
- No. yeah. I'll get it.
- Thank you.

586
00:36:10.617 --> 00:36:12.386
It was nice
to meet you officially.

587
00:36:12.421 --> 00:36:13.618
- Yeah. it's nice to meet you.
- So. I'll see you around.

588
00:36:13.653 --> 00:36:15.455
See ya.

589
00:36:19.527 --> 00:36:21.494
- So. uh. what's her story?
- Lizzie?

590
00:36:21.529 --> 00:36:23.562
She's kind of my work wife.

591
00:36:30.967 --> 00:36:32.802
- You okay?
- I don't know. man.

592
00:36:32.837 --> 00:36:35.970
Like... (sighs) I can't get
this layout to work.

593
00:36:38.315 --> 00:36:40.810
- Hmm.
- What?

594
00:36:40.845 --> 00:36:42.416
Your stroke is
a little hesitant.

595
00:36:42.451 --> 00:36:43.582
I'm sorry?

596
00:36:44.585 --> 00:36:45.716
Your keystroke.

597
00:36:45.751 --> 00:36:47.388
- Oh.
- I mean. yeah.

598
00:36:47.423 --> 00:36:49.522
Yeah. I've--
I don't know what's going on.

599
00:36:49.557 --> 00:36:51.018
I just-- Something's off.

600
00:36:51.053 --> 00:36:52.888
Like. I. uh...

601
00:36:54.023 --> 00:36:55.726
Yeah. you know.
it's like the saying goes.

602
00:36:55.761 --> 00:36:57.959
A man's grip on his...

603
00:36:57.994 --> 00:37:01.336
keyboard is like
his grip on life.

604
00:37:03.538 --> 00:37:06.473
- Who said that?
- Rosa Parks.

605
00:37:07.773 --> 00:37:10.510
- Really? When... was that...
- Yeah. my point is.

606
00:37:10.545 --> 00:37:12.776
something's going on
somewhere else in your life

607
00:37:12.811 --> 00:37:14.877
can show up in your work.

608
00:37:15.979 --> 00:37:18.485
Hmm. -But then again.
you're the boatswain.

609
00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:19.750
- What do I know?
- No. No. you're right. man.

610
00:37:19.785 --> 00:37:20.718
Something's definitely off.

611
00:37:20.753 --> 00:37:22.621
I just feel...

612
00:37:22.656 --> 00:37:23.919
- Feel like what?
- Shaky.

613
00:37:23.954 --> 00:37:25.987
- Mm.
- Like. I'm just not...

614
00:37:26.022 --> 00:37:27.692
You know. like. when
you're trying to do something.

615
00:37:27.727 --> 00:37:29.628
but you lost your keys
and you're like.

616
00:37:29.663 --> 00:37:31.498
"I'm trying to focus.
but where are my keys.

617
00:37:31.533 --> 00:37:32.631
where are my keys. where are
my keys?" -Ah. I feel that.

618
00:37:32.666 --> 00:37:34.501
So. that is not me.

619
00:37:34.536 --> 00:37:35.832
Like. I always know
where my keys are.

620
00:37:35.867 --> 00:37:37.834
They're in a bowl by the door.

621
00:37:37.869 --> 00:37:39.539
Okay.

622
00:37:39.574 --> 00:37:41.343
He's a perfectly fine designer.
but he's. like.

623
00:37:41.378 --> 00:37:42.971
totally convinced
that he's on the fast track.

624
00:37:43.006 --> 00:37:44.742
- Great. What else?
- He responds more to

625
00:37:44.777 --> 00:37:46.447
'90s hip-hop slang
than Uncle Remus.

626
00:37:46.482 --> 00:37:48.449
What about his Want?

627
00:37:48.484 --> 00:37:50.682
I mean. those are all
great observations.

628
00:37:50.717 --> 00:37:52.585
but we need to find out
what he's missing.

629
00:37:53.555 --> 00:37:55.049
Honestly. I'm not sure.

630
00:37:55.084 --> 00:37:58.624
You know. best I can tell
is that. for some reason.

631
00:37:58.659 --> 00:38:01.088
his meter jumped
when his last project launched.

632
00:38:01.123 --> 00:38:03.926
Is he close to anyone at work?

633
00:38:03.961 --> 00:38:05.895
He has a work wife.

634
00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:07.765
So. spend some time with her.

635
00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.371
Get some intel.

636
00:38:09.406 --> 00:38:11.098
With her? Yeah.

637
00:38:11.133 --> 00:38:12.539
Yeah. I could do that.

638
00:38:21.451 --> 00:38:23.451
It's Lizzie. right?

639
00:38:52.713 --> 00:38:54.515
It's really good!

640
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:56.418
It's a shambles. It's terrible.

641
00:38:56.453 --> 00:38:58.013
I feel like if I squint.
I can totally see

642
00:38:58.048 --> 00:39:00.081
- the Chrysler Building.
- Oh.

643
00:39:00.116 --> 00:39:02.457
It's supposed to be
the Empire State Building.

644
00:39:02.492 --> 00:39:04.019
That's what I said.

645
00:39:04.054 --> 00:39:05.658
- the Empire State Building.
- That's not what you said.

646
00:39:05.693 --> 00:39:07.055
Yes. it is.
You didn't hear me. -No.

647
00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:08.991
- Wow.
- What?

648
00:39:09.026 --> 00:39:09.959
There.

649
00:39:09.994 --> 00:39:11.763
You added jumpers?

650
00:39:11.798 --> 00:39:12.995
No. no.

651
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:14.898
They're. like...

652
00:39:14.933 --> 00:39:16.636
They're. like. a couple.

653
00:39:16.671 --> 00:39:18.132
- You know. in the movies.
- Oh.

654
00:39:18.167 --> 00:39:20.068
That's really sweet.

655
00:39:20.103 --> 00:39:22.136
Hey.
Uh. nice. Chrysler Building.

656
00:39:22.171 --> 00:39:24.171
Hell yeah.

657
00:39:24.206 --> 00:39:25.579
Masterson wants you.

658
00:39:25.614 --> 00:39:27.680
Okay.

659
00:39:28.683 --> 00:39:30.111
I will see you. gents.

660
00:39:30.146 --> 00:39:32.487
All right.
- Watch them for me.

661
00:39:32.522 --> 00:39:33.851
You got it.

662
00:39:33.886 --> 00:39:35.523
- Good luck.
See you. guys. Bye.

663
00:39:35.558 --> 00:39:37.624
Yo. who took my tugboat?

664
00:39:40.057 --> 00:39:42.761
Okay.

665
00:39:42.796 --> 00:39:43.993
Wow.

666
00:39:44.963 --> 00:39:46.193
She's great.

667
00:39:46.228 --> 00:39:47.931
- Yeah. she's cool.
- Are you kidding?

668
00:39:47.966 --> 00:39:49.438
Come on. man.

669
00:39:49.473 --> 00:39:52.705
She's-she's smart
and funny and she's--

670
00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:53.970
Have you seen her work?

671
00:39:54.005 --> 00:39:55.609
She's. like.
a ridiculous designer.

672
00:39:55.644 --> 00:39:56.907
Yeah. -She's. like.
the best designer here.

673
00:39:56.942 --> 00:39:59.514
Yeah. she's definitely
the golden child.

674
00:40:02.079 --> 00:40:03.782
You know. th-they're
actually saying that

675
00:40:03.817 --> 00:40:05.212
about you. too.
around the office.

676
00:40:05.247 --> 00:40:06.620
I hear that all the time about

677
00:40:06.655 --> 00:40:08.182
how amazing of a designer
you are.

678
00:40:08.217 --> 00:40:09.722
Thanks. man.

679
00:40:09.757 --> 00:40:11.086
Yeah. y-you guys
are completely different.

680
00:40:11.121 --> 00:40:12.857
You're-you're actually--

681
00:40:12.892 --> 00:40:14.595
You-you work
really well together.

682
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:16.157
- You think?
- Yeah.

683
00:40:16.192 --> 00:40:18.027
It's like you have such talent.
she has such talent.

684
00:40:18.062 --> 00:40:20.865
It's like.
it's like a power couple.

685
00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:22.768
Work-wise. you know.

686
00:40:26.136 --> 00:40:28.070
MeetBox is under fire.

687
00:40:28.105 --> 00:40:31.579
as new complaints emerge its
facial recognition technology

688
00:40:31.614 --> 00:40:33.581
fails to identify Black people.

689
00:40:33.616 --> 00:40:36.914
Critics say a lack of diversity
on the engineering team

690
00:40:36.949 --> 00:40:38.751
may have contributed
to the issue.

691
00:40:38.786 --> 00:40:40.654
And with public pressure
growing.

692
00:40:40.689 --> 00:40:42.689
MeetBox founder
Mick Morton has promised

693
00:40:42.724 --> 00:40:44.053
sweeping internal changes.

694
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.835
- Ahoy. -Ahoy.
- Ahoy.

695
00:40:57.970 --> 00:40:59.508
When I dropped out of Harvard

696
00:40:59.543 --> 00:41:01.576
to build MeetBox
in my parents' garage.

697
00:41:01.611 --> 00:41:03.039
I remember thinking.

698
00:41:03.074 --> 00:41:04.810
"I hope they don't
pull the car in."

699
00:41:09.619 --> 00:41:10.981
I also remember thinking

700
00:41:11.016 --> 00:41:13.753
MeetBox had to be
a platform for everybody.

701
00:41:14.756 --> 00:41:16.756
Now. in the next few days.
you're gonna hear

702
00:41:16.791 --> 00:41:19.660
the media claim
that we have failed at that.

703
00:41:19.695 --> 00:41:22.564
You're gonna hear
outlandish accusations.

704
00:41:22.599 --> 00:41:24.060
"Mick's biased.

705
00:41:24.095 --> 00:41:25.831
"Mick's a racist.

706
00:41:25.866 --> 00:41:28.163
Mick hates
the entire nation of Ghana."

707
00:41:28.198 --> 00:41:29.901
That's not me.

708
00:41:29.936 --> 00:41:32.002
It's not who we are.

709
00:41:32.037 --> 00:41:34.807
We are the same company that.
last quarter alone.

710
00:41:34.842 --> 00:41:37.777
partnered with
22 Black-owned vendors.

711
00:41:37.812 --> 00:41:39.911
We are the same company that.

712
00:41:39.946 --> 00:41:42.144
during the
George Floyd protests.

713
00:41:42.179 --> 00:41:44.179
suspended operations
for 12 hours.

714
00:41:44.214 --> 00:41:46.115
We're the same company

715
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:49.954
whose flagship office
has a world cuisine station

716
00:41:49.989 --> 00:41:51.956
dedicated to the food
of the Caribbean

717
00:41:51.991 --> 00:41:53.628
and occasionally Africa.

718
00:41:53.663 --> 00:41:56.631
It's diverse. it's different.
it's yummy.

719
00:41:56.666 --> 00:41:57.863
We like it.

720
00:41:57.898 --> 00:41:58.930
That's who we are.

721
00:42:03.937 --> 00:42:05.904
But to make it crystal clear
who we are.

722
00:42:05.939 --> 00:42:08.742
I am thrilled to announce
that in the next 30 days.

723
00:42:08.777 --> 00:42:11.140
we are relaunching
the MeetBox brand.

724
00:42:11.175 --> 00:42:12.944
At a company-wide presentation.

725
00:42:12.979 --> 00:42:16.310
our top design team will pitch
a MeetBox makeover.

726
00:42:16.345 --> 00:42:18.279
We're gonna have a new logo.

727
00:42:18.314 --> 00:42:21.282
a new slogan
and a new commitment

728
00:42:21.317 --> 00:42:23.955
to the exact same values
that got us here.

729
00:42:24.958 --> 00:42:27.090
- He's incredible.
- Hmm.

730
00:42:34.198 --> 00:42:37.034
So that's Jason's Want:
to be like Mick.

731
00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:38.299
Mick's a CEO.

732
00:42:38.334 --> 00:42:40.235
That makes Jason
a five-. ten-year client.

733
00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:41.808
And those are different.

734
00:42:41.843 --> 00:42:43.645
Less magic. more listening.

735
00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:46.109
Yeah. it's actually fun
and weirdly relaxing.

736
00:42:46.144 --> 00:42:48.177
It's like being a secret agent
with none of the danger.

737
00:43:05.801 --> 00:43:08.263
So. uh. I actually had
a question for you

738
00:43:08.298 --> 00:43:09.836
about Jason's work wife.

739
00:43:09.871 --> 00:43:11.970
Aren. just ask the girl out.

740
00:43:12.005 --> 00:43:14.005
- Can I?
- We're not monks. Aren.

741
00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:15.941
You're just scared to ask her.

742
00:43:15.976 --> 00:43:18.273
- I'm getting to it. all right?
- When?

743
00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:22.145
Tomorrow.

744
00:43:24.787 --> 00:43:26.149
Okay.

745
00:43:33.763 --> 00:43:34.960
- Dude.
- Whoa.

746
00:43:34.995 --> 00:43:36.060
Thank you.

747
00:43:36.095 --> 00:43:38.161
- You're welcome.
- Seriously. man.

748
00:43:38.196 --> 00:43:39.734
It was like an epiphany.

749
00:43:39.769 --> 00:43:40.999
I can't believe
I didn't see it before.

750
00:43:41.034 --> 00:43:41.967
Sorry. what-what are
we talking about?

751
00:43:42.002 --> 00:43:44.035
Lizzie.

752
00:43:44.070 --> 00:43:46.103
- What?
- Don't play dumb. man.

753
00:43:46.138 --> 00:43:49.073
I know what you were doing.
going on about her.

754
00:43:49.108 --> 00:43:50.943
You were trying to...
you were trying to set us up.

755
00:43:50.978 --> 00:43:52.912
No. No. no. no.
That's not what I was doing.

756
00:43:52.947 --> 00:43:54.342
- I was...
- It's okay. It's cool.

757
00:43:54.377 --> 00:43:56.817
I'm grateful because
you got me thinking.

758
00:43:56.852 --> 00:43:58.819
"Why haven't we
gotten together?"

759
00:43:58.854 --> 00:44:00.183
And then it hit me.

760
00:44:00.218 --> 00:44:01.657
I'm into Lizzie.

761
00:44:04.189 --> 00:44:05.892
Hey. man. you were. um.

762
00:44:05.927 --> 00:44:08.224
you were pretty focused on
being like Mick.

763
00:44:08.259 --> 00:44:10.028
I am.

764
00:44:10.998 --> 00:44:12.459
You want both things?

765
00:44:12.494 --> 00:44:13.933
I do.

766
00:44:13.968 --> 00:44:16.771
- Isn't that cool?
- Yeah.

767
00:44:16.806 --> 00:44:18.872
Clarity is dope. man.

768
00:44:18.907 --> 00:44:20.401
Right.

769
00:44:20.436 --> 00:44:22.909
- He wants both things?
- Yeah. can he even do that?

770
00:44:22.944 --> 00:44:26.880
Yes. but a Double Want is not
ideal for your first client.

771
00:44:26.915 --> 00:44:29.410
Okay. great. well. then
I'm just gonna focus on work

772
00:44:29.445 --> 00:44:32.215
and let him
deal with his love life.

773
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:34.349
You know. the company's
about to do the big rebrand.

774
00:44:34.384 --> 00:44:36.087
- and so I feel like...
- No.

775
00:44:36.122 --> 00:44:38.958
You're going to concentrate on
both things at once.

776
00:44:38.993 --> 00:44:41.125
And. Aren. I hope
I don't have to tell you this.

777
00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:45.393
but you cannot have a romantic
relationship with Lizzie now.

778
00:44:45.428 --> 00:44:48.000
Is that going to be a problem?

779
00:44:48.035 --> 00:44:49.870
Because if you don't
put Jason first.

780
00:44:49.905 --> 00:44:52.070
everyone's magic will fail.

781
00:44:52.105 --> 00:44:55.370
I was hoping that was. like.
a team-building thing.

782
00:44:55.405 --> 00:44:57.141
We're all in this together now.

783
00:44:57.176 --> 00:44:59.209
So you have to set up
Lizzie and Jason.

784
00:44:59.244 --> 00:45:02.718
and I have to drive around
this crotchety old white lady.

785
00:45:11.795 --> 00:45:14.092
Oh. Lizzie texted me.

786
00:45:14.127 --> 00:45:15.126
What should I say?

787
00:45:17.493 --> 00:45:19.493
Let's start with what
she said. -Okay. she said.

788
00:45:19.528 --> 00:45:22.837
"Can I get
that timeline. please?"

789
00:45:22.872 --> 00:45:24.938
What do you think it means?

790
00:45:24.973 --> 00:45:27.369
Hey. You two talking about me?

791
00:45:27.404 --> 00:45:30.042
- Hey.
- What's up? Hey.

792
00:45:31.881 --> 00:45:33.749
Oh. my-- Wait. are you?

793
00:45:34.543 --> 00:45:36.312
Yeah. actually. we were.

794
00:45:36.347 --> 00:45:38.083
We were just. uh. wondering
if you wanted to get a drink

795
00:45:38.118 --> 00:45:40.448
- with us after work. right?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

796
00:45:40.483 --> 00:45:42.923
Oh.

797
00:45:42.958 --> 00:45:44.452
Okay. yeah. That sounds great.

798
00:45:44.487 --> 00:45:47.521
Um. as long as Jason
gets me that timeline.

799
00:45:48.491 --> 00:45:50.227
Yeah. it's-- Yeah. it's chill.

800
00:45:50.262 --> 00:45:52.262
Okay. great.
Let me know about drinks.

801
00:45:52.297 --> 00:45:54.165
All right.

802
00:45:56.334 --> 00:45:58.136
-  Thank you.
- Yeah. you're welcome.

803
00:45:58.171 --> 00:46:01.238
Geez. -I'll just. uh.
I'll make up an excuse

804
00:46:01.273 --> 00:46:03.174
last minute. and then
you guys are all set. -What?

805
00:46:03.209 --> 00:46:04.912
- All right?
- No. no. No. no. no. no.

806
00:46:04.947 --> 00:46:06.375
You... You're coming.

807
00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:09.048
- Why?
- Did you just see me?

808
00:46:09.083 --> 00:46:11.116
"It's chill"?

809
00:46:11.151 --> 00:46:12.183
- Okay.
- I've never said "chill."

810
00:46:12.218 --> 00:46:13.382
All right. yeah. okay. fine.

811
00:46:13.417 --> 00:46:15.549
I'll come for one drink.
all right?

812
00:46:18.092 --> 00:46:20.290
- Should I send the timeline?
- Yeah. send it now.

813
00:46:20.325 --> 00:46:22.028
Send it? -You should
probably send it now.

814
00:46:23.262 --> 00:46:25.592
<i>So Jason and I
worked on it for a week.</i>

815
00:46:25.627 --> 00:46:27.330
and then... -Yeah. and then...
and then Masterson

816
00:46:27.365 --> 00:46:28.837
fell asleep
right in front of me.

817
00:46:28.872 --> 00:46:30.333
-  Oh. my God.

818
00:46:30.368 --> 00:46:32.203
That's pretty funny.

819
00:46:32.238 --> 00:46:33.974
Your stories are
getting better.

820
00:46:34.009 --> 00:46:35.536
- It was good. right?
- Yeah. it's good.

821
00:46:35.571 --> 00:46:37.142
- I'm getting funnier.
- You're making my job easier.

822
00:46:37.177 --> 00:46:39.375
- Maybe.
- Yeah.

823
00:46:44.085 --> 00:46:45.381
Should we do another round?

824
00:46:45.416 --> 00:46:46.613
- Should we do one more?
- Yeah. -Yeah.

825
00:46:46.648 --> 00:46:49.220
- Yeah. let's do it.
- Yeah? Okay.

826
00:46:49.255 --> 00:46:50.617
- No. I got it.
- You got it?

827
00:46:50.652 --> 00:46:52.388
- All right. thank you.
- Thank you.

828
00:46:52.423 --> 00:46:54.522
ANCHOR
...country music superstar.

829
00:46:54.557 --> 00:46:56.161
In other news. the fallout from

830
00:46:56.196 --> 00:46:59.065
MeetBox's facial recognition
scandal continues.

831
00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:01.034
The technology required

832
00:47:01.069 --> 00:47:02.431
to access the platform
has prevented

833
00:47:02.466 --> 00:47:04.972
the entire nation of Ghana
from logging on

834
00:47:05.007 --> 00:47:06.600
for several days.

835
00:47:06.635 --> 00:47:08.140
Well. on the one hand.

836
00:47:08.175 --> 00:47:10.637
it's been great for
my productivity at work.

837
00:47:10.672 --> 00:47:12.980
But on the other hand.
it was quite racist.

838
00:47:13.015 --> 00:47:15.180
The growing outcry
made its way to social media.

839
00:47:15.215 --> 00:47:17.611
where the hashtag "Ghanagate"
has been trending...

840
00:47:17.646 --> 00:47:20.955
I'm so sick of this. this whole
facial recognition thing.

841
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:22.187
God. I know.

842
00:47:22.222 --> 00:47:24.552
It was a mistake.

843
00:47:24.587 --> 00:47:27.324
Oh. no. I meant. like. I'm
just so sick of thinking about

844
00:47:27.359 --> 00:47:31.262
how we all work for these
people who are responsible.

845
00:47:31.297 --> 00:47:35.299
So what? So everybody who was
on that team is a bad person?

846
00:47:35.334 --> 00:47:37.202
- I didn't say that. Um...

847
00:47:37.237 --> 00:47:39.336
Wait. did you--
Was that your last project?

848
00:47:39.371 --> 00:47:41.404
Uh. yeah. yeah.

849
00:47:43.947 --> 00:47:46.376
And we were doing our best.
you know. and...

850
00:47:46.411 --> 00:47:49.346
I'm-I'm sorry.
I forgot that you were on that.

851
00:47:49.381 --> 00:47:51.920
- No. it's... I don't care.
Yeah.

852
00:47:51.955 --> 00:47:53.251
I was just
blowing off steam about...

853
00:47:53.286 --> 00:47:54.450
People are being
really sensitive right now.

854
00:47:54.485 --> 00:47:55.451
You know.
it's a hot-button issue

855
00:47:55.486 --> 00:47:56.958
- right now.
- Yeah.

856
00:47:56.993 --> 00:47:58.157
That's totally
what I was commenting on.

857
00:47:58.192 --> 00:47:59.389
- Right.
- You're not a bad person.

858
00:47:59.424 --> 00:48:02.062
- Oh. not at all.
- Right. Right. Yeah. no.

859
00:48:02.097 --> 00:48:04.130
- I'm sorry.
- No. it's fine. it's fine.

860
00:48:04.165 --> 00:48:06.165
But. yeah. thank you.

861
00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:07.496
You're good.

862
00:48:07.531 --> 00:48:10.070
And. look. I mean.
would it have helped

863
00:48:10.105 --> 00:48:13.370
to have people of color
on the team?

864
00:48:13.405 --> 00:48:14.943
Maybe. Yeah.

865
00:48:14.978 --> 00:48:16.703
But...

866
00:48:16.738 --> 00:48:18.243
you know. it was
a really competitive project.

867
00:48:18.278 --> 00:48:19.640
and no people like you made it.

868
00:48:19.675 --> 00:48:22.511
so I don't know
what they want me to do.

869
00:48:26.682 --> 00:48:29.485
I think. uh. you shouldn't
beat yourself up over it.

870
00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:32.323
- Yeah. Exactly.
- That's the main thing.

871
00:48:32.358 --> 00:48:33.357
Yeah.

872
00:48:33.392 --> 00:48:35.062
Right.

873
00:48:35.097 --> 00:48:36.492
And I'm not.

874
00:48:36.527 --> 00:48:39.330
Like. I thought about it
for a few minutes

875
00:48:39.365 --> 00:48:40.628
I'm moving on.

876
00:48:40.663 --> 00:48:42.531
Cause you can't--
you cannot slow down

877
00:48:42.566 --> 00:48:44.170
and listen to the haters and...

878
00:48:51.443 --> 00:48:53.377
What?

879
00:48:53.412 --> 00:48:54.983
No. I should've said something.

880
00:48:55.018 --> 00:48:56.314
You did.

881
00:48:56.349 --> 00:48:58.316
You-you said exactly
what I was thinking

882
00:48:58.351 --> 00:49:00.186
- about the whole scandal.
- Yeah. and then

883
00:49:00.221 --> 00:49:04.586
Jason got all guilty. and I
just. like. completely bailed.

884
00:49:04.621 --> 00:49:05.994
I'm so stupid.

885
00:49:06.029 --> 00:49:07.721
No. don't... it's...

886
00:49:07.756 --> 00:49:10.163
You were trying to make him
feel better. you know.

887
00:49:10.198 --> 00:49:11.626
We both were.

888
00:49:11.661 --> 00:49:14.035
Yeah. well. now I feel worse.

889
00:49:14.070 --> 00:49:15.597
I mean. don't you?

890
00:49:15.632 --> 00:49:18.633
It's okay to...
pick your battles.

891
00:49:18.668 --> 00:49:21.009
That's the thing. I feel like
I'm not really picking.

892
00:49:21.044 --> 00:49:24.441
It just feels like this reflex.

893
00:49:25.576 --> 00:49:27.279
Okay. that doesn't make sense.

894
00:49:27.314 --> 00:49:28.676
No. actually that makes
perfect sense.

895
00:49:28.711 --> 00:49:31.712
It's like when...
when someone sneezes.

896
00:49:31.747 --> 00:49:34.451
how you say "Bless you"
without even thinking.

897
00:49:34.486 --> 00:49:36.354
Only then you look up
afterwards.

898
00:49:36.389 --> 00:49:39.258
and you're like. "What did I...
What did I just bless?"

899
00:49:39.293 --> 00:49:40.556
- Yeah.
- Right.

900
00:49:40.591 --> 00:49:42.789
Yeah.

901
00:49:42.824 --> 00:49:44.461
I don't know.

902
00:49:44.496 --> 00:49:46.760
It's-it's one thing
to not stand up for myself.

903
00:49:46.795 --> 00:49:50.104
but then when
I-I look over and I see

904
00:49:50.139 --> 00:49:53.140
that you're uncomfortable. too.
it's just...

905
00:49:55.804 --> 00:49:58.343
I should've said something.

906
00:50:01.315 --> 00:50:03.645
Thank you... for saying that.

907
00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:06.582
That's-that's really...

908
00:50:06.617 --> 00:50:07.682
That's really nice.

909
00:50:07.717 --> 00:50:09.255
I don't have a lot of people

910
00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:11.389
that stick up for me. so...

911
00:50:13.657 --> 00:50:15.162
Well. I didn't
stick up for you.

912
00:50:15.197 --> 00:50:17.065
I just thought about it.

913
00:50:24.206 --> 00:50:26.074
Well. Lizzie pulled me
aside this morning

914
00:50:26.109 --> 00:50:28.142
and was rehashing
our conversation at the bar.

915
00:50:28.177 --> 00:50:31.079
and apparently I upset her.

916
00:50:31.114 --> 00:50:32.707
- Wait. what?
- I know.

917
00:50:32.742 --> 00:50:35.512
But you weren't upset. right?

918
00:50:35.547 --> 00:50:36.744
No. no.

919
00:50:36.779 --> 00:50:38.218
Good.

920
00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:41.518
- Wow.
- Right?

921
00:50:41.553 --> 00:50:43.388
Cause I obviously care
very deeply

922
00:50:43.423 --> 00:50:47.161
about this stuff. and I take it
really seriously. but...

923
00:50:47.196 --> 00:50:50.395
Honestly. I didn't even know
she was. like. ethnic at first.

924
00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:53.827
So. like. don't come at me
when you're...

925
00:50:53.862 --> 00:50:55.334
you're me.

926
00:50:56.304 --> 00:50:57.468
You know?

927
00:50:59.703 --> 00:51:00.834
You gonna serve?

928
00:51:00.869 --> 00:51:02.803
Uh. yeah. Sorry.

929
00:51:04.807 --> 00:51:07.610
Um. are you and Lizzie
good. though?

930
00:51:07.645 --> 00:51:08.809
Oh. yeah.
I mean. she was basically

931
00:51:08.844 --> 00:51:10.283
flirting with me
by the end of it.

932
00:51:10.318 --> 00:51:11.812
Oh. yeah?

933
00:51:11.847 --> 00:51:13.880
Yeah. she does this thing
where she. like.

934
00:51:13.915 --> 00:51:15.156
touches my arm and...

935
00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:18.324
- Easy.
- Sorry.

936
00:51:18.359 --> 00:51:19.523
It's. uh...

937
00:51:19.558 --> 00:51:21.360
You got any more balls?

938
00:51:21.395 --> 00:51:22.493
- Yeah. I got one.
- Okay.

939
00:51:22.528 --> 00:51:23.758
<i>Our society began</i>

940
00:51:23.793 --> 00:51:25.595
<i>as an informal commitment</i>

941
00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:28.202
amongst Monticello slaves

942
00:51:28.237 --> 00:51:31.634
to help each other avoid
harsh punishment.

943
00:51:31.669 --> 00:51:34.802
Now that I can see
white discomfort everywhere.

944
00:51:34.837 --> 00:51:37.145
I'm starting to realize

945
00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:39.708
all of this stuff
that it does to me.

946
00:51:39.743 --> 00:51:42.216
Like. I apologize all the time.

947
00:51:42.251 --> 00:51:44.482
- You really should hear this.
- Oh. sorry.

948
00:51:44.517 --> 00:51:46.154
See?

949
00:51:46.189 --> 00:51:49.421
And you were so right about

950
00:51:49.456 --> 00:51:52.193
how I've been aware of this
my whole life.

951
00:51:52.228 --> 00:51:56.527
Like. I was never really able
to explain my sculpture before.

952
00:51:56.562 --> 00:51:59.167
but I-I think it's about...

953
00:51:59.202 --> 00:52:00.300
Roger?

954
00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:03.600
R-Roger?

955
00:52:03.635 --> 00:52:05.338
Am I making sense?

956
00:52:05.373 --> 00:52:08.506
You haven't been making sense
for quite some time.

957
00:52:10.312 --> 00:52:11.806
Sorry.

958
00:52:15.383 --> 00:52:17.350
Lizzie. your...

959
00:52:17.385 --> 00:52:20.683
your work on the logo
has been just...

960
00:52:20.718 --> 00:52:22.652
- just great.
- Aw.

961
00:52:22.687 --> 00:52:24.489
I mean. it was
a team effort. I...

962
00:52:24.524 --> 00:52:27.789
Well. I know that you did
all the heavy lifting. so...

963
00:52:28.957 --> 00:52:30.363
- I do.
- Thank you.

964
00:52:30.398 --> 00:52:32.662
- Yeah.
- Aw.

965
00:52:32.697 --> 00:52:35.335
I just want you to know
how great you are.

966
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:37.766
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yeah.

967
00:52:37.801 --> 00:52:39.768
It's just. um...

968
00:52:39.803 --> 00:52:43.706
our team is gonna be pitching
the logo to Mick himself.

969
00:52:43.741 --> 00:52:45.576
- Mm-hmm.
- And I'm gonna ask...

970
00:52:45.611 --> 00:52:48.414
I'm gonna ask Jason to do it.

971
00:52:49.582 --> 00:52:50.977
But it's...

972
00:52:51.012 --> 00:52:53.419
I'm sorry. that's my. um.
design. though. you know.

973
00:52:53.454 --> 00:52:54.684
No. I know.

974
00:52:54.719 --> 00:52:56.752
Uh. Jason's just better
in a room. and--

975
00:52:56.787 --> 00:52:58.655
- He's great in a room.
- Um. is he?

976
00:52:58.690 --> 00:53:00.954
- He's so charismatic and...
- He's loud and he's...

977
00:53:00.989 --> 00:53:03.858
Well. it's a loud...
company. Lizzie.

978
00:53:05.466 --> 00:53:07.631
Sorry. I just feel like
I've been. I've been asking you

979
00:53:07.666 --> 00:53:09.831
for something like this
for a long time. -Mm-hmm. Sure.

980
00:53:09.866 --> 00:53:13.274
And we... we talked about this
in my review. -Sure.

981
00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:14.836
This particular design
means a lot to me. and...

982
00:53:14.871 --> 00:53:18.510
Okay. well. I'm up for
Rear Admiral this year.

983
00:53:18.545 --> 00:53:20.545
No. Lizzie. Rear Admiral.

984
00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:22.613
- Okay. yeah. um...
- And we should just really

985
00:53:22.648 --> 00:53:23.977
support each other right now.

986
00:53:25.013 --> 00:53:27.013
- Yeah. so...
- I heard about that.

987
00:53:27.048 --> 00:53:28.784
That's great.

988
00:53:28.819 --> 00:53:30.555
It's a big presentation.

989
00:53:30.590 --> 00:53:33.657
and Jason's just a better fit
for this audience.

990
00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:40.565
- You'll be fine.
- No. that's okay. Um...

991
00:53:49.543 --> 00:53:51.312
Oh. Masterson's calling me in.

992
00:53:51.347 --> 00:53:52.973
I'll meet you
and Lizzie at the bar.

993
00:53:53.008 --> 00:53:54.546
All right.

994
00:54:04.789 --> 00:54:06.327
Hey.

995
00:54:06.362 --> 00:54:09.528
I'm sorry. I-I actually--
I have to head home.

996
00:54:09.563 --> 00:54:10.826
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

997
00:54:10.861 --> 00:54:12.366
- You okay?
- Yeah.

998
00:54:12.401 --> 00:54:14.764
- Oh.
- Shit. um...

999
00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:22.002
Thank you.

1000
00:54:25.007 --> 00:54:27.843
Look. um. we don't
have to go to the bar.

1001
00:54:27.878 --> 00:54:31.352
We can just walk
in that direction and talk.

1002
00:54:32.949 --> 00:54:36.885
Sorry. I'm just-- I'm not
super. uh. fun right now.

1003
00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:38.425
It's okay.

1004
00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:39.789
No. I'm really. uh...

1005
00:54:39.824 --> 00:54:41.659
I'm no fun.

1006
00:54:42.794 --> 00:54:46.730
I think. uh. this is fun enough
for the both of us.

1007
00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:48.864
Oh. my God.

1008
00:54:48.899 --> 00:54:50.800
Is this a ring that says
"So swag"?

1009
00:54:50.835 --> 00:54:52.340
Okay. you love that.

1010
00:54:52.375 --> 00:54:54.001
- It's very fun.
- That was a gag gift.

1011
00:54:54.036 --> 00:54:55.970
- So...
- It's almost too fun.

1012
00:54:57.446 --> 00:54:59.347
-"So swag."
- Okay.

1013
00:54:59.382 --> 00:55:00.942
Um...

1014
00:55:00.977 --> 00:55:04.517
A short. un-fun walk?

1015
00:55:04.552 --> 00:55:07.014
All right.

1016
00:55:07.049 --> 00:55:09.423
Completely joyless.

1017
00:55:09.458 --> 00:55:11.425
<i>It's my job to support Jason.</i>

1018
00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:12.888
in more ways
than you can imagine.

1019
00:55:12.923 --> 00:55:14.120
but. I mean. I don't know.

1020
00:55:14.155 --> 00:55:15.990
I think
I'm a good designer also.

1021
00:55:16.025 --> 00:55:18.366
You're the best of us.
-  I mean. I don't.

1022
00:55:18.401 --> 00:55:20.027
I don't know if I'm the best.
but. like... -No. you are.

1023
00:55:20.062 --> 00:55:21.765
I went to RISD
with some great designers.

1024
00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:23.063
- and you're killing it.
- Thank you.

1025
00:55:23.098 --> 00:55:24.933
- I mean that.
- That means a lot.

1026
00:55:24.968 --> 00:55:27.408
Thank you. I...

1027
00:55:27.443 --> 00:55:30.444
Like. if I'm being honest.
I kind of...

1028
00:55:30.479 --> 00:55:32.710
I kind of think that. too.

1029
00:55:32.745 --> 00:55:34.811
And that's. like.
this whole thing for me.

1030
00:55:34.846 --> 00:55:38.584
Like. it's taken me years
to just be able to say. like.

1031
00:55:38.619 --> 00:55:40.982
you know. "I think.
like. I. as a person.

1032
00:55:41.017 --> 00:55:43.589
do not suck fundamentally."

1033
00:55:43.624 --> 00:55:45.624
And it's...

1034
00:55:45.659 --> 00:55:49.430
This place is supposed
to be a meritocracy. so...

1035
00:55:49.465 --> 00:55:51.696
Mick? Like. Mick is
a free market psychopath.

1036
00:55:51.731 --> 00:55:54.435
If there was a way to promote
with blood sport.

1037
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:56.030
oh. my God. he'd be
throwing us in the pit.

1038
00:55:56.065 --> 00:55:57.669
- like. left and right.

1039
00:55:57.704 --> 00:55:59.473
And I'm just saying.
"Put me in the pit.

1040
00:55:59.508 --> 00:56:00.672
- Like. I'm there."
- Yeah.

1041
00:56:00.707 --> 00:56:02.806
"I'm committed.
I'm-I'm good."

1042
00:56:02.841 --> 00:56:06.106
Can I just say.
you're kind of a badass...

1043
00:56:06.141 --> 00:56:07.481
right now.

1044
00:56:07.516 --> 00:56:08.845
I mean. at all times.

1045
00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:10.418
- but specifically right now...
- Thank you.

1046
00:56:10.453 --> 00:56:11.980
...because I feel like--
I keep thinking this

1047
00:56:12.015 --> 00:56:13.850
because. uh. with me.
when I lose an opportunity.

1048
00:56:13.885 --> 00:56:15.819
I'm like. "Yeah. that's right.
That makes sense.

1049
00:56:15.854 --> 00:56:17.458
And goodbye
and thank you so much."

1050
00:56:17.493 --> 00:56:20.087
And you're-- right now.
you're. like... -Wait.

1051
00:56:20.122 --> 00:56:21.693
This...

1052
00:56:21.728 --> 00:56:22.793
I don't even have the word
for it. -But why?

1053
00:56:22.828 --> 00:56:23.794
That how much I don't have it.

1054
00:56:23.829 --> 00:56:25.158
You went to RISD. I mean...

1055
00:56:25.193 --> 00:56:27.127
- That's different.
- No. it's not at all.

1056
00:56:27.162 --> 00:56:29.162
That's like the Harvard
of finger painting.

1057
00:56:29.197 --> 00:56:31.032
That's how they sell it.
It's on all the pamphlets.

1058
00:56:31.067 --> 00:56:33.034
- Exactly. I mean. it's...

1059
00:56:33.069 --> 00:56:36.202
Yeah. it's amazing
to even get in there.

1060
00:56:36.237 --> 00:56:39.205
- What did you study?
- Sculpture.

1061
00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:41.515
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

1062
00:56:41.550 --> 00:56:43.176
You still do it?

1063
00:56:43.211 --> 00:56:45.816
No. Not really. um. anymore.

1064
00:56:45.851 --> 00:56:46.717
I. uh...

1065
00:56:48.689 --> 00:56:50.623
I used to love it.
but it's sort of similar

1066
00:56:50.658 --> 00:56:52.119
- to what you were saying.
- What?

1067
00:56:52.154 --> 00:56:55.496
I couldn't decide if I was.
like. really good

1068
00:56:55.531 --> 00:56:58.565
and other people didn't get me
or if I was. like.

1069
00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:02.503
a lunatic
making yarn sculptures.

1070
00:57:02.538 --> 00:57:04.802
- Yarn sculptures?
- I know. I know.

1071
00:57:04.837 --> 00:57:07.101
Sculptures with yarn?

1072
00:57:07.136 --> 00:57:09.642
- Yeah.
- Do you have pictures?

1073
00:57:10.711 --> 00:57:12.876
- I do.
- Yeah?

1074
00:57:12.911 --> 00:57:14.746
Um...

1075
00:57:17.212 --> 00:57:19.212
- They don't really work in 2D.
- Oh. my God.

1076
00:57:19.247 --> 00:57:22.248
And they're too small
on this screen. -Are you sure?

1077
00:57:22.283 --> 00:57:24.591
- Let me see.
- Come on!

1078
00:57:38.607 --> 00:57:40.266
This looks so cool.

1079
00:57:40.301 --> 00:57:43.544
Yeah. you don't really get the
feeling that you get in person.

1080
00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:47.614
Uh. okay. so if it was. like.
right in front of me.

1081
00:57:47.649 --> 00:57:49.616
what would I be feeling?

1082
00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:54.148
Calm.

1083
00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:56.755
Quiet.

1084
00:57:57.956 --> 00:58:00.759
Kind of like how I imagine
meditating is supposed to feel

1085
00:58:00.794 --> 00:58:02.222
but you can never
actually pull off.

1086
00:58:02.257 --> 00:58:04.961
Okay. so it's-it's.
like. relaxing?

1087
00:58:04.996 --> 00:58:06.897
I'm doing a terrible job
of this.

1088
00:58:06.932 --> 00:58:08.932
- Why are you making me do this?
- No. you're not.

1089
00:58:08.967 --> 00:58:11.506
- You're not.

1090
00:58:12.641 --> 00:58:13.937
Yeah. um...

1091
00:58:15.138 --> 00:58:18.040
I think my pieces are about...

1092
00:58:18.075 --> 00:58:20.207
comfort.

1093
00:58:20.242 --> 00:58:21.582
Mm-hmm.

1094
00:58:21.617 --> 00:58:23.144
Not like my shoes
are comfortable.

1095
00:58:23.179 --> 00:58:26.719
but deep social ease.

1096
00:58:28.052 --> 00:58:31.658
Like. I saw this Wall Street
bro get mugged one time.

1097
00:58:31.693 --> 00:58:33.825
- Uh. okay.
- It's an example.

1098
00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:35.794
- Okay. Okay.
- Deep social ease.

1099
00:58:35.829 --> 00:58:38.764
Uh. but when this guy
got mugged.

1100
00:58:38.799 --> 00:58:42.603
he was so surprised.

1101
00:58:43.903 --> 00:58:46.167
Yeah. I mean. isn't that
kind of essential to a mugging?

1102
00:58:46.202 --> 00:58:48.202
But no. it was the way
he was surprised.

1103
00:58:48.237 --> 00:58:49.577
It was...

1104
00:58:49.612 --> 00:58:51.205
Like. right before the mugging.

1105
00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:54.747
he was so sure that the world
wasn't gonna come for him

1106
00:58:54.782 --> 00:58:56.848
that it took him
a super long time to realize

1107
00:58:56.883 --> 00:58:58.586
that he was getting mugged.

1108
00:58:58.621 --> 00:59:00.951
I swear to God
that for a split second.

1109
00:59:00.986 --> 00:59:03.085
he thought the knife
was a present for him.

1110
00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:08.156
Like. in his mind. it was
more likely that a stranger

1111
00:59:08.191 --> 00:59:11.632
would give him
a random gift...

1112
00:59:11.667 --> 00:59:14.701
than that they would
try to hurt him.

1113
00:59:14.736 --> 00:59:17.132
Totally. Yeah.

1114
00:59:17.167 --> 00:59:21.004
And I-I want to know
what that would feel like

1115
00:59:21.039 --> 00:59:24.073
to have that expectation
of the world.

1116
00:59:25.813 --> 00:59:27.582
Just for a second.

1117
00:59:29.245 --> 00:59:31.751
Like I'm...

1118
00:59:31.786 --> 00:59:33.379
floating in salt water.

1119
00:59:33.414 --> 00:59:37.823
and I can just relax.

1120
00:59:42.995 --> 00:59:45.061
Well. what makes you
feel like that?

1121
00:59:49.837 --> 00:59:51.672
Peruvian wool.

1122
00:59:55.172 --> 00:59:57.271
And...

1123
00:59:57.306 --> 01:00:00.340
when people are talking to me.

1124
01:00:00.375 --> 01:00:03.717
- Like. me specifically.
- Mm.

1125
01:00:03.752 --> 01:00:08.381
Not an idea of me but
the person that I actually am.

1126
01:00:11.694 --> 01:00:13.721
And when does that happen?

1127
01:00:16.798 --> 01:00:18.996
Is it weird to say now?

1128
01:00:32.946 --> 01:00:34.176
Sorry.

1129
01:00:35.718 --> 01:00:37.113
Hey. -JASON
You sitting down?

1130
01:00:37.148 --> 01:00:38.312
I was.

1131
01:00:38.347 --> 01:00:39.852
Dude. I get to pitch Mick

1132
01:00:39.887 --> 01:00:42.382
in front of the entire company. everyone.

1133
01:00:42.417 --> 01:00:44.989
- That's awesome. man.
- Like. I knew it was coming.

1134
01:00:45.024 --> 01:00:46.452
and this is it. it's here.

1135
01:00:46.487 --> 01:00:48.322
and I'm bringing you
along with me.

1136
01:00:48.357 --> 01:00:50.423
And I just emailed you a temp.
so you think you can. like.

1137
01:00:50.458 --> 01:00:52.326
work your magic
like you did last time?

1138
01:00:52.361 --> 01:00:54.394
Yeah. You got it. No problem.

1139
01:00:54.429 --> 01:00:55.703
Thanks. man.

1140
01:01:00.908 --> 01:01:03.304
Sorry. I've got to go back
to work.

1141
01:01:05.176 --> 01:01:07.407
That's okay.
I should actually...

1142
01:01:07.442 --> 01:01:09.211
I should go. so...

1143
01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:13.952
Thanks for the walk.

1144
01:01:15.054 --> 01:01:16.185
Yeah. anytime.

1145
01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:18.088
- I'll see ya.
- See ya.

1146
01:01:30.872 --> 01:01:34.269
A farm subsidy's not welfare
because farmers aren't lazy.

1147
01:01:34.304 --> 01:01:36.040
- You know?

1148
01:01:45.282 --> 01:01:49.383
And that's why you have nothing
to be embarrassed about.

1149
01:02:35.167 --> 01:02:39.004
Normally. I would be
floating above you. godlike.

1150
01:02:39.039 --> 01:02:43.536
with magic powered by a hundred
Negroes working as one.

1151
01:02:43.571 --> 01:02:48.277
But today. Kyle here had to get
an actual chair for me.

1152
01:02:48.312 --> 01:02:51.885
Why? Because someone here
defied the Society.

1153
01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:55.152
Our powers shut down
because someone here

1154
01:02:55.187 --> 01:02:57.121
made it about himself.

1155
01:02:57.156 --> 01:02:58.991
- Who was it?

1156
01:02:59.026 --> 01:03:04.590
Brutus and Kyle have
had to carry this thing around

1157
01:03:04.625 --> 01:03:07.329
like common laborers.

1158
01:03:07.364 --> 01:03:10.266
Brutus went to Dartmouth.

1159
01:03:10.301 --> 01:03:12.169
He doesn't need this shit.

1160
01:03:12.204 --> 01:03:15.370
And Kyle went to...

1161
01:03:15.405 --> 01:03:18.373
Kyle?
Baby. where'd you go again?

1162
01:03:18.408 --> 01:03:20.309
Cornell. ma'am.

1163
01:03:20.344 --> 01:03:24.082
Still technically Ivy.

1164
01:03:24.117 --> 01:03:26.447
Who did it?

1165
01:03:28.550 --> 01:03:30.583
Tonya?

1166
01:03:30.618 --> 01:03:32.552
Tell us of your crimes.

1167
01:03:33.995 --> 01:03:36.424
I told my client about himself.

1168
01:03:38.164 --> 01:03:39.559
Not much.

1169
01:03:39.594 --> 01:03:43.266
It was just like.
"Hey. you may want to revisit

1170
01:03:43.301 --> 01:03:45.367
that foundational paper
in our field."

1171
01:03:45.402 --> 01:03:47.336
Was that all?

1172
01:03:47.371 --> 01:03:49.943
And I may have sworn at him
a little.

1173
01:03:49.978 --> 01:03:52.044
- He's never read it.

1174
01:03:52.079 --> 01:03:54.178
He cites it.
but he's never read it.

1175
01:03:54.213 --> 01:03:55.982
I've heard enough!

1176
01:03:56.017 --> 01:03:57.951
I hereby ban you

1177
01:03:57.986 --> 01:04:00.954
from the American Society
of Magical Negroes.

1178
01:04:00.989 --> 01:04:03.253
You will receive
a mind-erasing spell

1179
01:04:03.288 --> 01:04:06.355
that will take away any and all
recollection of your time here.

1180
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:08.621
And then. Tonya.

1181
01:04:08.656 --> 01:04:13.032
you will receive
the most severe sentence.

1182
01:04:13.067 --> 01:04:16.167
You will be forced to live
in America...

1183
01:04:16.202 --> 01:04:17.399
No.

1184
01:04:17.434 --> 01:04:19.005
...as a...

1185
01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:21.205
regular Black person.

1186
01:04:25.607 --> 01:04:27.475
We're working to get our powers
up as soon as possible.

1187
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:29.180
Normally. Tonya would have
helped with that.

1188
01:04:29.215 --> 01:04:31.919
What a waste.

1189
01:04:31.954 --> 01:04:33.921
To Tonya.

1190
01:04:33.956 --> 01:04:36.220
She is...

1191
01:04:36.255 --> 01:04:37.991
was...

1192
01:04:38.026 --> 01:04:40.158
the smartest of us.

1193
01:04:40.193 --> 01:04:43.161
- She's not dead. though. right?
- Probably not.

1194
01:04:43.196 --> 01:04:45.658
But without our standard-issue
charm against hate crimes.

1195
01:04:45.693 --> 01:04:47.198
the worst could've happened.

1196
01:04:47.233 --> 01:04:49.266
Like she stepped
out of our door

1197
01:04:49.301 --> 01:04:51.972
and walked
straight into a Nazi.

1198
01:04:58.013 --> 01:05:00.343
I didn't mean to put you off
like that.

1199
01:05:00.378 --> 01:05:01.982
No. no. it's...

1200
01:05:02.017 --> 01:05:04.050
I don't recruit.

1201
01:05:04.085 --> 01:05:07.515
Usually. I don't work
with the new members like that.

1202
01:05:07.550 --> 01:05:09.583
Really?

1203
01:05:09.618 --> 01:05:12.355
Dede says I'm too stern.

1204
01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:14.357
- What?

1205
01:05:14.392 --> 01:05:17.393
That's what I said.
I'm likeable.

1206
01:05:17.428 --> 01:05:20.429
So. uh. why me?

1207
01:05:20.464 --> 01:05:22.266
I'll give you a compliment.

1208
01:05:22.301 --> 01:05:24.972
Watching you walk through
a room full of white people

1209
01:05:25.007 --> 01:05:26.732
is the most painful thing
I've ever seen.

1210
01:05:26.767 --> 01:05:29.273
Mm. thank you.

1211
01:05:29.308 --> 01:05:31.440
I called Dede right away
and said.

1212
01:05:31.475 --> 01:05:34.542
"I'm going to work
with this young man myself."

1213
01:05:36.216 --> 01:05:40.317
You know. uh. I just realized
I never actually. uh.

1214
01:05:40.352 --> 01:05:42.385
thanked you for helping me out
that night.

1215
01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:44.486
You don't have to thank me.

1216
01:05:46.193 --> 01:05:47.687
Still.

1217
01:05:48.690 --> 01:05:51.262
You can thank me
by doing a good job.

1218
01:05:56.698 --> 01:05:58.533
Okay.

1219
01:06:02.242 --> 01:06:04.242
Hey.
- Hi.

1220
01:06:05.509 --> 01:06:07.245
Is everything okay?

1221
01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:09.247
Yeah.

1222
01:06:09.282 --> 01:06:10.512
I mean. I was not okay
last night.

1223
01:06:10.547 --> 01:06:12.448
and you were really sweet
about it.

1224
01:06:12.483 --> 01:06:14.252
So it's your turn.

1225
01:06:15.255 --> 01:06:16.551
- Yeah. I'm good.
- Okay.

1226
01:06:28.730 --> 01:06:30.301
I can't believe
you haven't played this before.

1227
01:06:30.336 --> 01:06:31.698
Yeah. I know. It's-it's fun.

1228
01:06:31.733 --> 01:06:33.469
- Oh. my God.

1229
01:06:33.504 --> 01:06:34.800
- I know. right?
- Wow.

1230
01:06:34.835 --> 01:06:37.143
Look. he's. like.
all burned up.

1231
01:06:37.178 --> 01:06:40.245
You can. like. pick up
his lung. -Okay. yeah. let's...

1232
01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:43.314
Hey. actually. um...
I actually had a suggestion

1233
01:06:43.349 --> 01:06:45.250
on the Lizzie front.

1234
01:06:45.285 --> 01:06:47.252
Yeah. shoot.
I was thinking

1235
01:06:47.287 --> 01:06:49.584
that you could ask Lizzie
to present with you.

1236
01:06:51.126 --> 01:06:53.687
Why? I mean. I do the talking.
you run the deck.

1237
01:06:53.722 --> 01:06:54.820
What else do we need?

1238
01:06:54.855 --> 01:06:56.294
Well. Lizzie's
a great designer.

1239
01:06:56.329 --> 01:06:57.592
and. you know.
it's a nice gesture.

1240
01:06:57.627 --> 01:06:59.165
especially for someone
that you're into.

1241
01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.793
Yeah. but it's not fair.

1242
01:07:00.828 --> 01:07:02.498
No.

1243
01:07:02.533 --> 01:07:04.665
You'd still have plenty
of face time with Mick.

1244
01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:06.832
No. it's-- I mean.
it's not fair to Lizzie.

1245
01:07:06.867 --> 01:07:08.669
What-- I-I don't follow.

1246
01:07:08.704 --> 01:07:10.539
Well. I mean.
if you give somebody a break

1247
01:07:10.574 --> 01:07:12.277
and they haven't earned it.

1248
01:07:12.312 --> 01:07:14.279
you're just setting them up
to fail down the line.

1249
01:07:14.314 --> 01:07:16.215
so it's not fair to them.

1250
01:07:16.250 --> 01:07:19.416
So you don't think
Lizzie's earned it?

1251
01:07:19.451 --> 01:07:22.650
Well. I mean.
Masterson did come to me. so...

1252
01:07:22.685 --> 01:07:25.455
Yeah. true. but it could've
been either of you.

1253
01:07:25.490 --> 01:07:27.787
- Could it?
- Yeah.

1254
01:07:27.822 --> 01:07:30.196
Well. I mean. I can only
speak for me. and I got it.

1255
01:07:30.231 --> 01:07:31.857
so I must have put in
the right amount of work.

1256
01:07:31.892 --> 01:07:34.860
Well. what if Lizzie put in
the exact same amount of work?

1257
01:07:34.895 --> 01:07:36.730
But she didn't get it.

1258
01:07:36.765 --> 01:07:38.501
So the fact that you have it
is proof that you deserve it?

1259
01:07:38.536 --> 01:07:39.502
Kinda.

1260
01:07:39.537 --> 01:07:41.207
Pick up that rapier there

1261
01:07:41.242 --> 01:07:43.539
and just stab them in the nose.

1262
01:07:43.574 --> 01:07:46.872
I mean. sure. there's luck
and talent and stuff.

1263
01:07:46.907 --> 01:07:49.710
but I feel like mostly
people get what they work for.

1264
01:07:49.745 --> 01:07:52.152
and I got it. Lizzie didn't.

1265
01:07:52.187 --> 01:07:55.287
But don't other things
contribute to your success?

1266
01:07:55.322 --> 01:07:56.651
Like what?

1267
01:07:56.686 --> 01:07:58.686
Like if people treat you

1268
01:07:58.721 --> 01:08:00.754
like you're gonna be successful
your whole life.

1269
01:08:00.789 --> 01:08:03.625
don't you think that makes it
easier to succeed?

1270
01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:06.463
- Like. me specifically?
- Sure.

1271
01:08:06.498 --> 01:08:09.169
Well. I was gonna succeed.
so they would've been right.

1272
01:08:09.204 --> 01:08:10.797
Uh. but what if
they treated you

1273
01:08:10.832 --> 01:08:12.370
like you weren't gonna succeed?

1274
01:08:12.405 --> 01:08:13.800
Well. why would they? I was.

1275
01:08:13.835 --> 01:08:15.736
It's a hypothetical. Jason.

1276
01:08:15.771 --> 01:08:17.804
Well. I would've been like.
"Back off. haters." Like...

1277
01:08:17.839 --> 01:08:19.839
Okay. but that's
a really confident attitude.

1278
01:08:19.874 --> 01:08:22.149
and if you were being undermined
your whole life...

1279
01:08:22.184 --> 01:08:24.844
Well. I'm confident. so I
wouldn't let them undermine me.

1280
01:08:24.879 --> 01:08:26.615
But I'm saying. like.
what if your confidence

1281
01:08:26.650 --> 01:08:28.254
isn't actually yours.

1282
01:08:28.289 --> 01:08:29.750
it's just something
that you learned how to do

1283
01:08:29.785 --> 01:08:32.687
in response to how people
have treated you?

1284
01:08:32.722 --> 01:08:34.491
Like. for me-- and I'm not

1285
01:08:34.526 --> 01:08:35.855
actually sure
how this happened--

1286
01:08:35.890 --> 01:08:37.659
but I feel like. at some point.

1287
01:08:37.694 --> 01:08:39.529
I got taught
that other people...

1288
01:08:39.564 --> 01:08:41.762
- Dude. pump the brakes. man.
- Uh. my bad. I'm not trying...

1289
01:08:41.797 --> 01:08:42.796
No. pump the brakes
on the Humvee.

1290
01:08:42.831 --> 01:08:44.369
Oh. sorry. Sorry.

1291
01:08:44.404 --> 01:08:45.865
Slow. slow. slow. slow. slow.
Nice. nice!

1292
01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:47.702
Whew. I thought we were
gonna overshoot it. Nice.

1293
01:08:47.737 --> 01:08:49.539
Whew. What were you saying?

1294
01:08:51.708 --> 01:08:54.247
Uh. um...

1295
01:08:56.251 --> 01:08:57.448
Nothing.

1296
01:08:57.483 --> 01:08:58.845
- Holy shit. you almost died.
- Yeah.

1297
01:09:22.244 --> 01:09:23.870
<i>Were you looking for anything</i>

1298
01:09:23.905 --> 01:09:25.212
specific?

1299
01:09:25.247 --> 01:09:27.511
Just... inspiration.

1300
01:09:28.778 --> 01:09:30.547
- Yeah.
- Tough client.

1301
01:09:30.582 --> 01:09:34.353
Well. anytime Oscar here senses
a really extreme reaction

1302
01:09:34.388 --> 01:09:35.882
from one of the clients.
good or bad.

1303
01:09:35.917 --> 01:09:38.984
he starts recording to a disk.

1304
01:09:39.019 --> 01:09:40.887
And the full disks
are archived here

1305
01:09:40.922 --> 01:09:43.461
so we can look back
at these moments.

1306
01:09:43.496 --> 01:09:46.695
Usually. these are
our finest work.

1307
01:09:46.730 --> 01:09:50.798
Like. the most recent one
we caught was...

1308
01:09:50.833 --> 01:09:53.966
- Huh. All right. um...

1309
01:09:54.001 --> 01:09:56.606
No one seems to have labeled
the last one.

1310
01:09:56.641 --> 01:09:58.608
KWAME
And that's why you have nothing

1311
01:09:58.643 --> 01:10:00.775
to be embarrassed about.

1312
01:10:03.813 --> 01:10:05.351
Um...

1313
01:10:07.289 --> 01:10:08.684
Um...

1314
01:10:17.662 --> 01:10:19.332
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

1315
01:10:45.657 --> 01:10:47.558
I can't wait

1316
01:10:47.593 --> 01:10:49.956
ROGER
to see this picture.

1317
01:10:49.991 --> 01:10:52.530
Nah. that. uh.
that didn't come out.

1318
01:10:52.565 --> 01:10:53.894
Let me take it again. okay?

1319
01:10:53.929 --> 01:10:56.831
You guys ready?
'Cause this is the one.

1320
01:11:14.785 --> 01:11:18.017
He was my... second client.

1321
01:11:18.987 --> 01:11:20.657
And she was...

1322
01:11:20.692 --> 01:11:22.659
Well. I mean. she was Annie.

1323
01:11:24.663 --> 01:11:27.862
First he fell for her.
then I fell for her.

1324
01:11:27.897 --> 01:11:30.403
and then I did my job.

1325
01:11:31.703 --> 01:11:33.065
You ever regret it?

1326
01:11:34.101 --> 01:11:36.376
Regret is for white people.

1327
01:11:36.411 --> 01:11:38.675
I don't think
that's how it works.

1328
01:11:38.710 --> 01:11:40.446
Well. not according
to my grandma.

1329
01:11:40.481 --> 01:11:42.415
Oh. you're gonna quote
your wise Black grandma to me?

1330
01:11:42.450 --> 01:11:44.648
- To me?

1331
01:11:44.683 --> 01:11:46.419
Yeah. but this is my real one.

1332
01:11:46.454 --> 01:11:47.915
Okay.

1333
01:11:47.950 --> 01:11:52.425
See. my daddy...
he used to shine shoes.

1334
01:11:52.460 --> 01:11:57.397
And this one day-- I must have
been five. six years old--

1335
01:11:57.432 --> 01:11:59.498
I went to town to see him.

1336
01:11:59.533 --> 01:12:03.634
And I was running toward him.
all excited.

1337
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:05.471
But before I got to him.

1338
01:12:05.506 --> 01:12:09.739
this white man looked down
from the chair above him.

1339
01:12:09.774 --> 01:12:12.412
and he just spit on his head.

1340
01:12:14.075 --> 01:12:17.076
He spit on him.

1341
01:12:17.111 --> 01:12:20.046
He said something about...

1342
01:12:20.081 --> 01:12:23.489
my daddy needed
more spit in his shine.

1343
01:12:24.954 --> 01:12:27.658
And I just froze.

1344
01:12:29.057 --> 01:12:32.058
I mean. my daddy had a temper.

1345
01:12:32.093 --> 01:12:34.731
So I'm saying to myself.

1346
01:12:34.766 --> 01:12:36.601
"Ooh!

1347
01:12:38.165 --> 01:12:41.936
He's about to whoop the shit
out of this white man."

1348
01:12:41.971 --> 01:12:43.575
Mm.

1349
01:12:46.778 --> 01:12:52.078
But instead. he wiped the spit
off of his head.

1350
01:12:52.113 --> 01:12:55.147
and he looked up at him
and he smiled.

1351
01:12:57.558 --> 01:13:02.594
And I ran home crying.
thinking about that smile.

1352
01:13:02.629 --> 01:13:06.631
When I finally ran into
my grandmother. I told her

1353
01:13:06.666 --> 01:13:10.767
how ashamed I was of my daddy.
and she got real still.

1354
01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:14.067
And you know what she said?

1355
01:13:14.102 --> 01:13:16.410
What?

1356
01:13:17.479 --> 01:13:20.975
"If your daddy come home
alive today...

1357
01:13:22.484 --> 01:13:25.045
...he ain't got nothing
to regret."

1358
01:13:26.213 --> 01:13:29.687
So have I lost some things
to this work?

1359
01:13:30.690 --> 01:13:32.789
Some pride?

1360
01:13:32.824 --> 01:13:34.626
Her?

1361
01:13:34.661 --> 01:13:35.891
Yeah.

1362
01:13:37.829 --> 01:13:40.830
But I never regretted
one smile.

1363
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:45.164
Because I'm still here.

1364
01:13:46.508 --> 01:13:48.541
And so many of us ain't.

1365
01:13:53.614 --> 01:13:56.615
But what do you do about the
little part of you that dies

1366
01:13:56.650 --> 01:13:58.815
every time you smile like that?

1367
01:13:58.850 --> 01:14:00.916
What. you'd rather go
all at once?

1368
01:14:00.951 --> 01:14:03.655
- No. I just...
- It's just pride. Aren.

1369
01:14:03.690 --> 01:14:05.723
- Feels like more.
- Well. that's 'cause you didn't

1370
01:14:05.758 --> 01:14:07.659
let her go
like I told you to do.

1371
01:14:09.597 --> 01:14:10.695
How'd you know that?

1372
01:14:11.896 --> 01:14:14.864
Of course I know
all about that.

1373
01:14:14.899 --> 01:14:16.503
I'm pretty much a wizard.

1374
01:14:17.264 --> 01:14:19.000
Fair enough.

1375
01:14:20.839 --> 01:14:23.202
You'll get another client.

1376
01:14:23.237 --> 01:14:25.171
and she will fade.

1377
01:14:25.206 --> 01:14:27.712
Then why do you keep
a picture?

1378
01:14:27.747 --> 01:14:29.780
So she doesn't.

1379
01:14:33.247 --> 01:14:35.082
That sounds awful.

1380
01:14:35.117 --> 01:14:37.249
Well. it's better than
the alternative.

1381
01:14:37.284 --> 01:14:42.287
If you do anything to interfere
with her or your client.

1382
01:14:42.322 --> 01:14:45.224
you could have
your memory erased.

1383
01:14:45.259 --> 01:14:47.732
You won't even remember
she existed.

1384
01:14:49.703 --> 01:14:53.573
I'm sorry. son.
but this is the job.

1385
01:15:25.299 --> 01:15:27.233
Hey. Lizzie?

1386
01:15:27.268 --> 01:15:28.971
- Hey.
- Hey.

1387
01:15:31.371 --> 01:15:36.209
I just wanted to apologize

1388
01:15:36.244 --> 01:15:39.212
for being weird the other day.

1389
01:15:39.247 --> 01:15:41.313
No worries.

1390
01:15:41.348 --> 01:15:43.953
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1391
01:15:45.858 --> 01:15:48.353
But. um. I really...

1392
01:15:48.388 --> 01:15:51.895
I really do want to be friends.

1393
01:15:51.930 --> 01:15:54.799
And I want to say that
out loud to you

1394
01:15:54.834 --> 01:15:59.034
because I...
I feel like we had a...

1395
01:15:59.069 --> 01:16:03.775
"We're actually gonna be
friends" night.

1396
01:16:03.810 --> 01:16:07.911
and then I was weird about it.

1397
01:16:09.310 --> 01:16:11.343
Um. yes.

1398
01:16:11.378 --> 01:16:13.246
Totally.

1399
01:16:13.281 --> 01:16:15.721
So...

1400
01:16:15.756 --> 01:16:16.920
friends?

1401
01:16:19.254 --> 01:16:20.286
Yes.

1402
01:16:20.321 --> 01:16:21.221
- Are we friends?

1403
01:16:21.256 --> 01:16:23.058
Of course we're friends.

1404
01:16:23.093 --> 01:16:24.356
- Yeah. Wait. I don't...
- Friends.

1405
01:16:24.391 --> 01:16:26.358
- It's formal. but...
-  Yeah.

1406
01:16:26.393 --> 01:16:28.096
Seal the deal. All right.

1407
01:16:28.131 --> 01:16:30.670
Um. I'm gonna get back
to work. okay?

1408
01:16:30.705 --> 01:16:32.870
- Okay. Okay.
- I'll see you around.

1409
01:16:38.713 --> 01:16:39.976
Hey. Aren.

1410
01:16:44.818 --> 01:16:45.982
- Hey. what's up?

1411
01:16:46.017 --> 01:16:48.017
I'm sorry. I just...

1412
01:16:48.052 --> 01:16:50.888
I know you just said
that we had a...

1413
01:16:50.923 --> 01:16:53.957
uh. "We're actually gonna be
friends" kind of night.

1414
01:16:53.992 --> 01:16:55.728
but that's...

1415
01:16:57.226 --> 01:16:59.061
...that's not
what I would call it.

1416
01:16:59.096 --> 01:17:02.031
What-what would you call it?

1417
01:17:05.465 --> 01:17:07.938
Um. we had a moment.

1418
01:17:09.007 --> 01:17:10.402
Didn't we?

1419
01:17:12.879 --> 01:17:15.913
And I guess I just figured that
you were. you were acting weird

1420
01:17:15.948 --> 01:17:18.784
because it was. uh.
it was too soon.

1421
01:17:18.819 --> 01:17:21.116
um... or it was too much.

1422
01:17:21.151 --> 01:17:24.152
um. or because I outrank you.

1423
01:17:24.187 --> 01:17:26.693
-  Oh. yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1424
01:17:26.728 --> 01:17:28.321
Yeah. I could order you
to do stuff.

1425
01:17:34.362 --> 01:17:35.999
So am I crazy?

1426
01:17:37.805 --> 01:17:39.167
No.

1427
01:17:41.776 --> 01:17:43.204
Thank you.

1428
01:17:46.781 --> 01:17:50.277
We had a really lovely moment.

1429
01:17:51.412 --> 01:17:53.181
But?

1430
01:17:53.216 --> 01:17:56.217
But... I...

1431
01:17:58.419 --> 01:18:02.091
...just started this job.

1432
01:18:02.126 --> 01:18:04.159
and...

1433
01:18:04.194 --> 01:18:07.063
I'm sorry...

1434
01:18:07.098 --> 01:18:09.428
Don't be sorry.

1435
01:18:09.463 --> 01:18:11.166
Um. no. I'm sorry.

1436
01:18:11.201 --> 01:18:14.070
I sh-shouldn't have brought it
up at work. That's...

1437
01:18:17.405 --> 01:18:18.470
We're friends.

1438
01:18:18.505 --> 01:18:20.439
- We're friends.
- Friends.

1439
01:18:21.948 --> 01:18:23.717
- Friends.
- Okay.

1440
01:18:25.314 --> 01:18:27.017
Okay. I'm gonna.
I'm gonna go home.

1441
01:18:27.052 --> 01:18:29.217
but I'll... I'll see you.

1442
01:18:29.252 --> 01:18:30.350
- Okay.
- See ya around.

1443
01:18:30.385 --> 01:18:32.022
All right. see ya.

1444
01:18:42.903 --> 01:18:45.200
<i>There's a tension here.</i>

1445
01:18:46.808 --> 01:18:50.403
Black... but palatable.

1446
01:18:51.439 --> 01:18:53.175
<i>Because they don't want to know</i>

1447
01:18:53.210 --> 01:18:55.947
<i>how much it costs you
to navigate them.</i>

1448
01:18:55.982 --> 01:18:59.984
<i>The sadness behind your eyes
every time you smile.</i>

1449
01:19:00.019 --> 01:19:04.857
<i>The lump in your throat
from everything you didn't say.</i>

1450
01:19:04.892 --> 01:19:08.454
<i>We're showing the client
the parts of ourselves</i>

1451
01:19:08.489 --> 01:19:10.896
<i>that make them feel good...</i>

1452
01:19:12.559 --> 01:19:14.834
<i>...and nothing more.</i>

1453
01:20:09.253 --> 01:20:12.056
Hi. uh... -JASON
Yo. presentation day.

1454
01:20:12.091 --> 01:20:13.354
Hey. let's meet 30 before.

1455
01:20:13.389 --> 01:20:16.522
Also. big news
on the Lizzie front.

1456
01:20:16.557 --> 01:20:18.128
- Yeah?
- Yeah. yeah.

1457
01:20:18.163 --> 01:20:20.592
I. uh... as soon as
the presentation's over.

1458
01:20:20.627 --> 01:20:23.331
I'm asking her out.

1459
01:20:23.366 --> 01:20:25.168
- You there?
- Mm-hmm.

1460
01:20:25.203 --> 01:20:27.071
Did you hear the part about
how after the presentation

1461
01:20:27.106 --> 01:20:28.842
I'm asking her out?

1462
01:20:38.051 --> 01:20:39.919
- I'm so sorry. I-I. um...
All good.

1463
01:20:39.954 --> 01:20:41.250
Anyway. I got a great plan
to ask her out.

1464
01:20:41.285 --> 01:20:42.889
but I'm gonna need your help.

1465
01:20:42.924 --> 01:20:44.286
What was that thing
that you said last week

1466
01:20:44.321 --> 01:20:45.617
that made her laugh?
I think it was about a...

1467
01:20:58.269 --> 01:21:00.401
Hi. This is
Lizzie. Leave a message.

1468
01:21:00.436 --> 01:21:02.205
- Hey. Lizzie. are you at work?
Hey!

1469
01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:03.536
- I need to talk to you.
- Watch where you're going!

1470
01:21:06.178 --> 01:21:07.342
JASON
You close?

1471
01:21:07.377 --> 01:21:08.673
Don't want to be
"that boatswain."

1472
01:21:08.708 --> 01:21:10.279
but. uh. you're late.

1473
01:21:12.987 --> 01:21:14.987
<i>Hey. man.</i>

1474
01:21:15.022 --> 01:21:16.054
<i>you got an ETA?</i>

1475
01:21:16.089 --> 01:21:18.089
<i>Uh. where-where you at?</i>

1476
01:21:35.537 --> 01:21:37.669
What? LaCroix?

1477
01:21:37.704 --> 01:21:40.012
No. he's not
a dockworker. Tyler.

1478
01:21:40.047 --> 01:21:42.542
Go get the one with
the fresh fruit squeezed in it.

1479
01:21:42.577 --> 01:21:44.346
- Run!

1480
01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:48.647
Mick. hi. Jason.

1481
01:21:48.682 --> 01:21:50.319
What an honor.

1482
01:21:50.354 --> 01:21:52.717
All we are really is
just bags of meat. you know?

1483
01:21:52.752 --> 01:21:54.455
In a box.

1484
01:21:57.559 --> 01:22:00.164
Okay. Linda. Linda. Linda.
Linda. Linda. Linda. Linda.

1485
01:22:00.199 --> 01:22:02.133
- Is your team all set?
- Yes. Mick. it's. uh--

1486
01:22:02.168 --> 01:22:03.398
- Of course. Of course.
- That's great.

1487
01:22:03.433 --> 01:22:06.401
You have
a very bright future here.

1488
01:22:10.242 --> 01:22:12.077
Wow. I think
I just left my body.

1489
01:22:12.112 --> 01:22:13.078
- Are we set?
- Yes.

1490
01:22:13.113 --> 01:22:14.541
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1491
01:22:27.655 --> 01:22:29.358
Ahoy.

1492
01:22:29.393 --> 01:22:31.624
Thank you all so much
for coming.

1493
01:22:31.659 --> 01:22:33.428
Or rather not coming.

1494
01:22:33.463 --> 01:22:37.201
because we are live streaming
this to your desks.

1495
01:22:37.236 --> 01:22:41.601
We read a study in
the <i>Harvard Business Review</i>

1496
01:22:41.636 --> 01:22:43.537
that said
gathering in large groups

1497
01:22:43.572 --> 01:22:45.374
leads to too much fun!

1498
01:22:45.409 --> 01:22:47.046
And unions.

1499
01:22:47.081 --> 01:22:49.675
So we're gonna have fun
from wherever we are.

1500
01:22:49.710 --> 01:22:52.777
And I would like to hear you.
one at a time.

1501
01:22:52.812 --> 01:22:55.120
First up. Los Angeles!

1502
01:22:56.585 --> 01:22:57.650
Seoul!

1503
01:23:01.689 --> 01:23:03.557
Dude. where have you been?

1504
01:23:03.592 --> 01:23:05.658
- The presentation is starting.
- I can't talk right now. man.

1505
01:23:05.693 --> 01:23:07.594
- We're about to go on.
- Have you seen Lizzie?

1506
01:23:07.629 --> 01:23:10.432
She'll be at the presentation.
Come on.

1507
01:23:11.468 --> 01:23:13.468
Uh. the other day.
I was bidding on

1508
01:23:13.503 --> 01:23:15.338
a first edition
of <i>The Fountainhead.</i>

1509
01:23:15.373 --> 01:23:17.109
and I lost.

1510
01:23:17.144 --> 01:23:21.773
Now. those of you who know me
know that I hate losing.

1511
01:23:21.808 --> 01:23:23.544
Okay?

1512
01:23:23.579 --> 01:23:25.315
But in the end.
it was kind of exhilarating.

1513
01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:30.254
cause it reminded me
of my drive to win.

1514
01:23:30.289 --> 01:23:34.225
Now. Ghana-gate...

1515
01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:36.161
reminded us that
we have to double down

1516
01:23:36.196 --> 01:23:37.591
on connecting with everybody.

1517
01:23:37.626 --> 01:23:40.660
Design will help them
find their bliss.

1518
01:23:40.695 --> 01:23:42.365
- I don't see Lizzie.
- Just find her after.

1519
01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:44.268
No. it's urgent.
I'm having a moment of clarity.

1520
01:23:44.303 --> 01:23:45.533
Hey. hey. there's nothing more
urgent than this presentation.

1521
01:23:45.568 --> 01:23:47.238
Look. I'm just
clicking the slides.

1522
01:23:47.273 --> 01:23:48.470
If I'm not back in time.
you can do it on your own.

1523
01:23:48.505 --> 01:23:50.076
- No. you have to be there.
- Why?

1524
01:23:50.111 --> 01:23:51.671
- Because you do.
- I'm just pressing a button.

1525
01:23:51.706 --> 01:23:53.640
Do I have to spell this out
for you? -Yeah. apparently.

1526
01:23:53.675 --> 01:23:56.313
So this whole rebrand
is about diversity.

1527
01:23:56.348 --> 01:23:58.480
Now. without further ado.

1528
01:23:58.515 --> 01:24:00.548
please join me
in welcoming to the stage

1529
01:24:00.583 --> 01:24:03.419
L.A. design team head
Linda Masterson!

1530
01:24:06.655 --> 01:24:08.457
Thanks so much. Mick.

1531
01:24:08.492 --> 01:24:10.690
Well. I think it's safe to say

1532
01:24:10.725 --> 01:24:14.463
that every crew is
only as good as their captain.

1533
01:24:16.302 --> 01:24:19.105
And with Mick at
the helm. it's pretty clear

1534
01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:22.372
we're not gonna be hitting
any icebergs anytime soon.

1535
01:24:52.932 --> 01:24:56.241
These may not
seem like MeetBox words.

1536
01:24:56.276 --> 01:24:58.771
They may not be carved
on the hull of values.

1537
01:24:58.806 --> 01:25:00.905
But I would argue...

1538
01:25:04.482 --> 01:25:05.415
Hey.

1539
01:25:05.450 --> 01:25:07.648
- Hey.
- I. uh...

1540
01:25:09.949 --> 01:25:12.257
I didn't like that.

1541
01:25:12.292 --> 01:25:13.753
What?

1542
01:25:13.788 --> 01:25:15.293
That thing you said.
I didn't like it.

1543
01:25:15.328 --> 01:25:16.624
Okay.

1544
01:25:16.659 --> 01:25:18.164
I felt like you were saying

1545
01:25:18.199 --> 01:25:19.330
that I'm only here
because of my race.

1546
01:25:19.365 --> 01:25:20.562
- I didn't like that.
- What?

1547
01:25:20.597 --> 01:25:22.399
And I needed to say that
out loud.

1548
01:25:22.434 --> 01:25:23.697
Whoa.

1549
01:25:23.732 --> 01:25:27.206
I feel crazy
just blurting that out.

1550
01:25:27.241 --> 01:25:28.471
That's... Wow.

1551
01:25:28.506 --> 01:25:29.868
- Whoa.

1552
01:25:29.903 --> 01:25:31.441
Just once. I wanted to say
what I thought.

1553
01:25:31.476 --> 01:25:33.839
- no matter the consequences.
- I'm not racist.

1554
01:25:33.874 --> 01:25:35.247
What?

1555
01:25:35.282 --> 01:25:36.875
- I'm not racist.
- Oh. no. no. no. no.

1556
01:25:36.910 --> 01:25:38.382
That's not what I'm saying.

1557
01:25:38.417 --> 01:25:39.614
I was just trying
to tell you how I felt.

1558
01:25:39.649 --> 01:25:41.352
which is actually
pretty big for me.

1559
01:25:41.387 --> 01:25:43.585
cause I usually only
worry about how you feel...

1560
01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:45.752
'Cause I would never say
anything racist.

1561
01:25:45.787 --> 01:25:47.325
No. I'm just talking about me.

1562
01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:49.261
I don't have a racist bone
in my body.

1563
01:25:49.296 --> 01:25:52.957
Sorry. I'm actually having a
moment of real personal growth.

1564
01:25:52.992 --> 01:25:55.663
and so-- no offense--

1565
01:25:55.698 --> 01:25:59.502
I don't really care if you're
racist on a skeletal level.

1566
01:25:59.537 --> 01:26:01.240
Whoa. we can't just.
like. throw that shit around.

1567
01:26:01.275 --> 01:26:02.736
All right?
It's like a death sentence.

1568
01:26:02.771 --> 01:26:04.936
No. getting shot
is a death sentence.

1569
01:26:04.971 --> 01:26:06.410
You know what I mean.
- No. I don't totally.

1570
01:26:06.445 --> 01:26:07.708
You did say a thing.

1571
01:26:07.743 --> 01:26:09.974
You said
you only needed me onstage

1572
01:26:10.009 --> 01:26:11.481
- because I'm diverse.
- No.

1573
01:26:11.516 --> 01:26:13.483
- No. I didn't.
- Yes. you did.

1574
01:26:13.518 --> 01:26:14.715
No. no. I said

1575
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:16.618
the presentation
is about diversity.

1576
01:26:17.654 --> 01:26:19.786
That... that's semantics.

1577
01:26:19.821 --> 01:26:21.953
That's-that's not
what happened. -I'm sorry...

1578
01:26:21.988 --> 01:26:24.659
- I'm sorry you heard it wrong.
- I-I was just there. That's...

1579
01:26:24.694 --> 01:26:26.331
If what you're saying happened.

1580
01:26:26.366 --> 01:26:27.827
then I'm racist.
and I'm not racist.

1581
01:26:27.862 --> 01:26:29.697
so it couldn't have happened
how you said it happened.

1582
01:26:29.732 --> 01:26:31.303
So because
you don't want to feel bad.

1583
01:26:31.338 --> 01:26:32.304
the thing that just happened
didn't happen?

1584
01:26:32.339 --> 01:26:33.635
That makes it sound crazy.

1585
01:26:33.670 --> 01:26:35.274
- That's because it's crazy.
- Can we...

1586
01:26:35.309 --> 01:26:37.375
Can we just please
focus up here?

1587
01:26:38.345 --> 01:26:40.873
And now Jason Mundt.

1588
01:26:42.008 --> 01:26:43.513
- I don't care if you're racist.
- Dude.

1589
01:26:43.548 --> 01:26:45.383
- Everyone's racist.
- Aren.

1590
01:26:45.418 --> 01:26:46.912
I care that you won't
acknowledge what just happened.

1591
01:26:46.947 --> 01:26:48.419
I'm sorry you're offended. okay?

1592
01:26:48.454 --> 01:26:49.882
I mean. how can we move forward

1593
01:26:49.917 --> 01:26:50.883
- until we acknowledge...
- I apologize. You hear me?

1594
01:26:50.918 --> 01:26:52.291
This is me apologizing.

1595
01:26:52.326 --> 01:26:53.556
...the basic facts
of the situation?

1596
01:26:53.591 --> 01:26:54.557
- Are they lovers?

1597
01:26:54.592 --> 01:26:56.592
I don't think so.

1598
01:26:56.627 --> 01:26:58.363
I'm not asking for
reparations. -I did all of it.

1599
01:26:58.398 --> 01:26:59.727
I'm not asking for you
to apologize. -I did racism.

1600
01:26:59.762 --> 01:27:01.267
- I did slavery.
- I'm just asking for...

1601
01:27:01.302 --> 01:27:02.499
If I could just do
this presentation.

1602
01:27:02.534 --> 01:27:03.797
- that would be great.
- I'm sorry.

1603
01:27:03.832 --> 01:27:04.732
- did you say you did slavery?
- Uh...

1604
01:27:04.767 --> 01:27:06.602
Like. as an institution?

1605
01:27:06.637 --> 01:27:08.472
How did we get there?!
- I'm just. I'm just gonna...

1606
01:27:08.507 --> 01:27:10.474
All you had to do was listen
to me and the thing that I was

1607
01:27:10.509 --> 01:27:11.970
- saying about myself!

1608
01:27:12.005 --> 01:27:13.378
- Hey. what's happening?
- For Christ's sake...

1609
01:27:13.413 --> 01:27:14.841
I don't know.
He's freaking out.

1610
01:27:14.876 --> 01:27:16.414
...there's a section
of the presentation called

1611
01:27:16.449 --> 01:27:17.910
"Diverse Experiences."
It's a dumb title.

1612
01:27:17.945 --> 01:27:19.714
- but it's in there.
- Okay. Mick. I've got this.

1613
01:27:19.749 --> 01:27:21.452
You couldn't be less
interested... -Um. excuse me.

1614
01:27:21.487 --> 01:27:23.014
Oh. you want to get in
on this. Mick? -Uh. fellas?

1615
01:27:23.049 --> 01:27:24.455
Yeah. I think I might be able
to help out with this.

1616
01:27:24.490 --> 01:27:25.687
- Just go.
- All right. Ahoy. MeetBox.

1617
01:27:25.722 --> 01:27:26.655
Oh. you think
you understand me?

1618
01:27:26.690 --> 01:27:28.525
- Uh. yeah.
- Mick.

1619
01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:29.757
you don't understand other
people. -And my name is Jason.

1620
01:27:29.792 --> 01:27:31.022
- You own an island.

1621
01:27:31.057 --> 01:27:32.892
Right. -JASON: I'd like
to get started...

1622
01:27:32.927 --> 01:27:34.432
No one with an island has
empathy. -MASTERSON: Just stop.

1623
01:27:34.467 --> 01:27:36.599
It's not possible
to possess both things.

1624
01:27:36.634 --> 01:27:38.370
- Right.
Dude. stop.

1625
01:27:38.405 --> 01:27:39.701
Okay. I'm so sorry.

1626
01:27:39.736 --> 01:27:40.801
Why are you doing this?
We're friends.

1627
01:27:40.836 --> 01:27:42.407
You're not my friend.

1628
01:27:42.442 --> 01:27:43.738
And you don't want
to be friends.

1629
01:27:43.773 --> 01:27:45.443
because if we were
actual friends.

1630
01:27:45.478 --> 01:27:48.545
you would have to talk to me
and listen to me

1631
01:27:48.580 --> 01:27:52.879
and make space for the reality
that I live in a country

1632
01:27:52.914 --> 01:27:56.718
that makes me feel
like it wants me dead.

1633
01:27:56.753 --> 01:27:57.785
- What?
- What?

1634
01:27:57.820 --> 01:28:00.018
Where if I get shot today.

1635
01:28:00.053 --> 01:28:03.054
there is an army of people
ready to explain how it was

1636
01:28:03.089 --> 01:28:05.056
- probably my fault.
-  Probably?

1637
01:28:05.091 --> 01:28:07.366
- And I feel that every day.
- Aren. the diversity section

1638
01:28:07.401 --> 01:28:09.665
of this whole thing is coming
later. -In every glance.

1639
01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:11.931
in every movie that's
supposed to be uplifting.

1640
01:28:11.966 --> 01:28:13.768
- And maybe less about death.
- And that changes everything.

1641
01:28:13.803 --> 01:28:15.506
Because death and diversity
don't really have anything

1642
01:28:15.541 --> 01:28:16.771
- to do with each other. so...
- That changes how I walk

1643
01:28:16.806 --> 01:28:19.741
and how I talk
and how I take up space!

1644
01:28:19.776 --> 01:28:20.775
Or don't!

1645
01:28:20.810 --> 01:28:22.040
I got this. Okay.

1646
01:28:22.075 --> 01:28:23.646
It changes
what risks feel reasonable

1647
01:28:23.681 --> 01:28:26.451
and which ones are insane.

1648
01:28:26.486 --> 01:28:29.014
And it's taken me my whole life
to realize that this is

1649
01:28:29.049 --> 01:28:30.851
a weight
that I walk around with

1650
01:28:30.886 --> 01:28:32.457
- all the time.
Hi.

1651
01:28:32.492 --> 01:28:33.788
- My name is Jason. and I...
- And after this

1652
01:28:33.823 --> 01:28:35.427
lifelong journey
of figuring out

1653
01:28:35.462 --> 01:28:37.396
that maybe this shit
impacts everything I do...

1654
01:28:37.431 --> 01:28:38.925
Linda. you-you're not Jason.
You can't do that.

1655
01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:40.432
...you want to turn around
and act like I'm crazy

1656
01:28:40.467 --> 01:28:41.928
for acknowledging it.
No. no. no. no.

1657
01:28:41.963 --> 01:28:43.600
No. no. no. no. You don't
get to put me in danger

1658
01:28:43.635 --> 01:28:44.898
just because you don't want
to feel like an asshole.

1659
01:28:44.933 --> 01:28:46.372
Young man. young man.

1660
01:28:46.407 --> 01:28:47.439
- Be the asshole.
We have forums...

1661
01:28:47.474 --> 01:28:48.770
Mick. hold on a second.

1662
01:28:48.805 --> 01:28:50.002
- Jason!
- I beg your pardon?

1663
01:28:50.037 --> 01:28:51.971
Because the shame
that you feel like

1664
01:28:52.006 --> 01:28:53.973
you did something wrong
just by being yourself.

1665
01:28:54.008 --> 01:28:55.843
- that is my whole life.
You know what?

1666
01:28:55.878 --> 01:28:58.549
- You know what. everybody?
And this place...

1667
01:28:58.584 --> 01:28:59.979
- this country...
- This is MeetBox.

1668
01:29:00.014 --> 01:29:02.014
...has been
so deeply indifferent

1669
01:29:02.049 --> 01:29:04.456
- to whether or not I exist...

1670
01:29:04.491 --> 01:29:08.460
...that on some level. I don't
think I have the right to.

1671
01:29:08.495 --> 01:29:10.429
And what I am saying to you

1672
01:29:10.464 --> 01:29:11.991
that you so steadfastly
refuse to hear...

1673
01:29:12.026 --> 01:29:13.564
It's the Mick way.
It's the MeetBox way.

1674
01:29:13.599 --> 01:29:15.401
...is fuck that!

1675
01:29:15.436 --> 01:29:17.733
I do!

1676
01:29:18.934 --> 01:29:20.901
I deserve to be here.

1677
01:29:22.069 --> 01:29:25.411
Not just on this stage
but in this world.

1678
01:29:28.746 --> 01:29:32.110
And that. believe it or not.
is a revelation to me.

1679
01:29:34.213 --> 01:29:38.820
So you want to know about
my-my "diverse experience"?

1680
01:29:40.494 --> 01:29:43.429
I have been on this planet
for 27 years.

1681
01:29:43.464 --> 01:29:47.433
and I just figured out this week
that I deserve to be alive.

1682
01:30:08.214 --> 01:30:09.983
I didn't know that.

1683
01:30:12.185 --> 01:30:13.855
Me neither.

1684
01:30:18.763 --> 01:30:20.598
- Hi.
- Hi. That was...

1685
01:30:21.733 --> 01:30:23.095
I'm gonna move us a little.

1686
01:30:23.130 --> 01:30:24.668
What?

1687
01:30:26.166 --> 01:30:27.770
So. I'm gonna go soon.

1688
01:30:27.805 --> 01:30:29.772
- and I-I can't explain.
- Oh. my God.

1689
01:30:29.807 --> 01:30:31.741
But even though we might
never see each other again.

1690
01:30:31.776 --> 01:30:33.479
I need you to know
that you're not crazy.

1691
01:30:33.514 --> 01:30:35.140
What we had was real.

1692
01:30:35.175 --> 01:30:37.978
And as long as I've known you.
I've wanted to do this.

1693
01:30:43.150 --> 01:30:45.150
Aren?

1694
01:30:51.092 --> 01:30:53.532
Aren Mbondo.

1695
01:30:57.703 --> 01:31:00.099
We have seen your crimes
on the MeetBox stage.

1696
01:31:00.134 --> 01:31:02.904
crimes that have
endangered everyone

1697
01:31:02.939 --> 01:31:07.172
and kept me
at this miserable height.

1698
01:31:07.207 --> 01:31:09.548
What happened after
you left the auditorium?

1699
01:31:09.583 --> 01:31:12.716
I teleported my client's love
interest to a romantic location

1700
01:31:12.751 --> 01:31:13.948
where I tried to kiss her.

1701
01:31:15.688 --> 01:31:19.019
In my defense.
I had feelings for her first.

1702
01:31:19.054 --> 01:31:22.220
and he kind of
colonized my crush.

1703
01:31:24.191 --> 01:31:27.797
How can you possibly justify
your behavior?

1704
01:31:29.328 --> 01:31:33.605
I guess I've always felt like
it's my job

1705
01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:35.607
to make white people
feel comfortable.

1706
01:31:35.642 --> 01:31:38.544
and obviously.
here it literally is.

1707
01:31:38.579 --> 01:31:41.239
but...

1708
01:31:41.274 --> 01:31:43.175
it shouldn't be.

1709
01:31:46.213 --> 01:31:48.686
I get it though...

1710
01:31:50.756 --> 01:31:52.690
Aren.

1711
01:31:52.725 --> 01:31:54.758
you are hereby banished

1712
01:31:54.793 --> 01:31:58.025
from the American Society
of Magical Negroes.

1713
01:32:00.029 --> 01:32:01.831
Makes sense.

1714
01:32:16.980 --> 01:32:18.914
You got a history
of concussions?

1715
01:32:20.016 --> 01:32:23.149
Because technically
this spell is brain damage.

1716
01:32:24.251 --> 01:32:26.053
I'm okay.

1717
01:32:49.309 --> 01:32:51.309
- Are you gonna...
- Just give me a second.

1718
01:32:51.344 --> 01:32:53.113
Um. yeah. okay.

1719
01:32:53.148 --> 01:32:55.016
You know you're not
gonna be able

1720
01:32:55.051 --> 01:32:56.688
to take care of yourself
out there?

1721
01:32:59.858 --> 01:33:02.760
Um... I'll be fine.

1722
01:33:08.735 --> 01:33:09.965
Okay.

1723
01:33:31.351 --> 01:33:33.054
Shit.

1724
01:33:33.089 --> 01:33:34.792
What? What's...

1725
01:33:34.827 --> 01:33:38.026
I think you must have
gave somebody notions.

1726
01:33:38.061 --> 01:33:40.226
I could really use a hand here.

1727
01:33:40.261 --> 01:33:44.065
I don't think you really
understand the welfare state.

1728
01:33:44.100 --> 01:33:45.330
What?

1729
01:33:45.365 --> 01:33:47.200
But it's got to be
a two-way street.

1730
01:33:47.235 --> 01:33:49.939
I can't be the only one
grabbing crotches around here.

1731
01:33:49.974 --> 01:33:52.337
You've got to check in
on my penis as well.

1732
01:33:55.716 --> 01:33:58.211
But this shutdown
feels different. Big.

1733
01:33:58.246 --> 01:34:00.752
Did I just put you
out of a job? -Oh. no.

1734
01:34:00.787 --> 01:34:03.150
Being a magical Negro
isn't just about magic.

1735
01:34:03.185 --> 01:34:05.922
As long as there are
fretful whites.

1736
01:34:05.957 --> 01:34:07.990
we will be here.

1737
01:34:11.193 --> 01:34:13.028
All right.

1738
01:34:13.063 --> 01:34:15.360
Uh... I'm gonna go.

1739
01:34:15.395 --> 01:34:17.835
But what you gonna do for work?

1740
01:34:17.870 --> 01:34:19.837
Uh...

1741
01:34:19.872 --> 01:34:21.839
Actually. I have an idea
for a new piece.

1742
01:34:21.874 --> 01:34:23.742
The yarn?

1743
01:34:23.777 --> 01:34:25.744
You do remember
nobody liked it?

1744
01:34:25.779 --> 01:34:27.845
Yeah. but I do.

1745
01:34:29.442 --> 01:34:33.917
Well. if I'm letting you out of
here with your memory intact.

1746
01:34:33.952 --> 01:34:35.820
you better text me tonight.

1747
01:34:35.855 --> 01:34:37.855
Okay. sure.

1748
01:34:37.890 --> 01:34:41.188
And none of that emoji shit.
I need words.

1749
01:34:42.829 --> 01:34:45.258
I'm curious to see how you
gonna make it out of all this.

1750
01:34:45.293 --> 01:34:46.798
Make it out of what?

1751
01:34:48.230 --> 01:34:50.329
You didn't leave her in L.A.

1752
01:34:50.364 --> 01:34:52.804
Oh.

1753
01:34:52.839 --> 01:34:54.773
No.

1754
01:34:54.808 --> 01:34:55.807
No. no. no.

1755
01:34:55.842 --> 01:34:57.743
No. no. no. no. no. no. no!

1756
01:34:57.778 --> 01:34:59.371
LIZZIE
<i>Aren. what is going on?</i>

1757
01:34:59.406 --> 01:35:01.373
<i>You just left me here
and you just disappeared?</i>

1758
01:35:01.408 --> 01:35:03.078
<i>- I'm on the...</i>
Excuse me!

1759
01:35:03.113 --> 01:35:04.475
LIZZIE
<i>...on the Empire State Building.</i>

1760
01:35:04.510 --> 01:35:06.752
<i>What is going on?</i>

1761
01:35:06.787 --> 01:35:08.248
<i>Um. okay. great.</i>

1762
01:35:08.283 --> 01:35:10.987
<i>So. I'm. like.
on the Brooklyn Bridge now</i>

1763
01:35:11.022 --> 01:35:12.219
<i>on the way to the airport.</i>

1764
01:35:12.254 --> 01:35:15.354
<i>uh. and I guess
I'm in New York.</i>

1765
01:35:15.389 --> 01:35:18.027
<i>I. uh. landed in L.A.</i>

1766
01:35:18.062 --> 01:35:21.261
<i>Um. I'm in a car home
right now.</i>

1767
01:35:21.296 --> 01:35:23.065
<i>Um. can you just--
can you give me a call</i>

1768
01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:25.166
<i>and let me know
that you're okay?</i>

1769
01:35:29.469 --> 01:35:31.403
Lizzie.

1770
01:35:31.438 --> 01:35:33.273
Hey. I'm so sorry.

1771
01:35:33.308 --> 01:35:35.539
I didn't realize
that when I left...

1772
01:35:59.598 --> 01:36:02.170
I. uh...

1773
01:36:02.205 --> 01:36:03.567
Uh-huh?

1774
01:36:03.602 --> 01:36:05.206
Ah.

1775
01:36:05.241 --> 01:36:09.111
Hi. uh. Aren.

1776
01:36:09.146 --> 01:36:13.214
Um. I feel terrible
about leaving you in New York.

1777
01:36:13.249 --> 01:36:14.919
That was not
what I was planning on.

1778
01:36:14.954 --> 01:36:18.318
Mm-hmm.
So. do you have powers or...

1779
01:36:18.353 --> 01:36:21.321
No. right. Okay. that's
a. that's a fair question.

1780
01:36:21.356 --> 01:36:25.292
I'm part of this magic society--

1781
01:36:25.327 --> 01:36:26.557
Or-or I was.

1782
01:36:26.592 --> 01:36:28.526
I just quit. so...

1783
01:36:28.561 --> 01:36:30.198
Good on me or...

1784
01:36:30.233 --> 01:36:32.299
You're kidding.

1785
01:36:32.334 --> 01:36:34.169
Nope.

1786
01:36:34.204 --> 01:36:36.138
Which is such a crazy
coincidence. because I'm...

1787
01:36:36.173 --> 01:36:37.942
I'm also a part
of a magic society.

1788
01:36:37.977 --> 01:36:40.373
and I was about to quit.

1789
01:36:40.408 --> 01:36:41.913
Yeah. okay. that's funny.

1790
01:36:41.948 --> 01:36:43.915
- I-I deserve that.
No. really.

1791
01:36:43.950 --> 01:36:45.345
But first I thought
I would kidnap you

1792
01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:47.314
and leave you
on the Space Needle.

1793
01:36:47.349 --> 01:36:51.219
No. I was...
I was trying to be romantic.

1794
01:36:51.254 --> 01:36:53.122
All right.

1795
01:36:53.157 --> 01:36:55.025
Just walk with me. then.

1796
01:36:55.060 --> 01:36:56.620
- That sounds much nicer.
Okay.

1797
01:36:56.655 --> 01:36:59.524
Maybe no more magic.

1798
01:36:59.559 --> 01:37:03.264
Yeah. No more magic.

1799
01:37:03.299 --> 01:37:05.904
Oh. and you still
owe me a coffee.

1800
01:37:22.186 --> 01:37:23.449
Can I help you?

1801
01:37:27.191 --> 01:37:29.191
Oh. Okay.
