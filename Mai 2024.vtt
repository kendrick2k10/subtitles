just a few apartments in this building.

64
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.916
The neighbors here are super nice.

65
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.666
If you don't like this one. let me know.
I'll switch you to a different unit.

66
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.750
I don't think you'll need
to switch though.

67
00:04:52.833 --> 00:04:54.666
This is the newest one.

68
00:04:55.333 --> 00:04:56.708
Oh my!

69
00:04:56.791 --> 00:04:58.875
What a terrible job they did!

70
00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.083
-Just leave it. it's okay.
-I'm so pissed!

71
00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:04.125
Just leave it. I'll have
my guys come fix it for you.

72
00:05:04.208 --> 00:05:06.416
Open the boxes. I'll help you unpack.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.916
-Okay.
-Come on. open them up.

74

Here. give that to me.

75
00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:11.875
Give it to me. I'll put it up here.

76
00:05:12.458 --> 00:05:16.458
‎Damn. it was done
‎by the same guys. It's them.

77
00:05:16.541 --> 00:05:19.166
Don't worry. I'll have them
come fix it tomorrow.

78
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.666
-Unpack by yourself. It will be better!
-Okay.

79
00:05:22.458 --> 00:05:24.166
Welcome to the building.

80
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.416
Two months' rent. please.

81
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.541

-Thank you.
-Thank you.

83
00:05:35.666 --> 00:05:36.875
Any tip?

84
00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.541
-Here. have a drink on me.
-Thank you.

85
00:05:44.583 --> 00:05:46.208
Single or married. Mai?

86
00:05:47.208 --> 00:05:48.583
I said are you married?

87
00:05:48.666 --> 00:05:51.333
-I need to unpack.
-Just unpack. I'm just asking.

88
00:05:51.416 --> 00:05:53.125
I can't. actually.

89
00:05:53.208 --> 00:05:55.500
Oh. okay. I'll head out then.

90
00:05:57.125 --> 00:05:59.958
Oh. how much do you make a month?

91
00:06:02.541 --> 00:06:04.750
Okay. okay. Have a good evening!

92
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:06.958
Good night.

93
00:06:09.166 --> 00:06:10.291
She's a sugar baby for sure.

94
00:06:10.375 --> 00:06:11.583
How do you know?

95
00:06:11.666 --> 00:06:13.583
Cash! It's all cash!

96
00:06:13.666 --> 00:06:14.791
I don't think so.

97
00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:17.166
-She's a whore for sure.
-Really?

98
00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.291
Just look at her sleek eyebrows.

99
00:06:19.375 --> 00:06:20.875
That's my experience.

100
00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.458
Hey. sis. your eyebrows are the same!

101
00:06:22.541 --> 00:06:24.291
You know what you're saying. bitch?

102
00:06:24.375 --> 00:06:26.125
Such nosy neighbors!

103
00:06:26.208 --> 00:06:27.833
Actually. who is her sugar daddy?

104
00:06:27.916 --> 00:06:29.666
-Watch your child!
-Hurry up. kid.

105
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.916
Tell me. I'm sure you know.
You've been talking to her for so long.

106
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.375
-How would I know?
-Come on. you should've asked.

107
00:06:34.458 --> 00:06:36.291
-She's a new one.
-Of course. another of Duong's girls.

108
00:06:36.375 --> 00:06:38.708
How come he has so many girls?

109
00:06:38.791 --> 00:06:39.833
‎He's too much.

110
00:06:39.916 --> 00:06:42.291
-He picks different girl each day.
-It's normal for him. He's handsome!

111
00:07:46.375 --> 00:07:48.625

117
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:02.916
A little loud though.

118
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.916
It'll take a while to know.

119
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.875

It's pretty nice here.

126
00:08:20.541 --> 00:08:22.375
Show me around.

127
00:08:22.458 --> 00:08:24.250
Okay. I'll reverse the camera.

128
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:31.291
I'll call you later.

129
00:08:32.291 --> 00:08:33.875
What's your name?

130
00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.000
You haven't told me yet.

131
00:08:36.083 --> 00:08:37.541
Good night.

132
00:08:45.333 --> 00:08:46.416
Hey!

133
00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:03.541
Oh my gosh!

134
00:09:03.625 --> 00:09:08.583
You've only been here for two weeks.
but look at this… Mai. Mai. Mai.

135
00:09:08.666 --> 00:09:10.000
Beginner's luck!

136
00:09:10.083 --> 00:09:13.916
Can you pretend to be a little worse.
so the rest of us can make a living?

137
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.083
You girl.

138
00:09:15.166 --> 00:09:16.166
Where's Mai?

139
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:17.833
My friend is getting cooked in the sauna.

140
00:09:17.916 --> 00:09:19.583
Oh. we can start on him now.

141
00:09:19.666 --> 00:09:22.875
This is his first time here.
Don't embarrass me.

142
00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:26.250
Don't worry. Trust me. I'm Tu.

143
00:09:26.333 --> 00:09:29.291
It's wet over here. Wipe it down. please.

144
00:09:29.375 --> 00:09:31.125
-Mr. Binh!
-Is Mai available?

145
00:09:31.208 --> 00:09:33.333
She just got booked.

146
00:09:33.416 --> 00:09:36.000
Head to the sauna.
I'll get someone else for you.

147
00:09:36.083 --> 00:09:37.958
You can count on Tu.

148
00:09:38.708 --> 00:09:42.375
Mr. Diep. Mr. Vinh. hello!

149
00:09:42.458 --> 00:09:45.416
Stop looking at your phone.
Take care of them or I'll kill you.

150
00:09:46.208 --> 00:09:49.333
It's good to have so many bookings
as a newcomer.

151
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:51.958
You are…

152
00:09:53.541 --> 00:09:56.458
This is Trinh. the Golden Hand here.

153
00:09:56.541 --> 00:09:57.416
Hello.

154
00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.333
This is Mai. We're from the same hometown.

155
00:09:59.416 --> 00:10:01.125
She's so good.

156
00:10:01.208 --> 00:10:03.125
the Golden Hand at the other branch.

157
00:10:03.208 --> 00:10:07.291
That's why the boss moved her here
to attract more customers.

158
00:10:08.208 --> 00:10:10.583
Work hard so you can be
the Golden Hand here as well.

159
00:10:10.666 --> 00:10:12.166
That'd be so good.

160
00:10:16.208 --> 00:10:19.291
I was out for two weeks because of Covid.
so we're only meeting now.

161
00:10:19.375 --> 00:10:23.583
I see. I'm new. Please support me.
I gotta go now.

162
00:10:23.666 --> 00:10:25.375
-Mai!
-Yes?

163
00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:28.291
Let's trade techniques someday.

164
00:10:28.375 --> 00:10:30.375
Show me your amazing skills.

165
00:10:30.458 --> 00:10:33.875
You're more experienced for sure.
I'll see you around.

166
00:10:39.416 --> 00:10:40.500
Trinh.

167
00:10:41.583 --> 00:10:43.333
Have you recovered?

168
00:10:43.416 --> 00:10:45.333
Learn to think before you speak.

169
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:48.750
Oh. I gotta go.

170
00:11:44.875 --> 00:11:46.791
-Why did you hit me?
-I didn't mean to.

171
00:11:46.875 --> 00:11:49.666
-The oil…
-It hurts.

172
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:52.000
Sorry. relax. relax.

173
00:11:52.083 --> 00:11:54.000
I'll continue.

174
00:12:00.833 --> 00:12:01.916
Sorry. baby.

175
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.416
My stomach is a little upset.

176
00:12:04.333 --> 00:12:05.625
Sorry. I didn't mean to.

177
00:12:07.166 --> 00:12:09.458
I'll tip you more.

178
00:12:14.375 --> 00:12:18.333
I think you should go to the restroom.
I can wait.

179
00:12:18.416 --> 00:12:20.125
Give me five minutes then.

180
00:12:20.208 --> 00:12:21.041
Sure.

181
00:12:21.125 --> 00:12:22.416
What's wrong with me?

182
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:32.500
Turn over. please.

183
00:12:43.291 --> 00:12:44.875
Oh. so you work here.

184
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.750
Why did you avoid me

185
00:12:47.833 --> 00:12:50.041
just to meet me here?

186
00:12:51.416 --> 00:12:53.500
Welcome then. neighbor.

187
00:12:53.583 --> 00:12:55.166
Lay down. please. so I can continue.

188
00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:56.375
Give me your name then.

189
00:12:57.041 --> 00:13:00.041
You'll see my name on the tip paper.

190
00:13:01.791 --> 00:13:03.458
What do you think you're doing?

191
00:13:04.416 --> 00:13:06.416
I'm just pointing at your name tag.

192
00:13:10.041 --> 00:13:11.708
but my name's Duong.

193
00:13:12.708 --> 00:13:14.875
Lay down. Duong. The time's almost up.

194
00:13:17.333 --> 00:13:19.041
What do you mean?

195
00:13:19.125 --> 00:13:20.958
Leaving space for you.

196
00:13:21.875 --> 00:13:23.666
Do you talk to all girls like that?

197
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:25.958
Not really. Only to pretty girls.

198
00:13:26.041 --> 00:13:28.041
I'll consider that a compliment.

199
00:13:29.541 --> 00:13:32.125
Just tell me where you feel pain
and I'll work on that.

200
00:13:32.208 --> 00:13:33.833
It kinda hurts here.

201
00:13:33.916 --> 00:13:35.416
A chest massage then?

202
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.041
Who'd call it that?

203
00:13:37.125 --> 00:13:39.375
It's a heart massage.

204
00:13:39.458 --> 00:13:41.166
My heart is broken. ah!

205
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:42.916
So cheeky.

206
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.208
Relax. Bobby. relax.

207
00:13:48.375 --> 00:13:49.958
Are you massaging or fighting me?

208
00:13:50.458 --> 00:13:51.750
Get me someone else.

209
00:13:51.833 --> 00:13:54.000
I'll do something else.

210
00:13:54.083 --> 00:13:55.458
-Something else.
-I've experienced enough.

211
00:13:55.541 --> 00:13:56.583
Get someone else.

212
00:13:57.666 --> 00:13:59.416
How can a massage feel like a fight?

213
00:14:00.791 --> 00:14:02.666
I'll work on your hand.

214
00:14:11.458 --> 00:14:12.625
What?

215
00:14:15.708 --> 00:14:16.833
You're beautiful.

216
00:14:16.916 --> 00:14:18.083
I know.

217
00:14:19.125 --> 00:14:21.541
This hand needs some special treatment.

218
00:14:21.625 --> 00:14:23.875
Ouch. ouch. that hurts.

219
00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.916
It's okay. it'll feel good later.

220
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.250
Can we get to the good bit
and skip this pain bit?

221
00:14:31.416 --> 00:14:33.083
My upper body is a little sensitive.

222
00:14:33.166 --> 00:14:34.416
Can you move lower?

223
00:14:53.333 --> 00:14:55.250
Oh. oh. I'm there. I'm there.

224
00:15:02.291 --> 00:15:03.500
What now?

225
00:15:03.583 --> 00:15:05.750
My feet got injured
from carrying the suitcases.

226
00:15:05.833 --> 00:15:08.291
-Why didn't you tell me?
-I can only tell when you press on them.

227
00:15:08.375 --> 00:15:09.875
I'll wrap up then.

228
00:15:10.916 --> 00:15:12.500
I didn't mean for you to go that low.

229
00:15:12.583 --> 00:15:14.541
Go a little higher.

230
00:15:15.333 --> 00:15:16.958
You know what I mean?

231
00:15:18.125 --> 00:15:19.000
Got it.

232
00:15:31.041 --> 00:15:32.125
What are you doing?

233
00:15:32.208 --> 00:15:33.458
You told me to move higher.

234
00:15:33.541 --> 00:15:35.083
Is this high enough?

235
00:15:35.166 --> 00:15:36.833
Are you trying to play dumb?

236
00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.083
Hey there.

237
00:15:40.166 --> 00:15:41.583
we give therapeutic massages here.

238
00:15:41.666 --> 00:15:44.083
If you're expecting something else.
go somewhere else.

239
00:15:44.166 --> 00:15:45.958
Show some respect.

240
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.291
I'm sorry.

241
00:15:51.291 --> 00:15:53.208
-Let's call it for today.
-Okay.

242
00:15:55.125 --> 00:15:57.541
-Thank you.
-I'm really sorry.

243
00:15:57.625 --> 00:15:59.375
You seem nice.

244
00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:01.666
so I took it a little too far.

245
00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:02.916
Please forgive me.

246
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.083
-It's okay.
-Hey.

247
00:16:05.666 --> 00:16:07.875
We're neighbors after all.

248
00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.000
and somehow. I get injured
every time I see you.

249
00:16:10.083 --> 00:16:11.375
Are you going to make it up to me?

250
00:16:12.333 --> 00:16:13.541
Sure.

251
00:16:14.041 --> 00:16:18.125
SERVICE EVALUATION FORM
TIP: 0

252
00:16:18.791 --> 00:16:19.666
No tip this time.

253
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:24.625
But if you like my service. please give me
a five-star rating. Thank you very much.

254
00:16:24.708 --> 00:16:26.250
Hope to see you again.

255
00:16:39.458 --> 00:16:40.750
Satisfied?

256
00:16:41.791 --> 00:16:44.208
How was your first time here?

257
00:16:44.291 --> 00:16:45.333
Mai's not bad. huh?

258
00:16:45.416 --> 00:16:47.250
-What are you doing?
-Cooling you down.

259
00:16:47.333 --> 00:16:48.958
Actually. you're heating me up.

260
00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:51.708
Please don't. Let's cool down
with some hot ginger tea.

261
00:16:55.625 --> 00:16:57.041
Not bad.

262
00:16:57.791 --> 00:16:59.625
She's untouchable.

263
00:17:00.875 --> 00:17:02.791
No one can hit on her.

264
00:17:02.875 --> 00:17:05.125
She's just a massage girl.

265
00:17:05.708 --> 00:17:08.666
Well. you can try. but she'll
hit you back. I learned that the hard way.

266
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:10.125
That's you.

267
00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:14.083
Duong.

268
00:17:14.166 --> 00:17:16.458
I know you're a lady killer.

269
00:17:16.541 --> 00:17:18.291
but if you can get with her.
I'll call you daddy.

270
00:17:19.166 --> 00:17:20.916
Hello. dear son.

271
00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:25.208
I know you love coff--

272
00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:28.375
Mai. it's me.

273
00:17:29.041 --> 00:17:30.125
It's me.

274
00:17:32.083 --> 00:17:32.958
It's me again.

275
00:17:34.833 --> 00:17:37.541
Hey. miss neighbor. going for breakfast?

276
00:17:38.375 --> 00:17:39.833
I got this for you.

277
00:17:39.916 --> 00:17:42.291
-Breakfast?
-Thanks. I'm meeting someone.

278
00:17:46.916 --> 00:17:49.250
Don't worry.
It's my place. I'll take care of you.

279
00:17:51.166 --> 00:17:53.416
Ms. Lucy! Why didn't you call me first?

280
00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:54.875
Get her a table. idiots!

281
00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:56.083
‎Oh my God!

282
00:17:59.666 --> 00:18:01.708
Stop with the moaning
or they'll think I'm doing things to you.

283
00:18:02.833 --> 00:18:06.000
-I hate your moaning.
-I just can't help it!

284
00:18:06.083 --> 00:18:07.250
Up to you.

285
00:18:07.333 --> 00:18:08.500
My gosh. I'm sorry!

286
00:18:08.583 --> 00:18:10.208
-For you this week. bro.
-Okay.

287
00:18:10.291 --> 00:18:11.666
-Some extra tip for you.
-Thank you.

288
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:14.000
-Thank you.
-See you!

289
00:18:14.083 --> 00:18:16.166
How can you sleep
after drinking coffee this late?

290
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:17.791
Wanna have a chat?

291
00:18:17.875 --> 00:18:18.833
No. I need to rest.

292
00:18:33.041 --> 00:18:33.916
It wasn't me.

293
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.666
No. I just want to assure her.

294
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:37.583
Who cares?

295
00:18:38.458 --> 00:18:40.708
Lemme know if the neighbors bully you.

296
00:18:40.791 --> 00:18:41.916
Ready to go down?

297
00:18:43.208 --> 00:18:45.250
Can you check my back?

298
00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:46.750
Need some special treatment again?

299
00:18:46.833 --> 00:18:48.166
Naughty hand!

300
00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:49.541
-Hands on your shoulders.
-Here?

301
00:18:49.625 --> 00:18:50.625
That's right.

302
00:18:50.708 --> 00:18:53.041
-Bend your legs.
-Legs are bent.

303
00:18:53.125 --> 00:18:54.958
-What are you doing?
-I'm doing what you tell me to.

304
00:18:55.041 --> 00:18:56.000
Come on!

305
00:18:57.291 --> 00:18:58.833
Stop leaving trash in front of my house.

306
00:19:01.666 --> 00:19:05.500
It wasn't me. Someone put it here.
I'm just tidying it up.

307
00:19:05.583 --> 00:19:08.333
-No. it was you. Mommy.
-Hey. don't say that.

308
00:19:08.416 --> 00:19:10.041
She doesn't know what she's saying.

309
00:19:10.125 --> 00:19:11.750
It's only a few steps
from the designated area.

310
00:19:11.833 --> 00:19:13.000
We're all adults here.

311
00:19:13.083 --> 00:19:15.041
What a big misunderstanding!

312
00:19:15.125 --> 00:19:17.750
It's not because I don't want to pay
for trash that I put them here. I just…

313
00:19:17.833 --> 00:19:19.000
What's going on?

314
00:19:19.083 --> 00:19:22.125
She thinks I leave trash in front
of her house to avoid paying for it.

315
00:19:22.208 --> 00:19:23.458
How could you?

316
00:19:23.541 --> 00:19:25.625
And stop letting your dog poop
in front of my house as well.

317
00:19:25.708 --> 00:19:28.166
Hey. did you see it?

318
00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:29.750
Don't accuse me if you didn't see it.

319
00:19:29.833 --> 00:19:31.875
You're the only one with a dog
on this floor.

320
00:19:31.958 --> 00:19:33.208
That's right.

321
00:19:33.291 --> 00:19:35.833
Hey. bitch. I'm not
the only one with a dog.

322
00:19:35.916 --> 00:19:37.916
There are lots of dogs on lots of floors.

323
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.583
You think they'd climb the stairs
just to poop?

324
00:19:39.666 --> 00:19:41.833
So what do you mean?

325
00:19:41.916 --> 00:19:43.791
You wanna cause trouble?

326
00:19:43.875 --> 00:19:45.416
It's her who has been trouble
from the start.

327
00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:46.333
You scared me.

328
00:19:46.416 --> 00:19:49.583
There's been trouble
ever since she moved here.

329
00:19:49.666 --> 00:19:50.958
Let me tell you.

330
00:19:51.041 --> 00:19:54.875
She said my dog poops in front
of her house even though she never saw it.

331
00:19:54.958 --> 00:19:57.333
It's not only about your dog.
She even seduces my husband.

332
00:19:57.416 --> 00:20:00.125
-Isn't that scary?
-Fine. fine.

333
00:20:00.208 --> 00:20:02.250
-It's my fault. I'm sorry.
-Obviously.

334
00:20:02.333 --> 00:20:03.958
I'll just clean it.

335
00:20:04.041 --> 00:20:05.625
She apologized. Let's go.

336
00:20:05.708 --> 00:20:08.041
-Ten year time is not that long.
-I could lose my husband in a year.

337
00:20:08.125 --> 00:20:09.833
-Did you hear what she said?
-We're all neighbors after all.

338
00:20:09.916 --> 00:20:10.958
These dogs…

339
00:20:11.041 --> 00:20:13.500
Hey. who's the dog?

340
00:20:13.583 --> 00:20:14.833
That's me.

341
00:20:15.458 --> 00:20:16.791
The dog is here.

342
00:20:16.875 --> 00:20:17.791
Calm down.

343
00:20:18.375 --> 00:20:20.166
Coming. Almost there.

344
00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:21.875
She called for me.

345
00:20:21.958 --> 00:20:23.625
I'm the dog.

346
00:20:24.333 --> 00:20:25.375
Ms. Nga.

347
00:20:25.458 --> 00:20:27.791
You're much prettier than a dog.

348
00:20:28.375 --> 00:20:30.125
Go on your way. sis Phung. You're so nosy.

349
00:20:30.208 --> 00:20:31.291
I'm not free. I have stuff to do.

350
00:20:31.375 --> 00:20:33.375
-It's a good thing you're handsome.
-Got it.

351
00:20:33.458 --> 00:20:34.458
Go on home.

352
00:20:34.541 --> 00:20:36.708
I'm not going home.
I've gotta go get food.

353
00:20:36.791 --> 00:20:38.166
Damn you.

354
00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:40.500
Home time. Let's go kid.

355
00:20:40.583 --> 00:20:42.041
-It wasn't me.
-She's starving.

356
00:20:42.125 --> 00:20:43.000
-Tell her.
-Okay.

357
00:20:43.083 --> 00:20:44.541
-It wasn't me.
-You're a good person.

358
00:20:44.625 --> 00:20:45.583
Tell her.

359
00:20:45.666 --> 00:20:47.791
Why do you need to tell her?
Just let her be.

360
00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:52.250
I'll clean it later.

361
00:20:52.333 --> 00:20:55.000
-It's okay.
-Just leave it. I'll clean it.

362
00:20:55.958 --> 00:20:57.166
Come on.

363
00:21:00.583 --> 00:21:03.583
The hunter just saved the sheep
from the wolves.

364
00:21:03.666 --> 00:21:04.958
He deserves a drink inside.

365
00:21:05.041 --> 00:21:07.958
Hey. I'm late for work.

366
00:21:08.041 --> 00:21:10.333
I'm grateful. but I don't have time
for any drink.

367
00:21:12.333 --> 00:21:14.125
-Hey. miss neighbor.
-What?

368
00:21:15.083 --> 00:21:16.416
A new fish tank.

369
00:21:18.125 --> 00:21:19.041
Kitty.

370
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.250
Puppy needs a f…

371
00:21:22.333 --> 00:21:24.041
friend.

372
00:21:24.791 --> 00:21:26.000
Take them.

373
00:21:27.041 --> 00:21:28.291
Please.

374
00:21:30.083 --> 00:21:31.625
Pretty doggy mommy.

375
00:21:32.458 --> 00:21:34.458
Kitty really wants to meet Puppy.

376
00:21:34.541 --> 00:21:37.041
Kitty's lonely. Kitty is Puppy's ex…

377
00:21:37.125 --> 00:21:38.416
Fine. fine.

378
00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.375
Thank you.

379
00:21:40.458 --> 00:21:41.916
What a silly story!

380
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
You have to let me take you to work.

381
00:21:47.541 --> 00:21:49.041
I just helped you.

382
00:21:49.125 --> 00:21:50.416
You can't say no.

383
00:21:56.208 --> 00:21:58.250
Thank you.

384
00:21:58.333 --> 00:22:00.000
Please give me a five-star rating.

385
00:22:01.708 --> 00:22:03.166
Ut. here's your banh mi.

386
00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:05.083
Thank you. Oh. here you go.

387
00:22:05.166 --> 00:22:07.791
Civet coffee. I brewed it myself.

388
00:22:07.875 --> 00:22:10.541
Five bucks a kilo. I'm not sure it's
the real deal since it was that cheap.

389
00:22:10.625 --> 00:22:12.333
I don't think it is then.

390
00:22:12.416 --> 00:22:13.500
Still tastes good though.

391
00:22:14.125 --> 00:22:15.458
I'll head in then.

392
00:22:15.541 --> 00:22:17.125
Hey. Mai!

393
00:22:18.125 --> 00:22:20.208
Oh! Dao!

394
00:22:20.291 --> 00:22:23.041
How could you move here
without telling me?

395
00:22:23.125 --> 00:22:25.333
Not yet. I'm talking.

396
00:22:25.416 --> 00:22:27.750
Not yet. I'm fixing my make up.

397
00:22:27.833 --> 00:22:29.458
Hang on! Not yet!

398
00:22:31.833 --> 00:22:34.916
I've been swamped ever since I moved here.

399
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.291
I'm sorry.

400
00:22:36.375 --> 00:22:37.875
I thought you forgot about me.

401
00:22:38.375 --> 00:22:40.500
You're the only one who can satisfy me.

402
00:22:40.583 --> 00:22:43.291
I can live without men.
but I can't live without you.

403
00:22:43.375 --> 00:22:44.958
How is it here?

404
00:22:46.083 --> 00:22:48.458
It's not bad. People like me here.

405
00:22:48.541 --> 00:22:49.541
Mai. you bitch!

406
00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:57.625
Now. I'm sure
you're trying to ruin my life.

407
00:23:00.583 --> 00:23:02.041
Hey. Diem.

408
00:23:02.125 --> 00:23:03.375
is it your turn?

409
00:23:03.458 --> 00:23:04.708
Still no.

410
00:23:04.791 --> 00:23:08.083
I get bumped every time
it gets to my turn.

411
00:23:08.166 --> 00:23:09.458
Mai is taking all the slots.

412
00:23:10.166 --> 00:23:12.000
Mai. come work for me.

413
00:23:12.791 --> 00:23:14.750
-For real?
-Of course.

414
00:23:14.833 --> 00:23:17.083
None of my relatives can help my business.

415
00:23:17.166 --> 00:23:18.750
I trust you.

416
00:23:18.833 --> 00:23:20.041
Okay?

417
00:23:20.125 --> 00:23:22.583
It's tempting but nah.

418
00:23:22.666 --> 00:23:23.541
Why?

419
00:23:24.458 --> 00:23:26.500
You're the only friend
I have here in Saigon.

420
00:23:26.583 --> 00:23:29.000
And when money's involved.
it gets complicated.

421
00:23:29.083 --> 00:23:30.416
Just let me be

422
00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:32.416
your little sister.

423
00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:33.958
Stop chatting.

424
00:23:34.041 --> 00:23:35.750
Remember to turn off the lights
when you leave.

425
00:23:35.833 --> 00:23:37.416
I got yelled at for three days straight.

426
00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:41.166
Hey. Tu. how can Mai cut
in front of everyone?

427
00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:43.125
She's not.
She's being requested by clients.

428
00:23:43.208 --> 00:23:44.583
Get requested… then I'll bump you up.

429
00:23:44.666 --> 00:23:48.416
Tu. I'm old. I can't compete with her.
She's sneaky.

430
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.458
-That's the rule.
-Tu!

431
00:23:50.541 --> 00:23:51.958
I forgot to give you a gift
on your birthday.

432
00:23:52.041 --> 00:23:53.666
-Don't do that.
-Here.

433
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:54.958
Don't do that.

434
00:23:55.041 --> 00:23:56.125
No.

435
00:23:59.333 --> 00:24:00.625
Don't do that.

436
00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:12.666
Step back. fatty!

437
00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:14.833
You're taking up too much space!

438
00:24:16.375 --> 00:24:19.750
Hey. find a rich shoulder to lean on.

439
00:24:21.208 --> 00:24:23.500
You know all about me.
and you still say that?

440
00:24:23.583 --> 00:24:26.125
I don't have any feelings for men.

441
00:24:27.041 --> 00:24:28.666
Okay. I see.

442
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:30.041
A client is hitting on me.

443
00:24:30.125 --> 00:24:31.875
He thinks he's so fine.

444
00:24:31.958 --> 00:24:34.041
But is he?

445
00:24:34.125 --> 00:24:35.875
-Kinda.
-Get him then.

446
00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:39.208
You're fine. he's fine. a perfect match!

447
00:24:39.291 --> 00:24:40.208
Go ahead!

448
00:24:40.291 --> 00:24:41.958
-How am I fine?
-Right here.

449
00:24:43.791 --> 00:24:46.500
-Are they real?
-Real foam.

450
00:24:46.583 --> 00:24:47.625
Foam but real?

451
00:24:47.708 --> 00:24:49.708
-These are the real deal.
-Hey. there!

452
00:24:49.791 --> 00:24:50.708
So naughty!

453
00:24:50.791 --> 00:24:52.666
How's Binh Minh?

454
00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:55.750
She's been so needy lately.

455
00:24:55.833 --> 00:24:58.583
wanting to get a job.
so people don't call her a freeloader.

456
00:24:58.666 --> 00:25:00.125
How sweet!

457
00:25:00.208 --> 00:25:01.833
Let her help.

458
00:25:01.916 --> 00:25:02.875
She's your man.

459
00:25:03.958 --> 00:25:07.333
-It's hard to do everything by yourself.
-I know. I know.

460
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.125
Trinh!

461
00:25:10.958 --> 00:25:12.083
What's going on?

462
00:25:17.666 --> 00:25:18.708
Diem…

463
00:25:18.791 --> 00:25:20.208
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

464
00:25:20.291 --> 00:25:21.583
What are we thinking?

465
00:25:22.875 --> 00:25:24.500
I hate Mai so much.

466
00:25:26.625 --> 00:25:27.541
I…

467
00:25:54.875 --> 00:25:57.666
Why didn't you let me know
you've moved to Go Vap?

468
00:25:59.000 --> 00:25:59.916
Nam…

469
00:26:00.875 --> 00:26:02.291
Are you hiding from me?

470
00:26:02.375 --> 00:26:03.416
‎No. sir.

471
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.500
It hurts.

472
00:26:09.583 --> 00:26:11.541
You're hurting me!

473
00:26:11.625 --> 00:26:13.833
Let's talk. It hurts so much.

474
00:26:13.916 --> 00:26:16.083
Damn…

475
00:26:18.583 --> 00:26:20.125
I'm trying to make money.

476
00:26:20.208 --> 00:26:21.791
How?

477
00:26:23.291 --> 00:26:25.708
Mai will pay it.

478
00:26:25.791 --> 00:26:28.250
-Mai will pay?
-Yes. of course.

479
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.500
You should have told me earlier.

480
00:26:32.583 --> 00:26:34.291
If not. I would have thought
you're on the run.

481
00:26:34.375 --> 00:26:35.458
Got it?

482
00:26:41.083 --> 00:26:43.208
-I'm heading out.
-Okay.

483
00:26:43.291 --> 00:26:44.541
Bye. Lanh.

484
00:26:47.416 --> 00:26:49.125
What did you look at me for
when I was working?

485
00:26:50.708 --> 00:26:52.083
I know you know.

486
00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:55.708
Know what?

487
00:26:56.666 --> 00:26:59.041
Don't do that here.

488
00:27:01.041 --> 00:27:02.333
Let me see you out.

489
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.666
This job is scandalous enough.

490
00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:18.375
I don't want people to think
everyone is like you.

491
00:27:18.458 --> 00:27:20.958
Everyone needs this job to survive.

492
00:27:21.041 --> 00:27:22.958
So everyone needs this job to survive.

493
00:27:23.041 --> 00:27:24.333
but I don't?

494
00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:29.625
I hate bitches that preach moral lessons.

495
00:27:29.708 --> 00:27:32.208
You take all the clients from me
and then talk down to me?

496
00:27:32.291 --> 00:27:33.833
You're amazing. Mai.

497
00:27:34.583 --> 00:27:36.750
I need the job. not the drama.

498
00:27:38.583 --> 00:27:40.250
Now. tell me…

499
00:27:41.166 --> 00:27:42.583
How much do they have to pay

500
00:27:42.666 --> 00:27:44.916
for you to open your mouth?

501
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.500
What do you want?

502
00:27:58.333 --> 00:27:59.250
Trinh!

503
00:28:00.416 --> 00:28:02.666
Is that your bike downstairs?

504
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:04.166
Yeah.

505
00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:05.833
Yeah. that would be mine.

506
00:28:05.916 --> 00:28:07.416
Why did you leave it there?

507
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.541
I was late and in a rush.

508
00:28:09.625 --> 00:28:11.708
Move it then. It caught me off guard.

509
00:28:11.791 --> 00:28:13.041
-I'll head out soon.
-Okay.

510
00:28:16.541 --> 00:28:17.791
I really did want to hit you.

511
00:28:20.083 --> 00:28:21.958
-Bye.
-Okay.

512
00:28:23.375 --> 00:28:24.416
What was she doing to you?

513
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:28.000
-It's okay.
-Let me know right away.

514
00:28:28.083 --> 00:28:30.166
-Sure.
-I've been watching her.

515
00:28:42.791 --> 00:28:46.000
ARE YOU HOME YET? WANT SOME FOOD?

516
00:28:46.083 --> 00:28:47.750
I'M HOME BUT TIRED. G9.

517
00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:01.333
HEY! HANG ON! I WANNA…

518
00:29:01.416 --> 00:29:04.416
BINH MINH

519
00:29:17.291 --> 00:29:18.666
Be careful!

520
00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:20.208
What are you doing down there?

521
00:29:20.291 --> 00:29:22.583
I was holding the chair for you.

522
00:29:22.666 --> 00:29:26.583
It's dangerous for a girl
to climb that high up.

523
00:29:26.666 --> 00:29:29.458
The wire is just a little loose.

524
00:29:29.541 --> 00:29:30.500
Go get some tape.

525
00:29:30.583 --> 00:29:32.458
I'll fix it for you.

526
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.375
-Oh. okay.
-Yeah. go get it.

527
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.708
Hey. what are you doing?

528
00:30:05.375 --> 00:30:06.791
I like you.

529
00:30:06.875 --> 00:30:08.666
I'll scream.

530
00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:10.250
Don't.

531
00:30:10.333 --> 00:30:11.583
I know what you do.

532
00:30:11.666 --> 00:30:12.791
How much? Tell me.

533
00:30:12.875 --> 00:30:14.916
You pervert!

534
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.500
Hey. stay away from me!

535
00:30:16.583 --> 00:30:18.125
Don't scream. Listen to me.

536
00:30:18.208 --> 00:30:19.708
Stay away!

537
00:30:19.791 --> 00:30:21.625
Don't run.

538
00:30:21.708 --> 00:30:23.083
-Calm down.
-What is it?

539
00:30:23.166 --> 00:30:25.000
-What's wrong?
-He's harassing me.

540
00:30:25.666 --> 00:30:27.291
Calm down. Let's talk this out.

541
00:30:27.375 --> 00:30:29.083
It's not what you're thinking. Hey!

542
00:30:29.166 --> 00:30:30.083
Ouch!

543
00:30:30.166 --> 00:30:32.666
I got hit. You need
to protect me. Officer.

544
00:30:33.833 --> 00:30:36.583
-Did you break in to her house?
-Answer.

545
00:30:36.666 --> 00:30:39.458
Hey. you punched me in the face.
Don't talk to me like that.

546
00:30:39.541 --> 00:30:41.166
Officer. look at him.

547
00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:43.500
I ask again. did you break into her house?

548
00:30:43.583 --> 00:30:45.708
I know it. but I was hit. Officer.

549
00:30:45.791 --> 00:30:47.666
The two of them planned to harm me…

550
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:49.833
They asked if you broke in to her house!

551
00:30:49.916 --> 00:30:53.083
I know it. but I was hit.
Why don't you ask him instead of me?

552
00:30:53.166 --> 00:30:55.583
Last time. did you break in to her house?

553
00:30:55.666 --> 00:30:58.958
I know. but it hurts so bad.
So no one cares about me?

554
00:30:59.041 --> 00:31:00.125
So you wanna fight again?

555
00:31:00.208 --> 00:31:02.583
‎Stop it!

556
00:31:04.416 --> 00:31:06.500
-He's attacking my husband!
-Calm down! Stop!

557
00:31:06.583 --> 00:31:08.375
Stop! Calm down! Calm down!

558
00:31:08.458 --> 00:31:10.458
-He hit me!
-I got it! Got it!

559
00:31:10.541 --> 00:31:11.666
My gosh!

560
00:31:12.458 --> 00:31:14.000
GIAI KY NOODLES

561
00:31:14.083 --> 00:31:16.333
If you hadn't stopped me. that would
have been the last time he could talk.

562
00:31:16.416 --> 00:31:17.708
Okay. okay. my hero!

563
00:31:17.791 --> 00:31:18.916
Have a seat.

564
00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:21.583
How could you find a place this late?

565
00:31:21.666 --> 00:31:23.166
You like it?

566
00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:25.333
I'm better than Google Maps.

567
00:31:25.416 --> 00:31:27.458
Obviously. you've taken enough girls out
to know places.

568
00:31:27.541 --> 00:31:30.000
It's a miracle I go out with you
at this hour.

569
00:31:30.083 --> 00:31:33.083
No one talks
to their benefactor like that.

570
00:31:33.166 --> 00:31:35.458
Fine. okay. thank you so much.

571
00:31:35.541 --> 00:31:37.083
Isn't that sweet?

572
00:31:37.666 --> 00:31:39.083
You can call me "Sau" (worm) from now on.

573
00:31:39.166 --> 00:31:40.958
What? Sau?

574
00:31:41.041 --> 00:31:43.125
That's right. my nickname at home.

575
00:31:44.166 --> 00:31:45.416
That's a weird name.

576
00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:47.916
Let's order.
They have amazing rice noodles.

577
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.333
-Hey.
-Yes?

578
00:31:49.416 --> 00:31:51.375
-Two special dry noodles.
-Okay.

579
00:31:51.458 --> 00:31:53.041
-Serve her well. She's my boss.
-Got it.

580
00:31:53.708 --> 00:31:55.708
How can you talk like that?

581
00:31:55.791 --> 00:31:57.208
He's just a worker. same like us.

582
00:31:57.291 --> 00:31:59.791
Can you add "please"
at the end of the sentence. please?

583
00:31:59.875 --> 00:32:01.375
-Hey.
-Yes?

584
00:32:01.458 --> 00:32:03.166
Two bowls of dry noodles… please!

585
00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:04.708
-Got it.
-Thank you.

586
00:32:04.791 --> 00:32:05.833
How's that?

587
00:32:06.583 --> 00:32:07.916
How old are you to be so serious?

588
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.125
How old are you to ask me such a question?

589
00:32:11.208 --> 00:32:12.666
I know I look young.

590
00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:14.708
but I'm turning 30 this year.

591
00:32:14.791 --> 00:32:17.291
You have no idea
what a "young" person looks like.

592
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000
What about you?

593
00:32:19.083 --> 00:32:21.666
Oh. I'm only seven years… older than you.

594
00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:23.208
37.

595
00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:26.083
With that face?

596
00:32:27.416 --> 00:32:28.916
I'll take that as another compliment.

597
00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.083
I know you're kidding.

598
00:32:31.166 --> 00:32:33.500
Do I look like I am?

599
00:32:34.041 --> 00:32:35.791
Show some respect for your elders.

600
00:32:35.875 --> 00:32:38.333
How can I call you an elder
when I'm having a crush on you?

601
00:32:38.416 --> 00:32:40.333
That's gonna lead us nowhere.

602
00:32:40.416 --> 00:32:42.041
We'd better keep things the same.

603
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:44.958
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

604
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:47.291
-Do you have coffee?
-We do.

605
00:32:47.375 --> 00:32:48.750
One black coffee. no sugar. please.

606
00:32:48.833 --> 00:32:49.958
Sure. just a moment.

607
00:32:50.041 --> 00:32:51.458
Why would you drink that?

608
00:32:51.541 --> 00:32:53.125
How can you sleep?

609
00:32:53.208 --> 00:32:55.416
It's just my habit. I can sleep just fine.

610
00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:58.000
That's how the miserables look like.

611
00:32:58.916 --> 00:33:00.416
Your life would be better with me in it.

612
00:33:02.125 --> 00:33:03.166
Sure. let's eat.

613
00:33:13.125 --> 00:33:14.416
Thank you.

614
00:33:18.708 --> 00:33:20.333
Do I look like a hooker?

615
00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:22.666
What now?

616
00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:25.958
Why does everyone think I'm a dirty girl?

617
00:33:26.041 --> 00:33:27.583
I wouldn't hit on a dirty girl.

618
00:33:28.166 --> 00:33:29.375
I'm not kidding.

619
00:33:29.458 --> 00:33:31.000
Neither am I.

620
00:33:31.083 --> 00:33:33.458
Why did you get handsy
when you first met me?

621
00:33:33.541 --> 00:33:37.333
I was handsy because you're pretty.
not because you're dirty.

622
00:33:38.541 --> 00:33:39.958
Fine.

623
00:33:40.041 --> 00:33:42.416
I admit that I was a bad person.

624
00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.833
I wasn't polite enough. I'm sorry.

625
00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:47.291
You can see I stopped being handsy.

626
00:33:47.375 --> 00:33:49.208
You'd better stay that way.

627
00:33:49.291 --> 00:33:50.375
I will.

628
00:33:52.791 --> 00:33:55.166
-Why don't you pick up your mom's call?
-How do you know?

629
00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:57.583
It's a privilege to have a family
who cares about you.

630
00:33:57.666 --> 00:34:00.000
-What if it's something urgent?
-Okay. okay.

631
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.291
-Yes. MaMi?
-Are you ever gonna come home?

632
00:34:05.041 --> 00:34:06.041
What do you mean?

633
00:34:06.125 --> 00:34:09.958
Ever since you moved out.
you've forgotten all about us.

634
00:34:10.041 --> 00:34:11.541
-I know. I know.
-Come on. stop.

635
00:34:11.625 --> 00:34:14.416
-I'll make some time to come home.
-Nah. do what you want.

636
00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:15.666
I'm angry now.

637
00:34:16.625 --> 00:34:18.041
‎Oh God!

638
00:34:18.125 --> 00:34:20.000
MaMi said she misses me

639
00:34:20.083 --> 00:34:22.500
and told me to bring my girlfriend around.

640
00:34:23.083 --> 00:34:24.833
You don't look like
the love-your-mom type.

641
00:34:24.916 --> 00:34:26.375
You're judging me.

642
00:34:27.541 --> 00:34:29.458
What does a love-your-mom face look like?

643
00:34:29.541 --> 00:34:32.083
Don't expect people not to judge you
when you're judging people.

644
00:34:33.791 --> 00:34:35.458
Don't give me that smile.

645
00:34:35.541 --> 00:34:36.875
Go on another ride with me instead.

646
00:34:36.958 --> 00:34:38.583
Learn how to pay your benefactor back.

647
00:34:38.666 --> 00:34:41.166
Nah. it's late.

648
00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:42.250
I'm tired.

649
00:34:42.333 --> 00:34:44.458
-Tomorrow.
-Tomorrow again?

650
00:34:44.541 --> 00:34:46.083
I know the name "Mai" means tomorrow.

651
00:34:46.166 --> 00:34:48.416
but I'll have your mom
change it to "okay" if I meet her.

652
00:34:49.208 --> 00:34:50.416
Don't freaking lie!

653
00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:52.708
Did she lure you in.
or did you go in by yourself?

654
00:34:52.791 --> 00:34:55.083
Of course. she lured me in.
I'm a married man.

655
00:34:55.166 --> 00:34:56.333
Cuong. you tell her. please.

656
00:34:56.416 --> 00:34:57.458
I think she's right.

657
00:34:57.541 --> 00:35:00.208
-What can we do now?
-Wanna do me?

658
00:35:00.291 --> 00:35:02.583
Watch your mouth. Lose that tone.

659
00:35:02.666 --> 00:35:04.583
-You hit me. asshole! Remember my face!
-What?

660
00:35:04.666 --> 00:35:06.833
-What do you want?
-Let go of me!

661
00:35:06.916 --> 00:35:08.750
-You think I'm scared?
-Stop!

662
00:35:08.833 --> 00:35:09.958
Let him go.

663
00:35:10.041 --> 00:35:11.583
I wanna see what he's gonna do.

664
00:35:11.666 --> 00:35:14.833
You talk a big talk for your size.

665
00:35:16.916 --> 00:35:18.333
Another one.

666
00:35:21.333 --> 00:35:22.208
Are you okay?

667
00:35:22.291 --> 00:35:24.833
Don't underestimate me.

668
00:35:24.916 --> 00:35:26.458
I'm a good drinker.

669
00:35:26.541 --> 00:35:28.208
It's just that I quit drinking
a long time ago.

670
00:35:28.291 --> 00:35:29.791
So open your eyes wide if you can.

671
00:35:31.791 --> 00:35:33.250
Keep them there.

672
00:35:35.041 --> 00:35:36.458
It's really cute here.

673
00:35:37.041 --> 00:35:39.041
I'm starting to like the bartender.

674
00:35:39.125 --> 00:35:42.208
so try to be more professional.

675
00:35:42.291 --> 00:35:44.250
Who told you I'm a bartender?

676
00:35:49.708 --> 00:35:51.333
It's nice!

677
00:35:52.625 --> 00:35:55.041
I work here. not over there.

678
00:35:55.125 --> 00:35:56.041
Here?

679
00:36:47.125 --> 00:36:48.458
That was great.

680
00:36:49.083 --> 00:36:50.458
"The Autumn Clouds." right?

681
00:36:50.958 --> 00:36:51.791
How did you know?

682
00:36:53.416 --> 00:36:56.666
My mom used to listen
to Tu Cong Phung's songs.

683
00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:59.458
Nice. I didn't think you'd know this song.

684
00:36:59.541 --> 00:37:01.041
You're judging me now.

685
00:37:01.541 --> 00:37:03.458
A masseuse can't listen to music?

686
00:37:03.541 --> 00:37:05.291
I meant only older people
like these songs.

687
00:37:05.375 --> 00:37:06.875
You're judging me again.

688
00:37:06.958 --> 00:37:08.375
You're calling me old?

689
00:37:08.458 --> 00:37:12.208
Come on! I mean why would
someone your age listen to these songs.

690
00:37:12.291 --> 00:37:14.875
meaning you have good taste. young lady.

691
00:37:15.625 --> 00:37:16.916
Fine.

692
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.500
Keep playing. brother.

693
00:37:24.791 --> 00:37:26.750
-Cheers!
-Cheers! Damn. you drink a lot!

694
00:37:26.833 --> 00:37:28.166
I told you I'm a good drinker.

695
00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:29.375
What an alcoholic!

696
00:37:31.416 --> 00:37:33.375
-Play more songs.
-I'm out of songs.

697
00:37:33.458 --> 00:37:36.500
Of course. you have more.
Do something interesting!

698
00:37:38.041 --> 00:37:39.291
Hang on!

699
00:37:51.208 --> 00:37:52.500
Milady!

700
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.750
Are you crazy?

701
00:38:00.375 --> 00:38:01.500
Milady.

702
00:38:01.583 --> 00:38:03.250
Would you care for a dance?

703
00:38:03.333 --> 00:38:05.500
Nah. I don't dance.

704
00:38:05.583 --> 00:38:07.000
Are you lying?

705
00:38:07.083 --> 00:38:09.333
You're crazy! I can't dance.

706
00:38:09.416 --> 00:38:12.791
You're old now. You'll get a belly
if you don't exercise.

707
00:38:13.416 --> 00:38:15.458
How dare you say that to a pretty woman!

708
00:38:15.541 --> 00:38:17.625
-So can I dance with you as an apology?
-I told you I can't dance.

709
00:38:17.708 --> 00:38:19.458
If you don't dance.
I'll take you to see the noodle man.

710
00:38:19.541 --> 00:38:21.083
You're insane!

711
00:38:23.875 --> 00:38:24.958
What?

712
00:39:26.541 --> 00:39:28.250
‎Perfect couple!

713
00:39:38.291 --> 00:39:39.541
What a nice couple you are!

714
00:39:39.625 --> 00:39:41.291
You're so pretty. Mai!

715
00:39:41.375 --> 00:39:43.250
Kiss! Kiss!

716
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.458
‎Lady!

717
00:39:55.666 --> 00:39:56.791
Ew!

718
00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.375
I'm done. so tired.

719
00:39:59.458 --> 00:40:02.916
-Get up! It's not over yet!
-I'm old. Leave me alone.

720
00:40:16.375 --> 00:40:17.416
Are you okay?

721
00:40:18.166 --> 00:40:19.916
Can you still work?

722
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.583
Here comes the yawn.

723
00:40:22.541 --> 00:40:23.666
I'm fine.

724
00:40:25.541 --> 00:40:27.208
Hey!

725
00:40:27.291 --> 00:40:28.541
Binh Minh!

726
00:40:42.708 --> 00:40:44.375
What's wrong?

727
00:40:44.458 --> 00:40:46.166
Why didn't you call me?

728
00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:47.541
I did. You didn't pick up.

729
00:40:48.125 --> 00:40:50.666
-Were you drinking?
-Just a little bit.

730
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:51.916
Who's this?

731
00:40:54.041 --> 00:40:55.708
Binh Minh. my daughter…

732
00:40:55.791 --> 00:40:56.791
my biological daughter.

733
00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:00.000
Sorry.

734
00:41:00.083 --> 00:41:02.625
Mai. I need to talk to you.

735
00:41:04.083 --> 00:41:06.083
-Good morning. sir.
-All right.

736
00:41:06.166 --> 00:41:08.208
Too much information for one day. right?

737
00:41:08.291 --> 00:41:10.083
Go home if you want to have
a family meeting.

738
00:41:10.166 --> 00:41:11.875
Clear the way!

739
00:41:11.958 --> 00:41:13.333
No need to be that aggressive.

740
00:41:13.416 --> 00:41:16.041
You're ruining my morning. Move. Go away.

741
00:41:16.125 --> 00:41:18.750
Do you want me to call the Officer?

742
00:41:19.333 --> 00:41:20.208
‎Come on. let's go!

743
00:41:20.291 --> 00:41:21.500
I will. I will.

744
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.083
Again?

745
00:41:28.666 --> 00:41:30.500
How many times have you promised to stop?

746
00:41:31.541 --> 00:41:33.625
Stop driving me insane.

747
00:41:34.208 --> 00:41:35.750
How dare she treat her dad like that!

748
00:41:35.833 --> 00:41:37.291
She looks ungrateful.

749
00:41:37.375 --> 00:41:38.708
Shut up and listen.

750
00:41:38.791 --> 00:41:39.958
Look at this.

751
00:41:40.041 --> 00:41:42.125
How much in total already?

752
00:41:43.541 --> 00:41:45.500
You were working so hard.

753
00:41:45.583 --> 00:41:49.958
My friends said Barcelona was doing well.
I didn't think I'd lose that much.

754
00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:53.250
I wouldn't be reaching out
if it wasn't dangerous.

755
00:41:53.333 --> 00:41:54.291
They're…

756
00:41:54.375 --> 00:41:56.166
They're threatening Binh Minh.

757
00:42:04.958 --> 00:42:08.208
Why can't you quit gambling?

758
00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:14.916
-You're not in it. You wouldn't know.
-Who can actually know?

759
00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:16.500
Why do you keep…

760
00:42:16.583 --> 00:42:19.291
Why do you keep doing this to me?

761
00:42:23.375 --> 00:42:25.208
I know I'm wrong.

762
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:28.666
Please help me this time.

763
00:42:29.833 --> 00:42:31.500
-Please.
-How much?

764
00:42:31.583 --> 00:42:33.916
Around $2.500 dollars.

765
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.458
Otherwise. they're…

766
00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:38.041
It's fine if you don't want to.

767
00:42:51.291 --> 00:42:52.625
Drink some water.

768
00:42:52.708 --> 00:42:54.250
Stop acting.

769
00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:56.666
Take the money.

770
00:43:03.708 --> 00:43:04.916
I'm sorry.

771
00:43:06.583 --> 00:43:07.833
Some water?

772
00:43:13.041 --> 00:43:15.208
-I swear…
-Don't "I swear" to me.

773
00:43:15.291 --> 00:43:17.416
One more time and you're dead to me.

774
00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:19.583
Aunties. please make way.

775
00:43:19.666 --> 00:43:22.708
Why are you crowding
outside her house? Let's move.

776
00:43:22.791 --> 00:43:24.083
I'm moving. can't you see?

777
00:43:24.166 --> 00:43:25.458
Dismissed.

778
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000
Give me the keys. I'll head out first.

779
00:43:31.208 --> 00:43:33.875
Talk to your mom. She's mad at me.

780
00:43:38.291 --> 00:43:40.125
Drink this for the hangover.

781
00:43:40.208 --> 00:43:41.708
I know you're tired.

782
00:43:42.583 --> 00:43:44.166
I called you so many times yesterday.

783
00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:45.958
They were aggressive.

784
00:43:46.041 --> 00:43:47.416
Did they do anything to you?

785
00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:49.750
Not yet. but I'm not sure about later.

786
00:43:49.833 --> 00:43:51.500
But I think he'll quit for real this time.

787
00:43:51.583 --> 00:43:52.958
It was intense.

788
00:43:53.916 --> 00:43:56.416
Come live with me. Leave him.

789
00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:58.708
Get a boyfriend then I'll come.

790
00:43:58.791 --> 00:44:00.458
Again with this boyfriend thing…

791
00:44:01.333 --> 00:44:03.375
Why did I stay with him
and let you move out then?

792
00:44:03.458 --> 00:44:06.041
No one would hit on you
if I kept tagging along.

793
00:44:06.708 --> 00:44:08.833
You like the tall dude?

794
00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:12.083
Nah. he's just a neighbor.

795
00:44:12.166 --> 00:44:14.000
You pulled an all-nighter with a neighbor?

796
00:44:14.083 --> 00:44:15.625
I didn't.

797
00:44:15.708 --> 00:44:17.750
You don't have to deny it.

798
00:44:19.416 --> 00:44:20.750
I like you.

799
00:44:20.833 --> 00:44:21.791
I love you.

800
00:44:21.875 --> 00:44:23.916
We only need one lesbian in the house.

801
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:29.208
Get a boyfriend.

802
00:44:36.125 --> 00:44:38.083
Why did you grow up so fast?

803
00:44:40.625 --> 00:44:42.625
Because you don't want to be happy.

804
00:44:43.875 --> 00:44:45.875
Stop abusing yourself.

805
00:44:53.458 --> 00:44:55.208
Thank you. honey.

806
00:45:15.791 --> 00:45:18.500
‎Robber!

807
00:45:26.166 --> 00:45:27.750
‎Take a deep breath.

808
00:45:28.708 --> 00:45:29.875
‎Come on! Keep trying.

809
00:45:42.541 --> 00:45:46.041
Ouch. I'm bleeding. Mai.
What are you doing?

810
00:45:46.125 --> 00:45:47.583
My baby is crying. I'm sorry.

811
00:45:47.666 --> 00:45:49.500
I'll just go somewhere else.

812
00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:52.083
Miss…

813
00:45:52.166 --> 00:45:54.208
Just take care of your child.

814
00:45:54.291 --> 00:45:56.083
I can get right back to it.

815
00:45:59.666 --> 00:46:02.125
Hang on. stop crying. I'm trying.

816
00:46:02.791 --> 00:46:05.541
I said I know. Why are you still crying?

817
00:46:06.291 --> 00:46:07.958
What else do you want?

818
00:46:09.708 --> 00:46:12.000
Sis! Sis!

819
00:46:12.083 --> 00:46:13.958
-What's wrong?
-My baby has a fever.

820
00:46:14.041 --> 00:46:16.375
-Please take us to the hospital.
-Go get the keys.

821
00:46:29.375 --> 00:46:31.208
What happened? Are you okay?

822
00:46:31.291 --> 00:46:32.500
Why do you keep hitting my child?

823
00:46:32.583 --> 00:46:35.291
Mai. tell her to stay away from my kid.

824
00:46:35.375 --> 00:46:38.458
-Go home. sweetie!
-It's just kids playing around. I'm sorry.

825
00:46:38.541 --> 00:46:39.791
It's okay. baby. it's okay.

826
00:46:39.875 --> 00:46:41.458
Let me see. baby.

827
00:46:44.916 --> 00:46:45.958
Mai!

828
00:46:47.166 --> 00:46:50.625
They seized my house. Can I live with you?

829
00:46:50.708 --> 00:46:52.333
Don't be mad.

830
00:46:53.541 --> 00:46:54.916
That's your daughter?

831
00:46:56.250 --> 00:46:58.791
Just a moment. She should be here soon.

832
00:47:00.583 --> 00:47:02.041
Why did you bring her?

833
00:47:03.958 --> 00:47:06.750
I'm in the wrong room. Excuse me.
Let's go.

834
00:47:06.833 --> 00:47:09.000
Please wait here. Mai! Mai!

835
00:47:09.083 --> 00:47:10.375
Binh Minh!

836
00:47:10.458 --> 00:47:12.833
Here. come dust this blanket for me.

837
00:47:12.916 --> 00:47:14.166
Mom?

838
00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:16.000
Why do we need to dust a clean blanket?

839
00:47:17.125 --> 00:47:18.958
Even the cleanest blanket is dusty.

840
00:47:19.041 --> 00:47:20.541
Help me. please.

841
00:47:22.875 --> 00:47:25.708
Even the cleanest blanket is dusty.

842
00:47:25.791 --> 00:47:27.458
Help me. please.

843
00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:32.166
I think I look like her more than you do.

844
00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:35.333
You get to work now. happy?

845
00:47:35.416 --> 00:47:37.791
I don't even know what to say.

846
00:47:37.875 --> 00:47:40.125
-Stop with the thanking.
-I…

847
00:47:40.208 --> 00:47:42.125
I'm helping my niece. not you.

848
00:47:42.208 --> 00:47:43.791
Just let her get some experience
working part-time here.

849
00:47:43.875 --> 00:47:45.875
then she can go wherever
when she gets a full-time job.

850
00:47:45.958 --> 00:47:48.083
I'd have to hire someone either way.

851
00:47:48.166 --> 00:47:49.875
-Here's your bill.
-What is this?

852
00:47:49.958 --> 00:47:53.000
-I have to pay for my coffee.
-Okay. pay away.

853
00:47:53.083 --> 00:47:55.541
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

854
00:47:55.625 --> 00:47:56.625
Where's the tip?

855
00:47:56.708 --> 00:47:59.041
Nope. only one of us can get tips.

856
00:47:59.125 --> 00:48:00.625
Pulling rank here?

857
00:48:01.125 --> 00:48:02.458
Here. this is for you.

858
00:48:02.958 --> 00:48:05.583
-What is this?
-Girls need a little bling to get a boy.

859
00:48:05.666 --> 00:48:07.208
You dress like my mom.

860
00:48:07.291 --> 00:48:10.041
-It's expensive. I don't want it.
-It's silver. It doesn't cost much.

861
00:48:10.125 --> 00:48:12.541
Silver? Can I get a ring too then?

862
00:48:12.625 --> 00:48:16.291
-It's white gold!
-See. such a simple test.

863
00:48:16.375 --> 00:48:18.708
It's not much at all. Just wear it--

864
00:48:18.791 --> 00:48:21.708
Thank you. Boss. for giving me
this nice job. I'll do my best.

865
00:48:22.291 --> 00:48:24.125
Oh. hey. leave the bike there.

866
00:48:24.208 --> 00:48:26.500
Go ahead. Head inside.

867
00:48:27.625 --> 00:48:28.833
Give me your bike.

868
00:48:28.916 --> 00:48:30.375
Go inside.

869
00:48:31.041 --> 00:48:32.416
-Hey. hey!
-What?

870
00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:33.791
Let me get the door for you.

871
00:48:33.875 --> 00:48:36.125
-It's automatic.
-Oh. is that so?

872
00:48:36.208 --> 00:48:37.916
So modern!

873
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.375
-Work hard. okay?
-This way!

874
00:48:41.291 --> 00:48:42.750
Safe travels!

875
00:48:42.833 --> 00:48:44.625
-Let me close the door.
-It's automatic.

876
00:48:44.708 --> 00:48:45.958
Oh. yeah. I forgot.

877
00:48:46.041 --> 00:48:47.208
That's nice.

878
00:48:47.875 --> 00:48:49.250
How's your boyfriend?

879
00:48:49.333 --> 00:48:50.541
He saw my kid and disappeared.

880
00:48:50.625 --> 00:48:52.125
Asshole. Is he ghosting you?

881
00:48:52.208 --> 00:48:54.458
-No. I'm ghosting him.
-What the heck?

882
00:48:54.541 --> 00:48:58.458
-Why are you ghosting him?
-I saw the pause. I know what that means.

883
00:48:58.541 --> 00:49:02.500
Hey. Mai. don't take it too seriously.

884
00:49:02.583 --> 00:49:06.000
He's young and free.
A child came out of nowhere.

885
00:49:06.083 --> 00:49:07.583
Of course. he's gonna pause.

886
00:49:07.666 --> 00:49:10.291
Give him time to process that.

887
00:49:10.375 --> 00:49:13.291
You have a child. You have the underhand.
Try to understand.

888
00:49:13.375 --> 00:49:14.666
I tried to understand.

889
00:49:15.333 --> 00:49:16.333
She's just eight years older than me.

890
00:49:16.416 --> 00:49:18.791
I think that's normal nowadays.

891
00:49:18.875 --> 00:49:20.625
As long as she's still hot.

892
00:49:20.708 --> 00:49:23.541
But she has an add-on.

893
00:49:23.625 --> 00:49:25.125
You're insane.

894
00:49:25.208 --> 00:49:26.833
Nope! You're in love.

895
00:49:26.916 --> 00:49:28.750
-Who said?
-Your eyes.

896
00:49:28.833 --> 00:49:31.708
-Don't hide things from me.
-I'm not.

897
00:49:31.791 --> 00:49:33.333
Yes. I am!

898
00:49:33.416 --> 00:49:35.416
-I'm serious this time.
-This is chaos!

899
00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:38.833
Lady killer. young. 6-pack owner

900
00:49:38.916 --> 00:49:41.708
versus a babysitter.
used. and eight years older.

901
00:49:41.791 --> 00:49:43.833
-So what?
-So fall in love.

902
00:49:45.125 --> 00:49:47.791
But he's too young. not the mature kind.

903
00:49:47.875 --> 00:49:50.416
Don't find a mature guy to love.
Just love him and he'll mature.

904
00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:51.916
She's mature.

905
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.791
and you're definitely hooked.

906
00:49:54.875 --> 00:49:56.166
She's just fishing.

907
00:49:56.250 --> 00:49:58.916
-You just got hooked.
-She's not like that.

908
00:49:59.583 --> 00:50:01.875
-What is she like then?
-Then he'll find you.

909
00:50:01.958 --> 00:50:03.375
Trust me.

910
00:50:03.958 --> 00:50:05.125
Of course. I trust you.

911
00:50:05.208 --> 00:50:06.250
Jerk!

912
00:50:06.333 --> 00:50:07.458
I haven't seen you in a while.

913
00:50:07.541 --> 00:50:09.458
You look handsome today.

914
00:50:09.541 --> 00:50:11.083
Have you booked anyone?

915
00:50:11.166 --> 00:50:12.458
Can I work on you?

916
00:50:15.208 --> 00:50:17.541
He'll look for you. believe me.
Just give him a chance.

917
00:50:17.625 --> 00:50:19.125
Drop your ego.

918
00:50:19.208 --> 00:50:20.708
Not yet. I'm coming.

919
00:50:20.791 --> 00:50:21.750
I'll head out then.

920
00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:24.125
Bye!

921
00:50:27.333 --> 00:50:28.333
Remember…

922
00:50:28.416 --> 00:50:29.458
Hurry up!

923
00:50:29.541 --> 00:50:31.041
I'm coming.

924
00:50:32.416 --> 00:50:35.166
I got it. I guarantee you'll be satisfied.

925
00:50:37.541 --> 00:50:39.041
Book Mai for me.

926
00:50:39.625 --> 00:50:41.208
She's busy today.

927
00:50:41.291 --> 00:50:44.125
-I can wait.
-Can you wait three or four rounds?

928
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.833
"Diem" is here for you.

929
00:50:46.916 --> 00:50:48.375
Let me serve you.

930
00:50:48.916 --> 00:50:50.041
Thank you.

931
00:50:50.125 --> 00:50:51.625
-I'll head out then.
-Okay.

932
00:50:52.333 --> 00:50:53.458
You wanna break the rules?

933
00:50:53.541 --> 00:50:55.416
Watch out!

934
00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:57.208
Okay. fine.

935
00:50:57.291 --> 00:50:59.958
-All the clients are Mai's.
-Thank you. sir. Come back soon.

936
00:51:00.041 --> 00:51:02.708
You think you can out-slut her
to take on her clients?

937
00:51:02.791 --> 00:51:04.083
Really?

938
00:51:04.166 --> 00:51:07.458
I don't think so. I think she's clean.

939
00:51:07.541 --> 00:51:08.875
She's not like that.

940
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:11.666
You're from the same hometown?

941
00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:15.791
Do you know why she's busy and you're not?

942
00:51:18.125 --> 00:51:19.958
It's because you don't have any tricks.

943
00:51:23.791 --> 00:51:25.958
-Have a good night.
-Thank you. Mai. This is for you.

944
00:51:26.041 --> 00:51:28.416
-You already tipped me.
-It's so late. Just take it.

945
00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:30.375
Thank you so much.

946
00:51:32.625 --> 00:51:34.708
-Take care of this for me. please.
-Sure.

947
00:51:35.416 --> 00:51:37.250
-Thank you.
-I'm heading out.

948
00:51:37.333 --> 00:51:38.875
Me too. You were my last client.

949
00:51:48.208 --> 00:51:49.041
‎Huh?

950
00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:52.166
Who locked the door?

951
00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:54.000
Hey!

952
00:51:55.166 --> 00:51:56.958
Anyone there?

953
00:51:58.958 --> 00:51:59.958
Who locked it?

954
00:52:00.041 --> 00:52:02.416
-Trinh. is this okay?
-Open up!

955
00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:05.208
Have you ever seen anyone die
from being locked in a bathroom?

956
00:52:05.291 --> 00:52:07.958
She took late clients
because she likes the dark.

957
00:52:08.041 --> 00:52:09.458
-Let's help her.
-Anyone?

958
00:52:09.541 --> 00:52:10.458
Tu!

959
00:52:10.541 --> 00:52:11.958
Tu said to turn off the lights.

960
00:52:12.041 --> 00:52:12.958
Uncle Ut!

961
00:52:13.041 --> 00:52:16.541
Hey. who's that? Open up!

962
00:52:16.625 --> 00:52:20.083
Uncle Ut!

963
00:52:23.416 --> 00:52:24.708
Is anyone out there?

964
00:52:24.791 --> 00:52:27.416
Anyone?

965
00:52:35.958 --> 00:52:37.791
SAU DAM
CALLING

966
00:52:39.416 --> 00:52:41.333
SAU DAM - 1 MISSED CALL
BINH MINH - 3 MISSED CALLS

967
00:52:53.666 --> 00:52:55.166
Mai?

968
00:52:55.250 --> 00:52:57.208
-Mai?
-Uncle Ut!

969
00:52:57.291 --> 00:52:58.791
-I'm in here.
-Where?

970
00:53:03.166 --> 00:53:05.541
Those two are unbelievable.

971
00:53:06.166 --> 00:53:07.875
Do you want me to tell the management?

972
00:53:07.958 --> 00:53:09.583
No…

973
00:53:09.666 --> 00:53:11.458
I don't want this to blow up.

974
00:53:11.541 --> 00:53:13.083
I'm okay.

975
00:53:14.041 --> 00:53:16.458
How did you know I was still here?

976
00:53:16.541 --> 00:53:19.875
You didn't say goodbye.
so I came looking for you.

977
00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:42.875
Thank you.

978
00:53:44.375 --> 00:53:46.791
Try to avoid them.

979
00:53:46.875 --> 00:53:49.833
They're mean.
Tell me if you need anything.

980
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.000
It would be good to have
a father like you.

981
00:53:56.625 --> 00:53:58.458
Is it not good now?

982
00:53:58.541 --> 00:54:00.083
Sleep well. daughter.

983
00:54:05.291 --> 00:54:06.875
Good night.

984
00:54:11.541 --> 00:54:13.333
You still up?

985
00:54:13.416 --> 00:54:14.875
Yeah.

986
00:54:15.875 --> 00:54:17.041
Hey. it's your girl!

987
00:54:18.125 --> 00:54:19.875
Is she turning you on?

988
00:54:21.541 --> 00:54:23.583
-I heard she's a hooker.
-Really?

989
00:54:24.250 --> 00:54:26.708
What? You're not answering.

990
00:54:28.125 --> 00:54:30.250
Why are people so mean to me?

991
00:54:30.333 --> 00:54:31.791
I didn't do anything.

992
00:54:31.875 --> 00:54:33.625
Why do they want to cause trouble?

993
00:54:33.708 --> 00:54:35.333
Of course. you didn't do anything.

994
00:54:35.416 --> 00:54:36.500
That's enough.

995
00:54:37.916 --> 00:54:40.083
Now. you're trying to cause trouble?

996
00:54:40.166 --> 00:54:41.666
This is hard liquor.

997
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:43.833
-That's why I'm drin--
-Stop.

998
00:54:45.916 --> 00:54:47.541
Why do you like me?

999
00:54:50.250 --> 00:54:51.958
Why are you avoiding me?

1000
00:54:52.541 --> 00:54:53.458
I'm not.

1001
00:54:53.541 --> 00:54:56.083
I'm asking you to be my drinking buddy.

1002
00:54:56.166 --> 00:54:57.625
Cheers!

1003
00:55:00.250 --> 00:55:01.375
You look funny when you're drunk.

1004
00:55:02.541 --> 00:55:04.125
Remember that night at the bar?

1005
00:55:05.041 --> 00:55:06.833
I haven't had that much fun in a while.

1006
00:55:08.291 --> 00:55:10.125
Why can't we still enjoy and have fun?

1007
00:55:11.041 --> 00:55:12.791
Because of your eyes.

1008
00:55:12.875 --> 00:55:14.125
My eyes?

1009
00:55:14.208 --> 00:55:16.666
They can't hide your emotions.

1010
00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:17.833
What emotions?

1011
00:55:17.916 --> 00:55:21.000
When you saw my daughter.

1012
00:55:21.083 --> 00:55:22.291
my dad.

1013
00:55:22.375 --> 00:55:23.416
if I could.

1014
00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:26.750
I wish I could have turned into a mirror.

1015
00:55:26.833 --> 00:55:29.333
so you could have seen
how your face looked like then.

1016
00:55:39.416 --> 00:55:40.583
Okay. to be honest.

1017
00:55:41.458 --> 00:55:42.625
I paused

1018
00:55:42.708 --> 00:55:44.583
because I didn't think she'd be that big.

1019
00:55:45.708 --> 00:55:47.333
I meant your daughter.

1020
00:55:47.916 --> 00:55:50.916
I didn't think you'd have
that old of a child.

1021
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.041
I thought about it a lot that night.

1022
00:55:53.125 --> 00:55:55.208
"It's just her child.

1023
00:55:55.291 --> 00:55:56.708
So what?

1024
00:55:57.291 --> 00:55:59.250
I've been with many girls.

1025
00:55:59.333 --> 00:56:01.833
so it's normal for her to have a child."

1026
00:56:01.916 --> 00:56:05.125
If your child was a toddler.

1027
00:56:05.208 --> 00:56:07.666
I admit I can't imagine

1028
00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:09.750
how I'd raise her with you.

1029
00:56:09.833 --> 00:56:11.750
Luckily. she's all grown up.

1030
00:56:12.333 --> 00:56:14.708
Let's just say I have a new friend.

1031
00:56:14.791 --> 00:56:17.708
It's easy to take care of a friend.

1032
00:56:17.791 --> 00:56:19.208
I love friends.

1033
00:56:19.291 --> 00:56:21.083
Every age has its difficulties.

1034
00:56:21.166 --> 00:56:22.750
It's not as simple as you think.

1035
00:56:22.833 --> 00:56:24.666
Can you please let me be responsible
for taking care of you two?

1036
00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:25.875
And stop shutting it down.

1037
00:56:27.416 --> 00:56:30.916
You're okay with me.
but your family won't be.

1038
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.583
Right? I've experienced it before.

1039
00:56:34.666 --> 00:56:36.625
There's your excuse.

1040
00:56:40.791 --> 00:56:42.666
So what do you want from me?

1041
00:56:44.416 --> 00:56:45.958
To be your boyfriend.

1042
00:56:53.708 --> 00:56:55.375
I know I'm a stubborn kid.

1043
00:56:56.875 --> 00:56:59.125
I always think about myself.

1044
00:57:00.333 --> 00:57:01.875
My mom always took care of me.

1045
00:57:01.958 --> 00:57:03.041
Since we're rich.

1046
00:57:03.125 --> 00:57:06.958
she wants me to do things her way.

1047
00:57:07.041 --> 00:57:09.583
But I hate that.

1048
00:57:09.666 --> 00:57:11.958
I want my own life.

1049
00:57:12.041 --> 00:57:13.750
I like to nurture my emotions.

1050
00:57:13.833 --> 00:57:15.083
Girls follow me.

1051
00:57:15.166 --> 00:57:16.833
Everything seems so easy.

1052
00:57:16.916 --> 00:57:18.875
That's why I took them for granted.

1053
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:22.208
Stop that! Bad guy!

1054
00:57:23.125 --> 00:57:24.458
I'm not denying it.

1055
00:57:24.541 --> 00:57:25.791
I know I'm bad.

1056
00:57:26.458 --> 00:57:28.375
But that was before I met you.

1057
00:57:30.291 --> 00:57:32.083
You've changed me.

1058
00:57:33.708 --> 00:57:35.625
Since meeting you.

1059
00:57:35.708 --> 00:57:37.708
I want to have a serious relationship.

1060
00:57:37.791 --> 00:57:40.291
and I really want to care for someone.

1061
00:57:50.250 --> 00:57:51.708
Don't love me.

1062
00:57:53.333 --> 00:57:54.791
My past is bad.

1063
00:57:59.083 --> 00:58:00.666
Don't give me hope.

1064
00:58:20.541 --> 00:58:22.166
‎Oh my Mai!

1065
00:58:27.708 --> 00:58:28.916
‎Let's go!

1066
00:58:30.541 --> 00:58:31.583
‎Watch out!

1067
00:58:35.541 --> 00:58:36.708
‎Come on. Sau!

1068
00:58:37.333 --> 00:58:39.208
‎Just get upstairs first.

1069
00:58:40.791 --> 00:58:41.625
‎Just go.

1070
00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:43.958
‎I'm drunk.

1071
00:59:12.125 --> 00:59:13.625
You okay?

1072
00:59:15.708 --> 00:59:17.833
Want someone to sleep with?

1073
00:59:25.333 --> 00:59:26.458
Mai!

1074
00:59:29.458 --> 00:59:31.083
Will we meet again?

1075
01:00:21.333 --> 01:00:22.708
It's okay.

1076
01:00:23.375 --> 01:00:25.125
It's fine.

1077
01:00:31.041 --> 01:00:33.083
You're a good guy.

1078
01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:40.791
-I appreciate it.
-This is dirty now.

1079
01:00:47.291 --> 01:00:48.416
Bye!

Were you disgusted by the vomit?

1086
01:01:43.041 --> 01:01:44.250
No.

1087
01:01:46.666 --> 01:01:47.791
Good.

1088
01:01:58.916 --> 01:02:00.041
Mai…

1089
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.458
Forget the past.

Wanna make a bet?

If I fail.

1092
01:02:09.083 --> 01:02:10.791
I'll be your recent past.

1093
01:02:12.333 --> 01:02:13.750
If I succeed.

1094
01:02:14.875 --> 01:02:16.750
we will be each others' new tomorrows.

1095

Would you dare…

1096
01:02:22.791 --> 01:02:23.875
to fall in love?

1097
01:02:31.791 --> 01:02:32.958
Don't…

1098
01:02:33.916 --> 01:02:35.166
Don't…

1099
01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:41.791
I'm ugly.

1100
01:02:47.333 --> 01:02:48.875
We don't have to.

1101
01:02:49.375 --> 01:02:51.041
It's okay. it's okay.

1102
01:02:51.125 --> 01:02:53.583
You're okay.

1103
01:02:53.666 --> 01:02:55.708
-You're okay.
-No. I want this.

1104
01:03:04.791 --> 01:03:05.916
Here.

1105
01:03:07.708 --> 01:03:09.250
From a fight when I was young.

1106
01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:11.666
This one.

1107
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:13.208
got attacked while hitting
on a girl at the bar.

1108
01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:17.333
Everyone has a scar from the past.

1109
01:03:18.416 --> 01:03:20.541
In my eyes right now.

1110
01:03:20.625 --> 01:03:22.000
you're beautiful.

1111
01:05:45.916 --> 01:05:46.916
Hey!

1112
01:05:50.541 --> 01:05:51.625
Where are you going?

1113
01:05:55.958 --> 01:05:57.291
What are you doing?

1114
01:06:10.666 --> 01:06:12.083
Listen. bro.

1115
01:06:12.583 --> 01:06:15.125
I was so drunk last night.
so I was… a bit much.

1116
01:06:15.208 --> 01:06:17.750
But I have to admit that…

1117
01:06:17.833 --> 01:06:19.833
I like you just a little bit.

1118
01:06:19.916 --> 01:06:21.958
However. I clearly am aware
of my background…

1119
01:06:22.041 --> 01:06:24.291
No time for jokes.

1120
01:06:24.375 --> 01:06:26.458
So you don't have to take
any responsibility for that.

1121
01:06:26.541 --> 01:06:30.083
Just consider it letting me
be naughty for one night.

1122
01:06:30.166 --> 01:06:31.708
Are you dumping me?

1123
01:06:32.625 --> 01:06:34.208
You can't do this to me.

1124
01:06:34.708 --> 01:06:37.375
Do you know the impact last night is gonna
have on me for the rest of my life?

1125
01:06:37.458 --> 01:06:39.291
-What impact?
-Huge.

1126
01:06:39.375 --> 01:06:41.875
You're my girlfriend now.

1127
01:06:41.958 --> 01:06:43.833
Be responsible for my life. please.

1128
01:06:43.916 --> 01:06:45.583
Don't treat me like a one-night stand.

1129
01:06:45.666 --> 01:06:47.458
We're both adults.

1130
01:06:47.541 --> 01:06:48.791
Be mature.

1131
01:06:48.875 --> 01:06:51.041
-I mean…
-Stop shutting it down.

1132
01:06:51.125 --> 01:06:52.208
Let's have breakfast.

1133
01:06:53.666 --> 01:06:56.041
-What breakfast…
-Breakfast or me?

1134
01:06:56.125 --> 01:06:58.625
Stop saying things like that.

1135
01:07:14.541 --> 01:07:15.750
There. she said hi to us. I heard it.

1136
01:07:15.833 --> 01:07:17.416
-They're dating.
-I knew it.

1137
01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.000
-Are they?
-Of course. they are.

1138
01:07:19.083 --> 01:07:20.666
Trust me.

1139
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.250
Can't you see? They're leaving together.

1140
01:07:28.333 --> 01:07:29.541
See?

1141
01:07:29.625 --> 01:07:32.250
You guys are too damn nosy.

1142
01:07:33.166 --> 01:07:34.333
Mind your own business.

1143
01:07:34.416 --> 01:07:36.708
Just let them be a freaking couple!

1144
01:07:44.875 --> 01:07:47.000
We'll talk again later.

1145
01:07:47.083 --> 01:07:49.791
-He's trying to be her hero.
-What a show-off!

1146
01:07:49.875 --> 01:07:51.666
Good job. buddy.

1147
01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:53.583
You guys look fucking great together!

1148
01:07:55.833 --> 01:07:57.125
How do you feel?

1149
01:07:57.208 --> 01:07:58.125
Not bad.

1150
01:08:00.708 --> 01:08:02.000
Is this enough force for you?

1151
01:08:09.375 --> 01:08:10.375
Go home.

1152
01:08:13.083 --> 01:08:14.208
-Stop that. Sau!
-Hey--

1153
01:08:17.458 --> 01:08:18.708
Everything's sorted. Let's get in.

1154
01:08:18.791 --> 01:08:20.500
No way. get out!

1155
01:08:22.916 --> 01:08:24.875
All clear! Go!

1156
01:08:27.166 --> 01:08:28.875
Morning. Ms. Nga.

1157
01:08:28.958 --> 01:08:31.125
Nga. can you see
Duong just left from Mai's home?

1158
01:08:31.208 --> 01:08:33.833
I'm not blind.
Go downstairs and get my dress!

1159
01:08:33.916 --> 01:08:36.375
-You're so scary!
-No. you're so nosy!

1160
01:08:37.291 --> 01:08:38.625
Someone sent you this keyboard.

1161
01:08:41.166 --> 01:08:43.875
FOR BINH MINH. FROM DUONG.
HAVE FUN…

1162
01:08:54.541 --> 01:08:55.708
Braised fish by Duong!

1163
01:08:55.791 --> 01:08:57.041
Try it!

1164
01:08:58.208 --> 01:09:00.291
-It stinks.
-Here's a shrimp.

1165
01:09:00.833 --> 01:09:02.958
It's good. it's good.
Braised fish naturally stinks.

1166
01:09:04.875 --> 01:09:06.375
-You're cheating.
-You're too good.

1167
01:09:06.458 --> 01:09:08.375
How can anyone beat you. bro?

1168
01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:54.333
IT'S HARD TO MEET IN THIS CROWDED WORLD.
ONCE YOU'VE COME. PLEASE STAY.

1169
01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:01.916
I'm not ready yet.

1170
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.291
Everything is moving so fast.

1171
01:10:04.375 --> 01:10:06.375
It's like you're introducing me.

1172
01:10:06.458 --> 01:10:08.875
Who said she can't see the future
when dating me?

1173
01:10:08.958 --> 01:10:10.833
Now. I'm taking you into the future.

1174
01:10:10.916 --> 01:10:12.041
and you're starting to shut it down again?

1175
01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:15.000
-Are you serious?
-Guess.

1176
01:10:16.375 --> 01:10:18.875
-Really?
-Absolutely.

1177
01:10:19.666 --> 01:10:21.708
Is this your house or a rental?
How can it be that big?

1178
01:10:21.791 --> 01:10:23.666
How can I go in dressed like this?

1179
01:10:24.375 --> 01:10:26.083
Your makeup is a bit all over the place.

1180
01:10:26.166 --> 01:10:28.125
Really?

1181
01:10:28.208 --> 01:10:29.500
I thought so too.

1182
01:10:29.583 --> 01:10:31.875
I paid 20 bucks for this shit.

1183
01:10:31.958 --> 01:10:34.125
I told her to fix it. but she didn't
have time. Now. I have to fix it for sure.

1184
01:10:34.208 --> 01:10:35.333
There's no time. babe.

1185
01:10:35.416 --> 01:10:38.208
Should I take the falsies off then?

1186
01:10:38.291 --> 01:10:40.041
That would make it worse.

1187
01:10:40.750 --> 01:10:43.041
Are you mocking me?

1188
01:10:43.125 --> 01:10:44.125
You're cute.

1189
01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:47.458
That attitude says it's not cute!

1190
01:10:47.541 --> 01:10:49.708
-Tell the truth.
-Trust me.

1191
01:10:49.791 --> 01:10:50.708
Tell me!

1192
01:10:50.791 --> 01:10:52.083
You are cute.

1193
01:10:52.166 --> 01:10:53.791
Now. this bouquet is ugly too.

1194
01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:55.500
-Where did you get it from?
-The makeup lady again--

1195
01:10:55.583 --> 01:10:57.291
Sir. she's mad at you.

1196
01:10:57.375 --> 01:10:58.958
Choose your words carefully.

1197
01:11:01.291 --> 01:11:03.000
Good evening.

1198
01:11:04.916 --> 01:11:06.583
Nah. don't even kiss me.

1199
01:11:06.666 --> 01:11:11.750
How can a son leave for that long
without visiting his parents?

1200
01:11:11.833 --> 01:11:13.666
-No. no. thank you.
-Love you.

1201
01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:15.208
-Who is this?
-Good evening.

1202
01:11:15.291 --> 01:11:16.333
-My girl.
-Oh.

1203
01:11:16.416 --> 01:11:20.875
I brought these flowers for you.
Happy birthday.

1204
01:11:20.958 --> 01:11:22.458
You didn't have to.

1205
01:11:22.541 --> 01:11:23.375
Anyone?

1206
01:11:23.458 --> 01:11:26.041
-Here I am.
-Take these flowers away for me.

1207
01:11:26.125 --> 01:11:28.250
Have a seat.

1208
01:11:28.333 --> 01:11:29.708
These are all my friends.

1209
01:11:29.791 --> 01:11:32.333
-Good evening. everyone.
-Hi.

1210
01:11:33.083 --> 01:11:35.666
-What's your name?
-My name's Mai.

1211
01:11:36.291 --> 01:11:37.875
You're the one and only.

1212
01:11:37.958 --> 01:11:39.083
There's never been another one.

1213
01:11:39.166 --> 01:11:42.708
He has never brought anyone home before.

1214
01:11:43.458 --> 01:11:45.625
What's your job?

1215
01:11:45.708 --> 01:11:48.500
-I am…
-She provides physiotherapy.

1216
01:11:49.541 --> 01:11:50.708
I'm a masseuse.

1217
01:11:51.291 --> 01:11:52.208
What?

1218
01:11:52.291 --> 01:11:54.083
I give massages.

1219
01:11:54.166 --> 01:11:55.416
A masseuse?

1220
01:11:56.208 --> 01:11:57.750
How old are you?

1221
01:11:58.333 --> 01:11:59.458
I'm 37.

1222
01:11:59.541 --> 01:12:00.791
What?

1223
01:12:00.875 --> 01:12:02.041
A masseuse…

1224
01:12:02.125 --> 01:12:06.041
and it's late to not have a family at 37.

1225
01:12:06.125 --> 01:12:07.541
I have a daughter.

1226
01:12:07.625 --> 01:12:09.083
What?

1227
01:12:09.166 --> 01:12:10.708
A masseuse.

1228
01:12:10.791 --> 01:12:12.625
37.

1229
01:12:12.708 --> 01:12:14.208
one child.

1230
01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:16.583
Anything else?

1231
01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:18.291
Let's stop with the questions and eat.

1232
01:12:18.375 --> 01:12:20.375
-Let me talk to her.
-Let's eat.

1233
01:12:20.458 --> 01:12:23.125
Where do you work?

1234
01:12:23.208 --> 01:12:25.208
Ima Koko in District 3.

1235
01:12:26.666 --> 01:12:29.041
-The one I keep wanting to take you to.
-Oh?

1236
01:12:33.125 --> 01:12:34.000
-Really?
-Of course.

1237
01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:35.291
I thought you forgot all about me.

1238
01:12:35.375 --> 01:12:37.500
-How could I?
-Why are you so skinny?

1239
01:12:37.583 --> 01:12:38.625
I've been on a diet.

1240
01:12:39.833 --> 01:12:41.916
-Taking the day off today?
-Yeah.

1241
01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:43.958
Huh?

1242
01:12:44.041 --> 01:12:45.125
You know each other?

1243
01:12:45.208 --> 01:12:47.958
I'm a VIP client.
She has worked on me for a while.

1244
01:12:48.041 --> 01:12:50.125
Huh? You two got the same masseuse?

1245
01:12:50.208 --> 01:12:51.541
-That's great!
-Hey!

1246
01:12:51.625 --> 01:12:53.375
Stop teasing me!

1247
01:12:53.458 --> 01:12:55.916
Why do I never see you there?

1248
01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.333
We're probably in different areas.

1249
01:12:57.416 --> 01:13:01.750
Plus. you probably have tunnel vision
when you go in there.

1250
01:13:01.833 --> 01:13:03.666
Sorry for coming down late.

1251
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:04.916
-Let's cheers!
-Huh?

1252
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000
What day is it today that
no one is congratulating me?

1253
01:13:08.833 --> 01:13:11.250
She's my aunt. Mom's sister.

1254
01:13:11.333 --> 01:13:14.291
She raised me. and her name is Mi.
so I call her MaMi.

1255
01:13:14.375 --> 01:13:15.625
Oh. and--

1256
01:13:15.708 --> 01:13:17.666
I'm Sau's mom.

1257
01:13:21.583 --> 01:13:23.083
Cheers. everyone!

1258
01:13:23.166 --> 01:13:24.000
Sister!

1259
01:13:25.666 --> 01:13:27.958
-Let's get drunk.
-Oh. okay.

1260
01:13:28.041 --> 01:13:31.625
-Drink with me.
-One. two. three. cheers!

1261
01:13:31.708 --> 01:13:34.041
Happy birthday. sis!

1262
01:13:35.416 --> 01:13:38.375
Let's sing! 2.3. go!

1263
01:14:03.666 --> 01:14:05.375
Cheers!

1264
01:14:05.458 --> 01:14:06.958
Come on girl. cheers!

1265
01:15:58.916 --> 01:16:03.375
In the name of the Father.
the Son. and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

1266
01:16:24.416 --> 01:16:25.875
Did you wait for long?

1267
01:16:29.208 --> 01:16:30.416
Gosh.

1268
01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:32.291
I don't know how to treat you now.

1269
01:16:32.958 --> 01:16:35.083
Are you my sister or my son's girl?

1270
01:16:36.875 --> 01:16:38.416
Let's go with sisters.

1271
01:16:41.791 --> 01:16:44.791
You wanted to meet me here because
you don't believe what I'm gonna say?

1272
01:16:44.875 --> 01:16:48.750
No. I'm afraid you won't believe
what I'm gonna say.

1273
01:16:51.708 --> 01:16:55.458
You guys started dating
since you confided in me?

1274
01:16:55.541 --> 01:16:57.250
Does he love you?

1275
01:16:59.458 --> 01:17:01.125
Do you love him?

1276
01:17:01.208 --> 01:17:02.625
Oops!

1277
01:17:02.708 --> 01:17:04.166
So impolite.

1278
01:17:05.666 --> 01:17:08.708
We had the same masseuse for months.

1279
01:17:08.791 --> 01:17:10.666
and neither of us knew.

1280
01:17:19.041 --> 01:17:20.583
Let's talk.

1281
01:17:21.125 --> 01:17:23.791
Don't think I'm meeting you to stop you.

1282
01:17:23.875 --> 01:17:25.125
I'm open.

1283
01:17:25.208 --> 01:17:26.500
Keep falling in love.

1284
01:17:26.583 --> 01:17:27.625
It's love…

1285
01:17:27.708 --> 01:17:29.166
No one can stop it.

1286
01:17:31.208 --> 01:17:32.916
But let's think it over.

1287
01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.375
I'm talking to you as your sister.

1288
01:17:36.458 --> 01:17:38.083
not Duong's mother.

1289
01:17:39.625 --> 01:17:41.250
I'm a single mom.

1290
01:17:41.958 --> 01:17:44.958
I understand everything that
a single mom goes through.

1291
01:17:45.833 --> 01:17:47.791
In front of God here. I'll be honest.

1292
01:17:47.875 --> 01:17:50.083
I always wanted you to have

1293
01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:53.666
a nice. decent. and wealthy man
who could take care of you.

1294
01:17:54.250 --> 01:17:57.250
I just never thought it would be my son.

1295
01:17:57.875 --> 01:17:59.708
Do you know why I call him Sau (worm)?

1296
01:18:00.291 --> 01:18:01.625
Because to me.

1297
01:18:01.708 --> 01:18:04.250
he always lives in his cocoon.

1298
01:18:04.333 --> 01:18:08.583
He's 29 and is still spending
his mommy's money.

1299
01:18:09.416 --> 01:18:11.041
He's a worm at home.

1300
01:18:11.125 --> 01:18:14.333
but outside. he's a free butterfly
with his love life.

1301
01:18:14.416 --> 01:18:17.000
moving from one flower to another.

1302
01:18:18.083 --> 01:18:20.708
You don't think you're suffering enough?

1303
01:18:20.791 --> 01:18:22.500
Your shoulders…

1304
01:18:22.583 --> 01:18:24.125
carrying your father.

1305
01:18:24.208 --> 01:18:25.458
Binh Minh.

1306
01:18:25.541 --> 01:18:26.875
all the clients at work…

1307
01:18:26.958 --> 01:18:30.291
Now. you want to carry
my irresponsible son?

1308
01:18:30.375 --> 01:18:32.375
Are you a weightlifter?

1309
01:18:37.875 --> 01:18:41.541
I've learned through my years
that life is unfair.

1310
01:18:42.125 --> 01:18:44.250
Men can mess up dozens of times.

1311
01:18:44.333 --> 01:18:46.958
They can still restart
their lives at 60. 70 years old.

1312
01:18:47.958 --> 01:18:48.916
As for you.

1313
01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.708
if you mess up again at this age.
that will be the end of it.

1314
01:18:52.791 --> 01:18:56.083
Do you remember the reason
you didn't want to work for me?

1315
01:18:56.166 --> 01:19:00.416
You said friendships suffer
when money is involved.

1316
01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:01.375
Then let me ask you.

1317
01:19:02.958 --> 01:19:04.666
if one day.

1318
01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:08.375
my son breaks your heart.

1319
01:19:09.375 --> 01:19:11.750
how could I ever look at you again?

1320
01:19:12.458 --> 01:19:13.291
‎Huh?

1321
01:19:23.916 --> 01:19:25.166
Do you…

1322
01:19:25.250 --> 01:19:28.291
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1323
01:19:28.375 --> 01:19:30.541
-I mean…
-Sis…

1324
01:19:31.083 --> 01:19:32.583
I got it.

1325
01:19:38.250 --> 01:19:39.750
-Here. let me…
-Hey. hey!

1326
01:19:39.833 --> 01:19:41.625
-Mai!
-Let me return this necklace to you.

1327
01:19:41.708 --> 01:19:43.333
This was my gift for you.

1328
01:19:43.416 --> 01:19:45.500
-No. I'm not taking it back. I'm sad. Mai.
-No. no.

1329
01:19:45.583 --> 01:19:47.875
-Mai!
-Please take it back.

1330
01:19:48.958 --> 01:19:50.708
Just like you said.

1331
01:19:51.458 --> 01:19:53.416
I'm a mother as well.

1332
01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:54.875
I understand.

1333
01:19:55.458 --> 01:19:57.000
Don't worry.

1334
01:19:57.541 --> 01:19:59.708
I know what I have to do.

1335
01:20:01.250 --> 01:20:03.583
Don't say what you "have to" do.

1336
01:20:04.166 --> 01:20:06.083
I hope you can realize

1337
01:20:06.166 --> 01:20:08.458
what you "should" do.

1338
01:20:09.291 --> 01:20:11.958
You're doing this for yourself.
not for me.

1339
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:16.833
I see.

1340
01:20:16.916 --> 01:20:20.500
-Please take this back though.
-Mai!

1341
01:20:20.583 --> 01:20:21.708
It's mine.

1342
01:20:26.083 --> 01:20:27.250
What?

1343
01:20:27.333 --> 01:20:28.750
Hello?

1344
01:20:28.833 --> 01:20:30.750
-You'll scare the customers away.
-Don't worry.

1345
01:20:30.833 --> 01:20:32.833
-What is it?
-Calm down. we'll just talk.

1346
01:20:32.916 --> 01:20:33.958
Mom.

1347
01:20:34.041 --> 01:20:36.541
He's done it again. They're fussing now.

1348
01:20:36.625 --> 01:20:37.833
I'm not fussing.

1349
01:20:38.625 --> 01:20:39.458
Again?

1350
01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:41.833
And this is Mai?

1351
01:20:42.958 --> 01:20:44.166
Is she?

1352
01:20:44.958 --> 01:20:46.000
Let's go outside--

1353
01:20:46.083 --> 01:20:48.416
How much does he owe you?
I'll settle it outside.

1354
01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:50.541
This is my friend's place. Don't do this.

1355
01:20:51.208 --> 01:20:53.458
She asked how much. Answer.

1356
01:20:55.541 --> 01:20:57.041
Don't be so silent.

1357
01:20:58.708 --> 01:21:00.500
-Talk.
-How much?

1358
01:21:00.583 --> 01:21:02.541
-Twenty-one.
-What?

1359
01:21:02.625 --> 01:21:03.708
21.000?

1360
01:21:03.791 --> 01:21:05.625
Well. it's certainly not 20 bucks.

1361
01:21:05.708 --> 01:21:07.250
Are you kidding me?

1362
01:21:09.208 --> 01:21:10.500
What now?

1363
01:21:10.583 --> 01:21:12.208
What a quiet place!

1364
01:21:12.291 --> 01:21:15.416
-Can we please solve this outside?
-Fine.

1365
01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:16.875
Here.

1366
01:21:16.958 --> 01:21:18.333
Take $2.100 as a deposit.

1367
01:21:18.416 --> 01:21:20.375
Call me and I'll settle the rest.

1368
01:21:21.166 --> 01:21:23.000
Why didn't you tell me you have a sponsor?

1369
01:21:23.083 --> 01:21:24.416
Boss!

1370
01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:26.500
-Please help me settle this.
-I'm not new to this.

1371
01:21:26.583 --> 01:21:27.833
-Leave.
-Got it.

1372
01:21:27.916 --> 01:21:29.125
Nice coffee!

1373
01:21:29.833 --> 01:21:30.875
Make way for me.

1374
01:21:30.958 --> 01:21:33.750
I thought you were the shit.
Turns out your boss is much better.

1375
01:21:33.833 --> 01:21:35.958
Stop running away from me.

1376
01:21:36.041 --> 01:21:37.250
What?

1377
01:21:37.333 --> 01:21:38.875
Why are you so late?

1378
01:21:42.333 --> 01:21:45.083
I'll take care of your father's situation.

1379
01:21:45.625 --> 01:21:47.625
Go home.

1380
01:21:47.708 --> 01:21:50.333
How can you fall in love
with such a troublesome family?

1381
01:21:51.083 --> 01:21:52.625
No. no. this money…

1382
01:21:53.583 --> 01:21:55.041
I'll pay you back.

1383
01:21:56.333 --> 01:21:59.000
Dad. let's go home and talk this out.

1384
01:21:59.083 --> 01:22:02.458
Minh. help me clean this up.

1385
01:22:02.541 --> 01:22:04.208
Dad! Let's go.

1386
01:22:07.708 --> 01:22:08.708
-Mai.
-Thank you.

1387
01:22:08.791 --> 01:22:10.250
Clean this up for me.

1388
01:22:10.333 --> 01:22:11.833
I'm sorry.

1389
01:22:11.916 --> 01:22:13.333
Two taels of gold

1390
01:22:13.416 --> 01:22:15.166
and $10.000.

1391
01:22:16.166 --> 01:22:17.583
that's all that I have.

1392
01:22:17.666 --> 01:22:19.041
Take them all.

1393
01:22:20.583 --> 01:22:22.083
-Listen to…
-Take them.

1394
01:22:22.166 --> 01:22:23.875
Take them all and keep on gambling.

1395
01:22:23.958 --> 01:22:25.333
It's not that. Listen to me.

1396
01:22:25.416 --> 01:22:27.666
Don't ever come back into my life again.

1397
01:22:32.666 --> 01:22:33.958
That was harsh.

1398
01:22:34.041 --> 01:22:35.791
And all the things you've done
to my life are not?

1399
01:22:35.875 --> 01:22:38.666
You don't use your head to think.

1400
01:22:39.166 --> 01:22:41.208
How can you be this cruel to me?

1401
01:22:41.291 --> 01:22:45.708
I thought every time I paid your debt.
you'd stop out of love for me.

1402
01:22:45.791 --> 01:22:47.500
But there's no limit to you.

1403
01:22:48.625 --> 01:22:50.916
I just really want to help you.

1404
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.250
Take this.

1405
01:22:52.333 --> 01:22:53.541
-Take all of this.
-Listen…

1406
01:22:53.625 --> 01:22:58.583
I'm begging you. leave me alone.
I can't take this anymore.

1407
01:22:59.125 --> 01:23:01.416
I cannot take this anymore.

1408
01:23:07.958 --> 01:23:09.291
Mai.

1409
01:23:09.375 --> 01:23:10.875
Why are you crying?

1410
01:23:10.958 --> 01:23:12.791
What's happening?

1411
01:23:12.875 --> 01:23:14.500
You've been avoiding me
ever since we met Mom.

1412
01:23:14.583 --> 01:23:17.625
-Go home. I'm in the midd--
-How can I go home?

1413
01:23:17.708 --> 01:23:19.625
You didn't pick up my calls.

1414
01:23:19.708 --> 01:23:21.000
I'm your boyfriend.

1415
01:23:21.083 --> 01:23:23.500
I have the right to know
what's going on with you.

1416
01:23:25.041 --> 01:23:27.500
-What was that at the shop?
-Done with the questions?

1417
01:23:27.583 --> 01:23:29.083
I want to know what Mom said to you.

1418
01:23:29.166 --> 01:23:31.666
I said I don't want to talk right now.
Just leave.

1419
01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:33.583
At least let me know what you want.

1420
01:23:36.625 --> 01:23:37.666
I want to break up.

1421
01:23:39.333 --> 01:23:40.916
What are you talking about?

1422
01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:49.500
Talk to me.

1423
01:23:49.583 --> 01:23:52.833
Tell me. Tell me what's wrong.
so I can find a solution.

1424
01:23:52.916 --> 01:23:54.208
Don't shut me out.

1425
01:23:56.375 --> 01:23:58.125
Okay. Come here.

1426
01:24:00.375 --> 01:24:02.458
Here. My father.

1427
01:24:02.541 --> 01:24:04.083
A man who loves money.

1428
01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.208
He owes the gangster
more than $20.000 in gambling debts.

1429
01:24:07.291 --> 01:24:09.333
-Mai.
-Take care of that.

1430
01:24:09.416 --> 01:24:10.708
And my daughter.

1431
01:24:10.791 --> 01:24:12.250
who dropped out of school months ago.

1432
01:24:12.333 --> 01:24:15.833
trying to make a living where your mom
is paying her. solve that too.

1433
01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:18.500
And then there's me. this old hag.

1434
01:24:18.583 --> 01:24:21.958
I have to work as a masseuse
to make a living every day.

1435
01:24:22.041 --> 01:24:24.208
Take care of that for me too.

1436
01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:26.583
And so?

1437
01:24:27.333 --> 01:24:29.000
You wanted to know.

1438
01:24:29.083 --> 01:24:30.958
Well. there you go.

1439
01:24:31.708 --> 01:24:34.708
You knew fuck all about me.

1440
01:24:34.791 --> 01:24:36.208
Enough. Mai.

1441
01:24:38.166 --> 01:24:39.500
That's enough.

1442
01:24:40.250 --> 01:24:41.875
What? Not used to this?

1443
01:24:43.291 --> 01:24:44.916
It's me.

1444
01:24:45.791 --> 01:24:50.208
I should've told you. showed you
my true self from the start.

1445
01:24:50.291 --> 01:24:52.041
Because I'm uneducated.

1446
01:24:52.125 --> 01:24:54.208
There was no one to teach me.

1447
01:25:01.833 --> 01:25:03.291
Your mom was right.

1448
01:25:04.583 --> 01:25:07.083
You can't do anything without money.

1449
01:25:10.958 --> 01:25:12.375
You said you will take care of me.

1450
01:25:13.125 --> 01:25:15.000
so how?

1451
01:25:15.083 --> 01:25:17.458
How can you when I make
more money than you?

1452
01:25:33.208 --> 01:25:34.250
What did you say to Mai?

1453
01:25:35.666 --> 01:25:36.833
Who are you raising your voice at?

1454
01:25:37.958 --> 01:25:39.125
I'm sorry.

1455
01:25:39.208 --> 01:25:40.791
But I want to know what you said to her!

1456
01:25:40.875 --> 01:25:42.791
I said what I needed to say.

1457
01:25:45.541 --> 01:25:46.791
I know you look down on her.

1458
01:25:46.875 --> 01:25:48.666
-I don't.
-It's okay.

1459
01:25:48.750 --> 01:25:50.166
But I want to know that.
deep down in your heart.

1460
01:25:50.250 --> 01:25:51.958
you know she's a good person. right?

1461
01:25:52.041 --> 01:25:53.375
I don't deny that.

1462
01:25:53.458 --> 01:25:54.958
She is a very good person

1463
01:25:55.041 --> 01:25:57.250
for any man but you.

1464
01:26:02.375 --> 01:26:03.791
What are you gonna do for her?

1465
01:26:04.375 --> 01:26:06.000
Have you seen her family?

1466
01:26:06.083 --> 01:26:07.541
Her dad's neck-deep in debt.

1467
01:26:07.625 --> 01:26:09.375
Her daughter's barely educated

1468
01:26:09.458 --> 01:26:10.416
and has an undefined gender.

1469
01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:13.000
-Don't say that.
-I mean it.

1470
01:26:14.375 --> 01:26:17.000
Are you trying to be
the knight in shining armor?

1471
01:26:17.083 --> 01:26:18.166
Have a look at yourself!

1472
01:26:18.250 --> 01:26:19.833
Do you have a job?

1473
01:26:19.916 --> 01:26:22.125
Name your career.

1474
01:26:22.208 --> 01:26:23.958
A composer?

1475
01:26:24.041 --> 01:26:25.750
A street performer?

1476
01:26:25.833 --> 01:26:27.500
You refused to live in a house like this

1477
01:26:27.583 --> 01:26:29.583
to live in an apartment
for "life experience."

1478
01:26:29.666 --> 01:26:31.250
Have you composed any song?

1479
01:26:31.333 --> 01:26:33.791
Have you ever contributed financially?

1480
01:26:33.875 --> 01:26:38.083
You can only play the piano.
and in my own restaurant. might I add.

1481
01:26:38.166 --> 01:26:40.958
Not a cent to your name
and you want to be Hercules?

1482
01:26:44.916 --> 01:26:46.500
All of this is about money?

1483
01:26:46.583 --> 01:26:48.375
Maybe money is not important to you.

1484
01:26:48.458 --> 01:26:50.041
But without money.

1485
01:26:50.125 --> 01:26:52.000
you can't do any damn thing.

1486
01:26:54.041 --> 01:26:55.333
To be more specific.

1487
01:26:55.416 --> 01:26:56.708
without my money.

1488
01:26:56.791 --> 01:26:58.208
you can't do shit.

1489
01:26:58.791 --> 01:27:01.166
I've done all of this for you.

1490
01:27:01.250 --> 01:27:03.708
No. you did this for you.

1491
01:27:18.333 --> 01:27:20.375
If I did it for me.

1492
01:27:20.458 --> 01:27:21.958
I would've gotten married long ago.

1493
01:27:22.041 --> 01:27:24.666
and I'd only care about my own happiness.

1494
01:27:26.666 --> 01:27:30.000
I've spent all these years alone.
and for whom?

1495
01:27:31.083 --> 01:27:33.250
I've driven so many people away

1496
01:27:33.333 --> 01:27:36.416
out of fear that they wouldn't love
my son. and for whom?

1497
01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:39.791
I sacrificed my youth
and worked like a slave.

1498
01:27:39.875 --> 01:27:42.125
so my son could live like a prince.
and for whom?

1499
01:27:42.208 --> 01:27:44.083
Give me back my youth.

1500
01:27:51.708 --> 01:27:52.916
I wish you could.

1501
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.833
How? It's too late!

1502
01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:58.958
I've never asked you
to give me your youth.

1503
01:27:59.541 --> 01:28:01.708
I always wanted you to have
a special someone.

1504
01:28:01.791 --> 01:28:04.000
-I've always wanted you to live your…
-You just don't understand.

1505
01:28:04.875 --> 01:28:07.625
I never wanted you to live alone.

1506
01:28:07.708 --> 01:28:10.375
to suffer everything then turn around
and say that it was all for me.

1507
01:28:31.458 --> 01:28:32.583
Oh my God.

1508
01:28:43.958 --> 01:28:46.083
You'll always be a worm.

1509
01:28:46.875 --> 01:28:48.500
Always.

1510
01:28:59.541 --> 01:29:01.333
Do you know why I don't want
to work for you

1511
01:29:01.416 --> 01:29:02.750
and move out?

1512
01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:06.333
Because in the end. a worm

1513
01:29:07.666 --> 01:29:09.416
will turn into a butterfly.

1514
01:29:13.916 --> 01:29:17.208
Leave all your bank cards.
then go be a butterfly as you want.

1515
01:30:08.291 --> 01:30:09.750
This is your last week's pay.

1516
01:30:09.833 --> 01:30:11.000
What?

1517
01:30:13.333 --> 01:30:14.583
She called me.

1518
01:30:16.583 --> 01:30:18.000
Take this.

1519
01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:23.000
Hey!

1520
01:30:23.083 --> 01:30:25.083
I know you're upset. but you gotta know

1521
01:30:25.166 --> 01:30:27.291
you're my friend. she's my boss.

1522
01:30:27.875 --> 01:30:30.208
-If I don't fire you. she'll fire me.
-I know.

1523
01:30:30.291 --> 01:30:31.833
-Duong!
-It's okay.

1524
01:30:31.916 --> 01:30:33.875
You don't seem to understand me. bro.

1525
01:30:33.958 --> 01:30:35.250
Duong!

1526
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.708
JOB APPLICATION

1527
01:30:40.791 --> 01:30:42.583
You've gotta move next month.

1528
01:30:43.666 --> 01:30:44.750
I paid in full.

1529
01:30:44.833 --> 01:30:47.041
Yeah. you paid.

1530
01:30:47.125 --> 01:30:49.000
But someone else paid fuller.

1531
01:30:49.083 --> 01:30:51.208
This unit is paid for for a whole year.

1532
01:31:00.375 --> 01:31:01.458
Where are you?

1533
01:31:03.083 --> 01:31:04.916
-Goddammit.
-No.

1534
01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.958
Slow down.

1535
01:31:07.666 --> 01:31:08.708
Relax your hand!

1536
01:31:10.083 --> 01:31:12.500
-Mom. it hurts!
-Come here. baby!

1537
01:31:18.666 --> 01:31:20.750
You'd better do something.

1538
01:31:20.833 --> 01:31:23.458
Are you just gonna leave him like that?

1539
01:31:23.541 --> 01:31:25.500
Let him be. He chose this.

1540
01:31:25.583 --> 01:31:27.208
I'll just think he's a nobody.

1541
01:31:27.291 --> 01:31:28.958
-How can you say that?
-Who's next?

1542
01:31:29.041 --> 01:31:30.583
I'm in no mood. I quit.

1543
01:31:30.666 --> 01:31:32.708
The family is in distress.

1544
01:31:33.208 --> 01:31:35.041
Tham. take me outside.

1545
01:31:35.791 --> 01:31:38.208
I'll take my leave.

1546
01:31:59.750 --> 01:32:00.916
Get some sleep!

1547
01:32:01.708 --> 01:32:03.250
Stop texting her.

1548
01:32:03.333 --> 01:32:05.333
You're in too deep.

1549
01:32:08.083 --> 01:32:10.333
How can you sleep
after drinking coffee at this hour?

1550
01:32:10.416 --> 01:32:12.375
Drink some ginger tea.

1551
01:32:13.541 --> 01:32:14.875
Give me your leg.

1552
01:32:14.958 --> 01:32:17.000
-Stop…
-Come on.

1553
01:32:17.583 --> 01:32:19.500
Let me give a masseuse a massage.

1554
01:32:22.458 --> 01:32:24.291
I'll move in here tomorrow.

1555
01:32:24.375 --> 01:32:26.708
Just let Grandpa be. He won't change.

1556
01:32:26.791 --> 01:32:28.375
Don't be sad.

1557
01:32:44.833 --> 01:32:46.250
Sorry. sorry.

1558
01:32:47.083 --> 01:32:48.416
See the accountant
to get your last paycheck.

1559
01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:50.541
What's wrong? is my playing not good?

1560
01:32:50.625 --> 01:32:53.000
You're so good
that my customers can't eat.

1561
01:32:53.083 --> 01:32:56.333
My restaurant needs some relaxing music.

1562
01:32:56.416 --> 01:32:58.208
not a masterpiece meant for an orchestra.

1563
01:32:58.291 --> 01:32:59.916
People need to eat!

1564
01:33:00.666 --> 01:33:02.416
Now. you're copping an attitude?

1565
01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:06.041
It was hard for anyone to maintain
a business after Covid.

1566
01:33:06.125 --> 01:33:08.000
Give me a chance to do it longer.

1567
01:33:08.583 --> 01:33:09.791
Come in.

1568
01:33:10.833 --> 01:33:13.125
You don't have to pay me today. Thanks.

1569
01:33:13.208 --> 01:33:15.041
Such a big ego!

1570
01:33:17.708 --> 01:33:19.000
Come in.

1571
01:33:19.083 --> 01:33:20.625
Hurry up. I have things to do.

1572
01:33:20.708 --> 01:33:22.208
Remember. soft and tenderly.

1573
01:33:22.291 --> 01:33:23.833
People need to eat.

1574
01:33:23.916 --> 01:33:25.958
-Don't play any masterpiece. okay?
-Okay.

1575
01:33:32.083 --> 01:33:33.291
Duong!

1576
01:33:38.708 --> 01:33:40.833
Don't think too much
about what my mom said.

1577
01:33:42.041 --> 01:33:45.000
She wanted to be mean.
so you'd break up with her.

1578
01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:48.458
I've been her daughter and her husband
long enough to know this.

1579
01:33:49.333 --> 01:33:51.375
She just looks tough on the outside.

1580
01:33:51.458 --> 01:33:53.333
while what she really yearns for is love.

1581
01:33:54.708 --> 01:33:57.083
I haven't seen her smile for a long time.

1582
01:33:58.541 --> 01:34:00.541
The last time she was happy

1583
01:34:02.083 --> 01:34:03.541
was when you were around.

1584
01:34:07.166 --> 01:34:08.291
Be patient!

1585
01:34:09.458 --> 01:34:10.500
Don't give up.

1586
01:34:11.666 --> 01:34:13.500
Be her boyfriend.

1587
01:34:15.208 --> 01:34:16.375
Back to work now.

1588
01:34:19.958 --> 01:34:21.000
Minh!

1589
01:34:23.666 --> 01:34:25.041
Do your best!

1590
01:34:29.875 --> 01:34:30.708
Mai!

1591
01:34:31.458 --> 01:34:33.041
Why do you keep seducing my husband?

1592
01:34:33.125 --> 01:34:35.625
There are so many men here.
and you just had to pick my husband?

1593
01:34:35.708 --> 01:34:37.750
Tell me what you want. you damn whore!

1594
01:34:37.833 --> 01:34:40.041
Have you had a look at your husband
before asking?

1595
01:34:40.125 --> 01:34:41.833
How dare you!
I'll slap the shit out of you!

1596
01:34:41.916 --> 01:34:43.000
-I'm talking to you. bitch.
-Come on. stop!

1597
01:34:43.083 --> 01:34:46.625
-Stop. don't fight here.
-Why are you walking away from me?

1598
01:34:46.708 --> 01:34:49.250
Go be a hooker somewhere else.

1599
01:34:49.333 --> 01:34:52.666
Ever since you rented the place to her.
the whole place has been in chaos.

1600
01:34:52.750 --> 01:34:53.875
Come on. shut up!

1601
01:34:53.958 --> 01:34:56.500
It sounds like I have to kick her out.
Is that what you're saying?

1602
01:34:56.583 --> 01:34:58.958
If it was me. I'd slap them for sure.

1603
01:34:59.041 --> 01:35:00.375
-I wouldn't let it slide.
-Stop!

1604
01:35:00.458 --> 01:35:01.916
You've gotta live your life. babe.

1605
01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.291
The whole building said I'm a hooker.

1606
01:35:04.375 --> 01:35:07.291
but I'm not. even though
I absolutely look like one.

1607
01:35:09.208 --> 01:35:11.416
Being a woman is already a misfortune.

1608
01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:13.583
Try and live this life happily.

1609
01:35:13.666 --> 01:35:15.875
You never know
what you'll be in the next life.

1610
01:35:30.166 --> 01:35:32.500
I'M GETTING PAID TODAY.
I'M TRYING MY BEST.

1611
01:35:32.583 --> 01:35:36.000
I WON'T LET YOU DOWN.
GIVE ME MORE TIME. MISS YOU.

1612
01:35:38.708 --> 01:35:39.833
Mai!

1613
01:35:42.166 --> 01:35:44.208
Fuck you. You snitched.
so Tu would fire me?

1614
01:35:44.291 --> 01:35:45.875
I don't know what you're saying. I didn't.

1615
01:35:45.958 --> 01:35:47.375
It must have been her.

1616
01:35:47.458 --> 01:35:49.500
-What's wrong. Trinh?
-Shut up. Fuck off!

1617
01:35:50.416 --> 01:35:52.208
Who else could it be?

1618
01:35:52.291 --> 01:35:54.083
I don't want to talk to you in this state.

1619
01:35:54.166 --> 01:35:55.458
‎Damn you!

1620
01:35:55.541 --> 01:35:57.291
How dare you deny it?

1621
01:35:57.375 --> 01:35:58.833
You're pretending you didn't do it?

1622
01:35:58.916 --> 01:36:01.875
I told you I wanted to beat you up
from the start.

1623
01:36:01.958 --> 01:36:04.083
I haven't even touched you.
and you messed with me.

1624
01:36:04.166 --> 01:36:07.708
Well. you messed with the wrong person.

1625
01:36:11.875 --> 01:36:13.583
How much do they have to pay
for you to open your mouth?

1626
01:36:13.666 --> 01:36:15.875
-I know what you do. How much?
-She's a whore for sure.

1627
01:36:15.958 --> 01:36:18.000
-She's a sugar baby for sure.
-Just look at her sleek eyebrows.

1628
01:36:18.083 --> 01:36:21.833
Can you pretend to be a little worse.
so the rest of us can make a living?

1629
01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:56.958
You're only prettier than me.

1630
01:36:57.041 --> 01:36:58.208
Do you have a boyfriend?

1631
01:36:58.291 --> 01:36:59.125
How dare you seduce my husband!

1632
01:36:59.208 --> 01:37:01.041
-I like you.
-Such a whore!

1633
01:37:01.125 --> 01:37:02.708
How much do they have to pay
for you to open your mouth?

1634
01:37:10.833 --> 01:37:12.000
Fight.

1635
01:37:21.958 --> 01:37:23.208
I said I didn't do it.

1636
01:37:23.291 --> 01:37:26.208
Why do you keep fighting me?

1637
01:37:26.291 --> 01:37:28.250
How dare you hit her!

1638
01:37:31.083 --> 01:37:32.833
I've let you live for too long.

1639
01:37:34.958 --> 01:37:36.375
Tu!

1640
01:37:36.458 --> 01:37:37.791
Tu!

1641
01:37:39.375 --> 01:37:40.958
Mai! What the heck?

1642
01:37:52.041 --> 01:37:53.583
Mai! Mai!

1643
01:37:53.666 --> 01:37:55.291
Mai! Stop!

1644
01:38:10.250 --> 01:38:11.625
I said

1645
01:38:11.708 --> 01:38:13.416
I didn't do it.

1646
01:38:23.208 --> 01:38:25.500
Why do I have to hurt you?
Who do you think you are?

1647
01:38:25.583 --> 01:38:28.000
It's you. You're the one hurting me.
you hear me?

1648
01:38:28.083 --> 01:38:30.041
-Mai!
-You hear me?

1649
01:38:30.125 --> 01:38:33.208
Why didn't you guys stop them?
What happened to her?

1650
01:38:33.291 --> 01:38:34.541
Mai!

1651
01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:36.541
Mai!

1652
01:38:37.708 --> 01:38:39.375
This is a business.
not a place where you can fight.

1653
01:38:39.458 --> 01:38:41.208
-She's gone insane.
-Shut up.

1654
01:38:41.291 --> 01:38:43.000
-She started--
-Shut it.

1655
01:38:43.083 --> 01:38:45.375
Explain it in the management office.

1656
01:38:45.458 --> 01:38:47.083
I'm sorry.

1657
01:38:47.166 --> 01:38:48.250
It's all okay.

1658
01:38:48.333 --> 01:38:50.708
It's just a misunderstanding!
Please go ahead!

1659
01:38:50.791 --> 01:38:52.041
Tu!

1660
01:38:53.208 --> 01:38:54.416
I quit.

1661
01:38:55.666 --> 01:38:57.250
-Mai!
-Mai!

1662
01:38:57.333 --> 01:38:58.833
It's okay everyone.

1663
01:38:58.916 --> 01:39:00.208
Please continue.

1664
01:39:00.916 --> 01:39:02.625
Someone. stop Mai!

1665
01:39:02.708 --> 01:39:03.875
Mai!

1666
01:39:03.958 --> 01:39:05.291
Mai!

1667
01:39:11.208 --> 01:39:12.750
Did you get in a fight?

1668
01:39:17.666 --> 01:39:18.958
Are you okay?

1669
01:39:24.375 --> 01:39:26.000
What did you

1670
01:39:26.083 --> 01:39:27.541
call me here for?

1671
01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:32.875
If you don't want to talk.

1672
01:39:32.958 --> 01:39:34.625
then let me do the talking first.

1673
01:39:41.041 --> 01:39:42.166
A gift.

1674
01:39:43.666 --> 01:39:44.791
Why?

1675
01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:46.750
Because I want to.

1676
01:39:47.708 --> 01:39:50.625
I bought this with my own money.

1677
01:39:50.708 --> 01:39:52.500
not my mom's.

1678
01:39:53.666 --> 01:39:54.958
Can I put it on for you?

1679
01:40:01.375 --> 01:40:02.250
So pretty.

1680
01:40:06.041 --> 01:40:07.500
This is for savings.

1681
01:40:07.583 --> 01:40:08.791
It's only an ounce.

1682
01:40:08.875 --> 01:40:10.291
It's not much.

1683
01:40:10.375 --> 01:40:12.166
When I make more money.

1684
01:40:12.250 --> 01:40:14.041
I'll give you a tael.

1685
01:40:16.208 --> 01:40:17.833
Give me some time.

1686
01:40:20.916 --> 01:40:22.833
So because of these things…

1687
01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:26.750
you became like that?

1688
01:40:38.416 --> 01:40:40.416
You were so happy.

1689
01:40:42.291 --> 01:40:45.250
Why do you have to suffer
for a girl like me?

1690
01:40:46.416 --> 01:40:48.041
You're stupid. Sau.

1691
01:40:49.666 --> 01:40:51.458
No one is wise when in love.

1692
01:40:59.458 --> 01:41:00.708
Go.

1693
01:41:06.375 --> 01:41:07.666
I'll head out.

1694
01:41:09.125 --> 01:41:10.500
Sau!

1695
01:41:10.583 --> 01:41:12.500
I don't think you're that stupid.

1696
01:41:13.166 --> 01:41:15.000
I meant let's go.

1697
01:41:15.083 --> 01:41:16.083
Where?

1698
01:41:16.166 --> 01:41:17.750
Anywhere.

1699
01:41:17.833 --> 01:41:20.125
To a place where no one knows us.

1700
01:41:20.208 --> 01:41:23.375
It doesn't matter
if we're poor and life is hard.

1701
01:41:23.958 --> 01:41:26.166
I just want to be in love.

1702
01:41:26.250 --> 01:41:28.958
I'm almost 40.

1703
01:41:35.083 --> 01:41:36.250
Le Trung Duong!

1704
01:41:37.625 --> 01:41:38.958
Do you love me?

1705
01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.625
Do I need to answer that?

1706
01:41:41.708 --> 01:41:43.083
Then promise me.

1707
01:41:44.166 --> 01:41:46.125
Don't ever leave me!

1708
01:41:47.083 --> 01:41:48.500
I'll try my best!

1709
01:41:54.333 --> 01:41:56.375
You scared me!

1710
01:41:56.458 --> 01:41:58.375
So what? Hate me!

1711
01:41:59.291 --> 01:42:00.541
Where's the ring?

1712
01:42:02.458 --> 01:42:04.208
I'll take this. Take me out.

1713
01:42:04.291 --> 01:42:05.875
As you wish!

1714
01:42:12.333 --> 01:42:13.875
It wasn't me.

1715
01:42:13.958 --> 01:42:14.958
It was you.

1716
01:42:15.041 --> 01:42:16.833
It was definitely you.

1717
01:42:17.500 --> 01:42:19.125
Just admit it.

1718
01:42:19.208 --> 01:42:21.625
Just say what you think
and how you feel out loud.

1719
01:42:21.708 --> 01:42:23.000
Be brave!

1720
01:42:23.833 --> 01:42:25.000
Isn't that too mean. bitch?

1721
01:42:25.083 --> 01:42:26.458
How can I ever be as mean as you?

1722
01:42:26.541 --> 01:42:29.791
Everyone is evil in your eyes
when you're the true devil yourself.

1723
01:42:29.875 --> 01:42:33.541
You let your dog poop in front of people's
houses but get annoyed by everything.

1724
01:42:33.625 --> 01:42:35.166
How dare you talk to me like that!

1725
01:42:35.250 --> 01:42:37.500
-Do you want me to slap you?
-Do it.

1726
01:42:37.583 --> 01:42:38.625
Do it!

1727
01:42:44.041 --> 01:42:46.583
-She's so freaking mean.
-Enough!

1728
01:42:46.666 --> 01:42:48.416
Boy. are you moving back in?

1729
01:42:48.500 --> 01:42:50.916
No one is renting from you.
I'll move out next month.

1730
01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.625
Don't pretend to be a nice person.

1731
01:42:52.708 --> 01:42:54.291
What the heck?

1732
01:42:54.375 --> 01:42:55.375
What did I do?

1733
01:42:55.458 --> 01:42:57.750
What's with all the noise?

1734
01:42:57.833 --> 01:42:59.458
Why are you taking up all the space?

1735
01:42:59.541 --> 01:43:02.000
-Move.
-No. you move! Out of my life!

1736
01:43:02.083 --> 01:43:03.625
Pervert!

1737
01:43:03.708 --> 01:43:05.500
How dare you yell at me!

1738
01:43:07.125 --> 01:43:08.583
You wanna fight again?

1739
01:43:08.666 --> 01:43:09.875
Why did you yell at my husband?

1740
01:43:09.958 --> 01:43:12.750
You're no better than him.
Take a look at yourself.

1741
01:43:12.833 --> 01:43:14.000
Stop it.

1742
01:43:14.083 --> 01:43:15.583
No one wants your husband.

1743
01:43:15.666 --> 01:43:17.750
Why do you have to protect such a man?

1744
01:43:17.833 --> 01:43:20.625
Spend that time
on making yourself beautiful instead!

1745
01:43:24.458 --> 01:43:27.125
Fantastic speech. girl!

1746
01:43:27.208 --> 01:43:28.750
Kill them with your words!

1747
01:43:29.708 --> 01:43:31.416
Just be happy!

1748
01:43:55.833 --> 01:43:57.250
Mai Thi Ngoc Mai.

1749
01:43:57.333 --> 01:43:59.041
I love you!

1750
01:43:59.958 --> 01:44:01.583
Le Trung Duong.

1751
01:44:01.666 --> 01:44:03.583
allowed!

1752
01:44:22.291 --> 01:44:23.625
-Sau…
-Yes?

1753
01:44:23.708 --> 01:44:25.458
I wonder what your mom called us here for.

1754
01:44:26.791 --> 01:44:28.500
Whatever she says.

1755
01:44:28.583 --> 01:44:30.666
we've already made our own decisions.

1756
01:44:30.750 --> 01:44:31.833
Right?

1757
01:44:32.458 --> 01:44:33.625
You've got me.

1758
01:44:39.916 --> 01:44:41.333
How's the food?

1759
01:44:47.166 --> 01:44:48.250
There you are.

1760
01:44:48.333 --> 01:44:50.041
Come on in.

1761
01:44:50.125 --> 01:44:51.041
Have a seat.

1762
01:44:54.750 --> 01:44:57.375
-Why are you here?
-Wait and you'll see.

1763
01:44:57.958 --> 01:44:58.875
Tham.

1764
01:44:58.958 --> 01:45:00.166
-Yes. ma'am?
-Serve the food.

1765
01:45:00.250 --> 01:45:01.750
Yes. ma'am.

1766
01:45:02.291 --> 01:45:04.250
Wow. a family meeting?

1767
01:45:04.333 --> 01:45:05.500
How have you been recently?

1768
01:45:05.583 --> 01:45:06.958
Good.

1769
01:45:07.041 --> 01:45:07.875
It's steak.

1770
01:45:07.958 --> 01:45:10.000
your favorite food. Eat up.

1771
01:45:11.791 --> 01:45:13.458
Have some food. Mom.

1772
01:45:13.541 --> 01:45:15.416
You probably didn't call me home

1773
01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:18.000
just for the steak. right?

1774
01:45:19.583 --> 01:45:22.416
Can't I just invite you guys home
for dinner?

1775
01:45:22.500 --> 01:45:23.875
So many questions.

1776
01:45:30.708 --> 01:45:33.833
We were so close.
I was having so much fun.

1777
01:45:34.416 --> 01:45:35.916
then this happened.

1778
01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:36.958
We can't even look at each other.

1779
01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.500
This is nonsense.

1780
01:45:42.166 --> 01:45:43.375
It's all my fault.

1781
01:45:43.458 --> 01:45:45.125
I've given you so much hope.

1782
01:45:45.208 --> 01:45:47.375
and I was the one to take it all away.

1783
01:45:48.416 --> 01:45:49.791
It seems like

1784
01:45:49.875 --> 01:45:51.416
I'm so selfish.

1785
01:45:52.625 --> 01:45:55.750
That's why I want
to give something back to you.

1786
01:45:56.458 --> 01:45:58.416
Binh Minh loves to study abroad.

1787
01:46:00.833 --> 01:46:02.083
Four years in Switzerland.

1788
01:46:02.166 --> 01:46:04.333
That's all I can do.

1789
01:46:04.416 --> 01:46:06.458
Take it to ease my mind.

1790
01:46:07.166 --> 01:46:08.333
Okay?

1791
01:46:13.083 --> 01:46:15.833
You blew my mind.

1792
01:46:15.916 --> 01:46:17.166
You should've said it from the beginning.

1793
01:46:18.041 --> 01:46:19.208
You know I love you. Mom?

1794
01:46:19.291 --> 01:46:20.625
You want this?

1795
01:46:20.708 --> 01:46:23.125
I love Mai too. If you separate us…

1796
01:46:23.208 --> 01:46:24.833
-She asked me earlier.
-I don't know what to do.

1797
01:46:24.916 --> 01:46:27.583
I love you so much. I know you know.

1798
01:46:27.666 --> 01:46:29.500
I do too.

1799
01:46:30.208 --> 01:46:31.583
I…

1800
01:46:31.666 --> 01:46:33.708
Thank you for being so thoughtful.

1801
01:46:35.541 --> 01:46:37.208
Thank you for loving me…

1802
01:46:41.208 --> 01:46:42.708
and for loving my daughter.

1803
01:46:45.166 --> 01:46:47.416
I know you love your child.

1804
01:46:49.583 --> 01:46:51.333
I do too.

1805
01:46:55.791 --> 01:46:58.458
So may I take care of your child's future…

1806
01:47:00.416 --> 01:47:02.791
in exchange for my child's future?

1807
01:47:04.875 --> 01:47:06.041
Is that okay?

1808
01:47:11.875 --> 01:47:13.833
Please break up.

1809
01:47:13.916 --> 01:47:15.000
Okay?

1810
01:47:15.833 --> 01:47:17.166
You tricked me?

1811
01:47:17.250 --> 01:47:18.625
You didn't say that earlier.

1812
01:47:20.041 --> 01:47:21.291
I'm sorry. Mom.

1813
01:47:23.541 --> 01:47:24.875
Let's go home.

1814
01:47:24.958 --> 01:47:26.333
Let's go. Mom.

1815
01:47:26.416 --> 01:47:27.541
Stop right there.

1816
01:47:27.625 --> 01:47:29.541
You can't leave like that.

1817
01:47:30.750 --> 01:47:32.750
Dao. say something.

1818
01:47:32.833 --> 01:47:34.958
We planned this.

1819
01:47:35.041 --> 01:47:36.541
I thought when you called me home.

1820
01:47:36.625 --> 01:47:39.041
you'd say something more reasonable.

1821
01:47:39.125 --> 01:47:41.500
If you called me home to break us up.

1822
01:47:41.583 --> 01:47:43.416
I've already told you the answer is no.

1823
01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:45.791
It will still be a "no." no matter what.

1824
01:47:45.875 --> 01:47:47.916
I tried my best to be nice to you.

1825
01:47:49.291 --> 01:47:51.833
Don't force me
to show all the ugly things.

1826
01:47:51.916 --> 01:47:53.750
-Go ahead.
-Do you know who Binh Minh's dad is?

1827
01:47:55.458 --> 01:47:56.666
You went too far.

1828
01:47:57.250 --> 01:47:58.375
Sau!

1829
01:48:00.500 --> 01:48:02.416
You think you know her that well?

1830
01:48:05.250 --> 01:48:06.583
Bobby!

1831
01:48:06.666 --> 01:48:08.208
Investigate her for me.

1832
01:48:08.291 --> 01:48:09.833
whatever the cost.

1833
01:48:09.916 --> 01:48:12.791
I heard you're
from the same hometown as Mai.

1834
01:48:13.958 --> 01:48:16.541
I'll tell you. Don't tell anyone.

1835
01:48:16.625 --> 01:48:17.958
When we were younger.

1836
01:48:18.041 --> 01:48:19.291
Mai was…

1837
01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:23.375
She was a prostitute.

1838
01:48:25.833 --> 01:48:28.625
She sold her virginity
and got pregnant with Binh Minh.

1839
01:48:31.458 --> 01:48:33.000
Let's go home. Mom.

1840
01:48:33.708 --> 01:48:35.875
-Dao!
-Why are you so cruel?

1841
01:48:36.416 --> 01:48:40.791
You made this up to insult her just
because you don't want us to be together?

1842
01:48:40.875 --> 01:48:43.250
Do you need to stoop this low?

1843
01:48:43.333 --> 01:48:45.041
Why did you need to make this up?

1844
01:48:45.125 --> 01:48:46.208
Who made it up?

1845
01:48:46.291 --> 01:48:48.791
How dare you call your ma a liar?

1846
01:48:48.875 --> 01:48:51.291
Bobby. tell him.

1847
01:48:51.375 --> 01:48:52.458
What the hell do you know!

1848
01:48:52.541 --> 01:48:54.625
He hasn't even said a word.

1849
01:48:54.708 --> 01:48:56.041
Watch your damn mouth.

1850
01:48:56.125 --> 01:48:58.875
-Tell him to come out.
-Let's go. Mom.

1851
01:48:58.958 --> 01:49:00.166
Mai!

1852
01:49:14.750 --> 01:49:16.041
Dad!

1853
01:49:16.916 --> 01:49:18.000
Dad!

1854
01:49:20.541 --> 01:49:21.708
Sit down.

1855
01:49:26.875 --> 01:49:28.875
Tell them. Tell them everything.

1856
01:49:36.583 --> 01:49:40.250
I've told them about your past.

1857
01:49:41.708 --> 01:49:44.125
I thought Duong should know too.

1858
01:49:44.208 --> 01:49:46.958
I think…

1859
01:49:47.041 --> 01:49:49.333
this will be good for you two.

1860
01:49:49.416 --> 01:49:51.375
She's right.

1861
01:49:51.458 --> 01:49:53.750
You two don't have a future together.

1862
01:49:53.833 --> 01:49:56.833
Just return him to his family.

1863
01:49:56.916 --> 01:49:59.666
so he can have a future as they want.

1864
01:50:00.250 --> 01:50:01.791
She promised us a sum of money.

1865
01:50:02.458 --> 01:50:05.833
I get some. you get some.
so does Binh Minh.

1866
01:50:05.916 --> 01:50:07.708
Then we can do whatever we want.

1867
01:50:07.791 --> 01:50:11.791
You can't do anything for him.

1868
01:50:11.875 --> 01:50:14.125
other than disrupt his future.

1869
01:50:14.208 --> 01:50:15.958
Is my daughter gonna be okay
if we drug her?

1870
01:50:16.958 --> 01:50:19.583
What are you worried about?
Might as well make some money.

1871
01:50:19.666 --> 01:50:21.416
Then you can take care of your sick wife.

1872
01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:24.083
Every girl loses it at some point.

1873
01:50:26.083 --> 01:50:27.625
I have no choice.

1874
01:50:29.583 --> 01:50:31.291
We were so poor.

1875
01:50:31.375 --> 01:50:33.458
I was neck-deep in debt.

1876
01:50:33.541 --> 01:50:35.375
Your mom was dying.

1877
01:50:35.458 --> 01:50:36.916
You're my daughter.

1878
01:50:37.958 --> 01:50:39.583
You ought to sacrifice for our family.

1879
01:50:40.208 --> 01:50:42.291
Mai! What's wrong with you?

1880
01:50:42.375 --> 01:50:44.166
You're fucking crazy!

1881
01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.125
I'm sorry.

1882
01:51:02.625 --> 01:51:04.625
We can do whatever we want.

1883
01:51:04.708 --> 01:51:08.125
Give him back to his family.
so he can have a future.

1884
01:51:08.208 --> 01:51:10.208
You're holding him down.

1885
01:51:13.291 --> 01:51:16.500
We're not on the same level with him.

1886
01:51:16.583 --> 01:51:18.666
He can't do anything for you either.

1887
01:51:18.750 --> 01:51:20.333
How can you…

1888
01:51:22.250 --> 01:51:24.583
How can you be that bad to me?

1889
01:51:24.666 --> 01:51:26.833
I just want what's best for you.

1890
01:51:26.916 --> 01:51:28.291
What are you doing?

1891
01:51:28.375 --> 01:51:30.250
-How can you sell me twice like that?
-Mom!

1892
01:51:30.333 --> 01:51:32.208
-How far is enough?
-Mom!

1893
01:51:32.291 --> 01:51:33.750
-Let me go.
-Mom!

1894
01:51:33.833 --> 01:51:35.916
-It's what good for you.
-And you…

1895
01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:37.916
How can treat me this way?

1896
01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.375
-How can you hurt my child that much?
-Mom.

1897
01:51:40.458 --> 01:51:41.833
I didn't want to.

1898
01:51:41.916 --> 01:51:44.333
I tried my best to convince you guys.

1899
01:51:44.416 --> 01:51:45.666
Calm down. Look at me. Calm down.

1900
01:51:45.750 --> 01:51:47.875
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1901
01:51:47.958 --> 01:51:49.500
He told me a long time ago.

1902
01:51:49.583 --> 01:51:51.666
It's okay. Mom.

1903
01:51:52.333 --> 01:51:54.166
She's old enough. She needs to know.

1904
01:51:54.750 --> 01:51:56.708
I've buried it for so long.

1905
01:51:57.375 --> 01:51:59.708
and you did what?

1906
01:51:59.791 --> 01:52:01.250
You're a father.

1907
01:52:01.333 --> 01:52:02.250
and you're a mother.

1908
01:52:02.333 --> 01:52:04.625
How can you be so cruel to me?

1909
01:52:04.708 --> 01:52:07.583
How can you ask people to love you
when your family is so messy?

1910
01:52:07.666 --> 01:52:09.208
And you have the guts to yell at us?

1911
01:52:09.291 --> 01:52:10.375
Sau!

1912
01:52:10.458 --> 01:52:11.875
Can you see this?

1913
01:52:11.958 --> 01:52:13.791
This is all your fault.

1914
01:52:13.875 --> 01:52:16.000
-I'm so sorry.
-You don't need to say sorry.

1915
01:52:16.083 --> 01:52:18.041
Let's go home. Mom. Let's go.

1916
01:52:18.125 --> 01:52:20.000
Let me go.

1917
01:52:20.083 --> 01:52:21.958
It's okay. it's okay.

1918
01:52:22.041 --> 01:52:23.041
I'm right here.

1919
01:52:23.958 --> 01:52:26.166
I'm right here. It's okay.

1920
01:52:26.250 --> 01:52:27.166
Mom.

1921
01:52:27.791 --> 01:52:28.875
MaMi.

1922
01:52:29.416 --> 01:52:30.541
sir.

1923
01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.208
I don't care what her past is like.

1924
01:52:38.250 --> 01:52:39.291
I just want to marry her.

1925
01:52:40.416 --> 01:52:41.333
What the heck?

1926
01:52:41.416 --> 01:52:44.041
Duong. you're in too deep! You're insane!

1927
01:52:44.125 --> 01:52:45.416
Just go home to your family.

1928
01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:46.583
I don't need you to.

1929
01:52:46.666 --> 01:52:48.250
Are you even thinking straight?

1930
01:52:48.833 --> 01:52:49.875
You pick that trash

1931
01:52:49.958 --> 01:52:51.708
over your mom?

1932
01:52:51.791 --> 01:52:53.166
What is she to you?

1933
01:52:53.250 --> 01:52:56.333
Do you really want me to remind you that
she's just a fucking masseuse?

1934
01:52:56.416 --> 01:52:58.041
-Enough.
-What's enough?

1935
01:52:58.125 --> 01:53:01.083
She dates you. she can date anyone.
She meets hundreds of dudes every day.

1936
01:53:01.166 --> 01:53:02.708
Are you out of your mind?

1937
01:53:02.791 --> 01:53:04.541
You're treating your mom like that
because of her?

1938
01:53:04.625 --> 01:53:05.750
Is she worth it?

1939
01:53:05.833 --> 01:53:07.125
What did you tell me?

1940
01:53:07.208 --> 01:53:09.125
You said she was hot. that she was easy.

1941
01:53:09.208 --> 01:53:10.375
-I said enough.
-You said she was different.

1942
01:53:10.458 --> 01:53:12.041
so you approached her
just to have a fuck for fun.

1943
01:53:12.125 --> 01:53:14.625
‎-Watch your mouth!
‎-What the hell!

1944
01:53:14.708 --> 01:53:16.750
Duong. I'm begging you.

1945
01:53:16.833 --> 01:53:18.208
What's happening?

1946
01:53:18.875 --> 01:53:20.083
Is that true?

1947
01:53:20.166 --> 01:53:22.291
-Bobby!
-I'm your friend.

1948
01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:24.625
Asshole!

1949
01:53:25.250 --> 01:53:26.458

You're acting like I'm fucking you over.

1958
01:54:01.458 --> 01:54:03.000
How can you refuse your future?

1959
01:54:03.083 --> 01:54:04.458
Are you insane?

1960
01:54:08.458 --> 01:54:09.583
I told you I have no choice.

1961
01:54:09.666 --> 01:54:11.125
I really don't.

1962
01:54:11.208 --> 01:54:13.458
I have no way to make money.

1963
01:54:13.541 --> 01:54:15.666
I really. really don't.

1964
01:54:16.250 --> 01:54:18.416
What can he do for you?

1965
01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:20.875
You're making me
the bad guy of this family!

1966
01:54:20.958 --> 01:54:22.666
I'm doing what's best for you.

1967
01:54:22.750 --> 01:54:24.500
Everyone gets some money.

1968
01:54:24.583 --> 01:54:26.125
What are you doing?

1969
01:54:26.208 --> 01:54:27.791
What are you doing?

1970
01:54:27.875 --> 01:54:28.916
Let go of me.

1971
01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:30.500
Mai!

1972
01:54:31.833 --> 01:54:32.958
Mai!

1973
01:54:34.291 --> 01:54:36.041
Mai!

1974
01:54:36.708 --> 01:54:38.916
Are you fucking crazy?

1975
01:55:14.500 --> 01:55:15.791
Mister!

1976
01:55:15.875 --> 01:55:17.375
Hey!

1977
01:55:17.458 --> 01:55:18.375
Everyone!

1978
01:55:18.458 --> 01:55:20.041
Call an ambulance!

1979
01:56:36.791 --> 01:56:38.166
Mai.

1980
01:56:38.250 --> 01:56:39.166
Can we--

1981
01:56:39.250 --> 01:56:41.291
Stop trying to persuade me.

1982
01:56:41.375 --> 01:56:43.000
We've talked this over.

1983
01:56:44.833 --> 01:56:46.791
I'm done being in love.

1984
01:56:48.791 --> 01:56:50.208
I'm tired.

1985
01:56:51.916 --> 01:56:56.791
It'd be really selfish of us to keep being
together when your mom is in that state.

1986
01:56:58.208 --> 01:57:00.375
You're only 30.

1987
01:57:00.458 --> 01:57:01.791
Your life just started.

1988
01:57:02.375 --> 01:57:03.958
Don't treat your mother even worse

1989
01:57:04.041 --> 01:57:06.083
just because of me.

1990
01:57:08.125 --> 01:57:09.666
I've been thinking…

1991
01:57:10.625 --> 01:57:12.458
where did we go wrong?

1992
01:57:14.916 --> 01:57:16.541
We met at the wrong time.

1993
01:57:19.250 --> 01:57:20.583
Mai…

1994
01:57:21.208 --> 01:57:22.833
Give me two years.

1995
01:57:22.916 --> 01:57:25.291
I promise I'll try my best
in those two years.

1996
01:57:25.375 --> 01:57:27.750
When Mom gets better. I'll figure us out.

1997
01:57:27.833 --> 01:57:30.291
In those two years.

1998
01:57:30.375 --> 01:57:33.083
if you meet someone. then I'll be happy.

1999
01:57:33.166 --> 01:57:34.416
But if you don't.

2000
01:57:34.500 --> 01:57:35.708
please wait for me.

2001
01:57:35.791 --> 01:57:37.166
Please. I'm begging you.

2002
01:57:37.250 --> 01:57:38.750
Please!

2003
01:57:38.833 --> 01:57:41.000
Okay? Please.

2004
01:57:42.500 --> 01:57:43.416
Sau…

2005
01:57:43.500 --> 01:57:45.166
Don't be like that.

2006
01:57:46.833 --> 01:57:48.625
Just do one thing for me.

2007
01:57:50.375 --> 01:57:51.958
Don't wait for me.

2008
01:57:53.583 --> 01:57:54.958
Don't wait for me.

2009
01:57:55.541 --> 01:57:56.791
Promise me.

2010
01:57:59.541 --> 01:58:02.208
If you do. I won't see you again.

2011
01:58:05.250 --> 01:58:06.375
It's okay.

2012
01:58:06.458 --> 01:58:07.833
Don't cry.

2013
01:58:08.791 --> 01:58:12.041
Why am I the one consoling you now?

2014
01:58:12.125 --> 01:58:13.958
Come on. don't cry.

2015
01:58:22.750 --> 01:58:24.125
Sau…

2016
01:58:24.208 --> 01:58:27.125
Do you know what will come
but will never come?

2017
01:58:27.750 --> 01:58:29.416
It's tomorrow.

2018
01:58:30.250 --> 01:58:32.250
So is my happiness. I think.

2019
01:58:34.750 --> 01:58:36.208
I'm leaving now.

2020
01:58:36.875 --> 01:58:38.708

02:03:07.750 --> 02:03:08.666
Runny nose?

2084
02:03:08.750 --> 02:03:11.000
It's not that. It's because…

2085
02:03:11.083 --> 02:03:12.583

Being friends? Don't think about it.

2121

2122
02:04:57.333 --> 02:04:59.250
a husband and a father now.

2123
02:04:59.333 --> 02:05:00.916
Grow up.

2124
02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:02.958
You're too childish sometimes.

2125
02:05:04.958 --> 02:05:07.041
I'm so happy for you.

2126
02:05:08.458 --> 02:05:11.583
See? No one dies from missing someone.

2127
02:05:12.291 --> 02:05:13.458
Be your best.
