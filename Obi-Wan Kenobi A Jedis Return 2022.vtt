20
00:01:27.375 --> 00:01:29.708

just colors on the screen.

<i>But I knew him as Obi-Wan Kenobi.</i>

32

37
00:02:23.291 --> 00:02:26.708

You all right?

99
00:05:31.708 --> 00:05:36.916

to Qui-Gon bringing this kid along.

-Mmm-hmm.
-So. his last dying wish to you

101

is that you carry on with the kid

102
00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:44.125
and you're sort of saying.
"Okay. I'll do it."

But you do it anyway.

106

you look over the scene with Deb

654

see how she wants it to play out.

as I had with Alec.

MCGREGOR: <i>I didn't know Vivien</i>
<i>before we started.</i>

786

<i>And to have it all come</i>
<i>to this giant culmination</i>

952
00:53:29.083 --> 00:53:33.208
it's a mixture where you feel nervous.
but you also feel incredibly excited.

953
00:53:34.625 --> 00:53:37.125
CHRISTENSEN: <i>We've kinda been</i>
<i>building up to this for a while.</i>

954
00:53:37.208 --> 00:53:39.958
the excitement is palpable.

955
00:53:40.041 --> 00:53:43.666
and it's a big deal for me
to get to be back and do this.

956
00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:46.583
I'm excited to see
what they make of it tonight.

957
00:53:46.666 --> 00:53:48.208
It'll be cool to see.

958
00:53:49.333 --> 00:53:51.041
WOMAN: How's everybody doing?

959
00:53:51.125 --> 00:53:52.958
(ALL CHEERING)

960
00:53:55.458 --> 00:53:58.375
I can't hear you!

961
00:53:58.458 --> 00:54:00.291
(ALL CHEERING LOUDLY)

962
00:54:02.958 --> 00:54:06.708
ALL: (CHANTING)
Obi-Wan! Obi-Wan! Obi-Wan!

963
00:54:08.041 --> 00:54:09.458
(CHANTING CONTINUES)

964
00:54:15.416 --> 00:54:17.416
(CHEERING AND APPLAUDING LOUDLY)

965
00:54:30.083 --> 00:54:33.500
Hello there. <i>Star Wars</i> Celebration!

966
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.833
(CHEERING)

967
00:54:37.166 --> 00:54:38.958
We are back!

968
00:54:45.666 --> 00:54:48.500
INGRAM: <i>I was actually very even keel</i>
<i>going out there.</i>

969
00:54:49.416 --> 00:54:51.541
And then I heard the audience
and I was like.

970
00:54:51.625 --> 00:54:56.250
"Oh. my God! This is really happening.
"People are really about to see this."

971
00:55:03.375 --> 00:55:05.583
MCGREGOR: <i>I've never been</i>
<i>to a Celebration before.</i>

972
00:55:05.666 --> 00:55:07.875
so I just wanted to see
what that feels like

973
00:55:07.958 --> 00:55:10.583
and meet real. real <i>Star Wars</i> fans.

974
00:55:12.250 --> 00:55:13.875
MAN 1: <i>I'm just so emotional.</i>

975
00:55:14.041 --> 00:55:19.625
a 50-year-old man crying like I was
in the movie theater in 1977.

976
00:55:22.875 --> 00:55:25.500
MAN 2: <i>It's nice to see Ewan</i>
<i>back in this role.</i>

977
00:55:25.958 --> 00:55:28.625
<i>having Hayden come back</i>
<i>and step in as Darth Vader.</i>

978
00:55:28.708 --> 00:55:30.708
<i>it was just such a great pairing.</i>

979
00:55:31.958 --> 00:55:33.791
(LAUGHS)

980
00:55:33.875 --> 00:55:34.875
Kinda like us.

981
00:55:37.791 --> 00:55:40.416
CHRISTENSEN: <i>You know.</i>
<i>this whole experience has been</i>

982
00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:42.000
<i>rather emotional for me.</i>

983
00:55:42.083 --> 00:55:44.250
I couldn't help
but get a little bit choked up.

984
00:55:47.958 --> 00:55:51.625
MCGREGOR: <i>There's this warmth</i>
<i>from the kids who we made those films for.</i>

985
00:55:52.208 --> 00:55:56.708
<i>We were their</i> Star Wars <i>in the same</i>
<i>way as Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford</i>

986
00:55:56.791 --> 00:55:59.083
and Alec Guinness
were my <i>Star Wars</i> films.

987
00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:02.625
CHOW: <i>We worked very hard for three years.</i>

988
00:56:02.708 --> 00:56:03.958
<i>And we did it for the fans.</i>

989
00:56:04.041 --> 00:56:06.916
So. it was really nice to be able to
come out and share it with them.

990
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.416
