00:01:31.708 --> 00:01:32.667
- [Rebecca] Hey. Jason.

10
00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:33.875
- [Jason] Rebecca!

11
00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.375
How's my favorite author today?

12
00:01:35.458 --> 00:01:36.750
- [Rebecca] Oh. I am only
your favorite author

13
00:01:36.833 --> 00:01:38.333
because of my sales numbers.

14
00:01:38.375 --> 00:01:40.333
- [Jason] Oh. I am shocked!

15
00:01:40.417 --> 00:01:42.875
Shocked. I tell you. that
you would think such a thing!

16
00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.333
It's also about the advertising.

17
00:01:44.417 --> 00:01:45.667
- [Jason laughs]
- And I am worth it.

18
00:01:45.792 --> 00:01:47.750
- [Jason] Yeah. you sure are!

19
00:01:47.833 --> 00:01:49.250
- [Rebecca] Anyway. what's up?

20
00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:50.667
- [Jason] I'm just checking
how the drive is going.

21
00:01:50.708 --> 00:01:52.333
Hopefully. the pass
wasn't too bad today?

22
00:01:52.417 --> 00:01:54.667
- Oh. I actually just
went through there.

23
00:01:54.708 --> 00:01:55.833
No trouble at all.

24
00:01:56.917 --> 00:01:58.583
I honestly cannot believe

25
00:01:58.667 --> 00:02:01.625
how beautiful
everything is out here.

26
00:02:01.625 --> 00:02:03.167
It almost makes me wish

27
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.833
that I spent a little more
time outside of the city.

28
00:02:04.917 --> 00:02:06.333
- [Jason] Almost?

29
00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:07.833
- [Rebecca] Almost.

30
00:02:07.917 --> 00:02:08.875
- [Jason] Just wait until
you arrive at the cabin.

31
00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.750
The scenery is inspiring!

32
00:02:12.458 --> 00:02:14.167
- [Rebecca] I could use a
little inspiration right now.

33
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.292
I just feel drained.

34
00:02:16.375 --> 00:02:18.458
like there's not enough
of me to go around.

35
00:02:18.542 --> 00:02:21.333
After the press tour.
and the publicity shoots.

36
00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:23.875
interviews. podcast spots.

37
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.375
I just feel like
there's nothing left.

38
00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:28.125
- [Jason] That's why I set you
up with this little escape.

39
00:02:28.208 --> 00:02:30.375
- And that is why you are
the best editor ever.

40
00:02:30.458 --> 00:02:31.750
- [Jason] Hey. you deserve this!

41
00:02:31.875 --> 00:02:33.542
Now. right now. I want
you to focus on you

42
00:02:33.625 --> 00:02:34.833
and the new book.

43
00:02:34.875 --> 00:02:36.333
- [Rebecca] I'm gonna
focus on some red wine.

44
00:02:36.417 --> 00:02:38.500
a home cooked meal. a jog.

45
00:02:38.583 --> 00:02:40.708
and then maybe I'll get
around to some writing.

46
00:02:40.792 --> 00:02:42.333
- [Jason] [laughs] Sounds
like a great plan.

47
00:02:42.375 --> 00:02:43.958
If you need anything.

48
00:02:44.042 --> 00:02:45.375
I'm here for you
24/7. day or night.

49
00:02:45.458 --> 00:02:47.000
I'm just a phone
call or text away.

50
00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:48.250
I mean it.

51
00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:49.833
- Thank you. Jason.

52
00:02:49.875 --> 00:02:51.625
I really appreciate
everything that you do for me.

53
00:02:51.708 --> 00:02:53.167
- [Jason] Yeah.

54
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.833
So some housekeeping
for the cabin.

55
00:02:54.917 --> 00:02:56.667
The upstairs is apparently
under construction.

56
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.333
but everything you can want
is on the ground floor.

57
00:02:58.417 --> 00:03:00.208
so I didn't think
it'd be an issue.

58
00:03:00.292 --> 00:03:01.833
- Are there gonna be
workers comin' in and out?

59
00:03:01.917 --> 00:03:03.333
- [Jason] Absolutely not.

60
00:03:03.417 --> 00:03:04.500
Yeah. no one's
gonna disturb you.

61
00:03:04.583 --> 00:03:06.458
- [Rebecca] Sounds
perfect. Thanks.

62
00:03:06.542 --> 00:03:09.042
- [Jason] I am texting you
the wifi information now.

63
00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:10.875
You should be losing
cell service soon.

64
00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.750
and the only way your phone
will work is on the wifi.

65
00:03:12.833 --> 00:03:16.542
- [sighs] I do not know how I
would survive without you.

66
00:03:16.625 --> 00:03:19.333
- [Jason] Be miserable
and unhappy!

67
00:03:19.458 --> 00:03:21.292
- [Rebecca laughs]
- [Jason] Okay.

68
00:03:21.375 --> 00:03:22.750
- All right. Jason. I'll talk
to you in a couple of days.

69
00:03:22.875 --> 00:03:24.292
- [Jason] Okay.

70
00:03:24.375 --> 00:03:25.542
[phone beeps off]

[phone beeps on]

74
00:03:36.875 --> 00:03:38.042
- Hi. honey. How's the drive?

75
00:03:38.125 --> 00:03:39.500
- Hey. Mom!

76
00:03:39.667 --> 00:03:41.333
The road trip has been
pretty enjoyable so far.

77
00:03:41.417 --> 00:03:43.083
- Are you sure you
should be on FaceTime

78
00:03:43.167 --> 00:03:44.417
at the same time
that you're driving?

79
00:03:44.542 --> 00:03:46.208
I hear it's going to snow later.

80
00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:47.750
and that means the
roads will get icy.

81
00:03:47.833 --> 00:03:48.958
- [Rebecca] The phone is
on the dash mount.

82
00:03:49.042 --> 00:03:50.667
My hands are at 10 and 2.

83
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.208
Do not worry.

84
00:03:52.292 --> 00:03:53.333
- [Mom] [scoffs] All this
new fancy technology

85
00:03:53.417 --> 00:03:55.292
makes me nervous.

86
00:03:55.375 --> 00:03:56.500
- [Rebecca] Mom. I just want
to know how you re doing.

87
00:03:56.583 --> 00:03:58.125
- [Mom] That s so sweet of you.

88
00:03:58.208 --> 00:03:59.833
but you should be
concerned with yourself.

89
00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:01.875
I'm not the one who's been
getting my mail stolen.

90
00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.583
- No one is stealing my mail. Mo

91
00:04:03.708 --> 00:04:06.000
There's just not as
much mail these days

92
00:04:06.083 --> 00:04:07.500
as when you were younger.

93
00:04:07.542 --> 00:04:09.500
- [Mom] Maybe you need to
recognize the red flags!

94
00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:11.750
Someone is stealing your mail.

95
00:04:11.875 --> 00:04:13.333
- Who on earth would
want to steal my mail?

96
00:04:13.458 --> 00:04:15.167
- [Mom] Probably the same person

97
00:04:15.208 --> 00:04:16.250
that broke into your
apartment last month

98
00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:17.750
and stole your workout clothes.

99
00:04:17.875 --> 00:04:19.667
- [Rebecca] Just saying.

100
00:04:19.708 --> 00:04:22.458
that maybe you worry
just a little too much.

101
00:04:22.542 --> 00:04:24.333
- And I'm just saying.
you don't worry enough.

102
00:04:24.417 --> 00:04:27.917
- Fine. I will add worrying
to my to-do list.

103
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.292
Besides. the police said

104
00:04:29.375 --> 00:04:32.083
that all of those
things were not related.

105
00:04:32.167 --> 00:04:33.667
I am gonna be fine out here.

106
00:04:33.708 --> 00:04:35.583
If anything. I
will be even safer.

107
00:04:35.667 --> 00:04:37.167
- [Mom] Do you have the number

108
00:04:37.208 --> 00:04:38.833
for the local
emergency services?

109
00:04:38.917 --> 00:04:40.500
- [Rebecca] I'm pretty sure
911 works everywhere.

110
00:04:40.625 --> 00:04:41.792
- That'll get you Highway Patrol

111
00:04:41.875 --> 00:04:43.667
Give me your address
when you get there.

112
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.708
I'll look up the direct
number for the local station.

113
00:04:45.792 --> 00:04:47.500
Oh. and you should bring
them cookies or something.

114
00:04:47.625 --> 00:04:49.167
- [Rebecca] Mom. you know what?

115
00:04:49.208 --> 00:04:50.875
I'm gonna lose
connection here soon.

116
00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.542
and I should really
concentrate on the roads.

117
00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:54.333
especially if they're
gonna get icy.

118
00:04:54.417 --> 00:04:56.542
But I'll call you when I
get to the cabin. okay?

119
00:04:56.625 --> 00:04:58.417
- Oh. okay. baby. I love you.

120
00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.833
- I love you too. Mom.

Yes!

147
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.792
Yeah.

148
00:10:05.875 --> 00:10:08.000
This is gonna be the start
of a beautiful friendship.

149
00:10:08.083 --> 00:10:09.250
[Rebecca giggles]

150
00:10:12.042 --> 00:10:13.708

- Oh. Hi.

161
00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:09.875
- Hello.

162
00:12:10.875 --> 00:12:12.375
- This is awkward.

163
00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.750
I didn't know anyone was
staying here this week.

164
00:12:16.542 --> 00:12:18.083
- I'm sorry. who are you?

165
00:12:18.167 --> 00:12:19.333
- I'm Nathan.

166
00:12:19.417 --> 00:12:20.708
I live just down that way.

167
00:12:20.708 --> 00:12:24.250
Technically. next
door. but I guess.

168
00:12:25.667 --> 00:12:26.917
Again. I didn't
mean to startle you.

169
00:12:29.083 --> 00:12:30.292
- Hi.

170
00:12:30.375 --> 00:12:32.000
I'm Rebecca.

171
00:12:32.083 --> 00:12:33.750
I thought you were a
black bear or something.

172
00:12:33.875 --> 00:12:36.000
- Oh. yeah. we do have
a few around here.

173
00:12:36.042 --> 00:12:38.417
Just. if you do see
one. just remember.

174
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.583
don't run from it.

175
00:12:39.667 --> 00:12:41.083
Black bears chase you down.

176
00:12:41.167 --> 00:12:43.250
- Oh. I didn't run from you.

177
00:12:43.333 --> 00:12:44.708
- Not yet.

178
00:12:46.917 --> 00:12:48.875
- So you're just
supposed to stand there

179
00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.833
and hope the bear

181
00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.458

have to stand your ground

182
00:12:54.542 --> 00:12:55.833
and make a big show of it.

183
00:12:55.917 --> 00:12:58.583
otherwise. they're
programmed to chase you.

184
00:12:58.667 --> 00:13:00.292

185

critters coming around.

189

install that a few months back

waiting for a single woman

193
00:13:18.292 --> 00:13:21.375
to impress with their
woodsy bromides?

194
00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.333

writing retreat.

202

books do you write?

- Hi. Maddi.

- Tell me you're
already in the bathtub

with a glass of
red in your hand.

231

on my to-do list.

were here. Maddi.

brings it all together.

- [gasps] Is that free wine?

00:15:23.042 --> 00:15:25.500
[groans] I am so jealous
of you right now.

241
00:15:25.542 --> 00:15:26.750
Actually. to be honest.

242
00:15:26.833 --> 00:15:28.208
I'm just happy you
took this trip.

243
00:15:28.333 --> 00:15:29.917
I thought I was gonna
have to fly out there

244

and drag your butt
outta the city.

245
00:15:31.833 --> 00:15:32.500
- Yeah. I'm glad you
didn't have to leave

You look sweaty.

Why do you look sweaty?

250
00:15:40.417 --> 00:15:41.875
What have you been doing?
What aren't you telling me?!

251
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.958

you are so nosy.

You know you can't
hide anything from me.

254

- I kinda met this guy.

-His name is Nathan.

He lives next door.

258

I was finishing up my run.
and I just ran into him.

259
00:15:57.375 --> 00:15:59.833
- You didn't offer him a signed
copy of your book. did you?

260
00:15:59.917 --> 00:16:01.042
Last time you tried
that pickup line.

261
00:16:01.167 --> 00:16:02.625
it didn't really work.

262
00:16:02.708 --> 00:16:04.333
- No. I didn't offer him my book

263
00:16:05.333 --> 00:16:06.000
But...

264
00:16:07.208 --> 00:16:08.667
I did ask him if
he knew who I was.

265
00:16:10.417 --> 00:16:13.000
I must have sounded like
such a conceited little brat.

266
00:16:13.042 --> 00:16:14.708
- [Maddison] Were you
able to play it off?

267
00:16:15.708 --> 00:16:17.167
- He wasn't even fazed by it.

268
00:16:17.208 --> 00:16:20.542
Meanwhile. I'm over here
still just mortified.

269
00:16:21.708 --> 00:16:23.125
I do have to say. though.

270
00:16:23.208 --> 00:16:24.583
it's kinda nice to
maybe find someone

271
00:16:24.708 --> 00:16:27.167
who might like me for me.

272
00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:30.833
- You're already plotting to
accidentally run into him.

273
00:16:30.917 --> 00:16:32.917
- That isn't exactly
serendipitous. Maddison.

274
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.792
- [Maddison] Forget that nonsens

275
00:16:34.875 --> 00:16:37.500
Becca. you keep
looking for the one.

276
00:16:38.583 --> 00:16:40.625
You've gotta take the
good that life gives you.

277
00:16:40.708 --> 00:16:42.000
and enjoy it while it lasts.

278

Take a shower. put
on something hot.

ass over there!

his ass in something tight.

the point. okay?

and get some rest.

you later. Maddi.

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:42.667
Well. I look forward to seeing

357
00:21:42.708 --> 00:21:44.500
what you can do
with those hands.

358
00:21:50.875 --> 00:21:53.542
It's nice to just sit here.

359
00:21:56.042 --> 00:21:57.042
- Yeah.

360
00:21:57.125 --> 00:21:58.542
What do you mean?

361
00:21:58.625 --> 00:22:03.333
- Well. just to be here.
present. right now.

362
00:22:03.375 --> 00:22:06.708
Not rushing. or worrying
about the next flight.

363
00:22:06.708 --> 00:22:08.458
the next car.

364
00:22:08.542 --> 00:22:10.708
- It must be tough being
on the road all the time.

365
00:22:10.792 --> 00:22:11.833
- It gets lonely.

366
00:22:12.542 --> 00:22:14.042
Yup.

367
00:22:14.125 --> 00:22:15.292
You spend most of your
time in front of a screen.

368
00:22:15.375 --> 00:22:17.000
and then you're forced through

369
00:22:17.042 --> 00:22:21.500
endless meetings and
interviews. one after another.

370
00:22:21.542 --> 00:22:23.917
Just fall away
from all the things

371
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.417
that tether you to your world.

372
00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.042
No time to hang out
with your friends.

373
00:22:27.167 --> 00:22:29.958
or even just watch TV.

374
00:22:30.875 --> 00:22:31.833
Wow!

375
00:22:31.958 --> 00:22:33.083
I am...

376
00:22:33.167 --> 00:22:34.750
I'm sorry to just unload on you.

377
00:22:34.833 --> 00:22:36.083
- No. it's okay.

378
00:22:37.542 --> 00:22:39.458
You know. people say
country life is easier.

379
00:22:42.625 --> 00:22:44.458
I used to have a
drinking problem.

380
00:22:46.625 --> 00:22:48.333
- Oh. my gosh! I m so sorry.

381
00:22:48.417 --> 00:22:50.625
I used to have
a drinking problem.

382

Past tense.

383
00:22:53.375 --> 00:22:57.292
I learned to manage it
and only drink occasionally.

384
00:22:57.375 --> 00:22:59.958
I stopped letting it
control my life.

385
00:23:00.042 --> 00:23:01.333
Everything in moderation.

386
00:23:02.708 --> 00:23:05.333
- We learn the most when
we screw it all up.

387
00:23:05.417 --> 00:23:07.333
but in the end.

388
00:23:07.417 --> 00:23:09.125
it's how we handle the
situation and learn from it.

389
00:23:09.208 --> 00:23:11.208
- Hmm.

390
00:23:11.333 --> 00:23:12.708
That's so true.

Nathan?

394
00:23:49.042 --> 00:23:51.167
Nathan. are you in the bathroom?

395
00:24:00.333 --> 00:24:01.792
[birds chirping]

396
00:24:08.625 --> 00:24:09.958
[Rebecca] Wow. Nathan!

[soft piano music]

413
00:25:57.083 --> 00:25:58.708
Okay.

414
00:25:58.833 --> 00:26:01.000
I am too pissed to
be writing romance.

415
00:26:02.542 --> 00:26:03.917
Okay. Rebecca.

416
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.917
You came up here
to write and relax.

417
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.417
not get distracted
by a stupid handyman!

418

[gasps] Oh. there you are!

424
00:26:31.708 --> 00:26:33.167
Hi. Rebecca.

425
00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:33.958
How's the cabin?

426
00:26:34.042 --> 00:26:35.167
- Hi. Mom.

427
00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:36.375
The cabin's great.

428
00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:37.875
- [Mom] Fantastic!

429
00:26:37.958 --> 00:26:40.417
Anyway. I don't expect that's
what you called about?

430
00:26:40.542 --> 00:26:42.042
- No. actually.

431
00:26:42.042 --> 00:26:44.667
I'm just having trouble
focusing this morning.

432
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:45.875
- You know what you need to do?

433
00:26:45.875 --> 00:26:47.708
You need to break
up your routine.

434
00:26:47.792 --> 00:26:49.250
Go out and do
something different.

435
00:26:49.375 --> 00:26:50.833
Go meet somebody new.

436
00:26:50.833 --> 00:26:53.750
- Well. that is kind
of why I'm calling.

437
00:26:55.333 --> 00:26:56.417
I met a guy.

438
00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:57.833
- That's wonderful. sweetie!

439
00:26:57.875 --> 00:26:59.583
Well. who is he?
How tall is he?

440
00:26:59.667 --> 00:27:01.000
Does he attend church?

441
00:27:01.125 --> 00:27:02.000
Because you know your
grandma's gonna want him

442
00:27:02.042 --> 00:27:02.833
to go to church.

443
00:27:02.958 --> 00:27:04.000
- Mom--
- You know what?

444
00:27:04.167 --> 00:27:05.042
You're right. She's old.

445
00:27:05.167 --> 00:27:05.958
We'll just lie to her.

446
00:27:06.042 --> 00:27:06.667
- Mom?!
- What?

447
00:27:06.792 --> 00:27:08.625
- I'm not marrying the guy!

448
00:27:08.708 --> 00:27:10.667
- Well. you're not
getting any younger.

449
00:27:11.625 --> 00:27:13.333
- I just met him yesterday.

450
00:27:13.417 --> 00:27:16.500
and besides. I'm not even
sure that he's the right type.

451
00:27:16.542 --> 00:27:17.875
- [Mom] What does that mean?

452
00:27:19.208 --> 00:27:21.042
- Okay. well. we had a
great night last night.

453
00:27:21.042 --> 00:27:23.458
and then this
morning. I woke up.

454
00:27:23.542 --> 00:27:26.500
and he'd gone through
all my belongings.

455
00:27:26.542 --> 00:27:28.833
and left without
saying anything.

456
00:27:28.875 --> 00:27:30.458
- You mean you went
all the way up there

457
00:27:30.542 --> 00:27:32.708
just to get robbed and stood up?

458
00:27:32.792 --> 00:27:35.333
- Mom. I didn't get robbed!

459
00:27:35.417 --> 00:27:37.708
He just looked through
my stuff and my computer.

460
00:27:37.792 --> 00:27:39.708
- [Mom] Are you sure?
Did you check everything?

461
00:27:39.708 --> 00:27:41.333
Your father and I were
watching the news.

462
00:27:41.417 --> 00:27:43.667
and they were talking about
all sorts of identity theft.

463
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:45.750
They can steal that in
your computer. you know?

464
00:27:45.833 --> 00:27:46.958
- [Rebecca] [groans] Great.

465
00:27:47.042 --> 00:27:49.083
Well. that is just
one more thing

466
00:27:49.167 --> 00:27:51.167
I will add to the list of
things I need to worry about.

467
00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:53.500
- [Mom] My friend. Betsy.
had her identity stolen.

468
00:27:53.542 --> 00:27:57.625
Someone in Wisconsin tried to
buy $2.000 worth of gift cards

469
00:27:57.708 --> 00:27:59.583
from Orange Kitchen Emporium.

470
00:27:59.708 --> 00:28:00.875
Oh. what a wreck that was!

471
00:28:00.958 --> 00:28:02.333
- Okay. I don't think that that'

472
00:28:02.417 --> 00:28:03.333
what's happening here. Mom.

473
00:28:03.375 --> 00:28:04.708
- Who does that?!

474
00:28:04.792 --> 00:28:06.500
- Mom. just slow down. okay?

475
00:28:06.542 --> 00:28:07.625
I called you to vent.

476
00:28:07.708 --> 00:28:09.417
not the other way around.

477
00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:12.667
and you're not really even
letting me get a word in.

478
00:28:12.708 --> 00:28:13.583
- [Mom] You're right.

479
00:28:13.667 --> 00:28:14.792
I'm sorry. honey.

480
00:28:14.875 --> 00:28:17.500
You wanna tell me what happened?

481
00:28:17.542 --> 00:28:18.875
- Not really.

482
00:28:18.958 --> 00:28:20.792
[Mom] What do you
wanna talk about then?

483
00:28:20.875 --> 00:28:22.500
I don't know if I wanna talk
to my mom about my sex life.

484
00:28:22.542 --> 00:28:23.833
- [Mom] Mmm!

485
00:28:23.958 --> 00:28:26.292
Honey. down at
the local library.

486
00:28:26.375 --> 00:28:29.333
my book club and I are
reading your book right now.

487
00:28:29.417 --> 00:28:30.667
- Oh. god!

488
00:28:30.708 --> 00:28:32.125
You did not tell me that.

489
00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:34.500
- [Mom] Oh. I think
we're beyond the point

490
00:28:34.542 --> 00:28:36.625
of being shy about sex.

491
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:37.833
- [Rebecca] Still...

492
00:28:37.917 --> 00:28:39.250
- [Mom] Besides. I'm your mother

493
00:28:39.333 --> 00:28:40.125
You can talk to me.

494
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:44.000
- Is there something
wrong with me?

495
00:28:44.083 --> 00:28:44.500
- [Mom] What?!

496
00:28:44.542 --> 00:28:46.000
Of course not.

497
00:28:46.083 --> 00:28:48.125
- Then why would he
just leave like that?

498
00:28:49.083 --> 00:28:51.292
- [Mom] Sometimes.
people just leave.

499
00:28:51.375 --> 00:28:53.500
Relationships are about
mutually fitting together.

500
00:28:53.542 --> 00:28:55.000
and he was not a fit.

501
00:28:57.792 --> 00:28:59.375
- No. it can't be that simple.

502
00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:00.625
- Why not?

503
00:29:00.708 --> 00:29:02.250
It's always been that way.

504
00:29:02.333 --> 00:29:04.667
Because there is nothing
that I can do about that!

505
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:06.208
- Welcome to being a woman.

506
00:29:07.208 --> 00:29:09.542
But you. you're strong
enough to not need a man

507
00:29:09.625 --> 00:29:11.125
to make you whole.

508
00:29:11.208 --> 00:29:12.333
- You have dad.

509
00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:16.000
- [Mom] Exactly. and I've spent
last 34 years taming him.

510
00:29:16.083 --> 00:29:18.167
He was barely
housebroken when we met.

511
00:29:19.375 --> 00:29:21.625
You can't read into
these things so much.

512
00:29:21.708 --> 00:29:23.167
You had a fun night.

513
00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:24.875
it didn't go any
further. and that's okay.

514
00:29:25.875 --> 00:29:27.750
Reflect on it and move on.

515
00:29:28.667 --> 00:29:31.792
- Yeah. I guess.

516
00:29:31.875 --> 00:29:33.167
- I want you to get married.

517
00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:34.708
but I don't want you
to end up with some bum

518
00:29:34.792 --> 00:29:35.875
who's stupid enough to...

519
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.625
What is it they say these days.

520
00:29:37.708 --> 00:29:39.042
hit it and quit it?

521
00:29:39.792 --> 00:29:41.625
- Okay. you cannot say that.

522
00:29:41.708 --> 00:29:43.167
- [Mom] Why not?

523
00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:44.750
We used to do it all
the time in the '80s.

524
00:29:44.833 --> 00:29:47.167
- I did not need to know that!

525
00:29:47.292 --> 00:29:48.375
Wow. okay.

526
00:29:49.667 --> 00:29:50.708
You know what?

527
00:29:50.792 --> 00:29:52.167
Maybe you are right. okay?

528
00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:54.500
Maybe I am beating
myself up over nothing.

529
00:29:54.583 --> 00:29:56.292
- You're doing great. honey.

530
00:29:56.375 --> 00:29:58.042
You'll meet the right guy
eventually. I promise.

531
00:29:59.542 --> 00:30:00.542
- Thanks. Mom.

532
00:30:00.667 --> 00:30:02.292
- Okay. baby.

533
00:30:02.292 --> 00:30:03.000
I love you.

534
00:30:03.083 --> 00:30:04.542

have a one night stand

about your book.

I have a mask and a knife?

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.458
One. do not try to run.

897
00:54:05.875 --> 00:54:09.750
Two. do not try to fight me.

898
00:54:11.042 --> 00:54:13.833
And three. most importantly.

899
00:54:13.958 --> 00:54:16.458
if you're nice. then I'm nice.

900
00:54:18.333 --> 00:54:20.667
and I want to be nice to you.

901
00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:27.000
Now. are you going to be nice?

902
00:54:34.208 --> 00:54:35.167
Good girl!

903
00:54:35.208 --> 00:54:36.833
Great!

904
00:54:36.958 --> 00:54:38.792
Oh. come with me. I
wanna show you something.

905
00:54:44.292 --> 00:54:45.500
There we go.

906
00:54:45.583 --> 00:54:46.417
Now...

907
00:54:58.750 --> 00:55:00.375
[door thuds shut]

908
00:55:04.375 --> 00:55:06.500
Careful. take your time.

909
00:55:15.833 --> 00:55:16.958
Right up here.

910
00:55:18.542 --> 00:55:19.458
Okay.

911
00:55:22.125 --> 00:55:23.542
Watch your step.

912
00:55:28.875 --> 00:55:29.958
Okay. here we go.

913
00:55:31.375 --> 00:55:32.417
[keypad beeping]
[door lock whirring]

914
00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:35.542
[door clacks open]

915
00:55:38.417 --> 00:55:40.542
I can see everything
that happens here.

916
00:55:44.583 --> 00:55:47.000
Well. it's just to
keep us both safe.

917
00:55:55.792 --> 00:55:57.333
- This is insane.

918
00:56:02.958 --> 00:56:04.000
And these?

919
00:56:05.583 --> 00:56:07.958
- Well. these were more
tastefully spread out

920
00:56:08.042 --> 00:56:09.833
throughout the cabin.

921
00:56:09.875 --> 00:56:11.250
but I had to move them in
here to keep the ruse going.

922
00:56:11.375 --> 00:56:12.083
But we can put
them back out now.

923
00:56:12.167 --> 00:56:13.125
- What ruse?

924
00:56:15.583 --> 00:56:17.750
- This is my cabin.

925
00:56:17.875 --> 00:56:19.000
Pardon me.

926
00:56:19.042 --> 00:56:20.583
This is now our cabin.

927
00:56:20.667 --> 00:56:22.750
- Wait. you said that
this was a rental.

928
00:56:24.083 --> 00:56:25.750
- Well. just a small fib.

929
00:56:25.833 --> 00:56:27.083
Sort of.

930
00:56:27.167 --> 00:56:29.375
I mean. I have rented it before.

931
00:56:29.458 --> 00:56:31.042
- Why did you bring me here?

932
00:56:32.542 --> 00:56:34.042
- To be with you. of course.

933
00:56:36.042 --> 00:56:38.500
- And that's why you were
wearing a mask and chasing me?

934
00:56:38.625 --> 00:56:40.333
- It was just a little game. Bec

935
00:56:40.417 --> 00:56:41.583
You know. a little scare.

936
00:56:41.708 --> 00:56:42.917
People like to be scared.

937
00:56:44.042 --> 00:56:46.042
Just... [sighs]

938
00:56:47.292 --> 00:56:49.500
messed it up by getting that

939
00:56:49.625 --> 00:56:51.458
stupid boy involved.

940
00:56:51.542 --> 00:56:53.417
- What kind of sick
person are you?

941
00:56:55.375 --> 00:56:56.708
- That's not nice.

942
00:56:56.833 --> 00:56:59.667
- You murdered someone
last night.

943
00:56:59.667 --> 00:57:02.250
-That wasn't nice!
-And it's your fault!

944
00:57:02.333 --> 00:57:04.083
He was not supposed to be here!

945
00:57:09.083 --> 00:57:11.458
I told you. I don't
wanna talk about him.

946
00:57:11.542 --> 00:57:13.458
This is making me
really angry. Rebecca.

947
00:57:13.542 --> 00:57:15.667
- I cannot just forget about it.

948
00:57:15.708 --> 00:57:18.125
He died in front of me!

949
00:57:18.208 --> 00:57:19.917
You are a murderer!

950
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.833
[Rebecca grunts angrily]

951
00:57:21.917 --> 00:57:25.167
[head thuds]
[Rebecca grunts]

952
00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:27.083
[Jason sighs]

953
00:58:03.542 --> 00:58:05.458
[Rebecca wincing painfully]

954
00:58:12.042 --> 00:58:14.000
[Jason slurping]

955
00:58:21.042 --> 00:58:21.750
Jason.

956
00:58:23.583 --> 00:58:25.875
Please. just let me go.

957
00:58:25.958 --> 00:58:30.250
- Well. I'd like to. but
that is against the rules.

958
00:58:30.333 --> 00:58:31.625
- I'm serious. Jason.

959
00:58:33.083 --> 00:58:35.208
This isn't funny.

960
00:58:35.292 --> 00:58:36.750
You're gonna be in big trouble.

961
00:58:40.833 --> 00:58:43.208
- There's nothing
funny about love.

962
00:58:43.208 --> 00:58:44.042
- This isn't love.

963
00:58:45.125 --> 00:58:46.167
This is insanity.

964
00:58:46.250 --> 00:58:47.375
You kidnapped me.

965
00:58:47.458 --> 00:58:49.000
You murdered your neighbor!

966
00:58:49.042 --> 00:58:51.125
- [fist thuds]
- Stop talking about him!

967
00:58:51.208 --> 00:58:53.000
I don't like him!

968
00:58:53.042 --> 00:58:54.792
I can't stand people like
him. and I told you that!

969
00:58:57.167 --> 00:58:59.125
You don't even know what
you've done. do you?

970
00:58:59.208 --> 00:59:02.250
-No. no. I have no idea--
-You've ruined everything!

971
00:59:03.833 --> 00:59:05.625
[Rebecca breathes shakily]

972
00:59:05.708 --> 00:59:07.083
- I'm sorry. Jason.

973
00:59:07.208 --> 00:59:08.833
Whatever I did.

974
00:59:08.917 --> 00:59:10.375
- I didn't mean to.
- You didn't mean to what?

975
00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:12.000
You didn't mean to
screw the very first guy

976
00:59:12.125 --> 00:59:13.000
- you met here?
- I didn't think--

977
00:59:13.083 --> 00:59:14.000
Liar!

978
00:59:15.417 --> 00:59:17.625
Are you trying to tell me
that a smart woman like you

979
00:59:17.708 --> 00:59:19.375
didn't know exactly
what she was doing.

980
00:59:19.375 --> 00:59:20.833
that she didn't
choose to screw him?

981
00:59:20.917 --> 00:59:23.000
No. no. I watched the
whole thing. Rebecca.

982
00:59:23.875 --> 00:59:25.833
I saw how you shook your ass

983
00:59:25.917 --> 00:59:27.333
when you first met
him in the woods.

984
00:59:27.375 --> 00:59:29.083
but I never thought you'd
throw yourself at him

985
00:59:29.167 --> 00:59:30.208
like a common whore!

986
00:59:32.167 --> 00:59:34.167
- [sniffles] Okay. okay.

987
00:59:34.208 --> 00:59:35.625
[Rebecca stammers]

988
00:59:35.708 --> 00:59:37.000
So this is just

989
00:59:37.042 --> 00:59:39.417
- all about Nathan and...
- [Jason scoffs]

990
00:59:39.542 --> 00:59:40.333
- No.

991
00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:43.417
[Jason groans]

992
00:59:43.542 --> 00:59:48.125
No. it's not about the handyman.

993
00:59:48.208 --> 00:59:50.208
the fence builder.

994
00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:54.333
I guess I should be happy
you didn't order a pizza.

995
00:59:54.417 --> 00:59:56.292
otherwise. you'd be in the
backseat of a hatchback

996
00:59:56.375 --> 00:59:57.417
moaning into the headrest.

997
00:59:57.500 --> 00:59:59.542
- It was just a fling. okay?

998
00:59:59.625 --> 01:00:00.542
It didn't mean anything.

999
01:00:00.625 --> 01:00:02.667
I promise. Jason.

1000
01:00:03.917 --> 01:00:06.500
Had I known. I never
would've slept with him.

1001
01:00:06.542 --> 01:00:08.875
- Is that supposed to
make me feel better?

1002
01:00:10.125 --> 01:00:12.000
Besides...

1003
01:00:13.542 --> 01:00:16.125
I saw how meaningful
it was for you.

1004
01:00:18.708 --> 01:00:20.750
[Rebecca stammers]

1005
01:00:21.458 --> 01:00:23.000
I just needed to
get out of my head.

1006
01:00:23.083 --> 01:00:25.458
You told me to
change up my routine.

1007
01:00:25.542 --> 01:00:26.875
to try something new.

1008
01:00:27.042 --> 01:00:29.458
We both agreed
that the press tour

1009
01:00:29.542 --> 01:00:30.833
- was just too much.
- No!

1010
01:00:30.917 --> 01:00:32.625
No. don't you dare
put this on me!

1011
01:00:32.708 --> 01:00:34.167
This is not my fault.

1012
01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:36.625
This is about you being
a filthy little tease!

1013
01:00:38.542 --> 01:00:40.625
[Rebecca softly sobs]

1014
01:00:40.708 --> 01:00:42.500
- I'm sorry. Jason.

1015
01:00:42.583 --> 01:00:45.500
I am so sorry.

1016
01:00:45.542 --> 01:00:47.333
- I see you now. Rebecca.

1017
01:00:47.375 --> 01:00:49.750
I see you for who you are.

1018
01:00:51.083 --> 01:00:53.042
Without me. you wouldn't
even have a career!

1019
01:00:53.125 --> 01:00:56.500
Your writing is only
anything because of me!

1020
01:00:56.583 --> 01:00:57.917
I discovered you! I took you in!

1021
01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.667
I gave you everything!

1022
01:00:59.708 --> 01:01:01.167
And how do you repay me?

1023
01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:05.333
By turning me down
again and again.

1024
01:01:05.417 --> 01:01:06.833
and sleeping with the help!

1025
01:01:06.917 --> 01:01:08.750
[slaps]
[Rebecca sobs]

1026
01:01:09.708 --> 01:01:11.125
[Rebecca continues sobbing]

1027
01:01:17.875 --> 01:01:21.417
- Jason. I never
meant to hurt you.

1028
01:01:24.958 --> 01:01:28.000
- You have no idea what hurt is.

1029
01:01:28.875 --> 01:01:30.333
Hurt is what I've
had to live with

1030
01:01:30.417 --> 01:01:32.292
every day since I met you.

1031
01:01:34.875 --> 01:01:37.458
Since the day we danced.
The day we kissed.

1032
01:01:39.625 --> 01:01:40.667
The day we made love.

1033
01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:42.083
- That was one time.

1034
01:01:43.292 --> 01:01:45.333
We both said that we
had too much wine.

1035
01:01:45.375 --> 01:01:48.833
and you told me that it
was water under the bridge.

1036
01:01:48.958 --> 01:01:50.417
You said that it was fine.

1037
01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:52.208
- Well. it's not fine. Rebecca!

1038
01:01:52.292 --> 01:01:54.167
You've ruined my life!

1039
01:01:54.208 --> 01:01:57.042
Every day. I can't stop
thinking about you!

1040
01:01:57.125 --> 01:02:01.000
I go into work. and I see
your face all over my office!

1041
01:02:01.042 --> 01:02:02.958
I have to put your
face on national TV

1042
01:02:03.042 --> 01:02:05.875
and watch as you flirt
with every host out there!

1043
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.167
It's enough to make me puke!

1044
01:02:10.792 --> 01:02:13.000
All I wanted was you.

1045
01:02:13.083 --> 01:02:16.125
but you couldn't bring
yourself to want me!

1046
01:02:17.708 --> 01:02:21.000
[Jason softly sobs]

1047
01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:26.458
[Jason heavily sighs]

1048
01:02:26.542 --> 01:02:28.708
[Rebecca softly cries]

1049
01:02:28.833 --> 01:02:32.125
And that's when I decided
to change everything.

1050
01:02:34.792 --> 01:02:35.708
No more interviews.

1051
01:02:35.792 --> 01:02:37.000
No more press tours.

1052
01:02:37.125 --> 01:02:40.125
No more shaking your ass on TV.

1053
01:02:41.375 --> 01:02:44.167
[soft dramatic music]

1054
01:02:54.708 --> 01:02:59.292
From now on.
it'll just be me and you

1055
01:03:00.917 --> 01:03:03.042
in a cozy little cabin.

1056
01:03:03.125 --> 01:03:05.667
where we live our
happily ever after.

1057
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:08.750
After all. we have enough money.

1058
01:03:08.875 --> 01:03:09.833
We don't need anything.

1059
01:03:09.917 --> 01:03:12.042
We can live here forever.

1060
01:03:13.583 --> 01:03:15.792
- No.

1061
01:03:15.875 --> 01:03:19.458
You cannot keep me here.

1062
01:03:19.542 --> 01:03:23.667
- Bec. I have a camera in every
room. looking at every door.

1063
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:25.250
I get a notification

1064
01:03:25.333 --> 01:03:27.250
every time something
moves in this house.

1065
01:03:27.333 --> 01:03:29.417
I know everything that
happens here and around here.

1066
01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:31.333
Trust me.

1067
01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:40.208
- What are you gonna do to me?

1068
01:03:41.333 --> 01:03:43.667
- I'm gonna keep you
here safe with me.

1069
01:03:43.708 --> 01:03:45.167
It'll be perfect.

1070
01:03:45.208 --> 01:03:48.667
Our own little corner
of peace and harmony.

1071
01:03:48.792 --> 01:03:50.083
And the best part is.

1072
01:03:50.167 --> 01:03:51.750
I am going to take
the guest room.

1073
01:03:51.833 --> 01:03:55.917

an office so you can write.

[Rebecca whimpers]

1075
01:04:01.792 --> 01:04:03.667
- And I'm just supposed
to forget about

1076
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:05.458
the rest of my life?

1077
01:04:05.542 --> 01:04:07.833
my friends. my parents?

1078
01:04:09.625 --> 01:04:11.042
- Well. once we've dealt with

1079
01:04:11.125 --> 01:04:12.625
this little rebellious
streak of yours.

1080
01:04:12.708 --> 01:04:15.167
we'll start branching out.

1081
01:04:15.167 --> 01:04:16.542
I mean. we'll have
to give everyone

1082
01:04:16.667 --> 01:04:18.500
the good news sooner or later.

1083
01:04:19.667 --> 01:04:21.625
- I don't wanna do this.

1084
01:04:23.292 --> 01:04:25.125
- You'll learn to.

1085
01:04:27.708 --> 01:04:29.917
- Jason...

1086
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.125
I am not going to
marry you.

1087
01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:40.208

[Rebecca whimpers]

1093
01:05:22.375 --> 01:05:24.042
- Get up.

1094

[Rebecca cries out painfully]

1096
01:05:31.792 --> 01:05:36.458

1097

[soft dramatic music]

1099
01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:57.708
- I think it's time
that I showed you

1100
01:05:59.083 --> 01:06:03.333
just how much I love you.

1101
01:06:03.417 --> 01:06:04.667
- Please.

1102
01:06:04.708 --> 01:06:05.958
- Please. indeed.

1103

- Wait. wait. wait. wait.

1104
01:06:06.875 --> 01:06:08.375
I think...

1105
01:06:08.458 --> 01:06:09.833
I think you might be
going too fast for me.

1106
01:06:09.917 --> 01:06:11.458
- I can go slow.

1107
01:06:11.542 --> 01:06:14.375
- I mean. I think I might
need something to eat.

1108
01:06:14.458 --> 01:06:16.958
I don't remember the
last meal that I had.

1109
01:06:21.250 --> 01:06:23.125
- I could make us breakfast?

1110
01:06:23.125 --> 01:06:25.750
- No. I don't want breakfast.

1111
01:06:25.833 --> 01:06:27.625
- What do you want?

1112
01:06:29.833 --> 01:06:32.375
- What about dinner?

1113
01:06:32.458 --> 01:06:34.167
- Well. it's a little
early for that. isn't it?

1114
01:06:34.292 --> 01:06:38.875
- Like our first dinner
when we...

1115
01:06:38.875 --> 01:06:40.375
-When we--
-Made love?

1116
01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:42.583
- Yeah.

1117
01:06:44.292 --> 01:06:46.208
You wanna get back
to that night. right?

1118
01:06:46.792 --> 01:06:48.125
- More than anything.

1119
01:06:48.208 --> 01:06:50.208
- Well. then. let's recreate it.

1120
01:06:51.042 --> 01:06:52.583
A little symmetry.

1121
01:06:59.958 --> 01:07:01.792

- It was a good night.

1126
01:07:32.708 --> 01:07:35.208
- It was a great night.

1127
01:07:35.292 --> 01:07:38.208
- I had the cheap house salad
and the best carbonara.

1128
01:07:38.292 --> 01:07:39.875
- I had the steak and potato.

1129
01:07:39.958 --> 01:07:41.167
- And the grilled onions.

1130
01:07:41.250 --> 01:07:42.625
And they forgot
about the butter.

1131

[Jason laughs]

1132
01:07:44.250 --> 01:07:45.583
And we had so much
of the house wine.

1133
01:07:45.667 --> 01:07:48.458
We sat there and
talked for hours.

1134
01:07:48.542 --> 01:07:51.083
- Becca. I thought we really
connected that night.

1135
01:07:51.083 --> 01:07:53.958
Then the next day.
you broke it off.

1136
01:07:54.042 --> 01:07:55.250
You said it was a mistake.

1137
01:07:55.333 --> 01:07:57.208
You said that we should
keep it professional.

1138
01:07:58.833 --> 01:08:01.667
- I might have missed what
was right in front of me.

1139
01:08:01.792 --> 01:08:03.625
I made a mistake. Jason.

1140
01:08:03.708 --> 01:08:04.708
I'm sorry.

1141
01:08:06.042 --> 01:08:07.792
- Well. what's different?

1142
01:08:07.875 --> 01:08:09.125
- I wanna see more.

1143
01:08:10.208 --> 01:08:12.167
I wanna see what
my husband's like.

1144
01:08:14.125 --> 01:08:15.042
Come on. Jason.

1145
01:08:15.125 --> 01:08:16.375
Let's have dinner.

1146
01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:19.083
- You know. I actually
took classes

1147
01:08:19.167 --> 01:08:20.917
to make that carbonara you like.

1148
01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.875
- It's serendipity then!

1149
01:08:22.958 --> 01:08:24.500
Let's go on a date!

1150
01:08:25.625 --> 01:08:26.833
- I'd like that.

1151
01:08:27.958 --> 01:08:28.875
- We don't have to wait.

1152
01:08:28.958 --> 01:08:30.292
Let's do it right now.

1153
01:08:30.375 --> 01:08:32.000
- Wouldn't it be more
romantic later?

1154
01:08:32.042 --> 01:08:34.333
- The sooner we get started.

1155
01:08:34.417 --> 01:08:36.500
the sooner we'll get
to where we wanna be.

1156
01:08:38.583 --> 01:08:41.958
- I think I have
everything I need here.

1157
01:08:42.042 --> 01:08:43.917
I even hired the sous chef

1158
01:08:43.917 --> 01:08:45.833
to show me exactly
how to make it.

1159
01:08:45.958 --> 01:08:49.500
Have you ever made fresh pasta?

1160
01:08:49.583 --> 01:08:53.125
- It is one of the--

1164

call anyone. Jason!

01:09:29.333 --> 01:09:30.375
It wasn't me!

1166
01:09:30.458 --> 01:09:32.125
I swear. I didn't call anyone!

been as quiet

when the kids are quiet.

it's usually when
they're up to no good.

have anything outstanding.

out of your hair.
