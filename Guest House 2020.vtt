4
00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:19.032
We can't afford any of these houses.

5
00:02:19.056 --> 00:02:21.176
Look. daddy's gonna help
with the downpayment.

6
00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:22.381
He doesn't even like me.

7
00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:25.138
Oh. he just doesn't
know you well enough yet.

8
00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:26.228
This is it?

9
00:02:26.313 --> 00:02:30.147
- It can't be. this is like a palace.
- I think this is the place.

10
00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:32.186
This is it?

11
00:02:32.277 --> 00:02:34.734
Well. there's edna's car.

12
00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:36.857
- Okay. Mr. bad cop.
- Mm-hmm.

13
00:02:36.948 --> 00:02:39.280
- What's the plan?
- Okay. we've seen... what?

14
00:02:39.368 --> 00:02:42.326
- Six. seven houses already?
- Eleven.

15
00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:45.119
Eleven. right. Yeah. perfect. Okay.

16
00:02:45.207 --> 00:02:47.368
We go in there stone-faced.

17
00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.916
- Stone-faced.
- We show zero emotion. okay?

18
00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:53.837
No matter how much we love this place.
we got to keep our poker faces. okay?

19
00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:56.331
I'll be bad cop.

20
00:02:58.387 --> 00:03:00.093
Hey. you two!

21
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.389
- Shut up and take our money.
- I knew you'd like it.

22
00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:06.967
Why don't you two
follow me into the kitchen?

23
00:03:07.062 --> 00:03:08.177
Poker face?

24
00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:13.603
Oh. holy shit. this kitchen!

25
00:03:14.778 --> 00:03:16.188
Wow.

26
00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:19.487
I mean. I wanna learn
how to make soufflÃ©s in this kitchen.

27
00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:23.487
This coming from a man who can't even
microwave hot dogs in my apartment?

28
00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:25.239
You're goddamn right.

29
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.868
Impressed. So. what's the catch?

30
00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:37.915
Jj

31
00:03:43.807 --> 00:03:46.719
Holy shit. this backyard!

32
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.801
- Shut up and take our money.
- Uh-huh.

33
00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:51.932
It's one of the largest yards in the area.

34
00:03:52.023 --> 00:03:56.232
great for barbecues
and summer fun and debauchery.

35
00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:59.569
Look at this pool.
You know what that means?

36
00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:02.022
- Aqua-aerobics.
- Aqua-aerobics nude.

37
00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:06.531
Does every one of your scenarios
involve me being naked?

38
00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:07.621
I mean. I don't know.

39
00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:11.824
Uh... what's that noise?

40
00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:14.204
- What?
- That... like that loud...

41
00:04:14.296 --> 00:04:15.877
It's like a...

42
00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:17.404
- Throbbing.
- I don't hear anything.

43
00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:19.998
- Okay.
- There's definitely like a...

44
00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:22.046
Throbbing bass line.

45
00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:24.590
It's pretty loud.

46
00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:26.296
- Oh. that.
- Yeah. Yes.

47
00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:28.473
That's nothing.
That's absolutely nothing.

48
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.051
There's just someone
in the guest house.

49
00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:34.725
- Oh. Okay. yeah.
- Okay.

50
00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:56.914
Are you guys here for the party?

51
00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:58.005
Hell no.

52
00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:59.525
Wait. Wait. wait.
Come back. come back!

53
00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:01.068
- I've seen enough. Thank you.
- Thank you. that's great.

54
00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:02.832
No. guys. wait.
Wait. wait. wait. Trust me.

55
00:05:02.928 --> 00:05:05.590
- No. No.
- He'll be out of here in a month.

56
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.046
You could use it as rental property.

57
00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:11.678
Twenty-four hour notice. edna.

58
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.456
Twenty-four hour notice.
You know that shit.

59
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.189
I texted you. faxed you. dm'd you.
I hit you up on MySpace!

60
00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:20.517
Well. you know I don't check my social
media platforms or my text messages

61
00:05:20.612 --> 00:05:22.898
when I'm fucking on hallucinogenics.

62
00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:27.403
Oh. but somehow you managed
to respond with a dick pic.

63
00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:29.680
Yeah. and you should be thanking me.
That was my penis's good side.

64
00:05:29.704 --> 00:05:31.319
Your penis looked depressed.

65
00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:34.739
Well. here it is. guys.

66
00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:36.621
This is it. This is the guest house.

67
00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:38.918
Okay. it's a smaller version
of the big house.

68
00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.542
except for it smells
like bongwater and k-y.

69
00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:44.670
Okay. you seen's it. now take off.

70
00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:47.753
- I think I'm gonna be sick.
- Oh. go. Spatch. spatch!

71
00:05:47.848 --> 00:05:49.258
Sarah!

72
00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:52.265
It's not that bad!

73
00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:53.637
Mm.

74
00:05:55.272 --> 00:05:57.684
- Wanna smoke some weed. bro?
- Oh. no. no. I'm good.

75
00:05:57.774 --> 00:05:59.264
Thank you so much. but. uh. no.

76
00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:01.725
I haven't smoked anything
in a really long time. so...

77
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.402
- Ahem. Mm.
- Yeah. Great. Okay.

78
00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:07.026
You got so much cool.
random stuff in here.

79
00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:09.278
Yeah. well. I'm a collector
of old artifacts.

80
00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:11.280
- Oh. my god. you have a bomb!
- Yeah.

81
00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:12.598
- That's so cool.
- That's cool.

82
00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:15.364
But what about this right here?
This is Tommy Lee's sex swing.

83
00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:18.750
Right on. Great. Uh... cool.

84
00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:20.293
All right. listen.

85
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.621
- Let's get down to brass tacks here.
- Okay.

86
00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:24.206
What is it. what's your name? Blake?

87
00:06:24.301 --> 00:06:25.653
- Blake. yeah.
- Blake. yeah. take a seat.

88
00:06:25.677 --> 00:06:27.530
So. here's the deal.
let me just ask you a question.

89
00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:29.634
Are you guys really thinking
about buying this place.

90
00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:30.887
or you just passing through?

91
00:06:30.974 --> 00:06:33.636
Think we're pretty serious about it.

92
00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:35.968
We-we really... okay.

93
00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:38.428
Really? Here. you want?

94
00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:40.126
Yeah. No. no. no.
That's not why I was looking at it.

95
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.392
It's Peruvian. just came in from El chapo.

96
00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:45.442
Wow. It's still morning.

97
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.986
Yeah. it's pretty great.

98
00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:49.439
Listen. um.
if you buy the place...

99
00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:53.556
If you buy it. right. I mean. I could stay
in the guest house. right?

100
00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.865
I'll pay rent and shit.

101
00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:56.947
- We're good. right? Straight?
- Uh...

102
00:06:57.042 --> 00:06:59.875
Well. that sounds awesome.
it really does.

103
00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:02.577
but. you know. we're thinking. like.
we buy the place...

104
00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:04.162
No. I'm good. Thank you. It's...

105
00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:07.018
Uh. we're thinking if we buy the place.
we'd want access to all of it.

106
00:07:07.052 --> 00:07:08.613
- Which would include the guest house.
- Mm.

107
00:07:08.637 --> 00:07:10.548
You... you understand.

108
00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:12.300
Copy. copy. gotcha. gotcha.

109
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.926
- All right.
- Well. this was awesome.

110
00:07:14.017 --> 00:07:15.382
Uh. very nice to meet you. Mr...

111
00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:18.264
Cockfield. Randy cockfield.

112
00:07:18.355 --> 00:07:19.970
Bye-bye.

113
00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:21.646
Bye. thank you.

114
00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:23.724
- Bye.
- Mm...

115
00:07:23.818 --> 00:07:25.524
- Are you freaking kidding me?
- I know.

116
00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:27.318
But we have to
give him time to move out.

117
00:07:27.405 --> 00:07:29.020
I know. edna told me.

118
00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:31.356
I just don't feel comfortable allowing
some weirdo

119
00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:33.282
to live in our guest house
for three months.

120
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.406
Do you think we could get him out quicker?

121
00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:39.911
I don't know. I mean. he's. like.
an entrepreneur collector guy.

122
00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:41.401
You know. you saw all of his stuff.

123
00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:43.952
What kind of entrepreneur
lives in someone's guest house?

124
00:07:44.047 --> 00:07:47.460
A frugal one? I don't know. I mean.

125
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.279
I didn't sit down and talk with him
about all of his finances and everything.

126
00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:53.090
Look. I know that this is weird. I do.

127
00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:55.513
- You think?
- But aren't you tired?

128
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.215
I'm so tired. I just wanna...

129
00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:00.677
I wanna just lay down. I wanna be home.

130
00:08:00.772 --> 00:08:03.764
And just say. "we live here now.
we're not going anywhere."

131
00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:05.348
I do love that yard.

132
00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:08.401
And the... what about the gazebo?

133
00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.153
Promise me he'll be out soon.
That guy gives off weird vibes.

134
00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:21.323
I pinky-promise.

135
00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:29.084
- I'm serious. babe.
- I-I'm serious. I promise.

136
00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:32.042
As soon as we get settled in here.
I will march right out there.

137
00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:34.924
and I'll say. "you gotta get out of here
in three months."

138
00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:37.381
He's gonna end up...

139
00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:39.431
A week. We can get him
out of there in a week.

140
00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:52.441
- We're doing it.
- We are.

141
00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:55.365
- We are doing this.
- Yeah. This is us. We're doing this.

142
00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:57.443
Jj

143
00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:14.130
- I mean...
- Oh...

144
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.677
I love this photo.

145
00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:18.630
Well. take a look at this.

146
00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:27.348
- Later. brah.
- Later... brah.

147
00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:33.186
Oh. yeah.

148
00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:35.442
- Dude. what the fuck?!
- Give it to me.

149
00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:38.294
Look. if you guys are gonna have sex.
can you at least close the door?

150
00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:40.611
Yeah!

151
00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:41.724
- Come join us. Blake.
- No.

152
00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:43.628
Look. we need to set a time
for you to move out.

153
00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:48.330
- Blake! Blake. get in here!
- Uh...

154
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.958
- Yeah?
- Someone's been in our kitchen.

155
00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:52.334
What?

156
00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:55.545
Cupboards are empty. groceries are gone.
Even the gluten-free cookies are gone.

157
00:09:55.595 --> 00:09:57.198
Like. seriously. who the fuck eats those?

158
00:09:57.222 --> 00:09:59.804
Randy. obviously. The fucking moron.

159
00:09:59.891 --> 00:10:01.882
Jj

160
00:10:05.647 --> 00:10:06.727
Mm.

161
00:10:13.363 --> 00:10:15.524
You moved a lot of boxes today.

162
00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:16.900
Yeah. I really did. didn't I?

163
00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:18.652
It was crazy.

164
00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:23.533
So. I thought
that you deserved to be rewarded.

165
00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:26.035
- and tonight...
- Oh...

166
00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:29.209
I thought we could do
anything that you wanted.

167
00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:33.497
- Hmm...
- Hm?

168
00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:37.717
You know. this is
a judgment-free zone. right?

169
00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:39.214
Yeah.

170
00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:41.170
Remember the other day
when you were. uh...

171
00:10:42.183 --> 00:10:43.423
Talking to me like a dude?

172
00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:45.179
Mm-hmm.

173
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.636
I kind of. uh... something about it.
'cause it's...

174
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:51.518
You're acting like dude. but it's you.
but it's you doing that voice...

175
00:10:51.609 --> 00:10:54.066
I gotcha.

176
00:10:59.033 --> 00:11:00.864
- What? Mm-hmm.
- Wha.

177
00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:03.739
What. you hard of hearing there. chief?
I said fuck me. brah.

178
00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.470
Oh. yeah. Yeah. that really works for me.

179
00:11:10.712 --> 00:11:13.124
- Oh. fuck me. bro!
- Oh. my god!

180
00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:23.888
What the fuck?

181
00:11:23.975 --> 00:11:26.091
Um... sorry.

182
00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:35.312
Looks like
he's just doing ayahuasca.

183
00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:37.689
Ayahuasca?
What-what the hell is that?

184
00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:39.987
It's where you.
like. drink a tea from a root.

185
00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:43.157
and you get all sick
and have a spiritual experience.

186
00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:45.701
You'll be all right.
my brother. just let it out.

187
00:11:45.788 --> 00:11:47.699
You're trying to get
all the negativity out.

188
00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:51.282
Let's not let this get in the way.

189
00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:55.328
- Yeah. bro.
- Yeah. brosef?

190
00:11:58.051 --> 00:12:01.043
- Dude. what the fuck?
- Oh. my god.

191
00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:02.823
- No. Wait. wait. wait...
- Dude. I can't. Dude!

192
00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:05.088
Wait. wait. wait.
I'll really work. Hold on...

193
00:12:07.018 --> 00:12:09.384
- Come on.
- He's. like. dying out there.

194
00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:12.346
- Well. it's... part of the experience.
- I can't.

195
00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.126
- Get all the negative energy out.
- Don't just...

196
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.856
All the negativity out.

197
00:12:15.944 --> 00:12:16.944
Fuckin' Randy.

198
00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:19.022
Jj

199
00:12:54.023 --> 00:12:55.388
Oh. god.

200
00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:11.029
Wake up!

201
00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:13.957
Why... why am I being attacked?

202
00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.633
Fuck! Oh. shit!

203
00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.927
Blake. Blake.
what are you doing in my room?

204
00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:29.006
- What are you doing in my room?
- Relax take it in.

205
00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:32.387
Take it in.

206
00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:34.723
Oh. god.

207
00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:36.896
You gotta be out
by the end of the day. Okay?

208
00:13:36.983 --> 00:13:39.023
If you need help paying for a hotel...

209
00:13:39.068 --> 00:13:41.275
Fuck! Or anything. I'll help you out.

210
00:13:41.362 --> 00:13:42.506
but. dude. you crossed a line.

211
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.486
All right. passing out
in front of our house?

212
00:13:44.574 --> 00:13:47.031
Sarah is pissed.
and I'm with her on this one.

213
00:13:47.118 --> 00:13:50.952
Yeah. well. you tell Sarah when it comes
to tenant's rights in California?

214
00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:53.496
It's always pro-motherfuckin' tenant.

215
00:13:57.837 --> 00:14:00.874
Guess what I am. bro? Huh?

216
00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:03.206
I'm your motherfucking tenant!

217
00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:05.292
Goddammit. you're beautiful.

218
00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:14.725
Fuck! Fuck it. I gotta get high.

219
00:14:14.812 --> 00:14:16.302
Please.

220
00:14:16.397 --> 00:14:17.887
- Yes!
- Fuck it.

221
00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:20.974
It was just a matter of time. Bam!

222
00:14:22.153 --> 00:14:25.316
You know. a few years ago.
we totally would have been friends.

223
00:14:25.406 --> 00:14:28.489
Like. in college I was a full-on wild man.

224
00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:30.112
All my friends thought I was a legend.

225
00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:32.569
Oh. shit. well. let's do some coke. bro.

226
00:14:32.663 --> 00:14:34.244
Oh. no. no. no. Just... weed's fine.

227
00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:36.789
- Oh. copy. copy. Gotcha. gotcha.
- Weed's cool.

228
00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:39.492
But I do want to get. like. very high.

229
00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:43.045
Not regular high. but like really high.

230
00:14:43.132 --> 00:14:45.339
- How high?
- As high as I can possibly get.

231
00:14:45.426 --> 00:14:46.904
- I'll do anything.
- You'll do anything?

232
00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:48.714
- Yeah. anything.
- Fucking anything?

233
00:14:50.515 --> 00:14:51.800
- Anything?
- Anything. dude.

234
00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:53.051
C'mon.

235
00:14:54.185 --> 00:14:57.848
C'mon... let's go.

236
00:14:57.939 --> 00:15:00.100
- Let's go.
- I am not fucking doing that.

237
00:15:00.191 --> 00:15:02.557
- You said you'd do anything.
- I'm not doing that.

238
00:15:02.652 --> 00:15:04.984
Just repeat after me. okay?
It's very simple.

239
00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:08.563
- I'm not gay.
- I'm not gay.

240
00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:10.344
So then you're good to do it.
Now suck it. let's go.

241
00:15:10.368 --> 00:15:12.054
Dude. of all the pipes
you got in this place.

242
00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:13.430
why do we gotta smoke
out of this one?

243
00:15:13.454 --> 00:15:15.194
- It's how I sort out my pretenders.
- No.

244
00:15:15.289 --> 00:15:17.951
Okay? If you can suck
on Randy cockfield's dick pipe.

245
00:15:18.042 --> 00:15:20.249
you're good with me. Let's go. suck it.

246
00:15:20.336 --> 00:15:21.730
You like chicks. I know you have a chick.

247
00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:23.369
- Just come on. come close.
- Fine.

248
00:15:23.464 --> 00:15:24.670
This makes you my real friend.

249
00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:26.622
- Come on. get close.
- Okay. okay.

250
00:15:38.896 --> 00:15:40.332
- Delete that shit.
- No. no. no. no...

251
00:15:40.356 --> 00:15:42.267
- Delete that! Delete that shit!
- No. no. no.

252
00:15:42.358 --> 00:15:44.253
- I need more followers. bro.
- Dude. I have a job.

253
00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:46.859
I have a girlfriend. Delete that shit.

254
00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:48.937
Jj

255
00:15:56.414 --> 00:15:59.622
Oh. my god! Whoa!

256
00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:16.297
Blow in my face...

257
00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:29.527
Dude. I'm totally gonna sneak in here
all the time and smoke that dick!

258
00:16:32.074 --> 00:16:35.487
- I underestimated you. For real.
- Oh. yeah. Thank you. man.

259
00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:37.181
I like hanging out with you. man.
It's very fun.

260
00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:39.412
If you want to hang harder. dude.
check this shit out.

261
00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:41.956
- Look. look.
- All right.

262
00:16:42.043 --> 00:16:43.874
Check out what's in the box!

263
00:16:43.961 --> 00:16:45.872
- Hm?
- Whoa. Whoa. whoa. whoa.

264
00:16:45.963 --> 00:16:48.170
So. you're like...
You're like a drug addict. huh?

265
00:16:48.257 --> 00:16:50.964
Yep. no. I'm a drug connoisseur.

266
00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:52.132
- Yeah.
- Cool.

267
00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.835
Yeah. mixing and matching the drugs

268
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:57.138
is precisely how you don't get
addicted to the drugs.

269
00:16:58.142 --> 00:17:00.537
- Smart. That's really smart.
- Yeah. you gotta mix and match.

270
00:17:00.561 --> 00:17:02.121
But there is one drug that I'm missing.

271
00:17:02.146 --> 00:17:04.603
What's that?

272
00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.932
Dude. your fucking head is gonna spin
when you see this shit.

273
00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:09.713
- We're talking about flakka.
- Flakka.

274
00:17:09.737 --> 00:17:11.352
The drug is called flakka.

275
00:17:11.447 --> 00:17:13.358
Some are calling it
the insanity drug.

276
00:17:13.449 --> 00:17:14.655
The insanity drug.

277
00:17:14.742 --> 00:17:17.023
It is described
as the scariest drug in the world.

278
00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.327
Way more powerful
than heroin or cocaine.

279
00:17:20.414 --> 00:17:23.622
It is a synthetic drug that will alter
your state of mind.

280
00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:25.646
- Extreme delirium.
- Raising body temperature

281
00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:28.537
and causing people
to literally lose their mind.

282
00:17:30.967 --> 00:17:32.923
Dude. you cannot do the flakka. man.

283
00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:34.671
- Why not?
- It's a bad drug!

284
00:17:34.762 --> 00:17:35.922
Yeah. fuckin' bad ass.

285
00:17:36.013 --> 00:17:39.255
You can't do that in my house. man.
That's... that's bad.

286
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:41.787
What's so bad about it? It's not even
fuckin' in California yet.

287
00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:42.811
Relax. dude.

288
00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:44.535
All right. well that's good. That's good.

289
00:17:45.606 --> 00:17:48.293
My friend Benny's this region's supplier.
He's bringing the shit over.

290
00:17:48.317 --> 00:17:51.901
Dude. no. It's a no. man.
I mean. I don't want that on my property.

291
00:17:51.988 --> 00:17:53.103
If Sarah found out...

292
00:17:53.197 --> 00:17:54.562
Oh. Sarah. you know...

293
00:17:54.657 --> 00:17:57.273
Fuckin' Sarah.
Sarah. Sarah. Sarah! All right.

294
00:17:57.368 --> 00:18:00.235
You know. what? Uh...
Hey. fuck you. you fucking asshole.

295
00:18:00.329 --> 00:18:02.516
You know what? You can't hang with me
anyways. you little party pussy.

296
00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:03.850
You know. spatch.
Get out of my place.

297
00:18:03.874 --> 00:18:08.083
Yeah. I'll spatch.
you fucking pathetic. crusty fuck.

298
00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:11.037
Yeah. you can't even hang out
in my lair. you piece of shit.

299
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:16.091
Hey. babe?

300
00:18:16.178 --> 00:18:19.386
Maybe we can stop by the hardware store
and get some lights for the gazebo.

301
00:18:19.473 --> 00:18:22.761
Yeah. that'd be...
Yeah. that'd be... mm... great.

302
00:18:22.852 --> 00:18:25.059
Did you have a talk with Randy today?

303
00:18:25.146 --> 00:18:27.478
L... yeah. Yeah. we... more...

304
00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:29.396
Yeah. more or less we had the talk.

305
00:18:29.483 --> 00:18:31.974
It got... it was serious
and he's... he's now...

306
00:18:32.069 --> 00:18:34.606
He's dedicated to finding a new place.

307
00:18:34.697 --> 00:18:36.858
- Blake.
- Was that...? Yeah.

308
00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:39.611
- Are you okay?
- I'm good. yeah.

309
00:18:39.702 --> 00:18:41.363
Yeah. I'm ju... yeah. I'm. like tired.

310
00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:43.820
I'm kinda tired from. like...
I didn't sleep that great.

311
00:18:43.914 --> 00:18:45.950
You're high.

312
00:18:46.042 --> 00:18:47.498
No. I'm not. You're. hon...

313
00:18:48.711 --> 00:18:50.201
You're totally high.

314
00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:52.503
- You... he was smoking...
- Mm-hmm.

315
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.080
And I may have breathed some in.

316
00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:55.460
- Just stop talking.
- Okay.

317
00:18:55.551 --> 00:18:58.151
Whoa. but I do think you should know.
there was a cloud. Like a...

318
00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:00.670
Look. Blake. I ask you to go out there
and do one thing.

319
00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:02.993
just get rid of the guy.
and instead you get baked with him?

320
00:19:03.017 --> 00:19:05.508
No. I didn't. I... I was like...

321
00:19:05.603 --> 00:19:07.764
We were unwinding.

322
00:19:07.855 --> 00:19:10.517
I was just unwinding.
Like. I'm... I've been stressed.

323
00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:13.350
Oh. Oh. you've...
You've been stressed.

324
00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:17.569
Mm-hmm. You know. you know.
I've been stressed. too.

325
00:19:17.657 --> 00:19:20.865
You know. teaching
48 second graders a day isn't easy.

326
00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:23.828
Yeah. no. I know.

327
00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:27.155
Do you really? Because while you go off
to your skateboarding job every day

328
00:19:27.249 --> 00:19:29.706
and talk about things
that nobody over 30 cares about.

329
00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:31.250
I'm dealing with angry parents

330
00:19:31.337 --> 00:19:34.420
and trying to figure out how to pay
for school supplies with zero budget.

331
00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:37.214
And then I get to come home
and deal with this shit.

332
00:19:37.301 --> 00:19:40.134
I have students who are
way more mature than you are.

333
00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:41.882
I feel like that's kind of unfair.

334
00:19:41.972 --> 00:19:45.180
I mean. I haven't. like. smoked anything
in. like. a long time.

335
00:19:49.438 --> 00:19:51.679
She got you. man. She's right.

336
00:19:57.697 --> 00:19:59.688
What's happening. sweetpea?

337
00:20:02.618 --> 00:20:05.155
I think Blake's on drugs... again.

338
00:20:05.246 --> 00:20:08.909
Good. Then maybe the two of you
should take a little break.

339
00:20:10.751 --> 00:20:12.867
Or a long break. or a permanent break.

340
00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:14.668
Dad. you're not helping.

341
00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:18.418
I need some dad advice.

342
00:20:19.552 --> 00:20:22.259
I love him. But...

343
00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:26.844
- I don't... I don't know what to do. I...
- Sweetheart...

344
00:20:27.852 --> 00:20:31.060
If you are certain that you love this boy.

345
00:20:32.231 --> 00:20:34.267
then just make sure that you have

346
00:20:34.358 --> 00:20:40.820
the unwavering devotion and dedication
that your mother and I share.

347
00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:46.655
Got it. I... I gotta...
I gotta go work this out.

348
00:20:47.913 --> 00:20:50.450
Uh... you wanna use my hotel room?

349
00:20:50.541 --> 00:20:52.998
- What?
- I keep a hotel room.

350
00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:55.497
For the last few months.
I've had a room in town.

351
00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:57.544
You're welcome to it. Okay. no.

352
00:20:57.631 --> 00:21:00.873
- No. that's... yeah. I...
- No problem.

353
00:21:00.968 --> 00:21:03.459
- Have you heard from kip?
- Mm... no.

354
00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:26.232
Fire in the fucking hole!
Oh. shit!

355
00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:34.073
Dude...

356
00:21:36.504 --> 00:21:40.588
I am not stoked to admit this. dude.
but we should tone it down on the turbo.

357
00:21:40.674 --> 00:21:42.652
Uh. do you need. like.
medical attention or anything?

358
00:21:42.676 --> 00:21:44.166
- You good?
- Come on. dude.

359
00:21:44.261 --> 00:21:45.467
- Yeah. sorry.
- Just...

360
00:21:45.554 --> 00:21:47.194
- Come with me. let's talk.
- Yeah. sorry.

361
00:21:47.264 --> 00:21:51.303
We just released that promotional video
for the skateware line. and it's trending.

362
00:21:51.393 --> 00:21:52.829
We got a shout out on kimmel last night.

363
00:21:52.853 --> 00:21:54.613
All of our social media
is kinda blownin' up.

364
00:21:54.688 --> 00:21:57.555
Plus. that kid's mom?
She's not pressing charges anymore.

365
00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:59.265
- Nice!
- Yeah. Yeah. yeah.

366
00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.100
And now you're exactly
seven weeks out

367
00:22:01.195 --> 00:22:03.006
from being able to skateboard
on public property.

368
00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:05.112
Yeah... hey. dude.

369
00:22:05.199 --> 00:22:09.693
You know I've enjoyed this time to be
intimate with my people. right?

370
00:22:09.787 --> 00:22:12.745
Oh. and everyone here loves having you
around. Mr. kapinsky. they...

371
00:22:12.832 --> 00:22:15.323
Blakey-Blake! I have one rule.

372
00:22:15.417 --> 00:22:17.499
You know this. I'm not mister.

373
00:22:17.586 --> 00:22:19.451
- I'm damn well not sir.
- Right.

374
00:22:19.547 --> 00:22:21.333
- Who am I?
- You're shredd.

375
00:22:21.423 --> 00:22:22.879
Yeah. And why?

376
00:22:22.967 --> 00:22:25.629
- Uh...
- Thirty-six skin grafts!

377
00:22:25.719 --> 00:22:31.180
Zero real teeth and more fuckin metal
than you can shake a dick at.

378
00:22:31.267 --> 00:22:33.098
- Right.
- Right. And what's all that from?

379
00:22:33.185 --> 00:22:34.425
Shredding it so fuckin' hard.

380
00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.476
That's right. man.

381
00:22:36.564 --> 00:22:37.974
Fucking shredding!

382
00:22:38.065 --> 00:22:39.771
I'll take...

383
00:22:39.859 --> 00:22:42.692
- Fuck!
- Oh. Jesus.

384
00:22:49.201 --> 00:22:50.031
Oh. yeah.

385
00:22:50.119 --> 00:22:52.360
Why do I have to always
hit a fucking stud?

386
00:22:52.454 --> 00:22:55.241
'Cause you are fuckin' shredd. sir!

387
00:22:55.332 --> 00:22:56.663
- That's why.
- That's right. man.

388
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:59.036
- Fuckin' epic!
- Oh. my god.

389
00:22:59.128 --> 00:23:01.119
Let's see some skating around here!

390
00:23:03.591 --> 00:23:04.626
Yol

391
00:23:05.968 --> 00:23:08.050
all right. All right.

392
00:23:11.307 --> 00:23:12.843
Isn't the architecture great?

393
00:23:12.933 --> 00:23:14.995
I mean. I can see myself
getting married in this house.

394
00:23:15.019 --> 00:23:16.429
Sar-bear. I love you.

395
00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:19.887
so I'm gonna tell you this
as delicately as possible.

396
00:23:19.982 --> 00:23:21.722
You could do so much better.

397
00:23:22.735 --> 00:23:24.066
I love Blake.

398
00:23:24.153 --> 00:23:26.394
He's amazing.
I mean. he's everything...

399
00:23:26.488 --> 00:23:29.446
Listen. whatever you decide.
know that I'll always have your back.

400
00:23:29.533 --> 00:23:31.973
I just... I always envisioned
your life differently. you know?

401
00:23:32.036 --> 00:23:34.448
Like. more like mine.
where I have this job

402
00:23:34.538 --> 00:23:36.683
where I don't do a lot of work.
but I make a lot of money?

403
00:23:36.707 --> 00:23:38.163
I know.

404
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:43.085
- And I know he's the one.
- You know?

405
00:23:43.172 --> 00:23:48.383
You know. Just like in college.
when you knew that you didn't like girls.

406
00:23:48.469 --> 00:23:50.960
Seriously. don't even right now.

407
00:23:51.055 --> 00:23:54.843
If Blake heard you. he would never stop
hounding me for a threesome.

408
00:23:54.934 --> 00:23:56.549
Shit. really?

409
00:23:56.644 --> 00:23:58.384
You know. I'm totally down for that.

410
00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:04.640
Whoa...

411
00:24:06.612 --> 00:24:08.318
Oh. sh...

412
00:24:12.409 --> 00:24:16.243
Hey. skippy. What's up. boy?

413
00:24:18.207 --> 00:24:21.370
Meow. Me... Jesus!

414
00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:24.623
That's not a... fucking cat. Blake!

415
00:24:24.713 --> 00:24:27.079
What the fuck? Blake. there's a...

416
00:24:27.174 --> 00:24:30.132
There's a goddamn muskrat on your porch!

417
00:24:30.219 --> 00:24:31.379
Help. Blake!

418
00:24:35.891 --> 00:24:37.506
I ooks like someone's off the market.

419
00:24:37.601 --> 00:24:40.388
- I mean. you're not married yet. Right?
- Yeah. No.

420
00:24:41.438 --> 00:24:43.554
So. what do you say
we have one last office fling?

421
00:24:43.649 --> 00:24:45.355
Holy shit.

422
00:24:45.442 --> 00:24:48.809
Uh. I don't... I don't think
that we can do that.

423
00:24:48.904 --> 00:24:52.021
- Yeah? Come on.
- Know if I should.

424
00:24:52.116 --> 00:24:53.843
- What happened to fun Blake?
- No. he's right here.

425
00:24:53.867 --> 00:24:57.826
I'm still super fun. I just. you know.
I'm serious with Sarah. and. you know...

426
00:24:57.913 --> 00:24:59.778
- You wanna shred me?
- I shouldn't.

427
00:24:59.873 --> 00:25:01.559
You know... hey. hey. hey.
let's just pause this.

428
00:25:01.583 --> 00:25:03.119
- take a...
- Blakey-Blake!

429
00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:06.543
Whoa! What the fuck are you doing?

430
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:08.066
I'm not... it's not what it looks like.

431
00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:10.126
- I... I know.
- Come on.

432
00:25:10.217 --> 00:25:12.629
You're unbuckled.
your fly's down.

433
00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.155
Look. I don't know how she got fly down.

434
00:25:14.179 --> 00:25:16.386
That was all that happened.
it was a misunderstanding.

435
00:25:16.473 --> 00:25:19.715
Bro-man. dude.
You have a woman now.

436
00:25:21.311 --> 00:25:23.677
You got me really worried about you.

437
00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:26.090
- I appreciate...
- I don't like it.

438
00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:27.150
Got it.

439
00:25:28.068 --> 00:25:29.068
Sorry.

440
00:25:31.113 --> 00:25:32.319
Yep.

441
00:25:32.489 --> 00:25:34.400
Jj

442
00:25:43.792 --> 00:25:44.907
How was everything?

443
00:25:45.002 --> 00:25:47.368
Would you say
your spinach was leafy?

444
00:25:47.463 --> 00:25:50.170
Look. I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.

445
00:25:50.257 --> 00:25:52.589
- I've been stressed with work.
- Yeah. no. no.

446
00:25:52.676 --> 00:25:55.167
I know. I'm sorry. though. too.

447
00:25:55.262 --> 00:25:57.924
Obviously.
I should be more sorry than you.

448
00:25:58.015 --> 00:26:01.599
I mean. the Randy situation is horrible.

449
00:26:01.685 --> 00:26:04.176
but none of that really matters.

450
00:26:04.271 --> 00:26:06.887
This is all that matters. You and me.

451
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.982
- I love you.
- I love you. too.

452
00:26:18.368 --> 00:26:19.608
I love you.

453
00:26:19.703 --> 00:26:23.241
And... I want to marry you.

454
00:26:24.583 --> 00:26:28.417
L. um. don't actually have a ring.
but I could do that.

455
00:26:29.713 --> 00:26:32.329
I just kind of arrived at this.

456
00:26:33.967 --> 00:26:35.673
This is a mean. mean joke.

457
00:26:35.761 --> 00:26:39.845
No. I'm not joking. I'm so serious.

458
00:26:41.558 --> 00:26:44.925
- You're like for real. real?
- Yeah.

459
00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.352
We can do it here in this house.

460
00:26:47.439 --> 00:26:50.681
What better way to christen it?

461
00:26:50.776 --> 00:26:52.696
- Don't fuck with me.
- I'm not fucking with you.

462
00:26:52.736 --> 00:26:54.422
- You guys. I just needed a can opener.
- Jesus.

463
00:26:54.446 --> 00:26:56.216
- Don't have a cap opener.
- There is no chance

464
00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.276
- you don't have a can opener.
- We don't have one.

465
00:26:58.367 --> 00:27:00.762
- Is this a bad time. or...?
- This is an extremely bad time.

466
00:27:00.786 --> 00:27:01.696
- Really?
- Yeah.

467
00:27:01.787 --> 00:27:03.598
- Did you drop your contact or something?
- No. it's more serious than that.

468
00:27:03.622 --> 00:27:06.455
- Oh. shit. I'm sorry. sorry.
- Yeah. yeah.

469
00:27:06.542 --> 00:27:08.144
- We're having a moment.
- I like you guys. you're cool.

470
00:27:08.168 --> 00:27:11.410
Bev! Beverly!

471
00:27:12.422 --> 00:27:14.879
- Bev!
- Yeah?

472
00:27:14.967 --> 00:27:17.299
Come on in here.
We're doing the Skype.

473
00:27:17.386 --> 00:27:19.697
- Oh. goodie. goodie. goodie...
- Come here. she wants to see you.

474
00:27:19.721 --> 00:27:21.803
- Sarah!
- We're getting married!

475
00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:23.676
Wait a minute. what?

476
00:27:23.767 --> 00:27:25.803
Hold on. shush!
What did you...? Hold on!

477
00:27:25.894 --> 00:27:27.705
- That's amazing news. sweetheart.
- No. no. no. you didn't say...

478
00:27:27.729 --> 00:27:30.766
No. I came home.
and he had this amazing dinner laid out.

479
00:27:30.858 --> 00:27:33.565
- and he proposed.
- No! Listen... listen to me.

480
00:27:33.652 --> 00:27:35.672
- I'm so excited!
- Don't do it! The skateboard boy?

481
00:27:35.696 --> 00:27:37.423
- Yes. yes. skateboard boy. Yes.
- Are you insane?

482
00:27:37.447 --> 00:27:38.482
- Listen...
- Blake.

483
00:27:38.574 --> 00:27:40.735
Forget what I said.

484
00:27:40.826 --> 00:27:42.532
You absolutely need advice.

485
00:27:42.619 --> 00:27:45.486
I know. dad. dad. dad.
Your advice. it was so helpful.

486
00:27:45.581 --> 00:27:46.891
- Don't do it!
- It really just. you know.

487
00:27:46.915 --> 00:27:48.155
sealed the deal for us.

488
00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:50.332
- Come home!
- I know. I'm so happy!

489
00:27:50.419 --> 00:27:51.829
- It's teriffic!
- No. she's not...

490
00:27:52.838 --> 00:27:54.419
Hey-o!

491
00:27:54.506 --> 00:27:55.962
Hi. how's it going?

492
00:27:56.049 --> 00:27:59.337
Blake. Blake! Hi. honey.
Congratulations!

493
00:27:59.428 --> 00:28:00.668
Congratulations. honey.

494
00:28:00.762 --> 00:28:02.282
Well. I can't wait
to be a part of the family.

495
00:28:02.306 --> 00:28:05.013
- Listen. you... I'm coming over!
- Okay.

496
00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:06.411
They're going to be
a married couple in no time.

497
00:28:06.435 --> 00:28:07.845
We'll put some champagne on ice.

498
00:28:10.397 --> 00:28:13.560
Hm. I think that went pretty well.

499
00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:15.732
I do. Yeah.
I think it went really well.

500
00:28:30.167 --> 00:28:33.910
Yeah!

501
00:28:42.679 --> 00:28:46.046
What's up. boo? What's up. boo?

502
00:28:53.023 --> 00:28:54.809
What's up. man?

503
00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.936
Hey. what's up. sweetie?

504
00:29:19.174 --> 00:29:20.414
Oh. yeah. yeah. yeah!

505
00:29:30.435 --> 00:29:31.766
- Blake.
- Hm?

506
00:29:31.853 --> 00:29:33.844
Blake. he's throwing
a fucking party out there.

507
00:29:33.939 --> 00:29:34.939
I'm calling the cops.

508
00:29:35.023 --> 00:29:37.480
Wait. wait. No. no. no. don't.
Don't call the cops.

509
00:29:37.567 --> 00:29:39.853
He's. like... he's a nice guy. He's fine.

510
00:29:39.945 --> 00:29:42.357
Well. are you gonna go
out there and deal with it then?

511
00:29:42.447 --> 00:29:45.405
Yes. Yes. I am.

512
00:29:46.952 --> 00:29:48.738
- And I'm gonna shut it down.
- Great.

513
00:29:48.829 --> 00:29:50.911
You go out there. shut it down.

514
00:29:50.998 --> 00:29:52.989
I'm taking an Ambien.
and I'm going to sleep.

515
00:29:53.083 --> 00:29:55.243
- I need to be up in four hours.
- Great. Great. great.

516
00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.586
Hey. Randy.
What the hell are you doing?

517
00:30:03.677 --> 00:30:05.822
- Oh. hey. Blake.
- You gotta shut this down. right now.

518
00:30:05.846 --> 00:30:07.198
No. no. not 'til you get a shish kabob.

519
00:30:07.222 --> 00:30:08.574
Hey. Benny. give him a shish kabob.

520
00:30:08.598 --> 00:30:09.867
- Try one.
- I don't want a shish kabob.

521
00:30:09.891 --> 00:30:12.203
- That's rude. dude.
- It's not rude. This is rude.

522
00:30:12.227 --> 00:30:13.842
- Whoa. whoa. whoa.

523
00:30:13.937 --> 00:30:15.373
Well. I gotta introduce you. Everybody.

524
00:30:15.397 --> 00:30:16.978
- No.
- Everybody listen up here. okay?

525
00:30:17.065 --> 00:30:18.896
This is Blake. This is his house.

526
00:30:18.984 --> 00:30:20.565
And I just want everybody to know.

527
00:30:20.652 --> 00:30:22.839
He's our friend.
He's our friend. He's our friend.

528
00:30:22.863 --> 00:30:24.694
Dudes. say it.

00:30:27.701 --> 00:30:30.534
All right. man.

531
00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:32.531
You gotta go. man. This is bad shit.

532
00:30:32.622 --> 00:30:34.600
I've already given everyone
the three-minute warning.

533
00:30:34.624 --> 00:30:36.080
- Right. you guys?
- Yeah!

534
00:30:36.168 --> 00:30:37.168
I don't care...

No. I don't know where you
can get a straw...

564
00:31:42.651 --> 00:31:44.767
- Why is it so bad?

565
00:32:00.877 --> 00:32:02.458

00:32:12.347 --> 00:32:14.338
Jj

567
00:33:17.037 --> 00:33:18.743
What's going on here?

568
00:33:19.748 --> 00:33:20.954
Oh. there we go. Right there.

569
00:33:21.041 --> 00:33:23.157
Hey. Hey. You the homeowner?

570
00:33:23.251 --> 00:33:25.146
No. no. no. I live in the guest house
in the back.

571
00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:27.064
- You throwing this party?
- No. no. no. I'm in the back.

572
00:33:27.088 --> 00:33:28.691
I'm in the guest house.
I'm actually moving out soon.

573
00:33:28.715 --> 00:33:29.715
Guest house?

574
00:33:29.799 --> 00:33:31.736
Yeah. I'm looking for a roommate.
if you know anyone.

575
00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.796
You know anyone off...?

576
00:33:33.887 --> 00:33:35.448
You know. it's funny you should say that.

577
00:33:35.472 --> 00:33:37.588
'Cause my uncle has this building
in the area. but...

578
00:33:37.682 --> 00:33:39.764
Holy shit. I gotta give you my number.

579
00:33:39.851 --> 00:33:42.183
- What do you think?
- Ah.

580
00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:45.137
Yo. let me get your beer.
A beer. Whiskey. beer.

581
00:33:47.442 --> 00:33:48.978
- Oh. god. I wish I could.
- Oh. man.

582
00:33:49.069 --> 00:33:50.171
I'm on duty. I can't be drinking on duty.

583
00:33:50.195 --> 00:33:52.777
Copy. copy. You...

584
00:33:52.864 --> 00:33:54.008
You know. I have to tell you something.

585
00:33:54.032 --> 00:33:56.569
You police officers
are very much underappreciated.

586
00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:59.743
I think you guys are fucking awesome.
I think you got a bad rap.

587
00:33:59.829 --> 00:34:01.410
- Sweet hug? Come in.
- Well...

588
00:34:01.498 --> 00:34:02.498
Come on.

589
00:34:02.541 --> 00:34:03.951
No one ever hugs police officers.

590
00:34:04.042 --> 00:34:05.077
That's true.

591
00:34:06.127 --> 00:34:08.709
Oh. this... that feels good.

592
00:34:10.048 --> 00:34:11.568
- You're so stupid. get off me.
- Yeah.

593
00:34:13.343 --> 00:34:14.403
- Stupid...
- That's fuckin'...

594
00:34:14.427 --> 00:34:17.419
I knew we were supposed to be together.
We're a team. man.

595
00:34:17.514 --> 00:34:20.051
What's your name? Officer Ford.

596
00:34:20.141 --> 00:34:21.472
- No.
- Officer Ford.

597
00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:22.891
Officer Ford. stop that.

598
00:34:22.978 --> 00:34:25.344

601
00:34:28.733 --> 00:34:30.269
- Randy cockfield?
- Yeah.

602
00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.255
'Cause when I'm in the field
I give the girls my what?

603
00:34:32.279 --> 00:34:34.144
- That... come on.
- You can say it.

604
00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:35.679
- No. I'm on duty.
- Come on. say it.

605
00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:36.855
Cock.

606
00:34:38.702 --> 00:34:41.034
- One more hug. one more hug!
- Ah. come on.

607
00:34:52.799 --> 00:34:54.130
Yeah. that's great.

608
00:34:56.845 --> 00:34:59.525
It's just not cool. I mean.
like. it's fun and stuff.

609
00:34:59.556 --> 00:35:00.796
I don't wanna leave.

610
00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:03.494
- You know. I wanna stay back there.
- I get it. It's a nice neighborhood.

611
00:35:03.518 --> 00:35:06.430
Yeah. and it's very comfortable.
so it's like I don't wanna move out.

612
00:35:06.521 --> 00:35:07.748
- You know what I mean?
- Hey. sir!

613
00:35:07.772 --> 00:35:08.772
Whoa.

614
00:35:08.815 --> 00:35:11.056
I need you to evacuate
the premises immediately.

615
00:35:11.151 --> 00:35:12.253
This party has been shut down.

616
00:35:12.277 --> 00:35:14.518
Oh. this is. uh...
This is actually my house.

617
00:35:14.613 --> 00:35:17.320
- Oh. Oh. this is your house?
- Yeah.

618
00:35:18.533 --> 00:35:20.069
Yeah.

619
00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:24.529
Welcome to the neighborhood. Mr. renner.
Now the folks around here

620
00:35:24.623 --> 00:35:28.286

and disturbing the peace...

621
00:35:28.376 --> 00:35:29.661
Not cool.

623
00:35:31.171 --> 00:35:32.752

624
00:35:32.839 --> 00:35:35.251
- Illegal. huh?

625
00:35:35.342 --> 00:35:36.673

626
00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.716
- All right.

627
00:35:38.803 --> 00:35:40.323
- Get him away from me.
- Why you smell so good?

628
00:35:40.347 --> 00:35:41.741

629
00:35:41.765 --> 00:35:44.046
- What kind of man smells this good?
- I shower regularly.

630
00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:45.202
What kinda man smells this good?!

Follow me on my social media
platforms. officer.

632

No way that call went in.
There's no way you talked...

636
00:35:55.403 --> 00:35:58.065
Literally and figuratively.
I got an asshole coming in.

637
00:35:59.658 --> 00:36:01.068
Please. pick up.

638
00:36:01.159 --> 00:36:02.990

Just let me know if you need anything.

641
00:36:21.429 --> 00:36:22.589

642
00:36:22.681 --> 00:36:24.592
Come with me. I'm gonna
show you to your room.

643
00:36:24.683 --> 00:36:26.423
Okay.

644
00:36:26.518 --> 00:36:28.383
He seems cool. He'll be cool.

645
00:36:28.478 --> 00:36:29.718
Oh. god!

646
00:36:33.483 --> 00:36:35.565
Be sure to call the front desk
if you need anything.

647
00:36:46.538 --> 00:36:48.529
Blake. what the hell
happened to our backyard?

648
00:36:48.623 --> 00:36:51.490
I don't know where you are.
but you're not here.

649
00:36:51.584 --> 00:36:53.729
I've got the girls coming over to try on
their dresses.

650
00:36:53.753 --> 00:36:57.245
and you know what?
I... I don't know. I don't...

651
00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:00.207
I don't know if I can go through
with this wedding anymore.

652
00:37:00.301 --> 00:37:02.917
I even knocked
on Randy's fucking door.

653
00:37:03.096 --> 00:37:05.007
Jj

654
00:37:06.391 --> 00:37:08.598
What happened? What is this?

655
00:37:08.685 --> 00:37:10.892
Somebody put dicks everywhere.

656
00:37:11.896 --> 00:37:16.856
Some asshole turned our entire property
into a bag of dicks.

657
00:37:19.696 --> 00:37:21.152
Blake...

658
00:37:22.574 --> 00:37:24.064
Where are you?

659
00:37:27.162 --> 00:37:29.153
Jj

660
00:37:35.837 --> 00:37:37.577
I don't even know where he is.

661
00:37:37.672 --> 00:37:40.459
What if he's. like.
dead in a ditch somewhere?

662
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:43.667
I don't know. maybe he got scared
and just left me.

663
00:37:43.762 --> 00:37:45.844
I'd call that a good fuckin' day.

664
00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:48.387
There's a shit ton of dicks
in your backyard.

665
00:37:48.475 --> 00:37:49.760
I'd say that's a bad omen.

666
00:37:49.851 --> 00:37:53.014
There aren't that many dicks.

667
00:37:53.104 --> 00:37:56.096
You can fix this. It's not that bad.

668
00:37:56.191 --> 00:37:58.807
Eh. it's a dick-splosion.

669
00:37:58.902 --> 00:38:00.517
I don't know. I always liked Blake.

670
00:38:00.612 --> 00:38:03.399
He's like one of those good guys.
He'll be back.

671
00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:05.902
Sometimes I feel like I'm pushing him.

672
00:38:05.992 --> 00:38:08.654
- and maybe this isn't...
- I'm just gonna call it how it is.

673
00:38:08.745 --> 00:38:10.701
You need to toss that boy out
like a used tampon.

674
00:38:10.789 --> 00:38:12.433
- Ew. what is wrong with you?
- Jesus. Taylor.

675
00:38:12.457 --> 00:38:14.948
I'm serious. You can do
so much better than him.

676
00:38:15.043 --> 00:38:19.753
- Blake is a fucking...
- Cocksucker. crusty. dumb motherfuck.

677
00:38:19.839 --> 00:38:20.839
Blake?!

678
00:38:20.882 --> 00:38:22.213
- L...
- Blake. are you okay?

679
00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:23.790
I'm fine.

680
00:38:23.885 --> 00:38:25.841
What do you mean. fine?
What does fine mean?

681
00:38:25.929 --> 00:38:27.948
- Where've you been?
- Get out here. you fucking piece of shit!

682
00:38:27.972 --> 00:38:30.075
Come out. come out. wherever you are.

683
00:38:30.099 --> 00:38:31.760
Warriors!

684
00:38:31.851 --> 00:38:33.245
- Huh?
- You got me fucking arrested!

685
00:38:33.269 --> 00:38:35.225
- No. you got you arrested.
- Arrested?

686
00:38:35.313 --> 00:38:36.849
- Yes.
- I'll explain in a second.

687
00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:39.585
If you think about it. Blake.
none of this shit is actually my fault.

688
00:38:39.609 --> 00:38:42.225
What are you talking about.
you fucking psycho?

689
00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.901
You burned down my gazebo!

690
00:38:43.988 --> 00:38:47.196
No. Look. you burned down
your gazebo. Okay. right. dick face?

691
00:38:47.283 --> 00:38:48.928
Blake. were you partying
with Randy last night?

692
00:38:48.952 --> 00:38:50.930
- Yes. he was getting fucking wasted.
- No. no. Shut the fuck up.

693
00:38:50.954 --> 00:38:53.195
- No. I was not. I was not.
- Really? Not shit.

694
00:38:53.289 --> 00:38:55.405
- Fuckin' loser zero.
- He's lying.

695
00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.520
- That's not true. I was not.
- Oh. really. it wasn't?

696
00:38:57.544 --> 00:39:00.502
I can honestly say I wasn't
fucking partying with you. Yeah.

697
00:39:00.588 --> 00:39:02.795
Oh. you're fucking done now.
dude. Look at that.

698
00:39:02.882 --> 00:39:05.339
Huh?

699
00:39:05.426 --> 00:39:08.042
I am the god of cock fire!

700
00:39:08.137 --> 00:39:11.379
Who's that? Who's that. Blake?
Jesus Christ! That's you.

701
00:39:11.474 --> 00:39:12.805
Oh. my fucking god.

702
00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:15.037
That's being shown out of context.

703
00:39:15.061 --> 00:39:16.789
How is it taken
out of context? Tell her.

704
00:39:16.813 --> 00:39:20.180
It's not like that. I...
I got a little drunk.

705
00:39:20.275 --> 00:39:22.891
Just stop. just stop. just stop talking.

706
00:39:22.986 --> 00:39:24.672
- Done. Done. done. done.
- I can't!

707
00:39:24.696 --> 00:39:26.136
I can't do this.

708
00:39:26.948 --> 00:39:29.948
It looks like you have a lot more to worry
about than me. motherfucker. huh?

709
00:39:29.993 --> 00:39:34.953
Princess Sarah is pi-i-i-issed.

710
00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:36.725
Which means you ain't gettin'
no pussy tonight.

711
00:39:36.749 --> 00:39:39.707
Shut the fuck up. all right?!
We just wanted a house!

712
00:39:39.794 --> 00:39:42.251
We went and looked at 17 houses.

713
00:39:42.338 --> 00:39:45.330
and we found this one.
and finally Sarah was happy.

714
00:39:45.425 --> 00:39:48.462
and so was I.
and then fucking you!

715
00:39:49.888 --> 00:39:52.800
Well. I guess...

716
00:39:52.891 --> 00:39:55.691
You're not my friend. you're not
my friend. you're not my friend. dude.

717
00:39:55.768 --> 00:39:57.224
Shut the fuck...

718
00:39:58.229 --> 00:40:00.220
Jj

719
00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.022
Oh. my god.

720
00:40:23.046 --> 00:40:25.128
Yeah. yeah. You know
what underage drinking

721
00:40:25.214 --> 00:40:28.547
and assault and battery
have in common. renner?

722
00:40:28.635 --> 00:40:29.966
They're both illegal.

723
00:40:30.053 --> 00:40:31.543
- That's right!
- Illegal!

724
00:40:31.638 --> 00:40:33.344
- Hey! Are you okay?
- Oh. my god.

725
00:40:33.431 --> 00:40:35.046
- No.
- I can't believe you hit Randy.

726
00:40:35.141 --> 00:40:36.426
L... he drugged me.

727
00:40:36.517 --> 00:40:38.132
You know what? Apologize to Randy.

728
00:40:38.227 --> 00:40:39.637
- Yeah.
- Apologize!

729
00:40:39.729 --> 00:40:41.040
- I will not apologize.
- Tell him to kiss me.

730
00:40:41.064 --> 00:40:42.144
Yeah. kiss Randy.

731
00:40:42.231 --> 00:40:44.062
Go ahead. go ahead! Go ahead!

732
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:46.482
- What the fuck?! You're gonna kiss him?
- I don't know!

733
00:40:46.569 --> 00:40:47.809
You're a piece of shit. man!

734
00:40:47.904 --> 00:40:49.423
He was gonna kiss me.
You're a piece of shit!

735
00:40:49.447 --> 00:40:52.610
I can't believe this. I'm back here again
with you trust fund kids.

736
00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:53.815
I'm not a trust fund kid.

737
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:57.118
Yeah. like you can afford this.
Just sit there and shut the fuck up.

738
00:40:57.205 --> 00:40:59.742
- Thank you.
- Oh. my god. I'm so sorry. Randy.

739
00:40:59.832 --> 00:41:02.289
- My head hurts.
- Did he hit you good?

740
00:41:02.377 --> 00:41:03.913
Yeah. he punched me under there.

741
00:41:04.003 --> 00:41:05.994
and I was on my dating app.
chubby chasers.

742
00:41:06.089 --> 00:41:08.009
I was looking for some babes.
and this fucking...

743
00:41:08.091 --> 00:41:10.582
- I'm on chubby chasers.
- No. really?

744
00:41:10.677 --> 00:41:12.338
- I love big bitches. man!
- Oh. my god!

745
00:41:14.847 --> 00:41:16.408
- Have you... have you met anybody?
- Can we go?

746
00:41:16.432 --> 00:41:17.797
- Hey! Hey!
- Yeah. yeah...

747
00:41:17.892 --> 00:41:20.304
Hey. I'm the captain now.

748
00:41:21.813 --> 00:41:24.099
We should watch that. Movie night.

749
00:41:25.108 --> 00:41:26.769
- All right. Randy.
- Thank you. officer.

750
00:41:26.859 --> 00:41:29.225
- This is war.
- Carl. take care.

751
00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:33.563
Shut your fucking face.

752
00:41:33.658 --> 00:41:34.898
- Okay?
- Right. Great. Yeah.

753
00:41:34.993 --> 00:41:36.529
Just sit back and shut up.

754
00:41:36.619 --> 00:41:39.031
I know your type! I fucking hate you!

755
00:41:40.248 --> 00:41:42.534
Dammit. I gotta take this motherfuckin'...

756
00:41:42.625 --> 00:41:44.311
- You're lucky I didn't get this out.
- Yeah.

757
00:41:44.335 --> 00:41:45.335
Beat your ass with this.

758
00:41:45.503 --> 00:41:47.223
Well. here's your belongings.

759
00:41:48.339 --> 00:41:51.376
I need you to sign...
Right here.

760
00:41:54.804 --> 00:41:57.921
- When can we expect to see you again?
- Never again.

761
00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:01.215
Fantastic.

762
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:02.800
We'll keep the same room for ya.

763
00:42:02.895 --> 00:42:04.635
I'll get you a good roommate.

764
00:42:05.648 --> 00:42:07.229
Really nice.

765
00:42:07.316 --> 00:42:08.556
Okay. all right. Terrific.

766
00:42:08.651 --> 00:42:10.858
Look. I'm really sorry
about all this dumb shit.

767
00:42:10.945 --> 00:42:13.061
Lying to you. partying. Randy.

768
00:42:13.156 --> 00:42:14.646
Look. Blake. it's not about Randy.

769
00:42:14.741 --> 00:42:17.052
It's about you and your behavior.
This really has gotta stop.

770
00:42:17.076 --> 00:42:19.112
Well. well. well.

771
00:42:19.203 --> 00:42:21.444
We meet again. Mr. renner.

772
00:42:23.082 --> 00:42:24.562
Look. I'm just getting out right now.

773
00:42:24.625 --> 00:42:26.865
- Good to see you again.
- So if you'll just let us go...

774
00:42:27.754 --> 00:42:30.917
I'm actually here to serve you
with a restraining order

775
00:42:31.007 --> 00:42:33.919
on behalf of one Mr. Randy cockfield.

776
00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:36.797
That's gotta be a mistake.
I mean. it's-it's our house.

777
00:42:36.888 --> 00:42:39.379
We-we paid for it. We don't even have
3 lease with him on it.

778
00:42:39.474 --> 00:42:43.763
Ma'am. I understand that. but this is
about Mr. renner's assault.

779
00:42:43.853 --> 00:42:46.515
his temper. his anger issues.

780
00:42:46.606 --> 00:42:48.767
I am... this has to be a joke.

781
00:42:48.858 --> 00:42:50.268
There's no joke here. okay?

782
00:42:50.359 --> 00:42:55.319
You are no longer allowed
to be within 100 feet of Mr. cockfield.

783
00:42:55.406 --> 00:42:59.524
You may not contact him verbally
or by the Internet.

784
00:42:59.619 --> 00:43:00.804
I mean. is there anything we can do?

785
00:43:00.828 --> 00:43:04.446
You can contact the city. but the laws
for tenants are pretty strict.

786
00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:06.826
He's not a tenant! He's a squatter!

787
00:43:06.918 --> 00:43:10.081
How am I supposed to keep
100 feet away from him in my own house?

788
00:43:10.171 --> 00:43:12.036
Good luck. bye.

789
00:43:12.131 --> 00:43:13.211
Good bye.

790
00:43:13.299 --> 00:43:15.005
- Sergeant.
- Good bye.

791
00:43:15.093 --> 00:43:19.257
- Why is everyone here like this?
- Don't. don't. don't. You're fucked.

792
00:43:34.278 --> 00:43:36.485
It is so on. you bitch!

793
00:43:36.572 --> 00:43:41.032
Mm... Blake. I thought
you were my friend. but I guess not.

794
00:43:41.119 --> 00:43:42.279
What did you say?

795
00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:46.659
I said you...
Have skinny bony bitches.

796
00:43:46.749 --> 00:43:47.955
That's it. That's all from me.

797
00:43:48.042 --> 00:43:49.748
I just want to stand and stare tonight.

798
00:43:49.836 --> 00:43:52.418
- Go back inside you little...
- I interrupted the whole flow.

799
00:43:52.505 --> 00:43:54.962
I can't believe I let you
come here and suck my dick pipe.

800
00:43:55.049 --> 00:43:58.962
That dick pipe is a gross exaggeration
of what you're working with. my man.

801
00:43:59.053 --> 00:44:02.420
Yeah. what the fuck ever.
you little waspy bitch.

802
00:44:03.558 --> 00:44:06.265
You stay on your side.
and I'll stay on my side.

803
00:44:06.352 --> 00:44:09.435
Warriors. come out and play.

804
00:44:09.522 --> 00:44:11.979
They're all my side.

805
00:44:12.066 --> 00:44:13.647
- Good night.
- Good night.

806
00:44:13.734 --> 00:44:15.065
Go back to marin county.

807
00:44:18.281 --> 00:44:20.272
Jj

808
00:44:29.959 --> 00:44:32.621
No. I'm kicking him out. This is war.

809
00:44:32.712 --> 00:44:35.078
Don't start this.
I can't handle the stress.

810
00:44:35.173 --> 00:44:37.334
What. and let him walk all over us?
No fuckin' way!

811
00:44:37.425 --> 00:44:38.944
I'm serious.
I don't like this side of you.

812
00:44:38.968 --> 00:44:41.004
Well. you haven't seen
anything yet.

813
00:44:41.095 --> 00:44:42.960
- Thank you very much.
- What are you doing?

814
00:44:49.478 --> 00:44:51.343
Dance with me. dude!

815
00:44:51.439 --> 00:44:55.102
Dance with me. dude!
You're my friend. dude.

816
00:45:00.323 --> 00:45:04.066
Benny. dude! Dance with me. dude!

817
00:45:05.244 --> 00:45:06.700
- Randy.
- What?

818
00:45:06.787 --> 00:45:09.016
- I think I'm gonna go. dude.
- No. no. no. just stay. Stay.

819
00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:12.783
- Yo. can I put my clothes back on?
- No. no. no. Keep your clothes off.

820
00:45:12.877 --> 00:45:14.617
Just... and read the book.

821
00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:18.871
This book's in Latin. bro.
I can't read Latin.

822
00:45:21.135 --> 00:45:23.877
- Are you happy?
- No. No.

823
00:45:23.971 --> 00:45:25.962
Oh. shit.

824
00:45:29.352 --> 00:45:30.996
- What the fuck happened?
- He'll be gone in a few days.

825
00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:33.165
- What's he gonna do without power?
- Why did the power go off?

826
00:45:33.189 --> 00:45:34.725
I don't like this.

827
00:45:34.815 --> 00:45:36.055
Come on. What?

828
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:38.061
No one says I have to pay
for his electricity.

829
00:45:39.153 --> 00:45:40.984
He's fucked.

830
00:45:53.042 --> 00:45:55.283
What the fuck is that?

831
00:45:55.378 --> 00:45:57.744
It sounds like a helicopter's out there.

832
00:46:02.927 --> 00:46:05.384
Cutting off the power's

00:46:09.642 --> 00:46:11.257
Too motherfucking strong.

Look at that shit.

837
00:46:14.397 --> 00:46:16.353
This is my side. that's your side.

838
00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.556
You stay over there. little pussy.

839
00:46:18.651 --> 00:46:20.141
Who's got some beer. huh?

840
00:46:26.867 --> 00:46:31.736
Hey. Benny! Randy can wobble.

00:46:31.831 --> 00:46:35.289

Looks like all we got left is
the interview. and then the launch party.

848
00:47:58.918 --> 00:48:00.687
and we should be...
We should be squared away.

849
00:48:00.711 --> 00:48:02.997
- Are you okay. blakey?
- Yeah. I'm good. I'm great.

850
00:48:03.089 --> 00:48:05.125
- You sweating like a fuckin' pig. homes.
- Mm...

851
00:48:06.133 --> 00:48:08.044
Did you jog to work today or something?

852
00:48:08.135 --> 00:48:09.215
No. Regular day.

853
00:48:09.303 --> 00:48:11.544
Holy shit!

854
00:48:11.639 --> 00:48:13.630

That's hot.

857
00:48:41.377 --> 00:48:42.937
Someone's looking all hot and bothered.

858
00:48:58.436 --> 00:48:59.436
Hello.

859
00:49:01.647 --> 00:49:05.185
Oh... oh. hi. Hi. ma'am.

860
00:49:05.276 --> 00:49:07.767
- You got a package for me?
- Yes.

861
00:49:07.862 --> 00:49:09.352
It's a package. That's my job.

862
00:49:09.447 --> 00:49:10.937
You don't wanna
deliver your package?

863
00:49:11.031 --> 00:49:12.987
Oh. my god! This is...
Is this really happening?

864
00:49:13.075 --> 00:49:17.489
Wait. is this really happening?
This is really happening!

865
00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:20.242
Yay!

866
00:49:20.332 --> 00:49:24.120
Yay! Yay!

867
00:49:24.211 --> 00:49:26.418
What do I do? What do I do?

868
00:49:26.505 --> 00:49:27.790
- Yeah.
- There we go.

869
00:49:27.882 --> 00:49:29.622
I think this...
Can we do it this way?

870
00:49:29.717 --> 00:49:30.752
Does this work?

871
00:49:30.843 --> 00:49:34.256
That feels good.
That's good for my back.

872
00:49:34.346 --> 00:49:37.179
All right. that's good.
I gotta go back to work.

873
00:49:37.266 --> 00:49:39.382
- Yeah!
- To deliver some packages.

874
00:49:39.477 --> 00:49:40.967
Please. get the fuck off me!

Yeah. you do.

877
00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:46.601
Here's the fun Blake I know.

878
00:49:46.692 --> 00:49:49.024
Oh. yeah. Oh. my god.
what is this material?

879
00:49:49.111 --> 00:49:51.602
It's like rayon. or some poly-cotton
or something?

880
00:49:51.697 --> 00:49:54.609
It's amazing. I wish the whole world
was this fabric.

881
00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:56.486
Wait. are you on Molly or something?

882
00:49:56.577 --> 00:49:59.319
Molly? No. no. no. I would never
even be able to get my...

883
00:49:59.413 --> 00:50:00.573
Oh. my god.

884
00:50:00.664 --> 00:50:02.267
- I'm so... no. this is bad.
- Wait. What?

885
00:50:02.291 --> 00:50:05.187
I... this is great. You're great. you're
so great. but I have to go. I'm on drugs.

886
00:50:05.211 --> 00:50:06.271
- Blake.
- No. no. I'm on drugs.

887
00:50:06.295 --> 00:50:07.455
I'm sorry. Sorry. sorry.

888
00:50:07.546 --> 00:50:10.162
- Hello?
- Sarah. we've been drugged.

889
00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:13.757
- What?
- I think that asshole...

890
00:50:13.844 --> 00:50:16.961
Never mind. just don't go out of the house
and don't drink the water.

891
00:50:17.056 --> 00:50:19.047
Just go to the bedroom.
I'll be right there.

892
00:50:19.141 --> 00:50:21.723
Yeah. yeah. Okay. Okay.

893
00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:24.552
- What's the matter?
- You gotta... you gotta... you gotta go.

894
00:50:24.647 --> 00:50:26.458
- Is that family?
- You gotta go. No. you gotta go.

895
00:50:26.482 --> 00:50:28.293
- Is there a family problem?
- Uh-uh. you gotta go.

896
00:50:28.317 --> 00:50:30.273
- No. no... I don't...
- You gotta go. come on.

897
00:50:30.361 --> 00:50:32.192
- No. I don't wanna go.
- You gotta go.

898
00:50:32.279 --> 00:50:34.007
- I don't wanna go!
- You gotta go!

899
00:50:34.031 --> 00:50:35.031
Oh. my god!

900
00:50:35.115 --> 00:50:37.106
Jj

901
00:50:54.927 --> 00:50:56.007
Yes!

902
00:51:15.614 --> 00:51:18.105
- Blake... Blake?
- Hm?

903
00:51:20.244 --> 00:51:24.032
- What the actual fuck?
- Whoa. I'm late for work.

904
00:51:24.123 --> 00:51:25.238
I'm late for work.

905
00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:29.916
- Hi.
- Sorry.

906
00:51:37.845 --> 00:51:40.712
Whoa! Hey. hi.
I was just checking over...

907
00:51:40.806 --> 00:51:42.421
- Blake. you got a minute?
- Yeah. yeah.

908
00:51:42.516 --> 00:51:43.952
I got a... yeah. yeah. I got a minute.

909
00:51:43.976 --> 00:51:46.456
We've known each other a while. right?
You consider us friends?

910
00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:48.181
Yeah. Yeah. you and me. we're friends.

911
00:51:48.272 --> 00:51:51.059
And friends can be honest with each other?

912
00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:54.108
Yeah. Honesty is the bedrock...

913
00:51:54.194 --> 00:51:56.150
Can I tell you something honestly?

914
00:51:56.238 --> 00:51:59.856
- Yeah. please.
- You are fucking fired.

915
00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:04.780
What happened?

916
00:52:04.872 --> 00:52:07.363
That walking foreskin got me fired.

917
00:52:07.458 --> 00:52:10.450
No. no. no. no. wait. wait. wait.
Do not hit him again.

918
00:52:10.544 --> 00:52:12.147
I'm not gonna hit him.
I'm not even gonna touch him.

919
00:52:12.171 --> 00:52:14.958
I'm just gonna lightly.
lightly pummel him until he's dead.

920
00:52:15.049 --> 00:52:18.291
No. no. no. wait. wait. wait.
Listen to me. listen to me. okay?

921
00:52:18.385 --> 00:52:19.821
It's not worth it.
We talked about this.

922
00:52:19.845 --> 00:52:21.381
You were gonna leave your job anyways.

923
00:52:21.472 --> 00:52:23.617
so. you know. I can float us
until you find something else.

924
00:52:23.641 --> 00:52:25.927
- That's not the point.
- It's not worth it. Let it go.

925
00:52:26.018 --> 00:52:27.428
We'll get through this. okay?

926
00:52:27.519 --> 00:52:29.331
The wedding party's coming
tomorrow night for dinner.

927
00:52:29.355 --> 00:52:31.249
and I do not need this crazy
on top of all the other crazy.

928
00:52:31.273 --> 00:52:33.264
I cannot let him get away with this.

929
00:52:33.359 --> 00:52:35.850
Wait. wait. wait. wait. just listen to me.
Hey. hey. hey. hey.

930
00:52:35.944 --> 00:52:37.584
Take a deep breath.
Take a deep breath in.

931
00:52:40.032 --> 00:52:41.897
Let it go. just relax. babe.

932
00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:45.151
He's not worth it.
He's not worth it. okay?

933
00:52:46.246 --> 00:52:47.702
What if. um...

934
00:52:47.790 --> 00:52:50.873
What if we go take
a really nice deep bath. and soak.

935
00:52:50.959 --> 00:52:53.701
and I'll get some epsom salts.
and we can just talk it out. Yeah?

936
00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:56.620
Okay. That'd be great.

937
00:52:56.715 --> 00:52:58.671
- Yeah? Okay.
- Mm-hmm. That'd be really great.

938
00:52:58.759 --> 00:53:00.374
- Thank you.
- Okay.

939
00:53:08.769 --> 00:53:12.102
No job is actually an advantage.

940
00:53:12.189 --> 00:53:14.555
It means you have
all the time in the world.

941
00:53:14.650 --> 00:53:16.060
Well. now...

942
00:53:17.986 --> 00:53:19.442
Me too. motherfucker.

943
00:53:27.913 --> 00:53:29.904
Jj

944
00:54:03.991 --> 00:54:05.902
You motherfucker!

945
00:54:05.993 --> 00:54:07.403
Hey. Randy!

946
00:54:07.494 --> 00:54:09.906
Buddy! Oh. my god.
I totally forgot to tell you!

947
00:54:09.997 --> 00:54:11.828
They're bug-bombing the house today.

948
00:54:11.915 --> 00:54:16.158
Randy has fallen.
and he can't get up.

949
00:54:16.253 --> 00:54:19.040
Yeah. man. shit's just. uh.
been so crazy with the wedding.

950
00:54:19.131 --> 00:54:20.621
I totally forgot you were in there.

951
00:54:20.716 --> 00:54:22.047
You're an asshole.

952
00:54:23.427 --> 00:54:26.635
You should know they're using
very heavy duty chemicals.

953
00:54:26.722 --> 00:54:29.429
Apparently. all your bodily functions
will go off at once.

954
00:54:29.516 --> 00:54:31.222
Huh? Oh. no.

955
00:54:31.310 --> 00:54:33.517
Oh! Oh. no.

956
00:54:36.482 --> 00:54:38.598
I dookied!

957
00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:46.818
Just repeat after me:

958
00:54:46.909 --> 00:54:49.867
- It's not gay.
- It's not gay.

959
00:54:49.953 --> 00:54:51.443
It's not gay!

960
00:54:51.538 --> 00:54:52.903
Again. even more.

961
00:54:53.916 --> 00:54:57.079
- It's not gay.
- It's okay. Randy. it's okay.

962
00:54:57.169 --> 00:54:58.909
It's a trust exercise.

963
00:54:59.004 --> 00:55:02.371
Just close your eyes
and trust me. dude.

964
00:55:08.055 --> 00:55:10.341
Piece of shit.
I'm gonna get you. renner.

965
00:55:20.734 --> 00:55:22.725
Jj

966
00:55:46.218 --> 00:55:48.129
Blake. why is there a meth lab
in our backyard?

967
00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:51.587
I'm going in there
to get all that pack rat's shit.

968
00:55:51.682 --> 00:55:55.174
and I'm gonna move it. so that he has
to take his rathole elsewhere.

969
00:55:55.269 --> 00:55:56.930
Oh.

970
00:55:57.020 --> 00:56:00.353
Now. we can have
the rehearsal dinner back here.

971
00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:04.058
I'll fix up the gazebo.
and we can have the wedding back here!

972
00:56:04.152 --> 00:56:06.609
All while that fucker's
not around to mess with us!

973
00:56:06.697 --> 00:56:09.029
Oh!

974
00:56:10.325 --> 00:56:12.236
I'm gonna have my gravy.

975
00:56:13.495 --> 00:56:16.032
- I love you!
- I love you. too!

976
00:56:16.123 --> 00:56:18.205
I honestly love you so much.

977
00:56:27.384 --> 00:56:29.591
Jj

978
00:56:44.109 --> 00:56:45.169
- Oh. yeah.
- Yeah. okay.

979
00:56:45.193 --> 00:56:46.899
Now's the time.

980
00:56:46.987 --> 00:56:50.445
Um... so before we dig into dessert. um.

981
00:56:50.532 --> 00:56:54.525
we just wanted to say a big thank you
to our amazing wedding party.

982
00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:57.487
- All you guys.
- All your love and support.

983
00:56:57.581 --> 00:57:01.540
Um. the last couple weeks have been a bit
of a journey getting here. but...

984
00:57:01.627 --> 00:57:04.289
It's been a little rocky.
but it's been good.

985
00:57:04.379 --> 00:57:05.664
Yeah.

986
00:57:06.965 --> 00:57:08.171
- Yeah.
- Um...

987
00:57:08.258 --> 00:57:12.718
But tonight is really just about
celebrating and making memories

988
00:57:12.804 --> 00:57:14.635
and. um. spreading love.

989
00:57:16.224 --> 00:57:17.805
Aww. - cheers.

990
00:57:17.893 --> 00:57:21.351
- Cheers. you guys. Thank you so much.
- Cheers.

991
00:57:23.315 --> 00:57:25.681
Enjoy the cake.

992
00:57:27.819 --> 00:57:29.855
- Mm...
- Weddings are the worst.

993
00:57:29.947 --> 00:57:32.154
I'm sure your wedding's
gonna be fine. but...

994
00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:33.400
I hate weddings.

995
00:57:33.492 --> 00:57:35.528
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm gonna go to yours. renner. but...

996
00:57:35.619 --> 00:57:37.359
- It'll be all right.
- I appreciate that.

997
00:57:37.454 --> 00:57:39.820
I appreciate...
Mainly. it's her dad. uh...

998
00:57:39.915 --> 00:57:42.372
What's the word? He hates me.
He hates me a ton.

999
00:57:42.459 --> 00:57:45.872
Okay. Blake's exaggerating.
He doesn't hate you. he just...

1000
00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:49.496
He's... not too sure about you.

1001
00:57:49.591 --> 00:57:52.958
Oh. come on. Who could hate
those sad goat eyes?

1002
00:57:53.053 --> 00:57:54.714
Sarah's dad isn't so bad.

1003
00:57:54.805 --> 00:57:56.045
Loved me. right. Sarah?

1004
00:57:56.139 --> 00:57:58.755
Kip. he-he-he did.

1005
00:57:58.850 --> 00:58:00.465
Yeah. he really loves you a ton.

1006
00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:02.425
Good old Douglas. man.

1007
00:58:02.521 --> 00:58:04.432
He's crazy. I love that dude.

1008
00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:06.793
Remember when he took us
to the beach house?

1009
00:58:06.817 --> 00:58:09.149
Oh. the beach house!
Dude. that was so dope!

1010
00:58:09.236 --> 00:58:11.443
Oh. man.

1011
00:58:11.530 --> 00:58:13.174
That sounds awesome.
That sounds really awesome.

1012
00:58:13.198 --> 00:58:14.313
- Absolutely.
- Beach house.

1013
00:58:14.408 --> 00:58:16.490
I've seen pictures. but I've never been.

1014
00:58:16.576 --> 00:58:17.782
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1015
00:58:17.869 --> 00:58:22.112
The very second he met me. he called me
kip. then he said. "never mind."

1016
00:58:22.207 --> 00:58:23.309
And then he said. "I hate you."

1017
00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:27.042
Here we motherfuckin' go.

1018
00:58:30.632 --> 00:58:32.748
Fuckin' flakka possum.

1019
00:58:38.056 --> 00:58:40.047
Jj

1020
00:59:36.948 --> 00:59:38.904
Well. that's the last of the shots.

1021
00:59:38.992 --> 00:59:40.983
With any luck.
you guys will all be fine.

1022
00:59:42.537 --> 00:59:44.698
Except him.
He's not going anywhere.

1023
00:59:44.790 --> 00:59:46.496
Ah. man. that's bullshit.

1024
00:59:46.583 --> 00:59:47.618
Mm. it is.

1025
00:59:47.709 --> 00:59:50.189
You know. you did the right thing
coming in as fast as you did.

1026
00:59:50.253 --> 00:59:51.993
Rabies is not something
to be taken lightly.

1027
00:59:52.089 --> 00:59:52.919
Mm-hmm.

1028
00:59:53.006 --> 00:59:55.247
May I ask you
a fairly serious question?

1029
00:59:55.342 --> 00:59:58.209
- Of course.
- What the fuck was that thing?

1030
00:59:58.303 --> 01:00:00.510
- Goddamn. you guys got fucked up.
- I'm sorry. wait.

1031
01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:02.713
Did you say we have
a decent chance of being okay?

1032
01:00:02.808 --> 01:00:05.470
- It's not... it's not a good chance?
- The medicine usually works.

1033
01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.141
What do you mean. usually?

1034
01:00:07.229 --> 01:00:09.265
What-what if the medicine
doesn't-doesn't work?

1035
01:00:09.356 --> 01:00:11.847
Well. then you're fucked... basically.

1036
01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:15.687
Fucking flakka possum.

1037
01:00:15.779 --> 01:00:18.236
Everybody else
got the rabies shots already.

1038
01:00:18.323 --> 01:00:20.609
Do you think we should tell them
that it may not work?

1039
01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:22.361
Maybe keep it from them for a little bit.

1040
01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:24.283
- Um...
- Oh.

1041
01:00:24.371 --> 01:00:29.661
Mr. renner. um. what exactly
did this to your guests?

1042
01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:31.742
Nothing. I have no idea.

1043
01:00:31.837 --> 01:00:34.328
It could've been absolutely anything.

1044
01:00:34.422 --> 01:00:39.633
Yeah. Mr. renner. I'd advise you
not to take the law into your own hands.

1045
01:00:39.719 --> 01:00:42.210
Of course not.
Because that would be illegal.

1046
01:00:43.223 --> 01:00:44.713
Very illegal.

1047
01:00:45.725 --> 01:00:49.468
Okay. Bonnie and Clyde.
you have a good evening.

1048
01:00:49.563 --> 01:00:52.305
Will do. Thank you so much
for stopping by.

1049
01:00:52.399 --> 01:00:55.891
- It's so good to see you.
- Oh. I hate you both.

1050
01:00:57.988 --> 01:00:59.465
I think we got to postpone the wedding.

1051
01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:01.025
No. what? No. no. no. no.

1052
01:01:01.116 --> 01:01:02.885
He knows that he went too far
with all of this shit.

1053
01:01:02.909 --> 01:01:05.116
Now he'll lie low.
he'll be too scared to do anything.

1054
01:01:05.203 --> 01:01:06.363
The wedding is still on.

1055
01:01:06.454 --> 01:01:09.116
- Il mean...
- The wedding is still on.

1056
01:01:09.207 --> 01:01:10.447
It's... it's a 100 percent on.

1057
01:01:10.542 --> 01:01:13.204
- Are you sure?
- Yes. I'm sure.

1058
01:01:13.295 --> 01:01:16.162
- I love you.
- I love you.

1059
01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:30.183
- I think he's gonna die.
- I know.

1060
01:01:59.424 --> 01:02:00.539
Daddy...

1061
01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:05.877
I will give you $100.000
if we turn around right now.

1062
01:02:05.972 --> 01:02:07.692
- We already talked about this.
- All right.

1063
01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:09.843
Hi.

1064
01:02:10.852 --> 01:02:12.513
Hi. Good to see you.

1065
01:02:12.604 --> 01:02:13.844
Dearly beloved...

1066
01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:16.346
We are gathered here today

1067
01:02:17.359 --> 01:02:19.020
in the presence of god.

1068
01:02:20.111 --> 01:02:24.275
to join this man and this woman
in holy matrimony.

1069
01:02:25.492 --> 01:02:29.986
To bind their hearts as one
for ever and ever...

1070
01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.947
And ever. Ever...

1071
01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:36.229
- Do you have a mint?
- To find their love...

1072
01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:37.730
- What's that. sir?
- A mint. Do you have...

1073
01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:39.494
You don't have to call me "sir."

1074
01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:41.580
- Love is kind...
- I can't get you...

1075
01:02:41.675 --> 01:02:44.337
I wish you were calling me "dad."

1076
01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:46.759
Walk away.

1077
01:02:46.846 --> 01:02:49.337
Walk away right now.
End this shit. it's...

1078
01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:52.265
End this fucking madness.
You don't need this.

1079
01:02:52.352 --> 01:02:55.310
- Just end this.
- Dude. seriously?

1080
01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.622
- Blake!
- Jeez!

1081
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:19.873
- Do you take Sariah...â?
- Sarah.

1082
01:03:19.963 --> 01:03:22.295
- It's Sarah.
- Whatever.

1083
01:03:22.382 --> 01:03:25.294
- Mm-hmm.
- As your life... wife?

1084
01:03:25.385 --> 01:03:27.967
Yes. I do.

1085
01:03:28.054 --> 01:03:32.263
- Do you take... blame?
- Blake.

1086
01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:34.215
- Yeah.
- It's Blake.

1087
01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:36.848
Do you take this guy
to be your husband?

1088
01:03:36.938 --> 01:03:38.894
Yes. I do.

1089
01:03:38.982 --> 01:03:42.315
And now. by the power
invested in this state.

1090
01:03:42.402 --> 01:03:44.438
and this country.

1091
01:03:44.529 --> 01:03:47.646
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1092
01:03:47.741 --> 01:03:51.484
You may kiss the bride.
Or whatever.

1093
01:03:51.578 --> 01:03:53.159
Good luck.

1094
01:03:53.246 --> 01:03:55.737
May god have mercy
on your souls!

1095
01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:58.741
Jj

1096
01:04:32.077 --> 01:04:33.533
Well. man. you finally did it.

1097
01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:35.056
- I'm proud of you.
- Thank you.

1098
01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:36.411
Took one for the team.

1099
01:04:36.498 --> 01:04:38.363
Your life is completely over.

1100
01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:41.165
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you so much.

1101
01:04:41.252 --> 01:04:43.981
Listen. if there was ever a chance
that you're going to get anal. my friend.

1102
01:04:44.005 --> 01:04:45.290
it's tonight.

1103
01:04:45.382 --> 01:04:47.839
- We'll see. yeah.
- What's up. Mr. m?

1104
01:04:47.926 --> 01:04:49.666
How's it going?
Looking good. buddy.

1105
01:04:49.761 --> 01:04:52.093
- Jason statham good.
- Stop talking.

1106
01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:53.545
Get out of my air space.

1107
01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:55.972
- Let's go.
- Unreal.

1108
01:04:57.143 --> 01:04:59.680
- Blake.
- Mr. masters.

1109
01:04:59.771 --> 01:05:01.261
Or I guess I should say dad.

1110
01:05:01.356 --> 01:05:05.224
How... you have surprised me.

1111
01:05:06.236 --> 01:05:08.648
And those who have tried will tell you

1112
01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:11.104
it is not an easy thing to surprise me.

1113
01:05:12.992 --> 01:05:15.074
J-Jesus!

1114
01:05:15.161 --> 01:05:17.948
Angela. you should know better
than to ever sneak up!

1115
01:05:18.039 --> 01:05:21.782
Never sneak up on a man.
me especially.

1116
01:05:23.086 --> 01:05:25.998
- Whoo...
- She's a wonderful woman.

1117
01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:28.421
I knew her since... she was...

1118
01:05:28.508 --> 01:05:32.126
She's always been that tall.
and she makes great honey-baked ham.

1119
01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:35.178
Blake... oh. god.

1120
01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:38.598
Here's the deal. no one's done it.

1121
01:05:38.685 --> 01:05:40.801
You brought my daughter to the altar.

1122
01:05:40.895 --> 01:05:44.183
Yeah. Look. I want you to know.
Sarah is my whole world.

1123
01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:45.309
- Uh-huh.
- All right.

1124
01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:48.938
I... I know she's too good for me.
I do. No. I really do.

1125
01:05:49.028 --> 01:05:52.771
But her happiness is the most important
thing in the world to me.

1126
01:05:54.701 --> 01:05:56.407
Well. that's one thing we have in common.

1127
01:05:58.079 --> 01:05:58.943
Daddy.

1128
01:05:59.038 --> 01:06:00.323
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1129
01:06:00.415 --> 01:06:03.532
Um... Blake. we just. uh...

1130
01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:05.582
We need you for some photos.

1131
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:07.331
I'll be there in a sec.

1132
01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:10.834
Mr. d.

1133
01:06:10.925 --> 01:06:13.337
Kip! Kip!

1134
01:06:24.439 --> 01:06:26.805
Ladies and gentlemen...

1135
01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:31.769
Would you join me. please.
in raising a glass

1136
01:06:31.863 --> 01:06:36.823
to my lovely daughter
and her new lovely husband.

1137
01:06:38.453 --> 01:06:39.659
- Sweet...
- Aww...

1138
01:06:39.746 --> 01:06:42.829
Sweet pea. my heart.

1139
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.834
I wish you the... the kind of passion

1140
01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:51.209
that your mother and I have shared
for the last 35 years.

1141
01:06:51.299 --> 01:06:53.039
Stop...

1142
01:06:54.844 --> 01:07:00.464
Not a day goes by that I do not
look across the room and...

1143
01:07:00.558 --> 01:07:03.516
And wonder how...
How am I so lucky?

1144
01:07:04.604 --> 01:07:06.435
Things I've done.

1145
01:07:06.523 --> 01:07:07.933
I tell you. though it sounds fun.

1146
01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:10.891
Waterboarding? Not a water sport.

1147
01:07:13.488 --> 01:07:16.730
But this lady...
Makes everything okay.

1148
01:07:17.742 --> 01:07:18.782
'Cause she's so beautiful.

1149
01:07:20.328 --> 01:07:21.443
So classy.

1150
01:07:22.497 --> 01:07:24.533
So attentive.

1151
01:07:24.624 --> 01:07:28.208
And so hungry...

1152
01:07:28.294 --> 01:07:29.730
What are you do... bev. what are you...?

1153
01:07:29.754 --> 01:07:31.119
Raise your glass!

1154
01:07:31.214 --> 01:07:32.954
Your tux is fantastic.

1155
01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:35.040
Hey. Douglas.
what's bev been drinkin'?

1156
01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:37.508
- I'll have a double.
- Oh!

1157
01:07:37.595 --> 01:07:39.615
I'll pour it for you a little bit later.

1158
01:07:39.639 --> 01:07:41.784
- You wanna... you wanna go lie down?
- He's cute.

1159
01:07:41.808 --> 01:07:43.719
- You okay?
- I wanna suck your cock.

1160
01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:46.677
Everybody. I wanna suck his cock!

1161
01:07:46.771 --> 01:07:48.978
Raise your glasses. everyone.

1162
01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:51.181
- That's...
- To sucking cock!

1163
01:07:54.612 --> 01:07:57.103
What the actual fuck?

1164
01:07:57.198 --> 01:07:59.093
I think your mom's on Molly.
That's what the actual fuck.

1165
01:07:59.117 --> 01:08:01.470
- This is really nice. What is this?
- What the hell's wrong with you?

1166
01:08:01.494 --> 01:08:02.529
- It's soft.
- Stop. stop.

1167
01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:03.860
- Ooh!
- Get out of here.

1168
01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:11.000
Blake. all of our guests
are acting really weird.

1169
01:08:11.087 --> 01:08:12.247
Yeah. right there.

1170
01:08:12.338 --> 01:08:14.704
Ah. no. they're just drunk.
It's a wedding.

1171
01:08:16.467 --> 01:08:19.174

What the fuck did you do. Randy?

1192
01:09:58.236 --> 01:10:00.318
I gave your party the whole box. brother.

01:11:24.197 --> 01:11:25.812
It'll be fine.

1199
01:11:25.907 --> 01:11:27.488
It's all over now.

1200
01:11:28.493 --> 01:11:30.108
Nearly over.

1201
01:11:32.497 --> 01:11:33.987
All right. look out.

1202
01:11:34.999 --> 01:11:36.409

Man...

1204
01:11:41.214 --> 01:11:42.920
If that shit was on pay-per-view.

1205
01:11:43.007 --> 01:11:45.007

right now. for real...

1206

Shut the fuck up!
You never shut the fuck up!

1207
01:11:49.222 --> 01:11:50.883
I was trying to be your friend.

1208
01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:53.430
Okay. I was being nice to you.
and being generous.

1209
01:11:53.518 --> 01:11:54.883
And you were miserable.

1210
01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:56.592
Oh. my god!
Of course. I was miserable!

1211
01:11:56.687 --> 01:11:59.645
All right? That's what growing up is.
You're just... you're miserable.

1212
01:11:59.732 --> 01:12:03.566
And you look for someone
you can try to enjoy the misery with.

1213
01:12:03.653 --> 01:12:05.894
And that's what Sarah is. Okay?

1214
01:12:05.988 --> 01:12:08.775
And then I fucked it
all up for no reason.

1215
01:12:08.866 --> 01:12:11.733
For you! For fucking around with you!
It's insane!

1216
01:12:11.828 --> 01:12:13.548
Yeah. well.
the Sarah thing will pass. okay?

1217
01:12:13.621 --> 01:12:16.328
I'm more concerned about us
and our relationship. okay?

1218
01:12:16.415 --> 01:12:19.122
So what we need to do as a...
As a team. bro. as a team...

1219
01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:20.495
Do not fucking touch me!

1220
01:12:20.586 --> 01:12:22.306
- We need to move forward.
- Don't touch me!

1221
01:12:22.338 --> 01:12:24.316
- We should move forward...
- There is no moving forward!

1222
01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:26.193
- And not look in the rearview...
- There's not a rearview mirror!

1223
01:12:26.217 --> 01:12:27.903
- Yes. there is.
- There's not a fucking rearview mirror!

1224
01:12:27.927 --> 01:12:29.363

1225
01:12:29.387 --> 01:12:30.739
- You're a loser. dude.
- What the fuck. dude.

1226
01:12:30.763 --> 01:12:32.991
You're 50 years old and you live
in a fucking guest house.

1227
01:12:33.015 --> 01:12:35.973
- Whatever. Dude...
- You are fucking delusional. man.

1228
01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:38.722
Everything around you turns to shit.

1229
01:12:41.148 --> 01:12:43.764
Mr. renner. Visitor.

1230
01:12:44.777 --> 01:12:45.983

Just stop. I... I came to pay your bail.

1233
01:12:52.827 --> 01:12:55.159
- Okay.
- What about my bail? Please.

1234
01:12:55.246 --> 01:12:57.578
No. I'm not paying your fucking bail.

1235
01:12:57.665 --> 01:13:01.374
I-I came to pay your bail. I paid
your bail. and that's... that's it.

1236
01:13:02.378 --> 01:13:05.586
- Wh-what do you mean?
- I mean... I mean. that's it.

1237
01:13:05.673 --> 01:13:08.039
You and me. I... we're done.

1238
01:13:08.134 --> 01:13:09.999
I can't do this.

1239
01:13:10.094 --> 01:13:12.676
Sarah. listen...

1240
01:13:12.763 --> 01:13:14.741
- That's... no. no.
- How many more signs do we need?

1241
01:13:14.765 --> 01:13:17.411
If it wasn't this. I'd be something
in one. two. five years from now.

1242
01:13:17.435 --> 01:13:18.299
Mm-hmm.

1243
01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:21.477
Listen to me. I... that's not...

1244
01:13:21.564 --> 01:13:24.476
Look. I am listening.
I'm finally listening to you.

1245
01:13:25.610 --> 01:13:27.441
But... don't you love me?

1246
01:13:28.905 --> 01:13:30.896
I ove isn't the issue here.

1247
01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:33.106
Yes. it is. It's the only issue.

1248
01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:35.680
Blake. I can't. Just. please...
Just don't make this any worse.

1249
01:13:35.745 --> 01:13:36.951
Yeah.

1250
01:13:37.038 --> 01:13:39.078
- Wait. just give me another chance.
- I'm pregnant.

1251
01:13:41.626 --> 01:13:44.618
Okay. that's fine. That's great!

1252
01:13:44.712 --> 01:13:46.828
I mean. now the plan
is you get me out of here...

1253
01:13:46.923 --> 01:13:49.881
No. No. the plan is I'm going
to stay at my parents' house.

1254
01:13:49.967 --> 01:13:53.380
and do not come and try to see me.

1255
01:13:53.471 --> 01:13:56.884
and... I really think
he means it this time.

1256
01:13:58.935 --> 01:14:00.926

- Yeah.

1263
01:14:14.867 --> 01:14:15.947
- Sad.
- Okay.

1264
01:14:16.035 --> 01:14:17.866

- I'll see you Saturday.
- Okay. see you then.

1284
01:15:33.029 --> 01:15:34.940
Jj

1285
01:16:15.905 --> 01:16:17.315
Jesus..

1286
01:16:26.290 --> 01:16:29.202

01:16:29.293 --> 01:16:32.660
You... you look amazing.

1288
01:16:32.755 --> 01:16:38.295
- I... Blake. I wasn't expecting...
- No. I wasn't either.

1289
01:16:38.385 --> 01:16:41.092
Edna called me
and said I should stop by today.

1290
01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:43.045
Yeah. me too.

1291
01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:46.052
The house looks amazing.
You've been busy.

1292
01:16:46.143 --> 01:16:47.863
No. no. I didn't...
I didn't do any of this.

1293
01:16:48.646 --> 01:16:49.646
What?

1294
01:16:52.191 --> 01:16:53.191
Who did?

1295
01:16:54.276 --> 01:16:55.561
Truce. truce.

1296
01:16:55.653 --> 01:16:57.881
- Peace. peace. Truce. truce.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

1297
01:16:57.905 --> 01:16:59.800
Look. look. look. just give me
five minutes of your time.

1298
01:16:59.824 --> 01:17:01.280
just five minutes and I'll be gone.

1299
01:17:01.367 --> 01:17:03.358
You'll never see my face again.
I promise. please.

1300
01:17:03.452 --> 01:17:06.159
I'll give you 30 seconds.
you fucking asshole.

1301
01:17:06.247 --> 01:17:08.809
Look. it's really important to me
that a family lives in this house.

1302
01:17:08.833 --> 01:17:11.870
Not me. not anyone else. but a family.

1303
01:17:12.962 --> 01:17:16.500
And I want it to be your family.
so. you guys. please. just...

1304
01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:19.707
Just don't put the house
on the market just yet. please.

1305
01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:23.210
You did this? How?

1306
01:17:25.015 --> 01:17:27.506
I sold Napoleon's hat.

1307
01:17:27.601 --> 01:17:30.183
- A... a Napoleon hat paid for all this?
- No.

1308
01:17:30.271 --> 01:17:31.761
Not a Napoleon's hat.

1309
01:17:31.856 --> 01:17:34.268
Fuckin' Napoleon's hat. dude.

1310
01:17:34.358 --> 01:17:35.598
- I don't understand.
- No...

1311
01:17:35.693 --> 01:17:37.733
That stuff in the cardboard boxes
in the back. okay?

1312
01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:39.981
That was my dad's stuff.
It was my inheritance.

1313
01:17:40.072 --> 01:17:41.653
I found it was worth millions.

1314
01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:44.026
Dude. I'm a fuckin' millionaire
on top of it.

1315
01:17:44.118 --> 01:17:47.360
Slum dude millionaire. bro.
That's fuckin' weird.

1316
01:17:47.454 --> 01:17:48.890
- Congrats.
- I'm a fuckin' millionaire.

1317
01:17:48.914 --> 01:17:50.154
That's awesome.

1318
01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:54.020
- Yeah. that's really cool.
- That's great.

1319
01:17:54.044 --> 01:17:57.457
Listen. and there's just. uh... man.

1320
01:17:57.548 --> 01:17:59.914
There's just one more thing
that I got to tell you guys

1321
01:18:00.009 --> 01:18:04.093
that I... I've been keeping from you guys
for quite some time.

1322
01:18:07.474 --> 01:18:09.089
What is it?

1323
01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:12.803
The main reason why I didn't want
to get rid of this house and let it go...

1324
01:18:13.814 --> 01:18:15.224
Is 'cause this...

1325
01:18:16.775 --> 01:18:18.356
This is my family's house.

1326
01:18:18.444 --> 01:18:21.436
My childhood home.
I actually grew up here my whole life.

1327
01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:23.771
When my parents both died
they left it to me.

1328
01:18:23.866 --> 01:18:26.903
so I just moved
into the guest house and...

1329
01:18:28.204 --> 01:18:30.866
I had no other plan
but to stall the sale.

1330
01:18:32.041 --> 01:18:34.282
So when you guys came around. I just...

1331
01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:38.119
- I fuckin' freaked out. man.
- Yeah. Yeah. you really did.

1332
01:18:38.214 --> 01:18:41.923
I'm ready to let it go. okay.
and just give you guys my house.

1333
01:18:42.009 --> 01:18:44.216
To start a family.
Here. your family.

You're my friend. dudes. You guys
are my friend. dudes. Please.

01:18:51.143 --> 01:18:54.635
And I have one other thing that I want

Well. this is it. guys.

This is where you're gonna
start your new life.

1344
01:19:18.295 --> 01:19:20.911
In Randy cockfield's childhood home.

1345
01:19:22.299 --> 01:19:24.415
- Uh...

1346
01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:26.125

1347
01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:30.338
when you bring Sarah into the field.
what are you gonna do with her?

1348
01:19:30.432 --> 01:19:32.272
- What are you gonna do with her. man?
- Don't.

1349
01:19:32.309 --> 01:19:33.309
Come on. say it.

- Give you his cock!
- That's right. yeah.

01:19:37.815 --> 01:19:40.272
Is this beautiful or what. guys?
I mean. come on.

1353
01:19:40.359 --> 01:19:42.896
- Don't worry about it.

1354
01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:47.237
Sarah.

1355
01:19:51.370 --> 01:19:53.486
All right. too long on the hug.
Too long.

1356
01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:56.071
Okay. Thank you. Thank...
No. no. no.

1357
01:19:56.166 --> 01:19:57.406

01:20:16.645 --> 01:20:20.103
And just like that. he's gone.

1361
01:20:25.904 --> 01:20:29.317
A little dinosaur.
Like a little dinosaur.

1362
01:20:29.408 --> 01:20:31.273
Do you wanna be a dinosaur?

1363
01:20:33.412 --> 01:20:35.403
Hey. Got an email from Randy.

1364
01:20:35.497 --> 01:20:37.533
He signed it "admiral cockfield."

1365
01:20:37.624 --> 01:20:39.227
which I actually think
works more than Randy.

1366
01:20:39.251 --> 01:20:41.617
I wonder where he is.

1367
01:20:41.712 --> 01:20:43.248
Do I... wait. do I wanna know?

1368
01:20:43.339 --> 01:20:45.751
Well. he sent a link.
Do you wanna watch it?

1369
01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:48.799
- Uh-uh.
- Fuck it. I'm clicking it.

1370
01:20:48.886 --> 01:20:49.886
Cover him up.

1371
01:20:50.888 --> 01:20:52.424
Yo. what's up Blake and Sarah?

1372
01:20:52.514 --> 01:20:55.256
Wanted to let you know
that I'm livin' my life.

1373
01:20:55.351 --> 01:20:57.387
It's Randy cockfield.

1374
01:20:57.478 --> 01:20:58.558
I bought a boat.

1375
01:20:58.645 --> 01:21:01.102
