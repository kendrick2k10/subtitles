this isn't a social call?

I'm afraid not.

He's my kid. you see.

606
00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:49.584
I want to know when the last
time you spoke with him was.

607
00:35:49.619 --> 00:35:52.422
It's been years.
and you know it. What's up?

608

Your boy murdered eight
federal agents in cold blood.

00:35:58.430 --> 00:35:59.726
Federal agents?

611
00:35:59.761 --> 00:36:01.123
They were there
to question him.

612
00:36:01.158 --> 00:36:02.828
You don't send a wet team in

613

to question someone like Peter.
and you know that.

614
00:36:05.503 --> 00:36:06.832
And you didn't call me?

615
00:36:06.867 --> 00:36:08.306
We have intel
he's in possession

616
00:36:08.341 --> 00:36:10.000

617
00:36:10.035 --> 00:36:11.936
He's a national security threat.

How'd you find him?

619
00:36:14.237 --> 00:36:15.841
The question we should be asking

620
00:36:15.876 --> 00:36:17.975
is why would your son steal
classified documents

621
00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:19.944
from the U.S. government?

622
00:36:19.979 --> 00:36:21.319
What's his motive?

623
00:36:21.354 --> 00:36:23.079
Is Peter being set up?

624
00:36:23.114 --> 00:36:24.817
Is the company
covering its tracks.

625
00:36:24.852 --> 00:36:26.786
and using you to do that?
Oh. no. sir.

626
00:36:26.821 --> 00:36:29.184
We are just trying to get
to the bottom of this.

627
00:36:30.121 --> 00:36:31.857
Do you know
where Peter would go.

628
00:36:31.892 --> 00:36:33.529
or what he would want
with this intel?

629
00:36:33.564 --> 00:36:36.224
I don't know anything.
Agent Kim.

630

after the threat is neutralized!

1267
01:15:16.885 --> 01:15:19.655
Did you even search the girl
before you put her in holding?

1268
01:15:19.690 --> 01:15:20.953
Of course.
Really?

1269
01:15:20.988 --> 01:15:22.724
Then what the fuck is this?

1270
01:15:25.157 --> 01:15:26.486
Fail.

The Painter is incoming.

1273
01:15:30.063 --> 01:15:33.229
I need eyes on him before he
steps foot into this facility.

1274
01:15:33.264 --> 01:15:34.736
Am I clear?

1275
01:15:34.771 --> 01:15:36.672
Move!
[man] You heard her! Let's go!

1276

We are empty over there!

1285
01:16:04.702 --> 01:16:06.735
North is good.
We need the west side. though.

1286
01:16:06.770 --> 01:16:07.670
West side. please.

1287
01:16:11.632 --> 01:16:15.040
All right. Let's go! Let's go!
Come on! Move it!

1288
01:16:15.075 --> 01:16:17.977

1313
01:18:06.252 --> 01:18:08.824
We need to move you to

[gunfire in distance]
Why are you helping me?

1315
01:18:10.828 --> 01:18:13.422
The situation
has gotten out of control.

1316
01:18:15.327 --> 01:18:16.997
It is too dangerous
for you here.

1317
01:18:17.032 --> 01:18:19.769
What about my dad?
Is he okay?

1318
01:18:25.172 --> 01:18:26.908
We need to go now.

I'll take it from here.

[ears ringing]
[Kim] I can't let you do that.

1343
01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:54.990
You're disregarding
a direct order from a superior.

1344
01:20:55.025 --> 01:20:56.816
Stand the fuck down. Agent Kim.

1345
01:20:56.851 --> 01:20:59.390
It's over. Piasecki!
This whole operation is over.

1346
01:20:59.425 --> 01:21:00.886
I am taking her in. and we can--

Come on. kid. Move.

1352
01:21:31.787 --> 01:21:32.962
Let her go.

1353

Let's finish this.

[Sophia whispers] Dad.

1358
01:21:49.343 --> 01:21:51.871
[imitates gunshot] Really?
Come on. You're gonna shoot me?

1359
01:21:51.906 --> 01:21:54.412
That's so boring.
Let's play a game.

Patient Zero...

1362
01:21:58.319 --> 01:21:59.780
or the new-and-improved?

1363

I'm not here
for your milestones.

[rapid gunfire]

1365
01:22:07.922 --> 01:22:10.725
Really? You're gonna deprive me

1366
01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:13.893
of the opportunity to prove
that I'm better than you?

1367
01:22:13.928 --> 01:22:17.006
That's... No. that's...
That's fair. That makes sense.

I don't want to do this. kid.

1372

These people. they...

1373
01:22:42.594 --> 01:22:46.233
kidnapped you. tortured you.
brainwashed you.

1374
01:22:46.268 --> 01:22:49.401
all to make you something
you were never supposed to be.

1375
01:22:49.436 --> 01:22:50.798
Me.

1376
01:22:53.836 --> 01:22:55.374
What's your real name?

1377
01:22:56.542 --> 01:22:59.807
It's... It's Daniel.

1378
01:22:59.842 --> 01:23:02.183
Well. it doesn't have
to go down like this. Daniel.

1379

You can go have a whole life.

1380

Fall in love. have kids.

1381
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:08.156
But you got to make
that choice for yourself.

1382
01:23:08.191 --> 01:23:09.652

But I like who I am.

1385
01:23:15.957 --> 01:23:17.858
So enough with the pity party.

1386
01:23:17.893 --> 01:23:19.596
And don't feel sorry for me.

1387
01:23:19.631 --> 01:23:22.368
Sure. the whole forced-blindness
thing kind of sucked.

1388
01:23:22.403 --> 01:23:24.205
but it made me special.

1389
01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:25.536
And for the record.

1390
01:23:25.571 --> 01:23:28.440
they didn't force me
to be like you.

[neck cracks]

1392
01:23:30.345 --> 01:23:31.509

Hmm. Byrne told you about me?

1419
01:26:21.043 --> 01:26:22.779
He said you were ruthless.

1421
01:26:24.079 --> 01:26:26.552
I'm a little more than that.

1422
01:26:26.587 --> 01:26:29.819
God. Byrne would never
shut up about you.

1423
01:26:29.854 --> 01:26:32.492
All those years I worked
for him. he'd go on and on.

that ever was.

you're the only one

1428

that knows how
to dodge a bullet?

1429
01:26:49.577 --> 01:26:50.972
You're an Intern.

1430
01:26:51.007 --> 01:26:54.547
I'm the Head Intern. see?

1431
01:26:54.582 --> 01:26:57.143
They used to call me Mimic.
Now they call me the boss.

The Internship's yours.
It's always been yours.

1445
01:27:56.039 --> 01:27:58.204
It's the only thing
that makes sense.

1446
01:27:58.239 --> 01:28:00.712
That's absurd. Peter.
Don't lie to me!

1447
01:28:00.747 --> 01:28:02.417
You told me
you never worked with her.

1448
01:28:02.452 --> 01:28:04.111
but she sure seems
to know you.

1449
01:28:04.146 --> 01:28:06.619
She's an Intern.
She didn't start the program.

1450
01:28:06.654 --> 01:28:08.918
She couldn't have!
And you think it was me?

You must've been training her

to kill people for the CIA.

1453

You saw what I'd become.

1454

You figured
you could do it again.

1455
01:28:18.061 --> 01:28:20.600
Okay. You got me.

1456
01:28:21.537 --> 01:28:23.669
There's too much oversight here

1457

1458

I'm going to make you
section chief.

1460

I wanted you out of this.
"Out of this"?

She's been trying to kill me
since this started.

That's pretty fuckin' far
from "out."
