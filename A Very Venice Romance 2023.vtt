00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.512
[upbeat music]

4
00:00:14.472 --> 00:00:16.808
(SINGING) I think you
know what you need.

5
00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:23.940
Don't hesitate. take that leap.

6
00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:27.652
Better get up off that
bit. go ahead and jump

7
00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:31.364
on in if that's what you want.

8
00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:32.699
Come on.

9
00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:34.367
Hoo!

10
00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:36.369
If you're going to do it--
do it. do it. do it-- baby.

11
00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:37.162
do it right.

12
00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:38.705
Do. do it right.

13
00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:42.125
If you really want to
do. make sure it's right.

14
00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:43.877
Do. do it right.

15
00:00:43.918 --> 00:00:46.212
'Cause there ain't
nothing to it.

16
00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:49.716
But if you're gonna do it.
you better do it right.

17
00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:51.468
Do it. do it. do it right.

18
00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:52.135
Hey.

19
00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:54.929
Do. do it right.

20
00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:57.515
Now it ain't hard as it seems.

21
00:00:57.557 --> 00:00:58.975
Ooh. ooh. ooh. ooh.

22
00:00:59.017 --> 00:00:59.893
No.

23
00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:00.727
Do what you love--

24
00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:01.644
No. no. no.

25
00:01:01.686 --> 00:01:02.604
--chase your dreams.

26
00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:04.397
Ooh. ooh. ooh. ooh.

27
00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.735
And if you're trying your best.
one day it'll all makes sense.

28
00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:10.779
Now sing along.

29
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:11.780
Hey.

30
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:12.947
One more time.

31
00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:14.574
Come on.

32
00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:16.785
If you're gonna do it--
do it. do it. do it right.

33
00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:17.619
Better do it right.

34
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.079
Do. do it right.

35
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.372
If you really want.

36
00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:21.831
Do it. do it. do
it-- make sure it's--

37
00:01:21.873 --> 00:01:22.957
Hey. Evelyn.
You OK?

38
00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.875
Yeah.

39
00:01:28.463 --> 00:01:29.464
Hey. Sage.

40
00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:30.215
Hey. Amy.

41
00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:31.341
Is Naomi ready for me?

42
00:01:31.383 --> 00:01:33.134
No. she's just
about to finish up

43
00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:35.595
on her daily silent meditation.
so I cannot disturb her.

44
00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:37.347
Do you know how long
she's going to be?

45
00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:38.932
As you know. Naomi
does not like to limit

46
00:01:38.973 --> 00:01:40.767
herself with time restrictions.
- Hmm.

47
00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:42.936
Can I offer you a fresh
smoothie while you wait?

48
00:01:42.977 --> 00:01:44.646
Uh. I-- I ate already.

49
00:01:44.688 --> 00:01:45.772
Are you sure sure?

50
00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:47.148
It's got a hydrating compound.

51
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.566
Yeah. yeah. I know.

52
00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:49.651
No. I'm good.

53
00:01:49.693 --> 00:01:50.443
Thank you.

54
00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:51.111
Thanks.

55
00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:52.112
Send her up.

56
00:01:52.153 --> 00:01:52.946
SAGE: There you go.

57
00:01:52.987 --> 00:01:55.615
Thanks. Sage.

58
00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:56.700
Naomi.

59
00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:59.661
Amy.

60
00:01:59.703 --> 00:02:00.870
How was your weekend?

61
00:02:00.912 --> 00:02:02.205
Good.

62
00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:04.290
I was busy researching
and sampling

63
00:02:04.332 --> 00:02:05.792
our new meal prep kits.

64
00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:07.210
Work. work. work.

65
00:02:07.252 --> 00:02:08.211
You look tired.

66
00:02:08.253 --> 00:02:09.713
Gee. thanks.

67
00:02:09.754 --> 00:02:11.881
You know. studies show
a good work/life balance

68
00:02:11.923 --> 00:02:13.717
actually improves productivity.

69
00:02:13.758 --> 00:02:16.261
I didn't think my
productivity was an issue.

70
00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:18.638
You know you're outperforming
the development VPs.

71
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.431
Am I?

72
00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:20.140
No.

73
00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:21.641
I had no idea.

74
00:02:21.683 --> 00:02:24.310
You need to make space
for some joy in your life.

75
00:02:24.352 --> 00:02:26.563
You might consider a vacation.

76
00:02:26.604 --> 00:02:30.358
I was actually hoping
to joyfully discuss

77
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.528
our new line of meal prep kits.

78
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.696
Talk to me.

79
00:02:34.738 --> 00:02:36.406
Well. as you know.
this is a new department

80
00:02:36.448 --> 00:02:38.908
that Blossom is
exploring. and the market

81
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.493
is getting saturated.

82
00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:42.203
Well. we have excellent
market penetration in the health

83
00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:43.580
and wellness space.

84
00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:45.331
Which is why I want
to brand our new line

85
00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:48.001
of Blossom meal prep
kits with the tagline

86
00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:50.337
"hacking your health."

87
00:02:50.378 --> 00:02:51.921
Catchy.
I like that.

88
00:02:51.963 --> 00:02:53.590
We're incorporating
all the latest

89
00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:56.676
Blossom supplements to promote
general health and well-being.

90
00:02:56.718 --> 00:02:58.219
Great idea.

91
00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:00.597
You and I have always resonated
on the same frequency.

92
00:03:00.638 --> 00:03:01.723
[chuckles]

93
00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:04.184
Oh. I sense discomfort.

94
00:03:04.225 --> 00:03:06.478
Our consulting
chef Jean-Paul. he

95
00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.188
can't seem to blend
the supplements without

96
00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:10.190
ruining the flavor profiles.

97
00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:12.859
The meal kits just
don't taste very good.

98
00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:14.235
So tell him that.

99
00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:17.364
Jean-Paul doesn't
exactly enjoy criticism.

100
00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:19.783
Well. we can't hack
anyone's health if they

101
00:03:19.824 --> 00:03:21.451
don't enjoy eating the food.

102
00:03:21.493 --> 00:03:22.077
No.

103
00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:23.703
No. we can't.

104
00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:29.125
So I was wondering if you
might want to talk to him.

105
00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:30.960
Thank you. but no.

106
00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:33.880
You said you love your job.
and this is a part of it.

107
00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:36.174
I would not want to deprive
you of an opportunity

108
00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:37.050
for personal growth.

109
00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:39.719
[chuckles] I got it.

110
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:41.638
You do.

111
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.430
Thank you. Amy.

112
00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:44.432
Be well.

113
00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:46.434
Sage.

114
00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:48.770
Good morning. boss.

115
00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:50.230
Good morning. doc.

116
00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:52.524
And how's our chef doing today?

117
00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:53.983
JEAN-PAUL: I'm not your chef.

118
00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:55.235
Oh. OK.

119
00:03:55.276 --> 00:03:56.861
And I'm trying
to figure out why

120
00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:59.489
you have me working with people
who know nothing about food.

121
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:01.408
That's not fair. Jean-Paul.

122
00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:03.451
Dr. Higgins is one of the top
food scientists in the country.

123
00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:04.703
He's just not a chef.

124
00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:06.079
Clearly not.

125
00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:08.123
I was wondering if
I could talk to you.

126
00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:10.041
You are talking to me.

127
00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:12.127
In private.

128
00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:13.253
I'm making a souffle.

129
00:04:13.294 --> 00:04:15.338
I cannot leave my oven.

130
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.925
OK. well. Naomi and I have
a few notes on the new line

131
00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:20.010
of meal prep kits.

132
00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:21.261
Notes.

133
00:04:21.302 --> 00:04:22.721
What kind of notes?

134
00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:24.681
Well. let's start
with the duck recipe.

135
00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:26.474
Confit de canard
is my favorite dish.

136
00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:28.268
But the recipe calls
for the duck to be

137
00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:30.103
slow roasted for two hours.

138
00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:31.312
Our customers are busy.

139
00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:32.272
They don't want to
cook anything that

140
00:04:32.313 --> 00:04:33.356
takes more than 30 minutes.

141
00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:34.232
According to who?

142
00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:35.358
Our focus groups.

143
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.526
Focus groups?

144
00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:37.944
Those people have no taste.

145
00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:39.612
And me.

146
00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:41.322
I tried making the recipe
on the weekend with prep.

147
00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:43.033
It took me more
than three hours.

148
00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:44.576
Perhaps you're
just a bad cook.

149
00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:47.454
[laughs sarcastically] I
know how to follow a recipe.

150
00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:49.372
French cuisine is
an art form. Amy.

151
00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:51.249
It is considered to be
the most prestigious

152
00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:52.876
cuisine in the world.

153
00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:54.961
And I love that. but you've
got to work with me here.

154
00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:56.671
Jean-Paul.

155
00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:58.465
We're selling meal prep kits.
not a restaurant experience.

156
00:04:58.506 --> 00:05:00.383
The meals need to take
less than 30 minutes.

157
00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:02.135
And we haven't even talked
about the taste yet.

158
00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:03.511
What's wrong with the taste?

159
00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:05.597
Don't take this the
wrong way. but the meals

160
00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:07.057
just aren't tasting that great.

161
00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:08.141
Says who?

162
00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:09.142
Focus groups?

163
00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:10.268
No. no. me.

164
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.978
It doesn't taste great.

165
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.481
It's because French food has
a delicate balance of flavors

166
00:05:14.522 --> 00:05:16.900
and your supplements
are throwing them off.

167
00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:19.486
We hired you to blend our
supplements in your recipes.

168
00:05:19.527 --> 00:05:21.321
Maybe you need to
change the supplements.

169
00:05:21.363 --> 00:05:22.739
No. no. no. we can't do that.

170
00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:25.116
And I can't change 200
years of French cuisine.

171
00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:26.951
[sighs] OK.

172
00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:29.829
You're the chef. I can't
tell you what to do.

173
00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:31.206
Good.

174
00:05:31.247 --> 00:05:33.166
But as far as the meal
prep kit recipes go.

175
00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:34.584
you're not quite there yet.

176
00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:36.044
I'm not quite there yet?

177
00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:36.920
Me?

178
00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:37.962
So that's my fault?

179
00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:38.922
No. no. no. no.

180
00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:40.006
This is nobody's fault--

181
00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:41.800
Stop.

182
00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:44.052
I'm sorry. but I can't listen
to you insult French cuisine.

183
00:05:44.094 --> 00:05:45.679
I'm not insulting

184
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.889
I think you may be being
just a touch sensitive here--

185
00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:48.723
I'm not sensitive.

186
00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:49.349
OK.

187
00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:50.725
That's enough.

188
00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:51.559

- Wait.

189
00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:52.769
What?

190
00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:54.187
No. no. no. no. no.
you can't do this.

191
00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:55.689
Watch me.

192
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.732
But Jean-Paul. we can
figure this out together.

193
00:05:57.774 --> 00:06:01.778
We'll have to be together
with Dr. Frankenfood.

194
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:02.696
Good luck.

201
00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:27.262
Just a slight cleanse to
the aesthetic of two and four

202
00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:28.930

go as well as planned.

I'm sorry. we may have
gone down the wrong path

I hope you have a
right path in the works.

211
00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:52.912
Well. I thought we might try
Professor Higgins' recipes.

212
00:06:52.954 --> 00:06:54.164
Dr. Frankenfood?

213
00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:55.915
[sighs] Does
everyone call him that?

214
00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:59.085
He's a brilliant scientist.
and his food tastes like dirt.

215
00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:00.295
Not the good kind.

216
00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:02.088
Right.

217
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.884
Well. I've been proactive in
looking at several new chefs

218
00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:08.678
if we didn't want to go
with Professor Higgins.

219
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.016
And I've zeroed in on an
Italian chef. Marcello Favreau.

220
00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:15.643
He had a restaurant here
in New York. Ciao Bella.

221
00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:17.103
Oh. I remember that place.

222

Incredible pasta.

223
00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:20.106
And he's handsome.

224
00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:21.608
Always good for marketing.

225
00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:24.235
Marcello quit Cia Bella
opened an exclusive cooking

226
00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:29.282

I'd like to take a run at him.

227
00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:32.452
An Italian curated
meal prep kit?

228
00:07:32.494 --> 00:07:34.496
Does that sound healthy to you?

229
00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:37.957
Well. Dr. Higgins thinks
that the Italian flavor

230
00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:42.128
profiles will be a good match
for the Blossom supplements.

231
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.004
All right.

232
00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:44.214
Worth a shot.

233
00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:46.091
If you think you can land him.

234
00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:47.217

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:48.468

00:12:27.831 --> 00:12:28.581
Can you take my bag?

367
00:12:28.623 --> 00:12:29.582
Si.

368
00:12:29.624 --> 00:12:31.626
Oh. thank you very much.

369
00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:32.961
I'm good. I'm good.
Thank you.

370
00:12:33.003 --> 00:12:33.670
Yeah.

371
00:12:33.712 --> 00:12:35.088
[speaking italian]

372
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:37.590
No. actually. uh. can
you just help me. um--

373
00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:39.050
[speaking italian]

374
00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:39.843
Uh. whoa.

375
00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:40.760
[speaking italian]

376
00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:41.886
OK. you sure?
OK.

377
00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:42.637
Yeah.
- Just jump.

378
00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:43.471
Whoa!

379
00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:48.435
I'm so sorry.

380
00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:51.312
[speaking italian]

381
00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:52.313
Marcello?

382
00:12:52.355 --> 00:12:55.150
[speaking italian]

383
00:12:57.694 --> 00:12:58.695
I'm so sorry.

384
00:12:58.737 --> 00:12:59.612
I'm really sorry.

385
00:12:59.654 --> 00:13:00.447
I didn't-- I didn't--

386
00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:01.406
I didn't mean to.

387
00:13:01.448 --> 00:13:02.365
I didn't know.

388
00:13:02.407 --> 00:13:03.658
I-- I'm so. so sorry.

389
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.534
It's OK.

390
00:13:04.576 --> 00:13:05.326
Oh my goodness.

391
00:13:05.368 --> 00:13:06.453
It's OK.

392
00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:07.787
Are you OK?
- Yeah. yeah.

393
00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:08.621
I'm fine.

394
00:13:08.663 --> 00:13:09.622
Are you OK?

395
00:13:09.664 --> 00:13:10.665
I'm fine.
Wet.

396
00:13:10.707 --> 00:13:12.083
- Yeah.
- But fine.

397
00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:13.501
Yeah.

398
00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:16.379
Let me pay for your dry
cleaning and some more flowers.

399
00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:18.048
No. there's no need. really.

400
00:13:18.089 --> 00:13:19.299
No. no. no. no. please--

401
00:13:19.341 --> 00:13:20.633
Look. I'm in a rush.

402
00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:21.760
I'm late. sorry.

403
00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:22.886
Have a lovely day.
Ciao.

404
00:13:22.927 --> 00:13:23.803
No. but I insist--

405
00:13:23.845 --> 00:13:24.637
Thank you.

406
00:13:24.679 --> 00:13:26.389
But-- I'm Amy.

407
00:13:26.431 --> 00:13:28.391
We spoke on the phone.

408
00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:29.267
Oh.

409
00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:33.521
[jazzy music]

410
00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:40.987
[singing in italian]

411
00:13:58.880 --> 00:13:59.714
JESSICA: Oh. hi.

412
00:13:59.756 --> 00:14:01.007
Oh. hi.

413
00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:02.342
Are you here for
the cooking course?

414
00:14:02.384 --> 00:14:03.176
Yeah. I'm Amy.

415
00:14:03.218 --> 00:14:04.094
- Oh. Jessica.
- Hi.

416
00:14:04.135 --> 00:14:05.303
First time in Venice?

417
00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:06.012
First time in Italy.

418
00:14:06.054 --> 00:14:07.389
This villa is amazing.

419
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:08.848
Isn't it?

420
00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:10.433
It's been in Marcello's
family for centuries.

421
00:14:10.475 --> 00:14:11.893
Wow.

422
00:14:11.935 --> 00:14:13.311
They converted it to a
boutique hotel years ago

423
00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:16.356
and now Marcello runs
a cooking school here.

424
00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:17.732
Welcome to Venezia.

425
00:14:17.774 --> 00:14:19.150
I am Caterina.

426
00:14:19.192 --> 00:14:20.568
I manage the cooking
school and the hotel.

427
00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:21.695
Wow.

428
00:14:21.736 --> 00:14:22.946
May I offer you a prosecco?

429
00:14:22.987 --> 00:14:24.406
Oh. uh. I--

430
00:14:24.447 --> 00:14:25.990
You're in Italy for the
first time in your life.

431
00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:27.701
Of course. you'll
have a prosecco.

432
00:14:27.742 --> 00:14:28.535
Cheers.

433
00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:29.369
JESSICA: Saluti.

434
00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:31.037
Saluti.

435
00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:32.580
I'll check you in and then
I'll show you to your room.

436
00:14:32.622 --> 00:14:34.290
Mm. thank you.

437
00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:35.417
Hi.

438
00:14:35.458 --> 00:14:36.710
Thanks.

439
00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:38.378
Actually. I just need some--

440
00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.505
[speaking italian]

441
00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:48.096
AUTOMATED TRANSLATOR: I'm
sorry. but an idiotic tourist

442
00:14:48.138 --> 00:14:50.223
pushed me into the canal.

443
00:14:50.265 --> 00:14:51.057
Oh. uh.

444
00:14:53.643 --> 00:14:54.477
Hi.

445
00:14:54.519 --> 00:14:55.562
Hi.

446
00:14:55.603 --> 00:14:57.105
Hello again.

447
00:14:57.147 --> 00:14:58.940
Hello.

448
00:14:58.982 --> 00:15:01.985
Let me say. that's a terrible
translation. by the way.

449
00:15:02.027 --> 00:15:05.238
Yeah. I think we all
know what "idiota" means.

450
00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.531
[chuckles]

451
00:15:06.573 --> 00:15:07.907
Excuse my son.

452
00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:09.492
Sometimes he doesn't
think before he speaks.

453
00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:10.326
AMY: Mm-hmm.

454
00:15:10.368 --> 00:15:11.077
Thanks.

455
00:15:11.119 --> 00:15:13.621
Anyhow. Marcello Favero.

456
00:15:13.663 --> 00:15:15.331
Pleased to meet you

457
00:15:15.373 --> 00:15:16.249
Amy Bellefarr.

458
00:15:16.291 --> 00:15:17.292
Idiot tourist.

459
00:15:17.334 --> 00:15:20.462
[laughs] How do
I know this name?

460
00:15:20.503 --> 00:15:21.755
[speaking italian]

461
00:15:21.796 --> 00:15:23.465
AUTOMATED TRANSLATOR:
Because she signed

462
00:15:23.506 --> 00:15:25.175
up for the cooking course.

463
00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:27.177
I'm going to turn this off.

464
00:15:27.218 --> 00:15:28.928
I actually work for Blossom.

465
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.055
We spoke on the phone.

466
00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:31.556
I offered you a job.

467
00:15:31.598 --> 00:15:32.515
I love Blossom.

468
00:15:32.557 --> 00:15:33.433
AMY: Really?

469
00:15:33.475 --> 00:15:34.768
You're hiring Marcello?

470
00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:38.271
Trying to. but he
hung up on me yesterday.

471
00:15:38.313 --> 00:15:39.939
I thought I'd try
you again in person.

472
00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:41.608
So you came to
Venice for that?

473
00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:44.069
[speaking italian]

474
00:15:49.657 --> 00:15:51.159
I'll see you later.

475
00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:52.619
Jessie. I'll see you later.

476
00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:53.495
Welcome.

477
00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:54.579
Sort of.

478
00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:55.497
Welcome.

479
00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:57.374
[speaking italian]

480
00:15:58.667 --> 00:15:59.459
Wow.

481
00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:04.839
This is going to be fun.

482
00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:05.715
Cheers.

483
00:16:05.757 --> 00:16:06.591
Saluti.

484
00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:07.676
Saluti.

485
00:16:07.717 --> 00:16:10.637
[singing in italian]

486
00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:12.931
Hey.

487
00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:14.557
[gasps] Hello.

488
00:16:14.599 --> 00:16:15.642
You look great.

489
00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:16.476
Oh. thank you.

490
00:16:16.518 --> 00:16:17.352
You too.

491
00:16:17.394 --> 00:16:18.478
Thank you.

492
00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.479
Oh. these look good.

493
00:16:19.521 --> 00:16:20.271
Yeah. right?

494
00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:24.442
Oh. yeah.

495
00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:26.194
Wow.

496
00:16:26.236 --> 00:16:28.279
So how did you find
Marcello's cooking school?

497
00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:30.156
Oh. one of the chefs
at the restaurant I work

498
00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:31.700
at recommended it.

499
00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:34.536
I took a course with Marcello
last year and loved it.

500
00:16:34.577 --> 00:16:36.496
so here I am again.

501
00:16:36.538 --> 00:16:37.664
So you're a chef?

502
00:16:37.706 --> 00:16:39.040
I'm working as
a kitchen porter

503
00:16:39.082 --> 00:16:41.876
at a restaurant in
Seattle. but the dream is

504
00:16:41.918 --> 00:16:43.753
to open my own place one day.

505
00:16:43.795 --> 00:16:45.296
Well. here's to
dreams coming true.

506
00:16:45.338 --> 00:16:46.840
- Saluti.
- Saluti.

507
00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:48.174
Jessica. darling.

508
00:16:48.216 --> 00:16:49.092
Oh.

509
00:16:49.134 --> 00:16:51.011
Wonderful to see you again.

510
00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:53.513
Oh. you too. Olivia.

511
00:16:53.555 --> 00:16:54.723
So this is Amy.

512
00:16:54.764 --> 00:16:55.598
Hey.

513
00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.017
Oh. pleasure.

514
00:16:57.058 --> 00:16:58.309
Where's Harry?

515
00:16:58.351 --> 00:17:01.771
Oh. uh. probably
at home. I imagine.

516
00:17:01.813 --> 00:17:02.856
Harry and I are no more.

517
00:17:02.897 --> 00:17:04.441
He ran off with the dog walker.

518
00:17:04.482 --> 00:17:05.650
Oh. I'm sorry.

519
00:17:05.692 --> 00:17:07.152
Oh no. don't be sorry.

520
00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:09.029
I get to keep the dog. so
I think I got the better

521
00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:11.031
end of the deal. am I right?

522
00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:13.533
Olivia also took
Marcello's course last year.

523
00:17:13.575 --> 00:17:14.826
He's a genius.

524
00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:15.910
I'll let you in on
the little secret.

525
00:17:15.952 --> 00:17:17.370
Please.

526
00:17:17.412 --> 00:17:19.247
Marcello is a darling
and he will always

527
00:17:19.289 --> 00:17:20.957
be polite about your food.

528
00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:24.544
But that makes it impossible to
know whether he really likes it

529
00:17:24.586 --> 00:17:25.962
or not.
AMY: Yeah.

530
00:17:26.004 --> 00:17:27.922
Olivia here's a little
competitive about which

531
00:17:27.964 --> 00:17:29.883
dish Marcello likes best.

532
00:17:29.924 --> 00:17:32.385
So is this a
little competition?

533
00:17:32.427 --> 00:17:34.679
Oh no. no. Marcello
hates competition.

534
00:17:34.721 --> 00:17:36.181
AMY: Oh.

535
00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:38.141
But that doesn't mean
to say that the rest of us

536
00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:41.770
can't have a little
friendly rivalry on the sly.

537
00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:43.480
[chuckling]

538
00:17:43.521 --> 00:17:46.066
Oh hey. you know
who I think that is

539
00:17:46.107 --> 00:17:47.817
in the blue shirt over there?

540
00:17:47.859 --> 00:17:49.110
Bradford Duncan.

541
00:17:49.152 --> 00:17:50.779
He's some kind of
history professor.

542
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:54.491
By the looks of it. he's much
more interested in Venetian art

543
00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:55.658
than in the food.

544
00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:56.910
Good evening. ladies

545
00:17:56.951 --> 00:17:57.869
Oh. Marcello.

546
00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:03.249
So nice to see you.

547
00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:05.418
Olivia. Jesse. and
I. we are old friends.

548
00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.461
I see. I see.

549
00:18:06.503 --> 00:18:08.630
And I don't know
anything about you

550
00:18:08.672 --> 00:18:12.092
except that you work
for Blossom and you tend

551
00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:13.927
to push people in the canal.

552
00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:15.762
Again. I am so sorry.

553
00:18:15.804 --> 00:18:17.138
I'm just kidding.

554
00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.766
Amy came to try and
hire Marcello for--

555
00:18:19.808 --> 00:18:21.768
actually. what did you
want to hire Marcello for?

556
00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:25.230
We want him to help curate
our new line of Hacking

557
00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:26.815
Your Health meal prep kits.

558
00:18:26.856 --> 00:18:28.108
Hacking Your Health?

559
00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:29.567
What the heck is that?

560
00:18:29.609 --> 00:18:31.820
We're developing
organic meal prep kits

561
00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:33.196
that blend a range
of supplements

562
00:18:33.238 --> 00:18:35.949
into the food to deliver
optimum wellness.

563
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:38.201
Those kits are filled
with preservatives

564
00:18:38.243 --> 00:18:40.870
and processed food.
and it's just an insult

565
00:18:40.912 --> 00:18:42.664
to the art of cooking.

566
00:18:42.706 --> 00:18:44.958
So I keep being told.

567
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.461
Listen. Amy. um. I
appreciate your flying

568
00:18:48.503 --> 00:18:51.339
all this way to see me.
but I'm afraid you're

569
00:18:51.381 --> 00:18:52.841
just wasting your time.

570
00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:54.300
[laughs] But--

571
00:18:54.342 --> 00:18:57.637
What we can do now. I
could return your money.

572
00:18:57.679 --> 00:19:00.432
you can stay at the Villa until
you find a flight back home.

573
00:19:00.473 --> 00:19:03.810
But you haven't
heard my pitch yet.

574
00:19:03.852 --> 00:19:05.812
'Cause I'm just
not interested.

575
00:19:05.854 --> 00:19:07.856
Sorry for that.

576
00:19:07.897 --> 00:19:09.566
Anyhow. have a good evening.

577
00:19:09.607 --> 00:19:10.900
[speaking italian]

578
00:19:10.942 --> 00:19:11.901
Ciao.

579
00:19:11.943 --> 00:19:12.777
Ciao.

580
00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:15.238
Ciao.

581
00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.281
Welcome to Venice.

582
00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:19.701
Saluti.

583
00:19:38.553 --> 00:19:40.055
- Oh. Marcello.
- Hey.

584
00:19:40.096 --> 00:19:40.972
Bonjourno.

585
00:19:41.014 --> 00:19:42.223
Bonjourno too.

586
00:19:42.265 --> 00:19:43.641
So what are you
doing at the market?

587
00:19:43.683 --> 00:19:44.934
Jet lag.

588
00:19:44.976 --> 00:19:45.935
This market is amazing.

589
00:19:45.977 --> 00:19:47.228
Yes.

590
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:49.189
It's been here for
over 800 years.

591
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:50.982
Wow. that's crazy.

592
00:19:51.024 --> 00:19:53.109
It is.

593
00:19:53.151 --> 00:19:55.236
I was wondering if
I could talk to you

594
00:19:55.278 --> 00:19:56.863
about curating the recipes.

595
00:19:56.905 --> 00:19:58.114
Right.

596
00:19:58.156 --> 00:20:00.200
Um. I've already
told you last night.

597
00:20:00.241 --> 00:20:01.451
I'm not interested in that--

598
00:20:01.493 --> 00:20:02.118
Blossom.

599
00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.536
Blossom.

600
00:20:03.578 --> 00:20:05.080
Yeah. but you still
haven't heard my offer.

601
00:20:05.121 --> 00:20:07.791
But I don't need
to hear any offer.

602
00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:09.334
Why not?

603
00:20:09.376 --> 00:20:11.503
Because I mean. Amy.
I've checked your website

604
00:20:11.544 --> 00:20:13.380
and you basically
sell supplements

605
00:20:13.421 --> 00:20:15.048
that boost energy. metabolism--

606
00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:17.300
Yeah. but those
supplements are

607
00:20:17.342 --> 00:20:19.969
being implemented
into our Hacking

608
00:20:20.011 --> 00:20:21.554
Your Health meal prep kits.

609
00:20:21.596 --> 00:20:24.557
But you wouldn't need
to do so if. as you say.

610
00:20:24.599 --> 00:20:26.685
your prep meals were healthy.

611
00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:27.686
They are healthy.

612
00:20:27.727 --> 00:20:29.396
No. they are not.

613
00:20:29.437 --> 00:20:32.107
I don't like the idea of having
science-based supplements

614
00:20:32.148 --> 00:20:33.441
in my food.

615
00:20:33.483 --> 00:20:36.778
Because for me.
preparing real good food

616
00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.155
brings nourishment
not only to our body.

617
00:20:39.197 --> 00:20:40.532
but even to our souls.

618
00:20:40.573 --> 00:20:41.825
[speaking italian]
- Right.

619
00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:42.701
OK.

620
00:20:42.742 --> 00:20:43.618
Hey. Marcello.

621
00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:44.244
Hey. Angelo.

622
00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:47.956
[speaking italian]

623
00:20:47.997 --> 00:20:48.790
This is Amy.

624
00:20:48.832 --> 00:20:49.624
Hi.

625
00:20:49.666 --> 00:20:50.333
Angelo.

626
00:20:50.375 --> 00:20:51.251
Pleased to meet you.

627
00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:52.043
American?

628
00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:53.169
Mm-hmm.

629
00:20:53.211 --> 00:20:55.130
Pleased to meet you too. Amy.

630
00:20:55.171 --> 00:21:01.428
Em. What is a beautiful woman
like you doing with this fool?

631
00:21:01.469 --> 00:21:03.972
[chuckles] Well. I'm actually
trying to convince this

632
00:21:04.014 --> 00:21:05.390
fool to come and work for me.

633
00:21:05.432 --> 00:21:07.183
Ah. that explains it.

634
00:21:07.225 --> 00:21:08.059
Mm-hmm.

635
00:21:08.101 --> 00:21:09.602
[laughs]

636
00:21:09.644 --> 00:21:12.272
[speaking italian]..
she's one of my students.

637
00:21:12.313 --> 00:21:13.940
So what's fresh this morning?

638
00:21:13.982 --> 00:21:17.068
Ah. langoustine.

639
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:18.611
Fresh from the
lagoon this morning.

640
00:21:18.653 --> 00:21:19.279
Wow.

641
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.739
Perfecto.

642
00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.198
So I'm going to take 12
of them for the school.

643
00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.158
Mm-hmm.

644
00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:25.368
[speaking italian]

645
00:21:26.786 --> 00:21:27.746
No problem.

646
00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:30.290
I will send them
to your villa. OK?

647
00:21:30.331 --> 00:21:31.041
Si. perfecto.

648
00:21:31.082 --> 00:21:32.083
OK.

649
00:21:32.125 --> 00:21:33.335
Nice to meet you. Amy.

650
00:21:33.376 --> 00:21:35.128
[laughs] You too. Angelo.

651
00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:36.004
OK.

652
00:21:36.046 --> 00:21:38.631
[speaking italian]

653
00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:42.427
Angelo doesn't really
know how to talk to a woman

654
00:21:42.469 --> 00:21:43.345
without flirting.

655
00:21:43.386 --> 00:21:44.304
It's an Italian thing.

656
00:21:44.346 --> 00:21:45.096
It's fine.

657
00:21:45.138 --> 00:21:47.223
I can handle it.

658
00:21:47.265 --> 00:21:48.224
What about you?

659
00:21:48.266 --> 00:21:49.851
What about me?

660
00:21:49.893 --> 00:21:51.895
You seem to be unflirty.

661
00:21:51.936 --> 00:21:53.813
[laughs] Unflirty?

662
00:21:53.855 --> 00:21:54.481
Is that a word?

663
00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:56.524
[laughs] It is now.

664
00:21:56.566 --> 00:21:58.610
I'm just trying to be
professional. you know.

665
00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:00.403
Well. if we're
being professional.

666
00:22:00.445 --> 00:22:02.238
then let me pitch.

667
00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.740
You don't give up. do you?

668
00:22:03.782 --> 00:22:04.491
No.

669
00:22:04.532 --> 00:22:05.200
No. I don't.

670
00:22:05.241 --> 00:22:06.534
OK.

671
00:22:06.576 --> 00:22:07.911
And the cooking
course is three weeks.

672
00:22:07.952 --> 00:22:10.914
So you know. plenty of
time to wear you down.

673
00:22:10.955 --> 00:22:12.749
I think you're just
wasting your time.

674
00:22:12.791 --> 00:22:14.125
But if you insist on staying--

675
00:22:14.167 --> 00:22:15.043
Oh. no.

676
00:22:15.085 --> 00:22:15.877
I'm staying.

677
00:22:15.919 --> 00:22:17.462
OK then.

678
00:22:17.504 --> 00:22:19.214
So you should take some time
and just enjoy the city.

679
00:22:19.255 --> 00:22:20.423
Absolutely.

680
00:22:20.465 --> 00:22:21.925
I've been reading
the guidebooks.

681
00:22:21.966 --> 00:22:24.135
No. no. just forget
about all the guidebooks.

682
00:22:24.177 --> 00:22:27.055
What you really need
is a local tour.

683
00:22:27.097 --> 00:22:30.058
It's the only one that matters.

684
00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.601
OK.

685
00:22:31.643 --> 00:22:34.020
Bene?

686
00:22:34.062 --> 00:22:38.400
[chuckles]

687
00:22:38.441 --> 00:22:39.526
So how did you find out?

688
00:22:39.567 --> 00:22:41.069
She brought back
the wrong dog.

689
00:22:41.111 --> 00:22:41.945
Hey.

690
00:22:41.986 --> 00:22:42.737
On the CCTV.

691
00:22:42.779 --> 00:22:43.738
Oh no.

692
00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.031
- I saw them kissing--
- Oh no!

693
00:22:45.073 --> 00:22:46.032
Outside.

694
00:22:46.074 --> 00:22:47.409
Can you imagine?

695
00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:49.577
Bonjourno. everyone.

696
00:22:49.619 --> 00:22:53.623
And welcome to the first class
of our advanced Italian cooking

697
00:22:53.665 --> 00:22:54.874
course.

698
00:22:54.916 --> 00:22:56.960
So first of all. find
a partner because you

699
00:22:57.002 --> 00:22:58.378
will be working in pairs.

700
00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.254
Teammate?

701
00:22:59.295 --> 00:23:00.714
Yes. please.

702
00:23:00.755 --> 00:23:03.425
OK. so you have to know
that cooking with others

703
00:23:03.466 --> 00:23:05.093
is an Italian way of life.

704
00:23:05.135 --> 00:23:08.430
It's an expression of
our land and culture.

705
00:23:08.471 --> 00:23:10.682
Said that. you must know
that every day we're

706
00:23:10.724 --> 00:23:13.435
going to be learning a new
Venetian speciality. but just

707
00:23:13.476 --> 00:23:14.769
in the morning.

708
00:23:14.811 --> 00:23:16.688
[gasps] This is going
to be so much fun.

709
00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:19.024
Because then after lunch
I'm going to take you out.

710
00:23:19.065 --> 00:23:21.067
We're going to go
and visit the city.

711
00:23:21.109 --> 00:23:26.114
We're going to see all the
historical and cultural sites.

712
00:23:26.156 --> 00:23:27.282
(WHISPERING) This is new.

713
00:23:27.323 --> 00:23:28.783
(WHISPERING)
It's all new to me.

714
00:23:28.825 --> 00:23:29.951
Oh. don't worry.

715
00:23:29.993 --> 00:23:31.202
I'll help you all
the way through it.

716
00:23:31.244 --> 00:23:32.829
After all. we're partners now.

717
00:23:32.871 --> 00:23:34.372
For our first
lesson. we're going

718
00:23:34.414 --> 00:23:36.458
to make one of my
favorite dishes.

719
00:23:36.499 --> 00:23:38.710
spaghetti alla
busara. which means

720
00:23:38.752 --> 00:23:40.545
spaghetti with langoustine.

721
00:23:40.587 --> 00:23:42.881
Would it be OK with everyone
if I record the lesson?

722
00:23:42.922 --> 00:23:45.467
I want to give my boss a
sense of the Italian dishes

723
00:23:45.508 --> 00:23:46.968
we might use for our meal kits.

724
00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:48.136
Yeah?
Cool.

725
00:23:48.178 --> 00:23:49.012
No. no. no. no. no.

726
00:23:49.054 --> 00:23:50.430
[speaking italian]

727
00:23:50.472 --> 00:23:52.557
I mean. my school is
not for your research.

728
00:23:52.599 --> 00:23:55.477
And no. it's not OK for me
that you are recording. so--

729
00:23:55.518 --> 00:23:56.853
Of course. no problem.

730
00:23:56.895 --> 00:23:57.687
OK.

731
00:23:57.729 --> 00:23:58.730
Grazie.

732
00:23:58.772 --> 00:24:00.106
Listen. Amy. you
have to understand

733
00:24:00.148 --> 00:24:01.691
that cooking is like love.

734
00:24:01.733 --> 00:24:07.030
It should be entered into
with abandon or not at all.

735
00:24:07.072 --> 00:24:08.114
I got it.

736
00:24:08.156 --> 00:24:08.907
Bene?

737
00:24:08.948 --> 00:24:09.699

Right now. it's nice to have
a family tasting instead.

767
00:25:29.612 --> 00:25:32.323
Perfecto.

768

Very good.

773
00:25:50.967 --> 00:25:53.803
But the flavor is
lacking. I'm afraid.

774
00:25:53.845 --> 00:25:55.764
Did you use any herbs?

775
00:25:55.805 --> 00:25:57.307
A little. but not enough.

776
00:25:57.349 --> 00:25:58.308
It was my fault.

777
00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:59.517
No.

778
00:25:59.559 --> 00:26:00.602
No. Amy. there's
no fault here.

779
00:26:00.643 --> 00:26:01.895

Perfectly balanced.

No. no. no.

No. I don't know
that he likes me.

My son has not spoken
about any other women

821

New York until he met you.

822
00:27:24.686 --> 00:27:26.479
What happened in New York?

823
00:27:26.521 --> 00:27:28.398
Oh. that is not
my story to tell.

824
00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:31.526
You should ask him.

825
00:27:31.568 --> 00:27:32.861
I would like to try this.
Oh.

Piazza San Marco is the
principal square of Venice.

832
00:27:50.962 --> 00:27:53.882
and the French emperor
called this piazza

833
00:27:53.923 --> 00:27:55.884
"The Drawing Room of Europe."

834
00:27:55.925 --> 00:27:56.551
Yes.

00:27:57.427 --> 00:27:58.928
I did. yes.

837
00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:00.722
I read this square as
the lowest part of Venice.

838
00:28:00.764 --> 00:28:03.391
Which is why it often floods.

839
00:28:03.433 --> 00:28:05.060

920
00:32:03.423 --> 00:32:07.218
For example. Bradford's cheese.
olives. and tomatoes pizza

921
00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:11.097
is strong. but at the same
time. simple and very delicious.

922
00:32:11.139 --> 00:32:15.977
Then we have Olivia's
wild mushrooms and olive.

923
00:32:16.019 --> 00:32:17.103
Dark and mysterious.

924
00:32:17.145 --> 00:32:18.646
[chuckling]

925
00:32:18.688 --> 00:32:24.402
And now Jessica's pineapple
and pancetta pizza.

926
00:32:24.444 --> 00:32:29.491
It's a nice play of what
Americans call Hawaiian.

927
00:32:29.532 --> 00:32:32.660
But I have to be
honest. an Italian chef

928
00:32:32.702 --> 00:32:35.622
would never blasphemy
a pizza with pineapple.

929
00:32:35.663 --> 00:32:36.998
I'm sorry.

930
00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.750
Also. where did you
find the pineapple?

931
00:32:38.792 --> 00:32:41.211
That was not with my
beautiful Italian ingredients

932
00:32:41.252 --> 00:32:42.420
that I offer.

933
00:32:42.462 --> 00:32:44.005
Oh. busted.

934
00:32:44.047 --> 00:32:45.548
[laughter]

935
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:47.634
I snuck it from the fruit
platter we had earlier.

936
00:32:47.676 --> 00:32:50.595
But Hawaiian pizza is
awesome. for the record.

937
00:32:50.637 --> 00:32:51.429
Very sneaky.

938
00:32:51.471 --> 00:32:53.556
[chuckles] What about Amy's?

939
00:32:53.598 --> 00:32:54.516
Have a try.

940
00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:01.940
Hmm.

941
00:33:01.981 --> 00:33:04.067
You used six different toppings.

942
00:33:04.109 --> 00:33:05.777
It's very complex.

943
00:33:05.819 --> 00:33:07.362
You mean it's a mess?

944
00:33:07.404 --> 00:33:12.826
No. I'm saying that it
feels full of contradictions.

945
00:33:12.867 --> 00:33:17.330
But I think contradictions
make a person interesting.

946
00:33:17.372 --> 00:33:20.458
Yes. but we're talking
about pizzas. not people.

947
00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:24.087
But you said to make
her pizzas personal.

948
00:33:24.129 --> 00:33:24.879
Did I say that?

949
00:33:24.921 --> 00:33:25.714
Mm-hmm.

950
00:33:25.755 --> 00:33:27.090
OK.

951
00:33:27.132 --> 00:33:30.427
Well. em. [italian].

952
00:33:30.468 --> 00:33:32.512
Otherwise. it's getting cold.

953
00:33:32.554 --> 00:33:34.806
[laughter]

954
00:33:34.848 --> 00:33:36.474
Have another slice.

955
00:33:36.516 --> 00:33:37.308
Another bite.

956
00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:38.018
OK.

957
00:33:38.059 --> 00:33:39.019
Big bite.

958
00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:39.811
Big one?

959
00:33:39.853 --> 00:33:40.687
OK.

960
00:33:42.897 --> 00:33:44.566
Wow.

961
00:33:44.607 --> 00:33:46.443
Spectacular view.

962
00:33:46.484 --> 00:33:48.028
Mm.

963
00:33:48.069 --> 00:33:48.862
[sighs].

964
00:33:52.282 --> 00:33:54.284
I'm sorry about the pizza.

965
00:33:54.325 --> 00:33:56.411
No. Amy. don't
be sorry about it.

966
00:33:56.453 --> 00:33:58.580
I mean. we are
all here to learn.

967
00:33:58.621 --> 00:33:59.497
No?
- Hmm.

968
00:33:59.539 --> 00:34:01.332
What?

969
00:34:01.374 --> 00:34:03.793
So you've got a very strong
opinions about flavors. which

970
00:34:03.835 --> 00:34:06.463
is quite normal because
you work for a company that

971
00:34:06.504 --> 00:34:07.756
promotes fast food--

972
00:34:07.797 --> 00:34:08.798
It's not fast food.

973
00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.300
[laughs]

974
00:34:10.342 --> 00:34:12.761
It's food for busy people
who want to be healthy.

975
00:34:12.802 --> 00:34:13.762
That's what it's all about.

976
00:34:13.803 --> 00:34:15.388
Mm.

977
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:17.682
Have you ever heard
about the blue zones?

978
00:34:17.724 --> 00:34:19.100
Sure.

979
00:34:19.142 --> 00:34:20.935
They are places where
people live the longest.

980
00:34:20.977 --> 00:34:24.397
And do you know what all
these places have in common?

981
00:34:24.439 --> 00:34:27.817
They pack their health
with scientifically-designed

982
00:34:27.859 --> 00:34:28.818
meal prep kits?

983
00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:32.822
No. just the opposite.

984
00:34:32.864 --> 00:34:34.616
They don't take any
supplements at all.

985
00:34:34.657 --> 00:34:38.870
They have a diet based on fresh.
seasonal fruit. vegetables.

986
00:34:38.912 --> 00:34:43.166
whole grains. pure olive
oils. along with organic meats

987
00:34:43.208 --> 00:34:44.459
and wild seafood.

988
00:34:44.501 --> 00:34:47.420
And this is what
we all should eat.

989
00:34:47.462 --> 00:34:49.923
But you just taught
us to make pizza.

990
00:34:49.964 --> 00:34:52.425
That's not exactly
a health food.

991
00:34:52.467 --> 00:34:53.843
It is.

992
00:34:53.885 --> 00:34:54.886
It is.

993
00:34:54.928 --> 00:34:56.596
OK.

994
00:34:56.638 --> 00:34:59.683
Those pizzas contains all
the minerals and the vitamins

995
00:34:59.724 --> 00:35:01.226
that the body needs.

996
00:35:01.267 --> 00:35:03.103
You're pitching me
pizza as a health food.

997
00:35:03.144 --> 00:35:06.898
I don't think people
will understand that.

998
00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:10.193
I'll tell you what. tomorrow's
going to be our day off.

999
00:35:10.235 --> 00:35:12.112
And I'd like to take
you to the market

1000
00:35:12.153 --> 00:35:15.907
so you will taste what I mean.

1001
00:35:15.949 --> 00:35:17.200
That's kind of you.

1002
00:35:17.242 --> 00:35:18.576
I like that.

1003
00:35:18.618 --> 00:35:21.121
Thank you.

1004
00:35:21.162 --> 00:35:22.163
[chuckles]

1005
00:35:22.205 --> 00:35:25.667
[uplifting music]

1006
00:35:46.521 --> 00:35:48.940
It's going to take a
few seconds. I hope.

1007
00:35:48.982 --> 00:35:51.609
but I have to leave this
bag to a friend of mine.

1008
00:35:51.651 --> 00:35:52.235
OK.

1009
00:35:52.277 --> 00:35:53.862
He works here.

1010
00:35:53.903 --> 00:35:54.904
Lorenzo.

1011
00:35:54.946 --> 00:35:55.905
Hey. Marcello.

1012
00:35:55.947 --> 00:35:58.033
[speaking italian]

1013
00:36:01.494 --> 00:36:02.787
Looks beautiful.

1014
00:36:02.829 --> 00:36:04.039
This is beautiful.

1015
00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:05.206
Grazie. grazie.

1016
00:36:05.248 --> 00:36:07.208
[speaking italian]

1017
00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:08.251
Lorenzo. Amy.

1018
00:36:08.293 --> 00:36:09.210
Amy. Lorenzo.

1019
00:36:09.252 --> 00:36:10.086
Hey. Lorenzo.

1020
00:36:10.128 --> 00:36:11.546
Pleased to meet you.

1021
00:36:11.588 --> 00:36:14.049
Like you say in America.
have a nice day. huh?

1022
00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:15.467
You too.

1023
00:36:15.508 --> 00:36:16.259
Perfecto. Lorenzo.

1024
00:36:16.301 --> 00:36:17.218
Grazie.

1025
00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:18.219
[speaking italian]

1026
00:36:18.261 --> 00:36:20.221
Mm. look at this.

1027
00:36:20.263 --> 00:36:21.598
Mm.

1028
00:36:21.639 --> 00:36:23.516
You know. basil it's
the most important

1029
00:36:23.558 --> 00:36:25.769
herb in the Italian cooking.

1030
00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:26.728
Wow.

1031
00:36:26.770 --> 00:36:28.396
In Roman times.
they used to eat

1032
00:36:28.438 --> 00:36:30.899
the leaves to sweeten
their breath before going

1033
00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:32.400
on a romantic date.

1034
00:36:32.442 --> 00:36:35.070
I never thought of the
Romans as being romantic.

1035
00:36:35.111 --> 00:36:38.073
Where do you think the
word romance comes from?

1036
00:36:38.114 --> 00:36:39.074
- Right.
- Yeah.

1037
00:36:39.115 --> 00:36:39.908
Right.

1038
00:36:39.949 --> 00:36:41.826
Mm-hmm.

1039
00:36:41.868 --> 00:36:43.119
Mm.

1040
00:36:43.161 --> 00:36:44.287
Wow.

1041
00:36:44.329 --> 00:36:45.830
You can almost taste the Earth.

1042
00:36:45.872 --> 00:36:48.249
Mm.

1043
00:36:48.291 --> 00:36:49.501
Lorenzo. grazie.

1044
00:36:49.542 --> 00:36:50.960
[speaking italian]

1045
00:36:51.002 --> 00:36:51.753
Ciao.

1046
00:36:51.795 --> 00:36:52.629
Ciao.

1047
00:36:55.048 --> 00:36:57.425
I don't see a ring.

1048
00:36:57.467 --> 00:36:58.677
So you're not married?

1049
00:36:58.718 --> 00:36:59.594
No.

1050
00:36:59.636 --> 00:37:02.138
OK. you probably
have a boyfriend

1051
00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:03.807
waiting for you at home. no?

1052
00:37:03.848 --> 00:37:05.433
Is that a
professional question?

1053
00:37:05.475 --> 00:37:09.562
Nah. it's just a normal
conversation. nothing more.

1054
00:37:09.604 --> 00:37:12.107
I was seeing
someone for a while.

1055
00:37:12.148 --> 00:37:13.650
A chef. actually.

1056
00:37:13.692 --> 00:37:14.401
Italian?

1057
00:37:14.442 --> 00:37:15.276
No.

1058
00:37:15.318 --> 00:37:16.569
No. German.

1059
00:37:16.611 --> 00:37:17.946
But it didn't work out.

1060
00:37:17.987 --> 00:37:22.283
Yeah. well. German
chefs make bad husbands.

1061
00:37:22.325 --> 00:37:23.076
Oh. really?

1062
00:37:23.118 --> 00:37:23.993
Mm-hmm.

1063
00:37:24.035 --> 00:37:25.036
Oh. how do you know?

1064
00:37:25.078 --> 00:37:26.162
Were you married to one?

1065
00:37:26.204 --> 00:37:28.665
[laughs] No.

1066
00:37:28.707 --> 00:37:32.168
But they always shout and
throw things in the kitchen.

1067
00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:33.086
It's a mess.

1068
00:37:33.128 --> 00:37:34.504
Isn't that all chefs?

1069
00:37:34.546 --> 00:37:37.966
No. we are famous
for short tempers.

1070
00:37:38.008 --> 00:37:38.675
Even you?

1071
00:37:38.717 --> 00:37:40.593
I can't imagine that.

1072
00:37:40.635 --> 00:37:42.637
When I had my
restaurant in New York.

1073
00:37:42.679 --> 00:37:44.305
my girlfriend used
to complain that I

1074
00:37:44.347 --> 00:37:46.683
was stressed out and angry.

1075
00:37:46.725 --> 00:37:51.688
But now. I'm more
relaxed. more myself.

1076
00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:54.232
So your girlfriend didn't
want to come back to Venice

1077
00:37:54.274 --> 00:37:56.151
with you?

1078
00:37:56.192 --> 00:37:59.195
The moment I quit the
restaurant. she just dumped me.

1079
00:37:59.237 --> 00:38:00.530
Wow.

1080
00:38:00.572 --> 00:38:02.198
I believe she was
more in love with

1081
00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:05.201
the idea of dating
an award-winning

1082
00:38:05.243 --> 00:38:07.954
chef rather than me.

1083
00:38:07.996 --> 00:38:10.707
Well. for the record.
I think the Venice

1084
00:38:10.749 --> 00:38:12.917
Marcello is pretty great.

1085
00:38:12.959 --> 00:38:14.127
Thank you.

1086
00:38:14.169 --> 00:38:15.462
You're not bad yourself.

1087
00:38:15.503 --> 00:38:18.506
[laughs] Not bad.

1088
00:38:18.548 --> 00:38:20.133
Is this how you
say in English. no?

1089
00:38:20.175 --> 00:38:21.384
Yeah. yeah. that's fine.

1090
00:38:21.426 --> 00:38:23.345
I know.

1091
00:38:23.386 --> 00:38:24.346
Your pizza's still awful.

1092
00:38:24.387 --> 00:38:25.180
Hey!

1093
00:38:25.221 --> 00:38:26.056
[laughter]

1094
00:38:26.097 --> 00:38:29.893
[uplifting music]

1095
00:38:32.228 --> 00:38:34.939
Ice cream tastes better
here than in America.

1096
00:38:34.981 --> 00:38:39.235
Obviously. in Italy.
everything is better.

1097
00:38:39.277 --> 00:38:40.737
And it's called gelato.

1098
00:38:40.779 --> 00:38:42.405
Gelato.

1099
00:38:42.447 --> 00:38:44.449
Yeah.

1100
00:38:44.491 --> 00:38:47.535
It feels like everybody
here is born to cook.

1101
00:38:47.577 --> 00:38:49.412
Nobody's born a great cook.

1102
00:38:49.454 --> 00:38:52.832
I believe you learn by doing.

1103
00:38:52.874 --> 00:38:54.125
Hmm.

1104
00:38:54.167 --> 00:38:56.836
And you could share your
talents and philosophy

1105
00:38:56.878 --> 00:38:59.714
of food with the whole world.

1106
00:38:59.756 --> 00:39:01.841
You're talking about
those prep meals?

1107
00:39:01.883 --> 00:39:03.051
Mm-hmm.

1108
00:39:03.093 --> 00:39:05.303
If I have to create
a kit for Blossom--

1109
00:39:05.345 --> 00:39:07.013
Mm-hmm.

1110
00:39:07.055 --> 00:39:09.391
--I would make
something for families.

1111
00:39:09.432 --> 00:39:10.892
not just for individuals.

1112
00:39:10.934 --> 00:39:14.062
Yeah. but not everybody
wants to make big meals.

1113
00:39:14.104 --> 00:39:18.858
Many of our customers are
single professionals like me.

1114
00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:20.944
But the point is. if
you cook for the ones

1115
00:39:20.985 --> 00:39:25.115
you love. with
love. you have it.

1116
00:39:25.156 --> 00:39:26.199
Know what I mean?

1117
00:39:26.241 --> 00:39:28.827
Mm-hmm.

1118
00:39:28.868 --> 00:39:33.289
Which reminds
me that I've been

1119
00:39:33.331 --> 00:39:35.125
thinking about your problem.

1120
00:39:35.166 --> 00:39:36.543
My problem?

1121
00:39:36.584 --> 00:39:38.837
What's my problem?

1122
00:39:38.878 --> 00:39:40.505
Your problem in the kitchen.

1123
00:39:40.547 --> 00:39:42.090
OK.

1124
00:39:42.132 --> 00:39:44.134
You may have talent for
cooking. but for some reason

1125
00:39:44.175 --> 00:39:48.722
you overcomplicate something
that could be so simple.

1126
00:39:48.763 --> 00:39:51.766
I just want to make
everything the best.

1127
00:39:51.808 --> 00:39:55.270
Listen. Amy. good food is
not about being the best.

1128
00:39:55.311 --> 00:39:57.480
You know?

1129
00:39:57.522 --> 00:40:01.609
Your heart knows what
smells. what tastes.

1130
00:40:01.651 --> 00:40:03.028
and what looks good.

1131
00:40:03.069 --> 00:40:04.779
Mm-hmm.

1132
00:40:04.821 --> 00:40:06.031
You have to be relaxed--

1133
00:40:06.072 --> 00:40:07.907
- OK.
- --follow your instincts--

1134
00:40:07.949 --> 00:40:08.575
Mm-hmm.

1135
00:40:08.616 --> 00:40:09.826
--an it will be.

1136
00:40:09.868 --> 00:40:11.828
I promise that it will be.

1137
00:40:17.125 --> 00:40:18.585
Have you finished
with the gelato?

1138
00:40:18.626 --> 00:40:20.086
Mm-hmm.

1139
00:40:20.128 --> 00:40:22.088
OK. because I'm going
to show you what I mean.

1140
00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:22.964
OK.

1141
00:40:23.006 --> 00:40:24.090
So let's go.

1142
00:40:24.132 --> 00:40:27.010
[gentle music]

1143
00:40:27.844 --> 00:40:30.513
Wow.

1144
00:40:30.555 --> 00:40:33.183
Yeah. well. this is
my father's restaurant.

1145
00:40:33.224 --> 00:40:35.935
I practically grew
up in the kitchen.

1146
00:40:35.977 --> 00:40:37.687
Do you bring a lot
of students here?

1147
00:40:40.273 --> 00:40:42.275
No.

1148
00:40:42.317 --> 00:40:43.318
Not into the kitchen.

1149
00:40:51.409 --> 00:40:54.120
Here we are.

1150
00:40:54.162 --> 00:40:56.998
My father changes his
menu every single day

1151
00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.959
based on what fresh food
he finds at the market.

1152
00:41:00.001 --> 00:41:06.341
But no matter what. he
always makes his own pasta.

1153
00:41:06.383 --> 00:41:07.175
Oh.

1154
00:41:11.054 --> 00:41:11.846
I love pasta.

1155
00:41:14.557 --> 00:41:15.892
You know how to do it. no?

1156
00:41:15.934 --> 00:41:17.519
Yeah. yeah. I can do this.

1157
00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:18.478
[chuckles]

1158
00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:19.938
That's good. Amy.

1159
00:41:19.979 --> 00:41:21.439
Because love is always
the right place to start.

1160
00:41:24.192 --> 00:41:26.528
OK.

1161
00:41:26.569 --> 00:41:27.696
Here we are.

1162
00:41:27.737 --> 00:41:29.030
Here we are.

1163
00:41:29.072 --> 00:41:29.906
All right. so--

1164
00:41:29.948 --> 00:41:31.074
I don't want to see that.

1165
00:41:31.116 --> 00:41:31.866
OK.

1166
00:41:31.908 --> 00:41:32.867
Just try to focus. no?

1167
00:41:32.909 --> 00:41:34.035
Italians. we do this.

1168
00:41:34.077 --> 00:41:34.828
[laughs]

1169
00:41:34.869 --> 00:41:36.371
So you can use this. no?

1170
00:41:36.413 --> 00:41:37.747
OK.
[laughter]

1171
00:41:37.789 --> 00:41:38.581
Like this?

1172
00:41:38.623 --> 00:41:40.000
All the fingers.

1173
00:41:40.041 --> 00:41:40.583
Like this.

1174
00:41:40.625 --> 00:41:41.584
OK. OK.

1175
00:41:41.626 --> 00:41:42.836
Yeah.

1176
00:41:42.877 --> 00:41:43.962
You're watching
me. I can't do it.

1177
00:41:44.004 --> 00:41:44.671
OK.

1178
00:41:44.713 --> 00:41:46.589
[singing in italian]

1179
00:41:46.631 --> 00:41:48.299
[laughs]

1180
00:41:48.341 --> 00:41:49.175
No. no. no. no. no.

1181
00:41:49.217 --> 00:41:51.720
Ugh.

1182
00:41:51.761 --> 00:41:54.264
[singing in italian]

1183
00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:56.808
[laughs]

1184
00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:08.236
Bellissima.

1185
00:42:08.278 --> 00:42:09.446
[laughs]

1186
00:42:09.487 --> 00:42:10.780
And then you do this. right?

1187
00:42:13.867 --> 00:42:15.076
Now cut it.

1188
00:42:15.118 --> 00:42:17.203
You cut it.

1189
00:42:17.245 --> 00:42:20.915
[singing in italian]

1190
00:42:27.881 --> 00:42:31.426
[gasps] That's beautiful.

1191
00:42:31.468 --> 00:42:32.260
Perfecto.

1192
00:42:35.638 --> 00:42:37.057
Some pepper.

1193
00:42:37.098 --> 00:42:37.766
Yeah.

1194
00:42:37.807 --> 00:42:38.933
[chuckles]

1195
00:42:41.353 --> 00:42:42.270
[sighs] Mangia.

1196
00:42:45.148 --> 00:42:46.358
Mm.

1197
00:42:46.399 --> 00:42:47.817
Wow.

1198
00:42:47.859 --> 00:42:49.486
I can't believe I
helped make this.

1199
00:42:49.527 --> 00:42:50.570
Mm.

1200
00:42:50.612 --> 00:42:53.073
You did a great job.

1201
00:42:53.114 --> 00:42:55.033
It's such a pleasure
to see my son

1202
00:42:55.075 --> 00:42:57.077
in the kitchen with a woman.

1203
00:42:57.118 --> 00:42:58.661
Mama.

1204
00:42:58.703 --> 00:43:00.872
It's delicious.

1205
00:43:00.914 --> 00:43:03.083
You can serve it tonight.

1206
00:43:03.124 --> 00:43:03.667
Mm.

1207
00:43:03.708 --> 00:43:05.627
Really?

1208
00:43:05.669 --> 00:43:07.420
Here at the restaurant?

1209
00:43:07.462 --> 00:43:09.005
Yeah.

1210
00:43:09.047 --> 00:43:13.218
Maybe it needs a little
saffron. but it's very good.

1211
00:43:13.259 --> 00:43:15.387
[speaking italian]

1212
00:43:15.428 --> 00:43:19.474
I mean. it's quite rare that my
father allows one of my dishes

1213
00:43:19.516 --> 00:43:20.684
on the menu.

1214
00:43:20.725 --> 00:43:22.644
It's not just your dish.

1215
00:43:22.686 --> 00:43:24.437
It was a collaboration. no?

1216
00:43:24.479 --> 00:43:25.313
Yeah.

1217
00:43:25.355 --> 00:43:26.064
[chuckles]

1218
00:43:26.106 --> 00:43:27.816
You make a great team.

1219
00:43:27.857 --> 00:43:29.317
To teamwork.

1220
00:43:29.359 --> 00:43:30.485
Teamwork.

1221
00:43:30.527 --> 00:43:31.361
OK.

1222
00:43:31.403 --> 00:43:32.654
[glasses clinking]

1223
00:43:32.696 --> 00:43:34.823
Oh.

1224
00:43:34.864 --> 00:43:37.200
[chuckling]

1225
00:43:41.287 --> 00:43:44.624
[upbeat music]

1226
00:44:00.974 --> 00:44:05.103
[phone ringing]

1227
00:44:06.938 --> 00:44:08.815
Naomi. hi.

1228
00:44:08.857 --> 00:44:10.567
Have you signed him yet?

1229
00:44:10.608 --> 00:44:11.943
Not yet.

1230
00:44:11.985 --> 00:44:13.820
Not officially. but
he's coming around.

1231
00:44:13.862 --> 00:44:17.407
I'm close. but he had a bad
experience at his restaurant

1232
00:44:17.449 --> 00:44:18.283
in New York.

1233
00:44:18.324 --> 00:44:19.492
Meaning?

1234
00:44:19.534 --> 00:44:22.037
I might need to stay
for the whole course.

1235
00:44:22.078 --> 00:44:25.457
Listen. Amy. you've
already been there a week.

1236
00:44:25.498 --> 00:44:28.710
I need you back at
work and I need a chef.

1237
00:44:28.752 --> 00:44:30.462
I won't wait forever.

1238
00:44:30.503 --> 00:44:34.966
Close the deal and
get back here. hmm?

1239
00:44:35.008 --> 00:44:36.134
[phone beeps]

1240
00:44:36.968 --> 00:44:38.094
[exhales]

1241
00:44:39.929 --> 00:44:41.431
Hey. may I join you?

1242
00:44:41.473 --> 00:44:42.390
Yes. please.

1243
00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:48.313
You look deep in thought.

1244
00:44:48.355 --> 00:44:51.483
Mm. contemplating
my future at work.

1245
00:44:51.524 --> 00:44:54.069
It looks like things are going
great with wooing Marcello.

1246
00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:55.570
Not wooing.

1247
00:44:55.612 --> 00:44:56.738
Could have fooled me.

1248
00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:58.448
Oh. I'm just
really under the gun.

1249
00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:01.409
I don't know what I can
do to get him to say yes.

1250
00:45:01.451 --> 00:45:03.661
If he's flip flopping.
it's probably not about you.

1251
00:45:03.703 --> 00:45:05.914
I mean. you can't control
other people's decisions.

1252
00:45:05.955 --> 00:45:07.665
I don't want to
control his decision.

1253
00:45:07.707 --> 00:45:10.168
but I don't want to lose my job.

1254
00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:11.753
Well. that's crazy.

1255
00:45:11.795 --> 00:45:14.130
If you lose your job over
something you can't control.

1256
00:45:14.172 --> 00:45:15.674
maybe it's not the job for you.

1257
00:45:20.762 --> 00:45:22.222
- Ooh.
- Mm.

1258
00:45:22.263 --> 00:45:24.015
- Mm. that smells delicious.
- Don't look at it.

1259
00:45:24.057 --> 00:45:24.849
It's not the moment.

1260
00:45:24.891 --> 00:45:26.184
Go to the stations.

1261
00:45:26.226 --> 00:45:27.268
Immediately.
- Mm-hmm.

1262
00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:28.103
OK.

1263
00:45:30.397 --> 00:45:31.856
Hey.

1264
00:45:31.898 --> 00:45:35.026
So now. today. I'd like to
make a twist on my Venetian

1265
00:45:35.068 --> 00:45:36.903
duck ragu with bigoli.

1266
00:45:36.945 --> 00:45:40.365
As you can see. it's
a thicker pasta. huh?

1267
00:45:40.407 --> 00:45:42.659
Very common in this region.

1268
00:45:42.701 --> 00:45:43.535
Yeah.

1269
00:45:43.576 --> 00:45:44.828
Yeah. wow.

1270
00:45:44.869 --> 00:45:46.996
OK now you can
taste it if you like.

1271
00:45:47.038 --> 00:45:48.581
BRADFORD: Oh.

1272
00:45:48.623 --> 00:45:49.582
Use your hands.

1273
00:45:49.624 --> 00:45:51.876
Don't be afraid.

1274
00:45:51.918 --> 00:45:52.877
OLIVIA: Delicioso.

1275
00:45:52.919 --> 00:45:55.213
[chuckles] Here you are.

1276
00:45:55.255 --> 00:45:56.631
I'll take a little one.

1277
00:45:56.673 --> 00:45:57.757
I'm going to take a big one.

1278
00:46:00.552 --> 00:46:01.386
Wow.

1279
00:46:01.428 --> 00:46:03.847
OLIVIA: Whoops.

1280
00:46:03.888 --> 00:46:09.227
My goal today is to inspire
and encourage you to experiment

1281
00:46:09.269 --> 00:46:12.731
with whatever flavors
you wish to use in making

1282
00:46:12.772 --> 00:46:14.733
your twist on this dish. OK?

1283
00:46:14.774 --> 00:46:15.775
Perfecto.

1284
00:46:15.817 --> 00:46:17.193
I'm going to leave it here.

1285
00:46:17.235 --> 00:46:18.278
I have to clean everything.

1286
00:46:18.319 --> 00:46:19.571
So you've got time.

1287
00:46:19.612 --> 00:46:20.363
[upbeat music]

1288
00:46:20.405 --> 00:46:21.573
Hey!

1289
00:46:21.614 --> 00:46:23.616
[chuckles]

1290
00:46:23.658 --> 00:46:24.534
Oh!

1291
00:46:24.576 --> 00:46:25.326
Oh my gosh.

1292
00:46:25.368 --> 00:46:26.494
Look at all that oil.

1293
00:46:26.536 --> 00:46:28.913
[speaking italian]

1294
00:46:28.955 --> 00:46:30.290
OK. I'm thinking the garlic.

1295
00:46:30.331 --> 00:46:31.249
Yeah.

1296
00:46:31.291 --> 00:46:32.334
- The garlic is so good.
- Yeah.

1297
00:46:32.375 --> 00:46:33.752
You can't go wrong with it.

1298
00:46:33.793 --> 00:46:34.669
OK.

1299
00:46:34.711 --> 00:46:36.796
[singing in italian]

1300
00:46:42.344 --> 00:46:43.053
[laughs]

1301
00:46:43.094 --> 00:46:46.264
[sizzling]

1302
00:46:56.941 --> 00:46:57.817
[italian]

1303
00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:02.113
You're getting
really good at this.

1304
00:47:02.155 --> 00:47:03.990
I had a little
refresher yesterday.

1305
00:47:04.032 --> 00:47:04.949
What?

1306
00:47:04.991 --> 00:47:06.868
A lesson with Marcello.

1307
00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:08.119
Ooh. a private lesson?

1308
00:47:08.161 --> 00:47:09.579
I was wondering where you were.

1309
00:47:09.621 --> 00:47:13.625
It was just to keep
up with all of you.

1310
00:47:13.667 --> 00:47:14.626
Good?

1311
00:47:14.668 --> 00:47:15.835
Whoa.

1312
00:47:15.877 --> 00:47:16.795
Well. whatever it
was. it worked.

1313
00:47:16.836 --> 00:47:18.296
This is amazing.

1314
00:47:21.007 --> 00:47:23.051
[speaking italian]

1315
00:47:23.093 --> 00:47:25.679
Let's see what you
have made for me.

1316
00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:31.768
We have made a Asian-Italian
spicy duck on bigoli noodles.

1317
00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:34.979
BRADFORD: Ah. with plenty
of ginger and garlic.

1318
00:47:35.021 --> 00:47:38.274
It looks very nice.

1319
00:47:38.316 --> 00:47:42.362
[gentle music]

1320
00:47:50.704 --> 00:47:52.706
Oh.

1321
00:47:52.747 --> 00:47:54.582
[speaking italian]

1322
00:47:56.751 --> 00:47:59.129
I've never tasted a duck
dish quite like this.

1323
00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:00.922
Excellent.

1324
00:48:00.964 --> 00:48:02.173
That's amazing.

1325
00:48:02.215 --> 00:48:03.174
Thanks. chef.

1326
00:48:03.216 --> 00:48:04.134
Give me five.

1327
00:48:04.175 --> 00:48:05.677
Fantastico.

1328
00:48:05.719 --> 00:48:07.137
That's something.

1329
00:48:07.178 --> 00:48:08.847
[italian]

1330
00:48:08.888 --> 00:48:11.349
We also made a spin on the
traditional Venetian duck ragu.

1331
00:48:11.391 --> 00:48:14.352
Instead of a ragu. we
made a duck confit.

1332
00:48:14.394 --> 00:48:17.063
And we've used saffron
to infuse the bigoli.

1333
00:48:17.105 --> 00:48:18.189
Saffron?

1334
00:48:18.231 --> 00:48:19.441
What a marvelous choice.

1335
00:48:33.371 --> 00:48:35.707
The duck confit is impressive.

1336
00:48:35.749 --> 00:48:36.583
Well done.

1337
00:48:42.881 --> 00:48:45.884
I'm not sure the saffron
quite works with this dish.

1338
00:48:45.925 --> 00:48:47.844
but I appreciate the experiment.

1339
00:48:47.886 --> 00:48:48.887
Bravo.

1340
00:48:48.928 --> 00:48:49.721
Thanks. chef.

1341
00:48:49.763 --> 00:48:50.430
Thanks.

1342
00:48:50.472 --> 00:48:51.556
You should be proud.

1343
00:48:51.598 --> 00:48:52.182
Marcello?

1344
00:48:52.223 --> 00:48:53.391
[italian]

1345
00:48:53.433 --> 00:48:55.518
Can I get five
minutes to continue

1346
00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:58.688
our conversation about Blossom?

1347
00:48:58.730 --> 00:49:00.231
Si.

1348
00:49:00.273 --> 00:49:03.276
I have to meet my
parents. but then I'm

1349
00:49:03.318 --> 00:49:05.278
going to take you all
to the island of Murano

1350
00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:06.237
in the afternoon.

1351
00:49:06.279 --> 00:49:07.113
So we can talk there.

1352
00:49:07.155 --> 00:49:08.031
Perfect.

1353
00:49:08.073 --> 00:49:08.907
[italian]

1354
00:49:08.948 --> 00:49:09.949

[singing in italian]

1356
00:49:27.175 --> 00:49:28.968
Oh. wow.

1357
00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:29.969
Oh my gosh.

1358
00:49:30.011 --> 00:49:32.555
[singing in italian]

1359
00:49:38.812 --> 00:49:44.025
It takes 1.200 degrees to
make the famous clear glass.

1360
00:49:44.067 --> 00:49:45.735
Wow. that's really hot.

1361
00:49:45.777 --> 00:49:47.445
My colleague
then takes his kana

1362
00:49:47.487 --> 00:49:50.532
and then he blows through
the pipe and twists.

1363
00:49:50.573 --> 00:49:53.284
And this over here. guys.
is the final product.

1364
00:49:53.326 --> 00:49:54.786
BRADFORD: Wow.

1365
00:49:54.828 --> 00:49:56.621
What a thing of beauty.

1366
00:49:56.663 --> 00:50:00.166
But it's nothing compared
to your beauty. Olivia.

1367
00:50:00.208 --> 00:50:02.794
Bradford. you're such a flirt.

1368
00:50:02.836 --> 00:50:05.505
I guess Italy must
be rubbing off on me.

1369
00:50:05.547 --> 00:50:08.925
Oh. I'm surprised to
find that I quite like it.

1370
00:50:08.967 --> 00:50:12.387
[gentle music]

1371
00:50:15.557 --> 00:50:17.517
[clears throat] Excuse me.

1372
00:50:17.559 --> 00:50:19.019
I leave you with Jessica.

1373
00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:21.271
Have a seat.

1374
00:50:21.312 --> 00:50:23.732
Who knew that Bradford
has a romantic side?

1375
00:50:23.773 --> 00:50:25.608
Well. they do say
Italy is the most

1376
00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:27.652
romantic country in the world.

1377
00:50:27.694 --> 00:50:28.486
Who said that?

1378
00:50:28.528 --> 00:50:29.988
[laughs] I don't know.

1379
00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:31.948
Everyone.

1380
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:35.160
It was really nice of your dad
to put our dish on the menu.

1381
00:50:35.201 --> 00:50:36.786
I've never had a
dish on any menu.

1382
00:50:36.828 --> 00:50:38.663
Just wait until
you become a chef.

1383
00:50:38.705 --> 00:50:39.247
[laughs] Me?

1384
00:50:39.289 --> 00:50:40.206
No.

1385
00:50:40.248 --> 00:50:42.292
No. I don't think so.

1386
00:50:42.334 --> 00:50:44.336
I think we make a great team.

1387
00:50:44.377 --> 00:50:47.797
Come to New York
and try it at least.

1388
00:50:47.839 --> 00:50:49.549
I haven't agreed to
go back to New York

1389
00:50:49.591 --> 00:50:50.884
to do this for you. Amy--

1390
00:50:50.925 --> 00:50:51.885
Not for me.

1391
00:50:51.926 --> 00:50:53.595
With me.

1392
00:50:53.636 --> 00:50:55.180
And you're warming
up to the idea.

1393
00:50:55.221 --> 00:50:56.014
I can feel it.

1394
00:51:00.226 --> 00:51:01.978
But now I live
here and I'm happy--

1395
00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:02.937
I know.

1396
00:51:02.979 --> 00:51:05.357
I know. but it--

1397
00:51:05.398 --> 00:51:07.567
So why would I leave Italy?

1398
00:51:07.609 --> 00:51:08.193
Mm-hmm.

1399
00:51:08.234 --> 00:51:09.194
Huh?

1400
00:51:09.235 --> 00:51:10.236
Honestly. I don't know.

1401
00:51:10.278 --> 00:51:13.907
This place is perfect.

1402
00:51:13.948 --> 00:51:14.908
Oh my goodness. of course.

1403
00:51:14.949 --> 00:51:15.700
That's it.

1404
00:51:15.742 --> 00:51:16.951
What?

1405
00:51:16.993 --> 00:51:18.703
Well. there's no reason
for you to leave Italy.

1406
00:51:18.745 --> 00:51:21.081
You could curate the recipes
right here in Venice.

1407
00:51:21.122 --> 00:51:23.625
I mean. we can make them
exactly how you want them to be.

1408
00:51:23.667 --> 00:51:25.210
Mm.

1409
00:51:25.251 --> 00:51:27.170
We could shoot instructional
videos from your cooking school

1410
00:51:27.212 --> 00:51:29.881
or put a QR code on the box
that links to a live stream.

1411
00:51:29.923 --> 00:51:31.383
What do you think?

1412
00:51:31.424 --> 00:51:33.927
[clears throat] You're
very pushy. you know that?

1413
00:51:33.968 --> 00:51:37.931
Take that as a compliment.

1414
00:51:43.353 --> 00:51:46.898
[gentle music]

1415
00:51:48.358 --> 00:51:50.443
Ah. bonjourno. Amy.

1416
00:51:50.485 --> 00:51:51.736
AMY: Hey.

1417
00:51:51.778 --> 00:51:53.697
You look from a
painting. sitting there

1418
00:51:53.738 --> 00:51:55.657
with that mysterious smile.

1419
00:51:55.699 --> 00:51:58.159
You caught me
admiring the view.

1420
00:51:58.201 --> 00:52:03.331
I'm thinking this is a really
spectacular place to think.

1421
00:52:03.373 --> 00:52:04.249
May I?

1422
00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:05.250
AMY: Of course. please.

1423
00:52:05.291 --> 00:52:07.377
Join me in my painting.

1424
00:52:07.419 --> 00:52:13.508
[chuckles] Ah. I
never tire of this.

1425
00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:14.467
Who would?

1426
00:52:14.509 --> 00:52:15.885
[sighs]

1427
00:52:16.636 --> 00:52:19.180
I know that smile.

1428
00:52:19.222 --> 00:52:20.098
Oh?

1429
00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:21.391
Mm.

1430
00:52:21.433 --> 00:52:23.518
That is not the
smile of a thinker.

1431
00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:25.729
That is a smile of a lover.

1432
00:52:25.770 --> 00:52:27.313
What?

1433
00:52:27.355 --> 00:52:31.693
No. Caterina if you mean a
lover of work. of someone trying

1434
00:52:31.735 --> 00:52:33.862
to figure out how to
coax your talented son

1435
00:52:33.903 --> 00:52:35.864
into working with me. then yes.

1436
00:52:35.905 --> 00:52:40.368
This is the smile of a lover.

1437
00:52:40.410 --> 00:52:42.579
Mm.

1438
00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:46.666
You know. young lady.
flowers should be enjoyed

1439
00:52:46.708 --> 00:52:48.960
while they are in bloom.

1440
00:52:49.002 --> 00:52:50.545
Time flies.

1441
00:52:50.587 --> 00:52:53.423
Seasons pass.

1442
00:52:53.465 --> 00:52:56.926
And before you know it. winter.

1443
00:53:00.472 --> 00:53:02.098
That sounds like
something my dad would say.

1444
00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:04.768
[chuckles] Parents
are always right.

1445
00:53:04.809 --> 00:53:07.062
And they know everything.

1446
00:53:17.405 --> 00:53:18.573
Thank you.

1447
00:53:18.615 --> 00:53:19.366
Buona giornata.

1448
00:53:26.122 --> 00:53:27.123
Hey. thank you.

1449
00:53:27.165 --> 00:53:28.458
You come back again here.

1450
00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:31.878
[phone ringing]

1451
00:53:33.213 --> 00:53:34.005
Amy?

1452
00:53:34.047 --> 00:53:35.590
Hey. Dad.

1453
00:53:35.632 --> 00:53:36.424
AMY'S DAD (ON PHONE):
Everything all right. honey?

1454
00:53:36.466 --> 00:53:37.509
Yeah. yeah. I'm good.

1455
00:53:37.550 --> 00:53:38.635
I just wanted to
hear your voice.

1456
00:53:38.677 --> 00:53:40.261
Oh. that's so sweet.

1457
00:53:40.303 --> 00:53:41.346
AMY (ON PHONE): I miss you.

1458
00:53:41.388 --> 00:53:44.057
Hey. I miss you too. baby.

1459
00:53:44.099 --> 00:53:45.975
But I hope you're having
a good time out there.

1460
00:53:46.017 --> 00:53:48.436
Actually. I'm having
a really great time.

1461
00:53:48.478 --> 00:53:50.438
I'm learning a lot about Italy.

1462
00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:51.731
It's gorgeous here.

1463
00:53:51.773 --> 00:53:52.857
Oh. that's wonderful.

1464
00:53:52.899 --> 00:53:54.609
And how's that Marcello fella?

1465
00:53:54.651 --> 00:53:55.860
How's he doing?

1466
00:53:55.902 --> 00:53:57.987
Yeah. it turns out I like him.

1467
00:53:58.029 --> 00:54:01.449
You like like him
or you like him?

1468
00:54:01.491 --> 00:54:02.617
Dad. stop.

1469
00:54:02.659 --> 00:54:04.411
No. you stop.

1470
00:54:04.452 --> 00:54:07.747
You know. I don't know what it
is. but. uh. you seem relaxed.

1471
00:54:07.789 --> 00:54:10.500
You sound happy.

1472
00:54:10.542 --> 00:54:13.586
It seems this time in Italy is
something you needed. kiddo.

1473
00:54:13.628 --> 00:54:16.756
Yeah. yeah. maybe it is.

1474
00:54:16.798 --> 00:54:19.050
Uh. honey. I got a customer.

1475
00:54:19.092 --> 00:54:19.634
I got to go.

1476
00:54:19.676 --> 00:54:21.594
OK. I love you.

1477
00:54:21.636 --> 00:54:22.595
I love you too. baby.

1478
00:54:22.637 --> 00:54:23.388
Bye.

1479
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:25.098
Ciao.

1480
00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:26.391
[phone beeps]

1481
00:54:26.433 --> 00:54:30.311
[gentle music]

1482
00:54:33.648 --> 00:54:34.733
Signorina.

1483
00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:38.528
Hey. signorina. bongiorno.

1484
00:54:38.570 --> 00:54:39.654
No. thank you.

1485
00:54:39.696 --> 00:54:41.489
I'm waiting for someone.

1486
00:54:41.531 --> 00:54:43.283
Amy.

1487
00:54:43.324 --> 00:54:44.534
It's me.

1488
00:54:44.576 --> 00:54:45.452
What?

1489
00:54:45.493 --> 00:54:46.661
[chuckles]

1490
00:54:46.703 --> 00:54:48.872
We're going on
a gondola. really?

1491
00:54:48.913 --> 00:54:52.500
When in Venice. right?

1492
00:54:52.542 --> 00:54:55.754
Oh. actually. can you keep
us out of the water this time?

1493
00:54:55.795 --> 00:54:57.005
[speaking italian]

1494
00:54:57.047 --> 00:54:59.090
That was your fault. not mine.

1495
00:54:59.132 --> 00:55:00.342
Oh. yeah.

1496
00:55:00.383 --> 00:55:01.676
Yeah. I remember.

1497
00:55:01.718 --> 00:55:04.679
"Idiot tourist." wasn't it?

1498
00:55:04.721 --> 00:55:06.181
I deserved that.

1499
00:55:06.222 --> 00:55:08.850
Are you willing to give
me another chance. please?

1500
00:55:12.604 --> 00:55:13.646
Grazie.

1501
00:55:13.688 --> 00:55:14.481
Prego.

1502
00:55:17.692 --> 00:55:18.526
Whoa.

1503
00:55:18.568 --> 00:55:19.361
Whoa.

1504
00:55:19.402 --> 00:55:20.362
[chuckles]

1505
00:55:20.403 --> 00:55:22.781
[speaking italian]

1506
00:55:24.366 --> 00:55:25.700
Are you feeling the sickness?

1507
00:55:25.742 --> 00:55:27.035
A little bit?
- A little.

1508
00:55:27.077 --> 00:55:27.869
Yeah?

1509
00:55:30.622 --> 00:55:32.290
It's a beautiful boat.

1510
00:55:32.332 --> 00:55:36.086
[gentle music]

1511
00:55:39.381 --> 00:55:42.300
I can't believe how
gorgeous everything is here.

1512
00:55:42.342 --> 00:55:45.303
The sights. the smells.
and of course. the food.

1513
00:55:45.345 --> 00:55:46.471
They've all been incredible.

1514
00:55:46.513 --> 00:55:48.056
What about the people?

1515
00:55:48.098 --> 00:55:51.393
[laughs] Yeah. the people
have been pretty nice too.

1516
00:55:51.434 --> 00:55:53.019
[chuckling]

1517
00:55:53.770 --> 00:55:54.604
I don't know.

1518
00:55:54.646 --> 00:55:55.855
I don't know what it is.

1519
00:55:55.897 --> 00:55:58.858
It's just-- I feel
so alive here.

1520
00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:00.902
Yeah. well. I feel the same.

1521
00:56:00.944 --> 00:56:03.321
That's why I moved back home.

1522
00:56:03.363 --> 00:56:06.074
Yeah. I can understand that.

1523
00:56:06.116 --> 00:56:08.702
I just feel like I'm
seeing the world in a way

1524
00:56:08.743 --> 00:56:10.620
that I didn't before.

1525
00:56:10.662 --> 00:56:12.706
You know?

1526
00:56:12.747 --> 00:56:13.998
I'm sorry.

1527
00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:15.500
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

1528
00:56:15.542 --> 00:56:17.585
Amy. there's nothing
wrong with you.

1529
00:56:17.627 --> 00:56:20.422
Venice is a magical place.

1530
00:56:20.463 --> 00:56:22.549
[italian]

1531
00:56:22.590 --> 00:56:23.425
Hmm.

1532
00:56:23.466 --> 00:56:24.426
Life is beautiful.

1533
00:56:24.467 --> 00:56:26.302
[speaking italian]

1534
00:56:28.596 --> 00:56:32.559
So may I ask you a
personal question?

1535
00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:34.269
Of course.

1536
00:56:34.310 --> 00:56:38.314
You are a beautiful. strong.
intelligent. and sensitive

1537
00:56:38.356 --> 00:56:39.649
woman--

1538
00:56:39.691 --> 00:56:43.403
Thank you. but
that's not a question.

1539
00:56:43.445 --> 00:56:46.781
Why do you choose to be alone?

1540
00:56:46.823 --> 00:56:48.908
I don't choose to be alone.

1541
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:52.787
I think I've just always
chosen a successful career

1542
00:56:52.829 --> 00:56:54.664
over a personal life.

1543
00:56:54.706 --> 00:56:56.624
And plus. it's
really busy at work.

1544
00:56:56.666 --> 00:56:58.835
so it's hard to meet people.

1545
00:56:58.877 --> 00:57:01.004
Too busy for love?

1546
00:57:01.046 --> 00:57:04.966
I don't have time for a
relationship right now. so--

1547
00:57:05.008 --> 00:57:07.218
But if it's not
now. then when?

1548
00:57:10.472 --> 00:57:13.350
I can't believe I
just rode on a gondola.

1549
00:57:13.391 --> 00:57:14.976
[chuckles]

1550
00:57:15.018 --> 00:57:19.064
Yeah. if you lived here.
you could do that every day.

1551
00:57:19.105 --> 00:57:22.067
Yeah. but if I did it every
day. it wouldn't be special.

1552
00:57:22.108 --> 00:57:25.236
Yes. but in Venice.
every day is a special day.

1553
00:57:25.278 --> 00:57:29.699
And this is why we need
you to work for Blossom.

1554
00:57:29.741 --> 00:57:31.910
Would you stay?

1555
00:57:31.951 --> 00:57:33.953
What do you mean?

1556
00:57:33.995 --> 00:57:35.830
I mean. would
you stay in Venice

1557
00:57:35.872 --> 00:57:40.752
to make those videos with me?

1558
00:57:40.794 --> 00:57:44.714
And be with you
every step of the way.

1559
00:57:44.756 --> 00:57:46.966
That's the best part
of your pitch so far.

1560
00:57:49.386 --> 00:57:54.391
You know. I have another place
to show you. so let's go.

1561
00:57:54.432 --> 00:57:55.642
OK.

1562
00:57:55.684 --> 00:57:56.518
Oh.

1563
00:57:56.559 --> 00:57:59.354
[chuckling]

1564
00:57:59.396 --> 00:58:02.607
[uplifting music]

1565
00:58:02.649 --> 00:58:06.236
Wow. looks like
love is in the air.

1566
00:58:06.277 --> 00:58:09.572
Apparently. this is the most
romantic place in the world.

1567
00:58:09.614 --> 00:58:12.784
[chuckles].

1568
00:58:12.826 --> 00:58:15.495
I never thought of
bridges as being romantic.

1569
00:58:15.537 --> 00:58:17.914
but this one proves me wrong.

1570
00:58:17.956 --> 00:58:21.376
See. the guidebooks can
never compare to seeing

1571
00:58:21.418 --> 00:58:22.419
this city with a local.

1572
00:58:25.839 --> 00:58:27.257
There's no other
place like Venice.

1573
00:58:30.093 --> 00:58:33.596
I still can't believe
how you just decided

1574
00:58:33.638 --> 00:58:36.391
to take a plane to come here.

1575
00:58:36.433 --> 00:58:38.810
I did it for work.

1576
00:58:38.852 --> 00:58:43.314
Maybe now there's
something more than work.

1577
00:58:43.356 --> 00:58:47.110
[laughs] I mean. you've been
learning so much about Venice.

1578
00:58:47.152 --> 00:58:48.903
Mm-hmm.

1579
00:58:48.945 --> 00:58:53.366
You know about the legend
of the Bridge of Sighs?

1580
00:58:53.408 --> 00:58:54.909
No.

1581
00:58:54.951 --> 00:58:57.120
OK. so then the legend
goes that if a couple kisses

1582
00:58:57.162 --> 00:58:59.581
under the bridge at
sunset. they will

1583
00:58:59.622 --> 00:59:01.583
be blessed with eternal love.

1584
00:59:01.624 --> 00:59:03.001
Hmm.

1585
00:59:03.043 --> 00:59:05.253
That's really beautiful.

1586
00:59:05.295 --> 00:59:09.716
I never thought of
bridges as being romantic.

1587
00:59:12.552 --> 00:59:17.265
I'm just checking that this
isn't the Bridge of Sighs.

1588
00:59:17.307 --> 00:59:17.932
right?

1589
00:59:17.974 --> 00:59:18.767
This one.

1590
00:59:18.808 --> 00:59:20.101
Mm-hmm.
No?

1591
00:59:20.143 --> 00:59:20.769
No.

1592
00:59:20.810 --> 00:59:21.770
OK.

1593
00:59:21.811 --> 00:59:23.772
[chuckling]

1594
00:59:23.813 --> 00:59:25.315
I'd love to see it one day.

1595
00:59:38.411 --> 00:59:39.454
Here you go.

1596
00:59:39.496 --> 00:59:41.498
Thank you.

1597
00:59:41.539 --> 00:59:46.920
[sighs] Can you believe today
is the last day of the course?

1598
00:59:46.961 --> 00:59:47.921
I know.

1599
00:59:47.962 --> 00:59:49.214
It's gone by so fast.

1600
00:59:49.255 --> 00:59:50.715
Time flies when
your teacher's pet.

1601
00:59:50.757 --> 00:59:51.925
Oh. come on.

1602
00:59:51.966 --> 00:59:54.135
I am not.

1603
00:59:54.177 --> 00:59:56.638
I'm just going to miss the
people and the classes.

1604
00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:58.098
Huh.

1605
00:59:58.139 --> 00:59:59.349
I thought you just took
the course to persuade

1606
00:59:59.391 --> 01:00:01.226
Marcello to work with you.

1607
01:00:01.267 --> 01:00:02.560
I did at first. but--

1608
01:00:02.602 --> 01:00:05.146
Now you want him
to love your cooking.

1609
01:00:05.188 --> 01:00:06.898
[laughs] No.

1610
01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:08.608
Well. OK. maybe I do.

1611
01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:10.068
A little bit.

1612
01:00:10.110 --> 01:00:11.903
So has he signed
up to work with you?

1613
01:00:11.945 --> 01:00:12.737
No.

1614
01:00:12.779 --> 01:00:13.905
Not yet. but--

1615
01:00:13.947 --> 01:00:14.739
He's interested.

1616
01:00:14.781 --> 01:00:15.740
Hopefully.

1617
01:00:15.782 --> 01:00:17.575
[laughs] I knew it.

1618
01:00:17.617 --> 01:00:21.246
And I think there's something
more going on with you two.

1619
01:00:21.287 --> 01:00:22.831
OK. maybe a bit.
And me.

1620
01:00:22.872 --> 01:00:24.249
Me too.

1621
01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:26.334
[gasps] You found a
summer romance in Italy.

1622
01:00:26.376 --> 01:00:28.253
This is better than
a romance novel.

1623
01:00:28.294 --> 01:00:31.214
I know it sounds crazy.
but this doesn't feel

1624
01:00:31.256 --> 01:00:33.425
like a summer romance at all.

1625
01:00:33.466 --> 01:00:34.592
It feels real.

1626
01:00:34.634 --> 01:00:36.428
Oh. wow.

1627
01:00:36.469 --> 01:00:37.429
OK.

1628
01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:38.972
Well. how is that going to work?

1629
01:00:39.014 --> 01:00:40.849
Is he going to move
to New York with you?

1630
01:00:40.890 --> 01:00:42.267
No. no.

1631
01:00:42.308 --> 01:00:44.310
He's made that clear.
but we're talking

1632
01:00:44.352 --> 01:00:46.938
about him working from here.

1633
01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:50.025
So you would
also work in Italy?

1634
01:00:50.066 --> 01:00:51.860
I don't know. maybe.

1635
01:00:51.901 --> 01:00:55.697
I mean. I haven't checked
with my boss yet. but yeah.

1636
01:00:55.739 --> 01:00:58.324
Then maybe I will too.

1637
01:00:58.366 --> 01:00:59.075
What?

1638
01:00:59.117 --> 01:01:00.827
What do you mean?

1639
01:01:00.869 --> 01:01:02.996
I heard that Marcello's dad is
shorthanded in the restaurant.

1640
01:01:03.038 --> 01:01:04.122
Should I ask?

1641
01:01:04.164 --> 01:01:05.248
I would die to work in Venice.

1642
01:01:05.290 --> 01:01:06.958
Yes. absolutely ask.

1643
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.460
Maybe we could
be roommates here?

1644
01:01:08.501 --> 01:01:09.336
Yes. amazing.

1645
01:01:09.377 --> 01:01:10.003
Cheers.

1646
01:01:10.045 --> 01:01:12.547
Cheers.

1647
01:01:12.589 --> 01:01:16.426
[murmuring]

1648
01:01:19.846 --> 01:01:20.764
[laughs]

1649
01:01:20.805 --> 01:01:21.723
Crazy.

1650
01:01:21.765 --> 01:01:22.807
Bonjourno. everyone.

1651
01:01:22.849 --> 01:01:23.558
Bonjourno.

1652
01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:30.690
I'm sad to say that today is the
last day of our cooking course.

1653
01:01:30.732 --> 01:01:32.400
Ae.

1654
01:01:32.442 --> 01:01:35.820
All of you have impressed me
so much over the past weeks.

1655
01:01:35.862 --> 01:01:38.823
learning and creating
beautiful Italian dishes.

1656
01:01:38.865 --> 01:01:40.450
Well done.

1657
01:01:40.492 --> 01:01:43.453
You have poured your hearts
and souls into your food

1658
01:01:43.495 --> 01:01:46.664
and I really
appreciate the passion.

1659
01:01:46.706 --> 01:01:48.333
Grazie.

1660
01:01:48.375 --> 01:01:50.418
Now. I don't want to
get too emotional.

1661
01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:55.256
so [clears throat]
for our last day.

1662
01:01:55.298 --> 01:01:58.343
I have chosen a dish that
sounds simple. but is

1663
01:01:58.385 --> 01:02:00.261
in fact. quite complex.

1664
01:02:02.889 --> 01:02:05.016
It's a dish that is going
to help you to remember

1665
01:02:05.058 --> 01:02:06.643
your happy time here in Venice.

1666
01:02:06.685 --> 01:02:08.937
And I'm talking
about the risotto.

1667
01:02:08.978 --> 01:02:12.899
[upbeat music]

1668
01:02:19.406 --> 01:02:21.074
Don't forget to use the basil.

1669
01:02:21.116 --> 01:02:22.033
Never.

1670
01:02:22.075 --> 01:02:23.785
I love basil.

1671
01:02:23.827 --> 01:02:24.869
It's very romantic. I hear.

1672
01:02:24.911 --> 01:02:27.622
[singing in italian]

1673
01:02:42.804 --> 01:02:44.055
Good.

1674
01:02:44.097 --> 01:02:47.517
[singing in italian]

1675
01:03:24.054 --> 01:03:24.888
Done.

1676
01:03:24.929 --> 01:03:25.680
It's perfect.

1677
01:03:34.064 --> 01:03:38.985
So Bradford. tell me about
yours and Olivia's risotto.

1678
01:03:39.027 --> 01:03:40.570
What did you do?

1679
01:03:40.612 --> 01:03:43.198
Mostly. I did
what Olivia told me.

1680
01:03:43.239 --> 01:03:46.993
She told me to stir and
she focused on flavors.

1681
01:03:47.035 --> 01:03:48.787
Sounds like
excellent teamwork.

1682
01:03:57.754 --> 01:03:58.546
Mm.

1683
01:04:01.966 --> 01:04:04.511
It's very good.

1684
01:04:04.552 --> 01:04:05.345
Bravi.

1685
01:04:09.516 --> 01:04:10.934
Stunning presentation.

1686
01:04:15.397 --> 01:04:20.860
[inhales] [clears throat]
And I can smell the lime.

1687
01:04:20.902 --> 01:04:21.736
which is nice.

1688
01:04:32.038 --> 01:04:33.581
Perfecto.

1689
01:04:33.623 --> 01:04:34.916
There's nothing else to say.

1690
01:04:34.958 --> 01:04:36.418
Bravissimo.

1691
01:04:36.459 --> 01:04:38.586
You'll turn me into
a good cook after all.

1692
01:04:38.628 --> 01:04:40.255
Maybe you are
already a good cook.

1693
01:04:40.296 --> 01:04:42.924
And I have a feeling that you're
going to become a great chef.

1694
01:04:42.966 --> 01:04:45.343
if you want.

1695
01:04:45.385 --> 01:04:48.430
I'll see you all at
the party tonight. OK?

1696
01:04:48.471 --> 01:04:50.849
[italian] My compliments.

1697
01:04:50.890 --> 01:04:53.685
[claps] Molto bene.

1698
01:04:53.727 --> 01:04:54.769
Mwah.

1699
01:04:54.811 --> 01:04:55.520
No.

1700
01:04:55.562 --> 01:04:57.355
Yes. Jessica. darling.

1701
01:04:57.397 --> 01:04:58.898
We all saw it.

1702
01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:00.817
A summer romance in Italy.

1703
01:05:00.859 --> 01:05:01.735
Can you even?

1704
01:05:01.776 --> 01:05:04.821
Oh. I think it's
quite delicious.

1705
01:05:04.863 --> 01:05:06.114
You guys. stop.

1706
01:05:13.705 --> 01:05:16.082
Congratulations
on your win. ladies.

1707
01:05:16.124 --> 01:05:19.127
Although. I think our teacher
was grading on a curve.

1708
01:05:19.169 --> 01:05:20.837
What?

1709
01:05:20.879 --> 01:05:23.381
I mean. our risotto was the
best. but not going to lie.

1710
01:05:23.423 --> 01:05:25.508
I think the fact that you
made it kind of helped.

1711
01:05:25.550 --> 01:05:28.261
No. how dare you
align our risotto

1712
01:05:28.303 --> 01:05:30.305
with allegations of favoritism.

1713
01:05:30.347 --> 01:05:31.890
Whatever is
going on here seems

1714
01:05:31.931 --> 01:05:35.560
to be far more interesting
than clearing dirty saucepans.

1715
01:05:35.602 --> 01:05:37.979
Marcello and Amy are totally
crushing on each other.

1716
01:05:38.021 --> 01:05:39.564
Huh?

1717
01:05:39.606 --> 01:05:41.566
That means they really
like each other. Bradford.

1718
01:05:41.608 --> 01:05:42.817
Oh.

1719
01:05:42.859 --> 01:05:44.027
Obviously.

1720
01:05:44.069 --> 01:05:47.113
It was clear to me from
the moment they met.

1721
01:05:47.155 --> 01:05:51.117
Chemistry is everything.

1722
01:05:51.159 --> 01:05:54.037
I'll help you with those pans.

1723
01:05:54.079 --> 01:05:55.038
[phone dinging]

1724
01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:08.176
[sighs]

1725
01:06:14.307 --> 01:06:19.229
Wow. that is a very long line.

1726
01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:20.855
Is it good or is it bad?

1727
01:06:20.897 --> 01:06:22.899
Don't look worried. it's good.

1728
01:06:22.941 --> 01:06:24.275
Hey.

1729
01:06:24.317 --> 01:06:25.694
Oh. what's happening over here?

1730
01:06:25.735 --> 01:06:27.195
Oh. Olivia is just
giving me a read.

1731
01:06:27.237 --> 01:06:28.571
Oh.

1732
01:06:28.613 --> 01:06:30.031
Jessica has a shift
in her fate line.

1733
01:06:30.073 --> 01:06:31.241
Her what?

1734
01:06:31.282 --> 01:06:34.077
Oh. that is very
exciting. Jessica.

1735
01:06:34.119 --> 01:06:35.870
[laughter]

1736
01:06:35.912 --> 01:06:37.163
Amy. your turn.

1737
01:06:37.205 --> 01:06:38.248
Oh. no. no. no. no.
I'm OK.

1738
01:06:38.289 --> 01:06:39.082
Oh. come on.

1739
01:06:39.124 --> 01:06:40.041
Come on.

1740
01:06:40.083 --> 01:06:41.251
It's just a bit of fun.

1741
01:06:41.292 --> 01:06:42.377
OK.

1742
01:06:42.419 --> 01:06:43.795
OK. why not.

1743
01:06:43.837 --> 01:06:45.088
- OK. give me both your hands.
- Mm-hmm.

1744
01:06:45.130 --> 01:06:46.172
Let's have a look.

1745
01:06:46.214 --> 01:06:48.550
Ah. that's interesting.

1746
01:06:48.591 --> 01:06:50.552
You have earth hands.

1747
01:06:50.593 --> 01:06:53.054
Yes. yes. yes. I can see that.

1748
01:06:53.096 --> 01:06:54.389
Meaning what?

1749
01:06:54.431 --> 01:06:56.683
Well. earth means
you're very practical.

1750
01:06:56.725 --> 01:06:58.435
logical. and a thinker.

1751
01:06:58.476 --> 01:06:59.519
Mm-hmm.

1752
01:06:59.561 --> 01:07:01.604
But you know what I think?

1753
01:07:01.646 --> 01:07:04.441
Maybe you think a
little bit too much.

1754
01:07:04.482 --> 01:07:07.027
and you're not
hearing your heart.

1755
01:07:07.068 --> 01:07:09.571
and you're not
listening to your gut.

1756
01:07:09.612 --> 01:07:12.949
I mean. it is about
food after all.

1757
01:07:12.991 --> 01:07:13.950
I should go.

1758
01:07:13.992 --> 01:07:15.201
No. no. no. no.
no. no. no. no.

1759
01:07:15.243 --> 01:07:17.203
Olivia's just getting
to the good stuff.

1760
01:07:17.245 --> 01:07:19.330
Look at that love line.

1761
01:07:19.372 --> 01:07:21.458
OK. I'm going to
go and do some work.

1762
01:07:21.499 --> 01:07:23.626
See you later.

1763
01:07:23.668 --> 01:07:25.337
- My turn.
- Oh. come on. Bradford.

1764
01:07:25.378 --> 01:07:26.880
You just want to
hold Olivia's hands.

1765
01:07:26.921 --> 01:07:30.425
Oh. I don't mind holding
your hand. Bradford.

1766
01:07:30.467 --> 01:07:32.510
Mm-hmm.

1767
01:07:32.552 --> 01:07:35.638
[speaking italian]

1768
01:07:36.806 --> 01:07:38.808
I do love it when
you work together.

1769
01:07:38.850 --> 01:07:41.102
Yeah. I know
you do. amore mio.

1770
01:07:41.144 --> 01:07:43.438
It wasn't the same when you
were in New York. [italian]..

1771
01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:44.773
I know.

1772
01:07:44.814 --> 01:07:48.193
I'm so happy to be
back home in Italy.

1773
01:07:48.234 --> 01:07:51.363
Yeah. your mother was telling
me about this Amy person.

1774
01:07:51.404 --> 01:07:52.489
You're spending time with her.

1775
01:07:52.530 --> 01:07:53.531
So you like her.

1776
01:07:53.573 --> 01:07:54.616
Mm?

1777
01:07:54.657 --> 01:07:56.284
Papa. she lives in New York.

1778
01:07:56.326 --> 01:07:57.369
I'm here.

1779
01:07:57.410 --> 01:07:58.745
But you like her. no?

1780
01:07:58.787 --> 01:08:02.040
Yes. but it
can't be like that.

1781
01:08:02.082 --> 01:08:04.167
[speaking italian]

1782
01:08:04.209 --> 01:08:05.001
[laughs]

1783
01:08:05.877 --> 01:08:07.295
Come on.

1784
01:08:07.337 --> 01:08:09.839
I don't want to have anything
less than what you have.

1785
01:08:09.881 --> 01:08:10.548
Mm-hmm.

1786
01:08:10.590 --> 01:08:11.966
[chuckling]

1787
01:08:12.008 --> 01:08:14.260
Marcello. we both see
how you look this woman.

1788
01:08:14.302 --> 01:08:16.513
Maybe she's your one [italian].

1789
01:08:16.554 --> 01:08:21.768
[chuckling] OK.
anyhow. [italian]..

1790
01:08:21.810 --> 01:08:22.602
Catch you later.

1791
01:08:22.644 --> 01:08:25.313
Ciao. ciao.

1792
01:08:25.355 --> 01:08:27.482
Ciao.

1793
01:08:27.524 --> 01:08:29.818
[speaking italian]

1794
01:08:29.859 --> 01:08:32.737
Oh. wow these people are--

1795
01:08:32.779 --> 01:08:35.031
so what's the word for Marcello?

1796
01:08:35.073 --> 01:08:37.534
Oh. he said he'll
make a decision tonight.

1797
01:08:37.575 --> 01:08:40.328
but it's driving me crazy.

1798
01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:41.538
What about you?

1799
01:08:41.579 --> 01:08:43.415
Did you talk to
Marcello's parents?

1800
01:08:43.456 --> 01:08:45.166
Yes. and they seem interested.

1801
01:08:45.208 --> 01:08:46.292
[gasps] Wow.

1802
01:08:46.334 --> 01:08:47.711
Well. listen.

1803
01:08:47.752 --> 01:08:48.503
No matter what. tonight
should be a celebration.

1804
01:08:48.545 --> 01:08:49.879
Mm-hmm.

1805
01:08:49.921 --> 01:08:51.214
We did a great job
finishing the course.

1806
01:08:51.256 --> 01:08:52.549
we should be having fun.

1807
01:08:52.590 --> 01:08:54.134
You do remember how to
have fun. don't you?

1808
01:08:54.175 --> 01:08:56.219
[laughs] I think so.

1809
01:08:56.261 --> 01:08:58.513
Jessica. ciao. ciao.

1810
01:08:58.555 --> 01:09:00.849
Ciao. Amy.

1811
01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:02.934
What a lovely celebration.

1812
01:09:02.976 --> 01:09:05.687
We have a lot to celebrate.

1813
01:09:05.729 --> 01:09:08.023
Here. have some Venetian spritz.

1814
01:09:08.064 --> 01:09:09.024
Thank you.

1815
01:09:09.065 --> 01:09:09.899
Grazie.

1816
01:09:09.941 --> 01:09:11.526
Grazie.

1817
01:09:11.568 --> 01:09:13.236
Mm.

1818
01:09:13.278 --> 01:09:14.195
This is delicious.

1819
01:09:14.237 --> 01:09:17.699
Ah. it's my favorite.

1820
01:09:17.741 --> 01:09:18.950
Don't worry.

1821
01:09:18.992 --> 01:09:20.243
He will be here soon.

1822
01:09:20.285 --> 01:09:21.578
[laughs]

1823
01:09:21.619 --> 01:09:23.830
Oh. there he is.

1824
01:09:23.872 --> 01:09:26.708
[italian] and
welcome to the final

1825
01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:29.878
celebration of our advanced
Italian cooking course.

1826
01:09:29.919 --> 01:09:33.048
Our cooking students
have worked incredibly

1827
01:09:33.089 --> 01:09:36.968
hard to master the magic
of the Italian cuisine.

1828
01:09:37.010 --> 01:09:41.514
So now please. students.
come to the front.

1829
01:09:41.556 --> 01:09:42.724
- Can I leave this here?
- Si.

1830
01:09:42.766 --> 01:09:43.558
AMY: Thank you.

1831
01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:44.809
BRADFORD: [chuckles]

1832
01:09:45.935 --> 01:09:48.146
Unbelievably
impressed by all of you.

1833
01:09:48.188 --> 01:09:51.816
You have just set a new bar
for innovation and excellence.

1834
01:09:51.858 --> 01:09:54.277
And as you know. for
me. preparing good food

1835
01:09:54.319 --> 01:09:55.779
is an act of love.

1836
01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:59.824
And in learning to cook
with me. each one of you

1837
01:09:59.866 --> 01:10:01.659
has earned a place in my heart.

1838
01:10:01.701 --> 01:10:04.954
So I'm just happy to announce
that you have all graduated.

1839
01:10:04.996 --> 01:10:08.625
and now you can proudly call
yourselves advanced cooks

1840
01:10:08.667 --> 01:10:10.251
in the art of Italian cuisine.

1841
01:10:10.293 --> 01:10:13.296
[applause]

1842
01:10:14.339 --> 01:10:15.590
Oh. wow.
Thank you.

1843
01:10:15.632 --> 01:10:16.549
Jessica.

1844
01:10:16.591 --> 01:10:17.384
Thank you.

1845
01:10:17.425 --> 01:10:18.301
Olivia.

1846
01:10:18.343 --> 01:10:19.302
Grazie. [italian].

1847
01:10:19.344 --> 01:10:22.931
And Bradford. no.

1848
01:10:22.972 --> 01:10:26.393
And now there is just one last
thing to do. the class photo.

1849
01:10:26.434 --> 01:10:28.603
Oh. Marcello. you must
stand in the middle.

1850
01:10:28.645 --> 01:10:29.437
Why don't you just--

1851
01:10:32.691 --> 01:10:36.319
CATALINA: 1. 2-- uno. due. tre.

1852
01:10:36.361 --> 01:10:37.195
ALL: Pasta.

1853
01:10:37.237 --> 01:10:38.530
[speaking italian]

1854
01:10:38.571 --> 01:10:42.200
[elegant music]

1855
01:10:44.536 --> 01:10:47.414
Oh. that was tasty.

1856
01:10:47.455 --> 01:10:49.124
Feeling great?

1857
01:10:49.165 --> 01:10:52.419
Would you like
to dance with me?

1858
01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:53.503
I would love to.

1859
01:10:57.882 --> 01:11:00.969
[singing in italian]

1860
01:11:06.307 --> 01:11:07.809
What's wrong?

1861
01:11:07.851 --> 01:11:09.644
I don't know.

1862
01:11:09.686 --> 01:11:11.062
You tell me.

1863
01:11:11.104 --> 01:11:12.564
I'm going to have
to leave tomorrow

1864
01:11:12.605 --> 01:11:15.650
unless you give me an answer.

1865
01:11:15.692 --> 01:11:17.152
I'm still considering it.

1866
01:11:17.193 --> 01:11:19.571
[scoffs] I can't stay
in Venice forever waiting

1867
01:11:19.612 --> 01:11:21.656
for you to make up your mind.

1868
01:11:21.698 --> 01:11:23.283
Marcello. I have a job.

1869
01:11:23.324 --> 01:11:26.786
I've offered you
creative control.

1870
01:11:26.828 --> 01:11:29.831
What does it mean exactly?

1871
01:11:29.873 --> 01:11:34.419
It means that it'll
be a collaboration.

1872
01:11:34.461 --> 01:11:37.172
We could be partners.

1873
01:11:37.213 --> 01:11:39.382
So that means that
you're staying in Venice?

1874
01:11:39.424 --> 01:11:40.550
Yes.

1875
01:11:40.592 --> 01:11:41.384
Yes.

1876
01:11:44.554 --> 01:11:45.597
So then I say yes.

1877
01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:50.435
Really?

1878
01:11:50.477 --> 01:12:03.698
1.000% yes.

1879
01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:05.617
[chuckling]

1880
01:12:07.619 --> 01:12:08.578
I'm so sorry.

1881
01:12:12.832 --> 01:12:15.460
Oh. it's my boss.

1882
01:12:15.502 --> 01:12:18.380
Do you mind if I tell
her the good news?

1883
01:12:18.421 --> 01:12:19.297
No. go ahead.

1884
01:12:19.339 --> 01:12:20.173
Pardon.

1885
01:12:24.803 --> 01:12:26.221
Naomi.

1886
01:12:26.262 --> 01:12:28.682
Hi. Marcello's agreed
to come on board.

1887
01:12:28.723 --> 01:12:30.266
And it's going to
be a collaboration

1888
01:12:30.308 --> 01:12:32.727
with his cooking school in
Italy and it's going to be all

1889
01:12:32.769 --> 01:12:34.646
about passion and community--

1890
01:12:34.688 --> 01:12:36.231
NAOMI (ON PHONE): Amy. pause.

1891
01:12:36.272 --> 01:12:39.067
I've read your emails
and I love the concept.

1892
01:12:39.109 --> 01:12:42.445
but I think it's just a
little off brand for Blossom.

1893
01:12:42.487 --> 01:12:44.447
But it could be Blossom.

1894
01:12:44.489 --> 01:12:46.908
Lovely work getting
him. but he has to get

1895
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:49.077
on board with what we create.

1896
01:12:49.119 --> 01:12:52.288
Meal prep kits with
supplements is our brand.

1897
01:12:52.330 --> 01:12:54.749
But Marcello wants
the food to be natural.

1898
01:12:54.791 --> 01:12:57.627
Well. this isn't about what
Marcello wants or doesn't want.

1899
01:12:57.669 --> 01:13:00.714
You were on to something with
the Hacking Your Health line.

1900
01:13:00.755 --> 01:13:02.090
Yeah. yeah. I know.

1901
01:13:02.132 --> 01:13:05.427
But since being here.
I see that natural food

1902
01:13:05.468 --> 01:13:08.388
has all the benefits of
the supplements and more.

1903
01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:12.017
Naomi. cooking for other
people is an act of love.

1904
01:13:12.058 --> 01:13:13.810
What has gotten into you?

1905
01:13:13.852 --> 01:13:15.687
I think we have the
opportunity to create

1906
01:13:15.729 --> 01:13:18.189
a product that is truly unique.

1907
01:13:18.231 --> 01:13:20.650
Thank you. Amy. but no.

1908
01:13:20.692 --> 01:13:22.277
I appreciate your enthusiasm.

1909
01:13:22.318 --> 01:13:24.696
We have to stick
with what Blossom is.

1910
01:13:24.738 --> 01:13:26.448
But--

1911
01:13:26.489 --> 01:13:27.490
NAOMI (ON PHONE): Sage has
you both booked on a flight

1912
01:13:27.532 --> 01:13:28.658
back to New York tomorrow.

1913
01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:30.118
We can talk more
once you're home.

1914
01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:33.663
But I just told Marcello
we could work from Venice.

1915
01:13:33.705 --> 01:13:35.540
Well. things change.

1916
01:13:35.582 --> 01:13:37.917
See you in New York.

1917
01:13:37.959 --> 01:13:39.002
For the cosmetics team.

1918
01:13:42.088 --> 01:13:45.383
Is everything OK?

1919
01:13:45.425 --> 01:13:46.259
No.

1920
01:13:49.471 --> 01:13:55.143
Naomi wants us to fly
to New York tomorrow.

1921
01:13:55.185 --> 01:13:57.854
She wants to go back
to the original Hacking

1922
01:13:57.896 --> 01:14:01.274
Your Health format in New York.

1923
01:14:01.316 --> 01:14:05.653
I guess it's better
for the brand.

1924
01:14:05.695 --> 01:14:07.322
I'm sorry.

1925
01:14:07.364 --> 01:14:09.741
I've already told you. I'm
not going back to New York--

1926
01:14:09.783 --> 01:14:10.825
I know you said that.

1927
01:14:10.867 --> 01:14:12.994
I know. but--

1928
01:14:13.036 --> 01:14:15.538
You made me feel this
was something real.

1929
01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:17.999
And I feel it too.

1930
01:14:18.041 --> 01:14:22.837
Marcello. the past few weeks
have felt like a dream.

1931
01:14:22.879 --> 01:14:27.175
but maybe I have to wake up.

1932
01:14:27.217 --> 01:14:30.428
I want to stay here with
you. Marcello. I do.

1933
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:33.056
But I have a job.

1934
01:14:33.098 --> 01:14:38.645
And if Naomi won't get
behind this idea. then--

1935
01:14:38.687 --> 01:14:41.773
I've worked really hard to
get to where I am today.

1936
01:14:44.693 --> 01:14:48.947
Why do you always have
to make things complicated?

1937
01:14:48.988 --> 01:14:54.494
I know that you're scared. but
if you feel something for me.

1938
01:14:54.536 --> 01:14:57.789
maybe it's time
to make it simple.

1939
01:14:57.831 --> 01:15:02.585
Just follow your instincts. OK?

1940
01:15:02.627 --> 01:15:05.672
What do you feel?

1941
01:15:05.714 --> 01:15:08.800
I want to. but I can't.

1942
01:15:15.348 --> 01:15:18.768
(QUIETLY) Of course you can.

1943
01:15:18.810 --> 01:15:22.105
I'm sorry. but
I have to go back.

1944
01:15:26.943 --> 01:15:27.736
OK.

1945
01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:32.907
I'm sorry. too.

1946
01:15:32.949 --> 01:15:36.828
[solemn music]

1947
01:15:57.265 --> 01:15:58.725
I'm so sorry to see you go.

1948
01:15:58.767 --> 01:15:59.934
Oh. me too.

1949
01:15:59.976 --> 01:16:01.519
Please come back
and visit. hmm?

1950
01:16:01.561 --> 01:16:02.187
I will.

1951
01:16:02.228 --> 01:16:02.979
Ciao. bella.

1952
01:16:03.021 --> 01:16:04.189
Ciao.

1953
01:16:04.230 --> 01:16:05.565
We missed you last night.

1954
01:16:05.607 --> 01:16:06.358
Ah.

1955
01:16:06.399 --> 01:16:07.567
It was quite the party.

1956
01:16:07.609 --> 01:16:09.110
Wow.

1957
01:16:09.152 --> 01:16:10.945
Olivia and Bradford realized
they both knew how to tango

1958
01:16:10.987 --> 01:16:12.989
and they burned up
the dance floor.

1959
01:16:13.031 --> 01:16:14.324
For hours.

1960
01:16:14.366 --> 01:16:16.076
Made me exhausted
just watching them.

1961
01:16:16.117 --> 01:16:17.911
Did you sneak off with Marcello?

1962
01:16:17.952 --> 01:16:18.787
No.

1963
01:16:18.828 --> 01:16:20.205
No. we had a fight.

1964
01:16:20.246 --> 01:16:21.873
Oh. I'm so sorry.

1965
01:16:21.915 --> 01:16:23.458
Mm-hmm. me too.

1966
01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:24.834
I can't believe this is how
things are going to end.

1967
01:16:24.876 --> 01:16:25.794
No. no. no. no. no.

1968
01:16:25.835 --> 01:16:27.170
Does it have to end?

1969
01:16:27.212 --> 01:16:28.963
All I know is that
Marcello is staying here.

1970
01:16:29.005 --> 01:16:31.257
and I'm heading
back to New York.

1971
01:16:31.299 --> 01:16:33.885
Anyway. when are you leaving?

1972
01:16:33.927 --> 01:16:34.761
I'm not.

1973
01:16:34.803 --> 01:16:36.096
What?

1974
01:16:36.137 --> 01:16:37.472
Marcello's parents
offered me the job.

1975
01:16:37.514 --> 01:16:38.264
What?

1976
01:16:38.306 --> 01:16:39.474
No way. ah.

1977
01:16:39.516 --> 01:16:40.975
I'm so happy for you.

1978
01:16:41.017 --> 01:16:42.894
Ah. it's not the same as
opening my own restaurant.

1979
01:16:42.936 --> 01:16:45.146
but you know. step in
the right direction.

1980
01:16:45.188 --> 01:16:46.606
Yeah.

1981
01:16:46.648 --> 01:16:47.816
I was really hoping you
and I could have found

1982
01:16:47.857 --> 01:16:49.275
an apartment here together.
- I know.

1983
01:16:49.317 --> 01:16:50.860
I know. but I've got
to go back to Blossom

1984
01:16:50.902 --> 01:16:53.613
and explain why I lost Marcello
as the consulting chef.

1985
01:16:53.655 --> 01:16:55.573
Have you at least
called him to say goodbye?

1986
01:16:55.615 --> 01:16:58.118
I tried. but it went
straight to voicemail.

1987
01:16:58.159 --> 01:16:59.536
Maybe you could
talk to your boss

1988
01:16:59.577 --> 01:17:01.079
about staying here
a little longer?

1989
01:17:01.121 --> 01:17:03.456
[laughs] I think
that ship has sailed.

1990
01:17:03.498 --> 01:17:05.417
Speaking of. I need
to catch my water

1991
01:17:05.458 --> 01:17:07.335
taxi to take me to the airport.

1992
01:17:07.377 --> 01:17:09.963
It's been lovely
meeting you. Jessica.

1993
01:17:10.005 --> 01:17:11.256
Come here.

1994
01:17:11.297 --> 01:17:12.632
Good luck with everything.

1995
01:17:12.674 --> 01:17:16.136
And enjoy this exciting
new life in Venice.

1996
01:17:16.177 --> 01:17:17.804
It was nice to meet you. Amy.

1997
01:17:17.846 --> 01:17:20.598
You too.

1998
01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:22.392
And Amy?

1999
01:17:22.434 --> 01:17:23.643
You're a good chef.

2000
01:17:23.685 --> 01:17:27.605
[solemn music]

2001
01:17:49.085 --> 01:17:51.504
[whispering] Hey. [italian].

2002
01:17:51.546 --> 01:17:52.380
Hey.

2003
01:18:00.388 --> 01:18:01.848
What's wrong?

2004
01:18:01.890 --> 01:18:03.350
What's wrong. mama?

2005
01:18:03.391 --> 01:18:05.310
Me and Amy. we are not going
to be working together.

2006
01:18:05.352 --> 01:18:06.186
It's a fact.

2007
01:18:06.227 --> 01:18:07.062
I know.

2008
01:18:07.103 --> 01:18:08.396
She just left.

2009
01:18:08.438 --> 01:18:10.023
How can you let
her go like that?

2010
01:18:10.065 --> 01:18:12.776
Her boss wants us to
go back to New York and--

2011
01:18:12.817 --> 01:18:14.611
[speaking italian]

2012
01:18:16.654 --> 01:18:19.324
But you like Amy. no?

2013
01:18:19.366 --> 01:18:20.158
A lot.

2014
01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:21.034
Yes.

2015
01:18:21.076 --> 01:18:22.327
You love her.

2016
01:18:22.369 --> 01:18:23.703
I know you love her.

2017
01:18:23.745 --> 01:18:24.412
He loves her.

2018
01:18:24.454 --> 01:18:25.872
I know he loves her.

2019
01:18:25.914 --> 01:18:27.040
I know he does.

2020
01:18:27.082 --> 01:18:27.957
You know he does.

2021
01:18:27.999 --> 01:18:29.959
Everybody knows.

2022
01:18:30.001 --> 01:18:33.171
But leave him alone.

2023
01:18:33.213 --> 01:18:34.923
No.

2024
01:18:34.964 --> 01:18:36.091
Don't let her go.

2025
01:18:36.132 --> 01:18:37.676
Go and talk to her.

2026
01:18:37.717 --> 01:18:39.386
But if I go and then
I discovered that she

2027
01:18:39.427 --> 01:18:40.470
doesn't love me at all--

2028
01:18:40.512 --> 01:18:42.514
[speaking italian]

2029
01:18:43.598 --> 01:18:46.476
If you can't see
that she loves you.

2030
01:18:46.518 --> 01:18:48.895
then you are truly an idiot.

2031
01:18:48.937 --> 01:18:50.438
[laughs]

2032
01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:53.066
[speaking italian]

2033
01:18:55.902 --> 01:18:56.569
OK.

2034
01:18:56.611 --> 01:18:58.905
[speaking italian]

2035
01:18:59.781 --> 01:19:01.700
Thanks. mama.

2036
01:19:01.741 --> 01:19:02.409
Hey.

2037
01:19:02.450 --> 01:19:05.578
[exhales] See you later.

2038
01:19:08.415 --> 01:19:12.460
[phone ringing]

2039
01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:20.176
I'm just getting ready
to leave for the airport.

2040
01:19:20.218 --> 01:19:21.970
Great.

2041
01:19:22.012 --> 01:19:24.431
You and Marcello are going to
be pitching the board tomorrow.

2042
01:19:24.472 --> 01:19:26.599
No. Marcello is not coming.

2043
01:19:26.641 --> 01:19:28.393
I sent you an email.

2044
01:19:28.435 --> 01:19:29.561
I know. I saw it.

2045
01:19:29.602 --> 01:19:31.104
I figured you'd fix it.

2046
01:19:31.146 --> 01:19:32.272
No.

2047
01:19:32.313 --> 01:19:34.607
No. I won't fix this.

2048
01:19:34.649 --> 01:19:36.651
He doesn't want to
come to New York.

2049
01:19:36.693 --> 01:19:38.653
But this is what you do.

2050
01:19:38.695 --> 01:19:40.321
You need to convince him.

2051
01:19:40.363 --> 01:19:42.699
This is who you are. Amy.

2052
01:19:42.741 --> 01:19:47.579
Actually. I don't
think this is who I am.

2053
01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:48.997
I'm confused.

2054
01:19:49.039 --> 01:19:50.165
What are you saying?

2055
01:19:50.206 --> 01:19:52.167
I don't want to
be the person who

2056
01:19:52.208 --> 01:19:54.294
convinces people to do things.

2057
01:19:54.336 --> 01:19:58.965
I want to be the person who
does something they love.

2058
01:19:59.007 --> 01:20:02.844
Are we diverging?

2059
01:20:02.886 --> 01:20:04.387
I think so.

2060
01:20:04.429 --> 01:20:07.474
I'm happy for you.
but you can't leave me

2061
01:20:07.515 --> 01:20:09.309
hanging with Dr. Frankenfood.

2062
01:20:09.351 --> 01:20:10.268
No.

2063
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:12.062
No. I won't.

2064
01:20:12.103 --> 01:20:14.856
I know there are plenty
of other amazing chefs

2065
01:20:14.898 --> 01:20:16.816
who would love to
work at Blossom.

2066
01:20:16.858 --> 01:20:18.026
OK.

2067
01:20:18.068 --> 01:20:19.110
Thank you.

2068
01:20:19.152 --> 01:20:20.737
You're not mad?

2069
01:20:20.779 --> 01:20:21.905
Mad?

2070
01:20:21.946 --> 01:20:24.115
Of course I'm mad.

2071
01:20:24.157 --> 01:20:26.201
But I am letting it go.

2072
01:20:26.242 --> 01:20:28.578
I'm really grateful for
everything you've done for me.

2073
01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:30.580
And I'm grateful for you.

2074
01:20:30.622 --> 01:20:33.375
Good luck with everything.

2075
01:20:33.416 --> 01:20:34.542
[phone beeps]

2076
01:20:36.961 --> 01:20:42.592
[exhales] Hey.

Marcello?

2083
01:21:32.142 --> 01:21:35.186
What are you doing?

2084
01:21:35.228 --> 01:21:36.771
What are you doing here?

2085
01:21:36.813 --> 01:21:38.565
My parents told me
that you checked out

2086
01:21:38.606 --> 01:21:39.899
and you were leaving.

2087
01:21:39.941 --> 01:21:42.694
Yeah. I'm heading
back to New York.

2088
01:21:42.736 --> 01:21:45.238
Except I quit my job at Blossom.

2089
01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:46.948
You quit?

2090
01:21:46.990 --> 01:21:49.159
I don't want to work there
anymore. but I have to go back.

2091
01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:51.161
I mean. why go back now?

2092
01:21:51.202 --> 01:21:52.662
Because I have a life there.

2093
01:21:52.704 --> 01:21:54.289
But you can have a life here.

2094
01:21:54.330 --> 01:21:55.832
I mean. just drive me crazy.

2095
01:21:55.874 --> 01:21:57.751
You said that you'd
stay for work.

2096
01:21:57.792 --> 01:22:01.004
and now I'm asking
you to stay for me.

2098
01:22:06.676 --> 01:22:07.594
What are you saying?

2099
01:22:07.635 --> 01:22:08.636
What are you saying?

2100
01:22:11.222 --> 01:22:12.599
I love you.

Do you see where we are?

Bridge of Sighs.

2106
01:22:46.841 --> 01:22:49.678
If a couple kisses under
the bridge at sunset.

2107
01:22:49.719 --> 01:22:51.346
they will be blessed
with eternal love.

2108
