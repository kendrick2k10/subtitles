00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.560
Criminal case 19504.

5
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.440
United States
versus Zaid al-Safarini.

6
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.200
Welcome to
the United States District Court.

7
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.280
I invite anyone who would like to
speak to the court today to do so.

8
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.320
We never talk about it.

9
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.080
35 years have gone by.

10
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.160
But some things stay in the memory.

11
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.600
Mr Maisel.
Thank you. Your Honour.

12
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.040
We are here to remember.

13
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.400
Reports coming in on the apparent
hijacking of a Pan American 747.

14
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.040
We are here to recount.

15
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.880
We are here to bear witness.

16
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.400
We are here to punish.

17
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.000
I hope he suffers.

18
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.400
We are here for justice.
Safarini?

19
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.960
TWA flight 847 with 39 Americans
taken hostage for 17 days.

20
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.200
Rome Airport.
just days after Christmas.

21
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.840
This incredibly dangerous
and dramatic situation...

22
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.480
People are being held here
as hostage...

23
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.000
Terrorists are not freedom fighters
or anything else.

24
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.800
Palestine is a battlefield
and it is our land.

25
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.120
A ten-year-old boy inherits the gun
of the dead Fedayeen.

26
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.720
He could well become a terrorist.

27
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.560
As terror spreads
across the Middle East.

28
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.600
the '80s had surely become the age
of the airline attack.

29
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.400
I hope nothing happens.
I think we'll be fine.

30
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.760
And. of course. Libya has a finger
in most terrorist pies.

31
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.520
My fellow Americans.
at seven o'clock this evening.

32
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.320
air and naval forces
launched a series of strikes

33
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.160
against Muammar Gaddafi.

34
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.720
The raid on Colonel Gaddafi's
headquarters in Tripoli

35
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.280
killing an adopted daughter.

36
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.560
This pre-emptive action
will provide him with incentives

37
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.040
and reasons to alter
his criminal behaviour.

38
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.840
Karachi was just to pick up
passengers. drop off people

39
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.960
from Bombay. and then carry on.

40
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.600
I was desperate to get home.

41
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.880
I had a couple of friends
hiking with me in Pakistan.

42
00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.960
We had walked up
to Broad Peak base camp.

43
00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.560
which is right at the foot of K2.

44
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.480
Every day it was incredibly hot.

45
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.040
We hadn't had a decent meal.

46
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.280
And I felt exhausted
at the end of all of that.

47
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.560
In the Pan Am office. a woman said.

48
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.160
"Yes. I have a flight from Karachi
to Frankfurt to London."

49
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.680
It was a business-class seat.
I had never flown business class.

50
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.680
And I thought. "This is fantastic."

51
00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.560
I made my parents
buy me a ticket to India

52
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.240
and spend my summer vacation there.

53
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.600
It was a great summer.
But you wanna get back home.

54
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.440
I was travelling
as an unaccompanied minor.

55
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.240
I really had to persuade my mom
to send me.

56
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.160
I'm her only child. I told her.

57
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.920
"It'll be great.
I'll be a good boy."

58
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.560
The one thing my mom
was very keen on is.

59
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.360
"Hey. listen.
I want you to come back.

60
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.840
so don't lose your passport.
Dwijal. or else."

61
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.520
We were travelling
to the US that day.

62
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.280
I finished my masters
and she finished her education

63
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.440
and then we decided to move there
for better studies.

64
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.200
We were sitting in the aisle seat
in the middle in economy class.

65
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.400
My sister Sana and my brother Imran.
Three of us.

66
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.440
I was 24.

67
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.000
I was 24? I was born in '62. so...

68
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.960
I don't know how old I was.
I stopped counting my age.

69
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.680
The first thing I heard
was shouting.

70
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.720
Move or we will kill!

71
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.080
We heard automatic fire.

72
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.840
Move in!

73
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.200
And saw the security guy
holding onto a passenger.

74
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.600
My first thought was

75
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.080
maybe the passenger was a criminal
or something.

76
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.040
Down! Everyone sit down!

77
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.480
I saw a man struggling
with one of the flight attendants

78
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.520
in the second doorway.

79
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.040
I didn't think of.
sort of. running away.

80
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.440
I just stared at him and thought.
"That's a man with a gun."

81
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.240
Everybody get down!

82
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.080
Behind me. in the front doorway.

83
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.720
there was another man in uniform
with a rifle.

84
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.560
I thought that he was on my side.
You have been hijacked!

85
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.120
There were four of them on board.
Two guys came from the front.

86
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.320
Look down! Don't look at me!

87
00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.440
And then there was two guys
at the back.

88
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.800
They were wearing blue uniforms.
light-blue uniforms.

89
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.120
Look down!

90
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.880
They look like safety guys. They are
the policemen. What's happening?

91
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.520
Everyone sit down!

92
00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.760
Sit down! Hands up!

93
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.400
I saw a man shouting. "Hands up!"

94
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.640
Hands up. like that. Like that.

95
00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.520
Up!
We saw. like. the hand grenade.

96
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:32.000
And that was the point
when you just freeze.

97
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.200
Don't look at me! Higher! Up! Up!

98
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.960
One of the guys looked like a kid.

99
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.120
Nobody move!

100
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.800
The young hijacker.
he looked into my eyes.

101
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.960
It's very hard for me to forget.

102
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.080
Don't look at me!
What did I tell you?

103
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.800
And he was a bit harsh. you know.
A bit harsh?

104
00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.120
Hijack!
Anyone move and they get hurt!

105
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.760
My 11-year-old brain

106
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.280
was used to going through drills.

107
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.600
fire drills at school.
earthquake drills.

108
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.880
"Ah. it's just another drill.
It's a hijack drill."

109
00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.640
I do remember other children
starting to cry

110
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:21.440
and I remember at the time
priding myself cos I wasn't crying.

111
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.960
You. too! Look down! Don't move!

112
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.920
I dialled the emergency number
for the cockpit.

113
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.320
And then I gave the code
for a hijacking.

114
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:39.000
On this 747. the cockpit crew
is on the upper deck.

115
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.480
So they would not be able to see
what was happening in the main deck.

116
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.520
My flight engineer.
he came right back in the cockpit

117
00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.280
and was in a panic.

118
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.520
I felt very frightened.

119
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.880
And then we had the first
announcement in English.

120
00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.640
"Ladies and gentlemen.
the group responsible apologise

121
00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.960
for the inconvenience caused.
Their argument is not with you.

122
00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.000
They do not wish to hurt anyone.

123
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.120
But if you make any sudden movement.
you will be shot."

124
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.160
When I saw that the ad for Pan Am
said they were hiring

125
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.920
flight attendants
from Mumbai. India.

126
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.520
I was excited.

127
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.800
Pan Am was an international carrier.
It kind of made history.

128
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.040
There were 10.000 applications.

129
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.320
They had never done
anything like that before.

130
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.880
They'd only ever had
flight attendants from the US.

131
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:51.800
I was born in Bombay. I always
wanted to be a flight attendant.

132
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.040
Pan Am was a legend.

133
00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:00.440
Anywhere in the world you went.
there's two names people knew.

134
00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.520
Coca-Cola and Pan Am.

135
00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.160
'More style.
more luxury in the sky.'

136
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.320
It had the reputation of being one
of the best airlines in the world.

137
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.680
So prestigious.
you want to give it your best.

138
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.120
Because being America.
you had to be super slim.

139
00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.080
You had to look a certain way.
You had to dress a certain way.

140
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.760
You had to act a certain way.

141
00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:34.520
We were a young bunch of
enthusiastic. excited young people.

142
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.080
I was over the moon.

143
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.880
A dream come true.

144
00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.960
It was that bond that we shared.

145
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.920
It was about two and a half months

146
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.400
we had started as full-fledged crew.

147
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.360
I had done
about eight or nine flights.

148
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.760
10 to 12 flights.

149
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.680
I just... I loved it.
I just loved it.

150
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.040
Keep your hands up. all of you!

151
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.680
Don't look at me! Look down!

152
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.640
One of them shouted
a list of instructions.

153
00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:29.520
It sounded to me as if this was
the leader of the terrorists.

154
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.280
I didn't want to look him in the eye.

155
00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.200
Move. You. come!

156
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:38.480
He was the real deal.
Quick! Come! Where are the pilots?

157
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.320
'An aircraft on the ground.
effectively immobilised.

158
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.080
is the best solution
to reduce risk of harm to hostages.'

159
00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.600
We knew that we had to do
everything we could

160
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.840
to make this airplane unusable
and to exit and get out of here.

161
00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.120
'Your possibilities for survival
are greatly reduced

162
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.560
when the plane is airborne.'

163
00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.120
Open the door. Open it!

164
00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.200
'Remember to keep the hijacker
out of the cockpit if possible.'

165
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.280
Open the door!
Captain. can you hear me?

166
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.040
Key.
I do not have a key. sir.

167
00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.800
Captain.
Open the door.

168
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.400
I had the key all the time.

169
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.600
Open the door.
I do not have access.

170
00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.840
Open the door.
I am asking them to open the door.

171
00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.280
Captain. can you come to the door.
- please?
- Move. move!

172
00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.640
The flimsiest door in the world.

173
00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.840
He just pushed me aside
and kicked it in.

174
00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.520
'In security training.
crew members have been told

175
00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.040
to consider the possibilities
of escaping.'

176
00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.040
He was in shock.
Like. "Now what do I do?"

177
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.120
You wear the hat.

178
00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:09.360
I'm not the captain.
I can't fly a plane. so no.

179
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.760
Move.

180
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.480
Your knowledge of past hijackings.

181
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.480
emergency procedures
and aircraft equipment

182
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.040
will help you
to assess the situation

183
00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.000
and take the actions
you believe to be appropriate

184
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.680
in order to minimise danger.

185
00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.680
The cockpit crew had left
and I knew how they would have

186
00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.040
because we learned that in training.

187
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.760
I felt deserted.

188
00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:52.520
that they had left us to handle
this... ordeal on our own.

189
00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.400
It was hard to leave the cockpit.

190
00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:02.080
to leave the flight attendants
with these terrorists.

191
00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.920
You feel like you're abandoning them.

192
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:11.440
You don't know what's gonna happen.
what's next.

193
00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:20.240
Everybody get up. Out of your seats.
Move!

194
00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.880
Up! Move!

195
00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.200
'Obviously. it is not possible
to plan a specific course of action

196
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.720
for every emergency.'
Move!

197
00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.680
'Each situation is unique

198
00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.480
and judgements appropriate
to the situation must be made.'

199
00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:38.160
- Move!
- They wanted the passengers
to be collected in one place.

200
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.720
Move!
Sardined together in the centre.

201
00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.680
Walk.

202
00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.080
Hands up.

203
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:50.200
People were crowding.
There was no room to move.

204
00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.000
That's kind of when it hit me. like.

205
00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.840
"OK. maybe this is not a drill."

206
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:05.440
There was an announcement made
to lower the window shades.

207
00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:11.160
People outside couldn't see in.
we couldn't see out.

208
00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.000
We were sealed off.

209
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:23.800
That sort of discomfort with extreme
fear. it really gets to you.

210
00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.760
I just wanted to get up and scream.

211
00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:36.200
The gentle. plinky-plonky music
that they used to play

212
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.640
before they took off
was on this endless loop.

213
00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.880
The Entertainer

214
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.880
playing again and again and again.

215
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.600
It just played all day.

216
00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.680
Again and again and again.

217
00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:57.400
Don't look at me!

218
00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.160
'Now you know.

219
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:09.320
Pan Am will bring you
the world's first 747.'

220
00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:13.080
I did 30 years
with Pan American World Airways...

221
00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:18.600
...working on Boeing 707. 747.

222
00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:23.360
whether it was electrical.
radio. mechanical. you name it.

223
00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.720
physically working on the airplane.

224
00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:32.080
In 1982. I was made the head
of Pan American for Pakistan

225
00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.560
and Iran and Afghanistan.

226
00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:42.120
On that particular day.
I was at home.

227
00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:46.040
They woke me up.
I immediately went to the airport.

228
00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:52.440
I must have arrived half an hour
after the incident had taken place.

229
00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.440
Nobody knew at that time that they
were hijackers or what they want.

230
00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:07.360
The door opened and one
of the crew members... called out...

231
00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:10.640
Please come and talk to us.

232
00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:15.320
And there was nothing coming from
any of the government officials

233
00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:17.480
to say what we should do.

234
00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.040
It was their responsibility.

235
00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.600
It's not for me to do that.

236
00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:28.720
The main hijacker.
he wasn't willing to...

237
00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:33.160
to speak over the megaphone.
and I would speak on the megaphone.

238
00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.000
Please. come and talk to us.

239
00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:41.560
I thought. "If I don't go out there

240
00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.240
and if this guys keeps calling out.

241
00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.800
he may do something drastic...

242
00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.320
...because no-one was coming
in front of him."

243
00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.040
Please. somebody.

244
00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:57.120
So I said. "I have to go out
and speak to them."

245
00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.880
They didn't say. "Don't do it."
or anything like that.

246
00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.400
They said. "Thank you very much."

247
00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.760
He says where is the crew
to fly the plane?

248
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.200
I was terrified.

249
00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.840
I. too. wanted the captain back.

250
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.520
I have no idea
where the crew have gone.

251
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.320
All I know is that they've got off
the plane and gone somewhere.

252
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.400
I was lying. of course.

253
00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.480
I was not going to tell him
that they were in my office.

254
00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.040
The whole idea was to buy time.

255
00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:45.360
Because what we would do next
would depend upon

256
00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.480
what the government of Pakistan decided.

257
00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.320
When I went back. they wanted to
know. "Who was he? What did he..."

258
00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:58.520
And I told them that it appears he's
from some Middle Eastern country.

259
00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.840
The government official
instructed police

260
00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.080
to go to every hotel in Karachi.

261
00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:12.160
We had to find the passport
the passenger has to give

262
00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.760
when he checks into the hotel.

263
00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.640
Thank God they stayed
in the Taj Mahal Hotel

264
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.840
on the main airport road.

265
00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.160
To work it out was easy because
they had all checked in together

266
00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.160
and they all had the same
type of passport with them.

267
00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.680
They were Palestinians.

268
00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.000
We just got word
from the Associated Press

269
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.240
of a hijacking tonight
in Karachi. Pakistan.

270
00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:39.520
A Pan Am 747. flight 73.

271
00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.840
with 390 passenger on board.

272
00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.800
We've just received
satellite pictures

273
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.400
of the scene at Karachi Airport.
where hijackers are holding

274
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:50.120
a Pan Am jumbo jet
with nearly 400 people aboard.

275
00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.760
There is Karachi Airport
in Pakistan.

276
00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.480
There is the aircraft.

277
00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.440
They came back
with photocopies of the passport

278
00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:03.920
and I said.
"Yes. this is the gentleman."

279
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.440
His name was Safarini.

280
00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:37.280
Palestinian guerrillas insist
that their acts of violence

281
00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:40.480
are the only way they can bring
world attention to their cause.

282
00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:02.840
Abu Nidal is the most dangerous
terrorist in the world at present

283
00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.360
and his group is in many ways
the most reckless and dangerous

284
00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:08.800
of all the Palestinian groups.

285
00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.960
Rome Airport.
just days after Christmas.

286
00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:15.080
The nightmare voyage of the
hijacked cruise ship Achille Lauro.

287
00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:19.840
TWA flight 847. with 39 Americans.
taken hostage for 17 days.

288
00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:23.800
Terrorists are not guerrillas

289
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.680
or freedom fighters
or anything else.

290
00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:31.920
They are terrorists and they should
be identified as such.

291
00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:57.120
♪ Home of the brave ♪

292
00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.920
Safarini wanted to find out
if they were on the news.

293
00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.800
Hijacking was something
that happened.

294
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:31.040
I knew that this might well be
the Westerners' problem.

295
00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.080
There was a Pakistani man
and his daughter sitting

296
00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.240
just beside me on the floor.

297
00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:45.960
They were probably looking at me
thinking. "He's in front of us."

298
00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.000
I was sitting next to
a middle-aged man and his wife.

299
00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:57.440
I just whispered to the man.
"Where are you from?"

300
00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:00.480
And he muttered back.
"North America."

301
00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.040
It's not something that I'm proud of.
to think that. you know.

302
00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.080
I would prefer the Americans
to be in front of me.

303
00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:14.280
but... when it comes down to it.
that's what you do.

304
00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.240
You work out the odds.

305
00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:24.240
On the second time
when I went spoke to him.

306
00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:28.160
his demand was better communication.

307
00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.240
OK!

308
00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.400
He was not that good in English.
He was asking the girl

309
00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.560
what was I saying. And I said.

310
00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:39.840
"Would it be alright if I stand on
top of the stair and speak to you?"

311
00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.040
No!

312
00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.200
I'll give you a walkie-talkie.
No!

313
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:54.280
He was angry and he said he wanted
to fly to Larnaca. Cyprus.

314
00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:58.360
And he said
there were a lot of their friends

315
00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:02.040
who were incarcerated in Larnaca.

316
00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:05.120
And they want to go there
to get them released.

317
00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.520
And he said. "Where is the crew?

318
00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.000
I want the crew to come back
to fly the plane out."

319
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.640
I asked him. "Would you consider
letting the women and children go?"

320
00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.320
No!

321
00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.880
And he closed the door.

322
00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.840
The Pakistani officials' approach
was.

323
00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:33.040
"Let's get the crew back
and let's fly the aeroplane out."

324
00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:36.720
They felt that if anything happens
to the aircraft

325
00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:41.320
on the Pakistan soil. the Americans
are going to get upset.

326
00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.800
I was told by the officials
that if need be.

327
00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.480
they would get a volunteer crew
who would fly the plane out.

328
00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:53.400
And I said.
"I have the responsibility

329
00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.680
of 300 people on that plane.

330
00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:58.480
Now the plane is on the ground
and we can negotiate.

331
00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.720
we can talk and solve the problem.

332
00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:03.840
But once up in the air.
nobody has control over that plane."

333
00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:21.280
Safarini kept trying to see
if he was on the news.

334
00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.200
But there wasn't anything.

335
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.840
And the first person in the aisle he
just grabbed and brought up front.

336
00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:35.160
Medium height.
Looks like somebody from India.

337
00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.200
And they were taking him.

338
00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.880
Safarini said.
"If you don't get the pilots.

339
00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.960
I'm going to shoot him."

340
00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:07.680
He was so terrified
and he looked to me to...

341
00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.880
to support him. to comfort him.

342
00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:18.480
I said to him. "Don't worry.
I'm here. Nothing's gonna happen."

343
00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:24.440
He asked him. "Why are you crying?
Are you a man?"

344
00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:30.320
He was just... It was sad to see.

345
00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:36.400
He did tell me that he was travelling
with his elderly grandmother.

346
00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:42.480
And asked if I would look after her
should anything happen to him.

347
00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:49.360
I assured him I would.

348
00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.920
I said. "If you shoot him.

349
00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:02.720
it'll be very difficult to convince
the government of Pakistan

350
00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.760
to find somebody
to fly the plane out."

351
00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:12.160
"Give me 20 minutes. I'll go back
to the officials. talk to them.

352
00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.280
and then maybe
we can sort this out."

353
00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:18.000
And he said. "OK."
OK!

354
00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.440
He shot him in the head.

355
00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:46.680
And this young man fell.
He slumped at my feet.

356
00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:51.160
And then...

357
00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:54.840
Safarini kicked his body out.

358
00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.640
And that was the turning point.

359
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.960
Because he also said.

360
00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:18.040
"Every 20 minutes. I'll bring
one passenger and shoot them."

361
00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:21.280
Now the situation
was totally different.

362
00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:28.680
Someone said. "They killed someone.
Someone got shot."

363
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.160
I don't remember hearing a shot.
but the fact that

364
00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:38.920
they were starting to kill people
made me really nervous.

365
00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.880
"What did I do wrong?"
was the biggest thought.

366
00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.920
Like. "Oh. my God. how did I
get myself in this situation?

367
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.120
Why did I tell my mom
I wanted to go to India?"

368
00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.040
Sitting in that seat. I felt...

369
00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:04.840
...very frightened. and I felt I had
to try to get control of myself.

370
00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:09.320
Safarini was... furious.

371
00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.440
"They made me do it.
They made me do it.

372
00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:14.480
I did not want to do it.
They made me do it."

373
00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:18.920
He was talking about the Americans
and the Israelis.

374
00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:05.800
Safarini told me
to collect passports.

375
00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:11.000
He wanted white Americans
or Israeli.

376
00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:21.640
I took my British passport
out of my pocket.

377
00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:26.040
I thought this was a Pan Am plane
and it would be full of Americans.

378
00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.920
If they were white Americans.

379
00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:48.480
I just dropped their passports
into their laps.

380
00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:52.640
I managed to drop
quite a few that way.

381
00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:59.960
I heard. "Sunshine. come up front.
Come back. come back."

382
00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:07.200
Give me American passport.

383
00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.600
I wanted to try
and hide the passports.

384
00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:20.880
I knew there was a risk.
I knew the way he was standing.

385
00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.480
he could turn at the wrong moment
and see me.

386
00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:28.000
but... I was trying to keep
the passengers from...

387
00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.560
...being killed.

388
00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:35.280
And I hid them under the seat.

389
00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:43.080
I said.
"These are all Indian Americas.

390
00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.480
so there's no white Americans
on board."

391
00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:56.280
He said. "Who are these white people
on the plane?"

392
00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:01.440
We explained to him that
they were different nationalities.

393
00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:05.560
You know. some were British.
some Italian. there were Canadians.

394
00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.000
His frustration was building up

395
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.960
because they've come into
an aircraft

396
00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.880
which doesn't have American crew.

397
00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:15.640
doesn't have enough American passengers.

398
00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.280
the cockpit crew who were there left.

399
00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:22.920
He didn't know what to do now.

400
00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:25.680
There's no Americans. Now what?

401
00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.400
"Can Michael John Thexton

402
00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.760
please make his way
to the front of the plane."

403
00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:38.480
I think I was... numb
hearing my name.

404
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.960
I was trying to convince myself that
there was some innocent explanation

405
00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.200
and maybe they were gonna
let me off the plane.

406
00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:55.000
Erm... but...
I kept coming back to the fact

407
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.360
that surely they were picking me out
to shoot me.

408
00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:03.960
And it is not really possible
to describe in words how that feels.

409
00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.880
The State Department in Washington
is following closely

410
00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.440
the takeover
of a Pan American jumbo jet.

411
00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:34.760
Four Arabic-speaking gunmen
demanded to be flown to Cyprus.

412
00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:37.400
The hijackers.
dressed as security guards.

413
00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.800
took over the airliner shortly after
it stopped over at Karachi.

414
00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.200
They're known to have
automatic weapons with them

415
00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:46.040
and have already shot one passenger
through the head.

416
00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:15.480
I felt... absolutely desperate.

417
00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:24.280
And I said. "My parents have
no-one else. Please don't hurt me."

418
00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:30.880
And I tried to say something
about my brother's death.

419
00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:35.320
But he just waved a hand as if to
say. "I haven't got time for that."

420
00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.840
Peter was six years older than me.

421
00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.920
He was the one
who did the exciting things.

422
00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:51.880
He was the doctor
on an expedition to K2

423
00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:55.240
in 1983

424
00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:58.480
and he died of altitude sickness.

425
00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:07.160
In 1986. I'd taken the summer off
to go on a mountaineering expedition

426
00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:09.280
to the Karakoram Himalaya.

427
00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:14.240
I wanted to... I wanted to see
where he died and say goodbye.

428
00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:24.920
I was absolutely convinced
that I was gonna die.

429
00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.920
The main thing I thought about
in that moment

430
00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:34.360
was how sorry I was for my parents.

431
00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:39.280
I thought about...
what they had gone through.

432
00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.560
what we had all gone through.
when my brother died.

433
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.560
I just felt so sad

434
00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:48.760
that they had lost my elder brother

435
00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:51.400
and now they were gonna lose me.
as well.

436
00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.960
I whispered
to one of the flight attendants.

437
00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:03.000
"Please tell my family
that I love them very much."

438
00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:27.440
He got me to open the door.

439
00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:33.360
Safarini stood one of the flight
attendants in that crack of daylight

440
00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:37.600
and she was speaking on a megaphone

441
00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:40.120
to somebody who was under the plane.

442
00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:42.720
OK!

443
00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:48.440
Safarini used Mike Thexton
as a prod to Viraf.

444
00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:51.320
He told me to tell you that...

445
00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:55.080
You don't get the pilots.
I'm going to shoot... Him.

446
00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:03.240
I thought that Safarini
would shoot me

447
00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.440
and I'm just waiting
for that to happen.

448
00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:12.640
At that point. I think I made

449
00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:15.440
one of the toughest decisions
of my life.

450
00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:19.760
I had no choice.

451
00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:23.480
There is a staff member of mine
on the aeroplane.

452
00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:28.040
I told him about one of my staff.

453
00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:33.040
Meherjee Kharas.
an aircraft maintenance man.

454
00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:36.440
trapped inside
when the hijackers took the plane.

455
00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:40.000
who will work the cockpit
radio communication.

456
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.640
At least now he will be appeased

457
00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:45.920
with better communication.
which he wanted.

458
00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:49.640
and he would calm down
and not shoot anybody else.

459
00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:54.560
Move.

460
00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:01.720
Hello?

461
00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:05.440
Flight 73.
Flight 73. I can hear you.

462
00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:09.240
The way it was set up was

463
00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:12.480
they would call
the operations office of Pan Am.

464
00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:15.440
"Pan Am flight 73."

465
00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:18.880
Safarini was not fluent in English.

466
00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:22.320
He wanted to speak with somebody
in Arabic.

467
00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:29.000
So eventually. somebody said that.
"OK. we found a gentleman

468
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.720
who used to work
for Saudi Arabian Airlines

469
00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:35.320
in their catering services."

470
00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:39.680
And we roped him in
to come and speak to him

471
00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.800
from the operations office
in Arabic.

472
00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.760
The man had never done
anything like this.

473
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:20.160
By that time. a government official
was already in my operations office.

474
00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.960
He was telling him
what to tell the hijackers.

475
00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:29.640
Now I'm not able to speak to him.
I don't know what he's saying.

476
00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:32.760
That was the most defeating thing
for me.

477
00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:15.200
At that point. of course.
we still didn't know

478
00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:18.760
exactly who
these Palestinian people were

479
00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:22.240
because no group had come forward
to claim responsibility.

480
00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:26.720
They started the killing
very early on.

481
00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:30.600
It must mean that they are one of
the professional Middle East gangs.

482
00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:34.000
Possibly the Abu Nidal gang.

483
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.680
Pan Am 73 in September of 1986.
it's not a one-off event.

484
00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:44.560
Libya has a finger in most terrorist
pies in one way or another.

485
00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:50.040
Reagan and Gaddafi
had been confronting each other.

486
00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:52.400
Like hornets in a bottle.

487
00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:55.920
Gaddafi wanted to be the leader

488
00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:59.240
of the radical world
against the West.

489
00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:02.400
This mad dog of the Middle East
has a...

490
00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:05.720
Reagan purposely tried to compare
Gaddafi to a dog.

491
00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:08.040
which in Arab culture
is one of the biggest insults

492
00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:10.400
you can make to a man.

493
00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:13.560
The game kept getting raised
up. up. up and up.

494
00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:16.800
At Vienna Airport. three men
threw four hand grenades.

495
00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.240
opened up with Kalashnikov
submachine guns...

496
00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:23.880
Libya was behind the attack
at the Rome and Vienna Airports.

497
00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:26.440
Libya was targeting
US service people.

498
00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:28.480
The wreckage of a night club
in Berlin.

499
00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.800
a gathering place
for young American soldiers.

500
00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:32.600
It was proven that Libya was behind

501
00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:35.600
the La Belle Disco bombing
in West Berlin in '86.

502
00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:39.600
President Reagan decided
he had to make a statement.

503
00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:42.760
And kill Gaddafi.

504
00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:48.280
Fellow Americans.
at seven o'clock this evening...

505
00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:52.040
...air and naval forces
launched a series of strikes

506
00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:53.960
against Muammar Gaddafi.

507
00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:55.920
By golly. we were gonna show

508
00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:58.880
the mad dog of the Middle East
America's back.

509
00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:02.080
But the raid on Tripoli
was a failure.

510
00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.840
And if you're gonna go after
the king.

511
00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:07.000
you better kill him.

512
00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:11.360
Gaddafi realised this was personal.

513
00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:14.960
It was time for payback.

514
00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:18.120
But it was a lot easier
to contract out the terror.

515
00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:33.720
By having one step removed. there's
fewer fingerprints. less DNA.

516
00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:53.640
I'll give him X million dollars.

517
00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:57.200
and Abu Nidal. who himself
never went on these missions.

518
00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:00.520
but he would recruit young believers
to carry it out.

519
00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:05.440
Pan Am was the flagship US carrier.

520
00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:10.720
Five months after
the raid on Gaddafi.

521
00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:14.080
the attack on Pan Am 73 occurred
in Karachi. Pakistan.

522
00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:34.640
At some point in the day.
they were going to make a demand.

523
00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:38.360
it wasn't going to be met.
and they would shoot me.

524
00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.440
I had this really strong thought

525
00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:50.040
that you shouldn't let
the sun go down on your anger.

526
00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:55.520
And I would offer
to shake Safarini's hand

527
00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.400
if he came down
and said he was gonna shoot me.

528
00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:02.120
I knew how a British gentleman
was supposed to behave

529
00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:04.120
in this sort of extremity.

530
00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:07.480
It was probably nonsense.

531
00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:11.440
but... I found it comforting
in that moment.

532
00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:18.080
It's very important to make sure
that the hijackers are calm

533
00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:21.360
and they have trust in you.
I believe that we have established

534
00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:24.920
that kind of rapport.
The situation remains the same.

535
00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:29.880
They are wanting the American crew
to come and take them away.

536
00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:35.440
The official of the government who
was sitting in the Pan Am office.

537
00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:39.400
he was getting instructions
from the government of Pakistan.

538
00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:44.040
My fear was. "How long will we
just communicate with them

539
00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:47.400
without knowing what is
the next thing we want to do?"

540
00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:53.080
So I went to see the state governor.

541
00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:55.280
who was at the airport.

542
00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:58.600
I went to ask him to tell me
what is plan B?

543
00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:03.040
I was told. "I'm sorry. you can't
speak to the governor just now.

544
00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:05.080
He's having his lunch."

545
00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:07.200
Without thinking. I just said.

546
00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:10.840
"300 people's lives are at stake
and he's having his lunch?"

547
00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:19.200
Right in the tail of the aeroplane
is the aircraft power unit.

548
00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:24.800
And that unit
supplies electrical power

549
00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:28.160
and air-conditioning power
for the aircraft

550
00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.200
whilst it is on the ground.

551
00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:36.280
The APU is designed to run
for maybe two hours. three hours.

552
00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:40.560
It's not designed to run
for 15 hours or 16 hours.

553
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.200
If the APU fails.

554
00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:46.440
the aeroplane
will just heat up quickly

555
00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:51.480
and it will be stiflingly hot inside
with people unable to breathe.

556
00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:55.560
And there'll be no radio contact.

557
00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:58.080
No communication. Nothing.

558
00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:02.880
I spoke with a government official.

559
00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:06.320
I said. "We need to have
a ground power unit connected

560
00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:09.880
just in case the aircraft power unit
shuts down."

561
00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:14.200
And he said. "I don't want
any piece of equipment

562
00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:17.120
or vehicle near the plane."

563
00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:28.880
And I have this late piece of copy
that has just been handed to me.

564
00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:31.360
Pakistani officials
are saying that the hijackers

565
00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:34.480
have offered to release
the Pan Am jet's passengers

566
00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:39.560
if a flight crew is brought on board
and they are flown to Cyprus.

567
00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.920
They communicated to him

568
00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:06.240
that Pan Am had arranged
for a volunteer crew

569
00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:10.360
which was on its way from Germany.
but it would take time.

570
00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:15.480
By the afternoon.

571
00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:18.320
press people found out
that we were in the operations room.

572
00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:20.440
They were trying to get
into the office.

573
00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:26.800
Phone lines were inundated.
non-stop. with people.

574
00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:30.960
They had loved ones on the plane.

575
00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:39.280
I was in graduate school in Seattle
at that time.

576
00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:43.360
It was very early hours
of the morning.

577
00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:48.080
My brother called me from Texas.

578
00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:51.600
And he said.
"It appears that Pan Am's plane

579
00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:53.840
has been hijacked in Karachi."

580
00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:57.160
My parents were coming here
for a wedding

581
00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:00.480
and the first trip
out of the country for both of them

582
00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.400
was Pan Am flight 73.

583
00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:05.160
They had never been outside
the country. either one of them.

584
00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:12.080
The first reaction
is just pure disbelief.

585
00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:15.520
And then there is this...

586
00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:18.480
...absolute feeling of terror.

587
00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:26.640
400 passengers and cabin attendants
are being held at this hour.

588
00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:30.560
The hijackers have shot
one passenger. it seems.

589
00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:33.600
through the head
and threw him off the aircraft.

590
00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:35.880
Passengers were boarding
for a flight to New York.

591
00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:39.160
but the cockpit crew escaped
just before the takeover.

592
00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:42.000
Isn't this a dereliction of duty?
Absolutely not.

593
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.840
The commander of the plane did
exactly what we expected him to do.

594
00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:48.600
It is long... Let me finish!
It's long-standing Pan Am...

595
00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:51.520
Everybody was calling me.
"Have you heard anything more?"

596
00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:55.600
The hijackers demanded a new flight
crew be brought to the plane

597
00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:57.760
in exchange
for some of the passengers.

598
00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:01.480
And they promise that as soon
as the crew is provided to them.

599
00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:04.200
that they will release
the passengers.

600
00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:08.560
All these horrific scenes
going through your mind

601
00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:12.120
is absolutely terrorising.

602
00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:14.640
My parents were on that plane.

603
00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:37.400
After... Many. many hours...
I think seven. eight hours.

604
00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:39.160
they were easing off. you know.

605
00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:42.720
They calmed down.

606
00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:55.160
For a long time.
we didn't have any food or drinks.

607
00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:58.240
We were well into many hours.

608
00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:05.840
Do you want a drink?

609
00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:08.400
Beer? Whisky?

610
00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:11.640
Er. a glass of water would be nice.

611
00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:15.280
Get him a drink.

612
00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:22.840
Eventually.
I remember them passing out

613
00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:25.480
I think they were
cucumber and chutney sandwiches

614
00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:28.280
or something of that sort.

615
00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:35.840
It got monotonous.

616
00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:47.560
Your mind kind of focuses
on different things.

617
00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:51.640
Like. "Wow. why do they keep
playing this song?

618
00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:53.400
There has to be another song."

619
00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:58.080
I kind of shut down a little bit.

620
00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:05.760
But eventually.

621
00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:10.240
I heard this kid next to me
who was upset.

622
00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:12.400
I wanted to make him feel better.

623
00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:21.160
And playing with him
made me feel better.

624
00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:28.920
A moment of happiness
in this really tense situation.

625
00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:34.960
That little kid really helped me.

626
00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:37.560
Yeah.

627
00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:52.880
I was very scared. deep inside.

628
00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:55.800
but. you know.
I was trying to look calm.

629
00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:00.320
And trying to do
her elder sister's duty.

630
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.040
And that situation.

631
00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:11.520
it was so tiring. so boring.

632
00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:19.640
And my brother. Imran.
started to get angry.

633
00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:24.240
He was planning just to take the gun
from the young guy.

634
00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:33.120
My brother was six feet tall
and he was a sportsman.

635
00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:38.840
He was an athlete and he had all the
qualities of an athlete. you know?

636
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:43.600
He said. "Let's go from this side.
I'll go from that side.

637
00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:45.520
and we take the gun.

638
00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:50.320
They're gonna kill us anyway.

639
00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:53.920
Why are they all
sitting like ducks?"

640
00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:57.920
And I still don't know
why people in that situation.

641
00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:01.880
they just sit and don't do nothing.
Because they have guns.

642
00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:05.520
Yeah. so maybe three people
be will be dead. four.

643
00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:15.240
I was scared to lose him. you know?

644
00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:18.520
I did not want my little brother dead.

645
00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:22.960
So I was telling him to calm down.

646
00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:29.600
Just hold on.

647
00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:41.040
There was one point where
Safarini sat down opposite me.

648
00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:45.120
Are you married?

649
00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:48.920
I have a girlfriend.

650
00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:53.720
And he just said.
"I'm sorry about this.

651
00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:56.040
I don't like this fighting.
this killing.

652
00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:59.520
I would like to go out dancing.
go out drinking. go out with women.

653
00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:03.320
But the Americans and Israelis
have stolen my country.

654
00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:06.400
and without my country.
these things are no good."

655
00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:32.600
I wouldn't in any way
condone what he was doing.

656
00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:36.800
But I remember feeling...

657
00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:42.720
...sorry for him. He thought that
terrorism would do some good.

658
00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:46.720
And yet it would only increase
all of the anger and suffering.

659
00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:49.240
I just felt that
that was terribly sad.

660
00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:59.560
But as time went on.

661
00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:03.520
somehow I was beginning
to have some hope

662
00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:07.160
that it would all resolve itself peacefully.

663
00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:17.000
Safarini seemed to be
in control of the situation.

664
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.520
He didn't seem worried.

665
00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:27.440
He said. "The captain's coming back
and we're gonna fly to Cyprus.

666
00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:31.000
But where do you all wanna go?"
He was actually joking with us.

667
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.120
And he named Bangkok.

668
00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:35.440
"Cos I can take you all anywhere."

669
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.160
He said. "It's my 24th birthday."

670
00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:47.760
And he asked for me to open
a bottle of champagne.

671
00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:50.480
Cheers.

672
00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:53.280
Champagne is normally
for good times.

673
00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:57.560
But I felt I had to drink with him.

674
00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:01.080
He started flirting.

675
00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:07.760
He asked me if I would go to the
disco with him if he came to Mumbai.

676
00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:16.920
I saw a belt around his waist.

677
00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:22.040
I asked what that was and he said.

678
00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:26.000
"This has been given to me
by my mother to prevent pain."

679
00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:35.520
It definitely looked like
it contained enough explosives

680
00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:39.200
to blow up the entire plane.

681
00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:45.560
That was the most stressful drink
of my life.

682
00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:08.400
- What is this?
- It's OK!

683
00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:11.680
Suddenly.
there was a loud. jarring sound.

684
00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:14.120
Go! Go!
OK.

685
00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:19.160
I told him. "It's OK. It's just
someone in the toilet smoking."

686
00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:28.120
Safarini's mood got a lot worse.

687
00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:30.320
He took me into the cockpit.

688
00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:31.360
Soldier.

689
00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:34.200
Soldier.

690
00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:37.920
He was afraid of snipers outside.

691
00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:45.760
Good morning. Pan American flight 73.

692
00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:50.560
hijacked about 12 hours ago by four
gunmen. is still on the ground...

693
00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:54.600
Back to the hijack. and Pan Am in
London has issued a telephone number

694
00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:57.520
for anyone concerned about
passengers on the Karachi jet.

695
00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:22.640
I suggested we listen to his demand

696
00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:26.920
and put lights all around the plane
so that they'd know

697
00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:31.480
there is no untoward incident
planned to try and storm the plane.

698
00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:36.080
The officials wouldn't listen.

699
00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:44.440
At this point.
I think he believed that

700
00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:46.960
perhaps the negotiators
are stalling.

701
01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:07.040
Safarini was upset.

702
01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.920
"Clipper 73."

703
01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:14.440
When the cockpit radio came on...

704
01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:17.320
"Clipper 73. come in. please."

705
01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:20.280
...he told me. "Ignore it."

706
01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:28.280
Clipper 73. come in. please.

707
01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:32.080
At that point. I knew...
Come in. please.

708
01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:35.080
...that time was running out.

709
01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:56.440
After running for 15 hours or so...

710
01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:02.320
...the power unit finally shut down.

711
01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:20.000
Move! What is this?

712
01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:23.600
Kharas explained
the power had failed

713
01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:25.760
and that the emergency lighting

714
01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:28.400
would not last for longer
than 15 minutes.

715
01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:32.720
after which it would not be possible
to restore the lights at all

716
01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:35.600
and there would be no power
for the plane to take off.

717
01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:39.680
There was a very bright light

718
01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:42.840
right above
the first officer's seat.

719
01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:44.600
Cover! Cover the light!

720
01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:48.040
And Safarini believed
that people from the outside

721
01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:50.840
could see very clearly
into the cockpit.

722
01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:54.400
Clipper 73.

723
01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:58.280
They said. "The aircraft is not
responding when we are calling out.

724
01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:01.000
Maybe the APU has failed.

725
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.680
which means there is no way
to talk to the hijackers."

726
01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:06.240
I said. "I've got to take a look."

727
01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:09.440
Out!

728
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.680
Wake up!

729
01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:20.600
Move!

730
01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:24.600
The music had stopped. the hiss
of the air-conditioning had stopped.

731
01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:27.760
and the lights were definitely
dimmer. And it was getting hotter.

732
01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:30.360
Hey.

733
01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:32.720
Move it! Up. up!

734
01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:36.560
Jamal shook me awake.
- kept pushing me.
- Go!

735
01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:40.520
Sit down! And everyone be quiet!

736
01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:43.280
Get up. Get back.

737
01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:47.640
Safarini saw me right in front
and he told me to go behind.

738
01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:49.840
so I climbed over two people.

739
01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:52.200
and he made me go further behind.

740
01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:55.440
I said. "Is this OK?"
And he says. "Yes. sit."

741
01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:02.000
I saw a window seat this time

742
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.200
and I thought.
"I'm back with the others.

743
01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:08.880
I stand the same chance as anybody.

744
01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:11.840
This is unbelievable."

745
01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:17.920
I sat down on the floor
with Kharas seated in front of me.

746
01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:26.800
It became challenging to even take
a nice. fresh breath of air.

747
01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.000
And I just wanted
to get out of there.

748
01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:33.360
I remember the lights flickering.

749
01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:38.520
And then all of a sudden.
they shut off.

750
01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:51.240
You. up.

751
01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:55.600
Safarini said.
"Make an announcement.

752
01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:57.960
I am trying to restore the lights."

753
01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:01.760
Please stay quiet and do not move.

754
01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:05.240
Sit.

755
01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:09.840
When I got there.
the airplane was in total darkness.

756
01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:15.880
I said.
"Let's put the tarmac lights on

757
01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:18.320
so they know that
there's nothing happening."

758
01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:23.080
He said. "There is no switches. We
cut the wire to put the lights off."

759
01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:34.880
An older lady leaned forward to me
and very quietly said...

760
01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:39.600
..."They're going to kill us now.
aren't they?"

761
01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:42.320
I patted her arm and I said.

762
01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:44.720
"No. no. It's going to be alright."

763
01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.200
Everybody was bracing themselves

764
01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:54.560
for whatever it was
that was going to happen.

765
01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:07.400
And I got as low in the seat
as I could get.

766
01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:09.520
I prayed.

767
01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:11.760
I prayed continuously.

768
01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:16.280
My brother. he told me.

769
01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:20.200
"Just pray to God
and remember our parents.

770
01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:22.400
This is it. We are gonna die."

771
01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:30.320
I needed to convince Safarini

772
01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:34.440
that we are doing everything
possible to get the power on again.

773
01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:01.480
I instinctively... dropped

774
01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:04.520
in between my seat
and the seat in front of me.

775
01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:07.760
Cos... I didn't know
what was happening.

776
01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:13.440
And I felt gun shells
hitting my arm.

777
01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:15.920
I looked up and that's when I saw

778
01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:20.040
that the hijacker was shooting...

779
01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:22.640
everywhere. aimlessly.

780
01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:28.800
The passengers were howling.

781
01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:32.880
It was like mass howling.
It was unearthly.

782
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.160
The young hijacker...

783
01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:41.040
..I saw him
throwing the hand grenade on us.

784
01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:45.240
And the hand grenades
they threw on our feet.

785
01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:49.040
My brother.
he was sitting next to me.

786
01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:52.680
My leg and his leg.
we were all. like. you know.

787
01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:54.800
blown up with the hand grenade.

788
01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:57.160
And... I thought I'm dead.

789
01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:59.120
I thought.

790
01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:02.960
"This it is.
I don't think I'm gonna make it."

791
01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:07.680
I looked down and I saw my. erm...

792
01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:13.200
...co-worker. the Pan Am
maintenance man. Kharas...

793
01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:17.520
...was no more.

794
01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.520
Someone started climbing over me

795
01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:30.200
to get into the aisle.

796
01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:33.640
So I reached for the little boy
who I was playing with.

797
01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:37.360
As I reached out for him.
I just saw him laying there.

798
01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:39.160
like he was sleeping.

799
01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:42.440
I just blocked him out of my mind.

800
01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:44.680
And I just kept going.

801
01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:49.720
I feel. erm... guilty.

802
01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:54.560
Like. "Why did I live
and he didn't?"

803
01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:10.320
The hijackers
began throwing hand grenades

804
01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:13.200
and firing into the helpless people
huddled together.

805
01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:18.800
When I opened my eyes.
I was alive and in so much pain.

806
01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:23.600
You can imagine. if a hand grenade
blew up on your feet.

807
01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:27.640
And then I try to get up from
my seat... Where was I at that time?

808
01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:30.800
You were on the seat.
All of you were. like. fainted.

809
01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:36.600
When the firing stopped.
there were cries of pain

810
01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:39.240
that could be heard
throughout the cabin.

811
01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:43.160
People started getting up
and running towards the doors.

812
01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.720
I just remember everyone

813
01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:49.280
just crowding around the door.
trying to get it open.

814
01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:53.440
Somebody. I don't know who.
emergency open

815
01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:55.880
and the people jump out.

816
01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:00.320
So I drag her
and throw her from the chute.

817
01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:03.960
It was easy for me
because she was petite and young.

818
01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:06.200
And my brother was six feet tall.

819
01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:09.680
It was not easy to drag him.

820
01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:11.800
but I didn't give up.

821
01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:16.240
Love make you very strong.

822
01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:19.800
We got out as fast as we could.

823
01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:22.440
either down the chutes or onto
the wing and jumping off the edge

824
01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:24.120
and then...

825
01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:29.280
I saw a gentleman leapt off the wing
and he fell

826
01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:33.840
and I hear him screaming really loud
as he hit the ground.

827
01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:39.680
When I was on the wing. I saw...

828
01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:43.920
...two of the hijackers

829
01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:46.520
jump off into the slide.

830
01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:49.080
along with the passengers.

831
01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:53.680
They threw all their weapons
to try and escape as a passenger.

832
01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:58.640
I took my two kids
and I hid them under the chair.

833
01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:01.240
And then I could see
their legs and hands.

834
01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:04.480
so I didn't want them to get hurt
on their legs and hands.

835
01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:07.400
so I laid myself on top of...

836
01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:13.680
In the terminal building.
it was just chaos.

837
01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:19.000
They took me to a hall area. which...

838
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.400
which... was just benches laid out

839
01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:24.800
and bodies on it covered.

840
01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:27.360
and they pulled back every sheet

841
01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:30.320
to see if any of them
was a hijacker.

842
01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:32.400
And none of them were.

843
01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.800
Two of the terrorists
tried to escape.

844
01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:39.000
They were set upon and beaten
by passengers on the ground

845
01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.920
before being taken into custody
by Pakistani police.

846
01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.920
They said
they had caught some people.

847
01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:48.920
And they take me to this truck...

848
01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:52.360
...with these three guys.

849
01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:55.960
And they made them stand up.
look at me. and I identified them.

850
01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:01.360
Then they took me to identify
the fourth guy.

851
01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:05.680
Safarini was in hospital.
where they wheeled him out.

852
01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:10.280
Safarini was injured.

853
01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:14.520
Shot by one of his own men.

854
01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:20.920
At the hospital.
it was a scene of complete chaos.

855
01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:26.040
Doctors and nurses
were dealing with patients

856
01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:29.520
on the floor and on beds.

857
01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:33.200
When they were trying to take out
the shrapnel from my back.

858
01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:38.160
I had cardiac arrest and they
announced me clinically dead.

859
01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:45.000
I saw a flight attendant. Neerja.
on the floor

860
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.560
and I went to a doctor and I tugged
at his sleeve and I said.

861
01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:52.800
"Come and help me." And he said.
"Everybody here is a critical case."

862
01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:07.080
I kept calling Karachi
to get some information.

863
01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:12.400
Eventually. I got a call

864
01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:15.400
that said. "Your parents are safe."

865
01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:21.760
After I... got the news.
it was this tremendous relief.

866
01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:29.880
I can still remember thinking.
"This is not real.

867
01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:33.360
I'm going to wake up in a minute
and I'll be back on that plane."

868
01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:41.120
It's one of the biggest medical
evacuations Pakistan has ever seen.

869
01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:43.360
Many still speechless in shock.

870
01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:48.040
Also on the Bombay flight.
the remains of one of the dead.

871
01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:50.600
as Indian hostess called Neerja.

872
01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:54.560
her chipboard coffin shuddering up
the conveyer belt into the hold.

873
01:12:55.880 --> 01:13:00.160
She was trying to help two children
to get out

874
01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:02.120
while the shooting was taking place.

875
01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:05.600
She was trying to get them out
through the door.

876
01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.840
And in the process. she got shot.

877
01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:25.160
Saturday morning.
my mother called me.

878
01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:31.440
She said. very calm...

879
01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:34.520
...very dignified. and she said...

880
01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:38.920
..."Your father's life story
has come to an end."

881
01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:41.040
That was the first thing
out of her mouth.

882
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.280
And I kept saying.
"Where is he? Where is he?"

883
01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:47.360
And she said. "He is no more."

884
01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:54.920
She said.
"I don't want you to get upset.

885
01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:00.640
It'll hurt me more than
it'll hurt you if you lose it.

886
01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:04.960
You hang in there." And...

887
01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:07.080
I'll take a drink of water.

888
01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.920
We keep asking everyone.
"How is Imran? How is Imran?"

889
01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:21.920
And later on. we find out
that the whole hospital

890
01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:26.040
was guided not to tell us
that he is no more with us.

891
01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:30.320
Some of the shrapnels
go into his head.

892
01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:32.720
He got heart attack and he died.

893
01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:37.720
During that time.
I thought he's alive.

894
01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:53.120
We went to the Sheraton

895
01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:56.440
where they had a copy
of the local paper.

896
01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:58.400
The headline was something like.

897
01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:02.600
"Daring commando raid
frees hijack passengers."

898
01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:06.160
Army commandos
approached the aircraft.

899
01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:09.680
The hijackers apparently saw them
and began shooting.

900
01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:11.840
And the commandos stormed the plane.

901
01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:16.080
After hearing gunfire
and explosions.

902
01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:18.680
Pakistani commandos
stormed the stricken plane.

903
01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:21.080
firing their weapons.

904
01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:23.800
There were no commandos there
to save us.

905
01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:27.400
No. there were no security forces
around the airplane.

906
01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:30.160
I looked when I came out. I looked
under the airplane and on the sides.

907
01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:32.480
There was no Pakistani action
that I know of.

908
01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:36.240
They didn't. That's all a fallacy.
No commandos came on.

909
01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:38.440
They do say that
a lie goes round the world

910
01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:40.200
before the truth
has got its trousers on.

911
01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:42.720
It turns out
that Pakistani commandos

912
01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:44.920
were actually storming the plane
at the same time

913
01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:49.080
the panicked passengers were
rushing through the emergency doors.

914
01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:57.880
Please come here.

915
01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:00.000
Oh. this is the press conference.

916
01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.280
How could four hijackers
inside the plane.

917
01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:07.640
busy shooting at passengers.
hold back your commandos.

918
01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:10.760
who you'd had all day
to get into place?

919
01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:14.200
Don't mind it. but I haven't
understood a word from your accent.

920
01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:17.280
Could somebody speak
in a different accent and let me...

921
01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:19.960
At the point
when the shooting started.

922
01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:23.720
the commandos. they were half a mile
away from the aircraft.

923
01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:26.520
So by the time they would... get up

924
01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:29.880
and pick up their weapons
and get into a bus and come there.

925
01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:32.080
it was all over.

926
01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:34.480
With me now is Pakistan's
ambassador to London.

927
01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:37.480
There have been criticisms.
largely that it was 25 minutes

928
01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:40.040
before your special guys
actually got on the plane.

929
01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:43.800
I spoke to the Secretary of Defence
and he told me

930
01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:46.400
that it took them
exactly three minutes

931
01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:48.800
to reach the plane

932
01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:51.960
and to save the people.

933
01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:54.680
Ambassador. we must stop there.
Thank you so much for joining us.

934
01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:00.120
President Zia was full of praise
for the way his security forces

935
01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:02.360
handled the hijack crisis.

936
01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:06.480
The Pakistani government at the time
saw Pan Am 73 as an embarrassment

937
01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:09.160
that it took place on their watch.
if you will.

938
01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:11.960
And they don't like to be embarrassed.

939
01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.920
They deal with it by trying to
cover it up and make it go away.

940
01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:19.120
I'm very proud of them because I
think the handling was professional.

941
01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:21.280
it was bravely handled.

942
01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:25.880
and the result was totally
what we expected.

943
01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:30.800
The FBI turned up in Karachi
and interviewed people.

944
01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:37.400
But General Zia was very firm

945
01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:39.800
that the Pakistanis
would deal with the hijackers.

946
01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:43.120
We have now a very effective law.

947
01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:45.720
the punishment of which
is death sentence.

948
01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:47.760
So I was aware of the trial

949
01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:52.400
and I was aware that
they had been found guilty

950
01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:54.400
and they were given a death sentence.

951
01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:57.760
I just assumed that
that was how it was going to stay.

952
01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:01.520
But after various reductions.
that just came down to being

953
01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:05.600
a 15-year sentence. a very short
time for all those deaths.

954
01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:09.400
Libya today categorically denied

955
01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:12.880
that it was involved in any way
with the Karachi hijacking.

956
01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:17.480
Politics. it's a game with rules
that are not written down.

957
01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:21.960
And that's why professional
diplomats and politicians play it.

958
01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:24.240
Administration officials
have been very cautious

959
01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:27.000
about linking Libya
to the Pan Am hijacking.

960
01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.400
Libya and Colonel Gaddafi. we cannot
connect this one at this time.

961
01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:36.040
- Are you gonna look. however?
- Well.
we will always be. er. vigilant

962
01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:39.280
in our efforts to find out
who commits acts of terrorism.

963
01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:41.360
to prevent them and...

964
01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:46.720
Why was the US hesitant to point to
Libya as the culprit in Pan Am 73?

965
01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:52.000
Optics. Put it this way. I think it
was embarrassing for Ronald Reagan.

966
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.440
You know. trying to kill Gaddafi
in Tripoli

967
01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:57.720
was a failure.

968
01:18:57.720 --> 01:18:59.880
I thought you taught Gaddafi
a lesson.

969
01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:03.040
but three months later.
he's. you know. doing this stuff.

970
01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:09.840
But remember what Pan Am 73
was supposed to be.

971
01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:14.600
It wasn't supposed to be carnage
on the ground in Karachi. Pakistan.

972
01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:17.000
That is not what the terrorists
wanted to do.

973
01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.440
They wanted to hijack a jumbo jet
loaded with fuel and passengers.

974
01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:24.520
crash it into a symbolic target

975
01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:27.440
in a spectacular suicide mission.
if you will.

976
01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:31.080
and do it in a way that it'll be
broadcast around the world.

977
01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:34.680
in every newspaper and television
station. for months and years.

978
01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:39.880
Clearly Pan Am 73. in hindsight.

979
01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:43.680
was a forerunner of the attacks
of September 11.

980
01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:24.080
We've arrested a known terrorist.

981
01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:26.440
Zaid Hassan Safarini.

982
01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:29.880
He's not affiliated with Al-Qaeda.

983
01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:33.280
Yet he's an example

984
01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:37.160
of the wider war on terrorism
and what we intend to do.

985
01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:38.840
Safarini?

986
01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:42.960
We got him and today
the United States of America

987
01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:45.000
will charge him with murder.

988
01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:09.520
We travelled to Washington

989
01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:11.840
for his hearing.

990
01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:14.800
They were calling upon
all survivors.

991
01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:17.280
witnesses.

992
01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:20.640
family members. crew.

993
01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:23.000
to testify in court.

994
01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:27.920
I thought. "I have to see
what happens to him.

995
01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:29.880
He was the man
that was going to shoot me."

996
01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:31.760
I didn't wanna go.

997
01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:34.400
I didn't want to see his face.

998
01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:38.720
I wanted him to be dead.

999
01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:46.160
Defendant Safarini
is directly responsible

1000
01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:48.680
for the deaths of 20 people.

1001
01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:54.080
the attempted murder
of about 358 other hostages.

1002
01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:59.440
and the injury of at least
100 surviving passengers and crew.

1003
01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:07.880
It was a shock to see Safarini
in shackles. surrounded by marshals.

1004
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.960
He looked very different.

1005
01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:21.360
I thought he looked
a pathetic. broken man.

1006
01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:25.720
I do remember calling him a murderer

1007
01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:29.680
and how he cost the lives
of many people.

1008
01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:31.560
and how he just didn't hurt them.

1009
01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:34.560
he hurt their loved ones
and their family.

1010
01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:36.640
He spoke with a dead voice.

1011
01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:39.240
like. "I am sorry
for what happened. blah. blah."

1012
01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:42.600
Like. no remorse at all.

1013
01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:46.240
I don't think that any apology
that he could've given

1014
01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:48.640
would have remotely satisfied

1015
01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:51.400
the people who were
so angry with him.

1016
01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:56.280
I'll be very honest. I didn't wish
a death penalty for him.

1017
01:22:56.280 --> 01:23:01.760
simply because that would be
too sweet and too sudden for him.

1018
01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:05.640
Mr Safarini.
you have pleaded guilty.

1019
01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:07.760
Are you prepared to be sentenced?

1020
01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.280
The sentence that he was given.

1021
01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:13.920
it almost sounds medieval.

1022
01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:17.400
The total agreed-upon sentence...

1023
01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:21.600
...is 160 years in prison.

1024
01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:30.320
I'm disappointed.
I think he deserves worse.

1025
01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:32.920
Tell us now what you told the court

1026
01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:35.200
about what you'd like to do
with the defendant.

1027
01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:37.360
No. not on camera.

1028
01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:43.960
He's gonna live his life
thinking about why he's there.

1029
01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:45.840
And I hope he suffers.

1030
01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:50.040
I got a call
from several family members.

1031
01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:52.280
Effectively.
what I do is I pursue claims

1032
01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:54.120
against sovereign governments.

1033
01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:57.160
They came to me and said. "We've
read about you. heard about you.

1034
01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:00.160
Do you think you could take on
our case against Libya for PA73?

1035
01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:02.720
That's what we want. Justice.

1036
01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:05.960
We want a judge to say
Libya did it."

1037
01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:08.840
And we were fairly close
to going to trial.

1038
01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:15.520
But... there's a bigger diplomatic
stage beyond the courtroom.

1039
01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:18.520
Politics will trump justice.

1040
01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:23.960
And after 9/11.
things changed dramatically.

1041
01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:28.240
Blair made his trip to the desert
to welcome Muammar Gaddafi

1042
01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:30.360
back in from the cold.

1043
01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:33.600
Gaddafi had got out
of the terrorism business.

1044
01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:36.920
He actually was cooperating
on going after Al-Qaeda.

1045
01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:42.400
And he was back on the world stage.
Extraordinary. A mass murderer.

1046
01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:47.600
Gaddafi gave up his WMD
and he gave the West what it wanted.

1047
01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:51.320
Clean oil. easy to get.
cheap to transport.

1048
01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:53.720
You now have Gaddafi
as a source of intel

1049
01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:56.240
rather than
as the focus of the intel.

1050
01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.160
In 2008. President Bush and Gaddafi
entered into

1051
01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:05.440
a $1.5 billion settlement

1052
01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:08.720
to resolve all pending cases
against Libya.

1053
01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:15.000
Pan Am 73 was one of them.

1054
01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.680
but only Americans
are included in the settlement.

1055
01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:24.000
How about food
and something to drink?

1056
01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.360
Passengers must have been asking
plenty of questions.

1057
01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:28.800
From the beginning.
there was no panic.

1058
01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:32.240
Passengers were calm
and supportive of our efforts.

1059
01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:35.800
We were. as much as it was possible.
in low voices.

1060
01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:38.000
keeping passengers...

1061
01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:14.840
They had an awards ceremony
where the hijack crew got a pen.

1062
01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:17.240
It has the Pan Am logo on it.

1063
01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:21.800
A gift for your...
Yeah. For...

1064
01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:24.920
For whatever. Our bravery.

1065
01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:28.360
I don't know what it was for.
It was just a gesture.

1066
01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:33.720
And. erm...
yep. I've kept it all these years.

1067
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:39.040
And this is a letter
from one of the passengers.

1068
01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:42.160
"I want you to know
how appreciative I am

1069
01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.960
of the courageous action you took

1070
01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:46.640
in hiding the passports
of the American passengers.

1071
01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:50.200
My sincere thanks
for your quick thinking and bravery.

1072
01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:52.560
I hope to hear from you soon."

1073
01:26:56.480 --> 01:27:00.600
That's a nice letter.
Yeah. it is. It was... It was nice.

1074
01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:03.480
I didn't expect anything like that.

1075
01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:06.400
Because everyone was so traumatised.
you know.

1076
01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:09.000
But it... it was nice of him.

1077
01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:18.240
I get flashbacks of what happened

1078
01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:21.360
and I... think a lot of it
was guilt.

1079
01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:28.760
And I think that was the most
difficult thing to carry on with.

1080
01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:35.400
Not because I survived.
but because I couldn't do more.

1081
01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:49.240
And these are some letters
that I wrote to and received

1082
01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:51.560
from Zaid Safarini in jail.

1083
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.480
In the supermax facility.

1084
01:27:56.480 --> 01:28:00.080
I wrote. really. because I thought

1085
01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:02.720
if he were to say publicly

1086
01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:05.400
that he now realised
it was a mistake.

1087
01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:08.520
that might discourage
somebody. somewhere

1088
01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:11.080
from doing something similar. Erm...

1089
01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:15.440
I asked him the questions
that I wanted answers to.

1090
01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:19.440
I've never understood what triggered
the end of the hijack

1091
01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:21.480
and the violence.

1092
01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:25.560
He said. "I will be more than glad

1093
01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:27.880
to discuss with you
any subject you wish to talk about.

1094
01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:31.400
I strongly believe this is
your basic right to know everything.

1095
01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.600
If you wish.
you can send me your phone number

1096
01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:37.840
and I will try to call you one day."

1097
01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:11.680
Yes.

1098
01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:31.720
I just wonder. what did you hope
would happen?"Ohh."

1099
01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:34.760
Do you remember?

1100
01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:29.560
I was expecting
that you would shoot me.

1101
01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:31.880
And you didn't. you know.

1102
01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:34.040
You put me back with the others.

1103
01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:44.920
My brother had died in the mountains. yes.

1104
01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:53.400
Wow.

1105
01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:10.160
Thank you. Zaid. Goodbye.
"Bye-bye."

1106
01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:23.400
It doesn't really change
how awful it was

1107
01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:26.400
for all those people. It just...

1108
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:31.480
...makes me feel
that my brother saved my life.

1109
01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:45.760
This is a picture of my brother. Imran.

1110
01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:54.360
I named my son after my brother

1111
01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:57.120
and he has all the qualities
of my brother.

1112
01:31:57.120 --> 01:32:01.400
- He's very brave.
- Oh. my God.
He's something else.

1113
01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:05.040
Sometimes it feels like
he has his soul.

1114
01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:07.080
He's very bold.

1115
01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:11.320
He's very kind. compassionate. And...

1116
01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:16.360
...actually.
he's the reason I am alive.
