3
00:13:02.616 --> 00:13:05.122
What am I doing here?

4
00:13:13.363 --> 00:13:15.231
What am I doing here?

5
00:13:46.627 --> 00:13:47.296
Hello?

6
00:13:56.076 --> 00:13:57.042
Is anyone there?

7
00:16:26.325 --> 00:16:31.427
I'm somewhere safe they say.

8
00:16:35.466 --> 00:16:38.797
This is in the ocean.

9
00:16:38.832 --> 00:16:40.172
It's warm.

10
00:16:44.343 --> 00:16:45.738
The sun touches my face.

11
00:17:10.237 --> 00:17:11.071
You're here.

12
00:17:14.505 --> 00:17:15.570
I can see you.

13
00:17:23.646 --> 00:17:25.085
Everything will be fine.

14
00:17:40.234 --> 00:17:45.468
Dawn. where did you go?

15
00:17:57.878 --> 00:17:59.185
Where the hell am I?

16
00:18:47.994 --> 00:18:53.239
I know this is stupid. but I
don't have any better ideas.

17
00:19:02.316 --> 00:19:02.809
I don't know.

18
00:19:05.616 --> 00:19:07.319
Maybe I can get
someone's attention.

19
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:23.962
It's no different than
talking to you in person.

20
00:20:00.308 --> 00:20:00.900
You left.

21
00:21:59.856 --> 00:22:00.921
I'm sorry. sir.

22
00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:04.793
I'm facing the ocean.

23
00:22:07.666 --> 00:22:09.765
I swear.

24
00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.371
This one touches my face.

25
00:22:16.037 --> 00:22:16.739
You're here.

26
00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.446
I could see you.

27
00:22:27.818 --> 00:22:29.048
Everything will be fine.

28
00:24:15.662 --> 00:24:16.122
Oh.

29
00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:58.637
Fuck you.

30
00:25:11.377 --> 00:25:12.178
Fuck you.

31
00:25:26.667 --> 00:25:27.127
Hello?

32
00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:32.330
Hello?

33
00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:04.269
Hello!

34
00:26:06.905 --> 00:26:08.102
Is anyone over there?

35
00:26:15.342 --> 00:26:16.044
Hello!

36
00:26:27.057 --> 00:26:29.926
Is anyone over there?

37
00:26:29.961 --> 00:26:31.631
Is anyone over there?

38
00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:41.872
Clearly.

39
00:26:41.907 --> 00:26:42.708
Is it clear?

40
00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:51.046
Can you tell me
what I'm doing here.

41
00:26:51.081 --> 00:26:55.347
I would tell you
but I didn't do it.

42
00:26:57.956 --> 00:27:00.924
You didn't do what?

43
00:27:00.959 --> 00:27:04.224
Did they give you a chair?

44
00:27:04.259 --> 00:27:06.424
No. they didn't give me.

45
00:27:13.433 --> 00:27:14.465
Who are they?

46
00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:15.741
They put us here.

47
00:27:20.913 --> 00:27:23.078
Do you know who they are?

48
00:27:23.113 --> 00:27:25.212
I don't know their names.

49
00:27:25.247 --> 00:27:27.412
OK but-- but you know
what they look like?

50
00:27:34.421 --> 00:27:40.799
I-- I asked you a question. do
you know what they look like?

51
00:27:40.834 --> 00:27:42.801
I don't know what you look like.

52
00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:48.169
This is going to--

53
00:27:56.410 --> 00:28:04.020
Look. I'm-- listen. let's
start with the name.

54
00:28:04.055 --> 00:28:05.120
Name?

55
00:28:05.155 --> 00:28:09.256
Yeah. as in-- as in your name.

56
00:28:09.291 --> 00:28:12.325
It's not very comfortable
sitting on the floor. is it?

57
00:28:21.303 --> 00:28:24.909
How do you know that I'm
sitting on the floor?

58
00:28:24.944 --> 00:28:27.406
When you responded to my
question about the chair.

59
00:28:30.818 --> 00:28:31.916
I don't have a chair.

60
00:28:35.317 --> 00:28:40.991
Look. my name is Nell.

61
00:28:41.026 --> 00:28:42.520
Hello. fish.

62
00:28:42.555 --> 00:28:43.763
Welcome to the barrel.

63
00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:51.331
It's-- it's-- it's
short for Inelle.

64
00:28:51.366 --> 00:28:53.465
That's a strange name

65
00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:55.368
I like it.

66
00:28:55.403 --> 00:28:57.843
Me too.

67
00:28:57.878 --> 00:28:59.405
Travis.

68
00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:02.177
OK. Travis. why
don't you tell me

69
00:29:02.212 --> 00:29:03.948
about that room
you're in over there?

70
00:29:14.092 --> 00:29:15.927
I guess I'll go first.

71
00:29:23.596 --> 00:29:24.265
It's empty.

72
00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:28.808
And it's cold.

73
00:29:32.275 --> 00:29:33.813
There's no chair.

74
00:29:38.919 --> 00:29:48.091
Three of the walls are concrete
maybe and one of the walls

75
00:29:48.126 --> 00:29:50.555
is drywall I guess.

76
00:29:54.902 --> 00:29:57.496
And there's something
painted on the wall.

77
00:29:57.531 --> 00:29:58.871
It's a--

78
00:29:58.906 --> 00:29:59.872
A number.

79
00:30:05.539 --> 00:30:06.945
Yeah.

80
00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:07.440
Six.

81
00:30:11.182 --> 00:30:12.280
No. it's a nine.

82
00:30:16.583 --> 00:30:19.958
The wall I'm at has a
big industrial door.

83
00:30:19.993 --> 00:30:20.860
Knock. knock.

84
00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:33.334
And above it there's a speaker--

85
00:30:33.369 --> 00:30:36.436
Knock. knock.

86
00:30:39.309 --> 00:30:40.572
Please cut it out.

87
00:30:43.445 --> 00:30:46.446
The sound comes from the horn
when the green lights come on.

88
00:30:51.057 --> 00:30:59.591
Yeah. and the wall across from
me has an LED clock installed.

89
00:31:04.202 --> 00:31:07.203
They're both too high to reach.

90
00:31:07.238 --> 00:31:08.633
What does your clock read?

91
00:31:11.341 --> 00:31:16.080
Right now it's 41
minutes in change.

92
00:31:16.115 --> 00:31:17.015
It's counting.

93
00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:18.016
It's counting down now.

94
00:31:20.449 --> 00:31:28.455
Yeah. the only other
things that I have--

95
00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:32.195
Are you comfortable?

96
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:33.526
Why would you ask me that?

97
00:31:40.304 --> 00:31:41.732
Travis.

98
00:31:41.767 --> 00:31:42.469
Nell.

99
00:31:45.045 --> 00:31:47.375
Why would you ask me
if I'm comfortable?

100
00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:48.706
It's a polite thing to ask.

101
00:31:51.381 --> 00:31:52.985
I'm not very comfortable.

102
00:31:55.748 --> 00:31:56.417
Right.

103
00:32:01.655 --> 00:32:06.262
The only other thing
that I have is this--

104
00:32:06.297 --> 00:32:07.131
The rope.

105
00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:15.502
Yeah.

106
00:32:21.114 --> 00:32:22.608
It's enough to hang myself with.

107
00:32:36.393 --> 00:32:40.164
I can't do that anymore.

108
00:32:40.199 --> 00:32:41.693
Not now.

109
00:32:41.728 --> 00:32:42.430
Why?

110
00:32:45.765 --> 00:32:50.405
There's a latch up
there on the skylight.

111
00:32:59.614 --> 00:33:01.449
They was calling out to me.

112
00:33:06.324 --> 00:33:10.062
It's broken now-- the latch.

113
00:33:22.109 --> 00:33:25.374
Did you even try to get out
of here before you gave up

114
00:33:25.409 --> 00:33:26.573
and you decided--

115
00:33:26.608 --> 00:33:28.047
There are a lot of
moving parts to this.

116
00:33:38.752 --> 00:33:43.359
What does that mean. parts?

117
00:33:43.394 --> 00:33:44.096
The room.

118
00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:53.237
What is wrong with you?

119
00:33:53.272 --> 00:33:55.107
Let's put a pin in that.

120
00:33:58.508 --> 00:34:01.410
What happens if I try
to climb out of here?

121
00:34:01.445 --> 00:34:02.675
The latch won't hold.

122
00:34:06.384 --> 00:34:08.219
How hard can it be?

123
00:34:08.254 --> 00:34:10.188
You're not
understanding me. fish.

124
00:34:14.293 --> 00:34:16.590
Yeah. that's an understatement.

125
00:34:16.625 --> 00:34:19.428
The latch will not hold.

126
00:34:28.307 --> 00:34:28.800
No.

127
00:34:32.839 --> 00:34:35.312
What?

128
00:34:35.347 --> 00:34:39.382
Do you know how to tie the
knot that's tamper proof. one

129
00:34:39.417 --> 00:34:40.746
that no one can break for you?

130
00:35:08.644 --> 00:35:10.182
You shouldn't do this.

131
00:35:14.452 --> 00:35:15.616
That's not the way out.

132
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:53.252
Nell?

133
00:36:55.652 --> 00:36:56.552
Nell?

134
00:37:37.089 --> 00:37:39.661
I fell.

135
00:37:39.696 --> 00:37:40.464
Come closer.

136
00:38:21.837 --> 00:38:24.101
Nell. you're still here.

137
00:38:30.549 --> 00:38:31.515
Still here?

138
00:38:33.816 --> 00:38:34.815
That was right.

139
00:38:40.658 --> 00:38:41.723
Yeah. Travis.

140
00:38:51.064 --> 00:38:53.570
I think I've done
something to my shoulder.

141
00:38:53.605 --> 00:38:54.373
Does it hurt?

142
00:39:02.449 --> 00:39:04.174
Yeah.

143
00:39:04.209 --> 00:39:05.780
You fix it.

144
00:39:05.815 --> 00:39:08.079
Find a hard surface.
pressure your arm against--

145
00:39:08.114 --> 00:39:18.155
Travis. I'm not listening
to another word you say.

146
00:39:18.157 --> 00:39:23.930
Travis. I'm not listening
to another word you say.

147
00:39:23.965 --> 00:39:26.867
Probably best to fix it before
the adrenaline wears off.

148
00:40:38.776 --> 00:40:39.511
You're welcome.

149
00:41:07.904 --> 00:41:11.741
Who are you really?

150
00:41:11.776 --> 00:41:12.269
I'm Travis.

151
00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:17.648
Did you put me here?

152
00:41:17.683 --> 00:41:20.112
No. they did.

153
00:41:26.758 --> 00:41:28.824
Are you watching me?

154
00:41:28.859 --> 00:41:30.287
I'm listening.

155
00:41:33.897 --> 00:41:34.863
Nell. Nell.

156
00:42:41.866 --> 00:42:44.735
Travis. you know this song?

157
00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:45.703
It's a favorite.

158
00:42:53.405 --> 00:42:54.272
Who's it by?

159
00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:11.828
Travis. who sings this--

160
00:43:11.863 --> 00:43:12.664
Hello. stranger.

161
00:43:20.102 --> 00:43:21.134
Hello to you too.

162
00:43:24.172 --> 00:43:27.844
Someone special played
that song for me

163
00:43:27.879 --> 00:43:29.406
when I was younger I think.

164
00:43:33.346 --> 00:43:39.119
Strange it's-- it's comforting.

165
00:43:44.291 --> 00:43:49.701
There's something off about
it though. something dark.

166
00:44:16.796 --> 00:44:18.961
Are you hearing that?

167
00:44:18.996 --> 00:44:19.764
Hearing what?

168
00:44:28.335 --> 00:44:30.742
Nothing.

169
00:44:30.777 --> 00:44:31.776
Never mind.

170
00:44:31.811 --> 00:44:34.075
Nell. what are you worrying?

171
00:44:53.965 --> 00:44:57.428
Travis. I need to
ask you something.

172
00:44:57.463 --> 00:45:00.838
and I need you to
be honest with me.

173
00:45:00.873 --> 00:45:02.202
I only ever tell the truth.

174
00:45:07.242 --> 00:45:11.145
Did you put me
here in this room?

175
00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:13.147
I did not put you in your room.

176
00:45:16.383 --> 00:45:20.121
What happens when
this clock reaches 0?

177
00:45:20.156 --> 00:45:21.353
The lights will turn off.

178
00:45:24.589 --> 00:45:25.522
What does that mean?

179
00:45:28.593 --> 00:45:32.364
Have you been
through this before?

180
00:45:32.399 --> 00:45:37.171
Travis. how could that
unless you put me here

181
00:45:37.206 --> 00:45:38.876
or you've been
through this before?

182
00:45:44.444 --> 00:45:45.784
Answer me.

183
00:45:49.548 --> 00:45:53.858
The lights were shut off when
the clock reaches 15 minutes

184
00:45:53.893 --> 00:45:55.255
and then the door opens.

185
00:45:59.591 --> 00:46:00.260
Yeah.

186
00:46:03.496 --> 00:46:05.265
Yeah. that's what
happened before.

187
00:46:13.011 --> 00:46:14.505
How do I get out of here now?

188
00:46:17.378 --> 00:46:21.578
I don't have the answers
now. but together you and I

189
00:46:21.613 --> 00:46:22.414
can find them.

190
00:47:01.686 --> 00:47:02.388
Nell.

191
00:47:05.459 --> 00:47:08.031
Travis.

192
00:47:08.066 --> 00:47:09.461
How do you feel
about being here?

193
00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:25.015
I don't-- I feel--

194
00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:28.018
I feel angry.

195
00:47:28.053 --> 00:47:29.250
I feel frustrated.

196
00:47:32.156 --> 00:47:37.225
I feel abandoned and--

197
00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:38.424
and terrified.

198
00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:48.005
I just-- I just feel--

199
00:47:52.077 --> 00:47:54.946
Do you feel like somehow
you deserve to be here?

200
00:48:06.157 --> 00:48:09.356
I don't know how to answer that.

201
00:48:09.391 --> 00:48:13.393
It's a difficult
thing to consider.

202
00:48:13.428 --> 00:48:17.331
but I feel like
I should be here.

203
00:48:17.366 --> 00:48:19.366
like I don't deserve
to be anywhere else.

204
00:48:25.374 --> 00:48:27.440
Why would you say that?

205
00:48:27.475 --> 00:48:31.246
I haven't done well.

206
00:48:31.281 --> 00:48:34.315
What do you meet?

207
00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:36.581
I failed to meet expectations.

208
00:48:39.289 --> 00:48:41.421
Let those closest to me down.

209
00:48:58.539 --> 00:49:05.313
No one deserves to be put in
a place like this. Travis.

210
00:49:05.348 --> 00:49:10.516
especially for
something as harmless

211
00:49:10.551 --> 00:49:19.756
as-- as letting someone down is
just it's part of being human.

212
00:49:19.791 --> 00:49:20.526
That's funny.

213
00:49:24.565 --> 00:49:26.565
What?

214
00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:28.402
There are other points
of being human that

215
00:49:28.437 --> 00:49:30.569
are not so easily forgivable.

216
00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:33.770
Like?

217
00:49:36.445 --> 00:49:37.147
Like evil.

218
00:49:42.286 --> 00:49:53.064
Yeah. it had to take some kind
of evil to put me in this room.

219
00:49:53.099 --> 00:49:57.365
And that's assuming a
human being put us here.

220
00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:00.830
Could it mean something else?

221
00:50:00.865 --> 00:50:02.568
Divine intervention maybe.

222
00:50:06.607 --> 00:50:10.642
You think God put us here?

223
00:50:10.677 --> 00:50:14.481
Is His wrath not well cataloged?

224
00:50:14.516 --> 00:50:17.187
Punishing those who
deserve it with situations

225
00:50:17.222 --> 00:50:18.716
fitting their trespasses.

226
00:50:24.361 --> 00:50:31.168
God created man and
man put us here.

227
00:50:34.239 --> 00:50:37.141
So I guess that
makes some sense.

228
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:52.420
We're here by God's
will and man's hand

229
00:50:52.455 --> 00:50:54.191
if you believe and
that kind of thing.

230
00:51:25.653 --> 00:51:26.817
What are you doing here?

231
00:51:33.925 --> 00:51:42.668
Travis. Travis. what's
happening over there?

232
00:51:42.703 --> 00:51:44.604
What do you want with me?

233
00:51:44.639 --> 00:51:52.216
Travis. Travis. Travis.

234
00:51:52.251 --> 00:51:53.184
No. no. no. no. no. no.

235
00:51:53.219 --> 00:51:55.450
What's happening to you?

236
00:51:55.485 --> 00:51:57.518
Travis. please say something.

237
00:51:57.553 --> 00:51:58.486
Get away from me.

238
00:51:58.521 --> 00:52:00.290
Who's over there with you?

239
00:52:00.325 --> 00:52:00.884
Don't please.

240
00:52:00.919 --> 00:52:01.423
I'm begging you.

241
00:52:01.458 --> 00:52:01.918
Don't.

242
00:52:01.953 --> 00:52:02.552
No!

243
00:52:02.587 --> 00:52:06.197
Travis. answer me please.

244
00:52:06.232 --> 00:52:06.725
Don't!

245
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:16.669
Travis.

246
00:52:26.945 --> 00:52:27.746
I'm sweating.

247
00:52:30.949 --> 00:52:32.520
I'm somewhere safe.

248
00:52:32.555 --> 00:52:34.489
I'm facing the ocean.

249
00:52:34.524 --> 00:52:36.524
It's warm.

250
00:52:36.559 --> 00:52:40.231
The sun touches my face.

251
00:52:40.266 --> 00:52:40.990
I could see you.

252
00:52:41.025 --> 00:52:42.266
Everything will be fine.

253
00:52:42.301 --> 00:52:45.731
Everything will be fine.

254
00:52:45.766 --> 00:52:50.241
Everything is fine.
it's fine. it's fine.

255
00:52:57.811 --> 00:52:58.348
Travis.

256
00:53:02.387 --> 00:53:03.782
Travis. what happened to you?

257
00:53:07.458 --> 00:53:07.918
I did it.

258
00:53:11.429 --> 00:53:12.560
No. you didn't.

259
00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:17.334
You talk to me please.

260
00:53:19.767 --> 00:53:22.372
Maybe-- Maybe I can--

261
00:53:26.675 --> 00:53:27.905
maybe we can help each other.

262
00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:29.676
There are signs in the sky.

263
00:53:32.714 --> 00:53:33.911
Do you see them now?

264
00:53:55.341 --> 00:53:58.342
You're hurt.

265
00:53:58.377 --> 00:54:00.069
They hurt you.

266
00:54:00.104 --> 00:54:01.741
He was here to fix me.

267
00:54:09.916 --> 00:54:12.587
He?

268
00:54:12.622 --> 00:54:16.085
Who was he. Travis?

269
00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:17.691
Did you recognize him?

270
00:54:22.830 --> 00:54:25.864
How did he get in here?

271
00:54:30.442 --> 00:54:32.706
Nell.

272
00:54:32.741 --> 00:54:37.414
Yes. Travis. talk to me.

273
00:54:37.449 --> 00:54:40.076
Tell me what happened to you.

274
00:54:40.111 --> 00:54:41.044
My head hurts.

275
00:54:44.456 --> 00:54:48.920
OK. so he-- so he hits you.

276
00:54:48.955 --> 00:54:52.759
He hits you in the head with
something. but with what?

277
00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:05.904
Travis. Travis. I need
you to tell me everything

278
00:55:05.939 --> 00:55:08.973
you can about this man. OK?

279
00:55:09.008 --> 00:55:10.909
I'm going to help you get out.

280
00:55:10.944 --> 00:55:12.911
He said he just wanted to help.

281
00:55:16.917 --> 00:55:18.422
By torturing you?

282
00:55:22.923 --> 00:55:24.362
Hope for you too.

283
00:55:33.703 --> 00:55:36.803
What did he tell you?

284
00:55:36.838 --> 00:55:38.541
Travis. what did he say?

285
00:55:49.686 --> 00:55:53.017
I'm going to get
us out of here. OK?

286
00:55:53.052 --> 00:55:54.491
Will you help me with that?

287
00:55:56.825 --> 00:55:58.495
But after I get some rest.

288
00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:04.798
After you-- no. no. no. no. no.

289
00:56:04.833 --> 00:56:08.439
Travis. do not go to sleep.

290
00:56:12.170 --> 00:56:15.974
Travis. answer me.

291
00:56:19.584 --> 00:56:20.418
I'm here.

292
00:56:25.216 --> 00:56:25.984
I'm awake.

293
00:56:32.597 --> 00:56:34.091
No way.

294
00:56:34.126 --> 00:56:36.995
I think I just--

295
00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:42.473
I just need you to gather your
strength and stay awake. OK?

296
00:56:47.172 --> 00:56:48.941
I'm going to come
up with a plan.

297
00:56:51.011 --> 00:56:53.011
I'm going to figure
out a way out of here.

298
00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:57.587
Stay awake?

299
00:56:57.622 --> 00:56:59.490
Yeah.

300
00:56:59.525 --> 00:57:00.755
Yes. stay awake. OK?

301
00:57:00.790 --> 00:57:03.989
I need you to promise
me you'll stay awake.

302
00:57:04.024 --> 00:57:08.499
If you feel like you're
falling asleep just--

303
00:57:08.534 --> 00:57:09.764
just talk to me.

304
00:57:09.799 --> 00:57:10.864
Talk to you?

305
00:57:10.899 --> 00:57:14.197
Yeah. yeah. talk to me.

306
00:57:14.232 --> 00:57:15.099
I'm an open book.

307
00:57:17.675 --> 00:57:18.872
Open book?

308
00:57:18.907 --> 00:57:21.941
Yeah. ask me anything.

309
00:57:45.296 --> 00:57:47.670
Do you really think
I put you here?

310
00:57:54.305 --> 00:58:01.981
I did. but now I think
we need to work together.

311
00:58:06.218 --> 00:58:07.184
Thanks.

312
00:58:07.219 --> 00:58:07.921
For what?

313
00:58:10.222 --> 00:58:14.796
For caring. for trusting me.

314
00:58:14.831 --> 00:58:17.931
I don't really have
much of a choice.

315
00:58:17.966 --> 00:58:18.431
Why's that?

316
00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:24.135
You're all I've got.

317
00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:25.004
In here.

318
00:58:33.718 --> 00:58:35.047
What?

319
00:58:35.082 --> 00:58:37.148
I'm all you have in here.

320
00:58:37.183 --> 00:58:40.217
You have someone out
there who cares about you.

321
00:59:00.679 --> 00:59:01.139
I do.

322
00:59:03.847 --> 00:59:04.615
I did.

323
00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:17.188
Travis. have you ever--

324
00:59:20.292 --> 00:59:27.671
have you ever lost someone.
someone close to you?

325
00:59:32.777 --> 00:59:38.176
More than close. irreplaceable.

326
00:59:38.211 --> 00:59:39.716
She was the one that--

327
00:59:52.192 --> 00:59:53.323
What happened to her?

328
00:59:55.932 --> 00:59:57.030
Did she leave?

329
01:00:05.436 --> 01:00:10.681
I'm sorry. I have no
business asking you if--

330
01:00:10.716 --> 01:00:13.376
She abandoned me.

331
01:00:13.411 --> 01:00:14.278
I was a failure.

332
01:00:29.064 --> 01:00:30.360
I lost someone recently.

333
01:00:34.432 --> 01:00:37.774
She was there 1 minute
and gone the next.

334
01:00:43.111 --> 01:00:44.715
It happened that quick.

335
01:01:02.163 --> 01:01:08.101
Travis. have you
noticed anything strange

336
01:01:08.136 --> 01:01:13.942
about yourself. something
that guy might have

337
01:01:13.977 --> 01:01:15.306
done to us when he put us here?

338
01:01:20.951 --> 01:01:22.478
I've got this thing
under my skin.

339
01:01:25.153 --> 01:01:27.153
Does yours itch?

340
01:01:27.188 --> 01:01:30.057
Mine itches.

341
01:01:30.092 --> 01:01:33.159
Where did you find yours?

342
01:01:33.194 --> 01:01:35.832
My upper arm.

343
01:01:35.867 --> 01:01:36.734
Mine's in my leg.

344
01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:40.331
Different places.

345
01:01:43.072 --> 01:01:44.401
I don't make it easy for him.

346
01:01:47.846 --> 01:01:49.747
You remember being put in?

347
01:01:54.248 --> 01:01:57.282
I can't remember any of it.

348
01:01:57.317 --> 01:01:58.921
Consider yourself lucky.

349
01:02:01.959 --> 01:02:03.354
I don't believe in luck. Travis.

350
01:02:07.261 --> 01:02:10.867
We're running out of time.

351
01:02:10.902 --> 01:02:12.198
I will always have an vent.

352
01:02:51.635 --> 01:02:58.574
Travis. Travis. you're
not talking to me.

353
01:02:58.609 --> 01:03:00.477
You have to stay
awake. you promised.

354
01:03:04.252 --> 01:03:05.416
Oh. yeah.

355
01:03:12.458 --> 01:03:14.293
I think I'm ready
for that joke now.

356
01:03:19.498 --> 01:03:21.168
Nell. Nell.

357
01:03:21.203 --> 01:03:22.972
Sir.

358
01:03:23.007 --> 01:03:24.270
Construction.

359
01:03:24.305 --> 01:03:26.976
Construction helps.

360
01:03:27.011 --> 01:03:28.604
So are we still working on it?

361
01:03:31.345 --> 01:03:33.345
Well. worth the wait.

362
01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:37.085
It is your own work.

363
01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:38.284
Everything will work.

364
01:04:05.181 --> 01:04:07.049
I'll go without sleep forever.

365
01:04:12.419 --> 01:04:16.256
Travis. Travis. I
think I figured out

366
01:04:16.291 --> 01:04:17.455
a way to get out of here.

367
01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:36.177
Travis. Travis. you're
not talking to me.

368
01:04:36.212 --> 01:04:37.277
Answer me.

369
01:04:44.748 --> 01:04:45.450
It's--

370
01:04:56.133 --> 01:04:58.562
I'm here.

371
01:04:58.597 --> 01:04:59.299
I'm awake.

372
01:05:04.438 --> 01:05:05.635
Get your broken latch.

373
01:05:19.453 --> 01:05:21.651
How's it coming?

374
01:05:21.686 --> 01:05:23.620
It's difficult.

375
01:05:23.655 --> 01:05:26.227
I know.

376
01:05:26.262 --> 01:05:27.690
You're hurt and--
and you're tired.

377
01:05:36.734 --> 01:05:41.077
I just-- I need you
to focus for me. OK?

378
01:05:41.112 --> 01:05:43.112
For both of us.

379
01:05:43.147 --> 01:05:45.983
It's much more effective to
keep me awake than talking.

380
01:07:50.670 --> 01:07:54.177
Travis. Travis.
look what I found.

381
01:08:02.352 --> 01:08:03.219
It was in the wall.

382
01:08:19.336 --> 01:08:22.931
That's true for the bolt.

383
01:08:22.966 --> 01:08:25.571
Let me see if I can get a
better look from my side.

384
01:09:48.392 --> 01:09:48.885
Yeah.

385
01:10:32.095 --> 01:10:42.411
Travis. Travis. answer me.

386
01:10:49.981 --> 01:10:51.552
Nell.

387
01:10:51.587 --> 01:10:52.685
I'm here.

388
01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:55.050
Nell. he's going
to come back now.

389
01:10:55.085 --> 01:10:57.426
You should have left
the camera on the wall.

390
01:10:57.461 --> 01:10:58.691
Travis. we don't know that.

391
01:10:58.726 --> 01:11:01.859
You should have stayed
out of the

392
01:11:01.894 --> 01:11:05.830
I just need you
to stay calm. OK?

393
01:11:05.865 --> 01:11:07.964
I just need you to
focus on the bolts.

394
01:11:30.626 --> 01:11:31.559
I got it.

395
01:12:48.066 --> 01:12:51.771
Two more bolts
left. halfway there.

396
01:12:51.806 --> 01:12:53.542
My latch broke before
I could finish.

397
01:12:59.583 --> 01:13:00.813
We need to hurry.

398
01:13:00.848 --> 01:13:02.078
We're running out of time.

399
01:13:11.694 --> 01:13:13.958
Stop what you're doing.

400
01:13:13.993 --> 01:13:17.665
Grab hold of your vent and
pull as hard as you can.

401
01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:19.832
It's bolted up to the concrete.

402
01:13:19.867 --> 01:13:20.998
The light's going to come over.

403
01:13:21.033 --> 01:13:22.230
He's going to come back.

404
01:13:22.265 --> 01:13:24.705
Travis. stay focused.

405
01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:25.937
We're almost there.

406
01:13:25.972 --> 01:13:27.235
I'm somewhere safe.

407
01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:28.137
I'm facing the ocean.

408
01:13:28.172 --> 01:13:28.704
It's warm.

409
01:13:28.739 --> 01:13:31.206
The sun touches my face.

410
01:13:31.241 --> 01:13:32.009
You're in here?

411
01:13:32.044 --> 01:13:32.509
Yes.

412
01:13:32.545 --> 01:13:34.484
Travis. I'm here.

413
01:13:34.519 --> 01:13:35.584
Listen to my voice.

414
01:13:35.619 --> 01:13:36.211
I'm here.

415
01:13:40.756 --> 01:13:44.593
I know this sounds
crazy. but grab the vent

416
01:13:44.628 --> 01:13:47.596
and pull as hard as you can.

417
01:13:47.631 --> 01:13:49.994
I'll grab the vent and pool.

418
01:13:50.029 --> 01:13:52.260
What are you waiting for?

419
01:13:52.295 --> 01:13:53.129
Just do it.

420
01:14:12.557 --> 01:14:16.053
No. no. no. no. no. no. no.

421
01:14:16.088 --> 01:14:20.926
Travis. Travis. not again. no.

422
01:14:37.813 --> 01:14:39.010
I'm somewhere safe.

423
01:14:41.949 --> 01:14:43.146
I'm facing the ocean.

424
01:14:47.218 --> 01:14:49.691
It's warm.

425
01:14:49.726 --> 01:14:51.220
The sun touches my face.

426
01:14:53.928 --> 01:14:56.632
You are here.

427
01:14:56.667 --> 01:15:00.064
I can see you. everything.

428
01:15:04.367 --> 01:15:05.036
No.

429
01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:10.173
I'm not safe.

430
01:15:12.914 --> 01:15:16.080
I don't even know what safe is.

431
01:15:19.085 --> 01:15:20.282
There's no sign here.

432
01:15:23.254 --> 01:15:26.354
You're not here.

433
01:15:26.389 --> 01:15:28.257
Nothing is fine.

434
01:17:12.033 --> 01:17:15.034
What do you want from me?

435
01:17:15.069 --> 01:17:16.068
I'll do it.

436
01:17:18.468 --> 01:17:19.335
I'll do it.

437
01:17:31.052 --> 01:17:32.315
This is what you want?

438
01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:48.804
Good.

439
01:17:52.139 --> 01:17:53.908
Green's low.

440
01:17:53.943 --> 01:17:56.878
Yellow's-- Yellow is medium.

441
01:18:00.114 --> 01:18:02.917
It's a sound
pressure meter.

442
01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:06.085
It's a sound level.

443
01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:11.420
Green. yellow. red.

444
01:21:58.781 --> 01:21:59.450
Travis.

445
01:22:05.755 --> 01:22:06.996
No. no. this is real.

446
01:22:18.438 --> 01:22:22.308
No. no. just shoot the wall.

447
01:22:22.343 --> 01:22:25.212
Travis. don't shoot yourself.

448
01:22:25.247 --> 01:22:27.643
Travis. please don't
shoot yourself.

449
01:22:30.219 --> 01:22:33.715
Just take your gun shoot
something else. something else.

450
01:24:42.945 --> 01:24:46.287
If we've done what
we're setting out to do.

451
01:24:46.322 --> 01:24:48.520
then we've done a difference.

452
01:24:48.555 --> 01:24:50.753
So when the world's
borders get too difficult.

Director Dawn Summers.

512
01:27:42.696 --> 01:27:44.531
Director Summers is
currently overseeing

513
01:27:44.566 --> 01:27:46.929
the day to day operations from
our new campus which we're

514
01:27:46.964 --> 01:27:49.096
currently in transition to.

515
01:27:49.131 --> 01:27:51.340
How exciting?

516
01:27:51.375 --> 01:27:52.000
Excuse us.

517
01:27:57.744 --> 01:27:59.843
Are we going to get to see
any of the active trials?

518
01:27:59.878 --> 01:28:01.944
Unfortunately.
today trials are--

519
01:30:41.303 --> 01:30:42.742
I apologize for that.

520
01:30:42.777 --> 01:30:45.943
I want to be sure
you were mobilized.

521
01:30:45.978 --> 01:30:47.043
Can't be too careful.

522
01:31:00.828 --> 01:31:01.992
ah man

523
01:31:08.132 --> 01:31:09.934
It sure is pretty out here.

524
01:31:14.171 --> 01:31:16.776
It's designed for the trials.

525
01:31:16.811 --> 01:31:18.008
It's designed for you.

526
01:31:20.243 --> 01:31:24.949
But every once in a while we get
to come out here and enjoy it

527
01:31:24.984 --> 01:31:27.952
for ourselves.

528
01:31:27.987 --> 01:31:29.657
Perks of the job.

529
01:31:32.893 --> 01:31:36.026
At any rate. I'm going to start
by asking you a series of yes

530
01:31:36.061 --> 01:31:39.931
or no questions regarding
your experience in the barrel.

531
01:31:39.966 --> 01:31:41.999
Who are you?

532
01:31:42.034 --> 01:31:44.298
Why are you keeping me here?

533
01:31:44.333 --> 01:31:49.776
I'm Edgar and you'll be able
to walk again when we're done.

534
01:31:49.811 --> 01:31:52.042
So let's-- OK.

535
01:31:52.077 --> 01:31:54.946
Question number one.
any point in time.

536
01:31:54.981 --> 01:31:56.717
did you find the
trial to be stressful?

537
01:31:56.752 --> 01:31:58.147
Where's Travis?

538
01:31:58.182 --> 01:32:00.116
What did you do with him?

539
01:32:00.151 --> 01:32:01.920
Just answer the
question. please.

540
01:32:04.727 --> 01:32:06.353
Yes.

541
01:32:06.388 --> 01:32:07.254
Great.

542
01:32:07.289 --> 01:32:09.829
Question number two.
any point in time

543
01:32:09.864 --> 01:32:12.733
did you come to care about
the well-being of mod 6 a.k.a.

544
01:32:12.768 --> 01:32:13.261
Travis?

545
01:32:19.940 --> 01:32:23.843
What kind of question is that?

546
01:32:23.878 --> 01:32:28.276
What was the first thing you did
when you got out of the room?

547
01:32:28.311 --> 01:32:29.013
I--

548
01:32:32.150 --> 01:32:36.691
You didn't run.
you doubled back.

549
01:32:36.726 --> 01:32:38.253
To help him.

550
01:32:38.288 --> 01:32:40.255
Why?

551
01:32:40.290 --> 01:32:42.730
Because he would
do the same for me.

552
01:32:42.765 --> 01:32:43.632
Would he?

553
01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:49.737
Look. you were supposed to learn
to care about him. you did.

554
01:32:49.772 --> 01:32:50.331
That's yes.

555
01:32:50.366 --> 01:32:51.739
We're moving on.

556
01:32:51.774 --> 01:32:52.872
Next question.

557
01:32:52.907 --> 01:32:54.940
Any point in time
did you come to--

558
01:32:54.975 --> 01:32:56.810
Where's Dawn?

559
01:32:56.845 --> 01:32:59.879
Director Summers?

560
01:32:59.914 --> 01:33:02.079
Director Summers
is all around us.

561
01:33:02.114 --> 01:33:03.784
It's the reason
why we're all here.

562
01:33:06.085 --> 01:33:08.151
It's actually a
giant pain in my ass.

563
01:33:08.186 --> 01:33:09.383
Please don't repeat that.

564
01:33:09.418 --> 01:33:10.617
What am I saying?

565
01:33:10.653 --> 01:33:12.991
You're not going to remember
any of this after today anyway.

566
01:33:15.930 --> 01:33:19.096
OK. where was I?

567
01:33:19.131 --> 01:33:22.935
Any point in time did you come
to question your humanity?

568
01:33:22.970 --> 01:33:24.101
Oh. that's a new one.

569
01:33:26.468 --> 01:33:28.908
My humanity?

570
01:33:28.943 --> 01:33:31.306
Yeah. you know.
like. I don't know.

571
01:33:31.341 --> 01:33:33.407
like if you're a
person or a human being

572
01:33:33.442 --> 01:33:36.047
or something like that.

573
01:33:36.082 --> 01:33:38.687
I don't-- I don't understand
what you're asking me.

574
01:33:42.220 --> 01:33:44.990
You just let him die.

575
01:33:45.025 --> 01:33:46.288
You just watched as he--

576
01:33:55.871 --> 01:33:59.103
Residue probably
from a fall earlier.

577
01:33:59.138 --> 01:34:01.875
No. we'll get in there
and clean that up.

578
01:34:01.910 --> 01:34:03.173
OK. like I was
saying. at any point

579
01:34:03.208 --> 01:34:04.944
in time did you come
to question your--

580
01:34:04.979 --> 01:34:05.813
Who am I?

581
01:34:05.848 --> 01:34:07.848
--humanity. right?

582
01:34:07.883 --> 01:34:09.476
That's a yes. OK.

583
01:34:09.511 --> 01:34:11.082
Next question.

584
01:34:11.117 --> 01:34:13.216
Have I been here before?

585
01:34:13.251 --> 01:34:20.025
Yeah. day after day. week
after week until they

586
01:34:20.060 --> 01:34:23.160
work out all the bugs
and move on to mod 10.

587
01:34:23.195 --> 01:34:24.865
I'll decide when
the time is right.

588
01:34:27.199 --> 01:34:28.066
Piece of shit.

589
01:34:28.101 --> 01:34:29.804
Come on now.

590
01:34:32.369 --> 01:34:35.040
All right. we're
back up and running.

591
01:34:35.075 --> 01:34:36.943
This isn't fair.

592
01:34:36.978 --> 01:34:40.177
Have I ever been
able to save him?

593
01:34:40.212 --> 01:34:41.508
No. it's not fair.

594
01:34:41.543 --> 01:34:43.279
He's having two mortgages
and paying child support

595
01:34:43.314 --> 01:34:47.822
on a kid you're not even sure
as yours. that's not fair.

596
01:34:47.857 --> 01:34:49.120
I wish somebody would save me.

597
01:34:49.155 --> 01:34:50.187
You're somewhere safe.

598
01:34:50.222 --> 01:34:52.156
I want to be saved.

599
01:34:53.423 --> 01:34:54.125
Hey.

600
01:34:55.293 --> 01:34:56.292
I can see the ocean.

601
01:34:58.230 --> 01:35:00.967
Look. you have to answer
all of these questions

602
01:35:01.002 --> 01:35:04.399
or they're going to repurpose
you like they did to him.

603
01:35:06.007 --> 01:35:07.006
It's warm.

604
01:35:11.980 --> 01:35:13.914
The sun touches my face.

605
01:35:16.952 --> 01:35:18.116
I'm somewhere safe.

606
01:35:19.152 --> 01:35:20.789
Alright.

607
01:35:23.453 --> 01:35:24.452
<i>I'm facing the ocean.</i>

608
01:35:25.455 --> 01:35:27.895
I got my kids this
weekend. I can't be late.

609
01:35:27.930 --> 01:35:31.525
I'm just going to docker and
we'll pick it up on Monday.

610
01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:32.229
It's warm.

611
01:35:35.036 --> 01:35:36.464
The sun touches my face.

612
01:35:41.911 --> 01:35:43.339
I'm somewhere safe.

613
01:35:46.608 --> 01:35:47.541
I'm facing the ocean.

614
01:35:50.513 --> 01:35:51.512
It's warm.

615
01:35:54.352 --> 01:35:56.286
<i>The sun touches my face.</i>

616
01:35:58.026 --> 01:36:01.225
<i>I'm somewhere safe.</i>

617
01:36:01.260 --> 01:36:02.963
<i>I'm facing the ocean.</i>

618
01:36:06.232 --> 01:36:07.396
<i>It's warm.</i>

619
01:36:12.238 --> 01:36:13.908
<i>The sun touches my face.</i>

620
01:36:16.374 --> 01:36:18.176
<i>I'm somewhere safe.</i>

621
01:36:20.983 --> 01:36:22.378
<i>I'm facing the ocean.</i>

622
01:36:24.888 --> 01:36:25.348
<i>It's warm.</i>

623
01:36:29.387 --> 01:36:31.156
<i>The sun touches my face.</i>
