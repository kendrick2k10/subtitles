You know what? Fine.

178
00:08:43.925 --> 00:08:45.266
But no calls.

179
00:08:45.365 --> 00:08:47.425
and no messages to take anyone out.

180
00:08:47.526 --> 00:08:49.766
I'm serious. Suzan. If anyone does…

181
00:08:50.486 --> 00:08:53.744
Somebody is gonna get it.

182
00:08:53.845 --> 00:08:55.145
Approved.

00:08:55.244 --> 00:08:56.585
-Fine.
-Great.

-Fine.
-Great.

186
00:09:00.685 --> 00:09:02.684
Great. Okay.

187
00:09:03.604 --> 00:09:05.604
Oh. and Bradley?

188
00:09:06.884 --> 00:09:08.884
Just remember. you are a spy.

189
00:09:09.364 --> 00:09:12.262
And you have a lot of enemies.

190
00:09:12.363 --> 00:09:14.883
More enemies than
all the other spies put together.

191
00:09:15.843 --> 00:09:18.022
Just… watch your back.

192
00:09:18.123 --> 00:09:22.722
Thanks for your hostility. Suzan.
Sorry. I meant hospitality.

193
00:09:25.442 --> 00:09:27.442
Fucking Suzan.

194
00:09:35.281 --> 00:09:37.281

Psst!

[whispers] No.

202
00:10:44.273 --> 00:10:45.854
We have a mission. brother!

203
00:10:45.954 --> 00:10:47.374
Finally. a mission!

204
00:10:47.473 --> 00:10:48.493
Yes!

205
00:10:48.594 --> 00:10:50.413
Okay. Here is plan.

Number one. We finish massage.

We finish massage.

And I always pay my debts. you know that.

235

Wanna know what happened to me last time?

They took away my satellite privileges
for. like. more than a week. man.

238
00:12:24.064 --> 00:12:25.564
I can't go through that shit again.

239
00:12:25.663 --> 00:12:29.023
James. you are the only one
that I can trust with this.

240
00:12:29.584 --> 00:12:32.304
-The only one.
-Really?

241
00:12:32.863 --> 00:12:34.863
Yes. Really.

242
00:12:35.782 --> 00:12:37.123
What do you need?

243
00:12:37.223 --> 00:12:39.583
Just do some background digging.

Holy shit. You're taking out The Vet?

245
00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:47.122
Not The Vet. I mean. she is a vet. but…

246
00:12:47.222 --> 00:12:48.321
Not The Vet.

247
00:12:48.422 --> 00:12:50.561
Well. I mean. who is she then?
Is she. like. a normal?

248
00:12:50.662 --> 00:12:52.362
Like. a standard human
with problems and stuff?

You know. find out what her hobbies are.

She what?

252

Have a boyfriend.
Does she have a boyfriend?

253
00:13:04.339 --> 00:13:07.000
No. No. I-- I can't. I can't do that.

254
00:13:07.099 --> 00:13:09.599
Brad. I really don't want to do this.
This makes me really…

255
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.720
-I can't do it. No. I'm not doing it!
-Whoa. whoa. James. relax.

256
00:13:12.819 --> 00:13:15.559
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I should. you know.

257
00:13:15.658 --> 00:13:17.398
look around for some new IT support.

258
00:13:17.499 --> 00:13:20.319
I mean. I did hear that you're buying
drones that your skills can't cash.

259
00:13:20.419 --> 00:13:22.759
Wait. who said that?
Did you talk to the union. man?

260
00:13:22.858 --> 00:13:23.798
Fuck those guys.

261
00:13:23.897 --> 00:13:27.758
I may be emotionally scarred. have anxiety
and depressive issues. I know that.

262
00:13:27.858 --> 00:13:30.498
But can you please sit down? Please?

263
00:13:34.057 --> 00:13:36.676
I know that you are the best.
That's why I came to you.

264

I just… I just don't understand it.

266
00:13:39.617 --> 00:13:41.156
You've had thousands
and thousands of girls before.

267

-I mean. you can get any girl you want.
-Yeah.

268
00:13:43.096 --> 00:13:44.996
But. y'know. they're
always assassin girls.

271
00:13:49.656 --> 00:13:51.656

273
00:13:55.254 --> 00:13:57.395

Especially Suzan.

-Yeah. sure. Fuck Suzan.
-Yeah. Fuck Suzan.

275
00:14:00.055 --> 00:14:03.314
Yeah. You know. I met this really cute
girl at the café a few days ago.

276
00:14:03.414 --> 00:14:05.874
Yeah. I really want to talk to her.
but I'm scared that…

277
00:14:05.973 --> 00:14:07.973
I dunno. I'm scared if I say anything.
she might…

278
00:14:08.854 --> 00:14:10.314
I dunno. She might slap me
across the face.

279
00:14:10.414 --> 00:14:11.513

They're the sons of the Russian oligarch
known as the Boss.

322
00:17:28.754 --> 00:17:31.134
Do we have any idea of their intentions?

323
00:17:31.234 --> 00:17:34.053
We have reason to believe that
the weapons will be used simultaneously

at seven locations around the world

325

326
00:17:38.473 --> 00:17:41.473
But you just said that they were
stolen from the Russians.

327
00:17:42.153 --> 00:17:43.773
Yes. that is correct.

328
00:17:43.873 --> 00:17:45.872
Right.

00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:48.372
I'm really confused right now.

330
00:17:48.472 --> 00:17:52.972
Intelligence believes that
Trident may have stolen the missiles.

331
00:17:53.072 --> 00:17:56.611
and then "may or may not"
have given them back to the Russians

332

that they must use their stolen missiles

333
00:18:00.031 --> 00:18:05.430
to attack seven locations around the world
that are currently "unknown" to us.

334

For fuck's sake. that's hardly
what I'd call "intelligence."

Find out whatever you can
about these hyperthingy thingies.

And get Roger back on the thingy-thingy

he find out how pathetic

-Oh. right here?

354
00:19:21.583 --> 00:19:24.083
You were told to wait right here
in this exact spot

355
00:19:24.183 --> 00:19:25.282
in the out-of-bounds area?

356
00:19:25.382 --> 00:19:26.802
-Right here?
-No. not right here.

357
00:19:26.902 --> 00:19:30.162
Yeah. no. I imagine not. because
it'd be incredibly stupid to allow

358
00:19:30.262 --> 00:19:33.922
-a white Caucasian male. early forties…
-Mid-thirties.

359
00:19:34.022 --> 00:19:36.641
…back here in the restricted.
special-people-only area.

360
00:19:36.741 --> 00:19:40.721
The exact demographic of 95%
of serial killers in the entire world.

361
00:19:40.821 --> 00:19:42.821
Okay. Well. that's good to know.

362
00:19:43.741 --> 00:19:47.520
Aww. Aren't they just so fucking pathetic.

363
00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.600
Do you have any idea
how many good-looking males

364
00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:53.040
walk through that door every day
with their bunch of amazing flowers

365
00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:54.959
and sick-dog routine and try and hit on V?

366
00:19:55.059 --> 00:19:56.199
That happens a lot?

367
00:19:56.299 --> 00:19:59.439
Yeah. and it's happening
by a good-looking serial killer right now.

368
00:19:59.539 --> 00:20:02.319
She hates flowers. by the way.
Just saying. FYI.

369
00:20:02.419 --> 00:20:04.319
She doesn't even like guys much.

370
00:20:04.419 --> 00:20:05.518
Oh.

371
00:20:05.618 --> 00:20:09.718
Oh. she's gay. I mean. not that
there's anything wrong with that.

372
00:20:09.818 --> 00:20:11.758
-No. that's not what I'm saying.
-You kinda did.

373
00:20:11.858 --> 00:20:13.858
Oh. Did I. serial killer?

374
00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:16.337
Okay…

375
00:20:16.897 --> 00:20:18.437
-You're back!
-Oh. hey!

376
00:20:18.537 --> 00:20:20.637
Wow. flowers? They're amazing.
are they for me?

377
00:20:20.737 --> 00:20:22.917
I'm kidding. of course they're not.

378
00:20:23.017 --> 00:20:25.916
But you know. that'd be super-weird.
They're obviously for your dog.

379
00:20:26.016 --> 00:20:29.456
That is super-thoughtful. I mean.
you know. that's pretty cute. right?

380
00:20:29.556 --> 00:20:30.736
Well. Pluto…

381
00:20:30.836 --> 00:20:32.976
You know what. I've just been telling him
how busy you've been.

382
00:20:33.076 --> 00:20:37.095
Like. 24/7 busy. you don't really
have any time for serial killers.

383
00:20:37.195 --> 00:20:38.815
Can you get Pluto from the back for me?

384
00:20:38.915 --> 00:20:40.495
Don't want to go get Pluto from the back--

385
00:20:40.595 --> 00:20:42.595
For me. Thank you.

386
00:20:43.915 --> 00:20:46.414
So. Pluto's X-ray came back.

387
00:20:46.514 --> 00:20:48.494
and she did break her leg. unfortunately.

388
00:20:48.594 --> 00:20:51.374
-Oh. that's terrible.
-But it's so fine. I put a splint on it.

389
00:20:51.474 --> 00:20:53.254
-So you can take her home today.
-Today?

390
00:20:53.354 --> 00:20:56.413
You've just got to keep an eye on her
for a week. but she is all yours.

391
00:20:56.513 --> 00:20:58.252
-All mine?
-Yeah.

392
00:20:58.353 --> 00:21:00.213
-That's great. No problem.
-Yeah. great news. right?

393
00:21:00.313 --> 00:21:02.313
-I bet you've been missing her.
-Oh…

394
00:21:03.033 --> 00:21:05.033
I really love flowers.

395
00:21:05.392 --> 00:21:06.532
Oh! That's good.

396
00:21:06.632 --> 00:21:08.852
It's just… ah. it doesn't matter.

398
00:21:10.792 --> 00:21:12.972
'Cause… these are for you.

399
00:21:13.072 --> 00:21:14.852
-What? For--
-For you.

[bee keeps buzzing]

401
00:21:16.311 --> 00:21:18.131
Get out!

402
00:21:18.231 --> 00:21:19.331
Wow!

404
00:21:21.431 --> 00:21:22.651
Oh. Uh-oh.

405

-What?
-It got me.

406

What? You… oh!

407
00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:28.450
Oh. you're… oh.

408
00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:31.290
-Allergy.
-Okay. You gotta be kidding me.

409
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:34.230
-Okay. Are you… uh-huh.
-I can't breathe!

410
00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:36.909
All right. I'm just gonna… okay.

411
00:21:38.349 --> 00:21:41.209
-Tess! Hurry.
-What? Oh my God. What happened? V?

412
00:21:41.309 --> 00:21:44.209
She's going into anaphylactic shock.
Do either of you have an EpiPen?

413
00:21:44.309 --> 00:21:46.728
-The Shih Tzus ate it last week.
-Okay!

414
00:21:46.828 --> 00:21:48.328
Uh. give me some water.

415
00:21:48.427 --> 00:21:49.927
-Okay.
-Okay. water.

[choking]

417
00:21:51.028 --> 00:21:52.808
Iris. activate EpiPen.

418
00:21:52.908 --> 00:21:55.228
[Iris] EpiPen activated.

-[gasps]
-There we go. you're back!

420
00:21:58.307 --> 00:21:59.727
There you go.

421
00:21:59.827 --> 00:22:01.827
And… hello?

422
00:22:02.707 --> 00:22:04.707
What's going on? And you're… gone.

423
00:22:05.427 --> 00:22:06.566
Uh…

424
00:22:06.666 --> 00:22:08.126
I got the water.

425
00:22:08.226 --> 00:22:10.526
Oh. my fucking God.
Is she gonna fucking die?

426
00:22:10.626 --> 00:22:11.526
Okay. that's not good.

427
00:22:11.626 --> 00:22:12.806
Oh my God. is she dead?

428
00:22:12.906 --> 00:22:15.805
Out of curiosity. she doesn't have
a heart condition. by any chance?

429
00:22:15.905 --> 00:22:17.725
Yeah. if her heart rate goes
too high. her heart can stop.

430
00:22:17.825 --> 00:22:19.825
which is why we use a special EpiPen.

431
00:22:20.385 --> 00:22:22.685
Okay. Uh… I…

432
00:22:22.785 --> 00:22:23.925
Do me a favor.

433
00:22:24.025 --> 00:22:26.644
Get me some blankets. some sugar.
some salt. ah. some water?

434

-Call an ambulance as well. okay?
-Okay. sure.

There you go. You're okay.

444

We're okay. It's okay.

Okay. I've got everything.
but I couldn't find any sugar.

-Yeah. Ten minutes.

Okay.

450
00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:14.180
Me? Oh. no one. I sell candles.

451
00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:17.019
Candles?

-Hi.
-Brad! You're still here.

455
00:23:39.057 --> 00:23:41.177
Yeah. you know. I…

456
00:23:44.417 --> 00:23:47.936
I figured it was the least I could do.
considering what happened.

457
00:23:48.496 --> 00:23:50.396
Oh. and…

458
00:23:50.496 --> 00:23:51.636
I got you these.

459
00:23:51.736 --> 00:23:53.516
Don't worry. they're fake.

460
00:23:53.616 --> 00:23:54.916
And I sprayed them as well.

461
00:23:55.016 --> 00:23:56.355
With all-natural ingredients.

462
00:23:56.455 --> 00:23:58.915
I figured that you probably
wouldn't want to kill anything.

463
00:23:59.015 --> 00:24:01.015
even if it was the thing
that tried to kill you.

464
00:24:01.695 --> 00:24:04.475
-I'll just put them…
-Yeah. Yeah. thank you.

-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:24:06.614 --> 00:24:08.394
Look. I was wondering…

467
00:24:08.494 --> 00:24:11.434
Well. not wondering.
I wanted to ask you something.

468
00:24:11.534 --> 00:24:13.594

Oh. actually! Don't drink that.

It's. you know. it's old.

474
00:24:31.172 --> 00:24:33.932

I can get you another one.

it's a little bit draughty in here.

be one explanation.

00:27:36.074 --> 00:27:37.493
I just…

526
00:27:37.593 --> 00:27:39.573
I wanted to clear something up.

527
00:27:39.673 --> 00:27:42.552
And just be honest
and transparent with you.

528
00:27:44.833 --> 00:27:50.332
I know it seems as though I was the one
responsible for nearly killing you.

529
00:27:50.432 --> 00:27:52.372
Actually killing me.

530
00:27:52.472 --> 00:27:54.572
Okay. Fair enough.

531
00:27:54.672 --> 00:27:56.212
But really. I mean.

532
00:27:56.312 --> 00:27:58.051
it was the bee that did it.

533
00:27:58.151 --> 00:28:01.251
Un-bee-lievable.

534
00:28:01.351 --> 00:28:02.771
I know. right?

535
00:28:02.871 --> 00:28:05.591
And he should've been here
to explain this to you.

536
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:09.570
But he's dead.

537
00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:13.410
It may have been the bee
who mis-bee-haved.

538
00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:15.810
But you're an accomplice. so…

539
00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:17.909
No. fair enough. Okay. yeah.

540
00:28:19.109 --> 00:28:23.089
I'll tell you what. Why don't we just
leave this bee stuff behind us.

541
00:28:23.189 --> 00:28:25.929
and just focus on new bee-ginnings?

542
00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:28.028
[phone vibrates. beeps]

543
00:28:28.788 --> 00:28:30.168
What do you think?

544
00:28:30.268 --> 00:28:31.728
-Whoa!
-What's wrong?

545
00:28:31.828 --> 00:28:34.568
-Gee. like. I guess it's just…
-What is?

546
00:28:34.668 --> 00:28:37.247
…really quite bee-wildering to me

547
00:28:37.347 --> 00:28:40.047
how long it's taking you
to ask me out on a date.

548
00:28:40.147 --> 00:28:41.607
So I'm gonna do it for you.

549
00:28:41.707 --> 00:28:44.967
I like pumpkin soup.
Do you like pumpkin soup?

550
00:28:45.067 --> 00:28:46.087
I do.

551
00:28:46.187 --> 00:28:48.206
Would you like to have
pumpkin soup with me?

552
00:28:48.306 --> 00:28:50.246
-[alarm goes off. commotion outside]
-Yes.

553
00:28:50.346 --> 00:28:51.526
Do you accept this mission?

554
00:28:51.626 --> 00:28:53.626
-I do.
-[commotion getting louder]

555
00:28:54.386 --> 00:28:56.046
What is going on out there?

556
00:28:56.146 --> 00:28:58.005
You know. It's a hospital.

557
00:28:58.105 --> 00:28:59.565
Sounds like someone's having twins.

-[softly] Fucking Russians.

562
00:29:14.864 --> 00:29:16.864
Hey. I can't get the focus working.
Can you help me?

563
00:29:17.543 --> 00:29:19.003
[Uri] Oh. very nice bike.

564
00:29:19.103 --> 00:29:21.203
[Orgi] Very slick. I like it.

565
00:29:21.303 --> 00:29:22.723
Gentlemen.

566
00:29:22.823 --> 00:29:24.683
We here to take missiles back.

567
00:29:24.783 --> 00:29:27.922
On the contrary. I'm here
to give you your missiles back.

568
00:29:28.022 --> 00:29:29.242
How much?

569
00:29:29.342 --> 00:29:30.642
How much for what?

570
00:29:30.742 --> 00:29:31.802
Missile.

571
00:29:31.902 --> 00:29:33.082
Nothing.

572
00:29:33.182 --> 00:29:35.442
Oh. I like it. You are hard negotiator.

573
00:29:35.542 --> 00:29:37.601
[Orgi] Very… very sexy.

574
00:29:37.701 --> 00:29:39.641
I like it. How much?

575
00:29:39.741 --> 00:29:42.401
As it seems you have not been informed:

576
00:29:42.501 --> 00:29:44.441
I'm giving you back your missiles.

577
00:29:44.541 --> 00:29:47.241
and you will use your fleet
of MiG fighter jets

578
00:29:47.341 --> 00:29:49.240
to take down some targets of my choosing.

579
00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:50.480
Interesting. interesting.

580
00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.240
So. like personal vendetta…

581
00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:55.160
Like a revenge motive?
You know. like a real spy film.

582
00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:57.319
[both continue discussing indistinctly]

583
00:29:57.419 --> 00:29:59.439
Can't we just give you money
and then take missiles?

584
00:29:59.539 --> 00:30:02.319
-It's much easier.
-No. You can't.

585
00:30:02.419 --> 00:30:03.599
Your boss agreed.

586
00:30:03.699 --> 00:30:07.099
Boss? Boss never said that.
Where are these missile thingies. hmm?

587
00:30:08.458 --> 00:30:10.458
-There.
-Where?

588
00:30:11.658 --> 00:30:12.638
In the water.

00:30:16.178 --> 00:30:17.278
It's not part of deal!

592
00:30:17.378 --> 00:30:18.797
-For fuck's…
-[Uri] The Boss is not happy.

593
00:30:18.897 --> 00:30:21.137
-[grunts angrily]
-[Uri] Super. duper unhappy!

594
00:30:22.177 --> 00:30:26.137
No! I didn't sink it. It's a submarine.

595
00:30:27.576 --> 00:30:29.396
-[Uri] Oh.
-It's your submarine.

596
00:30:29.496 --> 00:30:31.756
-Could be submarine.
-Could be submarine.

597
00:30:31.856 --> 00:30:33.856
Here.

00:30:34.496 --> 00:30:36.316
[talking indistinctly on phone]

599
00:30:36.416 --> 00:30:38.415
[scoffs] Again?

600
00:30:38.855 --> 00:30:40.435
Will you seriously sit down. please?

601
00:30:40.535 --> 00:30:41.795
…will make you more sensitive…

602
00:30:41.895 --> 00:30:45.315
I think it's the right size.

603
00:30:45.415 --> 00:30:47.754
-[both] Yeah!
-[laughter]

604
00:30:47.854 --> 00:30:49.114
Oh my God.

605
00:30:49.214 --> 00:30:50.234
How we get there?

606
00:30:50.334 --> 00:30:52.354
-You swim.
-Swim?

607
00:30:52.454 --> 00:30:54.454
-We could swim. Yeah.
-Could swim. Yeah.

608
00:30:55.254 --> 00:30:57.254
Who is this personal vendetta with?

609
00:30:58.373 --> 00:30:59.993
Fucking Brad.

610
00:31:00.093 --> 00:31:02.353
Brad? The Brad?

611
00:31:02.453 --> 00:31:03.393
Who's "Brad"?

612
00:31:03.493 --> 00:31:06.613
Like a spy legend.
Brad is like a spy legend.

613
00:31:08.812 --> 00:31:11.032
I'll send you the activation codes
when they're in the air.

614
00:31:11.132 --> 00:31:15.312
He never dies! He's like a hero
in this spy action film.

615
00:31:15.412 --> 00:31:17.791
-We're not in spy action film.
-All the bullets aimed at him…

616

[Orgi imitates machine gun fire]
Nothing gets him! Nothing gets him!

617
00:31:22.251 --> 00:31:23.951
Who are you?

618
00:31:24.051 --> 00:31:25.351
[woman on phone] In the head.

619
00:31:25.451 --> 00:31:27.810

[orchestral music playing]

621
00:31:38.129 --> 00:31:41.469
[man] What is going on there. Suzan?
Don't sound fucking good to me.

622
00:31:41.569 --> 00:31:42.549
Tell him. Jennifer.

623
00:31:42.649 --> 00:31:44.749
These missiles are unstoppable. sir.

624
00:31:44.849 --> 00:31:47.788
The only thing unstoppable
is my wife's spending habits.

625
00:31:47.888 --> 00:31:50.068
These missiles are phenomenally accurate.

626
00:31:50.168 --> 00:31:54.108
and can yield an impact equal to ten tons
of high explosives without a warhead.

627
00:31:54.208 --> 00:31:58.347
They are also capable of reaching almost
any city on the planet within 30 minutes.

628
00:31:58.447 --> 00:31:59.667
Well. where's fuckin' Brad?

629
00:31:59.767 --> 00:32:00.867
Ain't he taking care of this shit?

630
00:32:00.967 --> 00:32:02.987
I can't be doing
every fucking thing around here.

631
00:32:03.087 --> 00:32:04.347
He'll be back online soon.

632
00:32:04.447 --> 00:32:06.067
As soon as he refocuses.

633
00:32:06.167 --> 00:32:07.747
and starts thinking
with that other head of his.

634
00:32:07.847 --> 00:32:10.266
You just listen to me. Suzan.
You fucking listen to me right now.

635
00:32:10.366 --> 00:32:14.206
You get those fucking bad balls back.
and you get Brad back. Goddammit!

636
00:32:17.766 --> 00:32:19.425
Well. go on. sort it out. Jennifer!

637
00:32:19.525 --> 00:32:21.785
I want Brad back in this room
within the hour.

638
00:32:21.885 --> 00:32:24.965
And take Paradise with you
in case this try-hard shows up.

639
00:32:27.805 --> 00:32:29.104
There is something else.

640
00:32:29.204 --> 00:32:31.024
Oh. God. Of course there is.
What is it? Spit it out.

641
00:32:31.124 --> 00:32:32.984
It's Walker. He's still alive.

642
00:32:33.084 --> 00:32:35.084
Oh. for…

643
00:32:36.124 --> 00:32:38.123
Well. take Natasha as well. then.

644
00:32:38.443 --> 00:32:41.623
Are you sure that's a good idea?
I mean. given their… you know.

645
00:32:41.723 --> 00:32:44.943
Well. clearly bullets
don't seem to be working. do they?

646
00:32:45.043 --> 00:32:47.863
Just don't tell her that he's around
unless it's absolutely necessary.

647
00:32:47.963 --> 00:32:50.222
It could very quickly lead
to a clusterfuck!

648
00:32:50.322 --> 00:32:52.322
Yes. Suzan.

Thank you.

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.580
This place is beautiful.

653
00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.680
Yeah. it's nice. It's relaxing.

654
00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.740
You know. I actually saved
the owner's life once.

655
00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.539
so he kind of owes me big-time.

656
00:33:19.639 --> 00:33:22.899
Really? You do that a lot. save lives?

657
00:33:22.999 --> 00:33:24.659
Well. only…

658
00:33:24.759 --> 00:33:26.539
only the people that matter.

659
00:33:26.639 --> 00:33:28.638
Well. and a few others.

660
00:33:30.438 --> 00:33:33.098
You know what. I'm just gonna
get this out in the open.

661
00:33:33.198 --> 00:33:35.578
You know. we don't have to talk about it.

662
00:33:35.677 --> 00:33:37.677
No. I want to.

663
00:33:39.797 --> 00:33:42.017
It's a really rare heart condition.

664
00:33:42.117 --> 00:33:47.377
It makes me highly susceptible
to ventricular fibrillation.

665
00:33:47.477 --> 00:33:49.476
or sudden cardiac arrest.

666
00:33:50.196 --> 00:33:53.216
If my heart rate rises quickly. then

667
00:33:53.316 --> 00:33:57.876
the electrical system in my heart
becomes irregular. and I pass out.

668
00:34:01.715 --> 00:34:04.275
If that happens. I have two minutes…

669
00:34:04.955 --> 00:34:07.135
and. well. you saw the rest.

670
00:34:07.235 --> 00:34:09.234
It's no blood going to the brain…

671
00:34:14.114 --> 00:34:16.573
You know. the worst thing is.
I can't drink coffee.

672
00:34:16.674 --> 00:34:18.772
Well. you know what they say about coffee.

673
00:34:18.872 --> 00:34:21.933
Just makes people do stupid things faster.

674
00:34:22.033 --> 00:34:25.533
You're really not worried
that I could die at any moment?

675
00:34:25.633 --> 00:34:27.212
No.

676
00:34:27.312 --> 00:34:30.172
I mean. it's just a part of life.

677
00:34:30.272 --> 00:34:32.412
Gotta live.

678
00:34:32.511 --> 00:34:36.652
Besides. I'm actually more worried
about the calamari they serve here.

Yeah. yeah. vanilla spice. it's a hit.

682
00:34:46.951 --> 00:34:48.290

[orchestra comes in]

686
00:35:05.388 --> 00:35:07.888
No. No. I'd rather pull my teeth out

687
00:35:07.989 --> 00:35:10.008
or jump out a plane without a parachute

688
00:35:10.107 --> 00:35:12.107
than take that call.

689
00:35:12.627 --> 00:35:13.647
Okay.

690
00:35:13.747 --> 00:35:17.968
So I would have thought that
being a vet would be stressful.

691
00:35:18.067 --> 00:35:22.607
Weirdly enough. it's like.
around animals. I'm really calm.

692
00:35:22.707 --> 00:35:25.667
Even in extreme circumstances.
there's just

693
00:35:26.267 --> 00:35:28.426
something about them that makes me feel…

694
00:35:30.586 --> 00:35:32.006
settled.

695
00:35:32.105 --> 00:35:35.145
Anyway. that is enough about me.
I wanna know about you.

696
00:35:35.665 --> 00:35:37.526
Me? Oh. uh…

697
00:35:37.625 --> 00:35:40.365

What. again?

701
00:35:45.585 --> 00:35:47.924
You know. I have some medication
for bladder control

702

-That's very funny.

705
00:35:53.343 --> 00:35:56.283
You know. I will try it.
I'll try anything once.

706
00:35:56.384 --> 00:35:57.843
I'll be right back.

707
00:35:57.944 --> 00:35:59.942

You know. I would really appreciate it

710
00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:34.560
if we could just
pick this up another time.

711
00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:36.600
You know. it's just I'm just right
in the middle of something

712
00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:38.700
that's a very special moment.

713
00:36:39.379 --> 00:36:42.019
-Trident says hello.
-Trident.

714
00:36:42.578 --> 00:36:44.979
Where do they come up with these names?
I mean. honestly.

715
00:36:45.819 --> 00:36:52.317
They still calling you "the Apprentice"?
As in. learning to assassinate?

716
00:36:52.417 --> 00:36:55.997
Okay. well. yeah.
But it's a whole system. okay?

717
00:36:56.098 --> 00:37:01.596
You know. it's a pyramid of apprentice.
apprenti. apprentees.

718
00:37:01.696 --> 00:37:05.156
And like. it's better to be
the apprentice just under Trident.

719
00:37:05.256 --> 00:37:08.116
than to be the boss
at the bottom of the pyramid.

720
00:37:08.216 --> 00:37:09.995
She's there. and I'm just below her…

721
00:37:10.096 --> 00:37:11.716
So Trident is a she.

722
00:37:11.816 --> 00:37:13.915
-I didn't say that.
-Yeah. you kinda did.

723
00:37:14.015 --> 00:37:16.756
-I didn't…
-I know that Trident's a woman.

724
00:37:16.855 --> 00:37:22.115
You don't know anything. okay. It's like.
he. she. she's he. her's him. you know?

725
00:37:22.214 --> 00:37:23.875
You heard what I wanted you to hear.

726

-Fine. He. she. they. whatever. okay?
-Let's go with they.

727

-Okay. they.
-Okay.

728
00:37:29.134 --> 00:37:34.254
Is this Trident…
is she really worth dying for?

729
00:37:37.254 --> 00:37:39.254
For you. maybe.

730
00:37:39.812 --> 00:37:41.553
No. you mean for you.

731
00:37:41.653 --> 00:37:44.673
No. I mean for you. she is-- he is. They.

732
00:37:44.772 --> 00:37:48.993
Okay. she. But if I die.
it wouldn't be for that reason.

733
00:37:49.093 --> 00:37:50.591
But you would die. though.

734
00:37:50.692 --> 00:37:54.152
No. I get that. But what I'm saying is.
that wouldn't be the same thing

735
00:37:54.252 --> 00:37:56.752
because I'm asking you.
are you willing to die for her?

736
00:37:56.852 --> 00:37:59.471
Which implies I would be asking myself.

737

Besides. You saved my life once.

Do you think you can do it again?

Oh yeah. I'm highly skilled
in the area of saving lives. so I feel--

Yeah. if that's something inside of you.

then it's probably best that.
you know. you get it out.

772

Otherwise. you're not being honest
with yourself. Or me.

00:56:56.897 --> 00:56:58.877
If you urgently need me. again.

1051
00:56:58.977 --> 00:57:00.957
then try me again when I'm clearly
not busy with something else

1052
00:57:01.058 --> 00:57:03.078
that is equally if not more important.

1053
00:57:03.178 --> 00:57:04.716
If you would like to just talk.

1054
00:57:04.817 --> 00:57:06.477
then I'll call you back
when I'm in the right place.

1055
00:57:06.576 --> 00:57:08.576
Okay. bye.

1056
00:57:09.297 --> 00:57:11.297
[music continues]

1057
00:58:06.651 --> 00:58:08.651
[both grunting]

1058
00:58:12.131 --> 00:58:15.810
[both speaking Russian]

1059
00:58:18.410 --> 00:58:20.410
[grunting]

1060
00:58:27.408 --> 00:58:30.549
[both speaking Russian]

1061
00:58:30.649 --> 00:58:32.649
To our success.

1062
00:58:36.607 --> 00:58:38.607
[phone ringing]

1063
00:58:39.288 --> 00:58:41.288
Jet men!

1064
00:58:42.048 --> 00:58:42.948
Hello?

1065
00:58:53.287 --> 00:58:55.466
Dongle. Give me dongle.

1066
00:58:55.566 --> 00:58:59.406
-Show you my dongle? [muttering]
-Oh. I see. Authenticator.

1067
00:59:00.205 --> 00:59:02.205
[indistinct muttering]

1068
00:59:03.125 --> 00:59:05.125
Second.

1069
00:59:06.205 --> 00:59:08.105
Uh… one.

1070
00:59:08.205 --> 00:59:11.544
eight. nine. five. four. six.

1071
00:59:19.283 --> 00:59:22.584
The jet men. They want to
break up and fly alone. I think.

1072
00:59:22.683 --> 00:59:24.743
Typical jet men.

1073
00:59:30.522 --> 00:59:33.363
-Split yourselves up.

1074
00:59:37.241 --> 00:59:38.902
Whoa. whoa. whoa. Ten minutes?

1075
00:59:39.002 --> 00:59:41.622
That's too soon. Can we do thirty?

1076
00:59:41.721 --> 00:59:44.221
Still haven't told Boss yet.
Don't anybody--

1077
00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:54.040
-He called me "sir."
-Nice.

1078
00:59:54.441 --> 00:59:56.620
They want to launch in ten minutes.

1079
00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:57.859
But we not tell Boss yet.

1080
00:59:57.960 --> 00:59:59.960
He want to watch from satellite.

1081
01:00:00.359 --> 01:00:02.379
Satellite too slow.

1082
01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:04.480
They'll never make it.

1083
01:00:05.279 --> 01:00:08.138
Fuck it. Let's do it.
Let's blow these loads.

1084
01:00:08.239 --> 01:00:10.459
-Let's blow this shit.
-Let's do it. let's blow it!

1085
01:00:10.558 --> 01:00:11.618
Let's blow it.

1086
01:00:11.718 --> 01:00:13.538
Yeah. launch missiles in ten.

1087
01:00:17.877 --> 01:00:20.298
-Fuck the Boss.
-Fuck the Boss.

1088
01:00:20.397 --> 01:00:22.477
[at once] Fuck the Boss!

1089
01:00:40.316 --> 01:00:42.475
[orchestral music playing]

1090
01:00:49.075 --> 01:00:50.254
[static buzzing]

1091
01:00:50.355 --> 01:00:53.355
-Please identify yourself.
-It's Brad. James. C'mon.

1092
01:00:53.875 --> 01:00:55.013
James. open the door. C'mon.

1093
01:00:55.114 --> 01:00:57.334
Brad who? I know like seven Brads. okay?

1094
01:00:57.433 --> 01:00:59.053
Open the fucking door. c'mon!

1095
01:00:59.154 --> 01:01:00.854
Please state last name. age.

1096
01:01:00.953 --> 01:01:03.013
social security number.
and last seven kills.

1097
01:01:03.114 --> 01:01:05.252
If you don't let me in right now.
I'm gonna tell Suzan

1098
01:01:05.352 --> 01:01:07.513
to take away your satellite
privileges. Again.

1099
01:01:15.951 --> 01:01:19.011
Seriously. James.
I don't have time for games.

1100
01:01:19.111 --> 01:01:21.732
I told you. I friggin' told you. Brad.
it's always the fucking Russians.

1101
01:01:21.832 --> 01:01:23.611
Even when it's not the Russians.
it's still the Russians.

1102
01:01:23.712 --> 01:01:26.290
-We need to find her. James.
-Did you say "we"?

1103
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:29.531
Because "we" implies that you'd actually
be doing something. but from memory.

1104
01:01:29.631 --> 01:01:31.290
you don't even have
a computer. Brad. okay?

1105
01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:33.410
And I'm always the one
stuck in this shithole of a room

1106
01:01:33.511 --> 01:01:34.611
doing everything myself!

1107
01:01:34.711 --> 01:01:40.189
Okay! Fine. James.
You. can you please find her! Please?

1108
01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:46.529
Fine! Already have. She's in an abandoned
steelworks building outside of town. Here.

1109
01:01:46.629 --> 01:01:49.269
That's impossible.
How'd you find her so quickly?

1110
01:01:50.269 --> 01:01:52.529
Okay. so it's the nanobot dust particles
that I've been working on.

1111
01:01:52.629 --> 01:01:53.808
Like. billions of them. actually.

1112
01:01:53.908 --> 01:01:56.368
They attach themselves to anyone
you come into contact with.

1113
01:01:56.468 --> 01:01:59.247
Nano what? What're you talking about?

1114
01:01:59.348 --> 01:02:00.328
Y'know. the smart dust?

1115
01:02:00.428 --> 01:02:04.607
I put some in your aftershave. toothpaste.
deodorant. anti-ageing moisture cream…

1116
01:02:04.707 --> 01:02:08.047
Okay. And who gave you the authority
to do that. James?

1117
01:02:08.147 --> 01:02:10.406
I was just thinking that…

1118
01:02:10.506 --> 01:02:12.767
Suzan said that I could…
Well. I just thought that…

1119
01:02:12.866 --> 01:02:13.966
Well. actually…

1120
01:02:14.067 --> 01:02:16.006
You just "thought that…" is it?

1121
01:02:16.105 --> 01:02:17.886
Look. we're getting off-topic over here.
so maybe we should

1122
01:02:17.986 --> 01:02:19.086
just focus on the mission at hand?

1123
01:02:19.185 --> 01:02:20.846
And so. Veronica's right here. see?

1124
01:02:20.946 --> 01:02:23.086
Complete invasion of privacy.

1125
01:02:23.185 --> 01:02:24.926
-Okay. so that's her there?
-Yes.

1126
01:02:25.026 --> 01:02:26.044
-You're sure?
-Yep.

1127
01:02:26.145 --> 01:02:28.785
Okay. All right. So. next thing. Well…

1128
01:02:29.424 --> 01:02:34.524
I need a gun that's. y'know.
it's kinda. like. nonlethal.

1129
01:02:34.625 --> 01:02:38.163
What?! I mean. Paradise said you were
losing your shit. but this. really?

1130
01:02:38.263 --> 01:02:40.323
"Nonlethal"? This is some
really weird behavior. Brad.

1131
01:02:40.424 --> 01:02:43.084
-I'm kinda worried about you. actually.
-Come on. James. Whaddya got?

1132
01:02:43.183 --> 01:02:45.923
Fine! Okay. yeah. sure. I'll give you
some "useless nonlethal bullets"

1133
01:02:46.022 --> 01:02:47.323
that. of course. don't even exist

1134
01:02:47.423 --> 01:02:48.723
because everyone knows that a projectile

1135
01:02:48.823 --> 01:02:51.323
traveling at that velocity or speed
will. of course. kill anyone.

1136
01:02:51.423 --> 01:02:55.022
But if you really want something. there's
a nonlethal gun in that box over there.

1137
01:02:57.462 --> 01:02:59.462
Unbelievable.

1138
01:03:00.261 --> 01:03:02.261
"Non-death gun. Only use if soft."

1139
01:03:02.982 --> 01:03:03.801
Really?

1140
01:03:03.902 --> 01:03:05.681
Hey. wha…? What?

1141
01:03:05.781 --> 01:03:08.480
What. what. that's…

1142
01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:10.241
That's it? That's all you got?

1143
01:03:10.341 --> 01:03:13.000
-What about this one? This one looks cool.
-What do you mean. is that all I got?

1144
01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:15.361
That's my genius. Know how long
that thing took me to make?!

1145
01:03:15.461 --> 01:03:17.460
Okay! Fine. how does it work?

1146
01:03:17.939 --> 01:03:19.939
Fuck's sake. Brad!

1147
01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:22.460
Just press this button over here… [sniffs]

1148
01:03:22.939 --> 01:03:27.038
What have I told you about that? Don't
do that. I told you that's weird. Okay.

1149
01:03:27.138 --> 01:03:28.479
Just press this button over here. okay?

1150
01:03:28.578 --> 01:03:31.038
So the gun will discharge
a small wave of targeted energy

1151
01:03:31.138 --> 01:03:32.959
that'll act like a taser.
knocking them out.

1152
01:03:33.058 --> 01:03:36.497
What. so this is exactly
what I just asked you for?

1153
01:03:37.618 --> 01:03:39.618
-James?
-Whatever.

1154
01:03:40.018 --> 01:03:41.837
-Okay. fine!
-Remember one thing. okay?

1155
01:03:41.937 --> 01:03:43.598
Do not turn the gun on full.

1156
01:03:43.698 --> 01:03:47.037
Okay. fine. What happens
if I do turn it on full?

1157
01:03:47.136 --> 01:03:48.557
I don't actually know.

1158
01:03:48.656 --> 01:03:51.156
Possibly some long-term.
probably permanent damage

1159
01:03:51.256 --> 01:03:54.716
to the body. eyes. ears. heart. anus.

1160
01:03:54.817 --> 01:03:56.556
Anus? What do you mean. anus?

1161
01:03:56.656 --> 01:03:58.556
I dunno. Brad. just trying
to cover my bases. okay?

1162
01:03:58.656 --> 01:04:00.875
Just listen to what I say.
Don't turn it on full.

1163
01:04:00.975 --> 01:04:06.555
Just to confirm: nonlethal gun. unlimited
bullets. just don't use it on full.

1164
01:04:06.654 --> 01:04:08.674
Once again. I showed it to Head Office.

1165
01:04:08.774 --> 01:04:11.395
and they just think it's a toy.
I mean. seriously. c'mon!

1166
01:04:11.495 --> 01:04:14.194
Look at me. Do I look like someone
who plays with toys to you?

1167
01:04:14.294 --> 01:04:15.794
-Well. I…
-I think not!

1168
01:04:15.894 --> 01:04:17.993
Whatever. Okay. tell me.

1169
01:04:18.093 --> 01:04:19.593
What am I walking into here?

1170
01:04:19.694 --> 01:04:22.073
You had one job. Jennifer. one job!

1171
01:04:22.174 --> 01:04:23.953
How could you fuck this up?

1172
01:04:24.053 --> 01:04:26.493
-[Natasha crying]
-Call yourself a trainee spy.

1173
01:04:27.212 --> 01:04:28.433
You're pathetic.

1174
01:04:28.533 --> 01:04:30.153
[chuckles]

1175
01:04:30.252 --> 01:04:32.033
How much do you bench-press?

1176
01:04:32.133 --> 01:04:34.133
-[phone vibrates]
-Shh.

1177
01:04:34.573 --> 01:04:39.412
-Jennifer.
-Suzan. I have a small update for you.

1178
01:04:40.571 --> 01:04:41.991
Trident took Brad's girl.

1179
01:04:42.091 --> 01:04:44.091
-[Natasha sobbing over phone]
-Paradise is missing.

1180
01:04:44.812 --> 01:04:49.191
The missiles are in the air.
and the Dog Walker is gone.

1181
01:04:49.290 --> 01:04:50.511
-Again.
-I'll fucking kill him!

1182
01:04:50.611 --> 01:04:52.071
Don't touch him. he's mine.

1183
01:04:52.171 --> 01:04:53.551
What happened with Brad?

1184
01:04:53.651 --> 01:04:55.191
He's gone after his girl.

1185
01:04:55.290 --> 01:04:59.149
Oh for God's sakes!
What about these hypersonic thingies?

1186
01:04:59.250 --> 01:05:02.509
What's he doing about those?
I can't be doing everything around here!

1187
01:05:02.609 --> 01:05:05.470
Find these Russian idiots.
and get that code!

1188
01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:06.388
I'm on it.

1189
01:05:06.489 --> 01:05:08.388
You know what?
I'm just gonna call Brad right now.

1190
01:05:08.489 --> 01:05:10.489
Shut the fuck up. Natasha!

1191
01:05:11.129 --> 01:05:13.308
You're not the only one
with problems. you know!

1192
01:05:13.408 --> 01:05:16.247
I'm sorry. That was harsh. Love is hard.

1193
01:05:17.127 --> 01:05:19.308
[Natasha keeps sobbing]

1194
01:05:19.408 --> 01:05:22.508
-[funk music playing]
-[police sirens wailing]

1195
01:05:22.607 --> 01:05:25.908
[man] Squad. move out.
No sudden movements. Keep quiet.

1196
01:05:26.008 --> 01:05:27.466
Davis. is that a knife?

1197
01:05:27.567 --> 01:05:30.027
-Where's your gun?!
-I don't need it.

1198
01:05:30.127 --> 01:05:33.667
Shit. Shut the fuck up.
Right. move. move. move!

1199
01:05:33.767 --> 01:05:35.767
Everybody. stay in formation.

1200
01:05:38.846 --> 01:05:40.846
[henchman] Here he is! Over here!

1201
01:05:41.966 --> 01:05:43.866
James. I'm walking into the compound.

1202
01:05:43.966 --> 01:05:46.064
You got eyes on me? I need to know
what I'm walking into here.

1203
01:05:46.165 --> 01:05:47.865
Copy. I've deployed the triplets.

1204
01:05:47.964 --> 01:05:49.424
Approaching location.

1205
01:05:49.524 --> 01:05:51.705
[drones whirring]

1206
01:05:51.805 --> 01:05:53.904
[man 1] This place is filthy!

1207
01:05:54.004 --> 01:05:56.004
-[man 2] Have you had your tetanus shot?
-[man 3] I haven't.

1208
01:05:58.524 --> 01:06:00.464
Hey. guys. wait up!

1209
01:06:00.564 --> 01:06:03.203
-Brad. Suzan wants to talk to you.
-Well. I really don't wanna talk to her.

1210
01:06:04.604 --> 01:06:05.544
Patching you through now.

1211
01:06:05.644 --> 01:06:07.643
Bradly. where are you?

1212
01:06:09.482 --> 01:06:11.542
Lots of windy noise.

1213
01:06:11.643 --> 01:06:14.763
Just wondering what your plan is
about these hypersonic missiles.

1214
01:06:17.122 --> 01:06:20.102
C'mon. everybody knows how much
I make this shit up as I go!

1215
01:06:20.201 --> 01:06:23.341
You know what. I'm pretty pissed
that nobody's asking me

1216
01:06:23.442 --> 01:06:25.462
about how my girlfriend's doing right now.

1217
01:06:25.562 --> 01:06:26.500
I mean. seriously.

1218
01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:30.781
It's just these missiles are in
the sky right now. Bradley.

1219
01:06:30.881 --> 01:06:32.881
So things are a little tight.

1220
01:06:40.439 --> 01:06:42.460
Any idea who's behind this?

1221
01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:45.020
Well. Suzan. my guess-- whoa!

1222
01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:46.979
Jesus!

1223
01:06:47.078 --> 01:06:48.138
[grunts]

1224
01:06:48.239 --> 01:06:50.859
…from the intel which I gathered myself

1225
01:06:50.959 --> 01:06:52.698
is that there are
seven hypersonic missiles

1226
01:06:52.799 --> 01:06:54.939
heading for agency locations
around the world.

1227
01:06:55.038 --> 01:06:58.417
So. Trident is an ex-spy
who's seeking revenge

1228
01:06:58.518 --> 01:07:00.538
for some past wrongdoing by me.

1229
01:07:00.638 --> 01:07:02.258
Which. of course.
I have no recollection of.

1230
01:07:02.357 --> 01:07:04.178
and can't recall such an event.

1231
01:07:04.278 --> 01:07:08.417
But really. this is just
some elaborate plan of hers to distract me

1232
01:07:08.517 --> 01:07:10.057
so I don't foil the Russian plot

1233
01:07:10.156 --> 01:07:12.017
to take down the agency

1234
01:07:12.116 --> 01:07:14.817
with seven hypersonic missiles.

1235
01:07:14.917 --> 01:07:17.935
Now if you don't mind. Suzan.
I've really gotta go. okay?

1236
01:07:18.035 --> 01:07:20.035
I'm right in the middle of something here.

1237
01:07:22.196 --> 01:07:24.196
Here we go.

1238
01:07:26.035 --> 01:07:28.555
[hard rock music playing]

1239
01:08:05.551 --> 01:08:07.410
[James] So. I'm picking up
a lot of heat signatures.

1240
01:08:07.511 --> 01:08:09.330
I suggest using super caution.

1241
01:08:09.431 --> 01:08:11.431
Yeah. let's do that. shall we?

1243

Crystal offline.

1247
01:08:38.907 --> 01:08:39.968
[Brad] What happened?

1248
01:08:40.068 --> 01:08:44.128
They shot my babies. They shot my babies!
Oh my God. Oh my God!

1249
01:08:44.228 --> 01:08:45.808
I can't believe they just did that!

1250
01:08:45.907 --> 01:08:48.067
[overlapping shouting. grunting]

1251
01:08:48.787 --> 01:08:51.947
Just… I need a minute. I need…

1252
01:08:52.947 --> 01:08:56.047
[Brad] James! I'm gonna buy you
some new ones.

1253
01:08:56.147 --> 01:08:58.686
No! See that's what it is
with all you spies!

1254
01:08:58.786 --> 01:09:00.526
We're all replaceable.
Well. I'm not. okay?

1255
01:09:00.626 --> 01:09:02.626
And neither are my drones!

1256
01:09:04.786 --> 01:09:07.285
Well. I mean. technically
my drones are. but I'm not!

1257
01:09:07.385 --> 01:09:10.825
Seriously. these drones
are becoming a real issue. Just relax!

1258
01:09:19.384 --> 01:09:21.483
James? It would really help
to know what room she's in!

1259
01:09:21.584 --> 01:09:24.044
-I'm working on it. Brad!

[man speaking inaudibly]

1262
01:10:11.299 --> 01:10:13.438
Okay. I'm scanning the perimeter now.
Got the missiles too.

1263
01:10:13.539 --> 01:10:16.159
The hypersonics are aiming at the
seven agency buildings around the world.

1264
01:10:16.259 --> 01:10:17.638
See? I mean. I called that.

1265
01:10:17.737 --> 01:10:19.918
-I so fucking called that!
-Whatever. Brad.

1266
01:10:20.018 --> 01:10:23.117
-Well. which one is it. James?! Seriously.

Walker?

1269
01:10:31.977 --> 01:10:33.197
Now is good time.

1270
01:10:33.297 --> 01:10:37.157
No. now is a really terrible time.
How the hell did you find me?

1271
01:10:37.257 --> 01:10:40.356
I hack into nanobot from your hair.
and trace signal.

1272

You hacked through six layers
of encryption that James…

1273

You know what? It doesn't matter.

1274

I don't have time for this.

[grunting]

1276
01:10:57.255 --> 01:10:59.254
Are you trying to hurt me?

1277

I'm confused!

I crush your penis with my bare hand!

Okay. that is a super weird
thing to say. but--

1284
01:11:16.213 --> 01:11:19.032
Oh. c'mon. c'mon. okay. I'm pretty sure

1285
01:11:19.132 --> 01:11:23.052
that Natasha would want us
to talk about this.

1286
01:11:25.852 --> 01:11:27.352
Stop touching tip!

1287
01:11:27.452 --> 01:11:29.451
Okay. fine. Before you kill me.

1288

to give you something.

01:16:20.541 --> 01:16:22.602
What is it that you want?

1384
01:16:22.702 --> 01:16:24.702
Just having a little fun.

1385
01:16:25.461 --> 01:16:27.822
The bomb vest on the girl
is connected to her heart.

1386
01:16:29.101 --> 01:16:30.961
If she dies. the vest will deactivate.

1387
01:16:31.061 --> 01:16:34.601
If you move your arms
or get up from the chair.

1388
01:16:34.701 --> 01:16:36.701
kaboom.

1389
01:16:37.101 --> 01:16:39.740
James. where the hell are you?!
C'mon. we're running outta time here.

1390
01:16:42.179 --> 01:16:44.260
[moaning]

1391
01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:48.000
[whimpers]

1392
01:16:48.099 --> 01:16:49.199
Time to die.

1393
01:16:49.299 --> 01:16:51.299
Can we talk?
Can we please just talk? Please?

1394
01:16:51.979 --> 01:16:52.999
[gun clicks]

1395
01:16:53.099 --> 01:16:54.519
Can we talk? Please. can we just talk?

1396
01:16:54.619 --> 01:16:56.079
Can we just talk? Please?

1397
01:16:56.179 --> 01:16:57.839
No. I don't wanna die. please!

1398
01:16:57.938 --> 01:16:59.938
Wait. One last request?

1399
01:17:00.418 --> 01:17:02.918
The headphones.
Can you please just put them on?

1400
01:17:03.018 --> 01:17:05.018
I don't wanna hear the sound of
the bullet before it kills me.

1401
01:17:07.058 --> 01:17:08.518
No. that's wrong.

1402
01:17:08.617 --> 01:17:11.817
The saying goes that you don't hear
the sound of the bullet that kills you.

1403
01:17:12.376 --> 01:17:14.517
Ah. no. I don't think that's right.

1404
01:17:14.617 --> 01:17:16.637
-It's right.
-Ah. no. it's not.

1405
01:17:16.737 --> 01:17:17.916
Well. I think it's right.

1406
01:17:18.017 --> 01:17:19.236
No. it's definitely not right.

1407
01:17:19.336 --> 01:17:21.336
It is. most definitely. right.

1408
01:17:21.816 --> 01:17:24.456
James. where the hell are you?!
C'mon. we're running outta time here.

1409
01:17:25.016 --> 01:17:27.016
Veronica. wake up. please!

1410
01:17:28.736 --> 01:17:30.715
Veronica. I've got this. okay?

1411
01:17:30.815 --> 01:17:33.075
-Brad?
-Hey. it's me. It's Brad.

1412
01:17:33.175 --> 01:17:37.995
Need you to look at me. stay calm. and pay
no attention to what's strapped to you.

1413
01:17:38.095 --> 01:17:39.874
-Brad. what is it?
-It's nothing.

1414
01:17:39.974 --> 01:17:42.193
-Well. I think it's a bomb.
-Yeah. okay. it is a bomb.

1415
01:17:42.294 --> 01:17:44.994
Veronica. I need you to stay calm!
Just breathe.

1416
01:17:45.094 --> 01:17:46.313
-Stay calm. okay?
-Get it off.

1417
01:17:46.414 --> 01:17:48.273
-Get it off.
-Nothing is gonna happen to you.

1418
01:17:48.374 --> 01:17:51.153
I promise. okay? I'm gonna get us
outta this. all right?

1419
01:17:51.253 --> 01:17:53.253
What is that clock counting down to?

1420
01:17:54.013 --> 01:17:55.233
That one?

1421
01:17:55.333 --> 01:17:57.593
It's best not to pay attention
to clocks in these situations.

1422
01:17:57.693 --> 01:17:58.673
These situations?

1423
01:17:58.773 --> 01:18:00.772
Brutal truth?

1424
01:18:01.132 --> 01:18:04.312
I don't sell candles. and. in fact.
I don't even like candles much.

1425
01:18:04.412 --> 01:18:05.952
They just start too many
house fires. y'know?

1426
01:18:06.052 --> 01:18:07.512
-Brad.
-Yeah. I'm sorry. Okay.

1427
01:18:07.612 --> 01:18:10.611
Brutal truth. there's some things
I need to tell you.

1428
01:18:11.211 --> 01:18:12.311
I'm a spy.

1429
01:18:12.411 --> 01:18:14.191
And this here is just a. you know.

1430
01:18:14.291 --> 01:18:17.031
stock-standard spy puzzle
that I need to solve.

1431
01:18:17.130 --> 01:18:19.031
-What?
-A spy puzzle.

1432
01:18:19.130 --> 01:18:22.429
Y'know? Like right now it's a lose-lose.
I need to turn it into a win-lose.

1433
01:18:22.530 --> 01:18:23.630
The hard part's getting to a win-win.

1434
01:18:23.730 --> 01:18:25.309
But I'm actually pretty good
at this stuff.

1435
01:18:25.410 --> 01:18:28.110
-[hyperventilating] I can't breathe!
-No. just breathe!

1436
01:18:28.210 --> 01:18:29.829
James!

1437
01:18:29.929 --> 01:18:31.749
I have the gun.
I say it's right. so it's right.

1438
01:18:31.849 --> 01:18:32.669
No. it's not.

1439
01:18:32.769 --> 01:18:34.709
because even with a headshot. you can
still hear the sound of the--

1440
01:18:34.809 --> 01:18:38.028
-It's not important. doesn't matter.
-Fine. I'll use my sword. then.

1441
01:18:38.129 --> 01:18:39.428
No. no. no. no. no!

1442
01:18:39.528 --> 01:18:41.188
The gun's good. Gun's good.
Just. headphones. please?

1443
01:18:41.288 --> 01:18:43.288
Please? Headphones.

1444
01:18:45.008 --> 01:18:47.008
All right. Be gentle.

1445
01:18:48.968 --> 01:18:51.407
You can just see the bullet.

1446
01:18:52.687 --> 01:18:54.687
No. no. What does that mean?

1447
01:18:57.567 --> 01:18:59.566
Here comes the boom.

1448
01:19:03.246 --> 01:19:06.366
My God. it's working.
Oh my God. it's working!

1449
01:19:06.965 --> 01:19:08.385
It's working. everybody!

1450
01:19:08.486 --> 01:19:11.465
Oh my God. did you see that?
Oh. wait. there's nobody here.

1451
01:19:11.565 --> 01:19:13.184
Dammit. why is there nobody here?!

1452
01:19:13.285 --> 01:19:15.825
This is so great.
I can't believe it's working!

1453
01:19:15.925 --> 01:19:16.985
[wet pop]

1454
01:19:17.085 --> 01:19:20.443
Wait. man. whoa! Oh man! What's happening?

1455
01:19:21.604 --> 01:19:22.704
So sensitive!

1456
01:19:22.804 --> 01:19:24.804
Best day ever! Best day ever!

1457
01:19:25.483 --> 01:19:28.324
-[hard rock music playing]
-[indistinct. overlapping chatter]

1458
01:19:29.164 --> 01:19:31.163
[Natasha] Drink this.

1459
01:19:36.163 --> 01:19:38.843
[indistinct. overlapping chatter]

1460
01:19:48.842 --> 01:19:50.840
[both talking. slurred]

1461
01:19:55.241 --> 01:19:57.021
All right. Find it. some kind of dongle.

1462
01:19:57.121 --> 01:19:58.461
I not touch his dongle.

1463
01:19:58.561 --> 01:20:00.580
No. like one of those
bank thingies. you know?

1464
01:20:00.679 --> 01:20:02.660
Check the pockets. quick!

1465
01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:04.760
-I think I found something.
-James!

1466
01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:07.740
Brad… [panting]

1467
01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:10.019
What the…?!

1468
01:20:10.119 --> 01:20:11.259
Iris. call James.

1469
01:20:11.358 --> 01:20:12.339
I'm scared.

1470
01:20:12.438 --> 01:20:13.979
Please. look at me. Stay calm. Veronica.

1471
01:20:14.079 --> 01:20:15.938
You're not gonna die. Nobody's gonna die.

1472
01:20:16.039 --> 01:20:22.318
Well. somebody's definitely gonna get it.
but… Veronica? Veronica!

1473
01:20:23.918 --> 01:20:26.577
Iris. I need you to start a timer.
One minute and thirty seconds from now.

1474
01:20:26.678 --> 01:20:27.657
I'm back. baby.

1475
01:20:27.758 --> 01:20:30.897
James. get me out of these
villain chairs now.

1476
01:20:30.996 --> 01:20:32.737
Hey. you have no idea
what just happened to me. okay?

1477
01:20:32.836 --> 01:20:35.217
And once again. you're not even asking
because it's always about you!

1478
01:20:35.317 --> 01:20:37.557
James. please. can you just help me?

1479
01:20:39.077 --> 01:20:41.255
Iris. I need you to get us out
of these damn villain chairs.

1480
01:20:41.356 --> 01:20:43.016
She can't. Brad.
She's not powerful enough.

1481
01:20:43.116 --> 01:20:45.056
Okay. well. do something then!

1482
01:20:45.156 --> 01:20:46.616
Satellite's too slow. we'll never make it.

1483
01:20:46.715 --> 01:20:48.776
Unless I build a new hacking app.

1484
01:20:48.876 --> 01:20:51.455
Which I have. by the way.
because I actually look ahead…

1485
01:20:51.554 --> 01:20:54.915
James. get me out of these
villain chairs now!

1486
01:20:57.955 --> 01:20:59.495
-Open his eyes.
-Okay.

1487
01:20:59.595 --> 01:21:01.214
Yes. it worked! I have to call Brad.

1488
01:21:01.313 --> 01:21:03.313
Do it. just do it!

1489
01:21:04.193 --> 01:21:07.554
-Done.
-Villain chair deactivated.

1490
01:21:08.954 --> 01:21:10.952
Okay.

1491
01:21:12.952 --> 01:21:13.853
Veronica.

1492
01:21:13.952 --> 01:21:15.293
Hey.

1493
01:21:15.393 --> 01:21:17.393
Okay. Dammit.

1494
01:21:18.353 --> 01:21:20.012
I need an activation code now!

1495
01:21:20.112 --> 01:21:22.331
[James] Jennifer's on the line
with some missile deactivation codes.

1496
01:21:22.432 --> 01:21:24.092
In fact. she's got incredible timing.
Seriously. incredible.

1497
01:21:24.192 --> 01:21:26.132
[Jennifer] God damn it. James!
Put me through!

1498
01:21:26.232 --> 01:21:29.211
Brad! You need to enter in
the following numbers.

1499
01:21:29.312 --> 01:21:30.291
Give me the damn number.

1500
01:21:30.391 --> 01:21:31.411
Seven. one. eight…

1501
01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:33.331
-What is the number?

1502
01:21:33.431 --> 01:21:35.431
Seven. one. eight…

1503
01:21:36.670 --> 01:21:38.331
Stop that. what're you doing?

1504
01:21:38.431 --> 01:21:39.731
Eight. I said eight!

1505
01:21:39.831 --> 01:21:41.450
Just tell me the damn code.

1506
01:21:41.550 --> 01:21:43.809
-I am telling you the code.
-I can't hear you.

1507
01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:46.010
Two. one. six. nine. six. nine.

1508
01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:47.090
It didn't work!

1509
01:21:47.190 --> 01:21:48.410
Hang on. just wait!

1510
01:21:48.510 --> 01:21:49.490
Oh. God. it's changing!

1511
01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:51.608
Just tell me the damn number. Jennifer!

1512
01:21:51.709 --> 01:21:55.129
-Two. one. four. seven. five. nine.
-[computer] Nine. eight. seven.

1513
01:21:55.229 --> 01:21:57.608
-Did it work? Brad?
-Six.. five. four.

1514
01:21:57.709 --> 01:21:58.769
-Three.
-Brad?

1515
01:21:58.869 --> 01:22:00.867
Two. One.

1516
01:22:09.148 --> 01:22:10.487
Okay. yes!

1517
01:22:10.586 --> 01:22:12.327
Oh. thank God. it worked!

1518
01:22:12.427 --> 01:22:16.887
Okay. Iris. James?
James. why is Iris dead?

1519
01:22:16.987 --> 01:22:18.847
I had to kill her.
Side effect I'm working on.

1520
01:22:18.947 --> 01:22:20.246
She couldn't handle a big load.

1521
01:22:20.346 --> 01:22:22.806
Oh no. I need you
to start Veronica's heart.

1522
01:22:22.906 --> 01:22:25.366
Oh. yeah. sure. Let me just
whip out my instant heart starter

1523
01:22:25.465 --> 01:22:27.005
-and teleport it over.
-James. c'mon.

1524
01:22:27.106 --> 01:22:29.566
The gun. I dunno?
Maybe just turn it on full?

1525
01:22:29.666 --> 01:22:31.565
On full? I thought you said
that would kill someone.

1526
01:22:31.665 --> 01:22:32.925
She's already dead.

1527
01:22:33.025 --> 01:22:35.205
Okay. good point.
What's the worst that can happen?

1528
01:22:35.304 --> 01:22:37.385
I dunno. okay? Maybe just. I don't know.

1529
01:22:37.945 --> 01:22:40.604
Well. worst case. she could explode.

1530
01:22:40.704 --> 01:22:42.924
-Explode?! Fuck!
-Could get messy.

1531
01:22:43.023 --> 01:22:44.604
Just press it right up
to her chest. Maybe.

1532
01:22:44.704 --> 01:22:47.964
Actually. I dunno. just do whatever
feels natural for you.

1533
01:22:48.063 --> 01:22:50.463
Please work.
'cause I really. really like you.

[dramatic orchestral music playing]

1536
01:23:11.821 --> 01:23:13.821
Veronica?

1537
01:23:15.821 --> 01:23:18.420
Hey. Veronica. Hey.

1538
01:23:21.099 --> 01:23:22.960
Hey.

1539
01:23:23.059 --> 01:23:25.059
What happened?

1540
01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:26.760
It's a long story.

1541
01:23:26.860 --> 01:23:29.820
I'll explain it on the train ride home.

1542
01:23:38.019 --> 01:23:40.419
Thank you. James. I really mean that.

1543
01:23:41.178 --> 01:23:43.598
Really? I really appreciate that. Brad.

1544
01:23:43.697 --> 01:23:45.838
'cause. you know. I just
feel really undervalued down here.

1545
01:23:45.938 --> 01:23:47.758
and I feel like no one appreciates
all the work that I do.

1546
01:23:47.858 --> 01:23:49.318
and I do so much around here.

1547
01:23:49.418 --> 01:23:50.797
and people just think I'm this. like.

1548
01:23:50.897 --> 01:23:54.257
