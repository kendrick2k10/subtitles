the night you stayed over.

that you couldn't date me or anybody else

00:07:42.083 --> 00:07:45.083
I mean. we've been together
for six months. and…

167
00:07:46.208 --> 00:07:49.833
I just feel like
we're not really getting any closer.

168
00:07:49.916 --> 00:07:52.500
- I mean. I don't know that much about you.
- Yes. you do.

169
00:07:52.583 --> 00:07:54.625
- Uh…
- I-- Look. I'll tell you anything.

170
00:07:54.708 --> 00:07:55.666
I'm an open book.

171
00:07:55.750 --> 00:08:00.250
Look. if this is a waste of my time.
I just want to know. Okay?

172
00:08:00.333 --> 00:08:01.416
Define "waste."

173
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:03.916
[chuckles dryly]

174
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
You just did.

175
00:08:06.666 --> 00:08:07.500
Wow.

176
00:08:07.583 --> 00:08:09.000
Happy birthday.

177
00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:12.541
No! Come-- Come on.

178
00:08:13.041 --> 00:08:14.833
- It's over. Peter.
- It-- It's…

179
00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:22.416
And she took the car.

["Bye Bye Love" by The Cars plays]

181
00:08:25.875 --> 00:08:28.666
- Okay. did you take your antihistamine?
- Check.

182
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:30.541
- Nasal spray?
- Check.

183
00:08:30.625 --> 00:08:32.250
Good! Good to go!

184
00:08:34.291 --> 00:08:35.833
- Morning. team! Hey!
- [Debbie] Oh!

185
00:08:36.458 --> 00:08:40.291
Ladybugs are kicking some ass
in the garden out here.

186
00:08:40.375 --> 00:08:42.208
You guys do the same. Have a great one.

187
00:08:42.291 --> 00:08:45.083
- [Debbie] Right back at you. Zen.
- I'll be right here!

188
00:08:45.583 --> 00:08:47.916

{\an8}Hey. um. I talked to Alexander's mom
about providing an alternative dessert

204
00:09:51.708 --> 00:09:54.083
{\an8}at the birthday party
because of all your allergies.

205
00:09:54.166 --> 00:09:55.083
{\an8}Okay. don't forget--

206
00:09:55.166 --> 00:09:57.958
{\an8}You gotta be kidding me. Mom.
That's so embarrassing.

207
00:09:58.041 --> 00:10:00.500
{\an8}Do you still hang out with Wade? Hi. Wade!

208
00:10:00.583 --> 00:10:02.041
{\an8}- [Peter] Mom! No.
- [Debbie] What?

209
00:10:02.125 --> 00:10:04.958
{\an8}- What? He's one of my students!
- Gosh. you're not a teacher.

210
00:10:05.041 --> 00:10:07.375
{\an8}Technically. I work here.
Let me get your lunch.

211
00:10:07.458 --> 00:10:09.666
{\an8}Um. you guys used
to hang out all the time.

212
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.708
{\an8}He used to come for sleepovers.

213
00:10:11.791 --> 00:10:15.458
{\an8}Here. let me put this in your bag.
Didn't he pee on our sofa once?

214
00:10:15.541 --> 00:10:16.541
{\an8}Mom!

215
00:10:17.083 --> 00:10:18.166
{\an8}What? He did!

216
00:10:19.583 --> 00:10:21.458
{\an8}- Hey. girl. Hey.
- Oh. my God. hey.

217
00:10:21.541 --> 00:10:22.583
{\an8}[laughs]

218
00:10:22.666 --> 00:10:25.000
{\an8}Do you want to have
some of my terrible office coffee?

219
00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:26.333
{\an8}- I have this.
- Oh. okay.

220
00:10:26.416 --> 00:10:28.541
{\an8}- But. yes. of course.
- Well. let's do it.

221
00:10:28.625 --> 00:10:31.208
{\an8}- Uh. so. are you packed?
- [Debbie] Yes. I am packed.

222
00:10:31.291 --> 00:10:35.875
{\an8}I have to say. I am so glad
you're finally taking a vacay.

223
00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:39.750
What? A-- No. I am not going on vacay.
I have explained this to you!

224
00:10:39.833 --> 00:10:42.291
I have to finish this program
before the end of the year

225
00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:44.958
so that I can apply
for that open Senior Accounting position

226
00:10:45.041 --> 00:10:46.416
at the Regional School District.

227
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:50.333
Oh. I love it when you say
a bunch of sexy words like that.

228
00:10:50.416 --> 00:10:51.250
[chuckles]

229
00:10:51.333 --> 00:10:52.875
Yeah. I just-- I need the money.

230
00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:56.083
Jack's eczema medicine
is only gonna be covered by my insurance

231
00:10:56.166 --> 00:10:58.375
for the next six months.
and then it's. like…

232
00:10:58.458 --> 00:11:00.166
- One thousand dollars.
- Yes!

233
00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:04.958
One thousand GD dollars a month!
So. no. not a vacay.

234
00:11:05.041 --> 00:11:08.541
All right. all right. Well. I just hope
that when you're in New York.

235
00:11:08.625 --> 00:11:11.666
you will take time
to do something nice for yourself.

236
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:14.083
Maybe take a bath. Relax.

237
00:11:14.166 --> 00:11:16.666
That's what I love to do
when I travel. I like to take a bath.

238
00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:20.375
and not hear
either of my kids yell. "I'm hungry!"

239
00:11:20.458 --> 00:11:22.166
Are they just always hungry?

240
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:24.916
- Well. never feed 'em. so…
- Ever?

241
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.291
Wait. why can't Jimmy
come here to watch Jack?

242
00:11:27.375 --> 00:11:29.625
It's peak climbing season.
He has to be out there.

243
00:11:29.708 --> 00:11:31.666
Oh. my God. you are so nice about him.

244
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:35.583
If my ex was a mountain climber
and spent ten months out of every year

245
00:11:35.666 --> 00:11:38.833
traveling the world
with some hot 33-year-old

246
00:11:38.916 --> 00:11:40.541
covered in tattoos…

247
00:11:41.041 --> 00:11:43.375
Have you been looking at her Instagram?

248
00:11:43.458 --> 00:11:47.250
You think I'm not gonna be looking
at Jimmy's girlfriend's Instagram account?

249
00:11:47.333 --> 00:11:50.541
I mean. what are we even doing?
Who would I even be?

250
00:11:50.625 --> 00:11:53.250
Look. it's fine.
It works for him. it works for me.

251
00:11:53.333 --> 00:11:55.166
Besides. Jack loves
hanging out with Scarlet.

252
00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:58.208
All right. well. I hope that you get
what you want out of this trip.

253
00:11:58.291 --> 00:12:00.166
- Yes.
- And what you need.

254
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:03.541
You know. get your degree.
find a man. come home.

255
00:12:03.625 --> 00:12:06.291
and then remodel
that ancient kitchen of yours.

256
00:12:06.375 --> 00:12:08.875
I also think it's time
to get layers in your hair.

257
00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.625
Layers. but not bangs.

258
00:12:10.708 --> 00:12:12.458
Bangs are for an emergency.

259
00:12:12.541 --> 00:12:14.958
Wow. you really have
all the answers to my life figured out.

260
00:12:15.041 --> 00:12:16.083
Yeah. well. we're friends.

261
00:12:16.166 --> 00:12:18.791
Obviously. I have
well-thought-out critiques

262
00:12:18.875 --> 00:12:21.416
of every choice you've ever made.

263
00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.083
And all the fixes.

264
00:12:23.166 --> 00:12:26.166
So. if you end up going
on this Manhattan adventure

265
00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:30.625
and find yourself a hottie.
might I suggest a manicure.

266
00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:33.458
Maybe get waxed.
You know. spruce it up a bit.

267
00:12:33.541 --> 00:12:35.250
Waxed? Oh. my--

268
00:12:35.333 --> 00:12:37.791
- Oh. "waxed."
- Waxed.

269
00:12:37.875 --> 00:12:40.291
Oh. well. that's just not gonna happen.

270
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:45.833
[woman gasps and screams]

271
00:12:45.916 --> 00:12:49.833
I beg of you. sir!
Please. don't hurt me!

272
00:12:49.916 --> 00:12:52.125
No. no. Okay. don't--
Don't judge that. Don't judge that.

273
00:12:52.208 --> 00:12:53.833
I'm gonna do it again. Okay.

274
00:12:54.583 --> 00:12:58.500
I beg of you. sir. do not hurt me!

275
00:12:59.458 --> 00:13:00.458
Was that good?

276
00:13:01.125 --> 00:13:03.291
- Incredible.
- Hey. Scarlet.

277
00:13:03.375 --> 00:13:05.291
- Hey. Deb! Um--
- What's going on?

278
00:13:05.375 --> 00:13:08.041
- Well. I got an audition!
- What?

279
00:13:08.125 --> 00:13:11.916
Ah. yeah! It's for a TV series
set in the '20s about this serial killer.

280
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.708
and I would play a maid
who gets strangled by the lead.

281
00:13:17.291 --> 00:13:19.750
Okay. can I try this out? Okay.

282
00:13:20.666 --> 00:13:24.250
[in raspy voice] I beg of you. sir!
Please don't hurt me!

283
00:13:24.333 --> 00:13:26.833
[normally] I was being strangled.
Did you get that? How was that?

284
00:13:28.666 --> 00:13:29.500
Honestly?

285
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:31.416
Nailed it.

286
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.958
I'm probably not gonna get this anyway
'cause I don't get anything.

287
00:13:34.041 --> 00:13:37.250
Hey. you never know. Um. listen.
did you get the emails that I sent

288
00:13:37.333 --> 00:13:39.208
about what to do with Jack
while I'm out of town?

289
00:13:39.291 --> 00:13:41.916
- Yep. yep. yep! We're on it! Right. Jack?
- Yeah!

290
00:13:42.583 --> 00:13:45.291
- Deb. I gotta say. I'm so happy for you.
- Oh!

291
00:13:45.375 --> 00:13:47.500
It's. like. really cool and inspirational.

292
00:13:47.583 --> 00:13:50.541
this whole accounting thing
or-- or whatever.

293
00:13:50.625 --> 00:13:52.375
It's so funny
that you're a numbers person.

294
00:13:52.458 --> 00:13:54.166
'cause I thought you liked books.

295
00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.750
So. I-- Why aren't you doing
something with. like. booky-books?

296
00:13:58.416 --> 00:14:00.041
Well. this degree is practical.

297
00:14:00.125 --> 00:14:02.416
which is what you have to be
when you're a single mom.

298
00:14:03.083 --> 00:14:04.541
Oh. right.

299
00:14:05.083 --> 00:14:07.208
Right. right. Tragic.

300
00:14:07.291 --> 00:14:08.458
[Scarlet sighs]

301
00:14:08.541 --> 00:14:10.250
[man] <i>It's just such a waste.</i>

302
00:14:11.416 --> 00:14:12.416
"A waste."

303
00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:17.458
Look. we know that our consulting period
with you is up. but--

304
00:14:17.541 --> 00:14:18.750
Yeah. we were just hoping

305
00:14:18.833 --> 00:14:21.291
for a little more time
to get to know you better.

306
00:14:21.375 --> 00:14:24.041
Guys. you know me so well.

307
00:14:24.125 --> 00:14:26.458
We spent so much time together
over the last six months.

308
00:14:26.541 --> 00:14:28.041
Yeah. we did. and it's been…

309
00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:31.083
- It's been amazing.
- Amazing.

310
00:14:31.166 --> 00:14:34.500
Um. you know. we're just wondering.
what happens next?

311
00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.416
Next. I move on.

312
00:14:39.333 --> 00:14:41.125
I'm really sorry.

313
00:14:41.666 --> 00:14:42.500
Come with us.

314
00:14:43.083 --> 00:14:46.041
We just-- We need a new CMO
and it should be you. it's so obvious.

315
00:14:46.125 --> 00:14:47.541
- Yes!
- Guys. I'm sorry.

316
00:14:47.625 --> 00:14:49.416
It's just not on the table for me.

317
00:14:51.875 --> 00:14:53.333
I-- Look. look. don't be sad.

318
00:14:53.416 --> 00:14:55.708
- Nope. It's fine. Yeah. No. I--
- [Peter mutters]

319
00:14:55.791 --> 00:14:57.666
This is just how it has to be.

320
00:14:59.166 --> 00:15:00.666
I don't know if I like you anymore.

321
00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:03.291
[sighs] Oh. it's getting ugly.

322
00:15:03.375 --> 00:15:05.000
I knew it was gonna get ugly.

323
00:15:05.083 --> 00:15:08.708
You can. um. take my contact
and erase it from your phone.

324
00:15:09.291 --> 00:15:11.083
[Peter] I don't have it in my phone.

325
00:15:11.708 --> 00:15:14.458
Well. then put it in your phone
and then erase it. [exhales]

326
00:15:14.541 --> 00:15:17.041
- He's sorry. We're sorry. He didn't--
- No. it's okay.

327
00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:20.041
Listen. Peter. if this is happening.

328

00:23:24.541 --> 00:23:25.458
[engine starts]

496
00:23:25.541 --> 00:23:27.541
["Just What I Needed" by The Cars plays]

497
00:23:27.625 --> 00:23:29.291
<i>♪ I don't mind you hanging out ♪</i>

498
00:23:30.291 --> 00:23:32.833
<i>♪ And talking in your sleep ♪</i>

499
00:23:34.625 --> 00:23:37.791
<i>- ♪ I guess you're just what I needed ♪</i>
<i>- ♪ Just what I needed ♪</i>

500
00:23:38.666 --> 00:23:42.166
My mom hates convertibles. you know?
She says they roll over too easily.

501
00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:45.583
Yeah. well. they're also awesome.
so that negates the rolling part.

502
00:23:46.875 --> 00:23:50.041
Hey. let me ask you a question.
Those kids back there.

503
00:23:50.541 --> 00:23:52.541
they were blowing you off.
What was that about?

504
00:23:57.416 --> 00:23:58.250
Look. man.

505
00:23:58.875 --> 00:24:01.250
I was a 13-year-old boy once. all right?

506
00:24:01.333 --> 00:24:04.083
And I know I'm pretty cool now.

507
00:24:04.666 --> 00:24:08.875
but when I was 13 I was basically
a walking Adam's apple with a bowl cut

508
00:24:08.958 --> 00:24:11.916
and a tattered copy
of <i>Catcher in the Rye </i>under my arm. so…

509
00:24:12.791 --> 00:24:14.125
Plus. I didn't have a dad.

510
00:24:15.666 --> 00:24:17.500
He bailed on me when I was 13.

511
00:24:18.125 --> 00:24:21.083
then he died three years later.
drunk in a ditch.

512
00:24:21.583 --> 00:24:25.291
He was walking along the side of the road
and he just went "bloop."

513
00:24:25.875 --> 00:24:26.708
Oh. my God.

514
00:24:26.791 --> 00:24:28.666
So. seriously.
whatever you're going through.

515
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:31.000
I've probably seen worse.
so you can hit me with it.

516
00:24:32.625 --> 00:24:35.458
- Well. give it to me. Jack Be Nimble.
- I don't even understand that one.

517
00:24:35.541 --> 00:24:37.583
Look. I'm still workshopping. okay?

518
00:24:38.291 --> 00:24:39.625
[sighs]

519
00:24:39.708 --> 00:24:41.083
It's because of hockey.

520
00:24:43.333 --> 00:24:44.166
Okay.

521
00:24:44.875 --> 00:24:47.958
Wade and I were friends.
and we used to skate at the rink together.

522
00:24:48.041 --> 00:24:50.291
but now he plays on the team and I can't.

523
00:24:50.375 --> 00:24:52.208
So he hangs out with Evan. who does.

524
00:24:52.875 --> 00:24:54.708
So we just stopped hanging at all.

525
00:24:54.791 --> 00:24:58.375
Whoa. wait. you play hockey?
Well. Debbie never told me that.

526
00:24:59.000 --> 00:24:59.916
Yeah.

527
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.291
I can't play basketball
'cause I'm allergic to the gym.

528
00:25:02.375 --> 00:25:05.250
and I can't play baseball
'cause I'm allergic to grass.

529
00:25:05.333 --> 00:25:07.333
Wait- I don't understand
why you can't play on the team

530
00:25:07.416 --> 00:25:10.000
with Wade and his weaselly friend.
Oh. I'm sorry. He--

531
00:25:10.083 --> 00:25:13.000
He's probably not weaselly.
but. like. he's got a weasel face.

532
00:25:13.583 --> 00:25:16.458
You know? So. but--
Why can't you play on the team?

533
00:25:17.458 --> 00:25:18.666
I'm too small.

534
00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:20.500
Mom says it's too dangerous.

535
00:25:23.125 --> 00:25:25.791
I cannot believe your mom
didn't tell me about this.

536
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:28.250
Like. she tells me everything.

537
00:25:29.291 --> 00:25:32.000
But do you? Tell her everything?

538
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:35.083
Of course.

539
00:25:48.458 --> 00:25:50.833
[Peter] <i>I never understood why Debbie</i>

540
00:25:51.375 --> 00:25:54.333
decided to buy a house
on the side of a whole entire hill.

541
00:25:54.416 --> 00:25:55.250
Yeah.

542
00:25:56.666 --> 00:25:58.791
I suppose you get used to it
after a while. huh?

543
00:25:58.875 --> 00:26:00.583
No. It continues to suck.

544
00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:03.750
Who lived here before you.
like. an alpaca?

545
00:26:04.416 --> 00:26:06.666
- [Zen grunts]
- [shears snipping]

546
00:26:07.166 --> 00:26:09.250
- [Peter] Hey!
- Hey! Oh!

547
00:26:09.333 --> 00:26:11.791
Yeah! Yo. Jack.

548
00:26:11.875 --> 00:26:13.500
You're the guy-- You're the dude

549
00:26:13.583 --> 00:26:15.750
that's. uh. gonna be hanging
with. uh. Jack.

550
00:26:16.333 --> 00:26:17.916
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm Zen.

551
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.208
Yeah. like the Buddhism.

552
00:26:19.291 --> 00:26:22.291
I live through the gate there.
and. uh. I'm independently wealthy

553
00:26:22.375 --> 00:26:23.500
due to a tech buyout.

554
00:26:23.583 --> 00:26:25.208
- Of course.
- I surf in the AM.

555
00:26:25.291 --> 00:26:27.916
Spend the rest of the day
here in Debbie's garden.

556
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.666
- What about your yard?
- My yard?

557
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:32.208
Oh. I don't do my yard.
I got a guy for that.

558
00:26:32.875 --> 00:26:34.291
There he is. Hey!

559
00:26:34.375 --> 00:26:36.291
- [man] Yeah?
- [laughs] Yeah!

560
00:26:36.375 --> 00:26:38.666
Dude. he's so funny.

561
00:26:39.291 --> 00:26:40.333
[chuckles]

562
00:26:40.416 --> 00:26:41.750
He's from Spokane.

563
00:26:42.416 --> 00:26:45.333
Okay. Well. it was nice to meet you.

564
00:26:45.416 --> 00:26:46.416
Nice to meet you.

565
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.458
- Okay.
- [Jack] Bye. Zen.

566
00:26:50.291 --> 00:26:53.125
All right. back at it. [grunts]

567
00:26:53.208 --> 00:26:55.708
- [Jack] You didn't know about Zen?
- [Peter] Nope.

568
00:26:55.791 --> 00:26:59.125
{\an8}So the whole thing where you and Mom
tell each other everything--

569
00:26:59.208 --> 00:27:01.791
Yeah. no. we're not gonna--
That's grown-up talk.

570
00:27:01.875 --> 00:27:03.791
[door opens and closes]

571
00:27:05.375 --> 00:27:06.375
Okay.

572
00:27:07.208 --> 00:27:12.041
Did she stay up all night doing this?

573
00:27:12.666 --> 00:27:13.833
Your mom's crazy.

574
00:27:13.916 --> 00:27:15.500
[emphatically] I am well aware.

575
00:27:16.125 --> 00:27:17.375
[phone ringing]

576
00:27:17.458 --> 00:27:19.375
All right. let's. um…

577
00:27:21.166 --> 00:27:23.750
[Debbie on phone] <i>Oh. hey!</i>
<i>I made it. I'm in Brooklyn.</i>

578
00:27:24.583 --> 00:27:27.166
Are-- Are you home yet?
Did you see my Post-Its?

579
00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:29.958
- Yeah. they're kinda hard to miss. Deb.
- Okay.

580
00:27:30.041 --> 00:27:32.458
The most important thing
is that you feed him breakfast.

581
00:27:32.541 --> 00:27:34.958
then you pack his lunch.
and then you pick up his prescriptions

582
00:27:35.041 --> 00:27:35.875
on the way to school.

583
00:27:35.958 --> 00:27:36.791
Uh-huh.

584
00:27:36.875 --> 00:27:39.375
Oh. and the other most important thing
is that you get the list

585
00:27:39.458 --> 00:27:42.000
of things that he's allergic to.
It's right by the coffee maker.

586
00:27:42.083 --> 00:27:44.875
- Oh! Excuse me.
- Oh. wow. Laminated. Nice.

587
00:27:44.958 --> 00:27:47.166
- Oh. this one says "urgent."
- Yeah.

588
00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:49.333
And I forgot to label
the nut-free nut butter.

589
00:27:49.416 --> 00:27:51.208
But it's in there. It's in the… Do you--

590
00:27:51.291 --> 00:27:53.250
- Yeah.
- I don't know what that is.

591
00:27:53.333 --> 00:27:55.833
Oh. and Jack. Jack.
have you started your history paper?

592
00:27:55.916 --> 00:27:56.833
Already started it.

593
00:27:56.916 --> 00:27:59.666
Okay. that means he's done nothing. Peter.
You have to remind him.

594
00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:01.125
Okay. he has to pick a thesis.

595
00:28:01.208 --> 00:28:04.416
He's doing the Spanish-American War.
which is. I think. against Spain.

596
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:05.833
- Yeah. Deb?
- I'm not sure.

597
00:28:05.916 --> 00:28:08.541
- Jack is okay.
- Oh. hi! [laughs]

598
00:28:09.041 --> 00:28:12.166
Oh. my gosh.
There are so many people here. It's crazy.

599
00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:14.083
We're gonna figure out dinner.

600
00:28:14.875 --> 00:28:18.250
Oh. no. you don't have to worry about it.
because I left dinner.

601
00:28:18.333 --> 00:28:19.500
O-- Open the freezer.

602
00:28:21.541 --> 00:28:24.708
- [Peter] Wait. this also says "urgent."
- Jack loves those casseroles.

603
00:28:24.791 --> 00:28:27.041
- [mouthing]
- You know. I could-- I could buy dinner.

604
00:28:27.125 --> 00:28:29.083
Peter. I know
that you have a lot of money.

605
00:28:29.166 --> 00:28:31.083
but I really don't want you
getting him take-out.

606
00:28:31.166 --> 00:28:33.125
and-- and other things that are fancy.

607
00:28:33.208 --> 00:28:36.750
Yeah. okay! Homework.
and then frozen… [mutters] …for dinner.

608
00:28:36.833 --> 00:28:39.000
I know there's something else
I forgot to tell you.

609
00:28:39.083 --> 00:28:40.750
Shoot. I forgot what I forgot to tell you.

610
00:28:40.833 --> 00:28:41.833
Debbie. stop.

611
00:28:43.291 --> 00:28:44.375
T-- Take a breath.

612
00:28:44.458 --> 00:28:45.416
[exhales heavily]

613
00:28:46.583 --> 00:28:47.500
Look around.

614
00:28:47.583 --> 00:28:49.166
[cheerful music plays]

615
00:28:51.291 --> 00:28:53.833
Yeah. enjoy it.

616
00:28:55.333 --> 00:28:56.541
- Call us later.
- Okay.

617
00:29:02.916 --> 00:29:05.083
- You allergic to Mexican food?
- No.

618
00:29:14.458 --> 00:29:15.333
[grunts]

619
00:29:16.416 --> 00:29:17.708
Excuse me. pardon me.

620
00:29:21.083 --> 00:29:22.000
[Debbie sighs]

621
00:29:23.416 --> 00:29:26.625
Uh. um. excuse me.
I'm gonna go to Peter Coleman's.

622
00:29:27.166 --> 00:29:29.958
You know. they make those
with four wheels now.

623
00:29:30.041 --> 00:29:31.583
They're called "spinners."

624
00:29:32.125 --> 00:29:33.958
- [elevator bell rings]
- Right. so…

625
00:29:35.291 --> 00:29:36.125
Got it.

626
00:29:43.375 --> 00:29:44.666
Oh. my God.

627
00:29:47.791 --> 00:29:49.375
This is gorgeous.

628
00:29:51.916 --> 00:29:53.958
Oh. my God. [sighs heavily]

629
00:29:58.500 --> 00:29:59.666
Whoa.

630
00:30:01.625 --> 00:30:02.458
What!?

631
00:30:03.708 --> 00:30:05.458
By color? Really?

632
00:30:05.541 --> 00:30:07.416
Oh. my God. Peter.

633
00:30:08.458 --> 00:30:11.125
[breathes deeply]

634
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.250
Wait. where are the handles?
How do you even open this?

635
00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:19.750
What is this?

636
00:30:21.541 --> 00:30:23.125
Oh! [chuckles]

637
00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:25.625
That's just sad.

638
00:30:31.291 --> 00:30:32.583
Peter. [scoffs]

639
00:30:33.083 --> 00:30:34.083
[groans softly]

640
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:35.583
[sighs]

641
00:30:38.833 --> 00:30:40.416
They still have stickers on them.

642
00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:45.500
Twenty-five dollars for a glass?
Oh. my God.

643
00:30:45.583 --> 00:30:46.541
[scratching]

644
00:30:46.625 --> 00:30:47.750
Peter.

645
00:30:47.833 --> 00:30:50.083
Just because you can
doesn't mean you should.

646
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.208
Okay… what should we do?

647
00:30:53.791 --> 00:30:56.208
Well. I have homework
that I should probably do.

648
00:30:56.291 --> 00:30:57.916
God. I just got here!

649
00:30:58.416 --> 00:31:00.333
What-- It's-- [blabbers]
This is our night!

650
00:31:00.416 --> 00:31:02.791
It's our occasion! We're having
a special-- We're occasioning!

651
00:31:02.875 --> 00:31:05.416
- It's-- That's not a word.
- It is now!

652
00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.750
Let's-- We can-- We can watch a movie.

653
00:31:08.625 --> 00:31:09.666
[Jack] Yeah. no.

654
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:12.291
We have three remotes. Uh. can I see that?

655
00:31:12.375 --> 00:31:16.791
This one controls the TV
and it makes sure the DVD player isn't on.

656
00:31:16.875 --> 00:31:19.208
- This one controls the sound.
- Oh. yeah. I was gonna do that.

657
00:31:19.291 --> 00:31:20.666
It's all volume.

658
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:24.958
This one controls the cable
to make sure the Wi-Fi is working.

659
00:31:25.041 --> 00:31:27.958
And. oh. yeah.
This one also is the receiver.

660
00:31:28.041 --> 00:31:29.625
Got that sequence.

661
00:31:29.708 --> 00:31:32.916
But I'm not supposed
to watch TV while I eat.

662
00:31:34.291 --> 00:31:36.791

that there is a gentleman
and his butt crack

Oh. yeah. that's Zen.
He just-- He's around a lot.

a really great job with the garden

Um. did I not mention Zen?

but what happened with Minka?

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:22.916
All right. need a knife…

829
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.833
- [clattering]
- Hey. now!

830
00:39:26.583 --> 00:39:27.625
Oh. hey. man.

831
00:39:28.541 --> 00:39:29.375
Hey!

832
00:39:30.416 --> 00:39:32.250
- Yeah.
- What are we doing here?

833
00:39:33.333 --> 00:39:35.708
I'm just… I gotta…

834
00:39:35.791 --> 00:39:36.791
Holy shit.

835
00:39:41.375 --> 00:39:42.375
Jack?

836
00:39:42.458 --> 00:39:44.166
Okay. let's do this.

837
00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:47.958
Hey. what's this thing do
besides release a genie? [chuckles]

838
00:39:48.041 --> 00:39:49.583
It flushes out my sinuses.

839
00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:51.083
Gross.

840
00:39:51.666 --> 00:39:52.916
Did you make lunch?

841
00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:56.750
- I'm working on it.
- What about breakfast?

842
00:39:58.666 --> 00:40:02.916
You didn't make breakfast.
did you? Okay. [sighs]

843
00:40:06.458 --> 00:40:08.833
- Gluten-free pancakes for you.
- [Jack] Thanks.

844
00:40:08.916 --> 00:40:10.416
- Thank you.
- For you.

845
00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:11.833
Oh. thank you.

846
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:15.291
- Can I get one of those?
- No.

847
00:40:15.375 --> 00:40:17.333
- Check the laminated card.
- No.

848
00:40:17.416 --> 00:40:21.500
- I'm not allergic to coffee. Come on.
- You're not drinking coffee. Let's focus.

849
00:40:22.875 --> 00:40:25.583
These neti pots. and packed lunches.

850
00:40:25.666 --> 00:40:28.125
breakfasts. age-appropriate movies?

851
00:40:28.208 --> 00:40:30.666
Not my thing. not my strength. right?

852
00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:34.000
But that's okay.
'cause I'm here to focus on you.

853
00:40:34.625 --> 00:40:37.958
Okay. and my-- my work here
is very simple.

854
00:40:38.041 --> 00:40:42.083
It's to teach you to tell a story
to other people about you

855
00:40:42.166 --> 00:40:44.666
that is better than the story
that you tell yourself.

856
00:40:45.166 --> 00:40:47.625
'Cause the stories
we tell ourselves are very limiting.

857
00:40:48.375 --> 00:40:51.083
- I'm not following. What do you mean?
- Okay. example.

858
00:40:51.166 --> 00:40:53.666
Look. let's take someone
we both know. your mom.

859
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:56.625
- Okay.
- Your mom is the smartest person I know.

860
00:40:56.708 --> 00:40:59.625
Okay? When we first met.
she was extremely ambitious.

861
00:40:59.708 --> 00:41:02.916
She wanted to be an editor.
or whatever. but then over time.

862
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.333
she started to believe
that she had to be practical.

863
00:41:07.416 --> 00:41:09.000
and she had to be sensible.

864
00:41:09.083 --> 00:41:12.666
and that is the story
that she told herself.

865
00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:14.041
"Be responsible."

866
00:41:15.041 --> 00:41:17.833
- So that's not your story?
- No. co--

867
00:41:17.916 --> 00:41:19.333
Are we talking about me?

868
00:41:19.416 --> 00:41:21.375
Do you always answer
a question with a question?

869
00:41:21.458 --> 00:41:24.000
Do you always answer a question
to a question with a question?

870
00:41:24.083 --> 00:41:26.666
Did you really move to New York
because of the earthquakes?

871
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:30.041
- 'Cause my mom doesn't believe that.
- All right. can we stay on message here?

872
00:41:30.125 --> 00:41:32.166
Okay. look. in the beginning of a rebrand.

873
00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:35.416
I like to do a thing
called a "global realignment." all right?

874
00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:41.333
And that is a gesture to the world.
in your case. Wade and Weasel Face…

875
00:41:43.291 --> 00:41:45.958
Evan. of what you have to offer.

876
00:41:46.833 --> 00:41:50.708
Today. you have to offer these.

877
00:41:50.791 --> 00:41:53.916
- Seats to the Kings game?
- What are-- These aren't seats.

878
00:41:54.416 --> 00:41:56.458
These are tickets to a luxury box.

879
00:41:56.541 --> 00:41:58.375
Isn't that bribing them
to be friends with me?

880
00:41:59.041 --> 00:42:00.916
Ah. and this is
where the rebrand comes in.

881
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.291
So we're gonna rebrand
the word "bribing" with "incentivization."

882
00:42:06.208 --> 00:42:07.291
That's not a word.

883
00:42:07.875 --> 00:42:10.791
In my line of work.
we make up the words that we need.

884
00:42:10.875 --> 00:42:13.041
That's kind of sketch.

885
00:42:13.125 --> 00:42:16.166
Now you're getting it.
There you go. "sketch."

886
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.208
- Look at-- Look at my sketch coffee.
- I really want one of those.

887
00:42:21.208 --> 00:42:24.250
Hey. uh. remember.
I'm gonna pick you up after school.

888
00:42:24.333 --> 00:42:26.625
- We're gonna go to that Kings game. Okay?
- Yeah. okay.

889
00:42:26.708 --> 00:42:30.041
Got it. And we got the big private box
so you can invite whoever you want.

890
00:42:30.125 --> 00:42:32.875
- 'Cause it's the luxury box.
- [Jack] Yeah. See you after school. Peter.

891
00:42:32.958 --> 00:42:35.458
We'll see you after school
when we go to the Kings game!

892
00:42:35.541 --> 00:42:37.583
[Jack. forcefully] Yep. big game!
Let's go!

893
00:42:37.666 --> 00:42:40.125
[Peter] Yeah. with all that candy
and ice cream!

894
00:42:40.791 --> 00:42:43.291
- Hey! Coffee?
- You buying?

895
00:42:44.291 --> 00:42:48.041
Yeah. Oh! Oh. yeah. can we get
one of those. uh… the butter coffees?

896
00:42:48.583 --> 00:42:50.625
- With the butter…
- [sighs] He's miming.

897
00:42:51.625 --> 00:42:52.666
He's miming.

898
00:42:54.375 --> 00:42:55.625
Yes. he is.

899
00:42:55.708 --> 00:42:58.375
- That's actually really good.
- I've been working on it.

Now. we got a lot to cover.
So let's get started here.

First. we're going to start

922
00:44:06.625 --> 00:44:09.541
by reviewing types
of modeling problems and methods.

923

including supervised
versus unsupervised learning.

993
00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:09.291
- He literally had it--
- Guys. guys!

994
00:47:09.375 --> 00:47:11.125
Did you see that last rally?

995
00:47:11.625 --> 00:47:13.208
That was crazy. huh?

996
00:47:13.291 --> 00:47:15.333
That was. like-- That was sketch!

997
00:47:15.416 --> 00:47:17.625
Or as the Canadians would say.
that was sketch. eh?

998
00:47:17.708 --> 00:47:19.000
What is he talking about?

999
00:47:20.916 --> 00:47:23.916
- [Minka] Just be conscious of--
- [server] All right.

1000
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.666
Manhattan Maiden for you.

1001
00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:26.708
Ooh!

1002
00:47:26.791 --> 00:47:29.166
And the Garden Glory for you.

1003
00:47:29.666 --> 00:47:30.541
Oh.

1004
00:47:31.625 --> 00:47:33.333
- Enjoy!
- Thank you. [chuckles]

1005
00:47:33.416 --> 00:47:35.458
Am I supposed to drink it or water it?

1006
00:47:35.541 --> 00:47:37.375
So how did you and Peter meet again?

1007
00:47:37.458 --> 00:47:39.333
Is this the part
where we don't talk about Peter?

1008
00:47:39.416 --> 00:47:40.708
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

1009
00:47:40.791 --> 00:47:41.875
[Minka] This is that part.

1010
00:47:41.958 --> 00:47:44.833
Well. short story. we hooked up once.

1011
00:47:44.916 --> 00:47:47.083
and then he bailed. and we became friends.

1012
00:47:47.625 --> 00:47:49.583
And you married someone else.

1013
00:47:49.666 --> 00:47:53.000
- Mm. Jimmy the mountain climber.
- [Minka] Mm.

1014
00:47:53.083 --> 00:47:57.041
Which is funny. 'cause at the time.
he felt like a safe choice for me.

1015
00:47:57.125 --> 00:47:59.041
- Mm.
- He was just very sure about me.

1016
00:47:59.125 --> 00:48:00.125
Mmm.

1017
00:48:00.208 --> 00:48:03.041
But. ultimately.
he wanted to go on big adventures.

1018
00:48:03.125 --> 00:48:06.375
and my adventures
are reading books and being a mom.

1019
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.375
So. we realized he needed somebody
who always wanted to be by his side

1020
00:48:10.458 --> 00:48:12.000
and that just wasn't gonna be me.

1021
00:48:12.833 --> 00:48:14.291
And your love life now?

1022
00:48:15.458 --> 00:48:16.666
Sort of like…

1023
00:48:17.666 --> 00:48:20.583
wind on an open prairie. or…

1024
00:48:21.583 --> 00:48:23.833
footsteps in an empty attic.

1025
00:48:24.333 --> 00:48:25.666
or what are those…

1026
00:48:26.583 --> 00:48:30.375
Tumbleweeds going through
an old ghost town. Sort of like that.

1027
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.750
Okay. we need to get on that.

1028
00:48:33.375 --> 00:48:35.250
Well. good luck. It's been a minute.

1029
00:48:35.333 --> 00:48:37.625
[men chuckling. conversing indistinctly]

1030
00:48:37.708 --> 00:48:38.791
Oh. I know that guy.

1031
00:48:38.875 --> 00:48:41.208
He's a professor at my school.
the guy with the bow tie.

1032
00:48:41.708 --> 00:48:44.500
- Wow. the guy he is sitting with is…
- [Debbie] Oh. my God.

1033
00:48:44.583 --> 00:48:46.791
I know. He is <i>fuego.</i>

1034
00:48:46.875 --> 00:48:49.708
Oh. no. yes. that--
And that's. uh. Theo Martin.

1035
00:48:49.791 --> 00:48:52.041
He's the editor of Duncan Press.

1036
00:48:52.125 --> 00:48:53.041
[Minka] Mmm.

1037
00:48:53.125 --> 00:48:55.625
They publish
the best contemporary fiction on earth.

1038
00:48:55.708 --> 00:48:58.375
Mmm. yeah.
I only listen to celebrity bios.

1039
00:48:58.458 --> 00:49:00.958
The Rob Lowe one is my favorite.
The first one. of course.

1040
00:49:01.041 --> 00:49:02.916
Theo Martin is so famous.

1041
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.291
Also. he's yummy.
and he's sitting with someone you know.

1042
00:49:06.375 --> 00:49:08.416
- He's very attractive. that's true.
- So. come on.

1043
00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:12.041
Wait. where you going? Oh. oh… okay.
Maybe I should bring my plant.

1044
00:49:12.125 --> 00:49:13.875
[men laughing]

1045
00:49:13.958 --> 00:49:17.208
- It's true. You know. ambitious.
- Hi! Sorry to barge over.

1046
00:49:17.291 --> 00:49:18.958
But we saw you from over there--

1047
00:49:19.041 --> 00:49:21.375
Hold on. you! You were in my class.

1048
00:49:21.458 --> 00:49:24.166
- You came over and I saw… Yeah. hi.
- Yeah! That was me.

1049
00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:26.416
I never forget a denim skirt.

1050
00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:27.500
[mock winces]

1051
00:49:27.583 --> 00:49:31.416
Cute! That's a really cool story!
I'm Minka. This is Debbie. You are?

1052
00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:34.125
- Theo Martin from Duncan Press.
- Yes.

1053
00:49:34.208 --> 00:49:36.916
I recognized you.
I've read every Duncan Press book.

1054
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.333
Wow. Well. not every book.
I mean. no way. [laughs]

1055
00:49:39.416 --> 00:49:40.541
Yes. way!

1056
00:49:41.125 --> 00:49:44.916
Okay. 870-page tome
set on a pirate ship in the South Pacific?

1057
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.708
<i>Hobart's Horizon.</i>
I read it in two days. Ahoy!

1058
00:49:47.791 --> 00:49:49.083
[all laugh]

1059
00:49:49.166 --> 00:49:51.625
All right. spy novel set in Crete.

1060
00:49:51.708 --> 00:49:53.875
Oh. <i>Ocean of Lies!</i>
I mean. one of the best!

1061
00:49:53.958 --> 00:49:57.000
I kept saying for a week.
<i>"Eímai katáskopos!"</i>

1062
00:49:57.083 --> 00:49:59.250
- [laughs]
- [Minka] Sorry?

1063
00:49:59.333 --> 00:50:01.458
- That's. um. Greek for "I am a spy."
- "I am a spy."

1064
00:50:01.541 --> 00:50:03.458
- Sure.
- All right. I got it. I got it.

1065
00:50:03.541 --> 00:50:06.500
You did not read the Dust Bowl book.
because no one read the Dust Bowl book.

1066
00:50:06.583 --> 00:50:09.625
<i>Where The Rattlesnake Sings.</i>
I-- I bought it the day it came out.

1067
00:50:09.708 --> 00:50:13.083
That was you? I'm pretty sure
we only sold the one copy.

1068
00:50:13.166 --> 00:50:14.458
That was me! I bought it!

1069
00:50:14.541 --> 00:50:16.583
[laughs]

1070
00:50:17.708 --> 00:50:18.916
- [Theo] Wow.
- Anyway. yeah.

1071
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.500
[Theo] S-- So many vegetables.

1072
00:50:20.583 --> 00:50:22.083
Oh. I know. isn't this crazy?

1073
00:50:22.166 --> 00:50:25.750
I even said. "Oh. what? Should I get
some dip with my crudité platter?"

1074
00:50:25.833 --> 00:50:26.666
[chuckles]

1075
00:50:27.916 --> 00:50:30.958
- [Minka] It was so nice to meet you both!
- [Theo] Yeah. you too.

1076
00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:34.250
Can I get your number. actually?

1077
00:50:34.333 --> 00:50:37.333
I occasionally have galleys
to give away. signed ones even.

1078
00:50:37.416 --> 00:50:39.416
[gasps] I would love that!

1079
00:50:41.166 --> 00:50:42.208
[Minka] Oh. my God.

1080
00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:44.625
[phone clicks]

1081
00:50:44.708 --> 00:50:46.458
Here. put in your number.

1082
00:50:46.541 --> 00:50:47.458
[Theo] Ah.

1083
00:50:52.333 --> 00:50:53.333
Okay.

1084
00:50:54.041 --> 00:50:55.666
- Okay! Ciao. boys!
- Ciao.

1085
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:58.541
- [professor] We're gonna go this way.
- OMG. he is into you!

1086
00:50:58.625 --> 00:51:01.666
- No. he's not.
- Uh. okay.

1087
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:03.625
- He's being nice.
- No. he's not.

1088
00:51:03.708 --> 00:51:06.041
That is what "into you" looks like.

1089
00:51:06.125 --> 00:51:07.791
[Debbie] Oh. please!

1090
00:51:08.875 --> 00:51:13.500
It's cute how you like the book people.
and how you and Peter actually read books.

1091
00:51:13.583 --> 00:51:14.916
- [sighs]
- It's very cute.

1092
00:51:15.416 --> 00:51:17.708
[Debbie] Yeah.
we always had that in common.

1093
00:51:17.791 --> 00:51:20.083
We were just two
old-fashioned book lovers.

1094
00:51:20.166 --> 00:51:21.541
Yeah. sure.

1095
00:51:21.625 --> 00:51:23.750
And. well. there's the book he wrote.

1096
00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:27.125
- What book?
- Novel. big thing. massive.

1097
00:51:27.208 --> 00:51:28.500
[chuckles] What? No.

1098
00:51:28.583 --> 00:51:31.291
[mock chuckles] "What?" Yeah.

1099
00:51:32.375 --> 00:51:33.583
I don't believe you.

1100
00:51:33.666 --> 00:51:35.666
I'm telling you.
he wrote a whole big fat book.

1101
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:37.583
Keeps it in an envelope in his oven.

1102
00:51:37.666 --> 00:51:39.958
I found it once
when I was trying to bake keto brownies.

1103
00:51:40.041 --> 00:51:41.875
which. by the way. do not recommend.

1104
00:51:41.958 --> 00:51:44.125
Two out of ten.
There's zucchini in the recipe.

1105
00:51:44.208 --> 00:51:47.250
Peter used to want to be a writer.
but he quit when he moved here.

1106
00:51:47.333 --> 00:51:48.791
He-- He doesn't write anymore.

1107
00:51:48.875 --> 00:51:51.666
Uh-huh. Except for the part where…

1108
00:51:55.083 --> 00:51:56.125
he does.

1109
00:52:02.041 --> 00:52:02.958
Open it.

1110
00:52:09.041 --> 00:52:12.166
<i>The Boy</i> by P. Coleman. Peter!

1111
00:52:12.250 --> 00:52:14.833
Wow. You're good at detective-y things.

1112
00:52:14.916 --> 00:52:15.916
Hold on.

1113
00:52:17.291 --> 00:52:20.708
Peter wrote a whole novel
and never mentioned it to me?

1114
00:52:20.791 --> 00:52:21.875
You should read it.

1115
00:52:21.958 --> 00:52:24.083
I didn't read it because it's a book.

1116
00:52:24.166 --> 00:52:25.375
Oh. no. I-- I can't read it.

1117
00:52:25.458 --> 00:52:27.416
If-- If he wanted me to read it.
he would have told me.

1118
00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:29.250
because we tell each other everything.

1119
00:52:29.333 --> 00:52:31.708
I mean. obviously. you don't.

1120
00:52:32.833 --> 00:52:33.666
But we do.

1121
00:52:34.541 --> 00:52:35.375
Okay.

1122
00:52:36.375 --> 00:52:39.541
See. that's the thing.
We tell each other… everything.

1123
00:52:39.625 --> 00:52:40.583
Mmm.

1124
00:52:41.583 --> 00:52:42.583
"Everything."

1125
00:52:44.583 --> 00:52:47.083
[Peter] All right.
this is a minor setback. right?

1126
00:52:47.166 --> 00:52:49.416
This happens all the time
at the beginning of a project.

1127
00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:53.291
What we need to do is pivot. okay?
We're gonna stay with the same approach--

1128
00:52:53.375 --> 00:52:54.458
I don't want to talk.

1129
00:53:01.041 --> 00:53:02.041
[Peter sighs]

1130
00:53:05.375 --> 00:53:06.375
Hey.

1131
00:53:09.166 --> 00:53:10.083
I'm sorry.

1132
00:53:11.875 --> 00:53:12.791
That sucked.

1133
00:53:14.666 --> 00:53:16.500
My problem-solving skills are…

1134
00:53:17.541 --> 00:53:20.500
I guess. more pertain
to the business world.

1135
00:53:21.416 --> 00:53:24.416
Thanks for the tickets.
I enjoyed watching the game.

1136
00:53:25.666 --> 00:53:27.000
Okay. you're being polite.

1137
00:53:28.375 --> 00:53:29.500
This is bad.

1138
00:53:31.083 --> 00:53:31.916
'Night.

1139
00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:35.500
[gentle music playing]

1140
00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:50.375
[grunts softly]

1141
00:53:58.166 --> 00:54:00.125
[sighs]

1142
00:54:07.375 --> 00:54:09.500
[line ringing]

1143
00:54:09.583 --> 00:54:10.666
[Peter] <i>Hey. hi.</i>

1144
00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:12.416
Hey! How are you doing?

1145
00:54:13.291 --> 00:54:16.000
- [Peter] <i>I'm good.</i>
- Good. good.

1146
00:54:16.083 --> 00:54:18.416
<i>Wait. what's wrong? It's--</i>
<i>You're-- It's late where you are.</i>

1147
00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:20.750
Uh. no. You know what?
It sounds echo-y there.

1148
00:54:20.833 --> 00:54:24.166
- Are you in the bathtub?
- No! I don't take baths.

1149
00:54:25.208 --> 00:54:26.583
I don't even get baths.

1150
00:54:26.666 --> 00:54:27.500
Right. right.

1151
00:54:28.541 --> 00:54:30.708
You and I tell
each other everything. right?

1152
00:54:32.166 --> 00:54:33.166
- No.
- What?

1153
00:54:35.250 --> 00:54:36.583
I took Jack to the hockey game

1154
00:54:36.666 --> 00:54:39.333
without asking you first. and he brought
his friends Wade and Evan.

1155
00:54:39.416 --> 00:54:41.208
You got Wade and Evan
to hang out with Jack?

1156
00:54:41.291 --> 00:54:45.458
Yes. I-- Yeah. yes.
And-- And he ate pizza.

1157
00:54:45.541 --> 00:54:48.375
It was gluten-free pizza.
but pizza all the same.

1158

but this book. I mean. it is…
It has a lot of promise.

1323
01:03:11.625 --> 01:03:13.958
Oh. my God. Did you read
the whole thing already?

1324
01:03:14.041 --> 01:03:15.625
That's. like. a shit ton of pages!

1325
01:03:15.708 --> 01:03:17.041
Well. my assistant did.

1326
01:03:17.125 --> 01:03:19.125
She thought it had potential.
and passed it on to me.

1327
01:03:19.208 --> 01:03:20.833
and I gotta say. I-- I agree.

1328
01:03:21.791 --> 01:03:22.666
Wow. [gasps]

1329
01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:25.083
I also see why you cried.
I may have shed a tear myself.

1330
01:03:25.166 --> 01:03:26.208
The dad. right?

1331
01:03:26.291 --> 01:03:30.125
[chuckles] Especially. yeah.
I mean. look. I'm very interested.

1332
01:03:32.791 --> 01:03:33.750
And I would--

1333
01:03:33.833 --> 01:03:36.875
I would really like to speak
to the author as soon as possible.

1334
01:03:36.958 --> 01:03:39.458
The author. You know. can I. um…

1335
01:03:39.541 --> 01:03:42.416
I had a really big coffee on the way here.
I just need to tinkle.

1336
01:03:43.375 --> 01:03:46.083
Sure. yeah. Most of the tinkling
happens right down the hall.

1337
01:03:46.166 --> 01:03:47.333
Okay.

1338
01:03:48.625 --> 01:03:51.875
- This is insane!
- I know. this place is so old school.

1339
01:03:52.458 --> 01:03:54.041
I smell dead people.

1340
01:03:54.125 --> 01:03:55.666
No. no. no! What am I doing?

1341
01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:59.000
I'm acting crazy!
I know I like to help friends out.

1342
01:03:59.083 --> 01:04:02.291
but that normally means
picking up Alicia's twins at carpool.

1343
01:04:02.375 --> 01:04:04.291
I have to just call Peter.
and put a hold on this.

1344
01:04:04.375 --> 01:04:05.250
Ew. no.

1345
01:04:05.333 --> 01:04:06.291
No?

1346
01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:10.375
You believe in Peter's book.
so why not see this through?

1347
01:04:10.458 --> 01:04:11.666
So. just…

1348
01:04:13.833 --> 01:04:15.666
Yeah! You got this. girl!

1349
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:17.291
Okay. Okay. okay.

1350
01:04:17.375 --> 01:04:19.291
Also. no. I actually do have to pee.

1351
01:04:21.791 --> 01:04:24.666
Theo. I would like
to discuss the next steps.

1352
01:04:25.875 --> 01:04:28.291
Sure. You free for dinner?

1353
01:04:29.625 --> 01:04:30.458
Uh…

1354
01:04:31.708 --> 01:04:32.833
Uh. yes.

1355
01:04:32.916 --> 01:04:34.208
Yes! Sure.

1356
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:35.833
Perfect.

1357
01:04:36.666 --> 01:04:38.250
Perfect. [sighs]

1358
01:04:38.333 --> 01:04:39.333
Perfect!

1359
01:04:46.333 --> 01:04:48.250
- Uh. is that the coach?
- Yeah. that's him.

1360
01:04:48.333 --> 01:04:50.666
All right. you stay here.
Let me do my thing.

1361
01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:52.458
[hopeful music playing]

1362
01:04:54.291 --> 01:04:55.625
[imperceptible]

1363
01:05:10.166 --> 01:05:12.000
- Say hey to your coach.
- [Jack] Hey.

1364
01:05:22.875 --> 01:05:25.291
- You got-- One of these yours? Yeah?
- Uh. yeah.

1365
01:05:25.375 --> 01:05:27.916
- That's him.
- Oh. Weasel F-- Ev-- Evan!

1366
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.666
- That's him. yeah.
- Yeah. he's… Yup.

1367
01:05:33.916 --> 01:05:35.125
That's it. J-- You're good!

1368
01:05:35.208 --> 01:05:36.583
[coach] Are you ready?

1369
01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:41.000
Oh! That's it! Yep!
Yep. that's my guy! That's him.

1370
01:05:41.083 --> 01:05:42.958
- [woman] That's great.
- That's my guy.

1371
01:05:43.041 --> 01:05:44.208
[doorbell rings]

1372
01:05:45.375 --> 01:05:47.916
[panting] I thought black was best.

1373
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.291
since you are a bright winter.

1374
01:05:51.375 --> 01:05:52.791
Oh. I-- I don't need a new outfit.

1375
01:05:52.875 --> 01:05:54.250
[laughs] Aww!

1376
01:05:54.333 --> 01:05:56.458
[sighs] I feel terrible.
I'm about to tell a guy.

1377
01:05:56.541 --> 01:05:59.041
who's the most famous literary editor
in all of America.

1378
01:05:59.125 --> 01:06:02.041
that I gave him a manuscript
that he might want to publish.

1379
01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:05.125
but he possibly cannot.
And why isn't Peter calling me back?

1380
01:06:05.208 --> 01:06:07.083
If you can't reach Peter
before your date with Theo--

1381
01:06:07.166 --> 01:06:08.708
No. no. no. it's not a date.

1382
01:06:09.583 --> 01:06:11.000
- Let me have this!
- Okay.

1383
01:06:11.083 --> 01:06:13.833
I mean. I can't even stay out that late.
I have an exam tomorrow.

1384
01:06:13.916 --> 01:06:15.625
Shh. Try a dress on.

1385
01:06:15.708 --> 01:06:17.625
I'm sorry. I'm just worried
about Peter and Jack.

1386
01:06:17.708 --> 01:06:19.208
- Where are they?
- Try one on!

1387
01:06:19.291 --> 01:06:21.416
[breath trembling]

1388
01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:22.333
Please.

1389
01:06:24.041 --> 01:06:26.708
[Peter] You are by far
the fastest guy out there.

1390
01:06:26.791 --> 01:06:29.375
New nickname. Jack Frost.
'cause you own the ice!

1391
01:06:29.458 --> 01:06:30.958
- 'Sup. fellas!
- What's up. man?

1392
01:06:31.041 --> 01:06:32.708
- Great day?
- Great day. brah.

1393
01:06:33.333 --> 01:06:34.833
- Yes. I love that!
- Great day.

1394
01:06:36.333 --> 01:06:38.875
So. you ever gonna have kids?

1395
01:06:39.833 --> 01:06:41.666
What? I don't know.

1396
01:06:43.291 --> 01:06:44.250
Should I?

1397
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.833
I mean… you're not terrible at it.

1398
01:06:49.916 --> 01:06:51.750
A little weird. but you don't suck.

1399
01:06:53.958 --> 01:06:54.791
I don't?

1400
01:06:55.458 --> 01:06:56.291
No.

1401
01:06:57.166 --> 01:07:00.000
Well. I should probably start my homework.

1402
01:07:02.041 --> 01:07:02.875
See ya.

1403
01:07:05.666 --> 01:07:06.583
[chuckles softly]

1404
01:07:13.541 --> 01:07:14.708
[Peter] Oh! [sighs]

1405
01:07:15.833 --> 01:07:16.666
Hey-o.

1406
01:07:18.083 --> 01:07:18.916
Oh. for me?

1407
01:07:19.666 --> 01:07:21.416
Yeah. Come on. take a break.

1408
01:07:22.208 --> 01:07:24.291
Well. I don't-- I don't need a break.

1409
01:07:24.375 --> 01:07:25.750
I don't work here. so…

1410
01:07:25.833 --> 01:07:26.916
Yeah. I know.

1411
01:07:27.958 --> 01:07:29.166
[both chuckle]

1412
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:31.416
Oh. All right.

1413
01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:33.041
- Oh. yeah.
- All right.

1414
01:07:33.125 --> 01:07:33.958
Yeah.

1415
01:07:34.666 --> 01:07:36.583
[both breathe loudly]

1416
01:07:36.666 --> 01:07:37.500
[Peter] Mmm.

1417
01:07:37.583 --> 01:07:40.291
You know. I thought you didn't like me.

1418
01:07:40.375 --> 01:07:42.958
Why? [laughs]
Because I've been such a jerk to you?

1419
01:07:43.541 --> 01:07:44.833
Yeah. that.

1420
01:07:44.916 --> 01:07:46.708
Ah. look. I'm sorry.

1421
01:07:47.208 --> 01:07:50.458
I-- I think I've just been stressed out
being responsible for a human.

1422
01:07:50.541 --> 01:07:53.541
[chuckles] You know.
I've never even taken care of. like. a…

1423
01:07:53.625 --> 01:07:55.000
herb plant before.

1424
01:07:55.083 --> 01:07:58.125
Well. dude. herb plants
can be as hard as children.

1425
01:07:58.208 --> 01:08:02.333
Yeah. I got--
I got a sage over by the patio.

1426
01:08:02.416 --> 01:08:04.333
kept me up till 3:00 a.m. last week.

1427
01:08:04.416 --> 01:08:06.375
I call it "plant colic."

1428
01:08:06.458 --> 01:08:08.916
So. you know. I get it.

1429
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.083
Yeah. no. you get it.

1430
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.416
- Same damn thing.
- Yup.

1431
01:08:14.333 --> 01:08:19.375
Yeah. actually. I feel like
I'm. uh. doing an okay job now.

1432
01:08:19.458 --> 01:08:20.958
Ah. that's dope. brah.

1433
01:08:21.625 --> 01:08:22.458
Hmm.

1434
01:08:23.083 --> 01:08:26.833
And so I'm sorry if I wasn't
as friendly as I could have been.

1435
01:08:26.916 --> 01:08:28.625
Right? 'Cause I'm-- Hey. I. actually--

1436
01:08:28.708 --> 01:08:31.625
I think Debbie's really lucky
to have you 'round here helping out.

1437
01:08:31.708 --> 01:08:34.208
Oh. no. no. no. I'm the lucky one. okay?

1438
01:08:34.291 --> 01:08:35.625
I mean. she is…

1439
01:08:36.166 --> 01:08:37.916
[sighs and chuckles]

1440
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.750
…amazing. you know?

1441
01:08:39.833 --> 01:08:41.833
Yeah. Yeah. she really is.

1442
01:08:41.916 --> 01:08:45.375
I mean. we've been friends
for a long time.

1443
01:08:46.166 --> 01:08:48.458
I mean. not as long
as she and I have been friends. so…

1444
01:08:48.541 --> 01:08:51.041
- Oh. no. Well. of course. I'm not--
- In years.

1445
01:08:51.125 --> 01:08:52.083
Right. Look.

1446
01:08:52.791 --> 01:08:56.833
You and Debbie. you have your thing.
which is different from our thing.

1447
01:08:56.916 --> 01:09:00.041
- Your thing. Yeah.
- Right! Like. you're her friend.

1448
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.208
I'm her neighbor
and. like. part-time lover. you know?

1449
01:09:06.125 --> 01:09:07.916
- What was that?
- Oh. you know what?

1450
01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.458
You probably haven't noticed this
because you guys are just friends. but…

1451
01:09:11.958 --> 01:09:16.708
brodiddly. she is pretty hot.

1452
01:09:16.791 --> 01:09:18.083
- [chuckles]
- Yeah.

1453
01:09:18.166 --> 01:09:20.833
I mean. I know. I know.
she's out of my league. I got it.

1454
01:09:20.916 --> 01:09:22.958
But I have a plan.

1455
01:09:24.125 --> 01:09:25.708
Okay? My thing is…

1456
01:09:27.458 --> 01:09:30.208
I just keep showing up
in her life. you know?

1457
01:09:30.291 --> 01:09:34.583
And then maybe. <i>maybe.</i>
she'll change her mind about me.

1458
01:09:34.666 --> 01:09:35.916
You know what I mean?

1459
01:09:36.750 --> 01:09:40.125
In the meantime.
I'll take friends with benefits.

- Oh. isn't it amazing?
- [sighs happily]

1471
01:10:10.791 --> 01:10:12.916
It reminded me of <i>As I Lay Dying.</i>

1472
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:15.625
- Faulkner? Really?
- Mmm.

1473
01:10:15.708 --> 01:10:17.916
Yeah. I was thinking more Franzen.

1474
01:10:18.666 --> 01:10:20.750
Oh. I see that. The-- The family dynamics?

1475
01:10:20.833 --> 01:10:22.416
- Yeah. yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

1476
01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:24.958
I mean. you really--
You really found a gem.

1477
01:10:26.166 --> 01:10:27.208
I think I did.

1478
01:10:28.416 --> 01:10:30.916
The book that I have read the most
is <i>House of Mirth.</i>

1479
01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.708
Oh. Edith Wharton.
Very underrated social critic. I must say.

1480
01:10:34.791 --> 01:10:36.250
- Scathing.
- Do you like her work?

1481
01:10:36.333 --> 01:10:37.166
Of course!

1482
01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:40.375
Look. anybody who doesn't love Edie Dubs
just hasn't really read Edie Dubs.

1483
01:10:40.458 --> 01:10:44.291
[laughs] And I cry my eyes out
every time Lily Bart dies.

1484
01:10:44.375 --> 01:10:46.000
Oh. I know!
And then poor Lawrence shows up

1485
01:10:46.083 --> 01:10:48.041
the next morning to propose.
Like. buddy. come on!

1486
01:10:48.125 --> 01:10:49.250
It's just a little bit late.

01:18:58.750 --> 01:18:59.666
spent together.

1657
01:19:00.250 --> 01:19:03.000
after. I told her to stay away from me.

1658
01:19:03.083 --> 01:19:03.916
because…

1659
01:19:04.625 --> 01:19:07.000
I-- It's-- And-- And-- And then I just--

1660
01:19:07.083 --> 01:19:10.166
I found myself thinking about her.

1661
01:19:11.166 --> 01:19:12.041
A lot.

1662
01:19:12.833 --> 01:19:15.250
So I was gonna call her and see if she…

1663
01:19:17.291 --> 01:19:18.333
Whoa.

1664
01:19:18.416 --> 01:19:22.583
But a couple days later. I saw her
and Jimmy at the BevCon movie theater.

1665
01:19:22.666 --> 01:19:25.791
Oh. my God. the BevCon!
I saw every movie there.

1666
01:19:25.875 --> 01:19:28.208
I saw <i>Hunt for Red October</i>
there like eight times.

1667
01:19:28.291 --> 01:19:30.875
Yeah. anyway. the-- So. when I saw them.

1668

it-- I-- I could tell.

1669
01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:36.166
You-- So I just-- I let it go.

1670
01:19:38.083 --> 01:19:41.541
And then she comes to pick me up
from rehab. the second time.

1671
01:19:42.041 --> 01:19:45.416
And I'd done. like.
uh. therapy in there. right?

1672
01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:48.041
And so when she comes to get me.
I'm on this truth kick.

1673
01:19:48.125 --> 01:19:49.291
and I'm gonna tell her

1674
01:19:50.666 --> 01:19:51.708

1675
01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:53.333
about her.

1676
01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:57.125
So-- But she was still married.
And-- But they didn't have a kid yet.

1677
01:19:57.208 --> 01:20:00.333
And he was away a lot.
He was doing his climbing thing.

- It was cl-- climbing.

Okay. well. it looks like fishing.

1681

1683
01:20:15.250 --> 01:20:16.666

he's dated like a million women.

[Debbie] Hmm.

1825
01:27:52.833 --> 01:27:54.708
Peter hates mementos.

1826
01:27:55.375 --> 01:27:58.375
So many pictures of… you.

1827
01:27:58.458 --> 01:28:00.583
And postcards I sent him?

1828
01:28:03.416 --> 01:28:05.583
Oh. the Dodger game!

1829
01:28:06.750 --> 01:28:08.791
Oh. I-- I found that in Texas.

1830
01:28:08.875 --> 01:28:09.708
[Minka] Yeah.

1831
01:28:10.958 --> 01:28:12.041
Wait.

1832
01:28:13.708 --> 01:28:15.916
Oh. my God. He saved it too?

1833

Oh. my God.

1834
01:28:17.333 --> 01:28:21.666
This makes so much sense.
Why he couldn't fall in love with me.

1835
01:28:22.333 --> 01:28:25.041
There had to be a reason.
It couldn't be because of me.

1836

I'm the best.

1837

- [groans woozily]

1842

- I'll tell you what I think.
- Okay.

1843
01:28:40.041 --> 01:28:44.583
I think you fell in love with Peter
that first night you hooked up.

1844
01:28:45.875 --> 01:28:47.125
What? No.

1845
01:28:47.625 --> 01:28:48.500
No. no. no.

1846
01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.750
That would be reckless
and impractical. and I am not--

1847
01:28:52.833 --> 01:28:55.458
Human? We know.
That's why you freaked out about his book

1848
01:28:55.541 --> 01:28:57.333
and ran around
like a little lunatic with it?

1849
01:28:57.416 --> 01:28:58.416
No. I didn't!

Oh. my God. I did. [gasps]
Oh. my God. Yes. I did.

Because you're in love. You are.

- No. no. no. no. no.

1854

Even if I felt like Peter and I were…

1855
01:29:13.791 --> 01:29:16.625
No. no. no. He--
Peter's not interested in me like that.

1856

- Um--
- He let me know that night.

I would just…

1860
01:29:25.791 --> 01:29:29.875
No. And I would never risk
my friendship with him on the off-chance--

1861
01:29:29.958 --> 01:29:33.000
Don't you get it?
All you have to do is take a chance.

1862
01:29:33.083 --> 01:29:36.625
No. see. that's what you don't get
about me. is I don't take chances.

1863
01:29:36.708 --> 01:29:39.833
What I have is great. and-- and--
and I appreciate it. you know?

You get what you get.
and you don't get upset.

And-- And… that's how I live my life.

And-- And that is how I play poker.
I never draw into a straight.

You know what I mean?
You don't. 'cause you don't play poker.

and it has kept me safe.

1872

and I just-- I just need to be safe.

why you're not taking
into consideration how I feel about this.

I will perish.

is that I didn't get you
an interview at-- at Duncan Press.

1923

like we should see what you and I have…
