00:01:32.483 --> 00:01:34.311
You look stunning.

4
00:01:34.311 --> 00:01:37.445
I still can't believe
how fast his day's come.

5
00:01:50.022 --> 00:01:52.286
"Love is patient.

6
00:01:52.286 --> 00:01:53.374
Love is kind.

7
00:01:54.723 --> 00:01:57.291
It does not envy and
it does not boast.

8
00:01:58.248 --> 00:01:59.467
It's not proud.

9
00:02:00.381 --> 00:02:02.557
It does not dishonor others.

10
00:02:02.557 --> 00:02:03.732
It's not self-seeking.

11
00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.909
It is not easily angered.

12
00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.737
and it keeps no
record of wrongs.

13
00:02:09.955 --> 00:02:11.392
Love does not delight in evil.

14
00:02:13.002 --> 00:02:14.525
but rejoices with the truth.

15
00:02:16.745 --> 00:02:20.140
It always protects.
always trusts.

16
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.099
always hopes and
always perseveres.

17
00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:25.754
Love never fails."

18
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.242
But I failed us. Tess.

19
00:02:35.242 --> 00:02:38.419
How long have
you been writing about us?

20
00:02:42.553 --> 00:02:44.729
After we kissed.

21
00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:45.817

22
00:02:45.817 --> 00:02:48.298

We're just a bomb
waiting to explode.

25
00:02:50.866 --> 00:02:52.520
This was a wake up call.

26
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.218
You would never let me read
what you were writing in there.

27
00:02:55.218 --> 00:02:56.828
and now the whole world gets to!

28
00:02:56.828 --> 00:02:59.004
I never meant for
it to be published.

29
00:02:59.004 --> 00:03:01.616
Fuck. this never should
have happened like this.

30
00:03:01.616 --> 00:03:03.008
You accidentally wrote a book.

31
00:03:03.008 --> 00:03:04.793
and then you shopped it around

32
00:03:04.793 --> 00:03:07.535
to publishers without asking me.

33
00:03:07.535 --> 00:03:10.233
What is the point in
everything we've been through

34
00:03:10.233 --> 00:03:12.714
if we can't channel that into
something that helps people?

35
00:03:12.714 --> 00:03:14.063
It's never too late.

36
00:03:14.063 --> 00:03:15.369
People can always change.

37
00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:18.241
That is the kind of
story "After" is.

41
00:03:34.083 --> 00:03:35.693
My failure
was thinking

42
00:03:35.693 --> 00:03:39.219
that I was writing
my journey. my story.

43
00:03:41.438 --> 00:03:42.874

isn't finished.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:38.018
Stop being an
asshole to your mom.

186
00:12:39.106 --> 00:12:40.324
I'm here meeting
some board members.

187
00:12:40.324 --> 00:12:42.022
They're talking about me opening

188
00:12:42.022 --> 00:12:45.329
a London branch of
Vance Publishing.

189
00:12:45.329 --> 00:12:47.027
The ever expanding empire.

190
00:12:48.506 --> 00:12:49.812
I've heard a rumor
that you're nearly

191
00:12:49.812 --> 00:12:53.598
a year behind on delivering
your new manuscript.

192
00:12:53.598 --> 00:12:55.426
Well. don't believe
everything you hear.

193
00:12:55.426 --> 00:12:56.732
Are you lying to me?

194
00:12:57.864 --> 00:12:59.430
No. I'm not lying.

195
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.389
I was just giving you
some general life advice.

196
00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:05.523
But yeah. to be
fair. in this case.

197
00:13:05.523 --> 00:13:06.829
what you hear does
happen to be true.

198
00:13:06.829 --> 00:13:09.484
Hardin. what the fuck
is going on with you?

199
00:13:09.484 --> 00:13:11.486
We're just trying to help you.

200
00:13:11.486 --> 00:13:14.054
We can't do that if we
don't know what's going on.

201
00:13:15.533 --> 00:13:17.622
I don't really know
what's going on either.

202
00:13:17.622 --> 00:13:19.537
I keep on trying to write
and every time I do.

203
00:13:19.537 --> 00:13:22.540
everything just ends
up going back to Tessa.

204
00:13:24.107 --> 00:13:25.805
I keep rewriting the
old stuff. you know?

205
00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:27.850
The same things. what
ifs and hypotheticals

206
00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:29.199
don't really matter
in the end. do they?

207
00:13:29.199 --> 00:13:30.505
Because anyway I look at it.

208
00:13:30.505 --> 00:13:32.376
she's not here and
nothing matters

209
00:13:32.376 --> 00:13:34.030
in this world if
she's not in it.

210
00:13:35.205 --> 00:13:36.424
I don't have another book in me.

211
00:13:36.424 --> 00:13:37.381
I never did.

212
00:13:37.381 --> 00:13:38.643
I think it was all a fluke.

213
00:13:38.643 --> 00:13:40.384
And it's okay if you don't.

214
00:13:40.384 --> 00:13:41.342
You have a gift.

215
00:13:41.342 --> 00:13:42.865
All writers go through this.

216
00:13:42.865 --> 00:13:43.779
Do they?

217
00:13:44.867 --> 00:13:46.086
How the hell would. you know?

218
00:13:46.086 --> 00:13:48.001
You haven't written a
damn thing in your life.

219
00:13:49.916 --> 00:13:52.832
But I have spent my entire
career finding diamonds

220
00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:56.183
in the slush pile. and I
know talent when I see it.

221
00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:05.148
Look. let me get in
touch with Dowlish

222
00:14:05.148 --> 00:14:06.715
and see if I can do a deal.

223
00:14:06.715 --> 00:14:08.238
- No.
- Ease your deadline.

224
00:14:08.238 --> 00:14:10.414
You can come over to us and
take as long as you need.

225
00:14:10.414 --> 00:14:11.851
We've been over this.

226
00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:13.548
I don't want to.
- Hardin. if you cannot-

227
00:14:15.202 --> 00:14:16.420
Go on. just go.

228
00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:17.900
- You can't-
- Just go.

229
00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.467
You need to.

230
00:14:19.467 --> 00:14:21.861
I do have to go actually.
because you were late.

231
00:14:25.734 --> 00:14:28.215
No. no. I've
got this. I've got this.

232
00:14:29.346 --> 00:14:30.434
Waiter. I'll have another.

233
00:14:31.261 --> 00:14:32.654
I'm around. all right?

234
00:14:32.654 --> 00:14:34.221
If you need me. give me a call.

235
00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:47.495
You know. a change of scenery
might do you some good.

236
00:14:47.495 --> 00:14:49.889
might be inspiring to just
get out of here for a while.

237
00:14:52.152 --> 00:14:54.806
A bit a distance might
give you new perspective.

238
00:14:54.806 --> 00:14:58.593
might help you make peace with
your past so you can move on.

239
00:15:02.423 --> 00:15:04.642
I'm not ready to move on yet.

240
00:15:04.642 --> 00:15:08.081
No. I know. I didn't
mean in regard to...

241
00:15:11.693 --> 00:15:12.563
I meant move forward.

242
00:15:14.304 --> 00:15:15.740
Yeah. just let go of
some of your regrets

243
00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:19.527
so you can stop dragging
them into your future.

244
00:15:22.182 --> 00:15:23.531
I met Nathalie over Christmas.

245
00:15:25.489 --> 00:15:26.360
She asked after you.

246
00:15:28.231 --> 00:15:29.798
How is she?

247
00:15:29.798 --> 00:15:32.148
Well. we only spoke
for a couple of minutes.

248
00:15:32.148 --> 00:15:33.323
but she seemed good.

249
00:15:36.152 --> 00:15:37.501
She moved to Lisbon.

250
00:15:37.501 --> 00:15:38.546
- Lisbon?
- Mm.

251
00:15:39.721 --> 00:15:41.201
Portugal.

252
00:15:41.201 --> 00:15:42.419

253
00:15:42.419 --> 00:15:43.943

I was hoping to.

360
00:22:20.121 --> 00:22:22.471
I'm in the middle
of an appointment.

361
00:22:22.471 --> 00:22:23.690
You need to leave.

362
00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:25.126
I don't
need long. honestly.

363
00:22:25.126 --> 00:22:26.388
I just wanted to-
-  Please.

364
00:22:26.388 --> 00:22:28.216
I came all this
way to find you.

365
00:22:28.216 --> 00:22:29.478
Please!

366
00:22:45.842 --> 00:22:49.019
Hi.

367
00:23:41.507 --> 00:23:43.726
How you feelin'. Hardin?

368
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.860
- Pocket kings.
- Fuck!

369
00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:48.209
I'll be takin' that watch.

370
00:23:48.209 --> 00:23:49.558
Hey. man. don't
do him like that.

371
00:23:49.558 --> 00:23:50.777
His old man gave it to him.

372
00:23:50.777 --> 00:23:52.082
What? Bet's a bet.

373
00:23:52.082 --> 00:23:53.040
Yep.

374
00:23:54.215 --> 00:23:56.913
It's all right.
you'll win it back.

375
00:23:56.913 --> 00:23:58.306
I'm not stupid enough
to wager something

376
00:23:58.306 --> 00:23:59.568
I'm not willing to lose.

377
00:23:59.568 --> 00:24:01.309
Well. he didn't
have much else to bet.

378
00:24:01.309 --> 00:24:03.311
Well. then he
shouldn't have played.

379
00:24:03.311 --> 00:24:05.574
Well. I dunno what else to say.

380
00:24:08.795 --> 00:24:10.449
I'm looking for Mark.

381
00:24:12.451 --> 00:24:14.104
It's Mark Junior.

382
00:24:14.104 --> 00:24:16.237
although little guy
doesn't like that much.

383
00:24:16.237 --> 00:24:17.847
Anyway. if you're
looking for my old man.

384
00:24:17.847 --> 00:24:19.153
he's gone home for the day.

385
00:24:19.153 --> 00:24:20.589
I spoke to him on
the phone earlier

386
00:24:20.589 --> 00:24:23.636
about my car and he said
that he would take a look.

387
00:24:23.636 --> 00:24:25.464
Okay. what do you
reckon's the problem?

388
00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:29.816
The radiator.

389
00:24:31.034 --> 00:24:32.645
I really wouldn't know.

390
00:24:32.645 --> 00:24:35.212
It's making a awful
sound.

391
00:24:37.737 --> 00:24:39.260
- Oh. yeah. yeah-
- That junker looks

392
00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:40.348
older than you.

393
00:24:40.348 --> 00:24:41.523
It's hardly worth fixin'.

394
00:24:41.523 --> 00:24:42.698
Back seats look
all right. though.

395
00:24:42.698 --> 00:24:43.873
Oh. shut up. dude.

396
00:24:49.662 --> 00:24:51.577
- I'll come back.
- Yeah. you do that.

397
00:24:51.577 --> 00:24:53.274
Looking forward to it.

398
00:24:53.274 --> 00:24:54.493
See what you just did there?

399
00:24:54.493 --> 00:24:56.146
- What?
- You're a mug.

400
00:24:56.146 --> 00:24:57.539
What?

401
00:24:57.539 --> 00:24:59.498
The Virgin fuckin'
Mary over there.

402
00:24:59.498 --> 00:25:00.716
"I'll come back."

403
00:25:00.716 --> 00:25:02.239
Yeah. she would if I
showed her the goods.

404
00:25:02.239 --> 00:25:03.110
Yeah. right.

405
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:04.459
Girl like that. no way.

406
00:25:04.459 --> 00:25:05.591
Got her legs crossed real tight.

407
00:25:05.591 --> 00:25:07.114
Fuck off.

408
00:25:07.114 --> 00:25:08.637
Yeah. like you
two could get her.

409
00:25:08.637 --> 00:25:11.074
Well...

410
00:25:11.074 --> 00:25:12.815
What do you mean well?

411
00:25:12.815 --> 00:25:14.295
Well. what?

412
00:25:14.295 --> 00:25:15.905
That fucking look. all right.

413
00:25:15.905 --> 00:25:17.690
All right. I bet you this.

414
00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:18.560
One time offer.

415
00:25:19.866 --> 00:25:21.476
Let's do it.

416
00:25:21.476 --> 00:25:22.782
But I'll need proof.

417
00:26:36.812 --> 00:26:40.599
You know what would be
really sexy is if we...

418
00:26:44.559 --> 00:26:48.215
Just so I can watch it
later and think of you.

419
00:26:50.043 --> 00:26:50.957
Um...

420
00:26:52.306 --> 00:26:54.003
We don't have to.
if you don't want to.

421
00:26:54.003 --> 00:26:56.440
No. no. it's fine.

422
00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.964
I've just never...

423
00:26:59.443 --> 00:27:01.663
It would just be for you. right?

424
00:27:01.663 --> 00:27:02.795
Yeah.

425
00:27:02.795 --> 00:27:03.665
Of course.

426
00:27:05.014 --> 00:27:06.276
Okay.

427
00:27:24.033 --> 00:27:25.774
Do you have a um. um...

428
00:27:40.441 --> 00:27:42.530
I really like you.
you know. Hardin?

429
00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:43.400
Mm hm.

430
00:28:19.959 --> 00:28:20.786
- Hey.
- Hi.

431
00:28:29.882 --> 00:28:32.493
I thought you were
making amends?

432
00:28:33.712 --> 00:28:34.538
Yeah.

433
00:28:35.539 --> 00:28:37.280
Guess that depends.

434
00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:38.325
Depends on what?

435
00:28:39.326 --> 00:28:40.240
You.

436
00:28:45.114 --> 00:28:48.291
So. where are you living now?

437
00:28:48.857 --> 00:28:50.641
Camden.

438
00:28:50.641 --> 00:28:52.861
Yeah. I'm back in Camden.
- Oh. I heard that you moved.

439
00:28:52.861 --> 00:28:55.081
Yeah. I did.

440
00:28:55.081 --> 00:28:56.909
I kinda did the whole
tour of the U.S.

441
00:28:59.346 --> 00:29:00.347
But I'm back now.

442
00:29:03.785 --> 00:29:07.006
So. which one do
you like the best?

443
00:29:09.138 --> 00:29:10.139
It's gotta be this one.

444
00:29:10.139 --> 00:29:11.662
Oh. come on.

445
00:29:12.751 --> 00:29:15.275
Here. try this.

446
00:29:15.275 --> 00:29:17.320
It's a sour cherry liquor.

447
00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.061
It's Portuguese tradition.

448
00:29:19.061 --> 00:29:19.932
Go on.

449
00:29:23.936 --> 00:29:26.155
Oh. okay [laughs].

450
00:29:26.155 --> 00:29:27.069
Oh. you...

451
00:29:27.069 --> 00:29:28.027
Sorry [chuckles]. my bad.

452
00:29:28.027 --> 00:29:29.071
It's fine.

453
00:29:29.071 --> 00:29:30.116
No. it's nice.

454
00:29:30.116 --> 00:29:30.986
I like it.

455
00:29:32.379 --> 00:29:33.423
I still prefer the whiskey.

456
00:29:33.423 --> 00:29:34.729
No.

457
00:29:34.729 --> 00:29:36.862
I'm a creature
of habit. aren't I?

458
00:29:36.862 --> 00:29:37.776
Hm.

459
00:29:39.473 --> 00:29:41.997
So. how did you end up here?

460
00:29:47.002 --> 00:29:50.919
I don't know if
I'll end up here.

461
00:29:50.919 --> 00:29:55.445
Just seemed like a good
place to start over.

462
00:29:57.796 --> 00:29:59.623
You were on your
way to uni though. no?

463
00:29:59.623 --> 00:30:04.280
No. yeah. I was. but
I lost my scholarship

464
00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:05.760
with everything going on.

465
00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.197
and I didn't have time to
apply for a student loan.

466
00:30:08.197 --> 00:30:12.419
And it turns out my support
system was conditional.

467
00:30:15.726 --> 00:30:18.817
So. I picked a
place that was sunny

468
00:30:18.817 --> 00:30:23.560
and affordable where
no one knew me.

469
00:30:24.997 --> 00:30:25.954
and now here I am.

470
00:30:27.303 --> 00:30:28.827
But this part I
was not expecting.

471
00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:32.613
I did not think I
would see you again.

472
00:30:32.613 --> 00:30:35.616
much less have a
catch up over drinks.

473
00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:37.487
Sorry.

474
00:30:39.446 --> 00:30:40.273
I'm sorry.

475
00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:42.449
Okay.

476
00:30:45.147 --> 00:30:46.975
I don't really know
what else to say.

477
00:30:46.975 --> 00:30:48.194
I'm just...

478
00:30:52.067 --> 00:30:55.897
I know I fucked up and you
had to pay the consequences.

479
00:30:55.897 --> 00:30:57.856
which. I mean.

480
00:30:59.118 --> 00:31:01.076
I really fucking wish I could
just go back and then I-

481
00:31:01.076 --> 00:31:02.208
And what?

482
00:31:05.037 --> 00:31:06.125
I wouldn't...

483
00:31:13.001 --> 00:31:13.872
I'm trying.

484
00:31:14.873 --> 00:31:15.699
I am.

485
00:31:16.875 --> 00:31:19.834
I'm trying to be
a better person.

486
00:31:22.706 --> 00:31:23.533
I see.

487
00:31:26.928 --> 00:31:30.540
Right. do you want some food
to soak up all this booze?

488
00:31:31.498 --> 00:31:32.455
Yeah?

489
00:31:32.455 --> 00:31:33.369
Yeah.

490
00:31:37.156 --> 00:31:38.897
Mm. that is delicious.

491
00:31:38.897 --> 00:31:40.507
I can't believe I haven't
heard these before.

492
00:31:40.507 --> 00:31:42.248
No. this is
like the best place ever.

493
00:31:42.248 --> 00:31:43.814
And these?

494
00:31:43.814 --> 00:31:45.904
I forgot what these were
called. but these are so good.

495
00:31:46.774 --> 00:31:48.732
That is my fork.

496
00:31:52.823 --> 00:31:54.173
What?

497
00:31:54.173 --> 00:31:56.915
I'm not gonna remember that.

498
00:31:56.915 --> 00:31:59.091
Salt cod fritters.

499
00:31:59.091 --> 00:32:00.222
They're unreal.

500
00:32:00.222 --> 00:32:01.745
I mean. the whole
meal was amazing.

501
00:32:01.745 --> 00:32:03.965
Right?
I love the food here.

502
00:32:03.965 --> 00:32:05.445
I mean. everything here really.

503
00:32:05.445 --> 00:32:06.925
It's great.

504
00:32:06.925 --> 00:32:08.274
You see?

505
00:32:08.274 --> 00:32:10.276
You are in better
spirits already.

506
00:32:10.276 --> 00:32:12.539
Mm mm. I'll get this.

507
00:32:12.539 --> 00:32:14.019
- Really. are you sure?
- Definitely.

508
00:32:14.019 --> 00:32:15.150
Thank you.

509
00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:16.456
Of course.

510
00:32:16.456 --> 00:32:18.371
Oh. I didn't realize
how long we'd been here.

511
00:32:18.371 --> 00:32:19.328
I have to go.

512
00:32:20.503 --> 00:32:21.330
No worries.

513
00:32:23.332 --> 00:32:24.943
Hey. night [laughs].

514
00:32:24.943 --> 00:32:25.944
All right.

515
00:32:27.597 --> 00:32:28.511
Goodnight.

516
00:32:30.774 --> 00:32:32.341
You know. I read your book.

517
00:32:34.169 --> 00:32:36.563
So. what happened with Tessa?

518
00:32:42.351 --> 00:32:45.441
I fucked that up too. again.

519
00:32:48.227 --> 00:32:49.619
I see.

520
00:33:20.128 --> 00:33:21.173
Hardin?

521
00:33:22.217 --> 00:33:24.959
Hardin. wake up!

522
00:33:24.959 --> 00:33:26.482
Wake up!

523
00:33:26.482 --> 00:33:27.875
What have you done?

524
00:33:27.875 --> 00:33:29.050
What do you mean?

525
00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:30.356
With the video.
the video of us!

526
00:33:30.356 --> 00:33:31.922
You've sent it around.

527
00:33:31.922 --> 00:33:33.881
Why would you do this?
Why would you do this to me?

528
00:33:33.881 --> 00:33:36.144
- Wait. wait. wait.
- No. You've sent it!

529
00:33:36.144 --> 00:33:37.798
It's been posted.

530
00:33:37.798 --> 00:33:39.408
Everyone's seen it.

531
00:33:39.408 --> 00:33:41.845
Do you know what
this will do to me?

532
00:33:41.845 --> 00:33:44.718
- Fuck.
- You're a fucking liar.

533
00:33:44.718 --> 00:33:45.849
You're a disgusting liar.
- Nathalie!

534
00:33:45.849 --> 00:33:47.068
Nat!

535
00:33:47.068 --> 00:33:47.982
Disgusting.

536
00:33:50.637 --> 00:33:53.248
Fuck!

537
00:33:53.248 --> 00:33:54.206
James!

538
00:33:55.642 --> 00:33:57.426
-  Fuck me. man.
- Hey!

539
00:33:57.426 --> 00:33:59.385
Hey. you weren't kidding
about Nathalie. bro.

540
00:33:59.385 --> 00:34:01.169
Who did you send it to?

541
00:34:01.169 --> 00:34:03.084
A couple guys.

542
00:34:03.084 --> 00:34:05.043
You know. I might send
it around a little bit.

543
00:34:05.043 --> 00:34:06.435
Why are you being
weird about it?

544
00:34:06.435 --> 00:34:08.655
Why am I being weird?

545
00:34:08.655 --> 00:34:11.049
You sent around a
private fucking video.

546
00:34:11.049 --> 00:34:12.354
What the fuck is wrong with you?

547
00:34:12.354 --> 00:34:13.703
Wrong with me [laughs]?

548
00:34:13.703 --> 00:34:15.401
You're the one who
took the bet. bro.

549
00:34:15.401 --> 00:34:16.706
You fucking taped it.

550
00:34:16.706 --> 00:34:19.144
This is on you.
Hardin. not me.

551
00:34:27.108 --> 00:34:28.240
Fuck.

552
00:35:29.214 --> 00:35:30.345
Give me some of that wine.

553
00:35:30.345 --> 00:35:32.913
That wine.
- Just sayin'.

554
00:35:32.913 --> 00:35:34.523
I'm gonna be carrying
both of you home.

555
00:35:34.523 --> 00:35:36.177
Babe alert. 10 o'clock.

556
00:35:37.526 --> 00:35:39.615
I didn't think you'd make it.

557
00:35:39.615 --> 00:35:41.008
That makes two of us.

558
00:35:41.008 --> 00:35:43.184
And he comes bearing gifts.

559
00:35:43.184 --> 00:35:45.708
To whom do we owe this pleasure?

560
00:35:45.708 --> 00:35:48.407
Mads. Freya. this is Hardin.

561
00:35:48.407 --> 00:35:51.192
Hardin. Maddy. Freya.

562
00:35:51.192 --> 00:35:52.541
You can call me Madeline.

563
00:35:52.541 --> 00:35:54.282
Nice to meet you. Madeline.

564
00:35:54.282 --> 00:35:56.502
No one ever calls
you Madeline. you ham.

565
00:35:56.502 --> 00:35:59.157
My ex did once.
the French one.

566
00:36:00.027 --> 00:36:03.509
"Madeline." yum [squeals]!

567
00:36:04.988 --> 00:36:07.513
She is always like
this. by the way.

568
00:36:07.513 --> 00:36:08.905
with or without alcohol.

569
00:36:09.645 --> 00:36:10.994
So. how do you two?

570
00:36:14.259 --> 00:36:18.524
Hardin was my first crush.

571
00:36:19.873 --> 00:36:20.830
Hey.

572
00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:21.788
Was I?

573
00:36:23.224 --> 00:36:24.138
Hm.

574
00:36:24.138 --> 00:36:26.227
Just a crush. or?

575
00:36:26.227 --> 00:36:27.794
Okay. Got it.

576
00:36:28.882 --> 00:36:31.058
None of you guys are
actually from here I take it?

577
00:36:31.058 --> 00:36:32.233
Oh no. no one's from here.

578
00:36:32.233 --> 00:36:33.843
We're as close to locals
as you can get.

579
00:36:33.843 --> 00:36:35.671
All orphans.

580
00:36:35.671 --> 00:36:37.020
This is a good place to come

581
00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:38.108
when you're running
from yourself.

582
00:36:38.108 --> 00:36:39.501
- Well. that's bleak.
- Right?

583
00:36:41.677 --> 00:36:43.592
Oh God. look
what the tide dragged in.

584
00:36:43.592 --> 00:36:46.552
Why does it look like a
Dolce & Gabbana plane ad?

585
00:36:46.552 --> 00:36:48.380
I'll have a little
scratch and sniff.

586
00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:51.426
- Oh. you are officially out.
- What?

587
00:36:51.426 --> 00:36:52.297
Hey there.

588
00:36:54.081 --> 00:36:56.388
- Oh!
- Oh. God no.

589
00:36:56.388 --> 00:36:57.606
You're gettin' me all wet.

590
00:37:00.087 --> 00:37:01.480
Who's this?

591
00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:02.785
Hardin.

592
00:37:02.785 --> 00:37:06.441
Me and Nat. we grew up together.

593
00:37:06.441 --> 00:37:07.442
Hm.

594
00:37:09.749 --> 00:37:11.011
Grow up.
shake his hand.

595
00:37:15.276 --> 00:37:17.017
Well. this is Sebastian.

596
00:37:18.453 --> 00:37:20.586
Sebastian. Hardin's
in town from London.

597
00:37:20.586 --> 00:37:21.804
He's a famous author.

598
00:37:22.979 --> 00:37:24.894
- Wait. what?
- I wouldn't say famous.

599
00:37:24.894 --> 00:37:25.895
I'm just an author...

600
00:37:25.895 --> 00:37:26.809
No?

601
00:37:26.809 --> 00:37:28.333
Would you say bestselling?

602
00:37:28.333 --> 00:37:29.856
What's one of your books?

603
00:37:29.856 --> 00:37:31.640
There is only
one. but honestly-

604
00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:32.902
It's called "After."

605
00:37:32.902 --> 00:37:34.295
No way I've heard of that.

606
00:37:34.295 --> 00:37:35.296
I've read that.

607
00:37:35.296 --> 00:37:36.254
No. you haven't.

608
00:37:36.254 --> 00:37:37.516
I loved it.

609
00:37:37.516 --> 00:37:38.865
Well. as much as you
can love something

610
00:37:38.865 --> 00:37:41.128
that makes you ugly
cry every other page.

611
00:37:41.128 --> 00:37:42.695
I heard
they're making a movie?

612
00:37:42.695 --> 00:37:43.826
Oh. Harry Style should play you.

613
00:37:43.826 --> 00:37:45.088
Thank you.

614
00:37:45.088 --> 00:37:47.265
So. you're
working on anything now?

615
00:37:48.353 --> 00:37:49.484
I'm trying. yeah.

616
00:37:49.484 --> 00:37:50.746
What is it they say?

617
00:37:52.008 --> 00:37:54.228
Everyone has one book in them.

618
00:37:54.228 --> 00:37:56.578
only the talented have a second.

619
00:37:56.578 --> 00:37:58.232
Huh. wow.

620
00:37:58.232 --> 00:37:59.755
Spoken like a true writer.

621
00:37:59.755 --> 00:38:01.540
Tell me. where can I
find your body of work?

622
00:38:03.672 --> 00:38:05.935
- The boy can keep up.
- Mm hm.

623
00:38:05.935 --> 00:38:07.676
You ever been
cliff diving. man?

624
00:38:07.676 --> 00:38:09.025
No. I'm putting my foot down.

625
00:38:09.025 --> 00:38:10.592
You are not roping
him into that.

626
00:38:10.592 --> 00:38:12.072
What? It's fun.

627
00:38:12.072 --> 00:38:13.987
It's an accident
waiting to happen.

628
00:38:13.987 --> 00:38:14.857
Come on. man.

629
00:38:17.512 --> 00:38:18.731
Let's do it.

630
00:38:41.101 --> 00:38:42.711
This is a bad idea.

631
00:38:42.711 --> 00:38:45.540
Seriously Hardin. don't
let him pressure you. okay?

632
00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:48.456
Yeah man. don't
let me pressure you.

633
00:38:53.331 --> 00:38:54.506
Woo!

634
00:38:54.506 --> 00:38:55.594
Let's go!

635
00:38:57.378 --> 00:38:59.641
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

636
00:38:59.641 --> 00:39:01.774
Hardin?

637
00:39:01.774 --> 00:39:03.166
Come up.

638
00:39:13.612 --> 00:39:15.396
Just fuckin' with you.

639
00:40:40.916 --> 00:40:42.048
Hardin. hey.

640
00:40:46.792 --> 00:40:49.229
You okay?

641
00:40:49.229 --> 00:40:50.099
Yeah.

642
00:40:52.667 --> 00:40:54.060
Yeah. I will be.

643
00:41:57.253 --> 00:42:01.301
Me and Nat. we uh.
we grew up together.

644
00:42:10.571 --> 00:42:13.705
Hardin
was my first crush.

645
00:43:43.882 --> 00:43:45.666
Hey.

646
00:43:45.666 --> 00:43:48.495
Not much of a
morning person. are we?

647
00:43:48.495 --> 00:43:50.236
Just haven't had
enough coffee yet.

648
00:43:51.803 --> 00:43:54.283
And I am definitely not a
smoothie person. but thank you.

649
00:43:54.283 --> 00:43:56.285
How can you hate smoothies?

650
00:43:56.285 --> 00:43:58.070
It's literally blended
fruit and a bit of veg.

651
00:43:58.070 --> 00:44:01.247
It's more about the
aesthetic. isn't it?

652
00:44:01.247 --> 00:44:03.771
It's like a holier than thou
wellness cult kinda thing.

653
00:44:09.081 --> 00:44:10.822
Come on. just try it.

654
00:44:12.432 --> 00:44:13.259
Come on.

655
00:44:20.483 --> 00:44:22.050
Mm. yeah.

656
00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:23.835
Maybe you don't know what
kind of person you are.

657
00:44:44.725 --> 00:44:45.813
Can you do me a favor?

658
00:44:45.813 --> 00:44:47.032
Can you pull in the main sheet?

659
00:44:48.729 --> 00:44:50.122
Pull...

660
00:44:50.122 --> 00:44:51.123
What's the main sheet?

661
00:44:51.123 --> 00:44:52.428
Sorry. the red one.

662
00:44:52.428 --> 00:44:53.473
Pull the red line.

663
00:44:55.257 --> 00:44:56.911
- I just pull it?
- Yes.

664
00:45:00.132 --> 00:45:01.829
- This okay?
- Yes.

665
00:45:01.829 --> 00:45:03.396
Good.

666
00:45:12.622 --> 00:45:14.320
Here.

667
00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:15.538
You look like you need water.

668
00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:18.367
Thanks.

669
00:45:23.546 --> 00:45:26.898
I've been stuck in my
apartment for so long.

670
00:45:26.898 --> 00:45:28.334
Figure it's taken a toll.

671
00:45:29.552 --> 00:45:30.379
Stuck?

672
00:45:32.338 --> 00:45:33.905
More like
self-contained. I guess.

673
00:45:35.167 --> 00:45:36.864
Figured if I shut myself
away from the world

674
00:45:36.864 --> 00:45:40.215
for long enough eventually
I'd find the words.

675
00:45:40.215 --> 00:45:42.304
You do like to pick
things apart. don't you?

676
00:45:42.304 --> 00:45:43.523
Oh. yeah.

677
00:45:43.523 --> 00:45:45.351
That's how you get
to the good stuff.

678
00:45:46.831 --> 00:45:48.920
So why do you think
you're struggling so much?

679
00:45:50.443 --> 00:45:52.140
Second novel syndrome.

680
00:45:53.838 --> 00:45:55.361
I mean. it's common
enough to have a name

681
00:45:55.361 --> 00:45:57.058
so at least I'm
not the only one.

682
00:45:58.407 --> 00:46:00.366
But I guess there must
be a number of reasons.

683
00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:03.804
Like?

684
00:46:03.804 --> 00:46:05.153
Picking things apart again?

685
00:46:05.153 --> 00:46:06.111
Oh. yeah.

686
00:46:08.156 --> 00:46:09.375
Well. "After" was easy.

687
00:46:11.246 --> 00:46:12.334
I had my muse.

688
00:46:12.334 --> 00:46:13.640
I was inspired.

689
00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:15.424
I could have written
thousands of pages.

690
00:46:16.991 --> 00:46:18.732
It's kind of the irony
of it all. isn't it?

691
00:46:18.732 --> 00:46:21.169
If I didn't have her. I
wouldn't have the book.

692
00:46:21.169 --> 00:46:24.825
but if I didn't have the book.
then I would still have her.

693
00:46:25.565 --> 00:46:27.393
Oh. she didn't like the book?

694
00:46:27.393 --> 00:46:30.526
She absolutely
fucking hated the book.

695
00:46:30.526 --> 00:46:32.398
The parts that she read. anyway.

696
00:46:32.398 --> 00:46:33.834
It was more about
the circumstances

697
00:46:33.834 --> 00:46:35.923
of how she read
them as well. but-

698
00:46:35.923 --> 00:46:38.839
Wait. you didn't ask her
permission to write it?

699
00:46:38.839 --> 00:46:42.364
I really thought that sharing
our story would help people

700
00:46:42.364 --> 00:46:44.149
the same way that it helped me

701
00:46:44.149 --> 00:46:45.933
to get through my shit
and figure things out.

702
00:46:45.933 --> 00:46:49.241
but obviously I now understand
that I shouldn't have gone

703
00:46:49.241 --> 00:46:51.025
and published it to the
entire fucking world

704
00:46:51.025 --> 00:46:52.810
without telling her.
I know that now.

705
00:46:54.507 --> 00:46:58.250
I mean. it's not nice being
exposed without your consent.

706
00:47:18.966 --> 00:47:19.837
Do you see that?

707
00:47:21.229 --> 00:47:22.100
There?

708
00:47:23.928 --> 00:47:25.451
That is my dream.

709
00:47:29.672 --> 00:47:31.892
I think I would wake
up every morning

710
00:47:31.892 --> 00:47:34.460
with the biggest smile on
my face if that was my view.

711
00:47:37.202 --> 00:47:38.072
Seems lonely.

712
00:47:40.945 --> 00:47:45.601
Nah. not if you have the
right person share it with.

713
00:48:00.094 --> 00:48:02.618
I don't want to lose this.

714
00:48:02.618 --> 00:48:04.055
I don't either.

715
00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.847
So. are you ever gonna show me

716
00:48:13.847 --> 00:48:14.848
what you're writing in there?

717
00:48:14.848 --> 00:48:15.893
I...

718
00:48:15.893 --> 00:48:17.895
Maybe. someday.

719
00:48:20.506 --> 00:48:21.333
Someday.

720
00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:37.479

820
00:55:17.531 --> 00:55:19.141
I came here in the first place

821
00:55:19.141 --> 00:55:22.493
to try and resolve my past
so I can move forward.

822
00:55:22.493 --> 00:55:23.668
I am fucking trying.

823
00:55:35.375 --> 00:55:36.898
Maybe I need to try harder.

824
00:55:39.988 --> 00:55:42.687

825
00:55:42.687 --> 00:55:43.644
Has she?

826
00:55:43.644 --> 00:55:45.211
She says so.

827
00:55:45.211 --> 00:55:46.517
So. you've talked to her?

828
00:55:49.258 --> 00:55:50.695
It's mostly been one-sided.

829
00:55:52.218 --> 00:55:53.872
She replied to the
last message saying.

830
00:55:53.872 --> 00:55:56.135
"You should move
on. 'cause I have."

831
00:55:57.789 --> 00:55:59.530
I know you are gonna say.
I'm being irrational when...

832
00:55:59.530 --> 00:56:03.360
And I should just let
go but I genuinely.

833
00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:05.753
I cannot comprehend the
thought of giving up on us.

834
00:56:05.753 --> 00:56:07.712
It doesn't make sense to me.

835
00:56:07.712 --> 00:56:08.974
Maybe you don't have to.

836
00:56:11.411 --> 00:56:13.631
Maybe you can hold a space
for her in your heart

837
00:56:13.631 --> 00:56:15.197
like I hold a
space for your mom.

838
00:56:16.764 --> 00:56:18.287
Always.

839
00:56:18.287 --> 00:56:19.767
It doesn't mean
that you can't go on

840
00:56:19.767 --> 00:56:21.378
to have other great loves.

841
00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:23.815
and live a full life.

842
00:56:26.818 --> 00:56:28.167
I don't know.

843
00:56:28.167 --> 00:56:32.606
Well. take it from
someone who does.

844
00:56:37.481 --> 00:56:42.399
It's easy to believe that our
ability to love is finite.

845
00:56:44.009 --> 00:56:46.011
especially when your
heart is broken.

846
00:56:47.447 --> 00:56:51.582
But believe it or not.
slowly you will heal.

847
00:56:53.888 --> 00:56:58.327
And your capacity for love
will grow exponentially.

848
00:56:58.327 --> 00:57:01.069
You'll be able to keep a
space for Tessa in your heart.

849
00:57:01.069 --> 00:57:03.898
for your family. for
your future children.

850
00:57:03.898 --> 00:57:05.596
for anybody who
comes into your life.

851
00:57:06.814 --> 00:57:08.120
And you never know.

852
00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:11.036
maybe you and Tessa are
meant to be together.

853
00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:13.473
And if that is the case.

854
00:57:13.473 --> 00:57:15.214
then you will find your
way back to each other.

855
00:57:15.214 --> 00:57:17.477
but it's not gonna
happen like this is it?

856
00:57:17.477 --> 00:57:18.391
Look at you.

857
00:57:19.827 --> 00:57:21.699
You go on drinking and
messing up the way you are.

858
00:57:26.443 --> 00:57:27.269
You're right.

859
00:57:29.924 --> 00:57:32.013
You are. of course you're right.

860
00:57:32.013 --> 00:57:35.277
You know. my life was
finally getting somewhere.

861
00:57:35.277 --> 00:57:37.976
You know. with the book I
actually finally did something.

862
00:57:37.976 --> 00:57:39.238
something I was proud of.

863
00:57:41.153 --> 00:57:42.850
And then. yeah. I mean.

864
00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:45.157
I guess it fucked up and
everything blew up in my face.

865
00:57:45.157 --> 00:57:46.680
And now the bar's
so fucking high.

866
00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:48.073
I'll never get back there again.

867
00:57:49.074 --> 00:57:50.467
I'm so scared of failing.

868
00:57:52.381 --> 00:57:54.471
so I just end up ruining
everything instead.

869
00:57:59.867 --> 00:58:00.912
It's pathetic.

870
00:58:00.912 --> 00:58:01.956
You're right.
- Listen to me.

871
00:58:01.956 --> 00:58:02.957
It's fucking pathetic.

872
00:58:02.957 --> 00:58:04.611
isn't it?
- Listen.

873
00:58:04.611 --> 00:58:09.181
You need to change the metrics
by which you define success.

874
00:58:09.181 --> 00:58:13.533
You can start by
writing one page a day.

875
00:58:13.533 --> 00:58:16.188
Just that. and that'll
be your success.

876
00:58:16.188 --> 00:58:18.059
And if your second book
comes out and it flunks.

877
00:58:18.059 --> 00:58:21.019
but you've been
real and authentic.

878
00:58:21.019 --> 00:58:22.107
then that is a success.

879
00:58:24.588 --> 00:58:28.679
Whether you end up with a
woman you have loved or not.

880
00:58:28.679 --> 00:58:31.638
you have loved with
every cell in your being.

881
00:58:31.638 --> 00:58:34.511
and that in and of itself
is a spectacular success.

882
00:58:40.604 --> 00:58:41.430
Wow.

883
00:58:43.955 --> 00:58:45.652
You're not bad at
this Dad stuff.

884
00:58:47.959 --> 00:58:50.918
Now that for me is
the pinnacle of success.

885
00:58:53.704 --> 00:58:54.705
So. what are you gonna do?

886
00:58:57.272 --> 00:59:00.537
Could book a return flight
with me if you want.

887
00:59:02.016 --> 00:59:02.930
No.

888
00:59:07.369 --> 00:59:08.196

889
00:59:09.458 --> 00:59:11.112
I'm gonna stay here for awhile.

890
00:59:11.112 --> 00:59:14.376

through and try to write.

01:01:05.879 --> 01:01:08.621
It's just.
I rang the doorbell

900
01:01:08.621 --> 01:01:09.927
and you weren't on WhatsApp

901
01:01:09.927 --> 01:01:11.450
and I just wanted to
see if you're okay.

902
01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:12.799
I'm fine.

903
01:01:12.799 --> 01:01:14.540
Should we sit?
- Yes.

904
01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:17.064
I brought you a
little care package.

905
01:01:17.064 --> 01:01:19.676
I didn't think that you'd
be in a state to go out. so.

906
01:01:21.329 --> 01:01:23.636
This is ridiculously generous.

907
01:01:26.204 --> 01:01:28.902
I should probably tell you
that I've stopped drinking.

908
01:01:28.902 --> 01:01:30.512
- No.
- Yeah [chuckles].

909
01:01:30.512 --> 01:01:32.036
- I'm sorry. that's bad.
- It would've

910
01:01:32.036 --> 01:01:33.298
been very thoughtful.

911
01:01:34.473 --> 01:01:35.648
I'll have the chocolate.

912
01:01:38.607 --> 01:01:41.698
Oh. Seb is an asshole for
attacking you like that.

913
01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:42.655
I'm so sorry.

914
01:01:42.655 --> 01:01:43.787
He had his reasons.

915
01:01:43.787 --> 01:01:45.310
I really do wish
there was something

916
01:01:45.310 --> 01:01:46.920
I could do to make it up to you.

917
01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:51.751
Hardin. your apology.
spending this time together.

918
01:01:51.751 --> 01:01:53.666
seeing that you've changed.
that all means something.

919
01:01:53.666 --> 01:01:56.451
You didn't force me
to do anything.

920
01:01:56.451 --> 01:01:59.672
No. but I lied to you. Nat.

921
01:02:03.328 --> 01:02:05.939
I didn't see it then.
but I do see it now.

922
01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:09.247
So. I'm sorry.

923
01:02:12.206 --> 01:02:13.120
Oh. sorry.

924
01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:14.078
Does that hurt still?

925
01:02:14.078 --> 01:02:15.079
Oh. okay. sorry.

926
01:02:15.079 --> 01:02:16.080
It does hurt.

927
01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:17.342
- It's fine.
- I'm sorry.

928
01:02:17.342 --> 01:02:18.909
Okay?
- Yeah.

929
01:02:18.909 --> 01:02:24.088
Oh. no.

930
01:02:27.352 --> 01:02:29.528
I'm sorry.
- No. it's fine.

931
01:02:31.399 --> 01:02:32.574
I'm still in love with Tessa.

932
01:02:34.054 --> 01:02:38.363
I know she may have
moved on. but I haven't.

933
01:02:39.843 --> 01:02:42.628
I do want you to know
how grateful I am though.

934
01:02:42.628 --> 01:02:46.153
for really giving me the chance
to put what I did behind us.

935
01:02:47.154 --> 01:02:48.416
I think it takes
a lot of bravery

936
01:02:48.416 --> 01:02:52.638
to be so forgiving.
so thank you.

937
01:02:52.638 --> 01:02:55.554
You really deserve someone who
can give you all of themself.

938
01:02:56.816 --> 01:02:57.861
You really do.

939
01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:00.515
You're right. I do.

940
01:03:04.432 --> 01:03:05.651
You do.

941
01:03:07.435 --> 01:03:09.089
I think you should take
this wine back. though.

942
01:03:09.089 --> 01:03:10.177
I do.

943
01:03:10.177 --> 01:03:11.570
Let's not waste it.

944
01:03:11.570 --> 01:03:12.832
It does look
very nice. though.

945
01:03:15.095 --> 01:03:16.575
Yeah. I'll enjoy
that by myself.

946
01:03:16.575 --> 01:03:17.924
Please do.

947
01:03:22.233 --> 01:03:23.408
Hey. it's Landon.

948
01:03:23.408 --> 01:03:24.844
Leave a message.

949
01:03:26.541 --> 01:03:27.804
Shit.

950
01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:28.979
Sorry. Landon. I didn't realize

951
01:03:28.979 --> 01:03:31.024
what time it was over there.
I just...

952
01:03:31.024 --> 01:03:32.634
Just calling to say congratulations.

953
01:03:34.288 --> 01:03:36.203
Wouldn't miss my brother's
wedding for the world.

954

Keep the change.

976
01:05:47.378 --> 01:05:48.727
They all look beautiful.

977
01:05:48.727 --> 01:05:50.163
They all suit you
but I just think

978
01:05:50.163 --> 01:05:52.687
that the second one is very you.

979
01:05:53.993 --> 01:05:57.127
- Yes.
- It fits you perfectly.

980
01:05:57.127 --> 01:05:58.998
But there's a couple
more over here

981
01:05:58.998 --> 01:06:01.000
if you wanna just have a look.
- Okay.

982
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.132
Hey.

983
01:06:02.132 --> 01:06:03.568
Hey.

984
01:06:05.048 --> 01:06:07.137
So. is this goodbye?

985
01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:09.574
I fly tomorrow.

986
01:06:11.184 --> 01:06:12.620
I just came back
to give you this.

987
01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:19.584
It's still very much
a work in progress.

988
01:06:19.584 --> 01:06:21.194
I haven't sent it
to my editor yet

989
01:06:21.194 --> 01:06:22.717
or anything like that. so.

990
01:06:22.717 --> 01:06:24.632
Don't worry.
I'm sure it's brilliant.

991
01:06:25.372 --> 01:06:27.548
And if it isn't I'll just
pretend it is [smirks].

992
01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:31.813
It's just [sighs].

993
01:06:36.383 --> 01:06:37.558
you're in it.

994
01:06:39.865 --> 01:06:41.475
and I just wanna make sure
that you're entirely okay

995
01:06:41.475 --> 01:06:43.869
with everything in
there before I send it

996
01:06:43.869 --> 01:06:46.002
to my publisher or anyone
else [inhales shakily].

997
01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:49.788
Oh. so you want my permission?

998
01:06:52.225 --> 01:06:54.401
I guess I'm trying

999
01:06:54.401 --> 01:06:55.620
to learn from my old mistakes.

1000
01:06:58.710 --> 01:07:00.364
Well. I look
forward to reading it.

1001
01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:07.632
Have a safe flight. okay?

1002
01:07:15.205 --> 01:07:16.858
Bye. Nathalie.

1003
01:10:41.672 --> 01:10:43.456
You see that?

1004
01:10:43.456 --> 01:10:44.805
That is my dream.

1005
01:11:19.710 --> 01:11:21.320
You look stunning.

1006
01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:23.844
Such a beautiful bride.

1007
01:11:23.844 --> 01:11:26.151
I still can't believe
how fast this days come.

1008
01:11:27.935 --> 01:11:29.459
What if
he doesn't show up?

1009
01:11:30.982 --> 01:11:32.679
Ken drove him
here this morning.

1010
01:11:32.679 --> 01:11:34.464
He would've alerted us
if there was a concern.

1011
01:11:34.464 --> 01:11:36.292
And it's
Landon. he would never.

1012
01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:40.470
Hope I'm not intruding.

1013
01:11:41.471 --> 01:11:42.994
Thanks.

1014
01:11:42.994 --> 01:11:45.997
Also. the caterer's
havin' a minor meltdown.

1015
01:11:45.997 --> 01:11:47.738
Can you tell her
I'll be a minute?

1016
01:11:48.391 --> 01:11:49.348
I can try.

1017
01:11:50.871 --> 01:11:52.351
Okay.

1018
01:11:52.351 --> 01:11:55.049
I am sure Landon is just
as nervous as you are.

1019
01:11:55.049 --> 01:11:57.487
but between Ken and Hardin-

1020
01:11:57.487 --> 01:11:59.097
Oh. if Hardin's helping

1021
01:11:59.097 --> 01:12:00.577
I should just cancel
the honeymoon now.

1022
01:12:03.536 --> 01:12:05.756
You know. if he wasn't
Landon's brother.

1023
01:12:05.756 --> 01:12:08.324
he wouldn't have been invited.
much less the best man.

1024
01:12:09.803 --> 01:12:12.197
I'm gonna go check on things.

1025
01:12:15.374 --> 01:12:17.942
So what's it been. two
years since you've seen him?

1026
01:12:19.813 --> 01:12:21.772
25 months. but who's counting?

1027
01:12:24.165 --> 01:12:25.515
Hey. Tess?

1028
01:12:25.515 --> 01:12:27.908
- Yeah. okay. coming.
- Okay.

1029
01:12:30.911 --> 01:12:32.478
You
ready. Mrs. Gibson?

1030
01:12:33.827 --> 01:12:38.528
No. but I will be
as soon as I see him.

1031
01:12:39.398 --> 01:12:40.356
Are you?

1032
01:12:41.966 --> 01:12:46.971
Yeah. of course.

1033
01:12:54.805 --> 01:12:56.459
Last chance to bail.

1034
01:12:56.459 --> 01:12:58.330
Me. bail?

1035
01:12:58.330 --> 01:13:00.898
You're the one who's
nervous about seeing her.

1036
01:13:01.638 --> 01:13:02.595
I'm not nervous.

1037
01:13:03.379 --> 01:13:04.380
I'm fine.

1038
01:13:05.598 --> 01:13:07.208
You're fine?

1039
01:13:07.208 --> 01:13:09.297
She's the maid of honor.
I figured she'd show.

1040
01:13:09.297 --> 01:13:11.125
Okay. hot stuff.

1041
01:13:11.125 --> 01:13:12.344
Go talk to her.

1042
01:13:53.211 --> 01:13:56.780
You really do have
an eye for this stuff.

1043
01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:57.737
Thank you.

1044
01:15:33.398 --> 01:15:34.530
There he is.

1045
01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:35.748
Hey.

1046
01:15:35.748 --> 01:15:36.923
Hey.

1047
01:15:36.923 --> 01:15:38.142
You all right?

1048
01:15:38.142 --> 01:15:40.057
Yeah. I'm fine.

1049
01:15:47.934 --> 01:15:49.370
Tell him.

1050
01:15:49.370 --> 01:15:51.547
I am enjoying this
way too much to put him

1051
01:15:51.547 --> 01:15:52.417
out of his misery.

1052
01:15:52.417 --> 01:15:53.766
Have mercy.

1053
01:15:53.766 --> 01:15:54.724
Enjoying what?

1054
01:15:56.029 --> 01:15:56.943
What?

1055
01:15:57.944 --> 01:15:59.163
They're not together.

1056
01:16:01.165 --> 01:16:02.601
Landon said
they're inseparable.

1057
01:16:02.601 --> 01:16:05.169
Yeah. like brother and sister.

1058
01:16:08.433 --> 01:16:10.130
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. no. no-

1059
01:16:10.130 --> 01:16:12.176
He's dating a
literal neuroscientist

1060
01:16:12.176 --> 01:16:14.352
and apparently they're already
talking about marriage.

1061
01:16:14.352 --> 01:16:15.658
so yes. I am sure.

1062
01:16:34.677 --> 01:16:36.330
Hey.

1063
01:16:36.330 --> 01:16:38.245
I need a favor.

1064
01:16:43.903 --> 01:16:45.252
Tessa. wanna go dance?

1065
01:16:46.993 --> 01:16:48.255
- Yeah.
- Yes. she does.

1066
01:16:48.255 --> 01:16:49.082
Yeah. sure.

- Hey.

1073
01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:17.241
He's a bit short.

1074
01:17:18.677 --> 01:17:20.070
Terrible dancer. too.

1075
01:17:23.943 --> 01:17:25.466

Landon would go from being
the smartest guy in the room

1115
01:19:53.353 --> 01:19:55.268
to being a blithering idiot

1116

who just couldn't string
sentences together.

1117
01:19:58.576 --> 01:19:59.446
But he found his way.

1118
01:20:00.970 --> 01:20:03.494

were both head over heels.
