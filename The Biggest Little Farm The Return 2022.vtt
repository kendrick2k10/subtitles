3
00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:25.692
- I'm gonna tell you about this place

4
00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:30.905
that ten years ago didn't even exist.

5
00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:40.373
What created this wasn't brilliance.

6
00:00:41.332 --> 00:00:42.834
or experience...

7
00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:47.255
it was... freedom.

8
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.506
- We didn't put the frames in?

9
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.468
- Yeah. we didn't put the frames
and there was just a... empty box.

10
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.471
- So the bees can just
kind of do whatever they want?

11
00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:55.597
- Yeah.

12
00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:57.515
- To allow nature...

13
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:58.767
-- Wow!
-- Oh. wow!

14
00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:02.854
- They really free formed it.

15
00:01:03.104 --> 00:01:04.064
- That's art.

16
00:01:04.856 --> 00:01:08.026
- ...to show us a better way.

17
00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:14.449
And it's not just a way of farming.

18
00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:17.911
It's a way of seeing.

19
00:01:28.546 --> 00:01:30.465
- That's exactly how my wife.

20
00:01:30.548 --> 00:01:34.552
Molly. and I rebuilt
this whole farm over the last decade.

21
00:01:42.227 --> 00:01:45.730
- And it all started... with a dream.

22
00:01:53.321 --> 00:01:54.948
-- The apple orchard could go here.
-- Yeah.

23
00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:56.783
- And we need a lot
of different kinds of chickens.

24
00:01:57.033 --> 00:01:58.409
-- Mm-hmm.
-- We need to find a spot

25
00:01:58.493 --> 00:01:59.410
for cherimoya.

26
00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:01.454
-- Yeah.
-- And over there. I saw a perfect

27
00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:02.914
-spot for a garden.
-- Uh-huh.

28
00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:05.083
- I wonder if we can grow bananas.

29
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.376
- Oh. my God!

30
00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:11.714
- So we have some wild fennel
down here that's flowering...

31
00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:14.592
- When Molly and I arrived
on what was an old.

32
00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:18.429
industrial lemon farm. we had big ideas.

33
00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:20.140
- Snake!

34
00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:23.268
Oh. my gosh! That scared me.

35
00:02:23.893 --> 00:02:25.645
And now the shoe is close to the snake...

36
00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:27.730
- And no prior farming experience.

37
00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:29.440
- ...which is a bit of a conundrum.

38
00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:32.110
- Why are you so mean?

39
00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.237
- Woah!

40
00:02:34.737 --> 00:02:36.322
- Here we are.

41
00:02:37.073 --> 00:02:39.409
Apricot Lane farms.

42
00:02:40.034 --> 00:02:43.037
- We wanted to grow
the best-tasting food...

43
00:02:44.873 --> 00:02:48.543
but doing it in a way
that regenerated the land

44
00:02:49.043 --> 00:02:51.462
while working in harmony with nature.

45
00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:55.884
But our soil seemed dead.

46
00:02:56.467 --> 00:02:57.635
This is what we're fighting.

47
00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:01.556
It doesn't smash.

48
00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:03.183
- So were the plants.

49
00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:05.768
- Molly. look. it's a beehive.

50
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.688
They're all dead.

51
00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:10.190
- Oh.

52
00:03:11.065 --> 00:03:14.736
- In order to reawaken
the ecosystem of our land.

53
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.991
we had to create the highest level
of biodiversity possible.

54
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:24.245
It's the variety of living-organisms...

55
00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:28.374
...that rebuild life.

56
00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:31.502
- Oh. my goodness!

57
00:03:31.794 --> 00:03:35.048
- We brought in every animal you'd see
in a children's book.

58
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.759
- One hundred baby ducks.

59
00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:48.353
- Their poop is our gold.

60
00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:54.192
The animals. along with the composting

61
00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:56.736
and adding cover crops.

62
00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:00.448
all share the same goal.

63
00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:04.827
- To bring our soil back to life.

64
00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:09.624
infusing it with important microorganisms.

65
00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:13.503
We even restored native habitats

66
00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:16.798
to encourage the return
of beneficial wildlife.

67
00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:23.346
By year five. we had created
one of the most diverse farms

68
00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:25.014
in southern California.

69
00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:31.062
growing over 160 different things.

70
00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:37.527
But. you know. the real indicator
that we had done something special

71
00:04:38.736 --> 00:04:40.029
was the soil.

72
00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:51.457
The quality of the food we eat
starts with the soil it was grown in.

73
00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:02.302
Or even raised on.

74
00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:11.144
- It looks like starlings.

75
00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:14.188
- Yeah. that's what I think. too.

76
00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:20.028
- I'm making it sound easy.
but it wasn't.

77
00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:24.324
The birds attacked our orchards.

78
00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.909
- We lost almost 70 percent
of the fruit.

79
00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:28.536
- Oh. my gosh.

80
00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:31.247
- Snails smothered our trees.

81
00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.249
-- We can't put poison out.
-- Nope.

82
00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:35.668
Our ducks polluted our pond.

83
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.005
Coyotes killed our chickens.

84
00:05:39.797 --> 00:05:42.133
We're missing. like. 230 birds.

85
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.635
- Gophers pilfered our orchards.

86
00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:46.804
- You've never seen it
this bad before?

87
00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:48.014
- Never.

88
00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:50.183
The gophers are killing the trees.

89
00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:55.480
- And who could forget
the record-breaking droughts.

90
00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:58.232
winds. and fires?

91
00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:01.986
- John. there's an electric wire.
be careful.

92
00:06:02.111 --> 00:06:03.488
John. we're gonna go.

93
00:06:03.571 --> 00:06:04.989
-- I want my toys!
-- It's okay.

94
00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:11.287
- But then. something happened.

95
00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:16.959
The solutions to our problems
began to appear

96
00:06:17.293 --> 00:06:20.546
within the diversity that we had created.

97
00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:26.552
Hawks returned
to chase away the starlings.

98
00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:29.847
Guardian dogs protected the chickens...

99
00:06:32.141 --> 00:06:36.396
which helped the coyotes focus
on another problem we were facing...

100
00:06:37.855 --> 00:06:38.856
gophers.

101
00:06:39.732 --> 00:06:41.442
And what they didn't eat...

102
00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:47.865
- ...the barn owls. hawks. weasels.
badgers. and gopher snakes did.

103
00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:53.079
Oh. and as for that snail problem...

104
00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:09.887
- In just one season.

105
00:07:10.721 --> 00:07:13.808
our ducks ate over 96.000 snails.

106
00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:20.815
turning the snails
into nitrogen-rich duck poop.

107
00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:26.821
fertilizing our trees
and our cover crops...

108
00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:30.741
which we then grazed with our sheep.

109
00:07:31.075 --> 00:07:35.872
adding yet another layer of fertility
to regenerate our soils.

110
00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:42.962
And even today as we look back.

111
00:07:43.754 --> 00:07:47.717
it's hard to believe
the transformation of this land

112
00:07:48.217 --> 00:07:50.553
unless you see it in person.

113
00:07:51.345 --> 00:07:54.432
- Hey. everybody.
welcome to Apricot Lane farms.

114
00:07:54.682 --> 00:07:56.392
-- Who came from the furthest?
-- Hong Kong.

115
00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:57.935
-- Hong Kong?
-- India.

116
00:07:58.019 --> 00:07:58.978
-- India?
-- China.

117
00:07:59.353 --> 00:08:00.897
-- Texas.
-- Texas?

118
00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:03.983
-That is almost another country.
-- Yes. it is.

119
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.402
So. we're standing right in the middle
of the fruit basket.

120
00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:08.362
We have the mandarins on our left

121
00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:11.824
and these are various varieties
of oranges.

122
00:08:19.957 --> 00:08:21.918
- And I think it's important
to keep in mind

123
00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:23.878
that everything you're seeing out here

124
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.423
came from the work
that we did to rebuild our soil.

125
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.968
And when you're focused on the soil.

126
00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:34.388
you're growing food in a way
that would maximize nutrient-density.

127
00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:39.310
So. it actually becomes the most
delicious food that you can possibly eat.

128
00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:45.775
- Since the farm has hit
that benchmark ten-year existence.

129
00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:48.653
have you guys experienced any surprises
or things you didn't expect

130
00:08:48.736 --> 00:08:50.279
after hitting that. that point?

131
00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:58.746
I think one of the... the difficult things
that we're facing now is. more...

132
00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:02.959
The fact that we have a lot
of favorite animals that are now aging

133
00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:06.003
and Mo says he's not one of them.

134
00:09:07.129 --> 00:09:09.924
And figuring out what to do
with some of those animals.

135
00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:30.319
And while we do raise animals as food.
they're also some family favorites.

136
00:09:30.653 --> 00:09:32.572
Mo. let go.

137
00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:37.159
- So are you guys thinking
about filming anymore?

138
00:09:39.036 --> 00:09:43.249
Well. John never actually
stopped filming.

139
00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:52.091
- And one of our farm favorites
is a mama pig named Emma.

140
00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:55.177
who's been taking a bit of a break...

141
00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:01.601
with a little too much time on her hands.

142
00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:09.400
At age seven.
she's not too old or too young.

143
00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:15.906
But there's no denying.
this vacation was well-earned.

144
00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:19.327
given her legendary past and all.

145
00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:23.372
-- Are there piglets?
-- Yeah. there's already eight.

146
00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:25.249
How many do you think she'll have?

147
00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:27.376
- They said. like. maybe eight or ten.

148
00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:28.753
She was our first pig.

149
00:10:29.003 --> 00:10:30.004
Good job. Emma.

150
00:10:30.212 --> 00:10:31.172
- Nine!

151
00:10:31.255 --> 00:10:32.298
- And Emma...

152
00:10:32.423 --> 00:10:33.633
Wait. is that 11?

153
00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:37.261
- ...was about to become
the most productive animal

154
00:10:37.428 --> 00:10:39.930
this farm has ever seen.

155
00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:42.892
- Oh. my gosh! Seventeen piglets!

156
00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:46.020
- This is so fun. I love our life.

157
00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:47.188
- Oh. my God.

158
00:10:48.981 --> 00:10:50.566
- Have you washed your hands. John?

159
00:10:52.401 --> 00:10:53.402
- Wow!

160
00:10:54.236 --> 00:10:57.490
- She not only produced
some of the biggest litters...

161
00:11:03.412 --> 00:11:04.413
but also...

162
00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:05.498
The runt.

163
00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:07.208
...one of the smallest piglets.

164
00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.960
We call her. "Thumbelina."

165
00:11:10.127 --> 00:11:12.254
-'Cause she's as big as a thumb.
-- Oh. my God...

166
00:11:12.421 --> 00:11:17.343
- A thriving 450 pounds
patiently navigating

167
00:11:17.927 --> 00:11:19.887
a sea of piglets.

168
00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:23.766
Ten feedings a day.

169
00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:28.813
Lessons in rooting and sleeping.

170
00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:32.316
But she always had good boundaries.

171
00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:37.446
And the piglets knew
when it was time for them to move out.

172
00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:47.998
- Of course. after six litters.
who wouldn't need a break?

173
00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:51.961
But now. it's been over a year.

174
00:11:53.003 --> 00:11:57.299
And around here.
vacations like that get noticed.

175
00:11:59.176 --> 00:12:03.764
You see.
there's this unspoken rule in farming.

176
00:12:05.182 --> 00:12:08.894
Everything on the farm
must be serving the farm

177
00:12:09.603 --> 00:12:13.566
and playing its part. or. it must go.

178
00:12:17.486 --> 00:12:22.575
That's to protect the survivability
of the farmer and the farm.

179
00:12:25.619 --> 00:12:27.037
So it's time...

180
00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:32.334
to breed our legendary pig once again.

181
00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.670
Think she's eating for 20.

182
00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:41.343
- In precisely three months.
three weeks. and three days.

183
00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.015
Emma will get another shot
at being a mama.

184
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.311
Pigs are very punctual.

185
00:12:52.354 --> 00:12:54.523
- I know where he's going.

186
00:12:55.524 --> 00:12:58.569
- We don't apply the same
pressure of productivity

187
00:12:58.736 --> 00:13:00.571
to every creature on the farm.

188
00:13:02.573 --> 00:13:06.076
But I guess you could say
this one's role

189
00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:08.871
is sort of quality control.

190
00:13:08.954 --> 00:13:10.790
- Kumquat. Kumquat.

191
00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:13.751
- Here comes Whiskers.

192
00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:15.669
- You like it?

193
00:13:17.296 --> 00:13:19.006
-- What you got there. buster?
-Peach.

194
00:13:19.423 --> 00:13:22.426
Maybe not an apple. Maybe a peach.

195
00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:24.762
- All right. not too many.

196
00:13:25.054 --> 00:13:26.430
It's ripe when it's red.

197
00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.098
- It's ripe when it's red.

198
00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:32.144
- We've yet to make a profit
on one fruit in particular.

199
00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:35.314
- I eat blueberries.

200
00:13:35.481 --> 00:13:37.316
- Hey. Beaudie. how many have you had?

201
00:13:37.733 --> 00:13:40.778
I have... one.

202
00:13:42.863 --> 00:13:44.365
And here one.

203
00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:48.702
- Beaudie!

204
00:13:53.582 --> 00:13:55.084
Beaudie. how many have you had?

205
00:13:57.253 --> 00:14:00.297
- I think about... ten?

206
00:14:03.008 --> 00:14:07.888
- And the more time passes.
the more dependable he gets...

207
00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.140
- Grab some eggs for mom. all right?

208
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.268
- Got it. I got three.

209
00:14:12.601 --> 00:14:13.769
- ...not less.

210
00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:21.819
Only five?

211
00:14:25.823 --> 00:14:28.325
- Well. it wasn't 17 piglets.

212
00:14:34.123 --> 00:14:37.001
At least we can count
on Emma's mothering skills.

213
00:14:37.084 --> 00:14:39.295
- The other two babies
are much stronger.

214
00:14:40.713 --> 00:14:41.797
- Mom rejected it.

215
00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:44.133
- Not all mothers can handle five...

216
00:14:45.676 --> 00:14:47.344
let alone one.

217
00:14:48.262 --> 00:14:50.681
- John. you need to check
on this lamb later.

218
00:14:51.807 --> 00:14:53.976
- Copy that.
It's gonna have to be after Emma.

219
00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:02.359
- Emma.

220
00:15:05.529 --> 00:15:06.697
Oh. no.

221
00:15:16.832 --> 00:15:19.001
- I've never seen her
lay on 'em like this.

222
00:15:20.878 --> 00:15:23.005
That leaves her with three.

223
00:15:37.978 --> 00:15:40.856
- If she ever lays on one.
normally she just pops right up.

224
00:15:41.982 --> 00:15:43.484
- Maybe she's going deaf.

225
00:15:45.152 --> 00:15:46.862
- I wanna clean
underneath these boards

226
00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:48.948
so she doesn't smash any more babies.

227
00:15:49.865 --> 00:15:52.201
- That's a good idea.
especially over there.

228
00:15:57.539 --> 00:15:59.917
What do you think...
enough room for a little one to escape?

229
00:16:00.084 --> 00:16:01.085
- I think so.

230
00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:06.507
- We don't have time to raise
these guys. She's gonna have to do this.

231
00:16:09.385 --> 00:16:10.719
That's too deep.

232
00:16:25.734 --> 00:16:26.735
Leonard!

233
00:16:33.367 --> 00:16:34.368
- Oh. no.

234
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.881
- What happened. Emma?

235
00:17:06.275 --> 00:17:08.444
- Okay. I'm gonna run up
to the barn and fix this.

236
00:17:18.245 --> 00:17:19.747
- You want any help with that job?

237
00:17:19.913 --> 00:17:21.749
- How'd you learn how to do this?

238
00:17:22.249 --> 00:17:24.960
- There's no one to see you.
is there anybody else that can help you?

239
00:17:25.127 --> 00:17:26.170
- YouTube.

240
00:17:27.546 --> 00:17:29.131
-- You're okay.
-- No. Molly and Hannah

241
00:17:29.256 --> 00:17:30.257
are with the chickens.

242
00:17:31.258 --> 00:17:33.343
- Okay. so as long as John keeps...

243
00:17:33.677 --> 00:17:34.887
- Oh. it's okay.

244
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:36.680
- I had to go over there
a little bit faster

245
00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:38.057
because the rain is coming.

246
00:17:38.766 --> 00:17:40.225
- Sorry. Buster.

247
00:17:40.392 --> 00:17:41.560
You're doing good.

248
00:17:47.858 --> 00:17:49.777
- Okay. are you walking?

249
00:17:50.569 --> 00:17:52.821
You just gotta be able
to get away from your mom.

250
00:17:57.534 --> 00:17:59.161
You got this. Buster.

251
00:18:12.591 --> 00:18:15.302
- Hey. I'm looking for that lamb
that...That's struggling.

252
00:18:15.469 --> 00:18:16.804
Is he still up here?

253
00:18:17.012 --> 00:18:18.305
- Yeah. he should be.

254
00:18:19.306 --> 00:18:20.390
- Hey. Mama.

255
00:18:20.557 --> 00:18:21.767
Where's your baby?

256
00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.356
Never mind. I found him.

257
00:18:37.032 --> 00:18:39.868
- Hey. I got him.
He's not doing so well.

258
00:18:40.202 --> 00:18:43.038
But I'm gonna get some colostrum in him
and that should do it.

259
00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:47.626
Well. you know where I'll be tonight.

260
00:18:50.671 --> 00:18:52.089
- Good Monday morning.

261
00:18:52.256 --> 00:18:54.466
Drizzle of light rain in the morning
and then it gets

262
00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:55.843
a little heavier in the afternoon.

263
00:18:56.343 --> 00:18:58.137
It's going to be much cooler
than yesterday

264
00:18:58.345 --> 00:19:00.264
with a high of 60 degrees...

265
00:19:16.655 --> 00:19:17.739
- Hang in there. buddy.

266
00:19:19.908 --> 00:19:22.202
Come on. Blue. Let's get started.

267
00:19:27.791 --> 00:19:30.878
- Our life has become
a bit of a circus.

268
00:19:32.379 --> 00:19:34.047
And yet. it all works.

269
00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:40.053
Because everything here
adds something back.

270
00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.097
- What are you guys doing
in my office?

271
00:19:42.723 --> 00:19:45.893
- Including the latest addition
to our family.

272
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:51.356
- Blue. don't hurt him.

273
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:59.740
- What have you done?

274
00:19:59.907 --> 00:20:04.244
Look at this adorable...
No. Blue. Blue. no! Blue.

275
00:20:04.411 --> 00:20:08.582
- At first. we figured our dog. Blue.
wouldn't contribute much

276
00:20:08.749 --> 00:20:10.292
to the actual farming...

277
00:20:12.127 --> 00:20:15.672
but then Blue found another pest.

278
00:20:17.507 --> 00:20:19.509
Blue. stop! Blue!

279
00:20:28.644 --> 00:20:29.645
- Blue...

280
00:20:30.687 --> 00:20:32.981
the hunter of rabbits.

281
00:20:38.612 --> 00:20:41.782
- I just went and looked for the lamb.
and he's not here.

282
00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:48.372
And I look over behind the toilet...

283
00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:52.042
and he's peeing.

284
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.254
very close to where it needed to be.

285
00:20:55.545 --> 00:20:57.547
Blue. do you think you can do that?

286
00:20:59.591 --> 00:21:02.219
-We're gonna try to. like...
-Yep.

287
00:21:02.386 --> 00:21:04.263
...waggle it back and forth.

288
00:21:06.765 --> 00:21:08.725
So sideways while it gets in there.

289
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:14.231
Yup. go closer to him so he can...
And now tilt it. Okay.

290
00:22:36.563 --> 00:22:37.773
- Hey. Emma.

291
00:22:40.817 --> 00:22:42.444
Okay. where's Buster?

292
00:22:43.236 --> 00:22:44.529
No.

293
00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:46.698
Not him.

294
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:55.040
Come on. Buster.

295
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:16.603
- Leonard to John.

296
00:23:18.688 --> 00:23:19.981
- I'm sorry. Buster.

297
00:23:22.901 --> 00:23:23.902
Go ahead.

298
00:23:24.528 --> 00:23:25.904
- Are you done with Emma?

299
00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:33.954
- Each decision gets more difficult
because of the ways...

300
00:23:34.121 --> 00:23:35.789
- I know what you'd like.

301
00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.626
- ...that we allow these beings
into our hearts.

302
00:23:41.169 --> 00:23:42.379
- What's your name?

303
00:23:44.172 --> 00:23:47.426
You look like you have a mohawk.
I'm gonna call you "Mo."

304
00:23:51.179 --> 00:23:52.848
We call this the fruit basket.

305
00:23:55.976 --> 00:23:57.352
Oh. that's grass.

306
00:24:16.705 --> 00:24:17.664
- Hey.

307
00:24:24.421 --> 00:24:25.422
Hey.

308
00:24:26.715 --> 00:24:27.799
Hey.

309
00:24:35.432 --> 00:24:36.683
Hey. come on.

310
00:24:52.949 --> 00:24:55.994
- All righty. Mo.
Are you ready for this?

311
00:24:58.163 --> 00:25:00.290
Do you think he'll make some friends?

312
00:25:01.583 --> 00:25:04.252
- I hope so.
That's what we'll have to see.

313
00:25:19.434 --> 00:25:24.397
- And as for Emma. and the question
of when a pig is too old to breed...

314
00:25:28.318 --> 00:25:30.487
A wise old farmer once told me.

315
00:25:31.238 --> 00:25:33.406
"You'll know when you know."

316
00:25:37.118 --> 00:25:39.162
Well. now we know.

317
00:25:46.169 --> 00:25:49.506
Sometimes. in spite of the uncertainty.

318
00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:54.010
it can be enough to simply show up.

319
00:26:31.214 --> 00:26:34.342
Can I ask you what makes you optimistic
about the future?

320
00:26:34.926 --> 00:26:37.012
We came on to this piece of land here

321
00:26:37.721 --> 00:26:40.640
it had been extractively farmed
for 45 years.

322
00:26:41.558 --> 00:26:44.227
And then in eight years’ time.

323
00:26:44.394 --> 00:26:46.938
we regenerated it to something
that was better

324
00:26:47.063 --> 00:26:48.523
than what it was even 45 years ago.

325
00:26:52.736 --> 00:26:56.364
That resilience that exists
within the natural world

326
00:26:56.948 --> 00:27:01.119
gives me so much hope
because it's just waiting for us

327
00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.831
to unleash its full potential.

328
00:27:11.087 --> 00:27:13.882
- As long as we continue to show up.

329
00:27:14.341 --> 00:27:19.137
each day our little world
will reveal more of its secrets.

330
00:27:43.536 --> 00:27:44.537
- Get away from it!

331
00:27:44.996 --> 00:27:46.122
Watch out!

332
00:27:46.873 --> 00:27:50.418
- And while our farm
may never reach a perfect harmony.

333
00:27:53.922 --> 00:27:58.343
it is alive with infinite possibilities.

334
00:28:00.136 --> 00:28:05.850
The ecosystem of our planet
works the same way.

335
00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:16.111
- Oh. no. There goes Blue.

336
00:28:19.656 --> 00:28:21.408
- Blue. wait up!
