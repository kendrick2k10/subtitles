3
00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:56.181
- This is Northwest Mosul.

4
00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.809
- These are people
fleeing from ISIS.

5
00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:21.039
- My family. my teammates.
we are in Northwest Mosul.

6
00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:24.375
To help in a conflict situation.

7
00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:30.799
Iraqi Army is there fighting ISIS.

8
00:01:40.016 --> 00:01:40.850
Three streets over.

9
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.311
ISIS is killing everybody
across the main highway.

10
00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:49.359
Against a far wall.
there were living people.

11
00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:58.576
Everybody's thinking the same thing.

12
00:02:00.078 --> 00:02:03.498
You go near that little girl. you're dead.

13
00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:09.003
Taking a step will very
likely cost you everything.

14
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.800
Within the last 24 years.

15
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.470
everything we've done culminates here.

16
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.305
right in one place.

17
00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:24.435
Because I'm trying to save this little girl.

18
00:02:26.604 --> 00:02:28.606
Whoever wants to go. go.

19
00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:31.484
Jesus helped me.

20
00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:03.725
- Eubank formed
the group 20 years ago

21
00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:05.602
but expanded his teams to operate

22
00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:08.605
in places like Sudan and Iraq.

23
00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:10.315
- While
hundreds of thousands fled.

24
00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:13.193
an American and his family moved in.

25
00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:14.903
- To help victims that are caught on

26
00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:17.780
the front lines of the war on terror.

27
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.073
- His wife and three children

28
00:03:19.073 --> 00:03:23.328
have joined him on all his
missions to war torn areas.

29
00:03:23.328 --> 00:03:27.498
The family is taking a break
this week in Washington state.

30
00:03:27.498 --> 00:03:28.583
- We'll be in the country

31
00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:30.668
for at least a month. maybe more.

32
00:03:30.668 --> 00:03:33.296
- But all
plan to go back to Iraq.

33
00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:36.216
- Your story's moving
viewers around the world.

34
00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:37.175
- The Eubank family ...

35
00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:39.260
it seems crazy what are they doing.

36
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.471
- Well as a reporter from the outside.
I agree.

37
00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:43.181
But as I spent time with them
on the front lines.

38
00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:45.558
it felt surprisingly normal.

39
00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:51.856
- One definition of adventure is

40
00:03:51.856 --> 00:03:53.358
you don't know what's gonna happen.

41
00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:55.318
You don't know.

42
00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:07.747
Everywhere. every person
in the world has something

43
00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:09.832
good and wonderful that we can love.

44
00:04:09.832 --> 00:04:11.501
learn from and build up.

45
00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:13.211
And stand together against evil.

46
00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:15.046
And help people who are oppressed.

47
00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:16.547
I want that story to be told.

48
00:04:32.563 --> 00:04:33.815
I was born in Texas.

49
00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:35.400
Always a Texan.

50
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.694
But I grew up as a
missionary kid in Thailand.

51
00:04:39.278 --> 00:04:41.489
As a missionary kid. I remember thinking.

52
00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:43.783
I think I'm more of a soldier.

53
00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:45.660
I'm more of that action guy.

54
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.079
I'm not sure if I'll be a missionary.

55
00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:50.164
And I went to Texas A&M University.

56
00:04:50.164 --> 00:04:52.000
where I was in the the Corps of Cadets.

57
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.420
I then became a US Army officer
as scout platoon leader.

58
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.380
and then 2nd Ranger Battalion.

59
00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.716
and then after that 1st
Special Forces Group.

60
00:05:00.591 --> 00:05:02.844
But after ten years.

61
00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:05.471
I felt God had something
else for me to do.

62
00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:08.808
And so. I decided to
get out of the military.

63
00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:10.184
Serve as a missionary.

64
00:05:10.184 --> 00:05:13.563
And in the middle of that. I met Karen.

65
00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:24.907
- When we first met I was amazed.

66
00:05:24.907 --> 00:05:26.367
No. I wasn't amazed .

67
00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:31.622
- And I asked her out and she said no.

68
00:05:31.622 --> 00:05:34.334
But she agreed later to go climbing.

69
00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:35.960
And I took her on some technically climbs

70
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.795
in Washington State.

71
00:05:37.795 --> 00:05:40.256
And she summited. which is not easy.

72
00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:43.092
I said. "God let me marry
this woman. I'll do anything."

73
00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:47.096
- Climbing was something
I'd never done before.

74
00:05:49.932 --> 00:05:51.851
And he was strong and committed

75
00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:54.437
and had the goal of us all summiting.

76
00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:58.566
And I had no idea even
what that meant. summiting.

77
00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:04.739
- We did it.

78
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.033
- We're on the summit of Mt. Rainier.

79
00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:09.369
by the grace of God and good friends.

80
00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:10.203
Awesome!

81
00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:11.079
Free Burma!

82
00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:11.913
- Rangers!

83
00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:18.377
Going back down he asked me.

84
00:06:18.377 --> 00:06:19.587
"Do you wanna do this again?"

85
00:06:19.587 --> 00:06:21.881
And I was a bit resistant. 'cause again.

86
00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:25.134
I wasn't sure about a
relationship at that point.

87
00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:31.808
- In March 1993. I got a call
from my dad. a missionary.

88
00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:36.646
- An ethnic general inside of Burma.

89
00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:38.147
came and contacted me and said.

90
00:06:38.147 --> 00:06:39.315
"We've heard about your son.

91
00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:42.360
he's a soldier. were
soldiers. and we want help."

92
00:06:43.861 --> 00:06:46.030
- And says "Dave you gotta pray.
are you gonna come or not?"

93
00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.658
And I said. I prayed
right on the spot. yes.

94
00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:51.285
And I turned to Karen and
said I'm going to Burma.

95
00:06:51.285 --> 00:06:52.912
Will you come with me?

96
00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:54.539
Will you marry me?

97
00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:56.499
- I felt in my heart.

98
00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:58.042
say no and let it go.

99
00:06:58.042 --> 00:07:00.628
or you say yes and you get in.

100
00:07:00.628 --> 00:07:01.963
- Its not often that we think of a

101
00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:03.840
combination of a missionary and a soldier.

102
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.800
And that became a conflict.

103
00:07:06.634 --> 00:07:09.387
But he has to listen
to what God tells him.

104
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.056
And now you can kiss the bride.

105
00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:17.145
- Karen and I got married.

106
00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:20.356
And starting our mission on into Burma.

107
00:07:20.356 --> 00:07:22.150
that was our honeymoon.

108
00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:32.952
- Over fifty years of
civil war have left Burma

109
00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:35.496
one of the poorest countries in the world.

110
00:07:35.496 --> 00:07:38.708
The military dictatorship
attacks its own people.

111
00:07:41.752 --> 00:07:44.255
Pro-democracy Burmese and ethnic groups

112
00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:46.090
try to protect their people.

113
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.093
and resist the attacks of the Burma Army.

114
00:07:53.097 --> 00:07:57.185
- The country is about 60%
Burman majority people.

115
00:07:57.185 --> 00:08:00.480
who live in the central
plains of Burma. mostly.

116
00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.232
But then in the mountains.
there are the ethnic people.

117
00:08:03.232 --> 00:08:05.443
which make up about 40% of Burma.

118
00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:08.738
Back in 1997. I saw people running across

119
00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:10.072
the border of Burma to Thailand.

120
00:08:10.072 --> 00:08:11.699
It was 10.000 people on a road.

121
00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:13.159
just running for their lives.

122
00:08:19.081 --> 00:08:21.626
- We heard there might even
be a genocide going on.

123
00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:25.504
And it was the government's
policy to keep it isolated.

124
00:08:25.504 --> 00:08:28.299
And yet we knew we had to go and respond.

125
00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:31.177
- My wife and I prayed.

126
00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:33.679
I loaded the truck up with
four backpacks of medicine.

127
00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:35.598
and like a 100 bucks in my pocket.

128
00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:37.350
and I drove to the border.

129
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.936
And thought well. I'll
help one person at least.

130
00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:41.187
and they'll be glad and I'll be glad.

131
00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:42.939
and I'll have no other plan. Just go.

132
00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:44.190
Go to the sound of guns.

133
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.816
Go to the sound of need.

134
00:08:45.816 --> 00:08:49.237
And trust God to show you
how you can be useful.

135
00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:18.808
- I'm going forward down the road.

136
00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:19.767
And there was people fleeing.

137
00:09:19.767 --> 00:09:21.686
and they're carrying all
their worldly possessions.

138
00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:23.938
Basket on their back with
pots and pans and food.

139
00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:26.148
Kids on their shoulders.
kids in their arms.

140
00:09:27.483 --> 00:09:30.152
And behind them you hear.
"Boom Boom Bam Bam Bam Bam".

141
00:09:31.112 --> 00:09:33.030
As their villages burned behind them.

142
00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:39.161
And out of the jungle
steps a man from Burma.

143
00:09:39.161 --> 00:09:42.707
He's wearing full fatigues
with hand grenades. M16. earring.

144
00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.552
- And he said. "Hello. my name is. Eliya."

145
00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:55.428
I'm a medic.

146
00:09:57.722 --> 00:10:02.435
- And I said. "You look like a
pirate. like a pirate angel."

147
00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:03.561
An answer to prayer.

148
00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:08.816
- He picked four guys out and

149
00:10:08.816 --> 00:10:10.443
they came and picked up
the backpacks of medicine.

150
00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:13.237
And we all went together. and
started treating patients.

151
00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:15.489
And we could organize quickly

152
00:10:15.489 --> 00:10:17.783
because there's only a
handful of us. And we could just go.

153
00:10:41.015 --> 00:10:45.061
- And I held IV bags and
we were the helpers to him.

154
00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:48.939
Gunshot by Burma soldiers.

155
00:10:48.939 --> 00:10:52.610
Successful removal of the bullet by Eliya.

156
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.695
We treated over a
thousand people that week.

157
00:10:54.695 --> 00:10:55.529
Eliya did.

158
00:10:57.823 --> 00:10:59.116
When we first started.

159
00:10:59.116 --> 00:11:00.576
it was just a few people together.

160
00:11:00.576 --> 00:11:02.328
As we did these relief missions.

161
00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:04.663
more and more ethnic
people began to join us.

162
00:11:04.663 --> 00:11:07.792
And we became a 10 - 20 person group.

163
00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:11.879
After a few years. different
ethnic leaders came to us

164
00:11:11.879 --> 00:11:13.964
and said. "We really like your teams."

165
00:11:13.964 --> 00:11:16.258
"Can you make teams for us like that?"

166
00:11:16.258 --> 00:11:19.053
"If we give you people to
train. will you train them?"

167
00:11:20.554 --> 00:11:22.390
We prayed. and said. "Okay we will."

168
00:11:25.309 --> 00:11:26.519
We wanted freedom.

169
00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:27.978
We're in Burma.

170
00:11:27.978 --> 00:11:30.147
And Rangers had meant a lot to me

171
00:11:30.147 --> 00:11:32.108
when I was an U.S. Army Ranger.

172
00:11:33.442 --> 00:11:36.404
And I said. "Okay. we just call
us the Free Burma Rangers."

173
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.909
As we've grown. people
have come from the outside

174
00:11:41.909 --> 00:11:43.160
to help as volunteers.

175
00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.829
To support the teams in the field.

176
00:11:48.332 --> 00:11:50.042
What it's about is loving people.

177
00:11:50.042 --> 00:11:52.670
It's saying here's everything
I have. it's yours.

178
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.213
How can we serve you?

179
00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:57.883
And give them immediate and
best medical care we can give.

180
00:11:59.176 --> 00:12:01.095
All the food and supplies we can give.

181
00:12:02.346 --> 00:12:04.598
And to do it bravely and boldly.

182
00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:09.228
And become a family.

183
00:13:08.078 --> 00:13:12.333
- An IDP is an Internally
Displaced Person.

184
00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:13.375
We're at an IDP site.

185
00:13:14.335 --> 00:13:17.713
And they've had to flee because
their homes been burned.

186
00:13:17.713 --> 00:13:19.798
The Burma Army is just over there.

187
00:13:19.798 --> 00:13:21.217
And if you look at how they're living.

188
00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:23.135
it's not much.

189
00:13:51.997 --> 00:13:56.001
- It's important to document and
archive what's happening.

190
00:13:56.001 --> 00:13:57.586
So that people can see with their own eyes

191
00:13:57.586 --> 00:13:58.712
and make their own decisions.

192
00:13:58.712 --> 00:14:00.214
That's really happening.

193
00:14:00.214 --> 00:14:03.467
The Armenian Massacre has
been denied by many people.

194
00:14:03.467 --> 00:14:05.094
Many people denied the Jews were

195
00:14:05.094 --> 00:14:06.971
getting killed in World War II.

196
00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:09.014
But once people saw with their
own eyes. the photographs.

197
00:14:09.014 --> 00:14:11.976
the film of what's happened.
they're like. oh. that's real.

198
00:14:31.954 --> 00:14:33.789
- As we went on these relief missions.

199
00:14:33.789 --> 00:14:36.834
Monkey started filming all the abuses.

200
00:14:36.834 --> 00:14:38.586
all the situations we saw
in the jungle.

201
00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:48.197
- And the people who did it.

202
00:15:48.197 --> 00:15:49.281
They got away with it.

203
00:15:50.908 --> 00:15:51.784
Just evil.

204
00:16:05.464 --> 00:16:06.799
We walked over and we prayed for

205
00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:08.342
the people that had been killed.

206
00:16:08.342 --> 00:16:09.760
Dear God. thank you for this lady.

207
00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.136
thank you for these people.

208
00:16:11.136 --> 00:16:13.639
thank you for having them in heaven.

209
00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:15.933
And we said. "We can't
make any of this right.

210
00:16:17.184 --> 00:16:19.812
"but I know God doesn't
like it and we're with you.

211
00:16:23.857 --> 00:16:25.484
"We'll help you the best we can."

212
00:16:32.908 --> 00:16:34.660
So. all we could do is
pray for the family.

213
00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.412
write the story up and send it out.

214
00:16:37.579 --> 00:16:39.540
To anybody on our list who cares.

215
00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:43.502
Churches. U.S. State
Department. Foreign Governments.

216
00:16:49.425 --> 00:16:51.009
I hope someone does something with it.

217
00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:36.055
Do you think to change your
country is easy or hard?

218
00:17:39.266 --> 00:17:40.142
- Hard.

219
00:17:40.142 --> 00:17:43.896
Do you think the enemy is
serious or not so serious?

220
00:17:45.397 --> 00:17:46.273
- Serious.

221
00:17:47.775 --> 00:17:50.360
Never give up. never surrender.

222
00:17:57.993 --> 00:18:02.956
After 24 years. we have
trained over 4.500 teams.

223
00:18:03.207 --> 00:18:05.959
to get them ready to help
in a conflict situation.

224
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.843
They can be a man or woman. young or old.

225
00:18:20.057 --> 00:18:22.309
And people can be from any religion.

226
00:18:22.309 --> 00:18:25.062
They just have to come because
they love their people.

227
00:18:25.062 --> 00:18:26.355
And they have to have courage.

228
00:18:26.355 --> 00:18:29.733
which means they cannot run
if the people cannot run.

229
00:18:29.733 --> 00:18:31.360
And we move with the resistance.

230
00:18:32.694 --> 00:18:34.154
We use Free Burma Rangers t-shirts

231
00:18:34.154 --> 00:18:36.281
but look pretty much like them.

232
00:18:36.281 --> 00:18:38.033
But we don't have a
program to arm our teams.

233
00:18:38.033 --> 00:18:39.785
We're not pacifists. but if
they are gonna be armed.

234
00:18:39.785 --> 00:18:41.078
they arm themselves.

235
00:18:55.592 --> 00:18:56.552
- We'll set up the route.

236
00:18:56.552 --> 00:18:58.428
And then we'll go village by village.

237
00:19:05.185 --> 00:19:07.187
Our mission will be comprised of

238
00:19:07.187 --> 00:19:09.773
setting up a medical clinic.
doing a kids program.

239
00:19:09.773 --> 00:19:11.692
and then sometimes a team will go off

240
00:19:11.692 --> 00:19:14.027
and do a recon of Burma
Army at the same time.

241
00:19:16.488 --> 00:19:18.866
- In Burma. on
missions. you're walking.

242
00:19:38.218 --> 00:19:39.803
- I think the early days.

243
00:19:39.803 --> 00:19:41.221
I felt like I could do that.

244
00:19:41.221 --> 00:19:42.806
I could hike with the backpack.

245
00:19:45.517 --> 00:19:47.311
But when the kids came along.

246
00:19:48.604 --> 00:19:50.397
definitely became more challenging.

247
00:19:58.488 --> 00:20:00.240
Early on. Dave and I had decided.

248
00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:03.118
that we were going to
keep our kids with us.

249
00:20:03.118 --> 00:20:04.661
You know it took a little
bit of conversation.

250
00:20:04.661 --> 00:20:07.831
But I knew we wanted to
stay together as a family.

251
00:20:07.831 --> 00:20:10.542
And I knew I wanted to support his vision.

252
00:20:10.542 --> 00:20:12.294
But it was often day to
day. I thought this was

253
00:20:12.294 --> 00:20:14.588
the craziest thing in the world to do.

254
00:20:18.634 --> 00:20:21.053
- Go Ranger. go Ranger.

255
00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:24.723
- The risks were challenging.

256
00:20:24.723 --> 00:20:27.434
The health risks were always
out there for little kids.

257
00:20:27.434 --> 00:20:30.187
Whether it's what you eat.
whether it's what bit you.

258
00:20:30.187 --> 00:20:33.315
- This is the skin
of a python that we ate.

259
00:20:33.315 --> 00:20:35.400
- Whether it's what you fall off of.

260
00:20:36.318 --> 00:20:37.778
- What does a baby tiger say?

261
00:20:37.778 --> 00:20:38.654
- Roar!

262
00:20:38.654 --> 00:20:39.863
- Yikes.

263
00:20:39.863 --> 00:20:42.324
- I learned early on
not to play with fear.

264
00:20:42.324 --> 00:20:45.410
In a very uncontrolled situation.

265
00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:47.663
- You're gonna jump over a
log so just hold on. okay?

266
00:20:48.997 --> 00:20:50.666
- Burma is wild.

267
00:20:50.666 --> 00:20:52.834
We would ride our horses
through the jungles.

268
00:20:52.834 --> 00:20:56.255
Or we would swim in the
waterfalls. in the rivers.

269
00:20:56.255 --> 00:20:58.966
Had numerous amounts of pets.

270
00:20:58.966 --> 00:21:01.134
Workouts with the rangers in the morning.

271
00:21:04.262 --> 00:21:07.391
- So. when I was growing up.
I always loved the water.

272
00:21:07.391 --> 00:21:08.892
My dad really encouraged that.

273
00:21:20.946 --> 00:21:24.324
- If I could live anywhere in
the world. where would I live?

274
00:21:26.076 --> 00:21:27.411
Burma.

275
00:21:27.411 --> 00:21:30.580
- My kids have thousands
of aunts and uncles.

276
00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.083
In Burma. in Iraq. all over the place.

277
00:21:37.504 --> 00:21:39.923
Day in. day out. through
and in up the mountains.

278
00:21:41.466 --> 00:21:43.593
Just rolling just like the ethnic people.

279
00:21:43.593 --> 00:21:45.554
It's not like my kids are the only ones.

280
00:21:45.554 --> 00:21:48.765
You look at any ethnic
group in the mountains.

281
00:21:48.765 --> 00:21:49.933
That's just normal life.

282
00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:57.524
- You do your work. and I want
you to solve your problems.

283
00:21:58.358 --> 00:21:59.735
- Did you do anything wrong?

284
00:22:00.694 --> 00:22:04.781
- Raising kids in Burma
was an amazing experience.

285
00:22:45.781 --> 00:22:46.656
- You say.

286
00:22:55.999 --> 00:22:58.043
- The war in Burma is the longest running

287
00:22:58.043 --> 00:22:59.753
civil war in the world.

288
00:22:59.753 --> 00:23:00.670
My old brother!

289
00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:02.422
And it continues even to right now.

290
00:23:21.525 --> 00:23:25.112
- I think that there is a sense
of the spiritual connection.

291
00:23:25.112 --> 00:23:29.783
When you know that you have
an inconfidence or insecurity

292
00:23:29.783 --> 00:23:31.868
about where you are and what you're doing.

293
00:23:33.703 --> 00:23:35.247
Doesn't matter how bad it is.

294
00:23:36.456 --> 00:23:38.041
If you run we'll run with you.

295
00:23:38.041 --> 00:23:39.501
But we're not gonna be gone.

296
00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:41.503
If you're having a problem

297
00:23:41.503 --> 00:23:43.839
we are staying with you
no matter what happens.

298
00:23:54.307 --> 00:23:56.017
- All of us could be these people.

299
00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:59.312
They didn't choose to come here.

300
00:23:59.312 --> 00:24:00.814
they were forced to come here.

301
00:24:01.773 --> 00:24:04.192
Or die or be slaves.

302
00:24:04.192 --> 00:24:05.735
So. Lord. help us tell their stories

303
00:24:05.735 --> 00:24:07.779
and ask the right questions.

304
00:24:07.779 --> 00:24:10.740
And bless these guys.
Lord. every one of us.

305
00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.701
In Jesus' name. Amen.

306
00:24:12.701 --> 00:24:13.535
Keep going.

307
00:25:03.335 --> 00:25:05.921
- Right in the tree line right there.

308
00:25:07.756 --> 00:25:09.007
You can hear the shooting.

309
00:25:11.468 --> 00:25:12.802
So that truck just fled.

310
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:14.804
There's a mortar.

311
00:25:17.557 --> 00:25:18.934
Guys running down the road.

312
00:25:35.575 --> 00:25:37.953
Burma Army is coming. about 7 kilometers

313
00:25:37.953 --> 00:25:40.288
4.5 miles away. that way.

314
00:25:40.288 --> 00:25:41.539
They're all running away.

315
00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.502
- The kids and I don't
go on recon missions.

316
00:25:45.502 --> 00:25:47.128
The missions are for the Rangers.

317
00:26:28.545 --> 00:26:30.380
- Ya they see us here.

318
00:26:38.346 --> 00:26:41.933
We're there with a medic
in case someone gets shot.

319
00:26:41.933 --> 00:26:44.728
But also with cameras. to
film. what now is a fire fight.

320
00:26:44.728 --> 00:26:46.688
Between the Kachin Army.

321
00:26:46.688 --> 00:26:48.273
Trying to hold back the Burma Army

322
00:26:48.273 --> 00:26:50.525
who's in the jungle
across the little creek.

323
00:26:51.359 --> 00:26:52.527
You here that?

324
00:26:53.528 --> 00:26:54.946
That's the flank.

325
00:26:55.905 --> 00:26:56.948
Someones over there.

326
00:27:11.129 --> 00:27:12.297
We're showing the Burma Army.

327
00:27:12.297 --> 00:27:14.841
They've captured 18
people from this village.

328
00:27:14.841 --> 00:27:16.718
Shooting the heck out of us right now.

329
00:27:18.428 --> 00:27:20.221
And. they'd kill us if they can.

330
00:27:21.181 --> 00:27:23.767
Our job is to stand with these people.

331
00:27:23.767 --> 00:27:26.353
Get the news out and survive.

332
00:27:29.731 --> 00:27:31.191
All right. I'll send you.

333
00:27:31.191 --> 00:27:32.776
I don't know what time
I can get it out today.

334
00:27:32.776 --> 00:27:33.860
Depends on what happens here.

335
00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:36.071
But I'll send you a
report and some photos.

336
00:27:37.405 --> 00:27:38.948
That's Denis Gray. AP News.

337
00:27:46.748 --> 00:27:48.375
AP News sent it all over.

338
00:27:53.672 --> 00:27:55.382
BBC used it.

339
00:27:55.382 --> 00:27:57.175
That's what we were able to document.

340
00:28:02.514 --> 00:28:06.059
The news getting out is a success.

341
00:28:06.059 --> 00:28:08.728
But it's just a piece of a large goal.

342
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:13.149
I think the largest goal
we have is find a way.

343
00:28:13.149 --> 00:28:14.943
not just to solve a
problem or bring justice.

344
00:28:14.943 --> 00:28:16.111
but reconciliation.

345
00:28:19.489 --> 00:28:22.450
- Before I got married. I was
a special education teacher.

346
00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:24.661
And now that I was in these villages.

347
00:28:24.661 --> 00:28:27.330
I was asking myself how can I bring hope?

348
00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:29.332
How can I bring new life to the situation?

349
00:28:29.332 --> 00:28:30.625
Good Afternoon.

350
00:28:30.625 --> 00:28:32.085
Hope is what keeps us going.

351
00:28:36.214 --> 00:28:37.674
So. we will sing songs

352
00:28:37.674 --> 00:28:40.093
and have some drama and some teaching.

353
00:28:40.093 --> 00:28:43.888
Good life for your soul and
good life for your body.

354
00:28:59.154 --> 00:29:01.948
I hope they go away with encouragement.

355
00:29:01.948 --> 00:29:03.575
That people love them.

356
00:29:04.576 --> 00:29:07.620
Like your shirt says "good
life comes from God".

357
00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:11.374
I will pray God gives you a
lot of good life in your heart.

358
00:29:15.128 --> 00:29:17.255
That good will over come evil.

359
00:29:17.255 --> 00:29:22.093
And green. God gives you good things.

360
00:29:22.969 --> 00:29:25.638
Because you can't control
what happens in the future.

361
00:29:44.866 --> 00:29:46.785
The next year it was completely empty.

362
00:29:48.453 --> 00:29:50.371
And how quickly did they have to leave?

363
00:30:00.006 --> 00:30:02.342
Read. it says. a thief steals things.

364
00:30:05.094 --> 00:30:06.679
soldiers fight for our country.

365
00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:36.835
The next day. we met a lady
who came to us and said.

366
00:30:36.835 --> 00:30:39.629
"Please help me bury my
mother and my brother.

367
00:30:39.629 --> 00:30:41.923
"They were killed by the
Burma Army last week.

368
00:30:42.966 --> 00:30:43.883
"Will you help me?"

369
00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:46.845
And we prayed and said yes.

370
00:30:52.475 --> 00:30:54.143
And I ask that you bless her.

371
00:30:54.978 --> 00:30:56.604
And give her in this land peace.

372
00:30:56.604 --> 00:30:59.857
from this day on. in Jesus name. Amen.

373
00:31:01.359 --> 00:31:03.069
While we were in this village.

374
00:31:03.069 --> 00:31:04.529
I'm standing with a pastor.

375
00:31:04.529 --> 00:31:05.947
He suddenly gets a message.

376
00:31:07.574 --> 00:31:09.492
The Burma Army have gone into

377
00:31:09.492 --> 00:31:13.162
the house of two young volunteers.

378
00:31:13.162 --> 00:31:17.292
20 year old volunteers who were
Kachin missionary teachers.

379
00:31:18.334 --> 00:31:21.129
And they'd gone in and
they'd raped these woman

380
00:31:21.129 --> 00:31:22.839
and then beat them to death.

381
00:31:22.839 --> 00:31:24.507
We already had a photo of it.

382
00:31:27.093 --> 00:31:28.177
You can see the woman.

383
00:31:29.178 --> 00:31:31.764
Fingers broken. blood everywhere.

384
00:31:31.764 --> 00:31:34.934
And you see this huge piece
of wood about this long

385
00:31:34.934 --> 00:31:36.686
that thick with blood all over it

386
00:31:36.686 --> 00:31:39.063
where they'd just beaten
these ladies to death.

387
00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:41.774
After they raped them.

388
00:31:48.781 --> 00:31:50.241
I want you to see this photo.

389
00:31:59.334 --> 00:32:00.168
How do you feel?

390
00:32:01.544 --> 00:32:02.378
Anger?

391
00:32:03.546 --> 00:32:04.672
I tell you how I feel.

392
00:32:07.383 --> 00:32:09.135
I wanna kill every Burmese soldier.

393
00:32:13.473 --> 00:32:14.724
That's what I want to do.

394
00:32:16.601 --> 00:32:19.812
Dear God. I am so sorry for those girls.

395
00:32:19.812 --> 00:32:20.688
and their family.

396
00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.235
I do want to kill all the Burma Army.

397
00:32:26.235 --> 00:32:28.029
no question in my mind.

398
00:32:28.863 --> 00:32:30.490
Help me know how to --

399
00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:32.241
I don't know how to forgive them.

400
00:32:32.241 --> 00:32:35.620
I only dare to do that
because you commanded it.

401
00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:36.829
I don't even want to forgive them.

402
00:32:36.829 --> 00:32:38.081
I just want to kill them.

403
00:32:38.915 --> 00:32:40.625
But I'll obey you Lord.

404
00:32:40.625 --> 00:32:44.337
So help me to forgive
them and to love them.

405
00:32:47.965 --> 00:32:50.176
So. all we could do is write the story up.

406
00:32:50.176 --> 00:32:53.554
Pray for the family. write
the story and send it out.

407
00:32:53.554 --> 00:32:55.139
And it went all over the world.

408
00:33:09.737 --> 00:33:11.614
It would be really simple if the world

409
00:33:11.614 --> 00:33:13.908
was just like Lord of the Rings.

410
00:33:13.908 --> 00:33:15.743
Here's the humans and
the elves and the dwarves

411
00:33:15.743 --> 00:33:17.370
and the hobbits and we're pretty good.

412
00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:19.622
And there's the evil orcs
and they're all terrible.

413
00:33:19.622 --> 00:33:22.333
And so. the line of evil is here.

414
00:33:22.333 --> 00:33:24.961
And they're all evil and we're all good.

415
00:33:24.961 --> 00:33:27.422
But in real life the line of good and evil

416
00:33:27.422 --> 00:33:30.049
isn't between us and other people.

417
00:33:30.049 --> 00:33:32.635
As Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn said.
the Russian dissident.

418
00:33:32.635 --> 00:33:35.304
He said. "the line is in our hearts".

419
00:33:35.304 --> 00:33:36.389
Each humans heart.

420
00:33:36.389 --> 00:33:37.640
This is the first battle.

421
00:33:48.568 --> 00:33:51.738
Saw Nay Htoo was a small boy. was
taken by the Burma Army.

422
00:33:51.738 --> 00:33:55.575
And then put in the Burma
Army. fighting his own people.

423
00:33:57.493 --> 00:34:00.246
When he came to us. he didn't say a lot.

424
00:34:00.246 --> 00:34:02.582
Except we knew he escaped
from the Burma Army.

425
00:34:20.892 --> 00:34:24.312
And he came to us and he
said. "you know. I'm so bad.

426
00:34:24.312 --> 00:34:26.439
"I don't know if God
would ever forgive me."

427
00:34:39.327 --> 00:34:41.162
The people that he confessed all this to.

428
00:34:41.162 --> 00:34:42.038
he had attacked.

429
00:34:45.708 --> 00:34:48.002
And nobody killed him.

430
00:34:48.544 --> 00:34:50.296
And people forgave him.

431
00:35:09.607 --> 00:35:11.108
He'd asked to be baptized.

432
00:35:11.526 --> 00:35:13.820
So. we baptized him in
the river at our camp.

433
00:35:38.135 --> 00:35:40.888
Forgiveness is a counter warfare

434
00:35:41.973 --> 00:35:44.183
that has eternal energy to it.

435
00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:52.210
- Originally reported
by the BBC.

436
00:36:52.501 --> 00:36:55.421
The Burma Government has changed
their name to Myanmar.

437
00:36:55.421 --> 00:36:57.882
Claiming reforms. and then a ceasefire.

438
00:36:58.299 --> 00:37:00.927
Yet new footage filmed
by the Free Burma Rangers

439
00:37:01.344 --> 00:37:03.930
proves that the world's longest
running civil war

440
00:37:04.222 --> 00:37:05.556
rages on.

441
00:37:11.562 --> 00:37:14.023
- Reports of
atrocities now documented

442
00:37:14.023 --> 00:37:17.193
by a group determined to
bring the truth to light.

443
00:37:18.361 --> 00:37:20.863
- One camp we filmed was
right after the Burma Army

444
00:37:20.863 --> 00:37:24.325
told the United Nations they
don't use any forced labor.

445
00:37:24.325 --> 00:37:27.453
Well here was at least 60 people captured.

446
00:37:27.453 --> 00:37:30.081
just carrying supplies for the Burma Army.

447
00:37:30.081 --> 00:37:31.248
We sent it out.

448
00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:36.545
The next day the UN representative
showed the commander.

449
00:37:36.545 --> 00:37:37.922
Hey. what are these people?

450
00:37:40.383 --> 00:37:42.385
- Ethnic
separatist are increasingly

451
00:37:42.385 --> 00:37:45.054
under attack by the Burmese Army.

452
00:37:45.054 --> 00:37:47.014
It's a conflict that outside their region

453
00:37:47.014 --> 00:37:48.808
has attracted little attention.

454
00:37:49.976 --> 00:37:53.229
- As I speak there are
new attacks going on.

455
00:37:53.229 --> 00:37:55.022
Against the Karen. against the Kachin.

456
00:37:55.022 --> 00:37:58.985
And over 750.000 Rohingya
chased into Bangladesh.

457
00:37:58.985 --> 00:38:01.404
This next story is playing
out with the enbattled

458
00:38:01.404 --> 00:38:04.740
Rohingya/Muslim minority in Myanmar.

459
00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:06.909
- Criminal prosecution is warranted

460
00:38:06.909 --> 00:38:09.996
in relation to genocide and war crimes.

461
00:38:24.719 --> 00:38:26.429
- We had no plan to grow.

462
00:38:26.429 --> 00:38:28.806
But step by step more people joined us

463
00:38:28.806 --> 00:38:29.890
and more people helped us.

464
00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:30.725
So we did grow.

465
00:38:32.184 --> 00:38:33.769
Leaders began to establish themselves

466
00:38:33.769 --> 00:38:35.104
for the Free Burma Rangers.

467
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:49.535
They could pretty much run
it without a lot of our help.

468
00:39:07.261 --> 00:39:09.180
While we were on a mission in Burma.

469
00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.474
I got a message by satellite saying.

470
00:39:11.474 --> 00:39:13.934
"Please come and help in Iraq."

471
00:39:22.985 --> 00:39:26.155
We had no idea what would happen next.

472
00:39:38.501 --> 00:39:39.376
Where's Sahale?

473
00:39:39.376 --> 00:39:41.545
- She's in the other room.

474
00:39:41.545 --> 00:39:43.923
- Hey honey. get your pack hun.

475
00:39:43.923 --> 00:39:45.007
Gotta roll baby.

476
00:39:45.007 --> 00:39:48.552
- So. switching gears
and leaving Burma for

477
00:39:48.552 --> 00:39:52.014
other mission opportunities
was real hard for me.

478
00:39:52.014 --> 00:39:53.808
I was settled in Burma
and I had a lot of plans

479
00:39:53.808 --> 00:39:56.227
for what I was going to do.

480
00:39:59.647 --> 00:40:02.066
And I feel god saying.
"Just stay in there Karen.

481
00:40:02.066 --> 00:40:03.192
"This is the path I have for you.

482
00:40:03.192 --> 00:40:04.693
"This is the path I have for you.

483
00:40:04.693 --> 00:40:07.822
"I'm ready to jump out anytime
and do something normal.

484
00:40:07.822 --> 00:40:10.282
"But I really feel like
that is not going to be

485
00:40:10.282 --> 00:40:11.700
"the safe place for you.

486
00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:14.453
"As crazy as it seems this path I have.

487
00:40:14.453 --> 00:40:18.082
"you and Dave. together in
unison. with your family.

488
00:40:18.082 --> 00:40:19.959
"And the plan I have.

489
00:40:19.959 --> 00:40:21.293
being consistent.

490
00:40:21.752 --> 00:40:25.673
is the safest place and the
richest place for you to live."

491
00:40:34.723 --> 00:40:37.726
- We got invited to Kurdistan. Iraq.

492
00:40:47.945 --> 00:40:50.072
ISIS killed the Yazidi's by the thousands.

493
00:40:52.241 --> 00:40:53.617
We're looking to the west at Mosul.

494
00:40:53.617 --> 00:40:54.952
Which is just right there.

495
00:40:57.246 --> 00:40:59.665
Mosul is the second biggest city in Iraq.

496
00:40:59.665 --> 00:41:01.375
It's called Nineveh in the Bible.

497
00:41:01.375 --> 00:41:02.960
It's the place Jonah went.

498
00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.837
And this city was one of the

499
00:41:04.837 --> 00:41:07.840
cities taken over by ISIS in 2014.

500
00:41:09.884 --> 00:41:11.760
At that time the Iraqi Army is just

501
00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:14.513
starting to attack Mosul to push ISIS out.

502
00:41:14.513 --> 00:41:15.764
We said. "God do you want us to go to

503
00:41:15.764 --> 00:41:17.349
"Mosul and help the Iraqi's?"

504
00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:19.143
We don't know any Iraqis.

505
00:41:19.143 --> 00:41:21.061
And we just prayed.

506
00:41:22.188 --> 00:41:23.481
An hour after that prayer.

507
00:41:23.481 --> 00:41:27.067
we got a phone call
from a big organization

508
00:41:27.067 --> 00:41:28.861
that said. "We got a lot of food.

509
00:41:28.861 --> 00:41:31.822
"but our security rules
don't allow us to deliver it

510
00:41:31.822 --> 00:41:33.699
"into the fighting areas of East Mosul.

511
00:41:33.699 --> 00:41:34.658
"Would you do it?"

512
00:41:34.658 --> 00:41:36.869
We said. "We just prayed about this.

513
00:41:36.869 --> 00:41:38.704
"Yeah we'll do it."

514
00:41:47.087 --> 00:41:50.591
Iraq. the mechanized
desert country with modern

515
00:41:50.591 --> 00:41:52.718
utilities. and services.

516
00:41:54.929 --> 00:41:56.722
You know in Burma. it's our
home. We know the people.

517
00:41:56.722 --> 00:41:58.224
We know how to work.

518
00:41:58.224 --> 00:41:59.558
We're pretty good at it.

519
00:41:59.558 --> 00:42:01.852
A lot of that's because there's
nothing to compare us to.

520
00:42:01.852 --> 00:42:02.978
We're really not that good.

521
00:42:02.978 --> 00:42:04.313
it's just that we're there.

522
00:42:06.857 --> 00:42:09.693
We don't know the Iraqi Army.

523
00:42:09.693 --> 00:42:12.363
We had no permits to get past checkpoints.

524
00:42:12.363 --> 00:42:15.032
We did not know exactly
where this place was.

525
00:42:15.032 --> 00:42:15.866
But we went.

526
00:42:26.043 --> 00:42:27.586
They normally just stop you.

527
00:42:27.586 --> 00:42:29.838
because you have no
permission to be there.

528
00:42:29.838 --> 00:42:31.799
But they just smiled and waved us through.

529
00:42:31.799 --> 00:42:33.550
This is one of the first vehicles to move

530
00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:36.178
on this road in two years.

531
00:42:36.178 --> 00:42:39.014
There's still IED's all
along the side of the road.

532
00:42:40.057 --> 00:42:42.268
We got to the edge of East Mosul.

533
00:42:42.268 --> 00:42:43.811
We turn. as soon as we started turning

534
00:42:43.811 --> 00:42:45.521
and going across this dirt open expanse.

535
00:42:45.521 --> 00:42:47.106
ISIS opened fire from our front.

536
00:42:49.066 --> 00:42:50.609
Are you filming.

537
00:42:50.609 --> 00:42:53.570
That's a mortar just
landed in front of us.

538
00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:54.405
They're hammering us.

539
00:42:54.405 --> 00:42:55.239
We were like Mr. Bean.

540
00:42:55.239 --> 00:42:56.615
We could've drove right into them.

541
00:42:56.615 --> 00:42:58.951
Iraqi flag. go towards that.

542
00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:00.786
We end up at the Iraqi Army.

543
00:43:00.786 --> 00:43:02.162
And the Iraqi Army Commander said.

544
00:43:02.162 --> 00:43:04.456
"Who are you and how did you get here?"

545
00:43:04.456 --> 00:43:07.167
I said. "God sent us here to help you.

546
00:43:07.167 --> 00:43:08.377
"Everything I have is yours.

547
00:43:08.377 --> 00:43:09.461
"How can we help you?"

548
00:43:16.093 --> 00:43:17.761
General Mustafa is an Iraqi General.

549
00:43:17.761 --> 00:43:19.888
who commanded the 36th Brigade.

550
00:43:19.888 --> 00:43:21.473
I'm describing the Free Burma Rangers.

551
00:43:21.473 --> 00:43:23.100
And how we are very small
but we want to help.

552
00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:26.729
And I'm trying to make a
good impression as well.

553
00:43:26.729 --> 00:43:30.149
And in the end I say.
you know. "Can I pray?"

554
00:43:30.149 --> 00:43:31.734
They said. "Of course."

555
00:43:31.734 --> 00:43:35.612
But then I felt God's voice or thought

556
00:43:35.612 --> 00:43:37.364
get on your knees and pray.

557
00:43:37.364 --> 00:43:39.283
I'm like get on my knees?

558
00:43:39.283 --> 00:43:41.368
I'll look like a Christian nutcase. man.

559
00:43:41.368 --> 00:43:42.202
They don't even know me.

560
00:43:42.202 --> 00:43:43.912
I'm gunna get on my
knees in front of them?

561
00:43:43.912 --> 00:43:46.957
I don't even pray on my
knees at home. you know?

562
00:43:46.957 --> 00:43:47.833
I knew that voice.

563
00:43:47.833 --> 00:43:49.084
I said okay God.

564
00:43:49.084 --> 00:43:51.670
I got on my knees and just prayed for them

565
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:52.630
and for how we could serve them.

566
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:56.383
And I got up. the Iraqi General
said. "You're just like us.

567
00:43:56.383 --> 00:43:57.843
"You know you're not God.

568
00:43:57.843 --> 00:43:59.720
"You have a fear and respect of God.

569
00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:01.764
"You know you need God and you honor him.

570
00:44:05.225 --> 00:44:08.771
"So. you can go anywhere
you want in my country."

571
00:44:08.771 --> 00:44:09.605
Wow.

572
00:44:13.025 --> 00:44:14.485
- We brought the things we had been doing

573
00:44:14.485 --> 00:44:15.903
for 20 years in Burma.

574
00:44:15.903 --> 00:44:17.696
to see how it would work there.

575
00:44:19.448 --> 00:44:20.741
- All the food and supplies.

576
00:44:20.741 --> 00:44:23.035
We took it in and delivered it.

577
00:44:23.035 --> 00:44:26.330
And developed a very close
relationship with the Iraqi Army.

578
00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:30.668
That enabled us to do work all over Mosul.

579
00:44:35.089 --> 00:44:35.923
This your family?

580
00:44:47.684 --> 00:44:49.603
- Awesome. we love you!

581
00:45:08.539 --> 00:45:10.833
Muhammed became my driver.

582
00:45:10.833 --> 00:45:13.210
When we were assigned a
Humvee with the Iraqi Army.

583
00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:14.878
He is tough as nails.

584
00:45:14.878 --> 00:45:18.340
And Shaheen. my friend. my interpreter.

585
00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:20.217
came with me from Kurdistan.

586
00:45:21.218 --> 00:45:23.345
Hilarious guy. very sarcastic.

587
00:45:26.056 --> 00:45:29.351
He drank non stop. wild
tiger. and smoked cigarettes.

588
00:45:31.854 --> 00:45:34.314
But never got tired working with us.

589
00:45:34.314 --> 00:45:36.775
We'd be very minimal in
our effect with out them.

590
00:46:01.258 --> 00:46:03.051
The Burma team members we bring.

591
00:46:03.051 --> 00:46:04.553
Are absolutely key because those are

592
00:46:04.553 --> 00:46:07.556
the qualified and skilled
medics and videographers.

593
00:46:10.893 --> 00:46:13.687
But we also have many
international volunteers

594
00:46:13.687 --> 00:46:15.647
people from the U.S. from Europe.

595
00:46:15.647 --> 00:46:16.773
All over the world.

596
00:46:16.773 --> 00:46:20.569
All come to be where
the greatest need was.

597
00:46:21.403 --> 00:46:22.988
And that was at the very front.

598
00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:28.911
I'm 57 now.

599
00:46:28.911 --> 00:46:30.454
I'm not 30 years old.

600
00:46:30.454 --> 00:46:33.373
And my running times are twice as slow

601
00:46:33.373 --> 00:46:35.083
and nothing works as well.

602
00:46:35.083 --> 00:46:37.002
But it was God's plan. just keep going.

603
00:46:59.733 --> 00:47:02.194
- We we're invited to do a kids program

604
00:47:02.194 --> 00:47:05.489
in an area that was still quite dangerous.

605
00:47:08.158 --> 00:47:12.412
- We are in Mosul. on
the outskirts of Mosul.

606
00:47:12.412 --> 00:47:15.666
And we are going to do a kids program

607
00:47:15.666 --> 00:47:17.918
for the kids around this area.

608
00:47:39.648 --> 00:47:42.401
- Hello. Hello. Hello.

609
00:47:42.401 --> 00:47:43.694
God bless you.
in Jesus' name.

610
00:47:44.611 --> 00:47:46.572
- They found a school.

611
00:47:46.572 --> 00:47:48.490
Meaning there were walls around it.

612
00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:52.494
Where it would be a closed
and easily protected venue.

613
00:47:57.624 --> 00:48:01.461
- You want to check the women. just very.

614
00:48:01.461 --> 00:48:02.880
smile and pray for them.

615
00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:05.007
Give them a good chance to pray
in Jesus name with each one.

616
00:48:05.007 --> 00:48:06.466
Check for suicide vests.

617
00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:11.847
- The whole environment was
very fragile and tenuous.

618
00:48:11.847 --> 00:48:12.973
And these people's lives.

619
00:48:12.973 --> 00:48:15.559
They had really just lost everything.

620
00:48:34.411 --> 00:48:36.955
Even the Iraqi Army had joined in.

621
00:48:36.955 --> 00:48:38.832
I think it was a real break for them.

622
00:48:38.832 --> 00:48:42.294
To be doing something fun. and then--

623
00:48:46.173 --> 00:48:48.300
We could hear explosions going off.

624
00:48:54.139 --> 00:48:56.099
You could see people's
eyebrows kind of going up

625
00:48:56.099 --> 00:48:57.184
and looking around.

626
00:49:02.814 --> 00:49:04.816
It clearly was getting closer.

627
00:49:04.816 --> 00:49:06.360
We need to finish up now.

628
00:49:08.153 --> 00:49:11.031
And we stopped whatever we were doing.

629
00:49:13.867 --> 00:49:14.701
They were not upset.

630
00:49:14.701 --> 00:49:15.911
They were not fazed.

631
00:49:15.911 --> 00:49:18.664
They actually wanted their
stuff be for they could go.

632
00:49:18.664 --> 00:49:20.666
We want our shirt and our bracelet.

633
00:49:24.336 --> 00:49:27.255
Unfortunately. the kids are used to this.

634
00:49:27.255 --> 00:49:31.969
It was new for us.

635
00:49:38.183 --> 00:49:41.061
I thought. thank god that we
were able to share with them

636
00:49:41.061 --> 00:49:42.604
something about good life.

637
00:49:43.522 --> 00:49:45.482
Before they left the door.

638
00:50:06.878 --> 00:50:08.463
It's a much more intense situation

639
00:50:08.463 --> 00:50:10.799
than I ever have been in before.

640
00:50:12.634 --> 00:50:13.844
In the back of my mind.

641
00:50:13.844 --> 00:50:16.304
I'm thinking how far is
that going to take Dave?

642
00:50:33.071 --> 00:50:34.489
- Well Lord. help them
miss with their weapons.

643
00:50:34.489 --> 00:50:36.324
Especially the RPG's.

644
00:50:39.411 --> 00:50:40.412
Thank you. Lord.

645
00:50:40.412 --> 00:50:44.416
- That was a mortar.
- That was a good miss.

646
00:50:44.416 --> 00:50:47.878
Fighting in Iraq was different
than Burma. the scale of it.

647
00:50:48.712 --> 00:50:52.257
Tanks. anti-tanks systems.
aircraft. helicopters.

648
00:50:52.257 --> 00:50:55.969
ISIS was very well armed.

649
00:50:55.969 --> 00:50:57.763
The volume of fire was incredible.

650
00:50:59.556 --> 00:51:01.808
I think probably any given day in Mosul

651
00:51:01.808 --> 00:51:06.730
more shooting happened
than any year in Burma.

652
00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:10.233
In the first few months.

653
00:51:10.233 --> 00:51:12.778
we're with the Iraqi Army
pushing forward to Mosul.

654
00:51:14.112 --> 00:51:16.072
We're right behind the leading element.

655
00:51:17.407 --> 00:51:19.367
We want to document what was happening.

656
00:51:20.327 --> 00:51:22.245
And were taking care of causalities.

657
00:51:25.707 --> 00:51:27.209
And this went on and on and on and on.

658
00:51:27.209 --> 00:51:28.418
Month after month.

659
00:51:28.418 --> 00:51:29.753
And people were fleeing all the time.

660
00:51:29.753 --> 00:51:30.879
just trying to get out.

661
00:51:36.468 --> 00:51:38.136
No matter the obstacles or danger.

662
00:51:38.136 --> 00:51:39.387
We knew we had to help.

663
00:51:40.555 --> 00:51:41.890
Alive!

664
00:53:22.115 --> 00:53:23.116
All right. Dave Eubank.

665
00:53:23.116 --> 00:53:24.826
Free Burma. Free Kurd Rangers.

666
00:53:25.744 --> 00:53:29.247
We're going to a town that ISIS
has held for two years now.

667
00:53:29.247 --> 00:53:32.125
to be part of the group that liberates it.

668
00:53:32.125 --> 00:53:33.376
All in Jesus name.

669
00:53:33.376 --> 00:53:36.213
And thank you for all your
help and support and prayers.

670
00:53:43.345 --> 00:53:45.513
When we were in Mosul.

671
00:53:45.513 --> 00:53:47.766
And the campaign all around Mosul.

672
00:53:47.766 --> 00:53:50.101
The Iraqi Army had
liberated a farming area

673
00:53:50.101 --> 00:53:51.561
with three families.

674
00:53:51.561 --> 00:53:53.355
And as we went down there.

675
00:53:53.355 --> 00:53:54.856
the people were first afraid of us.

676
00:53:54.856 --> 00:53:56.691
And then we told them we
were there to help them.

677
00:53:56.691 --> 00:53:58.526
And the started hugging us.

678
00:53:58.526 --> 00:54:01.279
Hello. God bless you in Jesus name.

679
00:54:01.279 --> 00:54:02.697
God bless you in Jesus name.

680
00:54:06.368 --> 00:54:08.954
This is the first liberated
village we've come to.

681
00:54:08.954 --> 00:54:10.413
What's the name of this place?

682
00:54:12.082 --> 00:54:13.541
I prayed with them.

683
00:54:13.541 --> 00:54:16.211
And they were so happy. I was happy.

684
00:54:16.211 --> 00:54:18.213
And this little three year old
girl's grabbing my pant leg.

685
00:54:18.213 --> 00:54:19.589
America America.

686
00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:20.799
I turned to Monkey and I said.

687
00:54:20.799 --> 00:54:22.801
"Monkey. this is the best day
of this whole operation man.

688
00:54:22.801 --> 00:54:24.844
"We got to be apart of liberating people."

689
00:54:24.844 --> 00:54:26.221
He goes. "Yes".

690
00:54:26.221 --> 00:54:27.389
Family load up in the tractor.

691
00:54:27.389 --> 00:54:29.391
They drive out towards their relatives.

692
00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:32.519
What they don't know
is when ISIS retreated

693
00:54:32.519 --> 00:54:33.937
they laid land mines.

694
00:54:33.937 --> 00:54:35.188
They blew the whole family up.

695
00:54:38.733 --> 00:54:39.859
Right in our sight.

696
00:54:39.859 --> 00:54:41.736
You could see it about 300 yards away.

697
00:55:25.447 --> 00:55:28.283
I see one of my medics
working on this little girl.

698
00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:31.911
I'm praying Jesus. save this girl.

699
00:55:36.333 --> 00:55:37.417
She dies right there.

700
00:55:39.335 --> 00:55:41.296
Same one who had just been hugging my leg.

701
00:55:41.296 --> 00:55:43.381
The same one that was part
of that beautiful day.

702
00:55:43.381 --> 00:55:44.215
Gone.

703
00:55:54.184 --> 00:55:57.020
We evacuated the wounded
the best we could.

704
00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:58.063
And I turned to Monkey.

705
00:55:58.063 --> 00:56:00.607
And I said. "Monkey. that's it man.

706
00:56:00.607 --> 00:56:02.650
"We're gonna hunt down ISIS from now on."

707
00:56:04.402 --> 00:56:06.863
This is why.

708
00:56:06.863 --> 00:56:08.406
The reason we fight ISIS.

709
00:56:13.578 --> 00:56:15.163
Is because of this.

710
00:56:15.163 --> 00:56:16.539
Killed that little kid.

711
00:56:16.539 --> 00:56:17.457
Blew up the family.

712
00:56:18.917 --> 00:56:20.168
People who do that.

713
00:56:20.168 --> 00:56:21.628
You have to kill them until they decide

714
00:56:21.628 --> 00:56:22.462
they're not going to do it.

715
00:56:22.462 --> 00:56:24.214
And we pray for them to surrender.

716
00:56:25.298 --> 00:56:26.883
But when they stand and do that.

717
00:56:27.926 --> 00:56:32.097
Then they have chosen to die.

718
00:56:32.097 --> 00:56:33.348
We are going to share the gospel of Jesus.

719
00:56:33.348 --> 00:56:34.933
We are going to give
food and medical care.

720
00:56:34.933 --> 00:56:36.309
But I can't live with myself.

721
00:56:36.309 --> 00:56:38.103
Letting this happen again
and again and again.

722
00:56:38.103 --> 00:56:39.896
And we're not the answer to the problem.

723
00:56:39.896 --> 00:56:42.232
But we're going to go after
it. And that's justice.

724
00:56:42.232 --> 00:56:43.691
What do you think?
He said.

725
00:56:43.691 --> 00:56:44.526
I think it's right.

726
00:56:44.526 --> 00:56:45.360
Let's ask God.

727
00:57:03.461 --> 00:57:05.338
So. that night I said. "Lord
Jesus. show me the truth

728
00:57:05.338 --> 00:57:06.589
"of what happened today."

729
00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:10.135
Open my Kindle up to the Bible.

730
00:57:10.135 --> 00:57:11.136
And I put my finger.

731
00:57:11.136 --> 00:57:12.804
And it said. "Vengeance
is mine said the Lord.

732
00:57:12.804 --> 00:57:13.847
"I will repay."

733
00:57:14.848 --> 00:57:16.307
Vengeance.

734
00:57:16.307 --> 00:57:18.768
Oh. what I thought was
justice was Vengeance.

735
00:57:36.035 --> 00:57:39.247
Vengeance. looks like justice.

736
00:57:39.247 --> 00:57:41.082
But is driven by hate.

737
00:57:41.082 --> 00:57:42.458
It starts in the same place.

738
00:57:42.458 --> 00:57:44.836
An injustice had been done.

739
00:57:44.836 --> 00:57:46.629
What are you going to do about it.

740
00:57:46.629 --> 00:57:49.257
To get justice requires you to approach

741
00:57:49.257 --> 00:57:53.094
that in just act with
love for the perpetrator

742
00:57:53.094 --> 00:57:56.347
and the person who's hurt. and mercy.

743
00:57:56.347 --> 00:57:57.891
There's a place for punishment too.

744
00:57:57.891 --> 00:58:00.226
But it will be done. and enforcement.

745
00:58:00.226 --> 00:58:02.395
But it will be done in the spirit of love.

746
00:58:02.395 --> 00:58:03.480
Which is very different.

747
00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:06.065
What's the best for both these people?

748
00:58:06.065 --> 00:58:07.817
And I said. "Jesus. forgive me."

749
00:58:07.817 --> 00:58:10.945
and "I reject vengeance."
And he took it away from me.

750
00:58:10.945 --> 00:58:13.948
And it was a huge crushing wait on me.

751
00:58:13.948 --> 00:58:16.492
but I could not feel it
until it was lifted off.

752
00:58:20.663 --> 00:58:23.082
If I had kept that that
would of warped me.

753
00:58:23.082 --> 00:58:24.042
But I'm light and free.

754
00:58:24.042 --> 00:58:25.627
I don't have to fight anybody.

755
00:58:25.627 --> 00:58:27.295
I don't have to kill anybody.

756
00:58:27.295 --> 00:58:28.838
I don't have to bring any justice.

757
00:58:28.838 --> 00:58:31.132
I just got to obey Jesus.
That's all I got to do.

758
00:58:31.132 --> 00:58:33.051
I'll be his servant. his ambassador.

759
00:58:42.143 --> 00:58:43.269
- That kicks.

760
00:58:51.945 --> 00:58:53.947
- My parents they love us a lot.

761
00:58:53.947 --> 00:58:55.698
And they believe that our upbringing

762
00:58:55.698 --> 00:58:56.950
and what we've done growing up

763
00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:58.993
is the best thing that they can offer us.

764
00:59:05.917 --> 00:59:08.086
- My mom and dad gave
me this amazing life.

765
00:59:12.173 --> 00:59:13.258
He's also very bold.

766
00:59:13.258 --> 00:59:16.135
He would always tell me be
bold in the things of Jesus.

767
00:59:16.135 --> 00:59:18.012
And humble in the things of yourself.

768
00:59:21.808 --> 00:59:26.229
- We'd probably be in a boarding
school without them alone.

769
00:59:26.229 --> 00:59:27.647
He started bucking.

770
00:59:27.647 --> 00:59:30.108
Not being able to do half
of the things that we did.

771
00:59:30.108 --> 00:59:33.236
Or learn half of the
things that we've learned.

772
00:59:33.236 --> 00:59:35.780
Like humility and hospitality.

773
00:59:39.117 --> 00:59:42.328
- Most of the time I just
thank God that I am still alive

774
00:59:42.328 --> 00:59:45.248
and running around and
having fun on this Earth.

775
01:00:02.348 --> 01:00:05.852
- We know that this is a big war.

776
01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:07.353
We knew they were going to where the

777
01:00:07.353 --> 01:00:09.397
explosions were the greatest.

778
01:00:09.397 --> 01:00:10.481
Because that was the point.

779
01:00:10.481 --> 01:00:12.233
That they're going to the conflict.

780
01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:18.239
I remember praying. "Lord.
help them to accomplish

781
01:00:18.239 --> 01:00:19.741
as much as possible."

782
01:00:46.476 --> 01:00:48.686
- I've had doubts come
and go and questions.

783
01:00:50.229 --> 01:00:52.190
I don't want to disobey you Lord.

784
01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:54.567
so. I'm going to ask
you "What should I do?"

785
01:00:54.567 --> 01:00:55.735
"Lord. what do I do?"

786
01:00:58.321 --> 01:00:59.489
No matter what it costs.

787
01:01:13.461 --> 01:01:17.507
In Mosul. at the end of May. ISIS is along

788
01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:18.925
with shooting Iraqi soldiers.

789
01:01:18.925 --> 01:01:20.968
they're shooting civilians.

790
01:01:20.968 --> 01:01:24.138
And there was a fatwa put out
by one of the ISIS groups.

791
01:01:24.138 --> 01:01:28.101
It said. "Better to kill your own family

792
01:01:28.101 --> 01:01:29.310
"than let them escape.

793
01:01:29.310 --> 01:01:30.728
"The highest act of love is to kill

794
01:01:30.728 --> 01:01:31.604
your own wife and children

795
01:01:31.604 --> 01:01:32.897
"than let them fall in the hands of the

796
01:01:32.897 --> 01:01:34.857
"Iraqi's and the infidels."

797
01:01:34.857 --> 01:01:35.692
Wow.

798
01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.158
These are people fleeing.

799
01:01:44.158 --> 01:01:45.159
Streaming out.

800
01:01:45.159 --> 01:01:46.577
They said they had to hide from ISIS.

801
01:01:46.577 --> 01:01:48.621
Who try to block them.

802
01:01:48.621 --> 01:01:51.457
And they're making a run for it now.

803
01:01:52.625 --> 01:01:54.127
So. more people are
getting shot as they're

804
01:01:54.127 --> 01:01:54.961
trying to flee ISIS.

805
01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:56.295
Some are ISIS families directly.

806
01:01:56.295 --> 01:01:57.797
Some are just people
who have been under ISIS

807
01:01:57.797 --> 01:01:59.632
and now is their chance to break free.

808
01:02:21.654 --> 01:02:23.489
We were trying to rescue families.

809
01:02:23.489 --> 01:02:26.701
By going into an ISIS controlled
area and taking people out.

810
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:30.621
Civilians three years. trapped by ISIS.

811
01:02:30.621 --> 01:02:32.582
Every time we busted into a new place.

812
01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:34.876
we see a hole in the wall
and people hiding underneath.

813
01:02:34.876 --> 01:02:36.711
Civilians would come fleeing.

814
01:02:36.711 --> 01:02:38.045
Handing us babies.

815
01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:54.145
We ran into more and more resistance.

816
01:02:54.145 --> 01:02:55.646
And we were stopped on the street

817
01:02:55.646 --> 01:02:57.190
about three or four in the afternoon.

818
01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:59.901
And we got so much fire. we
couldn't push any further.

819
01:03:05.948 --> 01:03:07.658
Hussein went out in the street

820
01:03:07.658 --> 01:03:08.868
and I went out there with him.

821
01:03:10.745 --> 01:03:12.830
Within seconds I'm looking this way.

822
01:03:12.830 --> 01:03:14.791
I heard gunshots this way.

823
01:03:19.003 --> 01:03:21.756
Seven yards away I see three ISIS.

824
01:03:21.756 --> 01:03:23.382
They've been watching us.

825
01:03:23.382 --> 01:03:24.425
Shot me once in the arm.

826
01:03:24.425 --> 01:03:25.885
Two hit my helmet.

827
01:03:29.388 --> 01:03:32.099
Brought my rifle up and started shooting.

828
01:03:32.099 --> 01:03:33.392
And I said. "God help me."

829
01:03:34.393 --> 01:03:36.395
Hussein was shot six times.

830
01:03:38.272 --> 01:03:42.818
- Hand grenade.

831
01:03:58.918 --> 01:04:01.629
- This is my good doctor friend. Obed.

832
01:04:01.629 --> 01:04:02.463
Patching me up.

833
01:04:04.382 --> 01:04:05.341
I'm very fortunate.

834
01:04:17.812 --> 01:04:19.480
What do we gotta do?

835
01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:22.275
Can we find another way?

836
01:04:29.865 --> 01:04:31.158
A lot of us had near misses.

837
01:04:31.158 --> 01:04:32.451
Our vehicles were shot up.

838
01:04:33.869 --> 01:04:34.954
And we're looking at our vehicle.

839
01:04:34.954 --> 01:04:38.082
I open the hood up and I see
transmission shot to pieces.

840
01:04:38.082 --> 01:04:39.041
I ask an Iraqi soldier.

841
01:04:39.041 --> 01:04:40.209
"You think I can drive this thing still?"

842
01:04:40.209 --> 01:04:41.043
Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.

843
01:04:41.043 --> 01:04:41.878
We'll fix that later.

844
01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:43.504
Okay. and I check it and it moves.

845
01:04:44.422 --> 01:04:46.716
And we're looking at.
you know. what we can do.

846
01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:48.175
And we move the casualties out.

847
01:04:48.175 --> 01:04:49.176
And all of a sudden an Iraqi soldier

848
01:04:49.176 --> 01:04:50.094
comes running over the hill.

849
01:04:50.094 --> 01:04:51.012
This little hill.

850
01:04:51.012 --> 01:04:52.889
They just killed a family in the street.

851
01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:54.223
Help. somebody help!

852
01:05:01.188 --> 01:05:02.982
There's a mother shot in the street.

853
01:05:04.567 --> 01:05:06.944
There's a father rolling
around shot in the leg.

854
01:05:15.077 --> 01:05:16.787
ISIS just opens up on three sides.

855
01:05:16.787 --> 01:05:19.081
Bullets are pinging off
the Humvee like crazy.

856
01:05:20.958 --> 01:05:22.501
Bullets just miss me.

857
01:05:22.501 --> 01:05:23.920
I jump in the passenger seat.

858
01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.255
Go. go. go. back up.

859
01:05:26.255 --> 01:05:27.506
The vehicle won't go backwards.

860
01:05:27.506 --> 01:05:29.925
because the transmission is too shot.

861
01:05:35.973 --> 01:05:38.351
And ISIS is shooting our vehicle apart.

862
01:05:50.696 --> 01:05:52.365
At that moment Muhammed
is sitting across from me

863
01:05:52.365 --> 01:05:54.325
and he goes. "I'm gonna
get help." And I said no!

864
01:05:54.325 --> 01:05:55.493
Let me call on the radio.

865
01:05:55.493 --> 01:05:56.702
But I can't stop Muhammed.

866
01:05:56.702 --> 01:05:58.746
Muhammed jumps out and
runs through a hail of fire.

867
01:05:58.746 --> 01:06:00.706
Muhammed brings another Humvee.

868
01:06:00.706 --> 01:06:03.626
Drives around the safe side of us.

869
01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:05.711
Shaheen's getting out so
we can get the shot girl

870
01:06:05.711 --> 01:06:06.754
and the father out.

871
01:06:12.426 --> 01:06:15.638
Shaheen's shot in the stomach
and just falls to the ground.

872
01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:17.306
You can hear that cry of the soul.

873
01:06:21.686 --> 01:06:24.271
And I see Muhammed run.

874
01:06:24.271 --> 01:06:26.357
Grab Shaheen and drag him to his Humvee.

875
01:06:26.357 --> 01:06:29.360
And Muhammed gets shot
eight times doing that.

876
01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:31.237
Finally. an Abrams tank
comes up next to us.

877
01:06:31.237 --> 01:06:32.154
From the Iraqis.

878
01:06:34.281 --> 01:06:37.284
And just starts blasting ISIS point blank.

879
01:06:37.284 --> 01:06:40.788
And then an Iraqi soldier and Justin

880
01:06:40.788 --> 01:06:42.957
used the tank as a
shield. and pull us out.

881
01:07:04.729 --> 01:07:06.772
Eight days later I call Shaheen.

882
01:07:06.772 --> 01:07:08.274
I said. "How are you?"

883
01:07:08.274 --> 01:07:10.651
He's like. "I'll be okay. don't let

884
01:07:10.651 --> 01:07:11.986
"them take all your
money to take care of me.

885
01:07:11.986 --> 01:07:13.571
"They're gonna cheat you man. "

886
01:07:13.571 --> 01:07:15.239
I said we'll take care of you.

887
01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:20.077
Two days later he was dead.

888
01:07:21.454 --> 01:07:22.288
Had an infection.

889
01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:37.011
That hurt my heart.

890
01:07:38.554 --> 01:07:40.014
And I just broke down.

891
01:07:40.014 --> 01:07:40.973
I missed him a lot.

892
01:07:42.266 --> 01:07:45.853
Because Shaheen was
not just my translator.

893
01:07:47.104 --> 01:07:48.355
He became like a brother.

894
01:07:51.609 --> 01:07:56.614
Shaheen represents to me.
the best of being human.

895
01:07:58.407 --> 01:08:01.952
We have a man. a Yazidi. who
was persecutor on all sides.

896
01:08:01.952 --> 01:08:03.662
But gave his life. he didn't want to die.

897
01:08:03.662 --> 01:08:05.122
But he put it out there
to help someone else.

898
01:08:05.122 --> 01:08:08.375
To help a little kid and her father. live.

899
01:08:12.505 --> 01:08:13.672
Muhammed's alive.

900
01:08:13.672 --> 01:08:14.507
Muhammed. how are you?

901
01:08:14.507 --> 01:08:16.592
I'm very sad about Shaheen.

902
01:08:16.592 --> 01:08:17.718
I said. "You did your best man.

903
01:08:17.718 --> 01:08:18.552
"How are you?

904
01:08:18.552 --> 01:08:19.637
"Shot eight times."

905
01:09:23.617 --> 01:09:25.494
Shaheen died. he lived.

906
01:09:25.494 --> 01:09:26.412
I don't know why.

907
01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:27.246
I don't know how.

908
01:09:29.415 --> 01:09:30.416
Maybe God help me.

909
01:09:32.418 --> 01:09:33.794
I don't understand.

910
01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:20.257
- All good?

911
01:10:22.384 --> 01:10:23.969
Hey. where are you?

912
01:10:29.141 --> 01:10:32.603
- When I look around it's just despairing.

913
01:10:32.603 --> 01:10:35.230
But I know Jesus has promised things

914
01:10:35.230 --> 01:10:37.816
that are better than the reality you see.

915
01:10:37.816 --> 01:10:39.860
And so we have to live on those promises.

916
01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:41.445
And if you can't rely on that promise.

917
01:10:41.445 --> 01:10:42.363
what is there to rely on?

918
01:10:42.363 --> 01:10:45.491
There's no human answer
that's going to get you

919
01:10:45.491 --> 01:10:46.533
through the next day.

920
01:10:58.587 --> 01:11:00.297
- Well. you have one life.

921
01:11:00.297 --> 01:11:03.092
and you might as well go for it.

922
01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:04.426
Because what are you going to hold on to?

923
01:11:04.426 --> 01:11:07.262
You're going to loose
your life one day anyway.

924
01:11:07.262 --> 01:11:11.433
So. saying yes. is God all the
good things you have for us.

925
01:11:11.433 --> 01:11:12.685
I want them.

926
01:11:12.685 --> 01:11:16.313
And anything useful to do that I can do.

927
01:11:16.313 --> 01:11:17.773
I would like to do it.

928
01:11:17.773 --> 01:11:20.109
So. I'll say yes.

929
01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:24.780
And I want to say no to the
swamp of sin on one side

930
01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:26.198
that gets me bogged down.

931
01:11:26.198 --> 01:11:28.993
And no to the swamp of good things to do.

932
01:11:28.993 --> 01:11:32.162
Christian things to do that
God didn't ask me to do.

933
01:11:32.162 --> 01:11:33.497
That also will bog me down.

934
01:11:34.331 --> 01:11:38.669
And I want to say yes to
that line that God has.

935
01:11:38.669 --> 01:11:41.171
Which I believe has no caution lights.

936
01:11:41.171 --> 01:11:42.881
Its green. go man.

937
01:11:42.881 --> 01:11:44.425
As fast as you want to go.

938
01:11:44.425 --> 01:11:45.384
How much faith do you have?

939
01:11:45.384 --> 01:11:46.844
Go!

940
01:11:46.844 --> 01:11:48.095
That's what I want to do.

941
01:11:53.934 --> 01:11:56.020
- We are going down to the front line.

942
01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:57.938
- Going through the city.

943
01:11:57.938 --> 01:11:59.773
Finding people who need help.

944
01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:47.363
- Against the far wall
there were living people.

945
01:12:51.909 --> 01:12:53.368
There was a guy who was shot.

946
01:12:53.368 --> 01:12:56.121
And then there was three little kids

947
01:12:56.121 --> 01:12:57.748
playing among in the dead bodies.

948
01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:02.753
One girl kind of sat
next to her dead mother.

949
01:13:02.753 --> 01:13:04.713
Kept hiding under her dead mom's scarf.

950
01:13:13.931 --> 01:13:16.016
If you take one on the street
you're getting shot at.

951
01:13:16.016 --> 01:13:17.309
If you drive an armored vehicle.

952
01:13:17.309 --> 01:13:19.269
it's going to get blown up.

953
01:13:19.269 --> 01:13:20.771
You go near that you're dead.

954
01:13:22.606 --> 01:13:24.066
How can we help these people?

955
01:13:26.235 --> 01:13:27.069
And I pray.

956
01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:28.654
And this first comes to me.

957
01:13:28.654 --> 01:13:29.988
"greater love that no man than this.

958
01:13:29.988 --> 01:13:31.115
"than he lay down his life for his friends."

959
01:13:31.115 --> 01:13:32.991
And I say. "God do you want me to do that?

960
01:13:32.991 --> 01:13:33.867
"It's for love."

961
01:13:34.868 --> 01:13:36.495
I don't want to do it.

962
01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:39.414
I sent out a message right away.

963
01:13:39.414 --> 01:13:41.500
Saying. "Please pray.
how can we help them?"

964
01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:43.168
People started praying all over the world.

965
01:13:43.168 --> 01:13:44.420
- Dave said we don't know what to do.

966
01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:48.132
It's much more serious than
anything I've ever seen before.

967
01:13:50.467 --> 01:13:52.970
And a guy calls me from Thailand.

968
01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:53.804
One of my Chaplains.

969
01:13:53.804 --> 01:13:56.223
He says. "Dave I saw the
texts and the photos.

970
01:13:56.223 --> 01:13:57.266
"I'm praying for you."

971
01:13:57.266 --> 01:14:00.435
When he said that. I felt this infusion.

972
01:14:00.435 --> 01:14:02.146
I think of God's spirit.

973
01:14:02.146 --> 01:14:03.355
They need help.

974
01:14:03.355 --> 01:14:06.024
I need to be willing to lay
my life down to help them.

975
01:14:06.024 --> 01:14:07.317
So. I called my American friends.

976
01:14:07.317 --> 01:14:10.237
I said. "Can you help
give us smoke to obscure?"

977
01:14:10.237 --> 01:14:12.489
And I'll get the Iraqi's
to bring tanks up.

978
01:14:12.489 --> 01:14:13.323
Yes.

979
01:14:14.992 --> 01:14:16.618
And they just started dropping smoke.

980
01:14:24.209 --> 01:14:25.752
By now the two kids have been out.

981
01:14:25.752 --> 01:14:27.212
Kind of in and out and they're dead.

982
01:14:27.212 --> 01:14:28.297
But that little girl.

983
01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:31.592
The angle is such that ISIS
couldn't quite shoot her.

984
01:14:31.592 --> 01:14:32.551
I ask the Iraqi Commander.

985
01:14:32.551 --> 01:14:33.385
Please come and look.

986
01:14:33.385 --> 01:14:34.261
And he looks and I said.

987
01:14:34.261 --> 01:14:36.597
"Look there's enough
smoke. you could do it."

988
01:14:36.597 --> 01:14:38.599
He goes. okay you get one tank.

989
01:14:38.599 --> 01:14:40.350
Right now take it or leave it.

990
01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:41.185
Okay. we take it.

991
01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:46.190
Who would go with me?

992
01:14:47.858 --> 01:14:50.444
Are you willing to die trying to help

993
01:14:50.444 --> 01:14:52.488
someone that looks impossible to save.

994
01:15:10.464 --> 01:15:11.798
The tank was trying to get in position

995
01:15:11.798 --> 01:15:13.467
to make it over the obstacles.

996
01:15:13.467 --> 01:15:15.427
The Americans are still dropping smoke.

997
01:15:16.511 --> 01:15:17.346
We get prepared.

998
01:15:18.514 --> 01:15:19.973
And as soon as I saw the tank.

999
01:15:19.973 --> 01:15:21.391
I knew it was time to go.

1000
01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:25.896
Because I am trying to
save this little girl.

1001
01:15:27.147 --> 01:15:28.232
Jesus help me.

1002
01:15:31.735 --> 01:15:33.195
Whoever wants to go go.

1003
01:16:07.437 --> 01:16:09.064
I felt so terrified.

1004
01:16:09.064 --> 01:16:10.148
Terror and commitment.

1005
01:16:19.074 --> 01:16:21.577
The smoke starts to dissipate.

1006
01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:27.833
And I'm on my phone and
call the battle captain.

1007
01:16:31.128 --> 01:16:32.879
Give me more smoke please.

1008
01:16:32.879 --> 01:16:34.548
Otherwise. the tank will get blown up.

1009
01:16:34.548 --> 01:16:38.051
We'll be dead and the people will be dead.

1010
01:16:38.051 --> 01:16:40.345
And they just started dropping smoke.

1011
01:16:40.345 --> 01:16:42.180
Right on target.

1012
01:16:44.099 --> 01:16:45.809
The Iraqi's kept firing.

1013
01:16:47.144 --> 01:16:48.604
And I looked out and I thought

1014
01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:52.899
we're risking loosing everything
to save a little girl.

1015
01:16:57.362 --> 01:16:59.406
I just said. is this the right time Lord?

1016
01:17:00.365 --> 01:17:02.659
Yes. okay.

1017
01:17:11.209 --> 01:17:12.044
And I just ran.

1018
01:17:24.097 --> 01:17:25.349
And I had her.

1019
01:17:34.858 --> 01:17:37.027
I can't believe I'm alive.

1020
01:17:42.157 --> 01:17:43.367
There's two more men there.

1021
01:17:43.367 --> 01:17:44.201
Alive still.

1022
01:17:55.837 --> 01:17:59.758
And we pull the two guys
back. behind the tank.

1023
01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:05.263
The tanks taking more fire
and starting to back up now.

1024
01:18:07.474 --> 01:18:10.811
At that moment one of the men.
Ephraim. gets shot in the leg.

1025
01:18:10.811 --> 01:18:12.562
By ISIS. right through the calf.

1026
01:18:18.735 --> 01:18:19.986
I'm holding the girl.

1027
01:18:19.986 --> 01:18:21.488
Trying to shield her with my body.

1028
01:18:21.488 --> 01:18:23.198
Running. praying.

1029
01:18:23.198 --> 01:18:24.449
In Jesus name. God help.

1030
01:18:25.909 --> 01:18:28.954
And finally the Humvee comes.

1031
01:18:30.914 --> 01:18:32.958
We put everybody in. I get in.

1032
01:18:32.958 --> 01:18:34.668
Slam the doors and we drive just 40 yards.

1033
01:18:34.668 --> 01:18:36.128
And we're out of the fire.

1034
01:18:40.006 --> 01:18:41.716
- Dave called and he said meet me

1035
01:18:41.716 --> 01:18:43.427
at the casualty collection point.

1036
01:18:48.265 --> 01:18:51.059
We got there. and I'm
not a medical person.

1037
01:18:51.059 --> 01:18:53.603
So. I really don't always know what

1038
01:18:53.603 --> 01:18:55.564
to do in those situations.

1039
01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:58.483
But here was a little
girl sitting by herself.

1040
01:18:58.483 --> 01:19:01.611
And as a mom. I definitely
knew what to do then.

1041
01:19:01.611 --> 01:19:04.322
So. I just picked her up
and held her really tight.

1042
01:19:04.322 --> 01:19:05.740
And then she fell asleep.

1043
01:19:11.288 --> 01:19:12.122
It's not done.

1044
01:19:13.165 --> 01:19:17.127
There were more people inside
a building ISIS controlled.

1045
01:19:17.127 --> 01:19:18.670
This complex.

1046
01:19:18.670 --> 01:19:19.755
And after first the rescue.

1047
01:19:19.755 --> 01:19:22.340
The people in the building.
one lady who'd been shot.

1048
01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:23.675
three days now laying there shot.

1049
01:19:23.675 --> 01:19:25.177
No water. just --

1050
01:19:25.177 --> 01:19:26.803
Called on the phone to the Iraqi Army.

1051
01:19:26.803 --> 01:19:28.054
Said. "I'm still alive.

1052
01:19:28.054 --> 01:19:29.681
"There's probably four
or five of us still alive

1053
01:19:29.681 --> 01:19:32.267
"among the 150 dead people.

1054
01:19:32.267 --> 01:19:33.643
"We're in ISIS building

1055
01:19:33.643 --> 01:19:36.438
"but we saw the rescue through the crack.

1056
01:19:37.981 --> 01:19:39.566
"It happened 50 yards from us.

1057
01:19:40.817 --> 01:19:42.736
"Please come get us."

1058
01:19:42.736 --> 01:19:44.863
I was like no way. how are we gonna do it?

1059
01:19:47.991 --> 01:19:49.034
We climbed this wall.

1060
01:19:49.951 --> 01:19:51.036
And we're in.

1061
01:20:14.059 --> 01:20:15.435
We're creeping in quite and

1062
01:20:15.435 --> 01:20:17.604
all of a sudden we come to
this big open room about

1063
01:20:17.604 --> 01:20:19.147
the size of a basketball court.

1064
01:20:20.106 --> 01:20:21.608
The walls we're partially collapsed.

1065
01:20:21.608 --> 01:20:23.568
The roof had holes in it.

1066
01:20:25.195 --> 01:20:26.029
And there were cans.

1067
01:20:26.029 --> 01:20:28.865
About three feet high
as far as you could see.

1068
01:20:28.865 --> 01:20:31.243
And I thought. God you've
got to be kidding me.

1069
01:20:32.118 --> 01:20:33.662
We got to go quietly through that?

1070
01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:34.496
Impossible.

1071
01:20:35.705 --> 01:20:36.957
It'll mean they'll know where we are at.

1072
01:20:36.957 --> 01:20:39.042
And all of them can come and slaughter us.

1073
01:20:41.628 --> 01:20:43.213
This was so bad.

1074
01:20:43.213 --> 01:20:45.674
I just felt stripped of everything.

1075
01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:48.760
We had no hope and I'm afraid.

1076
01:20:52.055 --> 01:20:54.683
I never said this in my whole
life in a situation like this.

1077
01:20:57.894 --> 01:20:59.437
And then I thought.
well God is the God that

1078
01:20:59.437 --> 01:21:01.314
parted the Red Sea or he's not.

1079
01:21:01.314 --> 01:21:02.858
And he's the one that brought the walls of

1080
01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:04.150
Jericho down or he's not.

1081
01:21:05.151 --> 01:21:07.487
So. I said in Jesus name. "In Jesus name.

1082
01:21:07.487 --> 01:21:09.406
"Satan and demons. back off."

1083
01:21:11.157 --> 01:21:11.992
Back off.

1084
01:21:13.243 --> 01:21:15.120
ISIS you cannot see. hear. or stop us.

1085
01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:16.580
And not only hear.
through this whole rescue.

1086
01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:18.873
you have no authority and way to stop us.

1087
01:21:18.873 --> 01:21:20.041
And I explain that in Jesus name.

1088
01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:22.586
If you don't like it talk to Jesus.

1089
01:21:22.586 --> 01:21:23.420
That's his command.

1090
01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:25.839
That's his authority and we're behind him.

1091
01:21:25.839 --> 01:21:27.716
And we went across.

1092
01:21:39.394 --> 01:21:40.979
And I felt a growing confidence.

1093
01:21:40.979 --> 01:21:43.148
Not in me. but that God was with us.

1094
01:22:06.212 --> 01:22:09.466
We got through. and we found
one guy shot in the leg.

1095
01:22:09.466 --> 01:22:10.634
He was terrified when we came in.

1096
01:22:10.634 --> 01:22:12.427
He thought we were ISIS.

1097
01:22:12.427 --> 01:22:15.889
And there was a woman on her
stomach who'd made the call.

1098
01:22:15.889 --> 01:22:17.682
Help. and she'd been shot
in the leg three days now.

1099
01:22:17.682 --> 01:22:19.309
Shot in the leg.

1100
01:22:19.309 --> 01:22:21.895
And then her disabled
son about 13 years old.

1101
01:22:21.895 --> 01:22:23.647
And right across from
him was a little girl.

1102
01:22:23.647 --> 01:22:25.273
about six years old.

1103
01:22:25.273 --> 01:22:28.026
And I just prayed. Jesus help her.

1104
01:22:28.026 --> 01:22:30.987
Don't worry. We love you
and we're here to help you.

1105
01:22:30.987 --> 01:22:31.821
We got to get them out now.

1106
01:22:31.821 --> 01:22:34.157
It's gonna probably take us
two hours to carry them out.

1107
01:22:37.577 --> 01:22:39.829
Right then I look out in the street

1108
01:22:39.829 --> 01:22:41.915
and in the rumble in the street.

1109
01:22:41.915 --> 01:22:44.417
three dead people but one person moved.

1110
01:22:46.044 --> 01:22:48.046
I can see it was a woman.

1111
01:22:48.046 --> 01:22:49.381
I can see she'd been shot through the legs

1112
01:22:49.381 --> 01:22:50.215
about 30 yards away.

1113
01:22:50.215 --> 01:22:51.549
And she goes like this.

1114
01:22:51.549 --> 01:22:52.634
I don't know what she said in Arabic.

1115
01:22:52.634 --> 01:22:53.802
But I knew the meaning.

1116
01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:54.636
Help me.

1117
01:22:55.929 --> 01:22:57.514
And my heart sank.

1118
01:22:57.514 --> 01:22:59.099
I just wanted to get out of there.

1119
01:22:59.099 --> 01:23:01.101
I thought. no way we can help her.

1120
01:23:01.101 --> 01:23:03.603
I said. God just take
her life. have mercy.

1121
01:23:03.603 --> 01:23:06.272
Three days shot. no water.

1122
01:23:06.272 --> 01:23:08.233
Three days. not shot. no
water. in 100 something degrees

1123
01:23:08.233 --> 01:23:09.317
in Iraq. you should be dead.

1124
01:23:09.317 --> 01:23:10.694
Maybe in two days.

1125
01:23:10.694 --> 01:23:14.364
Three days. no water. shot in the leg.

1126
01:23:14.364 --> 01:23:15.657
She's alive?

1127
01:23:15.657 --> 01:23:16.992
If we go out to help her.

1128
01:23:16.992 --> 01:23:19.077
ISIS will know now we're
right there in front of them.

1129
01:23:19.077 --> 01:23:20.453
They'll know. they'll kill us.

1130
01:23:20.453 --> 01:23:21.287
They'll kill her.

1131
01:23:21.287 --> 01:23:23.540
They'll come right in that
building kill that little kid.

1132
01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:26.835
the girl who's shot. the
disabled boy. the other man.

1133
01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:28.044
and my entire team.

1134
01:23:28.044 --> 01:23:29.212
And the Iraqi's. we'll all die.

1135
01:23:29.212 --> 01:23:30.338
What's the point of that?

1136
01:23:30.338 --> 01:23:32.215
There's no human way to do this God.

1137
01:23:32.215 --> 01:23:34.467
It's not just about
courage. it's impossible.

1138
01:23:36.094 --> 01:23:37.595
Just take her God.

1139
01:23:37.595 --> 01:23:39.848
Then I thought. God
you're bigger than that.

1140
01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:41.182
But I don't know what to do.

1141
01:23:41.182 --> 01:23:43.601
So I grab Zuhair's hand
and I just whisper this.

1142
01:23:43.601 --> 01:23:48.023
"God help. God help. in Jesus name."

1143
01:23:49.482 --> 01:23:51.067
And right when I prayed that.

1144
01:23:51.067 --> 01:23:51.901
his eyes go.

1145
01:23:54.195 --> 01:23:55.405
Look at that.

1146
01:23:55.405 --> 01:23:57.866
And we look above us and there's wiring.

1147
01:23:57.866 --> 01:23:58.700
Started pulling the wiring.

1148
01:23:58.700 --> 01:23:59.659
I had my knife and I cut it down.

1149
01:23:59.659 --> 01:24:01.745
and we made 30 meters of wire.

1150
01:24:01.745 --> 01:24:04.038
Which was about how far
she was from us 30 yards.

1151
01:24:04.038 --> 01:24:05.790
And he whispered something in
Arabic to that little girl.

1152
01:24:05.790 --> 01:24:07.459
Who'd be catatonic the whole time.

1153
01:24:08.585 --> 01:24:10.879
She runs out about 15-20 yards.

1154
01:24:11.713 --> 01:24:14.674
ISIS takes two shots
but there's a low wall

1155
01:24:14.674 --> 01:24:16.051
and they must not have
had a good angle on her.

1156
01:24:16.051 --> 01:24:17.886
Probably surprised them.

1157
01:24:17.886 --> 01:24:19.804
She throws the wire out and runs back.

1158
01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:23.391
And the woman is laying on her back.

1159
01:24:23.391 --> 01:24:24.642
And I'm just praying she can do this.

1160
01:24:24.642 --> 01:24:27.854
She ties that wire on to
her hand with one arm.

1161
01:24:27.854 --> 01:24:29.564
Three days in the sun and shot.

1162
01:24:29.564 --> 01:24:31.274
She could have the strength to do that.

1163
01:24:31.274 --> 01:24:33.443
I'm just praying Lord. help it hold.

1164
01:24:33.443 --> 01:24:35.403
And then we just pull her in like this.

1165
01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:40.950
Hang in there.

1166
01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:42.118
Hang in there.

1167
01:24:49.793 --> 01:24:51.211
Easy. easy. easy.

1168
01:24:56.424 --> 01:24:58.426
As we pulled her up to us she said.

1169
01:24:58.426 --> 01:25:00.345
"God your great. God your great.

1170
01:25:00.345 --> 01:25:02.931
"Thank you. you did not forsake
me when I called on you."

1171
01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:03.807
Then she looked at me and said.

1172
01:25:03.807 --> 01:25:05.892
"Thank you brother. you didn't leave me."

1173
01:25:35.797 --> 01:25:37.131
I came this close to leaving.

1174
01:25:37.131 --> 01:25:38.800
Because I didn't have a
solution. I had no idea.

1175
01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:41.052
I wanted her to go to heaven.

1176
01:25:41.052 --> 01:25:42.804
And so. that's why I
go back to that story.

1177
01:25:42.804 --> 01:25:44.013
What's the story?

1178
01:25:44.013 --> 01:25:46.099
The power of evil is so great.

1179
01:25:46.099 --> 01:25:48.184
We are at our limit of courage.

1180
01:25:48.184 --> 01:25:49.978
of ability and it's not enough.

1181
01:25:49.978 --> 01:25:51.980
Even on our best days. not enough.

1182
01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:55.066
But we call on Jesus name.
and he comes right through us.

1183
01:25:55.066 --> 01:25:57.861
and finds a solution and brings good out.

1184
01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:07.954
This is Iman.

1185
01:26:12.333 --> 01:26:13.293
They both made it.

1186
01:26:13.293 --> 01:26:14.919
Thank you for making it
the rest of the way. Jesus. Amen.

1187
01:26:16.796 --> 01:26:18.673
Some viewers. if the word Jesus is there.

1188
01:26:18.673 --> 01:26:20.049
which it needs to be there.

1189
01:26:20.049 --> 01:26:23.803
They'll kind of wince. and go
awe. shoot. they ruined it.

1190
01:26:23.803 --> 01:26:25.096
Nutcases.

1191
01:26:25.096 --> 01:26:26.306
But somewhere down the road.

1192
01:26:26.306 --> 01:26:27.724
when they're in trouble.

1193
01:26:27.724 --> 01:26:28.850
They'll remember that.

1194
01:26:30.351 --> 01:26:32.270
And when they're drowning they'll go. oh!

1195
01:26:32.270 --> 01:26:36.816
I got no rope. I wonder if this will work?

1196
01:27:02.342 --> 01:27:04.010
You guys are driving behind ours.

1197
01:27:15.688 --> 01:27:16.689
I think the biggest thing that

1198
01:27:16.689 --> 01:27:19.567
always surprises me about
Mosul. is we're here.

1199
01:27:19.567 --> 01:27:22.487
This is the heart of ISIS.

1200
01:27:22.487 --> 01:27:24.322
And. now we're driving around in it.

1201
01:27:26.574 --> 01:27:28.451
We come back to visit the people we love.

1202
01:27:28.451 --> 01:27:30.286
We helped to rescue.

1203
01:27:30.286 --> 01:27:31.871
And we can follow up on the treatment.

1204
01:27:31.871 --> 01:27:33.456
We can follow up on their lives.

1205
01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:36.709
Whether it's helping
with operations or cost.

1206
01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:38.294
Or getting other people to help.

1207
01:27:41.089 --> 01:27:44.842
If I had to pick one lesson
from the last 24 years.

1208
01:27:44.842 --> 01:27:47.428
The anecdote to evil is love.

1209
01:27:54.435 --> 01:27:55.937
The tank was about right here.

1210
01:27:57.188 --> 01:28:00.984
Ran across here. behind the tank.

1211
01:28:00.984 --> 01:28:03.444
I crossed that line of love.

1212
01:28:03.444 --> 01:28:05.154
Where you give up everything
that's precious to you.

1213
01:28:05.154 --> 01:28:08.533
My own life. my own wife. my own kids.

1214
01:28:08.533 --> 01:28:09.826
I'll never see them again.

1215
01:28:11.536 --> 01:28:15.373
Everything I ever hoped for
I put that away for you.

1216
01:28:23.631 --> 01:28:25.758
It's right. it's love. it's God.

1217
01:28:29.595 --> 01:28:32.181
Once you've given your life out for love.

1218
01:28:33.266 --> 01:28:35.268
you just want to be
with this person again.

1219
01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:58.791
You. um. are very strong.

1220
01:29:08.051 --> 01:29:09.969
I'm so happy to see you.

1221
01:29:09.969 --> 01:29:10.803
Can I hold you?

1222
01:29:17.268 --> 01:29:18.936
Tell her she's a very brave girl.

1223
01:29:21.064 --> 01:29:22.315
Here show me the picture.

1224
01:29:26.277 --> 01:29:28.738
The greatest thing we have
in this world is love.

1225
01:29:34.619 --> 01:29:36.788
Love helps you overcome your fears.

1226
01:29:46.964 --> 01:29:48.216
Go!

1227
01:29:49.425 --> 01:29:52.386
- We can see that people do survive.

1228
01:29:52.386 --> 01:29:54.639
There is this continuation of life

1229
01:29:55.640 --> 01:30:00.019
and whatever we're able to
intersect with in that moment

1230
01:30:00.019 --> 01:30:01.854
is what God has for us to do.

1231
01:30:03.106 --> 01:30:07.860
Tell him that I pick up
and he is shot again.

1232
01:30:36.430 --> 01:30:39.058
This is the medic from
Burma named Slowly.

1233
01:30:39.058 --> 01:30:40.017
He is with you.

1234
01:30:44.439 --> 01:30:46.816
When they see you alive
they will be very happy.

1235
01:31:22.435 --> 01:31:27.356
Sheheen's memorial playground
close where he died in Mosul.

1236
01:31:34.655 --> 01:31:36.282
General Mustafa came back.

1237
01:31:36.282 --> 01:31:39.035
The same Iraqi Commander said.
"Do you know I was praying

1238
01:31:39.035 --> 01:31:41.120
"for God to help and look what he sent?

1239
01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:43.080
"An American Christian to help me.

1240
01:31:44.081 --> 01:31:45.291
"But I know he sent you.

1241
01:31:46.959 --> 01:31:49.170
"And when you go home. tell the American's

1242
01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:53.299
"thank you for showing us what
it means to follow Jesus."

1243
01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:38.386
- Was it worth it to get into
this wild and crazy life?

1244
01:32:38.386 --> 01:32:40.596
Oh. 100%. I wouldn't go back a day.

1245
01:32:40.596 --> 01:32:41.931
I am so thankful.

1246
01:32:43.849 --> 01:32:47.561
I have had my most profound times.

1247
01:32:47.561 --> 01:32:50.439
Where everything is just
right there on the edge.

1248
01:32:50.439 --> 01:32:52.608
And yet. God's hand is almost visible.

1249
01:33:23.264 --> 01:33:26.142
- The results of the work we've been

1250
01:33:26.142 --> 01:33:28.019
doing the last 24 years.

1251
01:33:28.978 --> 01:33:30.688
To go where things are difficult.

1252
01:33:30.688 --> 01:33:32.815
Help people who are in need.

1253
01:33:32.815 --> 01:33:36.777
Has been a deep satisfaction and gratitude

1254
01:33:36.777 --> 01:33:38.946
that I'm doing what I was made to do.

1255
01:33:40.573 --> 01:33:43.743
We gotta be part of life. of love!

1256
01:33:50.416 --> 01:33:51.917
I don't know how to describe that feeling

1257
01:33:51.917 --> 01:33:54.170
other than gratitude.

1258
01:33:54.170 --> 01:33:55.004
It's gratitude.

1259
01:33:57.548 --> 01:33:58.799
Thank you. God.
