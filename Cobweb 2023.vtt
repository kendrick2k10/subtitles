3
00:01:31.364 --> 00:01:33.564
Curl your fingers.

4
00:01:39.438 --> 00:01:40.868
Curve.

5
00:05:26.401 --> 00:05:27.765
Peter?

6
00:05:28.062 --> 00:05:30.031
I heard something.

7
00:05:30.438 --> 00:05:31.868
What?

8
00:05:31.868 --> 00:05:33.474
Peter?

9
00:05:33.936 --> 00:05:35.608
What time is it?

10
00:05:35.608 --> 00:05:37.104
What did you hear?

11
00:05:44.485 --> 00:05:45.882
Come on.

12
00:05:52.724 --> 00:05:54.154
This one?

13
00:06:09.774 --> 00:06:11.105
Hmm.

14
00:06:13.481 --> 00:06:15.483
I don’t hear anything.

15
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.716
Do you?

16
00:06:24.525 --> 00:06:26.120
This is an old house.

17
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.661
There’s bound to be bumps
in the night.

18
00:06:28.661 --> 00:06:30.828
Come to bed.

19
00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:40.200
You have a great. big.
beautiful imagination.

20
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.005
And all those scary things?

21
00:06:43.841 --> 00:06:47.042
They’re just
in your head.

22
00:07:30.085 --> 00:07:34.089
You’ll get more
at recess.

23
00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:43.835
All right. settle. Settle.

24
00:07:47.201 --> 00:07:48.906
Students.

25
00:07:48.906 --> 00:07:49.808
This is Miss Devine.

26
00:07:49.808 --> 00:07:51.711
She’ll be your
substitute teacher

27
00:07:51.711 --> 00:07:54.241
until Mrs. Bitler comes back.

28
00:07:54.241 --> 00:07:55.880
Good luck.

29
00:07:57.046 --> 00:07:58.113
Good morning.

30
00:07:58.113 --> 00:08:02.183
As your principal just said.
my name is Miss Devine.

31
00:08:02.183 --> 00:08:08.057
I look forward
to getting to know
each and every one of you.

32
00:08:14.833 --> 00:08:16.703
Peter.

33
00:08:16.703 --> 00:08:18.903
Recess is coming.

34
00:08:28.011 --> 00:08:29.881
Okay...

35
00:08:30.211 --> 00:08:31.179
Oh!

36
00:08:31.179 --> 00:08:33.984
Hi. Um...

37
00:08:34.556 --> 00:08:35.282
Peter.

38
00:08:35.282 --> 00:08:38.318
You’re supposed
to be at recess.

39
00:08:38.318 --> 00:08:40.694
I don’t like recess.

40
00:08:41.662 --> 00:08:44.995
You don’t want to play
with your friends?

41
00:08:50.836 --> 00:08:52.937
Okay. You can stay here.

42
00:08:52.937 --> 00:08:56.776
Yeah. you can help me
with the decorations.

43
00:08:57.612 --> 00:08:59.240
I love Halloween.

44
00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.111
Do you know
what you’re going as?

45
00:09:03.651 --> 00:09:07.083
Well. you have plenty of time
to figure it out.

46
00:09:13.925 --> 00:09:16.323
Look. it’s okay.
It’s okay.

47
00:09:16.323 --> 00:09:19.062
It’s okay. Here.

48
00:09:19.799 --> 00:09:21.295
Um...

49
00:09:25.167 --> 00:09:30.172
Yeah. and take this
and slide it under. okay?

50
00:09:30.172 --> 00:09:31.844
It’s okay.

51
00:09:34.748 --> 00:09:36.684
Yeah.

52
00:09:37.982 --> 00:09:40.853
There you go.
Like that.

53
00:09:40.853 --> 00:09:44.384
Pick it up. We’re gonna
take this to the window.

54
00:10:10.311 --> 00:10:11.279
Um...

55
00:10:11.279 --> 00:10:14.117
What am I gonna be
for Halloween?

56
00:10:15.822 --> 00:10:18.825
I want to dress up.
I want to trick-or-treat.

57
00:10:18.825 --> 00:10:21.157
All the other kids
at school get to do it.

58
00:10:21.157 --> 00:10:23.863
And we’re not
their parents.

59
00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:31.200
Hey. Pete.

60
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.972
You know the old house
down the end of the lane.

61
00:10:33.972 --> 00:10:36.843
with the boarded windows?

62
00:10:36.843 --> 00:10:39.714
He’s going
to find out eventually.

63
00:10:40.814 --> 00:10:43.850
Carol.
What?

64
00:10:44.851 --> 00:10:49.053
Well. a few years ago.
before you were born.

65
00:10:49.053 --> 00:10:51.220
the little girl
that lived there.

66
00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.058
she vanished
on Halloween.

67
00:10:54.289 --> 00:10:56.159
What happened?

68
00:10:56.159 --> 00:10:57.963
Well.
nobody knows.

69
00:10:57.963 --> 00:11:02.902
She went out
trick-or-treating
and she disappeared.

70
00:11:07.203 --> 00:11:10.239
It was a very traumatic event.

71
00:11:10.239 --> 00:11:12.714
For everybody
in the neighborhood.

72
00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:14.243
And I. personally.

73
00:11:15.046 --> 00:11:17.279
don’t like remembering it.

74
00:11:20.216 --> 00:11:23.153
Am I gonna disappear?
Oh. Peter.

75
00:11:23.153 --> 00:11:25.925
Of course not. honey. No.

76
00:11:25.925 --> 00:11:29.731
We would never let that
happen to you. Ever.

77
00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:31.095
Okay?

78
00:12:50.042 --> 00:12:52.242
Peter.
Daddy!

79
00:12:52.242 --> 00:12:54.849
No. Peter.
Don’t tell him.

80
00:12:54.849 --> 00:12:57.214
Daddy!

81
00:12:57.214 --> 00:12:58.578
Peter.

82
00:12:59.447 --> 00:13:01.823
Pete?

83
00:13:03.385 --> 00:13:05.420
What’s going on?

84
00:13:05.827 --> 00:13:07.554
I heard something again.

85
00:13:07.554 --> 00:13:09.831
Peter.

86
00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:12.493
I really did. though.

87
00:13:14.099 --> 00:13:18.136
All right.
and. uh. from where?

88
00:13:21.139 --> 00:13:22.503
Okay.

89
00:13:41.357 --> 00:13:43.997
You know what?
I bet it’s rats.

90
00:13:43.997 --> 00:13:47.396
But I’ve got something
that’ll take care of that.

91
00:13:47.396 --> 00:13:48.232
Rats?

92
00:14:09.253 --> 00:14:11.057
It smells like cinnamon.

93
00:14:11.057 --> 00:14:12.091
Well. be careful.

94
00:14:12.091 --> 00:14:15.424
Not everything is as sweet
as it seems.

95
00:14:18.592 --> 00:14:19.659
They eat it?

96
00:14:19.659 --> 00:14:23.234
That’s the idea.
Then what?

97
00:14:23.531 --> 00:14:24.532
Well...

98
00:14:32.606 --> 00:14:35.048
Pete. we can’t have rats.

99
00:14:35.048 --> 00:14:37.578
They bite. They...
They spread disease.

100
00:14:37.578 --> 00:14:42.253
Not to mention.
keep you up all hours
of the night.

101
00:14:42.957 --> 00:14:44.420
Mm-hmm?

102
00:14:44.684 --> 00:14:45.993
I guess.

103
00:14:45.993 --> 00:14:48.226
Look.

104
00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:58.038
Sometimes. you have
to make tough decisions

105
00:14:58.038 --> 00:15:01.305
to protect your family.

106
00:15:01.305 --> 00:15:03.241
You understand?

107
00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:05.947
Mm-hmm.

108
00:15:10.116 --> 00:15:13.647
"Throws
his shadow on the floor.

109
00:15:13.647 --> 00:15:16.320
"And my soul
from out that shadow

110
00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:20.258
"that lies floating
on the floor.

111
00:15:22.194 --> 00:15:24.361
"shall be lifted...

112
00:15:26.066 --> 00:15:27.166
"nevermore."

113
00:16:02.531 --> 00:16:04.467
May I help you?

114
00:16:04.467 --> 00:16:07.239
Uh. are you Peter’s mom?

115
00:16:09.274 --> 00:16:09.736
Yes...

116
00:16:09.736 --> 00:16:14.477
Sorry for showing up
like this. uninvited.

117
00:16:14.477 --> 00:16:16.710
I’m Peter’s teacher.

118
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:17.546
Substitute.

119
00:16:17.546 --> 00:16:20.615
Of course. he did mention
that he had a substitute.

120
00:16:20.615 --> 00:16:22.782
Never known one
to make house calls.

121
00:16:22.782 --> 00:16:25.290
Yeah. I just wanted
to come over

122
00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:29.195
and... and check
on him personally.

123
00:16:29.195 --> 00:16:31.626
Hmm. I was a teacher myself.

124
00:16:31.626 --> 00:16:35.498
That was before I...
I became a mother.

125
00:16:35.498 --> 00:16:36.664
Is he all right?

126
00:16:36.664 --> 00:16:39.370
Peter? Yes.

127
00:16:41.339 --> 00:16:42.736
Um...

128
00:16:42.736 --> 00:16:47.048
I... I did want
to show you something.

129
00:16:47.609 --> 00:16:48.379
What’s this?

130
00:16:48.379 --> 00:16:51.778
The children were drawing
for Halloween.

131
00:16:53.615 --> 00:16:55.551
Peter painted this?

132
00:16:55.551 --> 00:16:56.288
Yes. Yes.

133
00:16:56.288 --> 00:17:01.425
The other children drew monsters
and witches. but Peter...

134
00:17:01.755 --> 00:17:03.229
I see.

135
00:17:03.229 --> 00:17:06.265
Huh. Well.
this is embarrassing.

136
00:17:06.265 --> 00:17:10.269
You see. Peter has
an overactive imagination.

137
00:17:10.731 --> 00:17:13.074
He still wakes
his father and I up

138
00:17:13.074 --> 00:17:14.141
in the middle of the night

139
00:17:14.141 --> 00:17:17.738
with all of his little flights
of fancy which. uh.

140
00:17:17.738 --> 00:17:20.477
which is all this picture is.

141
00:17:20.477 --> 00:17:23.645
I do appreciate
your concern though.

142
00:17:34.755 --> 00:17:36.229
What is this?

143
00:17:36.229 --> 00:17:39.232
A drawing.
A drawing of what?

144
00:17:40.563 --> 00:17:42.631
A drawing of what?

145
00:17:44.303 --> 00:17:49.407
This is your room. Peter.
Why are you asking for help?

146
00:17:49.407 --> 00:17:50.177
I’m not.

147
00:17:50.177 --> 00:17:54.544
Why are you asking strangers
for help. Peter?

148
00:17:54.676 --> 00:17:56.810
I’m not.

149
00:18:01.551 --> 00:18:04.521
She is.
What was that?

150
00:18:10.758 --> 00:18:13.398
It’s just a scary drawing. Mom.

151
00:18:13.398 --> 00:18:16.500
Oh. that imagination
of yours. Peter.

152
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:20.339
It’s going to get you
into trouble one day.

153
00:18:34.419 --> 00:18:37.521
Wake up. Peter.

154
00:18:43.824 --> 00:18:44.792
Peter.

155
00:18:44.792 --> 00:18:47.498
Don’t be scared.

156
00:18:47.498 --> 00:18:49.896
I just want to talk.

157
00:18:51.766 --> 00:18:54.472
Please be quiet.

158
00:18:54.736 --> 00:18:56.738
I’m imagining you.

159
00:18:56.738 --> 00:18:58.872
You’re not real.

160
00:18:59.543 --> 00:19:01.842
Maybe. maybe not.

161
00:19:01.842 --> 00:19:06.583
But it seems to me
like you could use a friend.

162
00:19:07.254 --> 00:19:09.454
I know I could.

163
00:19:09.454 --> 00:19:13.590
But if you don’t want one.
I’ll just leave.

164
00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.232
Wait.
don’t go.

165
00:19:18.232 --> 00:19:19.761
I’m sorry.

166
00:19:19.761 --> 00:19:20.960
Please stay.

167
00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.962
Are you sure?

168
00:19:22.962 --> 00:19:25.932
Yes. we can talk.

169
00:19:34.908 --> 00:19:39.451
Peter. this is great.
What’s his name?

170
00:19:40.452 --> 00:19:41.915
Hector.

171
00:19:42.487 --> 00:19:43.785
Of course.

172
00:19:43.785 --> 00:19:45.655
He looks like a Hector.

173
00:19:45.655 --> 00:19:48.823
This one’s
my favorite.

174
00:19:48.823 --> 00:19:50.297
Shh.

175
00:20:27.895 --> 00:20:29.633
Stop!

176
00:20:29.831 --> 00:20:31.437
Please!

177
00:20:54.889 --> 00:20:57.694
Peter. Are you there?

178
00:21:01.401 --> 00:21:03.403
Are you okay?

179
00:21:04.503 --> 00:21:06.967
Why are you crying?

180
00:21:07.407 --> 00:21:09.640
Did someone hurt you?

181
00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.345
Mm.

182
00:21:11.345 --> 00:21:12.346
Brian.

183
00:21:12.346 --> 00:21:14.909
He shoves me down
every day.

184
00:21:14.909 --> 00:21:18.583
I was afraid
of something like that.

185
00:21:18.979 --> 00:21:21.949
But I believe in you. Peter.

186
00:21:21.949 --> 00:21:22.686
Mm.

187
00:21:22.686 --> 00:21:26.756
I bet
you’re strong enough
to stand up for yourself.

188
00:21:26.756 --> 00:21:28.824
If you just try.

189
00:21:45.841 --> 00:21:49.845
Busted.

190
00:21:56.621 --> 00:21:57.688
I’m sorry. Peter.

191
00:22:00.086 --> 00:22:03.991
That was very nice
of Brian. wasn’t it.
Peter?

192
00:22:10.833 --> 00:22:13.671
Show him
you’re not afraid anymore.

193
00:22:21.877 --> 00:22:24.880
Make him
afraid of you.

194
00:22:34.956 --> 00:22:36.562
You have to push back.

195
00:22:49.839 --> 00:22:51.412
Peter!
Why are you...

196
00:22:56.043 --> 00:22:57.814
Help!

197
00:23:10.893 --> 00:23:13.896
I don’t understand how
this could have happened!

198
00:23:13.896 --> 00:23:16.701
Peter has never done
anything like this before!

199
00:23:16.701 --> 00:23:19.605
He doesn’t have a violent bone
in his body!

200
00:23:19.605 --> 00:23:23.103
It was an accident.
I’m sure of it.

201
00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.611
Expelled?

202
00:23:25.743 --> 00:23:29.549
Do you have anything
to say for yourself. Peter?

203
00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:33.014
Peter?

204
00:23:33.014 --> 00:23:36.083
I didn’t mean for him
to fall down the stairs.

205
00:23:36.083 --> 00:23:38.118
For God’s sakes.
We are not a family

206
00:23:38.118 --> 00:23:41.693
that solves our problems
with violence. Peter.

207
00:23:41.693 --> 00:23:42.628
Ever.

208
00:23:42.628 --> 00:23:46.093
I don’t understand
where this kind of
behavior comes from!

209
00:23:46.093 --> 00:23:49.800
Peter drew a picture.
For school.

210
00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.032
What?
I’m sorry.

211
00:23:51.032 --> 00:23:52.737
I know that I should have
told you earlier.

212
00:23:52.737 --> 00:23:55.971
But I...
Hold on. hold on.
What kind of picture?

213
00:23:55.971 --> 00:23:58.875
What kind of picture.
Carol?

214
00:23:58.875 --> 00:24:00.646
A child.

215
00:24:00.646 --> 00:24:03.484
A child asking for help.

216
00:24:03.649 --> 00:24:04.650
What?

217
00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:06.179
I knew that you would
jump to conclusions.

218
00:24:06.179 --> 00:24:07.719
You’re only telling me
this now?

219
00:24:07.719 --> 00:24:09.182
And it’s just not possible.
Okay. stop.

220
00:24:09.182 --> 00:24:11.558
Even when I tell you about...
Stop.

221
00:24:11.558 --> 00:24:15.595
Peter. Why would you
draw a picture like that?

222
00:24:21.667 --> 00:24:23.735
Peter!
Because I really heard her!

223
00:24:23.735 --> 00:24:27.508
No. you did not! No!

224
00:24:32.106 --> 00:24:33.976
You’re grounded.

225
00:24:33.976 --> 00:24:35.549
Okay. Peter.
Go to your room.

226
00:24:35.549 --> 00:24:39.278
No. no. no! Carol.
he’s grounded.

227
00:24:39.278 --> 00:24:41.753
He’s going
in the basement.

228
00:24:42.919 --> 00:24:44.690
Now.

229
00:25:04.809 --> 00:25:06.580
Stand up.

230
00:25:07.273 --> 00:25:09.616
I said. stand up.

231
00:25:10.584 --> 00:25:12.311
Get up.

232
00:25:27.293 --> 00:25:28.899
Go.

233
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:36.038
Mom?

234
00:25:38.106 --> 00:25:39.844
Sit.

235
00:25:41.681 --> 00:25:45.916
We’re doing this
because we love you.
Because we love you.

236
00:26:10.974 --> 00:26:13.911
Hello?

237
00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:18.245
Are you there?

238
00:26:21.347 --> 00:26:23.822
Please talk to me.

239
00:26:46.713 --> 00:26:50.178
What a stupid thing.

240
00:26:51.652 --> 00:26:53.379
God damn it!

241
00:26:53.379 --> 00:26:54.347
Why won’t you work?

242
00:26:54.347 --> 00:26:57.955
You went
to a student’s house?

243
00:26:57.955 --> 00:26:59.055
I did.

244
00:26:59.055 --> 00:27:05.358
I wanted to make sure
that Peter was okay.

245
00:27:07.701 --> 00:27:10.704
Is he showing up
with bruises?

246
00:27:11.067 --> 00:27:12.970
No. not that I can see.

247
00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:13.872
Does he wet himself?

248
00:27:13.872 --> 00:27:18.371
Is he talking about sex
or other things a boy his age
shouldn’t know about?

249
00:27:18.371 --> 00:27:19.075
No.

250
00:27:19.075 --> 00:27:22.309
Then. unfortunately.
there’s nothing we can do.

251
00:27:23.178 --> 00:27:25.147
There are a lot of Peters.

252
00:27:25.147 --> 00:27:29.349
Delicate little kids
you want to protect
from life’s cruelties.

253
00:27:29.349 --> 00:27:34.156
but you can’t get
personally invested.

254
00:27:34.288 --> 00:27:36.829
You’ll be eaten alive.

255
00:27:43.836 --> 00:27:48.203
You’ve met his parents?
His mother. there’s something...

256
00:27:49.006 --> 00:27:50.942
off about her.

257
00:27:50.942 --> 00:27:52.845
There’s a child
that disappeared

258
00:27:52.845 --> 00:27:55.474
from their neighborhood
years ago.

259
00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:59.082
Something like that

260
00:27:59.082 --> 00:28:02.415
would make any parent overprotective.

261
00:29:39.248 --> 00:29:41.316
Hello.
Hi.

262
00:29:41.316 --> 00:29:43.857
I have Peter’s
last math quiz.

263
00:29:43.857 --> 00:29:47.960
I thought you should have it.
He only missed two.

264
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:51.832
Thank you for coming by.

265
00:29:51.832 --> 00:29:54.098
Uh...
Hi. there.

266
00:29:56.133 --> 00:30:00.137
Honey. this is
Miss Devine.

267
00:30:00.907 --> 00:30:02.876
Peter’s former teacher.

268
00:30:02.876 --> 00:30:03.536
Nice to meet you.

269
00:30:03.536 --> 00:30:05.879
She was just coming by
to drop off his last
math test.

270
00:30:05.879 --> 00:30:09.916
That’s wonderful.
We can hang it on the fridge.

271
00:30:11.951 --> 00:30:13.986
Please. come in.

272
00:30:13.986 --> 00:30:16.285
We just made coffee.

273
00:30:20.993 --> 00:30:22.995
This way.

274
00:30:33.907 --> 00:30:35.469
Have a seat.

275
00:30:37.009 --> 00:30:38.373
Thanks.

276
00:30:51.056 --> 00:30:52.618
Here you go.

277
00:30:53.553 --> 00:30:55.555
You’re bleeding.

278
00:30:55.555 --> 00:30:59.097
Oh. I’m just doing
some remodeling.

279
00:30:59.097 --> 00:30:59.933
Loose nail.

280
00:30:59.933 --> 00:31:02.100
Don’t worry about it.

281
00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:04.201
Uh. well. since I’m here.

282
00:31:04.201 --> 00:31:06.599
I just want to express
how sorry I am

283
00:31:06.599 --> 00:31:08.535
about what happened. Aw.

284
00:31:08.535 --> 00:31:11.340
That’s very.
very sweet of you.

285
00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:15.982
But honestly.
no apology necessary.

286
00:31:16.477 --> 00:31:18.677
Peter is a spirited boy.

287
00:31:18.677 --> 00:31:23.484
Uh. do you have any idea
where Peter will be going
to school?

288
00:31:23.484 --> 00:31:25.959
Of course.
we do.

289
00:31:26.322 --> 00:31:28.225
Here. At home.

290
00:31:28.225 --> 00:31:28.929
Oh.

291
00:31:28.929 --> 00:31:32.097
Carol is the best teacher
Peter could ever have.

292
00:31:32.097 --> 00:31:35.463
What? You don’t think
that’s a good idea?
Uh...

293
00:31:35.463 --> 00:31:37.135
I just think that.
um.

294
00:31:37.135 --> 00:31:43.042
given his behavior.
he might benefit
from an environment

295
00:31:43.042 --> 00:31:44.538
more suited toward
his needs?

296
00:31:44.538 --> 00:31:48.410
No. we’re not going
to give our son away.

297
00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:49.477
Thank you.
No. No.

298
00:31:49.477 --> 00:31:53.613
No. No. we’re not.
Family is what he needs.

299
00:31:53.613 --> 00:31:57.188
Family’s what
he’s gonna get.

300
00:31:57.584 --> 00:31:59.960
Where is he?

301
00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:03.326
He’s grounded.
In his room.

302
00:32:04.426 --> 00:32:08.331
May I see him?
No. you may not.

303
00:32:08.331 --> 00:32:10.003
I don’t think
it’s appropriate.

304
00:32:10.003 --> 00:32:11.400
I would just like
to say goodbye.

305
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.139
What is your interest
in our son?

306
00:32:14.139 --> 00:32:18.143
You’re no longer his teacher.
So. I... I don’t...

307
00:32:18.143 --> 00:32:19.177
It’s very strange to me

308
00:32:19.177 --> 00:32:21.641
that you continue
to show up at our house.

309
00:32:21.641 --> 00:32:25.282
I just wanted to make sure
he was all right.

310
00:32:25.282 --> 00:32:26.987
I’m sorry.
"that he was all right"?

311
00:32:26.987 --> 00:32:29.649
You think that
Peter’s in danger?

312
00:32:29.649 --> 00:32:31.387
Do you think that
I’m the kind of mother

313
00:32:31.387 --> 00:32:32.652
that would harm my child?
Okay.

314
00:32:32.652 --> 00:32:34.357
Honey. It’s okay.
I love Peter.

315
00:32:34.357 --> 00:32:38.031
We love Peter.
We love Peter.

316
00:32:38.031 --> 00:32:40.165
With every fiber
of our being.

317
00:32:40.165 --> 00:32:41.562
You don’t know
anything about...

318
00:32:41.562 --> 00:32:43.069
Hey. Hey. enough.
No. No. Before...

319
00:32:43.069 --> 00:32:45.566
How dare you? How dare
you come into our home...

320
00:32:45.566 --> 00:32:47.535
Honey. honey. honey.
Carol. Carol. Stop.

321
00:32:47.535 --> 00:32:50.241
...for you to tell us
what’s best for our son.

322
00:32:50.241 --> 00:32:52.705
She doesn’t...
Listen to me.

323
00:32:54.443 --> 00:32:57.479
What mother gives up
on her child?
Sweetheart. that’s enough.

324
00:32:57.479 --> 00:33:01.549
The audacity
of this woman! This stranger.

325
00:33:02.253 --> 00:33:04.222
You don’t know anything.
Don’t let the opinion

326
00:33:04.222 --> 00:33:06.389
of a stranger upset you.

327
00:33:06.389 --> 00:33:07.357
Enough. Hey. Enough.

328
00:33:07.357 --> 00:33:09.491
No. before I had Peter.
the doctor said...

329
00:33:09.491 --> 00:33:11.262
...Peter’s a miracle...
Help!

330
00:33:11.262 --> 00:33:12.791
...and I would
never give up on him.

331
00:33:12.791 --> 00:33:16.762
I would never give him away.
Never. Peter’s a miracle.

332
00:33:16.762 --> 00:33:19.105
An institute. for what?

333
00:33:19.105 --> 00:33:20.502
Help!

334
00:33:21.338 --> 00:33:24.638
Excuse me. I think
you better leave.

335
00:33:25.243 --> 00:33:28.213
I’m sorry.
This was a mistake.

336
00:33:50.301 --> 00:33:52.303
What is that?

337
00:33:53.106 --> 00:33:54.239
What?

338
00:33:54.239 --> 00:33:57.407
The noise.
The banging.

339
00:33:57.407 --> 00:34:00.608
The washing machine.

340
00:34:05.514 --> 00:34:07.252
Please.

341
00:34:29.472 --> 00:34:32.442
Forgot your keys.
Miss Devine.

342
00:34:34.642 --> 00:34:36.116
Thanks.

343
00:34:36.116 --> 00:34:38.118
You’re welcome.

344
00:35:25.396 --> 00:35:27.827
You can come out now.

345
00:35:28.828 --> 00:35:30.401
Here.

346
00:35:30.797 --> 00:35:32.436
Pumpkin.

347
00:35:33.173 --> 00:35:35.241
For our pumpkin.

348
00:35:51.521 --> 00:35:53.259
Well. Peter.

349
00:35:54.326 --> 00:35:57.230
Have you had time
to think?

350
00:36:01.201 --> 00:36:02.697
About what?

351
00:36:03.731 --> 00:36:07.405
About how I need
to grow up.

352
00:36:07.405 --> 00:36:11.475
Stop acting out.
Stop telling lies.

353
00:36:11.475 --> 00:36:13.510
And no more nightmares.

354
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:15.314
No more.

355
00:36:15.875 --> 00:36:17.844
We’re very proud of you. Peter.

356
00:36:17.844 --> 00:36:20.649
Things are going to be
different from now on.

357
00:36:20.649 --> 00:36:22.717
You won’t be going back
to school any longer.

358
00:36:22.717 --> 00:36:25.621
I’m gonna be
your teacher now.
That’s right.

359
00:36:25.621 --> 00:36:30.428
Your mom here.
she’s going to teach you
the three R’s. Pete.

360
00:36:30.428 --> 00:36:32.628
You know what they are?

361
00:36:32.628 --> 00:36:36.698
Readin’. Writin’.
and Arithmetic.

362
00:36:36.698 --> 00:36:38.568
Oh...

363
00:36:39.404 --> 00:36:41.802
Okay. I’m sorry.

364
00:36:42.902 --> 00:36:44.673
You’re a good boy. Peter.

365
00:36:44.673 --> 00:36:47.280
Oh. and we love you.

366
00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:49.645
And we forgive you.

367
00:36:49.645 --> 00:36:51.515
Love you too.

368
00:37:05.265 --> 00:37:06.827
Goodnight.
Peter.

369
00:37:06.827 --> 00:37:09.368
See you
in the morning. son.

370
00:37:09.368 --> 00:37:10.963
Good night.

371
00:38:04.324 --> 00:38:06.491
Please talk to me.

372
00:38:12.662 --> 00:38:15.830
Peter.
I was worried about you.

373
00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:19.471
My mom and dad
locked me in the basement.

374
00:38:19.471 --> 00:38:21.374
I knew it.

375
00:38:21.374 --> 00:38:23.871
You have to be careful
with them.

376
00:38:23.871 --> 00:38:26.808
They are not
what they seem.

377
00:38:27.611 --> 00:38:30.977
I want to see you. No.

378
00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:33.111
I’ve been here too long.

379
00:38:33.111 --> 00:38:36.081
You wouldn’t like
the looks of me.

380
00:38:36.521 --> 00:38:39.051
You’ll scream
and get us caught.

381
00:38:39.051 --> 00:38:41.823
No. I won’t.
I promise.

382
00:38:42.857 --> 00:38:43.858
Okay.

383
00:38:43.858 --> 00:38:48.467
There’s a hole
behind the wallpaper.

384
00:38:48.467 --> 00:38:50.601
Do you see it?

385
00:39:52.663 --> 00:39:55.094
Who are you?

386
00:39:57.866 --> 00:39:59.835
I’m your sister.

387
00:40:00.539 --> 00:40:01.936
Hmm?

388
00:40:02.167 --> 00:40:04.642
I’ve been waiting. Peter.

389
00:40:04.642 --> 00:40:07.942
I had to wait till
you were big enough.

390
00:40:07.942 --> 00:40:09.548
Big enough for what?

391
00:40:09.548 --> 00:40:14.146
Big enough
to move the clock
that hides the door.

392
00:40:14.718 --> 00:40:20.053
Big enough to help me escape.
To leave the dark.

393
00:40:20.757 --> 00:40:22.924
To leave the wall.

394
00:40:23.155 --> 00:40:27.632
Please stop.
No. you’re scaring me.

395
00:40:28.226 --> 00:40:30.998
You need to be scared.

396
00:40:30.998 --> 00:40:35.200
Mom and Dad.
they’re evil. Peter.

397
00:40:35.673 --> 00:40:37.675
Now you know.

398
00:40:37.906 --> 00:40:40.106
Your time is coming.

399
00:41:10.103 --> 00:41:11.775
Hello?

400
00:41:15.042 --> 00:41:16.615
Mom?

401
00:41:47.173 --> 00:41:48.845
Hello?

402
00:41:53.883 --> 00:41:55.588
Mom?

403
00:42:09.965 --> 00:42:13.166
Mom?

404
00:42:13.166 --> 00:42:14.838
Peter.

405
00:42:34.319 --> 00:42:37.762
Look what you’ve done
to your mother. Peter.

406
00:42:58.343 --> 00:42:59.080
Peter.

407
00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:02.886
You were screaming
and thrashing around.

408
00:43:02.886 --> 00:43:04.217
Shh.

409
00:43:04.217 --> 00:43:07.858
It’s okay. It was
just a bad dream.

410
00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:11.125
Shh.

411
00:43:16.229 --> 00:43:17.802
Wha...

412
00:43:18.396 --> 00:43:20.365
What was it about?

413
00:43:23.104 --> 00:43:24.644
I...

414
00:43:24.941 --> 00:43:26.910
I don’t remember.

415
00:43:28.681 --> 00:43:32.014
Well. it can’t hurt you now.

416
00:43:34.313 --> 00:43:37.019
If they keep you in their room.

417
00:43:37.019 --> 00:43:39.989
then how are you
talking to me?

418
00:43:39.989 --> 00:43:42.057
I escaped.

419
00:43:42.057 --> 00:43:45.830
I scratched and clawed
my way to you.

420
00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:49.328
Mom and Dad?
They hate me. Peter.

421
00:43:49.328 --> 00:43:54.366
Once they’ve had enough of me.
I’m finished.

422
00:43:55.004 --> 00:43:57.006
They’ll kill me.

423
00:43:57.006 --> 00:43:59.943
And they’ll put you
in the wall.

424
00:43:59.943 --> 00:44:01.406
No.

425
00:44:02.143 --> 00:44:03.947
They wouldn’t do that.

426
00:44:03.947 --> 00:44:06.312
They wouldn’t kill anybody.

427
00:44:06.785 --> 00:44:08.149
No. Peter.

428
00:44:08.149 --> 00:44:09.887
They already have.

429
00:44:09.887 --> 00:44:14.155
You need to see
what’s buried in the garden.

430
00:44:14.793 --> 00:44:17.158
I’ll tell you where.

431
00:45:15.051 --> 00:45:16.756
Peter.

432
00:45:41.341 --> 00:45:42.210
Peter.

433
00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:43.948
What are you doing?

434
00:45:48.546 --> 00:45:50.086
I was thinking that. um.

435
00:45:50.086 --> 00:45:52.517
I know I can’t go
trick-or-treating.

436
00:45:52.517 --> 00:45:57.159
but maybe we could
carve a pumpkin.

437
00:46:03.803 --> 00:46:06.465
It was Halloween.

438
00:46:06.971 --> 00:46:09.270
Before they locked me
in the wall.

439
00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:16.816
A trick-or-treater came
to the door.

440
00:46:17.146 --> 00:46:18.543
I asked her for help.

441
00:46:18.543 --> 00:46:21.513
And she saw me.

442
00:46:22.855 --> 00:46:25.253
They killed her. Peter.

443
00:46:27.453 --> 00:46:30.291
I don’t want to end up
like that girl.

444
00:46:30.830 --> 00:46:32.832
I’m getting you out of there.

445
00:46:32.832 --> 00:46:35.494
I’m gonna get you out
of there and then.

446
00:46:35.494 --> 00:46:37.595
then we’re gonna run away.

447
00:46:37.595 --> 00:46:42.468
We’re gonna be a family.
A real one.

448
00:46:43.568 --> 00:46:45.471
But how?

449
00:46:51.477 --> 00:46:55.151
I think I know
somebody that can help.

450
00:47:36.126 --> 00:47:37.325
Hello?

451
00:47:37.325 --> 00:47:39.426
Miss Devine?

452
00:47:40.625 --> 00:47:42.330
Peter?

453
00:47:46.664 --> 00:47:49.073
I need your help.

454
00:47:49.535 --> 00:47:50.910
What did you say?

455
00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:52.373
I need your help.

456
00:48:13.163 --> 00:48:14.527
Hello?

457
00:48:15.231 --> 00:48:18.267
Hi. is this Peter’s mom?

458
00:48:18.938 --> 00:48:21.600
It is. Is this Miss Devine?

459
00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:24.405
I think Peter just tried
to call me.

460
00:48:24.405 --> 00:48:25.241
He did. indeed.

461
00:48:25.241 --> 00:48:28.475
Peter was just telling me
how dearly he misses
his teacher.

462
00:48:28.475 --> 00:48:31.676
and so I said.
"Peter. just give her a ring.

463
00:48:31.676 --> 00:48:32.985
"Tell her yourself."

464
00:48:32.985 --> 00:48:38.485
But unfortunately.
his shy streak seems
to have gotten the best of him.

465
00:48:38.485 --> 00:48:41.257
He’s like a little
blushing bride over here.

466
00:48:41.257 --> 00:48:43.996
It’s so cute.

467
00:48:43.996 --> 00:48:48.066
Well. better luck next time.
I suppose.

468
00:48:48.066 --> 00:48:53.203
So sorry to have bothered you.
Have a happy Halloween.

469
00:48:59.044 --> 00:49:01.211
That was bad. Peter.

470
00:49:01.211 --> 00:49:03.576
I’m sorry.

471
00:49:03.576 --> 00:49:05.314
You did a very bad thing.

472
00:49:05.314 --> 00:49:09.021
You called a stranger?

473
00:49:09.021 --> 00:49:10.484
She doesn’t know
best for you.

474
00:49:10.484 --> 00:49:14.686
She doesn’t love you
the way your father and I do.

475
00:49:15.555 --> 00:49:19.394
I am so disappointed in you.

476
00:49:25.532 --> 00:49:27.336
What is that?

477
00:49:27.534 --> 00:49:29.404
It’s nothing!

478
00:49:46.652 --> 00:49:48.192
No.

479
00:49:51.162 --> 00:49:52.493
No...

480
00:49:53.065 --> 00:49:54.528
No. no.

481
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:57.333
No. No.

482
00:49:59.731 --> 00:50:01.205
No.

483
00:50:06.243 --> 00:50:09.147
What... What did she tell you?

484
00:50:11.083 --> 00:50:12.612
What did she tell you?

485
00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:23.788
It doesn’t matter. Whatever.

486
00:50:23.788 --> 00:50:29.068
Whatever happens now.
it will be your fault.

487
00:50:30.729 --> 00:50:36.372
You just wait until
your father gets home.

488
00:50:47.713 --> 00:50:50.221
Peter.

489
00:50:53.125 --> 00:50:54.588
Peter.

490
00:50:56.161 --> 00:50:57.855
I heard them.

491
00:51:01.727 --> 00:51:03.498
They know.

492
00:51:05.599 --> 00:51:08.338
They are going
to kill us.

493
00:51:08.833 --> 00:51:12.705
Peter. you have
to do something.

494
00:51:13.343 --> 00:51:14.707
Peter.

495
00:51:42.669 --> 00:51:45.837
Clean house.
That’s all there is to it.
I don’t want to.

496
00:51:45.837 --> 00:51:47.707
We can’t keep finding
temporary solutions.

497
00:51:47.707 --> 00:51:50.908
That is...

498
00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:12.798
I know you’re awake. son.

499
00:52:13.766 --> 00:52:15.372
You get a good night’s sleep.

500
00:52:15.372 --> 00:52:20.509
When I get home tomorrow.
you’ll help me out
in the garden.

501
00:52:20.509 --> 00:52:23.842
There’s a problem
we need to take care of.

502
00:53:01.352 --> 00:53:06.357
It’s black rot.
Killing off the whole garden.

503
00:53:06.885 --> 00:53:09.525
And blight like this.

504
00:53:10.658 --> 00:53:12.726
it spreads fast.

505
00:53:12.726 --> 00:53:15.234
Get rid of it now or...

506
00:53:15.762 --> 00:53:19.535
or all the healthy pumpkins
will get infected.

507
00:53:22.736 --> 00:53:25.277
And we can’t have that.

508
00:53:25.277 --> 00:53:27.279
We’re going
to bury the pumpkins.

509
00:53:27.279 --> 00:53:31.778
and we’re going to hope
that the next crop is better.

510
00:53:31.778 --> 00:53:34.253
Better luck next time.

511
00:53:34.913 --> 00:53:36.750
You understand?

512
00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:40.721
So. I want you
to pick up that shovel

513
00:53:40.721 --> 00:53:42.426
and dig.

514
00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:23.896
Hey. cuz.
this is the house?

515
00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:28.307
Yeah.

516
00:54:30.705 --> 00:54:32.311
Wicked.

517
00:54:58.535 --> 00:54:59.932
Sorry.

518
00:55:24.055 --> 00:55:26.695
Can a family
not eat in peace?

519
00:55:32.129 --> 00:55:33.702
Stop playing
with your food. Peter.

520
00:55:33.702 --> 00:55:35.440
Trick-or-treat!

521
00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:37.068
Go away!

522
00:55:46.616 --> 00:55:48.585
Porch light off?

523
00:55:49.047 --> 00:55:50.653
Yes.

524
00:56:12.004 --> 00:56:16.547
Did you do something different
with the soup tonight?

525
00:56:18.813 --> 00:56:21.486
Did I do something different
with the soup?

526
00:56:21.486 --> 00:56:22.949
Yeah.

527
00:56:23.653 --> 00:56:24.555
No.

528
00:56:24.555 --> 00:56:27.426
I mean. it’s delicious.
It’s great. Right?

529
00:56:27.426 --> 00:56:31.727
It just tastes
a little different.

530
00:56:46.808 --> 00:56:48.139
Hmm.

531
00:56:54.750 --> 00:56:56.884
It smells like...

532
00:57:00.184 --> 00:57:03.528
Smell it.
Yeah. it smells
like cinnamon.

533
00:57:03.528 --> 00:57:04.991
Mm.

534
00:57:51.268 --> 00:57:52.808
Peter.

535
00:57:57.945 --> 00:58:01.586
Peter. Have you done something?

536
00:58:05.656 --> 00:58:07.218
Peter.

537
00:58:07.724 --> 00:58:09.957
Son. look at me.

538
00:58:10.958 --> 00:58:13.059
Tell me the truth.

539
00:58:13.697 --> 00:58:15.831
What have you done?

540
00:58:17.998 --> 00:58:21.837
What did you do?
You tell me.

541
00:58:22.772 --> 00:58:25.005
Tell me. what did you do?

542
00:58:25.005 --> 00:58:27.612
You hurt my sister.

543
00:58:29.548 --> 00:58:32.782
What did you say?
Oh. my God.

544
00:58:32.782 --> 00:58:34.146
Oh. my God.

545
00:58:36.313 --> 00:58:37.149
Call 911.

546
00:58:37.149 --> 00:58:40.922
What is going on?
Call 911!

547
00:59:33.304 --> 00:59:34.976
Peter!

548
00:59:35.713 --> 00:59:36.681
Stop!

549
01:01:02.426 --> 01:01:05.231
Peter.

550
01:01:05.231 --> 01:01:07.970
Don’t let her out.

551
01:01:16.176 --> 01:01:19.476
Don’t let her...

552
01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:21.786
out.

553
01:01:34.766 --> 01:01:38.099
Peter. is that you?

554
01:01:39.331 --> 01:01:41.135
Did you do it?

555
01:01:41.135 --> 01:01:42.774
Are they gone?

556
01:01:42.774 --> 01:01:44.402
I don’t know.

557
01:01:45.403 --> 01:01:47.240
I think so.

558
01:01:47.405 --> 01:01:50.012
Do you have the keys?

559
01:01:51.849 --> 01:01:53.246
Yeah.

560
01:01:54.049 --> 01:01:56.117
The clock.

561
01:01:56.755 --> 01:01:58.416
Be careful.

562
01:01:59.021 --> 01:02:01.287
It’s so heavy.

563
01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:50.369
Peter. Are you all right?

564
01:02:51.304 --> 01:02:54.010
I’m okay.

565
01:02:55.143 --> 01:02:57.310
Do you see it?

566
01:02:57.816 --> 01:03:00.313
Do you think you could open it?

567
01:04:36.343 --> 01:04:41.051
Good boy. Peter.

568
01:04:42.382 --> 01:04:47.156
What was it like
watching them die?

569
01:04:49.059 --> 01:04:51.424
Trick-or-treat!

570
01:04:51.424 --> 01:04:55.098
Just like the girl
in the garden.

571
01:05:01.434 --> 01:05:05.273
Hey. Peter!
You alone in there?

572
01:05:05.273 --> 01:05:07.979
We just came by to say hi.

573
01:05:33.433 --> 01:05:36.139
Are they fucking
with us?

574
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:40.704
Let’s get this done.

575
01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:57.721
Hey. Peter.

576
01:05:59.393 --> 01:06:01.131
Are you here?

577
01:06:04.431 --> 01:06:07.500
We know
you’re in here!

578
01:06:14.408 --> 01:06:18.247
Peter. where the fuck are you?

579
01:07:07.296 --> 01:07:09.364
What the fuck?

580
01:08:52.797 --> 01:08:54.535
Huh?

581
01:09:40.416 --> 01:09:42.319
No!

582
01:09:44.255 --> 01:09:45.751
Brian. my leg!

583
01:09:45.751 --> 01:09:47.984
It’s got my leg.
Brian. help me!

584
01:09:54.925 --> 01:09:56.465
Brian. help me!

585
01:09:56.465 --> 01:09:58.533
No! No!

586
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:35.801
No. no!

587
01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:45.844
Brian?

588
01:10:52.653 --> 01:10:53.984
What?

589
01:10:56.492 --> 01:10:57.922
Brian?

590
01:11:01.431 --> 01:11:02.894
Brian?

591
01:11:03.961 --> 01:11:05.600
Brian!

592
01:11:19.779 --> 01:11:21.649
What did you say?

593
01:11:29.657 --> 01:11:30.394
Go!

594
01:11:47.576 --> 01:11:49.875
No!

595
01:12:27.143 --> 01:12:30.949
When you were born.

596
01:12:31.422 --> 01:12:34.722
they were so happy.

597
01:12:35.052 --> 01:12:37.824
When I was born.

598
01:12:38.627 --> 01:12:40.959
they screamed.

599
01:12:41.696 --> 01:12:44.864
So. Daddy made me a pit.

600
01:12:44.864 --> 01:12:47.702
Then he made me a cage.

601
01:12:47.702 --> 01:12:52.674
While you were whining
in this warm bed.

602
01:12:52.674 --> 01:12:57.448
I was suffering
among cobwebs and rats.

603
01:12:58.042 --> 01:13:01.144
learning how to climb.

604
01:13:01.782 --> 01:13:03.718
how to bite.

605
01:13:04.015 --> 01:13:09.922
learning how
to make you do what I want.

606
01:13:12.826 --> 01:13:14.894
Trick-or-treat.

607
01:13:23.606 --> 01:13:25.872
Let me go. please!

608
01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:30.008
Help!

609
01:13:30.008 --> 01:13:32.648
You’ll be
safe in here.

610
01:14:29.133 --> 01:14:30.970
Hello?

611
01:14:36.646 --> 01:14:38.109
Peter?

612
01:14:44.148 --> 01:14:45.787
Peter.

613
01:14:48.955 --> 01:14:53.861
Oh.
my fucking God.
What the fuck?

614
01:15:52.315 --> 01:15:54.152
Run!

615
01:15:56.022 --> 01:15:57.628
Peter?

616
01:15:58.695 --> 01:16:01.159
Miss Devine!
Peter.

617
01:16:01.159 --> 01:16:03.964
Miss Devine. run!

618
01:16:24.149 --> 01:16:27.691
Miss Devine. run!

619
01:16:35.897 --> 01:16:38.900
Miss Devine. run!

620
01:16:45.005 --> 01:16:48.338
Peter! God. Oh. my God.

621
01:16:48.943 --> 01:16:49.779
You have to run.

622
01:16:49.779 --> 01:16:50.978
No. no. I’m not
leaving you here.

623
01:16:50.978 --> 01:16:52.111
You have to get out of here!

624
01:17:05.256 --> 01:17:07.764
What the hell is that thing?

625
01:17:08.666 --> 01:17:10.228
It’s my sister.

626
01:17:18.676 --> 01:17:21.712
She’s coming!

627
01:17:21.976 --> 01:17:23.912
Stand back.

628
01:17:38.223 --> 01:17:41.061
Peter. come on.
Come on. Peter. Come on.

629
01:17:46.231 --> 01:17:47.969
Come on. Peter.

630
01:17:49.905 --> 01:17:52.941
Where are you going?
The keys.

631
01:17:52.941 --> 01:17:55.405
Come on. Go. go.

632
01:18:10.354 --> 01:18:12.389
No!

633
01:19:46.087 --> 01:19:47.924
Why are you
like this?

634
01:19:47.924 --> 01:19:53.358
Not every child can be
as perfect as you. Peter.

635
01:19:53.831 --> 01:19:56.394
I was just
born this way.

636
01:19:56.394 --> 01:19:59.397
And no one loves
a monster.

637
01:20:01.938 --> 01:20:05.139
Peter!
Miss Devine!

638
01:20:13.411 --> 01:20:16.315
I don’t know what you are.

639
01:20:16.315 --> 01:20:18.856
but if you hurt him.

640
01:20:19.923 --> 01:20:21.518
I’ll fucking kill you.

641
01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:24.862
No!

642
01:20:26.490 --> 01:20:28.492
Miss Devine!

643
01:21:36.626 --> 01:21:39.398
Peter!

644
01:21:41.136 --> 01:21:42.566
Please.

645
01:21:42.566 --> 01:21:44.040
You’re my brother.

646
01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:45.503
Peter. let’s go.

647
01:21:45.503 --> 01:21:47.670
Don’t you see. Peter?

648
01:21:47.670 --> 01:21:49.111
It’s in our blood.

649
01:21:49.111 --> 01:21:51.014
You killed Mom and Dad.

650
01:21:51.014 --> 01:21:52.378
You’re just like me.

651
01:21:52.378 --> 01:21:54.116
No!

652
01:21:55.348 --> 01:21:56.283
I’m not like you.

653
01:21:56.283 --> 01:22:01.717
Do you really think this is
gonna keep me down here?

654
01:22:02.388 --> 01:22:04.159
Every night.

655
01:22:04.324 --> 01:22:06.557
when you lie in bed.

656
01:22:06.557 --> 01:22:10.033
you’ll wonder
if you locked the door.

657
01:22:12.365 --> 01:22:15.500
or saw a shadow move.

658
01:22:18.569 --> 01:22:20.703
Every creak.

659
01:22:21.275 --> 01:22:23.673
every groan.

660
01:22:23.673 --> 01:22:26.280
every tap in the wall.

661
01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:29.085
you’ll think of me.

662
01:22:29.382 --> 01:22:32.055
We’re family. Peter.

663
01:22:46.333 --> 01:22:49.303
I will always be with you.

664
01:22:49.567 --> 01:22:51.701
Always.
