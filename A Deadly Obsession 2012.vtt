[rock music playing]

4
00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:29.097
[panting]

5
00:00:53.321 --> 00:00:59.227
[woman] My dad came
home once. drunk...

6
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.795
...and told my mom
that he had been fired.

7
00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.099
like it was a joke.

8
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:07.101
But that was just kind
of the way my dad was.

9
00:01:07.135 --> 00:01:10.371
you know. it wasn't
really his fault. really.

10
00:01:10.404 --> 00:01:11.839
Go on.

11
00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:18.346
She started screaming at him.

12
00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:20.314
Telling him that he
wasn't a real man.

13
00:01:20.348 --> 00:01:23.451
and that she couldn't
be the only breadwinner.

14
00:01:23.484 --> 00:01:26.387
And then she kicked him out.

15
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.389
Kind of like she'd been
looking for a reason

16
00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:31.225
to kick him out. actually.

17
00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:35.529
How'd your father react?

18
00:01:37.565 --> 00:01:42.470
[sighs] He said that he
was taking me with him.

19
00:01:42.503 --> 00:01:46.607
That he wasn't going to
let me turn out like her.

20
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.144
So he came in my room.
and he was bending over...

21
00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:52.780
...uh. when she did it.

22
00:01:52.813 --> 00:01:56.350
- When she shot him.
- Yes.

23
00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:00.521
In the head.

24
00:02:00.554 --> 00:02:04.792
with a gun that he used to
keep in his bedside drawer.

25
00:02:06.827 --> 00:02:08.629
And you were how old?

26
00:02:12.566 --> 00:02:14.335
Six.

27
00:02:17.605 --> 00:02:19.873
I was six.

28
00:02:23.711 --> 00:02:25.913
- [sighs]
- [pen scratching]

29
00:02:25.946 --> 00:02:28.349
Have you ever gone
to visit your mother?

30
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.754
No.

31
00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:45.733
* I really don't mind

32
00:02:45.766 --> 00:02:47.635
* Walking in the rain

33
00:02:47.668 --> 00:02:49.870
* But if you hold my hands
up close *

34
00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:53.541
* You'll see a different
shade of pain *

35
00:02:53.574 --> 00:02:55.776
* And I really don't mind

36
00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:58.279
* And I really
don't give a... *

37
00:02:58.312 --> 00:03:01.249
* Put your head
upon my shoulder *

38
00:03:01.282 --> 00:03:04.452
* Look ahead and take your
feet up off the ground *

39
00:03:04.485 --> 00:03:06.620
* And I really don't mind

40
00:03:06.654 --> 00:03:09.490
* And I really
don't give a... *

41
00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:11.759
* Your head upon my shoulder

42
00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:16.864
* Look ahead take your feet up
off the ground *

43
00:03:48.962 --> 00:03:51.665
[panting]

44
00:04:06.947 --> 00:04:09.249
[laughing]

45
00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:14.855
[both gasping. panting]

46
00:04:20.661 --> 00:04:21.995
Remember our
first run up here?

47
00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:23.697
[laughs] Of course.

48
00:04:23.731 --> 00:04:26.066
It was right after
your first deployment.

49
00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.835
[laughing] Yeah.

50
00:04:27.868 --> 00:04:29.937
Uh...

51
00:04:31.472 --> 00:04:33.341
Uh. Suzanne...

52
00:04:34.675 --> 00:04:36.710
You are. uh...

53
00:04:38.346 --> 00:04:42.015
You are so beautiful. and...

54
00:04:43.884 --> 00:04:50.624
...and strong.
and you're smart. and...

55
00:04:50.658 --> 00:04:57.431
...no one knows me as well
as you know me. and...

56
00:04:57.465 --> 00:05:00.501
Baby. this is really sweet. but
you're making me really nervous.

57
00:05:00.534 --> 00:05:02.936
Uh...

58
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.505
[clears throat]

59
00:05:04.538 --> 00:05:06.874
[nervous sigh]

60
00:05:07.875 --> 00:05:09.543
Will you marry me?

61
00:05:15.783 --> 00:05:17.551
I don't know what to say.

62
00:05:17.585 --> 00:05:22.089
"Yes" would be a really
good thing to say... right now.

63
00:05:23.557 --> 00:05:25.393
I can't.

64
00:05:28.896 --> 00:05:32.833
I'm sorry. will you just...
Will you stand up please?

65
00:05:32.866 --> 00:05:35.869
I just wasn't expecting this.
I... [clears throat]

66
00:05:37.037 --> 00:05:39.807
Baby. I love you.

67
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.943
I just have some things
that I need to work out

68
00:05:42.976 --> 00:05:45.946
before I can commit.
you know?

69
00:05:48.982 --> 00:05:51.585
No. I... I'm committed.
I'm committed.

70
00:05:51.619 --> 00:05:54.422
I just... before I can
commit to this.

71
00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:00.861
Yeah. All right.

72
00:06:01.895 --> 00:06:05.466
Logan. will you just...
um...

73
00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:07.167
What do you think's
gonna happen. Suzanne?

74
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.602
I mean. what
are you afraid of?

75
00:06:08.636 --> 00:06:11.038
You know what
I'm afraid of!

76
00:06:11.071 --> 00:06:15.075
I just... I'm just not ready.
I can't. I can't.

77
00:06:15.108 --> 00:06:17.010
[sighs]

78
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.516
OK. Just take this. OK?

79
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:23.984
- I don't...
- Just hold onto it. OK?

80
00:06:24.017 --> 00:06:26.153
Just hang on to this.

81
00:06:26.186 --> 00:06:29.523
And you can wear it
when you're ready.

82
00:06:32.826 --> 00:06:34.061
OK?

83
00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.905
[sniffling]

84
00:06:49.176 --> 00:06:51.579
[indistinct chatter]

85
00:06:55.616 --> 00:06:57.184
[man] Hey. Jamie. wait up!

86
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.707
Oh. I think things
may have changed

87
00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.943
since I got engaged.
in about. oh. 10 BC.

88
00:07:22.976 --> 00:07:26.847
but I thought that the
engagement ring was supposed
to go on the finger.

89
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.518
[clears throat] He says
that I need to face my fears.

90
00:07:30.551 --> 00:07:33.654
Ah. well. he's right.

91
00:07:33.687 --> 00:07:36.156
That's easier said than done
when what you fear lives
inside of you.

92
00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:41.962
Mmm... One could argue that
the object of everyone's fear
lives inside them.

93
00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.565
No thank you.

94
00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:47.501
So. is that my
object of fear?

95
00:07:47.535 --> 00:07:51.805
This? No. no. no.
No. this... is a test.

96
00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:55.643
And what's important
are not the results.

97
00:07:55.676 --> 00:08:00.247
What's important is what
you do with the results.

98
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.851
Suzanne. what's ever
inside this envelope...

99
00:08:03.884 --> 00:08:08.822
[chuckles] ...shouldn't
keep you from living your life.

100
00:08:08.856 --> 00:08:11.859
Who would want
to marry someone with a
predisposition for murder?

101
00:08:11.892 --> 00:08:13.894
Well. apparently.
Logan would.

102
00:08:13.927 --> 00:08:15.763
That's because he
doesn't understand.

103
00:08:15.796 --> 00:08:17.831
So... [laughs]
I see. what this is.

104
00:08:17.865 --> 00:08:21.301
is maybe the world's most
intellectually rigorous case
of cold feet.

105
00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:26.740
I'm sure that it is.
I wonder if we can test
for it empirically?

106
00:08:26.774 --> 00:08:31.879
All right. Suzanne. come on.
You have worked so hard.

107
00:08:31.912 --> 00:08:35.849
You've helped so many people
find their way to happiness.

108
00:08:35.883 --> 00:08:37.818
I just want to make sure you
find some for yourself.

109
00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:41.855
- Yeah. OK.
- Oh. wait!
Almost forgot to tell you.

110
00:08:41.889 --> 00:08:44.257
I need your classroom today.
205. for a final.

111
00:08:44.291 --> 00:08:48.662
You're gonna have to move
your section to the science
library classroom.

112
00:08:48.696 --> 00:08:51.865
OK. that's fine.
And thank you for this.

113
00:08:53.801 --> 00:08:55.769
- My pleasure.
- [door shuts]

114
00:08:59.239 --> 00:09:01.208
- Thanks. Julie.
- Thanks.

115
00:09:02.676 --> 00:09:05.312
Oh. Lieutenant Olsen.
Good to see you.

116
00:09:05.345 --> 00:09:07.280
The pleasure's all mine.
Caroline.

117
00:09:07.314 --> 00:09:09.950
Would you like your usual?

118
00:09:09.983 --> 00:09:11.985
- Yeah. please.
- Of course.

119
00:09:15.288 --> 00:09:17.090
Hey. it's Julie. right?

120
00:09:17.124 --> 00:09:19.893
- Hey. Kellen.
- Hey.

121
00:09:21.762 --> 00:09:23.263
[whispers] Jocks!

122
00:09:23.296 --> 00:09:26.266
Uh... Don't you have class
in a few minutes?

123
00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:28.335
Did you memorize my schedule?

124
00:09:28.368 --> 00:09:30.938
No. I just... you know.
I don't normally

125
00:09:30.971 --> 00:09:33.306
see your pretty face
on a Wednesday

126
00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:34.808
since you went
back to school.

127
00:09:34.842 --> 00:09:36.710
Well. you're my last customer.
lieutenant.

128
00:09:36.744 --> 00:09:39.112
It's... it's Michael.

129
00:09:39.146 --> 00:09:44.685
And thank you for. uh...
waiting for me.

130
00:09:44.718 --> 00:09:47.354
Are you giving me
your number. Michael?

131
00:09:47.387 --> 00:09:50.691
- [laughs]
- Uh... Yeah. uh. yeah.

132
00:09:50.724 --> 00:09:55.128
I mean. you know.
in case you need...
assistance some time.

133
00:09:55.162 --> 00:09:58.899
- [tires screeching]
- [crashing]

134
00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:00.768
[groans]

135
00:10:00.801 --> 00:10:04.104
- Hey. you OK?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

136
00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:09.109
Here. get up. Get up.
What's your name?

137
00:10:09.142 --> 00:10:11.011
Ooh! Aah!
Uh. it's Jeremy.

138
00:10:11.044 --> 00:10:12.980
Jeremy.
are you an idiot?

139
00:10:13.013 --> 00:10:15.315
That guy almost hit me!

140
00:10:15.348 --> 00:10:17.350
You're riding on
the wrong side of the road!

141
00:10:17.384 --> 00:10:22.189
Look. I almost just got
hit by a car. and you...
you're yelling at me?

142
00:10:22.222 --> 00:10:23.657
You're texting.

143
00:10:23.691 --> 00:10:27.060
- Oh come on. man!
- It's lieutenant.

144
00:10:27.094 --> 00:10:30.130
Come on. lieutenant...

145
00:10:30.163 --> 00:10:31.832
I'm already late to class.
now what.

146
00:10:31.865 --> 00:10:33.767
are you gonna give me a ticket
for texting while cycling?

147
00:10:33.801 --> 00:10:35.803
- Jeremy?
- Do you know this clown?

148
00:10:35.836 --> 00:10:38.806
He's in my criminal brain
class. What did he do?

149
00:10:38.839 --> 00:10:40.674
He almost got hit
by a car.

150
00:10:40.708 --> 00:10:43.310
Well. shouldn't you be
talking to the driver?

151
00:10:43.343 --> 00:10:45.012
Exactly!

152
00:10:45.045 --> 00:10:47.781
Think you could just
let him off with a warning?

153
00:10:47.815 --> 00:10:49.382
Free latte tomorrow?

154
00:10:51.184 --> 00:10:55.655
Jeremy... wear
a helmet next time.

155
00:10:56.223 --> 00:10:58.058
Thank you.

156
00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.796
That was awesome.
Thank you so much.

157
00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:04.231
What is it with you teenagers?

158
00:11:04.264 --> 00:11:07.234
- Hey. I'm 20.
- Whatever.

159
00:11:07.267 --> 00:11:09.870
What I mean is.
you are so smart in class.

160
00:11:09.903 --> 00:11:13.841
and then as soon
as you leave. you start
acting like total morons.

161
00:11:13.874 --> 00:11:18.078
I don't know. maybe it's
something to do with that
old orbitofrontal cortex?

162
00:11:18.111 --> 00:11:22.750
- Is that what it is?
- Oh. someone's been
doing his homework.

163
00:11:22.783 --> 00:11:25.886
- Hot for teacher. huh?
- Oh...

164
00:11:25.919 --> 00:11:28.421
- How did you know?
- [laughs] Please.

165
00:11:28.455 --> 00:11:32.092
- Is it that obvious?
- Please!

166
00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:35.462
Sorry about the change of venue.
I'm glad you all could find us.

167
00:11:35.495 --> 00:11:40.400
OK. um... So. last week.
we were talking about

168
00:11:40.433 --> 00:11:44.304
the orbitofrontal cortex.

169
00:11:44.337 --> 00:11:47.875
So who can guess which
of these two brains is
that of a criminal?

170
00:11:47.908 --> 00:11:50.343
- Yes?
- The one on the left.

171
00:11:50.377 --> 00:11:55.248
- Why?
- Well. there's less activity
in the orbitofrontal cortex.

172
00:11:55.282 --> 00:11:57.050
Which means?

173
00:11:57.084 --> 00:12:02.890
The subject is not exhibiting.
um. an empathetic response?

174
00:12:02.923 --> 00:12:05.492
And why is that
significant?

175
00:12:07.327 --> 00:12:09.830
- Kellen?
- Um...

176
00:12:09.863 --> 00:12:11.965
I think... I think she
pretty much got it.

177
00:12:11.999 --> 00:12:15.903
So maybe a little more
note-taking and less
social networking?

178
00:12:15.936 --> 00:12:19.239
- Sorry.
- OK. Why is that significant?

179
00:12:19.272 --> 00:12:22.509
- Julie?
- The orbitofrontal cortex

180
00:12:22.542 --> 00:12:26.479
is. uh. part of the brain
that controls the conscience

181
00:12:26.513 --> 00:12:30.350
- and ethical decision-making.
- [Suzanne] Right.

182
00:12:31.819 --> 00:12:33.353
- Oh. OK.
- [Suzanne] Good.

183
00:12:33.386 --> 00:12:36.890
So let's say.
for the sake of argument.

184
00:12:36.924 --> 00:12:40.093
that I was to commit
a violent crime...

185
00:12:49.436 --> 00:12:52.873
Neither a PET brain scan nor a
genetic test would be conducted

186
00:12:52.906 --> 00:12:56.276
to determine how much
time I would spend in jail.

187
00:12:56.309 --> 00:13:03.817
Instead. there's a
chance that I would be given
a different sort of evaluation.

188
00:13:03.851 --> 00:13:07.855
The Psychopathy Test. or
Psychopathic Traits Evaluation.

189
00:13:07.888 --> 00:13:13.126
It's a simple list of traits
possessed by most psychopaths.
scored on a number system.

190
00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.328
OK. it's a bit controversial.

191
00:13:15.362 --> 00:13:19.032
but what's great
is that this test is
actually considered

192
00:13:19.066 --> 00:13:22.970
one of the most important
factors in determining
whether or not

193
00:13:23.003 --> 00:13:26.439
a person has psychopathy.
and its results

194
00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:30.177
have a lot of weight
with parole boards.

195
00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.883
[girls laughing]

196
00:13:37.184 --> 00:13:39.486
[woman] Hannah. are you
going back to the dorm?

197
00:13:42.089 --> 00:13:46.293
So a score of 30 or more

198
00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:49.262
can mean the difference
between a few years

199
00:13:49.296 --> 00:13:53.633
or life in prison.

200
00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:56.236
So let's go around the table.
and we'll just start at the top.

201
00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:57.437
and we'll go through the list.

202
00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:00.040
- Caroline.
- "Inflated ego."

203
00:14:00.073 --> 00:14:02.609
"Mythomania or
compulsive lying."

204
00:14:02.642 --> 00:14:06.046
"Little or no compassion
or guilt."

205
00:14:13.053 --> 00:14:14.955
Hey!

206
00:14:17.991 --> 00:14:21.061
"Unrealistic goal setting."

207
00:14:21.094 --> 00:14:23.030
- [quietly] What's up?
- Number five.

208
00:14:23.063 --> 00:14:24.864
Yeah. what's up?

209
00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:30.470
Oh! Um... "Poor social
interactions or controls."

210
00:14:34.307 --> 00:14:35.508
[scoffs]

211
00:14:37.144 --> 00:14:38.946
[whispers] Pop!

212
00:14:46.954 --> 00:14:48.989
"Shallow emotional
responsiveness."

213
00:14:49.022 --> 00:14:51.158
"Childhood behavioral
difficulties."

214
00:14:51.191 --> 00:14:53.660
- "Inability..."
- "Inability to
accept fault or blame."

215
00:14:53.693 --> 00:14:55.528
OK.

216
00:14:55.562 --> 00:14:58.031
What? Why is
everyone looking at me?

217
00:14:59.599 --> 00:15:02.902
[people screaming]

218
00:15:04.204 --> 00:15:07.140
- Whoa. what was that?!
- [gunshots]

219
00:15:07.174 --> 00:15:09.276
- What is that?
- That was a gun.

220
00:15:09.309 --> 00:15:10.377
[exclaims] Oh. no!

221
00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.045
Calm down.

222
00:15:12.079 --> 00:15:13.713
- Is that what I think it is?
- [woman] That was a gun.

223
00:15:13.746 --> 00:15:16.316
Oh. no.

224
00:15:16.349 --> 00:15:20.720
- [distant bell clanging]
- Professor Hollander!

225
00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:23.590
We need to block the door
and prevent anyone

226
00:15:23.623 --> 00:15:25.658
- from getting in.
- Get the table.

227
00:15:25.692 --> 00:15:29.129
Just move it right
up against the door.

228
00:15:30.663 --> 00:15:33.100
[whimpering]

229
00:15:37.504 --> 00:15:39.039
Please don't shoot.

230
00:15:40.207 --> 00:15:42.175
Please don't shoot.
Can we talk?

231
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:46.713
- What do you want?
- [gun clicks]

232
00:15:46.746 --> 00:15:49.049
What do you want?

233
00:15:51.151 --> 00:15:53.220
Can you let them go. please?

234
00:15:54.587 --> 00:15:56.323
Please let them go?

235
00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:00.427
You two. go.

236
00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.296
- [indistinct chatter]
- Now! Go!

237
00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.999
[woman] Oh. my God!

238
00:16:08.568 --> 00:16:10.470
[door shuts]

239
00:16:13.406 --> 00:16:17.177
- Thank you.
- Where's Suzanne Hollander?

240
00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:19.312
[Suzanne] And how did
that make you feel?

241
00:16:21.414 --> 00:16:24.584
Did it make you angry?
[clears throat]

242
00:16:27.254 --> 00:16:29.189
Yeah. I guess so.

243
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:33.360
Is that why you killed
your mother's cat?

244
00:16:39.466 --> 00:16:41.168
What?

245
00:16:41.201 --> 00:16:44.137
Your mother's cat.
that you smothered.

246
00:16:44.171 --> 00:16:46.005
Is that why you killed it?

247
00:16:48.308 --> 00:16:50.277
I guess so.

248
00:16:52.412 --> 00:16:53.580
And what does that mean?

249
00:16:53.613 --> 00:16:55.515
- What does what mean?
- "I guess so."

250
00:16:55.548 --> 00:16:57.484
It would just be helpful
for me to understand.

251
00:16:57.517 --> 00:16:59.586
Did you kill the cat
because you were angry?

252
00:16:59.619 --> 00:17:01.621
Did you...
did you want revenge?

253
00:17:01.654 --> 00:17:05.325
She loved that cat more
than she loved me.

254
00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:08.295
And what does that mean?
What does "love" mean?

255
00:17:10.697 --> 00:17:13.233
[stammering] I don't know.

256
00:17:16.236 --> 00:17:17.804
But Connor. you need
to understand that love

257
00:17:17.837 --> 00:17:21.541
is something that
two people feel together.

258
00:17:21.574 --> 00:17:25.378
You know. it might be harder
for you to fall in love...

259
00:17:25.412 --> 00:17:28.648
It's not me that has
the hard time falling in love.

260
00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:32.119
OK.

261
00:17:32.152 --> 00:17:34.354
But it might be harder
for you to fall in love

262
00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:40.193
until you believe that
you are worthy of that
love from someone else.

263
00:17:40.227 --> 00:17:44.231
Until you choose to open
yourself up completely.

264
00:17:45.665 --> 00:17:47.400
I mean. love is...

265
00:17:48.668 --> 00:17:53.473
Love is hard.
And it takes compromise.

266
00:17:53.506 --> 00:17:55.675
You will fully
understand that someday.

267
00:17:55.708 --> 00:17:58.511
- Do you?
- I'm sorry. do I what?

268
00:17:58.545 --> 00:18:01.114
Do you understand what love is?

269
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:13.326
- [phone beeps]
- "Campus on lockdown.
gunman on the loose."

270
00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.728
- I got the same text.
- It says there's only one?

271
00:18:15.762 --> 00:18:18.398
Uh. it says one gunman.
described as dark hair.

272
00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:22.335
twenty-something male.
thin build. approximately
five foot ten.

273
00:18:22.369 --> 00:18:24.704
- I don't...
- [gunshots]

274
00:18:24.737 --> 00:18:26.473
[shrieks] He's coming!

275
00:18:26.506 --> 00:18:28.508
- [Jeremy grunting]
- OK. OK. you guys.

276
00:18:28.541 --> 00:18:30.277
we need to get to the
back of the classroom.

277
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:32.412
and get to a lower level.
Go! Get...

278
00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:36.816
Jeremy. look.
I know how you're feeling.
no time to panic...

279
00:18:36.849 --> 00:18:39.519
- OK. OK.
- [distant siren wailing]

280
00:18:39.552 --> 00:18:42.155
- What...
- What happened?

281
00:18:42.189 --> 00:18:43.923
- Help me get him up.
- Oh. my gosh. what happened?

282
00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:46.393
[grunting] Let's go. Move.

283
00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:50.330
- [overlapping chatter]
- Go. go. go!

284
00:18:50.363 --> 00:18:52.399
- OK. go!
- Go!

285
00:18:52.432 --> 00:18:55.368
[sirens approaching]

286
00:19:07.247 --> 00:19:09.916
[people shouting. screaming]

287
00:19:33.473 --> 00:19:36.876
- [woman sobbing]
- [rattles door]

288
00:19:43.383 --> 00:19:45.352
[horn blasting]

289
00:19:48.655 --> 00:19:52.392
[siren wailing]

290
00:19:56.963 --> 00:19:59.799
[man] Keep going!

291
00:19:59.832 --> 00:20:02.235
- Hey. Jen. what's the status?
- I just spoke to campus police.

292
00:20:02.269 --> 00:20:04.371
They've sent a text alert
to every student on campus.

293
00:20:04.404 --> 00:20:06.639
but they need to go around
and make sure that everyone's
staying in their dorms.

294
00:20:06.673 --> 00:20:08.475
OK. good. How many
are still in there?

295
00:20:08.508 --> 00:20:10.910
This is every class scheduled
to be in the science center

296
00:20:10.943 --> 00:20:14.481
when the shooting started.
Could be as many as 25
still unaccounted for.

297
00:20:14.514 --> 00:20:18.385
Caroline... [sighs] OK.

298
00:20:18.418 --> 00:20:22.422
Go to where they set up
triage. find out who
from this list is still inside.

299
00:20:22.455 --> 00:20:25.758
If there is hostages. we need
to find out how many. Go.

300
00:20:25.792 --> 00:20:28.828
Wait. Jen.
What's the head count?

301
00:20:28.861 --> 00:20:32.332
Reports are pretty vague.
but we think
maybe five are dead.

302
00:20:32.365 --> 00:20:34.701
at least another
ten injured.

303
00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:36.469
Is he just shooting randomly?

304
00:20:36.503 --> 00:20:38.338
I mean. what are...
what's going on here?

305
00:20:38.371 --> 00:20:40.673
It's strange. All the witnesses
said it was almost like

306
00:20:40.707 --> 00:20:42.742
he was looking for someone.

307
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:45.478
All right. get out of here.

308
00:20:46.879 --> 00:20:49.849
[man] Please. just calm down.

309
00:20:49.882 --> 00:20:51.951
[woman on TV] This is Suzanne
Block. reporting on the scene

310
00:20:51.984 --> 00:20:55.288
where panic has erupted due
to a gunman firing shots

311
00:20:55.322 --> 00:20:57.757
on the campus of nearby
Gambles College.

312
00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.726
An unknown number of victims
have been injured

313
00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:02.395
and local emergency units
have rushed to the scene

314
00:21:02.429 --> 00:21:04.431
to assess what witnesses
have confirmed

315
00:21:04.464 --> 00:21:07.867
to be a hostage situation
here inside the school.

316
00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:11.538
Just go to the back.
Keep going.

317
00:21:11.571 --> 00:21:13.039
Careful. careful.
Go to the back.

318
00:21:13.072 --> 00:21:15.274
All the way
to the back. come on.

319
00:21:18.745 --> 00:21:20.647
[indistinct chatter]

320
00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.715
- You guys. it's fine.
Keep going.
- Shh!

321
00:21:22.749 --> 00:21:24.951
[Suzanne] OK. you guys split up.

322
00:21:24.984 --> 00:21:26.886
Go to different sides.
Different sides.

323
00:21:26.919 --> 00:21:29.489
- Stay down. stay down.
- [Jeremy groaning]

324
00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.359
There. OK.

325
00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.027
- [grunts]
- All right.

326
00:21:35.061 --> 00:21:36.663
You know... [coughs]

327
00:21:36.696 --> 00:21:39.766
...I always had a huge
crush on you. [groans]

328
00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:43.603
Never thought you'd actually
be taking my shirt off. though.

329
00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:46.339
There's no cell service
down here.

330
00:21:46.373 --> 00:21:50.109
[crying] I can't die
like this! I've got kids!

331
00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:52.479
I need. like. a piece of
cloth or something to clot.

332
00:21:52.512 --> 00:21:56.449
- Uh. I have a hat.
- That'll work. That'll work.

333
00:21:56.483 --> 00:21:59.652
Kellen. finger.
Put your hand down.

334
00:21:59.686 --> 00:22:01.521
How do we know he's not
gonna find us down here?

335
00:22:01.554 --> 00:22:03.356
Because we blocked
the only entrance to
the science library. OK?

336
00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:06.893
- [groans]
- There've got to be
other ways in.

337
00:22:06.926 --> 00:22:09.896
We are just gonna sit
here and wait for the
police to get here. all right?

338
00:22:11.731 --> 00:22:14.667
- [groans loudly]
- You're all right.

339
00:22:28.881 --> 00:22:30.583
Come on. doc.

340
00:22:30.617 --> 00:22:34.687
I think you do know where
Suzanne Hollander is.

341
00:22:34.721 --> 00:22:36.589
- I think she's escaped...
- No. no one can escape.

342
00:22:36.623 --> 00:22:39.426
I've locked us all in.
Now. where is she?

343
00:22:44.797 --> 00:22:47.500
[cell phone buzzing]

344
00:22:55.708 --> 00:22:58.144
How long have you
had this thing?

345
00:23:01.814 --> 00:23:04.684
"Are you all right?
There was a shooting
at Gambles College."

346
00:23:04.717 --> 00:23:07.454
Yadda. yadda. yadda.
Yadda. yadda...

347
00:23:12.892 --> 00:23:15.061
Suzanne Hollander.

348
00:23:15.094 --> 00:23:16.729
"Thanks for our little chat.

349
00:23:16.763 --> 00:23:19.566
I'll be happy to use
the science library."

350
00:23:25.672 --> 00:23:27.474
Thanks. doc.

351
00:23:30.743 --> 00:23:32.812
Wait. where are you going?

352
00:23:32.845 --> 00:23:34.080
Where are you going?!

353
00:23:34.113 --> 00:23:35.648
[door opens]

354
00:23:35.682 --> 00:23:37.016
[sighs]

355
00:23:38.618 --> 00:23:40.620
[door shuts]

356
00:24:02.742 --> 00:24:05.745
[Connor] I think
you've got some
mommy issues of your own.

357
00:24:05.778 --> 00:24:08.080
and that's the reason
you became a shrink.

358
00:24:08.114 --> 00:24:11.117
I'm not a shrink.
I'm a doctor.

359
00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:14.554
and I'm in research.
Connor. there's
a big difference.

360
00:24:14.587 --> 00:24:16.756
All right. but that
doesn't answer my question.

361
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:19.058
You have mommy issues.
don't you?

362
00:24:20.259 --> 00:24:22.529
What makes you say that?

363
00:24:24.664 --> 00:24:27.099
No pictures of your mom and dad.

364
00:24:29.201 --> 00:24:30.637
Why?

365
00:24:33.005 --> 00:24:35.975
So. what's your issue
with your parents?

366
00:24:36.843 --> 00:24:39.712
[clears throat]

367
00:24:39.746 --> 00:24:41.948
- What do you want to
be when you grow up?
- Come on...

368
00:24:41.981 --> 00:24:44.517
Don't change the subject.

369
00:24:44.551 --> 00:24:47.153
OK. how about this?

370
00:24:47.186 --> 00:24:49.522
A little quid pro quo.
Do you know what that means?

371
00:24:49.556 --> 00:24:51.891
Do you I look stupid to you?

372
00:24:52.792 --> 00:24:56.262
No... you do not look stupid.

373
00:24:56.295 --> 00:24:58.531
All right. fine.
quid pro quo.

374
00:24:58.565 --> 00:25:01.000
Tell me something
about your mother.

375
00:25:01.033 --> 00:25:03.903
OK. I will admit

376
00:25:03.936 --> 00:25:08.074
that I have...
issues with my parents.

377
00:25:08.107 --> 00:25:09.809
I knew it.

378
00:25:09.842 --> 00:25:13.245
My issue. Connor. is that
I didn't really have them.

379
00:25:14.681 --> 00:25:16.248
I grew up in the system.

380
00:25:17.684 --> 00:25:20.953
- The system?
- Foster care.

381
00:25:20.987 --> 00:25:23.756
I bounced around a lot.

382
00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:26.726
The longest I ever stayed
with a family was one year.

383
00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.129
Your turn.

384
00:25:30.162 --> 00:25:33.032
What do you want to do
when you graduate?

385
00:25:33.065 --> 00:25:35.001
I want to teach.

386
00:25:35.034 --> 00:25:37.303
You want to teach?
Do you think that's
something you'd be good at?

387
00:25:37.336 --> 00:25:39.906
No. no. no. I don't
want to be a teacher.

388
00:25:39.939 --> 00:25:43.142
They don't teach.
They indoctrinate.

389
00:25:44.644 --> 00:25:46.312
I want to...

390
00:25:48.014 --> 00:25:50.883
I want to really
teach people something.

391
00:25:55.154 --> 00:25:57.089
You guys. we've got
to keep moving. OK?

392
00:25:57.123 --> 00:25:58.925
We're like sitting
ducks down here.

393
00:25:58.958 --> 00:26:01.060
Jeremy's dying over here!
Can we give him a minute?

394
00:26:01.093 --> 00:26:03.062
Yeah. and I don't
want to end up like him!

395
00:26:03.095 --> 00:26:06.933
You guys.
nobody is dying!
Come on!

396
00:26:06.966 --> 00:26:09.068
Jeremy. I'm sorry.

397
00:26:09.101 --> 00:26:12.304
I'm sorry. OK? We're gonna
get you out. I promise.

398
00:26:12.338 --> 00:26:15.374
but that's not gonna
happen if we're just
sitting in the boiler room!

399
00:26:15.407 --> 00:26:19.646
- Do you have a better plan?
- [sighs]

400
00:26:24.283 --> 00:26:27.687
This is Olsen.
Put him through.

401
00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.789
Yeah. Lieutenant Olsen.
Who am I speaking to?

402
00:26:29.822 --> 00:26:32.191
All right. I need you
to listen very carefully.
Lieutenant Olsen.

403
00:26:32.224 --> 00:26:34.627
I have hostages.

404
00:26:34.661 --> 00:26:36.963
I may or may not
kill some of them.

405
00:26:36.996 --> 00:26:39.999
But if I see a single
cop come in here.
I'm killing all of them.

406
00:26:40.032 --> 00:26:44.103
- You understand?
- Yes. it's clear.
Uh. tell me your name.

407
00:26:45.104 --> 00:26:46.706
Why should I?

408
00:26:46.739 --> 00:26:48.775
So. uh. we can have
a civil conversation.

409
00:26:48.808 --> 00:26:50.710
I'd like to know
who I'm speaking to.

410
00:26:50.743 --> 00:26:53.179
I have no interest in having
a civil conversation with you.

411
00:26:53.212 --> 00:26:57.416
OK. that's fine. That's fine.
you have all the power.

412
00:26:57.449 --> 00:27:01.053
Just thought maybe we
could. you know. come to an
understanding or something.

413
00:27:01.087 --> 00:27:03.422
[laughs] I know
I have all the power.

414
00:27:03.455 --> 00:27:06.092
So if I see a single cop
come in here.

415
00:27:06.125 --> 00:27:09.762
the blood's on your hands.
You understand that?

416
00:27:11.998 --> 00:27:14.033
Yes. I understand.

417
00:27:16.002 --> 00:27:17.970
Good.

418
00:27:23.375 --> 00:27:25.812
- [crying]
- [Suzanne] Bonnie...

419
00:27:26.913 --> 00:27:28.715
Bonnie!

420
00:27:28.748 --> 00:27:30.917
I know that this is hard.

421
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:34.286
But you need to be
strong and stay calm. OK?

422
00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:39.158
All right. one of us needs
to go upstairs and see if
we can get any cell service.

423
00:27:39.191 --> 00:27:40.760
See if we can call for help.

424
00:27:40.793 --> 00:27:45.264
- That's a good idea. Right?
- Yeah... yeah. I agree.

425
00:27:45.297 --> 00:27:47.700
I mean. if you're
willing. Kellen...

426
00:27:47.734 --> 00:27:49.836
- [Suzanne] You guys. stop it!
- [Jeremy groaning]

427
00:27:49.869 --> 00:27:53.940
Hey... No one is going
anywhere. all right?

428
00:27:53.973 --> 00:27:56.475
You're my responsibility.
I can't allow it.

429
00:27:56.508 --> 00:27:58.144
It's too risky. OK?

430
00:27:58.177 --> 00:28:00.279
We're just gonna stay
here and wait for the police.

431
00:28:00.312 --> 00:28:02.348
All right?

432
00:28:05.484 --> 00:28:08.788
Jen. who just put that call
through? Who was that from?

433
00:28:08.821 --> 00:28:11.157
I don't know. dispatch just said
it was related to the shooting.

434
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:13.425
- That was the shooter.
- You made contact?

435
00:28:13.459 --> 00:28:15.728
No. he made contact.
He's got hostages.

436
00:28:15.762 --> 00:28:17.496
So. what are we going to do?

437
00:28:17.529 --> 00:28:20.299
Uh... I don't know. um...

438
00:28:20.332 --> 00:28:23.502
All right. we gotta find a
place where we can set up shop.

439
00:28:23.535 --> 00:28:25.905
You know. somewhere
we can get. uh...

440
00:28:25.938 --> 00:28:28.374
You know. like a classroom
or something. you know.
Figure out a plan.

441
00:28:28.407 --> 00:28:31.911
We're setting up a
triage area and a command
center in the cafeteria.

442
00:28:31.944 --> 00:28:33.379
OK. good. I'll
look at these.

443
00:28:33.412 --> 00:28:36.315
And in the meantime.
you go to campus security.

444
00:28:36.348 --> 00:28:40.186
Get me any footage of any
security anywhere on campus.

445
00:28:40.219 --> 00:28:41.487
OK? And where's
my SWAT team?

446
00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.289
They say they're still
about 45 minutes out.

447
00:28:43.322 --> 00:28:44.824
What? Are you kidding me?

448
00:28:44.857 --> 00:28:46.826
- Go get 'em now! Go!
- Yes. sir.

449
00:28:46.859 --> 00:28:49.228
Geez. Damn. we are
in the sticks!

450
00:28:49.261 --> 00:28:51.097
Hey. you the officer
in charge?

451
00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:55.134
Uh. yeah. Uh...
What. are you FBI?

452
00:28:55.167 --> 00:28:56.969
Not exactly.
I need to get in here.

453
00:28:57.003 --> 00:28:58.838
Uh. sorry. no one gets...
Who are you?

454
00:28:58.871 --> 00:29:00.907
Gunnery Sergeant Logan
Garrison. US Marine Corps.

455
00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:02.174
Yeah? Where did you come from?

456
00:29:02.208 --> 00:29:04.043
That doesn't matter.
I saw this on TV.

457
00:29:04.076 --> 00:29:05.878
We have a
hostage situation...

458
00:29:05.912 --> 00:29:08.881
How many people you
still got in there?

459
00:29:08.915 --> 00:29:12.051
- Ten. maybe more.
- What the hell
are you doing?

460
00:29:12.084 --> 00:29:15.454
- Where's your SWAT team?
You got a negotiator?
- They're still 45 minutes out.

461
00:29:15.487 --> 00:29:17.957
You don't got 45 minutes!
Those people will
be dead by then!

462
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:19.325
They're not gonna be...
Excuse me. do you mind...

463
00:29:19.358 --> 00:29:22.328
Yes. they will be dead
by then and you know it!

464
00:29:22.361 --> 00:29:25.965
OK. listen... I've done
two tours in Afghanistan.

465
00:29:25.998 --> 00:29:29.135
OK. I've been through
hostage negotiation.
I trained special ops.

466
00:29:29.168 --> 00:29:31.070
I'm the best option
you've got right now.

467
00:29:31.103 --> 00:29:33.505
Forget it.
Nobody goes in.

468
00:29:33.539 --> 00:29:35.341
All right. hey...

469
00:29:35.374 --> 00:29:38.310
Do you have someone
special in your life?

470
00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:43.015
What's that got to do
with anything?

471
00:29:43.049 --> 00:29:45.384
'Cause the woman I love
is in that building right now.

472
00:29:45.417 --> 00:29:49.255
OK. I'm not going to
stand by and wait for some
nut job to destroy my life.

473
00:29:49.288 --> 00:29:53.525
I'm going in there.
whether you let me or not.

474
00:30:06.372 --> 00:30:08.007
Come on.

475
00:30:08.975 --> 00:30:10.542
Try switching spots with me.

476
00:30:10.576 --> 00:30:12.278
You're fine. You're fine.

477
00:30:12.311 --> 00:30:14.213
You got him? OK.

478
00:30:32.464 --> 00:30:35.067
[Connor] have you always
had a thing for psychos?

479
00:30:36.969 --> 00:30:40.506
What makes you think I
have a thing for psychos?

480
00:30:40.539 --> 00:30:42.975
Well. we go overtime
every single week.

481
00:30:46.345 --> 00:30:48.915
I don't have a
thing for psychos.

482
00:30:50.216 --> 00:30:51.918
Nor do I have a thing for you.

483
00:30:53.685 --> 00:30:58.090
I'm trying to learn
about you so I can help you.

484
00:31:00.492 --> 00:31:03.529
Which is why I really need you
to talk about Thanksgiving.

485
00:31:06.665 --> 00:31:08.500
I don't want to talk
about that.

486
00:31:10.302 --> 00:31:13.239
We need to talk about
what happened with your mom.

487
00:31:18.978 --> 00:31:20.913
Talk about Thanksgiving
in general.

488
00:31:20.947 --> 00:31:25.918
Anything that you can remember.
want to talk about...

489
00:31:25.952 --> 00:31:29.088
Well. from the moment
I got off the plane.
she set in on me. you know.

490
00:31:29.121 --> 00:31:30.589
like the clothes I was wearing.

491
00:31:30.622 --> 00:31:34.393
the music I listened to.
my grades. everything.

492
00:31:34.426 --> 00:31:40.032
- Go on.
- Well. Thanksgiving
was the same as usual.

493
00:31:40.066 --> 00:31:42.234
We went to my aunt's house.
the turkey was dry.

494
00:31:42.268 --> 00:31:48.107
everyone was sappy about
what they were thankful for...

495
00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:50.542
And what were you thankful for?

496
00:31:55.447 --> 00:31:57.249
Uh...

497
00:31:58.484 --> 00:32:00.086
You.

498
00:32:08.494 --> 00:32:10.029
[Logan] Any luck
with the cell phones?

499
00:32:10.062 --> 00:32:11.497
No. they go right
to voice mail.

500
00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:12.965
Seems like they don't
have any reception.

501
00:32:12.999 --> 00:32:14.300
Must be underground.
which means they're

502
00:32:14.333 --> 00:32:15.501
on the cellar level
or in the steam tunnels.

503
00:32:15.534 --> 00:32:17.036
- You alumni?
- Yeah. Class of '92.

504
00:32:17.069 --> 00:32:18.537
I spent a lot of time
in those tunnels.

505
00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:20.306
[phone ringing]

506
00:32:20.339 --> 00:32:24.243
Good. they got this set up.
Jen. thank you very much.

507
00:32:24.276 --> 00:32:27.713
The steam tunnels connect most
of the campus. but only some
of them are passable.

508
00:32:27.746 --> 00:32:30.549
Old chemistry lab connects
to the new science center
through the library.

509
00:32:30.582 --> 00:32:32.384
That's original structure.

510
00:32:32.418 --> 00:32:34.987
Isn't there some way to the
tunnels through the lower level?

511
00:32:35.021 --> 00:32:37.756
No. there isn't. The only way
in and out of these tunnels

512
00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:41.060
is from the stairwell
on the ground level.
here and here.

513
00:32:41.093 --> 00:32:44.496
- Lieutenant. didn't you say
the shooter called you?
- Yeah.

514
00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:48.100
- Yeah.
- Well. if he has hostages.

515
00:32:48.134 --> 00:32:51.003
and none of them have cell
service. how did he call you?

516
00:32:52.471 --> 00:32:55.007
- Maybe he's bluffing.
- Maybe he hasn't
got to 'em yet.

517
00:32:55.041 --> 00:32:56.375
I gotta get down there
before he does.

518
00:32:56.408 --> 00:32:58.510
Whoa. whoa...
Jen. gimme your radio.

519
00:33:00.046 --> 00:33:02.181
- In case you need backup.
- Thanks.

520
00:33:02.214 --> 00:33:03.749
Got a weapon?

521
00:33:03.782 --> 00:33:06.652
[sighs] Why am I
not surprised?

522
00:33:29.641 --> 00:33:32.744
[Caroline] That's it.
I'm leaving.

523
00:33:33.712 --> 00:33:35.781
Who's coming?

524
00:33:38.284 --> 00:33:40.519
- Fine.
- Caroline. no. it's not...

525
00:33:40.552 --> 00:33:43.689
Don't boss me around. OK?

526
00:33:43.722 --> 00:33:46.058
I'm not some 20-year-old kid.

527
00:33:46.092 --> 00:33:48.494
- [whispering] No. don't...
- I'm going for help.

528
00:33:48.527 --> 00:33:50.129
No. Caroline. stop!

529
00:33:54.833 --> 00:33:56.268
[whispering]
Why do we have to...

530
00:33:56.302 --> 00:33:58.137
[whispering] You guys stay.
let her go.

531
00:34:24.430 --> 00:34:26.365
[whimpering]

532
00:34:30.469 --> 00:34:33.239
You know. 20 years on the job...

533
00:34:33.272 --> 00:34:35.741
...I never once discharged
my firearm. Not once.

534
00:34:35.774 --> 00:34:37.576
[phone ringing]

535
00:34:39.578 --> 00:34:42.581
And then this happens
in our little town.

536
00:34:44.816 --> 00:34:46.685
I know.

537
00:34:49.755 --> 00:34:51.590
[cell phone beeps]

538
00:34:53.359 --> 00:34:56.228
We have access to the security
cameras in the library.

539
00:34:57.563 --> 00:34:59.431
I'm signing on now.

540
00:35:02.434 --> 00:35:04.836
Lieutenant. look!

541
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:06.705
Give that to Leanne.

542
00:35:11.277 --> 00:35:13.545
[cell phone ringing]

543
00:35:15.347 --> 00:35:17.449
That's her.

544
00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:20.452
- Caroline?
- Michael?

545
00:35:20.486 --> 00:35:22.521
Michael. can you hear me?
It's Caroline!

546
00:35:22.554 --> 00:35:25.857
- Caroline. you OK?
- I'm... I'm trapped
in the library.

547
00:35:25.891 --> 00:35:27.693
He's locked us in!

548
00:35:27.726 --> 00:35:29.528
Calm down. It's gonna be OK.

549
00:35:29.561 --> 00:35:32.831
- Help is on the way.
- I couldn't just sit
and wait anymore.

550
00:35:32.864 --> 00:35:34.700
I know. I'm looking
at you right now.

551
00:35:34.733 --> 00:35:37.503
I'm looking at
the security cam.

552
00:35:37.536 --> 00:35:40.939
Now. listen... how many people
are still in there?

553
00:35:40.972 --> 00:35:43.509
Um... five that I know of.

554
00:35:43.542 --> 00:35:46.745
Listen to me.
Jeremy's been shot.

555
00:35:46.778 --> 00:35:50.216
- [clattering]
- [gasps]

556
00:35:50.249 --> 00:35:51.617
[whispering] I think
someone's coming!

557
00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:52.918
You have to find
a place to hide.

558
00:35:52.951 --> 00:35:54.620
Right now. Caroline.
right now! OK?

559
00:35:54.653 --> 00:35:57.256
Please. just find a place
where you can be quiet. OK?

560
00:36:04.896 --> 00:36:06.632
What is this?
What's going on? What is this?

561
00:36:06.665 --> 00:36:08.367
- I don't know.
we must've lost power.
- Fix it!

562
00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.702
- Caroline? You OK?
- [door opening]

563
00:36:10.736 --> 00:36:12.571
He... he's coming.

564
00:36:24.816 --> 00:36:26.352
Logan. do you copy?

565
00:36:32.324 --> 00:36:35.427
Would somebody please tell me
what's going on in there?!

566
00:37:16.067 --> 00:37:21.540
[whimpers. sobs]

567
00:38:32.711 --> 00:38:34.079
- Shh.
- [muffled gasp]

568
00:38:34.112 --> 00:38:35.814
Be very quiet.
I'm here to help.

569
00:38:35.847 --> 00:38:38.450
I'm gonna get you out. You
just can't make a sound. OK?

570
00:38:38.484 --> 00:38:40.419
Shh.

571
00:38:42.421 --> 00:38:44.956
There are five others
still in the boiler room.

572
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:48.427
- Suzanne Hollander?
- Yes. I'm in her class.

573
00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:52.464
Wait. A boy is injured.
Jeremy Waters.

574
00:38:52.498 --> 00:38:53.832
He got shot.

575
00:38:54.466 --> 00:38:55.667
OK.

576
00:39:15.787 --> 00:39:17.022
[Caroline screams]

577
00:39:19.991 --> 00:39:21.993
I said no cops!

578
00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:26.698
Caroline...

579
00:39:26.732 --> 00:39:28.667
Oh. I never should
have let her go!

580
00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:30.569
[gun clicking]

581
00:39:38.977 --> 00:39:40.679
I gotta go see if
I can help her...

582
00:39:40.712 --> 00:39:42.681
No. no. you can't.
He has guns. You don't.

583
00:39:42.714 --> 00:39:45.417
I can't let him hurt
somebody because of me.

584
00:39:45.451 --> 00:39:48.086
Wait. what do you mean.
"because of you?"

585
00:39:48.119 --> 00:39:50.689
Do you mind if we
talk about the incident?

586
00:39:55.126 --> 00:40:00.131
Uh. it was... It was the Friday
after Thanksgiving.

587
00:40:00.165 --> 00:40:06.705
And I was just watching TV. some
cop show marathon or something.

588
00:40:06.738 --> 00:40:09.207
Minding my own business.
when she busts in on me

589
00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.643
and just starts laying
into me again. you know like.

590
00:40:11.677 --> 00:40:14.580
"Shouldn't you be out?
Why don't you hang out
with the other kids?

591
00:40:14.613 --> 00:40:17.015
Don't you have friends
from high school you can visit?"

592
00:40:17.048 --> 00:40:21.219
And I try to tell her that
all the kids that I went to
high school with are idiots.

593
00:40:21.252 --> 00:40:23.555
Like. it's just how I feel.

594
00:40:23.589 --> 00:40:25.023
And...

595
00:40:26.692 --> 00:40:29.060
...she thumps me
with a magazine!

596
00:40:29.094 --> 00:40:31.663
Rolls up a magazine
and hits me with it.

597
00:40:31.697 --> 00:40:36.702
like... like... like
I'm some kind of animal.

598
00:40:39.871 --> 00:40:43.208
Like... like I'm
her stupid cat.

599
00:40:44.109 --> 00:40:46.177
And then what happened?

600
00:40:47.979 --> 00:40:50.181
I got up.

601
00:40:53.585 --> 00:40:57.623
She starts backing up
like she's scared of me
or something.

602
00:40:58.724 --> 00:41:01.960
And... and I say...

603
00:41:01.993 --> 00:41:05.063
"If you want to hit me.
you should just go
ahead and do it."

604
00:41:05.797 --> 00:41:07.499
And did she?

605
00:41:07.533 --> 00:41:10.035
No. she backed up
into an end table.

606
00:41:10.068 --> 00:41:14.573
and. um...
knocked over a lamp.

607
00:41:14.606 --> 00:41:17.709
But you kept walking
toward her?

608
00:41:17.743 --> 00:41:21.980
Yeah. she... she. like.
tried to pick the lamp up.

609
00:41:22.013 --> 00:41:24.816
but I grabbed
hold of her...

610
00:41:25.784 --> 00:41:27.719
[clears throat]

611
00:41:29.955 --> 00:41:31.757
...and I said to her.

612
00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:34.760
"If you want to hit me. you
should just go ahead and do it."

613
00:41:36.762 --> 00:41:39.264
We have to move. OK?

614
00:41:39.297 --> 00:41:42.868
Jeremy. if I help you.
can you walk?

615
00:41:42.901 --> 00:41:44.670
- Yeah. I think so.
- OK. Ready?

616
00:41:44.703 --> 00:41:46.705
[both] One. two. three...

617
00:41:46.738 --> 00:41:48.840
[all grunting]

618
00:41:48.874 --> 00:41:51.610
- Go.
- [Jeremy grunting]

619
00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:55.681
Thank you.

620
00:41:55.714 --> 00:41:58.950
Michael... thank you.

621
00:41:58.984 --> 00:42:01.086
- I was so scared.
- Don't thank me. thank Logan.

622
00:42:01.119 --> 00:42:04.222
Thank you so much.

623
00:42:04.255 --> 00:42:06.925
- Jeremy...
- We're doing all we can.

624
00:42:06.958 --> 00:42:08.293
We're trying to get somebody
in there now. Is...

625
00:42:08.326 --> 00:42:11.329
I'm sorry. it's... it's him.
It's the shooter.

626
00:42:11.362 --> 00:42:14.232
Ken. can you
take care of her. please?

627
00:42:14.265 --> 00:42:15.634
Ma'am. this way.

628
00:42:15.667 --> 00:42:17.102
This is Olsen.

629
00:42:17.135 --> 00:42:19.104
I told you not to send
any cops in here.

630
00:42:19.137 --> 00:42:21.072
and that's specifically
what you did!

631
00:42:21.106 --> 00:42:22.674
I don't know what
you're talking about.

632
00:42:22.708 --> 00:42:24.943
- Don't lie to me.
- Well. I think you lied to me.

633
00:42:24.976 --> 00:42:27.913
I don't think you
have any more hostages.

634
00:42:27.946 --> 00:42:31.049
Really? You really
want to be that cavalier

635
00:42:31.082 --> 00:42:33.051
about innocent people's lives?

636
00:42:35.086 --> 00:42:36.988
[phone clatters]

637
00:42:44.229 --> 00:42:46.865
[Bonnie] What are
you doing? Go!

638
00:42:46.898 --> 00:42:48.333
Is it locked?

639
00:42:48.366 --> 00:42:50.736
[Suzanne] You guys.
head to the steam tunnels.

640
00:42:50.769 --> 00:42:52.103
Steam tunnels. Straight back.
Straight back.

641
00:42:52.137 --> 00:42:54.640
It's the door that says
"don't enter."

642
00:42:56.307 --> 00:42:58.677
[Jeremy groaning]

643
00:43:00.746 --> 00:43:02.848
Suzanne.

644
00:43:05.083 --> 00:43:07.252
So she smacked me.

645
00:43:08.353 --> 00:43:10.856
I say. "Hit me again."

646
00:43:10.889 --> 00:43:13.024
So she says she's
gonna call the cops.

647
00:43:13.058 --> 00:43:17.796
I say. "Hit me again or
I'll give you something
to call the cops about."

648
00:43:20.666 --> 00:43:22.267
And did you?

649
00:43:23.101 --> 00:43:25.103
Did you hit your mother?

650
00:43:27.438 --> 00:43:29.307
Did you hit her?

651
00:43:36.748 --> 00:43:39.117
[crying] I didn't mean to.

652
00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:45.657
I'm not...
I'm not crazy. am I?

653
00:43:45.691 --> 00:43:49.027
I... I can be fixed.
I can change. right?

654
00:43:53.765 --> 00:43:56.367
Connor. I'm gonna
need you to back up.

655
00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:07.412
Are you scared of me?

656
00:44:10.281 --> 00:44:12.684
Professor! Professor.
come on. let's go!

657
00:44:12.718 --> 00:44:13.852
Come on!

658
00:44:32.337 --> 00:44:34.172
Open the door!

659
00:44:34.205 --> 00:44:35.907
Do you know him?

660
00:44:35.941 --> 00:44:37.375
He was a former research
subject of mine.

661
00:44:37.408 --> 00:44:40.912
- So all of this
is about you?
- [pounding on door]

662
00:44:40.946 --> 00:44:45.316
OK. so how would you like
to come in next Thursday.
like at 11:00?

663
00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:47.018
I feel so weird.

664
00:44:49.187 --> 00:44:53.825
I tell you all about myself
in here. and you don't tell
me anything about you.

665
00:44:53.859 --> 00:44:58.864
OK. OK.
What do you want to know?

666
00:44:58.897 --> 00:45:01.066
I want to know how it felt to
watch your mom kill your father.

667
00:45:03.902 --> 00:45:06.872
I'm sorry. how did you...
how did you know that?

668
00:45:06.905 --> 00:45:09.207
It's the digital age.
Suzanne.

669
00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:13.945
Everything you need to know
is just a few keystrokes away.

670
00:45:13.979 --> 00:45:16.114
I think that you need to go.

671
00:45:17.382 --> 00:45:19.951
No. that's not fair.
We had an agreement.

672
00:45:19.985 --> 00:45:22.253
Quid pro quo. You can't cheat
on your end of the deal.

673
00:45:22.287 --> 00:45:24.489
Connor. you're
crossing a line.

674
00:45:24.522 --> 00:45:26.491
No. I'm just asking.
I just want to know.

675
00:45:26.524 --> 00:45:29.928
like how it felt
to watch your mom shoot
your father in the head.

676
00:45:29.961 --> 00:45:34.132
I mean. like. is it true
that people defecate
when they get shot?

677
00:45:34.165 --> 00:45:37.468
Did your father crap himself
when your mom shot him?

678
00:45:38.503 --> 00:45:41.773
He did. didn't he?

679
00:45:41.807 --> 00:45:44.409
So it wasn't just his blood
you were covered in. it was...

680
00:45:44.442 --> 00:45:46.778
- You need to leave right now.
- It was his... What?

681
00:45:46.812 --> 00:45:48.513
- Get out!
- I'm just...

682
00:45:48.546 --> 00:45:50.248
I'll tell them you were
physically abusive.

683
00:45:50.281 --> 00:45:52.818
Fine! Connor. I don't care!

684
00:45:52.851 --> 00:45:55.120
Don't you get it. Suzanne?
You're just like me.

685
00:45:55.153 --> 00:45:56.988
We both have crazy moms.

686
00:45:57.022 --> 00:46:01.559
So you... you think that your
mother is crazy like mine?

687
00:46:01.592 --> 00:46:04.029
No. no. no. I think
you're crazy like me.

688
00:46:04.062 --> 00:46:06.231
So our moms gotta be
kinda similar. right?

689
00:46:06.264 --> 00:46:09.400
I never want
to see you again.

690
00:46:09.434 --> 00:46:11.236
You need to go.

691
00:46:11.269 --> 00:46:13.104
Oh. you can't
kick me out like that.

692
00:46:13.138 --> 00:46:15.540
Get out! Now!

693
00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:21.279
You'll see me again.

694
00:46:22.147 --> 00:46:23.849
[scoffs]

695
00:46:27.853 --> 00:46:30.121
How does it feel. Suzanne?

696
00:46:30.155 --> 00:46:32.991
To know that it's because of you
that all these people are dead?

697
00:46:33.024 --> 00:46:35.393
- What did you do?
- [Jeremy] She didn't
do anything!

698
00:46:35.426 --> 00:46:37.195
He's a psychopath.

699
00:46:37.228 --> 00:46:39.397
- Haven't you been listening...
- Stop arguing. you guys.

700
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:41.266
We have to get
out of here. all right?

701
00:46:41.299 --> 00:46:43.368
We need to get
Jeremy out of here.
He's losing a lot of blood.

702
00:46:43.401 --> 00:46:46.137
Come on. put your arm around me.
Let's go.

703
00:46:50.375 --> 00:46:52.443
Come on.

704
00:46:53.444 --> 00:46:56.047
[Julie] Come on. keep going.

705
00:47:07.092 --> 00:47:09.094
[exclaims]

706
00:47:10.495 --> 00:47:14.632
Keep walking.
Go. go. Go!

707
00:47:14.665 --> 00:47:16.301
Give me one more push.
all right?

708
00:47:16.334 --> 00:47:17.903
Listen to me. You gotta
work with us. all right?

709
00:47:17.936 --> 00:47:19.470
We're almost there. Ready?
You're gonna be fine.

710
00:47:19.504 --> 00:47:22.107
- Ready?
- [both] One. two three!

711
00:47:23.341 --> 00:47:25.010
- [both gasping]
- Don't shoot!

712
00:47:25.043 --> 00:47:27.612
It's OK. I'm not gonna shoot.
I'm here to help.

713
00:47:27.645 --> 00:47:29.580
Who's that?
Who's down there?

714
00:47:29.614 --> 00:47:32.083
- [Suzanne] Logan!
- Suzanne. do you need help?

715
00:47:32.117 --> 00:47:34.452
Yeah!

716
00:47:38.156 --> 00:47:40.458
- You OK. Suzanne?
- Yeah. I'm fine. babe.

717
00:48:20.365 --> 00:48:22.433
We need help! Please!

718
00:48:34.245 --> 00:48:37.282
- How many are left inside?
- According to Suzanne.
that's it.

719
00:48:37.315 --> 00:48:39.150
Everybody's accounted for.

720
00:48:39.184 --> 00:48:41.052
Now we just gotta wait
for the SWAT to show up
and get Connor out.

721
00:48:41.086 --> 00:48:43.989
- Who's Connor?
- Connor Dryer.
He's the shooter.

722
00:48:44.022 --> 00:48:45.656
One of Suzanne's
former students.

723
00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:47.125
[Michael] That explains a lot.

724
00:48:47.158 --> 00:48:49.494
- Yeah.
- [cell phone rings]

725
00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:53.531
This is him.

726
00:48:56.501 --> 00:48:57.735
Hello. Connor.

727
00:48:57.768 --> 00:49:00.471
She told you my name.
didn't she?

728
00:49:00.505 --> 00:49:02.140
Yeah. she did.
But it doesn't matter.

729
00:49:02.173 --> 00:49:04.275
Game over.
There's no more hostages.

730
00:49:05.243 --> 00:49:06.411
Oh. really?

731
00:49:06.444 --> 00:49:08.346
Did you hear that. professor?

732
00:49:08.379 --> 00:49:11.082
No more hostages.

733
00:49:11.116 --> 00:49:15.953
What... Connor.
who are you speaking with?

734
00:49:18.689 --> 00:49:20.758
- [gunshot on speaker phone]
- [gasps]

735
00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:22.060
[Michael] Uh... Connor.
what was that?

736
00:49:22.093 --> 00:49:23.728
Is someone
inside with you?

737
00:49:26.331 --> 00:49:28.299
Suzanne?
Are you there?

738
00:49:28.333 --> 00:49:32.237
- It's me. Dr. Egan.
- He has Robert.

739
00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:34.139
The next shot won't miss.

740
00:49:34.172 --> 00:49:39.344
Connor. Connor. what do we have
to do to bring this to an end?

741
00:49:39.377 --> 00:49:43.714
- What do you want?
- I want Suzanne Hollander
in the library in ten minutes.

742
00:49:43.748 --> 00:49:46.351
or Dr. Egan dies.

743
00:49:48.719 --> 00:49:52.157
[machine beeping]

744
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:55.193
[down-tempo rock playing]

745
00:49:55.826 --> 00:49:57.995
[Bonnie] Ms. Hollander?

746
00:49:59.664 --> 00:50:01.432
It's Jeremy. He...

747
00:50:17.515 --> 00:50:20.585
[whispering] I'm so sorry.

748
00:50:20.618 --> 00:50:24.289
* There'll be nothing to fear

749
00:50:25.356 --> 00:50:29.127
* Insecurity is clear

750
00:50:30.228 --> 00:50:34.599
* Want to just disappear

751
00:50:34.632 --> 00:50:38.403
* Disappear from the world

752
00:50:39.404 --> 00:50:42.773
* What a wicked world it is

753
00:50:44.209 --> 00:50:48.746
* Come around. come around

754
00:50:48.779 --> 00:50:52.250
* Come around

755
00:50:52.283 --> 00:50:53.318
I have to go back in.

756
00:50:53.351 --> 00:50:56.687
* Come around. come around

757
00:50:56.721 --> 00:50:57.722
All right.

758
00:50:57.755 --> 00:51:02.127
* Come around

759
00:51:03.794 --> 00:51:07.432
* Impossible

760
00:51:07.465 --> 00:51:10.835
* See we wait for the world

761
00:51:12.403 --> 00:51:16.407
* Is it at all sensible?

762
00:51:16.441 --> 00:51:19.144
* You should be able...

763
00:51:19.177 --> 00:51:20.811
[indistinct chatter]

764
00:51:20.845 --> 00:51:23.714
[sobbing]

765
00:51:29.254 --> 00:51:31.822
[distant siren wailing]

766
00:51:37.362 --> 00:51:41.399
- [Jen] What are they doing?
- They're heading
into the tunnel.

767
00:51:48.939 --> 00:51:50.641
I'm gonna be listening. OK?

768
00:51:50.675 --> 00:51:52.843
- What if he finds the wire?
- No. he won't.

769
00:51:52.877 --> 00:51:54.579
Anything goes wrong.
just say my name and I'm in.

770
00:51:54.612 --> 00:51:56.447
OK. So I'm just
gonna talk to him

771
00:51:56.481 --> 00:51:58.349
- and I'm gonna get him
to let Robert go.
- Yeah.

772
00:51:58.383 --> 00:51:59.750
- OK.
- Anything happens to me...

773
00:51:59.784 --> 00:52:02.720
Nothing can happen to you.
Promise me.

774
00:52:04.522 --> 00:52:06.724
OK. let's go.

775
00:52:11.462 --> 00:52:17.368
[Robert] Connor... she was
very upset when things didn't
work out between you two.

776
00:52:18.436 --> 00:52:20.338
[Connor sighs]

777
00:52:23.941 --> 00:52:25.643
[exhales]

778
00:52:29.847 --> 00:52:32.850
- She told you that?
- Yes. she did.

779
00:52:32.883 --> 00:52:36.254
She wanted to help you.

780
00:52:36.287 --> 00:52:40.691
And. of course. you were
a very big help to her.

781
00:52:40.725 --> 00:52:44.629
I can't remember
another time where she
talked so highly about.

782
00:52:44.662 --> 00:52:48.333
she cared so deeply
about a research subject.

783
00:52:51.336 --> 00:52:54.339
- Then why did she leave me?
- No. no. no...

784
00:52:54.372 --> 00:52:59.810
No. as I recall it. it was you
who made it impossible for
her to continue to see you.

785
00:52:59.844 --> 00:53:03.281
Well. you remember
the coffee shop. Connor.

786
00:53:03.314 --> 00:53:07.918
You tracked her down.
You followed her there. right?

787
00:53:38.316 --> 00:53:39.850
Connor. what
are you doing here?

788
00:53:41.018 --> 00:53:43.454
Why won't you
return my calls?

789
00:53:43.488 --> 00:53:45.656
This is not the time
or the place.

790
00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:47.725
It's a public place.

791
00:53:47.758 --> 00:53:50.361
I'm allowed
to drink coffee.

792
00:53:52.663 --> 00:53:53.998
[whispers] We need to talk.

793
00:53:54.031 --> 00:53:57.702
It is completely
inappropriate that you're here.

794
00:53:57.735 --> 00:54:00.037
Are you writing
something about me?

795
00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:01.906
Of course not.

796
00:54:03.574 --> 00:54:06.043
You want to talk?
Fine. let's talk.

797
00:54:06.076 --> 00:54:08.479
Let's talk about all the
letters you've been sending me.

798
00:54:14.485 --> 00:54:16.454
Yeah. yeah.
let's talk about them.

799
00:54:16.487 --> 00:54:17.988
And the e-mails.
and the phone calls...

800
00:54:18.022 --> 00:54:21.892
- You wouldn't respond to me.
- Because you need to stop.

801
00:54:21.926 --> 00:54:24.795
You told me love
is a choice.

802
00:54:26.597 --> 00:54:29.867
I am not an option.

803
00:54:31.502 --> 00:54:33.003
I can't choose who I love.

804
00:54:33.037 --> 00:54:35.606
You don't love me.

805
00:54:37.107 --> 00:54:40.010
How do you know?

806
00:54:40.044 --> 00:54:41.812
Because it's called
transference...

807
00:54:41.846 --> 00:54:43.314
Just because there's
a fancy word for it

808
00:54:43.348 --> 00:54:45.583
- doesn't make it not real!
- [smacks table]

809
00:54:52.357 --> 00:54:53.924
OK. OK...

810
00:54:53.958 --> 00:54:57.027
Did your boyfriend
find the letters?

811
00:54:59.397 --> 00:55:01.966
He's a big Marine. right?

812
00:55:01.999 --> 00:55:04.469
Does he wanna beat me up?

813
00:55:04.502 --> 00:55:06.971
You need to stop.
Right now.

814
00:55:07.004 --> 00:55:08.706
I can't.

815
00:55:08.739 --> 00:55:12.810
No one's ever paid attention
to me before. cared about me.

816
00:55:14.479 --> 00:55:17.047
Connor. it is my job to care.

817
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:23.521
- So you're a whore.
- What?

818
00:55:23.554 --> 00:55:25.623
You get paid to pretend
like you care.

819
00:55:25.656 --> 00:55:27.725
To feign intimacy.
That makes you a whore.

820
00:55:27.758 --> 00:55:29.927
I do not need
to listen to this.

821
00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:32.730
No. all right. all right.

822
00:55:32.763 --> 00:55:34.999
- I'll stop sending letters.
- Do you promise?

823
00:55:35.032 --> 00:55:36.567
What. are you 12?

824
00:55:36.601 --> 00:55:39.370
You will speak to me
with respect. Connor.

825
00:55:39.404 --> 00:55:41.539
You sound like my mother.

826
00:55:45.175 --> 00:55:48.646
Can you just...?
Connor. please.
Just leave me alone.

827
00:55:48.679 --> 00:55:51.949
You just... you look
so beautiful when
you're this angry.

828
00:55:55.886 --> 00:55:57.555
No!

829
00:55:59.156 --> 00:56:01.025
You see.
whores don't say no.

830
00:56:01.058 --> 00:56:02.727
Don't you...

831
00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:08.132
If you ever come near me again.
I will call the police!

832
00:56:08.165 --> 00:56:11.068
Do you hear me. Connor?
I will call the police!

833
00:56:11.101 --> 00:56:13.438
Leave me alone!

834
00:56:16.474 --> 00:56:18.008
Suzanne!

835
00:56:23.814 --> 00:56:25.716
Why can't you love me?

836
00:56:26.951 --> 00:56:29.587
Because you are
unlovable. Connor.

837
00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:31.989
Just like your mother said.

838
00:56:34.158 --> 00:56:36.026
[door shuts]

839
00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:38.896
[Robert] But she
regretted that. Connor.

840
00:56:38.929 --> 00:56:41.999
She said it... [sighs]

841
00:56:42.032 --> 00:56:43.901
...and she regretted it
the minute she said it.

842
00:56:43.934 --> 00:56:46.937
She said it because she's
human. she made a mistake.

843
00:56:48.873 --> 00:56:52.142
That's what humans do.
they make mistakes.

844
00:56:59.216 --> 00:57:01.986
She told you about that?

845
00:57:02.019 --> 00:57:05.222
- About what she said to me?
- Yeah. she told me
all about it.

846
00:57:05.255 --> 00:57:08.058
But she needed you
to leave her alone.
You were scaring her.

847
00:57:08.092 --> 00:57:10.828
She would've said
anything at that point.

848
00:57:17.101 --> 00:57:18.603
I scared her?

849
00:57:18.636 --> 00:57:21.606
Yeah. But is
that what you want?

850
00:57:21.639 --> 00:57:23.007
I mean. you
want to scare her?

851
00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:25.810
Because I think
you've succeeded at that.

852
00:57:27.945 --> 00:57:29.680
Mm-mm.

853
00:57:32.983 --> 00:57:35.953
[sniffles]
I want her to love me.

854
00:57:39.657 --> 00:57:43.961
Connor... love can't
be won through fear.

855
00:57:53.671 --> 00:57:55.640
[sobs]

856
00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:08.052
You're not reporting me?
I could be fired for this.

857
00:58:08.085 --> 00:58:12.823
Well. you could. but I think
that would be a significant
loss to this institution

858
00:58:12.857 --> 00:58:15.526
and to the scientific community
and I'm not gonna do it.

859
00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:18.195
It's not the first time
that I've lost control. though.

860
00:58:18.228 --> 00:58:22.833
- [sighs]
- It's like a piece
of me that just...

861
00:58:24.001 --> 00:58:25.536
...shuts off.

862
00:58:25.570 --> 00:58:27.237
And I don't know why.

863
00:58:29.239 --> 00:58:33.077
I... I got this.

864
00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:44.889
This is not conclusive.

865
00:58:44.922 --> 00:58:46.256
and you know that.

866
00:58:46.290 --> 00:58:48.559
Right.

867
00:58:48.593 --> 00:58:52.162
So I want you to give me
the Psychopathy Test. also.

868
00:58:54.932 --> 00:58:56.200
I just have to know.

869
00:58:56.233 --> 00:58:58.268
Suzanne. look...

870
00:58:58.302 --> 00:59:03.107
This is the kind of psychosis
that makes the world go round.

871
00:59:03.140 --> 00:59:06.811
OK? There is a
huge preponderance of
psychopathic personalities

872
00:59:06.844 --> 00:59:11.315
in the political
and the business
elite of this country!

873
00:59:11.348 --> 00:59:14.218
I mean. how do you
think they get things done?

874
00:59:14.251 --> 00:59:16.053
Lack of empathy.

875
00:59:17.254 --> 00:59:19.657
That doesn't make
me feel any better.

876
00:59:19.690 --> 00:59:23.260
I... Will you please
just run the test?

877
00:59:27.698 --> 00:59:29.133
Of course.

878
00:59:37.875 --> 00:59:39.276
[gun cocks]

879
00:59:59.129 --> 01:00:00.831
Connor?

880
01:00:02.166 --> 01:00:03.934
You armed?

881
01:00:05.135 --> 01:00:06.804
No.

882
01:00:09.173 --> 01:00:10.875
Can I check?

883
01:00:14.111 --> 01:00:15.713
Yes.

884
01:00:52.717 --> 01:00:54.885
[breath shuddering]

885
01:01:08.232 --> 01:01:10.968
[voice trembling]
I missed you. Suzanne.

886
01:01:11.001 --> 01:01:14.071
It's... it's good
to see you again.

887
01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.843
Can he go? [clears throat]

888
01:01:18.876 --> 01:01:20.778
Yeah. sure.

889
01:01:31.889 --> 01:01:33.423
[cutting tape]

890
01:01:35.459 --> 01:01:37.694
See ya later. doc.

891
01:01:43.267 --> 01:01:47.838
Connor. Remember
what we talked about.

892
01:01:50.174 --> 01:01:52.309
Go. please.

893
01:01:58.215 --> 01:02:00.184
So I'm here.
[clears throat]

894
01:02:00.217 --> 01:02:02.486
- What did you want to talk...
- You told me love
is a choice. right?

895
01:02:02.519 --> 01:02:08.092
I mean. 'cause if you could.
you probably wouldn't have
loved your father. right?

896
01:02:09.794 --> 01:02:13.764
- What?
- It would have made
it easier for you...

897
01:02:13.798 --> 01:02:15.966
...when your
mother killed him.

898
01:02:17.868 --> 01:02:21.471
What... what are
you talking about?

899
01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:24.842
And then you found Dr. Egan.

900
01:02:28.545 --> 01:02:30.915
He became like a
father to you. right?

901
01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:34.384
Connor...

902
01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:39.023
And I couldn't imagine
losing a father twice.

903
01:02:39.056 --> 01:02:41.525
[Suzanne whimpering]
Connor...

904
01:02:41.558 --> 01:02:44.261
- Please. don't...
- You don't love me.

905
01:02:46.030 --> 01:02:47.932
But if you won't love me...

906
01:02:47.965 --> 01:02:52.903
[Suzanne sobbing] Connor...

907
01:02:52.937 --> 01:02:54.939
...then you'll fear me.

908
01:02:59.243 --> 01:03:00.978
Connor!

909
01:03:07.117 --> 01:03:09.153
[Robert] Tell me more
about your mother.

910
01:03:09.186 --> 01:03:12.322
Uh. more about
that night. or...?

911
01:03:12.356 --> 01:03:15.159
Just whatever you
remember about her.

912
01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.428
Mm...

913
01:03:18.462 --> 01:03:21.198
She was very smart.

914
01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:24.001
Meticulous.

915
01:03:24.034 --> 01:03:27.271
She used to read the paper
from cover to cover every day.

916
01:03:27.304 --> 01:03:33.277
- And your dad?
- He read it. too.
He just. um...

917
01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:37.982
He thought that the paper
was something to be shared.

918
01:03:38.015 --> 01:03:40.084
You know.
like a family affair.

919
01:03:40.117 --> 01:03:44.321
Everyone takes a section.
reads it. reports back.

920
01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:49.093
My mom didn't
think like that.

921
01:03:49.126 --> 01:03:53.297
She'd get so irritated
when he'd bring it up.
you know. like.

922
01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:56.466
"Why do you have to talk
about every thought that
comes into your head?"

923
01:03:56.500 --> 01:04:01.171
So... that's usually
how it started.

924
01:04:01.205 --> 01:04:04.108
How... how what
usually started?

925
01:04:05.009 --> 01:04:06.476
The fighting.

926
01:04:07.644 --> 01:04:11.081
- [shouting]
- [yelling]

927
01:04:12.416 --> 01:04:13.450
Suzanne. stop.

928
01:04:13.483 --> 01:04:14.919
Let him go.

929
01:04:18.989 --> 01:04:20.490
[Suzanne gasping]

930
01:04:20.524 --> 01:04:23.928
- Get up.
- [Suzanne yells]

931
01:04:25.029 --> 01:04:29.466
See. we are just alike.
you and me.

932
01:04:29.499 --> 01:04:32.269
And you're gonna have
your chance to prove it.

933
01:04:32.302 --> 01:04:35.439
Just. we're not there yet.

934
01:04:35.472 --> 01:04:37.474
And you must be
the fiance. right?

935
01:04:38.575 --> 01:04:41.578
Logan?
You're pretty good.

936
01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:43.113
Don't hurt her. OK?

937
01:04:43.147 --> 01:04:44.581
I won't. As long as you
do exactly as I say.

938
01:04:44.614 --> 01:04:46.283
Put the gun down.

939
01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:50.620
OK. so how do you
read the paper?

940
01:04:51.355 --> 01:04:53.390
Alone. I guess.

941
01:04:53.423 --> 01:04:56.593
So you don't read the paper like
your mother did. cover to cover?

942
01:04:56.626 --> 01:05:02.266
And when you read the paper.
what kind of stories
are you gravitated toward?

943
01:05:03.167 --> 01:05:05.235
Is that relevant?

944
01:05:09.073 --> 01:05:11.942
Um...

945
01:05:11.976 --> 01:05:16.213
I guess I gravitate
towards stories of my...

946
01:05:17.581 --> 01:05:21.952
...um. my... my area of study.

947
01:05:21.986 --> 01:05:26.190
OK. What about the
science attracts you?

948
01:05:26.223 --> 01:05:29.226
What kind of details
are you looking for?
What catches your eye?

949
01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:31.628
I mean. I don't
think I look for myself

950
01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:36.500
or that I look for things
that relate to my
specific research.

951
01:05:36.533 --> 01:05:39.303
but. you know. if there's
a quote. I might read it.

952
01:05:39.336 --> 01:05:41.471
but I don't think that I would
search it out. you know.

953
01:05:41.505 --> 01:05:46.510
and really try to find
things about myself.

954
01:05:46.543 --> 01:05:49.713
[Connor] It better be tight.
I'm gonna check.

955
01:05:57.354 --> 01:06:00.991
"While the psychopath cannot
feel true empathy or love.

956
01:06:01.025 --> 01:06:05.095
his inflated sense of self
worth makes him believe
that he loves any individual

957
01:06:05.129 --> 01:06:08.765
who gives him the
attention he feels he deserves.

958
01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:13.003
This is especially true
for those who were abused
or neglected as children.

959
01:06:13.037 --> 01:06:17.441
Take. for example.
the case of Connor..."

960
01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:20.610
- [cocks gun]
- What's he talking
about. Suzanne?

961
01:06:20.644 --> 01:06:23.213
He's quoting my thesis paper.
I don't know how he got it.

962
01:06:23.247 --> 01:06:27.051
[Connor] "Connor scored a 37
on the Psychopathy Test.

963
01:06:27.084 --> 01:06:30.154
a score indicating the
inability to feel empathy.

964
01:06:30.187 --> 01:06:33.357
a necessary
precondition for love.

965
01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:38.028
His brain scan showed
a complete lack of activity

966
01:06:38.062 --> 01:06:40.297
in his orbitofrontal cortex.

967
01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:43.333
And yet Connor claimed
to be in love with me.

968
01:06:43.367 --> 01:06:48.605
Thus. he translated
the indulgence of his
narcissism as love?"

969
01:06:48.638 --> 01:06:52.142
- Are you kidding me?
- Connor. it's true.

970
01:06:52.176 --> 01:06:56.180
What you feel for me
is not love.

971
01:06:57.614 --> 01:06:59.516
You used me!

972
01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:04.654
You never cared about me.
You said you did.

973
01:07:04.688 --> 01:07:07.057
but you had made up
your mind about me

974
01:07:07.091 --> 01:07:08.758
from the moment you met me.
just like everyone else.

975
01:07:08.792 --> 01:07:12.129
You know that's not true!
Of course I cared about you!

976
01:07:12.162 --> 01:07:14.431
It was my job to try
and figure you out

977
01:07:14.464 --> 01:07:18.034
- so I could help you!
- Why didn't you just look
inside your own head?

978
01:07:19.203 --> 01:07:21.638
You're just as
screwed up as I am.

979
01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:29.213
Let's talk more
about your parents.

980
01:07:29.246 --> 01:07:32.116
You said they...
they fought.

981
01:07:33.383 --> 01:07:37.187
You know. I think
about that night a lot.

982
01:07:38.522 --> 01:07:42.359
I dream about it. what happened.

983
01:07:42.392 --> 01:07:47.297
But in my dreams. it's not
my mom shooting my father.

984
01:07:48.732 --> 01:07:50.800
I'm shooting my father.

985
01:08:00.577 --> 01:08:03.713
What's wrong? You don't
want your boyfriend to find out

986
01:08:03.747 --> 01:08:07.451
that you have the
same biological make
up as Charles Manson?

987
01:08:17.794 --> 01:08:19.529
You see that?

988
01:08:21.298 --> 01:08:24.768
That is Suzanne's orbitofrontal
cortex. right there.

989
01:08:24.801 --> 01:08:27.137
See that void?

990
01:08:31.441 --> 01:08:33.210
You see that one?

991
01:08:33.243 --> 01:08:35.679
Hey. look at me. Look at me.

992
01:08:35.712 --> 01:08:37.247
I'm talking to you!
Do you see it?

993
01:08:37.281 --> 01:08:40.184
- [Suzanne] Connor. stop.
- Same void.

994
01:08:44.588 --> 01:08:47.691
What do you think about
your girlfriend now?

995
01:08:47.724 --> 01:08:51.528
- What does it mean. Suzanne?
- She didn't want to tell you.

996
01:08:51.561 --> 01:08:53.463
'cause she knew
you'd leave her.

997
01:08:53.497 --> 01:08:56.466
That you wouldn't
love her anymore.

998
01:08:57.834 --> 01:09:00.470
Well. I don't care.

999
01:09:01.905 --> 01:09:03.773
What do you mean
you don't care?

1000
01:09:06.743 --> 01:09:11.315
- [Logan] Doesn't matter.
- You're not worried...

1001
01:09:13.783 --> 01:09:17.621
...she might go all psycho
one day and kill you
in front of your kids?

1002
01:09:17.654 --> 01:09:20.524
- Huh? Hey. hey. hey!
- Connor. stop it!

1003
01:09:21.858 --> 01:09:23.893
Just like her mother did?

1004
01:09:39.376 --> 01:09:40.677
Why?

1005
01:09:43.513 --> 01:09:45.549
Because I love her.

1006
01:09:48.852 --> 01:09:51.888
And some brain scan's
not gonna change that.

1007
01:09:53.623 --> 01:09:55.692
You can't love her.

1008
01:09:57.861 --> 01:10:00.264
I love her.

1009
01:10:00.964 --> 01:10:03.267
She's mine.

1010
01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:05.835
- Connor. no!
- Aah!

1011
01:10:05.869 --> 01:10:08.538
- That's it. That's it.
- What are you doing?

1012
01:10:08.572 --> 01:10:10.774
- You can't go in there.
- Somebody just got shot.

1013
01:10:10.807 --> 01:10:12.742
- Can't you wait?
- I gotta go in.

1014
01:10:12.776 --> 01:10:14.611
Please. the SWAT team
will be here any minute.

1015
01:10:14.644 --> 01:10:16.913
Forget it. Jen.
Forget it. OK?

1016
01:10:16.946 --> 01:10:21.618
When the SWAT team gets here.
if they get here...

1017
01:10:21.651 --> 01:10:22.886
...tell them what to do.

1018
01:10:26.623 --> 01:10:30.960
Jen... it's OK.

1019
01:10:30.994 --> 01:10:32.762
That punk has taken our town

1020
01:10:32.796 --> 01:10:33.897
and flipping it upside down.

1021
01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:35.899
I'm not gonna put
up with it anymore.

1022
01:10:35.932 --> 01:10:39.636
If he comes out of that
building before I do.
you take him out yourself.

1023
01:10:44.408 --> 01:10:47.377
- Connor. put the gun down!
- You shouldn't have done that.

1024
01:10:47.411 --> 01:10:49.413
Don't tell me
what I shouldn't do.
Just put the gun down!

1025
01:10:49.446 --> 01:10:51.615
You keep sounding
like my mother.

1026
01:10:51.648 --> 01:10:53.683
Do you want me to play that
role? 'Cause I can do that.

1027
01:10:53.717 --> 01:10:56.886
- I can do that. Stop it!
- No.

1028
01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:58.622
Connor. this is
about you and me.

1029
01:10:58.655 --> 01:11:00.757
This has nothing to do with him.
Just put it down.

1030
01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:02.058
No! And you can't make me!

1031
01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:05.562
Listen to me!
Put the gun down!

1032
01:11:05.595 --> 01:11:08.332
[Michael] Connor. freeze!

1033
01:11:08.365 --> 01:11:10.867
- Stay right there.
- It's me. it's
Lieutenant Olsen.

1034
01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:13.670
- I've been talking on
the phone to you. pal.
- [Suzanne yells]

1035
01:11:14.904 --> 01:11:17.374
[Logan] Connor!

1036
01:11:17.407 --> 01:11:20.076
I told you if I saw any cops.
I'd start killing hostages.

1037
01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:22.746
Listen. listen. Connor.
The SWAT team is on the way.

1038
01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:24.481
Trust me. you want to talk
to me and not them.

1039
01:11:24.514 --> 01:11:26.850
Pick up my bag.

1040
01:11:26.883 --> 01:11:28.852
I told you. if I saw cops...

1041
01:11:28.885 --> 01:11:30.954
- Connor. drop it!
- Shut up.

1042
01:11:31.688 --> 01:11:32.922
[gasping]

1043
01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:35.759
- [Michael] Connor...
- Whatever.

1044
01:11:35.792 --> 01:11:37.494
- Come on!
- [screams]

1045
01:11:38.061 --> 01:11:40.296
[frustrated grunt]

1046
01:11:41.898 --> 01:11:43.667
Jen. get a medic
in here right away.

1047
01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:45.635
- You got hit anywhere else?
- No. it's just the leg.

1048
01:12:09.693 --> 01:12:12.829
[sirens wailing]

1049
01:12:23.139 --> 01:12:26.876
Hey. the SWAT team is here.
Do you know where they went?

1050
01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:30.647
I don't know.
but Olsen followed them.

1051
01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:33.550
- Which way?
- Down the hall to the right.

1052
01:12:36.986 --> 01:12:38.522
SWAT command. do you read?

1053
01:12:38.555 --> 01:12:40.056
[man on radio]
SWAT command. over.

1054
01:12:40.089 --> 01:12:41.425
We shouldn't send
them in yet.

1055
01:12:41.458 --> 01:12:42.859
Look. we appreciate
all your help.

1056
01:12:42.892 --> 01:12:44.828
but I'm going to turn
this over to SWAT.

1057
01:12:44.861 --> 01:12:47.631
[man] Sergeant?
We read. over.

1058
01:12:47.664 --> 01:12:51.100
You've never dealt with anything
on this scale before. have you?

1059
01:12:51.134 --> 01:12:53.169
- No.
- OK. listen...

1060
01:12:53.202 --> 01:12:56.440
We got a shooter in there
who's holding my fiance
by gunpoint.

1061
01:12:56.473 --> 01:13:00.009
You send in SWAT.
he's gonna kill her.

1062
01:13:00.043 --> 01:13:02.378
Do you trust your
Lieutenant Olsen?

1063
01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:05.148
More than
anything in the world.

1064
01:13:05.181 --> 01:13:09.819
OK. OK. well. let's let him try
to defuse the situation. OK?

1065
01:13:11.054 --> 01:13:12.822
All right?

1066
01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:19.062
SWAT commander. stand down.
I repeat. stand down.

1067
01:13:19.095 --> 01:13:21.898
We still have an active
hostage situation.

1068
01:13:24.901 --> 01:13:28.605
Take a seat.
Just like old times.

1069
01:13:35.579 --> 01:13:37.447
So let's talk.

1070
01:13:37.481 --> 01:13:41.017
I'm not really
in the mood for this. Connor.

1071
01:13:41.951 --> 01:13:43.687
What do you want?

1072
01:13:45.522 --> 01:13:47.457
I want to feel comfortable.

1073
01:13:47.491 --> 01:13:49.926
And this is the only place
I've ever felt comfortable.

1074
01:13:49.959 --> 01:13:52.061
but you took that
away from me.

1075
01:13:53.563 --> 01:13:56.099
- You made that choice.
- No. I didn't!

1076
01:13:56.132 --> 01:13:57.801
You threw me out!

1077
01:13:57.834 --> 01:14:02.806
We're gonna have
a session. Right now!

1078
01:14:08.077 --> 01:14:11.447
[sniffs] Fine.

1079
01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:25.895
So. what do you want to ask me?

1080
01:14:25.929 --> 01:14:30.266
How did you. uh...
read my thesis?

1081
01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:31.868
Dr. Egan's the only one
who's ever seen it.

1082
01:14:31.901 --> 01:14:33.970
Please.
That was child's play.

1083
01:14:34.003 --> 01:14:37.206
You should really think
of a better password
for your laptop.

1084
01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:40.810
You broke into my office
and went through my things?

1085
01:14:40.844 --> 01:14:44.681
[Connor] You've got
quite the stash in there.

1086
01:14:44.714 --> 01:14:47.651
Fascinating newspaper
clippings. What was it. um...

1087
01:14:47.684 --> 01:14:49.719
"Mother Kills Father
in Front of Daughter."

1088
01:14:49.753 --> 01:14:53.857
And then there was. "Suburban
Mother Goes Murderous."

1089
01:14:53.890 --> 01:14:58.194
My personal favorite was
"The Bloodsoaked Baby."

1090
01:14:58.227 --> 01:15:00.096
[Suzanne] Stop it.

1091
01:15:03.066 --> 01:15:05.702
I can't
take this anymore.

1092
01:15:05.735 --> 01:15:09.005
If you're gonna kill me.
Connor. just do it!

1093
01:15:10.907 --> 01:15:13.009
All the fun would be over.

1094
01:15:15.011 --> 01:15:17.881
Oh. I almost forgot.

1095
01:15:19.749 --> 01:15:22.118
I have something of yours.

1096
01:15:26.590 --> 01:15:29.893
I guess. um. Dr. Egan
gave you that test

1097
01:15:29.926 --> 01:15:32.596
to see if you really
are a psychopath?

1098
01:15:33.997 --> 01:15:35.799
Wanna see the results?

1099
01:15:42.305 --> 01:15:45.141
Yep. Right here.

1100
01:15:45.174 --> 01:15:47.276
Certifiable.

1101
01:15:48.144 --> 01:15:50.980
Just like me.

1102
01:15:51.014 --> 01:15:53.717
- You're lying.
- Why would I lie?

1103
01:15:55.719 --> 01:15:57.053
Huh? Why?

1104
01:15:58.955 --> 01:16:00.657
No. look right here.

1105
01:16:00.690 --> 01:16:03.292
"Childhood behavior
difficulties." you got a two.

1106
01:16:03.326 --> 01:16:04.894
That's the same thing I got.

1107
01:16:04.928 --> 01:16:08.264
Um. "Shallow emotional
responsiveness."

1108
01:16:08.297 --> 01:16:10.033
You a one.
I got a two on that one.

1109
01:16:10.066 --> 01:16:12.168
- Please. just stop.
- Hitting too close to home?

1110
01:16:12.201 --> 01:16:16.840
- I am nothing like you.
- Oh. I think you are.

1111
01:16:16.873 --> 01:16:19.275
I think you would have
killed me back there if
I hadn't drawn my knife.

1112
01:16:19.308 --> 01:16:23.079
- I saw it in your eyes.
- Yeah. and you would have
liked that. right?

1113
01:16:24.848 --> 01:16:26.916
I want to know.
how does it feel.

1114
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:29.152
to know that it's because
of you that all these people
are dead?

1115
01:16:29.185 --> 01:16:31.254
Oh. I will not own that. Connor!

1116
01:16:31.287 --> 01:16:33.657
- You did this!
- [chuckles] That's...

1117
01:16:33.690 --> 01:16:35.692
That's what I thought you'd say.

1118
01:16:35.725 --> 01:16:40.630
Right here. number three:
"Little or no compassion
or guilt."

1119
01:16:40.664 --> 01:16:42.932
If you're gonna kill me.
just pull the trigger!

1120
01:16:44.167 --> 01:16:45.769
Is that what you want?

1121
01:16:45.802 --> 01:16:47.904
Pull the trigger!

1122
01:16:47.937 --> 01:16:49.706
You want me to?
Because I will!

1123
01:16:49.739 --> 01:16:53.710
No. you won't. because that
was never part of your plan!

1124
01:16:55.078 --> 01:16:57.180
You were never gonna kill me.

1125
01:17:01.317 --> 01:17:03.152
I knew you'd understand.

1126
01:17:07.190 --> 01:17:09.058
Yeah.

1127
01:17:13.963 --> 01:17:16.332
Because if I kill you.

1128
01:17:16.365 --> 01:17:19.135
then I'm just as crazy
as you are. right?

1129
01:17:20.737 --> 01:17:22.638
That's been your plan.

1130
01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:26.242
It would be
better than suicide.

1131
01:17:26.275 --> 01:17:29.813
Come on.
Suzanne. do it.

1132
01:17:29.846 --> 01:17:33.082
I know you want to.
And no one will know.

1133
01:17:33.116 --> 01:17:35.251
It'll be between
you and I.

1134
01:17:35.284 --> 01:17:37.987
You could say
it was self defense.

1135
01:17:38.888 --> 01:17:41.657
Come on. End it.

1136
01:17:42.291 --> 01:17:44.060
Get on your knees.

1137
01:17:44.093 --> 01:17:46.696
Get on your knees!

1138
01:17:50.199 --> 01:17:53.737
[breathing deeply]

1139
01:17:55.438 --> 01:17:57.707
I just wanted you
to take the pain away.

1140
01:17:57.741 --> 01:17:59.175
I know.

1141
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:15.424
I love you. Suzanne.

1142
01:18:15.458 --> 01:18:17.293
[gun fires]

1143
01:18:23.399 --> 01:18:25.368
You don't deserve to die.

* Can I walk

* Walk beside you

1151

* The day when all the fears
come true *

1153
01:19:43.412 --> 01:19:45.882
Hey. Alice.
You know the rules.

1154
01:19:45.915 --> 01:19:47.583
No passing any personal items.

1155
01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:49.318
[lock beeps]

1156
01:19:49.352 --> 01:19:51.354
And keep your hands
where I can see them.

1157
01:19:51.387 --> 01:19:54.423
[buzzer rings]

1158
01:19:54.457 --> 01:19:57.460
- [Suzanne] Mom.
- [door clangs shut]

1159
01:19:57.493 --> 01:20:00.229
[Alice] If you say so.

1160
01:20:00.263 --> 01:20:02.131
It's Suzanne.

1161
01:20:03.232 --> 01:20:06.135
I wrote you off
a long time ago.

1162
01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:11.240
I'm sure you did.

1163
01:20:11.274 --> 01:20:14.978
To tell you the truth. I've
spent my entire life trying
to write you off as well.

1164
01:20:15.011 --> 01:20:18.514
but... I just can't.

1165
01:20:18.547 --> 01:20:22.051
Well. you should.
What do I care?

1166
01:20:22.085 --> 01:20:24.487
You shouldn't.

1167
01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:27.223
I've been a horrible daughter.

1168
01:20:29.425 --> 01:20:32.828
I haven't come to visit
you once in 25 years.
and you're my mother.

1169
01:20:33.963 --> 01:20:36.866
Hell of a mother I've been.

1170
01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:41.404
You have been an
enormous part of my life.

1171
01:20:41.437 --> 01:20:43.206
More than you will ever know.

1172
01:20:45.041 --> 01:20:46.910
I'm sorry.

1173
01:20:47.643 --> 01:20:51.214
Don't be.
It's who I am.

1174
01:20:54.017 --> 01:20:55.919
It's actually why
I'm here today.

1175
01:20:55.952 --> 01:20:59.956
I. um.... I wanted
to open this in front of you.

1176
01:21:01.157 --> 01:21:05.128
It's my Psychopathy
Test results.

1177
01:21:05.161 --> 01:21:07.296
It's going to tell me
whether or not I'm like you.

1178
01:21:07.330 --> 01:21:10.967
You need a test
to tell you that?

1179
01:21:12.501 --> 01:21:16.940
I've spent my
entire life terrified

1180
01:21:16.973 --> 01:21:21.177
that I am some
ticking time bomb.

1181
01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:24.080
because I am your daughter.

1182
01:21:25.949 --> 01:21:30.053
Not a big believer
in free will. huh?

1183
01:21:30.086 --> 01:21:35.491
You think I couldn't
control what I did?

1184
01:21:35.524 --> 01:21:41.530
[scoffs] Now you're gonna
try to make me feel guilty
for your miserable life?

1185
01:21:42.298 --> 01:21:43.632
That's rich.

1186
01:21:43.666 --> 01:21:45.634
[chuckles] Look at me.

1187
01:21:46.602 --> 01:21:48.671
Ask me if I care.

1188
01:22:13.129 --> 01:22:15.464
I'm gonna be OK.

1189
01:22:16.665 --> 01:22:19.535
Big surprise.

1190
01:22:31.114 --> 01:22:32.515
Maybe I'll see you next week.

1191
01:22:32.548 --> 01:22:34.283
No. don't bother.

1192
01:22:37.386 --> 01:22:40.023
I will see you next week. Mom.

1193
01:23:29.072 --> 01:23:31.574
[panting]

1194
01:23:35.478 --> 01:23:37.746
[laughing]

1195
01:23:48.424 --> 01:23:51.160
[cheering]

1196
01:23:51.194 --> 01:23:53.496
- Oh. this is horrible.
- Oh. my God.

1197
01:23:53.529 --> 01:23:56.432
This is so bad.

1198
01:23:56.465 --> 01:23:59.368
- It's horrible.
- How's your leg?

1199
01:24:01.237 --> 01:24:02.738
It's pretty good.

1200
01:24:02.771 --> 01:24:05.674
Gives me an excuse
for losing. so that's good.

1201
01:24:05.708 --> 01:24:09.645
[laughing] You are such
a bad loser.

1202
01:24:16.585 --> 01:24:19.122
Oh. Hey.

1203
01:24:20.589 --> 01:24:22.291
[clears throat]

1204
01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:26.595
Ask me.

1205
01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:29.732
It's... it's a standing offer.
you know that.

1206
01:24:29.765 --> 01:24:31.767
Just ask me.

1207
01:24:36.705 --> 01:24:39.442
Be careful. don't...
[laughing] don't hurt your leg!

1208
01:24:40.276 --> 01:24:41.777
It's OK.

1209
01:24:43.646 --> 01:24:45.681
Suzanne...

1210
01:24:47.883 --> 01:24:50.286
...will you marry me?

1211
01:24:51.487 --> 01:24:53.756
Yes.

1212
01:25:09.572 --> 01:25:12.641
[rock music playing]

1213
01:25:22.385 --> 01:25:24.853
* Who are you and
what have you done? *

1214
01:25:24.887 --> 01:25:28.257
* I don't see the pressure
behind the one *

1215
01:25:28.291 --> 01:25:31.694
* Who's taking over
and has begun *

1216
01:25:31.727 --> 01:25:35.298
* To open up my heart

1217
01:25:35.331 --> 01:25:37.933
* Seen you lately
walkin' about *

1218
01:25:37.966 --> 01:25:41.570
* I've been trying to figure
this whole thing out *

1219
01:25:41.604 --> 01:25:44.373
* How did you get
into my heart *

1220
01:25:44.407 --> 01:25:48.244
* And where did
this all start? *

1221
01:25:48.277 --> 01:25:51.380
* I don't know how
to resolve this *

1222
01:25:51.414 --> 01:25:54.783
* I have no idea
about the memory of this *

1223
01:25:54.817 --> 01:25:57.586
* How did you find out
all about this *

1224
01:25:57.620 --> 01:26:02.525
* Is there something
I missed? *

1225
01:26:02.558 --> 01:26:07.763
* Oh. where are you

1226
01:26:07.796 --> 01:26:09.398
* Hiding now?

1227
01:26:09.432 --> 01:26:13.902
* There in the distance

1228
01:26:13.936 --> 01:26:15.704
* Staring at me

1229
01:26:15.738 --> 01:26:19.808
* While you find a place

1230
01:26:19.842 --> 01:26:22.478
* To cast away

1231
01:26:22.511 --> 01:26:24.447
* Your spell on me

1232
01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:25.814
* Spell on me

1233
01:26:25.848 --> 01:26:32.555
* Spell on me. me. me. me

1234
01:26:32.588 --> 01:26:35.291
* There's no place
safe from you *

1235
01:26:35.324 --> 01:26:37.960
* You come right
out of the blue *

1236
01:26:37.993 --> 01:26:41.430
* And there is no
hiding place *

1237
01:26:41.464 --> 01:26:44.900
* That could keep me away

1238
01:26:44.933 --> 01:26:47.936
* There's danger
lurking around *

1239
01:26:47.970 --> 01:26:49.572
* I try to stay cautious

1240
01:26:49.605 --> 01:26:51.274
* But there isn't a sound

1241
01:26:51.307 --> 01:26:54.577
* And the sounds
I tend to hear *

1242
01:26:54.610 --> 01:26:58.013
* Are only in my mind

1243
01:26:58.046 --> 01:27:00.716
* It's hard to forget
about it *

1244
01:27:00.749 --> 01:27:02.785
* When I'm sitting
in front of you *

1245
01:27:02.818 --> 01:27:04.687
* Shouting at it

1246
01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:07.623
* The spider web forming

1247
01:27:07.656 --> 01:27:11.794
* This heavenly net

1248
01:27:11.827 --> 01:27:17.433
* Oh. where are you

1249
01:27:17.466 --> 01:27:19.034
* Hiding now?

1250
01:27:19.067 --> 01:27:23.639
* There in the distance

1251
01:27:23.672 --> 01:27:25.641
* Staring at me

1252
01:27:25.674 --> 01:27:29.878
* While you find a place

1253
01:27:29.912 --> 01:27:32.548
* To cast away

1254
01:27:32.581 --> 01:27:33.982
* Your spell on me

1255
01:27:34.016 --> 01:27:35.818
* Spell on me

1256
01:27:35.851 --> 01:27:41.290
* Spell on me. me. me. me
