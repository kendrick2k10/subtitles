<i>They were monochorionic.</i>

4
00:00:22.979 --> 00:00:24.937
<i>monoamniotic twins.</i>

5
00:00:25.895 --> 00:00:27.375
<i>The rarest kind.</i>

6
00:00:28.506 --> 00:00:31.814
<i>only occurring in one percent
of all twin pregnancies.</i>

7
00:00:32.684 --> 00:00:35.035
<i>They shared
the same amniotic sac.</i>

8
00:00:35.948 --> 00:00:37.298
<i>the same placenta.</i>

9
00:00:37.602 --> 00:00:39.735
<i>The only way
they could have been closer</i>

10
00:00:39.822 --> 00:00:41.258
<i>is if they were conjoined.</i>

11
00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:44.653
<i>They were quite premature.</i>

12
00:00:44.827 --> 00:00:46.872
<i>They had to spend time
in the NICU.</i>

13
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.788
<i>Whenever little Anna
was taken away</i>

14
00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:52.139
<i>for feeding or care...</i>

15
00:00:53.575 --> 00:00:55.751
<i>...Zoe would
just cry her lungs out.</i>

16
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.014
<i>Science can't explain that.</i>

17
00:00:58.101 --> 00:00:59.450
<i>That's what
David always said.</i>

18
00:01:00.234 --> 00:01:03.019
<i>My babies
weren't even 24 hours old</i>

19
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.412
<i>when I realized that...</i>

20
00:01:06.153 --> 00:01:07.632
they would never need me

21
00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:10.200
as much as other babies
need their mothers.

22
00:01:13.334 --> 00:01:15.379
See. a... a mother should be

23
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.165
the most important person
in the world

24
00:01:19.035 --> 00:01:20.036
to a baby.

25
00:01:20.993 --> 00:01:21.907
but...

26
00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.085
I wasn't.

27
00:01:27.391 --> 00:01:30.133
They always needed each other
more than they needed me.

28
00:01:31.047 --> 00:01:32.483
more than anything.

29
00:02:50.387 --> 00:02:51.432
Jesus. Anna.

30
00:02:52.215 --> 00:02:53.434
You can't say this shit.

31
00:02:53.521 --> 00:02:54.478
No fucking way.

32
00:02:54.565 --> 00:02:55.566
Say what?

33
00:02:56.393 --> 00:02:58.743
"My friends say I'm fun.
romantic. and honest"?

34
00:02:59.266 --> 00:03:00.745
Can't say
"horny and ambitious."

35
00:03:00.832 --> 00:03:01.920
that'd be your profile.

36
00:03:02.225 --> 00:03:04.184
If I was desperate enough
to do this shit. then yeah.

37
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:05.185
maybe that's what it would say.

38
00:03:05.446 --> 00:03:06.969
Oh. come on. Zoe.

39
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.365
What's wrong
with "fun and romantic"?

40
00:03:11.495 --> 00:03:12.496
Well. it's boring as fuck.

41
00:03:12.583 --> 00:03:13.802
The real problem

42
00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:15.195
is that "my friends say"
bullshit.

43
00:03:15.804 --> 00:03:16.761
it's weak.

44
00:03:17.066 --> 00:03:18.894
You should know yourself
better than anyone.

45
00:03:22.071 --> 00:03:23.681
And you should say you're 29.

46
00:03:24.508 --> 00:03:25.466
I'm 31.

47
00:03:26.031 --> 00:03:27.250
We're 31.

48
00:03:27.642 --> 00:03:28.817
Men like younger women. Anna.

49
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.949
I don't like lying. Zoe.

50
00:03:31.907 --> 00:03:34.344
Will two years really make
that big of a difference?

51
00:03:34.518 --> 00:03:36.172
When you're on
the wrong side of 30.

52
00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:37.304
emphatic "yes."

53
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.048
Why are you wearing that?

54
00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:44.659
You always
make fun of my clothes.

55
00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:45.964
I have an audition tomorrow

56
00:03:46.051 --> 00:03:47.575
and I need to look
sort of dull.

57
00:03:51.274 --> 00:03:53.189
You really think
I should lie about my age?

58
00:03:53.276 --> 00:03:54.886
You wanna be completely honest?

59
00:03:54.973 --> 00:03:56.410
As a matter of fact. I do.

60
00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.889
Well. then I guess
you better 'fess up

61
00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.282
that you're on the hunt
for a husband.

62
00:03:59.804 --> 00:04:02.372
Obviously. I wouldn't say that.
It would just scare guys away.

63
00:04:03.112 --> 00:04:05.419
Exactly. Hence. lying.

64
00:04:06.333 --> 00:04:07.856
the foundation
of every relationship.

65
00:04:14.776 --> 00:04:17.257
Maybe we could make
a profile for you too.

66
00:04:17.953 --> 00:04:18.954
just for fun.

67
00:04:19.041 --> 00:04:21.043
Or maybe
I could blow my brains out.

68
00:04:22.523 --> 00:04:24.046
Zoe. don't say that.

69
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:27.876
Don't you ever get lonely?

70
00:04:28.398 --> 00:04:29.269
Why would I?

71
00:04:30.095 --> 00:04:30.966
I have you.

72
00:04:33.055 --> 00:04:34.012
Always.

73
00:04:37.407 --> 00:04:39.844
So. your first foray
into dating sites.

74
00:04:39.975 --> 00:04:42.064
How are you finding it? Not so great.

75
00:04:42.151 --> 00:04:43.370
- No?
-No.

76
00:04:44.588 --> 00:04:45.459
This one guy

77
00:04:45.763 --> 00:04:47.069
wanted to bring his mother
on our first date.

78
00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:48.113
Oh!

79
00:04:48.418 --> 00:04:50.812
And this other guy wanted me
to brush my hair

80
00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:52.117
with the brush
that belonged to his mother.

81
00:04:52.204 --> 00:04:54.206
- What?
- She was dead.

82
00:04:54.337 --> 00:04:56.818
I'm so sorry! What--
What are these guys after?

83
00:04:56.905 --> 00:04:58.515
Looking to turn you
into their mothers?

84
00:04:58.602 --> 00:05:01.170
Yeah. mother or minx.

85
00:05:02.432 --> 00:05:03.825
Which one are you looking for?

86
00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:05.479
Uh...

87
00:05:05.696 --> 00:05:08.960
...well.
I absolutely adore my mom.

88
00:05:09.134 --> 00:05:10.092
but. uh...

89
00:05:11.049 --> 00:05:12.224
no. not that.

90
00:05:12.877 --> 00:05:15.140
I know everyone
meets online these days.

91
00:05:15.706 --> 00:05:16.794
but you know what I miss?

92
00:05:17.012 --> 00:05:17.882
What?

93
00:05:18.622 --> 00:05:20.755
That feeling of being
in a crowded place

94
00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:22.974
and your eyes
just happen to collide

95
00:05:23.061 --> 00:05:24.236
with someone across the room.

96
00:05:25.673 --> 00:05:26.935
Everything else
just disappears.

97
00:05:27.065 --> 00:05:28.284
and it's just the two of you.

98
00:05:30.982 --> 00:05:32.114
What about you. Gus?

99
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.072
Do you ever think
of that sort of thing?

100
00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:36.292
I have a little bit
of a confession.

101
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.467
Um...

102
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.383
my name's not Gus.

103
00:05:40.992 --> 00:05:42.516
I... I mean. it'’s...
it'’s... it's...

104
00:05:42.603 --> 00:05:44.648
it sort of is Gus. It's my--
Gus is my middle name.

105
00:05:44.735 --> 00:05:46.346
but my name's Nick.

106
00:05:46.955 --> 00:05:48.957
So why does it say "Gus"
on your profile?

107
00:05:49.044 --> 00:05:50.698
I don't know. I'’m--

108
00:05:50.785 --> 00:05:52.308
I guess I didn't really want

109
00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:55.311
people who might know me
to know that I'm--

110
00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:57.444
Looking for love online?

111
00:05:57.618 --> 00:06:00.055
Yeah!
Yeah. something like that.

112
00:06:00.142 --> 00:06:01.622
- Are you married?
- What?

113
00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:04.625
No! No. no. no.
No. no. no. I'm not married.

114
00:06:05.495 --> 00:06:06.409
Nick...

115
00:06:06.757 --> 00:06:08.846
No matter what happens

116
00:06:08.977 --> 00:06:10.370
or doesn't happen between us.

117
00:06:11.109 --> 00:06:12.372
I just have one request.

118
00:06:14.417 --> 00:06:16.898
I need you
to be 100% honest with me.

119
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.378
I mean it.

120
00:06:18.682 --> 00:06:20.423
Can you do that?

121
00:06:20.815 --> 00:06:21.903
Absolutely.

122
00:06:23.644 --> 00:06:25.385
How about a nightcap?

123
00:06:26.951 --> 00:06:28.388
We are not sleeping together.

124
00:06:28.997 --> 00:06:31.042
at least. not anytime soon.

125
00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:33.654
Hey. who said anything
about sleeping together?

126
00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:36.221
Geez. is sex
all you think about?

127
00:06:36.308 --> 00:06:37.614
My goodness!

128
00:06:37.962 --> 00:06:38.920
Anna.

129
00:06:39.224 --> 00:06:40.574
Come on. One drink?

130
00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:42.314
- Okay.
- All right.

Why do you never come inside?

153
00:08:23.894 --> 00:08:25.461
You know all those crazies
give me the creeps.

154
00:08:25.592 --> 00:08:27.071
They're not crazy. Zoe.

155
00:08:27.202 --> 00:08:28.769
You're looking at me
like I'm the weirdo.

156
00:08:28.899 --> 00:08:30.248
and you're friends
with the fucking pigeons?

157
00:08:30.335 --> 00:08:31.989
She's not normally like that.
I'm so sorry.

158
00:08:32.076 --> 00:08:33.251
Your pigeons are adorable.

159
00:08:33.948 --> 00:08:35.166
Why are you ignoring my texts?

160
00:08:35.645 --> 00:08:36.559
I'm not.

161
00:08:37.168 --> 00:08:39.040
I just had a busy morning.

162
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:40.781
For all I knew. you could've
been raped and murdered

163
00:08:40.868 --> 00:08:41.738
by your date.

164
00:08:42.173 --> 00:08:43.697
What was his name? Gus?

165
00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:44.959
Actually. it's Nick.

166
00:08:45.046 --> 00:08:46.134
Who's Nick?

167
00:08:47.831 --> 00:08:48.832
Gus is Nick.

168
00:08:49.746 --> 00:08:51.574
Not that Gus is a fake name.
It's not.

169
00:08:51.705 --> 00:08:53.358
It's his middle name.
He just-- He's--

170
00:08:53.489 --> 00:08:55.099
- Married.
- No.

171
00:08:55.186 --> 00:08:56.144
What's he hiding?

172
00:08:56.231 --> 00:08:57.493
Nothing. Zoe.

173
00:08:58.886 --> 00:09:00.322
I actually really liked him.

174
00:09:00.975 --> 00:09:02.716
He did the most romantic thing
after dinner.

175
00:09:03.238 --> 00:09:04.587
What? Try to fuck you?

176
00:09:04.674 --> 00:09:06.763
No. It was a first date.

177
00:09:06.894 --> 00:09:07.808
Why? Is he gay?

178
00:09:08.678 --> 00:09:09.853
Did you follow me yesterday?

179
00:09:09.984 --> 00:09:11.507
When have
I ever followed you. sis?

180
00:09:11.638 --> 00:09:13.291
I saw you at the bar
last night. Zoe.

181
00:09:13.378 --> 00:09:15.119
I was at lots of bars
last night.

Nick.

00:09:21.343 --> 00:09:22.431
Nick. right.

186
00:09:22.953 --> 00:09:24.476

rhymes with--

187
00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:25.434
Be nice.

188

Hi. Daddy.

219
00:11:19.853 --> 00:11:21.332
Can I make you a drink?

220
00:11:33.214 --> 00:11:34.345
Guess not.

221
00:12:00.981 --> 00:12:02.330
Is that my Zoe?

222
00:12:03.766 --> 00:12:05.550
You always did
prefer Anna's bedroom.

223
00:12:05.637 --> 00:12:07.074
even when you were little.

224
00:12:08.597 --> 00:12:10.033
We used to try
and switch places.

225
00:12:10.599 --> 00:12:11.513
trick you.

226
00:12:12.035 --> 00:12:13.123
That never worked on me.

227
00:12:13.254 --> 00:12:15.430
I could tell my girls apart. blindfolded.

228
00:12:15.691 --> 00:12:16.953
We got you once or twice.

229
00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:17.954
No!

230
00:12:18.215 --> 00:12:20.217
Yeah. Dad was easier.

231
00:12:21.131 --> 00:12:22.045
Shocking.

232
00:12:23.264 --> 00:12:25.092
You know. he wouldn't even
look me in the eye?

233
00:12:25.614 --> 00:12:27.572
Honey. you can't let that
get to you.

234
00:12:27.659 --> 00:12:29.400
He's just obsessed
with his work right now.

235
00:12:29.661 --> 00:12:30.750
Very stressed.

236
00:12:32.882 --> 00:12:34.492
So what's going on. darling?

237
00:12:35.406 --> 00:12:36.581
Anna met someone.

238
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.410
Really? Who?

239
00:12:39.933 --> 00:12:41.804
Nick Hudson.

240
00:12:42.674 --> 00:12:44.154
He's rich and handsome.

241
00:12:46.678 --> 00:12:48.680
Well. that sounds
promising. hmm?

242
00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:49.986
I don't trust him.

243
00:12:52.641 --> 00:12:53.642
Why not?

244
00:12:54.469 --> 00:12:56.732
I spied on them a teensy bit
on their first date.

245
00:12:57.385 --> 00:12:59.082
Darling. I don't think
you should do that.

246
00:12:59.256 --> 00:13:01.824
He's way too hot not to be
a complete asshole.

247
00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:04.435
Maybe this one is different.

248
00:13:04.522 --> 00:13:05.785
They're all the same.

249
00:13:07.003 --> 00:13:09.005
Anna's just too sweet
to know the difference.

250
00:13:11.616 --> 00:13:12.661
Whoa-ho!

251
00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:15.838
Slow down there. cowgirl.
I can't keep up.

252
00:13:16.491 --> 00:13:17.535
You should try.

253
00:13:39.122 --> 00:13:40.384
Fuck!

254
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:42.299
Ivan--Fuck off!

255
00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:43.823
- Hey! Hey!
- Fuck off!

256
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:45.259
What the hell's
wrong with you. man?

257
00:13:45.346 --> 00:13:46.260
Wait. Nick!

258
00:13:46.651 --> 00:13:47.652
You stay the hell away
from her. you hear me?

259
00:13:47.783 --> 00:13:49.045
No! Stop. stop. stop.

260
00:13:49.132 --> 00:13:51.047
It's okay. it's okay.
Ivan. you know what to do.

261
00:13:51.265 --> 00:13:52.527
It's okay. I promise.

262
00:13:52.614 --> 00:13:53.833
Yeah.

263
00:13:58.663 --> 00:14:01.144
You have... Tourette's?

264
00:14:01.623 --> 00:14:02.580
Yeah.

265
00:14:02.667 --> 00:14:03.973
- I'm so sorry.
-It really

266
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.193
fucking sucks!

267
00:14:06.497 --> 00:14:07.542
What happened?

268
00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:09.979
Another fucking rejection.

269
00:14:10.284 --> 00:14:12.242
Sorry that I... Cock-sucking!

270
00:14:12.982 --> 00:14:13.896
...yelled.

271
00:14:14.244 --> 00:14:15.680
Ivan's been job hunting.
and it hasn't been easy.

272
00:14:15.767 --> 00:14:16.638
Oh.

273
00:14:16.943 --> 00:14:18.945
Ivan. this is. um. my--

274
00:14:19.597 --> 00:14:20.642
Boyfriend.

275
00:14:22.078 --> 00:14:23.558
My boyfriend. Nick.

276
00:14:24.124 --> 00:14:27.997
Anna's the. uh. nicest person
I've ever met.

277
00:14:28.563 --> 00:14:30.739
You're pretty... F--

278
00:14:30.957 --> 00:14:31.871
...lucky.

279
00:14:32.306 --> 00:14:33.960
Hey. it's a pleasure
to meet you. Ivan.

280
00:14:34.047 --> 00:14:35.787
I'm sorry to hear
you're having a rough time.

281
00:14:36.919 --> 00:14:38.442
Hey. why don't we go
get some coffee?

282
00:14:38.529 --> 00:14:39.487
I was just closing up.

283
00:14:39.835 --> 00:14:40.967
but you know I always
have time for my friends.

284
00:14:42.316 --> 00:14:43.186
Yeah.

285
00:14:43.752 --> 00:14:45.580
Yeah? Let's do it.

286
00:14:48.017 --> 00:14:48.975
Hey. Nick?

287
00:14:50.628 --> 00:14:52.326
I'm sorry if this makes us
miss the movie.

288
00:14:52.456 --> 00:14:55.372
You have no idea
how wonderful you are. do you?

289
00:15:06.775 --> 00:15:10.213
Oh. wow!
Anna. this is incredible.

290
00:15:10.692 --> 00:15:12.085
Thank you. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY]

291
00:15:12.433 --> 00:15:13.651
Is it. uh.

292
00:15:14.391 --> 00:15:16.872
too rude to ask
how you can afford this place?

293
00:15:17.786 --> 00:15:19.962
I mean. I imagine the reward
of working at shelters

294
00:15:20.093 --> 00:15:22.834
is helping people.
not a big paycheck.

295
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.314
Hmm.

296
00:15:27.404 --> 00:15:28.362
Wow!

297
00:15:29.232 --> 00:15:30.233
It's not rude.

a bit of a trust fund.

Leave me alone.

373

374
00:19:13.587 --> 00:19:14.588
Who was in my room?

375
00:19:14.718 --> 00:19:15.763
It was just Nick.

376
00:19:16.111 --> 00:19:17.504
looking at
that cute photo of us.

377
00:19:17.591 --> 00:19:19.593
You know I don't like people
messing with my stuff.

378
00:19:20.246 --> 00:19:21.725
He wasn't messing with anything.

379
00:19:22.117 --> 00:19:22.987
I promise.

380
00:19:29.994 --> 00:19:31.692
Hey. Rebecca. Can I call you
in. like. five minutes?

381
00:19:31.779 --> 00:19:32.867

What happened? Is she okay?

384
00:19:35.783 --> 00:19:37.654
No cell phones allowed in here.

385
00:19:38.177 --> 00:19:39.265

She already had surgery.

389
00:19:50.754 --> 00:19:51.929
they found something bad.

390
00:19:55.368 --> 00:19:56.412

Uh. it's my mom.
She broke her hip.

Okay. thanks.

Hi. sweetie.

413
00:20:57.212 --> 00:20:58.866
Hi. Mom.

414
00:20:59.301 --> 00:21:02.391
I think I finally understand
why people do drugs.

415
00:21:06.308 --> 00:21:07.266
Um...

416
00:21:08.005 --> 00:21:09.093
so. Mom--

417
00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:10.356
It's okay. sweetheart.

418
00:21:10.704 --> 00:21:12.401
The doctor told me everything.

419
00:21:13.097 --> 00:21:16.144
You know. whatever happens.
I'm a lucky woman.

420
00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.713
I had the best kids
in the whole world.

421
00:21:23.499 --> 00:21:24.457
Who's this?

422
00:21:25.458 --> 00:21:26.372
Hi.

423
00:21:27.024 --> 00:21:28.504
I'm Anna. Mrs. Hudson.

424
00:21:29.505 --> 00:21:30.680
A friend of Nick's.

425
00:21:31.812 --> 00:21:33.466
A special friend. I hope?

426
00:21:34.945 --> 00:21:35.990
Are your feet cold?

427
00:21:36.338 --> 00:21:37.992
Oh. I can find you some socks.

428
00:21:38.471 --> 00:21:39.515
Oh. uh--

429
00:21:39.907 --> 00:21:42.388
That's very sweet of you.
but you don't have to do that.

430
00:21:42.518 --> 00:21:43.563
I don't mind.

431
00:21:43.693 --> 00:21:45.652
Did your daughter
bring you anything?

432
00:21:48.132 --> 00:21:49.177
Got 'em.

433
00:21:49.264 --> 00:21:50.439
How did you know?

434
00:21:52.746 --> 00:21:54.922
I just wanna make sure
you are cozy.

435
00:22:00.884 --> 00:22:02.190
Why don't we get some dinner?

436
00:22:03.844 --> 00:22:05.019
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

437
00:22:06.977 --> 00:22:08.370
You still have time with her.

438
00:22:10.416 --> 00:22:12.200
We're gonna help her
fight this. okay?

439
00:22:12.853 --> 00:22:13.767
Yeah.

440
00:22:15.159 --> 00:22:16.204
Yeah.

441
00:22:23.646 --> 00:22:24.604
Hey.

442
00:22:28.259 --> 00:22:29.348
Will you marry me?

443
00:22:29.435 --> 00:22:31.828
I... I... I already
fucked this up.

444
00:22:32.002 --> 00:22:34.309
I don't even have a ring.
but we'll go
pick one out together.

445
00:22:35.484 --> 00:22:36.877
Life is too short

446
00:22:37.573 --> 00:22:39.401
and I wanna spend
the rest of mine with you.

447
00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:41.185
- Yes.
-Yes?

448
00:22:41.272 --> 00:22:43.100
- Yes?
-Yes! Oh. my God!

449
00:22:45.146 --> 00:22:47.235
- I love you.
- Mm. I love you.

450
00:22:47.801 --> 00:22:49.150
Oh! Becs!

451
00:22:49.455 --> 00:22:51.674
Uh. Anna.
this is my sister. Rebecca.

452
00:22:51.761 --> 00:22:54.068
Uh. Rebecca. this is Anna.
my. uh...

453
00:22:54.155 --> 00:22:55.591
Fiancée. apparently?

454
00:22:55.939 --> 00:22:57.027
Yeah. Yeah.

455
00:22:57.114 --> 00:22:59.247
It's so nice
to meet you. Rebecca.

456
00:23:00.466 --> 00:23:01.380
Wow!

457
00:23:03.033 --> 00:23:04.513
How long have
you guys known each other?

458
00:23:05.688 --> 00:23:06.907
How long has it been?

459
00:23:07.124 --> 00:23:08.778
- Six weeks.
- Six weeks.

460
00:23:08.865 --> 00:23:11.564
Well... congrats! I guess.

461
00:23:12.347 --> 00:23:13.304
How's Mom?

462
00:23:13.783 --> 00:23:16.307
Yeah. you know--She's doing so well. mentally.

463
00:23:16.438 --> 00:23:17.526
-Yeah.
-I mean. obviously.

464
00:23:17.874 --> 00:23:20.399
there's a tough road ahead.
but Pamela's a fighter.

465
00:23:21.095 --> 00:23:22.096
Mm.

466
00:23:23.445 --> 00:23:25.839
Okay. then.
I'm gonna go see the fighter.

467
00:23:29.756 --> 00:23:30.757
Excuse me.

468
00:23:32.541 --> 00:23:34.064
It was really nice
to meet you. Becs.

469
00:23:35.196 --> 00:23:36.545
Yeah. Yeah.

470
00:23:38.678 --> 00:23:41.289
- Was I too much?
- No. you're never too much.

471
00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.551
You were perfect.

472
00:23:43.552 --> 00:23:45.554
Becca just takes some time
to warm up to people.

473
00:23:45.685 --> 00:23:46.555
that's all.

474
00:23:48.557 --> 00:23:50.167
- Are we crazy?
- No.

475
00:23:51.255 --> 00:23:52.343
- Okay. yeah. maybe a little.
- Yeah.

476
00:23:53.432 --> 00:23:54.345
<i>Are you fucking crazy?</i>

477
00:23:54.868 --> 00:23:55.912
You just met him!

478
00:23:55.999 --> 00:23:57.218
I mean. what the fuck. Anna?

479
00:23:57.305 --> 00:23:58.175
I didn't just meet him.

480
00:23:58.262 --> 00:23:59.394
Yes. you did.

481
00:23:59.655 --> 00:24:01.309
You haven't even
introduced me to him yet.

482
00:24:01.527 --> 00:24:02.397
Why?

483
00:24:02.484 --> 00:24:03.485
You haven't asked.

484
00:24:04.051 --> 00:24:05.400
It's because you know I'll see
right through his bullshit.

485
00:24:05.835 --> 00:24:07.010
He's a player. isn't he?

486
00:24:07.271 --> 00:24:08.403
You always trust so easily.

487
00:24:08.577 --> 00:24:09.752
He's not a player. Zoe.

488
00:24:09.839 --> 00:24:11.232
Bet he's got
a kid hidden away somewhere.

489
00:24:11.493 --> 00:24:12.755
- No.
- Divorced?

490
00:24:12.929 --> 00:24:14.322
No! It's nothing like that.

491
00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:15.976
Why'd he split up
with his last ex?

492
00:24:16.629 --> 00:24:18.413
Think. Anna. Think.

493
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:19.458
I don't know.

494
00:24:19.719 --> 00:24:21.242
We haven't talked
about any serious exes.

495
00:24:21.634 --> 00:24:22.591
There you go.

496
00:24:23.026 --> 00:24:24.288
He's afraid of commitment.

497
00:24:24.375 --> 00:24:26.639
Afraid of commitment?
He proposed to me. Zoe!

498
00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:29.555
Where's the ring?

499
00:24:30.991 --> 00:24:32.253
Oh. my God. Anna.

500
00:24:32.558 --> 00:24:33.994
It was
a spur-of-the-moment thing.

501
00:24:34.908 --> 00:24:36.387
That's what made it
so romantic.

502
00:24:36.692 --> 00:24:37.693
Don't you get that?

503
00:24:39.173 --> 00:24:40.391
What is wrong with you?

504
00:24:41.654 --> 00:24:42.785
Are you just so damaged

505
00:24:42.872 --> 00:24:44.047

believe in anyone?

00:26:03.387 --> 00:26:04.301
Oh. thank you.

541
00:26:04.388 --> 00:26:06.129
You look great.

542
00:26:06.913 --> 00:26:08.349
This... is Nick.

543
00:26:08.436 --> 00:26:09.698
- Pleasure to meet you. sir.
-Oh. no.

544
00:26:09.829 --> 00:26:11.570
It's David. It's David.
Nice to meet you.

545
00:26:11.657 --> 00:26:13.267
Oh. my God. Champagne? Wow.

546
00:26:13.354 --> 00:26:14.529
We're celebrating. huh?

547
00:26:14.616 --> 00:26:15.835
Yeah.
Beautiful.

548
00:26:15.922 --> 00:26:16.923
Thank you.

549
00:26:17.837 --> 00:26:18.664
We're getting married!

550
00:26:19.229 --> 00:26:20.883
- What?
- Oh?

551
00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:21.971
Yeah!

552
00:26:22.058 --> 00:26:23.146
- Oh!
- Wow. Uh--

553
00:26:23.451 --> 00:26:24.844
-Wow.
- Isn't it so pretty?

554
00:26:25.105 --> 00:26:26.541
Wow. I guess
- we really are celebrating.
- It's extraordinary.

555
00:26:26.628 --> 00:26:27.586
What do you think?

556
00:26:27.673 --> 00:26:29.239
It's beautiful. Congratulations.

557
00:26:29.326 --> 00:26:31.067
Um. so. uh.
we'll get this on some ice.

558
00:26:31.154 --> 00:26:33.287
and we've got some
hors d'oeuvres on the island.

559
00:26:33.374 --> 00:26:34.854
- Come on.
- Yeah. All right.

560
00:26:36.116 --> 00:26:37.247
We'll get that
on some ice.

561
00:26:44.385 --> 00:26:45.908
<i>So tell me
about yourself. Nick.</i>

562
00:26:45.995 --> 00:26:46.909
<i>So. where are you from?</i>

563
00:26:47.301 --> 00:26:48.345
I'm from Westdale.

564
00:26:48.432 --> 00:26:49.825
- Oh. okay.
- Yeah. born and raised.

565
00:26:49.912 --> 00:26:51.087
Uh-huh.

566
00:26:51.522 --> 00:26:53.786
And... and how long have. uh.
you and Anna known each other?

567
00:26:53.873 --> 00:26:56.179
Oh. gosh. only about two months.

568
00:26:57.746 --> 00:26:59.487
Yeah.

569
00:26:59.661 --> 00:27:02.142
Um. I know that this
must seem impulsive.

570
00:27:02.359 --> 00:27:04.927
but I'm very serious
about your daughter.

571
00:27:06.102 --> 00:27:07.756
I've never met anyone like her.

572
00:27:08.496 --> 00:27:11.325
Under normal circumstances.
we would've taken more time.

573
00:27:11.412 --> 00:27:14.067
and I would've asked
for your permission.

574
00:27:14.415 --> 00:27:16.286
I apologize for that. but...

575
00:27:18.506 --> 00:27:20.377
And... and what else
has Anna told you

576
00:27:20.508 --> 00:27:21.727
about. uh. her past?

577
00:27:22.553 --> 00:27:23.554
Uh...

578
00:27:24.338 --> 00:27:25.644
I guess just the basics.

579
00:27:26.645 --> 00:27:27.602
Why do you ask?

580
00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:32.607
Aw! Look at my two men
getting to know each other.

581
00:27:33.652 --> 00:27:34.653
Dinner's ready.

582
00:27:35.566 --> 00:27:37.133
- Great.
-All right.

583
00:27:38.265 --> 00:27:39.222
Bon appétit.

584
00:27:39.353 --> 00:27:41.094
Wow. this looks delicious.

585
00:27:41.572 --> 00:27:42.791
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

586
00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.532
No plate for Zoe?

587
00:27:45.576 --> 00:27:48.231
Oh. uh...
Zo... Zoe won't be joining us.

588
00:27:48.971 --> 00:27:50.756
Why not? She said she'd come.

589
00:27:50.886 --> 00:27:52.583
Oh. she told me she was busy.

590
00:27:53.193 --> 00:27:54.194
Busy with what?

591
00:27:54.498 --> 00:27:56.283
I don't know. Anna.
You'll have to ask her.

592
00:27:56.413 --> 00:27:59.025
Oh. well. looking forward
to meeting her.

593
00:27:59.112 --> 00:28:00.156
at some point.

594
00:28:01.854 --> 00:28:02.855
So. uh...

595
00:28:03.116 --> 00:28:05.161
when were you two thinking
of having the wedding?

596
00:28:05.248 --> 00:28:07.250
- Alexia.
- What?

597
00:28:07.424 --> 00:28:08.991
There's no need to pressure them

598
00:28:09.078 --> 00:28:11.080
into some kind of
arbitrary date. I think.

599
00:28:11.211 --> 00:28:12.952
I'm... I'm sure you wanna take
your time. right?

600
00:28:13.039 --> 00:28:14.170
No. that's not what I'm--

601
00:28:14.257 --> 00:28:15.868
I was actually thinking
sooner than later.

602
00:28:16.564 --> 00:28:17.870
Well... how soon?

603
00:28:18.653 --> 00:28:20.829
Maybe in. like. six weeks or so?

604
00:28:21.438 --> 00:28:22.309
Oh...

605
00:28:23.397 --> 00:28:25.660
darling. tha... that's way
too short a time

606
00:28:25.791 --> 00:28:27.183
to plan a proper wedding.

607
00:28:27.836 --> 00:28:28.924
Yeah. but...

608
00:28:30.534 --> 00:28:32.841
we're not sure how much time
we have left with Nick's mom.

609
00:28:32.928 --> 00:28:33.886
so I just wanna make sure

610
00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:35.714
that she's healthy enough
to enjoy the day.

611
00:28:36.279 --> 00:28:38.238
Oh. I... I'm sorry.
I didn't know. I'm...

612
00:28:40.719 --> 00:28:41.763
Please. It's okay.

613
00:28:42.764 --> 00:28:44.287
What if we have it here?

614
00:28:45.201 --> 00:28:46.463
The ceremony. out back?

615
00:28:46.768 --> 00:28:48.074
It'd be perfect.

616
00:28:49.553 --> 00:28:50.554
What do you think. Nick?

617
00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.035
Oh. gosh. I mean.

618
00:28:53.122 --> 00:28:54.863
it's a beautiful home. but...

619
00:28:55.777 --> 00:28:56.996
we don't want to impose.

620
00:28:57.213 --> 00:28:58.345
Oh. don't be silly.

621
00:28:58.475 --> 00:28:59.520
It's settled.

622
00:29:00.347 --> 00:29:01.348
Cheers.

623
00:29:02.871 --> 00:29:03.785
Yeah. Cheers.

624
00:29:03.872 --> 00:29:04.743
Cheers.

625
00:29:05.787 --> 00:29:06.745
Thanks. Daddy.

626
00:29:07.006 --> 00:29:07.876
Cheers.

627
00:29:10.096 --> 00:29:11.488
This really is delicious.

628
00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:13.664
Told you.

629
00:29:13.839 --> 00:29:16.232
<i>Whoo!</i>

630
00:29:16.363 --> 00:29:18.408
<i>Mom. thanks for having us.</i>

631
00:29:18.495 --> 00:29:19.801
Mom--

632
00:29:19.932 --> 00:29:21.107
Oh. ho. ho.

633
00:29:21.324 --> 00:29:23.152
Okay. I honestly don't think
you should have any. Mom.

634
00:29:23.283 --> 00:29:25.720
Oh. Rebecca! Of course I should.

635
00:29:25.851 --> 00:29:28.027
Moments like this
need to be celebrated properly.

636
00:29:28.723 --> 00:29:32.118
Here's to the future
Mr. and Mrs. Nicholas Hudson.

637
00:29:32.205 --> 00:29:33.119
Cheers!

638
00:29:33.206 --> 00:29:34.294
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

639
00:29:36.122 --> 00:29:38.124
Okay. not too much. Mom.
You're on way too many meds.

640
00:29:38.211 --> 00:29:39.647
Calm down! She's fine.

641
00:29:40.039 --> 00:29:42.389
Anna.
why don't you sit next to me?

642
00:29:42.998 --> 00:29:44.478
And I wanna hear all about

643
00:29:44.565 --> 00:29:45.914
what you're thinking
for the wedding.

644
00:29:46.001 --> 00:29:47.481
Oh. I love that.

645
00:29:50.266 --> 00:29:51.398
Rebecca.

646
00:29:51.528 --> 00:29:53.661
scoot over so Anna can sit down.

647
00:29:55.315 --> 00:29:56.533
- Come on.
-Excuse me. Becs.

648
00:29:58.231 --> 00:29:59.885
Well. I don't have
all the details planned out yet.

649
00:30:00.233 --> 00:30:02.104
Oh. come on.
Be honest with me. Anna.

650
00:30:02.191 --> 00:30:04.367
You've been planning this
since you were a little girl.

651
00:30:04.454 --> 00:30:05.325
haven't you?

652
00:30:08.719 --> 00:30:09.677
Maybe a little.

653
00:30:11.157 --> 00:30:12.332
Every girl does.

654
00:30:13.507 --> 00:30:14.464
Not me.

655
00:30:15.074 --> 00:30:16.031
<i>What?</i>

656
00:30:16.162 --> 00:30:17.859
Mom wants
to leave you everything?

657
00:30:18.251 --> 00:30:19.556
You've gotta be fucking kidding.

658
00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:21.602
Don't look at me!
It was her decision.

659
00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:23.430
- I'm sure it was.
- Yeah. it was!

660
00:30:23.517 --> 00:30:25.345
- Okay. Yeah.
- Are you guys okay?

661
00:30:25.432 --> 00:30:26.825
Yup. I was just leaving.

662
00:30:29.001 --> 00:30:29.958
Hey. Rebecca?

663
00:30:30.654 --> 00:30:32.004
I just have a quick question.

664
00:30:32.439 --> 00:30:33.440
Yup?

665
00:30:35.224 --> 00:30:36.617
Would you be a bridesmaid?

666
00:30:37.487 --> 00:30:39.489
I know it's a lot.
and it's crazy right now.

667
00:30:39.576 --> 00:30:40.795
and there's a lot going on.
but...

668
00:30:41.491 --> 00:30:43.711
I would really. really love it
if you were in the wedding.

669
00:30:43.972 --> 00:30:45.713
I'll make it easy.
It's just you and Zoe.

670
00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:48.063
the ceremony is small.
and I'm rambling now. but...

671
00:30:48.194 --> 00:30:50.065
I would really love it.
It would mean so much to me.

672
00:30:50.152 --> 00:30:50.979
What do you think?

673
00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:55.418
- Okay. sure. Why not. yeah.
-Really?

674
00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:56.767
- Yay! I'm so excited!
- Yay. Ow!

675
00:30:56.855 --> 00:30:57.899
- That was my toe.
-Sorry. sorry.

676
00:30:57.986 --> 00:30:59.858
I'm so excited! Thank you!

677
00:31:00.162 --> 00:31:01.250
I'm so excited!

678
00:31:01.381 --> 00:31:02.338
Okay. Can you--

679
00:31:02.512 --> 00:31:03.818
- It's gonna be so fun!
- All right.

680
00:31:07.735 --> 00:31:08.692
Bye.

681
00:31:19.921 --> 00:31:22.619
So you're just gonna let her
marry this complete stranger?

682
00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:24.186
<i>What would you have me do?</i>

683
00:31:24.578 --> 00:31:26.145
<i>Nick seems like a nice man.</i>

684
00:31:26.536 --> 00:31:28.147
<i>Anna is very set on him.</i>

685
00:31:28.451 --> 00:31:30.018
Anna doesn't know her own mind.

686
00:31:30.192 --> 00:31:31.933
<i>What do you mean by that. Zoe?</i>

687
00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:33.500
<i>Please don't do anything rash.</i>

688
00:31:33.674 --> 00:31:35.371
Mother.

689
00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.809
When have I ever
done anything rash?

690
00:31:42.813 --> 00:31:43.684
This is Nick.

691
00:31:43.814 --> 00:31:45.555
<i>Nick. It's Zoe.</i>

692
00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:47.644
- Zoe?
-<i>Anna's sister.</i>

693
00:31:47.731 --> 00:31:49.690
<i>Come on. man. you should
know this shit by now.</i>

694
00:31:49.777 --> 00:31:50.821
Oh. Zoe!

695
00:31:51.039 --> 00:31:52.301
Yeah. of course. Sorry.

696
00:31:52.388 --> 00:31:54.042
We've just never.
uh. talked before.

697
00:31:54.129 --> 00:31:55.217
<i>Time to change that.</i>

698
00:31:55.696 --> 00:31:57.437
<i>Let's meet for dinner. Tonight.</i>

699
00:31:57.959 --> 00:31:59.439
Uh. okay.

700
00:31:59.569 --> 00:32:01.006
Yeah. I'll see if Anna's free.

701
00:32:01.093 --> 00:32:03.269
<i>No Anna. She doesn't
need to know about this.</i>

702
00:32:03.399 --> 00:32:04.705
<i>If you're really
gonna marry her.</i>

703
00:32:04.792 --> 00:32:06.620
<i>we need to talk. Alone.</i>

704
00:32:07.708 --> 00:32:08.752
Talk about what?

705
00:32:08.927 --> 00:32:10.667
<i>I'll text the details.</i>

706
00:32:14.541 --> 00:32:15.585
Okay.

707
00:32:27.902 --> 00:32:29.469
<i>♪ Uh-huh</i>

708
00:32:31.601 --> 00:32:33.038
<i>♪ Uh-huh</i>

709
00:32:34.909 --> 00:32:37.129
<i>♪ Uh-huh-huh</i>

00:32:39.783 --> 00:32:41.655

<i>♪ Uh-huh-huh</i>

712
00:32:49.141 --> 00:32:50.490
You must be Nick.

713
00:32:52.013 --> 00:32:53.449
And this must be my drink.

714
00:33:01.544 --> 00:33:02.719
Two more. please.

715
00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:09.248
Do you talk?

716
00:33:10.292 --> 00:33:11.206
Yes.

717
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:13.469
Yes. I talk.

718
00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:19.171
Sorry. uh. it's just...

719
00:33:19.693 --> 00:33:20.824
I look just like her?

720
00:33:20.955 --> 00:33:24.089
Yeah. Uh...

721
00:33:24.306 --> 00:33:27.657
it takes some getting used to.
is all.

722
00:33:28.528 --> 00:33:29.485
Groundbreaking.

723
00:33:30.225 --> 00:33:31.139
So.

724
00:33:31.661 --> 00:33:32.923
you're marrying my sister?

725
00:33:33.228 --> 00:33:34.751
Yes. Yes. I am.

726
00:33:35.361 --> 00:33:36.405
Do you love her?

727
00:33:36.536 --> 00:33:38.190
Oh. more than anything.

728
00:33:38.668 --> 00:33:40.322
Well. you still have
multiple dating profiles up.

729
00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:41.802
Hmm?

730
00:33:43.717 --> 00:33:45.197
This isn't you?

731
00:33:46.676 --> 00:33:47.721
Thank you.

732
00:33:47.851 --> 00:33:48.896
Gus?

733
00:33:53.553 --> 00:33:54.554
Yeah.

734
00:33:54.858 --> 00:33:58.297
Yeah. but. I mean.
I don't use that anymore.

735
00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.734
Then why is it still up?

736
00:34:01.169 --> 00:34:03.606
I honestly just forgot about it.

737
00:34:03.693 --> 00:34:04.738
Hmm.

738
00:34:05.217 --> 00:34:06.783
Well. you took down the one
that you met Anna through.

739
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:08.307
so you're not a total idiot.
I'll give you that.

740
00:34:08.785 --> 00:34:10.091
Yeah. thank you.

741
00:34:10.265 --> 00:34:13.007
Uh. Zoe. we can take that--
we can delete it. right now.

742
00:34:13.094 --> 00:34:14.487
Let's see what Gus has to say.

743
00:34:15.227 --> 00:34:17.055
"I'm a glass-half-full
kind of guy.

744
00:34:17.142 --> 00:34:18.665
and I love laughing."

745
00:34:18.752 --> 00:34:21.146
No shit. dude.
Who doesn't love laughing?

746
00:34:22.408 --> 00:34:23.887
"I like going out
and staying in."

747
00:34:24.497 --> 00:34:26.586
Wow! Congratulations. Nick.

748
00:34:26.673 --> 00:34:27.848
You like existing.

749
00:34:28.588 --> 00:34:29.893
I'm starving. Feed me.

750
00:34:54.875 --> 00:34:55.963
So what do you do?

751
00:34:57.356 --> 00:34:58.531
Anna hasn't told you?

752
00:34:59.009 --> 00:35:00.533
No. I don't believe
she's mentioned it.

753
00:35:01.273 --> 00:35:03.449
Mm. Probably not.

754
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:04.928
She doesn't totally approve.

755
00:35:06.452 --> 00:35:07.670
I'm an actress and a model.

756
00:35:08.454 --> 00:35:09.455
Had a gig today.

757
00:35:09.542 --> 00:35:11.239
Oh. That's cool.

758
00:35:11.326 --> 00:35:12.240
What was it?

759
00:35:13.154 --> 00:35:14.590
Modeling slutty underwear.

760
00:35:15.417 --> 00:35:16.549
The usual bullshit.

761
00:35:17.158 --> 00:35:18.159
They point a fan at you

762
00:35:18.464 --> 00:35:19.987
to make your hair billow
and your nipples pop.

763
00:35:22.032 --> 00:35:23.077
Super.

764
00:35:29.997 --> 00:35:31.259
Oh. sorry.

765
00:35:37.918 --> 00:35:38.832
Uh--

766
00:35:38.919 --> 00:35:39.920
What about you. Nick?

767
00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:41.661
Please tell me more.

768
00:35:41.748 --> 00:35:43.358
Uh. I'm an investment banker.

769
00:35:43.924 --> 00:35:45.839
I work
in equity capital markets--

770
00:35:45.926 --> 00:35:47.406
I know all that shit.
Anna's told me.

771
00:35:48.842 --> 00:35:51.366
Tell me something new.
something I don't know.

772
00:35:51.758 --> 00:35:54.456
Uh. well. what would
you like to know?

773
00:35:54.848 --> 00:35:56.023
You know what I mean.

774
00:35:56.545 --> 00:35:58.678
Tell me something else
you've kept hidden from Anna.

775
00:35:58.939 --> 00:36:01.594
Zoe. I honestly forgot
about those dating profiles.

776
00:36:01.898 --> 00:36:03.639
Really.
I have not been logging on.

777
00:36:03.726 --> 00:36:05.337
I can prove it to you
right now. if you want.

778
00:36:06.903 --> 00:36:08.340
Are you saying
you never lie to her?

779
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:09.384
No!

780
00:36:11.038 --> 00:36:12.387
Did you tell her about tonight?

781
00:36:14.607 --> 00:36:15.825
You told me not to.

782
00:36:16.696 --> 00:36:18.350
You didn't have
to listen to me. Nick.

783
00:36:20.352 --> 00:36:21.353
Thank you.

784
00:36:23.137 --> 00:36:24.312
What'd you think of our family?

785
00:36:24.791 --> 00:36:25.922
Your parents are very nice.

786
00:36:26.401 --> 00:36:27.402
Oh? Are they?

787
00:36:27.576 --> 00:36:28.490
Yeah.

788
00:36:28.795 --> 00:36:30.057
Yeah. I mean.
they were a bit surprised

789
00:36:30.144 --> 00:36:32.190
about the engagement. understandably.

790
00:36:35.105 --> 00:36:36.716
I've been protecting Anna
my whole life.

791
00:36:37.151 --> 00:36:38.326
I'm not gonna stop now.

792
00:36:38.413 --> 00:36:41.199
Mm. I appreciate that.

793
00:36:42.722 --> 00:36:44.158
Anna is delicate.

794
00:36:45.028 --> 00:36:46.682
She's had some tough times
in her life.

795
00:36:46.987 --> 00:36:48.206
She deserves to be happy.

796
00:36:49.729 --> 00:36:51.948
What sort of tough times?

797
00:36:53.428 --> 00:36:55.082
I'm not gonna
let you hurt her. Nick.

798
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:56.997
She's already had
one terrible marriage.

799
00:36:57.345 --> 00:36:58.390
Nearly broke her heart.

800
00:36:59.869 --> 00:37:02.263
I'm sorry.
Sh... she was married?

801
00:37:03.308 --> 00:37:04.309
Is that a problem?

802
00:37:04.787 --> 00:37:07.703
I mean. she just never told me.

803
00:37:08.138 --> 00:37:09.836
Well. you haven't been
exactly upfront with her.

804
00:37:09.923 --> 00:37:10.924
either. have you?

805
00:37:11.272 --> 00:37:13.361
It's okay.
I'm not judging her.

806
00:37:13.448 --> 00:37:15.407
It's just 29's a little young

807
00:37:15.537 --> 00:37:17.713
to already be married
and divorced. that's all.

808
00:37:18.236 --> 00:37:20.847
Hm. Is that how old
you think we are?

809
00:37:22.936 --> 00:37:24.198
How old are you?

810
00:37:26.374 --> 00:37:28.420
I'm not here
to spill Anna's secrets. Nick.

811
00:37:29.029 --> 00:37:30.552
Yeah. why are you here?

812
00:37:30.683 --> 00:37:31.510
Honestly...

813
00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.208
I don't know yet.

814
00:37:35.818 --> 00:37:37.777
At first. I thought I was just
gonna be able to tell you

815
00:37:37.864 --> 00:37:39.082
that you're such
an obvious fuckboy.

816
00:37:39.169 --> 00:37:40.475
and to leave my sister alone.

817
00:37:45.741 --> 00:37:47.308
But I'm a little intrigued
by you. Nick.

818
00:37:49.615 --> 00:37:52.835
Did you know that twins
are technically genetic clones?

819
00:37:53.967 --> 00:37:55.142
It's kinda freaky. right?

820
00:37:55.882 --> 00:37:58.319
I guess. yeah.
It's a little freaky.

821
00:37:58.624 --> 00:37:59.494
Are you?

822
00:38:00.626 --> 00:38:01.540
What?

823
00:38:04.282 --> 00:38:05.413
A little freaky?

824
00:38:13.029 --> 00:38:14.074
I'm going to my room.

825
00:38:15.118 --> 00:38:16.294
You're staying here?

826
00:38:16.642 --> 00:38:18.687
Yeah. Gig today paid cash.

827
00:38:19.514 --> 00:38:21.386
Someone hands me cash.
I blow it immediately.

828
00:38:22.169 --> 00:38:23.083
Can't help it.

829
00:38:23.431 --> 00:38:24.389
Don't even want to.

830
00:38:26.042 --> 00:38:27.435
Put this on room 101.

831
00:38:27.914 --> 00:38:29.698
No. come on.
Don't be silly. I got it.

832
00:38:30.612 --> 00:38:32.397
I've never needed a man
to buy me dinner. Nick.

833
00:38:33.267 --> 00:38:35.269
Please. finish your meal.

834
00:38:35.748 --> 00:38:36.966
have dessert. if you want.

835
00:38:37.793 --> 00:38:39.969
Don't forget to stop by
for a nightcap on your way out.

836
00:38:47.107 --> 00:38:48.500
What the fuck?

Guess again.

887
00:42:06.175 --> 00:42:08.090
Oh. fuck me.

888
00:42:08.482 --> 00:42:10.919
I gotta got to work.

889
00:42:11.267 --> 00:42:12.399
Oh. fuck.

890
00:42:12.486 --> 00:42:13.705
Fuck. fuck. fuck!

891
00:42:17.491 --> 00:42:19.058
Have a good day
at work. sweetie.

892
00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:21.364
Uh...

893
00:42:23.062 --> 00:42:23.976
bye.

894
00:42:53.266 --> 00:42:54.223
Hey. you.

895
00:42:54.441 --> 00:42:55.355
<i>Hey. you!</i>

896
00:42:55.921 --> 00:42:57.270
I was starting to get worried.
Did you get my texts?

897
00:42:57.618 --> 00:42:59.141
Yeah. I did. Sorry.

898
00:42:59.272 --> 00:43:01.666
Me and the guys
kind of overdid it last night.

899
00:43:01.796 --> 00:43:03.189
Oh. did you have fun?

900
00:43:03.363 --> 00:43:05.147
<i>That stuff's
getting kind of old.</i>

901
00:43:05.583 --> 00:43:07.759
You know. I'd...
rather be with you.

902
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:10.022
Well. maybe you should hang out
with your friends more often.

903
00:43:10.109 --> 00:43:11.458
You seem so cute
and vulnerable.

904
00:43:12.198 --> 00:43:13.591
I just miss you. that's all.

905
00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:15.723
Well. it just so happens

906
00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:17.203
that this catering company
I'm considering

907
00:43:17.333 --> 00:43:18.683
can squeeze in a tasting
this evening.

908
00:43:19.205 --> 00:43:20.162
You know...

909
00:43:21.033 --> 00:43:23.209
I'm actually not really
feeling that well.

910
00:43:24.253 --> 00:43:25.254
Hangover?

911
00:43:25.472 --> 00:43:27.082
I'm afraid it might be
a bit more than that.

912
00:43:27.169 --> 00:43:28.083
<i>Oh. baby!</i>

913
00:43:28.475 --> 00:43:29.824
Well. I'll just come over
and take care of you.

914
00:43:29.911 --> 00:43:31.304
<i>No. no. no. no.</i>

915
00:43:31.434 --> 00:43:32.479
I... I don't think so.

916
00:43:32.566 --> 00:43:33.915
I mean. the last thing
you need right now

917
00:43:34.002 --> 00:43:34.873
is a cold. right?

918
00:43:35.221 --> 00:43:37.527
You need to stay on top
of this wedding stuff.

919
00:43:37.615 --> 00:43:39.007
<i>You should go tonight.</i>

920
00:43:39.094 --> 00:43:40.182
But I wanna know what you think.

921
00:43:40.269 --> 00:43:41.183
<i>What I think is.</i>

922
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:43.055
I will love
whatever you pick.

923
00:43:43.185 --> 00:43:44.143
<i>Are you sure?</i>

924
00:43:45.013 --> 00:43:46.145
Yeah. I'm positive.

925
00:43:46.972 --> 00:43:47.973
Okay.

926
00:43:48.582 --> 00:43:49.888
but if I'm having
trouble deciding.

927
00:43:50.018 --> 00:43:50.889
I'm gonna FaceTime you.

928
00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:53.892
All right.
I'll be standing by.

929
00:43:54.370 --> 00:43:55.807
Oh. don't forget
to call your mom.

930
00:43:55.937 --> 00:43:57.896
I spoke to her today
and she seemed a little lonely.

931
00:43:59.506 --> 00:44:00.376
Right.

932
00:44:00.855 --> 00:44:01.769
I will.

933
00:44:02.074 --> 00:44:02.901
Love you.

934
00:44:03.205 --> 00:44:04.380
I love you too.

935
00:44:09.864 --> 00:44:11.561
<i>♪ Let's go do something crazy ♪</i>

936
00:44:14.129 --> 00:44:15.957
<i>♪ Let's go do something</i>

937
00:44:18.917 --> 00:44:21.136
<i>♪ Let's go do something crazy ♪</i>

938
00:44:21.267 --> 00:44:22.442
<i>♪ Crazy ♪</i>

939
00:44:23.748 --> 00:44:25.358
<i>♪ Let's go do something</i>

940
00:44:28.404 --> 00:44:29.362
Oh!

941
00:44:30.058 --> 00:44:31.146
Oh. my God.

942
00:44:35.673 --> 00:44:37.022
What the fuck are we doing?

943
00:44:38.806 --> 00:44:40.329
I don't know. You tell me.

944
00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:42.418
You called me.
You got the room this time.

945
00:44:42.941 --> 00:44:44.072
Oh. my God.

946
00:44:44.856 --> 00:44:47.554
I've just been kind of a mess.
Honestly.

947
00:44:47.641 --> 00:44:50.949
with my mom and everything
that's been going on lately...

948
00:44:51.253 --> 00:44:53.691
Nick...
don't ruin it by being needy.

949
00:44:53.778 --> 00:44:55.040
Save that shit for Anna.

950
00:45:00.436 --> 00:45:02.177
She can never find out
about this.

951
00:45:02.308 --> 00:45:04.049
I wasn't planning
on telling her.

952
00:45:04.136 --> 00:45:05.137
I'm serious. Zoe.

953
00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:07.095
This would kill her.

954
00:45:07.574 --> 00:45:08.618
Probably.

955
00:45:09.271 --> 00:45:10.533
Don't you care about her?

956
00:45:10.664 --> 00:45:12.274
Are you fucking kidding me?

957
00:45:12.884 --> 00:45:14.320
It's your cum between my legs.

958
00:45:14.494 --> 00:45:16.322
Which one of us
is the bad guy here. Nick?

959
00:45:16.452 --> 00:45:18.585
Oh. no. Hey.
I'm not trying to blame you.

960
00:45:20.195 --> 00:45:21.370
She's my sister.

961
00:45:21.457 --> 00:45:23.459
I'd murder somebody for her.
Would you?

962
00:45:25.548 --> 00:45:27.376
Would I murder someone for Anna?

963
00:45:29.596 --> 00:45:31.641
I mean. to save her life
or something.

964
00:45:31.729 --> 00:45:32.773
sure. of course.

965
00:45:33.426 --> 00:45:34.688
That's not murder. Nick.

966
00:45:35.341 --> 00:45:36.908
Doesn't sound
a lot like love. either.

967
00:45:44.916 --> 00:45:46.482
We can't do this anymore.

968
00:46:02.237 --> 00:46:03.282
All right.

969
00:46:09.027 --> 00:46:10.071
Thanks.

970
00:46:11.899 --> 00:46:13.161
Hi.

971
00:46:13.248 --> 00:46:14.162
Hey.

972
00:46:14.293 --> 00:46:15.947
Wow. Those are beautiful.

973
00:46:16.077 --> 00:46:17.905
- Aw. Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

974
00:46:18.863 --> 00:46:20.821
This was such a nice surprise.

975
00:46:21.039 --> 00:46:21.909
Uh-oh.

976
00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:23.258
Red roses?

977
00:46:23.781 --> 00:46:25.173
Could mean two things.

978
00:46:25.347 --> 00:46:27.697
it's Valentine's Day.
or a man screwed up.

979
00:46:29.438 --> 00:46:30.570
And it ain't Valentine's Day.

980
00:46:30.657 --> 00:46:32.006
Love the sunglasses!

981
00:46:32.093 --> 00:46:33.486
- Isn't she hilarious?
- Yeah.

982
00:46:33.573 --> 00:46:34.661
Vera. this is Nick.

983
00:46:34.748 --> 00:46:36.315
- Nick. this is Vera.
- Hi. Vera.

984
00:46:36.402 --> 00:46:38.143
You know you hit the lottery
with Anna here. right?

985
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:40.362
Oh. my goodness!
Absolutely. Yeah.

986
00:46:40.493 --> 00:46:43.452
Oh. um. your sister called
while you were at lunch.

987
00:46:44.192 --> 00:46:46.194
I can tell by your face
that she said something bad.

988
00:46:46.325 --> 00:46:48.283
Not bad. She wanted to know
if you were mad at her

989
00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:49.763
for not helping more
with the wedding.

990
00:46:50.242 --> 00:46:51.199
Oh.

991
00:46:51.591 --> 00:46:52.897
That's actually kind of sweet.

992
00:46:53.158 --> 00:46:54.855
Yeah. she told me
she's been too busy.

993
00:46:54.942 --> 00:46:55.856
in her words.

994
00:46:56.509 --> 00:46:58.076
"Smashing the hottest dude."

995
00:46:58.163 --> 00:47:00.905
- Oh. my God.
- Gave me lots of details.

996
00:47:00.992 --> 00:47:02.863
- I'm so sorry. Vera.
-Are you kidding me?

997
00:47:02.994 --> 00:47:05.039
It's the most fun
I've had all day.

998
00:47:05.953 --> 00:47:07.999
- Good meeting you.
- Yeah. it's great to meet you.

999
00:47:08.608 --> 00:47:10.001
Isn't she the best?

1000
00:47:10.088 --> 00:47:12.481
Yeah. she's funny.
- Aw!

1001
00:47:12.568 --> 00:47:13.569
<i>What do you think?</i>

1002
00:47:13.656 --> 00:47:14.832
Do you think
you can you fit it in?

1003
00:47:14.962 --> 00:47:16.529
- Huh?
- Nick.

1004
00:47:17.269 --> 00:47:18.183
Yeah?

1005
00:47:18.705 --> 00:47:20.359
Will Wednesday work
for the taste testing or not?

1006
00:47:20.925 --> 00:47:22.491
Oh. didn't you already do that?

1007
00:47:22.622 --> 00:47:24.276
That was for catering.
This is for the cake.

1008
00:47:25.016 --> 00:47:26.495
Are you even
listening to me at all?

1009
00:47:26.582 --> 00:47:28.497
Yeah. of course. Sorry.

1010
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:32.023
Hey. I wanna see your eyes.

1011
00:47:34.852 --> 00:47:36.549
Are you sure
there's nothing else?

1012
00:47:37.245 --> 00:47:41.075
I feel like we still never
talked about certain things.

1013
00:47:41.728 --> 00:47:42.860
Oh. like what?

1014
00:47:44.122 --> 00:47:45.514
Like significant exes.

1015
00:47:45.906 --> 00:47:46.776
Oh.

1016
00:47:47.038 --> 00:47:48.126
Well. I thought
that was just because

1017
00:47:48.213 --> 00:47:50.041
we're about the future.
not the past.

1018
00:47:50.171 --> 00:47:51.172
Right?

1019
00:47:51.651 --> 00:47:52.957
Yeah. but...

1020
00:47:56.395 --> 00:47:57.439
I was married.

1021
00:47:58.092 --> 00:47:59.050
Briefly.

1022
00:47:59.267 --> 00:48:00.268
You were?

1023
00:48:00.703 --> 00:48:02.575
Yeah. Um...

1024
00:48:03.228 --> 00:48:05.273
We broke up
because he slept with Zoe.

1025
00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:06.274
What?

1026
00:48:07.406 --> 00:48:08.798
Oh. fuck.

1027
00:48:10.191 --> 00:48:11.192
But you forgave her?

1028
00:48:11.932 --> 00:48:13.281
She was using at the time.

1029
00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:14.848
She was vulnerable.

1030
00:48:15.283 --> 00:48:16.589
and he took advantage of her.

1031
00:48:16.719 --> 00:48:17.895
He was the one
I couldn't forgive.

1032
00:48:19.897 --> 00:48:21.594
Uh. yeah.

1033
00:48:21.942 --> 00:48:22.987
Then I met you.

1034
00:48:23.683 --> 00:48:25.903
God. I'm so sorry. Come here.

1035
00:48:28.296 --> 00:48:29.732
Mm! Whoa. silly!

1036
00:48:29.863 --> 00:48:31.125
I work around here.

1037
00:48:31.821 --> 00:48:32.953
Save that for later.

1038
00:48:33.301 --> 00:48:34.781
Right. I'm sorry.

1039
00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:54.409
So are you
thinking something maybe

1040
00:48:54.496 --> 00:48:55.584
a little more this style.

1041
00:48:55.671 --> 00:48:57.673
ball gown. mermaid?

1042
00:48:57.804 --> 00:48:59.501
- Would you excuse me a moment?
-Mm-hmm.

1043
00:48:59.588 --> 00:49:00.459
Miss Mercer?

1044
00:49:00.546 --> 00:49:01.764
- Hi.
- Hi!

1045
00:49:01.851 --> 00:49:02.852
Can I call you Anna?

1046
00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:03.853
Yes. you can.

1047
00:49:03.941 --> 00:49:05.855
Yay! Anna. I'm Isabelle.

1048
00:49:06.334 --> 00:49:07.596
-Hi.
- First things first.

1049
00:49:07.683 --> 00:49:08.858
let me see your rock.

1050
00:49:09.424 --> 00:49:10.730
Oh. um...

1051
00:49:12.427 --> 00:49:13.733
Oh. my God. Anna.

1052
00:49:14.038 --> 00:49:16.301
Okay. I see a lot
of engagement rings.

1053
00:49:16.388 --> 00:49:18.781
but this is breathtaking.

1054
00:49:18.956 --> 00:49:19.826
Thank you.

1055
00:49:19.913 --> 00:49:21.349
Oh. it's too perfect!

1056
00:49:21.436 --> 00:49:22.307
When's the date?

1057
00:49:22.437 --> 00:49:23.351
August 19th.

1058
00:49:23.438 --> 00:49:26.398
Anna. you are so smart

1059
00:49:26.485 --> 00:49:28.356
to get a relatively early
start on things.

1060
00:49:28.487 --> 00:49:29.401
I mean.

1061
00:49:29.575 --> 00:49:31.011
you are gonna have
an entire year

1062
00:49:31.098 --> 00:49:32.273
- to make things perfect.
- Oh...

1063
00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:34.145
it's actually. uh. this August.

1064
00:49:34.362 --> 00:49:35.320
Of this year?

1065
00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:37.626
Yeah. Is that a problem?

1066
00:49:38.236 --> 00:49:40.412
So like. um...
...next month?

1067
00:49:41.195 --> 00:49:42.153
Uh-huh.

1068
00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.545
Oh. my God. Anna.

1069
00:49:43.719 --> 00:49:46.200
You can forget about
all of these gorgeous gowns.

1070
00:49:46.418 --> 00:49:48.115
The lead time on alterations

1071
00:49:48.246 --> 00:49:49.290
is eight months.

1072
00:49:49.856 --> 00:49:51.075
Didn't your friends warn you?

1073
00:49:53.947 --> 00:49:55.557
You don't have anything
that'll work for me?

1074
00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:59.170
I mean. you might be able
to fit into one of our samples.

1075
00:49:59.257 --> 00:50:01.172
but I can't promise anything.

1076
00:50:01.999 --> 00:50:02.956
Okay?

1077
00:50:10.398 --> 00:50:11.356
Lookin' good. sis.

1078
00:50:11.443 --> 00:50:12.487
You came!

1079
00:50:12.618 --> 00:50:13.880
You know I don't
turn down free fizz.

1080
00:50:15.316 --> 00:50:16.230
Do you like it?

1081
00:50:16.665 --> 00:50:19.929
It's... pretty.

1082
00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:22.149
I think it's gorgeous.

1083
00:50:22.845 --> 00:50:24.325
Makes me feel like a princess.

1084
00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:27.241
What's that?

1085
00:50:27.328 --> 00:50:28.503
My only other option.

1086
00:50:28.590 --> 00:50:30.331
I didn't realize
it takes these designers forever

1087
00:50:30.418 --> 00:50:31.463
to get a dress ready.

1088
00:50:31.811 --> 00:50:33.508
My apologies. Anna.

1089
00:50:33.595 --> 00:50:34.988
It's just the way
this business works.

1090
00:50:35.075 --> 00:50:36.250
I totally understand.

1091
00:50:36.946 --> 00:50:39.210
My God.
You look stunning. though!

1092
00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:41.125
I know just the veil for this.

1093
00:50:44.215 --> 00:50:45.346
You're gonna trip in that skirt.

1094
00:50:47.435 --> 00:50:48.436
Isabelle?

1095
00:50:48.871 --> 00:50:50.569
Do you think
the front is too long?

1096
00:50:50.873 --> 00:50:53.180
Luckily. that is something
we have time to alter.

1097
00:50:53.267 --> 00:50:54.877
We are going to make sure

1098
00:50:54.964 --> 00:50:57.402
that everything is perfect
for your big day.

1099
00:50:58.707 --> 00:50:59.621
Look at that.

1100
00:51:01.623 --> 00:51:02.537
Nothing like a veil

1101
00:51:02.885 --> 00:51:04.365
to hide a fragile woman
away from the world.

1102
00:51:05.366 --> 00:51:06.324
It's tradition.

1103
00:51:06.933 --> 00:51:08.021
It matters to me.

1104
00:51:08.282 --> 00:51:09.631
I think we may have
found your dress.

1105
00:51:09.762 --> 00:51:11.068
Anna--ANNA: We have.

1106
00:51:11.764 --> 00:51:12.982
Are you sure?

1107
00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:14.680
Because.
once we make alterations.

1108
00:51:14.767 --> 00:51:15.811
there are no returns.

1109
00:51:16.551 --> 00:51:17.509
I'm sure.

1110
00:51:18.292 --> 00:51:20.642
Oh. my God. Yay!
I'm so happy this worked!

1111
00:51:20.729 --> 00:51:22.383
Okay. I am going to go talk
to the seamstress.

1112
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:23.645
because we have
no time to waste.

1113
00:51:23.732 --> 00:51:24.603
Okay.

1114
00:51:27.475 --> 00:51:28.563
Have you even tried this on?

1115
00:51:28.650 --> 00:51:29.651
It's not really me.

1116
00:51:29.782 --> 00:51:30.783
Put it on.

1117
00:51:31.044 --> 00:51:33.133
Zoe.
it doesn't have a back.

1118
00:51:33.438 --> 00:51:34.787
I couldn't wear a bra.

1119
00:51:35.092 --> 00:51:36.832
I'd be noticed
for all the wrong reasons.

1120
00:51:37.094 --> 00:51:38.791
God forbid
people know you have tits.

1121
00:51:40.358 --> 00:51:42.969
God forbid
you're actually seen. Anna.

1122
00:51:43.665 --> 00:51:44.753
Please don't do this.

1123
00:51:46.059 --> 00:51:46.929
Please.

1124
00:51:47.408 --> 00:51:49.149
Can't you just be happy
for me. for once?

1125
00:51:50.194 --> 00:51:51.151
Fine.

1126
00:51:57.288 --> 00:51:58.941
Oh! Anna.

1127
00:51:59.159 --> 00:52:00.117
Nope.

1128
00:52:00.378 --> 00:52:01.770
- Huh?
- Not Anna.

1129
00:52:02.597 --> 00:52:03.685
You're the sister.

1130
00:52:03.859 --> 00:52:05.034
Hmm. you're quick!

1131
00:52:05.383 --> 00:52:06.384
Gonna invite me in?

1132
00:52:07.341 --> 00:52:08.212
Sure.

1133
00:52:08.386 --> 00:52:10.214
Oh. no. thanks.
Tight on time.

1134
00:52:10.562 --> 00:52:12.781
I'm gonna go see this guy
that I'm having an affair with.

1135
00:52:13.042 --> 00:52:15.610
I'm sure you've been there.
Right?

1136
00:52:15.871 --> 00:52:16.916
No.

1137
00:52:17.046 --> 00:52:19.179
Anyway. this isn't about me.

1138
00:52:19.962 --> 00:52:21.834
Why didn't you go
to the stupid dress thing?

1139
00:52:21.921 --> 00:52:23.009
I have a job.

1140
00:52:23.618 --> 00:52:25.359
and my mother's dying.
I don't know if you heard.

1141
00:52:25.446 --> 00:52:26.360
Mm.

1142
00:52:26.447 --> 00:52:27.579
Anna said it was no big deal.

1143
00:52:27.709 --> 00:52:29.058
Of course.
it's a big deal to her!

1144
00:52:29.711 --> 00:52:32.714
Combine every fairytale princess
with some psychotic monster.

1145
00:52:32.845 --> 00:52:33.802
and that's Anna.

1146
00:52:34.151 --> 00:52:36.109
I know her obsession
with happily-ever-after

1147
00:52:36.196 --> 00:52:37.066
is pathetic.

1148
00:52:37.632 --> 00:52:39.721
but you agreed to be
in the wedding. didn't you?

1149
00:52:40.809 --> 00:52:42.681
Yeah--ZOE: Well. then you're gonna go
to this dress fitting.

1150
00:52:42.768 --> 00:52:44.073
because I'm not going back.

1151
00:52:44.422 --> 00:52:45.684
The stupid bitch
at the dress shop

1152
00:52:45.771 --> 00:52:47.033
won't even look me in the eye.

1153
00:52:47.599 --> 00:52:49.557
so get over yourself

1154
00:52:50.471 --> 00:52:51.603
and do your part.

1155
00:52:53.953 --> 00:52:55.302
So lovely meeting you.

1156
00:52:55.607 --> 00:52:56.782
We're gonna be besties.

- Hmm?
- What do you think of the band?

1182
00:54:32.356 --> 00:54:33.313
Oh.

1183
00:54:33.835 --> 00:54:36.055
I mean. wouldn't it be easier
to just get a DJ?

1184
00:54:36.534 --> 00:54:37.665
We talked about this.

1185
00:54:38.057 --> 00:54:40.015
I really like
the energy of a live band.

1186
00:54:40.146 --> 00:54:42.409
I mean. Zoe might hook up
with the lead singer.

1187
00:54:42.714 --> 00:54:44.716
but everyone's supposed
to have fun at a wedding. right?

1188
00:54:45.107 --> 00:54:46.021
Yeah.

1189
00:54:46.761 --> 00:54:48.328
It's crazy
that you haven't met her.

1190
00:54:48.676 --> 00:54:50.678
We need to change that. Nick.
She's my sister.

1191
00:54:57.206 --> 00:54:59.339
So. your numbers
are way down. mate.

1192
00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:01.428
Probably not the best time
for Bob

1193
00:55:01.515 --> 00:55:02.516
or one of the old-timers

1194
00:55:02.951 --> 00:55:04.953
catching you banging away
in the elevator. you know?

1195
00:55:05.998 --> 00:55:06.999
You saw that?

1196
00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:09.044
Yeah. you weren't exactly
being discreet.

1197
00:55:10.785 --> 00:55:11.960
Hey. Anna winked at me.

1198
00:55:14.049 --> 00:55:16.008
<i>Rebecca.
I'm so glad that you came.</i>

1199
00:55:16.138 --> 00:55:17.879
I know that wedding dresses
aren't exactly your thing.

1200
00:55:17.966 --> 00:55:19.403
but I think
you're gonna love this one.

1201
00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:23.145
Isabelle. this is my soon-to-be
sister-in-law. Rebecca.

1202
00:55:23.581 --> 00:55:25.626
There's no coffee
allowed in here.

1203
00:55:25.887 --> 00:55:27.106
for obvious reasons.

1204
00:55:27.541 --> 00:55:29.369
especially considering
what happened last time.

1205
00:55:29.587 --> 00:55:30.631
Miss Mercer.

1206
00:55:31.153 --> 00:55:33.025
Last time? I don't understand.

1207
00:55:33.112 --> 00:55:34.113
I think you do.

1208
00:55:34.548 --> 00:55:36.507
As I'm sure you realize.
we're not going to be able

1209
00:55:36.594 --> 00:55:38.204
to make alterations
to the lace gown now.

1210
00:55:38.465 --> 00:55:40.511
- Why not?
- Are you kidding me?

1211
00:55:44.819 --> 00:55:45.864
It's ruined!

1212
00:55:47.169 --> 00:55:49.607
It... it looks like somebody
cut it on purpose.

1213
00:55:49.868 --> 00:55:51.870
It wasn't like that
when I tried it on.

1214
00:55:52.044 --> 00:55:53.088
You saw me in it.

1215
00:55:53.393 --> 00:55:55.917
I did. but I wasn't with you
when you took it off.

1216
00:55:56.048 --> 00:55:57.397
Y... you think that I did this?

1217
00:55:58.529 --> 00:55:59.965
Somebody must've
tried it on after me.

1218
00:56:00.095 --> 00:56:02.794
No. No. I brought it
right back here after you left.

1219
00:56:02.881 --> 00:56:04.665
We thought maybe you split it
when you took it off.

1220
00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:06.406
By accident. I mean.

1221
00:56:08.713 --> 00:56:09.844
Maybe that's what happened.

1222
00:56:11.193 --> 00:56:12.717
I'll pay for it. of course.

1223
00:56:13.065 --> 00:56:14.022
and. uh...

1224
00:56:15.284 --> 00:56:17.722
well. I'm gonna be needing
another dress. so. uh...

1225
00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:19.898
do you still have that backless
one that you showed me?

1226
00:56:20.594 --> 00:56:23.380
I do. Great!
I will go grab that for you.

1227
00:56:29.734 --> 00:56:30.691
Are you okay?

1228
00:56:31.605 --> 00:56:32.650
Oh. I'm fine.

1229
00:56:33.128 --> 00:56:34.303
Yeah. um...

1230
00:56:34.695 --> 00:56:36.349
the other one is stunning too.

1231
00:56:38.177 --> 00:56:39.744
It's the one
that Zoe wanted me to get.

1232
00:57:00.895 --> 00:57:01.809
<i>Hello?</i>

1233
00:57:08.816 --> 00:57:09.730
Alexia? Is that you?

1234
00:57:14.387 --> 00:57:16.128
Hey. I thought
I heard someone in here.

1235
00:57:17.042 --> 00:57:17.912
You okay?

1236
00:57:22.177 --> 00:57:24.397
All I ever wrote about
in my diaries was Zoe.

1237
00:57:26.834 --> 00:57:28.532
It's like I didn't even exist
without her.

1238
00:57:30.011 --> 00:57:31.099
I'm... I'm worried

1239
00:57:31.317 --> 00:57:33.145
that this wedding is causing you
too much stress.

1240
00:57:33.275 --> 00:57:35.103
Dad. I'm serious. don't.

1241
00:57:35.843 --> 00:57:37.018
It's not the wedding.

1242
00:57:38.237 --> 00:57:39.847
Nick is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

1243
00:57:39.934 --> 00:57:40.935
No. I'm sure he is.

1244
00:57:41.283 --> 00:57:42.937
It's not the wedding. It's Zoe.

1245
00:57:45.026 --> 00:57:47.028
I love her so much.
you know that.

1246
00:57:47.115 --> 00:57:48.203
That'll never change.

1247
00:57:50.771 --> 00:57:52.077
But I think it's finally
time for me

1248
00:57:52.164 --> 00:57:53.644
to come out
from under her shadow.

1249
00:57:55.863 --> 00:57:56.821
Really?

1250
00:57:57.082 --> 00:57:58.039
Yeah.

1251
00:58:00.346 --> 00:58:01.782
Come here. baby. Come here.

1252
00:58:02.522 --> 00:58:04.306
That's really great.

1253
00:58:04.393 --> 00:58:05.830
That's really.
really great. honey.

1254
00:58:13.838 --> 00:58:15.274
Ice cream and rom-coms?

1255
00:58:16.188 --> 00:58:17.929
Can you be
any more of a cliché. Anna?

1256
00:58:20.758 --> 00:58:21.715
Why'd you do it?

1257
00:58:23.978 --> 00:58:25.023
I did you a favor.

1258
00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:27.547
You'll look hot
in the skimpy dress.

1259
00:58:28.679 --> 00:58:29.897
I was just trying to help you.

1260
00:58:30.768 --> 00:58:31.943
That's what I always do.

1261
00:58:32.639 --> 00:58:33.945
That's what you tell yourself.

1262
00:58:35.163 --> 00:58:37.731
but you just use it
as an excuse to be cruel to me.

1263
00:58:38.645 --> 00:58:39.864
even though I love you

1264
00:58:40.125 --> 00:58:41.909
more than
anyone else in the world.

1265
00:58:42.431 --> 00:58:45.043
Maybe because I love you more
than anyone else in the world.

1266
00:58:47.741 --> 00:58:49.526
Nothing more boring
than amateur therapy.

1267
00:58:52.267 --> 00:58:53.355
I'll be in my room...

1268
00:58:54.052 --> 00:58:55.096
masturbating.

1269
00:58:55.967 --> 00:58:57.142
It's not working anymore.

1270
00:58:58.230 --> 00:59:00.624
all those things that you say
to make me feel uncomfortable.

1271
00:59:01.102 --> 00:59:02.800
I'm starting to not care. Zoe.

1272
00:59:05.846 --> 00:59:07.413
I don't even care
if you come to the wedding.

1273
00:59:08.632 --> 00:59:09.546
Maybe I won't.

1274
00:59:41.316 --> 00:59:42.535
Jesus!

1275
01:00:12.478 --> 01:00:13.740
I didn't know you smoked.

1276
01:00:15.481 --> 01:00:16.613
Oral fixation.

1277
01:00:17.439 --> 01:00:18.397
No. thank you.

1278
01:00:22.227 --> 01:00:24.403
Talked to Anna
about her last marriage.

1279
01:00:25.796 --> 01:00:29.408
She said that you were
the cause of the breakup.

1280
01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:31.715
His dishonesty was the cause.

1281
01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:33.630
He failed the test.

1282
01:00:38.025 --> 01:00:39.505
Is that what all this has been?

1283
01:00:41.333 --> 01:00:42.639
A test that I've failed?

1284
01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:46.251
Yeah.

1285
01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:51.343
But I fuckin' love you.

1286
01:00:55.173 --> 01:00:56.087
You love me?

1287
01:00:57.697 --> 01:00:59.568
I mean. I love fucking you.

1288
01:01:00.308 --> 01:01:01.309
Don't be weird.

1289
01:01:07.881 --> 01:01:09.361
We could go away right now...

1290
01:01:10.884 --> 01:01:11.885
just disappear.

1291
01:01:14.366 --> 01:01:15.628
Zoe...

1292
01:01:16.585 --> 01:01:19.023
Are you just... are you just
fucking messing with me?

1293
01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:23.723
Or are you asking me to choose
between you and Anna?

1294
01:01:24.115 --> 01:01:26.813
You know you have to. eventually.

1295
01:01:35.082 --> 01:01:36.867
Do you want me
to choose for you?

1296
01:01:38.607 --> 01:01:40.044
I could walk away right now.

1297
01:01:40.914 --> 01:01:42.916
or I could tell her.
and she'd fucking run away.

1298
01:01:47.007 --> 01:01:48.313
Do you want me to end it?

1299
01:01:54.232 --> 01:01:55.712
Fucking pathetic.

1300
01:02:17.211 --> 01:02:19.692
<i>A mother should be
the most important person</i>

1301
01:02:19.866 --> 01:02:21.520
<i>in the world to a baby.</i>

1302
01:02:24.392 --> 01:02:25.393
I wasn't.

1303
01:02:27.831 --> 01:02:29.093
They needed each other

1304
01:02:29.484 --> 01:02:30.572
more than anyone...

1305
01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:32.749
more than anything.

1306
01:02:34.228 --> 01:02:35.882
The only way
they could have been closer

1307
01:02:36.013 --> 01:02:37.492
is if they were conjoined.

1308
01:02:40.582 --> 01:02:42.715
Zoe was always
a little bit more like me.

1309
01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:45.283
impulsive and a little wild.

1310
01:02:45.587 --> 01:02:47.938
Of course my own rebellion
was small fry

1311
01:02:48.025 --> 01:02:48.982
in comparison.

1312
01:02:49.635 --> 01:02:52.507
but Anna was always
Daddy's little girl.

1313
01:02:53.378 --> 01:02:55.380
The world sometimes
seemed too tough for her.

1314
01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:56.424
I can't tell you

1315
01:02:57.077 --> 01:02:59.079
how many times she's fallen
for some womanizing bastard.

1316
01:02:59.210 --> 01:03:01.865
She puts up with their nonsense.
Sometimes. she even expects it!

1317
01:03:02.691 --> 01:03:03.605
Hello.

1318
01:03:03.823 --> 01:03:05.129
- Hi.
-Hi. David.

1319
01:03:05.216 --> 01:03:06.608
This is Rebecca. Nick's sister.

1320
01:03:07.305 --> 01:03:08.175
Oh.

1321
01:03:08.393 --> 01:03:09.307
Hi.

1322
01:03:09.655 --> 01:03:11.352
Oh. hi. hi.
Nice to meet you. Rebecca. Hi.

1323
01:03:12.005 --> 01:03:13.528
Uh. everything all right?

1324
01:03:13.659 --> 01:03:15.879
Yes. David. People...
people visit each other.

1325
01:03:16.662 --> 01:03:18.098
Rebecca just wanted to meet us

1326
01:03:18.185 --> 01:03:19.796
and... and hear some old stories
about Anna.

1327
01:03:20.318 --> 01:03:21.841
Ah. okay. I see.

1328
01:03:22.146 --> 01:03:23.495
I see. I see.

1329
01:03:24.496 --> 01:03:25.932
Okay. Well. I... I actually

1330
01:03:26.019 --> 01:03:27.412
have a few stories
that I'd like to share.

1331
01:03:27.499 --> 01:03:29.022
I don't think
there's anything more

1332
01:03:29.109 --> 01:03:30.502
you could possibly add. I mean.

1333
01:03:30.632 --> 01:03:32.547
I've just been
talking your ear off.

1334
01:03:32.678 --> 01:03:33.592
I'm so sorry.

1335
01:03:34.723 --> 01:03:35.681
Okay. well. maybe then

1336
01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:37.074
we can speak
for just a few moments

1337
01:03:37.161 --> 01:03:38.771
before you leave?
Is that all right. Rebecca?

1338
01:03:38.902 --> 01:03:40.468
- Sure.
-Okay. great.

1339
01:03:53.046 --> 01:03:54.352
Is there something wrong?

1340
01:03:56.441 --> 01:03:57.398
Alexia?

1341
01:03:57.485 --> 01:03:58.878
It's not Zoe's fault.

1342
01:03:59.748 --> 01:04:01.185
What's not Zoe's fault?

1343
01:04:02.186 --> 01:04:03.709
You know. this...
this whole thing.

1344
01:04:03.796 --> 01:04:05.276
with Zoe and your brother.

1345
01:05:01.506 --> 01:05:02.594
Oh. Rebecca?

1346
01:05:03.334 --> 01:05:04.291
Is everything okay?

1347
01:05:04.422 --> 01:05:05.423
We need to talk.

1348
01:05:21.874 --> 01:05:22.788
Hey. Anna.

1349
01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:25.008
<i>I know everything!</i>

1350
01:05:28.446 --> 01:05:29.664
Anna. listen to me. I'm gonna...

1351
01:05:29.751 --> 01:05:31.057
I'm gonna come
talk to you. okay?

1352
01:05:31.144 --> 01:05:32.929
<i>I don't wanna
see you ever again!</i>

1353
01:05:33.016 --> 01:05:35.061
No. baby. hey.
I... I... I can explain this.

1354
01:05:35.192 --> 01:05:36.758
Okay. I can--

1355
01:05:36.889 --> 01:05:37.803
Anna?

1356
01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:41.938
Anna? Anna. Anna!

1357
01:05:43.722 --> 01:05:44.853
You okay. mate?

1358
01:05:45.506 --> 01:05:46.855
- Fuck. man! I'm a fucking idiot.
-Are you okay?
What happened?

1359
01:05:46.855 --> 01:05:48.509
No. no. Are you k--

1360
01:05:48.727 --> 01:05:50.729
Pick up the phone.

1361
01:05:50.903 --> 01:05:52.774
<i>It's Zoe.
No rambling.</i>

1362
01:05:59.433 --> 01:06:00.478
What happened?

1363
01:06:00.608 --> 01:06:01.870
I fucked up. man!

1364
01:06:02.610 --> 01:06:03.916
What the fuck
have I been thinking?

1365
01:06:04.177 --> 01:06:05.222
I can't let her go. man.

1366
01:06:05.657 --> 01:06:06.919
I have to get over there.

1367
01:06:07.441 --> 01:06:08.921
<i>You've reached Anna Mercer.</i>

1368
01:06:09.052 --> 01:06:10.183
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

1369
01:06:14.796 --> 01:06:15.710
<i>You've reached Anna Mercer.</i>

1370
01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:16.755
<i>Please leave a--</i> Fuck!

1371
01:06:26.504 --> 01:06:27.548
Anna?

1372
01:06:33.467 --> 01:06:34.468
Anna?

1373
01:06:38.559 --> 01:06:39.517
Anna?

1374
01:06:46.785 --> 01:06:47.742
Anna?

1375
01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:49.005
Oh...

1376
01:06:50.484 --> 01:06:51.442
Oh!

1377
01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:55.011
Anna?

1378
01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:56.490
Oh. my God.

1379
01:06:56.577 --> 01:06:58.405
Anna? Anna. baby.

1380
01:06:58.579 --> 01:06:59.841
Anna? Anna!

1381
01:07:00.581 --> 01:07:01.800
Oh. my God. Oh. my God.

1382
01:07:01.930 --> 01:07:03.715
Help! Somebody. help me!

1383
01:07:27.521 --> 01:07:30.046
Anna... Anna!

1384
01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:31.786
Anna. Oh...

1385
01:07:32.309 --> 01:07:33.701
Anna.  Oh.

1386
01:07:33.788 --> 01:07:34.876
Enough. Nick.

1387
01:07:37.096 --> 01:07:38.315
I don't wanna have
to use this again.

1388
01:07:38.402 --> 01:07:40.012
but I will.
if you don't shut the fuck up.

1389
01:07:40.404 --> 01:07:41.535
What have you done?

1390
01:07:41.927 --> 01:07:43.363
What the fuck have you done?

1391
01:07:43.450 --> 01:07:44.625
You wanted me to end it.

1392
01:07:44.756 --> 01:07:45.800
No. No!

1393
01:07:46.105 --> 01:07:47.802
You said you wanted me
to choose for you. Nick.

1394
01:07:47.889 --> 01:07:49.587
No. No. no. no. no!

1395
01:07:50.109 --> 01:07:51.676
No!

1396
01:07:52.285 --> 01:07:53.156
Over.

1397
01:07:55.201 --> 01:07:56.376
That's what you said to me.

1398
01:07:56.942 --> 01:07:58.465
You wanted it over.

1399
01:07:59.510 --> 01:08:01.294
Honestly.
when I told her about us.

1400
01:08:01.381 --> 01:08:03.035
I thought she might
save us the effort...

1401
01:08:04.558 --> 01:08:05.646
but she put up a fight.

1402
01:08:07.692 --> 01:08:08.649
It's sad.

1403
01:08:09.041 --> 01:08:10.434
How could you do this to her?

1404
01:08:11.217 --> 01:08:12.436
How could you do this?

1405
01:08:12.566 --> 01:08:13.959
You broke her heart. Nick.

1406
01:08:15.221 --> 01:08:16.396
She was too good
for this world.

1407
01:08:16.483 --> 01:08:17.658
We both know that.

1408
01:08:18.964 --> 01:08:19.878
This?

1409
01:08:20.705 --> 01:08:21.880
It was mercy.

1410
01:08:22.576 --> 01:08:23.577
You're insane!

1411
01:08:24.274 --> 01:08:25.710
Don't call me that.

1412
01:08:26.798 --> 01:08:28.060
I don't like it.

1413
01:08:28.365 --> 01:08:30.193
Stay the fuck away from me.
Stay the fuck away from me!

1414
01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:31.324
We're in this together. Nick.

1415
01:08:31.411 --> 01:08:32.586
No. we're fucking not!

1416
01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:34.327
I'm calling the police.

1417
01:08:34.414 --> 01:08:35.415
You sure you wanna do that?

1418
01:08:35.546 --> 01:08:36.503
Yes.

1419
01:08:37.156 --> 01:08:39.071
Even though your fingerprints
are on the knife

1420
01:08:39.202 --> 01:08:40.420
that stabbed your fiancée?

1421
01:08:40.551 --> 01:08:41.465
Fuck you!

1422
01:08:41.552 --> 01:08:42.553
No. they're not.

1423
01:08:43.162 --> 01:08:44.250
Yeah. they are. Nick.

1424
01:08:44.816 --> 01:08:46.731
It was easy enough to do
when you were unconscious.

1425
01:08:47.732 --> 01:08:48.907
I have it somewhere safe.

1426
01:08:49.168 --> 01:08:50.126
Just in case.

1427
01:08:54.739 --> 01:08:56.175
Look at your sleeves. Nick.

1428
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:59.135
That's her blood.

1429
01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:03.661
I took the liberty
of scratching you

1430
01:09:03.748 --> 01:09:05.053
with her fingernails.

1431
01:09:06.968 --> 01:09:08.144
Can't argue with DNA. Nick.

1432
01:09:17.283 --> 01:09:19.242
I knew it was wrong. Officer!

1433
01:09:22.027 --> 01:09:23.289
But I loved him.

1434
01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:25.465
I tried to break it off.

1435
01:09:25.552 --> 01:09:26.640
I did! I tried.

1436
01:09:27.815 --> 01:09:30.122
I had to tell Anna.
I just couldn't do it anymore.

1437
01:09:30.209 --> 01:09:32.342
I told her.
and then he went crazy!

1438
01:09:32.733 --> 01:09:34.082
He stabbed her.

1439
01:09:34.474 --> 01:09:36.824
He stabbed her
- right in front of me!
- Stop.

1440
01:09:36.911 --> 01:09:38.478
Oh. my sweet sister!

1441
01:09:39.262 --> 01:09:40.741
It's my fault!

1442
01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:49.881
I loved Anna...

1443
01:09:51.578 --> 01:09:53.145
more than anyone else
in the world...

1444
01:09:58.542 --> 01:10:00.108
but I gave her up. Nick.

1445
01:10:05.853 --> 01:10:06.767
For us.

1446
01:10:10.597 --> 01:10:12.338
You know that she could
never satisfy you

1447
01:10:12.425 --> 01:10:13.383
the way that I can.

1448
01:10:15.994 --> 01:10:17.387
We're meant to be together.

1449
01:10:32.097 --> 01:10:33.272
Here. baby.

1450
01:10:48.766 --> 01:10:50.550
<i>I have it
all figured out. Nick.</i>

1451
01:10:54.815 --> 01:10:56.164
<i>There's a building
on the east side</i>

1452
01:10:56.252 --> 01:10:57.601
<i>that has an incinerator.</i>

1453
01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:00.821
<i>You can pull up to it
right through the garage.</i>

1454
01:11:01.387 --> 01:11:02.345
<i>I know the code.</i>

1455
01:11:03.041 --> 01:11:03.911
<i>How?</i>

1456
01:11:04.999 --> 01:11:06.653
I used to fuck the security guy.

1457
01:11:08.133 --> 01:11:09.308
<i>He had great pecs.</i>

1458
01:11:10.178 --> 01:11:11.397
<i>There's no cameras.</i>

1459
01:11:11.832 --> 01:11:13.660
<i>Wouldn't be the first time
someone used this place</i>

1460
01:11:13.747 --> 01:11:15.096
<i>to make a problem disappear.</i>

1461
01:11:15.401 --> 01:11:16.272
<i>Problem?</i>

1462
01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:18.535
It's Anna.

1463
01:11:21.668 --> 01:11:22.800
Not anymore. Nick.

1464
01:11:23.757 --> 01:11:24.628
<i>She's gone.</i>

1465
01:11:25.193 --> 01:11:26.325
<i>I need you to focus.</i>

1466
01:11:27.108 --> 01:11:29.807
<i>Don't stop anywhere else.
no matter what.</i>

1467
01:11:30.155 --> 01:11:31.548
<i>We don't need you being seen.</i>

1468
01:11:32.505 --> 01:11:34.942
<i>Tomorrow. this is just gonna
seem like a really bad dream.</i>

1469
01:11:36.248 --> 01:11:37.162
<i>I promise.</i>

1470
01:11:42.472 --> 01:11:43.908
<i>I can't do this!</i>

1471
01:11:44.474 --> 01:11:45.431
<i>Yes. you can.</i>

1472
01:11:47.912 --> 01:11:49.696
<i>Think about
your poor mother dying</i>

1473
01:11:50.044 --> 01:11:51.219
<i>while you rot in prison</i>

1474
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:53.309
<i>for murdering sweet. sweet Anna.</i>

1475
01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:10.108
<i>You and I
are connected. Nick...</i>

1476
01:12:12.589 --> 01:12:14.286
<i>more than you and Anna
ever were.</i>

1477
01:13:43.375 --> 01:13:44.637
Hey. sleepyhead.

1478
01:13:45.464 --> 01:13:46.509
Come and eat.

1479
01:13:46.813 --> 01:13:47.901
You must be starving.

1480
01:14:17.931 --> 01:14:19.106
Will you start eating already?

1481
01:14:19.367 --> 01:14:20.847
You're making me
feel self-conscious.

1482
01:14:24.677 --> 01:14:25.852
So. I was thinking.

1483
01:14:26.244 --> 01:14:27.288
Would it be too much

1484
01:14:27.506 --> 01:14:29.160
to serve heart-shaped pancakes
at the wedding?

1485
01:14:32.206 --> 01:14:33.294
The wedding?

1486
01:14:37.037 --> 01:14:38.648
I mean. it is sort of our thing.

1487
01:14:58.929 --> 01:15:00.496
I mean. it is sort of our thing.

1488
01:15:00.713 --> 01:15:01.801
You broke her heart. Nick.

1489
01:16:24.318 --> 01:16:26.320
Nick? Hey.

1490
01:16:28.235 --> 01:16:29.759
Is ever... is everything okay?

1491
01:16:30.803 --> 01:16:31.935
Um. no. sir.

1492
01:16:33.066 --> 01:16:33.980
No. um...

1493
01:16:35.025 --> 01:16:36.200
nothing's okay.

1494
01:16:37.505 --> 01:16:39.420
Um. come... come with me.

1495
01:16:44.382 --> 01:16:46.123
Yeah. Let's just go
into the office.

1496
01:16:51.868 --> 01:16:53.696
All right. have...
have a seat over here.

1497
01:16:57.003 --> 01:16:57.917
Here.

1498
01:17:05.751 --> 01:17:06.839
Here you go. Nick. Here.

1499
01:17:08.624 --> 01:17:09.625
Yeah?

1500
01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:11.801
Um...

1501
01:17:15.369 --> 01:17:16.893
I'm sorry.

1502
01:17:17.241 --> 01:17:18.111
What is it?

1503
01:17:20.592 --> 01:17:21.637
Your daughter's dead.

1504
01:17:22.246 --> 01:17:23.203
No. no.

1505
01:17:23.943 --> 01:17:26.163
Anna? No! How? No.

1506
01:17:26.250 --> 01:17:27.555
I'm not even sure
which one of 'em--

1507
01:17:27.643 --> 01:17:29.209
No. What happened?
What happened?

1508
01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:30.210
Tell me what happened.

1509
01:17:30.297 --> 01:17:31.559
Zoe killed Anna.

1510
01:17:32.169 --> 01:17:34.519
- What are you talking about?
- Or maybe it was Anna
who killed Zoe.

1511
01:17:34.606 --> 01:17:35.651
- No. What? No.
- It sounds crazy.

1512
01:17:35.781 --> 01:17:37.435
All I know
is that one of them's dead.

1513
01:17:39.045 --> 01:17:40.264
It's my fault. I was...

1514
01:17:42.962 --> 01:17:44.790
I was having an affair
with Zoe...

1515
01:17:46.574 --> 01:17:48.925
and I... I know
there's no excuse.

1516
01:17:49.012 --> 01:17:50.491
I'm going to the police.
but I just--

1517
01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:52.363
I needed to tell you first.

1518
01:17:53.059 --> 01:17:54.495
I'm so. so sorry.

1519
01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:57.673
Oh. my God. All right. Nick.
I. um...

1520
01:17:58.935 --> 01:18:00.501
now. I don't exactly know
what happened here.

1521
01:18:00.588 --> 01:18:02.329
but I... I think I understand.

1522
01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:04.767
What?

1523
01:18:05.463 --> 01:18:06.377
Zoe...

1524
01:18:07.291 --> 01:18:09.336
Zoe died three years ago.

1525
01:18:14.211 --> 01:18:15.168
No.

1526
01:18:15.255 --> 01:18:16.169
She did. Nick.

1527
01:18:16.735 --> 01:18:19.346
She... she stabbed herself
after a very bad breakup.

1528
01:18:19.695 --> 01:18:22.480
The girl had-- She had a flair
for the dramatic. okay?

1529
01:18:22.567 --> 01:18:23.960
All the way to the bitter end.

1530
01:18:24.482 --> 01:18:26.789
And Anna? Anna was the one
who found her.

1531
01:18:27.615 --> 01:18:29.095
<i>Just like Zoe intended.</i>

1532
01:19:00.170 --> 01:19:01.214
<i>They call it</i>

1533
01:19:01.345 --> 01:19:03.608
<i>"suicide
as aggressive retaliation."</i>

1534
01:19:05.305 --> 01:19:06.219
No.

1535
01:19:06.654 --> 01:19:08.178
Retaliation for what.
I have no fucking idea.

1536
01:19:08.265 --> 01:19:09.135
because Anna was...

1537
01:19:09.353 --> 01:19:11.094
was completely devoted
to her sister.

1538
01:19:11.181 --> 01:19:12.486
She... she would've
done anything for her.

1539
01:19:12.573 --> 01:19:15.402
No. No. I don't...
I don't believe you.

1540
01:19:15.489 --> 01:19:17.230
Unfortunately.
it's not just my truth.

1541
01:19:17.361 --> 01:19:19.406
- It's the truth.
- No. it's not the truth. okay?

1542
01:19:19.537 --> 01:19:20.538
I know Zoe!

1543
01:19:20.756 --> 01:19:23.323
What you're saying.
it's... it's impossible.

1544
01:19:23.802 --> 01:19:26.326
A little. uh. over I'd say
about two years ago.

1545
01:19:27.197 --> 01:19:28.764
I asked the police for...

1546
01:19:30.243 --> 01:19:32.332
a copy of this...
of this photo right here.

1547
01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:38.774
Okay?

1548
01:19:40.297 --> 01:19:41.777
Now. having the... the photo

1549
01:19:41.864 --> 01:19:43.996
of your child's body
in your own desk.

1550
01:19:44.257 --> 01:19:46.085
let me tell you something.
it... it weighs on you. Nick.

1551
01:19:46.172 --> 01:19:47.347
I mean. how could it not?

1552
01:19:47.565 --> 01:19:50.698
But having it. it's become
a grim necessity for me.

1553
01:19:50.786 --> 01:19:52.352
because any time
that... that Anna--

1554
01:19:52.483 --> 01:19:54.311
that she'd become Zoe around me.

1555
01:19:54.702 --> 01:19:56.835
I'd take it out.
I'd show it to her.

1556
01:19:56.966 --> 01:19:59.272
It would be brutal.
but it would do the trick.

1557
01:19:59.403 --> 01:20:01.231
She'd stop. okay?
At least around me.

1558
01:20:01.318 --> 01:20:03.581
Alexia. unfortunately.
still indulges her.

1559
01:20:04.974 --> 01:20:07.150
What do you mean.
"Anna would become Zoe"?

1560
01:20:07.454 --> 01:20:09.630
I mean exactly that.

1561
01:20:11.415 --> 01:20:12.416
It's weak.

1562
01:20:12.808 --> 01:20:14.157
<i>You should know yourself
better than anyone.</i>

1563
01:20:14.287 --> 01:20:15.158
<i>You just met him.</i>

1564
01:20:15.245 --> 01:20:16.376
I mean. what the fuck. Anna?

1565
01:20:17.943 --> 01:20:18.857
I can't--

1566
01:20:19.379 --> 01:20:22.252
Anna. she couldn't--
she wouldn't let Zoe stay dead.

1567
01:20:22.382 --> 01:20:24.689
Nick. and--
and it all started simply.

1568
01:20:24.776 --> 01:20:26.082
okay--Stop. stop!

1569
01:20:26.169 --> 01:20:28.127
She wanted to sleep
in Zoe's bed. yes.

1570
01:20:28.214 --> 01:20:29.781
She wanted to drive her car

1571
01:20:29.868 --> 01:20:32.262
<i>and wear her clothes. Okay?
She even bought this dress.</i>

1572
01:20:32.349 --> 01:20:33.567
this one here. that...

1573
01:20:33.698 --> 01:20:35.482
<i>that Zoe
killed herself in. okay?</i>

1574
01:20:35.656 --> 01:20:37.049
<i>And then she started talking</i>

1575
01:20:37.136 --> 01:20:38.007
to Zoe.

1576
01:20:38.137 --> 01:20:39.269
It's not really me.

1577
01:20:39.486 --> 01:20:40.836
Zoe. there's no back.

1578
01:20:40.966 --> 01:20:42.228
I couldn't wear a bra.

1579
01:20:42.315 --> 01:20:43.969
I'd be noticed
for all the wrong reasons.

1580
01:20:44.056 --> 01:20:46.145
It wasn't until
she started talking as Zoe.

1581
01:20:46.232 --> 01:20:48.408
that's when I realized
how unhealthy she'd become.

1582
01:20:48.669 --> 01:20:50.149
You're friends
with the fucking pigeons.

1583
01:20:50.236 --> 01:20:51.847
and you're looking at me
like I'm the asshole?

1584
01:20:52.848 --> 01:20:53.805
I'm so sorry.

1585
01:20:54.284 --> 01:20:55.894
She's not normally like that.
Your pigeons are adorable.

1586
01:20:56.025 --> 01:20:56.895
<i>By then--</i>

1587
01:20:57.243 --> 01:20:58.592
What are you...
What are you trying to say?

1588
01:20:58.679 --> 01:21:00.333
She's... she's schizophrenic?

1589
01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:02.770
No. I... I'm saying she's still
grieving. Nick. okay?

1590
01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:03.989
I'm not sure
if the label matters.

1591
01:21:04.076 --> 01:21:05.382
No. no. no. No. man!

1592
01:21:05.512 --> 01:21:07.384
It's more than that.
what she's done. it's vicious!

1593
01:21:07.471 --> 01:21:08.733
Unless I'm misunderstanding.

1594
01:21:09.038 --> 01:21:10.866
you thought you were cheating
on your fiancée

1595
01:21:10.953 --> 01:21:12.041
with her sister. right?

1596
01:21:12.258 --> 01:21:14.130
David. why? Why...
why didn't you tell me this?

1597
01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:17.002
I genuinely hoped
that... that your relationship.

1598
01:21:17.089 --> 01:21:18.786
that it would snap her
out of all of this

1599
01:21:18.874 --> 01:21:19.962
and then put--Yeah. but it didn't.

1600
01:21:20.049 --> 01:21:21.572
and now your daughter
has murdered someone!

1601
01:21:21.659 --> 01:21:23.574
- No. she hasn't. Nick.
-I walked in

1602
01:21:24.096 --> 01:21:26.707
to this same thing.
She recreated it exactly.

1603
01:21:26.969 --> 01:21:28.448
<i>then someone hit me from behind
and knocked me out.</i>

1604
01:21:28.535 --> 01:21:30.102
Help! Somebody. help me!

1605
01:21:30.233 --> 01:21:31.234
Oh!

1606
01:21:31.321 --> 01:21:32.278
<i>When I came to.</i>

1607
01:21:32.452 --> 01:21:34.541
there was a body
rolled up in the rug.

1608
01:21:34.672 --> 01:21:36.108
<i>I thought that it was Anna's.</i>

1609
01:21:36.195 --> 01:21:37.327
Nick. she... she tricked you.

1610
01:21:37.414 --> 01:21:39.242
Okay. But there's
still a real body!

1611
01:21:39.372 --> 01:21:41.505
- How do you know that?
- Because I held the hand!

1612
01:21:41.635 --> 01:21:43.550
Maybe that was... that was
a friend who's in on the prank.

1613
01:21:43.637 --> 01:21:45.422
probably the same person
who knocked you out.

1614
01:21:45.509 --> 01:21:46.423
Oh!

1615
01:21:49.382 --> 01:21:50.383
It's okay. Ivan.

1616
01:21:51.863 --> 01:21:53.125
He's a very bad man.

1617
01:21:53.909 --> 01:21:55.388
We're just teaching him
a lesson.

1618
01:21:55.780 --> 01:21:56.955
Whoever it was is dead!

1619
01:21:57.521 --> 01:21:59.871
- How can you be sure of that?
- Because I dumped
the fucking body!

1620
01:22:00.002 --> 01:22:01.351
She's duped us all
at any one point--

1621
01:22:01.438 --> 01:22:04.310
David. I dumped her body
into an incinerator.

1622
01:22:05.311 --> 01:22:06.922
<i>Okay? I know it's insane.</i>

1623
01:22:07.009 --> 01:22:08.532
I still can't believe
that I did it.

1624
01:22:08.662 --> 01:22:11.361
but I... I did it. and now s...

1625
01:22:12.362 --> 01:22:13.493
someone is dead.

1626
01:22:22.372 --> 01:22:23.677
Jesus Christ.

1627
01:22:29.118 --> 01:22:30.380
I guess... I guess your sister.

1628
01:22:30.467 --> 01:22:31.990
I guess... I guess
she had every right

1629
01:22:32.077 --> 01:22:33.383
- to be worried about you.
-What?

1630
01:22:35.559 --> 01:22:36.516
My sister?

1631
01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:39.302
Yeah. sh... she came here.
yesterday.

1632
01:22:40.129 --> 01:22:42.000
and Alexia wasn't
straightforward with her.

1633
01:22:42.131 --> 01:22:43.306
but I told her everything.

1634
01:22:43.393 --> 01:22:44.524
I even showed her the photo.

1635
01:22:57.581 --> 01:23:00.671
<i>Daddy has told
Nick's sister everything.</i>

1636
01:23:01.585 --> 01:23:02.934
She's coming over to see you.

1637
01:23:07.634 --> 01:23:08.635
Rebecca.

1638
01:23:09.332 --> 01:23:10.289
Is everything okay?

1639
01:23:10.376 --> 01:23:11.638
Uh. we need to talk.

1640
01:23:16.687 --> 01:23:18.297
Oh. my God!

1641
01:23:34.357 --> 01:23:35.401
Oh. my God.

1642
01:23:37.882 --> 01:23:38.970
Look at my two men...

1643
01:23:40.885 --> 01:23:42.060
getting to know each other.

1644
01:23:43.931 --> 01:23:44.802
Anna. Anna--

1645
01:23:44.889 --> 01:23:46.586
No. w-- Nick. wait. wait.

1646
01:23:46.673 --> 01:23:48.066
- No. no. stop. Stop.
- Get out of my way.

1647
01:23:48.153 --> 01:23:49.502
Anna!

1648
01:23:52.810 --> 01:23:54.420
Okay. no. Nick. no. wait!
Stop! Stop. stop!

1649
01:23:54.507 --> 01:23:55.943
- Let me talk to her.
- She murdered my sister!

1650
01:23:56.074 --> 01:23:58.598
Don't listen to him. Daddy.
He murdered his sister.

1651
01:23:58.772 --> 01:24:00.470
They were fighting
over their mom's money!

1652
01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:02.776
It was really her in the rug?
Is Rebecca really dead?

1653
01:24:02.907 --> 01:24:04.474
Anna. tell me--Don't listen to him.

1654
01:24:04.561 --> 01:24:06.171
The police showed me
security footage of him

1655
01:24:06.302 --> 01:24:07.477
getting rid
of his sister's body.

1656
01:24:07.564 --> 01:24:08.956
I came here to warn you and Mom!

1657
01:24:09.087 --> 01:24:10.697
- He's crazy!
- Why?

1658
01:24:11.176 --> 01:24:13.048
Why? Rebecca didn't do
anything to you!

1659
01:24:13.439 --> 01:24:15.006
Oh. my God. Think of my mom!

1660
01:24:15.093 --> 01:24:17.313
I am the one that checked in
on your mom the most.

1661
01:24:17.443 --> 01:24:18.575
She's lucky to have me. Nick.

1662
01:24:18.662 --> 01:24:20.794
No. Nick. No. Nick. stop!
No. no. no.

1663
01:24:20.881 --> 01:24:22.883
- Let go of me!
- No. stop. Nick. no! Nick!

1664
01:24:23.058 --> 01:24:23.928
No!

1665
01:24:38.943 --> 01:24:39.900
David?

1666
01:24:40.727 --> 01:24:41.728
Are you okay?

1667
01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:44.818
Yeah. I'm okay. I'm okay.

1668
01:24:49.867 --> 01:24:50.955
Anna!

1669
01:24:52.957 --> 01:24:53.914
Darling!

1670
01:24:54.045 --> 01:24:55.307
What's happened?
Are you all right?

1671
01:24:56.482 --> 01:24:57.918
Everything's gonna be all right.

1672
01:24:58.745 --> 01:25:00.356
What happened? Did you get hurt?

1673
01:25:03.663 --> 01:25:05.056
Even when you were little. Zoe.

1674
01:25:05.143 --> 01:25:07.058
you were always afraid
of the thunderstorms.

1675
01:25:07.624 --> 01:25:08.625
That's Anna.

1676
01:25:08.799 --> 01:25:10.975
She is Anna with you.

1677
01:25:11.976 --> 01:25:14.283
She can be Zoe with me.

1678
01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:16.937
She is whoever she wants to be!

1679
01:25:17.503 --> 01:25:18.896
Why. Anna?

1680
01:25:20.071 --> 01:25:21.638
Why'd you do any of this?

1681
01:25:22.639 --> 01:25:25.294
All I did... was love you.

1682
01:25:26.686 --> 01:25:28.471
You cheated on me.

1683
01:25:28.775 --> 01:25:31.169
I cheated... with you!

1684
01:25:31.735 --> 01:25:32.910
Don't you get that?

1685
01:25:33.432 --> 01:25:34.868
Are you fucking insane?

1686
01:25:34.999 --> 01:25:36.000
Don't call me that!

1687
01:25:36.087 --> 01:25:37.523
Are you-- I only cheated--

1688
01:25:37.697 --> 01:25:38.655
David. do something!

1689
01:25:38.785 --> 01:25:40.613
It's all right. Anna. Anna?

1690
01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:42.528
Can you... you tell me
what happened right now.

1691
01:25:42.659 --> 01:25:43.790
Okay? Right now.

1692
01:25:44.182 --> 01:25:45.270
When you're in love
with somebody

1693
01:25:45.357 --> 01:25:46.445
and they cheat on you.

1694
01:25:46.750 --> 01:25:48.317
it's the worst feeling
in the world.

1695
01:25:48.534 --> 01:25:49.753
What are you talking about here?

1696
01:25:49.883 --> 01:25:51.363
You know exactly
what I'm talking about!

1697
01:25:51.450 --> 01:25:52.538
None of this is about me.

1698
01:25:55.933 --> 01:25:56.934
It's all about you!

1699
01:25:58.936 --> 01:26:00.067
When Zoe and I were little.

1700
01:26:00.155 --> 01:26:02.200
she caught you
with one of your mistresses.

1701
01:26:03.462 --> 01:26:04.811
It damaged her.

1702
01:26:05.812 --> 01:26:07.727
She was never the same
after that.

1703
01:26:11.557 --> 01:26:12.732
Infidelity

1704
01:26:13.559 --> 01:26:14.821
has consequences.

1705
01:26:14.908 --> 01:26:15.822
That's... that's in the past.

1706
01:26:16.083 --> 01:26:17.563
Baby. we... we've worked
through this. okay?

1707
01:26:17.650 --> 01:26:19.261
Oh. we have. Yes. we have.

1708
01:26:19.435 --> 01:26:20.914
And Zoe-- honey. Zoe...

1709
01:26:21.741 --> 01:26:24.091
Zoe. she was a lost cause. okay?

1710
01:26:24.309 --> 01:26:25.615
She was. but you're not. okay?

1711
01:26:25.745 --> 01:26:27.747
And we can help you. honey.
We can.

1712
01:26:28.661 --> 01:26:29.662
I love you.

1713
01:26:32.404 --> 01:26:34.014
Baby. come here.
Come here. honey.

1714
01:26:34.101 --> 01:26:35.451
I love you so much. baby.

1715
01:26:42.284 --> 01:26:43.763
You shouldn't have favorites.

1716
01:26:47.071 --> 01:26:48.812
No! What have you done?

1717
01:26:48.942 --> 01:26:51.771
No. no! No. no. no! No!

1718
01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:55.601
Call somebody!

1719
01:26:55.775 --> 01:26:57.647
Please call someone! Please!

1720
01:26:58.996 --> 01:27:00.693
Stop. Stop. Stop.

1721
01:27:01.041 --> 01:27:02.608
Anna. please put down the knife.

1722
01:27:02.826 --> 01:27:04.349
Stop. Stop!

1723
01:27:04.654 --> 01:27:06.395
No!

1724
01:27:13.619 --> 01:27:15.186
Stop.

1725
01:27:20.670 --> 01:27:21.540
Come on! Come on!

1726
01:27:27.111 --> 01:27:28.068
Hurry!

1727
01:28:01.972 --> 01:28:04.496
<i>He stabbed his sister!</i>

1728
01:28:04.757 --> 01:28:06.629
<i>Then he...</i>

1729
01:28:12.417 --> 01:28:14.941
- That's him!
- He killed my husband!

1730
01:28:15.115 --> 01:28:16.073
Drop the weapon!

1731
01:28:17.727 --> 01:28:18.858
Drop it now!

1732
01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:34.831
Hands in the air!

1733
01:28:35.919 --> 01:28:37.486
Lie face down on the ground.

1734
01:28:37.573 --> 01:28:39.226
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

1735
01:28:39.662 --> 01:28:40.967
Lie down! Now!

1736
01:28:42.186 --> 01:28:43.100
Cuff him.

1737
01:28:47.626 --> 01:28:50.412
<i>Anna Mercer confirmed
the knife is from her kitchen.</i>

1738
01:28:51.238 --> 01:28:52.892
Both the mother
and the daughter saw him

1739
01:28:53.023 --> 01:28:53.937
kill the father.

1740
01:28:56.156 --> 01:28:57.984
He's going away for murder one.

1741
01:28:59.072 --> 01:29:00.335
Officer. you can take him.

1742
01:30:02.701 --> 01:30:03.789
Mom?

1743
01:30:04.050 --> 01:30:05.182
Yes. darling?

1744
01:30:05.878 --> 01:30:07.837
Do you think
Zoe will ever forgive me?

1745
01:30:08.664 --> 01:30:09.926
Forgive you for what?

1746
01:30:11.057 --> 01:30:12.363
I don't think
I can say it.

1747
01:30:12.842 --> 01:30:14.017
It's really bad.

1748
01:30:14.713 --> 01:30:15.932
Sure you can. honey.

1749
01:30:18.151 --> 01:30:19.326
It's my fault.

1750
01:30:21.198 --> 01:30:24.027
I'm the reason that Zoe
hurt herself with the knife.

1751
01:30:25.071 --> 01:30:26.029
What do you mean?

1752
01:30:27.334 --> 01:30:29.075
I slept with her boyfriend.

1753
01:30:30.207 --> 01:30:31.426
You remember Scott?

1754
01:30:33.123 --> 01:30:34.690
The only one she ever loved?

1755
01:30:36.169 --> 01:30:37.823
I wish I could take it back.

1756
01:30:41.087 --> 01:30:42.132
It's okay.

1757
01:30:42.785 --> 01:30:44.221
I'll talk to her.

1758
01:30:46.658 --> 01:30:48.094
You're her twin sister.

1759
01:30:50.749 --> 01:30:52.708
There's no greater bond
than that.

1760
01:30:53.839 --> 01:30:55.406
