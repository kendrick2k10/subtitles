628
00:33:01.312 --> 00:33:04.065
<i>-[Matt] She just won't stop.</i>
<i>-[Jordan] Listen to your daddy!</i>

629
00:33:04.148 --> 00:33:06.609
<i>Your daddy said go to bed. Maddy.</i>

630

<i>-That's not abuse. Yeah. that's not abuse.</i>
<i>-Yep.</i>

632
00:33:12.615 --> 00:33:13.449
<i>That's borderline.</i>

633
00:33:13.533 --> 00:33:16.494
<i>[woman 1] My nipples are so cracked.</i>
<i>I'm scared to even look at them.</i>

<i>[woman 2 laughs]</i>

635
00:33:17.662 --> 00:33:21.541
<i>Is it weird that breastfeeding</i>

<i>[woman 1] My husband wants sex.</i>

637
00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.587

<i>AA is down the hall to the right.</i>

642

<i>where I'm… I'm exhausted.</i>

646
00:33:46.816 --> 00:33:48.651
<i>And my face hurts.</i>
<i>and I'm getting frustrated.</i>

647
00:33:48.735 --> 00:33:50.903
<i>And I don't know</i>
<i>how to break the stroller down.</i>

648
00:33:50.987 --> 00:33:53.072
<i>I don't know how to fold it up.</i>

649
00:33:53.156 --> 00:33:56.784
<i>Okay. Well. sorry.</i>
<i>but this is a group for new mothers.</i>

650
00:33:56.868 --> 00:34:00.038
<i>You're lying. because</i>
<i>on that sign out there. it says "parents."</i>

651
00:34:00.121 --> 00:34:02.290
<i>I'm a parent.</i>
<i>and I don't know what the hell I'm doing.</i>

652
00:34:02.373 --> 00:34:04.792
<i>I don't have nobody else</i>
<i>to talk to about this shit.</i>

653
00:34:04.876 --> 00:34:07.962
<i>Speaking of shit. the girl's</i>
<i>got some stuff flyin' out of her ass.</i>

654
00:34:08.046 --> 00:34:09.130
<i>It's like a fire hose.</i>

655
00:34:09.213 --> 00:34:11.716
<i>I don't know if it's normal or not.</i>
<i>but it's two different kinds.</i>

656
00:34:11.799 --> 00:34:13.301
<i>She can either hit you with a streamer.</i>

657
00:34:13.384 --> 00:34:16.804
<i>That's when it's all put together.</i>
<i>and it's… it's a little solid.</i>

658
00:34:16.888 --> 00:34:18.306
<i>And it's… it's a direct hit.</i>

659
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:19.849
<i>Or she'll buckshot you.</i>

660
00:34:19.932 --> 00:34:23.227
<i>And that's… that's that spray.</i>
<i>It's… it's a quick… whop!</i>

661
00:34:23.311 --> 00:34:27.690
<i>I need help. I need the crying to stop.</i>

662
00:34:27.774 --> 00:34:30.026
<i>How do I make the crying stop?</i>

663
00:34:31.819 --> 00:34:35.406
<i>Okay. um. my oldest had colic</i>
<i>for the first couple of months.</i>

664
00:34:35.490 --> 00:34:38.910
<i>-What's colic?</i>
<i>-It's when babies cry for hours on end</i>

665
00:34:38.993 --> 00:34:41.788
<i>without any reason until you feel</i>
<i>like your eyes are about to pop out.</i>

666
00:34:43.289 --> 00:34:44.624
<i>I gave the baby colic.</i>

667
00:34:44.707 --> 00:34:46.834
<i>No. that's… that's not how colic works.</i>

668
00:34:46.918 --> 00:34:49.504
<i>[voice breaks] I'm not washing my hands.</i>
<i>and I'm touching the baby.</i>

669
00:34:49.587 --> 00:34:51.047
<i>And that's how I gave the baby colic.</i>

670
00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:54.926
<i>You don't give a baby colic.</i>
<i>It's more of a digestive thing.</i>

671
00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:57.512
<i>[softly] That's a relief.</i>

672
00:34:57.595 --> 00:35:00.223
<i>Thing that worked for me</i>
<i>was white noise. surprisingly.</i>

673
00:35:00.306 --> 00:35:01.349
<i>White noise?</i>

674
00:35:01.432 --> 00:35:02.642

<i>[Maddy stops crying]</i>

678

<i>And then looking ahead.</i>
<i>I'm gonna turn it over to Matt.</i>

679
00:35:30.711 --> 00:35:33.923
<i>And he's gonna show you</i>
<i>how this all can work for your customers.</i>

680
00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:35.633
<i>All right. Matt. you're up.</i>

<i>Nah. this guy never sleeps.</i>
<i>He's deep in thought.</i>

686
00:35:46.769 --> 00:35:49.689
<i>Yeah. deep in-- That's exactly what it is.</i>

687
00:35:49.772 --> 00:35:51.274
<i>Very deep in thought.</i>

688
00:35:51.357 --> 00:35:53.109
<i>Thank you. Thank you. Howard.</i>

689
00:35:53.192 --> 00:35:56.779
<i>And the reason why</i>
<i>is because I'm so excited…</i>

690
00:35:56.863 --> 00:35:58.447
<i>-[Howard] Yeah.</i>
<i>-[Matt] …uh. about this.</i>

691
00:35:58.531 --> 00:36:01.033
<i>With this upgrade. there's thousands.</i>

<i>[Oscar] I have a deviated septum.</i>

<i>Maybe that's it?</i>

699
00:36:18.593 --> 00:36:22.680
<i>No. that's… that's not what it is.</i>
<i>I'm sorry. Excuse me for a second. please.</i>

<i>[Matt] Hey. I apologize</i>
<i>for storming out like that.</i>

716
00:36:55.588 --> 00:36:56.964
<i>But she goes on these crying jags.</i>

717
00:36:57.048 --> 00:37:00.301
<i>and it's impossible</i>
<i>to really get her to stop and calm down.</i>

718
00:37:00.384 --> 00:37:03.262
<i>-Does she wanna try sucking on my pinkie?</i>
<i>-No.</i>

<i>-It helps me sleep.</i>
<i>-[sighs] Thank you.</i>

<i>She's 25 now. [chuckles]</i>

<i>And I want you to notice</i>
<i>the easy map-tree interface as well.</i>

726
00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:25.201
<i>Once again. it's about giving</i>
<i>our customers what they want.</i>

727
00:37:25.284 --> 00:37:26.285
<i>which is the simplicity.</i>

728
00:37:26.369 --> 00:37:28.663
<i>Right? Isn't that what you want. huh?</i>

729
00:37:28.746 --> 00:37:30.164
