55
00:04:40.815 --> 00:04:42.415
Do you live here in Denver?

56
00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:43.450
- We'll skip that.

57
00:04:43.483 --> 00:04:44.585
Let's skip the small talk.

58
00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:46.087

- In the last five years.
have you been treated

84
00:05:37.171 --> 00:05:39.040
for alcohol
or substance use disorder?

85
00:05:39.073 --> 00:05:40.675
This includes
community support groups

86
00:05:40.708 --> 00:05:42.510
such as Alcoholics Anonymous.

87
00:05:43.678 --> 00:05:45.012
Are they even gonna read this?

88
00:05:45.046 --> 00:05:45.880
- Who?

89
00:05:47.548 --> 00:05:49.584
- The board.

90
00:05:49.617 --> 00:05:50.818
- I imagine they will. yes.

91
00:05:50.852 --> 00:05:52.019
- Hmm.

92
00:05:52.053 --> 00:05:54.522
And if I say something
they don't like.

93
00:05:54.555 --> 00:05:55.523
then I don't get the position?

94
00:05:55.556 --> 00:05:56.489
- I can't speak to that.

95
00:05:56.524 --> 00:05:57.658
- But in your experience?

96
00:05:57.692 --> 00:05:59.627
- My experience is
what you see here.

97
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.595
I gather information.

98
00:06:00.628 --> 00:06:01.696
I verify it.

99
00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:02.930
and I produce a report.

100
00:06:02.964 --> 00:06:04.732
- So if I lied--
- I'd find out.

101
00:06:04.765 --> 00:06:06.701
- How?
- Okay. it depends.

102
00:06:06.734 --> 00:06:08.569
In the case of your height
and weight. I can use my eyes.

103
00:06:08.603 --> 00:06:10.071
You are not 6'3".

104
00:06:10.104 --> 00:06:11.739
and you do not weigh 200 pounds
carrying groceries.

105
00:06:11.772 --> 00:06:12.807
- That's funny.
- As I understand it.

106
00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:13.808
the board is considering you

107
00:06:13.841 --> 00:06:14.976
for a very high-profile--

108
00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:16.510
a crucial role in the company.
CEO.

109
00:06:16.544 --> 00:06:18.079
So no.

110
00:06:18.112 --> 00:06:18.779
They're not just gonna
take your word for it.

111
00:06:18.813 --> 00:06:20.047
if that's what you're asking.

112
00:06:20.081 --> 00:06:21.481
- That's fine.

113
00:06:21.515 --> 00:06:25.152
So. um. I guess...yes.

114
00:06:25.186 --> 00:06:27.922
- Yes. you have been treated
for alcohol use disorder?

115
00:06:31.458 --> 00:06:32.760
- Two times.

116
00:06:32.793 --> 00:06:34.595
- And I see
you currently drink.

117
00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:36.597
- Socially.

118
00:06:36.631 --> 00:06:39.466
- Do you abuse
prescription drugs?

119
00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:41.769
- Do I abuse prescription--

120
00:06:41.802 --> 00:06:43.037
- Is that confusing?

121
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.972
- Well. I take
prescription drugs.

122
00:06:45.006 --> 00:06:46.908
I don't know
how they feel about it.

123
00:06:46.941 --> 00:06:49.210
- Do you use
recreational drugs?

124
00:06:49.243 --> 00:06:52.046
Marijuana. cocaine. MDMA.
psychedelics. heroin.

125
00:06:52.079 --> 00:06:53.814

I mean. no. Not--not heroin.

127
00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:56.684
Come on.

128
00:06:56.717 --> 00:06:58.586
- How many times?

129
00:06:58.619 --> 00:07:02.023
- Um. how many times
have I used recreational drugs?

130
00:07:02.056 --> 00:07:03.124
- Yes.

131
00:07:03.157 --> 00:07:04.625
- Ever?

132
00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:05.960
- Yes.

133
00:07:05.993 --> 00:07:07.128
- I mean. it's thousands.

134
00:07:07.161 --> 00:07:07.828
Tens of thousands.

135
00:07:07.862 --> 00:07:09.163
I don't know. I have no idea.

136
00:07:09.196 --> 00:07:10.831
- Okay. would you like me
to write that?

137
00:07:10.865 --> 00:07:12.533
You said I shouldn't lie.

138
00:07:12.566 --> 00:07:13.834
- Do you suffer from any

139
00:07:13.868 --> 00:07:14.969

00:07:15.002 --> 00:07:17.071
HIV/AIDS.
herpes simplex B. HPV.

141
00:07:17.104 --> 00:07:18.773
- If you want to know that
for yourself.

142
00:07:18.806 --> 00:07:20.007
I'm happy to tell you about it.

143
00:07:20.041 --> 00:07:20.908
- It's part
of the questionnaire.

144
00:07:20.942 --> 00:07:22.143
- No. it's not.
- It is.

145
00:07:26.981 --> 00:07:28.616
Maybe you'd like me
to write all of them.

146
00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:33.955
Maybe you'd like me to write.

147
00:07:33.988 --> 00:07:36.524
"Hal Porterfield fucks
like Caligula."

148
00:07:44.932 --> 00:07:48.936
Hal Porterfield fucks
like Caligula.

149
00:07:53.874 --> 00:07:55.776
You lost your virginity
at what age?

150
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:00.648
- Come on.

151
00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:02.183
- What?

152
00:08:02.216 --> 00:08:03.718
- What is this?

153
00:08:03.751 --> 00:08:06.520
- It's the next question.

154
00:08:10.591 --> 00:08:12.193
- 13.
- No.

155
00:08:12.226 --> 00:08:12.960

- Hal.

158
00:08:19.633 --> 00:08:20.901
I swear to God.

159
00:08:20.935 --> 00:08:22.036
this is all gonna go
a lot faster

160
00:08:22.069 --> 00:08:24.071
if you just tell the truth.

161
00:08:25.606 --> 00:08:27.241
You've never been
anywhere close to a rehab.

162
00:08:27.274 --> 00:08:28.809
and you can barely sip that
whiskey without grimacing.

163
00:08:28.843 --> 00:08:29.844
So please stop posturing.

164
00:08:29.877 --> 00:08:31.212
You are embarrassing yourself.

165
00:08:31.245 --> 00:08:32.780
I'm gonna write that
you lost your virginity at 25.

166
00:08:32.813 --> 00:08:34.215
and we're gonna move on. okay?

167
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.185
- Fine.

168
00:08:44.358 --> 00:08:46.060
What?

169
00:08:49.296 --> 00:08:50.831
- That's true. isn't it?

170
00:08:54.802 --> 00:08:56.737
You lost your virginity at 25?

171
00:08:56.771 --> 00:08:58.606
- What's the next question?

172
00:08:58.639 --> 00:08:59.740
- It's actually true.

173
00:08:59.774 --> 00:09:01.609
- What is next on your form.

174
00:09:01.642 --> 00:09:02.777
Miss Attorney?

175
00:09:03.844 --> 00:09:06.781
- That's fascinating.

176
00:09:06.814 --> 00:09:08.783
- What are you doing?

177
00:09:08.816 --> 00:09:10.051
- I...

178
00:09:11.318 --> 00:09:14.155
You're not ugly.

179
00:09:14.188 --> 00:09:17.191
There's gotta be
plenty of girls out there

180
00:09:17.224 --> 00:09:19.360
who brush their teeth
until all their gums come off

181
00:09:19.393 --> 00:09:21.662
and prepare all their meals
at the beginning of the week

182
00:09:21.695 --> 00:09:24.265
who'd have no problem

183
00:09:24.298 --> 00:09:26.700
going down on
a sweet little nothing like you

184
00:09:26.734 --> 00:09:27.935
with your clean ass.

185
00:09:35.176 --> 00:09:36.877
- Mm.

186
00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:40.981
Yeah.

187
00:09:43.117 --> 00:09:44.118
No.

188
00:09:46.854 --> 00:09:49.190
This--okay.

189
00:09:50.825 --> 00:09:52.827
This is--this isn't--
this isn't what I wanted.

190
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.929
This--it's not in the script.

191
00:09:59.366 --> 00:10:01.635
- The script.

192
00:10:01.669 --> 00:10:03.003
- Yeah.

193
00:10:03.037 --> 00:10:04.672
You're supposed to ask me...
- Right.

194
00:10:04.705 --> 00:10:06.340
- How many times a day
I masturbate.

195
00:10:06.373 --> 00:10:08.275
- "I want you to tell me
in a really mean voice

196
00:10:08.309 --> 00:10:10.244
"that you're going to write
that I lost my virginity at 25.

197
00:10:10.277 --> 00:10:11.812
"and then
we're going to move on.

198
00:10:11.846 --> 00:10:13.147
"And then the next question is.

199
00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.248
'Hal. how many times a day
do you masturbate?'"

200
00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:15.850
- Right.

201
00:10:15.883 --> 00:10:18.152
And then this stuff
about my cock.

202
00:10:18.185 --> 00:10:20.287
- Right. I see that. Yeah.
- Right.

203
00:10:20.321 --> 00:10:22.790
So that's what
I want you to say.

204
00:10:22.823 --> 00:10:24.291
So--so what's the problem
exactly?

205
00:10:24.325 --> 00:10:25.659
- You want me to stick
to your script?

206
00:10:25.693 --> 00:10:26.760
- I do.

207
00:10:26.794 --> 00:10:28.095
Yeah. you were doing great.

208
00:10:28.129 --> 00:10:29.697
You just don't have to add
all the other stuff.

209
00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.332
I wrote it out so you'd know
exactly what to say.

210
00:10:31.365 --> 00:10:32.266
- Got it.

211
00:10:34.034 --> 00:10:35.769
The man knows what he wants.

212
00:10:35.803 --> 00:10:37.371
- Exactly.

213
00:10:37.404 --> 00:10:40.040
- And I'm all about
customer service.

214
00:10:40.074 --> 00:10:41.142
- Love hearing that.

215
00:10:44.178 --> 00:10:45.346
- I just...

216
00:10:45.379 --> 00:10:46.280
- What?

217
00:10:49.049 --> 00:10:50.417
- Can I say one thing
before we dive back in?

218
00:10:50.451 --> 00:10:52.286
- Sure.

219
00:10:52.319 --> 00:10:53.754
- I can tell that you put
a lot of thought into this.

220
00:10:53.787 --> 00:10:55.022
and I don't want to diminish

221
00:10:55.055 --> 00:10:55.756
all the great work
that you've done.

222
00:10:55.789 --> 00:10:56.724
- Oh. thanks.
No. that's fine.

223
00:10:56.757 --> 00:10:58.192
If you just read the script--
- Excuse me.

224
00:11:00.427 --> 00:11:01.729
I'm speaking.

225
00:11:01.762 --> 00:11:03.063
- Okay.

226
00:11:03.097 --> 00:11:05.232
- The service that I offer
is very specific.

227
00:11:05.266 --> 00:11:06.967
And as I said in my email--
- I read the email.

228
00:11:07.001 --> 00:11:07.536
I'm not breaking
any of the rules.

229
00:11:07.569 --> 00:11:08.869
We're not gonna touch.

230
00:11:08.903 --> 00:11:09.870
- It's not about the rules
exactly.

231
00:11:09.904 --> 00:11:11.172
It's--
- I get it.

232
00:11:11.205 --> 00:11:12.006
There's no touching.
That makes it hotter.

233
00:11:12.039 --> 00:11:14.341
Actually. I'm on board--
- Hal. Hal!

234
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:17.945
I need some quiet.

235
00:11:26.453 --> 00:11:29.924
It's not about the rules.

236
00:11:29.957 --> 00:11:31.859
and it's not about
what arouses you.

237
00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.895
That's. like. incidental.

238
00:11:37.031 --> 00:11:40.000
The reason
that I don't touch my clients

239
00:11:40.034 --> 00:11:41.869
and that they don't touch me...

240
00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:49.777
Is that what they need from me
is not physical.

241
00:11:58.385 --> 00:12:00.187
It's mental.

242
00:12:00.221 --> 00:12:01.222
- Yeah.

243
00:12:01.255 --> 00:12:02.957
And all this. it's mental.

244
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:04.124
I'm saying it's better--

245
00:12:04.158 --> 00:12:05.326
- And I am saying
that this might be

246
00:12:05.359 --> 00:12:06.460
what you think that you want.

247
00:12:06.493 --> 00:12:08.762
but respectfully.
you have no idea.

248
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:17.505
I am saying that if
I held a gun to your head.

249
00:12:17.539 --> 00:12:20.474
you couldn't tell me what it is
that you really want.

250
00:12:20.508 --> 00:12:21.610
- All right. All right.

251
00:12:21.643 --> 00:12:24.011
I guess we should just
figure out how much I owe you.

252
00:12:24.044 --> 00:12:24.979
'cause this isn't--

253
00:12:25.012 --> 00:12:27.014
- Don't do that.

254
00:12:27.047 --> 00:12:32.286
Don't sigh and roll your eyes
like you're fucking retarded.

255
00:12:32.319 --> 00:12:34.788
What am I feeling right now
about you. huh?

256
00:12:36.023 --> 00:12:37.992
- I don't know.

257
00:12:40.361 --> 00:12:43.330
- Well...

258
00:12:43.364 --> 00:12:45.399
how about you think
for a second before you speak?

259
00:12:47.602 --> 00:12:49.336
Have you ever tried that?

260
00:12:52.339 --> 00:12:53.407
- You're disappointed in me?

261
00:12:57.111 --> 00:12:58.445
I am.
- Mm-hmm.

262
00:13:00.314 --> 00:13:02.550
Mm.

263
00:13:02.584 --> 00:13:04.184
- You're not as stupid
as you look.

264
00:13:07.121 --> 00:13:09.390
- Do you want to make me
less disappointed?

265
00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.862
- What can I do?

266
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.070
- Don't ask questions.

267
00:13:29.577 --> 00:13:32.313
This is a nice place.

268
00:13:32.346 --> 00:13:33.881
- Thanks.

269
00:13:44.925 --> 00:13:46.360
- Show me the bathroom.

270
00:14:14.121 --> 00:14:15.956
Is this it?

271
00:14:15.989 --> 00:14:17.124
- Mm-hmm.

272
00:14:24.932 --> 00:14:27.468
This needs to be cleaned.

273
00:14:34.274 --> 00:14:35.943
- Are you gonna clean it?

274
00:14:40.515 --> 00:14:41.949
- Okay.

275
00:15:04.037 --> 00:15:05.172
- You're gonna clean
the bathroom

276
00:15:05.205 --> 00:15:07.174
by fucking up
the beautiful hand towels?

277
00:15:09.376 --> 00:15:10.678
Try thinking.

278
00:15:13.548 --> 00:15:15.315
Attaboy.

279
00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:24.559
Is it dirty?

280
00:15:27.529 --> 00:15:29.363
- Um...

281
00:15:29.396 --> 00:15:32.499
- Is the counter dirty. Hal?

282
00:15:34.134 --> 00:15:36.538
It's all pretty clean. I think.

283
00:15:36.571 --> 00:15:37.705
- Stop.

284
00:15:40.207 --> 00:15:41.709
Look at me.

285
00:15:45.078 --> 00:15:48.182
It's not all clean.

286
00:15:48.215 --> 00:15:51.318
There's dirt.

287
00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:55.022
You're just too lazy and sloppy
to find it.

288
00:15:57.357 --> 00:15:59.493
Do you need help?

289
00:16:02.296 --> 00:16:03.731
- Yes.

290
00:16:05.767 --> 00:16:08.101
- Then ask for it.

291
00:16:09.671 --> 00:16:11.739
- Will you help me
clean the bathroom?

292
00:16:11.773 --> 00:16:14.642
- Sure.

293
00:16:14.676 --> 00:16:17.712
You can start by
getting on the floor.

294
00:16:21.281 --> 00:16:24.384
Hal. you're gonna ruin
your clothes.

295
00:16:29.122 --> 00:16:30.692
- I should take them off?

296
00:16:33.093 --> 00:16:34.729
- What the fuck do you think?

297
00:16:55.617 --> 00:16:57.150
Look at you.

298
00:16:59.521 --> 00:17:02.189
Barely cast a shadow.

299
00:17:19.874 --> 00:17:21.609
Crawl to the toilet.

300
00:17:28.516 --> 00:17:32.620
I want you to clean
behind the toilet.

301
00:17:34.388 --> 00:17:37.324
That's where the dirt is.

302
00:17:46.834 --> 00:17:48.536
Hal.

303
00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:51.506
- Yes?

304
00:17:51.539 --> 00:17:54.341
- When you think of yourself.
what do you see?

305
00:17:56.711 --> 00:17:59.714
Is it something like garbage?

306
00:17:59.747 --> 00:18:02.482
- No.

307
00:18:02.517 --> 00:18:04.451
- I think it's like
a small white bag

308
00:18:04.484 --> 00:18:05.787
of rotten food
and snotted tissue

309
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.789
and broken glass.

310
00:18:07.822 --> 00:18:09.591
- No.

311
00:18:09.624 --> 00:18:12.827
- Maybe like a mound
in the corner of a landfill?

312
00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:14.428
The slime that comes
out of the bottom?

313
00:18:14.461 --> 00:18:15.763
The shit that just sits there

314
00:18:15.797 --> 00:18:16.764
that the Earth
won't even take.

315
00:18:16.798 --> 00:18:18.900
not for one million years?

316
00:18:40.655 --> 00:18:43.457
This is very clean.

317
00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:44.792
- Thank you.

318
00:18:47.629 --> 00:18:49.429
- You might've earned a treat.

319
00:18:51.766 --> 00:18:53.601
Are you excited?

320
00:18:55.603 --> 00:18:58.706
You are?

321
00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.474
Okay.

322
00:19:00.508 --> 00:19:02.409
You can show me.

323
00:19:16.356 --> 00:19:18.191
Do you want to come?

324
00:19:24.999 --> 00:19:27.200
Are you thinking about
what I want to hear?

325
00:19:27.234 --> 00:19:28.870
- Yes.

326
00:19:28.903 --> 00:19:30.337
- Well. stop.

327
00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:31.939
Do you want to come or not?

328
00:19:34.241 --> 00:19:37.344
- Yes.

329
00:19:37.377 --> 00:19:39.814
- Then ask me.

330
00:19:39.847 --> 00:19:41.214
- Can I come?

331
00:19:41.248 --> 00:19:42.349
- No.
- Please?

332
00:19:42.382 --> 00:19:44.852
- No!

333
00:19:44.886 --> 00:19:46.253
You can jerk off.
but if you come.

334
00:19:46.286 --> 00:19:47.220
I'll ruin your fucking life.

335
00:19:47.254 --> 00:19:47.989
Is that clear?

336
00:19:48.022 --> 00:19:49.322
- Oh. yes.

337
00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:52.492
- Go ahead.

338
00:20:09.544 --> 00:20:10.845
- How's it going over there?

339
00:20:12.345 --> 00:20:13.514
- Good.

340
00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:17.685
- Stop for a second.

341
00:20:20.855 --> 00:20:21.889
- Don't look at me.

342
00:20:23.057 --> 00:20:24.759
Sorry.

343
00:20:24.792 --> 00:20:26.027
- If you come without
my permission. Hal. that is it.

344
00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:26.994
I swear to God.

345
00:20:31.465 --> 00:20:33.366
You can do a little more.

346
00:20:56.691 --> 00:20:58.391
You know what you actually are?

347
00:21:01.763 --> 00:21:03.396
It's like...

348
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:04.899
imagine something that exists.

349
00:21:04.932 --> 00:21:06.901
like a bright red apple.

350
00:21:08.368 --> 00:21:10.403
Now imagine that it's gone.

351
00:21:12.106 --> 00:21:14.609
That is you.

352
00:21:14.642 --> 00:21:17.545
You aren't anything.

353
00:21:17.578 --> 00:21:20.548
You don't even take up space.

354
00:21:20.581 --> 00:21:21.516
- Oh. fuck.

355
00:21:23.618 --> 00:21:24.752
Okay.
- Okay.

356
00:21:24.786 --> 00:21:25.920
- I need to.
- You need to?

357
00:21:25.953 --> 00:21:26.854
- Yeah. is it okay?
- You need to?

358
00:21:26.888 --> 00:21:27.420
- Is it okay?

359
00:21:27.454 --> 00:21:29.891
- Do you need to come?

360
00:21:29.924 --> 00:21:31.491
No. It's not okay.

361
00:21:31.526 --> 00:21:32.627
Stop. Take your hand away.

362
00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:33.795
Take your hand away.

363
00:21:38.766 --> 00:21:40.034
- Hal.

364
00:21:41.903 --> 00:21:43.436
Hal. look at me.

365
00:21:49.844 --> 00:21:51.612
You can't touch yourself.

366
00:21:51.646 --> 00:21:53.781
but you can come now.

367
00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:58.385
You have my permission.

368
00:22:15.937 --> 00:22:18.606
- I know what you need
because you're mine.

369
00:22:23.578 --> 00:22:26.514
I know everything about you.

370
00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.195
- Ribeye. two martinis.

371
00:24:21.228 --> 00:24:23.998
a bottle of Montepulciano.
and a hot fudge sundae.

372
00:24:24.031 --> 00:24:25.733
- Perfect. Thanks. Julian.

373
00:24:25.766 --> 00:24:26.834
I can take it from here.
- Great.

374
00:24:26.867 --> 00:24:28.102
Oh. and it's Paul.

375
00:24:28.135 --> 00:24:30.504
- Oh. is it? Sorry about that.

376
00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:53.260
You're incredible.

377
00:24:53.294 --> 00:24:54.662
You know that?

378
00:24:58.165 --> 00:24:59.667
- It takes two.

379
00:25:13.347 --> 00:25:15.216
What?

380
00:25:15.249 --> 00:25:18.185
- Mm. nothing.
I like watching you eat.

381
00:25:18.219 --> 00:25:19.553
- It's 'cause you're a pervert.

382
00:25:24.959 --> 00:25:26.594
I really liked that scene.

383
00:25:26.627 --> 00:25:27.728
- Yeah?

384
00:25:27.762 --> 00:25:28.896
What'd you like about it?

385
00:25:31.032 --> 00:25:33.601
- How committed you were.

386
00:25:33.634 --> 00:25:34.902
How much it meant to you.

387
00:25:37.038 --> 00:25:39.707
It's exciting to me
when it gets like that.

388
00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:41.242
- Yeah. for me too.

389
00:25:41.275 --> 00:25:46.213
- The part about my work.
how it's mental. not physical.

390
00:25:46.247 --> 00:25:48.783
- Well. you said that to me
at our first session.

391
00:25:48.816 --> 00:25:49.617
Remember?
- Of course.

392
00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:51.786
- Yeah.

393
00:25:51.819 --> 00:25:53.087
- I thought it was interesting.

394
00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.889
you bringing in
the real-life stuff.

395
00:25:54.922 --> 00:25:57.291
- Real life?

396
00:25:57.324 --> 00:25:58.793
- Your dad's passing

397
00:25:58.826 --> 00:26:00.761
and your new role
at the company.

398
00:26:00.795 --> 00:26:02.797
How are you doing?

399
00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:03.831
I mean. this must be so--

400
00:26:03.864 --> 00:26:04.999
- Yeah. uh. no.

401
00:26:05.032 --> 00:26:09.136
It's been. uh.
a lot to process.

402
00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:11.138
And I've been dealing
with the inheritance

403
00:26:11.172 --> 00:26:15.076
and people coming
out of the woodwork.

404
00:26:15.109 --> 00:26:16.644
I just keep wanting
to turn to him

405
00:26:16.677 --> 00:26:18.279
because I'm expecting
some joke or...

406
00:26:20.381 --> 00:26:21.882
I just miss him.

407
00:26:24.251 --> 00:26:26.687
Yeah.

408
00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.989
He was a fearless--

409
00:26:29.023 --> 00:26:30.624
he was an asshole.

410
00:26:32.226 --> 00:26:35.863
You know. but I've never met
anyone like him.

411
00:26:35.896 --> 00:26:37.998
Mm.

412
00:26:38.032 --> 00:26:39.967
- It sounds really.
really tough.

413
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.036
- Mm. How do you know
about all this?

414
00:26:42.069 --> 00:26:45.306
- Well. when your dad passed.
there was an article I read.

415
00:26:45.339 --> 00:26:48.142
and it said that you were
his presumptive successor.

416
00:26:48.175 --> 00:26:49.844
So--
- No. I am--

417
00:26:49.877 --> 00:26:51.679
I am his successor.
That's the plan.

418
00:26:51.712 --> 00:26:54.248
- Presumptive successor. right?

419
00:26:54.281 --> 00:26:56.317
- Oh. right.

420
00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:57.852
Right.

421
00:26:57.885 --> 00:27:00.121
Yeah. no. this has been. um...

422
00:27:00.154 --> 00:27:01.255
expected of me. really.

423
00:27:01.288 --> 00:27:04.859
It's my--I mean. my whole life.

424
00:27:04.892 --> 00:27:06.861
and basically.
just been waiting

425
00:27:06.894 --> 00:27:09.930
for this moment for years.

426
00:27:09.964 --> 00:27:11.732
- It's such a big deal. right?

427
00:27:11.765 --> 00:27:13.267
- I was actually gonna say
the opposite

428
00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:15.436
because this has been part
of the plan for so long.

429
00:27:15.469 --> 00:27:19.373
I mean. I guess there's
a few kind of small things

430
00:27:19.406 --> 00:27:20.774
to get sorted out.

431
00:27:20.808 --> 00:27:22.376
- The board?
- The board?

432
00:27:22.409 --> 00:27:24.945
- Well. I noticed in the scene.

433
00:27:24.979 --> 00:27:27.348
um. you had the board

434
00:27:27.381 --> 00:27:30.384
as this looming threat
hanging over you.

435
00:27:30.417 --> 00:27:32.853
- Right.

436
00:27:32.887 --> 00:27:36.757
That's interesting
that you would think that.

437
00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:40.327
But the thing is.
we don't have a board.

438
00:27:42.163 --> 00:27:43.731
- Oh.

439
00:27:43.764 --> 00:27:45.299
- I think I got something
stuck in my...

440
00:27:46.467 --> 00:27:48.035
- I just thought
every public company

441
00:27:48.068 --> 00:27:49.837
had a board of directors.

442
00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:50.905
- We don't.

443
00:27:50.938 --> 00:27:53.073
That's not how
we're structured.

444
00:27:54.775 --> 00:27:56.076
- Oh.

445
00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:57.878
- But anyway. listen.

446
00:27:57.912 --> 00:28:00.214
Um. I got something for you.

447
00:28:14.461 --> 00:28:15.296
- What is it?

448
00:28:15.329 --> 00:28:16.964
Open it.

449
00:28:22.036 --> 00:28:23.137
- Do you like it?

450
00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:24.838
- Fucking God. I mean...

451
00:28:26.874 --> 00:28:30.144
- It's a. um. Audemars Piguet.

452
00:28:30.177 --> 00:28:33.113
You know what that is?

453
00:28:33.147 --> 00:28:35.482
It's. like. one of the nicest
watches in the world.

454
00:28:38.419 --> 00:28:41.021
- I--I just don't--

455
00:28:41.055 --> 00:28:42.790
I don't--
I don't know what to say.

456
00:28:42.823 --> 00:28:45.459
- Don't. Just try it on.

457
00:28:45.492 --> 00:28:46.894
Just look at it.

458
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:54.301
Yeah. it's the right color.

459
00:28:58.038 --> 00:29:02.910
Um. maybe
you already know this.

460
00:29:02.943 --> 00:29:06.146
but what you do.

461
00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:08.215
your work.

462
00:29:08.249 --> 00:29:11.352
it's incredibly valuable.

463
00:29:11.385 --> 00:29:15.322
and it's made a big difference
in my life.

464
00:29:15.356 --> 00:29:19.527
I don't know how to thank you.
so yeah.

465
00:29:19.561 --> 00:29:21.095
- This is a start.

466
00:29:21.128 --> 00:29:22.363
- I'm glad.

467
00:29:26.133 --> 00:29:29.003
It's gonna be so weird
to not have this

468
00:29:29.036 --> 00:29:31.005
as part of my routine anymore.

469
00:29:31.038 --> 00:29:34.141
I'm a little worried. actually.

470
00:29:34.174 --> 00:29:35.476
- What do you mean?

471
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:37.512
- Well. just. you know.
what I said. it's--

472
00:29:37.545 --> 00:29:41.215
how it's been
so helpful for me.

473
00:29:42.584 --> 00:29:45.019
- Yeah. well--
but why wouldn't it be

474
00:29:45.052 --> 00:29:48.022
a part of your routine?

475
00:29:48.055 --> 00:29:51.158
- Isn't this why you brought up
the stuff about the company?

476
00:29:51.191 --> 00:29:52.560
I thought you understood.

477
00:29:52.594 --> 00:29:54.328
- Understood? No.

478
00:29:58.399 --> 00:30:02.269
- I've been thinking that this
is probably not a good idea--

479
00:30:02.303 --> 00:30:04.539
well. in fact.
I know it's not--

480
00:30:04.572 --> 00:30:07.241
for us--

481
00:30:07.274 --> 00:30:13.914
for me to keep doing this...
with you.

482
00:30:13.947 --> 00:30:15.282
- Mm.

483
00:30:17.084 --> 00:30:18.520
May I ask why?

484
00:30:18.553 --> 00:30:20.220
- I mean. you said it yourself.

485
00:30:20.254 --> 00:30:22.056
You know.
this job and everything.

486
00:30:22.089 --> 00:30:23.390
it's a really big deal.

487
00:30:23.424 --> 00:30:26.193
And I--if I'm gonna do this.
I'm...

488
00:30:29.963 --> 00:30:34.234
I need to match up
my insides with my outsides

489
00:30:34.268 --> 00:30:37.572
and be a person
that I want people to see.

490
00:30:37.605 --> 00:30:40.007
a person who wins.

491
00:30:41.442 --> 00:30:43.377
A person who wins?

492
00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:47.214
What we do in here.
it's so meaningful.

493
00:30:47.247 --> 00:30:49.917
- Mm.
- But it's just not something

494
00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:54.589
that goes with
the next stage of my life.

495
00:30:54.622 --> 00:30:56.290
Does that make sense?
- Sure.

496
00:30:56.323 --> 00:30:58.425
- I thought the watch
would kind of communicate this

497
00:30:58.459 --> 00:31:01.028
better than--
- Oh. Oh. No. I get it.

498
00:31:01.061 --> 00:31:03.130
Um. it was like
a retirement gift.

499
00:31:04.431 --> 00:31:06.967
Like I'm--like I'm a cop
or something.

500
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:07.968
- A cop?

501
00:31:09.571 --> 00:31:10.971
- I should go.

502
00:31:13.608 --> 00:31:15.976
- I'll walk you down.

503
00:31:16.009 --> 00:31:17.444
- Walk me down?

504
00:31:17.478 --> 00:31:18.646
- Yeah.

505
00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:20.114
- No.

506
00:31:20.147 --> 00:31:22.249
No.

507
00:31:22.282 --> 00:31:23.518
Goodbye here. please.

508
00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:28.188
- I'm--I'm really gonna
miss this.

509
00:31:28.222 --> 00:31:29.990
I--I hope you believe me.

510
00:31:38.031 --> 00:31:40.300
Hey. Wait.

511
00:31:40.334 --> 00:31:44.138
Do you--you--
you don't want this?

512
00:31:50.043 --> 00:31:51.979
- Pleasure doing business.

513
00:33:31.813 --> 00:33:33.681
- Um. I don't have
a strong opinion.

514
00:33:33.715 --> 00:33:36.718
so I'm saying
whatever you think is best is--

515
00:33:36.751 --> 00:33:38.686
- Hi.
- Hi.

516
00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.522
- There's one more thing.
- Okay.

517
00:33:40.555 --> 00:33:42.122
- Can I come back in?

518
00:33:42.155 --> 00:33:44.458
- Hey. can I call you back?
Someone's here.

519
00:33:44.491 --> 00:33:46.561
Because I'm not a flowers guy.

520
00:33:46.594 --> 00:33:48.328
No. I do care.

521
00:33:48.362 --> 00:33:50.264
but can we just talk
about this in a little bit?

522
00:33:50.297 --> 00:33:51.799
You too.

523
00:33:51.833 --> 00:33:52.767
What are you doing?
- Who was that?

524
00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:54.769
- Uh. nobody. It's--

525
00:33:54.802 --> 00:33:55.603
- Didn't sound like nobody.

526
00:33:55.637 --> 00:33:57.437
She wants you
to pick out flowers.

527
00:33:57.471 --> 00:33:59.239
What did--what did you need?

528
00:34:05.345 --> 00:34:07.381
- "The first thing

529
00:34:07.414 --> 00:34:09.684
"and the hardest thing
in business

530
00:34:09.717 --> 00:34:13.053
is to know who you are."

531
00:34:14.354 --> 00:34:18.392
"So before I give
a presentation.

532
00:34:18.425 --> 00:34:20.528
"before I walk into a meeting.

533
00:34:20.562 --> 00:34:24.431
"before I sit down
for a cup of coffee.

534
00:34:24.464 --> 00:34:26.768
I always do the same thing."

535
00:34:30.137 --> 00:34:32.339
"I match up my insides
with my outsides."

536
00:34:32.372 --> 00:34:33.741
- You read my dad's book.
Congratulations.

537
00:34:33.775 --> 00:34:35.810
- "I remember that while
there are lucky strokes

538
00:34:35.843 --> 00:34:38.378
"and setbacks in life.

539
00:34:38.412 --> 00:34:40.682
"over any considerable
period of time.

540
00:34:40.715 --> 00:34:42.717
"the truth becomes clear.

541
00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:47.254
"There are those who win
and those who don't.

542
00:34:47.287 --> 00:34:48.590
"and I remember that

543
00:34:48.623 --> 00:34:51.559
I have answered that question
for myself."

544
00:34:53.761 --> 00:34:59.867
"I am a person...who wins."

545
00:34:59.901 --> 00:35:02.804
- Thank you for that.

546
00:35:02.837 --> 00:35:06.473
- You couldn't even fire me
without stealing from him.

547
00:35:06.507 --> 00:35:07.742
- I mean. come on.

548
00:35:07.775 --> 00:35:09.443
Obviously.
I've learned things from him.

549
00:35:09.476 --> 00:35:11.278
- That's not
what I'm talking about.

550
00:35:13.514 --> 00:35:14.916
I want to know something.

551
00:35:14.949 --> 00:35:16.618
Which is it?

552
00:35:16.651 --> 00:35:18.485
- Which is what?

553
00:35:18.519 --> 00:35:21.789
- Do you tend to win
or do the other thing?

554
00:35:21.823 --> 00:35:24.659
- Do you want me to acknowledge
that I have been lucky.

555
00:35:24.692 --> 00:35:26.794
that I have had it better
than most people?

556
00:35:26.828 --> 00:35:28.462
I will. So--
- Answer the question.

557
00:35:28.495 --> 00:35:29.731
- I don't feel like doing that.

558
00:35:29.764 --> 00:35:31.498
- Well. what did
your father think?

559
00:35:31.532 --> 00:35:33.266
- Judging by the fact that he
left me the company. I mean--

560
00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:34.502
- We know
that's what he wanted.

561
00:35:34.535 --> 00:35:36.804
I'm asking
what he thought of you.

562
00:35:36.838 --> 00:35:38.506
- Listen. this is
completely inappropriate.

563
00:35:38.539 --> 00:35:39.774
and it's weird
what you're doing.

564
00:35:39.807 --> 00:35:41.274
- Okay. so we've established
what he thought.

565
00:35:41.308 --> 00:35:43.276
You tend to lose.

566
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:45.178
- And what about you?
- Me?

567
00:35:45.212 --> 00:35:47.481
- Yeah. you--
you know. deep down.

568
00:35:47.515 --> 00:35:49.550
without any doubt
that you're a winner?

569
00:35:49.584 --> 00:35:51.318
You can say that
about yourself?

570
00:35:53.286 --> 00:35:54.789
- The first time that
I went to the dentist.

571
00:35:54.822 --> 00:35:57.290
I was 19 years old.

572
00:35:57.324 --> 00:35:58.593
- Okay.

573
00:35:58.626 --> 00:35:59.761
- He took one look
inside of my mouth.

574
00:35:59.794 --> 00:36:01.929
and do you know what he said?

575
00:36:01.963 --> 00:36:03.698
- No.

576
00:36:03.731 --> 00:36:06.199
- He said. "Perfect."

577
00:36:06.233 --> 00:36:08.335
He said. "A plus."

578
00:36:08.368 --> 00:36:09.637
I did that--me--

579
00:36:09.671 --> 00:36:10.805
because nobody else
gave a flying fuck.

580
00:36:10.838 --> 00:36:12.339
That is who I am.

581
00:36:15.943 --> 00:36:18.345
- Okay. it doesn't matter
what my father thought.

582
00:36:18.378 --> 00:36:20.515
I am in this position.
and I can say with confidence

583
00:36:20.548 --> 00:36:21.949
that I can do this job.

584
00:36:21.983 --> 00:36:24.552
I know what it takes.
I am--I am prepared.

585
00:36:24.585 --> 00:36:26.854
That is all that matters.
- Mm.

586
00:36:26.888 --> 00:36:28.488
I believe you
when you say that.

587
00:36:30.024 --> 00:36:30.925
- Because?

588
00:36:30.958 --> 00:36:31.993
- Why?

589
00:36:32.026 --> 00:36:33.293
- I do believe it.

590
00:36:33.326 --> 00:36:35.530
- Yeah. Why?

591
00:36:35.563 --> 00:36:38.465
- Why what?

592
00:36:38.498 --> 00:36:41.536
- Your dad didn't believe
you could.

593
00:36:41.569 --> 00:36:44.839
Where did you get the idea.
the gall.

594
00:36:44.872 --> 00:36:46.674
to think that
you could step into

595
00:36:46.708 --> 00:36:51.478
his huge. old. priceless shoes?

596
00:36:58.385 --> 00:36:59.887
From me.

597
00:37:01.856 --> 00:37:07.662
You would be unfit
if it were not for me.

598
00:37:07.695 --> 00:37:09.463
- What are you talking about?

599
00:37:09.496 --> 00:37:11.966
- I'm saying your new job.

600
00:37:11.999 --> 00:37:15.402
you wouldn't be able to do it
without what I taught you.

601
00:37:15.435 --> 00:37:17.404
- What you taught me?

602
00:37:17.437 --> 00:37:18.506
- Yes.

603
00:37:18.539 --> 00:37:20.273
- I--but. you know.

604
00:37:20.307 --> 00:37:22.610
what we do here. it's for fun.

605
00:37:22.643 --> 00:37:24.912
It's not. you know--

606
00:37:24.946 --> 00:37:25.913
- What?

607
00:37:25.947 --> 00:37:26.848
- Real.

608
00:37:28.082 --> 00:37:29.449
- Hal.

609
00:37:29.483 --> 00:37:30.952
- It's not.

610
00:37:30.985 --> 00:37:32.820
It has nothing to do
with the real world.

611
00:37:32.854 --> 00:37:33.921
and that is what I love
about it.

612
00:37:33.955 --> 00:37:36.791
- You don't look it.
but you really are so stupid.

613
00:37:36.824 --> 00:37:37.859
- I don't want to play
right now.

614
00:37:37.892 --> 00:37:39.927
- I'm not.

615
00:37:39.961 --> 00:37:41.729
- So what do you think
you taught me?

616
00:37:41.763 --> 00:37:43.396
- You know.
- I don't.

617
00:37:44.932 --> 00:37:45.833
Confidence.

618
00:37:45.867 --> 00:37:48.335
- By doing everything
you tell me to do?

619
00:37:48.368 --> 00:37:49.837
By submitting to you.
that taught me confidence?

620
00:37:49.871 --> 00:37:51.072
- Okay.
when you first emailed me.

621
00:37:51.105 --> 00:37:52.507
when we first met.
you were like this.

622
00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:54.075
You were like this.
Meh-meh-meh-meh.

623
00:37:54.108 --> 00:37:56.010
And you could barely speak.

624
00:37:56.043 --> 00:37:57.444
Now look at you.

625
00:37:57.477 --> 00:37:59.614
Look at you.

626
00:37:59.647 --> 00:38:01.048
You write me a script
and you tell me

627
00:38:01.082 --> 00:38:03.985
exactly what I should say
and exactly what I should do.

628
00:38:05.753 --> 00:38:06.988
You don't even fucking know
what happened.

629
00:38:07.021 --> 00:38:08.823
I taught you how to ask
for what you want.

630
00:38:08.856 --> 00:38:10.525
You couldn't do that
before you met me.

631
00:38:10.558 --> 00:38:11.659
- I thanked you.

632
00:38:11.692 --> 00:38:13.027
And I meant it.

633
00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:16.531
And if I have been
disrespectful in any way.

634
00:38:16.564 --> 00:38:17.632
then I apologize.

635
00:38:17.665 --> 00:38:18.900
- An apology?

636
00:38:18.933 --> 00:38:20.635
What am I supposed to do
with that?

637
00:38:21.669 --> 00:38:23.704
- Okay. I also--

638
00:38:23.738 --> 00:38:26.007
I got you a gift also.
by the way.

639
00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:27.875
- The watch?

640
00:38:29.577 --> 00:38:30.678
- Yeah. the...

641
00:38:30.711 --> 00:38:34.515
- This is what. um. $15.000?

642
00:38:34.549 --> 00:38:36.517
$17.000?

643
00:38:36.551 --> 00:38:37.985
- $32.000.

644
00:38:39.153 --> 00:38:42.389
- $32.000?

645
00:38:42.422 --> 00:38:45.893
You own 112 hotels.

646
00:38:45.927 --> 00:38:49.697
Your market cap
is $185 million.

647
00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:53.534
What is $32.000
compared to what you have?

648
00:38:53.568 --> 00:38:54.702
You want to talk about

649
00:38:54.735 --> 00:38:56.637
matching up your insides
to your outsides?

650
00:38:56.671 --> 00:38:57.905
Do you want to talk about

651
00:38:57.939 --> 00:38:59.674
who around here knows
what it takes to win?

652
00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:04.612
- Okay. what do you want?

653
00:39:04.645 --> 00:39:07.380
- I want what I'm worth
relative to what you have.

654
00:39:07.414 --> 00:39:08.749
A real number.

655
00:39:08.783 --> 00:39:10.685
- I don't--what does that mean?

656
00:39:10.718 --> 00:39:11.953
- Half.
- Half?

657
00:39:11.986 --> 00:39:13.420
- Half of the salary
for the first year

658
00:39:13.453 --> 00:39:14.454
of the job that I got you.

659
00:39:14.487 --> 00:39:15.890
You how much is that?

660
00:39:15.923 --> 00:39:17.725
- That's. like. $4 million.

661
00:39:18.926 --> 00:39:21.028
- Okay. good.
- Oh. is that good?

662
00:39:21.062 --> 00:39:22.730
You're insane.

663
00:39:23.598 --> 00:39:25.432
- It's what I deserve.
- No. I'm not doing that.

664
00:39:25.465 --> 00:39:26.734
And I don't think I could
do that even if I wanted to.

665
00:39:26.767 --> 00:39:28.069
- Yes. you are.

666
00:39:28.102 --> 00:39:29.436
You are doing it.

667
00:39:29.469 --> 00:39:31.572
- Or what. you fucking nutjob?

668
00:39:31.606 --> 00:39:34.609
- Or I'll tell.

669
00:39:45.485 --> 00:39:48.956
- Okay.

670
00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:50.490
Like. can we just slow down
for a second?

671
00:39:50.524 --> 00:39:51.525
- I'm dead serious.

672
00:39:51.559 --> 00:39:52.627
- I can see that.

673
00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:53.928
- So what's your answer?

674
00:39:53.961 --> 00:39:55.428
- What. to your offer
of blackmail?

675
00:39:55.462 --> 00:39:56.163
I'm gonna pass.

676
00:39:57.965 --> 00:39:59.100
- People are watching
your company right now.

677
00:39:59.133 --> 00:40:00.768
This transition.
it would be a story.

678

"Heir to hotel fortune

have to do with each other?

Well. I mean.

it makes it sound weird.

00:40:43.277 --> 00:40:44.712
- Why are you smiling?

699
00:40:44.745 --> 00:40:46.981
- Because this isn't the 1990s.

700
00:40:47.014 --> 00:40:49.250
and no one cares
what I do with my money

701

00:40:52.687 --> 00:40:55.723
If anything. it's gonna make me
seem open-minded and clued in

703
00:40:55.756 --> 00:40:58.993
and fucking cool.

704
00:40:59.026 --> 00:41:00.995
- The board is gonna think
this is cool?

705
00:41:01.028 --> 00:41:02.163
- It doesn't matter
what the board thinks.

706
00:41:02.196 --> 00:41:03.764
- Ha!
- It's set up already.

707
00:41:03.798 --> 00:41:05.066
- I knew it. you fucking idiot.

708
00:41:05.099 --> 00:41:06.968
You said that
you didn't have a board.

709
00:41:07.001 --> 00:41:09.103
You said that's not how
you're structured.

710
00:41:09.136 --> 00:41:10.805
- No. what I--what I meant
was we have a--

711
00:41:10.838 --> 00:41:12.506
- No. I know what you meant.

712
00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:13.708
I know what you meant.

713
00:41:13.741 --> 00:41:14.842
You wanted me to feel stupid

714
00:41:14.875 --> 00:41:16.844
and out of my depth.
but I'm not.

715
00:41:16.877 --> 00:41:19.714
So this board. which exists.

716
00:41:19.747 --> 00:41:21.282
do they know
your company's motto?

717
00:41:21.315 --> 00:41:22.850
- Do they what?

718
00:41:22.883 --> 00:41:24.585
- Do you know
your company's motto?

719
00:41:24.618 --> 00:41:25.853
- Uh. yes.

720
00:41:25.886 --> 00:41:26.988
"Some things never change."

721
00:41:27.021 --> 00:41:30.992
Some things never change.

722
00:41:31.025 --> 00:41:34.628
Nothing weird.
nothing unexpected

723
00:41:34.662 --> 00:41:37.164
is gonna happen here.

724
00:41:37.198 --> 00:41:39.533
So how is that gonna square
with you paying

725
00:41:39.567 --> 00:41:41.869
for degenerate no-contact sex?

726
00:41:41.902 --> 00:41:44.038
- So I'll change the motto.

727
00:41:44.071 --> 00:41:45.973
- Mm. change the motto
"Some things never change."

728
00:41:46.007 --> 00:41:47.308
- Yes. and I promise.

729
00:41:47.341 --> 00:41:49.643
no one on the board
is gonna say a thing.

730
00:41:49.677 --> 00:41:51.178
- Fine.

731
00:41:51.212 --> 00:41:53.114
Do you want to settle this
really quickly?

732
00:41:53.147 --> 00:41:54.548
You don't care
what anybody thinks.

733
00:41:54.582 --> 00:41:55.683
and I can tell anybody
that I would like to?

734
00:41:55.716 --> 00:41:57.184
- That's right.
- Okay.

735
00:41:57.218 --> 00:41:57.818
So then let's send a video
of what we do here

736
00:41:57.852 --> 00:41:59.553
to everybody on the board.

737
00:42:00.755 --> 00:42:02.757
- That's. um...

738
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:04.558
not how blackmail works.

739
00:42:04.592 --> 00:42:06.560
- No?
- No.

740
00:42:06.594 --> 00:42:07.928
You don't ask for money

741
00:42:07.962 --> 00:42:09.730
and then propose to make
a dirty video.

742
00:42:09.764 --> 00:42:10.898
You want to try to go ahead

743
00:42:10.931 --> 00:42:12.800
and make that
dirty video first.

744
00:42:14.802 --> 00:42:16.003
Hi. I'm not quite done.

745
00:42:16.037 --> 00:42:17.338
Can we talk about this
in a little bit?

746
00:42:17.371 --> 00:42:19.774
It's just something.

747
00:42:19.807 --> 00:42:20.674
I'm not being difficult.

748
00:42:20.708 --> 00:42:21.675
I told you already.

749
00:42:21.709 --> 00:42:22.910
Something came up.

750
00:42:56.143 --> 00:42:58.712
No. because I just don't see
the urgency in it.

751
00:43:01.248 --> 00:43:02.283
- Hal.

752
00:43:05.019 --> 00:43:07.288
That's what I did.

753
00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:11.759
I already made a video.

754
00:43:18.899 --> 00:43:20.868
- I'm saying no.

755
00:43:20.901 --> 00:43:22.303
Hey. can you listen to me?

756
00:43:22.336 --> 00:43:24.972
I trust your opinion.
and I trust your taste.

757
00:43:25.005 --> 00:43:27.174
So. you know.
if you like the cake.

758
00:43:27.208 --> 00:43:29.210
then obviously.
I'm gonna like it too.

759
00:43:29.243 --> 00:43:30.778
- There's a camera hidden
in this hotel suite.

760
00:43:30.811 --> 00:43:33.080
and I have hours of footage.

761
00:43:33.114 --> 00:43:34.849
You can hear what we're saying.

762
00:43:34.882 --> 00:43:37.017
You can see your face.

763
00:43:38.018 --> 00:43:39.120
You can see everything.

764
00:43:40.421 --> 00:43:42.022
- Uh...

765
00:43:42.056 --> 00:43:42.823
- She really should know.
She ought to know

766
00:43:42.857 --> 00:43:44.258
what kind of man
she's marrying.

767
00:43:44.291 --> 00:43:46.694
- Oh. Mom. will you please
just listen to me?

768
00:43:46.727 --> 00:43:48.095
All I'm saying is I just need
a couple minutes.

769
00:43:48.129 --> 00:43:49.029
and then we can talk about it.

770
00:43:49.063 --> 00:43:50.164
- It's your mother.

771
00:43:50.197 --> 00:43:52.333
- Okay.
Well. I'm sorry I yelled.

772
00:43:52.366 --> 00:43:53.667
I just needed--

773
00:43:53.701 --> 00:43:55.035
okay.

774
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:57.838
Yes. Bye.

775
00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:03.744
It's a. um. dinner for my. uh--

776
00:44:03.777 --> 00:44:05.079
- Your ascension.

777
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:10.751
What do you think
she's gonna say

778
00:44:10.784 --> 00:44:12.186
when she sees it?

779
00:44:16.423 --> 00:44:17.925
- You're a fucking liar.

780
00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:21.362
- I'm not.

781
00:44:26.734 --> 00:44:28.903
- Tell me you're kidding.

782
00:44:30.938 --> 00:44:32.706
You hid a camera in here?

783
00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:41.749
You filmed our sessions
secretly?

784
00:45:16.016 --> 00:45:17.851
- Show me the camera.

785
00:45:21.488 --> 00:45:23.857
Rebecca...

786
00:45:23.891 --> 00:45:26.327
Where is the fucking camera?

787
00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:28.996
- If you want to see it so bad.
then fucking find it.

788
00:45:44.445 --> 00:45:45.913
- Cold.

789
00:45:50.417 --> 00:45:52.419
- I said cold.

790
00:45:58.959 --> 00:46:00.494
- Hey. Hal.
do you not understand

791
00:46:00.528 --> 00:46:01.895
how this game works?

792
00:46:08.503 --> 00:46:09.571
- Whoo!

793
00:46:21.215 --> 00:46:22.550
- There we go.

794
00:46:23.851 --> 00:46:25.352
- There we go. Warmer.

795
00:46:29.056 --> 00:46:30.558
- Warmer.

796
00:46:30.592 --> 00:46:33.093
You're warming up now.

797
00:46:44.071 --> 00:46:45.172
- What are you doing?

798
00:46:45.205 --> 00:46:46.373
You're losing momentum.

799
00:46:46.407 --> 00:46:47.975
Weather's not changing.
my friend.

800
00:46:49.443 --> 00:46:51.345
- Warmer.

801
00:46:51.378 --> 00:46:53.548
The sun is up.

802
00:46:53.581 --> 00:46:55.382
Can you feel it?

803
00:47:01.121 --> 00:47:02.289
- I'm not sure how
there'd be a camera in there.

804
00:47:02.323 --> 00:47:04.526
but I like your energy.

805
00:47:04.559 --> 00:47:05.893
Okay.

806
00:47:05.926 --> 00:47:07.428
Back to the lamp idea.

807
00:47:07.461 --> 00:47:08.630
Warmer-ish.

808
00:47:08.663 --> 00:47:10.397
Whoo!

809
00:47:12.032 --> 00:47:16.403
- Hal. imagine how satisfied
that board is gonna be.

810
00:47:16.437 --> 00:47:18.906
Everything that
they suspected about you.

811
00:47:18.939 --> 00:47:20.608
it's true.

812
00:47:20.642 --> 00:47:21.609
You're a fuckup.

813
00:47:21.643 --> 00:47:22.976
You're a clown.

814
00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:24.144
- Yeah.

815
00:47:24.178 --> 00:47:26.246
But I'll still be me.

816
00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:28.148
and you'll still be you.

817
00:47:28.182 --> 00:47:29.983
doing your own laundry.

818
00:47:30.017 --> 00:47:32.953
on your knees.
scrubbing your own toilet.

819
00:47:32.986 --> 00:47:35.657
Sunday nights in the bathtub
eating vegan ice cream

820
00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:39.426
because you're fucking
lactose intolerant.

821
00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:40.928
- Colder.

822
00:47:43.598 --> 00:47:45.466
- TV.
That's gotta be it. right?

823
00:47:48.603 --> 00:47:50.471
- You're right.

824
00:47:50.505 --> 00:47:54.308
I do scrub my own toilet.
and I don't like it.

825
00:47:54.341 --> 00:47:55.610
But you want to know
what the real difference

826
00:47:55.643 --> 00:47:57.077
between me and you is?

827
00:47:57.111 --> 00:47:59.446
- Yeah. I just told you.
you crazy bitch.

828
00:48:06.387 --> 00:48:09.223
It's embarrassing
not having any money.

829
00:48:09.256 --> 00:48:12.527
but it's more embarrassing
when you do have everything.

830
00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:15.429
like you do.
and you still feel like trash.

831
00:48:15.462 --> 00:48:17.565
and you still feel ashamed.

832
00:48:17.599 --> 00:48:19.400
because you just know.
to a certain degree

833
00:48:19.433 --> 00:48:22.570
that whatever it is that
some men have. that magic.

834
00:48:22.604 --> 00:48:28.342
your whole life has been proof
that you don't have it.

835
00:48:34.281 --> 00:48:36.684
Break in the clouds.

836
00:48:36.718 --> 00:48:39.319
The sun. she's shining again.

837
00:48:39.353 --> 00:48:41.656
White hot. White hot.

838
00:48:41.689 --> 00:48:43.223
- Ah. fuck.

839
00:48:43.257 --> 00:48:44.358
- Blazing hot.

840
00:48:44.391 --> 00:48:47.494
- Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

841
00:48:47.529 --> 00:48:48.730
- You see how hot?

842
00:48:51.031 --> 00:48:52.366
The commitment and the focus.

843
00:48:52.399 --> 00:48:54.234
- Where is it?

844
00:48:54.268 --> 00:48:55.235
- So close!

845
00:48:55.269 --> 00:48:56.370
I swear to God!

846
00:48:59.541 --> 00:49:01.609
Uh. uh. uh. Mm-mm. Colder now.

847
00:49:01.643 --> 00:49:02.744
- How can I be colder?

848
00:49:02.777 --> 00:49:05.379
It's a hole in the wall!

849
00:49:05.412 --> 00:49:07.214
- I meant that
you were on the right track

850
00:49:07.247 --> 00:49:08.282
philosophically.

851
00:49:08.315 --> 00:49:09.717
- What the fuck does that mean?

852
00:49:09.751 --> 00:49:11.553
Oh. fuck.

853
00:49:11.586 --> 00:49:13.454
Hal?

854
00:49:25.032 --> 00:49:27.569
- You're fucking with me.
right?

855
00:49:27.602 --> 00:49:29.436
Please just tell me.

856
00:49:32.306 --> 00:49:33.407
- No.

857
00:49:37.344 --> 00:49:39.581
I don't think it's worth
getting killed over.

858
00:49:42.483 --> 00:49:44.151
But no.
I'm not fucking with you.

859
00:49:44.184 --> 00:49:45.753
I'm sorry. baby.

860
00:49:49.122 --> 00:49:51.425
- Why are you doing this to me?

861
00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:54.995
- Hal.

862
00:49:56.463 --> 00:49:57.632
- What?

863
00:50:00.502 --> 00:50:01.736
- You're hard right now.

864
00:50:04.171 --> 00:50:05.138
- No.

865
00:50:05.172 --> 00:50:07.107
No.

866
00:50:09.844 --> 00:50:12.012
- I can see it. Hal.

867
00:50:15.550 --> 00:50:17.752
- Please just stop.

868
00:50:17.785 --> 00:50:21.689
- How can you possibly
be hard right now?

869
00:50:21.723 --> 00:50:25.158
I mean. what the fuck
is wrong with you?

870
00:50:35.135 --> 00:50:36.738
You love this.

871
00:50:41.509 --> 00:50:43.811
- I know that you think

872
00:50:43.845 --> 00:50:46.748
I'm. like.
this harmless little bitch.

873
00:50:49.483 --> 00:50:51.786
But if I wanted to.

874
00:50:51.819 --> 00:50:54.454
I can get rid of you.

875
00:50:54.488 --> 00:50:56.256
It's easy as that.

876
00:51:01.228 --> 00:51:03.831
- Well. you're right there.

877
00:51:05.767 --> 00:51:09.369
I do think
you're a harmless bitch.

878
00:52:00.588 --> 00:52:03.290
You think it's all cute.

879
00:52:03.323 --> 00:52:04.792
You think you're my friend.

880
00:52:07.795 --> 00:52:09.429
You're not my friend.

881
00:52:11.498 --> 00:52:13.801
You're trash.

882
00:52:13.835 --> 00:52:17.471
You mean nothing to me.

883
00:52:20.374 --> 00:52:26.346
And I will make you regret
treating me like this.

884
00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:31.519
because the truth is.
it is easy to get rid of you.

885
00:52:34.321 --> 00:52:36.289
It would cost less
than that watch.

886
00:52:42.262 --> 00:52:43.631
- Okay.

887
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.602
- What does that mean. "Okay"?

888
00:52:49.937 --> 00:52:51.773
- It means I was lying.

889
00:52:53.908 --> 00:52:55.409
There's no video.

890
00:53:05.419 --> 00:53:07.387
Okay.

891
00:53:07.421 --> 00:53:08.823
Good.

892
00:53:10.257 --> 00:53:11.592
That's what I thought.

893
00:53:15.663 --> 00:53:18.833
Now get the fuck out of here.

894
00:53:35.783 --> 00:53:40.855
Just to be clear
about something.

895
00:53:40.888 --> 00:53:43.191
you didn't teach me anything.

896
00:53:45.526 --> 00:53:48.529
I wrote the scenes.

897
00:53:48.563 --> 00:53:50.665
You just said the words.

898
00:53:54.035 --> 00:53:56.571
It could have been anybody.

899
00:54:20.528 --> 00:54:21.929
- You're wrong.

900
00:54:24.532 --> 00:54:25.733
The words don't matter.
They help.

901
00:54:25.767 --> 00:54:27.502
They're like wallpaper
or decoration.

902
00:54:27.535 --> 00:54:29.469
They're nice. but they're not
what's really going on.

903
00:54:29.504 --> 00:54:30.738
- Okay.

904
00:54:30.772 --> 00:54:33.641
So then tell me
what is going on.

905
00:54:33.674 --> 00:54:34.876
- You want to be reprimanded

906
00:54:34.909 --> 00:54:36.711
for what you fear
are inherent flaws

907
00:54:36.744 --> 00:54:39.446
and then rewarded
for coming into compliance.

908
00:54:39.479 --> 00:54:40.915
- If you say so.

909
00:55:03.704 --> 00:55:07.374
I pledge allegiance...

910
00:55:08.576 --> 00:55:11.378
To the flag...

911
00:55:11.411 --> 00:55:12.680
- This is funny.

912
00:55:12.713 --> 00:55:17.350
- Of the United States
of America...

913
00:55:20.387 --> 00:55:24.659
And to the republic

914
00:55:24.692 --> 00:55:29.597
for which it stands.

915
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:34.101
one nation under God...

916
00:55:49.416 --> 00:55:53.888
Indivisible.

917
00:55:53.921 --> 00:56:00.828
with liberty
and justice for all.

918
00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:08.035
You are good at what you do.

919
00:56:10.805 --> 00:56:13.941
But that doesn't change
the nature of our relationship.

920
00:56:16.110 --> 00:56:20.715
I pay you to make me feel
a certain way.

921
00:56:20.748 --> 00:56:23.450
I--I do it.

922
00:56:23.483 --> 00:56:25.887
And if I stop wanting
to feel that way.

923
00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:30.057
then I stop paying you.
and I don't.

924
00:56:30.091 --> 00:56:31.424
It's up to me.

925
00:56:37.665 --> 00:56:40.433
- Take off your pants.

926
00:56:43.070 --> 00:56:44.471
- No.

927
00:56:46.707 --> 00:56:51.012
- Take off your pants...

928
00:56:51.045 --> 00:56:54.949
so I don't have to keep
punishing you.

929
00:56:57.118 --> 00:57:02.523
- And I am saying no.

930
00:57:02.556 --> 00:57:03.858
- Stop me.

931
00:57:03.891 --> 00:57:05.192
- You're holding a knife
to my neck.

932
00:57:05.226 --> 00:57:06.493
- Okay.

933
00:57:06.527 --> 00:57:07.795
So take it.

934
00:57:07.828 --> 00:57:09.864
Take this knife.

935
00:57:09.897 --> 00:57:11.532
You're stronger than I am.
Take it.

936
00:57:11.565 --> 00:57:13.167
Tie me up. Come on. please.

937
00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:14.735
- I should.

938
00:57:17.171 --> 00:57:18.706
- How about this?

939
00:57:21.042 --> 00:57:23.010
Just say to me that
you don't care what I want

940
00:57:23.044 --> 00:57:25.680
and that it's not the most
important thing to you.

941
00:57:28.182 --> 00:57:29.784
Say that. and I'll stop.

942
00:57:43.965 --> 00:57:46.267
Pull down your pants.

943
00:58:05.786 --> 00:58:08.289
It's the only
good thing about you.

944
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:20.735
I'm going to use this...

945
00:58:20.768 --> 00:58:23.204
because it belongs to me.

946
00:58:26.107 --> 00:58:28.242
- And you...

947
00:58:28.275 --> 00:58:33.214
are going to be quiet
and cooperate.

948
00:58:41.655 --> 00:58:43.090
- You know.
you say all this shit to me.

949
00:58:43.124 --> 00:58:46.727
what kind of a person I am.

950
00:58:46.761 --> 00:58:48.863
but you're a bad person too.

951
00:58:50.364 --> 00:58:53.200
You're fucking evil.

952
00:58:58.272 --> 00:59:01.909
- When I tell you.

953
00:59:01.942 --> 00:59:04.311
Not before.

954
00:59:06.847 --> 00:59:09.750
You're gonna come inside me.

955
00:59:12.019 --> 00:59:15.256
But I want to tell you
something first.

956
00:59:17.691 --> 00:59:21.095
I have an app on my phone.

957
00:59:21.128 --> 00:59:23.764
and it tells me
when I'm ovulating.

958
00:59:27.334 --> 00:59:29.637
I'm ovulating right now.

959
00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:37.011
And when I tell you to come.

960
00:59:37.044 --> 00:59:40.314
you're gonna come inside me.

961
00:59:40.347 --> 00:59:44.985
You're gonna do it.

962
00:59:45.019 --> 00:59:47.321
and you're gonna
make me pregnant.

963
00:59:50.057 --> 00:59:52.293
And I'm gonna have the baby.

964
00:59:54.295 --> 00:59:57.698
A boy.

965
00:59:57.731 --> 01:00:00.267
And every single night.

966
01:00:00.301 --> 01:00:04.171
you're gonna put him into bed.

967
01:00:04.205 --> 01:00:07.708
and he's gonna look up at you.

968
01:00:07.741 --> 01:00:09.743
and he's gonna smile.

969
01:00:11.345 --> 01:00:14.215
You're gonna thank me
for the life I've given you.

970
01:00:16.350 --> 01:00:18.652
Say that's what you want.

971
01:00:21.889 --> 01:00:23.824
Do it and I'll let you come.

972
01:00:27.161 --> 01:00:29.830
- I understand.
That's what I want.

973
01:00:31.866 --> 01:00:33.334
- Okay. you can come now.

974
01:01:10.505 --> 01:01:12.106
- I'll pay it.

975
01:01:15.209 --> 01:01:17.745
Half--

976
01:01:17.778 --> 01:01:19.780
half my salary
for the first year.

977
01:01:19.813 --> 01:01:22.049
and half my bonus.

978
01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:24.885
$6 million.

979
01:02:43.030 --> 01:02:44.164
- What are you doing?

980
01:02:44.198 --> 01:02:45.199
- I'm getting it set up.

981
01:02:45.232 --> 01:02:46.501
The lawyer has to do it.

982
01:02:50.538 --> 01:02:52.540
- "Hey. Gary. Weird ask.

983
01:02:52.574 --> 01:02:54.842
"Can you please deposit
$6 million

984
01:02:54.875 --> 01:02:55.543
into the following account?"

985
01:02:55.577 --> 01:02:57.545
Are you joking?

986
01:02:57.579 --> 01:02:58.979
- What?

987
01:02:59.013 --> 01:03:00.114
- You can't just wire it to me.
Hal.

988
01:03:00.147 --> 01:03:01.849
The IRS is gonna be living
at my house.

989
01:03:01.882 --> 01:03:03.551
- No. Gary will figure it out.
He's really good.

990
01:03:03.585 --> 01:03:06.220
- Here's what
you're gonna tell Gary.

991
01:03:06.253 --> 01:03:08.022
He's gonna set up two
corporations in the Caymans.

992
01:03:08.055 --> 01:03:09.156
one for you guys. one for me.

993
01:03:09.189 --> 01:03:10.224
You should be typing.

994
01:03:10.257 --> 01:03:12.092
- Okay.

995
01:03:12.126 --> 01:03:13.927
- He'll transfer the money
there quarterly

996
01:03:13.961 --> 01:03:15.396
in divisions under $1 million.

997
01:03:16.864 --> 01:03:18.165
Got it?

998
01:03:18.198 --> 01:03:20.067
- The Caymans.
That's a tax shelter. right?

999
01:03:25.372 --> 01:03:27.408
- Yeah.

1000
01:03:27.441 --> 01:03:29.410
Send that.

1001
01:03:29.443 --> 01:03:31.546
I know where to find you
if this Gary...

1002
01:03:31.579 --> 01:03:33.047
- Yes.
- Doesn't exist.

1003
01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:34.214
- You do.

1004
01:03:36.283 --> 01:03:39.621
- And what--
what you said before.

1005
01:03:39.654 --> 01:03:42.456
is that what you want?

1006
01:03:42.489 --> 01:03:45.459
To have a kid?

1007
01:03:45.492 --> 01:03:49.163
- Um. no.

1008
01:03:49.196 --> 01:03:51.398
I said that
because you were wrong

1009
01:03:51.432 --> 01:03:54.034
and I don't like
losing arguments.

1010
01:03:54.068 --> 01:03:55.402
- Oh.

1011
01:03:57.304 --> 01:03:59.239
- And I have endometriosis.

1012
01:03:59.273 --> 01:04:02.843
So it's very unlikely
I'll be able to have children.

1013
01:04:04.945 --> 01:04:06.080
- Oh.

1014
01:04:09.316 --> 01:04:11.151
- Have a good
rest of your weekend.

1015
01:04:11.185 --> 01:04:12.587
- Okay. you do the same.

1016
01:04:32.439 --> 01:04:34.341
- Hi.
I can't really talk right now.

1017
01:04:38.479 --> 01:04:39.480
Alexander.

1018
01:04:39.514 --> 01:04:41.348
Alexander. I can't hear you.

1019
01:04:43.050 --> 01:04:44.318
Because you're crying.

1020
01:04:46.521 --> 01:04:48.956
No.

1021
01:04:48.989 --> 01:04:50.457
No. there's nothing
that you can do.

1022
01:04:52.025 --> 01:04:55.429
You can call again
if that helps.

1023
01:04:55.462 --> 01:04:58.265
but this is the last time
that I'm gonna pick up. okay?

1024
01:04:58.298 --> 01:04:59.266
Goodbye.

1025
01:05:17.017 --> 01:05:18.520
- Hi.
- Hi.

1026
01:05:18.553 --> 01:05:21.088
- Um. I was--

1027
01:05:21.121 --> 01:05:23.558
I was thinking about
something that you said.

1028
01:05:23.591 --> 01:05:25.259
- I promise you. Hal.
I cannot get pregnant.

1029
01:05:25.292 --> 01:05:27.194
- No. not that.

1030
01:05:27.227 --> 01:05:30.364
You said that
you know where to find me.

1031
01:05:30.397 --> 01:05:32.266
- I do.

1032
01:05:32.299 --> 01:05:33.735
But you sent the email. right?

1033
01:05:33.768 --> 01:05:35.002
- Well. yeah.

1034
01:05:35.035 --> 01:05:36.604
But then it occurred to me.

1035
01:05:36.638 --> 01:05:41.375
what's to stop you
from just doing this again?

1036
01:05:41.408 --> 01:05:43.310
Like. what's to stop you

1037
01:05:43.343 --> 01:05:46.213
from coming back next month.
like--

1038
01:05:48.616 --> 01:05:51.251
- I guess you'll have to take
my word for it.

1039
01:05:51.285 --> 01:05:53.387
- Well. I was thinking that--

1040
01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:56.758
that I need. um.
something from you.

1041
01:05:56.791 --> 01:06:02.630
something equivalent
that can prevent you--

1042
01:06:02.664 --> 01:06:04.298
- Collateral.
- Yes. collateral.

1043
01:06:04.331 --> 01:06:05.332
Exactly.

1044
01:06:05.365 --> 01:06:09.069
Um. collateral.

1045
01:06:09.102 --> 01:06:10.337
Yes. something solid.

1046
01:06:10.370 --> 01:06:12.507
Something important to you.

1047
01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:13.641
- I get what you mean. Hal.
- Okay.

1048
01:06:13.675 --> 01:06:15.409
- But you already sent
the email. right?

1049
01:06:15.442 --> 01:06:17.010
- I'll--so?
I'll send another one.

1050
01:06:17.044 --> 01:06:18.646
I'll say. "Please disregard."
He doesn't care.

1051
01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:20.314
- What happened to all your
smug money confidence?

1052
01:06:20.347 --> 01:06:21.616
Didn't seem like
this even mattered to you.

1053
01:06:21.649 --> 01:06:23.484
- It didn't.
and then it occurred to me

1054
01:06:23.518 --> 01:06:25.787
that you can do this again
and again and again for years.

1055
01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:27.054
and then I have to see--

1056
01:06:27.087 --> 01:06:30.023
um. go over this
again and again.

1057
01:06:30.057 --> 01:06:32.125
and I'm not prepared
to do that.

1058
01:06:35.128 --> 01:06:37.264
- To see me again?

1059
01:06:37.297 --> 01:06:38.298
- Hey.

1060
01:06:38.332 --> 01:06:39.299
No. it's not personal.

1061
01:06:39.333 --> 01:06:40.467
I mean. it's like a--

1062
01:06:40.502 --> 01:06:42.269
financially.
it's a little insane.

1063
01:06:42.302 --> 01:06:44.137
- Okay. so here's the new deal.
Fuck your collateral.

1064
01:06:44.171 --> 01:06:45.405
- What?
- Fuck your collateral.

1065
01:06:45.439 --> 01:06:47.207
- Hold on.
- And no.

1066
01:06:47.241 --> 01:06:49.176
I give you no assurance that
I won't be doing this again.

1067
01:06:49.209 --> 01:06:51.646
- Rebecca.
- In fact. if I were you--

1068
01:06:51.679 --> 01:06:53.080
- We need to talk seriously.

1069
01:06:53.113 --> 01:06:54.081
- Oh. I'm being serious.

1070
01:06:54.114 --> 01:06:55.115
- Okay? Please?

1071
01:06:55.148 --> 01:06:56.316
- I give you no assurance.

1072
01:06:56.350 --> 01:06:57.519
And if I were you.
I would start thinking

1073
01:06:57.552 --> 01:06:59.086
about ways to keep me happy.

1074
01:06:59.119 --> 01:07:00.655
like. in perpetuity

1075
01:07:00.688 --> 01:07:02.356
if dealing with me
is so disgusting too you.

1076
01:07:02.389 --> 01:07:05.292
- No--what does that mean.
perpetuity?

1077
01:07:05.325 --> 01:07:06.360
- It means forever. Hal.

1078
01:07:06.393 --> 01:07:07.394
- Yeah. I know.

1079
01:07:07.427 --> 01:07:08.663
I mean. what do you mean?

1080
01:07:08.696 --> 01:07:11.365
- Oh. okay.
See. I'm not the writer.

1081
01:07:11.398 --> 01:07:12.667
So you might have to do
some thinking on your own.

1082
01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:14.368
But off the top of my head.

1083
01:07:14.401 --> 01:07:18.506
it's something like a position.

1084
01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:20.307
- A posi--a position?

1085
01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:21.509
- A position. yeah.
- What?

1086
01:07:21.543 --> 01:07:22.844
- At the company.
Good salary.

1087
01:07:22.877 --> 01:07:23.811
- No.
- Good benefits.

1088
01:07:23.845 --> 01:07:25.178
Reasonably sized staff.
- What?

1089
01:07:25.212 --> 01:07:26.380
- Office near yours.
- No.

1090
01:07:26.413 --> 01:07:28.482
We--we are not talking
about that.

1091
01:07:28.516 --> 01:07:30.117
- Well. that's
what I'm talking about.

1092
01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:31.218
and that is the only thing
that matters.

1093
01:07:31.251 --> 01:07:32.554
- Hey. Hold on.

1094
01:07:32.587 --> 01:07:33.688
- You can think it over
and come back to me.

1095
01:07:33.721 --> 01:07:34.622
It can be a discussion.
- I'm sorry.

1096
01:07:34.656 --> 01:07:36.156
Whoa. No.

1097
01:07:36.189 --> 01:07:37.391
Stop. Time out.

1098
01:07:37.424 --> 01:07:38.793
Go back. Okay?

1099
01:07:38.826 --> 01:07:39.861
Let's go back.

1100
01:07:39.894 --> 01:07:40.795
We're gonna go back now.

1101
01:07:40.828 --> 01:07:43.731
Six--I'll give you
the $6 million. okay?

1102
01:07:43.765 --> 01:07:45.667
If. and only if.
you tell me one

1103
01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:47.367
damaging piece of information
about yourself.

1104
01:07:47.401 --> 01:07:48.402
- That whole thing has bloomed
and died. my friend.

1105
01:07:48.435 --> 01:07:49.571
- No. it hasn't!

1106
01:07:49.604 --> 01:07:51.104
- We are in
a whole new world now.

1107
01:07:51.138 --> 01:07:52.507
We are talking about
where. in relation to yours.

1108
01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:53.841
my office is going to be.
- No.

1109
01:07:53.875 --> 01:07:55.375
- And we need to start talking
about my title.

1110
01:07:55.409 --> 01:07:56.511
- What? No!

1111
01:07:56.544 --> 01:07:57.679
We are not talking about that.

1112
01:07:57.712 --> 01:07:59.179
Are you insane?

1113
01:07:59.212 --> 01:08:00.715
- Would it be weird
if we were co-CEOs?

1114
01:08:00.748 --> 01:08:02.449
- Yes.
- Has anybody done that?

1115
01:08:02.482 --> 01:08:03.885
- No. No.

1116
01:08:03.918 --> 01:08:05.653
We are not doing that.

1117
01:08:05.687 --> 01:08:07.722
- Well. maybe we're not doing
exactly that.

1118
01:08:07.755 --> 01:08:09.557
but we are doing
something like that.

1119
01:08:09.591 --> 01:08:10.558
- No. No.
- Yes.

1120
01:08:10.592 --> 01:08:11.726
- No.
- Yes.

1121
01:08:11.759 --> 01:08:12.794
That's the result of you
coming out here

1122
01:08:12.827 --> 01:08:13.828
and opening
your wormy little mouth

1123
01:08:13.861 --> 01:08:14.662
trying to extract...
- Shut up.

1124
01:08:14.696 --> 01:08:15.530
- Some concession when...
- Shut--

1125
01:08:15.563 --> 01:08:16.898
- You have zero leverage!
- Shut up.

1126
01:08:16.931 --> 01:08:17.899
Come here.
- Ow!

1127
01:08:17.932 --> 01:08:19.299
Stop it. you fucking clod!

1128
01:08:19.333 --> 01:08:20.400
- I just want to talk.

1129
01:08:20.434 --> 01:08:21.569
- Rape!

1130
01:08:21.603 --> 01:08:23.170
- Just go back in the room.
- Rape!

1131
01:08:23.203 --> 01:08:24.304
Somebody help me!
I'm being raped!

1132
01:08:24.338 --> 01:08:25.873
Oh. my God.

1133
01:08:25.907 --> 01:08:28.275
Ow! Rape!

1134
01:08:28.308 --> 01:08:30.377
- What the fuck are you doing?

1135
01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:31.445
- Do you think
anybody called the cops?

1136
01:08:31.478 --> 01:08:32.379
I was really screaming
out there.

1137
01:08:32.412 --> 01:08:33.380
- Look. all I want to do

1138
01:08:33.413 --> 01:08:34.549
is just figure out a way

1139
01:08:34.582 --> 01:08:35.717
that we can end this
so that we both

1140
01:08:35.750 --> 01:08:36.751
can be sure that it is over.
- Okay.

1141
01:08:36.784 --> 01:08:37.919
- That is all I want.
- Okay.

1142
01:08:37.952 --> 01:08:39.219
Okay. Okay.

1143
01:08:39.252 --> 01:08:40.287
I told you. I need security.

1144
01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:41.455
I need a position
at the company.

1145
01:08:41.488 --> 01:08:42.757
- Are you insane?

1146
01:08:42.790 --> 01:08:44.424
Are you insane?

1147
01:08:44.458 --> 01:08:45.459
Oh. my God!

1148
01:08:45.492 --> 01:08:46.894
I don't know what you're doing!

1149
01:08:48.896 --> 01:08:51.666
- I'm fighting. Hal.

1150
01:08:51.699 --> 01:08:54.636
It's how you win something.
in case you were wondering.

1151
01:08:58.606 --> 01:08:59.741
So what?

1152
01:09:01.542 --> 01:09:02.810
You're not gonna give me a job?

1153
01:09:02.844 --> 01:09:03.811
- No.

1154
01:09:03.845 --> 01:09:05.379
Yes. correct.

1155
01:09:08.983 --> 01:09:10.818
Rebecca.
- Mm-hmm.

1156
01:09:10.852 --> 01:09:12.520
Rebecca.

1157
01:09:12.553 --> 01:09:16.691
- Hey. @porterfieldhotels.

1158
01:09:16.724 --> 01:09:18.526
is this your new CEO?

1159
01:09:18.559 --> 01:09:20.561
- What are you doing?

1160
01:09:20.595 --> 01:09:22.697
- Tweeting the video.

1161
01:09:22.730 --> 01:09:23.497
- Oh. my God.

1162
01:09:23.531 --> 01:09:25.533
There is no video!

1163
01:09:25.566 --> 01:09:26.567
There is no camera!

1164
01:09:26.601 --> 01:09:28.670
You told me that!

1165
01:09:28.703 --> 01:09:30.203
- I lied.

1166
01:09:39.379 --> 01:09:40.948
- Why did you do this?

1167
01:09:43.584 --> 01:09:46.854
- You wouldn't believe me.

1168
01:09:46.888 --> 01:09:51.358
- I trusted you
with everything about me.

1169
01:10:32.567 --> 01:10:34.301
Get up already.

1170
01:10:40.041 --> 01:10:41.542
I knew you were like this.

1171
01:10:41.576 --> 01:10:44.311
you fucking limp
pent-up serial killer!

1172
01:10:44.344 --> 01:10:45.345
- Fuck.

1173
01:10:45.378 --> 01:10:46.647
What's the code?

1174
01:10:46.681 --> 01:10:49.382
- Fuck you. Ted Bundy.

1175
01:10:49.416 --> 01:10:50.685
- Rebecca. what is the code?

1176
01:10:50.718 --> 01:10:52.720
- Bill Clinton piece of shit.

1177
01:10:52.754 --> 01:10:54.021
- Look at it. Rebecca.

1178
01:10:54.055 --> 01:10:56.490
Rebecca. look at it.

1179
01:10:57.859 --> 01:10:59.392
Fuck!

1180
01:11:03.363 --> 01:11:05.967
You are putting me in
an impossible situation.

1181
01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.401
You are making it impossible
for me and you

1182
01:11:08.435 --> 01:11:12.073
to walk out of here.
which is what I want.

1183
01:11:12.106 --> 01:11:14.776
- What are you trying to say?
- I don't know.

1184
01:11:14.809 --> 01:11:16.911
The people I work with.
my family. my mother.

1185
01:11:16.944 --> 01:11:19.312
they--they just cannot see
that video.

1186
01:11:19.346 --> 01:11:20.882
Okay?

1187
01:11:20.915 --> 01:11:22.784
- Why are you so scared
of them?

1188
01:11:22.817 --> 01:11:24.752
- Because they don't know me!

1189
01:11:24.786 --> 01:11:26.453
This is supposed to be mine.

1190
01:11:26.486 --> 01:11:29.590
the only thing that is actually
mine. God damn it!

1191
01:11:29.624 --> 01:11:30.992
I offered you money.

1192
01:11:31.025 --> 01:11:33.326
more than you can make
in two lifetimes.

1193
01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.996
I got you a gift.

1194
01:11:35.029 --> 01:11:38.065
What do you want?
What do you want?

1195
01:11:38.099 --> 01:11:40.968
Do you want to be CEO
of a hotel company?

1196
01:11:43.805 --> 01:11:44.806
- No.

1197
01:11:47.008 --> 01:11:49.610
- Okay. please--please.

1198
01:11:49.644 --> 01:11:52.613
then God. just tell me.

1199
01:11:52.647 --> 01:11:53.446
Do you want me to beg?

1200
01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:55.448
I will beg you.

1201
01:11:55.482 --> 01:12:00.721
Please. do not ruin
my intolerable. pointless life.

1202
01:12:00.755 --> 01:12:04.491
Just take your money
and just leave me to it.

1203
01:12:04.525 --> 01:12:06.393
Okay?

1204
01:12:06.426 --> 01:12:07.662
I don't--do you even know
why you're doing this.

1205
01:12:07.695 --> 01:12:09.130
or is this just the game?

1206
01:12:09.163 --> 01:12:10.531
- Yes.

1207
01:12:10.565 --> 01:12:11.464
- Which one?

1208
01:12:11.498 --> 01:12:13.634
Which is it?

1209
01:12:13.668 --> 01:12:15.736
- I know what I want.

1210
01:12:18.405 --> 01:12:20.675
I want to play this game.

1211
01:12:21.408 --> 01:12:23.476
- I don't--I don't understand.

1212
01:12:26.479 --> 01:12:28.481
- I quit my job.

1213
01:12:30.051 --> 01:12:32.720
- What job?

1214
01:12:32.753 --> 01:12:34.989
- I quit this job. dominating.

1215
01:12:36.557 --> 01:12:37.825
I fired my broker.

1216
01:12:37.859 --> 01:12:38.926
I haven't seen a client
in months.

1217
01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:40.995
I'm living off of my savings.

1218
01:12:41.028 --> 01:12:43.496
- Why?

1219
01:12:43.531 --> 01:12:45.398
- It felt disloyal.

1220
01:12:47.602 --> 01:12:48.836
- Disloyal to who?

1221
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:51.639
To me?

1222
01:12:51.672 --> 01:12:52.940
- I had a fiancé. Alexander.

1223
01:12:52.974 --> 01:12:54.542
I ended it.
I broke up with him.

1224
01:12:54.575 --> 01:12:55.676
He's fucking furious.

1225
01:12:55.710 --> 01:12:57.044
He has no idea.

1226
01:12:57.078 --> 01:12:59.647
- Because you felt
disloyal to me?

1227
01:13:01.916 --> 01:13:04.919
- Yes.

1228
01:13:04.952 --> 01:13:06.453
To us.

1229
01:13:06.486 --> 01:13:08.923
To--to what we do here.

1230
01:13:08.956 --> 01:13:10.925
I'm sorry. okay?
I know. I get it.

1231
01:13:10.958 --> 01:13:12.593
You want me to be in charge.
- Stop.

1232
01:13:12.627 --> 01:13:13.995
- I know this is painful
for you.

1233
01:13:16.097 --> 01:13:19.466
Hal. after our first session...
- Please.

1234
01:13:19.499 --> 01:13:20.935
- Do you remember you had me...
- Stop.

1235
01:13:20.968 --> 01:13:22.637
- Do the thing with
the fucking cuticle clippers?

1236
01:13:22.670 --> 01:13:24.437
I went home
and I couldn't sleep.

1237
01:13:24.471 --> 01:13:26.207
I couldn't sleep all night.

1238
01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:28.209
I was shining.

1239
01:13:28.242 --> 01:13:29.710
And then you called me again

1240
01:13:29.744 --> 01:13:30.778
and I got
that very same feeling.

1241
01:13:30.811 --> 01:13:31.746
like when you win something.

1242
01:13:31.779 --> 01:13:33.080
like you just know

1243
01:13:33.114 --> 01:13:35.082
that you're gonna get
what you want.

1244
01:13:35.116 --> 01:13:36.784
I thought it would go away.
I did.

1245
01:13:36.817 --> 01:13:37.752
I thought it would go away.

1246
01:13:37.785 --> 01:13:38.753
But it didn't.

1247
01:13:38.786 --> 01:13:40.955
It got worse and worse.

1248
01:13:40.988 --> 01:13:42.455
Why do you think that I started
taping the sessions?

1249
01:13:42.489 --> 01:13:43.891
It was for me.

1250
01:13:43.925 --> 01:13:45.593
- Stop.
- So that I could have them.

1251
01:13:47.662 --> 01:13:50.731
We're suited
to each other. Hal.

1252
01:13:50.765 --> 01:13:56.137
What we do here. what happens.

1253
01:13:56.170 --> 01:13:59.073
it's magic.

1254
01:13:59.106 --> 01:14:00.241
- No.

1255
01:14:00.274 --> 01:14:02.475
No. No.

1256
01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:03.844
No.

1257
01:14:03.878 --> 01:14:05.513
You are not gonna do this.

1258
01:14:05.546 --> 01:14:07.014
I'm so tired.

1259
01:14:07.048 --> 01:14:09.650
You're not gonna mind fuck me
like this.

1260
01:14:09.684 --> 01:14:10.952
- Why are you pretending like

1261
01:14:10.985 --> 01:14:13.187
you don't know
what I'm talking about?

1262
01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:15.488
All those people out there
in the world

1263
01:14:15.523 --> 01:14:20.161
and the shit that they do.
what is that compared to this?

1264
01:14:20.194 --> 01:14:23.130
I hate myself
when I'm out there.

1265
01:14:23.164 --> 01:14:26.767
I hate the way I look
and the sound of my voice.

1266
01:14:26.801 --> 01:14:28.803
I hate myself out there.

1267
01:14:28.836 --> 01:14:33.708
But in here. when I'm with you.

1268
01:14:33.741 --> 01:14:37.144
I am exactly who I want to be.

1269
01:14:39.714 --> 01:14:42.550
When I'm in control of you. I--

1270
01:14:42.583 --> 01:14:45.553
I am the person that I dreamed
I would be when I was young.

1271
01:14:45.586 --> 01:14:46.954
I am--I'm--

1272
01:14:46.988 --> 01:14:51.993
I'm funny. and I'm mean.
and I am strong.

1273
01:14:52.026 --> 01:14:58.833
And I never. never feel
like that out there.

1274
01:14:58.866 --> 01:15:01.569
And it's the same for you.

1275
01:15:01.602 --> 01:15:02.570
- No.

1276
01:15:02.603 --> 01:15:03.838
It's not.

1277
01:15:03.871 --> 01:15:05.072
I hate that I do this.

1278
01:15:05.106 --> 01:15:07.074
I hate myself. It's shameful.

1279
01:15:08.642 --> 01:15:10.878
- I unlocked something in you.

1280
01:15:12.947 --> 01:15:14.749
- How do you know that?

1281
01:15:14.782 --> 01:15:16.617
- I know.

1282
01:15:16.650 --> 01:15:18.285
I know that you think
that you need to be

1283
01:15:18.319 --> 01:15:21.856
this person like your dad.
who's strong.

1284
01:15:21.889 --> 01:15:23.758
who looks forward
to the future.

1285
01:15:23.791 --> 01:15:25.726
But that's not you.

1286
01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:28.162
You are abnormal.

1287
01:15:28.195 --> 01:15:29.864
And I don't just mean sexually.

1288
01:15:29.897 --> 01:15:31.198
I mean fundamentally in a way

1289
01:15:31.232 --> 01:15:32.733
that most people would just
find unacceptable.

1290
01:15:32.767 --> 01:15:33.901
- Sanctuary.

1291
01:15:33.934 --> 01:15:36.737
- But for me. in here. we fit.

1292
01:15:36.771 --> 01:15:37.905
- Sanctuary.

1293
01:15:37.938 --> 01:15:40.574
- For me. in here.
we fit perfectly.

1294
01:15:40.608 --> 01:15:41.609
- Did you hear me?

1295
01:15:41.642 --> 01:15:42.676
Sanctuary.

1296
01:15:42.710 --> 01:15:44.945
Sanctuary. Sanctuary!

1297
01:15:44.979 --> 01:15:46.113
Sanctuary.
- Sanctuary what?

1298
01:15:46.147 --> 01:15:46.947
- Sanctuary!

1299
01:15:46.981 --> 01:15:48.349
I'm using the safe word.

1300
01:15:48.382 --> 01:15:49.316
Sanctuary!

1301
01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:51.652
Sanctuary! Stop!

1302
01:15:53.788 --> 01:15:56.791
- I'm not playing.

1303
01:15:56.824 --> 01:15:58.192
- Oh. my God.

1304
01:15:58.225 --> 01:16:01.028
Will you just give me
a fucking break?

1305
01:16:01.062 --> 01:16:04.065
Please.
give me a fucking break.

1306
01:16:04.098 --> 01:16:08.035
From the moment you walked back
in here. you want $6 million.

1307
01:16:08.069 --> 01:16:10.671
You want to be co-CEO
of a hotel company.

1308
01:16:10.704 --> 01:16:12.606
You are doing a session.

1309
01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:15.376
- I quit my job.

1310
01:16:15.409 --> 01:16:17.878
I left my fiancé.

1311
01:16:19.346 --> 01:16:20.915
It's true.

1312
01:16:22.316 --> 01:16:23.884
- This isn't real.

1313
01:16:25.386 --> 01:16:27.822
That's not real.

1314
01:16:31.158 --> 01:16:34.929
- This is the only thing
that is real.

1315
01:16:53.714 --> 01:16:55.049
Hal.

1316
01:17:16.937 --> 01:17:17.938
What is this. Hal?

1317
01:17:17.972 --> 01:17:21.175
- You're gonna stop talking.

1318
01:17:21.208 --> 01:17:24.311
If you talk again.
I'm gonna hurt you.

1319
01:17:24.345 --> 01:17:26.313
I will.

1320
01:17:33.888 --> 01:17:37.091
You didn't quit your job.

1321
01:17:37.124 --> 01:17:40.895
You didn't break up
with your boyfriend.

1322
01:17:40.928 --> 01:17:44.732
The only good thing about me
to you is the money.

1323
01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:49.236
That's the truth.

1324
01:17:49.270 --> 01:17:50.738
Now say it.

1325
01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:54.475
- You want me to speak?

1326
01:17:56.944 --> 01:17:59.380
- I want you to say that.

1327
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:07.955
Say it or I will kill you.

1328
01:18:07.988 --> 01:18:09.823
and then I'll kill myself.

1329
01:18:13.127 --> 01:18:15.429
Just tell the truth.

1330
01:18:15.462 --> 01:18:17.464
I am nothing.

1331
01:18:17.498 --> 01:18:21.335
Just say that.

1332
01:18:24.171 --> 01:18:26.340
- I have a better idea.

1333
01:18:29.310 --> 01:18:31.478
We need to play a game.

1334
01:18:31.513 --> 01:18:33.914
It's the last one.
You're gonna--

1335
01:18:33.948 --> 01:18:37.351
- Say what I fucking
told you to say!

1336
01:18:41.889 --> 01:18:43.757
We need to play a game.

1337
01:18:48.429 --> 01:18:50.264
You be you.

1338
01:18:54.802 --> 01:18:57.805
I'll be your dad.

1339
01:19:07.549 --> 01:19:09.183
Greet me.

1340
01:19:12.386 --> 01:19:15.022
I'm your father.

1341
01:19:15.055 --> 01:19:17.224
I said. "Greet me."

1342
01:19:22.896 --> 01:19:24.566
I came back from the fucking
dead to speak to you.

1343
01:19:24.599 --> 01:19:27.101
so the least that you could do
is say hello.

1344
01:19:31.606 --> 01:19:34.174
- Hello.

1345
01:19:39.547 --> 01:19:42.216
- I'm sorry I left you.

1346
01:19:42.249 --> 01:19:45.085
- He wouldn't say that.

1347
01:19:48.088 --> 01:19:50.891
- It was beyond my control.

1348
01:19:57.264 --> 01:19:59.333
Untie Rebecca.

1349
01:20:04.539 --> 01:20:06.307
- No.

1350
01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:09.410
No.

1351
01:20:09.443 --> 01:20:11.178
- Why not?

1352
01:20:17.585 --> 01:20:20.387
- Because you don't have
the power anymore.

1353
01:20:20.421 --> 01:20:22.956
I do.

1354
01:20:22.990 --> 01:20:25.059
And you are gonna take back
what you said

1355
01:20:25.092 --> 01:20:27.895
about your job
and your boyfriend.

1356
01:20:27.928 --> 01:20:31.198
and you are gonna delete
that fucking video.

1357
01:20:34.101 --> 01:20:37.572
- Boy. do not test me!

1358
01:20:45.946 --> 01:20:49.517
Look at this mess you made.
you little shit!

1359
01:20:51.218 --> 01:20:52.920
- This is my fucking place!

1360
01:20:52.953 --> 01:20:54.088
- I'm sorry.

1361
01:20:54.121 --> 01:20:55.122
- Shut up!

1362
01:21:11.205 --> 01:21:12.574
- Where are you?

1363
01:21:17.111 --> 01:21:20.548
Okay. I get it.

1364
01:21:23.317 --> 01:21:25.620
Good job.

1365
01:21:25.653 --> 01:21:27.321
Good game.

1366
01:21:47.441 --> 01:21:52.146
I lived 78 years here on Earth.

1367
01:21:52.179 --> 01:21:55.249
Made money.

1368
01:21:55.282 --> 01:21:57.985
Raised a family.

1369
01:22:02.189 --> 01:22:05.359
I was a lucky man.

1370
01:22:05.392 --> 01:22:08.228
I was happy.

1371
01:22:08.262 --> 01:22:12.499
Thousands of people
worked for me.

1372
01:22:12.534 --> 01:22:15.235
The company I built.

1373
01:22:15.269 --> 01:22:17.705
homes they bought.

1374
01:22:17.739 --> 01:22:19.239
food they ate.

1375
01:22:19.273 --> 01:22:21.241
the clothes they put
on their children's back.

1376
01:22:24.411 --> 01:22:26.180
It was me.

1377
01:22:27.414 --> 01:22:32.219
When I died. they wept.

1378
01:22:32.252 --> 01:22:35.022
I saw them crying.

1379
01:22:36.691 --> 01:22:39.159
I was outside of my body
by then.

1380
01:22:43.464 --> 01:22:46.701
And I could see everything.

1381
01:22:46.734 --> 01:22:50.572
everything that happened.

1382
01:22:50.605 --> 01:22:52.540
everything that's
still to come.

1383
01:23:01.114 --> 01:23:04.451
I saw you crying.

1384
01:23:04.485 --> 01:23:07.722
How scared you were.

1385
01:23:07.755 --> 01:23:12.794
How desperately you wanted
to know that you could do it.

1386
01:23:16.163 --> 01:23:17.732
Be me.

1387
01:23:20.668 --> 01:23:22.604
You can't.

1388
01:23:40.354 --> 01:23:42.155
You are you.

1389
01:23:49.196 --> 01:23:50.632
You hate yourself.

1390
01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:55.803
I understand why you do.

1391
01:23:57.371 --> 01:23:59.607
But that's not gonna change
anything.

1392
01:24:01.676 --> 01:24:05.747
You're nothing like me.
and you never will be.

1393
01:24:11.184 --> 01:24:12.554
Say it.

1394
01:24:16.591 --> 01:24:19.059
- I'm nothing like you.

1395
01:24:22.764 --> 01:24:24.264
- And?

1396
01:24:30.538 --> 01:24:32.507
- And...

1397
01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:34.876
and I don't have to be.

1398
01:26:48.375 --> 01:26:50.011
- Hi.

1399
01:26:50.044 --> 01:26:51.411
- Hey.

1400
01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:57.685
- I deleted the video.

1401
01:26:58.986 --> 01:27:00.420
- Oh.

1402
01:27:00.454 --> 01:27:01.789
Thank you.

1403
01:27:07.695 --> 01:27:08.930
- I should get going.

1404
01:27:08.963 --> 01:27:10.565
- Yeah. I should too.

1405
01:27:17.572 --> 01:27:20.908
Oh. um. do you. uh--

1406
01:27:20.942 --> 01:27:22.476
do you want this?

1407
01:27:25.445 --> 01:27:26.614
- It's not broken?

1408
01:27:26.647 --> 01:27:28.415
- No. It's waterproof.

1409
01:27:38.059 --> 01:27:39.060
- Thanks.

1410
01:27:39.093 --> 01:27:40.460
- Mm-hmm.

1411
01:28:11.659 --> 01:28:13.493
I'm running late.

1412
01:28:16.496 --> 01:28:18.699
I have to--

1413
01:28:18.733 --> 01:28:21.035
my mom. she wants to discuss...

1414
01:28:22.904 --> 01:28:26.007
Uh. she's giving a speech
at this dinner

1415
01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:31.012
to. you know. debut me.
and uh...

1416
01:28:33.681 --> 01:28:36.349
It's--it's funny.

1417
01:28:36.383 --> 01:28:40.054
The thought of. you know. like.
what if I just didn't show up?

1418
01:28:43.157 --> 01:28:44.759
Like. she's just talking
and talking. I don't come out.

1419
01:28:44.792 --> 01:28:47.862
Might be funny.

1420
01:28:50.531 --> 01:28:51.632
After you.

1421
01:29:05.146 --> 01:29:06.047
What if I didn't do it?

1422
01:29:08.950 --> 01:29:10.585
- The job?

1423
01:29:10.618 --> 01:29:12.419
- Yeah.

1424
01:29:12.452 --> 01:29:15.590
- Somebody else would.
and everything your dad built

1425
01:29:15.623 --> 01:29:17.457
would belong to them.

1426
01:29:17.490 --> 01:29:19.727
- Right.

1427
01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:20.795
- If you hate these people
so much.

1428
01:29:20.828 --> 01:29:21.729
why don't you just
get rid of them?

1429
01:29:21.762 --> 01:29:23.798
- It's not that simple.

1430
01:29:23.831 --> 01:29:25.933
- Don't tell me what I do
and do not know. Hal.

1431
01:29:25.967 --> 01:29:27.735
You can absolutely
get rid of them.

1432
01:29:27.768 --> 01:29:29.737
It's called management buyout.

1433
01:29:29.770 --> 01:29:31.572
- Right. Yeah.

1434
01:29:31.606 --> 01:29:33.440
So what--what--

1435
01:29:33.473 --> 01:29:34.909
- Okay. you inherited money
from your father.

1436
01:29:34.942 --> 01:29:36.978
some obscene amount. right?
- Yes.

1437
01:29:37.011 --> 01:29:38.411
- So you take
all of that money.

1438
01:29:38.445 --> 01:29:40.948
The market cap is 185.
Can you cover that?

1439
01:29:40.982 --> 01:29:43.951
- Um. that would be--
that's. like. everything.

1440
01:29:43.985 --> 01:29:46.020
- So you take
all of that money.

1441
01:29:46.053 --> 01:29:47.788
and then you would buy back
the company.

1442
01:29:47.822 --> 01:29:49.123
Then it's yours.
You can do whatever you want.

1443
01:29:49.156 --> 01:29:50.725
You can fire the board.
It doesn't matter.

1444
01:29:50.758 --> 01:29:51.792
- Managed buyout?

1445
01:29:51.826 --> 01:29:54.195
- Management.
- Management.

1446
01:29:54.228 --> 01:29:55.596
Right.

1447
01:30:06.807 --> 01:30:08.209
Is that what you would do?

1448
01:30:09.977 --> 01:30:11.879
- If I were you?

1449
01:30:11.913 --> 01:30:14.081
- Yeah.

1450
01:30:14.115 --> 01:30:16.050
- Yeah. maybe.

1451
01:30:18.786 --> 01:30:21.122
- What if you were me?

1452
01:30:21.155 --> 01:30:22.189
- What does that mean?

1453
01:30:24.025 --> 01:30:26.727
- What if you took the job.
not me?

1454
01:30:28.529 --> 01:30:29.830
- That doesn't--

1455
01:30:29.864 --> 01:30:32.600
- You just said.
if I do the manager buyback--

1456
01:30:32.633 --> 01:30:34.635
whatever--I can do what I want.

1457
01:30:34.669 --> 01:30:35.736
So I do that.

1458
01:30:35.770 --> 01:30:38.773
and I make you CEO.

1459
01:30:38.806 --> 01:30:39.974
- You're scared
about saying goodbye.

1460
01:30:40.007 --> 01:30:41.142
but you don't have to be.
- No. Shut up.

1461
01:30:41.175 --> 01:30:43.476
This could actually work.

1462
01:30:43.511 --> 01:30:44.946
- Just because I know
more about this than you do

1463
01:30:44.979 --> 01:30:45.579
doesn't mean that I would be
any good at this. Hal.

1464
01:30:45.613 --> 01:30:46.914
It doesn't mean anything.

1465
01:30:46.948 --> 01:30:47.882
- I grew up
around these people.

1466
01:30:47.915 --> 01:30:49.583
I was raised by one of them.

1467
01:30:49.617 --> 01:30:50.985
They all dream all day.

1468
01:30:51.018 --> 01:30:52.253
They read books.
they hire coaches.

1469
01:30:52.286 --> 01:30:54.655
all to be exactly like you.

1470
01:30:54.689 --> 01:30:56.557
Fucking crazy and vindictive.

1471
01:30:56.590 --> 01:30:57.825
- I'm only like that at work.

1472
01:30:57.858 --> 01:30:59.260
- Yeah. this would be
your work.

1473
01:30:59.293 --> 01:31:00.895
- Don't tell me what I want.

1474
01:31:00.928 --> 01:31:01.996
This is your problem. not mine.

1475
01:31:02.029 --> 01:31:06.801
- You said that
you love who you are

1476
01:31:06.834 --> 01:31:09.036
when you're playing the game.

1477
01:31:09.070 --> 01:31:13.541
You can be that person
all day. every day.

1478
01:31:17.545 --> 01:31:21.182
- So I would just go in there
and say what I want to do?

1479
01:31:21.215 --> 01:31:23.050
- And you just bend everyone
around to your will.

1480
01:31:23.084 --> 01:31:24.685
and it doesn't matter
if you're right or wrong.

1481
01:31:24.719 --> 01:31:26.821
It just matters that
people listen to what you say.

1482
01:31:28.923 --> 01:31:31.125
- You want to spend
$185 million on this?

1483
01:31:31.158 --> 01:31:32.693
- Yes.

1484
01:31:32.727 --> 01:31:34.929
- All of your money?
- Yes.

1485
01:31:34.962 --> 01:31:36.163
- What are you gonna do?

1486
01:31:36.197 --> 01:31:36.831
- What do you mean?

1487
01:31:36.864 --> 01:31:37.965
- All day while I'm at work.

1488
01:31:37.999 --> 01:31:39.166
what are you gonna do?

1489
01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:39.834
- Nothing.

1490
01:31:39.867 --> 01:31:43.204
I'll be like. uh. your wife.

1491
01:31:43.237 --> 01:31:45.172
- Having no job. having
nothing important to do all day

1492
01:31:45.206 --> 01:31:46.574
but wait for somebody
to come home?

1493
01:31:46.607 --> 01:31:47.675
That destroys people.

1494
01:31:47.708 --> 01:31:49.043
- You're right. I don't know.

1495
01:31:49.076 --> 01:31:50.678
But listen. I know
what it takes to do this job.

1496
01:31:50.711 --> 01:31:52.580
It's hard. okay?

1497
01:31:52.613 --> 01:31:53.748
It takes everything.

1498
01:31:53.781 --> 01:31:55.716
So you're gonna need
comfort. support.

1499
01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:58.886
stability. food. sex. laundry.

1500
01:31:58.919 --> 01:32:01.722
What do you call the person
that does all those things?

1501
01:32:01.756 --> 01:32:03.124
- A slave.

1502
01:32:03.157 --> 01:32:06.227
- That is the job
that I was meant for.

1503
01:32:10.898 --> 01:32:12.666
- What are you gonna tell
your mom?

1504
01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:13.734
See?

1505
01:32:13.768 --> 01:32:15.736
Not gonna work.

1506
01:32:15.770 --> 01:32:17.872
You can't even.
in an imaginary conversation.

1507
01:32:17.905 --> 01:32:18.539
think about
what you'd say to her

1508
01:32:18.572 --> 01:32:19.607
without almost throwing up.

1509
01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:21.575
- Wait.

1510
01:32:21.609 --> 01:32:23.878
- What?

1511
01:32:23.911 --> 01:32:25.179
- I know exactly what I'd say.

1512
01:32:25.212 --> 01:32:26.213
- Liar.

1513
01:32:26.247 --> 01:32:27.248
- I am not lying.

1514
01:32:27.281 --> 01:32:28.049
I'm fighting.

1515
01:32:28.082 --> 01:32:29.750
That's how you get
what you want.

1516
01:32:29.784 --> 01:32:31.585
- Oh. okay. What is it then?
What would you say?

1517
01:32:31.619 --> 01:32:33.354
- I'd say...

1518
01:32:38.993 --> 01:32:43.764
I'd say. "This is Rebecca.

1519
01:32:43.798 --> 01:32:45.633
"We're in love.

1520
01:32:45.666 --> 01:32:47.268
She's in charge now."
