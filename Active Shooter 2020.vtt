3
00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:20.665
(light dramatic music)

4
00:02:23.378 --> 00:02:25.680
(women panting and moaning)

5
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.793
- Can we. can we talk about something?

6
00:02:28.703 --> 00:02:30.003
- No. not right now.

7
00:02:30.877 --> 00:02:31.843
- Renee. listen.

8
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.470
- You don't wanna do this anymore?

9
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.127
- It's not that. I just...

10
00:02:51.753 --> 00:02:52.623
Wait. wait-

11
00:02:52.623 --> 00:02:54.423
- Give me something to work with.

12
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.723
- What? What is it?

13
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.073
- Do you still want this?

14
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.453
- More than ever.

15
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.640
- Then promise me we'll
work something out.

16
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.473
- I don't. I don't know what that means.

17
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.950
- I...
(door opens)

18
00:03:26.271 --> 00:03:28.350
(footsteps approaching)

19
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.190
- [Juliette] I told you we're
not delivering on anything

20
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.803
less than our usual cut.

21
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.790
Come again?

22
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.990
You're breaking up.

23
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.020
No. it can't be on my
end. It must be on yours.

24
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.403
Call me back when you
get a better signal. bye!

25
00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.943
These headsets are such pieces of shit.

26
00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:49.783
Renee?

27
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.523
I know your shoes. Renee.

28
00:03:57.411 --> 00:03:59.111
(toilet flushes)
- Yeah. it's me.

29
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.070
- Do you have a dick?

30
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.903
- A what?

31
00:04:08.813 --> 00:04:09.913
- You have a dick now?

32
00:04:11.064 --> 00:04:12.350
Like you were peeing standing up.

33
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.200
- Wow. you definitely just said that.

34
00:04:15.538 --> 00:04:17.170
- Lighten up.

35
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.393
- I was just tossing the coffee.

36
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.110
- You seem a little out of it.

37
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.560
You barely said a word on
that call this morning.

38
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.760
- Yeah. I'm fine.

39
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.970
Just a lot on my mind.

40
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.390
- Well. we all need to be 100%

41
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.120
over the next couple of months.

42
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.170
- 20% of the company just
got let go this week.

43
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.950
- Then make it 120%.

44
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.960
If you're worried about
the layoffs. you're safe.

45
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.050
- What does that mean?

46
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.250
- That means I got to
weigh in on our department.

47
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.207
- They asked you.

48
00:04:51.905 --> 00:04:55.410
- You seem surprised that I
didn't throw you under the bus.

49
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.460
Can you imagine the
weight on my shoulders?

50
00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.083
- I don't know. How does it feel?

51
00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.200
- Fan-fucking-tastic actually.

52
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.790
I was on the call when
they announced the cuts

53
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.630
and the budget for next quarter.

54
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.803
Stocks rose faster than
their shriveled lil' dicks.

55
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.090
- Charming.

56
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.993
- Guess how high.

57
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.520
Seriously. guess.

58
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.273
- In inches or?

59
00:05:21.184 --> 00:05:23.220
2%.
- 7%

60
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.310
I'm cracking open a bottle of Veuve

61
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.720
at the end of the day in my office.

62
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.573
Swing by if you want.

63
00:05:29.573 --> 00:05:30.923
- I think I'll pass.

64
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.043
- Is that her?
- Is that who?

65
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.970
Figured you were sore
about your girlfriend.

66
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.600
- Girlfriend?

67
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.433
- Catalina.

68
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.820
Don't play dumb. She was my assistant.

69
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.470
It was pretty obvious you
two had something going on.

70
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.350
- What would I be sore about?

71
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.373
- The layoffs.

72
00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.480
She didn't tell you?

73
00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.913
- No. she didn't tell me yet.

74
00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.773
- Well. no hard feelings.

75
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.000
I mean. if I were...

76
00:06:13.056 --> 00:06:14.810
I'd be all over that too.

77
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:15.823
- What the fuck.

78
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:18.530
- You are taking this hard.

79
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.867
- Yeah. I can take that
a little bit personally.

80
00:06:20.867 --> 00:06:21.963
- Fair enough.

81
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.870
It had nothing to do with you.

82
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.000
In fact. the higher ups
are really impressed

83
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.113
with your performance.

84
00:06:29.028 --> 00:06:32.173
It's amazing how little
action worked wonders for you.

85
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.060
Or maybe she was giving you
information about my clients

86
00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.540
'cause you always seemed
to be just one step ahead.

87
00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.290
- Do you think I'm capable of that?

88
00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.600
- Why else were you with her?

89
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.573
Did you really see a future together?

90
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.550
Seems like I did you a favor.

91
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.030
- You know. it's a little pathetic

92
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.400
when you're the only
one playing this game.

93
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.530
- So. it was just a fling?

94
00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.014
- Just a fling.

95
00:06:59.014 --> 00:07:00.490
- Then no harm done.

96
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.410
You'll find another little plaything soon.

97
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:06.003
Hey. maybe my new assistant.
you might like him.

98
00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:08.360
Oh. but you're...

99
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.423
But you can switch teams
whenever it suits you. right?

100
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.460
- You know me.

101
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.780
- Don't sell yourself short.
break it off with her.

102
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.330
Maybe there's hope for you yet.

103
00:07:25.286 --> 00:07:26.713
You're out of paper towels.

104
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:30.700
- Maybe you shouldn't have
cut half the cleaning staff.

105
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.533
- I'll be fine.

106
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.963
Alex. talk to me.

107
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:37.020
You're killing me here.

108
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:09.253
- I'm so sorry. Cat.

109
00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:15.333
- Was I just a fling? Just
your little plaything?

110
00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:17.533
- Juliette said plaything.

111
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:21.370
- I tried to tell you what was going on.

112
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.270
- When's your last day?

113
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:28.593
- Today.

114
00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:31.033
- So let's talk.

115
00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:35.850
- Maybe she was right.

116
00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:37.203
Maybe you were using me.

117
00:08:38.779 --> 00:08:40.513
- You're taking her side now?

118
00:08:41.491 --> 00:08:42.700
- You know what. I tried to
take your fucking side before.

119
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.100
but guess what?

120
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.423
I don't know anymore.

121
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.433
- So you don't trust me?

122
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:51.420
- Why couldn't you answer her question?

123
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.123
Do we have a future together?

124
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:06.763
- I think so.
- Then say it.

125
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:16.043
I think you should go.

126
00:09:51.603 --> 00:09:54.210
(box of tissues clattering)

127
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:55.083
- Nice.

128
00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.197
(gun firing)

129
00:10:17.691 --> 00:10:20.608
(people screaming)

130
00:10:23.379 --> 00:10:24.212
Oh. shit!

131
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.813
(Catalina sniffling)

132
00:10:42.694 --> 00:10:44.143
- [911 Operator] 911.
what is your emergency?

133
00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:46.803
- I think I heard gunshots
on my office building.

134
00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:52.753
- [911 operator] Are
you in a safe location?

135
00:10:52.753 --> 00:10:55.843
- I'm in the ladies
room. I think it's safe.

136
00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:58.750
I don't know. I think-

137
00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:00.063
- [911 Operator] Are you alone?

138
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:02.950
- Can the police come?

139
00:11:03.846 --> 00:11:05.130
- [911 Operator] Units have
already been dispatched.

140
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:08.249
If you feel it's unsafe
to leave your location.

141
00:11:08.249 --> 00:11:11.259
stay put. stay quiet. lock the door

142
00:11:11.259 --> 00:11:12.736
and barricade if you can.

143
00:11:12.736 --> 00:11:14.319
- All right. hurry.

144
00:11:15.436 --> 00:11:17.333
- [911 Operator] Do
you have a description-

145
00:11:17.333 --> 00:11:20.583
(light dramatic music)

146
00:11:26.518 --> 00:11:27.351
- Cat?

147
00:11:29.611 --> 00:11:30.694
Are you okay?

148
00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:36.526
All you have to do is just keep quiet.

149
00:11:42.361 --> 00:11:44.944
(phone buzzes)

150
00:12:01.286 --> 00:12:03.703
(gun firing)

151
00:12:21.748 --> 00:12:23.165
Come on. respond!

152
00:12:37.436 --> 00:12:39.563
(door opening)

153
00:12:39.563 --> 00:12:42.480
(Juliette gasping)

154
00:12:47.274 --> 00:12:48.601
- Renee?

155
00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:50.101
- Juls.
- Oh. shit!

156
00:12:51.014 --> 00:12:52.464
Holy fucking shit!

157
00:12:52.464 --> 00:12:54.091
- What happened?
- I don't know.

158
00:12:54.091 --> 00:12:55.140
What did you see?
- Nothing.

159
00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:56.563
I. I. I heard shots.

160
00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.713
I don't know.

161
00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:00.853
Jesus.

162
00:13:01.901 --> 00:13:04.753
I saw people running so I
just ran as fast as I can.

163
00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:08.367
Oh my God. Oh my God.

164
00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:12.532
Get this off of me.

165
00:13:13.794 --> 00:13:16.075
(Juliette panting)

166
00:13:16.075 --> 00:13:16.908
Oh God.

167
00:13:21.038 --> 00:13:22.871
I did this.
- Did what?

168
00:13:24.104 --> 00:13:28.771
The cuts. I have pushed some
poor bastard over the edge.

169
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:31.473
This is on me.

170
00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:41.693
- We can hide until this blows over.

171
00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.220
Police are on their way.

172
00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:46.360
Come on.
- God.

173
00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.453
Alex. Alex. are you still at your desk?

174
00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:53.353
Alex?

175
00:13:55.235 --> 00:13:56.402
Piece of shit.

176
00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:58.430
- I'm sure he's fine.

177
00:14:07.197 --> 00:14:08.030
- I'm sorry.

178
00:14:10.847 --> 00:14:12.323
- None of that matters now.

179
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:16.963
- I know I've been difficult.

180
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.419
- Everything's under control now.

181
00:14:20.419 --> 00:14:22.836
(gun firing)

182
00:14:24.415 --> 00:14:25.805
- Maybe we should make a run for it.

183
00:14:25.805 --> 00:14:26.776
- No.

184
00:14:26.776 --> 00:14:27.609
- We should make a run for it and-

185
00:14:27.609 --> 00:14:28.483
- No. we're safe in here.

186
00:14:30.093 --> 00:14:35.093
(woman screams)
(gun fires)

187
00:14:36.911 --> 00:14:39.828
- [Woman] He's coming. he's coming.

188
00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:45.639
- What if they're hurt?

189
00:14:45.639 --> 00:14:46.640
- What if the shooter
is right behind them?

190
00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.363
No. just leave them.
maybe they'll go away.

191
00:14:52.839 --> 00:14:55.256
(gun firing)

192
00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:02.067
What are you doing?
Are you posting online?

193
00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.060
- I'm texting someone.

194
00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:08.623
- [Dale] Is anyone in there?

195
00:15:10.329 --> 00:15:11.280
- We should help him.

196
00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.490
- Maybe he's the shooter.

197
00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.393
- [Dale] I can hear you.

198
00:15:15.393 --> 00:15:17.053
Please. please open up.

199
00:15:24.696 --> 00:15:26.446
- What are you doing?

200
00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.573
- [Dale] Please.

201
00:15:34.166 --> 00:15:35.708
- Renee. don't.

202
00:15:35.708 --> 00:15:38.399
- [Dale] I can hear you in there. Oh. God!

203
00:15:38.399 --> 00:15:39.732
Please.
- Don't.

204
00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.893
Oh. God. (panting)

205
00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:48.983
- Are you hurt?

206
00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:52.143
Keep it down.

207
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:54.550
Are you hurt?

208
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:57.156
- [Dale] I don't know. there's blood.

209
00:15:57.156 --> 00:15:57.989
There's blood-

210
00:15:57.989 --> 00:15:59.642
- What's wrong with the men's room?

211
00:15:59.642 --> 00:16:02.450
- [Dale] I just came from
there. it's fucking bad.

212
00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:03.550
- Hide someplace else.

213
00:16:05.226 --> 00:16:07.559
- [Dale] I'm scared. please.

214
00:16:08.429 --> 00:16:09.429
- So are we.

215
00:16:10.772 --> 00:16:12.894
(door rattling)

216
00:16:12.894 --> 00:16:15.662
- Did you hear something?

217
00:16:15.662 --> 00:16:17.640
(Dale banging door)

218
00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:21.307
- He's making too much noise.
- Renee. don't!

219
00:16:24.056 --> 00:16:27.139
- Oh God. (gasping).

220
00:16:40.211 --> 00:16:41.044
Thank you.

221
00:16:46.679 --> 00:16:48.429
Thank you. thank you.

222
00:17:04.891 --> 00:17:07.724
(water splashing)

223
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:14.953
So fucking bad out there.

224
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:18.140
- How did you get past the shooter?

225
00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.060
- I don't know.

226
00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:22.127
- Did you see him?

227
00:17:29.348 --> 00:17:30.181
- No.

228
00:17:37.813 --> 00:17:40.213
- I don't recognize you.
what department you in?

229
00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:45.060
- I know him. He's in security

230
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:49.313
- Yeah. I was.

231
00:17:52.028 --> 00:17:54.253
I came to pick up my last check.

232
00:17:55.401 --> 00:17:57.565
- Are you part of the layoffs?

233
00:17:57.565 --> 00:18:01.343
- Yeah.
(paper towel ripping)

234
00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:08.390
- Did you get your check?

235
00:18:11.088 --> 00:18:12.538
- No. I didn't make it there.

236
00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:15.913
- How about an ID badge?

237
00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.043
- His name is Dale. He's not lying.

238
00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.363
- I must've lost it.

239
00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.640
- Why are you on the eighth floor?

240
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:32.543
- Juls.

241
00:18:34.049 --> 00:18:35.723
- I don't know where accounting is. lady.

242
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:38.430
- Accounting is on the second floor.

243
00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:42.100
- That's good to know.

244
00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.513
- How long have you worked here?

245
00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:50.773
- Three years.

246
00:19:05.419 --> 00:19:08.560
I'll just stay over here. okay?

247
00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.393
- Yeah.

248
00:19:11.231 --> 00:19:14.481
(drier whirring)
Fuck.

249
00:19:16.062 --> 00:19:19.312
(light dramatic music)

250
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:42.180
- We can get through this. Cat.

251
00:20:02.362 --> 00:20:04.494
- What the fuck are we doing?

252
00:20:04.494 --> 00:20:05.557
What are you doing?
- Quiet.

253
00:20:05.557 --> 00:20:07.087
You were texting someone.
- Yeah.

254
00:20:07.087 --> 00:20:09.750
Someone in the building?
- Yeah.

255
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:11.100
Maybe they saw the shooter.

256
00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.340
- I don't know. she's not responding.

257
00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.403
- Fuck. Sorry.

258
00:20:19.173 --> 00:20:20.930
- Maybe she lost it.

259
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:21.763
Yeah. maybe.

260
00:20:21.763 --> 00:20:24.840
Look. our guy's story isn't adding up.

261
00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.550
- We've no idea what he's been through.

262
00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:28.553
- No. something doesn't feel right.

263
00:20:28.553 --> 00:20:31.350
I think I saw him before
the shooting started.

264
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:32.680
- He said he didn't say anything.

265
00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.000
- Things are starting
to come back to me now.

266
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.590
- You saw him?

267
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:38.000
- I don't know (indistinct).

268
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.150
We haven't heard a
gunshot since he got in.

269
00:21:01.018 --> 00:21:03.070
- You're overreacting.

270
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:04.017
- You know I'm right.

271
00:21:04.017 --> 00:21:07.240
- You're not wrong but it's
not exactly a smoking gun.

272
00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.323
- It's the only thing that makes sense.

273
00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.180
Why did you have to let him in here?

274
00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:13.910
- He said he was hit.

275
00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:15.033
- He lied about that.

276
00:21:16.176 --> 00:21:18.220
- I'm not gonna send him
back out there to die.

277
00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:19.090
- Then I will.

278
00:21:28.124 --> 00:21:30.207
Where the fuck did he go?

279
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:45.100
- Respecting your space.

280
00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:48.990
This is also a better
place to listen from. so...

281
00:21:51.387 --> 00:21:52.800
- Probably for the best.

282
00:21:53.809 --> 00:21:55.430
- Hey. did you guys check
for like a vent or something

283
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:56.480
we can escape out of?

284
00:21:57.570 --> 00:21:59.247
- This isn't fucking "Die Hard".

285
00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:01.930
- Thank you. That's helpful.

286
00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.730
- I think we're just
a little on edge here.

287
00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:06.563
- Agreed.

288
00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:22.730
- Can I use one of the stalls. please?

289
00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:24.753
- No.

290
00:22:25.883 --> 00:22:28.520
- Come on. I'll be quick.

291
00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:29.353
- No.

292
00:22:31.636 --> 00:22:33.123
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.

293
00:22:38.039 --> 00:22:39.862
- What the fuck are you doing?

294
00:22:39.862 --> 00:22:40.695
- Gonna piss right here.

295
00:22:40.695 --> 00:22:43.149
- What. go ahead. here. just go.

296
00:22:43.149 --> 00:22:44.149
- Thank you.

297
00:22:45.649 --> 00:22:46.680
Would you like to sit in the chair

298
00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.990
and lock the door with your body?

299
00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:49.823
- Just go.

300
00:22:54.759 --> 00:22:56.950
Was that a gun?
- That was a gun.

301
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:58.410
Told you we should haven't let him in.

302
00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:00.020
- He needed help. he's security.

303
00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:02.341
- He was security.

304
00:23:02.341 --> 00:23:03.230
- [Dale] Can you guys please talk?

305
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:05.610
I can't do this with you listening.

306
00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:07.670
- What. now you've got stage fright?

307
00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:09.413
- [Dale] Wasn't really gonna whip it out.

308
00:23:13.001 --> 00:23:14.834
- Knew it.
- We talked.

309
00:23:16.126 --> 00:23:19.086
Right. and then he fucking shoots us

310
00:23:19.086 --> 00:23:21.086
and then we fucking die.

311
00:23:25.757 --> 00:23:28.424
(pee trickling)

312
00:23:33.923 --> 00:23:36.113
- [Dale] I didn't flush
for obvious reasons.

313
00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.430
- I think we don't feel comfortable

314
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:43.203
with you in here with us anymore.

315
00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:50.283
- Really?

316
00:23:51.962 --> 00:23:53.470
I'm not a fucking pervert.

317
00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:55.823
I just. I just came to hide.

318
00:23:56.975 --> 00:23:57.808
That's it.

319
00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:00.463
- Just leave.

320
00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.160
- You just want me to fucking die.

321
00:24:08.033 --> 00:24:10.940
(scoffs) I'll leave
when the cops get here.

322
00:24:20.833 --> 00:24:22.798
- Fuck this.

323
00:24:22.798 --> 00:24:24.070
- What the fuck are you doing?

324
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:25.759
(gun clatters)

325
00:24:25.759 --> 00:24:28.180
(blow lands)

326
00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:29.013
- Gun!

327
00:24:31.021 --> 00:24:33.438
(blow lands)

328
00:24:36.595 --> 00:24:39.012
(blow lands)

329
00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:53.697
- Who the fuck are you?

330
00:24:55.081 --> 00:24:57.133
You guys knew she was in
there the whole fucking time?

331
00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:01.103
- Don't move!

332
00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.320
- Juliette. I said don't fucking move.

333
00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:09.010
- Catalina. you watch where
you're pointing that gun.

334
00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:10.250
- Stop talking.

335
00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:11.453
- Lower the gun. Cat.

336
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:14.850
- Let me. let me think.

337
00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:16.090
- We can talk about this.

338
00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:16.923
- Let me think!

339
00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.587
- Seriously. who the fuck is that...

340
00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:24.110
I'm not the shooter. okay?

341
00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:25.440
I haven't hurt anyone.

342
00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.053
- Because we have your gun.
- I have his gun.

343
00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:31.200
- You fucking idiots. the real shooter

344
00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.140
is right fucking out there.

345
00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:32.973
you think you caught him?

346
00:25:32.973 --> 00:25:34.653
Oh my. we're gonna fuckin' die.

347
00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:44.330
- We can tie him up
until the police arrive.

348
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:45.930
- [Dale] What a great idea.

349
00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:46.763
- Do it.

350
00:25:47.998 --> 00:25:50.811
- With what? Fucking Kleenex?

351
00:25:50.811 --> 00:25:52.343
- Trash bags. use a trash bag.

352
00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:55.450
- There aren't any.

353
00:25:59.049 --> 00:26:01.560
- I saw a janitor's cart
right outside the door.

354
00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.460
- That could work.

355
00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:04.773
- Then go.

356
00:26:07.108 --> 00:26:09.607
- Me?
- Yeah. you.

357
00:26:09.607 --> 00:26:10.483
- Are you scared?

358
00:26:11.608 --> 00:26:13.060
- Of what?

359
00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.300
- The real shooter

360
00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:15.600
- I'm very open to the possibility

361
00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.330
that there could be two shooters.

362
00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:18.163
- I'll go.

363
00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:20.283
- Wait.

364
00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:26.853
Okay.

365
00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:35.410
- If you hear any gunshots...

366
00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:40.883
- We'll call the cops.

367
00:26:48.058 --> 00:26:50.808
(chair scraping)

368
00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.893
- The cart was right outside.

369
00:27:13.367 --> 00:27:15.360
- What's taking so fucking long.

370
00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.860
- Maybe you should go get her.

371
00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:18.853
- Renee!

372
00:27:25.324 --> 00:27:26.157
- Renee!

373
00:27:28.135 --> 00:27:28.968
- Renee!

374
00:27:51.456 --> 00:27:53.706
What did you see out there?

375
00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:59.943
- I couldn't find the trash bags.

376
00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:04.427
And this chair isn't keeping anyone out.

377
00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:14.773
- Do it.

378
00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:19.243
In the stall.

379
00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:23.303
Get up.

380
00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:27.710
Get up. I will fucking
shoot you in the head.

381
00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:28.723
- Okay. okay.

382
00:28:46.814 --> 00:28:48.660
Get down on the toilet.

383
00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.333
Get down on the toilet!

384
00:28:51.487 --> 00:28:52.320
(blow lands)

385
00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.760
- Do what she says.

386
00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.483
- Oh. fuck.

387
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:58.263
- Tie his hands.

388
00:29:02.223 --> 00:29:07.110
(Dale groaning)
- Oh. fuck.

389
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:09.313
- Hurry up.
- All right.

390
00:29:11.063 --> 00:29:12.210
- What is your plan?

391
00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:14.880
- Tie his feet.
- Okay. all right.

392
00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:18.253
- We should be formulating a plan.

393
00:29:19.232 --> 00:29:21.580
we should be in constant
contact with the police.

394
00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:23.650
You should not be tying
up the only motherfucker

395
00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:25.200
that knows how to use that gun.

396
00:29:29.313 --> 00:29:30.383
- Why'd you bring it?

397
00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.730
- I always carry it.

398
00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:34.300
- Fuck off with that.

399
00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.963
Who brings a loaded gun
to a former workplace?

400
00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:41.150
- I have a concealed carry permit

401
00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:43.923
in my fucking pocket right fucking here.

402
00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:54.380
- I thought the whole point of this

403
00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:55.833
was to be able to shoot back.

404
00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:00.310
- Everybody's a hero at a gun range.

405
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:05.133
He has an AK. that is a
Beretta. I was outgunned.

406
00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.890
I'm not stepping in to that shit.

407
00:30:16.924 --> 00:30:19.825
- Well. it's about fucking time.

408
00:30:19.825 --> 00:30:23.575
(helicopter blades whirring)

409
00:30:28.968 --> 00:30:29.807
How long do you think it'll take for 'em

410
00:30:29.807 --> 00:30:31.808
to get in the building?

411
00:30:31.808 --> 00:30:33.400
- [Dale] Depends. if the
shooter is (indistinct)

412
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.233
on this floor.

413
00:30:40.867 --> 00:30:43.450
(phone buzzes)

414
00:30:44.736 --> 00:30:45.873
- She's okay.

415
00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:58.363
- Did she see the shooter?
Is it an employee?

416
00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.330
- She didn't see his face.

417
00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:03.480
- Show me what it says.

418
00:31:05.638 --> 00:31:06.471
- Cat!

419
00:31:37.283 --> 00:31:38.443
- Is that bleach?

420
00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:40.323
Fuck!

421
00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:43.540
- You you really know a
lot about guns. don't you?

422
00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:45.080
- What the fuck?

423
00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:47.140
- How'd you know that was an AK?

424
00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.150
- It's a common rifle.
you can tell by the burst.

425
00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:50.810
the fucking sound.

426
00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:52.330
- I know you're part of this.

427
00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:54.230
- I don't want to kill anybody. okay?

428
00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:55.393
I'm not a murderer.

429
00:31:58.064 --> 00:31:59.114
- Fuck you. Fuck you!

430
00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:06.880
Oh God. just let me go. okay?

431
00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:09.650
I will lead the police up here.

432
00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:12.660
They're surrounding the
building as we speak.

433
00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:14.550
- Right. you want me to believe

434
00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:16.627
that you're just gonna stroll out of here

435
00:32:16.627 --> 00:32:20.543
and get help for us with an
active shooter on the loose.

436
00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:25.160
- Please. I know he's out there. okay?

437
00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.110
Let me help fix this.

438
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:29.860
- We haven't heard any shots
since you've been in here.

439
00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:34.650
- Yeah. because he took hostages probably.

440
00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:38.233
- Or he's being held hostage.

441
00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:42.093
- Fuck you!

442
00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:00.610
- Put the gun down. Cat.

443
00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:02.360
- It has your attention doesn't it?

444
00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:07.960
So we're not gonna talk about
those text messages now?

445
00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:12.383
- Do you have any idea
what's going on out there?

446
00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:17.750
This is not a good time
to be talking about us.

447
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:20.103
- When is a better time?

448
00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:25.230
- Let's just get through this.

449
00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:27.530
- We could fucking die here.

450
00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:29.020
- Yeah. we're gonna die if you keep waving

451
00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:30.320
that thing around in here.

452
00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.930
- If you put your phone down.

453
00:33:50.683 --> 00:33:53.266
(phone buzzes)

454
00:33:57.701 --> 00:33:59.293
Are you gonna get that?

455
00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:07.727
- This is more important right now.

456
00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:33.010
- If he comes in here.

457
00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:35.610
you really think she's
capable of handling that gun.

458
00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:38.563
- Then who?

459
00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:41.573
- If not me. fucking you.

460
00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.410
She's gonna misfire that
thing. kill one of us.

461
00:34:45.410 --> 00:34:47.103
and draw some unwanted attention.

462
00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:50.023
She doesn't know what
the fuck she's doing.

463
00:34:51.178 --> 00:34:53.100
- You're not wrong there.

464
00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:54.870
- Why don't you do something about it?

465
00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:56.551
- You're as dumb as you look.

466
00:34:56.551 --> 00:34:58.123
You think you can turn
us against each other?

467
00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:02.093
I think you're afraid that I
might know too much about you.

468
00:35:04.253 --> 00:35:07.290
- I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about. lady.

469
00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:10.140
- I know you're not supposed
to be in the building today.

470
00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.803
The paychecks were mailed out.

471
00:35:14.714 --> 00:35:16.480
I signed them.

472
00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:27.100
- You're behind the layoffs?

473
00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:30.650
- Now do you wanna kill me?

474
00:35:38.466 --> 00:35:40.442
(spits)

475
00:35:40.442 --> 00:35:41.692
Son of a bitch!

476
00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.021
- Don't even think about it.

477
00:36:00.021 --> 00:36:05.021
- Okay. You're. you're still
mad. that's. that's fair.

478
00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:08.393
Did you two work things out?

479
00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.470
- We're all on the same side.

480
00:36:15.844 --> 00:36:18.261
- Look. I get it. we're safe.

481
00:36:20.294 --> 00:36:22.200
We have got our guy.

482
00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:25.090
- [Dale] I'm not the fucking shooter.

483
00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:25.980
- Keep it down.

484
00:36:28.417 --> 00:36:29.250
Okay?

485
00:36:31.835 --> 00:36:34.418
(phone buzzes)

486
00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:49.620
Okay. let's. uh. let's call 911 again.

487
00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:50.530
- I already did.

488
00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:52.270
- Call them again. tell them where we are

489
00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:53.870
and that we have the shooter.

490
00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:55.720
- [Dale] I'm not the fucking shooter.

491
00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:03.143
- Shut up.

492
00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:08.990
Tell them we have one of the shooters.

493
00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:09.823
Is that better?

494
00:37:10.747 --> 00:37:12.843
- (indistinct) and
torturing an innocent man?

495
00:37:18.062 --> 00:37:19.603
- You wanna go another round?

496
00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:25.170
- I didn't fire that
weapon. Check the magazine.

497
00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:26.690
- [Juliette] The what?

498
00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:27.630
- The magazine.

499
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:29.690
- The magazine in the gun.

500
00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:32.140
It can tell us whether
he's fired the gun or not.

501
00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.700
- Do you know what she's talking about?

502
00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:37.160
- I'm trying to help you.

503
00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:39.747
- Yes. of course. I know
what she's talking about.

504
00:37:39.747 --> 00:37:41.423
Tell her.
- I heard.

505
00:37:42.905 --> 00:37:45.910
What's the magazine?
- Oh. for God's sake.

506
00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:48.190
- You hit the release on the handle.

507
00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:49.740
Right there by your thumb. yes.

508
00:37:51.317 --> 00:37:52.170
For the love of Christ.

509
00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:54.220
take your finger off the goddamn trigger.

510
00:37:59.488 --> 00:38:01.883
(magazine clatters)

511
00:38:01.883 --> 00:38:03.550
We're all gonna die.

512
00:38:08.873 --> 00:38:11.523
Here comes the hard part.
you're gonna have to count.

513
00:38:14.804 --> 00:38:16.440
- How many are there?

514
00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.540
- How many are there supposed to be?

515
00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:20.710
- Some have 10 I think.
- 15

516
00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.070
- What are you gonna
do? I have the bullets.

517
00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:25.970
- Give them to me.
- Fuck you. no way.

518
00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:27.610
No. fuck you.
- Okay. Okay.

519
00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:29.960
- Careful. okay? There's
still one in the chamber.

520
00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:32.130
- She has the bullets.

521
00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:34.830
- It automatically feeds
bullets into the chamber

522
00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:35.680
when it's loaded.

523
00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:40.260
- He's saying it's loaded.
- Is it?

524
00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:41.440
- Oh my God. you don't know

525
00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.267
the first fucking thing about guns.

526
00:38:43.267 --> 00:38:44.403
- No. I don't.

527
00:38:45.897 --> 00:38:47.380
- None of your boyfriend's
ever taught you this?

528
00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:51.099
You never took a gun safety
class or went to a range?

529
00:38:51.099 --> 00:38:53.150
(Juliette scoffs)

530
00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:55.540
Whoa. whoa. whoa. hold
on. hold on. hold on.

531
00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:57.840
Check the chamber. you'll
find the last round.

532
00:38:59.499 --> 00:39:01.325
- I don't see anything.

533
00:39:01.325 --> 00:39:03.150
- Pull the slide back.

534
00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:05.650
- I think I have a better way

535
00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:08.643
of finding out if you're lying.

536
00:39:13.321 --> 00:39:15.571
- You're a fucking lunatic.

537
00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:19.672
- Juls.
- Stop it!

538
00:39:19.672 --> 00:39:21.872
- You are not running
things now. Cat! I am.

539
00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:24.650
He's a part of this.

540
00:39:25.701 --> 00:39:28.050
- No. no. think about it. okay?

541
00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:30.678
The shots you heard. fully automatic.

542
00:39:30.678 --> 00:39:32.350
(mimics automatic firing)

543
00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:33.900
That's a semi automatic pistol.

544
00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:36.227
- Listen to him. Juls.

545
00:39:38.011 --> 00:39:39.011
- Tell them.

546
00:39:40.445 --> 00:39:43.923
Tell them you're part of
this. that you're involved.

547
00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:48.970
- I'm just here to pick up my check.

548
00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:50.493
- Fuck off with that.

549
00:39:53.059 --> 00:39:57.399
You've worked in security for three years

550
00:39:57.399 --> 00:39:59.943
and you don't know where accounting is?

551
00:40:04.004 --> 00:40:06.503
- You're not gonna force
a confession out of me.

552
00:40:10.233 --> 00:40:15.233
- Oh. really?

553
00:40:24.987 --> 00:40:27.570
(phone buzzes)

554
00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.813
- Stop. stop. stop. it's not him.

555
00:40:33.818 --> 00:40:37.866
(gun fires)
(Cat screams)

556
00:40:37.866 --> 00:40:40.533
(Dale groaning)

557
00:40:43.892 --> 00:40:44.892
- Oh my God.

558
00:40:47.068 --> 00:40:49.235
(panting)

559
00:40:51.021 --> 00:40:51.854
Oh God.

560
00:40:52.899 --> 00:40:55.030
- What did you do?

561
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:56.770
- I didn't mean to shoot.

562
00:40:56.770 --> 00:40:57.820
I wasn't gonna shoot.

563
00:41:01.202 --> 00:41:04.573
- (indistinct) fuck. fuck!

564
00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:12.400
- I was just defending myself.

565
00:41:14.929 --> 00:41:19.929
- (crying) Help me. help me!

566
00:41:22.727 --> 00:41:23.858
Help!

567
00:41:23.858 --> 00:41:26.191
(gun fires)

568
00:41:33.507 --> 00:41:35.762
You gotta get me outta here.

569
00:41:35.762 --> 00:41:38.027
- We can't do that right now.

570
00:41:38.027 --> 00:41:41.494
- I keep bleeding out
like this. I'm gonna die.

571
00:41:41.494 --> 00:41:45.452
- Can you hold on a little bit longer?

572
00:41:45.452 --> 00:41:47.615
- Where are those fucking cops?

573
00:41:47.615 --> 00:41:48.670
- It sounds like they're
trying to talk to the shooter

574
00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:50.198
from the outside.

575
00:41:50.198 --> 00:41:52.710
- Fucking call. call the
SWAT. I don't fucking care.

576
00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:54.880
I don't wanna die in
this fucking bathroom.

577
00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:57.145
- Even if we call them. they're
not gonna pick up the pace

578
00:41:57.145 --> 00:41:58.880
for one wounded.

579
00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:01.423
What?

580
00:42:03.133 --> 00:42:07.700
- At least we know where they fucking are.

581
00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:10.780
- Look. we just. we just need

582
00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:12.390
to get our story straight here.

583
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:13.640
We're not going anywhere.

584
00:42:14.602 --> 00:42:19.202
- You shot him. unarmed. tied up.

585
00:42:19.202 --> 00:42:21.870
You did that.
- He got free.

586
00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:24.400
You know if I were you.
I would be more worried

587
00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.048
about helping him from bleeding out

588
00:42:26.048 --> 00:42:28.693
than what your story is gonna be.

589
00:42:31.474 --> 00:42:34.969
- You're gonna wait out the clock on me.

590
00:42:34.969 --> 00:42:38.940
Please. please. don't do this.

591
00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:40.530
Please. I'll tell them the shooter.

592
00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:43.710
I'll tell them the shooter guy. please.

593
00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:45.043
Fuck.

594
00:42:45.043 --> 00:42:46.753
- There's not much more
we can do right now.

595
00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:51.573
- Just shut up.

596
00:42:53.383 --> 00:42:54.973
- Help me get to the fucking toilet.

597
00:42:57.206 --> 00:43:01.183
- It wouldn't kill you to
have a little dignity. Juls.

598
00:43:01.183 --> 00:43:03.766
(Dale panting)

599
00:43:05.447 --> 00:43:06.280
- Okay.

600
00:43:27.804 --> 00:43:30.471
(Dale groaning)

601
00:43:31.448 --> 00:43:34.031
(Dale panting)

602
00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:28.133
- Okay. okay!

603
00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:31.340
He came in. he came in like this.

604
00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:35.920
and you were here and then
Catalina was there. right?

605
00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:37.620
- I'm not gonna lie for you. Juls.

606
00:44:38.466 --> 00:44:39.840
- We have to start taking
care of each other.

607
00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:40.743
If not now. when?

608
00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:44.020
- This isn't office politics.

609
00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:46.180
This is a man's life we're talking about.

610
00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:47.230
- It's our lives too.

611
00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:51.563
- There's still a shooter out there.

612
00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:57.073
- Hey.

613
00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:00.100
- Do you want me to leave you alone?

614
00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:04.533
- No.

615
00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:11.990
I need you to get that
gun. and those bullets.

616
00:45:17.426 --> 00:45:19.259
I need you to kill me.

617
00:45:21.867 --> 00:45:23.473
- You know I can't.

618
00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:27.180
- Fuck. it hurt so bad.

619
00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:29.153
- Just hold on a little longer. okay?

620
00:45:33.454 --> 00:45:36.037
(Dale panting)

621
00:45:38.789 --> 00:45:40.330
- If you don't do it. I'm gonna bleed out

622
00:45:40.330 --> 00:45:41.923
like a fucking animal.

623
00:45:47.116 --> 00:45:47.949
- I can't.

624
00:45:57.381 --> 00:46:01.130
- I was supposed to be a part of this.

625
00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:01.963
Today.

626
00:46:11.434 --> 00:46:13.934
I couldn't go through with it.

627
00:46:17.196 --> 00:46:18.663
I wasn't here to pick up a check.

628
00:46:23.070 --> 00:46:25.143
- What the fuck did you just say?

629
00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:30.183
- Fucking kill me. please.

630
00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:34.593
- Why are you doing this?

631
00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:39.520
- It wasn't supposed to go this far.

632
00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:46.433
- Who is out there?

633
00:46:51.135 --> 00:46:52.848
- They heard that shot.

634
00:46:52.848 --> 00:46:53.681
he's gonna be coming to find me.

635
00:46:58.146 --> 00:46:58.979
- Cat?

636
00:47:00.706 --> 00:47:03.360
(gun clicks)

637
00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:06.253
(Dale suffocating)

638
00:47:06.253 --> 00:47:08.670
- We were still talking here.

639
00:47:16.399 --> 00:47:18.524
- We are still talking.

640
00:47:18.524 --> 00:47:20.357
- We're still talking.

641
00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:23.313
Shut the fuck up.

642
00:47:25.979 --> 00:47:27.800
What the fuck are you doing?

643
00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:29.910
- Give me the gun.
- Why?

644
00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:31.710
I'm gonna fucking kill him.

645
00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:32.640
- Stop!

646
00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:35.247
- He's with the shooter!

647
00:47:35.247 --> 00:47:37.002
(Dale grunting)

648
00:47:37.002 --> 00:47:38.597
- Then just let him die.
- Help me.

649
00:47:39.875 --> 00:47:42.792
(Juliette shrieks)

650
00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:47.057
(Dale suffocating)

651
00:47:51.408 --> 00:47:53.825
(neck snaps)

652
00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:03.570
(body plops on the floor)

653
00:48:11.482 --> 00:48:14.399
(Catalina sobbing)

654
00:49:03.364 --> 00:49:06.614
(light dramatic music)

655
00:51:55.970 --> 00:51:57.783
- Okay. okay.

656
00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:04.383
Came in.

657
00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:07.950
He came in violently.

658
00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:09.393
He burst in here.

659
00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:13.373
And he scared us. we were scared already.

660
00:52:15.930 --> 00:52:17.910
And he was creepy looking.

661
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:19.713
No. no.

662
00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:24.190
We let him in. Renee. you knew him.

663
00:52:25.657 --> 00:52:28.060
We let him in. Renee knew him.

664
00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:29.200
we thought we could trust him.

665
00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:30.743
He worked in security.

666
00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:35.810
And then it got violent.

667
00:52:36.872 --> 00:52:38.222
When we saw he had a gun...

668
00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:43.263
And. we just.

669
00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:47.099
we had to defend ourselves.

670
00:52:47.099 --> 00:52:49.710
We were defending ourselves.

671
00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:51.573
- We don't need a fucking alibi.

672
00:52:52.934 --> 00:52:57.934
He was with the shooter. we
didn't do anything wrong (sobs).

673
00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:34.010
We need to figure out a plan
if the other shooter comes in.

674
00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:37.323
- We shoot him.

675
00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:43.553
We'll shoot him.

676
00:53:48.752 --> 00:53:51.419
(Renee sobbing)

677
00:54:32.681 --> 00:54:35.764
- I think they cut the power.
- Yeah.

678
00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:39.067
That means they should be here soon.

679
00:54:47.915 --> 00:54:50.665
(glass breaking)

680
00:54:59.044 --> 00:55:01.794
(drier whirring)

681
00:55:16.688 --> 00:55:19.105
(gun firing)

682
00:55:31.596 --> 00:55:34.179
(door banging)

683
00:56:37.154 --> 00:56:39.987
(shooter wailing)

684
00:57:38.718 --> 00:57:41.135
(gun clicks)

685
00:57:49.193 --> 00:57:50.618
- No.

686
00:57:50.618 --> 00:57:53.035
(gun clicks)

687
00:58:15.609 --> 00:58:17.950
- No! (screams)

688
00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:19.816
(gun firing)

689
00:58:19.816 --> 00:58:22.899
(bullets clattering)

690
00:58:24.361 --> 00:58:27.611
(high pitched buzzing)

691
00:59:12.335 --> 00:59:15.168
(shooter wailing)

692
01:02:34.674 --> 01:02:38.446
(gun fires)
(body falls)

693
01:02:38.446 --> 01:02:41.613
(gun fires severally)

694
01:03:49.977 --> 01:03:52.810
(water splashing)

695
01:03:58.415 --> 01:04:01.082
(Renee panting)

696
01:06:56.311 --> 01:06:59.394
(instrumental music)
