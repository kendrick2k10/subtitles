00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.916
[narrator] The Amazon Jungle.

4
00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:35.541
the largest tropical
rainforest in the world.

5
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.625
is burning.

6
00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:42.916
The forest contains ten percent of the planet's biodiversity

7
00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:45.625
and plays a crucial role
in global climate stability.

8
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:50.833
Over 20% of the forest
has already been lost

9
00:00:50.875 --> 00:00:53.333
and projections show
that at this rate.

10
00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:56.500
there won't be much left
by the turn of the century.

11
00:00:56.541 --> 00:00:59.750
In 2019. the Amazon experienced

12
00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:02.750
a devastating
and unprecedented fire season.

13
00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:05.708
with over 40.000 reported fires

14
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.625
and 3500 square miles
of forest lost.

15
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:13.333
It's estimated that an area
the size of a soccer field
and a half

16
00:01:13.375 --> 00:01:15.958
is lost every minute.

17
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.750
Our team. led by award-winning
filmmaker Michal Siewierski.

18
00:01:19.791 --> 00:01:23.083
decided to embark on
an investigative journey

19
00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:25.125
to uncover
the real reasons behind

20
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:27.833
the catastrophic destruction
of the Amazon forest.

21
00:01:33.875 --> 00:01:37.125
[light tense music]

22
00:01:40.791 --> 00:01:42.916
[Glenn] We're already
seeing consequences

23
00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.041
of deforestation
and climate change.

24
00:01:45.083 --> 00:01:48.500
In South America.
there are almost double the rate

25
00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:50.333
of fires that
there were historically.

26
00:01:50.375 --> 00:01:51.958
[Dr. Neal] You know.
everybody's aware

27
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.041
that there is
environmental damage happening.

28
00:01:54.083 --> 00:01:57.250
People know that the.
the Amazon is being lost.

29
00:01:57.291 --> 00:02:00.875
but I don't think that
most people really connect it
to what's on their fork

30
00:02:00.916 --> 00:02:03.708
[chuckles] at that particular
moment. and that's
what's got to happen.

31
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.125
People have to
realize we've got a choice.

32
00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:07.375
We can choose to save the Amazon

33
00:02:07.416 --> 00:02:09.291
or we can choose
to lose it forever.

34
00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:12.083
The choice is
right here on our plate.

35
00:02:12.125 --> 00:02:15.666
Many people don't understand
that when they eat meat

36
00:02:15.708 --> 00:02:18.875
in Los Angeles.
California. or New York.

37
00:02:18.916 --> 00:02:21.416
that meat could
have been the result

38
00:02:21.458 --> 00:02:23.458
of deforestation in Brazil.

39
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.333
[Moby] Stop anyone on the street
and ask them.

40
00:02:26.375 --> 00:02:28.625
why are the rainforests
being cut down?

41
00:02:28.666 --> 00:02:32.166
Some of the slightly more aware
people might say palm oil.

42
00:02:32.208 --> 00:02:36.333
but most people would say like.
"Oh. because of wood
for houses."

43
00:02:36.375 --> 00:02:39.458
And they would have no idea
that there's a connection

44
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.458
between animal agriculture
and deforestation.

45
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.833
[Dr. Michael] And it's
all wrapped up in that burger

46
00:02:44.875 --> 00:02:48.416
and for them to sell it
at $2.95 is. is a bargain.

47
00:02:48.458 --> 00:02:51.041
That's our future. That's the.
that's the rainforest.

48
00:02:51.083 --> 00:02:54.291
That's our soil. that's the air.
that's where your children
are going to be growing

49
00:02:54.333 --> 00:02:57.416
their food in the future.
That's really what we're eating.

50
00:02:57.458 --> 00:03:00.625
[Matt] The connection
from the destruction
of the rainforest

51
00:03:00.666 --> 00:03:03.458
to grow soy. to feed animals.

52
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.541
to your burger on the table
or your steak on the table.
it's not easy to track.

53
00:03:07.583 --> 00:03:11.208
When we talk about soy.
people should be clear.
we are not talking about tofu.

54
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.083
We're talking about
a crop that is grown

55
00:03:14.125 --> 00:03:15.541
primarily for animal feed.

56
00:03:15.583 --> 00:03:19.750
About 70% of soy
is grown for animal feed.

57
00:03:19.791 --> 00:03:23.791
as well as other non-direct
food uses like biodiesel.

58
00:03:23.833 --> 00:03:27.041
When we say soy. we really
are talking about meat.

59
00:03:27.083 --> 00:03:29.875
So. the soy that
is grown in the Amazon

60
00:03:29.916 --> 00:03:33.375
primarily goes to the European
and American markets.

61
00:03:33.416 --> 00:03:35.875
They ship the soy overseas.

62
00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:38.291
put them in these
giant machines called crushers.

63
00:03:38.333 --> 00:03:40.500
and turn them
into feed for livestock

64
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:43.458
and then that's used to
produce beef to feed people.

65
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.833
And that's what we buy when.
you know. you go to
fast food chains.

66
00:03:46.875 --> 00:03:48.375
You're basically. in some ways.

67
00:03:48.416 --> 00:03:51.875
eating soy that
was grown in the Amazon

68
00:03:51.916 --> 00:03:53.541
or other parts of South America.

69
00:03:55.291 --> 00:03:56.916
[narrator] Fire
has been used by people

70
00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.916
for thousands of years as a way

71
00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.250
to clear large forested areas.

72
00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:03.625
But why. in this day and age.

73
00:04:03.666 --> 00:04:05.833
are modern farmers still using

74
00:04:05.875 --> 00:04:08.708
this devastating
and unsustainable practice?

75
00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.666
People are burning
the forest to plant soy

76
00:04:11.708 --> 00:04:13.375
because it's
the easiest way to do it.

77
00:04:13.416 --> 00:04:16.166
You can go into an area
that has been undeveloped.

78
00:04:16.208 --> 00:04:19.000
cut it down. burn it. grow soy
and sell it to companies.

79
00:04:19.041 --> 00:04:21.416
Large international corporations

80
00:04:21.458 --> 00:04:22.708
will give you
the funds to do it.

81
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.500
So. when a forest
in the Amazon is

82
00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:29.833
cut and burned. it puts a lot
of nutrients into the soil.

83
00:04:29.875 --> 00:04:32.458
Once the forest is burned down.
you can grow soy in it.

84
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.416
you might be able
to get a crop or two.

85
00:04:34.458 --> 00:04:36.208
but eventually
it's just going to dry out.

86
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.000
Uh. tropical rainforests
aren't. uh. made

87
00:04:39.041 --> 00:04:41.750
to continuously
grow crops in that way.

88
00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:43.750
They generally
will burn the forest.

89
00:04:43.791 --> 00:04:45.416
grow something.
and then move on.

90
00:04:45.458 --> 00:04:48.208
When you have
an entire economic system

91
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.916
that is based on
destroying the rainforest

92
00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.333
and selling it to consumers.

93
00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:54.333
it's going to
take some real agitation

94
00:04:54.375 --> 00:04:55.541
in order to change that.

95
00:04:57.166 --> 00:04:59.791
[narrator] Global warming
is a controversial topic.

96
00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:02.500
but many scientists
believe that deforestation

97
00:05:02.541 --> 00:05:05.125
plays an important role
in the process.

98
00:05:05.166 --> 00:05:09.583
Fewer forests means
more greenhouse gases
entering the atmosphere.

99
00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:13.541
which in turn increases the severity of climate change.

100
00:05:13.583 --> 00:05:15.458
In the Amazon in particular.

101
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.458
and. and other rainforests
as well.

102
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.875
once you cut down
the existing vegetation.

103
00:05:19.916 --> 00:05:22.583
it's not going
to grow back into a rainforest.

104
00:05:22.625 --> 00:05:25.750
it's going to turn into
a much drier type of ecosystem.

105
00:05:25.791 --> 00:05:27.916
a non-native ecosystem.

106
00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.625
and that's going
to be extremely prone to fire

107
00:05:30.666 --> 00:05:32.708
as well as the fact
that all of that carbon

108
00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.458
that had previously
been stored in that forest

109
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.416
has now been
released into the atmosphere.

110
00:05:37.458 --> 00:05:39.125
[Moby] It seems like
climate change.

111
00:05:39.166 --> 00:05:42.333
people are slowly
starting to take it seriously

112
00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:45.333
and one of the ways
to fight climate change

113
00:05:45.375 --> 00:05:48.250
is through carbon sequestration.
Oceans and the rainforests

114
00:05:48.291 --> 00:05:50.875
are the best places
for carbon sequestration.

115
00:05:50.916 --> 00:05:55.041
So. rather than
the tropical rainforest serving

116
00:05:55.083 --> 00:05:58.708
as a carbon sink that keeps
carbon out of the atmosphere

117
00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.083
and helps mitigate
against global warming.

118
00:06:01.125 --> 00:06:02.958
when you cut it down
and burn it.

119
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.708
you're sending
all of that carbon out

120
00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.125
and you're. you're causing
a major emission

121
00:06:07.166 --> 00:06:11.291
of greenhouse gases
in a system that should
be trapping greenhouse gases.

122
00:06:11.333 --> 00:06:15.375
And that has to do. also.
with the amount of emissions
that the cattle produce.

123
00:06:15.416 --> 00:06:17.000
mainly in the amount of methane.

124
00:06:17.041 --> 00:06:19.958
What we have noticed
with the deforestation.

125
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.958
there was actually a change
in the soil microbial community

126
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.458
that also produce
methane or consume methane.

127
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.250
And what we found
is that actually the.

128
00:06:28.291 --> 00:06:30.291
especially
the methane consumers.

129
00:06:30.333 --> 00:06:33.625
is a bacteria that use methane
as their source of carbon.

130
00:06:33.666 --> 00:06:37.250
They are actually significantly
reduced in the soil.

131
00:06:37.291 --> 00:06:40.208
And so suggesting there is
going to be less methane uptake

132
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.041
once the deforestation
has happened.

133
00:06:43.083 --> 00:06:47.875
We actually can significantly
reduce our overall emissions

134
00:06:47.916 --> 00:06:51.125
by eating less meat
or eating no meat whatsoever.

135
00:07:04.416 --> 00:07:06.000
[Glenn] Meat is responsible
for more

136
00:07:06.041 --> 00:07:09.041
climate pollution than
all the cars. ships. trucks.

137
00:07:09.083 --> 00:07:11.208
and planes in the world.
combined.

138
00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.791
This is a really big issue.

139
00:07:12.833 --> 00:07:14.875
and it doesn't
get enough attention.

140
00:07:14.916 --> 00:07:17.791
Deforestation alone. uh.
accounts for something

141
00:07:17.833 --> 00:07:20.750
around 15% of total
global warming pollution.

142
00:07:20.791 --> 00:07:25.375
and yet it gets
just two percent of the funding
to address the climate crisis.

143
00:07:25.416 --> 00:07:28.500
[Moby] I was flying
from Argentina to New York.

144
00:07:28.541 --> 00:07:31.541
and we were flying over
the rainforest and it was
the middle of the night

145
00:07:31.583 --> 00:07:34.041
and I looked at a map.

146
00:07:34.083 --> 00:07:35.458
you know. the little sky map.

147
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.500
and we were
flying over the jungle.

148
00:07:37.541 --> 00:07:39.833
and I looked out the window
and there were just lights
everywhere

149
00:07:39.875 --> 00:07:42.708
and I was trying to figure out
what city we were flying over.

150
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.625
I was like. "Are we
flying over Brasilia?"

151
00:07:44.666 --> 00:07:47.333
Because there was. like.
lights to the horizon.

152
00:07:47.375 --> 00:07:49.250
and I realized they weren't
city lights. they were fires.

153
00:07:50.166 --> 00:07:52.833
And it was everywhere I looked.

154
00:07:52.875 --> 00:07:56.500
there were fires just
burning and burning and burning.

155
00:07:56.541 --> 00:07:59.125
but in lines.
so it was all deforestation.

156
00:07:59.166 --> 00:08:01.750
And just the immensity of that
struck me.

157
00:08:08.291 --> 00:08:10.208
[narrator]
Deforestation also affects

158
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.166
the over two million people
that live in

159
00:08:13.208 --> 00:08:16.208
and depend on the forest for food and shelter.

160
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:19.416
To this day. indigenous populations in Brazil

161
00:08:19.458 --> 00:08:21.500
and other countries
in South America

162
00:08:21.541 --> 00:08:24.125
are still being
kicked out of their lands.

163
00:08:24.166 --> 00:08:26.000
even though
these are public areas

164
00:08:26.041 --> 00:08:29.291
under federal jurisdiction
and protected by law.

165
00:08:29.333 --> 00:08:34.583
In 2018. 135 Indians
were murdered in Brazil

166
00:08:34.625 --> 00:08:37.625
and there have been
over 1.000 registered cases

167
00:08:37.666 --> 00:08:40.458
of violence.
abuse. death threats.

168
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.666
and rape of indigenous people.

169
00:08:42.708 --> 00:08:46.583
The genocide of Indians in Brazil started 500 years ago

170
00:08:46.625 --> 00:08:48.708
when the country
was first colonized

171
00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.583
and it still occurs to this day.

172
00:11:08.125 --> 00:11:12.625
So. there has been very
strong laws in Brazil of late

173
00:11:12.666 --> 00:11:14.583
for the protection
of indigenous territory

174
00:11:14.625 --> 00:11:17.541
that's been identified as
being the traditional territory

175
00:11:17.583 --> 00:11:19.916
and the occupied territory
of indigenous people.

176
00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.791
There is a great fear that
as of the most recent election.

177
00:11:22.833 --> 00:11:25.750
uh. the president of Brazil
has pledged

178
00:11:25.791 --> 00:11:27.666
that he's going
to remove that protection.

179
00:11:27.708 --> 00:11:29.333
One of the crazier things
we heard

180
00:11:29.375 --> 00:11:31.750
from President Bolsonaro
was that he said

181
00:11:31.791 --> 00:11:33.750
he wished that
the Brazilian cavalry

182
00:11:33.791 --> 00:11:36.458
had been as effective
as the American cavalry

183
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.416
and eliminated
more native populations.

184
00:11:39.458 --> 00:11:43.541
The attitude is we want to
get native peoples off the land

185
00:11:43.583 --> 00:11:45.583
so we can bring
in cattle and soy.

186
00:11:45.625 --> 00:11:47.458
which is what progress is.

187
00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.375
I mean. to me. I.
I don't see progress

188
00:11:49.416 --> 00:11:51.750
as converting. uh.
an ancient ecosystem

189
00:11:51.791 --> 00:11:53.916
that provides life
to the whole planet

190
00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:57.000
to a monoculture that
just serves big businesses

191
00:11:57.041 --> 00:11:59.750
as a positive
or as a sign of civilization.

192
00:11:59.791 --> 00:12:02.916
To the contrary. I mean. this is
an abuse that we don't need.

193
00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:06.208
[narrator]
Rainforests provide habitat

194
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.583
to over 80% of plants
and animals living on land.

195
00:12:09.625 --> 00:12:12.625
but deforestation
destroys their habitats

196
00:12:12.666 --> 00:12:14.791
and diminishes biodiversity.

197
00:12:14.833 --> 00:12:18.500
Scientists estimate
that 4.000 to 6.000 species

198
00:12:18.541 --> 00:12:22.500
go extinct every year
due to deforestation alone.

199
00:12:37.541 --> 00:12:39.625
[Moby] The rainforests
are largely

200
00:12:39.666 --> 00:12:42.708
what make this earth
habitable for us.

201
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:44.083
[Matt] Rainforests are
one of the most

202
00:12:44.125 --> 00:12:47.083
biologically diverse
ecosystems in the world.

203
00:12:47.125 --> 00:12:48.708
which means that
there's a lot of animals

204
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:52.625
that live there and only
there in very unique places

205
00:12:52.666 --> 00:12:55.541
and. you know. that-- that's
where they live and they can't
live anywhere else.

206
00:12:55.583 --> 00:12:59.458
and when you cut the forest
down. the animals are gone.
They've got nowhere to go.

207
00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:04.333
This might sound sort of
like a hippie would say this.
but it's actual science.

208
00:13:04.375 --> 00:13:09.500
is our earth is a system.
and nothing exists in isolation.

209
00:13:09.541 --> 00:13:11.916
All life relies on other life

210
00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.083
and it relies on
the sustainability

211
00:13:14.125 --> 00:13:16.333
and health of other ecosystems.

212
00:13:16.375 --> 00:13:19.708
And as humans. we have
this pride in the stupidity

213
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.916
that makes us think that
we can destroy part of the world

214
00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:27.250
and not affect us.
and what we're realizing now
is that's not the case.

215
00:13:27.291 --> 00:13:30.375
When you destroy the rainforest.
you're destroying yourself.

216
00:13:41.583 --> 00:13:44.416
[narrator] The Amazon rainforest is considered by many

217
00:13:44.458 --> 00:13:47.916
to be the largest
natural pharmacy in the world.

218
00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.833
It's home to
an abundance of plants

219
00:13:49.875 --> 00:13:52.083
renowned for
their medical properties

220
00:13:52.125 --> 00:13:56.375
and it's estimated that 25% of all the drugs used today

221
00:13:56.416 --> 00:13:59.250
are derived
from rainforest plants.

222
00:13:59.291 --> 00:14:02.833
The protection of these natural elements is fundamental

223
00:14:02.875 --> 00:14:06.208
to maintaining this incredible
hot spot of biodiversity.

224
00:16:02.208 --> 00:16:04.416
[narrator] It's recognized
that the production of meat

225
00:16:04.458 --> 00:16:08.333
plays a key role
in deforestation
and climate change.

226
00:16:08.375 --> 00:16:10.541
But in recent years.
meat consumption

227
00:16:10.583 --> 00:16:13.500
has also been linked
to numerous chronic diseases.

228
00:16:13.541 --> 00:16:16.458
In 2014.
the World Health Organization

229
00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:20.666
classified processed meat
as a group one carcinogen.

230
00:16:20.708 --> 00:16:23.000
the same category
given to cigarettes.

231
00:16:23.041 --> 00:16:25.208
Red meat was
assigned to group 2A.

232
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.000
when it comes to cancer risk.

233
00:16:27.041 --> 00:16:29.541
the same group
as the pesticide DDT.

234
00:16:31.416 --> 00:16:34.166
Oh. as a physician.
I think one of the best things

235
00:16:34.208 --> 00:16:36.416
people can do
for their health is reduce

236
00:16:36.458 --> 00:16:39.375
their consumption of meat
or eliminate it altogether.

237
00:16:39.416 --> 00:16:42.458
The scientific evidence
is becoming overwhelming

238
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.791
that the more animal muscle
that we consume.

239
00:16:45.833 --> 00:16:49.208
the higher our risk of clogged
arteries and colon cancer

240
00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:51.125
and a host of other diseases.

241
00:16:51.166 --> 00:16:52.916
So. no. I think
the less meat we eat.

242
00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:54.416
the healthier we're going to be.

243
00:17:26.541 --> 00:17:30.250
[Dr. Neal] Not only is meat
consumption linked to
heart disease and to stroke.

244
00:17:30.291 --> 00:17:33.708
but it's also linked
to many of the most common
forms of cancer.

245
00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:36.625
Probably the big standout
is colorectal cancer.

246
00:17:36.666 --> 00:17:39.416
which is a huge killer
in the United States

247
00:17:39.458 --> 00:17:40.958
and in many other countries.

248
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.708
It's the meat itself.

249
00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:45.000
but it's also
the meat-cooking processes.

250
00:17:45.041 --> 00:17:47.041
As meat is
headed up in the oven.

251
00:17:47.083 --> 00:17:49.291
carcinogens form on the meat.

252
00:17:49.333 --> 00:17:51.791
There's a link between meat
and Alzheimer's disease

253
00:17:51.833 --> 00:17:53.625
that came as a huge surprise.

254
00:17:53.666 --> 00:17:56.250
Starting in 1993.
researchers in Chicago

255
00:17:56.291 --> 00:17:58.000
tracked what people were eating

256
00:17:58.041 --> 00:18:00.583
and they tracked who
developed Alzheimer's disease

257
00:18:00.625 --> 00:18:03.250
and who didn't and one of
the first things they discovered

258
00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:07.666
was that the fat that
is predominant in meat.
saturated fat.

259
00:18:07.708 --> 00:18:11.041
could triple your risk
of getting Alzheimer's disease.

260
00:18:11.083 --> 00:18:13.541
Now. the good news is.
if you're not eating it.

261
00:18:13.583 --> 00:18:15.625
then your risk was cut hugely.

262
00:18:42.791 --> 00:18:46.375
[Dr. Michael] It's estimated
that if meat really sold

263
00:18:46.416 --> 00:18:48.375
for what it honestly cost
to produce.

264
00:18:48.416 --> 00:18:49.958
if the beef producers had to pay

265
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.375
for all the water
that irrigates the alfalfa.

266
00:18:53.416 --> 00:18:55.791
that's government subsidized.
that's--

267
00:18:55.833 --> 00:18:58.291
all the water that's polluted
from the slaughterhouse.

268
00:18:58.333 --> 00:19:02.083
all the soil that runs off
the corn and soy bean fields.

269
00:19:02.125 --> 00:19:05.833
all the pesticides and
herbicides that are sprayed
on those grains

270
00:19:05.875 --> 00:19:07.416
that wind up causing cancer.

271
00:19:07.458 --> 00:19:09.416
if they had
to pay for the therapies

272
00:19:09.458 --> 00:19:12.000
of the farm workers
spraying those chemicals.

273
00:19:12.041 --> 00:19:14.125
This is unsustainable.

274
00:19:14.166 --> 00:19:17.333
it's a spectacularly
expensive substance.

275
00:19:17.375 --> 00:19:19.125
animal flesh these days.

276
00:20:03.625 --> 00:20:05.791
[narrator] Small family
farming operations

277
00:20:05.833 --> 00:20:07.416
are often swimming in debt

278
00:20:07.458 --> 00:20:11.125
while agribusiness
conglomerates are thriving.

279
00:20:11.166 --> 00:20:13.833
But despite
not generating many jobs.

280
00:20:13.875 --> 00:20:17.333
destroying the Amazon forest.
and polluting the environment.

281
00:20:17.375 --> 00:20:21.791
big agribusiness receives
billions in tax subsidies.

282
00:20:21.833 --> 00:20:24.083
while small
family farmers receive

283
00:20:24.125 --> 00:20:27.291
on average ten times less
in incentives.

284
00:20:27.333 --> 00:20:29.833
Those same small farms
are responsible

285
00:20:29.875 --> 00:20:34.000
for producing 80% of the food
that feeds the planet.

286
00:20:34.041 --> 00:20:38.416
[Moby] Agribusiness only exists
because of tax subsidies.

287
00:20:38.458 --> 00:20:41.375
You remove all
federal local subsidies

288
00:20:41.416 --> 00:20:43.625
from the production
of animal agriculture.

289
00:20:43.666 --> 00:20:46.208
a pound of beef would cost $100.

290
00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:48.458
A gallon of milk would cost $75.

291
00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.666
A family of four going
to McDonald's without subsidies

292
00:20:51.708 --> 00:20:53.833
would spend $120 on their meal.

293
00:20:53.875 --> 00:20:58.333
So our tax dollars
subsidize an industry

294
00:20:58.375 --> 00:21:00.166
that's destroying our health

295
00:21:00.208 --> 00:21:02.125
and destroying
the health of the planet

296
00:21:02.166 --> 00:21:03.916
and if we speak up about it.

297
00:21:03.958 --> 00:21:06.083
we risk being thrown in jail
and killed.

298
00:21:42.125 --> 00:21:44.000
[narrator] If we
produced and consumed

299
00:21:44.041 --> 00:21:46.875
more plant products
instead of animal products.

300
00:21:46.916 --> 00:21:48.541
this would mitigate much of

301
00:21:48.583 --> 00:21:51.541
the human generated
greenhouse gas emission

302
00:21:51.583 --> 00:21:53.666
and would provide a home
once again

303
00:21:53.708 --> 00:21:56.333
for the countless
wild species displaced

304
00:21:56.375 --> 00:21:58.916
due to animal agriculture
each year.

305
00:21:58.958 --> 00:22:00.791
but reducing
the consumption of meat

306
00:22:00.833 --> 00:22:03.500
often times
makes people concerned.

307
00:22:03.541 --> 00:22:05.458
Will you get enough nutrients?

308
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:06.583
And what about protein?

309
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:37.500
[Dr. Neal] The question often
comes up is to how much of
a diet change do I need to make.

310
00:22:37.541 --> 00:22:41.416
and my answer is any step
you make is a good step.

311
00:22:41.458 --> 00:22:43.833
So. when people reduce
meat consumption. that's good.

312
00:22:43.875 --> 00:22:47.708
That said. I have to say
that when people get it
out of their lives completely.

313
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:50.083
they really get
their diet into high gear

314
00:22:50.125 --> 00:22:52.041
and their. their health
improves dramatically.

315
00:22:52.083 --> 00:22:53.208
but any step is a good step.

316
00:23:16.625 --> 00:23:19.250
[narrator] One
shocking and little-known fact

317
00:23:19.291 --> 00:23:22.083
is that deforestation
increases the prevalence

318
00:23:22.125 --> 00:23:24.416
of diseases all
around the world.

319
00:23:24.458 --> 00:23:28.750
including malaria.
Zika. dengue fever. SARS.

320
00:23:28.791 --> 00:23:32.166
Ebola. leptospirosis.
and many others

321
00:23:32.208 --> 00:23:35.250
because deforestation
changes how and where

322
00:23:35.291 --> 00:23:37.666
these animals
transmit these diseases.

323
00:23:37.708 --> 00:23:39.208
Once their natural habitat

324
00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:41.916
and ecosystem
balance becomes disrupted.

325
00:23:41.958 --> 00:23:45.208
they end up getting
closer to small towns
surrounding those areas.

326
00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:48.750
increasing the chances of transmitting diseases to humans.

327
00:25:16.875 --> 00:25:19.041
[narrator]
Deforestation also affects

328
00:25:19.083 --> 00:25:20.625
the quality of the air.

329
00:25:20.666 --> 00:25:23.416
When tons of harmful
and toxic particles

330
00:25:23.458 --> 00:25:26.333
are released into the atmosphere during these fires.

331
00:25:26.375 --> 00:25:28.541
the particles travel
by wind currents.

332
00:25:28.583 --> 00:25:32.208
and end up affecting not only the local populations.

333
00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:34.333
but people
in the big cities as well.

334
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.166
[narrator] Forests play a key role in local water cycles

335
00:26:50.208 --> 00:26:55.583
by helping to keep a balance
between the water on land and the water in the atmosphere.

336
00:26:55.625 --> 00:26:58.583
But when deforestation
and degradation occur.

337
00:26:58.625 --> 00:27:00.791
that balance can be thrown off.

338
00:27:00.833 --> 00:27:04.333
resulting in changes in
precipitation and river flow.

339
00:27:04.375 --> 00:27:08.458
which affect the climate both
locally and on a global scale.

340
00:28:11.208 --> 00:28:13.958
[Glenn] You're seeing that
all around the world.
the consequence of that

341
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.750
is not only
destruction to the ecosystems.

342
00:28:16.791 --> 00:28:19.333
but actually. uh.
the entire Amazon basin

343
00:28:19.375 --> 00:28:21.833
is having increasing difficulty
supporting agriculture.

344
00:28:21.875 --> 00:28:24.541
It'll be difficult to
maintain the kind of agriculture

345
00:28:24.583 --> 00:28:26.833
that we have now
in just 25 years.

346
00:28:26.875 --> 00:28:29.416
Um. weirdly.
the agribusiness companies

347
00:28:29.458 --> 00:28:32.541
that are financing deforestation
are also imperiling

348
00:28:32.583 --> 00:28:34.708
their own ability
to operate in the long run.

349
00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:37.000
There just won't be enough water

350
00:28:37.041 --> 00:28:39.500
if you don't have
the forest to provide it.

351
00:28:51.375 --> 00:28:53.958
The rainforest
has a lot of rain.

352
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.208
It's a very wet ecosystem

353
00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:58.375
and that rain
and the water cycles through it.

354
00:28:58.416 --> 00:29:00.416
When you cut the forest down.

355
00:29:00.458 --> 00:29:03.208
you're allowing the sun
to penetrate to the ground.

356
00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:07.458
to the vegetation and along
the edge it continues to dry out

357
00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:11.166
and the more people
move into the forest.
cutting away at the edges.

358
00:29:11.208 --> 00:29:13.916
the more that that drying
penetrates into the forest.

359
00:29:13.958 --> 00:29:16.500
The result of that has
been a real dramatic increase

360
00:29:16.541 --> 00:29:17.916
of forest fires in areas

361
00:29:17.958 --> 00:29:19.291
where there never
would have been fire.

362
00:29:19.333 --> 00:29:20.791
They wouldn't
have been fire-prone

363
00:29:20.833 --> 00:29:23.083
because of all
the moisture in the ecosystem.

364
00:29:24.208 --> 00:29:26.666
[narrator] Because the soil in the deforested areas

365
00:29:26.708 --> 00:29:28.791
is usually poor in nutrients.

366
00:29:28.833 --> 00:29:32.541
many farmers are forced to use more resilient GMO crops

367
00:29:32.583 --> 00:29:34.541
that can withstand
harsh conditions

368
00:29:34.583 --> 00:29:36.750
and larger amounts
of pesticides.

369
00:29:36.791 --> 00:29:39.875
but these excess pesticides
end up in the food chain.

370
00:29:39.916 --> 00:29:41.666
The grain is fed to the cattle.

371
00:29:41.708 --> 00:29:43.750
which are then eaten by humans.

372
00:29:43.791 --> 00:29:46.125
Also. the pesticides
run off the fields

373
00:29:46.166 --> 00:29:48.083
to the water beds and rivers.

374
00:29:48.125 --> 00:29:49.750
creating a lot of pollution.

375
00:29:49.791 --> 00:29:53.125
disturbing the ecosystems
and causing disease.

376
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
[Rose] The overuse
of pesticide and fertilizer

377
00:29:56.041 --> 00:29:59.708
is one of the main contaminants
for water pollution.

378
00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:04.958
So. not only are these
crops causing forest loss
and causing climate change.

379
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.708
they're also causing
a local water pollution crisis.

380
00:31:28.041 --> 00:31:29.541
They are
cutting down the forest.

381
00:31:29.583 --> 00:31:31.375
they're changing the ecosystem.

382
00:31:31.416 --> 00:31:33.791
they're dumping
pesticides on the ground.

383
00:31:33.833 --> 00:31:35.375
destroying
the ability of that land

384
00:31:35.416 --> 00:31:37.458
to produce food
for the people around it.

385
00:32:19.166 --> 00:32:21.500
[narrator] Hundreds
of environmental activists

386
00:32:21.541 --> 00:32:23.958
are killed every year
all over the world.

387
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.708
With the majority
being indigenous people.

388
00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:30.250
the Amazon is one of the areas
with the most tension.

389
00:32:30.291 --> 00:32:33.750
Last year. Brazil was once again the deadliest country

390
00:32:33.791 --> 00:32:36.333
for environmentalists
and despite efforts

391
00:32:36.375 --> 00:32:40.250
by national environmental
agencies. justice is rare.

392
00:34:17.916 --> 00:34:20.083
It's become increasingly
dangerous for people

393
00:34:20.125 --> 00:34:23.666
on the ground in a lot
of these countries to resist.

394
00:34:23.708 --> 00:34:26.750
It's become increasingly
dangerous for people
on the ground

395
00:34:26.791 --> 00:34:29.416
to expose what some
of these activities are

396
00:34:29.458 --> 00:34:33.166
and I think that we have
a relative degree of safety

397
00:34:33.208 --> 00:34:37.208
and freedom here and. and
I think that's why it's
incumbent on us

398
00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:41.750
to give voice to the people who.
um. can't speak for themselves
in a lot of these counties.

399
00:35:25.708 --> 00:35:29.791
[Moby] Animal agriculture
is a huge industry

400
00:35:29.833 --> 00:35:32.000
and a hugely powerful industry

401
00:35:32.041 --> 00:35:34.666
and a hugely violent
and destructive industry.

402
00:35:34.708 --> 00:35:36.041
Not just towards the animals.

403
00:35:36.083 --> 00:35:37.458
not just
towards the environment.

404
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.500
but towards activists as well.

405
00:35:39.541 --> 00:35:41.000
I mean.
activists have been killed

406
00:35:41.041 --> 00:35:43.583
for standing up
to cattle ranchers.

407
00:35:43.625 --> 00:35:46.166
But still like.
so many local legislatures

408
00:35:46.208 --> 00:35:50.000
and so many politicians
essentially work
for agribusiness.

409
00:35:57.458 --> 00:35:59.541
[narrator] Our team
went to the state of Bahia

410
00:35:59.583 --> 00:36:01.708
to meet with Ernst Gotsch.

411
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:03.666
a Swiss farmer and researcher

412
00:36:03.708 --> 00:36:06.000
that moved
to Brazil in the 1980s.

413
00:36:06.041 --> 00:36:09.125
For the last 40 years.
Ernst has developed techniques

414
00:36:09.166 --> 00:36:11.541
that combine
agricultural production

415
00:36:11.583 --> 00:36:13.416
with forest regeneration.

416
00:36:13.458 --> 00:36:15.458
By combining aggressive pruning

417
00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:18.041
and innovative
agroforestry techniques.

418
00:36:18.083 --> 00:36:20.375
Ernst showed the world
that degraded areas

419
00:36:20.416 --> 00:36:23.333
can be regenerated
and that the forest

420
00:36:23.375 --> 00:36:26.458
can be exploited
without being destroyed.

421
00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:29.000
The set of principles
and techniques he developed

422
00:36:29.041 --> 00:36:31.625
became globally known
as syntropic farming.

423
00:36:31.666 --> 00:36:34.291
Its practical applications
can be seen

424
00:36:34.333 --> 00:36:37.083
in several large farms
around the world

425
00:36:37.125 --> 00:36:39.291
and on his own property
where he was able

426
00:36:39.333 --> 00:36:42.541
to regenerate over
1.000 acres of degraded land.

427
00:38:14.291 --> 00:38:17.708
[narrator] On the other
side of the country.
one of Ernst Gotsch's students

428
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:19.916
is following in his footsteps

429
00:38:19.958 --> 00:38:24.250
and applying the same principles in his own syntropic farm.

430
00:38:24.291 --> 00:38:27.500
Jua Pereira.
a young biologist and farmer.

431
00:38:27.541 --> 00:38:30.500
shared his thoughts on the
burning of the Amazon forest.

432
00:39:39.333 --> 00:39:41.666
[Henry] The tragedy of this
continued destruction

433
00:39:41.708 --> 00:39:43.708
of the rainforest in Brazil

434
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:45.458
is that it
doesn't need to happen.

435
00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:48.375
That food can be
developed in cleared land.

436
00:39:48.416 --> 00:39:50.666
they don't need
to destroy more rainforest.

437
00:39:50.708 --> 00:39:53.250
It's just a question
of doing what's right.

438
00:39:53.291 --> 00:39:55.458
That might happen
because of government policy.

439
00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:57.666
but it also can very well happen

440
00:39:57.708 --> 00:39:59.708
because the public
is demanding it.

441
00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:02.166
and the consumer
is demanding it as well.

442
00:40:02.208 --> 00:40:05.625
[Glenn] We're talking about
very basic practice changes.

443
00:40:05.666 --> 00:40:09.500
like growing crops on
previously deforested land

444
00:40:09.541 --> 00:40:12.750
instead of burning down
new. uh. rainforest.

445
00:40:12.791 --> 00:40:15.916
Putting cover crops when
there's not corn or soy growing.

446
00:40:15.958 --> 00:40:19.125
Um. having buffer zones
next to waterways.

447
00:40:19.166 --> 00:40:21.166
These are really basic.
affordable things

448
00:40:21.208 --> 00:40:24.166
that often actually make farmers
more money in the long term.

449
00:40:31.166 --> 00:40:33.583
[narrator] Some
agribusinesses in Brazil

450
00:40:33.625 --> 00:40:36.708
are beginning to transition to intensive farming.

451
00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:39.666
which confines
the cattle into smaller areas

452
00:40:39.708 --> 00:40:42.750
and results in less
native forest destruction.

453
00:40:42.791 --> 00:40:45.500
but researchers warn
that intensive farming

454
00:40:45.541 --> 00:40:47.166
comes with its
own set of problems.

455
00:41:59.541 --> 00:42:01.875
[Glenn] I do think that
we. as a society.

456
00:42:01.916 --> 00:42:04.291
need to dramatically
reduce our consumption of meat.

457
00:42:04.333 --> 00:42:06.833
It's both good
for the planet and good for us.

458
00:42:06.875 --> 00:42:10.500
but the big agribusinesses
have a role to play as well

459
00:42:10.541 --> 00:42:13.541
and they should be engaging
in the basic good practices

460
00:42:13.583 --> 00:42:15.916
to hang on to the forest
that we have left

461
00:42:15.958 --> 00:42:19.041
and not to pollute
the already damaged waterways.

462
00:42:21.541 --> 00:42:24.125
[narrator] Our journey
took us to Tucson. Arizona.

463
00:42:24.166 --> 00:42:27.833
home to Biosphere 2. the largest simulated rainforest

464
00:42:27.875 --> 00:42:30.708
research facility in the world.

465
00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:32.791
Biosphere was perhaps best known

466
00:42:32.833 --> 00:42:35.666
for two missions
conducted in the early 1990s.

467
00:42:35.708 --> 00:42:38.500
in which crews were
sealed inside the enclosure

468
00:42:38.541 --> 00:42:40.333
to study survivability.

469
00:42:40.375 --> 00:42:43.250
Nowadays.
Biosphere 2 is home to several

470
00:42:43.291 --> 00:42:46.958
world-renowned scientists who
conduct controlled experiments

471
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.208
in order to study complex environmental questions.

472
00:42:52.208 --> 00:42:55.000
[John] Biosphere 2 is
really a remarkable facility.

473
00:42:55.041 --> 00:42:57.083
It offered a really unique
opportunity

474
00:42:57.125 --> 00:42:59.416
to look at how these
systems respond to changes

475
00:42:59.458 --> 00:43:03.000
like carbon dioxide.
like moisture. like temperature.

476
00:43:03.041 --> 00:43:06.875
and so that began
the shift for Biosphere 2

477
00:43:06.916 --> 00:43:09.250
moving away from
having people live inside.

478
00:43:09.291 --> 00:43:12.500
to moving to one as
a large earth environmental
science laboratory.

479
00:43:12.541 --> 00:43:16.208
Actually. the largest
earth environmental
science laboratory.

480
00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:20.708
It is impossible to think
that we'll ever recreate nature

481
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:22.666
as it occurs naturally outside

482
00:43:22.708 --> 00:43:25.083
and all of its
intricacies and complexities.

483
00:43:25.125 --> 00:43:27.583
and so Biosphere 2
is a test lab.

484
00:43:27.625 --> 00:43:30.416
We can do things like
subject it to a drought.

485
00:43:30.458 --> 00:43:33.333
we predict that the tropics are
going to continue to get warmer
and drier.

486
00:43:33.375 --> 00:43:35.416
well. what's that
mean for those systems?

487
00:43:35.458 --> 00:43:38.166
I think the biggest lesson
so far to come out of Biosphere

488
00:43:38.208 --> 00:43:41.541
is how little we truly
understand earth systems
as a whole.

489
00:43:41.583 --> 00:43:43.916
how those systems
are interconnected.

490
00:43:43.958 --> 00:43:46.416
and how those
systems are impacted

491
00:43:46.458 --> 00:43:49.291
by the changes that
we see coming their way.

492
00:43:49.333 --> 00:43:51.125
We were able
to take our rainforest.

493
00:43:51.166 --> 00:43:53.541
run it through
different levels of CO2

494
00:43:53.583 --> 00:43:56.333
and look at how
its response compared

495
00:43:56.375 --> 00:43:58.416
to those that
the model predicted.

496
00:43:58.458 --> 00:44:00.708
And what we found
is that our system.

497
00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:04.125
like that predicted for the
tropical areas in South America.

498
00:44:04.166 --> 00:44:06.083
it saturated
at about the same level.

499
00:44:06.125 --> 00:44:08.166
What happens when
we surpass this level?

500
00:44:08.208 --> 00:44:11.208
Well. now it means
there's nothing out there

501
00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:13.250
that is absorbing it
or taking the place

502
00:44:13.291 --> 00:44:15.750
of those rainforests
and now rather than that CO2

503
00:44:15.791 --> 00:44:18.458
going up at a particular pace.

504
00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:20.750
now we've accelerated it
significantly.

505
00:44:20.791 --> 00:44:23.916
And so. what we
learn here potentially

506
00:44:23.958 --> 00:44:25.708
has real world applications

507
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:28.416
and regardless
of how much we learn

508
00:44:28.458 --> 00:44:29.791
or how much we think we know.

509
00:44:29.833 --> 00:44:31.666
it's extremely important

510
00:44:31.708 --> 00:44:33.750
to continue to maintain

511
00:44:33.791 --> 00:44:36.125
that biological diversity
in those systems.

512
00:44:36.166 --> 00:44:40.583
because we just don't understand
what the implications

513
00:44:40.625 --> 00:44:42.458
of losing those systems
is going to be.

514
00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:45.333
We have an idea. but I
don't think we fully comprehend.

515
00:44:45.375 --> 00:44:50.625
And we all have an inherent
desire to survive and persist.

516
00:44:50.666 --> 00:44:55.000
and if we're not able to
adapt to changes coming our way.

517
00:44:55.041 --> 00:44:56.958
it often times means.

518
00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.208
when species can't adapt.
you see them go extinct.

519
00:45:10.291 --> 00:45:13.750
[narrator]
Despite the global concern
about the Amazon forest.

520
00:45:13.791 --> 00:45:16.166
most people interested
in helping the cause

521
00:45:16.208 --> 00:45:18.666
feel powerless
due to the distance.

522
00:45:18.708 --> 00:45:21.041
complexity.
and scale of the problem.

523
00:45:21.083 --> 00:45:24.500
So what can we. as regular citizens. do to help?

524
00:45:26.125 --> 00:45:27.500
I think the challenge
that we face

525
00:45:27.541 --> 00:45:29.291
is people may have great concern

526
00:45:29.333 --> 00:45:32.000
about what's happening
in the Amazon or elsewhere.

527
00:45:32.041 --> 00:45:35.083
but people don't know what
to do to act on this concern.

528
00:45:35.125 --> 00:45:36.791
Look. at the individual level.

529
00:45:36.833 --> 00:45:38.541
uh. I think there's
two big things people can do.

530
00:45:38.583 --> 00:45:41.375
One. reduce the amount of
meat that people are eating.

531
00:45:41.416 --> 00:45:44.250
Most people in the developed
world. uh. eat way too much meat

532
00:45:44.291 --> 00:45:46.416
and it's not good for you and
it's not good for the planet.

533
00:45:46.458 --> 00:45:47.833
But the other thing
that we can do

534
00:45:47.875 --> 00:45:50.208
to drive change
on a systematic level

535
00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:52.166
is for consumers
to go talk to the brands

536
00:45:52.208 --> 00:45:54.541
that they patronize
about these issues.

537
00:45:54.583 --> 00:45:58.875
Just sending an email
to the CEO of a big company

538
00:45:58.916 --> 00:46:01.708
linked to deforestation
actually can get heard.

539
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:04.708
but. you know. what's even more
important is if you go on
social media.

540
00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:07.791
send them a message. if you
talk in person to the manager

541
00:46:07.833 --> 00:46:10.500
of a fast food restaurant
or a supermarket chain.

542
00:46:10.541 --> 00:46:14.083
that pretty soon starts to
make its way up the food chain

543
00:46:14.125 --> 00:46:17.333
in the corporation
and they start to say.

544
00:46:17.375 --> 00:46:21.250
"Hey. we're hearing about this.
we're worried that
customers are leaving us

545
00:46:21.291 --> 00:46:23.541
because of our connection
to climate pollution

546
00:46:23.583 --> 00:46:26.083
and to deforestation
and going over to our competitor

547
00:46:26.125 --> 00:46:28.625
who's doing more to deliver
sustainable products."

548
00:46:28.666 --> 00:46:31.166
The only way corporations
become good corporate citizens

549
00:46:31.208 --> 00:46:33.083
is when they're
held accountable by people.

550
00:46:33.125 --> 00:46:35.500
Every corporation in the world.
for the most part.

551
00:46:35.541 --> 00:46:37.833
will get away with
whatever they can get away with.

552
00:46:37.875 --> 00:46:41.375
You know. their goal is to
make their product as cheaply
as possible

553
00:46:41.416 --> 00:46:43.291
and sell it for as much
as possible. you know.

554
00:46:43.333 --> 00:46:45.791
to keep their shareholders
and their board happy.

555
00:46:45.833 --> 00:46:48.500
They will engage in
the worst corporate practices

556
00:46:48.541 --> 00:46:50.166
unless we hold them responsible.

557
00:46:50.208 --> 00:46:52.333
[Glenn] I think what
we found over and over again

558
00:46:52.375 --> 00:46:56.500
is that when consumers bring
urgency around these issues

559
00:46:56.541 --> 00:46:59.250
to companies. they're
actually incredibly responsive.

560
00:46:59.291 --> 00:47:01.291
These companies
value their brands

561
00:47:01.333 --> 00:47:03.708
over any other asset
in their company.

562
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:05.208
so when that brand
is threatened.

563
00:47:05.250 --> 00:47:07.625
when consumers start
to think about their brands

564
00:47:07.666 --> 00:47:10.208
not as a wholesome snack
or meal.

565
00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:14.000
but rather as a driver
of ecological destruction

566
00:47:14.041 --> 00:47:16.083
and human rights abuse
on a vast scale.

567
00:47:16.125 --> 00:47:18.000
that's going to threaten
the value of their company

568
00:47:18.041 --> 00:47:20.708
and that causes
even the most cold-hearted

569
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:23.041
corporate executive
to sit up and pay attention.

570
00:47:23.083 --> 00:47:25.000
We've also found that employees

571
00:47:25.041 --> 00:47:27.125
of these companies
have outsized influence.

572
00:47:27.166 --> 00:47:29.291
So. one of the strongest
voices for change

573
00:47:29.333 --> 00:47:32.208
even in companies that
have done the most damage

574
00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:34.125
is from their own employees.

575
00:47:34.166 --> 00:47:36.166
People increasingly
want to work at companies

576
00:47:36.208 --> 00:47:38.875
where they feel like they're
doing something good
for the world.

577
00:47:38.916 --> 00:47:42.000
Uh. that's true even
of the agribusiness giants.

578
00:47:42.041 --> 00:47:44.916
of fast food chains.
of mainstream supermarkets.

579
00:48:03.291 --> 00:48:06.000
[narrator] In Brazil.
agribusiness is protected

580
00:48:06.041 --> 00:48:09.208
by laws that support
the industry's actions.

581
00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:10.625
but how is this possible?

582
00:48:10.666 --> 00:48:13.208
The people in power
in South America

583
00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:16.125
are often those
with ties to big agribusiness.

584
00:48:16.166 --> 00:48:20.083
Many of the most powerful
politicians in Brazil's
government

585
00:48:20.125 --> 00:48:22.916
are connected to the meat and dairy industries

586
00:48:22.958 --> 00:48:25.791
and they create laws
for their own benefit.

587
00:48:25.833 --> 00:48:27.375
This group of politicians

588
00:48:27.416 --> 00:48:30.458
is called The Ruralista
Congressional Block.

589
00:48:31.416 --> 00:48:34.666
[Glenn] We've seen tremendous
environmental rollbacks
here in our country.

590
00:48:34.708 --> 00:48:37.875
but sadly it doesn't
really compare to what's
happening in Brazil.

591
00:48:37.916 --> 00:48:40.458
Tragically. Brazil
made a huge amount of progress

592
00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:42.958
on reducing deforestation
over the last decade.

593
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.666
Um. they cut deforestation
by more than 2/3

594
00:48:46.708 --> 00:48:49.750
through both private sector
efforts and government action.

595
00:48:49.791 --> 00:48:51.583
They improved
environmental enforcement.

596
00:48:51.625 --> 00:48:54.958
they created both new national
parks and indigenous areas.

597
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000
The big soy and cattle companies

598
00:48:57.041 --> 00:49:00.416
actually took significant
efforts to reduce deforestation

599
00:49:00.458 --> 00:49:02.125
in the Brazilian Amazon
that worked.

600
00:49:02.166 --> 00:49:06.125
Unfortunately. due to issues
unrelated to the environment.

601
00:49:06.166 --> 00:49:09.291
Brazil elected a man
who. in office.

602
00:49:09.333 --> 00:49:11.791
has set about gutting
environmental protections.

603
00:49:29.291 --> 00:49:32.166
[Glenn] I think the biggest
threat to the environment

604
00:49:32.208 --> 00:49:34.541
that we've seen
from the Bolsonaro era so far

605
00:49:34.583 --> 00:49:36.708
hasn't been any specific
policy change.

606
00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:41.250
uh. instead he's given
farmers the sense of impunity

607
00:49:41.291 --> 00:49:44.541
that no matter
how much they deforest.

608
00:49:44.583 --> 00:49:46.916
no matter much illegal activity
they engage in.

609
00:49:46.958 --> 00:49:49.875
no matter how many indigenous
people they displace
from their land.

610
00:49:49.916 --> 00:49:53.125
the government won't
take action and as a result.

611
00:49:53.166 --> 00:49:56.708
we've seen big soy
and cattle ranchers deforest

612
00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:59.041
at probably
an unprecedented scale.

613
00:49:59.083 --> 00:50:04.041
Just this past month.
we saw 1.345 square kilometers

614
00:50:04.083 --> 00:50:06.458
of the Brazilian Amazon
go up in smoke.

615
00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:09.291
Uh. that's an area
the size of Los Angeles

616
00:50:09.333 --> 00:50:11.666
cleared of native vegetation
in just one month.

617
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.250
[Glenn] Uh. one of the things
that Bolsonaro has done

618
00:52:01.291 --> 00:52:04.666
is announce environmental
inspections before they happen.

619
00:52:04.708 --> 00:52:07.625
so that the people
committing crimes can get ready

620
00:52:07.666 --> 00:52:09.833
and try and cover up
the damage that they caused.

621
00:52:09.875 --> 00:52:12.375
It's pretty crazy. but
it's a way that they are trying

622
00:52:12.416 --> 00:52:15.375
to facilitate deforestation
on a mass scale.

623
00:52:15.416 --> 00:52:17.791
What Bolsonaro
is doing is terrible.

624
00:52:17.833 --> 00:52:21.458
but I think for
people all over the world
who are watching this issue.

625
00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:23.833
it's important to understand
that he couldn't do it alone.

626
00:52:23.875 --> 00:52:28.208
It's big companies. uh.
in the soy and cattle industry

627
00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:30.958
that are directly
driving this deforestation.

628
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.500
Industry has an enormous
influence on government policy.

629
00:53:20.416 --> 00:53:22.500
[Glenn] Corruption is
such a massive problem

630
00:53:22.541 --> 00:53:26.125
and we want the big cattle
agribusiness food companies

631
00:53:26.166 --> 00:53:27.333
to stop playing that game.

632
00:53:42.333 --> 00:53:44.791
[narrator] The Amazon problem
often starts

633
00:53:44.833 --> 00:53:46.333
far way from the jungle.

634
00:53:46.375 --> 00:53:48.791
Both American
and international companies

635
00:53:48.833 --> 00:53:53.041
also play a role
in deforestation
by creating demand.

636
00:53:53.083 --> 00:53:54.625
influencing local politics.

637
00:53:54.666 --> 00:53:58.458
and even paying farmers
to destroy the forest.

638
00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:00.666
[Henry] I believe that
industry in the United States

639
00:54:00.708 --> 00:54:04.416
has an enormous impact
on policies of other countries.

640
00:54:04.458 --> 00:54:08.333
Uh. some American businesses
do play a very active role

641
00:54:08.375 --> 00:54:10.875
in the destruction
of the Amazon forest.

642
00:54:10.916 --> 00:54:14.208
One of the major corporations
that operates internationally

643
00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:17.416
is Cargill.
and Cargill is very active

644
00:54:17.458 --> 00:54:21.250
in destroying the rainforest.
uh. to grow different.
uh. crops.

645
00:54:21.291 --> 00:54:24.166
soy is one of the main ones.
in that rainforest.

646
00:55:28.833 --> 00:55:31.416
[Glenn] If these
big companies stopped buying

647
00:55:31.458 --> 00:55:33.458
from producers
engaged in deforestation.

648
00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:35.125
regardless of
who was in government.

649
00:55:35.166 --> 00:55:37.166
uh. there just
wouldn't be the incentive

650
00:55:37.208 --> 00:55:39.125
to engage in
these bad practices.

651
00:55:39.166 --> 00:55:41.833
Large international
corporations.

652
00:55:41.875 --> 00:55:43.333
they're
providing the incentives.

653
00:55:43.375 --> 00:55:45.708
they're providing loans.
they're building infrastructure.

654
00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:48.291
and they're providing the
ability to access the forest.

655
00:55:48.333 --> 00:55:51.500
The farmers will grow it
wherever it will be bought from.

656
00:55:51.541 --> 00:55:53.458
and as long as these companies

657
00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:55.791
continue to pay people
to bulldoze the forest.

658
00:55:55.833 --> 00:55:57.500
they're going
to continue to do it.

659
00:56:14.666 --> 00:56:16.666
[narrator] Farms in Brazil
are very different

660
00:56:16.708 --> 00:56:18.791
from those found
in the U.S. and Europe.

661
00:56:18.833 --> 00:56:21.041
Their sheer size is often larger

662
00:56:21.083 --> 00:56:23.250
than big metropolitan areas.

663
00:56:23.291 --> 00:56:25.291
therefore when we hear
that a farm area

664
00:56:25.333 --> 00:56:28.541
has been cleared for
cattle grazing or growing soy.

665
00:56:28.583 --> 00:56:31.250
the scale of the impact
can be devastating.

666
00:56:32.666 --> 00:56:35.791
When we're talking about
farms in Brazil and farmers.

667
00:56:35.833 --> 00:56:38.250
I think it's important
for people to realize

668
00:56:38.291 --> 00:56:40.666
that this is
on a scale very different

669
00:56:40.708 --> 00:56:42.916
from what you normally see
in the Unites States.

670
00:56:42.958 --> 00:56:46.916
Uh. here in the United States.
you know. 2.000 acres
is a large farm.

671
00:56:46.958 --> 00:56:49.833
in Brazil. it's on
a totally different scale.

672
00:56:49.875 --> 00:56:51.875
Um. you know. what we found
in South America.

673
00:56:51.916 --> 00:56:55.125
we routinely came across
single so-called farms

674
00:56:55.166 --> 00:56:58.625
that were 50.000.
100.000 acres in size

675
00:56:58.666 --> 00:57:02.875
and what that means is that
you had 50.000. 100.000 acres

676
00:57:02.916 --> 00:57:07.083
of forest or other
native habitat for wildlife

677
00:57:07.125 --> 00:57:10.083
just totally cleared
within a matter of months.

678
00:57:10.125 --> 00:57:12.750
We have done
a series of investigations

679
00:57:12.791 --> 00:57:15.750
into who is driving
deforestation in South America.

680
00:57:15.791 --> 00:57:18.750
and we've consistently found
it's a relatively small

681
00:57:18.791 --> 00:57:20.833
handful of companies people
probably haven't heard of.

682
00:57:20.875 --> 00:57:23.958
Cargill. Bonge.
JBS. ADM and a few others.

683
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.125
which are
the leading agribusinesses.

684
00:57:26.166 --> 00:57:29.958
but those companies
depend on markets

685
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.458
from name brand companies.

686
00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:34.125
McDonald's.
Burger King. Stop & Shop.

687
00:57:34.166 --> 00:57:37.041
Giant. Walmart. Mars. Carrefour.

688
00:57:37.083 --> 00:57:40.500
and all the big supermarkets
and fast food chains.

689
00:57:40.541 --> 00:57:43.916
We've asked them
to shift their purchases

690
00:57:43.958 --> 00:57:45.625
to more responsible companies.

691
00:57:45.666 --> 00:57:49.375
So far. all we get
from the big consumer brands

692
00:57:49.416 --> 00:57:52.875
is concern about what's
happening to the forests
of South America.

693
00:57:52.916 --> 00:57:56.125
concern about climate change.
but no discernible action.

694
00:57:56.166 --> 00:57:57.583
[Matt] So we work very closely

695
00:57:57.625 --> 00:57:59.666
with these large
consumer companies

696
00:57:59.708 --> 00:58:02.375
that are buying products
from companies like Cargill.

697
00:58:02.416 --> 00:58:05.041
and there are
a huge number of companies

698
00:58:05.083 --> 00:58:08.791
that we work with. Costco
and Walmart and McDonald's.

699
00:58:08.833 --> 00:58:13.250
that have said that
they don't want rainforest
destruction in their product.

700
00:58:13.291 --> 00:58:15.291
And I think it--
it's time for these companies.

701
00:58:15.333 --> 00:58:17.958
companies like McDonald's.
like Whole Foods.

702
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.250
like Costco.
like Walmart. like Target.

703
00:58:21.291 --> 00:58:23.291
to stop buying
from these companies.

704
00:58:34.416 --> 00:58:38.125
[narrator] Brazil
has many laws set in place
to protect the environment.

705
00:58:38.166 --> 00:58:41.125
but unfortunately
environmental crimes related

706
00:58:41.166 --> 00:58:44.750
to deforestation
are almost inconsequential.

707
00:58:44.791 --> 00:58:47.583
Less than five percent
of the fines are paid

708
00:58:47.625 --> 00:58:50.708
and the one that get paid
are not big enough
to discourage farmers

709
00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:53.208
from continuing
with these criminal practices.

710
00:59:29.666 --> 00:59:33.208
[Glenn] 95% of the environmental
fines that are levied in Brazil

711
00:59:33.250 --> 00:59:35.916
are contested in court
and more often than not.

712
00:59:35.958 --> 00:59:38.833
even egregious deforesters

713
00:59:38.875 --> 00:59:41.083
or people who
displace indigenous people.

714
00:59:41.125 --> 00:59:43.250
which is illegal.
get off scot-free.

715
00:59:43.291 --> 00:59:46.500
[Matt] It's the people who are
on the ground in countries
like Brazil.

716
00:59:46.541 --> 00:59:49.458
they want to make a living
and they want to be
able to feed their family.

717
00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:53.083
I am certain that given the
option they would rather do that

718
00:59:53.125 --> 00:59:55.625
without having
to destroy the rainforest.

719
00:59:55.666 --> 00:59:57.833
but if the only option
that these companies

720
00:59:57.875 --> 01:00:00.416
are giving them
is to earn their living

721
01:00:00.458 --> 01:00:02.208
through this
kind of destruction.

722
01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:03.333
they're going to keep doing it.

723
01:00:03.375 --> 01:00:04.916
They don't have
a lot of choices.

724
01:00:04.958 --> 01:00:08.000
and I think that
maybe they could be providing

725
01:00:08.041 --> 01:00:10.458
the people in Brazil
with a better option

726
01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:13.500
than destroying the land that
they live in in order to eat.

727
01:00:48.958 --> 01:00:52.125
[narrator] One way that farmers
found to go around the system

728
01:00:52.166 --> 01:00:54.875
is through something
called cattle laundering.

729
01:00:54.916 --> 01:00:56.750
which is similar
to money laundering.

730
01:00:56.791 --> 01:00:58.625
The cattle are born in an area

731
01:00:58.666 --> 01:01:00.791
responsible for deforestation.

732
01:01:00.833 --> 01:01:04.541
then they're moved
to a sustainable farm

733
01:01:04.583 --> 01:01:06.583
where they get
branded. fattened.

734
01:01:06.625 --> 01:01:08.791
and sent to
a certified slaughterhouse.

735
01:01:08.833 --> 01:01:13.250
From there. they're sold as
sustainable eco-friendly meat.

736
01:01:13.291 --> 01:01:16.500
It's almost
impossible to be certain

737
01:01:16.541 --> 01:01:19.041
that your meat is not
a result of deforestation.

738
01:01:19.083 --> 01:01:21.083
This method of cattle laundering

739
01:01:21.125 --> 01:01:22.875
has become common place
in the market.

740
01:02:05.541 --> 01:02:07.416
It's really
unlikely that anybody knows

741
01:02:07.458 --> 01:02:09.333
where the meat that
they're eating comes from.

742
01:02:09.375 --> 01:02:11.833
uh. particularly if it's ground
meat. If it's ground meat.

743
01:02:11.875 --> 01:02:14.083
it's coming from
all different kinds of sources.

744
01:02:14.125 --> 01:02:17.458
often just from one company.
but they're sourcing
different parts of the meat

745
01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:19.916
from different companies.
from different countries.

746
01:02:19.958 --> 01:02:21.750
and. uh. mixing it all together

747
01:02:21.791 --> 01:02:23.375
to get the content
they're looking for.

748
01:02:30.666 --> 01:02:32.291
[narrator]
Brazil is also the home

749
01:02:32.333 --> 01:02:35.291
to great environmental
and social initiatives.

750
01:02:35.333 --> 01:02:39.375
It has the largest Meatless
Mondays campaign in the world.

751
01:02:39.416 --> 01:02:41.833
and recently
the city of Sao Paolo

752
01:02:41.875 --> 01:02:43.416
implemented Meatless Mondays

753
01:02:43.458 --> 01:02:45.791
in all public
schools in the region.

754
01:06:13.541 --> 01:06:16.416
[narrator] When it comes
to the Amazon forest fires.

755
01:06:16.458 --> 01:06:18.708
one indirect
victim is rarely mentioned.

756
01:06:19.583 --> 01:06:23.250
Every year over 50 million
farm animals are raised

757
01:06:23.291 --> 01:06:26.500
and killed for meat production
in Brazil alone.

758
01:06:26.541 --> 01:06:29.500
A fact that not only
results in deforestation.

759
01:06:29.541 --> 01:06:33.041
water pollution. and
emission of greenhouse gases.

760
01:06:33.083 --> 01:06:36.750
but also results in the loss
of millions of animals' lives.

761
01:09:12.333 --> 01:09:15.500
[narrator] It's not only the
Amazon forest that's burning.

762
01:09:15.541 --> 01:09:19.750
Australia. California.
Indonesia. Russia. Congo.

763
01:09:19.791 --> 01:09:21.916
and several
other parts of the world

764
01:09:21.958 --> 01:09:24.000
are experiencing
the most destructive

765
01:09:24.041 --> 01:09:26.041
and devastating
fires in decades.

766
01:09:27.125 --> 01:09:30.500
Many of these fires are
exacerbated by global warming.

767
01:09:30.541 --> 01:09:32.583
The Amazon fires in particular

768
01:09:32.625 --> 01:09:35.833
are part of a complex problem
involving politics.

769
01:09:35.875 --> 01:09:38.500
big business.
and prolific corruption.

770
01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:41.250
The political landscape
is complicated.

771
01:09:41.291 --> 01:09:43.416
The agro industry
is very powerful.

772
01:09:43.458 --> 01:09:45.458
and challenging
these dominant forces

773
01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:47.041
can be dangerous and difficult.

774
01:09:48.041 --> 01:09:51.041
There is certainly a great deal of work to be done.

775
01:09:51.083 --> 01:09:53.541
and there are many brave people
fighting in the trenches

776
01:09:53.583 --> 01:09:55.625
to change these systems.

777
01:09:55.666 --> 01:09:58.041
But fortunately for you and I.

778
01:09:58.083 --> 01:10:00.625
we have the power
to create positive change

779
01:10:00.666 --> 01:10:02.375
for the Amazon forest.

780
01:10:02.416 --> 01:10:04.250
Each of us as individuals

781
01:10:04.291 --> 01:10:06.833
is empowered
to protect the Amazon.

782
01:10:06.875 --> 01:10:10.416
and that power lies at the end
of our knives and forks.

783
01:10:10.458 --> 01:10:11.916
because we can make choices

784
01:10:11.958 --> 01:10:13.875
when it comes
to the food we eat.

785
01:10:13.916 --> 01:10:15.500
By reducing or eliminating

786
01:10:15.541 --> 01:10:17.875
the consumption
of meat in our diets.

787
01:10:17.916 --> 01:10:20.916
not only are we helping
to prevent climate change.

788
01:10:20.958 --> 01:10:23.583
but we are also
protecting the Amazon forest

789
01:10:23.625 --> 01:10:26.125
for present and future generations to come.

790
01:10:45.708 --> 01:10:47.791
It's a frightening time.
frankly. uh.

791
01:10:47.833 --> 01:10:50.875
but I think that people can
change and when change happens.

792
01:10:50.916 --> 01:10:52.666
it generally happens
pretty quickly.

793
01:10:52.708 --> 01:10:54.625
and I think we're
reaching a turning point.

794
01:10:54.666 --> 01:10:57.166
and we're really hoping.
and we're banking on the fact

795
01:10:57.208 --> 01:10:59.833
that now that things
have gotten to this point.

796
01:10:59.875 --> 01:11:01.625
people are going
to change their behaviors

797
01:11:01.666 --> 01:11:04.791
and we're going to be
able to turn things around.

798
01:11:04.833 --> 01:11:08.333
There's this interesting
fallacy in philosophy.

799
01:11:08.375 --> 01:11:10.416
it's called
"the is-ought fallacy."

800
01:11:10.458 --> 01:11:14.458
and what it basically
means is to justify something

801
01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:19.708
that you're doing
because it's been done is wrong.
and we can see that very easily.

802
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:22.500
Like. so. on one hand. people
look at animal agriculture.

803
01:11:22.541 --> 01:11:24.250
and they say. "Well.
people have always eaten meat."

804
01:11:24.291 --> 01:11:25.791
And I would say. "Yeah. but.

805
01:11:25.833 --> 01:11:27.833
like. women used to not
be allowed to vote."

806
01:11:27.875 --> 01:11:31.625
We can very clearly see
how logically. ethically
that's completely wrong.

807
01:11:31.666 --> 01:11:33.458
We used to be able
to smoke on airplanes.

808
01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:37.375
We keep making progress
and progress involves

809
01:11:37.416 --> 01:11:41.875
rejecting a past that we now
deem to be unethical and wrong.

810
01:11:41.916 --> 01:11:43.583
and the next thing we have to do

811
01:11:43.625 --> 01:11:46.000
is reject the use
of animals for food.

812
01:11:46.041 --> 01:11:47.958
For the animals. for us.

813
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.500
and for this only home
that we have.

814
01:11:50.541 --> 01:11:53.750
In our clinic. when people
learn to change their diets.

815
01:11:53.791 --> 01:11:55.916
they're replacing
the meat with healthier foods.

816
01:11:55.958 --> 01:11:57.250
their health rebounds.

817
01:11:57.291 --> 01:11:58.541
It's amazing to see.

818
01:11:58.583 --> 01:12:00.041
Their lives are changed.

819
01:12:00.083 --> 01:12:01.250
The earth is the same way.

820
01:12:01.291 --> 01:12:03.750
that when we
change our eating habits.

821
01:12:03.791 --> 01:12:06.583
globally. the environment
can rebound.

822
01:12:06.625 --> 01:12:08.083
the forests can regrow.

823
01:12:08.125 --> 01:12:10.541
We don't have to wait.
we can do that now.

824
01:12:10.583 --> 01:12:11.750
I say let's put it to work.
