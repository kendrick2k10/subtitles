00:12:21.053 --> 00:12:22.153
Name five celebrities

175
00:12:22.255 --> 00:12:24.221
who got their start
in horror movies.

176
00:12:24.323 --> 00:12:26.960
There's Jamie Lee Curtis.
John Travolta.

177
00:12:27.062 --> 00:12:29.794
Demi Moore.
Brooke Shields. and...

178
00:12:29.896 --> 00:12:32.903
Maxine-fucking-Minx.

179
00:12:33.634 --> 00:12:35.365
I got it.

180
00:12:35.467 --> 00:12:38.873
- No shit?
<i>- Puritan II</i> . I fucking got it.

181
00:12:38.975 --> 00:12:40.845
Look. <i>Puritan</i>
is a future classic

182
00:12:40.947 --> 00:12:43.009
as far as ultra-violent
satanic possession movies go.

183
00:12:43.111 --> 00:12:44.815
Not exactly
<i>Terms of Endearment.</i>

184
00:12:44.917 --> 00:12:47.113
but in 30 years. we'll see
which one has more fans.

185
00:12:47.216 --> 00:12:49.348
Elizabeth Bender
is a very underrated director.

186
00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:51.949
My agent thinks it's gonna
make me a crossover star.

187
00:12:52.051 --> 00:12:53.418
Like Marilyn Chambers.

188
00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.595
Mmm. no. She's not a star.
Brooke Shields is a star.

189
00:12:57.697 --> 00:13:01.130
Mmm. Brooke Shields
didn't do porn.

190
00:13:01.232 --> 00:13:02.464
So?

191
00:13:02.566 --> 00:13:03.635
She still got naked

192
00:13:03.737 --> 00:13:05.562
and now she's
in a fucking Muppet movie.

193
00:13:06.766 --> 00:13:08.004
True.

194
00:13:08.106 --> 00:13:11.709
This is gonna be my head soon.
Leon. Just you watch.

195
00:13:11.812 --> 00:13:13.478
I'll organize the pizza
and champagne

196
00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.280
for America's
new scream queen.

197
00:13:15.382 --> 00:13:16.815
That's why I like you.

198
00:13:17.611 --> 00:13:18.715
Oh.

199
00:13:18.817 --> 00:13:20.451
You like me
because I'm the only guy

200
00:13:20.553 --> 00:13:22.048
who isn't trying to fuck you.

201
00:13:24.588 --> 00:13:26.858

Hey. thanks for waiting.

215
00:15:52.599 --> 00:15:54.266
I don't like walking out here
alone at night

216
00:15:54.368 --> 00:15:55.702
with that fricking
Night Stalker guy

217
00:15:55.804 --> 00:15:56.739
on the loose.

218
00:15:56.841 --> 00:15:58.039
You see about it on the news?

219
00:15:58.141 --> 00:15:59.739
They're saying
it's devil worship.

220
00:15:59.841 --> 00:16:01.078
I don't know.

221
00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:03.440
It's all way too close
for comfort. if you ask me.

222
00:16:03.542 --> 00:16:04.681
Then again.
I guess nobody would've

223
00:16:04.783 --> 00:16:05.850
ever heard of Elizabeth Short

224
00:16:05.952 --> 00:16:08.613
if it wasn't for
the Black Dahlia. you know?

225
00:16:10.757 --> 00:16:11.954
I know a killer
after-hours spot

226
00:16:12.056 --> 00:16:13.185
in the hills.
if you're interested.

227
00:16:13.287 --> 00:16:15.287
- No. I gotta get up early.

228
00:16:15.389 --> 00:16:18.059
I hate going to parties
by myself.

229
00:16:18.161 --> 00:16:19.464
Ooh. let me get a hot dog
real quick

230
00:16:19.566 --> 00:16:21.065
so nobody sees me eat.

231
00:16:21.933 --> 00:16:23.766
How come
you're waking up early?

232
00:16:23.868 --> 00:16:25.296
I have a fitting for a film.

233
00:16:25.398 --> 00:16:27.731
Oh. yeah?
Guy-girl or girl-girl?

234
00:16:28.441 --> 00:16:29.634
A real movie.

235
00:16:30.839 --> 00:16:31.906
No kidding?

236
00:16:32.008 --> 00:16:34.111
I didn't know you could act.

237
00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.476
Congrats.

238
00:16:37.478 --> 00:16:39.014
I'm just dying
for some good news like that

239
00:16:39.116 --> 00:16:40.982
- of my own. you know?
- It'll come.

240
00:16:41.084 --> 00:16:43.250
- You just gotta work hard.
- Yeah.

241
00:16:43.352 --> 00:16:45.548
I got a friend
who's in straight pictures.

242
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:48.290
It pays for shit
compared to fuck flicks.

243
00:16:49.024 --> 00:16:50.286
Not if you're at the top.

244
00:16:50.388 --> 00:16:52.195
What kind of movie is it?

245
00:16:53.025 --> 00:16:54.230
Horror.

246
00:16:54.961 --> 00:16:56.429
Honey.

247
00:16:56.531 --> 00:16:59.499
You're not going to the top
in no horror movie.

248
00:17:03.074 --> 00:17:04.669
You sure you don't
want to tag along?

249
00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:07.438
The house is
absolutely fabulous.

250
00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:09.144
It's right under
the Hollywood sign.

251
00:17:09.246 --> 00:17:10.779
I hear you gotta
take a gondola to get there.

252
00:17:10.881 --> 00:17:13.480
Real cosmopolitan shit.

253
00:17:15.587 --> 00:17:16.983
Okay. Your loss.

254
00:17:17.085 --> 00:17:18.954
Be careful walking home.

255
00:17:19.056 --> 00:17:21.386
- I can handle myself.
- Mmm-hmm.

256
00:17:21.488 --> 00:17:24.359
So said every dead girl
in Hollywood.

257
00:17:46.846 --> 00:17:49.053
<i>Authorities

258
00:17:49.155 --> 00:17:52.018

<i>outside at nighttime.</i>

265
00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.507
Fuck.

266
00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.495
- You can run.

267
00:19:07.997 --> 00:19:09.799
And you can hide.

268
00:19:09.901 --> 00:19:12.401
But you'll never get away.

269
00:19:18.745 --> 00:19:21.610
- Drop it!

270
00:19:21.712 --> 00:19:22.873
Buster.

271
00:19:25.247 --> 00:19:26.946
What were you gonna do. huh?

272
00:19:27.048 --> 00:19:28.648
Nothing. I...

273
00:19:30.185 --> 00:19:32.217
I was just playing around.

274
00:19:32.319 --> 00:19:33.851
Well. we're playing now.

275
00:19:34.692 --> 00:19:35.721
Strip.

276
00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:38.526
What?

277
00:19:39.291 --> 00:19:40.726
Strip naked.

278
00:20:00.686 --> 00:20:01.813
On your knees.

279
00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:13.726
Suck.

280
00:20:34.548 --> 00:20:36.082
- On the ground.

281
00:20:36.184 --> 00:20:38.256
Face down. ass up.

282
00:20:42.228 --> 00:20:44.894
Do you know what happened
to the last person

283
00:20:44.996 --> 00:20:46.792
who tried to kill me?

284
00:20:50.167 --> 00:20:53.997
I crushed her fucking head.

285
00:23:03.067 --> 00:23:04.435
What's that?

286
00:23:04.969 --> 00:23:06.030
Nothing.

287
00:23:19.215 --> 00:23:20.610
You good?

288
00:23:20.712 --> 00:23:22.145
Yeah. I'm fine.

289
00:23:23.515 --> 00:23:24.752
All right.

290
00:23:26.387 --> 00:23:28.187
I'm gonna head home.

291
00:23:28.289 --> 00:23:29.559
Okay.

292
00:23:56.814 --> 00:23:58.782
Before we go any further.

293
00:23:58.884 --> 00:24:01.653
money talks
and bullshit walks.

294
00:24:01.755 --> 00:24:03.827
Now you asked me
to find that girl.

295
00:24:03.929 --> 00:24:04.922
which I did.

296
00:24:05.025 --> 00:24:07.495
but whatever sick shit
you got planned next.

297
00:24:07.597 --> 00:24:08.958
that's more
than we bargained for.

298
00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:11.628
so if you still
need my help out here.

299
00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:13.669
the price has gone up.

300
00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.329
No!
No. no. no.

301
00:25:15.431 --> 00:25:19.068
Please! Please! Please!

302
00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:29.344
Oh. my God! Please!

303
00:25:29.446 --> 00:25:32.242
Please. I didn't do anything.

304
00:25:34.453 --> 00:25:35.481
I'll do anything
you want.

305
00:25:35.583 --> 00:25:37.313
Please. just let me go!

306
00:26:26.335 --> 00:26:28.297
Okay.

307
00:26:28.399 --> 00:26:30.668
So I'm gonna be making
a lifecast of your head

308
00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:32.269
for the end of the movie.

309
00:26:32.904 --> 00:26:34.271
Ever had one done before?

310
00:26:37.114 --> 00:26:38.513
Uh. no.

311
00:26:38.615 --> 00:26:39.880
There's nothing to it.

312
00:26:39.982 --> 00:26:41.916
All you have to do
is sit still for ten minutes.

313
00:26:46.989 --> 00:26:50.892
That's a pretty bitchin' scar.
How'd you get it?

314
00:26:51.591 --> 00:26:53.192
I got shot.

315
00:26:53.627 --> 00:26:56.733
Dang. Who shot you?

316
00:26:59.171 --> 00:27:01.166
It's a long story.

317
00:27:05.044 --> 00:27:06.039
All right.

318
00:27:07.678 --> 00:27:09.739
I'm gonna put this
over your head now

319
00:27:09.841 --> 00:27:11.011
to make the mold.

320
00:27:19.285 --> 00:27:23.386
Like I said. it'll take about
10 minutes to set.

321
00:27:25.356 --> 00:27:28.094
I'm gonna run.
I'm gonna get more bandages.

322
00:27:29.961 --> 00:27:31.266
- Sit tight.

323
00:27:31.368 --> 00:27:33.334
Remember to breathe.

324
00:27:33.436 --> 00:27:34.837
I'll be right back.

325
00:28:19.649 --> 00:28:21.043
You'll end up just like me.

326
00:29:14.502 --> 00:29:15.264
Hey. hey!

327
00:29:15.366 --> 00:29:18.066
- Are you okay?

328
00:29:18.168 --> 00:29:20.172
Breathe. Calm down.

329
00:29:20.274 --> 00:29:22.978
- Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

330
00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:24.942
Breathe. Come on.

331
00:29:25.045 --> 00:29:27.011
- Breathe.

332
00:29:36.956 --> 00:29:38.524
Good morning. detectives.

333
00:29:38.626 --> 00:29:39.797
Here you go.

334
00:29:43.834 --> 00:29:46.363
Well. we got two bodies.
both female.

335
00:29:46.465 --> 00:29:48.330
A couple of homos
cruising Judy Garland's grave

336
00:29:48.432 --> 00:29:49.867
found them floating
in the duck pond.

337
00:29:49.969 --> 00:29:51.435
It's pretty gnarly stuff.

338
00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:54.937
We were thinking it could be
The Night Stalker again.

339
00:29:55.039 --> 00:29:57.441
Thinking or hoping?

340
00:30:00.218 --> 00:30:01.181
Jesus.

341
00:30:02.749 --> 00:30:03.920
Fresh meat.

342
00:30:05.283 --> 00:30:06.689
They haven't been here
very long.

343
00:30:06.791 --> 00:30:09.288
I'd say five or six hours
at the most.

344
00:30:11.428 --> 00:30:12.993
Pretty girls.

345
00:30:13.096 --> 00:30:15.428
- I hate to see it.

346
00:30:16.298 --> 00:30:18.902
Looks like they did that
with a fucking cattle prod.

347
00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:23.203
Here.

348
00:30:31.108 --> 00:30:33.147
He marked them both.

349
00:30:59.575 --> 00:31:01.210
Miss Minx?

350
00:31:02.647 --> 00:31:05.013
I was told to give you this.

351
00:31:05.115 --> 00:31:08.044
It's your copy of the script
and a prep schedule.

352
00:31:08.146 --> 00:31:09.280
And Liz. the director.

353
00:31:09.383 --> 00:31:11.383
wants you back on the lot
today for a meeting.

354
00:31:12.651 --> 00:31:17.222
Just a word of warning.
she can be pretty frightening.

355
00:31:17.325 --> 00:31:20.255
I've seen her blow a gasket
more than once.

356
00:31:20.358 --> 00:31:22.628
- Okay.
- Uh. I love your work.

357
00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:23.967
by the way.

358
00:32:13.412 --> 00:32:15.277
No more smut!

359
00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:17.015
- No more smut!

360
00:32:17.118 --> 00:32:19.653
No more smut!
No more smut!

361
00:32:21.921 --> 00:32:23.320
Who is this?

362
00:32:23.422 --> 00:32:25.224
<i>Unless you want
to find yourself</i>

363
00:32:25.327 --> 00:32:27.896
<i>rotting away back in some
Texas jailhouse.</i>

364
00:32:27.998 --> 00:32:30.328
<i>you will meet me
on the 34th floor</i>

365
00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:33.366
<i>of the Bonaventure Hotel
in one hour...</i>

366
00:32:33.966 --> 00:32:35.471
<i>Miss Miller.</i>

367
00:33:09.434 --> 00:33:11.137
Hell of a view.
don't you think?

368
00:33:11.239 --> 00:33:13.135
A long way
from the Howard Johnson's.

369
00:33:13.237 --> 00:33:14.303
I can tell you that.

370
00:33:14.405 --> 00:33:17.177
Nowhere to hide from up here.

371
00:33:17.279 --> 00:33:21.511
Oh. say. ain't you
that dirty movie actress?

372
00:33:21.614 --> 00:33:24.054
Why. you look
a whole lot taller in person.

373
00:33:24.156 --> 00:33:27.618
I guess I've only ever
seen you lying on your back.

374
00:33:28.119 --> 00:33:29.089
John Labat.

375
00:33:29.191 --> 00:33:30.153
Charmed to make
your acquaintance.

376
00:33:30.255 --> 00:33:32.755
- What do you want?
- Oh.

377
00:33:33.729 --> 00:33:35.194
Easy. tiger.

378
00:33:35.296 --> 00:33:36.829
Don't go shooting
the messenger now.

379
00:33:36.931 --> 00:33:39.099
I'm just the dick.

380
00:33:39.201 --> 00:33:41.797
Private detective
hired to find you.

381
00:33:42.671 --> 00:33:43.733
By who?

382
00:33:43.835 --> 00:33:47.702
Well. that right there.
that's privileged information.

383
00:33:47.805 --> 00:33:50.978
My employer would prefer
to reveal it his self.

384
00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:52.915
He's got a...
how do I say this?

385
00:33:53.017 --> 00:33:57.216
A flair for the dramatic.
so to speak.

386
00:33:57.318 --> 00:33:58.513
Is everything all right
over here?

387
00:33:58.615 --> 00:34:00.250
Oh. yeah.
We're just fine. darling.

388
00:34:00.353 --> 00:34:02.089
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

389
00:34:02.191 --> 00:34:03.659
Say. you want
something to drink?

390
00:34:03.761 --> 00:34:06.129
I'm on an expense account.

391
00:34:07.497 --> 00:34:09.062
No?

392
00:34:09.164 --> 00:34:11.799
I guess we'll just
take the bill

393
00:34:11.901 --> 00:34:13.532
when you get a chance.

394
00:34:19.544 --> 00:34:21.042
Wayne Gilroy.

395
00:34:21.144 --> 00:34:23.814
Bobby-Lynne Parker.
R.J. Nichols.

396
00:34:23.916 --> 00:34:27.084
Lorraine Day.
and Jackson Hollis.

397
00:34:27.186 --> 00:34:31.250
Hearing those names
bring up any memories for you?

398
00:34:31.352 --> 00:34:33.320
What about
Howard and Pearl Douglas?

399
00:34:33.422 --> 00:34:36.718
You know they never did catch
who murdered them.

400
00:34:36.821 --> 00:34:41.194
See. the past ain't finished
with you. Maxine.

401
00:34:41.296 --> 00:34:43.393
It's gonna keep
knocking at your door

402
00:34:43.495 --> 00:34:45.861
until you open up
and let it in.

403
00:34:47.671 --> 00:34:48.666
Thank you.

404
00:34:55.475 --> 00:34:58.177
I'm not saying
I had anything to do

405
00:34:58.279 --> 00:35:01.115
with what happened
to those people.

406
00:35:01.217 --> 00:35:04.514
But even if I did.
which I didn't.

407
00:35:04.616 --> 00:35:08.825
there's no way anyone
can pin it on me.

408
00:35:08.927 --> 00:35:11.691
Are you absolutely
certain of that?

409
00:35:13.795 --> 00:35:15.126
Tell me.

410
00:35:15.228 --> 00:35:16.859
Does it weigh on you?

411
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.696
As a Christian. I mean?

412
00:35:19.798 --> 00:35:22.133
That you survived.
and then your friends didn't.

413
00:35:22.235 --> 00:35:23.667
Now I'm an atheist myself.

414
00:35:23.769 --> 00:35:26.205
but I reckon that that
kind of guilt...

415
00:35:26.307 --> 00:35:28.472
that would just crush me
to pieces.

416
00:35:28.574 --> 00:35:31.310
But I guess
it's not show friends.

417
00:35:31.412 --> 00:35:34.712
It's show business.
now isn't it?

418
00:35:36.017 --> 00:35:37.612
How much you want?

419
00:35:37.714 --> 00:35:39.755
Oh. no.
This ain't about money.

420
00:35:39.857 --> 00:35:40.816
Everything's about money.

421
00:35:40.918 --> 00:35:43.485
For a couple of whores
like you and me. maybe so.

422
00:35:43.588 --> 00:35:45.589
Not my employer. nope.
Mmm-mmm.

423
00:35:45.691 --> 00:35:48.359
You can't buy your way
out of retribution.

424
00:35:48.461 --> 00:35:52.194
There's a little soiree
tonight

425
00:35:52.296 --> 00:35:54.102
at this address.

426
00:35:54.204 --> 00:35:57.669
It has been requested
that you attend.

427
00:36:00.139 --> 00:36:02.011
If I don't?

428
00:36:02.113 --> 00:36:05.074
Well. how does
that old saying go?

429
00:36:05.776 --> 00:36:08.647
"You'll never work
in this town again."

430
00:36:10.419 --> 00:36:14.022
Honestly. I don't really care
what you do.

431
00:36:14.124 --> 00:36:15.891
My check's gonna
clear either way.

432
00:36:15.993 --> 00:36:18.588
but I wouldn't recommend it.

433
00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:21.160
My employer is
a very powerful man.

434
00:36:21.262 --> 00:36:22.791
Don't play chicken with him.

435
00:36:22.893 --> 00:36:25.364
I would hate to see
that lost movie of yours

436
00:36:25.466 --> 00:36:28.365
wind up
all over the nightly news.

437
00:36:28.467 --> 00:36:31.040
Contrary to popular belief.

438
00:36:31.142 --> 00:36:33.903
there is such a thing
as bad press.

439
00:37:15.951 --> 00:37:17.386
Maxine Minx?

440
00:37:19.624 --> 00:37:20.515
Yeah?

441
00:37:20.617 --> 00:37:22.057
I'm Detective Williams.

442
00:37:22.159 --> 00:37:25.027
This is Detective Torres.
LAPD.

443
00:37:25.129 --> 00:37:26.857
Do you have time
for a quick chat?

444
00:37:27.796 --> 00:37:28.626
Why?

445
00:37:28.728 --> 00:37:30.196
Oh. we just want
to find out if you've seen

446
00:37:30.298 --> 00:37:31.768
some people we're looking for.

447
00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:32.628
Could we come inside?

448
00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:34.436
We won't take
but five minutes.

449
00:37:36.007 --> 00:37:37.768
I get it. You're in show biz.

450
00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:39.903
You know what? I'm just gonna
cut to the chase.

451
00:37:41.142 --> 00:37:42.741
Have you. uh...

452
00:37:44.014 --> 00:37:45.243
Do you know these girls?

453
00:37:45.345 --> 00:37:47.646
Amber James. Tabby Martin.

454
00:37:47.748 --> 00:37:51.546
We understand they're
work colleagues of yours.

455
00:37:51.648 --> 00:37:53.520
for lack of a better word.

456
00:37:53.622 --> 00:37:55.956
We also know that
you're one of the last people

457
00:37:56.058 --> 00:37:57.426
to have seen them.

458
00:37:59.128 --> 00:38:00.594
Did something happen?

459
00:38:01.894 --> 00:38:05.302
Any information you have
could be really helpful.

460
00:38:06.831 --> 00:38:09.933
They are your friends.
aren't they?

461
00:38:16.013 --> 00:38:17.644
I don't talk to police.

462
00:38:22.846 --> 00:38:24.980
Hmm. You fucked that up.
not me.

463
00:38:25.082 --> 00:38:27.754
- What do you mean?
- All that bullshit bravado.

464
00:38:27.856 --> 00:38:31.555
No wonder you never
made it as an actor.

465
00:38:31.657 --> 00:38:33.093
I thought
I was pretty convincing.

466
00:38:33.195 --> 00:38:34.991
Oh. please.

467
00:39:02.559 --> 00:39:04.392
Is there a way to find out
who made this tape?

468
00:39:04.495 --> 00:39:07.397
- Why. what's on it?
- None of your business.

469
00:39:13.768 --> 00:39:15.399
There's nothing that'll
tell you who recorded it

470
00:39:15.501 --> 00:39:16.535
or where it was duped.

471
00:39:16.637 --> 00:39:19.842
but the tape was made
by Quantegy.

472
00:39:19.944 --> 00:39:20.802
Not a popular brand.

473
00:39:20.904 --> 00:39:22.342
Usually. you see
Japanese companies

474
00:39:22.444 --> 00:39:25.213
like Sony. Fuji
or TDK nowadays.

475
00:39:25.315 --> 00:39:27.916
I can check some
old order forms

476
00:39:28.018 --> 00:39:28.878
and call around

477
00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:31.053
to see what region
it's still being sold in.

478
00:39:31.156 --> 00:39:33.489
- Best I can think of.
- Thanks.

479
00:39:35.993 --> 00:39:37.724
Yeah. no problem.

480
00:39:49.274 --> 00:39:50.239
<i>The survivor</i>

481
00:39:50.341 --> 00:39:51.769
<i>of the brutal attack
last night</i>

482
00:39:51.872 --> 00:39:53.569
<i>believes it to have been
The Night Stalker</i>

483
00:39:53.671 --> 00:39:54.939
<i>who is responsible.</i>

484
00:39:55.041 --> 00:39:57.677
<i>Authorities are following
all witness testimonies</i>

485
00:39:57.779 --> 00:40:00.048
<i>in hopes of zeroing in
on the identity of this</i>

486
00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:01.150
<i>vicious serial killer...</i>

487
00:40:02.554 --> 00:40:04.849
<i>who has already claimed
the lives of eight victims</i>

488
00:40:04.951 --> 00:40:07.083
<i>- in the Los Angeles area.
- </i>

489
00:40:11.655 --> 00:40:12.823
Can I help you?

490
00:40:12.925 --> 00:40:15.292
I'm here to see
Elizabeth Bender.

491
00:40:15.394 --> 00:40:17.566
I'm Maxine Minx.

492
00:40:19.167 --> 00:40:20.635
Yes. you are.

493
00:40:58.001 --> 00:41:00.339
Quite a pathetic scene.
isn't it?

494
00:41:02.874 --> 00:41:05.482
Angry people are so easy
to lead.

495
00:41:06.613 --> 00:41:08.716
Jump in. Let's take a ride.

496
00:41:20.125 --> 00:41:22.495
Fascinating that something
can look so believable

497
00:41:22.597 --> 00:41:24.996
when in reality.
it's all a facade.

498
00:41:34.138 --> 00:41:36.711
The producers don't want you
in this picture.

499
00:41:37.546 --> 00:41:39.377
They say
it's too controversial.

500
00:41:39.479 --> 00:41:40.779
Do you believe that?

501
00:41:40.882 --> 00:41:43.913
Cowards placating
the moral outcry of censors.

502
00:41:44.015 --> 00:41:45.621
worrying their
satanic horror movie

503
00:41:45.723 --> 00:41:48.885
might be too controversial
if it had a porn star in it.

504
00:41:48.987 --> 00:41:50.757
I stuck my neck out
defending you.

505
00:41:50.859 --> 00:41:52.854
We saw hundreds of women
for the role of Veronica.

506
00:41:52.956 --> 00:41:54.057
None of them had what you had.

507
00:41:54.159 --> 00:41:56.425
What you said in the audition.
it was special.

508
00:41:56.528 --> 00:41:58.295
Raw. Real.

509
00:41:58.397 --> 00:41:59.668
Ruthless.

510
00:42:01.237 --> 00:42:02.572
Are you ruthless?

511
00:42:05.273 --> 00:42:06.609
Yes. ma'am.

512
00:42:07.971 --> 00:42:09.579
Well. that makes two of us.

513
00:42:10.278 --> 00:42:11.347
I'm an artist.

514
00:42:11.449 --> 00:42:13.280
This town is prejudiced
against artists.

515
00:42:13.382 --> 00:42:14.615
Scared of its own shadow

516
00:42:14.717 --> 00:42:16.516
when it comes to upsetting
the status quo.

517
00:42:16.618 --> 00:42:18.246
But I say.
if the pearl-clutching

518
00:42:18.348 --> 00:42:20.787
moral majority types
are gonna protest your work.

519
00:42:20.889 --> 00:42:23.120
you might as well make it
bloody mean something.

520
00:42:25.026 --> 00:42:28.296
Your character. Veronica.
is a powder keg ready to blow.

521
00:42:28.398 --> 00:42:30.831
A killer. but not a villain.

522
00:42:30.933 --> 00:42:33.094
She's Clint Eastwood
meets Charlie-fucking-Bronson

523
00:42:33.196 --> 00:42:34.535
and that's what
will set this apart

524
00:42:34.637 --> 00:42:36.337
from all the other sequels
out there.

525
00:42:36.439 --> 00:42:37.637
I want to show that beneath

526
00:42:37.739 --> 00:42:39.640
the technicolor sheen
of the 1950's.

527
00:42:39.743 --> 00:42:42.177
things were just as rotten
as they are today.

528
00:42:42.279 --> 00:42:44.843
A B-movie with A-ideas.

529
00:42:44.945 --> 00:42:47.909
Could be the defining role
of your career.

530
00:42:48.011 --> 00:42:49.385
which is why I need to know

531
00:42:49.487 --> 00:42:51.313
you're willing to do
whatever it takes.

532
00:42:52.616 --> 00:42:54.019
I am.

533
00:42:55.118 --> 00:42:57.594
As if your life
depended on it.

534
00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.255
It does.

535
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.091
Very well.

536
00:43:03.193 --> 00:43:04.663
We'll prove them all
wrong together

537
00:43:04.765 --> 00:43:07.098
in a beautiful
fucking bloodbath.

538
00:43:13.275 --> 00:43:14.237
Here we are.

539
00:43:20.351 --> 00:43:22.383
<i>Do you know what this is?</i>

540
00:43:22.485 --> 00:43:24.654
It's the motel from <i>Psycho.</i>

541
00:43:25.821 --> 00:43:27.420
They filmed a sequel here
a few years back.

542
00:43:27.522 --> 00:43:29.117
if you can believe it.

543
00:43:29.219 --> 00:43:31.759
A serial killer disguised
as an old woman.

544
00:43:31.861 --> 00:43:34.961
America was too prudish
to ever see it coming.

545
00:43:36.795 --> 00:43:38.668
Some things never change.

546
00:43:41.338 --> 00:43:42.998
It's quite the reminder.

547
00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:45.274
People can protest
all they like.

548
00:43:45.376 --> 00:43:46.401
If they'd look in the mirror.

549
00:43:46.503 --> 00:43:49.778
they'd realize we all have
demons staring back at us.

550
00:43:51.978 --> 00:43:54.145
I'd like you
to visit the set tomorrow.

551
00:43:55.815 --> 00:43:57.412
I'm shooting the flashbacks.

552
00:43:58.785 --> 00:43:59.717
Molly Bennett. who plays Clara

553
00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:00.886
in the original.
will be there.

554
00:44:00.988 --> 00:44:02.118
I think it'd be nice for you
to meet her.

555
00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:04.686
She can show you the ropes.
so to speak.

556
00:44:06.024 --> 00:44:07.324
I don't mean
to be disrespectful.

557
00:44:07.426 --> 00:44:10.895
but this isn't a stag film.
It's a major motion picture.

558
00:44:10.997 --> 00:44:12.193
Home video may have
been responsible

559
00:44:12.295 --> 00:44:14.063
for much of
<i>The Puritan</i> 's success.

560
00:44:14.165 --> 00:44:16.264
but we're not some
video nasty anymore.

561
00:44:16.367 --> 00:44:18.036
- We're theatrical now...

562
00:44:18.138 --> 00:44:20.473
and they don't show stag films
on 900 screens.

563
00:44:20.575 --> 00:44:22.107
Are you listening to me?

564
00:44:25.742 --> 00:44:26.947
Yeah.

565
00:44:31.551 --> 00:44:32.755
I'll be there.

566
00:44:34.119 --> 00:44:35.857
Do you want
a bit of free advice?

567
00:44:36.523 --> 00:44:37.527
Look around you.

568
00:44:37.629 --> 00:44:38.692
You've made it
to the belly of the beast.

569
00:44:38.794 --> 00:44:41.829
Congratulations.
Very few come this far.

570
00:44:41.931 --> 00:44:44.059
To stay here. you must
make it your obsession.

571
00:44:44.161 --> 00:44:46.063
Eliminate
all other distractions

572
00:44:46.165 --> 00:44:47.834
because if you take your eye
off that prize

573
00:44:47.936 --> 00:44:50.066
for even a moment.
the beast will spit you

574
00:44:50.168 --> 00:44:52.038
right back out
where you came from.

575
00:44:53.743 --> 00:44:56.108

for you again.

You haven't got
an appointment.

609
00:46:20.291 --> 00:46:23.697
Mr. Night is on
a very important call.

610
00:46:23.799 --> 00:46:25.601
No. I can get you
the bearer bonds.

611
00:46:26.736 --> 00:46:27.732
I just need access
to your junkyard

612
00:46:27.834 --> 00:46:29.636
for a couple of hours.

613
00:46:29.739 --> 00:46:31.938
- That's it.
- We need to talk.

614
00:46:32.041 --> 00:46:34.169
Whoa. whoa. whoa!
What are you doing downtown?

615
00:46:34.271 --> 00:46:35.542
You didn't get shitcanned.
did you?

616
00:46:35.644 --> 00:46:37.446
I am so sorry. Mr. Night.

617
00:46:37.548 --> 00:46:39.315
She just rushed right past me.

618
00:46:39.417 --> 00:46:41.108
You're my lawyer. right?

619
00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:43.644
Entertainment lawyer. yes.

620
00:46:43.746 --> 00:46:47.123
So if I tell you something.
we've got confidentiality?

621
00:46:49.253 --> 00:46:51.289
Frankie. I gotta call you back.

622
00:46:52.429 --> 00:46:54.864
Technically. yes.

623
00:46:55.627 --> 00:46:56.591
Why?

624
00:46:58.302 --> 00:46:59.429
What'd you do?

625
00:47:09.845 --> 00:47:11.810
How long we been
working together?

626
00:47:11.913 --> 00:47:13.175
I discovered you
on the street.

627
00:47:13.277 --> 00:47:15.650
I put you in the movies.
didn't I?

628
00:47:15.752 --> 00:47:17.414
Why didn't you
come to me sooner?

629
00:47:19.116 --> 00:47:22.056
Okay. okay. okay. Relax.

630
00:47:22.657 --> 00:47:23.791
Leave it with me.

631
00:47:23.893 --> 00:47:25.594
You hear from
that detective again.

632
00:47:25.696 --> 00:47:27.190
you tell him
to call your agent.

633
00:47:27.292 --> 00:47:29.365
I'm in charge
of this negotiation now.

634
00:47:29.467 --> 00:47:30.258
I've brokered a lot more

635
00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:32.297
than motion pictures
in my time.

636
00:47:32.962 --> 00:47:34.233
Trust me.

637
00:47:34.335 --> 00:47:36.433
Nobody is more passionate
about your career than I am.

638
00:47:36.535 --> 00:47:39.367
I'll go to jail over it.
that's how passionate I am.

639
00:47:39.469 --> 00:47:41.710
This guy thinks
he's the big bad wolf?

640
00:47:41.812 --> 00:47:45.077
Wrong. I'm the big bad wolf
and nobody

641
00:47:45.179 --> 00:47:46.713
is gonna get in the way
of your big break.

642
00:47:46.815 --> 00:47:48.244
Now. all you gotta worry about

643
00:47:48.346 --> 00:47:50.379
is being undeniable
in that film.

644
00:47:50.481 --> 00:47:54.154
That's most important
right now. <i>capisce?</i>

645
00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:57.927
Stand up tall.

646
00:48:00.562 --> 00:48:01.997
Be strong.

647
00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:06.397
Yeah. you're Maxine Minx.

648
00:48:07.131 --> 00:48:08.932
Go home. Learn your lines.

649
00:48:09.034 --> 00:48:10.468
Keep your mouth shut.

650
00:48:10.937 --> 00:48:12.770
You don't know nothing.

651
00:48:12.872 --> 00:48:14.737
Teddy's got this.

652
00:49:13.768 --> 00:49:15.136
Can I help you?

653
00:49:29.515 --> 00:49:31.581
Look. I ain't in that kind
of business no more.

654
00:49:31.683 --> 00:49:35.717
This is just a video store.
and we're closing soon.

655
00:51:13.188 --> 00:51:15.550
Not a lot of men
in your position

656
00:51:15.652 --> 00:51:18.853
got the stomach
to go all the way.

657
00:51:21.462 --> 00:51:24.595
You certainly are willing
to do the hard yards.

658
00:52:00.064 --> 00:52:01.066
Yeah?

659
00:52:01.168 --> 00:52:02.638
<i>Hold for Teddy Night.</i>

660
00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:04.173

694
00:54:08.662 --> 00:54:11.267
You've heard of

695

Okay. well.

696
00:54:14.404 --> 00:54:16.467
about this satanic shit.
we need to hear about it

697
00:54:16.569 --> 00:54:18.799
because this killer's
still out there.

698
00:54:18.901 --> 00:54:20.340
Look. we don't think
The Night Stalker

699
00:54:20.442 --> 00:54:22.341
committed these crimes.
but whoever did

700
00:54:22.443 --> 00:54:24.343
is setting the bodies up
to look that way.

701
00:54:24.445 --> 00:54:27.443

the common denominator. Why?

702

00:54:28.613 --> 00:54:30.016
who were murdered
in three days.

704
00:54:30.118 --> 00:54:31.551
I'd be pretty scared.

705
00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:35.324
Are you scared. Maxine?

706
00:54:37.227 --> 00:54:40.626
Because if I was scared.
I'd ask for help.

707
00:54:42.726 --> 00:54:45.363
- You can't help me.
- Why not?

708
00:54:45.465 --> 00:54:46.695
Now what are you hiding?

709
00:54:46.797 --> 00:54:47.928
How come you act like
you don't want us

710
00:54:48.031 --> 00:54:49.831
to find out who did this?
It's pissing me off.

711
00:54:49.933 --> 00:54:51.637
You really want us
to take a closer look

712
00:54:51.739 --> 00:54:54.042
at some of the individuals
you're doing business with?

713
00:54:54.144 --> 00:54:55.374
Because actions
have consequences

714
00:54:55.476 --> 00:54:57.077
and you ain't
some barefoot bitch

715
00:54:57.179 --> 00:54:58.543
in a bus station now. right?

716
00:54:58.645 --> 00:55:00.313
Now. I think you got
a lot to lose here.

717
00:55:00.415 --> 00:55:01.742
so you better
watch your fucking step.

718
00:55:01.844 --> 00:55:03.115
All right.
let's pump the brakes.

719
00:55:03.217 --> 00:55:04.185
Maxine. we don't care

720
00:55:04.287 --> 00:55:05.384
what kind of partying
you're into

721
00:55:05.486 --> 00:55:06.781
or what kind of tricks
you're turning.

722
00:55:06.883 --> 00:55:08.954
We're not vice.
We're not narcotics.

723
00:55:09.056 --> 00:55:10.150
We are homicide.

724
00:55:10.252 --> 00:55:13.361
And the only thing that
we care about are these bodies

725
00:55:13.463 --> 00:55:15.830
and making sure we don't find
any more of them.

726
00:55:15.932 --> 00:55:16.692
You Hollywood girls.

727
00:55:16.794 --> 00:55:18.361
you're so desperate
to become famous.

728
00:55:18.463 --> 00:55:19.431
you don't even realize

729
00:55:19.533 --> 00:55:21.532
how easy it is
to become infamous.

730
00:55:21.634 --> 00:55:22.630
-It could be you

731
00:55:22.732 --> 00:55:24.670
on one of these slabs. Maxine.

732
00:55:25.809 --> 00:55:26.903
But it's not.

733
00:55:28.938 --> 00:55:32.612
Can I go?
I'm gonna be late for work.

734
00:55:37.484 --> 00:55:38.717
-What?

735
00:55:39.718 --> 00:55:42.116
You didn't like
that performance either?

736
00:55:44.126 --> 00:55:45.457
Hey! Hold up!

737
00:55:45.559 --> 00:55:46.923
I know you don't think
you can trust me.

738
00:55:47.025 --> 00:55:49.561
but all I want to see is
this sick freak behind bars.

739
00:55:49.663 --> 00:55:51.796
- hand to God.
- What am I supposed to do?

740
00:55:51.898 --> 00:55:54.601
You're supposed to help me
save the next girl's life.

741
00:55:55.202 --> 00:55:56.702
Please. Maxine.

742
00:55:59.241 --> 00:56:01.971
Maybe she should save herself.

743
00:56:03.406 --> 00:56:04.578
I did.

744
00:56:41.248 --> 00:56:42.484
Cut!

745
00:56:49.388 --> 00:56:50.451
The blood's wrong.

746
00:56:50.553 --> 00:56:51.556
Kensington Gore.

747
00:56:51.658 --> 00:56:53.660
It looks like
a bad Hammer picture.

748
00:56:55.729 --> 00:56:58.634
- I need a valium.
- Sorry I'm late. I was...

749
00:56:58.736 --> 00:57:00.129
Don't.

750
00:57:00.231 --> 00:57:03.967
Hearing you blame something
will only irritate me more.

751
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:06.607
The most precious thing
we have in life is our time.

752
00:57:06.709 --> 00:57:09.137
We never have enough.
especially on a production.

753
00:57:10.446 --> 00:57:13.614
If you waste mine again.
you're out.

754
00:57:13.716 --> 00:57:15.614
I'll have the second-best girl
on the Concorde tonight

755
00:57:15.716 --> 00:57:17.183
frothing at the mouth
to take your place.

756
00:57:17.285 --> 00:57:18.916
Is that clear enough?

757
00:57:21.289 --> 00:57:22.722
Right then. Follow me.

758
00:57:27.458 --> 00:57:28.956
Oh.

759
00:57:29.058 --> 00:57:32.598
- How was it. Liz?
- Disappointing. frankly.

760
00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:34.531
Even with all these
extravagant resources.

761
00:57:34.633 --> 00:57:37.099
one thing remains the same.

762
00:57:37.201 --> 00:57:39.640
You want something done right.
you gotta do it yourself.

763
00:57:50.254 --> 00:57:53.384
Molly Bennett.
meet Maxine Minx.

764
00:57:53.486 --> 00:57:55.023
my latest fascination.

765
00:57:55.125 --> 00:57:56.217
Oh. pleased to meet you.

766
00:57:58.194 --> 00:57:59.594
Ah. sorry.

767
00:58:00.991 --> 00:58:03.157
We've all got blood
on our hands now.

768
00:58:03.259 --> 00:58:05.394
Right. let's take it from
after the bite. shall we?

769
00:58:14.508 --> 00:58:17.211
Okay. look. Here's the truth.

770
00:58:17.313 --> 00:58:18.806
Liz is a genius and a mentor.

771
00:58:18.909 --> 00:58:20.576
Just do whatever
she asks of you.

772
00:58:20.678 --> 00:58:21.975
Don't get on her bad side.

773
00:58:22.077 --> 00:58:23.948
and don't overthink
the acting.

774
00:58:24.050 --> 00:58:26.486
Just do what she says
and you'll get loads of jobs.

775
00:58:26.588 --> 00:58:28.516
She's very loyal
to the people she trusts.

776
00:58:28.618 --> 00:58:29.753
Look at me.

777
00:58:29.855 --> 00:58:32.158
I was quite literally
burnt to a crisp

778
00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:33.461
in the last film.

779
00:58:33.563 --> 00:58:36.958
and here I am. resurrected.
A working actor.

780
00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:38.963
Maybe not a household name
just yet.

781
00:58:39.065 --> 00:58:42.468
but at least
my health insurance
won't expire.

782
00:58:42.570 --> 00:58:44.901
Plus.
my charred corpse's scream

783
00:58:45.003 --> 00:58:47.474
has been immortalized
in cinema history.

784
00:58:47.576 --> 00:58:49.409
How many girls
from a council estate

785
00:58:49.511 --> 00:58:51.613
in North Yorkshire
can say that?

786
00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:01.685
Don't worry.

787
00:59:01.787 --> 00:59:03.724
I know what you're
going through.

788
00:59:03.826 --> 00:59:07.156
I was in your shoes once.
I realize how scary it can be.

789
00:59:08.829 --> 00:59:11.631
You've got a memorable face
and a great bod.

790
00:59:11.734 --> 00:59:14.900
You'll take to horror
like a duck to water.

791
00:59:15.867 --> 00:59:17.868
Uh. I've gotta go
get cleaned up.

792
00:59:17.970 --> 00:59:19.636
I was invited
to a big party in the hills

793
00:59:19.738 --> 00:59:21.273
for some out-of-town producer.

794
00:59:21.375 --> 00:59:22.578
See you around.

795
00:59:24.046 --> 00:59:25.042
Yeah.

796
00:59:26.183 --> 00:59:27.880
- Thanks.
- Of course!

797
00:59:27.982 --> 00:59:30.619
Girls gotta look out for
one another in this business.

798
00:59:31.287 --> 00:59:32.984
Nice to meet you. Nadine.

799
01:00:08.258 --> 01:00:11.152
Tsk. tsk. tsk. tsk. tsk.

800
01:00:11.254 --> 01:00:15.322
I told you
not to play chicken. didn't I?

801
01:00:15.424 --> 01:00:18.359
Now let's try and do this
without making a scene.

802
01:00:21.438 --> 01:00:24.640
It's time to pay
for your sins.

803
01:02:21.625 --> 01:02:24.226
-Excuse me.

804
01:02:24.328 --> 01:02:26.058
You can't be up there.

805
01:02:28.562 --> 01:02:30.491
I do apologize.

806
01:02:32.431 --> 01:02:36.068
I guess my morbid curiosity
must've gotten the best of me.

807
01:02:36.170 --> 01:02:39.202
A lot of famous killings
happened inside this house.

808
01:02:39.304 --> 01:02:42.811
- Brutal murders and whatnot.

809
01:02:44.908 --> 01:02:47.143
Can I see your pass?

810
01:02:47.245 --> 01:02:51.413
I don't know
what I did with it.

811
01:02:51.515 --> 01:02:54.721
I am a lost ball
in the high weeds today.

812
01:02:54.823 --> 01:02:56.522
Maybe you can help
straighten me out.

813
01:02:56.624 --> 01:02:57.590
Hey. how about you and me

814
01:02:57.693 --> 01:02:59.119
take a walk on
down to the gate

815
01:02:59.221 --> 01:03:01.156
and we can make this right?

816
01:03:01.258 --> 01:03:03.829
I used to work
in security myself.

817
01:03:03.931 --> 01:03:06.600
- Very important job.

818
01:03:06.702 --> 01:03:08.166
Okay.

819
01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:16.845
What?

820
01:03:19.809 --> 01:03:21.047
Maxine.

821
01:03:23.352 --> 01:03:24.146
I don't like it.

822
01:03:24.248 --> 01:03:26.448
- No. the cream one.
- Okay. Yes. ma'am.

823
01:03:35.492 --> 01:03:37.932
It took me a long time
to get where I am today.

824
01:03:39.064 --> 01:03:40.897
<i>Puritan II</i> isn't
just a sequel.

825
01:03:40.999 --> 01:03:42.197
It's my opportunity to prove

826
01:03:42.299 --> 01:03:44.070
I have a meaningful voice
in this industry

827
01:03:44.172 --> 01:03:46.806
and I can't afford to have
anyone mess that up for me.

828
01:03:46.908 --> 01:03:50.439
I understand.
I'll do whatever you say.

829
01:03:51.274 --> 01:03:53.512
Take the weekend.

830
01:03:53.614 --> 01:03:56.079
Have fun. Let loose.

831
01:03:56.181 --> 01:03:57.378
Because on Monday.
the real work starts

832
01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:59.819
and I'll be expecting
your absolute best.

833
01:03:59.921 --> 01:04:01.621
No more smut!

834
01:04:01.723 --> 01:04:03.484
No more smut! No more smut!

835
01:04:03.586 --> 01:04:06.053
- Okay. man. Okay.
-Keep moving.

836
01:04:06.155 --> 01:04:07.991
Oh. Maxine.

837
01:04:08.093 --> 01:04:09.664
Whatever's going on
in your life

838
01:04:09.766 --> 01:04:11.829
that's interfering
with this picture.

839
01:04:11.931 --> 01:04:14.100
I don't care what it takes.

840
01:04:14.403 --> 01:04:15.970
Squash it.

841
01:04:17.274 --> 01:04:18.599
I intend to.

Do you know why people come to
The Big Easy to work with me?

867
01:06:37.806 --> 01:06:42.215
Because I...
am the best at what I do.

868
01:06:43.513 --> 01:06:46.417
I got a reputation. see?
I can find anyone

869
01:06:46.519 --> 01:06:51.626
anywhere. no matter how badly
they want to stay hidden.

870
01:06:51.728 --> 01:06:53.490
I know how criminals think.

871
01:06:55.158 --> 01:06:57.296
I'm one myself.

872
01:06:59.829 --> 01:07:04.936
Yeah. the only difference
between you and me. Maxine.

873
01:07:05.038 --> 01:07:07.108
is I don't pretend not to be.

874
01:07:11.579 --> 01:07:12.547
Oh. shit.

875
01:07:24.191 --> 01:07:26.660
Time to pay
for your sins.

876
01:07:26.762 --> 01:07:28.162
Lights out. bro.

877
01:07:55.517 --> 01:07:58.126
You do got the devil in you.

878
01:07:59.224 --> 01:08:01.624
I thought you were an atheist?

879
01:08:04.633 --> 01:08:06.596
Fuck you. bitch.

880
01:08:13.269 --> 01:08:14.234
Oh. no. no. Wait.

881
01:08:14.336 --> 01:08:15.875
Wait. wait. wait.

882
01:08:15.978 --> 01:08:18.008
Don't do this.
This ain't fair.

883
01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:19.574
I only work for the man.

884
01:08:19.676 --> 01:08:22.214
Killing me won't stop nothing.
Let's talk!

885
01:08:22.317 --> 01:08:24.950
Come on. you're gonna
need my help. Maxine.

886
01:08:25.053 --> 01:08:27.349
- This isn't over.
- Yes. it is.

887
01:08:27.451 --> 01:08:29.656
Oh. no. no.
This ain't my cause.

888
01:08:29.758 --> 01:08:30.858
I could be bought.

889
01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:33.225
Anything you want!
Anything at all!

890
01:08:33.327 --> 01:08:35.391
Oh. no. no. please!
Please. turn it off!

891
01:08:35.493 --> 01:08:38.232
I don't want to die in here!

892
01:08:38.334 --> 01:08:40.967
Our Father who art in Heaven.
hallowed be thy name.

893
01:08:41.069 --> 01:08:42.297
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done

894
01:08:42.399 --> 01:08:44.102
on earth as it is in heaven.

895
01:08:44.204 --> 01:08:45.905
Give us this day
our daily bread

896
01:08:46.007 --> 01:08:47.074
and forgive us our trespasses

897
01:08:47.177 --> 01:08:49.072
as we forgive
those who trespass against us

898
01:08:49.174 --> 01:08:51.810
and deliver us from evil.

899
01:09:09.625 --> 01:09:12.227
- Get lost.

900
01:09:12.329 --> 01:09:14.061
We'll clean up the mess.

901
01:09:14.163 --> 01:09:15.368
Thanks.

902
01:09:16.431 --> 01:09:18.206
What are agents for?

903
01:10:10.852 --> 01:10:13.354
<i>Tragically.
another female victim</i>

904
01:10:13.456 --> 01:10:14.524

908
01:10:23.436 --> 01:10:26.470
<i>Residents living in fear

909
01:10:26.573 --> 01:10:28.738

911
01:10:35.748 --> 01:10:38.217
- What am I supposed to do?
-You're supposed

912
01:10:38.319 --> 01:10:39.980
to help me save
the next girl's life.

913
01:10:59.901 --> 01:11:02.173
Wanna hit a party
in the hills tonight?

914
01:11:02.275 --> 01:11:05.313
Gonna be loads of rich guys.

915
01:11:06.445 --> 01:11:07.576
I know a killer
after-hours spot

916
01:11:07.678 --> 01:11:09.282
in the hills
if you're interested.

917
01:11:09.384 --> 01:11:11.117
I was invited to a big party
in the hills

918
01:11:11.219 --> 01:11:12.782
with some out-of-town
producer.

919
01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:07.507
We should take her.

920
01:12:09.341 --> 01:12:10.741
Let's give it a beat.

921
01:12:12.741 --> 01:12:14.778
Let's see what she does first.

922
01:14:47.866 --> 01:14:50.230
<i>That's my little girl!</i>

923
01:14:51.307 --> 01:14:54.035
<i>There's nobody else like you.</i>

924
01:14:54.137 --> 01:14:57.506
<i>You're gonna be the star
of the church one day.</i>

925
01:14:57.608 --> 01:14:58.673
<i>Do you think so?</i>

926
01:14:58.775 --> 01:15:00.172
<i>If that's what you want.</i>

927
01:15:00.275 --> 01:15:02.349
<i>I wanna be
just like you. Daddy.</i>

928
01:15:02.451 --> 01:15:04.782
<i>Then you'll have
to work hard.</i>

929
01:15:04.884 --> 01:15:07.522
<i>I will.
I'll do whatever it takes.</i>

930
01:15:08.424 --> 01:15:11.523
<i>Good.
What do we always say?</i>

931
01:15:11.625 --> 01:15:13.423
<i>I will not
accept a life...</i>

932
01:15:13.525 --> 01:15:15.290
<i>Take your time.</i>

933
01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:19.633
<i>Preach it like you mean it
or it won't come true.</i>

934
01:15:20.834 --> 01:15:24.732
<i>I will not accept a life
I do not deserve.</i>

935
01:15:24.834 --> 01:15:28.106
<i>That's right. Maxine.</i>

936
01:15:28.208 --> 01:15:29.872
<i>Very good.</i>

937
01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:40.555
I knew you'd come.

938
01:15:50.697 --> 01:15:54.162
It has taken me years
to find you.

939
01:15:54.830 --> 01:15:56.800
I missed you so much.

940
01:15:56.902 --> 01:16:00.635
You've been lost
for far too long. darling.

941
01:16:00.737 --> 01:16:02.236
Let me take you home.

942
01:16:13.815 --> 01:16:15.590
I'm making a film...

943
01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:19.760
- and you...
-<i>No more smut!</i>

944
01:16:19.862 --> 01:16:23.323
- my beautiful little Maxine...
-<i>No more smut!</i>

945
01:16:27.135 --> 01:16:29.102
are the star!

946
01:16:29.204 --> 01:16:30.600
Well. don't you see?

947
01:16:30.702 --> 01:16:31.965
Hollywood stole you from me

948
01:16:32.067 --> 01:16:34.608
like so many other
poor children.

949
01:16:34.710 --> 01:16:36.542
Satanists have been
propagating sex and violence

950
01:16:36.644 --> 01:16:38.576
throughout our homes
for years now!

951
01:16:38.678 --> 01:16:40.774
Weaponizing
the television set.

952
01:16:40.876 --> 01:16:42.612
brainwashing our youth.

953
01:16:42.714 --> 01:16:45.485
turning them into deviants.

954
01:16:45.587 --> 01:16:47.751
But we'll put a stop
to them together.

955
01:16:47.853 --> 01:16:50.416
I. and many other
grieving parents like me

956
01:16:50.518 --> 01:16:54.725
have come forth to expose
the devil once and for all!

957
01:16:54.827 --> 01:16:57.494
Satan is inside of you.
my darling.

958
01:16:57.596 --> 01:16:59.432
but I can take him out.

959
01:16:59.534 --> 01:17:02.533
It'll be the climax
of the film!

960
01:18:08.264 --> 01:18:09.600
<i>Do you mind
taking your top off</i>

961
01:18:09.702 --> 01:18:11.464
<i>so we can see your breasts?</i>

962
01:18:24.116 --> 01:18:25.951
<i>Y'all should cast me
in this movie.</i>

963
01:18:27.656 --> 01:18:29.015
<i>Oh. really?
Why is that?</i>

964
01:18:31.722 --> 01:18:33.288
Because I'm a star.

965
01:18:34.429 --> 01:18:36.225
Ain't nobody else like me.

966
01:18:37.633 --> 01:18:39.459
The whole world's
gonna know my name.

967
01:19:35.823 --> 01:19:37.818
Don't be frightened.

968
01:19:42.391 --> 01:19:45.431
I'm gonna give you
what you always wanted.

969
01:19:45.533 --> 01:19:46.292
You'll be more famous

970
01:19:46.394 --> 01:19:48.731
than anything Hollywood
could conjure.

971
01:19:48.833 --> 01:19:51.097
Fame that will never end.

972
01:19:51.199 --> 01:19:54.006
I tried to help your friends.

973
01:19:54.908 --> 01:19:58.612
but they wouldn't
accept God's love.

974
01:19:58.714 --> 01:20:01.816
So they were punished
by his wrath.

975
01:20:02.482 --> 01:20:04.383
But not you.

976
01:20:04.485 --> 01:20:05.952
You will be saved.

977
01:20:10.384 --> 01:20:12.420
Are we rolling?

978
01:20:16.165 --> 01:20:17.430
<i>Tonight</i>

979
01:20:17.532 --> 01:20:21.836
<i>I document an exorcism.</i>

980
01:20:21.938 --> 01:20:27.303
<i>a form of miracle
for the whole world to see.</i>

981
01:20:28.541 --> 01:20:32.646
Ezekiel 16:14...

982
01:20:32.748 --> 01:20:34.811
"Your fame went forth

983
01:20:34.913 --> 01:20:37.080

<i>as the cult it is.</i>

990
01:20:57.036 --> 01:21:00.769
Luring children
into lives of sin.

991
01:21:00.871 --> 01:21:02.437
The Devil is real

992
01:21:02.539 --> 01:21:08.547
<i>and he deserves no place
on the screens in our homes.</i>

993
01:21:08.649 --> 01:21:10.944
<i>I have come to save</i>

01:21:11.046 --> 01:21:14.449
<i>all lost children!</i>

995
01:21:24.998 --> 01:21:27.026
Play along with Daddy now.

996
01:21:27.128 --> 01:21:29.068
It's your big scene.

997
01:21:31.735 --> 01:21:35.539

Confess!

1000
01:21:40.813 --> 01:21:43.449
Denounce your life of sin

1001
01:21:43.551 --> 01:21:46.018
and ask to be saved.

1002
01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:51.552
Only then shall you receive
divine intervention.

1003
01:21:52.361 --> 01:21:54.126
For if not...

1004
01:22:00.030 --> 01:22:03.229
<i>you shall be marked</i>

1005
01:22:03.331 --> 01:22:05.669
<i>with the sign of the beast.</i>

1006
01:22:05.771 --> 01:22:07.837
so that the devil

1007
01:22:07.939 --> 01:22:11.638
may never hide amongst us.

1008
01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:14.578
<i>- The choice is yours.</i>

1009
01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:16.680
What do you say?

01:22:18.082 --> 01:22:19.646
Hold it. motherfucker!

1011
01:22:23.718 --> 01:22:27.423
<i>Everybody to the side

<i>I'm not fucking around.</i> Padre!

1013
01:22:38.203 --> 01:22:40.502
Mass has ended!
Put your hands up!

1014
01:22:45.206 --> 01:22:47.113
Do not respect them!

1015
01:22:48.514 --> 01:22:51.880
<i>Where were they when your

They are the devils!

<i>Only the Lord keeps watch

Fight for Him!
Fight for your families!

1021

To the death!

1022
01:23:07.031 --> 01:23:09.366
- Hey!

1023
01:23:49.645 --> 01:23:51.474
Cover me! I gotta reload!

1024
01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:20.970
I'm going up the hill
after the leader!

1025
01:24:21.072 --> 01:24:22.505
- Wait for me!
- Come on.

1026
01:24:31.679 --> 01:24:34.748
Maxine. stay here!
Backup's on the way!

1027
01:24:43.828 --> 01:24:45.165
So am I.

1028
01:25:13.492 --> 01:25:16.092
Freeze! Drop the gun!
Drop it!

1029
01:25:16.195 --> 01:25:17.925
-No!

1030
01:25:28.777 --> 01:25:30.107
Hang in there. Breathe.

1031
01:25:30.209 --> 01:25:31.205
You're okay.
Just hang in there.

1032
01:25:31.307 --> 01:25:32.374
You're gonna make it.

1033
01:25:32.476 --> 01:25:34.577
Maxine! Over here.
Come over here.

1034
01:25:34.679 --> 01:25:37.277
All right. stay with him.
Put pressure on the wound.

1035
01:25:38.646 --> 01:25:39.982
I'm going
to get him.

1036
01:25:47.923 --> 01:25:51.191
30 years in this city.
I never been up here before.

1037
01:25:55.664 --> 01:25:58.238
I wanted to be an actor
once. too.

1038
01:26:30.468 --> 01:26:31.999
- I got him!

1039
01:26:34.370 --> 01:26:35.906
I told you I'd get him!

1040
01:27:05.972 --> 01:27:08.308
It was all for you.

1041
01:27:09.606 --> 01:27:12.411
I tried to give you
what you wanted.

1042
01:27:13.113 --> 01:27:15.546
To be just like your daddy.

1043
01:27:17.017 --> 01:27:20.012
But I created a monster.

1044
01:27:21.052 --> 01:27:22.322
Forgive me.

1045
01:27:23.286 --> 01:27:26.293
Failing a child

1046
01:27:26.395 --> 01:27:29.021
- is the greatest sin of all.

1047
01:27:31.499 --> 01:27:33.029
<i>This is the Los Angeles</i>

A beautiful shining star.

1053

<i>I repeat. drop your weapon.</i>

1054
01:27:52.416 --> 01:27:54.281
<i>This is your last chance.</i>

1055
01:27:54.383 --> 01:27:56.455
<i>It's over. Maxine.</i>

1056
01:27:57.457 --> 01:28:00.090
<i>Step away from the sign.
drop the weapon</i>

1057
01:28:00.192 --> 01:28:01.953
<i>and put your hands up.</i>

1058
01:28:02.056 --> 01:28:03.457
<i>We interrupt this program</i>

1059
01:28:03.559 --> 01:28:05.462
<i>to bring you breaking news.</i>

1060
01:28:05.564 --> 01:28:08.566
The horrifying saga
finally comes to an end.

1061
01:28:08.668 --> 01:28:11.435
<i>The man previously known as
The Night Stalker</i>

1062
01:28:11.537 --> 01:28:14.273
<i>was apprehended by citizens
last night</i>

1063
01:28:14.375 --> 01:28:17.010
<i>bringing an end
to a year-long manhunt</i>

1064
01:28:17.112 --> 01:28:19.244
for the suspected
serial killer.

1065
01:28:19.346 --> 01:28:21.280
More on that later
in our program.

1066
01:28:21.382 --> 01:28:24.613
We are also joined tonight
by Maxine Minx.

1067
01:28:24.715 --> 01:28:27.548
star of the upcoming film.
<i>The Puritan II</i>

1068
01:28:27.650 --> 01:28:30.022
who joins us now
with her attorney

1069
01:28:30.124 --> 01:28:32.192
and our own Dianne Mattingly.

1070
01:28:32.294 --> 01:28:35.490
Maxine. you have become
quite a celebrity

1071
01:28:35.592 --> 01:28:37.230
outside of
the movie business...

1072
01:28:37.333 --> 01:28:40.495
by taking down
a serial murderer of your own.

1073
01:28:40.597 --> 01:28:42.802
who happened to
be your father.

1074
01:28:42.904 --> 01:28:43.831
Isn't that right?

1075
01:28:43.933 --> 01:28:48.000
Why. yes. Dianne.
It was a harrowing experience.

1076
01:28:48.102 --> 01:28:51.509
I'm just so grateful
to be sitting here with you.

1077
01:28:51.611 --> 01:28:54.645
I've gotta thank God
for orchestrating this all.

1078
01:28:57.517 --> 01:29:01.514
<i>Maxine! Maxine! Maxine!</i>

1079
01:29:01.616 --> 01:29:06.156
<i>Maxine! Maxine! Maxine!</i>

1080
01:29:06.258 --> 01:29:10.958
<i>Maxine! Maxine! Maxine!</i>

1081
01:29:30.985 --> 01:29:32.450
Maxine. over here!

1082
01:29:32.552 --> 01:29:35.852
- Maxine. you look incredible.
- Thank you.

1083
01:29:35.954 --> 01:29:38.754
How does it feel knowing that
after all you've been through.

1084
01:29:38.856 --> 01:29:41.621
you're in one of the biggest
movies in America?

1085
01:29:41.723 --> 01:29:44.694
It's hard to put into words.

1086
01:29:44.796 --> 01:29:47.429
There are reports
that you sold your life rights

1087
01:29:47.531 --> 01:29:49.367
and that the Maxine Minx story

1088
01:29:49.469 --> 01:29:50.664
will be going
into production soon

1089
01:29:50.766 --> 01:29:53.372
with Elizabeth Bender
directing.

1090
01:29:53.475 --> 01:29:55.305
Is there anything you want
to tell the people

1091
01:29:55.407 --> 01:29:56.474
at home watching you tonight?

1092
01:29:56.576 --> 01:29:58.871
Any words of encouragement
for young girls

1093
01:29:58.973 --> 01:30:01.745
trying to make it big
in Hollywood?

1094
01:30:03.412 --> 01:30:04.946
Never give up.

1095
01:30:07.021 --> 01:30:09.081
It's hard work.

1096
01:30:09.183 --> 01:30:12.190
You've gotta be willing to do
whatever it takes.

1097
01:30:20.368 --> 01:30:24.234
There's a phrase
my daddy always used.

1098
01:30:36.281 --> 01:30:38.617
Say it with me now.

1099
01:30:41.622 --> 01:30:44.820
- I will not accept...
- I will not accept...

1100
01:30:44.922 --> 01:30:49.529
- a life I do not deserve.
- a life I do not deserve.

1101
01:30:53.332 --> 01:30:55.568
You didn't fail me. Daddy.

1102
01:30:58.768 --> 01:31:01.541
You gave me
just what I needed.

1103
01:31:10.447 --> 01:31:13.179
Divine intervention.

Miss Minx.

Okay. thanks.

1115
01:32:38.273 --> 01:32:40.970
You're a fucking movie star.

1116
01:32:47.246 --> 01:32:48.274
Thank you.

1117

Thank you.

1118
01:32:58.459 --> 01:32:59.592
Right.
before we begin.

1119
01:32:59.694 --> 01:33:02.629
let's take a moment
to remember Molly Bennett.

1120
01:33:02.731 --> 01:33:05.594
She was the original member
of our <i>Puritan</i> family

1121
01:33:05.696 --> 01:33:07.667
and she'll be dearly missed.

1122
01:33:31.524 --> 01:33:33.155
All right. thank you everyone.

1123
01:33:33.557 --> 01:33:35.090
It's back to work.

1124
01:33:46.770 --> 01:33:48.840
Just like a Hitchcock blonde.

1125
01:33:52.140 --> 01:33:54.076
How does it feel
being someone else?

1126
01:33:55.412 --> 01:33:56.375
Good.

1127
01:34:04.688 --> 01:34:06.319
Quite the turn of events.

1128
01:34:08.460 --> 01:34:09.894
Tragic. really.

1129
01:34:11.998 --> 01:34:14.800
Molly was never gonna make it
beyond the franchise.

1130
01:34:15.966 --> 01:34:18.735
She was good.
but she wasn't a star.

1131
01:34:18.837 --> 01:34:19.832
Right. we've got
one more setup left

1132
01:34:19.934 --> 01:34:21.206
of the dream sequence.

1133
01:34:21.308 --> 01:34:22.676
Come see your head.

1134
01:34:27.842 --> 01:34:29.111
It looks so real.

1135
01:34:29.213 --> 01:34:31.146
All right.
we're ready
to give this a try.

1136
01:34:31.614 --> 01:34:32.785
Brilliant.

1137
01:34:33.650 --> 01:34:34.919
Let's lock it up!

1138
01:34:35.519 --> 01:34:36.690
Roll camera!

1139
01:34:41.629 --> 01:34:43.730
So now that everyone
knows your name.

1140
01:34:45.061 --> 01:34:46.664
any idea what you want
to do next?

1141
01:34:46.766 --> 01:34:49.032
You've certainly
got everyone's attention.

1142
01:34:54.442 --> 01:34:56.402
