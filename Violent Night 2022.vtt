00:00:25.901 --> 00:00:28.195
-Action.
-Design.

4
00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:10.320
- Another one?

5
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.324
Well. I'm still vertical.
so I'd like to change that.

6
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:25.585
Ho. ho.

7
00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:29.339
Bitter. Pint.

8
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.134
You just get off?

9
00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:39.141
I'm taking a break.

10
00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:41.310
Between shifts.
I guess you could say.

11
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.894
- Hmm.
- You ain't driving. are you?

12
00:01:42.894 --> 00:01:45.939
I steer a little. but the
reindeer do most of the work.

13
00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:50.277
Mm-hmm.

14
00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:52.487
This is my. uh.
fourth year as a Santa.

15
00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:53.780
Ah.

16
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.032
How about you?

17
00:01:55.032 --> 00:01:57.117
Lost count.

18
00:01:57.117 --> 00:02:00.287
I forget why I started doing it
in the first place.

19
00:02:00.287 --> 00:02:03.582
Same reason anybody
does anything.

20
00:02:03.582 --> 00:02:05.375
The money.

21
00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:08.045
Money. Money.

22
00:02:08.045 --> 00:02:10.047
This whole planet runs on greed.

23
00:02:14.718 --> 00:02:17.179
It's the look on
the kiddies' faces. innit?

24
00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:18.805
That's what does it for me.

25
00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:22.476
- Ah. the look. Yeah. that look.

26
00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:24.686
Lasts about two seconds.

27
00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:27.105
As soon as they're finished
unwrapping.

28
00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:29.566
they want the next present.

29
00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:32.319
they want the next cool thing.

30
00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.321
That's how this world works.

31
00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:36.365
And kids--
what kids have become.

32
00:02:36.365 --> 00:02:40.535
They're just like
little junkies.

33
00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:43.205
They're little shits.
They just demand.

34
00:02:43.205 --> 00:02:44.748
They don't believe.

35
00:02:44.748 --> 00:02:48.460
They just want. crave. consume.

36
00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:55.967
Maybe this is my last year.

37
00:02:58.053 --> 00:03:00.222
The last Christmas.

38
00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:07.312
Well. I can't stand seeing
another Santa in distress.

39
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.107
Put his drinks on my tab.

40
00:03:10.107 --> 00:03:11.566
- Okay?
- Yeah.

41
00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:14.194
Oh. very merry of you. Okay.

42
00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:16.613
I better get going.

43
00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:18.824
Presents aren't gonna
deliver themselves.

44
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:21.868
Oh. uh...

45
00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:23.745
For your grandson.
Save me a trip.

46
00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:25.789
It's. uh. that new video game.

47
00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:28.500
It's Astro Blaster.
Blaster Astro.

48
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.502
I-I don't know.

49
00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:31.878
Merry Christmas.

50
00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:34.381
How'd he know
my grandson's name?

51
00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:37.592
- How'd he know I have
a grandson? -

52
00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:41.888
Oi! That door leads to the roof.

53
00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:43.223
Piss head.

54
00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:45.767
Go easy on him. It's Christmas.

55
00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:51.314
Hey! You can't be up here.

56
00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:54.985
If you break your neck.
I'm the one...

57
00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:17.257
My God.

58
00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:24.097
It's...

59
00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:27.601
...beauti...

60
00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:16.650
Hi. Hi. hi. hi.

61
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.985
There she is. Hello. muffin.

62
00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:22.322
Let's go see Grandma.

63
00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:25.492
Ooh.

64
00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:27.744
Merry Christmas.

65
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.665
Merry Christmas. Trudy.

66
00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:32.749
Merry...

67
00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:34.501
Mwah. mwah. mwah. mwah. mwah!

68
00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:37.921
Merry Christmas. Daddy.
ya filthy animal.

69
00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:41.508
She got to stay up late
and watch Home Alone.

70
00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:42.592
Uh-huh.

71
00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:45.512
It was so funny.

72
00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:47.973
- Yep.
- That... that hurts.

73
00:05:47.973 --> 00:05:49.516
- All morning.
- Okay. um...

74
00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:51.560
Thank you.

75
00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:54.479
For doing this.

76
00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.690
I'm not doing it for you.

77
00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.485
- It's Christmas!
- Yeah!

78
00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:21.381
Merry Christmas. Al.

79
00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.216
Hi. Linda. Merry Christmas.

80
00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:25.260
- Mr. Lightstone.
- Hey. Al.

81
00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.636
Hey. you back there. Tru?

82
00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:28.388
Yeah. I bet you're excited
for Christmas.

83
00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:30.098
What did you ask Santa for?

84
00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:31.850
- Not to work on Christmas Eve.

85
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.435
Must've been naughty this year.

86
00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:35.061
-'cause here I am.
- Mm-hmm.

87
00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:37.063
Just make sure you let Santa
through the gates later. Al.

88
00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:38.607
- Yeah.
- Have a merry one. now.

89
00:06:38.607 --> 00:06:40.609
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas. Al.

90
00:06:40.609 --> 00:06:42.652
Merry Christmas. Tru.

91
00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:44.195
-Thank you. Al.
- Yeah.

92
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.763
I can't remember
where the second one is.

93
00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:14.934
Ho. ho. ho. ho.

94
00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:16.686
Merry Christmas.

95
00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:18.772
Hope you're on the nice list.

96
00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:21.524
That doesn't go over there.

97
00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:30.909
Excuse me.

98
00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:36.956
What the hell is this?

99
00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:39.334
You are the worst
catering company on the planet.

100
00:07:39.334 --> 00:07:41.336
It's lengthwise. not width.

101
00:07:41.336 --> 00:07:43.213
Unbelievable.

102
00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:00.814
Okay.

103
00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:03.024
Hi. Hi. guys. Merry Christmas.

104
00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:04.984
- Hi.
- I'm fine. Thank you so much.

105
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:11.574
I'll never get over the fact
that you grew up like this.

106
00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:15.161
My therapist says
I'll never get over it. either.

107
00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:17.372
I need a drink.

108
00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:25.171
- Hey. look at that.

109
00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:35.932
Hi. Linda.

110
00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:37.976
- Hey.
- How's it going. Alva?

111
00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:39.894
Mm-hmm. You gained weight.

112
00:08:39.894 --> 00:08:42.772
- Looks good on you. though.

113
00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:44.691
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

114
00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:46.401
'Sup. limp dick?

115
00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:49.529
I got great feelings
about this Christmas.

116
00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:51.698
- You want to know why?
- Yeah.

117
00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:53.700
'Cause I think this is the year

118
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.493
that Mom's gonna
kick herself upstairs

119
00:08:55.493 --> 00:08:58.204
and choose one of us
to start running the show.

120
00:08:58.204 --> 00:09:02.709
And I got to tell you. Jason.
that I'm gunning for your ass.

121
00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:05.920
What would a Lightstone
family Christmas be

122
00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.714
without groveling
and infighting?

123
00:09:09.048 --> 00:09:10.759
Your rosÃ©. ma'am.

124
00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:13.511
Honey. smile. It's Christmas.

125
00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:14.637
Mm.

126
00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:16.222
Good. Good girl.

127
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.728
I am sorry about my sister.

128
00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:29.569
It is really nice to see you.

129
00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:33.698
To have you here.

130
00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:40.413
Okay. I'm behind. Catch me up
on all the hot goss.

131
00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.248
Hot goss. Okay.

132
00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:46.044
Um. well. you remember Bert.
my sister's pride and joy.

133
00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:49.881
Yo. yo. yo.
This is the Bert Locker

134
00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:53.760
living that bling life
on Christmas Eve.

135
00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:56.763
Hashtag "blessed."

136
00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:59.307
He just got
what I can only assume

137
00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:02.602
will be his first of many
sexual harassment accusations.

138
00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:04.270
Mom paid off the school.

139
00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.439
and now the gymnasium
is named after us.

140
00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:08.441
Of course she did.

141
00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:09.567
What about Tragic Mike?

142
00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:11.361
All I'm saying is.

143
00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:13.029
if I was on one of those planes.

144
00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:15.031
9/11 would've ended
with a bunch of terrorists

145
00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:18.785
skydiving over Connecticut
without their parachutes.

146
00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:20.829
-Yeah. You like that?
- Yes. Yes.

147
00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:23.039
- Yeah. I do like it.
- Ooh.

148
00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:25.458
- Kiss me in front of my son.
- Now. huh?

149
00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:28.002
- Mm...

150
00:10:28.002 --> 00:10:30.046
He might actually be
a decent actor.

151
00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:32.131
- Hmm. -He's been doing
an Oscar-worthy job

152
00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:34.717
- of pretending to find
my sister appealing. -

153
00:10:34.717 --> 00:10:37.220
Now he wants Mom
to fund a film for him.

154
00:10:40.139 --> 00:10:42.141
- It's Gertrude!
- It's Mom.

155
00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:44.185
- Okay. let's do this.
- Okay. okay. Come on.

156
00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:45.895
- Come on. Bert. get over here.
- No. Mom. Mom!

157
00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:47.146
- Positions.
- Game time. buddy.

158
00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:48.982
- Okay. Okay.
- This is my good side.

159
00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:50.775
We've gone over this! Come on!

160
00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:51.901
Gosh. Okay.

161
00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:53.069
Bert. get in the middle.

162
00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:54.320
So it begins.

163
00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.447
Seriously. come.
You know what that means.

164
00:10:56.447 --> 00:10:58.533
Shall we jockey forward?

165
00:10:58.533 --> 00:11:00.285
No.

166
00:11:01.452 --> 00:11:04.038
No. we can hang back.

167
00:11:04.038 --> 00:11:05.498
Yeah.

168
00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:07.125
Trudy. honey?

169
00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:10.086
Come on over here.

170
00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:13.715
Just. like...

171
00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:15.508
Threaten 'em or bribe 'em.

172
00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:16.801
This isn't rocket science.

173
00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:18.344
Same shit we always do.

174
00:11:19.846 --> 00:11:21.180
That's what?

175
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.641
That's the best you can do?

176
00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:25.518
Excited to see your grandma?

177
00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:26.853
Listen. you cocksucker.

178
00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:28.813
It's Christmas.
so why don't you take

179
00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:30.732
your best offer. gift wrap it.

180
00:11:30.732 --> 00:11:33.693
and ram it up your fucking box.

181
00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:37.363
Maybe you don't
realize who I am.

182
00:11:37.363 --> 00:11:38.948
Those were Grandma words.
You know. forget them.

183
00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:40.783
Oh. boy.
Look at Mr. Cool back here.

184
00:11:40.783 --> 00:11:43.036
Yeah. what's your angle. man?
Hmm?

185
00:11:43.036 --> 00:11:45.663
No angle.
I'm not doing anything.

186
00:11:45.663 --> 00:11:47.123
Oh. yeah.

187
00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:48.708
No. no. no.
No. no. no. no. no. No!

188
00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:51.753
Don't shit in my mouth
and tell me it's chocolate cake.

189
00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:53.046
Grandma's cool.

190
00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:55.340
I can make that story go away...

191
00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.050
I think your brother's
up to something.

192
00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:58.843
No. I just decided
to let you guys

193
00:11:58.843 --> 00:12:00.720
have all the fun
sucking up to Mom today.

194
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.514
Please. You are King Suck-up.

195
00:12:03.514 --> 00:12:05.558
You named your kid Gertrude.

196
00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:09.228
Alva. you named
your son Bertrude.

197
00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:11.230
Okay.

198
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.941
Sorry. Bert.
but that's not a real name.

199
00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:15.777
Sorry. Linda. We can't all be
lucky enough to have daughters.

200
00:12:15.777 --> 00:12:17.779
Mom. I can hear you.

201
00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:21.491
You know something we don't.
What is it?

202
00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:22.951
No. I don't. I don't.

203
00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:24.202
I got it. Bingo.

204
00:12:24.202 --> 00:12:25.620
I'm onto you. man. Come on!

205
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.246
- We were just...
- Come on.

206
00:12:27.246 --> 00:12:28.498
come on. come on. come on.

207
00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:30.792
- You big sack of shit.
- Ooh.

208
00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:32.627
No wonder your husband left you.

209
00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:34.879
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

210
00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:38.257
Merry Christmas to you. too.
Senator.

211
00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:40.885
- Merry Christmas. Mommy.
- Merry Christmas.

212
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.763
Merry Christmas.

213
00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:46.516
Why in the hell are you standing
all the way back there?

214
00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.352
Merry Christmas. Grandma!

215
00:12:49.352 --> 00:12:51.437
- Aw.
- Little bitch.

216
00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:53.982
Little Gertrude. And how is
my favorite granddaughter?

217
00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:56.526
Everybody calls me Trudy now.

218
00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:58.194
Trudy?

219
00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:01.656
- Well. that makes her
sound like a whore. -Okay.

220
00:13:01.656 --> 00:13:04.409
Oh. she doesn't even know
the meaning of the word.

221
00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:06.744
I'm starving. Let's eat.

222
00:13:06.744 --> 00:13:08.204
Great.

223
00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:10.707
And. Mom. I think Gertrude
is a beautiful name.

224
00:13:10.707 --> 00:13:13.001
Mm-hmm.
I only call her Gertrude.

225
00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:14.293
- Merry Christmas. Gertrude.
- Come on. Bertrude.

226
00:14:19.192 --> 00:14:22.028
Another fucking Christmas.

227
00:14:25.364 --> 00:14:27.116
I made these all by myself.

228
00:14:27.116 --> 00:14:28.701
- No way.
- Mm-hmm.

229
00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:30.870
I even made one
that looks exactly like Santa.

230
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.372
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

231
00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:35.750
Santa gets a candy cane. too?

232
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.001
Yeah.

233
00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:38.503
Mm. okay.

234
00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:41.547
It's perfect.

235
00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:43.216
No peeking.

236
00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:45.676
This house has so many chimneys.

237
00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:49.222
How will Santa know
which one to come down?

238
00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:51.099
Oh. Santa just knows.

239
00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:52.892
Christmas magic.

240
00:14:55.853 --> 00:14:57.563
Honey. what's wrong?

241
00:14:57.563 --> 00:15:01.067
Daddy never took me to see
Santa at the mall this year.

242
00:15:01.859 --> 00:15:04.070
He didn't.

243
00:15:06.447 --> 00:15:08.449
I am so sorry.

244
00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:12.203
This year has been weird.

245
00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:15.915
I never got to tell Santa
what I wanted for Christmas.

246
00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:18.417
Oh. honey. Come here.

247
00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:24.715
You know what?

248
00:15:24.715 --> 00:15:28.928
You go put your pj's on.

249
00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:32.014
and I will be two minutes.

250
00:15:37.812 --> 00:15:40.106
Yes!

251
00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:43.985
Okay...

252
00:15:51.909 --> 00:15:53.619
Yes.

253
00:15:57.456 --> 00:15:59.292
Yes!

254
00:16:00.751 --> 00:16:05.173
Because you have been so good
to me and Mommy this year.

255
00:16:05.173 --> 00:16:09.135
we decided that
you could have one gift...

256
00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:11.012
early!

257
00:16:11.012 --> 00:16:13.472
- Really?

258
00:16:17.518 --> 00:16:19.604
What is it?

259
00:16:21.522 --> 00:16:25.109
That is a very special
walkie-talkie.

260
00:16:25.109 --> 00:16:26.652
It's magic.

261
00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:27.945
- Magic?
- Mm-hmm.

262
00:16:27.945 --> 00:16:30.156
What you got right there

263
00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:32.533
is a direct hotline
to Santa Claus himself.

264
00:16:32.533 --> 00:16:35.286
- I can talk to Santa?
- Oh. yeah.

265
00:16:35.286 --> 00:16:39.123
It's just like writing him
a letter... but better.

266
00:16:39.123 --> 00:16:40.249
Mm-hmm.

267
00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:43.044
Now. the only thing is.

268
00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:45.421
he might not have time
to answer you.

269
00:16:45.421 --> 00:16:47.465
He's delivering a lot
of presents tonight.

270
00:16:47.465 --> 00:16:48.799
Mm-hmm.

271
00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:51.385
But he'll hear everything
you want to say to him.

272
00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:59.685
Hello. Santa?

273
00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:03.147
This is Trudy Lightstone.

274
00:17:03.147 --> 00:17:05.191
I hope you're having
a nice night.

275
00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:07.360
Mm.

276
00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:12.114
It's really cold tonight.
so don't forget your mittens.

277
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:16.244
So. I wanted to tell you. Santa.

278
00:17:16.244 --> 00:17:18.037
I was extra good this year.

279
00:17:18.037 --> 00:17:22.208
so I wrote a big list for you
with all the stuff I wanted.

280
00:17:23.542 --> 00:17:25.419
But then...

281
00:17:25.419 --> 00:17:28.839
then I realized
I don't need any of that.

282
00:17:29.757 --> 00:17:33.469
I really only want
one present for Christmas.

283
00:17:35.137 --> 00:17:38.808
I want Mommy and Daddy
to make up

284
00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:41.227
so we can be a family again.

285
00:17:42.436 --> 00:17:44.105
Okay.

286
00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:46.274
Good night. Santa.

287
00:17:47.441 --> 00:17:49.568
Good night. Mr. Bunny.

288
00:18:01.998 --> 00:18:03.749
Which one of you did that?

289
00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:06.419
You can't go two seconds without

290
00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:08.254
crapping on the roof
like a bunch of pigeons?

291
00:18:09.964 --> 00:18:13.092
So unprofessional.

292
00:18:15.678 --> 00:18:18.389
You know. Rudolph
will never do this crap.

293
00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:33.279
Hmm.

294
00:18:37.575 --> 00:18:39.368
Mmm.

295
00:18:46.042 --> 00:18:48.294
Mmm. mmm.

296
00:18:49.295 --> 00:18:51.630
Homemade.

297
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.007
Mmm.

298
00:18:56.844 --> 00:18:58.846
Ugh.

299
00:18:58.846 --> 00:19:00.431
Skim.

300
00:19:10.691 --> 00:19:12.276
Oh. yeah.

301
00:19:12.276 --> 00:19:14.403
That's the stuff.

302
00:19:18.824 --> 00:19:20.743
Mmm.

303
00:19:21.744 --> 00:19:23.496
DuBoi...

304
00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:26.499
- On some prewar shit
right there. -

305
00:19:26.499 --> 00:19:28.918
- Good shit.

306
00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:42.181
Mmm.

307
00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:43.849
That pairs well.

308
00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:46.519
What do we have here?

309
00:20:02.743 --> 00:20:04.453
Oh. yeah.

310
00:20:04.453 --> 00:20:06.539
That's the stuff.

311
00:20:15.464 --> 00:20:18.551
- You know. uh...

312
00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:21.554
Christmas is all right.

313
00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:25.224
but you Americans don't
celebrate my favorite holiday.

314
00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:27.893
Oh. yeah? What?

315
00:20:27.893 --> 00:20:29.520
Boxing Day.

316
00:21:02.761 --> 00:21:04.430
Yo. yo. B. Lightstone here.

317
00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:06.223
live streaming the dream.
you know.

318
00:21:06.223 --> 00:21:08.767
They say the richest man...

319
00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:11.562
Say goodbye.

320
00:21:11.562 --> 00:21:13.522
And if you...

321
00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:17.693
Grandma! Your Wi-Fi sucks dick.

322
00:21:17.693 --> 00:21:19.361
Damn it!

323
00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:21.947
When he was small.
I begged you to beat him.

324
00:21:39.423 --> 00:21:41.425
Hey. Merry Christmas.

325
00:21:41.425 --> 00:21:43.093
Or should I say
"happy holidays" now?

326
00:21:43.093 --> 00:21:45.137
Right? I mean. it's like.
people. make up your minds.

327
00:21:45.137 --> 00:21:47.389
- You know what I'm saying?
- Can I help you?

328
00:21:47.389 --> 00:21:49.350
Oh. yeah. I sure hope so.
See. uh.

329
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:50.976
my car broke down
a little ways...

330
00:21:50.976 --> 00:21:52.811
Out here?
This is a private road.

331
00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:54.813
You're telling me.

332
00:21:54.813 --> 00:21:57.107
It's the first place
I've seen for miles.

333
00:21:57.107 --> 00:21:58.400
I think I got frostbite.

334
00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.735
Where the hell am I. anyway?

335
00:21:59.735 --> 00:22:01.487
G.T. Lightstone family compound.

336
00:22:01.487 --> 00:22:03.322
I'll call you a tow.

337
00:22:12.373 --> 00:22:14.375
All right. revelers.

338
00:22:14.375 --> 00:22:16.168
Time to steal Christmas.

339
00:22:16.168 --> 00:22:17.419
Sound off.

340
00:22:17.419 --> 00:22:19.004
Jingle. Check.

341
00:22:19.004 --> 00:22:20.589
Peppermint. Check.

342
00:22:20.589 --> 00:22:22.174
Sugarplum. Check.

343
00:22:22.174 --> 00:22:25.135
Krampus. Ready to fuck shit up.

344
00:22:25.135 --> 00:22:26.929
Candy Cane. Check.

345
00:22:26.929 --> 00:22:29.557
- Go for Frosty.
- Go for Tinsel.

346
00:22:29.557 --> 00:22:31.267
Go for Gingerbread.

347
00:22:31.267 --> 00:22:34.228
Are we gonna use these stupid
code names all night?

348
00:22:34.228 --> 00:22:35.729
'Tis the season.

349
00:22:35.729 --> 00:22:39.525
Welcome to your worst
Christmas ever.

350
00:22:39.525 --> 00:22:42.903
Trudy loves seeing Santa
at the mall.

351
00:22:43.737 --> 00:22:45.531
She loves going with her father.

352
00:22:45.531 --> 00:22:47.199
And you should've
taken her yesterday.

353
00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:48.576
like you do every Christmas.

354
00:22:48.576 --> 00:22:50.286
but we didn't even
hear from you.

355
00:22:50.286 --> 00:22:51.620
Mom put me on a special project.

356
00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.038
- It's complicated.
- But it's not.

357
00:22:53.038 --> 00:22:55.124
because it keeps happening
over and over.

358
00:22:55.124 --> 00:22:57.710
- Your mother forcing herself
between us. -You're right.

359
00:23:02.298 --> 00:23:04.675
What if we could give Trudy
her Christmas wish?

360
00:23:04.675 --> 00:23:06.760
You're trying to win me back

361
00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.430
with a romantic weekend
at your mother's?

362
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:12.766
What if things
really changed this time?

363
00:23:14.518 --> 00:23:16.979
We got out from under
my mother's thumb.

364
00:23:16.979 --> 00:23:18.772
We'll walk away.

365
00:23:18.772 --> 00:23:21.483
From the company. the family.

366
00:23:24.194 --> 00:23:25.821
Tonight.

367
00:23:26.614 --> 00:23:28.157
What are you up to?

368
00:24:13.452 --> 00:24:14.745
Let's go.

369
00:24:14.745 --> 00:24:17.247
We need to get you out of here.

370
00:24:17.247 --> 00:24:18.999
Mommy. where are you going?

371
00:24:18.999 --> 00:24:20.793
- She's going for the panic room!
- What?

372
00:24:20.793 --> 00:24:22.127
- Yes. Go. Bertrude.
- Without us?

373
00:24:28.092 --> 00:24:30.135
Fuck. fuck. fuck.
fuck. fuck. fuck.

374
00:24:51.824 --> 00:24:53.784
There isn't room for all of us.

375
00:24:53.784 --> 00:24:55.536
She can fit at least two of us.
Mom. take me.

376
00:24:55.536 --> 00:24:57.496
- Mom!
- Oh. Yeah.

377
00:24:57.496 --> 00:24:59.123
M-Mom. can Bert come. too?

378
00:25:01.792 --> 00:25:03.043
Okay. Move it or lose it. son.

379
00:25:03.043 --> 00:25:04.753
- Move it!
- Whoa. whoa. whoa.

380
00:25:04.753 --> 00:25:06.880
You're supposed to protect us.

381
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.549
We protect the primary asset.

382
00:25:12.511 --> 00:25:13.721
Who the hell are you?

383
00:25:13.721 --> 00:25:16.682
You can call me Mr. Scrooge.

384
00:25:17.433 --> 00:25:18.851
Hilarious.

385
00:25:18.851 --> 00:25:20.185
Get him.

386
00:25:28.736 --> 00:25:31.155
Bah humbug. motherfucker.

387
00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:42.791
Hey. Step aside.

388
00:25:44.042 --> 00:25:46.545
Tinsel. Peppermint.
sweep upstairs.

389
00:25:46.545 --> 00:25:48.756
I want all the Lightstones
together.

390
00:25:49.548 --> 00:25:51.258
Kill anybody else you find.

391
00:26:01.435 --> 00:26:04.229
Fuck. Fuck. fuck.

392
00:26:05.063 --> 00:26:07.608
Trudy. honey. we got to go.

393
00:26:08.567 --> 00:26:10.110
Wake up. honey. Wake up.

394
00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:12.905
Maybe we can get out the back
by the servants' stairs.

395
00:26:19.745 --> 00:26:22.247
Oh. come on. Not now. Not now.

396
00:26:23.373 --> 00:26:25.375
Fuck! Fuck!

397
00:26:25.375 --> 00:26:26.919
Mistletoe. gingerbread.

398
00:26:51.109 --> 00:26:52.194
Hey!

399
00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:56.281
Oh. Oh.

400
00:26:56.281 --> 00:26:57.741
Hi.

401
00:26:57.741 --> 00:27:00.202
You got me.

402
00:27:00.202 --> 00:27:02.788
I don't want any trouble. okay?

403
00:27:02.788 --> 00:27:04.498
Downstairs. Now.

404
00:27:04.498 --> 00:27:08.168
Look. mister.
I don't want to get involved.

405
00:27:08.168 --> 00:27:10.587
I just...
I just have a job to do.

406
00:27:10.587 --> 00:27:11.964
Okay? That's it.

407
00:27:11.964 --> 00:27:14.466
I'm just gonna take my bag.

408
00:27:14.466 --> 00:27:17.302
and I'm just gonna
scooch up that chimney.

409
00:27:18.804 --> 00:27:20.681
Enough talk. Let's go.

410
00:27:21.473 --> 00:27:23.225
You don't want to do this.

411
00:27:23.225 --> 00:27:24.434
What? This?

412
00:27:26.144 --> 00:27:27.479
Now. move!

413
00:27:27.479 --> 00:27:29.481
- Are you deaf?

414
00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:31.483
Fucking move!

415
00:27:42.286 --> 00:27:44.162
No. no. no.

416
00:27:44.162 --> 00:27:47.332
No! Wait!

417
00:27:47.332 --> 00:27:48.667
Wait.

418
00:27:48.667 --> 00:27:50.335
Wait! Don't go!

419
00:27:50.335 --> 00:27:52.212
Come back!

420
00:29:07.287 --> 00:29:09.039
Oh. fuck!

421
00:29:33.146 --> 00:29:34.648
Oh. shit.

422
00:29:55.961 --> 00:29:59.798
Damn chickenshit reindeer
leave me here to die.

423
00:30:21.778 --> 00:30:23.155
Cute.

424
00:30:23.155 --> 00:30:26.283
Do you have any idea
who you're fucking with?

425
00:30:29.619 --> 00:30:32.497
I know exactly
who I'm fucking with.

426
00:30:32.497 --> 00:30:34.624
Oh. wait. wait.
Did you actually think

427
00:30:34.624 --> 00:30:36.168
that I spent months

428
00:30:36.168 --> 00:30:38.837
planning a complex break-in
to the most secure

429
00:30:38.837 --> 00:30:40.464
private residence in the country

430
00:30:40.464 --> 00:30:42.215
and I didn't know
who lived here?

431
00:30:42.215 --> 00:30:43.800
Well. you're wrong.

432
00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.762
'Cause your staff are dead.

433
00:30:46.762 --> 00:30:48.889
- Your security are dead.

434
00:30:48.889 --> 00:30:52.184
Now. sit down
and shut the fuck up!

435
00:31:20.295 --> 00:31:22.339
Oh. fuck.

436
00:31:25.217 --> 00:31:26.551
We planned it. It's all right.

437
00:31:26.551 --> 00:31:28.178
It'll be solved
in a couple minutes.

438
00:31:28.178 --> 00:31:29.721
Better be solved.

439
00:31:29.721 --> 00:31:32.099
So much like a scene
from my movie Dark Ransom.

440
00:31:32.099 --> 00:31:33.558
Oh. my God.

441
00:31:34.726 --> 00:31:36.228
If they didn't have guns.

442
00:31:36.228 --> 00:31:38.271
I could take out three.
maybe four of them.

443
00:31:38.271 --> 00:31:40.398
Try all of them.

444
00:31:40.398 --> 00:31:43.026
Ew. Mom. Yuck.

445
00:31:43.026 --> 00:31:44.820
If you'd really done
your research. you'd know

446
00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:47.614
that my brother Rory
was kidnapped in the '70s.

447
00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:51.118
But my father
never called the police.

448
00:31:51.118 --> 00:31:53.620
Dad sent in our own
private extraction team.

449
00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:57.207
and Rory was home
safe and sound a week later.

450
00:31:57.207 --> 00:32:00.877
And the kidnappers
were never found.

451
00:32:00.877 --> 00:32:02.963
If you get me.

452
00:32:04.506 --> 00:32:06.007
I know.

453
00:32:06.007 --> 00:32:08.718
I know all about
your extraction team

454
00:32:08.718 --> 00:32:10.804
that you affectionately call
"the Kill Squad"

455
00:32:10.804 --> 00:32:12.597
behind closed doors.

456
00:32:12.597 --> 00:32:14.516
I also know
that they're on their way

457
00:32:14.516 --> 00:32:16.518
and how long it's gonna
take 'em to get here.

458
00:32:16.518 --> 00:32:19.437
I even know their credit ratings
and their dick sizes.

459
00:32:19.437 --> 00:32:21.106
If you get me.

460
00:32:21.106 --> 00:32:23.275
Then you should also know
you're already dead.

461
00:32:23.275 --> 00:32:25.110
We don't do ransoms.

462
00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:27.737
Again. I know. I know.

463
00:32:27.737 --> 00:32:29.739
See. I know a lot. Gertrude.

464
00:32:29.739 --> 00:32:31.491
I really do.

465
00:32:31.491 --> 00:32:34.578
Like the fact that you have
300 million in U.S. dollars

466
00:32:34.578 --> 00:32:36.705
sitting in your personal vault
downstairs.

467
00:32:36.705 --> 00:32:38.957
- The fuck?
- That's right.

468
00:32:38.957 --> 00:32:41.710
300 million that
the U.S. government

469
00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:45.172
gave Lightstone to quietly
distribute in the Middle East

470
00:32:45.172 --> 00:32:46.840
to all the worst people.

471
00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:51.011
to grease the wheels
and keep that sweet oil flowing.

472
00:32:51.011 --> 00:32:55.599
300 million that-- oops--
disappeared in the fog of war.

473
00:32:55.599 --> 00:32:58.810
Except it didn't really
disappear. did it. Gerty?

474
00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:00.145
'Cause you stole it.

475
00:33:00.145 --> 00:33:01.730
Did you know about this?

476
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:03.190
Man. this family.

477
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:06.359
This moneygrubbing family.

478
00:33:06.359 --> 00:33:08.236
Clinging desperately
to your wealth.

479
00:33:08.236 --> 00:33:10.655
when your poor employees
don't even have enough coal

480
00:33:10.655 --> 00:33:12.532
to keep Tiny Tim warm.

481
00:33:12.532 --> 00:33:15.702
What is it with you
and all this Christmas shit?

482
00:33:15.702 --> 00:33:17.495
Talk all you want.

483
00:33:17.495 --> 00:33:19.331
You'll never get in the vault.

484
00:33:19.331 --> 00:33:22.834
Oh. oh. oh. because when
you-you hit the panic button.

485
00:33:22.834 --> 00:33:24.502
it reset the combination?

486
00:33:24.502 --> 00:33:28.173
I keep telling you. I know.

487
00:33:32.969 --> 00:33:35.847
This is what breaking
into a vault has turned into?

488
00:33:35.847 --> 00:33:40.518
Remember when you just had to
drill holes and blow shit up?

489
00:33:40.518 --> 00:33:42.187
I don't know.
maybe I'm getting old.

490
00:33:42.187 --> 00:33:43.688
but there was something
romantic about that.

491
00:33:43.688 --> 00:33:45.941
Boss. you copy?

492
00:33:45.941 --> 00:33:47.901
I'm kind of busy here.

493
00:33:47.901 --> 00:33:50.362
You're gonna want to see this.

494
00:33:59.704 --> 00:34:01.373
Maybe he fell.

495
00:34:01.373 --> 00:34:02.791
You rappel down buildings
with him.

496
00:34:02.791 --> 00:34:05.210
You gonna tell me
he just fell out a window?

497
00:34:06.044 --> 00:34:08.046
All right. look lively. gang.

498
00:34:08.046 --> 00:34:09.798
We got a gopher.

499
00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:26.731
You know what?

500
00:34:26.731 --> 00:34:30.902
Um. I think Mr. Bunny
wants to go to sleep.

501
00:34:30.902 --> 00:34:32.904
So. let's tuck him in.

502
00:34:32.904 --> 00:34:34.531
Okay?

503
00:34:35.699 --> 00:34:37.409
It's gonna be okay.

504
00:34:51.298 --> 00:34:53.842
Hello? Santa?

505
00:34:53.842 --> 00:34:55.802
Are you there?

506
00:35:01.641 --> 00:35:03.393
Shit.

507
00:35:07.522 --> 00:35:10.150
This is
Candy Cane at checkpoint three.

508
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:11.860
Oh. shit.

509
00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:13.653
Shit. Shit. Shit.

510
00:35:16.823 --> 00:35:18.742
Video game.

511
00:35:19.909 --> 00:35:21.244
Video game.

512
00:35:21.244 --> 00:35:23.455
Didn't anybody ask
for a bat or a sword

513
00:35:23.455 --> 00:35:26.583
- or Molotov cocktails?

514
00:35:35.091 --> 00:35:36.801
Wait.

515
00:35:51.566 --> 00:35:53.234
Mommy. I love you.

516
00:35:54.778 --> 00:35:56.654
Poetry book.

517
00:35:56.654 --> 00:35:59.115
Die Hard on Blu-ray. Fuck!

518
00:36:13.254 --> 00:36:15.215
Safety's on. dipshit.

519
00:36:26.017 --> 00:36:27.977
Wait. Hang on. Hang on.

520
00:36:29.354 --> 00:36:31.940
Wait. wait. wait.
wait. wait. wait. Look.

521
00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:33.358
I don't want to kill you.

522
00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:41.116
Wow. a big fat guy. gray beard.

523
00:36:41.116 --> 00:36:43.201
Eh?

524
00:36:43.743 --> 00:36:45.787
Santa...

525
00:36:45.787 --> 00:36:47.831
I'm gonna rip
your fucking balls off.

526
00:37:01.302 --> 00:37:03.221
Oh. shit.

527
00:38:48.034 --> 00:38:50.370
Ah. God.

528
00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:52.080
Whew.

529
00:38:53.122 --> 00:38:56.084
Whew. Whew.

530
00:38:56.084 --> 00:38:58.169
This is Candy Cane checking in.

531
00:38:58.169 --> 00:38:59.879
Compound is clear and secured.

532
00:39:02.006 --> 00:39:04.092
Copy. What's the
status on the Kill Squad?

533
00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.512
Kill Squad
won't be here for two hours.

534
00:39:07.512 --> 00:39:10.390
So we're doing good. The outer
seal's already been breached.

535
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:13.017
Is there a 911 thing on here?

536
00:39:13.017 --> 00:39:15.520
My...

537
00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.480
Am I doing that correct?

538
00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:18.815
Hello?

539
00:39:18.815 --> 00:39:20.775
Hello. can anybody hear me?

540
00:39:20.775 --> 00:39:23.361
Can you hear me. Santa?

541
00:39:25.196 --> 00:39:26.447
Hello?

542
00:39:26.447 --> 00:39:28.032
Santa?

543
00:39:31.202 --> 00:39:32.954
Yeah. this is Santa.

544
00:39:35.707 --> 00:39:38.376
I hope I'm not bothering you.

545
00:39:39.752 --> 00:39:42.630
Daddy said you were
very busy tonight.

546
00:39:44.382 --> 00:39:46.301
I'm...

547
00:39:46.301 --> 00:39:48.511
I'm on a break.

548
00:39:48.511 --> 00:39:50.722
Who-who am I speaking to?

549
00:39:53.141 --> 00:39:55.018
My name is Trudy Lightstone.

550
00:39:55.018 --> 00:39:58.479
and I've been very good
this year.

551
00:39:58.479 --> 00:40:00.398
Trudy...

552
00:40:02.609 --> 00:40:04.736
Trudy Lightstone.

553
00:40:13.578 --> 00:40:15.788
Yeah. Trudy.

554
00:40:15.788 --> 00:40:18.166
You're on my nice list.

555
00:40:18.166 --> 00:40:20.710
You've been a very good girl
this year.

556
00:40:22.253 --> 00:40:24.464
Where are you now. Trudy?

557
00:40:25.715 --> 00:40:28.551
I'm in a big room
with all my relatives.

558
00:40:28.551 --> 00:40:31.929
There's two bad men with guns
watching us.

559
00:40:34.515 --> 00:40:36.225
Oh. no. Six left.

560
00:40:36.225 --> 00:40:38.561
Are you gonna help us. Santa?

561
00:40:39.687 --> 00:40:41.689
Yeah. Of course
I'm gonna help you.

562
00:40:41.689 --> 00:40:44.400
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna get you out of there.

563
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:47.987
Take all these bad guys
on my naughty list...

564
00:40:48.863 --> 00:40:51.366
I'm gonna take a lump of coal.

565
00:40:51.366 --> 00:40:55.328
each and every one of them.
and shove it straight up...

566
00:40:55.328 --> 00:40:56.621
The ass.

567
00:40:59.457 --> 00:41:01.000
Well. I mean. come on. sweetie.

568
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.961
We want to keep you
on the nice list. you know.

569
00:41:05.296 --> 00:41:07.882
Sorry.
Can I say "butthole." then?

570
00:41:08.675 --> 00:41:10.176
I mean. it's borderline.

571
00:41:10.176 --> 00:41:11.803
How about "anus"?

572
00:41:11.803 --> 00:41:16.140
Technically. yes.
uh. "anus" is the tech...

573
00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.975
Okay. look. uh. Tru...
uh. Trudy.

574
00:41:17.975 --> 00:41:20.728
I got to call for help.
and the phone lines are down.

575
00:41:20.728 --> 00:41:23.398
You probably know this house
better than anybody.

576
00:41:23.398 --> 00:41:25.316
You got any suggestions?

577
00:41:25.316 --> 00:41:26.943
I have an idea.

578
00:41:29.195 --> 00:41:31.781
All right. you're telling me
there's a goddamn Santa Claus

579
00:41:31.781 --> 00:41:33.700
running around here?

580
00:41:36.869 --> 00:41:38.913
Okay. well.
he looks jolly as fuck.

581
00:41:38.913 --> 00:41:40.456
but who the hell is he?

582
00:41:40.456 --> 00:41:42.667
There's no Santa listed
on the employee manifest.

583
00:41:42.667 --> 00:41:44.001
Yeah. there's more.

584
00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:45.712
Frosty hasn't checked in.
I can't reach him.

585
00:41:45.712 --> 00:41:47.672
All right. keep trying.

586
00:41:50.341 --> 00:41:51.884
All right. it's official.

587
00:41:51.884 --> 00:41:53.803
We got a gopher on the loose.
and he's dangerous.

588
00:41:53.803 --> 00:41:55.221
Watch your backs.

589
00:42:00.184 --> 00:42:02.937
Al? Al?

590
00:42:09.152 --> 00:42:11.028
Oh. shit.

591
00:42:18.703 --> 00:42:20.371
Oh. shit!

592
00:42:20.371 --> 00:42:23.708
Frosty. what's your status?

593
00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:29.213
Frosty. sound off.

594
00:42:30.214 --> 00:42:33.092
Uh. Frosty?

595
00:42:34.385 --> 00:42:35.845
Is-is that. uh...

596
00:42:35.845 --> 00:42:37.764
is that the naughty guy
I met in the basement?

597
00:42:37.764 --> 00:42:39.474
Your-your friend is dead.

598
00:42:39.474 --> 00:42:42.727
Uh. he got a star in his face.
then his head caught on fire.

599
00:42:42.727 --> 00:42:44.645
It's a long story.

600
00:42:44.645 --> 00:42:47.482
Oh.

601
00:42:47.482 --> 00:42:49.650
Is this... is this our Santy?

602
00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:52.570
Is this our... our Santy Claus?

603
00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:54.155
Yeah. it is.

604
00:42:54.947 --> 00:42:56.866
To whom am I speaking?

605
00:42:56.866 --> 00:42:58.868
Well. for tonight.
I'm Mr. Scrooge.

606
00:42:58.868 --> 00:43:02.789
Now. what is it
that you want exactly. Santa?

607
00:43:02.789 --> 00:43:05.333
I want you to put down
your weapons.

608
00:43:05.333 --> 00:43:08.252
I want you to let
this family go.

609
00:43:08.252 --> 00:43:10.129
and then I want to find
my reindeer.

610
00:43:10.129 --> 00:43:12.632
and I want to continue
delivering my presents.

611
00:43:15.384 --> 00:43:16.928
Are you fucking with me?

612
00:43:16.928 --> 00:43:19.222
All right. who the hell
are you really. huh?

613
00:43:19.222 --> 00:43:21.849
Some security guard who's
watched too many action flicks?

614
00:43:21.849 --> 00:43:24.310
Some loser ex-cop
stuck in a mall

615
00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:26.562
playing dress-up with fat kids
pissing on your lap?

616
00:43:26.562 --> 00:43:27.980
Stop me when I get it right.

617
00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:30.274
It's a little more complicated
than that.

618
00:43:30.274 --> 00:43:31.901
Not to me. it's not.

619
00:43:31.901 --> 00:43:33.903
'Cause I want to make it
my personal mission.

620
00:43:33.903 --> 00:43:38.241
my holiday to-do list.
to find you and to end you

621
00:43:38.241 --> 00:43:41.911
and to wipe my ass with you
and this whole fucking holiday.

622
00:43:41.911 --> 00:43:44.455
That's what I want
for Christmas. Santa.

623
00:43:44.455 --> 00:43:48.584
That is a terrible thing
to want for Christmas.

624
00:43:48.584 --> 00:43:52.338
But maybe you and I should
discuss that in person.

625
00:43:53.631 --> 00:43:56.300
Santa Claus is coming to town.

626
00:44:07.687 --> 00:44:09.146
Shit.

627
00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:20.324
All right. who did you hire

628
00:44:20.324 --> 00:44:22.994
to play Santa at
your Christmas party. huh?

629
00:44:22.994 --> 00:44:25.037
- I said. who's playing Santa

630
00:44:25.037 --> 00:44:26.497
at your fucked-up
Christmas party?

631
00:44:26.497 --> 00:44:29.417
I didn't hire a Santa.

632
00:44:29.417 --> 00:44:32.378
I never have a Santa.
It's tacky.

633
00:44:32.378 --> 00:44:33.754
So. who is he?

634
00:44:36.591 --> 00:44:39.468
Huh? Who is he?

635
00:44:39.468 --> 00:44:41.012
Somebody better start talking.

636
00:44:41.012 --> 00:44:44.098
or I'm gonna bash
her brains in with this...

637
00:44:44.098 --> 00:44:48.686
Damn. Gertrude. You really got
a thing for nutcrackers. huh?

638
00:44:49.854 --> 00:44:53.733
So. I'm gonna torture
everyone in your family

639
00:44:53.733 --> 00:44:56.819
until you tell me who's
running around your mansion

640
00:44:56.819 --> 00:44:59.572
playing Santa
and fucking with my shit.

641
00:44:59.572 --> 00:45:01.574
And who should I pick first?

642
00:45:01.574 --> 00:45:02.992
Should I go by age?

643
00:45:02.992 --> 00:45:04.660
- Shh.

644
00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:06.329
Or should I go by IQ?

645
00:45:06.329 --> 00:45:09.790
Pick Jason.
He's my mom's favorite.

646
00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:11.834
- Yep. Him.
- The one in the sweater.

647
00:45:11.834 --> 00:45:14.211
All right.
Jason Lightstone it is.

648
00:45:14.211 --> 00:45:15.463
- The number one son.
- No.

649
00:45:15.463 --> 00:45:16.964
Wait. wait. wait.
No. we don't need...

650
00:45:16.964 --> 00:45:18.382
We don't need to do that.
No. it's okay.

651
00:45:18.382 --> 00:45:20.551
No. No. no. no.
We don't need to do this.

652
00:45:20.551 --> 00:45:21.761
No. No. no. no. no.

653
00:45:21.761 --> 00:45:23.262
Don't. don't. don't.

654
00:45:23.262 --> 00:45:25.556
- No. don't... Put it...
Don't... No. -

655
00:45:25.556 --> 00:45:27.767
- No. no. no. no. No. no.
- Give me this fucking...

656
00:45:36.776 --> 00:45:39.487
I'm telling you.
no one hired a Santa.

657
00:45:39.487 --> 00:45:41.113
All right. all right.
all right. You're right.

658
00:45:41.113 --> 00:45:42.156
You're right.
Let's stop it. Let's stop it.

659
00:45:42.156 --> 00:45:44.283
What are we doing here? Come on.

660
00:45:44.283 --> 00:45:47.370
What are we. amateurs?
We're half-assing this.

661
00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:50.498
Come on. It's not called
a finger cracker.

662
00:45:51.707 --> 00:45:53.668
Okay. Candy Cane.

663
00:45:53.668 --> 00:45:55.044
Stick one of his bozaks
in there.

664
00:45:55.044 --> 00:45:56.253
I'm not touching his balls.

665
00:45:56.253 --> 00:45:57.964
What. are you a princess
all of a sudden?

666
00:45:57.964 --> 00:45:59.590
I've seen you
scoop out brains before.

667
00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:01.050
You want me
to scoop his brains out.

668
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:02.593
I'll scoop his brains out
right now.

669
00:46:02.593 --> 00:46:03.761
but I'm not touching his junk.

670
00:46:03.761 --> 00:46:05.179
I don't care who does it.

671
00:46:05.179 --> 00:46:06.764
I better be looking
at flat balls.

672
00:46:06.764 --> 00:46:08.015
like. in three seconds.

673
00:46:08.015 --> 00:46:10.601
I'll do it.

674
00:46:10.601 --> 00:46:11.894
Krampus. Perfect.

675
00:46:11.894 --> 00:46:13.270
Oh. not that guy. Not that guy.

676
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:14.772
That's what I love
about sociopaths.

677
00:46:14.772 --> 00:46:16.065
Always up for trying new things.

678
00:46:16.065 --> 00:46:17.400
You don't need to do this. okay?

679
00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.318
No. it's all right.
Um... Oh. no.

680
00:46:19.318 --> 00:46:21.862
No. no. no. no. no. no. no.
Oh. my God. Oh. my God.

681
00:46:21.862 --> 00:46:24.407
Oh. God. Oh. my God.

682
00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:27.576
Put your nuts in.

683
00:46:27.576 --> 00:46:28.953
Yummy. yummy.

684
00:46:28.953 --> 00:46:31.706
Stop hurting my daddy...

685
00:46:31.706 --> 00:46:34.125
or Santa will get mad.

686
00:46:34.959 --> 00:46:37.169
Ah. what a cutie.

687
00:46:37.169 --> 00:46:39.255
So. what do we know
about Santa. little one?

688
00:46:39.255 --> 00:46:41.173
She doesn't know anything
about Santa.

689
00:46:42.049 --> 00:46:43.801
He wasn't asking you.

690
00:46:43.801 --> 00:46:46.220
She's playing make-believe.

691
00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:48.472
She's pretending
to talk to Santa.

692
00:46:48.472 --> 00:46:50.474
It's not pretend.
Santa's my friend.

693
00:46:50.474 --> 00:46:52.393
and he said
he's going to save us.

694
00:46:52.393 --> 00:46:53.477
No.

695
00:46:53.477 --> 00:46:55.730
- And beat you up.
- Oh. is he?

696
00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:58.274
I bet he'd come out of hiding
if you asked him to. huh?

697
00:46:58.274 --> 00:46:59.859
What do you say you come with me

698
00:46:59.859 --> 00:47:02.111
- and we play a little game
with him. huh? -No. no. no.

699
00:47:02.111 --> 00:47:03.487
Trudy. come on.
Tell him the truth now.

700
00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:05.322
- You aren't talking to Santa.
- Yes. I am.

701
00:47:05.322 --> 00:47:06.657
No. you're not. Come on. now.

702
00:47:06.657 --> 00:47:09.493
- Yes. I am. -Damn it. Trudy.
Santa isn't real!

703
00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:19.503
I'm sorry. honey.

704
00:47:20.463 --> 00:47:22.673
Santa's just a thing
adults tell kids

705
00:47:22.673 --> 00:47:24.884
to make them feel better. okay?

706
00:47:26.886 --> 00:47:29.013
Your mommy and I
give you the presents.

707
00:47:29.013 --> 00:47:31.015
and we say they're from Santa.

708
00:47:32.183 --> 00:47:33.768
He's not coming to save us.

709
00:47:33.768 --> 00:47:35.978
He doesn't exist.

710
00:47:35.978 --> 00:47:38.397
It's all made-up.

711
00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:41.734
- Really?
- Aw.

712
00:47:41.734 --> 00:47:44.570
What a way to find out
that there's no Santa.

713
00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:46.614
Hey. let's come back Easter
and ruin the Easter Bunny

714
00:47:46.614 --> 00:47:48.783
- for her. too. huh?

715
00:47:48.783 --> 00:47:50.201
- Trudy!
- Come back here!

716
00:47:50.201 --> 00:47:51.660
- Stop her!
- Trudy! -Hey!

717
00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:53.162
You idiots. stay at your posts.

718
00:47:53.162 --> 00:47:54.622
Trudy!

719
00:47:54.622 --> 00:47:56.957
I'll find this little brat.

720
00:49:03.065 --> 00:49:04.483
Okay.

721
00:49:33.095 --> 00:49:36.098
Santa. Santa.

722
00:49:36.098 --> 00:49:37.975
- Santa!

723
00:49:39.643 --> 00:49:41.478
This is Trudy.

724
00:49:42.313 --> 00:49:45.482
- Are you okay. Santa?

725
00:49:47.568 --> 00:49:48.986
Hi. Hey.

726
00:49:48.986 --> 00:49:50.821
Are you okay?

727
00:49:50.821 --> 00:49:52.656
I'm good. Uh...

728
00:49:52.656 --> 00:49:55.034
I was just wrapping
something up.

729
00:49:55.034 --> 00:49:57.244
I ran away and hid in the attic.

730
00:49:57.244 --> 00:50:00.497
Okay. If you're safe...

731
00:50:00.497 --> 00:50:03.500
uh. just stay there
and. uh. stay quiet. all right?

732
00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:08.339
Okay. I can set up booby traps.
like in Home Alone.

733
00:50:08.339 --> 00:50:10.007
Okay. I don't know
what that means.

734
00:50:10.007 --> 00:50:11.717
but. uh. yeah. do that.

735
00:50:11.717 --> 00:50:13.636
Just do it quietly.

736
00:50:15.012 --> 00:50:17.014
Are you really Santa?

737
00:50:20.851 --> 00:50:22.853
Of course I am. sweetheart.

738
00:50:23.729 --> 00:50:26.607
My daddy says
there isn't any Santa.

739
00:50:28.025 --> 00:50:31.237
He says parents just tell
their kids that Santa's real

740
00:50:31.237 --> 00:50:32.947
to make them feel better.

741
00:50:32.947 --> 00:50:35.824
He said they give us presents

742
00:50:35.824 --> 00:50:38.118
and say they're from Santa.

743
00:50:38.118 --> 00:50:40.246
Yeah.

744
00:50:40.246 --> 00:50:42.498
Yeah. a lot of parents say that.

745
00:50:42.498 --> 00:50:46.543
But I still bring presents
to kids that need me.

746
00:50:47.836 --> 00:50:50.130
Kids who really believe.

747
00:50:51.382 --> 00:50:54.301
How do you know
who really needs you?

748
00:50:54.301 --> 00:50:56.512
Christmas magic.

749
00:50:56.512 --> 00:50:58.806
I'm not really sure
how it works.

750
00:51:06.605 --> 00:51:08.899
But. uh...

751
00:51:11.068 --> 00:51:14.196
I remember. um...

752
00:51:14.196 --> 00:51:16.115
when Trudy Lightstone
wrote to me.

753
00:51:16.115 --> 00:51:18.534
She must have been
about six years old.

754
00:51:18.534 --> 00:51:22.371
and she said that
she felt lonely sometimes.

755
00:51:22.371 --> 00:51:24.790
She missed having a best friend.

756
00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:26.125
And so I brought her

757
00:51:26.125 --> 00:51:28.002
a beautiful little
stuffed rabbit.

758
00:51:28.002 --> 00:51:29.378
Mr. Bunny.

759
00:51:29.378 --> 00:51:31.338
And then I remember
the next year.

760
00:51:31.338 --> 00:51:33.465
and you said you had
this amazing dream

761
00:51:33.465 --> 00:51:37.511
and that. afterwards.
all you wanted to do was...

762
00:51:37.511 --> 00:51:38.762
To fly!

763
00:51:38.762 --> 00:51:41.181
To fly. To fly.

764
00:51:42.433 --> 00:51:46.895
I mean. Santa might have
some magic. but...

765
00:51:46.895 --> 00:51:50.607
making a little girl fly?

766
00:51:52.776 --> 00:51:56.864
But giving you a kite.

767
00:51:56.864 --> 00:52:00.326
floating just beneath
the clouds.

768
00:52:00.326 --> 00:52:03.162
well. it's about
as good as it gets.

769
00:52:03.162 --> 00:52:05.039
I knew it.

770
00:52:05.039 --> 00:52:07.416
I knew you were real. Santa.

771
00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:13.130
Don't be too hard
on your parents. all right?

772
00:52:14.882 --> 00:52:17.718
Grown-ups have a hard time
believing things.

773
00:52:18.552 --> 00:52:20.846
Can you use your Christmas magic

774
00:52:20.846 --> 00:52:23.182
to make them
love each other again?

775
00:52:23.182 --> 00:52:25.726
I wish I had that kind of power.

776
00:52:26.518 --> 00:52:30.272
Mrs. Claus and I have been
going on year. uh.

777
00:52:30.272 --> 00:52:32.566
1.100. and...

778
00:52:33.442 --> 00:52:36.278
Grown-up relationships
are complicated.

779
00:52:37.112 --> 00:52:39.323
It takes work.

780
00:52:39.323 --> 00:52:41.450
A lot of work.

781
00:52:43.577 --> 00:52:45.996
Do you still love her?

782
00:52:45.996 --> 00:52:47.831
Yeah. I do.

783
00:52:48.791 --> 00:52:52.336
And sometimes. even if you want
to make somebody happy...

784
00:52:53.545 --> 00:52:55.839
...the magic just goes away.

785
00:52:57.883 --> 00:53:00.219
Hey.

786
00:53:00.219 --> 00:53:02.012
I've got an idea.

787
00:53:02.012 --> 00:53:03.639
This will be fun.

788
00:53:04.681 --> 00:53:07.935
Why don't you guys
open your presents?

789
00:53:07.935 --> 00:53:12.231
I want to see what you
rich assholes get each other.

790
00:53:12.231 --> 00:53:18.195
And some of you might not
make it till tomorrow morning.

791
00:53:18.195 --> 00:53:21.198
so this could be
your only chance.

792
00:53:22.032 --> 00:53:23.492
Come on.

793
00:53:23.492 --> 00:53:26.245
Where's the Christmas spirit?

794
00:53:27.788 --> 00:53:29.873
Uh...

795
00:53:30.749 --> 00:53:35.170
Gertrude. uh. I got you
something pretty special.

796
00:53:35.170 --> 00:53:36.505
Did you hear that. Gertrude?

797
00:53:36.505 --> 00:53:38.465
He got you something amazing.

798
00:53:38.465 --> 00:53:41.385
Oh. what could it be?

799
00:53:41.385 --> 00:53:43.804
Oh. my God. this is exciting.

800
00:53:43.804 --> 00:53:46.014
Mom.

801
00:53:46.014 --> 00:53:47.724
Can I call you Mom?

802
00:53:48.934 --> 00:53:50.561
Mrs. Lightstone.

803
00:53:52.396 --> 00:53:55.774
Okay. so in the business.
they call this...

804
00:53:56.775 --> 00:53:58.235
...a pitch deck.

805
00:53:59.153 --> 00:54:00.237
- Pitch deck.
- Yeah.

806
00:54:00.237 --> 00:54:02.030
It's called Explosive Force.

807
00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:03.574
Starring me.

808
00:54:03.574 --> 00:54:05.325
And if you look in the back.

809
00:54:05.325 --> 00:54:08.787
there are the financial numbers.

810
00:54:08.787 --> 00:54:12.332
I'm kind of a big deal in Asia.

811
00:54:13.584 --> 00:54:15.752
Parts of Asia. at least.

812
00:54:15.752 --> 00:54:17.838
We were in parts of Asia once.
and. like.

813
00:54:17.838 --> 00:54:19.590
we couldn't even go
to a restaurant.

814
00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:23.093
Ah. what is there
a better gift than...

815
00:54:23.093 --> 00:54:26.430
gift of a golden opportunity?

816
00:54:27.764 --> 00:54:30.017
Oh. no.

817
00:54:31.268 --> 00:54:33.729
Granny doesn't like it.

818
00:54:33.729 --> 00:54:36.356
Mother. I got you something
really special.

819
00:54:42.613 --> 00:54:45.282
It's a sentimental photo
of the day I was born.

820
00:54:45.282 --> 00:54:47.326
I remember.

821
00:54:47.326 --> 00:54:48.702
I was there.

822
00:54:48.702 --> 00:54:50.954
She doesn't give a shit.

823
00:54:53.415 --> 00:54:55.125
- Swing and miss again!

824
00:54:55.125 --> 00:54:56.418
This is so fun.

825
00:54:56.418 --> 00:54:57.628
Mommy. how about another one?

826
00:54:57.628 --> 00:54:59.338
I got you a lot of good things.

827
00:54:59.338 --> 00:55:01.381
- I'll grab one.
- Alva. Alva. sit down.

828
00:55:01.381 --> 00:55:03.133
You've already given me one.
It's...

829
00:55:03.133 --> 00:55:04.384
It's Jason's turn.

830
00:55:04.384 --> 00:55:05.802
Uh...

831
00:55:05.802 --> 00:55:09.264
I th... I-I think
I left it in the car.

832
00:55:09.264 --> 00:55:11.517
No. I-I saw you put one
under the tree earlier.

833
00:55:11.517 --> 00:55:13.894
- No. It's in the...
- Yeah. I did.

834
00:55:13.894 --> 00:55:16.980
I could've sworn.
You know what. it's. uh...

835
00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:19.066
Y-You don't... you don't...
you don't... you...

836
00:55:19.066 --> 00:55:21.693
It's this one. right?
Yeah. I got you. bro.

837
00:55:21.693 --> 00:55:23.153
Come on.

838
00:55:24.905 --> 00:55:26.949
Thank you.

839
00:55:27.991 --> 00:55:30.202
It's my favorite whiskey.

840
00:55:30.202 --> 00:55:32.871
You can skip the note.

841
00:55:56.228 --> 00:55:57.980
Thank you. Jason.

842
00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:05.696
What's the card say?

843
00:56:05.696 --> 00:56:08.615
I think I'll just keep that
between Jason and I.

844
00:56:08.615 --> 00:56:12.744
No one really needs to know.
Right. Jason?

845
00:56:15.205 --> 00:56:16.915
Right.

846
00:56:17.874 --> 00:56:20.252
Did you ever have
a mommy and daddy?

847
00:56:22.045 --> 00:56:24.089
Yeah. of course
I had a mommy and daddy.

848
00:56:24.089 --> 00:56:27.759
I wasn't...
I wasn't always Santa Claus.

849
00:56:28.594 --> 00:56:30.887
I had a life before this.

850
00:56:31.805 --> 00:56:34.558
A long. long. long time ago.

851
00:56:38.729 --> 00:56:41.857
They used to call me. uh...

852
00:56:41.857 --> 00:56:43.775
Nicomund.

853
00:56:47.529 --> 00:56:49.156
Nicomund the Red.

854
00:56:50.741 --> 00:56:53.493
You had a different job then?

855
00:56:53.493 --> 00:56:56.246
Yeah. you could say that.

856
00:56:56.246 --> 00:56:58.123
I was a warrior.

857
00:56:58.123 --> 00:57:00.208
A raider. A thief.

858
00:57:00.208 --> 00:57:04.004
- And if somebody got in my way.

859
00:57:04.004 --> 00:57:05.756
me and Skullcrusher would...

860
00:57:05.756 --> 00:57:07.424
Who's Skullcrusher?

861
00:57:08.258 --> 00:57:11.386
Skullcrusher's my. uh...

862
00:57:11.386 --> 00:57:14.097
my hammer.

863
00:57:14.097 --> 00:57:16.350
My favorite hammer.

864
00:57:16.350 --> 00:57:18.727
I was a surgeon with that thing.

865
00:57:18.727 --> 00:57:21.188
Used to be able to take
three heads. line 'em up...

866
00:57:22.773 --> 00:57:25.359
But why?

867
00:57:25.359 --> 00:57:26.818
What?

868
00:57:26.818 --> 00:57:29.446
Why'd you do those things?

869
00:57:31.406 --> 00:57:33.492
Because I was mean.

870
00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:36.787
And I was greedy.

871
00:57:38.622 --> 00:57:41.416
And I wanted gold. jewels.

872
00:57:41.416 --> 00:57:44.127
Yeah. I mean. if there was
a naughty list back then.

873
00:57:44.127 --> 00:57:46.129
I'd be top dog.

874
00:57:47.714 --> 00:57:49.841
Well. maybe...

875
00:57:50.842 --> 00:57:52.052
What?

876
00:57:52.052 --> 00:57:54.179
Maybe all those bad things
you used to do...

877
00:57:55.263 --> 00:57:58.558
...maybe you can use them
to do good things instead.

878
00:57:59.351 --> 00:58:01.645
To help.

879
00:58:01.645 --> 00:58:03.563
What do you mean?

880
00:58:03.563 --> 00:58:07.943
Mr. Bunny. he wasn't just a toy.

881
00:58:07.943 --> 00:58:11.363
That night. you gave me
what I wished for.

882
00:58:11.363 --> 00:58:13.240
A best friend.

883
00:58:14.282 --> 00:58:16.910
'Cause you're good and kind.

884
00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:20.497
And you mean more than just
the presents you bring.

885
00:58:20.497 --> 00:58:23.166
That's why I believe in you.
Santa.

886
00:58:23.166 --> 00:58:25.585
That's why I believe.

887
00:58:31.174 --> 00:58:32.843
Thank you.

888
00:58:34.678 --> 00:58:38.640
You stay hidden. Trudy.
till I come get you.

889
00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:40.559
Stay safe.

890
00:58:41.518 --> 00:58:44.438
All right.
we got satellite confirmation.

891
00:58:44.438 --> 00:58:46.565
Extraction team's on the go.

892
00:58:46.565 --> 00:58:48.859
30 minutes.

893
00:58:48.859 --> 00:58:50.527
We're on schedule.

894
00:58:50.527 --> 00:58:51.945
Everything's good.

895
00:58:51.945 --> 00:58:53.530
- All right. fellas.

896
00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:54.948
Look alive. look alive.

897
00:58:54.948 --> 00:58:56.867
You all know the plan.

898
00:58:56.867 --> 00:59:00.245
and I like my operations

899
00:59:00.245 --> 00:59:03.039
hard and fast
with minimal cleanup.

900
00:59:03.039 --> 00:59:07.586
Now. some idiot gets
in your way. what do you do?

901
00:59:07.586 --> 00:59:09.671
Fuck their shit up right!

902
00:59:09.671 --> 00:59:11.339
Damn right.

903
00:59:12.132 --> 00:59:14.843
- Time to lube up.

904
00:59:15.969 --> 00:59:18.680
Let's go. motherfuckers!
Let's go!

905
00:59:24.603 --> 00:59:26.855
This fucking family.

906
00:59:46.124 --> 00:59:48.376
Ho. ho. ho. ho.

907
00:59:48.376 --> 00:59:50.170
- Merry Christmas.

908
00:59:50.170 --> 00:59:51.421
Happy holidays.

909
00:59:51.421 --> 00:59:52.547
Traitor.

910
00:59:54.007 --> 00:59:56.009
I got him in the east wing.

911
00:59:56.009 --> 00:59:58.470
All right.
we're on our way. Hold him.

912
01:00:11.775 --> 01:00:13.777
Step aside.

913
01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:30.085
Now. how did this tired. old.

914
01:00:30.085 --> 01:00:32.754
fat piece of shit
get the drop on us?

915
01:00:32.754 --> 01:00:34.214
I don't know.

916
01:00:34.214 --> 01:00:36.216
He's not even armed.

917
01:00:36.216 --> 01:00:38.635
This bag is the only thing
he had on him.

918
01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:40.053
What's in there?

919
01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:42.848
Can't see anything.

920
01:00:46.935 --> 01:00:48.395
Here. give it to me.

921
01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:01.992
What kind of moron...

922
01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:04.244
carries a chess set with him?

923
01:01:07.873 --> 01:01:09.416
What the fuck?

924
01:01:09.416 --> 01:01:11.960
Doesn't make any sense.
Look at all this shit.

925
01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:22.178
So. you're gonna tell us what's
the gimmick with the bag?

926
01:01:22.178 --> 01:01:23.847
It's magic.

927
01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:26.766
You put your hand in.
out comes a present.

928
01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:31.104
I don't really understand
how it works. either.

929
01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:35.525
So. you're Mr. Scrooge.

930
01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:37.527
That's right.

931
01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:39.321
But who are you?

932
01:01:39.321 --> 01:01:41.364
Weihnachtsmann.

933
01:01:42.741 --> 01:01:44.701
Julenissen.

934
01:01:45.577 --> 01:01:47.495
ShÃ¨ngdÃ n LaorÃ©n.

935
01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:51.541
Babbo Natale. PÃ¨re Noel.
Kris Kringle.

936
01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:54.044
Jolly old Saint Nick.

937
01:01:54.044 --> 01:01:57.088
People call me a lot of things.

938
01:01:57.923 --> 01:02:00.550
Ha. ha. ha. Very funny.

939
01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:02.928
Or should I say. "Ho. ho. ho"?

940
01:02:02.928 --> 01:02:06.514
If you're Santa.
where's your reindeer?

941
01:02:06.514 --> 01:02:08.350
They were on the roof

942
01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:10.977
until that guy I turned
into an ice kebab just...

943
01:02:13.605 --> 01:02:15.231
You don't believe me?

944
01:02:15.231 --> 01:02:16.358
Go check.

945
01:02:16.358 --> 01:02:19.110
Prancer left
a tasty log up there.

946
01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:20.946
This fucking guy.

947
01:02:20.946 --> 01:02:22.656
You don't think...

948
01:02:22.656 --> 01:02:25.825
Now. I know you're an idiot.
but don't be an idiot out loud.

949
01:02:25.825 --> 01:02:27.911
Come on.
he's just in Santy Claus

950
01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:29.913
with a fucking trick bag.

951
01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:31.915
Oh. no!

952
01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:33.750
That bag was full
of kids' dreams!

953
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:35.543
Oh. come on.

954
01:02:35.543 --> 01:02:37.837
Everybody knows that
Christmas dreams are bullshit.

955
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:41.257
My father used to make
a big deal out of it

956
01:02:41.257 --> 01:02:43.051
every Christmas.

957
01:02:43.051 --> 01:02:45.220
Every freaking Christmas
with the presents

958
01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:47.430
and the candy
and the decorations

959
01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:51.226
and the Christmas caroling
and all that bullshit.

960
01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:54.896
And then when I was...

961
01:02:54.896 --> 01:02:58.316
I don't know. ten. 11.

962
01:02:58.316 --> 01:03:00.276
he got laid off.
and that Christmas.

963
01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:01.778
couldn't even afford a tree.

964
01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:03.321
No Christmas dinner. no gifts.

965
01:03:03.321 --> 01:03:05.949
Nothing. nada. culo. dick.

966
01:03:06.741 --> 01:03:08.118
But our neighbors...

967
01:03:08.118 --> 01:03:09.995
our neighbors.
oh. they had it all.

968
01:03:09.995 --> 01:03:11.788
I could see
all that yuletide cheer

969
01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:14.332
through their window mocking me.

970
01:03:14.332 --> 01:03:18.253
So Christmas Eve
rolls around. and...

971
01:03:18.253 --> 01:03:21.297
I waited for everybody
to go to bed.

972
01:03:21.297 --> 01:03:24.634
And then I snuck in there
to take it all.

973
01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:28.179
Only problem was that
the gramps got up to take a piss

974
01:03:28.179 --> 01:03:30.598
and the two of us scared
the shit out of each other.

975
01:03:30.598 --> 01:03:33.643
And. um. he fell down the stairs

976
01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:38.189
and-and broke his neck.
and he died in the hospital.

977
01:03:38.189 --> 01:03:39.816
Everybody thought that I did it.

978
01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:41.317
and every time
I tried to tell them.

979
01:03:41.317 --> 01:03:43.820
I tried to tell them that...

980
01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.657
Anyway. maybe I did do it.

981
01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:49.701
Maybe I did push him.

982
01:03:49.701 --> 01:03:51.494
Poor old fucker.

983
01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:54.998
So. you see.
Christmas ruined my life.

984
01:03:54.998 --> 01:03:56.666
Okay? But you know what?

985
01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:58.001
It set me on the path

986
01:03:58.001 --> 01:04:00.045
and made me the great man
that I am today.

987
01:04:00.045 --> 01:04:02.088
I'm sorry. Jimmy.

988
01:04:02.881 --> 01:04:04.424
I really am.

989
01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:07.302
But I do gifts.
I do Christmas cheer.

990
01:04:07.302 --> 01:04:09.512
I don't get involved
in people's lives.

991
01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:13.391
Oh. yeah? Yeah. well.
maybe you fucking should!

992
01:04:17.896 --> 01:04:21.066
Um. how did he know your name?

993
01:04:21.066 --> 01:04:22.776
Oh. Bjorn.

994
01:04:22.776 --> 01:04:24.903
What's your excuse?

995
01:04:24.903 --> 01:04:26.488
Huh?

996
01:04:26.488 --> 01:04:29.824
Didn't I get you that Huffy bike
you wanted back in '82?

997
01:04:29.824 --> 01:04:33.036
One you wrote me 50 times about!

998
01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:34.537
What about you. Kira?

999
01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:37.707
Well. you made your brother
eat worms.

1000
01:04:37.707 --> 01:04:39.209
That's naughty!

1001
01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:41.127
Okay. how does he know
about my bike?

1002
01:04:41.127 --> 01:04:44.547
"Hey. do you like big tits?"

1003
01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:46.758
Come on. every kid wants
a fucking bike.

1004
01:04:46.758 --> 01:04:49.886
- You're gonna tell me who you
work for... -Oh. Christ. No.

1005
01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:53.181
...then you've got five seconds
to tell me who you really are.

1006
01:04:53.181 --> 01:04:56.017
Five. four. three. two...

1007
01:04:56.017 --> 01:04:57.727
I'm Santa Claus!

1008
01:04:57.727 --> 01:05:00.021
Well. not anymore.

1009
01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:26.756
Is it snowing?

1010
01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:30.176
Is he doing this
with Santa magic?

1011
01:05:36.683 --> 01:05:39.060
Let it snow!

1012
01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.782
It's not snow.

1013
01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:54.117
It's Styrofoam.

1014
01:05:54.117 --> 01:05:56.369
I told you this guy's
a big phony.

1015
01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.677
Where'd he go?

1016
01:06:12.677 --> 01:06:14.304
He went up the chimney.

1017
01:06:14.304 --> 01:06:15.972
- I saw it.
- I don't know.

1018
01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:17.807
he had a rig
or some pulley system

1019
01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:19.809
- that just yanked him up.
- You can't fit up there.

1020
01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:21.519
- It's impossible.
- Oh. you see one weird thing.

1021
01:06:21.519 --> 01:06:23.855
and then you think
you're in a fairy tale?

1022
01:06:23.855 --> 01:06:25.148
Incoming.

1023
01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:26.024
We've got sleigh bells
approaching.

1024
01:06:26.024 --> 01:06:27.817
Oh. my God.

1025
01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:29.694
It's his reindeer.

1026
01:06:31.321 --> 01:06:33.323
- It's the extraction team.

1027
01:06:33.323 --> 01:06:35.533
Pull yourselves together!

1028
01:06:50.465 --> 01:06:54.761
And that is the sound
of my Kill Squad.

1029
01:06:56.221 --> 01:06:58.306
Oh. you're fizzity-fucked now.

1030
01:06:58.306 --> 01:07:00.516
Huh? What are you gonna do?
You little elf bitch.

1031
01:07:00.516 --> 01:07:01.976
Fu...

1032
01:07:01.976 --> 01:07:03.144
Bertie.

1033
01:07:03.144 --> 01:07:04.687
Hashtag "blessed."

1034
01:07:07.732 --> 01:07:10.360
Yeah!

1035
01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.361
Parkour.

1036
01:07:11.361 --> 01:07:12.528
Kill him. babe!

1037
01:07:12.528 --> 01:07:15.198
-Oh!

1038
01:07:16.074 --> 01:07:17.700
Morgan's gonna save us.

1039
01:07:19.452 --> 01:07:23.206
Jean-Claude Van Dipshit
just ditched us. sweetie.

1040
01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:32.215
Hold your fire.

1041
01:07:32.215 --> 01:07:33.841
Barrel roll!

1042
01:07:35.551 --> 01:07:36.844
Easy. easy.

1043
01:07:36.844 --> 01:07:38.763
-Yeah!
- Easy.

1044
01:07:38.763 --> 01:07:40.056
Identify yourself.

1045
01:07:40.056 --> 01:07:42.433
I'm one of the hostages.

1046
01:07:42.433 --> 01:07:45.561
Morgan Steel. the actor.

1047
01:07:45.561 --> 01:07:48.564
Played a lot of soldiers
in my career.

1048
01:07:48.564 --> 01:07:52.151
Can I just say. thank you
for your service. Semper fi.

1049
01:07:52.986 --> 01:07:54.904
What's the situation inside?

1050
01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:57.323
Bunch of ex-military guys.

1051
01:07:57.323 --> 01:07:59.325
but I got to warn you.
they know you're coming.

1052
01:07:59.325 --> 01:08:00.994
I think they're ready for you.

1053
01:08:00.994 --> 01:08:02.829
They better be.

1054
01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:04.914
We're on a tight schedule.

1055
01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:06.749
Shit.

1056
01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:12.213
Oh. f...

1057
01:08:12.213 --> 01:08:15.508
- All right. let's move out.
- Let's move out.

1058
01:08:19.679 --> 01:08:21.306
Come on.

1059
01:08:21.306 --> 01:08:23.516
You got to be kidding me.

1060
01:08:23.516 --> 01:08:25.226
Hey. Thorp.
you're ten minutes late.

1061
01:08:25.226 --> 01:08:26.602
What kept you?

1062
01:08:26.602 --> 01:08:28.938
Looks to me like your net's
got a hole in it.

1063
01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:31.399
Or are you just letting your
hostages out for some exercise?

1064
01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:33.651
No. no. no. We got
a wild gopher running around

1065
01:08:33.651 --> 01:08:36.237
complicating shit
and causing problems.

1066
01:08:36.237 --> 01:08:37.822
Who? Lightstone security?

1067
01:08:37.822 --> 01:08:39.407
Nah. I don't think so.
Some intruder dressed as Santa.

1068
01:08:39.407 --> 01:08:40.825
But I'm telling you.
I'm telling you.

1069
01:08:40.825 --> 01:08:43.036
there's something weird
about him.

1070
01:08:43.036 --> 01:08:44.662
Might be the real Santa.

1071
01:08:44.662 --> 01:08:47.123
- The fuck did she just say?
- Nothing. nothing.

1072
01:08:47.123 --> 01:08:48.207
She's joking.

1073
01:08:48.207 --> 01:08:50.710
My squad will take care of it.

1074
01:08:53.087 --> 01:08:55.798
Beta Team. go find this asshole.

1075
01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:57.800
Go.

1076
01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:02.138
Now. let's unwrap our present.
shall we?

1077
01:09:02.138 --> 01:09:04.390
All right. you heard the man.

1078
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:07.018
Time to kill Santa.

1079
01:09:07.018 --> 01:09:09.479
I've got him. He's on the roof.

1080
01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:11.773
Roger that. I got eyes on him.

1081
01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:31.167
Right. Sugarplum.
Hit that button.

1082
01:09:38.132 --> 01:09:40.009
Here we go.

1083
01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:41.386
Our skeleton key.

1084
01:09:41.386 --> 01:09:43.262
The "open" magic stick.

1085
01:09:43.262 --> 01:09:44.972
This better fucking work.

1086
01:09:44.972 --> 01:09:47.642
I'm flushing my career for this.
my reputation.

1087
01:09:47.642 --> 01:09:50.436
Yeah. well. then you can
buy yourself a new rep.

1088
01:09:59.362 --> 01:10:00.863
As a kid. I loved

1089
01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:02.907
unwrapping Christmas presents
so much

1090
01:10:02.907 --> 01:10:05.868
that my mom would wrap
empty boxes for me.

1091
01:10:06.786 --> 01:10:09.205
I didn't care
that nothing was inside.

1092
01:10:21.175 --> 01:10:23.761
Is this a fucking joke?

1093
01:10:23.761 --> 01:10:24.971
No.

1094
01:10:26.347 --> 01:10:28.266
You said it would
fucking be here!

1095
01:10:28.266 --> 01:10:31.894
I'm telling you.
my intel was rock solid.

1096
01:10:31.894 --> 01:10:34.188
I had guys on the inside.

1097
01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:38.943
300 million in cash
was delivered here yesterday

1098
01:10:38.943 --> 01:10:41.237
to this fucking mansion.

1099
01:10:46.242 --> 01:10:48.911
Somebody must've intercepted it.

1100
01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:54.959
Son of a bitch.

1101
01:11:17.356 --> 01:11:18.900
Oh. shit.

1102
01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:21.444
Santa. you okay?

1103
01:11:21.444 --> 01:11:23.029
Santa.

1104
01:11:23.029 --> 01:11:25.323
A bunch of new bad guys
showed up.

1105
01:11:25.323 --> 01:11:27.116
They're on the naughty list.

1106
01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:30.119
They got their gadgets
and their gizmos on them.

1107
01:11:30.953 --> 01:11:33.539
I'm sorry.
I think this is it. kid.

1108
01:11:33.539 --> 01:11:35.333
No. no. don't say that.

1109
01:11:35.333 --> 01:11:37.335
The naughty list...

1110
01:11:37.335 --> 01:11:39.754
just grows and grows.

1111
01:11:48.471 --> 01:11:52.308
He's in that structure.
Body cams on.

1112
01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:54.393
Don't give up.

1113
01:11:54.393 --> 01:11:56.979
You make a wish this time.
Santa.

1114
01:11:56.979 --> 01:11:58.606
Just this once.

1115
01:11:58.606 --> 01:12:01.526
If you could have anything
in this world.

1116
01:12:01.526 --> 01:12:03.778
what would it be?

1117
01:12:09.492 --> 01:12:12.537
I wish I could see
Mrs. Claus again.

1118
01:12:12.537 --> 01:12:15.665
tell her how much I love her.

1119
01:12:15.665 --> 01:12:18.501
Then you make
that wish come true.

1120
01:12:18.501 --> 01:12:20.670
- Oh. shit.

1121
01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:23.005
No. no. no. no. No. no.

1122
01:12:24.757 --> 01:12:26.175
Oh. God.

1123
01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:29.011
No.

1124
01:12:41.399 --> 01:12:44.402
You said these guys.
they're naughty.

1125
01:12:44.402 --> 01:12:47.363
And what do you do
to the naughty ones?

1126
01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:49.240
I give them a lump of coal.

1127
01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:51.492
Yeah. Give them their lumps.

1128
01:12:52.702 --> 01:12:54.996
Take that coal and shove it
straight up their...

1129
01:12:54.996 --> 01:12:57.248
- Anuses.
- Yeah!

1130
01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:04.880
They're right outside.

1131
01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:21.564
Santa's gonna eat
through these guys

1132
01:13:21.564 --> 01:13:23.691
like a plate full of cookies.

1133
01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:29.614
Move. move.

1134
01:13:33.284 --> 01:13:35.077
Hey. lock it up.

1135
01:13:36.996 --> 01:13:38.831
Lights down.

1136
01:13:39.999 --> 01:13:41.917
Stay at my back.

1137
01:13:41.917 --> 01:13:44.045
All right. we got this. boys.

1138
01:14:02.897 --> 01:14:05.274
All right. where the fuck
is my money?!

1139
01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:07.652
Where's the money?!

1140
01:14:18.287 --> 01:14:21.207
All right. I've been
a sweetheart up to now.

1141
01:14:21.207 --> 01:14:22.667
But that's all over.

1142
01:14:22.667 --> 01:14:24.460
No more fucking games!

1143
01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:25.961
Where's the money?

1144
01:14:25.961 --> 01:14:29.006
Or I will shoot every last
one of you and enjoy it.

1145
01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:35.888
- It's in the vault.
- I just looked in the vault.

1146
01:14:35.888 --> 01:14:37.306
Had the money been in there.

1147
01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:39.141
I'd have a different
expression on my face.

1148
01:14:39.141 --> 01:14:40.518
Impossible.

1149
01:14:40.518 --> 01:14:42.603
Takes days to get
into that thing.

1150
01:14:42.603 --> 01:14:46.107
Not if we have the key.
Mrs. Lightstone.

1151
01:14:47.483 --> 01:14:49.527
Thorp.

1152
01:14:50.903 --> 01:14:53.489
You can't trust anyone
these days.

1153
01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:55.658
I'm not sure how. but you

1154
01:14:55.658 --> 01:14:58.536
or one of your shithead kids
moved the money.

1155
01:14:58.536 --> 01:15:00.413
And this upsets me.

1156
01:15:00.413 --> 01:15:02.248
It upsets me

1157
01:15:02.248 --> 01:15:06.252
in a way that makes me want to
just randomly shoot at people.

1158
01:15:07.253 --> 01:15:09.463
Hold on. Just... Sorry.

1159
01:15:09.463 --> 01:15:10.881
- Um...
- What? What?

1160
01:15:10.881 --> 01:15:12.258
Uh. what if you randomly shoot

1161
01:15:12.258 --> 01:15:14.844
the only person
who knows where it is?

1162
01:15:15.845 --> 01:15:18.180
Oh. fuck you people!

1163
01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:54.425
Suck on this.

1164
01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:20.910
I need some feedback. guys.

1165
01:16:22.495 --> 01:16:24.455
Guys. what the hell is going on?

1166
01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:10.876
- What's that?
- Huh?

1167
01:17:49.874 --> 01:17:52.001
Jesus Christ.

1168
01:17:52.751 --> 01:17:55.170
Nope. Just jolly old Saint Nick.

1169
01:18:07.725 --> 01:18:10.477
-Oh. God!
- There you go.

1170
01:18:10.477 --> 01:18:12.187
A little stocking stuffer.

1171
01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:16.567
Where is it?
Fuck. fuck. fuck. fuck.

1172
01:18:16.567 --> 01:18:19.028
Fuck. fuck. fuck.

1173
01:18:19.028 --> 01:18:21.739
- I got to watch.
- Fuck!

1174
01:18:22.865 --> 01:18:25.075
Ho-Ho-Holy shit.

1175
01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:30.080
Gertrude would never
trust anybody

1176
01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:32.541
who wasn't blood
with this kind of info.

1177
01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:34.251
So...

1178
01:18:34.251 --> 01:18:37.880
the in-laws wouldn't know shit.

1179
01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:40.424
which means
that I can shoot her...

1180
01:18:41.967 --> 01:18:43.969
...unless you tell me
where the fucking money is.

1181
01:18:43.969 --> 01:18:46.221
Please don't. okay?
It's Christmas.

1182
01:18:46.221 --> 01:18:48.057
Shut up!

1183
01:18:48.933 --> 01:18:50.351
I swear.
I'll blow her brains out

1184
01:18:50.351 --> 01:18:51.769
unless you tell me
where the money went.

1185
01:18:51.769 --> 01:18:53.979
I did it!

1186
01:18:53.979 --> 01:18:56.398
- What?
- Okay. Yeah. I did it.

1187
01:18:56.398 --> 01:18:58.317
- I moved the money.
- No. d-don't-don't be an idiot.

1188
01:18:58.317 --> 01:19:00.069
- What?
- The money's our only leverage.

1189
01:19:00.069 --> 01:19:01.654
Well. my wife has a fucking
gun to her head. so...

1190
01:19:01.654 --> 01:19:03.739
Yeah. how did you find out
that we were coming. huh?

1191
01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:05.407
I didn't. I was stealing it.

1192
01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:08.035
- Yeah. coincidence.
- Oh. my God.

1193
01:19:08.035 --> 01:19:09.411
I was planning to take the money

1194
01:19:09.411 --> 01:19:12.581
and leave with my wife
and daughter tonight

1195
01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:14.583
and never come back here.

1196
01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:17.962
Oh. and then my mom would. uh.

1197
01:19:17.962 --> 01:19:19.964
read the note with her whiskey
in the morning

1198
01:19:19.964 --> 01:19:21.757
and know what I had done.

1199
01:19:21.757 --> 01:19:24.051
For years.
I have been telling you

1200
01:19:24.051 --> 01:19:26.428
to stop caring about
your mother's fucking money!

1201
01:19:26.428 --> 01:19:29.682
And you think the solution
was to steal a bunch of it.

1202
01:19:30.474 --> 01:19:32.685
Well. it...
yeah. it does sound stupid

1203
01:19:32.685 --> 01:19:34.186
when you say it like that.

1204
01:19:34.186 --> 01:19:36.188
How can you do this right now?

1205
01:19:36.188 --> 01:19:38.273
It's disgusting. After all
that Mother has given us?

1206
01:19:38.273 --> 01:19:40.484
Come on. Alva.
Everything she ever gave you.

1207
01:19:40.484 --> 01:19:41.777
she made damn sure we knew

1208
01:19:41.777 --> 01:19:43.028
she had the power
to take right back.

1209
01:19:43.028 --> 01:19:46.907
I have spent years
groveling to you.

1210
01:19:46.907 --> 01:19:49.702
In the meanwhile.
I was destroying

1211
01:19:49.702 --> 01:19:51.745
the only good thing in my life.

1212
01:19:51.745 --> 01:19:53.122
What are we doing here. huh?

1213
01:19:53.122 --> 01:19:55.749
Family therapy or doing a heist?

1214
01:19:55.749 --> 01:19:59.003
- Yeah. enough of this sharing
bullshit. -

1215
01:19:59.003 --> 01:20:00.963
All right. Where'd you put it?

1216
01:20:07.136 --> 01:20:09.805
Look at this little idiot.

1217
01:20:13.517 --> 01:20:14.893
Oh. no.

1218
01:20:14.893 --> 01:20:16.729
What?

1219
01:20:16.729 --> 01:20:18.647
- The bad guys found me.
- Okay.

1220
01:20:18.647 --> 01:20:20.482
I'm coming.

1221
01:20:27.072 --> 01:20:30.993
You know. booby traps don't work
unless you hide them.

1222
01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:35.164
You little moron.

1223
01:20:38.208 --> 01:20:40.544
- Jesus! Shit!

1224
01:20:44.423 --> 01:20:46.592
Help me! Help me! Help!

1225
01:20:48.010 --> 01:20:50.137
You'll be f...
You'll be fine.

1226
01:20:50.137 --> 01:20:52.306
Sit tight.
I'll be back in a sec.

1227
01:20:55.184 --> 01:20:57.519
Right after I kill
this little piece of shit!

1228
01:21:00.272 --> 01:21:02.691
You little fucking brat.

1229
01:21:51.115 --> 01:21:52.908
You're dead!

1230
01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:55.410
You're so fucking dead!

1231
01:22:02.584 --> 01:22:05.045
Fucking piece of shit.

1232
01:22:10.092 --> 01:22:12.928
You little...

1233
01:22:30.195 --> 01:22:32.239
- Incoming!

1234
01:22:50.966 --> 01:22:52.801
Son of a fucking...

1235
01:23:02.853 --> 01:23:04.813
Fuck.

1236
01:23:04.813 --> 01:23:06.607
I got you now. kid.

1237
01:23:06.607 --> 01:23:08.275
Yeah? Heads up.

1238
01:23:10.402 --> 01:23:12.029
That's all you got?
You fucking...

1239
01:23:14.865 --> 01:23:17.409
Enough of this shit.

1240
01:23:42.976 --> 01:23:44.186
Santa!

1241
01:23:54.112 --> 01:23:56.365
Hi. Trudy. Hi.

1242
01:23:56.365 --> 01:23:59.201
I made booby traps like
in the movie. It was so funny.

1243
01:23:59.201 --> 01:24:01.828
Ho. ho. ho.

1244
01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:11.630
Trudy. I want you to. uh...
just do me a favor.

1245
01:24:12.464 --> 01:24:15.384
Just turn around
and close your eyes.

1246
01:24:15.384 --> 01:24:18.220
Maybe put your fingers
in your ears and. uh.

1247
01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:21.265
sing "Jingle Bells"
as loud as you can.

1248
01:24:27.813 --> 01:24:30.774
You were about to murder
an innocent child.

1249
01:24:32.109 --> 01:24:33.735
Innocent?

1250
01:24:33.735 --> 01:24:35.737
- It's naughty.

1251
01:24:35.737 --> 01:24:37.197
Naughty.

1252
01:24:37.948 --> 01:24:39.408
- Naughty!

1253
01:24:39.408 --> 01:24:41.118
It's part of
the Lightstone legacy.

1254
01:24:41.118 --> 01:24:42.744
We're horrible people.

1255
01:24:42.744 --> 01:24:44.621
So I get why you did
what you did.

1256
01:24:44.621 --> 01:24:46.707
When your grandfather told me
I'd never run the company

1257
01:24:46.707 --> 01:24:49.126
because a girl
doesn't have what it takes.

1258
01:24:49.126 --> 01:24:51.128
I had to snatch the reins
away from him.

1259
01:24:51.128 --> 01:24:52.587
But the point is.

1260
01:24:52.587 --> 01:24:54.339
a Lightstone takes
what's theirs.

1261
01:24:54.339 --> 01:24:56.008
I'm proud of you. son.

1262
01:24:56.008 --> 01:24:57.467
All right. where the hell is it?

1263
01:24:59.803 --> 01:25:01.722
The money's hidden inside.

1264
01:25:02.889 --> 01:25:06.018
And the Three Wise Men
presented him with gifts

1265
01:25:06.018 --> 01:25:08.854
of frankincense. myrrh...

1266
01:25:10.981 --> 01:25:14.067
...and cold hard cash.

1267
01:25:14.067 --> 01:25:15.527
Load it up. boys.

1268
01:25:15.527 --> 01:25:17.779
All right.
we're securing the money.

1269
01:25:17.779 --> 01:25:19.865
Kill the hostages
and meet us outside.

1270
01:25:19.865 --> 01:25:21.658
What?

1271
01:25:21.658 --> 01:25:23.660
No.

1272
01:25:25.454 --> 01:25:26.913
Mom.

1273
01:25:26.913 --> 01:25:28.290
It's fine. Bert.

1274
01:25:28.290 --> 01:25:29.791
Everything's fine.

1275
01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:31.877
Okay.

1276
01:25:31.877 --> 01:25:33.795
Everybody. get up.

1277
01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:38.300
It's time for a murder.

1278
01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:40.886
Come on. Come on.
You don't want to kill us.

1279
01:25:40.886 --> 01:25:42.220
You really don't.

1280
01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:44.389
Oh. yes. I do.

1281
01:25:44.389 --> 01:25:47.476
I really. really. really do.

1282
01:25:47.476 --> 01:25:49.186
And I'm gonna start with you.

1283
01:25:49.186 --> 01:25:50.520
No. no. no. no. no. no. no. no.

1284
01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:51.813
Wait. wait. wait. wait.
wait. wait. wait.

1285
01:25:53.523 --> 01:25:55.233
You got to kill
Aunt Linda first.

1286
01:25:55.233 --> 01:25:56.985
What the hell. Bert?

1287
01:25:56.985 --> 01:25:59.071
You want to squeeze in
being a little shit

1288
01:25:59.071 --> 01:26:00.614
before you die. Bertrude?

1289
01:26:00.614 --> 01:26:02.240
- I say shoot him first.
- What?

1290
01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:04.326
Wait. No. no. no.
Don't shoot him.

1291
01:26:04.326 --> 01:26:06.370
Don't shoot him first.
And don't you call him

1292
01:26:06.370 --> 01:26:08.080
a little shit.
you gold-digging bitch.

1293
01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:09.790
Okay. I changed my mind.

1294
01:26:09.790 --> 01:26:11.750
- Shoot the alcoholic bitch
first. -Don't call my mom

1295
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:13.835
- an alcoholic bitch.
- Your mom's an alcoholic.

1296
01:26:13.835 --> 01:26:15.670
- I'm sorry.
- You're a gold-digging bitch.

1297
01:26:15.670 --> 01:26:17.839
Oh. I'm a gold-digger.
when I have a whole-ass career?

1298
01:26:17.839 --> 01:26:19.508
You're not even part
of the fucking family.

1299
01:26:19.508 --> 01:26:22.260
- She's an engineer.
- You know goddamn well...

1300
01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:23.637
Shut up!

1301
01:26:27.349 --> 01:26:31.436
Just like rats in a barrel.

1302
01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:34.398
Why don't you die
with some dignity?

1303
01:26:39.444 --> 01:26:41.363
Get off of me!

1304
01:26:41.363 --> 01:26:43.115
Okay. okay.

1305
01:26:43.115 --> 01:26:44.366
Fuck you!

1306
01:26:44.366 --> 01:26:46.952
This is for yelling at my child!

1307
01:26:46.952 --> 01:26:48.370
Creep!

1308
01:26:48.370 --> 01:26:49.913
That's for slapping me.
motherfucker!

1309
01:26:49.913 --> 01:26:51.998
This is for
your dumb fucking hat!

1310
01:27:01.633 --> 01:27:03.301
Is he...

1311
01:27:03.301 --> 01:27:04.845
Is he dead?

1312
01:27:08.723 --> 01:27:10.600
Yeah.

1313
01:27:11.393 --> 01:27:13.019
Thanks. Linda.

1314
01:27:13.019 --> 01:27:16.231
Well. it's nice to do something
as a family for a change.

1315
01:27:17.399 --> 01:27:19.109
--Oh. shit!

1316
01:27:19.109 --> 01:27:20.986
I'm gonna...

1317
01:27:25.073 --> 01:27:26.616
That was for Morgan.

1318
01:27:26.616 --> 01:27:31.621
He may have been stupid.
but he was very. very hot.

1319
01:27:32.998 --> 01:27:35.375
Oh. Trudy!

1320
01:27:35.375 --> 01:27:37.794
- Mommy!

1321
01:27:37.794 --> 01:27:39.421
Thank God. baby.

1322
01:27:39.421 --> 01:27:41.339
Are you okay?

1323
01:27:41.339 --> 01:27:43.091
I'm okay. Mommy.

1324
01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:44.259
Okay.

1325
01:27:44.259 --> 01:27:46.761
This is my friend. Santa.

1326
01:27:51.183 --> 01:27:53.268
What the fuck?

1327
01:27:53.268 --> 01:27:55.103
I can't thank you enough.
Mister...

1328
01:27:55.103 --> 01:27:57.439
Claus. But please call me Santa.

1329
01:27:57.439 --> 01:27:58.815
Mm-hmm.

1330
01:27:58.815 --> 01:28:00.942
You guys should get out of here.

1331
01:28:00.942 --> 01:28:02.402
It's dangerous.

1332
01:28:02.402 --> 01:28:04.738
They took my husband
and her grandmother.

1333
01:28:06.573 --> 01:28:08.200
Anybody know how to work
these gizmos?

1334
01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:09.534
I think so.

1335
01:28:09.534 --> 01:28:11.286
I used to hunt with my dad.

1336
01:28:11.286 --> 01:28:12.454
Ow.

1337
01:28:12.454 --> 01:28:14.122
Copy that. How's that looking?

1338
01:28:14.122 --> 01:28:16.958
- Yeah. I got it on lockdown.
- Heads on a swivel. boys.

1339
01:28:18.293 --> 01:28:19.920
- Incoming!
- Heads up!

1340
01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:22.631
- Oh. oh! Who's shooting?

1341
01:28:22.631 --> 01:28:24.299
- Who's...

1342
01:28:24.299 --> 01:28:27.469
- Cap. get down!
- Watch it! Watch it!

1343
01:28:32.557 --> 01:28:34.935
Gun 'em down. Mow them all down.

1344
01:28:50.784 --> 01:28:53.620
- All right. let's get the fuck
out of here. -Let's go.

1345
01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:56.122
- Go where?
- Come on. move. you old bat.

1346
01:28:56.873 --> 01:28:58.833
Get your fucking
hands off of me.

1347
01:29:08.969 --> 01:29:11.304
Oh! Oh. shit.

1348
01:29:11.304 --> 01:29:14.683
My balls! My fucking balls!

1349
01:29:31.324 --> 01:29:34.160
Ow. my balls! Why did you
shoot me in the ball...

1350
01:29:37.998 --> 01:29:40.375
Oh. Jesus.

1351
01:29:40.375 --> 01:29:42.043
Sorry.

1352
01:29:43.878 --> 01:29:46.548
Don't worry about us. Mr. Claus.
We got this.

1353
01:29:46.548 --> 01:29:48.800
Who is that guy?

1354
01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:51.428
He said he was Mr. Claus.

1355
01:29:53.221 --> 01:29:55.265
- Fuck. Trudy.
- No. no.

1356
01:29:55.265 --> 01:29:56.891
She's in the house. She's okay.

1357
01:29:56.891 --> 01:29:58.268
She's safe.

1358
01:29:58.268 --> 01:30:00.395
- Oh. thank God.
- Yeah.

1359
01:30:21.124 --> 01:30:22.584
No. no.

1360
01:30:22.584 --> 01:30:25.253
- Oh... go. go. go. go. go.
- No. no. no. Wait. wait.

1361
01:31:11.091 --> 01:31:13.510
Oh. shit!

1362
01:31:15.762 --> 01:31:18.556
- Ho. ho!

1363
01:31:20.266 --> 01:31:21.476
Fuck!

1364
01:32:05.061 --> 01:32:07.731
- Fucking die.

1365
01:33:00.909 --> 01:33:02.786
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1366
01:33:02.786 --> 01:33:06.080
Yeah. over here. Over here.

1367
01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:07.332
Santa!

1368
01:33:08.291 --> 01:33:10.126
Come on!

1369
01:33:10.126 --> 01:33:11.586
Yeah.

1370
01:33:55.380 --> 01:33:56.631
Fuck.

1371
01:34:20.321 --> 01:34:22.365
You're real?

1372
01:34:23.741 --> 01:34:26.160
You're... him.

1373
01:34:29.163 --> 01:34:30.415
You're you.

1374
01:34:30.415 --> 01:34:33.126
That's what I've been trying
to tell you.

1375
01:34:33.126 --> 01:34:36.504
The real goddamn Santa Claus.

1376
01:34:36.504 --> 01:34:38.965
This is not your night. pal.

1377
01:34:38.965 --> 01:34:42.093
Oh. I don't know.
I think you're wrong.

1378
01:34:42.093 --> 01:34:45.513
I think my whole shitty life's
built up to this moment.

1379
01:34:45.513 --> 01:34:46.890
Because when I kill you.

1380
01:34:46.890 --> 01:34:50.184
this whole goddamn holiday
finally ends.

1381
01:34:51.936 --> 01:34:53.855
Whatever it takes...

1382
01:34:55.607 --> 01:34:57.692
...Christmas dies tonight.

1383
01:35:49.911 --> 01:35:51.579
Whoa!

1384
01:37:16.831 --> 01:37:19.417
The last Christmas.

1385
01:37:29.260 --> 01:37:31.888
Not if you still believe.

1386
01:37:33.681 --> 01:37:35.683
No!

1387
01:38:03.711 --> 01:38:07.381
I have no idea what the fuck
is going on here.

1388
01:38:09.759 --> 01:38:11.886
But this ends now.

1389
01:38:16.808 --> 01:38:18.601
Damn right it does.

1390
01:38:27.777 --> 01:38:29.946
Trudy. be careful.

1391
01:38:33.658 --> 01:38:35.576
Santa!

1392
01:38:35.576 --> 01:38:38.079
Oh. no. Santa.

1393
01:38:39.539 --> 01:38:41.082
Oh. no.

1394
01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:50.049
You saved my daughter.

1395
01:38:50.842 --> 01:38:52.385
No.

1396
01:38:53.177 --> 01:38:54.762
She saved me.

1397
01:38:54.762 --> 01:38:57.515
Help him. Please help him.

1398
01:38:57.515 --> 01:39:00.017
Honey. I don't think
there's anything we can do.

1399
01:39:00.017 --> 01:39:01.269
It's okay. It's okay.

1400
01:39:01.269 --> 01:39:03.604
It's too late for that.

1401
01:39:03.604 --> 01:39:05.940
Too late.

1402
01:39:06.732 --> 01:39:09.402
I'm cold.

1403
01:39:09.402 --> 01:39:11.654
I haven't felt cold in years.

1404
01:39:11.654 --> 01:39:13.698
We need to keep him warm.

1405
01:39:14.532 --> 01:39:16.951
All of the fires are going out.

1406
01:39:16.951 --> 01:39:19.245
We need to find
something to burn.

1407
01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:22.123
I got an idea.

1408
01:39:25.042 --> 01:39:27.003
Whoa.

1409
01:39:28.546 --> 01:39:29.964
No.

1410
01:39:29.964 --> 01:39:32.133
No. no. no. no. No. Jason. no.

1411
01:39:32.133 --> 01:39:33.259
Please. Santa.

1412
01:39:33.259 --> 01:39:36.262
I don't want you to die.

1413
01:39:39.348 --> 01:39:41.058
Jason. let's slow this down.

1414
01:39:41.058 --> 01:39:42.560
What are you doing?

1415
01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:45.855
I've lived longer
than any man should ever live.

1416
01:39:45.855 --> 01:39:48.566
He's pretty much dead.
What the hell is happening?

1417
01:39:48.566 --> 01:39:50.651
- You don't need to burn money.
- Okay. More. Yeah.

1418
01:39:50.651 --> 01:39:54.113
You can't die. Santa.
You have to get up.

1419
01:39:54.113 --> 01:39:56.657
I think I used up
all my Christmas magic.

1420
01:39:57.658 --> 01:39:59.285
Sorry.

1421
01:40:01.329 --> 01:40:05.082
I'm s... I'm sorry I can't
give you what you asked for.

1422
01:40:06.667 --> 01:40:08.961
Take that. Take that.

1423
01:40:08.961 --> 01:40:10.504
But you did.

1424
01:40:13.257 --> 01:40:15.593
Santa. please don't die.

1425
01:40:15.593 --> 01:40:18.137
Wake up. Wake up.

1426
01:40:18.137 --> 01:40:20.806
We need to get him
close to the fire.

1427
01:40:20.806 --> 01:40:22.683
Jason.

1428
01:40:23.434 --> 01:40:25.394
Just wake up.

1429
01:40:26.437 --> 01:40:27.813
Please.

1430
01:40:27.813 --> 01:40:29.690
No.

1431
01:40:34.028 --> 01:40:37.281
Oh. I am so. so sorry.

1432
01:40:42.203 --> 01:40:44.914
- This man...

1433
01:40:45.748 --> 01:40:49.585
This brave. brave man.
whoever he was...

1434
01:40:49.585 --> 01:40:50.878
He's Santa.

1435
01:40:50.878 --> 01:40:53.130
The real Santa. He is.

1436
01:40:53.130 --> 01:40:56.217
And I still believe in him.

1437
01:40:57.051 --> 01:40:59.720
I'll always believe in you.
Santa.

1438
01:41:04.350 --> 01:41:06.310
I believe in him. too.

1439
01:41:09.313 --> 01:41:12.149
He saved Trudy.

1440
01:41:12.149 --> 01:41:14.402
He saved our family.

1441
01:41:16.362 --> 01:41:18.698
What's realer than that?

1442
01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:24.453
Then maybe...

1443
01:41:26.956 --> 01:41:29.083
I believe in him. too.

1444
01:41:29.917 --> 01:41:31.460
So do I.

1445
01:41:32.503 --> 01:41:35.840
Oh. shit.

1446
01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:37.967
I guess...

1447
01:41:37.967 --> 01:41:40.052
I guess I do. too.

1448
01:41:40.052 --> 01:41:41.887
Fuck me.

1449
01:41:41.887 --> 01:41:43.681
I believe. too.

1450
01:41:54.108 --> 01:41:55.651
Oh. my God.

1451
01:41:55.651 --> 01:41:56.819
Santa!

1452
01:42:01.824 --> 01:42:03.367
You...

1453
01:42:05.119 --> 01:42:07.163
You were dead.

1454
01:42:07.955 --> 01:42:10.541
Christmas magic.

1455
01:42:10.541 --> 01:42:13.169
I still don't really
understand...

1456
01:42:13.169 --> 01:42:15.129
how it works.

1457
01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:22.678
Thank you.

1458
01:42:22.678 --> 01:42:24.722
I don't know
how we can ever repay you.

1459
01:42:24.722 --> 01:42:26.891
Well. you brought me back
from the dead.

1460
01:42:26.891 --> 01:42:28.476
so we'll call it even.

1461
01:42:29.643 --> 01:42:30.853
Even?

1462
01:42:30.853 --> 01:42:33.522
We just burned
half a million dollars.

1463
01:42:34.357 --> 01:42:35.983
- Look. Santa!
- Hmm?

1464
01:42:35.983 --> 01:42:37.360
Look who came.

1465
01:42:44.533 --> 01:42:48.079
Now you show up. huh?

1466
01:42:48.079 --> 01:42:49.538
You leave me here to die.

1467
01:42:49.538 --> 01:42:51.791
come back after
all the work's done. huh?

1468
01:42:51.791 --> 01:42:54.543
You know what? I should make
you guys into a stew

1469
01:42:54.543 --> 01:42:56.796
and feed you to the elves!

1470
01:42:58.756 --> 01:43:03.511
Yes. Blitzen!
Yes. I'm talking to you!

1471
01:43:03.511 --> 01:43:05.638
You. too. Prancer.

1472
01:43:11.018 --> 01:43:13.062
You got my sack.

1473
01:43:13.062 --> 01:43:17.358
My spare... You went home
and you got my spare sack?

1474
01:43:19.235 --> 01:43:21.987
Oh. God. I can't stay mad
at you guys.

1475
01:43:21.987 --> 01:43:23.572
I...

1476
01:43:23.572 --> 01:43:27.952
Aw. I can't. I can't.

1477
01:43:27.952 --> 01:43:30.704
Aw.

1478
01:43:31.747 --> 01:43:33.874
Aw.

1479
01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:46.303
Hello. beautiful.

1480
01:43:46.303 --> 01:43:48.222
Skullcrusher!

1481
01:44:01.235 --> 01:44:02.903
Guess this is goodbye.

1482
01:44:02.903 --> 01:44:04.363
I got to go.

1483
01:44:05.239 --> 01:44:07.366
Do you have to?

1484
01:44:10.661 --> 01:44:12.830
It's Christmas Eve.
and there's a lot of...

1485
01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:14.540
boys and girls on the nice list

1486
01:44:14.540 --> 01:44:16.959
that want their presents.
you know?

1487
01:44:19.086 --> 01:44:20.754
Thank you.

1488
01:44:21.755 --> 01:44:23.340
For what?

1489
01:44:23.340 --> 01:44:25.009
For believing in me.

1490
01:44:25.009 --> 01:44:28.345
For reminding me
that Christmas still matters.

1491
01:44:29.930 --> 01:44:32.391
And that I still...

1492
01:44:32.391 --> 01:44:34.768
matter.

1493
01:44:36.312 --> 01:44:38.481
You gave me
my "ho. ho. ho" back.

1494
01:44:48.365 --> 01:44:50.701
All right. Get out of here.

1495
01:44:54.413 --> 01:44:57.333
Merry Christmas!

1496
01:44:59.877 --> 01:45:01.128

01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:16.727
Come on. you beautiful bastards!

1502
01:45:16.727 --> 01:45:20.105
We've got some work to do!

1503
01:45:20.105 --> 01:45:23.150
Hyah!

1504
01:45:23.150 --> 01:45:25.861
Ho. ho. ho!

1505
01:45:25.861 --> 01:45:29.073
