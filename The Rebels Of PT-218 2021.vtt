00:00:15.577 --> 00:00:19.084
September 1943.
after four years of war.

4
00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.482
the entirety of Europe is now
under German domination.

5
00:00:21.814 --> 00:00:25.255
However. with Allied victories
in Stalingrad and El Alamein.

6
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.587
the tide of the war
seems to be turning.

7
00:00:28.722 --> 00:00:30.326
But it will never
turn in full until

8
00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:31.756
the Allied invasion of Europe.

9
00:00:32.297 --> 00:00:34.429
With the French coast
still an impenetrable fortress.

10
00:00:34.464 --> 00:00:37.630
the best way in is the enemy's
soft underbelly. Italy.

11
00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:40.171
Fortunately. the landing
in Sicily means British

12
00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:42.206
and American forces are
now lapping at the heels

13
00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:43.669
of the Axis war machine.

14
00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:46.078
Thus. Operation Avalanche
is born.

15
00:00:46.113 --> 00:00:48.806
On September 9th. 1943.
the Allies will attempt to land

16
00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:50.676
in the back door
of the Nazi empire

17
00:00:50.711 --> 00:00:52.447
along the coast of
Italy at Salerno.

18
00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:55.318
To punch a hole in the door
means first clearing

19
00:00:55.353 --> 00:00:57.782
the enemy waters of the deadly
U-Boats and coastal guns.

20
00:00:57.817 --> 00:01:00.389
For that. the Navy will
rely on its smallest

21
00:01:00.424 --> 00:01:03.095
and swiftest vessel.
patrol torpedo boat.

22
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.723
also known as the PT.

23
00:01:05.726 --> 00:01:08.100
While the Allied fleet moves
across the Tyrrhenian Sea.

24
00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:10.234
the only defense for
the PTs are a single ship

25
00:01:10.269 --> 00:01:11.697
of the Merchant Marines.

26
00:01:12.337 --> 00:01:15.701
Comprised of civilian and Navy
personnel U.S. Merchant Marine

27
00:01:15.736 --> 00:01:18.242
fights for the supply and
the men of the U.S. Armed Forces

28
00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:19.837
with all the resources
they'll need.

29
00:01:20.543 --> 00:01:22.609
Tonight the fight.
no less important than

30
00:01:22.644 --> 00:01:24.380
the liberation of
the free world.

31
00:01:24.415 --> 00:01:26.613
will rest in the hands
of that lone vessel.

32
00:01:26.648 --> 00:01:29.220
the S.S. Lawton B. Evans
and her brave crew aboard.

33
00:01:29.717 --> 00:01:32.223
This is our story.

34
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.342
That's that German barge
Irish warned us about.

35
00:01:52.773 --> 00:01:54.542
We got bigger guns.
Should we go in?

36
00:01:54.577 --> 00:01:56.841
Not our job. Buck.
It's a Liberty ship.

37
00:01:56.876 --> 00:01:58.810
We can deliver 10 tons
of K-ration.

38
00:01:58.845 --> 00:02:00.713
lumber and cotton
blankets to Palermo.

39
00:02:00.748 --> 00:02:03.122
Let the warships
take care of the war.

40
00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:05.784
General quarters.

41
00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:07.357
General quarters.

42
00:02:08.492 --> 00:02:09.821

F-Lighter on target!

46
00:02:45.628 --> 00:02:47.298
We're on target. on target.

47
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:51.203
Looks like he's going
to fire the torpedoes.

48
00:02:51.766 --> 00:02:53.568
Those F-Lighters are tough.

49
00:02:53.603 --> 00:02:55.966
but nothing a couple of fish
can't take down real fast.

50
00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:59.442
Okay. man.
prepare the torpedoes.

51
00:03:05.615 --> 00:03:07.450
Starboard torpedo!

52
00:03:07.881 --> 00:03:08.913

Portside torpedo!

54
00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:14.424
Fire!

55
00:03:15.823 --> 00:03:17.724
Come on.

56
00:03:25.701 --> 00:03:27.701
Yes!

57
00:03:27.736 --> 00:03:29.802
There she goes.

Direct hit!

59
00:03:31.641 --> 00:03:33.410
Good work. men.

60
00:03:33.445 --> 00:03:35.214
Direct hit. direct hit.

61
00:03:35.612 --> 00:03:37.480
Got him!
Took about time!

62
00:03:37.515 --> 00:03:38.679
Did you see that. Tommy?

63
00:03:38.714 --> 00:03:40.945
I saw it.
Beautiful. beautiful!

64
00:03:41.618 --> 00:03:42.749
Couldn't have done
better myself.

65
00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:49.987
Four marks.

66
00:03:50.022 --> 00:03:51.362
They got eyes on us!

67
00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:54.233
Shit.

68
00:04:00.736 --> 00:04:01.966
It's a coastal battery!

00:04:02.837 --> 00:04:05.244

Hard right rudder. 10 degrees!

73
00:04:09.613 --> 00:04:10.942
Avoid fire!

00:04:37.542 --> 00:04:39.773
We're gonna lose that PT
if we don't do something now.

82
00:04:40.347 --> 00:04:41.973
Get ready!
Get loaded!

Damn it!

92
00:05:17.681 --> 00:05:19.351
We gotta take out those guns!

93
00:05:19.386 --> 00:05:20.583
It's no use. Skip.

94
00:05:21.852 --> 00:05:23.652
I didn't start this fight. but
I'm damn well gonna finish it.

Go check the boilers
for damage!

How is it?

113
00:06:31.887 --> 00:06:33.920
Can't take another one
of those. Skipper.

114
00:06:34.923 --> 00:06:36.560

for another pass.

Get us the hell
outta here. helmsman.

118
00:06:50.807 --> 00:06:52.411
Aye. aye. sir.

119
00:07:34.719 --> 00:07:35.817
Let's pick it up. boys!

120
00:07:36.083 --> 00:07:37.786
Wanna finish this detail
before Christmas!

121
00:07:37.821 --> 00:07:39.216
I don't see you helping.

122
00:07:39.251 --> 00:07:41.152
Ah. you're working like
you play chess. Moose.

123
00:07:41.187 --> 00:07:42.219
Let's pick it up.

124
00:07:44.861 --> 00:07:46.993
Think we're taking this baby
all the way to Berlin?

125
00:07:47.897 --> 00:07:50.128
That's not how
depth charges work. Bauer.

126
00:07:52.099 --> 00:07:53.505
All right. ladies.

127
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.474
You got five minutes.
let's pick it up!

128
00:08:07.147 --> 00:08:08.751
Couple of dents
that could use hammering.

129
00:08:09.215 --> 00:08:11.281
Otherwise. she held up okay.

130
00:08:11.316 --> 00:08:12.821
This isn't what I had in mind.

131
00:08:12.856 --> 00:08:14.658
Redeker. I didn't sign up
to get shot at.

132
00:08:14.693 --> 00:08:15.890
Krauts ruin everything.

133
00:08:15.925 --> 00:08:17.793
This isn't the Navy!
We're Merchant Marines!

134
00:08:17.828 --> 00:08:19.795
Well. you'd think the Germans
would grant us a deferment.

135
00:08:20.292 --> 00:08:21.764
All those guardboys topside?

136
00:08:22.162 --> 00:08:24.195
They're the ones trained
for this nonsense!

137
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:25.834
I'm just here to keep
this baby afloat.

138
00:08:25.869 --> 00:08:28.133
Look. it's all
a matter of luck.

139
00:08:28.773 --> 00:08:31.004
When was the last time you were
back home in Mill Valley?

140
00:08:31.303 --> 00:08:33.710
Let's see. 1941?

141
00:08:33.745 --> 00:08:35.239
Oh. I've been home since then.

142
00:08:35.274 --> 00:08:37.945
And I'll tell you.
you wouldn't like it.

143
00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:39.749
You liar.

144
00:08:39.784 --> 00:08:41.850
You got the prettiest little
family I've ever seen.

145
00:08:41.885 --> 00:08:45.656
That's what I'm saying!
I am fabulously lucky!

146
00:08:45.691 --> 00:08:48.252
You. on the other hand.
not so much.

147
00:08:49.992 --> 00:08:52.025
Look. it's like poker.

148
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.864
Out here. you're a respected
sailor with a full house.

149
00:08:55.899 --> 00:08:58.966
Back home. you maybe
got a pair of sixes.

150
00:08:59.001 --> 00:09:02.805
At sea. you ain't never
getting these aces. kid.

151
00:09:04.611 --> 00:09:06.578
Are you trying
to make me feel better?

152
00:09:07.372 --> 00:09:08.778
Not really.

153
00:09:09.616 --> 00:09:11.077
Mission accomplished. chief.

154
00:09:11.112 --> 00:09:13.145
Hey. I'm always here for you.

155
00:09:13.686 --> 00:09:15.554
I'm like the ship therapist.

156
00:09:15.952 --> 00:09:17.556
I'm gonna start
charging you guys.

157
00:09:22.156 --> 00:09:23.320
[explosions]

158
00:09:23.355 --> 00:09:25.597
I heard things got a
little hairy out there.

159
00:09:25.632 --> 00:09:27.764
How's things on Lawton B. Evans?

160
00:09:27.799 --> 00:09:31.097
Our last escort was destroyed
and we barely escaped alive.

161
00:09:31.132 --> 00:09:32.901
But the ship took
the brunt of it.

162
00:09:32.936 --> 00:09:34.364
We're leaking oil like a sieve

163
00:09:34.399 --> 00:09:36.740
and we'll be vulnerable
until we can repair it.

164
00:09:36.775 --> 00:09:37.807
Sounds like it was hell.

165
00:09:37.842 --> 00:09:39.842
I misjudged the situation. sir.

166
00:09:39.877 --> 00:09:41.076
Oh. bullshit!

167
00:09:41.112 --> 00:09:43.978
The Jerrys have that entire
coastline armed to the teeth.

168
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:45.342
They been
interrupting our movements

169
00:09:45.377 --> 00:09:46.717
in that sector for weeks.

170
00:09:47.115 --> 00:09:48.246
It's only a matter of time

171
00:09:48.281 --> 00:09:49.885
'til you came upon
a coastal battery.

172
00:09:50.855 --> 00:09:53.284
Now listen. Snow.
I know you had a bit of bad luck

173
00:09:53.319 --> 00:09:54.384
back in Tunisia. but...

174
00:09:54.419 --> 00:09:55.858
I wasn't cut out
for convoys. sir.

175
00:09:55.893 --> 00:09:56.892
I was trained to fight.

176
00:09:56.928 --> 00:09:59.092
Yeah. well. those
fighting instincts of yours

177
00:09:59.127 --> 00:10:00.830
almost cost a thousand men
their lives.

178
00:10:01.668 --> 00:10:03.866
I take full responsibility
for my actions. sir.

179
00:10:03.901 --> 00:10:05.296
I alone am to blame.

180
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.265
That's why I'm gonna give
you a shot at redemption.

181
00:10:08.103 --> 00:10:09.102
Sir?

182
00:10:10.271 --> 00:10:12.677
Landing troops on Salerno Beach
in less than 48 hours.

183
00:10:13.273 --> 00:10:14.646
The invasion of Europe?

184
00:10:14.681 --> 00:10:15.944
Commander?

185
00:10:18.784 --> 00:10:20.652
This is Major General Bradley.

186
00:10:20.687 --> 00:10:21.851
General?

187
00:10:22.282 --> 00:10:23.886
Listen. We're looking
to stick it to Hitler

188
00:10:23.921 --> 00:10:25.283
by taking out
his buddy. Mussolini.

189
00:10:25.318 --> 00:10:26.284
That sound good to you?

190
00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.893
Great. sir!

191
00:10:28.928 --> 00:10:31.696
Great. You might have noticed
the coast around Salerno

192
00:10:31.731 --> 00:10:34.259
is heavily armed with
a battery of SS88s.

193
00:10:34.294 --> 00:10:35.425
the toughest gun in their army.

194
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:36.635
Yes. sir.

195
00:10:37.604 --> 00:10:39.396
We're sending in
two PT boats with commandos

196
00:10:39.431 --> 00:10:41.937
to take out those guns.

197
00:10:41.972 --> 00:10:43.103
We're gonna need your men
to provide

198
00:10:43.138 --> 00:10:44.742
artillery support as needed.

199
00:10:45.712 --> 00:10:47.140
The Lawton B. Evans. General?

200
00:10:47.175 --> 00:10:48.207
That's right.

201
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:51.716
The Krauts are looking to get
a foothold back in Italy.

202
00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:54.015
Fact is. your little cargo ship

203
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.919
is the most powerful vessel
that we have in that sector.

204
00:10:56.954 --> 00:10:58.756
I won't let you down. General.

205
00:11:00.023 --> 00:11:01.319
You're damn right. you won't.

206
00:11:02.157 --> 00:11:04.091
This is gonna be the single
most important mission

207
00:11:04.126 --> 00:11:06.995
that you and your men on the
S.S. Evans have ever conducted.

208
00:11:07.833 --> 00:11:09.294
Thousands of lives
depend on it.

209
00:11:09.329 --> 00:11:10.328
Understood. sir!

210
00:11:10.803 --> 00:11:12.297
You got 36 hours to get
in there

211
00:11:12.332 --> 00:11:14.673
and knock out all the
enemy vessels before daybreak

212
00:11:15.038 --> 00:11:17.203
or the invasion of Salerno
will be in jeopardy.

213
00:11:17.238 --> 00:11:18.303
Understood?

214
00:11:18.338 --> 00:11:19.744
Yes. sir!

215
00:11:20.945 --> 00:11:22.076
Commander?

216
00:11:24.311 --> 00:11:29.149
Listen. Lieutenant. I know this
is a dangerous mission. but...

217
00:11:29.184 --> 00:11:30.887
I am honored to be chosen
for this duty. sir.

218
00:11:30.922 --> 00:11:33.450
All I can think about
is getting back in the fight.

219
00:11:35.091 --> 00:11:37.454
Well. I guess we wouldn't
want it any other way. would we?

220
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.225
Barnes out.

221
00:11:40.096 --> 00:11:41.865
0600. we're outta here.

222
00:11:43.836 --> 00:11:45.066
Italy.

223
00:11:57.014 --> 00:11:58.244
Hey. hey.

224
00:11:59.786 --> 00:12:01.214
All right. all right. all right.

225
00:12:01.513 --> 00:12:02.721
Chorizo.

226
00:12:04.791 --> 00:12:07.121
Orozco. could we have
some eggs with Spam?

227
00:12:07.156 --> 00:12:09.354
Mr. Ford!
I been looking for you!

228
00:12:09.389 --> 00:12:11.092
Yeah. what do you got?

229
00:12:11.127 --> 00:12:13.259
Well. you know how
we were out of bacon.

230
00:12:13.294 --> 00:12:14.392
You got bacon.

231
00:12:14.867 --> 00:12:16.394
I got something
better than bacon.

232
00:12:16.429 --> 00:12:17.802
I got chorizo.

233
00:12:18.332 --> 00:12:19.364
Never heard of it.

234
00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:21.432
You'll love it.

235
00:12:21.467 --> 00:12:23.467
I don't care about protein.
You know what I want.

236
00:12:24.107 --> 00:12:26.239
Yeah. I know what you want.

237
00:12:27.407 --> 00:12:29.374
I knew you'd come through!

238
00:12:30.047 --> 00:12:31.376
What do I owe you?

239
00:12:31.411 --> 00:12:33.950
Hey. just your friendship.
homes...

240
00:12:34.282 --> 00:12:36.249
Oh. and $10.

241
00:12:36.823 --> 00:12:38.251
Deal.

242
00:12:38.286 --> 00:12:40.121
Hey. Orozco.

243
00:12:40.156 --> 00:12:41.485
When you gonna shave
that moustache?

244
00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.421
When Hitler shaves his.

245
00:12:46.558 --> 00:12:47.832
[whistles]

246
00:12:47.867 --> 00:12:49.394
Hey! Come get your eggs!

247
00:12:51.299 --> 00:12:52.364
Come on. Moosie.

248
00:12:52.971 --> 00:12:55.136
Before Snider
does some more sit-ups?

249
00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:01.175
Uh...

250
00:13:08.349 --> 00:13:09.414
Would y'all quit it?

251
00:13:09.449 --> 00:13:11.020
You're giving me
performance anxiety.

252
00:13:11.055 --> 00:13:12.923
[laughing]

253
00:13:17.193 --> 00:13:18.456
Are you sure you wanna do that?

254
00:13:20.592 --> 00:13:21.899
Yeah. why not?

255
00:13:21.934 --> 00:13:23.065
Because.

256
00:13:23.903 --> 00:13:25.001
Go ahead.

257
00:13:25.036 --> 00:13:26.068
What?

258
00:13:26.103 --> 00:13:27.234
Nothing.

259
00:13:27.907 --> 00:13:29.137
Just tell me
what I'm doing wrong.

260
00:13:29.172 --> 00:13:30.468
Hey. you're gonna do it anyway.

261
00:13:30.503 --> 00:13:32.140
No. I'm not.
You're doing great.

262
00:13:32.175 --> 00:13:33.174
Don't listen to me.

263
00:13:33.913 --> 00:13:35.814
-You sure?
-Promise.

264
00:13:42.449 --> 00:13:44.383
You know. the funny thing
about chess is

265
00:13:44.418 --> 00:13:47.386
if you do the best move too
early. it's a wasted move.

266
00:13:47.421 --> 00:13:48.926
That's right.

267
00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:50.895
You gotta save the piece
with the most potential.

268
00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:53.326
which in this case. is the queen

269
00:13:54.428 --> 00:13:56.197
until you've exhausted
all the other options.

270
00:14:07.243 --> 00:14:08.946
Come on. Moose.
This year.

271
00:14:19.387 --> 00:14:20.551
Aw!

272
00:14:22.258 --> 00:14:23.488
For crying out loud.

273
00:14:23.523 --> 00:14:24.422
You know what?
Put a shirt on!

274
00:14:24.458 --> 00:14:26.293
You're already making
me feel like crap!

275
00:14:26.999 --> 00:14:28.999
I gotta stop betting
on you. Moose.

276
00:14:29.034 --> 00:14:30.869
Be the butt of
the prank.

277
00:14:43.378 --> 00:14:46.181
Come on. fishy. fishy.
Come on.

278
00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.219
Bauer!

279
00:14:51.254 --> 00:14:53.892
You think you're gonna catch a
German U-boat with this thing?

280
00:14:54.554 --> 00:14:55.894
It'd make quite a trophy.

281
00:14:56.259 --> 00:14:58.292
Ensign!
I got Barnes calling for you!

282
00:14:59.031 --> 00:15:00.030
Yeah. it would.

283
00:15:11.109 --> 00:15:12.141
Commander?

284
00:15:12.176 --> 00:15:13.439
Ensign Ford?

285
00:15:13.705 --> 00:15:15.177
Yes. sir?

286
00:15:16.411 --> 00:15:20.578
I have a very important
and rather unique request.

287
00:15:21.251 --> 00:15:22.954
I'd very much appreciate it
that you'd keep it

288
00:15:22.989 --> 00:15:23.955
between the two of us.

289
00:15:25.519 --> 00:15:26.584
Of course. sir.

290
00:15:27.787 --> 00:15:30.687
I want you to keep an eye on
our friend. Lieutenant Snow.

291
00:15:33.593 --> 00:15:35.659
I don't understand. Commander.

292
00:15:37.003 --> 00:15:39.597
I know Snow is a great fighter.

293
00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:41.698
I've known that ever
since he and I met

294
00:15:41.733 --> 00:15:43.942
on the battlefield
back in Tunisia.

295
00:15:44.604 --> 00:15:45.735
Toughest in the Navy. sir.

296
00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:47.638
But this is not
the Navy. Ensign.

297
00:15:47.673 --> 00:15:49.079
this is the Merchant Marine.

298
00:15:49.609 --> 00:15:51.411
You've got a fine capable crew.

299
00:15:52.216 --> 00:15:54.315
But you and I both know
that those boys have

300
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:57.153
neither the discipline
or the training

301
00:15:57.188 --> 00:15:59.089
to go against those
Germans on their own.

302
00:16:00.191 --> 00:16:02.257
And that's just the fight
that he's looking for. sir.

303
00:16:02.292 --> 00:16:04.655
Which is exactly why
I need you to make sure

304
00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:06.756
that he does not jump
out of his frigging boots

305
00:16:06.791 --> 00:16:08.329
at the first smell of combat.

306
00:16:09.134 --> 00:16:10.661
I'd rather not
challenge the lieutenant

307
00:16:10.696 --> 00:16:12.069
in front of the men. sir.

308
00:16:12.104 --> 00:16:14.071
I'm not asking you
to challenge him.

309
00:16:15.338 --> 00:16:16.700
Just be straight with him. Ford.

310
00:16:16.735 --> 00:16:18.240
He'll listen to you.

311
00:16:18.737 --> 00:16:21.243
If there's any problem.
I've got your back on this.

312
00:16:23.247 --> 00:16:24.246
Understood.
Thank you. sir.

313
00:16:25.349 --> 00:16:27.546
And you'll be off the shore
of Salerno in 34 hours.

314
00:16:27.581 --> 00:16:30.648
That gives you 12 hours until
the invasion fleet arrives.

315
00:16:31.387 --> 00:16:33.387
We cannot allow any
diversions to get in the way

316
00:16:33.422 --> 00:16:34.751
of landing on Italy.

317
00:16:35.457 --> 00:16:37.028
Are we clear on this?

318
00:16:37.393 --> 00:16:39.096
Understood.
I will do my best. sir.

319
00:16:39.362 --> 00:16:40.625
That's all I ask.

320
00:16:44.268 --> 00:16:45.333
Ensign out. sir.

321
00:16:58.513 --> 00:16:59.545
Skip?

322
00:17:00.845 --> 00:17:02.317
Irish says by tomorrow.

323
00:17:02.352 --> 00:17:04.220
visibility should
be close to nil.

324
00:17:04.255 --> 00:17:05.287
I heard.

325
00:17:06.587 --> 00:17:08.092
Well. you think that's
gonna interfere with us

326
00:17:08.127 --> 00:17:09.225
taking out those 88s?

327
00:17:10.428 --> 00:17:13.097
They're not gonna call the
invasion just 'cause it's foggy.

328
00:17:15.299 --> 00:17:17.134
Fancy a snort?

329
00:17:17.565 --> 00:17:19.532
Only if you can figure out
a way to get this bucket

330
00:17:19.567 --> 00:17:22.403
to the Italian coast
without it falling apart.

331
00:17:22.735 --> 00:17:24.636
You know we're at the goddamn
mercy of this war. Bill.

332
00:17:24.671 --> 00:17:26.770
Spare me.

333
00:17:27.311 --> 00:17:28.805
You've seen the battle maps.

334
00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.609
All of us are just pins
on a piece of paper

335
00:17:30.644 --> 00:17:31.877
the admirals stick in there.

336
00:17:31.912 --> 00:17:34.151
At the end of the day. both of
us are just trying to survive.

337
00:17:34.417 --> 00:17:36.351
And not be that pin
thrown in the trash.

338
00:17:37.783 --> 00:17:40.586
I lost my buddy
because I failed to do my job.

339
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:45.327
Doug died because he was picked
off by a German U-boat.

340
00:17:45.725 --> 00:17:49.265
I abandoned my convoy
chasing shadows. pal.

341
00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:50.533
You saw a chance.

342
00:17:50.568 --> 00:17:52.829
You had an opportunity to take
out a pack of German U-boats.

343
00:17:52.864 --> 00:17:55.106
If I were in your position.
I'd have done the same thing.

344
00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.637
Excuse me. Mr. Snow?

345
00:17:58.672 --> 00:17:59.770
Yeah?

346
00:17:59.805 --> 00:18:01.574
I got a reading a mile east.

347
00:18:02.214 --> 00:18:03.213
What do you figure?

348
00:18:03.479 --> 00:18:05.479
It's pretty big.
Could be a U-boat.

349
00:18:06.383 --> 00:18:07.382
Thanks. Irish.

350
00:18:08.651 --> 00:18:11.353
If we steer clear north a couple
of miles. we should avoid it.

351
00:18:12.455 --> 00:18:13.619
Let's bag it.

352
00:18:15.326 --> 00:18:17.161
Jesus. Bill!
It's a U-boat!

353
00:18:17.196 --> 00:18:18.426
We should steer clear.

354
00:18:18.461 --> 00:18:19.727
This is my command. damn it.

355
00:18:19.763 --> 00:18:22.562
If we can catch that sub on the
surface. we can take her out.

356
00:18:22.597 --> 00:18:23.761
I say let's do it.

357
00:18:25.567 --> 00:18:26.599
Yes. sir.

358
00:18:27.835 --> 00:18:30.240
Tell the men to man the guns
and prepare the depth charges.

359
00:18:30.275 --> 00:18:32.110
The moon's not gonna rise
for a couple of hours.

360
00:18:33.509 --> 00:18:35.245
The bastards
will never see us coming.

361
00:18:36.479 --> 00:18:38.116
Aye aye. Skip.

362
00:18:43.948 --> 00:18:46.223
General quarters.
General quarters.

363
00:18:46.258 --> 00:18:47.785
All men. man your
battle stations.

364
00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.556
General quarters.
General quarters.

365
00:18:49.591 --> 00:18:51.492
All men. man your
battle stations.

366
00:18:52.264 --> 00:18:54.462
General quarters.
General quarters.

367
00:18:54.497 --> 00:18:56.200
All men. man your
battle stations.

368
00:18:56.235 --> 00:18:57.828
General quarters.
General quarters.

369
00:18:57.863 --> 00:18:59.731
All men. man
your battle stations!

370
00:18:59.766 --> 00:19:01.502
General quarters. guys.

371
00:19:02.934 --> 00:19:05.176
General quarters.

372
00:19:33.965 --> 00:19:35.305
How's she looking. Irish?

373
00:19:36.275 --> 00:19:37.571
I think we got the drop
on him. Lieutenant.

374
00:19:37.837 --> 00:19:40.673
Should be 2:00. 800 yards out.

375
00:19:40.708 --> 00:19:42.675
Say it!
He shoulda won MVP. is all!

376
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:45.381
Well. he didn't. so you know!
Who cares?

377
00:19:45.416 --> 00:19:46.448
Does that matter?

378
00:19:47.684 --> 00:19:49.451
Do you always blindly accept
the judgment of your betters?

379
00:19:49.486 --> 00:19:51.519
That. and the Yankees
won the World Series

380
00:19:51.554 --> 00:19:53.851
while the Red Sox finished what?
20 games back?

381
00:19:53.886 --> 00:19:55.688
And that's Ted Williams' fault?

382
00:19:55.723 --> 00:19:58.493
It's called MVP.
Most Valuable Player.

383
00:19:58.528 --> 00:20:00.693
How valuable can Ted Williams
be if the Red Sox

384
00:20:00.728 --> 00:20:01.892
can't win the Pennant?

385
00:20:01.927 --> 00:20:03.729
I'm disgusted. my friend.

386
00:20:03.764 --> 00:20:05.995
that you could be so cavalier
when it comes to the injustice

387
00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:07.502
delivered by the hands of
the Baseball Writers'

388
00:20:07.537 --> 00:20:08.899
Association of America!

389
00:20:08.934 --> 00:20:10.439
I think Robert Feller
should have won.

390
00:20:10.474 --> 00:20:11.506
What?

391
00:20:11.541 --> 00:20:12.573
He had more strikeouts.

392
00:20:12.608 --> 00:20:14.311
Feller? You're an idiot!

393
00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:16.346
Don't you have work to do?

394
00:20:16.381 --> 00:20:17.743
Come on!
I'm not even half-cocked.

395
00:20:17.778 --> 00:20:18.810
Let's get loaded!

396
00:20:18.845 --> 00:20:20.317
-Reload. Jeffries!!
-Loading!

397
00:20:23.817 --> 00:20:25.619
I confirm that U-boat. 2:00.

398
00:20:35.565 --> 00:20:36.894
Shall we blast him
with a five-inch?

399
00:20:36.929 --> 00:20:39.897
Not yet.
I want to get a little closer.

400
00:20:40.438 --> 00:20:42.306
Is that really necessary?

401
00:20:42.341 --> 00:20:43.835
If you want
a confirmed hit. it is.

402
00:20:47.379 --> 00:20:48.906
I wanna sink that bastard.

403
00:20:50.448 --> 00:20:51.909
Yeah. but the closer
we get to them.

404
00:20:51.944 --> 00:20:53.383
the better chance the Germans
gonna see us

405
00:20:53.418 --> 00:20:55.385
and those U-boats have 88mm.

406
00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.617
And I've had a taste of 'em

407
00:20:56.652 --> 00:20:58.322
and I'm not really up
for another one!

408
00:20:58.357 --> 00:20:59.785
Or we can miss and
end up with nothing.

409
00:21:00.656 --> 00:21:02.689
We've got the best gunners
in the Mediterranean.

410
00:21:02.724 --> 00:21:04.493
They can hit an ice cream truck
from this distance!

411
00:21:04.528 --> 00:21:05.725
If you don't like it.
get your own command.

412
00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:06.792
We're goin' in.

413
00:21:07.399 --> 00:21:08.926
-Take her slow ahead.
-Swell.

414
00:21:08.961 --> 00:21:09.993
Aye. aye.
Slow ahead.

415
00:21:32.017 --> 00:21:33.720
300 yards. Skipper.

416
00:21:33.755 --> 00:21:35.887
I need 12 degrees to starboard!

417
00:21:35.922 --> 00:21:37.691
12 degrees to starboard!

418
00:21:38.397 --> 00:21:39.429
200 yards. Skipper!

419
00:21:41.532 --> 00:21:42.729
Five-inch. lock and load.

420
00:21:43.831 --> 00:21:44.995
Five-inch. lock and load!

421
00:21:51.707 --> 00:21:53.938
Grovener. I'm lined up
and I'm ready to kill it!

422
00:21:55.414 --> 00:21:56.743
Snow. we're locked and loaded!

423
00:21:56.778 --> 00:21:57.942
On target!

424
00:21:58.582 --> 00:21:59.647
Fire when ready.

425
00:21:59.682 --> 00:22:02.650
Five-inch fire!
Repeat. five-inch fire!

426
00:22:02.685 --> 00:22:05.587
-Fire at will!
-Fire!

427
00:22:13.729 --> 00:22:14.992
[gunfire]

428
00:22:17.997 --> 00:22:19.370
[shouts]

429
00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:25.673
Take cover!

430
00:22:26.478 --> 00:22:27.972
Hard right rudder.
full throttle!

431
00:22:28.007 --> 00:22:29.875
Hard right
rudder. full throttle!

432
00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:31.074
Give 'em hell. boys!

433
00:22:31.109 --> 00:22:32.614
[phone rings]

434
00:22:36.081 --> 00:22:37.850
Hard right rudder.

435
00:22:37.885 --> 00:22:39.489
Hard right

[gunfire]

437
00:22:51.503 --> 00:22:52.667
Where'd it go?

438
00:22:52.702 --> 00:22:53.734
I don't see it!

439
00:22:53.769 --> 00:22:54.966
You see it. Grovener?

440
00:22:55.001 --> 00:22:56.869
No. not from me!
What about you. Jeffries?

441
00:22:56.904 --> 00:22:58.970
-Nothing over here!
-Who's got the binoculars?

442
00:22:59.005 --> 00:23:00.037
Eyes on the horizon!

443
00:23:07.211 --> 00:23:08.518
He's out of sight.

444
00:23:08.553 --> 00:23:09.651
Yeah. give me those.

445
00:23:11.655 --> 00:23:13.391
He is not getting away.

446
00:23:18.123 --> 00:23:19.793
Prepare depth charges starboard.

447
00:23:20.796 --> 00:23:23.060
Aye. aye. Prepare depth
charges. starboard!

448
00:23:23.601 --> 00:23:25.667
-Depth charge. Jeffries!
-On it!

449
00:23:26.131 --> 00:23:28.164
Get the lead out. Jeffries!
Come on!

450
00:23:28.936 --> 00:23:31.541
-Release depth charges!
-Release depth charges!

451
00:23:51.662 --> 00:23:52.661
Ah!

452
00:23:53.224 --> 00:23:54.960
Any sign of that sub?

453
00:23:55.567 --> 00:23:56.566
Not on the surface. Skip.

454
00:23:57.932 --> 00:23:59.503
Another 200 yards should do it.

455
00:24:00.066 --> 00:24:01.230
We need to disengage.

456
00:24:01.265 --> 00:24:02.770
Not a chance!

457
00:24:03.575 --> 00:24:04.574
Without the element of surprise.

458
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:07.038
a Liberty ship is not gonna
do any good against a U-boat!

459
00:24:08.007 --> 00:24:10.107
We've got more guns.
we've got bigger guns.

460
00:24:10.142 --> 00:24:11.141
Simple.

461
00:24:11.177 --> 00:24:13.583
It's not gonna matter if
we can't see the enemy!

462
00:24:13.618 --> 00:24:17.015
Do I need to remind you who's
commanding this ship. Ensign?

463
00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:18.082
No. sir.

464
00:24:19.888 --> 00:24:20.887
Dead slow ahead.

465
00:24:21.527 --> 00:24:22.988
Aye. aye. dead slow ahead!

466
00:24:23.859 --> 00:24:25.562
Slow ahead!

467
00:24:25.597 --> 00:24:26.959
Aye. aye.

468
00:24:30.536 --> 00:24:31.733
Where is it?

469
00:24:33.132 --> 00:24:34.703
Anyone got eyes on it?

470
00:24:35.002 --> 00:24:36.034
No. sir.

471
00:24:36.069 --> 00:24:37.706
Come on. baby. come on.

472
00:24:43.208 --> 00:24:45.109
Hell. that sub
could be anywhere.

473
00:24:45.683 --> 00:24:46.749
He's beneath us.

474
00:24:46.784 --> 00:24:49.883
U-boats can't go faster
than three knots submerged.

475
00:24:50.688 --> 00:24:51.885
If we can't knock him out.

476
00:24:52.591 --> 00:24:54.217
at least you can give
him a wakeup call.

477
00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:56.758
Drop depth charges!

478
00:24:56.793 --> 00:24:57.990
Depth charges portside.

479
00:24:58.025 --> 00:24:59.893
Depth charges portside!

480
00:24:59.928 --> 00:25:02.060
Repeat!
Depth charges portside!

481
00:25:19.244 --> 00:25:21.519
Torpedo! Torpedo!

482
00:25:21.818 --> 00:25:23.653
Torpedo! Portside!

483
00:25:23.688 --> 00:25:24.984

484
00:25:28.792 --> 00:25:30.660
Let's get some distance!

00:25:30.695 --> 00:25:32.596
Flank speed. 10 degrees right!

486
00:25:32.631 --> 00:25:34.664
Aye. aye. flank speed.
10 degrees right!

487
00:25:38.065 --> 00:25:39.867
Hard left!
We're turning around.

488
00:25:39.902 --> 00:25:41.066
Aye. aye!
Hard left!

489
00:25:45.776 --> 00:25:46.808
There! There he is!

490
00:25:46.843 --> 00:25:47.809
I see him!

491
00:25:52.343 --> 00:25:55.245
Hey. Skip! I got two Krauts
about to man that deck gun!

492
00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:57.247
Take 'em out! Do you want me
to hold your hand?

493
00:25:57.887 --> 00:25:58.886
Yes. sir!

495
00:26:05.356 --> 00:26:07.323
We've got maybe 30 seconds
before they unload those guns.

496
00:26:08.293 --> 00:26:10.293
Get closer.
Await orders.

497
00:26:10.966 --> 00:26:11.965
But sir...

What'd I say about
those deck guns. Bauer?

503
00:26:29.787 --> 00:26:31.050
I'm getting my bearings.

504
00:26:31.085 --> 00:26:32.722
Get your bearings faster!

506
00:26:39.126 --> 00:26:41.093
Oh. Christ!
Jeffries is shot!

507
00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:44.261
Come on. buddy!

508
00:26:44.296 --> 00:26:46.098
We got you. kid!
It's gonna be all right!

509

Come on. now you better breathe!
You ain't got permission to die!

Come on. come on. come on.

-No. no. no. no. no.
-No!

That's it.
That does it!

00:26:57.375 --> 00:26:59.144
Who wants to sink
a Kraut submarine?

I never thought you'd ask.

515
00:27:00.752 --> 00:27:02.620
This ends right here and now!

We got 'em!

Yeah!

We did it!

00:27:56.104 --> 00:27:58.071
Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about!

533
00:28:06.818 --> 00:28:08.345
Looks like Bauer
got his U-boat after all.

534
00:28:09.051 --> 00:28:10.380
Good work. men.
Great work!

535
00:28:10.415 --> 00:28:11.821
Skip?

536
00:28:11.856 --> 00:28:13.020
What is it?

537
00:28:14.353 --> 00:28:15.418
Jeffries is dead.

538
00:28:18.324 --> 00:28:19.829
Damn it.

539
00:28:36.078 --> 00:28:38.243
Donald Jeffries
didn't sign up for this.

540
00:28:38.278 --> 00:28:39.816
None of you men did.

541
00:28:40.313 --> 00:28:42.478
A merchant ship
is built to move supplies.

542
00:28:42.513 --> 00:28:45.822
not to go head to head with
enemy U-boats and destroyers.

543
00:28:46.253 --> 00:28:48.858
But that's what we've
been assigned to do.

544
00:28:49.256 --> 00:28:51.454
No. Jeffries didn't volunteer
for this kind of work.

545
00:28:51.489 --> 00:28:54.127
But when called to duty.
he performed valiantly.

546
00:28:54.866 --> 00:28:56.767
He did what he had to
when he had to do it

547
00:28:56.802 --> 00:28:58.494
without concern
for his own safety.

548
00:28:59.332 --> 00:29:01.299
He wanted nothing more than
to get off this bucket

549
00:29:01.334 --> 00:29:03.873
so he could head home and
take over the family farm.

550
00:29:04.843 --> 00:29:06.271
But he didn't get that chance.

551
00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:08.273
He's not gonna get
to go home because he got

552
00:29:08.308 --> 00:29:12.783
killed doing his job.
his job as an American.

553
00:29:13.478 --> 00:29:15.412
The best we can do going
forward is

554
00:29:15.447 --> 00:29:17.414
to respect his sacrifice
by doing our job

555
00:29:17.449 --> 00:29:19.317
so we can all
get outta this mess

556
00:29:19.352 --> 00:29:21.891
and get back to our families
where we belong.

557
00:29:29.164 --> 00:29:30.768
[radio static]

558
00:29:31.298 --> 00:29:32.231
Commander Barnes?

559
00:29:34.499 --> 00:29:37.038
I understand that
you ran into some action.

560
00:29:37.469 --> 00:29:38.502
Yes. sir.

561
00:29:38.537 --> 00:29:40.338
We lost a man in a fire
fight with a U-boat. sir.

562
00:29:40.373 --> 00:29:42.208
Jesus.

563
00:29:42.243 --> 00:29:44.980
This is exactly what
I did not want to happen.

564
00:29:45.312 --> 00:29:46.511
It couldn't be avoided.
Commander.

565
00:29:46.547 --> 00:29:48.984
Are you telling me there was
nowhere else in the entire ocean

566
00:29:49.019 --> 00:29:51.888
for you to go except head
to head with a German U-boat?

567
00:29:52.187 --> 00:29:53.516
It was us or them. sir.

568
00:29:53.551 --> 00:29:56.024
Lieutenant Snow saw
an opportunity and he took it.

569
00:29:56.059 --> 00:29:57.861
There was no opportunity!

570
00:29:58.226 --> 00:30:00.831
You have a mission!
This is Snow being Snow!

571
00:30:01.196 --> 00:30:03.031
I know you're going to need
his fighting spirit

572
00:30:03.066 --> 00:30:07.200
when you reached that coast.
but not one damn minute before.

573
00:30:07.598 --> 00:30:11.941
Now I want you to tell me.
between the two of us.

574
00:30:12.339 --> 00:30:14.812
can you keep
Lieutenant Snow on course?

575
00:30:16.079 --> 00:30:17.408
I will do
everything short of mutiny

576
00:30:17.443 --> 00:30:19.344
to keep the lieutenant
on target. sir.

577
00:30:21.612 --> 00:30:23.051
But. sir...

578
00:30:23.086 --> 00:30:24.085
But what. Ensign?

579
00:30:24.483 --> 00:30:26.120
We're sitting ducks out here.

580
00:30:26.155 --> 00:30:28.485
And we both know the men
are not combat-ready.

581
00:30:29.224 --> 00:30:30.927
They got a lot of heart. but--

582
00:30:30.962 --> 00:30:32.357
What are you driving at. Ford?

583
00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:37.065
Is there really no help in
the area for us. Commander?

584
00:30:37.496 --> 00:30:40.497
Every damn vessel is accounted
for and you know that.

585
00:30:42.501 --> 00:30:45.271
Any escort would be
much appreciated. sir.

586
00:30:45.537 --> 00:30:48.241
You do your part and make
sure Snow clears that beach

587
00:30:48.276 --> 00:30:50.507
and I'll see if I can
find someone to divert.

588
00:30:52.346 --> 00:30:53.411
Thank you. sir.

589
00:31:03.654 --> 00:31:05.060
[knocking]

590
00:31:05.095 --> 00:31:06.324
Come in!

591
00:31:10.397 --> 00:31:12.133
Those were some nice words
you said out there.

592
00:31:13.301 --> 00:31:15.103
Well. the kid was 19 years old.

593
00:31:15.534 --> 00:31:18.238
How do you sum up a man's life
when he never got to live one?

594
00:31:20.011 --> 00:31:22.011
We wouldn't be burying him
if you didn't take on that sub.

595
00:31:23.674 --> 00:31:25.278
What's that supposed to mean?

596
00:31:26.578 --> 00:31:29.018
We're burying a man at
sea because you're acting

597
00:31:29.053 --> 00:31:30.283
like you have
something to prove.

598
00:31:32.023 --> 00:31:34.287
We had a chance
to sink a U-boat.

599
00:31:34.322 --> 00:31:36.322
I'm not gonna back down
from that responsibility.

600
00:31:36.357 --> 00:31:37.620
That's my job.

601
00:31:38.359 --> 00:31:40.029
Not on this mission.

602
00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:41.626
With all due respect. sir.

603
00:31:41.661 --> 00:31:44.363
your recklessness has caused
a young man to lose his life

604
00:31:44.398 --> 00:31:47.003
when we should be on our way
to Italy to clear that coast out

605
00:31:47.038 --> 00:31:49.566
for our boys invading
so they don't get cut to shreds

606
00:31:49.601 --> 00:31:52.140
by the most dangerous
gun the Germans have!

607
00:31:52.175 --> 00:31:55.275
A PT boat was lost
and an entire crew killed

608
00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:57.310
because I didn't have
the guts to take action!

609
00:31:58.214 --> 00:31:59.675
I'm not gonna make
that mistake again.

610
00:32:01.184 --> 00:32:03.184
They were killed because
of your recklessness.

611
00:32:03.219 --> 00:32:06.583
Jeffries was killed because
you didn't listen to your crew.

612
00:32:09.588 --> 00:32:10.587
We're in a war.

613
00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:13.359
You told me yourself
you cannot choose your battle.

614
00:32:13.394 --> 00:32:14.360
You said that.

615
00:32:15.429 --> 00:32:17.231
Well. I was mistaken.

616
00:32:17.266 --> 00:32:19.596
Sometimes you can make a choice.
And you made the wrong choice.

617
00:32:21.039 --> 00:32:22.665
It could happen
to any one of us.

618
00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:26.273
So just stop worrying
about your guts!

619
00:32:26.308 --> 00:32:28.176
You are the toughest man I know!

620
00:32:31.082 --> 00:32:32.213
Are you finished?

621
00:32:34.613 --> 00:32:36.415
I make no promises.

622
00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:39.286
Sir. I have General Bradley
on the radio.

623
00:32:39.321 --> 00:32:40.485
-Bradley?
-Bradley?

624
00:32:41.752 --> 00:32:43.488
Don't let that go to your head!

625
00:32:45.228 --> 00:32:46.491
[gunfire]

626
00:32:48.726 --> 00:32:50.693
Lieutenant. good news!

627
00:32:50.728 --> 00:32:52.134
The Italians are out of the war.

628
00:32:52.169 --> 00:32:53.234
Italy surrendered?

629
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:54.301
That's right.

630
00:32:54.336 --> 00:32:56.237
Ike announced it 10 minutes ago.

631
00:32:57.108 --> 00:32:59.471
We always knew the Italians
were paper tigers.

632
00:33:00.243 --> 00:33:01.979
They quit the minute
we took Sicily.

633
00:33:02.245 --> 00:33:05.378
which means those 88s are gonna
be manned by crack Nazi troops.

634
00:33:06.183 --> 00:33:08.282
And they never faced
U.S. Navy. sir.

635
00:33:08.317 --> 00:33:09.712
It's gonna be
one hell of a fight.

636
00:33:09.747 --> 00:33:11.648
But I'm counting on you
to take that beach.

637
00:33:12.321 --> 00:33:13.991
I got the best crew
in the U.S. Navy.

638
00:33:14.257 --> 00:33:15.355
So I've heard.

639
00:33:15.819 --> 00:33:17.654
Commander. anything
you'd like to add?

640
00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:21.592
Well. Snow. you can expect
the Germans

641
00:33:21.627 --> 00:33:23.792
to take over naval
operations as well.

642
00:33:23.827 --> 00:33:26.135
Nazis don't miss a beat.
do they. sir?

643
00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:27.697
No. they do not.

644
00:33:27.732 --> 00:33:30.172
You're gonna be faced with
German destroyers and F-Lighters

645
00:33:30.207 --> 00:33:31.503
up and down that coast.

646
00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:34.275
These boys don't play nice.

647
00:33:34.805 --> 00:33:37.542
Neither do we. sir.
Neither do we.

648
00:33:45.585 --> 00:33:47.486
[jazz music plays]

649
00:33:47.521 --> 00:33:49.158
Come on. Act like you
wanna win some money.

650
00:33:49.787 --> 00:33:51.424
He doesn't wanna win.
He's gonna lose.

651
00:33:52.361 --> 00:33:54.064
Give it right here.
Put it on the table.

652
00:33:54.099 --> 00:33:56.033
Hey. how about not
cheating this time?

653
00:33:56.563 --> 00:33:58.200
Yeah. I heard about you.

654
00:33:58.235 --> 00:33:59.564
You know exactly
what you're doing.

655
00:33:59.599 --> 00:34:01.302
Yeah. you're the guy
with three aces.

656
00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:03.205
I don't know why
you're dealing.

657
00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.569
-He had six aces at once.
-Yeah.

658
00:34:05.803 --> 00:34:06.669
I'll tell you what. boys.

659
00:34:06.704 --> 00:34:08.309
With all this money
I'm about to win.

660
00:34:08.344 --> 00:34:10.278
I'm gonna get a tattoo of
my girl.

661
00:34:10.313 --> 00:34:11.642
Oh. yeah!

662
00:34:11.677 --> 00:34:12.808
Romeo!

663
00:34:12.843 --> 00:34:14.150
Hey. Bauer!

664
00:34:14.581 --> 00:34:16.152
Your meatloaf special!

665
00:34:16.418 --> 00:34:17.450
Grovener. you got that?

666
00:34:17.485 --> 00:34:18.583
-Yeah. I got it.
-Thanks. pal.

667
00:34:18.618 --> 00:34:20.123
You gotta try this.

668
00:34:20.158 --> 00:34:21.454
This is the best meatloaf
in the world.

669
00:34:23.425 --> 00:34:26.327
Well. I don't know what my mom
would do if I got a tattoo.

670
00:34:27.198 --> 00:34:28.593
You know what?

671
00:34:29.134 --> 00:34:30.859
Every one you get
will desensitize her.

672
00:34:30.894 --> 00:34:32.135
I know mine did.

673
00:34:33.402 --> 00:34:35.732
You're gonna love Cookie's
special meatloaf.

674
00:34:36.438 --> 00:34:37.470
Best meal of the month.

675
00:34:37.505 --> 00:34:38.702
Oh. yeah.

676
00:34:38.737 --> 00:34:40.242
I could eat a bear.

677
00:34:40.574 --> 00:34:42.772
Hey. Cookie. you want
in on this game or what?

678
00:34:42.807 --> 00:34:44.246
I need someone with some balls

679
00:34:44.281 --> 00:34:45.775
and isn't afraid
to lose some money.

680
00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:47.513
-Ooh!
-Hey!

681
00:34:47.548 --> 00:34:48.679
I gotta get back to the kitchen

682
00:34:48.714 --> 00:34:51.121
and make another
special meatloaf.

683
00:34:54.225 --> 00:34:55.488
Take a little bite.

684
00:34:57.294 --> 00:34:59.393
Yeah. yeah. the whole thing.

685
00:34:59.428 --> 00:35:00.889
That's real good. huh?

686
00:35:00.924 --> 00:35:02.363
What you think about that?

687
00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:04.629
-You like it?
-It's real tasty. isn't it?

688
00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:06.763
What's wrong?

689
00:35:09.471 --> 00:35:11.207
That's not hot.
Keep going.

690
00:35:12.474 --> 00:35:13.737
Owie. that's hot!

691
00:35:13.772 --> 00:35:15.145
-Oh. yeah?
-It's real hot!

692
00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:17.279
Give me some water!
Give me the water!

693
00:35:17.314 --> 00:35:18.577
[laughing]

694
00:35:22.484 --> 00:35:23.846
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

695
00:35:23.881 --> 00:35:24.980
What the hell. Cookie?

696
00:35:25.016 --> 00:35:26.915
Want to make the meal a little
less spicy next time?

697
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:28.752
[laughing]

698
00:35:28.787 --> 00:35:30.853
Hey. that's the way we do
it in Texas. okay?

699
00:35:30.888 --> 00:35:32.360
Put a little hair on your nuts!

700
00:35:36.663 --> 00:35:38.201
Hey. where you going?

701
00:35:42.273 --> 00:35:46.572
So getting a hit in 56 straight
games isn't a big deal?

702
00:35:46.607 --> 00:35:49.179
It's a huge deal.
but it's trivia.

703
00:35:49.214 --> 00:35:51.346
Come on. when somebody puts
milk bottles on their heads

704
00:35:51.381 --> 00:35:52.875
and balances 'em.
it's impressive.

705
00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:54.613
But it don't mean
they should be president!

706
00:35:54.648 --> 00:35:57.550
That is the dumbest thing
I have ever heard.

707
00:35:57.585 --> 00:35:58.684
Milk bottles?

708
00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:01.455
DiMaggio is the greatest
centerfielder of all times.

709
00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:03.754
But did he bat .400?

710
00:36:04.955 --> 00:36:06.559
I hear the Braves
are doing good this year.

711
00:36:07.628 --> 00:36:09.562
That's just... what?

712
00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.367
I'm beginning to think you don't
know what you're talking about.

713
00:36:12.831 --> 00:36:13.962
Get this guy outta here.

714
00:36:13.997 --> 00:36:15.370
Yeah. get out of here.

715
00:36:15.405 --> 00:36:16.866
You're not here.
you're not here.

716
00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:19.539
Who wants to finish this?

717
00:36:20.675 --> 00:36:21.970
Yeah. I'll take a bite. Leave it
right here on the table.

718
00:36:22.005 --> 00:36:23.675
All right. let's go.

719
00:36:29.881 --> 00:36:32.321
Counterintelligence
is now reporting increased

720
00:36:32.356 --> 00:36:34.488
German naval activity
off Salerno.

721
00:36:35.458 --> 00:36:38.195
Looks like Hitler wants to hold
onto Italy as long as he can.

722
00:36:38.692 --> 00:36:39.758
Yeah.

723
00:36:39.793 --> 00:36:41.594
And air reconnaissance
just spotted what looks like

724
00:36:41.629 --> 00:36:44.960
an enemy destroyer opposite
the coastal artillery unit.

725
00:36:46.469 --> 00:36:48.634
I hope Snow
and his cowboys are ready.

726
00:36:48.669 --> 00:36:49.899
They'll be ready. sir.

727
00:36:51.771 --> 00:36:54.970
Think they can handle a Kraut
destroyer with five-inch guns?

728
00:36:55.005 --> 00:36:57.005
Snow's a salty
son of a bitch. sir.

729
00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.842
If anyone can. it's him.

730
00:37:00.285 --> 00:37:01.284
Better be right.

731
00:37:08.722 --> 00:37:11.261
Hey! A roof! Now that's
major home improvement!

732
00:37:11.296 --> 00:37:12.790
That's what I've been
trying to tell her.

733
00:37:12.825 --> 00:37:13.991
Yeah.

734
00:37:14.026 --> 00:37:16.233
Definitely something that
she shouldn't try on her own.

735
00:37:16.565 --> 00:37:17.798
It leaks a little.
I get it.

736
00:37:17.833 --> 00:37:20.468
But. you know. put a bucket down
or something until I get back.

737
00:37:20.503 --> 00:37:21.369
I don't wanna be ripped off

738
00:37:21.404 --> 00:37:23.405
because some jerk
knows I'm overseas.

739
00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:24.736
Hey. a guy could take advantage.

740
00:37:24.771 --> 00:37:26.034
Yeah. exactly.

741
00:37:26.069 --> 00:37:30.643
Single woman at home
by herself. helpless?

742
00:37:30.678 --> 00:37:32.876
Come on. it happens
all the time.

743
00:37:33.978 --> 00:37:35.912
Wait. What?
What do you mean?

744
00:37:35.947 --> 00:37:38.783
No. We're in love.
She wouldn't do that. right?

745
00:37:38.818 --> 00:37:40.620
She wouldn't do that.

746
00:37:40.655 --> 00:37:42.886
Irish to the bridge.
Irish to the bridge.

747
00:37:42.921 --> 00:37:43.953
You better go!

748
00:37:43.988 --> 00:37:45.526
Don't try to change the subject!

749
00:37:46.628 --> 00:37:47.957
I'm coming right back!

750
00:38:05.548 --> 00:38:07.284
Hey. you thinking about
swimming to Italy?

751
00:38:08.683 --> 00:38:11.684
I wasn't supposed to get into
another firefight again.

752
00:38:12.016 --> 00:38:15.787
That wasn't the plan.
but here we are. pal.

753
00:38:16.691 --> 00:38:20.297
Well. I been in one war
and that's one too many.

754
00:38:21.597 --> 00:38:24.334
I'd feel the same way if
I served on the Jacob Jones.

755
00:38:25.095 --> 00:38:28.635
Wow. I was so proud to
be manning a four-incher

756
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:30.967
on a world-class destroyer.

757
00:38:32.608 --> 00:38:34.872
I was good. too.
Boy. I was real good.

758
00:38:34.907 --> 00:38:36.412
So I heard. Cookie.

759
00:38:37.008 --> 00:38:38.711
You know. after
we got torpedoed.

760
00:38:40.418 --> 00:38:42.979
the Jacob Jones
went down so fast.

761
00:38:43.916 --> 00:38:46.587
we didn't even send out
a distress call.

762
00:38:48.525 --> 00:38:49.821
60 men...

763
00:38:50.857 --> 00:38:52.725
60 men lost
in eight minutes.

764
00:38:54.993 --> 00:38:58.467
I swore I'd never be
on a combat ship again.

765
00:38:59.635 --> 00:39:02.702
Well. if it helps.
if it's any consolation at all.

766
00:39:02.737 --> 00:39:04.869
you are the best cook
in the U.S. Navy.

767
00:39:04.904 --> 00:39:06.673
Damn right.

768
00:39:06.708 --> 00:39:08.609
I take care of my men.

769
00:39:09.546 --> 00:39:11.139
If there's one thing
I've learned in this man's Navy

770
00:39:11.174 --> 00:39:13.350
is that everybody's got
their own part of the play.

771
00:39:13.781 --> 00:39:16.749
From the galley to the head
and all the assholes in between

772
00:39:17.048 --> 00:39:19.719
it takes all of us
to make a Navy ship.

773
00:39:20.557 --> 00:39:24.493
even a broken down Liberty ship
like the Lawton B. Evans.

774
00:39:25.595 --> 00:39:27.089
You know what? I'd better
get back to the kitchen.

775
00:39:27.124 --> 00:39:28.365
Okay.

776
00:39:29.534 --> 00:39:30.961
You know. why can't we have
any tequila on this boat?

777
00:39:31.469 --> 00:39:33.700
Because. we're in Europe.

778
00:39:33.735 --> 00:39:37.374
If we get over to Acapulco.
I will get you some tequila.

779
00:39:38.509 --> 00:39:40.641
Acapulco. here we come.

780
00:39:49.014 --> 00:39:50.453
Keep an eye out for any vessels

781
00:39:50.488 --> 00:39:52.015
that might try to
kill us in this mess.

782
00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:53.720
As always. Skip.

783
00:39:54.459 --> 00:39:56.426
Yeah. watch out for some
giant squid while you're at it.

784
00:39:56.890 --> 00:39:58.758
Definitely.
That's the last thing we need.

785
00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.465
Not too far from
the coast. are we?

786
00:40:02.731 --> 00:40:03.928
Just out of our radar.

787
00:40:04.766 --> 00:40:05.798
So about 30 miles?

788
00:40:09.771 --> 00:40:11.037
You know. you got
a hell of a crew here.

789
00:40:11.073 --> 00:40:15.610
Best in the Navy and that's not
just something I tell people.

790
00:40:31.694 --> 00:40:34.024
Whoa. whoa. you can't do that.

791
00:40:35.225 --> 00:40:36.024
Why not?

792
00:40:36.963 --> 00:40:38.831
It's not a move.
It's not a chess move.

793
00:40:39.834 --> 00:40:40.967
But it makes sense.

794
00:40:41.002 --> 00:40:43.165
That's where I want my piece
to go. so I put it there.

795
00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:44.804
Knights don't move like that.

796
00:40:44.839 --> 00:40:45.838
Why not?

797
00:40:45.874 --> 00:40:47.543
What do you mean. why not?
Those are the rules.

798
00:40:47.908 --> 00:40:48.940
But...

799
00:40:48.975 --> 00:40:50.007
Ah. jeez.

800
00:40:50.042 --> 00:40:51.107
Can a pawn do that?

801
00:40:51.142 --> 00:40:52.174
Yeah. of course.

802
00:40:52.209 --> 00:40:53.582
Well then. why not
the horse guy?

803
00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:55.650
We've been over this.

804
00:40:55.685 --> 00:40:58.455
The knights
do this L-shaped thing.

805
00:41:01.592 --> 00:41:02.888
Aren't knights more
valuable than pawns?

806
00:41:02.923 --> 00:41:03.988
Yeah.

807
00:41:04.023 --> 00:41:05.253
Then why can't
they move like pawns?

808
00:41:05.288 --> 00:41:06.760
I don't know. Just...

809
00:41:07.994 --> 00:41:10.467
Knights can't do the thing
you're trying to do.

810
00:41:11.063 --> 00:41:14.867
They only move in this L-shaped
way like we talked about.

811
00:41:20.809 --> 00:41:22.270
-Whoa. whoa...
-Is that better?

812
00:41:22.305 --> 00:41:23.876
-Yeah. that's...
-Whoa.

813
00:41:25.715 --> 00:41:26.945
Look at that.

814
00:41:27.585 --> 00:41:28.617
What?

815
00:41:28.652 --> 00:41:29.684
What's happening?

816
00:41:29.719 --> 00:41:30.718
Noth--nothing.

817
00:41:31.754 --> 00:41:33.754
-Did I just...
-Seriously?

818
00:41:33.789 --> 00:41:34.688
Did I win?

819
00:41:34.724 --> 00:41:36.790
-You better tell him.
-I won. didn't I?

820
00:41:36.825 --> 00:41:38.990
[cheering]

821
00:41:39.025 --> 00:41:40.189
Yeah!

822
00:41:42.259 --> 00:41:43.599
One for Minnesota!

823
00:41:43.634 --> 00:41:45.029
[shouting]

824
00:41:45.064 --> 00:41:46.932
General quarters!
General quarters!

825
00:41:46.967 --> 00:41:48.032
All men. man your
battle stations!

826
00:41:48.067 --> 00:41:49.671
-I win!
-It doesn't count.

827
00:41:49.706 --> 00:41:51.299
General quarters!
General quarters!

828
00:41:51.334 --> 00:41:53.169
All men. man your
battle stations!

829
00:41:53.776 --> 00:41:54.907
General quarters!

830
00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:01.749
Bauer. we got a destroyer
in the area. General quarters.

831
00:42:02.081 --> 00:42:03.553
If I catch one.
I'll let you know.

832
00:42:05.018 --> 00:42:06.787
Man your post. sailor!

833
00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:10.923
[chuckles]

834
00:42:15.193 --> 00:42:16.665
Get us lined up. Grovener.

835
00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:18.260
Get you lined up.
I'll get you lined up.

836
00:42:18.295 --> 00:42:20.163
-All right. all right.
-We're in line. we're in line.

837
00:42:26.204 --> 00:42:27.643
You sure it's that destroyer?

838
00:42:27.942 --> 00:42:30.041
I don't know. but it's big.

839
00:42:31.044 --> 00:42:32.549
Should we reverse course?

840
00:42:32.947 --> 00:42:33.980
Well. let's pause a while

841
00:42:34.015 --> 00:42:37.587
and see what that thing is
and where it's headed.

842
00:42:37.622 --> 00:42:39.215
Dead slow ahead.

843
00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:41.657
Aye. aye. sir.
Dead slow ahead.

844
00:42:58.973 --> 00:43:00.577
I don't see nothing.

845
00:43:03.681 --> 00:43:04.845
Bauer! General quarters!

846
00:43:05.848 --> 00:43:07.683
I know. but. sir...

847
00:43:07.718 --> 00:43:09.685
We're headlong into
a destroyer. sailor!

848
00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:11.016
Get the lead out!

849
00:43:11.051 --> 00:43:12.184
I got something. sir!

850
00:43:12.219 --> 00:43:13.953
I don't know what it is. but
it's gotta be pretty big!

851
00:43:13.988 --> 00:43:14.954
Well. why didn't you tell me?

852
00:43:14.989 --> 00:43:17.352
Here. Let me reel it in!
You go prep your gun!

853
00:43:17.387 --> 00:43:19.860
Thank you. sir. You have no idea
how much means to me!

854
00:43:19.895 --> 00:43:22.896
Yeah. My God. I'd hate you
to lose your fish.

855
00:43:22.931 --> 00:43:24.293
Thank you. sir.

856
00:43:24.328 --> 00:43:25.360
No!

857
00:43:25.395 --> 00:43:26.999
We're in a war. sailor!

858
00:43:27.034 --> 00:43:29.606
You go man that gun or
I throw you in the drink!

859
00:43:39.409 --> 00:43:40.275
Do you see it?

860
00:43:40.982 --> 00:43:43.312
-Oh. God bless it.
-I don't hear anything.

861
00:43:44.018 --> 00:43:45.083
Aw. man.

862
00:43:46.186 --> 00:43:48.185
I can't believe that
we're looking for a destroyer

863
00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:49.890
instead of delivering supplies.

864
00:43:50.222 --> 00:43:52.288
If only my old man
could see me now.

865
00:43:54.127 --> 00:43:55.390
I hear nothing.

866
00:43:55.425 --> 00:43:56.864
Do you?

867
00:43:56.899 --> 00:43:58.162
Not a damn thing!

868
00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.307
Do you see anything. Grovener?

869
00:44:11.342 --> 00:44:12.847
I don't see nothing. Tony.

870
00:44:13.718 --> 00:44:15.245
That's what scares me.

871
00:44:19.284 --> 00:44:20.987
I know we got
a destroyer out there.

872
00:44:21.022 --> 00:44:22.186
I just can't see it.

873
00:44:23.255 --> 00:44:25.728
What's standard operating
procedure for pea soup?

874
00:44:25.763 --> 00:44:29.127
What I'm doing. moving
as little as possible.

875
00:44:29.162 --> 00:44:30.667
Any update on that ship?

876
00:44:31.736 --> 00:44:34.165
It's close. sir. real close.

877
00:44:34.772 --> 00:44:38.235
Well. lucky for us. Kraut
radar's as bad as ours.

878
00:44:39.172 --> 00:44:41.139
Also need to make sure
we don't drift too close

879
00:44:41.174 --> 00:44:43.141
to the shoreline in
range of those 88s.

880
00:44:43.946 --> 00:44:45.814
Back in Annapolis.
they don't tell you what to do

881
00:44:45.849 --> 00:44:47.442
if you can't see
or hear anything.

882
00:44:48.951 --> 00:44:50.819
That's why they pay you
the big bucks. sir.

883
00:44:51.822 --> 00:44:53.822
I expected more
than $150 a week.

884
00:44:57.223 --> 00:44:58.827
See anything?

885
00:44:58.862 --> 00:44:59.828
No.

886
00:45:13.338 --> 00:45:14.469
I got nothing!

887
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:21.982
There's something on the radar.

888
00:45:22.952 --> 00:45:24.380
You guys hear that?

889
00:45:24.415 --> 00:45:25.381
Yeah. I still hear it.

890
00:45:27.385 --> 00:45:28.418
It's getting closer.

891
00:45:29.387 --> 00:45:31.354
Destroyer coming right at us!
30 degrees to port!

892
00:45:31.389 --> 00:45:32.828
30 degrees to port!

893
00:45:36.834 --> 00:45:37.998
It's coming right towards us.

894
00:45:38.396 --> 00:45:40.836
-Hard right rudder!
-Hard right rudder!

895
00:45:51.376 --> 00:45:52.881
Prepare depth charges!

896
00:45:52.916 --> 00:45:54.014
Full to starboard.

897
00:45:54.049 --> 00:45:55.752
Fire at will.
fire at will.

898
00:45:56.084 --> 00:45:57.215
Full to starboard.

899
00:45:57.250 --> 00:45:59.415
Depth charge starboard. now!

900
00:45:59.450 --> 00:46:01.087
Depth charge starboard. now!

902
00:46:06.358 --> 00:46:07.896
-Fire! Fire!
-Light 'em up. boys.

903
00:46:07.931 --> 00:46:09.392
Fire!
Come on!

904
00:46:13.167 --> 00:46:14.870
-Bringing fire.
-Firing!

905
00:46:20.438 --> 00:46:21.910
Did we get 'em?

[gunfire]

907
00:46:32.186 --> 00:46:33.218
We got men on the shore!

908
00:46:33.253 --> 00:46:34.351
Krauts on the shore!

909
00:46:39.424 --> 00:46:40.995
We found those guns
you're looking for!

910
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:42.128
They're gonna tear us to shreds!

911
00:46:42.163 --> 00:46:43.360
You think I don't know that?

912
00:46:45.562 --> 00:46:46.968
[shouting]

913
00:46:47.003 --> 00:46:48.838
-Take cover!
-Take cover! Take cover!

914
00:46:48.873 --> 00:46:51.335
We got shots coming
from shore battery!

915
00:46:53.174 --> 00:46:56.010
I want to see heavy fire
directed to that beach.

916
00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:58.342
Fire all guns!

917
00:47:06.616 --> 00:47:07.890
[shouts]

918
00:47:08.893 --> 00:47:10.387

920
00:47:12.391 --> 00:47:13.357
Firing!

921
00:47:16.197 --> 00:47:17.933
Oh. my foot!

922
00:47:19.497 --> 00:47:20.969
Move out!

923
00:47:21.004 --> 00:47:23.268
Oh. I got it in the foot.
Get off me! Get off me!

924
00:47:23.303 --> 00:47:24.335
Don't you have a job to do?

925
00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:26.370
Shut up. you moron!
I'm trying--

926
00:47:26.405 --> 00:47:28.174
Oh. my goddamned foot.

927
00:47:28.209 --> 00:47:29.373
It's just a nick.
it's just a nick.

928
00:47:29.408 --> 00:47:31.111
Oh. no. you remember Curry?

929
00:47:31.641 --> 00:47:33.982
He almost died when he shot
himself in the toe.

930
00:47:34.017 --> 00:47:35.049
I'm not gonna die.

931
00:47:35.084 --> 00:47:36.314
You don't know that!

932
00:47:36.349 --> 00:47:37.986
Come on. let's get
you below deck.

933
00:47:38.021 --> 00:47:39.251
Get you to see a medic.

934
00:47:40.221 --> 00:47:41.385
Get up. you big lug!

935
00:47:43.224 --> 00:47:45.059
Come on.

936
00:47:47.129 --> 00:47:48.260
[shouting]

937
00:47:50.264 --> 00:47:51.329
Sir. you gotta
watch that portal!

938
00:47:51.364 --> 00:47:52.396
You're gonna take a bullet!

939
00:47:53.168 --> 00:47:54.970
My time will come when it comes.

940
00:47:56.666 --> 00:47:58.402
They better be avoiding
those U-boats!

941
00:47:58.976 --> 00:48:00.008
They'd better!

942
00:48:14.321 --> 00:48:15.551
[explosion]

943
00:48:17.291 --> 00:48:19.962
That wasn't good.
It sounded like the engine room!

944
00:48:19.997 --> 00:48:21.425
[groans]

945
00:48:22.725 --> 00:48:24.901
Redeker? Are you okay?

946
00:48:25.266 --> 00:48:27.629
I'm all right!
Call top-side.

947
00:48:34.341 --> 00:48:36.110
Clevenger. were you hit?

948
00:48:36.442 --> 00:48:38.046
A shell tore through the side!

949
00:48:38.081 --> 00:48:41.049
Boiler one's down and boiler
two is losing pressure fast!

950
00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:42.952
Can you get 'em patched up?

951
00:48:42.987 --> 00:48:44.052
I can try.

952
00:48:45.288 --> 00:48:47.286
I can try and patch it. but
what about getting to Salerno?

953
00:48:48.091 --> 00:48:49.651
I'll send some men
to work the pumps.

954
00:48:52.425 --> 00:48:54.557
I'm fine!
It's fine!

955
00:48:54.592 --> 00:48:56.295
I'm fine. Tony!

956
00:48:56.330 --> 00:48:57.494
It's nothing. all right?

957
00:48:57.529 --> 00:48:58.693
Let's see how nothing it is.

958
00:48:58.728 --> 00:49:00.662
-Oh. that hurts!
-How does that feel?

959
00:49:00.697 --> 00:49:02.169
-It hurts!
-And there?

960
00:49:02.204 --> 00:49:03.665
It still hurts.

961
00:49:05.207 --> 00:49:07.339
Sounds like a ceasefire.
Maybe we're out of range.

962
00:49:07.704 --> 00:49:09.506
Oh. God! What.
are you trying to kill me?

963
00:49:09.541 --> 00:49:11.046
I'm not trying to kill you.
I'm just trying

964
00:49:11.081 --> 00:49:12.377
to make sure you're not dying!

965
00:49:12.412 --> 00:49:14.181
Listen. you can't say
nothing to no one.

966
00:49:14.216 --> 00:49:16.579
I don't wanna get sent back
to Sicily. I'm fine!

967
00:49:16.614 --> 00:49:18.449
Maybe I want you to
go back to Sicily!

968
00:49:18.484 --> 00:49:19.884
Maybe I'll shove
my boot up your ass!

969
00:49:19.919 --> 00:49:22.519
Wait a second!
You ain't even been shot.
you got shot in the boot!

970
00:49:22.554 --> 00:49:24.026
Well. it still hurts!

971
00:49:24.061 --> 00:49:25.357
Ah. it works because
you're a wuss!

972
00:49:25.392 --> 00:49:27.425
-Come on. get back in the fight!
-Here we go.

973
00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:29.196
Chief!
Chief!

974
00:49:29.231 --> 00:49:30.395
No. no.

975
00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:32.100
Hey. we got help coming.

976
00:49:32.366 --> 00:49:33.596
We got help coming.
so just hold on.

977
00:49:35.105 --> 00:49:36.764
I don't think that's
gonna be necessary.

978
00:49:36.799 --> 00:49:37.974
What are you talking about?

979
00:49:39.703 --> 00:49:40.735
Clev...

980
00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:42.341
No. I just gotta hold pressure.

981
00:49:42.376 --> 00:49:44.508
Would you just shut up.
all right?

982
00:49:45.247 --> 00:49:46.477
Clev. stop!

983
00:49:47.744 --> 00:49:48.985
Clev. stop.

984
00:49:52.089 --> 00:49:53.451
When you get back to San Fran.

985
00:49:54.784 --> 00:49:57.092
I want you to tell Em and
the girls that I love 'em.

986
00:50:02.132 --> 00:50:03.725
And that I'll see 'em
on the other side.

987
00:50:04.662 --> 00:50:05.661
I will. buddy.

988
00:50:06.796 --> 00:50:08.400
You do that for me.

989
00:50:08.435 --> 00:50:10.138
Yes. Okay.

990
00:50:11.174 --> 00:50:13.141
You're the best friend
I got. Clev.

991
00:50:17.774 --> 00:50:19.114
No!

992
00:50:19.149 --> 00:50:21.743
No. no. no. no.
please. please.

993
00:50:31.557 --> 00:50:33.392
The boys are stemming
the bleeding.

994
00:50:34.098 --> 00:50:35.394
We're powerless
for another hour.

995
00:50:35.429 --> 00:50:36.626
But we'll stay afloat
if we don't take

996
00:50:36.661 --> 00:50:37.792
another hit like that!

997
00:50:38.333 --> 00:50:39.399
What should we do?

998
00:50:39.434 --> 00:50:41.433
We'll never make it out
of here without full power.

999
00:50:46.308 --> 00:50:48.473
Maybe we don't have to.

1000
00:50:49.311 --> 00:50:50.310
What?

1001
00:50:50.708 --> 00:50:52.576
Cease fire!
Cease fire!

1002
00:50:53.216 --> 00:50:54.644
Cease fire?
We'll be sitting ducks!

1003
00:50:55.383 --> 00:50:57.713
Or maybe not! What if they think
they already sunk us?

1004
00:50:59.189 --> 00:51:01.321
Have the boys throw everything
we don't need overboard.

1005
00:51:01.356 --> 00:51:04.522
pots. pans. clothes. pinup girls
and a bunch of our cargo.

1006
00:51:04.557 --> 00:51:06.557
I don't care what it is.
The tide's heading in.

1007
00:51:06.856 --> 00:51:09.791
Everything we throw overboard
to make it look like we've sunk!

1008
00:51:09.826 --> 00:51:11.166
Come on!
Get to work!

1009
00:51:11.201 --> 00:51:13.201
Go. go. go. go. go!

1010
00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:15.797
I don't care what it is!

1011
00:51:15.832 --> 00:51:17.634
We got Krauts firing at
us from all sides.

1012
00:51:17.669 --> 00:51:19.306
If it's not essential to
the war effort.

1013
00:51:19.341 --> 00:51:21.308
I want it thrown into
the briny deep. you understand?

1014
00:51:21.343 --> 00:51:23.277
What if it's
a nice piece of jewelry?

1015
00:51:23.312 --> 00:51:25.477
-Toss it!
-Even if it's real small?

1016
00:51:25.512 --> 00:51:27.479
No! Don't worry about it!

1017
00:51:27.514 --> 00:51:29.316
Okay. so if it's
a big gold necklace.

1018
00:51:29.351 --> 00:51:31.252
for example. we should
throw that in the ocean?

1019
00:51:31.287 --> 00:51:32.550
Did you rob
a pirate ship. Bauer?

1020
00:51:32.585 --> 00:51:33.683
Well. a small ring.
on the other hand--

1021
00:51:33.718 --> 00:51:34.717
Shut the hell up. Bauer!

1022
00:51:34.753 --> 00:51:38.094
I want all this stuff off
the boat in the ocean!

1023
00:51:40.593 --> 00:51:42.428
So long. trash!

1024
00:51:43.167 --> 00:51:44.529
You ever figure what happens
if we still

1025
00:51:44.564 --> 00:51:46.102
get discovered by the Germans?

1026
00:51:46.533 --> 00:51:47.499
It's the law of averages. Moose.

1027
00:51:48.370 --> 00:51:50.172
Maybe they find this stuff.
maybe they won't.

1028
00:51:50.207 --> 00:51:52.141
But are they supposed to?

1029
00:51:52.176 --> 00:51:53.505
Ideally.

1030
00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:55.771
See. I think about
the ancient Egyptians.

1031
00:51:55.806 --> 00:51:57.773
They were always hiding things.

1032
00:51:57.808 --> 00:51:59.148
And they couldn't
have known whether

1033
00:51:59.183 --> 00:52:00.479
we'd find them or we wouldn't.

1034
00:52:00.514 --> 00:52:02.316
What's your point?

1035
00:52:02.351 --> 00:52:03.647
Oh. nothing.

1036
00:52:03.682 --> 00:52:05.715
Just wondering if everything
isn't pointless.

1037
00:52:06.553 --> 00:52:07.783
Wow!

1038
00:52:07.818 --> 00:52:08.916
We're on a junk detail

1039
00:52:08.951 --> 00:52:10.621
and you're getting
existential on me?

1040
00:52:10.656 --> 00:52:12.623
[artillery fire]

1041
00:52:13.758 --> 00:52:14.790
Scheisse!

1042
00:52:15.925 --> 00:52:17.133
Let's get outta here!

1043
00:52:24.241 --> 00:52:25.339
Are we battened down?

1044
00:52:25.374 --> 00:52:26.670
If they can't fire it
or wear it. sir.

1045
00:52:26.705 --> 00:52:27.704
it's headed towards shore.

1046
00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:30.146
Let's hope that satisfies
our German friends.

1047
00:52:43.821 --> 00:52:46.558
Just unwarranted
is all I'm saying.

1048
00:52:46.593 --> 00:52:47.889
Uh-huh.

1049
00:52:47.924 --> 00:52:49.297
All right. hand me the Philips.

1050
00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:51.299
That fishing pole.

1051
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:54.830
it survived Casablanca.
Algiers.

1052
00:52:54.865 --> 00:52:57.800
Tunisia. Messina...

1053
00:52:58.440 --> 00:52:59.901
Did you catch anything?

1054
00:52:59.936 --> 00:53:01.408
What?

1055
00:53:01.443 --> 00:53:02.904
You ever actually
catch anything?

1056
00:53:05.315 --> 00:53:06.578
So what if I didn't?

1057
00:53:07.284 --> 00:53:09.614
Then the pole itself
doesn't matter much. does it?

1058
00:53:09.649 --> 00:53:11.682
I mean. you might
as well have used a baguette.

1059
00:53:11.981 --> 00:53:14.289
It's the principle. Irish.

1060
00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:17.193
That fishing pole was not
his to throw in the ocean.

1061
00:53:17.459 --> 00:53:20.196
Well. he's an officer.
so it kind of is.

1062
00:53:22.728 --> 00:53:24.596
[radio static]

1063
00:53:25.896 --> 00:53:27.335
Oh. will you listen to that?

1064
00:53:27.370 --> 00:53:28.699
Oh. I'm a genius!

1065
00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:31.438
Woo!

1066
00:53:31.473 --> 00:53:32.868
For the boys working the pumps.

1067
00:53:32.903 --> 00:53:35.475
we got maybe 40 minutes
at 10% power.

1068
00:53:35.972 --> 00:53:37.005
Make it last.

1069
00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:39.743
We have less than 24 hours
until the fleet arrives.

1070
00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:41.349
We'll try. sir.

1071
00:53:53.957 --> 00:53:55.429
No sign of the enemy.

1072
00:53:57.367 --> 00:53:59.301
I gotta hand it to you. sir.

1073
00:53:59.864 --> 00:54:00.896
I thought we were goners.

1074
00:54:02.065 --> 00:54:03.998
That idea of yours got us out
of one heck of a pickle.

1075
00:54:05.001 --> 00:54:06.935
Well. we're not out
of the woods yet.

1076
00:54:06.970 --> 00:54:09.641
Captain. I have
an update on the engine.

1077
00:54:09.676 --> 00:54:11.478
All right. give it
to me straight. Doc.

1078
00:54:12.041 --> 00:54:14.041
Clev says we can't do better
than a quarter power

1079
00:54:14.076 --> 00:54:15.515
until we get more parts.

1080
00:54:16.078 --> 00:54:17.517
What about fuel?

1081
00:54:17.552 --> 00:54:19.948
Do we have what we need
to get back to Sicily?

1082
00:54:19.983 --> 00:54:22.654
Probably have enough to get
halfway to Palermo.

1083
00:54:26.396 --> 00:54:28.924
Gather the men.
We need to have a talk.

1084
00:54:33.634 --> 00:54:35.469
That was quite a melee.

1085
00:54:35.504 --> 00:54:37.933
The Krauts hit us
with everything they had

1086
00:54:37.968 --> 00:54:40.276
and you boys
performed brilliantly.

1087
00:54:41.345 --> 00:54:42.311
Yeah!

1088
00:54:44.810 --> 00:54:46.645
You know. I've been eager
to get back to Salerno

1089
00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:47.713
to take out those guns.

1090
00:54:47.748 --> 00:54:50.451
But the engine room bore
the brunt of the fighting.

1091
00:54:50.486 --> 00:54:52.948
and our ship ain't much
without her engines.

1092
00:54:54.787 --> 00:54:56.721
Now the boys down below
have done one hell of a job.

1093
00:54:56.756 --> 00:55:01.528
But the truth is.
we're down 75%.

1094
00:55:01.827 --> 00:55:03.365
And we only have
enough fuel to get us

1095
00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:04.894
about halfway back to base.

1096
00:55:06.931 --> 00:55:10.999
The way I see it. there's no
choice but to abort the mission.

1097
00:55:11.034 --> 00:55:13.474
[clamoring]

1098
00:55:13.509 --> 00:55:15.971
Hey. lock it down. sailors!

1099
00:55:19.581 --> 00:55:21.911
If we try to reach shore
under these conditions.

1100
00:55:21.946 --> 00:55:23.847
there is no going back.

1101
00:55:23.882 --> 00:55:29.358
I mean. once we're onshore.
we own it or we lose it.

1102
00:55:30.493 --> 00:55:31.525
There's no middle ground.

1103
00:55:34.057 --> 00:55:36.431
And if we're lucky enough
to survive until morning...

1104
00:55:36.466 --> 00:55:39.401
and I say if. there's no
guarantee we'll have enough fuel

1105
00:55:39.436 --> 00:55:42.338
to escape whatever fighters or
destroyers they send after us.

1106
00:55:42.604 --> 00:55:43.636
Are you with me?

1107
00:55:43.671 --> 00:55:44.901
What difference does it make

1108
00:55:44.936 --> 00:55:46.540
if we can't make
it back to Palermo?

1109
00:55:46.575 --> 00:55:48.410
We have enough fuel to
steer clear of the beach.

1110
00:55:48.445 --> 00:55:49.708
We'll radio for a tender.

1111
00:55:50.139 --> 00:55:51.743
I'm not crazy about it.

1112
00:55:51.778 --> 00:55:53.613
Yeah. I didn't get shot just
so I could go back

1113
00:55:53.648 --> 00:55:55.846
to Sicily without
seeing Salerno.

1114
00:55:56.145 --> 00:55:58.783
Trying to reach the beach
without enough fuel

1115
00:55:59.489 --> 00:56:01.016
is a suicide mission.

1116
00:56:01.755 --> 00:56:02.820
I always wanted to go to Italy.

1117
00:56:02.855 --> 00:56:03.986
I hear it's lovely.

1118
00:56:06.463 --> 00:56:08.463
I can't ask any
more of you fellas

1119
00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:10.025
than you've already given.

1120
00:56:11.228 --> 00:56:13.963
Skipper. I remember watching
that PT getting hit the way

1121
00:56:13.998 --> 00:56:16.372
they did and I've been
sick about it ever since.

1122
00:56:16.869 --> 00:56:18.440
Everything we done all night

1123
00:56:18.475 --> 00:56:19.903
has been to get back
at the Germans.

1124
00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:22.708
We're so close now. it'd be
a crime to have to head back.

1125
00:56:22.743 --> 00:56:24.006
-Yes.
-It ain't just Moose.

1126
00:56:24.041 --> 00:56:25.579
I've been feeling the same way.

1127
00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:28.384
Skip. we have Commander Barnes
on the radio.

1128
00:56:28.881 --> 00:56:30.111
Dismissed. men!

1129
00:56:32.918 --> 00:56:34.115
-We can't just--
-This is too important to--

1130
00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:35.589
Do you mind?

1131
00:56:35.624 --> 00:56:36.953
Not everyone's a coward
like Marca here!

1132
00:56:37.527 --> 00:56:39.692
You got some real nerve.
You know that?

1133
00:56:39.727 --> 00:56:40.924
Well. you know what. Boston?
Just shut your mouth.

1134
00:56:40.959 --> 00:56:41.991
Oh. come on. buddy boy!

1135
00:56:42.026 --> 00:56:43.564
Oh. yeah.
what are you thinking?

1136
00:56:43.599 --> 00:56:44.697
I'll make that pretty face
something else!

1137
00:56:44.732 --> 00:56:46.468
Hey. hey. hey!

1138
00:56:47.196 --> 00:56:48.536
[radio static]

1139
00:56:53.642 --> 00:56:55.939
Lieutenant Snow.
we're calling off your mission.

1140
00:56:57.547 --> 00:56:59.514
Commander Barnes!
Commander Barnes! Over!

1141
00:57:04.147 --> 00:57:06.587
Commander Barnes.
Commander Barnes. over.

1142
00:57:07.216 --> 00:57:08.424
Come on...

1143
00:57:10.054 --> 00:57:11.526
Damn it! Hello?

1144
00:57:11.957 --> 00:57:13.121
Bill. are you there?

1145
00:57:13.893 --> 00:57:14.859
Commander Barnes?

1146
00:57:15.961 --> 00:57:18.093
[static]

1147
00:57:18.667 --> 00:57:19.831
Commander Barnes. over.

1148
00:57:20.636 --> 00:57:21.602
Snow?

1149
00:57:22.198 --> 00:57:23.439
Ford. fix this radio.

1150
00:57:29.744 --> 00:57:30.977
Listen to me!

1151
00:57:31.012 --> 00:57:34.879
If you can hear me. the two PTs
that were carrying commandos

1152
00:57:34.914 --> 00:57:36.848
for the assault were damaged
by Nazi fighters

1153
00:57:36.883 --> 00:57:37.782
and had to turn back.

1154
00:57:38.555 --> 00:57:40.522
If you reach that beach.
you are going to be

1155
00:57:40.557 --> 00:57:42.920
sitting ducks for those 88s.
Do you copy?

1156
00:57:43.890 --> 00:57:47.595
Snow. you need to pull back!
Hello?

1157
00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:48.662
Give me that!

1158
00:57:48.697 --> 00:57:49.828
God...

1159
00:57:50.964 --> 00:57:52.897
Snow. you need to get
the hell outta there. right now.

1160
00:57:52.932 --> 00:57:53.931
You understand?

1161
00:57:56.265 --> 00:57:57.869
Lieutenant. can you hear me?

1162
00:58:00.709 --> 00:58:03.578
Lieutenant. you need
to pull back immediately!

1163
00:58:04.614 --> 00:58:05.712
Do you read?

1164
00:58:09.883 --> 00:58:12.818
He better not blow that.
You understand?

1165
00:58:12.853 --> 00:58:15.051
There's 10.000 lives at risk.

1166
00:58:15.086 --> 00:58:16.151
Yes. General.

1167
00:58:16.186 --> 00:58:17.757
Keep trying.

1168
00:58:18.628 --> 00:58:20.254
You better get
these goddamn coms working

1169
00:58:20.289 --> 00:58:21.596
one way or the other.
You hear me?

1170
00:58:21.631 --> 00:58:22.630
Yes. sir.

1171
00:58:23.866 --> 00:58:26.766
Well. men. sounds like this
is the end of the line for us.

1172
00:58:30.035 --> 00:58:31.265
You heard the man's orders.

1173
00:58:32.004 --> 00:58:33.234
I didn't hear a thing.

1174
00:58:35.579 --> 00:58:38.074
We had some kind of radio
malfunction. Mr. Snow.

1175
00:58:38.648 --> 00:58:40.010
I didn't hear nothin'.
did you. fellas?

1176
00:58:40.045 --> 00:58:42.045
I didn't hear nothin'.
Irish?

1177
00:58:42.883 --> 00:58:45.950
I tried to fix it. but
you know me. all thumbs.

1178
00:58:45.985 --> 00:58:48.887
That last Luftwaffe attack must
have knocked out the radio.

1179
00:58:48.922 --> 00:58:49.921
It's been dead ever since.

1180
00:58:52.288 --> 00:58:53.760
Don't look at me.

1181
00:58:53.795 --> 00:58:55.531
My hearing's shot from
all those depth charges.

1182
00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:57.533
All right. men.

1183
00:58:57.997 --> 00:58:59.062
Prepare for deployment.

1184
00:59:00.934 --> 00:59:01.933
We're about to invade Italy.

1185
00:59:02.298 --> 00:59:03.935
[laughing]

1186
00:59:06.203 --> 00:59:07.741
Let's get outta here.

1187
00:59:14.948 --> 00:59:18.147
Our mission. gentlemen. is to
take out two German 88mm guns

1188
00:59:18.182 --> 00:59:22.789
and the location is right here.

1189
00:59:23.759 --> 00:59:26.661
About 50 yards south
is another German encampment

1190
00:59:26.696 --> 00:59:28.729
comprised of about 40 men.

1191
00:59:28.764 --> 00:59:31.259
Then to the north of
that is an encampment

1192
00:59:31.294 --> 00:59:33.701
much smaller between
five and 10 men.

1193
00:59:34.066 --> 00:59:35.736
If we reveal our position.

1194
00:59:36.068 --> 00:59:38.904
they have enough fire power
to blow us sky high.

1195
00:59:38.939 --> 00:59:41.643
That's why we plan
to land here.

1196
00:59:41.678 --> 00:59:43.271
keeping the Evans safe
from harm.

1197
00:59:43.306 --> 00:59:47.341
Now from here. you'll work
your way down to the guns.

1198
00:59:47.376 --> 00:59:49.618
Stealth is of the
utmost importance

1199
00:59:49.653 --> 00:59:51.983
as you approach the encampment
north of the 88s.

1200
00:59:52.986 --> 00:59:54.920
You'll need to take
out the first gun.

1201
00:59:54.955 --> 00:59:57.021
Then what's most important

1202
00:59:57.056 --> 01:00:00.255
is these men south of it
in this foxhole.

1203
01:00:01.423 --> 01:00:05.667
After killing these men as
quietly and quickly as possible.

1204
01:00:05.702 --> 01:00:08.197
you can then proceed
to destroy the last gun

1205
01:00:08.232 --> 01:00:11.739
before returning to
the ship for cake and soda.

1206
01:00:13.138 --> 01:00:14.676
Any questions?

1207
01:00:14.711 --> 01:00:15.710
No. sir.

1208
01:00:15.746 --> 01:00:17.778
I have to admit I'd say
that's the craziest plan

1209
01:00:17.813 --> 01:00:19.241
I've ever heard.

1210
01:00:21.311 --> 01:00:22.684
He's right.

1211
01:00:24.116 --> 01:00:25.115
Let's go win a war.

1212
01:00:35.424 --> 01:00:38.425
We want this short and sweet.
Got it?

1213
01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:39.833
We're here to take out those 88s

1214
01:00:39.868 --> 01:00:41.868
and we only got
45 minutes to do it!

1215
01:00:42.772 --> 01:00:45.201
So we want as little interaction
with the enemy as possible.

1216
01:00:45.236 --> 01:00:48.776
The last thing I wanna see is
an entire unit of Germans!

1217
01:00:48.811 --> 01:00:49.876
Are you with me?

1218
01:00:49.911 --> 01:00:51.372
-Ready and willing. sir!
-Good.

1219
01:00:51.407 --> 01:00:53.176
Now here's some cold hard facts.

1220
01:00:53.783 --> 01:00:56.212
If I hear sustained fire
coming from the beach.

1221
01:00:56.819 --> 01:00:58.247
I have no choice
but to withdraw.

1222
01:00:58.282 --> 01:00:59.281
Do you understand?

1223
01:00:59.855 --> 01:01:00.721
You got it. sir!

1224
01:01:00.756 --> 01:01:02.889
This girl can't withstand
one more hit

1225
01:01:02.924 --> 01:01:05.056
and I can't risk
the rest of the fellas.

1226
01:01:05.091 --> 01:01:07.223
Remember. you've got
thousands

1227
01:01:07.258 --> 01:01:09.060
of American and British
troops on their way.

1228
01:01:10.195 --> 01:01:13.295
So if you get in any trouble.
boys. fight like hell.

1229
01:01:13.330 --> 01:01:14.835
Help's coming. all right?

1230
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:15.902
Aye. Skip!

1231
01:01:15.937 --> 01:01:16.936
Let's go fight a war!

1232
01:01:17.466 --> 01:01:18.699
-Hey. Marca?
-Sir?

1233
01:01:18.734 --> 01:01:21.435
Brew a pot of coffee. We're
gonna need it when we get back.

1234
01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:22.909
Yes. sir. with cream.

1235
01:01:24.473 --> 01:01:25.681
Lower the boat!

1236
01:01:37.222 --> 01:01:38.452
We're about ashore now.

1237
01:01:52.105 --> 01:01:53.236
Are you sure they're
still asleep?

1238
01:01:55.911 --> 01:01:57.471
They are. sailor.

1239
01:01:58.243 --> 01:01:59.341
Better stay frosty.

1240
01:02:04.513 --> 01:02:06.249
It's awfully quiet out there.

1241
01:02:11.993 --> 01:02:14.092
All right. guys.
get ready to disembark.

1242
01:02:14.523 --> 01:02:16.127
Keep your head down.
you stay low.

1243
01:02:35.852 --> 01:02:37.313
Moose and Snider. you're gonna
take that north tower.

1244
01:02:37.348 --> 01:02:38.479
You're going to take
the satchels.

1245
01:02:38.514 --> 01:02:40.085
Bauer and I are
going to take the south.

1246
01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:41.922
We meet back here.
Keep your head down low.

1247
01:02:41.957 --> 01:02:43.418
-Go!
-Aye. Skip.

1248
01:02:49.426 --> 01:02:52.130
General. with our coms down
and knowing Lieutenant Snow.

1249
01:02:52.165 --> 01:02:54.363
I have to assume he
and his crew are proceeding

1250
01:02:54.398 --> 01:02:56.002
with the original plan.

1251
01:02:56.334 --> 01:02:58.070
If the Lawton B. Evans
is detected.

1252
01:02:58.105 --> 01:03:00.039
it could compromise
the entire mission.

1253
01:03:00.074 --> 01:03:01.304
Not if we take out those guns.

1254
01:03:02.879 --> 01:03:03.911
What are you talking about?

1255
01:03:03.946 --> 01:03:05.145
With those 88s out of the way.

1256
01:03:05.181 --> 01:03:07.849
you can still establish that
Salerno beachhead as planned.

1257
01:03:07.884 --> 01:03:10.819
Barnes. I've gotta get
10.000 Allied forces

1258
01:03:10.854 --> 01:03:13.547
onto this beachhead!
Do you understand that?

1259
01:03:13.582 --> 01:03:15.153
-Yes. sir.
-Huh?

1260
01:03:15.485 --> 01:03:17.419
And you think I wanna gamble
it with some cowboys

1261
01:03:17.454 --> 01:03:19.289
in a cargo ship who think
they can pull off

1262
01:03:19.324 --> 01:03:22.556
some commando raid against
an elite S.S. unit?

1263
01:03:22.591 --> 01:03:23.865
Is that what you think?

1264
01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:26.164
10.000 men at risk!

1265
01:03:26.595 --> 01:03:28.133
You think
they can pull that off?

1266
01:03:28.465 --> 01:03:29.464
Yes. sir.

1267
01:03:32.876 --> 01:03:34.205
I'm calling off the invasion.

1268
01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:35.470
General. please!

1269
01:03:36.572 --> 01:03:38.209
You gotta trust me on this.

1270
01:03:40.081 --> 01:03:41.410
Listen to me.

1271
01:03:41.445 --> 01:03:43.478
Snow and I go way back.

1272
01:03:43.513 --> 01:03:45.117
He is a hell of a skipper.

1273
01:03:45.152 --> 01:03:47.284
And if these boys say
they can get it done.

1274
01:03:47.319 --> 01:03:49.055
then. by God.
they'll get it done!

1275
01:03:50.894 --> 01:03:52.355
We're not out of this. sir.

1276
01:04:01.971 --> 01:04:03.333
Get me General Donahue.

1277
01:04:06.976 --> 01:04:08.470
If Snow and his men
don't take those guns out.

1278
01:04:08.505 --> 01:04:10.505
it's gonna be your ass.

1279
01:04:11.244 --> 01:04:13.079
The Germans will never
know what hit 'em. sir.

1280
01:05:11.535 --> 01:05:13.909
[urinating]

1281
01:05:43.171 --> 01:05:44.940
[chuckling]

1282
01:06:12.233 --> 01:06:13.595
Grenade.

[gunfire]

1284
01:06:39.128 --> 01:06:40.391
What's the plan. Skip?

1285
01:06:40.426 --> 01:06:42.690
Prep your gun.
We're moving in.

1286
01:06:42.725 --> 01:06:44.494
By the time we're in range
of those 88s.

1287
01:06:44.529 --> 01:06:47.134
the dynamite will have blown
them to kingdom come.

1288
01:06:47.829 --> 01:06:49.532
All men to general quarters!

1289
01:06:49.831 --> 01:06:51.402
All men to
general quarters!

1290
01:06:51.437 --> 01:06:53.503
Say again. all men
to general quarters!

1291
01:06:53.538 --> 01:06:55.010
[piping]

1292
01:07:37.450 --> 01:07:38.581
Is it set?

1293
01:07:40.453 --> 01:07:41.485
Let's move! Let's move!

1294
01:08:30.371 --> 01:08:31.436
[explosion]

1295
01:08:32.405 --> 01:08:33.768
That ought to slow them
Germans down a little.

1296
01:08:34.871 --> 01:08:36.771
Sir. it looks like they just
took out one of the 88s.

1297
01:08:36.806 --> 01:08:38.509
Waiting for visual
confirmation on the second.

1298
01:08:39.908 --> 01:08:40.774
You guys get yours set?

1299
01:08:40.809 --> 01:08:42.348
Yeah.
It should have gone off by now.

1300
01:08:42.713 --> 01:08:43.778
This ain't good.

1301
01:08:44.747 --> 01:08:45.613
The fuse must have got wet.
I'm going back.

1302
01:08:45.648 --> 01:08:47.254
-Stay here.
-No. Skip. it's too late!

1303
01:08:47.289 --> 01:08:49.388
[gunfire. shouting]

1304
01:08:50.457 --> 01:08:51.522
-I got ya. buddy.
-I'm hit!

1305
01:08:51.557 --> 01:08:52.754
Come on!

1306
01:08:56.826 --> 01:08:58.265
Got eyes. Bauer?

1307
01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:00.663
I got you.

1308
01:09:02.634 --> 01:09:04.766
Sir. I got two Germans up
on the ridge. 12:00.

1309
01:09:05.703 --> 01:09:07.868
Take one on the right.
I take the one on the left.

1310
01:09:07.903 --> 01:09:08.902
On three.

1311
01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:11.608
One. two. three!

1312
01:09:16.318 --> 01:09:17.680
-I got him!
-Nice shot.

1313
01:09:26.493 --> 01:09:28.163
Why is it so quiet?

1314
01:09:29.826 --> 01:09:31.166
Maybe they've fallen back.

1315
01:09:32.796 --> 01:09:33.828
Maybe we scared 'em off.

1316
01:09:33.863 --> 01:09:35.363
[airplane engine approaching]

1317
01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:41.176
Incoming Messerschmitts. sir!

1318
01:09:41.574 --> 01:09:43.376
Man the 50mm. Irish.

1319
01:09:43.411 --> 01:09:45.411
Me. sir?
I'm an engineer!

1320
01:09:45.446 --> 01:09:47.281
Make those Nazis
pay the price for

1321
01:09:47.316 --> 01:09:49.217
taking on the best damn
gunners in the U.S. Navy.

1322
01:09:49.483 --> 01:09:51.186
Yes. sir!

1323
01:09:52.519 --> 01:09:53.752
You guys hear that?

1324
01:09:53.787 --> 01:09:56.950
You know how in "King Kong"
when all the dinosaurs run away

1325
01:09:56.985 --> 01:09:58.919
because they hear
the giant ape coming?

1326
01:09:58.954 --> 01:10:00.459
Yeah.

1327
01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:03.858
Sounds like they got
their giant ape.

1328
01:10:03.893 --> 01:10:04.991
Messerschmitts!

1329
01:10:05.026 --> 01:10:06.432
Get down.

1330
01:10:13.969 --> 01:10:15.342
It's coming back around!

1331
01:10:15.806 --> 01:10:17.839
All right. boys.
might as well go out fighting.

1332
01:10:17.874 --> 01:10:19.313
Got enough ammo?

1333
01:10:19.348 --> 01:10:20.446
Enough for a couple minutes.

1334
01:10:20.481 --> 01:10:21.975
It ain't gonna last that long.

1335
01:10:22.516 --> 01:10:23.548
Ready?

1336
01:10:24.419 --> 01:10:25.418
Now!

1337
01:10:34.825 --> 01:10:36.495
Woo!

1338
01:10:40.567 --> 01:10:41.929
Light 'em up. fellas!

1339
01:10:41.964 --> 01:10:44.767
Leave no stone unturned
or Nazi unshot!

1341

Fire at will!

01:10:52.777 --> 01:10:55.613
Moose? I'm not gonna
lose anymore guys.

1343
01:10:55.648 --> 01:10:56.944
Get Moose up!
Let's get outta here!

1344
01:10:57.551 --> 01:10:58.682
Take him to the shore.

1345
01:10:58.717 --> 01:11:00.013
-Come on.
-Come on. Buddy.

1346
01:11:00.785 --> 01:11:03.390
Come on. Come on. come on.

1347
01:11:04.492 --> 01:11:05.920
All right.

1348
01:11:07.891 --> 01:11:09.891
Ready to get your ass beat
in another game of chess?

1349
01:11:11.334 --> 01:11:13.532
Remind me who won...

1350
01:11:14.634 --> 01:11:15.798
You two can't quit.

1351
01:11:16.372 --> 01:11:18.504
Didn't count. last time.

1352
01:11:18.869 --> 01:11:19.934
It's a rematch.

1353
01:11:23.038 --> 01:11:25.346
Prepare for that high
elevation shot!

1354
01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:26.677
You got it!
You got it!

Come on! We got Messerschmitts
coming in hot!

That's what I'm talking about!

1362
01:12:05.454 --> 01:12:07.751
Holy cow!
I got one!

1363
01:12:07.786 --> 01:12:09.016
Did you see that?

1364
01:12:09.051 --> 01:12:11.458
Paul. Jacob!
Get in there. help him.

1365
01:12:11.493 --> 01:12:12.690
He's shot!
Watch his leg!

1367
01:12:14.892 --> 01:12:17.123
Lt. Snow. there's still
one 88 remaining!

I've been better.

Come on. come on.

01:12:37.046 --> 01:12:38.452
-Drop that gun!
-Orozco!

1376

Are you ready to
get back in the fight?

-Can I kill Nazis?
-I hope so!

1378
01:12:41.886 --> 01:12:42.984
Where do I sign. sir?

1379
01:12:43.019 --> 01:12:44.491
Man the 20mm!

1380
01:12:44.526 --> 01:12:47.021

I'm about to kill some of them!

1381
01:12:52.666 --> 01:12:54.094
Let's go. let's go. let's go!

1382
01:12:57.165 --> 01:12:58.868
Give me something to shoot at!

fire at the coastline.

Get some ammo!

That was too close for comfort.

1402
01:14:06.971 --> 01:14:08.971
We have to take out
that last 88!

1403
01:14:09.809 --> 01:14:10.973
I'm sorry. sir.

1404
01:14:11.239 --> 01:14:14.042
My gunner trainer.
Grovener. he's dead.

1405
01:14:14.077 --> 01:14:15.549
Can you please take
the point of position?

1406
01:14:15.584 --> 01:14:16.913
Copy that. seaman.

1407
01:14:21.117 --> 01:14:22.688
Time for some
revenge killing.

1408
01:14:26.122 --> 01:14:27.825
I got you. sir.

1409
01:14:30.995 --> 01:14:32.698
[shouting]

1410
01:14:41.742 --> 01:14:42.873
All right!

1411
01:14:42.908 --> 01:14:44.237
On my command...

1412
01:14:44.877 --> 01:14:46.679
Time for that
revenge killing. sir!

1413
01:14:48.111 --> 01:14:49.748
Five degrees starboard!

1414
01:14:49.783 --> 01:14:51.717
Yes. sir!
Five degrees starboard!

1415
01:14:53.622 --> 01:14:56.018
Let's kill those Nazi bastards.

1416
01:14:56.053 --> 01:14:57.954
On target. sir.

1417
01:14:57.989 --> 01:15:00.154
And... fire!

1418
01:15:00.189 --> 01:15:01.155
Fire!

1419
01:15:10.166 --> 01:15:11.836
Oh!

1420
01:15:11.871 --> 01:15:12.936
Yes. yes!

1421
01:15:12.971 --> 01:15:14.168
[shouting]

1422
01:15:16.271 --> 01:15:17.270
We got 'em!

1423
01:15:19.615 --> 01:15:21.274
Way to go. Cap. way to go!

1424
01:15:21.914 --> 01:15:23.782
Oh. yeah!

1425
01:15:24.279 --> 01:15:26.653
That was one in
a million. Captain!

1426
01:15:27.623 --> 01:15:29.018
You happy now. asshole?

1427
01:15:29.856 --> 01:15:31.053
Thank you so much. sir.

1428
01:15:31.924 --> 01:15:33.055
Grovener would have loved that.

1429
01:15:34.322 --> 01:15:35.794
Grovener.

1430
01:15:47.071 --> 01:15:49.544
I guess we invaded Italy
after all. huh. buddy?

1431
01:15:59.952 --> 01:16:01.017
Not bad for a cargo ship.

1432
01:16:01.052 --> 01:16:02.887
You're a hell of a shot. Skip.

1433
01:16:03.384 --> 01:16:05.692
The way we're listing.
we're not gonna last 20 minutes.

1434
01:16:06.893 --> 01:16:09.322
Well then. let's make it count.

1435
01:16:13.834 --> 01:16:15.295
[gunfire]

1436
01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:18.936
Pleasure to serving
with you. Mr. Ford.

1437
01:16:18.971 --> 01:16:20.036
Pleasure's all mine. sir.

1438
01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:29.848
Messerschmitt coming in!

1439
01:16:29.883 --> 01:16:31.113
[shouts]

1440
01:16:33.854 --> 01:16:35.821
[shouts]

1441
01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:37.019
Nice shot. Irish.

1442
01:16:37.055 --> 01:16:38.989
-Thank you. sir.
-You ought to be a gunner.

1443
01:16:44.997 --> 01:16:47.030
[shouts]

1444
01:16:47.065 --> 01:16:49.131
Flight coming in!
Whoa. whoa. whoa!

1445
01:16:50.871 --> 01:16:51.936
Ah!

1446
01:16:51.971 --> 01:16:54.367
I got shot in the ass!

1447
01:16:59.242 --> 01:17:00.307
Ah!

1448
01:17:00.342 --> 01:17:02.980
Medic!
Bring some morphine!

1449
01:17:03.015 --> 01:17:05.081
Medic! Medic...

1450
01:17:05.116 --> 01:17:06.313
I got you.

1451
01:17:06.348 --> 01:17:07.820
-Morphine.
-Stay calm. stay calm.

1452
01:17:07.855 --> 01:17:09.085
I'm always calm!

1453
01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:10.350
I'll put pressure
on the wound.

1454
01:17:10.385 --> 01:17:12.022
Hey. hey!
Get your hand off my ass!

1455
01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:14.255
Stay calm. Cookie.
I just gotta stop the bleeding.

1456
01:17:14.290 --> 01:17:15.762
All right.

1457
01:17:15.797 --> 01:17:17.027
Tell me the truth.

1458
01:17:17.062 --> 01:17:18.193
Am I ever gonna shit again?

1459
01:17:18.228 --> 01:17:19.392
Not with this butt.

1460
01:17:19.427 --> 01:17:23.770
Oh. I had such
a pretty butt too.

1461
01:17:23.805 --> 01:17:25.332
Looks like hamburger now.

1462
01:17:26.005 --> 01:17:28.709
Chorizo!
Say chorizo. cabrón.

1463
01:17:28.744 --> 01:17:29.875
Okay. chorizo.

1464
01:17:31.175 --> 01:17:32.680
It hurts!

1465
01:17:38.281 --> 01:17:39.379
Coming back!

1466
01:17:39.414 --> 01:17:41.183
Good luck!

1467
01:17:46.157 --> 01:17:47.354
Where'd that come from?

1468
01:17:47.389 --> 01:17:49.158
Wait! What's that?

1469
01:17:49.897 --> 01:17:53.327
Skip. look! It's our boys.
come for the invasion!

1470
01:17:54.803 --> 01:17:57.001
Woo! Yeah!

1471
01:18:00.743 --> 01:18:03.942
[cheering]

1472
01:18:03.977 --> 01:18:05.207
USA. baby!

1473
01:18:13.921 --> 01:18:15.756
Well. I guess I figured
I didn't have a choice.

1474
01:18:15.791 --> 01:18:17.285
That's no excuse. Lieutenant.

1475
01:18:17.958 --> 01:18:19.386
You were given a direct order
to stand down

1476
01:18:19.421 --> 01:18:21.454
when you attacked
those Kraut guns.

1477
01:18:21.489 --> 01:18:23.357
You put American lives
at risk.

1478
01:18:24.063 --> 01:18:25.095
Yes. sir.
It's entirely my fault.

1479
01:18:25.130 --> 01:18:26.294
I take full--

1480
01:18:26.329 --> 01:18:28.868
Damn right!
That was your fault.

1481
01:18:28.903 --> 01:18:31.101
We didn't have enough gas to
make it back to base. sir. so--

1482
01:18:31.136 --> 01:18:32.938
You chose to engage the enemy

1483
01:18:32.973 --> 01:18:34.940
in direct violation
of my orders.

1484
01:18:34.975 --> 01:18:38.108
We knew how important those 88s
were to German defenses. sir.

1485
01:18:38.143 --> 01:18:41.848
Did you or did you not receive
my instructions

1486
01:18:41.883 --> 01:18:43.850
to steer clear of the enemy
until further notice?

1487
01:18:44.215 --> 01:18:46.248
Um. yes and no.

1488
01:18:48.516 --> 01:18:50.417
Yes or no. Lieutenant?

1489
01:18:50.991 --> 01:18:52.221
Yes. sir.

1490
01:18:52.553 --> 01:18:54.289
Now you listen carefully and you
listen good

1491
01:18:54.324 --> 01:18:56.456
because
I'm only gonna say this once.

1492
01:18:57.129 --> 01:18:59.393
Although I'm tempted to
court martial your ass.

1493
01:19:00.132 --> 01:19:02.132
that was one of
the most brilliantly executed

1494
01:19:02.167 --> 01:19:04.838
commando raids
I've ever heard of.

1495
01:19:05.973 --> 01:19:08.336
And I've been in
this game a long. long time.

1496
01:19:08.371 --> 01:19:09.876
Thank you. sir.

1497
01:19:09.911 --> 01:19:12.076
Snow. if you ever disobey
an order of mine again.

1498
01:19:12.111 --> 01:19:14.012
I'll have your ass in a sling.

1499
01:19:14.883 --> 01:19:18.951
Having said that. and I can't
endorse that behavior...

1500
01:19:19.954 --> 01:19:22.383
we will now be in Rome
in less than a week.

1501
01:19:23.584 --> 01:19:25.419
Anything we can do to help. sir?

1502
01:19:26.488 --> 01:19:27.894
I don't know much. Lieutenant.

1503
01:19:29.095 --> 01:19:30.523
but I do know that the U.S. Navy
is gonna need

1504
01:19:30.558 --> 01:19:33.262
some top-notch commanders if
we're gonna beat the Japanese.

1505
01:19:34.001 --> 01:19:35.267
Yes. sir.

1506
01:19:35.303 --> 01:19:38.234
Do you think you could command
a heavy cruiser in the Pacific?

1507
01:19:39.908 --> 01:19:41.006
Sir...

1508
01:19:41.041 --> 01:19:42.172
We'll be in touch. Lieutenant.

1509
01:19:45.573 --> 01:19:47.045
We're doing okay.

1510
01:19:56.485 --> 01:19:58.892
They're calling the invasion
"Operation Avalanche."

1511
01:20:00.027 --> 01:20:01.191
I like that.

1512
01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:04.359
The doc says they're gonna
be sending you home. Moose.

1513
01:20:04.394 --> 01:20:05.593
What do you think?

1514
01:20:05.629 --> 01:20:07.560
You mean. you'd have to pull
your own weight for a change?

1515
01:20:07.595 --> 01:20:10.002
I don't like it
any more than you do.

1516
01:20:10.565 --> 01:20:14.534
"The U.S. Fifth Army. working in
coordination with the British.

1517
01:20:14.569 --> 01:20:16.470
who landed a division in
Taranto."

1518
01:20:18.177 --> 01:20:19.374
Throw in the fact
that Italy surrendered.

1519
01:20:19.409 --> 01:20:22.146
and this is big.
very. very big.

1520
01:20:22.181 --> 01:20:23.147
Ow.

1521
01:20:25.085 --> 01:20:27.250
All right. Moose.
see you in the funny papers!

1522
01:20:27.285 --> 01:20:28.922
Aye. aye. you betcha!

1523
01:20:29.353 --> 01:20:31.089
Hey. Cookie. wait!

1524
01:20:31.619 --> 01:20:34.587
Just. you know. in case you
get in another scrape.

1525
01:20:35.458 --> 01:20:37.062
You know me too well. Irish!

1526
01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:46.137
Hey. Bauer. Ford wants
to see you in the wardroom.

1527
01:20:46.172 --> 01:20:47.369
What does that jerk want?

1528
01:20:48.977 --> 01:20:50.207
Ask him yourself.

1529
01:21:01.253 --> 01:21:02.085
Marca said you--

1530
01:21:02.121 --> 01:21:03.517
You ever heard of
knocking. sailor?

1531
01:21:06.291 --> 01:21:07.389
Sorry. sir.

1532
01:21:08.656 --> 01:21:09.963
[knocking]

1533
01:21:09.998 --> 01:21:11.261
Come in.

1534
01:21:13.265 --> 01:21:15.067
Marca said you wanted
to see me. sir?

1535
01:21:15.531 --> 01:21:17.168
Bauer. Bauer.

1536
01:21:18.006 --> 01:21:20.402
Oh. yeah. Run those charts
up to the skipper

1537
01:21:20.437 --> 01:21:21.535
on the bridge for me. would you?

1538
01:21:25.310 --> 01:21:26.342
Seriously?

1539
01:21:26.982 --> 01:21:28.113
Yes. seriously.

1540
01:21:35.584 --> 01:21:37.023
It's all yours. Bauer.

1541
01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:40.158
Yes. sir!
It's...

1542
01:21:40.963 --> 01:21:42.424
It's beautiful!

1543
01:21:43.361 --> 01:21:44.998
I knew you were gonna piss me
off at some point.

1544
01:21:45.033 --> 01:21:47.000
But I didn't want you
to be without a fishing rod.

1545
01:21:47.035 --> 01:21:48.364
so... you know.

1546
01:21:50.566 --> 01:21:52.104
This doesn't mean
we're friends now. does it?

1547
01:21:52.535 --> 01:21:54.909
Don't get carried away...
get out of here.

1548
01:21:57.177 --> 01:21:58.440
Hey. shut the door!

1549
01:21:58.475 --> 01:22:00.277
Sorry. sir.
Thank you again. sir.

1550
01:22:00.312 --> 01:22:01.509
Oh. my God.

1551
01:22:14.062 --> 01:22:15.556
[crying]

1552
01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:22.662
I'm gonna miss your
philosophy lessons. Ken.

1553
01:22:25.205 --> 01:22:26.941
I got a little something
for you

1554
01:22:29.143 --> 01:22:31.605
just in case you get stuck
with a pair of sixes.

1555
01:22:55.334 --> 01:22:57.037
She all battened down?

1556
01:22:57.072 --> 01:22:59.105
She's not sinking anymore.

1557
01:22:59.734 --> 01:23:00.733
Small victories.

1558
01:23:03.111 --> 01:23:04.242
How you holding up?

1559
01:23:05.411 --> 01:23:08.114
Well. luckily. I wasn't killed.
only slightly injured.

1560
01:23:11.482 --> 01:23:13.746
Grovener was one hell
of a sailor. wasn't he?

1561
01:23:14.650 --> 01:23:15.748
One of the best.

1562
01:23:15.783 --> 01:23:16.991
Yeah.

1563
01:23:18.027 --> 01:23:19.455
Right or wrong.
when you're captain of the ship.

1564
01:23:20.722 --> 01:23:21.588
you have to make decisions

1565
01:23:21.623 --> 01:23:23.558
where men's lives
hang in the balance.

1566
01:23:24.528 --> 01:23:25.725
It just has to be that way.

1567
01:23:28.136 --> 01:23:29.663
That was no accident
those thunderbolts

1568
01:23:29.698 --> 01:23:30.731
had their way with the Germans.

1569
01:23:31.502 --> 01:23:33.634
The enemy had those 88s.
that wouldn't have happened.

1570
01:23:33.669 --> 01:23:35.075
That was your doing. Skip.

1571
01:23:35.803 --> 01:23:37.374
Suppose it was.

1572
01:23:40.082 --> 01:23:41.312
You think these
actions are gonna get you

1573
01:23:41.347 --> 01:23:42.775
back on a warship
where you belong?

1574
01:23:45.153 --> 01:23:46.548
Well. if it does.

1575
01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:50.288
would you care to be
my second in command?

1576
01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:54.358
And miss running fruits
