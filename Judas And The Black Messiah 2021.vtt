00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Keep it rolling.
we'll just get. like.

2
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Could somebody
wipe him down?

3
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Eyes on the Prize 2.
March 3rd. 1989...

4
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Bill O'Neal interview.

5
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Looking back
on your activities

6
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
what would you tell your son
about what you did then?

7
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Look at them flames
Lightin' up the sky

8
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Shootin' up so high

9
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Look at them flames
Lightin' up the sky

10
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Look at them flames
Lighting up the sky

11
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
shooting up so high

12
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
To what I'm sayin'?

13
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Like them niggas

14
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Them niggas
Ain't playin'

15
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Them niggas
Ain't playin'

16
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Them niggas
Ain't playin'

17
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Those are not riots.
those are rebellions.

18
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
People are rebelling
because of conditions.

19
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and not because of individuals.

20
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
No individual
creates a rebellion.

21
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
It's created
out of the conditions.

22
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Revolution
Is the only solution

23
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Is the only solution

24
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Revolution
Is the only solution

25
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Okay. Who is this?

26
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Huey P. Newton.

27
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And where is Huey?

28
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
In jail.

29
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
The first thing
that the Black Panther Party

30
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
in Oakland. was to set up
an armed patrol

31
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
in order to ensure

32
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
that Black people were not
harassed and intimidated

33
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
by the local police department.

34
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And if the police
arrested the individual.

35
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
we'd follow him to the jail
and bail the individual out.

36
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
whether he was
a Panther or not.

37
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Panthers are the vanguard. man.

38
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
We're talking
about tearing shit down

39
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
startin' at the bottom.
goin' up.

40
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
A non-capitalistic state.
That's what

41
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Yeah. we armed.
We a armed propaganda union.

42
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
but we spend most of our time
working with these programs

43
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
serving the people.

44
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Free medical clinic.

45
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
free breakfast
children program.

46
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
the inter-communal institute
in liberation schools.

47
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
free legal aid.
education for the community.

48
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
The Black Panthers

49
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
are the single greatest threat
to our national security.

50
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
More than the Chinese.
Even more than the Russians.

51
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Our counter-intelligence
program

52
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
must prevent the rise
of a Black Messiah

53
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
from among their midst.

54
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
One with a potential
to unite the Communist.

55
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
the anti-war.
and the New Left movements.

56
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
We don't fight fire with fire.
we fight fire with water.

57
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
This man.

58
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
You don't fight racism
with racism. We gonna fight

59
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Fredrick Allen Hampton.

60
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
We ain't gonna fight capitalism
with Black capitalism.

61
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
we gonna fight capitalism
with socialism.

62
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Fuckin' Crowns. Of course.

63
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
All right.
playtime's over.

64
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Everybody grab
a fucking wall.

65
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
What the hell is this?
I just paid O'Mally last week.

66
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
You hear me?

67
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Do I look like some
two-bit shakedown artist

68
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
What the fuck does this say?
The initials.

69
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
FBI?

70
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
FBI. that's right. big guy.

71
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Hey. where you going?
Come back here. clown.

73
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Come here!

74
00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Man. we in here mindin'
our own business.

75
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000
We ain't doin' nothin'
to nobody.

76
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Yeah. yeah. yeah.
spread 'em open.

77
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Fuck off me. pig.

78
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
What you got in there?

79
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Don't y'all motherfuckers

80
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Oh. you just minding your
fucking business. huh?

81
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
-What's this?
-

82
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
What's that? Fuckin' idiot.

83
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
I swear to God.
ain't no pig worse

84
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Little Pontiac. huh?
- All right. time out.

85
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000
All right. big man.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
What?
- Yep.

87
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
That GTO out there.

88
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
-the red one.
that belong to you?

89
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Well. it was reported stolen
two months ago.

90
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000
-Let's go. let's go.
Yep. Yep. yep.

91
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Hey. hey. hey!

92
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
-Let me go.
-Be easy. be easy. all right?

93
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
I got the papers on it
and everything.

94
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
You're under arrest
for grand theft auto.

95
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
-I didn't do nothin'!
-Yeah. yeah.

96
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Say. man.
what the fuck is the FBI doing

97
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Y'all ran out of niggas
to assassinate?

98
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
-

99
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
-Motherfucker.
- Shit!

100
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Hey. hey. hey. tough guy.
No wise eye.

101
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000
You be easy. right?
No funny eye.

102
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
He ain't nothin'
but a kid.

103
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
You ain't no fucking cop.
nigga.

104
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Stay the fuck back!

105
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000
-Get him!
-

106
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
-Get out the car!
- Fall back!

107
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
-

108
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Oh. shit!

109
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Get your ass out here!

110
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out of here!

111
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Get that out
of my fucking chest! Shit!

112
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Ahh!

113
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Get the fuck off my shit!

114
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
-

115
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
-Fuck off this shit!

116
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Punk motherfucker!

117
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Special Agent Mitchell.
FBI.

118
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Almost as spiffy as yours.

119
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Now. tell me. why the badge?

120
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Why not just use
a knife or a gun

121
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
A badge is scarier than a gun.

122
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Would you mind
explaining that for me?

123
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Any nigga on the streets
can get a gun...

124
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
A badge is like you got
the whole damn army

125
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
I better
hold on to this. then.

126
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Were you upset
when Dr. King was murdered?

127
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000
What?

128
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Were you upset
when Dr. King was murdered?

129
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
I don't know.

130
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
You can be honest.

131
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Well. I was a little bit. yeah.

132
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And what about Malcolm X?

133
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
I ain't ever thought
about all that.

134
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
You just never
thought about it?

135
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
No.

136
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
You're looking at 18 months
for the stolen car

137
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and five years
for impersonating

138
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Or you can go home.

139
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
...that reflected
the population

140
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
of the 80% Black student body.

141
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
So they're bringing in
Dr. Charles Hurst

142
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
from Howard University
to be president.

143
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And they're gonna call it
Malcolm X College from now on.

144
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
It's in this
spirit of activism.

145
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and on behalf of
the Wright Junior College

146
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
I am proud to introduce

147
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Deputy Chairman Fred Hampton
of the Illinois

148
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
I don't need no mic.
Can y'all hear me?

149
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Yeah!

150
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Right on.

151
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Malcolm X College.
I can dig it.

152
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Dr. Charles Hurst.
direct from Howard.

153
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
-

154
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
So. what?

155
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
You think
the students over there

156
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Oh. they'll let you change
the name of your college.

157
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
throw on a dashiki.
'Cause guess what?

158
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
They still gonna drag
your Black ass to Vietnam

159
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
to shoot a poor rice farmer
or get shot your damn self.

160
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
That's the difference
between revolution

161
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and the candy-coated facade
of gradual reform.

162
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Reform is just the masters
teaching the slaves

163
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
how to be better slaves.

164
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Under reform. you could take
the motherfucking masters out.

165
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and the slaves still be doin'
all the work for 'em.

166
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
There's a man
called a capitalist.

167
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Don't matter what color he is.
black. white. brown. red.

168
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Because the capitalist
has one goal.

169
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And that is
to exploit the people.

170
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
He can have on
a three-piece suit

171
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
'cause political power
doesn't flow

172
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Political power flows
from the barrel of a gun.

173
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
We in the Black Panther Party
don't believe in no culture

174
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
except revolutionary culture.

175
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
What we mean by that
is a culture

176
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Don't give me no five-and-dime
costume of a medicine man

177
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
or whatever you think
the motherland look like.

178
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Give me the righteous threads
of a Mozambican

179
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Give me... Give me a AK-47.

180
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
or some bandoliers
like they got in Angola!

181
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Give me some Colt .45s
for the folks that are

182
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Brother.

183
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000
A dashiki ain't gonna help you

184
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
when they come up
in here with them tanks

185
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
like they did in Henry Horner.

186
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
-You need tools. brother.
-

187
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
We got the tools
at 75th and Madison.

188
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Can you spare
a little change. brother?

189
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Sister. spare a little change?

190
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Hi.

191
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Evenin'.

192
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Thought your speech
was really interesting.

193
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Well. thank you. sister.

194
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Do you like poetry?

195
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
I mean. it's cool.
but as Che Guevara said...

196
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
"Words are beautiful.
but action is supreme."

197
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
I dig. Right on.

198
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000
But you were up on that stage
using words. so...

199
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Maybe next time.
choose 'em

200
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
instead of tearin' down
the folk

201
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000
who you call yourself
recruitin'.

202
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
just because they demonstrate
a little Black pride.

203
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
But just so you know.
you are a poet.

204
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Somebody
define war for me.

205
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
War is a violent conflict
between two or more parties.

206
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Would you say we at war
with the pigs. Comrade Palmer?

207
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Chairman. I'd take it
a step further and say

208
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
that every ghetto
across the nation

209
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000
should be considered
occupied territory.

210
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Right on.

211
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Well. how about politics?

212
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
How would you define politics.
Brother Winters?

213
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Uh...

214
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
You know. elections.

215
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Elections can be part
of politics. certainly.

216
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
But we in the party

217
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
ascribe to Chairman Mao's
definition of politics.

218
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
He said. "War is politics
with bloodshed.

219
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
and politics is war
without bloodshed."

220
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Say it with me. y'all.

221
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
"War is politics
with bloodshed.

222
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Politics is war
without bloodshed."

223
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Now. what that mean?

224
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
It mean every time
the pigs shoot down

225
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
an unarmed brother
or sister in the street.

226
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Mayor Daley pulled the trigger.

227
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
It mean Tricky Dicky Nixon

228
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
is the fattest.
most filthy pig in the pen.

229
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
So. how we win this war?

230
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
What's our most lethal weapon?

231
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Guns? Grenades?

232
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Rocket launchers?

233
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
These niggas
got rocket launchers?

234
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
There's strength
in numbers.

235
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Power anywhere there's people.

236
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
And in order to
overthrow this racist.

237
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
fascist. nefarious
U.S. government.

238
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Black Panther paper!
Free your mind

239
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Sorry. I'm on my way to work.

240
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Well. I'm at work. sister.
I work for you.

241
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Information is raw material
for new ideas.

242
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Oh. you got kids?

243
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
-Your friends got kids?
-Yeah.

244
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Well. we got
a breakfast program

245
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Because we've grown
so accustomed to being poor.

246
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
we think it's normal
for our kids

247
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
We think it's normal for us
to go to the hospital

248
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
and come home in a body bag.

249
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
So. our job
as the Black Panther Party

250
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
is to heighten
the contradictions.

251
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
I pledge allegiance...

252
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
I pledge allegiance...

253
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000
...to my Black people.

254
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
...to my Black people.

255
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
I pledge to develop...

256
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
I pledge to develop...

257
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
...my mind and body
to the greatest

258
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
...my mind and body
to the greatest

259
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
I will learn all that I can...

260
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
I will learn
all that I can...

261
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
...in order to give
my best to my people

262
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
...in order to give
my best to my people

263
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000
in the struggle for liberation.

264
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
So. the people can decide
if they wanna overthrow

265
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
or not.

266
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
These two people
are waiting to see you

267
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Also. Brother Cohran called.

268
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
He wanted to know
if you willing to speak

269
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
and somebody named
Stanley Uhuru

270
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
said he wanted to speak to you
about a credit union.

271
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000
What's that?

272
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
EKG machine.

273
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
For the clinic.
when we get it up and running.

274
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Mm-hmm.

275
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
The poet.
What a pleasant surprise.

276
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
I saw your ad in the paper
lookin' for a new speechwriter.

277
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
I figured I'd better
come lend a hand.

278
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Well. that must have
been a misprint.

279
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
See. I don't write speeches.
sister.

280
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
I just get up on stage
and speak truth

281
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Oh. it shows.
The lack of preparation.

282
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
It got you here.

283
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:31.000
"We want land. bread.
housing. education.

284
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
justice. and peace."

285
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
"Housing. justice. peace."

286
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Life. liberty. happiness.

287
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
I mean. it's all right there
in the Declaration

288
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
But when poor people demand it.
it's a contradiction.

289
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
It's not democracy.
it's socialism. dig?

290
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
We can
do something after this.

291
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000
O'Neal. stand up.

292
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
What is the party line
in regards to our sisters.

293
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Anybody?

294
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
"Do not take liberties

295
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Oh. come on now.
I ain't takin' no goddamn...

296
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
These aren't just your sisters.
They're your sisters-in-arms.

297
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Act like it.

298
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Twenty push-ups for discipline.

299
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Captain Harmon...

300
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
count 'em out.

301
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
What's wrong. O'Neal?

302
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Down to the ground!

303
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
-You scared of a little dirt?

304
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
I could have a sister
put a towel down for ya.

305
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
You ain't tell me
it was gonna be like this.

306
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
These motherfuckers
ain't no terrorists.

307
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Shit. they terrorizing me.

308
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
What can I do to help?

309
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
The goal is
to get close to Hampton.

310
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
What does he need

311
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:19.000
that maybe your Uncle Sam
might be able

312
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
A car.

313
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Fred don't drive no more.
'Cause the pigs always...

314
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Shit. the police.

315
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
-No. that's good.
-

316
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
You're becoming a Panther.

317
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
The pigs are always
followin' him around.

318
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
givin' him
bullshit traffic violations.

319
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
if you want me
to get close to Fred.

320
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
give me a car.

321
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Jimmy. come on. man.

322
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Say. Chairman.
that wasn't no goddamn pig

323
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
you was eatin' out there.
was it?

324
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Somebody gotta show the pig
who's boss. man.

325
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
All right.
y'all ready to split? Huh?

326
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Y'all got weapons?
Give 'em here.

327
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Now. Judy. you is out
of your rabbit-ass mind

328
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
if you don't get
your motherfuckin' boot

329
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Shit.

330
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Yo. Winters.
how many pistols you got. man?

331
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
What about you?

332
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Mine's in the glove box.
Motherfucker.

333
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Park as close to Leon's
as you can.

334
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
in case we gotta haul ass
outta there.

335
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Chairman.
that's the Crowns' pool hall.

336
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Exactly. Stay sharp.

337
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Hey. Chairman.
what are we doin' here?

338
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Getting
the Crowns' attention.

339
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Evenin'.
brothers and sisters.

340
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
I wanted to hip y'all to a new
free breakfast program

341
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
opening on the South Side
next week.

342
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Free for the babies.

343
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000
All you gotta do
is drop your little ones off

344
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
and we'll take care
of the rest.

345
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Stop on by to Saint Andrew's
and check us out.

346
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
And if you're on the West Side
or you got family

347
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
we at the Better Boys Club.
Monday through Friday.

348
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
The Illinois
Black Panther Party

349
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
to feed every hungry kid
in Chicago.

350
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
I'm not talkin' about
handing out turkeys

351
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
that's charity.

352
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Save that for the pushers
and the preachers

353
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
who call themselves
doin' you a favor

354
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Fuck charity.

355
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
The Black Panther Party
believes in progression.

356
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Now. what that mean?

357
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
That mean. first.
you have free breakfast.

358
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
then you have free healthcare.

359
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
then you have free education.

360
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Next thing you know.
you look up. you done freed

361
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Know where you at.
motherfucker?

362
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
This is Crowns territory.

363
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000
We don't want no trouble.
brother.

364
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
We just passin' through.

365
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Besides. the rap we on
is a political one.

366
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000
It shouldn't really
concern y'all.

367
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Nigga. don't lecture me
on politics.

368
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
The Crowns protected
Martin Luther King

369
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
And he got
his head split open.

370
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Damn near killed
by a mob of crackers

371
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Bang-up job y'all did.

372
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
Hey. hey. hey!
Get the fuck back!

373
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
Get the fuck back. nigga!
Back up!

374
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
-

375
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
No need for that. brother.

376
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
We on our way.

377
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000
But dig. I got a message
for the big man.

378
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Tell him the Panthers
wanna sit down

379
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
Imagine what we could
accomplish together.

380
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
You sure
you wanna go sit down

381
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000
Hell. yeah.

382
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Imagine the Panthers.
the Stones. the Crowns.

383
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
and the Disciples fighting
under one revolutionary army.

384
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Them pigs ain't ready for that.

385
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000
Shit.

386
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
I'll tell y'all one thing.

387
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
I'm bringin'
my motherfuckin' pistols

388
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
And you hear me. Chairman?
Shit.

389
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Maybe one of yours. too. nigga.

390
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
All you need
is a pool stick.

391
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
You see him swinging
that thing around?

392
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Hey. don't you
underestimate my skill.

393
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000
You got heart. Bill.

394
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
You wild. but you got heart.

395
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Wild Bill.

396
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Wild Bill! Wow! Wild Bill!

397
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Man. tell me
they ain't call you that

398
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Nah. man.
they ain't call me nothing.

399
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Nah?

400
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000
Shit. I mighta heard it
once or twice.

401
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
See. I knew it! I knew it!
Wild Bill!

402
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Yeah!
-

403
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
God damn it. Harmon.
you and these goddamn cognomen.

404
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000
Oh. man...
- Wild Bill!

405
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000
Pool stick to a gun fight. man.

406
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Come on in.
make yourself at home

407
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
This is Samantha.

408
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000
What made you think

409
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Uh. I'd rode around
in his car.

410
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
I had dinner with him
at his dinner table.

411
00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.000
Um... You know. he was.
at one point. for me.

412
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000
When I didn't have one.
you know?

413
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000
We had very few role models
back then.

414
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
We had Martin Luther King.
Malcolm X.

415
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
Muhammad Ali.

416
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
I had an FBI agent.

417
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
You know. I investigated
the Schwerner.

418
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000
down in Mississippi in '64.

419
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
You familiar?

420
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Well...

421
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
A couple kids was trying

422
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
to register Negroes to vote.
That's all they were doing.

423
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
They got arrested
on bogus speeding charges

424
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
by the sheriff's deputy.

425
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000
who hand-delivered them
to the Klan.

426
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
And they shot 'em. of course.

427
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Cut off Chaney's penis.

428
00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000
This.

429
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
what you and I are doing. is...

430
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
What?

431
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Is the other side of that coin.

432
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Don't let Hampton fool you.

433
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
The Panthers and the Klan
are one and the same.

434
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Their aim is to sow hatred

435
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
and inspire terror.

436
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
Plain and simple.

437
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000
Now. I'm all for civil rights.

438
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
but you can't cheat your way
to equality.

439
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
And you certainly
can't shoot your way to it.

440
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Yep.

441
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000
Anyway. I'm going to go
get those dogs going.

442
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
No. no. sit down.
You're a guest.

443
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Uh. if you want a taste
of the good stuff.

444
00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
there's a bottle of scotch
in this bottom cabinet there.

445
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000
You can help yourself.

446
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Hey. how much money
you make. man?

447
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
It's a... It's a living.

448
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000
So. if I... Say. I get you.
like. some good information.

449
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000
Somethin' nobody else knows.

450
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Is there some kind
of bonus or somethin'?

451
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
Well. I'm counting on it. Bill.

452
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
But. to answer your question.
you scratch my back.

453
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
Make yourself at home.

454
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000
Did he say
when this meeting's

455
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000
No. just that Hampton wants
to unify the Black gangs.

456
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
You know. he'd probably help us
write the darn thing

457
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000
for a couple more bucks.

458
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
What fun would that be?

459
00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000
I'm pretty sure it's actually
just "dig." not "dig in."

460
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
What the fuck do you know?

461
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000
I know
I've definitely heard 'em

462
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000
-Oh. really?
-Yeah.

463
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000
Use it in a sentence.

464
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000
Oh. Okay.

465
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
These Crowns.
well. they ain't nothin'...

466
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000
but a bunch of jive sissies.

467
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000
Deputy Chairman Fred Hampton
of the Illinois

468
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Fred Hampton.

469
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
the great orator
of the West Side!

470
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000
Your name's been ringing out.
blood.

471
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
It's your world. Brother Steel.

472
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
Hmm.

473
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000
So. what can I do for you?

474
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Well. I wanna know
what we can do for each other.

475
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
Y'all was doin' some great work

476
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
mobilizing young brothers
on the South Side.

477
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
and we a part of
a national organization

478
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
dedicated to the liberation
for oppressed people

479
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Whee!

480
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000
This nigga got some
million-dollar words. don't he?

481
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000
They wasn't lyin'.

482
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000
It's not just talk. brother.

483
00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000
Our breakfast program feeds
over 3.000 kids a week.

484
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Motherfucker. the Crowns feed
more babies than General Mills.

485
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Now. who you think employs
all their mommies and daddies?

486
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000
Well. right on. brother.
right on.

487
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000
But question is.
can you do even more?

488
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000
Hmm?

489
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000
There's over 5.000 Crowns
in Chicago.

490
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
Between your manpower
and the Panther's

491
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
we can heal this whole city.

492
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
And if we take care of Chicago.

493
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000
shit.

494
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Come on. man.

495
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000
You mind
if I read you something.

496
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000
Somebody dumped a whole bunch
of these pamphlets

497
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000
on our front yard
the other day.

498
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
and I just thought
they might be

499
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000
-Do you mind if I...
-Go ahead.

500
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000
"Word on the street

501
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
is that the Crowns
got more rats

502
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
Where you think
they get all their money from?

503
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000
The pigs run
their whole operation.

504
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Well. lemme tell you what.
chump.

505
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000
When you lie with pigs.
you don't just get flies.

506
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000
you get Panthers.

507
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000
itching

508
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000
to blow your big. Uncle Tom.
watermelon-head off.

509
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000
Because what's a rat
to a big. black jungle cat?"

510
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Get your ass out here!

511
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000
Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out of here!

512
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000
"When the Panthers are done
with the Crowns..."

513
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
-Shit.

514
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
"...they won't have
a watermelon-head

515
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Dig in?"

516
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000
"Dig in?"

517
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000
That you? This your work?

518
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
-Brother. come on...
- Dick Tracy!

519
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
I see you traded in
your badge for...

520
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Nigga. you know
not to speak outta turn.

521
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000
It's that motherfucker

522
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000
-that stole Ant's car.
- Shut up!

523
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000
Apologize.

524
00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Sorry.
- Speak up.

525
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000
Sorry!

526
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000
If that was us murder mouthin'.
where our guns at. huh?

527
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000
We came to y'all headquarters
unarmed.

528
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
So. who do you think
wrote it. then?

529
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000
The pigs. who else?

530
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
The pigs don't write. blood.

531
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
The Feds do.

532
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000
They pulled the same shit
on Martin and Malcolm.

533
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000
Mm-hmm.

534
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000
And what happened to them?

535
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
Same shit that's gonna happen
to all of us.

536
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000
At least they died
for the people.

537
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000
We should be so lucky.

538
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
You gonna need this.

539
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000
Tread lightly. blood.

540
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000
Hey. Chairman. Chairman.
Let me take that

541
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Maybe the Disciples
will be more receptive.

542
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
You can bet the Disciples
got one of them

543
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
The pigs got ahead of us.

544
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
Ah. So. what.
you ridin' with me?

545
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
You got your piece on you.
comrade?

546
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
Yeah. it's in the glove box.

547
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
Why? What's up?

548
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
Come on. Judy.
You know what...

549
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
What was all that shit
about a badge?

550
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
Badge?

551
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000
Man. what the fuck is your...
Ow!

552
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000
All right. all right.
all right!

553
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000
Calm down! Calm the fuck down!

554
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000
Can I talk to her?
Can I talk to her?

555
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
All right.

556
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.000
Y'all ain't gonna believe me.
all right?

557
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
I used to pretend I was a Fed
back when I used

558
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Shh.
-When I used to boost cars.

559
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000
What kinda fucking sense
does that make?

560
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
A pig boosting cars.

561
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000
Now. what I would do
is I would pretend.

562
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000
And then I say
your car is reported stolen.

563
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000
And then I'd hop in it.
and I'd just ride. Just go.

564
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
Before anybody
knew the difference.

565
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.000
I was in the wind.
dig what I'm sayin'?

566
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000
You would be surprised
what they believe.

567
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
You put on one of them coats
and the Humphrey Bogart hat...

568
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000
You steal this car?

569
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000
Yeah. no. Yeah. from a pimp.

570
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000
And a pimp believed
you were a Fed?

571
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000
Okay. so. I...

572
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000
What kinda amateur-hour macks
you be knowin' out here. man?

573
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000
I hot-wired this shit.
all right?

574
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000
All right?

575
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000
-Do it again.
-What?

576
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
You say
you hot-wired this shit.

577
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000
-so do it again.
-

578
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Okay. look. look. uh...

579
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000
I ain't got no goddamn tools
on me right now

580
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000
Comrade. reach in my boot.

581
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000
Oh. come on now. y'all.

582
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
All right.
give me the motherfucker. man.

583
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000
Shit.

584
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
All right. give me a second.
Give me a second.

585
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Shit.

586
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000
Come on. come on.
come on...

587
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Come on. baby.

588
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
Are you happy?

589
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000
How did you get keys
to a hot car?

590
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000
Now. you think in your mind.
I'm gonna pick up a stone fox

591
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000
in this bad motherfucker
right here.

592
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000
and start it up with a goddamn
screwdriver in the ignition?

593
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000
I had my boy replace the lock.
motherfucker. Come on. man.

594
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000
God dawg. man.

595
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
Can you get
that motherfucker off me now?

596
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000
Wild Bill.

597
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000
They don't attack me

598
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000
They attack me
'cause I'm Black.

599
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000
They attacked all of us
for the same reason.

600
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000
All of us catch hell
from the same enemy.

601
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000
-We're all in the same bag...
- In the same bag.

602
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000
-...in the same boat.
-In the same boat.

603
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000
We suffer
political oppression...

604
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000
We suffer
political oppression.

605
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000
-...economic exploitation...
-Economic exploitation.

606
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000
-...and social degradation.
-And social degradation.

607
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000
All of 'em from the same enemy.

608
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000
All of 'em from the same enemy.

609
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000
-The government has failed us.
-  The government has failed us.

610
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.000
-You can't deny that.
-You can't deny that.

611
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Any time you're living
in the 20th century. 1964.

612
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000
and you walking around here
singing "We Shall Overcome."

613
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
-the government has failed you.
-The government has failed you.

614
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000
Keep going.

615
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000
Mm-mm.

616
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000
Well. do you know his speech
The Black Revolution?

617
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000
"Sometimes.
when a person's house

618
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000
...and the person to whom
the house belongs to

619
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000
...if someone comes in
yelling 'fire.'

620
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000
instead of the person
to whom the house belongs to

621
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
...they make the mistake
of charging the one

622
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000
with having set the fire.

623
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
-I hope that--"
-"I hope that

624
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000
this little conversation
tonight about

625
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000
won't cause many of you

626
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000
-to accuse us
of igniting it..."

627
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000
"...when you find it
at your doorstep."

628
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
Well. you gotta do the voice.

629
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000
"When you find it
at your doorstep."

630
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Mm-hmm.

631
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000
I listen to him every morning.

632
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000
I feel like he never lets folks
put words in his mouth.

633
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000
and no matter what.
he doesn't get flustered

634
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000
I'd like to be like that
someday.

635
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.000
Right on.

636
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.000
Right on.

637
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000
Anyway. I didn't mean
to interrupt.

638
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000
You want some coffee?

639
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.000
Sure.

640
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.000
How you take it?

641
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000
Black. and sweet.

642
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000
What?

643
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000
I did not expect you to be shy.

644
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Oh. I'm not shy.

645
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000
Okay.

646
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
We ain't talkin' about
some hippies playing bongos

647
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000
These the same motherfuckers
hit Dr. King with a brick.

648
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000
I don't know how I feel
about goin' up in there

649
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.000
Right on.

650
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Best you stay behind. then.

651
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000
Displace maybe two.
three times as many of us.

652
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000
Well. they might think
it's easy to throw out

653
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000
but they better
fuckin' burn it!

654
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000
Whoo.

655
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000
You're Fred Hampton.

656
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000
You must be the Preacherman.

657
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000
Well. I'm a fan
of y'all's paper.

658
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Funnies. especially.

659
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000
That flag is some

660
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.000
Comrade.

661
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000
Take it easy. comrade.

662
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000
It's just up there to remind us
of our Southern heritage.

663
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000
When I look at that.
I don't see no flag hanging.

664
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000
I see my uncle
hanging from a tree.

665
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000
And a bunch of white devils
like y'all

666
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Who the fuck
you think you're talkin' to?

667
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.000
Hey. cool it. cool it!

668
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000
-You're in our house.
-Hey. cool it!

669
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000
Look. we oppressed your people
for a long time...

670
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000
I didn't oppress shit.
And my folks grew up poor.

671
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000
They were sharecroppers.

672
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000
AKA the overseer.

673
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000
What if the overseer
had banded with the slaves

674
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000
and cut the master's throat?

675
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000
What then. comrade?

676
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000
We might not be
in this funky-ass ghetto

677
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000
I'm not talking about
the West Side

678
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000
I'm talkin'
this filthy-ass motherfucker

679
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000
Shit.

680
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000
We almost got into it
with a rat

681
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000
I bet y'all babies
gettin' the same

682
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000
Y'all payin' the same taxes

683
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.000
to get your heads whooped in
by the same motherfuckin' pigs.

684
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.000
Ain't that a trip?

685
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000
We pay them. huh?

686
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000
We pay the pigs
to run us off of our corners.

687
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000
Let me ask y'all somethin'.

688
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000
If this building caught fire
right now.

689
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000
Water and escape.

690
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.000
If somebody were to ask you.

691
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.000
"What's your culture
during this fire. brother?"

692
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000
"Water. that's my culture."

693
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000
"Well. how about
your politics?"

694
00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:00.000
Well. guess what.
America is on fire right now.

695
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000
and until that fire
is extinguished.

696
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000
don't nothin' else
mean a goddamn thing.

697
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.000
So. rednecks
and Puerto Ricans.

698
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000
In Chicago.

699
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000
That motherfucker Fred.
he could sell salt to a slug.

700
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Nice work. Bill.
-

701
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Chicago's
the most segregated city

702
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000
Not Shreveport!

703
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000
Not Birmingham!

704
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000
But we here to change that.

705
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000
The Black Panthers.
the Young Lords.

706
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000
are forming a Rainbow Coalition

707
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000
of oppressed
brothers and sisters

708
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000
Cha Cha. tell 'em
why we gathered here today.

709
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000
Last week.

710
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000
our brother. Manuel Ramos.

711
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000
was shot in the head
and killed by an off-duty pig.

712
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.000
So. we caught the pig
and turned him over

713
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000
And for some reason.

714
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000
we expected justice.

715
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000
Well. let's see what they do.
now that we're in front

716
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000
and we demand
an independent investigation!

717
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000
No more pigs
in our community!

718
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000
Off the pigs!

719
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000
No more pigs
in our community!

720
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.000
Off the pigs!

721
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.000
No more pigs in our community!

722
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000
Off the pigs!

723
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.000
No more pigs
in our community!

724
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.000
Off the pigs!

725
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000
No more pigs
in our community!

726
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Uh. your feet cold.

727
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Why your feet so cold?

728
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000
No!
Get 'em off of me!

729
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000
My feet cold. your feet cold.

730
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000
No. unless you...
They're like...

731
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
-But that's socialism. man.

732
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000
Well. you gotta warm 'em up.
though.

733
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000
Well. how you think
Mao did the Long March. huh?

734
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.000
The Chinese would warm
these feet left and right.

735
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000
You saying
I'm a foot capitalist?

736
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000
You really gonna call me
a foot capitalist. Chairman?

737
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000
So. summer of '69.

738
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000
the Rainbow Coalition
is in full swing.

739
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000
Fred's influence is growing.
What happens next?

740
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000
I want him off the street.

741
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.000
Charge him with something.
Anything.

742
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000
But get his Black ass
off the street.

743
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000
Y'all don't see there's
kids in here? Huh?

744
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000
Of course. you're gonna wait
till you get to

745
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.000
to pull somethin' like this!

746
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000
-Bunch of cowards!
-Deborah...

747
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.000
-Tighten up.
-You disgust--

748
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
-Come on. now.
-You disgust me!

749
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.000
Show some discipline.
Tell Rush to get me a lawyer.

750
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.000
What was he arrested for?

751
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000
Don't worry. y'all.
I'll be right back.

752
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.000
Ice cream.

753
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000
Yeah. he was accused of taking

754
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000
70-something dollars' worth
of ice cream.

755
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000
And I think he got
two to five for that.

756
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000
And how did
Fred going to prison

757
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000
How didn't it? You know.
membership decreased.

758
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Donations started dwindling.

759
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000
Because I was so good
at installing alarms.

760
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000
you know. buzzers
and things like that.

761
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000
Rush decided to promote me
to security captain.

762
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000
Whoa!

763
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000
Damn it. man!
What the fuck are you doin'?

764
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.000
We got a visitor.

765
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Brother on the run
from the pigs.

766
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.000
Can't be too careful.

767
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000
All right. all right.
God damn it.

768
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.000
Put that shit down.

769
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000
Shit. man.

770
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000
Got to watch that shit. man.

771
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.000
Who's that?

772
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000
Security Captain Bill O'Neal.
motherfucker. Who are you?

773
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.000
I'm George Sams.

774
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.000
Security captain
for the New Haven chapter.

775
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000
Pardon the paranoia.

776
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000
Hey. we got a rat. man.

777
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.000
What?

778
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.000
They smoked one out.

779
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000
-In New Haven.
-How? How?

780
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000
They put a squeeze
on that motherfucker.

781
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.000
Now. I didn't say that.

782
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000
I said the brother
got some discipline

783
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000
in the area of the nose
and the mouth.

784
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000
And then.
the brother started to show

785
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.000
boiled some water. gave him
a little more discipline.

786
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000
We held a trial first.

787
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.000
Well. shit. where he at now?

788
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.000
He's at
the bottom of the river

789
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:44.000
Shit. nigga.
what you think he did?

790
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000
Shit. I would have killed
that motherfucker. too.

791
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000
Killed him dead.
I'd have beat the shit

792
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000
I would have shot that nigga.
stabbed his ass. or...

793
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000
Man. y'all lucky
I wasn't there.

794
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000
Boy...

795
00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000
Motherfucker. please.

796
00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.000
All right. player.
all right. all right.

797
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.000
Bitch motherfucker.

798
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000
-Does anybody else
know about me?

799
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.000
-Huh?
-No.

800
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.000
From the Bureau?

801
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000
No. No. my superiors know

802
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000
-I have a man
on the inside. but...

803
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000
My superiors know I have a man
on the inside. but that's it.

804
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000
No one knows your identity.

805
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000
Are you sure?

806
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.000
I swear on my kids. okay?

807
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000
What has got you all spooked?

808
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000
Oh. man. it...

809
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.000
Okay. this Panther
from New Haven

810
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000
And he talkin'
about they caught an informant.

811
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.000
and they tortured him.
and they killed him. Roy.

812
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000
Who did?

813
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000
His name is George Sams.

814
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000
George Sams.

815
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.000
And who's the fella
they killed. this informant?

816
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.000
His name is Alex Rackley.

817
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000
It's a guy outta New York.
I don't know.

818
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000
But. shit. Roy...

819
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.000
Where is Sams hiding now?

820
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000
He's hidin' at the office

821
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.000
He say he's gonna skip town
and. you know. get outta here.

822
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000
Okay. I need you to draw up
a floor plan of the office.

823
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.000
With this intel.
I can get authorization

824
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.000
What?

825
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.000
-Don't worry. Bill.
-What the fuck

826
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.000
I will give you a heads-up.
so you can

827
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000
Roy. are you fuckin'
listenin' to me right now?

828
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.000
They poured boiling water
all over this motherfucker.

829
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000
Yes. I understand.
I'm not surprised.

830
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000
What did I tell you?
No different from the Klan.

831
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.000
Now you see.

832
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:49.000
Look. now.
y'all gonna have to come up

833
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.000
for this. all right?

834
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:57.000
I will make sure
you're properly compensated.

835
00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000
Discipline in the area

836
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.000
-Yeah?

837
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.000
Sir.

838
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.000
A Panther on the run
from Connecticut

839
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:11.000
Says he was part of a group
that killed another Panther.

840
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000
An informant.

841
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000
George Sams.

842
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000
Warrant's being written up
as we speak.

843
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000
We're going in on Wednesday.

844
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:20.000
How'd you know?

845
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:24.000
Sams is one of our guys.
Warrant's just a pretense.

846
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000
So. Sams is the informant?

847
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.000
Mm-hmm.

848
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.000
So. he didn't really kill.
uh...

849
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.000
Alex Rackley?

850
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.000
No. he did.

851
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000
Well. he claims two other guys
were the triggermen.

852
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000
but what's he gonna say?

853
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000
Forgive me. I'm confused.

854
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:56.000
So. this kid. Alex Rackley.

855
00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000
was labelled an informant
and then killed...

856
00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.000
Mm-hmm.

857
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.000
...by an actual FBI informant.

858
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.000
And we're just letting him
walk for murder?

859
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.000
It's beautiful.

860
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.000
He's on the lam. right?

861
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.000
So. any time he goes
into a Panther office.

862
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.000
we get a warrant
for harboring a fugitive.

863
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.000
He's in the interview room
right now

864
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.000
planning the next stop
on his little tour.

865
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.000
Wow. That's. uh...

866
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.000
Takes a thief
to catch a thief. Roy.

867
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:36.000
We got a snitch.

868
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000
What the fuck
is you talkin' about?

869
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000
How the fuck
did the pigs know

870
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000
Y'all ever think about that?
Huh?

871
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.000
That motherfucker
run his mouth so much.

872
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000
he probably outed
his damn self.

873
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000
No. nigga. Because they took
the donor rolls.

874
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000
and they left
all these goddamn binders here.

875
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.000
You understand
what I'm saying?

876
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000
They went straight
for the safe.

877
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.000
Then. they went straight
into the weapons cabinet.

878
00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000
which is right
in the fuckin' slop closet.

879
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.000
It's like they knew
where everything was.

880
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000
-Hey. smarten up. brother.
- What?

881
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000
You're fallin'
right into the pigs' trap.

882
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000
What the fuck
are you talkin' about. man?

883
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000
You know. Jimmy.
maybe you a goddamn pig.

884
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.000
-You ever think about that?
-What? Man. fuck you. nigga!

885
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000
Hey! Hey! Hey! Cool it!

886
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.000
You ever do that shit again.

887
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:17.000
Both of y'all.
show some discipline!

888
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000
-Are you okay?
-There's a goddamn rat

889
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000
And when I find him.
I'm gonna smoke him out.

890
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000
You motherfuckers hear me?
I'm gonna smoke him out.

891
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000
You thought New Haven was bad?

892
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.000
You keep fuckin' with me!

893
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.000
-You keep fuckin' with me!
- Cool it!

894
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.000
Cool it. O'Neal!

895
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.000
God damn it!

896
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000
Dear Comrade Deborah.

897
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:02.000
I dreamt of you
the other night.

898
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:06.000
and for a second.
I thought I was home.

899
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000
Pardon the delay
in writing you. I am...

900
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.000
CO!

901
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.000
-It was not by choice.
-  CO!

902
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.000
The pigs do everything
in their power

903
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000
Because they know.
the day we get organized.

904
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:24.000
it's over for their asses.

905
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:30.000
Not having books. I find myself
playing old speeches

906
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.000
and I keep comin' back
to this line from Dr. King...

907
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.000
"Let us not wallow
in the valley of despair."

908
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000
because make no mistake.
comrade.

909
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000
this is the fuckin' valley.

910
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000
But where some see despair.

911
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:49.000
I see ground zero
for the revolution.

912
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:52.000
Two thousand brothers
who know who the enemy is.

913
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.000
Who don't need
the contradiction

914
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000
Because in Menard.

915
00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.000
the contradictions don't get
more black and white.

916
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:05.000
I mean. a lot of these brothers
came here politicized. too.

917
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000
They just need organizing.

918
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000
By the time I'm through.

919
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000
I might fuck around
and have the pigs

920
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000
I have so many questions
about how you doing.

921
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000
about how the party's doing.

922
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:26.000
But ain't no way you're gettin'
a kite to me in this hellhole.

923
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.000
God forbid.
one of the party members

924
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:32.000
they could let me know
how y'all are farin'.

925
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.000
But I'd rather be
left in the dark.

926
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000
The last thing I want
is y'all up in here with me.

927
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.000
or worse.

928
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:44.000
Tell the comrades
to be careful.

929
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:48.000
Especially when they out
patrollin' the pigs.

930
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.000
A brother who just got in here
told me they been

931
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000
since the summer started.

932
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000
Y'all stay safe.

933
00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:03.000
In revolutionary love.
Chairman Fred.

934
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.000
Officers!
Now. what crime have

935
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000
Get the fuck outta here.

936
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000
No. see. I live here.

937
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000
Now. y'all get the fuck
up outta here.

938
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000
Shit.

939
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:33.000
-

940
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000
-Jake.
-Hey. Reg.

941
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000
The fuck you doin' up in here?

942
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.000
I sure as shit know
a squirrel like you

943
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:44.000
Nah. man. My comrade. Palmer.
got shot by the pigs.

944
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.000
I'm lookin' in on him.

945
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:48.000
All right. brother. Be careful.

946
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000
No visitors allowed.

947
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.000
Yeah. but the nurse told me
visiting hours

948
00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000
Not for your pal here.

949
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Can I at least
leave him the books?

950
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.000
You may not.

951
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.000
"If we must die.
let us not be like hogs."

952
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000
Come on.

953
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.000
"Hunted and penned
in an inglorious spot."

954
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000
Do us both a favor
and get lost.

955
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000
"While around us
bark the mad and hungry dogs.

956
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000
-making their mock at..."
-Winters?

957
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.000
Jimmy! Hey.
how you holdin' up. man?

958
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000
You got five seconds
to fuck off.

959
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:33.000
-One. Two. Three.
- Shit.

960
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.000
All right. that's it.

961
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.000
All right.

962
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.000
Hey. I'mma get with you. Jimmy.

963
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000
Hey. Williams.
is that Harriet Tubman?

964
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.000
You made it out. You're good.

965
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.000
Oh. I'm sorry.
It's Aunt Jemima.

966
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.000
I love the pancakes. miss.

967
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.000
What's up. guys?

968
00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000
I just want
you all to know

969
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000
you can thank
the Black Panther Party

970
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:06.000
for the increased
police presence

971
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.000
A glorious group
of cop-killers.

972
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.000
I'm about to fuckin' move
in over here.

973
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:15.000
I'm about to get
my fuckin' couch.

974
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000
-Is the back clear?
-Clear.

975
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.000
-You got a whistle?
-Fuck it. bring the kids.

976
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.000
Escort Comrade Deborah
out the back to the safe house.

977
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.000
What? Why?

978
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:23.000
I'll take Deborah.
Come on. babe.

979
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:24.000
You don't even know
where it is.

980
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000
I ain't goin' nowhere.

981
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.000
I don't know about you.
but I believe they wake up

982
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000
I can protect myself.

983
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000
I know you can.

984
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:39.000
But you don't got just yourself
to think about anymore.

985
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:44.000
I didn't wanna have to say it
like this. but I...

986
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.000
I recognize
what you're going through.

987
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.000
with the chairman
being locked up and everything.

988
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000
Does he know?

989
00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000
-Deb. I...
-

990
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000
Now. Judy.
you know this ain't nothin'

991
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.000
but a couple of drunk-ass pigs.

992
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:16.000
They probably gonna leave here.
go get some donuts

993
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.000
Maybe.

994
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000
I'll tell you
what they definitely

995
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.000
and that's come up in here.

996
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.000
Not again.
White. you guard the rear.

997
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000
Hey. Panthers!

998
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000
If you really give a fuck
about these people out here.

999
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000
you'll come down.

1000
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.000
You little motherfuckers think
it's cool to shoot a cop?

1001
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.000
Make sure she gets home safe.

1002
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.000
Today's the day.

1003
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:36.000
Today's the fuckin' day!

1004
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:39.000
Either you fucks come down
or we're comin' up!

1005
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.000
-Gun!
-

1006
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.000
10-1. we need backup.
Black Panther headquarters.

1007
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.000
Hey. kid.
clear the fuckin' sidewalks!

1008
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.000
Move! Kid! Kid!

1009
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.000
Who's got the room?

1010
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:55.000
Get off the fuckin' sidewalk!

1011
00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.000
I got the shooter!

1012
00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.000
-What the fuck you doin'?
- I'mma cover you

1013
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
-O'Neal. where are you going?
-Trust me.

1014
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
it'll make better sense
when they call for backup.

1015
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
and they're goin'
to call for backup.

1016
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
-Hey.
- What's up?

1017
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000
I'mma go secure the roof.
all right?

1018
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Right on.
-All right.

1019
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Fuck.

1020
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Fuck.

1021
01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Watch your backs!

1022
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Look at that window!

1023
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Hold your positions!

1024
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Do you guys see
any other weapons

1025
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Is there any visuals?

1026
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Sniper!

1027
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000
-God...
-

1028
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
-

1029
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
I hate you! You swine!

1030
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Keep 'em back!

1031
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
White! You okay?

1032
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Fuck. I'm out!

1033
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Stop shootin'!
We comin' out!

1034
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Comin' out!

1035
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
We're comin' out!
We're comin' out!

1036
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Cease fire! Cease fire!

1037
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000
God damn it!
God damn it. cease fire!

1038
01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Come out with your hands up!

1039
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Comin' out!
We're comin' out!

1040
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Cease fire!
Cease fire!

1041
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Drop your weapon!

1042
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Move in! Move in!
- Motherfucker!

1043
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000
-No!
- Let her go!

1044
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
That's a woman. man!

1045
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000
What the fuck happened?

1046
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
What you doing?

1047
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Get 'em in the fuckin' wagon!

1048
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Get in the building.
I need to blow the building!

1049
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
I need explosives
inside the building!

1050
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Keep 'em back! Keep 'em back!

1051
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Let 'em go! Let 'em go!

1052
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
They're gonna burn it down.
They're gonna burn it down!

1053
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000
No! Get off of me! No!

1054
01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Get off of me!
Get off of me!

1055
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
It's over.

1056
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Mitchell.

1057
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Hey. listen.
I'm out. Roy. I'm out!

1058
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Calm down. Calm down. Bill.

1059
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Don't you tell me
to fuckin' calm down.

1060
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
I was almost killed. man!

1061
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Now. Fred's in jail.
I did the damn job.

1062
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
No. that's not how it works.

1063
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
What the fuck do you mean.
"That's not how it works"?

1064
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Why don't you give me
one good reason

1065
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
why I don't just book it
outta here right now?

1066
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Because. as I've mentioned.

1067
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
it's a year and a half
for the stolen car.

1068
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
and five years
for impersonating

1069
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000
And if you run.
I will hunt you down.

1070
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Man. shut the fuck up!

1071
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Fuck!

1072
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
What do we need?
-  What do you mean?

1073
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
You the handyman.
Oakland says

1074
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
What do we need?

1075
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
We need
a goddamn white flag. Bobby!

1076
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.000
-Don't you understand
this shit is...

1077
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
They burnt the shit
out this motherfucker.

1078
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000
You're goddamn right.
they did.

1079
01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Watch your mouth. man!

1080
01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Y'all need help?

1081
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Yeah. little brother.

1082
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Um. go on down to the store
and get us

1083
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000
That's how you rebuild.
comrade.

1084
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Hey! Hey! Can I help y'all?

1085
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
We came to ask y'all that.

1086
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Got some bodies
if you need 'em.

1087
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Look. I know y'all got an army
and all that.

1088
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
but figured y'all could use
some reserves.

1089
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Oh. right on.

1090
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Y'all know how to use
a tape measure?

1091
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
'Cause this needs measurin'
right here. all right?

1092
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
And then that drywall
right there

1093
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
needs to be measured out
and flushed.

1094
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
you know. how I got it here.

1095
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
And the rest of y'all can grab
some of these paint rollers.

1096
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
and help 'em with that wall.

1097
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Yeah. right there is good.

1098
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Los Angeles leaders
Bunchy Carter and John Huggins.

1099
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Well. former leaders.

1100
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Chalk marks. all that's left.

1101
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Our friend. Mr. Cleaver...

1102
01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000
On the lam in Algeria.

1103
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
A gift from our friends
at Langley.

1104
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Hmm.
- Oh.

1105
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Our old friend. Bobby Seale.

1106
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000
You recognize this
from the evening news.

1107
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000
It must be very cold
in that Chicago courtroom.

1108
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Speaking of Seale.

1109
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000
if the Seale verdict
does not fall our way.

1110
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.000
we have a witness
who'll testify he ordered

1111
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.000
I believe you're familiar
with George Sams.

1112
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Yes. sir.

1113
01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Very well.
Have a seat. gentlemen.

1114
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000
How are the boys.
Jack and Tyler?

1115
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Good. sir.

1116
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Thank you. Uh...

1117
01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Tyler just started
Little League.

1118
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Kid's got quite an arm on him.

1119
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000
And your daughter. Samantha.

1120
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000
she must be. what.
eight months now. is it?

1121
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
That's right.

1122
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:42.000
She's growing fast every day.

1123
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
They always do. don't they?

1124
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Tell me...

1125
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.000
What will you do
when she brings home a Negro?

1126
01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
When she brings home a Negro?

1127
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Your daughter. Samantha.

1128
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:06.000
What will you do the day
she brings home

1129
01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
She's an infant. sir.

1130
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
I'm well aware.

1131
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
And that's not an answer
to my question.

1132
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
She won't.

1133
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Why not?

1134
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Because...

1135
01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Respectfully. Director.
why are we talking about

1136
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
You killed in Korea.

1137
01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Yes.

1138
01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Not for country.

1139
01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Maybe that's why you enlisted.
But you killed for survival.

1140
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
You would have done anything

1141
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000
to get back home safe
to your family. wouldn't you?

1142
01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Of course.

1143
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Think of your family now.
Agent Mitchell.

1144
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000
When you look at Hampton.
think of Samantha.

1145
01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.000
because that's what's at stake
if we lose this war.

1146
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Our entire way of life.

1147
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Rape. pillage. conquer.

1148
01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
You follow me?

1149
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
I do. sir.

1150
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Hampton's in Menard
doing two to five.

1151
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Hampton is getting out.

1152
01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.000
while the State Supreme Court
considers his appeal.

1153
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000
In the interim.

1154
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
your CI is our best chance

1155
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000
at neutralizing him.
Agent Mitchell.

1156
01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Maybe it's time to use O'Neal
more creatively.

1157
01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000
You look beautiful.
you know that?

1158
01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
-You know that?
-Mm-hmm.

1159
01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Whoo!

1160
01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Now. y'all save that shit

1161
01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000
for when you get back
to the house. all right?

1162
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
-Careful. now.
-

1163
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Whew!

1164
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
You look good. Chairman!

1165
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000
How ya feelin'?

1166
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000
I miss y'all motherfuckers.
man!

1167
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000
-Come on. man!

1168
01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Yeah. so where you wanna go?
You hungry? What?

1169
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Headquarters.

1170
01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Mm-hmm.

1171
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Shit. headquarters it is. boy.

1172
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
How'd y'all...

1173
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000
But it was burned down.
I saw...

1174
01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Then the whole
neighborhood came out.

1175
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000
The pushers. the grannies.
the Crowns. Everybody.

1176
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.000
'Specially this one right here.

1177
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
-He practically led the charge.
-Come on. now. man.

1178
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Don't be modest. brother.

1179
01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Power.

1180
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Anywhere there's people.

1181
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000
there's power.

1182
01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Right on.

1183
01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Thank you. brother.

1184
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Chairman!

1185
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
-Oh!
-

1186
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
I was wondering
why it was so quiet. man.

1187
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
-I was like.

1188
01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000
"These motherfuckers
better be out here

1189
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
feedin' these babies overtime

1190
01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000
if they're not gonna welcome
a brother home. God damn it!"

1191
01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Come on. man!

1192
01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000
You made it.

1193
01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Oh. man. I missed
y'all motherfuckers. man.

1194
01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
We missed you. too. man!

1195
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
You know
I missed you. too. man!

1196
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Yeah. brother.
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

1197
01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
All right.
let me outta here!

1198
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Let me outta here!
Let me outta here!

1199
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
You the man.
You stay in here and man up!

1200
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Black Panther Party

1201
01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000
All that complainin'...

1202
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Right on.
how's it going. brother?

1203
01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Rush?

1204
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.000
I feel your pain. sister.

1205
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
But we at war. you know?

1206
01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000
He's gone.

1207
01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Excuse me. sister.
- All right.

1208
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
What's up?

1209
01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Jimmy Palmer died.

1210
01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
What? How?

1211
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Can we talk about this outside.

1212
01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
He was shot
while you were gone.

1213
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Comrade. why is this the first
I'm hearin' about this. man?

1214
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Who was shot?

1215
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Jimmy Palmer.

1216
01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Yeah. he's fine.
Y'all know that.

1217
01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000
He died. Jake.

1218
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Last night.

1219
01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Nah. that's impossible.

1220
01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
I just talked to him
the other day.

1221
01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Anybody got the number
for Loretto...

1222
01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.000
He was moved
to the county hospital.

1223
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Get this fuckin'...

1224
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Get this shit off of me.
Hey. motherfuck...

1225
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
They killed him.

1226
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
They fuckin' killed him.

1227
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Jake.

1228
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Jake.

1229
01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Jake!

1230
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Chairman Fred! Chairman Fred!

1231
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Chairman Fred! Chairman Fred!
Chairman Fred!

1232
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.000
I'm free.

1233
01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000
-

1234
01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.000
I'm free. y'all!

1235
01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.000
I need everybody
to repeat after me! I am...

1236
01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000
I am...

1237
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
-...a revolutionary!
- ...a revolutionary!

1238
01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.000
-I am...
- I am...

1239
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.000
-...a revolutionary!
- ...a revolutionary!

1240
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
-I am...
-I am...

1241
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000
-...a revolutionary!
-...a revolutionary!

1242
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000
-I am...
-I am...

1243
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
-...a revolutionary!
-...a revolutionary!

1244
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000
-I am...
-I am...

1245
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
-...a revolutionary!
-...a revolutionary!

1246
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.000
-I am...
-I am...

1247
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
-...a revolutionary!
-...a revolutionary!

1248
01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Drummer.
lemme hear the people beat!

1249
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
This is what we call
the people beat.

1250
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Started in 1966 by Huey Newton
and Bobby Seale.

1251
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000
It's the beat that manifests
in you. the people.

1252
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
They can't never stop the party

1253
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
-unless they stop the people!
-

1254
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000
-Well. ain't you high?
Ain't you high?

1255
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000
-I'm high off the people!
-

1256
01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
-I'm high!
-I'm high!

1257
01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
I'm high!
-I'm high!

1258
01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000
High. high. high...
- High. high. high...

1259
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.000
-...off the people!
- ...off the people!

1260
01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
So. if you were asked
to make a commitment at age 20.

1261
01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000
and you said.
"I'm too young to die."

1262
01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
If you dare to struggle.
you dare to win!

1263
01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.000
If you dare not struggle.
then. God damn it.

1264
01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Right. Right.

1265
01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Put a fist in the air
for Comrade Jimmy Palmer.

1266
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Jimmy Palmer died
a revolutionary death.

1267
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:47.000
He stood face-to-face
and toe-to-toe

1268
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.000
and made the greatest sacrifice
one could ever make.

1269
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.000
-Right on!

1270
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000
I don't believe I'm gonna die
in no car wreck!

1271
01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000
I don't believe I'm gonna die
slippin' on no ice!

1272
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.000
I don't believe I'm gonna die
'cause I got a bad heart!

1273
01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.000
I believe I'm gonna die
doin' what I was born for!

1274
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000
I believe I'm gonna die
high off the people!

1275
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
I'm gonna die for the people.
'cause I live for the people!

1276
01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.000
I live for the people.
'cause I love the people!

1277
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
-

1278
01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.000
And as for them bloodthirsty.
murderous pigs...

1279
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Well. some of you might be
in the audience right now. huh?

1280
01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Sittin' on a tape recorder.
gun in your hand!

1281
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Well. lemme make it plain.

1282
01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Kill a few pigs.
get a little satisfaction.

1283
01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Right on. Right on.

1284
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Kill some more pigs.
get some more satisfaction.

1285
01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Kill 'em all
and get complete satisfaction!

1286
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000
-

1287
01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Chairman Fred! Chairman Fred!

1288
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Chairman Fred! Chairman Fred!

1289
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.000
It's not a question of violence
or non-violence.

1290
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
It's a question of
resistance to fascism

1291
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.000
or non-existence
within fascism!

1292
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
You can murder a liberator.
but you can't murder

1293
01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000
You can murder a revolutionary.
but you can't murder

1294
01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.000
And you can murder
a freedom fighter.

1295
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
-

1296
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
-I said I am...
- I am...

1297
01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
...a revolutionary!
-...a revolutionary!

1298
01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.000
I am...
-I am...

1299
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
-...a revolutionary!
-...a revolutionary!

1300
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.000
-I am...
-I am...

1301
01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
-...a revolutionary!
-...a revolutionary!

1302
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
-I am...
-I am...

1303
01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.000
-...a revolutionary!
-...a revolutionary!

1304
01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Drummer.
lemme hear the people beat!

1305
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000
-Lemme hear the people beat!
-

1306
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Chairman Fred! Chairman Fred!

1307
01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Chairman Fred! Chairman Fred!

1308
01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Right! Right!

1309
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Put your fists in the air!

1310
01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
-Right!

1311
01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:18.000
-Winters. fuck you doin' here?
-

1312
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Lookin' for some answers.

1313
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Answers to what?

1314
01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Remember I saw you
not too long ago

1315
01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Yeah.

1316
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000
The pigs took my man
outta there.

1317
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
I don't know nothin'
about that.

1318
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.000
No. look. I was thinking
maybe you could ask

1319
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
And fuck my money up?

1320
01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Nigga. do you have any idea

1321
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
how treacherous
them crackers is

1322
01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
-I don't want no parts of that.
-Reg. please. Please. man.

1323
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Look. man.
I'm cold and I'm hungry.

1324
01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Come on. brother!

1325
01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.000
I ain't your brother!

1326
01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Now. get the fuck off my porch
before you end up

1327
01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Man. fuck...

1328
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:05.000
No. I just wanted to know
what happened.

1329
01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.000
I just wanted to know
what happened to my friend!

1330
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Reg!

1331
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Yeah.

1332
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Reg!

1333
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Across the street
from the oil refinery.

1334
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Uh. Lawn... Lawndale and 45th.

1335
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.000
He... He's got a gun.
A big one.

1336
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:06.000
What are you doin'?
That's private! It's private...

1337
01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
You think you gonna be
a bad mother?

1338
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000
It was a question.

1339
01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Why you gotta
ask yourself that?

1340
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
I don't... I don't know.

1341
01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Maybe the fact
that I'm bringin' a child

1342
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:25.000
These aren't considerations
you have to make.

1343
01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000
You get to go out there.

1344
01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
talk about dyin'
a revolutionary death

1345
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000
and how your body belong
to the revolution.

1346
01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:35.000
because you don't have
another person

1347
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
So. you regret it?

1348
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
-What?
-Havin' my baby.

1349
01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Do you?

1350
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:55.000
When I dedicated
my life to the people.

1351
01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
You dig?

1352
01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:03.000
And it wasn't till Menard
when I realized what that...

1353
01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
When I realized
what that meant.

1354
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.000
'Cause in order
to survive in there.

1355
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
a part of me had to die. man.

1356
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:21.000
You couldn't have told me that.
when I got out.

1357
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
that I have...

1358
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000
That I'd had
every reason to live.

1359
01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
So. do you regret it?

1360
01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Do you?

1361
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Uh...

1362
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.000
I wanna... I wanna
share somethin' with you.

1363
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.000
"Like the masses. I was in awe.

1364
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:10.000
when I first laid eyes
on all the things you are.

1365
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
I heard that speech.

1366
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.000
and when that indent
pierced your cheek.

1367
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000
I knew we'd make noise.

1368
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.000
I just... I thought
it'd be in the streets.

1369
01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.000
What magic a philistine
and a poet could create."

1370
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.000
A philistine?
Who you callin' a philistine?

1371
01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000
You're seriously
interrupting me right now?

1372
01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:41.000
"What magic a philistine
and a poet could create.

1373
01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.000
However contradictory.
it would seem that it's fate.

1374
01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:53.000
We educate. we nurture.
we feed. and we lobby.

1375
01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Perhaps we're here for more
than just war

1376
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Let's go!

1377
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.000
"Will my comrades
think me treasonous?

1378
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Can it please
have your dimples?

1379
01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Will my chairman
look at me differently?

1380
01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Will its eyes
have your twinkle?

1381
01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Will our child be
the apple of his eye?

1382
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Or constantly
get the compromise?

1383
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:36.000
The rata-tat-tat of gunfire.
the clink of jail cells.

1384
01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
We scream.

1385
01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:45.000
and we shout.
and we live by this anthem.

1386
01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.000
but is power to the people
really worth that ransom?

1387
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.000
'Cause that's
what a mother does.

1388
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:55.000
She gives the world
the most precious things

1389
01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.000
And I love you.
and I love our baby. too.

1390
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:03.000
and there's nothing
more radical

1391
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Born pure to the blood.
with the heart of a Panther.

1392
01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
So. no regrets.

1393
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
I know my answer."

1394
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Oh. shit.

1395
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Please.

1396
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Please.

1397
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Please.

1398
01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
-Please. no!
-

1399
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Hey!

1400
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

1401
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Hey. Hey. don't shoot me.
Don't shoot.

1402
01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Please don't kill me.
Don't kill me.

1403
01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000
I'm not a rat.
I'm not a rat. I swear.

1404
01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Thank you.

1405
01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000
You're welcome.

1406
01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Do you want me to get that?

1407
01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:59.000
It's probably
one of them crank callers.

1408
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.000
As if it ain't bad enough
I'll never see my son again.

1409
01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.000
You think the mothers
of those police officers

1410
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:09.000
that killed the Soto brothers
are getting harassed like this?

1411
01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Please.

1412
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
I know what you're gonna say.
but...

1413
01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000
No. No. stop. Stop that.

1414
01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
I'm sorry. Mrs. Winters.

1415
01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Let's talk about

1416
01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:40.000
How's Deborah?

1417
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Tired of being pregnant.

1418
01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Yeah.

1419
01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Yeah.

1420
01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Tell her to cherish it.

1421
01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000
All of it.

1422
01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Those early days are...

1423
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:05.000
You know. even when I think
about Jake in my mind.

1424
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
he's always seven.

1425
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
That's how I remember him.

1426
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
My little boy.

1427
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:19.000
I remember.
one time in church. he said...

1428
01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
"Mama. may I be excused?"

1429
01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
I said. "Why. Jake?"

1430
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.000
You know. figuring he was bored
or something.

1431
01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:31.000
And he goes.
"Mama. I gotta pass gas."

1432
01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Sound like Jake.

1433
01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Yeah.

1434
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Yeah.

1435
01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
So well-behaved.

1436
01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Just the sweetest little thing.

1437
01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Mmm.

1438
01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Those folks. though.

1439
01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:08.000
they try to paint my Jake
as some cold-blooded killer.

1440
01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:14.000
He did that.

1441
01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:19.000
But that ain't all he did.

1442
01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Tell 'em about my Jake.
Chairman.

1443
01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.000
I will do.

1444
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Please.

1445
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Yes.

1446
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:44.000
It don't seem fair
that that's his legacy.

1447
01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Here.

1448
01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
C-4.

1449
01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Yeah. we got enough there.

1450
01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
we could blow up city hall.
some more shit.

1451
01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Fuck is wrong with you?

1452
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Calm down. comrade. calm down.

1453
01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
What you mean.
what's wrong with me. man?

1454
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Are y'all fuckin' crazy?
We're not gonna win this war.

1455
01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.000
so we gotta do somethin' big
and we gotta do it now!

1456
01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
You out your mind?

1457
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Man. "complete satisfaction."
ain't that what the fuck

1458
01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
"Kill 'em all.
complete satisfaction."

1459
01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
But I didn't mean it like that.

1460
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
-I did not mean it like that.
-I call you "comrade"

1461
01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
You're the one
that gave me the game. man!

1462
01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Know Jimmy Palmer?

1463
01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:32.000
All right.
you remember Little Bobby?

1464
01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Franko Diggs? Thomas Lewis?

1465
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Bunchy Carter? Jake Winters?

1466
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:43.000
All you lookin' to do
is add more names to that list.

1467
01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.000
You bomb city hall.
they gonna bomb us.

1468
01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
I'm ready to die
for the people. Chairman.

1469
01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.000
How about you?

1470
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Is it a goddamn revolution
or what?

1471
01:32:58.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Huh?

1472
01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.000
Get this shit
the fuck outta here!

1473
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Why the fuck is we doin' it?

1474
01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
What are we
doin' this shit for?

1475
01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Get this shit
the fuck outta here.

1476
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
-Get the fuck on. man!
-Go!

1477
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Well. then fuck it. then!
I'm out!

1478
01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
This whole shit gonna crumble!

1479
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Motherfucker!

1480
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Fuck is you talkin' about.
nigga?

1481
01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
God damn it!

1482
01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Shit.

1483
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000
FBI.
how may I direct your call?

1484
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Uh. Special Agent Carlyle
for Director Hoover.

1485
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Hello.

1486
01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Director Hoover.
good afternoon. sir.

1487
01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:21.000
I am calling with good news.
With great news.

1488
01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Two hours ago.

1489
01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.000
the Illinois Supreme Court
denied Hampton's appeal.

1490
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:28.000
He's going back to Menard.

1491
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
I know.

1492
01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Well. that's what we wanted.
right?

1493
01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Prison made Huey Newton
a celebrity.

1494
01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:46.000
It made Eldridge Cleaver
a best-selling author.

1495
01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Prison is a temporary solution.

1496
01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
What you doing?

1497
01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Goin' through old shit.

1498
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.000
My mom used to babysit him.
you know?

1499
01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Not all the time.

1500
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
but his family lived
across the street.

1501
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.000
so every now and then.
she'd watch him.

1502
01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:25.000
We didn't go to the funeral.
It was too much for her.

1503
01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:28.000
I don't even think
I saw the photo

1504
01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.000
But I remember when I did.

1505
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Thinkin'.
"There's people in this world

1506
01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Or my brother?

1507
01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Or my sister?"

1508
01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:47.000
That's when I knew
I had to protect 'em.

1509
01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.000
I mean. looking at that photo.
how could you

1510
01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:02.000
About to go back to Menard.

1511
01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:06.000
Where I won't be able
to protect anybody.

1512
01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Not even my own son.

1513
01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
The party will protect him.

1514
01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:18.000
You hear me?

1515
01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
The people will protect him.

1516
01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Here. take this.

1517
01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Yes. sir.

1518
01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Hey. Roy boy.

1519
01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
How are you?

1520
01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Look. man. sorry I'm late.
I just. you know...

1521
01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
How's it goin'?

1522
01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
It's groovy. right?

1523
01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
What can I do for you. Roy?

1524
01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:17.000
You've been
to Hampton's apartment. right?

1525
01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Right.

1526
01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:19.000
A lot of guns there?

1527
01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Of course.

1528
01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Good. I need you to draw me
a blueprint of the place.

1529
01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Uh. you must not...

1530
01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Fred's goin' back
to Menard. man.

1531
01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Uh. I think it was
his appeal getting revoked

1532
01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
No. I'm aware.

1533
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:43.000
All right. well.
if you're aware. then. um.

1534
01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:48.000
You don't have
to understand. Bill.

1535
01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
You just have to draw me
that blueprint.

1536
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:04.000
-Listen. Roy.
-Uh-huh.

1537
01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:09.000
You got him. man.
You know. you won.

1538
01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Fred's...

1539
01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:15.000
What more do you want?

1540
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
Are you gonna kill him. Roy?

1541
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Huh?

1542
01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:44.000
I saw you. you know.

1543
01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.000
What?

1544
01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
That day at the speech.

1545
01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
I watched you.

1546
01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:57.000
I remember thinking to myself.
"Either this guy

1547
01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.000
deserves an Academy Award.

1548
01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
or he really
believes this shit."

1549
01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Hey. come on. man. now.
I was doin' my goddamn...

1550
01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
I was doin' the job
that you told me to do.

1551
01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
I was doin'
what the fuck you said.

1552
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.000
-The fuck
are you talkin' about. man?

1553
01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Let's say I put a call
in to New Haven PD.

1554
01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:19.000
get 'em to send me
a few snapshots

1555
01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Alex Rackley.

1556
01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
after they dragged him
from the river.

1557
01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
cigarette burns
all over his body.

1558
01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
skin peeling off.

1559
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:31.000
where the Panthers
poured boiling water

1560
01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
If they did that to Rackley.

1561
01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
imagine what they'll do

1562
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:46.000
when they find out
their security captain

1563
01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:52.000
A fucking rat.

1564
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Fuck. Roy.

1565
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
They name
all these ships. like  Apollo

1566
01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:29.000
after Black people.
but ain't no Black astronauts.

1567
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Well. I like seein' you smile.

1568
01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.000
How about we continue this
at my pad?

1569
01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Have a nightcap.

1570
01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:43.000
I got more than enough alcohol.
you know?

1571
01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
All right.

1572
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Hi.

1573
01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.000
I'm Darlene.

1574
01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Bill.

1575
01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.000
What brings you out
so late. Bill?

1576
01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:03.000
You know. it's quiet.
Nobody know who the hell I am.

1577
01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:04.000
-Mm-hmm.
-You know?

1578
01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Mysterious.

1579
01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:12.000
So. what do you do.
Mystery Man?

1580
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:16.000
-I used to work for the FBI.
-

1581
01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Top me off
while I run to the ladies'.

1582
01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.000
They let niggas
work for the FBI now?

1583
01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
Is that right?
Why don't you get me

1584
01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.000
Mr. FBI man. huh?

1585
01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Hey. man.
Would you shut the fuck up?

1586
01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
-Hey. hey. hey!
-God damn it.

1587
01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Mitchell warned me about you.

1588
01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
What?

1589
01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Yeah.

1590
01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:55.000
What?

1591
01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Look here. just relax.

1592
01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Okay. we hidin' in plain sight.
Nobody know we in here.

1593
01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Check this out. man.
I got this article

1594
01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:12.000
Yeah. right. it's the article
in this paper. Very important.

1595
01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
I need you to let the Chairman
read it tomorrow night.

1596
01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
And put that in his drink.

1597
01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
I don't know what the fuck
you talkin' about. man.

1598
01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Fuck outta here with that shit.

1599
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
My mistake.
-All articles and shit. man.

1600
01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
No. no. it's all good.
that's my mistake.

1601
01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:40.000
No. I guess I had
the wrong guy.

1602
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Sorry about that.

1603
01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Lemme get outta here.

1604
01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:10.000
Hey! Hey!

1605
01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Who are you. man?

1606
01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:14.000
Hey.
don't worry about it. slick.

1607
01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Nigga.
I'm not gonna poison him.

1608
01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
-You fuckin' hear me?
-

1609
01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Come on. man.
you watch too many movies.

1610
01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
Look. all it's gonna do
is just make him sleepy.

1611
01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
You want him to go easy. right?

1612
01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Who the fuck are you. man?
Tell me your fuckin' name!

1613
01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:33.000
You know... Did Roy send you?

1614
01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:36.000
If you a Fed.
then show me a fuckin' badge!

1615
01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Hey! Show me
a fuckin' badge. man!

1616
01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Shit.

1617
01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Consider that a gift...

1618
01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
from the Crowns.

1619
01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Ain't no shame in runnin'.

1620
01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
It's not like
they giving you a choice.

1621
01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Yeah. maybe he's right.
Chairman.

1622
01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Go overseas.

1623
01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Like you said.
start an international

1624
01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
At least that way.
you're still in the fight.

1625
01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
So. what about Cuba?

1626
01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Nuh-uh.

1627
01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Cuba's not an option?
Why not?

1628
01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.000
Algeria.

1629
01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Shit.

1630
01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Mark Clark.
Deputy Minister of Defense.

1631
01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Central ordered me
to come down here

1632
01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:32.000
to check out
how y'all do things.

1633
01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:33.000
here in the Windy City.

1634
01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Yeah.

1635
01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:38.000
And your name. comrade?

1636
01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Bill.

1637
01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Bill?
-Mm-hmm.

1638
01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Bill.
What cadre are you in. Bill?

1639
01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Man. I'm not even in no...

1640
01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Thinking about joining up?

1641
01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Right on. Right on. Bill.

1642
01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:53.000
You know. I started off
in the NAACP myself.

1643
01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Then I had to leave.

1644
01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Them Negroes
move too damn slow for me.

1645
01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:58.000
I know a guy.

1646
01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Kites up checks. passports.

1647
01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:01.000
driver's licenses.
things of that nature.

1648
01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:05.000
Yeah. but how far we gonna get
when one of us

1649
01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
You could be in Havana
in less than 24 hours.

1650
01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
And they have some of
the best doctors in the world.

1651
01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Yeah. okay. let's just hope

1652
01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:14.000
that Nixon decides
to nuke that motherfucker.

1653
01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Look. Algeria.
they got Minister Eldridge.

1654
01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Not to mention bungalows
by the sea.

1655
01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.000
But the Cubans
got ocean for days.

1656
01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
You know how long it'll take
to get to Algeria?

1657
01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
That Cuba's
a hop and a skip away.

1658
01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:29.000
There is a network
of safe houses headin' south.

1659
01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
I could put a call
into Central.

1660
01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Y'all spendin' all this time
talkin' about me

1661
01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.000
when you need
to be talkin' about

1662
01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
how we gonna build
this motherfuckin'

1663
01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Is the party about me
or is it about the people?

1664
01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Hmm?

1665
01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Chairman...

1666
01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
It's a 5-year bid.

1667
01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:10.000
You know how many people
we could save in five years?

1668
01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:15.000
With a medical clinic
in the middle of the West Side?

1669
01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
As far as I'm concerned.
that's an easy decision.

1670
01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:25.000
Doc.

1671
01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:29.000
You run it.

1672
01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Name it after Jake.

1673
01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
So. when people hear
the name Jake Winters.

1674
01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
they think about healin'.

1675
01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:49.000
And lovin'.

1676
01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Like he loved us.

1677
01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
And when I get out.

1678
01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:09.000
me and Deb can have our second.

1679
01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
And third.

1680
01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:21.000
-and fourth...
-Okay. Easy now.

1681
01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
I was gonna cap it
at five. baby.

1682
01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
How 'bout we see how you do
with the one?

1683
01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Mm-hmm.

1684
01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Speaking of children. Chairman.
I'm gonna go

1685
01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Take care. comrade.

1686
01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
All right.
See you in the morning.

1687
01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:41.000
Comrade.

1688
01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Right. Come on. baby. you eat.

1689
01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Come on.
This'll get you strong.

1690
01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:02.000
-This'll raise the blood.
-That's way too much.

1691
01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Oh. what? What?

1692
01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:05.000
That's too much.

1693
01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
What's up?

1694
01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:17.000
I thought I'd get
another drink.

1695
01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
You want a refill. Chairman?

1696
01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:56.000
Hey. Hey. Wake up.

1697
01:50:58.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Look.

1698
01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Hey. Hey.

1699
01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
-Wake up.

1700
01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:12.000
Somebody at the door.

1701
01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
Hey. Tracy.

1702
01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000

1708
01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:50.000

Wake up! Wake up! Chairman!

1714
01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
Turn on the fucking lights!

1715
01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
We can't!
We've been shot!

1716
01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Turn on the light

1717
01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Come on. come on!

1718
01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:28.000

We're comin' out!

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Come here! Come here!

1721
01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
How many are in there?

1722
01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:51.000
Just stop shootin'!
Stop shootin'!

1723
01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
We got a pregnant sister
in here. God damn it!

1724
01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
Everyone out! Now!

1725
01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
I said now!

1726
01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
Get over here!

1727
01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
Keep those hands up!

1728
01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:37.000
What do you know?
We got a broad here.

1729
01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Take her!

1730
01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Come here!

1731
01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Get her.

1732
01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:49.000
Looks like
he's gonna make it.

1733
01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
He's good and dead now.

1734
01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
Bill.

1735
01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Good to see ya.
Come on in.

1736
01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
Hey. Relax...

1737
01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:36.000
it's just us.
I know you don't trust me.

1738
01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Why'd you call me here. man?
What do you want?

1739
01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Hey?

1740
01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Take it.

1741
01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
You don't have to
if you don't want to.

1742
01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:13.000
but I think
you'll be glad you did.

1743
01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:33.000
They're for a gas station
in Maywood.

1744
01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
It's yours.

1745
01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:42.000
There's a lot of money in gas.
Consistent money.

1746
01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
Legal money.

1747
01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:48.000
You own
your own business now. Bill.

1748
01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.000
You're free.

1749
01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
What do you need?
You need a drink?

1750
01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:00.000
-No. I don't need anythin'...
-You need a drink?

1751
01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:01.000
-Excuse me.
- Fuck.

1752
01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Can you get this man
a scotch?

1753
01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:10.000
So. where are things
with the party?

1754
01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Any news?

1755
01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:18.000
Fred's dead. man.

1756
01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:21.000
I ain't no goddamn Panther
no more.

1757
01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
You sure about that?

1758
01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:15.000
What would you tell your son

1759
01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:24.000
I think I'll let
your documentary

1760
01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:26.000
I don't know.

1761
01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
I don't know what I'd tell him.
other than...

1762
01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
I was part of the struggle.

1763
01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
That's the bottom line.

1764
01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
I wasn't one of those
armchair revolutionaries.

1765
01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:41.000
One of those people
that wanna sit back now

1766
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:45.000
and judge the actions
or inactions of people

1767
01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:49.000
when they sit back
on the sideline

1768
01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:52.000
At least I had a point of view.

1769
01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:53.000
I was dedicated.

1770
01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:56.000
And then I had the courage
to get out there

1771
01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
and put it on the line.
and I did.

1772
01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Um...

1773
01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:04.000
I think I'll let history
speak for me.

1774
01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:10.000
Stoppin' down.

1775
01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:13.000
Call when it's speed.

1776
01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
Remember this.

1777
01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:58.000
Prayer is good.

1778
01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:03.000
If Fred could be murdered
while he slept.

1779
01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:06.000
remember
what can happen to you.

1780
01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:09.000
while you're on your knees
facing that bed.

1781
01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:18.000
-

1782
01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:26.000
-

1783
01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
through the head

1784
01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
through the head

1785
01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:33.000
-

1786
01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:41.000
-

1787
01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
-

1788
01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
-

1789
01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
-

1790
01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:50.000
-

1791
01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:53.000
-

1792
01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:57.000
-

1793
01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:01.000
-

1794
02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
-

1795
02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
-

1796
02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:12.000
-

1797
02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
We've got
The free-breakfast program

1798
02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
We always say
at the Black Panther Party.

1799
02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
that they can do
what they want to. to us.

1800
02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:27.000
we might not be back.
I might be in jail.

1801
02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
but when I leave.
you can remember I said.

1802
02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:32.000
with the last words
out of my lips. that I am...

1803
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:33.000
I am!

1804
02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:34.000
...a revolutionary.

1805
02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
And you're going to have to
keep on saying that.

1806
02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
You are going to have to say
that I am a proletariat.

1807
02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
I am the people.

1808
02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
I'm not the pig.
You've got to make

1809
02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
When they stare

1810
02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:38.000
From your hands

1811
02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
'Cause they judge us

1812
02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
From the leaders keepin' us

1813
02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:51.000
Gonna keep us strong

1814
02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
If you're just long gone

1815
02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:04.000
There's no one like you

1816
02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:10.000
We could never lose

1817
02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:15.000
Always fight for you

1818
02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Always fight for you

1819
02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:48.000
Is a new revolution

1820
02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:53.000
No. it can't be ignored

1821
02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Will you be ready for war?

1822
02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:02.000
'Cause they need us

1823
02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
Hang from the trees

1824
02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:16.000
They're aiming

1825
02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:21.000
They're gonna see it through

1826
02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:25.000
There's no one like you

1827
02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:31.000
We could never lose

1828
02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:36.000
Always fight for you

1829
02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Always fight for you

1830
02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:50.000
There's no one like you

1831
02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:56.000
Always fight for you

1832
02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:01.000
Fight for you
