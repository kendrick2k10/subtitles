515
00:27:17.458 --> 00:27:19.333
[both chewing loudly]

516
00:27:19.416 --> 00:27:21.666
Okay. so listen up.

517
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.500
Ben's agreed to work in here
while. uh. he's tracking Jess.

518
00:27:25.583 --> 00:27:27.250
so just give him
a bit of space. all right?

519
00:27:31.708 --> 00:27:34.333
[Hannah] In your dreams…
[continues indistinctly]

520
00:27:37.333 --> 00:27:38.500
What is all this stuff?

521
00:27:38.583 --> 00:27:40.125
Don't touch anything.

522
00:27:40.208 --> 00:27:42.708
-Then don't touch my Weet-Bix.
-Fine.

523
00:27:42.791 --> 00:27:44.125
-[map thuds]
-Fine.

524
00:27:45.208 --> 00:27:46.791
[Roger sighs] All right.

525
00:27:54.125 --> 00:27:56.083
[phone dialing]

526
00:27:56.916 --> 00:27:58.250
-[rings]
-[Emily] Is that Jessica?

527
00:27:58.333 --> 00:28:00.500
-[Julie] I got it! I got it.
-[Tom] Mine. mine. mine!

528
00:28:00.583 --> 00:28:01.416
[Roger] Hey. mate.

529
00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:06.958
27 degrees. 33 minutes south.
and 170 degrees. 30 minutes east.

530
00:28:07.541 --> 00:28:08.875
-[knocks on table]
-Spot on.

531
00:28:09.375 --> 00:28:11.375
[sighs] How are the supplies.
do you have enough?

532
00:28:11.458 --> 00:28:13.166
[chuckles] <i>Dad. I only just left.</i>

533
00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:15.625
-Okay.
-Uh… Oh. no. Jules! Oh. my--

534
00:28:16.708 --> 00:28:17.625
Jess!

535
00:28:18.125 --> 00:28:19.333
[Jess] <i>Hi. Mum!</i>

536
00:28:19.416 --> 00:28:21.958
[chuckles] How's it feel out there?

537
00:28:23.875 --> 00:28:25.250
[Jess] Worth the wait.

538
00:28:25.333 --> 00:28:27.333
[gentle cheerful music plays]

539
00:28:33.125 --> 00:28:34.291
[grunts]

540
00:28:41.208 --> 00:28:42.333
Chuck the rope.

541
00:28:42.875 --> 00:28:43.791
[Ben] Ugh.

542
00:28:44.666 --> 00:28:45.541
I got it.

543
00:28:48.791 --> 00:28:49.791
Just do it!

544
00:28:55.208 --> 00:28:56.375
[Ben grunts softly]

545
00:29:09.041 --> 00:29:10.333
Is that acceptable?

546
00:29:10.833 --> 00:29:12.625
Yep. Thanks. kid.

547
00:29:13.916 --> 00:29:16.666
No one thinks I'm big
or strong enough to do anything.

548
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.166
But I am!

549
00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:21.958
I practice all the time.
whenever I get the chance.

550
00:29:22.458 --> 00:29:24.625
You don't have to prove
anything to me. mate.

551
00:29:25.125 --> 00:29:27.125
Well. that's what girls have to do.

552
00:29:28.791 --> 00:29:30.708
Are you Ben Bryant?

553
00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.458
-No.
-Yes. you are.

554
00:29:33.541 --> 00:29:37.458
You lost the tip of your pinky finger
sailing in Antarctica.

555
00:29:40.458 --> 00:29:41.500
I didn't lose it.

556
00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:45.375
-I put it in the drawer.
-Cool.

557
00:29:46.583 --> 00:29:51.250
You've done 12 Sydney to Hobarts
and circumnavigated solo three times.

558
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.500
Is solo sailing good?

559
00:29:53.583 --> 00:29:55.291
Yeah. it's great.

560
00:29:55.375 --> 00:29:56.833
No one talks to you.

561
00:29:58.583 --> 00:30:01.000
I'm trying to get experience
so I can sail the world.

562
00:30:01.083 --> 00:30:02.875
but no one's giving me a chance to.

563
00:30:03.833 --> 00:30:04.750
So?

564
00:30:05.708 --> 00:30:07.125
Make your own chance.

565
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.541
Hi. I'm Jess.

566
00:30:13.625 --> 00:30:15.041
Welcome to my video log!

567
00:30:15.125 --> 00:30:16.875
Traditionally. sailors keep log books.

568
00:30:16.958 --> 00:30:20.375
but you can't deprive me
of screen time for half a year. [chuckles]

569
00:30:20.458 --> 00:30:24.041
I'm sure it'll just be my mum
watching. though. Hi. Mum!

570
00:30:24.125 --> 00:30:25.291
[chuckles]

571
00:30:25.375 --> 00:30:29.375
I thought I'd give you a tour
of my home for the next seven months. so…

572
00:30:30.541 --> 00:30:32.750
Here's my kitchen where I'll be cooking.

573
00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:37.750
And here is the nav table where I control
all the electrics and communication.

574
00:30:37.833 --> 00:30:40.416
Uh. my berth. where I'll sleep.

575
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:41.375
Oh.

576
00:30:41.458 --> 00:30:43.125
[clicks tongue] Dunny.

577
00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:46.166
Uh. and this is where all my food is.

578
00:30:46.958 --> 00:30:48.250
For example…

579
00:30:49.125 --> 00:30:52.166
[dryly] Oh. my God. freeze-dried broccoli.

580
00:30:54.875 --> 00:30:55.791
[chuckles dryly]

581
00:30:57.041 --> 00:30:58.166
Nice one. Dad.

582
00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:01.625
So I'll be sailing unassisted and nonstop.

583
00:31:01.708 --> 00:31:03.875
So if I pull into port. I'm disqualified.

584
00:31:03.958 --> 00:31:07.541
And I have to cross all lines of longitude
and round all four capes

585
00:31:07.625 --> 00:31:10.125
for it to count
as a true circumnavigation.

586
00:31:10.791 --> 00:31:14.041
Here's what I'll be doing.
Okay. here's Sydney.

587
00:31:14.125 --> 00:31:16.291
Going northeast. up past the equator.

588
00:31:16.375 --> 00:31:19.791
then back down south
to round Cape Horn at the tip of Chile.

589
00:31:19.875 --> 00:31:25.166
then across the Atlantic Ocean
to the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa.

590
00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:30.666
then over the Indian Ocean
to Cape Leeuwin in Western Australia.

591
00:31:31.166 --> 00:31:35.125
then down around
the South East Cape in Tasmania.

592
00:31:35.208 --> 00:31:36.708
and back up to Sydney Harbor.

593
00:31:37.958 --> 00:31:39.750
So not so much really. [chuckles]

594
00:31:43.041 --> 00:31:44.041
Come on!

595
00:31:44.125 --> 00:31:47.833
All right. so this is the tiller to steer.

596
00:31:47.916 --> 00:31:50.041
but it's on autopilot at the moment.

597
00:31:50.125 --> 00:31:54.458
Uh. the lifeboat is under here.
and in here is the drogue.

598
00:31:54.958 --> 00:31:56.958
It's like a soft anchor.

599
00:31:57.041 --> 00:32:00.500
It slows the boat down during storms
and keeps it stable.

600
00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:03.458
Here's my shower.

601
00:32:04.083 --> 00:32:07.958
although I have discovered
that I left my hairbrush at home.

602
00:32:08.041 --> 00:32:11.125
So I'll just have to use this
for 200 days.

603
00:32:12.166 --> 00:32:14.416
At least the backyard
makes up for it. though.

604
00:32:33.291 --> 00:32:34.500
Hungry. Kobi?

605
00:32:36.375 --> 00:32:38.875
[line tensing. reel clicks]

606
00:32:42.458 --> 00:32:43.750
[phone rings]

607
00:32:43.833 --> 00:32:44.708
Oh.

608
00:32:45.458 --> 00:32:46.916
-Jess.
-Hey.

609
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.791
Uh. ship detection alarms work.

610
00:32:49.375 --> 00:32:52.000
[clicks tongue] Uh.
one just went past northwest of me.

611
00:32:52.083 --> 00:32:53.041
Good to know.

612
00:32:53.958 --> 00:32:56.375
Well. that'll be the last ship
you see for a while now.

613
00:32:57.375 --> 00:32:58.333
How do you know?

614
00:33:01.375 --> 00:33:02.208
Listen.

615
00:33:03.291 --> 00:33:05.208
let that crash be a lesson to you. eh?

616
00:33:06.625 --> 00:33:08.125
<i>You know how to handle it now.</i>

617
00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:14.916
-Did you ever get lonely?
-Oh. sometimes.

618
00:33:15.875 --> 00:33:18.791
-But I know how to get over it.
-How?

619
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.666
-Sing.
-Sing?

620
00:33:22.166 --> 00:33:23.083
You-- You sang?

621
00:33:23.166 --> 00:33:25.458
We're sailors.
That's what we're supposed to do.

622
00:33:25.541 --> 00:33:27.750
[gentle enchanting music plays]

623
00:33:27.833 --> 00:33:29.416
[Ben] <i>Try to get some sleep. eh?</i>

624
00:33:30.333 --> 00:33:33.541
You've just got the first-week jitters.
that's all. Oh! Fish are calling.

625
00:33:33.625 --> 00:33:34.583
-Gotta go.
<i>-Okay.</i>

626
00:33:36.708 --> 00:33:37.625
Come on.

627
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:40.083
[line snaps]

628
00:33:40.166 --> 00:33:41.625
Oh. bugger!

645
00:34:57.791 --> 00:35:01.916
Okay. so crossing the equator
is a big deal for sailors.

646
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.291
You've proven your seaworthiness
and must be initiated

647
00:35:04.375 --> 00:35:06.041
into the Fraternity of Mariners.

648
00:35:07.125 --> 00:35:08.250

South. twenty. fifteen.
ten. five. zero! [laughs]

650

for the initiation ceremony…

[Julie] I can't believe
she's crossed the equator.

660
00:35:51.041 --> 00:35:51.958
So cool.

00:36:02.208 --> 00:36:04.333
[Jess sighs] Red sky at night.
sailor's delight.

662

See the forecast?

667
00:36:17.916 --> 00:36:19.208
Yeah. sky says it all.

668
00:36:20.791 --> 00:36:24.916
Yeah. Jess. this is gonna be a big one.
Let's talk game. eh?

669
00:36:26.666 --> 00:36:28.083
I'll change course.

670
00:36:28.166 --> 00:36:31.000
I think you should launch the drogue.

671
00:36:31.708 --> 00:36:32.541
Weather it.

Well. it's moving fast.
There's no way you're gonna outrun it.

674
00:36:39.958 --> 00:36:41.916
But that also means
it's gonna pass quickly.

675
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.708
-Thank God.
-W-- Hang on. hang on.

676
00:36:43.791 --> 00:36:45.666
We agreed to do whatever's safest.

677
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:48.750
Storms in this region aren't common. Dad.
It's hard to judge.

[Ben] It's like an anchor.

679
00:36:51.708 --> 00:36:54.833
The drogue will keep her stable.
She'll be okay.

680
00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.333
I think it's our best option. Jess.

681
00:36:59.000 --> 00:36:59.833
It's your call.

682
00:37:04.833 --> 00:37:05.666

859
00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.583
Merry Christmas. Ben!

860
00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:03.000
-Merry Christmas. Ben!
-Yeah.

861
00:48:04.208 --> 00:48:05.708
Merry Christmas. mate.

862

All right. it's a bit loud.
I'm gonna go now.

868

Everybody say goodbye to Jess!

-Yeah. Cheers.

Come on. you lot.

Ben. what do you usually do for Christmas?

886
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:11.833
Nothing.

887
00:49:13.291 --> 00:49:14.458
What about your family?

888
00:49:14.958 --> 00:49:17.583
Oh. Uh. don't have one.

889
00:49:21.208 --> 00:49:22.041
Oh.

Open it. open it!

893
00:49:51.875 --> 00:49:52.875
[Ben] Thank you.

894
00:49:54.791 --> 00:49:57.708
[Hannah] Ben. why is Cape Horn
such a big deal?

895
00:49:57.791 --> 00:49:58.916
Oh! Well…

896
00:49:59.875 --> 00:50:01.666
That is some wicked sailing.

897
00:50:02.416 --> 00:50:06.166
See. that's where the Atlantic
and Pacific Oceans meet.

898
00:50:06.250 --> 00:50:09.875
so you get these powerful winds.

899
00:50:09.958 --> 00:50:11.458
these churning currents.

900
00:50:11.541 --> 00:50:13.916
these humongous waves

901
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.083

[Julie chuckles politely]

903
00:50:17.541 --> 00:50:18.750
That's why that passage

904
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:21.000
is so sinister.

905
00:50:22.083 --> 00:50:27.375
It's absolutely littered
with a long-lost trail of fingertips.

-Hmm?

908
00:50:32.166 --> 00:50:34.041
Uh. could you maybe be
a little less excited

909
00:50:34.125 --> 00:50:35.916
about our daughter
doing something sinister?

910
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:36.958
All right.

911
00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:40.208

[Ben] Oh! Whoa.

917
00:51:06.541 --> 00:51:09.083
Look how fast she's going. Bloody hell.

918
00:51:09.166 --> 00:51:10.500
[Roger clears throat]

919
00:51:10.583 --> 00:51:13.416
Oh. not-- not too fast. It's…

920
00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:16.000
-[Tom] She's going quick.
-[Ben inhales sharply]

921

-Whoa.
-Come on!

922
00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:21.500
We just rounded the Everest
of the ocean. Cape Horn.

923
00:51:21.583 --> 00:51:24.250
and I am happy to report
it was smooth sailing.

Do you hear that?

928
00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:50.875
It's the sound of nothing.

929
00:51:52.625 --> 00:51:53.875
Nothing at all.

930
00:51:56.375 --> 00:51:59.041
There's no wind or waves.

931
00:51:59.750 --> 00:52:01.125

I'm gonna sail around the world
and I'm hiring you as my coach.

940
00:52:27.708 --> 00:52:30.750
Tell your parents there's plenty
of coaches at the sailing school.

941
00:52:30.833 --> 00:52:32.375
I know. but I want you to do it.

942
00:52:33.208 --> 00:52:34.250
Well…

943
00:52:36.041 --> 00:52:37.541
I don't sail anymore.

944
00:52:37.625 --> 00:52:39.958
Because of the Millennium Cup. I know.

945
00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:45.291
But if you help

Hey. why-- why do you want
to do this. anyway?

more people in space

953

than have sailed around the world.

954
00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:12.500
I didn't even know it was something
you can do. but you can. and I want to.

You like sailing.

Circumnavigating the globe
is a whole different thing. mate.

958
00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:26.208
Well. that's what I want
to find out for myself.

959
00:53:29.708 --> 00:53:31.833
You're gonna do this
no matter what I say. aren't you?

960
00:53:34.375 --> 00:53:38.208
If I was going to agree to this.
I'm not gonna treat you special.

961

'cause it doesn't matter out there.

Oi! First rule…

964
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:49.833

Yeah. I was asleep.
