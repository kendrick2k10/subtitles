00:00:18.583 --> 00:00:21.250
Inspired by the YouTube short film
"Waktu Maghrib"

4
00:00:23.542 --> 00:00:26.250
"Thou shalt not release your cattle
or your children

5
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:28.958
from when the sun sets
until the early evening passes.

6
00:00:29.042 --> 00:00:31.417
for evil comes out in these hours."

7
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.875
Sahih Imam Muslim. No. 2113

8
00:00:37.417 --> 00:00:39.750
One. two. three.

9
00:00:40.417 --> 00:00:42.708
Catch it.

10
00:00:43.417 --> 00:00:44.417
It's too hard.

11
00:00:45.042 --> 00:00:46.750
Can you do it?

12
00:00:50.292 --> 00:00:54.792
-I missed.
-I only got one point.

13
00:00:55.458 --> 00:00:57.958
Come on. two points. One. two. three.

14
00:00:58.042 --> 00:01:01.000
Karta. Drajat. let's go home.

15
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.792
It's already dusk.

16
00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:05.833
-Later.
-Just a couple more minutes.

17
00:01:05.917 --> 00:01:09.083
What? We came out here together.

18
00:01:09.167 --> 00:01:11.125
We should go home together too.

19
00:01:11.208 --> 00:01:13.250
What if I get kidnapped by a ghost?

20
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:16.375
You shouldn't believe in superstitions.

21
00:01:16.458 --> 00:01:18.208
-Boo!
-Boo!

22
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:23.333
Whatever.

23
00:01:28.292 --> 00:01:31.250
Two points.

24
00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:34.292
This is the second.

25
00:01:34.375 --> 00:01:36.042
-Ready?
-Ready.

26
00:01:49.125 --> 00:01:51.917
-Gotcha.
-Best two out of three.

27
00:02:00.083 --> 00:02:01.542
Where is it?

28
00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.625
Drajat. you hit it so far.

29
00:02:29.125 --> 00:02:32.167
There it is. Found it.

30
00:02:35.458 --> 00:02:37.833
Oh no. It fell.

31
00:02:37.917 --> 00:02:39.833
Damn it.

32
00:02:44.333 --> 00:02:47.792
Let's play!

33
00:02:48.792 --> 00:02:52.208
Let's play!

34
00:02:53.708 --> 00:02:56.417
All night long

35
00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.417
with friends.

36
00:03:03.375 --> 00:03:06.917
Let's play…

37
00:03:08.375 --> 00:03:09.500
Damn.

38
00:03:30.542 --> 00:03:33.500
Help!

39
00:03:33.583 --> 00:03:34.875
Ouch!

40
00:03:37.458 --> 00:03:38.875
Wati!

41
00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.833
Help!

42
00:04:28.792 --> 00:04:31.625
Not again.

43
00:04:31.708 --> 00:04:33.000
30 Years Later

44
00:04:33.083 --> 00:04:36.167
Adi! Adi!

45
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.917
Adi. let's go. We're late.

46
00:04:41.333 --> 00:04:42.833
Okay.

47
00:04:42.917 --> 00:04:44.083
Come on.

48
00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:49.833
Adi. Adi. let's take a shortcut.

49
00:04:49.917 --> 00:04:53.083
No. let's go down the usual route.

50
00:04:53.167 --> 00:04:55.083
Stop thinking so much.
you'll get wrinkles.

51
00:04:55.167 --> 00:04:57.417
-I don't want to! Saman!
-Come on. Adi!

52
00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.042
-Saman.
-Come on.

53
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Adi.

54
00:05:10.792 --> 00:05:13.583
Please. don't hurt us.

55
00:05:14.292 --> 00:05:17.708
Please. please. please.

56
00:05:17.792 --> 00:05:18.833
Please.

57
00:05:19.708 --> 00:05:21.125
Crazy!

58
00:05:27.208 --> 00:05:29.042
JATIJAJAR 01 MIDDLE SCHOOL

59
00:05:35.875 --> 00:05:37.208
-Come on!
-Let's go.

60
00:05:38.792 --> 00:05:40.375
-Come on.
-Okay.

61
00:05:40.458 --> 00:05:42.125
Do you know what time it is?

62
00:05:42.542 --> 00:05:46.917
I've scolded you so many times.
yet you're both still late.

63
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.167
We're sorry.

64
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.375
-Saman and I were just…
-Enough!

65
00:05:50.458 --> 00:05:51.792
No excuses.

66
00:05:51.875 --> 00:05:53.375
Now. get in.

67
00:05:53.458 --> 00:05:57.000
Later. when the others go home.

68
00:05:57.083 --> 00:06:00.167
you two stay back for detention.

69
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.250
Understood?

70
00:06:02.375 --> 00:06:03.500
Get inside.

71
00:06:20.042 --> 00:06:23.500
Always late or missing class.

72
00:06:24.292 --> 00:06:26.208
What do you want?

73
00:06:26.292 --> 00:06:27.833
"I promise I won't be late again."

74
00:06:27.917 --> 00:06:29.750
Do you want to quit school?

75
00:06:29.833 --> 00:06:31.417
Do you want to be expelled?

76
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.958
Is that what you want?

77
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.125
The headmaster is about to hold
a meeting about you.

78
00:06:37.208 --> 00:06:40.792
That's why you need to listen to me.

79
00:06:40.875 --> 00:06:43.458
Don't just let it go in one ear
and out the other.

80
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.667
-Excuse me. Miss Woro.
-Yes. Ayu.

81
00:06:48.708 --> 00:06:50.667
Let me check your work.

82
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.125
-Okay.
-Come here.

83
00:06:59.875 --> 00:07:01.667
Stop messing around.

84
00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:07.125
Good work.

85
00:07:08.125 --> 00:07:12.417
But I can't really read your writing
towards the end.

86
00:07:13.583 --> 00:07:15.000
Well…

87
00:07:15.083 --> 00:07:18.583
My pen ran out of ink. miss.

88
00:07:18.667 --> 00:07:20.958
-I'm sorry.
-Oh. dear.

89
00:07:21.042 --> 00:07:22.125
It's all right.

90
00:07:24.625 --> 00:07:26.875
This is for you.

91
00:07:27.833 --> 00:07:29.167
Thank you. miss.

92
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.458
Study hard. sweet girl.

93
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.125
Keep doing the exercises. okay?

94
00:07:34.208 --> 00:07:38.333
Miss. Can I borrow this book
and return it tomorrow?

95
00:07:38.417 --> 00:07:40.167
Yes. of course.

96
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:41.458
-Excuse me.
-Of course.

97
00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.708
Saman!

98
00:07:47.417 --> 00:07:50.958
-What?
-My dad was looking for you this morning.

99
00:07:55.917 --> 00:07:58.292
Oh no! Adi. I forgot.

100
00:07:59.083 --> 00:08:01.458
Less talking. More writing.

101
00:08:02.542 --> 00:08:06.750
If you don't want
to sell your honey here. just say so.

102
00:08:08.917 --> 00:08:12.458
-Thank you. Mr. Marto.
-Yes. ma'am. You're welcome.

103
00:08:15.292 --> 00:08:17.292
I can just tell Samiun.

104
00:08:18.417 --> 00:08:19.708
So he can teach you a lesson.

105
00:08:19.792 --> 00:08:22.333
Sir. please don't tell Samiun.

106
00:08:22.417 --> 00:08:23.708
I do want to sell.

107
00:08:23.792 --> 00:08:25.583
I just woke up late this morning.

108
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.583
This is your last chance.

109
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.667
If this happens again tomorrow.
I'm telling your brother.

110
00:08:33.833 --> 00:08:36.500
You should feel sorry for him.

111
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.042
He's working so hard for you
and your grandmother.

112
00:08:40.917 --> 00:08:42.333
Don't be lazy.

113
00:08:43.208 --> 00:08:46.167
Laziness is a sin.

114
00:08:48.042 --> 00:08:49.083
Understood?

115
00:08:49.167 --> 00:08:50.167
-Yes.
-Yes.

116
00:08:53.792 --> 00:08:55.500
-Ayu.
-Let's just go. Saman.

117
00:08:55.583 --> 00:08:57.417
Why are you delivering the food now?

118
00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.625
I was doing my history homework earlier.

119
00:09:02.458 --> 00:09:04.833
Make sure you come home before dusk. Ayu.

120
00:09:04.917 --> 00:09:07.000
-Yes. Dad.
-This is all because of that damn teacher.

121
00:09:07.083 --> 00:09:08.792
I forgot to bring the honey.

122
00:09:10.917 --> 00:09:13.125
You're the one who woke up late.

123
00:09:14.208 --> 00:09:16.292
You're the one who played in the river.

124
00:09:16.375 --> 00:09:18.917
You're the one who forgot.
How is it Miss Woro's fault?

125
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.917
Miss Woro means well.

126
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.125
She wants you both to be disciplined.

127
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.167
Teacher's pet.

128
00:09:26.583 --> 00:09:31.417
Come and see the wayang performance.
Muncul Utomo!

129
00:09:32.125 --> 00:09:34.708
Tomorrow night at Jatipeni Village.

130
00:09:35.583 --> 00:09:39.083
You'll definitely be entertained.

131
00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:43.750
Come and see.

132
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.125
We've got to see it. Adi.

133
00:09:55.208 --> 00:09:58.042
I agree. I'll go ask my dad later.

134
00:09:58.125 --> 00:09:59.875
What about your brother?

135
00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.917
Don't worry.

136
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.250
Persuading Mas Samiun is easy.

137
00:10:04.333 --> 00:10:06.042
He only looks scary.

138
00:10:06.125 --> 00:10:08.458
If you beg enough. he'll soften up.

139
00:10:08.542 --> 00:10:10.750
-Relax.
-You sure?

140
00:10:11.542 --> 00:10:12.667
Yeah.

141
00:10:14.125 --> 00:10:15.292
Look. Saman.

142
00:10:16.083 --> 00:10:18.875
I don't like going through the forest
because of that rock.

143
00:10:20.042 --> 00:10:23.958
They said Mr. Karta lost his finger there.

144
00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:27.292
Saman.

145
00:10:30.667 --> 00:10:31.750
Saman?

146
00:10:34.375 --> 00:10:35.583
Saman!

147
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.167
Saman. this is not funny!

148
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:44.458
Saman!

149
00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:48.750
It's not funny.

150
00:10:50.792 --> 00:10:51.917
Saman?

151
00:10:53.875 --> 00:10:55.250
I'll go home without you.

152
00:10:56.458 --> 00:10:57.458
Saman!

153
00:10:57.542 --> 00:10:58.583
Boo!

154
00:11:00.708 --> 00:11:02.042
Dang it!

155
00:11:02.125 --> 00:11:04.542
Come on. don't be mad.

156
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.667
Ghosts don't exist.

157
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.667
Don't believe in superstitions.

158
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:12.708
If a ghost shows up. I will beat it up.

159
00:11:13.667 --> 00:11:14.833
Adi!

160
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.125
Uncle?

161
00:11:36.708 --> 00:11:37.792
Uncle!

162
00:11:44.167 --> 00:11:45.292
Uncle?

163
00:11:47.125 --> 00:11:50.958
-Why are you here?
-I'm just delivering food for you.

164
00:11:51.708 --> 00:11:54.583
Just go home. It's almost dusk.

165
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.292
-Uncle.
-Go home!

166
00:11:56.792 --> 00:11:58.000
Go!

167
00:12:01.458 --> 00:12:04.833
God is Great!

168
00:12:09.792 --> 00:12:15.625
The Prophet said that we should not
be out at the beginning of the night.

169
00:12:17.042 --> 00:12:19.500
-Meaning?
-At dusk. sir.

170
00:12:19.583 --> 00:12:21.167
Good.

171
00:12:21.667 --> 00:12:24.000
Because at dusk.

172
00:12:24.083 --> 00:12:26.458
evil comes out.

173
00:12:26.542 --> 00:12:31.542
But. sir. what if we want
to pray at the mosque?

174
00:12:33.125 --> 00:12:35.750
Good. That's a very good question.

175
00:12:36.708 --> 00:12:39.750
Can anybody answer it?

176
00:12:41.792 --> 00:12:43.417
The answer is.

177
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.500
come earlier to the mosque.

178
00:12:47.458 --> 00:12:50.250
If you can. come before the adhan.

179
00:12:50.333 --> 00:12:53.542
It'll teach you discipline too.

180
00:12:53.625 --> 00:12:57.583
So. let me remind you once again.

181
00:12:57.667 --> 00:13:00.833
Do not leave the house at dusk

182
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:04.542
except when you're going to…?

183
00:13:04.625 --> 00:13:07.125
-The mosque.
-The mosque.

184
00:13:07.208 --> 00:13:08.417
Very good.

185
00:13:20.792 --> 00:13:21.958
Granny.

186
00:13:23.167 --> 00:13:25.583
You should eat. I'll help you.

187
00:13:27.125 --> 00:13:30.958
But it's time for you to eat. Granny.

188
00:13:31.333 --> 00:13:34.000
If you don't.
you won't get better as fast.

189
00:13:51.875 --> 00:13:54.292
-Peace be upon you.
-And also upon you.

190
00:14:10.917 --> 00:14:12.000
Uhm. Samiun.

191
00:14:13.167 --> 00:14:15.917
-Tomorrow. I want to watch…
-Why are these bottles still here?

192
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.625
Did you forget again?

193
00:14:19.625 --> 00:14:20.750
Oh.

194
00:14:21.417 --> 00:14:22.458
I did.

195
00:14:23.417 --> 00:14:25.667
Well. I was planning

196
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:28.083
to take them to Mr. Marto's shop tomorrow.

197
00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:30.167
Along with yesterday's honey.

198
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:31.667
So I don't have to go twice.

199
00:14:39.417 --> 00:14:41.125
Please…

200
00:14:41.208 --> 00:14:43.208
You only had one job to do.

201
00:14:43.292 --> 00:14:45.583
You can't even deliver honey?

202
00:14:45.667 --> 00:14:47.917
Where do you think
your pocket money comes from?

203
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.458
From where?

204
00:14:51.625 --> 00:14:54.125
-Calm down.
-How dare you?!

205
00:14:57.583 --> 00:15:00.917
Enough. Granny.
This is none of your business.

206
00:15:03.667 --> 00:15:04.917
You know what?

207
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.625
This is exactly why
I can't leave for the city. Shit.

208
00:15:35.542 --> 00:15:38.625
If these bottles are still here
by the time I come back.

209
00:15:38.708 --> 00:15:39.917
I really will beat you up.

210
00:16:23.333 --> 00:16:28.208
Dear listeners. in 2002.
after the economic crisis…

211
00:16:28.292 --> 00:16:30.208
-Morning.
-Good morning.

212
00:16:30.292 --> 00:16:31.458
-Take care.
-Yes.

213
00:16:31.542 --> 00:16:34.583
…along with the increase
of quality in security.

214
00:16:36.625 --> 00:16:38.000
-Wait. Saman.
-What?

215
00:16:38.083 --> 00:16:40.458
Why are you carrying bottles
of honey to school?

216
00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:45.792
I was going to take them to Mr. Marto.
but I woke up late.

217
00:16:45.875 --> 00:16:48.458
I'll just ask Miss Woro later.

218
00:16:48.542 --> 00:16:50.542
-Wait.
-I'm sure she'll let me.

219
00:16:50.625 --> 00:16:52.583
-Come on. we're late.
-Okay.

220
00:16:52.667 --> 00:16:54.417
I said no.

221
00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.625
Miss. please. I am begging you.

222
00:16:57.708 --> 00:16:59.958
If I don't deliver the honey today.

223
00:17:00.042 --> 00:17:02.167
my brother will be mad at me.

224
00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:03.583
I don't care.

225
00:17:04.167 --> 00:17:08.708
No matter how much I put you in detention.
you're still late.

226
00:17:08.792 --> 00:17:12.708
Let your brother know
what kind of student you are.

227
00:17:12.792 --> 00:17:14.625
Miss. I am begging you. Please.

228
00:17:14.708 --> 00:17:17.333
I promise. once I am done.

229
00:17:17.417 --> 00:17:19.083
I will go back here
to clean the restrooms.

230
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.375
No.

231
00:17:21.792 --> 00:17:26.125
If the restrooms aren't cleaned.

232
00:17:26.208 --> 00:17:29.792
neither of you is leaving. period.

233
00:17:30.417 --> 00:17:31.583
Come on. miss.

234
00:17:38.583 --> 00:17:41.125
We're gonna miss the wayang show. Saman.

235
00:17:41.208 --> 00:17:43.583
No. Adi. We're going.

236
00:17:43.667 --> 00:17:45.750
You brought clothes with you. right?

237
00:17:45.833 --> 00:17:47.208
How do we get there?

238
00:17:47.292 --> 00:17:50.250
It's almost dusk.
Will there be any transport to Jatipeni?

239
00:17:50.333 --> 00:17:51.375
We have to go.

240
00:17:52.042 --> 00:17:54.375
Otherwise. I'd get a slap
from Samiun for nothing.

241
00:17:58.292 --> 00:18:00.042
Now. come on. hurry up.

242
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:10.250
Look. Saman!

243
00:19:10.333 --> 00:19:11.375
Yeah.

244
00:19:25.083 --> 00:19:26.708
Where are you two going this time?

245
00:19:26.792 --> 00:19:27.875
Jatipeni.

246
00:19:28.917 --> 00:19:31.583
I've taken your uncles. your cousins.
your brothers.

247
00:19:31.667 --> 00:19:34.125
None of them even tried to pay…

248
00:19:36.625 --> 00:19:38.500
-Hop in.
-Come on. Adi.

249
00:19:38.875 --> 00:19:41.125
God is Great!

250
00:19:41.208 --> 00:19:42.625
Adi?

251
00:19:43.333 --> 00:19:45.417
-What's wrong?
-We should pray first.

252
00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.958
Oh. please.
We'll be late. It's almost dusk.

253
00:19:49.042 --> 00:19:51.333
Let's skip the prayers for once.

254
00:19:51.417 --> 00:19:53.667
-We can't skip the prayers!
-Come on.

255
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:55.750
We'll pray at the Jatipeni Mosque.

256
00:19:55.833 --> 00:19:59.375
-All right?
-Shall we?

257
00:19:59.458 --> 00:20:00.667
Let's go.

258
00:20:03.833 --> 00:20:07.292
Oh! I'm screwed!
I left the honey near the restrooms!

259
00:20:08.417 --> 00:20:10.917
It's your fault. You're so careless.

260
00:20:38.125 --> 00:20:40.458
Saman. in my opinion.

261
00:20:41.375 --> 00:20:44.583
Miss Woro is so mean
because she is still single.

262
00:20:44.667 --> 00:20:46.958
That's what happens to old virgins.

263
00:20:47.042 --> 00:20:49.625
No one is taking care of them.
That's why they are always angry.

264
00:20:49.708 --> 00:20:52.625
Nah. she's just a mean person.

265
00:20:53.292 --> 00:20:55.750
She's mean and still unmarried.
The whole package.

266
00:21:36.583 --> 00:21:38.500
Have you ever thought of this?

267
00:21:38.583 --> 00:21:41.292
How free we would be without her?

268
00:21:41.375 --> 00:21:43.833
We could go fishing all we wanted.

269
00:21:43.917 --> 00:21:46.292
And if we were late.
nobody would yell at us. Right?

270
00:21:46.375 --> 00:21:47.958
That's right.

271
00:21:48.042 --> 00:21:50.375
Better yet. that damn teacher
shouldn't just leave.

272
00:21:50.458 --> 00:21:51.458
She should Just die.

273
00:21:51.542 --> 00:21:53.958
Watch your mouth. Saman!

274
00:21:55.083 --> 00:21:56.750
What's happening?

275
00:21:56.833 --> 00:21:58.083
Sir?

276
00:21:58.833 --> 00:22:00.500
Oh no.

277
00:22:05.917 --> 00:22:07.042
Dang it!

278
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:22.083
Just a second.

279
00:25:03.833 --> 00:25:06.458
-Is it fixed?
-I guess.

280
00:25:13.125 --> 00:25:15.125
Mr. Nyoto. Mr. Mantri.

281
00:25:15.208 --> 00:25:17.625
-Where are you headed?
-To Jatijajar.

282
00:25:17.708 --> 00:25:19.292
Miss Woro had an accident.

283
00:25:19.375 --> 00:25:20.750
I'll see you later.

284
00:25:20.833 --> 00:25:23.417
Adi. I think I need to turn back.

285
00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.875
Just in case they need a car
to drive to the hospital.

286
00:25:25.958 --> 00:25:27.583
Okay.

287
00:26:00.167 --> 00:26:04.167
Take it easy. be careful.

288
00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:10.625
-Ready? We do it together.
-Come on.

289
00:26:10.708 --> 00:26:12.583
Take it easy.

290
00:26:12.667 --> 00:26:15.208
Mr. Mantri. if you can help.

291
00:26:16.833 --> 00:26:18.083
Be careful. Careful.

292
00:26:19.292 --> 00:26:22.583
Hey. what are these kids
doing here so late?

293
00:26:22.667 --> 00:26:24.083
Go home.

294
00:26:24.167 --> 00:26:25.375
Go home. you shouldn't be here.

295
00:26:26.208 --> 00:26:27.208
Go.

296
00:26:27.292 --> 00:26:30.333
-Please help.
-Yes. sir.

297
00:26:30.417 --> 00:26:31.917
Go home.

298
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.083
Go home. boys.

299
00:26:39.792 --> 00:26:40.917
Saman.

300
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.625
What if Miss Woro died
because of what we said?

301
00:26:44.708 --> 00:26:45.875
Nonsense.

302
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.125
It was just her time to go.

303
00:26:50.708 --> 00:26:52.708
-Where are you going?
-Home.

304
00:26:53.792 --> 00:26:55.417
We didn't get to watch the wayang show.

305
00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:57.792
I'd rather sleep.
It beats watching dead people.

306
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.125
I seek refuge in Allah
from the outcast Shaitan.

307
00:27:15.208 --> 00:27:18.625
In the name of Allah
the Most Gracious and the Most Merciful.

308
00:27:19.292 --> 00:27:21.750
Ya-seen.

309
00:27:21.833 --> 00:27:25.000
By the wise Qur'an.

310
00:27:25.083 --> 00:27:28.417
Indeed you are from among the messengers.

311
00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:32.083
On a straight path.

312
00:27:32.167 --> 00:27:35.542
This is a revelation
of the Exalted in Might. the Merciful.

313
00:27:35.625 --> 00:27:41.333
You may warn a people whose forefathers
were not warned. so they are unaware.

314
00:27:41.417 --> 00:27:46.750
Already the word has come into effect
upon most of them. so they do not believe.

315
00:27:46.833 --> 00:27:51.042
Indeed. we have put shackles
on their necks.

316
00:27:51.125 --> 00:27:54.833
and they are to their chins.
so they are with heads kept aloft.

317
00:27:54.917 --> 00:28:00.542
And We have put before them
a barrier and behind them a barrier…

318
00:28:54.417 --> 00:28:58.500
There's a prayer service for tonight.

319
00:28:59.208 --> 00:29:01.833
-Her seventh day?
-That's right.

320
00:29:36.708 --> 00:29:37.833
Saman.

321
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:40.875
I haven't seen you since the gathering.

322
00:29:46.042 --> 00:29:47.375
I don't feel well.

323
00:29:51.708 --> 00:29:52.875
By the way.

324
00:29:52.958 --> 00:29:55.750
They said that tomorrow.
Miss Woro's replacement will arrive.

325
00:29:55.833 --> 00:29:58.125
I heard she's young and pretty.

326
00:29:58.208 --> 00:30:00.917
Maybe you will feel better
when you see her. Saman.

327
00:30:04.417 --> 00:30:05.458
We'll see.

328
00:30:20.667 --> 00:30:21.833
Honestly speaking.

329
00:30:23.708 --> 00:30:27.667
I still think about
what we said about Miss Woro that night.

330
00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:44.458
All right then. I'm going home.

331
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.042
I'll leave the fish here.

332
00:30:51.083 --> 00:30:52.125
Thank you. Adi.

333
00:30:56.792 --> 00:30:57.917
Peace be upon you.

334
00:32:14.333 --> 00:32:15.583
Granny?

335
00:32:20.708 --> 00:32:21.708
Who is it. Granny?

336
00:32:32.458 --> 00:32:33.458
Is it a ghost?

337
00:34:36.667 --> 00:34:37.792
Ayu?

338
00:34:40.083 --> 00:34:41.375
Come with me.

339
00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.500
With the Village Chief.

340
00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.167
To meet the new teacher.

341
00:34:48.292 --> 00:34:49.417
The new teacher?

342
00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:53.250
Yes. Miss Woro's replacement.

343
00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:56.708
Why is she arriving so late?

344
00:34:56.792 --> 00:34:58.500
I don't know.

345
00:34:58.583 --> 00:35:01.583
Maybe it's the only transport
she could get.

346
00:35:01.667 --> 00:35:02.917
Come on.

347
00:35:13.875 --> 00:35:15.917
-Is this the last car?
-Yes. it is.

348
00:35:16.875 --> 00:35:18.417
She should be here.

349
00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:21.500
-Evening. sir.
-Hello.

350
00:35:24.542 --> 00:35:26.333
-Is it her?
-Maybe.

351
00:35:27.292 --> 00:35:30.208
I'm sorry. are you Miss Ningsih?

352
00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:32.375
Yes. that's right.

353
00:35:33.792 --> 00:35:36.583
Oh. thank God.

354
00:35:36.667 --> 00:35:38.875
My name is Dul Rohim.

355
00:35:39.375 --> 00:35:42.000
I am the head of the village
here in Jatijajar.

356
00:35:42.083 --> 00:35:43.667
-I see.
-Let me introduce you.

357
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:47.042
This is my wife.

358
00:35:47.958 --> 00:35:50.958
Welcome to Jatijajar. Miss Ningsih.

359
00:35:51.042 --> 00:35:52.250
Thank you. ma'am.

360
00:35:53.125 --> 00:35:55.375
This is our security. Amin.

361
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.042
Miss.

362
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:59.042
Mr. Marto.

363
00:35:59.375 --> 00:36:00.583
Welcome.

364
00:36:01.917 --> 00:36:06.042
We were so worried.
We've been waiting for you.

365
00:36:06.125 --> 00:36:07.875
I'm sorry about that.

366
00:36:07.958 --> 00:36:11.958
I got lost and ended up in another
village. but I'm here now.

367
00:36:12.042 --> 00:36:13.958
-Yes.
-Very well.

368
00:36:14.042 --> 00:36:16.292
And who is this?

369
00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:19.750
Her name is Ayu.

370
00:36:19.833 --> 00:36:21.625
I'm sorry. miss.

371
00:36:21.708 --> 00:36:24.792
She is one of your students in your class.

372
00:36:26.208 --> 00:36:27.458
Hello. Ayu.

373
00:36:28.875 --> 00:36:30.708
You can call me Miss Ningsih.

374
00:36:30.792 --> 00:36:32.500
I'll see you at school.

375
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.250
Miss.

376
00:36:46.333 --> 00:36:48.208
I'm sorry I'm late. I was…

377
00:36:48.292 --> 00:36:51.208
Good morning. You must be Adi.

378
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000
Come in. We're just about to start.

379
00:36:57.292 --> 00:36:58.375
Come on in.

380
00:37:06.042 --> 00:37:09.625
Since this is my first day teaching.

381
00:37:10.542 --> 00:37:15.417
I am not sure how far you are
with your lessons.

382
00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:17.000
Miss.

383
00:37:17.083 --> 00:37:19.458
We were doing the exercises
in our workbook.

384
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:26.042
All right. Then for today.
you can continue the workbook exercises.

385
00:37:26.125 --> 00:37:28.792
But. miss. I've finished them all.

386
00:37:28.875 --> 00:37:31.958
But your friends haven't. Ayu.

387
00:37:32.667 --> 00:37:36.167
While the others do their work.

388
00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:40.792
you can check again
if your answers are right.

389
00:37:41.708 --> 00:37:42.750
Okay?

390
00:37:45.083 --> 00:37:46.375
Good luck.

391
00:38:05.125 --> 00:38:07.375
-Thanks. sir.
-Hey!

392
00:38:10.708 --> 00:38:12.000
Thank you.

393
00:38:15.458 --> 00:38:16.583
Sir.

394
00:38:19.208 --> 00:38:21.500
-Oh. it's you.
-Yes.

395
00:38:21.583 --> 00:38:22.958
-You just got home?
-Yes.

396
00:38:23.958 --> 00:38:26.833
I'm here to pick up the money
from the honey sales.

397
00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:29.833
What money?

398
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.750
I have not received any honey till today.

399
00:38:36.417 --> 00:38:39.417
Did Saman not deliver
the bottles to you. sir?

400
00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:47.917
Just go and ask your little brother
if you don't believe me.

401
00:38:52.292 --> 00:38:53.750
That little shit.

402
00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:58.333
All right. excuse me. sir.

403
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:19.208
Salman? Salman!

404
00:39:20.667 --> 00:39:23.292
You little… Come here. you.

405
00:39:23.375 --> 00:39:24.833
Come here!

406
00:39:33.875 --> 00:39:35.375
What did I tell you?

407
00:39:35.458 --> 00:39:39.125
We have no money. and you can't even
be bothered to deliver honey?

408
00:39:42.333 --> 00:39:43.625
What do you want?

409
00:39:44.833 --> 00:39:46.292
What do you want? Answer me!

410
00:39:56.417 --> 00:39:57.875
I want you dead.

411
00:40:00.708 --> 00:40:01.833
What did you just say?

412
00:40:04.625 --> 00:40:06.917
What did you just say? Tell me.

413
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.167
What did you say to me?

414
00:40:10.583 --> 00:40:12.875
No… No.

415
00:40:14.875 --> 00:40:16.333
No. no. Please.

416
00:40:16.833 --> 00:40:18.958
Please. don't!

417
00:40:19.583 --> 00:40:20.708
No!

418
00:40:22.958 --> 00:40:26.167
Help. please!

419
00:40:27.208 --> 00:40:28.708
Help!

420
00:42:36.292 --> 00:42:37.333
What are you doing. Saman?

421
00:42:44.792 --> 00:42:45.792
Saman?

422
00:42:51.167 --> 00:42:52.208
Saman?

423
00:43:03.292 --> 00:43:04.292
Saman.

424
00:43:15.292 --> 00:43:16.458
What is this?

425
00:43:23.833 --> 00:43:25.542
Oh God!

426
00:43:25.917 --> 00:43:27.000
What is this. Saman?

427
00:43:27.708 --> 00:43:30.667
Saman. where are you going? Saman!

428
00:43:46.125 --> 00:43:47.417
Oh. dear God.

429
00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:51.208
Honey!

430
00:43:53.042 --> 00:43:55.333
Our chickens are all dead.

431
00:43:56.292 --> 00:43:58.875
Somebody killed them all.

432
00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:21.000
Ayu. let's go to class.

433
00:44:31.625 --> 00:44:37.000
Students. you can do the exercises
in this new workbook.

434
00:44:37.083 --> 00:44:40.000
Once you're done.
you can put them on my desk.

435
00:44:40.083 --> 00:44:41.500
I need to go to the teacher's room.

436
00:44:42.333 --> 00:44:44.917
Yes. miss.

437
00:45:34.167 --> 00:45:36.833
Saman…

438
00:45:45.083 --> 00:45:47.625
Saman.

439
00:45:52.292 --> 00:45:54.583
Saman.

440
00:46:05.292 --> 00:46:08.833
It happened here. sir.

441
00:46:09.458 --> 00:46:11.167
-Here?
-Right here.

442
00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:12.708
And this is blood.

443
00:46:12.792 --> 00:46:14.250
You can see for yourself.

444
00:46:14.333 --> 00:46:15.583
I'll go first. sir.

445
00:46:24.792 --> 00:46:26.708
I think he's mad at me.

446
00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:30.208
But even so. this is too much.
don't you think?

447
00:46:31.708 --> 00:46:33.792
-This is obvious.
-It is. sir.

448
00:46:34.542 --> 00:46:37.875
My chickens are dead
and the blood is here.

449
00:46:38.292 --> 00:46:41.833
You mean that Saman did this?

450
00:46:41.917 --> 00:46:43.250
The proof is all here.

451
00:46:43.333 --> 00:46:46.875
Shouldn't we go over to his house
to check on him?

452
00:46:46.958 --> 00:46:49.250
-All right.
-Let's do it now.

453
00:46:49.333 --> 00:46:51.917
-After you.
-All right.

454
00:46:55.792 --> 00:46:57.500
Ayu. stay at home.

455
00:47:03.875 --> 00:47:05.000
Stop. stop.

456
00:47:06.792 --> 00:47:07.917
Thanks for the ride.

457
00:47:08.708 --> 00:47:11.208
-Ayu. I'm here to buy fish bait.
-Adi. Adi. Adi.

458
00:47:12.292 --> 00:47:14.375
Adi. come with me.

459
00:47:14.458 --> 00:47:15.792
Come with me now. quick.

460
00:47:15.875 --> 00:47:17.208
-What is it. Ayu?
-Come on!

461
00:47:17.292 --> 00:47:18.292
Where?

462
00:47:18.375 --> 00:47:19.917
Saman! Saman!

463
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.208
Samiun?

464
00:47:25.375 --> 00:47:26.417
Saman.

465
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.250
Samiun?

466
00:47:31.292 --> 00:47:32.708
-It's unlocked.
-Open it.

467
00:47:33.875 --> 00:47:35.500
Samiun? Granny?

468
00:47:47.125 --> 00:47:48.833
We need to lift him.

469
00:47:48.917 --> 00:47:52.625
-What happened here?
-Help me lift him.

470
00:47:53.708 --> 00:47:54.708
Come on.

471
00:47:57.292 --> 00:47:58.292
Oh. dear.

472
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.417
Just ask for help.

473
00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:05.708
Help! Help! Help.

474
00:48:05.792 --> 00:48:07.667
-Help!
-Adi! Adi!

475
00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:15.125
Sir. please come with me. quick.

476
00:48:16.292 --> 00:48:18.667
-The village chief is inside. Help.
-Quickly.

477
00:48:31.167 --> 00:48:32.208
Saman!

478
00:48:33.708 --> 00:48:35.042
-Adi!
-What's wrong. Ayu?

479
00:48:35.125 --> 00:48:36.208
Saman!

480
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.083
Gosh.

481
00:48:40.208 --> 00:48:43.208
Look! There he is!

482
00:48:44.333 --> 00:48:45.417
Saman?

483
00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:47.500
It's Samiun.

484
00:48:48.833 --> 00:48:50.167
Samiun is…

485
00:48:54.292 --> 00:48:55.458
Saman?

486
00:48:59.458 --> 00:49:00.500
Saman?

487
00:49:13.792 --> 00:49:14.917
Saman!

488
00:49:17.292 --> 00:49:18.500
What's wrong. Saman?

489
00:49:20.208 --> 00:49:23.542
Saman. are you okay?

490
00:49:23.625 --> 00:49:24.833
Saman!

491
00:49:25.458 --> 00:49:28.292
Do you hear him humming?

492
00:49:28.792 --> 00:49:31.917
It's all right. We'll deal with it later.

493
00:49:38.875 --> 00:49:40.417
How is Saman holding up. sir?

494
00:49:42.042 --> 00:49:44.750
Saman hasn't said a word
since we found him. miss.

495
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:48.125
He just keeps humming.

496
00:49:48.917 --> 00:49:51.625
I think his soul is vexed.

497
00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:55.542
We've contacted the police.

498
00:49:55.625 --> 00:49:57.333
They are on their way.

499
00:49:57.417 --> 00:50:00.583
They will take him to the district.

500
00:50:01.333 --> 00:50:04.833
Sir. if I may. please give me
some time to talk to Saman.

501
00:50:04.917 --> 00:50:07.333
I feel like I can still make him talk.

502
00:50:07.417 --> 00:50:09.875
We've tried everything.

503
00:50:10.625 --> 00:50:12.167
He still wouldn't talk. miss.

504
00:50:13.125 --> 00:50:15.667
But if you would like to try.

505
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:18.083
be my guest.

506
00:50:18.167 --> 00:50:20.458
-Please be careful. though.
-All right. sir.

507
00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:22.500
This way.

508
00:50:23.167 --> 00:50:24.250
Be careful. miss.

509
00:50:33.833 --> 00:50:36.000
-Amin?
-Yes. sir?

510
00:51:10.167 --> 00:51:12.625
Adi. Adi.

511
00:51:12.708 --> 00:51:15.000
-Careful.
-Let it go.

512
00:51:15.083 --> 00:51:17.042
-Remember Samiun.
-Just a second.

513
00:51:28.208 --> 00:51:29.333
How did it go?

514
00:51:31.208 --> 00:51:32.542
I tried.

515
00:51:32.625 --> 00:51:36.667
I tried to talk to him.
but he wouldn't answer me.

516
00:51:42.167 --> 00:51:45.333
God is Great!

517
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:50.583
God is Great!

518
00:52:48.375 --> 00:52:50.000
Leave!

519
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.208
-They're here. sir.
-Right.

520
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.625
-Thank you.
-Yes.

521
00:53:07.625 --> 00:53:09.917
-Sorry for the trouble. This way.
-All right.

522
00:53:11.042 --> 00:53:12.792
He's just a kid. sir.

523
00:53:12.875 --> 00:53:14.500
-Just a kid.
-Over there?

524
00:53:17.625 --> 00:53:18.708
Oh. God!

525
00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:27.083
God forgive me.

526
00:53:33.625 --> 00:53:36.125
Sir. Let's get him down.

527
00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:42.917
I can only imagine
what you're going through.

528
00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:46.083
My deepest condolences.

529
00:55:49.292 --> 00:55:52.083
But as far as I know.

530
00:55:52.167 --> 00:55:56.000
talking about what we are feeling

531
00:55:56.083 --> 00:55:59.042
can help us face our sadness.

532
00:56:01.167 --> 00:56:03.000
So.

533
00:56:03.083 --> 00:56:07.667
if you do need a friend to talk to

534
00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:10.208
about anything.

535
00:56:11.583 --> 00:56:15.042
I will gladly listen.

536
00:56:20.167 --> 00:56:22.625
All right. sweet boy?

537
00:56:25.792 --> 00:56:26.833
Yes. miss.

538
00:56:27.792 --> 00:56:29.667
One more thing.

539
00:56:30.958 --> 00:56:33.250
Exams are coming up.

540
00:56:34.167 --> 00:56:38.500
Your scores are still very low.

541
00:56:39.625 --> 00:56:44.333
How about we start
the extra lessons today?

542
00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:54.625
Or do you need more time?

543
00:56:56.292 --> 00:56:58.792
It's okay. Today is fine.

544
00:57:07.083 --> 00:57:10.875
You can keep the keys with you. miss.

545
00:57:10.958 --> 00:57:13.417
-Yes. sir.
-I should go home.

546
00:57:14.917 --> 00:57:16.625
It's almost dusk.

547
00:57:21.375 --> 00:57:22.792
Don't worry. sir.

548
00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:25.500
I will walk Adi back home.

549
00:57:26.208 --> 00:57:28.708
He said he wants to pray here.

550
00:57:28.792 --> 00:57:32.042
Oh. well then. take care.

551
00:57:32.125 --> 00:57:33.333
Yes.

552
00:57:33.417 --> 00:57:37.208
Please be careful on your way home. miss.

553
00:57:37.292 --> 00:57:40.833
The situation hasn't been good lately.

554
00:57:40.917 --> 00:57:41.958
I will.

555
00:57:42.042 --> 00:57:43.792
-Excuse me.
-Thank you.

556
00:57:46.208 --> 00:57:49.542
Adi. I am going to pray at home.

557
00:57:50.208 --> 00:57:52.750
-What about you?
-I'll pray here. miss.

558
00:57:53.792 --> 00:57:55.542
All right. I'll be right back.

559
00:57:55.625 --> 00:57:56.625
Okay.

560
00:58:05.917 --> 00:58:07.292
God is Great.

561
00:58:10.417 --> 00:58:12.292
God is Great.

562
00:58:13.708 --> 00:58:15.167
God is Great.

563
00:58:18.083 --> 00:58:20.500
God is Great.

564
00:58:22.708 --> 00:58:24.042
In the name of Allah.
the Beneficent. the Merciful.

565
00:58:24.125 --> 00:58:25.333
Praise be to Allah.
the Lord of the Worlds.

566
00:58:25.417 --> 00:58:27.583
The Beneficent. the Merciful.
Master of the Day of Judgment.

567
00:58:27.667 --> 00:58:29.542
Thee do we serve
and Thee do we beseech for help.

568
00:58:29.625 --> 00:58:31.458
Keep us on the right path.

569
00:58:31.917 --> 00:58:35.000
The path of those upon whom
Thou hast bestowed favors.

570
00:58:36.917 --> 00:58:39.542
Not (the path) of those upon whom
Thy wrath is brought unto.

571
00:58:39.625 --> 00:58:41.125
nor of those who go astray.

572
00:58:43.375 --> 00:58:46.375
Amen.

573
00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:12.625
Miss?

574
00:59:16.292 --> 00:59:17.458
Miss Ningsih?

575
00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:22.667
Miss?

576
01:00:11.667 --> 01:00:13.000
Help.

577
01:00:13.917 --> 01:00:16.292
Help.

578
01:00:16.375 --> 01:00:18.000
Help me.

579
01:00:18.083 --> 01:00:19.583
Help.

580
01:00:20.458 --> 01:00:25.208
Help. Help.

581
01:00:34.375 --> 01:00:36.875
Oh. Adi.

582
01:00:38.292 --> 01:00:39.458
You're awake?

583
01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:46.208
Adi.

584
01:00:48.917 --> 01:00:49.958
Adi.

585
01:00:52.292 --> 01:00:53.333
Son.

586
01:00:55.542 --> 01:00:56.667
What's wrong?

587
01:00:58.625 --> 01:00:59.625
Son.

588
01:01:01.083 --> 01:01:02.167
Adi.

589
01:01:04.625 --> 01:01:05.667
Adi.

590
01:01:08.125 --> 01:01:09.125
Adi.

591
01:01:10.792 --> 01:01:11.833
Hey.

592
01:01:13.375 --> 01:01:14.583
What is wrong with you?

593
01:01:15.292 --> 01:01:16.458
I'm sorry. Dad.

594
01:01:17.333 --> 01:01:19.042
I'm still sleepy.

595
01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:26.042
All right. Wash your face
and then do your prayers. okay?

596
01:01:47.417 --> 01:01:50.125
Hey. What are you doing here?

597
01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:53.250
What?

598
01:01:55.583 --> 01:01:56.708
Crazy.

599
01:02:02.250 --> 01:02:04.625
Thank you. kids. See you tomorrow.

600
01:02:05.375 --> 01:02:07.083
Thank you. sir.

601
01:02:45.042 --> 01:02:46.292
Adi.

602
01:02:46.917 --> 01:02:48.125
Are you okay?

603
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:18.958
Adi?

604
01:04:29.292 --> 01:04:31.792
Adi? Adi!

605
01:05:02.417 --> 01:05:06.000
Let's play!

606
01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:09.792
Let's play!

607
01:05:10.292 --> 01:05:13.875
Let's play!

608
01:05:13.958 --> 01:05:17.792
Let's play!

609
01:05:17.875 --> 01:05:21.417
Let's play!

610
01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:24.917
Let's play!

611
01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:28.917
Let's play!

612
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.792
Let's play!

613
01:05:32.875 --> 01:05:35.708
Bondan?

614
01:05:38.125 --> 01:05:40.792
Bondan? Bondan?

615
01:05:42.625 --> 01:05:43.708
Bondan?

616
01:05:45.083 --> 01:05:47.417
Bondan! Bondan!

617
01:05:48.292 --> 01:05:49.667
Bondan!

618
01:05:55.208 --> 01:05:56.500
Adi!

619
01:05:58.375 --> 01:06:00.542
-Bondan!
-Adi!

620
01:06:00.625 --> 01:06:02.708
-Bondan!
-Bondan!

621
01:06:04.792 --> 01:06:06.000
Be strong. ma'am.

622
01:06:07.167 --> 01:06:08.792
We'll find Bondan soon.

623
01:06:08.875 --> 01:06:11.125
-We'll look for him together.
-Please. find my son.

624
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.208
Be strong.

625
01:06:15.875 --> 01:06:18.833
-Adi?
-Bondan!

626
01:06:18.917 --> 01:06:20.208
Bondan!

627
01:06:21.292 --> 01:06:23.125
-Bondan!
-Bondan!

628
01:06:23.708 --> 01:06:24.917
Bondan!

629
01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:35.292
Before you do the exercises
in the new book.

630
01:06:35.375 --> 01:06:36.708
I want to remind you.

631
01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:40.875
After school. please go straight home.

632
01:06:40.958 --> 01:06:42.208
Don't go anywhere else.

633
01:06:43.292 --> 01:06:47.458
And once you reach home. please pray

634
01:06:47.542 --> 01:06:50.875
so that Bondan and Adi will be found soon.

635
01:06:51.958 --> 01:06:53.333
Understood?

636
01:06:53.417 --> 01:06:55.417
Yes. miss.

637
01:06:55.500 --> 01:07:01.208
All right. You can do the exercises
on pages 3 to 10.

638
01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:34.250
Good afternoon. ma'am.

639
01:07:39.333 --> 01:07:40.500
What's wrong. Ayu?

640
01:07:41.083 --> 01:07:42.667
Did you get something yesterday?

641
01:07:44.125 --> 01:07:45.208
Something?

642
01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:47.667
What do you mean?

643
01:07:54.542 --> 01:07:56.708
-What is that. Ayu?
-It's an amulet.

644
01:07:58.250 --> 01:08:00.208
To protect you.

645
01:08:08.708 --> 01:08:11.167
Protect me from what. Ayu?

646
01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:14.250
From evil spirits.

647
01:08:15.292 --> 01:08:16.958
The ones that hurt Saman.

648
01:08:18.750 --> 01:08:20.250
Where did you get this?

649
01:08:25.125 --> 01:08:29.208
You didn't have to.

650
01:08:30.292 --> 01:08:32.833
But thank you. I appreciate it.

651
01:08:33.958 --> 01:08:36.500
Now. go home.

652
01:08:36.583 --> 01:08:37.792
Don't go wandering off.

653
01:09:21.792 --> 01:09:25.458
-Ayu. where are you going?
-To go pray.

654
01:09:25.542 --> 01:09:29.125
Wait a second. Things are bad. dear.

655
01:09:29.208 --> 01:09:33.417
We still haven't found Bondan and Adi.
It's almost dusk.

656
01:09:33.833 --> 01:09:37.958
It's okay. Dad. I want to pray so that
we can find Adi and Bondan soon.

657
01:09:38.042 --> 01:09:40.375
-Peace be upon you.
-And also upon you.

658
01:09:40.458 --> 01:09:42.417
Come home after you pray. okay?

659
01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:43.750
Yes.

660
01:09:58.917 --> 01:10:00.500
It's so quiet here.

661
01:10:00.583 --> 01:10:04.417
Yes. I don't think anyone else is coming.

662
01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:08.875
This is a test.

663
01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:13.833
At times like this.

664
01:10:14.708 --> 01:10:17.208
we should be even closer to God.

665
01:10:18.292 --> 01:10:20.458
-All right. You should get ready.
-Yes.

666
01:11:05.792 --> 01:11:06.917
Adi?

667
01:11:11.708 --> 01:11:12.792
Adi?

668
01:11:36.792 --> 01:11:39.833
Oh God. Adi! What happened to you?

669
01:11:40.833 --> 01:11:41.875
Sir!

670
01:11:42.667 --> 01:11:44.167
Sir?

671
01:11:44.250 --> 01:11:45.667
-Sir?
-What's wrong?

672
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:47.708
There's a dead body. sir!

673
01:11:48.833 --> 01:11:50.375
Oh. God.

674
01:11:51.417 --> 01:11:52.417
Let's help him.

675
01:11:57.292 --> 01:11:58.375
Adi?

676
01:12:12.667 --> 01:12:13.792
Help!

677
01:12:16.583 --> 01:12:19.042
Help! Help!

678
01:12:19.833 --> 01:12:21.875
Help!

679
01:12:24.917 --> 01:12:27.917
Oh. God. Ayu!

680
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.625
-Help!
-Ayu!

681
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.292
Ayu! Come here!

682
01:12:54.792 --> 01:12:58.125
I haven't locked the back door!

683
01:12:58.208 --> 01:12:59.792
Ma'am!

684
01:13:04.083 --> 01:13:05.625
Ma'am. no!

685
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.125
No. Adi.

686
01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.167
Adi.

687
01:13:16.083 --> 01:13:17.083
Adi.

688
01:13:22.083 --> 01:13:23.250
Please don't.

689
01:14:43.792 --> 01:14:45.500
Hold him down.

690
01:14:46.042 --> 01:14:49.917
God forgive me.

691
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Adi.

692
01:14:51.583 --> 01:14:53.375
-Adi!
-Oh God!

693
01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:56.125
Remember God. son.

694
01:15:03.875 --> 01:15:06.542
Remember God. Adi.

695
01:15:06.625 --> 01:15:09.083
Oh God.

696
01:15:09.958 --> 01:15:12.292
God forgive me.

697
01:15:13.083 --> 01:15:17.708
-Remember God. son.
-God forgive us.

698
01:15:18.417 --> 01:15:21.000
-Adi.
-Oh. God.

699
01:15:24.583 --> 01:15:25.750
God forgive me.

700
01:15:25.833 --> 01:15:28.417
Adi. Adi.

701
01:15:29.708 --> 01:15:30.917
God forgive me.

702
01:15:33.625 --> 01:15:35.917
Remember God. Adi.

703
01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:39.417
Oh God. Adi.

704
01:15:40.667 --> 01:15:42.958
-Dad.
-Adi.

705
01:15:45.333 --> 01:15:46.667
Oh. thank God.

706
01:16:05.583 --> 01:16:07.208
I gave it to them.

707
01:16:07.292 --> 01:16:09.708
-Yes.
-Here he is.

708
01:16:10.417 --> 01:16:11.500
Mr. Kasan.

709
01:16:12.292 --> 01:16:14.292
Something must have possessed Adi.

710
01:16:14.375 --> 01:16:15.375
That's right.

711
01:16:17.125 --> 01:16:18.375
Earlier.

712
01:16:19.542 --> 01:16:21.625
when Bondan regained consciousness.

713
01:16:22.583 --> 01:16:24.708
I asked him.

714
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.625
It turns out that Bondan

715
01:16:28.708 --> 01:16:31.792
was taken to Saman's grave by Adi.

716
01:16:34.875 --> 01:16:41.792
Adi dug up the grave and then
placed Saman's body at Mr. Marto's house.

717
01:16:41.875 --> 01:16:44.333
Oh. God. Adi.

718
01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:48.000
I don't know why.

719
01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.417
-Amin?
-Mr. Amin?

720
01:16:57.583 --> 01:17:02.000
That's why I am certain
something is violating Adi.

721
01:17:02.083 --> 01:17:04.458
Something is messing with this village.

722
01:17:05.292 --> 01:17:06.500
I remember.

723
01:17:06.583 --> 01:17:07.667
This.

724
01:17:08.875 --> 01:17:09.875
This thing.

725
01:17:09.958 --> 01:17:13.208
At dawn yesterday. I caught Karta.

726
01:17:13.292 --> 01:17:14.458
Right here.

727
01:17:14.833 --> 01:17:17.917
I'm sure Karta placed it here.

728
01:17:21.875 --> 01:17:26.583
I also saw an amulet like this
at Saman's house. sir.

729
01:17:27.417 --> 01:17:29.750
When we found Samiun.

730
01:17:31.333 --> 01:17:33.958
Then it's obvious. Karta did it.

731
01:17:34.042 --> 01:17:38.958
Remember? Before he hung himself.
Saman seemed possessed.

732
01:17:39.042 --> 01:17:41.792
-That's right.
-Wait. Please don't jump to conclusions.

733
01:17:41.875 --> 01:17:44.625
We need to be careful.
We don't have solid evidence…

734
01:17:44.708 --> 01:17:49.250
Mr. Amin and Mr. Marto's statements
are clear evidence.

735
01:17:50.167 --> 01:17:52.542
The amulet is right here.

736
01:17:52.625 --> 01:17:54.208
Now let's hurry up.

737
01:17:54.292 --> 01:17:57.042
We should find Karta and make him confess.

738
01:17:57.125 --> 01:17:59.042
-Let's all go there.
-Sir.

739
01:17:59.125 --> 01:18:01.000
This is the work of an infidel.

740
01:18:01.083 --> 01:18:02.208
-I agree.
-An infidel. I say.

741
01:18:02.292 --> 01:18:03.875
Let's go to Karta's place and ask him.

742
01:18:03.958 --> 01:18:06.417
-Wait!
-Let's go.

743
01:18:08.417 --> 01:18:14.417
Get rid of all the diseases.

744
01:18:15.125 --> 01:18:20.125
Keep the jinn and devil away.

745
01:18:21.583 --> 01:18:23.250
-Karta. come out.
-Karta.

746
01:18:23.333 --> 01:18:24.625
-What do you want?
-Karta.

747
01:18:24.708 --> 01:18:27.000
-What do you want?
-Come on!

748
01:18:27.375 --> 01:18:29.125
-Come on!
-Hold him tight.

749
01:18:30.167 --> 01:18:32.167
-Come on!
-Grab his hands.

750
01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:33.792
Come on.

751
01:18:35.417 --> 01:18:37.250
-What did I do wrong?
-What?

752
01:18:37.333 --> 01:18:39.833
What did you do wrong?!
Here. What is this?

753
01:18:41.167 --> 01:18:42.917
You placed this. didn't you?

754
01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.125
My child is possessed because of you.

755
01:18:47.417 --> 01:18:50.208
You're all under a spell. idiots!

756
01:18:50.292 --> 01:18:52.333
-Idiots.
-You infidel!

757
01:18:52.417 --> 01:18:56.417
-Calm down. Mr. Kasan! Calm down!
-Just kill him!

758
01:18:57.500 --> 01:19:01.042
-Kill him!
-No. please don't!

759
01:19:01.125 --> 01:19:05.583
Please don't!

760
01:19:07.167 --> 01:19:10.292
That is enough!

761
01:19:10.375 --> 01:19:12.208
This village already has enough problems.

762
01:19:12.292 --> 01:19:14.167
Let's not add more to it.

763
01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:16.125
Let's just take him to my place.

764
01:19:16.875 --> 01:19:18.042
Let's go.

765
01:19:24.792 --> 01:19:27.083
Your fever's going down. dear.

766
01:19:27.542 --> 01:19:29.208
You'll go back to school tomorrow. okay?

767
01:19:32.208 --> 01:19:33.292
Dad.

768
01:19:35.292 --> 01:19:38.917
I'm sure that Uncle Karta didn't do it.

769
01:19:39.875 --> 01:19:41.708
He would never do it.

770
01:19:44.792 --> 01:19:50.917
Let's just leave it to the village chief
and the authorities.

771
01:19:52.958 --> 01:19:54.292
I've made peace with it…

772
01:19:56.417 --> 01:19:58.292
if Karta did do it.

773
01:20:08.375 --> 01:20:09.917
Ayu.

774
01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.625
Oh. a guest for Ayu.
Do come in. This way. miss.

775
01:20:13.708 --> 01:20:16.792
Ayu. you have a visitor.

776
01:20:17.125 --> 01:20:18.333
Hello. Ayu.

777
01:20:19.583 --> 01:20:24.125
I'm sorry. I need to sort out my shop.

778
01:20:24.208 --> 01:20:26.583
-It's okay.
-Make yourself at home.

779
01:20:26.667 --> 01:20:28.417
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

780
01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:48.917
I heard what happened to you
last night. Ayu.

781
01:20:53.417 --> 01:20:55.000
Are you all right?

782
01:20:58.167 --> 01:21:00.500
I just have a bit of a headache now. miss.

783
01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:03.125
But thank God I'm better.

784
01:21:04.292 --> 01:21:05.917
Good.

785
01:21:07.083 --> 01:21:08.792
I'm glad to hear it.

786
01:21:12.792 --> 01:21:16.125
Last night. I paid a visit
to Karta's place.

787
01:21:19.125 --> 01:21:20.625
You visit him often. don't you?

788
01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.917
Animals come. animals die.

789
01:21:33.083 --> 01:21:36.000
People come. people die.

790
01:21:37.333 --> 01:21:40.917
Devils come. devils die.

791
01:21:43.208 --> 01:21:46.708
Giants come. giants die.

792
01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:51.000
Loyalty to the death.

793
01:21:52.208 --> 01:21:57.667
As is God's will.

794
01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:03.625
Ayu.

795
01:22:04.208 --> 01:22:07.000
Give this amulet to your new teacher.

796
01:22:09.625 --> 01:22:10.750
She's…

797
01:22:12.958 --> 01:22:14.125
Like…

798
01:22:14.708 --> 01:22:16.833
-She's like what?
-She seems…

799
01:22:18.125 --> 01:22:21.167
-Uncle? Uncle?
-The sky…

800
01:22:21.250 --> 01:22:23.792
The red sky is a sign.

801
01:22:24.375 --> 01:22:26.333
-Uncle.
-The air.

802
01:22:26.417 --> 01:22:28.000
It feels exactly the same

803
01:22:28.917 --> 01:22:33.042
as what I felt thirty years ago.

804
01:22:36.708 --> 01:22:39.750
And if my guess is correct.

805
01:22:42.292 --> 01:22:44.083
she is a jinn.

806
01:22:46.292 --> 01:22:48.583
The Black Mother.

807
01:22:48.667 --> 01:22:50.792
It's inside her.

808
01:22:52.083 --> 01:22:53.708
She is a jinn

809
01:22:54.792 --> 01:22:56.792
who feasts on children.

810
01:22:58.792 --> 01:23:00.542
Give it. Give it.

811
01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:03.125
Give this amulet to your new teacher.

812
01:23:04.292 --> 01:23:05.583
If she reacts.

813
01:23:07.375 --> 01:23:08.375
be careful.

814
01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:13.000
I will try to find a way
to make her leave this village.

815
01:23:17.792 --> 01:23:21.542
She must have a reason to come back.

816
01:23:42.208 --> 01:23:45.292
What did your uncle say about me?

817
01:23:47.833 --> 01:23:49.083
Did he tell you a lot?

818
01:24:03.917 --> 01:24:05.792
Do you want to know something. Ayu?

819
01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:14.792
I remember Karta.

820
01:24:16.583 --> 01:24:18.625
I remember him well.

821
01:24:20.417 --> 01:24:22.625
His face as a boy.

822
01:24:26.667 --> 01:24:29.458
He looked like you. Ayu.

823
01:25:02.292 --> 01:25:05.292
Don't believe in superstitions.

824
01:25:08.292 --> 01:25:11.042
You will end up in harm's way.

825
01:25:35.583 --> 01:25:38.500
So. you were her favorite student.
were you?

826
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.500
You're lucky.

827
01:25:54.917 --> 01:25:56.250
But…

828
01:25:57.500 --> 01:26:00.250
if I may remind you.

829
01:26:03.708 --> 01:26:09.042
stay out of this.

830
01:26:12.458 --> 01:26:15.292
You'll get your turn. Ayu.

831
01:26:17.542 --> 01:26:20.833
Just like your friends.

832
01:26:24.083 --> 01:26:30.917
You're better off dead.

833
01:26:36.833 --> 01:26:40.250
Seek forgiveness in God. son.

834
01:26:40.333 --> 01:26:41.750
Son!

835
01:26:49.708 --> 01:26:51.125
Have patience.

836
01:27:28.792 --> 01:27:30.250
Karta!

837
01:27:30.333 --> 01:27:32.250
-Wati!
-Drajat?

838
01:27:32.333 --> 01:27:33.792
-Karta!
-Drajat!

839
01:27:33.875 --> 01:27:35.125
Wati!

840
01:27:35.208 --> 01:27:36.375
Drajat!

841
01:27:36.458 --> 01:27:37.792
Karta!

842
01:27:41.792 --> 01:27:43.042
-Wati!
-Karta!

843
01:27:43.125 --> 01:27:44.458
-Drajat!
-Wati!

844
01:27:45.792 --> 01:27:48.042
-Drajat!
-Karta!

845
01:27:48.917 --> 01:27:52.375
-Drajat!
-Karta!

846
01:27:52.458 --> 01:27:56.625
-Karta!
-Drajat!

847
01:27:56.708 --> 01:27:59.875
-Oh. God. what happened to your hand?
-What happened?

848
01:27:59.958 --> 01:28:04.417
What happened?

849
01:28:05.292 --> 01:28:07.833
-Karta!
-Karta! Oh. dear.

850
01:28:18.167 --> 01:28:20.667
So last night…

851
01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:22.333
Weak knees.

852
01:28:29.417 --> 01:28:30.458
Nature calls.

853
01:28:41.292 --> 01:28:42.458
Uncle.

854
01:28:45.208 --> 01:28:48.208
Uncle. Adi is in danger.

855
01:28:48.292 --> 01:28:50.792
We need to save Adi now. Uncle.

856
01:28:57.667 --> 01:28:58.708
Adi.

857
01:28:59.833 --> 01:29:01.125
Let's go pray.

858
01:29:09.708 --> 01:29:10.792
You…

859
01:29:12.042 --> 01:29:13.625
How do you know?

860
01:29:14.792 --> 01:29:16.417
That Adi is in danger?

861
01:29:17.792 --> 01:29:19.583
I got a message from Miss Woro.

862
01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.208
All right. I'll be waiting.

863
01:29:35.792 --> 01:29:38.833
God is Great!

864
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:45.667
God is Great!

865
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:50.417
Not again… not again… not again…

866
01:29:52.250 --> 01:29:53.667
Uncle.

867
01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:00.333
-Uncle. fight it. You must fight it!
-No! No. no!

868
01:30:00.417 --> 01:30:01.917
Take it.

869
01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.292
-You have to fight it.
-Take all of it.

870
01:30:07.708 --> 01:30:08.917
Uncle.

871
01:30:09.917 --> 01:30:12.208
The adhan is not your enemy. Uncle.

872
01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:15.625
God isn't either.

873
01:30:16.792 --> 01:30:18.125
You have to fight it.

874
01:30:19.792 --> 01:30:22.250
Calm down.

875
01:30:23.167 --> 01:30:24.708
Let's go.

876
01:30:27.125 --> 01:30:28.625
What a relief.

877
01:30:30.125 --> 01:30:33.625
Time for coffee.

878
01:30:45.625 --> 01:30:47.708
Ayu.

879
01:30:47.792 --> 01:30:49.833
Go save Adi.

880
01:30:50.417 --> 01:30:53.125
-I'll take care of your teacher.
-Yes. Uncle.

881
01:30:59.208 --> 01:31:00.375
Hello?

882
01:31:02.125 --> 01:31:03.417
-Yes.
-Sir?

883
01:31:05.833 --> 01:31:07.667
-Ayu?
-Where is Adi?

884
01:31:08.083 --> 01:31:11.500
-He is inside.
-Sir. Adi is in danger. sir.

885
01:31:11.583 --> 01:31:12.458
What do you mean?

886
01:31:13.542 --> 01:31:14.625
Calm down.

887
01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:16.542
Adi?

888
01:31:19.208 --> 01:31:20.250
Adi?

889
01:31:23.833 --> 01:31:26.125
Where did he go? Adi?

890
01:31:27.417 --> 01:31:28.542
Adi?

891
01:32:37.167 --> 01:32:39.208
Karta.

892
01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:48.000
The boy that I let live.

893
01:33:03.625 --> 01:33:04.917
I…

894
01:33:07.292 --> 01:33:09.458
still remember…

895
01:33:11.208 --> 01:33:15.917
how sweet your finger tasted.

896
01:33:27.917 --> 01:33:29.083
Karta?

897
01:33:33.417 --> 01:33:35.500
Don't you remember me?

898
01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:43.083
Don't you miss Drajat?

899
01:33:51.875 --> 01:33:55.625
Have you forgotten about me?

900
01:33:56.875 --> 01:33:59.000
Wati?

901
01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.958
Let's play!

902
01:34:23.417 --> 01:34:26.917
Let's play!

903
01:34:29.792 --> 01:34:35.500
All night long with friends.

904
01:34:43.417 --> 01:34:46.917
Let's play!

905
01:34:47.917 --> 01:34:51.542
Let's play!

906
01:34:52.708 --> 01:34:55.458
All night long

907
01:34:55.542 --> 01:34:59.958
with friends.

908
01:35:01.042 --> 01:35:06.000
What can you do. naughty boy?

909
01:35:08.833 --> 01:35:14.208
You want to fight me
with a missing finger?

910
01:35:16.208 --> 01:35:17.625
No.

911
01:35:17.708 --> 01:35:19.708
Your friend is getting old.

912
01:35:20.917 --> 01:35:25.083
It's time for me to get new clothes.

913
01:35:29.125 --> 01:35:30.625
Go away. Go away!

914
01:35:32.292 --> 01:35:33.625
Curse you!

915
01:35:34.708 --> 01:35:37.625
Go away! Leave us alone!

916
01:36:10.208 --> 01:36:12.042
