00:08:21.234 --> 00:08:24.400
He gave the goal. and we all
know what happened after that.

176
00:08:24.435 --> 00:08:25.973
And he should have
been off the field.

177
00:08:26.008 --> 00:08:27.205
- [Reporter] So. what do
you want to see today?

178
00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.504
- I want to see England
win without cheat.

179
00:08:29.539 --> 00:08:31.077
- [Reporter] Will you
encourage your players

180
00:08:31.112 --> 00:08:34.476
to follow Maradona's example
and cheat. if necessary.

181
00:08:34.511 --> 00:08:35.378
to beat England?

182
00:08:36.788 --> 00:08:39.954
In football. he says.
copying isn't authentic.

183
00:08:39.989 --> 00:08:43.694
Every player has to express
himself in the best way.

184
00:08:43.729 --> 00:08:45.762
He praised England's
young players.

185
00:08:45.797 --> 00:08:48.325
Owen and Beckham. likely
to start tomorrow.

186
00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.964
in an unchanged lineup.

187
00:08:49.999 --> 00:08:53.198
- Revenge. I'm sure. is one
word that's going to be used

188
00:08:53.233 --> 00:08:54.034
an awful lot.

189
00:08:55.235 --> 00:08:56.531
If you want to call
it that. you can.

190
00:08:56.566 --> 00:08:57.840
But the most important
thing is that we get

191
00:08:57.875 --> 00:08:59.435
the right result.

192
00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.844
And if. after the game. we can
call it revenge. then great.

193
00:09:02.913 --> 00:09:05.881
(fans singing)

194
00:09:05.916 --> 00:09:09.511
(fans singing in Spanish)

195
00:09:10.822 --> 00:09:15.286
- You'll never take the focus.
you'll never take the focus.

196
00:09:15.321 --> 00:09:17.761
- [Reporter] Another flash of
brilliance from David Beckham

197
00:09:17.796 --> 00:09:19.829
might help England
get the right result.

198
00:09:19.864 --> 00:09:22.634
but the squad isn't
underestimating their task.

199
00:09:23.868 --> 00:09:25.868
- We've had a lot
of a good players.

200
00:09:25.903 --> 00:09:28.167
so I think we can win easily.

201
00:09:28.202 --> 00:09:30.400
- Two one England.
Shearer. golden goal.

202
00:09:30.435 --> 00:09:33.073
- Of course. us-
- Two zero.

203
00:09:33.108 --> 00:09:34.437
- Two zero.

204
00:09:34.472 --> 00:09:36.813
I'm very sorry for the
English people. but-

205
00:09:36.848 --> 00:09:38.881
- We're going to win.
- We are the best.

206
00:09:39.884 --> 00:09:41.686
Sorry. man. You have the money.

207
00:09:41.721 --> 00:09:45.580
We have the quality and
the skills. The ability.

208
00:09:45.615 --> 00:09:47.758
- It's bigger than
you. It's the same.

209
00:09:47.793 --> 00:09:48.891
I want to win.

210
00:09:48.926 --> 00:09:50.453
All the people in
Argentina want to win

211
00:09:50.488 --> 00:09:52.026
because football is the best.

212
00:09:52.061 --> 00:09:53.588
- One nil to England.

213
00:09:53.623 --> 00:09:54.930
- Three two. We're getting
stronger and stronger.

214
00:09:54.965 --> 00:09:56.195
- We're going to win here.

215
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:57.526
and then we're going
to win in Marseilles.

216
00:09:57.561 --> 00:09:59.638
And then we'll end up
winning the World Cup.

217
00:10:03.875 --> 00:10:06.502
- [Narrator] England quickly
experienced early heartbreak.

218
00:10:06.537 --> 00:10:09.637
when Argentina scored a
penalty in the sixth minute.

219
00:10:09.672 --> 00:10:12.640
However. it wasn't long
before England returned

220
00:10:12.675 --> 00:10:14.378
with a penalty of their own.

221
00:10:15.788 --> 00:10:16.886
- [Man] Go on.

222
00:10:16.921 --> 00:10:18.481
- [Narrator] With
England taking the lead

223
00:10:18.516 --> 00:10:19.284
in the 16th minute.

224
00:10:20.221 --> 00:10:22.727
(men shouting)

225
00:10:25.358 --> 00:10:28.733
Argentina were able to equalize
on the stroke of the half.

226
00:10:33.036 --> 00:10:36.631
Two two at halftime. England
looked the stronger team.

227
00:10:36.666 --> 00:10:39.436
but then disaster struck.

228
00:10:39.471 --> 00:10:41.042
- [Commentator] Quite
what was required.

229
00:10:41.077 --> 00:10:44.672
Indeed there was that
challenge on Beckham.

230
00:10:44.707 --> 00:10:46.784
Now. whether
Beckham accidentally

231
00:10:48.854 --> 00:10:51.723
smacked into the defender.
Sineone. the midfielder.

232
00:10:51.758 --> 00:10:53.087
I don't know.

233
00:10:53.122 --> 00:10:54.891
For Beckham. it's a red
card. for David Beckham.

234
00:10:56.422 --> 00:10:57.190
Oh no.

235
00:11:01.801 --> 00:11:03.031
- It definitely cost
England the match.

236
00:11:03.066 --> 00:11:05.198
I had a great view
of the incident.

237
00:11:05.233 --> 00:11:07.068
He lashed out at the guy.

238
00:11:07.103 --> 00:11:08.366
The guy was going to
get booked anyway.

239
00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:09.807
There's no need
for it whatsoever.

240
00:11:09.842 --> 00:11:11.171
- But I think we're
better than the Argies.

241
00:11:11.206 --> 00:11:13.811
but all I can say. like.

242
00:11:13.846 --> 00:11:16.440
just penalties again. isn't it?

243
00:11:16.475 --> 00:11:18.343
Penalty shoot out
again. Can't believe it.

244
00:11:18.378 --> 00:11:20.642
- Beckham was out
of order. basically.

245
00:11:20.677 --> 00:11:21.709
He should have
stayed on the field.

246
00:11:21.744 --> 00:11:23.821
and if he had have done.
we'd have got through.

247
00:11:23.856 --> 00:11:27.682
- Last night. mate.
gutted. Absolutely gutted.

248
00:11:27.717 --> 00:11:29.453
- To get sent off
in a match like that

249
00:11:29.488 --> 00:11:30.993
is a disgrace to anybody.

250
00:11:31.028 --> 00:11:32.830
I'm sorry for his career.

251
00:11:32.865 --> 00:11:33.798
- Whatever.

252
00:11:34.834 --> 00:11:38.264
I mean. I just feel
really bad. I mean.

253
00:11:38.299 --> 00:11:39.771
- [Man] We're all disappointed.

254
00:11:39.806 --> 00:11:41.872
and we'll all talk about
it for years to come.

255
00:11:41.907 --> 00:11:43.841
- Sending off cost us dearly.

256
00:11:43.876 --> 00:11:45.436
- We played with 10
men for half the game.

257
00:11:45.471 --> 00:11:46.877
and we deserved to win.

258
00:11:46.912 --> 00:11:48.373
- Gutted is the word.

259
00:11:48.408 --> 00:11:51.277
- The best team did win.
Best team did win. Well done.

260
00:11:51.312 --> 00:11:53.345
- Good man. Very good.

261
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.546
- [Reporter] England's players
left the stadium slowly.

262
00:11:56.581 --> 00:12:00.759
some clearly upset. their
World Cup dream and shreds.

263
00:12:01.993 --> 00:12:03.960
Dreams shattered for
their children too.

264
00:12:03.995 --> 00:12:05.324
though after three weeks.

265
00:12:05.359 --> 00:12:08.162
they at least had
their fathers back.

266
00:12:08.197 --> 00:12:10.692
As David Batty and the
rest waited for their bus.

267
00:12:10.727 --> 00:12:14.036
the Argentine team pulled
alongside in theirs.

268
00:12:14.071 --> 00:12:16.665
As they passed England's
players and families.

269
00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:19.404
they cheered and
gestured and chanted.

270
00:12:22.211 --> 00:12:25.410
And then. it was time to go.
with pride. said the coach.

271
00:12:25.445 --> 00:12:27.885
- Very proud. and I think the
nation should be proud as well

272
00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:28.886
at that performance.

273
00:12:28.921 --> 00:12:31.119
and the way that
we've had to go.

274
00:12:31.154 --> 00:12:33.891
- [Narrator] But the nation
were anything but proud.

275
00:12:34.817 --> 00:12:37.224
(tense music)

276
00:12:50.943 --> 00:12:52.503
Beckham had his
chance at redemption

277
00:12:52.538 --> 00:12:54.802
on the 6th of October. 2001.

278
00:12:54.837 --> 00:12:58.806
when England faced Greece in
the 2002 World Cup qualifiers.

279
00:12:58.841 --> 00:13:01.413
- [Commentator] Another
attempt at goal.

280
00:13:01.448 --> 00:13:04.119
(crowd shouting)

281
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:10.895
We've played two and a half
minutes of stoppage time.

282
00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:12.930
England trail by
two goals to one.

283
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.596
Beckham could raise the
roof here with a goal.

284
00:13:22.238 --> 00:13:24.139
- [David] It's something
I just want to say.

285
00:13:24.174 --> 00:13:26.306
I know. as England
captain that. you know.

286
00:13:26.341 --> 00:13:28.803
I am obligated and I
need to talk to the fans.

287
00:13:28.838 --> 00:13:30.244
and that's why I'm here.

288
00:13:30.279 --> 00:13:32.807
But I think I'm not
talking about Sky Sports.

289
00:13:32.842 --> 00:13:35.282
because there's a difference
between Sky Sports

290
00:13:35.317 --> 00:13:37.548
and the news side.

291
00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:40.925
and I think the way the
news side have treated me

292
00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.752
in the last few months has
been an absolute disgrace.

293
00:13:43.787 --> 00:13:45.930
I've done the same with
the News Of The World.

294
00:13:45.965 --> 00:13:47.932
because I think
they've tried to.

295
00:13:49.067 --> 00:13:50.858
you know. ruin my family.

296
00:13:50.893 --> 00:13:53.333
I think that I've done
the same with the Mail.

297
00:13:53.368 --> 00:13:56.567
because I've been
called a bad father.

298
00:13:56.602 --> 00:13:58.008
I've been called a bad husband.

299
00:13:58.043 --> 00:14:00.208
and my wife's been
called a bad mother.

300
00:14:00.243 --> 00:14:01.374
- [Reporter] Does
it hurt. David.

301
00:14:01.409 --> 00:14:05.147
when these allegations
are put about?

302
00:14:05.182 --> 00:14:06.445
- Of course.

303
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.018
As I said. you know.
things always hurt

304
00:14:08.053 --> 00:14:09.921
that that said about my family.

305
00:14:09.956 --> 00:14:14.585
and for people to call my
wife a bad mother. you know.

306
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.785
is unbelievable.

307
00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.931
And you know. that's all I
want to say on the matter.

308
00:14:19.966 --> 00:14:20.998
- [Man] Sit down.

309
00:14:21.033 --> 00:14:22.560
- [Man] Come on.
- [Man] Sit down.

310
00:14:22.595 --> 00:14:25.827
(people shouting)

311
00:14:25.862 --> 00:14:28.599
- Regretfully. you will
have heard that my contract

312
00:14:28.634 --> 00:14:32.570
with the FA has been
terminated by mutual consent.

313
00:14:32.605 --> 00:14:35.980
- [Narrator] By 1998.
Beckham had won 10 trophies

314
00:14:36.015 --> 00:14:37.410
with Man United.

315
00:14:37.445 --> 00:14:41.711
However. nothing would prepare
him for the '98 '99 season.

319
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:55.098
but at Manchester Airport fans
have been queuing to leave

320
00:14:55.133 --> 00:14:57.034
since three o'clock
this morning.

321
00:14:57.069 --> 00:15:00.004
Police now say that up
to 50.000 of the red army

322
00:15:00.039 --> 00:15:02.270
will be making the journey
to support their heroes.

323
00:15:02.305 --> 00:15:05.471
with only about 35.000
tickets officially allocated.

324
00:15:05.506 --> 00:15:07.979
The rest say they're going
simply for the atmosphere.

325
00:15:08.014 --> 00:15:09.409
Authorities believe
they'll make this

326
00:15:09.444 --> 00:15:11.609
the biggest ever exodus
of British fans abroad

327
00:15:11.644 --> 00:15:13.512
to watch a single
football match.

328
00:15:13.547 --> 00:15:15.316
And it's through Manchester
Airport today and tomorrow

329
00:15:15.351 --> 00:15:16.911
that the majority
are making their way.

330
00:15:16.946 --> 00:15:20.090
- This is the busiest four
days in the airport's history.

331
00:15:20.125 --> 00:15:23.951
We've got 225 additional

I've checked everything I
have to get here. you know?

335
00:15:29.794 --> 00:15:33.037
It's just one of them things.
you've just got to be there.

336
00:15:33.072 --> 00:15:35.369
You'd miss it if
you didn't turn up.

337
00:15:35.404 --> 00:15:36.964
- It's history.

338
00:15:36.999 --> 00:15:39.076
It's a one-off match. isn't it?

339
00:15:39.111 --> 00:15:42.904
So will just probably
never happen again.

340

345
00:15:56.491 --> 00:15:59.096

camped outside the stadium.

346
00:15:59.131 --> 00:16:01.032
waiting for kickoff.

347
00:16:01.067 --> 00:16:03.991
They've come here from
all over the world.

348
00:16:04.026 --> 00:16:05.795
Where've you come from
to watch this match?

349
00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:07.170

350
00:16:07.205 --> 00:16:08.765
- All the way from India? Why?
- That's right.

351

Well. Man United supporters.

Lived in England. so this
is a unique opportunity

353
00:16:12.837 --> 00:16:15.244

- [Reporter] Is it worth
coming all the way?

355
00:16:16.841 --> 00:16:18.049
- Absolutely.

356
00:16:18.084 --> 00:16:19.116
If you're passionate
about your team.

357
00:16:19.151 --> 00:16:20.711
you follow them
wherever they are.

358
00:16:20.746 --> 00:16:22.119

a sea of fans who seem

361

to have taken over the
city ahead of the final.

362
00:16:30.228 --> 00:16:32.096
Both Manchester United
and Bayern Munich

363
00:16:32.131 --> 00:16:34.428
will have 30.000
inside the ground.

364
00:16:34.463 --> 00:16:36.166
Thousands more who can't get in

365
00:16:36.201 --> 00:16:40.170
say they just want to be here
to soak up the atmosphere.

366
00:16:40.205 --> 00:16:42.029
- Fantastic. Absolutely superb.

367
00:16:42.064 --> 00:16:43.437
- [Reporter] Yeah.
- It's a joy to be here.

368
00:16:43.472 --> 00:16:45.439
- I mean. the atmosphere
alone is worth coming for.

369
00:16:45.474 --> 00:16:46.605
It's superb.

370
00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.211
The weather and
everything. It's great.

371
00:16:48.246 --> 00:16:51.148
- Soaking up the atmosphere
in Barcelona. aren't you?

372
00:16:51.183 --> 00:16:52.446
- [Reporter] There's
still new official word

373
00:16:52.481 --> 00:16:54.151
about the fitness
of David Beckham.

374
00:16:54.186 --> 00:16:56.813
He finished training with his
right leg heavily strapped.

375
00:16:56.848 --> 00:16:58.716
He says he'll be fine.

376
00:16:58.751 --> 00:17:01.323
It's the only fitness doubt
Alex Ferguson has to deal with

377
00:17:01.358 --> 00:17:03.050
before he names his side

378
00:17:03.085 --> 00:17:05.360
for the biggest
match in his career.

379
00:17:05.395 --> 00:17:06.922
- [Narrator] With
Beckham match fit.

380
00:17:06.957 --> 00:17:09.496

Barcelona with the hopes

381
00:17:09.531 --> 00:17:11.234
of doing the unimaginable.

382
00:17:11.269 --> 00:17:14.270
Dreaming of once again
bringing the European Cup

383
00:17:14.305 --> 00:17:15.832
back to old Trafford.

384
00:17:17.033 --> 00:17:19.473
However. their dreams
were quickly challenged

385
00:17:19.508 --> 00:17:22.707
when Bayern Munich's right
midfielder. Mario Basler.

386
00:17:22.742 --> 00:17:24.808
scored a low driven free kick.

387
00:17:24.843 --> 00:17:27.118
beating Peter Schmeichel
at the far post

388
00:17:27.153 --> 00:17:28.251
after six minutes.

389
00:17:29.452 --> 00:17:30.319
- [Commentator]
And at half time.

390
00:17:30.354 --> 00:17:33.256
United nil. Bayern Munich one.

391
00:17:33.291 --> 00:17:35.588
As the clock ticks on to.

392
00:17:35.623 --> 00:17:39.394
well. within 10 seconds
at the end of the 90.

393
00:17:39.429 --> 00:17:41.088
- [Narrator] With three
minutes of added time.

394
00:17:41.123 --> 00:17:42.364
and one goal down.

395
00:17:42.399 --> 00:17:44.828
United needed a miracle.

396
00:17:44.863 --> 00:17:48.205
Rising to the challenge. a
24-year-old David Beckham

397
00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:51.208
steps up to take two corners
with his trademark whip.

398
00:17:55.005 --> 00:17:56.411
- [Commentator] They've
got that one away.

399
00:17:56.446 --> 00:17:57.643
have they as well.

400
00:17:58.316 --> 00:18:00.514
Giggs plugs it back inside.

401
00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:03.286
Has equalized for
Manchester United.

402
00:18:03.321 --> 00:18:05.354
Can you believe this?

403
00:18:05.389 --> 00:18:09.457
Now. just got one last
corner. perhaps. to survive.

404
00:18:09.492 --> 00:18:11.756
Beckham to swing
this one in again.

405
00:18:11.791 --> 00:18:14.165
Sharing it with Solskjaer.

406
00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:17.091
What a goal for
Manchester United.

407
00:18:17.126 --> 00:18:19.830
(crowd cheering)

408
00:18:22.098 --> 00:18:27.068
He's only gone and won the
Champion's League for them.

409
00:18:27.103 --> 00:18:29.807
(dramatic music)

410
00:18:32.581 --> 00:18:35.516
The impossible just
became reality.

411
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:39.289
- I was flat after the game.

412
00:18:39.324 --> 00:18:41.082
because I just
couldn't believe it.

413
00:18:41.117 --> 00:18:42.325
And when I get back to the hotel

414
00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.119
and tell my family. then
I was able to enjoy it.

415
00:18:46.529 --> 00:18:48.826
- [Narrator] 1999
marked a turning point

416
00:18:48.861 --> 00:18:50.597
in Beckham's career.

417
00:18:50.632 --> 00:18:52.236
After winning the
Champion's League.

418
00:18:52.271 --> 00:18:55.602
to complete the illustrious
treble with Man United.

419
00:18:55.637 --> 00:18:59.210
the only time an English
club has completed the feat.

420
00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:02.807
- [Reporter] '92 to '99. if
you can pick just one moment?

421
00:19:04.283 --> 00:19:06.382
- Winning the treble. It doesn't
get any better than that.

422
00:19:09.288 --> 00:19:11.387
- [Man] Unbelievable.
You can't beat it.

423
00:19:11.422 --> 00:19:14.984
Never experienced anything
like that in our lives.

424
00:19:15.019 --> 00:19:17.151
- [Man] The game is
absolutely brilliant.

425
00:19:17.186 --> 00:19:18.922
- [Man] Happiest day of my life.

426
00:19:18.957 --> 00:19:20.957
Happiest day of my life.

427
00:19:22.598 --> 00:19:27.403
- [Man] It's right up there
alongside my son being born.

428
00:19:42.849 --> 00:19:46.356
- Well. I think the
big problem for me.

429
00:19:46.391 --> 00:19:48.116
I'm a football man. really.

430
00:19:49.427 --> 00:19:51.295
He fell in love with Victoria.

431
00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:53.792
That changed
everything. I think.

432
00:19:53.827 --> 00:19:56.531
Well. it was a different
type of marriage

433
00:19:56.566 --> 00:19:58.830
from what you would
normally expect

434
00:20:00.097 --> 00:20:01.635
of a player and football player.

435
00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:04.704
And because she was quite
a famous person. of course.

436
00:20:04.739 --> 00:20:07.102
I mean. part of a
pop group like that.

437
00:20:09.139 --> 00:20:11.645
So that changed the dynamics
of his life. really.

438
00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.482
- [Reporter] He
embraced celebrity.

439
00:20:13.517 --> 00:20:15.352
- I think he did. Yeah.

440
00:20:15.387 --> 00:20:16.881
- [Narrator] Beckham
had elevated his play

441
00:20:16.916 --> 00:20:18.289
to a world-class level.

442
00:20:18.324 --> 00:20:21.325
and when he married
Victoria in 1999.

443
00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.525
it was time to do the
same to his image.

444
00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:26.297
David Beckham
would become Becks.

445
00:20:26.332 --> 00:20:28.332
Taking on brand deals
and appearances.

446
00:20:28.367 --> 00:20:30.301
Beckham. with the
help from Victoria.

447
00:20:30.336 --> 00:20:33.634
was truly transforming himself
from an average footballer

448
00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:35.504
to a global superstar.

449
00:20:40.038 --> 00:20:41.411
- Two questions about England.

450
00:20:43.272 --> 00:20:44.447
- [Reporter] Shall we talk
about the haircuts first.

451
00:20:44.482 --> 00:20:45.448
and get it out of the way?

452
00:20:45.483 --> 00:20:46.680
- If you want to. Go on.

453
00:20:49.146 --> 00:20:51.080
- [Richard] A few years back.
there was an Ian Botham book.

454
00:20:51.115 --> 00:20:54.358
which was the biggest. and
Dicky Bird brought a book out.

455
00:20:54.393 --> 00:20:55.887
which overtook that.

456
00:20:55.922 --> 00:20:57.790
and Alex Ferguson's
recent one has sold

457
00:20:57.825 --> 00:20:59.363
as many as that. I think.

458
00:20:59.398 --> 00:21:01.156
So it's a competition
between David Beckham

459
00:21:01.191 --> 00:21:03.334
and Alex Ferguson now. I think.

460
00:21:03.369 --> 00:21:05.798
- [Narrator] With
a transformation in
image and popularity

461
00:21:05.833 --> 00:21:08.163
came a transformation in wage.

462
00:21:08.198 --> 00:21:11.672
when in 2002. Beckham signed
a three-year contract.

463
00:21:11.707 --> 00:21:14.169
following months of
negotiations with the club.

464
00:21:14.204 --> 00:21:17.447
mostly concerning extra
payments for his image rights.

465
00:21:17.482 --> 00:21:19.306
the income from his new contract

466
00:21:19.341 --> 00:21:21.418
and his many endorsement
deals made him

467
00:21:21.453 --> 00:21:24.454
the highest paid
player in the world.

468
00:21:24.489 --> 00:21:26.918
- [Reporter] Are massive
salaries ruining the game?

469
00:21:28.394 --> 00:21:31.054
- I think. you know.
with major opportunities.

470
00:21:31.089 --> 00:21:32.363
trying hard to
get this financial

471
00:21:32.398 --> 00:21:34.365
fair play into it.

472
00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.027
and it's a very difficult area.

473
00:21:38.569 --> 00:21:40.437
I think that there's always
ways around these things.

474
00:21:40.472 --> 00:21:42.164
to be honest with you.

475
00:21:42.199 --> 00:21:44.639
but I don't know
how far it can go.

476
00:21:44.674 --> 00:21:46.168
It's dangerous times.
actually. the game.

477
00:21:46.203 --> 00:21:48.379
because of the amount
of money some players

478
00:21:48.414 --> 00:21:50.040
are getting paid.

479
00:21:50.075 --> 00:21:53.241
- David's doing tremendous
well outside of the game.

480
00:21:53.276 --> 00:21:55.683
which is obviously. you know.

481
00:21:55.718 --> 00:21:58.554
been a big part of his
career. as well as football.

482
00:21:59.623 --> 00:22:01.183
And I think that it
was a different era

483
00:22:01.218 --> 00:22:02.459
with Bobby Moore.

484
00:22:02.494 --> 00:22:04.461
There wasn't obviously
the money around.

485
00:22:04.496 --> 00:22:05.924
- [Reporter] Do you fear
for the future of the game

486
00:22:05.959 --> 00:22:08.828
with these massive
salaries swilling around?

487
00:22:08.863 --> 00:22:12.799
- What happened that
somewhere along the line.

488
00:22:12.834 --> 00:22:14.867
the game will get
a rude awakening.

489
00:22:14.902 --> 00:22:16.473
and it'll level out.

490
00:22:16.508 --> 00:22:20.444
It has to. and stability
will come along with that.

491
00:22:21.546 --> 00:22:23.073
And so. you know.

492
00:22:23.108 --> 00:22:26.813
you've got to also admire
the premier division.

493
00:22:26.848 --> 00:22:28.111
It's a great league.

494
00:22:28.146 --> 00:22:29.849
It's a fantastic league.

495
00:22:29.884 --> 00:22:33.347
And the television deal
allows it to survive.

496
00:22:33.382 --> 00:22:35.316
you know. in terms
of being able to pay

497
00:22:35.351 --> 00:22:36.757
the salaries they're paying.

498
00:22:38.794 --> 00:22:40.629
- [Reporter] But it will
get a rude awakening.

499
00:22:40.664 --> 00:22:43.434
- It'll get a rude awakening
somewhere along. yeah.

500
00:22:43.469 --> 00:22:45.964
- We do realize that we
have something to prove.

501
00:22:45.999 --> 00:22:48.769
We will be playing our hearts
out tomorrow for our fans.

502
00:22:48.804 --> 00:22:50.397
our country. and ourselves.

503
00:22:50.432 --> 00:22:52.905
and hopefully. we'll come
away with the right result.

504
00:22:55.547 --> 00:22:58.548
- Are you at all
concerned that you've lost

505
00:22:58.583 --> 00:23:00.913
a bit of sympathy with
England supporters

506
00:23:00.948 --> 00:23:03.113
after the events of this week?

507
00:23:03.148 --> 00:23:05.247
- Once we step onto
that pitch. you know.

508
00:23:05.282 --> 00:23:07.491
they'll realize and they'll
see in the boys' faces

509
00:23:07.526 --> 00:23:10.120
that. you know.
everything's behind us.

510
00:23:10.155 --> 00:23:12.320
and we want England to do well.

511
00:23:12.355 --> 00:23:15.026
- You don't think this
pampered millionaire image

512
00:23:15.061 --> 00:23:18.667
that has been put about has
slightly rebounded on you?

513
00:23:18.702 --> 00:23:20.834
The. "Who the hell do you
think you are?" Headlines.

514
00:23:20.869 --> 00:23:21.967
That kind of thing?

515
00:23:23.575 --> 00:23:25.509
- No. because I think that

516
00:23:25.544 --> 00:23:27.907
them headlines will
probably always be there.

517
00:23:27.942 --> 00:23:30.514
whilst. you know. the
wages are what they are.

518
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:32.549
But you know. to be honest.

519
00:23:32.584 --> 00:23:34.243
that's always going to
be there. as I said.

520
00:23:34.278 --> 00:23:38.786
So. you know. we're prepared
to take the criticism.

521
00:23:38.821 --> 00:23:41.085
because you know. we've
put ourselves out there.

522
00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:44.594
and we're well
prepared to take that.

523
00:23:44.629 --> 00:23:46.563
But once we're on the pitch.

524
00:23:46.598 --> 00:23:48.829
people realize how
much football does mean

525
00:23:48.864 --> 00:23:50.325
to every one of us.

526
00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.767
And after the World
Cup. you know.

527
00:23:52.802 --> 00:23:54.967
I had to come away and do well.

528
00:23:55.002 --> 00:23:56.639
and do well that season.

529
00:23:56.674 --> 00:23:59.004
And I felt I did. and
I've come on from there.

530
00:24:00.238 --> 00:24:01.743
and it's made me
a stronger person.

531
00:24:09.478 --> 00:24:10.851
- [Commentator] Beckham
could raise the roof here

532
00:24:10.886 --> 00:24:11.687
with a goal.

533
00:24:13.559 --> 00:24:15.658
I don't believe it.

534
00:24:15.693 --> 00:24:20.157
David Beckham scores
the goal to take England

535
00:24:20.192 --> 00:24:23.028
all the way to the
World Cup finals.

536
00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:26.295
Give that man a knighthood.

537
00:24:27.639 --> 00:24:29.397
- Obviously. you
know. World Cup.

538
00:24:30.675 --> 00:24:32.906
we all know that anything
can happen once you're there.

539
00:24:32.941 --> 00:24:35.678
You've got to have a
certain amount of luck.

540
00:24:35.713 --> 00:24:38.043
And obviously people are
saying that it is too early

541
00:24:38.078 --> 00:24:40.815
for this team to go and
win a major competition.

542
00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:43.114
But I don't feel like it is.

543
00:24:44.986 --> 00:24:46.953
- [Narrator] With Beckham's
career on the rise.

544
00:24:46.988 --> 00:24:49.384
it seemed as though
nothing would stop him.

545
00:24:49.419 --> 00:24:53.894
both as an illusive right-winger
and as a media powerhouse.

546
00:24:53.929 --> 00:24:57.667
Having qualified for the group
stages. spirits were high.

547
00:24:58.769 --> 00:25:00.637
- You know. I feel
that we can go there.

548
00:25:00.672 --> 00:25:04.740
and if we get through the first
stages of the competition.

549
00:25:04.775 --> 00:25:07.336
then I feel that
anything can happen.

550
00:25:08.614 --> 00:25:10.878
- [Narrator] With a new
manager. Sven-Goran Eriksson.

551
00:25:13.443 --> 00:25:15.718
and new captain David Beckham.

552
00:25:15.753 --> 00:25:20.118
2002 looked like the
year football would
finally come home.

553
00:25:20.153 --> 00:25:21.119
- Yes.

554
00:25:21.154 --> 00:25:24.595
(crowd chanting)

555
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:26.289
- [Man] Absolutely fantastic.

556
00:25:26.324 --> 00:25:28.599
It's the best day of my life.

557
00:25:28.634 --> 00:25:31.195
- [Narrator] But
then. disaster struck.

558
00:25:33.771 --> 00:25:36.739
Whilst playing for Man United
in a Champions League game

559
00:25:36.774 --> 00:25:39.170
against Deportivo La Coruna.

560
00:25:39.205 --> 00:25:43.108
Beckham broke the
second metatarsal
bone in his left foot.

561
00:25:43.143 --> 00:25:46.276
injuring him for the
remainder of the season.

562
00:25:46.311 --> 00:25:48.784
(somber music)

563
00:25:50.282 --> 00:25:51.688
- Well. the metatarsal bones

564
00:25:51.723 --> 00:25:53.756
are some of the major load
bearing bones in the foot.

565
00:25:53.791 --> 00:25:55.692
So if he's broken or
fractured one of those.

566
00:25:55.727 --> 00:25:57.452
and we see the
metatarsal bone here.

567
00:25:57.487 --> 00:25:58.926
flashing in red on the screen.

568
00:25:58.961 --> 00:26:00.763
that means he's going to
be unable to take weight

569
00:26:00.798 --> 00:26:02.193
through the bone or
through the foot.

570
00:26:02.228 --> 00:26:04.635
And if you can't do that. you
certainly can't play football.

571
00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:06.769
- I had a stress fracture
in the fifth metatarsal

572
00:26:06.804 --> 00:26:07.671
of my left foot.

573
00:26:09.268 --> 00:26:11.906
I did it in a
game. just running.

574
00:26:11.941 --> 00:26:13.644
It just broke down.

575
00:26:13.679 --> 00:26:16.075
and it took me
three months exactly

576
00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:17.813
to come back. playing.

577
00:26:17.848 --> 00:26:19.012
- Very difficult to
say at this minute.

578
00:26:19.047 --> 00:26:21.212
We're not too sure the
type of fracture he has.

579
00:26:21.247 --> 00:26:23.445
but if all goes well
and the bone heals up

580
00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.754
within the eight weeks.

581
00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:26.789
he's still going to be missing
a lot of match fitness.

582
00:26:26.824 --> 00:26:28.692
So I would imagine
he'll probably miss

583
00:26:28.727 --> 00:26:31.387
the opening group stages.
but if he does come back.

584
00:26:31.422 --> 00:26:33.092
we'll probably see him
initially coming in.

585
00:26:33.127 --> 00:26:34.731
playing a substitute role.

586
00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.430
- What I think about that?

587
00:26:41.465 --> 00:26:42.838
- [Reporter] You think
it can have any effect?

588
00:26:42.873 --> 00:26:45.434
- If it has an effect.
please do it. all of you.

589
00:26:45.469 --> 00:26:47.711
(all laughing)

590
00:26:47.746 --> 00:26:50.241
- The whole business of
The Sun calling for people

591
00:26:50.276 --> 00:26:51.638
to pray for Beckham.

592
00:26:51.673 --> 00:26:55.312
I hope. hope it's
an elaborate joke.

593
00:26:55.347 --> 00:26:58.414
because if it isn't.
then we are all doomed.

594
00:27:00.792 --> 00:27:03.122
- [Sven] After the
session he had today.

595
00:27:03.157 --> 00:27:07.896
he felt very well. no
complaints. no pain at all.

596
00:27:07.931 --> 00:27:09.799
So that's very positive.

597
00:27:09.834 --> 00:27:11.394
- Hopefully this week.

598
00:27:11.429 --> 00:27:13.429
it would be great to welcome
a few of the players back

599
00:27:13.464 --> 00:27:16.003
onto the training pitch. and
hopefully. David's one of them.

600
00:27:16.038 --> 00:27:20.634
- [Alex] David's slim.
tall. angular. human being.

601
00:27:20.669 --> 00:27:23.439
Natural fit boy.
natural athlete.

602
00:27:23.474 --> 00:27:25.342
Beckham's natural.

603
00:27:25.377 --> 00:27:27.718
So. after his metatarsal injury.

604
00:27:27.753 --> 00:27:30.886
I was very confident that
David would no problem

605
00:27:30.921 --> 00:27:32.723
going to the World Cup.

606
00:27:32.758 --> 00:27:34.351
- [Narrator] A determined
Beckham worked hard

607
00:27:34.386 --> 00:27:36.287
to get back from injury in time

608
00:27:36.322 --> 00:27:39.488
for the opening group stage
game of the competition.

609
00:27:39.523 --> 00:27:40.764
- [Reporter] How's the foot?

610
00:27:40.799 --> 00:27:42.392
- [David] It's a lot
better. A lot better.

611
00:27:42.427 --> 00:27:45.164
I run for the first
time two days ago.

612
00:27:45.199 --> 00:27:46.968
on Saturday morning.

613
00:27:47.003 --> 00:27:51.467
and it was a little bit achy
after. but it's not a problem.

614
00:27:51.502 --> 00:27:52.809
- [Reporter] How is
the x-ray looking?

615
00:27:52.844 --> 00:27:55.240
What are the United
physios saying about this?

616
00:27:55.275 --> 00:27:57.275
- Well. the callus is
forming around the bone.

617
00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:59.882
So. that's the best sign.

618
00:27:59.917 --> 00:28:01.752
Surgeons are really
happy with it.

619
00:28:01.787 --> 00:28:04.854
They've been looking after
me for the last four weeks.

620
00:28:04.889 --> 00:28:08.891
watching it. and it's
really. really come on a lot.

621
00:28:08.926 --> 00:28:11.190
And United physios have
been watching obviously.

622
00:28:11.225 --> 00:28:13.093
and so it's really quite good.

623
00:28:13.128 --> 00:28:16.624
- Metatarsals mended. and
old injuries forgotten.

624
00:28:16.659 --> 00:28:20.463
the air around the team and
their supporters is optimistic.

625
00:28:20.498 --> 00:28:21.662
- I'm feeling confident.

626
00:28:21.697 --> 00:28:22.806
Now we've got
David Beckham back.

627
00:28:22.841 --> 00:28:24.841
that's got to be a
very big positive.

628
00:28:28.913 --> 00:28:30.473
- [Narrator] With
Beckham back from injury.

629
00:28:30.508 --> 00:28:32.882
his dreams of revenge
against the Argentines

630
00:28:32.917 --> 00:28:35.115
were closer than ever.

631
00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:38.052
When England drew Argentina
in the group stage

632
00:28:38.087 --> 00:28:39.185
of the competition.

633
00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.122
- And H one for Japan.

634
00:28:43.191 --> 00:28:44.421
Argentina.

635
00:28:46.524 --> 00:28:47.897
England.

636
00:28:47.932 --> 00:28:50.196
- [Narrator] However. not
everyone was optimistic

637
00:28:50.231 --> 00:28:51.725
about the draw.

638
00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.431
- With Argentina.
well. it's about time

639
00:28:54.466 --> 00:28:56.004
things turned in favor for us.

640
00:28:56.039 --> 00:28:58.633
So. a bit of luck.
a bit of hard work.

641
00:28:58.668 --> 00:29:01.207
and I think probably
make the most of it.

642
00:29:01.242 --> 00:29:05.343
- Sweden. We've not beaten
them for long time. Sweden.

643
00:29:06.478 --> 00:29:07.818
They're a better team than us.

644
00:29:07.853 --> 00:29:09.215
- When we got Nigeria.

645
00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:11.855
I did think. of all the teams
in Africa. to land Nigeria.

646
00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:13.923
It was completely.
completely unfair.

647
00:29:13.958 --> 00:29:15.254
They're the best team out there.

648
00:29:15.289 --> 00:29:17.894
So we've picked the
best in South America.

649
00:29:17.929 --> 00:29:20.831
the best in Africa. and a
reasonably good European team.

650
00:29:20.866 --> 00:29:22.096
I mean. had we had
France as well.

651
00:29:22.131 --> 00:29:23.757
that really would
have been a bit tough.

652
00:29:23.792 --> 00:29:24.934
- [Reporter] It was
off for some training.

653
00:29:24.969 --> 00:29:27.662
a fairly gentle and
relaxed affair today.

654
00:29:27.697 --> 00:29:30.841
with Beckham sporting the
latest of the Mohicans.

655
00:29:30.876 --> 00:29:34.438
And the news from the camp
is all are fit and well.

656
00:29:34.473 --> 00:29:36.011
- I'm going to watch it now.

657
00:29:36.046 --> 00:29:37.012
- [Reporter] You're on your way?

658
00:29:37.047 --> 00:29:37.914
- Yeah.

659
00:29:37.949 --> 00:29:39.212
- I'm missing the first half.

660
00:29:39.247 --> 00:29:40.741
but I'll see the second
half when I get in.

661
00:29:40.776 --> 00:29:44.514
- England's going to
win about a million nil.

662
00:29:45.715 --> 00:29:47.088
- [Narrator] It wasn't
long before Beckham

663
00:29:47.123 --> 00:29:49.750
was given the chance at revenge.

664
00:29:49.785 --> 00:29:52.291
On the 7th of June. 2002.

665
00:29:52.326 --> 00:29:54.964
England played
Argentina yet again.

666
00:29:54.999 --> 00:29:57.934
when on the stroke of the half
England received a penalty.

667
00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.973
(commentator shouting)

668
00:30:04.008 --> 00:30:07.273
- [Narrator] And who else to
take it. other than Beckham?

669
00:30:07.308 --> 00:30:09.803
(heart beat)

670
00:30:26.525 --> 00:30:27.898
- [Commentator] You
can smash them now.

671
00:30:27.933 --> 00:30:30.230
Beckham has scored for England.

672
00:30:30.265 --> 00:30:33.134
44 minutes. and
he's done it again.

673
00:30:33.169 --> 00:30:36.137
(crowd cheering)

674
00:30:36.172 --> 00:30:40.438
David Beckham puts England
in front against Argentina

675
00:30:40.473 --> 00:30:42.044
in Sapporo.

676
00:30:42.079 --> 00:30:43.804
- [Reporter] You
must be very pleased.

677
00:30:43.839 --> 00:30:45.047
- [David] Very. very pleased.

678
00:30:45.082 --> 00:30:46.213
You know.

679
00:30:46.248 --> 00:30:48.083
I think the whole nation
will be pleased tonight.

680
00:30:48.118 --> 00:30:50.448
You know. I think as
a footballing nation.

681
00:30:51.957 --> 00:30:53.187
we've been waiting for this
result for a long time.

682
00:30:53.222 --> 00:30:55.882
I've been waiting for it
for years. but you know.

683
00:30:55.917 --> 00:30:57.455
it means a lot to everyone.

684
00:30:57.490 --> 00:31:00.161
- [Reporter] I was going to
say. how sweet is that for you?

685
00:31:00.196 --> 00:31:02.966
- [David] Well. it's a lot
better than four years ago.

686
00:31:03.001 --> 00:31:04.528
I can tell you that now.

687
00:31:04.563 --> 00:31:07.597
- Absolutely fantastic. It's
the best day of my life.

688
00:31:07.632 --> 00:31:10.072
- Best night of my life.
Absolutely amazing.

689
00:31:10.107 --> 00:31:12.107
I just can't believe it.

690
00:31:12.142 --> 00:31:15.011
We're in Japan. it's the
most amazing country.

691
00:31:15.046 --> 00:31:16.243
The people have been fantastic.

692
00:31:16.278 --> 00:31:18.311
And we've been the Argies. yes.

693
00:31:20.348 --> 00:31:22.051
- [Narrator] Having
solidified his place

694
00:31:22.086 --> 00:31:24.053
as a national team hero.

695
00:31:24.088 --> 00:31:27.188
not everyone was too keen
on the new Mohawk-wearing

696
00:31:27.223 --> 00:31:28.717
designer Becks.

697
00:31:28.752 --> 00:31:30.092
- Fell in love with Victoria.

698
00:31:30.127 --> 00:31:32.226
I think that obviously that
was a big changing point

699
00:31:32.261 --> 00:31:33.788
in his life.

700
00:31:33.823 --> 00:31:35.196
And me being a football man.

701
00:31:36.661 --> 00:31:40.366
I like to see them totally
committed to the team.

702
00:31:40.401 --> 00:31:44.040
and of course that
wind went down a bit.

703
00:31:44.075 --> 00:31:46.977
I always remember one of
the managers saying to me.

704
00:31:47.012 --> 00:31:48.836
"How is it you get
Beckham and Giggsy

705
00:31:48.871 --> 00:31:51.575
to run up and down that
pitch. his wife present.

706
00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:53.742
produce such quality?"

707
00:31:53.777 --> 00:31:57.020
I said. "Because
desire and ability."

708
00:31:57.055 --> 00:32:00.881
And when David went
off that level.

709
00:32:00.916 --> 00:32:05.622
I had to judge whether it
was affecting the performance

710
00:32:05.657 --> 00:32:07.228
of the team.

711
00:32:07.263 --> 00:32:09.197
and also the
control of the team.

712
00:32:09.232 --> 00:32:10.429
- [Narrator]
Following his return

713
00:32:10.464 --> 00:32:12.068
from the metatarsal injury.

714
00:32:12.103 --> 00:32:15.335
Sir Alex Ferguson opted to
go with the second string

715
00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:17.601
right-winger Ole
Gunnar Solskjaer.

716
00:32:19.077 --> 00:32:22.177
- Ole was one of these
rare human beings

717
00:32:22.212 --> 00:32:25.213
that watched every game.
and he took the notes

718
00:32:25.248 --> 00:32:27.281
in every training session.

719
00:32:27.316 --> 00:32:30.515
And it's obviously.
his desire was later on

720
00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:32.352
to be a coach. obviously.

721
00:32:32.387 --> 00:32:34.486
But it's also more than that.

722
00:32:34.521 --> 00:32:38.325
It's about trying to be the
best you possibly can be.

723
00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:39.986
and giving yourself
the best chance.

724
00:32:40.021 --> 00:32:43.099
and taking all the notes down
in the training sessions.

725
00:32:43.134 --> 00:32:45.200
and watching. when he's a sub.

726
00:32:45.235 --> 00:32:50.238
I used to say to the
substitutes thereafter.

727
00:32:51.571 --> 00:32:54.110
referring to Ole Gunnar
Solskjaer. "Watch the game.

728
00:32:54.145 --> 00:32:55.408
Watch the game.

729
00:32:55.443 --> 00:32:57.971
Don't be having a glance
round at the stadium

730
00:32:58.006 --> 00:33:00.050
or chatting to each
other during the game.

731
00:33:00.085 --> 00:33:02.250
Watch the game." And
that's what Ole did.

732
00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:06.485
- [Reporter] Often said
of you about your temper

733
00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:08.091
and the hairdryer treatment.

734
00:33:08.126 --> 00:33:10.918
you say in the book. "I
had terrible mood storms.

735
00:33:10.953 --> 00:33:13.921
and I would sometimes go home
fearing the consequences."

736
00:33:13.956 --> 00:33:16.022
Do you regret those outbursts?

737
00:33:16.057 --> 00:33:18.629
- No. No. I think
you are who you are.

738
00:33:18.664 --> 00:33:19.597
- [Reporter] What
about the football boot

739
00:33:19.632 --> 00:33:20.829
incident with Beckham?

740
00:33:20.864 --> 00:33:22.369
- [Alex] Yeah.
- [Reporter] That was a

741
00:33:22.404 --> 00:33:23.634
loss of temper. wasn't it?

742
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:25.570
- Yeah. it was an
accident. yeah.

743
00:33:25.605 --> 00:33:27.803
But it happened. you know?

744
00:33:27.838 --> 00:33:31.972
And I would have
forgotten about.

745
00:33:32.007 --> 00:33:34.150
and the fact it was David.

746
00:33:35.582 --> 00:33:37.615
it was going to end up
the papers. wasn't it?

747
00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:39.188
I mean. there was no way out.

748
00:33:39.223 --> 00:33:41.652
And of course it became a
bit of an issue at the time.

749
00:33:41.687 --> 00:33:42.950
- [Reporter] Though
details were sketchy.

750
00:33:42.985 --> 00:33:44.985
United manager. Alex
Ferguson admitted

751
00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:47.955
he had kicked the boot
accidentally striking Beckham.

752
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:50.793
At the time. both sides
were keen to play it down.

753
00:33:50.828 --> 00:33:54.269
- [Alex] It was an incident.
which was a freakish...

754
00:33:54.304 --> 00:33:56.205
If I tried it 100 times
or a million times.

755
00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:57.569
it could not happen again.

756
00:33:58.803 --> 00:34:01.375
If I did. I'd have
carried on playing.

757
00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:02.640
He became a great player.

758
00:34:02.675 --> 00:34:05.808
and I think that we've
made the right decision.

759
00:34:05.843 --> 00:34:06.842
in terms of.

760
00:34:08.285 --> 00:34:09.284
you know. when we
go to Real Madrid.

761
00:34:09.319 --> 00:34:11.121
because we felt it was time.

762
00:34:12.322 --> 00:34:13.717
- [Reporter] Being sold
like a piece of meat.

763
00:34:13.752 --> 00:34:15.356
Did that represent your feelings

764
00:34:15.391 --> 00:34:16.687
towards United and
Sir Alex Ferguson?

765
00:34:16.722 --> 00:34:18.656
- I think that I
will miss the fans

766
00:34:18.691 --> 00:34:21.021
and the players that
I've grown up with.

767
00:34:21.056 --> 00:34:24.695
because I've regarded the
players at Manchester United

768
00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:25.630
as my family.

769
00:34:27.205 --> 00:34:29.403
And. you know. I've got a lot
of very special friends there.

770
00:34:29.438 --> 00:34:30.965
A lot of special people.

771
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.407
Everyone's been very
kind to me in Manchester

772
00:34:33.442 --> 00:34:35.178
and looked after
me for 13 years.

773
00:34:35.213 --> 00:34:38.280
And obviously. I'm
sad to leave them.

774
00:34:38.315 --> 00:34:39.908
but you know. I'm
joining Real Madrid.

775
00:34:39.943 --> 00:34:44.946
and that for me is as exciting
as it gets. to be honest.

776
00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:47.586
- I don't think he should go.

777
00:34:47.621 --> 00:34:49.258
I can't understand why they
want to get rid of him.

778
00:34:49.293 --> 00:34:51.788
The lad's totally devoted to
United. He always has been.

779
00:34:51.823 --> 00:34:53.229
And it's not going to
be easy to replace that

780
00:34:53.264 --> 00:34:54.758
with some foreigner.

781
00:34:54.793 --> 00:34:57.299
- I came from Greece
and I want Beckham

782
00:34:57.334 --> 00:34:59.532
to stay in Manchester.

783
00:34:59.567 --> 00:35:00.995
- It would seem on
the surface to be

784
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:02.997
a very serious
conflict of interest.

785
00:35:03.032 --> 00:35:05.340
Obviously. so much money
is earned by progress

786
00:35:05.375 --> 00:35:06.440
in the Champions League.

787
00:35:06.475 --> 00:35:08.244
and maybe Manchester
United don't believe

788
00:35:08.279 --> 00:35:11.280
they'll play Real Madrid
short of the final.

789
00:35:11.315 --> 00:35:13.282
But the whole thing
is full of oddities.

790
00:35:13.317 --> 00:35:15.042
It's almost as if
Manchester United

791
00:35:15.077 --> 00:35:18.078
have acted like a
very desperate seller

792
00:35:18.113 --> 00:35:20.146
to court a very reluctant buyer.

793
00:35:20.181 --> 00:35:24.491
- [Man] It's the worst
bit. the worst. very worst

794
00:35:24.526 --> 00:35:26.988
bit of management
I've ever seen.

795
00:35:27.023 --> 00:35:28.396
- [Woman] He's won
everything at United.

796
00:35:28.431 --> 00:35:30.365
there's nothing more he can win.

797
00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.829
And he's gone from one
world class team to another.

798
00:35:32.864 --> 00:35:34.270
- It may well be a situation.

799
00:35:34.305 --> 00:35:35.799
last game of the
group. for instance.

800
00:35:35.834 --> 00:35:38.604
where. were United
not to win the game

801
00:35:38.639 --> 00:35:39.902
against another rival.

802
00:35:39.937 --> 00:35:41.310
that would allow Real
Madrid to go through.

803
00:35:41.345 --> 00:35:43.037
And I'm not suggesting any
question of impropriety.

804
00:35:43.072 --> 00:35:45.875
but if that happens. certainly
questions will be asked.

805
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:48.009
And that's the last thing
United need at the moment.

806
00:35:48.044 --> 00:35:49.681
is EUFA on their back.

807
00:35:49.716 --> 00:35:51.111
- Backhanded really. isn't it?

808
00:35:51.146 --> 00:35:52.651
It's all been done
behind everybody's back.

809
00:35:52.686 --> 00:35:53.784
- Beckham never wanted to
leave Manchester United.

810
00:35:53.819 --> 00:35:55.456
I think he was pushed out.

811
00:35:55.491 --> 00:35:58.184
- You don't get the wrong
side of Alex Ferguson.

812
00:35:58.219 --> 00:36:00.120
I mean. that's what
this episode shows.

813
00:36:00.155 --> 00:36:01.990
and it's happened again
and again to players.

814
00:36:02.025 --> 00:36:04.366
If they annoy Ferguson.
they're out the door.

815
00:36:04.401 --> 00:36:07.369
He never speaks to them again.
They have to leave United.

816
00:36:07.404 --> 00:36:09.129
- [Reporter] He might
still be an idol.

817
00:36:09.164 --> 00:36:11.802
but the old colors
are coming down.

818
00:36:11.837 --> 00:36:15.201
In the city where this global
phenomena is a local hero.

819
00:36:15.236 --> 00:36:17.445
they've already started
counting the cost.

820
00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:18.941
- [Man] Everything with
David Beckham on it

821
00:36:18.976 --> 00:36:21.141
probably is the biggest selling
part of Manchester United

822
00:36:21.176 --> 00:36:23.352
merchandise that we do is
the David Beckham range.

823
00:36:23.387 --> 00:36:25.013
- [Reporter] So they'll
feel it when he doesn't play

824
00:36:25.048 --> 00:36:25.783
for them anymore.

825
00:36:25.818 --> 00:36:26.784
- Quite possibly.

826
00:36:26.819 --> 00:36:27.983
I should think it would
be quite substantial.

827
00:36:28.018 --> 00:36:29.589
unless they can get somebody
else in with a very big name.

828
00:36:29.624 --> 00:36:32.295
I think they'll
feel it definitely.

829
00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:35.760
- He went to Real Madrid.
and that was a great move

830
00:36:35.795 --> 00:36:38.565
for him. in the sense of two
of the biggest brand names

831
00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:40.061
in the world.

832
00:36:40.096 --> 00:36:43.273
- Why on earth is it? I
mean. he's only a footballer.

833
00:36:43.308 --> 00:36:45.132
He's a good footballer.
but he is only footballer.

834
00:36:45.167 --> 00:36:46.804
and he's become such a celebrity

835
00:36:46.839 --> 00:36:49.103
that it takes over everything.

836
00:36:49.138 --> 00:36:51.578
- [Reporter] And already.
everyone wants a piece of him.

837
00:36:51.613 --> 00:36:53.646
The hospital today didn't
just do his medical.

838
00:36:53.681 --> 00:36:56.418
It's sponsored it.
and insisted he pose

839
00:36:56.453 --> 00:36:58.046
in front of their logo.

840
00:36:58.081 --> 00:37:00.455
Real spent a lot of money
buying one of the world's

841
00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:02.754
most commercially
valuable sportsmen.

842
00:37:02.789 --> 00:37:04.360
They're going to want
to squeeze every penny

843
00:37:04.395 --> 00:37:07.220
they can from the
Beckham bandwagon.

844
00:37:07.255 --> 00:37:08.496
- [Reporter] Figures
released this month

845
00:37:08.531 --> 00:37:09.992
put their annual
income for last year

846
00:37:10.027 --> 00:37:12.335
at 180.000.000 pounds.

847
00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:14.733
32.000.000 more than
Manchester United.

848
00:37:14.768 --> 00:37:16.933
But they still lag
behind the English club

849
00:37:16.968 --> 00:37:18.374
when selling in Asia.

850
00:37:18.409 --> 00:37:20.068
Putting Beckham on the
books could change that.

851
00:37:20.103 --> 00:37:21.608
- But Manchester
United in the Far East

852
00:37:21.643 --> 00:37:23.775
is just phenomenal. really.

853
00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:25.447
It's very. very. very important.

854
00:37:25.482 --> 00:37:29.484
And in certain ways. we're
four. five. six. seven years

855
00:37:29.519 --> 00:37:31.046
behind Manchester
United in that respect.

856
00:37:31.081 --> 00:37:32.520
You know. Manchester United
have got mega stores.

857
00:37:32.555 --> 00:37:35.556
We've got. you know. little
shops and things like that.

858
00:37:35.591 --> 00:37:37.855
- [Reporter] Real
Madrid shirts are here.

859
00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:39.593
but most are being held back.

860
00:37:39.628 --> 00:37:41.892
the pirates planning
to flood the market

861
00:37:41.927 --> 00:37:44.125
within hours of
Beckham's new number

862
00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.830
being announced in Madrid.

863
00:37:45.865 --> 00:37:47.568
(man speaking foreign language)

864
00:37:47.603 --> 00:37:49.064
- [Translator] We have
the shirts in the shops

865
00:37:49.099 --> 00:37:51.341
the day after we
know his new number.

866
00:37:51.376 --> 00:37:53.904
We have to meet the demand
for the Real Madrid kit.

867
00:37:53.939 --> 00:37:57.006
People are already asking.
"Beckham. Beckham. Beckham.

868
00:37:57.041 --> 00:37:58.513
What's his new number?"

869
00:37:58.548 --> 00:38:00.273
(woman speaking
foreign language)

870
00:38:00.308 --> 00:38:02.847
- [Translator] We'll sell
more Real Madrid shirts now.

871
00:38:02.882 --> 00:38:06.818
Beckham is a superstar forever.
All the girls like him.

872
00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.627
- [Reporter] There's
little dispute in Japan

873
00:38:13.662 --> 00:38:17.191
over just who is the world's
greatest football star.

874
00:38:17.226 --> 00:38:18.192
- David Beckham.

875
00:38:19.503 --> 00:38:21.162
- [Narrator] It wasn't
long before Madrid

876
00:38:21.197 --> 00:38:23.439
capitalized on their
new star's image.

877
00:38:23.474 --> 00:38:26.508
organizing a pre-season
tour to south Asia.

878
00:38:26.543 --> 00:38:30.842
It is estimated Beckham's
2003 18 day pre-season tour

879
00:38:30.877 --> 00:38:34.681
to Asia earned Madrid
over 10.000.000 Euro.

880
00:38:37.554 --> 00:38:40.489
In 2001. before
Beckham's arrival.

881
00:38:40.524 --> 00:38:44.955
Madrid had a revenue
of 93.2 million pounds.

882
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:47.925
By 2005. they doubled that.

883
00:38:50.435 --> 00:38:52.963
However. when Beckham
signed for Madrid.

884
00:38:52.998 --> 00:38:55.603
they were a club in a mess.

885
00:38:55.638 --> 00:38:58.936
They were nearly
280.000.000 Euros in debt.

886
00:38:58.971 --> 00:39:01.510
and had become stagnant
in the transfer market.

887
00:39:03.481 --> 00:39:07.175
Club president Florentino
Perez had the perfect answer.

888
00:39:08.882 --> 00:39:12.455
The Galacticos. a group
of high profile players

889
00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:14.248
brought into the
club in an attempt

890
00:39:14.283 --> 00:39:17.526
to create football's
biggest spectacle.

891
00:39:17.561 --> 00:39:20.496
Playing alongside Ronaldo.
Zidane. and Louis Vigo.

892
00:39:20.531 --> 00:39:23.499
Roberto Carlos. Raul.
and Ika Cassius.

893
00:39:23.534 --> 00:39:26.667
Beckham did not require
much time to settle in.

894
00:39:26.702 --> 00:39:29.670
scoring five times in
his first 16 matches

895
00:39:29.705 --> 00:39:31.364
for the Galacticos.

896
00:39:31.399 --> 00:39:34.070
However. despite an
impressive start.

897
00:39:34.105 --> 00:39:37.480
Beckham's time at Madrid didn't
run as smoothly as planned.

898
00:39:37.515 --> 00:39:41.077
with a poor end to
the 2005. 2006 season.

899
00:39:41.112 --> 00:39:43.046
which saw Madrid finish second

900
00:39:43.081 --> 00:39:45.147
to longtime rivals Barcelona.

901
00:39:45.182 --> 00:39:48.590
forcing club president
Florentino Perez to resign.

902
00:39:48.625 --> 00:39:50.284
and big changes were to come.

903
00:39:51.892 --> 00:39:53.089
- [Reporter] Hopefully
you have a thought now

904
00:39:53.124 --> 00:39:54.959
that you could win
this World Cup. David?

905
00:39:54.994 --> 00:39:56.422
- [David] Well. we're not
even thinking about that

906
00:39:56.457 --> 00:39:57.797
at the moment. to be honest.

907
00:39:57.832 --> 00:39:59.062
We let other people do that.

908
00:39:59.097 --> 00:40:00.426
because I'm sure other
people have been getting

909
00:40:00.461 --> 00:40:01.999
sort of carried away with that.

910
00:40:02.034 --> 00:40:03.473
- Brazil is going to
be very difficult.

911
00:40:03.508 --> 00:40:04.771
but if we can do
them. that's it.

912
00:40:04.806 --> 00:40:06.575
- If they can get past
Brazil. they go the whole way.

913
00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:07.906
But obviously that's
a bit of an if.

914
00:40:07.941 --> 00:40:08.973
but there's a good chance.

915
00:40:09.008 --> 00:40:10.172
It's a good chance.

916
00:40:10.207 --> 00:40:11.371
So it we'll be
there in the final-

917
00:40:11.406 --> 00:40:13.076
- Bring on Brazil. Next round.

918
00:40:13.111 --> 00:40:15.144
- The cup's ours. I think.
- Yeah.

919
00:40:15.179 --> 00:40:16.717
- It's coming home.

920
00:40:16.752 --> 00:40:19.346
(upbeat trumpet music)

921
00:40:19.381 --> 00:40:20.688
- [Reporter] If it is Brazil.

922
00:40:20.723 --> 00:40:22.283
it promises to be
an epic encounter.

923
00:40:22.318 --> 00:40:24.527
England have never beaten
them when it matters.

924
00:40:24.562 --> 00:40:28.498
but this is the World Cup. when
you should never say never.

925
00:40:28.533 --> 00:40:30.533
- Well. what we're looking at
is there's three more games

926
00:40:30.568 --> 00:40:31.633
to the World Cup final.

927
00:40:31.668 --> 00:40:35.538
And hopefully. if we can
play like we have done.

928
00:40:35.573 --> 00:40:36.869
then you never know.

929
00:40:36.904 --> 00:40:38.541
- [Reporter] Are we
getting better as a side?

930
00:40:38.576 --> 00:40:40.037
Are you pleased with the
way we're getting better?

931
00:40:40.072 --> 00:40:41.907
- I think we're getting
better and better.

932
00:40:41.942 --> 00:40:46.945
And you see that. when the
comes up. those difficult games.

933
00:40:48.685 --> 00:40:50.113
we are ready.

934
00:40:50.148 --> 00:40:52.720
- [Narrator] After a monumental
win against Argentina.

935
00:40:52.755 --> 00:40:54.887
knocking them out
of the World Cup.

936
00:40:54.922 --> 00:40:57.725
England had a lackluster
remainder of the tournament.

937
00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.595
beating Denmark in the last 16

938
00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:03.698
to ultimately be knocked out
by eventual winners. Brazil.

939
00:41:03.733 --> 00:41:06.965
after a catastrophic error
from goalkeeper David Seaman

940
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.199
saw Ronaldinho score
a 40 yard free kick.

941
00:41:10.234 --> 00:41:12.641
- [Reporter] Seaman left
the stadium. still tearful.

942
00:41:12.676 --> 00:41:14.038
without speaking.

943
00:41:14.073 --> 00:41:16.711
But his captain was quick
to jump to his defense.

944
00:41:16.746 --> 00:41:19.142
- I think if he gets
made a scapegoat.

945
00:41:19.177 --> 00:41:20.407
I think it's an
absolute disgrace.

946
00:41:20.442 --> 00:41:23.014
because I think he's
been the best goalkeeper

947
00:41:23.049 --> 00:41:24.279
in this tournament.

948
00:41:24.314 --> 00:41:26.985
and the goal that
they did score.

949
00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.152
I feel that it was a fluke goal.

950
00:41:29.187 --> 00:41:32.694
but you know. the Brazilians
are a great players.

951
00:41:32.729 --> 00:41:35.488
And as I said. I hope they go
on to win the tournament now.

952
00:41:35.523 --> 00:41:36.764
- Dave is a world class keeper.

953
00:41:36.799 --> 00:41:37.996
No one's putting
the blame on him

954
00:41:38.031 --> 00:41:39.327
or any of the other players.

955
00:41:39.362 --> 00:41:40.768
You know. it's just
one of them things.

956
00:41:40.803 --> 00:41:43.001
- I wouldn't put any
blame on David Seaman.

957
00:41:43.036 --> 00:41:44.739
or any goalkeeper
that that happened to.

958
00:41:44.774 --> 00:41:46.169
I've never seen a corner
kick taken like that.

959
00:41:46.204 --> 00:41:48.644
It was whipped with
more pace and accuracy

960
00:41:48.679 --> 00:41:49.645
than I've ever seen.

961
00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:51.845
- David is a fantastic
professional.

962
00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:55.277
You know. he's been there
for England over the years.

963
00:41:55.312 --> 00:41:57.851
and made fantastic saves
for club and country.

964
00:41:59.118 --> 00:42:01.316
- What can you say? I
think we deserved it.

965
00:42:01.351 --> 00:42:02.185
- We'll be back.

966
00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:03.186
- What are we going to do?

967
00:42:03.221 --> 00:42:05.254
- We'll win the Euros.

968
00:42:05.289 --> 00:42:07.795
- [Reporter] They burnt
a Brazilian shirt.

969
00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:09.665
cheered as if England had won.

970
00:42:11.196 --> 00:42:14.769
For others. silent thoughts
and soft words of consolation.

971
00:42:14.804 --> 00:42:16.529
- [Reporter] So. as the
team kit was being loaded

972
00:42:16.564 --> 00:42:17.937
this evening for
the flight home.

973
00:42:17.972 --> 00:42:20.808
Sven-Goran Eriksson spoke
of how he's told his players

974
00:42:20.843 --> 00:42:22.678
to think of the future.

975
00:42:22.713 --> 00:42:25.681
- I told them that I
think 90. 95% of you

976
00:42:25.716 --> 00:42:26.682
sitting here today.

977
00:42:28.543 --> 00:42:30.620
very sad with the head downs.

978
00:42:30.655 --> 00:42:33.821
You have a big chance to be
in it in four years' time.

979
00:42:36.419 --> 00:42:37.759
- [Narrator] Four years later.

980
00:42:37.794 --> 00:42:40.762
the England squad set
off to the 2006 World Cup

981
00:42:40.797 --> 00:42:42.159
with high hopes.

982
00:42:44.196 --> 00:42:46.262
- [Reporter] This airline's
used to flying the flag.

983
00:42:46.297 --> 00:42:49.936
but today that job fell to
its most famous passenger.

984
00:42:49.971 --> 00:42:51.531
Lots of luck. David.

985
00:42:51.566 --> 00:42:52.675
But get back to your seat.

986
00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:55.678
The other captain
wants to get moving.

987
00:42:55.713 --> 00:42:58.274
(fans chanting)

988
00:43:05.052 --> 00:43:08.856
- [Reporter] Mr. D.
Beckham. Mr. S. G. Eriksson.

989
00:43:08.891 --> 00:43:11.353
and 22 of the most
talented footballers

990
00:43:11.388 --> 00:43:13.960
England has produced
for a generation.

991
00:43:16.558 --> 00:43:19.592
- [Narrator] However. despite
the squad's potential.

992
00:43:19.627 --> 00:43:22.430
unfortunately. the
spotlight wasn't on them.

993
00:43:22.465 --> 00:43:23.673
- And we'll block the question.

994
00:43:23.708 --> 00:43:24.740
- [Reporter] But Sven.
there are reports

995
00:43:24.775 --> 00:43:26.269
coming out of Sweden today

996
00:43:26.304 --> 00:43:28.777
suggesting you're going to
quit after the game tomorrow.

997
00:43:28.812 --> 00:43:30.845
Would you set the
record straight. please?

998
00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:32.605
- Nick.
- No.

999
00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:34.046
- Let's get on the game. please.

1000
00:43:34.081 --> 00:43:36.576
No questions apart from
the football match today.

1001
00:43:37.887 --> 00:43:39.447
- [Reporter] Launching
the FA's All Together Now

1002
00:43:39.482 --> 00:43:40.723
campaign today.

1003
00:43:40.758 --> 00:43:42.087
the England boss has
written the intro

1004
00:43:42.122 --> 00:43:44.925
to a government-sponsored
World Cup guidebook.

1005
00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:47.928
which tries to address the
problem of anti-German sentiment

1006
00:43:47.963 --> 00:43:49.798
among English fans.

1007
00:43:49.833 --> 00:43:53.065
- It's important that
we behave on the pitch

1008
00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:54.627
and off the pitch.

1009
00:43:54.662 --> 00:43:57.630
We want to make a good
public relation for England.

1010
00:43:57.665 --> 00:44:00.842
as a football team
and as a football fan.

1011
00:44:00.877 --> 00:44:02.041
- [Narrator] On top
of the uncertainty

1012
00:44:02.076 --> 00:44:03.911
around Sven-Goran Eriksson.

1013
00:44:03.946 --> 00:44:06.639
England fans were once
again being singled out

1014
00:44:06.674 --> 00:44:08.278
for their behavior abroad.

1015
00:44:10.788 --> 00:44:12.953
- Well. I know that
English people don't expect

1016
00:44:12.988 --> 00:44:15.087
that we have a good sense
of humor in Germany.

1017
00:44:15.122 --> 00:44:18.794
but I'm sure it's still
an issue of sport.

1018
00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:23.161
of fun. of making party
and they won't take it

1019
00:44:23.196 --> 00:44:25.031
for serious. I'm sure.

1020
00:44:25.066 --> 00:44:26.560
- [Reporter] What
you're seeing here.

1021
00:44:26.595 --> 00:44:28.936
you're seeing people who've
been drinking all day.

1022
00:44:28.971 --> 00:44:34.007
It's over 30 degrees here.
It's absolutely scorching hot.

1023
00:44:35.505 --> 00:44:36.878
And these people. both the
English and German fans.

1024
00:44:36.913 --> 00:44:38.979
have been drinking since nine
or 10 o'clock this morning.

1025
00:44:39.014 --> 00:44:41.047
And you will always
have this sort of

1026
00:44:42.743 --> 00:44:46.514
baiting and taunting and
teasing of the opposition fans.

1027
00:44:46.549 --> 00:44:49.154
(fans shouting)

1028
00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:54.357
- [Reporter] Do you
think that references

1029
00:44:54.392 --> 00:44:57.690
to Germany's Nazi past.

1030
00:44:57.725 --> 00:45:00.968
to the Second World War
will cause offense now

1031
00:45:01.003 --> 00:45:02.266
to German fans?

1032
00:45:02.301 --> 00:45:04.268
- It might be offensive
for some of the people.

1033
00:45:04.303 --> 00:45:06.600
Mostly elderly people. I think.

1034
00:45:06.635 --> 00:45:10.604
- There were two German
bombers in the air.

1035
00:45:10.639 --> 00:45:12.507
there were two German
bombers in the air.

1036
00:45:12.542 --> 00:45:14.641
- [Reporter] The British
police told them not to do it.

1037
00:45:14.676 --> 00:45:16.082
as did the German police.

1038
00:45:16.117 --> 00:45:19.448
The FA pleaded with them as
well. but by mid-afternoon.

1039
00:45:19.483 --> 00:45:22.154
10 German bombers
had made its debut.

1040
00:45:22.189 --> 00:45:25.058
Inflatable Spitfires
were also on view.

1041
00:45:25.093 --> 00:45:27.159
The city hall came
under sustained attack

1042
00:45:27.194 --> 00:45:29.898
from fans punting
footballs at the windows.

1043
00:45:29.933 --> 00:45:31.427
but police did nothing about it.

1044
00:45:31.462 --> 00:45:34.001
So we went to see what the
mayor's office made of it all.

1045
00:45:34.036 --> 00:45:37.939
- [Reporter] They were aiming
footballs at the windows

1046
00:45:37.974 --> 00:45:39.072
of the city hall.

1047
00:45:39.107 --> 00:45:40.876
I mean. it's not
very respectful.

1048
00:45:42.011 --> 00:45:44.044
- My colleague
throw the ball back

1049
00:45:44.079 --> 00:45:46.915
so that they can play
down on the ground again.

1050
00:45:49.513 --> 00:45:51.249
- [Narrator] England's
first footballing challenge

1051
00:45:51.284 --> 00:45:54.582
came in the quarter finals
against a prime Portugal team.

1052
00:45:55.783 --> 00:45:57.057
- Everything has to
be right tomorrow.

1053
00:45:57.092 --> 00:45:59.125
In other way. it's difficult.

1054
00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:02.029
because Portugal has
a fantastic team.

1055
00:46:02.064 --> 00:46:05.934
We know that. and
individual skill.

1056
00:46:05.969 --> 00:46:07.100
good organized.

1057
00:46:08.598 --> 00:46:11.973
It's a very good team.
good pace. good technique.

1058
00:46:12.008 --> 00:46:13.007
So everything has to be right.

1059
00:46:13.042 --> 00:46:15.636
you have to keep
the ball attacking.

1060
00:46:15.671 --> 00:46:17.044
You have to defend well.

1061
00:46:17.079 --> 00:46:21.345
In other way. you don't win
quarterfinals. in a World Cup.

1062
00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:22.885
- [Reporter] Convinced
this time the curse

1063
00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:25.316
of the quarterfinal
would be broken.

1064
00:46:25.351 --> 00:46:28.187
But it was the curse of the
red card that struck first.

1065
00:46:29.993 --> 00:46:32.488
Fury and despair
in equal measure.

1066
00:46:32.523 --> 00:46:33.995
as Rooney trudges off.

1067
00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:39.033
England's fighting
efforts with 10 men

1068
00:46:39.068 --> 00:46:41.497
so reminiscent of
Argentina eight years ago.

1069
00:46:45.305 --> 00:46:46.876
By the end. the crowd were glad

1070
00:46:46.911 --> 00:46:48.438
to have hung on for penalties.

1071
00:46:48.473 --> 00:46:50.176
though all but the
youngest perhaps

1072
00:46:50.211 --> 00:46:52.211
should have known better.

1073
00:46:52.246 --> 00:46:54.510
Hargreaves briefly had them
believing that this time

1074
00:46:54.545 --> 00:46:55.577
it will be different.

1075
00:46:56.778 --> 00:46:59.922
But for Lampard and
then Gerrard to miss.

1076
00:46:59.957 --> 00:47:01.220
the nightmare was recurring.

1077
00:47:04.159 --> 00:47:07.127
No matter how many times
England fans go through this.

1078
00:47:07.162 --> 00:47:09.096
it doesn't get any easier.

1079
00:47:09.131 --> 00:47:12.000
- And I'm sorry for the team.

1080
00:47:13.498 --> 00:47:15.069
I'm sorry for the squad.

1081
00:47:15.104 --> 00:47:16.466
I'm sorry for the fans.

1082
00:47:16.501 --> 00:47:18.501
Really sorry. because I think.

1083
00:47:19.944 --> 00:47:21.405
with all the fans
we have out there.

1084
00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:25.673
they deserve to have a
team in the semifinal

1085
00:47:25.708 --> 00:47:27.081
or in the final.

1086
00:47:27.116 --> 00:47:29.875
- He'll tell you all about it.
He'll tell you all about it.

1087
00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:30.953
What it means.

1088
00:47:30.988 --> 00:47:33.087
- I don't know what
it is about penalties.

1089
00:47:33.122 --> 00:47:35.848
I don't know what it is about
having players sent off.

1090
00:47:35.883 --> 00:47:37.751
Just seems to happen
every time to us.

1091
00:47:38.919 --> 00:47:40.754
(melancholy music)

1092
00:47:40.789 --> 00:47:42.624
- [Narrator] England team
went on to lose the match

1093
00:47:42.659 --> 00:47:44.098
on penalties.

1094
00:47:44.133 --> 00:47:47.134
The next day. Beckham faced
the press in an interview

1095
00:47:47.169 --> 00:47:49.400
that shocked the world.

1096
00:47:49.435 --> 00:47:52.667
- If you bear with me. because
I wrote this late last night.

1097
00:47:55.441 --> 00:47:58.574
On November 15th. 2000.

1098
00:47:58.609 --> 00:48:01.610
Peter Taylor gave me the
greatest honor of my career.

1099
00:48:01.645 --> 00:48:03.117
in making me captain of England.

1100
00:48:03.152 --> 00:48:05.680
and fulfilling my
childhood dream.

1101
00:48:06.716 --> 00:48:08.848
Now almost six years later.

1102
00:48:08.883 --> 00:48:12.093
having been captain
for 58 of my 95 caps.

1103
00:48:12.128 --> 00:48:15.063
I feel the time is right
to pass on the armband.

1104
00:48:16.066 --> 00:48:19.496
as we enter in a new era
under Steve McClaren.

1105
00:48:19.531 --> 00:48:22.829
This decision has been
the most difficult

1106
00:48:22.864 --> 00:48:24.237
of my career to date.

1107
00:48:25.438 --> 00:48:27.570
but after discussing
it with my family

1108
00:48:27.605 --> 00:48:31.574
and the closest to me. I
feel the time is right.

1109
00:48:31.609 --> 00:48:33.950
- I spoke with
David last Monday.

1110
00:48:34.843 --> 00:48:36.711
notified him of my decision.

1111
00:48:36.746 --> 00:48:39.747
and said that I was
planning for the future.

1112
00:48:39.782 --> 00:48:42.057
looking to change things.

1113
00:48:42.092 --> 00:48:44.554
looking to go in a
different direction.

1114
00:48:45.722 --> 00:48:48.195
and David wasn't included.

1115
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:50.890
- [Reporter] The way perhaps
he's feeling right now?

1116
00:48:50.925 --> 00:48:54.069
- [Steve] I think any
questions on David Beckham

1117
00:48:54.104 --> 00:48:57.072
is rather unfair
on the new captain.

1118
00:48:59.373 --> 00:49:02.176
- [Narrator] As the English
squad changed its structure.

1119
00:49:02.211 --> 00:49:04.013
so did Madrid.

1120
00:49:04.048 --> 00:49:07.874
Ramon Calderon became
the new Real president.

1121
00:49:07.909 --> 00:49:09.513
keeping none of
the club officials

1122
00:49:09.548 --> 00:49:11.416
who served under the
previous president.

1123
00:49:11.451 --> 00:49:14.551
including head coach Lopez Caro.

1124
00:49:14.586 --> 00:49:16.784
Having proved himself
to the previous manager.

1125
00:49:16.819 --> 00:49:20.953
Beckham had to do it all
again. when in July. 2006.

1126
00:49:20.988 --> 00:49:24.792
Fabio Capello was appointed
as new Madrid manager.

1127
00:49:24.827 --> 00:49:27.201
Much like the 2002-3 season.

1128
00:49:27.236 --> 00:49:29.929
Beckham failed to regain
his place in the squad.

1129
00:49:29.964 --> 00:49:32.668
as the speedier
Jose Antonio Reyes

1130
00:49:32.703 --> 00:49:35.077
was normally preferred
on the right wing.

1131
00:49:35.112 --> 00:49:37.277
and fans didn't
feel any different.

1132
00:49:37.312 --> 00:49:39.642
- [Man] Definitely he has
been a very important player

1133
00:49:39.677 --> 00:49:42.150
for merchandising.
for publicity.

1134
00:49:42.185 --> 00:49:46.286
for the economy of
the club. it's true.

1135
00:49:46.321 --> 00:49:50.719
But the fans are
looking to the pitch.

1136
00:49:50.754 --> 00:49:54.591
and they're not looking to
the merchandising. you know?

1137
00:49:54.626 --> 00:49:58.331
And he has not been. I think.

1138
00:49:59.631 --> 00:50:03.336
a player that make the
difference in the team.

1139
00:50:03.371 --> 00:50:06.900
- You know. I've joined a
club that is a massive club.

1140
00:50:08.035 --> 00:50:10.706
If I was going to
leave Manchester United

1141
00:50:10.741 --> 00:50:14.875
at any time in my career.
then to join a massive club.

1142
00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:17.350
like Real Madrid is a dream.

1143
00:50:19.651 --> 00:50:21.156
- [Narrator] Beckham was now

1144
00:50:21.191 --> 00:50:24.016
the most globally recognized
footballer in the world.

1145
00:50:29.199 --> 00:50:32.794
Amassing fanbases in
Europe. Asia. and Africa.

1146
00:50:32.829 --> 00:50:34.169
- [Reporter] There's
little dispute in Japan

1147
00:50:34.204 --> 00:50:37.931
over just who is the world's
greatest football star.

1148
00:50:37.966 --> 00:50:39.306
- David Beckham.

1149
00:50:41.277 --> 00:50:42.441
- David Beckham.
- David Beckham.

1150
00:50:42.476 --> 00:50:43.838
- David Beckham.

1151
00:50:45.512 --> 00:50:47.281
- [Reporter] What
about the hair?

1152
00:50:47.316 --> 00:50:49.415
- My favorite thing in
the world is soccer.

1153
00:50:49.450 --> 00:50:52.484
- To play soccer.
like David Beckham.

1154
00:50:54.422 --> 00:50:56.686
- [Narrator] However.
there was one market

1155
00:50:56.721 --> 00:50:58.226
still left to crack.

1156
00:50:59.229 --> 00:51:01.295
- [Man] Just a moment.

1157
00:51:01.330 --> 00:51:03.231
At this time. I'd like to
introduce Los Angeles Galaxy

1158
00:51:03.266 --> 00:51:05.332
midfielder. David Beckham.

1159
00:51:05.367 --> 00:51:07.862
(upbeat music)

1160
00:51:10.966 --> 00:51:12.240
- [Bush] There's no
doubt in my mind.

1161
00:51:12.275 --> 00:51:13.373
No doubt in my mind.

1162
00:51:13.408 --> 00:51:14.836
We'll bring Al Qaeda to justice.

1163
00:51:14.871 --> 00:51:16.673
peace or no peace
in the Middle East.

1164
00:51:38.268 --> 00:51:40.334
- [Reporter] On this stretch
of the US Mexico border.

1165
00:51:40.369 --> 00:51:42.930
there is already a
physical barrier.

1166
00:51:42.965 --> 00:51:46.175
Miles of fence.
reinforcing miles of wall.

1167
00:51:51.314 --> 00:51:52.280
- Good afternoon.

1168
00:51:53.844 --> 00:51:56.251
I'm honored to be
here in a great city.

1169
00:51:56.286 --> 00:51:59.452
one of my most favorite
cities in the world.

1170
00:51:59.487 --> 00:52:01.047
Not just saying that
because I'm here.

1171
00:52:01.082 --> 00:52:03.852
and I have to say that.
but I really believe that.

1172
00:52:03.887 --> 00:52:07.592
and I'm honored to be
here as a Galaxy player.

1173
00:52:07.627 --> 00:52:10.364
- If he had asked my advice
about leaving Real Madrid

1174
00:52:10.399 --> 00:52:11.629
to go to LA Galaxy.

1175
00:52:11.664 --> 00:52:14.830
I would have told him
exactly what I thought.

1176
00:52:14.865 --> 00:52:17.635
How can you leave Real
Madrid to go to LA Galaxy?

1177
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:18.471
You know?

1178
00:52:20.937 --> 00:52:23.168

the hostile hooligan culture

1179
00:52:23.203 --> 00:52:24.510
of European football.

1180
00:52:24.545 --> 00:52:27.777
the MLS has a more family
friendly atmosphere.

1181
00:52:28.978 --> 00:52:31.583
- We are Sounders.
mighty Sounders.

1182

DC United.

1187
00:52:53.607 --> 00:52:57.840

Ryan Roe. And the captain.

1188
00:53:05.553 --> 00:53:07.949
- [Narrator] With Beckham
seemingly set by the wayside

1189
00:53:07.984 --> 00:53:09.390
by European football.

1190
00:53:09.425 --> 00:53:11.953
he set himself the goal of
increasing the popularity

1191
00:53:11.988 --> 00:53:13.625
of the MLS.

1192
00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:17.926
- I want to achieve something
that is definitely possible.

1193
00:53:17.961 --> 00:53:22.964
within the fact of raising
the profile of the MLS.

1194
00:53:24.165 --> 00:53:27.166
raising the profile
of soccer as a sport.

1195
00:53:27.201 --> 00:53:30.378
You know. I'm not silly
enough to sit up here

1196
00:53:30.413 --> 00:53:32.446
and say that it's going to
be bigger than baseball.

1197
00:53:32.481 --> 00:53:35.240
basketball. American football.
and ice hockey. you know?

1198
00:53:35.275 --> 00:53:37.946
Because I'm never going
to say it is going to be.

1199
00:53:37.981 --> 00:53:40.718
But the decision to join
the Galaxy wasn't hard.

1200
00:53:40.753 --> 00:53:42.654
because I've been to LA.

1201
00:53:42.689 --> 00:53:45.987
I've met the owners
of the Galaxy.

1202
00:53:46.022 --> 00:53:48.528
I've become friends of
the owners of the Galaxy.

1203
00:53:49.861 --> 00:53:52.400
And I think there's a huge
opportunity out there.

1204
00:53:52.435 --> 00:53:55.601
And as Tim said. I
think that with me.

1205
00:53:55.636 --> 00:53:56.734
it's about the football.

1206
00:53:56.769 --> 00:53:58.340
That's what I'm all about.

1207
00:53:58.375 --> 00:53:59.737
I'm coming there to
make a difference.

1208
00:53:59.772 --> 00:54:01.475
I'm coming there
to play football.

1209
00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:04.313
And that's the
biggest thing for me.

1210
00:54:04.348 --> 00:54:06.007
- [Narrator] With
their new star man.

1211
00:54:06.042 --> 00:54:08.141
LA Galaxy were able to pull off

1212
00:54:08.176 --> 00:54:11.012
a new five-year shirt
sponsorship deal

1213
00:54:11.047 --> 00:54:13.850
worth $20 million US.

1214
00:54:13.885 --> 00:54:17.282
as well as 11.000 new
season tickets holders.

1215
00:54:17.317 --> 00:54:19.790
and sold out luxury suites.

1216
00:54:19.825 --> 00:54:24.025
However. after five seasons
and two MLS cup titles.

1217
00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:26.566
there was still
something missing:

1218
00:54:26.601 --> 00:54:28.799
the coveted FIFA World Cup.

1219
00:54:32.376 --> 00:54:35.806
With Becks' sights firmly
set on another World Cup run.

1220
00:54:35.841 --> 00:54:37.478
big changes were needed.

1221
00:54:38.712 --> 00:54:41.416
- Playing international
football and regular football.

1222
00:54:41.451 --> 00:54:43.484
you know. at the highest level.

1223
00:54:43.519 --> 00:54:46.421
I think he's got to be a
playing at a different level

1224
00:54:46.456 --> 00:54:49.281
to what he would do in the
States to have any chance.

1225
00:54:49.316 --> 00:54:51.052
- [Reporter] Has Fabio
Capello talked to you

1226
00:54:51.087 --> 00:54:53.758
about the importance
of staying in Milan?

1227
00:54:53.793 --> 00:54:55.397
- No. it's not at all.

1228
00:54:55.432 --> 00:54:58.092
It's just something that.
when I first was thinking

1229
00:54:58.127 --> 00:54:59.159
about going on loan.

1230
00:54:59.194 --> 00:55:01.260
obviously I asked his advice.

1231
00:55:03.297 --> 00:55:07.200
his experience on where I should
go and where I should play.

1232
00:55:07.235 --> 00:55:08.036
And he said.

1233
00:55:09.512 --> 00:55:11.611
"All I can say to you is
play at the highest level."

1234
00:55:12.548 --> 00:55:13.745
And obviously. I
hope I'm doing that.

1235
00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:14.680
I think I'm doing that.

1236
00:55:14.715 --> 00:55:16.517
- [Narrator] In July. 2009.

1237
00:55:16.552 --> 00:55:19.080
in hopes of keeping his
World Cup dream alive.

1238
00:55:19.115 --> 00:55:21.951
Beckham made a shock
move to AC Milan

1239
00:55:21.986 --> 00:55:25.119
in an effort to get back
into top tier football.

1240
00:55:25.154 --> 00:55:26.692
- After being an AC Milan now.

1241
00:55:26.727 --> 00:55:29.761
it gives me more of a chance
to be at that higher level.

1242
00:55:29.796 --> 00:55:31.565
to play at international level.

1243
00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:33.831
which is always important.

1244
00:55:33.866 --> 00:55:36.405
But we'll see. we'll see.

1245
00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:38.539
I'm enjoying being with
the squad at the moment.

1246
00:55:38.574 --> 00:55:41.102
And hopefully. it continues.

1247
00:55:41.137 --> 00:55:43.104
- Becks is a fantastic
footballer. Everyone knows that.

1248
00:55:43.139 --> 00:55:46.305
His capabilities as a player.

1249
00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:47.614
It's just about him being fit.

1250
00:55:47.649 --> 00:55:49.011
I think the managers said.

1251
00:55:49.046 --> 00:55:51.651
If I'm right. in seeing
what is said in the media.

1252
00:55:51.686 --> 00:55:53.686
And he looks to be
doing that now at Milan.

1253
00:55:53.721 --> 00:55:54.918
He looks very happy.

1254
00:55:54.953 --> 00:55:56.183
He looks like he's
enjoying his football.

1255
00:55:56.218 --> 00:55:57.591
Alex has asked about him.

1256
00:55:57.626 --> 00:55:59.923
and speaking to him
since he's been there.

1257
00:55:59.958 --> 00:56:01.529
he seems like he's having
the time of his life.

1258
00:56:01.564 --> 00:56:04.895
So. his quality's undoubted.
and he's a great member

1259
00:56:04.930 --> 00:56:06.193
of the squad.

1260
00:56:06.228 --> 00:56:07.535
- [Reporter] Just how much
has that move to Milan

1261
00:56:07.570 --> 00:56:09.295
improved your
game. do you think?

1262
00:56:10.573 --> 00:56:13.398
- I think it's improved my
fitness more than anything else.

1263
00:56:13.433 --> 00:56:18.172
because I said. when I
first arrived in Dubai.

1264
00:56:18.207 --> 00:56:21.681
with Milan. my
body fat was 13.7.

1265
00:56:21.716 --> 00:56:23.914
and now it's 8.5. I think.

1266
00:56:23.949 --> 00:56:26.686
So you know. I think it was
more about the fitness side

1267
00:56:26.721 --> 00:56:27.720
than anything else.

1268
00:56:27.755 --> 00:56:28.985
- And also. I think
towards the end.

1269
00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:31.955
he probably did miss
the big time football.

1270
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:33.990
That's a decision
he made himself.

1271
00:56:34.025 --> 00:56:36.322
Maybe in years to come.
he'll look back and say.

1272
00:56:36.357 --> 00:56:38.500
"Well. maybe I should
have stayed Real Madrid."

1273
00:56:38.535 --> 00:56:40.062
Whatever.

1274
00:56:40.097 --> 00:56:42.229
- [Reporter] Are
talking to the MLS.

1275
00:56:42.264 --> 00:56:43.637
but we understand that Milan

1276
00:56:43.672 --> 00:56:45.606
are talking to the
MLS and the Galaxy.

1277
00:56:45.641 --> 00:56:47.168
Is that correct?

1278
00:56:47.203 --> 00:56:48.807
- I would think so by
now they are. yeah.

1279
00:56:48.842 --> 00:56:51.106
Because both clubs
know my feeling

1280
00:56:51.141 --> 00:56:53.647
on staying here in Milan now.

1281
00:56:53.682 --> 00:56:55.880
And it's out of my hands now.

1282
00:56:55.915 --> 00:56:58.553
It's down to
obviously both teams.

1283
00:56:58.588 --> 00:57:00.555
- I mean. he's not
getting any younger.

1284
00:57:00.590 --> 00:57:03.283
I mean. there's a lot of
competition around these days.

1285
00:57:03.318 --> 00:57:05.318
- [Reporter] Fabio Capello
has told English TV

1286
00:57:05.353 --> 00:57:08.288
that he thinks David Beckham's
probably too old now.

1287
00:57:08.323 --> 00:57:09.630
If that is the case.

1288
00:57:09.665 --> 00:57:11.390
how do you think David
Beckham will be remembered

1289
00:57:11.425 --> 00:57:12.633
as an England player?

1290
00:57:12.668 --> 00:57:14.767
- Legendary status.
without a doubt.

1291
00:57:14.802 --> 00:57:17.737
I think he's put a long shift
in as an England player.

1292
00:57:17.772 --> 00:57:20.773
some fantastic performances.
some fantastic goals. memories.

1293
00:57:20.808 --> 00:57:23.105
And you know. he was
a fantastic captain.

1294
00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:24.403
I've learnt a lot off David.

1295
00:57:24.438 --> 00:57:28.550
and it's been a pleasure
to play alongside him.

1296
00:57:28.585 --> 00:57:29.683
If he has played his last game.

1297
00:57:29.718 --> 00:57:31.245
he'd certainly be missed.

1298
00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:33.280
because both on and off the
pitch. he's a great guy.

1299
00:57:33.315 --> 00:57:34.446
- [Reporter] He's
the sort of player

1300
00:57:34.481 --> 00:57:35.557
who's proved everybody
wrong before.

1301
00:57:35.592 --> 00:57:36.987
when people have written him off

1302
00:57:37.022 --> 00:57:39.484
at club and international
level. so you never know.

1303
00:57:39.519 --> 00:57:41.222
- [Steven] Yeah. you
never know with David.

1304
00:57:41.257 --> 00:57:43.763
- Fabio Capella has got
to look to the World Cup.

1305
00:57:43.798 --> 00:57:46.601
and it remains to be seen
how he sees David's role.

1306
00:57:46.636 --> 00:57:50.231
whether he sees him
as a permanent member
of his first team.

1307
00:57:50.266 --> 00:57:52.640
or whether he sees
him as a squad player.

1308
00:57:52.675 --> 00:57:55.907
and is going to use him
in a substitute capacity.

1309
00:57:55.942 --> 00:57:57.469
- [Reporter] There's
been a lot of debate

1310
00:57:57.504 --> 00:57:58.910
about the future of David
Beckham in the England setup.

1311
00:57:58.945 --> 00:58:03.684
If he plays in February.
it will be his 100th cap.

1312
00:58:03.719 --> 00:58:05.752
He's also said he
wants to play on

1313
00:58:05.787 --> 00:58:08.084
through to the next World Cup.

1314
00:58:08.119 --> 00:58:10.350
Is he guaranteed to
get his 100th cap.

1315
00:58:10.385 --> 00:58:12.451
and do you see them
going forward to play

1316
00:58:12.486 --> 00:58:14.695
as long as the next World Cup?

1317
00:58:14.730 --> 00:58:18.193
(Fabio speaking Spanish)

1318
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.802
- [Translator] We have a
contrasting relationship

1319
00:58:22.837 --> 00:58:24.738
with David Beckham
at Real Madrid.

1320
00:58:24.773 --> 00:58:27.840
but in the end. he actually
demonstrated to be a great man

1321
00:58:27.875 --> 00:58:29.006
and a great player.

1322
00:58:30.471 --> 00:58:33.681
He's also the kind of
person who believes.

1323
00:58:33.716 --> 00:58:36.541
when he sets himself
something. he will achieve it.

1324
00:58:36.576 --> 00:58:38.686
And so. you never know.

1325
00:58:38.721 --> 00:58:42.283
but obviously Mr. Capello
will have to make choices.

1326
00:58:43.583 --> 00:58:44.857
He believes that basically.

1327
00:58:44.892 --> 00:58:46.353
David's behavior is important.

1328
00:58:48.126 --> 00:58:50.896
However. there is obviously
still over a month

1329
00:58:50.931 --> 00:58:52.425
until the first game.

1330
00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:53.767
so there's plenty of time
for these important decisions

1331
00:58:53.802 --> 00:58:54.636
to be made.

1332
00:58:57.036 --> 00:58:59.773
- There's only
one David Beckham.

1333
00:58:59.808 --> 00:59:02.303
There's only one David Beckham.

1334
00:59:02.338 --> 00:59:03.909
- [Reporter] Welcome to Paris.

1335
00:59:03.944 --> 00:59:06.780
and the David
Beckham tribute show.

1336
00:59:06.815 --> 00:59:08.045
- For what he's
done for his country

1337
00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:11.081
over the past 10
years. he's fantastic.

1338
00:59:11.116 --> 00:59:12.720
- I hope he does
a good reception.

1339
00:59:12.755 --> 00:59:14.315
I expect it for him.

1340
00:59:14.350 --> 00:59:16.922
- In my opinion. it's
all about Beckham.

1341
00:59:16.957 --> 00:59:18.484
100th cap. he deserves it.

1342
00:59:18.519 --> 00:59:21.553
- [Narrator] Beckham soon
earned his 100th England cap.

1343
00:59:21.588 --> 00:59:25.634
presented to him by none
other than Sir Bobby Charlton.

1344
00:59:25.669 --> 00:59:29.462
However. his World Cup
future was still uncertain.

1345
00:59:29.497 --> 00:59:31.838
- [Reporter] When Fabio
Capello swept into Soho Square.

1346
00:59:31.873 --> 00:59:34.500
he made it clear he had little
time for sentimentality.

1347
00:59:34.535 --> 00:59:37.239
saying players would be
picked on form and fitness.

1348
00:59:37.274 --> 00:59:38.812
not star status.

1349
00:59:38.847 --> 00:59:41.210
If David Beckham steps
out on this pitch

1350
00:59:41.245 --> 00:59:42.816
in the country he
once called home.

1351
00:59:42.851 --> 00:59:44.752
he'll equal a record
that will see him

1352
00:59:44.787 --> 00:59:46.721
further propelled into
the history books.

1353
00:59:46.756 --> 00:59:49.482
ensuring that although he
wants to leave the Galaxy.

1354
00:59:49.517 --> 00:59:51.517
his star will keep on rising.

1355
00:59:53.488 --> 00:59:54.762
- [Reporter] He wants
to start on Wednesday.

1356
00:59:54.797 --> 00:59:56.929
Would be his 100th
start for England.

1357
00:59:56.964 --> 00:59:58.392
and obviously his 108th cap.

1358
00:59:58.427 --> 00:59:59.558
He's got it (indistinct).

1359
01:00:01.903 --> 01:00:04.640
What sort of achievement
is that. do you think?

1360
01:00:06.006 --> 01:00:08.039
- Just to get to 100's an
unbelievable achievement.

1361
01:00:08.074 --> 01:00:11.812
but then to equal a man of
the stature of Bobby Moore

1362
01:00:11.847 --> 01:00:12.846
is just phenomenal.

1363
01:00:12.881 --> 01:00:15.145
and I'm sure Becks
in his wildest dreams

1364
01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:16.542
would never imagine
that as a kid.

1365
01:00:16.577 --> 01:00:18.280
putting on his boots.
when he was a seven.

1366
01:00:18.315 --> 01:00:19.820
eight year old. I'm sure.

1367
01:00:19.855 --> 01:00:21.580
- [Reporter] The headlines
tomorrow may well be about race.

1368
01:00:21.615 --> 01:00:25.188
but Beckham will be hoping
it's his race to glory instead.

1369
01:00:25.223 --> 01:00:27.421
His rejuvenation at
AC Milan has seen him

1370
01:00:27.456 --> 01:00:29.764
brought back into the
England team on merit.

1371
01:00:29.799 --> 01:00:31.557
and now all the talk
is about equaling

1372
01:00:31.592 --> 01:00:34.131
Bobby Moore's
record of 108 caps.

1373
01:00:34.166 --> 01:00:35.660
- [Reporter] We've talked
about Steven Gerrard.

1374
01:00:35.695 --> 01:00:36.804
We've talked about Wayne Rooney.

1375
01:00:36.839 --> 01:00:37.970
We haven't mentioned
David Beckham yet.

1376
01:00:38.005 --> 01:00:40.467
so do you want to get onto that?

1377
01:00:40.502 --> 01:00:44.977
- No. no. I think. you never
ask me about the Slovakia.

1378
01:00:45.012 --> 01:00:46.275
the Ukrainia.

1379
01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:48.948
Always Gerrard.
Rooney. Redknapp.

1380
01:00:52.712 --> 01:00:54.151
The others.

1381
01:00:54.186 --> 01:00:56.516
- [Reporter] Do you see
a fitter David Beckham?

1382
01:00:56.551 --> 01:01:01.422
A David Beckham that can
realistically go on to 2010 now?

1383
01:01:02.623 --> 01:01:05.426
- Yeah. Beckham is
in very good moment.

1384
01:01:05.461 --> 01:01:10.497
I watch it in TV. the last
two games that he played

1385
01:01:11.775 --> 01:01:13.973
with AC Milan. is a
good moment of form.

1386
01:01:14.008 --> 01:01:16.404
He play always the first 11.

1387
01:01:16.439 --> 01:01:21.442
and I check him here
during the training.

1388
01:01:22.643 --> 01:01:24.280
It's a very. very
good moment for him.

1389
01:01:25.481 --> 01:01:26.953
- I mean. anybody
gets over 100 caps.

1390
01:01:26.988 --> 01:01:28.119
especially an outfield player.

1391
01:01:28.154 --> 01:01:30.055
it's a fantastic achievement.

1392
01:01:30.090 --> 01:01:31.089
and at one point we didn't think

1393
01:01:31.124 --> 01:01:32.893
David was going to get 100.

1394
01:01:34.028 --> 01:01:35.995
having been left
out by McClaren.

1395
01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:37.722
and then going to the States.

1396
01:01:37.757 --> 01:01:39.966
- [Reporter] You've lost
Lowe and Hargreaves.

1397
01:01:40.001 --> 01:01:42.298
Still no David Beckham. Why?

1398
01:01:43.807 --> 01:01:47.171
- I feel that we've got other
players that can come in.

1399
01:01:47.206 --> 01:01:50.207
and can do the job. and looking
to the future to do that.

1400
01:01:50.242 --> 01:01:53.045
- He's rejuvenated. really.

1401
01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:55.916
since Fabio Capello's brought
him back into the squad.

1402
01:01:57.645 --> 01:01:58.380
and obviously.

1403
01:01:59.889 --> 01:02:01.856
it looks as though it's going
to get to that landmark.

1404
01:02:01.891 --> 01:02:02.923
- [Reporter] David.
last time was obviously

1405
01:02:02.958 --> 01:02:04.518
all about equaling Bobby Moore.

1406
01:02:04.553 --> 01:02:05.860
This time. it's about becoming

1407
01:02:05.895 --> 01:02:08.588
the most capped outfield
player ever for England.

1408
01:02:08.623 --> 01:02:11.756
Can you even fathom
what that means?

1409
01:02:11.791 --> 01:02:12.900
- [Reporter] No.

1410
01:02:12.935 --> 01:02:14.363
You know. every time I
meet up with England.

1411
01:02:14.398 --> 01:02:16.035
obviously it's a huge honor.

1412
01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:17.938
Every player feels like
that when they meet up

1413
01:02:17.973 --> 01:02:19.940
with the squad. but you know.

1414
01:02:19.975 --> 01:02:23.009
to be on the amount of caps
and the games that I am

1415
01:02:23.044 --> 01:02:25.847
at the moment. it was a great
honor for me. of course.

1416
01:02:25.882 --> 01:02:29.279
But I think that every time

1417
01:02:29.314 --> 01:02:32.645
that I personally
meet up with the team.

1418
01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:33.855
it's a bonus.

1419
01:02:33.890 --> 01:02:38.651
because being on
probably 94. 95 caps.

1420
01:02:38.686 --> 01:02:40.092
I never expected to make 100.

1421
01:02:40.127 --> 01:02:42.094
and then obviously making 100.

1422
01:02:42.129 --> 01:02:43.788
people expected
me to retire them.

1423
01:02:43.823 --> 01:02:48.837
So. to be on 108 now.
and hopefully get 109.

1424
01:02:49.796 --> 01:02:51.169
I'm happy with that.

1425
01:02:51.204 --> 01:02:52.665
- Yeah. I mean. I think
he's had a lot of challenges

1426
01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:53.842
all through his career.

1427
01:02:55.208 --> 01:02:58.044
He seems to have come through
them all with flying colors.

1428
01:02:58.079 --> 01:02:59.914
People said he was finished
a couple of years ago.

1429
01:02:59.949 --> 01:03:01.410
He's come back. and
he's an integral member

1430
01:03:01.445 --> 01:03:02.609
of the squad still.

1431
01:03:02.644 --> 01:03:04.611
So. Becks is a
fantastic footballer.

1432
01:03:04.646 --> 01:03:06.514
Everyone knows it. his
capabilities as a player.

1433
01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:08.780
- [John] I think as a
player. playing with Becks.

1434
01:03:08.815 --> 01:03:10.089
and training with him.

1435
01:03:10.124 --> 01:03:12.289
and realize how much
this means to him.

1436
01:03:13.721 --> 01:03:15.556
I think it's easy for
people to shoot people down

1437
01:03:15.591 --> 01:03:16.997
when they're at the very top.

1438
01:03:17.032 --> 01:03:19.626
And for many years. Becks has
been at the top and still is.

1439
01:03:19.661 --> 01:03:22.728
He's always been one of the
best players in the world.

1440
01:03:22.763 --> 01:03:24.598
I think it's easy for
people to try and kick him

1441
01:03:24.633 --> 01:03:27.238
and knock him down. but
they've not succeeded.

1442
01:03:28.241 --> 01:03:29.768
And he's one of the best.

1443
01:03:29.803 --> 01:03:31.572
and that's why he's up there
and still in the England squad.

1444
01:03:31.607 --> 01:03:36.577
- [David] I want to
have a chance of being
involved in 2010.

1445
01:03:37.118 --> 01:03:39.052
And I believe. obviously.
my best chance of doing that

1446
01:03:39.087 --> 01:03:41.054
would be by staying here.

1447
01:03:41.089 --> 01:03:44.090
But you know. like I said.
it's out of my hands now.

1448
01:03:45.225 --> 01:03:48.127
I hope it can be
sorted. but we'll see.

1449
01:03:48.162 --> 01:03:50.899
- [Reporter] The woes of
Rustenburg have been forgotten

1450
01:03:50.934 --> 01:03:52.032
in Cape Town.

1451
01:03:52.067 --> 01:03:54.364
This is now considered
the real start

1452
01:03:54.399 --> 01:03:57.004
of England's World Cup campaign.

1453
01:03:57.039 --> 01:03:59.633
The turnout has
even impressed FIFA.

1454
01:03:59.668 --> 01:04:02.911
which is rapidly revising
its downbeat estimate

1455
01:04:02.946 --> 01:04:05.375
of how many foreign
fans would come.

1456
01:04:05.410 --> 01:04:08.015
- It seems that we are
on the way to 500.000

1457
01:04:08.050 --> 01:04:10.083
international visitors
coming to South Africa.

1458
01:04:10.118 --> 01:04:12.118
- [Reporter] So. more of a
success than you'd hoped for?

1459
01:04:12.153 --> 01:04:15.253
- I think more than
anyone has expected

1460
01:04:15.288 --> 01:04:17.255
from this World Cup. even us.

1461
01:04:17.290 --> 01:04:18.718
- [Reporter] But
England's definitely

1462
01:04:18.753 --> 01:04:20.687
winning the war for territory.

1463
01:04:20.722 --> 01:04:24.031
Cape Town is decked
out in red and white.

1464
01:04:24.066 --> 01:04:25.593
- You got to get there early.

1465
01:04:25.628 --> 01:04:27.100
We're flying anoraks. so
you got to get there early.

1466
01:04:27.135 --> 01:04:30.070
get the flag up. otherwise
you lose all the best spaces.

1467
01:04:31.502 --> 01:04:33.436
- [Reporter] The world's
biggest England shirt

1468
01:04:33.471 --> 01:04:34.976
has even made it here.

1469
01:04:35.011 --> 01:04:38.507
a sign of the huge
expectations that 2010

1470
01:04:38.542 --> 01:04:40.608
will live up to the past.

1471
01:04:40.643 --> 01:04:42.115
- We're at our best when
our backs are to the wall.

1472
01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:44.051
and I think the
lads will make sure

1473
01:04:44.086 --> 01:04:46.317
that they rub a few noses
in it after this one.

1474
01:04:46.352 --> 01:04:49.056
- [Reporter] They know
this is make or break time

1475
01:04:49.091 --> 01:04:51.685
for England. but they're
convinced the team

1476
01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:54.996
will light up the Cape
Town stadium tonight.

1477
01:04:57.726 --> 01:05:00.133
(tense music)

1478
01:05:16.976 --> 01:05:19.416
- [Narrator] On the
14th of March. 2010.

1479
01:05:19.451 --> 01:05:22.089
Beckham's dreams at a World
Cup comeback were shattered

1480
01:05:22.124 --> 01:05:24.718
after he suffered a torn
left Achilles tendon.

1481
01:05:24.753 --> 01:05:27.127
playing against the
Kievo in Serie A.

1482
01:05:28.592 --> 01:05:31.593
Unbeknownst to him. Beckham
had played his last game

1483
01:05:31.628 --> 01:05:33.892
in the famous
three lions Jersey.

1484
01:05:33.927 --> 01:05:35.366
- I know the country
is in mourning.

1485
01:05:35.401 --> 01:05:37.731
I think mainly because
everyone admires David Beckham

1486
01:05:37.766 --> 01:05:40.239
as a person. and for what he's
done for England in the past.

1487
01:05:40.274 --> 01:05:42.010
- You obviously need
the experienced players

1488
01:05:42.045 --> 01:05:44.210
to boost the younger players.

1489
01:05:44.245 --> 01:05:46.179
So missing out on David Beckham.

1490
01:05:46.214 --> 01:05:48.247
it would probably
be a bit of a shame.

1491
01:05:48.282 --> 01:05:51.118
- I'm so sorry for here for him.

1492
01:05:51.153 --> 01:05:56.156
because I know how
he wanted to go.

1493
01:05:58.391 --> 01:06:00.688
And the workup. he went.

1494
01:06:00.723 --> 01:06:05.660
He came last year in
Milan. above all for this.

1495
01:06:06.861 --> 01:06:10.434
to show his quality
for the England team.

1496
01:06:10.469 --> 01:06:12.238
I'm so sorry for this.

1497
01:06:12.273 --> 01:06:15.175
- [Narrator] After a brief
six month spell at PSG.

1498
01:06:15.210 --> 01:06:17.606
the day finally came
to hang up the boots.

1499
01:06:17.641 --> 01:06:20.004
and public opinion
was ever contrasting

1500
01:06:20.039 --> 01:06:21.412
to that of 1998.

1501
01:06:21.447 --> 01:06:23.447
- I think that was
right moment to stop.

1502
01:06:24.747 --> 01:06:26.351
You have to expect this.

1503
01:06:26.386 --> 01:06:30.322
Of course. not just PSG.

1504
01:06:30.357 --> 01:06:34.887
but the football world
lost a fantastic player.

1505
01:06:34.922 --> 01:06:39.925
Lost a fantastic professional
player. Lost a good man.

1506
01:06:41.170 --> 01:06:42.532
- Well. it's a sad day.

1507
01:06:42.567 --> 01:06:45.733
I can imagine that there are
many boys. men and women.

1508
01:06:45.768 --> 01:06:49.176
all over the world that
are mourning the loss

1509
01:06:49.211 --> 01:06:50.375
of a football star.

1510
01:06:50.410 --> 01:06:52.245
He's an absolute icon.

1511
01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:54.346
- Beckham was out
of order. basically.

1512
01:06:54.381 --> 01:06:55.446
He should have
stayed on the field.

1513
01:06:55.481 --> 01:06:57.250
and if he had have done.
we'd have got through.

1514
01:06:57.285 --> 01:07:00.121
- Professional footballer
committed to the cause.

1515
01:07:00.156 --> 01:07:01.782
loved the clubs
that he played for.

1516
01:07:03.016 --> 01:07:05.489
Today. footballers. you
know. you could question

1517
01:07:05.524 --> 01:07:06.952
some of their motivations.

1518
01:07:06.987 --> 01:07:09.361
You never had your
questions about him

1519
01:07:09.396 --> 01:07:10.890
and his motivations at all.

1520
01:07:10.925 --> 01:07:12.364
- To get sent off
in a match like that

1521
01:07:12.399 --> 01:07:14.333
is a disgrace to anybody.

1522
01:07:14.368 --> 01:07:15.466
I'm sorry for his career.

1523
01:07:18.471 --> 01:07:21.065
- Say. for football in England.

1524
01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:23.210
So he'll continue his
role as an ambassador.

1525
01:07:23.245 --> 01:07:25.410
I know he's in a lot of
work in the Far East.

1526
01:07:25.445 --> 01:07:28.479
in his training roles. you
know. for kids and stuff.

1527
01:07:28.514 --> 01:07:30.415
So he'll still be around.

1528
01:07:30.450 --> 01:07:32.516
He'll be around for a long
time. forever. you know?

1529
01:07:32.551 --> 01:07:35.090
Till he's well old. So
you never lose them.

1530
01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:38.951
(children shouting)

1531
01:07:46.466 --> 01:07:48.026
- [Alex] He's become fantastic.

1532
01:07:48.061 --> 01:07:51.062
How can I argue with how he's
turned out as a human being?

1533
01:07:51.097 --> 01:07:53.240
He's an icon to every
kid in the world.

1534
01:07:53.275 --> 01:07:55.176
he's a very wealthy guy.

1535
01:07:55.211 --> 01:07:57.112
So how can I possibly
argue with that?

1536
01:08:01.943 --> 01:08:05.153
- [Narrator] Amid the fame.
red carpets and brand deals.

1537
01:08:05.188 --> 01:08:07.584
Beckham pioneered
a fresh new look

1538
01:08:07.619 --> 01:08:10.356
of what a modern
day footballer is.

1539
01:08:11.887 --> 01:08:13.953
With the odds
stacked against him.

1540
01:08:13.988 --> 01:08:16.087
the young boy from
Leytonstone went on

1541
01:08:16.122 --> 01:08:18.430
to win a long list
of silverware.

1542
01:08:18.465 --> 01:08:21.400
including six PL
titles. two FA cups.

1543
01:08:21.435 --> 01:08:23.963
one La Liga. one
Champions League.

1544
01:08:23.998 --> 01:08:26.504
and one PFA Young
Player of the Year.

1545
01:08:28.409 --> 01:08:31.509
He conquered England.
Italy and America.

1546
01:08:31.544 --> 01:08:34.446
both commercially
and as an athlete.

1547
01:08:34.481 --> 01:08:38.043
became the third highest capped
English player of all time.

1548
01:08:38.078 --> 01:08:42.289
and smashed shirt sale records
at Madrid and LA Galaxy.

1549
01:08:42.324 --> 01:08:45.952
whilst also becoming the
highest paid player of all time.

1550
01:08:49.364 --> 01:08:51.529
There is no doubting
the financial success

1551
01:08:51.564 --> 01:08:52.860
of Beckham's career.

1552
01:08:56.503 --> 01:08:59.438
And when a player wins as
many trophies as Becks.

1553
01:08:59.473 --> 01:09:01.737
there's no doubting their
playing career either.

1554
01:09:03.477 --> 01:09:06.346
(gentle piano music)

1555
01:09:19.086 --> 01:09:19.986
- [Reporter] Back
home in England

1556
01:09:20.021 --> 01:09:21.691
as the excitement builds.

1557
01:09:21.726 --> 01:09:24.188
one 10-year-old by has
taken his love of the game

1558
01:09:24.223 --> 01:09:25.596
a little too far.

1559
01:09:25.631 --> 01:09:29.061
Tom Sylvester chose to
go bald before his years.

1560
01:09:29.096 --> 01:09:31.470
to look like his hero. Sven.

1561
01:09:31.505 --> 01:09:33.164
- There's quite a lot
of people in the school

1562
01:09:33.199 --> 01:09:34.374
who dress up as David Beckham.

1563
01:09:34.409 --> 01:09:37.135
and I thought Sven
would be different.

1564
01:09:38.413 --> 01:09:40.479
Because when I
first had it done.

1565
01:09:40.514 --> 01:09:43.416
it was almost bald. and I fought
everyone would laugh at me.

1566
01:09:43.451 --> 01:09:44.417
But they haven't. They've
started liking it.
