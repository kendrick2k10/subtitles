00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:31.664
[shrieking]

6
00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:32.665
-Hi.
-Hi.

7
00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:33.700
-Sorry.
-What?

8
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.734
-What?
-Where are we?

9
00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:37.737
Oh...

10
00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:46.146
[***]

11
00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:47.147
We're in Vegas.

12
00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:50.417
Vegas?

13
00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:51.718
We're in Vegas.

14
00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:57.490
There's a ring on my finger.

15
00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.559
Oh. no.

16
00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.061
Wait. did we get married?

17
00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.604
To finally getting that MBA!

18
00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:12.706
Whoo!

19
00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:14.507
MBA!

20
00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:19.179
Step one--

21
00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:20.547
graduate business school.

22
00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:21.548
Step two--

23
00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:22.582
conquer the world!

24
00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:23.750
[Nate] Think big. win big!

25
00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:29.856
My girl Riley is going
to dazzle Beacon America

26
00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:31.358
with her marketing prowess!

27
00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:33.593
Yeah. I'll be lucky
if I'm even noticed there. so.

28
00:01:34.694 --> 00:01:35.829
Would you rather
go on a date

29
00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.131
with that handsome.
strapping gentleman over there.

30
00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:39.766
or Nate?

31
00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:42.569
Okay. well.
that's not really fair.

32
00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:44.137
because that guy's super-hot.

33
00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:45.605
and Nate's a nice guy.

34
00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:47.540
"Beacon America CFO arrested."

35
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.242
"A grand jury has indicted

36
00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:50.643
the CFO
of a sporting-goods giant.

37
00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:51.878
Beacon America.

38
00:01:51.878 --> 00:01:54.381
for embezzling $80 million

39
00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:55.915
over the past five years."

40
00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:57.417
-[gasps]
-Wait. what?

41
00:01:57.417 --> 00:01:59.152
No.

42
00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:02.288
Okay. so all hiring
is on hold?

43
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:05.892
Right. I was supposed
to start next week.

44
00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:07.060
so that can't be.

45
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.495
I would...

46
00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:09.896
Hello?

47
00:02:09.896 --> 00:02:11.631
You look like
you needed some "compny".

48
00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:15.902
"Compa-nee."

49
00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:17.103
Thanks. Nate.

50
00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:18.471
but I don't really
feel like talking.

51
00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.474
You know. I just want
what everyone else wants.

52
00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:24.778
I want a job that doesn't suck.

53
00:02:24.778 --> 00:02:26.413
And I want to pay off my loans.

54
00:02:26.413 --> 00:02:27.747
and I want...

55
00:02:27.747 --> 00:02:29.115
maybe a house.

56
00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:30.083
I don't know.

57
00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:30.984
I don't need. like.
a white picket fence

58
00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:34.254
or a Lexus in the driveway
with a ribbon.

59
00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:35.355
What are you going to do?

60
00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:37.524
My family business
is going through a rough patch.

61
00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:39.659
Dad's counting on me
to come home.

62
00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.161
help turn things around.

63
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:42.929
They could use a dose
of what you've got.

64
00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:44.197
She spent years

65
00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:45.532
trying to get me
to become a doctor.

66
00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:48.935
Why didn't you?

67
00:02:48.935 --> 00:02:49.836
Vasovagal syncope.

68
00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:52.505
You mean something's wrong
down there?

69
00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:54.607
What? No.

70
00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:57.677
"Vasovagal" means that
my blood pressure drops.

71
00:02:57.677 --> 00:03:00.947
I faint when I experience
trauma. I guess.

72
00:03:00.947 --> 00:03:01.715
Like if you see blood?

73
00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:03.216
Yeah.

74
00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:04.718
Yeah. I'm just down.

75
00:03:04.718 --> 00:03:07.053
Blood. fear.

76
00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:10.357
Anything. really. that triggers
my fight-or-flight reflex.

77
00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:11.958
The last thing you want
is boring.

78
00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.059
Really?

79
00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:14.894
To not being boring!

80
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.901
[***]

81
00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:37.884
[vomiting]

82
00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:41.254
It's nice to see

83
00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:42.689
the idea of marrying me
makes you nauseous.

84
00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:46.926
Not nauseous.
Nauseated.

85
00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:48.995
I mean. just. like.

86
00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:49.996
I'm not this girl.

87
00:03:49.996 --> 00:03:52.732
I don't get blacked out in Vegas
and get married.

88
00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:55.702
You know. I'm the girl
who gets locked in the library

89
00:03:55.702 --> 00:03:57.704
because I was studying too long.

90
00:03:57.704 --> 00:03:58.705
Yeah. I don't do
this stuff either.

91
00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:01.374
I've been dating the same girl
my whole life.

92
00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:02.742
It's my high-school girlfriend.

93
00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:03.777
We broke up after graduation

94
00:04:03.777 --> 00:04:06.212
and got back together
senior year of college.

95
00:04:06.212 --> 00:04:07.347
and we've been trying

96
00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:08.782
to make it work long-distance
ever since. actually.

97
00:04:08.782 --> 00:04:09.949
That sounds really complicated.

98
00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:12.185
and I feel like we should
unpack that at a different time.

99
00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:13.219
Yeah.

100
00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:15.455
Look. I don't understand.
How could this happen?

101
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.124
I don't know. Nate.

102
00:04:18.124 --> 00:04:19.359
I don't know.

103
00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.695
The last thing I remember

104
00:04:21.695 --> 00:04:23.363
is you were...

105
00:04:23.363 --> 00:04:24.798
you were trying to convince me

106
00:04:24.798 --> 00:04:26.700
to help turn
your family business around.

107
00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:30.370
[laughs]

108
00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:33.573
Yeah. that was silly. huh?

109
00:04:33.573 --> 00:04:34.574
Oh. my god. my family.

110
00:04:34.574 --> 00:04:35.975
they're gonna freak out.

111
00:04:35.975 --> 00:04:37.744
I mean. we have to get divorced.

112
00:04:37.744 --> 00:04:39.379
-Right.
-Yeah.

113
00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:40.447
Yeah.

114
00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:41.214
-We have to--
-Right.

115
00:04:41.214 --> 00:04:42.949
Although.
if you think about it.

116
00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.084
it's not that silly at all.

117
00:04:44.084 --> 00:04:46.486
Not the marriage part.
We'll obviously get it annulled.

118
00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:47.454
Obviously.

119
00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:48.722
But you're smart
and resourceful.

120
00:04:48.722 --> 00:04:50.090
That's exactly
the kind of exec we need.

121
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.990
What?

122
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.891
Riley. just--

123
00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:53.093
I'm telling you.
it's a big opportunity.

124
00:04:53.093 --> 00:04:54.828
If you'd just take the time
to consider what I'm saying.

125
00:04:54.828 --> 00:04:55.895
Wait. wait. wait. wait.
hold on.

126
00:04:55.895 --> 00:04:57.097
Are you asking me for real?

127
00:04:58.098 --> 00:04:59.232
Yes. I am.

128
00:04:59.232 --> 00:05:00.900
No. I'm a west-coast girl.

129
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:01.835
You know?

130
00:05:01.835 --> 00:05:04.337
I like to go hiking in Marin.

131
00:05:04.337 --> 00:05:05.839
And eat pork buns at Wing Lee's.

132
00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:08.041
I don't think I'm gonna fit in
with your...

133
00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:11.111
little family business
in Tennessee.

134
00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:12.412
Do you know what I mean?

135
00:05:12.412 --> 00:05:14.047
Yeah.

136
00:05:14.047 --> 00:05:15.148
If you change your mind.

137
00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:16.583
there'll be a ticket
waiting for you.

138
00:05:23.523 --> 00:05:26.826
If I were doing
a case-method analysis.

139
00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:28.128
I would say that a)

140
00:05:28.128 --> 00:05:30.363
it's a legit job offer.

141
00:05:30.363 --> 00:05:33.633
and b) the cost of living
is way cheaper than here.

142
00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:36.770
Plus. Nate's kinda cute.

143
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.304
Okay. well.

144
00:05:38.304 --> 00:05:40.707
my response would be

145
00:05:40.707 --> 00:05:44.210
a) I don't need a guy
to make me happy.

146
00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.079
and b)

147
00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:47.480
it was...

148
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.815
a mistake!

149
00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:50.650
Doesn't look like a mistake.

150
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.652
Hell. this thing looks real.

151
00:05:52.652 --> 00:05:53.787
I doubt it.

152
00:05:53.787 --> 00:05:55.522
I think he got it at. like.
a drive-through chapel.

153
00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:57.891
I'm so proud of you.

154
00:05:57.891 --> 00:06:00.527
You finally did
something spontaneous.

155
00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:02.128
Hey. thank you so much.

156
00:06:03.897 --> 00:06:05.799
Girl. I love you.

157
00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:07.801
but you can't plan
every minute of your life.

158
00:06:07.801 --> 00:06:09.402
"It takes courage

159
00:06:09.402 --> 00:06:12.072
to grow up and become
who you really are."

160
00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:14.040
Are you throwing Oprah
at me right now?

161
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.075
No. e e cummings.

162
00:06:15.075 --> 00:06:16.710
Oh. that's it.

163
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:17.911
Oprah said.

164
00:06:17.911 --> 00:06:18.778
"You get in life

165
00:06:18.778 --> 00:06:20.347
what you have the courage
to ask for."

166
00:06:20.347 --> 00:06:22.349
Okay. what does that

167
00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:25.719
have to do with this ring?

168
00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:26.920
Maybe it's time
to stop planning.

169
00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:29.389
Do something outrageous.

170
00:06:30.256 --> 00:06:32.926
Like move to Tennessee

171
00:06:32.926 --> 00:06:34.361
and work for
a mom and pop company?

172
00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:37.564
Would you rather
move you and Herb

173
00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:38.832
back home with your parents?

174
00:06:46.106 --> 00:06:50.443
[***]

175
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.451
I got a call
from your Aunt Joan.

176
00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:01.921
She says your cousin Kaitlyn
just bought a new home.

177
00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:03.690
With a guest house
for Aunt Joan.

178
00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:04.758
Wow.

179
00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:06.026
Kaitlyn must be doing
very well.

180
00:07:06.026 --> 00:07:07.861
Yeah. Mom.
surgeons make good money.

181
00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:10.030
Let's eat!

182
00:07:11.064 --> 00:07:12.232
Dad.

183
00:07:12.232 --> 00:07:14.067
where did you
get that shirt?

184
00:07:14.067 --> 00:07:15.902
My AP Bio class
gave it to me.

185
00:07:17.137 --> 00:07:18.238
Did they give you those shoes?

186
00:07:18.238 --> 00:07:19.539
No. no. Knock-offs.

187
00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:20.807
I got 'em at BuyRite.

188
00:07:20.807 --> 00:07:22.375
Ugh.

189
00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:23.643
What's wrong with BuyRite?

190
00:07:23.643 --> 00:07:25.445
Well. they underpay
their employees.

191
00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:26.579
their stuff is cheap

192
00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:27.881
because it's cheaply-made.

193
00:07:27.881 --> 00:07:28.782
Listen to you.

194
00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:30.417
who buys half her clothes
at thrift shops.

195
00:07:30.417 --> 00:07:31.418
Not thrift.

196
00:07:31.418 --> 00:07:32.652
It's vintage.

197
00:07:32.652 --> 00:07:34.054
Don't worry. Suzanne.

198
00:07:34.054 --> 00:07:35.055
from now on.

199
00:07:35.055 --> 00:07:36.956
Riley's gonna get me
all the sneakers I need

200
00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:38.291
at Beacon.

201
00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:40.960
Yeah. so. um--

202
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.328
Oh. yeah. it won't be long

203
00:07:42.328 --> 00:07:43.430
before you're running
that whole company.

204
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.464
Am I right?

205
00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:46.733
And don't forget to bring
Aunt Joan a nice gift

206
00:07:46.733 --> 00:07:47.901
when you get to L.A.

207
00:07:47.901 --> 00:07:49.269
Why. Mom?

208
00:07:49.269 --> 00:07:50.403
It is the right thing to do.

209
00:07:50.403 --> 00:07:51.771
Mom.

210
00:07:51.771 --> 00:07:52.739
you have to stop
comparing me to Kaitlyn.

211
00:07:52.739 --> 00:07:54.507
Joan does the comparing.

212
00:07:54.507 --> 00:07:57.177
She forgets that
your brother would've been--

213
00:07:57.177 --> 00:07:58.611
A great doctor. yeah.

214
00:07:58.611 --> 00:08:01.748
Okay. we both know
how hard you work.

215
00:08:01.748 --> 00:08:03.016
No daughter
makes her parents prouder.

216
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.118
Aside from Kaitlyn. of course.

217
00:08:06.119 --> 00:08:07.153

218
00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:08.355

00:08:08.355 --> 00:08:10.290
Mom.

220
00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:11.758
Mom?

221
00:08:11.758 --> 00:08:12.892
When the time is right.

222
00:08:12.892 --> 00:08:17.030
I promise I will be happy
to have you move in with me.

223
00:08:18.131 --> 00:08:19.699
Not without a guest house.

224
00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:20.934
We need our privacy.

225
00:08:20.934 --> 00:08:22.035
Your father can get loud.

226
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:24.437
-Ew.
-It's true.

227
00:08:25.205 --> 00:08:26.539
-Stop.
-She probably knows already.

228
00:08:29.876 --> 00:08:31.511
I mean...

229
00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:33.213
I don't even know
why I'm considering it.

230
00:08:33.213 --> 00:08:34.514
I don't know anything
about them.

231
00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:37.283
Nate's family
probably says stuff

232
00:08:37.283 --> 00:08:38.685
like "what needs washed?"

233
00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:40.620
and they probably love
Miracle Whip.

234
00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.055
And you know how I feel
about Miracle Whip.

235
00:08:43.957 --> 00:08:46.493
But Mom and Dad
want me to be a big success.

236
00:08:48.395 --> 00:08:49.729
Yeah. I know.

237
00:08:52.132 --> 00:08:53.299
I wish you could give me a sign.

do you have boba?

Excuse me?

00:09:51.358 --> 00:09:53.793
Taiwanese bubble tea.

With tapioca balls.

Trust me. they don't have it.

It's quiet.

266
00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:25.825
The people
seem friendly. though.

267
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.095
You know that studies show

268
00:10:29.095 --> 00:10:30.230
the reason that people
from small towns are friendlier

269
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:31.297
isn't altruism.

270
00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:34.000
It's actually necessity.

271
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.402
Yeah. because.

272
00:10:35.402 --> 00:10:36.803
you know. due to
the small population.

273
00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:38.972
it's more likely
they'll. you know.

274
00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:40.640
need help in the future.

275
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.008
Do you always use
scientific data

276
00:10:42.008 --> 00:10:43.777
to lure people
into conversations?

277
00:10:43.777 --> 00:10:45.645
Not always.

278
00:10:46.746 --> 00:10:47.981
Is that a turtle?

00:10:48.915 --> 00:10:50.450
Oh. yeah.
That's Herb.

280
00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:51.451
When I was little.

281
00:10:51.451 --> 00:10:53.186
they didn't allow dogs
in my apartment complex.

282
00:10:53.186 --> 00:10:54.654
so I got Herb.

283
00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:56.022
He's a good listener.

284
00:10:56.022 --> 00:10:58.191
You just take him around
everywhere you go?

285
00:10:58.191 --> 00:10:59.159
No. of course not.

286
00:11:00.293 --> 00:11:01.127
But I can't exactly

287
00:11:01.127 --> 00:11:02.662
leave him in the car
with my luggage.

288
00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:04.664
Well. I probably could.

289
00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:05.765
There's no laws against it.

290
00:11:05.765 --> 00:11:07.167
which is...

291
00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:07.967
Yeah. well.
I'm not a monster.

292
00:11:10.537 --> 00:11:11.538
So do you live here?

293
00:11:11.538 --> 00:11:13.606
I used to live here.

294
00:11:14.641 --> 00:11:15.975
Oh. Why'd you leave?

295
00:11:17.344 --> 00:11:18.345
Are you a reporter?

00:11:21.114 --> 00:11:22.282
Oh. thank you so much.

Oh. actually--

00:11:27.087 --> 00:11:28.788
It's better
for the environment.

00:11:34.294 --> 00:11:35.328
Mm.

302
00:11:35.328 --> 00:11:37.997
Sorry. You were just telling me
why you left?

303
00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:40.233
Actually. I wasn't.

304
00:11:41.468 --> 00:11:42.502
I feel like you were.

305
00:11:44.671 --> 00:11:46.373
I created
a financial services app

306
00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:47.407
in Seattle.

307
00:11:47.407 --> 00:11:48.808

divorced.

309
00:11:49.843 --> 00:11:50.877
sold the app.

310
00:11:50.877 --> 00:11:52.879
and I came back home.

311
00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:53.646
Doesn't sound like
it was your idea.

has a seat at the table.

to the Smoky Mountains.

00:14:46.152 --> 00:14:47.153
I don't understand it.

370
00:14:47.153 --> 00:14:48.722
<i>Now is when I should be</i>

371
00:14:48.722 --> 00:14:50.724
building my career. you know?

372
00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:54.094
Not just fantasizing
about some stranger.

373
00:14:54.094 --> 00:14:55.562
Plus. I don't need a guy--

374
00:14:55.562 --> 00:14:57.197
--to make you happy.
Yeah. yeah.

375
00:14:57.197 --> 00:14:58.431
Aren't you there yet?

376
00:14:58.431 --> 00:14:59.466
<i>I'm lost.</i>

377
00:14:59.466 --> 00:15:01.234
You know. I don't know
if this is a good idea.

378
00:15:02.435 --> 00:15:04.337
I'm not sure how I'm going
to fit in here.

379
00:15:04.337 --> 00:15:05.338
<i>Then don't.</i>

380
00:15:05.338 --> 00:15:07.273
"Why fit in when you were born
to stand out?"

381
00:15:07.273 --> 00:15:08.241
Maya Angelou?

382
00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:09.376
Dr. Seuss.

383
00:15:11.878 --> 00:15:12.912
Um. I gotta go.

384
00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:14.714
Okay. love you. Bye.

385
00:15:28.962 --> 00:15:30.530
No. I know. I know.

386
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:31.498
So I said to him.

387
00:15:31.498 --> 00:15:33.366
"Carl. if you wanna go
drinkin' after work.

388
00:15:33.366 --> 00:15:34.801
least you can do

389
00:15:34.801 --> 00:15:36.970
is pick up the kids
from school.

390
00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:38.471
Hell. I don't care
if you take 'em with you.

391
00:15:38.471 --> 00:15:40.073
as long as
I don't hafta get 'em."

392
00:15:40.073 --> 00:15:41.708
Oh! I'll call you back.

393
00:15:41.708 --> 00:15:42.942
You must be Riley!

394
00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:44.944
Nate told me
to keep an eye out for ya.

395
00:15:49.215 --> 00:15:50.417
That Marie Kondo

396
00:15:50.417 --> 00:15:52.719
says to surround yourself
with things that bring you joy.

397
00:15:52.719 --> 00:15:54.320
'Mingos bring me joy.

398
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.221
[laughs]

399
00:15:56.322 --> 00:15:57.657
Come on.

400
00:15:57.657 --> 00:15:59.292
-I love your suit.
-Thank you.

401
00:16:01.261 --> 00:16:02.095
[man] I'm tired

402
00:16:02.095 --> 00:16:04.330
of you questioning
everything I say.

403
00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:07.834
In case you haven't noticed.
I am in charge here.

404
00:16:07.834 --> 00:16:10.670
so pack up your crap
and get the hell out of here.

405
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:12.172
You're fired!

406
00:16:24.351 --> 00:16:25.485
[woman sighs]

407
00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:26.286
Hey. Ma.

408
00:16:26.286 --> 00:16:28.054
Don't you look nice.
Mother Faye.

409
00:16:28.054 --> 00:16:29.689
Pretty as a peach in June.

410
00:16:29.689 --> 00:16:32.192
I see we lost
another Marketing VP.

411
00:16:32.192 --> 00:16:34.861
All he did was gripe
about his budget.

412
00:16:34.861 --> 00:16:36.696
I told him how to save money.

413
00:16:36.696 --> 00:16:39.065
I told him to use Kaylee
in the campaign.

414
00:16:39.065 --> 00:16:42.936
Used car dealers
feature their wives in ads.

415
00:16:42.936 --> 00:16:45.138
not national brands.

416
00:16:45.138 --> 00:16:46.673
I do have
my own YouTube channel.

417
00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:49.142
Don't you have somewhere to be?

418
00:16:53.146 --> 00:16:57.684
Son. we are already facing
another quarter in the red.

419
00:16:57.684 --> 00:16:59.686
Your daddy
would be so disappointed.

420
00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:02.322
Look all you want. Ma.

421
00:17:02.322 --> 00:17:05.025
You won't find him up there.

422
00:17:05.025 --> 00:17:07.560
This young lady's
here to see Nate.

423
00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:08.495
He said to bring her in here.

424
00:17:13.033 --> 00:17:14.367
Uh...

425
00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:16.036
this is probably a mistake.

426
00:17:16.036 --> 00:17:18.038
I'm looking for Nate Fisher.

427
00:17:18.038 --> 00:17:19.639
That's my grandson.

428
00:17:19.639 --> 00:17:20.874
Nathaniel Fisher Bynam.

429
00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:23.543
I'm his dad. Nathaniel Sr..

430
00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:25.178
but 'round here
everybody calls me "Buck".

431
00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:27.647
Bynam?

432
00:17:27.647 --> 00:17:29.849
As in the owners of...

433
00:17:29.849 --> 00:17:31.685
BuyRite Department Stores?

434
00:17:31.685 --> 00:17:32.919
Hi.

435
00:17:32.919 --> 00:17:34.054
Sorry. I was on
a conference call.

436
00:17:35.522 --> 00:17:36.256
Riley. are you okay?

437
00:17:38.358 --> 00:17:40.260
BuyRite
is your family business?

438
00:17:41.261 --> 00:17:42.696
Yeah.

439
00:17:44.731 --> 00:17:46.066
Oh!

440
00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:48.568
Winnie!

441
00:18:00.613 --> 00:18:02.382
Herb! Herb!
Did you catch Herb?

442
00:18:02.382 --> 00:18:03.116
-[Nate] He's fine.
-He's okay?

443
00:18:03.116 --> 00:18:04.551
[Nate] Yeah.

444
00:18:04.551 --> 00:18:06.019
I think you had one of
those vegan-bagel things.

445
00:18:06.019 --> 00:18:07.220
Vasovagal.

446
00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.355
Yes. thank you.

447
00:18:08.355 --> 00:18:10.190
I thought you said that
your last name was "Fisher".

448
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:12.025
I used my mom's name in school
to attract less attention.

449
00:18:12.025 --> 00:18:13.126
Gotcha.

450
00:18:13.126 --> 00:18:16.596
So. son. you wanna
catch us up here?

451
00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:18.798
Yeah. Dad.
this is Riley Smith.

452
00:18:18.798 --> 00:18:20.200
We went
to business school together.

453
00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.301
[Riley] Hi.

454
00:18:21.301 --> 00:18:22.302
And this is
my grandmother. Faye.

455
00:18:22.302 --> 00:18:23.470
Hi.

456
00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:25.271
-Welcome to Cedar Falls.
-Thank you.

457
00:18:27.407 --> 00:18:28.808
So you're here for a visit?

458
00:18:30.543 --> 00:18:31.578
Yeah.

459
00:18:31.578 --> 00:18:32.912
Well. actually.
she came to live.

460
00:18:36.716 --> 00:18:37.717
We're married.

461
00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:52.499
I thought that you said
we were getting an annulment.

462
00:18:52.499 --> 00:18:53.933
I'm sorry I blindsided you
with all that.

463
00:18:57.971 --> 00:19:00.073
Dad's been acting so erratic.
the board froze all hiring.

464
00:19:00.073 --> 00:19:01.808
So. the only way to bring you in

465
00:19:01.808 --> 00:19:03.309
is if we stay married
just for a little longer.

466
00:19:05.178 --> 00:19:06.813
BuyRite?

467
00:19:06.813 --> 00:19:08.515
I don't agree with any
of BuyRite's policies.

468
00:19:08.515 --> 00:19:09.816
At all.

469
00:19:09.816 --> 00:19:10.817
Then help change them.

470
00:19:10.817 --> 00:19:13.586
Look. BuyRite used to be
a great place to work.

471
00:19:13.586 --> 00:19:15.021
But the industry's changed.

472
00:19:15.021 --> 00:19:16.823
Since Mom died.
we've had to close 80 stores.

473
00:19:18.091 --> 00:19:19.092
We're not done.

474
00:19:19.092 --> 00:19:20.927
Well. you obviously...

475
00:19:20.927 --> 00:19:23.329
can't shut down Boise.

476
00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:24.464
There's nothing for 50 miles.

477
00:19:24.464 --> 00:19:25.799
You'd just be turning your backs

478
00:19:25.799 --> 00:19:26.666
on the customers
who need you the most.

479
00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:28.702
and you'll be
creating a PR nightmare.

480
00:19:28.702 --> 00:19:30.036
-You see?
-Do not look at me like that.

481
00:19:30.036 --> 00:19:31.705
You understand both sides.

482
00:19:31.705 --> 00:19:33.640
We'd offer a generous salary.

483
00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.574
Living rent-free with me.

484
00:19:34.574 --> 00:19:36.343
you could pay off your loans
in no time.

485
00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:37.344
Are you trying to bribe me?

486
00:19:37.344 --> 00:19:38.645
No.

487
00:19:38.645 --> 00:19:40.146
-'Cause it's working.
-Great.

488
00:19:40.146 --> 00:19:41.381
Oh. it's working.

489
00:19:41.381 --> 00:19:42.682
No. it can't work.

490
00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:44.617
I can't work for BuyRite.
This is--

491
00:19:46.653 --> 00:19:48.855
I can't go to my parents.

492
00:19:48.855 --> 00:19:51.124
My dad might not be able
to work much longer.

493
00:19:51.124 --> 00:19:52.392
-Welcome back.
-Emily!

494
00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:55.095
Oh. someone's working out?

495
00:19:55.095 --> 00:19:57.664
Oh. it's just
some interval training.

496
00:20:00.133 --> 00:20:02.002
-Hi.
-Hi. I'm Emily.

497
00:20:02.002 --> 00:20:03.837
Director of Corporate
Communications and Promotions.

498
00:20:03.837 --> 00:20:04.838
Oh. nice to meet you.

499
00:20:04.838 --> 00:20:05.839
And Nate's old girlfriend.

500
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.041
I'm Riley.

501
00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:09.142
I'm...

502
00:20:09.142 --> 00:20:11.411
Nate's...

503
00:20:11.411 --> 00:20:12.512
wife. I guess.

504
00:20:14.347 --> 00:20:15.682
You're married?

505
00:20:15.682 --> 00:20:17.150
It was very impromptu.

506
00:20:19.686 --> 00:20:20.653
Musta been.

507
00:20:20.653 --> 00:20:22.188
You didn't even have time
to get her a ring.

508
00:20:23.857 --> 00:20:25.158
Uh. yeah...

509
00:20:25.158 --> 00:20:26.893
I actually have it.

510
00:20:26.893 --> 00:20:28.161
It's in her purse. yeah.

511
00:20:28.161 --> 00:20:30.030
It was just getting resized.

512
00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:31.498
Traveling. so.

513
00:20:31.498 --> 00:20:33.700
Yup.

514
00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.769
Nate actually
has said a lot about you.

515
00:20:37.003 --> 00:20:38.505
-Really?
-Yeah.

516
00:20:38.505 --> 00:20:40.073
He never mentioned you.

517
00:20:41.408 --> 00:20:42.709
[Winnie speaks on intercom]
<i>Nate.</i>

518
00:20:42.709 --> 00:20:44.077
<i>can you tell Emily</i>

519
00:20:44.077 --> 00:20:45.745
<i>another bouquet</i>
<i>arrived from Andrew?</i>

520
00:20:46.913 --> 00:20:49.249
<i>That boy</i>
<i>is such a cutie-patootie.</i>

521
00:20:49.249 --> 00:20:51.551
[Nate] Thank you. Winnie.

522
00:20:51.551 --> 00:20:52.552
Andrew Baker?

523
00:20:54.387 --> 00:20:55.522
High-school football captain.

524
00:20:55.522 --> 00:20:56.623
Yeah.

525
00:20:56.623 --> 00:20:59.359
He's... so thoughtful.

526
00:21:02.395 --> 00:21:03.697
You know.
we should go to dinner.

527
00:21:04.864 --> 00:21:05.932
The four of us.

528
00:21:05.932 --> 00:21:08.468
Yeah. It would be fun. right?

529
00:21:08.468 --> 00:21:09.703
Yeah.

530
00:21:10.804 --> 00:21:11.871
Great!

531
00:21:15.241 --> 00:21:19.646
[***]

532
00:21:19.646 --> 00:21:20.714
[Riley]
This is where you grew up?

533
00:21:20.714 --> 00:21:24.718
[Nate] Look. I know that was
a lot for everyone.

534
00:21:24.718 --> 00:21:26.319
They just need a chance
to get to know you better.

535
00:21:27.987 --> 00:21:29.389
We're normal.

536
00:21:29.389 --> 00:21:30.490
They'll love you.

537
00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:31.725
You're normal?

538
00:21:31.725 --> 00:21:33.126
Yeah.

539
00:21:34.461 --> 00:21:37.263
There's. like.
15 garages here.

540
00:21:37.263 --> 00:21:38.932
14.

541
00:21:38.932 --> 00:21:41.735
It's called "Find Your Bliss
With Kaylee Bynam."

542
00:21:41.735 --> 00:21:43.503
So I get my squad together.

543
00:21:43.503 --> 00:21:45.839
and we talk about
female empowerment.

544
00:21:45.839 --> 00:21:47.774
You know. like being responsible
for your own orgasm.

545
00:21:50.343 --> 00:21:53.013
Mother Faye. there's nothing
wrong with enjoying sex.

546
00:21:53.013 --> 00:21:54.147
My dear.

547
00:21:54.147 --> 00:21:57.350
I was owning my own orgasm
long before you were born.

548
00:21:58.585 --> 00:22:00.587
Some things are best
left to yourself.

549
00:22:01.621 --> 00:22:03.256
I also bring on guests.

550
00:22:03.256 --> 00:22:06.626
Last week. I talked to a girl
who writes sci-fi erotica.

551
00:22:06.626 --> 00:22:09.863
And not just Captain Kirk
getting it on with Mr. Spock.

552
00:22:09.863 --> 00:22:11.498
Classy stuff.

553
00:22:11.498 --> 00:22:13.633
Okay. so it's a video podcast
and people subscribe to it also?

554
00:22:13.633 --> 00:22:15.101
From all over.

555
00:22:15.101 --> 00:22:16.936
Even men in prison.

556
00:22:16.936 --> 00:22:19.372
Especially men in prison.

557
00:22:19.372 --> 00:22:22.142
Yeah. maybe that's enough talk
about the podcast. babe.

558
00:22:22.142 --> 00:22:23.710
I'd like to propose a toast.

559
00:22:25.545 --> 00:22:26.646
Nate.

560
00:22:26.646 --> 00:22:28.348
I'm real proud of you.

561
00:22:28.348 --> 00:22:30.183
Sorry I couldn't make it
to the graduation.

562
00:22:30.183 --> 00:22:31.818
Thanks. Dad.

563
00:22:31.818 --> 00:22:32.786
It's good
to be home again.

564
00:22:34.354 --> 00:22:35.989
We're in this together.

565
00:22:35.989 --> 00:22:37.090
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

566
00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.829
I don't know why
you had to get married so fast.

567
00:22:42.829 --> 00:22:44.531
No family.

568
00:22:44.531 --> 00:22:45.832
I couldn't move back
without her.

569
00:22:47.133 --> 00:22:48.802
Riley's very special to me.

570
00:22:48.802 --> 00:22:50.637
Well. now.
that doesn't explain why--

571
00:22:50.637 --> 00:22:53.707
I understand that BuyRite's
been around for over 60 years?

572
00:22:54.874 --> 00:22:56.576
So what was your focus
at Stanford?

573
00:22:57.811 --> 00:22:59.412
Socially-conscious marketing.

574
00:22:59.412 --> 00:23:00.313
Really?

575
00:23:00.313 --> 00:23:03.350
What is
socially-conscious marketing?

576
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:04.818
It's a lot of nonsense.
that's what.

577
00:23:04.818 --> 00:23:05.852
Honey...

578
00:23:07.053 --> 00:23:08.054
No. it's a--

579
00:23:08.054 --> 00:23:09.856
it allows consumers
to connect with companies

580
00:23:09.856 --> 00:23:11.224
in a more meaningful way.

581
00:23:11.224 --> 00:23:13.560
So. like Verizon
with women in tech.

582
00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.062
or Dove's
positive-body-image ads.

583
00:23:17.163 --> 00:23:19.766
That's the fatties
in the underwear. right?

584
00:23:21.501 --> 00:23:23.269
Really.

585
00:23:23.269 --> 00:23:25.205
it's a load of woke PR
is what it is.

586
00:23:25.205 --> 00:23:26.373
I think companies

587
00:23:26.373 --> 00:23:27.307
have a responsibility

588
00:23:27.307 --> 00:23:30.176
to better society
in any way that they can.

589
00:23:30.176 --> 00:23:32.612
My company provides jobs.

590
00:23:32.612 --> 00:23:34.347
We don't get anywhere
near enough credit for that.

591
00:23:34.347 --> 00:23:36.182
You do get tax breaks. though.

592
00:23:36.182 --> 00:23:37.317
which leaves towns

593
00:23:37.317 --> 00:23:40.553
with less money for schools
and emergency services.

594
00:23:40.553 --> 00:23:43.990
What Riley's trying to say
is our brand needs a makeover.

595
00:23:46.693 --> 00:23:48.528
Her perspective will be valuable
to our marketing department.

596
00:23:48.528 --> 00:23:49.629
[Buck] Will be?

597
00:23:49.629 --> 00:23:51.097
You just hold on
a minute there. son.

598
00:23:51.097 --> 00:23:52.532
[Faye] I think...

599
00:23:52.532 --> 00:23:55.902
the company could use
a fresh pair of eyes.

600
00:24:01.708 --> 00:24:04.477
[***]

601
00:24:06.112 --> 00:24:07.280
You know.

602
00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.715
BuyRite obviously can't compete
with online companies

603
00:24:08.715 --> 00:24:10.050
offering free delivery. so.

604
00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:11.584
There's a news flash.

605
00:24:13.053 --> 00:24:15.088
You're saying
we should concentrate

606
00:24:15.088 --> 00:24:17.057
on bringing customers
into the stores?

607
00:24:17.057 --> 00:24:18.058
[Nate] Yes.

608
00:24:18.058 --> 00:24:20.060
Cedar Falls used to be
one of our best outlets.

609
00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.961
but it just had
its worst quarter in five years.

610
00:24:21.961 --> 00:24:23.930
Now. if you're talkin'
about give-aways--

611
00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:25.298
It's not about gimmicks. Dad.

612
00:24:25.298 --> 00:24:26.666
We need to revitalize the brand.

613
00:24:26.666 --> 00:24:29.602
You know.
improve the retail experiences.

614
00:24:29.602 --> 00:24:30.870
bringing in younger customers.

615
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:34.474
There's a lot of room to pair
with social-media influencers.

616
00:24:36.109 --> 00:24:37.477
I'll give you Cedar Falls.

617
00:24:37.477 --> 00:24:38.812
Mother--

618
00:24:38.812 --> 00:24:43.283
Come up with a plan
to turn things around

619
00:24:43.283 --> 00:24:44.284
and we'll talk.

620
00:24:44.284 --> 00:24:48.088
And because leadership skills
are important.

621
00:24:48.088 --> 00:24:50.256
I've asked Rhys to return.

622
00:24:50.256 --> 00:24:51.791
[Nate] What?

623
00:24:51.791 --> 00:24:53.093
What. Rhys is joining BuyRite?

624
00:24:53.093 --> 00:24:54.928
Just to keep the Board happy.

625
00:24:54.928 --> 00:24:56.196
Once we're back on solid ground.

626
00:24:56.196 --> 00:24:58.698
he can go
where he damn well pleases.

627
00:24:58.698 --> 00:25:00.633
Who's Rhys?

628
00:25:00.633 --> 00:25:02.035
I told you about Rhys.
Remember?

629
00:25:02.035 --> 00:25:04.104
You didn't know
that Nate had a brother?

630
00:25:05.672 --> 00:25:06.806
No.

631
00:25:06.806 --> 00:25:07.707
Sorry I missed dinner. Grandma.

632
00:25:18.218 --> 00:25:19.619
Hi.

633
00:25:23.629 --> 00:25:24.697
[Leila]
<i>So let me get this straight--</i>

634
00:25:24.697 --> 00:25:26.265
<i>Mr. Milkshake.</i>
<i>the man of your dreams.</i>

635
00:25:26.265 --> 00:25:28.501
<i>is your husband's brother?</i>

636
00:25:29.502 --> 00:25:31.337
Yes. Well. no.

637
00:25:31.337 --> 00:25:32.905
I don't know.

638
00:25:32.905 --> 00:25:34.607
Stop laughing.

639
00:25:34.607 --> 00:25:35.842
This isn't funny.

640
00:25:35.842 --> 00:25:37.043
Oh. what should I do?

641
00:25:37.043 --> 00:25:39.245
<i>Off the top of my head...</i>

642
00:25:39.245 --> 00:25:40.580
<i>move up the annulment!</i>

643
00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:41.848
I can't move it up.

644
00:25:41.848 --> 00:25:43.149
Well. because this is
kind of interesting.

645
00:25:43.149 --> 00:25:44.584
The plan is
we have to be working.

646
00:25:44.584 --> 00:25:45.952
Plus. his grandma's very cool.

647
00:25:45.952 --> 00:25:47.120
[Buck] Riley?

648
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.588
<i>Yeah. you gotta go.</i>

649
00:25:52.425 --> 00:25:53.793
Mr. Bynam.

650
00:25:53.793 --> 00:25:55.061
Hi.

651
00:25:55.061 --> 00:25:57.797
I don't know what kind of game
you're running here. missy.

652
00:25:57.797 --> 00:26:00.466
I think you have
the wrong idea. I--

653
00:26:00.466 --> 00:26:02.135
You don't have to be a genius

654
00:26:02.135 --> 00:26:03.703
to see that Nate's in
over his head.

655
00:26:03.703 --> 00:26:05.171
so cards on the table.

656
00:26:06.305 --> 00:26:07.807
Am I gonna be a grandpa?

657
00:26:08.875 --> 00:26:09.709
What?

658
00:26:09.709 --> 00:26:11.044
Oh. no.

659
00:26:11.044 --> 00:26:12.612
No. no. I'm not...

660
00:26:12.612 --> 00:26:15.148
pregnant. so.

661
00:26:15.148 --> 00:26:19.052
Okay. then I will pay
whatever is in your prenup.

662
00:26:20.887 --> 00:26:21.888
Uh...

663
00:26:21.888 --> 00:26:23.856
Oh. sweet Jesus.

664
00:26:25.625 --> 00:26:27.660
Mr. Bynam. I...

665
00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.495
I don't want
anything from you.

666
00:26:29.495 --> 00:26:31.230
Really. I'm...

667
00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:33.566
Nate thinks BuyRite
is worth saving.

668
00:26:33.566 --> 00:26:35.134
and...

669
00:26:35.134 --> 00:26:36.235
I can help.

670
00:26:39.205 --> 00:26:40.206
I'm gonna...

671
00:27:09.335 --> 00:27:11.004
Why didn't you tell me
who you were?

672
00:27:11.004 --> 00:27:12.705
Why didn't you tell me
you were married?

673
00:27:15.041 --> 00:27:19.612
Oh. it's so nice having
my boys back in the house again.

674
00:27:19.612 --> 00:27:21.280
You're not afraid we'll end up
killing each other?

675
00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.749
Oh. well.

676
00:27:22.749 --> 00:27:25.351
that's a distinct possibility.

677
00:27:25.351 --> 00:27:27.720
but it's a risk
I'm willing to take.

678
00:27:32.358 --> 00:27:34.594
Congrats. by the way.

679
00:27:34.594 --> 00:27:35.895
Thank you.

680
00:27:35.895 --> 00:27:37.296
I was referring to Nate.

681
00:27:37.296 --> 00:27:38.431
Clearly. he got
the better end of the deal.

682
00:27:40.033 --> 00:27:41.401
[laughs]

683
00:27:42.902 --> 00:27:43.503
Why'd you have to go
and say that?

684
00:27:43.503 --> 00:27:44.904
She thinks I'm a catch.

685
00:27:44.904 --> 00:27:45.938
No one thinks
you're a catch. Nate.

686
00:27:48.775 --> 00:27:50.076
I think you're a catch. Nate.

687
00:27:50.076 --> 00:27:52.645
I see you gave her mom's ring.

688
00:27:56.082 --> 00:27:57.717
It's not like
you were using it.

689
00:28:01.754 --> 00:28:02.789
It's good to be home.

690
00:28:09.729 --> 00:28:12.765
[***]

691
00:28:12.765 --> 00:28:14.000
What do you got in there?

692
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.001
Sorry.

693
00:28:16.302 --> 00:28:17.770
Like. what?

694
00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:19.005
Dead bodies.

695
00:28:19.005 --> 00:28:20.473
Oh. it's just up here.

696
00:28:23.009 --> 00:28:25.011
And off we go.

697
00:28:25.011 --> 00:28:26.446
Oh. watch out.

698
00:28:26.446 --> 00:28:27.747
-Be careful.
-I'm okay!

699
00:28:29.515 --> 00:28:33.252
[***]

700
00:28:36.022 --> 00:28:37.757
[exhales]

701
00:28:37.757 --> 00:28:38.791
Okay...

702
00:28:38.791 --> 00:28:41.027
everything's set up.

703
00:28:41.027 --> 00:28:43.162
You can take the guest room.

704
00:28:43.162 --> 00:28:45.598
-Okay.
-Unless you want to sleep in--

705
00:28:45.598 --> 00:28:46.733
No. no.

706
00:28:46.733 --> 00:28:47.333
'Cause married people.
they stay in the same bedroom.

707
00:28:47.333 --> 00:28:49.035
We're not really married.

708
00:28:49.035 --> 00:28:51.037
That's--
the guest room is perfect.

709
00:28:51.037 --> 00:28:51.938
Thank you.

710
00:28:51.938 --> 00:28:53.673
This...

711
00:28:53.673 --> 00:28:56.042
is your mom's ring.

712
00:28:56.042 --> 00:28:58.177
You didn't mention that.

713
00:29:00.546 --> 00:29:01.881
[sighs]

714
00:29:01.881 --> 00:29:03.216
Thank you
for trusting me with this

715
00:29:03.216 --> 00:29:04.617
while we...

716
00:29:04.617 --> 00:29:06.052
you know. do this.

717
00:29:06.052 --> 00:29:07.620
It's really...

718
00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:08.988
Not a problem.

719
00:29:10.056 --> 00:29:10.990
It was for Emily. huh?

720
00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:14.727
Were you going to propose?

721
00:29:16.996 --> 00:29:17.797
We've been trying

722
00:29:17.797 --> 00:29:20.533
to keep things going
long-distance.

723
00:29:20.533 --> 00:29:21.701
She was supposed
to fly out for graduation.

724
00:29:21.701 --> 00:29:23.403
but she called the night before.

725
00:29:23.403 --> 00:29:25.705
and said...

726
00:29:25.705 --> 00:29:27.807
she'd met someone else.

727
00:29:29.008 --> 00:29:30.510
Oh!

728
00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:32.812
Okay. That's why
you got so drunk.

729
00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:36.082
She was tired
of being taken for granted.

730
00:29:37.483 --> 00:29:38.918
She said. um...

731
00:29:38.918 --> 00:29:40.520
she said I didn't
appreciate her enough.

732
00:29:43.723 --> 00:29:44.757
She was right.
I blew it.

733
00:29:46.359 --> 00:29:47.493
Okay. Nate. it's--

734
00:29:47.493 --> 00:29:48.828
No. Riley. it's fine.

735
00:29:50.697 --> 00:29:51.831
She moved on.

736
00:29:53.833 --> 00:29:54.934
So should I.

737
00:30:15.388 --> 00:30:17.123
You know. I could probably
get a plant or two in here.

738
00:30:17.123 --> 00:30:18.191
You know.

739
00:30:18.191 --> 00:30:19.125
warm up the space.

740
00:30:20.727 --> 00:30:21.694
I don't plan
on staying here long.

741
00:30:25.431 --> 00:30:27.066
Have you done
any work in sales?

742
00:30:28.768 --> 00:30:30.603
Well. I worked
at Urban Outfitters

743
00:30:30.603 --> 00:30:32.405
when I was a teenager
during the summer.

744
00:30:32.405 --> 00:30:33.940
-Does that count?
-[Nate] Yeah.

745
00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.909
So she knows
how to upsell stoners.

746
00:30:36.909 --> 00:30:38.277
It's perfect for us.

747
00:30:38.277 --> 00:30:40.246
I don't think you understand

748
00:30:40.246 --> 00:30:41.114
what you're
getting yourself into.

749
00:30:41.114 --> 00:30:45.785
My dad is looking
for anyone to blame.

750
00:30:45.785 --> 00:30:47.320
And he's a bit unhinged.

751
00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.488
I think
I can handle myself. Rhys.

752
00:30:48.488 --> 00:30:49.322
I have an MBA.

753
00:30:49.322 --> 00:30:51.557
[Nate] Why do you always
attack him?

754
00:30:51.557 --> 00:30:52.592
Why do you always defend him?

755
00:30:54.327 --> 00:30:55.662
You know he's been this way
since we were kids.

756
00:30:55.662 --> 00:30:56.596
He thinks
the world is against him.

757
00:30:57.964 --> 00:31:00.033
Seventh grade. summer camp.
laser tag.

758
00:31:00.033 --> 00:31:01.501
no one wanted to be on his team

759
00:31:01.501 --> 00:31:02.568
because if poor. little Rhysie
didn't win.

760
00:31:02.568 --> 00:31:03.670
he was furious.

761
00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:07.173
He'd always complain
that his vest wasn't working.

762
00:31:07.173 --> 00:31:09.676
My vest was not working.

763
00:31:09.676 --> 00:31:10.510
No matter
how many times he got hit.

764
00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:12.345
he always refused
to leave the game.

765
00:31:12.345 --> 00:31:13.813
Faulty vest.

766
00:31:13.813 --> 00:31:15.515
I guess some people
expect a trophy

767
00:31:15.515 --> 00:31:17.083
just for showing up.

768
00:31:19.052 --> 00:31:20.219
[intercom beeps]

769
00:31:20.219 --> 00:31:22.255
[Winnie] <i>Rhys.</i>
<i>your father wants to see you.</i>

770
00:31:29.295 --> 00:31:30.496
Well. that went well.

771
00:31:50.283 --> 00:31:51.351
Well...

772
00:31:51.351 --> 00:31:53.553
there's something
you don't see much around here.

773
00:31:53.553 --> 00:31:55.355
Yeah.

774
00:31:55.355 --> 00:31:57.957
No. no. don't. don't.
They're beautiful.

775
00:31:57.957 --> 00:31:59.225
I'm Demarcus.
From Operations.

776
00:31:59.225 --> 00:32:00.560
Riley.

777
00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.061
Nice to meet you.

778
00:32:02.061 --> 00:32:03.463
Um...

779
00:32:03.463 --> 00:32:05.198
well. how can I help you?

780
00:32:05.198 --> 00:32:07.500
Well. Nate wants you
to go undercover.

781
00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.302
scope out
the Cedar Falls store.

782
00:32:09.302 --> 00:32:10.303
Oh. okay.

783
00:32:10.303 --> 00:32:11.671
Well. um...

784
00:32:11.671 --> 00:32:13.840
let me check my schedule.

785
00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.875
She says.
pretending she has a schedule.

786
00:32:18.044 --> 00:32:19.212
Sorry. yeah.

787
00:32:19.212 --> 00:32:20.713
Undercover?
That's-- that's exciting.

788
00:32:20.713 --> 00:32:22.749
Do I have. like--
like a backstory?

789
00:32:22.749 --> 00:32:24.651
Or a disguise?

790
00:32:25.718 --> 00:32:27.587
Simmer down. Veronica Mars.

791
00:32:27.587 --> 00:32:28.488
I told the manager

792
00:32:28.488 --> 00:32:29.756
you've been transferred
from Memphis.

793
00:32:30.857 --> 00:32:31.858
And you'll wear these.

794
00:32:36.729 --> 00:32:37.897
Okay.

795
00:32:39.098 --> 00:32:41.100
Okay.

796
00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:42.235
I know. honey.

797
00:32:42.235 --> 00:32:43.870
Don't even try to explain it.
It's a waste of time.

798
00:32:44.937 --> 00:32:46.272
Like watching golf.

799
00:32:46.272 --> 00:32:47.540
or eating kale.

800
00:32:48.841 --> 00:32:49.942
My theory is.

801
00:32:49.942 --> 00:32:51.110
they designed them
back in the '70s

802
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:52.412
to prevent workers
from hooking up.

803
00:32:54.747 --> 00:32:55.948
I'm guessing
it worked out pretty well.

804
00:32:57.450 --> 00:32:58.618
Enjoy!

805
00:32:59.852 --> 00:33:01.287
Nice to meet you!

806
00:33:09.729 --> 00:33:14.033
[***]

807
00:33:22.642 --> 00:33:26.045
[***]

808
00:33:26.913 --> 00:33:28.314
[man] Heads-up!

809
00:33:29.716 --> 00:33:31.150
Kenny!

810
00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:32.652
Knock it off. man!

811
00:33:32.652 --> 00:33:34.053
Sorry. Maria!

812
00:33:34.053 --> 00:33:35.922
Cooler display!
Aisle 12. Let's go!

813
00:33:35.922 --> 00:33:36.856
Yeah. but I was just--

814
00:33:36.856 --> 00:33:39.325
No. no. no!
<i>O te patearé tu trasero.</i>

815
00:33:39.325 --> 00:33:41.127
All right. boss.

816
00:33:41.127 --> 00:33:42.462
[speaks in Spanish]

817
00:33:42.462 --> 00:33:43.763
Okay!

818
00:33:45.765 --> 00:33:46.799
Come on. let's go.

819
00:33:48.835 --> 00:33:50.436
Well. he responds
to "I'll kick your ass."

820
00:33:50.436 --> 00:33:52.171
so that's--that's good.

821
00:33:52.171 --> 00:33:53.072
He's a good kid.

822
00:33:53.072 --> 00:33:54.741
You just need to know
how to reach him.

823
00:33:54.741 --> 00:33:56.309
Got it.

824
00:33:56.309 --> 00:33:57.610
-Riley?
-Yes. sorry.

825
00:33:57.610 --> 00:33:58.645
-Hi.
<i>-Hola.</i>

826
00:33:58.645 --> 00:34:00.313
I'm Maria.

827
00:34:00.313 --> 00:34:02.482
The manager's not here
so I'll take you around.

828
00:34:02.482 --> 00:34:03.650
-Great.
-Come this way.

829
00:34:05.485 --> 00:34:07.186
Now. that was Kenny.
and he's not gonna change.

830
00:34:07.186 --> 00:34:08.321
[Riley] Okay.

831
00:34:08.321 --> 00:34:12.025
We like to rotate the newbies
through each department.

832
00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.828
Unfortunately.
we have a high turnover rate.

833
00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:19.766
You see.
morale isn't exactly high.

834
00:34:21.167 --> 00:34:23.202
Josh!

835
00:34:23.202 --> 00:34:24.170
Becca!

836
00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:25.705
Man. where is everyone?

837
00:34:28.374 --> 00:34:29.776
Kenny!
Kenny! No. no. no. no!

838
00:34:29.776 --> 00:34:30.643
That's going to--

839
00:34:34.647 --> 00:34:36.349
-Whoops.
-Fall.

840
00:34:38.151 --> 00:34:39.152
As I was saying.

841
00:34:39.152 --> 00:34:41.120
we have pretty good barbecues.

842
00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:42.955
lawnmowers.

843
00:34:55.802 --> 00:34:56.736
Can't stand to lose. huh?

844
00:34:57.970 --> 00:34:59.305
Have you met Riley's parents?

845
00:34:59.305 --> 00:35:00.340
Not yet.

846
00:35:01.407 --> 00:35:02.508
What about siblings?

847
00:35:07.714 --> 00:35:08.848
I think she's an only child.

848
00:35:12.652 --> 00:35:13.553
How much do you know about her?

849
00:35:14.721 --> 00:35:15.588
We've been friends
for two years.

850
00:35:18.091 --> 00:35:19.058
You really think
it was a good idea.

851
00:35:19.058 --> 00:35:20.560
surprising Dad like that?

852
00:35:21.828 --> 00:35:23.029
Yeah.

853
00:35:23.029 --> 00:35:24.197
He'll come around.

854
00:35:26.866 --> 00:35:28.234
You always did
believe in miracles.

855
00:35:32.405 --> 00:35:34.607
[girl] I'm hungry.
I want these cookies.

856
00:35:34.607 --> 00:35:36.609
You can't keep taking cookies
from the shelves.

857
00:35:36.609 --> 00:35:38.111
-Hi.
-Hi.

858
00:35:38.111 --> 00:35:38.878
Who's this?

859
00:35:38.878 --> 00:35:40.079
She was separated
from her family.

860
00:35:40.079 --> 00:35:41.748
Oh. no.

861
00:35:41.748 --> 00:35:43.282
Hi. What's your name?

862
00:35:43.282 --> 00:35:44.384
Amalia.

863
00:35:45.284 --> 00:35:46.619
Amalia? Okay.

864
00:35:46.619 --> 00:35:48.388
I'm sure we can find them
somewhere.

865
00:35:48.388 --> 00:35:49.355
They're probably not far--

866
00:35:49.355 --> 00:35:51.057
Riley. why don't you take
a break for lunch?

867
00:35:51.057 --> 00:35:52.358
I'll go find her mom.

868
00:35:52.358 --> 00:35:54.060
-Oh. are you sure?
-Yeah.

869
00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:55.061
Of course.

870
00:35:55.061 --> 00:35:56.629
-Okay.
-Thanks.

871
00:35:56.629 --> 00:35:58.064
Come on.

872
00:36:00.633 --> 00:36:01.601
-Bye.
-Bye.

873
00:36:04.537 --> 00:36:05.571
Hello there!

874
00:36:08.107 --> 00:36:09.142
Hi.

875
00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:12.211
I'm Ted. the store manager.

876
00:36:12.211 --> 00:36:13.746
Right.

877
00:36:13.746 --> 00:36:15.315
-Hi.
-Hi.

878
00:36:16.449 --> 00:36:17.650
If I'd have known
you were this pretty.

879
00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:18.785
I would have been here
a lot sooner.

880
00:36:21.821 --> 00:36:24.791
Well. Maria's been doing
a really good job. so.

881
00:36:24.791 --> 00:36:27.427
Yeah. she's pretty good
for a part-timer.

882
00:36:27.427 --> 00:36:28.795
Love her spunk.

883
00:36:28.795 --> 00:36:30.163
Yeah. that's good to know...

884
00:36:31.898 --> 00:36:32.832
...Ted.

885
00:36:34.233 --> 00:36:35.435
[Riley] I mean.
the store's a mess.

886
00:36:35.435 --> 00:36:36.602
and Ted. he...

887
00:36:38.271 --> 00:36:39.639
That man sucks.

888
00:36:39.639 --> 00:36:41.607
Yeah. that's a non-starter.

889
00:36:41.607 --> 00:36:42.742
Ted is Faye's nephew.

890
00:36:42.742 --> 00:36:43.876
What?

891
00:36:43.876 --> 00:36:45.478
That's the only reason
he's had this job for so long.

892
00:36:45.478 --> 00:36:48.047
So. a little birdie told me

893
00:36:48.047 --> 00:36:50.516
that you got off
on the wrong foot with Buck.

894
00:36:50.516 --> 00:36:51.784
Yeah.

895
00:36:51.784 --> 00:36:53.086
Word of advice--

896
00:36:53.086 --> 00:36:54.787
don't poke the bear. honey.

897
00:36:54.787 --> 00:36:56.322
That could prove dangerous.

898
00:36:56.322 --> 00:36:57.290
Well--

899
00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:59.859
Oh. you're not
in Kansas anymore. Dorothy.

900
00:36:59.859 --> 00:37:01.461
And I sure as hell
ain't the wizard.

901
00:37:02.528 --> 00:37:03.529
That's too bad--

902
00:37:03.529 --> 00:37:04.797
there's a pair
of ruby slippers in footwear.

903
00:37:04.797 --> 00:37:06.165
Just my size.

904
00:37:09.135 --> 00:37:11.170
I am so sorry.

905
00:37:19.078 --> 00:37:20.913
I'm not talking about
a complete restructuring.

906
00:37:20.913 --> 00:37:22.081
I'm just saying

907
00:37:22.081 --> 00:37:23.916
if you pay people like Maria
what she's actually worth.

908
00:37:23.916 --> 00:37:24.751
then it would be--

909
00:37:24.751 --> 00:37:25.618
Do you know how much
it would cost

910
00:37:25.618 --> 00:37:27.286
to provide benefits
to part-timers?

911
00:37:27.286 --> 00:37:28.354
Well. she's not
actually part-time.

912
00:37:28.354 --> 00:37:29.622
You guys just call her that
because it's a way--

913
00:37:29.622 --> 00:37:30.490
I don't call it anything.

914
00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:32.792
I'm just here
on a temporary basis.

915
00:37:32.792 --> 00:37:34.093
and as soon as
things get in shape--

916
00:37:34.093 --> 00:37:35.928
You will be on your way.
Yes. I'm aware.

917
00:37:35.928 --> 00:37:39.032
You should just take it off.
The stain's gonna set.

918
00:37:39.032 --> 00:37:41.467
You know. so you can soak it...

919
00:37:42.502 --> 00:37:43.603
...or the shirt will be ruined.

920
00:37:49.042 --> 00:37:50.209
Okay...

921
00:37:53.546 --> 00:37:55.048
Okay. well...

922
00:37:56.949 --> 00:37:58.217
Oh. I'm not gonna do it.

923
00:37:58.217 --> 00:37:59.819
You can.

924
00:37:59.819 --> 00:38:01.521
Take this.
Here. you--

925
00:38:01.521 --> 00:38:03.122
You can just scrub it.

926
00:38:04.691 --> 00:38:06.159
Well. don't scrub it.

927
00:38:08.227 --> 00:38:09.195
Dab it.

928
00:38:10.363 --> 00:38:11.564
Ahem.

929
00:38:16.169 --> 00:38:17.470
What's going on?

930
00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:19.172
Um...

931
00:38:21.708 --> 00:38:23.376
I had the coffee and--

932
00:38:23.376 --> 00:38:24.510
She came around the corner.

933
00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:26.212
and then the--

934
00:38:26.212 --> 00:38:29.349
-The stain--
-All over it. so we're just--

935
00:38:29.349 --> 00:38:30.350
Dad and I decided.

936
00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:32.385
We're closing ten more stores.
Including Boise.

937
00:38:34.721 --> 00:38:35.822
Okay. then.

938
00:38:35.822 --> 00:38:37.390
By the way.

939
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:39.392
your wedding announcement's
gonna be in Sunday's paper.

940
00:38:41.928 --> 00:38:43.229
Yeah.

941
00:38:45.398 --> 00:38:46.399
Nate.

942
00:38:47.333 --> 00:38:48.167
My parents don't know yet.

943
00:38:48.167 --> 00:38:50.403
It's the "Cedar Falls
Chronicle".

944
00:38:50.403 --> 00:38:51.871
They'll never see it. okay?

945
00:38:56.542 --> 00:38:57.577
Can I. uh. get my shirt back?

946
00:38:57.577 --> 00:38:59.178
Yeah.

947
00:38:59.178 --> 00:39:00.880
Here you go.

948
00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:01.981
Um. I'm gonna--

949
00:39:01.981 --> 00:39:03.349
You can--yeah.

950
00:39:05.118 --> 00:39:06.085
[Leila] <i>You always do this.</i>

951
00:39:06.085 --> 00:39:07.387
Do what?

952
00:39:07.387 --> 00:39:08.454
<i>Miss the cues.</i>

953
00:39:08.454 --> 00:39:10.256
Remember that professor?

954
00:39:10.256 --> 00:39:11.858
He just gave me his umbrella.

955
00:39:11.858 --> 00:39:13.693
<i>During a thunderstorm.</i>

956
00:39:13.693 --> 00:39:14.727
You're ridiculous.

957
00:39:14.727 --> 00:39:16.362
And what about
that waiter?

958
00:39:16.362 --> 00:39:18.398
You really think
he comped our entire table

959
00:39:18.398 --> 00:39:19.565
<i>just 'cause your fish was dry?</i>

960
00:39:19.565 --> 00:39:20.700
Leila. I know
what you're doing

961
00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:21.734
and it's not going to work.

962
00:39:21.734 --> 00:39:23.302
<i>You know. you're trying</i>
<i>to make this</i>

963
00:39:23.302 --> 00:39:25.138
into something it's not.

964
00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:29.442
[***]

965
00:39:37.016 --> 00:39:42.622
[***]

966
00:39:48.161 --> 00:39:51.097
[***]

967
00:40:04.177 --> 00:40:05.678
Hey.

968
00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:29.202
Uh...

969
00:40:29.202 --> 00:40:30.203
hello.

970
00:40:30.203 --> 00:40:31.437
Hi.

971
00:40:39.712 --> 00:40:41.014
That used to be

972
00:40:41.014 --> 00:40:42.949
one of my favorite books
when I was your age.

973
00:40:45.551 --> 00:40:46.819
Um...

974
00:40:46.819 --> 00:40:48.388
so you're not--

975
00:40:48.388 --> 00:40:49.489
you're not lost again. right?

976
00:40:49.489 --> 00:40:50.523
No.

977
00:40:52.659 --> 00:40:53.960
Okay. well. enjoy the book.

978
00:40:55.895 --> 00:40:57.196
Bye.

979
00:40:59.165 --> 00:41:03.903
[***]

980
00:41:08.574 --> 00:41:12.078
Okay. so we've got
the ad guys in New York

981
00:41:12.078 --> 00:41:13.246
and then we'll meet
with the regional managers

982
00:41:13.246 --> 00:41:14.380
on the way home.

983
00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:15.415
We should only be gone a week.

984
00:41:15.415 --> 00:41:16.582
Okay.

985
00:41:16.582 --> 00:41:17.717
Don't worry.

986
00:41:17.717 --> 00:41:19.319
You're not missing out
on anything.

987
00:41:19.319 --> 00:41:20.653
It'll just be one boring meeting
after another.

988
00:41:20.653 --> 00:41:21.688
Oh. yeah.

989
00:41:21.688 --> 00:41:23.723
I'm not worried.

990
00:41:23.723 --> 00:41:25.058
You sure you'll be all right
on your own?

991
00:41:25.058 --> 00:41:26.092
Yeah.

992
00:41:26.092 --> 00:41:27.160
I'll be fine.

993
00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.161
-For a week?
-Yeah.

994
00:41:29.829 --> 00:41:30.697
-Okay.
-Okay.

995
00:41:30.697 --> 00:41:31.898
Bye.

996
00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.069
I... um...

997
00:41:36.069 --> 00:41:37.103
Give me a kiss.

998
00:41:37.103 --> 00:41:38.237
Come on.

999
00:41:38.237 --> 00:41:39.238
[Riley] What are you doing?

1000
00:41:39.238 --> 00:41:40.206
Give me a kiss. Please?

1001
00:41:45.378 --> 00:41:46.512
I'll get the door for you.

1002
00:41:46.512 --> 00:41:48.081
-Thanks.
-Right.

1003
00:41:48.081 --> 00:41:49.415
[Riley] Okay. fly safe.

1004
00:41:50.683 --> 00:41:52.085
[Nate] Yup. 'Kay.

1005
00:41:53.419 --> 00:41:54.754
Bye.

1006
00:41:57.090 --> 00:41:58.091
[exhales]

1007
00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:01.194
[Riley] I don't care

1008
00:42:01.194 --> 00:42:02.028
if something
happens between them.

1009
00:42:02.028 --> 00:42:04.197
Plus. you know.
Nate never said

1010
00:42:04.197 --> 00:42:07.600
that I couldn't
explore my options. so.

1011
00:42:10.203 --> 00:42:11.904
No. I can't come clean to Rhys.

1012
00:42:11.904 --> 00:42:13.406
because then I will blow
this whole thing.

1013
00:42:15.041 --> 00:42:16.142
Plus. I don't even know
if he feels the same way.

1014
00:42:16.142 --> 00:42:17.477
I just...

1015
00:42:19.445 --> 00:42:20.446
I don't know.
What do you think?

1016
00:42:25.051 --> 00:42:26.119
You're absolutely no help.

1017
00:42:28.588 --> 00:42:30.056
Agh!

1018
00:42:30.957 --> 00:42:32.392
Oh...

1019
00:42:32.392 --> 00:42:33.593
That's...

1020
00:42:35.228 --> 00:42:36.729
That's...

1021
00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:39.065
Oh. I'm feeling dizzy.

1022
00:42:39.065 --> 00:42:40.400
<i>[line ringing]</i>

1023
00:42:43.236 --> 00:42:44.637
Hey.

1024
00:42:44.637 --> 00:42:46.072
Hey...

1025
00:42:46.072 --> 00:42:47.907
so this is silly.

1026
00:42:47.907 --> 00:42:49.776
but I...

1027
00:42:49.776 --> 00:42:51.244
I cut my finger...

1028
00:42:51.244 --> 00:42:52.779
and...

1029
00:42:52.779 --> 00:42:54.847
and I'm just calling because...

1030
00:42:54.847 --> 00:42:56.416
you know.

1031
00:42:56.416 --> 00:42:58.451
there's...

1032
00:42:58.451 --> 00:43:00.853
there is so much blood
in the radio.

1033
00:43:06.659 --> 00:43:10.229
[***]

1034
00:43:16.302 --> 00:43:17.737
Hey.

1035
00:43:19.505 --> 00:43:20.807
Hey there.

1036
00:43:24.177 --> 00:43:25.745
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have called you.

1037
00:43:25.745 --> 00:43:27.046
No. no. Don't apologize.

1038
00:43:28.081 --> 00:43:29.749
I was just afraid it might look
like a crime scene.

1039
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:32.051
Thank you a lot for--

1040
00:43:32.051 --> 00:43:34.253
What?

1041
00:43:36.089 --> 00:43:37.857
Nothing.

1042
00:43:37.857 --> 00:43:38.958
Uh...

1043
00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:42.662
I think this is yours.

1044
00:43:45.431 --> 00:43:46.599
Thanks.

1045
00:43:49.202 --> 00:43:50.303
Is that your brother?

1046
00:43:51.537 --> 00:43:53.072
Yeah. that's Daniel.

1047
00:44:00.146 --> 00:44:01.714
Well. let's--
let's get you up.

1048
00:44:01.714 --> 00:44:03.016
Yeah.

1049
00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:08.054
Sure you're okay?

1050
00:44:08.054 --> 00:44:09.889
Yes. I'm--
Yeah. I'm okay.

1051
00:44:09.889 --> 00:44:13.192
No more--
no more sharp knives. okay?

1052
00:44:13.192 --> 00:44:14.460
Copy that.

1053
00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:16.329
You know. when in doubt.

1054
00:44:16.329 --> 00:44:18.031
PB&J is always a safer bet.

1055
00:44:20.166 --> 00:44:21.167
-Okay.
-Okay.

1056
00:44:23.703 --> 00:44:24.904
Take good care of her. Herb.

1057
00:44:31.477 --> 00:44:32.512
Bye.

1058
00:44:48.361 --> 00:44:49.529
Hi.

1059
00:44:49.529 --> 00:44:51.264
Hey.

1060
00:44:52.699 --> 00:44:54.067
-Oh. do you want--
-Yes.

1061
00:44:56.102 --> 00:44:57.270
How was...

1062
00:44:58.538 --> 00:45:00.606
How was your weekend?

1063
00:45:00.606 --> 00:45:01.708
It was good.

1064
00:45:01.708 --> 00:45:04.777
How was--
how was yours?

1065
00:45:04.777 --> 00:45:07.280
Well. I had
a near-death experience.

1066
00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:09.048
but. luckily.

1067
00:45:09.048 --> 00:45:10.550
I was rescued

1068
00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:13.553
by a very swift-moving.
good doctor.

1069
00:45:15.588 --> 00:45:16.923
Looks like he did a good job.

1070
00:45:18.024 --> 00:45:19.025
Yeah.

1071
00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:22.128
You know what...

1072
00:45:22.128 --> 00:45:23.296
when we met.

1073
00:45:23.296 --> 00:45:25.064
we...

1074
00:45:25.064 --> 00:45:26.532
kind of hit it off.

1075
00:45:27.734 --> 00:45:29.736
And now things
are very awkward.

1076
00:45:29.736 --> 00:45:31.637
and I just don't want--

1077
00:45:31.637 --> 00:45:33.439
I don't want this
to affect work and stuff.

1078
00:45:33.439 --> 00:45:34.607
No.

1079
00:45:36.442 --> 00:45:38.211
Thanks for inviting me
to dinner.

1080
00:45:39.579 --> 00:45:41.447
Thank you.

1081
00:45:41.447 --> 00:45:43.716
Wow. this is amazing.

1082
00:45:43.716 --> 00:45:46.285
Well. it may be the boonies.

1083
00:45:46.285 --> 00:45:49.389
but we know how to live well.

1084
00:45:51.057 --> 00:45:52.458
What have you learned
about our flagship store?

1085
00:45:54.761 --> 00:45:56.095
Uh. well...

1086
00:45:56.095 --> 00:45:57.463
morale is incredibly low.

1087
00:45:58.631 --> 00:46:00.433
But there is
this exceptional employee.

1088
00:46:00.433 --> 00:46:01.467
Her name is Maria Mercado.

1089
00:46:01.467 --> 00:46:02.769
She's...

1090
00:46:02.769 --> 00:46:03.836
she's motivated.

1091
00:46:03.836 --> 00:46:05.004
she's responsible.

1092
00:46:05.004 --> 00:46:06.072
she's...

1093
00:46:06.072 --> 00:46:07.507
honestly. everything you want
in a store manager.

1094
00:46:07.507 --> 00:46:09.108
And...

1095
00:46:09.108 --> 00:46:10.843
look. I know that
Ted is your nephew--

1096
00:46:10.843 --> 00:46:12.679
Ted's an idiot.

1097
00:46:12.679 --> 00:46:14.681
but he's family.

1098
00:46:14.681 --> 00:46:15.615
We'll find
something else for him.

1099
00:46:17.317 --> 00:46:20.853
Will all due respect. ma'am.

1100
00:46:20.853 --> 00:46:23.022
it's a much bigger issue
than Cedar Falls.

1101
00:46:25.425 --> 00:46:26.659
When I walk into BuyRite.

1102
00:46:26.659 --> 00:46:27.627
back in San Francisco.

1103
00:46:27.627 --> 00:46:30.330
I feel like I'm walking back
into the '80s.

1104
00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:32.265
The company needs
a serious update.

1105
00:46:32.265 --> 00:46:34.701
It needs new systems.

1106
00:46:34.701 --> 00:46:35.668
new marketing.

1107
00:46:35.668 --> 00:46:37.036
it--

1108
00:46:37.036 --> 00:46:38.137
How did it get this bad?

1109
00:46:39.872 --> 00:46:43.643
My husband didn't always
trust Buck very much.

1110
00:46:43.643 --> 00:46:45.511
But he respected Elizabeth.

1111
00:46:45.511 --> 00:46:47.780
She understood the business.

1112
00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:49.649
shared his desire

1113
00:46:49.649 --> 00:46:52.051
for Rhys and Nate
to run it one day.

1114
00:46:53.386 --> 00:46:55.555
After she died.

1115
00:46:55.555 --> 00:46:56.522
it all fell apart.

1116
00:46:57.824 --> 00:46:59.892
Having the boys here helps.

1117
00:46:59.892 --> 00:47:02.729
but Nate is...

1118
00:47:02.729 --> 00:47:04.297
like his dad.

1119
00:47:05.465 --> 00:47:07.867
He always does better
if he has someone to--

1120
00:47:07.867 --> 00:47:10.303
--help him see the big picture?

1121
00:47:12.138 --> 00:47:13.006
It isn't always easy

1122
00:47:13.006 --> 00:47:14.574
meeting up
to family expectations.

1123
00:47:14.574 --> 00:47:16.542
but...

1124
00:47:16.542 --> 00:47:19.145
you and Nate
would make an effective team.

1125
00:47:21.514 --> 00:47:23.316
If that's what you really want.

1126
00:47:32.025 --> 00:47:32.925
You wanted to see me?

1127
00:47:35.328 --> 00:47:38.865
I hear you've been helping
Riley get the lay of the land.

1128
00:47:38.865 --> 00:47:40.066
Oh. yes. indeed.

1129
00:47:40.066 --> 00:47:41.434
She wants to learn
as much as possible

1130
00:47:41.434 --> 00:47:43.069
about BuyRite.

1131
00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:44.537
Oh. I bet she does.

1132
00:47:45.571 --> 00:47:46.873
Now. listen.

1133
00:47:46.873 --> 00:47:49.275
I need you to do
something for me.

1134
00:47:49.275 --> 00:47:51.077
If you deliver.

1135
00:47:51.077 --> 00:47:53.112
it could be good
for the both of us. hmm?

1136
00:47:54.614 --> 00:47:55.915
Come on.

1137
00:48:02.221 --> 00:48:05.291
So. you want to go around Buck

1138
00:48:05.291 --> 00:48:06.693
and get Faye
to approve your plans?

1139
00:48:06.693 --> 00:48:08.761
He is convinced

1140
00:48:08.761 --> 00:48:10.196
that I'm pretending
to like Nate

1141
00:48:10.196 --> 00:48:13.132
so I can maneuver my way
into the executive suite.

1142
00:48:13.132 --> 00:48:14.000
<i>[Leila laughs]</i>

1143
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.101
Yeah. I know
it looks like that.

1144
00:48:15.101 --> 00:48:16.069
but we both know it's not.

1145
00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:17.570
Where are you?

1146
00:48:17.570 --> 00:48:18.604
<i>At the store.</i>

1147
00:48:18.604 --> 00:48:19.605
<i>The alarm went off.</i>

1148
00:48:19.605 --> 00:48:20.473
<i>Maria said that birds</i>

1149
00:48:20.473 --> 00:48:22.909
have been triggering
the sensor thing.

1150
00:48:22.909 --> 00:48:24.410
so I told Nate
that I'd check it out.

1151
00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:26.245
You can come home. you know.

1152
00:48:26.245 --> 00:48:27.146
You don't have
anything to prove.

1153
00:48:27.146 --> 00:48:28.748
No. that's not it.

1154
00:48:28.748 --> 00:48:30.616
I just need to prove to Faye
that I know what I'm doing.

1155
00:48:32.218 --> 00:48:33.653
It's all locked up. Miss Smith.

1156
00:48:33.653 --> 00:48:35.221
Great.

1157
00:48:35.221 --> 00:48:37.323
Plus. once we get
Cedar Falls up and running.

1158
00:48:37.323 --> 00:48:38.658
we can use it
as a nation-wide model.

1159
00:48:38.658 --> 00:48:39.792
you know?

1160
00:48:39.792 --> 00:48:41.561
<i>And this sales associate.</i>
<i>Maria Mercado?</i>

1161
00:48:41.561 --> 00:48:42.662
She's incredible.

1162
00:48:42.662 --> 00:48:43.830
She's young. she's dedicated.

1163
00:48:43.830 --> 00:48:46.032
She's the perfect image
for the future of the company.

1164
00:48:46.899 --> 00:48:48.101
[thumping]

1165
00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:52.605
Maybe you should
get behind me.

1166
00:48:53.673 --> 00:48:55.174
I... I gotta go.

1167
00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:04.851
[***]

1168
00:49:15.999 --> 00:49:17.834
[Maria]
I feel awful about this.

1169
00:49:20.003 --> 00:49:21.270
Here you go.

1170
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:22.538
Oh. gracias.

1171
00:49:23.873 --> 00:49:25.375
-Have a good night.
-You too.

1172
00:49:25.375 --> 00:49:26.476
Thanks.

1173
00:49:28.311 --> 00:49:31.614
I started working at BuyRite
since high school.

1174
00:49:31.614 --> 00:49:34.384
I was planning to go
to community college.

1175
00:49:34.384 --> 00:49:36.786
but then I got pregnant
with Amalia.

1176
00:49:38.521 --> 00:49:39.622
Did you take maternity leave?

1177
00:49:39.622 --> 00:49:42.125
We don't get maternity.

1178
00:49:42.125 --> 00:49:45.328
They said I could take
two weeks unpaid.

1179
00:49:45.328 --> 00:49:46.629
-What?
-Mm-hmm.

1180
00:49:46.629 --> 00:49:47.830
Any more than that.

1181
00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:49.365
they'd fire me.

1182
00:49:49.365 --> 00:49:52.335
So I took two weeks.

1183
00:49:52.335 --> 00:49:54.570
Do you have any. like.
family that could help out. or?

1184
00:49:56.572 --> 00:49:59.742
Um. we'd been living
with my mom.

1185
00:49:59.742 --> 00:50:01.144
but she died a few months ago.

1186
00:50:04.714 --> 00:50:07.250
I just couldn't keep up
with rent.

1187
00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:08.685
so the landlord threw us out.

1188
00:50:10.053 --> 00:50:11.187
I just--

1189
00:50:11.187 --> 00:50:13.389
I couldn't leave Amalia
in a shelter while I worked.

1190
00:50:14.824 --> 00:50:15.858
Yeah. of course.

1191
00:50:15.858 --> 00:50:17.593
So we moved into the store.

1192
00:50:19.062 --> 00:50:20.163
And it never affected my job.

1193
00:50:21.197 --> 00:50:22.598
It never affected my job.

1194
00:50:22.598 --> 00:50:24.834
I had
a really. really nice neighbor

1195
00:50:24.834 --> 00:50:25.935
who would watch her
during the day.

1196
00:50:27.437 --> 00:50:29.772
And I would work overtime
so I could close up.

1197
00:50:34.243 --> 00:50:36.579
Maria. have you ever
thought about...

1198
00:50:36.579 --> 00:50:38.548
you know.
applying to be a manager?

1199
00:50:38.548 --> 00:50:40.450
You're so good.

1200
00:50:40.450 --> 00:50:42.085
It...

1201
00:50:42.085 --> 00:50:43.419
You just need a college degree.

1202
00:50:43.419 --> 00:50:44.721
Riley...

1203
00:50:44.721 --> 00:50:46.422
I'm gonna share with you

1204
00:50:46.422 --> 00:50:47.757
what my mom's
favorite saying was.

1205
00:50:48.958 --> 00:50:51.394
You can dress a goat in lace.

1206
00:50:51.394 --> 00:50:53.730
but you can't make a silk purse
out of a sow's ear.

1207
00:50:55.765 --> 00:50:56.933
So. what she meant was...

1208
00:50:58.468 --> 00:51:01.070
...don't try and be something
you're not. <i>mi hija.</i>

1209
00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:02.739
Don't aim too high.

1210
00:51:09.078 --> 00:51:12.015
I had such dreams for her.

1211
00:51:14.651 --> 00:51:17.053
I just never thought that
we would end up like this.

1212
00:51:26.496 --> 00:51:28.498
Hi. Can you tell Rhys
I need to talk to him ASAP?

1213
00:51:28.498 --> 00:51:29.732

-Why didn't you tell me?

How mad is she?

1230
00:52:08.838 --> 00:52:11.040
Remember when
you built that volcano.

1231
00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:12.141
and Mom warned you

1232
00:52:12.141 --> 00:52:14.777
not to erupt it
inside the house?

1233
00:52:14.777 --> 00:52:16.879
<i>And ketchup sprayed</i>
<i>all over the good carpet?</i>

1234
00:52:16.879 --> 00:52:18.114
This is worse.

00:52:18.114 --> 00:52:19.148
<i>Much. much worse.</i>

1236
00:52:19.148 --> 00:52:22.018
Dad. I was embarrassed
when Beacon fell through.

1237
00:52:23.119 --> 00:52:24.120
I needed a job.

1238
00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:25.254
and Nate said

1239
00:52:25.254 --> 00:52:26.723
that it would be easier
to bring me into the company

1240
00:52:26.723 --> 00:52:27.790
if we were married.

1241
00:52:27.790 --> 00:52:29.125
So you're just pretending?

1242
00:52:30.226 --> 00:52:31.327
<i>Yeah.</i>

1243
00:52:31.327 --> 00:52:32.562

<i>And now...</i>

1245
00:52:33.496 --> 00:52:36.199
it is not working out
the way I planned.

1246
00:52:36.199 --> 00:52:37.367
And I have no idea what to do.

1247
00:52:38.368 --> 00:52:41.337

any way to fire me.

Riley.

1249
00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:46.476
I've never known you
to back down from a fight.

1250
00:52:48.044 --> 00:52:48.845
Don't start now.

with every plus-size swimsuit

1260
00:53:29.218 --> 00:53:32.555
was a good idea.

1261
00:53:32.555 --> 00:53:35.558
But we should've let customers
sign up for it themselves.

1262
00:53:38.628 --> 00:53:40.063
You try to do something nice...

1263
00:53:42.031 --> 00:53:43.533
I had no idea
she was living in the store.

She's a really good person

1265
00:53:45.935 --> 00:53:47.203
and she's great
at what she does.

1266
00:53:47.203 --> 00:53:49.439
Let me handle it.

1267
00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:53.409
[Emily] ...It may not be enough
to appease to satisfy customers.

1268
00:53:53.409 --> 00:53:55.445
To help deal with the fallout.

1269
00:53:55.445 --> 00:53:57.046
PR's brainstorming options

1270
00:53:57.046 --> 00:53:59.983

00:54:01.250 --> 00:54:04.053
I would never do anything
to harm this company.

1272
00:54:04.053 --> 00:54:06.422
Or this family.

1273
00:54:06.422 --> 00:54:08.124
I believe that.

1274
00:54:08.124 --> 00:54:10.493
[Emily] ...Plus-size options.

1275
00:54:10.493 --> 00:54:12.562
And with that.
I hand it back to you. Buck.

1276
00:54:18.768 --> 00:54:20.670
BuyRite began
as a family company.

1277
00:54:22.138 --> 00:54:24.273
Over the years.
that family grew.

1278
00:54:25.642 --> 00:54:28.011
But it gets real complicated

1279
00:54:28.011 --> 00:54:30.146
when we open the door
to someone who's not kin.

1280
00:54:31.014 --> 00:54:32.248
Now.

1281
00:54:32.248 --> 00:54:34.584
my father taught me

1282
00:54:34.584 --> 00:54:36.919
that the most important quality
in an employee

1283
00:54:36.919 --> 00:54:38.254
is loyalty.

1284
00:54:39.489 --> 00:54:40.623
And it's because of that--

1285
00:54:40.623 --> 00:54:43.826
--we'd like to acknowledge

1286
00:54:43.826 --> 00:54:46.362
the hard work and sacrifice

1287
00:54:46.362 --> 00:54:48.164
of all of you

1288
00:54:48.164 --> 00:54:49.365
who have kept
this business going.

1289
00:54:49.365 --> 00:54:50.500
Mother...

1290
00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:53.870
It won't be easy
to fix what's wrong.

1291
00:54:54.937 --> 00:54:56.673
But Buck and I have faith

1292
00:54:56.673 --> 00:54:58.541
in the next generation
of Bynams.

1293
00:55:00.009 --> 00:55:05.615
Right now. Nate. Riley and Rhys

1294
00:55:05.615 --> 00:55:08.651
are polishing an ambitious plan.

1295
00:55:09.852 --> 00:55:12.889
And we look forward
to unveiling it

1296
00:55:12.889 --> 00:55:14.390
at the next
shareholders' meeting.

1297
00:55:19.195 --> 00:55:20.330
[Buck]
Thank you all for coming.

1298
00:55:20.330 --> 00:55:21.230
That will be it for today.

1299
00:55:25.802 --> 00:55:30.039
[***]

1300
00:55:31.074 --> 00:55:32.241
What just happened?

1301
00:55:32.241 --> 00:55:33.876
I think we got tagged.

1302
00:55:36.746 --> 00:55:37.747
Okay...

1303
00:55:37.747 --> 00:55:38.915
first thing we do

1304
00:55:38.915 --> 00:55:40.350
is we expedite
the architectural plans.

1305
00:55:40.350 --> 00:55:42.685
Let's have them mock up
a 3D rendering for Faye.

1306
00:55:42.685 --> 00:55:43.853
And you should talk to Emily.

1307
00:55:43.853 --> 00:55:46.255
We should run focus groups
to improve customer service.

1308
00:55:46.255 --> 00:55:47.924
Rhys.

1309
00:55:47.924 --> 00:55:49.726
have Demarcus
generate productivity reports

1310
00:55:49.726 --> 00:55:51.194
so we can expand
the departments

1311
00:55:51.194 --> 00:55:52.829
that are yielding
the highest revenue.

1312
00:55:52.829 --> 00:55:54.731
And then I will review
the marketing analytics.

1313
00:55:54.731 --> 00:55:56.599
and then I'll get started
on the mood boards

1314
00:55:56.599 --> 00:55:57.834
for the new aesthetic.

1315
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:02.372
Well. I guess
she's running point.

1316
00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:14.385
[***]

1317
00:56:14.385 --> 00:56:17.221
Okay. so this is just
low-tech spitballing.

1318
00:56:17.221 --> 00:56:19.023
but based off
of Emily's promotional ideas.

1319
00:56:19.023 --> 00:56:22.526
I kind of came up with
some temp print ad ideas.

1320
00:56:23.594 --> 00:56:24.728
This...

1321
00:56:26.196 --> 00:56:27.364
These are really good.

1322
00:56:27.364 --> 00:56:28.999
This could work.

1323
00:56:28.999 --> 00:56:30.067
Yeah.

1324
00:56:30.067 --> 00:56:30.734
[Emily] Buck won't like it.

1325
00:56:32.336 --> 00:56:34.505
Yes. I know rebranding BuyRite

1326
00:56:34.505 --> 00:56:36.840
is like
putting socks on a rooster.

1327
00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:40.511
You've been here too long.

1328
00:56:41.612 --> 00:56:42.680
[Emily] Damn. so have I.

1329
00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:44.615
Andrew must be worried sick.

1330
00:56:46.884 --> 00:56:48.385
Guess we should all head home.

1331
00:56:48.385 --> 00:56:49.420
[Riley] Well. actually. no.

1332
00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:51.855
Rhys and I have
some budget stuff to go over.

1333
00:56:51.855 --> 00:56:53.457
so I'll just meet you.

1334
00:56:56.126 --> 00:56:57.127
All right. yeah.

1335
00:57:05.636 --> 00:57:09.873
[***]

1336
00:57:14.578 --> 00:57:16.413
Hey.

1337
00:57:16.413 --> 00:57:17.815
Thank you.

1338
00:57:19.383 --> 00:57:20.985
You'll need
a cost-benefit analysis

1339
00:57:20.985 --> 00:57:23.120
for that proposal.

1340
00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:24.154
Okay.

1341
00:57:24.154 --> 00:57:26.457
And... what's...

1342
00:57:26.457 --> 00:57:28.158
what's this?

1343
00:57:29.994 --> 00:57:31.228
Oh. um.

1344
00:57:31.228 --> 00:57:32.196
Demarcus and I.

1345
00:57:32.196 --> 00:57:33.497
we mocked up
a management training program.

1346
00:57:34.598 --> 00:57:35.733
You know. something
employees can do

1347
00:57:35.733 --> 00:57:36.734
during their lunch break.

1348
00:57:36.734 --> 00:57:38.002
That's rather ambitious.

1349
00:57:38.002 --> 00:57:40.004
Yeah. well.

1350
00:57:40.004 --> 00:57:41.338
you know. shoot for the fences.

1351
00:57:45.175 --> 00:57:46.577
I'm so tired.

1352
00:57:48.746 --> 00:57:49.747
Can I show you something?

1353
00:57:52.116 --> 00:57:56.120
[***]

1354
00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:58.122
My mom created this

1355
00:57:58.122 --> 00:58:01.091
as a place for employees
to escape after a long day.

1356
00:58:02.459 --> 00:58:04.128
I come up here to think a lot.

1357
00:58:05.496 --> 00:58:06.830
Smart woman.

1358
00:58:09.433 --> 00:58:10.668
It's quite the view.

1359
00:58:11.702 --> 00:58:13.337
Yeah.

1360
00:58:13.337 --> 00:58:15.372
Daniel used to teach me
about the constellations.

1361
00:58:17.007 --> 00:58:18.542
I wish he was here.

1362
00:58:19.843 --> 00:58:21.145
But. you know. I think
he'd be really proud

1363
00:58:21.145 --> 00:58:22.212
of what we're doing.

1364
00:58:23.514 --> 00:58:24.615
Yeah.

1365
00:58:26.817 --> 00:58:31.121
Look. Riley...

1366
00:58:31.121 --> 00:58:33.524
I know you mean well.

1367
00:58:33.524 --> 00:58:36.827
but this company--
it's a sinking ship.

1368
00:58:36.827 --> 00:58:39.396
You--you can't save it.

1369
00:58:41.131 --> 00:58:43.801
So what you've been doing
is just humoring me?

1370
00:58:43.801 --> 00:58:46.170
No. I'm supporting you.

1371
00:58:46.170 --> 00:58:48.372
I just don't want to see you
get your hopes up on this.

1372
00:58:50.074 --> 00:58:51.141
Okay.

1373
00:58:52.242 --> 00:58:53.544
Hmm.

1374
00:58:53.544 --> 00:58:55.245
You know. you can't
shut the world out

1375
00:58:55.245 --> 00:58:56.347
just because
things didn't work out

1376
00:58:56.347 --> 00:58:57.247
the way you planned. right?

1377
00:58:58.749 --> 00:59:00.351
I actually did
my research on you.

1378
00:59:00.351 --> 00:59:02.853
and when you started
your company.

1379
00:59:02.853 --> 00:59:04.221
the housing market
was out of control.

1380
00:59:04.221 --> 00:59:05.656
so you bought old buildings

1381
00:59:05.656 --> 00:59:06.957
and you turned them
into apartments

1382
00:59:06.957 --> 00:59:09.426
so that your employees could
have more affordable housing.

1383
00:59:09.426 --> 00:59:12.262
That was
purely a business decision.

1384
00:59:12.262 --> 00:59:13.364
Exactly.

1385
00:59:13.364 --> 00:59:15.499
Because you know good ethics
makes for good business.

1386
00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:18.002
I'm assuming
that your mom taught you that.

1387
00:59:20.537 --> 00:59:21.639
It is clear

1388
00:59:21.639 --> 00:59:23.574
that she put her heart and soul
into this company.

1389
00:59:23.574 --> 00:59:24.842
and that is why you came back.

1390
00:59:25.976 --> 00:59:27.378
Would you want her
to see you like this.

1391
00:59:27.378 --> 00:59:28.879
just counting down the days
until you're done?

1392
00:59:30.781 --> 00:59:33.083
And pretending
like you don't care

1393
00:59:33.083 --> 00:59:34.551
about...

1394
00:59:35.586 --> 00:59:36.787
...anything?

1395
00:59:43.994 --> 00:59:48.032
[***]

1396
00:59:52.469 --> 00:59:53.637
Riley?

1397
00:59:53.637 --> 00:59:55.239
Riley...

1398
00:59:57.374 --> 01:00:01.245
[***]

1399
01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:08.118
Oh. crap.

1400
01:00:13.724 --> 01:00:18.228
[***]

1401
01:00:26.937 --> 01:00:30.607
[***]

1402
01:00:44.121 --> 01:00:49.093
[***]

1403
01:00:52.596 --> 01:00:53.964
This all you got?

1404
01:00:53.964 --> 01:00:55.132
Well. I'm still working on it.

1405
01:00:55.132 --> 01:00:56.700
Well. work faster.

1406
01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:58.502
I want her outta here
as soon as possible.

1407
01:01:02.373 --> 01:01:06.010
[singing]
* Happy birthday to you

1408
01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:11.148
* Happy birthday. dear Mama
* ...Auntie Faye

1409
01:01:11.148 --> 01:01:16.520
* Happy birthday to you

1410
01:01:17.855 --> 01:01:20.624
Thank you!
It's beautiful.

1411
01:01:20.624 --> 01:01:21.725
Looks like you're gonna need

1412
01:01:21.725 --> 01:01:23.360
a bigger cake
next year. Grandma.

1413
01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:25.329
There's a distinct possibility.

1414
01:01:25.329 --> 01:01:27.331
but as long as I'm still here.

1415
01:01:27.331 --> 01:01:28.832
I can cut my own cake.

1416
01:01:28.832 --> 01:01:30.200
Thank you.

1417
01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:32.303
[Nate] Let me take
the sparklers.

1418
01:01:33.737 --> 01:01:35.172
[Buck] Don't burn your fingers.

1419
01:01:38.208 --> 01:01:39.209
How about a big. old
corner piece

1420
01:01:39.209 --> 01:01:40.711
for your favorite nephew?

1421
01:01:41.645 --> 01:01:43.480
You're my only nephew. Ted.

1422
01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:51.422
[Riley] Hey.

1423
01:01:53.223 --> 01:01:54.692
Did you think
I wouldn't find out?

1424
01:01:56.727 --> 01:01:58.062
Uh. what?

1425
01:01:58.062 --> 01:02:00.331
You tricked
Nate into marrying you.

1426
01:02:00.331 --> 01:02:01.665
You're just after his money.

1427
01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:04.201
[Riley] That's...

1428
01:02:04.201 --> 01:02:05.602
that's not true.

1429
01:02:05.602 --> 01:02:07.271
I just don't get
why he fell for it.

1430
01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:11.342
You're not exactly his type.

1431
01:02:14.178 --> 01:02:15.179
What's going on?

1432
01:02:16.513 --> 01:02:17.681
This little gold-digger--

1433
01:02:17.681 --> 01:02:19.850
she's not only flat-broke.

1434
01:02:19.850 --> 01:02:21.018
she's deep in debt.

1435
01:02:22.119 --> 01:02:25.356
Her folks
don't even own their home.

1436
01:02:27.458 --> 01:02:31.395
[***]

1437
01:02:41.305 --> 01:02:42.306
Riley.

1438
01:02:42.306 --> 01:02:43.774
Riley...

1439
01:02:48.212 --> 01:02:52.283
[***]

1440
01:02:54.718 --> 01:02:55.819
Riley.

1441
01:02:55.819 --> 01:02:57.254
He's talking about my family.

1442
01:02:57.254 --> 01:02:59.323
Being in debt.

1443
01:02:59.323 --> 01:03:01.592
You know that I have
an MBA from Stanford?

1444
01:03:01.592 --> 01:03:02.826
I have a degree from Berkeley.

1445
01:03:02.826 --> 01:03:04.995
and he's talking about me
like I am trash.

1446
01:03:04.995 --> 01:03:07.298
This isn't about
the money. Riley.

1447
01:03:07.298 --> 01:03:08.532
It's not about the money?

1448
01:03:08.532 --> 01:03:10.234
What are you talking about?
Of course. it's about the money.

1449
01:03:10.234 --> 01:03:12.002
No. He's afraid of you.

1450
01:03:12.002 --> 01:03:13.671
[laughs] Okay.

1451
01:03:13.671 --> 01:03:15.005
Riley. he's afraid

1452
01:03:15.005 --> 01:03:17.241
that my grandma's
going to like your ideas.

1453
01:03:17.241 --> 01:03:18.642
That--that the Board

1454
01:03:18.642 --> 01:03:20.678
is going
to lose confidence in him

1455
01:03:20.678 --> 01:03:21.745
and force him out.

1456
01:03:21.745 --> 01:03:23.681
The Board thinks I am a nobody.

1457
01:03:23.681 --> 01:03:24.415
They don't care about
what I have to say.

1458
01:03:24.415 --> 01:03:26.750
They don't care.
They don't care!

1459
01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:28.652
They care. Riley. because
you have a seat at the table.

1460
01:03:28.652 --> 01:03:31.755
As Nate's wife.
you get a share of the company.

1461
01:03:34.358 --> 01:03:38.028
[***]

1462
01:03:38.028 --> 01:03:39.496
Look...

1463
01:03:39.496 --> 01:03:40.230
the other night. I...

1464
01:03:42.866 --> 01:03:44.668
Yeah. I shouldn't
have kissed you.

1465
01:03:46.103 --> 01:03:47.604
Sorry. I...

1466
01:03:50.174 --> 01:03:51.875
You're the only person
since my mom...

1467
01:03:54.044 --> 01:03:55.346
...that can actually
make a change.

1468
01:03:58.616 --> 01:03:59.717
We need you here.

1469
01:04:01.885 --> 01:04:03.187
I need you here.

1470
01:04:06.557 --> 01:04:10.361
[***]

1471
01:04:26.369 --> 01:04:28.671
based on our most recent
revenue reports.

1472
01:04:28.671 --> 01:04:30.139
we restructure
the stores' layout.

1473
01:04:30.139 --> 01:04:31.540
making the most successful
departments

1474
01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:32.842
the easiest to access.

1475
01:04:32.842 --> 01:04:35.444
We also rebranded
the grocery department.

1476
01:04:35.444 --> 01:04:37.613
making it more modern
and customer-friendly.

1477
01:04:37.613 --> 01:04:40.516
with a wide variety
of fresh fruits and vegetables.

1478
01:04:40.516 --> 01:04:43.319
and also a designated area
for ready-to-go meals

1479
01:04:43.319 --> 01:04:44.553
for our busy shoppers.

1480
01:04:44.553 --> 01:04:46.889
Another feature of our rebrand

1481
01:04:46.889 --> 01:04:49.892
is the reboot of our displays
and our color palette.

1482
01:04:49.892 --> 01:04:51.794
You know. we want
our customers to see

1483
01:04:51.794 --> 01:04:53.496
that there's been a real change
here at BuyRite.

1484
01:04:53.496 --> 01:04:54.664
So. as you can see.

1485
01:04:54.664 --> 01:04:55.898
the most requested improvements

1486
01:04:55.898 --> 01:04:57.733
are flexible returns.

1487
01:04:57.733 --> 01:04:58.701
scan-and-go checkout.

1488
01:04:58.701 --> 01:05:00.036
and curbside pick-up.

1489
01:05:00.036 --> 01:05:02.338
But. at the end of the day.

1490
01:05:02.338 --> 01:05:05.508
BuyRite's biggest strength
is our consumer loyalty.

1491
01:05:05.508 --> 01:05:06.542
Online surveys show

1492
01:05:06.542 --> 01:05:09.011
that 68% of customers

1493
01:05:09.011 --> 01:05:10.513
have been shopping at BuyRite
for over 20 years.

1494
01:05:10.513 --> 01:05:13.683
So. as my mom always says.

1495
01:05:13.683 --> 01:05:15.251
in any good relationship.

1496
01:05:15.251 --> 01:05:17.720
it's important
to spice things up.

1497
01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:19.188
remind them
why they keep coming back.

1498
01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:26.228
Very nice.

1499
01:05:28.264 --> 01:05:30.833
[applause]

1500
01:05:33.269 --> 01:05:35.705
[Riley] And tomorrow.
we'll walk through the store.

1501
01:05:44.513 --> 01:05:47.683
And behold our fabulous.
new produce section.

1502
01:05:53.756 --> 01:05:54.790
Now. these new shelves

1503
01:05:54.790 --> 01:05:56.225
have barcode scanners

1504
01:05:56.225 --> 01:05:58.561
that gauge when supplies
are running low.

1505
01:05:58.561 --> 01:06:01.864
then they notify the associates
via an app on their phone.

1506
01:06:01.864 --> 01:06:03.099
Ted?

1507
01:06:04.634 --> 01:06:06.035
And when these changes
go through.

1508
01:06:06.035 --> 01:06:07.169
these smart carts

1509
01:06:07.169 --> 01:06:08.971
will allow customers
to upload their shopping lists.

1510
01:06:08.971 --> 01:06:10.139
The wireless system

1511
01:06:10.139 --> 01:06:12.308
tracks every item
placed in the cart.

1512
01:06:12.308 --> 01:06:14.310
then allows customers
to pay for it directly.

1513
01:06:14.310 --> 01:06:16.412
this reducing
lines at check-out.

1514
01:06:16.412 --> 01:06:17.747
Plus. they recommend
additional items

1515
01:06:17.747 --> 01:06:18.547
to customers.

1516
01:06:18.547 --> 01:06:20.616
which increases purchases
by 20%.

1517
01:06:20.616 --> 01:06:22.318
[Emily] And to pay for it.

1518
01:06:22.318 --> 01:06:24.420
we've partnered with
a number of national brands

1519
01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:25.988
whose products
appear on the screen

1520
01:06:25.988 --> 01:06:27.790
as shoppers
move down each aisle.

1521
01:06:31.327 --> 01:06:32.395
So we've updated our breakroom.

1522
01:06:32.395 --> 01:06:35.398
giving employees more reason
to eat lunch there.

1523
01:06:35.398 --> 01:06:36.899
which increases productivity.

1524
01:06:36.899 --> 01:06:39.735
And we've expanded
our management training.

1525
01:06:39.735 --> 01:06:41.837
creating the Elizabeth Fisher
Scholarships.

1526
01:06:41.837 --> 01:06:44.006
so promising part-timers
can finish college

1527
01:06:44.006 --> 01:06:45.341
and become team leaders.

1528
01:06:45.341 --> 01:06:46.676
And because we want
our employees

1529
01:06:46.676 --> 01:06:47.777
to be able to take care
of their families.

1530
01:06:47.777 --> 01:06:49.745
we're going to help subsidize
the cost of daycare.

1531
01:06:50.813 --> 01:06:51.914
[Buck] We can't do that.

1532
01:06:51.914 --> 01:06:53.916
It'll bankrupt us.

1533
01:06:53.916 --> 01:06:57.453
Too much of our budget
goes to recruiting new hires.

1534
01:06:57.453 --> 01:06:58.487
And research shows

1535
01:06:58.487 --> 01:06:59.822
that affordable childcare

1536
01:06:59.822 --> 01:07:01.524
results in
lower employee turnover.

1537
01:07:01.524 --> 01:07:04.360
Very admirable.

1538
01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:06.095
Screw admirable.

1539
01:07:06.095 --> 01:07:08.164
Mama. do you have any idea
how much that will cost?

1540
01:07:08.164 --> 01:07:10.299
Well. some of it will be offset
by the free publicity we'll get.

1541
01:07:11.968 --> 01:07:13.202
Emily's put together
a nationwide campaign.

1542
01:07:14.270 --> 01:07:15.638
Live Right. BuyRite.

1543
01:07:15.638 --> 01:07:17.340
[Riley]
People want to feel good

1544
01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:19.175
about the purchases
they're making.

1545
01:07:19.175 --> 01:07:20.977
and that loyalty
is passed on to their children.

1546
01:07:20.977 --> 01:07:22.845
So you're really going
to indulge them

1547
01:07:22.845 --> 01:07:24.847
in this bleeding-heart crap?

1548
01:07:26.182 --> 01:07:28.484
[Riley] Launching BuyRite
required a big leap of faith.

1549
01:07:29.719 --> 01:07:31.787
And we are asking you
to do that again--

1550
01:07:31.787 --> 01:07:34.557
trust us to win over
the trust of the new generation.

1551
01:07:39.061 --> 01:07:42.632
An excellent execution
of a plan.

1552
01:07:42.632 --> 01:07:45.067
Well done. everyone!

1553
01:07:45.067 --> 01:07:46.569
[applause]

1554
01:07:59.215 --> 01:08:00.349
Uh-uh-uh-uh!

1555
01:08:00.349 --> 01:08:01.684
What the hell was that?

1556
01:08:02.818 --> 01:08:03.853
What? You didn't like it?

1557
01:08:04.854 --> 01:08:06.555
We agreed.

1558
01:08:06.555 --> 01:08:08.858
You were going
to sabotage them.

1559
01:08:10.326 --> 01:08:11.260
I paid you plenty.

1560
01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:14.363
Yes. you did.

1561
01:08:14.363 --> 01:08:15.698
But Rhys paid me more.

1562
01:08:21.237 --> 01:08:22.338
[chuckles]

1563
01:08:22.338 --> 01:08:23.739
Oh. yeah?

1564
01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:26.275
Chip off the old block.

1565
01:08:34.617 --> 01:08:35.985
They loved it.

1566
01:08:35.985 --> 01:08:37.787
<i>Oh. Riley.</i>
<i>I'm so proud of you.</i>

1567
01:08:38.988 --> 01:08:41.457
<i>You haven't talked</i>
<i>to Rhys yet?</i>

1568
01:08:41.457 --> 01:08:42.858
I don't know
if there's any point.

1569
01:08:44.593 --> 01:08:46.028
He's convinced himself
he doesn't care.

1570
01:08:46.028 --> 01:08:47.196
<i>But you think he does?</i>

1571
01:08:47.196 --> 01:08:49.532
I know it sounds corny.

1572
01:08:49.532 --> 01:08:50.800
but I really do believe

1573
01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:54.103
that true love
is your soul's recognition

1574
01:08:54.103 --> 01:08:55.371
of its counterpoint in another.

1575
01:08:55.371 --> 01:08:56.572
<i>Emily Dickinson?</i>

1576
01:08:56.572 --> 01:08:57.540
<i>Wedding Crashers.</i>

1577
01:08:59.108 --> 01:09:00.142
I should go.

1578
01:09:00.142 --> 01:09:01.310
Nate's taking me to dinner
at the country club.

1579
01:09:01.310 --> 01:09:02.812
<i>Oh!</i>

1580
01:09:02.812 --> 01:09:03.946
<i>Okay.</i>

1581
01:09:03.946 --> 01:09:05.948
<i>-Try to have fun.</i>
-Yes.

1582
01:09:05.948 --> 01:09:06.949
Oh. Hey.

1583
01:09:08.718 --> 01:09:10.620
You're in love
with my grandson. aren't you?

1584
01:09:12.488 --> 01:09:14.056
Just not the one
you're married to.

1585
01:09:14.991 --> 01:09:16.292
Uh...

1586
01:09:18.661 --> 01:09:21.631
You do know that
as long as you're with Nate.

1587
01:09:21.631 --> 01:09:23.766
he won't admit his feelings.

1588
01:09:28.838 --> 01:09:31.974
[***]

1589
01:09:41.684 --> 01:09:44.654
you brought me as your guest
to make Emily jealous. right?

1590
01:09:44.654 --> 01:09:45.888
No.

1591
01:09:45.888 --> 01:09:47.223
Really?

1592
01:09:47.223 --> 01:09:48.524
You didn't want
to make her angry

1593
01:09:48.524 --> 01:09:50.059
so she'd come crawling back?

1594
01:09:50.059 --> 01:09:50.993
Okay. maybe.

1595
01:09:50.993 --> 01:09:52.361
but. look.

1596
01:09:52.361 --> 01:09:54.530
she doesn't love me
anymore. so.

1597
01:09:54.530 --> 01:09:55.531
Are you sure about that?

1598
01:09:57.867 --> 01:09:59.535
Surprise!

1599
01:10:00.569 --> 01:10:01.570
[applause]

1600
01:10:01.570 --> 01:10:02.705
Wasn't me.

1601
01:10:02.705 --> 01:10:03.873
What?

1602
01:10:03.873 --> 01:10:05.374
Rhys thought of it.

1603
01:10:06.542 --> 01:10:09.679
Since you never had
a proper reception.

1604
01:10:12.815 --> 01:10:14.016
Enjoy yourself.

1605
01:10:14.016 --> 01:10:15.184
Thank you.

1606
01:10:16.819 --> 01:10:18.754
Faye looks about as happy
as a tick on a fat dog.

1607
01:10:20.890 --> 01:10:22.325
Come here.

1608
01:10:22.325 --> 01:10:23.259
-Oh.
-Come on.

1609
01:10:25.161 --> 01:10:26.329
Well...

1610
01:10:26.329 --> 01:10:27.496
there's no predictin'

1611
01:10:27.496 --> 01:10:30.166
whether this strategy of yours
is gonna work nationwide.

1612
01:10:30.166 --> 01:10:31.867
Well. I guess
we'll have to wait and see.

1613
01:10:36.439 --> 01:10:38.708
* ...What time it is
I don't care *

1614
01:10:38.708 --> 01:10:42.345
* When you're runnin'
your fingers through my hair *

1615
01:10:42.345 --> 01:10:44.013
* So let's let
our love go on... *

1616
01:10:44.013 --> 01:10:45.748
Em.

1617
01:10:45.748 --> 01:10:47.950
[Winnie] Hey. you two!
Say "flamingo"!

1618
01:10:49.552 --> 01:10:50.953
-Flamingo!
-Flamingo!

1619
01:10:52.688 --> 01:10:53.689
[sobs happily]

1620
01:10:58.694 --> 01:11:00.262
You didn't have to do this.
Thank you.

1621
01:11:01.530 --> 01:11:03.232
We are not done yet.

1622
01:11:06.535 --> 01:11:08.037
Mom! Dad!

1623
01:11:09.639 --> 01:11:11.040
-You guys are here!
-Hi. sweetheart!

1624
01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:12.041
How are you?

1625
01:11:14.377 --> 01:11:16.479
Hi!

1626
01:11:16.479 --> 01:11:17.647
Um. this is...

1627
01:11:17.647 --> 01:11:20.616
Well. this is Nate.

1628
01:11:20.616 --> 01:11:22.551
-Oh! Hi. Nate!
-Hi.

1629
01:11:22.551 --> 01:11:24.487
-Nice to meet you. Nate.
-Nice to meet you. too.

1630
01:11:26.155 --> 01:11:27.657
[Riley] I'm... I...

1631
01:11:29.025 --> 01:11:30.459
I'm sorry
that I didn't tell you.

1632
01:11:30.459 --> 01:11:31.527
I just...

1633
01:11:31.527 --> 01:11:34.463
You know. I didn't want you
to be disappointed.

1634
01:11:34.463 --> 01:11:37.400
We're not disappointed.
we're just surprised.

1635
01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:38.601
Me too.
This is a surprise.

1636
01:11:38.601 --> 01:11:40.903
Rhys flew us first-class--

1637
01:11:40.903 --> 01:11:41.771
with fresh-baked cookies.

1638
01:11:41.771 --> 01:11:43.940
We wanted to join
the mile-high club--

1639
01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:46.242
But we decided to wait
till we got to the hotel.

1640
01:11:46.242 --> 01:11:48.044
[Mom] A suite. no less!

1641
01:11:48.044 --> 01:11:50.746
* With a Jacuzzi!

1642
01:11:50.746 --> 01:11:51.580
All those bubbles!

1643
01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:53.149
[Riley] Okay!
Thank you for that.

1644
01:11:53.149 --> 01:11:55.751
Oh. I've missed
our little chats.

1645
01:11:55.751 --> 01:11:57.286
Why don't I get us a drink?

1646
01:11:57.286 --> 01:11:58.921
-Yes. Great.
-Let's do it.

1647
01:12:02.758 --> 01:12:03.993
Enjoy.

1648
01:12:05.995 --> 01:12:09.999
[***]

1649
01:12:11.867 --> 01:12:13.002
I'm...

1650
01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:15.605
I'm so happy you're here.

1651
01:12:17.607 --> 01:12:20.276
Yeah. it was really sweet of
Rhys to do all of this for you.

1652
01:12:21.444 --> 01:12:22.678
Yeah. it is.

1653
01:12:29.218 --> 01:12:30.653
You know. my parents
didn't want me

1654
01:12:30.653 --> 01:12:32.555
to follow your father
to San Francisco.

1655
01:12:32.555 --> 01:12:34.357
For months. they wouldn't even
use his name.

1656
01:12:34.357 --> 01:12:36.192
they just calling him "Him".

1657
01:12:37.293 --> 01:12:39.362
Really?

1658
01:12:39.362 --> 01:12:40.863
They thought
I was making a big mistake.

1659
01:12:42.131 --> 01:12:43.199
But I went anyway.

1660
01:12:44.233 --> 01:12:45.167
Because I loved him.

1661
01:12:48.037 --> 01:12:49.872
And right after
I got accepted to med school.

1662
01:12:49.872 --> 01:12:51.073
I got pregnant with Daniel.

1663
01:12:51.073 --> 01:12:52.308
So I put it off.

1664
01:12:53.709 --> 01:12:54.644
And by the time you came.

1665
01:12:54.644 --> 01:12:56.679
it was too far out of reach.

1666
01:12:58.347 --> 01:13:00.383
Why didn't you tell me?

1667
01:13:00.383 --> 01:13:01.484
Because it was my choice.

1668
01:13:02.351 --> 01:13:04.487
I had a good job.

1669
01:13:04.487 --> 01:13:06.489
a good marriage.

1670
01:13:06.489 --> 01:13:07.757
and two healthy children.

1671
01:13:08.824 --> 01:13:09.759
That's what mattered.

1672
01:13:11.861 --> 01:13:13.062
Honey. I'm proud of you.

1673
01:13:14.730 --> 01:13:15.998
But I can't watch you
lie to yourself.

1674
01:13:17.266 --> 01:13:18.668
Not about something
this important.

1675
01:13:19.702 --> 01:13:21.170
Trust me.
I'm your mother.

1676
01:13:21.170 --> 01:13:22.905
and I love you.

1677
01:13:25.007 --> 01:13:26.342
Come here.

1678
01:13:31.547 --> 01:13:35.551
[***]

1679
01:13:40.289 --> 01:13:41.457
Hey.

1680
01:13:41.457 --> 01:13:43.125
-You guys having a good time?
-Yes!

1681
01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:45.761
Yeah.

1682
01:13:46.696 --> 01:13:48.030
Oh. your father and I

1683
01:13:48.030 --> 01:13:49.598
are going to take
a spin on the dance floor.

1684
01:13:49.598 --> 01:13:51.367
-Oh! Oh. yes.
-Mm-hmm.

1685
01:13:51.367 --> 01:13:53.235
-Yes. I promised her a dance.
-That's right.

1686
01:13:53.235 --> 01:13:54.270
On the dance floor.
Over here.

1687
01:13:55.538 --> 01:13:56.739
Have fun.

1688
01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:00.276
You made quite the impression
on my mother.

1689
01:14:01.777 --> 01:14:03.446
She can never fly
Economy Plus again.

1690
01:14:03.446 --> 01:14:04.647
Thank you.

1691
01:14:09.986 --> 01:14:11.420
And...

1692
01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:12.655
you know. thank you for...

1693
01:14:12.655 --> 01:14:13.823
all of this.

1694
01:14:14.991 --> 01:14:16.459
Really...

1695
01:14:16.459 --> 01:14:17.593
really nice.

1696
01:14:17.593 --> 01:14:20.429
It's the least we can do
to welcome you to the family.

1697
01:14:25.134 --> 01:14:27.003
Actually.
I wanted to tell you something.

1698
01:14:27.003 --> 01:14:28.237
[Faye] Check. check.

1699
01:14:29.272 --> 01:14:31.807
Ladies and gentlemen.

1700
01:14:31.807 --> 01:14:37.079
I think it's time
to toast the happy couple.

1701
01:14:37.079 --> 01:14:38.347
Oh. my god.

1702
01:14:40.016 --> 01:14:41.017
[Faye] Riley.

1703
01:14:41.017 --> 01:14:43.519
-Riley.
-[Riley] That's okay.

1704
01:14:45.521 --> 01:14:46.822
Here you go. sweetheart.

1705
01:14:46.822 --> 01:14:48.090
Here you go.

1706
01:14:48.090 --> 01:14:49.158
Hey.

1707
01:14:49.158 --> 01:14:50.159
Oh.

1708
01:14:52.028 --> 01:14:54.330
Um. hi. everybody.

1709
01:14:54.330 --> 01:14:56.198
Thank you guys for being here.

1710
01:14:56.198 --> 01:14:57.466
[man] Speech!

1711
01:14:57.466 --> 01:14:58.834
[Riley] Okay. yeah. speech.

1712
01:14:58.834 --> 01:14:59.869
You know.

1713
01:14:59.869 --> 01:15:02.705
my dad always says.

1714
01:15:02.705 --> 01:15:05.841
"Family is where life starts
and love never ends."

1715
01:15:07.543 --> 01:15:09.779
He probably got it
off of a meme.

1716
01:15:09.779 --> 01:15:11.781
He spends way too much time
on Instagram.

1717
01:15:13.549 --> 01:15:15.318
Um. but it's true.

1718
01:15:17.019 --> 01:15:18.454
I'm really lucky to have
parents who care about me.

1719
01:15:18.454 --> 01:15:21.157
Even when they expect
a lot from me...

1720
01:15:22.191 --> 01:15:23.693
...I still feel their love.

1721
01:15:24.827 --> 01:15:27.330
And I'm so grateful

1722
01:15:27.330 --> 01:15:29.632
to be embraced
by this new family.

1723
01:15:34.236 --> 01:15:35.504
And I...

1724
01:15:37.173 --> 01:15:38.574
There's just...

1725
01:15:39.742 --> 01:15:41.811
I haven't been
completely honest with you guys.

1726
01:15:43.746 --> 01:15:45.381
Or myself. really.

1727
01:15:45.381 --> 01:15:47.249
And there's something
that I wanted to say.

1728
01:15:47.249 --> 01:15:48.551
Yeah. so I--

1729
01:15:48.551 --> 01:15:50.052
Emily.

1730
01:15:52.154 --> 01:15:53.589
It's you.

1731
01:15:53.589 --> 01:15:55.191
It's always been you.

1732
01:15:56.359 --> 01:15:58.160
This thing with Riley.
it was a mistake.

1733
01:15:58.160 --> 01:15:59.095
We were drunk.

1734
01:15:59.095 --> 01:16:00.696
we didn't even realize
what we were doing

1735
01:16:00.696 --> 01:16:02.031
'til it was too late.

1736
01:16:03.499 --> 01:16:04.567
I'm sorry. Emily.

1737
01:16:07.603 --> 01:16:09.438
I was a fool.

1738
01:16:09.438 --> 01:16:10.706
When you left me for Andrew.
I was afraid--

1739
01:16:10.706 --> 01:16:11.807
You're right.

1740
01:16:13.142 --> 01:16:14.477
You are a fool.

1741
01:16:15.978 --> 01:16:16.979
I broke up with Andrew
weeks ago.

1742
01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:19.148
You did?

1743
01:16:21.984 --> 01:16:23.119
I love you so much.

1744
01:16:23.119 --> 01:16:24.120
I love you. too.

1745
01:16:29.325 --> 01:16:31.093
How could you do this to Riley?
After everything she's done!

1746
01:16:31.093 --> 01:16:32.428
Hey. hey. Wait. wait.
No. no. stop.

1747
01:16:32.428 --> 01:16:34.163
I know that he doesn't love me.
It's okay.

1748
01:16:34.163 --> 01:16:35.231
You do?

1749
01:16:36.632 --> 01:16:37.767
Yeah.

1750
01:16:37.767 --> 01:16:38.801
I don't love him either.

1751
01:16:40.169 --> 01:16:41.270
So this was just...

1752
01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:42.505
a big joke?

1753
01:16:42.505 --> 01:16:43.472
Nate's my friend.

1754
01:16:43.472 --> 01:16:45.107
A big game?

1755
01:16:46.642 --> 01:16:48.110
No. This is
what I was trying to tell you.

1756
01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:49.412
You don't understand--

1757
01:16:49.412 --> 01:16:50.413
No. you know what.

1758
01:16:50.413 --> 01:16:53.149
I understand that
the more time I spend here.

1759
01:16:53.149 --> 01:16:54.450
I remember why I left.

1760
01:16:55.851 --> 01:16:57.019
Rhys. wait. Wait!

1761
01:16:58.087 --> 01:16:59.155
[Faye moaning]

1762
01:17:03.159 --> 01:17:04.493
[Faye moaning]

1763
01:17:14.359 --> 01:17:15.760
Yeah. Nate said
Faye's doing better.

1764
01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:17.262
so that's...

1765
01:17:17.262 --> 01:17:18.330
[sighs]

1766
01:17:18.330 --> 01:17:19.864
...that's good.

1767
01:17:21.032 --> 01:17:23.535
The doctors. they agreed
to private home care.

1768
01:17:23.535 --> 01:17:26.538
Um. but she could be...

1769
01:17:26.538 --> 01:17:28.039
convalescing for a while.

1770
01:17:29.207 --> 01:17:30.675
[Mom] <i>Sounds like</i>
<i>she'll be okay.</i>

1771
01:17:30.675 --> 01:17:32.711
<i>Have you heard from Rhys?</i>

1772
01:17:32.711 --> 01:17:35.213
Um...

1773
01:17:35.213 --> 01:17:36.548
no.

1774
01:17:39.584 --> 01:17:43.855
[***]

1775
01:17:48.627 --> 01:17:49.761
-Hi!
-Riley!

1776
01:17:51.997 --> 01:17:52.897
I got you something.

1777
01:18:02.307 --> 01:18:03.408
Thank you. Riley!

1778
01:18:03.408 --> 01:18:04.476
You're welcome. sweetheart.

1779
01:18:08.813 --> 01:18:09.948
What's this?

1780
01:18:09.948 --> 01:18:11.650
Just something
to get you started.

1781
01:18:13.318 --> 01:18:14.719
[chuckles]

1782
01:18:18.290 --> 01:18:21.726
[***]

1783
01:18:23.995 --> 01:18:25.163
Gracias!

1784
01:18:25.163 --> 01:18:26.464
You're welcome.

1785
01:18:30.135 --> 01:18:33.605
[***]

1786
01:18:39.144 --> 01:18:40.745
[moans]

1787
01:18:46.017 --> 01:18:47.252
-Hey.
-Hey.

1788
01:18:47.252 --> 01:18:48.987
How is she?

1789
01:18:48.987 --> 01:18:50.322
She's drifting in and out.

1790
01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:52.991
Is that Riley?

1791
01:18:52.991 --> 01:18:54.159
Hi!

1792
01:18:54.159 --> 01:18:56.127
Are you leaving?

1793
01:18:56.127 --> 01:18:57.262
Yeah.

1794
01:18:57.262 --> 01:18:58.430
Are you insane?

1795
01:19:00.165 --> 01:19:02.267
-Grandma! Not again!
-She's done this before?

1796
01:19:02.267 --> 01:19:03.301
Many times.

1797
01:19:03.301 --> 01:19:06.004
Well. someone has to knock
some sense into you!

1798
01:19:06.004 --> 01:19:07.472
Auntie Faye--

1799
01:19:07.472 --> 01:19:08.607
you're okay?

1800
01:19:10.008 --> 01:19:11.142
Ted...

1801
01:19:11.142 --> 01:19:12.344
make yourself useful

1802
01:19:12.344 --> 01:19:14.546
and get me
a bourbon on the rocks.

1803
01:19:14.546 --> 01:19:15.547
Yes. ma'am.

1804
01:19:15.547 --> 01:19:18.283
And as for you--

1805
01:19:18.283 --> 01:19:19.317
where I come from.

1806
01:19:19.317 --> 01:19:22.687
we fight for what we want.

1807
01:19:22.687 --> 01:19:25.557
Not run away from it
with our tail between our legs.

1808
01:19:25.557 --> 01:19:27.325
[Riley] I--

1809
01:19:27.325 --> 01:19:29.828
Rhys doesn't want
anything to do with me. so.

1810
01:19:29.828 --> 01:19:33.198
He doesn't know what he wants.

1811
01:19:33.198 --> 01:19:36.635
He's too busy
running away from this town.

1812
01:19:36.635 --> 01:19:37.802
this family.

1813
01:19:37.802 --> 01:19:40.505
He needs something--

1814
01:19:40.505 --> 01:19:43.008
someone to believe in.

1815
01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:47.012
I don't know
where I'd find him.

1816
01:19:48.346 --> 01:19:49.347
You know.

1817
01:19:50.982 --> 01:19:51.983
What are you waiting for?

1818
01:19:53.018 --> 01:19:54.052
Go find him!

1819
01:19:54.052 --> 01:19:55.987
Really?

1820
01:19:55.987 --> 01:19:56.788
You heard her.

1821
01:19:56.788 --> 01:19:58.390
What are you waiting for?
Go find him.

1822
01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:03.194
Okay.

1823
01:20:05.931 --> 01:20:07.232
I don't think
she's gonna find him.

1824
01:20:07.232 --> 01:20:09.601
[group] Shut up. Ted.

1825
01:20:14.673 --> 01:20:16.274
[phone ringing]

1826
01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:23.581
Hi!

1827
01:20:26.618 --> 01:20:30.555
[***]

1828
01:20:30.555 --> 01:20:32.023
Okay.

1829
01:20:34.359 --> 01:20:35.961
Thank you.

1830
01:20:37.596 --> 01:20:41.633
[***]

1831
01:20:48.773 --> 01:20:52.777
[***]

1832
01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:58.316
[***]

1833
01:20:58.316 --> 01:20:59.384
Hi.

1834
01:21:00.719 --> 01:21:02.454
-Hi.
-So. um...

1835
01:21:02.454 --> 01:21:04.089
All my life.

1836
01:21:04.089 --> 01:21:05.590
I've...

1837
01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:07.492
I've lived up
to these expectations

1838
01:21:07.492 --> 01:21:10.829
of my friends. my family...

1839
01:21:10.829 --> 01:21:12.497
myself.

1840
01:21:12.497 --> 01:21:15.467
and you're the first person

1841
01:21:15.467 --> 01:21:16.368
in a long time

1842
01:21:16.368 --> 01:21:17.769
who has seen me
for exactly who I am.

1843
01:21:19.671 --> 01:21:22.107
And didn't expect a thing.

1844
01:21:23.141 --> 01:21:24.442
I do see you.

1845
01:21:24.442 --> 01:21:26.311
For the first time
in a long time.

1846
01:21:26.311 --> 01:21:28.079
I feel like
someone sees me. too.

1847
01:21:28.079 --> 01:21:29.848
and I realize how rare that is.

1848
01:21:31.016 --> 01:21:32.250
I...

1849
01:21:32.250 --> 01:21:33.418
hired a lawyer.

1850
01:21:34.653 --> 01:21:36.121
I can't stay married to Nate.

1851
01:21:37.455 --> 01:21:39.324
Why not?

1852
01:21:39.324 --> 01:21:40.492
Because I love you.

1853
01:21:42.661 --> 01:21:43.795
I love you. too.

1854
01:21:47.699 --> 01:21:52.037
[***]

1855
01:21:57.776 --> 01:21:59.277
-Let's make a wish.
-Okay.

1856
01:22:02.714 --> 01:22:04.649
You're still here.

1857
01:22:04.649 --> 01:22:06.184
Yeah. I figured
I'd stick around a while.

1858
01:22:11.189 --> 01:22:12.791
You're not gonna
faint again. are you?

1859
01:22:12.791 --> 01:22:13.858
No.

1860
01:22:13.858 --> 01:22:15.360
Good. 'cause I...

1861
01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:16.494
I have a surprise.

1862
01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:22.500
[***]

1863
01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:24.235
Your grandma called.
didn't she?

1864
01:22:24.235 --> 01:22:26.638
There's a distinct possibility.

1865
01:22:28.006 --> 01:22:30.709
* Love will be there
in the morning *

1866
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:36.247
* If you'll be
with me tonight *

1867
01:22:39.384 --> 01:22:44.556
