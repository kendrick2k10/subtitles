00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:06.133
so frequent
in recent years that

4
00:00:06.167 --> 00:00:09.067
the U.S. Government
can no longer dismiss them.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.700
Days ago. the Pentagon
delivered this.
their highly anticipated

7
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:16.833
declassified report
on UFO activity.

8
00:00:16.867 --> 00:00:19.367
Tonight. we will take
a deep dive

9
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.267
into the report
and examine what It revealed
about the state of

10
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.300
our national
and global security.

11
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:28.467
And perhaps life beyond
our solar system.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.400
This is UFOs
Declassified Live.

13
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.633
Welcome to
UFOs Declassified Live.

Normally I'm traveling
to far flung locations
around the world

00:00:53.467 --> 00:00:57.133
Investigating mysteries
on my series
Expedition Unknown.

17
00:00:57.167 --> 00:01:00.067
This evening they've let me
take a shower and clean up
a little bit.

00:01:00.067 --> 00:01:03.133
I'm here in Las Vegas.

Jessica Chobot.

21
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:08.267
Hi. thanks for having me.
happy to be here.

22
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.067
I am looking forward
to declassifying some UFOs.

23
00:01:12.067 --> 00:01:13.967
It's going to be a big night.

24
00:01:14.067 --> 00:01:18.300
Together we will be
tackling the mystery
of UFOs. this report.

25
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:20.567
the science
of these aerial anomalies

26
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.133
and who or what
could be behind them.

27
00:01:23.167 --> 00:01:28.133
We'll do it by deciphering
the fresh off the press
Pentagon UFO report

28
00:01:28.167 --> 00:01:30.900
and the jaw dropping footage
that prompted it.

29
00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:34.633
We have got a rotating panel
of experts to analyze
everything tonight

30
00:01:34.667 --> 00:01:38.333
and we want to hear
from you. tweet using
the hashtag.

investigative journalist.
George Knapp

35
00:01:50.867 --> 00:01:52.600
and investigative filmmaker.

36
00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:56.567
the man who kicked off
this whole thing with some
of the most compelling images

37
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.233
of UFOs caught on tape.

38
00:01:58.267 --> 00:02:01.133
Jeremy Corbell. good to see
both of you.

39
00:02:01.167 --> 00:02:02.967
-Nice to see ya. Josh.
-Yeah. thanks for being here.

40
00:02:03.067 --> 00:02:05.800
All right. this Pentagon
report was initially requested

41
00:02:05.833 --> 00:02:08.433
by the US Select Committee
on Intelligence

42
00:02:08.467 --> 00:02:13.133
in December of 2020.
but its roots go far
deeper than that.

43
00:02:13.167 --> 00:02:14.067
Take a look.

44
00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:17.333
[narrator] UFO sightings
have been tracked by

45
00:02:17.367 --> 00:02:20.133
the United States government
since the 1940s.

46
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.100
As claims have
often been dismissed
by government officials.

47
00:02:25.133 --> 00:02:28.067
the public has no idea
of the extent of the activity

48
00:02:28.067 --> 00:02:30.467
or what it could mean
to national security.

49
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.267
however. reports of what
has been described
as aggressive UFO activity

50
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.767
has spiked in recent years.

51
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.267
especially over military
institutions.

52
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.400
putting the United States
Department of Defense
on edge.

53
00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:43.967
[pilot] 50 knots.

54
00:02:44.067 --> 00:02:45.267
Closing in.

55
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.500
These increased public
sightings. along
with UFO footage

56
00:02:48.533 --> 00:02:51.433
leaked by military personnel
has forced the DOD

57
00:02:51.467 --> 00:02:53.333
to change their long standing
position.

58
00:02:53.367 --> 00:02:56.133
It is history changing.
it is without a doubt.

59
00:02:56.167 --> 00:02:57.667
the story of the millennia.

60
00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.600
[narrator] And for the first
time. they have
authenticated videos

61
00:03:00.633 --> 00:03:02.800
of unidentified
flying objects.

62
00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:06.333
they know that these crafts
feature highly advanced
technology.

63
00:03:06.367 --> 00:03:08.600
and are not part
of the US military.

64
00:03:08.633 --> 00:03:11.367
This caught the attention
of the Senate Intelligence
Committee

65
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.967
led by Senator Marco Rubio.

66
00:03:13.067 --> 00:03:17.267
they demanded a full report
on UFOs for the sake
of national security.

67
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.700
Anything that enters
an airspace.
that's not supposed

68
00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:21.167
to be there is a threat.

69
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.700
[narrator] Coming off
a flurry of intense interest
from the media.

70
00:03:23.733 --> 00:03:26.767
the report was delivered
to Congress just days ago.

71
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.933
Tonight. we identify
key findings
and unanswered questions.

72
00:03:30.967 --> 00:03:32.833
Who do these craft
belong to?

73
00:03:32.867 --> 00:03:35.100
Adversaries in Russia
or China.

74
00:03:35.133 --> 00:03:38.867
is there a possibility
they originated beyond
our solar system?

75
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.933
Or is there a peaceful
and earthly explanation?

76
00:03:41.967 --> 00:03:44.633
And what does the evidence
revealed in the report mean

77
00:03:44.667 --> 00:03:46.833
for the United States
and the world?

78
00:03:47.733 --> 00:03:50.367
All right. well. let's get
right into it.

79
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.267
George. let's start with you.
you have been investigating
UFOs from ground zero here

80
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.700
in the desert for more
than 30 years.

81
00:03:57.733 --> 00:04:00.233
First blush reaction.
what do you make
of this report?

82
00:04:00.267 --> 00:04:03.167
it's massively important.
it's such a radical departure

83
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.367
from what we've been
spoon fed. the lies
and obfuscation

84
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.900
we've been spoon fed
by our military
and our government for decades

85
00:04:09.933 --> 00:04:12.567
behind the scenes since 1947.

86
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.933
Our military is taking this
very seriously.

87
00:04:14.967 --> 00:04:16.800
while telling the public.
there's nothing to it.

88
00:04:16.833 --> 00:04:18.400
Don't worry about it. move on.

89
00:04:18.433 --> 00:04:20.600
This report
is only nine pages.

90
00:04:20.633 --> 00:04:22.333
it doesn't have
a lot of details.

91
00:04:22.367 --> 00:04:24.600
but it at least
is a new policy direction

92
00:04:24.633 --> 00:04:26.533
and it screams out
two things to me.

93
00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:29.633
One. is that UFOs are real
and they are
physical objects.

94
00:04:29.667 --> 00:04:31.167
two. they're not ours.

95
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.367
All right. Jeremy.
you have had your eyes
on most of the videos

96
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.500
that we're talking about
tonight. long before

97
00:04:36.533 --> 00:04:39.300
they ever went to Congress.
your thoughts on all of this?

98
00:04:39.333 --> 00:04:41.467
I'm highly encouraged
by this report.

99
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.800
mainly I'm encouraged by
the disappointment
from the public.

100
00:04:44.833 --> 00:04:47.267
people wanted more substance.
more information.

101
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.367
they don't have
any videos
in the public report.

102
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.533
but what that shows me
is that pop culture
is grabbing on to this

103
00:04:52.567 --> 00:04:53.600
UFO mystery.

104
00:04:53.633 --> 00:04:56.100
and they're agreeing
and the military is saying.

105
00:04:56.133 --> 00:04:58.967
"We should study
this phenomenon
scientifically."

106
00:04:59.067 --> 00:05:02.233
that's what the report says.
This requires study.

107
00:05:02.267 --> 00:05:04.267
George .I think you probably
know better than anyone

108
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.700
as an investigative journalist
how secretive the government
can be

109
00:05:07.733 --> 00:05:09.567
on the topic of UFOs.

110
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.067
Why the sudden rush
to transparency here?

111
00:05:12.067 --> 00:05:15.067
it's a combination of events
that this overnight success

112
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.167
actually started about
26 years ago here
in Las Vegas.

113
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.633
Robert Bigelow. businessman
created his own independent
UFO think tank

114
00:05:22.667 --> 00:05:24.900
that got the attention
of Senator Harry Reid.

115
00:05:24.933 --> 00:05:28.133
who a decade later
got $22 million to devote

116
00:05:28.167 --> 00:05:32.633
to a secret program
that studied UFOs
and related phenomena.

117
00:05:32.667 --> 00:05:35.333
that there was a corollary
program that existed

118
00:05:35.367 --> 00:05:37.400
in the Pentagon
that collected information

119
00:05:37.433 --> 00:05:39.700
including some of the videos
that we're going to see
tonight.

120
00:05:39.733 --> 00:05:43.233
and it came spilling out
in The New York Times
in December 2017

121
00:05:43.267 --> 00:05:45.367
and it's rolled like
a snowball ever since.

122
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.867
I want to talk about
technology a little bit
here at the top.

123
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.800
you know. in this report.
there are 143 unidentified.

124
00:05:51.833 --> 00:05:56.933
you know. instances.
a lot of those were made
with real high tech stuff.

125
00:05:56.967 --> 00:06:00.067
FLIR is one of them.
a forward looking infrared.

126
00:06:00.067 --> 00:06:03.967
how does this kind
of technology differ
from other sensor systems?

127
00:06:04.067 --> 00:06:06.267
Right. so we're living in
a different world now

128
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.233
where we have corroborative
video and thermal evidence.

129
00:06:09.267 --> 00:06:11.067
so it's not just
a pilot saying.

130
00:06:11.067 --> 00:06:14.100
"Hey. I saw a UFO.
it did some amazing
maneuvers."

131
00:06:14.133 --> 00:06:16.467
Now you have.
as you said. forward
looking infrared

132
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.367
which is a thermal camera.
you have night vision

133
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.667
which amplifies light.

134
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.667
We also have radar
and also just corroborative
sensor data

135
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.267
that is not released
to the public.

136
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.700
they all tell the same tale
about UFOs.

137
00:06:28.733 --> 00:06:31.333
Okay. can I play
devil's advocate here
for a moment?

138
00:06:31.367 --> 00:06:33.100
Uh. let me put on
my skeptic hat.

139
00:06:33.133 --> 00:06:36.267
we've got 143
unidentified objects

140
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.967
or instances here
in this report.

141
00:06:38.067 --> 00:06:40.867
a skeptic might say.
"Well. they're unidentified.

142
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.100
you know. despite all
this high tech equipment

143
00:06:43.133 --> 00:06:44.600
in the FLIR and the radar.

144
00:06:44.633 --> 00:06:46.067
We don't know what
these things are.

145
00:06:46.067 --> 00:06:47.467
they still look blurry
and fuzzy."

146
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.733
What do we say to that?

147
00:06:48.767 --> 00:06:51.167
Well. more than 80.
more than half of the cases

148
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.200
in that report are confirmed
by more than one sensor.

149
00:06:54.233 --> 00:06:57.433
so they've got a pretty strong
indication that these are

150
00:06:57.467 --> 00:07:00.733
physical objects.
they appear to be
manufactured objects.

151
00:07:00.767 --> 00:07:03.900
they have some kind
of propulsion system
that we do not understand.

152
00:07:03.933 --> 00:07:07.600
And what about the possibility
that these objects are.

153
00:07:07.633 --> 00:07:09.067
you know. from our own
planet?

154
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.800
Could these belong
to a foreign government
and adversary?

155
00:07:11.833 --> 00:07:15.067
That's also addressed in here
and they have to leave
those options open

156
00:07:15.067 --> 00:07:18.067
in the report. they say.
could be foreign made
technology.

157
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.933
although we have
no evidence of that.

158
00:07:19.967 --> 00:07:21.800
Could it be secret
American technology?

159
00:07:21.833 --> 00:07:24.067
Yeah. but there's no evidence
of that either.

160
00:07:24.067 --> 00:07:25.300
But that's a big
question. right?

161
00:07:25.333 --> 00:07:28.167
Could this be a technology
that comes from us. you know.

162
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.367
the US military.
the most advanced military
in the world.

163
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.667
do we have the technology
to create objects like this?

164
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:35.767
We do not.

165
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.633
-[chuckles]
-Not that anyone
I've ever talked to.

166
00:07:37.667 --> 00:07:40.067
I've been pretty far.
far up the food chain

167
00:07:40.067 --> 00:07:42.100
and no one says
that this is our technology.

168
00:07:42.133 --> 00:07:44.167
Okay. a lot more
on this tonight obviously.

169
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.700
one of the simplest takeaways
from the report so far

170
00:07:46.733 --> 00:07:48.433
that you're going
to be hearing a lot
about tonight

171
00:07:48.467 --> 00:07:52.800
is the term of UAP.
which stands for
unidentified aerial phenomena.

172
00:07:52.833 --> 00:07:56.900
it is the official somewhat
fancier government name
for UFOs.

173
00:07:56.933 --> 00:08:00.067
But until that catches on.
you're going to be hearing
both terms tonight.

174
00:08:00.067 --> 00:08:02.067
and right now.
we are going to hear
from our co-host

175
00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:06.400
Jessica Chobot
who has an exclusive
live interview. Jessica.

176
00:08:06.433 --> 00:08:09.833
Thanks. Josh.
We have got a lot of questions
to address tonight

177
00:08:09.867 --> 00:08:12.533
and our first guest is here
to help get some answers.

178
00:08:12.567 --> 00:08:15.633
Joining us now remotely
is counterterrorism
subcommittee chairman.

179
00:08:15.667 --> 00:08:18.867
André Carson. who led
the classified briefing
on UAPs

180
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.233
for members
of the House Intelligence
Committee.

181
00:08:21.267 --> 00:08:23.600
Good to see you.
Congressman Carson.

182
00:08:23.633 --> 00:08:25.167
What a pleasure. thank you.

183
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.633
Thanks for being
on the show.
so I'll jump right in.

184
00:08:27.667 --> 00:08:31.833
what. why do you feel
that the report was important
enough to push through?

185
00:08:34.067 --> 00:08:36.633
Well. I think for me.
you know.

186
00:08:36.667 --> 00:08:39.467
that this is a national
security priority.

187
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.333
If there is technology
out there that
we can't explain

188
00:08:43.367 --> 00:08:47.733
that has huge implications
for the safety and security
of the American people.

189
00:08:47.767 --> 00:08:49.467
you know. for many years.

190
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.067
I've been urging
our intelligence community

191
00:08:52.067 --> 00:08:54.700
to take UAPs.
commonly known as UFOs

192
00:08:54.733 --> 00:08:56.433
more seriously
for this very reason.

193
00:08:56.467 --> 00:08:58.467
so. I'm very pleased
that we're moving in

194
00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.867
the right direction
on that goal.

195
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.767
Awesome. So were
you pleased with
the results of the report?

196
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.400
I mean. you mentioned
you were moving towards
the goal.

197
00:09:04.433 --> 00:09:07.067
but are you pleased
with the report itself?

198
00:09:07.067 --> 00:09:12.967
Well. I was pleased
that the DNI issued
a public report on this issue.

199
00:09:13.067 --> 00:09:16.367
obviously. the content
of the report shows

200
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.633
that we need to do
a lot more research
and investigating.

201
00:09:19.667 --> 00:09:23.967
Even though this report
didn't give us all
of the answers.

202
00:09:24.067 --> 00:09:27.800
It's very significant
because it represents
a big shift

203
00:09:27.833 --> 00:09:31.333
in the way
our intelligence community
handles information.

204
00:09:31.367 --> 00:09:34.867
So. what part of the report
stands out the most to you?

205
00:09:37.133 --> 00:09:41.133
You know. I think the size
and scale of the reporting

206
00:09:41.167 --> 00:09:43.867
on UAPs is the most
significant.

207
00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:48.100
-Mm-hmm.
-The DNI report clearly
outlines an initial baseline

208
00:09:48.133 --> 00:09:50.400
for the sheer number
of UAP events.

209
00:09:50.433 --> 00:09:54.600
There were 144 reports
of UAP events

210
00:09:54.633 --> 00:09:56.167
from government sources

211
00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.200
and 80 of those reports
involve multiple sensors

212
00:10:00.233 --> 00:10:03.600
that detect the UAP.
so that's a fairly
sizable number.

213
00:10:03.633 --> 00:10:06.867
Um. you know.
it's not a one off.

214
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.567
So. once. you know.
it's not a. it's not

215
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.367
a once in a blue moon
phenomenon.

216
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.700
Something is going on here

217
00:10:13.733 --> 00:10:15.767
and we all know
how to explain it.

218
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:19.767
So with that being said.
then what do you personally
believe the UAPs are?

219
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.567
Well. I'll say this.

220
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:28.200
I. I think we have
a lot more investigating to do

221
00:10:28.233 --> 00:10:31.367
before I can answer
that confidently.

222
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.267
Mmm-hmm.
But I think a lot of us.

223
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:39.833
a lot of folks like me.
um. would like to say
that we...

224
00:10:39.867 --> 00:10:41.867
we suspect if
there's extraterrestrial life.

225
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.100
but. you know.
the intelligence community
says we can't completely rule

226
00:10:45.133 --> 00:10:47.600
that out. but it's clear.

227
00:10:47.633 --> 00:10:49.533
we have to do
a lot more digging.

228
00:10:49.567 --> 00:10:52.067
All of the stakeholders
have to come together

229
00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:55.433
and put aside any
preconceived notions
about UAPs

230
00:10:55.467 --> 00:10:59.000
and really engage
in a very good faith effort

231
00:10:59.033 --> 00:11:01.633
to study the potential
security threat. obviously.

232
00:11:01.667 --> 00:11:05.967
so we need teams
of experts across
the national security space

233
00:11:06.067 --> 00:11:07.833
and across the intelligence
community as well

234
00:11:07.867 --> 00:11:10.867
as civilian reports
really studying this issue.

235
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:14.100
Taking input. and I think
making very sound conclusions

236
00:11:14.133 --> 00:11:17.700
about what this could be.
whether it's a threat
to our national security

237
00:11:17.733 --> 00:11:20.900
And where I believe I can be
the most helpful

238
00:11:20.933 --> 00:11:25.133
is by encouraging
more research and informing
the public as much as we can

239
00:11:25.167 --> 00:11:26.500
about these findings.

240
00:11:26.533 --> 00:11:27.833
Well. it's been great
talking to you.

241
00:11:27.867 --> 00:11:30.100
Thank you
so much for your time. sir.

242
00:11:30.133 --> 00:11:32.767
-What an honor. Thank you.
-Thank you. Josh.

243
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.133
Thanks. Jessica.
Well. we have
a packed show tonight.

244
00:11:36.167 --> 00:11:39.267
including an interview
with former White House
Chief of Staff.

245
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:43.167
John Podesta and stunning
just released video

246
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.567
from the deck of
the aircraft carrier
USS Omaha.

247
00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.367
It is just one piece
of the incredible footage

248
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.067
that we're going
to be reviewing tonight

249
00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:55.067
as we unravel the identity
of these unidentified objects

250
00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.067
and during the break.
hit us up on Twitter

251
00:11:58.067 --> 00:12:01.533
using the hashtag
UFOs Declassified Live.

252
00:12:01.567 --> 00:12:04.333
send in your questions.
your comments. your photos.

253
00:12:04.367 --> 00:12:07.067
heck. send in your UFO footage
if you've got it.

254
00:12:07.067 --> 00:12:10.333
It's a big night and we are
just getting started.
so stay tuned.

255
00:12:36.533 --> 00:12:40.067
Welcome back
to UFOs Declassified Live.

256
00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.333
I'm Josh Gates.

257
00:12:41.367 --> 00:12:44.367
In addition to being
a former White House
Chief of Staff.

258
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.133
John Podesta has been
a longtime believer

259
00:12:47.167 --> 00:12:50.067
in the possibility
of extraterrestrial life.

260
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.367
to discuss the latest
revelations in
the Pentagon UFO report

261
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.600
is John Podesta.

262
00:12:54.633 --> 00:12:56.100
Thanks for joining us. sir.

263
00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.600
Good to be with you. Josh.

264
00:12:58.633 --> 00:13:01.667
Well. look I know that
you have been calling

265
00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.500
for the release of this
kind of information
for a long time.

266
00:13:04.533 --> 00:13:06.900
so you must be relieved
that this report has come out.

267
00:13:06.933 --> 00:13:09.200
having read it.
what's your takeaway?

268
00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.067
Well. I welcomed it.

269
00:13:12.067 --> 00:13:16.667
Uh. it answered a lot
of. it gave us a lot
of information.

270
00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.467
but it opened up
more questions
than it answered.

271
00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.633
Right. And I know
you have said
for a long time

272
00:13:22.667 --> 00:13:25.833
that that really all
of this information
should be declassified.

273
00:13:25.867 --> 00:13:28.100
there is a classified version
of this report.

274
00:13:28.133 --> 00:13:31.733
there's also video.
we know that the Pentagon
has not released.

275
00:13:31.767 --> 00:13:34.800
Do you believe still
that all of that should
come out?

276
00:13:34.833 --> 00:13:38.267
Yes. and I think
the American people
would welcome that.

277
00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:41.400
Uh. we know that
the United States government

278
00:13:41.433 --> 00:13:44.567
has had 144 encounters

279
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:49.567
with unidentified aerial
phenomenon since 2004.

280
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.467
and they can only explain
one of them.

281
00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.933
So. let the public
look at this data.

282
00:13:53.967 --> 00:13:57.600
look at the video.
let scientists chew on it

283
00:13:57.633 --> 00:13:59.833
and I think we'll learn
a lot more about

284
00:13:59.867 --> 00:14:04.433
what the. what these
UAP phenomena really
is all about.

285
00:14:04.467 --> 00:14:07.567
You famously tweeted in 2014
that you felt that one

286
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.400
of your greatest failures
was not securing the release

287
00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:13.067
of this information during
the Obama administration.

288
00:14:13.067 --> 00:14:14.667
why do you think
it's so important

289
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.133
that the public
get a look at this?

290
00:14:17.167 --> 00:14:22.067
I think the public really
is very intrigued by

291
00:14:22.067 --> 00:14:26.633
whether there is life
and whether these UAPs

292
00:14:26.667 --> 00:14:31.567
are examples of that
and there's just
tremendous popular interest.

293
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.667
Uh. and I think that the.
the government really has

294
00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:37.267
an obligation not to hide it.

295
00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:41.133
uh. not to. not to pretend
that it doesn't exist.

296
00:14:41.167 --> 00:14:46.067
not to be embarrassed by it.
but just put the information
out. let people see it.

297
00:14:46.067 --> 00:14:48.167
understand it. debate it.

298
00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:52.500
And considering we have now
in this report. 143 examples

299
00:14:52.533 --> 00:14:55.467
of what seemed
to be technologically advanced

300
00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.867
something that has been
detected.

301
00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.533
Does this represent
an intelligence failure

302
00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:03.567
on some level
that we don't know
what these objects are?

303
00:15:04.867 --> 00:15:06.667
Well. look. I think
for a long time.

304
00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:10.833
there was just a stigma
involved in even discussing
this phenomena.

305
00:15:10.867 --> 00:15:13.067
-Right.
-And so I think people
look the other way.

306
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:18.633
And I'm glad now as a result
of efforts.
really heroic efforts.

307
00:15:18.667 --> 00:15:21.933
particularly by former
Democratic Senator Harry Reid

308
00:15:21.967 --> 00:15:24.167
to push this out
into the public.

309
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.433
The Pentagon's taking it
seriously. they've created
a UAP Task Force.

310
00:15:28.467 --> 00:15:31.067
the Navy and Air Force
both have programs.

311
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:34.433
but again.
I'd like to see this more
on the civilian side.

312
00:15:34.467 --> 00:15:41.100
led by civilian scientists.
so that we don't have
this cover of classification.

313
00:15:41.133 --> 00:15:44.433
uh. hiding a lot
of information
from the American public.

314
00:15:44.467 --> 00:15:47.133
Well. I'm sure there is
much more information
to come on this front.

315
00:15:47.167 --> 00:15:50.467
Thank you so much
for your time today.
I really appreciate it. sir.

316
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.200
Thanks for having me on.

317
00:15:52.233 --> 00:15:56.933
You know this latest round
of UAP sightings generates
a lot of questions.

318
00:15:56.967 --> 00:16:00.067
none more important
than friend or foe.

319
00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:04.800
are these UAPs friendly
or could they be set on
doing us harm?

320
00:16:04.833 --> 00:16:07.833
And regardless of whether
they're an earthly adversary

321
00:16:07.867 --> 00:16:11.300
or extra-terrestrial.
how prepared is our military?

322
00:16:12.467 --> 00:16:14.200
[pilot] Oh. my gosh. dude.

323
00:16:14.233 --> 00:16:16.767
[Jim] Something is out there
and we don't know what it is.

324
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.433
people start seeing
unidentified flying objects

325
00:16:20.467 --> 00:16:22.733
and they're coming over
a military bases.

326
00:16:22.767 --> 00:16:24.633
and we don't know
what to do about it.

327
00:16:24.667 --> 00:16:29.600
I wonder if we are not
in some ways less prepared

328
00:16:29.633 --> 00:16:32.200
for this problem
than we were 70 years ago.

329
00:16:32.233 --> 00:16:36.567
the facts are that we have
unexplained aerial phenomena

330
00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.600
that are penetrating
our airspace.

331
00:16:38.633 --> 00:16:40.233
we don't know what they are.

332
00:16:40.267 --> 00:16:42.433
We don't understand
their capabilities.

333
00:16:42.467 --> 00:16:45.067
they seem to defy the laws
of physics as we know it.

334
00:16:45.067 --> 00:16:46.133
[man] Lift off.

335
00:16:46.167 --> 00:16:50.833
The United States Navy
has admitted that there are

336
00:16:50.867 --> 00:16:53.267
objects which they do not know
what they are.

337
00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.800
So whether or not
there's enough data
in all of these videos

338
00:16:56.833 --> 00:16:58.633
is not the key point.

339
00:16:58.667 --> 00:17:01.833
The key point
is the US Navy admits

340
00:17:01.867 --> 00:17:04.533
that they can't identify
the objects.

341
00:17:08.767 --> 00:17:12.800
[Jim] It is definitely
displaying technology
in order

342
00:17:12.833 --> 00:17:16.167
of technology well. well
beyond we have here.

343
00:17:18.567 --> 00:17:20.533
Uh. how do we take that?

344
00:17:20.567 --> 00:17:23.700
Uh. I don't know. I mean.
do we see that as a threat?

345
00:17:23.733 --> 00:17:25.900
Are we ready.
are the world
governments ready?

346
00:17:25.933 --> 00:17:28.567
Is the United States
ready to defend itself
against this threat.

347
00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.367
We've never seen
anything like it.

348
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.233
The amount of G forces
they contain.

349
00:17:33.267 --> 00:17:34.867
we don't know whether
they're piloted

350
00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.300
or remotely controlled
or their drones.

351
00:17:37.333 --> 00:17:39.267
-[pilot] What was... Splash.
-Splash.

352
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.067
They seem to be
especially concentrated.

353
00:17:42.067 --> 00:17:44.533
where there are
nuclear facilities

354
00:17:44.567 --> 00:17:47.533
there are nuclear tests.
or there are nuclear

355
00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:50.067
propulsion systems
in the military.

356
00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.967
It's been reported
these things accelerate
through the sound barrier.

357
00:17:56.067 --> 00:17:58.233
but without a sonic boom.

358
00:17:58.267 --> 00:18:02.467
This implies almost
a new physics

359
00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.700
in terms of defining a threat.

360
00:18:05.733 --> 00:18:09.733
The military sometimes use
the equation

361
00:18:09.767 --> 00:18:13.700
capability times intent
equals threat.

362
00:18:13.733 --> 00:18:16.167
We don't have one
of the values.

363
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:20.833
the capability looks really.
really impressive.

364
00:18:20.867 --> 00:18:24.067
The intent remains
completely unknown.

365
00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.833
Well. joining veteran
investigative reporter
George Knapp

366
00:18:30.867 --> 00:18:34.100
and documentarian
and UFO expert
Jeremy Corbell

367
00:18:34.133 --> 00:18:35.433
on the panel.

368
00:18:35.467 --> 00:18:38.133
our former member
of the British Ministry
of Defense Nick Pope

369
00:18:38.167 --> 00:18:41.067
and former CIA officer
Jim Semivan.

370
00:18:41.067 --> 00:18:42.400
Welcome to you both.
Thanks for being here.

371
00:18:42.433 --> 00:18:44.733
-You're welcome. Josh.
thanks for having us here.
-Absolutely. I'm.

372
00:18:44.767 --> 00:18:47.233
I'm intimidated and terrified
of you both.

373
00:18:47.267 --> 00:18:49.567
All right. let's. let's get
into some questions here.

374
00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:53.300
the report found
that there was clustering
around military assets.

375
00:18:53.333 --> 00:18:57.733
So. Jim. do you see this
as intentional targeting
of our ships and facilities?

376
00:18:57.767 --> 00:18:59.467
Oh. yes. absolutely.

377
00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.100
You know. we had
an incident in 2019.

378
00:19:02.133 --> 00:19:06.133
where they were close
to what 50 to 100 UAP swarming

379
00:19:06.167 --> 00:19:09.233
and nine vessel. I mean.
nine vessel warships

380
00:19:09.267 --> 00:19:11.300
uh. you know. were they
interested in what?

381
00:19:11.333 --> 00:19:15.300
Surveillance or were they.
be interested in being
threatening.

382
00:19:15.333 --> 00:19:16.600
uh. we don't know
that for sure.

383
00:19:16.633 --> 00:19:18.933
[Josh] I've also heard reports
about this kind of clustering

384
00:19:18.967 --> 00:19:21.067
happening around nuclear sites
is that true?

385
00:19:21.067 --> 00:19:23.800
Absolutely and we have them
around nuclear sites.

386
00:19:23.833 --> 00:19:27.467
nuclear missile sites.
nuclear testing facilities.

387
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.867
and we also have them
around our intercontinental
ballistic missile sites.

388
00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:34.433
And. you know. you look at
this and you say. well.
you know. what is this about?

389
00:19:34.467 --> 00:19:36.467
I mean all this has been
well documented.

390
00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:41.100
but they appear to be strongly
interested in our nuclear
technology. that's for sure.

391
00:19:41.133 --> 00:19:42.500
Sort of terrifying to hear.

392
00:19:42.533 --> 00:19:43.733
-It is terrifying. yeah.
-Uh. Nick.

393
00:19:43.767 --> 00:19:45.633
you brought up something
really interesting
in the package

394
00:19:45.667 --> 00:19:46.733
we just watched.

395
00:19:46.767 --> 00:19:48.067
I wanna make sure I get
this right. you brought up

396
00:19:48.067 --> 00:19:51.933
the equation
capability times intent
equals threat.

397
00:19:51.967 --> 00:19:54.067
So. you know. one of
the alarming details
in this report

398
00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:58.100
is that if the data
is accurate. the capabilities
of these. of these objects

399
00:19:58.133 --> 00:20:00.367
seems kind of off the charts.

400
00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.333
Can we really know
their intent?

401
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:03.700
No. we can't.

402
00:20:03.733 --> 00:20:05.367
If this was Russia
or China.

403
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.000
intelligence officers
would have a fair idea.

404
00:20:08.033 --> 00:20:11.267
but if it's something unknown.
possibly extraterrestrial.

405
00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:12.300
We have no idea.

406
00:20:12.333 --> 00:20:14.900
Therefore. we can't define
the threat

407
00:20:14.933 --> 00:20:17.033
and if you can't define
or evaluate it.

408
00:20:17.067 --> 00:20:19.533
hope for the best.
prepare for the worst.

409
00:20:19.567 --> 00:20:21.933
So. okay. well. let's say
that they do have

410
00:20:21.967 --> 00:20:25.000
these tremendous capabilities
and that we don't know
what they are.

411
00:20:25.033 --> 00:20:26.733
I mean. if that's.
if that's the case.

412
00:20:26.767 --> 00:20:29.700
shouldn't President Biden
be hiding in a bunker
somewhere. Jim?

413
00:20:29.733 --> 00:20:31.600
I mean.
I'm getting nervous here.

414
00:20:31.633 --> 00:20:33.433
Well. not necessarily. I mean.
you know.

415
00:20:33.467 --> 00:20:36.433
in 1940. '47. the Air Force
came out and they said.

416
00:20:36.467 --> 00:20:39.300
"We don't deem UAPs a threat."

417
00:20:39.333 --> 00:20:41.600
And there's no evidence
to we have right now

418
00:20:41.633 --> 00:20:43.300
that they're an existential
threat to this country

419
00:20:43.333 --> 00:20:44.800
or and to anybody else.

420
00:20:44.833 --> 00:20:48.267
So. at the moment. they seem
to pose more of a hazard

421
00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:52.367
to aviation than they do
a threat to the military
or to the country.

422
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.800
Let's talk about technology
here. Jim. do you.

423
00:20:54.833 --> 00:20:58.133
do you see these UAPs
as being more advanced

424
00:20:58.167 --> 00:21:01.067
than our top of the line
stealth arsenal?

425
00:21:01.067 --> 00:21:04.067
Oh. I think absolutely.
absolutely. you know.

426
00:21:04.067 --> 00:21:06.333
stealth technology
is all about low visibility.

427
00:21:06.367 --> 00:21:07.833
it's like not being seen.

428
00:21:07.867 --> 00:21:10.667
Well. these things are UAPs
on steroids.

429
00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:14.467
I mean. these are. I'm sorry
stealth fighters aircraft
on steroids.

430
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.600
They seem to appear
and disappear instantaneously.

431
00:21:17.633 --> 00:21:19.467
So. you have
to ask yourself. I mean.

432
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:23.533
are they using
a cloaking device. what are
they doing to get this?

433
00:21:23.567 --> 00:21:27.200
I've even read. Nick.
that some people
have theorized that

434
00:21:27.233 --> 00:21:30.600
our own stealth technology
is somehow based off

435
00:21:30.633 --> 00:21:33.467
of these UAPs.
that feels a little
farfetched to me.

436
00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.700
what do you make of that?

437
00:21:34.733 --> 00:21:38.967
Well. I don't know if we got
stealth technology from UFOs.

438
00:21:39.067 --> 00:21:42.600
but UFOs seem to be using it
and one of the really
interesting things

439
00:21:42.633 --> 00:21:46.600
in the report to Congress
is the phrase. "signature
management."

440
00:21:46.633 --> 00:21:51.267
These objects are taking
active measures to suppress

441
00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:54.567
their radar signature
making it more difficult
for us to track them.

442
00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.867
there's an intelligence
at play here.

443
00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:59.100
All of this is so fascinating.

444
00:21:59.133 --> 00:22:01.567
Uh. I was just informed
that we are trending
on Twitter

445
00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.433
which I think speaks
to the fascination

446
00:22:03.467 --> 00:22:05.467
that people have
with this topic.

447
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:08.400
I want to check in
with my co-host
Jessica Chobot.

448
00:22:08.433 --> 00:22:10.367
she is an investigator
in her own right.

449
00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:15.433
Tonight. she is digging in
with a very special guest
to get some answers. Jess.

450
00:22:15.467 --> 00:22:19.167
Thank you. Josh. with me
right now is former F-16
fighter pilot.

451
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:24.067
Tracy Latourette. to give us
her insight on a pilot's
eye view of these phenomena.

452
00:22:24.067 --> 00:22:27.500
So. Tracy. a common theme
when discussing these UAPs

453
00:22:27.533 --> 00:22:30.733
has been that they are
more advanced than
our military's finest.

454
00:22:30.767 --> 00:22:33.100
Our US stealth aircraft
is highly regarded though

455
00:22:33.133 --> 00:22:36.867
and our foreign adversaries
also have stealth
technology as well.

456
00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:40.633
So can you please give us
the rundown on these different
types of craft?

457
00:22:40.667 --> 00:22:45.900
You bet. Jess. so the term
stealth refers to
an aircraft's ability

458
00:22:45.933 --> 00:22:47.933
to avoid detection by radar.

459
00:22:47.967 --> 00:22:50.133
we typically hear stealth
and think of. well.

460
00:22:50.167 --> 00:22:55.167
most often the B-2 Spirit
or the F-117 Nighthawk.

461
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.133
this is the bomber.
this is our fighter.

462
00:22:57.167 --> 00:22:59.833
The great thing is
we've been able to take
lessons we've learned

463
00:22:59.867 --> 00:23:02.833
from the employment
of these two aircraft
and design

464
00:23:02.867 --> 00:23:06.067
the latest fifth generation
stealth technology

465
00:23:06.067 --> 00:23:07.733
which is at the end
down there.

466
00:23:07.767 --> 00:23:10.167
the F-22 Raptor
and not shown

467
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.133
our F-35 Lightning II.

468
00:23:12.167 --> 00:23:13.600
So. that's our latest
and greatest.

469
00:23:13.633 --> 00:23:14.933
but we're not alone.

470
00:23:14.967 --> 00:23:16.767
-Mm-hmm.
-We're not the only countries
that have these.

471
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.233
the Chinese have
the Chengdu J-20.

472
00:23:19.267 --> 00:23:21.567
The Russians have
the SU-57.

473
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:25.400
so it's important that
we continue to stay ahead
of the competition.

474
00:23:25.433 --> 00:23:27.133
we're always looking
for emerging threats.

475
00:23:27.167 --> 00:23:31.067
Interesting. so what puts
the stealth heads
and shoulders above the rest?

476
00:23:31.067 --> 00:23:32.967
Well. I think that's really
one of the best things

477
00:23:33.067 --> 00:23:38.067
about our nation. is not only
are we. do we have
these great aircraft

478
00:23:38.067 --> 00:23:40.067
that have proven time
and again

479
00:23:40.067 --> 00:23:41.700
that they're incredibly
effective.

480
00:23:41.733 --> 00:23:43.967
But. we never give up.
we never rest.

481
00:23:44.067 --> 00:23:45.667
we're always pushing
the envelope.

482
00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:50.500
In fact. this technologies.
or. I'm sorry. that F-22
and 35 technology

483
00:23:50.533 --> 00:23:51.867
-is 20 years old.
-Yeah.

484
00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:56.767
-So I would love to know
what is classified.
-What's going on?

485
00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.767
-what's behind the curtain.
-[laughs]

486
00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.567
-Something's happening.
-Oh. for sure.

487
00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:04.067
Well. can any of these
aircraft actually move
like the UAPs

488
00:24:04.067 --> 00:24:06.067
we've been capturing
and seeing?

489
00:24:06.067 --> 00:24:08.700
I haven't seen any of them
move exactly like that.

490
00:24:08.733 --> 00:24:11.133
but we do have some
that have some thrust
vectoring

491
00:24:11.167 --> 00:24:13.900
that does allow them
to do some interesting
maneuvers.

492
00:24:13.933 --> 00:24:16.867
but it's still very different
than. than what
we're seeing tonight.

493
00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:20.333
Interesting. all right. well.
thank you for your insight.
Tracy. Josh. back to you.

494
00:24:20.367 --> 00:24:22.067
Thank you. Jessica and Tracy.

495
00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:25.867
Next up. we have got one
of the most incredible videos

496
00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:29.233
responsible for
the compilation
of the Pentagon report.

497
00:24:29.267 --> 00:24:31.233
it is called
the Tic Tac video.

498
00:24:31.267 --> 00:24:33.833
and you will not believe
how this thing moves.

499
00:24:33.867 --> 00:24:37.933
Plus. we've got
that amazing. newly released
footage from the deck

500
00:24:37.967 --> 00:24:39.267
of the USS Omaha.

501
00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.067
when our broadcast continues

502
00:24:41.067 --> 00:24:46.200
and tweet us using
the hashtag UFOs Declassified
Live on Twitter

503
00:24:46.233 --> 00:24:48.600
and share your close
encounter stories.

504
00:24:48.633 --> 00:24:49.867
We'll be right back.

505
00:25:11.167 --> 00:25:14.333
[Josh] Welcome back to UFOs
Declassified Live.

506
00:25:14.367 --> 00:25:19.067
well. based on our poll.
it looks like 66.7% of you

507
00:25:19.067 --> 00:25:21.900
do not believe there is
any evidence of hostility

508
00:25:21.933 --> 00:25:24.833
with recent UFO sightings.

509
00:25:24.867 --> 00:25:28.967
Peace loving aliens.
The other 33% of you.
Mars Attacks.

510
00:25:29.067 --> 00:25:32.633
Welcome back to the show.
uh. I am really excited
that you're all here.

511
00:25:32.667 --> 00:25:38.533
we're having an amazing time
going through the recently
submitted to the public.

512
00:25:38.567 --> 00:25:40.500
Pentagon UFO report.

513
00:25:40.533 --> 00:25:44.300
Uh. joining us now.
we have a very special guest
here joining our panel.

514
00:25:44.333 --> 00:25:47.767
we have got our resident
F-16 fighter pilot
Tracy Latourrette.

515
00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.233
welcome. thank you
for joining us.

516
00:25:49.267 --> 00:25:50.667
-Thanks for having me.
-Of course.

517
00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:54.300
So. as we just saw.
the report that was
just delivered to Congress

518
00:25:54.333 --> 00:25:57.467
leans heavily on the accounts
of military aviators.

519
00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:58.767
Of course. that makes sense.

520
00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:02.100
They are equipped
with the best surveillance
technology around

521
00:26:02.133 --> 00:26:05.133
and footage captured
using this high end gear

522
00:26:05.167 --> 00:26:06.933
is difficult to dispute.

523
00:26:06.967 --> 00:26:09.900
Get ready for this.
the following was captured
using FLIR.

524
00:26:09.933 --> 00:26:12.867
forward looking infrared
in 2004

525
00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:16.100
on the USS Nimitz
in San Diego. check it out.

526
00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:20.600
All right. Jeremy. walk us
through what we are
looking at here.

527
00:26:20.633 --> 00:26:23.733
[Jeremy] Right. so.
this is FLIR footage
which is a thermal footage

528
00:26:23.767 --> 00:26:25.367
who was Commander
Chad Underwood

529
00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.067
who was tasked out towards
the tic tac object.

530
00:26:28.067 --> 00:26:30.600
remember there were
a lot of Tic Tacs dropping in

531
00:26:30.633 --> 00:26:32.300
from 80.000 feet down
to sea level

532
00:26:32.333 --> 00:26:34.500
in less than a second
and a half.

533
00:26:34.533 --> 00:26:37.167
incredible speeds.
but they caught one of them.

534
00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.800
and this is footage
of that. and you'll see
at towards the end

535
00:26:39.833 --> 00:26:42.700
of the footage. it does
shoot off to the left end

536
00:26:42.733 --> 00:26:45.867
that the tracking pot.
it's outside of the tolerance
of it.

537
00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.633
so it can't hold it
at the end.

538
00:26:47.667 --> 00:26:50.900
Incredible speeds
are demonstrated
at the end of this video.

539
00:26:50.933 --> 00:26:52.867
[Josh] Absolutely.
remarkable stuff.

540
00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:55.867
so I have to take this over
to Tracy at this point.

541
00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:59.100
you're the only one here
at this table who really knows
what it's like to fly around

542
00:26:59.133 --> 00:27:02.300
in a fighter jet. let's say
you see one of these things.

543
00:27:02.333 --> 00:27:05.067
what do you do?
what's your.
what's your response?

544
00:27:05.067 --> 00:27:06.800
Well. what you do.
it depends. right?

545
00:27:06.833 --> 00:27:07.933
That's always the answer.

546
00:27:07.967 --> 00:27:10.833
But the first thing is always
going to be inserting

547
00:27:10.867 --> 00:27:14.667
just a split second pause
that allows me
that critical moment.

548
00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.733
to become aware
of the critical details

549
00:27:17.767 --> 00:27:19.733
in the surroundings.
assess the situation

550
00:27:19.767 --> 00:27:21.833
and then act in accordance
with my objective.

551
00:27:21.867 --> 00:27:25.067
So. in this case. that means
that I want to identify

552
00:27:25.067 --> 00:27:28.333
whether or not this
is a friendly target

553
00:27:28.367 --> 00:27:31.067
or a friendly
or if it's something else.

554
00:27:31.067 --> 00:27:33.800
and whether or not
I'm able to identify that.

555
00:27:33.833 --> 00:27:34.933
the next thing is going to be.

556
00:27:34.967 --> 00:27:37.067
"Do I see any kind
of hostile intent?"

557
00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:40.567
-And luckily. I don't see
any here so...
-All right. well. that's good.

558
00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:43.800
As a pilot.
Have you ever seen
anything like this?

559
00:27:43.833 --> 00:27:46.567
I have never seen
anything like this.
so it's pretty exciting.

560
00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.333
Okay. Wow.
All right. George.

561
00:27:48.367 --> 00:27:49.833
I want to turn to you
for a moment here.

562
00:27:49.867 --> 00:27:54.233
I've heard people refer
to a kind of checklist
of authenticity

563
00:27:54.267 --> 00:27:57.500
when it comes to UFOs.
the four main criteria being

564
00:27:57.533 --> 00:28:01.600
footage. eye witnesses.
radar. and propulsion.

565
00:28:01.633 --> 00:28:04.233
For you. how many boxes
does this footage check?

566
00:28:04.267 --> 00:28:06.133
All of them. I mean.
we've seen the footage.

567
00:28:06.167 --> 00:28:07.733
The whole world has seen
that footage is.

568
00:28:07.767 --> 00:28:09.067
and is impressed by it.

569
00:28:09.067 --> 00:28:11.600
The witnesses are
the most trustworthy people.

570
00:28:11.633 --> 00:28:15.833
they're naval aviators.
best fighter pilots
in the world.

571
00:28:15.867 --> 00:28:18.700
all credible people
with top security clearances.

572
00:28:18.733 --> 00:28:20.767
the propulsion system
is the question mark.

573
00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.567
All we know that it is
that it's not ours.

574
00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.133
Jim. any chance that
what we're seeing
in this video

575
00:28:26.167 --> 00:28:28.633
is a top secret
US military project?

576
00:28:28.667 --> 00:28:30.167
Yeah. it's highly unlikely.

577
00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:33.400
it would be absolute folly
for one branch of the military

578
00:28:33.433 --> 00:28:39.267
to introduce
a new technology into
a active military exercise.

579
00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.267
in this particular case.
a navy exercise.

580
00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:45.900
it'd be too much chance
for error and mistakes
to be made

581
00:28:45.933 --> 00:28:49.233
and the Navy hierarchy
in this case would never
have permitted it.

582
00:28:49.267 --> 00:28:52.433
Tracy. just to give me
some sense of this.

583
00:28:52.467 --> 00:28:55.767
how advanced would
this object have to be

584
00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.400
to be up there competing
with our own.

585
00:28:58.433 --> 00:29:00.900
you know. stealth aircraft
and jet fighters.

586
00:29:00.933 --> 00:29:02.167
I mean. compare the two
for me.

587
00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:05.567
Well. I think. to be able
to move as abruptly

588
00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.533
and as fast as
this object does.

589
00:29:08.567 --> 00:29:10.500
it has to be significantly
more advanced

590
00:29:10.533 --> 00:29:12.233
than our fifth generation
technology.

591
00:29:12.267 --> 00:29:13.467
but as I mentioned before.

592
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.500
that's been around
for 20 years.

593
00:29:15.533 --> 00:29:18.333
so I'd have a hard time
believing that there's not

594
00:29:18.367 --> 00:29:22.533
a whole lot of advancement
going on at those highest
classified levels

595
00:29:22.567 --> 00:29:25.600
and. remember.
none of us are allowed
to know everything.

596
00:29:25.633 --> 00:29:26.900
So...

597
00:29:26.933 --> 00:29:28.867
But. does that mean
that you think this
could be something

598
00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:30.967
that's US military or no?

599
00:29:31.067 --> 00:29:33.467
I think that the level
of classification

600
00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:35.467
that we have protects us.

601
00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.433
And. so I think
that it's possible.

602
00:29:38.467 --> 00:29:41.600
It is possible. George.
one of the things that really
jumps out at me

603
00:29:41.633 --> 00:29:45.133
about the Tic Tac video
is that it comes from 2004.

604
00:29:45.167 --> 00:29:48.100
Why do you think it took
17 years to catch

605
00:29:48.133 --> 00:29:49.733
the public's attention
like this?

606
00:29:49.767 --> 00:29:51.567
Well. it actually came out.
it was leaked.

607
00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:55.300
somebody shot it off
a screen and it got
put up on an obscure website

608
00:29:55.333 --> 00:29:58.500
then quickly taken down
and in a couple
of years later.

609
00:29:58.533 --> 00:30:01.200
there was a behind
the scenes study that was done

610
00:30:01.233 --> 00:30:03.900
that interviewed
all the pilots. collected
all that information.

611
00:30:03.933 --> 00:30:07.800
It wasn't until Jeremy
and I started talking about it
in early 2017

612
00:30:07.833 --> 00:30:09.533
that the public was starting
to catch on.

613
00:30:09.567 --> 00:30:12.267
And then The New York Times
got the video and it exploded.

614
00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:16.000
they put it on the front page.
I think that is why that story
went all over the world.

615
00:30:16.033 --> 00:30:18.133
Amazing stuff. All right.
Coming up.

616
00:30:18.167 --> 00:30:20.833
an exclusive interview
with the airmen who captured

617
00:30:20.867 --> 00:30:23.600
the footage of the Tic Tac
and later.

618
00:30:23.633 --> 00:30:27.267
we will be sharing
riveting footage
of a recent UAP sighting

619
00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:28.500
you do not want to miss.

620
00:30:28.533 --> 00:30:31.100
And we'll be speaking
to the man who released it.

621
00:30:31.133 --> 00:30:33.300
the guy sitting next to me.
Jeremy Corbell.

622
00:30:33.333 --> 00:30:36.133
as our experts continue
to examine the evidence

623
00:30:36.167 --> 00:30:38.033
and arrive at their verdict.

624
00:30:38.067 --> 00:30:40.900
Adversary. alien
or something else?

625
00:30:40.933 --> 00:30:43.000
And let us know
what you think.

626
00:30:43.033 --> 00:30:45.800
We're trending on Twitter.
so please continue
to hit us up

627
00:30:45.833 --> 00:30:49.667
using the hashtag
UFOs Declassified Live.

628
00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:52.767
send us your UAP pics
and footage.

629
00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.100
Be right back.

630
00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:21.333
[Josh] Welcome back
to the show. our live poll
shows that folks

631
00:31:21.367 --> 00:31:25.400
are pretty divided on
what the tic tac video
actually shows.

632
00:31:25.433 --> 00:31:27.600
We've got a real split opinion
on this front.

633
00:31:27.633 --> 00:31:31.067
Welcome back
to UFOs Declassified Live.

634
00:31:31.067 --> 00:31:34.700
I'm Josh Gates and joining me
on my esteemed panel
of experts.

635
00:31:34.733 --> 00:31:39.467
Our UFO aficionados
Jeremy Corbell. George Knapp.
and Jim Samivan.

636
00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:42.400
Okay. so before the break.
we saw this Tic Tac video.

637
00:31:42.433 --> 00:31:45.767
It is a remarkable
and compelling piece
of evidence

638
00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:49.300
suggesting to some
that there could be
extra-terrestrial life.

639
00:31:49.333 --> 00:31:54.900
The footage was captured back
in 2004 by former Navy airman
commander Chad Underwood

640
00:31:54.933 --> 00:31:57.800
who actually coined the term
Tic Tac UFO.

641
00:31:57.833 --> 00:32:02.600
He has never
spoken publicly about
this incident. until now.

642
00:32:02.633 --> 00:32:05.500
Now. Jeremy. I understand
that when Chad spotted this.

643
00:32:05.533 --> 00:32:09.467
whatever this was.
the systems on his aircraft
actually jammed?

644
00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.667
Yeah. his optics and weapon
systems were actively jammed.

645
00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:15.067
Okay. This is amazing stuff.
let's take a look.

646
00:32:17.067 --> 00:32:20.500
Declassified videos
and authentic
Department of Defense footage.

647
00:32:20.533 --> 00:32:22.967
[man] Splash.

648
00:32:23.067 --> 00:32:25.267
[man on radio]
There's a whole fleet...

649
00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:27.467
[Josh] You should have been
able to target it.

650
00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:32.533
you weren't. that is
a indication of active
jamming. is that correct?

651
00:32:32.567 --> 00:32:34.733
-Yes.
-Wow.

652
00:32:34.767 --> 00:32:38.500
Once I got the target
of interest on my radar.

653
00:32:38.533 --> 00:32:43.133
I took a lock.
and that's when all the kind
of the funky things

654
00:32:43.167 --> 00:32:43.900
started happening.

655
00:32:45.267 --> 00:32:49.067
The erratic nature
of the Tic Tac.

656
00:32:49.067 --> 00:32:52.567
the airspeed
was very telling to me.

657
00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.900
Then we started seeing
what we call jam strobe lines.

658
00:32:55.933 --> 00:32:58.200
strobe lines
are vertical lines

659
00:32:58.233 --> 00:33:01.500
that show up on your radar
that are indications
that you're being jammed.

660
00:33:07.067 --> 00:33:09.133
[indistinct radio chatter]

661
00:33:09.167 --> 00:33:12.500
Interview. uh.
I got to ask first. first off.

662
00:33:12.533 --> 00:33:14.767
how did you get Chad
to speak out about this?

663
00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.500
He's been really
reluctant to do that.

664
00:33:16.533 --> 00:33:19.567
Right. so. Commander
David Fravor is the man

665
00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.933
that chased the UFO
to United States military.

666
00:33:21.967 --> 00:33:24.600
this same UFO is when
that Commander Underwood

667
00:33:24.633 --> 00:33:26.100
was able to film
and he hasn't talked.

668
00:33:26.133 --> 00:33:28.500
-I like to believe I have
a charming personality.
-[laughs]

669
00:33:28.533 --> 00:33:30.133
American can decide
for themselves.

670
00:33:30.167 --> 00:33:33.500
but. also just. you know.
we became friends.
we became friends over time

671
00:33:33.533 --> 00:33:35.800
talking about this.
I'm just curious.
I wanted to know.

672
00:33:35.833 --> 00:33:38.367
Look. his aircraft
was actively jammed.

673
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:42.433
What that means
is the UFO was sending
a signal to actively jam.

674
00:33:42.467 --> 00:33:44.600
which are tied into
his weapons systems.

675
00:33:44.633 --> 00:33:48.700
that is an act of war
under normal circumstances.

676
00:33:48.733 --> 00:33:50.700
even though this is
highly abnormal.

677
00:33:50.733 --> 00:33:53.567
George. this is
your first time seeing
this video. what do you think?

678
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.833
Game changer?

679
00:33:54.867 --> 00:33:57.900
Chad Underwood oozes
credibility. like David Favre.

680
00:33:57.933 --> 00:34:00.067
likes Alex Dietrich.
like Ryan Graves.

681
00:34:00.067 --> 00:34:03.767
these naval aviators
are the best pilots
in the world. we trust them.

682
00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.467
we trust them to fly
these multimillion dollar
planes.

683
00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:07.867
we trust their judgment.

684
00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:10.200
We give them top secret
security clearances.

685
00:34:10.233 --> 00:34:12.633
so when they tell us
that something
is amiss up there.

686
00:34:12.667 --> 00:34:15.633
that this is a genuine UFO
and I've never seen
anything like it.

687
00:34:15.667 --> 00:34:16.567
I believe them.

688
00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.067
Jim. as our clandestine
expert here.

689
00:34:19.067 --> 00:34:21.200
Are you surprised
that Chad came forward?

690
00:34:21.233 --> 00:34:25.667
Yes. actually. I am.
given the taboo associated
with reporting UAPs.

691
00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:28.167
he's very brave to do this.
very courageous to do this.

692
00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:29.700
[Josh] Right. because
a lot of pilots.

693
00:34:29.733 --> 00:34:30.867
they see something like this.

694
00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:32.133
The last thing
they're going to do is

695
00:34:32.167 --> 00:34:33.400
-Talk about it. right?
-Exactly.

696
00:34:33.433 --> 00:34:36.233
That could be damaging for
their career.

697
00:34:36.267 --> 00:34:37.567
It could be a career killer.

698
00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.233
Even in this UAP report
that was

699
00:34:40.267 --> 00:34:41.533
released last week. it notes

700
00:34:41.567 --> 00:34:43.800
there's still a stigma
attached to this.

701
00:34:43.833 --> 00:34:45.700
Even though the navy
two years ago

702
00:34:45.733 --> 00:34:47.933
changed its policies.
and tried to encourage

703
00:34:47.967 --> 00:34:49.233
pilots to go ahead.

704
00:34:49.267 --> 00:34:50.800
if you see something.
say something.

705
00:34:50.833 --> 00:34:51.833
a lot of them won't do it.

706
00:34:51.867 --> 00:34:53.367
All right.
Lots to think about here.

707
00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.533
Let's go to Jessica and Tracy

708
00:34:55.567 --> 00:34:57.867
for a closer look
at the tic tac video.

709
00:34:58.533 --> 00:34:59.500
Thanks Josh.

710
00:34:59.533 --> 00:35:01.500
Tracy. as a former
fighter pilot.

711
00:35:01.533 --> 00:35:04.767
what makes the tic tack video
so compelling?

712
00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:09.867
I think the tic tac video is
interesting because it's not

713
00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:13.133
like anything most pilots
have seen before.

714
00:35:13.167 --> 00:35:18.467
And when you look at it.
it's in one spot

715
00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.333
and then kind of pulls away.

716
00:35:20.367 --> 00:35:23.333
But you can see that
he's working really hard

717
00:35:23.367 --> 00:35:24.633
to maintain the lock.

718
00:35:24.667 --> 00:35:29.400
And that suggests that just as
we heard there may have been

719
00:35:29.433 --> 00:35:31.267
some active radar jamming.

720
00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.533
And that is definitely
something that's
going to get my attention.

721
00:35:33.567 --> 00:35:34.433
Yeah. for sure.

722
00:35:34.467 --> 00:35:36.067
Well. at the end
of the tic tac video.

723
00:35:36.067 --> 00:35:39.067
like you said the craft
zooms off here

724
00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:40.433
kind of to the left.

725
00:35:40.467 --> 00:35:43.733
is it possible that the pilot
banked to the right

726
00:35:43.767 --> 00:35:47.667
inadvertently and created
his own illusion?

727
00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:48.800
That's a great question.

728
00:35:48.833 --> 00:35:50.800
Actually. if you look
in the center

729
00:35:50.833 --> 00:35:52.400
of the blue line there.

730
00:35:52.433 --> 00:35:54.367
you can see what looks like
the little aircraft.

731
00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.167
higher above it.

732
00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:57.367
-Uh-huh.
-Up there. yeah.

733
00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.400
We call that
the flight path marker.

734
00:35:59.433 --> 00:36:01.967
it's straight in line with

735
00:36:02.067 --> 00:36:03.333
what we call
the horizon line

736
00:36:03.367 --> 00:36:05.733
on either side.
and that's not in a bank.

737
00:36:05.767 --> 00:36:08.100
So. what we're seeing
is that the aircraft

738
00:36:08.133 --> 00:36:10.567
is fairly straight and level.

739
00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:14.333
and that suggests to me
that that object is actually

740
00:36:14.367 --> 00:36:18.067
doing exactly what we think.
it's zooming off on its own.

741
00:36:18.067 --> 00:36:19.533
That was a great explanation.

742
00:36:19.567 --> 00:36:21.200
Obviously I don't know
how to read radar.

743
00:36:21.233 --> 00:36:24.067
So. is there anything else on
this screen that we should be

744
00:36:24.067 --> 00:36:25.600
paying attention to?
What does it mean?

745
00:36:25.633 --> 00:36:27.867
I think an interesting
thing here. you know.
we're looking at

746
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:29.967
infrared technology.

747
00:36:30.067 --> 00:36:33.200
And down in the lower left.
you can see it says WHT.

748
00:36:33.233 --> 00:36:35.633
It's blurry and hard to see.
but that means

749
00:36:35.667 --> 00:36:39.167
we're operating at this moment
what's called a white hot.

750
00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.900
If the object is white.
that means it's hot.

751
00:36:41.933 --> 00:36:44.900
That's what we expect to see
from an aircraft because

752
00:36:44.933 --> 00:36:48.100
the engine shows hot.
so it would show white.

753
00:36:48.133 --> 00:36:50.067
Very interesting.
Thanks again. Tracy.

754
00:36:50.067 --> 00:36:51.667
Josh. back to you.

755
00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:53.067
Thanks. Jessica and Tracy.

756
00:36:53.067 --> 00:36:56.333
Coming up. we have got more
incredible information

757
00:36:56.367 --> 00:36:57.967
to share from
the pentagon report

758
00:36:58.067 --> 00:37:01.600
and breathtaking video
that checks all the big boxes.

759
00:37:01.633 --> 00:37:02.900
it is not to be missed.

760
00:37:02.933 --> 00:37:04.567
And stick around
as our experts

761
00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:06.767
are drawing ever closer
to their conclusion.

762
00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.433
Adversaries. aliens
or neither?

763
00:37:09.467 --> 00:37:10.967
And don't forget
to share your thoughts.

764
00:37:11.067 --> 00:37:12.600
your photos
and footage with us

765
00:37:12.633 --> 00:37:16.867
on twitter
using #ufosdeclassifiedlive.

766
00:37:37.933 --> 00:37:41.567
Welcome back to
UFOs Declassified Live.

767
00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:44.367
Just five days ago.
the intelligence community

768
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.400
and the public
at large received

769
00:37:46.433 --> 00:37:50.867
a long-awaited government
confirmation of UFO activity.

770
00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:53.467
I'm joined by our panel
live in Las Vegas

771
00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:56.400
to discuss the headline making
pentagon report.

772
00:37:56.433 --> 00:37:58.667
Okay. Let's go back
in time. Jeremy.

773
00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:03.200
to Roswell. the grandaddy
of all American UFO stories

774
00:38:03.233 --> 00:38:04.800
in 1947.

775
00:38:04.833 --> 00:38:08.100
We've got a 57-year gap
between that

776
00:38:08.133 --> 00:38:10.300
and the accounts that we see
in this pentagon report.

777
00:38:10.333 --> 00:38:12.233
So. why this gap?

778
00:38:12.267 --> 00:38:15.333
I assume there must've been
UFO sightings in that
intervening time.

779
00:38:15.367 --> 00:38:17.333
Yeah. that's interesting.
So. the report is going

780
00:38:17.367 --> 00:38:20.067
just from the tic tac UFO case
and then forward

781
00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:21.933
because a lot of the censored
data that they have

782
00:38:21.967 --> 00:38:23.700
and they wanna work
with the military data

783
00:38:23.733 --> 00:38:24.800
is in those years.

784
00:38:24.833 --> 00:38:27.733
But UFOs have been consistent
all the way through.

785
00:38:27.767 --> 00:38:29.667
Why do you think Roswell

786
00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:31.867
continues to capture
our imagination?

787
00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:33.200
Because it did
in the first place.

788
00:38:33.233 --> 00:38:35.167
Because the United States
military admitted

789
00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:37.267
they had a crashed
flying saucer.

790
00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:38.867
They turned it around
the next day.

791
00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:41.367
but there was a moment
they admitted it.

792
00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:43.633
[Josh] George. can we talk
about Area 51?

793
00:38:43.667 --> 00:38:45.433
You were such
a key player

794
00:38:45.467 --> 00:38:46.933
in breaking that story
wide open.

795
00:38:46.967 --> 00:38:50.267
What is the connection between
Area 51 and Roswell?

796
00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:52.767
The story of Roswell has been
muddied over the years

797
00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:53.933
and I think on purpose.

798
00:38:53.967 --> 00:38:56.200
The first story came from
the U.S. military.

799
00:38:56.233 --> 00:38:58.133
They said a flying saucer
crashed out there.

800
00:38:58.167 --> 00:39:00.800
Then they changed it to.
it was a weather balloon.

801
00:39:00.833 --> 00:39:03.367
Then they changed it again to
a super-duper double

802
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.067
secret probation
weather balloon.

803
00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:08.633
It was hard to get a good
handle of what was out there.

804
00:39:08.667 --> 00:39:11.067
But if you had a crashed
flying saucer.

805
00:39:11.067 --> 00:39:12.467
if you're trying to
take it apart.

806
00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:14.833
reverse engineer it.
figure out how it works.

807
00:39:14.867 --> 00:39:15.800
where would you take it?

808
00:39:15.833 --> 00:39:16.800
I would say the top
of the list

809
00:39:16.833 --> 00:39:19.067
would be area 51 because
it has been

810
00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:20.633
the location of choice

811
00:39:20.667 --> 00:39:23.100
for testing all kinds of
top secret platforms.

812
00:39:23.133 --> 00:39:26.267
The U-2. the Black Bird.
the stealth fighter

813
00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:27.700
were all developed out there.

814
00:39:27.733 --> 00:39:30.633
I've interviewed two dozen
witnesses or more

815
00:39:30.667 --> 00:39:32.200
who over the years
worked out there

816
00:39:32.233 --> 00:39:34.233
and said they've seen
something that sure

817
00:39:34.267 --> 00:39:36.900
looks like a flying saucer
that we were taking apart.

818
00:39:36.933 --> 00:39:39.067
to figure out how it worked.
not building it.

819
00:39:39.067 --> 00:39:40.067
Incredible stuff.

820
00:39:40.067 --> 00:39:41.667
I want to pore over
some of the language

821
00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:43.067
in this report with you. Jim.

822
00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:44.833
It says. and I'm quoting.

823
00:39:44.867 --> 00:39:47.067
"Some UAP. maybe.
technologies

824
00:39:47.067 --> 00:39:49.367
deployed by China. Russia.

825
00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:50.500
another nation. a

826
00:39:50.533 --> 00:39:51.867
non-governmental
entity perhaps.

827
00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:54.633
So. what does
a non-governmental

828
00:39:54.667 --> 00:39:55.967
entity constitute?

829
00:39:56.067 --> 00:39:58.467
I was not really sure
what they meant by that.

830
00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.333
There's a possibility
they meant either

831
00:40:00.367 --> 00:40:02.367
a terrorist organization
or perhaps

832
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.833
a rogue private
corporation.

833
00:40:04.867 --> 00:40:07.000
But in my opinion.
I think it's

834
00:40:07.033 --> 00:40:10.100
highly unlikely that
China. Russia.

835
00:40:10.133 --> 00:40:12.867
or a non-governmental
entity is behind UAPs.

836
00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:16.767
Could this be just the case
of an individual. Nick?

837
00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.867
I guess I turn to you.

838
00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:20.167
How do we know
these UAPs aren't.

839
00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.733
you know.
some kid with a drone?

840
00:40:21.767 --> 00:40:23.567
Because I'm sure that's what
a lot of skeptics

841
00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:24.967
would put forward. right?

842
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.367
All the drones we have
out there and we've seen
problems with drones

843
00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:28.733
at airports
and other places.

844
00:40:28.767 --> 00:40:30.800
Could that be what people
are seeing?

845
00:40:30.833 --> 00:40:34.300
Well. I think drones might
explain some sightings.
but not all.

846
00:40:34.333 --> 00:40:37.633
the report says
there are multiple
explanations for UFOs.

847
00:40:37.667 --> 00:40:39.733
We know what drones look like.

848
00:40:39.767 --> 00:40:41.700
We know what kind of
heat signatures

849
00:40:41.733 --> 00:40:44.667
some of them give off.
what radar returns.

850
00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:47.533
And this is not drone.

851
00:40:47.567 --> 00:40:49.700
There's something else
at play here.

852
00:40:49.733 --> 00:40:51.533
Right. Drones are not giving
fighter jets

853
00:40:51.567 --> 00:40:53.000
a run for their money
typically.

854
00:40:53.033 --> 00:40:56.333
Absolutely. Again.
it's the capability here.

855
00:40:56.367 --> 00:41:00.300
It's running rings around our
best cutting edge technology.

856
00:41:00.333 --> 00:41:03.267
So. if whatever these are
are extraterrestrial.

857
00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:05.500
if there are aliens out there
and they are.

858
00:41:05.533 --> 00:41:08.600
as they would have
to be here a technologically
advanced species.

859
00:41:08.633 --> 00:41:11.233
then chances are they come
from what is known as

860
00:41:11.267 --> 00:41:13.467
a Goldilocks planet
where conditions

861
00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:15.300
for life are just right.

862
00:41:15.333 --> 00:41:16.700
With more. here's Jessica

863
00:41:16.733 --> 00:41:20.267
and renowned astrophysicist
and author of Quantum Life.

864
00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:22.133
Dr. Hakeem Oluseyi.

865
00:41:23.367 --> 00:41:24.233
Thank you. Josh.

866
00:41:24.267 --> 00:41:26.533
Dr. O. we know
our universe is vast

867
00:41:26.567 --> 00:41:29.200
and there are more planets
beyond our solar system.

868
00:41:29.233 --> 00:41:32.933
so let's talk about life
on those planets.

869
00:41:32.967 --> 00:41:35.867
To say our universe is vast
is an understatement.

870
00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:39.200
This representation right here
shows galaxies.

871
00:41:39.233 --> 00:41:40.700
We think of galaxies as being

872
00:41:40.733 --> 00:41:42.733
the basic building blocks
of the universe

873
00:41:42.767 --> 00:41:44.867
and there's 2 trillion
galaxies

874
00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:46.300
in the observable universe.

875
00:41:46.333 --> 00:41:51.067
Now. each galaxies has
on average 100 billion stars.

876
00:41:51.067 --> 00:41:55.067
so that's 100 billion
trillion stars

877
00:41:55.067 --> 00:41:56.067
that we're talking about.

878
00:41:56.067 --> 00:41:57.867
And what we learned from
the Kepler satellite.

879
00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:00.533
is that star. when they form.

880
00:42:00.567 --> 00:42:03.300
planet formation is
a side effect of
star formation.

881
00:42:03.333 --> 00:42:05.933
So. just about every star
has planets.

882
00:42:05.967 --> 00:42:09.067
So. we're talking about
multiples of a hundred billion

883
00:42:09.067 --> 00:42:10.667
trillion when we're talking
about planets.

884
00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:13.300
So that's a lot of opportunity
for life in the universe

885
00:42:13.333 --> 00:42:15.633
and for technological life
to come about in the universe.

886
00:42:15.667 --> 00:42:17.367
That's amazing.
Tons of opportunities there.

887
00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:20.067
So. I know there are different
types of goldilocks planets.

888
00:42:20.067 --> 00:42:21.767
So. let's talk about
the ice covered ones.

889
00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:23.167
What makes it so special?

890
00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:26.067
So. when we look for life
away from earth.

891
00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:28.067
we have a phrase.
and that phrase is.

892
00:42:28.067 --> 00:42:29.267
"Follow the water."

893
00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:31.367
What we see for
ice covered worlds.

894
00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:32.533
like we have right here

895
00:42:32.567 --> 00:42:34.667
we have these in our own
solar system.

896
00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:37.233
Enceladus and Europa.
are moons.

897
00:42:37.267 --> 00:42:40.067
that have ice
on the surface.

898
00:42:40.067 --> 00:42:41.300
and the ice is miles thick.

899
00:42:41.333 --> 00:42:43.667
But under underneath
there's a liquid water ocean.

900
00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:45.167
And what we know about life.

901
00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:48.200
based on the work
of biologists
and astrobiologists

902
00:42:48.233 --> 00:42:49.600
-of the last 20 years...
-Mmm-hmm

903
00:42:49.633 --> 00:42:54.167
...is that life starts in the
absence of light and oxygen.

904
00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:57.233
So. life could get started
on a place just like this.

905
00:42:57.267 --> 00:43:00.600
Okay. and so. then what about
earth-like exoplanets?

906
00:43:00.633 --> 00:43:02.767
Yeah.
Now we're getting to planets

907
00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.467
-that are more like
ourselves. right?
-Yeah.

908
00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:06.433
So we're talking
about rocky worlds.

909
00:43:06.467 --> 00:43:08.800
And these rocky worlds
have a surface.

910
00:43:08.833 --> 00:43:12.067
And on earth's surface.
that's where we have
a lot of water.

911
00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:14.600
Now it turns out that
one of the
most common type

912
00:43:14.633 --> 00:43:17.300
of earth-like planets is
what we call a super earth.

913
00:43:17.333 --> 00:43:20.933
They're more massive.
bigger and gravity
is stronger.

914
00:43:20.967 --> 00:43:23.267
so. there is a life form that

915
00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:24.633
comes into existence there.

916
00:43:24.667 --> 00:43:28.333
it's going to be
a lot stronger
and a lot shorter.

917
00:43:28.367 --> 00:43:30.433
So. think
dwarf Incredible Hulks.

918
00:43:30.467 --> 00:43:32.067
That's amazing.

919
00:43:32.067 --> 00:43:33.333
All right. so tell us
then about...

920
00:43:33.367 --> 00:43:34.733
What are habitable zones?

921
00:43:34.767 --> 00:43:36.367
Right. so the habitable zone.

922
00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:37.833
is kind of an old idea.

923
00:43:37.867 --> 00:43:41.567
because we thought about
the habitable zone as
where life may form

924
00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:43.267
and where life
may be found.

925
00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:45.167
But like I said.
we now know

926
00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:46.933
that life is not formed.

927
00:43:46.967 --> 00:43:48.367
And what this
has to do with is

928
00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:50.800
how far away
the planet is from its star

929
00:43:50.833 --> 00:43:53.400
so it can have liquid
water on its surface.

930
00:43:53.433 --> 00:43:54.633
Now...

931
00:43:54.667 --> 00:43:56.900
What this doesn't tell you is
what's the light conditions

932
00:43:56.933 --> 00:43:58.200
on the surface of the star.

933
00:43:58.233 --> 00:44:00.600
So. here on earth
something really
special happened.

934
00:44:00.633 --> 00:44:02.067
Whereas most planets

935
00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:03.133
where you're going
to find liquid.

936
00:44:03.167 --> 00:44:04.633
they're going to be
under thick atmospheres

937
00:44:04.667 --> 00:44:06.633
or miles of ice.
or miles of rock.

938
00:44:06.667 --> 00:44:09.167
On earth we have
a transparent atmosphere.

939
00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:11.667
So. we have an ocean.
with early life in it.

940
00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:14.133
you mix it up
and shine energy on it

941
00:44:14.167 --> 00:44:16.933
-for four billion years.
what do you get?
-Mmm-hmm.

942
00:44:16.967 --> 00:44:19.600
Eventually. that life learns
to use that light

943
00:44:19.633 --> 00:44:20.733
to create oxygen.

944
00:44:20.767 --> 00:44:22.500
which is deadly
to early life.

945
00:44:22.533 --> 00:44:26.133
but it allows
and sets the stage for
life like ourselves.

946
00:44:26.167 --> 00:44:28.567
So. a habitable zone

947
00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:31.600
is where you can
have an explosion of life

948
00:44:31.633 --> 00:44:34.600
that can lead to intelligent
and technologically
advanced life.

949
00:44:34.633 --> 00:44:36.967
So. someone flipped the
lights on and it's go time.

950
00:44:37.067 --> 00:44:38.833
That's right.
After a few billion years.

951
00:44:38.867 --> 00:44:40.533
After... Yeah.
Give or take. yeah.

952
00:44:40.567 --> 00:44:43.333
Thanks for your time. Dr. O.
Josh. back to you.

953
00:44:43.367 --> 00:44:44.733
Thanks. Jessica and Dr. O.

954
00:44:44.767 --> 00:44:47.567
Now turning from science
to science fiction.

955
00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:50.233
One of the longest running
and popular tv shows

956
00:44:50.267 --> 00:44:53.067
in sci-fi history
was The X-files.

957
00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:55.500
The show's creator.
Chris Carter spoke candidly

958
00:44:55.533 --> 00:44:57.800
about the Pentagon report
and the possibility of

959
00:44:57.833 --> 00:44:59.667
life beyond earth.

960
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:05.067
People asked me
what I believe

961
00:45:05.067 --> 00:45:07.800
in the UFO phenomenon
and alien abduction
phenomenon.

962
00:45:07.833 --> 00:45:10.133
and I'm kind of a hybrid
of Mulder and Scully.

963
00:45:10.167 --> 00:45:13.600
Like Mulder I want to believe
like that poster on his wall.

964
00:45:13.633 --> 00:45:16.067
and like Scully.
I want to see the science.

965
00:45:16.067 --> 00:45:18.167
Uh. I'm skeptical by nature.

966
00:45:19.733 --> 00:45:21.500
For me the videos
are exciting.

967
00:45:21.533 --> 00:45:25.167
That on modern equipment
and with modern technology

968
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.067
We are capturing something

969
00:45:27.067 --> 00:45:29.300
that is out there.
and it's behaving

970
00:45:29.333 --> 00:45:32.333
in a strange
and mysterious manner.

971
00:45:32.367 --> 00:45:34.300
This is a really exciting time

972
00:45:34.333 --> 00:45:36.767
We may or may not learn
what these things are.

973
00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:39.533
but I think it's...
recent studies
and recent sightings

974
00:45:39.567 --> 00:45:40.367
have pushed things forward.

975
00:45:42.467 --> 00:45:45.833
i think our reactions
to the UFO videos
are healthy.

976
00:45:45.867 --> 00:45:48.767
The pilots. for me.
seem unimpeachable.

977
00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:51.300
What they gathered
from their avionics

978
00:45:51.333 --> 00:45:53.833
or radar
seems beyond doubt

979
00:45:53.867 --> 00:45:54.967
that they saw those things.

980
00:45:55.067 --> 00:45:56.933
and that their reactions
to them are real.

981
00:45:56.967 --> 00:45:58.767
[man] Oh! Got him!

982
00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:02.233
[Chris] So the X-Files.
and the subject matter
and UFOs

983
00:46:02.267 --> 00:46:05.833
are being some credence
that they might not have
had before.

984
00:46:05.867 --> 00:46:08.133
You know. I believe that we
don't have answers.

985
00:46:08.167 --> 00:46:10.067
I believe that we're searching
for answers.

986
00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:13.533
I believe that there are
the possibility of
alien life out there.

987
00:46:13.567 --> 00:46:16.233
Like Carl Sagan
who actually said.

988
00:46:16.267 --> 00:46:18.067
you know. "There's more
chance than not."

989
00:46:18.067 --> 00:46:20.367
And now we've discovered
since the '90s

990
00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:23.833
there are these
exoplanets revolving
around their own suns.

991
00:46:23.867 --> 00:46:27.633
The chance is
even greater now there is
life on these planets.

992
00:46:31.533 --> 00:46:34.467
The truth is out there.
We've asked for your tweets.

993
00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:37.867
photos and footage.
Let's see who answered
the call.

994
00:46:39.533 --> 00:46:42.267
Artemis here says.
"Do you think we'll meet

995
00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:44.800
actual aliens
in our lifetime?"

996
00:46:44.833 --> 00:46:47.200
Nick. what are your thoughts
on that?

997
00:46:47.233 --> 00:46:49.800
I hope so. I think ours
will be the generation

998
00:46:49.833 --> 00:46:51.633
that makes that discovery
whether it's through

999
00:46:51.667 --> 00:46:54.667
-science or UFOs or both.
-Fantastic.

1000
00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:57.767
Asked and answered.
Don't be shy about sending us

1001
00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:01.567
your questions using
the #UFOsDeclassifiedLIVE.

1002
00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:03.733
Josh. take it away.

1003
00:47:03.767 --> 00:47:07.900
Well. coming up. we will be
screening the entire footage

1004
00:47:07.933 --> 00:47:10.867
that got the entire
pentagon report rolling.

1005
00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:14.333
Plus our experts will debate
the origins of the UAPs

1006
00:47:14.367 --> 00:47:17.967
when UFOs Declassified:
LIVE returns.

1007
00:47:37.267 --> 00:47:40.867
Welcome back to
UFOs Declassified: LIVE.

1008
00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:43.467
I'm Josh Gates. Personally.
I have been blown away

1009
00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:45.067
by what we've seen so far.

1010
00:47:45.067 --> 00:47:47.467
And man. we are
just warming up.
There is so much more.

1011
00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:49.867
Earlier this year.
the pentagon confirmed

1012
00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:53.667
that one of the most
intriguing UFO videos
on record.

1013
00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:57.133
footage of a mysterious
triangular airborne craft.

1014
00:47:57.167 --> 00:48:00.367
sourced by our own
Jeremy Corbell here
back in 2019

1015
00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:02.533
is indeed authentic.

1016
00:48:02.567 --> 00:48:06.100
Check this out. This is
the pyramid-shaped UFO.

1017
00:48:07.233 --> 00:48:09.267
All right. Walk me
through this. Jeremy.

1018
00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:10.767
-What are we looking at?
-[Jeremy] Sure.

1019
00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.800
So. George and I obtained
and released.

1020
00:48:12.833 --> 00:48:17.267
this is night vision through
a night vision binocular
on board of the USS Russell.

1021
00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:21.100
There are pyramid-shaped UFOs.
numerous of them.

1022
00:48:21.133 --> 00:48:23.300
Three of them
were about 700 feet.

1023
00:48:23.333 --> 00:48:25.067
They are slow
and go with the ship.

1024
00:48:25.067 --> 00:48:27.700
[Josh] Oh. look at that.
It's not just one object.
It's multiple objects there.

1025
00:48:27.733 --> 00:48:29.533
[Jeremy] Right. One is
blinking and there's been

1026
00:48:29.567 --> 00:48:32.633
a lot of thought about that.
is this just the UFO blinking

1027
00:48:32.667 --> 00:48:34.433
or is this reflection
from a surface

1028
00:48:34.467 --> 00:48:36.633
and the blinking is something
from the ship.

1029
00:48:36.667 --> 00:48:39.633
We don't know. But these are
pyramid-shaped UFOs.

1030
00:48:39.667 --> 00:48:42.467
swarming a Navy warship.
USS Russell.

1031
00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:45.200
[Josh] Absolutely
incredible footage.

1032
00:48:45.233 --> 00:48:49.133
It's just mind bending because
you look at it and you think.

1033
00:48:49.167 --> 00:48:50.800
"What am I looking at here?"

1034
00:48:50.833 --> 00:48:55.167
[Jeremy] Confirmed
by the pentagon not.
only filmed by our military.

1035
00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:58.500
but also to be included
as an unknown unidentified.

1036
00:48:58.533 --> 00:49:00.267
They're UFOs
and they're admitting it.

1037
00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:02.533
Okay. so this footage
gets even crazier

1038
00:49:02.567 --> 00:49:04.900
because as amazing as this is.

1039
00:49:04.933 --> 00:49:09.067
this footage
was taken by the USS Russell
off the coast of San Diego

1040
00:49:09.067 --> 00:49:13.133
at the same exact same time.
nearby the USS Omaha

1041
00:49:13.167 --> 00:49:16.967
detected its own swarm
of unidentified objects.

1042
00:49:17.067 --> 00:49:20.467
Take a look at their radar
and give a listen
to the reaction

1043
00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:23.333
of the military personnel.
This is amazing.

1044
00:49:23.367 --> 00:49:26.833
[man 1] If you can ride
a general that long
where we're at.

1045
00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:32.367
The number of contacts
you got. speed meters off.

1046
00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:35.200
-Yeah.
-Roll that position to us.

1047
00:49:36.067 --> 00:49:40.233
Eyes up. eyes up.

1048
00:49:41.333 --> 00:49:44.600
[indistinct radio chatter]

1049
00:49:46.767 --> 00:49:51.433
781 just sped up
to 46 knots. 50 knots.

1050
00:49:51.467 --> 00:49:54.067
closing in.

1051
00:49:56.967 --> 00:49:59.100
38 knots.
what the [bleep] is that?

1052
00:49:59.133 --> 00:50:02.800
-That one's pretty much
perfectly 000 relative. right?
-Yeah.

1053
00:50:03.433 --> 00:50:05.267
263 in three miles.

1054
00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:08.300
55 knots speed.

1055
00:50:08.333 --> 00:50:11.400
All right. This just makes
my head hurt because.
you know. I have to say

1056
00:50:11.433 --> 00:50:15.900
I am a skeptically
minded person. but I look
at the pyramid footage

1057
00:50:15.933 --> 00:50:17.467
and I think. okay.
that's intriguing.

1058
00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:19.800
Then I look at the radar
from the Omaha nearby.

1059
00:50:19.833 --> 00:50:21.233
Now I really don't know
what to think.

1060
00:50:21.267 --> 00:50:23.300
And it gets even crazier.

1061
00:50:23.333 --> 00:50:26.633
I'm going to show you now
flair footage taken
from the Omaha.

1062
00:50:26.667 --> 00:50:31.100
It's a different view of one
of the UAP involved
in the radar swarm.

1063
00:50:31.133 --> 00:50:34.633
Give a listen to this.
It is really exciting.

1064
00:50:34.667 --> 00:50:40.833
Omaha. across the possibility
to launch kilo ASAP.

1065
00:50:41.733 --> 00:50:45.467
We're splashing apparently.

1066
00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:47.967
-Keep going. bro.
-[indistinct chatter]

1067
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.933
We're making that [bleep].

1068
00:50:52.267 --> 00:50:54.267
Yeah. it's coming down.

1069
00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:56.967
We got some water up there.
six foot twelves.

1070
00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.500
Well. it's getting close.

1071
00:51:02.533 --> 00:51:08.967
Damn. we have
uh. 31 knots sustained.
wind topside. gusts of 40.

1072
00:51:09.067 --> 00:51:13.067
-It splashed.
-Splashed. Bearing a range.

1073
00:51:13.067 --> 00:51:15.700
-So. it goes in the water.
-Yeah.

1074
00:51:15.733 --> 00:51:18.767
It's suspected that it goes
into the water like
a transmedian vehicle.

1075
00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:20.933
They're not exactly sure.
but they did send out

1076
00:51:20.967 --> 00:51:23.167
-a submarine to look for it.
-So walk me through this term

1077
00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:25.467
'cause I've heard this
before. a transmedia vehicle.

1078
00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:27.500
This means it can be
in the air and underwater.

1079
00:51:27.533 --> 00:51:29.600
Right. So something that can
penetrate the space

1080
00:51:29.633 --> 00:51:32.967
between air and sea
without disturbance.

1081
00:51:33.067 --> 00:51:34.400
without destruction.

1082
00:51:34.433 --> 00:51:37.167
It's just remarkable to see it
do that.

1083
00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:41.767
Nick. is it possible that
what appears to be an object
going into the water here

1084
00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:46.267
is some sort of. I don't know.
stealth technology.
optical illusion?

1085
00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:49.067
Well. I wonder if it isn't
like the old magician's trick.

1086
00:51:49.067 --> 00:51:51.067
if doing something
with one hand.

1087
00:51:51.067 --> 00:51:53.733
but the real action
is going on in the other.

1088
00:51:53.767 --> 00:51:56.067
And. I mean.
this is extraordinary.

1089
00:51:56.067 --> 00:52:00.833
But in 2018. the defense
intelligence agency
wrote to Congress

1090
00:52:00.867 --> 00:52:05.067
about a number of studies
being undertaken under
the Pentagon's A-tip program.

1091
00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:08.367
And in there were all this
advanced theoretical
physical concepts

1092
00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:11.967
such as warp drives.
worm holes and invisibility.

1093
00:52:12.067 --> 00:52:14.867
And we mentioned
this submarine.
they did send a submarine

1094
00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:17.133
-down to look for this thing?
-Yes. 'cause understand.

1095
00:52:17.167 --> 00:52:21.067
This was a swarm.
There were multiple UFOs
across many ships.

1096
00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:24.367
And so when they see this one
that goes or appears
to go into the water.

1097
00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:26.100
they wanted to find
the wreckage of the craft.

1098
00:52:26.133 --> 00:52:28.767
I have to say. as compelling
as the report is.

1099
00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:33.067
this sequence
of this flair footage.
the radar footage.

1100
00:52:33.067 --> 00:52:35.767
the night vision.
it's just so interesting.

1101
00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:38.767
Okay. And also.
unidentified objects.

1102
00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:42.533
they are not just something
that are appearing
in the United States.

1103
00:52:42.567 --> 00:52:46.900
Up next. we're going to
investigate UAP sightings
from around the globe.

1104
00:52:46.933 --> 00:52:49.533
Plus. we have got some
phenomenal new footage

1105
00:52:49.567 --> 00:52:52.733
from the deck of the Omaha
which checks all the boxes.

1106
00:52:52.767 --> 00:52:55.933
And maybe the final piece
of evidence our experts need

1107
00:52:55.967 --> 00:52:59.433
to nail down whether
these UAPs are adversary.

1108
00:52:59.467 --> 00:53:02.767
extraterrestrial or
something else entirely.

1109
00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:06.500
And later. we'll be joined
by none other
than the head of NASA.

1110
00:53:31.667 --> 00:53:34.233
Welcome back to
UFOs Declassified: LIVE.

1111
00:53:34.267 --> 00:53:35.733
I'm your host Josh Gates.

1112
00:53:35.767 --> 00:53:40.167
The footage of pyramid-shaped
UFOs may be relatively new
to many of us.

1113
00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:44.167
but actually pyramid videos
have been around
for quite a while.

1114
00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:46.100
In fact. our own George Knapp

1115
00:53:46.133 --> 00:53:50.800
smuggled some pyramid
UFO footage out of Russia
several few years ago.

1116
00:53:50.833 --> 00:53:54.400
Let's go to Jessica
and the man himself
to talk about it. Jess?

1117
00:53:54.433 --> 00:53:57.167
Thanks. Josh.
George. let's talk a look
at your pyramid video

1118
00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:59.500
-and you can tell me about it.
-Okay.

1119
00:53:59.533 --> 00:54:01.233
So what have we got here?

1120
00:54:01.267 --> 00:54:04.167
This is a huge pyramid-shaped
object. not triangle.

1121
00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:08.367
but pyramid that was shot
over the skies of Latvia
in 1968.

1122
00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.467
It ended up in
the ministry of defense.

1123
00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:13.600
Russia's ministry of defense
had giant files on UFOs

1124
00:54:13.633 --> 00:54:16.567
that I tried
to access in the early '90s.

1125
00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:18.567
You might recall
during the early '90s.

1126
00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:22.167
Glasnost. Perestroika.
that country was undergoing
a lot of changes

1127
00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:24.467
and I thought maybe there's
a window of opportunity

1128
00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:26.767
to find out what the Russians
know about UFOs

1129
00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:30.067
and also. what the Americans
know about UFOs
from the Russians.

1130
00:54:30.067 --> 00:54:33.300
And we went over there
with the help
of a Russian physicist

1131
00:54:33.333 --> 00:54:35.267
who had government contacts.

1132
00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:38.967
He put us in touch with
ministry of defense officials
and intelligence officials

1133
00:54:39.067 --> 00:54:41.867
and they told us about the
biggest UFO study in history.

1134
00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:43.633
It was ten-year long study.

1135
00:54:43.667 --> 00:54:45.700
The whole Russian military
was part of it.

1136
00:54:45.733 --> 00:54:49.267
They had collected tens
of thousands of reports.
including videos.

1137
00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:51.367
and I was able to get
some of that material.

1138
00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:54.200
-classified as it was.
and bring it back.
-Very interesting.

1139
00:54:54.233 --> 00:54:57.867
I wanted to zoom in on this
a little bit so we can
get a better view.

1140
00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:00.467
Oh. I need that to go. Ooh.

1141
00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:01.600
No. my zoom is not working.

1142
00:55:01.633 --> 00:55:04.367
So. how did you manage
to smuggle this out of Russia?

1143
00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:05.867
I think I'm gonna be vague
about that

1144
00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:08.633
-because someday I might want
to go back to Russia.
-[laughs] Nice.

1145
00:55:08.667 --> 00:55:12.067
Yeah. but it was
a very tense moment.
I'll just put it that way.

1146
00:55:12.067 --> 00:55:14.433
But they consider this
to be a genuine UFO

1147
00:55:14.467 --> 00:55:17.267
because of some
of the characteristics
of how it flew.

1148
00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:19.433
even though we don't see it
in this film clip.

1149
00:55:19.467 --> 00:55:22.267
But it was part
of a gigantic cache
of information

1150
00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:25.067
that the ministry of defense
collected over
a ten-year period.

1151
00:55:25.067 --> 00:55:28.467
-How long ago was this
particular footage taken?
-That's 1968.

1152
00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:31.167
Latvia which was sort of
part of the USSR back then.

1153
00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:34.867
The USSR crumbled
and the Russians took over.

1154
00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:36.100
but that was in their files.

1155
00:55:36.133 --> 00:55:38.700
So obviously there's been
video documentation

1156
00:55:38.733 --> 00:55:41.900
of pyramid-shaped UFOs
for over 50 years.

1157
00:55:41.933 --> 00:55:46.267
Why do you think people
are only talking and paying
attention about it now?

1158
00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:47.967
It's kind of
a combination of events.

1159
00:55:48.067 --> 00:55:50.133
You know. there's always
something more important
in your life.

1160
00:55:50.167 --> 00:55:53.667
the economy. your family.
whatever. you know. politics.

1161
00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:58.367
And now we've had such
an avalanche of UFO coverage
by main stream media

1162
00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:01.533
that it's caught the attention
of the public in a way

1163
00:56:01.567 --> 00:56:03.300
that I never thought
I would see in my life.

1164
00:56:03.333 --> 00:56:06.200
That's great. Well. right now
we're going to do
a side-by-side comparison

1165
00:56:06.233 --> 00:56:09.567
of your footage
and the footage from 2019.

1166
00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:11.567
So let's pull that up.

1167
00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:13.633
So what I think is really
interesting about this

1168
00:56:13.667 --> 00:56:16.767
is over here from Latvia.
you kind of have
a beveled edge.

1169
00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:19.167
It's all by itself
and it's kind of
staying perfectly still.

1170
00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:21.900
Over here. you've got
multiple shaped UFOs

1171
00:56:21.933 --> 00:56:24.800
or multiple
triangle-shaped UFOs

1172
00:56:24.833 --> 00:56:26.933
as well as the fact
that it's pulsing.

1173
00:56:26.967 --> 00:56:29.333
Yeah. this guy.
the pyramid over here

1174
00:56:29.367 --> 00:56:31.067
brought his buddies
along with him.

1175
00:56:31.067 --> 00:56:33.200
If you notice. if you watch
the footage close enough.

1176
00:56:33.233 --> 00:56:34.700
they're not traveling
all at once.

1177
00:56:34.733 --> 00:56:37.100
It's not a reflection.
those two different objects

1178
00:56:37.133 --> 00:56:42.100
are paced at a different pace
than the main object
that we see that's flashing.

1179
00:56:42.133 --> 00:56:43.900
This guy came by himself.

1180
00:56:43.933 --> 00:56:45.900
Would you say
just off the top of your head.

1181
00:56:45.933 --> 00:56:47.367
could they potentially
be related

1182
00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:49.733
and this is just a more
advanced version
of whatever this was?

1183
00:56:49.767 --> 00:56:51.300
Yeah. that's a good thought.

1184
00:56:51.333 --> 00:56:54.600
I mean. it was 30 years
in between. so it's possible.
40 years in between.

1185
00:56:54.633 --> 00:56:59.067
so it's possible that the same
kind of technology is
reflected in those film clips.

1186
00:56:59.067 --> 00:57:01.533
Interesting. I'd say
yours holds up.

1187
00:57:01.567 --> 00:57:04.400
Thank you very much. George.
Back to you. Josh.

1188
00:57:04.433 --> 00:57:07.600
Absolutely incredible stuff.
For the kids watching at home.

1189
00:57:07.633 --> 00:57:10.067
don't smuggle UFO videos
out of Russia.

1190
00:57:10.067 --> 00:57:11.667
It's a bold move. George.

1191
00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:15.233
Look. the fact he was able
to smuggle this footage out
proves this next point.

1192
00:57:15.267 --> 00:57:18.833
These UAPs. they are
a worldwide concern.

1193
00:57:18.867 --> 00:57:20.633
So far we have focused
on sightings

1194
00:57:20.667 --> 00:57:24.067
off the Florida
and California coast here
in the United States.

1195
00:57:24.067 --> 00:57:26.967
but the phenomena extends
all around the globe.

1196
00:57:27.067 --> 00:57:28.300
Let's take a look.

1197
00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:33.267
[Nick] UFOs are
a global phenomenon.

1198
00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:37.600
While the current spotlight
is on the United States.

1199
00:57:37.633 --> 00:57:41.633
there is more to this
than just those three
U.S. Navy videos.

1200
00:57:41.667 --> 00:57:43.067
[man] My gosh.

1201
00:57:43.067 --> 00:57:44.933
[man speaking other language]

1202
00:57:50.933 --> 00:57:53.733
[Tom] I think when it comes
to UFOs. it's a global issue.

1203
00:57:53.767 --> 00:57:56.433
It's a humanity issue.
What I've seen
with other countries

1204
00:57:56.467 --> 00:58:00.633
is pretty interesting.
Every country
for the most part

1205
00:58:00.667 --> 00:58:04.300
has their own UFO program.
They're much more open

1206
00:58:04.333 --> 00:58:07.400
with their population
on these things than we are.

1207
00:58:07.433 --> 00:58:10.267
But we're really
kind of waiting for us
to take the lead.

1208
00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:16.433
I think it would be safe
to say that most
world governments

1209
00:58:16.467 --> 00:58:19.933
have encountered this UAP
phenomenon without a doubt.

1210
00:58:19.967 --> 00:58:21.200
It appears everywhere.

1211
00:58:22.067 --> 00:58:24.133
[Jim] But
we can't predict

1212
00:58:24.167 --> 00:58:25.600
when they're going to appear.

1213
00:58:25.633 --> 00:58:26.833
why they're going to appear

1214
00:58:26.867 --> 00:58:28.600
and where they're
going to appear.

1215
00:58:28.633 --> 00:58:30.967
But we do know that
there are some governments.

1216
00:58:31.067 --> 00:58:34.700
particularly in Brazil.
Argentina. Chile. Peru.

1217
00:58:34.733 --> 00:58:38.233
France. the UK. Australia.

1218
00:58:38.267 --> 00:58:40.067
all of these countries

1219
00:58:40.067 --> 00:58:42.667
have information
on these sightings.

1220
00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:44.333
[Keith] It seems
very simple to say

1221
00:58:44.367 --> 00:58:47.400
"Why don't all the countries
of the world cooperate.

1222
00:58:47.433 --> 00:58:48.400
be friends."

1223
00:58:48.433 --> 00:58:50.800
and until there is a global

1224
00:58:50.833 --> 00:58:53.500
acknowledgment of the threat.

1225
00:58:53.533 --> 00:58:57.300
it seems unlikely
that there will be
significant cooperation.

1226
00:59:01.567 --> 00:59:02.967
Incredibly enlightening stuff.

1227
00:59:03.067 --> 00:59:04.633
I think it begs
the question also.

1228
00:59:04.667 --> 00:59:07.933
if these UAPs are being
spotted around the world.

1229
00:59:07.967 --> 00:59:09.567
does that bolster
the theory that

1230
00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:11.700
perhaps
they're extraterrestrials.

1231
00:59:11.733 --> 00:59:13.800
Joining us is Nick Pope.

1232
00:59:13.833 --> 00:59:15.767
Nick. let me ask you this.
these global sightings.

1233
00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:18.100
are they largely similar?

1234
00:59:18.133 --> 00:59:19.733
There are similarities. yes.

1235
00:59:19.767 --> 00:59:23.333
Um. in shape.
in sudden accelerations.

1236
00:59:23.367 --> 00:59:26.167
in the ability to go through
the sound barrier

1237
00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:27.233
with no sonic boom.

1238
00:59:27.267 --> 00:59:28.900
I mean.
this is a global phenomenon.

1239
00:59:28.933 --> 00:59:30.567
Everything I know from
my government work

1240
00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:32.900
tells me there are sightings
around the world.

1241
00:59:32.933 --> 00:59:37.100
programs usually embedded in
DODs and air forces.

1242
00:59:37.133 --> 00:59:39.067
and if anyone says.
as skeptics occasionally do

1243
00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:40.833
why aren't there any sightings

1244
00:59:40.867 --> 00:59:42.467
in this country
or that country.

1245
00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:44.500
it's usually
because the politics.

1246
00:59:44.533 --> 00:59:45.933
the language. the culture.

1247
00:59:45.967 --> 00:59:48.533
The sightings are there.
we're just not
hearing about them.

1248
00:59:48.567 --> 00:59:51.300
You know.
one of the most mind boggling

1249
00:59:51.333 --> 00:59:53.600
international sightings
that I've ever seen

1250
00:59:53.633 --> 00:59:55.667
is this sighting from...
from Puerto Rico.

1251
00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:56.667
Take a look at this.

1252
00:59:58.867 --> 01:00:02.000
We have this incident
where we have this object
is being tracked

1253
01:00:02.033 --> 01:00:03.500
and it is flying along.

1254
01:00:03.533 --> 01:00:06.833
Jeremy. tell us a little bit
about what's going to
happen here.

1255
01:00:06.867 --> 01:00:09.700
[Jeremy]
Well. what you see is like
a trans medium vehicle.

1256
01:00:09.733 --> 01:00:12.833
it's a vehicle that goes
from the air
through the water

1257
01:00:12.867 --> 01:00:15.067
without decelerating at all.

1258
01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:16.933
it also at one point
splits in two.

1259
01:00:16.967 --> 01:00:18.967
And this was
filmed by the. uh...

1260
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.600
Homeland Security was
the original place
it was filmed from.

1261
01:00:21.633 --> 01:00:24.600
So. it's a pretty astounding
piece of clear footage.

1262
01:00:24.633 --> 01:00:28.500
[Josh] This moment where
it appears to beak in two.
though right here.

1263
01:00:28.533 --> 01:00:29.900
this is really astounding.

1264
01:00:29.933 --> 01:00:32.533
The object literally--
It's like a magic trick.

1265
01:00:32.567 --> 01:00:34.833
We have this one object
that suddenly becomes

1266
01:00:34.867 --> 01:00:37.667
two objects just in
the blink of an eye.

1267
01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:39.000
[Jeremy] It was highly studied

1268
01:00:39.033 --> 01:00:40.733
and the fact that it moves
through the water

1269
01:00:40.767 --> 01:00:43.000
without deceleration
that again shows that

1270
01:00:43.033 --> 01:00:46.067
trans medium characteristic
that UFOs are known for.

1271
01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:48.133
Because most objects
that are travelling
at a high speed.

1272
01:00:48.167 --> 01:00:50.567
that are aerial.
they hit the water.
it over right?

1273
01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:52.133
They slow down.
they stop.

1274
01:00:52.167 --> 01:00:53.900
There's a huge amount of drag
and friction.

1275
01:00:53.933 --> 01:00:55.433
This thing keeps going.

1276
01:00:55.467 --> 01:00:58.700
That's right. And that's due
most likely to
the propulsion system itself.

1277
01:00:58.733 --> 01:01:02.300
Any evidence this footage
could be doctored?

1278
01:01:02.333 --> 01:01:04.233
This footage? No.

1279
01:01:04.267 --> 01:01:06.133
-[Josh] Do you see any
evidence of that George?
-[George] No.

1280
01:01:06.167 --> 01:01:08.833
The STU. a really
reputable organization.

1281
01:01:08.867 --> 01:01:10.800
they did an analysis
of this over several months.

1282
01:01:10.833 --> 01:01:12.533
they studied
every frame of it.

1283
01:01:12.567 --> 01:01:14.067
they believe it
to be legitimate

1284
01:01:14.067 --> 01:01:15.767
and they don't
have an explanation

1285
01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:17.933
for how one object
splits into two.

1286
01:01:17.967 --> 01:01:21.633
and they're both still
flying under some
controlled circumstances.

1287
01:01:21.667 --> 01:01:23.367
You know. one of the things
here in the Unites States.

1288
01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:24.900
historically has been
that our government

1289
01:01:24.933 --> 01:01:28.200
has been tight lipped
about UFO activity.

1290
01:01:28.233 --> 01:01:30.733
I'm curious. as we talk about
these global sightings.

1291
01:01:30.767 --> 01:01:33.200
how is this handled
in other countries
around the world?

1292
01:01:33.233 --> 01:01:35.800
Most of them seem to follow
the United States model.

1293
01:01:35.833 --> 01:01:37.167
Our allies certainly
follow that.

1294
01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:39.467
I think the UK takes its
cues from the US.

1295
01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:41.833
That they say one thing
behind the scenes

1296
01:01:41.867 --> 01:01:43.733
scenes and something else
to the public.

1297
01:01:43.767 --> 01:01:45.100
That certainly was true
for Russia.

1298
01:01:45.133 --> 01:01:47.600
They told their people
for decades.

1299
01:01:47.633 --> 01:01:49.167
that this was
a capitalist plot.

1300
01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:51.133
Pay no attention
to these UFOs.

1301
01:01:51.167 --> 01:01:52.867
Behind the scenes they were
studying it.

1302
01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:54.167
-for very practical reasons...
-[Josh] Right.

1303
01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:56.067
...trying to figure out
how to make their own.

1304
01:01:56.067 --> 01:01:58.367
One of the things I saw.
I went to Chile
a few years ago.

1305
01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:01.567
and they had a program there
that was actually quite
open to the public.

1306
01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.433
They were encouraging
people to come forward.

1307
01:02:03.467 --> 01:02:05.067
encouraging pilots
to come forward.

1308
01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:07.900
I think whether you're
a believer or skeptic.

1309
01:02:07.933 --> 01:02:10.800
just for the sake
of national security

1310
01:02:10.833 --> 01:02:12.833
or the sake of anybody
who gets in an airplane.

1311
01:02:12.867 --> 01:02:15.600
surely there's
got to be real value
to encouraging people

1312
01:02:15.633 --> 01:02:16.567
to report these things.

1313
01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:17.433
Here's the thing.

1314
01:02:17.467 --> 01:02:19.233
we're in a race for this
technology.

1315
01:02:19.267 --> 01:02:21.333
United States wants it.
UK wants it.

1316
01:02:21.367 --> 01:02:22.933
Russia wants it.
China wants it.

1317
01:02:22.967 --> 01:02:26.567
And the first nation to figure
this stuff out wins.

1318
01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:28.600
All right. well.
thank you everybody.
very informative.

1319
01:02:28.633 --> 01:02:30.167
Coming up.
our panel of experts

1320
01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:32.467
will be breaking down
more key videos

1321
01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:34.767
as we debate whether
these UAPs are

1322
01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.933
adversaries. extraterrestrials

1323
01:02:36.967 --> 01:02:38.467
or something else entirely.

1324
01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:40.700
And later in the show.
we are going to learn about

1325
01:02:40.733 --> 01:02:43.600
arguably the most
groundbreaking
cosmic discovery

1326
01:02:43.633 --> 01:02:44.967
of the century.

1327
01:02:45.067 --> 01:02:48.100
Plus we'll hear more from
the producer and creator
of The X-Files.

1328

[Josh] Welcome back to
UFOs Declassified Live.

1331
01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:23.067
Looking at our twitter poll.

1332
01:03:23.067 --> 01:03:26.433
a whopping 89.4% of you

1333
01:03:26.467 --> 01:03:30.067
believe that there is
life outside our solar system.

1334
01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:32.067
We're winning over hearts
and minds tonight.

1335
01:03:32.067 --> 01:03:34.067
Uh. welcome back to the show.
I'm Josh Gates.

1336
01:03:34.067 --> 01:03:36.067
We are getting closer
to the final verdict

1337
01:03:36.067 --> 01:03:38.500
on the Pentagon's
groundbreaking report.

1338
01:03:38.533 --> 01:03:41.567
Bow this next piece of footage
checks a lot of boxes.

1339
01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:44.533
In 2015.
on the USS Theodore Roosevelt.

1340
01:03:44.567 --> 01:03:47.167
the navy captured what's
come to be known as

1341
01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:50.333
"Go fast" video.
off the coast of Florida.

1342
01:03:50.367 --> 01:03:51.433
Check this out.[

1343
01:04:02.733 --> 01:04:04.067
[indistinct radio chatter]

1344
01:04:04.067 --> 01:04:06.667
[man] Whoa! Got him.
[laughing]

1345
01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:08.800
-Whoo-hoo.
-[man 2] Roger...

1346
01:04:08.833 --> 01:04:11.133
Are you [bleep] see in this?

1347
01:04:11.167 --> 01:04:12.700
What is that?

1348
01:04:12.733 --> 01:04:13.900
Can you track?
It's a moving target.

1349
01:04:15.067 --> 01:04:16.233
[man 2]
No. I took an autotrack.

1350
01:04:16.267 --> 01:04:17.900
[man 2] Oh. okay.

1351
01:04:17.933 --> 01:04:20.200
Oh. my gosh. dude. Wow.

1352
01:04:20.233 --> 01:04:22.333
-[man 2] What is that?
-Look at it fly!

1353
01:04:22.367 --> 01:04:23.633
[laughing]

1354
01:04:26.167 --> 01:04:27.967
All right. Well. joining us
on the panel now

1355
01:04:28.067 --> 01:04:31.067
is former director of the CIA
office of technical service.

1356
01:04:31.067 --> 01:04:32.900
Please welcome. Bob Wallace.
How are you. sir?

1357
01:04:32.933 --> 01:04:34.167
It's an honor
to be here. Josh.

1358
01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:35.767
Well. it's an honor
to have you here.

1359
01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:37.233
Uh. you know.
let's start with this.

1360
01:04:37.267 --> 01:04:38.567
What... what is the likelihood

1361
01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.967
that a foreign adversary
would be developing

1362
01:04:41.067 --> 01:04:43.933
technology like this without
the US knowing it.

1363
01:04:43.967 --> 01:04:47.233
Josh. if we were
doing our job.
we would know it. Right?

1364
01:04:47.267 --> 01:04:49.933
That's...
That's the whole
purpose of intelligence.

1365
01:04:49.967 --> 01:04:52.533
It's. uh. find out what
the adversary is doing.

1366
01:04:52.567 --> 01:04:55.533
find it out soon
and get it to people

1367
01:04:55.567 --> 01:04:56.767
who can make the decision.

1368
01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:00.900
Now. with respect to
UAPs specifically.

1369
01:05:00.933 --> 01:05:03.900
if I could use
this illustration...

1370
01:05:03.933 --> 01:05:08.833
Uh. this piece of paper
represents all possible

1371
01:05:08.867 --> 01:05:11.800
information about UAPs.

1372
01:05:11.833 --> 01:05:16.067
Okay. This dot represents
what we know.

1373
01:05:16.067 --> 01:05:20.067
So. I caution us against being
too arrogant.

1374
01:05:20.067 --> 01:05:21.200
Wow. amazing.

1375
01:05:21.233 --> 01:05:23.467
We really blew our budget on
that visual aid there too.

1376
01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:25.833
But I take your point.
We don't know much
at this point.

1377
01:05:25.867 --> 01:05:27.367
There's a lot we don't know.

1378
01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:30.067
Uh. so. okay. we've got
eyewitness testimony.

1379
01:05:30.067 --> 01:05:31.800
We've got video.
We've got radar.

1380
01:05:31.833 --> 01:05:34.267
We've got movement.
We've got propulsion
in this last video.

1381
01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:36.933
I mean. this one seems to
check all the boxes.

1382
01:05:36.967 --> 01:05:40.567
I turn now to Tracy.
our resident
fighter pilot here.

1383
01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:42.967
What do you make of
the "Go fast" video?

1384
01:05:43.067 --> 01:05:44.233
What jumps out at you?

1385
01:05:44.267 --> 01:05:46.500
I think the video
is incredible.

1386
01:05:46.533 --> 01:05:48.633
As fighter pilots we think
that we're fast.

1387
01:05:48.667 --> 01:05:51.900
but this object looks like
it is going super-fast.

1388
01:05:51.933 --> 01:05:53.733
So. that's what I wanna
talk about here.

1389
01:05:53.767 --> 01:05:56.333
Compare it for me
to a fighter jet.

1390
01:05:56.367 --> 01:05:59.667
you know. how difficult is it
to even track
an object like this?

1391
01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:01.800
Well. you can see
it looks like they're
working pretty hard

1392
01:06:01.833 --> 01:06:03.067
to get a lock.

1393
01:06:03.067 --> 01:06:07.133
And at first glance we might
think that it's many objects

1394
01:06:07.167 --> 01:06:09.267
going across
that particular screen.

1395
01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:12.967
But when I look closer.
it looks like they're
trying to grab it

1396
01:06:13.067 --> 01:06:14.233
and then it breaks lock.

1397
01:06:14.267 --> 01:06:15.967
and then
the radar slews black.

1398
01:06:16.067 --> 01:06:18.267
and they try again.
breaks lock and slews back.

1399
01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:22.433
And then eventually.
it's able to bind

1400
01:06:22.467 --> 01:06:24.700
around the object and you can
hear the Wizzo saying that

1401
01:06:24.733 --> 01:06:27.800
he went to auto...
auto track mode

1402
01:06:27.833 --> 01:06:29.233
to auto slew onto it.

1403
01:06:29.267 --> 01:06:31.400
Right. And I love
asking you this question.

1404
01:06:31.433 --> 01:06:33.133
Have you ever seen
anything like this?

1405
01:06:33.167 --> 01:06:35.433
I have never seen
anything like this.

1406
01:06:35.467 --> 01:06:38.833
I love hearing that. you know.
because you know.
you are the one

1407
01:06:38.867 --> 01:06:41.067
up there that should be
able to identify this stuff.

1408
01:06:41.067 --> 01:06:44.500
And it's so mind bending when
we hear that we don't
know what this is.

1409
01:06:44.533 --> 01:06:47.067
George. how important
was this video.

1410
01:06:47.067 --> 01:06:48.900
to the compiling of
the Pentagon report?

1411
01:06:48.933 --> 01:06:50.533
Well. it's another brick
in the wall.

1412
01:06:50.567 --> 01:06:52.400
You'll recall the "Tic Tac"
was the first one

1413
01:06:52.433 --> 01:06:53.567
that was officially released.

1414
01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:55.567
and that the New York times
reported on.

1415
01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:57.167
then Gimbal.
then Go fast.

1416
01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:59.533
And uh. taken altogether.

1417
01:06:59.567 --> 01:07:03.300
it certainly paints a picture
that someone out there
has got some technology

1418
01:07:03.333 --> 01:07:04.900
far beyond what we've got.

1419
01:07:04.933 --> 01:07:06.500
All right. I want to
understand this video

1420
01:07:06.533 --> 01:07:07.433
a little bit more.

1421
01:07:07.467 --> 01:07:09.167
So. let's check in
with Jessica and Dr. O

1422
01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:12.800
to bring us up to speed
on propulsion and movement.
Jess.

1423
01:07:12.833 --> 01:07:15.800
Thanks. Josh. Dr. O.
we're throwing around
a lot of words

1424
01:07:15.833 --> 01:07:16.933
that aren't everyday terms.

1425
01:07:16.967 --> 01:07:19.500
So. let's start with g-force.

1426
01:07:19.533 --> 01:07:23.133
for example. traditional known
vehicles versus the UAPs

1427
01:07:23.167 --> 01:07:25.067
that we've been seeing.
a la the "Tic Tac."

1428
01:07:25.067 --> 01:07:27.300
What is g-force. exactly?

1429
01:07:27.333 --> 01:07:30.333
So. when a body...
If you're in a vehicle.

1430
01:07:30.367 --> 01:07:32.067
-and it changes direction...
-Yeah.

1431
01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:34.067
If it speeds up
or slows down.

1432
01:07:34.067 --> 01:07:36.400
you will feel what is
like a force.

1433
01:07:36.433 --> 01:07:40.133
And that is due to a change in
your state of motion.

1434
01:07:40.167 --> 01:07:41.633
and we call that acceleration.

1435
01:07:41.667 --> 01:07:43.567
So. we look at a race car.

1436
01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:47.133
it has a top speed of
246-miles-per-hour.

1437
01:07:47.167 --> 01:07:49.067
But if the car is going at
a constant speed.

1438
01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:50.500
it's not accelerating.

1439
01:07:50.533 --> 01:07:53.267
So. it doesn't matter
how fast you're going.
you don't feel forces.

1440
01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:54.600
But if it accelerates.

1441
01:07:54.633 --> 01:07:58.100
-and this accelerates 6gs.
you feel the force.
-I see.

1442
01:07:58.133 --> 01:08:01.433
So. a g is
a gravity equivalent.

1443
01:08:01.467 --> 01:08:05.233
So a person in this vehicle
will feel six times
their own weight

1444
01:08:05.267 --> 01:08:06.533
pressing on them.

1445
01:08:06.567 --> 01:08:08.600
If you're in a F-117.

1446
01:08:08.633 --> 01:08:12.067
it's top speed is
684 miles per hour.

1447
01:08:12.067 --> 01:08:15.367
But it's top acceleration
is 9gs.

1448
01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:19.200
that means the pilot
will feel nine times
their own body weight.

1449
01:08:19.233 --> 01:08:21.833
And you can only
survive that a short time.

1450
01:08:21.867 --> 01:08:25.267
Really? So. zero to nine.
that's what's gonna hit you.

1451
01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:26.533
-That's what
you're gonna feel.
-Oh. yeah.

1452
01:08:26.567 --> 01:08:28.067
When you're in a car
that goes really fast

1453
01:08:28.067 --> 01:08:29.167
you get pushed back
in your seat...

1454
01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:30.533
-Yeah.
-That's a g-force.

1455
01:08:30.567 --> 01:08:33.233
That's an acceleration
creating a force
on your body.

1456
01:08:33.267 --> 01:08:35.633
Now we talk about an F-16.

1457
01:08:35.667 --> 01:08:37.067
-Mmm-hmm
-Look at that top speed.

1458
01:08:37.067 --> 01:08:39.067
1.500-miles-per-hour.

1459
01:08:39.067 --> 01:08:43.233
Much faster than the F-17
but the same
maximum acceleration.

1460
01:08:43.267 --> 01:08:44.067
-Okay.
-Right?

1461
01:08:44.067 --> 01:08:45.467
So inside your body...

1462
01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:48.933
your body is designed to
be upright in gravity.

1463
01:08:48.967 --> 01:08:51.433
So. that determines
where blood goes.

1464
01:08:51.467 --> 01:08:53.067
And so.
if you accelerate too fast

1465
01:08:53.067 --> 01:08:54.533
it's going to go
where it's not supposed to.

1466
01:08:54.567 --> 01:08:56.833
So. then. how many gs
can the human body

1467
01:08:56.867 --> 01:09:00.267
withstand before it can't
withstand it anymore?

1468
01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:03.300
It depends.
It's a matter of the g-force

1469
01:09:03.333 --> 01:09:06.467
and the amount of time you
experience that g-force.

1470
01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:07.400
Mmm-hmm.

1471
01:09:07.433 --> 01:09:08.967
So... And it also depends
on your training.

1472
01:09:09.067 --> 01:09:10.833
So. a fighter pilot.
for example.

1473
01:09:10.867 --> 01:09:13.400
may hit 9 gs over the course
of their career

1474
01:09:13.433 --> 01:09:14.733
over and over
and over again.

1475
01:09:14.767 --> 01:09:16.967
But. you know. regular people
like you and me.

1476
01:09:17.067 --> 01:09:18.767
who are untrained...

1477
01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:21.100
Well. I could survive it
but the average
person couldn't.

1478
01:09:21.133 --> 01:09:23.633
Well. I almost passed out
on The Mummy ride at...

1479
01:09:23.667 --> 01:09:25.633
-You know. it's fine.
I wouldn't make it.
-Might've been fear.

1480
01:09:25.667 --> 01:09:27.533
It... it was
definitely that too.

1481
01:09:27.567 --> 01:09:29.400
So how does this all compare
with the Tic Tac?

1482
01:09:29.433 --> 01:09:30.967
Now. what we have...

1483
01:09:31.067 --> 01:09:33.500
If we take these videos
at face value.

1484
01:09:33.533 --> 01:09:35.667
and say
this is a vehicle.

1485
01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:38.067
that's changing speed
this rapidly.

1486
01:09:38.067 --> 01:09:39.300
that gives us data.

1487
01:09:39.333 --> 01:09:40.667
'Cause look at those g-forces.

1488
01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:42.433
-Yeah.
-Five thousand.

1489
01:09:42.467 --> 01:09:44.267
No living creature.
that we know

1490
01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:47.433
that's macroscopic like
ourselves could survive that.

1491
01:09:47.467 --> 01:09:50.433
So. that would say that
if we take it at face value.

1492
01:09:50.467 --> 01:09:52.400
is there a being inside there.

1493
01:09:52.433 --> 01:09:54.467
and if there is.
what is the trick that

1494
01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:55.567
-allows them to survive.
-Yeah.

1495
01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:57.767
Or maybe it's their drone.
or maybe it's a droid.

1496
01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:59.533
-a robot. who know.
-Exactly.

1497
01:09:59.567 --> 01:10:01.667
-Interesting. Excellent.
-Thank you.

1498
01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:03.733
-So much fun to talk
with you Dr. O.
-Yes.

1499
01:10:03.767 --> 01:10:04.967
Josh.

1500
01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.900
Well. thanks very much.
Jessica and Dr. O.

1501
01:10:06.933 --> 01:10:11.167
let's see what our followers
on Twitter have to say
at this point.

1502
01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:12.767
Uh. HOOV says.

1503
01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:15.433
the public deserves to
know the truth.

1504
01:10:15.467 --> 01:10:17.100
UFOsDeclassifiedLIVE.

1505
01:10:17.133 --> 01:10:18.767
I agree. That's what
we're doing here.

1506
01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:20.333
Talking about this report.

1507
01:10:20.367 --> 01:10:23.300
And important to know there is
actually a classified version
of this report

1508
01:10:23.333 --> 01:10:25.833
and I agree with you.
The public does deserve
to know what's in it.

1509
01:10:25.867 --> 01:10:27.800
Uh. Jenner2112 writes.

1510
01:10:27.833 --> 01:10:31.667
"The fact that so many UFOs
are witnessed around military.

1511
01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:34.433
maybe they're trying to
get them to stop
doing something."

1512
01:10:34.467 --> 01:10:35.867
Interesting idea.

1513
01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:37.567
That maybe they're
not here to hurt us.

1514
01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:39.267
they're here to protect us.

1515
01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:41.733
Kind of
a Day The Earth Stood Still
point of view.

1516
01:10:41.767 --> 01:10:43.400
And then Random Bits says.

1517
01:10:43.433 --> 01:10:45.833
"UFOsdeclassifiedlive.
Josh is wearing a suit?

1518
01:10:45.867 --> 01:10:47.233
Is he the alien?"

1519
01:10:47.267 --> 01:10:49.533
-That's. that's right.
You found me out. It's me.
-[crew laugh]

1520
01:10:49.567 --> 01:10:51.667
Listen. I wish I could wear
this suit all the time.

1521
01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:54.067
uh. but you try crawling
through an Egyptian tomb
wearing this.

1522
01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:55.567
It's not pretty.

1523
01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:58.333
Uh. anyway. be sure to
rocket your tweets our way

1524
01:10:58.367 --> 01:11:02.367
using the hashtag
ufosdeclassifiedlive.

1525
01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:06.200
Coming up we have got more
authenticated UAP video

1526
01:11:06.233 --> 01:11:07.767
and I will be speaking.
this is a big one.

1527
01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:10.267
with the head of NASA.
Bill Nelson.

1528
01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:12.167
Then we'll look at
the discovery

1529
01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:13.867
that may answer the question.

1530
01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:16.500
is there life outside
our solar system?

1531
01:11:16.533 --> 01:11:19.233
When UFOs Declassified:
Live continues.

1532
01:11:35.667 --> 01:11:39.667
Welcome back to
UFOs Declassified: Live.

1533
01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:42.400
I'm Josh Gates. I just
found out we are
the number three

1534
01:11:42.433 --> 01:11:44.533
trending topic on Twitter.

1535
01:11:44.567 --> 01:11:46.133
Please keep those
tweets coming.

1536
01:11:46.167 --> 01:11:48.567
If we get to number one.
they're gonna let me
keep the suit.

1537
01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:51.700
Uh. before the break we're
discussing the mind altering

1538
01:11:51.733 --> 01:11:54.500
go fast UFO footage
taken aboard

1539
01:11:54.533 --> 01:11:58.067
a navy jet fighter from
the USS Theodore Roosevelt

1540
01:11:58.067 --> 01:12:00.300
off the Florida coast in 2015.

1541
01:12:00.333 --> 01:12:03.633
Now. this next UAP
was caught on camera

1542
01:12:03.667 --> 01:12:06.567
in the same year from
near the same location.

1543
01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:08.467
Check out the motion
of this craft.

1544
01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:10.600
This is the Gimbal UFO.

1545
01:12:12.667 --> 01:12:14.900
[pilot 1] It is
a [bleep] drone. bro.

1546
01:12:16.333 --> 01:12:18.367
[pilot 2]
There's a whole fleet of them.
Look on the ASA.

1547
01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:21.067
[pilot 1] My gosh!

1548
01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:24.067
They're all going
against the wind.

1549
01:12:24.067 --> 01:12:26.067
The wind's 120 knots
out of the west.

1550
01:12:26.067 --> 01:12:27.633
Look at that thing. dude.

1551
01:12:36.567 --> 01:12:38.067
That's not an [inaudible]
though. is it?

1552
01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:40.167
[pilot 2]
That's not one of ours.
is it?

1553
01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:42.300
[pilot 1] Well. if there's a--
[pilot 2] Look at that thing!

1554
01:12:42.333 --> 01:12:44.067
It's rotating.

1555
01:12:45.767 --> 01:12:49.067
Well. joining Jeremy. George
and Bob on the panel is

1556
01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:52.400
-our resident astrophysicist.
Dr. O. Good to see you.
-Thank you. sir.

1557
01:12:52.433 --> 01:12:54.200
-Bringing some science
to the desk.
-That's right.

1558
01:12:54.233 --> 01:12:55.633
Okay. let's talk about this.

1559
01:12:55.667 --> 01:12:58.633
What's your first thought
upon seeing this Gimbal video?

1560
01:12:58.667 --> 01:13:00.600
Well. I'm trained
as a physicist.

1561
01:13:00.633 --> 01:13:03.967
So when I see any data.
my first thought is.
"I don't believe it."

1562
01:13:04.067 --> 01:13:06.200
-[Josh laughs] Skeptical.
-Right. I don't take it
at face value.

1563
01:13:06.233 --> 01:13:08.333
We have to take the data

1564
01:13:08.367 --> 01:13:10.900
and validate it
and then make scientific

1565
01:13:10.933 --> 01:13:12.900
measurements that are
actually rigorous.

1566
01:13:12.933 --> 01:13:15.967
So I don't have this data
in my possession

1567
01:13:16.067 --> 01:13:17.867
and so I can't really say
anything about it

1568
01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:19.900
'cause I haven't taken it
through that process.

1569
01:13:19.933 --> 01:13:21.300
Do you think we can explain

1570
01:13:21.333 --> 01:13:24.567
just looking at it. how this
craft moves and rotates?

1571
01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:27.600
You know. it's difficult
to do to disentangle

1572
01:13:27.633 --> 01:13:29.767
because you have many
moving things at one time.

1573
01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:31.267
You have the moving object.

1574
01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:34.867
You have the moving plane
or whatever platform is
taking the data.

1575
01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:36.533
And quite often
if you're locking on

1576
01:13:36.567 --> 01:13:39.067
that means that you have
something else moving separate

1577
01:13:39.067 --> 01:13:42.067
from the actual vehicle
that it's mounted on.

1578
01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:45.300
So. you have to
disentangle all this stuff
and it's complicated.

1579
01:13:45.333 --> 01:13:47.267
But if you take it
at face value

1580
01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:48.700
as I said before.

1581
01:13:48.733 --> 01:13:50.700
you see some
interesting aerodynamics.

1582
01:13:50.733 --> 01:13:53.533
Absolutely. Now. Jeremy.
on the clip we hear
a voice say.

1583
01:13:53.567 --> 01:13:55.700
"There's a whole fleet
of them."

1584
01:13:55.733 --> 01:13:58.067
Now is that just
eyewitness saying that?

1585
01:13:58.067 --> 01:13:59.633
Do we have data
to back that up?

1586
01:13:59.667 --> 01:14:02.400
Yeah. absolutely. But a lot
of it is gonna be classified
and not gonna come up.

1587
01:14:02.433 --> 01:14:04.533
But I can tell you
with 100% certainty.

1588
01:14:04.567 --> 01:14:05.933
and some people have
been exposed to it.

1589
01:14:05.967 --> 01:14:07.400
There was a fleet
in front of this.

1590
01:14:07.433 --> 01:14:09.467
And. by the way. this object--
Listen to the pilots.

1591
01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:11.233
They have got some of
our best sensors.

1592
01:14:11.267 --> 01:14:12.800
It's moving against the wind.

1593
01:14:12.833 --> 01:14:14.800
It's rotating. You can
hear what they say.

1594
01:14:14.833 --> 01:14:16.300
But there were
other objects that

1595
01:14:16.333 --> 01:14:18.833
were with the Gimbal
and the Gimbal has
unique propulsion

1596
01:14:18.867 --> 01:14:20.467
as it goes forward. changes

1597
01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:22.433
and starts to reverse
direction in the end.

1598
01:14:22.467 --> 01:14:25.567
Bob. any chance what we're
looking at here could be fake.

1599
01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:26.800
do you think?

1600
01:14:26.833 --> 01:14:29.500
Absolutely. there's a chance.
I think it's a small chance.

1601
01:14:29.533 --> 01:14:33.700
Now. this comes from credible
sources. credible sensors.

1602
01:14:33.733 --> 01:14:37.200
So. the video itself. I think.

1603
01:14:37.233 --> 01:14:39.067
authentic. absolutely.

1604
01:14:39.067 --> 01:14:42.667
Now what it means
is a different question.

1605
01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:44.067
I'd like to say

1606
01:14:44.067 --> 01:14:47.300
I've seen the rabbit come out
of the hat many times.

1607
01:14:47.333 --> 01:14:49.367
And is the rabbit in the hat?

1608
01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:52.300
It depends where you're
sitting in the audience

1609
01:14:52.333 --> 01:14:54.500
to know whether the rabbit's
in the hat or not.

1610
01:14:54.533 --> 01:14:57.433
George. how important was
this Gimbal footage

1611
01:14:57.467 --> 01:15:00.167
-to the Pentagon report?
-Oh. it was hugely important.

1612
01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:02.267
I mean. you know.
like Dr. O said

1613
01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:03.800
we don't have
a lot of the data.

1614
01:15:03.833 --> 01:15:05.700
We don't have the object
itself to examine.

1615
01:15:05.733 --> 01:15:08.200
There is signals data
and sensor data that

1616
01:15:08.233 --> 01:15:11.067
as Jeremey said we're probably
never gonna get to see.

1617
01:15:11.067 --> 01:15:13.367
But what we don't
see in that is wings

1618
01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:15.733
or rotors or any kind of
known propulsion system.

1619
01:15:15.767 --> 01:15:18.833
We don't see any chemical
kind of a trail coming out
of the back of it.

1620
01:15:18.867 --> 01:15:21.067
How does that thing stay up?
How does it fly?

1621
01:15:21.067 --> 01:15:23.200
All right.
Also I think. for me.

1622
01:15:23.233 --> 01:15:26.833
just the enthusiasm that you
hear in the pilots' voices.

1623
01:15:26.867 --> 01:15:29.333
I mean. they are just agog
looking at this thing.

1624
01:15:29.367 --> 01:15:31.200
To me that is really
compelling here as well.

1625
01:15:31.233 --> 01:15:33.667
You've just got-- You know.
these guys are freaking out.

1626
01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:35.533
This is something they
had not seen before.

1627
01:15:35.567 --> 01:15:39.067
They were starting to see
UFOs on a daily basis
on the east coast.

1628
01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:41.767
Cubes. Cubes with spheres
around them.

1629
01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:44.067
Things are completely
non-aerodynamic.

1630
01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:47.200
This is one representation of
many sightings and encounters.

1631
01:15:47.233 --> 01:15:49.900
All right. So speaking of
pilots like we hear in
this video.

1632
01:15:49.933 --> 01:15:52.900
let's check in with Jessica
and our resident fighter pilot

1633
01:15:52.933 --> 01:15:57.067
Tracy LaTourrette for
a closer look at
the Gimbal UFO. Jessica?

1634
01:15:57.067 --> 01:15:59.567
Thank you. Josh.
Tracy. on the Gimbal footage

1635
01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:02.567
there is so much going on with
the numbers and the initials

1636
01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:05.433
that it's hard to know
what to actually focus on.

1637
01:16:05.467 --> 01:16:08.633
So. what are the most
important elements
of this video?

1638
01:16:08.667 --> 01:16:10.767
Well. there's...
We could talk all day on

1639
01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:12.167
-what we're looking at here.
-Mmm-hmm.

1640
01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:15.967
But if you look at
the image itself.

1641
01:16:16.067 --> 01:16:18.600
the fact that we're able to
actually lock onto something

1642
01:16:18.633 --> 01:16:21.900
tells me that it's not just
a light phenomenon
or something.

1643
01:16:21.933 --> 01:16:24.533
So. obviously there is
something very
interesting there

1644
01:16:24.567 --> 01:16:27.533
and obviously it's hot because
we're in black hot mode.

1645
01:16:27.567 --> 01:16:30.733
Uh. if you look at
the aspect of the object

1646
01:16:30.767 --> 01:16:35.600
it could suggest a tail
aspect of an aircraft.

1647
01:16:35.633 --> 01:16:38.967
Although. you know.
that's debatable as well

1648
01:16:39.067 --> 01:16:41.967
because it might be shaped
a little bit differently
looking at the back.

1649
01:16:42.067 --> 01:16:44.067
Okay. so as if it was
traveling away from us.

1650
01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:45.767
-Mmm-hmm.
-Understood.

1651
01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:48.733
Right. and then. finally.
you hear them talking
about the fact that

1652
01:16:48.767 --> 01:16:51.100
-it appears to
actually rotate.
-Mmm-hmm.

1653
01:16:51.133 --> 01:16:53.300
That suggests
not only awareness

1654
01:16:53.333 --> 01:16:56.667
but gives some indication
of potential intent

1655
01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:59.067
because it looks like
it's just observing

1656
01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:02.733
and luckily not showing us
any kind of hostile intent.

1657
01:17:02.767 --> 01:17:05.433
-So. that's a good thing.
-That's scary.

1658
01:17:05.467 --> 01:17:07.467
Well. you always have to
think about that.

1659
01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:09.800
-Is this thing
trying to kill me?
-Yeah. Well. yeah.

1660
01:17:09.833 --> 01:17:11.667
-[Tracy chuckles]
-Yeah. Okay.

1661
01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:13.700
Uh. awesome. [laughs]

1662
01:17:13.733 --> 01:17:15.233
That was a good talk.
Awesome. Tracy.

1663
01:17:15.267 --> 01:17:17.067
Back to you. Josh.

1664
01:17:17.067 --> 01:17:18.733
All right. well. thank you.
Jessica and Tracy.

1665
01:17:18.767 --> 01:17:21.467
When we come back.
I'll be speaking with
former astronaut.

1666
01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:24.533
senators and NASA
administrator. Bill Nelson.

1667
01:17:24.567 --> 01:17:27.267
We'll also learn
what 'Oumuamua means.

1668
01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:28.700
I'm glad I can pronounce it.

1669
01:17:28.733 --> 01:17:31.067
And later. we've got
rare UAP footage

1670
01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:33.267
from the deck of the USS Omaha

1671
01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:35.933
that may help our panel of
experts reach their verdict.

1672
01:17:35.967 --> 01:17:38.267
Adversary. alien or neither?

1673
01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:40.500
During the break be sure to
hit us up on Twitter

1674
01:17:40.533 --> 01:17:44.267
using the hashtag
ufosdeclassifiedlive.

1675
01:18:00.533 --> 01:18:03.967
We are continuing to pour
over the Pentagon report

1676
01:18:04.067 --> 01:18:06.200
on unidentified
aerial phenomena.

1677
01:18:06.233 --> 01:18:09.867
As the report indicates.
there is not one
blanket explanation

1678
01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:11.133
for all of them.

1679
01:18:11.167 --> 01:18:14.467
And that's why you
are watching
UFOs Declassified: Live.

1680
01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:15.600
I'm Josh Gates.

1681
01:18:15.633 --> 01:18:17.700
At this time we are
honored to be joined by

1682
01:18:17.733 --> 01:18:19.167
the current head of NASA.

1683
01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:22.933
He has flown in space
and previously served
Florida in the senate.

1684
01:18:22.967 --> 01:18:24.767
Bill Nelson.
Good to see you. sir.

1685
01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:27.067
Hey.

1686
01:18:27.067 --> 01:18:28.733
It's great to see you

1687
01:18:28.767 --> 01:18:32.233
and I'm always ready to talk
about space.

1688
01:18:32.267 --> 01:18:33.700
Well. that's good. I'm glad.

1689
01:18:33.733 --> 01:18:36.233
We have a lot to talk about
with the release of
this report.

1690
01:18:36.267 --> 01:18:38.467
Uh. obviously you've read it.

1691
01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:41.267
What do you think is the most
eye-opening aspect of this?

1692
01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:46.767
Well. I was briefed on this
a couple years ago
in the senate

1693
01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:48.633
-armed services committee.
-Mmm-hmm.

1694
01:18:48.667 --> 01:18:53.100
And I had a chance to talk
to the navy pilots.

1695
01:18:53.133 --> 01:18:58.067
You've seen the video now
a number of times on TV.

1696
01:18:58.067 --> 01:19:01.333
They know that
they saw something.

1697
01:19:01.367 --> 01:19:04.700
They tracked it.
They chased it.

1698
01:19:04.733 --> 01:19:08.100
And then all of a sudden it
would move from one location

1699
01:19:08.133 --> 01:19:11.767
to another in a split second.

1700
01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:16.900
Uh. now we know from
the unclassified report

1701
01:19:16.933 --> 01:19:21.200
that there have been over
140 of these sightings

1702
01:19:21.233 --> 01:19:23.567
around the globe.

1703
01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:27.267
And so from
the pilot's standpoint

1704
01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:30.267
they know they saw
something real.

1705
01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:33.533
-Right.
-Now we need to
find out what It is.

1706
01:19:33.567 --> 01:19:36.167
So. that's why I've asked
the NASA scientists.

1707
01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:40.067
look at it from
a scientific point of view

1708
01:19:40.067 --> 01:19:42.633
and let's see if you
come up with any answers.

1709
01:19:42.667 --> 01:19:44.133
And I think
that's a good point.

1710
01:19:44.167 --> 01:19:47.067
There's an enormous amount of
credibility here in terms of

1711
01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:49.633
these pilots. In terms of
the people that witnessed

1712
01:19:49.667 --> 01:19:51.600
whatever these objects were.

1713
01:19:51.633 --> 01:19:53.967
If you take the report
at face value.

1714
01:19:54.067 --> 01:19:56.333
what do you think it says
about national security?

1715
01:19:58.233 --> 01:20:00.500
Well. we don't know.

1716
01:20:00.533 --> 01:20:03.700
Uh. we don't know
if it's something

1717
01:20:03.733 --> 01:20:07.433
out of this world
or if it is. uh.

1718
01:20:07.467 --> 01:20:10.033
a person that could--
An entity

1719
01:20:10.067 --> 01:20:12.833
that could be a potential
adversary here on Earth.

1720
01:20:12.867 --> 01:20:15.800
-Right.
-Now. our government is saying

1721
01:20:15.833 --> 01:20:19.967
this is not any technology
that we are testing.

1722
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.300
uh. therefore we ought
to be concerned.

1723
01:20:23.333 --> 01:20:26.067
That's why we need to get
to the bottom of this.

1724
01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:30.000
Right. Now a lot of people are
speculating that these UAPs

1725
01:20:30.033 --> 01:20:31.533
could be extraterrestrial.

1726
01:20:31.567 --> 01:20:33.433
You yourself have
flown into space.

1727
01:20:33.467 --> 01:20:36.200
You were a payload specialist
during the shuttle program.

1728
01:20:36.233 --> 01:20:40.233
Do you personally believe that
there is extraterrestrial life
out there?

1729
01:20:41.667 --> 01:20:43.467
Well. let's separate
the question.

1730
01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:47.700
Do I believe that
these objects are ETs?

1731
01:20:47.733 --> 01:20:50.600
Uh. the answer is
I don't know.

1732
01:20:50.633 --> 01:20:53.567
-That's why we're
asking the questions.
-Right.

1733
01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:57.133
Your second question is

1734
01:20:57.167 --> 01:21:00.067
do I think that there's life
out there in the universe?

1735
01:21:00.067 --> 01:21:03.600
This is a universe that is

1736
01:21:03.633 --> 01:21:08.133
13.5 billion years old.

1737
01:21:09.267 --> 01:21:13.800
Uh. it is so vast
we cannot even imagine...

1738
01:21:13.833 --> 01:21:17.500
Our minds cannot
grasp the size of it.

1739
01:21:17.533 --> 01:21:19.667
Do I think that there's

1740
01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:23.567
another solar system
in another galaxy

1741
01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:26.133
with another sun with planets

1742
01:21:26.167 --> 01:21:28.133
revolving around it

1743
01:21:28.167 --> 01:21:32.067
that might have a planet
with a habitable atmosphere?

1744
01:21:32.067 --> 01:21:33.500
Of course. I do.

1745
01:21:33.533 --> 01:21:36.733
Do you think that
this particular report.

1746
01:21:36.767 --> 01:21:38.333
which was generated
by the Pentagon.

1747
01:21:38.367 --> 01:21:40.567
do you think that it should
be shifted to NASA?

1748
01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:43.167
Should NASA have
a permanent responsibility to.

1749
01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:46.067
you think. look into these
sightings and to continue

1750
01:21:46.067 --> 01:21:47.433
pursuing this question?

1751
01:21:48.733 --> 01:21:52.800
No. The Pentagon needs to
continue its defense function.

1752
01:21:52.833 --> 01:21:56.800
NASA needs to continue
its scientific function.

1753
01:21:56.833 --> 01:21:58.867
And that's exactly
what we're doing.

1754
01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:02.067
Terrific. Well. I can't wait
to see what the Webb Telescope

1755
01:22:02.067 --> 01:22:04.100
and what NASA
has in store next.

1756
01:22:04.133 --> 01:22:06.067
Thank you so much for
your time with us today.

1757
01:22:06.067 --> 01:22:07.267
I really appreciate it. sir.

1758
01:22:08.233 --> 01:22:11.133
-Have a great day.
-All the best.

1759
01:22:11.167 --> 01:22:15.367
Well. so far tonight we have
focused on unidentified
aerial phenomena.

1760
01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:18.467
Right now. though.
we're going to shift
our gaze to an identified

1761
01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:21.767
interstellar object that may
be an indicator of life

1762
01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:23.400
in other solar systems.

1763
01:22:23.433 --> 01:22:25.400
This startling discovery
was spotted

1764
01:22:25.433 --> 01:22:28.067
by Canadian astronomer
Robert Weryk

1765
01:22:28.067 --> 01:22:30.733
from the Haleakala Observatory
on Maui.

1766
01:22:30.767 --> 01:22:33.267
And since the object
is the first of its type.

1767
01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:36.467
it was named after
the Hawaiian word for scout.

1768
01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:38.567
This is 'Oumuamua.

1769
01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:51.433
Some of us have actually
been predicting that
interstellar objects

1770
01:22:51.467 --> 01:22:53.200
would come into
our solar system.

1771
01:22:53.233 --> 01:22:56.100
We've kind of been waiting to
see something like this.

1772
01:22:56.133 --> 01:22:58.100
[Robert Weryk]
The year was 2017.

1773
01:22:58.133 --> 01:23:01.067
I was reviewing detections
from the Pan-STARRS1 telescope

1774
01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:03.133
and I found what's now
known as 'Oumuamua.

1775
01:23:03.167 --> 01:23:04.700
This comet is very different

1776
01:23:04.733 --> 01:23:07.067
than all the comets that
we see on our solar system.

1777
01:23:07.067 --> 01:23:10.467
[Sarah Barker]
We really expected if we were
to see an interstellar object

1778
01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:12.367
that it would look
like a comet.

1779
01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:15.767
'Oumuamua is at least five.
maybe even ten times

1780
01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:18.067
longer than it is wide.

1781
01:23:18.067 --> 01:23:21.400
After 'Oumuamua was
no longer visible from
ground based telescopes.

1782
01:23:21.433 --> 01:23:24.333
we got very accurate
positional information
from Hubble.

1783
01:23:24.367 --> 01:23:28.933
And that allowed us
to discover this
non-gravitational deviation.

1784
01:23:28.967 --> 01:23:31.933
'Oumuamua came in
at this crazy angle

1785
01:23:31.967 --> 01:23:35.233
and it was moving so fast.

1786
01:23:35.267 --> 01:23:37.867
Fifty-five miles per second.

1787
01:23:40.267 --> 01:23:42.800
[Robert] 'Oumuamua is some
kind of comet or asteroid.

1788
01:23:42.833 --> 01:23:45.833
No one can tell for sure
what 'Oumuamua was.

1789
01:23:45.867 --> 01:23:48.633
[Nick Pope]
This could be a probe.

1790
01:23:48.667 --> 01:23:53.400
A civilization with millions
and millions of years
head start on us

1791
01:23:53.433 --> 01:23:57.500
could have built hundreds
of these probes

1792
01:23:57.533 --> 01:24:00.533
and just let them loose
throughout the galaxy.

1793
01:24:00.567 --> 01:24:03.600
And every now and then
one would drift through
a solar system.

1794
01:24:03.633 --> 01:24:09.267
And if they spotted an active
transmitting civilization.

1795
01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:14.567
then the ship activates.
Something wakes up.

1796
01:24:15.667 --> 01:24:18.100
Maybe a message is beamed back

1797
01:24:18.133 --> 01:24:20.533
to the aliens' home world.

1798
01:24:20.567 --> 01:24:24.833
It says we've discovered
another emerging civilization.

1799
01:24:24.867 --> 01:24:27.367
Once that message is received.

1800
01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:29.633
then they're going to
come in force.

1801
01:24:29.667 --> 01:24:32.200
Hopefully in peace.
but maybe not.

1802
01:24:33.567 --> 01:24:37.067
[Sarah] There are plans to
launch a mission into space.

1803
01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:40.467
have it just in a stable
orbit just waiting

1804
01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:42.867
for the next
interstellar object.

1805
01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:46.067
And once they spot it. they'll
just be ready to get there.

1806
01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:50.067
[Nick] 'Oumuamua.
it's a little disconcerting

1807
01:24:50.067 --> 01:24:53.400
that it got as close
as it did without anyone
seeing it coming.

1808
01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:58.967
What if we were facing
hostile extraterrestrials?

1809
01:24:59.067 --> 01:25:01.667
Or what if this
had just been a rock

1810
01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:05.067
but headed directly
for planet Earth?

1811
01:25:05.067 --> 01:25:07.533
I mean. 'Oumuamua should be
a wakeup call.

1812
01:25:07.567 --> 01:25:09.667
We missed the last one.

1813
01:25:10.533 --> 01:25:12.067
Let's not miss the next one.

1814
01:25:14.467 --> 01:25:16.867
All right. guys.
I'm here With Dr. O.

1815
01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:21.067
So. Dr. O. in your opinion
why is 'Oumuamua such
an important discovery?

1816
01:25:21.067 --> 01:25:23.900
Well. there are certain things
that we figure out in science

1817
01:25:23.933 --> 01:25:27.100
but we can't accept as true
until we actually observe it.

1818
01:25:27.133 --> 01:25:30.067
For example. we figured out
early in the 20th century

1819
01:25:30.067 --> 01:25:32.967
that planet formation
is a side effect of
star formation.

1820
01:25:33.067 --> 01:25:34.433
But it wasn't until the '90s

1821
01:25:34.467 --> 01:25:37.233
that we first saw a planet
outside of our solar system.

1822
01:25:37.267 --> 01:25:39.967
Such that we can say.
"Yes. there they are."

1823
01:25:40.067 --> 01:25:42.067
So. we have a good
understanding now

1824
01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:43.733
of how a solar system
is formed.

1825
01:25:43.767 --> 01:25:47.333
And what happens is it's
a very chaotic situation.

1826
01:25:47.367 --> 01:25:50.133
So where we have four
terrestrial planets today.

1827
01:25:50.167 --> 01:25:51.967
there were dozens
of proto planets.

1828
01:25:52.067 --> 01:25:54.067
And as they interacted
and collided.

1829
01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:55.967
some objects were
thrown into the Sun.

1830
01:25:56.067 --> 01:25:58.467
some objects were incorporated
in the planetary bodies

1831
01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:00.933
And some were sent flying
out of our solar system.

1832
01:26:00.967 --> 01:26:02.367
How... How?

1833
01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:03.600
Like. how do they get--

1834
01:26:03.633 --> 01:26:05.500
How are they circling around

1835
01:26:05.533 --> 01:26:07.967
and all of a sudden one
decides to just take off?

1836
01:26:08.067 --> 01:26:11.167
Yeah. so it has to do with
gravitational interaction.

1837
01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:13.733
So. close calls will
change a trajectory.

1838
01:26:13.767 --> 01:26:16.667
And if it swings around
the Sun or. say. Jupiter.
right?

1839
01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:19.933
And under the right
circumstances it can gain
enough momentum

1840
01:26:19.967 --> 01:26:22.467
to just slingshot right out
of the solar system.

1841
01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:25.600
So. we expect that objects
from our solar system

1842
01:26:25.633 --> 01:26:27.367
are flying throughout
the galaxy

1843
01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:30.900
and objects from other
solar systems are also
flying throughout the galaxy

1844
01:26:30.933 --> 01:26:33.833
and on occasion they may
enter our solar system.

1845
01:26:33.867 --> 01:26:36.600
-And that's what
'Oumuamua represents.
-Okay.

1846
01:26:36.633 --> 01:26:39.233
Okay. the 'Oumuamua
was actually discovered

1847
01:26:39.267 --> 01:26:41.333
using the telescope
that's shown behind us.

1848
01:26:41.367 --> 01:26:42.500
That's right.

1849
01:26:42.533 --> 01:26:45.767
So. we found 'Oumuamua with
the telescope on Haleakala

1850
01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:47.600
-in the Hawaiian island.
-Very well done.

1851
01:26:47.633 --> 01:26:50.100
-Yes. Yes. I've been there.
It's a cool spot.
-Yeah.

1852
01:26:50.133 --> 01:26:52.933
Yeah. and so. the thing
about an object like this

1853
01:26:52.967 --> 01:26:54.333
is similar to an asteroid.

1854
01:26:54.367 --> 01:26:58.300
So when we look at
interstellar or
interplanetary interlopers.

1855
01:26:58.333 --> 01:26:59.867
-they come in two main types.
-Mmm-hmm.

1856
01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:03.167
Stuff that was once a part
of a planetary body.

1857
01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:06.600
so it will be made up of
metal or stone or rocky.

1858
01:27:06.633 --> 01:27:08.200
And stuff that never was.

1859
01:27:08.233 --> 01:27:12.833
So that's like comets
or what we call carbonaceous
chondrite. um. asteroids.

1860
01:27:12.867 --> 01:27:17.200
And so 'Oumuamua appeared
to be a rocky body.

1861
01:27:17.233 --> 01:27:20.900
Most of the astronomers
thought that perhaps
it would be an icy body

1862
01:27:20.933 --> 01:27:22.433
but there was
no evidence of that.

1863
01:27:22.467 --> 01:27:25.333
But you can... You see it has
a shape here. It's long
and thin.

1864
01:27:25.367 --> 01:27:27.367
-Mmm-hmm.
-So what we do.
we observe these things.

1865
01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:29.767
Now remember.
the way physics works.

1866
01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:33.433
if this object comes into
our solar system from
a long distance.

1867
01:27:33.467 --> 01:27:36.933
it's like it fell toward
the Sun from
an interstellar distance.

1868
01:27:36.967 --> 01:27:38.900
-Yeah.
-So it's moving so fast

1869
01:27:38.933 --> 01:27:41.167
that you can only get
so much data.

1870
01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:44.667
And one of the important
pieces of data we call
a light curve.

1871
01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:46.700
Let's just look at
its brightness over time.

1872
01:27:46.733 --> 01:27:49.367
So if you imagine
a bowling ball. a bowling pin

1873
01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:51.700
flying through space
and tumbling. right?

1874
01:27:51.733 --> 01:27:54.533
When you're seeing
the long side.
it looks bright.

1875
01:27:54.567 --> 01:27:56.633
When you're seeing
the short end. it looks dim.

1876
01:27:56.667 --> 01:27:59.767
So. you can reconstruct
the shape of objects

1877
01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:02.067
based on how
they reflect light.

1878
01:28:02.067 --> 01:28:04.933
And also. based on
the colors that they reflect.

1879
01:28:04.967 --> 01:28:07.633
you can figure out what it's
made of to some degree.

1880
01:28:08.467 --> 01:28:10.500
You're so smart. oh. my gosh.

1881
01:28:10.533 --> 01:28:11.867
-Okay. Um...
-[laughs]

1882
01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:13.900
What other discoveries

1883
01:28:13.933 --> 01:28:16.567
point to the possibility
of life on other planets?

1884
01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:19.233
Well. so. here is the big

1885
01:28:19.267 --> 01:28:22.133
-controversial analysis
that was done.
-Uh-huh.

1886
01:28:22.167 --> 01:28:24.933
So. as different astronomers
try to figure out

1887
01:28:24.967 --> 01:28:26.433
what is this made of.

1888
01:28:26.467 --> 01:28:28.233
an astronomer from Harvard.

1889
01:28:28.267 --> 01:28:31.100
uh. and his collaborators
performed a study

1890
01:28:31.133 --> 01:28:34.767
where they claimed that
it was way thinner

1891
01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:38.800
than what most of us
read from the data.

1892
01:28:38.833 --> 01:28:42.433
And so. the conclusion was.
"Oh. it looks something
like a sail."

1893
01:28:42.467 --> 01:28:44.933
Now. what would that be?

1894
01:28:44.967 --> 01:28:47.533
And so. this astronomer
just speculated

1895
01:28:47.567 --> 01:28:52.500
that perhaps it is
a light sail from some
alien civilization.

1896
01:28:52.533 --> 01:28:55.400
Now. most astronomers do not
accept that interpretation.

1897
01:28:55.433 --> 01:28:57.333
I mean. that is a--
That is a...

1898
01:28:57.367 --> 01:28:59.500
-That is a leap.
-That is a leap.

1899
01:28:59.533 --> 01:29:01.967
-That is a leap. Okay.
-It is a giant leap. yes. yes.

1900
01:29:02.067 --> 01:29:04.833
But continuing with
what your comment was.

1901
01:29:04.867 --> 01:29:07.067
so most don't accept
necessarily that.

1902
01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:09.833
That's right. So. you know.
there are some phrase
that like.

1903
01:29:09.867 --> 01:29:13.133
you know. great claims
require great evidence
or something like that.

1904
01:29:13.167 --> 01:29:14.867
The evidence just isn't there.

1905
01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:17.067
'Oumuamua remains a mystery.

1906
01:29:17.067 --> 01:29:20.400
Interesting. Okay. so what is
about 'Oumuamua's trajectory

1907
01:29:20.433 --> 01:29:22.100
that made people
raise their eyebrows?

1908
01:29:22.133 --> 01:29:24.300
Oh. that is everything.

1909
01:29:24.333 --> 01:29:26.200
So you look. for example.
at the planets.

1910
01:29:26.233 --> 01:29:29.567
there are these nice
elliptical orbits that are
almost circular.

1911
01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:31.667
but 'Oumuamua did
something different.

1912
01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:34.833
It traced out a geometric
figure that we called
a hyperbola.

1913
01:29:34.867 --> 01:29:37.067
And that is like
an unbound orbit.

1914
01:29:37.067 --> 01:29:40.533
And that told us it is not
from our solar system
necessarily.

1915
01:29:40.567 --> 01:29:42.700
Right? But the other thing
that was really interesting

1916
01:29:42.733 --> 01:29:45.300
-is the laws of physics work
really. really well.
-Mmm-hmm.

1917
01:29:45.333 --> 01:29:48.500
So. we can predict
the trajectories. right?

1918
01:29:48.533 --> 01:29:51.467
And so. if it was a rock.
this is the expected
trajectory.

1919
01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:53.233
But it did
something different.

1920
01:29:53.267 --> 01:29:55.767
-Yeah. It shocked you guys.
-Now that's not unusual.

1921
01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:56.900
-Yeah.
-It shocked us. right?

1922
01:29:56.933 --> 01:29:58.867
It's not as weird
as it may sound.

1923
01:29:58.900 --> 01:30:03.467
'Cause two things will change
the motion of an object.

1924
01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:06.733
One is. sunlight actually
applies a pressure

1925
01:30:06.767 --> 01:30:08.400
and air what's called
the solar winds.

1926
01:30:08.433 --> 01:30:09.967
So that could change
the trajectory.

1927
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.933
And also when objects
get near the Sun.

1928
01:30:11.967 --> 01:30:13.467
if they have any ices.

1929
01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:15.833
those ices would do
what we call outgassing.

1930
01:30:15.867 --> 01:30:18.000
And that creates
a force on the body

1931
01:30:18.033 --> 01:30:21.567
and changes its trajectory
from a purely ballistic
trajectory.

1932
01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:24.200
Awesome. All right.
Well. speaking of outgassing.

1933
01:30:24.233 --> 01:30:25.667
back to you. Josh.

1934
01:30:25.700 --> 01:30:27.667
-Oh. unbelievable. Jess.
-[Jessica laughs]

1935
01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:29.467
Jess. I could have you back
in the jungles tomorrow.

1936
01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:30.800
[Jessica] Oh. no! I'm sorry.

1937
01:30:30.833 --> 01:30:32.733
When we come back.
our panel of experts

1938
01:30:32.767 --> 01:30:35.567
rate their top UAP sightings.

1939
01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:38.467
Which footage checks
all of the boxes for them?

1940
01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:41.567
And later. we'll hear from
some Hollywood heavy hitters

1941
01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:44.367
about whether they
believe in extraterrestrials.

1942
01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:47.367
When UFOs Declassified:
Live returns.

1943
01:31:04.067 --> 01:31:07.233
Welcome back to
UFOs Declassified: Live.

1944
01:31:07.267 --> 01:31:09.433
I'm Josh Gates.
and I am thrilled to be joined

1945
01:31:09.467 --> 01:31:11.700
by our panel of experts.
Jeremy Corbell.

1946
01:31:11.733 --> 01:31:13.567
George Knapp and Nick Pope.

1947
01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:15.533
And we are all here
because of this.

1948
01:31:15.567 --> 01:31:17.467
We are discussing
the Pentagon report

1949
01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:19.367
that just dropped
five days ago.

1950
01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:21.800
And one of the really
interesting take aways

1951
01:31:21.833 --> 01:31:24.633
for me in this report are
these different buckets
they use

1952
01:31:24.667 --> 01:31:27.600
to categorize
the UAPs or UFOs.

1953
01:31:27.633 --> 01:31:30.067
So those categories
are airborne clutter.

1954
01:31:30.067 --> 01:31:33.633
natural atmospheric phenomena.
stuff that's just naturally
occurring.

1955
01:31:33.667 --> 01:31:36.333
uh. USG
or U.S. government. uh.

1956
01:31:36.367 --> 01:31:39.333
foreign adversary systems
and other.

1957
01:31:39.367 --> 01:31:42.433
So let's talk about other
or natural occurrences.

1958
01:31:42.467 --> 01:31:45.700
Jeremy. have you ever looked
at a video or seen a UAP

1959
01:31:45.733 --> 01:31:48.500
and then later realized you'd
misidentified something.

1960
01:31:48.533 --> 01:31:50.667
Well. all the time people
misidentify things.

1961
01:31:50.700 --> 01:31:53.800
And the whole point is
something is unidentified
until it's identified.

1962
01:31:53.833 --> 01:31:55.533
Don't jump to conclusions.

1963
01:31:55.567 --> 01:31:59.067
Right. George. where do you
think that your Pyramid
UFO video

1964
01:31:59.067 --> 01:32:00.700
would fall in these buckets?

1965
01:32:00.733 --> 01:32:03.067
They would fall into
the place where I get my mail.

1966
01:32:03.067 --> 01:32:04.700
-into other.
That's where I live.
-[Josh laughs]

1967
01:32:04.733 --> 01:32:06.667
I mean.
do they look aerodynamic

1968
01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:08.333
to you if you're gonna
build something?

1969
01:32:08.367 --> 01:32:10.367
Some kind of a drone.
an earthly drone.

1970
01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:12.433
Would you make it
Pyramid shaped? I wouldn't.

1971
01:32:12.467 --> 01:32:15.067
[Josh] Exactly. Now. Nick.
looking at these different
categories

1972
01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:17.333
which is more.
you know. concerning?

1973
01:32:17.367 --> 01:32:20.600
-Foreign adversary
systems or other?
-Other.

1974
01:32:20.633 --> 01:32:23.800
It's a little word but it's
a scary word in this context.

1975
01:32:23.833 --> 01:32:27.233
You can pick up the phone
and talk to your adversary
through diplomacy.

1976
01:32:27.267 --> 01:32:29.833
We can't talk to
these people if...

1977
01:32:29.867 --> 01:32:32.067
Who are whatever they are.
We don't know.

1978
01:32:32.067 --> 01:32:34.100
Personally. I would go
with airborne clutter.

1979
01:32:34.133 --> 01:32:35.667
but I'm afraid of birds.

1980
01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:39.833
Uh. okay. listen. based on
these incredible videos
that we saw tonight.

1981
01:32:39.867 --> 01:32:43.067
let's talk about your top
UAP sightings and why.

1982
01:32:43.067 --> 01:32:45.100
Let's just go rapid fire
down the line here.

1983
01:32:45.133 --> 01:32:46.467
What about for you. Jeremy?

1984
01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:49.933
My favorite is 1989 Bob Lazar
right here in Las Vegas.
Nevada.

1985
01:32:49.967 --> 01:32:51.767
But after what
we've seen tonight.

1986
01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:53.133
it's the cases that
I've worked on.

1987
01:32:53.167 --> 01:32:56.867
So the USS Omaha and all
the corroborative sensor data

1988
01:32:56.900 --> 01:32:58.433
and information
and visual evidence

1989
01:32:58.467 --> 01:33:00.467
that George and I have been
able to provide to the public

1990
01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:03.467
makes it one of the most
robust cases we've ever had
with UFOs.

1991
01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:05.700
Right. 'Cause it's not just
one piece of footage.

1992
01:33:05.733 --> 01:33:07.400
You've got night vision.
you've got radar.

1993
01:33:07.433 --> 01:33:09.400
you've got FLIR. it's kind of
the whole package.

1994
01:33:09.433 --> 01:33:11.867
And you have now footage
from the deck of the Omaha.

1995
01:33:11.900 --> 01:33:14.533
Exactly. okay. So.
George. what about you?

1996
01:33:14.567 --> 01:33:15.767
For me it's the Tic Tac.

1997
01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:17.967
I think it's the most
important UFO in history.

1998
01:33:18.067 --> 01:33:20.333
Because of what it is meant
to where we are now.

1999
01:33:20.367 --> 01:33:22.967
I mean. the credibility
of those witnesses.

2000
01:33:23.067 --> 01:33:24.767
the pilots.
Dave Fravor and others.

2001
01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:28.500
they've gone before congress
with the help of two former
intelligence officials

2002
01:33:28.533 --> 01:33:30.233
Luis Elizondo
and Chris Mellon.

2003
01:33:30.267 --> 01:33:33.200
Who gave up government
service to push this ball
down the field.

2004
01:33:33.233 --> 01:33:35.400
That video is
what sold that story.

2005
01:33:35.433 --> 01:33:37.067
It got The New York Times
to cover it.

2006
01:33:37.100 --> 01:33:38.500
60 Minutes to cover it.

2007
01:33:38.533 --> 01:33:41.300
and it was the reason that
we have a UAP task force.

2008
01:33:41.333 --> 01:33:42.567
Certainly changed the game.

2009
01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:44.800
Absolutely. And. Nick Pope.
what about you?

2010
01:33:44.833 --> 01:33:46.067
I'm gearing for Gimbal.

2011
01:33:46.067 --> 01:33:49.767
When these normally
unflappable pilots
get excited.

2012
01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:51.333
I get excited. too.

2013
01:33:51.367 --> 01:33:54.400
But look. there are a lot of
UFO videos on the Internet.

2014
01:33:54.433 --> 01:33:57.833
But what makes these really
stand out. and Gimbal's
part of this.

2015
01:33:57.867 --> 01:34:01.500
is that the Department of
Defense have put it on
their own website

2016
01:34:01.533 --> 01:34:04.100
and issued a press release
to say it's genuine.

2017
01:34:04.133 --> 01:34:06.233
So. we've got
the provenance of it.

2018
01:34:06.267 --> 01:34:09.500
I'm with you. The Gimbal video
for me is really the most...

2019
01:34:09.533 --> 01:34:13.667
the most intriguing
just because of how
these unflappable pilots.

2020
01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:16.733
these guys that normally have
this right stuff attitude.

2021
01:34:16.767 --> 01:34:19.133
they are just freaking out
for lack of a better term

2022
01:34:19.167 --> 01:34:20.633
about they're encountering
up there.

2023
01:34:20.667 --> 01:34:23.333
There's something about that
that just makes it
so compelling.

2024
01:34:23.367 --> 01:34:25.233
All right. so let's check
in with Jessica

2025
01:34:25.267 --> 01:34:27.533
and our ever expanding
Twitter feed.

2026
01:34:27.567 --> 01:34:30.667
Thank you. Josh.
Here's what's happening
over on social.

2027
01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:32.767
Bring it up. All right.
Joseph writes. [reading].

2028
01:34:37.233 --> 01:34:39.067
Jeremy. you want
to take that one?

2029
01:34:39.100 --> 01:34:41.200
Yeah. I think we can handle.
We know we can handle.

2030
01:34:41.233 --> 01:34:42.633
We have a right to know.
a need to know

2031
01:34:42.667 --> 01:34:45.967
and I feel a duty to find out
the truth about UFOs.

2032
01:34:46.067 --> 01:34:47.967
All right. thanks. Jeremy
and thanks. Joseph.

2033
01:34:48.067 --> 01:34:53.500
Keep sending your clips
and comments in using
the #UFOsDeclassifedLIVE.

2034
01:34:53.533 --> 01:34:56.300
All right. Well. next up.
we're going to dig deep

2035
01:34:56.333 --> 01:34:58.900
into our controversial history
with UFOs.

2036
01:34:58.933 --> 01:35:02.867
Plus. we have
that gripping footage
from the deck of the USS Omaha

2037
01:35:02.900 --> 01:35:06.100
when UFOs Declassified:
LIVE returns.

2038
01:35:28.067 --> 01:35:31.367
You're watching
UFOs Declassified: LIVE.
I'm Josh Gates.

2039
01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:34.933
As the pentagon
report indicates.
the public in general

2040
01:35:34.967 --> 01:35:39.267
has been hesitant to disclose
UAP sightings
because of the stigma

2041
01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:41.400
associated with
UFO eye witnesses.

2042
01:35:41.433 --> 01:35:45.600
But research shows
that these UAP sightings
have been going on

2043
01:35:45.633 --> 01:35:48.167
for years and years.
Take a look.

2044
01:35:49.633 --> 01:35:53.933
[Nick Pope] People think that
with these US navy sightings.

2045
01:35:53.967 --> 01:35:56.600
some people think this is new.
it's not new.

2046
01:35:56.633 --> 01:35:58.967
It's been going on
since the dawn of time.

2047
01:36:02.467 --> 01:36:06.167
Myths. legends.these things.
whatever they are.

2048
01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:08.100
have been seen
throughout history.

2049
01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:13.567
[Jim Semivan] After
World War II.
the world was very different.

2050
01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:18.067
and we had exploded
a nuclear bomb over
Nagasaki and Hiroshima.

2051
01:36:18.067 --> 01:36:20.500
That changed everything.

2052
01:36:20.533 --> 01:36:24.200
Now. people start seeing
unidentified flying objects

2053
01:36:24.233 --> 01:36:26.167
and they're coming
over military bases

2054
01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:27.800
and we don't know
what to do about it.

2055
01:36:30.067 --> 01:36:35.733
[Nick] One of the central
pieces to the UFO back story
is Roswell.

2056
01:36:35.767 --> 01:36:38.867
Something crashed
in the New Mexico Desert.

2057
01:36:38.900 --> 01:36:41.800
From that moment on.
two things happened.

2058
01:36:41.833 --> 01:36:45.400
Firstly the U.S. government
knew that we're not alone.

2059
01:36:45.433 --> 01:36:50.133
and secondly.
a vast conspiracy emerged

2060
01:36:50.167 --> 01:36:52.133
to cover this truth up.

2061
01:36:52.167 --> 01:36:54.400
Believers say
alien spacecraft.

2062
01:36:54.433 --> 01:36:57.667
Skeptics say weather balloon.

2063
01:37:00.067 --> 01:37:02.067
Whatever happened at Roswell.

2064
01:37:02.067 --> 01:37:07.733
it's now so embedded
in people's awareness
as part of pop culture

2065
01:37:07.767 --> 01:37:12.800
and continues to fire people's
interest and imagination.

2066
01:37:12.833 --> 01:37:17.133
And maybe what happened
at Roswell was the start
of all this.

2067
01:37:17.167 --> 01:37:19.533
at least the start
in the modern era.

2068
01:37:22.133 --> 01:37:25.833
[Keith Melton] In 1953.
the CIA created
the Robertson panel.

2069
01:37:25.867 --> 01:37:30.533
It said that there was
no direct threat from UFOs.

2070
01:37:30.567 --> 01:37:35.900
But most important.
they said the real danger
wasn't from UFOs.

2071
01:37:35.933 --> 01:37:39.300
but it was from thousands
of UFO sightings

2072
01:37:39.333 --> 01:37:42.900
would overwhelm
our reporting capabilities

2073
01:37:42.933 --> 01:37:45.867
and mask a soviet air attack.

2074
01:37:45.900 --> 01:37:50.467
And as a result. they made
a concerted effort to debunk

2075
01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:53.467
and demystify UFOs

2076
01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:56.400
and any people associated
with it.

2077
01:37:56.433 --> 01:38:00.533
If people watch closely.
they'll notice we tend to use

2078
01:38:00.567 --> 01:38:03.900
the phrase UAP and not UFO.

2079
01:38:03.933 --> 01:38:07.167
It's just a way of getting rid
of the stigma

2080
01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:10.367
that comes with the term UFO.
and it's just a way.

2081
01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:14.733
this is really important.
to get the senior
stakeholder engagement

2082
01:38:14.767 --> 01:38:19.600
from within government.
the military and
the intelligence community.

2083
01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:23.533
Well. joining Nick Pope
on our panel.

2084
01:38:23.567 --> 01:38:26.233
our former CIA officer.
Jim Semivan

2085
01:38:26.267 --> 01:38:28.900
and intelligence historian.
Keith Melton.

2086
01:38:28.933 --> 01:38:30.667
-Welcome to both of you.
-[both] Thank you.

2087
01:38:30.700 --> 01:38:36.100
Okay. so. you know.
when we talk about the history
of UFO sightings.

2088
01:38:36.133 --> 01:38:39.800
they may well go back
into pre-history.

2089
01:38:39.833 --> 01:38:43.800
But I think most Americans
think of Roswell as
the beginning of it all.

2090
01:38:43.833 --> 01:38:45.333
Why?

2091
01:38:45.367 --> 01:38:50.200
Well. actually the first major
UFO incident took place
one month earlier.

2092
01:38:50.233 --> 01:38:51.900
-Before Roswell?
-Before.

2093
01:38:51.933 --> 01:38:55.267
When a private pilot
flying near
Mount Raniere. Washington.

2094
01:38:55.300 --> 01:39:00.300
observed nine flying discs
in formation traveling

2095
01:39:00.333 --> 01:39:02.533
at speeds between
Mach 2 and Mach 3.

2096
01:39:02.567 --> 01:39:05.267
The next day.
it made nationwide headlines.

2097
01:39:05.300 --> 01:39:09.200
And one newspaper coined
the term "flying saucers."

2098
01:39:09.233 --> 01:39:10.900
-That's where it all started.
-It started there.

2099
01:39:10.933 --> 01:39:12.167
At least
in our popular culture.

2100
01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:16.233
Why do you think Roswell gets
the glory as it were?

2101
01:39:16.267 --> 01:39:20.067
It has become popularized
certainly after 1970.

2102
01:39:20.067 --> 01:39:25.433
But from 1947 to 1970. very
little was written about it.

2103
01:39:25.467 --> 01:39:29.467
Let's talk about area 51
and how that fits
into the Roswell story.

2104
01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:32.600
There is no direct connection

2105
01:39:32.633 --> 01:39:38.367
between Roswell in 1947
and area 51 in 1955.

2106
01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:42.967
It didn't even
begin construction
until August of 1955.

2107
01:39:43.067 --> 01:39:45.900
And yet. they're always
thought of in the same breath.

2108
01:39:45.933 --> 01:39:49.867
In the context
that if there were technology.

2109
01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:54.133
foreign adversarial technology
that would likely have been
the place.

2110
01:39:54.167 --> 01:39:58.567
But actually at the time.
it would have probably gone
to Patterson air force base.

2111
01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:02.567
It would have been
a much more likely scenario
in that theory.

2112
01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:05.133
One of the things I found.
Jim. interesting
in the package

2113
01:40:05.167 --> 01:40:09.967
is you mentioned that
the bombings in World War II
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki

2114
01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:13.533
really coincide
with the beginnings
of a lot of these UFO reports.

2115
01:40:13.567 --> 01:40:16.533
Do you think there is
an actual connection
between these events?

2116
01:40:16.567 --> 01:40:22.767
Yeah. I think so. In 1945.
a squadron of Hellcat Fighters

2117
01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:26.867
were trying to intercept a UFO
that was hovering

2118
01:40:26.900 --> 01:40:32.167
over a han ford plutonium
production facility
in Washington state.

2119
01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:33.900
Now. they did this over
three nights.

2120
01:40:33.933 --> 01:40:35.933
They went after these UFOs
over three nights.

2121
01:40:35.967 --> 01:40:38.000
and obviously
didn't catch them.

2122
01:40:38.033 --> 01:40:42.600
But this occurred seven months
before the bombs went off.

2123
01:40:42.633 --> 01:40:45.800
before the atomic bombs
went off in Hiroshima
and Nagasaki.

2124
01:40:45.833 --> 01:40:48.367
And what this indicates
to me is

2125
01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:52.333
that these UAPs
were interested
in our nuclear technology

2126
01:40:52.367 --> 01:40:54.433
at the very beginning
of the nuclear age.

2127
01:40:54.467 --> 01:40:59.367
One of the things I read
that sounded either outlandish
or terrifying or both.

2128
01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:02.900
I don't know. is that some
former air force personnel

2129
01:41:02.933 --> 01:41:05.967
testified not just
that UAPs exist.

2130
01:41:06.067 --> 01:41:10.133
but that they have
the capability
to neutralize nuclear weapons.

2131
01:41:10.167 --> 01:41:12.200
Is there any evidence
of that really?

2132
01:41:12.233 --> 01:41:15.833
Yes. And allegedly.

2133
01:41:15.867 --> 01:41:21.133
But there are a few instances
where UAPs were seen

2134
01:41:21.167 --> 01:41:27.433
over ICBM sites
and that they were
allegedly interfering

2135
01:41:27.467 --> 01:41:28.800
with their launch activity.

2136
01:41:28.833 --> 01:41:30.567
Now this happened
in Russia too.

2137
01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:34.267
it happened numerous times
in Russia actually. so we have
seen this before.

2138
01:41:34.300 --> 01:41:37.167
Nick. one of the things
that is curious here is

2139
01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:39.900
we have talked in this country
about UFOs.

2140
01:41:39.933 --> 01:41:42.067
certainly in popular culture
for a long time.

2141
01:41:42.100 --> 01:41:43.367
But look at what we have now.

2142
01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:46.400
We've got this official
pentagon report.

2143
01:41:46.433 --> 01:41:50.467
Do you think the release
of this report changes

2144
01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:54.167
the perception in the culture
around UFOs?

2145
01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:57.500
Completely. I think it was
regarded as fringe.

2146
01:41:57.533 --> 01:42:00.767
It's now main stream.
People thought about it
in terms

2147
01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:02.967
of science fiction
and conspiracy theory.

2148
01:42:03.067 --> 01:42:07.067
They're now framing it
correctly as defense
and national security issue.

2149
01:42:07.100 --> 01:42:09.900
So it's completely
changed the narrative. yes.

2150
01:42:09.933 --> 01:42:12.300
Do you think that when people
read in this report

2151
01:42:12.333 --> 01:42:18.300
that 143 out of 144
of these sightings
are unexplained.

2152
01:42:18.333 --> 01:42:19.767
that they should be worried?

2153
01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:22.800
Yeah. I think it's like
if you can't explain
that many of them.

2154
01:42:22.833 --> 01:42:26.067
well. go back and take
another look. Could do better.

2155
01:42:26.067 --> 01:42:28.633
Yeah. so you think people
should be nervous by this
to some extent?

2156
01:42:28.667 --> 01:42:30.800
They should. If there's
anything in our skies.

2157
01:42:30.833 --> 01:42:32.800
particularly with
these technologies.

2158
01:42:32.833 --> 01:42:35.233
then absolutely.
we must be concerned.

2159
01:42:35.267 --> 01:42:39.300
And Congress is concerned.
Hence the interest.
continuing interest.

2160
01:42:39.333 --> 01:42:41.567
-This report is just
the beginning.
-All right.

2161
01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:43.300
Thank you very much.
We're gonna take a break here.

2162
01:42:43.333 --> 01:42:47.500
When we return. we have got
that must-see footage from
the deck of the USS Omaha

2163
01:42:47.533 --> 01:42:50.067
and it is almost time
to bang the gavel

2164
01:42:50.067 --> 01:42:53.400
and find out
what the verdict is
from our experts. adversaries.

2165
01:42:53.433 --> 01:42:54.933
aliens. neither.

2166
01:42:54.967 --> 01:42:58.500
And don't forget to share
your thoughts on UAPs
on Twitter

2167
01:42:58.533 --> 01:43:01.633
using the
#UFOsDeclassifiedLIVE.

2168
01:43:01.667 --> 01:43:02.533
We'll be right back.

2169
01:43:25.867 --> 01:43:29.767
[Josh] Looking at our poll.
when asked.
"What's inside area 51?"

2170
01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:31.167
Looks like a pretty tight race

2171
01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:35.067
between an ET spaceship
and military equipment.

2172
01:43:35.100 --> 01:43:38.467
Welcome back
to UFOs Declassified: LIVE.

2173
01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:42.400
I'm Josh Gates along
with UAP/UFO experts.

2174
01:43:42.433 --> 01:43:46.267
Jeremy Corbell.
Jim Semivan and Nick Pope.

2175
01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:49.600
Now. as promised. we have
brand-new footage

2176
01:43:49.633 --> 01:43:53.200
from the swarming event
above the USS Omaha.

2177
01:43:53.233 --> 01:43:57.767
Get ready for this.
We've already seen incredible
radar and flir imagery.

2178
01:43:57.800 --> 01:44:02.100
Now. we have a brand-new angle
on this same historic event.

2179
01:44:02.133 --> 01:44:03.100
Take a look.

2180
01:44:05.167 --> 01:44:06.933
All right. Jeremy.
let's talk about this.

2181
01:44:06.967 --> 01:44:09.300
What are we seeing
in this footage?

2182
01:44:09.333 --> 01:44:12.067
[Jeremy] Right.
so you're seeing
corroborative video evidence.

2183
01:44:12.067 --> 01:44:14.667
All the other videos
that George Knapp
and I have put out.

2184
01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:15.767
they've been confirmed

2185
01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:18.567
by the pentagon as being
true unidentified UFOs.

2186
01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:20.867
Part of a study.
what you're seeing here

2187
01:44:20.900 --> 01:44:22.833
is video footage
from the USS Omaha.

2188
01:44:22.867 --> 01:44:25.667
You see the lights.
they're lit up.
That's really important.

2189
01:44:25.700 --> 01:44:27.600
It's the first time
you're seeing footage of this.

2190
01:44:27.633 --> 01:44:30.900
[Josh] And so. how long
did this event go on for?

2191
01:44:30.933 --> 01:44:32.900
[Jeremy] This is actually
over a number of days

2192
01:44:32.933 --> 01:44:37.633
where it came to a highlight
on the 15th of July. 2019.

2193
01:44:37.667 --> 01:44:39.133
[Josh] So. we see
these lights.

2194
01:44:39.167 --> 01:44:42.800
We can see some blinking here.
I know we have
this flair and radar also.

2195
01:44:42.833 --> 01:44:45.267
but now we do know
this isn't an aircraft?

2196
01:44:45.300 --> 01:44:47.167
How do we know we're not
seeing a helicopter hovering?

2197
01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:50.233
Right. so this is well studied
by our United States military.

2198
01:44:50.267 --> 01:44:54.267
It's part of the UAPTF
task force. like.
investigation into this.

2199
01:44:54.300 --> 01:44:56.633
This is a confirmed
UFO sighting.

2200
01:44:56.667 --> 01:44:59.400
They don't know where
they landed. They don't know
where they took off from.

2201
01:44:59.433 --> 01:45:02.767
This is a true UFO case
with great data.

2202
01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:04.733
There were 14 of these things
at one point

2203
01:45:04.767 --> 01:45:07.167
around the USS Omaha.
completely surrounding it.

2204
01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:10.200
They pop on and off radar
over a period
of several hours.

2205
01:45:10.233 --> 01:45:12.633
That one was recorded
on the thermal images

2206
01:45:12.667 --> 01:45:15.067
that travel along
with the ship for an hour.

2207
01:45:15.067 --> 01:45:18.200
Earlier I asked you
what your favorite video
from tonight is.

2208
01:45:18.233 --> 01:45:19.567
anybody want to change
their answers?

2209
01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:22.133
I mean. how much
of a game changer
do you think this video is?

2210
01:45:22.167 --> 01:45:24.533
Altogether. this video
is so important

2211
01:45:24.567 --> 01:45:27.567
because again. it supports
an entire event series

2212
01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:31.667
as one of the most
well-documented UFO cases
of all time now.

2213
01:45:31.700 --> 01:45:35.067
And so. you know. taking
all that evidence together.

2214
01:45:35.067 --> 01:45:36.833
it does seem
really compelling. doesn't it?

2215
01:45:36.867 --> 01:45:39.667
-It is absolutely compelling.
-So. okay.

2216
01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:43.533
You know. George.
you've been at the forefront
of this field for years.

2217
01:45:43.567 --> 01:45:45.300
what's your reaction
to this video?

2218
01:45:45.333 --> 01:45:49.067
Well. it's important because
you have three different forms
of evidence to document it.

2219
01:45:49.100 --> 01:45:51.967
And I presume there are
other cases like that.

2220
01:45:52.067 --> 01:45:54.933
that they
are censored information
that the pentagon has

2221
01:45:54.967 --> 01:45:57.600
that is too sensitive
to release to us.
to the public.

2222
01:45:57.633 --> 01:45:59.700
It is classified
for a good reason.

2223
01:45:59.733 --> 01:46:02.267
As it was told to me
by an intelligence official.

2224
01:46:02.300 --> 01:46:04.467
you can't tell your friends
without telling your enemies.

2225
01:46:04.500 --> 01:46:07.067
So. there are good reasons for
keeping some of this secret.

2226
01:46:07.067 --> 01:46:09.500
But this clearly is
a pretty solid case.

2227
01:46:09.533 --> 01:46:12.800
Nick. how seriously should
this incident be taken?

2228
01:46:12.833 --> 01:46:15.600
Very seriously.
Something is toying with us.

2229
01:46:15.633 --> 01:46:17.367
It's like playing cat
and mouse with us.

2230
01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:20.167
And I know some of us
with governmental backgrounds

2231
01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:22.767
get accused of pushing
the threat narrative here.

2232
01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:25.667
But come on. you've got to say
when these sorts of things

2233
01:46:25.700 --> 01:46:28.100
get close
to our U.S. military assets.

2234
01:46:28.133 --> 01:46:31.500
whether they're aircraft
carrier. destroyers.
maybe jets. whatever they are.

2235
01:46:31.533 --> 01:46:34.533
that has got to be seen
as a potential threat.

2236
01:46:34.567 --> 01:46:36.267
Okay. We're going
to take a break here.

2237
01:46:36.300 --> 01:46:39.267
but you're not going to want
to miss what's coming up.

2238
01:46:39.300 --> 01:46:42.367
Our panelists
will be delivering
their final verdict.

2239
01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:44.967
adversary. extraterrestrial
or neither.

2240
01:46:45.067 --> 01:46:50.333
Please keep launching
your tweets our way
with #UFOsDeclassifiedLIVE.

2241
01:46:50.367 --> 01:46:51.733
More to come after this.

2242
01:47:10.267 --> 01:47:14.067
We are back with more
UFOs Declassified: LIVE.

2243
01:47:14.067 --> 01:47:17.067
I'm Josh Gates. For most
of us. our only exposure

2244
01:47:17.067 --> 01:47:20.767
to the idea
of extraterrestrial life
has come from television

2245
01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:24.067
and movies from
The Twilight Zone
to Independence Day.

2246
01:47:24.100 --> 01:47:27.067
So. how does Hollywood compare
to the real deal?

2247
01:47:28.733 --> 01:47:32.833
Hollywood has always been
a teller of sci-fi stories.

2248
01:47:32.867 --> 01:47:36.900
I think for entertaining
the audience about UFOs

2249
01:47:36.933 --> 01:47:42.667
and I think UFO movies
play into our great ignorance
of the world around us.

2250
01:47:44.167 --> 01:47:47.367
[Barry] One of the things
that's always been out there.

2251
01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:53.533
did we create interest in UFOs
or the fact that people

2252
01:47:53.567 --> 01:47:55.867
were interested
in those things.

2253
01:47:55.900 --> 01:47:59.900
did we take advantage
and create what our vision

2254
01:48:00.067 --> 01:48:01.667
of what those images
would look like?

2255
01:48:03.133 --> 01:48:06.833
[Nick] There is an interesting
conspiracy theory

2256
01:48:06.867 --> 01:48:10.267
that some Hollywood movies
are actually part

2257
01:48:10.300 --> 01:48:13.367
of a government campaign
to acclimatize people

2258
01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:15.100
to an
extraterrestrial reality.

2259
01:48:16.300 --> 01:48:18.767
Hollywood has had
a huge impact in terms

2260
01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:22.267
of how we conceptualize
extraterrestrial life forms

2261
01:48:22.300 --> 01:48:25.433
intermingling with life
on earth.

2262
01:48:25.467 --> 01:48:31.833
I have met people that I truly
believe could be aliens.

2263
01:48:31.867 --> 01:48:33.600
When we would scout
Men in Black.

2264
01:48:33.633 --> 01:48:37.100
we would drive around New York
and look out the window

2265
01:48:37.133 --> 01:48:43.067
and go. alien. alien.
It's possible they're here.

2266
01:48:43.067 --> 01:48:49.267
[Jonathan] Hollywood created
the look and the sound
of UFOs and flying saucers.

2267
01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:52.467
But it's really the movies
of Hollywood starting
in the 1950s

2268
01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:57.067
that give us the definitive
image of those flying saucers.

2269
01:48:57.067 --> 01:49:00.067
And it's impact
on our perception of UFOs

2270
01:49:00.067 --> 01:49:04.167
has been tremendous.
probably bigger
than any other media.

2271
01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:07.800
If used correctly.
Hollywood is an
incredible platform

2272
01:49:07.833 --> 01:49:09.800
to enlighten people.

2273
01:49:09.833 --> 01:49:12.067
I think it will
make people want

2274
01:49:12.067 --> 01:49:14.933
to work on it. study it.
understand it.

2275
01:49:14.967 --> 01:49:17.767
get people really interested
and excited

2276
01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:21.400
about dealing with UFOs
that are more than just
a craft in the sky.

2277
01:49:23.067 --> 01:49:26.600
Hollywood has actually
produced much better CGI video

2278
01:49:26.633 --> 01:49:29.433
than the Navy pilots have.

2279
01:49:29.467 --> 01:49:33.067
That's cause for some question
in itself is that.

2280
01:49:33.067 --> 01:49:38.467
are we too now saturated
with video CGI images

2281
01:49:38.500 --> 01:49:42.867
and has this now made us less
likely to believe what we see?

2282
01:49:47.067 --> 01:49:50.867
Joining Nick Pope and I
on the panel is our own
Jessica Chobot.

2283
01:49:50.900 --> 01:49:54.767
-Welcome to
the big desk. Jess.
-I'm so stoked to be here.

2284
01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:56.300
Good to have you here.

2285
01:49:56.333 --> 01:50:02.133
Okay. let's talk movies.
I know you are a major
pop culture and movie buff.

2286
01:50:02.167 --> 01:50:03.467
by which I mean a huge nerd.

2287
01:50:03.500 --> 01:50:06.133
-Yes.
-What is the best

2288
01:50:06.167 --> 01:50:09.400
extraterrestrial alien
movie ever made
in your opinion?

2289
01:50:09.433 --> 01:50:12.667
Ever made. Well. I've got
a lot that I like a lot.

2290
01:50:12.700 --> 01:50:15.000
but I would have to say
They Live.

2291
01:50:15.033 --> 01:50:16.833
-Oh. They Live?
-Yeah. yeah.

2292
01:50:16.867 --> 01:50:19.333
John Carpenter.
Amazing special effects.

2293
01:50:19.367 --> 01:50:22.567
-Questionable acting.
-I don't think so.

2294
01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:24.567
-Come on.
-It's a classic.

2295
01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:26.033
It is a classic.
It is a classic.

2296
01:50:26.067 --> 01:50:28.033
Nick Pope. what about for you?

2297
01:50:28.067 --> 01:50:29.333
- Arrival.
-Yeah.

2298
01:50:29.367 --> 01:50:31.200
Because I think it speaks
to a lot of the issues

2299
01:50:31.233 --> 01:50:34.267
people are thinking about
right now with this report
to Congress.

2300
01:50:34.300 --> 01:50:39.533
I mean. it's not just
about aliens. It's about us
and our response.

2301
01:50:39.567 --> 01:50:43.167
Do we respond with hope
or fear. with the hand
of friendship

2302
01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:45.300
-or guns and bombs?
-That's right.

2303
01:50:45.333 --> 01:50:47.200
I have to say it's kind of
an impossible question.

2304
01:50:47.233 --> 01:50:49.467
There are so many
great alien movies.

2305
01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:52.733
How about Alien
or the greatest sequel
of all time. Aliens.

2306
01:50:52.767 --> 01:50:54.100
I thought you were going
to say Prometheus.

2307
01:50:54.133 --> 01:50:55.567
And I was gonna be like.
"You gotta leave!"

2308
01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:58.500
-Not Prometheus.
but the other ones.
- [laughs]

2309
01:50:58.533 --> 01:51:02.400
I mean for me personally.
when I was a kid.

2310
01:51:02.433 --> 01:51:07.067
I used to love really
old sci-fi. I used to love
The Day the Earth Stood Still.

2311
01:51:07.067 --> 01:51:09.067
Forbidden Planet.

2312
01:51:09.100 --> 01:51:12.067
I was a huge fan
of Twilight Zone.
the TV series

2313
01:51:12.067 --> 01:51:13.500
the reruns of that
when I was a kid.

2314
01:51:13.533 --> 01:51:16.900
And I have to say. you know.
The Monsters Are Due
on Maple Street

2315
01:51:16.933 --> 01:51:20.500
and Nightmare at 20.000 Feet.
Will the Real Martian
Please Stand Up?

2316
01:51:20.533 --> 01:51:23.833
Those old. kind of. you know.
Cold War era stories

2317
01:51:23.867 --> 01:51:26.800
that were also. again.
speaking to people's fears.

2318
01:51:26.833 --> 01:51:30.700
That was the stuff that got me
into science fiction
and into this topic.

2319
01:51:30.733 --> 01:51:33.700
Because there is something
about extraterrestrials

2320
01:51:33.733 --> 01:51:36.600
that's also very human.
Does that make sense. Nick?

2321
01:51:36.633 --> 01:51:40.067
Yes. it does. We look out
but at the same time.
we look in.

2322
01:51:40.067 --> 01:51:46.067
It's not just about aliens
but it's about us.
who are we as a species?

2323
01:51:46.067 --> 01:51:49.333
How would we respond
if we find out
that we're not alone?

2324
01:51:49.367 --> 01:51:51.667
You know. one of the things
that you mention in the piece.

2325
01:51:51.700 --> 01:51:55.200
Nick. is that some people
believe that Hollywood.

2326
01:51:55.233 --> 01:51:59.067
you know. is part of a kind of
conspiracy to acclimate us

2327
01:51:59.067 --> 01:52:02.400
to the possibility of an
extraterrestrial arrival.

2328
01:52:02.433 --> 01:52:04.200
I'm not sure I put much stock
in that.

2329
01:52:04.233 --> 01:52:05.900
-Do you think that's true?
-No.

2330
01:52:05.933 --> 01:52:09.233
Not really to acclimate us
to that

2331
01:52:09.267 --> 01:52:12.833
or even indoctrinate us
to say they're a threat.

2332
01:52:12.867 --> 01:52:15.467
Bur look. I think that
there are so many movies.

2333
01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:18.133
Some with good aliens.
some with bad aliens

2334
01:52:18.167 --> 01:52:20.833
that it's a funny
indoctrination campaign

2335
01:52:20.867 --> 01:52:22.667
if we're getting all
these mixed messages.

2336
01:52:22.700 --> 01:52:25.167
Can I jump in really
quick though and say

2337
01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:27.933
it's not the first time
Hollywood worked
with the government

2338
01:52:27.967 --> 01:52:30.367
to pull the wool over
people's eyes. So who knows?

2339
01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:31.833
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

2340
01:52:31.867 --> 01:52:33.800
- Argo.
-Oh. Argo.

2341
01:52:33.833 --> 01:52:36.800
I thought you were going
moon landing.
I was getting very worried.

2342
01:52:36.833 --> 01:52:39.833
-No. no. no.
-Don't go crazy on me here.

2343
01:52:39.867 --> 01:52:42.767
I'm talking about other times
they made deals

2344
01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:45.967
with the U.S. to try
to accomplish things.

2345
01:52:46.067 --> 01:52:47.833
-But not that.
-Not that.

2346
01:52:47.867 --> 01:52:50.967
If this was
a Hollywood conspiracy.

2347
01:52:51.067 --> 01:52:54.567
all movies would be E.T.
right. they would
all be warm and fuzzy.

2348
01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:56.233
We wouldn't have Species.

2349
01:52:56.267 --> 01:52:58.667
Or all the other way
to ourselves.

2350
01:52:58.700 --> 01:53:01.067
That's right.
That's exactly right.
We'd be terrified by that.

2351
01:53:01.067 --> 01:53:04.433
We're going to take a break.
A pleasure as always talking
to both of you.

2352
01:53:04.467 --> 01:53:08.500
Okay. so what television show.
movie. pop culture moment

2353
01:53:08.533 --> 01:53:11.067
do you think is
the most accurate depiction

2354
01:53:11.067 --> 01:53:12.833
of what's really out there?
Tell us now

2355
01:53:12.867 --> 01:53:16.633
using #UFOsDeclassifiedLIVE
on Twitter.

2356
01:53:16.667 --> 01:53:19.067
And after the break.
I'll be speaking with the man

2357
01:53:19.067 --> 01:53:23.133
who is largely responsible
for initiating
the pentagon report.

2358
01:53:23.167 --> 01:53:26.900
former senate majority leader
Harry Reid will be joining us.

2359
01:53:26.933 --> 01:53:29.233
And you won't believe
what he has to say.

2360
01:53:29.267 --> 01:53:31.167
And our panel will
reach their verdict

2361
01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:34.567
when UFOs Declassified:
LIVE returns.

2362
01:54:05.067 --> 01:54:08.400
Welcome back to
UFOs Declassified: LIVE.

2363
01:54:08.433 --> 01:54:10.533
I'm Josh Gates.
As you know by now.

2364
01:54:10.567 --> 01:54:14.267
information on UAPs became
declassified this week

2365
01:54:14.300 --> 01:54:17.133
when the pentagon UFO report
became public.

2366
01:54:17.167 --> 01:54:19.067
Right now. we're going
to speak to the man

2367
01:54:19.067 --> 01:54:21.233
who many call the man
the god father of this report.

2368
01:54:21.267 --> 01:54:24.333
former governor and senate
majority leader Harry Reid.

2369
01:54:24.367 --> 01:54:26.467
Thank you
for joining us. Senator.

2370
01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:28.067
Really my pleasure.

2371
01:54:28.067 --> 01:54:30.067
Look. I think a lot
of Americans
were pretty surprised

2372
01:54:30.100 --> 01:54:35.867
to wake up a few days ago
to see the pentagon put out
an official report on UFOs.

2373
01:54:35.900 --> 01:54:39.100
When you got the ball
rolling on this in 2007.

2374
01:54:39.133 --> 01:54:41.533
did you think it would lead
to a public report like this?

2375
01:54:42.533 --> 01:54:47.100
I didn't give it
much thought frankly.

2376
01:54:47.133 --> 01:54:53.433
I was just trying to show that
the occurrences of these UFOs

2377
01:54:53.467 --> 01:54:56.700
was not something
that was a figment
of someone's imagination.

2378
01:54:56.733 --> 01:54:59.067
They actually took place.

2379
01:54:59.067 --> 01:55:04.500
And as we know now.
we spent $22 million
of the government's money

2380
01:55:04.533 --> 01:55:08.067
and we proved that these
are actual sightings

2381
01:55:08.100 --> 01:55:10.600
that people had
for a long. long time.

2382
01:55:10.633 --> 01:55:13.867
So. I didn't know
if they had cut out the report

2383
01:55:13.900 --> 01:55:19.400
the report frankly that
they came out with
is pretty sparse. pretty slim.

2384
01:55:19.433 --> 01:55:23.400
And I would hope
that it is not one and done.

2385
01:55:23.433 --> 01:55:26.067
I think if we're going to do
a good job on this.

2386
01:55:26.100 --> 01:55:29.800
we need to make sure
the government is involved
on it on a continuous basis.

2387
01:55:29.833 --> 01:55:33.933
And this slim. slim report
is not good enough.

2388
01:55:33.967 --> 01:55:37.300
What do you think American
should take away
from this report

2389
01:55:37.333 --> 01:55:39.667
or what do you find
most interesting in it?

2390
01:55:39.700 --> 01:55:43.100
Well. I'm glad the government
is acknowledging

2391
01:55:43.133 --> 01:55:47.333
that there's something
that needs to be looked into.

2392
01:55:47.367 --> 01:55:52.800
My concern is it was
just so weak in facts.

2393
01:55:52.833 --> 01:55:58.233
If anybody reads this.
they won't know much more

2394
01:55:58.267 --> 01:56:00.667
after reading it than
before they started.

2395
01:56:00.700 --> 01:56:04.067
And look. the report
doesn't specifically point

2396
01:56:04.067 --> 01:56:07.367
to an extraterrestrial origin
for these sightings.

2397
01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:12.367
Do you think it exonerates
foreign players though.
China or Russia?

2398
01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:16.833
Could these be. you know.
high-tech objects
from other countries?

2399
01:56:16.867 --> 01:56:19.667
-I don't think we can
eliminate anything.
-Right.

2400
01:56:19.700 --> 01:56:21.467
I think we should have
an open mind.

2401
01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:26.300
My personal feeling is
I doubt that it is China
or Russia or France.

2402
01:56:26.333 --> 01:56:29.233
But if it is.
that's the way it is.

2403
01:56:29.267 --> 01:56:33.700
I just think technologically
they're not that far ahead
of us.

2404
01:56:33.733 --> 01:56:36.167
In fact. I don't think
they're ahead of us at all.

2405
01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:39.467
And so. where do you think
we go from here. senator?

2406
01:56:39.500 --> 01:56:42.733
I believe that we must
continue working on this.

2407
01:56:43.233 --> 01:56:44.767
We. uh...

2408
01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:48.900
We don't know what they are.

2409
01:56:48.933 --> 01:56:52.733
But for us. now we have
to walk away from
with this slim report.

2410
01:56:52.767 --> 01:56:55.167
It would not be
in keeping with.

2411
01:56:55.200 --> 01:56:57.433
what i believe is good
scientific evidence.

2412
01:56:57.467 --> 01:56:58.800
We need to continue...

2413
01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:01.600
not worried about...

2414
01:57:01.633 --> 01:57:04.067
conspiracy theories
and little green men.

2415
01:57:04.067 --> 01:57:06.067
We have to worry
about... science.

2416
01:57:06.100 --> 01:57:08.333
What are they?
We know they exist.

2417
01:57:08.367 --> 01:57:10.167
So. let's continue working...

2418
01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:12.200
scientifically to figure out
what the hell they are.

2419
01:57:12.733 --> 01:57:13.600
Absolutely.

2420
01:57:13.633 --> 01:57:15.233
Senator. a pleasure
speaking with you.

2421
01:57:15.267 --> 01:57:16.633
Thanks very much
for your time.

2422
01:57:17.133 --> 01:57:17.867
My pleasure.

2423
01:57:19.433 --> 01:57:21.900
Well. great to get
Senator Reid's input.

2424
01:57:21.933 --> 01:57:23.600
and if nothing else.
the Pentagon report

2425
01:57:23.633 --> 01:57:25.833
has formalized
a number of goals

2426
01:57:25.867 --> 01:57:28.467
for future UAP Research.

2427
01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:31.067
The Pentagon says they plan
to standardize the reporting.

2428
01:57:31.067 --> 01:57:33.900
consolidate the data
and deepen the analysis.

2429
01:57:33.933 --> 01:57:36.600
They intend to expand
their collection of data.

2430
01:57:36.633 --> 01:57:40.067
and increase the investments
in Research and Development.

2431
01:57:40.067 --> 01:57:41.967
Okay. So. Jim.
let me start with you.

2432
01:57:42.067 --> 01:57:42.900
Do you think that's true?

2433
01:57:42.933 --> 01:57:44.933
Do you think that
Congress will continue

2434
01:57:44.967 --> 01:57:47.433
funding UAP Research
like the report says?

2435
01:57:47.467 --> 01:57:49.500
Oh. yeah. I think the
cat's out of the bag.

2436
01:57:49.533 --> 01:57:52.833
and as long as UAPs are
buzzing nuclear sites.

2437
01:57:52.867 --> 01:57:57.067
military installations and
carrier strike groups.

2438
01:57:57.100 --> 01:57:59.367
you're going to have
money for research.

2439
01:57:59.400 --> 01:58:00.700
So you think this is just
the beginning of this?

2440
01:58:00.733 --> 01:58:02.300
I think this is just
the beginning. yes.

2441
01:58:02.333 --> 01:58:03.567
Okay. so...

2442
01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:04.833
Time has come.
moment of truth.

2443
01:58:04.867 --> 01:58:06.667
everybody here on the panel.

2444
01:58:06.700 --> 01:58:07.967
one of you is an alien.

2445
01:58:08.067 --> 01:58:09.967
No. that's not what
we're talking about.

2446
01:58:10.067 --> 01:58:11.633
Given what we
have learned tonight.

2447
01:58:11.667 --> 01:58:15.100
Experts. I can't wait to
hear your take in all of this.

2448
01:58:15.133 --> 01:58:20.200
Do you believe that these UAPs
are extraterrestrials?

2449
01:58:20.233 --> 01:58:21.933
Do you believe that
they're adversaries.

2450
01:58:21.967 --> 01:58:24.767
foreign players of some kind
or something else entirely?

2451
01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:26.167
We'll start with my
good friend. Nick Pope.

2452
01:58:26.200 --> 01:58:27.133
What do you think man?

2453
01:58:27.167 --> 01:58:28.833
I'd love it to be aliens.

2454
01:58:28.867 --> 01:58:30.100
But i occasionally wonder.

2455
01:58:30.133 --> 01:58:31.567
if it isn't something
more bizarre.

2456
01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:34.833
something for which we have
neither the words nor concept.

2457
01:58:34.867 --> 01:58:37.733
So. uh. you think it could be
something else entirely?

2458
01:58:37.767 --> 01:58:38.667
Absolutely.

2459
01:58:38.700 --> 01:58:39.967
Alright.
Jim. what about you?

2460
01:58:40.933 --> 01:58:43.567
I believe it's a
non-human technology.

2461
01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:46.233
-Really?
-And I wish
I knew who owns it.

2462
01:58:46.267 --> 01:58:48.933
Wow. that's incredible to hear
from you.

2463
01:58:48.967 --> 01:58:51.700
You know. our intelligence
clandestine guy here.

2464
01:58:51.733 --> 01:58:53.900
I mean. that's kind
of remarkable.

2465
01:58:53.933 --> 01:58:55.067
shocking for me to hear.

2466
01:58:55.067 --> 01:58:56.800
-but that's what you believe.
-Yes.

2467
01:58:56.833 --> 01:58:57.700
That it's something other?

2468
01:58:57.733 --> 01:58:59.500
It's something other.
no question.

2469
01:58:59.533 --> 01:59:01.833
And you. my good man.
what do you think. George?

2470
01:59:01.867 --> 01:59:03.133
Well. given that
their technology.

2471
01:59:03.167 --> 01:59:05.833
that advanced technology
that is still far beyond.

2472
01:59:05.867 --> 01:59:08.567
what we can do for. has been
around at least 74 years.

2473
01:59:08.600 --> 01:59:10.167
I believe that
it is non-human.

2474
01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:11.400
that could be
non-human source.

2475
01:59:11.433 --> 01:59:13.100
that could mean
extra-terrestrial.

2476
01:59:13.133 --> 01:59:14.733
it could mean
inter-dimensional

2477
01:59:14.767 --> 01:59:16.200
it could mean
something more exotic.

2478
01:59:16.233 --> 01:59:18.600
ultra-terrestrial.
something as Nick said.

2479
01:59:18.633 --> 01:59:20.300
we don't know how to explain

2480
01:59:20.333 --> 01:59:22.400
but something lived here
for a long time.

2481
01:59:22.433 --> 01:59:24.167
We need to investigate
the unexplained.

2482
01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:25.567
not explain
the uninvestigated.

2483
01:59:25.600 --> 01:59:27.667
and that's gonna take
a permanent program.

2484
01:59:27.700 --> 01:59:29.200
Alright. we're going
to need another special

2485
01:59:29.233 --> 01:59:31.333
to talk about
ultra-terrestrials.

2486
01:59:31.367 --> 01:59:33.100
Im-- I'm-- Okay. good.

2487
01:59:33.133 --> 01:59:34.933
And that brings me
to you. Jeremy.

2488
01:59:34.967 --> 01:59:36.067
What do you think
about all this?

2489
01:59:36.067 --> 01:59:37.433
What's your
final analysis here?

2490
01:59:37.467 --> 01:59:39.900
Some UFOs
represents a technology

2491
01:59:39.933 --> 01:59:45.167
that outperform. outmaneuver.
and outpace our greatest
war planes and weaponry.

2492
01:59:45.200 --> 01:59:48.900
Some UFOs are not made
by modern humans.

2493
01:59:48.933 --> 01:59:50.833
And the United States
Government.

2494
01:59:50.867 --> 01:59:52.600
has in their possession...

2495
01:59:52.633 --> 01:59:53.667
some of these craft.

2496
01:59:54.633 --> 01:59:55.933
You believe that for sure?

2497
01:59:55.967 --> 01:59:57.133
I am certain of it.

2498
01:59:57.167 --> 01:59:59.367
Okay. let's go over
.to the big wall.

2499
01:59:59.400 --> 02:00:01.700
Jessica Chobot. what do you
make of all this?

2500
02:00:01.733 --> 02:00:04.200
Well. I'm not a scientist
so I have no problem.

2501
02:00:04.233 --> 02:00:06.000
just going into the deep
end of the pool.

2502
02:00:06.033 --> 02:00:06.800
Full alien.

2503
02:00:06.833 --> 02:00:08.400
I know it. Jess.
you're a believer.

2504
02:00:08.433 --> 02:00:09.867
-You're a true believer.
-Let's do this.

2505
02:00:09.900 --> 02:00:11.067
Let's do this. people.

2506
02:00:11.100 --> 02:00:13.100
Alright and standing next
to the true believer.

2507
02:00:13.133 --> 02:00:15.167
the voice of science. Dr. O.
what do you think?

2508
02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:16.833
Are you going to bring us
down to Earth here?

2509
02:00:16.867 --> 02:00:18.867
Oh. I think it's all
in the name.

2510
02:00:18.900 --> 02:00:21.333
whether you call it
a UAP or a UFO.

2511
02:00:21.367 --> 02:00:23.967
it starts with U.
which stands for Unknown.

2512
02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:25.367
and that's where I stand.

2513
02:00:25.400 --> 02:00:27.200
And. so I think
we need more data.

2514
02:00:27.233 --> 02:00:29.067
Do you think there
is a possibility that

2515
02:00:29.100 --> 02:00:32.000
there is an extra-terrestrial
explanation for this?

2516
02:00:32.033 --> 02:00:35.900
I don't lean that direction
for this phenomenon.

2517
02:00:35.933 --> 02:00:39.367
but there are astrophysicists
who think there may be life

2518
02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:41.767
on our planet that we don't
even recognize as life

2519
02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:43.933
because we don't have
a broad enough definition.

2520
02:00:43.967 --> 02:00:46.533
So. I do think that
the evidence

2521
02:00:46.567 --> 02:00:48.400
tells us that life
is ubiquitous

2522
02:00:48.433 --> 02:00:49.700
throughout our universe.

2523
02:00:49.733 --> 02:00:53.067
but I think that intelligent.
technologically advanced life

2524
02:00:53.100 --> 02:00:54.900
is exceedingly rare.

2525
02:00:54.933 --> 02:00:57.567
Alright so. one of the
things we have about

2526
02:00:57.600 --> 02:00:59.800
in this report is
what's not in it.

2527
02:00:59.833 --> 02:01:02.533
Right? There is a classified
version of this report.

2528
02:01:05.500 --> 02:01:08.067
Do you think we're going
to see more of this?

2529
02:01:08.067 --> 02:01:10.867
Do you think there's going
to be additional material?
declassified here?

2530
02:01:13.067 --> 02:01:14.067
Oh. there's certainly going
to be more material.

2531
02:01:14.067 --> 02:01:15.100
George and i are going to make
sure of that.

2532
02:01:15.133 --> 02:01:16.800
Oh. there's certainly going
to be more material.

2533
02:01:16.833 --> 02:01:18.533
George and I are going
to make sure of that.

2534
02:01:18.567 --> 02:01:21.067
Whether It's released
officially or not.
we don't know.

2535
02:01:21.067 --> 02:01:22.433
But it's coming.

2536
02:01:22.467 --> 02:01:26.133
And do you think that
what wasn't included
in this public report is.

2537
02:01:26.167 --> 02:01:28.833
for lack of a better word.
juicy. Nick?

2538
02:01:28.867 --> 02:01:32.200
I'm sure. I believe there will
be a lot of
technological information.

2539
02:01:32.233 --> 02:01:36.967
For example. about
the satellite imagery from
DNI John Radcliffe mentioned.

2540
02:01:37.067 --> 02:01:38.467
So. that's something
to look for.

2541
02:01:38.500 --> 02:01:41.633
But for sure this is the
beginning of a journey here.
this report.

2542
02:01:41.667 --> 02:01:43.867
This is not then end
of the conversation.

2543
02:01:43.900 --> 02:01:47.067
We've been told UFOs are real
and they require study.

2544
02:01:47.067 --> 02:01:48.367
That's what that report says.

2545
02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:50.467
All right. so much more
to come.

2546
02:01:50.500 --> 02:01:51.933
Yes.

2547
02:01:51.967 --> 02:01:55.867
I have to thAnk all of you.
What an absolutely amazing
journey tonight.

2548
02:01:55.900 --> 02:02:00.633
What a panel. To some.
this report represents
an awakening.

2549
02:02:00.667 --> 02:02:05.800
The government finally
addressing these UAPs that
have been around for years.

2550
02:02:05.833 --> 02:02:10.500
And this represents
a commitment to more research
and investigation. a new day.

2551
02:02:10.533 --> 02:02:14.067
To others the report is a good
first step. let's call it.

2552
02:02:14.100 --> 02:02:17.867
but that more transparency
is needed
to understand the truth.

2553
02:02:17.900 --> 02:02:21.800
And I'm sure that others still
will remain firmly skeptical.

2554
02:02:21.833 --> 02:02:25.167
I know we've got
some skeptics tonight
who are probably unmoved

2555
02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:28.467
by these
143 unexplained events.

2556
02:02:28.500 --> 02:02:31.667
As for me personally.
I just wish we had more time

2557
02:02:31.700 --> 02:02:33.700
because I have
a lot more questions.

2558
02:02:33.733 --> 02:02:36.933
I want to thank Jessica Chobot
and all of our esteemed guests

2559
02:02:36.967 --> 02:02:39.567
this evening for what has been
an amazing conversation.

2560
02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:42.667
For UFOs Declassified: LIVE.
I'm Josh Gates.

2561
02:02:42.700 --> 02:02:44.433
Good night from Las Vegas.
