00:00:53.875 --> 00:00:54.875
[sighs]

4
00:01:08.625 --> 00:01:09.625
Romeo?

5
00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:12.375
[grunts]

6
00:01:15.667 --> 00:01:17.333
[grunting]

7
00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:18.833
[sighs]

8
00:01:21.833 --> 00:01:23.917
[moaning]

9
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.125
To gaze upon you is like
drinking from the purest fountain.

10
00:01:27.208 --> 00:01:28.208
[sighs]

11
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.250
The fairest stars in heaven
do entreat your eyes.

12
00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:34.333
Oh. Romeo.

13
00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:40.375
Forswear it. sight.
I never saw true beauty until this night.

14
00:01:43.083 --> 00:01:44.833
Uh. Romeo?

15
00:01:44.917 --> 00:01:45.917
Yes. my love?

16
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.500
Why are you talking like that?

17
00:01:49.208 --> 00:01:53.000
Oh. um-- I-- I--
I felt like it sounded romantic.

18
00:01:53.542 --> 00:01:54.792
-Oh.
-Don't you like it?

19
00:01:54.875 --> 00:01:57.458
Um-- Yeah. actually. It's kinda nice.

20
00:01:58.083 --> 00:02:00.750
Then by yonder blessed moon. I vow.
I shall speaketh--

21
00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:03.875
-[yelling] Oh! Okay!
-Uh-- Oh! Oh! [stammers]

22
00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.458
-Are you okay?
-I-- No.

23
00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:06.542
-Um…
-Okay.

24
00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:10.750
[grunting. panting]

25
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.125
-I'm okay. I'm okay. Yeah.
-[gasps] Nice.

26
00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:15.708
-God. I missed you.
-I missed you too.

27
00:02:15.792 --> 00:02:17.583
You're the most beautiful woman
in all of Verona.

28
00:02:17.667 --> 00:02:19.458
-Yes. keep talking.
-We're the most perfect pair.

29
00:02:19.542 --> 00:02:20.375
Yes. don't stop.

30
00:02:20.458 --> 00:02:22.458
They will be saying our names
for centuries.

31
00:02:22.542 --> 00:02:24.042
-Oh. what will they say?
-They will say.

32
00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:28.292
"Never were two hearts more destined
to entwine than those of the lovers…"

33
00:02:28.375 --> 00:02:30.417
-Yes. Yes.
-"…Romeo and--"

34
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.542
[father] Rosaline?

35
00:02:32.625 --> 00:02:33.708
-Shit.
-What do we do?

36
00:02:33.792 --> 00:02:35.083
-My father.
-I don't know what to do.

37
00:02:35.167 --> 00:02:36.333
-You need to go. Hide.
-Right.

38
00:02:36.417 --> 00:02:38.792
-Um. [sighs] Um.
-Uh… Oh.

39
00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:40.917
[father] Rosaline!

40
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
[sighs] Father?

41
00:02:46.542 --> 00:02:48.167
I thought I heard voices.

42
00:02:49.833 --> 00:02:52.875
Oh. [sighs] I was. uh--
I was in the commode.

43
00:02:54.458 --> 00:02:55.583
Talking to yourself?

44
00:02:56.292 --> 00:02:57.292
It helps.

45
00:02:58.542 --> 00:03:00.375
Huh. I have the opposite problem--

46
00:03:01.083 --> 00:03:04.750
[pants. sighs] Sorry. Where were we?

47
00:03:05.292 --> 00:03:06.708
[breathing heavily]

48
00:03:07.333 --> 00:03:08.333
Um…

49
00:03:09.333 --> 00:03:12.208
For I-- Oh.
they were saying our names for centuries.

50
00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:14.833
Except. how can
they say our names for centuries if--

51
00:03:15.375 --> 00:03:17.208
If-- If-- Um. what?

52
00:03:18.583 --> 00:03:20.708
If we'll always be a secret?

53
00:03:21.208 --> 00:03:23.125
We won't. We won't always be a secret.

54
00:03:23.208 --> 00:03:26.042
[sighs] You're a Montague. I'm a Capulet.

55
00:03:26.125 --> 00:03:28.458
Our families have been enemies
for generations.

56
00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:32.458
Rosaline. we will make this work.
I promise.

57
00:03:32.542 --> 00:03:36.958
One day. we will be together forever.

58
00:03:37.042 --> 00:03:38.125
Forever.

59
00:03:40.083 --> 00:03:41.375
[kisses]

60
00:03:41.458 --> 00:03:43.542
-Good night. Romeo.
-Good night. Rosaline.

61
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.917
A thousand times good night. [chuckles]

62
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.958
[Romeo] Nice one!

63
00:03:53.458 --> 00:03:55.583
Romeo and Rosaline.

64
00:03:57.667 --> 00:03:58.667
Hmm.

65
00:04:00.208 --> 00:04:01.625
Does have a nice ring to it.

66
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.417
-[nurse] Rise and shine. love!
-[groans] Romeo.

67
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Oh. another late night. was it?

68
00:04:18.083 --> 00:04:19.792
Oh. bloody hell.

69
00:04:20.292 --> 00:04:21.917
Are you trying to ruin me?

70
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.375
I thought you were cool
with my sneaking around.

71
00:04:24.458 --> 00:04:28.000
Sneaking around? Yes. Getting caught? No.

72
00:04:28.083 --> 00:04:30.875
Cover your tracks. woman. please.

73
00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:31.958
Sorry.

74
00:04:33.083 --> 00:04:34.750
Although… [groans]

75
00:04:34.833 --> 00:04:38.167
If I could date who I wanted to date.
read what I wanted to read.

76
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.083
there wouldn't be so much sneaking around
in the first place.

77
00:04:41.167 --> 00:04:42.167
Would there. Nurse?

78
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.167
So unfair.

79
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.292
Right. well.
I went to nursing school for seven years.

80
00:04:46.375 --> 00:04:47.750
and now this is what I do for a living.

81
00:04:47.833 --> 00:04:49.417
So. yeah. life is unfair.

82
00:04:50.458 --> 00:04:52.250
By the way. that's what I call covert.

83
00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:53.333
[gasps]

84
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.708
Oh. my God.

85
00:04:56.208 --> 00:04:57.750
[gasps] Nurse.

86
00:04:57.833 --> 00:05:00.792
Right. let's get you dressed.
You have lunch at noon.

87
00:05:00.875 --> 00:05:03.417
Noon? Then why did you wake me so early?

88
00:05:04.292 --> 00:05:08.000
[groans] 'Cause your dad wants you
to wear this behemoth again.

89
00:05:10.542 --> 00:05:11.583
[groans]

90
00:05:11.667 --> 00:05:13.667
No. get up. you lazy cow. Come on.

91
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.375
You can't live in this house forever.
Rosaline.

92
00:05:16.458 --> 00:05:20.167
Your sisters are all off and married.
and now it's your turn.

93
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.583
I'm too young to get married.

94
00:05:21.667 --> 00:05:22.958
-Too young?
-Yeah.

95
00:05:23.042 --> 00:05:24.042
Look at you.

96
00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:25.875
You're almost too old.

97
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.542
Your mother had three kids
when she was your age.

98
00:05:29.625 --> 00:05:31.333
And don't you think she wanted more.
Father?

99
00:05:31.417 --> 00:05:34.083
Of course she did. That's why we had you.

100
00:05:35.792 --> 00:05:38.958
[old suitor]
So. your father's told me all about you.

101
00:05:39.042 --> 00:05:43.000
He even said that you wanted a career.
Is that right?

102
00:05:43.083 --> 00:05:45.167
Yeah. I intend to be a cartographer.

103
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.167
A cartographer? [laughs]

104
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.292
That-- That's adorable.

105
00:05:51.792 --> 00:05:55.042
[stammers]
My third wife had an ambition once.

106
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.250
Didn't care for it on her.

107
00:05:57.333 --> 00:05:58.458
Mother of God.

108
00:05:58.542 --> 00:06:01.500
But she wasn't as pretty as you are.
[slurps]

109
00:06:02.792 --> 00:06:03.792
You know--

110
00:06:04.375 --> 00:06:05.375
[slurps]

111
00:06:05.458 --> 00:06:09.292
If my father told you so much about me.
Mr. Danieli…

112
00:06:11.167 --> 00:06:13.042
…he must have mentioned Josephine.

113
00:06:13.542 --> 00:06:15.000
Wherever I go. she goes.

114
00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:17.125
-Oh.
-[Rosaline] Yeah.

115
00:06:17.625 --> 00:06:21.250
Well-- Well.
when do I get to meet this Josephine?

116
00:06:21.333 --> 00:06:22.333
What do you mean?

117
00:06:23.417 --> 00:06:24.875
She's sitting right there.

118
00:06:28.875 --> 00:06:31.500
Josephine! No!
Take that out of your mouth right now!

119
00:06:31.583 --> 00:06:34.333
Take it! Put it down!
We've been over this!

120
00:06:39.083 --> 00:06:41.042
[Mr. Danieli breathing heavily]

121
00:06:41.583 --> 00:06:42.750
[sighs]

122
00:06:44.333 --> 00:06:47.625
Just… wasn't into me. I guess.

123
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.333
Ah. that's right.
You wanna marry for love.

124
00:06:54.417 --> 00:06:55.750
Is there any other reason?

125
00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:01.125
Mmm. Money. status. land.
nicer living quarters.

126
00:07:01.708 --> 00:07:03.250
No. no other reason.

127
00:07:03.333 --> 00:07:04.333
[street chatter]

128
00:07:04.417 --> 00:07:05.833
We get one life. Paris.

129
00:07:06.333 --> 00:07:11.500
I want mine to be different.
I want romance. passion. adventure.

130
00:07:11.583 --> 00:07:12.708
Mm-hmm.

131
00:07:13.417 --> 00:07:15.417
And this mystery boy. he gives you that?

132
00:07:16.292 --> 00:07:18.125
Mm-hmm.

133
00:07:18.625 --> 00:07:19.625
What?

134
00:07:19.708 --> 00:07:23.500
I just wonder if all this sneaking around
is adding to the attraction.

135
00:07:23.583 --> 00:07:25.083
Because. in my experience.

136
00:07:25.167 --> 00:07:29.000
I've often found that it's pretty easy
to mistake danger and drama

137
00:07:29.083 --> 00:07:30.750
for romantic passion.

138
00:07:30.833 --> 00:07:33.250
But also. I mean.
who doesn't love a secret?

139
00:07:33.333 --> 00:07:35.958
To live in a world of your own making.
just the two of you.

140
00:07:36.042 --> 00:07:41.250
[continues speaking indistinctly]

141
00:07:47.875 --> 00:07:49.750
Uh-- Okay.

142
00:07:49.833 --> 00:07:51.542
[pedestrian] Romeo! Hey. man.

143
00:07:52.292 --> 00:07:53.292
Come on.

144
00:08:14.667 --> 00:08:16.292
Stand back. coz!

145
00:08:17.292 --> 00:08:18.208
[groans]

146
00:08:18.292 --> 00:08:21.792
You're surrounded by Montagues.

147
00:08:21.875 --> 00:08:25.208
You might catch something.

148
00:08:25.292 --> 00:08:26.583
They weren't even doing anything.

149
00:08:26.667 --> 00:08:28.917
Not yet. they weren't.

150
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.042
We don't want any trouble. Tybalt.

151
00:08:31.125 --> 00:08:35.042
[slurred] "Oh. we don't want any trouble.
Tybalt." [laughs]

152
00:08:35.125 --> 00:08:39.000
Then. you should go back to
your side of town where you belong.

153
00:08:39.083 --> 00:08:41.708
Why don't you and your. uh.
boy band meet us there?

154
00:08:41.792 --> 00:08:43.083
Maybe we will.

155
00:08:43.667 --> 00:08:45.000
You're welcome there any time.

156
00:08:45.083 --> 00:08:48.708
How about I welcome my fist to your face?

157
00:08:49.208 --> 00:08:53.917
I don't know what that means.

158
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.417
It means I'm going to punch you!

159
00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.667
-[both grunting]
-[people on street] Oh! Whoa!

160
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:06.792
[both grunting]

161
00:09:06.875 --> 00:09:09.833
-Ho! Oh. oh. oh! [breathes heavily]
-Okay. Okay. All right. All right.

162
00:09:09.917 --> 00:09:12.167
You all have big swords.

163
00:09:12.667 --> 00:09:15.167
How about putting them
back in your pants now. yeah?

164
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:16.583
Come on. Let's go.

165
00:09:19.583 --> 00:09:23.167
-[sighs]
-[Romeo] Benvolio. Mercutio. let's go.

166
00:09:24.167 --> 00:09:27.833
Girl. that is one tasty Montague.

167
00:09:27.917 --> 00:09:29.250
Can I tell you a secret?

168
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:34.792
[moaning. kissing]

169
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.042
[chuckles]

170
00:09:38.375 --> 00:09:39.417
[sighs]

171
00:09:42.125 --> 00:09:43.292
For you.

172
00:09:43.375 --> 00:09:44.375
[gasps]

173
00:09:45.208 --> 00:09:46.667
[Romeo] I engraved it myself.

174
00:09:47.167 --> 00:09:48.792
[Rosaline gasps. sighs]

175
00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.708
I shall wear it always.

176
00:09:52.333 --> 00:09:53.333
Okay.

177
00:09:55.083 --> 00:09:56.083

00:09:58.875 --> 00:09:59.958
-[sighs]
-[chuckles]

179
00:10:01.417 --> 00:10:03.208
I'm sorry about my cousin.

180
00:10:03.292 --> 00:10:04.500
Oh. well. you know…

181
00:10:04.583 --> 00:10:07.167
I just wish we could live far.
far away from here.

182
00:10:07.792 --> 00:10:09.000
Where would we live?

183
00:10:09.083 --> 00:10:10.375
On a mountaintop.

184
00:10:10.458 --> 00:10:11.333
In a cabin.

185
00:10:11.417 --> 00:10:12.542
-Made of wood.
-[sighs]

186
00:10:12.625 --> 00:10:15.500
Kinda sounds perfect.
I could write poetry all day.

187
00:10:15.583 --> 00:10:17.375
Oh. you'll be such a gifted poet.

188
00:10:17.458 --> 00:10:19.500
You could keep the house
and watch the children.

189
00:10:19.583 --> 00:10:20.583
Yes.

190
00:10:22.458 --> 00:10:23.792
Wait. What?

191
00:10:23.875 --> 00:10:25.167
-Hmm?
-[chuckles]

192
00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:30.750
Uh. sorry. While you're off writing verse.
I'm home changing diapers?

193
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:34.750
[stammers] Well.
the point is that we would be together…

194
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:41.250
in public. away from our families
and-and-and all of this hate.

195
00:10:43.167 --> 00:10:44.750
-Right.
-Yeah.

196
00:10:44.833 --> 00:10:45.958
-Right.
-Yeah. [chuckles]

197
00:10:46.042 --> 00:10:48.417
Yes. Okay. Okay. [chuckles]

198
00:10:50.292 --> 00:10:51.333
I love you.

199
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:59.250
Do you love me too?

200
00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.667
-Oh.
-It's just--

201
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:06.583
-Fine.
-Sorry.

202
00:11:06.667 --> 00:11:09.375
I-- I-- I wasn't expecting that.
It's just no one's ever really…

203
00:11:09.458 --> 00:11:11.125
I should probably go. Um--

204
00:11:11.208 --> 00:11:15.958
I-- I. um-- There's the guards. like.
everywhere tonight. so it's not safe.

205
00:11:16.042 --> 00:11:16.875
No. [stammers]

206
00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:20.292
I'm just-- Just get going
so I don't get captured by the guards.

207
00:11:20.375 --> 00:11:23.500
Romeo. wait. The Capulet Ball is tomorrow.

208
00:11:23.583 --> 00:11:26.167
Rosaline. you know
I can't be seen at any Capulet ga--

209
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.833
It's a masquerade ball.

210
00:11:29.375 --> 00:11:32.917
We could dance together.
and no one will know that it's us.

211
00:11:36.542 --> 00:11:37.542
I'll be there.

212
00:11:38.458 --> 00:11:40.333
Great. I can't wait.

213
00:11:41.833 --> 00:11:44.500
A thousand times can't wait? [chuckles]

214
00:11:45.542 --> 00:11:47.792
[Rosaline] I've been waiting for him to
say those words.

215
00:11:47.875 --> 00:11:51.417
And then he finally does.
and I just freeze like an idiot.

216
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:53.833
I don't know what's wrong with me. Nurse.

217
00:11:53.917 --> 00:11:55.708
There's nothing wrong with you. chicken.

218
00:11:55.792 --> 00:11:59.625
They're not easy words to say.
You know. unless you mean them.

219
00:12:00.125 --> 00:12:01.625
I-- Of course I mean them.

220
00:12:01.708 --> 00:12:03.375
-That beak all right?
-Yes.

221
00:12:04.167 --> 00:12:05.542
[sighs] It's okay.

222
00:12:06.083 --> 00:12:07.750
Tonight. I'll make it up to him.

223
00:12:07.833 --> 00:12:09.958
We'll dance. We'll sing. We'll kiss.

224
00:12:10.042 --> 00:12:11.750
Everything will be back to normal.

225
00:12:11.833 --> 00:12:13.500
I have wonderful news.

226
00:12:13.583 --> 00:12:17.292
Just when we thought we had run out of
eligible bachelors in Verona.

227
00:12:17.375 --> 00:12:19.792
a family has arrived from the north.

228
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.750
The Penzas.

229
00:12:21.833 --> 00:12:27.542
And lucky for us. they have a son
who has just returned from the war intact.

230
00:12:28.083 --> 00:12:30.125
Wonderful! You marry him.

231
00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:31.917
[knocking]

232
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.250
That must be him.

233
00:12:34.125 --> 00:12:35.125
Wait.

234
00:12:35.208 --> 00:12:36.958
-[stammers] Now?
-Now.

235
00:12:37.042 --> 00:12:38.708
[Rosaline]
I'd rather eat rotten goat innards!

236
00:12:38.792 --> 00:12:40.667
[father] I have
a really good feeling. No. Rosaline.

237
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.708
[Rosaline] I'd rather bathe in the filth
of ten thousand mules.

238
00:12:42.792 --> 00:12:44.833
-[father] Just give him a chance.
-[Rosaline] No.

239
00:12:44.917 --> 00:12:45.917
[father] Rosaline.

240
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
[Rosaline] How many times
do I have to tell you. Father?

241
00:12:48.083 --> 00:12:50.333
I don't want an arranged marriage.

242
00:12:50.417 --> 00:12:55.000
I wanna travel the world.
be free. have adventures.

243
00:12:55.083 --> 00:12:57.208
and with someone that I actually love.

244
00:12:57.292 --> 00:12:58.625
[father] You're a woman.

245
00:12:58.708 --> 00:13:01.083
You're not supposed to talk about
what you want.

246
00:13:03.833 --> 00:13:04.833
[grunts]

247
00:13:05.708 --> 00:13:11.167
Dario Penza. may I present to you
my beautiful daughter. Rosaline.

248
00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:14.000
[clicks tongue. sighs]

249
00:13:14.542 --> 00:13:15.667
Hello.

250
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:18.000
[scoffs] Whatever.

251
00:13:18.083 --> 00:13:19.083
Have a good time.

252
00:13:26.125 --> 00:13:27.458
Shall we? [sighs]

253
00:13:30.292 --> 00:13:31.292
[sighs]

254
00:13:35.875 --> 00:13:37.292
[sighs]

255
00:13:37.375 --> 00:13:40.875
-So. how do you like living in Ver--
-Let me stop you right there. soldier boy.

256
00:13:41.375 --> 00:13:42.375
-Soldier boy?
-Now. granted.

257
00:13:42.458 --> 00:13:45.583
you are a big step up
from the toothless octogenarians

258
00:13:45.667 --> 00:13:47.833
my father usually tries to pawn me off on…

259
00:13:49.833 --> 00:13:51.958
but the fact remains:

260
00:13:52.042 --> 00:13:55.958
I have literally no interest in you or in
this whole arranged marriage business.

261
00:13:56.042 --> 00:13:57.500
No matter how many acres of land

262
00:13:57.583 --> 00:13:59.583
or special breed of horse
your father's offering.

263
00:13:59.667 --> 00:14:00.625
Cow.

264
00:14:00.708 --> 00:14:01.708
Excuse me?

265
00:14:01.792 --> 00:14:03.292
He's offering a cow.

266
00:14:03.375 --> 00:14:05.292
That's about it. I'm afraid.
We're not rich.

267
00:14:05.375 --> 00:14:06.625
Well. whoop-de-do.

268
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.708
-[Dario] If I was you. I'd take the deal.
-[Rosaline] Would you?

269
00:14:09.792 --> 00:14:12.958
Yeah. [chuckles]
I have some land. some prospects.

270
00:14:13.542 --> 00:14:15.042
I have all my teeth.

271
00:14:15.625 --> 00:14:16.917
Could do a lot worse.

272
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.042
Well. you're not really my type.

273
00:14:19.125 --> 00:14:20.333
You're not exactly my type either.

274
00:14:20.417 --> 00:14:22.417
Hmm. And what is your type. Suede City?

275
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.500
Oh. my type is not a shrew.

276
00:14:25.083 --> 00:14:25.958
Blow me.

277
00:14:27.042 --> 00:14:28.042
[wheels squeak]

278
00:14:28.125 --> 00:14:31.333
[clears throat] Well. we're here.

279
00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:36.042
Um. what's this now?

280
00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:39.958
Yeah. she's a beaut. isn't she?

281
00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.167
[chuckles] Yeah. that's not happening.

282
00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:45.750
And why is that?

283
00:14:47.708 --> 00:14:49.292
I have-- [stammers]

284
00:14:49.375 --> 00:14:51.875
There's-- It's--
It doesn't look safe. Mmm.

285
00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:55.500
I was master helmsman of a six-sail
carrack. I assure you she's plenty safe.

286
00:14:55.583 --> 00:14:56.875
What if there's a storm?

287
00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.417
Do you see any storm clouds?

288
00:14:58.917 --> 00:15:02.583
What if I have to go to the bathroom. hmm?

289
00:15:06.458 --> 00:15:08.917
-[huffs]
-Oh. Oh. I see.

290
00:15:09.458 --> 00:15:11.458
-What do you see?
-[chuckles] No. you're afraid.

291
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.750
[chuckles] What?

292
00:15:13.833 --> 00:15:15.542
-No. I'm not.
-I can see it in your face.

293
00:15:15.625 --> 00:15:17.125
No. I am not.

294
00:15:17.208 --> 00:15:19.958
Look at the big tough girl
afraid of the water.

295
00:15:20.042 --> 00:15:22.333
I am not afraid of the [imitates] "water."

296
00:15:22.417 --> 00:15:23.375
That's ridiculous.

297
00:15:24.875 --> 00:15:26.000
[Rosaline scoffs]

298
00:15:27.458 --> 00:15:29.042
[quietly] I'm afraid of the fish.

299
00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:32.375
-All of them?
-[Rosaline] Yeah. it's a real thing.

300
00:15:32.458 --> 00:15:33.917
Ichthyophobia. Look it up.

301
00:15:34.417 --> 00:15:36.583
-All fish?
-[Rosaline] Okay. that's good.

302
00:15:36.667 --> 00:15:38.917
-Oh. this must be a nightmare for you.
-All right. fine. I'll go.

303
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.708
I'll go on your stupid boat.

304
00:15:41.208 --> 00:15:42.042
Fantastic.

305
00:15:42.125 --> 00:15:44.917
[Rosaline] I have somewhere I have to be.
So. 30 minutes max.

306
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.167
-Would you like a hand?
-No!

307
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:48.833
Okay. Watch out for the-- Sorry.

308
00:15:50.375 --> 00:15:51.375
You got it.

309
00:15:57.708 --> 00:16:02.042
Okay. just-- Whoa. Whoa. Okay.

310
00:16:02.125 --> 00:16:03.292
This is gonna be fun.

311
00:16:03.375 --> 00:16:07.792
[Rosaline scoffs. pants]

312
00:16:07.875 --> 00:16:10.583
[pop song playing]

313

[people at ball chattering]

314
00:16:14.333 --> 00:16:15.333
[exhales sharply]

315
00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:27.750
Rosaline? No.

316
00:16:31.542 --> 00:16:32.542
Rosaline?

317
00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:35.750
Rosaline?

318
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.042
[pop song stops]

319
00:16:41.833 --> 00:16:43.417
[sighs]

320
00:16:50.375 --> 00:16:51.667
Lucky knife.

321
00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:53.083
Do you hunt?

322
00:16:54.417 --> 00:16:55.542
Yeah. I hunt.

323
00:16:55.625 --> 00:16:58.458
Huh. Yeah. I grew up on a farm
just north of here.

324
00:16:58.542 --> 00:17:02.625
Some chickens. some cows.
a very moody goat.

325
00:17:02.708 --> 00:17:03.542
Yeah.

326
00:17:03.625 --> 00:17:05.792
And my mum.
she taught me how to cook even before I--

327
00:17:05.875 --> 00:17:07.000
I have a boyfriend.

328
00:17:09.625 --> 00:17:10.625
You do?

329
00:17:11.833 --> 00:17:15.875
[sighs] Yeah.
and he's waiting for me right this minute.

330
00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:18.125
So we just really need to be
getting going and--

331
00:17:18.208 --> 00:17:20.500
Your father never mentioned any boyfriend.

332
00:17:22.458 --> 00:17:25.042
He doesn't know. [sighs]

333
00:17:25.125 --> 00:17:27.583
Well. you could've just told me that
in the first place.

334
00:17:27.667 --> 00:17:28.667
We'll get you back.

335
00:17:32.625 --> 00:17:34.208
[wind whistling]

336
00:17:34.292 --> 00:17:36.542
[thunder rumbles]

337
00:17:36.625 --> 00:17:38.083
[sighs] Uh-oh.

338
00:17:38.667 --> 00:17:39.667
Uh-oh?

339
00:17:40.625 --> 00:17:41.917

341
00:17:43.875 --> 00:17:44.875
What?

342
00:17:45.375 --> 00:17:46.375
Oh. my God.

343
00:17:46.458 --> 00:17:47.583
[sighs] What?

344
00:17:47.667 --> 00:17:49.333
We can't go back in this!

345
00:17:49.417 --> 00:17:50.833
We'll have to wait it out!

346
00:17:51.833 --> 00:17:54.000
But we must go back!

347
00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.833
-The ball started an hour ago!

00:18:08.042 --> 00:18:10.458
[Dario] You're getting drenched.
Come sit down.

353
00:18:10.542 --> 00:18:12.083
You said it wasn't gonna storm!

354
00:18:12.167 --> 00:18:14.208
I'm a soldier. not a weatherman.

355
00:18:15.292 --> 00:18:16.458
I hope you're happy.

356
00:18:16.542 --> 00:18:17.542
[Dario] I'm not.

[Rosaline pants]

358
00:18:19.583 --> 00:18:21.708
Stop smiling.

[groaning]

360
00:18:26.792 --> 00:18:28.708
[Dario] Yeah. we're going backwards.

[people at ball chattering]

363
00:18:33.708 --> 00:18:35.042
-Hey.
-Oh.

364
00:18:35.917 --> 00:18:38.833
Um. I'm so sorry--

365
00:18:38.917 --> 00:18:42.667
I. um. I'm-- No. all right.

366
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:43.875
Who was that?

367
00:18:45.542 --> 00:18:46.542
[sighs]

368
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:52.125
[sighs] Great.

369
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:56.500
-Oh!
-Oh. oh.

370
00:18:56.583 --> 00:18:58.792
-Oh. I'm so sorry.
-[stammers] Excuse me.

371
00:19:02.542 --> 00:19:04.292
My-- My bad.

372
00:19:05.917 --> 00:19:06.917
It's okay.

373
00:19:14.542 --> 00:19:17.042
H-Hi. I'm Romeo.

374
00:19:21.417 --> 00:19:22.917

376
00:19:31.875 --> 00:19:34.458
[Rosaline] This has literally been
the worst night of my life.

377
00:19:34.542 --> 00:19:36.750
-[Dario] The feeling's more than mutual.
-[sighs]

378
00:19:40.667 --> 00:19:41.667
Thanks for nothing.

379
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:43.167
Yeah. right there with you.

380
00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:46.833
Actually. the pancetta wasn't terrible.
so thank you for that. But only for that.

381
00:19:46.917 --> 00:19:49.667
Well. you're welcome for that.
But only for that.

382
00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:50.792
Have a nice life!

383

387
00:20:36.125 --> 00:20:37.125
Steve the Courier!

388
00:20:39.167 --> 00:20:40.167
What up?

389
00:20:41.458 --> 00:20:43.667
You did deliver my message this morning.
yes?

390
00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:46.625
Message.

391
00:20:47.333 --> 00:20:49.708
Uh. message.

392
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.250
Message.

393
00:20:53.333 --> 00:20:54.833
Oh. yeah. I-- I think so.

394
00:20:54.917 --> 00:20:56.167
Y-- You think so?

395
00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:57.250
[Steve] I. um--

396
00:21:01.167 --> 00:21:02.292
Steve!

397
00:21:02.375 --> 00:21:05.000
I definitely delivered all the mail.

398
00:21:07.417 --> 00:21:09.375
And there was nothing for me in return?

399
00:21:09.458 --> 00:21:11.708
[Steve] No. no.
Just some letters for your pops.

400
00:21:11.792 --> 00:21:12.917
[Rosaline] That's it?

401
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Yeah. that's it.

402
00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:16.042
[Rosaline] You're-- You're sure?

403
00:21:16.542 --> 00:21:17.625
Yeah. 100%.

404
00:21:20.792 --> 00:21:22.500
[Rosaline] You think he's angry with me?

405
00:21:22.583 --> 00:21:24.042
[nurse] I don't know why he would be.

406
00:21:24.125 --> 00:21:25.458
Do you think he's tired of me?

407
00:21:25.542 --> 00:21:26.958
I'm sure that's not it.

408
00:21:27.042 --> 00:21:28.375
Then why haven't I heard from him?

409
00:21:28.458 --> 00:21:31.292
[inhales deeply] Well.
there is a lot of plague going around.

410
00:21:31.375 --> 00:21:32.833
You think he has plague?

411
00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:35.625
He did look a bit boily.
But it's probably just hormones.

412
00:21:35.708 --> 00:21:37.208
-Oh. my God.
-Rosaline!

413
00:21:38.125 --> 00:21:40.750
Uh. your. um--

414
00:21:40.833 --> 00:21:41.833
Oh. she knows.

415
00:21:41.917 --> 00:21:45.250
Oh. Well. I saw Romeo crossing the bridge.
and he's headed this way.

[sighs. pants]

418
00:22:34.792 --> 00:22:36.208
Where the hell is he going?

[grunts] Whatever.

425
00:23:18.333 --> 00:23:20.875
It's fine. It's fine.

426
00:23:20.958 --> 00:23:22.167
[Romeo speaking indistinctly]

427
00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:24.292
[grunts]
It's not like he can't have friends.

428
00:23:24.375 --> 00:23:25.958
[panting]

429
00:23:26.042 --> 00:23:29.458
[Romeo] Thou art as glorious
as a winged messenger of heaven.

430
00:23:29.542 --> 00:23:31.708
[Rosaline] Except for whoever that is.

431
00:23:31.792 --> 00:23:35.417
The fairest stars in heaven
do entreat your eyes.

432
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:37.042
The fairest stars.

433
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.167
Forswear it. sight.
I never saw true beauty until this night.

434

435
00:23:46.125 --> 00:23:47.250
[nurse] Madam.

436
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:54.125
Nurse! Sweet Montague. be true.
Stay but a little. I will come again.

437
00:23:55.958 --> 00:23:56.958
[Romeo groans]

438
00:23:58.958 --> 00:23:59.958
[kisses]

440
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:05.542

["All By Myself" playing on violin]

443
00:24:41.708 --> 00:24:43.542
Not getting out of bed today either?

-[violin stops]
-[grunting]

445
00:24:47.917 --> 00:24:48.917
Stay out.

446
00:24:50.208 --> 00:24:52.000
Hey. I was listening to that.

447
00:24:52.083 --> 00:24:53.125
It was horrible.

448
00:24:53.208 --> 00:24:54.208
[sighs]

449
00:24:54.292 --> 00:24:56.208
How long is this gonna go on for?

450
00:24:56.292 --> 00:24:58.875
The sun is shining. The air is warm.

451
00:24:58.958 --> 00:25:00.792
A nice long ride will do you good.

452
00:25:00.875 --> 00:25:03.583
I'll call the stables
and have them saddle your horse.

453
00:25:03.667 --> 00:25:05.167
I can't ride the horse.

454
00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:06.375
[nurse] Why not?

455
00:25:06.458 --> 00:25:07.458
I have cholera.

456
00:25:07.542 --> 00:25:09.167
You do not have cholera.

457
00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:10.333
How do you know?

458
00:25:10.417 --> 00:25:13.083
Because I am a registered nurse.

459
00:25:13.167 --> 00:25:15.833
[groans] What's the point?

460
00:25:15.917 --> 00:25:19.333
The point is you can't
lie around in bed all afternoon. chicken.

461
00:25:21.333 --> 00:25:23.750
[scoffs] I'll never love again.

462
00:25:23.833 --> 00:25:26.417
[nurse] I think
you're being rather dramatic. Rosaline.

463
00:25:28.583 --> 00:25:31.583
Nurse. you don't understand.

464
00:25:32.167 --> 00:25:37.208
They were kissing. and-and-and touching.
and-and being all gross.

465
00:25:37.292 --> 00:25:41.375
And he was saying things to her
that he just said to me three days ago.

466
00:25:41.458 --> 00:25:42.333
Mmm.

467
00:25:42.417 --> 00:25:43.792
-Three days.
-Yes.

468
00:25:43.875 --> 00:25:45.417
-Three. Nurse.
-Yes.

469
00:25:45.917 --> 00:25:47.333
[Rosaline] Yet. the worst part is.

470
00:25:47.417 --> 00:25:48.625
it's my fault.

471
00:25:48.708 --> 00:25:50.000
I drove him to her.

[Lord Capulet] Ah. young Rosaline.

477
00:26:04.417 --> 00:26:07.917
Mmm. Uncle Capulet. what a surprise.

478
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
Rosaline.

479
00:26:09.083 --> 00:26:10.083
Aunt Lady. welcome.

480
00:26:10.167 --> 00:26:11.458
It's been too long.

481
00:26:12.083 --> 00:26:14.500
Oh. you remember your cousin. Tybalt.

482
00:26:16.375 --> 00:26:17.375
I do.

483

just returned from school.

489
00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:35.583
-[chuckling]
-[chuckles] Ah. Ow.

490
00:26:35.667 --> 00:26:37.250
I think my earring's caught.

491
00:26:37.333 --> 00:26:39.958
-Oh. just. uh. just a little to the left.
-[grunting]

492
00:26:40.042 --> 00:26:42.542
[chuckles] Oh. [chuckles. sighs]

493
00:26:42.625 --> 00:26:45.833
[both chuckling]

494
00:26:45.917 --> 00:26:50.000
-Wow. [chuckles] Wow. You're--
-[chuckling]

495
00:26:50.083 --> 00:26:52.375
All grown up now. I know. [chuckles]

496
00:26:52.458 --> 00:26:53.500
Oh.

497
00:26:53.583 --> 00:26:56.792
The last time I saw you. you had gaps
in your teeth. and you came up to here.

498
00:26:56.875 --> 00:26:59.250
Ah. it really has been a long time.

499
00:27:00.083 --> 00:27:01.792
We have so much to catch up on.

500
00:27:01.875 --> 00:27:06.583
-It's so lovely seeing you. [chuckling]
-[chuckles] Definitely. [chuckles]

501
00:27:07.125 --> 00:27:09.458
Oh. my God. [breathes heavily]

502
00:27:14.542 --> 00:27:16.417
[Lord Capulet]
Surely you know why I'm here. Adrian?

503
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:19.417
[Adrian] This is your quarrel.
brother. not mine.

504
00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:21.917
[Lord Capulet] It is all our quarrel.
You're a Capulet.

505
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.167
[Adrian] I don't like
the Montagues any more than you do.

506
00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:25.500
but that's why there's laws.

507
00:27:25.583 --> 00:27:27.167
[Lord Capulet]
We've let this get out of hand.

508
00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:30.417
It is up to us
to make this city great again.

509
00:27:31.125 --> 00:27:33.083
Can I say something?

510
00:27:33.792 --> 00:27:37.625
If you really hate the Montagues so much.
you could just move.

511
00:27:39.125 --> 00:27:40.667
I hear Siena is very nice.

512
00:27:41.208 --> 00:27:44.083
You let your daughter speak
at the dinner table?

513
00:27:44.167 --> 00:27:47.750
[Rosaline chuckles] I'm sorry.
I thought this was my house.

514
00:27:47.833 --> 00:27:48.833
[Adrian] Rosaline.

515
00:27:48.917 --> 00:27:51.333
What? I don't go to his house
and tell him how to do things.

516
00:27:51.417 --> 00:27:54.667
[Adrian] Rosaline.
take your cousin out to the garden.

517
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:56.500
I'm sure you have much to catch up on.

518
00:27:56.583 --> 00:27:58.958
-But Dad. the swan.
-The garden. Rosaline!

519
00:27:59.458 --> 00:28:01.458
-[whispers] Juliet.
-[Adrian] Now.

[chair scrapes]

521
00:28:08.833 --> 00:28:11.083
[smacks lips] Well. that was awkward.

522
00:28:14.583 --> 00:28:15.583
[sighs]

523
00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:23.333
Do you always talk to your dad like that?

524
00:28:24.417 --> 00:28:25.417
Whatever.

525
00:28:26.042 --> 00:28:29.750
[gasps]
God. I can't wait to be old like you.

You know. what's your rush?

528
00:28:36.375 --> 00:28:38.417
You won't be young forever. you know?

529
00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.583
And what about another year of.
uh. finishing school?

530
00:28:41.417 --> 00:28:42.625
That could be fun.

531
00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:46.375
Oh. [chuckles] I'm pretty finished.

532
00:28:47.375 --> 00:28:48.667
[sighs]

533
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:49.750
[Rosaline sighs]

534
00:28:50.708 --> 00:28:51.708
Rosaline.

535
00:28:53.292 --> 00:28:54.750
Can I tell you a secret?

536
00:28:55.917 --> 00:28:56.875
[Rosaline sighs]

537
00:28:56.958 --> 00:28:58.292
But you can't tell anyone.

538
00:28:59.958 --> 00:29:00.958
I'm listening.

539
00:29:02.083 --> 00:29:03.083
I'm in love.

540
00:29:03.917 --> 00:29:05.625
-[ball thuds]
-[bird squawks. flutters]

541
00:29:06.042 --> 00:29:07.542
-[sighs]
-I met a boy.

542
00:29:08.375 --> 00:29:09.208
[sighs]

543
00:29:09.292 --> 00:29:13.875
And he is just the most wonderful boy
in the whole world. [chuckles]

544
00:29:14.375 --> 00:29:16.125
I see. [stammers] Um--

545
00:29:16.208 --> 00:29:19.375
Where was it that you met this wonder boy?

546
00:29:19.458 --> 00:29:22.125
Oh. the other night
at the masquerade ball.

547
00:29:22.208 --> 00:29:25.417
And already.
I can't imagine my life without him.

548
00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:26.500
It's time to go.

549
00:29:26.583 --> 00:29:28.083
-[Juliet] He says things to me.
-Excuse me.

550
00:29:28.167 --> 00:29:32.250
Beautiful. romantic things.
You've never heard such poetry.

551
00:29:35.708 --> 00:29:36.792
Let me guess.

552
00:29:39.167 --> 00:29:42.083
He compares you to the moon and the sun.

553
00:29:44.125 --> 00:29:47.250
"The fairest stars in heaven
do entreat your eyes."

554
00:29:51.458 --> 00:29:54.792
-How-- How do you--
-It's Romeo Montague. isn't it?

555
00:29:57.792 --> 00:30:02.792
[breathes shakily]

556
00:30:03.333 --> 00:30:04.333
[Rosaline] Yeah.

557
00:30:05.208 --> 00:30:08.125
Everybody knows Romeo Montague. [chuckles]

558
00:30:08.708 --> 00:30:10.500
[breathes heavily]

559
00:30:11.208 --> 00:30:14.542
I'm afraid you're not the first
young maiden he's charmed with his…

560
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.625
high cheekbones and fancy words.

561
00:30:21.375 --> 00:30:23.208
I'm such a fool.

562
00:30:24.542 --> 00:30:26.708
Yeah. you kind of are.

563
00:30:27.875 --> 00:30:31.250
-[sighs]
-But don't beat yourself up about it.

564
00:30:31.333 --> 00:30:33.750
You know.
it could have happened to anybody.

565
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:35.750
Did it happen to you?

566
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.542
To me? No. please.

567
00:30:40.417 --> 00:30:44.958
Juliet. you're not even of marrying age.

568
00:30:45.042 --> 00:30:49.708
Why settle down with just one man
when you can. you know. live a little.

569
00:30:49.792 --> 00:30:53.167
play the field.
sample at the buffet of life?

570
00:30:54.958 --> 00:30:56.167
How do I do that?

571
00:30:59.042 --> 00:31:03.042
Well. I could show you. if you want.

572
00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:07.042
You would do that for me?

573
00:31:08.625 --> 00:31:10.042
What are cousins for? [chuckles]

574
00:31:10.625 --> 00:31:11.833
[giggles]

575
00:31:11.917 --> 00:31:15.917
[tavern-goers singing
"It's All Coming Back To Me Now"]

576
00:31:19.333 --> 00:31:21.292
[singing stops. clamors]

577
00:31:21.375 --> 00:31:23.958
Now. who wants to buy us some drinks?

578
00:31:24.042 --> 00:31:27.292
-Me! [yelling]
-Right here! Right here!

579
00:31:27.375 --> 00:31:33.958
[laughs] No. That is just so funny.
because I love sports.

580
00:31:34.042 --> 00:31:37.625
-Oh. really?
-Yeah. jousting. fencing. grappling.

581
00:31:37.708 --> 00:31:40.708
Oh. my God! I am a jouster!

582
00:31:40.792 --> 00:31:42.917
-What? No way!
-[laughs]

583
00:31:44.167 --> 00:31:45.833
Please. let me buy you another drink.

584
00:31:45.917 --> 00:31:47.542
Oh. um. We'll be right back.

585
00:31:48.333 --> 00:31:49.750
[chairs scrape]

586
00:31:51.375 --> 00:31:53.875
Okay. Now you try.

587
00:31:53.958 --> 00:31:56.792
Um. I don't know.

588
00:31:56.875 --> 00:31:59.125
-These men are so…
-Easy?

589
00:31:59.208 --> 00:32:00.208
Stupid!

590
00:32:00.875 --> 00:32:02.208
Why on Earth would I want to spend

591
00:32:02.292 --> 00:32:04.208
the rest of my life
with someone like that?

592
00:32:04.292 --> 00:32:05.292
-Ew.
-[patron belches]

593
00:32:05.375 --> 00:32:09.458
Juliet. you're not here to find someone
to spend your life with.

594
00:32:09.542 --> 00:32:13.583
You're here to just enjoy yourself
at their expense.

595
00:32:13.667 --> 00:32:16.708
and then never see them ever again. Okay?

596
00:32:16.792 --> 00:32:19.125
-Now. get out there and have some fun.
-Oh.

597
00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:21.750
Go on.

598
00:32:22.583 --> 00:32:25.250
Go. Go.

599
00:32:26.875 --> 00:32:27.875
Um.

600
00:32:28.625 --> 00:32:33.667
Uh. your-- your mustache is so thick.

601
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:35.875
-[patron] Oh. thank you.
-[Juliet giggles]

602
00:32:38.167 --> 00:32:39.417
[patron] Do you wanna have a seat?

603
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:40.667
[Juliet] May I? [giggles]

604
00:32:43.125 --> 00:32:46.042
Excuse me? Hello?

605
00:32:46.625 --> 00:32:48.333
Hello? Over here!

606
00:32:48.417 --> 00:32:50.250
[stammers] Hi. If-- If you could just--

607
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.958
-How are you. Rosaline?
-Admiral Shit-for-Brains.

608
00:32:57.417 --> 00:32:58.750
-[chuckles]
-[Rosaline] Hello?

609
00:33:01.542 --> 00:33:03.375
I'd like to order a drink. sir.

610
00:33:03.458 --> 00:33:04.500
[whistles]

611
00:33:08.833 --> 00:33:10.042
Thanks.

612
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.458
You know. when I first came to Verona.

613
00:33:21.583 --> 00:33:25.375
I thought the place would be filled with
women looking for a respectable husband.

614
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.667
Turns out. not so much.

615
00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:31.333
Are you the respectable
husband in that scenario?

616
00:33:33.875 --> 00:33:35.875
How is it going with
that boyfriend of yours?

617
00:33:35.958 --> 00:33:38.583
Good. Great. actually.

618
00:33:38.667 --> 00:33:40.833
And is he here? I'd love to meet him.

619
00:33:40.917 --> 00:33:44.083
No. he's-- He's actually busy tonight.

620
00:33:44.167 --> 00:33:45.042
Really?

621
00:33:45.125 --> 00:33:46.667
Dive bars aren't really his scene anyway.

622
00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:48.458
Ah. Shame.

623
00:33:49.375 --> 00:33:51.417
Well. I imagine he's very respectable.

624
00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:52.375
Yeah.

625
00:33:52.458 --> 00:33:57.167
He's witty and smart. writes sonnets.

626
00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:59.333
speaks several different
foreign languages.

627
00:33:59.417 --> 00:34:02.917
You know. just really the opposite of you.

628
00:34:04.292 --> 00:34:05.292
Is that so?

629
00:34:07.417 --> 00:34:08.417
[chuckles]

630
00:34:10.792 --> 00:34:12.500
Well. I will leave you to it then.

631
00:34:13.958 --> 00:34:14.958
You'll be missed.

632
00:34:17.708 --> 00:34:20.500
[in French]

633
00:34:32.417 --> 00:34:35.333
[laughing]

634
00:34:35.417 --> 00:34:38.458
All right. If you'll excuse me. I must go.

635
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.708
Hey. lady. Please.
you must let me see you some time.

636
00:34:41.792 --> 00:34:44.042
[patron] Back off. fella.
She was talking to me.

637
00:34:44.125 --> 00:34:46.375
Okay. bye. [laughs]

638
00:34:46.458 --> 00:34:48.125
[giggling]

639
00:34:48.208 --> 00:34:49.833
-Hey.
-Hi.

640
00:34:49.917 --> 00:34:54.417
Rosaline. I'm having so much fun.
Thank you. [laughs]

641
00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:56.667
Oh! Oh!

642
00:34:57.542 --> 00:34:59.583
-Ow! Oh! Ow!
-Oh.

643
00:35:00.083 --> 00:35:02.583
-[sighs] Not again. It's caught.
-Sorry. [grunts]

644
00:35:03.958 --> 00:35:07.458
[laughs] Every time.

645
00:35:08.625 --> 00:35:09.958
Hmm.

646
00:35:10.042 --> 00:35:12.417
Mmm. Mmm.

647
00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:14.583
And the best part is
you were totally right.

648
00:35:14.667 --> 00:35:17.042
I haven't thought about Romeo once.

649
00:35:17.125 --> 00:35:20.542
Well. in that case.
shall we do it again tomorrow?

650
00:35:22.625 --> 00:35:23.667
Yes.

651
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:24.667
[chuckles]

652
00:35:25.708 --> 00:35:28.333
[Rosaline] My dearest Romeo.
I haven't heard from you in a while.

653
00:35:28.417 --> 00:35:29.500
[chuckles] I hope you're okay.

654
00:35:29.583 --> 00:35:30.708
-What is your name?
-Oh. it's Juliet.

655
00:35:30.792 --> 00:35:32.083
Nothing much new over here.

656
00:35:32.167 --> 00:35:34.917
except I'm being forced to babysit
my younger cousin.

657
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.708
and she's really a handful.

658
00:35:36.792 --> 00:35:39.500
I've somehow fallen
into the role of big sister.

659
00:35:39.583 --> 00:35:40.667
Check.

660
00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:43.500
You know. older. wiser. more beautiful.

661
00:35:43.583 --> 00:35:44.583
Checkmate.

662
00:35:46.125 --> 00:35:47.875
[Rosaline]
At the very least. more worldly.

663
00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:55.333
They definitely didn't teach that
in finishing school.

664
00:35:56.333 --> 00:35:59.250
[scoffs] Wait till you get to page 74.

665
00:36:03.458 --> 00:36:04.292
[gasps]

666
00:36:04.375 --> 00:36:05.583
Be sure that he gets this.

667
00:36:05.667 --> 00:36:06.667
But enough about her.

668
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:11.083
I miss you and your warm embrace.
sweet Romeo.

669
00:36:11.167 --> 00:36:13.208
Yours. Rosaline.

670
00:36:14.583 --> 00:36:15.958
Dearest Romeo.

671
00:36:16.042 --> 00:36:19.625
You must be really busy.
because I still haven't heard from you.

672
00:36:19.708 --> 00:36:21.292
[laughs]

673
00:36:21.375 --> 00:36:24.333
I'm enclosing a map I made
of the Apennine mountains.

674
00:36:24.417 --> 00:36:28.708
I marked a trail to the perfect spot
for our remote mountaintop cabin.

675
00:36:28.792 --> 00:36:30.167
Write me back.

676
00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:32.833
I'm so lost without you.

677
00:36:32.917 --> 00:36:34.208
[sighs] Rosaline.

678
00:36:34.708 --> 00:36:36.208
-[water rushing]
-Where is that?

679
00:36:37.958 --> 00:36:40.208
It's the island of Cyprus
and Famagusta Bay.

680
00:36:42.083 --> 00:36:43.708
That's really beautiful.

681
00:36:45.917 --> 00:36:47.792
I'm sure you hear that all the time.
though.

682
00:36:49.667 --> 00:36:53.292
Uh. no. actually. I don't.

683
00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:55.500
Well. it's true.

684
00:37:00.917 --> 00:37:03.792
[Rosaline] Romeo. are you alive?

685
00:37:03.875 --> 00:37:05.542
Have you run out of quill ink?

686
00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:07.792
Why do you not return my letters?

687
00:37:08.458 --> 00:37:09.458
Steve!

688
00:37:11.125 --> 00:37:12.458
[bird caws]

689
00:37:13.042 --> 00:37:14.167
[sighs]

690
00:37:17.542 --> 00:37:22.917
The knight goes here.
and the pawn moves up one space.

691
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.500
And that is a Ponziani opening.

692
00:37:25.542 --> 00:37:29.042
[sighs] You're awesome.

693
00:37:29.125 --> 00:37:30.625
[both chuckle]

694
00:37:30.708 --> 00:37:32.292
-[laughs]
-[handler] Whoa! Whoa!

695
00:37:32.833 --> 00:37:34.833
-Whoa.
-[handler] Whoa. whoa!

696
00:37:34.917 --> 00:37:36.792
[Juliet] Oh. it's okay. It's okay.

697
00:37:36.875 --> 00:37:39.917
-[horse whinnies]
-[shushes]

698
00:37:40.667 --> 00:37:42.750
-[Juliet] You're fine. You're fine.
-[horse blusters]

699
00:37:43.917 --> 00:37:46.750
You're so handsome. Yes.

700
00:37:46.833 --> 00:37:48.042
You are so good.

701
00:37:48.708 --> 00:37:50.375
He's just a little spooked.

702
00:37:51.083 --> 00:37:54.625
[humming]

703
00:38:00.417 --> 00:38:01.917
-[knocks on door]
-[humming stops]

704
00:38:13.375 --> 00:38:14.583
Rosaline.

705
00:38:14.667 --> 00:38:15.667
-Hey.
-Hi.

706
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:18.292
Um. okay.

707
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:23.583
I… [sighs] …have to tell you something.

708
00:38:23.667 --> 00:38:24.875
Okay.

709
00:38:28.625 --> 00:38:31.125
Look. this-- [sighs]

710
00:38:31.208 --> 00:38:36.750
This really isn't easy to admit.
but I. um--

711
00:38:40.167 --> 00:38:41.083
What are those?

712
00:38:44.917 --> 00:38:45.917
Um…

713
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:50.167
He keeps writing me letters.

714
00:38:50.833 --> 00:38:52.333
He's been writing you letters?

715
00:38:59.833 --> 00:39:03.542
Uh. I mean.
I-I-I just thought you were done with him.

716
00:39:03.625 --> 00:39:06.458
I am. I was. No.

717
00:39:06.542 --> 00:39:10.000
No. I am. Um. but--
Uh. well. it's just. I feel-- [sighs]

718
00:39:10.083 --> 00:39:11.083
[Romeo] Juliet!

719
00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:14.125
Juliet!

720
00:39:17.292 --> 00:39:18.292
[inhales sharply] Um.

721
00:39:22.083 --> 00:39:23.083
[Romeo] Juliet!

722
00:39:23.583 --> 00:39:24.750
He keeps showing up.

723
00:39:24.833 --> 00:39:28.000
I won't go away until you talk to me.
sweet Juliet.

724
00:39:28.667 --> 00:39:31.583
Please. Rosaline. You gotta help me.

725
00:39:33.625 --> 00:39:34.792
Help you do what?

726
00:39:37.625 --> 00:39:39.958
[Juliet panting]

727
00:39:40.042 --> 00:39:42.875
Stand back. Romeo. Don't come any closer.

728
00:39:45.125 --> 00:39:47.417
Doth mine eyes deceive me?

729
00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:51.000
All the heavens shine in your direction.

730
00:39:51.083 --> 00:39:52.167
Stop him talking.

731
00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:53.625
-To gaze upon you--
-Stop talking.

732
00:39:53.708 --> 00:39:56.542
[sighs] I will not. Juliet.

733
00:39:56.625 --> 00:39:58.375
I will not and cannot.

734
00:39:58.458 --> 00:40:01.542
lest you tell me
what I have done to displease you.

735
00:40:01.625 --> 00:40:03.667
Fine. I'll tell you.

736
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:05.333
-You're a phony.
-You're a pony.

737
00:40:05.417 --> 00:40:07.958
-A what?
-[whispers] Phony. He's a phony.

738
00:40:08.042 --> 00:40:09.708
Uh. a phony. I said.

739
00:40:09.792 --> 00:40:11.583
You're a liar and a scoundrel.

740
00:40:11.667 --> 00:40:13.667
[Romeo] Juliet.
you know I'm none of those things.

741
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:15.750
So I was the first you compared
to the moon and the stars?

742
00:40:15.833 --> 00:40:18.958
Was I the first you compared
to the moon and the stars?

743
00:40:19.792 --> 00:40:21.542
[sighs] All right.

744
00:40:23.375 --> 00:40:26.667
Well. I will be honest with you.

745
00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:29.958
I-- I have said those words to another.

746
00:40:31.208 --> 00:40:33.375
But I never meant them until I met you.

747
00:40:33.875 --> 00:40:35.542
Oh. please!

748
00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:39.000
[Romeo] Is someone there with you?

749
00:40:39.542 --> 00:40:40.542
No.

750
00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:44.000
Juliet. we belong together.

751
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.792
You need to go. Romeo.

752
00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:49.958
That truly what you want?

753
00:40:53.125 --> 00:40:54.208
You need to go. Romeo.

754
00:40:59.792 --> 00:41:00.792
Then I will go.

755
00:41:05.292 --> 00:41:06.292
Gone for good.

756
00:41:15.708 --> 00:41:16.708
[sobs]

757
00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:45.250
You did well.

758
00:41:47.542 --> 00:41:49.667
So. why do I feel so terrible?

759
00:41:50.167 --> 00:41:51.708
[breathes shakily]

760
00:41:54.333 --> 00:41:55.667
Thank you. Cousin.

761
00:41:57.333 --> 00:41:59.208
I'd be lost without you.

762
00:42:02.083 --> 00:42:05.083
Wait. Wasn't there something
you wanted to tell me?

763
00:42:06.208 --> 00:42:08.375
Oh. No. it's not important.

764
00:42:09.125 --> 00:42:10.125
[chuckles]

765
00:42:10.208 --> 00:42:11.333
-Ow! Oh!
-[grunts]

766
00:42:12.167 --> 00:42:13.583
-Why does this keep happening?
-Sorry.

767
00:42:13.667 --> 00:42:15.917
-Okay. Well. you just need to--
-If I just-- [grunts]

768
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.792
-No. Just-- Mmm.
-[grunts. gasps] Oh!

769
00:42:18.875 --> 00:42:19.958
[chuckles]

770
00:42:22.833 --> 00:42:27.458
"Romeo and… Rosaline"?

771
00:42:33.667 --> 00:42:34.667
[gasps]

772
00:42:35.625 --> 00:42:36.750
Juliet.

773
00:42:36.833 --> 00:42:37.708
Don't speak.

774
00:42:42.333 --> 00:42:44.500
Juliet. It-- It's not what it--

775
00:42:44.583 --> 00:42:45.875
I listened to you.

776
00:42:47.333 --> 00:42:49.458
I trusted you.

777
00:42:49.542 --> 00:42:51.208
and all you did was lie.

778
00:42:51.292 --> 00:42:53.083
Juliet. I didn't lie.

779
00:42:53.167 --> 00:42:56.417
I just told you most of the truth

780
00:42:56.500 --> 00:43:00.542
instead of. well. you know. all of it.

781
00:43:01.625 --> 00:43:03.250
I thought you were my friend.

782
00:43:03.333 --> 00:43:05.583
I am your friend. I am.

783
00:43:05.667 --> 00:43:10.625
All this time. turns out you just wanted
to steal my boyfriend away.

784
00:43:10.708 --> 00:43:13.542
[scoffs] I was not trying
to steal your boyfriend away.

785
00:43:13.625 --> 00:43:15.125
I was just trying to steal him back.

786
00:43:15.792 --> 00:43:17.542
-Oh.
-There's a difference.

787
00:43:22.125 --> 00:43:23.167
I see how it is.

788
00:43:26.167 --> 00:43:27.167
Sure.

789
00:43:28.417 --> 00:43:32.125
I mean. it all makes perfect sense.
actually.

790
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:33.875
I'm younger than you.

791
00:43:34.917 --> 00:43:37.000
I'm… richer than you.

792
00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:39.625
I'm not afraid of fish.

793
00:43:40.708 --> 00:43:43.417
I don't have huge man feet.

794
00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:47.500
You needed me
out of the picture. [chuckles]

795
00:43:47.583 --> 00:43:49.000
Of course you did.

796
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.083
After all. what chance does someone like
you have when someone like me is around?

797
00:43:56.250 --> 00:43:57.250
[scoffs]

798
00:43:58.167 --> 00:44:03.250
Well. Cousin.
it appears your little gambit has failed.

799
00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:08.125
-Fine.
-Good.

800
00:44:08.208 --> 00:44:09.250
Great.

801
00:44:10.208 --> 00:44:13.083
Let me know next time
he shows up on your balcony.

802
00:44:13.167 --> 00:44:15.500
[laughs] Let me know
when your wisdom teeth come in.

803
00:44:16.625 --> 00:44:18.125
-What?
-You heard me!

804
00:44:18.208 --> 00:44:19.583
The point is. he's not coming.

805
00:44:19.667 --> 00:44:21.292
Guess we'll see about that. won't we?

806
00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:24.625
She's right. He's not coming.

807
00:44:24.708 --> 00:44:28.250
-Mmm. Oh.
-What's the use? It's hopeless.

808
00:44:28.333 --> 00:44:29.625
Rosaline. what is this?

809
00:44:30.625 --> 00:44:32.500
You need to focus and pull it together.

810
00:44:33.875 --> 00:44:34.875
Come here.

811
00:44:36.167 --> 00:44:38.667
I don't have a ton of time
for your drama right now. okay?

812
00:44:39.833 --> 00:44:44.250
Your father is not the only lord in town
who has a child he disapproves of.

813
00:44:44.333 --> 00:44:45.417
Mm-hmm.

814
00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:46.500
I'm sorry.

815
00:44:46.583 --> 00:44:48.875
If only I could just get him off the scent

816
00:44:48.958 --> 00:44:50.625
just for a little while.

817
00:44:51.708 --> 00:44:56.208
[gasps] Oh. this is cute. Mmm.

818
00:44:56.292 --> 00:44:57.958
-[laughing]
-[laughs]

819
00:44:58.042 --> 00:45:00.167
That's it! You marry her.

820
00:45:00.833 --> 00:45:02.625
-Who?
-Juliet.

821
00:45:02.708 --> 00:45:05.458
What? Have we met before? I'm-- I'm Paris.

822
00:45:06.292 --> 00:45:07.250
[scoffs]

823
00:45:08.667 --> 00:45:11.875
You need a decoy. She needs an obstacle.

824
00:45:11.958 --> 00:45:14.542
I need her out of the picture.

825
00:45:15.625 --> 00:45:16.667
It's perfect.

826
00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:21.292
Mm-hmm. Yeah. it's not perfect for me.
I don't wanna marry a woman.

827
00:45:21.375 --> 00:45:24.500
Yeah. I know. but that's the best part.

828
00:45:25.083 --> 00:45:29.125
You won't have to marry her for another.
like. two or three years.

829
00:45:29.208 --> 00:45:32.708
And by that time.
you could be far away from here.

830
00:45:33.458 --> 00:45:34.833
You could be wherever you want.

831
00:45:36.875 --> 00:45:37.875
Mmm.

832
00:45:38.417 --> 00:45:43.000
And do you promise
to care for her and protect her?

833
00:45:43.083 --> 00:45:44.083
Mm-hmm.

834
00:45:44.792 --> 00:45:49.917
And do you promise to guide her morally
and keep her on a righteous path?

835
00:45:50.625 --> 00:45:51.833
Oh. for sure.

836
00:45:51.917 --> 00:45:54.375
And. when the time is right.

837
00:45:54.458 --> 00:46:00.708
to bring a whole host of
strapping young men into your household?

838
00:46:00.792 --> 00:46:01.792
Wait. What?

839
00:46:02.417 --> 00:46:03.417
Sons. Paris.

840
00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:05.167
Ya-- [clears throat]

841
00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:08.625
[in deep voice]
Yes. absolutely. Sons. Mm-hmm.

842
00:46:08.708 --> 00:46:13.083
Then it fills me with the greatest of joy
to accept your request.

843
00:46:13.167 --> 00:46:18.000
[laughs] In two years' time.
when the girl is of marrying age.

844
00:46:18.083 --> 00:46:23.417
we will have the most glorious celebration
to unite our families.

845
00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:27.250
Two years. three years.
I mean. there's-- there's really no rush.

846
00:46:27.333 --> 00:46:29.417
And tonight. we'll feast.

847
00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:32.583
Go. Tell all of West Verona.

848
00:46:32.667 --> 00:46:37.708
and I will go tell the lucky girl
the good news. [squeals]

849
00:46:37.792 --> 00:46:40.875
-She'll be so excited! [laughs]
-[chuckling]

850
00:46:41.417 --> 00:46:42.458
[whimpers]

851
00:46:42.542 --> 00:46:44.458
[Juliet] You can't do this to me!

852
00:46:44.542 --> 00:46:46.583
[Lord Capulet]
Of course I can! I'm your father!

853
00:46:46.667 --> 00:46:47.708
-[Juliet] No!
-Juliet.

854
00:46:47.792 --> 00:46:53.292
every respectable family in Verona is
downstairs. celebrating your engagement.

855
00:46:53.375 --> 00:46:55.542
while you're up here embarrassing me!

856
00:46:55.625 --> 00:46:56.958
[door rattles. opens]

857
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.583
[pants] You know I'm not just
your daughter. right?

858
00:47:01.667 --> 00:47:05.542
I have opinions. ideas.
passions of my own!

859
00:47:06.042 --> 00:47:07.833
How dare you speak to us like that!

860
00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:10.542
You have ruined my life!

861
00:47:10.625 --> 00:47:12.083
-[Lady Capulet shouts]
-Juliet!

862
00:47:13.792 --> 00:47:15.500
I thought you'd be pleased.

863
00:47:15.583 --> 00:47:20.292
[stammers] Okay. he's Rosaline's friend.
Pretty big deal. he's a count.

864
00:47:21.333 --> 00:47:22.625
Rosaline's friend?

865
00:47:22.708 --> 00:47:25.250
Whole great life for your future. Please.

866
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.250
Oh! [grunts]

867
00:47:29.333 --> 00:47:30.208
[sighs]

868
00:47:30.875 --> 00:47:33.292
I'm so sorry. dear.
I don't know what's gotten into her.

869
00:47:33.958 --> 00:47:36.125
Oh. I know exactly what's gotten into her.

870
00:47:37.583 --> 00:47:40.667
Rosaline. this is all your fault.

871
00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:43.792
Whatever wild ideas you've been
filling my daughter's head with--

872
00:47:43.875 --> 00:47:46.208
-[guest] Hello.
-Good to see you.

873
00:47:46.292 --> 00:47:48.542
I need you to unfill it at once.

874
00:47:49.125 --> 00:47:50.250
-Go up to her room.
-Mm-hmm.

875
00:47:50.333 --> 00:47:52.333
-get her down to her party. please.
-Mm-hmm.

876

880
00:48:03.208 --> 00:48:04.500
The hell was he wearing?

[guests chattering. distantly]

882
00:48:17.542 --> 00:48:18.875
Juliet.

883
00:48:29.083 --> 00:48:30.083
Hello?

884
00:48:57.542 --> 00:48:59.333
"Hie you hence to the friar's cell.

885
00:48:59.417 --> 00:49:01.875
where tonight a true husband
shall make you a wife."

886
00:49:04.125 --> 00:49:05.125
Shit.

887
00:49:05.208 --> 00:49:07.375
[Rosaline] Excuse me.
Excuse me. I'm in a rush.

888
00:49:07.458 --> 00:49:08.458
[guest] Oh!

889
00:49:10.042 --> 00:49:12.708
[Rosaline] Please move.
I've got to stop a wedding right now.

890
00:49:12.792 --> 00:49:14.083
[Adrian] There she is.

891
00:49:14.167 --> 00:49:15.958
Look. it's Dario.

892
00:49:16.042 --> 00:49:20.417
-I really don't have time for this. What?
-Rosaline. do not be rude. please.

893
00:49:21.583 --> 00:49:22.583
[chuckles]

894
00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:26.583
-Mwah. Mwah.
-There we go.

895
00:49:27.083 --> 00:49:28.417
Okay. Good night.

896

Hey!

900
00:49:45.625 --> 00:49:46.625
Where are you going?

901
00:49:48.792 --> 00:49:49.917
What do you care?

902
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.125
I don't.

903
00:49:52.458 --> 00:49:53.917
Then what is it that you want?

904
00:49:56.250 --> 00:49:58.167
I want my knife back. please.

905
00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:02.083
[knife clatters]

906
00:50:02.167 --> 00:50:03.167
Worth a shot.

907
00:50:05.125 --> 00:50:07.417
[bird screeches. distantly]

908
00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:10.375
You aren't actually thinking
of going out there. are you?

909
00:50:10.458 --> 00:50:11.458
Yeah.

910
00:50:13.625 --> 00:50:15.042
Sure looks pretty dark.

911
00:50:15.833 --> 00:50:16.833
I can manage.

912
00:50:16.917 --> 00:50:19.000
[wolves howling]

913
00:50:19.083 --> 00:50:22.083
Look. I can--
I can walk with you if you'd like.

914
00:50:23.833 --> 00:50:25.958
I don't need an escort.

915
00:50:26.042 --> 00:50:29.167
Will just be taking this. See? This torch.

916
00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:31.833
To go in by myself.

917
00:50:31.917 --> 00:50:32.917
Mm-hmm.

918
00:50:34.625 --> 00:50:35.667

[creature yowls]

921
00:50:39.333 --> 00:50:40.625
Christ! What was that?

922
00:50:41.125 --> 00:50:42.292
Oh. it's probably nothing.

923
00:50:42.958 --> 00:50:46.208
-[sighs. chuckles] Okay.
-Yeah. or a bear.

924
00:50:47.958 --> 00:50:49.125
Hmm. [smacks lips]

925
00:50:50.458 --> 00:50:54.625
Okay. well. maybe just to
the. uh. bridge after the forest.

926
00:50:54.708 --> 00:50:56.708
[clears throat] What?
I'm sorry. What was that?

927
00:50:56.792 --> 00:51:00.958
Could you please
escort me through the forest?

928
00:51:02.208 --> 00:51:03.458
I would love to.

929
00:51:03.542 --> 00:51:05.167
[chuckles] Right.

930
00:51:05.250 --> 00:51:08.250
-Just great.
-[wolf howls]

931
00:51:16.583 --> 00:51:18.667
I'm sorry.
I can't tell you where we're going.

932
00:51:19.208 --> 00:51:20.208
Oh. you're fine.

933
00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:23.708
What I can say is it's urgent.

934
00:51:24.625 --> 00:51:25.917
Extremely urgent.

935
00:51:26.958 --> 00:51:27.958
Okay.

936
00:51:29.333 --> 00:51:30.792
You're not even a little curious?

937
00:51:30.875 --> 00:51:32.708
-I don't get involved.
-[scoffs]

938
00:51:35.458 --> 00:51:36.500
It's this way.

939
00:51:38.875 --> 00:51:42.250
Well. if you must know.
I'm going to stop a wedding.

940
00:51:43.583 --> 00:51:47.667
My boyfriend is about to make
the biggest mistake of his life.

941
00:51:48.583 --> 00:51:49.958
Uh. hang on a second. Wait.

942
00:51:52.167 --> 00:51:54.375
It's your boyfriend's wedding?

943
00:51:55.583 --> 00:51:56.500
Yeah.

944
00:51:57.833 --> 00:51:59.000
Ouch.

945
00:52:00.208 --> 00:52:03.708
Yeah. They just met.
They barely know each other.

946
00:52:03.792 --> 00:52:07.083
They have literally nothing in common.
He can't possibly love her.

947
00:52:07.167 --> 00:52:08.792
[stammers] How do you know that?

948
00:52:08.875 --> 00:52:09.958
Were you listening just now?

949
00:52:10.042 --> 00:52:12.375
They just met.
They barely know each other.

950
00:52:12.458 --> 00:52:13.750
-So what?
-No. like--

951
00:52:13.833 --> 00:52:16.167
That's not how love works.
It isn't rational.

952
00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:19.917
I knew you wouldn't understand.

953
00:52:21.375 --> 00:52:23.500
So what's your plan when we get there?

954
00:52:25.125 --> 00:52:27.917
We have to have a conversation.

955
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.250
He needs to know how I feel.

956
00:52:30.333 --> 00:52:32.917
Well. his wedding day seems
like the perfect time for that.

957
00:52:33.792 --> 00:52:36.833
We haven't had the chance
to talk about any of this.

958
00:52:36.917 --> 00:52:41.875
and I wanna show him
what life was like before he--

959
00:52:41.958 --> 00:52:42.958
Cheated on you.

960
00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:46.125
He did not cheat on me.

961
00:52:47.042 --> 00:52:48.167
Didn't he?

962
00:52:48.792 --> 00:52:50.125
I'm done talking to you now.

963
00:52:52.708 --> 00:52:54.458
[Dario] So is this a back way in or?

964
00:52:54.542 --> 00:52:56.917
Well. I'm not exactly
welcome in these parts.

965
00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.042
Oh. 'Cause you're the ex?

966
00:52:59.542 --> 00:53:00.958
No. 'cause I'm a Capulet.

967
00:53:03.125 --> 00:53:04.542
Wait. This is Montague land?

968
00:53:05.792 --> 00:53:08.375
-Yep.
-You never told me your ex was a Montague.

969
00:53:08.458 --> 00:53:09.500
Did I never mention that?

970
00:53:09.583 --> 00:53:10.458
-No.
-Hmm.

971
00:53:10.542 --> 00:53:12.208
If they find us. Rosaline.
they will kill us.

972
00:53:12.292 --> 00:53:16.167
-Well. you can go at any time.
-Look. this is no joke. It isn't safe.

973
00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:19.792
Relax. Romeo once told me that the guards
are off duty at this time of night.

974
00:53:19.875 --> 00:53:21.750
-The coast should be totally--
-Halt!

975
00:53:21.833 --> 00:53:23.042
Who goes there?

976
00:53:24.583 --> 00:53:25.958
[guard] Halt!

977

Which way did we come in?

983
00:53:35.708 --> 00:53:36.708
-Uh. that way. I think!
-[guard] Stop!

984
00:53:36.792 --> 00:53:38.917
-You think?
-I wasn't in the military!

Are you sure this is safe?

[clears throat]

1031
00:56:26.292 --> 00:56:27.750
Hey. let me ask you something.

1032
00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:31.333
What is it you like about this Montague?

1033
00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:36.208
Uh. lots of stuff.

1034
00:56:37.333 --> 00:56:38.750
In particular.

1035
00:56:40.083 --> 00:56:42.583
Well. we're in love.

1036
00:56:44.042 --> 00:56:45.458
Then what do you love about him?

1037
00:56:47.167 --> 00:56:48.542
[sighs] It's just--

1038
00:56:48.625 --> 00:56:51.667
It's not something
that you can put into words. so…

1039
00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:56.583
Love is patient.

1040
00:56:57.208 --> 00:56:58.542
Love is kind.

1041
00:56:58.625 --> 00:57:00.458
Love is an open door.

1042
00:57:00.542 --> 00:57:01.750
Love is all you need.

1043
00:57:04.083 --> 00:57:08.208
I mean. love is like knowing how to fly
or how to breathe.

1044
00:57:09.792 --> 00:57:13.792
When you're apart from her.
you can feel it in your stomach.

1045
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:15.875
You can taste it.

1046
00:57:16.917 --> 00:57:19.208
And when you're together. it's like…

1047
00:57:21.167 --> 00:57:23.208
it's impossible to believe
for one single minute

1048
00:57:23.292 --> 00:57:25.250
that anyone anywhere
has ever had so much fun

1049
00:57:25.333 --> 00:57:26.542
in the whole entire world.

1050
00:57:29.542 --> 00:57:30.958
That's what love is like.

1051
00:57:32.042 --> 00:57:33.583
put into words.

1052
00:57:34.292 --> 00:57:36.000
It's not that hard.

1053
00:57:37.125 --> 00:57:38.125
[grunts]

1054
00:57:50.208 --> 00:57:51.208

[Dario. clears throat]

1056
00:58:02.958 --> 00:58:04.250
I'm…

1057
00:58:05.917 --> 00:58:08.292
I'm sorry I got you into all this mess.

1058
00:58:09.917 --> 00:58:10.917
Wasn't all bad.

1059
00:58:12.292 --> 00:58:13.583
-And…
-[clears throat]

1060
00:58:14.375 --> 00:58:18.208
I'm sorry that I might have…

1061
00:58:19.667 --> 00:58:23.333
maybe misjudged you a little.

1062
00:58:23.417 --> 00:58:24.625
Your hand.

1063
00:58:26.167 --> 00:58:28.708
Oh. [scoffs] It's fine.
It's just a little. um--

1064
00:58:28.792 --> 00:58:29.792
[Dario] No.

1065
00:58:29.875 --> 00:58:32.958
I could probably get that later.

1066
00:58:39.292 --> 00:58:40.292
Is that okay?

1067
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:44.750
Yeah.

1068
00:58:55.917 --> 00:58:56.833
Thank you.

1069
00:58:58.417 --> 00:58:59.417
You're welcome.

[clears throat]

1074
00:59:22.750 --> 00:59:23.750
I should go.

1075
00:59:25.792 --> 00:59:28.083
Yeah. same.

1076
00:59:28.167 --> 00:59:30.625
No. uh. supposed to rejoin the fleet today

1077
00:59:30.708 --> 00:59:32.250
and I haven't even started to pack.

1078
00:59:33.167 --> 00:59:34.375
You're really going back?

1079
00:59:34.875 --> 00:59:35.875
Yeah.

1080
00:59:36.458 --> 00:59:37.458
Why?

1081
00:59:40.250 --> 00:59:42.833
I guess I didn't find
a good enough reason to stay.

1082
00:59:45.292 --> 00:59:47.125
Good luck. Rosaline.

1083
00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:52.708
It was interesting getting to know you.

1084
00:59:56.208 --> 00:59:57.208
You too. Dario.

1089
01:00:53.083 --> 01:00:54.083

[sighs] You scared me.

1093
01:00:59.333 --> 01:01:00.583
Good. that makes two of us.

[sighs]

1096
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.167
What on earth have you been
doing until six in the morning?

1097
01:01:11.417 --> 01:01:12.542
It's complicated.

1098
01:01:19.625 --> 01:01:21.500
Nurse. can I ask you something?

1099
01:01:25.542 --> 01:01:26.750
Have you ever been in love?

1100
01:01:28.333 --> 01:01:31.042
I was. once.

1101
01:01:34.125 --> 01:01:35.333
And what did it feel like?

1102
01:01:39.917 --> 01:01:41.542
It's a bit like having vertigo.

1103
01:01:43.958 --> 01:01:45.708
Quite a lot like being drunk.

1104
01:01:46.833 --> 01:01:49.333
But when it's real. you won't question it.

1105
01:01:54.375 --> 01:01:56.708

Yeah. what up. man?

1112
01:03:35.375 --> 01:03:36.875
Uh. special delivery.

1113
01:03:37.917 --> 01:03:40.083
[chuckles] Thanks. Chief.

1114
01:03:40.167 --> 01:03:44.500
Yeah. yeah. Oh. oh. also. um.
I got an envelope.

1115

You back already?

1122
01:04:21.333 --> 01:04:23.458
Uh. yes. Miss Rosaline.

1123
01:04:24.417 --> 01:04:29.167

-[Steve chuckles]

1125
01:04:31.542 --> 01:04:32.833
Did she seem pleased?

1126
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.625
Yeah. Pleased?

1127
01:04:35.708 --> 01:04:36.625

-Oh. oh.
-When you gave her the letter.

1130
01:04:40.208 --> 01:04:41.250
-Oh.
-Yeah.

1131
01:04:41.333 --> 01:04:44.917
Um. I-I gave it to the big dude instead.

1132
01:04:45.917 --> 01:04:47.625
Big dude?

1133
01:04:47.708 --> 01:04:49.708
W-W-What dude? W-Which dude?

1134
01:04:50.708 --> 01:04:52.167
Uh. Master Tybalt.

-[Montague] I'll speak any way I wish!

[Juliet] Father. please!

1147
01:05:16.625 --> 01:05:18.583

Look what you've done.

[onlooker cries]

1149

I should kill all of you!

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.458
[scoffs] I'd like to see you try.

1151

-Stop this!
-You great rooting hog!

-[sighs]
-Your son is a murderer.

1153
01:05:28.083 --> 01:05:31.500
It was self-defense.
Fire-eyed fury be my conduct now.

01:05:31.583 --> 01:05:32.667
You liar!

1155
01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:34.250
He's not lying.

1156
01:05:34.333 --> 01:05:39.500
He's honest and kind. and a good person.

1157
01:05:39.583 --> 01:05:42.583
His heart knows no hate or anger.

1158
01:05:42.667 --> 01:05:44.417
If he says that he was challenged.

1159
01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:46.458
then I promise you
that he's telling the truth.

1160
01:05:46.542 --> 01:05:49.625
I'm sorry. How do you know him?

1161
01:05:52.083 --> 01:05:53.792
[inhales sharply. sighs]

-Oh. my God.
-We're in love.

1164
01:05:59.708 --> 01:06:01.250
[Lady Capulet] I can't even watch them.

1165
01:06:01.333 --> 01:06:03.333
-Ah.
-Oh. boy.

1166
01:06:03.417 --> 01:06:05.750
You will never see him again.

1167
01:06:05.833 --> 01:06:08.917
And you will be banished.
Never to set foot in Verona again.

1168
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:09.833
No!

1169
01:06:09.917 --> 01:06:13.708
You will have this farce annulled
and marry Count Paris in the morrow.

1170
01:06:13.792 --> 01:06:14.792
[Juliet] Father. no!

1171
01:06:14.875 --> 01:06:17.000
-Uh. I'm sorry. what?
-You can't do this!

1172
01:06:17.083 --> 01:06:19.583
Y-Yeah. Tomorrow doesn't
really work for me either. So…

1173
01:06:19.667 --> 01:06:20.500
[Capulet] Guards!

1174
01:06:21.375 --> 01:06:22.750
-No!
-Detain him!

1175
01:06:22.833 --> 01:06:24.292
-He's getting away!
-[bystander screams]

1176
01:06:24.375 --> 01:06:25.542
Run. my heart!

1177
01:06:25.625 --> 01:06:28.250
I won't let them keep us apart. my love!

1178
01:06:29.250 --> 01:06:31.750
You know what this means. Lord Montague?

1179
01:06:31.833 --> 01:06:33.667
Yes. I do. Lord Capulet.

1180
01:06:34.583 --> 01:06:36.042
It means war!

1181
01:06:36.125 --> 01:06:37.167
You bald-headed peasant!

1182
01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:38.917
I'll see you soon. calf guts!

1183
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.333
-Give--
-Will you? [grunts]

1184
01:06:40.417 --> 01:06:41.333
[Lady Capulet] Stop.

1185
01:06:41.417 --> 01:06:42.917
[Lord Capulet] Summon my army for battle!

1186
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.167
Juliet. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'll fix this. I'll find a way.

1187
01:06:47.250 --> 01:06:49.042
Haven't you done enough already?

1188
01:07:00.542 --> 01:07:05.667
[Rosaline panting]
Oh. thank God you're still here.

1189
01:07:07.542 --> 01:07:08.875
Uh. okay.

1190
01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:12.917
I don't know if you heard about
the whole Romeo and Juliet thing?

1191
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.833
-But things got a little out of hand.
-Yeah.

1192
01:07:14.917 --> 01:07:15.917
I heard.

1193
01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:20.083
But not to worry. I've come up
with a plan to fix everything.

1194
01:07:20.167 --> 01:07:21.875
It's just gonna take you and I to--

1195
01:07:21.958 --> 01:07:25.792
Oh. I'm sorry. Wait.
You want my help with this?

1196
01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:27.667
I told you. I don't get involved.

1197
01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:29.042
Fine. except--

1198
01:07:29.125 --> 01:07:32.417
Besides. the last time I helped you.
we were almost killed.

1199
01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:34.042
Okay. but that's--

1200
01:07:34.125 --> 01:07:35.375
There is no "but." Rosaline.

1201
01:07:35.458 --> 01:07:38.750
Okay. Could you just at least
put on a shirt or something?

1202
01:07:40.167 --> 01:07:41.042

-[boat creaking]
-[footsteps]

1204
01:07:49.542 --> 01:07:50.583
Why?

1205
01:07:50.667 --> 01:07:55.542
Because I'm trying to have
a conversation here. and it's--

1206
01:07:57.250 --> 01:07:58.500
it's distracting.

1207
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:02.750
[sighs]

1208
01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:07.792
So I've made some mistakes.

1209
01:08:09.375 --> 01:08:11.042
Okay. a lot of mistakes.

1210
01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:15.292
I was wrong about Romeo.
I was wrong about Juliet.

1211
01:08:15.375 --> 01:08:18.750
I-I was even wrong about me
in a lot of ways.

1212
01:08:18.833 --> 01:08:22.000
But I know that
I'm not wrong about this. Dario.

1213
01:08:22.083 --> 01:08:23.750
We need to make this right.

1214
01:08:23.833 --> 01:08:24.958
There's that "we" again.

1215
01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:28.500
Yes. we.

1216
01:08:28.583 --> 01:08:31.042
'Cause another thing
I was wrong about. is you.

1217
01:08:34.875 --> 01:08:36.625
You're completely full of shit.

1218
01:08:37.583 --> 01:08:38.542
Oh. yeah?

1219
01:08:38.625 --> 01:08:42.875
The whole. "Oh. mmm. I don't care
about other people. I just--

1220
01:08:42.958 --> 01:08:45.208
I don't wanna get involved" nonsense.

1221
01:08:45.792 --> 01:08:47.500
It's a big load of crap. Dario.

1222
01:08:47.583 --> 01:08:48.542
[chuckles]

1223
01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:50.125
You care about people.

1224
01:08:51.750 --> 01:08:53.042
You're a good person.

1225
01:08:55.833 --> 01:08:58.000
This is 'cause I have a boat. isn't it?

1226
01:08:58.583 --> 01:09:00.000
No. that's--

1227
01:09:00.083 --> 01:09:01.208
They're in trouble.

1228
01:09:02.167 --> 01:09:05.667
They're in trouble. and I'm responsible.

1229
01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:08.458
I need to fix this.

1230
01:09:10.625 --> 01:09:11.917
Will you please help me?

1231
01:09:16.542 --> 01:09:18.417
First sign of danger and I'm out of there.

1232
01:09:19.208 --> 01:09:20.542
-Fine.
-Seriously.

1233
01:09:20.625 --> 01:09:22.292
I'm not getting killed over this.

1234
01:09:22.375 --> 01:09:23.875
Yeah. I-I-I just said fine.

1235
01:09:33.583 --> 01:09:34.583
Okay.

1236
01:09:36.833 --> 01:09:38.792
-[sighs]
-Let's go save true love.

1237
01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:42.167
Great. Um… [stammers]

1238
01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:43.833
Is it cool if we borrow the boat?

1239
01:09:46.417 --> 01:09:47.750
[stammers]

1240
01:09:52.167 --> 01:09:53.167
[Juliet sighs]

1241
01:09:57.042 --> 01:09:59.333
-[door opens]
-[light grunt]

1242
01:09:59.917 --> 01:10:01.542
Shh. Now be quiet.

1243
01:10:01.625 --> 01:10:02.542
[Dario] Ow.

1244
01:10:02.625 --> 01:10:03.917
Rosaline!

1245
01:10:05.917 --> 01:10:07.208
Hey.

1246
01:10:07.292 --> 01:10:08.750
What are you doing here?

1247
01:10:08.833 --> 01:10:11.292
I have come to help you.

1248
01:10:12.167 --> 01:10:14.125
I don't want your help. Rosaline.

1249
01:10:14.208 --> 01:10:15.250
I know that.

1250
01:10:15.333 --> 01:10:18.083
And again.
I'm really. really. really sorry.

1251
01:10:18.167 --> 01:10:22.458
But we've got a boat. [chuckles]

1252
01:10:22.542 --> 01:10:25.667
Well. actually-- actually. Dario--
Dario has a boat.

1253
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:26.667
[Dario] Hello.

1254
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:28.917
We'll get Romeo.
smuggle you both to the docks.

1255
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.458
and then. under the cover of darkness.

1256
01:10:30.542 --> 01:10:33.417
you'll sail to safety before anyone
realizes that you're gone.

1257
01:10:35.375 --> 01:10:39.500
That's. um. very kind of you. Cousin.

1258
01:10:40.708 --> 01:10:41.917
But I already have a plan.

1259
01:10:43.292 --> 01:10:44.292
You do?

1260
01:10:44.792 --> 01:10:46.250
[cage rattles]

1261
01:10:46.333 --> 01:10:49.250
Okay. that's-- that's great.

1262
01:10:49.333 --> 01:10:51.458
Uh. w-what is it?

1263
01:10:51.542 --> 01:10:53.458
I'm going to fake my own death.

1264
01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:55.583
Sorry. what?

1265
01:10:55.667 --> 01:10:56.500
It's simple.

1266
01:10:56.583 --> 01:11:00.917
There's this potion that causes
total body paralysis for hours at a time.

1267
01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.500
I'll drink it. they'll find me.
it'll look like I'm dead.

1268
01:11:03.583 --> 01:11:05.125
then they'll prepare me for burial.

1269
01:11:05.917 --> 01:11:07.500
Then. once they leave. I'll wake up.

1270
01:11:08.292 --> 01:11:09.667
Romeo will then come out of hiding.

1271
01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:13.167
He's at the Montague chapel
with Benvolio right now.

1272
01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.833
Then he'll find me in the church.
carry me off into the sunset.

1273
01:11:16.917 --> 01:11:18.917
and we'll live happily ever after.

1274
01:11:19.625 --> 01:11:20.625
It's foolproof.

1275
01:11:21.583 --> 01:11:23.625
Mmm. okay. Juliet.

1276
01:11:24.375 --> 01:11:28.917
that is quite possibly the dumbest fucking
thing I've ever heard in my life.

1277
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:29.958
Are you kidding me?

1278
01:11:30.042 --> 01:11:32.750
There's. like. 50 different ways that
that could go wrong.

1279
01:11:32.833 --> 01:11:34.917
I mean.
what if the potion has side effects?

1280
01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:39.292
What if they actually bury you?
Have you thought of that?

1281
01:11:39.875 --> 01:11:41.583
What if Romeo thinks you're really dead?

1282
01:11:42.458 --> 01:11:45.333
I've-- I've sent Steve the Courier
to tell him.

1283
01:11:45.417 --> 01:11:47.583
Steve the Courier is an idiot!

1284
01:11:47.667 --> 01:11:48.792
You've gotta trust me.

1285
01:11:48.875 --> 01:11:51.208
-My plan is better. Let's go.
-[groans]

1286
01:11:51.708 --> 01:11:52.708
Juliet?

1287
01:11:52.792 --> 01:11:54.292
-[Juliet groans]
-What did-- What--

1288
01:12:00.167 --> 01:12:01.333
Did you drink it already?

1289
01:12:01.958 --> 01:12:03.750
-[quick footsteps]
-[Rosaline grunts]

1290
01:12:03.833 --> 01:12:06.375
Okay. [grunts] All right.

1291
01:12:06.458 --> 01:12:09.958
When you wake up. you'll be right
next to Romeo. okay? I promise.

1292
01:12:10.042 --> 01:12:11.500
Everything's gonna be just fine.

1293
01:12:11.583 --> 01:12:13.542
Okay. wow. [chuckles]

1294
01:12:13.625 --> 01:12:16.417
Dario. you ready? [pants]

1295
01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:17.833
[whispers] Yeah. I am.

1296
01:12:17.917 --> 01:12:18.917
[Rosaline] You sure?

1297
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.375
Yes. just toss her to me.

1298
01:12:23.542 --> 01:12:25.250
Okay. On three.

1299
01:12:26.458 --> 01:12:29.500
One… [panting]

1300
01:12:31.375 --> 01:12:32.500
Nope. Oh--

1301
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.083
[grunts] One. [sighs]

1302
01:12:36.167 --> 01:12:37.583
-[Lord Capulet] Juliet?
-[knocking]

1303
01:12:37.667 --> 01:12:38.583
Shit.

1304
01:12:39.417 --> 01:12:40.417
[Lord Capulet] Juliet!

1305
01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:42.458
[grunting] Wake up. Juliet!

1306
01:12:42.542 --> 01:12:44.083
Dario. save yourself.

1307
01:12:44.167 --> 01:12:45.083
[banging on door]

1308
01:12:45.167 --> 01:12:46.958
[Lord Capulet] Open this door at once!

1309
01:12:47.417 --> 01:12:49.167
[Rosaline] That sneaky son of a bitch!

1310
01:12:49.250 --> 01:12:50.292
Juliet!

1311
01:12:52.292 --> 01:12:53.792
Okay. it's not what it looks like.

1312
01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:56.208
[door creaks]

1313
01:12:56.292 --> 01:12:57.417
If you just-- [grunts]

1314
01:12:57.958 --> 01:12:59.167
If you just let me explain.

1315
01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:03.208
I think we could really just have
a nice talk and talk about it.

1316
01:13:03.292 --> 01:13:05.042
And I can explain everything. Please.

1317
01:13:05.917 --> 01:13:06.875
-[sighs]
-[door locks]

1318
01:13:06.958 --> 01:13:07.917
[bell chiming]

1319
01:13:09.250 --> 01:13:10.250
Okay.

1320
01:13:13.458 --> 01:13:15.708
[door unlocks. opens]

1321
01:13:18.542 --> 01:13:19.417
Oh. thank God.

1322
01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:21.750
Okay. you have got to help me. Father.

1323
01:13:21.833 --> 01:13:24.167
They found Juliet in your arms.

1324
01:13:24.250 --> 01:13:25.625
Yeah. I know.

1325
01:13:25.708 --> 01:13:27.583
And I-- I can explain that.

1326
01:13:27.667 --> 01:13:30.042
but right now. I just need you
to help me get out of here.

1327
01:13:30.125 --> 01:13:33.000
Rosaline. your cousin is dead.

1328
01:13:33.083 --> 01:13:35.167
-Who knows she's dead?
-The whole town.

1329
01:13:35.250 --> 01:13:37.583
[sighs] Okay. look.

1330
01:13:38.583 --> 01:13:42.167
Things seem really bad right now.
I get it.

1331
01:13:42.250 --> 01:13:46.875
But you know me. and you know
I would never ever hurt Juliet.

1332
01:13:49.167 --> 01:13:53.250
Look. I know I'm not exactly
the daughter you wish I was

1333
01:13:53.333 --> 01:13:59.167
but. just this once.
I need you to trust me. please.

1334
01:14:02.833 --> 01:14:04.750
I honestly don't know what to think.

1335
01:14:11.958 --> 01:14:15.083
But you will always be
the daughter I wish you were.

1336
01:14:20.208 --> 01:14:22.667
Guards! A Montague. Over there!

1337
01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:24.542
-Go! Go!
-[footsteps running]

1338
01:14:24.625 --> 01:14:26.792
[guard] Halt. Don't let him get away!

1339
01:14:28.125 --> 01:14:29.542
[panting]

1340
01:14:34.667 --> 01:14:36.167
-My lord.
-[bell tolling]

1341
01:14:36.750 --> 01:14:38.417
Juliet Capulet is dead.

1342
01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:39.958
Suicide. apparently.

1343
01:14:40.042 --> 01:14:41.708
They're burying her body in the church.

1344
01:14:43.125 --> 01:14:45.542
Where Juliet lies.
Romeo shan't be far away.

1345
01:14:46.667 --> 01:14:48.667
We must get to him
before the Capulets. Come!

1346
01:15:02.875 --> 01:15:04.917
[water rushing]

1347
01:15:10.333 --> 01:15:11.542
Okay.

1348
01:15:12.792 --> 01:15:14.000
Uh…

1349
01:15:15.667 --> 01:15:19.708
[sighs]
It's okay. It's okay. You got this.

1350
01:15:20.417 --> 01:15:24.417
Just pretend they're something else.
You know. leaves with gaping mouths.

1351
01:15:25.125 --> 01:15:26.458
[sighs]

1352
01:15:28.083 --> 01:15:29.583
Okay. just get in.

1353
01:15:29.667 --> 01:15:32.125
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. I'm in. I'm in.

1354
01:15:32.208 --> 01:15:35.333
[groans] Okay. [huffs] Yes.

1355
01:15:35.417 --> 01:15:37.375
Oh. my God. What was that? What was that?

1356
01:15:37.458 --> 01:15:39.000
[groans] What was that?

1357
01:15:39.083 --> 01:15:42.625
[pants] Okay. [stammers] It's just a leaf.
It was just a leaf.

1358
01:15:43.458 --> 01:15:44.750
Mmm. just a leaf.

1359
01:15:44.833 --> 01:15:47.417
[grunts] I made it. I made it.

1360
01:15:49.875 --> 01:15:50.958
This is not gonna work.

1361
01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:56.292
My lady. your clothes.

1362
01:15:56.375 --> 01:15:57.583
Where's-- Where's Romeo?

1363
01:15:57.667 --> 01:15:58.667
[pants]

1364
01:15:59.208 --> 01:16:01.750
-Um. [smacks lips] I. uh--
-[sighs]

1365
01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:06.167
Focus. Did he get the message?

1366
01:16:06.667 --> 01:16:08.417
-What message?
-From Juliet.

1367
01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:11.000
[sighs] Oh. my God.

1368
01:16:11.583 --> 01:16:13.042
Okay. Okay.

1369
01:16:13.125 --> 01:16:14.792
-Can. uh--
-Mmm. Mm-hmm.

1370
01:16:15.292 --> 01:16:16.417
Oh. dear God.

1371
01:16:23.167 --> 01:16:30.125
[panting]

1372
01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:31.708
[grunts]

1373
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Oh. no. no. no.

1374
01:16:36.083 --> 01:16:39.083
[panting] Oh. my God.

1375
01:16:39.167 --> 01:16:41.667
-Uh. Rosaline. no. You-- [grunts]
-You! You get out of my way!

1376
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:42.750
[huffs]

1377
01:16:43.625 --> 01:16:45.167
Oh. Oh. my God.

1378
01:16:45.667 --> 01:16:47.458
No. no. it's not real.

1379
01:16:47.542 --> 01:16:49.458
Juliet's alive. She's al--

1380
01:16:49.542 --> 01:16:51.625
Get a grip. Rosaline.

1381
01:16:51.708 --> 01:16:53.208
I was trying to tell you.

1382
01:16:53.292 --> 01:16:55.375
But you-- you ran away.

1383
01:16:55.458 --> 01:16:56.750
As fast as I could.

1384
01:16:56.833 --> 01:16:59.208
Oh. you ran to him.

1385
01:16:59.292 --> 01:17:00.542
Someone had to.

1386
01:17:00.625 --> 01:17:03.417
I mean. the kid was gonna off himself
when he heard the news.

1387
01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:05.417
[church bell tolling]

1388
01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:08.417
[sighs] Uh. what now?

1389
01:17:09.083 --> 01:17:13.083
He said you would know what to do
because you're a… genius?

1390
01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:17.667
Hmm. [smacks lips]

1391
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:20.208
Okay. lay down as you were.

1392
01:17:20.875 --> 01:17:23.042
Close your eyes. Quickly.

1393
01:17:24.875 --> 01:17:26.042
Now you're both dead.

1394
01:17:26.667 --> 01:17:28.917
Star-crossed lovers
that couldn't live apart.

1395
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000
That's pretty good.

1396
01:17:30.083 --> 01:17:31.708
Uh. you think that's gonna work?

1397
01:17:32.333 --> 01:17:34.250
I mean. it might if she doesn't wake up.

1398
01:17:34.333 --> 01:17:35.667
[door opens]

1399
01:17:37.333 --> 01:17:38.542
-[clears throat]
-[sighs]

1400
01:17:38.625 --> 01:17:40.333
[footsteps approaching]

1401
01:17:40.417 --> 01:17:41.458
Oh!

1402
01:17:41.542 --> 01:17:44.333
Heaven forsake me! [whimpers]

1403
01:17:44.417 --> 01:17:46.875
Oh. no! Why?

1404
01:17:46.958 --> 01:17:48.542
[whimpers]

1405
01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:51.500
What is she doing here?

1406
01:17:51.583 --> 01:17:54.208
-[Adrian] Rosaline?
-What are all of you doing here?

1407
01:17:54.292 --> 01:17:56.625
[Lord Montague]
Where is my boy? Where is he?

1408
01:17:57.208 --> 01:17:58.417
Lord Montague.

1409
01:17:58.500 --> 01:17:59.375
[Lady Montague gasps]

1410
01:17:59.458 --> 01:18:01.875
I'm sorry. but I'm afraid you're too late.

1411
01:18:01.958 --> 01:18:02.958
No.

1412
01:18:05.625 --> 01:18:08.500
Dear. foolish boy. [sighs]

1413
01:18:08.583 --> 01:18:11.333
There were so many things
I never got to tell you.

1414
01:18:11.833 --> 01:18:14.292
Come back to me!

1415
01:18:14.375 --> 01:18:16.667
-Oh. All right. well--
-Foolish boy! [sighs]

1416
01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:18.250
Come back to me!

1417
01:18:18.333 --> 01:18:20.708
Uh. shaking him won't bring him back. So…

1418
01:18:21.875 --> 01:18:22.875
[high-pitched groan]

1419
01:18:24.250 --> 01:18:26.125
[imitates groan. clears throat]

1420
01:18:27.250 --> 01:18:30.000
Sorry. wrong pipe.

1421
01:18:30.667 --> 01:18:34.792
Capulet. your daughter
is responsible for the death of my son!

1422
01:18:34.875 --> 01:18:36.583
You are such a liar!

1423
01:18:37.083 --> 01:18:40.750
Truth be told. Montague.
you are the one to blame.

1424
01:18:40.833 --> 01:18:43.167
[Lord Montague scoffs]
I should kill you now.

1425
01:18:43.250 --> 01:18:45.833
For the love of God!

1426
01:18:45.917 --> 01:18:48.333
Will you stop fighting?

1427
01:18:48.417 --> 01:18:50.333
This is all your faults.

1428
01:18:50.417 --> 01:18:51.917
-You.
-What?

1429
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.000
-And you.
-[scoffs]

1430
01:18:53.583 --> 01:18:55.792
Every single one of you people.

1431
01:18:55.875 --> 01:18:57.500
They'd still be alive if not for

1432
01:18:57.583 --> 01:19:03.000
your baseless judgments and blind hatred
and petty squabbling.

1433
01:19:03.083 --> 01:19:05.250
Adrian. control your daughter.

1434
01:19:05.333 --> 01:19:07.042
Shut it. Mario. Let her speak.

1435
01:19:07.125 --> 01:19:08.500
[huffs. sighs]

1436
01:19:08.583 --> 01:19:09.792
He was a Montague.

1437
01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:12.000
She was a Capulet.

1438
01:19:12.708 --> 01:19:13.708
So what?

1439
01:19:15.250 --> 01:19:18.708
That didn't stop them from
seeing the beauty in each other.

1440
01:19:20.125 --> 01:19:22.667
That didn't stop them
from falling in love.

1441
01:19:23.542 --> 01:19:25.042
You know what did stop them?

1442
01:19:26.958 --> 01:19:28.167
You did.

1443
01:19:29.917 --> 01:19:32.375
This-- This stupid war.

1444
01:19:32.458 --> 01:19:34.500
This-- This-- This selfishness.

1445
01:19:34.583 --> 01:19:37.250
Shame on you!

1446
01:19:39.458 --> 01:19:41.625
And-- And-- And shame on your houses!

1447
01:19:41.708 --> 01:19:42.708
[Dario] A little unfair.

1448
01:19:44.292 --> 01:19:45.667
Mmm. she's right. you know?

1449
01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:46.792
[chuckles]

1450
01:19:47.292 --> 01:19:49.167
-Well. it is our fault.
-Mmm?

1451
01:19:49.250 --> 01:19:51.417
-Theirs mostly.
-[Lady Montague] Ah. that's what I meant.

1452
01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:55.000
The two of you
with your heads stuck right up your asses.

1453
01:19:55.083 --> 01:19:57.667
-Oh. no.
-[all gasps. clamors]

1454
01:19:57.750 --> 01:19:58.750
Mmm.

1455
01:20:01.042 --> 01:20:03.500
Perhaps enough blood has been shed.

1456
01:20:05.917 --> 01:20:08.083
Let's end this war. Capulet.

1457
01:20:08.917 --> 01:20:12.000
If their deaths be the last.
they shall not have died in vain.

1458
01:20:13.250 --> 01:20:15.500
So. let our families be close.

1459
01:20:15.583 --> 01:20:18.583
United by the loss we share today.

1460
01:20:19.708 --> 01:20:21.583
May peace reign here a while. hmm?

1461
01:20:22.167 --> 01:20:24.042
And let their spirits rest in Heaven.

1462
01:20:24.542 --> 01:20:31.292
[Lord Capulet] May angels sing their
praises in their resting place. [gasps]

1463
01:20:31.875 --> 01:20:35.750
Let their names be inscribed in marble
across the land.

1464
01:20:35.833 --> 01:20:36.833
[Lord Capulet] Good marble.

1465
01:20:36.917 --> 01:20:40.792
[Lord Montague] Expensive marble.
Rich Corinthian marble. Porphyry.

1466
01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:42.625
Porphyry's good.

1467
01:20:42.708 --> 01:20:44.542
-And even wood.
-[mouthing] What?

1468
01:20:44.625 --> 01:20:45.625
[Lord Capulet] Wood?

1469
01:20:45.708 --> 01:20:49.333
[Lord Montague] Wooden doors.
no. church doors. Fountains.

1470
01:20:49.417 --> 01:20:52.292
-Mmm. Good call.
-Oh. w-what? Oh. she's alive!

1471
01:20:52.375 --> 01:20:55.708
-[Lord Capulet] My daughter?
-[Lady Capulet gasps. chuckles]

1472
01:20:55.792 --> 01:20:56.958
[all gasps. clamors]

1473
01:20:57.042 --> 01:20:59.417
-Romeo. [breathes heavily] Romeo!
-[gasps]

1474
01:21:00.417 --> 01:21:05.250
I will kiss thy lips. Haply some poison
yet doth remain on them. [inhales sharply]

1475
01:21:05.333 --> 01:21:06.833
-Juliet. no!
-No! Uh--

1476
01:21:06.917 --> 01:21:08.708
[kisses. breathes heavily]

1477
01:21:08.792 --> 01:21:10.458
Thy lips are warm.

1478
01:21:10.542 --> 01:21:14.167
-[pants. groans]
-Ju--

1479
01:21:16.417 --> 01:21:17.417
[gasps]

1480
01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:18.917
Okay. what the hell was that?

1481
01:21:19.417 --> 01:21:21.000
Is there a doctor in the house?

1482
01:21:21.083 --> 01:21:23.833
Yeah. yeah.
we'd like to have some confirmation.

1483
01:21:23.917 --> 01:21:26.042
Step aside. Step aside.

1484
01:21:26.125 --> 01:21:29.000
Thank you. Thank you.
Professional coming through.

1485
01:21:32.417 --> 01:21:33.500
[clears throat]

1486
01:21:38.833 --> 01:21:39.917
Yes.

1487
01:21:40.958 --> 01:21:42.833
They are definitely dead.

1488
01:21:42.917 --> 01:21:45.167
-[Lady Capulet] Oh!
-How can you be sure?

1489
01:21:45.917 --> 01:21:47.292
How can I be sure?

1490
01:21:48.208 --> 01:21:53.708
For the love of God.
I am a registered bloody nurse!

1491
01:21:54.333 --> 01:21:55.833
I thought that was just your name.

1492
01:21:55.917 --> 01:21:57.458
No. my name's Janet.

1493
01:21:58.625 --> 01:22:01.083
Well. Montagues. Capulets. anon.

1494
01:22:01.167 --> 01:22:02.667
Capulets. anon.

1495
01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:04.875
Capulets. anon.

1496
01:22:05.708 --> 01:22:07.708
Mmm. they couldn't--

1497
01:22:08.542 --> 01:22:10.208
They couldn't live in peace.

1498
01:22:12.417 --> 01:22:14.167
At least let them rest in it.

1499
01:22:19.083 --> 01:22:20.292
[all chattering]

1500
01:22:20.375 --> 01:22:24.250
Let us take our leave
of this dreary scene.

1501
01:22:24.917 --> 01:22:26.917
[Lord Montague] I know a very fine spot.

1502
01:22:28.917 --> 01:22:30.042
[footsteps departing]

1503
01:22:30.125 --> 01:22:32.708
[sighs]

1504
01:22:37.875 --> 01:22:39.875
Okay. they're gone. You can wake up now.

1505
01:22:39.958 --> 01:22:41.500
-[pants]
-[gasps]

1506
01:22:41.583 --> 01:22:42.583
[Rosaline chuckles]

1507
01:22:42.667 --> 01:22:44.000
I love you so much.

1508
01:22:44.083 --> 01:22:47.125
-I love you so much more.
-[sighs] I love you so much more.

1509
01:22:47.208 --> 01:22:48.542
[both chuckle]

1510
01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.083
Tell me the truth.

1511
01:22:57.542 --> 01:22:59.458
You could be halfway to Venice by now.

1512
01:23:00.625 --> 01:23:01.875
What made you come back?

1513
01:23:04.917 --> 01:23:06.083
I don't know.

1514
01:23:06.167 --> 01:23:09.333
There's just something about you
that makes me do stupid things.

1515
01:23:13.958 --> 01:23:15.001
[waves crashing]

1516
01:23:16.583 --> 01:23:21.875
[seagulls squawking]

1517
01:23:21.958 --> 01:23:24.792
Well. I'll never forget you. Rosaline.

1518
01:23:24.875 --> 01:23:26.167
Back at you. Romeo.

1519
01:23:26.250 --> 01:23:27.417
It's been real.

1520
01:23:27.958 --> 01:23:30.167
Get in here. Ah.

1521
01:23:35.625 --> 01:23:36.625
Okay.

1522
01:23:36.708 --> 01:23:42.917
So. you should plan to land
at Paphos Harbor.

1523
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.500
But if the wind picks up
and you end up at the Meleti Forest.

1524
01:23:45.583 --> 01:23:47.375
that's also supposed to be really great.

1525
01:23:48.750 --> 01:23:49.750
[sighs]

1526
01:23:50.458 --> 01:23:55.375
Thank you. Rosaline. for everything.

1527
01:23:57.375 --> 01:23:58.625
What are cousins for?

1528
01:24:00.375 --> 01:24:01.208
[chuckles]

1529
01:24:01.875 --> 01:24:02.958
-[chuckles]
-[grunts]

1530
01:24:06.083 --> 01:24:09.542
Whilst the Heavens and Earth
circle vermilion stars. so are--

1531
01:24:09.625 --> 01:24:11.042
Romeo. just get in the boat.

1532
01:24:11.125 --> 01:24:12.250
Yes. milady.

1533
01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:18.292
-Okay. buddy.
-And you-- [stammers. clears throat]

1534
01:24:18.792 --> 01:24:20.792
[chuckles] Thank you.

1535
01:24:21.875 --> 01:24:24.000
Okay. [pants]

1536
01:24:26.417 --> 01:24:27.417
[kisses]

1537
01:24:32.208 --> 01:24:33.208
[sighs]

1538
01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.625
I'm really gonna miss that boat.

1539
01:24:49.167 --> 01:24:50.167
I know.

1540
01:24:54.833 --> 01:24:56.292
Have you ever been to Cyprus?

1541
01:24:56.792 --> 01:24:58.167
No. Have you?

1542
01:24:58.250 --> 01:24:59.250
No.

1543
01:25:04.708 --> 01:25:05.708
It's an island.

1544
01:25:07.167 --> 01:25:08.167
Yeah.

1545
01:25:08.667 --> 01:25:09.667
Mmm.

1546
01:25:15.458 --> 01:25:16.292
[sighs]

1547
01:25:25.625 --> 01:25:26.875
Let me ask you something.

1548
01:25:29.125 --> 01:25:30.125
Yeah?

1549
01:25:31.458 --> 01:25:35.042
Would you. uh. ever--

1550
01:25:37.042 --> 01:25:41.958
You know. if I got another boat.
[sighs] Maybe wanna--

1551
01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:57.750
I'll think about it.

1552
01:26:16.792 --> 01:26:20.792
You know. centuries from now.
when everyone's telling this story.

1553
01:26:21.667 --> 01:26:23.792
you think you and I
will even be mentioned?

1554
01:26:26.833 --> 01:26:31.375
Honestly… I couldn't care less.

1555
01:26:33.458 --> 01:26:34.458
Me neither.

1556
01:26:34.542 --> 01:26:36.625
[pop song begins]

1557
01:27:14.792 --> 01:27:15.792
Do you like sports?

1558
01:27:17.208 --> 01:27:20.042
Um. not really.

1559
01:27:20.958 --> 01:27:21.958
Okay.

1560
01:27:25.083 --> 01:27:26.083
Food?

1561
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:27.750
What?

1562
01:27:28.708 --> 01:27:32.917
Do you like food?

1563
01:27:34.375 --> 01:27:35.708
Do I like food?

1564
01:27:35.792 --> 01:27:39.042
Like. what's your favorite food?
What would your favorite food be?

1565
01:27:42.125 --> 01:27:43.417
I like-- I like pizza.

1566
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.250
-Oh.
-Uh. probably pizza.

1567
01:27:45.333 --> 01:27:46.333
Mm-hmm.

1568
01:27:47.583 --> 01:27:49.500
[sucks teeth]

1569
01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:55.792
Mmm. [groaning]

1570
01:27:56.292 --> 01:27:57.375
You don't like pizza?

1571
01:27:57.458 --> 01:27:59.625
I am lactose intolerant.

01:28:07.333 --> 01:28:08.333
I like veal.

1574
01:28:11.583 --> 01:28:12.583
Is it?

01:28:14.125 --> 01:28:15.125
Oh.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.833

1578
01:28:33.125 --> 01:28:34.125

01:28:35.875 --> 01:28:36.875
