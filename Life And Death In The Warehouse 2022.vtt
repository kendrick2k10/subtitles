so we don't set off the alarms.

That's not six inches. Alys Morgan.

19
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.920
Oh. shut up. That's not
six inches either. babe.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.880
no matter what that
lad told you last night.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.400
Nadia was saying she does
like 60-70 hours a week.

22
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.320
Some days. she's on
a fortnight. like flat.

23
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.480
Oh. my God. Hiya. Megan.

24
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.960
That is mental.

25
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.120
How are you?

26
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.160
Oh. my God. you're not working here.

27
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.200
First day. This is mental.

28
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.840
Lauren said she saw you in town.

29
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.600
I was like. "No way. she's
working in London or something."

30
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.560
So are you living at home? Yeah.

31
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.920
How's your brother?

32
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.920
Yeah. driving down
around the bend. you know?

33
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.440
But it's hard on his own. so.

34
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.760
Oh. I was so sad to
hear about your mum.

35
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.760
I loved her.

36
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.560
Yeah. um...

37
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.760
Yeah. you know. it's fine.
It is what it is.

38
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.600
Yeah. I'm so glad to see you.
Yeah. you too. This is Devon.

39
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.800
Dev. this is Megan.

40
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.920
We grew up on the same
street when I was a kid.

41
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.320
What was she like back in the day?

42
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.960
Oh. you know. loud.
always in bother.

43
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.960
I think every guy in
the estate fancied her.

44
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.800
Oh. shut up.

45
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.040
You can't go in in your coats.

46
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.480
You're going to have to put
them in your locker. Mine? Yeah.

47
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.360
In your lockers.

48
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.960
You can't take all of that in.
You have to leave it in your locker.

49
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.760
They said it'd be all right.
I got an email to show you.

50
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.880
Oh. go on. then. Thank you.

51
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.480
All right. There's loads of you...

52
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.560
How come you've got your phone?

53
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.360
They said it was all right. so.

54
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.760
That's weird. So do you know
where they're going to put you?

55
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.200
Picking. definitely. They're
always looking for pickers.

56
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.160
I'm actually on this. um.
like it's a fast track scheme thing.

57
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.720
Is it management?

58
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.800
Well. like training manager.

59
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.040
That's so cool! Oh. my God! Got
friends in high places. don't we?

60
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.160
I wouldn't call it that.

61
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.160
We'll see you in a bit then.
yeah? Yeah. Yeah.

62
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.800
Maybe we could catch up on break.

63
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.600
Yeah. I mean. I hardly get
any time. but I'll try.

64
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.720
See you later.

65
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.440
Tell me who's feeling good?!
Yeah!

66
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.920
Who's feeling great?

67
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.480
That's what I want to hear!

68
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.360
{\an8}This is Megan.
She's joining us today...

69
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.840
{\an8}THEY CHEER

70
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.080
..as a customer outcome supervisor!

71
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.080
And we all know how many
candidates she had to beat

72
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.480
to get to the position of the
coolest company in the world!

73
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.040
Megan. come up here.

74
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.600
Come on! You're one
of the chosen few now.

75
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.280
Chosen. chosen!
Got to remember to spend

76
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.640
that signing-on bonus.
You know the one. you know the one!

77
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.200
And my God. she's going to earn it!

78
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.200
It's overwhelming. right?

79
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.840
That was quite special.
Special place. special people.

80
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.360
Now you're one of
the special people.

81
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.520
OK? Great.

82
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.240
Now. you ready? Yeah.

83
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.040
Big moment. Mm-hm.

84
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.360
This is your team.

85
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.520
Pick. What are you
going to notice is

86
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.200
that yesterday their average
pick rate was 100 items an hour.

87
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.400
We like it to be 120. so
a pick every 30 seconds. Pick.

88
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.560
Obviously. we're going to need you
to resolve this as a first priority.

89
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.800
Analyse the metrics
of each associate.

90
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.840
locate the problem.
you solve that problem.

91
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.720
If someone's slowing down.
they're slowing down the team.

92
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.360
You need to help them improve that.

93
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.520
And if they can't speed up.
then you can have to off board them.

94
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.520
Which is super easy
if they're agency.

95
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.120
you just go to the temp desk and
tell Julie. and she'll get rid.

96
00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.600
Sharon. nothing tomorrow. Sorry.

97
00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.760
If they've got a green vest.

98
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.560
it means they're a
permanent member of staff.

99
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.120
so you have to go
through the process.

100
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.680
Green vests are like gold dust. If
this is a job they want to keep.

101
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.440
they'll listen. if not...

102
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.560
Now this is Alys Morgan.

103
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.320
Yesterday. her pick
rate wasn't good.

104
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.040
It was 99.

105
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.280
Pick. Is Alys agency?

106
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.160
No. she's green vest. so
you'll have to work with her

107
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.640
to get a pick right back up.
Just help us solve the problem.

108
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.400
Actually idle time is like six
minutes more than the team's
average.

109
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.280
Yeah. Yeah. I mean. she spent
11 a half minutes in the toilet.

110
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.480
Wait. you know how much time
she spent in the toilet?

111
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.120
Yeah. We know everything
about every associate.

112
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.160
I can't tell if
you're joking or not.

113
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.360
No. I'm not. I'm not joking.
Oh. OK. OK.

114
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.720
See. that's the point.

115
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.560
If we want to give the customers
what they want when they want it.

116
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.400
total commitment to
the metrics is key.

117
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.480
Proceed to X-0-0-1-

118
00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:01.320
Proceed to Y-0-0-1-

119
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.720
How was your date?
I did a wax.

120
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.080
Thank Christ.

121
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.920
I seen what you got down there.
Jon Snow wants his coat back.

122
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.960
You want to see? Go on.

123
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.840
Oh. I get some frozen peas on that.

124
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.080
Go to N-0—6-8-1-2-1-2.

125
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.320
Pick.

126
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.360
In the meantime. I'd like
to take the opportunity

127
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.880
to congratulate Nadia Ko...

128
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.240
Kovak.

129
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.040
Kovak. Kovak.

130
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.720
Good morning. everyone.
I'm Megan Roberts.

131
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.160
Ugh.

132
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.240
Hi. everyone.

133
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.280
I'm Megan.
I'm your new team leader.

134
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.560
{\an8}I know a couple of you already.

135
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.440
{\an8}but I'm sure I'll get to know
the rest of you very soon.

136
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.840
Looking forward to it.

137
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.200
Me too.

138
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.200
In the meantime. I'd like to take
the opportunity to congratulate

139
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.480
Nadia Kovak. who had the highest
pick rate on the team yesterday.

140
00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.040
Nadia. It's obvious that
Nadia has really been focusing

141
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.440
on her picking strategy.

142
00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.120
and that's paid off in
her exceeding her target.

143
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.720
So. as a team. if we
could look to her performance

144
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.880
and try and match that.
that'd be really brilliant.

145
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.400
OK. um. so yesterday. the
team's average was 100.

146
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.400
Uh. well. we would be looking for...

147
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.600
We would be looking for
it to be more like 120.

148
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.960
What?

149
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.400
Team members are spending a
bit more time in the toilets

150
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.000
than we would like.
and that's bringing the average...

151
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.160
Hang on a minute.

152
00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.120
What if I want to take a shit
in the toilet for ten minutes?

153
00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.560
Deb. don't.

154
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.200
Right. well. I mean. if we
could try and make it that

155
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.480
it didn't take ten minutes.
that's a good start.

156
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.240
Dump and run. is it?

157
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.720
It's just. it's really bringing...

158
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.360
it's bringing our team's average down.

159
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.520
and we really need to...

160
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.720
I've been working on P4.
Sorry. can you step forward?

161
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.880
I can't quite hear you.

162
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.960
If you're working on P4.
you expect us to scan an item.

163
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.120
go down to the toilet.
which is on P2 or P1.

164
00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.440
whichever toilet's available.

165
00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.120
and then go back and scan an item
in ten minutes? In ten minutes!

166
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.600
Have you worked in a factory
before. just out of curiosity?

167
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.360
Right. um. OK. so that was P4?

168
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.240
Yeah. and you expect me
to go down to the toilet... Yeah.

169
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.400
..and get back and scan
an item in ten minutes?

170
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.840
You're right. Julia.
Like you need to extend it.

171
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.640
OK. well. um. what's
your name. sorry?

172
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.520
Julia. Julia. thank you
for bringing that up.

173
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.680
It's my first day. I don't
quite know the floor plan.

174
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.880
but I'll definitely look
into that and get back to you.

175
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.200
So thank you for bringing that up.

176
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.040
It takes ten minutes to get
to the toilet and...

177
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.440
You know. Nadia's just
been doing really well.

178
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.800
so if Nadia you can do it.

179
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.760
then maybe the rest
of us could do it.

180
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.920
Favourites.

181
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.040
Um...

182
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.920
OK. the next bit of good news is
that there's overtime.

183
00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.440
That's everything. so
thank you for listening.

184
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.280
and. um. yeah. have a good day.

185
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.080
Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. OK.

186
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.240
That was so nerve-racking.

187
00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.400
Oh. my god. I know.

188
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.720
Listen. they were
being harsh on you. like.

189
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.920
don't worry about it.

190
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.880
They're lush. they are lush.
Loud. aren't they? Yeah.

191
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.640
Look. I'm sorry. mate. though.
I can't do the overtime.

192
00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.600
Oh. you know you have to.

193
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.480
Yeah. I know. and honestly. I could
do with the extra money. but I...

194
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.080
Look. Alys. your pick
rate's already really low.

195
00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.160
So... Yeah.

196
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.080
It's just. it's a
medical thing. though.

197
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.680
I can't change it. Right. um...

198
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.640
..all right. yeah. of course.
yeah. no problem.

199
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.440
Thank you so much.
You're a life-saver.

200
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.480
I'm so glad you're here. like...

201
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:31.200
OK. I'll see you later. Yeah.
And we'll have that catch up. Yeah.

202
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.840
OK. thank you. Bye.

203
00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.640
Congratulations.
Nadia Kovac. leading pick rate.

204
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.720
Do you two know each other?

205
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.960
She's got a medical appointment.
so she can't do the overtime.

206
00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.280
but she's going to do
her ten hours. so.

207
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.440
We do 60 hour weeks. Megan. it's
not like we're asking associates

208
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.840
to do long shifts that
we wouldn't do ourselves.

209
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.360
It's just cos it's a
medical appointment that.

210
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.800
is that not different?

211
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.440
I think it's also important
that if you're showing favouritism

212
00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.880
to someone you've got a relationship
with... Yes. exactly.

213
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.040
..it doesn't show well
with the rest of the associates.

214
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.160
We want to pull together
just to hit these targets.

215
00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.720
Yeah. of course. But just...
Yeah. yeah. it makes total sense.

216
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.640
Yeah? Yeah. thanks. Thanks. Megan.

217
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.920
Thank you.

218
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.800
Avoid excessive idle time.

219
00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.720
Oh. All right?

220
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.840
Um. You all right? Yeah. I'm good.

221
00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.240
I just. um. I was just
going to ask you. um.

222
00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.840
if you wanted to come to
the pub after work tonight?

223
00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.400
There's a bunch of us going.

224
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.520
like. Beth's going. and um...

225
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.720
Yeah? ..and Brian. I just...
Yeah. I would love to.

226
00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.400
I just can't tonight cos I've just
got this thing that. like... Oh.

227
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.280
like. I just... Yeah. no.
..rearranged it.

228
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.480
Yeah. it's fine.
Proceed to next pick.

229
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.920
What are you laughing at?

230
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.440
I'm not laughing. You are. No.

231
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.800
Making it up. go ahead.
Why should I if I'm not. It's fine.

232
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.200
Just. I'll. um. yeah.
just do it another time.

233
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.360
Yeah. of course.

234
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.920
Time for next pick.

235
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.160
All right. Yeah. See you later.

236
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.280
All right. bye.

237
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.480
What are you laughing at?
I've got to go to next pick.

238
00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.760
That's OK. I'll see you in a bit.
Bye. All right. see you.

239
00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.640
{\an8}We do not
believe trade unions

240
00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.440
{\an8}are in the best
interests for our customers.

241
00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.480
{\an8}What's more. we value a
direct one-to-one relationship

242
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.200
with all our associates.

243
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.920
Anything that comes
in the way of that

244
00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.120
is likely to damage our
customer fixated culture.

245
00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.640
As a new recruit. you'll learn
about the early warning signs

246
00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.680
of union activity.

247
00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.720
Things to look out
for include associates

248
00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.120
not normally connected to
each other holding meetings

249
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.720
and an excessive
focus on workers' rights.

250
00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.160
If you spot anything you suspect
to be union activity.

251
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.120
please contact our
department immediately.

252
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:36.400

255
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.120
Pick.

256
00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.640
Avoid excessive idle time.

257
00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.400
Morning. morning. Morning.

258
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.600
Megan. Alys Morgan didn't want
to do any overtime last night?

259
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.120
Any thoughts? Yeah. she
had a medical appointment.

260
00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.360
Which is fine. you know. people
have got to go to the doctor's.

261
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.320
But if you're an associate short.

262
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.760
it's not going to help
your team with the pick rate.

263
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.000
Yeah. no. no.

264
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.640
I was totally wrong. My mistake.
I'm really sorry.

265
00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.400
There's no mistakes.
There's no mistakes at all.

266
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.640
Just the associates don't
tell us when they can work

267
00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.520
and when they can't.
Yeah. completely.

268
00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.560
Thanks. I'll make a note of it.

269
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.640
Yeah. Yeah. thanks.

270
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.520
You've should seen the
fucking burger she had last night.

271
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.240
The thing is. after a couple.
you've got to have some food. Yeah.

272
00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.800
Do you know what I mean?

273
00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.600
Nads. you all right?

274
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.960
You all right? You're sweating.

275
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.200
You going to get through
the shift all right?

276
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.200
Mm. I've had few of these. You can
have some of these. if you want.

277
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:42.680
You're being a druggie.
Drug dealer. more like.

278
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.200
Energy tablet.

279
00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.880
It's not like I'm
going to be serving up

280
00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.560
mandies in the
middle of a canteen.

281
00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.800
How many? As many you want.
they're just natural energy tablets.

282
00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.640
Don't tell her that.
she'll take the whole bag.

283
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.320
Oh. you took like. Nads.
you took way too many of them!

284
00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.400
Then I have to.

285
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.160
Your pick rate's
going to be like 250.

286
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.480
It's already high. you don't...
It has to be 250.

287
00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.200
You don't...
She's on a mission. you.

288
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.400
You're desperate for
the green vest. aren't you?

289
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.280
Yes. You look so much better.
I feel better.

290
00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.480
Yeah. She does. that's good.

291
00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.760
Um. hi. sorry. Hi. You all right?

292
00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.320
Can I have a word?
Yeah. yeah. of course.

293
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.720
Sure. Um... We'll leave. We'll go.

294
00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.080
All right.

295
00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.960
Big night out last night. was it?

296
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.840
You're joking. ain't you?
I was in bed for ten. I was.

297
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.440
What. 10pm?

298
00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:31.680
Yeah. I mean. once upon a time.
10am would've been early for you.

299
00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.280
I know. God. remember.

300
00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.800
Things change.

301
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.560
Um. I just needed to
talk to you about something.

302
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.800
Um...

303
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.080
So. it's not your fault.

304
00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.960
it was my mistake. but.

305
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.040
I got it in the neck
yesterday about the overtime.

306
00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.360
Oh. fuck. I'm so sorry.
No. it's not your fault.

307
00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.480
And I told them it
was a medical thing. and...

308
00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.280
Yeah. it was. Yeah. no.
I totally believe you. um...

309
00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.440
But. yeah. they weren't
really having any of it.

310
00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.800
And yeah. just like going forwards.

311
00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.920
I-I won't be able to. like.

312
00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.160
I-I can't let you off
doing the overtime.

313
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.040
You know what it is. Meg?

314
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.400
Um. I'm pregnant.

315
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.240
Yeah. that's why I
couldn't do the overtime

316
00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.320
cos I had a medical appointment at
the hospital. see the doctor.

317
00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.760
Yeah. Oh. congratulations!
I mean. is it congratulations?

318
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.400
Oh. yeah. I'm chuffed. I'm
really happy. You look really happy.

319
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.160
It wasn't planned. like.
believe me. Right. sure. But. um...

320
00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.200
Yeah. no. I'm happy.
Oh. my God. I'm so shocked.

321
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.000
Yeah. right? In a good way.
It's lush.

322
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.040
Yeah! I'm going to be a mum.
You're going to be!

323
00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.440
Can you believe it? Oh. my God.
So much has changed.

324
00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.680
Is Devon the dad?
Oh. my God. Shut up! No!

325
00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:33.920
What?! What!

326
00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.120
No. he's just... What?

327
00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.520
You two are really close.

328
00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.680
Are you two not together?

329
00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.120
No. he's just a mate.

330
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.240
Aw. yeah. he's a good mate.

331
00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.160
No. I mean...
I've not even told him yet.

332
00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.840
He is smitten.
You can see from miles off.

333
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.520
Stop it.

334
00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.920
So who is the dad?

335
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.680
Oh. gosh. do you remember.

336
00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.680
don't judge. Kayden Robinson?

337
00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.720
I know. it's hard to
forget him. I know.

338
00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.720
Do I remember Kayden Ro...mm.

339
00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.080
Do I remember? Oh. my God.
Yeah. He's the dad?!

340
00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.360
Well. at least they're going
to be good looking. right?

341
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.600
My God. that's amazing.
Do you know what you're having?

342
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.240
A girl. Oh! I know. I'm chuffed.

343
00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.920
And is everything all right?
Well. I went to the doctor.

344
00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.600
and he said she's growing well.

345
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.120
and I heard a little
heartbeat. which was lush.

346
00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.360
But he said that my
blood pressure's high

347
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.560
and that I should avoid doing
lots of exercise or heavy lifting.

348
00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.880
And I was like. mate. you
do know I work. don't you?

349
00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:29.080
I literally walk 17 miles a day.
half the time on oversize.

350
00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.600
so I'm a bit worried about that.
and he's giving me a note.

351
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.360
Do you think you
could get me reassigned?

352
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.560
Honestly. I wouldn't ask.
but the doctor was. like...

353
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.320
No. totally. That makes...yeah.
of course.

354
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.000
Thank you so much.
It makes so much sense now.

355
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.520
Um. Right.

356
00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.760
I mean. I can't guarantee it.
but I'll absolutely ask.

357
00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.400
Don't tell anyone. like... I mean.
I'll have to tell the manager.

358
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.760
I think I'll have to tell
management. Oh. yeah. Is that OK?

359
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.200
Yeah. whatever you need to do.

360
00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.280
I mean. I'm really
honoured you told me.

361
00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.800
and I promise to keep the secret.

362
00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.240
Thank you so much. Right.
Congratulations. See you later.

363
00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.400
Thank you.

364
00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.560
See you in a bit. See you. babe.

365
00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.800
Today's leading pick rate.
average 147 this hour.

366
00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.880
Did you grass on me
about the overtime?

367
00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.560
I used the management feedback tool

368
00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.400
to let Danny know
that Alys didn't stay. yeah.

369
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.120
Right.

370
00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.160
It's literally what it's there for.

371
00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.280
What. you don't think
criticising colleagues anonymously

372
00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.640
is a bit. well. out of order?

373
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.720
I was concerned that you
were trying to do the easy thing.

374
00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:38.440
rather than the thing
that was best for your team.

375
00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:43.040
Every failure is an opportunity
to become more customer-fixated.

376
00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.880
If you see anything
I could be doing better.

377
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.560
than flag it up on the system.

378
00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.120
I'd expect you to.

379
00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.960
Yeah. Cool. Thanks.

380
00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.200
Stay customer-fixated.

381
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.840
Bloke on my team's pick rate's shit.

382
00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.960
Oh. right. What are
you going to do about it.

383
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:03.480
because I really need some
advice on how to help Alys.

384
00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.840
I don't know.

385
00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.520
Craig's shoulder's a mess.

386
00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.040
It happens a lot. to be honest.

387
00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:13.080
Really? It's just all the
picking. it's relentless.

388
00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.000
Well. why don't you just
speak to Danny and see

389
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.840
if you can put him on
sick leave or something?

390
00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.120
Danny knows all about it.

391
00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.000
That's just not how
things work around here.

392
00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.520
I really appreciate this.
thank you. Uh-huh.

393
00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.120
This one's turned down quite a few
shifts in the last few months.

394
00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.240
Do you know why?
And today's pick rate is crap.

395
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.560
Wouldn't be offering him a
shift tomorrow. if I were you.

396
00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:36.320
This one in your team? Cos he can't
hack it anymore. believe me. OK.

397
00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.760
This one's definitely yours.
though. terrible pick rate.

398
00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.240
Shame she's permanent. Alys is
a really good worker. though.

399
00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.920
so I think I'll keep her...
Used to be.

400
00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.360
Pick rate 82. should be 120.

401
00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.320
Lucky for her. she
got that green vest.

402
00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:52.040
Yes. in tomorrow. See you then.

403
00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.920
Yeah. you've got a shift tomorrow.
Pick up the pick rate. though.

404
00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.560
Just about. All right?
See you then. Rachel.

405
00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.120
Nothing tomorrow. Rachel. sorry.

406
00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.960
What about the day after?
I have no idea.

407
00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.920
Keep an eye on your phone. yeah?
I know it works.

408
00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.080
What about next week?
I couldn't tell you. Phone. yeah?

409
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.440
Eve. yeah. back tomorrow.
Skin of your teeth.

410
00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.040
Check your phone. pick up your
rates. That's all I can tell you.

411
00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.520
Time to look for something else.
yeah?

412
00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.640
If you kept working hard.
you'd be back in tomorrow.

413
00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.520
Nothing tomorrow.
keep an eye on your phone.

414
00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.520
Got a long line here. yeah?
Keep it moving. Come forward.

415
00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.560
{\an8}You're back tomorrow. Nadia.

416
00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.120
{\an8}And you're back tomorrow.

417
00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.760
What's she saying?
She loves this place.

418
00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.560
All right.

419
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.800
Mate. do you know
how minging that is?

420
00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:47.920
Perving on me. Please. just go
to the lav like a proper human.

421
00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.400
Got to stay customer-fixated.
babe. you know this.

422
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.000
Mate. get rid of that in case
they pick it and send it to someone.

423
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.880
So we've got an
average team rate of...

424
00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.520
..121. I'm really happy
with that. Yeah? Yeah.

425
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.480
Apart from...could do better.

426
00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.720
Yeah. OK. absolutely.
Work on that. Yep. absolutely.

427
00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:08.160
Same can be said with
Craig on your team. Sean.

428
00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.680
And I can't believe I'm
asking this question again!

429
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.120
I mean. I'm concerned about it.

430
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.600
I'm concerned. It's frustrating.

431
00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.320
I've had the one
conversation with Craig.

432
00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.120
but I will talk to him again.
I think we'll get that rate

433
00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.320
back to where it should be.

434
00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.760
Yeah? Yeah. OK.

435
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.240
So I had a chat with Alys.

436
00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.200
and I got to the bottom of
why her pick rate's so low.

437
00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.120
Yeah. 89 today.

438
00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.440
Yeah. So. it's. well. it
turns out she's pregnant.

439
00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:38.720
So I was thinking the best way
forward would be to reassign her.

440
00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.520
I thought we could put
her on packing.

441
00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.240
She could. if she
was trained in packing.

442
00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.320
which is a shame. because she's not.

443
00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.440
No. but. um. we could
sort that out for her.

444
00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.160
I was thinking.

445
00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.800
I'm just... I'm a little bit
concerned that you're not committed

446
00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.080
to raising your
team's pick rate. Megan.

447
00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.800
No. I am committed. Great.
I'm really committed.

448
00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.360
That's why I've come up with
the solution of packing.

449
00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.520
That just seems like
the best way forward.

450
00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.800
Um...

451
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.760
I don't think it's a solution... Mm.

452
00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.720
..because you can't really pass
your problems onto another team.

453
00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.880
Yeah. but she's got a doctor's note.

454
00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.400
so I feel like I have to...

455
00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.520
..I need to do something to
help her. Of course. Yes.

456
00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:23.720
Of course. We need to
do something to help her.

457
00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.640
Mm-hm. Just throwing it
out there. suggestion.

458
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.480
you fire in with whatever you think.

459
00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:32.440
I'm saying personal
enhancement plan for Alys.

460
00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.280
Agreed. Yeah? Absolutely.
yeah. Yeah?

461
00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.040
You can deliver this. Megan.
get that pick rate right back up

462
00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.720
to where it should be. Yeah.

463
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.360
It's just that I feel like
she's not really going to improve

464
00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.680
because she's not going
to be able. you know.

465
00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.240
it's just going to get worse.
As a team. you help her.

466
00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.000
she helps you.
the two of you help us.

467
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.240
We all help each other. Yes.

468
00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.920
Can you handle it? Definitely.

469
00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.760
Yeah. thanks. OK. Great.

470
00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.440
Great. great. great. great. great.

471
00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.720

It's lush. Yeah.

477
00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.040
I broke it. It's all right.

478
00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.720
Have a little bit. No. you have it.

479
00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.560
I don't want it. It's for you.
Share. It's for you.

480
00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.320
No. it's for you. I want to
share it. I just had a sandwich.

481
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.240
Give me the wrapper.

482
00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.720
Thank you.

483
00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:32.960
Cheers.

Al. I'm serious. I can't.

Hi. Alys? Can I borrow
you for a minute?

494
00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.280
Hang on a second.

495
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.520
OK. So. you know that thing you
told me. that your doctor said?

496
00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:10.160
Yeah. Well. I asked to get you
reassigned. Oh. thank God.

497

Thank you. I could bloody kiss you.
Yeah. the thing is.

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.960
{\an8}We've just got to get
your pick rate back up.

501
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:24.520
{\an8}Right. So. I've put together this
personal enhancement plan for you.

502
00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.120
{\an8}FAINT HEADSET CHATTER

503
00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.320
I don't know what that is.
What's that?

504
00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.480
OK. so. um.

505
00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.400
OK. I'll show you.

506
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.400
I've noticed that you can
be a bit slow in between...

507
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.600
in between picks sometimes.

508
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:43.600
And if you pull a little
bit more at this pace.

509
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:47.160
that'd really help to get
your pick rate back up. Right.

510
00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.800
And you bend your back
quite a bit. and. actually.

511
00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:53.440
if you bend your knees like this.

512
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.000
when you're picking stuff
up off the bottom shelf.

513
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
that would be better for
your back and quicker.

514
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.600
Megan. I'm not trying
to offend you or nothing.

515
00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.440
but I have worked here
for over a year. like.

516
00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.040
I know how to pace myself.

517
00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.400
I know. It's my neck
on the block here.

518
00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.840
I've only been here two minutes.

519
00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.920
We just need to get
your pick rate back up.

520
00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.800
We need to prove to them that we
can do that and you can get better.

521
00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.360
I-I'm honestly not
trying to cause trouble.

522
00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.440
I just...my doctor said
I shouldn't be doing this.

523
00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.400
so I've been stressed. Yeah.

524
00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.520
Well. if you could just
try and implement the things

525
00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.280
I've shown to you. that might help.

526
00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.320
All right.

527
00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.280
Could you? Yeah.

528
00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.280
OK. Great. Thank you. Thanks.

529
00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:40.080
{\an8}Go to Y-0-3-

543
00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.800
{\an8}Are you trying to get me sacked?

544
00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.240
{\an8}You know your rate's below 100.
Just feeling a bit dizzy.

545
00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.520
{\an8}Just give me a sec.

546
00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.760
{\an8}Al.

547
00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:49.160
{\an8}Alys. just please
just get up... Alys?

548
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.640
{\an8}Alys?

549
00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.280
{\an8}Alys. you all right?

550
00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.160
{\an8}Time for
next pick exceeded. Al?

551
00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.560
{\an8}Alys? Al?

552
00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.200
{\an8}Ambulance!
SHE SPEAKS POLISH

553
00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.600
{\an8}Yeah. ambulance. please. Alys?

554
00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.200
Alys Morgan collapsed.
Megan called her an ambulance.

555
00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.560
Megan. love. why
did you call an ambulance?

556
00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:17.440
We need to just talk about this
and see where you went wrong.

557
00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.240
Just an associate collapsed and...

558
00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:23.040
That's going to be
a bit of a problem.

559
00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.480
Concerns have
been raised over safety

560
00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:29.920
at a distribution centre after it
was revealed at least 105 ambulances

561
00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:33.680
have been called to the site
over a three-year period.

562
00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:38.240
That compares to 17 call outs
to a nearby supermarket warehouse

563
00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.640
over the same period.

564
00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:43.040
We contacted the centre. but
managers have declined to comment.

565
00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.760
So you thought of yourself
and one member of your team.

566
00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.360
but you. do you feel that you've
let the rest of your team down?

567
00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:51.680
She needed medical attention. The
easy decision isn't always the best.

568
00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:54.680
Mm-hm. You could have referred...
Yes. absolutely. ..to the first aid.

569
00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.240
Yes. But this is a real
opportunity for growth.

570
00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:00.040
the real learning curve. Absolutely.
a real teachable moment here.

571
00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.720
We are here to support you
all the way. Absolutely.

572
00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.680
{\an8}Personal electronic
devices are not permitted...

573
00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.040
Yeah. you're on shift. Go on in.

574
00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.280
Yeah? Yeah. All right.

575
00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.440
Hey. Julie. Ryan Andrews.

576
00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:22.920
You're not needed today.

577
00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.320
But I got a text to come in.

578
00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.320
Yeah. I know. things have
changed. unfortunately.

579
00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.360
Just keep coming forward.

580
00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.120
It cost me six quid in bus fare to
get here. It took me over an hour.

581
00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.680
Sorry. I don't know what to say.
there's nothing in for you today.

582
00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.480
Can you not have a
chat with the team leader

583
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.560
cos he knows how good I am.
I'm good at picking...

584
00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.120
You know that's not
how we work. yeah?

585
00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.320
There's no shifts for you today.
I can do nothing more.

586
00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.880
I understand. I'm already here.
though. so like if I'm here...

587
00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.240
I understand that. but I can't
let you through those gates.

588
00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.400
Beth won't let you through.
cos there is no shift for you today.

589
00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.680
Yeah? I need the money. please.
I understand that.

590
00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.160
so does everyone on the floor.

591
00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.600
They've got shifts. you haven't.

592
00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.120
That's just the way it is.

593
00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.760
Just keep coming forward.

594
00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:01.920
You're better off just getting
your cellphone. wait on a text.

595
00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.960
Avoid excessive idle time.

596
00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.880
{\an8}HEADSET PLAYS IN POLISH

597
00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.800
Pick.

598
00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.440
Hey. you all right?

599
00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.200
I was calling you all night.
Karina said you fainted.

600
00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.480
Huh? Yeah.

601
00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.680
Oh. man. you got to take
these breaks. like. Right.

602
00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.480
Your sugars are going
to drop and. yeah? Yeah.

603
00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.440
Look after yourself.

604
00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.960
It's not Dev.

605
00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.640
Hey. what's wrong?

606
00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.040
Um. I need to tell you something.

607
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.960
Yeah?

608
00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.880
You can tell me anything.
you know that.

609
00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.280
I'm pregnant.

610
00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.200
I...I I've been
wanting to tell you.

611
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.920
Who's...who's the dad. eh?

612
00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:07.800
Oh. it don't matter. some
dickhead I know from school.

613
00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:13.360
I'm so sorry. Dev.
I wanted to tell you for...

614
00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.440
Don't fucking follow me.
I'm serious. like!

615
00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.000
I should've told you.
I know! I'm sorry.

616
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.720
Devon. can you just stop?

617
00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.360
Please don't make me run.

618
00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.720
I should've told you. and I feel
like an idiot. Who's is it?

619
00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.800
Tell me. who is it?
Dev. it really doesn't matter.

620
00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.000
What's his name? Fuck. I
guess I've been the last told.

621
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.040
No. you haven't. that's
what I'm saying. please.

622
00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.240
Yeah. I have been. though.
I bet everybody else knows.

623
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.120
I feel like a fucking idiot.

624
00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:41.160
Some of them know.
hardly anyone. Who knows?

625
00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.040
Nadia. Oh. fuck! Please. don't...
I got to go.

626
00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:46.720
It's breaking my heart
to see you upset. Dev. please.

627
00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.360
I've been an idiot.
I'm taking the...

628
00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.440
..I'm completely
taking the blame. OK?

629
00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.840
It's my fault. I should've said...
Do me a favour. yeah?

630
00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:55.040
Delete my number. and never
fucking talk to me again.

631
00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.920
Don't be like that. Dev.
I'm serious!

632
00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.560
Why are you crying?
Cos you're upset.

633
00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.440
Why are YOU crying?
I didn't want to upset you.

634
00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:02.440
Oh. fuck. man.

635
00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:03.880
Fuck.

636
00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:10.520
Megan. yesterday. an ambulance
was called to the centre.

637
00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.040
Yeah. Alys Morgan fainted.

638
00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.720
And. I mean. do you think
it was really necessary

639
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.320
to bring the
emergency services here?

640
00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.120
I mean. it was an emergency.

641
00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:21.360
Did you panic?

642
00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:26.160
Mm. well. I was scared for
Alys because of her condition.

643
00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:28.560
Yeah. of course. No. understandable.

644
00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:30.400
But that's why the policy's there.

645
00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.840
The policy's there to protect
you. to protect Alys.

646
00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.000
to protect the team.

647
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.960
You bring the first aiders over.

648
00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:39.000
They're trained. they assess
the situation. they decide.

649
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.360
You don't just...go
straight for an ambulance.

650
00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:44.400
I just tried to do what I
thought was best at the time.

651
00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:48.640
I mean. she was out cold.
Megan. we're a team. OK?

652
00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:52.320
I don't think it's helpful
for you to be defensive.

653
00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.240
I'm not being defensive.

654
00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:58.920
We can all benefit about talking
about our mistakes.. Mm-hm.

655
00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.200
..me included. Mm-hm.

656
00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.920
Yeah. I totally agree. I...

657
00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:07.320
..I don't quite understand how
calling the ambulance was a mistake.

658
00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.480
Thank you for your honesty.

659
00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:15.480
Megan. would you say that
you take the easiest route

660
00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.960
or what's best for the team?

661
00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.320
I always try to
think about the team.

662
00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.440
OK. And your friendship with Alys.

663
00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.280
the fact that you're
so close with Alys.

664
00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:27.280
do you think that maybe
that clouded your judgment.

665
00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.040
got in the way. made you emotional.

666
00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.400
and stopped you from
putting the team first?

667
00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.480
We're not even close. OK.

668
00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.760
Honestly.

669
00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.400
We used to live on the same street.

670
00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.520
I've barely seen her the last
few years. That's the truth.

671
00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:43.680
So why haven't you dealt
with her pick rate yet?

672
00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.000
I have dealt with it.

673
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.720
I delivered the personal enhancement
plan like you asked me to.

674
00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:51.240
And yet. her idle time is one
of the highest in the centre.

675
00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.400
Yeah. 26 minutes.

676
00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:56.040
And her pick rate
one of the lowest. 87.

677
00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:59.120
87. and we'd like it to be...

678
00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:06.560
Megan. I say this from a warm place.

679
00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:10.520
but maybe you need to have a think
about whether you're happy here.

680
00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:15.720
Mm-hm. As great as this place is.
it isn't for everyone.

681
00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:20.080
We all can't make the cut.
and that's the truth.

682
00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:22.400
Um...

683
00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:25.120
Maybe. maybe I did make a
mistake in calling the ambulance.

684
00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.160
Maybe?

685
00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.840
Definitely. Definitely. OK.

686
00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.280
I definitely made a mistake.

687
00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.280
I panicked like. like
you said. I panicked.

688
00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.600
OK. But I can do better.

689
00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.400
I can definitely do better. Mm-hm.

690
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.160
Um. I can...

691
00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:44.760
...I can try and be calmer
in situations like that.

692
00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.600
Great. great. What else do
you think you could do better?

693
00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.720
So. I-I could...

694
00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:57.080
...um. s-sorry. I. um...

695
00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.520
Do you think you could
be more customer-fixated?

696
00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.760
Yes. Yeah. That's great.

697
00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:06.480
Great. because some of the comments
on the management feedback tool

698
00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:11.360
suggest a concern that
you're not on the same page

699
00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.800
as those with regards
to customer fixation.

700
00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.040
Wha...who said that?

701
00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.960
You know that's anonymous.

702
00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.720
And it doesn't matter.
It's irrelevant.

703
00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:22.520
What does matter is that
we're grateful for the feedback

704
00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:24.320
from any source. right?
Absolutely. I am.

705
00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:27.320
I'm completely open to all feedback.

706
00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:32.440
Good. Cos we need to be
desperate to please our customers.

707
00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.480
I am. I'm 100% desperate.

708
00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:37.760
100%? 110. I'm 110 desperate.

709
00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.560
110% desperate to
please our customers.

710
00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:47.040
Which involves listening to whatever
is said about us... Mm-hm.

711
00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.120
..from whoever. Mm? Mm-hm.

712
00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:52.240
My ears are always open. Always.

713
00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:58.560
Yes. so maybe I don't enjoy
being talked about. but I...

714
00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.080
This is good. this is honesty.

715
00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:01.400
Yeah. yeah. Good. What else?

716
00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.160
..totally understand
that I need to...

717
00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.640
..um. sorry...

718
00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:07.960
..I need to...

719
00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:12.360
..um. get over that so
that I can better myself

720
00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.920
and challenge myself.

721
00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:16.640
And that's where we come in.
and we will support you

722
00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.040
with whatever you need.

723
00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.920
We'll put anything in place
if that's what you want.

724
00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.200
That's why we're here.

725
00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.720
Yeah. yeah. definitely.

726
00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.560
What do you need from us?

727
00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:30.680
I need you to help me.
so I can be better.

728
00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.160
And when you get better...

729
00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.640
Um...

730
00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.160
..we-we're all better.

731
00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:16.600
Where you off?

732
00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:19.080
They've off boarded me.

733
00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:21.400
What? Why?

734
00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:24.800
Because I didn't give Craig
the last warning. did I?

735
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.360
I just couldn't do it.

736
00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.440
Which was stupid cos
they'll get rid of him anyway.

737
00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.480
so then we'll both be unemployed.

738
00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.200
I'm really sorry.

739
00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.000
Well. look after yourself. Meg.

740
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.600
Don't let them turn you
into someone you don't like.

741
00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:47.440
Any problems on shift?

742
00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.720
We need to keep an eye on
the number of incorrect picks.

743
00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.440
Just make sure everyone's
double-checking those QR codes.

744
00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:56.280
Oh. I had a new associate
who was slipping under target.

745
00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:57.600
so off boarded him.

746
00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.360
Alys Morgan's pick
rate is still low.

747
00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:04.160
but I'm working with
her on that. so. Still?

748
00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.440
I think time for
a disciplinary. Mm-hm.

749
00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:11.040
And we need to off board Craig.
I can do that.

750
00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:14.400
No. no. no. no. no.
No. I think Megan should do it.

751
00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.680
Sorry. you want me to do that now?

752
00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:19.280
Yeah. You'll find him in oversize.

753
00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.600
Hello. stranger! All right?

754
00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.920
Barely seen recently. they
still got you run off your feet?

755
00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:00.720
Sorry. love.

756
00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.880
You know my sign-on bonus? Yeah.

757
00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.600
How much was left?

758
00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.600
Don't know exactly.

759
00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.200
Round about. Dad?

760
00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.760
Well we had to get the boiler fixed.

761
00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:16.400
your brother needed
new school shoes.

762
00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.040
Right.

763
00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.000
Not much. then.

764
00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.400
What's the matter. love?

765
00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.360
Nothing just. um...

766
00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.720
..shattered.

767
00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:35.160
I've got to go. but. um.
I'll speak to you later. OK?

768
00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:00.280
{\an8}Right?

769
00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.760
I didn't think you were
even speaking to me.

770
00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.400
You need a union rep for this. Al.

771
00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.040
Oh. no. Dev. you can't. No.

772
00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:19.000
I appreciate it. but as soon
as they know you're in the union.

773
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.440
they will make your life
a misery. Yeah. I know.

774
00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.960
I can't have you losing
your job over me. Dev.

775
00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:26.200
Al. I've thought about it.

776
00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:29.760
This is a disciplinary meeting

777
00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:32.680
following your lack
of performance on the pick team.

778
00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:35.800
And anything you say
will go in your file.

779
00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.320
It's your right to be accompanied.

780
00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.680
and I can see you've brought
Devon here for support.

781
00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:43.840
I'm here in my capacity as
a trade union representative.

782
00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:46.480
I'm sorry you felt the need
to involve the union. Alys.

783
00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.360
It's not that
we're against the union.

784
00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.520
it's just that we prefer
more of a one-to-one

785
00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:52.240
approach with our associates.

786
00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:55.760
So why's there two of you here then?

787
00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:01.600
You'll recall previous discussions
where we looked at your idle time.

788
00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.600
This is 12:06 on 11th of November.

789
00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:08.040
and you'll see your toilet
break lasted nine minutes.

790
00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:11.080
Yeah. well. I'm pregnant.
You know this.

791
00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:15.320
And here's your second break.
which lasted 11 minutes.

792
00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:18.160
Can you explain why it
took an extra two minutes?

793
00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.880
Megan. she just said. like...

794
00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.520
I literally. I
don't know what to say.

795
00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:23.760
I mean. how long am
I supposed to take?

796
00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:26.360
I mean. am I supposed
to stop mid-flow because. like.

797
00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.600
my bladder's not up to that
at the minute. if I'm honest.

798
00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:33.160
Here's a shift three days later
with an idle period of 12 minutes.

799
00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.560
Do want to listen before you
just go on to the next one. like?

800
00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:37.880
I'm not being funny. it's like
this is why the whole place

801
00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.520
is littered with bottles of pee.

802
00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.520
Are you aware of this? I-I...

803
00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.760
No-one wants to go to the
lav cos they're terrified

804
00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:45.120
of buggering their pick rates

805
00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:47.240
and have you guys breathing
down their neck? Yeah.

806
00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:49.080
I mean. you've been
aware of the situation

807
00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.160
for such a long time. like.
it's not the first time

808
00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:52.760
we've brought this up.
So many times!

809
00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:55.440
Right. but clearly not all your time
off task is spent in the toilet

810
00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:59.200
because this conversation
lasted two minutes 33 seconds.

811
00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:01.440
So what were you talking about? God.

812
00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:05.160
I don't know. do I?

813
00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.360
Right. so it wasn't
about a work issue?

814
00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:09.640
I said I don't know.
I have no idea.

815
00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:15.720
Any time off task. any conversation
not work related. is idle time.

816
00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:20.360
And we've calculated that your
average time off task per day

817
00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:21.760
is 23 minutes.

818
00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:25.120
Conversations that are lasting
two minutes 33 seconds...

819
00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.560
I can't believe you're timing me.

820
00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:28.680
..should not be non-work-related
conversations.

821
00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:30.760
Let me get this straight.
so you're telling me

822
00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:34.360
I can't go to the toilet. We're not
saying you can't go to toilet. Alys.

823
00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:36.160
It sounds like it.
I told you I'm pregnant!

824
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.160
Every single one of us needs
to be desperate to please.

825
00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:42.000
We need to be desperate
to please. We need...

826
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.920
We need to be fixated
on our customers 24/7.

827
00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:47.840
Right. let me let me explain to you.
cos probably you don't understand.

828
00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:49.680
Right. when I'm at work. right?

829
00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:53.440
I can walk for hours and hours
without speaking to anyone at all.

830
00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:56.480
That's the job. right? Miles and
miles without even seeing a soul.

831
00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.840
So when I do see a mate.
I feel like saying hello.

832
00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.640
cos all I've got is the
headset going off in my ear.

833
00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.720
And if I say hello to a mate.
it makes me feel better.

834
00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:06.080
I can carry on for the next
four or five. six. seven hours!

835
00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:08.760
There's saying hello. then
there's... Really fucking hard work.

836
00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:11.000
..having conversations for...
Sorry for swearing.

837
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.480
..to minutes 33
seconds to say hello?!

838
00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:15.760
Look. right. Alys has been
a fucking brilliant picker

839
00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:18.440
ever since she got here. That's
why she was given a green vest.

840
00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:20.760
The team's average is
way down because of Alys.

841
00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:22.200
Because she's fucking pregnant!

842
00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.080
I'm not a robot. Megan.
Listen. you know what?

843
00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:25.680
I'm pregnant!
I'm so confused. like.

844
00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:28.200
Are you going to sack
me cos I'm pregnant?

845
00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.320
The Equality Act 2010. Section 18.

846
00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.800
makes it unlawful to
discriminate against a colleague

847
00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.400
on the grounds of
them being pregnant.

848
00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:38.840
Nobody is being discriminated
against because they're pregnant.

849
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.840
That's bullshit. like.
It's all right. Dev.

850
00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:44.160
I'm sorry you feel that way. Yeah.

851
00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:47.800
You're going to need to calm down.

852
00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.760
Have you been looking out
for the early warning signs

853
00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:01.080
of union activity
on your team. Megan?

854
00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.120
Yeah. of course.

855
00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:05.640
I don't know how I missed it.

856
00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.800
You're going to need to
tell security ops everything.

857
00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:12.240
They'll start monitoring
Devon's social media.

858
00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:14.960
In the meantime.
if he puts a foot wrong.

859
00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:17.280
you record him for disciplinary.

860
00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.760
What will happen to Alys?

861
00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:24.440
Well. you're going to need
to start building a case

862
00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:26.600
of gross misconduct against Alys.

863
00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:43.440
Hiya. OK. I know you're
busy. love. but. um...

864
00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.840
..I was just thinking...

865
00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:49.560
..you know. I don't suppose. you
know. what with you working there.

866
00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:52.600
that you could get me
some shifts at the centre. maybe?

867
00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:54.000
No. it's really physical. Dad.

868
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000
Hey. come on.
I'm fit as a fiddle. me.

869
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.760
Dad. there's no jobs for you here.

870
00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.040
I need some work. Meggie.

871
00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.360
And you know there's
absolutely nothing else.

872
00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:07.720
Yeah. I know. but something
will come up. It'll be fine.

873
00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:10.240
Look. I can't talk about
it right now. but. um.

874
00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:12.120
I'll speak to later. OK?

875
00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:35.000
Kudos to team Theano.

876
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.920
{\an8}Today's leading pick rate
average 147 this hour.

877
00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:44.640
{\an8}This team. us as a team.

878
00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:47.960
are currently ranked
bottom at the centre.

879
00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:49.640
Bottom.

880
00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:52.040
And I'm pretty sure that
none of us want to be here.

881
00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:54.120
I don't want to be
here at the bottom.

882
00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:56.000
I'm sure you don't either.

883
00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:59.520
Are you OK. Karina?

884
00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:01.920
You know. you shouldn't be
here if you think you got Covid.

885
00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.440
No. it's allergies.

886
00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:05.800
She's got rent to pay. so.

887
00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.000
Right.

888
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.120
So. I am urging you all to stay
focused on your pick rate.

889
00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:17.160
It is really. really important.

890
00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:19.640
Every single one of us matters.

891
00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.080
It makes a difference.

892
00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:24.320
and we need to be desperate
to please our customers.

893
00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:27.080
{\an8}So please. please focus
on your pick rate today.

894
00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.440
{\an8}120.

895
00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:32.760
Unfortunately. there are
some members of this team

896
00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:34.480
that are not pulling their weight.

897
00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:38.800
and that means we are
falling way. way behind.

898
00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.520
However. on a better note.

899
00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:45.080
I would like to congratulate
Nadia on her continued improvement.

900
00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:47.480
Well done. It's really brilliant.

901
00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:49.080
And if you carry on like this.

902
00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.920
I'll put your name
forward for a green vest.

903
00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:54.240
And that's what happens
when we stay focused.

904
00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.440
Do you know what
else might help. Alys?

905
00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:03.120
If you actually stayed focused.

906
00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:07.440
Right. OK. that's everything.

907
00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:09.920
Like I said. 120 is the target.

908
00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:11.320
Pick. pick. pick.

909
00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:16.520
Proceed to X-0-0-1-

910
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.960
Proceed to N-0-7-

911
00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:26.520
Proceed to T-0-9...

912
00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:37.840
Proceed to S-0-8-

913
00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:35.160
You've had 11 minutes of
idle time this shift.

914
00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:37.640
Megan. I promise you.
I'm trying my best.

915
00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:40.360
My back is hurting so much.
I can't even think straight.

916
00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:41.920
Sorry. this is your best?

917
00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:43.800
Really. this is your best?

918
00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:50.160
Why are you doing this to me. Megan?

919
00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.000
I told you about my
blood pressure. didn't I?

920
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.640
I'm really worried
about everything.

921
00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:55.760
I begged you to get me
reassigned and make my life...

922
00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.920
You're not the only one
with a family to look after!

923
00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:01.720
We've only got my wage coming in.
I cannot afford to lose this job.

924
00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:04.000
But as per. all you can
think about is yourself.

925
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.480
The fuck are you talking about?
You've always been the same!

926
00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:08.920
The only person who matters to
Alys Morgan is Alys Morgan.

927
00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:11.280
Oh. my God. You are bullying me.
No! You're bullying me!

928
00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:13.240
I am trying to help you.
Do you understand that?

929
00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:15.280
I need this job.
Megan. I'm having a baby!

930
00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:18.320
I have done everything I
possibly can to help you.

931
00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:20.080
I just went to the
toilet in there. right?

932
00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:22.280
And I don't even know if I
saw what I think I saw.

933
00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:25.760
I thought it was like some
pinky water on the toilet paper.

934
00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:28.320
I'm not even sure. though.
I can't even see straight.

935
00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:30.360
I got a headache.
So it might be fine.

936
00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:32.000
I don't know.

937
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.760
And you're making it worse.
They are breathing down my neck!

938
00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:37.280
You're outrageous.
I am trying to help you.

939
00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:40.320
I got to get back to work.
And you just throw in my face.

940
00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:42.680
You've just thrown it in
my face the whole time!

941
00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:50.440
Proceed to X-0-0-1-

942
00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:53.760
Proceed to E-A-9.

943
00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:55.880
Proceed to next pick.

944
00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:03.040
Time for next pick exceeded.

945
00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:09.200
Time for next pick exceeded.

946
00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:18.800
Time for next pick exceeded.

947
00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:29.080
Time for next pick exceeded.

948
00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:38.520
Time for
next pick exceeded.

949
00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:42.200
She was outside the
toilets waiting for you?

950
00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:43.680
That's...that's fucked up.

951
00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:45.520
Is she blind? Can she not see?

952
00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:50.080
Talk to her.
she has to let you go home.

953
00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:52.840
Al. please.

954
00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:55.000
Please. She has to say yes.

955
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.960
Just go up to her and just be like.

956
00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:59.360
"I can't physically
carry on the way I am."

957
00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:03.200
And if you don't do it.
then I'm going to do it.

958
00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:07.320
Look. if you go home now.

959
00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:10.240
you'll be in breach
of your employment contract.

960
00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:11.520
You'll lose your green vest.

961
00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:13.960
Megan. I can't lose my maternity.

962
00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:15.720
Please. Alys.
there's nothing I can do.

963
00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:17.040
You need to finish your shift.

964
00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.400
It's just the afternoon.
You've used all your sick days.

965
00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:21.880
It's in your contract.

966
00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:24.840
You need to stay and
finish your shift.

967
00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:45.520
Proceed to Z-0-1...

968
00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:52.880
Pick. pick. pick. 120's the target.

969
00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:00.720
Time for next pick exceeded.

970
00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:04.200
Time for next pick...exceeded.

971
00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.600
Oh. God.

972
00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:19.840
Oh. my God. no!

973
00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:21.240
Oh. my God.

974
00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:29.440
Ugh!

975
00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:30.720
Ooh.

976
00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:34.560
Ugh.

977
00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:51.960
{\an8}SILENCE

978
00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:03.880
No. no. don't push.

979
00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:05.560
Do something! Ugh!

980
00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:07.240
Help her down. Hey.

981
00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:08.640
Hey. look at me.

982
00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:10.280
Do something! Get help!

983
00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:12.640
Megan. do something! Do something!

984
00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:14.640
Will you call the
fucking ambulance. please?

985
00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:17.280
OK. Look at me.

986
00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:18.760
Do something!

987
00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.880
What the fuck's wrong with you?!
Fucking hell!

988
00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:27.280
I can't help it!

989
00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:29.920
Ugh!

990
00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:31.640
Hello. can we get an ambulance.

991
00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:33.520
Get some towels and some water.

992
00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:36.160
Yeah?

993
00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:38.040
I need you to put it on her head.

994
00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:40.160
Hold it there. OK?
Just leave it there.

995
00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:41.520
Yeah? Kick your legs out then.

996
00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:45.400
Don't push down below. OK?

997
00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:47.360
Yeah. Yeah. there we are.

998
00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:50.160
OK. It's OK to
squeeze my hand. yeah.

999
00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:22.400
Alys. Alys. it's Dev.
Hey. Hey. listen to me.

1000
00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:25.720
I'm going get a taxi and I'm going
to follow right behind you. OK?

1001
00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:27.240
OK. I'll be right behind you. OK?

1002
00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:29.480
Yeah? All right.
They'll take good care of you.

1003
00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:33.760
Oi. listen to me.

1004
00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:36.560
I'm not fucking letting you
get away with this. All right?

1005
00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:00.680
Are you going to sack me?

1006
00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:05.640
Why would you think that?

1007
00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:11.000
Cos you're going to blame
me for what just happened.

1008
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.880
No.

1009
00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:14.280
No. no. no.

1010
00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:18.920
But you must see that an associate

1011
00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:20.960
having a miscarriage
in the toilets...

1012
00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:25.000
..that's not great news for us.

1013
00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:30.960
But you can make this right. Megan.

1014
00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:32.320
I know you can.

1015
00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:09.880
Nadia.

1016
00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:19.120
Everyone's devastated.

1017
00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:23.640
{\an8}Absolutely everyone is devastated.

1018
00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:27.280
{\an8}Obviously. everyone
is devastated. Alys.

1019
00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:29.760
{\an8}Absolutely devastated.

1020
00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:33.240
And although we know it won't
make up for what happened.

1021
00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:36.400
the company would like
to offer you some money.

1022
00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:40.280
and then you can take a
few weeks off to recover

1023
00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:42.160
without having to worry.

1024
00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:43.360
What?

1025
00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:46.240
As far as we're concerned.

1026
00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:48.520
you're still a valued
member of the team.

1027
00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:53.400
So we'd like to give you
£6.000 to help with things.

1028
00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:57.720
And we're prepared to
offer you £2.000. Devon.

1029
00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:02.800
What's this?

1030
00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:04.200
These are NDAs.

1031
00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:07.840
I don't know what that is.
what's an NDA?

1032
00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:09.160
A gagging order. basically.

1033
00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:11.160
It's a contract confirming...

1034
00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:14.040
..that you won't discuss
what happened with anyone.

1035
00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:15.840
Why?

1036
00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:19.440
Because you're worried how it'd
look if people find out. is it?

1037
00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:24.280
This is just to keep
things between ourselves.

1038
00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:28.400
{\an8}Do you want people
knowing your business. Alys?

1039
00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:29.520
But people know already.

1040
00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:32.000
everyone knows. I mean.
Nadia was there. for starters.

1041
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.960
I don't understand.

1042
00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:36.120
Nadia signed an agreement.

1043
00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:38.320
Bullshit. No. she wouldn't
do that. she's my friend.

1044
00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:39.560
She wouldn't sign...

1045
00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:42.240
Nadia and every other member
of the team have signed.

1046
00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:46.320
Alys... What have
you threatened her with?

1047
00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:47.720
It's not about threats. Devon.

1048
00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:49.880
Nadia wanted to become a
permanent member of staff.

1049
00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:51.720
she wanted a green vest.
Oh. fucking hell!

1050
00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:53.360
If we don't sign.
we ain't got our jobs.

1051
00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:55.120
we ain't got our
green vests or nothing?

1052
00:53:55.120 --> 00:54:00.400
Obviously. if you sign. there'll be
jobs here for you to come back to.

1053
00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:04.240
But if you don't. you will
lose your permanent status.

1054
00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:05.520
If you want the money.

1055
00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:08.000
you have to agree to
not tell anyone about it.

1056
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.400
And should you break that agreement.

1057
00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:14.080
the company will require
that the money be returned.

1058
00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:15.840
and there could be
legal consequences.

1059
00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:18.200
So you think. right. you
can fucking kill a baby... Devon!

1060
00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:20.280
..and make it go away
with eight grand?! Calm down.

1061
00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:22.000
Is that what you
fucking think? Calm down.

1062
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.680
You think you can give
us 8.000 between us

1063
00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:25.720
and make it fucking go away.
Nobody killed a baby.

1064
00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:28.200
It was a terrible tragedy.
No. I asked you if I could go!

1065
00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:30.720
Yeah! I begged you... And
you said no. carry on working!

1066
00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:33.080
I told you. I told you
when I went to the toilet.

1067
00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:34.320
I told you what was happening.

1068
00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:37.240
and you just ignored it. all you
told me to do was go back to work.

1069
00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:39.720
get my pick rate up... Alys...
..so don't say that to me!

1070
00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:43.000
I told you what was happening.
and you made me stay.

1071
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.240
If you had said to us
that you were in labour.

1072
00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:48.280
then things would've been different.
Oh. don't you fucking dare say that!

1073
00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:50.640
Things would've been different.
Don't you fucking dare!

1074
00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:52.320
You need to calm down. Devon.
Calm down?!

1075
00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:55.000
Don't you fucking dare say that.
Stop pointing your finger at me.

1076
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.680
I had to go to a hospital and sit
with other ladies who are pregnant.

1077
00:54:57.680 --> 00:54:58.960
waiting for their scans.

1078
00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:02.000
and I was there checking
that everything was out. Megan!

1079
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.720
Do you know how that made me feel?!

1080
00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:07.520
Now you're telling
me I've got to sign this.

1081
00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:10.440
otherwise I lose my job.
and I can't tell no-one.

1082
00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:13.520
and everyone signed it.
Nadia signed it?

1083
00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:16.040
Everyone on the team has signed it.

1084
00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:20.320
Fuck. Well. this is too... I
can't even focus.

1085
00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:22.760
I can't even read it properly.
I need time to think about it.

1086
00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:24.000
I'll level with you. Alys.

1087
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.240
This offer's not going
to be on the table overnight.

1088
00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:28.880
I had to twist arms as it is.

1089
00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:32.800
Al. even if it's not
just for us. right?

1090
00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:34.880
This is our opportunity to
take a fucking stand

1091
00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:38.800
and call them out for
who they actually are.

1092
00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:41.720
We should tell the whole
fucking world what they've done.

1093
00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:44.600
{\an8}Devon. if don't sign it.
there's nothing around here.

1094
00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:47.040
{\an8}What would we do?
We'd have no money.

1095
00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:50.400
We'd have nothing. no permanent job.

1096
00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:52.840
It'd be worse than everything
that's happened.

1097
00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:58.680
And we get eight grand.
that's a lot of money.

1098
00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:01.240
It's not a lot of money. We start
again. It's not a lot of money.

1099
00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:03.000
There's nothing else round here.

1100
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:27.000
Your jobs will be
waiting for you if you sign.

1101
00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:31.040
We'd love you to come back.

1102
00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:06.320
Well done. Megan.

1103
00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:08.720
No. no. no. no.
Sit. sit. sit. sit. sit.

1104
00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:12.880
Now everyone signed an NDA.

1105
00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:15.600
so we can put this
whole thing to bed.

1106
00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:18.720
And you. well. you
finished your probation.

1107
00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:20.280
So I think we can both agree.

1108
00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:22.960
you've got a very
bright future here.

1109
00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:26.320
It's yours for the taking.

1110
00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:39.040
Proceed to...

1111
00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:40.600
Time for next pick exceeded.

1112
00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:42.880
Proceed to next pick.

1113
00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:51.240
Proceed to... Proceed to...
