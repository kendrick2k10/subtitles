Oh. good to see you.

All right.
Good morning. guys.

55
00:02:47.942 --> 00:02:49.742
How's everybody doing?

56
00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.479
That good. huh. Jason?
Thank you for that.

57
00:02:55.548 --> 00:02:57.812
That's the last one
of those. okay?

58
00:03:02.822 --> 00:03:03.851
Hey.

59
00:03:04.654 --> 00:03:07.723
Hey. Tap him
on the shoulder. please.

60
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:10.660
Young man.
This is not daycare.

61
00:03:10.728 --> 00:03:13.465
-Then I'm in the wrong place.

62
00:03:13.533 --> 00:03:15.762
Mr. Faulk. why are we
in this classroom?

63
00:03:15.831 --> 00:03:17.732
Because this is where
I put you.

64
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:20.400
Get off the cell
or it's gonna be mine.

65
00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:22.508
Got it? Okay. Good.

66
00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:25.807
Now. please answer
when I call all of your names.

67
00:03:25.875 --> 00:03:27.546
Okay. Mr. Faulk.
I'll take it from here.

68
00:03:27.614 --> 00:03:29.346
Hold on a second. I'm busy here.
I'm taking attendance.

69
00:03:29.415 --> 00:03:31.516
Bro. there's like
six of us here.

70
00:03:31.584 --> 00:03:34.416
Yeah. Mr. Faulk.
why are you here today?

71
00:03:34.485 --> 00:03:36.620
Exactly what I was thinking.

72
00:03:38.425 --> 00:03:41.192
Okay. kids.
The real question...

73
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:43.258
is why are you all here today?

74
00:03:43.327 --> 00:03:45.024
I take this class.

75
00:03:45.092 --> 00:03:47.262
Mr. Faulk.
we're all very grateful

76
00:03:47.331 --> 00:03:48.763
for your sacrifice.

77
00:03:48.832 --> 00:03:50.701
These are called
school rules. okay?

78
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.501
I take attendance
and then I fill out this form.

79
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.676
That's the way it works. guys.

80
00:03:55.745 --> 00:03:57.575
Nobody cuts.

81
00:03:59.508 --> 00:04:01.614
Nobody causes trouble.

82
00:04:01.683 --> 00:04:04.483
All right. guys.
So anybody wanna do a warm up.

83
00:04:04.552 --> 00:04:07.884
stretching. vocal exercises?
Come on. guys.

84
00:04:08.654 --> 00:04:10.352
-Um. Mr. Faulk.

85
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.618
Mr. Faulk. Mr. Faulk.

86
00:04:11.687 --> 00:04:13.255
You know like we do...

87
00:04:13.324 --> 00:04:14.524
Excuse me. Not now.

88
00:04:14.592 --> 00:04:16.022
I'm just wondering
about lunch.

89
00:04:16.091 --> 00:04:18.228
Oh. yeah.
Actually. I. uh. need to eat

90
00:04:18.297 --> 00:04:19.963
at least five times a day.

91
00:04:20.032 --> 00:04:21.297
Hey. dude. I actually forgot
to pack my lunch this morning.

92
00:04:23.066 --> 00:04:26.273
I'm actually wondering
when the exam would be done?

93
00:04:26.342 --> 00:04:27.934
Also I definitely take
a pick for my--

94
00:04:28.003 --> 00:04:31.272
What's going on?
Seriously?

95
00:04:31.341 --> 00:04:33.076
Guys! Hello!

96
00:04:34.446 --> 00:04:36.548
Wow. Maybe this is daycare.

97
00:04:39.216 --> 00:04:40.453
Excuse me.

98
00:04:41.687 --> 00:04:44.017
That's not really
proper attire. is it?

99
00:04:44.086 --> 00:04:46.323
-A little creepy. dude.
-And you.

100
00:04:46.392 --> 00:04:47.823
do you own a pair of shoes?

101
00:04:47.892 --> 00:04:50.197
-Yeah.
-Put your feet on the floor.

102
00:04:50.266 --> 00:04:52.425
-And button it up. okay?
-Uh. Mr. Faulk.

103
00:04:52.494 --> 00:04:54.263
it's a Saturday.

104
00:04:54.332 --> 00:04:55.462
All right. people.

105
00:04:55.531 --> 00:04:57.029
Against my wishes.

106
00:04:57.098 --> 00:04:58.900
you've all been given
a second chance.

107
00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:01.300
So if you blow it. you will all
be in summer school.

108
00:05:01.368 --> 00:05:05.005
Class. I'll be back
in a minute. Come on.

109
00:05:16.324 --> 00:05:19.156
-What?
-Phil. what was that all about?

110
00:05:19.225 --> 00:05:20.621
Just doing my job.

111
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.295
Oh. I'm thrilled to hear it.

112
00:05:22.364 --> 00:05:24.663
Okay. Their attitude
is for shit.

113
00:05:24.732 --> 00:05:27.101
-Oh. would you lighten up.
-And I heard about you.

114
00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:28.666
What does that
supposed to mean?

115
00:05:28.734 --> 00:05:30.468
I mean. the way you teach.
All of these.

116
00:05:30.537 --> 00:05:31.831
The handholding
to a bunch of kids

117
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.904
that are too lazy
to do the work.

118
00:05:35.344 --> 00:05:37.175
You know.
I heard about you. too.

119
00:05:37.244 --> 00:05:38.940
-Oh. yeah?
-Yeah.

120
00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:41.073
I heard that you went
to high school here

121
00:05:41.142 --> 00:05:43.577
and that you were quite
the thespian

122
00:05:43.645 --> 00:05:46.152
and not a bad singer.

123
00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:47.982
Actually. I was a great singer

124
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.115
-till I came to my senses.
-Really? And--

125
00:05:50.184 --> 00:05:52.491
And realized it was
a freaking waste of time.

126
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.128
-Much like acting class. okay?

127
00:05:55.197 --> 00:05:57.557
Okay. I just need you to stay

128
00:05:57.626 --> 00:05:59.660
out of my process today.

129
00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:01.600
-Your process?
-Uh-hmm.

130
00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:05.267
Okay. Well. you want
a handhold? Go ahead.

131
00:06:06.103 --> 00:06:08.002
That's not the way it works
out there. Miranda.

132
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.011
Was that dramatic enough?

133
00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:27.019
You were that girl
protesting last week

134
00:06:27.088 --> 00:06:29.061
on the school lawn.
That was you.

135
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.027
It was for a good cause.

136
00:06:31.096 --> 00:06:32.763
Knew it.

137
00:06:33.966 --> 00:06:36.635
What are you looking at. huh?
Just the playbook?

138
00:06:37.567 --> 00:06:38.864
It's called preparation.

139
00:06:43.572 --> 00:06:47.112
Max. smile.

140
00:06:47.181 --> 00:06:48.514
Hey. what are you doing?

141
00:06:48.583 --> 00:06:50.081
Why? I can't take
no pictures of you?

142
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.384
No. you can't.

143
00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:52.882
He won't be posting
any of that.

144
00:06:52.951 --> 00:06:55.649
You know. why don't we all
take a group shot?

145
00:06:55.718 --> 00:06:57.624
A group shot? For what?

146
00:06:57.692 --> 00:07:00.494
Don't we just sign
like a release or something?

147
00:07:02.262 --> 00:07:03.958
I'm kidding. guys.

148
00:07:04.027 --> 00:07:05.895
-Yeah. Good joke.
-Yes. that's jokes.

149
00:07:05.964 --> 00:07:07.666
No. Come on.
I'm serious. Come on.

150
00:07:07.735 --> 00:07:09.731
-Let's do it. You in?
-You know what? Sure.

151
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.271
-Why not?
-And she with it.

152
00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.538
Come on. boy.
Move around.

153
00:07:13.607 --> 00:07:15.141
Yeah. She wants
to take a picture.

154
00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:16.609
Let's go. guys. Get up.

155
00:07:16.678 --> 00:07:17.670
-Come on.
-Get up off your asses.

156
00:07:17.739 --> 00:07:19.172
-Go.
-Please?

157
00:07:19.241 --> 00:07:20.811
-Come on. boys.
-Stop touching me.

158
00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:22.382
-Okay.
-All right. Jessie.

159
00:07:22.451 --> 00:07:23.643
Do you want to take
the picture?

160
00:07:23.712 --> 00:07:25.611
Sure. Okay.

161
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.114
I'll just...

162
00:07:29.456 --> 00:07:31.151
Okay. I don't look too good.

163
00:07:32.456 --> 00:07:33.824
Okay.

164
00:07:33.892 --> 00:07:35.626
All right. I think
we got some good ones.

165
00:07:35.695 --> 00:07:37.663
Got it? Yeah.
Send that to Faulk. yeah.

166
00:07:42.598 --> 00:07:43.933
So I hear...

167
00:07:45.003 --> 00:07:47.903
golden boy. he's been scouted.
big shot now.

168
00:07:47.972 --> 00:07:50.073
Yeah. What.
you jealous. Tarzan?

169
00:07:50.142 --> 00:07:51.545
No.

170
00:07:52.579 --> 00:07:54.141
Why aren't you
on the field today. huh?

171
00:07:55.251 --> 00:07:56.647
Same reason we're all here.

172
00:07:56.716 --> 00:07:58.112
What other reason
would there be?

173
00:07:58.181 --> 00:07:59.685
Why don't you get this
out of my face. huh?

174
00:08:00.815 --> 00:08:02.489
What's your problem?

175
00:08:02.558 --> 00:08:03.986
I got a few.
You wanna hear about 'em?

176
00:08:06.127 --> 00:08:07.352
No. you don't.

177
00:08:07.421 --> 00:08:09.793
I can see this is gonna be
a fun-filled day.

178
00:08:09.862 --> 00:08:11.660
But why are you
in this class. huh?

179
00:08:11.729 --> 00:08:12.993
Did you stand in the wrong line?

180
00:08:13.062 --> 00:08:14.830
Yeah. Maybe I did.
why do you care?

181
00:08:14.899 --> 00:08:16.766
Well. I sense a humor
in this guy.

182
00:08:16.835 --> 00:08:18.372
I'll show you
my sense of humor.

183
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.931
Easy. boy.
Easy. Okay?

184
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.839
I'm just breaking the ice.

185
00:08:21.908 --> 00:08:24.242
Hey. will you be like this
all day or what?

186
00:08:24.311 --> 00:08:25.573
Warming up my man.

187
00:08:25.642 --> 00:08:26.975
You know. Push me.

188
00:08:27.044 --> 00:08:28.713
I'll blow this whole
fucking place up.

189
00:08:28.782 --> 00:08:30.210
-Excuse me?

190
00:08:30.279 --> 00:08:31.611
Don't let Faulk
hear you talking like that.

191
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.851
Oh. fuck him.

192
00:08:34.652 --> 00:08:36.016
You're an idiot. Jason.

193
00:08:36.085 --> 00:08:37.886
-Oh. yeah?
-Gonna lay here all day.

194
00:08:37.955 --> 00:08:39.284
Why?
You gonna get on top?

195
00:08:39.353 --> 00:08:40.824
-Oh. my God. you wish.
-Uh-hmm.

196
00:08:40.893 --> 00:08:42.254
Okay. Listen.
I'm sick of this act.

197
00:08:42.323 --> 00:08:43.861
I want you back in your seat
right now

198
00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:44.923
or I'm gonna throw you
out of the school.

199
00:08:44.992 --> 00:08:46.065
You have three seconds.

200
00:08:46.134 --> 00:08:49.101
One. two. seated.

201
00:08:49.169 --> 00:08:50.536
Thank you.

202
00:08:50.604 --> 00:08:52.331
All right.
Listen up. children.

203
00:08:52.399 --> 00:08:53.701
There's something
I wanna tell you guys.

204
00:08:53.769 --> 00:08:54.867
I wanna make it very--

205
00:08:54.935 --> 00:08:56.669
Excuse me. young lady.

206
00:08:56.738 --> 00:08:58.512
School rules.

207
00:08:58.581 --> 00:09:00.108
We discussed
this a few minutes ago.

208
00:09:00.177 --> 00:09:03.111
Please put the phone away
and no taking pictures.

209
00:09:05.653 --> 00:09:07.920
Wow. Do you have one
for everybody?

210
00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:11.255
-I'm hungry.
-Put the granola away. please.

211
00:09:11.323 --> 00:09:12.719
Thank you.

212
00:09:12.788 --> 00:09:14.859
Okay. Ms. Long's got it.

213
00:09:16.164 --> 00:09:17.561
All right. guys.

214
00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.763
Anyone remember this assignment.

215
00:09:19.832 --> 00:09:22.834
this make up exam
that we're all here for?

216
00:09:24.434 --> 00:09:25.672
Huh?

217
00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.138
So. if you recall.

218
00:09:28.206 --> 00:09:31.436
I asked you to create
a character for a scene today.

219
00:09:32.406 --> 00:09:34.815
Each one of you
is gonna get up there

220
00:09:34.883 --> 00:09:37.410
and explain your choices.
how you got there and why.

221
00:09:37.479 --> 00:09:40.948
And then. you know.
what's coming next. Come on.

222
00:09:41.016 --> 00:09:44.251
Gonna assign you
a scene partner.

223
00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:46.385
Scene partners?

224
00:09:47.255 --> 00:09:49.696
-I have a question.
-What is it?

225
00:09:50.628 --> 00:09:52.361
How do we do that?

226
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:54.964
Allie. the same way
we've been doing it all year.

227
00:09:55.033 --> 00:09:58.767
except this time.
no script and no excuses.

228
00:09:58.836 --> 00:10:00.502
Better clear my calendar. huh?

229
00:10:00.571 --> 00:10:02.240
So no script?

230
00:10:02.309 --> 00:10:04.006
Improvisation.

231
00:10:04.075 --> 00:10:06.645
-Improvisation.
-And then we go home?

232
00:10:06.714 --> 00:10:08.507
Why can't you just
hand out scenes?

233
00:10:08.575 --> 00:10:11.250
Because. like I said.
it's about what you've learned.

234
00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:12.786
And not only that.

235
00:10:12.854 --> 00:10:14.386
it's about connecting
to the character. okay.

236
00:10:14.455 --> 00:10:16.655
Using your imagination.

237
00:10:16.724 --> 00:10:18.083
It should take everybody
about a minute.

238
00:10:18.152 --> 00:10:20.327
Mr. Faulk. you're not helping.

239
00:10:20.396 --> 00:10:21.858
Yeah. What's with the partners?

240
00:10:21.927 --> 00:10:23.763
I'm going to assign them
to you in a minute

241
00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:26.261
and then you have one hour
to write it up.

242
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.734
Did any of you actually
attend this class or what?

243
00:10:28.803 --> 00:10:30.732
You will draw
on experiences

244
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.871
from your real lives.

245
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.636
-What if your life sucks?
-Then your scene sucks.

246
00:10:35.705 --> 00:10:37.374
That's stupid.

247
00:10:37.443 --> 00:10:39.379
I hope not.

248
00:10:39.448 --> 00:10:41.011
I blew a Saturday for this?

249
00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.682
-You tell him.
-Okay. guys. Listen.

250
00:10:43.751 --> 00:10:46.782
Just try to get
all the world's troubles

251
00:10:46.851 --> 00:10:48.313
out of your head today. okay?

252
00:10:48.382 --> 00:10:50.624
Oh. but then somehow
y'all old ass

253
00:10:50.693 --> 00:10:52.956
-is always screwed up for.
-Exactly.

254
00:10:53.025 --> 00:10:55.762
Can we just not do that today.
please?

255
00:10:57.232 --> 00:10:58.699
I've been there.

256
00:10:59.927 --> 00:11:01.196
Look inward.

257
00:11:02.732 --> 00:11:04.501
Those feelings.

258
00:11:04.569 --> 00:11:06.467
those emotions.

259
00:11:07.237 --> 00:11:09.202
Uh. you might need
to describe emotions

260
00:11:09.271 --> 00:11:10.774
because he's only got one
and it's anger.

261
00:11:10.843 --> 00:11:11.873
All right. guys. Come on.

262
00:11:11.942 --> 00:11:13.440
Help each other out. all right?

263
00:11:13.509 --> 00:11:15.375
Support each other
and push each other a little.

264
00:11:15.443 --> 00:11:17.550
You may not like
what you find.

265
00:11:17.619 --> 00:11:20.352
Michael.
since you're speaking up.

266
00:11:20.421 --> 00:11:22.047
you get paired up first.

267
00:11:22.116 --> 00:11:24.318
You will go with Allie.

268
00:11:25.988 --> 00:11:28.220
-Why me?
-Casey.

269
00:11:28.289 --> 00:11:30.323
-you are gonna work with Jason.
-Oh.

270
00:11:30.392 --> 00:11:32.599
What? Oh. honey.
I'm doing you a favor.

271
00:11:32.667 --> 00:11:34.964
-Yeah?
-Guess. that leaves us.

272
00:11:35.033 --> 00:11:37.195
-Good guess.
-Wonderful.

273
00:11:37.264 --> 00:11:39.969
-Ms. Long--
-Ms. Long.

274
00:11:40.037 --> 00:11:41.903
-Yes. yes. Jessie.
-All right.

275
00:11:41.972 --> 00:11:43.268
Do we really have to work with--

276
00:11:43.337 --> 00:11:44.842
Are you some kind
of fucking prize?

277
00:11:44.911 --> 00:11:47.176
Hey. Language.
young man. please.

278
00:11:48.108 --> 00:11:49.475
Keep it clean. okay?

279
00:11:49.543 --> 00:11:50.979
Guys. guys. I hope
you put as much energy

280
00:11:51.047 --> 00:11:52.451
into your scenes
as you're doing.

281
00:11:52.519 --> 00:11:53.782
trying to avoid them.

282
00:11:53.851 --> 00:11:55.822
Hey. Mr. Faulk. Mr. Faulk.

283
00:11:55.891 --> 00:11:57.657
-You need to get to work.
-No. no. serious.

284
00:11:57.726 --> 00:11:59.255
-I got a question.
-No. you're not serious.

285
00:11:59.324 --> 00:12:01.157
-Yeah. yeah. yeah.
-You don't have any questions.

286
00:12:01.226 --> 00:12:03.291
-Yeah.
-And there's no recess. okay?

287
00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.832
-How did he know?
-Hey. you're listening.

288
00:12:05.901 --> 00:12:08.499
All right. guys. guys.
you've got one hour

289
00:12:08.568 --> 00:12:10.067
on the clock. okay?

290
00:12:12.237 --> 00:12:13.771
-Question. Ms. Long.
-Hey.

291
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.068
-Yes.
-Whatever--

292
00:12:16.137 --> 00:12:18.040
we're about to do this?

293
00:12:18.109 --> 00:12:19.712
What you're about to do
right now?

294
00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:20.942
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Or. you know. like.

295
00:12:21.011 --> 00:12:22.277
whatever you're talking about.

296
00:12:23.717 --> 00:12:25.885
Okay. That's a serious question.

297
00:12:26.783 --> 00:12:28.149
Look. guys.

298
00:12:28.218 --> 00:12:30.018
I never said
it was gonna be easy.

299
00:12:30.086 --> 00:12:31.517
You didn't answer
the question.

300
00:12:33.887 --> 00:12:35.257
Yes.

301
00:12:36.463 --> 00:12:38.461
Yes. I have.

302
00:12:39.264 --> 00:12:42.201
Okay. As I was saying.
one hour on the clock.

303
00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.968
Ready?

304
00:12:44.037 --> 00:12:45.599
-Yeah.
-You ready?

305
00:12:45.667 --> 00:12:46.935
-You're gonna bring it?
-I'm gonna bring it.

306
00:12:47.004 --> 00:12:48.001
All right. Awesome.

307
00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:49.669
I'm not as dumb as I look.

308
00:12:49.737 --> 00:12:52.142
Phil. I asked you
kindly to please stay out of it.

309
00:12:52.211 --> 00:12:53.914
You know. if this was
during the week. yeah.

310
00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:55.509
-But. uh. today they're mine.
-You know what?

311
00:12:55.578 --> 00:12:57.913
I'm just trying to instill
trust. if there is all.

312
00:12:57.982 --> 00:12:59.918
Without it they stay walled off.

313
00:12:59.987 --> 00:13:02.114
Okay. But you're wasting
not only your time.

314
00:13:02.182 --> 00:13:04.252
but my Saturday. okay?

315
00:13:04.321 --> 00:13:06.418
Oh. that's a cool idea.
You know what?

316
00:13:06.487 --> 00:13:08.090
Why don't you go golfing
and I'll tell him

317
00:13:08.159 --> 00:13:09.763
-you were here today.
-You wish.

318
00:13:09.832 --> 00:13:11.490
-I do.
-Okay. Well. my job is to tell

319
00:13:11.559 --> 00:13:13.834
this principal that
these misfits showed up.

320
00:13:13.902 --> 00:13:16.063
did their assignments.
passed or failed.

321
00:13:16.132 --> 00:13:17.463
whatever that's worth. okay?

322
00:13:17.532 --> 00:13:19.734
You have a lot
to learn about--

323
00:13:19.803 --> 00:13:21.236
well. a lot.

324
00:13:21.305 --> 00:13:22.842
No. Actually.
what you need to learn

325
00:13:22.911 --> 00:13:24.741
is that I'm tenure.
you're adjunct.

326
00:13:24.809 --> 00:13:27.379
Tenure. adjunct. okay?

327
00:13:27.448 --> 00:13:28.646
You failed them.

328
00:13:28.714 --> 00:13:29.943
You brought them here.

329
00:13:30.012 --> 00:13:31.384
You do the daycare.

Someone should blow up
this school.

350
00:14:46.325 --> 00:14:48.353
Second time you've said
something like that.

351
00:14:48.422 --> 00:14:50.123
Why do you think that's funny?

352
00:14:50.192 --> 00:14:51.932
Do you see me laughing?

353
00:14:53.266 --> 00:14:55.529
-Dude. you got issues.
-Who the hell doesn't?

354
00:14:55.598 --> 00:14:57.963
Is this something
we need to worry about?

355
00:14:58.032 --> 00:14:59.735
Relax.

356
00:14:59.804 --> 00:15:01.405
I'm just saying.

357
00:15:01.474 --> 00:15:04.008
We're supposed to report
language like that. aren't we?

358
00:15:04.077 --> 00:15:06.606
What's your problem.
anyway. huh?

359
00:15:06.674 --> 00:15:08.607
We're supposed
to get to know each other?

360
00:15:08.676 --> 00:15:11.045
We hear enough
of that shit out there.

361
00:15:11.114 --> 00:15:13.250
She's right. Columbine.

362
00:15:13.319 --> 00:15:15.516
-Now. give it a rest.
-So now. you know me.

363
00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:18.651
I don't think
I wanna know him.

364
00:15:26.898 --> 00:15:28.232
What are you doing?

365
00:15:29.435 --> 00:15:31.202
What does it look like
I'm doing? I'm stretching.

366
00:15:32.773 --> 00:15:34.171
<i> Phil. wait up.</i>

367
00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.134
Look. I don't wanna
argue with you.

368
00:15:36.203 --> 00:15:37.537
Okay. then don't.

369
00:15:37.606 --> 00:15:38.974
But you know that
what they need to do

370
00:15:39.043 --> 00:15:40.473
in there today isn't easy.

371
00:15:40.542 --> 00:15:42.915
What algebra and biology?
That's not easy.

372
00:15:42.984 --> 00:15:45.881
Art. acting.
freedom of expression.

373
00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:47.450
Oh. my God. I mean.

374
00:15:47.519 --> 00:15:49.254
it's so important for growth.
Don't you get it?

375
00:15:49.323 --> 00:15:50.922
Okay. Then tell me why
those are the first classes

376
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:52.422
they cut
when the budget's tight?

377
00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:54.624
Oh. my God. That's such
an ignorant statement.

378
00:15:54.693 --> 00:15:56.688
Well. I think you're running
a sensitivity class up there.

379
00:15:56.757 --> 00:15:59.426
Do you ever say
anything constructive?

380
00:15:59.495 --> 00:16:01.726
Yeah. I'd say
fail the whole bunch

381
00:16:01.795 --> 00:16:04.669
-and call it a day.
-Just let me do my thing.

382
00:16:04.738 --> 00:16:06.400
I call that handholding.

383
00:16:06.469 --> 00:16:09.609
-I call that teaching.
-Whatever.

384
00:16:26.457 --> 00:16:29.193
Always walk around
with that attitude?

385
00:16:29.262 --> 00:16:31.460
You always walk around
like yourself?

386
00:16:35.035 --> 00:16:37.669
Fuck you.
I can't believe you.

387
00:16:37.737 --> 00:16:39.164
You started it.

388
00:16:39.233 --> 00:16:41.239
-Really?
-Yeah.

389
00:16:44.043 --> 00:16:46.277
That shit don't work on me.

390
00:16:47.912 --> 00:16:48.975
And what does?

391
00:16:49.044 --> 00:16:50.309
Guys.

392
00:16:50.377 --> 00:16:52.182
Try to do the assignment.

393
00:16:52.251 --> 00:16:54.416
Yeah. keep it down.
cockazaoid.

394
00:16:54.485 --> 00:16:55.952
You think life
is really worth living

395
00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.486
with all this stress?

396
00:16:59.487 --> 00:17:01.556
See something. say something?

397
00:17:02.826 --> 00:17:04.064
No?

398
00:17:08.834 --> 00:17:10.202
College boy.

399
00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.838
You still talking?

400
00:17:12.907 --> 00:17:15.068
No one is interested. okay?

401
00:17:15.137 --> 00:17:16.571
Guys.

402
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.644
Mr. Faulk is probably
right outside the door

403
00:17:18.713 --> 00:17:19.771
with his ear to it.

404
00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.110
Why the fuck
would he be doing that?

405
00:17:21.179 --> 00:17:23.512
I don't know.
But he's creepy.

406
00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:25.183
Some of us actually
has something to lose.

407
00:17:25.252 --> 00:17:26.845
-Thank you. Max.
-Like what?

408
00:17:40.829 --> 00:17:43.136
You're drinking at school?
Are you kidding?

409
00:17:43.205 --> 00:17:44.832
You're gonna get
everyone here in trouble.

410
00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.436
-I hope you know that.
-All right. You need to relax.

411
00:17:47.505 --> 00:17:49.271
-I say go for it.
-Back off right now.

412
00:17:49.339 --> 00:17:50.902
No. I'm not gonna
sit back down.

413
00:17:50.971 --> 00:17:52.807
Oh. great. Now everybody's up.
Thanks a lot.

414
00:17:52.876 --> 00:17:54.577
-Just sit back down then.
-I can't believe this.

415
00:17:54.646 --> 00:17:56.148
-You bring liquor. asshole?
-Get out of my face.

416
00:17:56.217 --> 00:17:57.744
I'm not gonna get out
of your face.

417
00:17:57.813 --> 00:17:59.449
-It's everyone's problem.
-No. it's not.

418
00:17:59.518 --> 00:18:00.979
Now why don't you sit
back down. tough guy?

419
00:18:01.047 --> 00:18:02.750
Why don't you put that back
in your bag. huh?

420
00:18:02.819 --> 00:18:04.521
Get back. man. It's just not
that big of a deal.

421
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:05.825
No. I'm not gonna chill.
He could have everyone expelled.

422
00:18:05.894 --> 00:18:07.158
Expelled for shit. huh?

423
00:18:07.227 --> 00:18:08.556
Guys.
they could come in.

424
00:18:08.625 --> 00:18:09.828
All right. it's gone.
You happy now?

425
00:18:09.896 --> 00:18:11.330
That's messed up.

426
00:18:11.398 --> 00:18:12.692
Messed up. huh?
That's what I thought.

427
00:18:12.761 --> 00:18:13.864
When Faulk sees this.
we're all done.

428
00:18:13.933 --> 00:18:15.500
Now here he comes.

429
00:18:15.569 --> 00:18:17.001
-I can't believe this shit.
-You kidding? He's coming?

430
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:18.935
Yes.
Go fucking sit down. huh?

431
00:18:19.004 --> 00:18:20.305
Oh my God.

432
00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.344
So what's all the noise about?

433
00:18:25.413 --> 00:18:27.206
You know I can hear you guys
in my office. right?

434
00:18:27.275 --> 00:18:28.808
Sorry. Mr. Faulk.

435
00:18:28.877 --> 00:18:31.047
-We're working really hard.
-You heard him.

436
00:18:31.116 --> 00:18:32.446
Finding our characters.

437
00:18:32.514 --> 00:18:34.549
-As they say.
-Emoting.

438
00:18:34.618 --> 00:18:36.349
Discovering
our most inner thoughts.

439
00:18:36.418 --> 00:18:38.022
-Really?
-Okay.

440
00:18:38.091 --> 00:18:39.720
There's nothing on that paper.

441
00:18:40.988 --> 00:18:43.862
Don't tell me you guys
haven't done anything.

442
00:18:43.931 --> 00:18:45.527
Please. please. please.

443
00:18:45.596 --> 00:18:48.234
tell me you have something
to show me.

444
00:18:49.836 --> 00:18:51.299
We're stuck.

445
00:18:51.368 --> 00:18:53.532
We've covered this.

446
00:18:53.601 --> 00:18:56.008
Ms. Long. does this...

447
00:18:56.077 --> 00:18:57.638
really have to be
all touchy-feely?

448
00:18:57.707 --> 00:19:01.107
No. It just has
to be really honest.

449
00:19:01.176 --> 00:19:02.275
Honest?

450
00:19:02.344 --> 00:19:03.942
So what did you do?

451
00:19:04.979 --> 00:19:08.049
No. no. no. no.
It's not about me today.

452
00:19:08.118 --> 00:19:09.519
Just tell us.

453
00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.386
All right.
You know what.

454
00:19:12.455 --> 00:19:14.821
maybe I will tell you later.

455
00:19:16.028 --> 00:19:17.190
Don't worry.

456
00:19:17.259 --> 00:19:18.727
I'll remind you.

457
00:19:18.795 --> 00:19:21.366
No doubt. Michael. No doubt.

458
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:24.368
Hey. Mr. Faulk.

459
00:19:24.437 --> 00:19:28.070
You're respectfully
stifling our creativity.

460
00:19:28.139 --> 00:19:29.404
Listen. sunflower seeds.

461
00:19:29.473 --> 00:19:30.908
if I wanted any comments
from you.

462
00:19:30.977 --> 00:19:32.205
I'll let you know. okay?

463
00:19:32.274 --> 00:19:33.340
So much tension.

464
00:19:33.409 --> 00:19:34.775
Yes. Mr. Faulk.

465
00:19:34.843 --> 00:19:36.546
I'd have to agree
with Jason over there.

466
00:19:36.614 --> 00:19:38.242
You're really stifling
our creativity. you know?

467
00:19:38.311 --> 00:19:41.516
All this tension that seems
to follow you into the room.

468
00:19:41.585 --> 00:19:43.252
Yeah. I would have
to agree too.

469
00:19:43.321 --> 00:19:44.684
You do keep on running in here.

470
00:19:44.753 --> 00:19:46.924
Uh-hmm. Breaking
our concentration.

471
00:19:46.993 --> 00:19:48.955
Life. What a waste.

472
00:19:49.023 --> 00:19:51.393
Yeah. I think
he means today is a waste.

473
00:19:51.461 --> 00:19:53.428
Ms. Long.
as we can see.

474
00:19:53.497 --> 00:19:55.495
this class
really lacks discipline.

475
00:19:55.564 --> 00:19:56.995
Give me 30 minutes with them.

476
00:19:57.063 --> 00:20:00.437
Thank you for that observation.
All right. guys.

477
00:20:00.506 --> 00:20:03.272
I just bought you
another 30 minutes.

478
00:20:03.341 --> 00:20:04.939
but it's your last chance. okay?

479
00:20:05.008 --> 00:20:07.311
Please let there be something
to show when I get back.

480
00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.682
Right. We actually
wanna graduate.

481
00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:11.216
Just saying.

482
00:20:11.285 --> 00:20:13.011
Mr. Faulk. after you.

483
00:20:15.086 --> 00:20:16.218

Who's up first?

509
00:21:56.824 --> 00:21:58.017
Jason.

510
00:21:58.086 --> 00:22:00.188
Jason. you were born
to do this assignment.

511
00:22:00.257 --> 00:22:01.526
Are you ready?

512
00:22:14.508 --> 00:22:16.041
Okay. look.
in my analysis.

513
00:22:16.109 --> 00:22:18.236
my character. he's...

514
00:22:18.304 --> 00:22:21.975
he's kind of like what everybody
would want. you know.

515
00:22:22.044 --> 00:22:25.043
He's a bit of a player
but everybody loves--

516
00:22:25.112 --> 00:22:27.151
like. everybody.
like. loves that guy.

517
00:22:27.219 --> 00:22:28.519
you know what I'm saying?

518
00:22:28.588 --> 00:22:29.950
Kind of like a Joey
from<i> Friends.</i>

519
00:22:32.791 --> 00:22:34.691
Well. I wouldn't expect
you all to understand.

520
00:22:36.263 --> 00:22:37.860
No. tell us about that guy.

521
00:22:37.929 --> 00:22:40.397
Well. he's like a bit
of an internet genius type.

522
00:22:40.466 --> 00:22:42.630
meaning that
he created shit up here.

523
00:22:42.698 --> 00:22:45.004
So. I don't know.
he's a winner.

524
00:22:45.072 --> 00:22:46.402
He did it all in his own.

525
00:22:46.471 --> 00:22:48.170
Didn't need anybody to do it.

526
00:22:48.239 --> 00:22:50.041
A self-made man.

527
00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:51.544
Did it the American way.

528
00:22:51.612 --> 00:22:53.241
so he screwed everybody
on his way to the top.

529
00:22:54.746 --> 00:22:57.180
I'm taking a page
from you fine adults.

530
00:22:57.249 --> 00:22:59.518
Oh my God. What is this?

531
00:23:05.185 --> 00:23:07.889
Well. I wouldn't
be surprised. you know.

532
00:23:09.257 --> 00:23:11.861
Out there. you're either in
or you're in the way.

533
00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:14.632
When people are done with you.
they move on. right?

534
00:23:15.833 --> 00:23:19.439
We're all thrown
into this world and...

535
00:23:20.903 --> 00:23:22.904
we all just have to
figure it out.

536
00:23:24.144 --> 00:23:25.841
So my character...

537
00:23:28.576 --> 00:23:30.450
lives for today.

538
00:23:31.747 --> 00:23:34.080
And that's my analysis now.

539
00:23:39.654 --> 00:23:41.461
Well. all righty then.

540
00:23:42.296 --> 00:23:43.762
Give it up for your classmate.

541
00:23:43.831 --> 00:23:44.860
Come on.

542
00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:46.826
All right.

543
00:23:46.894 --> 00:23:48.730
-That was very creative.
-Uh-hmm.

544
00:23:48.799 --> 00:23:52.533
A little disturbing
but creative.

545
00:23:52.601 --> 00:23:54.672
Anything else to add?

546
00:23:55.469 --> 00:23:56.436
No.

547
00:23:56.505 --> 00:23:57.737
It's perfect.

548
00:23:57.806 --> 00:23:59.538
All right.
Who's next?

549
00:23:59.607 --> 00:24:01.074
I need a nap.

550
00:24:07.313 --> 00:24:10.049
Well. she may be.
you know. intelligent

551
00:24:10.118 --> 00:24:13.493
when it comes to studying
and stuff like that.

552
00:24:15.792 --> 00:24:19.827
her lack of communicating
with people.

553
00:24:19.896 --> 00:24:24.265
talking with friends.
and family.

554
00:24:24.334 --> 00:24:26.136
and...

555
00:24:26.972 --> 00:24:33.007
revealed the true feelings
of rejection and pain.

556
00:24:33.776 --> 00:24:35.207
This isn't a science project.

557
00:24:36.183 --> 00:24:37.415
You're ruining my focus.

558
00:24:37.484 --> 00:24:39.046
Jason.
you're not helping.

559
00:24:44.125 --> 00:24:45.991
Did I interrupt you?

560
00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:47.626
Yeah. You did.

561
00:24:48.556 --> 00:24:49.553
Whatever.

562
00:24:49.622 --> 00:24:51.461
Anyways.

563
00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:55.667
this. um... this vulnerability--

564
00:24:55.735 --> 00:25:00.536
No. this lack
of connecting with people.

565
00:25:00.605 --> 00:25:02.141
You're talking about yourself.

566
00:25:02.209 --> 00:25:04.072
No. I don't think so.

567
00:25:04.141 --> 00:25:05.874
Michael. do you want
that when you go up?

568
00:25:05.943 --> 00:25:08.174
Sorry.
Just trying to help.

569
00:25:08.242 --> 00:25:10.008
Well. it's not.
so can you please stop?

570
00:25:10.077 --> 00:25:11.782
No. you know better.
Just...

571
00:25:12.614 --> 00:25:13.850
Anyways.

572
00:25:15.819 --> 00:25:17.985
when it--
when it comes to people.

573
00:25:18.054 --> 00:25:21.187
you know.
and from my own life maybe.

574
00:25:22.162 --> 00:25:25.158
maybe I think--

575
00:25:26.527 --> 00:25:30.500
I think we all have this fear
of rejection. you know?

576
00:25:30.569 --> 00:25:34.504
To be loved and to love someone

577
00:25:34.573 --> 00:25:38.237
and not be loved back. you know?

578
00:25:39.378 --> 00:25:41.746
Anyways. what I'll use

579
00:25:41.815 --> 00:25:44.711
to connect and relate
with this character

580
00:25:44.779 --> 00:25:47.611
is the fact that I-- she.

581
00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.452
She.

582
00:25:49.521 --> 00:25:51.486
She has this problem with.

583
00:25:51.555 --> 00:25:54.627
you know. communicating.

584
00:25:55.828 --> 00:25:58.162
You guys-- you guys know
what I just said. yeah?

585
00:25:58.231 --> 00:25:59.258
What I meant.

586
00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:02.932
Okay.

587
00:26:05.867 --> 00:26:07.434
Can I please sit down now?

588
00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:09.769
You tell me.
Anything else to add?

589
00:26:09.838 --> 00:26:12.037
-No.
-Okay then.

590
00:26:12.105 --> 00:26:14.112
-Thank you.
-Well done.

591
00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:15.113
Well done.

592
00:26:15.182 --> 00:26:16.213
Come on. guys.

593
00:26:20.816 --> 00:26:22.182
What the hell did she say?

594
00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:24.616
Who's next?

595
00:26:24.685 --> 00:26:26.255
Jessie?

596
00:26:26.324 --> 00:26:27.759
Ready?

597
00:26:37.533 --> 00:26:38.935
Um...

598
00:26:39.504 --> 00:26:42.440
So. if she could not sing

599
00:26:42.509 --> 00:26:44.776
then she would not want to live.

600
00:26:50.344 --> 00:26:53.378
Singing became her breathing.
you know?

601
00:26:54.519 --> 00:26:56.150
It was an obsession.

602
00:26:57.183 --> 00:27:00.253
No. it's more like a passion.

603
00:27:02.188 --> 00:27:04.059
It's a place where she can go.

604
00:27:05.359 --> 00:27:07.161
Don't we all need
a place like that?

605
00:27:08.502 --> 00:27:10.164
A place to kind of get away.

606
00:27:11.469 --> 00:27:12.738
find yourself.

607
00:27:15.938 --> 00:27:18.172
a place not to feel any pain

608
00:27:21.777 --> 00:27:23.243
and find happiness.

609
00:27:33.855 --> 00:27:35.590
Stop looking at me weird.

610
00:27:44.833 --> 00:27:46.431
You say that our soul...

611
00:27:48.171 --> 00:27:50.710
if you're not able
to live your dream.

612
00:27:52.439 --> 00:27:57.981
someone or something
stops you from living it.

613
00:28:01.255 --> 00:28:02.480
the soul dies.

614
00:28:11.759 --> 00:28:13.194
I'm sorry.

615
00:28:14.863 --> 00:28:16.395
That sounds stupid.

616
00:28:18.369 --> 00:28:19.398
No.

617
00:28:20.433 --> 00:28:22.504
No. it doesn't sound
stupid at all.

618
00:28:24.906 --> 00:28:26.604
In fact.

619
00:28:26.673 --> 00:28:28.973
that was really deep
and that took a lot of courage

620
00:28:29.042 --> 00:28:30.008
to really go there.

621
00:28:30.076 --> 00:28:31.648
Did you guys see that?

622
00:28:31.717 --> 00:28:33.378
You know. living in the moment.

623
00:28:33.447 --> 00:28:36.120
seeing people for
who they really are.

624
00:28:36.189 --> 00:28:38.586
I look forward to seeing
where you're going with this.

625
00:28:38.654 --> 00:28:40.023
Well done.

626
00:28:44.495 --> 00:28:45.690
Okay.

627
00:28:45.759 --> 00:28:46.761
Michael.

628
00:28:46.829 --> 00:28:48.394
You haven't gone yet.

629
00:28:55.268 --> 00:28:56.875
Everywhere we look.

630
00:28:58.106 --> 00:29:00.576
all this violence out there.

631
00:29:00.645 --> 00:29:02.408
this freaking chaos.

632
00:29:03.177 --> 00:29:04.783
police wasting
innocent people.

633
00:29:04.852 --> 00:29:07.683
racism. you can't make
this shit up.

634
00:29:07.751 --> 00:29:09.215
People blowing up people.

635
00:29:09.284 --> 00:29:10.818
maniacs streaming people
getting whacked.

636
00:29:10.887 --> 00:29:12.418
government upside down.

637
00:29:13.185 --> 00:29:14.491
Who's running things?

638
00:29:14.559 --> 00:29:15.723
What's whacked?

639
00:29:15.791 --> 00:29:17.925
Wasting people.

640
00:29:17.994 --> 00:29:19.524
Anybody else not okay with this?

641
00:29:19.593 --> 00:29:22.233
Michael.
where is this coming from?

642
00:29:22.302 --> 00:29:23.634
What?

643
00:29:23.703 --> 00:29:25.630
You know. all this.

644
00:29:25.699 --> 00:29:27.703
I'm talking about
the news every day.

645
00:29:27.771 --> 00:29:29.270
People getting blown away

646
00:29:29.339 --> 00:29:31.307
because they looked at someone
the wrong way.

647
00:29:31.376 --> 00:29:33.105
I mean. look at this country.
There's a revolution out there.

648
00:29:33.174 --> 00:29:34.305
You don't need a fucking reason.

649
00:29:34.373 --> 00:29:36.148
Just watch the language.
Michael.

650
00:29:36.217 --> 00:29:37.042
Okay?

651
00:29:37.111 --> 00:29:38.142
Getting into my character.

652
00:29:38.211 --> 00:29:39.784
Michael. listen.

653
00:29:39.853 --> 00:29:42.085
I understand about
all these social issues.

654
00:29:42.154 --> 00:29:44.421
everything going on out there
in the world.

655
00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:46.054
but you're 17.

656
00:29:46.123 --> 00:29:48.456
Don't get overwhelmed
by all that.

657
00:29:48.524 --> 00:29:50.921
This is the world
you all are leaving us.

658
00:29:51.691 --> 00:29:53.664
What are we supposed to do
with this mess?

659
00:29:53.733 --> 00:29:55.131
What I mean is just

660
00:29:55.199 --> 00:29:58.035
don't let all that
mess with who you are.

661
00:30:00.135 --> 00:30:01.874
So. who are you hiding behind?

662
00:30:04.278 --> 00:30:05.405
Excuse me?

663
00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.640
What does that mean?

664
00:30:07.709 --> 00:30:08.777
Nothing.

665
00:30:08.845 --> 00:30:10.311
I didn't mean nothing.

666
00:30:15.081 --> 00:30:16.548
Listen.

667
00:30:16.616 --> 00:30:19.419
-If I can be of any assistance--
-No. You can't.

668
00:30:21.958 --> 00:30:23.395
I didn't mean it that way.

669
00:30:23.464 --> 00:30:24.893
It's not you. I'm sorry.

670
00:30:24.962 --> 00:30:26.498
It's okay. Michael.

671
00:30:26.567 --> 00:30:28.025
I get it. I understand.

672
00:30:28.094 --> 00:30:29.330
This isn't easy.

673
00:30:31.066 --> 00:30:32.630
This character. I mean.

674
00:30:32.698 --> 00:30:35.471
things are just
a little messed up in his head.

675
00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:36.875
A little?

676
00:30:36.944 --> 00:30:38.674
Hey. can I go
to the bathroom?

677
00:30:38.742 --> 00:30:40.539
Jason. not now.

678
00:30:42.415 --> 00:30:43.877
What?

679
00:30:43.946 --> 00:30:45.812
I said it's a character.

680
00:30:45.881 --> 00:30:47.753
Yeah. buddy.

681
00:30:47.822 --> 00:30:49.718
Then how did you
slip through the cracks?

682
00:30:49.787 --> 00:30:51.052
Okay. You know what.

683
00:30:51.121 --> 00:30:53.321
I am gonna call
a bathroom break.

684
00:31:00.027 --> 00:31:01.461
I'm watching you.

685
00:31:03.034 --> 00:31:05.399
Ms. Casey.
You're up.

686
00:31:09.903 --> 00:31:11.376
Hmm.

687
00:31:11.445 --> 00:31:14.744
Um. my character.

688
00:31:14.813 --> 00:31:19.611
So she's lived past lives.

689
00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:26.618
She also knows what people
are thinking and feeling.

690
00:31:30.564 --> 00:31:32.161
I mean. think about that.

691
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:33.927
And to know what
the person next to you

692
00:31:33.996 --> 00:31:36.162
is really thinking.

693
00:31:36.231 --> 00:31:40.005
I mean. talk about the chaos.

694
00:31:45.411 --> 00:31:46.538
Anyway--

695
00:31:46.607 --> 00:31:47.874
Is there something
we don't know about?

696
00:31:48.476 --> 00:31:50.076
You would say
some shit like that.

697
00:31:50.144 --> 00:31:52.276
Listen. my character.

698
00:31:52.345 --> 00:31:54.580
she can see inside people.

699
00:31:55.786 --> 00:31:56.914
That's stupid.

700
00:31:56.983 --> 00:31:58.353
Why?

701
00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.257
I don't know.
It's just stupid.

702
00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:04.356
Afraid to know the truth.

703
00:32:04.425 --> 00:32:06.063
what people really think
about you?

704
00:32:06.132 --> 00:32:08.796
-Whatever.
-How about your teachers?

705
00:32:08.865 --> 00:32:10.101
Or Mr. Faulk.

706
00:32:12.373 --> 00:32:13.637
Uh-hmm.

707
00:32:13.706 --> 00:32:15.040
Michael's right.

708
00:32:16.039 --> 00:32:18.536
We all live a damn lie.

709
00:32:18.605 --> 00:32:22.476
We pretend out there.
don't we?

710
00:32:29.448 --> 00:32:30.989
I changed my mind.

711
00:32:31.058 --> 00:32:32.717
This is gonna be
a great partnership.

712
00:32:33.956 --> 00:32:35.190
All right. Casey.

713
00:32:35.259 --> 00:32:36.994
A lot of possibilities
with this.

714
00:32:37.063 --> 00:32:40.861
Well. it's all I gotta say
for now.

715
00:32:48.571 --> 00:32:51.010
All right.
Best for last. right?

716
00:32:51.808 --> 00:32:53.143
Yeah.

717
00:32:53.212 --> 00:32:55.306
Give Max
your full attention.

718
00:32:55.375 --> 00:32:57.049
Yeah. that's likely.

719
00:33:05.192 --> 00:33:08.456
In keeping with this theme
of being different.

720
00:33:09.563 --> 00:33:10.590
I'm thinking...

721
00:33:12.765 --> 00:33:15.334
my character is a--

722
00:33:15.403 --> 00:33:16.662
he's a...

723
00:33:24.438 --> 00:33:26.309
We're all born with something.

724
00:33:27.775 --> 00:33:31.547
And something inside.
it makes us different.

725
00:33:32.317 --> 00:33:35.479
But sometimes we...
hide from that.

726
00:33:35.548 --> 00:33:38.420
from being who we really are.

727
00:33:39.754 --> 00:33:41.760
You know. I can be
running down the sidelines

728
00:33:41.829 --> 00:33:43.423
inches away from the end zone

729
00:33:43.491 --> 00:33:46.497
but my head
is someplace else.

730
00:33:46.566 --> 00:33:47.594
Yeah.

731
00:33:48.363 --> 00:33:51.863
Anyway. this character of mine

732
00:33:51.932 --> 00:33:57.109
is lost like that
but he finds peace when he...

733
00:33:59.378 --> 00:34:01.740
It's kind of stupid
but. like. when he...

734
00:34:03.812 --> 00:34:08.450
like when he danced ballet
or something like that.

735
00:34:10.222 --> 00:34:14.093
You know.
just a certain freedom.

736
00:34:15.491 --> 00:34:17.688
And using
this motivation. um...

737
00:34:17.756 --> 00:34:20.231
Go ahead. Max.
Stay with it.

738
00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.997
Yeah. he's--
I'm thinking he's-- he--

739
00:34:25.066 --> 00:34:26.904
Okay.

740
00:34:26.973 --> 00:34:28.840
-So?
-What are you looking at?

741
00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:30.768
-You tell me.
-Let him finish.

742
00:34:30.837 --> 00:34:33.044
Yeah. you know what.
I'm done.

743
00:34:33.112 --> 00:34:35.043
I'm not in the mood.
all right?

744
00:34:35.111 --> 00:34:36.808
-Oh.
-I said my piece.

745
00:34:37.848 --> 00:34:39.118
I get it.

746
00:34:39.883 --> 00:34:41.817
Get what?

747
00:34:41.886 --> 00:34:43.149
Are we done here?

748
00:34:43.218 --> 00:34:44.985
No. we're not.

749
00:34:45.855 --> 00:34:50.056
Okay. First of all. Michael.
lose the mass murder guy.

750
00:34:50.125 --> 00:34:51.154
Not buying it.

751
00:34:53.932 --> 00:34:55.298
What's the problem?

752
00:34:55.367 --> 00:34:56.495
Do I have to spell it out?

753
00:34:56.563 --> 00:34:58.600
Do something else.
Okay?

754
00:34:58.669 --> 00:35:00.867
And. Casey. look.
like I said. really original.

755
00:35:00.936 --> 00:35:04.770
But make sure you're not hiding
behind those superpowers. okay?

756
00:35:05.604 --> 00:35:08.279
Hiding behind superpowers?

757
00:35:09.147 --> 00:35:10.474
What if they're not superpowers?

758
00:35:10.543 --> 00:35:12.117
What if she just thinks

759
00:35:12.186 --> 00:35:13.684
that she can read
people's thoughts.

760
00:35:13.753 --> 00:35:15.717
but she can't?

761
00:35:15.786 --> 00:35:17.683
Hey guys. look.
if it were any other class.

762
00:35:17.752 --> 00:35:19.387
there'd be a proctor
standing over you

763
00:35:19.456 --> 00:35:21.655
while you fill out ovals.
Is that better?

764
00:35:21.723 --> 00:35:23.525
-I mean. do you--
-This is all bullshit.

765
00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:27.357
No. not you.
Not you. Tommy.

766
00:35:27.426 --> 00:35:28.826
Not you guys.

767
00:35:28.895 --> 00:35:30.599
So here's my picks
for the fourth race.

768
00:35:30.668 --> 00:35:33.735
I got Jack Wacker.
uh. Rock Dandy and Lost Ideal.

769
00:35:33.804 --> 00:35:37.101
Guys. you have been
here all semester. okay?

770
00:35:37.169 --> 00:35:41.641
You-- Stop pretending
you don't know how to do this.

771
00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:43.281
Yeah. I'm still tight.
scored a couple.

772
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:45.650
And go prep your scenes.
like somewhere else. Go.

773
00:35:45.719 --> 00:35:47.417
Out there. Go.

774
00:35:48.555 --> 00:35:49.513
Go.

775
00:35:54.657 --> 00:35:56.426
Oh. you guys
stay on school grounds.

776
00:35:58.897 --> 00:36:00.497
I take this.

777
00:36:00.565 --> 00:36:02.298
<i> ♪ Is this heaven</i>
<i>Is this Mars? ♪</i>

778
00:36:02.367 --> 00:36:04.234
Yup.
We chip the track.

779
00:36:04.303 --> 00:36:06.338
<i> ♪ So touch me again ♪</i>

780
00:36:06.407 --> 00:36:08.637
<i>♪ We could travel out</i>
<i>Or stay in ♪</i>

781
00:36:08.705 --> 00:36:10.706
<i>♪ You know</i>
<i>We're gonna stay in ♪</i>

782
00:36:10.775 --> 00:36:13.841

783
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:17.181
<i>♪ Because this feel good</i>
<i>Like a California summer time ♪</i>

784
00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:18.844
Why'd you help me out
back there?

785
00:36:20.649 --> 00:36:22.485
I thought you could
read my mind?

786
00:36:25.089 --> 00:36:26.188
I'm working on it.

787
00:36:26.257 --> 00:36:27.985
What did you mean back there?

788
00:36:29.656 --> 00:36:30.962
What are you talking about?

789
00:36:31.031 --> 00:36:32.895
About reading people's minds.

790
00:36:32.964 --> 00:36:34.226
Talking about me?

791
00:36:34.295 --> 00:36:36.429
No. Hell. no.

792
00:36:36.498 --> 00:36:37.935
But you wouldn't understand.

793
00:36:38.004 --> 00:36:39.964
-No?
-No.

794
00:36:44.976 --> 00:36:47.372
Okay.

795
00:36:47.441 --> 00:36:49.380
So what about our scene?

796
00:36:50.311 --> 00:36:52.946
Um. man.

797
00:36:53.014 --> 00:36:56.288
don't even know. but we got to
figure out something.

798
00:36:58.857 --> 00:36:59.855
Okay.

799
00:36:59.924 --> 00:37:01.986
So...

800
00:37:04.395 --> 00:37:05.590
You know you haven't said

801
00:37:05.659 --> 00:37:09.030
two words to me before today.

802
00:37:09.099 --> 00:37:10.665
More than two?

803
00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:13.404
What were they?

804
00:37:14.536 --> 00:37:16.341
Can't think of them can you?

805
00:37:17.837 --> 00:37:19.604
<i> ♪ Good. good. good ♪</i>

806
00:37:19.673 --> 00:37:22.109
<i>♪ Good. good. good ♪</i>

807
00:37:43.002 --> 00:37:44.435
Smells weird out here.

808
00:37:44.504 --> 00:37:46.769
Would you be more comfortable
in the field?

809
00:37:46.838 --> 00:37:47.966
Why?

810
00:37:49.206 --> 00:37:51.369
You play football?

811
00:37:51.438 --> 00:37:53.642
Yeah. right.

812
00:37:55.344 --> 00:37:58.110
So you do ballet?

813
00:37:58.179 --> 00:37:59.379
No.

814
00:37:59.447 --> 00:38:01.483
In the scene. I mean.

815
00:38:01.552 --> 00:38:04.783
Yeah. in the--
yeah. in the scene.

816
00:38:04.852 --> 00:38:06.820
Why are you being
so sensitive about this?

817
00:38:06.889 --> 00:38:08.452
Why don't you tell me why
are you so gloom and doom

818
00:38:08.521 --> 00:38:09.757
all the time?

819
00:38:10.524 --> 00:38:11.990
I have my reasons.

820
00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.533
Look. I'm just trying to do
the assignment.

821
00:38:15.602 --> 00:38:18.700
Okay? Isn't that now here
what we're supposed to be doing?

822
00:38:19.972 --> 00:38:20.969
Yeah. I guess.

823
00:38:21.038 --> 00:38:22.407
Okay.

824
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:25.904
All right.
So. I was thinking

825
00:38:25.973 --> 00:38:30.813
that I'm a singer
and you're a dancer?

826
00:38:31.649 --> 00:38:35.948
And let's say that
maybe we're a couple.

827
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:39.391
-Okay?
-Yeah. Fine.

828
00:38:40.288 --> 00:38:41.690
And...

829
00:38:43.325 --> 00:38:45.456
what if you're...

830
00:38:45.525 --> 00:38:46.826
What if I'm what?

831
00:38:46.895 --> 00:38:48.794
What if you're gay?
Would that work?

832
00:38:48.862 --> 00:38:50.064
What the fuck
does that mean?

833
00:38:50.133 --> 00:38:51.370
What?

834
00:38:52.202 --> 00:38:53.438
What did I say?

835
00:38:54.436 --> 00:38:55.772
What's wrong with you?

836
00:38:55.841 --> 00:38:57.134
Max?

837
00:39:05.479 --> 00:39:06.676
Whoa!

838
00:39:06.745 --> 00:39:08.486
What is this place?

839
00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:11.082
I know. isn't it cool?

840
00:39:12.458 --> 00:39:14.591
Yeah. I found this place
under the theater.

841
00:39:15.592 --> 00:39:17.594
Should we really be
in here?

842
00:39:21.299 --> 00:39:22.700
That's the 911.

843
00:39:22.769 --> 00:39:23.963
Oh.

844
00:39:35.613 --> 00:39:37.180
The guy can't snap
a fishing peace.

845
00:39:37.248 --> 00:39:38.615
What's going on here?

846
00:39:39.415 --> 00:39:42.047
So. why do you drink?

847
00:39:46.259 --> 00:39:48.085
Why do you take this class?

848
00:39:48.154 --> 00:39:51.056
Same as you. thought it would be
an easy grade.

849
00:39:52.832 --> 00:39:54.327
And?

850
00:39:54.396 --> 00:39:55.495
And it's hard.

851
00:39:55.564 --> 00:39:57.230
Telling the truth is hard.

852
00:39:57.299 --> 00:39:59.135
Yeah.

853
00:39:59.204 --> 00:40:00.868
So why do you drink?

854
00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:05.169
It's the only thing
I could count on.

855
00:40:06.142 --> 00:40:07.479
Cop out?

856
00:40:09.643 --> 00:40:11.048
What's your story?

857
00:40:11.116 --> 00:40:12.179
Oh. here we go.

858
00:40:12.248 --> 00:40:13.816
What?

859
00:40:13.885 --> 00:40:15.984
You. with your fucking
Housewives of Bel-Air family

860
00:40:16.053 --> 00:40:17.155
and all?

861
00:40:17.224 --> 00:40:18.822
Do you have to swear so much?

862
00:40:19.825 --> 00:40:21.557
-You started this.
-Yeah. well. I think we should

863
00:40:21.626 --> 00:40:24.796
start working on our scene now.
don't you?

864
00:40:24.865 --> 00:40:26.161
Whatever.

865
00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:28.097
Will you stop?

866
00:40:28.166 --> 00:40:29.400
Why do you care?

867
00:40:29.469 --> 00:40:30.994
I wanna know
what can be so bad.

868
00:40:31.063 --> 00:40:32.702
you wanna blow up
the whole world?

869
00:40:33.635 --> 00:40:35.269
It's none of your concern.

870
00:40:35.338 --> 00:40:36.772
What?

871
00:40:38.174 --> 00:40:39.943
Hey.

872
00:40:40.012 --> 00:40:41.238
Shit.

873
00:40:41.307 --> 00:40:42.808
What the hell
is going on up there?

874
00:40:42.877 --> 00:40:44.407
-What? No.
-Just give it me.

875
00:40:44.476 --> 00:40:46.078
-Just give it to me.
-I'm not gonna give it to you.

876
00:40:46.147 --> 00:40:47.915
I'm gonna put it away.
Oh. my God. Stupid.

877
00:40:49.615 --> 00:40:50.852
Hey. guys.

878
00:40:55.193 --> 00:40:56.594
I hear you.

879
00:40:57.996 --> 00:40:59.728
Aha.

880
00:40:59.797 --> 00:41:01.192
So. what the hell's
going on up there?

881
00:41:02.168 --> 00:41:03.532
Rehearsing our scene.

882
00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:05.065
Yeah.
I'm not buying that crap.

883
00:41:05.133 --> 00:41:06.834
No. he's right.
We're just rehearsing up here.

884
00:41:06.903 --> 00:41:08.273
Okay. both of you.
bring your hormones.

885
00:41:08.341 --> 00:41:09.772
Come on down.
Let's go.

886
00:41:09.841 --> 00:41:12.940
Time to get back to class.
Romeo and Juliet.

887
00:41:14.147 --> 00:41:15.679
Okay. back to class.

888
00:41:16.609 --> 00:41:18.181
Nice try.

889
00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:19.782
You. I'm watching.

890
00:41:28.253 --> 00:41:30.259
You're always doing
what you think

891
00:41:30.328 --> 00:41:31.827
people expect you to do.

892
00:41:33.059 --> 00:41:35.830
No.
Then my name would be Max.

893
00:41:35.899 --> 00:41:39.003
Well. this whole
soul image of yours.

894
00:41:39.071 --> 00:41:40.371
Who cares?

895
00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:43.201
Someone would
if you just...

896
00:41:45.342 --> 00:41:46.540
Never mind.

897
00:41:46.609 --> 00:41:48.073
What if I told you exactly

898
00:41:48.142 --> 00:41:50.879
where you're sitting
every day this semester?

899
00:41:52.651 --> 00:41:53.913
Don't play with my head
like that.

900
00:41:53.981 --> 00:41:55.884
You do that enough
to yourself.

901
00:41:56.650 --> 00:41:58.315
Shut up. Jason.

902
00:42:02.024 --> 00:42:04.288
I don't believe
what everybody says. by the way.

903
00:42:05.893 --> 00:42:07.863
I think you're pretty chill.

904
00:42:09.832 --> 00:42:12.296
I heard some things
about you.

905
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:14.672
Yeah?

906
00:42:15.537 --> 00:42:16.839
You believe it?

907
00:42:19.976 --> 00:42:22.172
Just can't imagine
that I'm your type.

908
00:42:22.241 --> 00:42:23.910
How could you know
what my type is

909
00:42:23.979 --> 00:42:26.145
if we only said
two words to each other?

910
00:42:28.113 --> 00:42:29.918
You're afraid
of a compliment?

911
00:42:32.757 --> 00:42:34.824
I thought
you could read my mind?

Hey. guys. what's going on?

944
00:44:17.497 --> 00:44:18.926
Who's gonna clean up this mess?

945
00:44:18.994 --> 00:44:21.295
Come on back to class.
Come on.

946
00:44:21.364 --> 00:44:23.064
Come on.

947
00:44:24.732 --> 00:44:26.133
And we're back.

948
00:44:26.202 --> 00:44:28.401
Ms. Long. why are we
sitting like this now?

949
00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:30.441
Yeah. Why aren't we
on the ground like usual?

950
00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:32.210
Yeah. A little close. you know?

951
00:44:32.279 --> 00:44:33.743
Yes. we are close.

952
00:44:33.812 --> 00:44:35.843
We are trying
to connect. people.

953
00:44:35.912 --> 00:44:38.348
Yeah. I'm so sick
of this bullshit.

954
00:44:38.417 --> 00:44:39.481
Be honest. Open up.

955
00:44:39.549 --> 00:44:40.785
We all go home.

956
00:44:41.721 --> 00:44:42.913
You can leave
any time you want.

957
00:44:42.982 --> 00:44:45.255
Yeah. you all lie.

958
00:44:45.324 --> 00:44:46.384
I'm so over this.

959
00:44:50.462 --> 00:44:51.488
Do you wanna know?

960
00:44:52.797 --> 00:44:54.128
Okay.
Let's all be honest.

961
00:44:56.666 --> 00:44:58.330
Somebody I know.
Okay?

962
00:44:59.471 --> 00:45:00.772
She cared about me.

963
00:45:01.767 --> 00:45:03.005
Me.

964
00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:06.437
She tried to...

965
00:45:09.614 --> 00:45:11.079
She took a bunch of pills.

966
00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:14.814
Okay?

967
00:45:14.882 --> 00:45:16.349
Are you all happy now?

968
00:45:16.417 --> 00:45:19.054
I mean. she asked for help.
and nobody cared.

969
00:45:20.393 --> 00:45:21.518
What happened to her?

970
00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:24.521
-Did she--
-No. She didn't die.

971
00:45:27.465 --> 00:45:28.492
She was pregnant.

972
00:45:30.863 --> 00:45:32.197
What?

973
00:45:32.266 --> 00:45:33.771
What the fuck
are you looking at?

974
00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:35.534
No. no.
I didn't mean it like that.

975
00:45:35.603 --> 00:45:37.208
No.

976
00:45:37.277 --> 00:45:38.304
No. not mine.

977
00:45:41.273 --> 00:45:42.847
How does anyone deal with that?

978
00:45:44.109 --> 00:45:46.283
But she understood me.

979
00:45:46.352 --> 00:45:47.918
She was my girl.

980
00:45:49.622 --> 00:45:51.252
So. she came to me for help.

981
00:45:52.255 --> 00:45:54.926
You know how hard
it was for her to do that?

982
00:45:54.994 --> 00:45:58.258
You know. I hated her
for what she did to me.

983
00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:01.658
I don't know what to do.

984
00:46:01.726 --> 00:46:03.833
Michael. you can't control
what other people do

985
00:46:03.902 --> 00:46:05.499
no matter how hard
you try. okay?

986
00:46:05.568 --> 00:46:06.870
Trust me.

987
00:46:06.939 --> 00:46:08.405
So you can't blame
yourself for this.

988
00:46:08.474 --> 00:46:09.674
Ms. Long is right.

989
00:46:09.742 --> 00:46:11.139
You know.
I was mad.

990
00:46:11.208 --> 00:46:12.305
I told you.
"How could you do this to me?"

991
00:46:13.611 --> 00:46:15.680
She cried and cried.

992
00:46:15.749 --> 00:46:18.443
I still loved her.
Didn't matter.

993
00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:20.915
He was with this
some son of a bitch

994
00:46:20.984 --> 00:46:22.348
who promised
her the world.

995
00:46:25.389 --> 00:46:28.188
Uh. Ms. Long. let's take a five
minute break outside. please.

996
00:46:28.257 --> 00:46:30.325
No. not now.
Not like this.

997
00:46:30.393 --> 00:46:32.489
-Michael. is she okay?
-Uh. we really should.

998
00:46:32.558 --> 00:46:35.227
And you.
you teach us how to read.

999
00:46:35.296 --> 00:46:37.362
but you don't teach us
how to live.

1000
00:46:37.431 --> 00:46:39.766
I mean. he told her this kid.
His kid.

1001
00:46:39.835 --> 00:46:41.001
Said it was her problem.

1002
00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:42.269
I mean.
her fucking problem.

1003
00:46:44.369 --> 00:46:46.306
Goddamit.
I did nothing.

1004
00:46:48.239 --> 00:46:50.380
What happened to her?

1005
00:46:50.449 --> 00:46:51.843
I just told you.

1006
00:46:51.912 --> 00:46:53.778
No. not that.

1007
00:46:53.847 --> 00:46:55.312
What?

1008
00:46:55.381 --> 00:46:57.719
Michael.
what about the baby?

1009
00:46:57.788 --> 00:46:59.053
You say this to me now?

1010
00:46:59.122 --> 00:47:00.924
Why don't guys
just back off. okay?

1011
00:47:00.993 --> 00:47:02.555
She was just
asking a question.

1012
00:47:02.623 --> 00:47:04.091
All right. look.
I will handle this. okay?

1013
00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:05.927
All right.
enough already.

1014
00:47:05.996 --> 00:47:07.493
Maybe I will
call a break.

1015
00:47:07.561 --> 00:47:10.401
Do you need to talk
about this outside. maybe?

1016
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:12.002
She had an abortion.

1017
00:47:14.606 --> 00:47:16.006
I drove her to it.

1018
00:47:17.975 --> 00:47:20.410
If I ever find out
who he is.

1019
00:47:20.479 --> 00:47:21.572
He's so dead.

1020
00:47:23.879 --> 00:47:25.345
Now. just leave me alone.

1021
00:47:28.349 --> 00:47:31.122
-Ms. Long.
-I'm calling a break.

1022
00:47:31.925 --> 00:47:34.919
Michael. I'll be in
my office if you need me.

1023
00:47:34.988 --> 00:47:36.455
I'll be in mine.

1024
00:47:37.324 --> 00:47:39.898
Come on.
I can't do anything.

1025
00:47:41.731 --> 00:47:43.066
So. don't worry.

1026
00:47:45.233 --> 00:47:47.466
It's all okay.
We got you.

1027
00:47:54.943 --> 00:47:56.240
Listen. It's okay.

1028
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:58.276
No. No.
Listen to me.

1029
00:47:58.345 --> 00:48:00.015
You don't think
I get it?

1030
00:48:00.084 --> 00:48:01.279
You don't think
I see what you're doing?

1031
00:48:01.348 --> 00:48:02.578
It's not--
I'm gonna shut this down.

1032
00:48:02.647 --> 00:48:03.918
Just work with me here.

1033
00:48:03.987 --> 00:48:05.151
Give me a chance
to work with--

1034
00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:06.884
No. Listen. I've had it.
I've had it.

1035
00:48:06.953 --> 00:48:09.026
You're not equipped or trained
to deal with this. Miranda.

1036
00:48:09.095 --> 00:48:10.856
I know it's not
the most conventional way.

1037
00:48:10.924 --> 00:48:12.595
You think?

1038
00:48:12.663 --> 00:48:13.862
It's not funny.

1039
00:48:13.931 --> 00:48:15.161
I'm watching them
in there.

1040
00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:16.393
You're tearing
them apart.

1041
00:48:16.462 --> 00:48:18.131
Don't worry.
I'll handle it.

1042
00:48:18.199 --> 00:48:20.199
I don't see
it that way.

1043
00:48:20.268 --> 00:48:21.599
Thank God
I'm here today.

1044
00:48:34.048 --> 00:48:35.514
What's the matter?

1045
00:48:36.888 --> 00:48:39.054
I'm fucked up.
you know?

1046
00:48:39.123 --> 00:48:41.025
So. what do you
think about it?

1047
00:48:42.022 --> 00:48:43.959
About what?

1048
00:48:44.028 --> 00:48:46.929
About what
Michael just said.

1049
00:48:46.998 --> 00:48:48.661
you know.
if you had to--

1050
00:48:48.729 --> 00:48:52.403
if you were put in that
situation and-- never mind.

1051
00:48:52.471 --> 00:48:53.864
Over what?

1052
00:48:53.933 --> 00:48:56.404
If you have to deal
with something like that.

1053
00:48:56.473 --> 00:49:00.341
Either way. it doesn't change
who you are. right?

1054
00:49:01.174 --> 00:49:02.739
No. I don't think so.

1055
00:49:07.048 --> 00:49:08.646
Change the subject?

1056
00:49:10.021 --> 00:49:13.389
-Okay.
-Hey. Jessie.

1057
00:49:14.359 --> 00:49:17.093
Look. I-- I'm sorry
for sounding off right there.

1058
00:49:17.162 --> 00:49:19.263
It's just-- I don't know
what I was thinking.

1059
00:49:19.332 --> 00:49:22.365
I mean. I know you're just
trying to do the assignment.

1060
00:49:22.434 --> 00:49:25.201
and-- well. this class just gets
in my head sometimes. you know?

1061
00:49:25.269 --> 00:49:29.002
It's just--
it's just ridiculous. but--

1062
00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:30.233
Oh. Jessie. are you okay?

1063
00:49:30.302 --> 00:49:31.941
Oh. yeah. I'm okay.

1064
00:49:32.009 --> 00:49:34.345
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

1065
00:49:34.414 --> 00:49:35.446
Jessie!

1066
00:49:35.515 --> 00:49:36.714
I'm okay. Max.

1067
00:49:36.783 --> 00:49:39.547
Tell me something
about you.

1068
00:49:39.616 --> 00:49:40.878
Why?

1069
00:49:40.947 --> 00:49:42.451
Why not?

1070
00:49:43.287 --> 00:49:46.420
I don't know.
What do you wanna know?

1071
00:49:46.488 --> 00:49:49.089
Anything.
I just wanna get to know you.

1072
00:49:49.158 --> 00:49:51.390
And what if
I disappoint you?

1073
00:49:51.458 --> 00:49:53.796
Disappoint me?
I just met you.

1074
00:49:53.864 --> 00:49:55.464
Why would you think that?

1075
00:49:55.533 --> 00:49:58.294
Because some things I don't
even like thinking about.

1076
00:49:58.363 --> 00:50:00.069
so I don't know why

1077
00:50:00.138 --> 00:50:02.168
I don't wanna tell
somebody else.

1078
00:50:02.237 --> 00:50:04.603
Well. I want you to want to.

1079
00:50:07.839 --> 00:50:09.307
Hey. should
I get you some help?

1080
00:50:09.376 --> 00:50:11.445
No. No. it's fine.

1081
00:50:11.514 --> 00:50:13.514
-Are you sure?
-I'm fine. Max. Okay?

1082
00:50:13.582 --> 00:50:15.551
-You don't look okay.
-I know. I'm okay. Max.

1083
00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:16.648
I'm fine.

1084
00:50:18.656 --> 00:50:19.957
I'm okay.

1085
00:50:20.026 --> 00:50:25.060
It's just-- Please
don't tell anyone. okay?

1086
00:50:25.129 --> 00:50:27.859
Promise me
you won't tell.

1087
00:50:27.928 --> 00:50:29.863
I won't.

1088
00:50:29.932 --> 00:50:31.501
Okay. I promise.

1089
00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:33.004
Okay.

1090
00:50:38.271 --> 00:50:39.506
I'm okay.

1091
00:50:46.051 --> 00:50:50.886
They died in a car crash.
my parents.

1092
00:50:50.955 --> 00:50:52.286
I was like
three years old.

1093
00:50:52.354 --> 00:50:54.686
so I can barely
remember them.

1094
00:50:56.695 --> 00:50:58.396
Jason. um...

1095
00:50:58.465 --> 00:50:59.356
Yeah.

1096
00:50:59.424 --> 00:51:00.857
Hey. look. it's weird.

1097
00:51:00.926 --> 00:51:03.934
It's just like. it's like.
sometimes I can--

1098
00:51:04.002 --> 00:51:07.901
I can feel them.
I can hear them.

1099
00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:10.169
I can smell them

1100
00:51:10.237 --> 00:51:14.310
but I. uh. can't see 'em.

1101
00:51:16.913 --> 00:51:18.281
It's crazy. huh?

1102
00:51:19.416 --> 00:51:22.115
No. no.
Well. that's-- it's not crazy.

1103
00:51:22.184 --> 00:51:25.222
That's actually beautiful.

1104
00:51:28.393 --> 00:51:30.691
I never told anybody
at school that before.

1105
00:51:31.461 --> 00:51:33.760
If Faulk catches us
back here. he'll kill us.

1106
00:51:37.365 --> 00:51:39.034
What you did
back there?

1107
00:51:39.103 --> 00:51:42.738
-What?
-You're okay.

1108
00:51:42.806 --> 00:51:44.340
Thank you.

1109
00:51:47.573 --> 00:51:48.711
Hey. what
are you doing?

1110
00:51:48.779 --> 00:51:50.014
I need it.

1111
00:51:50.083 --> 00:51:51.413
No. I know
what you're thinking.

1112
00:51:51.481 --> 00:51:53.947
-Allie. please.
-No. you don't need it.

1113
00:51:54.015 --> 00:51:55.747
You don't.

1114
00:51:58.255 --> 00:51:59.988
I live with my uncle now.

1115
00:52:00.057 --> 00:52:01.688
he treats me like shit.

1116
00:52:01.757 --> 00:52:04.392
He makes me feel like a freakin'
hand me down all the time.

1117
00:52:04.461 --> 00:52:07.494
someone just given
away by the court.

1118
00:52:07.563 --> 00:52:12.335
Jason. I wouldn't
have asked actually.

1119
00:52:13.837 --> 00:52:15.239
It's okay.

1120
00:52:16.841 --> 00:52:18.341
A long time ago.

1121
00:52:19.673 --> 00:52:21.278
Look.
I'm still that same guy.

1122
00:52:21.346 --> 00:52:24.611
-Nothing's changed.
-It's different now.

1123
00:52:25.645 --> 00:52:28.278
Today will come
and go. okay?

1124
00:52:28.347 --> 00:52:30.485
That's not true.

1125
00:52:30.554 --> 00:52:33.217
Have you thought about
talking with someone?

1126
00:52:33.286 --> 00:52:36.352
Who? Faulk?

1127
00:52:36.421 --> 00:52:38.893
My parents?

1128
00:52:38.962 --> 00:52:40.396
What about me?

1129
00:52:41.262 --> 00:52:42.629
You can talk to me.

1130
00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:47.299
What happens when
I walk out this door?

1131
00:52:47.367 --> 00:52:50.868
You walk out with me.

1132
00:52:53.777 --> 00:52:55.345
Promise.

1133
00:52:59.281 --> 00:53:00.647
All right. guys.

1134
00:53:00.715 --> 00:53:02.918
I hope that break
helped you all reset.

1135
00:53:02.987 --> 00:53:04.954
clear their heads.

1136
00:53:05.022 --> 00:53:06.750
Listen. what Michael did.

1137
00:53:06.818 --> 00:53:08.854
proud of you
for opening up like that.

1138
00:53:08.923 --> 00:53:12.362
That took a lot of strength
and a lot of courage.

1139
00:53:12.431 --> 00:53:15.497
And maybe it will help
inspire all of you.

1140
00:53:17.267 --> 00:53:18.834
I wanna sing a song.

1141
00:53:18.903 --> 00:53:20.170
Song? What?

1142
00:53:20.239 --> 00:53:21.838
Jessie.
you know the assignment?

1143
00:53:21.907 --> 00:53:23.236
Yes. I do.

1144
00:53:23.305 --> 00:53:24.837
And you have a partner?

1145
00:53:24.906 --> 00:53:26.605
Yeah. I'm right here.
Jess. what's going on?

1146
00:53:26.673 --> 00:53:28.279
Yes.
I know I have a partner.

1147
00:53:28.347 --> 00:53:31.346
-Yeah. but it--
-Just one please. okay?

1148
00:53:31.415 --> 00:53:32.676
I know it's not
the assignment.

1149
00:53:32.745 --> 00:53:34.351
but it's the only
way for me to--

1150
00:53:34.419 --> 00:53:35.814
Look.
That's how we grade it.

1151
00:53:35.883 --> 00:53:38.083
I just-- I can't change
the rules right now.

1152
00:53:38.152 --> 00:53:39.085
I just...

1153
00:53:39.153 --> 00:53:40.588
Michael...

1154
00:53:42.191 --> 00:53:43.987
you spoke the truth?

1155
00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:51.269
Now I wanna speak
the truth. I'm sick.

1156
00:53:52.805 --> 00:53:54.404
Sick?

1157
00:53:56.336 --> 00:53:57.368
What do you mean?

1158
00:53:57.436 --> 00:53:59.409
I'm sick but...

1159
00:54:01.142 --> 00:54:02.478
it's okay.

1160
00:54:03.976 --> 00:54:07.116
It's okay now
that I talk about it.

1161
00:54:07.185 --> 00:54:09.749
What? Like the flu or something?

1162
00:54:11.549 --> 00:54:12.785
Or something.

1163
00:54:16.059 --> 00:54:17.955
I have cancer.

1164
00:54:21.829 --> 00:54:25.501
And it's weird
saying it out loud. um.

1165
00:54:29.804 --> 00:54:32.343
but I know I need
to say it out loud.

1166
00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:37.012
I have cancer.

1167
00:54:41.549 --> 00:54:43.720
Listen. outside when you...

1168
00:54:43.789 --> 00:54:45.488
Yeah.

1169
00:54:45.557 --> 00:54:50.053
It's a battle
and I'm trying not to lose.

1170
00:54:50.121 --> 00:54:53.628
But you guys. sometimes
I don't know what to do.

1171
00:54:53.696 --> 00:54:56.296
I can't breathe
and I'm just so scared.

1172
00:54:56.365 --> 00:54:58.265
Hey. can I help?

1173
00:54:58.333 --> 00:54:59.634
Do you need anything?

1174
00:55:03.104 --> 00:55:04.441
No.

1175
00:55:08.144 --> 00:55:09.309
I've got these.

1176
00:55:09.377 --> 00:55:12.378
Jessie. all this time?

1177
00:55:12.447 --> 00:55:14.180
How sick are you?

1178
00:55:14.249 --> 00:55:16.283
Jessie...

1179
00:55:16.351 --> 00:55:18.151
You're gonna be okay?

1180
00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:22.186
Like someday?

1181
00:55:22.255 --> 00:55:24.357
No.

1182
00:55:24.425 --> 00:55:26.694
No. I don't think so.

1183
00:55:32.703 --> 00:55:35.538
At least I look
at birthdays differently now.

1184
00:55:37.473 --> 00:55:39.569
They tell me that
it could be--

1185
00:55:39.638 --> 00:55:41.071
Maybe they're wrong?

1186
00:55:42.106 --> 00:55:43.577
To hell with
what they say.

1187
00:55:43.646 --> 00:55:44.848
No. Jessie.
they're wrong.

1188
00:55:44.917 --> 00:55:46.381
They have to be.

1189
00:55:46.450 --> 00:55:49.383
That's what
I tell myself.

1190
00:55:49.452 --> 00:55:51.686
But. yeah. I found singing.

1191
00:55:52.817 --> 00:55:56.219
And I'm not very good but.

1192
00:55:56.287 --> 00:56:00.196
yeah. it's. um.
it's become my best medicine.

1193
00:56:00.265 --> 00:56:02.196
I'm able to express my thoughts

1194
00:56:02.265 --> 00:56:03.699
and how I'm feeling

1195
00:56:03.767 --> 00:56:06.833
and everything that's
going on inside. and...

1196
00:56:06.902 --> 00:56:09.704
that's where I feel
like the most me again.

1197
00:56:11.403 --> 00:56:15.644
And. you know. being sick.
have a good time definitely.

1198
00:56:18.110 --> 00:56:21.012
I just got to take it
a day at a time.

1199
00:56:22.047 --> 00:56:27.458
So. right now.
I'm living for today

1200
00:56:30.328 --> 00:56:32.562
and then we'll get to tomorrow.

1201
00:56:34.333 --> 00:56:36.363
How are you doing?

1202
00:56:36.431 --> 00:56:37.928
Yeah. I'll make sure.

1203
00:56:37.997 --> 00:56:39.799
You don't feel
the hotdogs today?

1204
00:56:39.868 --> 00:56:42.836
Oh. my God.
I got some letter.

1205
00:56:43.936 --> 00:56:45.540
-Oh. that's cute.
-Yeah.

1206
00:56:45.609 --> 00:56:47.674
-He's kind of ugly.
-No. he's not.

1207
00:56:47.742 --> 00:56:49.645
-He's a ten.
-He's a ten?

1208
00:56:49.714 --> 00:56:52.408
I'll take it back. I'll tell you
I was gonna be ugly.

1209
00:56:52.476 --> 00:56:54.879
-Well. we'll grow into it.
-I'm sure you will.

1210
00:56:54.948 --> 00:56:56.920
He looks like
a young Johnny Depp.

1211
00:56:56.988 --> 00:56:58.049
I promise.

1212
00:57:01.554 --> 00:57:02.485
What is that?

1213
00:57:08.396 --> 00:57:09.733
What is that?

1214
00:57:09.802 --> 00:57:11.462
Hmm.

1215
00:57:11.530 --> 00:57:12.795
That song.

1216
00:57:12.863 --> 00:57:15.601
Something I'm working on.

1217
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:17.407
Something you're working on?

1218
00:57:17.475 --> 00:57:18.902
-You wrote like a song?
-Yeah.

1219
00:57:18.971 --> 00:57:21.772
-An original?
-Yeah.

1220
00:57:21.841 --> 00:57:23.572
It'd sound better with a guitar.

1221
00:57:23.641 --> 00:57:25.109
Guitar?

1222
00:57:29.855 --> 00:57:30.982
Max?

1223
00:57:31.051 --> 00:57:32.588
Hey. where do you
think you're going?

1224
00:57:32.657 --> 00:57:33.451
I'll be back
in a sec. Mr. Faulk.

1225
00:57:33.519 --> 00:57:35.024
All right.

1226
00:57:35.693 --> 00:57:37.523
-How are you doing?
-Nothing.

1227
00:57:37.592 --> 00:57:39.222
Are you gonna eat that?

1228
00:57:42.994 --> 00:57:44.568
Got it from the music room.

1229
00:57:44.636 --> 00:57:46.064
Make sure
it finds its way back.

1230

Wow. Jessie. Jessie.

1256
00:59:54.629 --> 00:59:56.095
That's insane.

1257
00:59:56.164 --> 00:59:59.362
That was really insane.
That's really nuts.

1258
01:00:07.647 --> 01:00:09.673
Hey. Max.
what's going on?

1259
01:00:09.742 --> 01:00:11.209
Everything okay?

1260
01:00:12.479 --> 01:00:13.680
Nothing.

1261
01:00:13.749 --> 01:00:18.922
Max. hey. just breathe.

1262
01:00:19.825 --> 01:00:22.154
Just be honest like
we were outside. okay?

1263
01:00:23.623 --> 01:00:25.091
Let it go.

1264
01:00:27.097 --> 01:00:28.958
Hey. guys.
something going on over there?

1265
01:00:29.026 --> 01:00:30.595
What's going on. guys?

1266
01:00:30.664 --> 01:00:32.765
Everything okay?

1267
01:00:32.834 --> 01:00:35.035
You know your dad's not up.

1268
01:00:41.511 --> 01:00:42.674
Can I say something?

1269
01:00:42.743 --> 01:00:44.308
Of course. anything.

1270
01:00:51.924 --> 01:00:53.350
I care about
getting out of here on time.

1271
01:00:53.419 --> 01:00:57.226
Jason. just--
Max. take your time.

1272
01:00:57.295 --> 01:00:58.322
Okay. Yeah.

1273
01:01:00.631 --> 01:01:01.996
Look. I'm just
trying to say...

1274
01:01:07.099 --> 01:01:09.004
I mean. who the hell are we?

1275
01:01:09.073 --> 01:01:11.868
I mean. something brought us
all here today. right?

1276
01:01:11.937 --> 01:01:13.711
What Michael said.

1277
01:01:15.477 --> 01:01:16.912
Jessie.

1278
01:01:19.312 --> 01:01:21.884
Why does it matter
what people think?

1279
01:01:22.886 --> 01:01:26.185
You. Michael.
you made me think.

1280
01:01:27.158 --> 01:01:28.319
You.

1281
01:01:28.387 --> 01:01:32.026
You living for today.
not being afraid.

1282
01:01:34.229 --> 01:01:37.361
Why don't we all do that. right?
Live for ourselves.

1283
01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:40.330
Not for what my dad wants me

1284
01:01:40.399 --> 01:01:43.136
or any parent wants
any of us to be.

1285
01:01:45.106 --> 01:01:48.273
You don't have
to repeat their mistakes.

1286
01:01:51.911 --> 01:01:53.751
Live your life. Max.

1287
01:01:55.316 --> 01:01:58.151
That's what my mom
would say to me sometimes.

1288
01:01:59.951 --> 01:02:01.755
Live your life.

1289
01:02:01.824 --> 01:02:04.894
She would whisper it in my ear.

1290
01:02:06.561 --> 01:02:08.161
She knew.

1291
01:02:09.896 --> 01:02:11.498
She knew what?

1292
01:02:11.567 --> 01:02:13.765
She knew me.

1293
01:02:13.834 --> 01:02:15.806
And what does that mean?

1294
01:02:16.705 --> 01:02:17.933
My dad would kill me.

1295
01:02:18.002 --> 01:02:19.607
He would what?

1296
01:02:19.675 --> 01:02:21.576
Forget he ever had a son.

1297
01:02:21.644 --> 01:02:22.807
Why would he do that?

1298
01:02:22.875 --> 01:02:24.809
It's okay. Max.

1299
01:02:24.878 --> 01:02:26.714
It's not. actually.

1300
01:02:26.783 --> 01:02:28.146
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

1301
01:02:28.215 --> 01:02:29.519
Hey. hey. hey.
where are you going?

1302
01:02:29.588 --> 01:02:30.852
It's not gonna change anything.

1303
01:02:30.921 --> 01:02:32.384
-Listen.
-Go for it. Max.

1304
01:02:32.452 --> 01:02:34.550
Max. it's called
unconditional love.

1305
01:02:35.922 --> 01:02:37.255
He'll stop loving me.

1306
01:02:37.324 --> 01:02:38.927
No.
Why would you say that?

1307
01:02:38.996 --> 01:02:41.062
Because parents
fuck everything up.

1308
01:02:44.035 --> 01:02:46.701
Look. if it's affecting
your life like this.

1309
01:02:46.770 --> 01:02:48.735
you have got to confront him.

1310
01:02:48.804 --> 01:02:50.169
I say just go for it. man.

1311
01:02:50.238 --> 01:02:51.705
If it's like
tearing you up.

1312
01:02:51.773 --> 01:02:53.073
maybe he'd understand.

1313
01:02:53.142 --> 01:02:54.377
Maybe he doesn't
wanna talk about it.

1314
01:02:54.446 --> 01:02:56.576
Look. I'm gay. okay?

1315
01:02:57.876 --> 01:02:59.113
Dude.

1316
01:02:59.911 --> 01:03:01.148
Really?

1317
01:03:02.847 --> 01:03:04.250
I'm gay.

1318
01:03:08.122 --> 01:03:10.191
We share
the locker room together.

1319
01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:11.594
-Oh. fuck off. dude.
-Jason. leave him alone.

1320
01:03:11.663 --> 01:03:13.028
Jason. that's not funny.

1321
01:03:13.096 --> 01:03:14.525
Jason. dude.
shut the hell up.

1322
01:03:14.593 --> 01:03:15.996
Can't you see
how difficult this was for him?

1323
01:03:16.065 --> 01:03:17.364
I know. I know.
I mean--

1324
01:03:17.433 --> 01:03:18.527
Miranda.

1325
01:03:18.596 --> 01:03:20.100
I mean. he could've
said something.

1326
01:03:20.169 --> 01:03:21.397
-Said what?
-Fuck you.

1327
01:03:21.466 --> 01:03:22.902
-Shut up.
-Both of you.

1328
01:03:22.971 --> 01:03:25.370
-Please.
-Take it down.

1329
01:03:29.545 --> 01:03:30.881
My dad...

1330
01:03:32.550 --> 01:03:34.509
they would kill me.

1331
01:03:34.578 --> 01:03:36.519
And what
about your mom?

1332
01:03:36.587 --> 01:03:38.188
I can tell she knows.

1333
01:03:39.124 --> 01:03:41.089
-Won't talk about it though.
-Listen. Max.

1334
01:03:41.157 --> 01:03:42.251
we have some really
good counselors here

1335
01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:43.858
if you wanna talk to somebody.

1336
01:03:43.927 --> 01:03:46.061
Oh. you mean with
someone like you?

1337
01:03:50.996 --> 01:03:52.903
Great class.

1338
01:03:58.806 --> 01:04:00.107
Okay.

1339
01:04:00.176 --> 01:04:03.244
Allie. Michael.
what you got for me?

1340
01:04:03.312 --> 01:04:05.343
Oh. we're still kind of
working on our scene.

1341
01:04:05.412 --> 01:04:07.248
-We're not done yet.
-Uh-hmm.

1342
01:04:07.317 --> 01:04:09.212
Well. she wants to do
something where I'm standing

1343
01:04:09.281 --> 01:04:10.884
like at the edge of a building.

1344
01:04:10.953 --> 01:04:12.280
She's talking me down from it.

1345
01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:13.753
I don't know. It's stupid.

1346
01:04:13.822 --> 01:04:15.087
I thought it would help.

1347
01:04:15.156 --> 01:04:16.585
What does
that have to do

1348
01:04:16.654 --> 01:04:18.258
with what we were talking
about before. huh?

1349
01:04:18.327 --> 01:04:20.130
Like. what were you
talking about. Joanne?

1350
01:04:20.199 --> 01:04:21.760
I mean. how do you-- how does
any of that come into the scene?

1351
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:23.362
-Joanne?
-Yeah.

1352
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:25.498
-You said Joanne.
-Yeah. I did.

1353
01:04:25.567 --> 01:04:26.736
So what?

1354
01:04:26.805 --> 01:04:28.466
I didn't give a name.
Did I?

1355
01:04:31.708 --> 01:04:33.475
I'm pretty sure you did.

1356
01:04:33.544 --> 01:04:34.841
No. I didn't.

1357
01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:36.340
Okay. so whatever.

1358
01:04:36.409 --> 01:04:38.147
Hey. Michael.
what's the big deal?

1359
01:04:38.216 --> 01:04:39.576
Can anybody tell me
what's going on here?

1360
01:04:39.644 --> 01:04:41.281
No. nothing's going on.
Can we move on?

1361
01:04:41.350 --> 01:04:43.113
All right.
What are you guys talking about?

1362
01:04:43.182 --> 01:04:44.714
Who's Joanne? I'm lost.

1363
01:04:44.783 --> 01:04:47.022
You're always lost.
Can we just please move on?

1364
01:04:47.091 --> 01:04:48.419
All right.
can we continue?

1365
01:04:48.488 --> 01:04:50.620
-Yes. please.
-Okay.

1366
01:04:52.564 --> 01:04:54.428
So. who's Joanne?

1367
01:04:54.497 --> 01:04:56.295
Shut up.

1368
01:04:56.364 --> 01:04:58.127
Sunflower seeds.
watch your language.

1369
01:04:58.196 --> 01:04:59.767
Please stop talking.

1370
01:04:59.835 --> 01:05:01.101
We'll get back to it.

1371
01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:02.632
All right.
You know what?

1372
01:05:04.371 --> 01:05:08.473
Who here has heard
of Neil Simon?

1373
01:05:17.415 --> 01:05:19.117
He's an American playwright.

1374
01:05:19.186 --> 01:05:21.322
uh. Oscar and Tony nominated.

1375
01:05:21.391 --> 01:05:23.691
He wrote works
such as<i> Barefoot in the Park.</i>

1376
01:05:23.759 --> 01:05:25.122
<i>The Odd Couple.</i>

1377
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:27.690
He was born in the Bronx.

1378
01:05:27.758 --> 01:05:29.598
The Bronx.
That's what I was getting at.

1379
01:05:29.667 --> 01:05:30.967
Very good. Jessie.

1380
01:05:31.036 --> 01:05:33.899
Neil Simon wrote about
what he knew.

1381
01:05:33.968 --> 01:05:35.265
where he came from.

1382
01:05:35.334 --> 01:05:38.167
He brought himself to his art.

1383
01:05:38.235 --> 01:05:39.636
What a concept.

1384
01:05:41.246 --> 01:05:44.010
That's all I'm trying
to get you guys to do today.

1385
01:05:44.079 --> 01:05:45.477
It's actually really simple.

1386
01:05:45.546 --> 01:05:49.079
trying to let you know
that you are enough.

1387
01:05:49.148 --> 01:05:51.488
Just be who you are.

1388
01:05:51.556 --> 01:05:53.120
Be who you are?

1389
01:05:53.189 --> 01:05:55.424
That's not how
my father sees it.

1390
01:05:55.493 --> 01:05:56.552
Oh. okay.

1391
01:05:56.621 --> 01:05:59.561
Well. how does
your mother see it?

1392
01:05:59.629 --> 01:06:01.229
My mother?

1393
01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:05.035
Well...

1394
01:06:07.231 --> 01:06:09.138
she was sick too.

1395
01:06:10.369 --> 01:06:12.669
I knew it was serious but...

1396
01:06:15.106 --> 01:06:16.640
my father.

1397
01:06:19.013 --> 01:06:21.513
he just became this void.

1398
01:06:22.852 --> 01:06:25.283
Never talked to me.

1399
01:06:25.352 --> 01:06:29.151
He kind of just
walked around me.

1400
01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:31.626
Never told me.

1401
01:06:31.695 --> 01:06:33.327
He never just...

1402
01:06:36.867 --> 01:06:39.696
never just helped me once.

1403
01:06:45.477 --> 01:06:47.907
He just--

1404
01:06:47.976 --> 01:06:49.475
he pushed me away.

1405
01:06:51.850 --> 01:06:53.446
He pushed me away from her.

1406
01:06:56.688 --> 01:06:58.748
Never got to say goodbye.

1407
01:07:01.824 --> 01:07:03.627
And he just--

1408
01:07:03.695 --> 01:07:06.360
he just kept ignoring me.

1409
01:07:08.896 --> 01:07:10.496
She...

1410
01:07:12.570 --> 01:07:13.763
she died.

1411
01:07:20.142 --> 01:07:22.211
You ever talked
to him about it?

1412
01:07:23.408 --> 01:07:25.346
About a thousand times.

1413
01:07:26.383 --> 01:07:30.718
You know. it's kind of
like they both died.

1414
01:07:30.787 --> 01:07:33.022
I was only eight.

1415
01:07:33.091 --> 01:07:38.187
Now. I'm 17
and I'm with you guys.

1416
01:07:38.255 --> 01:07:40.427
But still.

1417
01:07:41.627 --> 01:07:46.235
after all this time.
I miss her.

1418
01:07:53.909 --> 01:07:55.310
She hears you.

1419
01:07:58.144 --> 01:08:00.482
You think so?

1420
01:08:00.551 --> 01:08:02.650
Why not?

1421
01:08:02.719 --> 01:08:04.148
I hope.

1422
01:08:04.217 --> 01:08:06.451
But. um. last Christmas.

1423
01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:09.521
he told me
I had my mother's eyes.

1424
01:08:09.590 --> 01:08:13.129
gave me a present.
and then he left.

1425
01:08:13.198 --> 01:08:17.364
And. you know.
no amount of money or presents.

1426
01:08:17.433 --> 01:08:21.263
none of that can fix
what's broken between us

1427
01:08:21.331 --> 01:08:22.766
because...

1428
01:08:24.907 --> 01:08:27.543
I'm invisible.

1429
01:08:27.612 --> 01:08:28.706
I am.

1430
01:08:31.378 --> 01:08:33.381
This is what I'm talking about.

1431
01:08:36.816 --> 01:08:39.084
Allie. thank you
for sharing that.

1432
01:08:39.152 --> 01:08:40.784
Sorry.

1433
01:08:42.092 --> 01:08:44.287
No. Don't be sorry.

1434
01:08:44.356 --> 01:08:45.689
Listen. this is not easy

1435
01:08:45.758 --> 01:08:48.292
what I'm asking you
to do today. guys.

1436
01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:49.926
But you're rocking it.

1437
01:08:49.995 --> 01:08:52.367
-Thank you.
-I'm really proud of you guys.

1438
01:08:54.067 --> 01:08:55.266
Okay.

1439
01:08:55.335 --> 01:08:58.541
There are two of you left.

1440
01:08:58.610 --> 01:09:00.235
Who's up?

1441
01:09:00.304 --> 01:09:02.304
Casey.

1442
01:09:02.373 --> 01:09:03.873
We all went.

1443
01:09:05.146 --> 01:09:06.543
What about Ms. Long.

1444
01:09:06.612 --> 01:09:08.449
-Oh.
-What about me?

1445
01:09:08.517 --> 01:09:09.945
You said
that you would tell us

1446
01:09:10.014 --> 01:09:11.082
what you went through
while sitting up here.

1447
01:09:11.151 --> 01:09:12.552
That's true.

1448
01:09:13.823 --> 01:09:15.158
Well?

1449
01:09:15.227 --> 01:09:18.256
Well.
you guys aren't done yet. so.

1450
01:09:18.324 --> 01:09:19.857
That sounds familiar.

1451
01:09:19.925 --> 01:09:22.130
-What are you worried about?
-Just be yourself.

1452
01:09:22.198 --> 01:09:23.529
Yeah. be honest with us.

1453
01:09:23.598 --> 01:09:24.993
Scared of a little confession?

1454
01:09:25.062 --> 01:09:26.699
I mean. you told us
to be ourselves. right?

1455
01:09:26.767 --> 01:09:28.135
-Who are you. Ms. Long?
-Just tell us.

1456
01:09:28.204 --> 01:09:31.271
Come on. Do it. Do it.

1457
01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:32.836
-You can do it.
-Tell us.

1458
01:09:32.904 --> 01:09:34.407
-Come on.
-Come on. Teach.

1459
01:09:34.475 --> 01:09:35.972
Give yourself to the character.
Emote.

1460
01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:37.910
Oh. my God.
The students become the teacher.

1461
01:09:37.979 --> 01:09:39.244
-Tell us. Tell us. Tell us.
-Come on. Come on.

1462
01:09:39.313 --> 01:09:40.642
Oh. yeah.

1463
01:09:40.711 --> 01:09:43.152
Okay. Okay. okay. Okay. Okay.

1464
01:09:43.221 --> 01:09:45.654
Whoo!
All right. Give me a minute.

1465
01:09:45.723 --> 01:09:47.116
It's. um.

1466
01:09:47.185 --> 01:09:49.952
it's been a while since anyone
asked me about my story.

1467
01:09:52.292 --> 01:09:53.758
All right. Well...

1468
01:09:55.528 --> 01:09:58.501
taking you back to 12 years old.

1469
01:09:59.470 --> 01:10:02.436
The teachers in school
started noticing things

1470
01:10:02.505 --> 01:10:06.038
like the way I was behaving
and. um...

1471
01:10:06.107 --> 01:10:08.674
and uh. bruises.

1472
01:10:11.650 --> 01:10:12.809
Um...

1473
01:10:12.878 --> 01:10:14.011
I can't believe you guys
are making me do this.

1474
01:10:17.748 --> 01:10:20.184
I'll never forget that day.

1475
01:10:20.253 --> 01:10:22.191
I was. uh...

1476
01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:23.656
in my favorite room
in the house.

1477
01:10:23.725 --> 01:10:26.462
It's the one
with the record player in it.

1478
01:10:26.531 --> 01:10:30.333
And I was playing
my favorite Billy Joel album.

1479
01:10:30.402 --> 01:10:32.366
Didn't even get to hear
the end of Vienna

1480
01:10:32.435 --> 01:10:36.564
and there was a knock
on the door.

1481
01:10:36.633 --> 01:10:39.001
and it was two men.

1482
01:10:40.812 --> 01:10:42.411
And my mom. uh...

1483
01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:46.913
casually said
for me to pack a bag.

1484
01:10:46.982 --> 01:10:48.384
Um...

1485
01:10:50.113 --> 01:10:52.519
And I got in the car
with these strangers

1486
01:10:52.588 --> 01:10:55.090
who took me to this place
that we had passed

1487
01:10:55.159 --> 01:10:56.857
a bunch of times in the car.

1488
01:10:56.926 --> 01:11:01.863
And I never knew what it was.
but it was a foster care home.

1489
01:11:01.932 --> 01:11:03.366
And. you know.

1490
01:11:03.435 --> 01:11:04.896
I thought it was just like
a temporary thing

1491
01:11:04.964 --> 01:11:07.467
so that my dad could get his act
together or whatever.

1492
01:11:07.536 --> 01:11:10.703
But time went on and on

1493
01:11:13.243 --> 01:11:14.773
and nobody came back for me.

1494
01:11:21.284 --> 01:11:24.150
Um. they just left me there.

1495
01:11:24.219 --> 01:11:25.520
Just left me there.

1496
01:11:28.889 --> 01:11:31.088
My dad. he had just.
you know. left for good

1497
01:11:31.157 --> 01:11:35.365
and my mom never recovered
from that. so that was that.

1498
01:11:39.603 --> 01:11:42.938
Foster parents.
awesome people.

1499
01:11:43.007 --> 01:11:45.233
Linda and Carl. so cool.

1500
01:11:45.302 --> 01:11:48.939
They took me to therapy.
and God they. tried everything.

1501
01:11:49.007 --> 01:11:51.174
I just didn't understand
what was wrong with me.

1502
01:11:51.243 --> 01:11:55.979
Like what made me so unlovable
that they left me there.

1503
01:11:57.348 --> 01:11:59.983
and a really great doctor
suggested that I just needed

1504
01:12:00.051 --> 01:12:02.454
a safe space to. like.
work through my feelings.

1505
01:12:02.523 --> 01:12:06.491
And that safe space was theater.

1506
01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:07.824
And that's when I fell in love

1507
01:12:07.893 --> 01:12:10.499
with expressing myself
through art.

1508
01:12:12.068 --> 01:12:13.434
So I went for it

1509
01:12:13.503 --> 01:12:15.604
and I got accepted
to this. like.

1510
01:12:15.673 --> 01:12:19.904
topnotch conservatory
and ran around New York City

1511
01:12:19.972 --> 01:12:22.407
with a headshot
and auditioned a bunch.

1512
01:12:22.476 --> 01:12:24.513
and I did some theater.

1513
01:12:24.582 --> 01:12:27.609
But I felt like
I had a different calling.

1514
01:12:27.678 --> 01:12:29.145
And that was this.

1515
01:12:29.213 --> 01:12:31.580
It was connecting
with young people like you.

1516
01:12:31.649 --> 01:12:33.015
because I've been there.

1517
01:12:33.084 --> 01:12:36.987
and I just want you guys
to be your best. okay?

1518
01:12:38.088 --> 01:12:42.196
My calling is to give you
that safe space

1519
01:12:42.265 --> 01:12:44.496
to work your stuff out.

1520
01:12:44.565 --> 01:12:45.930
What happened to them?

1521
01:12:47.371 --> 01:12:49.670
-To who?
-Your parents.

1522
01:12:51.473 --> 01:12:54.202
Well. I never saw my dad again.

1523
01:12:54.271 --> 01:12:58.712
And I found out he passed
of a stroke 10 years ago.

1524
01:13:00.482 --> 01:13:01.913
What about your mother?

1525
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:06.087
She's still alive.

1526
01:13:06.156 --> 01:13:07.888
Have you seen her?

1527
01:13:07.957 --> 01:13:09.417
No.

1528
01:13:09.486 --> 01:13:11.557
Why not?

1529
01:13:11.626 --> 01:13:13.793
-I don't know.
-Yes. you do.

1530
01:13:16.696 --> 01:13:20.903
-Yeah. I do.
-I don't get it.

1531
01:13:20.972 --> 01:13:23.300
Rejection...

1532
01:13:23.369 --> 01:13:24.471
right?

1533
01:13:24.539 --> 01:13:25.970
It's hard enough
the first time.

1534
01:13:26.039 --> 01:13:29.110
What if she didn't
wanna see me again. right?

1535
01:13:29.179 --> 01:13:30.744
You should still go.

1536
01:13:30.812 --> 01:13:32.844
Yeah.
but she never came back for me.

1537
01:13:32.913 --> 01:13:35.712
Don't go for her.
go for you.

1538
01:13:35.781 --> 01:13:37.146
Show her what you've become.

1539
01:13:37.214 --> 01:13:38.983
Yeah.
she couldn't break you.

1540
01:13:41.325 --> 01:13:42.954
They have no idea. do they?

1541
01:13:45.123 --> 01:13:47.860
The mess they leave
when they do that.

1542
01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:55.632
You're here.
that means something.

1543
01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:57.100
I think you should go.

1544
01:13:57.169 --> 01:14:00.373
You never know
how much time you have left.

1545
01:14:00.441 --> 01:14:02.644
Well. guys

1546
01:14:02.713 --> 01:14:04.980
you've given me
some stuff to think about.

1547
01:14:05.048 --> 01:14:06.208
Thank you.

1548
01:14:10.054 --> 01:14:11.179
Okay. All right.

1549
01:14:11.248 --> 01:14:13.754
This isn't about me.
This is about you.

1550
01:14:13.822 --> 01:14:16.753
Jason. please take me
off the hot seat.

1551
01:14:16.822 --> 01:14:18.891
-What you got?
-What?

1552
01:14:23.635 --> 01:14:26.894
Am I supposed to get up there
and cry some?

1553
01:14:26.963 --> 01:14:28.764
Yeah. something like that.

1554
01:14:28.833 --> 01:14:31.871
I did. So did Ms. Long.

1555
01:14:34.609 --> 01:14:37.342
-I'll go.
-Casey.

1556
01:14:37.410 --> 01:14:38.878
All right.

1557
01:14:42.216 --> 01:14:43.619
Hold on.

1558
01:14:44.714 --> 01:14:45.951
I'm sorry.

1559
01:14:46.916 --> 01:14:48.558
What are you sorry about?

1560
01:14:51.929 --> 01:14:52.958
Michael.

1561
01:14:54.527 --> 01:14:56.093
Understand...

1562
01:14:58.166 --> 01:15:02.432
what happened was no more
your fault than it was mine.

1563
01:15:02.501 --> 01:15:04.173
What?

1564
01:15:04.241 --> 01:15:06.708
About a year ago.

1565
01:15:08.442 --> 01:15:09.674
I believed him.

1566
01:15:09.743 --> 01:15:11.174
just like you believed her.

1567
01:15:12.243 --> 01:15:17.014
And the result of that
tore me apart.

1568
01:15:17.083 --> 01:15:22.224
I hated everyone.
especially myself.

1569
01:15:22.292 --> 01:15:24.253
I couldn't eat for weeks.

1570
01:15:24.322 --> 01:15:27.190
I asked myself
if I made the right decision.

1571
01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:32.834
Did I make the right decision?

1572
01:15:34.004 --> 01:15:38.703
And that's another thing.
is there really such a thing

1573
01:15:38.772 --> 01:15:42.176
as like the right decision?

1574
01:15:42.245 --> 01:15:43.338
Or is it just...

1575
01:15:45.111 --> 01:15:48.011
you know.
the moment you're living in

1576
01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:51.753
and trying to figure out
how to live it?

1577
01:15:54.319 --> 01:15:57.660
If I would've--
if I would've had my baby.

1578
01:15:59.892 --> 01:16:01.423
Sorry. I'm sorry. I don't--

1579
01:16:01.492 --> 01:16:06.867
I don't know why I'm
talking to you all about this.

1580
01:16:08.469 --> 01:16:10.134
I'm sorry. Casey.

1581
01:16:11.237 --> 01:16:16.706
-Why are you sorry?
-No. I mean. I understand.

1582
01:16:16.774 --> 01:16:18.076
You understand?

1583
01:16:20.345 --> 01:16:22.747
If you put you in my position
for a minute.

1584
01:16:22.816 --> 01:16:25.049
somebody like you gets pregnant

1585
01:16:25.118 --> 01:16:29.158
and then people say.
"Oh. poor girl.

1586
01:16:29.227 --> 01:16:30.893
I hope she's okay.

1587
01:16:30.961 --> 01:16:36.024
"Somebody like me gets pregnant
and. "Oh. yeah. it figures.

1588
01:16:36.093 --> 01:16:39.167
We all saw that coming. right?"

1589
01:16:39.236 --> 01:16:41.836
Hell do you know.

1590
01:16:41.904 --> 01:16:45.772
You're right. okay?
I'm-- you're right.

1591
01:16:45.841 --> 01:16:49.038
Casey.
nobody's gonna judge you

1592
01:16:49.106 --> 01:16:50.613
or you. Michael.
for that matter.

1593
01:16:50.682 --> 01:16:52.109
for the choices
you've had to make.

1594
01:16:52.178 --> 01:16:55.276
these. like.
really grown up decisions.

1595
01:16:55.345 --> 01:16:57.445
Ms. Long.
I know you're not blind.

1596
01:16:57.514 --> 01:17:00.486
I'm looked at different
and you know that.

1597
01:17:00.555 --> 01:17:02.054
She's right...

1598
01:17:03.624 --> 01:17:05.391
even in this school.

1599
01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:07.161
Listen.

1600
01:17:07.230 --> 01:17:11.732
Life is learned along the way
and we're all figuring it out.

1601
01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:13.901
Really. no judgment here.
right. guys?

1602
01:17:15.304 --> 01:17:16.564
Not today.

1603
01:17:17.467 --> 01:17:19.439
Did you talk to your parents?

1604
01:17:19.508 --> 01:17:21.370
Your dad. someone?

1605
01:17:23.107 --> 01:17:27.045
My dad is-- I can't talk to him.

1606
01:17:27.114 --> 01:17:30.016
I mean. and my mom
is either in denial

1607
01:17:30.084 --> 01:17:33.723
or praying I don't find
my way back there again.

1608
01:17:39.698 --> 01:17:42.094
-I disappointed you.
-Your point is?

1609
01:17:43.763 --> 01:17:45.262
It's what you meant.

1610
01:17:52.474 --> 01:17:54.104
Ms. Long?

1611
01:17:54.173 --> 01:17:57.176
Let's have a discussion outside.
please.

1612
01:17:57.245 --> 01:17:59.643
Great job. everybody.
Just please meet me outside.

1613
01:17:59.712 --> 01:18:01.045
All right. guys.

1614
01:18:01.114 --> 01:18:02.818
I guess we're taking
another break.

1615
01:18:03.785 --> 01:18:05.920
Just take a breath. It's okay.

1616
01:18:08.859 --> 01:18:11.059
-Where are we going?
-Where we can't be heard.

1617
01:18:11.128 --> 01:18:14.355
Okay. You gotta be kidding me!
Okay. We got daddy issues.

1618
01:18:14.424 --> 01:18:15.994
One kid wants to come out
of the closet.

1619
01:18:16.063 --> 01:18:17.729
One kid wants to blow up
the whole world.

1620
01:18:17.797 --> 01:18:19.062
Then we got abortions.

1621
01:18:19.131 --> 01:18:20.628
Then you open up
with child abuse?

1622
01:18:20.697 --> 01:18:21.832
-Stop it! Stop it!
-No. you're done! You're done!

1623
01:18:21.901 --> 01:18:23.434
Okay. Don't you get it?

1624
01:18:23.502 --> 01:18:25.240
They need to know that
I went through the same thing.

1625
01:18:25.309 --> 01:18:26.501
But what was it?

1626
01:18:26.570 --> 01:18:27.873
What you did in there
is unorthodox. okay?

1627
01:18:27.941 --> 01:18:29.511
-They are kids!
-Yeah. they are.

1628
01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:31.211
Talking through their problems.

1629
01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:32.977
and we're just telling them
it's okay to feel that way.

1630
01:18:33.046 --> 01:18:35.513
No. no. no. Not me. You.
So save it.

1631
01:18:35.582 --> 01:18:38.381
Who's gonna clean up this mess
when these kids go home today?

1632
01:18:38.450 --> 01:18:40.118
There's peace on the other side
of this for them.

1633
01:18:40.187 --> 01:18:41.585
don't you get it?
I know you see it.

1634
01:18:41.654 --> 01:18:43.223
Peace?

1635
01:18:43.291 --> 01:18:45.161
Are you kidding me? It's called
the unemployment line. okay?

1636
01:18:45.229 --> 01:18:46.355
So stupid.

1637
01:18:46.424 --> 01:18:47.661
What's gonna happen
when their parents

1638
01:18:47.730 --> 01:18:48.994
start calling me on Monday?

1639
01:18:49.063 --> 01:18:50.426
Look. you just need
to calm down!

1640
01:18:50.494 --> 01:18:52.298
No. but you opened
up this can of worms.

1641
01:18:52.367 --> 01:18:54.329
I opened up a safe space. okay?
That's what I am giving them.

1642
01:18:54.398 --> 01:18:57.303
A safe space?
Are you kidding me?

1643
01:18:57.372 --> 01:19:00.270
Listen. stop being their friend
and just be their damn teacher.

1644
01:19:00.339 --> 01:19:02.108
Hey. why don't you start
being their friend?

1645
01:19:02.177 --> 01:19:05.410
And maybe then you can be
a great teacher. you ass.

1646
01:19:05.478 --> 01:19:09.081
-Oh. my God. This is a school.
-Oh. that's brilliant.

1647
01:19:09.150 --> 01:19:10.712
Okay. Listen.
you wanna put a Band-Aid on it?

1648
01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:12.615
But when all the parents
start calling me on Monday.

1649
01:19:12.684 --> 01:19:15.283
guess what. I'm gonna give
your cell phone number. okay?

1650
01:19:15.352 --> 01:19:18.293
Joan of Arc.
Mother Teresa over here.

1651
01:19:18.362 --> 01:19:19.525
Unbelievable.

1652
01:19:39.349 --> 01:19:40.443
Casey?

1653
01:19:43.119 --> 01:19:47.288
About what you said earlier.
you were right.

1654
01:19:47.357 --> 01:19:48.484
Yeah?

1655
01:19:50.525 --> 01:19:51.586
Think so?

1656
01:19:52.793 --> 01:19:54.761
-I do.
-Me too.

1657
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:57.629
We're all looked at differently.

1658
01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:00.166
Is something funny?

1659
01:20:01.436 --> 01:20:05.838
-Right. What about you then?
-I think you guys are right.

1660
01:20:05.907 --> 01:20:08.536
I don't think it's your fault.

1661
01:20:08.605 --> 01:20:10.578
I don't
think it's anybody's fault.

1662
01:20:10.646 --> 01:20:11.946
You know what I mean.

1663
01:20:12.015 --> 01:20:13.343
Yeah.
I know what you mean.

1664
01:20:13.412 --> 01:20:14.917
But what I said.
and you said nothing.

1665
01:20:16.414 --> 01:20:19.049
Guys.
wanna change the subject?

1666
01:20:19.118 --> 01:20:22.820
Sure. Let's change the subject.

1667
01:20:22.889 --> 01:20:23.922
What about Ms. Long?

1668
01:20:23.991 --> 01:20:27.325
That was cool. what she did.

1669
01:20:28.626 --> 01:20:31.295
-I don't think she'd do it.
-Yeah. me neither.

1670
01:20:31.364 --> 01:20:32.933
You guys think she's lying?

1671
01:20:33.002 --> 01:20:33.931
-Are you serious?
-What? No way.

1672
01:20:33.999 --> 01:20:37.066
No. I don't think so.

1673
01:20:37.135 --> 01:20:39.441
Why are you staring at me?

1674
01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:40.635
I'm staring at him.

1675
01:20:44.043 --> 01:20:45.547
Anything you wanna say?

1676
01:20:45.615 --> 01:20:47.748
You never answered me.

1677
01:20:47.817 --> 01:20:49.081
-About?
-Let it go.

1678
01:20:49.150 --> 01:20:50.379
Now. you knew Joanne.
didn't you?

1679
01:20:50.448 --> 01:20:52.186
Wait. We're back to this again?

1680
01:20:52.255 --> 01:20:53.384
Wait. can you tell me
who Joanne is. please?

1681
01:20:55.385 --> 01:20:56.892
-It's bullshit.
-No. wait.

1682
01:20:56.961 --> 01:20:58.289
Is she someone
you both knew or what?

1683
01:20:58.358 --> 01:20:59.629
-What. you're Mr. Helper now?
-Maybe.

1684
01:20:59.697 --> 01:21:01.262
Guys. I don't like this.

1685
01:21:01.331 --> 01:21:02.723
I don't wanna fucking hear it.
You're gonna answer me.

1686
01:21:02.792 --> 01:21:04.093
-I think you know. huh?
-Know what?

1687
01:21:04.162 --> 01:21:05.461
-Jason.
-Wait. Know what?

1688
01:21:05.530 --> 01:21:07.496
-Max. leave it alone.
-Oh. hold on.

1689
01:21:07.565 --> 01:21:10.037
No. no. no.
I wanna hear this.

1690
01:21:10.106 --> 01:21:11.938
-You figured it out?
-Figure out what?

1691
01:21:12.007 --> 01:21:14.139
-Guys. guys. let's stop.
-Fuck off.

1692
01:21:14.208 --> 01:21:17.009
Right? You wanna know?
Yeah. Sure.

1693
01:21:17.077 --> 01:21:19.243
-I knew Joanne.
-Jason.

1694
01:21:19.312 --> 01:21:20.608
Why didn't you just
say that then?

1695
01:21:20.677 --> 01:21:21.844
Yeah. I think
I can figure that out.

1696
01:21:21.913 --> 01:21:23.210
No way.

1697
01:21:23.279 --> 01:21:25.216
Wait. you knew her?

1698
01:21:25.285 --> 01:21:27.789
-Fuck off!
-Hey. leave her alone.

1699
01:21:27.858 --> 01:21:30.758
Fuck her.
I wanna hear it from you.

1700
01:21:30.827 --> 01:21:32.358
Jason. what is he talking about?

1701
01:21:32.427 --> 01:21:34.128
All right. now. Now. you guys
are all judging me?

1702
01:21:34.196 --> 01:21:36.229
Michael. listen to me.
He's not worth it.

1703
01:21:36.298 --> 01:21:38.660
-Don't do this.
-No. let's do this now. huh?

1704
01:21:38.729 --> 01:21:40.565
Okay. You can't hold
your own fucking shit.

1705
01:21:40.634 --> 01:21:42.135
-Hold on to my shit?
-I don't know why the hell

1706
01:21:42.204 --> 01:21:43.698
you're in this fucking school.
okay?

1707
01:21:43.766 --> 01:21:45.503
-You should be traveling.
-Hey. stop it!

1708
01:21:45.572 --> 01:21:46.807
Doing something and-- yeah.
Oh. yeah. rich bitch.

1709
01:21:46.876 --> 01:21:48.174
Oh. your bitch fucking problems.

1710
01:21:48.243 --> 01:21:49.137
-Fuck you!
-Daddy can't buy me a car.

1711
01:21:49.206 --> 01:21:50.606
Hold on to my shit?

1712
01:21:50.675 --> 01:21:52.345
Yeah. Hold on
to your fucking shit. okay?

1713
01:21:52.413 --> 01:21:54.347
Four hours ago. we came in here
as fucking strangers.

1714
01:21:54.416 --> 01:21:56.585
then we're gonna step
out of here in three hours

1715
01:21:56.653 --> 01:21:57.886
as fucking strangers.

1716
01:21:57.954 --> 01:21:59.648
You watched me
crash and burn up there.

1717
01:21:59.716 --> 01:22:01.353
-Stop! Stop!
-I don't give a shit. okay?

1718
01:22:01.422 --> 01:22:03.359
It's your own fucking life.
Deal with it.

1719
01:22:03.428 --> 01:22:04.719
No! Shut up!

1720
01:22:04.787 --> 01:22:06.424
I don't have to listen
to this fucking bullshit.

1721
01:22:06.493 --> 01:22:07.996
-You should!
-And if I did?

1722
01:22:08.065 --> 01:22:10.930
-If I did? So what?
-No! You just sat there.

1723
01:22:10.999 --> 01:22:12.727
She almost died 'cause of you!

1724
01:22:17.575 --> 01:22:18.634
It wasn't my fault.

1725
01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:23.012
Wasn't your fault?

1726
01:22:25.983 --> 01:22:27.714
Why don't you mess
with somebody else. huh?

1727
01:22:27.783 --> 01:22:29.049
You're disgusting.

1728
01:22:29.118 --> 01:22:30.447
Stop fucking
looking at me. okay?

1729
01:22:30.516 --> 01:22:32.886
She left because of you.
You fucking asshole.

1730
01:22:32.955 --> 01:22:35.088
You scared her the fuck away.

1731
01:22:35.157 --> 01:22:36.586
-Hey!
-Oh. my God.

1732
01:22:36.655 --> 01:22:38.054
-Stop. Jason.
-Yo. watch it. bro. Watch it.

1733
01:22:41.058 --> 01:22:42.731
Stop!

1734
01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:44.296
No. Yo. Bring it down.

1735
01:22:44.365 --> 01:22:45.831
Sit down.
Will you sit down?

1736
01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:47.267
Get off me.

1737
01:22:47.335 --> 01:22:48.966
Fuck you. you fucking bitch.
Fucking die.

1738
01:22:49.035 --> 01:22:50.940
Come at me.

1739
01:22:51.009 --> 01:22:52.567
Yo. Faulk comes in.
we're all done.

1740
01:22:52.636 --> 01:22:53.905
Well.
you wanna blame me. okay?

1741
01:22:53.974 --> 01:22:55.274
No wonder she fucking...

1742
01:22:55.343 --> 01:22:57.712
-Go ahead and say it. asshole.
-Stop.

1743
01:22:57.781 --> 01:22:59.814
So today was all a lie.

1744
01:22:59.883 --> 01:23:01.012
No. you don't understand. huh?

1745
01:23:01.081 --> 01:23:02.546
Jason. you're bleeding.

1746
01:23:04.281 --> 01:23:05.681
Did you really tell her?

1747
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:08.024
-You blame her?
-I didn't know what to do.

1748
01:23:08.092 --> 01:23:09.952
So you just walked away
and did nothing?

1749
01:23:10.021 --> 01:23:11.787
-Where the fuck were you. huh?
-You guys just stop.

1750
01:23:11.855 --> 01:23:13.425
-No. man. don't.
-Where the fuck were...

1751
01:23:13.493 --> 01:23:16.359
-Michael!
-Calm down! Watch it!

1752
01:23:16.428 --> 01:23:18.463
-Feel better now?
-Jason.

1753
01:23:19.796 --> 01:23:21.730
I gotta fucking
live with it. okay?

1754
01:23:23.771 --> 01:23:24.905
Casey?

1755
01:23:24.974 --> 01:23:26.603
I have nothing to say to you.

1756
01:23:26.672 --> 01:23:29.610
I'm sorry. just--
it's just not the way you think.

1757
01:23:31.877 --> 01:23:33.476
Hey.

1758
01:23:33.545 --> 01:23:35.150
What the hell
is going on in here?

1759
01:23:35.218 --> 01:23:36.846
What have you guys
been doing?

1760
01:23:36.915 --> 01:23:38.952
Look at the mess in this place.
What the hell is going on. guys?

1761
01:23:39.021 --> 01:23:41.257
Max. Allie. I wanna know. Now!

1762
01:23:41.325 --> 01:23:43.023
We're just rehearsing. you know.
getting real in the moment.

1763
01:23:43.091 --> 01:23:45.820
Stop it. okay?
What is going on?

1764
01:23:45.889 --> 01:23:48.995
Look at his face.
What'd I tell you?

1765
01:23:49.064 --> 01:23:50.695
I told you so. Look at his face.

1766
01:23:50.764 --> 01:23:52.532
-"I told you so? "
-Yeah. Look at this.

1767
01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:54.795
It's exactly what Max said.
like we were told to do.

1768
01:23:54.864 --> 01:23:56.564
You expect us to believe that?
Come on.

1769
01:23:56.633 --> 01:23:58.306
Yes. okay?
We were just rehearsing.

1770
01:23:58.374 --> 01:23:59.534
-What do you want us to say?
-Just rehearsing.

1771
01:23:59.603 --> 01:24:01.342
-What? With fists?
-Yes. Yes.

1772
01:24:01.411 --> 01:24:02.704
Looks like he got one
over on you. tough guy. huh?

1773
01:24:02.773 --> 01:24:04.277
No. it's just
my part of the scene.

1774
01:24:04.346 --> 01:24:05.473
Look at that. huh?
Nice face.

1775
01:24:05.542 --> 01:24:07.347
What do you think. I'm stupid?

1776
01:24:07.416 --> 01:24:09.249
I mean. I wouldn't
underestimate you. sir.

1777
01:24:09.318 --> 01:24:10.646
-But if...
-All right. Jason. Enough.

1778
01:24:10.715 --> 01:24:12.580
That's not funny.
Okay. you're hurt.

1779
01:24:12.649 --> 01:24:15.123
Nah. Ms. Miranda.
just baby taps.

1780
01:24:15.192 --> 01:24:16.286
Baby taps?
Okay. I'm listening.

1781
01:24:16.355 --> 01:24:17.726
Who started this fight. guys?

1782
01:24:17.794 --> 01:24:19.690
Jason? Come on.

1783
01:24:19.758 --> 01:24:22.026
I don't know what to say. okay?
Maybe let's ask Mikey.

1784
01:24:22.095 --> 01:24:23.864
I'm listening.

1785
01:24:23.933 --> 01:24:26.427
I'm listening! Come on!

1786
01:24:26.496 --> 01:24:27.795
Oh. you know what?

1787
01:24:27.864 --> 01:24:29.368
I think I could piece
this together.

1788
01:24:29.437 --> 01:24:30.539
-Really?
-I could piece this together.

1789
01:24:30.608 --> 01:24:31.700
Like I said. sir.

1790
01:24:31.769 --> 01:24:33.006
Things happen. you know?
Just like you said.

1791
01:24:33.075 --> 01:24:34.473
Oh. things happen. huh?

1792
01:24:34.542 --> 01:24:36.245
So you're willing to go down
with this guy

1793
01:24:36.314 --> 01:24:37.774
just because you two
don't wanna tell the truth?

1794
01:24:37.843 --> 01:24:39.512
You forgot to throw in this
with summer school.

1795
01:24:39.581 --> 01:24:40.749
Oh. no. Summer school's coming.
don't worry about that.

1796
01:24:40.818 --> 01:24:42.251
I'll take care of that.

1797
01:24:42.319 --> 01:24:43.380
You should be worried
about your scholarship.

1798
01:24:43.448 --> 01:24:44.846
-He fell.
-Oh. he fell?

1799
01:24:44.915 --> 01:24:46.181
With the strawberries
on his face. he fell?

1800
01:24:46.249 --> 01:24:47.517
Yes.

1801
01:24:47.586 --> 01:24:49.158
You guys are kidding me
with this.

1802
01:24:49.226 --> 01:24:50.086
-Look at his face.

1803
01:24:50.155 --> 01:24:51.292
Jessie?

1804
01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:53.888
Don't.

1805
01:24:58.494 --> 01:25:01.466
-He fell.
-He fell.

1806
01:25:01.535 --> 01:25:03.165
Oh. you guys belong
in drama class.

1807
01:25:03.234 --> 01:25:04.833
Oh. shit.

1808
01:25:07.608 --> 01:25:09.641
Okay. And this fell out
of your backpack. huh?

1809
01:25:09.710 --> 01:25:11.747
-What is it?
-Don't play that game with me.

1810
01:25:11.816 --> 01:25:13.013
No. I didn't mean that.

1811
01:25:13.082 --> 01:25:14.412
I know what it is. I just--

1812
01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:16.044
I don't know
what it's doing in there.

1813
01:25:16.112 --> 01:25:17.478
Okay. so perhaps
a phone call to your father

1814
01:25:17.547 --> 01:25:18.946
will help jog your memory.

1815
01:25:19.015 --> 01:25:20.451
-Would that help you?
-No. please.

1816
01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:21.883
-Don't call him. really.
-But...

1817
01:25:21.951 --> 01:25:23.355
Maybe I took
the wrong backpack.

1818
01:25:23.423 --> 01:25:25.160
-What?
-Or maybe someone slipped it in

1819
01:25:25.229 --> 01:25:26.824
while I was on the bus
this morning.

1820
01:25:26.893 --> 01:25:28.226
Oh. on the bus?
Do you even know what that is?

1821
01:25:28.295 --> 01:25:29.625
Phil. she said she doesn't know.

1822
01:25:29.694 --> 01:25:31.098
It's not in your hands now.
okay?

1823
01:25:31.167 --> 01:25:32.399
-It's mine.
-What?

1824
01:25:34.267 --> 01:25:36.937
Like I said. it's mine.

1825
01:25:37.005 --> 01:25:38.200
I bought it this morning.

1826
01:25:38.269 --> 01:25:39.505
Huh.

1827
01:25:40.370 --> 01:25:41.736
What store?

1828
01:25:41.805 --> 01:25:43.706
I brought it this morning
from my house.

1829
01:25:43.775 --> 01:25:45.278
You bought it.
you brought it.

1830
01:25:45.347 --> 01:25:47.949
Okay. So what's it doing
in her backpack?

1831
01:25:48.018 --> 01:25:49.779
-I hid it there.
-You hid it?

1832
01:25:49.848 --> 01:25:51.983
-Yes. I hid it there.
-That's right.

1833
01:25:52.052 --> 01:25:53.453
He hid it there.

1834
01:25:53.521 --> 01:25:54.850
So that's what you guys
are all telling me then?

1835
01:25:56.157 --> 01:25:58.153
Okay. he hid it?

1836
01:25:58.222 --> 01:25:59.895
Jason?

1837
01:25:59.964 --> 01:26:01.824
Yeah. and Allie had no idea.

1838
01:26:01.892 --> 01:26:03.161
All right.
This is all bullshit.

1839
01:26:03.229 --> 01:26:04.696
Why would you do that?

1840
01:26:04.764 --> 01:26:06.334
I'll ask all the questions here.
Why would you do that?

1841
01:26:06.402 --> 01:26:08.029
Because when Casey
and I were practicing.

1842
01:26:08.098 --> 01:26:10.939
Casey asked Allie if she
could borrow her backpack.

1843
01:26:11.008 --> 01:26:13.475
For like a prop or whatever.

1844
01:26:13.544 --> 01:26:15.342
I just slipped it in and Casey
had no idea. all right?

1845
01:26:15.411 --> 01:26:16.639
I've just been sipping
on it all day.

1846
01:26:16.707 --> 01:26:19.207
-Huh.
-I borrowed it.

1847
01:26:19.276 --> 01:26:20.978
Really?

1848
01:26:21.047 --> 01:26:22.310
Well. I don't know what games
you think you're playing here.

1849
01:26:22.379 --> 01:26:23.846
No games. sir.

1850
01:26:23.914 --> 01:26:27.518
So Jason.
this is your story?

1851
01:26:27.587 --> 01:26:29.951
Yes. it is.
If you don't mind...

1852
01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:31.755
No. no. no. listen.
you're coming with me.

1853
01:26:31.823 --> 01:26:33.790
Okay. everybody.
say goodbye to Mr. Personality.

1854
01:26:33.858 --> 01:26:35.293
He's gonna be leaving
for the day. okay?

1855
01:26:35.362 --> 01:26:36.491
Lead the way. Mr. Faulk.

1856
01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:38.059
Grab your shoes. Let's go.

1857
01:26:38.128 --> 01:26:39.563
-Come on. let's go.
-All right. guys.

1858
01:26:39.632 --> 01:26:40.901
Good luck.
you're gonna need luck.

1859
01:26:40.970 --> 01:26:42.665
Be back in a little bit.

1860
01:26:42.734 --> 01:26:44.071
What the fuck was that?

1861
01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:45.438
I was trying to cover...

1862
01:26:45.507 --> 01:26:46.601
Now. why the hell
would you do that?

1863
01:26:46.670 --> 01:26:48.510
I did it for you. okay?

1864
01:26:48.579 --> 01:26:49.470
Why did you even bring it
to school in the first place?

1865
01:26:51.214 --> 01:26:53.882
We all...
You understand that?

1866
01:26:53.951 --> 01:26:55.146
I didn't. okay?

1867
01:26:56.248 --> 01:26:57.550
Yeah. Mr. Walker.

1868
01:26:59.384 --> 01:27:01.086
Yeah. he's here now.

1869
01:27:01.155 --> 01:27:02.390
Yeah. a little incident.

1870
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:05.992
You can come
pick him up anytime.

1871
01:27:06.061 --> 01:27:07.622
We'll see you soon then.

1872
01:27:07.691 --> 01:27:09.365
Fuck him. he had it coming.

1873
01:27:09.433 --> 01:27:10.727
Listen.
I'm just as pissed off as you.

1874
01:27:10.796 --> 01:27:13.399
-Look what he did to me.
-Get off that. okay?

1875
01:27:13.468 --> 01:27:16.798
Did we learn anything.
you and I?

1876
01:27:16.867 --> 01:27:18.505
-What?
-Casey's right. man.

1877
01:27:20.239 --> 01:27:22.409
Maybe he's sorry.

1878
01:27:22.478 --> 01:27:24.038
I mean. he did take
the hit for you.

1879
01:27:26.109 --> 01:27:27.609
What do you think
is gonna happen to him?

1880
01:27:27.678 --> 01:27:29.110
I don't know. I don't know.

1881
01:27:29.178 --> 01:27:30.978
He could get thrown out
for what you just did.

1882
01:27:31.047 --> 01:27:32.785
You really gotta own
some of this. bro.

1883
01:27:32.854 --> 01:27:34.248
Shut up!

1884
01:27:34.317 --> 01:27:35.517
Blaming him really lets you
off the hook. doesn't it?

1885
01:27:35.586 --> 01:27:37.588
Okay. just leave me alone!

1886
01:27:37.656 --> 01:27:39.891
Michael. it's okay.
It's okay.

1887
01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:42.362
I know what you're feeling
but we are not our parents.

1888
01:27:42.431 --> 01:27:44.692
-He could've--
-He could've what?

1889
01:27:44.761 --> 01:27:46.232
He'd have. what. drove her?

1890
01:27:46.301 --> 01:27:47.696
He could've gave her money?

1891
01:27:47.765 --> 01:27:49.771
-Then what?
-Just stop it!

1892
01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:51.032
Michael.

1893
01:27:51.101 --> 01:27:53.941
You can't control
what people do. what Joanne did.

1894
01:27:54.009 --> 01:27:57.011
Allie is right.

1895
01:27:57.079 --> 01:27:59.077
Nothing would've changed.

1896
01:27:59.146 --> 01:28:01.114
I know that.

1897
01:28:01.183 --> 01:28:03.149
It still fucking hurts.

1898
01:28:03.217 --> 01:28:06.321
We know. We're sorry.

1899
01:28:06.390 --> 01:28:08.522
Michael. you didn't know
what she was gonna do.

1900
01:28:10.226 --> 01:28:12.959
We're kids. we're just kids.

1901
01:28:13.028 --> 01:28:14.055
What do we know?

1902
01:28:15.492 --> 01:28:17.160
He's right.

1903
01:28:17.229 --> 01:28:18.466
Jason?

1904
01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:22.404
-Yeah.
-About what?

1905
01:28:23.401 --> 01:28:25.238
About everything.

1906
01:28:25.307 --> 01:28:27.469
You know. my fucked up attitude.

1907
01:28:27.538 --> 01:28:29.010
It's okay.

1908
01:28:29.078 --> 01:28:30.676
It's okay. we got you.

1909
01:28:32.511 --> 01:28:34.444
I don't understand.

1910
01:28:34.512 --> 01:28:36.881
You know what?

1911
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:41.456
I really wish I had
someone like you a year ago.

1912
01:29:00.273 --> 01:29:02.006
So...

1913
01:29:02.075 --> 01:29:05.546
anyone here think Ms. Long
and Mr. Faulk are hooking up?

1914
01:29:05.614 --> 01:29:08.280
I mean.
they leave to go in the hallway.

1915
01:29:08.349 --> 01:29:10.180
like. all the time. right?

1916
01:29:10.249 --> 01:29:11.486
Like...

1917
01:29:47.351 --> 01:29:48.385
Hey!

1918
01:29:49.221 --> 01:29:51.221
-What the hell are you doing?
-Walking it off.

1919
01:29:51.290 --> 01:29:54.124
You bring alcohol to school?
Are you an idiot or something?

1920
01:29:54.193 --> 01:29:55.497
Hey!

1921
01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:59.164
Hey. what the fuck
is going on here?

1922
01:29:59.233 --> 01:30:00.469
Here we go.

1923
01:30:02.566 --> 01:30:04.402
And for you.

1924
01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:05.767
What do we do with these?

1925
01:30:05.836 --> 01:30:07.971
You are going to write in them.

1926
01:30:10.145 --> 01:30:11.246
Write what?

1927
01:30:11.314 --> 01:30:12.345
Y'all still need
a grade. right?

1928
01:30:12.414 --> 01:30:14.079
-Yes.
-Yes.

1929
01:30:14.148 --> 01:30:17.848
Then you are going to write
about your experiences today.

1930
01:30:17.917 --> 01:30:20.988
how each of you
affected one another.

1931
01:30:21.056 --> 01:30:22.619
That's it.

1932
01:30:22.688 --> 01:30:24.489
-That's it?
-Yeah.

1933
01:30:24.558 --> 01:30:25.820
You're gonna write about today.

1934
01:30:25.889 --> 01:30:29.123
And how you see yourselves now.

1935
01:30:29.192 --> 01:30:31.699
-Um...
-Not so hard. is it?

1936
01:30:31.767 --> 01:30:33.199
The only time
that I get a reaction out of you

1937
01:30:33.268 --> 01:30:34.768
is when I fuck up.

1938
01:30:34.837 --> 01:30:35.963
Oh. you're just dying
for a reason to get booted

1939
01:30:36.032 --> 01:30:37.605
-out of school. huh?
-Huh.

1940
01:30:37.673 --> 01:30:39.407
And what the hell
happened to your face?

1941
01:30:39.476 --> 01:30:41.109
Would you believe me
if I told you?

1942
01:30:41.177 --> 01:30:42.974
What about the scene?

1943
01:30:43.043 --> 01:30:46.878
Well. since Casey
lost her scene partner

1944
01:30:46.947 --> 01:30:49.109
and everything else
that's happened today.

1945
01:30:49.178 --> 01:30:52.482
I felt this would
be the best replacement.

1946
01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:53.819
Any objections?

1947
01:30:55.455 --> 01:30:56.789
I didn't think so.

1948
01:30:58.154 --> 01:31:01.991
What the hell is going on
with you. Jason?

1949
01:31:02.060 --> 01:31:04.230
-You wanna fucking know?
-Yeah. I wanna know!

1950
01:31:04.299 --> 01:31:05.231
-Yeah?
-Yeah!

1951
01:31:05.300 --> 01:31:06.430
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1952
01:31:06.499 --> 01:31:09.400
Ms. Long. why this?

1953
01:31:09.469 --> 01:31:11.672
-Why now?
-Why not?

1954
01:31:12.802 --> 01:31:14.035
Nice Band-Aid.

1955
01:31:14.103 --> 01:31:16.006
Not what I was thinking.
but I get it.

1956
01:31:16.074 --> 01:31:17.576
You know.
I hurt somebody. okay?

1957
01:31:17.644 --> 01:31:19.444
-Who?
-I fucking hurt somebody.

1958
01:31:19.513 --> 01:31:21.344
This girl. I got a girl...

1959
01:31:21.413 --> 01:31:23.147
What?

1960
01:31:23.215 --> 01:31:26.751
-I got a girl pregnant.
-You stupid son of a bitch.

1961
01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:28.883
Okay. now.
you guys have two hours

1962
01:31:28.952 --> 01:31:30.456
to complete the assignment.

1963
01:31:30.525 --> 01:31:31.960
And maybe this day will be over.

1964
01:31:32.028 --> 01:31:34.094
Thank God.

1965
01:31:34.163 --> 01:31:36.095
It's a big maybe.

1966
01:31:36.164 --> 01:31:37.993
Okay.

1967
01:31:38.062 --> 01:31:40.529
Sorry there.
I didn't mean to...

1968
01:31:40.598 --> 01:31:42.798
The last time?

1969
01:31:42.867 --> 01:31:45.503
Won't happen again. I promise.

1970
01:31:45.571 --> 01:31:47.071
Yeah. sure you won't.

1971
01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:50.244
-Even if I fucking let it.
-Hey. hey. I'm upset.

1972
01:31:50.312 --> 01:31:52.042
A lot has happened today.

1973
01:31:52.111 --> 01:31:56.149
And I want you guys
to write about it all.

1974
01:31:56.217 --> 01:31:57.513
All of it.

1975
01:31:57.581 --> 01:31:58.981
Who knows?

1976
01:31:59.050 --> 01:32:01.216
Maybe the next Neil Simon
is in this room.

1977
01:32:01.285 --> 01:32:03.254
-Not me.
-Have fun.

1978
01:32:03.323 --> 01:32:04.560
Aim high.

1979
01:32:05.627 --> 01:32:06.989
You're ruining your life.
son.

1980
01:32:07.058 --> 01:32:09.028
You don't know
what you're doing.

1981
01:32:09.097 --> 01:32:11.260
You can't even take care
of yourself. let alone a kid.

1982
01:32:11.328 --> 01:32:13.000
You don't got to worry
about it anymore. okay?

1983
01:32:13.069 --> 01:32:14.931
She...

1984
01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.571
She's not pregnant
anymore. okay?

1985
01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:18.667
I wasn't there for her.
I wasn't there

1986
01:32:18.736 --> 01:32:20.906
when she got hurt.

1987
01:32:26.415 --> 01:32:28.078
Come here. Come here. son.

1988
01:32:30.579 --> 01:32:32.685
-You really got hurt. huh?
-Who fucking cares. okay?

1989
01:32:32.754 --> 01:32:34.049
She tried to kill herself
because of me.

1990
01:32:34.117 --> 01:32:35.788
-Jason.
-I deserve it. Say it.

1991
01:32:35.857 --> 01:32:37.389
You always fucking say it.
Just say it.

1992
01:32:37.458 --> 01:32:39.126
Jason. look at me.

1993
01:32:39.195 --> 01:32:40.327
Look at me. son.

1994
01:32:40.395 --> 01:32:41.694
I'm not your son. man.

1995
01:32:41.762 --> 01:32:44.259
I know. I'm--
but I think of you as...

1996
01:32:47.965 --> 01:32:49.737
I mean. they can't flunk us all.

1997
01:32:50.669 --> 01:32:52.002
Actually. they can.

1998
01:32:52.071 --> 01:32:54.871
-I don't care.
-Yes. you do.

1999
01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:56.376
-We all do.
-Okay.

2000
01:32:56.444 --> 01:32:58.075
But what about Jason?

2001
01:32:58.874 --> 01:33:00.747
What about him?

2002
01:33:00.816 --> 01:33:02.278
I wonder what's happening
to him right now.

2003
01:33:02.346 --> 01:33:05.016
Shit. he's probably suspended
at least. guys.

2004
01:33:10.491 --> 01:33:11.857
What do you want from me?

2005
01:33:11.926 --> 01:33:13.625
I'm not saying
it's your fault. but...

2006
01:33:13.694 --> 01:33:15.024
Guys. whatever we do.

2007
01:33:15.093 --> 01:33:17.265
we need to do
for all of us. okay?

2008
01:33:17.334 --> 01:33:19.367
-Including Jason.
-Right.

2009
01:33:19.436 --> 01:33:21.663
As a group. a class.

2010
01:33:21.732 --> 01:33:23.536
He's part of us.

2011
01:33:23.605 --> 01:33:25.235
So what. we all take the bullet?

2012
01:33:25.303 --> 01:33:28.371
What he did back there.
he did for all of us.

2013
01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:29.942
So yeah.

2014
01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:32.307
Uh-hmm.

2015
01:33:34.116 --> 01:33:35.145
Michael?

2016
01:33:39.254 --> 01:33:40.485
All right.

2017
01:33:40.553 --> 01:33:42.020
What can I say?

2018
01:33:43.021 --> 01:33:45.520
-You're right.

2019
01:33:45.589 --> 01:33:47.161
Wow.

2020
01:33:47.230 --> 01:33:48.696
This morning.

2021
01:33:48.765 --> 01:33:50.732
never would've guessed
I'd back him.

2022
01:33:51.697 --> 01:33:53.063
It's come a long way

2023
01:33:53.132 --> 01:33:54.701
-since- 00 AM.
-Yup.

2024
01:33:54.769 --> 01:33:56.364
-Yeah. no kidding.
-Yeah.

2025
01:33:58.271 --> 01:34:00.940
Can imagine what his parents
are doing to him just about now.

2026
01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:03.338
Yeah. poor guy.

2027
01:34:05.512 --> 01:34:06.847
I miss 'em.

2028
01:34:09.214 --> 01:34:11.313
Uh. I think about them
all the time.

2029
01:34:14.784 --> 01:34:16.252
My mom...

2030
01:34:17.853 --> 01:34:19.321
my dad.

2031
01:34:29.097 --> 01:34:30.838
Why did they have to die?

2032
01:34:37.008 --> 01:34:38.813
I don't know why I'm this way.

2033
01:34:38.882 --> 01:34:40.948
I don't know why I do this shit
that I do. you know?

2034
01:34:41.016 --> 01:34:43.150
I don't know why
I'm so fucking scared to love.

2035
01:34:43.219 --> 01:34:44.345
I just...

2036
01:34:44.414 --> 01:34:46.251
Hey. hey. don't be so hard
on yourself.

2037
01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:49.087
But I just like feel them
around me sometimes. you know?

2038
01:34:49.155 --> 01:34:51.321
And I don't-- I don't
fucking understand. okay?

2039
01:34:51.390 --> 01:34:55.061
I just-- I just-- some days.
I just-- I need them.

2040
01:34:55.130 --> 01:34:56.797
I wish that they were there.
I wish I could just

2041
01:34:56.866 --> 01:34:58.932
-fucking tell them. you know?
-Yeah.

2042
01:34:59.967 --> 01:35:01.196
You know.
some days I just wish

2043
01:35:01.265 --> 01:35:04.171
that they could hug me.
you know?

2044
01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:05.268
Yeah.

2045
01:35:08.205 --> 01:35:10.438
I mean. I fucking
miss them. man.

2046
01:35:12.115 --> 01:35:13.210
So do I.

2047
01:35:15.344 --> 01:35:16.615
-I got you.

2048
01:35:16.683 --> 01:35:18.116
I got you. I got you.

2049
01:35:25.661 --> 01:35:27.624
-Jessie?
-Yeah?

2050
01:35:27.693 --> 01:35:29.196
Does it hurt?

2051
01:35:29.265 --> 01:35:30.293
What...

2052
01:35:31.301 --> 01:35:32.493
What you have?

2053
01:35:33.698 --> 01:35:34.935
Yeah.

2054
01:35:36.802 --> 01:35:38.334
Sometimes it does.

2055
01:35:39.607 --> 01:35:41.007
Are you gonna be okay?

2056
01:35:41.839 --> 01:35:43.108
I don't know.

2057
01:35:44.813 --> 01:35:46.714
Guess I gotta hope
for the best

2058
01:35:46.783 --> 01:35:49.411
and prepare
for the worst. but...

2059
01:35:50.683 --> 01:35:51.985
I'm scared.

2060
01:35:54.090 --> 01:35:56.818
Well. it's nothing worse
than what's going on in my head.

2061
01:36:00.223 --> 01:36:02.457
Michael. Oh. my God.

2062
01:36:05.297 --> 01:36:07.867
We all need to start living
for today.

2063
01:36:07.936 --> 01:36:09.232
I mean. start changing
the things

2064
01:36:09.301 --> 01:36:11.506
that really need changing.
you know?

2065
01:36:11.575 --> 01:36:13.537
I'd say that's hard enough.

2066
01:36:13.606 --> 01:36:14.771
Yeah.

2067
01:36:14.839 --> 01:36:16.444
Will it matter?

2068
01:36:16.512 --> 01:36:18.204
It's regret that matters.

2069
01:36:18.273 --> 01:36:20.409
Well. what about you. Max?

2070
01:36:22.282 --> 01:36:24.252
I'm definitely gonna regret
getting an F.

2071
01:36:25.717 --> 01:36:27.287
Same.

2072
01:36:28.618 --> 01:36:30.754
You know.
one thing I know for sure.

2073
01:36:30.823 --> 01:36:32.827
serious when I say this.

2074
01:36:32.896 --> 01:36:35.259
your parents loved you
very. very much.

2075
01:36:37.427 --> 01:36:38.962
Your dad.
my little baby brother

2076
01:36:39.031 --> 01:36:41.362
talked about you every day.

2077
01:36:41.431 --> 01:36:44.005
You're the best thing
in his life

2078
01:36:44.073 --> 01:36:45.632
from the moment you arrived
in that hospital.

2079
01:36:45.701 --> 01:36:47.739
from the moment
you opened your eyes. man.

2080
01:36:47.807 --> 01:36:50.439
he just... loved you.

2081
01:36:52.309 --> 01:36:54.344
-He said that?
-Oh. he said that. yeah.

2082
01:36:55.417 --> 01:36:56.445
Every day.

2083
01:36:59.018 --> 01:37:01.315
And your mom. she loved you.

2084
01:37:01.384 --> 01:37:03.591
She just wanted
the best for you.

2085
01:37:03.660 --> 01:37:05.987
To live life to the fullest.

2086
01:37:06.056 --> 01:37:08.091
You know. I think...

2087
01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:10.459
I know that they are here
right now.

2088
01:37:11.499 --> 01:37:12.694
Right now.

2089
01:37:12.763 --> 01:37:14.034
God.

2090
01:37:15.672 --> 01:37:17.403
You look so much
like your mom.

2091
01:37:17.472 --> 01:37:18.500
You do.

2092
01:37:19.572 --> 01:37:20.601
Hey.

2093
01:37:21.907 --> 01:37:23.439
Don't be scared to love.

2094
01:37:25.074 --> 01:37:26.409
This girl...

2095
01:37:27.681 --> 01:37:29.016
did you love her?

2096
01:37:29.848 --> 01:37:31.319
I don't love.

2097
01:37:31.388 --> 01:37:32.486
Of course you do.

2098
01:37:32.555 --> 01:37:33.616
Just think of them.

2099
01:37:34.485 --> 01:37:38.125
Nothing's worse
than guilt and remorse.

2100
01:37:38.961 --> 01:37:40.423
And I've learned
to live with that.

2101
01:37:41.497 --> 01:37:42.590
It's not you.

2102
01:37:44.729 --> 01:37:46.268
Jason...

2103
01:37:47.670 --> 01:37:49.737
I've let you down. I know.

2104
01:37:49.806 --> 01:37:51.031
-It's okay.
-No. it's not.

2105
01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:52.868
It's not okay.

2106
01:37:52.936 --> 01:37:54.239
I'm sorry.

2107
01:37:55.976 --> 01:37:58.079
But I want you to know that...

2108
01:37:58.148 --> 01:38:00.907
your parents would be
very proud of you right now.

2109
01:38:00.976 --> 01:38:01.944
as am I.

2110
01:38:06.987 --> 01:38:09.056
-I love you.

2111
01:38:11.593 --> 01:38:12.961
I love you too.

2112
01:38:15.596 --> 01:38:16.690
Thank you.

2113
01:38:20.602 --> 01:38:22.696
Oh. okay. So...

2114
01:38:23.804 --> 01:38:25.305
what do we do now?

2115
01:38:25.374 --> 01:38:26.540
About...

2116
01:38:26.609 --> 01:38:27.908
About these papers.

2117
01:38:27.976 --> 01:38:29.708
Well.
we have to do something.

2118
01:38:29.777 --> 01:38:30.840
I don't know what to do.

2119
01:38:30.909 --> 01:38:32.310
Yeah. either.

2120
01:38:33.275 --> 01:38:34.950
How hard can it be?

2121
01:38:35.751 --> 01:38:36.879
I don't like that face.

2122
01:38:42.953 --> 01:38:44.152
Michael...

2123
01:38:44.220 --> 01:38:45.654
what are you writing?

2124
01:38:46.624 --> 01:38:48.590
Well. she says
we can say anything. right?

2125
01:38:54.236 --> 01:38:56.466
-Uh-uh. Now. what you up to?
-Let me...

2126
01:38:57.640 --> 01:38:59.304
Calm as a bitch. huh.

2127
01:39:00.337 --> 01:39:01.841
Can she really give us an F?

2128
01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:04.005
-Yeah. she can.
-Yeah.

2129
01:39:04.074 --> 01:39:06.175
Like a real F?

2130
01:39:06.244 --> 01:39:07.681
We're about to fail theater?

2131
01:39:07.750 --> 01:39:09.077
-No.

2132
01:39:09.146 --> 01:39:10.818
I think we all--

2133
01:39:10.887 --> 01:39:11.980
-I think so.
-I don't know.

2134
01:39:15.625 --> 01:39:17.487
No. I can't.

2135
01:39:20.589 --> 01:39:23.828
<i> ♪ And it's hard ♪</i>

2136
01:39:23.897 --> 01:39:25.761
<i>♪ I know ♪</i>

2137
01:39:25.830 --> 01:39:30.368
<i>♪ But these feelings</i>
<i>They come and go ♪</i>

2138
01:39:31.368 --> 01:39:34.042
<i>♪ 'Cause we try ♪</i>

2139
01:39:45.682 --> 01:39:47.352
What are you writing about?

2140
01:39:47.421 --> 01:39:49.253
Mike. your handwriting
is trash. bro.

2141
01:39:49.322 --> 01:39:51.257
-Man. screw you.
-Whoa. whoa. whoa.

2142
01:39:51.326 --> 01:39:53.121
I'm just saying.
like. I got chicken scratch.

2143
01:39:53.190 --> 01:39:54.655
you got rooster scratch.

2144
01:39:54.724 --> 01:39:57.028
You know. like.
you got jokes. huh?

2145
01:39:57.097 --> 01:39:58.565
Oh. he got jokes today. man.

2146
01:39:58.634 --> 01:40:00.029
Okay. kids.

2147
01:40:00.098 --> 01:40:01.795
Put those pens down.

2148
01:40:01.864 --> 01:40:03.801
Whoa. whoa.
I'm not finished yet.

2149
01:40:03.870 --> 01:40:05.104
You are now.

2150
01:40:05.173 --> 01:40:07.434
Uh. guys.
I asked for five pages.

2151
01:40:07.503 --> 01:40:09.272
I see barely anything written.

2152
01:40:09.341 --> 01:40:11.242
It's all there. Ms. Long.

2153
01:40:11.311 --> 01:40:13.681
what you asked
us to write. I mean.

2154
01:40:13.749 --> 01:40:15.650
Uh. how so?

2155
01:40:15.718 --> 01:40:16.816
How we changed today.

2156
01:40:16.884 --> 01:40:19.350
laid bare on the page.

2157
01:40:19.419 --> 01:40:21.385
-Yeah.
-It's bare. all right.

2158
01:40:21.454 --> 01:40:23.316
The walls
you helped us break down.

2159
01:40:23.385 --> 01:40:24.818
This is what you wanted.

2160
01:40:24.887 --> 01:40:26.390
Oh. what I wanted
was for you guys

2161
01:40:26.459 --> 01:40:28.360
to learn how to express
yourselves.

2162
01:40:28.429 --> 01:40:31.163
Yeah. we're like
a science experiment to you.

2163
01:40:31.232 --> 01:40:32.360
Is that what you think?

2164
01:40:32.429 --> 01:40:34.135
Does it really matter to you.

2165
01:40:34.203 --> 01:40:36.771
or you Mr. Faulk.
what any of us thinks?

2166
01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:38.733
Nobody was prepared for this.

2167
01:40:38.801 --> 01:40:40.536
Just trying to open you up.
that's all.

2168
01:40:40.605 --> 01:40:42.170
Yeah. And how'd
that work out for you?

2169
01:40:42.239 --> 01:40:43.838
Hey. she did it. not me.

2170
01:40:43.906 --> 01:40:45.843
That sounds like
something one of us would say.

2171
01:40:47.276 --> 01:40:48.610
There you go.

2172
01:40:48.679 --> 01:40:50.248
I am just trying to help you

2173
01:40:50.317 --> 01:40:52.148
break through those walls
and the things

2174
01:40:52.216 --> 01:40:53.687
that hold us all back.

2175
01:40:53.756 --> 01:40:55.986
It almost tore us apart.

2176
01:40:56.054 --> 01:40:57.718
Almost.

2177
01:40:57.787 --> 01:40:59.156
You wanna know
what the hardest part

2178
01:40:59.225 --> 01:41:00.724
about being here today was?

2179
01:41:00.793 --> 01:41:02.295
Tell me.

2180
01:41:02.363 --> 01:41:03.624
The hardest part
of this class

2181
01:41:03.693 --> 01:41:05.063
was learning
how to be ourselves.

2182
01:41:05.132 --> 01:41:06.196
Each of us mattered.

2183
01:41:06.265 --> 01:41:08.296
But now we matter to each other.

2184
01:41:08.365 --> 01:41:10.131
Oh. a bunch of hypocrites.

2185
01:41:11.635 --> 01:41:12.839
You know. frankly.
it doesn't really matter

2186
01:41:12.907 --> 01:41:14.208
who you think we are.

2187
01:41:15.074 --> 01:41:16.072
I'll still be gay.

2188
01:41:16.141 --> 01:41:17.470
I'll still be sick.

2189
01:41:17.539 --> 01:41:19.275
I'll still be neurotic.

2190
01:41:19.344 --> 01:41:20.610
We'll still be all of that.

2191
01:41:21.579 --> 01:41:23.547
But now. maybe this time
we'll be friends.

2192
01:41:24.621 --> 01:41:26.051
Hundred percent.

2193
01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:28.118
We just got to be ourselves

2194
01:41:28.187 --> 01:41:29.454
out there where it counts.

2195
01:41:31.561 --> 01:41:32.990
Fail one.

2196
01:41:33.059 --> 01:41:35.255
Fail us all.

2197
01:41:37.934 --> 01:41:39.464
Did you guys rehearse that?

2198
01:41:40.529 --> 01:41:42.564
-Jason. too.
-Yeah.

2199
01:41:42.633 --> 01:41:44.831
Yeah. we're one
for Jason as well.

2200
01:41:44.900 --> 01:41:46.671
You guys
are breaking my heart.

2201
01:41:46.739 --> 01:41:48.676
But can somebody tell me
what the hell happened here?

2202
01:41:48.745 --> 01:41:49.904
Hard to grasp. huh?

2203
01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:53.575
Mr. Faulk. there are plenty
of available counselors

2204
01:41:53.644 --> 01:41:55.379
-for you to talk to.
-Touche. kid.

2205
01:41:55.447 --> 01:41:56.617
-Nice one.

2206
01:41:57.613 --> 01:42:00.183
All right. guys. I get it. okay?

2207
01:42:00.252 --> 01:42:02.322
What do you mean. okay?

2208
01:42:02.391 --> 01:42:04.657
Maybe I should change the way
I give finals.

2209
01:42:04.726 --> 01:42:06.354
but...

2210
01:42:06.423 --> 01:42:08.593
I'm giving you all... A's.

2211
01:42:08.661 --> 01:42:10.660
Wait a minute.
Wait. wait. wait. wait.

2212
01:42:10.728 --> 01:42:12.299
-You can't do that.

2213
01:42:12.368 --> 01:42:13.360
-I can!
-No. you can't.

2214
01:42:15.070 --> 01:42:16.666
Sorry. yeah. I just-- yeah.

2215
01:42:16.735 --> 01:42:18.331
-There we go.
-You can't do that.

2216
01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:19.674
Yes. she can.

2217
01:42:19.743 --> 01:42:21.241
I can and I would.

2218
01:42:21.310 --> 01:42:23.139
I don't give a shit
what you think.

2219
01:42:23.208 --> 01:42:25.342
So get out of here.

2220
01:42:25.410 --> 01:42:26.708
-Go on.
-You know what?

2221
01:42:26.777 --> 01:42:28.012
-Please.
-I'm going to track.

2222
01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:29.381
Bye. Mr. Faulk.

2223
01:42:29.450 --> 01:42:30.578
Have a nice weekend.
Mr. Faulk.

2224
01:42:30.647 --> 01:42:32.649
That's a shame.
Look at him.

2225
01:42:34.582 --> 01:42:36.323
I won't forget today.

2226
01:42:39.322 --> 01:42:41.955
The class is...

2227
01:42:44.029 --> 01:42:45.395
dismissed.

2228
01:42:45.463 --> 01:42:47.096
-Yes.

2229
01:42:47.165 --> 01:42:48.498
Finally.

2230
01:42:48.567 --> 01:42:51.637
-And scene.

2231
01:42:51.706 --> 01:42:55.372
<i> ♪ Oh. I'm singing</i>
<i>Na. na. na. na ♪</i>

2232
01:42:55.441 --> 01:42:58.813
<i>♪ What a beautiful life ♪</i>

2233
01:42:58.881 --> 01:43:00.047
Bye. Ms. Long.

2234
01:43:00.116 --> 01:43:03.413
<i> ♪ Oh. na. na. na. na ♪</i>

2235
01:43:03.482 --> 01:43:06.348

2236
01:43:06.417 --> 01:43:08.888

Oh. my goodness.

2239
01:43:12.228 --> 01:43:13.455
So what are you guys
doing later?

2240
01:43:13.524 --> 01:43:14.823
We're never doing that.

2241
01:43:17.563 --> 01:43:20.097
Got some explaining
to do at home.

2242
01:43:20.165 --> 01:43:21.968
You'll be fine.

2243
01:43:22.036 --> 01:43:23.671
Yeah. I'm not so sure.

2244
01:43:23.740 --> 01:43:24.806
You will be.

2245
01:43:24.874 --> 01:43:26.703
Here. Give me your phone.

2246
01:43:30.075 --> 01:43:31.345
Okay.

2247
01:43:32.112 --> 01:43:33.442
Here is my number.

2248
01:43:33.511 --> 01:43:35.211
Call me or text me anytime.

2249
01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:36.646
anything you need.

2250
01:43:36.715 --> 01:43:38.550
I might give it
to some football guys.

2251
01:43:39.317 --> 01:43:41.155
No. but seriously.

2252
01:43:41.224 --> 01:43:42.453
I'd be happy
just to hear it ring.

2253
01:43:42.522 --> 01:43:44.919
so whatever you need.
I mean it.

2254
01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:47.020
Appreciate it.

2255
01:43:49.461 --> 01:43:50.797
Is your dad really that rich?

2256
01:43:52.528 --> 01:43:54.500
Yeah. Yeah. he is.

2257
01:43:55.335 --> 01:43:57.932
Hey. if you ever need a couch.

2258
01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:00.935
You sure? I might.

2259
01:44:01.971 --> 01:44:03.208
I mean. what are you all
doing tonight?

2260
01:44:03.277 --> 01:44:04.642
You wanna hang or something?

2261
01:44:04.710 --> 01:44:06.314
I have this
stupid dinner event

2262
01:44:06.383 --> 01:44:07.742
with my dad tonight.
I can't get out of it.

2263

01:45:40.405 --> 01:45:41.838
Hey. singer.

2301
01:45:44.612 --> 01:45:46.508
I'm sorry for being
so sensitive before.

2302
01:45:46.576 --> 01:45:48.042
You have your reasons.

2303
01:45:49.619 --> 01:45:52.012
Sorry for being so doom
and gloom all the time.

2304
01:45:52.081 --> 01:45:53.751
Yeah. well. I guess
you had yours too.

2305
01:45:58.124 --> 01:45:59.521

And I think
you're a great singer.

2314
01:46:25.485 --> 01:46:26.612
Sure you don't want me to wait?

2315
01:46:26.681 --> 01:46:29.154
No. I'm good.

2316
01:46:29.223 --> 01:46:30.854
All right. Well. uh.

2317
01:46:30.923 --> 01:46:32.724
you've been on
those sunflower seeds. huh?

2318
01:46:36.796 --> 01:46:38.862
All right. kid.
I don't wanna see you next week.

2319
01:46:42.498 --> 01:46:44.002
Jessie.

2320
01:46:44.071 --> 01:46:45.673
Oh. uh...

2321
01:46:45.741 --> 01:46:48.341
Thank you for letting
me use the guitar. Mr. Faulk.

2322
01:46:48.410 --> 01:46:49.672
I'm sorry.
I forgot to drop it off.

2323
01:46:49.741 --> 01:46:51.304
Oh. don't worry about it.

2324
01:46:51.373 --> 01:46:53.108
Listen. I was thinking.
there's that annual talent show

2325
01:46:53.177 --> 01:46:55.179
that the school has.
It's coming up in a few weeks.

2326
01:46:55.248 --> 01:46:56.777
Yeah. I know.

2327
01:46:56.846 --> 01:46:58.750
Well. you sing really good. kid.

2328
01:46:59.385 --> 01:47:00.580
Thank you. Mr. Faulk.

2329
01:47:01.416 --> 01:47:03.221
You know. someone once told me
that you did. too.

2330
01:47:03.290 --> 01:47:04.723
No. it was a hack.

2331
01:47:05.660 --> 01:47:07.487
I wanna see you
at that talent show.

2332
01:47:07.556 --> 01:47:08.990
What?

2333
01:47:09.059 --> 01:47:11.626
Keep the guitar.
You're gonna need it.

2334
01:47:19.274 --> 01:47:20.404
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

2335
01:47:20.472 --> 01:47:21.571
don't worry about it.

2336
01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:23.038
Just don't tell anybody. okay?

2337
01:47:23.107 --> 01:47:24.837
Because I have about
a shred of a reputation

2338
01:47:24.906 --> 01:47:26.613
to protect around here.

2339
01:47:27.611 --> 01:47:28.910
