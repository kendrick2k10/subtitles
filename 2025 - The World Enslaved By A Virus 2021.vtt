00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:55.583
You know what that is sure I do those 
are mine. That's a felony no even worse  

5
00:02:56.208 --> 00:03:01.791
it's high treason to own those books. those 
books include the worst forms conspiracies  

6
00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:06.625
they're like a plague and virus 
to take over the body reading it  

7
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:13.583
where are these books from? Wouldn't the 
better question be when are those books  

8
00:03:13.583 --> 00:03:21.583
from? That doesn't matter to me. I think it does 
they are from a time when life was different

9
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:27.791
From a time when we could meet 
our friends go to restaurants  

10
00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:31.958
celebrate whatever and whenever we wanted to.

11
00:03:56.291 --> 00:04:03.958
The time when life was worth living a world full
of peace love and ice cream do you remember the best  

12
00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:12.125
ice cream in the World. We had hope and we had 
freedom a place we could proudly call our home  

13
00:04:13.791 --> 00:04:20.208
and those two books secured what 
we wanted to live a combination of  

14
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:27.958
through state and believe regulated 
self-regulation and freedom. Life is different now  

15
00:04:29.083 --> 00:04:32.916
we can't change that I might 
as well just adapt to it  

16
00:04:34.458 --> 00:04:39.625
I don't want to live a life like that where 
I can't do the most important thing of my life  

17
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:49.500
to believe. I want to fight I don't just 
want to give up I want to make a difference  

18
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.750
and if everyone would start thinking like 
that we could really achieve something big  

19
00:04:55.708 --> 00:05:02.541
we can shift something around. This 
book was the legal code of germany  

20
00:05:02.541 --> 00:05:06.125
before the global state developed 
an english got our world language  

21
00:05:07.333 --> 00:05:14.541
I received this book at university during my 
time in 2020 the year when everything broke apart  

22
00:05:15.166 --> 00:05:20.833
the state leaders came up with new regulations 
to repress the people and secure their power  

23
00:05:22.833 --> 00:05:26.833
the excuse was virus something they sold us  

24
00:05:26.833 --> 00:05:34.208
as a super deadly killer virus. the state leaders 
started to take away our rights and our freedom

25
00:05:36.625 --> 00:05:47.250
for the sake of the good the good for everyone. You 
know every time they took a ride from us and gave  

26
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:56.458
us a law I crossed out the law in our legale Code of Germany
see and I wrote the date next to it  

27
00:05:57.166 --> 00:06:02.375
for example they deleted the right on the 25th of 
october 21.

28
00:06:12.375 --> 00:06:13.750
Or another one down here

29
00:06:22.833 --> 00:06:25.791
Do you see. how many they took from us?

30
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.625
Our this one

31
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.416
they took that right

32
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.541
Guys. guys it's Jack

33
00:07:08.666 --> 00:07:19.166
This can't be true. arrested tortured and 
killed. guys he was a friend our brother

34
00:07:23.416 --> 00:07:29.958
Friends hey I think we have to stop this 
this is taking way too many casualties  

35
00:07:30.666 --> 00:07:38.208
No we were hiding for the 
last five years we just met

36
00:07:40.833 --> 00:07:48.541
I think instead of hiding we should do something 
to end all that. I don't want to start something  

37
00:07:48.541 --> 00:07:54.458
that can lead us to more death. you know i'm 
not I would much rather hide I want to live  

38
00:07:54.458 --> 00:08:00.125
I don't want to give up my life I don't 
want to lose it. What kind of life is that  

39
00:08:01.083 --> 00:08:06.625
I agree with Roy we have to do something 
we cannot hide it here forever because we  

40
00:08:06.625 --> 00:08:13.500
know the truth. Guys don't we all believe in a 
loving and protective God who has a plan for us  

41
00:08:14.916 --> 00:08:17.583
I don't know what to believe in anymore what

42
00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:26.458
Yeah what does that mean. I mean what 
what's your point what's your plan?

43
00:08:27.416 --> 00:08:33.791
I don't know. See I when I sleep I can't sleep 
anymore. I got these anxiety attacks when I walk  

44
00:08:33.791 --> 00:08:39.958
on the street it feels like somebody's watching me 
the whole time it's killing me it tears me apart  

45
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:48.625
I thought maybe. like I want this to end you know 
guys I want I want this to end I love you guys  

46
00:08:48.625 --> 00:08:55.583
you're my family. Yeah we are I mean. And I cannot 
see another family member die. I wanted to stop

47
00:08:57.708 --> 00:09:02.833
Guys I'm sorry but I'm out I gotta quit. No 
but. we're all in the same situation I mean

48
00:09:03.625 --> 00:09:19.416
stop. So what now. I won't give up the fight. 
neither will I. I want to make a difference  

49
00:09:20.208 --> 00:09:25.791
I want to change the world we're living in 
and I want to make jesus be glorified again

50
00:09:28.375 --> 00:09:36.541
how can we achieve that. I don't know I kept 
thinking about I mean the things that luke said  

51
00:09:36.541 --> 00:09:43.416
are true and I see police officers I always like 
get almost paranoid that they could catch me or  

52
00:09:44.291 --> 00:09:53.583
yeah chase me if they find out who we are. You know 
five years ago we watched those films about the  

53
00:09:53.583 --> 00:10:01.333
countries in the middle east where christianity 
was illegal those movies seemed so far away  

54
00:10:02.208 --> 00:10:09.625
true and and now five years later we are exactly 
in the same situation. Have you expected that

55
00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:25.333
Roy. I feel like we're the only christians left 
in the world but I mean this can't be true right?  

56
00:10:26.375 --> 00:10:32.833
No we had thousands maybe hundred 
thousands of pastors. church leaders

57
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:43.000
I don't know where they are. we had 
so many. It's like they remain silent  

58
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:48.375
I like. like they have
have nothing to say anymore

59
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.250
it would be so important 
for them to stand up for us  

60
00:10:55.166 --> 00:11:02.458
you know what comes to my mind right now is 
christianity when we got born 2 000 years ago  

61
00:11:03.416 --> 00:11:09.000
christianity was illegal. 
True. the story repeats itself

62
00:11:11.083 --> 00:11:16.208
It's ridiculous. you know those 
christians they did not give up  

63
00:11:17.416 --> 00:11:23.083
they somehow survived and it was 
illegal and they met secretly  

64
00:11:23.791 --> 00:11:29.708
and they did not give up and now we're 
those thankful for. that they did not give up  

65
00:11:31.708 --> 00:11:36.666
I'm pretty sure it was hard for them too. 
Yeah and they used the fish symbol to find  

66
00:11:36.666 --> 00:11:43.791
allies. T hat's right remember they they drew 
that one line and then the other person  

67
00:11:45.083 --> 00:11:50.625
yes and then you got the fish 
yeah because we're just us two  

68
00:11:52.625 --> 00:11:59.958
but if we find more christians and we will 
find found a lot of underground churches  

69
00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:07.000
I think we could really change something. We can't 
use the internet you know they are watching it  

70
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.375
they're monitoring it all the time. 
We need to find different ways

71
00:12:14.833 --> 00:12:21.000
You know what. maybe we just give it into god's 
hands we go out. we maybe do those fish  

72
00:12:22.208 --> 00:12:25.333
and maybe god will do something with it yeah  

73
00:12:26.375 --> 00:12:32.458
let's try it I as I said. I won't give up this 
fight and also this is not our fight god will  

74
00:12:32.458 --> 00:12:37.791
fight for us and I'm sure that we find people who 
will fight with us. God is in control and you know  

75
00:12:37.791 --> 00:12:43.083
what I think I got some graffiti back there 
maybe we can just spray fish and maybe find  

76
00:12:43.083 --> 00:12:49.583
some more people and they think the same as we do. 
Right let's do it. let's not wait let's just do it

78
00:15:06.791 --> 00:15:10.541

The bleeding stop you have water

85
00:16:59.166 --> 00:17:07.625
How do you feel are you busy yeah a little bit. 
So do you actually know why we drew those fish  

86
00:17:09.333 --> 00:17:19.083
yeah it's like it's like the old christian symbol 
back in the day isn't it. Yeah so are you  

87
00:17:20.291 --> 00:17:26.541
Am I a christian yeah. Okay. I'm definitely uh 
definitely displeased with the things going  

88
00:17:26.541 --> 00:17:31.500
on in the world today. Yeah I agree. That's why we 
did that because we're trying to find like-minded  

89
00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:36.666
people and um we also want to encourage 
christians other christians are still out there  

90
00:17:36.666 --> 00:17:40.750
we don't know and um we want to encourage 
them we really want to change something  

91
00:17:41.333 --> 00:17:50.291
Yeah what what did you actually do before that?
uh well I was a Marine for two years and then  

92
00:17:50.833 --> 00:17:57.000
you know the virus and everything kicked 
in and so it's pretty much yeah got out  

93
00:17:58.041 --> 00:18:03.083
Well that's why you knew how to do that. Yeah yeah 
of course that's something they teach us and in  

94
00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:09.583
training it's like take care of wounds and stuff.
Mm-hmm yeah I actually. I'm a nurse. Oh really? Yeah  

95
00:18:09.583 --> 00:18:15.583
but I. yeah i had to quit my job and my brother 
he almost got his master's degree in the economy  

96
00:18:16.666 --> 00:18:23.791
yeah but you know how things happen. Yeah 
now our plan is we just spray fish may find  

97
00:18:23.791 --> 00:18:28.458
better plan but that's a plan for now. finding 
like-minded people encouraging christians yeah  

98
00:18:28.458 --> 00:18:32.125
of course um if they see the symbol of 
christianity maybe they get encouraged  

99
00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:38.916
yeah we're trying to change something. Yeah 
well I'm in that sounds awesome let's go  

100
00:18:38.916 --> 00:18:45.708
spread some more fish. That's amazing. Let's 
do it. Thanks. I'm looking for some new sprays  

101
00:18:45.708 --> 00:18:50.833
because I think we forgot them where we went 
but I'm gonna take a look at that all right

102
00:18:50.833 --> 00:18:52.958
cool

103
00:20:24.541 --> 00:20:29.875
So why did you actually leave the marines? 
Well a few a few reasons really uh  

104
00:20:30.916 --> 00:20:38.125
The first one was that I had a girlfriend in 
the army but. it got some points where she was  

105
00:20:38.125 --> 00:20:43.333
like siding with the government really and these 
new ideas that you know you and me both don't like  

106
00:20:43.333 --> 00:20:50.666
and so I just really couldn't bear that anymore 
really live with that. Oh oh i'm sorry. that must be  

107
00:20:50.666 --> 00:20:57.333
hard. Yeah we were together like four years but 
I mean. I'm pretty much over it i'm pretty much  

108
00:20:57.333 --> 00:21:06.458
over it now yeah anyway like the second reason uh 
which uh what is like super horrible my opinion is  

109
00:21:06.458 --> 00:21:13.583
that my leadership actually came down and they're 
going to make me make all of us actually recite  

110
00:21:14.666 --> 00:21:19.416
like the new constitution and like say it 
out loud and pretty much like swear into it  

111
00:21:19.958 --> 00:21:26.375
which like I don't I swear it to nobody 
other than God you know yeah so yeah that's

112
00:21:28.916 --> 00:21:35.000
Yeah I mean I also had to quit my job and 
my brother and I live here from just  

113
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.958
what we saved but as you can imagine 
it's not gonna last for a long time

114
00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:50.833
yeah and our parents they were christians as 
well and we used to go to church every sunday  

115
00:21:50.833 --> 00:21:58.291
we used to have worship times we used to pray. Back 
in the good days. Yeah back in the good days   

116
00:21:59.166 --> 00:22:03.416
yeah but they once this whole 
situation got worse and worse

117
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:13.250
they yeah they decided to end their lives 
because they couldn't find the strength  

118
00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:19.166
to work on you know. I'm so sorry to hear 
that. Yeah I know I know exactly how it feels  

119
00:22:20.375 --> 00:22:26.916
to lose parents because like my parents are 
65 now but it's like although they're living  

120
00:22:26.916 --> 00:22:31.625
like they're not actually living. they 
you know they all I hear like every time I  

121
00:22:32.291 --> 00:22:36.041
every time I call them and stuff they're 
always talking about like the government  

122
00:22:36.041 --> 00:22:40.125
the news and it's like how great is this and 
it's just like I can't bear it like I try to  

123
00:22:40.125 --> 00:22:45.708
open their eyes. I've tried to like you know 
bring light to the situation but it's like  

124
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.333
the more and more they're listening like it 
should it's just hopeless I don't think I can  

125
00:22:51.333 --> 00:22:55.625
I don't think there's anything I can do 
anymore you know. Yeah I'm sorry for that

126
00:22:58.291 --> 00:23:03.791
and um do you live around here or where 
do you live. I live actually like 20  

127
00:23:03.791 --> 00:23:07.958
minutes. I don't even know where this place is 
I'd say about like 20 minutes away from here  

128
00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:15.416
but yeah like to be honest. I don't even feel safe 
with coming back like coming back at all because  

129
00:23:15.958 --> 00:23:19.166
it seems like they're monitoring everything 
and I'm pretty sure there's a good chance  

130
00:23:19.166 --> 00:23:24.666
that they saw what just happened so yeah. 
I know that was also thing that I was  

131
00:23:24.666 --> 00:23:32.625
thinking about I mean you see cameras 
everywhere and police officers and yeah the  

132
00:23:32.625 --> 00:23:38.916
whole monitoring system they actually created over 
the years and so I think they must see everything  

133
00:23:38.916 --> 00:23:46.666
yeah. even our spraying and our gatherings 
are walking arounds and sometimes I think  

134
00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:55.083
why don't they do anything because sometimes they 
yeah they just don't show up and is this because  

135
00:23:56.666 --> 00:24:03.166
there are some co-workers or employees that are 
actually on our side and try to protect us or is  

136
00:24:03.166 --> 00:24:09.083
it just because they have a bad monitoring system 
but I don't know. I don't know but I know what  

137
00:24:09.083 --> 00:24:15.958
you mean though it seems like we're being watched 
like all the time. yeah all the time. but so yeah  

138
00:24:15.958 --> 00:24:22.541
do you think I could actually stay with you like
here? Yeah sure I mean um Roy would be super happy  

139
00:24:22.541 --> 00:24:28.125
and okay awesome! We love you being part of us 
now. Yeah of course. Cool welcome. oh appreciate it

140
00:24:31.166 --> 00:24:37.791
Sorry I've been looking at this guitar for 
forever. do you play? Actually sometimes I try to  

141
00:24:39.791 --> 00:24:42.458
I'm not very good. It just takes practice really

142
00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.833
I used to play in the 
band at my church actually

00:24:48.833 --> 00:24:52.458
Oh that's pretty cool. yeah that's 
kind of like where I learned to play

153
00:27:41.791 --> 00:27:47.958
What do you call a fish without an eye

154
00:27:48.708 --> 00:27:54.875
Fish without an eye?
FSSHHHH

155
00:27:58.583 --> 00:28:01.083
Common Roy

156
00:28:01.083 --> 00:28:01.958
oh

157
00:28:16.625 --> 00:28:22.375
All right let's let's do the fish here. Okay. 
Come on show me what you got me yes

158
00:28:27.333 --> 00:28:29.958
You should spray on the floor

159
00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:49.583
Now do the eye

160
00:29:08.291 --> 00:29:11.958
let's go

161
00:29:20.916 --> 00:29:23.166
oh

162
00:29:33.958 --> 00:29:39.958
Yeah even at christian movies in 2020

163
00:29:43.166 --> 00:29:46.916
here

164
00:29:59.583 --> 00:30:05.791
[Singing]

165
00:31:35.166 --> 00:31:39.875
Who's that? I don't know. Are you 
a traitor? Did you sell us out? 

166
00:31:39.875 --> 00:31:42.541
I didn't sell you out. what do you 
mean I don't know who's at the door.  

167
00:31:42.541 --> 00:31:47.708
Nobody knew that we were here. Well then 
why don't we open the door? Open the door.

168
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:06.375
Who are you? What do you want here? I am holly 
and I want to help. How did you find us here?  

169
00:32:06.375 --> 00:32:13.958
Nobody knows this place. That wasn't hard I am what 
you might call a hacker. And what do you want here?

170
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.791
So as I said. I want to help. And 
why should we trust you maybe  

171
00:32:19.791 --> 00:32:24.666
you're the sergeant's best friend. Yeah 
are you wearing a mic? You mean Lucinda?

172
00:32:25.416 --> 00:32:32.458
She's an animal cracker. I know her files the 
things she does. nobody wants to be her friend.

173
00:32:36.041 --> 00:32:41.958
I saw your signs. I researched and 
you reminded me of how the world was  

174
00:32:42.916 --> 00:32:50.625
the people could do whatever they wanted. I don't 
know your Jesus but I believe in freedom of choice

175
00:32:53.958 --> 00:33:03.625
So what kind of stuff can you hack? More or less 
everything. Even the police? Might take an hour or  

176
00:33:03.625 --> 00:33:11.875
two but yes. Wow the police have everyone 
on its radar. Yeah so how could that help? 

177
00:33:15.875 --> 00:33:22.625
So I found you like that. I don't 
know if we need that but I could  

178
00:33:22.625 --> 00:33:28.833
find all the christians that are still 
out there. Really as possible? Yes it is.

179
00:33:31.708 --> 00:33:37.791
Wow that's an amazing chance for us! Hannah 
you remember when luke left our group we thought  

180
00:33:37.791 --> 00:33:42.458
about bringing christians together so we can 
build small churches and we spread those fish  

181
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.125
But no one really reached out to us. okay Hunter did. but
like you know you got my point.

182
00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:55.875
So what you're telling me is you want to build 
a bunch of small churches? Yeah exactly. Well  

183
00:33:55.875 --> 00:34:03.708
then we gotta find these christians and and 
build an underground army right? Absolutely. So  

184
00:34:03.708 --> 00:34:11.000
I can do that. I can get all the phone numbers 
of the christians if I hack the police  

185
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:19.958
Wow that's a game changer. That's great so we can 
directly send invitations to the christians? Yes

186
00:34:22.916 --> 00:34:26.208
iI have an idea what if we 
had a bunch of these events  

187
00:34:26.916 --> 00:34:32.375
in different locations. different cities and 
times that way we reach a lot of different  

188
00:34:32.375 --> 00:34:37.000
people but also we're staying under the 
radar with the police. I love that idea.  

189
00:34:40.041 --> 00:34:45.000
but holly can the police find those 
invitations that we understand  

190
00:34:46.541 --> 00:34:49.583
so if I do it right they won't notice.

191
00:34:51.416 --> 00:34:58.625
Then we got a plan. Yeah we absolutely do. but 
we have to plan so we need different locations  

192
00:34:58.625 --> 00:35:02.208
different cities and material because as you 
know. all the christians they don't have  

193
00:35:02.208 --> 00:35:08.458
their bibles anymore and they're christian books 
so we need all that stuff. I could plan the cities  

194
00:35:09.708 --> 00:35:18.291
I can do the dvds with all the material on it so 
they are offline and the government won't notice.  

195
00:35:18.291 --> 00:35:24.541
That is a good point. well I can help you 
finding new locations too yeah. That's  

196
00:35:24.541 --> 00:35:30.125
good. Yeah so it's important that we gain trust 
because I think at the first events they're not  

197
00:35:30.125 --> 00:35:34.916
going to show up a lot of people but as we keep 
on going they're going to show even more people  

198
00:35:37.958 --> 00:35:42.625
Right let's kick that thing off.
Let's do it!

199
00:36:32.458 --> 00:36:35.500
The new list should be IT in 
about 30 minutes go check it out

200
00:36:36.208 --> 00:36:39.958
okay

201
00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:58.000
So. I'm so tired chief has been working all week  

202
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:04.333
I'm gonna go grab a snack. I know 
it's very stressful right now

203
00:38:55.875 --> 00:39:03.708
What are you doing here? I. I just wanted to check 
if the IT is done. don't we all want efficiency?

204
00:39:06.625 --> 00:39:11.958
of course

205
00:39:26.125 --> 00:39:33.708
The world has changed we live once more under a 
dictatorship in communism. we did not learn from  

206
00:39:33.708 --> 00:39:43.625
our past. We are ruled by fear. anxiety. pain and 
rulers not worthy to rule. Our lives turned to just  

207
00:39:43.625 --> 00:39:50.916
live without emotions. without happiness. without 
sadness. without celebrations. without funerals.

208
00:39:51.583 --> 00:39:59.791
Our colors got dark. our whites became grey mixed 
by the government. They decide when your children  

209
00:39:59.791 --> 00:40:07.583
get born. what job you get and when you should die. 
But the freedom that was taken from us and what do  

210
00:40:07.583 --> 00:40:16.666
we do? We hide. we follow. we obey and even if that 
means that our children are getting taken from us.

211
00:40:18.041 --> 00:40:25.250
We just say yes always. remember we used to fight 
for other countries. we freed countries from  

212
00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:32.750
dictators. gave the power back to the people. We 
organized food and medication why did we do that?

213
00:40:33.791 --> 00:40:40.375
because the dignity of man is holy and nobody 
has the right to take that right from us!  

214
00:40:41.333 --> 00:40:47.625
We watched it for too long we were quiet for too 
long and they enslaved us for too long! let's stand

215
00:40:47.625 --> 00:40:54.125
up. let's fight for our freedom for the children of 
our children. They may take our lives but they will  

216
00:40:54.125 --> 00:41:03.625
never take is our freedom. We are humans. created in 
the image of God. freed by Jesus Christ and filled  

217
00:41:03.625 --> 00:41:12.208
by the Holy Spirit. We don't need a fear anymore we 
are children of the most high and we are created  

218
00:41:12.208 --> 00:41:18.750
from the God that created heaven and earth. God 
gave us community and from now on we're not  

219
00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:26.375
gonna give that right away anymore. We're gonna 
meet. we're gonna sing and guess what we're gonna  

220
00:41:26.375 --> 00:41:33.958
get back our country we're gonna get back our 
freedom and we're gonna get back our lives!

221
00:43:43.875 --> 00:43:46.750
Who's that? Actually i don't know

222
00:43:48.916 --> 00:43:59.416
So tell me Dylan why are you here? You know 
last night yesterday night we were gathering my  

223
00:43:59.416 --> 00:44:10.750
sister and my mom two. three others and like in 
my basement and we were praying we're worshiping

224
00:44:13.333 --> 00:44:16.666
yeah and then we heard like knocking on the door

225
00:44:19.083 --> 00:44:26.750
they came in and arrested my sister 
my mom. two of those three friends

226
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:36.916
but I don't know why but they didn't arrest 
me nor that other friend now they're  

227
00:44:38.125 --> 00:44:41.625
at the police waiting for their 
appointment at the court of justice

228
00:44:43.958 --> 00:44:45.000
because of high treason

229
00:44:47.583 --> 00:44:52.833
gonna be killed. I can't do anything 
about it there's nothing I can do

230
00:44:55.625 --> 00:44:56.833
oh man I'm so sorry

231
00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:06.833
So first of all your mom and your sister and those 
that got arrested they're gonna go to heaven and  

232
00:45:06.833 --> 00:45:10.625
they're gonna reach their goal and they're gonna 
have a way better life than we do here on earth  

233
00:45:11.708 --> 00:45:16.750
but losing people have to wait till 
you finally see them happen again  

234
00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:21.333
that's a horrible feeling but they're 
gonna they're gonna go to a better place

235
00:45:24.666 --> 00:45:27.708
but our wounds we have no hearts

236
00:45:29.791 --> 00:45:33.958
just it sounds simple but just Jesus can heal them

237
00:45:36.291 --> 00:45:42.125
and we have to forgive. we have to 
learn to forgive and second

238
00:45:44.541 --> 00:45:52.458
you can't keep on doing what you did you have to 
change because we don't know why the police let  

239
00:45:52.458 --> 00:45:58.541
you alive and let you there but I'm pretty sure 
they had a good reason for that and maybe they're  

240
00:45:59.708 --> 00:46:05.875
they're monitoring they're spying I don't know 
stuff like that and that's also the reason  

241
00:46:05.875 --> 00:46:11.708
why you should be going out of here as fast as 
possible because maybe they're watching you here  

242
00:46:13.083 --> 00:46:19.875
but maybe you can mix some small groups 
in munich and meet in different places

243
00:46:22.041 --> 00:46:27.958
I know god is going to protect us and he has 
a perfect plan and we need to be wise as well  

244
00:46:28.916 --> 00:46:33.500
and we need to fight on and we need to 
actually be happy for the people that are now  

245
00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:41.958
gonna go to heaven they made it they 
reached a goal and we have to fight on here

246
00:46:44.833 --> 00:46:50.125
and you know um we actually 
got some new stuff here  

247
00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:57.708
I think you got the Bible DVDs and the Bible 
study DVDs but we got some worship night DVDs  

248
00:46:58.833 --> 00:47:04.125
with material actually from worship 
nights back in the days and you got that

249
00:47:06.541 --> 00:47:11.791
and we got Bible verses encouraging Bible 
verses and that's pretty new I think you  

250
00:47:11.791 --> 00:47:17.000
will you're one of the first guys getting that 
we got a Bible quiz because it's so important  

251
00:47:17.625 --> 00:47:21.416
that we build relationships down 
here on earth with our fellows and  

252
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:28.375
we need to have like those smiling moments 
again although our friends are getting arrested  

253
00:47:30.041 --> 00:47:33.250
and when you leave Hannah and I we're going to 
pray for you and I think we're going to pray  

254
00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:42.041
for all the christians we need that but he has 
to go yeah no it's dangerous I bring you the

255
00:47:42.041 --> 00:47:43.541
door

256
00:48:24.666 --> 00:48:29.875
Can I get your attention please thank you the 
reason why I talked to you is a fundamental  

257
00:48:29.875 --> 00:48:35.875
importance after the virus first appeared 
chaos was leasing our society our whole way  

258
00:48:35.875 --> 00:48:42.458
of living and this almost destroyed our world. 
To avoid that disaster from happening again  

259
00:48:42.458 --> 00:48:48.541
our great leaders created a system of security 
a system that if every individual obeyed  

260
00:48:49.708 --> 00:48:55.791
would create wealth and prosperity for each 
one. efficiency and above all a united nation.  

261
00:48:56.625 --> 00:49:05.500
United thoughts. unite currency. language and values 
so our job is to maintain this peace and security  

262
00:49:06.208 --> 00:49:10.125
with all our strength of power 
even in eliminating measures  

263
00:49:12.125 --> 00:49:16.291
there is a new rebellion for me 
christians from different cities  

264
00:49:17.083 --> 00:49:23.875
that we thought were our control but are not. 
These revolutionaries threaten our system  

265
00:49:24.666 --> 00:49:31.583
what we fought so hard for they want to destroy 
our system they want they want to bring back  

266
00:49:31.583 --> 00:49:38.458
the deadly structures and the diseases of the 
past they want to kill every human on earth  

267
00:49:39.625 --> 00:49:45.875
so what I expect from you is a lay aside every 
case and put all your efforts eliminating  

268
00:49:47.166 --> 00:49:54.125
these riots. So that the values of 
our system stand firm and moreover  

269
00:49:54.125 --> 00:50:02.375
no more people join that constantly growing 
group. Team. I need you to go let's get this work done  

270
00:50:03.333 --> 00:50:11.958
since this is a real threat do not hold 
back any methods to eliminate this problem

[SINGING]

272

Good job. Sir it's getting worse every day random 
christians meeting at random times and at random  

287
00:56:12.666 --> 00:56:19.583

have no clue no indication whatsoever on who

00:56:19.583 --> 00:56:25.791
the heck would be. Tell me exactly how you came 
about this data? So we have a system where we  

289
00:56:25.791 --> 00:56:32.041
can track the phones of specific groups of people 
including christians and what I've been noticing  

290
00:56:32.041 --> 00:56:37.000
is in about 15 different cities christians 
have been gathering in groups of about 10  

291
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:43.958
to 15 that i've seen here are the 
cases that I have on them right now

292
00:56:48.666 --> 00:56:54.041
Give me 10 minutes I'm going to talk to some 
friends. but tell me again how we don't have  

293
00:56:54.041 --> 00:56:58.916
the head already? I'm I'm not sure it looks 
like they kind of know what they're doing  

294
00:57:00.125 --> 00:57:08.666
I'd guess they have like a specialist or something 
like that. Let's do this.

295
00:57:12.041 --> 00:57:15.625
Lucinda come here

296
00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:27.625
Do you see these? Aren't they beautiful? Yes 
they are but why was I supposed to come?

297
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:34.291
Danger is often hidden in beauty  

298
00:57:35.625 --> 00:57:48.666
And these are dangerous. I don't understand you see 
these are antiques. these are the things that are  

299
00:57:48.666 --> 00:57:54.916
made of history. these are what 
holds people's dreams and these

300
00:57:57.500 --> 00:57:59.875
these represent the christians that I killed

301
00:58:04.458 --> 00:58:10.041
worst thing is that there's a sort of 
spark starting in their heads if that  

302
00:58:10.041 --> 00:58:15.958
spark gains attention then they're going 
to realize the people are heavily oppressed  

303
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:23.500
and it's seriously for their good and health 
but they will long for freedom and their rights  

304
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:30.041
we have to keep the people obedient I have an 
idea the people have to swear every day unto  

305
00:58:30.041 --> 00:58:35.958
the constitution so they have to say that there 
is nothing better and glorious than our state

306
00:58:40.041 --> 00:58:40.625
that's good

307
00:58:43.416 --> 00:58:54.833
go talk to the minister of propaganda let's 
work out a plan I think this will work. I will.

308
00:59:15.791 --> 00:59:22.000
[PHONE RINGS]

309
00:59:24.750 --> 00:59:31.958
Hey how are you? I'm good but I just heard 
something that might be really interesting.  

310
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:40.458
Oh okay what's up? So they know that there 
is a group they know there's your group.  

311
00:59:42.041 --> 00:59:49.583
Do they know our names? I don't think so. but 
they know that there is a group organizing  

312
00:59:49.583 --> 00:59:57.500
and bringing people to god and they plan to do 
something. they want a type of confession to swear  

313
00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:08.125
onto the constitution that must be said every 
morning. Really. that's crazy. It really is so better  

314
01:00:08.125 --> 01:00:15.416
be not in public around these times. You're totally 
right. we are never gonna say something like that.

315
01:00:19.791 --> 01:00:25.791
this is a great decision trust me it will 
change your life radically this cannot

316
01:02:32.125 --> 01:02:38.041
That felt so good. like all the 
pressure is gone. Yeah because it is  

317
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:47.958
let me give you my favorite Bible verse. 
yes. it's in galatians chapter 2 verse 20.  

318
01:02:49.166 --> 01:02:57.333
I have been crucified with christ it is no longer 
I who live. but christ lives in me and the life I  

319
01:02:57.333 --> 01:03:03.625
know live in the flesh I live by faith in the son 
of God who loved me and gave himself up for me.

320
01:03:06.458 --> 01:03:15.958
Ah come here. welcome to the family. Oh thank you!

321
01:03:18.458 --> 01:03:20.833
Hey Hunter. can you come real quick? 
All right one second hold on

322
01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:30.541
Hey what's up Hannah? We've reached 
the 100 000 people goal in asia one  

323
01:03:30.541 --> 01:03:34.541
hundred thousand people? Today yeah. Oh my 
gosh. it's not yesterday we just started  

324
01:03:35.250 --> 01:03:41.500
I know. That's insane but now we need to bring 
all the DVDs to those people. Holly without you  

325
01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:46.375
we would have never reached that. That's a lot 
of people. oh yeah reminds me of uh we're running  

326
01:03:46.375 --> 01:03:52.750
out of DVDs though. so we need new ones. those are 
the ones that we should bring to asia so can you  

327
01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:58.458
give those to Tim because he knows our contact 
down in asia. Yeah i'll do that right now  

328
01:03:58.458 --> 01:04:07.791
perfect thank you. I'll see you guys. try to not make 
so much noise. Who are you? I'm Luc but who are you? 

329
01:04:09.083 --> 01:04:14.291
Luc? Oh man come in. let him in. Roy. 
wait you know. Yeah let's open the door  

330
01:04:16.208 --> 01:04:23.250
Hey man good to see you. Good to see you too.
Man how are you. I'm good Who is this. who's that?

331
01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:30.125
So this is Hunter and this is Holly they're really 
good friends. so but man why are you here? I want to  

332
01:04:30.125 --> 01:04:36.625
warn you guys. it's not about you personally I mean 
you know I like you. um but the world has changed  

333
01:04:36.625 --> 01:04:43.583
significantly and it will never be the same. But 
we can fight back. we can win our nation back and  

334
01:04:43.583 --> 01:04:49.083
our values and you know what we actually got a 
really good chance. that's holly she's a hacker  

335
01:04:49.083 --> 01:04:55.250
and she's really good and she's able to delete 
every track so we really can't win our nation and  

336
01:04:55.250 --> 01:05:00.833
our values back. You don't have values anymore!
The leaders have created a beautiful system  

337
01:05:00.833 --> 01:05:05.875
and they dictate the values now. we just have to 
accept that. Even if we have to deny our faith

338
01:05:05.875 --> 01:05:12.208
for that is that really worth it? Sometimes we have 
to do things. we're not technically proud of what  

339
01:05:12.208 --> 01:05:19.416
we don't want to do but it is good for the sake 
of peace stability and health. So so so what do you  

340
01:05:19.416 --> 01:05:24.375
what do you want man like like what what what's 
your purpose like what do you want from us? I want  

341
01:05:24.375 --> 01:05:29.333
to warn you as I said and I want to highly 
encourage you to stop what you're doing like  

342
01:05:29.333 --> 01:05:33.791
right now immediately because. I think actually 
because of you guys we now have to say the  

343
01:05:33.791 --> 01:05:39.708
world's confession every morning and since I was 
a part of your group not if not that long time ago  

344
01:05:39.708 --> 01:05:44.208
it could be that they will think I'm still a part 
of it you can backfire to me and I don't want that.  

345
01:05:45.583 --> 01:05:51.416
Yeah do you think do you honestly think like this 
like life is just worth living right now. like I  

346
01:05:51.416 --> 01:05:56.666
I'm just asking a question because right now I 
don't have any freedoms i have to ask permission  

347
01:05:56.666 --> 01:06:01.791
we ought to ask permission to do anything 
around here I. I lost my girlfriend. I lost  

348
01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:08.125
my job with the marines. I can't do anything 
anymore so. Yeah but you can't do what you  

349
01:06:08.125 --> 01:06:13.583
used to do the old things are passed all this 
is bad do. You're okay with that like like  

350
01:06:13.583 --> 01:06:18.041
the future doesn't matter. like you're just gonna 
just sit here and just take it that's literally  

351
01:06:18.041 --> 01:06:24.125
what you're gonna do. So luc. you're still one 
of our best friends but maybe you just leave.  

352
01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:31.958
All right come on i'm going let's go see you 
but i warned you don't say it anymore you guys  

353
01:06:47.875 --> 01:06:52.041
And Leila could you maybe organize some 
more DVDs and CDs. we actually ran out of  

354
01:06:52.041 --> 01:07:03.333
them. Really? That's incredible but um I have to 
talk with you about something. About what? You know  

355
01:07:04.291 --> 01:07:09.708
I really didn't have a lot of friends 
actually just my sister and Luc but left and  

356
01:07:12.458 --> 01:07:18.541
I don't know how to interact with people like 
doing speeches that's really my thing but  

357
01:07:19.166 --> 01:07:22.041
like interacting with people 
and especially with girls  

358
01:07:22.625 --> 01:07:32.541
I know. I have my sister but you know girls 
and especially with you. What's about me? So  

359
01:07:34.125 --> 01:07:42.291
you know I don't know if that's the right time 
to say but we're living in really strange times

360
01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:52.833
I have some feelings that I haven't felt for years 
and they feel so fresh and new and encouraging and  

361
01:07:53.625 --> 01:07:59.000
you know I actually think that

362
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:05.375
I fell in love.
with you

363
01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:20.541
I think. I feel the same

364
01:09:56.916 --> 01:10:04.625
I know it will be hard but it's Jesus in 
the center of our relationship it can last.  

365
01:10:04.625 --> 01:10:15.958
It will last if we put him first.  
But I have to go. I have to go to work.

366
01:10:16.625 --> 01:10:22.833
All right take care and when you're back 
I will have a little surprise for you.

367
01:10:48.833 --> 01:10:54.458
Can you come for a second I got something really 
beautiful I think that would fit Holly perfectly

368
01:10:56.625 --> 01:10:57.958
Oh she will love that  

369
01:11:04.041 --> 01:11:05.250
Holly could you come please?

370
01:11:10.458 --> 01:11:13.500
Hey look at this. we think you might like this.  

371
01:11:14.125 --> 01:11:25.958
Wow that's beautiful! Right isn't it? Do 
you want me to put it on for you? Oh yes

372
01:11:31.333 --> 01:11:39.958
uh

373
01:12:25.416 --> 01:12:29.416
What are you doing? Follow me come on!

374
01:12:35.583 --> 01:12:36.833
What did you do in there?

375
01:12:39.333 --> 01:12:46.541
I was. I was looking through. I was looking 
through the papers. I was looking for. I mean  

376
01:12:47.875 --> 01:12:54.666
I'm sorry. Did you want to destroy files?
Are you a supporter of the Traitors?  

377
01:12:55.416 --> 01:12:59.791
That is high treason. you know that you 
can die for that and you will die for that.

378
01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:06.541
Yes I'm ready to die if necessary.

379
01:13:06.541 --> 01:13:12.833
because because I don't fight for my own sake 
I'm fighting for something bigger than us

380
01:13:15.708 --> 01:13:19.583
You know what. I appreciate what you did. You do?

381
01:13:22.291 --> 01:13:25.875
You know when I was a kid my dad 
tried to make a machine out of me  

382
01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:32.375
he trained me to be brutal. fearless and 
hateful and loyal towards his mindset and  

383
01:13:32.375 --> 01:13:38.750
now also to the constitution the more effort he 
put into it. the more I started to hate my life  

384
01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:43.958
and the things he stands for. The problem 
is his brutality. he often mentioned that  

385
01:13:43.958 --> 01:13:49.000
he would execute everyone who's not loyal 
to the constitution even me and my mom.  

386
01:13:49.958 --> 01:13:57.416
I'm so sorry to hear that. It's okay I hate what 
I do every time I walk into that building I try  

387
01:13:57.416 --> 01:14:04.625
to put a poker face on. The more I gain my dad's 
trust the more lives I could save. What do you mean?

388
01:14:05.875 --> 01:14:11.791
I'm a murderer but after time I was able 
to secretly warn or make the targets escape.  

389
01:14:12.666 --> 01:14:17.083
My father trusts me that's why it 
became possible after much bloodshed.  

390
01:14:18.125 --> 01:14:25.166
Do you want to change your life because we 
have something big coming up. I think I can't  

391
01:14:25.791 --> 01:14:33.458
when others are around. there's so much pressure 
on me and then I'm just following my orders

392
01:15:15.875 --> 01:15:21.250
Okay Holly is everything set up do we have a safe 
connection? Yes I created an online room for us  

393
01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:27.333
all that is safe and I will constantly check 
the connection. Guys i'm so excited that so many  

394
01:15:27.333 --> 01:15:34.458
people are actually showing up and taking part 
in our communion. This really reminds me of the  

395
01:15:34.458 --> 01:15:39.250
good times right. Yeah. where we get you know 
every week we have Bible studies hanging out  

396
01:15:39.250 --> 01:15:47.500
with friends going to church. yeah absolutely. 
All right let's start a stream three two one

397
01:15:50.291 --> 01:15:56.666
Okay. so first of all I want to thank you all so 
much for joining this communion this shows how  

398
01:15:56.666 --> 01:16:03.500
bold you are and that gives hope that we will 
start a new time. a time of faith. love and joy  

399
01:16:04.208 --> 01:16:10.458
and even if it will be hard for us in this 
world but you know Jesus didn't say that  

400
01:16:10.458 --> 01:16:17.166
following him will be easy. and let us 
encourage each other that through him  

401
01:16:17.791 --> 01:16:22.833
through Jesus we will get through this hard 
time and then you know at the end we will  

402
01:16:22.833 --> 01:16:29.000
be lifted up and will be given our reward for 
what we've done here. So as soon as you're ready  

403
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:35.708
we're going to start the communion. You can 
go to your Bibles on first corinthians 11.24

404
01:16:42.291 --> 01:16:50.208
On the night in which Jesus was betrayed he took 
the bread when he had given thanks he broke it  

405
01:16:50.208 --> 01:17:01.958
and said. take and eat this is my body which 
is broken for you do this in remembrance of me

406
01:17:25.958 --> 01:17:29.958
He also took the cup after his supper.  

407
01:17:31.708 --> 01:17:41.166
and he said. this cup is a new covenant in 
my blood. do this as often as you drink it

408
01:17:43.583 --> 01:17:46.291
in remembrance of me let's drink

409
01:17:56.916 --> 01:17:58.291
Hunter would you maybe pray for us

410
01:18:02.916 --> 01:18:06.375
Dear heavenly father. lord thank you for 
this day that you've given us to be able to  

411
01:18:06.916 --> 01:18:12.833
broadcast your your love and and your word lord  

412
01:18:14.375 --> 01:18:19.583
well it's not every day we have this chance to do 
this to come together lord whether it be in person  

413
01:18:19.583 --> 01:18:28.833
or online but lord we appreciate every time 
we have together in fellowship and lord we want  

414
01:18:28.833 --> 01:18:36.208
to expand your kingdom lord. so give us the tools 
to do so lord our times are hard now harder than  

415
01:18:36.208 --> 01:18:44.625
ever but there's no doubt that you're still by our 
side. every day lord you're with us you guide us

416
01:18:46.833 --> 01:18:49.500
you're the light at our feet lord lent to our path  

417
01:18:50.833 --> 01:18:53.958
thank you for everything you give us 
every single day lord little or small  

418
01:18:54.916 --> 01:18:58.458
or we may not know everything and you may 
not show us everything but it's for a reason

419
01:19:01.166 --> 01:19:08.208
lord just protect us and let your will be 
done lord on earth as it is in heaven amen  

420
01:19:08.208 --> 01:19:15.875
amen. Thanks hunter. what encouraging words of 
course. So I want to thank you all for taking  

421
01:19:15.875 --> 01:19:22.208
part of this communion today it shows me that even 
if the world is against us. our God is for us and  

422
01:19:22.208 --> 01:19:29.625
if our god is for us. who can be against us. They 
may take our house our job maybe even our lives  

423
01:19:30.458 --> 01:19:37.625
but what they cannot take from us is a 
joy and a love and a faith in God. Remember  

424
01:19:37.625 --> 01:19:41.875
when the world is against us. God 
has already overcome the world. 

425
01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:53.625
Hope you all have a good evening. thanks for 
joining! Bye. Oh man that was so great I enjoyed  

426
01:19:53.625 --> 01:20:03.958
that so many people people right. That was so big! 
Incredible the whole world was watching wow yes

427
01:20:23.791 --> 01:20:26.541
No sir we don't have anything. I have no evidence  

428
01:20:28.208 --> 01:20:36.375
No. this group is tight they 
have no weaknesses. I know

429
01:20:40.916 --> 01:20:41.916
look at that

430
01:20:44.125 --> 01:20:48.041
Sir please come. wait I'll call you right back

431
01:20:55.583 --> 01:20:56.458
Who do we have here

432
01:20:58.625 --> 01:21:03.250
So it's good to see you sir. my name is luc 
and I got some interesting information for you.

433
01:21:04.125 --> 01:21:07.500
Go ahead let me hear it. So I 
heard you're looking for the  

434
01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:13.958
christian group. underground group. that is kind 
of dancing on your noses. I was one of them but  

435
01:21:15.416 --> 01:21:21.083
But if you give me something in reverse I got 
some information for you. I'm listening. I want  

436
01:21:21.083 --> 01:21:28.458
immunity. I can grant it. Nice. so here's the 
cool thing they are like only three people  

437
01:21:28.458 --> 01:21:34.916
and this whole thing is just growing out of itself. 
It is weird but they got one hacker that is  

438
01:21:35.583 --> 01:21:42.291
deleting all their tracks in your system so 
they can coordinate everything over the phones  

439
01:21:42.291 --> 01:21:46.750
but you cannot find it. I can show you where they 
have their headquarters. It's an abandoned house  

440
01:21:46.750 --> 01:21:55.958
nobody sees that there's anything. How far from 
here? 25 kilometers. I can show you. Let's go

441
01:23:00.375 --> 01:23:03.000
clear

442
01:23:23.250 --> 01:23:26.291
They're running up there

443
01:25:15.791 --> 01:25:22.166
You see how many they took from 
us. or this one

444
01:25:31.041 --> 01:25:33.208
They took that right

445
01:25:36.041 --> 01:25:40.875
Execute him. dispose him discreetly

446
01:25:42.541 --> 01:25:46.583
He's finished
