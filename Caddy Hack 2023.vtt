Willy. the voice of

The Old's Golf Club Radio.

33
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.486
Yes. it's a beautiful day.

34
00:02:28.488 --> 00:02:31.218
but it's gonna be a tee-riffic weekend

35
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.018
at the Complete and Putter
Madness Golf Tournament.

36
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.094
No. if. and-

37
00:02:35.096 --> 00:02:37.846
(Landon yelling)

38
00:02:39.717 --> 00:02:42.224
- Turn that off!
- What?

39
00:02:42.226 --> 00:02:44.428
- Turn that fucking thing off!

40
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.448
- I can't understand you.

41
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.150
Let me try and cut this thing off.

42
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.653
- Why doesn't he just move?

43
00:02:50.801 --> 00:02:52.190
- No. stop.

44
00:02:52.192 --> 00:02:53.909
- Sorry about that.

45
00:02:53.911 --> 00:02:56.299
- Turn that fucking thing off.

46
00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:57.951
- Sometimes these old things get stuck.

47
00:02:57.953 --> 00:03:00.290
Usually not a problem.

48
00:03:00.292 --> 00:03:02.881
usually not pointing
right in someones face.

49
00:03:02.883 --> 00:03:05.703
- Just turn that fucking thing off.

50
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.048
I just- (man yells)

51
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.973
- Sorry.
Sorry about that.

52
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.643
Don't touch me with
your retarded jizz rag.

53
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.898
As I was saying. I just came down to say

54
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.348
what an amazing job you're
doing with the course.

55
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.089
- Well. thanks Mr. Landon.

56
00:03:30.091 --> 00:03:32.668
I've been trying really hard for you.

57
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.638
- This weekend is a very
important weekend for me

58
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.988
and the club. and I couldn't
be happier with the greens.

59
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.198
You may be one of the biggest
pieces of worthless shit

60
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.818
I've ever laid eyes on.

61
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.878
but Goddamn. you can take care of grass.

62
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.470
- It's all thanks to
my special fertilizer.

63
00:03:51.472 --> 00:03:53.223
it's my own secret recipe.

64
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.503
- That fertilizer?

65
00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.378
That I just drank a half a gallon of?

66
00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.518
- The very same.

67
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.723
- What's in that stuff?

68
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
- Nitrogen. potassium. phosphorus.

69
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.438
which aids in photosynthesis.

70
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.271
- Of course.

71
00:04:11.273 --> 00:04:14.728
- Micronutrients. dechlorinate acid.

72
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.898
tetracycline acid. bleach. ammonia.

73
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.353
And of course my secret family additives.

74
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.828
- Which are?

75
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.233
- Well. sir. if I told you that.

76
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.623
with all due respect I'd have to kill you.

77
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.943
- Yes.

78
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.589
And this is safe for people?

79
00:04:38.591 --> 00:04:39.841
- I mean. sure.

80
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.703
I huff it all the time and I'm fine.

81
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.458
- Yeah.

82
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.723
What about the animals?

83
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.628
- I haven't seen them huffing it.

84
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.003
- No. you boob. is it safe for them?

85
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.253
- Probably not.

86
00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.898
- Oh well. fuck 'em. (laughs)

87
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.418
They don't pay any dues
on the greens anyway.

88
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.548
As long as my big money friends are safe

89
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.398
to knock around some balls.
that's all I care about.

90
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.079
(both laughing)

91
00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:13.748
(siren blaring)

92
00:05:16.862 --> 00:05:17.695
- Oh no.

93
00:05:19.072 --> 00:05:20.488
Oh no.

94
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:21.753
Not on my good weekend.

95
00:05:28.607 --> 00:05:31.190
(upbeat music)

96
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.258
- What you doing. Googie?

97
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.361
- Reading.

98
00:05:41.363 --> 00:05:42.194
- Reading?

99
00:05:42.196 --> 00:05:43.622
- What the hell are you reading for?

100
00:05:43.624 --> 00:05:45.118
- Yeah. why you reading?

101
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.091
Trying to transform words
into pictures in your brain?

102
00:05:48.093 --> 00:05:50.728
- I don't know.
I just like reading.

103
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:51.688
- You like reading.

104
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.548
- Oh. you like reading. huh?

105
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:54.381
- Yeah.

106
00:05:54.383 --> 00:05:55.768
- Well. we got something for you to read.

107
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.688
- Yeah. read this.

108
00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.058
It's called You. Me and Everyone.

109
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.688
Making life better for your
friends. family and the world.

110
00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.968
I think it may help you with
some of the social anxiety

111
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.768
you seem to exude here at the club.

112
00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:08.938
- Changed my life.

113
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.848
I think I'd still be in
the closet without this.

114
00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.108
- You're gay. Smitty?

115
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.278
- Oh. I wish.

116
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.748
I was actually trapped in the closet.

117
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.098
Luckily I found this book.

118
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.048
grabbed it and whacked away at the door

119
00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.488
until the handle fell off.

120
00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:21.363
Saved my life.

121
00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:25.719
(man panting)

122
00:06:31.811 --> 00:06:34.768
(cat screeches)

123
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:35.920
- What is it. hole boy?

124
00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.513
- Something happened on hole 15?

125
00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.014
- It's Gordy?

126
00:06:43.016 --> 00:06:44.466
What. what happened to Gordy?

127
00:06:47.296 --> 00:06:48.846
- You're shitting me. hole boy.

128
00:06:56.851 --> 00:06:59.601
(hole boy farts)

129
00:07:07.786 --> 00:07:10.203
(indistinct)

130
00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.518
- For the love of all
that's worth my time.

131
00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.718
what happened here?

132
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.038
- Looks like one of your employees

133
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.658
didn't make it home last night-

134
00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.818
- I don't care about him.

135
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.913
What happened to my
beautiful landscaping here?

136
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:32.158
I have the biggest tournament
of the season this weekend.

137
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.833
and you are putting
chalk lines on my greens.

138
00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.128
- Sir. please listen to me.

139
00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:39.423
My hat says police.

140
00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:42.658
Sir.

141
00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:43.491
Sir.

142
00:07:43.493 --> 00:07:46.263
I'm gonna need you to stop
contaminating my crime scene.

143
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:49.738
- Your crime scene?

144
00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.778
- That's what I said.
- You're crime scene?

145
00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.028
What about my golf course?

146
00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.968
I can't have my members
playing through a dead caddy.

147
00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.968
Do you know what will happen
if my members see this?

148
00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:02.068
You think they wanna
think about death here

149
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:04.168
at the Old Glory Holes Golf Club?

150
00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:06.058
No. they don't.

151
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.618
If they wanted to think about death

152
00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.168
they'd stay at home with their wives.

153
00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.958
They come here to forget about death.

154
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.460
- Well. we at least have
to wait for an ambulance.

155
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.118
- The ambulance?

156
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.698
You wanna drive an
ambulance on my golf course?

157
00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:21.858
- That's what I said. didn't I?

158
00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.548
- On my greens?

159
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:26.908
Two days before the
biggest event of the year?

160
00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:30.208
Do you know what type of
money plays through here?

161
00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.373
Policeman's ball money.

162
00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:36.178
killed an unarmed 10 year old kid.

163
00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.758
need to not go to jail money.

164
00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.003
- How would you like us
to get rid of the body?

165
00:08:44.088 --> 00:08:46.888
- This is why I have money

166
00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:49.113
and you're just some golf pig.

167
00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:53.038
I have ideas. thoughts.

168
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.598
The best thoughts.

169
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.058
If you had half the
thoughts I had in one night.

170
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:00.868
you'd be. well. you wouldn't
be right here right now.

171
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:01.833
Watch and learn.

172
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:06.243
Watch and learn. stupid.

173
00:09:07.992 --> 00:09:10.659
(playful music)

174
00:09:14.547 --> 00:09:17.297
(body crunching)

175
00:09:55.272 --> 00:09:56.653
(man farts)

176
00:09:56.655 --> 00:09:59.322
(camera clicks)

177
00:10:00.296 --> 00:10:03.431
- Ugh. gross.
You liquified him.

178
00:10:03.433 --> 00:10:06.266
(body squelching)

179
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.823
- You want the real stuff? Right here.

180
00:10:24.825 --> 00:10:27.408
(somber music)

181
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.548
- Take your place upon the wall

182
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:38.008
of heroes that have fallen before you.

183
00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:41.163
Sleep now. you prince amongst princes.

184
00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:46.168
You tiptoed your way into our lives.

185
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:48.333
but only for a moment you stayed.

186
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.468
Oh. but what an imprint your footsteps

187
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:54.153
have had upon our hearts.

188
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.728
- I'm gonna miss that guy.

189
00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.018
He had the cleanest balls

190
00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:00.898
of all the ball cleaners of the club.

191
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.668
- He had the cleanest balls ever.

192
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.918
- His balls were spectacular.

193
00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.088
The shine.

194
00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:07.828
- The whitest.

195
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:08.763
- The shine.

196
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:14.008
- If I had to have the
balls of any of us caddies.

197
00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:15.688
and I know you guys would say the same

198
00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:20.008
without shame or envy. I'd
want to have his balls.

199
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:21.670
- Staring into his balls

200
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.618
was like staring into the balls of God.

201
00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:26.653
- No one...

202
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:33.140
No one could do to balls
what he did to balls.

203
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.798
- The stroking.

204
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.508
- The rubbing.

205
00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:38.908
- The right amount of pressure.

206
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:41.248
- You would just take his fingertips.

207
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:43.233
starting at the base of the ball.

208
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.593
working his way round the ball.

209
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.873
draining the balls holes
of dirt. and debris.

210
00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:55.879
(man grunting)

211
00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:12.448
Damn. hole boy.

212
00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:14.998
You said what we were all thinking.

213
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.428
You motherfucker.

214
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:20.583
Goddamn. now I know this
mother is gonna rest in peace.

215
00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.468
Now let's get out there

216
00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:28.443
and do the best damn
caddying we've ever done.

217
00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.018
And let's do it for Gordy!

218
00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.223
- For Gordy!

219
00:12:32.225 --> 00:12:33.725
- [All] For Gordy!

220
00:12:36.957 --> 00:12:39.624
(ominous music)

221
00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:48.063
- When my father handed
this golf club down to me.

222
00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.328
he put a lot into my little hands.

223
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.573
He ran this golf club for 35 years.

224
00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.828
grew it from a pitching putt

225
00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:01.503
to the greatest golf club
in the tri-state area.

226
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.588
Now it's my turn to take the wheel.

227
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:07.258
make it even bigger and better.

228
00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.568
My first year I started the

229
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:12.460
Complete and Putter
Madness Golf Tournament

230
00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.263
and I've been running
it for four years now.

231
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:23.240
It's been the biggest. the
biggest golf tournament.

232
00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:26.350
this club. this country

233
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.323
and from what I hear.
this world has ever seen.

234
00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:37.258
I have a lot to worry about
leading up to the tournament.

235
00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:41.013
Now I have to deal with
dead caddies on my green.

236
00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:43.888
I can't have this.

237
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:47.518
Everybody knows I'm the
best golf club owner.

238
00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.613
the very best golf club owner.

239
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:57.393
I give my members what they need.

240
00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.638
You know what happens if I stop

241
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.290
giving my members what they need?

242
00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:08.807
I stop getting what I want.

243
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:12.783
I stop getting the money.

244
00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:14.943
the power.

245
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.903
the ego fulfillment.

246
00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:22.790
Is that what you want?

247
00:14:22.792 --> 00:14:25.143
- I'm just a groundskeeper.

248
00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:27.653
- No.

249
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:32.103
Actually. that's not what any of us want.

250
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:39.213
If I lose my power. we all lose our power.

251
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:41.133
You understand?

252
00:14:42.003 --> 00:14:44.433
- No. not really.

253
00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:47.188
- I understand. sir.

254
00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:50.029
- I can't have these
caddies ruining my big day.

255
00:14:50.031 --> 00:14:51.213
- No. No.

256
00:14:52.272 --> 00:14:54.178
They're wild.

257
00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:58.863
They're out there screaming
and yelling. well dying.

258
00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:04.978
These are not the things
that you or your member.

259
00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:07.623
members should have to deal with.

260
00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:09.323
No. no. no.

261
00:15:10.419 --> 00:15:14.668
You've done all you can to
prevent this type of situation.

262
00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:16.174
Yes. yes.

263
00:15:16.176 --> 00:15:18.028
You just relax.

264
00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:20.908
Let me. Miss Flannager.

265
00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:25.910
your best friend and personal
assistant take care of it.

266
00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:32.420
Why. a man of your stature
(giggles) should not have to deal

267
00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:35.668
with this type of situation.

268
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:39.963
with skin so soft and
smelling of fresh linen.

269
00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:45.663
Yes. and the shoulders of a
strong. independent woman.

270
00:15:46.671 --> 00:15:49.195
I don't need no man!

271
00:15:49.197 --> 00:15:51.898
- Jesus Christ with a
boner on the jew cross.

272
00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:53.043
Get away from me!

273
00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:56.673
- Can I go?

274
00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:04.820
- My answer to this problem
is a new caddy manager.

275
00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:10.078
someone who won't take any cuff
from those little shitheads.

276
00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.628
And there's only one person I know

277
00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:14.193
that can handle this mission.

278
00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:18.213
My niece Becky.

279
00:16:20.823 --> 00:16:23.406
(sultry music)

280
00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:41.253
She knows nothing about golf.

281
00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:46.410
Or the day-to-day
operations of being a caddy.

282
00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:49.533
But she's family.

283
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.793
I see no better person for the job.

284
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:57.199
You're gonna spy for me.

285
00:16:57.201 --> 00:16:59.553
I mean. you're gonna manage for me.

286
00:17:01.833 --> 00:17:05.370
Oh. manage them real good for me.

287
00:17:05.372 --> 00:17:07.905
Solve all my problems.

288
00:17:07.907 --> 00:17:10.953
You're so sexy and beautiful.

289
00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:16.563
No man cannot listen to. respect you.

290
00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:20.818
Is she the most beautiful female specimen

291
00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:22.498
you've ever seen?

292
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:23.998
- Damn fine. sir.

293
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.431
Yes. (giggles)

294
00:17:25.433 --> 00:17:28.678
- If I could still get a male erection.

295
00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.333
you know. I'd have one right now.

296
00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:36.963
Bicycle accident. '84.
hasn't worked since.

297
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:38.968
- Don't worry.

298
00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.608
I'll infiltrate that group
of mindless sperm bags

299
00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:45.298
and turn this whole goddamn
caddy operation around.

300
00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.278
I'm gonna go in there like a wrecking ball

301
00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:51.268
until they all do my bidding one by one.

302
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:52.503
Believe you me.

303
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:54.583
- Oh. I do.

304
00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:58.123
(all laughing)

305
00:18:11.726 --> 00:18:14.309
(upbeat music)

306
00:18:17.487 --> 00:18:22.487
I'm spraying these greens every day.

307
00:18:23.254 --> 00:18:24.671
Gotta keep going.

308
00:18:26.025 --> 00:18:27.753
Can't stop now.

309
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:32.193
This always reminds me of Vietnam!

310
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:39.344
My platoon. they're pinned down.

311
00:18:39.346 --> 00:18:41.248
Pew. pew. pew. pew. pew.

312
00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:43.911
I'll save you. guys.
I'll get you out.

313
00:18:43.913 --> 00:18:46.408
Pew. pew. pew. pew. pew.

314
00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:47.788
They're everywhere.

315
00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:49.833
We got Charlie all over the place.

316
00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:54.568
Oh. we're gonna get out boys.

317
00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:56.578
I'll make sure we get to the chopper.

318
00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:58.948
I make sure. we'll get you there.

319
00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:00.950
Pew. pew. pew. pew. pew.

320
00:19:03.493 --> 00:19:06.160
I'll get the flamethrower ready!

321
00:19:09.577 --> 00:19:10.660
Need the gas!

322
00:19:16.236 --> 00:19:17.069
Oh.

323
00:19:18.148 --> 00:19:19.148
Hello there.

324
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:20.973
How are you?

325
00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:28.270
You're such a cutie.

326
00:19:32.025 --> 00:19:37.025
Oh no!

327
00:19:45.946 --> 00:19:46.779
How is it possible?

328
00:19:48.447 --> 00:19:50.163
No. stop.
Please.

329
00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.403
What the fuck?

330
00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.268
- Remember me? Wacky Willy.

331
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:06.633
We're 20 minutes into the
movie. here's another song.

332
00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:16.133
- No. (indistinct)

333
00:20:19.238 --> 00:20:24.238
- Okay guys. settle down.

334
00:20:27.718 --> 00:20:31.803
Okay guys. I have a pretty
important announcement to make.

335
00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:35.313
So if you could all just settle down.

336
00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:40.913
- My boombox!

337
00:20:43.074 --> 00:20:45.491
(rock music)

338
00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:54.517
Whoa. whoa. time out.

339
00:20:56.428 --> 00:20:57.261
Boobies.

340
00:21:01.918 --> 00:21:02.918
Hubba hubba.

341
00:21:04.182 --> 00:21:05.641
- Okay. fellas.

342
00:21:05.643 --> 00:21:08.818
What are the three ups of caddying?

343
00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:10.472
- [All] Show up.

344
00:21:10.474 --> 00:21:13.173
Sheep up and shut up.

345
00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:17.098
- That's right. very good. very good.

346
00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:21.543
So if you could all just shut
up and please try to keep up.

347
00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:27.628
Yes. well. I have a very
important announcement to make.

348
00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:30.478
Fellas. I'd like you to meet Becky.

349
00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.943
She's our new caddy manager.

350
00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.568
- What? A new manager. gimme a break.

351
00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:40.018
- I'm not gonna let this
beaver boss me around.

352
00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.218
What about Mr. Bobbi?

353
00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.738
He's the best damned caddy
manager I've ever worked with.

354
00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:47.938
- Oh. Mr. Bobbi's been
dead for two years now.

355
00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:50.698
Yes. (giggles)

356
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:53.098
- I thought he was just mad at us.

357
00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:56.013
- We really do have to do
something with that body.

358
00:21:57.330 --> 00:21:59.758
- All right. that's not what's important.

359
00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.218
What's important is there's
a new manager in town

360
00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.168
and things are gonna change.

361
00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:05.698
- Like how?

362
00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:09.688
- Like. like no gum.

363
00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:11.308
You guys can't chew gum.

364
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:12.508
- Nobody's chewing gum.

365
00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:14.938
- Good. we're off to an amazing start.

366
00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.378
You see how great I am?

367
00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:17.733
- You are amazing.

368
00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:19.828
Yes.

369
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:22.228
- Now. which one of you pube holes

370
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:23.398
wants to show me around

371
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.498
and fill me in on your
day to day around here?

372
00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:26.848
- I'll fill you in. baby.

373
00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:27.808
- What's your name?

374
00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:28.933
- Around here...

375
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:31.743
They call me fingers.

376
00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:34.438
- Why do they call you that?

377
00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.843
- Oh. I'm sure you'll find out.

378
00:22:37.685 --> 00:22:38.818
(fingers crunching)

379
00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:41.488
Oh God. my fingering fingers.

380
00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:43.190
- Now they're your broken fingers.

381
00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:46.948
Anyone else wanna be a smart ass?

382
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:50.613
Now I'm gonna ask again.
who wants to show me around?

383
00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.263
You. what's your name?

384
00:22:57.265 --> 00:22:58.702
- Googie.

385
00:22:58.704 --> 00:23:01.378
- Well. Googie. it looks
like you've been elected.

386
00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.018
Now get your bony ass
up and let's do this.

387
00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.788
The rest of you get back to work

388
00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:08.590
doing whatever it is you
pecker pinchers do around here.

389
00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.463
- You're all in trouble now. yes.

390
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:15.453
- Get outta here. Flannager.
you brown nose pug wad.

391
00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:19.066
- Things are gonna change around here.

392
00:23:19.068 --> 00:23:22.348
Yes they are. (giggles)

393
00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:23.684
- Thanks a lot guys.

394
00:23:23.686 --> 00:23:25.622
(caddies laughing)

395
00:23:25.624 --> 00:23:28.118
You suck. bony ass!

396
00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.612
- Who likes reading now?

397
00:23:30.614 --> 00:23:33.197
(upbeat music)

398
00:23:35.776 --> 00:23:38.443
(playful music)

399
00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:45.873
- No.

400
00:23:47.548 --> 00:23:48.693
What are you doing?

401
00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:51.778
Don't even think about it.

402
00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:55.438
You are not going to take that sandwich.

403
00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.830
It's not for you.

404
00:23:57.832 --> 00:23:59.433
It's for the gophers.

405
00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:02.163
He's gonna take the sandwich.

406
00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:05.158
We're going to code red.

407
00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:08.974
Be on alert. I repeat. be on alert.

408
00:24:08.976 --> 00:24:11.637
He's gonna eat it.
He's gonna eat it.

409
00:24:11.639 --> 00:24:13.939
I don't have any more
money for another hogey.

410
00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:17.368
Oh. that's it.

411
00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:20.218
The mission's compromised.
mission's compromised.

412
00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:21.453
Abort. abort.

413
00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.688
Drop the sandwich. son.

414
00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:29.668
You take another bite
and I'll slit your throat

415
00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:31.704
and I'll remove that tasty morsel

416
00:24:31.706 --> 00:24:34.228
from your overstretched stomach.

417
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:35.133
Comprende?

418
00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:38.081
You think I'm playing?

419
00:24:38.083 --> 00:24:40.753
Go ahead. take another bite.

420
00:24:40.755 --> 00:24:42.338
See if I'm playing.

421
00:24:44.794 --> 00:24:46.155
Drop it.

422
00:24:46.157 --> 00:24:46.990
Drop it.

423
00:24:47.837 --> 00:24:48.920
There you go.

424
00:24:49.907 --> 00:24:51.533
Now. get the hell outta here.

425
00:24:51.535 --> 00:24:54.285
(dramatic music)

426
00:25:06.886 --> 00:25:09.553
(gopher crying)

427
00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:12.487
- Mission accomplished.

428
00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:19.768
- So let's just say hypothetically.

429
00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:22.768
I don't know anything about
golf or what a caddy does.

430
00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:24.598
Tell me what you guys do around here.

431
00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.908
- Being a caddy is a very important job.

432
00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:29.098
one that gets overlooked a lot.

433
00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.498
We're a good golfer's number one tool.

434
00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:35.158
We walk the course with
them. we carry their bags.

435
00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.462
- Couldn't they just use
a golf cart for that?

436
00:25:37.464 --> 00:25:40.918
- Could a golf cart calculate
the yardage on the next pin?

437
00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.678
Could it tell 'em what club
to use on the next shot?

438
00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.578
Could a golf cart go ahead
and scout the shot for them?

439
00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:50.398
Could it clean and locate their balls?

440
00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.198
Rake sand traps?

441
00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:56.488
And then there's weather
variables. marking the greens.

442
00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:59.023
more than anything else. we...

443
00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.628
A caddy makes the game
more enjoyable for a golfer

444
00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:07.378
by handling mental tasks.
speeding up the process.

445
00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:08.998
being a support for them.

446
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.063
A caddy is a golfer's
best friend and confidant.

447
00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:14.992
- You're kind of a loser around here.

448
00:26:14.994 --> 00:26:16.255
- I don't think so.

449
00:26:16.257 --> 00:26:18.148
- No. I can tell these things.

450
00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:19.528
I can smell it on you.

451
00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:22.258
Same way a dog can smell
when a woman's on her period.

452
00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:24.208
- Is that a thing?

453
00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:26.728
- Why do you let those guys pick on you?

454
00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:28.316
- I don't know.

455
00:26:28.318 --> 00:26:31.528
I think the guys are pretty cool dudes.

456
00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:34.648
Maybe it's because I'm a
38 year old caddy trainee

457
00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:36.748
and they're all championship caddies.

458
00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:38.518
- Championship caddies?

459
00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.428
- Yeah. there's a special
ranking system for caddies.

460
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:44.368
- Doi! You think I didn't know
about the ranking systems.

461
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:45.201
You think I didn't know

462
00:26:45.203 --> 00:26:47.098
there was different ranks for caddies?

463
00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.418
How could I be the caddy manager

464
00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:49.898
if I don't know this stuff. huh?

465
00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:51.199
- I didn't mean anything by it.

466
00:26:51.201 --> 00:26:52.228
I just thought you wanted to know.

467
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:54.478
- I didn't go to Caddy Management College

468
00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.328
for four years to have
some snot rocket trainee

469
00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:58.935
thinks he knows more than I do.

470
00:26:58.937 --> 00:26:59.768
- Sorry.

471
00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:00.601
- You got that?

472
00:27:00.603 --> 00:27:01.434
- Yeah.

473
00:27:01.436 --> 00:27:02.267
- You got it?

474
00:27:02.269 --> 00:27:03.268
- I said yes.

475
00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:05.188
- You think I didn't go to
caddy management college?

476
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:06.898
Do you think I'm lying about that?

477
00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:09.268
- I didn't even know such a thing existed.

478
00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:11.373
- There is a thing and I went there.

479
00:27:12.618 --> 00:27:13.768
- Okay.

480
00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:15.028
- I did.

481
00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:15.861
- Okay.

482
00:27:15.863 --> 00:27:17.588
- I'm not lying.

483
00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:20.140
- Look. I better go fish
the balls out of the lake.

484
00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:25.888
- Don't blow this. Becky.

485
00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:27.538
I'm not going to.

486
00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.158
He's onto us.

487
00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.058
No. he's not.

488
00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.768
He knows you're a fake.

489
00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:33.058
You're a fake.

490
00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.818
We have to get him on
our side at any cost.

491
00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.233
At any cost.

492
00:27:39.163 --> 00:27:41.830
(playful music)

493
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:48.543
- That's some good gopher bait.

494
00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:57.903
Alright. you son of a
bitch. let's do this.

495
00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:06.170
Now I'm gonna spray you
with some of this stuff

496
00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:09.423
and nothing's gonna happen.

497
00:28:09.425 --> 00:28:11.608
You got nothing.

498
00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:14.193
That other gopher was just a fluke.

499
00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:22.100
My patented fertilizer
does not turn you fuzzy.

500
00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:29.043
adorable creatures into sadistic. mutated.

501
00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:34.348
blood hungry devil gophers.

502
00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:35.583
Do we have an agreement?

503
00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:41.578
Good. once we prove that this formula.

504
00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:45.238
my fertilizer does not do the above.

505
00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:49.588
I will let you go and
we'll forget all about this

506
00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:53.223
and we'll go on with our happy lives.

507
00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:58.593
Here we go.

508
00:29:02.735 --> 00:29:05.652
Oh. just in case this does turn you

509
00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:09.358
into a mutated killing machine...

510
00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.148
Not that it will.
Not that it will.

511
00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:15.628
but just in case. I'm sorry.

512
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:20.630
And please try to remember my compassion.

513
00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:24.298
Thank you.

514
00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.663
Deliver me from thine enemies. oh God.

515
00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:33.063
Defend me from those
that rise up against me.

516
00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:38.547
(fertilizer spraying)

517
00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:44.458
You're okay!

518
00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:45.688
You're okay!

519
00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:48.058
See. it wasn't my formula.

520
00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:49.142
It was...

521
00:29:49.144 --> 00:29:51.841
(ominous music)
(Gopher groaning)

522
00:29:51.843 --> 00:29:52.676
No. wait.

523
00:29:54.124 --> 00:29:55.291
Don't do that.

524
00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:59.779
(Hambone laughs)

525
00:30:01.474 --> 00:30:04.828
You got. you had me.
You had me.

526
00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:08.252
I'll tell you what. you really
know how to pull up a prank.

527
00:30:08.254 --> 00:30:10.837
(man laughing)

528
00:30:13.494 --> 00:30:15.827
Oh shit. you're not kidding.

529
00:30:16.687 --> 00:30:17.914
Oh no.

530
00:30:17.916 --> 00:30:18.749
Oh no.

531
00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:21.513
What have you done. Hambone?

532
00:30:25.185 --> 00:30:26.458
What am I gonna do?

533
00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:28.738
What are you gonna do. Hambone?

534
00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.740
You're always doing something like this.

535
00:30:32.115 --> 00:30:33.538
Who knows how many of these creatures

536
00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:34.990
are out there running around.

537
00:30:37.858 --> 00:30:39.958
Wait. Mr. Landon.

538
00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.060
He'll know what to do.

539
00:30:42.279 --> 00:30:45.279
(creature growling)

540
00:30:56.991 --> 00:30:58.164
- No.

541
00:30:58.166 --> 00:30:59.476
no.

542
00:30:59.478 --> 00:31:00.311
no.

543
00:31:01.403 --> 00:31:03.303
This is unacceptable.

544
00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:08.668
You mean to tell me that if these gophers

545
00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:10.318
ingest your formula.

546
00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.683
they turn into these little
killer freaky gophers.

547
00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:17.073
- That seems to be the case.

548
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:21.268
- And you're saying there
may be more of these

549
00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:24.658
mutated shitbags running around my course.

550
00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:26.698
My course?

551
00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:29.908
- Other than this one.
I've only seen one other.

552
00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:31.855
But it's not a crazy idea to think that

553
00:31:31.857 --> 00:31:33.663
there's more out there.

554
00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:38.613
And we're sure this thing is dangerous?

555
00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:41.523
- One attacked me on the green. sir?

556
00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.398
- But are we certain.

557
00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.595
- I'm 50% certain.

558
00:31:46.597 --> 00:31:49.833
but there's only a 30%
chance that that's right.

559
00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:53.853
- 50% certain?

560
00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:01.678
Well. let's find out just how dangerous

561
00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.753
these little flea bags can be.

562
00:32:04.692 --> 00:32:05.525
Flannager!

563
00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.553
- Yes sir?

564
00:32:08.452 --> 00:32:10.352
- Stick your hand in that gopher trap.

565
00:32:11.305 --> 00:32:14.368
- That trap right there. sir?

566
00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:18.088
- Yes. that trap right there. Flannager.

567
00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:20.398
Well. is it safe. sir?

568
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.318
- Safe?
Of course it's safe.

569
00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:23.668
Would I lie to you?

570
00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:26.488
- Oh. well there was that one time. sir.

571
00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:28.708
- And I found a cream to fix it.

572
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:30.508
No harm. no foul.

573
00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:31.648
- You're right there. sir.

574
00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:33.775
- Of course I am.

575
00:32:33.777 --> 00:32:35.488
Now stick your hand in there.

576
00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:37.263
After we'll go get some mimosas.

577
00:32:48.686 --> 00:32:53.686
(Miss Flannager yelling)
(intense music)

578
00:32:55.227 --> 00:32:58.680
Get that disgusting thing outta here!

579
00:32:58.682 --> 00:32:59.991
Have some coot.

580
00:32:59.993 --> 00:33:00.824
- Sorry. sir.

581
00:33:00.826 --> 00:33:02.909
It's totally my bad. sir.

582
00:33:06.987 --> 00:33:09.981
- I can't let these
gophers ruin my tournament.

583
00:33:09.983 --> 00:33:12.988
There's no way I can refund a hundred

584
00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:17.488
of the richest. mediocre
golfers their entry fees.

585
00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:18.628
I already spent half of it

586
00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:20.973
on underage. wheelchair bound hookers.

587
00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:26.850
This problem has to be solved
before it gets out of hand.

588
00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:38.890
Our mission

589
00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:44.218
is to rally the caddies

590
00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:48.520
and have them round up all
these godforsaken things.

591
00:33:48.522 --> 00:33:51.243
- Should I inform the troops
of the entire situation?

592
00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:53.583
- Hell no.

593
00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:57.508
As far as they know.

594
00:33:57.510 --> 00:34:00.298
they're gonna be collecting your average.

595
00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:05.223
cute and cuddly. fun-loving.
run of the mill gophers.

596
00:34:06.834 --> 00:34:10.018
- Do I have clearance to
use any force necessary?

597
00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:10.953
Deadly force?

598
00:34:11.851 --> 00:34:14.218
- You can bomb every one
of the little bastards

599
00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:15.838
as far as I care.

600
00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.393
As long as this weekend
goes off without a hitch.

601
00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:24.963
- As you know. I am disciplined.

602
00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:29.493
Physically and mentally tough.

603
00:34:30.390 --> 00:34:34.948
trained and proficient in
all of my warrior tasks.

604
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:37.263
I won't let you down. sir.

605
00:34:42.396 --> 00:34:44.146
- God speed. Hambone.

606
00:34:47.784 --> 00:34:48.617
God speed.

607
00:34:50.879 --> 00:34:53.629
(downbeat music)

608
00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.098
- Goddammit.

609
00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:04.315
My old game is off today. Googie.

610
00:35:04.317 --> 00:35:07.198
- You just gotta relax and keep calm.

611
00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.818
You topped that drive

612
00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:12.328
and your game's been preoccupied
for the last three holes.

613
00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:13.588
- I know I topped the drive.

614
00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:17.398
You don't think I know that?
That's not it at all.

615
00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.228
- Just stay in the present.

616
00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:21.028
- What do you think? I'm in 1990.

617
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:24.238
back when I actually enjoyed
some part of my life?

618
00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:27.328
- And don't just focus
on your individual shots.

619
00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:30.478
Focus on the pieces of the shots.

620
00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.728
- Pieces of my shots?

621
00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:35.278
- Now you got a tough
putt here. all right?

622
00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:38.758
So put your head in the
preparation process. all right?

623
00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:42.423
Find a safe target. aim your club face.

624
00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.733
Align your body.

625
00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:47.878
Arm back.

626
00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.438
All right. buddy.

627
00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:50.493
Now let her go.

628
00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:58.803
- Dammit. you never let me down. Googie.

629
00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:02.278
Ah. I guess my head's just all messed up

630
00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.988
'cause this broad is out here.

631
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:04.948
- Excuse me?

632
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:06.628
- What. did you fart?

633
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:09.238
- I find it offensive
that you called me a broad

634
00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:11.098
and you think the mere presence of a woman

635
00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:13.528
would throw off your precious golf game.

636
00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:17.578
- Look. lady. I don't like
women on my course. all right?

637
00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:18.808
So if you're gonna be here.

638
00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:20.968
why don't you go get me
a drink or something.

639
00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:23.338
- I don't think she's
messing up your game.

640
00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:26.368
You just have to relax and stay cool.

641
00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:28.948
She might even be a good luck charm.

642
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:30.718
She's our new caddy manager.

643
00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:33.298
She's been four years at Caddy College.

644
00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.998
She probably knows more
about golf than both of us.

645
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.978
- Caddy College?

646
00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:40.738
What in tarnation is Caddy College.

647
00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:42.928
- You think just because I
don't have a stinky wiener

648
00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:45.898
between my legs that I can't
know anything about golf?

649
00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:48.808
- That's exactly what I'm trying to say.

650
00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:50.968
I mean. we give you women Mondays. right?

651
00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:54.178
Who do you think you are to
weasel your way around here

652
00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:57.598
every other day of the week
trying to ruin our fun?

653
00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.461
I mean. it's cute that you girls try.

654
00:36:59.463 --> 00:37:01.468
- Cute how we try.

655
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:02.668
How we try?

656
00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:03.501
- I don't think he meant-

657
00:37:03.503 --> 00:37:07.498
- I mean that I'm sick and
tired of these chuckleheaded.

658
00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:11.428
broad burden. femaNazis
trying to change everything

659
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:15.358
that we red blooded Americans
have come to know and love.

660
00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:19.108
Now. if you'll excuse me. I
gotta get back to my game.

661
00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:20.308
- I do mind.

662
00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:22.768
And I bet I could hit
one of these ball things

663
00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:24.538
farther than you could.

664
00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:27.058
- You think you could hit
the drive better than me?

665
00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:29.428
- You bet your old wrinkly balls I do.

666
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:31.265
- Becky. I don't know
if this is a good idea.

667
00:37:31.267 --> 00:37:33.117
- I don't have to take this from him.

668
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:35.463
- Feisty this one.

669
00:37:37.759 --> 00:37:38.592
- Psst.

670
00:37:42.556 --> 00:37:43.556
Becky. psst.

671
00:37:45.052 --> 00:37:45.885
Psst.

672
00:37:49.330 --> 00:37:51.358
- Look. I know this guy's an asshole

673
00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:53.728
but he's one of the
wealthiest club members.

674
00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:55.888
We can't afford to piss him off.

675
00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:58.743
but Mr. Landon won't be
pleased if this guy complains.

676
00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:01.866
- Fuck Mr. Landon.

677
00:38:01.868 --> 00:38:04.451
(upbeat music)

678
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:18.603
- You ready out there. Googie?

679
00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:26.043
Let's see you do better than that?

680
00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:37.871
- Dammit.

681
00:38:37.873 --> 00:38:40.708
- (laughs) Oh. what's the matter. girly?

682
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:42.743
Not as good as you thought you were. huh?

683
00:38:44.927 --> 00:38:46.318
- You've got this. Becky.

684
00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.748
Just concentrate on the ball.

685
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:50.193
Be one with the ball.

686
00:38:56.748 --> 00:38:59.373
(Googie groaning)

687
00:38:59.375 --> 00:39:00.778
- Googie.

688
00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:02.398
- Oh. my balls.

689
00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.738
It's okay. nice shot.

690
00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:05.883
- Best out of three.

691
00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:12.693
Best outta five.

692
00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:21.493
- Not again! (groans)

693
00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:31.273
- Best out of 11.

694
00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:38.848
- Nothing like a mid-afternoon brew break.

695
00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:41.698
- Work hard. party hard.
that's what I always say.

696
00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:43.413
- Do you Stan? Do you?

697
00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:47.398
- I say it all the time.

698
00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:50.158
- I haven't heard you say
that once this whole film.

699
00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:51.778
- It's my first scene.

700
00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:53.818
- Any of you guys ever
hear Stanny boy here

701
00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:56.008
say work hard. party hard.

702
00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:56.968
- No.

703
00:39:56.970 --> 00:39:58.228
- What are you saying. Biggles?

704
00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:00.538
Are you saying I can't party hard?

705
00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:02.638
- Yeah. that's exactly
what the Biggles is saying.

706
00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.198
You can't party hard. Stan.

707
00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:08.518
And you certainly can't party
harder than the Biggles.

708
00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:11.338
- I work hard and I party hard

709
00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:14.248
and I can party harder
than every one of you.

710
00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:15.898
- Party harder than all of us?

711
00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:17.968
You gotta be kidding. Stan.

712
00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:19.978
- You gotta be kidding. Stan.

713
00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:22.408
- Shit son. the Biggels was partying hard

714
00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:24.778
when you were still
sucking on your mama's tit.

715
00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:26.477
- Your mom's tit. Stan.

716
00:40:26.479 --> 00:40:28.288
- Leave my mom outta this.

717
00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:29.428
She's dead. you know?

718
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:31.378
- My condolences. Stan.

719
00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:33.088
- You know that's probably
why she laid there

720
00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:37.528
when I was giving her the world
famous Biggle special. Stan.

721
00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:38.818
- The Biggle special. Stan.

722
00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:41.073
- That's it.
That's it. man!

723
00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:44.058
We're gonna settle this like men.

724
00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:48.555
- [All] Party off. party off. party off.

725
00:40:48.557 --> 00:40:50.188
- Quiet. Quiet!

726
00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:53.938
There's no time for a party off right now.

727
00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:57.092
We've got pressing matters to discuss.

728
00:40:57.094 --> 00:40:59.863
- Is there time for a quick dance off?

729
00:40:59.865 --> 00:41:02.532
(playful music)

730
00:41:17.503 --> 00:41:18.334
- Okay.

731
00:41:18.336 --> 00:41:19.167
(caddies cheer)

732
00:41:19.169 --> 00:41:21.216
But make it quick!

733
00:41:21.218 --> 00:41:23.801
(upbeat music)

734
00:42:54.104 --> 00:42:58.378
- So. you and your little gopher buddies

735
00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:00.035
think you can just come in here

736
00:43:00.037 --> 00:43:03.273
and ruin everything I've ever worked for?

737
00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:06.783
Like you own this land or something.

738
00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:12.513
There's plenty of other
places for your kind to go.

739
00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:18.843
When this tournament's over.
I'm gonna build a wall.

740
00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:23.853
The biggest damn wall you
gophers have ever seen.

741
00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:27.388
You're lucky you don't have any money.

742
00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:29.763
I'd make the whole lot of you pay for it.

743
00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:37.858
Then finally. me and my friends.

744
00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:40.690
the good people of the
Old Glory Holes Golf Club

745
00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.583
will be free of nuisances like you.

746
00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:52.893
Yeah. I'd like to see
you get in here then.

747
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:58.182
Nobody gets a drop on Wells Landon.

748
00:43:58.184 --> 00:43:59.278
(cage rattles)

749
00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:00.113
Christ!

750
00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:03.970
Hey. hey. hey.
How you doing?

751
00:44:03.972 --> 00:44:06.478
You know that stuff I was saying.

752
00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:09.628
you don't think I meant any of it. do you?

753
00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:12.943
Hey. we can talk about this.
We can negotiate it.

754
00:44:13.822 --> 00:44:17.072
I got a lot of friends who are gophers.

755
00:44:18.233 --> 00:44:20.103
Some of my best friends are gophers.

756
00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:23.410
I like you guys so much

757
00:44:24.769 --> 00:44:28.473
that I'm gonna let you join my club.

758
00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:35.678
- No. the rich can't die like this.

759
00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:38.662
No!

760
00:44:38.664 --> 00:44:41.581
(gophers growling)

761
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:08.030
- Men. all this stuff
you hear about caddies

762
00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:11.038
not wanting to work and only wanting

763
00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:13.948
to goof off and party hard

764
00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:16.798
is a load of bullocky.

765
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.438
Caddies love to work.

766
00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:23.488
A caddy must be alert at all times

767
00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:27.298
if he expects to keep his job.

768
00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:28.708
- Where are you going with this. Hambone?

769
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:30.164
- Come on. man.

770
00:45:30.166 --> 00:45:32.608
I got a whole speech to do here.

771
00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:35.068
- Make it quick. the
Biggles has partying to do.

772
00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:38.428
There will be no partying
for you boys tonight.

773
00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:42.568
for each caddy must not
think only of himself.

774
00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:44.938
but must think of the golfers

775
00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:48.176
that walk these greens every day.

776
00:45:48.178 --> 00:45:49.018
- What are you telling us. Hambone?

777
00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:50.103
We gotta stay late?

778
00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:53.308
- This is bunk. dog.

779
00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:54.958
- It's not bunk.

780
00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:58.108
And would you guys let
me finish my speech?

781
00:45:58.110 --> 00:46:01.048
I worked really hard on it.

782
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:02.608
- Forget this. I got stuff to do.

783
00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:03.868
- Be seated.

784
00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:04.781
- Oh Jesus.

785
00:46:04.783 --> 00:46:08.068
- Listen up. you no good bitch wipes.

786
00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:10.938
You're all staying and no one's leaving

787
00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:13.173
until your mission is complete.

788
00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:18.658
There comes a point in every caddy's life

789
00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:23.493
when he must decide if
he is a boy or a man.

790
00:46:24.803 --> 00:46:28.678
Sure. we might hate our jobs.

791
00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:33.680
Sure. we might go home
and look in the mirror

792
00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:38.488
and pray to a God we
know isn't even listening

793
00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:42.988
to have just a bit of
mercy and end our lives.

794
00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:45.633
Sure. we may go home.

795
00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:50.458
cover our genitalia in peanut butter

796
00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:55.048
only to remember your dog
died three years prior.

797
00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:56.793
but that is not today.

798
00:46:57.630 --> 00:47:02.630
Today we go out there as boys
and we will return heroes.

799
00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:04.433
- Yeah!

800
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:08.103
- We will return men.

801
00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:14.338
One day when you're sitting
in your favorite chair

802
00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:16.962
and your grandkids ask you

803
00:47:16.964 --> 00:47:20.188
what the greatest day of your life was.

804
00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:21.663
it will be this day.

805
00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:26.098
And they will look at you with pride

806
00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:30.298
spewing out of their eyes like diarrhea.

807
00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:31.863
Like diarrhea!

808
00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:36.748
Now let's get out there and
give them everything we got!

809
00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:38.068
- [All] Yeah!

810
00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:42.568
- Make me proud boys!
Make me proud!

811
00:47:42.570 --> 00:47:43.403
- Yeah!

812
00:47:44.993 --> 00:47:45.977
- [Caddies] Proud. proud.
proud. proud. proud.

813
00:47:47.309 --> 00:47:49.410
Proud. proud. proud. proud. proud.

814
00:47:49.412 --> 00:47:52.475
Proud. proud. proud. proud. proud.

815
00:47:52.477 --> 00:47:55.744
Proud. proud. proud. proud. proud.

816
00:47:55.746 --> 00:47:57.810
Proud. proud. proud. proud. proud.

817
00:47:57.812 --> 00:47:59.093
Proud. proud. proud. proud. proud.

818
00:48:00.042 --> 00:48:04.067
Proud. proud. proud. proud. proud.

819
00:48:16.455 --> 00:48:19.918
- Oh. shit. I forgot to tell
them what they were doing.

820
00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:21.993
Hey guys. guys!

821
00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:33.178
- What's Hambone's damage. man?

822
00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:35.158
He's got us out here like
we're animal control.

823
00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:37.378
I know. right? We should be by the pool

824
00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:39.483
drinking a cold can of...

825
00:48:39.485 --> 00:48:40.468
Booze!

826
00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:41.303
- Hold it!

827
00:48:45.579 --> 00:48:47.948
- It looks like today's my lucky day.

828
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:50.450
(tense music)

829
00:48:53.364 --> 00:48:56.364
(creature laughing)

830
00:48:57.550 --> 00:48:58.633
- Oh my face.

831
00:48:59.730 --> 00:49:00.990
So not cool.

832
00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:03.418
- You stupid fool.

833
00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:06.020
That's what you get for
taking another man's. booze!

834
00:49:09.608 --> 00:49:13.318
(creature laughing)

835
00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:15.508
- I'm really happy you
showed that golfer up.

836
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:19.168
But did you have to go
best of 37 with him?

837
00:49:19.170 --> 00:49:21.670
- I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to hit you in the

838
00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:24.933
down there every time.

839
00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:28.888
- I'm not even sure he was
using regulation balls.

840
00:49:28.890 --> 00:49:30.748
They seemed wide.

841
00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:33.796
You managed to hit me in
the plumbs every time.

842
00:49:33.798 --> 00:49:35.728
But I can't give you all the credit.

843
00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:38.728
It must have gotten
easier as they swelled up.

844
00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:40.078
- You probably didn't even have to be

845
00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:41.518
standing out there to judge.

846
00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:43.198
We could have just walked to the balls.

847
00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:45.213
- Yeah. that's good to know now.

848
00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:48.928
- I had a great time
with you today. Googie.

849
00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:49.763
- Me too.

850
00:49:50.730 --> 00:49:52.498
My sperm holders. not so much.

851
00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:55.858
but I had a really great time.

852
00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:57.028
- I know you had to be forced

853
00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:59.158
into showing me the ropes around here.

854
00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.753
but I'm glad it was you.

855
00:50:03.087 --> 00:50:04.337
- I'm glad it was me too.

856
00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:09.153
- Look. there's something
I have to tell you.

857
00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:12.453
- Is it gonna hurt my feelings?

858
00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:15.208
- Why would you ask that?

859
00:50:15.210 --> 00:50:18.118
- Because no one ever says.
I've got to tell you something

860
00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:20.188
if it's gonna be good news.

861
00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:23.013
- Would it help if I told you in song?

862
00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:25.893
- It might.

863
00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:28.563
- Yo. keyboard guy.

864
00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:32.117
lay me down something noice!

865
00:50:34.036 --> 00:50:36.619

even after we made up that
impromptu song right on the spot.

910

Balls deep. balls deep in love.

911
00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:23.638

912
00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:25.858
Everybody loved Cliff.

913
00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:28.503
Who would do this to poor. sweet Cliff?

914
00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:31.371
- Wassup?

915
00:53:31.373 --> 00:53:33.603

916
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:36.570
Oh. oh my.

917
00:53:36.572 --> 00:53:39.572
(creature laughing)

918
00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:45.328
- I'm done.

919
00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:47.338
And before you tell me
you knew I couldn't do it

920
00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:48.298
because I have a pussy.

921
00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:49.353

- [Gopher] Hambone.

928
00:54:51.977 --> 00:54:54.810
(Hambone yelling)

929
00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:02.717
- You crap folds wanna go to war?

930
00:55:04.164 --> 00:55:06.718
Well. I've been to war

931
00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:08.968
and I don't think you queef wads

932
00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:12.268
would last one day with
the shit I've seen.

933
00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:15.088
You think you're ready
to enter Hambone's world?

934
00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:17.488
You wanna settle this like men

935
00:55:17.490 --> 00:55:20.968
and not like the piss
flaps you know you are.

936
00:55:20.970 --> 00:55:22.070
- [Gopher] Piss flaps.

937
00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:29.188
- The game's called Russian Roulette.

938
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:30.993
It's a game of chance.

939
00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:34.480
It's played with this revolver

940
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:36.838
and this.

941
00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:39.208
a single bullet.

942
00:55:39.210 --> 00:55:41.583
We take this one bad boy.

943
00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:46.473
load it into this death pistol.

944
00:55:48.810 --> 00:55:50.133
spin the cylinder.

945
00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:55.900
put the muzzle to our
head and pull the trigger.

Okay. you cut fucking
clit jackets. back up!

950
00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:57.178
Let me outta here.

951
00:56:57.180 --> 00:57:00.545
Or I swear to God I'll send
his brains all over this-

952
00:57:00.547 --> 00:57:01.824
(gophers growling)

953
00:57:01.826 --> 00:57:04.826

954
00:57:09.617 --> 00:57:11.731
My horoscope was right.

(upbeat music)

956
00:57:16.593 --> 00:57:19.738
I've been wasting my whole night

957
00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:22.348
looking for some freaking gophers.

958
00:57:22.350 --> 00:57:24.208
I couldn't find the damn one of them.

959
00:57:24.210 --> 00:57:27.110
- Well. maybe we would've if
we left the shack and looked.

960
00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:30.783
- Man. I'd rather be out
there hunting beaver.

961
00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:35.488
- Oh. speaking of beaver.

962
00:57:35.490 --> 00:57:37.138
- There's no time for jokes.

963
00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:39.448
We have a major crisis on our hands.

964
00:57:39.450 --> 00:57:40.558
It's the gophers.

965
00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:42.358
These things have mutated.

966
00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:44.428
while you're in here
drinking your life away

967
00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:46.468
the other caddies are
out there being killed.

968
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:49.413
- Nice try tuts. like
we're gonna fall for that.

969
00:57:50.281 --> 00:57:54.838
- Guys. we have a major
crisis on our hands.

970
00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:56.278
It's the gophers.

971
00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:59.523
They've mutated and they're
out there killing everyone.

972
00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:01.413
- I don't know. yo.

973
00:58:03.450 --> 00:58:06.598
A woman and a nerd?

974
00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:10.738
I probably need one more side of this

975
00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:13.828
to be fully committed to the idea

976
00:58:13.830 --> 00:58:16.798
that there are mutated gophers

977
00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:19.043
running around killing suckers.

978
00:58:19.045 --> 00:58:21.712
(door creaking)

979
00:58:25.029 --> 00:58:27.946
(Hambone grunting)

980
00:58:57.646 --> 00:58:58.729
- Maybe I can

981
00:59:05.339 --> 00:59:06.172
be of

982
00:59:08.091 --> 00:59:08.924
some

983
00:59:12.635 --> 00:59:13.552
assistance.

984
00:59:17.248 --> 00:59:18.665
Glad I didn't die

985
00:59:32.403 --> 00:59:37.403
so I could crawl here

986
00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:45.083
and confirm this woman
and this nerd's story.

987
00:59:56.670 --> 00:59:58.323
911 was an inside job.

988
00:59:59.351 --> 01:00:02.458
(Hambone farts)

989
01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:03.958
- This is rectum shit.

990
01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:05.608
If there's mutated gophers out there.

991
01:00:05.610 --> 01:00:07.466
I got something they can eat right here.

992
01:00:07.468 --> 01:00:12.468
(rock music)
(group yelling)

993
01:00:17.422 --> 01:00:19.108
- [Radio Host] This is a
special request coming out

994
01:00:19.110 --> 01:00:22.738
to the cats over at the
Old Glory Olds Golf Club.

995
01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:24.457

996
01:00:24.459 --> 01:00:26.876

serious dick after this tonight

1034
01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:10.190
and you're gonna give it to me.

1035
01:03:15.289 --> 01:03:18.789

1036
01:03:23.363 --> 01:03:27.113

1040
01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:55.963
- Yass. queen. I'm your hole in one.

1041
01:03:57.885 --> 01:04:00.552
(gopher laughs)

1042
01:04:04.039 --> 01:04:05.539

(upbeat music)

1047
01:04:46.329 --> 01:04:51.251
- We outta beer. we gonna have
to do something about that.

1048
01:04:51.253 --> 01:04:53.020
- It's dreadful. but I've got an idea.

1049
01:04:53.022 --> 01:04:56.299
Let's go.

1050
01:04:56.301 --> 01:04:58.968
(playful music)

1051
01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:08.235
(tense music)

1052
01:05:34.936 --> 01:05:39.873
- [Gopher] He might be on to us.

1053
01:05:39.875 --> 01:05:42.875
(car alarm blaring)

1054
01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:10.288
- These tip plugs took over our shack.

1055
01:06:10.290 --> 01:06:11.368
We have to get them.

1056
01:06:11.370 --> 01:06:13.726
- There's just too many of them.

1057
01:06:13.728 --> 01:06:16.514
I think I know someone
who can help us out.

1058
01:06:16.516 --> 01:06:18.933
(rock music)

1059
01:06:23.430 --> 01:06:27.748
So this is my brother's
room. he's a loser.

1060
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:31.048
He's pretty much in
there all day. all night

1061
01:06:31.050 --> 01:06:33.688
writing his blog about making bombs

1062
01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:35.043
and blowing up his school.

1063
01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:38.553
He's a real lost cause.

1064
01:06:39.810 --> 01:06:41.908
He's not as cool as us.

1065
01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:43.623
He's probably still a virgin.

1066
01:06:44.490 --> 01:06:46.438
- That sounds like a good setup to a joke

1067
01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:47.790
that's gonna come later on.

1068
01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:50.188
- He's probably masturbating

1069
01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:52.203
to the videos of the Columbine massacre.

1070
01:06:53.175 --> 01:06:56.092
(knocking on door)

1071
01:06:58.647 --> 01:07:01.648
- What do you want. we're
doing stuff in here.

1072
01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:04.350

1073
01:07:06.136 --> 01:07:09.088
- My help.
You want my help?

1074
01:07:09.090 --> 01:07:10.978
For over 13 years. I've been oppressed

1075
01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:12.898
and you want my help?

1076
01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:14.128
It's funny how a person tries

1077
01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:15.838
to live life and is chastised.

1078
01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:17.431
but if they're helpful to your cause-

1079
01:07:17.433 --> 01:07:20.578
- Look. I've read your blog about how

1080
01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:21.808
you wanna blow up your school.

1081
01:07:21.810 --> 01:07:23.073
- You've read my blog?

1082
01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:24.741
- Yes.

1083
01:07:24.743 --> 01:07:26.458
And it seems like you have an idea

1084
01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:28.708
on how to make homemade bombs. so...

1085
01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:30.238
- You read my blog?

1086
01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:31.933
- Dammit. Barry. you freak...

1087
01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:35.638
Freaking awesome brother. yes!

1088
01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:40.041
So. you gonna show us how to
make homemade bombs or not?

1089
01:07:40.043 --> 01:07:41.324
- Okay. time to go.

1090
01:07:41.326 --> 01:07:43.909
(upbeat music)

1091
01:07:59.873 --> 01:08:01.855
- So what are we blowing up?

1092
01:08:01.857 --> 01:08:04.857
(upbeat rock music)

1093
01:08:16.396 --> 01:08:17.227
(gun fires)

1094
01:08:17.229 --> 01:08:19.048
- We'll never kill these scum wads.

1095
01:08:19.050 --> 01:08:21.163
We gotta rethink this.

1096
01:08:21.165 --> 01:08:23.661
Wait. I have an idea.

1097
01:08:23.663 --> 01:08:26.663
(upbeat rock music)

1098
01:08:32.351 --> 01:08:33.684

- I planted out all the bombs.

1104
01:09:52.214 --> 01:09:55.258
Now all I have to do is
activate this last one

1105
01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:56.583
