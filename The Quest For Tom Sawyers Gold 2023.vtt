"There comes a time
in every rightly-constructed
child's life

4
00:01:16.206 --> 00:01:20.645
when they have
a fervent desire
to go somewhere

5
00:01:20.776 --> 00:01:23.039
<i>and dig for hidden treasure."</i>

6
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.258
There it is.

7
00:01:26.477 --> 00:01:29.132
Okay.
so what's the plan now?

8
00:01:29.263 --> 00:01:31.047
What does the line
at the end of the book say?

9
00:01:31.178 --> 00:01:34.311
"The Widow Douglas invests
in the gold which Tom
and Huck found."

10
00:01:34.442 --> 00:01:35.747
So where'd they find it?

11
00:01:35.878 --> 00:01:38.315
McDougal's Cave.
It's like a mile from the river.

12
00:01:38.446 --> 00:01:41.188
Guys. that was great.
That will make
for a perfect intro.

13
00:01:41.318 --> 00:01:44.234
Let's go again.
Guys. Guys!

14
00:01:44.365 --> 00:01:47.150
<i>"Sometimes the legend
of some riches comes</i>

15
00:01:47.281 --> 00:01:50.327
so heavily wrapped
in folklore

16
00:01:50.458 --> 00:01:55.071
that you gotta scrape away
the edges to work out
what's honest to goodness

17
00:01:55.811 --> 00:01:57.769
and what's hogwash."

18
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.164
<i>Many o' folk
have gone searchin'
for Tom Sawyer's gold before.</i>

19
00:02:01.295 --> 00:02:06.213
<i>but most all have lacked
the wit to match ol' Tom
and Mr. Twain.</i>

20
00:02:06.343 --> 00:02:08.302
Yeah. maybe Woody's right.

21
00:02:08.432 --> 00:02:10.391
We should go away
and think up a plan.

22
00:02:10.521 --> 00:02:13.742
Yeah. like really put a good
week's worth into planning it.

23
00:02:13.872 --> 00:02:14.960
All right.

24
00:02:22.968 --> 00:02:24.056
Please tell me that
was your stomach.

25
00:02:24.187 --> 00:02:25.667
I was hoping
it was yours.

26
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.282
When I get to three.
run into the cave.
One. two...

27
00:02:32.413 --> 00:02:34.154
- Three!

28
00:02:34.284 --> 00:02:35.807
- Woody!

29
00:02:37.026 --> 00:02:39.724
This gold ol'
Tom Sawyer found.

30
00:02:39.855 --> 00:02:41.944
pirate gold it was.

31
00:02:43.032 --> 00:02:45.774
And which Mr. Twain
scribbled down about.

32
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.734
Well. that treasure's
as real as the day is long.

33
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.523
Now. what fills me
with such earthly
confidence in the matter?

34
00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.442
Simple. 'cause my great-grandpa
helped him hide it.

35
00:04:17.692 --> 00:04:19.607
<i>These folks
who go searching.</i>

36
00:04:19.737 --> 00:04:24.133
<i>well. the good ones
find reward enough
in the journey itself.</i>

37
00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:26.744
<i>but there was one
who came close.</i>

38
00:04:30.008 --> 00:04:32.924
Oh!

39
00:04:33.055 --> 00:04:36.972
<i>Now. if you can believe it.

Right there.

The reptilian carnivore

00:05:05.653 --> 00:05:06.828

00:05:07.829 --> 00:05:09.396
the American alligator.

49
00:05:13.791 --> 00:05:15.184
Okay.

50
00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.404
Couldn't have
bothered you anymore.

51
00:05:19.971 --> 00:05:21.538
Oh. God. Go away! Go away!

52
00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:25.455
Hey. snappy! How about you pick
on someone your own size?

53
00:05:28.893 --> 00:05:31.243
- Ow!

54
00:05:33.463 --> 00:05:34.856
Get out of here. darling.

55
00:05:34.986 --> 00:05:38.120
-  Ha-ha!

56
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.949
How do you like that.
you scallywag!

57
00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:42.603
Picking on a little girl.

58
00:05:42.733 --> 00:05:45.083
I don't care
if this is your swamp.

59
00:05:45.214 --> 00:05:46.824
- You can talk?
- Hm!

60
00:05:46.955 --> 00:05:49.523
Hi. Eurydice B. Magillicuddy.

61
00:05:49.653 --> 00:05:52.395
However. you can call me
Mrs. Mac.

62
00:05:52.526 --> 00:05:54.136
Thanks for saving me.

63
00:05:54.266 --> 00:05:55.485
I was almost like...

64
00:05:55.616 --> 00:05:58.358
A goner?
Oh. all in a day's work!

65
00:05:58.488 --> 00:06:04.015
Now. where might one find
a hearty bowl
of calcium-rich liquid gold?

66
00:06:04.146 --> 00:06:07.497
<i>It's funny the companions

<i>She went from the most

<i>to. well. a klutz.</i>

74
00:06:31.521 --> 00:06:34.045
You're gonna be late again!

75
00:06:34.176 --> 00:06:35.395
Antony...

76
00:06:35.525 --> 00:06:37.745
<i>And an overprotective one
at that.</i>

77
00:06:37.875 --> 00:06:40.922
<i>It weren't his fault.
Not really.</i>

78
00:06:41.052 --> 00:06:43.794
<i>If only they didn't make
those little plastic
building blocks</i>

79
00:06:43.925 --> 00:06:46.231
<i>so damned tasty

80
00:06:57.547 --> 00:07:01.421
<i>Doctor told her to best keep
a closer eye on him
moving forward.</i>

81
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.859
<i>And did she ever.</i>

82
00:07:24.182 --> 00:07:27.664
Have yourself a day
wherever you are.

83
00:07:34.628 --> 00:07:36.194
- Now. do you have your--
- I'm gonna be late.

84
00:07:36.325 --> 00:07:38.196
Then you should have
gotten up sooner.

85
00:07:38.327 --> 00:07:39.633
- Have you charged your phone
in case there's an emergency?
- Mom.

86
00:07:39.763 --> 00:07:41.417
- Yes.
- It's better safe than sorry.

87
00:07:41.548 --> 00:07:43.550
- Yes. Mom. I'm gonna be late.
- Okay. Drink.

88
00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.421
- What? What is this?
- Just drink it.

89
00:07:45.552 --> 00:07:47.467
- I gotta go.
- It's good for you.

90
00:07:49.686 --> 00:07:51.035
Gross.

91
00:07:53.342 --> 00:07:56.258
<i>She still thinks
I'm three years old.
I'm being suffocated.</i>

92
00:07:56.388 --> 00:07:58.565
Yeah. suffocated
by your mom.

93
00:07:58.695 --> 00:07:59.957
Yeah. that'd suck.

94
00:08:00.697 --> 00:08:03.787
Dude. really?
I'm baring my soul here.

95
00:08:03.918 --> 00:08:06.660
I mean. my mom never crossed
the entire Arabian desert

96
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:08.966
on nothing but
a gallon of water.

97
00:08:09.097 --> 00:08:13.536
Just to get lost
at sea for 75 days
on an inflatable raft.

98
00:08:13.667 --> 00:08:16.583
fending off pirates at
every turn. I'm just saying.

99
00:08:16.713 --> 00:08:18.280
Yeah. well. don't.

100
00:08:25.809 --> 00:08:27.158
Hey. Ant. come on.

101
00:08:29.117 --> 00:08:31.511
It's gonna be
a boring party anyway.

102
00:08:38.213 --> 00:08:40.563
Mm. I love you.
Miss Armstrong.

103
00:08:43.784 --> 00:08:45.307
Damn. what the--

104
00:08:45.437 --> 00:08:47.004
Good morning.
sleeping beauty.

105
00:08:47.135 --> 00:08:48.658
Lay off me. Lennon.

106
00:08:51.835 --> 00:08:56.797
And here we have the rare beast.
the galactus stare-a-sarus.

107
00:08:56.927 --> 00:09:00.148
-  I'm sorry.
I wasn't. um...
- I'm just messing with you.

108
00:09:02.933 --> 00:09:05.457
Okay. you lot. Settle down.

109
00:09:05.588 --> 00:09:07.677
Sorry. I'm late.

110
00:09:07.808 --> 00:09:11.246
Traffic was a disaster.

111
00:09:14.902 --> 00:09:16.381
All right. Right. right. right.

112
00:09:19.254 --> 00:09:20.429
Good morning. class.

113
00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.736
Good morning.
Miss Armstrong.

114
00:09:22.866 --> 00:09:24.781
Good morning.
Antony's mom.

115
00:09:29.133 --> 00:09:35.096
Lennon. as we've previously
discussed. in this room.
I am Miss Armstrong.

116
00:09:35.226 --> 00:09:38.403
Perhaps you would like the hour
in detention to reflect on that.

117
00:09:38.534 --> 00:09:40.580
-  Ooh!

118
00:09:42.799 --> 00:09:44.671
Oh. do you need a sweater?
Are you cold?

119
00:09:44.801 --> 00:09:46.411
- No?
- No. Stop it.

120
00:09:47.543 --> 00:09:50.198
Right. onto the fun stuff.

121
00:09:50.328 --> 00:09:52.417
This semester's book report.

122
00:09:55.551 --> 00:09:59.642
No. No. no. I think
you'll really get a kick
out of this one.

123
00:09:59.773 --> 00:10:04.604
Now. this particular book
is written by a man who goes
by the name of Samuel Clemens.

124
00:10:04.734 --> 00:10:06.562
Nah. Mark Twain wrote that.

125
00:10:06.693 --> 00:10:08.433
That's a pseudonym.
his pen name.

126
00:10:08.564 --> 00:10:10.174
He named his pen?

127
00:10:10.827 --> 00:10:12.437
Like a stage name?

128
00:10:12.568 --> 00:10:15.266
Yeah. like Lennon's mom
has at the zoo.

129
00:10:15.397 --> 00:10:16.964
Bobo. the-- Ow!

130
00:10:17.094 --> 00:10:19.183
Do you want more detention?

131
00:10:19.314 --> 00:10:21.969
Yes. Lu. that's exactly right.

132
00:10:22.099 --> 00:10:23.710
And the reason
he chose that name

133
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.408
is because it was the call
to the riverboat captains

134
00:10:26.538 --> 00:10:30.064
to let them know that
the water was deep enough
for them to travel through.

135
00:10:30.194 --> 00:10:32.501
"Land ho! Mark Twain. captain!"

136
00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:36.113
Uh. Miss Armstrong.
are you sure we should be
learning about this book?

137
00:10:36.244 --> 00:10:38.681
It has antiquated values.

138
00:10:40.204 --> 00:10:42.946
There's validity to that point.

139
00:10:44.034 --> 00:10:46.123
But the book can't be
dismissed outright.

140
00:10:46.689 --> 00:10:51.389
Now. this offers us
incredible insight
into America's troubled past.

141
00:10:52.303 --> 00:10:57.613
This is really a parable
on developing moral code
through loyalty and friendship.

142
00:10:57.744 --> 00:11:00.877
all while showing kids
how to have some damn fun.

143
00:11:01.008 --> 00:11:04.054
I want all of you
to go treasure hunting.

144
00:11:04.185 --> 00:11:05.534
Okay.

145
00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:07.797
Through the pages
of this wonderful book.

146
00:11:07.928 --> 00:11:10.757
and you tell me how you think
Tom Sawyer and his friends

147
00:11:10.887 --> 00:11:13.847
would survive
in our modern world. Okay?

148
00:11:14.412 --> 00:11:17.546
Pass that up.
I've paired you off
into groups of three.

149
00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:19.809
Hey. we're book report mates.

150
00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.944
Wow! Uh. I mean.
uh. good. Great.

151
00:11:29.601 --> 00:11:31.212
<i>Mr. Twain liked to say.</i>

152
00:11:31.342 --> 00:11:34.824
"Never let your schooling
interfere with your education."

153
00:11:34.955 --> 00:11:38.567
For. after all. the man
who does not read books

154
00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:41.657
has no advantage over the man
who cannot read them.

155
00:11:44.051 --> 00:11:46.749
If you have any questions.
just come up and see me.

156
00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.928
Hey. you wanna
hang out after class?

157
00:11:52.059 --> 00:11:53.538
- Yeah.
- Cool.

158
00:11:53.669 --> 00:11:55.976
We can go over who will do
what with the assignment.

159
00:11:56.846 --> 00:11:58.761
Oh. right.
Yeah. of course.

160
00:11:58.892 --> 00:12:00.067
Cool. Sweet. See you.

161
00:12:01.633 --> 00:12:03.548
Hey. Ant. I'll be out
in a minute. okay?

162
00:12:03.679 --> 00:12:04.724
Okay.

163
00:12:09.816 --> 00:12:11.643
Hey. Miss Armstrong.

164
00:12:11.774 --> 00:12:14.298
Oh. Woody.
do you have a question
about the assignment?

165
00:12:14.429 --> 00:12:17.084
No. Um. I. uh...

166
00:12:18.302 --> 00:12:19.782
I made you something.

167
00:12:20.522 --> 00:12:21.915
You...

168
00:12:22.045 --> 00:12:26.006
made me something. again.

169
00:12:26.136 --> 00:12:28.573
Um. that's very sweet.

170
00:12:28.704 --> 00:12:30.750
Oh. I-I was inspired
by that story you told us

171
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.840
about the time you were lost
in the jungles of Malaysia.

172
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:35.450
- Right. Yeah.

173
00:12:41.848 --> 00:12:43.937
- Wow.
- Yeah.

174
00:12:44.067 --> 00:12:46.983
Uh. that's very lovely.

175
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:49.856
What is it?

176
00:12:50.073 --> 00:12:52.423
It-it lets you hear
what animals are thinking.

177
00:12:52.554 --> 00:12:54.861
I-I figured since Mrs. Mac
never leaves your side.

178
00:12:54.991 --> 00:12:57.254
it'd be cool to hear
what she's thinking.

179
00:12:57.385 --> 00:13:00.475
See. you just press
this button right here.
and then...

180
00:13:05.175 --> 00:13:06.263
Voila!

181
00:13:12.748 --> 00:13:16.491
Maybe she just doesn't have
a whole lot going on upstairs.

182
00:13:17.579 --> 00:13:19.929
But I will try again tonight
when I get home.

183
00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.583
So. thank you.

184
00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.022
Bye. Miss Armstrong.

185
00:13:28.285 --> 00:13:31.811
Get this ridiculous
thing off my head right now.

186
00:13:31.941 --> 00:13:36.032
And don't think I won't forget.
"Maybe she doesn't have
much going on upstairs."

187
00:13:36.163 --> 00:13:39.166
Some days I really think
I should have just let
that gator take you.

188
00:13:39.296 --> 00:13:40.863
Hush. you.

189
00:13:40.994 --> 00:13:43.344
Okay.
Onto the matter at hand.

190
00:13:43.474 --> 00:13:46.564
Ah. yes. The interview.
Are you ready?

191
00:13:46.695 --> 00:13:49.611
No. No. I. um.
I'm freaking out about it.

192
00:13:49.741 --> 00:13:51.656
Come on.
we did this last night.

193
00:13:51.787 --> 00:13:54.137
- What are you?
- I'm a tiger.

194
00:13:54.268 --> 00:13:56.226
- I can't hear you.
- I'm a tiger.

195
00:13:56.357 --> 00:13:57.575
And what does a tiger do?

196
00:13:57.706 --> 00:13:59.664
They devour their prey.

197
00:13:59.795 --> 00:14:01.057
And what are you
going to do?

198
00:14:01.188 --> 00:14:02.972
I'm going to devour my prey.

199
00:14:03.103 --> 00:14:04.191
So let's get to it.

200
00:14:04.321 --> 00:14:07.411
Okay.
I am a tiger.

201
00:14:07.542 --> 00:14:09.413
I'm a tiger.
I'm perfect for this job.

202
00:14:09.544 --> 00:14:12.503
I'm the only person
for this job.

203
00:14:12.634 --> 00:14:14.201
I'm gonna get this job.

204
00:14:19.771 --> 00:14:20.990
- Aggy.
- Hi.

205
00:14:21.121 --> 00:14:23.863
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course. Jenny.

206
00:14:23.993 --> 00:14:27.736
It's not every day
that you get to interview
for your dream job.

207
00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:31.174
Oh.

208
00:14:31.827 --> 00:14:34.047
Oh. I-- I've come across
too eager. haven't I?

209
00:14:34.177 --> 00:14:35.875
Oh. no. no. no. no. Um...

210
00:14:37.485 --> 00:14:40.575
Aggy. this is--
this is just awkward. Uh...

211
00:14:41.619 --> 00:14:46.450
The head of the natural
history position has.
um. it's been filled.

212
00:14:48.061 --> 00:14:49.062
Oh.

213
00:14:50.846 --> 00:14:52.979
Oh. Um...

214
00:14:53.936 --> 00:14:56.504
Was it-- was it something I did?

215
00:14:56.634 --> 00:15:00.116
No. no. no. no. I mean.
you're one of our
favorite teachers.

216
00:15:00.247 --> 00:15:01.988
It was sudden.
you know?

217
00:15:02.118 --> 00:15:04.991
And I mean. honestly.
I didn't even have much say.

218
00:15:05.121 --> 00:15:09.386
I've been practically
training my entire life
for this type of position.

219
00:15:09.517 --> 00:15:11.562
Oh. I know. I mean.
we all love hearing

220
00:15:11.693 --> 00:15:14.522
all the stories of your
youthful endeavors.

221
00:15:14.652 --> 00:15:16.654
It's just that. um...

222
00:15:16.785 --> 00:15:23.009
Well. someone applied that
has a more. just slightly
more recent résumé.

223
00:15:23.139 --> 00:15:24.271
- Really?
- Yeah.

224
00:15:24.401 --> 00:15:25.750
Who?

225
00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.238
- Agatha.
- AJ.

226
00:15:35.847 --> 00:15:38.763
Oh. wait.
Oh. you two. you--
you know each other.

227
00:15:38.894 --> 00:15:40.113
- We do.
- We do. Yes.

228
00:15:40.243 --> 00:15:42.376
- Agatha used to be my...
- Acquaintance.

229
00:15:43.116 --> 00:15:44.682
What are you doing in town?

230
00:15:44.813 --> 00:15:47.990
Well. the school was in need
of a world-renowned explorer

231
00:15:48.121 --> 00:15:49.949
to head the natural
history department.

232
00:15:50.079 --> 00:15:54.779
and. uh. I was in between gigs
and thought. "What the hell?"

233
00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.784
Do you mind
if Jenny and I talk?

234
00:15:59.915 --> 00:16:01.308
Ooh. no. no. no.

235
00:16:01.438 --> 00:16:02.657
Go right ahead.

236
00:16:06.487 --> 00:16:08.228
Oh. we're gonna sit. Okay.

237
00:16:10.665 --> 00:16:13.015
Oh! Yeah. of course.

238
00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.061
Bye.

239
00:16:17.585 --> 00:16:22.503
I am 100 times
the scholar he is.
You do realize that.

240
00:16:22.633 --> 00:16:23.765
I know.

241
00:16:24.418 --> 00:16:26.986
Listen. the school board
notified us that due
to rezoning.

242
00:16:27.116 --> 00:16:29.118
we now have too many
schools in our district.

243
00:16:29.249 --> 00:16:31.991
And with cuts to funding.
they now have to close one.

244
00:16:32.121 --> 00:16:33.427
And we're at the top
of the list?

245
00:16:33.557 --> 00:16:35.733
- I mean--
- Yes. yes. we are.

246
00:16:35.864 --> 00:16:37.518
I mean. it's been
a rough few years.

247
00:16:37.648 --> 00:16:39.172
First COVID.
and now this.

248
00:16:39.302 --> 00:16:41.565
And so we need something
that will set us apart

249
00:16:41.696 --> 00:16:43.263
and elevate us in the eyes
of the school board.

250
00:16:43.393 --> 00:16:45.439
But my résumé would
run circles around his.

251
00:16:45.569 --> 00:16:47.658
But you haven't updated it
in over a decade.

252
00:16:51.053 --> 00:16:54.926
Aggy. we need someone
who is more of a risk-taker

253
00:16:55.057 --> 00:16:57.451
and can reinvigorate
the kids' interest.

254
00:16:57.581 --> 00:17:00.976
and we feel like having
AJ leading the history
department will do that.

255
00:17:01.107 --> 00:17:03.718
Really? Him?

256
00:17:04.414 --> 00:17:05.807
Look. I'm sorry.

257
00:17:11.769 --> 00:17:13.902
Oh! I'm just--

258
00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:16.209
Oh. Mr. Harrison.

259
00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:19.690
Oh. you have my full support
if you should even need it.

260
00:17:19.821 --> 00:17:23.477
And. you know. if you
find yourself abandoned
on the side of the road.

261
00:17:23.607 --> 00:17:26.262
just go ahead.
Give me a call.

262
00:17:26.393 --> 00:17:27.481
Not!

263
00:17:27.611 --> 00:17:30.092
- You...
- Aggy.

264
00:17:30.223 --> 00:17:31.833
We'll always have Morocco.

265
00:17:39.319 --> 00:17:42.104
<i>Everyone thinks
I'm a mommy's boy. even Lu.</i>

266
00:17:42.235 --> 00:17:44.193
I don't think
you're a mommy's boy.

267
00:17:44.976 --> 00:17:48.067
- Gee. thanks.
-  I gotta go.

268
00:17:48.676 --> 00:17:50.069
All right.
I'll see you. man.

269
00:17:50.199 --> 00:17:52.114
Catch you on
the flip side.

270
00:17:55.726 --> 00:18:00.122
Looky here.
It's Mommy Armstrong's
favorite student.

271
00:18:00.253 --> 00:18:02.429
And there's me.
the least favorite.

272
00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:04.170
You know. you should think
about paying the school rent.

273
00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.172
- given how much
you're in detention.

274
00:18:07.129 --> 00:18:09.566
Talking to me like that
takes some guts.

275
00:18:09.697 --> 00:18:11.699
How about you say
we take a closer look at 'em?

276
00:18:12.308 --> 00:18:13.309
Not today.

277
00:18:16.704 --> 00:18:18.314
You're dead meat. Armstrong!

278
00:18:18.445 --> 00:18:20.142
I'll be comin' for you.

279
00:18:26.844 --> 00:18:28.150
<i>Okay.</i>

280
00:18:28.281 --> 00:18:30.631
No. he's fine. He's fine.

281
00:18:30.761 --> 00:18:33.155
He's gonna be home.
He's gonna be home.
He's gonna be fine.

282
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.462
Oh. my God. Ant.

283
00:18:35.592 --> 00:18:37.116
You're safe.
You worried me.

284
00:18:37.246 --> 00:18:38.508
Where were you?
Why didn't you call me?

285
00:18:38.639 --> 00:18:40.249
I'm 30 minutes late.
Just chill.

286
00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:42.643
No. I won't chill.
You worried me.

287
00:18:42.773 --> 00:18:46.995
Fine. I'm late because
the bozo you gave detention to
took it out on me.

288
00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:48.910
Okay. You don't
have to shout.

289
00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.782
I do need to shout. Mom.
because you don't listen.

290
00:18:52.783 --> 00:18:55.090
Why can't you just
let me be a normal kid?

291
00:19:04.491 --> 00:19:06.319
I can't do this anymore.

292
00:19:07.189 --> 00:19:10.236
I can't live with her watching
over me all the damn time.

293
00:19:37.524 --> 00:19:42.093
<i>Well. if you ask me.
no good can ever come
from running away from home.</i>

294
00:19:42.224 --> 00:19:47.011
<i>Just see for yourself
how that worked out
for ol' Tom and my Grandpa Joe.</i>

295
00:19:47.142 --> 00:19:50.276
<i>But it sure does make
for one hell of a story.</i>

296
00:20:23.744 --> 00:20:25.876
Stupid books everywhere.

297
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:05.264
"To whomever should find this...

298
00:21:05.394 --> 00:21:10.399
My father's story lives forever
in the pages of <i>Tom Sawyer</i>."

299
00:21:14.621 --> 00:21:15.970
Come on. boys.
we're owning them.

300
00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:17.928
Yeah!

301
00:21:25.066 --> 00:21:26.154
He ain't far.

302
00:21:27.068 --> 00:21:28.025
Come on.

303
00:21:28.156 --> 00:21:29.200
- Let's go!
- Yeah!

What's in it for me if I do?

314
00:22:18.946 --> 00:22:20.904
- I'll let you live.
-  Yeah.

315
00:22:21.035 --> 00:22:23.646
You can work a double shift.
digging me gold.

316
00:22:24.778 --> 00:22:26.170
That ain't no deal.
I want in on.

317
00:22:26.301 --> 00:22:27.737
No!

318
00:22:30.784 --> 00:22:32.307
What do you want?

319
00:22:32.438 --> 00:22:35.136
Enough to set up my family.

320
00:22:35.745 --> 00:22:37.878
Let us live peaceably.

321
00:22:38.008 --> 00:22:39.749
The rest is yours.

322
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.795
-  Ow.

323
00:22:41.925 --> 00:22:43.971
You idiot!

324
00:22:54.982 --> 00:22:56.810
Tom Sawyer.

325
00:22:58.333 --> 00:22:59.900
Tell your Aunt Polly.

326
00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:01.684
Angus sent you.

327
00:23:07.908 --> 00:23:09.083
What's so funny?

328
00:23:11.564 --> 00:23:13.304
That ain't the real map.

329
00:23:16.917 --> 00:23:20.399
Being rich isn't what all
its cracked up to me.

330
00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:23.097
But then.

331
00:23:24.751 --> 00:23:26.492
you'll never find out.

332
00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:36.023
No! You idiots!

333
00:23:37.851 --> 00:23:38.982
Damn it!

334
00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.511
Okay.

335
00:23:46.294 --> 00:23:49.863
So. what's this thing that's
so important. it couldn't
have waited until tomorrow?

336
00:23:50.603 --> 00:23:52.866
- It was real.
- What?

337
00:23:58.915 --> 00:24:02.136
"Mr. Twain recorded it
most exactly as it occurred.

338
00:24:02.266 --> 00:24:04.051
The only thing
he omitted was..."

339
00:24:04.834 --> 00:24:06.532
Where's the rest of it?

340
00:24:06.662 --> 00:24:08.055
No. It's just signed.

341
00:24:08.185 --> 00:24:10.579
Mary Sawyer.
Hannibal. 1923.

342
00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:14.104
"Most of the adventures
recorded in this book
really occurred.

343
00:24:14.235 --> 00:24:16.455
One or two were
experiences of my own.

344
00:24:16.585 --> 00:24:18.892
The rest. those
of classmates of mine."

345
00:24:19.458 --> 00:24:20.459
Now. check this.

346
00:24:24.071 --> 00:24:26.856
"The real Tom Sawyer
and Twain were friends
in San Francisco.

347
00:24:26.987 --> 00:24:29.816
Twain told Sawyer.
'I'm going to write
a book about a boy.

348
00:24:30.469 --> 00:24:33.210
Just such a boy
as you must have been.'"

349
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:35.952
The-the character's
based on a real person.

350
00:24:36.083 --> 00:24:37.606
Plenty are. So what?

351
00:24:37.737 --> 00:24:39.826
So. if it's based
on a real person.

352
00:24:39.956 --> 00:24:42.219
then maybe the events are
based on real events. too.

353
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:44.221
They discovered
pirates' gold.

354
00:24:44.352 --> 00:24:46.223
Okay. $12.000 of it.

355
00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:49.444
- Is that all?
- That was in 1876.

356
00:24:49.575 --> 00:24:53.274
With inflation. that's like
two million dollars.
give or take.

357
00:24:53.404 --> 00:24:54.493
Whoa.

358
00:24:55.145 --> 00:24:57.104
But-- but do you guys think

359
00:24:57.234 --> 00:25:01.195
that this is actually
some real-life journal
of what actually happened?

360
00:25:01.325 --> 00:25:04.677
Listen. this could be.
like. our one time
to do something great.

361
00:25:04.807 --> 00:25:08.202
Like historically huge.
and finally have
people respect us.

362
00:25:08.332 --> 00:25:10.247
What if people find out?

363
00:25:10.378 --> 00:25:13.076
They'll fall over
themselves laughing at us.

364
00:25:13.207 --> 00:25:15.731
They already laugh
at us. Wood.

365
00:25:15.862 --> 00:25:17.820
For two million bucks.
they can do whatever
they like.

366
00:25:17.951 --> 00:25:22.042
Think of all the shiny.
new inventing equipment
you could snap up with that.

367
00:25:22.782 --> 00:25:25.088
I bet my mom would
be mad impressed
with us as well.

368
00:25:26.089 --> 00:25:27.482
Hmm.

369
00:25:29.005 --> 00:25:31.051
But where would
we even start?

370
00:25:31.181 --> 00:25:34.097
- Uh. the letter said
"Hannibal". right?
- Yeah.

371
00:25:34.228 --> 00:25:37.405
That's the town Twain based
St. Petersburg on.

372
00:25:37.536 --> 00:25:39.189
And it's just
one county over.

373
00:25:45.021 --> 00:25:47.241
- Come on. man.
Come on. Woody.
- Come on. Woodster.

374
00:25:47.371 --> 00:25:48.851
Come on. I know.
I can see it in your face.

375
00:25:48.982 --> 00:25:50.461
- Let's do it.
- Woodster!

376
00:25:50.592 --> 00:25:52.333
Let's find
Tom Sawyer's gold.

377
00:25:52.463 --> 00:25:54.770
- All right!
- Yay!

378
00:25:54.901 --> 00:25:58.948
<i>And that's what led
to these young'uns being
in this here predicament.</i>

379
00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:02.169
- Oh! Flashlight.

380
00:26:08.088 --> 00:26:11.047
All right. Everybody.
keep your eyes peeled

381
00:26:11.178 --> 00:26:13.267
in case those wolves
follow us in here.

382
00:26:15.486 --> 00:26:16.923
What are we
even looking for?

383
00:26:18.185 --> 00:26:22.450
Right. The book said
the treasure is two miles
into the cave.

384
00:26:22.581 --> 00:26:24.060
Oh. look.
There it is.

385
00:26:26.715 --> 00:26:27.760
What?

386
00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:29.675
Guys. we're gonna
be billionaires.

387
00:26:29.805 --> 00:26:31.502
This is so much more
than I imagined.

388
00:26:31.633 --> 00:26:34.680
Oh. Ant. what are you
gonna do with your share?

389
00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:37.421
I'm gonna get my own TV
and my own house.

390
00:26:37.987 --> 00:26:40.555
And probably a TV
in each room. Maybe three.

391
00:26:40.686 --> 00:26:43.645
Why not four
and five houses?

392
00:26:43.776 --> 00:26:45.691
Can you guys believe
it was that easy?

393
00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:47.997
- Luxury suits you. Lu.
- Whoa.

394
00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:50.260
Thank you.
One does try.

395
00:26:51.218 --> 00:26:53.133
The hell are you kids
doing in here?

396
00:26:53.655 --> 00:26:55.614
Uh. it-it's ours.
Finders keepers.

397
00:26:57.616 --> 00:26:59.443
Okay. you can have this.

398
00:27:03.273 --> 00:27:04.971
-  Huh?

399
00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.366
Ugh. It's an
amusement park?

400
00:27:09.497 --> 00:27:12.239
State park.
And you're trespassing.

401
00:27:13.022 --> 00:27:14.981
I told you guys
it wasn't real.

402
00:27:19.812 --> 00:27:21.901
<i>Now. as I said.</i>

403
00:27:22.031 --> 00:27:26.688
Tom and Mr. Twain would
never have made it easy as pie
for just anyone to find.

404
00:27:26.819 --> 00:27:30.692
Mr. Twain himself was just
about as wise as four folks
all smashed together himself.

405
00:27:30.823 --> 00:27:32.738
So it was gonna take
about that many. at least.

406
00:27:32.868 --> 00:27:36.698
<i>if anyone was ever
gonna unravel
the mystery of Tom's gold.</i>

407
00:27:40.702 --> 00:27:44.967
Generation after generation
has tried but failed.

408
00:27:45.098 --> 00:27:47.187
searching for
our family fortune.

409
00:27:47.317 --> 00:27:49.580
Tch. Always coming up short.

410
00:27:49.711 --> 00:27:54.977
Until I. AJ Harrison.
discovered

411
00:27:55.108 --> 00:28:00.374
that my protégé.
a woman who I taught
everything that I know.

412
00:28:00.504 --> 00:28:04.247
possesses the letter
that's gonna give me
everything that I want.

413
00:28:04.378 --> 00:28:06.728
Well...

414
00:28:10.297 --> 00:28:12.691
There ain't gonna be
no stopping me this time.

415
00:28:18.784 --> 00:28:19.872
Lennon!

416
00:28:22.178 --> 00:28:23.919
What now. Uncle AJ?

417
00:28:26.226 --> 00:28:28.881
How would you like
to become...

418
00:28:29.011 --> 00:28:30.447
...really rich?

419
00:28:50.903 --> 00:28:53.514
Gotta give you points
for adventurous spirit.

420
00:28:54.297 --> 00:28:57.213
Got a nephew about your age.
can't get him off the computer.

421
00:28:57.344 --> 00:29:00.347
let alone travel in the dead
of the night to hunt treasure.

422
00:29:00.477 --> 00:29:02.610
What's gonna happen to us?

423
00:29:02.741 --> 00:29:08.659
Well. last lot of kids
who went looking for my
great-great-grandpa's gold.

424
00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:11.227
ended up doing 20 to life
in Leavenworth.

425
00:29:19.409 --> 00:29:23.587
Well. I think we can
overlook the criminal
charge this one time. Hm?

426
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:32.292
So. wait. you said. "your
great-great-grandpa's gold"?

427
00:29:32.422 --> 00:29:34.990
Indeed. Tom Sawyer.

428
00:29:35.774 --> 00:29:37.471
That handsome fellow
on the left right there.

429
00:29:37.601 --> 00:29:38.559
What?

430
00:29:38.689 --> 00:29:41.692
He was my granddad's grandpa.

431
00:29:42.476 --> 00:29:44.608
Look. I don't
blame you. kids.

432
00:29:44.739 --> 00:29:48.090
Plenty of folks
from far and wide
have gone searching for it.

433
00:29:49.004 --> 00:29:51.006
I took a shot
at it myself once.

434
00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.443
So you think
it's real. right?

435
00:29:53.574 --> 00:29:57.796
Hmm. Well. it's a wonderful
tale to excite kids.

436
00:29:57.926 --> 00:29:59.623
but it's just that.

437
00:29:59.754 --> 00:30:00.886
A tale.

438
00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:07.501
Alrighty. Who's drawing
the short straw and have me
call their parents first?

439
00:30:09.024 --> 00:30:10.460
Yes?

440
00:30:10.591 --> 00:30:12.636
- Can you spare a moment?
- Sure.

441
00:30:13.246 --> 00:30:15.814
Sit tight.
You're gonna be all right.

442
00:30:25.345 --> 00:30:29.697
I told you. guys. we were
gonna get in trouble. and--

443
00:30:34.528 --> 00:30:36.704
So you were real.
Tom Sawyer.

444
00:30:36.835 --> 00:30:39.750
That's insane.

445
00:30:39.881 --> 00:30:41.274
The three amigos.

446
00:30:42.841 --> 00:30:46.845
"MDCCCLXV.

447
00:30:47.671 --> 00:30:51.545
I mean. I know it's not
the Wi-Fi password.
but. like. what is that?

448
00:30:51.675 --> 00:30:54.026
That's the year. 1865.

449
00:30:56.419 --> 00:30:58.987
They wasted a lot of space
writing it like that. right?

450
00:31:01.076 --> 00:31:04.601
You guys. we've been going
about this all wrong.

451
00:31:05.472 --> 00:31:10.129
Twain wouldn't make it so easy
that the treasure is exactly
where it's supposed to be.

452
00:31:10.259 --> 00:31:13.697
"Under the cross." We've been
thinking about the cross
like a crucifix.

453
00:31:13.828 --> 00:31:16.004
So what do you
think it is?

454
00:31:16.962 --> 00:31:18.920
"Under the cross."

455
00:31:20.704 --> 00:31:23.229
You guys. Chapter X.

456
00:31:23.359 --> 00:31:24.970
It's the one in the tannery.

457
00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:26.493
You guys. this is
our first hot lead.

458
00:31:26.623 --> 00:31:28.321
We can't just sit here
and do nothing.

459
00:31:28.451 --> 00:31:31.237
What do you suggest we do?
Just stroll on out of here?

460
00:31:31.367 --> 00:31:32.803
Uh... Hm.

461
00:31:33.935 --> 00:31:36.068
No. We go out the back door.

462
00:31:37.591 --> 00:31:39.767
Come on. hurry. Go!

463
00:31:39.898 --> 00:31:41.421
- The-- But--
- Shh!

464
00:31:41.551 --> 00:31:43.684
Go! Woody. let's go!

465
00:31:43.814 --> 00:31:45.686
Hah. And now we're fugitives.

466
00:31:53.781 --> 00:31:55.739
Be careful. you idiot.

467
00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:57.959
There's nothing but
a bunch of junk up here.

468
00:31:58.090 --> 00:32:00.701
<i>Look harder.
It's gonna be leather-bound.</i>

469
00:32:00.831 --> 00:32:04.357
It's gonna be yellowed.
aged. stitched with a binder.

470
00:32:04.487 --> 00:32:06.315
<i>It's gonna have lots of pages.</i>

471
00:32:06.446 --> 00:32:08.883
I know what a book
looks like. Uncle AJ.

472
00:32:33.299 --> 00:32:34.343
Lennon?

473
00:32:38.957 --> 00:32:40.219
Hello?

474
00:32:40.349 --> 00:32:42.482
Miss Armstrong?
This is Detective Thatcher.

475
00:32:42.612 --> 00:32:45.137
Firstly. don't worry.
they're fine.

476
00:32:45.267 --> 00:32:47.922
<i>But you'll have
to come to Hannibal
to collect your son.</i>

477
00:32:48.053 --> 00:32:49.097
My son?

478
00:32:49.968 --> 00:32:51.752
No. no. my son's in bed.

479
00:32:51.882 --> 00:32:54.624
No. actually.
they went exploring.

480
00:32:54.755 --> 00:32:57.149
Something about an
assignment you gave them?

481
00:32:57.279 --> 00:32:58.280
What?

482
00:33:00.935 --> 00:33:02.110
Hannibal?

483
00:33:02.241 --> 00:33:04.895
How did they even
get that far? Okay.

484
00:33:05.026 --> 00:33:06.767
Okay. I'm coming.
I'm coming.

485
00:33:07.594 --> 00:33:09.204
Oh. crap.

486
00:33:09.335 --> 00:33:11.250
I think these suckers
beat us to the punch.

487
00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:13.513
Okay. get out of there.
Abort mission.

488
00:33:13.643 --> 00:33:14.862
<i>Get out of there.</i>

489
00:33:18.866 --> 00:33:20.389
Okay.
we'll see you soon.

490
00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.522
Yes. I will keep an eye on them.

491
00:33:30.921 --> 00:33:32.010
Great.

492
00:33:46.111 --> 00:33:48.330
-  It's clear.
- Um...

493
00:33:48.461 --> 00:33:50.767
Oh. the only one I found
is the old Mitchell Tannery.

494
00:33:50.898 --> 00:33:52.987
It says it closed
in 1984. though.

495
00:33:53.118 --> 00:33:54.597
- It's seven blocks away.
- That's where we start.

496
00:33:54.728 --> 00:33:55.772
- Okay.
- Let's go.

497
00:33:58.036 --> 00:34:04.216
<i>What about
a personal security guard
to monitor him 24 hours a day?</i>

498
00:34:04.346 --> 00:34:06.609
You should have taken
that turn back there.

499
00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:10.961
Cat. I remember every single
road. alley. underpass. and
freeway I have ever been on.

500
00:34:11.092 --> 00:34:12.659
I know the way.

501
00:34:12.789 --> 00:34:15.183
When I get
my hands on him...

502
00:34:15.314 --> 00:34:17.055
Well. for someone
with a photographic memory.

503
00:34:17.185 --> 00:34:21.189
it seems to have slipped
your mind what you were like
at his age.

504
00:34:22.930 --> 00:34:24.584
My arms are getting tired.

505
00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:12.110
Here.

506
00:35:14.112 --> 00:35:17.637
"He picked up
a clean pine shingle

507
00:35:17.767 --> 00:35:19.682
that laid in the moonlight.

508
00:35:20.466 --> 00:35:23.382
They buried the shingle
close to the wall."

509
00:35:24.383 --> 00:35:25.384
Here.

510
00:35:25.906 --> 00:35:27.429
It can't be
in here.

511
00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:30.998
It's got to be like an
outside wall then. right?

512
00:35:31.912 --> 00:35:33.522
I saw some shovels coming in.

513
00:35:33.653 --> 00:35:36.395
Grab them quietly.
Now. let's go.

514
00:35:38.136 --> 00:35:39.485
Let's get digging.

515
00:35:49.495 --> 00:35:51.279
- Ant!
- Sorry.

516
00:35:56.806 --> 00:35:58.330
Detective Thatcher?

517
00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:00.201
I'm looking
for Detective Thatcher.

518
00:36:02.116 --> 00:36:03.900
- Hi.

519
00:36:04.031 --> 00:36:05.467
Hi.

520
00:36:05.598 --> 00:36:07.643
Uh. Agatha. Aggy.
Antony's mom.

521
00:36:07.774 --> 00:36:08.905
Yes.

522
00:36:10.472 --> 00:36:12.996
So. uh. did you have
a good drive?

523
00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:15.869
It was fine.

524
00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:18.132
Well. come with me.

525
00:36:18.437 --> 00:36:20.482
- I have a little update
on the kids.
- Oh. okay.

526
00:36:27.663 --> 00:36:28.708
What?

527
00:36:44.811 --> 00:36:45.986
I can't find anything.

528
00:36:46.552 --> 00:36:48.467
This is a waste of time.

529
00:36:48.597 --> 00:36:50.033
All night for...

530
00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:52.775
- ...nothing.
- Wait.

531
00:36:54.212 --> 00:36:57.476
They said they found
the treasure under the X.

532
00:36:57.606 --> 00:37:00.566
Under the X
is Chapter Nine.

533
00:37:00.696 --> 00:37:02.611
Okay. so where are they
in that chapter?

534
00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:05.135
It's the one
in the graveyard.

535
00:37:07.747 --> 00:37:08.965
Come on.

536
00:37:11.751 --> 00:37:13.579
Guess we're going
to a graveyard.

537
00:37:15.363 --> 00:37:17.060
I hate graveyards.

538
00:37:22.022 --> 00:37:23.545
<i>♪ Dip. dip. dip ♪</i>

539
00:37:23.676 --> 00:37:25.504
<i>♪ Three for you ♪</i>

540
00:37:25.634 --> 00:37:26.679
<i>♪ And five for me ♪</i>

541
00:37:26.809 --> 00:37:29.725
Is now really
the time for karaoke?

542
00:37:29.856 --> 00:37:31.597
Sorry. Habit.

543
00:37:32.467 --> 00:37:34.991
I always do it
when I'm worried.

544
00:37:35.122 --> 00:37:37.690
<i>Thatcher. we've got
a break in at the tannery.</i>

545
00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:40.214
<i>Three minors spotted. Over.</i>

546
00:37:40.345 --> 00:37:42.172
Thatcher's responding.

547
00:37:55.273 --> 00:37:57.362
Let's just
do this quick. okay?

548
00:37:57.492 --> 00:38:00.843
Tom said. "Huck. do you
reckon Hoss Williams
hears us talking?"

549
00:38:00.974 --> 00:38:02.367
That's who we're looking for.

550
00:38:02.497 --> 00:38:03.759
Okay. then let's split up.

551
00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:04.978
Call out if you
find something.

552
00:38:05.108 --> 00:38:07.023
- All right.
- Okay.

553
00:38:07.154 --> 00:38:08.982
<i>Come on out. guys.</i>

554
00:38:09.112 --> 00:38:10.723
You're not in trouble.

555
00:38:12.464 --> 00:38:13.900
Antony!

556
00:38:16.468 --> 00:38:17.904
Freshly dug right here.

557
00:38:28.784 --> 00:38:29.872
This is his.

558
00:38:30.917 --> 00:38:32.484
Why is it here?

559
00:38:32.614 --> 00:38:34.703
They said something about
an assignment you gave 'em.

560
00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:36.792
On <i>Tom Sawyer</i>.

561
00:38:37.532 --> 00:38:38.838
Wait.

562
00:38:39.882 --> 00:38:44.017
Tom and Huck buried a pine
shingle at an old tannery
after they witnessed a murder.

563
00:38:44.713 --> 00:38:47.194
Is there a graveyard nearby?

564
00:38:47.325 --> 00:38:49.718
Hannibal Graveyard.
Oldest around.

565
00:38:50.632 --> 00:38:52.112
Then that's where
they are. Let's go.

566
00:39:10.783 --> 00:39:12.306
Hey. come look.

567
00:39:17.964 --> 00:39:19.313
I mean. it's close.

568
00:39:19.444 --> 00:39:20.706
Do you think they're related?

569
00:39:21.794 --> 00:39:24.753
There must be some clues
around here somewhere.

570
00:39:29.497 --> 00:39:30.933
Wait. the--

571
00:39:32.805 --> 00:39:33.849
That's weird.

572
00:39:34.894 --> 00:39:36.765
- What-- Whoa! Whoa! Woody!

573
00:39:36.896 --> 00:39:38.767
No! Whoa.

574
00:39:38.898 --> 00:39:41.248
- Huh? What the--
- Ah!

575
00:39:41.379 --> 00:39:43.555
I think I'm ready
to go home now.

576
00:39:43.685 --> 00:39:44.991
Sorry. Mary.

577
00:39:45.121 --> 00:39:47.863
I told you. guys.
this was a dumb idea.

578
00:39:47.994 --> 00:39:49.952
You guys said.
"Oh. we'll find treasure."

579
00:39:50.083 --> 00:39:53.173
All we've done
is get arrested
and find a skull.

580
00:39:54.522 --> 00:39:57.133
How am I gonna explain
this to my mom?

581
00:39:57.264 --> 00:39:58.787
At least we tried.

582
00:40:03.401 --> 00:40:05.141
I just wanna go home.

583
00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:08.406
I--

584
00:40:08.536 --> 00:40:11.409
Dude. wait. really?

585
00:40:11.539 --> 00:40:12.540
Sorry.

586
00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:16.370
You too? Come on.
guys. seriously?

587
00:40:21.723 --> 00:40:22.811
Hey. wait.

588
00:40:24.509 --> 00:40:26.336
It-it's a--
It's a puzzle.

589
00:40:31.298 --> 00:40:33.126
Guys. we have
to give this up.

590
00:40:33.256 --> 00:40:35.084
We're in enough
trouble as it is.

591
00:40:35.955 --> 00:40:37.086
It's not

592
00:40:38.044 --> 00:40:40.133
Hoss Williams.

593
00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:44.311
It's "Who is...

594
00:40:44.442 --> 00:40:45.747
someone".

595
00:40:47.009 --> 00:40:48.576
Wait. letter mix.

596
00:40:48.707 --> 00:40:50.535
- Yeah.
- Take the S.

597
00:40:50.665 --> 00:40:53.799
and put it in front
of the A and the M. It's "Sam".

598
00:40:54.756 --> 00:40:56.454
And the other S makes "Sill".

599
00:40:57.237 --> 00:40:58.978
"Sam Sill"?

600
00:41:00.066 --> 00:41:01.720
It is real.

601
00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:03.548
So that's it.
"Who is Sam Sill?"

602
00:41:03.678 --> 00:41:05.724
All right. let's go
find Sam Sill then.

603
00:41:05.854 --> 00:41:08.640
- Okay. let's go.

604
00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:10.293
<i>Well. what do you know?</i>

605
00:41:10.424 --> 00:41:13.209
They've gone and done what
no one's ever done before.

606
00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:16.952
Solve the first riddle
of ol' Tom's mystery.

607
00:41:25.395 --> 00:41:27.615
Guys. found him. Over here.

608
00:41:29.704 --> 00:41:31.358
- Sam Sill.
- Nice. dude.

609
00:41:31.489 --> 00:41:33.752
- Whoa! What--

610
00:41:35.449 --> 00:41:36.450
No way.

611
00:41:36.581 --> 00:41:38.234
- Is that the--
- The map.

612
00:41:40.193 --> 00:41:41.673
Do you guys know
what this means?

613
00:41:41.803 --> 00:41:44.414
It means you all
are in huge trouble.

614
00:41:44.545 --> 00:41:46.286
- Hi. Miss Armstrong.
- Hey. Mom.

615
00:41:46.416 --> 00:41:48.549
It would take the remainder
of your teenage years
to blueprint

616
00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:50.595
just how much trouble
you lot are in.

617
00:41:50.725 --> 00:41:53.206
- But. Mom. we have to--
- Antony Auggie Armstrong.

618
00:41:53.336 --> 00:41:56.644
You are so grounded
that your clothes
will be back in fashion

619
00:41:56.775 --> 00:41:58.777
by the time your punishment
is even over.

620
00:41:59.691 --> 00:42:01.997
- Let's go. Now.
- Detective. can you
explain it to her?

621
00:42:02.128 --> 00:42:04.347
- Can you help us out?
- Sorry. guys. I'd love to help.

622
00:42:04.478 --> 00:42:05.871
But as you ran out on me.

623
00:42:06.001 --> 00:42:07.916
it's time to face the music.

624
00:42:08.047 --> 00:42:10.136
- But. Mom. we--
- Now. Antony.

625
00:42:12.791 --> 00:42:14.793
Miss Armstrong.
we're so close.

626
00:42:14.923 --> 00:42:17.622
- Don't you get that it's real?
- Seriously. we were so close.

627
00:42:19.145 --> 00:42:20.320
I knew it.

628
00:42:24.237 --> 00:42:26.152
Hey. Hey. Buttons.

629
00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:29.808
Yeah. I'm thinking of getting
the band back together.

630
00:42:30.983 --> 00:42:34.639
You think you can pull another
Alabama coat hanger for me?

631
00:42:38.033 --> 00:42:41.994
I cannot
believe you would be
so irresponsible. Antony.

632
00:42:42.124 --> 00:42:44.997
But we have proof that the gold
and Tom Sawyer is real.

633
00:42:45.127 --> 00:42:47.477
- Look. we found this map.

634
00:42:47.608 --> 00:42:49.958
No. that is just
a worthless old scroll.

635
00:42:50.089 --> 00:42:51.917
You never believe me.

636
00:42:52.047 --> 00:42:55.660
Do you have any idea
how many wild goose chases
I've been sent on

637
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:57.879
because of a stupid map? No.

638
00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:01.535
No. none of you have any clue
how dangerous it can really be.

639
00:43:01.666 --> 00:43:03.668
How would I
ever get to know?

640
00:43:03.798 --> 00:43:07.410
I mean. you took a job
at my school to watch over me
every second of the day.

641
00:43:07.541 --> 00:43:08.629
I did not.

642
00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:10.588
I like teaching.

643
00:43:10.718 --> 00:43:12.154
You hate teaching.

644
00:43:12.285 --> 00:43:14.417
You love adventure.

645
00:43:14.548 --> 00:43:16.245
I mean. at least you used to

646
00:43:16.376 --> 00:43:18.247
before you had me.

647
00:43:18.378 --> 00:43:20.380
before you scared Dad away.

648
00:43:24.123 --> 00:43:27.387
Now I have an overprotective
mother and an absent father.

649
00:43:27.517 --> 00:43:29.302
and neither of us
have fun ever.

650
00:43:30.433 --> 00:43:32.174
It's because
I love you. okay?

651
00:43:33.262 --> 00:43:35.438
Then I'd hate to see
how you'd be if you hated me.

652
00:43:39.399 --> 00:43:41.444
You dropped this.
by the way.

653
00:43:43.011 --> 00:43:44.491
Why did you
even take that?

654
00:43:46.798 --> 00:43:48.538
Because I was...

655
00:43:50.236 --> 00:43:54.632
going to find the gold and then
run away to Utah to find Dad.

656
00:43:57.286 --> 00:43:59.854
Ant. your father...

657
00:44:03.075 --> 00:44:04.946
He's a door
best left unopened.

658
00:44:07.253 --> 00:44:08.907
Well. he can't be
any worse than you.

659
00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:31.625
He hates me.
Ant just hates me.
He just-- He hates me.

660
00:44:32.844 --> 00:44:34.367
Your mom's really
talking to herself.

661
00:44:36.804 --> 00:44:38.676
He's just hot under the collar.

662
00:44:38.806 --> 00:44:41.069
But I can't say I blame him.

663
00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:44.856
You know. you'll always
catch more flies with honey
than vinegar.

664
00:44:44.986 --> 00:44:46.118
- Hm.

665
00:44:56.215 --> 00:44:57.782
Damn it.

666
00:44:57.999 --> 00:45:00.959
Ugh. I left the house
in such a hurry.
I forgot my purse.

667
00:45:02.482 --> 00:45:04.353
I need to borrow
your debit card.

668
00:45:04.484 --> 00:45:06.486
I will pay you back
when we get home.

669
00:45:08.009 --> 00:45:09.010
Thank you.

670
00:45:28.726 --> 00:45:30.379
He's proud of me.

671
00:45:34.601 --> 00:45:37.343
<i>They say once you have
that lust for adventure.</i>

672
00:45:37.473 --> 00:45:39.127
it never-- well.
never truly dies.

673
00:45:39.258 --> 00:45:41.782
It lives on inside
of you. dormant.

674
00:45:41.913 --> 00:45:45.525
waiting for that moment
to snatch you back into it.

675
00:45:45.655 --> 00:45:50.617
It's a feeling almost
as pervasive as a mother
not wanting to let her son down.

676
00:45:52.184 --> 00:45:53.272
<i>Almost.</i>

677
00:45:57.580 --> 00:46:00.583
Oh. if-- if we do this...

678
00:46:03.804 --> 00:46:06.459
You took me hostage.
and we are back home
in 24 hours.

679
00:46:06.589 --> 00:46:07.765
- Okay?

680
00:46:07.895 --> 00:46:09.723
- Okay. All right. Mom.
-  Let's go!

681
00:46:09.854 --> 00:46:13.335
It's time I took
the road less traveled again.

682
00:46:15.511 --> 00:46:18.950
All right. buckle up.
It's gonna be a wild ride.

683
00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:21.735
Okay. seriously though.
buckle up. Safety first.

684
00:46:31.571 --> 00:46:34.356
Everyone. act natural.
pretend like I'm not even here.

685
00:46:37.969 --> 00:46:40.275
Ugh. Just put that
away already.

686
00:46:40.406 --> 00:46:42.234
Stupid moths
have eaten half of it.

687
00:46:42.364 --> 00:46:45.803
And half the words are missing.
Nothing here makes sense.

688
00:46:46.412 --> 00:46:52.244
"Dip. dip. dip. if.
nor. bring the..."

689
00:46:52.374 --> 00:46:54.768
The words are so small.
I can't make it out.

690
00:46:55.595 --> 00:46:57.118
I may have just the thing.

691
00:47:02.776 --> 00:47:08.173
Aw. hey. kitty-cat.
Do you wanna learn
how to talky-talk like a person?

692
00:47:08.303 --> 00:47:09.696
- Oh. yes. you do.
- Oh...

693
00:47:09.827 --> 00:47:11.219
- I'm gonna give it
one more try.
- Woody--

694
00:47:11.350 --> 00:47:13.265
- Let's see.
- I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

695
00:47:14.048 --> 00:47:16.529
What the--
I-I didn't put that on yet.

696
00:47:16.659 --> 00:47:17.878
Oh. Mom.

697
00:47:18.009 --> 00:47:19.880
I guess the cat's
out of the bag now.

698
00:47:20.011 --> 00:47:22.230
It would be
a cataclysmic catastrophe

699
00:47:22.361 --> 00:47:25.973
to categorically succumb
to the catalytically
catatonic states

700
00:47:26.104 --> 00:47:28.149
of which you currently cater.

701
00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:30.543
- Huh?
- I gotta get this.

702
00:47:30.673 --> 00:47:32.762
Oh. man. this scene could
use a little more light.

703
00:47:32.893 --> 00:47:34.852
That's okay.
We'll roll with it.

704
00:47:34.982 --> 00:47:38.116
I just want. like. a relaxed
performance from everyone.

705
00:47:38.246 --> 00:47:40.205
Okay? And action.

706
00:47:40.335 --> 00:47:43.425
No. you're not filming me.
I'm going back to my trailer.

707
00:47:48.126 --> 00:47:49.649
Why not?

708
00:47:49.867 --> 00:47:52.695
Hey. all this time and you never
told me Mrs. Mac could talk?

709
00:47:53.827 --> 00:47:55.176
I-I'm...

710
00:47:56.090 --> 00:47:59.746
I guess there's one
or two things I haven't
quite told you about yet.

711
00:48:04.969 --> 00:48:07.536
And I'm assuming that's been
here my entire life. too.

712
00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:09.669
Where's the spare tire?

713
00:48:09.799 --> 00:48:11.279
I don't know. man.

714
00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:14.326
- Okay. Get the map out.
- Okay.

715
00:48:18.112 --> 00:48:21.507
"In Allister's Cove.
the second shall be...

716
00:48:21.637 --> 00:48:24.771
Solve the puzzles there laid.
and look within to see."

717
00:48:24.902 --> 00:48:26.251
It's only accessible
through the bayou.

718
00:48:26.381 --> 00:48:27.992
It's about five miles
down the road.

719
00:48:28.209 --> 00:48:30.951
Pack up the map.
Woody. grab what you can
from the kit. And. Lu?

720
00:48:31.691 --> 00:48:32.997
Keep filming.

721
00:48:33.127 --> 00:48:34.259
You got it.

722
00:48:35.477 --> 00:48:36.609
Okay. let's go.

723
00:48:41.527 --> 00:48:43.311
- Uh...
- Hi.

724
00:48:44.704 --> 00:48:45.792
It's fine.

725
00:48:47.141 --> 00:48:49.796
- Hi.
- Ah. car trouble?

726
00:48:49.927 --> 00:48:51.929
Oh. no.
No. we're fine. We--

727
00:48:52.059 --> 00:48:54.453
It's just a pit stop.
but we're moving
along now. so...

728
00:48:54.583 --> 00:48:56.542
Yeah. whoa. whoa.
whoa there. Missy. uh...

729
00:48:57.195 --> 00:48:59.458
You can't stop on
the side of the road.

730
00:49:00.328 --> 00:49:01.634
Not in this town.

731
00:49:01.764 --> 00:49:03.853
Oh. okay. I'm--
I'm sorry. I didn't--

732
00:49:03.984 --> 00:49:07.814
I didn't know what the rules
in this district were.
but it won't happen again.

733
00:49:07.945 --> 00:49:11.426
Oh. you wouldn't be
on a treasure hunt now.
would you?

734
00:49:12.688 --> 00:49:15.561
No. No. we're going home.

735
00:49:16.779 --> 00:49:18.477
- Kids?
- The map.

736
00:49:19.695 --> 00:49:21.828
- Uh-huh. Map?
-  Uh...

737
00:49:21.959 --> 00:49:23.743
- What map?
- Oh. hmm.

738
00:49:23.873 --> 00:49:26.006
Wise girl. huh?
Hand it over now.

739
00:49:26.137 --> 00:49:28.052
- Mom.
- Give it to him.
give it to him.

740
00:49:28.878 --> 00:49:29.967
No. don't.

741
00:49:34.841 --> 00:49:37.235
Pick it up.
I ain't playing. kid.

742
00:49:43.328 --> 00:49:44.546
- Run!
- Go!

743
00:49:44.677 --> 00:49:45.634
- Go. go!
- Go!

744
00:49:45.765 --> 00:49:46.853
Ugh!

745
00:49:49.073 --> 00:49:50.726
That's not mud!

746
00:49:53.773 --> 00:49:54.817
Run!

747
00:49:54.948 --> 00:49:57.298
-  Go! Go.

748
00:49:57.907 --> 00:49:59.605
- Whoa.

749
00:49:59.735 --> 00:50:00.867
Where do we go?
Where do we go?

750
00:50:00.998 --> 00:50:02.260
- Is he following us?
- Keep going.

751
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:04.305
This way. This way.
Don't look back.

752
00:50:04.436 --> 00:50:06.090
- Just keep going.

753
00:50:11.095 --> 00:50:12.226
Brats.

754
00:50:14.098 --> 00:50:17.101
Excellent work. my old pal.

755
00:50:17.231 --> 00:50:19.103
You just earned
your 20 percent.

756
00:50:19.233 --> 00:50:21.235
- Hey. what about me?
- Shut up. Lennon.

757
00:50:21.366 --> 00:50:23.716
A chance to get that turd back
will sweeten the deal.

758
00:50:23.846 --> 00:50:26.197
Oh. you're gonna get it.
And then some.

759
00:50:28.199 --> 00:50:29.548
It's in Allister's Cove.

760
00:50:30.331 --> 00:50:32.899
Allister's Cove. All right.

761
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:36.772
That means
we're gonna go up
and around the bayou.

762
00:50:37.382 --> 00:50:39.906
Then let's move.
Let's move.

763
00:50:40.037 --> 00:50:42.169
Hey. can you carry
some. Uncle AJ?

764
00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:45.390
Lennon. I'm carrying the map.

765
00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:46.869
- Do you wanna be rich?
- Yeah.

766
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.089
You consider yourself
an athlete?

767
00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:50.395
Then let's move.

768
00:50:53.789 --> 00:50:55.400
- Okay.

769
00:50:56.401 --> 00:50:57.663
I think we're clear.

770
00:50:58.968 --> 00:50:59.969
- Oh. no.
- Are you okay?

771
00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:03.016
Are you okay. bud?

772
00:51:04.278 --> 00:51:06.411
Sorry. guys. we--
we lost the map.

773
00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:11.242
That's okay. because we have
a budding filmmaker
who got it all on tape.

774
00:51:11.372 --> 00:51:13.766
I was actually just getting
you guys' close-up shots.

775
00:51:13.896 --> 00:51:15.985
I was gonna get
a pickup shot
of the map later.

776
00:51:16.116 --> 00:51:17.987
Well. that's that.
We're done.

777
00:51:18.118 --> 00:51:20.773
No. no. no. no. no.
I'm not gonna let that happen.

778
00:51:20.903 --> 00:51:23.863
Look. when I was your age.
I was running all over the place

779
00:51:23.993 --> 00:51:26.083
chasing after
all sorts of things.

780
00:51:26.213 --> 00:51:29.695
But you guys have gotten closer
than anyone ever has with this.

781
00:51:29.825 --> 00:51:30.957
We're gonna see this through.

782
00:51:31.088 --> 00:51:32.915
We're gonna keep
doing this. okay?

783
00:51:33.046 --> 00:51:34.134
But how?

784
00:51:35.875 --> 00:51:37.790
Hand me a pen and paper
from the kit.

785
00:51:40.923 --> 00:51:43.578
An elephant never forgets.

786
00:51:44.449 --> 00:51:47.016
So either I'm part elephant
or it's very fortuitous

787
00:51:47.147 --> 00:51:49.802
that you have a chaperone
who has photographic memory.

788
00:51:50.977 --> 00:51:52.544
- No way.
- Whoa. Whoa.

789
00:51:52.674 --> 00:51:54.894
And why didn't you
tell me any of this?

790
00:51:55.503 --> 00:51:57.723
Must have slipped
my mind.

791
00:51:57.853 --> 00:52:00.378
That's funny. Mom. Not.

792
00:52:00.508 --> 00:52:03.032
So you remember everything?

793
00:52:04.512 --> 00:52:05.600
Everything.

794
00:52:06.384 --> 00:52:07.733
Whoa.

795
00:52:10.170 --> 00:52:13.391
Okay. So it looks like we
have to go through the river.

796
00:52:13.521 --> 00:52:14.957
It's a couple of miles
down that way.

797
00:52:15.088 --> 00:52:16.872
so we got to keep going.

798
00:52:17.003 --> 00:52:18.700
- All right?
- Let's go.

799
00:52:18.831 --> 00:52:20.006
Let's do this.

800
00:52:24.619 --> 00:52:26.926
<i>I think we're going
the right way.</i>

801
00:52:27.535 --> 00:52:29.363
At least we're finally
in the clear. right?

802
00:52:32.061 --> 00:52:33.280
Why did you have
to say that out loud?

803
00:52:33.411 --> 00:52:34.890
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
Get back.

804
00:52:35.021 --> 00:52:36.718
- Get back.
- Get back. Get back.
Get behind me.

805
00:52:39.678 --> 00:52:41.245
Shoo! Shoo!

806
00:52:48.469 --> 00:52:50.863
Why are they throwing
rocks at me?

807
00:52:50.993 --> 00:52:52.908
- So rude.

808
00:52:53.039 --> 00:52:55.259
It switched on.

809
00:52:55.389 --> 00:52:57.261
First. you come
to steal my babies.

810
00:52:57.391 --> 00:52:59.393
Then you go
throw rocks at me.

811
00:52:59.524 --> 00:53:02.353
Um. Miss Alligator.
we're not trying
to steal your babies.

812
00:53:02.483 --> 00:53:05.660
Good. You'd be
in a lot more trouble.

813
00:53:05.791 --> 00:53:07.401
What brings you out this far?

814
00:53:07.532 --> 00:53:12.537
Um. we were looking
for Allister's Cove.
but we got lost.

815
00:53:12.667 --> 00:53:14.974
Allister's Cove
is just down the river.

816
00:53:15.104 --> 00:53:19.283
Tell you what. as an apology
for trying to eat you
25 years ago.

817
00:53:19.413 --> 00:53:21.459
why don't you take
that rowboat over there?

818
00:53:24.810 --> 00:53:26.725
Look. I'm sorry
about your eye.

819
00:53:27.465 --> 00:53:30.511
I wish I would have known
all those years ago
that you were...

820
00:53:31.773 --> 00:53:33.471
just trying to protect
your family.

821
00:53:33.601 --> 00:53:35.821
Aw. don't mention it.

822
00:53:35.951 --> 00:53:37.953
Well. so long now.

823
00:53:38.084 --> 00:53:39.694
Y'all have a pleasant trip.

824
00:53:41.479 --> 00:53:44.873
My invention works.
I knew it. I knew it.

825
00:53:45.613 --> 00:53:46.745
-  Oh. yes.
- Good job. Woody.

826
00:53:46.875 --> 00:53:47.963
Yeah. man.

827
00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:51.315
- All right. we gotta keep
a move on.
- That's great.

828
00:53:51.445 --> 00:53:52.968
Let's go. This way.

829
00:54:16.601 --> 00:54:17.602
Let's go.

830
00:54:20.822 --> 00:54:21.867
Okay.

831
00:54:22.694 --> 00:54:24.478
Now I feel like
I'm in a Mark Twain novel.

832
00:54:24.609 --> 00:54:27.176
- Nah. we're in a movie.
- Wow.

833
00:54:27.786 --> 00:54:31.180
Okay. the location
of the next map
is right over that ridge.

834
00:54:31.311 --> 00:54:32.573
Okay. let's go.

835
00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:34.401
Hurry.

836
00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:40.233
This way.

837
00:54:40.364 --> 00:54:41.713
That's my idea.

838
00:54:42.844 --> 00:54:45.847
I think it could work.
but I'll think it out.

839
00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:52.593
"What's done on a dare
yet comes in two pairs?

840
00:54:52.724 --> 00:54:56.118
How I'll spend mine. I know.
but what will you get
with your share?"

841
00:54:57.424 --> 00:54:58.599
Share.

842
00:54:58.730 --> 00:55:00.471
I got it. Okay.

843
00:55:00.601 --> 00:55:04.431
Huck asked Tom
what would he do
with his share of the loot.

844
00:55:04.562 --> 00:55:05.998
Chapter 25.

845
00:55:07.434 --> 00:55:10.132
Yeah. it's right here. Okay.

846
00:55:10.263 --> 00:55:12.483
"Tom said he'll buy
these four things.

847
00:55:13.135 --> 00:55:15.094
A drum."

848
00:55:16.138 --> 00:55:17.923
Uh... Okay. the drum.

849
00:55:20.447 --> 00:55:22.188
"A sure-'nough sword."

850
00:55:22.319 --> 00:55:24.321
- Oh. over there.
- Oh. there it is.

851
00:55:27.411 --> 00:55:29.021
"A red necktie."

852
00:55:29.151 --> 00:55:31.066
Uh. necktie. Got it.

853
00:55:32.851 --> 00:55:34.113
"And a bull!"

854
00:55:37.682 --> 00:55:39.988
- Whoa!
- Whoa! Whoa! Wait!

855
00:55:40.119 --> 00:55:42.077
Wait. bull pup!

856
00:55:42.208 --> 00:55:44.036
- Bull pup!

857
00:55:44.166 --> 00:55:45.864
- Bull pup!
- Bull pup!

858
00:55:51.304 --> 00:55:52.653
Everyone okay?
You okay?

859
00:55:52.784 --> 00:55:54.263
- Yeah.
- I'm so sorry.

860
00:56:05.884 --> 00:56:08.147
Dude. will this
riddle ever end?

861
00:56:08.277 --> 00:56:09.714
Oh.

862
00:56:09.844 --> 00:56:12.978
Woody. this looks like
a task for you.

863
00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:15.284
Here.

864
00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:39.657
You know what we're
gonna do at first light?

865
00:56:39.787 --> 00:56:41.267
Mm-hmm.

866
00:56:41.398 --> 00:56:43.922
- We're gonna track down
those wannabes.
- Mm-hmm.

867
00:56:44.052 --> 00:56:46.751
those imposter
treasure hunters.

868
00:56:47.491 --> 00:56:48.492
and then...

869
00:56:49.884 --> 00:56:53.105
it's all gonna be
about fame and glory.

870
00:56:53.235 --> 00:56:55.673
Oh. and don't
forget the gold.

871
00:56:59.024 --> 00:57:01.418
I almost-- I almost
forgot about the gold.

872
00:57:03.202 --> 00:57:04.769
Let's not forget the gold.

873
00:57:06.814 --> 00:57:08.729
Hey. Lennon.

874
00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:11.471
Are you having trouble
pitching that tent?

875
00:57:11.602 --> 00:57:13.865
"Let's go treasure
hunting." you said.

876
00:57:13.995 --> 00:57:16.955
"It'll be fun." you said.
What is this?

877
00:57:17.085 --> 00:57:19.523
Are you not having fun?

878
00:57:19.653 --> 00:57:23.962
I just thought we could spend
some uncle-nephew time.

879
00:57:24.092 --> 00:57:25.572
Maybe he don't want
his share?

880
00:57:25.703 --> 00:57:26.704
Oh. yeah.

881
00:57:34.146 --> 00:57:36.061
I gotta get this.

882
00:57:36.191 --> 00:57:38.716
Yeah. it's a steamboat.

883
00:57:40.718 --> 00:57:43.634
How's a steamboat gonna
help us find the next map?

884
00:57:43.764 --> 00:57:46.811
Um. maybe it'll float
to where it is.

885
00:57:46.941 --> 00:57:48.552
Well. the map said.

886
00:57:49.161 --> 00:57:51.555
"Look within and you'll see."

887
00:57:58.257 --> 00:58:01.042
Whoa. I think
these are coordinates.

888
00:58:01.173 --> 00:58:02.217
Oh.

889
00:58:03.784 --> 00:58:06.352
- Okay.
- Um. longitude.

890
00:58:07.179 --> 00:58:13.490
27.7676 degrees north.

891
00:58:14.273 --> 00:58:16.971
- Got it.
- Latitude. uh.

892
00:58:17.102 --> 00:58:24.109
82.6403 degrees west.

893
00:58:25.589 --> 00:58:26.720
West...

894
00:58:29.070 --> 00:58:30.115
Oh.

895
00:58:31.595 --> 00:58:33.379
Oh. that's--
that's just right over here.

896
00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:35.642
- Oh!
- Okay. come on. Let's go.

897
00:58:35.773 --> 00:58:37.209
- Come on.
- Check it out.

898
00:58:46.958 --> 00:58:48.176
This is the spot.

899
00:58:49.308 --> 00:58:51.528
Yeah. it's supposed
to be right here. but...

900
00:58:52.616 --> 00:58:54.182
Does it say anything
else in there?

901
00:58:54.313 --> 00:58:55.401
Um...

902
00:58:57.359 --> 00:58:58.404
Wait.

903
00:58:59.361 --> 00:59:00.406
Oh!

904
00:59:01.407 --> 00:59:05.716
Found it.
Uh. "Twain 0.12"?

905
00:59:06.891 --> 00:59:08.501
That cheeky bugger.

906
00:59:09.110 --> 00:59:11.548
- A twain...
- Is a measurement of depth.

907
00:59:12.070 --> 00:59:13.854
You were paying attention.

908
00:59:14.507 --> 00:59:19.860
And 0.12 percent of a twain
is about a foot and a half.

909
00:59:19.991 --> 00:59:21.296
Get the shovel
out of my backpack.

910
00:59:21.427 --> 00:59:22.559
Hold this.

911
00:59:34.222 --> 00:59:36.268
Almost there.
Come on. Woody.

912
00:59:38.662 --> 00:59:40.011
Wait.

913
00:59:46.887 --> 00:59:48.497
Whoa!

914
01:00:04.731 --> 01:00:08.387
Oh. The moths must have eaten
it away like the other map.

915
01:00:08.517 --> 01:00:11.390
No. it needs to be aligned
with the first map.

916
01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.174
Look.

917
01:00:13.305 --> 01:00:15.786
Oh. that-that's why the rhyme
was so weird in the other one.

918
01:00:15.916 --> 01:00:18.005
Well. do you remember
the other words?

919
01:00:18.136 --> 01:00:22.706
I do. but without it
being perfectly lined up.
it-it wouldn't make any sense.

920
01:00:22.836 --> 01:00:24.577
We need that
first map back.

921
01:00:25.839 --> 01:00:28.102
I might have
a stroke of luck for you.

922
01:00:28.233 --> 01:00:31.410
It appears you have
some scallywags following you.

923
01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:34.369
They set up camp
right outside my hidey-hole.

924
01:00:34.979 --> 01:00:36.154
Okay.

925
01:00:36.284 --> 01:00:38.809
Operation Treasure Map
Rescue commence.

926
01:00:38.939 --> 01:00:39.984
Um...

927
01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:43.552
I'll come up with something
snappier on the way.

928
01:00:43.683 --> 01:00:44.728
-  That's true.
- That was terrible.

929
01:00:44.858 --> 01:00:45.903
Please.

930
01:00:48.253 --> 01:00:50.429
<i>So she was about
five-foot-ten.</i>

931
01:00:51.038 --> 01:00:52.605
She said her name
was Margaret.

932
01:00:57.828 --> 01:01:00.787
There's the map. right next
to the water cooler.

933
01:01:00.918 --> 01:01:03.834
Told you guys. bringing this
would come in handy.

934
01:01:03.964 --> 01:01:06.140
Those filmmaking skills
may have just saved the day.

935
01:01:06.271 --> 01:01:08.316
Okay. so here's
what we're gonna do.

936
01:01:09.317 --> 01:01:10.492
Actually...

937
01:01:11.537 --> 01:01:13.278
Ant. what do you think
we should do?

938
01:01:15.062 --> 01:01:17.978
Okay. Um...

939
01:01:18.109 --> 01:01:20.198
Lu. you're gonna sneak in
to get the map.

940
01:01:20.328 --> 01:01:22.243
Copy that.

941
01:01:22.374 --> 01:01:23.984
Woody. you hide behind
the tree and be ready
to protect her. okay?

942
01:01:24.115 --> 01:01:25.420
Sir. yes. sir.

943
01:01:25.551 --> 01:01:27.858
Mom. you circle
around that exit.

944
01:01:28.641 --> 01:01:31.078
- Roger that.
- And I'm gonna distract them.

945
01:01:31.209 --> 01:01:32.993
- Everyone got it?
- Got it.

946
01:01:33.124 --> 01:01:34.125
Right. then.

947
01:01:38.651 --> 01:01:40.435
Well. we're surrounded.

948
01:01:40.566 --> 01:01:42.394
and. uh.
the whole tribe--

949
01:01:42.524 --> 01:01:45.223
- Huh?

950
01:01:45.353 --> 01:01:48.400
- What was that?

951
01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:49.793
Lennon. go
check it out.

952
01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:04.633
You're dead. mama's boy!

953
01:02:13.077 --> 01:02:14.295
Nothing but net. Lennon.

954
01:02:14.426 --> 01:02:16.471
I'm gonna get you!

955
01:02:23.609 --> 01:02:25.089
The map is gone.

956
01:02:26.090 --> 01:02:28.919
The girl's got the map.
Come here. you--

957
01:02:29.049 --> 01:02:31.356
I'm gonna get you!

958
01:02:34.968 --> 01:02:36.143
-  Ha-ha!

959
01:02:37.188 --> 01:02:40.539
Now you know why
they call me Wood-y.

960
01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:46.414
AJ?

961
01:02:47.938 --> 01:02:50.418
Ugh. head of natural history.

962
01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:52.507
I should have known
that you were behind this.

963
01:02:52.638 --> 01:02:55.423
Well. I am
a treasure hunter. Agatha.

964
01:02:55.554 --> 01:02:58.775
and you should know
not to get between
a treasure hunter...

965
01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:01.516
- and his gold.

966
01:03:01.647 --> 01:03:03.431
What are you gonna do.
AJ. hurt me?

967
01:03:03.562 --> 01:03:06.086
Yeah. I am.

968
01:03:06.217 --> 01:03:07.696
You wouldn't dare.

969
01:03:07.827 --> 01:03:09.394
What makes you so sure?

970
01:03:09.524 --> 01:03:12.484
Well. let's face it.
You've always been
in love with me.

971
01:03:15.443 --> 01:03:17.924
Me. in love with you!?

972
01:03:18.055 --> 01:03:20.666
Wow. that is a big alligator!

973
01:03:22.668 --> 01:03:24.235
That is an alligator.

974
01:03:24.365 --> 01:03:27.716
And. uh. we're gonna put
a pin in this for now. Buttons!

975
01:03:27.847 --> 01:03:30.763
- Buttons!

976
01:03:33.679 --> 01:03:34.941
Thanks. Marielle.

977
01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:42.296
<i>So how
do you know him?</i>

978
01:03:42.427 --> 01:03:46.474
I was his. uh.
research assistant
in college.

979
01:03:47.171 --> 01:03:50.696
Yeah. we explored
the world together.
and on our last exploration.

980
01:03:50.827 --> 01:03:53.568
he scammed me.

981
01:03:53.699 --> 01:03:57.007
So. um. we haven't
seen each other since.

982
01:03:57.137 --> 01:03:58.530
- Did you see him?

983
01:03:58.660 --> 01:03:59.879
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

984
01:04:00.010 --> 01:04:02.229
Okay. let's take out
the maps.

985
01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:03.404
Oh.

986
01:04:03.927 --> 01:04:06.364
- Line them up.
- Here.

987
01:04:06.494 --> 01:04:09.889
Um. "Dip to the moonlight.
dip. dip. dip.

988
01:04:10.498 --> 01:04:12.936
Three for you
and five for me."

989
01:04:13.066 --> 01:04:14.067
A riddle?

990
01:04:14.676 --> 01:04:15.764
No. it's a song.

991
01:04:16.722 --> 01:04:18.245
And I know just
where I've heard it.

992
01:04:25.687 --> 01:04:27.385
- Detective!
- Detective Thatcher!

993
01:04:27.515 --> 01:04:29.300
- Is the detective in?
- No. no. no. he's very busy.

994
01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:30.910
- He can't talk right now.
- But we need to speak to him!

995
01:04:32.433 --> 01:04:33.957
What's the commotion about?

996
01:04:34.087 --> 01:04:35.610
You after Huck Finn's
gold now. too?

997
01:04:35.741 --> 01:04:37.743
We made the decision
to keep looking.

998
01:04:37.874 --> 01:04:39.658
Yeah.
and we found these.

999
01:04:39.788 --> 01:04:42.530
When you line them up
correctly. they spell out
this rhyme.

1000
01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:45.620
- That's the family song.
- Mm-hmm.

1001
01:04:45.751 --> 01:04:48.101
I remember you
humming it in the car.

1002
01:04:48.232 --> 01:04:49.798
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.

1003
01:04:50.408 --> 01:04:54.020
You'd make quite
the detective.
Miss Armstrong.

1004
01:04:55.152 --> 01:04:57.197
Oh. you made
quite the impression.

1005
01:05:02.811 --> 01:05:04.117
Uh. you're singing.

1006
01:05:04.248 --> 01:05:05.771
Uh. you're singing made
quite the impression.

1007
01:05:05.902 --> 01:05:07.120
- and that's why...
- Mom.

1008
01:05:07.251 --> 01:05:08.948
- The maps. Come on.
- Right.

1009
01:05:10.994 --> 01:05:13.735
It-it was an old
family song.

1010
01:05:13.866 --> 01:05:16.738
My grandmother
sang it to my father.
who sang it to me.

1011
01:05:17.261 --> 01:05:18.827
Our family
were coal miners.

1012
01:05:19.219 --> 01:05:22.657
and our great-great-grandpa
came up with it
to get his spirits up

1013
01:05:22.788 --> 01:05:25.138
when he was trapped down
in a mine for four days

1014
01:05:25.269 --> 01:05:27.401
- in the 1800s.
-  Mm.

1015
01:05:27.532 --> 01:05:31.101
So it's hinting at being hidden
somewhere deep underground.

1016
01:05:31.231 --> 01:05:34.626
The nearest place
is McDougal's Caves
where we found you guys.

1017
01:05:34.756 --> 01:05:36.541
Ugh. But we already
looked there!

1018
01:05:36.671 --> 01:05:37.890
Yeah. to no avail.

1019
01:05:38.847 --> 01:05:40.501
Not with a Sawyer.
you didn't.

1020
01:05:41.154 --> 01:05:42.677
You're coming?

1021
01:05:42.808 --> 01:05:44.549
- Yes!
- Let's go!

1022
01:05:44.679 --> 01:05:46.290
- Let's find that gold!

1023
01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:47.465
Whoo!

1024
01:05:53.558 --> 01:05:55.212
Oh.

1025
01:05:55.386 --> 01:05:58.084
Legend has it
that more have entered
than have returned.

1026
01:05:58.693 --> 01:06:00.782
So. stay close. guys.

1027
01:06:02.088 --> 01:06:04.525
Does that mean someone
has died in here?

1028
01:06:05.962 --> 01:06:07.615
-  No. Oh!

1029
01:06:10.227 --> 01:06:11.968
Are you sure we should
be doing this?

1030
01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:15.710
Just-- just stay together.

1031
01:06:18.887 --> 01:06:19.932
It's okay. man.

1032
01:06:27.026 --> 01:06:29.898
"Dip to the moonlight."

1033
01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:35.643
Guys. uh. find a place
in the roof where light
can beam through.

1034
01:06:38.603 --> 01:06:39.691
Right there.

1035
01:06:40.779 --> 01:06:41.823
Great.

1036
01:06:42.607 --> 01:06:46.002
Now. if we can "dip. dip. dip"

1037
01:06:46.132 --> 01:06:48.004
- underneath these rocks...
-  Mm-hmm.

1038
01:06:48.134 --> 01:06:49.788
...we should be close.
right here.

1039
01:06:50.528 --> 01:06:53.966
And then it says.
"Three for you
and five for me."

1040
01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:57.317
Paces. right?

1041
01:06:57.448 --> 01:06:59.363
But where do we start?

1042
01:07:00.407 --> 01:07:01.974
Um. we can...

1043
01:07:06.326 --> 01:07:08.850
Oh. Maybe out that cross.

1044
01:07:09.677 --> 01:07:12.332
Yeah. That's gotta
be it. right?

1045
01:07:13.812 --> 01:07:16.032
Okay. so. paces. right?

1046
01:07:16.162 --> 01:07:17.207
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

1047
01:07:17.337 --> 01:07:18.425
Three and five.

1048
01:07:19.818 --> 01:07:23.561
One. two. three.

1049
01:07:25.954 --> 01:07:30.437
One. two. three.

1050
01:07:30.568 --> 01:07:33.440
four. five.

1051
01:07:34.702 --> 01:07:35.964
Look above you.

1052
01:07:37.357 --> 01:07:38.402
Anything?

1053
01:07:39.968 --> 01:07:41.448
I don't know.

1054
01:07:49.326 --> 01:07:51.371
- You got something?
- Yeah. yeah. I think so.

1055
01:07:52.981 --> 01:07:54.983
-  Whoa!
-  Good.

1056
01:07:55.114 --> 01:07:57.073
We found the map.

1057
01:08:03.775 --> 01:08:05.559
- This is so cool.
- Yeah.

1058
01:08:05.690 --> 01:08:08.258
"If flood or fire

1059
01:08:08.388 --> 01:08:10.260
should harm me..."

1060
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:12.175
"I take from you five

1061
01:08:12.305 --> 01:08:13.785
and give you my three."

1062
01:08:15.047 --> 01:08:16.440
"Take from you..."

1063
01:08:16.570 --> 01:08:18.224
- No.

1064
01:08:18.833 --> 01:08:20.139
Take it all from you.

1065
01:08:21.793 --> 01:08:25.318
I would like
to thank the inventor
of this. uh.

1066
01:08:25.449 --> 01:08:27.538
ridiculous contraption.

1067
01:08:27.668 --> 01:08:32.586
The GPS within helped us
track you all the way here.

1068
01:08:35.546 --> 01:08:36.590
Lennon.

1069
01:08:37.896 --> 01:08:39.332
All right. phones out.
Give them up.

1070
01:08:39.463 --> 01:08:40.551
-  No.
- Just do it.

1071
01:08:40.681 --> 01:08:42.466
- Out. out. Now.
- It's not worth it.

1072
01:08:43.945 --> 01:08:47.123
Give me.
Ooh. XR-17. Nice.

1073
01:08:47.253 --> 01:08:50.213
Thank you.
And. of course...

1074
01:08:51.692 --> 01:08:52.998
- You.
- No.

1075
01:08:54.304 --> 01:08:58.221
Oh. This is gonna take me
all the way to the gold.

1076
01:08:58.351 --> 01:08:59.396
You won't get far.

1077
01:09:00.310 --> 01:09:01.528
Just watch me.

1078
01:09:02.703 --> 01:09:06.620
Agatha. you've spent your
whole life chasing history.

1079
01:09:07.317 --> 01:09:08.405
Allow me

1080
01:09:10.363 --> 01:09:11.799
to add you to it.

1081
01:09:21.679 --> 01:09:22.810
Bye-bye now.

1082
01:09:26.074 --> 01:09:27.685
- Back. Go. Go. Now!
- Go to the back!

1083
01:09:27.815 --> 01:09:29.426
Run!

1084
01:09:35.345 --> 01:09:37.347
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
Whoa!

1085
01:09:37.477 --> 01:09:40.001
I think we owe 'em
a moment of respect.

1086
01:09:42.090 --> 01:09:45.093
Agatha. you were
a worthy foe.

1087
01:09:45.224 --> 01:09:48.793
but. uh. you know. we all meet
our makers someday. right?

1088
01:09:48.923 --> 01:09:50.577
And. uh. furthermore.

1089
01:09:52.144 --> 01:09:53.406
that's good.

1090
01:09:53.537 --> 01:09:54.799
Let's go get rich.

1091
01:10:07.115 --> 01:10:08.160
Oh. no.

1092
01:10:10.902 --> 01:10:12.295
This is all my fault.

1093
01:10:13.818 --> 01:10:18.170
What? No. Woody. you are
not to blame for his greed.

1094
01:10:18.953 --> 01:10:21.478
No.

1095
01:10:21.608 --> 01:10:26.570
<i>"And what does
it amount to?" said Satan
with his evil chuckle.</i>

1096
01:10:27.875 --> 01:10:29.703
<i>Nothing at all.</i>

1097
01:10:29.834 --> 01:10:33.229
<i>You always come out
where you went in.</i>

1098
01:10:33.359 --> 01:10:38.364
<i>Oh. for them to get this far
to only have it snatched
at their final hurdle.</i>

1099
01:10:38.495 --> 01:10:41.411
<i>life sure is a kick
in the guts sometimes.</i>

1100
01:10:54.685 --> 01:10:56.600
Someone will be here eventually.

1101
01:10:58.602 --> 01:10:59.820
No. they won't.

1102
01:11:00.865 --> 01:11:02.345
This is hopeless.

1103
01:11:03.694 --> 01:11:06.653
And to think this is how
it's all gonna end.

1104
01:11:08.133 --> 01:11:12.572
And-- and I never even got
the chance to change the world
with one of my inventions.

1105
01:11:13.181 --> 01:11:15.488
I never got to win
an Oscar.

1106
01:11:16.141 --> 01:11:18.535
I never made the news
catching criminals.

1107
01:11:19.623 --> 01:11:21.451
Not even once.

1108
01:11:23.191 --> 01:11:24.758
And I never...

1109
01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:29.763
Oh. no. I've--

1110
01:11:29.894 --> 01:11:33.376
I've really gotten to do
pretty much everything
there is to do.

1111
01:11:33.506 --> 01:11:35.682
so. never mind.

1112
01:11:40.905 --> 01:11:42.254
What about you. Ant?

1113
01:11:43.342 --> 01:11:45.692
Uh. I...

1114
01:11:48.652 --> 01:11:50.480
It's dumb.

1115
01:11:50.610 --> 01:11:53.352
- Mm. come on.
- It doesn't matter.

1116
01:11:54.875 --> 01:11:59.140
Well... Listen.
we just have to look
on the bright side. okay?

1117
01:11:59.793 --> 01:12:02.622
They're not gonna get
very far without that
torn piece from the letter.

1118
01:12:03.884 --> 01:12:07.235
Wait. How do you know
that the letter was torn?

1119
01:12:09.673 --> 01:12:12.371
You told me that it was.

1120
01:12:13.503 --> 01:12:15.374
Uh. no.

1121
01:12:15.505 --> 01:12:16.941
I didn't tell you.

1122
01:12:17.855 --> 01:12:20.074
Okay.

1123
01:12:20.901 --> 01:12:25.341
Well. maybe
this isn't my first time

1124
01:12:26.429 --> 01:12:28.213
looking for Tom Sawyer's
treasure.

1125
01:12:38.136 --> 01:12:39.355
Oh. wait.

1126
01:12:47.798 --> 01:12:49.147
Do you know what this means?

1127
01:12:51.279 --> 01:12:52.455
No.

1128
01:13:11.343 --> 01:13:12.518
- Oh!

1129
01:13:12.649 --> 01:13:15.347
What in the name
of all that's holy?

1130
01:13:15.478 --> 01:13:18.568
Hmm. You don't see that
every-- Oh!

1131
01:13:18.698 --> 01:13:20.831
Come back here.
you wee scully.

1132
01:13:25.009 --> 01:13:26.619
That was a good burger.
my friend.

1133
01:13:27.577 --> 01:13:28.665
Whoa!

1134
01:13:30.797 --> 01:13:33.757
- What?
- That's ten types
of illegal right there.

1135
01:13:43.288 --> 01:13:45.551
We've been going
in circles for hours.

1136
01:13:45.682 --> 01:13:47.335
Do you not know
how to read this map?

1137
01:13:47.466 --> 01:13:48.859
Mm. no.

1138
01:13:48.989 --> 01:13:51.252
Each map seems to point
in a different direction.

1139
01:13:51.383 --> 01:13:54.517
One goes here. one goes there.
one goes nowhere.

1140
01:13:56.344 --> 01:13:57.433
Wait a minute.

1141
01:14:04.918 --> 01:14:08.531
There is a reason
why the world's
most renowned explorer.

1142
01:14:08.661 --> 01:14:10.358
an anthropological--

1143
01:14:10.489 --> 01:14:12.796
You're an anthropologist.
Uncle AJ.

1144
01:14:13.753 --> 01:14:14.798
Whatever.

1145
01:14:15.929 --> 01:14:19.933
The secret hiding place
to Tom Sawyer's gold is...

1146
01:14:21.544 --> 01:14:23.850
- The Temperance Tavern.
- The Temperance Tavern.

1147
01:14:23.981 --> 01:14:25.286
T-this way!

1148
01:14:36.863 --> 01:14:38.430
Oh. what in the dickens?

1149
01:14:39.518 --> 01:14:42.347
Oh. no.
The battery died.

1150
01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:45.481
- Um...
- Oh.

1151
01:14:51.574 --> 01:14:53.663
That's Detective
Thatcher's car.

1152
01:14:53.793 --> 01:14:57.101
Meow. Meow. Meow--

1153
01:14:57.231 --> 01:14:58.668
Okay. fine. I'm a talking cat.

1154
01:14:58.798 --> 01:15:00.017
Yawnfest.

1155
01:15:00.147 --> 01:15:01.758
Now. will you please go
into those caves.

1156
01:15:01.888 --> 01:15:04.021
follow their scent.
and rescue my friends.

1157
01:15:04.151 --> 01:15:07.807
who heavens to Betsy
I fear may well be
trapped down there?

1158
01:15:07.938 --> 01:15:08.939
Let's go.

1159
01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:11.637
And don't you dillydally.

1160
01:15:15.293 --> 01:15:16.468
<i>Thanks. guys.</i>

1161
01:15:17.425 --> 01:15:19.123
Call more reinforcements
to secure the perimeter

1162
01:15:19.253 --> 01:15:20.777
- at the final site.
- Got it.

1163
01:15:21.821 --> 01:15:23.693
- We'll meet you guys there.
- Okay.

1164
01:15:24.389 --> 01:15:25.564
Do we need to draw
the map again?

1165
01:15:25.695 --> 01:15:27.653
No. I know exactly
where it is.

1166
01:15:28.872 --> 01:15:32.092
Hey. um. you did
a really good job in there.

1167
01:15:32.223 --> 01:15:33.529
Oh. thank you.

1168
01:15:53.113 --> 01:15:54.941
As a student of history.

1169
01:15:56.464 --> 01:16:01.426
I have to ask myself what
stories would these walls
tell if they could speak.

1170
01:16:03.167 --> 01:16:06.170
If you bothered to read
the book. you'd already
know the answer.

1171
01:16:07.301 --> 01:16:08.389
Agatha.

1172
01:16:09.695 --> 01:16:10.696
how did you--

1173
01:16:11.088 --> 01:16:12.393
No matter.

1174
01:16:13.307 --> 01:16:17.660
So. bringing your encyclopedic
knowledge of literature
to a gunfight. I see.

1175
01:16:17.790 --> 01:16:19.226
It has perfect aim.

1176
01:16:19.357 --> 01:16:21.141
Well. I will tell you this.

1177
01:16:21.272 --> 01:16:24.928
I'm gonna fill you all
full of new holes
to breathe from

1178
01:16:25.624 --> 01:16:27.626
if you don't tell us
where that treasure is.

1179
01:16:28.322 --> 01:16:31.021
The gold was never hidden
in just one place.

1180
01:16:32.283 --> 01:16:33.850
See. it was...

1181
01:16:34.764 --> 01:16:38.898
always that last line
in the riddle
that really stumped me.

1182
01:16:39.682 --> 01:16:42.206
"Take from you five
and give you my three."

1183
01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:46.950
Ant. what does Twain's opening
passage in his book say?

1184
01:16:48.865 --> 01:16:52.608
"Tom Sawyer is a combination
of the characteristics
of three boys whom I knew.

1185
01:16:52.738 --> 01:16:55.393
and therefore belongs
to the composite order
of architecture."

1186
01:16:55.523 --> 01:17:00.311
So. what are you saying?
Tom Sawyer wasn't real?

1187
01:17:00.441 --> 01:17:01.834
Oh. no. he was real.

1188
01:17:02.922 --> 01:17:05.882
But three made up this story.

1189
01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:15.761
Miss Armstrong. yes.

1190
01:17:15.892 --> 01:17:17.328
I've been expecting you.

1191
01:17:21.985 --> 01:17:24.204
That gold belonged
to just three men.

1192
01:17:24.727 --> 01:17:27.904
Thomas Sawyer. Ben Rogers...

1193
01:17:28.034 --> 01:17:29.209
And Joe Harper.

1194
01:17:30.428 --> 01:17:31.821
My great-grandpappy.

1195
01:17:33.039 --> 01:17:35.302
That ol' Tom Sawyer
made a promise

1196
01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:39.916
to not let that gold
fall into Angus' hands.

1197
01:17:40.046 --> 01:17:43.528
<i>Just as
I promised to never
let it fall into yours.</i>

1198
01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:47.184
<i>You were obsessive
from the day we met
about your family's fortune.</i>

1199
01:17:47.314 --> 01:17:49.273
<i>So after you
double-crossed me.</i>

1200
01:17:49.403 --> 01:17:52.232
<i>I made it my goal to seek out
every last detail</i>

1201
01:17:52.363 --> 01:17:54.887
<i>to ensure you never found it.</i>

1202
01:17:55.018 --> 01:17:58.456
<i>So I destroyed its final secret
to always keep you at bay.</i>

1203
01:17:58.586 --> 01:18:00.893
<i>and I've been carrying
the remainder of that letter</i>

1204
01:18:01.024 --> 01:18:05.506
<i>and the location of the gold
in my head all of these years.</i>

1205
01:18:08.988 --> 01:18:13.036
Wait a minute.
if you had all
this information.

1206
01:18:13.166 --> 01:18:15.516
why didn't you come
for the treasure yourself?

1207
01:18:15.647 --> 01:18:16.735
I tried.

1208
01:18:18.694 --> 01:18:21.000
But not every stone
needs to be turned.

1209
01:18:21.609 --> 01:18:23.394
not every treasure pocketed.

1210
01:18:24.090 --> 01:18:26.440
Well. Aggy...

1211
01:18:27.006 --> 01:18:28.355
That's where we differ.

1212
01:18:29.966 --> 01:18:32.142
See. the only thing
that matters to me...

1213
01:18:33.621 --> 01:18:34.884
Ant!

1214
01:18:35.014 --> 01:18:36.668
You're gonna tell me
where the gold is.

1215
01:18:36.799 --> 01:18:39.323
The safety is on. you moron.

1216
01:18:39.453 --> 01:18:41.194
Moron?

1217
01:18:47.418 --> 01:18:48.680
-  Ah!

1218
01:18:50.943 --> 01:18:52.336
I'll tell you this.

1219
01:18:58.690 --> 01:19:01.258
I was the captain
of my fencing team

1220
01:19:01.388 --> 01:19:02.825
at college!

1221
01:19:03.913 --> 01:19:06.393
Impressive.
But so was I.

1222
01:19:07.177 --> 01:19:09.483
- Get him. Miss Armstrong.
- Come on!

1223
01:19:10.441 --> 01:19:12.399
- Come on. Uncle AJ.
- Let's go. Miss Armstrong.

1224
01:19:17.665 --> 01:19:19.319
- Come on. Uncle AJ!

1225
01:19:23.323 --> 01:19:25.761
- Come on!
- Come on. Miss Armstrong!

1226
01:19:30.287 --> 01:19:31.505
- Ah!

1227
01:19:31.636 --> 01:19:33.029
- Miss Armstrong!
- Be careful!

1228
01:19:34.378 --> 01:19:36.032
It's too bad. Agatha.

1229
01:19:36.162 --> 01:19:39.078
We could have been partners.
It's a shame. isn't it?

1230
01:19:39.209 --> 01:19:40.645
Don't hurt my mom!

1231
01:19:41.211 --> 01:19:43.953
Do what you want.
I might do something like this.

1232
01:19:44.910 --> 01:19:46.346
No!

1233
01:19:46.956 --> 01:19:49.567
What are you gonna
say now. punk? Huh?

1234
01:19:54.702 --> 01:19:56.748
- Mrs. Mac!
- Enough.

1235
01:19:56.879 --> 01:19:58.619
Don't! He's your son.

1236
01:20:00.273 --> 01:20:01.231
He's my what?

1237
01:20:01.361 --> 01:20:02.623
Morocco?

1238
01:20:05.496 --> 01:20:06.976
- Oh.

1239
01:20:07.106 --> 01:20:09.195
And then you left me abandoned
on the side of a cliff.

1240
01:20:09.326 --> 01:20:11.676
I never wanted
to speak to you again.

1241
01:20:11.807 --> 01:20:13.330
Aggy. why didn't you tell me?

1242
01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:15.027
- Freeze!

1243
01:20:15.158 --> 01:20:17.334
Aggy. why didn't you tell me?

1244
01:20:17.464 --> 01:20:19.249
- Cuff him.
- This is my son?

1245
01:20:19.379 --> 01:20:20.772
Now I can see it.

1246
01:20:21.555 --> 01:20:23.906
You're almost
as good-looking as I am.

1247
01:20:24.036 --> 01:20:25.559
- You're under arrest.

1248
01:20:26.299 --> 01:20:28.824
Kidnapping. attempted murder.
assaulting a police officer.

1249
01:20:28.954 --> 01:20:30.869
theft. destruction
of public property.

1250
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.785
And I think you have a case
with animal welfare.

1251
01:20:33.916 --> 01:20:35.787
- Let's go.
- Whatever. cop.

1252
01:20:35.918 --> 01:20:38.834
I'll be out by morning.
I love you. son!

1253
01:20:38.964 --> 01:20:42.402
Aggy! We'll always have Morocco!

1254
01:20:50.846 --> 01:20:52.325
Ant. are you okay?

1255
01:20:53.805 --> 01:20:55.328
I don't even know. man.

1256
01:21:02.292 --> 01:21:03.771
Goodbye. my old friend.

1257
01:21:09.081 --> 01:21:11.344
Excuse me.
who are you calling old?

1258
01:21:11.475 --> 01:21:13.085
Don't play like that.

1259
01:21:13.216 --> 01:21:15.479
- Mrs. Mac...
- You're alive.

1260
01:21:15.609 --> 01:21:20.092
Yes. well. I guess that's.
hmm. five down. four to go.

1261
01:21:21.137 --> 01:21:23.835
Well. you go rest.
We'll be right back.

1262
01:21:23.966 --> 01:21:26.185
Ah. time for a wee catnap.

1263
01:21:26.316 --> 01:21:27.447
So long.

1264
01:21:40.808 --> 01:21:44.247
I now know why you never
told me about him.

1265
01:21:50.818 --> 01:21:51.907
But what about this?

1266
01:21:53.212 --> 01:21:54.213
It's...

1267
01:21:55.606 --> 01:21:57.695
just a dime store novelty.

1268
01:21:58.348 --> 01:22:00.828
I'm sorry. I just--
I thought that

1269
01:22:02.221 --> 01:22:05.529
the mystery of who he was
being wrapped up in a trinket

1270
01:22:06.573 --> 01:22:08.184
felt fitting for us.

1271
01:22:09.576 --> 01:22:11.143
No. yeah. I-I get it.

1272
01:22:12.449 --> 01:22:13.537
Really.

1273
01:22:13.667 --> 01:22:15.017
I'm sorry.

1274
01:22:23.764 --> 01:22:24.809
So...

1275
01:22:25.853 --> 01:22:27.203
there's no gold?

1276
01:22:28.726 --> 01:22:30.815
Oh. no.
there's definitely gold.

1277
01:22:31.772 --> 01:22:34.253
I just had to wait
for the detective
to bring his backup.

1278
01:22:36.255 --> 01:22:37.822
Wait. so then where is it?

1279
01:22:38.866 --> 01:22:41.608
Somewhere out in that yard
are the final clues

1280
01:22:41.739 --> 01:22:44.829
that the three men
who inspired
this very book left.

1281
01:22:45.743 --> 01:22:47.832
Joe Harper. Ben Rogers.
and Tom Sawyer himself.

1282
01:22:47.963 --> 01:22:51.096
And if we find his three.

1283
01:22:51.227 --> 01:22:54.230
then we'll find what
"take from you five" means.

1284
01:22:56.319 --> 01:22:57.537
So. let's go.

1285
01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:01.367
- We're gonna find that gold.
- Yeah.

1286
01:23:25.696 --> 01:23:29.439
Hey. I found a "TS Loves MD".

1287
01:23:29.569 --> 01:23:31.093
Okay. that's one.

1288
01:23:33.921 --> 01:23:35.358
Where are you?

1289
01:23:37.142 --> 01:23:38.839
Oh. I found the second.

1290
01:23:55.465 --> 01:23:56.988
I found Ben Rogers.

1291
01:24:00.861 --> 01:24:03.734
"Take from you five
and give you my three."

1292
01:24:06.389 --> 01:24:09.870
Okay. Take five paces
towards the center.

1293
01:24:18.618 --> 01:24:19.924
So we're standing on it?

1294
01:24:22.013 --> 01:24:24.146
We're about to find out. Shovel.

1295
01:24:24.276 --> 01:24:26.670
- Lu. can you grab mine?
- Yeah.

1296
01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:29.803
<i>Now. if that don't
prove the true meaning
of teamwork. huh?</i>

1297
01:24:29.934 --> 01:24:35.505
Everyone giving their own
special little part
of themselves to help find it.

1298
01:24:35.635 --> 01:24:38.247
Then they surely went
and changed the meaning on me.

1299
01:24:38.377 --> 01:24:39.552
- Oh!

1300
01:24:40.162 --> 01:24:41.511
- You hear that?
- Hear that?

1301
01:24:54.828 --> 01:24:56.526
- Oh!

1302
01:24:56.656 --> 01:24:59.616
- We did it!

1303
01:24:59.746 --> 01:25:01.966
- All right!
- Wow!

1304
01:25:02.793 --> 01:25:04.099
So much of it.

1305
01:25:06.623 --> 01:25:08.146
This is so pretty.

1306
01:25:09.452 --> 01:25:10.583
It's real.

1307
01:25:15.762 --> 01:25:17.460
It's a shame we can't keep it.

1308
01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:18.548
Wait. what?

1309
01:25:18.678 --> 01:25:20.941
No. we found it. it's ours.

1310
01:25:21.072 --> 01:25:25.772
No. he's right.
It belongs to the Sawyers
and the Harpers and the Rogers.

1311
01:25:26.382 --> 01:25:29.820
I think there will be
a generous finder's fee though.

1312
01:25:29.950 --> 01:25:32.388
-  Seriously?

1313
01:25:32.518 --> 01:25:35.173
Wait. what are we talking.
like fifty-fifty?

1314
01:25:36.218 --> 01:25:38.742
- We'll work something out.
- Hm.

1315
01:25:38.872 --> 01:25:41.701
<i>After the shares
were divvied out.</i>

1316
01:25:41.832 --> 01:25:45.618
they did what anyone
with the right constitution
would have done.

1317
01:25:45.749 --> 01:25:47.664
Went right ahead
and put it back <i>.</i>

1318
01:25:49.056 --> 01:25:50.797
Most of it. anyway.

1319
01:25:50.928 --> 01:25:53.713
<i>All so the next generation
of you thrill-seekers</i>

1320
01:25:53.844 --> 01:25:57.152
<i>could track down
the secret of that pirate gold
for yourselves.</i>

1321
01:25:57.282 --> 01:26:00.459
I think great-great-grandpa
Sawyer would be very proud.

1322
01:26:00.590 --> 01:26:01.765
Yeah?

1323
01:26:02.766 --> 01:26:04.202
<i>And. you know.</i>

1324
01:26:04.333 --> 01:26:07.074
I think Mr. Twain
would have approved too.

1325
01:26:08.032 --> 01:26:09.555
Hm. At the end of the day.

1326
01:26:10.426 --> 01:26:12.515
that's all he ever wanted.

1327
01:26:12.645 --> 01:26:16.345
<i>"A little more kindness.
a little less speed.</i>

1328
01:26:16.475 --> 01:26:20.523
<i>A little more giving.
a little less greed.</i>

1329
01:26:20.653 --> 01:26:24.962
<i>A little more smile.
a little less frown.</i>

1330
01:26:25.092 --> 01:26:29.009
<i>A little less kicking a man
while he's down.</i>

1331
01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:32.578
<i>A little more 'We'.
a little less 'I'.</i>

1332
01:26:32.709 --> 01:26:37.192
<i>A little more laugh.
a little less cry.</i>

1333
01:26:37.322 --> 01:26:41.761
<i>A little more flowers
on the pathway of life.</i>

1334
01:26:41.892 --> 01:26:45.200
<i>And fewer on graves
at the end of the strife."</i>
