00:02:14.886 --> 00:02:16.304
Tommy?

4
00:02:19.224 --> 00:02:21.768
Tommy. are you awake?

5
00:02:24.563 --> 00:02:26.690
I saw your missing boat outside.

6
00:02:29.276 --> 00:02:30.694
I'm gonna get it for you.

7
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.949
Mrs. Summers?

8
00:02:36.032 --> 00:02:37.993
Are you sure I should go?

9
00:02:38.076 --> 00:02:39.744
I don't mind staying.

10
00:02:39.828 --> 00:02:41.746
No. it's fine. You should go home.

11
00:02:42.414 --> 00:02:44.040
I'll check on the kids later.

12
00:02:44.124 --> 00:02:45.876
Okay. Mrs. Summers.

13
00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:47.335
I'll see you tomorrow.

14
00:03:08.315 --> 00:03:09.649
There you are.

15
00:04:03.036 --> 00:04:04.246
Rebecca?

16
00:04:05.497 --> 00:04:06.581
What are you doing?

17
00:04:18.593 --> 00:04:19.886
Sorry. Mom.

18
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.346
I didn't mean...

19
00:04:26.935 --> 00:04:28.228
Mom?

20
00:05:24.117 --> 00:05:26.244
<i>Temagami. Temagami.</i>

21
00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:28.747
<i>Temagami. Temagami...</i>

22
00:05:32.167 --> 00:05:34.628
Mom! Mom! Mom!

23
00:05:34.711 --> 00:05:36.254
Help!

24
00:06:00.737 --> 00:06:03.406
<i>Brewers played
extra innings with the Marlins yesterday.</i>

25
00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:04.491
<i>They fell in 12.</i>

26
00:06:04.574 --> 00:06:08.078
<i>One-one. Foul ball up the first baseline.
and it is two strikes.</i>

27
00:06:08.662 --> 00:06:12.123
<i>Brewers are eight and nine
in extra-inning games so far this season.</i>

28
00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:13.708
<i>Hoping to keep that streak alive.</i>

29
00:06:14.834 --> 00:06:16.378
Ray.  they're ready for us.

30
00:06:24.344 --> 00:06:25.637
Dad.

31
00:06:26.221 --> 00:06:27.430
You okay?

32
00:06:28.515 --> 00:06:31.226
Yeah. Yeah. I'm good.

33
00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:33.520
Give me a head start.
I'll meet you inside.

34
00:06:39.067 --> 00:06:41.111
This has got every single thing
that you asked for.

35
00:06:41.194 --> 00:06:43.446
It has 24-hour emergency call service.

36
00:06:44.072 --> 00:06:45.824
Right? Which is great.

37
00:06:45.907 --> 00:06:48.577
It's got single-level bedrooms.

38
00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.037
It's got bath...
All the bathrooms have handrails.

39
00:06:51.121 --> 00:06:52.914
And you're just minutes away

40
00:06:52.998 --> 00:06:55.834
from one of the best medical facilities
in the Twin Cities.

41
00:06:55.917 --> 00:06:56.918
Yeah.

42
00:06:57.043 --> 00:06:58.837
It's... I mean.
it's really kind of perfect lease

43
00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.755
for when you just need
a little extra help.

44
00:07:01.548 --> 00:07:02.883
Do you not like it?

45
00:07:02.966 --> 00:07:04.885
- Well. it's nice.
Are you... Are you looking

46
00:07:04.968 --> 00:07:06.720
for a place to throw the ball around?

47
00:07:07.929 --> 00:07:09.681
Is there any chance
that you're gonna bring

48
00:07:09.806 --> 00:07:12.517
that Waller swing here
once you get better?

49
00:07:14.603 --> 00:07:16.479
I'm sorry. I Google all my clients.

50
00:07:16.563 --> 00:07:18.732
and it's just not every day
that I get a...

51
00:07:18.815 --> 00:07:20.275
A big-league third baseman.

52
00:07:20.358 --> 00:07:21.818
Yeah. no. I. um...

53
00:07:22.444 --> 00:07:24.279
I'm just focused on getting better now

54
00:07:24.362 --> 00:07:25.864
and spending some time at home

55
00:07:25.947 --> 00:07:27.324
- and being with family.
- Well. you know what?

56
00:07:27.407 --> 00:07:29.868
You can spend some of that
baseball money right here.

57
00:07:29.951 --> 00:07:32.662
You can't put a price on peace of mind.

58
00:07:32.787 --> 00:07:35.332
Yeah. Yeah. well.
apparently. here you can.

59
00:07:35.457 --> 00:07:37.042
It's 4.200 bucks.

60
00:07:37.167 --> 00:07:40.420
Oh. just... You know what? In the kitchen.
Come here. I want to show you.

61
00:07:40.503 --> 00:07:41.963
There's this accessible design.

62
00:07:42.047 --> 00:07:44.633
And I don't know who did it.
but I think I want one myself.

63
00:07:44.716 --> 00:07:45.967
- I'll tell you that much.
You guys like it or...

64
00:07:46.051 --> 00:07:47.552
Yeah.
I might be your neighbor.

65
00:08:23.964 --> 00:08:25.423
Wait. wait. Honey. honey.

66
00:08:25.507 --> 00:08:26.758
- Wait. stop. stop.
- What?

67
00:08:26.841 --> 00:08:28.677
Honey. stop. stop. stop. Look.

68
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.303
Look. Look.

69
00:08:32.471 --> 00:08:33.723
Huh.

70
00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:35.725
I would've shown you this place.

71
00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:37.726
but it didn't really meet your checklist.

72
00:08:37.811 --> 00:08:39.854
- And this is not a rental. right?
- I know.

73
00:08:39.937 --> 00:08:41.773
- We were just curious.
- Okay.

74
00:08:41.855 --> 00:08:44.818
Right. well. it's only one owner
for the last couple decades.

75
00:08:44.901 --> 00:08:48.321
And. uh. you know.
it needs just a little work. I think.

76
00:08:48.405 --> 00:08:51.157
But it's not gonna be on the market
very long at this price.

77
00:08:51.283 --> 00:08:54.703
Oh. and you're in a great school district
with Harold Holt.

78
00:08:54.786 --> 00:08:56.121
That's where I start in the fall.

79
00:08:56.204 --> 00:08:58.456
No. really? Oh. I'm a proud alum myself.

80
00:08:58.540 --> 00:08:59.624
Go. Lake Trout.

81
00:09:01.585 --> 00:09:03.503
And what subject do you teach there?

82
00:09:03.628 --> 00:09:05.297
Oh. no. I'm just in the admin office

83
00:09:05.422 --> 00:09:08.258
while I finish my degree online
for special education.

84
00:09:09.342 --> 00:09:11.344
Oh. Good for you. Good for you.

85
00:09:11.428 --> 00:09:13.638
Well. it's never too late
to follow your dream.

86
00:09:14.222 --> 00:09:17.100
Too awesome.

87
00:09:17.642 --> 00:09:18.685
Yeah.

88
00:09:18.768 --> 00:09:21.771
Oh. my gosh. This is amazing.

89
00:09:21.897 --> 00:09:24.107
- What is that? The fruit baskets.

90
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.318
Where did Ray get off to?

91
00:09:26.443 --> 00:09:27.652
I didn't see him.

92
00:09:29.863 --> 00:09:31.239
There you are.

93
00:09:31.364 --> 00:09:32.866
Hey.

94
00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:34.367
There's a pool.

95
00:09:37.203 --> 00:09:38.872
I used to be scared of pools.

96
00:09:40.665 --> 00:09:43.501
My dad pushed me
into one of the training tanks

97
00:09:43.585 --> 00:09:45.545
at Fort Benning when I was three.

98
00:09:45.629 --> 00:09:46.755
Mm-hmm.

99
00:09:46.838 --> 00:09:48.506
Sink or swim.

100
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:50.091
I guess I swam.

101
00:09:52.177 --> 00:09:53.511
I always wanted a pool.

102
00:09:54.679 --> 00:09:56.806
When we were kids.
we used to go down the street.

103
00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:59.184
break into the KOA. go swimming.

104
00:09:59.351 --> 00:10:02.270
We used to pretend that
we were the rich kids from the suburbs.

105
00:10:03.897 --> 00:10:05.690
Hey. Mom. can we get lunch?

106
00:10:05.774 --> 00:10:07.859
Yeah. I'm ready to go.
Can we get some food?

107
00:10:07.943 --> 00:10:09.110
Come on. old man.

108
00:10:10.028 --> 00:10:11.571
Before we get too nostalgic.

109
00:10:45.021 --> 00:10:47.566
<i>Familiar face
makes his way down to the plate.</i>

110
00:10:47.649 --> 00:10:49.526
<i>What a story this has been. folks.</i>

111
00:10:50.026 --> 00:10:51.778
<i>After a year battling illness.</i>

112
00:10:51.861 --> 00:10:53.780
<i>Ray Waller is trying to do the impossible</i>

113
00:10:53.863 --> 00:10:55.824
<i>with a Major League comeback.</i>

114
00:10:57.534 --> 00:10:58.577
<i>Glider inside.</i>

115
00:10:58.660 --> 00:10:59.869
<i>Waller digs for it...</i>

116
00:11:01.329 --> 00:11:03.081
<i>- and connects!</i>

117
00:11:03.164 --> 00:11:05.208
<i>It's a deep ball into far center field.</i>

118
00:11:05.292 --> 00:11:06.960
<i>and it is gone!</i>

119
00:11:21.766 --> 00:11:22.934
Dad!

120
00:11:23.059 --> 00:11:24.978
Mom. hurry! Dad fell in!

121
00:11:26.563 --> 00:11:28.815
Ray. what happened? Are you okay?

122
00:11:28.899 --> 00:11:30.567
- Dad? What happened?
Yeah.

123
00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:31.735
Mom. is he okay?

124
00:11:31.818 --> 00:11:33.737
- Just breathe. It's okay.
-  I'm fine.

125
00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.280
- Mom. his cane.
- Yep.

126
00:11:35.363 --> 00:11:37.616
- Izzy. give me... Help me here.
- Yep.

127
00:11:37.699 --> 00:11:38.992
- Yeah.
You got it?

128
00:11:39.492 --> 00:11:40.660
Okay.

129
00:11:42.704 --> 00:11:43.747
- You got it?
Okay.

130
00:11:43.872 --> 00:11:45.832
Yeah?
Yeah. Okay.

131
00:11:55.217 --> 00:11:58.011
How long has it been
since your last episode?

132
00:11:58.094 --> 00:11:59.971
Well. it wasn't really an episode.

133
00:12:00.055 --> 00:12:01.348
- I don't think. It's like...

134
00:12:01.473 --> 00:12:03.308
At spring training about six months ago.

135
00:12:03.808 --> 00:12:08.355
My recommendation
is to escalate the diagnosis

136
00:12:08.438 --> 00:12:11.024
to secondary progressive MS.

137
00:12:11.107 --> 00:12:13.693
No. but the doctor said he was stabilizing

138
00:12:13.777 --> 00:12:16.196
and that it's about managing now.

139
00:12:16.279 --> 00:12:19.115
It's better to have
a more accurate diagnosis.

140
00:12:19.616 --> 00:12:20.992
- Are you in PT?
- No...

141
00:12:21.076 --> 00:12:23.370
Um. well. I mean.
I'm throwing the ball around

142
00:12:23.453 --> 00:12:25.163
in the front yard with the kids.
and. like. that.

143
00:12:25.247 --> 00:12:27.958
We just got insurance
through the school where I'm working.

144
00:12:28.041 --> 00:12:29.501
Yeah.
- Forget baseball.

145
00:12:29.584 --> 00:12:32.837
For now. we need to find
a low-impact activity

146
00:12:32.921 --> 00:12:34.297
that you can do every day.

147
00:12:34.381 --> 00:12:36.466
Walking. yoga.

148
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:39.386
Most therapists recommend swimming.

149
00:12:39.469 --> 00:12:41.721
Look. I know it feels like
your whole world

150
00:12:41.805 --> 00:12:43.265
is turning upside down.

151
00:12:44.391 --> 00:12:46.851
It's going to take sacrifice
from you both.

152
00:12:46.935 --> 00:12:49.229
but you can build a good life together.

153
00:12:49.312 --> 00:12:51.815
First. you have to let go of the old one.

154
00:12:53.358 --> 00:12:56.486
Use the wheelchair for the next few days
while you regulate.

155
00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:58.738
and I will bring you back in next week.

156
00:13:03.577 --> 00:13:06.830
Honey. if we rent that townhome.
it'd be like living in a hospital.

157
00:13:10.417 --> 00:13:12.085
I don't want to be the sick guy anymore.

158
00:13:12.168 --> 00:13:13.378
But you're sick. Ray.

159
00:13:13.503 --> 00:13:15.255
- We need to deal with that head-on.
- I know. I just don't want it

160
00:13:15.338 --> 00:13:17.257
to define our whole life now.

161
00:13:19.593 --> 00:13:21.219
What about that other house?

162
00:13:22.053 --> 00:13:25.056
The kids will love it. with all that room.

163
00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:26.182
And with a swimming pool.

164
00:13:26.266 --> 00:13:29.185
we'll have water therapy
in our own backyard.

165
00:13:40.697 --> 00:13:42.908
You know I want our own place.

166
00:13:43.825 --> 00:13:46.828
I'm tired of the kids changing schools.

167
00:13:46.912 --> 00:13:49.706
making new friends
every time you get traded.

168
00:13:50.624 --> 00:13:53.877
I want us to put down roots. you know?

169
00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:58.006
I just need to know
that you want that. too.

170
00:13:58.089 --> 00:13:59.090
I do.

171
00:14:00.425 --> 00:14:01.468
Eve.

172
00:14:04.721 --> 00:14:06.223
I want that. too.

173
00:14:07.432 --> 00:14:08.642
I promise.

174
00:14:11.686 --> 00:14:14.189
Also. you know what else
I was wondering about?

175
00:14:14.314 --> 00:14:17.943
Do you have that black bikini still?

176
00:14:18.026 --> 00:14:19.277
You know which one I'm talking about?

177
00:14:19.361 --> 00:14:20.820
- With the crisscross straps?
- Guy's in a hospital.

178
00:14:20.904 --> 00:14:22.364
This is what he's thinking.

179
00:14:22.864 --> 00:14:25.575
<i>This summer I went swimming</i>

180
00:14:25.659 --> 00:14:27.994
<i>This summer I might have drowned</i>

181
00:14:28.078 --> 00:14:30.747
<i>But I held my breath and I kicked my feet</i>

182
00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:33.458
<i>And I moved my arms around</i>

183
00:14:33.541 --> 00:14:34.751
<i>I moved my arms around...</i>

184
00:14:34.834 --> 00:14:37.045
Hey. there you are. Cider.

185
00:14:37.128 --> 00:14:38.421
Come here. buddy.

186
00:14:38.922 --> 00:14:40.382
How do you like our new home?

187
00:14:40.465 --> 00:14:42.842
Isn't it awesome? It's so big. right?

188
00:14:42.926 --> 00:14:45.303
<i>Chlorine my eyes.
I'm a self-destructive fool...</i>

189
00:14:45.387 --> 00:14:46.930
Izzy. I'll see you later.
Okay.

190
00:14:47.013 --> 00:14:48.682
Good luck.
- Thanks.

191
00:14:48.765 --> 00:14:49.808
You got it.
- Yeah.

192
00:14:49.891 --> 00:14:51.685
Oh. wait. wait. wait.
- What?

193
00:14:51.768 --> 00:14:53.019
Oh. thanks.

194
00:14:53.144 --> 00:14:55.021
- See you later. dipshit.
See you. barf bag.

195
00:14:55.981 --> 00:14:57.357
Think you're gonna go out this year?

196
00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.443
Yeah. Dad says
I'm about to hit my growth spurt.

197
00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.446
Actually. wait.

198
00:15:04.197 --> 00:15:06.449
Yeah. I think you're hitting it right now.

199
00:15:08.868 --> 00:15:11.079
Here. Wait. wait. I got it.

200
00:15:12.247 --> 00:15:14.624
<i>The old Australian crawl</i>

201
00:15:14.708 --> 00:15:17.252
<i>This summer I went swimming</i>

202
00:15:17.377 --> 00:15:18.670
<i>This summer I might have drowned...</i>

203
00:15:18.753 --> 00:15:20.505
Hey. how tall are you?

204
00:15:21.506 --> 00:15:22.507
Look. um...

205
00:15:22.591 --> 00:15:24.175
Can you just put your arm up real quick?

206
00:15:24.259 --> 00:15:26.553
Like. yeah. Just like that.

207
00:15:26.636 --> 00:15:27.971
Yeah. you have a great wingspan.

208
00:15:29.222 --> 00:15:30.223
Thanks.

209
00:15:30.307 --> 00:15:31.516
You should come on Friday.

210
00:15:32.642 --> 00:15:34.644
- Okay.
- My name's Ronin.

211
00:15:35.186 --> 00:15:37.939
Hey. you should come on Friday.
for real. It's gonna be dope.

212
00:15:39.649 --> 00:15:42.819
<i>Hey-ee!</i>

213
00:15:56.166 --> 00:15:57.918
Does it smell weird to you guys?

214
00:15:58.043 --> 00:15:59.961
Nah. you're just
turning back into a dog.

215
00:16:00.045 --> 00:16:02.172
Have to take you back to the shelter
where Mom and Dad found you.

216
00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:06.551
What is with the PYX 106 playlist?

217
00:16:06.635 --> 00:16:08.178
I'm bringing back the classics. babe.

218
00:16:08.261 --> 00:16:10.388
I like it. Dad.
Hey. El. I...

219
00:16:11.056 --> 00:16:12.849
I talked with your coach at orientation.

220
00:16:12.933 --> 00:16:16.394
He thought it might be good
if I come and help with practice.

221
00:16:16.478 --> 00:16:18.230
I thought it might be kinda fun. right?

222
00:16:18.313 --> 00:16:19.898
Yeah. Dad. This is my year. right?

223
00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.691
Yeah.

224
00:16:21.775 --> 00:16:22.901
It is.

225
00:16:23.401 --> 00:16:25.153
I think I'm going out for the swim team.

226
00:16:25.779 --> 00:16:26.821
Ooh!
Really?

227
00:16:26.947 --> 00:16:28.782
Yeah.
That's great. Iz.

228
00:16:28.907 --> 00:16:30.492
- Yeah. you're gonna be a natural.

229
00:16:30.575 --> 00:16:33.620
That trophy bat. that came alive
the day you were born.

230
00:16:33.703 --> 00:16:34.788
Mm-hmm.

231
00:16:34.871 --> 00:16:38.333
I absolutely launched one into the Bay.

232
00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:39.793
Pop!

233
00:16:39.876 --> 00:16:41.002
Splash.

234
00:16:41.086 --> 00:16:43.797
It was the ninth inning.
and I was at the plate.

235
00:16:45.048 --> 00:16:46.049
and I don't know what it was.

236
00:16:46.883 --> 00:16:49.135
Just this sense of strength came over me.

237
00:16:50.053 --> 00:16:51.471
I knew it.

238
00:16:51.555 --> 00:16:52.931
I knew it right then.

239
00:16:53.056 --> 00:16:54.683
- My Izzy is...

240
00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.142
Dad?

241
00:16:56.226 --> 00:16:57.811
- Oh. my gosh.
What happened?

242
00:16:57.936 --> 00:16:59.104
- Ray?
Are you okay?

243
00:16:59.229 --> 00:17:00.689
God. I sliced it pretty good.
- What happened?

244
00:17:00.772 --> 00:17:01.982
- Ah...
- Oh. that looks...

245
00:17:02.065 --> 00:17:03.233
Oh. God.

246
00:17:03.942 --> 00:17:05.610
- Oh. my gosh.
Ew.

247
00:17:05.694 --> 00:17:07.028
- What is that?
Oh. God.

248
00:17:07.111 --> 00:17:08.196
Be careful.

249
00:17:09.948 --> 00:17:11.283
Is that supposed to happen?

250
00:17:11.366 --> 00:17:12.449
I don't think so.

251
00:17:13.201 --> 00:17:14.202
<i>Is it safe?</i>

252
00:17:14.285 --> 00:17:16.454
No pool is absolutely safe.

253
00:17:16.538 --> 00:17:18.039
But you see that cap?

254
00:17:18.122 --> 00:17:19.457
That's a wellhead.

255
00:17:20.041 --> 00:17:24.545
I-I've never seen an actual
spring-fed pool before in person.

256
00:17:24.629 --> 00:17:26.172
but you're tapped into groundwater.

257
00:17:26.256 --> 00:17:27.883
- I'm talking aquiclude.

258
00:17:28.008 --> 00:17:30.385
That's some sublevel aquifer shit.

259
00:17:30.468 --> 00:17:31.887
What does that mean?
- Yeah. what does that mean?

260
00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:33.263
I'm about to tell you what that means.

261
00:17:33.388 --> 00:17:35.599
That means natural filtration.

262
00:17:35.682 --> 00:17:38.602
geothermal heating. the whole shebang.

263
00:17:38.727 --> 00:17:41.479
Yeah. we'll give it a shock.
but these spring pools

264
00:17:41.563 --> 00:17:43.523
are supposed to work miracles
on your skin.

265
00:17:43.648 --> 00:17:45.901
This whole area
had natural pools all around.

266
00:17:45.984 --> 00:17:47.903
Wellness centers. health spas.

267
00:17:48.028 --> 00:17:49.529
That's great. Lucky us. huh?

268
00:17:49.654 --> 00:17:50.780
Yeah.

269
00:17:50.864 --> 00:17:52.741
- It's funny. isn't it. though?
- Uh-huh.

270
00:17:52.824 --> 00:17:54.034
I mean...

271
00:17:54.784 --> 00:17:57.037
We evolved out of the water

272
00:17:57.162 --> 00:17:59.748
and some part of our reptilian brain knows

273
00:17:59.873 --> 00:18:03.168
we're not supposed to be there
anymore. but...

274
00:18:03.668 --> 00:18:06.671
I guess that's why
we try to tame it so hard.

275
00:18:08.465 --> 00:18:10.967
It's like trying to conquer death...

276
00:18:11.051 --> 00:18:12.052
- Whoa. whoa.
Jesus. Be careful.

277
00:18:12.135 --> 00:18:14.554
Are you okay?
- God. sorry.

278
00:18:14.679 --> 00:18:15.764
Butterfingers.

279
00:18:16.598 --> 00:18:17.599
What an idiot.

280
00:18:17.682 --> 00:18:19.434
All right. well. here's your invoice.

281
00:18:20.101 --> 00:18:21.186
I'll come back tomorrow.

282
00:18:21.269 --> 00:18:23.021
You should be set up by next week.

283
00:18:23.146 --> 00:18:24.898
- Okay.
- Great. Thanks.

284
00:18:24.981 --> 00:18:26.566
Hey. Gecko. let's wrap it up.

285
00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:28.193
Come on. Let's boogie. baby.

286
00:18:31.863 --> 00:18:33.823
All right. we're good to go!

287
00:18:46.962 --> 00:18:48.129
Ready?

288
00:18:48.213 --> 00:18:49.214
Yeah.

289
00:18:49.297 --> 00:18:52.425
<i>One life. I'm gonna live it up...</i>

290
00:19:03.603 --> 00:19:05.397
Come on. Dad. Throw some more.

291
00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.233
Hold on. I just got to finish
these exercises.

292
00:19:09.568 --> 00:19:10.944
Are you watching this?

293
00:19:11.027 --> 00:19:13.947
The water takes all
the strain off my muscles. It's amazing.

294
00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:15.907
Give me those muscles.

295
00:19:19.661 --> 00:19:20.996
They're all down there.

296
00:19:21.121 --> 00:19:22.455
I'll get 'em all in one breath.

297
00:19:23.248 --> 00:19:25.375
Yeah. sure. Why not? Go.

298
00:19:27.335 --> 00:19:28.587
Are you ready?

299
00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:30.213
You know. this is. um...

300
00:19:30.338 --> 00:19:32.549
It's gonna sound crazy.
but I think that maybe getting sick

301
00:19:32.632 --> 00:19:34.134
happened for a reason. you know?

302
00:19:35.385 --> 00:19:37.262
I don't think
I could've walked away healthy.

303
00:19:37.387 --> 00:19:38.430
Look. right here.

304
00:19:39.055 --> 00:19:41.016
You'll always be a baseball player.

305
00:19:41.141 --> 00:19:42.475
I got it fair and square.

306
00:19:42.601 --> 00:19:43.852
But it's not all you are.

307
00:19:45.186 --> 00:19:47.063
It's not why I fell in love with you.

308
00:19:47.188 --> 00:19:48.773
- No?
- No.

309
00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.151
Don't look back.

310
00:19:52.277 --> 00:19:53.486
Remember?

311
00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:54.905
This is all we need.

312
00:19:56.239 --> 00:19:58.158
- Right?
- Yeah.

313
00:19:59.576 --> 00:20:00.827
Yeah.

314
00:20:05.498 --> 00:20:06.750
You know my kiss is magic?

315
00:20:06.833 --> 00:20:07.834
Oh. really?

316
00:20:07.918 --> 00:20:09.544
Yep. If we kiss. you'll be healed.

317
00:20:09.628 --> 00:20:10.712
Wow.

318
00:20:12.631 --> 00:20:13.965
Ew. guys.

319
00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:16.134
You know we're here. right?

320
00:20:16.218 --> 00:20:17.219
Okay.

321
00:20:17.302 --> 00:20:18.303
"Oh. I love you so much."
All right.

322
00:20:18.386 --> 00:20:19.387
- Ruined it.
- Done.

323
00:20:19.471 --> 00:20:20.639
- You ruined the moment.

324
00:20:20.722 --> 00:20:21.723
Now you're gonna pay.

325
00:20:21.806 --> 00:20:24.017
So cringe.
- No. Dad. Don't do it. don't do it.

326
00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:25.393
- Please. no.
Could you at least wait

327
00:20:25.477 --> 00:20:27.562
- until we're gone?
No.

328
00:20:28.688 --> 00:20:30.273
<i>It's comin' now...</i>

329
00:20:30.357 --> 00:20:31.358
Dad?

330
00:20:31.441 --> 00:20:33.360
- Dad. no! Please. no!

331
00:21:10.355 --> 00:21:11.481
<i>You can't catch us.</i>

332
00:21:11.565 --> 00:21:13.900
<i>You can't catch us! You can't catch us!</i>

333
00:21:13.984 --> 00:21:15.151
<i>Elliot's mine!</i>

334
00:21:16.611 --> 00:21:18.530
Don't let him go.
- Come on! You can't catch us!

335
00:21:18.613 --> 00:21:22.826
<i>Teachers need to implement
backdoor strategies</i>

336
00:21:22.909 --> 00:21:26.246
<i>because students with ADHD
and deeply feeling kids</i>

337
00:21:26.329 --> 00:21:29.499
<i>can be easily overwhelmed
by sensory stimulation.</i>

338
00:21:29.583 --> 00:21:33.211
{\an8}<i>and they may shut down
when emotionally dysregulated.</i>

339
00:21:34.754 --> 00:21:36.840
<i>Kids who are struggling with anxiety</i>

340
00:21:36.923 --> 00:21:38.842
<i>- and in-class performance...</i>

341
00:21:38.925 --> 00:21:41.177
<i>- ...they're inclined to...</i>

342
00:22:03.992 --> 00:22:05.619
Hey. what's the matter?

343
00:22:07.954 --> 00:22:09.289
Huh?

344
00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:13.001
You don't want to swim? Hmm?

345
00:22:16.338 --> 00:22:17.756
Pussy.

346
00:22:57.796 --> 00:22:59.631
Ray. you scared me.

347
00:24:04.946 --> 00:24:07.073
<i>His 27th home run this season.</i>

348
00:24:07.157 --> 00:24:09.159
<i>and the crowd is fully back in the game.</i>

349
00:24:09.242 --> 00:24:12.871
<i>So many times. we talk about how momentum
can change with one swing of the bat.</i>

350
00:24:12.996 --> 00:24:14.414
<i>One pitch. one play...</i>

351
00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:22.923
You're all wet.

352
00:24:24.674 --> 00:24:26.509
Were you outside a minute ago?

353
00:24:27.636 --> 00:24:28.970
No.

354
00:24:29.054 --> 00:24:31.890
I think I just fell asleep.

355
00:24:34.976 --> 00:24:38.313
I think we should put in a pool cover
just to be safe.

356
00:24:39.564 --> 00:24:41.816
And we need to check out the lights.

357
00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.069
Yeah... Yeah. for sure.

358
00:24:45.153 --> 00:24:46.696
Everything okay?

359
00:24:47.113 --> 00:24:49.866
Yeah. Yeah. Go back to sleep.

360
00:25:22.649 --> 00:25:24.025
<i>Mom! Dad!</i>

361
00:25:24.109 --> 00:25:25.569
Come look!

362
00:25:26.653 --> 00:25:28.822
He probably fell in and got scared.

363
00:25:30.991 --> 00:25:33.326
Well. he... He'll come back
when he's hungry. huh?

364
00:25:34.202 --> 00:25:35.495
We have to find him.

365
00:25:36.037 --> 00:25:38.248
Yeah. that's... We'll go look for him.

366
00:25:38.331 --> 00:25:39.833
We'll find him.

367
00:25:39.916 --> 00:25:41.668
It's okay. Ellie. He'll come back.

368
00:25:41.751 --> 00:25:43.962
Pshh-pshh-pshh-pshh-pshh-pshh-pshh!

369
00:25:44.629 --> 00:25:46.548
- Cider.
Come here. Cider.

370
00:25:46.631 --> 00:25:47.883
Come on. puss.

371
00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.468
Cider. where'd you go?

372
00:25:51.094 --> 00:25:52.220
Cider?

373
00:25:52.888 --> 00:25:55.223
Izzy. did you look down there?

374
00:25:55.307 --> 00:25:57.058
No. I didn't check there.

375
00:25:57.183 --> 00:25:58.184
Here. puss.

376
00:25:58.268 --> 00:25:59.686
Maybe he's up in this tree?

377
00:26:01.187 --> 00:26:02.564
Come here. Cider.

378
00:26:02.647 --> 00:26:03.773
Cider.

379
00:26:04.816 --> 00:26:05.859
Cider!

380
00:26:07.527 --> 00:26:09.321
You guys looked inside the house?

381
00:26:10.238 --> 00:26:11.573
Yeah.
Come here. buddy!

382
00:26:11.656 --> 00:26:13.783
Not upstairs. though.
Did you look upstairs?

383
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:16.328
Again? I promise you.
I already checked upstairs.

384
00:26:19.998 --> 00:26:21.499
Cider!

385
00:26:23.001 --> 00:26:24.419
Here. Cider.

386
00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:27.297
Come on. Cider.

387
00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:30.383
Cider!

388
00:26:34.346 --> 00:26:35.805
Cider.

389
00:26:40.227 --> 00:26:41.436
Cider.

390
00:26:43.438 --> 00:26:44.481
Want some food?

391
00:26:48.401 --> 00:26:49.736
Come on. Cider.

392
00:26:55.951 --> 00:26:57.535
Come on. put your back into it.

393
00:26:57.619 --> 00:26:59.037
We gotta roll it up. make it tight.

394
00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.164
so when we roll it back out.
it's all clean and nice.

395
00:27:01.248 --> 00:27:02.791
Keep cranking. One turn at a time.

396
00:27:02.874 --> 00:27:04.709
I'm trying.
- Come on.

397
00:27:04.793 --> 00:27:06.545
Keep going. You strike out.
you keep going.

398
00:27:06.628 --> 00:27:07.963
Isn't that right? Yeah.

399
00:27:08.046 --> 00:27:09.589
- Don't give up. That's the key.

400
00:27:09.673 --> 00:27:11.925
That's the only thing that matters.
Let's go. come on.

401
00:27:12.008 --> 00:27:13.927
Good job. Little wins.

402
00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:15.303
Here we go. Come on.

403
00:27:15.387 --> 00:27:17.389
Be nice to your brother right now.

404
00:27:18.598 --> 00:27:20.475
None of this has been easy on him.

405
00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:23.728
Keep going. keep going. Good job.

406
00:27:24.271 --> 00:27:25.480
There you go. See?

407
00:27:25.605 --> 00:27:27.607
I know it hasn't been easy on you. either.

408
00:27:29.734 --> 00:27:31.528
Oh. no. Baby. I'm fine.

409
00:27:31.611 --> 00:27:33.238
I don't want you worrying about me.

410
00:28:04.394 --> 00:28:05.729
What is that?

411
00:29:07.916 --> 00:29:10.794
Um. s... What... What is it?

412
00:29:15.298 --> 00:29:18.760
I've never seen
such a dramatic improvement

413
00:29:18.843 --> 00:29:20.720
in such a short time.

414
00:29:20.845 --> 00:29:23.056
We need to do more tests.

415
00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:27.185
but it appears there are no new lesions

416
00:29:28.353 --> 00:29:30.188
and the white tissue
is actually improving.

417
00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:33.567
We started the new diet like you said.

418
00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:35.735
and the water therapy and...

419
00:29:35.819 --> 00:29:37.153
Twice a day.

420
00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:39.864
We have a pool.

421
00:29:55.714 --> 00:29:58.383
Hey. Mom.
I finished all my work in study hall.

422
00:29:58.466 --> 00:29:59.467
Can I go swimming?

423
00:29:59.551 --> 00:30:01.553
Okay. but don't go alone.
Ask your dad.

424
00:30:08.351 --> 00:30:10.687
<i>Here's progress report. I. uh...</i>

425
00:30:11.313 --> 00:30:14.274
<i>You all know I was diagnosed with MS
not too long ago.</i>

426
00:30:14.357 --> 00:30:15.817
<i>a little while back.</i>

427
00:30:15.901 --> 00:30:18.612
- Dad?
<i>- I've been able to work out in rehab</i>

428
00:30:18.695 --> 00:30:21.364
<i>and been getting back at it
for the last little while</i>

429
00:30:21.448 --> 00:30:24.284
<i>and I've made a lot of strides
that I'm proud of.</i>

430
00:30:24.367 --> 00:30:26.244
<i>I think that I can show you.</i>

431
00:30:26.328 --> 00:30:28.830
<i>demonstrate my ability
is still at a level that</i>

432
00:30:28.914 --> 00:30:31.708
<i>I'd be able to make an impact
on a team rather quickly.</i>

433
00:30:31.791 --> 00:30:32.918
Hey. pal.

434
00:30:35.045 --> 00:30:36.463
Can you help me out with something?

435
00:30:37.631 --> 00:30:38.632
Yeah.

436
00:30:39.174 --> 00:30:40.675
Can you throw on a 25?

437
00:30:50.435 --> 00:30:52.187
What are you doing with the camera?

438
00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:54.522
Helps me with my training.

439
00:31:09.955 --> 00:31:11.873
Can you dive for coins with me?

440
00:31:11.957 --> 00:31:13.583
Mom says I can't swim alone.

441
00:31:18.547 --> 00:31:19.756
Yeah. um...

442
00:31:21.424 --> 00:31:22.759
Uh...

443
00:31:24.302 --> 00:31:26.513
Yeah. Hey. hand me one of those coins.

444
00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:31.643
Here.

445
00:31:34.396 --> 00:31:36.064
You gotta promise me

446
00:31:36.147 --> 00:31:37.983
you're gonna stay
in the shallow end. Okay?

447
00:31:38.066 --> 00:31:39.192
Okay.

448
00:31:39.317 --> 00:31:40.652
Throw this one in the pool for me.

449
00:31:42.404 --> 00:31:44.698
And I'll come find it. Okay?

450
00:31:45.365 --> 00:31:46.449
All right.

451
00:32:30.785 --> 00:32:32.037
Hey. Dad.

452
00:33:30.136 --> 00:33:31.221
Hello?

453
00:33:41.439 --> 00:33:42.857
I got 'em all in one breath.

454
00:33:52.742 --> 00:33:55.579
Izzy? It's not funny.

455
00:33:59.583 --> 00:34:00.584
Izzy?

456
00:34:03.837 --> 00:34:05.171
I know that's you.

457
00:34:09.259 --> 00:34:10.468
I'm keeping the money.

458
00:34:15.265 --> 00:34:17.475
Okay. I'm going under.

459
00:35:05.941 --> 00:35:07.234
Hello?

460
00:35:12.572 --> 00:35:13.907
Can you hear me?

461
00:35:18.286 --> 00:35:19.704
I need help.

462
00:35:24.709 --> 00:35:26.503
I'm looking for my mom.

463
00:35:28.463 --> 00:35:29.881
Who are you?

464
00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:33.051
My name is Rebecca Summers.

465
00:35:36.888 --> 00:35:38.723
I found your  toy.

466
00:36:06.835 --> 00:36:08.753
Let go of me!

467
00:36:14.217 --> 00:36:15.552
Help!

468
00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:25.103
Mom.

469
00:36:27.522 --> 00:36:28.940
Is someone out here?

470
00:36:35.238 --> 00:36:36.615
Ellie. are you sure?

471
00:36:36.698 --> 00:36:37.991
Her name is Rebecca.

472
00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:41.036
She said she was looking for her mom.

473
00:37:06.478 --> 00:37:10.232
It was probably just a kid
who snuck over the gate. That's all.

474
00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:12.525
Anyway. we have a lock on it now. so...

475
00:37:12.609 --> 00:37:14.444
I didn't see anyone out there.

476
00:37:15.528 --> 00:37:17.239
Maybe he's pretending.

477
00:37:18.073 --> 00:37:19.950
'Cause he doesn't have
any real friends yet.

478
00:37:20.033 --> 00:37:22.994
Remember he talked to that pet gecko
or lizard. or whatever?

479
00:37:23.078 --> 00:37:24.079
He was five.

480
00:37:24.162 --> 00:37:26.248
Yeah. but he talked to him
for months after he died.

481
00:37:26.331 --> 00:37:28.458
He's gonna make friends. He just...

482
00:37:28.541 --> 00:37:30.293
It just takes him time.

483
00:37:30.794 --> 00:37:34.256
Yeah. I'm going to
his practice later today.

484
00:37:35.257 --> 00:37:38.176
So. maybe that'll help. like.
break the ice with the kids.

485
00:37:38.718 --> 00:37:39.803
Yeah.

486
00:37:40.428 --> 00:37:42.681
You should come.
'cause he always plays better

487
00:37:42.764 --> 00:37:44.266
when you're there. He's more himself.

488
00:37:46.351 --> 00:37:47.519
Hmm.

489
00:37:48.937 --> 00:37:51.064
Maybe we should have the team over.

490
00:37:51.147 --> 00:37:53.608
- You know. for a cookout or something?
- Yes.

491
00:37:53.692 --> 00:37:54.776
That's a great idea.

492
00:37:54.859 --> 00:37:56.361
- Yeah?
- Yeah. like a pool party.

493
00:37:56.444 --> 00:37:58.863
That's why I married you.
because you're a genius.

494
00:37:58.947 --> 00:38:00.532
Invite your coworkers. friends. whoever.

495
00:38:00.657 --> 00:38:02.409
- Just "Meet the Wallers." right?
- Mm-hmm.

496
00:38:02.492 --> 00:38:03.743
Sounds great.
Can I invite some friends?

497
00:38:03.827 --> 00:38:05.996
Yes. invite whoever you want.
It's a great idea.

498
00:38:06.079 --> 00:38:07.289
We should invite everybody you know.

499
00:38:07.372 --> 00:38:08.498
- We're a welcoming family.
Stop.

500
00:38:08.582 --> 00:38:10.208
How many people you think
we can fit in the pool?

501
00:38:10.292 --> 00:38:11.459
We're the pool family now.

502
00:38:13.169 --> 00:38:14.379
All right. Get in front of it.

503
00:38:15.088 --> 00:38:16.631
Good. Move it around.

504
00:38:16.715 --> 00:38:18.216
There you go. in front of it.
in front of it.

505
00:38:19.092 --> 00:38:20.677
It's all right. It's all right.

506
00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.095
Get in front of it. In front of it.

507
00:38:23.638 --> 00:38:25.515
Come on. wake up. man.

508
00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:27.309
Let's hustle. Let's hustle. boys.

509
00:38:27.392 --> 00:38:29.352
You know what baseball is. right?

510
00:38:30.604 --> 00:38:33.106
It's a stick and a ball

511
00:38:33.189 --> 00:38:35.609
and a bunch of guys wearing long socks.

512
00:38:38.111 --> 00:38:39.321
It's play.

513
00:38:40.363 --> 00:38:42.782
How come it's so easy for Dad and Izzy?

514
00:38:42.866 --> 00:38:44.200
It's not.

515
00:38:45.577 --> 00:38:47.579
Everyone's scared of something.

516
00:38:48.121 --> 00:38:50.749
Izzy used to hate drop-off
in kindergarten.

517
00:38:51.541 --> 00:38:53.877
Every day. I'd wait outside
until I saw her

518
00:38:54.002 --> 00:38:56.338
in the classroom window.
and she'd give me the signal.

519
00:38:57.047 --> 00:38:58.465
- Show him. Iz.
There we go!

520
00:38:58.632 --> 00:39:00.217
Good job. good job.

521
00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.136
Green light to swing.

522
00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:04.346
Wait for the ball. boys!

523
00:39:04.429 --> 00:39:05.722
Come on. come on!

524
00:39:05.805 --> 00:39:07.807
- Hey. there he is.
Hey. Coach. Sorry I'm late.

525
00:39:08.391 --> 00:39:10.143
- Hey. guys.
Hey.

526
00:39:10.227 --> 00:39:11.228
All right.

527
00:39:11.895 --> 00:39:13.355
You got this.

528
00:39:14.105 --> 00:39:16.191
Hey. boys. this is Elliot's dad.

529
00:39:16.274 --> 00:39:18.318
He's a former Brewers third baseman.

530
00:39:18.401 --> 00:39:20.320
and he's here to turn you
into all-star hitters.

531
00:39:21.321 --> 00:39:23.490
You got this. You got this. Nice and easy.

532
00:39:26.034 --> 00:39:28.328
You gotta follow through the ball.
Don't just. like. check swing.

533
00:39:29.204 --> 00:39:30.914
- There you go.
- Yes! Nice!

534
00:39:30.997 --> 00:39:32.707
All right. Line drive up the middle.
There you go.

535
00:39:32.791 --> 00:39:34.084
All right. move it around. move it around.

536
00:39:34.167 --> 00:39:36.044
You're bent way over
at the waist. right?

537
00:39:36.169 --> 00:39:37.420
And you turn out with your body.

538
00:39:37.504 --> 00:39:39.464
Don't hit it with your hands.
You turn out with your body.

539
00:39:39.548 --> 00:39:40.840
- All right. Good job.
There you go!

540
00:39:40.924 --> 00:39:42.259
Way to get on top of it. Good job.

541
00:39:42.342 --> 00:39:44.386
Oh. hey. Ray. that's my son. Ty.

542
00:39:44.511 --> 00:39:46.263
Yeah. keep an eye.
He's got good mechanics.

543
00:39:46.346 --> 00:39:47.931
All right. Ty.
Let's see what you got.

544
00:39:49.558 --> 00:39:50.850
- There you go.

545
00:39:50.934 --> 00:39:52.435
Yes. Ty! Yes!

546
00:39:52.769 --> 00:39:54.604
- Good swing. Good hit.
Yeah. I got you. Dad.

547
00:39:54.729 --> 00:39:56.231
- Good job.
Thanks. Mr. Waller.

548
00:39:56.314 --> 00:39:57.482
All right. El. you ready?

549
00:39:58.441 --> 00:39:59.526
Go. Ellie!

550
00:39:59.609 --> 00:40:01.194
All right. let's go.
Hey. Good luck out there. man.

551
00:40:01.278 --> 00:40:02.404
You got this.

552
00:40:02.487 --> 00:40:04.781
Way to go. Good job. Ty.

553
00:40:04.864 --> 00:40:06.283
Hey. Ellie.

554
00:40:12.122 --> 00:40:13.707
All right. Elliot.

555
00:40:14.332 --> 00:40:15.750
All right. come on. You got this.

556
00:40:16.585 --> 00:40:17.836
You got it. Elliot.

557
00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:20.130
- There you go. Nice!
Nice going.

558
00:40:20.213 --> 00:40:22.507
- There you go. All right. Good job.

559
00:40:22.591 --> 00:40:24.175
- Yes. Elliot.
All right.

560
00:40:24.301 --> 00:40:25.552
That's what stepping into the ball does.

561
00:40:25.677 --> 00:40:26.720
You go after it and you get it.

562
00:40:26.803 --> 00:40:27.971
Good job. Way to go.

563
00:40:28.054 --> 00:40:29.639
Try for the other side of the field.
Way to go.

564
00:40:29.723 --> 00:40:30.807
We'll work on it. Don't worry about it.

565
00:40:30.891 --> 00:40:32.392
Hey. Ray. you want to take some?

566
00:40:32.517 --> 00:40:33.518
Um...

567
00:40:33.602 --> 00:40:35.020
I mean. if you're up for it.

568
00:40:35.937 --> 00:40:37.480
Um...

569
00:40:37.564 --> 00:40:39.316
Yeah?
Sure. right?

570
00:40:39.399 --> 00:40:41.109
Take a couple. I'll be fine.

571
00:40:41.192 --> 00:40:43.778
All right. All right.
get ready. boys! Get ready!

572
00:40:43.862 --> 00:40:45.071
All right.

573
00:40:45.196 --> 00:40:46.448
Okay. you ready?

574
00:40:46.573 --> 00:40:47.949
You guys ready out there?

575
00:40:48.074 --> 00:40:49.200
Bend your knees. Bend your knees.

576
00:40:49.492 --> 00:40:50.785
Take it easy on me.

577
00:40:51.286 --> 00:40:53.163
I haven't swung in a while.

578
00:40:58.376 --> 00:41:00.420
All right. hold on.
Let me loosen up real quick.

579
00:41:00.503 --> 00:41:03.006
- Okay. okay. Next one.
Just let me... Yeah.

580
00:41:11.723 --> 00:41:13.183
Dad?

581
00:41:14.226 --> 00:41:15.268
You okay. boss?

582
00:41:15.936 --> 00:41:16.937
Ooh.

583
00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:19.481
Ray? You okay?

584
00:41:19.564 --> 00:41:22.150
I'm okay.

585
00:41:24.236 --> 00:41:25.654
I'm good. Let's keep going.

586
00:41:25.779 --> 00:41:27.239
- Okay.
I'm good. I'm good.

587
00:41:27.322 --> 00:41:28.740
Shit.

588
00:41:28.823 --> 00:41:30.283
Why don't you throw that again?

589
00:41:30.367 --> 00:41:31.409
All right.

590
00:42:13.785 --> 00:42:15.495
Oh. my God!

591
00:42:16.454 --> 00:42:17.831
Oh. my God!

592
00:42:30.051 --> 00:42:31.928
See. boys. that's how you hit a ball.

593
00:42:32.012 --> 00:42:33.638
That's how you hit it. man.

594
00:42:48.945 --> 00:42:51.615
You know the deal.
Stay in the house. bed by 10:00.

595
00:42:51.698 --> 00:42:53.158
- We'll be back after dinner.
- Mm-hmm.

596
00:42:53.241 --> 00:42:55.035
Don't make me regret not getting a sitter.

597
00:42:55.118 --> 00:42:56.745
Yeah. okay. I know.
- Yeah?

598
00:42:57.913 --> 00:42:59.289
Ray. you ready?

599
00:42:59.372 --> 00:43:00.457
We gotta go.

600
00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:12.802
Hey. someone's coming over in a minute.
It's not a big deal.

601
00:43:13.428 --> 00:43:14.512
Okay.

602
00:43:16.973 --> 00:43:18.391
It's for the swim team.

603
00:43:19.935 --> 00:43:21.019
Okay.

604
00:43:32.072 --> 00:43:33.448
If you tell Mom.

605
00:43:33.573 --> 00:43:36.034
I'm gonna put a Tide POD
in your fish tank.

606
00:43:37.661 --> 00:43:38.870
Okay.

607
00:43:40.914 --> 00:43:41.998
Marco.

608
00:43:42.958 --> 00:43:44.084
Polo.

609
00:43:44.167 --> 00:43:45.502
Marco.

610
00:43:45.585 --> 00:43:47.128
Polo.

611
00:43:51.299 --> 00:43:53.385
Marco. Marco.

612
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:54.761
Polo.

613
00:43:58.014 --> 00:43:59.766
You're cheating. You opened your eyes.

614
00:43:59.891 --> 00:44:00.892
- Uh-uh.
- Uh-huh.

615
00:44:00.976 --> 00:44:02.310
I mean. you look great with your hair wet.

616
00:44:03.853 --> 00:44:05.355
You're supposed to say "Polo."

617
00:44:05.438 --> 00:44:07.148
-  Polo.
-  Stop.

618
00:44:08.942 --> 00:44:11.027
Okay. Marco.

619
00:44:11.695 --> 00:44:13.071
Polo.

620
00:44:15.115 --> 00:44:16.116
Fish out of water.

621
00:44:16.199 --> 00:44:17.993
Nope.

622
00:44:18.952 --> 00:44:21.037
<i>They want to see you break...</i>

623
00:44:21.162 --> 00:44:22.831
Marco.

624
00:44:24.207 --> 00:44:26.793
Come on. You have to say something back.

625
00:44:27.294 --> 00:44:28.503
Polo.

626
00:44:31.298 --> 00:44:32.966
Marco.

627
00:44:33.091 --> 00:44:36.219
<i>They want to see you break...</i>

628
00:44:44.394 --> 00:44:45.770
Polo.

629
00:44:46.479 --> 00:44:47.772
Marco?

630
00:44:54.529 --> 00:44:57.365
Ronin. stop. please. Marco.

631
00:45:02.287 --> 00:45:03.496
Polo.

632
00:45:04.831 --> 00:45:06.249
I hear you.

633
00:45:14.841 --> 00:45:16.468
You're right there.

634
00:45:20.055 --> 00:45:21.306
Marco. Come on.

635
00:45:24.893 --> 00:45:26.102
Come on.

636
00:45:28.688 --> 00:45:30.232
Got you. No!

637
00:45:53.088 --> 00:45:54.214
Polo.

638
00:45:58.134 --> 00:45:59.678
Ronin. you're dead.

639
00:46:58.361 --> 00:47:00.238
I got you.

640
00:47:00.322 --> 00:47:02.574
Wait. why didn't you call
"fish out of water"?

641
00:47:02.657 --> 00:47:04.117
- Izzy?
- Oh. my God.

642
00:47:05.327 --> 00:47:06.828
- Hey.

643
00:47:06.912 --> 00:47:07.996
Izzy?

644
00:47:08.914 --> 00:47:09.915
Izzy. you okay?

645
00:47:10.665 --> 00:47:12.834
Hey. hey. hey. Talk to me.

646
00:47:12.918 --> 00:47:14.669
Something was down there.
Something grabbed me.

647
00:47:14.794 --> 00:47:16.463
- Something grabbed you?
- Were you not down there?

648
00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:19.257
No. Look. look. it's okay.
Look. I'm right here.

649
00:47:19.633 --> 00:47:20.842
I didn't see anything.

650
00:47:20.926 --> 00:47:22.344
You were only down there
for a couple seconds.

651
00:47:22.427 --> 00:47:24.304
Maybe your foot got stuck
in the pool cleaner.

652
00:47:28.183 --> 00:47:31.019
- Did it?
- I... I don't know. Maybe.

653
00:47:32.646 --> 00:47:34.231
It's okay. all right? It's okay.

654
00:47:34.898 --> 00:47:36.066
There's nothing there.

655
00:47:36.149 --> 00:47:37.150
Izzy!

656
00:47:37.234 --> 00:47:38.735
- Mom and Dad are home!
Shit. Oh. shit.

657
00:47:38.818 --> 00:47:40.195
I didn't tell my parents
you were coming over.

658
00:47:40.278 --> 00:47:41.821
- Oh. wow.
- I'm sorry. You gotta grab your stuff

659
00:47:41.905 --> 00:47:43.448
- and get out the back gate.
- All right.

660
00:47:43.531 --> 00:47:45.158
Well. thanks for inviting me over.

661
00:47:47.369 --> 00:47:49.204
All right. great.
I'll catch you on Saturday?

662
00:47:49.287 --> 00:47:51.331
Uh. Saturday?

663
00:47:51.915 --> 00:47:52.958
The pool party.

664
00:47:53.041 --> 00:47:55.210
- Oh. Yeah.
- All right.

665
00:47:59.297 --> 00:48:02.342
<i>They want to see you break...</i>

666
00:48:07.389 --> 00:48:09.057
The gate won't open.

667
00:48:16.022 --> 00:48:17.190
Izzy.

668
00:48:17.983 --> 00:48:19.943
I know something scared you last night.

669
00:48:20.777 --> 00:48:22.988
I saw the way you got out of the water.

670
00:48:23.071 --> 00:48:24.364
Go away.

671
00:48:27.367 --> 00:48:28.618
Tell me.

672
00:48:30.203 --> 00:48:32.289
Or I'm gonna tell Mom and Dad
your boyfriend was here.

673
00:48:39.045 --> 00:48:40.630
You saw something. didn't you?

674
00:48:43.633 --> 00:48:44.759
No.

675
00:48:44.843 --> 00:48:46.636
My leg just got caught
in the pool cleaner.

676
00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:49.055
- You're lying. I can tell.

677
00:48:49.139 --> 00:48:50.307
Stop.

678
00:48:54.895 --> 00:48:57.230
Things have been better
since we moved here.

679
00:48:58.690 --> 00:49:01.610
I mean. Dad's healthier.

680
00:49:01.735 --> 00:49:02.861
Mom's happy.

681
00:49:03.445 --> 00:49:06.531
Do you want to freak them out
just so we have to move again?

682
00:49:06.656 --> 00:49:08.033
What makes more sense.

683
00:49:08.116 --> 00:49:10.785
that the pool's helping us
or that it's haunted?

684
00:49:11.953 --> 00:49:13.622
What if it's both?

685
00:49:14.956 --> 00:49:15.957
Hey. I'm back!

686
00:49:19.294 --> 00:49:21.296
Keep your mouth shut.

687
00:49:21.379 --> 00:49:23.089
Hey. Where are you two?

688
00:49:23.215 --> 00:49:24.841
No one's gonna believe us anyway.

689
00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:27.719
Coming. Mom. I can help.

690
00:49:29.512 --> 00:49:31.097
Everything okay?

691
00:49:32.933 --> 00:49:34.893
Yeah. Mom. Everything's fine.

692
00:49:38.104 --> 00:49:39.356
Oh. shit.

693
00:49:39.439 --> 00:49:41.399
<i>Are you ready now</i>

694
00:49:41.483 --> 00:49:42.943
<i>To get on down?</i>

695
00:49:46.071 --> 00:49:48.198
<i>Get on down. baby</i>

696
00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:51.785
<i>Get on down...</i>

697
00:49:55.413 --> 00:49:57.207
It's so nice to meet you guys.

698
00:49:57.791 --> 00:49:59.417
I mean. you really didn't
have to bring that.

699
00:49:59.501 --> 00:50:02.212
Are you kidding?
You're hosting the entire neighborhood.

700
00:50:02.337 --> 00:50:03.672
- Thank you.
- Of course.

701
00:50:03.797 --> 00:50:05.674
Uh. is Mr. Waller here?

702
00:50:05.757 --> 00:50:07.217
Oh. yeah. He's out back.

703
00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:08.885
You-you guys can go say hi.

704
00:50:09.636 --> 00:50:12.681
Hey. Oh. my God. the house looks great.

705
00:50:12.806 --> 00:50:13.807
Oh. wow.

706
00:50:13.932 --> 00:50:15.934
I made my jiggly rum cake.

707
00:50:16.351 --> 00:50:17.352
Wow.

708
00:50:17.435 --> 00:50:19.271
But this is not for the kids. Okay?

709
00:50:19.396 --> 00:50:20.772
There's enough Captain Morgan in here

710
00:50:20.897 --> 00:50:23.400
to get Phil
into his famous Bermuda G-string.

711
00:50:23.483 --> 00:50:24.818
Grrr.

712
00:50:33.076 --> 00:50:34.786
You seem to be
doing a lot better. man.

713
00:50:34.869 --> 00:50:36.079
Thank you.
- I don't think I've ever seen

714
00:50:36.162 --> 00:50:37.247
anybody hit a ball that hard.

715
00:50:37.330 --> 00:50:39.624
Tell my agent that when you see him.

716
00:50:39.708 --> 00:50:42.335
Yeah. he used to rep
Evan Longoria. Mark Teixeira.

717
00:50:42.419 --> 00:50:44.087
- He repped a lot of good people.
- No shit.

718
00:50:44.170 --> 00:50:46.214
- Yeah.
- You know. I'd love for Ty to meet him.

719
00:50:46.298 --> 00:50:47.507
Yeah. sure. Maybe I can get him

720
00:50:47.591 --> 00:50:48.758
- to come to practice.
Sun's out. guns out.

721
00:50:48.842 --> 00:50:51.344
You ready? Let's go. Coming in.

722
00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:03.148
Yeah. so he...
He came over for a swim last night.

723
00:51:03.231 --> 00:51:05.317
Um. it was cool.

724
00:51:06.902 --> 00:51:09.863
But. uh. he... He kissed me.

725
00:51:10.739 --> 00:51:12.490
Shut up. No. he didn't.

726
00:51:12.574 --> 00:51:15.160
But I... I actually think
it's hotter that he's Christian.

727
00:51:15.702 --> 00:51:16.703
- Really?
- Really?

728
00:51:16.786 --> 00:51:17.829
Yeah. Yeah. yeah. It's. like. forbidden.

729
00:51:17.913 --> 00:51:19.915
Hey. Izzy. I got this for you.

730
00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:21.458
- You all right?
Yeah.

731
00:51:22.125 --> 00:51:23.835
- What?

732
00:51:24.753 --> 00:51:25.754
Nothing. We were just...

733
00:51:25.837 --> 00:51:27.255
- We were saying we should go for a swim.
- We're gonna go for a swim.

734
00:51:27.339 --> 00:51:28.840
- Yeah.
- We're gonna head out to the water.

735
00:51:28.965 --> 00:51:30.508
Come on. Come on.

736
00:51:30.592 --> 00:51:31.801
I'm good. thanks.

737
00:51:31.885 --> 00:51:33.511
You sure? All right.
- Yeah.

738
00:51:35.055 --> 00:51:38.058
<i>In this land of mirrors and weed</i>

739
00:51:38.183 --> 00:51:39.351
<i>Walk the line...</i>

740
00:51:48.193 --> 00:51:50.153
The kids must love the pool.

741
00:51:50.237 --> 00:51:51.655
Do you swim?

742
00:51:51.738 --> 00:51:53.531
Oh. my dad was Navy.

743
00:51:53.615 --> 00:51:55.742
I was doing dive drills
before I could walk.

744
00:51:55.825 --> 00:51:57.953
Oh. Well. you should have
seen her eyes light up

745
00:51:58.036 --> 00:51:59.537
when she saw this place.

746
00:52:01.039 --> 00:52:03.208
I can tell that you're used to hosting.

747
00:52:03.333 --> 00:52:04.459
Mm-hmm.

748
00:52:04.543 --> 00:52:06.836
Well. we moved so much
when Ray was playing.

749
00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:10.632
It's just nice to meet people
you might actually know next year.

750
00:52:10.715 --> 00:52:12.300
You're gonna know us.

751
00:52:12.384 --> 00:52:14.594
This is an annual event. like it or not.

752
00:52:22.519 --> 00:52:24.145
And did you bring your suit today?

753
00:52:24.229 --> 00:52:26.189
I did. I'm wearing it already.
- Okay. good.

754
00:52:26.273 --> 00:52:28.275
I haven't had a suit in 25 years.

755
00:52:32.529 --> 00:52:34.281
<i>Throw a little color on it...</i>

756
00:52:37.033 --> 00:52:40.412
<i>- On the canvas. bottoms up
- Bottoms up...</i>

757
00:52:43.290 --> 00:52:44.457
Hey. El!

758
00:52:45.166 --> 00:52:46.251
El!

759
00:52:46.793 --> 00:52:48.503
Where are you? Let's get in the pool.

760
00:52:48.587 --> 00:52:50.380
Mr. Waller?
- Hey.

761
00:52:50.505 --> 00:52:51.756
Hey. El!

762
00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:53.091
Will you sign this for me?

763
00:52:54.342 --> 00:52:56.553
It took me like an hour
to find it last night.

764
00:53:06.813 --> 00:53:07.939
Yeah. of course.

765
00:53:10.191 --> 00:53:12.193
Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

766
00:53:14.613 --> 00:53:15.614
There you go.

767
00:53:15.697 --> 00:53:17.657
- Now hold on to that.
- I will.

768
00:53:17.741 --> 00:53:19.075
It's gonna be worth something someday.

769
00:53:19.159 --> 00:53:20.619
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

770
00:53:21.286 --> 00:53:23.413
- Hey.
- Yeah?

771
00:53:24.539 --> 00:53:27.792
Steroid Shrek over here
thinks he owns the damn pool.

772
00:53:28.293 --> 00:53:29.544
Think we can take him?

773
00:53:33.465 --> 00:53:35.133
Yeah. I got you. man!

774
00:53:37.427 --> 00:53:39.012
- All right. we got this. okay?
- Yeah. All right.

775
00:53:39.095 --> 00:53:40.430
- Let's go. Come on.
- Okay.

776
00:53:48.104 --> 00:53:49.606
You ready. Big League?

777
00:53:54.402 --> 00:53:55.695
Nice. buddy.

778
00:53:56.363 --> 00:53:57.572
Get 'em. Mikey!

779
00:53:57.656 --> 00:53:59.282
You know. when we were fixing up the pool.

780
00:53:59.366 --> 00:54:02.702
they said it hadn't been used
in probably 15 years.

781
00:54:02.786 --> 00:54:03.787
Maybe longer.

782
00:54:04.246 --> 00:54:05.664
It's weird. right?

783
00:54:07.165 --> 00:54:08.250
No. No. I don't know.

784
00:54:08.333 --> 00:54:10.085
Maybe they weren't pool people.

785
00:54:13.838 --> 00:54:15.465
- Kay?
- Hmm?

786
00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:19.469
Okay. you know what?

787
00:54:22.931 --> 00:54:24.516
You know. this is your new home.

788
00:54:24.599 --> 00:54:27.561
and I-I didn't want to say anything
that would taint your...

789
00:54:27.644 --> 00:54:28.979
Your feelings about this house.

790
00:54:29.062 --> 00:54:31.231
Come on. we closed months ago. What is it?

791
00:54:31.731 --> 00:54:33.400
Get it. buddy. Yeah.
Ty. use your core.

792
00:54:33.483 --> 00:54:34.818
Let's go!
Use your core. Ty.

793
00:54:34.901 --> 00:54:36.111
There you go. Lean forward a little bit.

794
00:54:36.194 --> 00:54:37.445
- Yeah. That's it.
- Lean forward.

795
00:54:37.529 --> 00:54:39.573
Use your arms. Your arms.
Going down. Mikey.

796
00:54:39.656 --> 00:54:43.785
I swear. I had no idea
that this was the same house

797
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:45.996
until my friend told me
after you'd already moved in.

798
00:54:46.079 --> 00:54:50.333
And I was gonna tell you.
but you seemed so happy here. And I...

799
00:54:50.417 --> 00:54:53.712
I didn't want to put any poo
in the pudding.

800
00:54:55.797 --> 00:54:56.798
Um...

801
00:54:57.674 --> 00:54:59.301
It... It's very possible

802
00:54:59.384 --> 00:55:01.678
that the people that lived here
before. that they...

803
00:55:02.596 --> 00:55:05.348
You know. they liked the neighborhood.
and they wanted the good school district.

804
00:55:05.432 --> 00:55:08.184
but they didn't feel comfortable
using the pool

805
00:55:08.268 --> 00:55:10.770
because of certain alleged events.

806
00:55:11.271 --> 00:55:12.606
Alleged events?

807
00:55:13.273 --> 00:55:15.442
Yeah. I...

808
00:55:16.151 --> 00:55:17.569
You know. I don't remember much about it.

809
00:55:17.652 --> 00:55:20.363
Just there were these stories
about this little girl who...

810
00:55:20.447 --> 00:55:22.073
Uh. from Harold Holt...

811
00:55:23.033 --> 00:55:25.368
and she drowned here.

812
00:55:26.995 --> 00:55:29.831
I know. it's just... Oh. it is a tragedy.

813
00:55:31.041 --> 00:55:32.751
You know. I mean.
I don't know why that would make

814
00:55:32.834 --> 00:55:34.753
someone not want to use
a perfectly good swimming pool.

815
00:55:34.836 --> 00:55:35.837
but you know what?

816
00:55:35.921 --> 00:55:38.048
People are... They're superstitious.

817
00:55:38.131 --> 00:55:39.174
Aren't they. really?

818
00:55:41.009 --> 00:55:42.844
Was the little girl's name Rebecca?

819
00:55:44.804 --> 00:55:46.514
Wait. How did you know that?

820
00:55:46.598 --> 00:55:48.558
Okay. keep pushing.

821
00:55:48.642 --> 00:55:50.393
Let's go. Let's take 'em down.

822
00:55:50.477 --> 00:55:51.603
Come on. Ty.

823
00:55:51.686 --> 00:55:54.022
-  Don't give up. Use your legs.
Let's go.

824
00:55:54.105 --> 00:55:55.273
Come on. Ty.
Keep going.

825
00:55:55.357 --> 00:55:56.691
Use your legs. Ty.
You got him. Keep pushing.

826
00:55:56.775 --> 00:55:57.776
Let's go now.

827
00:55:57.859 --> 00:55:59.986
Don't give up.
Get him. Mikey.

828
00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:02.239
-  That's it. buddy.
You're going down!

829
00:56:09.329 --> 00:56:10.580
Let's go! We won!

830
00:56:12.123 --> 00:56:13.458
Let's go!

831
00:56:13.541 --> 00:56:15.835
We did it. Mr. Waller!

832
00:56:16.711 --> 00:56:18.213
All right. you can let go now.

833
00:56:18.922 --> 00:56:20.840
Mr. Waller. Mr. Waller.

834
00:56:21.633 --> 00:56:23.426
Hey. let go. Hey!

835
00:56:24.094 --> 00:56:26.054
Mr. Waller. please let go.

836
00:56:26.721 --> 00:56:28.807
You've got my legs. Mr. Waller.

837
00:56:28.890 --> 00:56:31.977
Let go! Let go!

838
00:56:40.110 --> 00:56:41.403
Mr. Waller.

839
00:56:41.528 --> 00:56:43.405
You're grabbing on my legs. Stop.

840
00:56:43.488 --> 00:56:45.365
Let go! Mr. Waller!

841
00:56:51.621 --> 00:56:52.747
Mr. Waller...

842
00:56:55.542 --> 00:56:56.668
Let go!

843
00:57:11.808 --> 00:57:12.809
Mom!

844
00:57:13.810 --> 00:57:15.020
Hey. Ty.

845
00:57:16.730 --> 00:57:17.731
Ty.

846
00:57:19.274 --> 00:57:22.027
- Baby. you seen Ty?
Mom! Mom!

847
00:57:23.028 --> 00:57:24.988
Mom. Outside in the pool.

848
00:57:28.325 --> 00:57:29.618
Oh. my God. Ty!

849
00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:31.202
Oh. my...

850
00:57:31.286 --> 00:57:32.913
- Ty?
- Out of the way! Out of the way!

851
00:57:37.167 --> 00:57:39.252
Ty! What happened?

852
00:57:39.336 --> 00:57:40.545
Help me! Someone help!

853
00:57:40.629 --> 00:57:41.630
Give him to me.
Get him out.

854
00:57:41.713 --> 00:57:43.381
Pull him over the edge.

855
00:57:43.465 --> 00:57:44.633
Someone call for help!

856
00:57:44.716 --> 00:57:46.092
Mom. look! It's Dad!
Move!

857
00:57:46.176 --> 00:57:47.219
- Ty. breathe. Breathe.
It's okay. It's okay.

858
00:57:47.302 --> 00:57:49.387
- I got him.
- Come on. breathe. breathe. What happened?

859
00:57:49.471 --> 00:57:51.056
What happened?

860
00:57:51.890 --> 00:57:53.099
What the hell happened?

861
00:57:53.183 --> 00:57:54.726
Someone call for help.

862
00:57:54.809 --> 00:57:55.977
Call 911!

863
00:57:56.061 --> 00:57:57.938
- Someone call for help.
Ray. Ray.

864
00:57:58.063 --> 00:57:59.773
What happened. Ty?

865
00:58:08.448 --> 00:58:11.117
Dad? Dad?

866
00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:12.953
- You're okay.
Okay.

867
00:58:13.036 --> 00:58:15.538
- Yeah. just hold on to my arm.
- It's okay. It's okay.

868
00:58:15.622 --> 00:58:16.623
- Okay.
Let's get him inside.

869
00:58:16.706 --> 00:58:18.959
Okay. one. two...
- It's okay. You're okay.

870
00:58:29.594 --> 00:58:31.096
Ty said he wouldn't let go.

871
00:58:31.179 --> 00:58:33.807
No. Coach. you know the disease
attacks his nervous system.

872
00:58:33.890 --> 00:58:36.059
I mean... No. He nearly drowned. too.

873
00:58:36.768 --> 00:58:38.436
We're not gonna press charges. Officer.

874
00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:39.771
We're fine.

875
00:58:40.438 --> 00:58:41.690
Hey. Eve. I just...

876
00:58:41.773 --> 00:58:44.609
I don't think
Ray should come to practice anymore.

877
00:58:47.487 --> 00:58:48.697
Look. I'm so sorry.

878
00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:50.490
Do you hear what he's saying?

879
00:58:51.157 --> 00:58:53.368
Don't come near our family again.

880
00:59:12.846 --> 00:59:14.347
<i>Come on. let's go. Let's go.</i>
<i>Wait. Wait.</i>

881
00:59:14.431 --> 00:59:15.932
- Stop. stop. Stop.
- Here. just put the...

882
00:59:16.016 --> 00:59:17.183
- Stop! God. wait.
- Get in the car.

883
00:59:17.267 --> 00:59:18.810
Wait. Where are we going?

884
00:59:18.894 --> 00:59:20.896
I don't know. Just not here.

885
00:59:22.063 --> 00:59:23.648
There's something wrong with that pool.

886
00:59:23.732 --> 00:59:25.525
Eve. there's nothing wrong with the pool.

887
00:59:25.609 --> 00:59:27.193
The pool's fine.

888
00:59:27.819 --> 00:59:30.405
The pool's the greatest thing
to ever happen to me.

889
00:59:30.488 --> 00:59:33.241
Look... Listen. I mean. honey.
it would be different this time.

890
00:59:33.325 --> 00:59:34.951
It would be so different.
We wouldn't have to make the same sacri...

891
00:59:35.035 --> 00:59:36.703
What are you talking about?

892
00:59:37.412 --> 00:59:39.581
You almost drowned today.

893
00:59:42.334 --> 00:59:44.294
That little boy almost drowned.

894
00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:54.804
All right.

895
01:00:01.102 --> 01:00:02.312
- Dad?

896
01:00:02.812 --> 01:00:04.606
- Dad. stop.
Mom. what's going on?

897
01:00:04.689 --> 01:00:06.233
- Stop the car.

898
01:00:07.234 --> 01:00:09.319
- Mom. do something.
- I don't know what to do.

899
01:00:09.402 --> 01:00:11.154
Is he breathing?

900
01:00:11.238 --> 01:00:13.990
- What is happening?
Please! He can't breathe!

901
01:00:15.242 --> 01:00:16.910
Cough it out.
- Oh. my God.

902
01:00:17.452 --> 01:00:19.037
Dad.
Get him out of the car!

903
01:00:19.829 --> 01:00:21.915
No. no. no. he's stable now. but I...

904
01:00:21.998 --> 01:00:24.084
I've never seen him like this before.

905
01:00:25.669 --> 01:00:28.797
It was like something
was attacking him from the inside.

906
01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:31.132
<i>Look.
I know these episodes are frightening.</i>

907
01:00:31.216 --> 01:00:33.260
<i>I can have him come in on Tuesday</i>

908
01:00:33.343 --> 01:00:35.971
<i>for another round of tests.
but in the meantime.</i>

909
01:00:36.596 --> 01:00:39.015
<i>- just let him rest and recover.</i>

910
01:00:43.603 --> 01:00:44.604
Eve.

911
01:00:44.688 --> 01:00:46.398
I'm sorry. I don't know what's happening.

912
01:00:46.523 --> 01:00:48.441
- It's okay.
- I didn't mean to hurt that boy.

913
01:00:48.525 --> 01:00:49.734
You don't have to talk.

914
01:00:54.489 --> 01:00:56.116
We'll just get you stable and just...

915
01:00:56.241 --> 01:00:57.867
We'll figure out what to do.

916
01:01:01.079 --> 01:01:03.123
It's just one more time.
It's just one more.

917
01:01:03.248 --> 01:01:04.833
I just need one more time.

918
01:01:04.916 --> 01:01:07.544
You can carry me into the pool.
I just need to get in one more time.

919
01:01:18.930 --> 01:01:20.765
It's so cool in the deep water.

920
01:01:24.185 --> 01:01:26.605
It's so cool in the deep.

921
01:01:59.930 --> 01:02:02.015
I told him he could sleep here tonight.

922
01:02:19.866 --> 01:02:22.494
You know your dad talks about being at bat

923
01:02:23.745 --> 01:02:27.165
and feeling this rush of strength
when you were born?

924
01:02:29.876 --> 01:02:34.756
I was 22 in a hospital
surrounded by strangers. and...

925
01:02:36.258 --> 01:02:39.052
And I felt totally alone.

926
01:02:42.013 --> 01:02:43.306
And I didn't...

927
01:02:43.390 --> 01:02:45.058
And I didn't think I could keep pushing.

928
01:02:45.183 --> 01:02:47.727
I didn't think I would... I didn't...

929
01:02:48.603 --> 01:02:50.814
I didn't think I would be a good mom.

930
01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.276
And I just wanted to give up.

931
01:02:57.195 --> 01:03:00.865
And you must have felt how scared I was.

932
01:03:01.741 --> 01:03:06.746
Because suddenly. there you were.

933
01:03:08.623 --> 01:03:10.625
And I wasn't alone anymore.

934
01:03:19.384 --> 01:03:22.053
We're never alone if we have each other.

935
01:03:24.431 --> 01:03:27.267
I'm not gonna let anything
bad happen to us. okay?

936
01:03:28.643 --> 01:03:29.728
Okay.

937
01:03:37.235 --> 01:03:38.904
<i>Hi. Eve.
I'm sorry your party ended</i>

938
01:03:38.987 --> 01:03:42.324
<i>on a sour note. but you give people time
and they're gonna forget all about it.</i>

939
01:03:42.407 --> 01:03:44.409
<i>Kay. it's not that. It's...</i>

940
01:03:45.201 --> 01:03:47.621
<i>Would you consider yourself
an open-minded person?</i>

941
01:03:47.704 --> 01:03:49.748
<i>Yeah. I like to think so.</i>

942
01:03:49.831 --> 01:03:51.082
<i>Why are you asking?</i>

943
01:03:51.166 --> 01:03:52.667
It wasn't just Rebecca.

944
01:03:52.751 --> 01:03:54.502
If you go back. there's more people

945
01:03:54.586 --> 01:03:56.546
<i>who lived at the house
who just went missing.</i>

946
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:58.298
<i>I need to know what's going on.</i>

947
01:03:58.381 --> 01:04:01.426
<i>Eve. I swear I told you
everything I knew at the house.</i>

948
01:04:01.509 --> 01:04:03.637
<i>I don't know anything about this.</i>

949
01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:06.598
<i>- Just tell me what I can do to help.
- Does the Summers family live nearby?</i>

950
01:04:52.143 --> 01:04:53.186
Hi.

951
01:04:54.271 --> 01:04:56.106
My name is Eve Waller.

952
01:04:57.232 --> 01:04:59.067
I tried to call you yesterday.

953
01:04:59.150 --> 01:05:01.861
I think my family lives in your old house.

954
01:05:01.945 --> 01:05:03.530
With the pool?

955
01:05:04.406 --> 01:05:06.825
Oh. Yes.

956
01:05:07.450 --> 01:05:08.451
Come in.

957
01:05:09.869 --> 01:05:11.079
That's Thomas.

958
01:05:12.163 --> 01:05:14.916
USAID ambassador in Washington.

959
01:05:15.709 --> 01:05:20.881
His work in Sudan saved thousands
during the refugee crisis.

960
01:05:21.631 --> 01:05:22.632
Your son?

961
01:05:22.757 --> 01:05:25.302
Yeah. My pride and joy.

962
01:05:26.761 --> 01:05:29.848
He's responsible for this beautiful home.

963
01:05:29.931 --> 01:05:32.100
Though he doesn't visit
as much as I'd like.

964
01:05:32.934 --> 01:05:36.771
This is about as far
as I can make it. if you don't mind.

965
01:05:36.855 --> 01:05:37.856
Please.

966
01:05:42.235 --> 01:05:45.655
I know this is strange.
but I wanted to ask you about

967
01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:47.324
when you lived at the house.

968
01:05:47.449 --> 01:05:51.077
Oh.  What a special place.

969
01:05:52.746 --> 01:05:54.581
Tommy loved that pool.

970
01:05:54.664 --> 01:05:56.875
I could hardly get him out of the water.

971
01:05:59.044 --> 01:06:01.296
Did you have a daughter. too?

972
01:06:04.716 --> 01:06:07.385
No. it's... It's just Thomas and I.

973
01:06:08.386 --> 01:06:11.223
Oh. he writes the most wonderful letters.

974
01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:13.433
He's in Washington.

975
01:06:13.516 --> 01:06:15.227
doing so much good.

976
01:06:19.356 --> 01:06:21.441
Mrs. Summers. I'm not here to upset you.

977
01:06:22.776 --> 01:06:24.945
But I don't know who else to talk to.

978
01:06:26.947 --> 01:06:28.573
My husband was sick.

979
01:06:29.908 --> 01:06:33.078
and we moved into the house.

980
01:06:33.161 --> 01:06:34.788
and he started getting better.

981
01:06:36.748 --> 01:06:38.166
And I think

982
01:06:39.626 --> 01:06:41.545
the pool made him better.

983
01:06:44.172 --> 01:06:47.384
But my kids have seen things.

984
01:06:50.011 --> 01:06:51.429
And so have I.

985
01:06:55.225 --> 01:06:58.770
There's something bad
in the water. isn't there?

986
01:07:09.406 --> 01:07:11.241
What happened to your daughter?

987
01:07:12.784 --> 01:07:13.785
To Rebecca?

988
01:07:18.039 --> 01:07:21.418
Please. I'm worried that the same thing
is going to happen to my husband.

989
01:07:43.189 --> 01:07:46.526
Did you ever use
a wishing well as a child?

990
01:07:48.486 --> 01:07:50.572
Throw a coin in the water

991
01:07:52.157 --> 01:07:54.326
and pray with all your heart.

992
01:07:57.746 --> 01:08:00.498
Some water is magic.

993
01:08:11.509 --> 01:08:14.179
Before there was a house

994
01:08:15.347 --> 01:08:16.765
or a pool.

995
01:08:18.225 --> 01:08:20.435
<i>there was a spring in the ground.</i>

996
01:08:21.561 --> 01:08:23.437
<i>I don't know what's beneath the surface.</i>

997
01:08:23.521 --> 01:08:24.940
<i>Maybe no one does.</i>

998
01:08:26.274 --> 01:08:30.195
<i>But I know it gives us
our deepest desires.</i>

999
01:08:31.196 --> 01:08:35.115
<i>The people then must have worshipped it</i>

1000
01:08:36.117 --> 01:08:38.745
when they found out what it could do.

1001
01:08:41.373 --> 01:08:42.791
<i>Temagami.</i>

1002
01:08:44.376 --> 01:08:46.086
The deep water.

1003
01:08:47.879 --> 01:08:50.966
<i>Temagami. Temagami.</i>

1004
01:08:51.048 --> 01:08:53.927
The well has a wish of its own.

1005
01:08:54.010 --> 01:08:57.430
<i>Once the water is woken.
it will take a life.</i>

1006
01:08:58.265 --> 01:09:02.269
<i>Someone has to pay
so the water can keep giving.</i>

1007
01:09:02.352 --> 01:09:04.145
<i>The way it gave to me.</i>

1008
01:09:06.356 --> 01:09:08.275
Tommy was so sick.

1009
01:09:13.071 --> 01:09:14.573
And look at him now.

1010
01:09:19.452 --> 01:09:21.538
But what happened to your daughter?

1011
01:09:22.038 --> 01:09:23.039
It was...

1012
01:09:24.039 --> 01:09:26.251
better with Rebecca.

1013
01:09:27.002 --> 01:09:29.337
more humane for a child

1014
01:09:29.421 --> 01:09:31.131
not to know

1015
01:09:32.507 --> 01:09:33.842
what was coming.

1016
01:09:35.468 --> 01:09:37.178
Mom! Help!

1017
01:09:37.262 --> 01:09:39.306
Mom! Mom!

1018
01:09:43.727 --> 01:09:44.811
Mom!

1019
01:09:44.895 --> 01:09:47.062
Becky? Becky!

1020
01:09:47.146 --> 01:09:49.441
Mom! Mom!

1021
01:09:49.524 --> 01:09:51.443
- Help!

1022
01:09:51.526 --> 01:09:53.069
Mom. Becky's outside!

1023
01:09:53.153 --> 01:09:55.530
Mom! Mom!

1024
01:09:56.615 --> 01:09:58.158
Mom!

1025
01:09:58.241 --> 01:10:00.619
Mom. Becky's outside!

1026
01:10:01.161 --> 01:10:04.456
<i>The water used me as a vessel</i>

1027
01:10:04.539 --> 01:10:07.125
<i>to do what must be done.</i>

1028
01:10:08.710 --> 01:10:11.046
<i>Don't worry about your husband.</i>

1029
01:10:12.130 --> 01:10:14.549
He's the one who gets the wish.

1030
01:10:15.258 --> 01:10:16.551
He gets his health.

1031
01:10:16.635 --> 01:10:18.303
I got my son back.

1032
01:10:18.386 --> 01:10:19.804
It'll be worth it.

1033
01:10:20.472 --> 01:10:21.473
You'll see.

1034
01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:25.352
Love requires sacrifice.

1035
01:10:25.435 --> 01:10:27.187
That's not love.

1036
01:10:29.064 --> 01:10:32.484
It's not a sacrifice
if you get something back.

1037
01:10:33.068 --> 01:10:35.487
Rebecca asked where you were.

1038
01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:39.199
She's still looking for you.

1039
01:10:39.741 --> 01:10:41.326
You can still help us.

1040
01:10:41.785 --> 01:10:44.412
There has to be some way to stop this.

1041
01:11:25.954 --> 01:11:28.707
It'll be over soon.

1042
01:11:30.625 --> 01:11:34.045
The water will sleep again.

1043
01:11:36.882 --> 01:11:38.091
And...

1044
01:11:39.050 --> 01:11:41.761
someone else will find the house.

1045
01:11:43.388 --> 01:11:47.809
Someone else who needs its help.

1046
01:12:40.946 --> 01:12:42.948
Thanks. Ronin. See you tomorrow.

1047
01:12:45.825 --> 01:12:47.827
Hey. Mom. Dad. we're home.

1048
01:12:50.664 --> 01:12:51.998
- Mom?

1049
01:12:54.042 --> 01:12:55.502
Dad. we're home.

1050
01:13:00.090 --> 01:13:01.299
She's not answering.

1051
01:13:02.217 --> 01:13:03.843
Think Dad might be with her.

1052
01:13:04.928 --> 01:13:06.471
I'm gonna go check the garage.

1053
01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:22.821
Cider?

1054
01:13:35.375 --> 01:13:36.543
Cider?

1055
01:13:41.715 --> 01:13:43.049
Come here. Cider.

1056
01:13:57.272 --> 01:13:58.565
Come here. Cider.

1057
01:14:12.078 --> 01:14:13.455
What?

1058
01:14:23.423 --> 01:14:24.507
Cider?

1059
01:14:39.606 --> 01:14:41.149
- It's okay. buddy.

1060
01:14:42.067 --> 01:14:43.151
I'm right here.

1061
01:15:19.813 --> 01:15:21.022
Cider?

1062
01:15:36.246 --> 01:15:37.581
Elliot!

1063
01:15:42.085 --> 01:15:45.088
Elliot! Elliot!

1064
01:15:58.226 --> 01:15:59.269
Mom.

1065
01:15:59.352 --> 01:16:01.229
- Come on. Okay. okay.
- Izzy. help me. Come on.

1066
01:16:11.072 --> 01:16:13.199
I don't know what happened.
I don't know... Elliot's down there.

1067
01:16:13.283 --> 01:16:14.701
- All I know is that he...
- Go in the house.

1068
01:16:14.784 --> 01:16:17.203
- Call for help. Go!
- Okay. Okay. I'm going.

1069
01:16:29.216 --> 01:16:30.467
Dad!

1070
01:17:38.201 --> 01:17:39.411
Dad?

1071
01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:58.680
- Dad!
- There you are.

1072
01:18:00.765 --> 01:18:02.434
I've been looking for you. Iz.

1073
01:18:04.269 --> 01:18:05.937
- What's the matter?

1074
01:18:18.116 --> 01:18:20.744
Okay. I'm... I'm calling for help.

1075
01:18:25.582 --> 01:18:27.083
-  Don't do that!

1076
01:18:47.979 --> 01:18:50.565
- I know you want me to get better.

1077
01:18:52.567 --> 01:18:54.152
You understand. don't you?

1078
01:18:56.238 --> 01:18:57.906
We have to get help.

1079
01:18:57.989 --> 01:18:59.991
Baby. we already got help.

1080
01:19:02.953 --> 01:19:04.913
Life is too hard for Elliot.

1081
01:19:06.206 --> 01:19:07.415
It's better this way.

1082
01:19:13.630 --> 01:19:15.632
No! No!

1083
01:19:22.514 --> 01:19:25.559
Help! Help! Help!

1084
01:19:25.642 --> 01:19:26.810
Marco.

1085
01:20:20.405 --> 01:20:21.740
Help!

1086
01:20:22.407 --> 01:20:24.409
Please! Help!

1087
01:20:24.534 --> 01:20:26.745
Is anyone out there? Call for help!

1088
01:20:35.837 --> 01:20:37.172
Marco.

1089
01:20:44.930 --> 01:20:48.683
{\an8}<i>Take me out to the ball game</i>

1090
01:20:48.808 --> 01:20:52.562
{\an8}<i>Take me out with the crowd</i>

1091
01:20:52.687 --> 01:20:56.066
<i>Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack</i>

1092
01:20:56.191 --> 01:20:57.943
<i>I don't care...</i>

1093
01:21:02.989 --> 01:21:06.201
- You're supposed to say "Polo."

1094
01:22:25.989 --> 01:22:29.409
Why don't you stay here.
and it'll all be over soon?

1095
01:22:44.966 --> 01:22:46.134
Ellie.

1096
01:22:48.136 --> 01:22:49.763
Oh. God. Come on.

1097
01:22:49.846 --> 01:22:51.097
Come on. Ellie. Come on.

1098
01:22:51.181 --> 01:22:54.226
One. two. three. four. five.

1099
01:22:54.309 --> 01:22:56.228
Come on. Come on.

1100
01:23:00.690 --> 01:23:01.691
It's too late.

1101
01:23:04.653 --> 01:23:06.363
Love requires sacrifice.

1102
01:23:06.988 --> 01:23:08.406
Ray.

1103
01:23:09.616 --> 01:23:11.034
Oh. Ray. please.

1104
01:23:11.117 --> 01:23:13.119
Please. we need to get him
to a hospital. Ray.

1105
01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:15.622
He needs your help. Look at him.

1106
01:23:23.004 --> 01:23:25.257
The water chose him.

1107
01:23:27.175 --> 01:23:28.593
He loves the pool.

1108
01:23:29.177 --> 01:23:30.971
Elliot will always be here.

1109
01:23:31.054 --> 01:23:32.681
He'll always be here.

1110
01:23:52.325 --> 01:23:53.326
<i>Dad.</i>

1111
01:23:55.453 --> 01:23:56.997
<i>Something has you.</i>

1112
01:23:58.331 --> 01:23:59.583
<i>You have to fight it.</i>

1113
01:24:01.710 --> 01:24:04.796
<i>It's going to take sacrifice.
but you can have a good life together.</i>

1114
01:24:05.297 --> 01:24:07.632
<i>I just need to know
that you want that. too.</i>

1115
01:24:07.716 --> 01:24:09.050
<i>Please come back.</i>

1116
01:24:09.134 --> 01:24:10.427
<i>I want that. too.</i>

1117
01:24:10.510 --> 01:24:11.970
<i>Elliot needs you.</i>

1118
01:24:15.348 --> 01:24:16.433
Ray?

1119
01:24:16.516 --> 01:24:17.726
Come back.

1120
01:24:18.268 --> 01:24:20.395
Come back. Come back.

1121
01:24:29.905 --> 01:24:31.448
Izzy. no. Izzy...

1122
01:24:37.746 --> 01:24:38.872
Yeah. it's me.

1123
01:24:39.414 --> 01:24:40.790
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1124
01:24:40.874 --> 01:24:42.626
Mom.

1125
01:24:43.043 --> 01:24:44.502
Ellie!
- Is he okay?

1126
01:24:44.586 --> 01:24:47.380
He's breathing.
We gotta get him out of here.

1127
01:24:49.257 --> 01:24:51.635
Come on. Come on. baby.

1128
01:24:53.178 --> 01:24:54.512
Dad. come on. Let's go.

1129
01:24:56.181 --> 01:24:58.016
<i>Temagami.</i>

1130
01:25:07.984 --> 01:25:09.736
Dad?

1131
01:25:10.487 --> 01:25:12.322
- Oh. my God. Mom?

1132
01:25:16.493 --> 01:25:17.869
Baby. what's wrong?

1133
01:25:19.704 --> 01:25:21.289
Elliot.
- Mom. it's the water.

1134
01:25:21.373 --> 01:25:22.874
It's not gonna let him leave.

1135
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:25.418
Ray. it's... It's getting worse.

1136
01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:30.173
Get him up. Izzy. Help me.

1137
01:25:31.841 --> 01:25:33.260
Someone has to pay.

1138
01:25:53.530 --> 01:25:54.656
Dad?

1139
01:25:57.576 --> 01:25:58.785
Dad. where are you going?

1140
01:25:58.910 --> 01:26:00.245
Don't look back.

1141
01:26:04.666 --> 01:26:05.667
Ray?

1142
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:07.168
Dad!

1143
01:26:08.712 --> 01:26:09.713
Dad!

1144
01:26:39.659 --> 01:26:40.660
Ellie!

1145
01:26:42.454 --> 01:26:43.622
Are you okay?

1146
01:26:43.705 --> 01:26:45.165
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

1147
01:26:46.166 --> 01:26:47.167
I'm good.

1148
01:26:47.250 --> 01:26:48.418
I'm okay.

1149
01:26:48.501 --> 01:26:49.669
Where's Dad?

1150
01:27:02.807 --> 01:27:03.934
I got you.

1151
01:27:04.059 --> 01:27:05.060
Okay.

1152
01:27:05.143 --> 01:27:06.811
Okay.

1153
01:27:33.838 --> 01:27:35.382
<i>Hey. Eve. kids.</i>

1154
01:27:37.050 --> 01:27:38.218
<i>Um...</i>

1155
01:27:38.301 --> 01:27:42.973
<i>I don't know
what's gonna come of all this.</i>

1156
01:27:43.848 --> 01:27:46.184
<i>but I just feel like
I still got something to prove.</i>

1157
01:27:47.435 --> 01:27:48.645
<i>You know. and...</i>

1158
01:27:49.479 --> 01:27:51.106
<i>I want to make you proud.</i>

1159
01:27:54.359 --> 01:27:56.278
<i>Baseball's always just come easy to me.</i>

1160
01:27:57.571 --> 01:28:01.199
<i>And... the other stuff. not so much.</i>

1161
01:28:03.785 --> 01:28:05.036
<i>So...</i>

1162
01:28:06.746 --> 01:28:08.164
<i>I guess I just...</i>

1163
01:28:09.791 --> 01:28:11.376
<i>wish I knew a better way</i>

1164
01:28:12.544 --> 01:28:14.379
<i>to let you know how much you mean to me.</i>

1165
01:28:18.842 --> 01:28:20.010
<i>Love you.</i>

1166
01:28:29.311 --> 01:28:30.645
This yours?

1167
01:28:36.026 --> 01:28:38.028
You know. we could still sell the house.

1168
01:28:39.487 --> 01:28:40.822
I mean. we could go anywhere.

1169
01:28:44.117 --> 01:28:47.537
But then it's going to happen
to someone else. isn't it?

1170
01:28:49.748 --> 01:28:51.166
Dad wouldn't want that.

1171
01:29:47.722 --> 01:29:51.434
<i>Can you speak. can you call my name?</i>

1172
01:29:51.977 --> 01:29:53.311
<i>Take my hand</i>

1173
01:29:53.395 --> 01:29:56.731
<i>Maybe we could be together somehow</i>

1174
01:29:56.815 --> 01:30:00.193
<i>Jumping in. but I'm so afraid</i>

1175
01:30:00.986 --> 01:30:05.574
<i>I feel the rush.
but I'm rising to the surface now</i>

1176
01:30:05.699 --> 01:30:09.160
<i>But you say go deeper</i>

1177
01:30:09.286 --> 01:30:11.454
<i>Go deeper</i>

1178
01:30:11.580 --> 01:30:15.250
<i>Take me deeper into your love</i>

1179
01:30:15.375 --> 01:30:18.378
<i>You say go deeper</i>

1180
01:30:18.503 --> 01:30:20.714
<i>Go deeper</i>

1181
01:30:20.839 --> 01:30:24.467
<i>Fall deeper into me</i>

1182
01:30:24.593 --> 01:30:27.971
<i>Take me deeper</i>

1183
01:30:29.264 --> 01:30:34.144
<i>Drag me down to the other side</i>

1184
01:30:34.269 --> 01:30:37.230
<i>Pull me under</i>

1185
01:30:38.481 --> 01:30:43.153
<i>Fill my lungs with your memories</i>

1186
01:30:43.278 --> 01:30:46.364
<i>How is it real?</i>

1187
01:30:46.489 --> 01:30:49.868
<i>I can hear your heart through the screams</i>

1188
01:30:49.993 --> 01:30:51.912
<i>And it's calling me</i>

1189
01:31:02.047 --> 01:31:05.383
<i>Take me deeper</i>

1190
01:31:06.635 --> 01:31:11.431
<i>Drag me down to the other side</i>

1191
01:31:11.514 --> 01:31:14.559
<i>How is it real?</i>

1192
01:31:14.684 --> 01:31:18.063
<i>I can hear your heart through the screams</i>

1193
01:31:18.188 --> 01:31:21.483
<i>And it's calling me deep</i>
