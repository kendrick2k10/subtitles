<i>This film contains scenes</i>
<i>that may cause an epileptic seizure.</i>

4
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:25.000
<i>scenes that contain smoking. alcohol</i>
<i>and drug use. meaningless sex. fights…</i>

5
00:00:25.083 --> 00:00:27.250
<i>well. you know.</i>
<i>some uncontrolled brawling.</i>

6
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:31.416
<i>attempted sexual assault. gay sex.</i>
<i>straight sex. perversions. swearing…</i>

7
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.750
<i>Point is: don't try to repeat it.</i>

8
00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:37.791
<i>If you're afraid of living</i>
<i>such a fun life like ours… like mine.</i>

9
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.708
Hey. what's wrong?

10
00:01:08.291 --> 00:01:09.708
That was a good warm up…

11
00:01:09.791 --> 00:01:12.125
What's good about it? It sounds like shit.

12
00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:15.083
Man! You told us we were nailing it.

13
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:16.416
Oh yeah…

14
00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:19.958
It is us who could be nailed
to the barndoor

15
00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:21.791
with these old instruments of ours.

16
00:01:26.458 --> 00:01:27.833
<i>Back then. I didn't realize</i>

17
00:01:27.916 --> 00:01:30.833
<i>I was completely terrified</i>
<i>before our first concert.</i>

18
00:01:30.916 --> 00:01:33.625
<i>I was ready to burn down</i>
<i>all of our rubbish instruments.</i>

19
00:01:33.708 --> 00:01:37.083
<i>I'd pretend to have a terminal illness.</i>
<i>run away to Poland in women's clothes…</i>

20
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:39.583
<i>Just to avoid shitting myself</i>
<i>in front of five people.</i>

21
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:42.875
<i>as we wouldn't get more fans</i>
<i>in the whole Lviv.</i>

22
00:01:45.625 --> 00:01:48.750
Kuzia! That's a good guitar! Chill out!

23
00:01:48.833 --> 00:01:52.291
Lesyk. if it was a good guitar you'd see
"Fender Stratocaster" written on it!

24
00:01:52.375 --> 00:01:54.291
So take a marker and write it!

25
00:01:57.125 --> 00:02:00.125
Write it on your asses!
Maybe someone will believe you're branded.

26
00:02:00.916 --> 00:02:03.458
Nobody in the hall will see
what you have written there.

27
00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:05.250
and we play just fine.

28
00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:07.458
The concert will be awesome. dude!

29
00:02:09.708 --> 00:02:10.625
Come on!

30
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.291
<i>It's been like that since we were kids.</i>
<i>Yatsyk believed in me.</i>

31
00:02:15.375 --> 00:02:18.791
<i>He even agreed to start</i>
<i>a spider farm in granny's tulips.</i>

32
00:02:18.875 --> 00:02:22.958
<i>But before our first concert</i>
<i>I was just sick of his belief.</i>

33
00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:25.166
<i>Maybe I was afraid to let him down…</i>

34
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.708
So. guys. the concert is in four days.

35
00:02:28.208 --> 00:02:30.083
We have to rehearse. Let's go.

36
00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:33.625
<i>Lesyk was suspicious of my crazy ideas.</i>

37
00:02:33.708 --> 00:02:36.791
<i>but he was always ready</i>
<i>to get me out of any mess.</i>

38
00:02:36.875 --> 00:02:38.375
<i>And it was comforting.</i>

39
00:02:57.125 --> 00:02:58.500
Stop. stop!

40
00:02:58.583 --> 00:03:00.541
Let's take a time out. guys.

41
00:03:00.625 --> 00:03:02.708
We have another 40 minutes of rehearsal.

42
00:03:03.208 --> 00:03:04.708
Hey! Kuzia!

43
00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:13.333
You can start packing.

44
00:03:46.458 --> 00:03:47.458
Hello!

45
00:03:49.083 --> 00:03:50.208
Yeah. it's me.

46
00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.041
What's up?

47
00:03:57.041 --> 00:03:58.041
Cool!

48
00:03:59.833 --> 00:04:01.000
Okay.

49
00:04:01.916 --> 00:04:03.416
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

50
00:04:05.166 --> 00:04:06.666
Okay. yeah…

51
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.375
Fine. Yeah.

52
00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:12.083
Sorry guys. I'll be right back.

53
00:04:13.291 --> 00:04:16.916
{\an8}KUZMA AND THE PENGUINS

54
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.166
Did you bring the money?

55
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.333
Sure!

56
00:04:35.666 --> 00:04:36.833
Voilà!

57
00:04:46.208 --> 00:04:47.458
A real rarity!

58
00:04:47.541 --> 00:04:49.500
That's some unique stuff!

59
00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:52.750
Are you sure you wanna sell it?

60
00:04:55.166 --> 00:04:58.041
I don't care about the material things.

61
00:04:59.458 --> 00:05:00.666
So. give me the money.

62
00:05:17.208 --> 00:05:18.291
Here you go.

63
00:05:20.833 --> 00:05:22.083
Where did you get it?

64
00:05:22.166 --> 00:05:25.458
I had some cash.
and I borrowed some from a neighbor.

65
00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:28.166
She sells "J.boyz" at the market.
Everybody knows her.

66
00:05:31.333 --> 00:05:34.916
<i>I was glad that the neighbor gave me</i>
<i>the money in 100 notes. not in 10 notes.</i>

67
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.333
<i>'Cause we'd have spent</i>
<i>the whole night in the garage.</i>

68
00:05:37.416 --> 00:05:40.750
<i>It seemed like the Painter</i>
<i>was afraid to count dollars in daylight.</i>

69
00:05:40.833 --> 00:05:43.375
<i>To avoid being arrested</i>
<i>for exchange fraud.</i>

70
00:05:44.875 --> 00:05:47.958
What are you still doing there?
What are you waiting for?

71
00:05:48.041 --> 00:05:49.458
Get behind the wheel.

72
00:05:53.458 --> 00:05:56.291
<i>I got so excited</i>
<i>I almost moved myself to tears.</i>

73
00:05:56.375 --> 00:05:59.416
<i>I felt like I was in a big</i>
<i>and spacious Stalin-era building.</i>

74
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.583
<i>You could hardly see anything</i>
<i>through the rear window.</i>

75
00:06:02.666 --> 00:06:05.625
<i>But it created such a cozy atmosphere.</i>

76
00:06:05.708 --> 00:06:08.250
<i>As if you were sheltered</i>
<i>from the outside world.</i>

77
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.583
Female pig.

78
00:06:13.541 --> 00:06:14.458
What?

79
00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:17.416
The seats are made
from female pig leather.

80
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.916
Specially ordered by some party boss.

81
00:06:25.541 --> 00:06:26.458
Come on.

82
00:06:46.583 --> 00:06:49.541
The bucks are fake?
The neighbor smuggled the fake ones.

83
00:06:49.625 --> 00:06:52.250
She brought
that Turkish garbage and sells it.

84
00:06:53.541 --> 00:06:58.000
It has never left the garage
without this thing.

85
00:06:58.083 --> 00:06:59.708
Here. take it.

86
00:06:59.791 --> 00:07:02.541
See that opening? Put this thing in it.

87
00:07:04.583 --> 00:07:06.041
This won't hurt?

88
00:07:06.666 --> 00:07:09.166
Wet it and it won't hurt.

89
00:07:11.083 --> 00:07:12.083
Come on.

90
00:07:20.625 --> 00:07:22.291
You have to rev the engine.

91
00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:27.250
Go ahead. Wind it up again.

92
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.000
Come on. come on!

93
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.916
Yes!

94
00:07:44.791 --> 00:07:46.875
There is no muffler!

95
00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:47.958
I got it!

96
00:07:56.666 --> 00:07:59.000
Do you know how to drive?

97
00:07:59.541 --> 00:08:01.791
I've been driving since I was three!

98
00:08:35.875 --> 00:08:37.041
Barbara!

99
00:08:44.708 --> 00:08:46.041
Barbara!

100
00:08:46.125 --> 00:08:47.875
KUZMA AND THE PENGUINS

101
00:08:48.666 --> 00:08:51.083
What an idiot!

102
00:08:51.666 --> 00:08:53.833
Go away with this hooptie!

103
00:08:53.916 --> 00:08:57.375
Or I'll call her father. He'll kill you!

104
00:08:58.125 --> 00:08:59.583
Good morning. aunt Marichka!

105
00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:03.875
Good morning!

106
00:09:10.708 --> 00:09:12.208
<i>It was Barbara!</i>

107
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:16.416
<i>When I saw her I was losing my mind.</i>

108
00:09:17.416 --> 00:09:19.166
<i>It's still like that.</i>

109
00:09:21.083 --> 00:09:22.333
Salut!

110
00:09:22.416 --> 00:09:24.791
Don't even think
about getting inside this bucket.

111
00:09:24.875 --> 00:09:26.208
Thank you aunt Marichka.

112
00:09:26.291 --> 00:09:29.333
but I'll decide for myself
where to get inside.

113
00:09:30.791 --> 00:09:31.958
What took you so long?

114
00:09:32.041 --> 00:09:33.375
I was getting dressed.

115
00:09:33.458 --> 00:09:34.833
You were supposed to be ready.

116
00:09:34.916 --> 00:09:38.458
I've been waiting for you for two hours.
that's enough time to change 20 times.

117
00:09:38.541 --> 00:09:40.541
I went to pick up the limo.

118
00:09:44.208 --> 00:09:45.500
Please. my lady!

119
00:09:49.416 --> 00:09:50.625
Where did you get it?

120
00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:55.458
- There is nothing that can bite me. right?
- Come on. get in.

121
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.458
The ceiling looks like a universe.

122
00:10:52.416 --> 00:10:53.583
Yeah. check it out.

123
00:11:24.583 --> 00:11:26.416
And why exactly did we come here?

124
00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:31.541
We could lie down for a while.

125
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.541
Come on. what's wrong?

126
00:11:49.666 --> 00:11:51.291
I've waited for you for half a day.

127
00:11:52.291 --> 00:11:54.416
I would rather have visited an exhibition.

128
00:12:01.375 --> 00:12:02.833
Put your hands in the air

129
00:12:04.375 --> 00:12:06.083
and the Sun will melt.

130
00:12:11.208 --> 00:12:12.750
Let your hair down

131
00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:15.958
and I'll go crazy.

132
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.750
Do you still think about the exhibition?

133
00:12:35.333 --> 00:12:36.708
Just a bit…

134
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.458
When do you have to give it back?

135
00:12:48.541 --> 00:12:49.791
What?

136
00:12:49.875 --> 00:12:51.333
The car.

137
00:12:51.416 --> 00:12:53.166
What do you mean "give it back"?

138
00:12:58.791 --> 00:13:00.000
Did you buy it?

139
00:13:00.791 --> 00:13:02.000
Well. yeah.

140
00:13:02.083 --> 00:13:03.708
You told me you wanted a car.

141
00:13:04.458 --> 00:13:05.458
Wait.

142
00:13:07.083 --> 00:13:08.916
I meant someday.

143
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:12.375
I didn't mean today.

144
00:13:13.416 --> 00:13:17.250
When you become a famous musician
we'll buy a proper car

145
00:13:17.333 --> 00:13:19.250
and we'll go to Europe together.

146
00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:22.916
It's just a dream. I didn't mean today.

147
00:13:23.458 --> 00:13:26.333
We're just getting ready
to your first concert.

148
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:32.750
Wait. When did you buy it?

149
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:35.291
Today in the morning. why?

150
00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958
Didn't you have a rehearsal this morning?

151
00:13:44.375 --> 00:13:45.916
Damn…

152
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.416
Come on. I'll buy you a hundred of those.

153
00:13:51.625 --> 00:13:54.083
You won't find the red ones in Lviv.
you know it.

154
00:13:59.083 --> 00:14:02.041
I still can't believe
you left the rehearsal.

155
00:14:03.041 --> 00:14:06.041
- Why the hell did you need this car?
- I can sell it if you want.

156
00:14:06.125 --> 00:14:08.916
I want you to understand
what is actually important for you.

157
00:14:10.041 --> 00:14:13.708
Even aunt Marichka says
that what you do is amatOurship.

158
00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.375
AmatOurship?

159
00:14:20.666 --> 00:14:23.458
Of course I don't think so.

160
00:14:23.541 --> 00:14:24.958
But you got to admit. Kuzia.

161
00:14:25.041 --> 00:14:28.791
it's difficult to defend you when
there is nothing that you'd carry through.

162
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.208
Lesyk even forgot about the exams
to have the rehearsals.

163
00:14:32.291 --> 00:14:33.416
Yatsyk. about the sea…

164
00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:37.000
And you just walked away
from everybody. from me. just to buy…

165
00:14:38.041 --> 00:14:39.333
this rubbish.

166
00:14:47.041 --> 00:14:48.500
Are you serious?

167
00:14:48.583 --> 00:14:49.750
AmatOurship?

168
00:14:55.125 --> 00:14:57.875
You have to decide
what you really wanna do in life.

169
00:15:03.625 --> 00:15:05.000
When will I see you?

170
00:15:06.083 --> 00:15:07.250
At the concert.

171
00:15:07.875 --> 00:15:10.833
When you'll understand who you are
and stop doing foolish things.

172
00:15:10.916 --> 00:15:12.000
Barbara!

173
00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:13.833
Barbara!

174
00:15:15.791 --> 00:15:17.750
I'll buy you those tights!

175
00:15:26.041 --> 00:15:27.666
Lying down for a while…

176
00:15:57.708 --> 00:15:58.708
Mechanic.

177
00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:01.791
- Hey. Bard!
- Hey.

178
00:16:04.375 --> 00:16:06.875
Cool car. Is it yours?

179
00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:07.958
Yes.

180
00:16:08.625 --> 00:16:10.083
The real deal.

181
00:16:10.166 --> 00:16:11.916
I've already changed the muffler.

182
00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:17.541
Maybe you wanna buy it?

183
00:16:18.375 --> 00:16:20.000
No. no. no…

184
00:16:20.083 --> 00:16:23.666
Don't fool me with this antique stuff.

185
00:16:26.833 --> 00:16:28.291
Where did you find it?

186
00:16:29.291 --> 00:16:30.541
Don't even ask.

187
00:16:37.458 --> 00:16:39.041
I wanted to impress Barbara.

188
00:16:41.833 --> 00:16:43.583
I've been to Berlin recently.

189
00:16:45.833 --> 00:16:47.833
There is this guy there.

190
00:16:48.333 --> 00:16:49.916
he collects old buckets.

191
00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:52.083
You know…

192
00:16:52.583 --> 00:16:57.458
He'll give you a new Mercedes
for a real Soviet-era "Pobeda".

193
00:16:57.541 --> 00:17:00.041
Yeah. right. Mercedes Benz S 600. maybe?

194
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.166
A Mercedes.

195
00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:11.166
Do you have his contacts?

196
00:17:18.333 --> 00:17:21.166
I have to go to Berlin one more time.
to deliver some goods.

197
00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.125
We could take your car.

198
00:17:27.916 --> 00:17:30.791
I could introduce you to the guy.
you'll get everything settled.

199
00:17:31.666 --> 00:17:33.291
- What do you say?
- Berlin?

200
00:17:34.666 --> 00:17:36.250
Do you really need to ask?

201
00:17:36.333 --> 00:17:37.541
Of course. let's go!

202
00:17:38.791 --> 00:17:42.916
{\an8}BASED ON THE STORY BY KUZMA SCRYABIN
ROCKY ROAD TO BERLIN

203
00:17:44.583 --> 00:17:46.333
Why do Germans need these mannequins?

204
00:17:46.416 --> 00:17:47.375
I don't know.

205
00:17:47.458 --> 00:17:49.250
I buy them for 3 rubles apiece

206
00:17:49.333 --> 00:17:54.541
and I sell them for 150 D-Marks
for this old junk. Can you believe it?

207
00:17:55.916 --> 00:17:57.916
150 D-Marks?!

208
00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.500
That's real money!

209
00:18:01.625 --> 00:18:04.125
Where did you find these orphans?

210
00:18:04.208 --> 00:18:05.750
In the shop window at the mall.

211
00:18:09.375 --> 00:18:11.375
Why did you take children?

212
00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:15.708
Couldn't you wait until they grow up?

213
00:18:16.458 --> 00:18:18.333
These are troubled times for the market.

214
00:18:19.125 --> 00:18:24.375
I had to convince the manager in the mall
to sell them for 3.50 rubles instead of 3.

215
00:18:28.625 --> 00:18:30.041
We're heading to Berlin.

216
00:18:32.458 --> 00:18:33.916
Good for you.

217
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.333
We're going fishing. To Oselya village.

218
00:18:37.416 --> 00:18:40.208
Drop dead in the damn Berlin.

219
00:18:40.291 --> 00:18:41.666
Have a good trip!

220
00:18:43.875 --> 00:18:45.041
What's that…

221
00:18:52.083 --> 00:18:53.833
Enjoy the silence. damn it!

222
00:18:53.916 --> 00:18:55.666
It was just fine yesterday.

223
00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:19.041
Are you crazy?

224
00:19:19.708 --> 00:19:21.291
What do you mean "Berlin"?

225
00:19:21.375 --> 00:19:24.666
We have a concert in three days.
Are you going to bail on us?

226
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:28.375
I swear. it's just to change the Pobeda.
and then I'll come back.

227
00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:30.041
It's Berlin.

228
00:19:30.583 --> 00:19:31.875
That's real Europe.

229
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.625
Wouldn't you go?

230
00:19:35.583 --> 00:19:36.583
Berlin…

231
00:19:38.333 --> 00:19:41.291
Three days before the concert?!
Kuzia. are you kidding me?!

232
00:19:41.375 --> 00:19:42.833
Of course. I wouldn't go!

233
00:19:42.916 --> 00:19:45.791
Guys. I swear. I won't let you down.

234
00:19:45.875 --> 00:19:47.375
Let's go!

235
00:19:48.708 --> 00:19:49.708
What happened?

236
00:19:52.333 --> 00:19:53.958
We have to push the car.

237
00:20:03.041 --> 00:20:04.041
Come on!

238
00:20:31.458 --> 00:20:32.708
That's it.

239
00:20:33.333 --> 00:20:34.416
Game over.

240
00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.958
Maybe we should start from the school #3?

241
00:20:44.041 --> 00:20:45.500
There is a hill there.

242
00:20:54.375 --> 00:20:55.666
So. Kuzia…

243
00:20:56.791 --> 00:20:58.041
Last shot?

244
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.208
Listen to me. you. Stalin-era rubbish.

245
00:21:06.333 --> 00:21:09.166
either you're going to Berlin
and become a part of the collection

246
00:21:10.041 --> 00:21:12.375
or you're not.
and you'll be sold for scrap.

247
00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:14.250
Got it?

248
00:21:22.333 --> 00:21:23.541
Come on. guys.

249
00:21:53.291 --> 00:21:54.916
Smart girl!

250
00:21:55.416 --> 00:21:58.333
- We're going West. man!
- To Berlin!

251
00:22:42.166 --> 00:22:47.083
<i>I'm driving fast</i>
<i>The Europe is waiting for me…</i>

252
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.791
Three days may not be enough.

253
00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:00.000
Maybe it's for the best.

254
00:23:03.166 --> 00:23:05.333
<i>I was glad to go with Bard.</i>

255
00:23:05.416 --> 00:23:08.291
<i>He wouldn't bother me with questions.</i>
<i>I was busy thinking.</i>

256
00:23:09.083 --> 00:23:11.125
<i>After the "amatOurship"…</i>

257
00:23:11.208 --> 00:23:13.208
<i>the word itself is disgusting…</i>

258
00:23:13.291 --> 00:23:16.125
<i>I decided to quit music. so what?</i>

259
00:23:16.208 --> 00:23:18.125
<i>Everybody's in trade. why shouldn't I?</i>

260
00:23:21.291 --> 00:23:23.916
<i>The miners' protests in Donetsk continue.</i>

261
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.166
<i>You are listening to "Parliamentary wave".</i>

262
00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:29.375
I am so sick of the politics.

263
00:23:29.458 --> 00:23:32.625
They're just beating the air.
It's been two years already.

264
00:23:32.708 --> 00:23:34.083
Aren't you tired of it?

265
00:24:33.666 --> 00:24:35.000
Crap!

266
00:24:40.375 --> 00:24:41.458
So?

267
00:24:44.041 --> 00:24:45.291
We're screwed.

268
00:24:56.166 --> 00:24:57.666
Damn. get behind the wheel!

269
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:03.625
- I'll wind up and you hit the gas!
- Okay!

270
00:25:05.041 --> 00:25:07.416
- Did you hit it?
- You wound it. I hit it. right?

271
00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.833
No! Hit and hold it.
I'll wind one more time.

272
00:25:15.125 --> 00:25:16.375
Save the children!

273
00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:20.833
Start pushing!

274
00:25:20.916 --> 00:25:22.416
- What?
- Go there!

275
00:26:03.291 --> 00:26:05.458
<i>I woke up early today</i>

276
00:26:05.541 --> 00:26:07.750
<i>I'll go to the mountains</i>

277
00:26:07.833 --> 00:26:11.291
<i>I left my TV set</i>

278
00:26:12.083 --> 00:26:16.541
<i>I'm in the place where the wind</i>

279
00:26:16.625 --> 00:26:20.125
<i>Tracing out letters over the water</i>

280
00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:23.250
Is it yours?

281
00:26:23.333 --> 00:26:25.125
Yeah. write it down somewhere.

282
00:26:26.125 --> 00:26:27.750
Did you call the customs?

283
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.416
Won't there be any problems?

284
00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:33.875
Of course. my classmate Fedya works there.
he knows everything.

285
00:26:34.708 --> 00:26:35.708
Okay.

286
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.041
The whole Ukraine
is going to Poland today or what?

287
00:26:55.125 --> 00:26:58.208
No. It's Fedya's birthday today

288
00:26:58.291 --> 00:27:01.208
and the customs are a bit paralyzed.

289
00:27:01.291 --> 00:27:03.791
But Fedya promised to help us get through.

290
00:27:04.541 --> 00:27:06.041
There he is.

291
00:27:06.125 --> 00:27:07.875
The gate bar director.

292
00:27:15.875 --> 00:27:18.708
Hello. gentlemen!
What do you have back there?

293
00:27:18.791 --> 00:27:20.291
It's all right. officer.

294
00:27:20.375 --> 00:27:21.583
Call Fedya.

295
00:27:21.666 --> 00:27:23.208
All right?

296
00:27:23.291 --> 00:27:24.916
Let's check it.

297
00:27:28.416 --> 00:27:29.416
Crap!

298
00:27:30.291 --> 00:27:32.541
Guys. you can't carry dead children.

299
00:27:32.625 --> 00:27:33.750
It's a border.

300
00:27:33.833 --> 00:27:35.833
Pertovych! Why are you here?

301
00:27:35.916 --> 00:27:37.166
Get up!

302
00:27:37.666 --> 00:27:39.833
You'll miss all the toasts.

303
00:27:40.625 --> 00:27:43.125
They won't dare!

304
00:27:48.791 --> 00:27:50.166
Hi. smugglers!

305
00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:52.916
Where have you been?
I've been waiting for you since morning.

306
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.500
Happy birthday. man!

307
00:27:54.583 --> 00:27:56.083
You got fat!

308
00:27:56.166 --> 00:27:57.500
It's because of the stress.

309
00:27:58.166 --> 00:27:59.916
Did you bring the kickback?

310
00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:03.791
Listen… I'm broke.
The buddy's paying for the fuel.

311
00:28:04.666 --> 00:28:05.875
You can't go like that.

312
00:28:05.958 --> 00:28:09.791
I'll bring everything on my way back.

313
00:28:09.875 --> 00:28:12.416
Cover the hand.

314
00:28:15.125 --> 00:28:17.166
Give me that so that everybody sees it.

315
00:28:18.416 --> 00:28:19.833
Like you're giving a bribe.

316
00:28:31.416 --> 00:28:36.625
Please. accept this charitable donation.
For the stationery.

317
00:28:36.708 --> 00:28:39.541
Okay. fine.
I'll get broke having such friends.

318
00:28:42.041 --> 00:28:43.791
{\an8}CUSTOMS DECLARATION

319
00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:46.250
Thank you. man!

320
00:28:46.833 --> 00:28:48.833
I'm at the service of Ukrainian people!

321
00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:02.333
- You're not feeling well?
- What?

322
00:29:02.416 --> 00:29:05.791
Why do you keep fidgeting?
You have to keep cool at the border.

323
00:29:06.916 --> 00:29:08.000
Like that?

324
00:29:08.708 --> 00:29:09.958
Sort of.

325
00:29:13.625 --> 00:29:14.833
What are we waiting for?

326
00:29:15.666 --> 00:29:17.583
Turn off your Dinosaur.

327
00:29:17.666 --> 00:29:20.375
If I turn it off now. it won't start.
Is that what you want?

328
00:29:24.041 --> 00:29:25.541
Turn off the engine.

329
00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:35.666
Where are you going?

330
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:37.833
To Berlin. to a festival.

331
00:29:37.916 --> 00:29:39.666
One-man show.

332
00:29:41.166 --> 00:29:43.958
The man in sunglasses is the actor.

333
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.250
The mannequins are for the stage design.

334
00:29:48.291 --> 00:29:49.666
And I'm his helper.

335
00:29:57.958 --> 00:30:00.291
<i>He didn't care about the mannequins.</i>

336
00:30:00.375 --> 00:30:02.291
<i>He was looking for drugs.</i>

337
00:30:03.708 --> 00:30:05.041
Show me what's there.

338
00:30:13.958 --> 00:30:16.333
<i>But there could be anything. even a horse.</i>

339
00:30:16.416 --> 00:30:18.375
<i>And you'd have troubles finding it.</i>

340
00:30:26.958 --> 00:30:28.083
You can go.

341
00:30:28.166 --> 00:30:29.375
Thank you very much.

342
00:30:31.416 --> 00:30:33.958
Bard. You'll have to push the car.

343
00:30:34.041 --> 00:30:37.958
If I take out the crank at Polish customs.
we'll get deported for good.

344
00:30:38.041 --> 00:30:39.750
Of course.

345
00:30:45.291 --> 00:30:47.041
Drive. don't push it!

346
00:30:54.125 --> 00:30:55.916
Open! Hurry up!

347
00:31:11.916 --> 00:31:13.166
It's nuts!

348
00:31:57.791 --> 00:31:58.791
Oops.

349
00:31:59.708 --> 00:32:00.791
What's wrong?

350
00:32:03.125 --> 00:32:04.125
The fuel.

351
00:32:05.041 --> 00:32:06.625
Didn't you fill up the tank?

352
00:32:07.125 --> 00:32:08.791
I thought we had enough.

353
00:32:13.666 --> 00:32:15.125
That's a dead end. Kuzma.

354
00:32:16.666 --> 00:32:17.666
Someone will stop.

355
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:19.291
No. no one will.

356
00:32:19.375 --> 00:32:22.083
In Poland. they don't stop
for some strangers.

357
00:32:22.166 --> 00:32:23.458
Especially. for us.

358
00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:25.875
What if…

359
00:32:26.916 --> 00:32:28.125
you're a racketeer.

360
00:32:37.458 --> 00:32:38.541
Damn it!

361
00:32:48.083 --> 00:32:49.375
Kurwa!

362
00:32:50.041 --> 00:32:52.208
Where did this car come from?

363
00:32:55.166 --> 00:32:56.416
It's a tank. kurwa.

364
00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:58.250
My uncle once got drunk

365
00:32:58.333 --> 00:33:01.208
and broke the neighbor’s fence
driving a car like that.

366
00:33:01.291 --> 00:33:03.458
And it didn't even leave a scratch.

367
00:33:06.625 --> 00:33:09.291
It's not a tank. It's a Warszawa.

368
00:33:09.375 --> 00:33:11.375
That's what I was saying.

369
00:33:11.458 --> 00:33:13.125
These Polish people…

370
00:33:13.208 --> 00:33:17.625
They don't get that their Warszawa
is just a copy of our Pobeda.

371
00:33:18.416 --> 00:33:21.541
Can you hear them
using "kurwa" all the time?

372
00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:26.666
In our language
we invented a comma instead of it.

373
00:33:27.791 --> 00:33:29.458
That's what I'm saying.

374
00:33:29.541 --> 00:33:30.541
Kurwa.

375
00:33:30.625 --> 00:33:31.916
O. kurwa.

376
00:33:50.958 --> 00:33:51.958
Catch!

377
00:34:02.708 --> 00:34:04.166
The battery's dead.

378
00:34:05.833 --> 00:34:07.291
What battery?

379
00:34:08.041 --> 00:34:10.916
Hey. where are you going?
We need to get going.

380
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:13.500
Hey. boss.

381
00:34:16.041 --> 00:34:17.458
A racketeer from Ukraine?

382
00:34:18.208 --> 00:34:19.541
I don't have money.

383
00:34:19.625 --> 00:34:20.875
I don't need money.

384
00:34:23.458 --> 00:34:24.833
Can I take a look?

385
00:34:34.666 --> 00:34:36.375
The hose is damaged.

386
00:34:37.166 --> 00:34:39.333
Wait. Here.

387
00:35:03.416 --> 00:35:04.333
Try it!

388
00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:10.791
That's a song!

389
00:35:13.208 --> 00:35:14.708
You're a lifesaver.

390
00:35:18.458 --> 00:35:19.750
Wait.

391
00:35:23.541 --> 00:35:24.916
I'll get going. bye!

392
00:35:25.916 --> 00:35:27.208
Wait!

393
00:35:32.291 --> 00:35:34.958
I heard you like Polish ham in Ukraine.

394
00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.708
You can sell it and earn some money.

395
00:35:40.958 --> 00:35:41.958
Thank you.

396
00:35:43.416 --> 00:35:44.750
No. I should thank you.

397
00:35:47.416 --> 00:35:48.583
Beginner's luck.

398
00:35:54.416 --> 00:35:57.416
<i>It's obvious now.</i>

399
00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.333
<i>I should be an entrepreneur.</i>

400
00:35:59.416 --> 00:36:01.791
<i>Or a businessman.</i>

401
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:04.541
<i>Barbara will like it.</i>

402
00:36:18.208 --> 00:36:21.583
Ugh. when did you eat so much garlic?

403
00:36:21.666 --> 00:36:25.958
You were going around saying
that lard and garlic are for losers.

404
00:36:29.708 --> 00:36:30.958
I didn't eat it.

405
00:36:31.041 --> 00:36:32.458
It's a cold remedy.

406
00:36:33.583 --> 00:36:35.000
Does it stink so much?

407
00:36:35.625 --> 00:36:36.958
Well. yeah.

408
00:36:42.041 --> 00:36:43.125
Ugh!

409
00:36:44.833 --> 00:36:46.666
No. close the door.

410
00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:48.958
I mean it. close the door. I'm not joking.

411
00:36:53.291 --> 00:36:55.875
Ugh! Holy garlic!

412
00:36:57.125 --> 00:37:01.000
It's fine. Maybe. it will scare off
the fascists from your "Pobeda".

413
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.458
Car registration documents.

414
00:37:28.166 --> 00:37:29.250
Yes.

415
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.083
What's that?

416
00:37:39.666 --> 00:37:40.833
That's a car.

417
00:37:41.625 --> 00:37:43.166
No. what's that?

418
00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:45.791
That's a registration certificate.

419
00:37:53.833 --> 00:37:57.375
<i>I hated the words ending with -urück</i>
<i>since I was a child.</i>

420
00:37:57.458 --> 00:38:01.333
<i>Our adventure was now</i>
<i>showing signs of a force majeure.</i>

421
00:38:07.708 --> 00:38:09.541
Stop eating chips at the customs.

422
00:38:09.625 --> 00:38:11.083
Don't panic.

423
00:38:12.083 --> 00:38:13.958
You said it yourself we have to keep cool.

424
00:38:21.458 --> 00:38:22.708
Please. take a bit!

425
00:38:23.416 --> 00:38:25.000
He wants us to get out.

426
00:38:27.583 --> 00:38:28.625
Okay.

427
00:38:54.208 --> 00:38:55.125
Matilda!

428
00:39:00.041 --> 00:39:01.250
Come here!

429
00:39:06.625 --> 00:39:10.416
God. dear Lord. please save us…

430
00:39:14.125 --> 00:39:16.250
When did you become a believer?

431
00:39:23.583 --> 00:39:25.541
Are you afraid of dogs?

432
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:33.708
Hey. little one.

433
00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:38.458
You just smelled the chips?

434
00:39:40.666 --> 00:39:43.875
What are you doing!
You'll eat all the chips.

435
00:39:45.416 --> 00:39:46.333
No.

436
00:39:47.041 --> 00:39:51.375
If Matilda found nothing. let them go.

437
00:40:12.708 --> 00:40:15.375
Are you always so worried
about your mannequins?

438
00:40:19.333 --> 00:40:21.083
These are not just mannequins.

439
00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:25.541
What are they then?
Are there young terminators inside?

440
00:40:29.375 --> 00:40:30.375
No.

441
00:40:33.708 --> 00:40:35.333
There is Crimean Cannabis.

442
00:40:36.291 --> 00:40:37.500
Yeah. right.

443
00:40:45.083 --> 00:40:46.166
Are you serious?

444
00:40:50.791 --> 00:40:51.916
Man!

445
00:40:52.541 --> 00:40:54.000
We could end up in jail!

446
00:40:55.583 --> 00:40:58.916
It's not that much pot.
two years of probation tops.

447
00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:01.083
Are you nuts?

448
00:41:03.333 --> 00:41:04.625
You couldn't tell me?

449
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:09.375
Kuzia. if anything happened.
I'd take the fall.

450
00:42:07.333 --> 00:42:08.666
Look.

451
00:42:10.208 --> 00:42:11.416
Listen. Bard.

452
00:42:12.583 --> 00:42:14.166
Are you sure this is Berlin?

453
00:42:16.041 --> 00:42:18.666
Actually. this is Neukölln.

454
00:42:19.916 --> 00:42:23.958
Before the war.
it was a really fancy district.

455
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:28.000
But then. they built this Berlin wall.

456
00:42:28.083 --> 00:42:32.750
and it became less popular among bruggers.

457
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:36.166
And immigrants started settling here.

458
00:42:37.125 --> 00:42:38.041
Understand?

459
00:42:40.166 --> 00:42:43.416
Hey! Hey you. Aladdin!
Look where you're going!

460
00:43:24.125 --> 00:43:25.625
Tomas! Come here!

461
00:43:28.291 --> 00:43:30.375
Tomas is a yes man.

462
00:43:39.708 --> 00:43:40.875
Bard.

463
00:43:42.333 --> 00:43:44.666
- My dear friend!
- Tomas.

464
00:43:47.125 --> 00:43:48.458
Welcome!

465
00:43:49.291 --> 00:43:52.250
Tomas. this is Kuzma. my friend.

466
00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:55.291
Kuzma. this is Tomas. he's also my friend.

467
00:43:55.375 --> 00:43:56.875
- Yes?
- Yes. One moment.

468
00:43:59.208 --> 00:44:01.666
Tomas. take these two mannequins.

469
00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:06.041
Kuzma. two mannequins.

470
00:44:07.333 --> 00:44:10.333
Tomas. one more.

471
00:44:12.041 --> 00:44:13.375
One mannequin for me.

472
00:44:14.958 --> 00:44:16.041
Welcome!

473
00:44:28.791 --> 00:44:32.541
Listen. there are a lot of people here
and everything is common property here.

474
00:44:32.625 --> 00:44:35.250
So. you can just find a free spot
and crash there.

475
00:44:35.333 --> 00:44:36.666
Tomas have read too much Marks

476
00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:41.041
and thinks that his mission is
to give shelter to all the travelers.

477
00:44:44.708 --> 00:44:46.291
Hey. homies!

478
00:44:47.041 --> 00:44:49.958
Damn! Go to hell. jerks.

479
00:44:50.041 --> 00:44:51.416
We're trying to sleep.

480
00:44:51.916 --> 00:44:52.916
Bastards.

481
00:44:56.875 --> 00:44:57.875
Crash here.

482
00:45:06.958 --> 00:45:08.041
I'm home.

483
00:45:20.708 --> 00:45:22.583
Hello. beautiful!

484
00:45:23.583 --> 00:45:26.333
Kuzma. thanks for the compliment.

485
00:45:27.083 --> 00:45:29.625
Aunt Natalka.
could you get Barbara on the phone?

486
00:45:32.333 --> 00:45:35.125
Listen. she's busy now.

487
00:45:35.708 --> 00:45:37.041
<i>Okay.</i>

488
00:45:37.125 --> 00:45:39.666
<i>Then tell her</i>
<i>that I'll come back driving a Mercedes</i>

489
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:41.750
<i>and I decided to quit music.</i>

490
00:45:41.833 --> 00:45:45.166
I'll bring a batch of goods for sale.
I'll be a businessman.

491
00:45:45.666 --> 00:45:47.625
What do you mean "quit music"?

492
00:45:48.208 --> 00:45:49.625
Where are you. Kuzia?

493
00:45:52.208 --> 00:45:53.208
Hello?

494
00:45:59.291 --> 00:46:01.625
The subscriber
cannot be reached at the moment.

495
00:46:02.583 --> 00:46:04.708
He's is outside of your love covered area.

496
00:46:15.291 --> 00:46:17.708
Hey! Stay away from the car!

497
00:46:30.916 --> 00:46:32.625
Are you out of your mind. badgers?

498
00:46:32.708 --> 00:46:33.916
Get off the car!

499
00:46:38.625 --> 00:46:42.416
I'll tear your liver out
and feed it to the dogs!

500
00:46:45.375 --> 00:46:47.125
Why do you mess with him all alone?

501
00:46:47.208 --> 00:46:48.833
Don't you see they have protection?

502
00:46:48.916 --> 00:46:51.791
Keep cool and your time will come.

503
00:46:52.708 --> 00:46:53.958
Let's get out of here.

504
00:46:58.291 --> 00:46:59.291
Thank you.

505
00:47:00.666 --> 00:47:03.916
They won't come back
until the evening. that's for sure.

506
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.250
Tomas.

507
00:47:05.333 --> 00:47:06.500
Bard.

508
00:47:06.583 --> 00:47:09.416
Dude. when are we going to
exchange Pobeda for a Mercedes?

509
00:47:10.041 --> 00:47:13.750
They won't be back until the evening.
but after darkness…

510
00:47:14.583 --> 00:47:17.208
Kuzia. let me show you Berlin.
what do you think?

511
00:47:17.291 --> 00:47:18.708
See you. man.

512
00:47:18.791 --> 00:47:20.041
See you.

513
00:47:20.708 --> 00:47:21.708
Bye.

514
00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:48.791
Damn it!

515
00:48:49.291 --> 00:48:50.958
Then just leave it.

516
00:48:52.958 --> 00:48:58.500
Tomas. can you watch this car? Yeah?

517
00:49:00.666 --> 00:49:02.666
We'll be back soon.

518
00:49:03.916 --> 00:49:07.500
Yes. sure thing. no problem.

519
00:49:09.875 --> 00:49:12.166
- Of course!
- Well of course!

520
00:49:17.958 --> 00:49:19.708
Why are you sitting? Take them.

521
00:50:29.333 --> 00:50:31.375
Wow. what characters!

522
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:36.750
Hello.

523
00:50:39.458 --> 00:50:40.458
Excuse me.

524
00:50:40.541 --> 00:50:41.750
- Step away.
- Sorry.

525
00:50:43.375 --> 00:50:44.833
Make way. stripper.

526
00:50:47.916 --> 00:50:49.833
Look. we're like ships.

527
00:50:51.541 --> 00:50:52.833
Kuzma…

528
00:50:52.916 --> 00:50:53.916
Sorry.

529
00:50:55.333 --> 00:50:56.375
Excuse me.

530
00:51:02.208 --> 00:51:03.291
Wow!

531
00:51:03.916 --> 00:51:05.000
Excuse me.

532
00:51:06.291 --> 00:51:07.291
Sorry.

533
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.083
Glory to Jesus.

534
00:51:13.083 --> 00:51:14.958
Frankenstein. step back.

535
00:51:15.833 --> 00:51:16.958
Excuse me.

536
00:51:17.791 --> 00:51:18.750
Sorry.

537
00:51:19.291 --> 00:51:20.375
Good evening!

538
00:51:21.916 --> 00:51:23.083
Is Johann here?

539
00:51:24.541 --> 00:51:25.541
Come in.

540
00:51:30.375 --> 00:51:31.791
Good evening. gentlemen!

541
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:45.166
Hello. friend. You want something?

542
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.333
Listen. Bard.

543
00:51:54.416 --> 00:51:56.375
What does this Johann do?

544
00:51:56.958 --> 00:51:58.833
He is an art director in here.

545
00:51:58.916 --> 00:52:00.916
buys the mannequins.

546
00:53:16.666 --> 00:53:18.250
Good!

547
00:53:19.541 --> 00:53:21.250
This is good…

548
00:53:24.291 --> 00:53:25.916
Of course. it's good!

549
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.333
It's Crimean.

550
00:53:29.083 --> 00:53:31.250
And Crimea is a Ukrainian Columbia.

551
00:53:32.375 --> 00:53:33.458
Got it?

552
00:53:48.083 --> 00:53:50.083
Okay. but no more mannequins.

553
00:53:50.833 --> 00:53:51.916
What do you mean?

554
00:53:54.875 --> 00:53:57.166
My friends have already planted
a whole plot of land.

555
00:53:58.166 --> 00:54:00.541
Sorry. but Romanians
sell for half the price.

556
00:54:01.125 --> 00:54:02.375
Romanians?

557
00:54:02.458 --> 00:54:07.250
Our cannabis is the best
in Europe. understand?

558
00:54:10.041 --> 00:54:12.000
Our people don't care.

559
00:54:16.958 --> 00:54:17.875
Fascist.

560
00:54:18.458 --> 00:54:20.416
I still need him to exchange my Pobeda.

561
00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:21.500
It's not him.

562
00:54:23.333 --> 00:54:24.750
Excuse me. Johann.

563
00:54:25.541 --> 00:54:26.833
Where is Karsten?

564
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:29.000
He wasn't here today.

565
00:54:36.791 --> 00:54:40.125
Damn it. dude!
Two years of probation you said? Hey!

566
00:54:41.041 --> 00:54:45.375
There are tons of pot!
We could go to jail for 18 years!

567
00:54:45.458 --> 00:54:47.083
- But we didn't.
- Cool!

568
00:54:47.666 --> 00:54:49.541
- You're welcome!
- Hey!

569
00:54:50.333 --> 00:54:54.833
I could have ended up in jail
for half of my life because of your drugs!

570
00:54:54.916 --> 00:54:57.958
Maybe you should have told me
about the risks beforehand. no?!

571
00:54:58.041 --> 00:55:00.666
Calm down! Do you think I'm a child?

572
00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:03.291
I settled everything with our police
a long time ago.

573
00:55:03.375 --> 00:55:07.375
I they had arrested you. they would have
put you in a holding cell for two months.

574
00:55:07.458 --> 00:55:11.000
We'd give them 300 bucks and that's it!
It's a waste of money. of course!

575
00:55:11.083 --> 00:55:13.375
What do you mean
"put me in a holding cell"?

576
00:55:15.083 --> 00:55:16.333
It's your car. isn't it?

577
00:56:04.416 --> 00:56:07.166
No! Leave me alone!

578
00:56:10.625 --> 00:56:11.541
Hello!

579
00:56:11.625 --> 00:56:12.666
Hey!

580
00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:14.000
Let her go!

581
00:56:14.958 --> 00:56:17.916
I'm talking to you! Both of you! Go away!

582
00:56:43.416 --> 00:56:44.958
I know where Karsten is.

583
00:56:49.125 --> 00:56:50.458
It was for me!

584
00:57:15.291 --> 00:57:19.500
<i>It was the first and the only time</i>
<i>when I got hammered on drugs.</i>

585
00:57:54.125 --> 00:57:56.875
<i>Actually. it was the only time</i>
<i>when I tried this stuff.</i>

586
00:57:56.958 --> 00:57:59.583
<i>I'd say that it was awful and so on…</i>

587
00:57:59.666 --> 00:58:02.375
<i>But I just didn't remember anything.</i>

588
00:58:02.458 --> 00:58:03.583
Are you okay?

589
00:58:08.458 --> 00:58:09.375
Where's Bard?

590
00:58:11.291 --> 00:58:12.750
Where is my friend?

591
00:58:13.958 --> 00:58:16.500
Inside. He said he'd come in a minute.

592
00:58:18.458 --> 00:58:19.458
And…

593
00:58:20.833 --> 00:58:22.625
Where are we?

594
00:58:23.958 --> 00:58:25.583
By the club.

595
00:58:31.250 --> 00:58:32.750
So. what is your name?

596
00:58:32.833 --> 00:58:34.083
Den.

597
00:58:34.166 --> 00:58:35.250
Den?

598
00:58:35.833 --> 00:58:38.291
Deniz. It means "sea" in Turkish.

599
00:58:40.166 --> 00:58:41.166
Okay.

600
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:44.500
So. what is a Turkish girl
doing in a night club?

601
00:58:45.375 --> 00:58:46.541
So what?

602
00:58:47.208 --> 00:58:49.500
I'm a modern free girl. understand?

603
00:58:49.583 --> 00:58:50.500
Okay.

604
00:58:51.083 --> 00:58:52.166
Hey. Romeo.

605
00:58:53.416 --> 00:58:55.708
Let's go inside. They say Karsten is here.

606
00:58:56.791 --> 00:58:58.166
Let's get inside.

607
00:59:11.125 --> 00:59:14.000
Berd! What does this Karsten
actually do in life?

608
00:59:14.916 --> 00:59:16.291
Kuzia. are you serious?

609
00:59:16.375 --> 00:59:18.833
I was telling you about him
for the last half hour.

610
00:59:20.125 --> 00:59:21.250
Anyway…

611
00:59:22.083 --> 00:59:25.958
So. in Soviet times
he was a translator from Russian.

612
00:59:26.041 --> 00:59:28.083
Are you sure he'll be up for the exchange?

613
00:59:28.166 --> 00:59:29.000
Don't fret.

614
00:59:31.375 --> 00:59:35.333
Bard. I hope there'll be no more scams.

615
00:59:51.041 --> 00:59:52.416
Hi. Bruno!

616
00:59:54.250 --> 00:59:56.375
Did you like Karsten's friend?

617
01:00:12.458 --> 01:00:13.833
Hi. Karsten!

618
01:00:37.916 --> 01:00:40.541
You play like a real professional.

619
01:00:40.625 --> 01:00:42.666
Yeah. he's good.

620
01:00:49.458 --> 01:00:50.583
Come on…

621
01:00:53.166 --> 01:00:55.083
This is a real deal.

622
01:00:56.375 --> 01:00:57.791
Stratocaster.

623
01:00:59.333 --> 01:01:00.916
How much?

624
01:01:01.958 --> 01:01:03.958
I don't sell guitars.

625
01:01:05.208 --> 01:01:06.583
I get it.

626
01:01:09.125 --> 01:01:11.541
I quit music anyway.

627
01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:17.208
And I never said
I was exchanging Mercedez for Pobeda.

628
01:01:18.958 --> 01:01:20.583
What do you mean?

629
01:01:21.166 --> 01:01:22.750
I heard it myself.

630
01:01:24.125 --> 01:01:28.958
I said I knew a man
who can exchange Pobeda for Mercedez.

631
01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:31.875
Enjoy yourself!

632
01:01:31.958 --> 01:01:33.208
Cheers.

633
01:01:33.791 --> 01:01:34.916
Cheers.

634
01:01:38.041 --> 01:01:38.916
Listen.

635
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.833
And that guy…

636
01:01:41.416 --> 01:01:43.541
Are you sure he'll be up for the exchange?

637
01:01:43.625 --> 01:01:44.833
Rudi?

638
01:01:45.416 --> 01:01:46.666
Let's go see him.

639
01:01:46.750 --> 01:01:48.291
I saw him here today.

640
01:01:54.125 --> 01:01:55.916
Is he dead or alive?

641
01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.541
What happened to him? Is he alive?

642
01:01:58.625 --> 01:02:00.916
He is. A bit.

643
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.708
He got high as a kite.

644
01:02:04.208 --> 01:02:07.208
What should we do?
Maybe we should call an ambulance?

645
01:02:07.291 --> 01:02:10.250
Yeah? Maybe the local police too?

646
01:02:10.333 --> 01:02:12.666
So all of these freaks would lynch us.

647
01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:15.333
We just need to wait
for this body to wake up.

648
01:02:15.416 --> 01:02:17.291
Yeah. or kick the bucket.

649
01:02:19.375 --> 01:02:20.375
Hey!

650
01:02:22.041 --> 01:02:24.125
Someone half passes here all the time.

651
01:02:24.208 --> 01:02:26.083
There should be some antidotes here.

652
01:02:26.166 --> 01:02:27.583
The girl is right.

653
01:02:31.541 --> 01:02:33.583
- Crap!
- Let's get out of here.

654
01:02:34.208 --> 01:02:35.416
We have to find an antidote!

655
01:02:59.250 --> 01:03:01.416
Naloxone. Naloxone?

656
01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:02.583
It must help.

657
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.416
- Do you know how to give an injection?
- Only to myself.

658
01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:09.666
I know how. I made it to my grandpa.

659
01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:12.166
You made your grandfather in…

660
01:03:12.250 --> 01:03:14.916
Did you give your grandfather
an injection in vein?

661
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.583
Yes. in the buttocks.

662
01:03:54.625 --> 01:03:57.125
<i>I loved them all so much in that moment.</i>

663
01:03:57.208 --> 01:04:00.583
<i>As if I knew them my whole life.</i>
<i>And there was no one dearer to me.</i>

664
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.333
<i>Plus I was drunk as a skunk.</i>

665
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.291
What should we do next?

666
01:04:08.375 --> 01:04:11.583
Let's go.
I'll introduce you to the musicians.

667
01:04:12.666 --> 01:04:14.875
I'll wait until he gets back to reality.

668
01:04:24.833 --> 01:04:25.875
Wow.

669
01:04:26.791 --> 01:04:28.250
Did Depeche Mode perform here?

670
01:04:28.333 --> 01:04:30.583
No. they were resting here.

671
01:04:30.666 --> 01:04:32.750
They performed
in the Friedrichstadt-Palast.

672
01:04:32.833 --> 01:04:36.166
- Have you been there?
- Of course. I paid 300 marks.

673
01:04:36.250 --> 01:04:38.625
Had to buy it from a reseller.

674
01:04:38.708 --> 01:04:40.458
I'm a huge fan!

675
01:04:42.375 --> 01:04:44.208
They inspire me.

676
01:04:46.583 --> 01:04:48.916
Inspire to sell ham?

677
01:04:50.958 --> 01:04:53.000
Why are you standing here. let's go.

678
01:05:03.250 --> 01:05:04.333
Hi. Eric!

679
01:05:04.416 --> 01:05:05.458
Hi!

680
01:05:05.541 --> 01:05:08.875
This is Eric. my friend.
Let's go. I'll introduce you.

681
01:05:12.833 --> 01:05:15.416
This is Kuzma. my friend from Ukraine.

682
01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:16.583
He's a rock musician.

683
01:05:17.125 --> 01:05:18.291
Oh. a colleague.

684
01:05:18.875 --> 01:05:20.375
Let's play together.

685
01:05:20.916 --> 01:05:23.000
No. guys. I gave up music.

686
01:05:23.083 --> 01:05:24.750
I don't even have a guitar.

687
01:05:24.833 --> 01:05:26.250
It's not a problem.

688
01:05:27.333 --> 01:05:28.541
You can take mine.

689
01:06:48.125 --> 01:06:51.416
<i>That was the moment when I realized</i>
<i>that I could not escape it.</i>

690
01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:54.166
<i>I'll find common ground with anyone</i>
<i>as long as there is music.</i>

691
01:06:54.250 --> 01:06:57.291
<i>And I'll be able to do</i>
<i>whatever I wish. No limits.</i>

692
01:07:14.666 --> 01:07:16.875
<i>It's not so important</i>
<i>how many fans you have.</i>

693
01:07:16.958 --> 01:07:19.541
<i>If these five people</i>
<i>gave you their hearts.</i>

694
01:07:19.625 --> 01:07:22.500
<i>And music is everything.</i>

695
01:07:22.583 --> 01:07:24.333
<i>Polish ham? Who am I kidding.</i>

696
01:08:07.208 --> 01:08:08.416
It was amazing.

697
01:08:11.458 --> 01:08:12.458
Yeah.

698
01:08:15.333 --> 01:08:18.708
You're fucking sexy! You're a rock star!

699
01:08:20.333 --> 01:08:22.750
Why did you quit? You have a talent.

700
01:08:24.416 --> 01:08:26.916
Karsten. that's just
thanks to your guitar.

701
01:08:33.041 --> 01:08:34.083
We can go.

702
01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:54.500
Kuzma.

703
01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:55.916
Yes.

704
01:08:58.125 --> 01:09:01.166
Rudi is very grateful
that you saved his life.

705
01:09:02.458 --> 01:09:04.916
And I convinced him to switch cars.

706
01:09:08.166 --> 01:09:09.208
Yes. Rudi?

707
01:09:09.291 --> 01:09:10.375
Rud. Rudi…

708
01:09:11.041 --> 01:09:13.416
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes.

709
01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:16.458
Let's go then.
We have to go home in a few hours.

710
01:09:16.541 --> 01:09:18.666
I have a concert tomorrow in the evening.

711
01:09:20.750 --> 01:09:21.833
Cool!

712
01:09:21.916 --> 01:09:22.916
Right.

713
01:09:24.750 --> 01:09:26.166
How are we going to get there?

714
01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:33.916
Den. where are you from?

715
01:09:34.416 --> 01:09:36.791
Kreuzberg. Hermannplatz. 4.

716
01:09:36.875 --> 01:09:39.458
Kreuzberg? Little Istanbul!

717
01:09:40.166 --> 01:09:41.666
That's not far from us.

718
01:09:59.583 --> 01:10:02.041
All right. Thank you. guys.

719
01:10:02.875 --> 01:10:04.208
Goodbye!

720
01:10:04.291 --> 01:10:05.375
Bye. Den.

721
01:10:07.083 --> 01:10:10.083
- Bye. Kuzma.
- Bye. Den. It was nice to meet you.

722
01:10:10.166 --> 01:10:12.375
Nice… to what?

723
01:10:13.291 --> 01:10:15.833
Get out. say a proper goodbye.

724
01:10:18.166 --> 01:10:20.000
Don't worry. I won't tell Barbara.

725
01:10:30.375 --> 01:10:33.208
Okay. I'll try to help.

726
01:10:36.458 --> 01:10:38.625
One… two… three.

727
01:10:44.208 --> 01:10:45.291
Well…

728
01:10:45.833 --> 01:10:47.875
Thank you for helping me.

729
01:10:51.708 --> 01:10:53.833
You're a really pretty girl.

730
01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:56.250
I was glad to help you.

731
01:11:01.458 --> 01:11:02.750
I have to go.

732
01:11:03.541 --> 01:11:04.458
I understand.

733
01:11:08.250 --> 01:11:09.875
Maybe we'll see you later?

734
01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:12.416
Yeah.

735
01:11:23.541 --> 01:11:24.458
Bye. Den.

736
01:11:24.541 --> 01:11:25.500
Bye.

737
01:11:42.958 --> 01:11:43.916
What?

738
01:11:45.458 --> 01:11:46.666
Did you take her number?

739
01:11:48.166 --> 01:11:49.625
Let's go.

740
01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:35.750
Oh. God!

741
01:12:37.583 --> 01:12:39.166
What the hell is that?

742
01:12:42.791 --> 01:12:44.083
Beasts!

743
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:47.375
Freaking animals!

744
01:12:49.250 --> 01:12:51.875
Tomas! How could you let this happen?

745
01:12:53.166 --> 01:12:55.125
- What?
- You can shove your what!

746
01:12:55.208 --> 01:12:57.291
Look what these freaks did!

747
01:13:03.458 --> 01:13:04.708
That's a complete garbage.

748
01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:06.500
This is not a car.

749
01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:09.166
I won't take it.

750
01:13:11.041 --> 01:13:12.416
We're screwed.

751
01:13:13.666 --> 01:13:15.333
Bastards!

752
01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:25.791
Hey! Son of the jackal! You're dead.

753
01:13:26.666 --> 01:13:27.666
This can't be good.

754
01:13:29.416 --> 01:13:30.666
What are you doing?

755
01:13:32.333 --> 01:13:33.416
Tomas!

756
01:13:34.125 --> 01:13:35.125
Tomas!

757
01:13:36.875 --> 01:13:38.666
Tomas! Help us! Tomas! Tomas!

758
01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:41.250
What have you done? How will I get home?

759
01:13:41.333 --> 01:13:42.541
I have a concert!

760
01:13:42.625 --> 01:13:44.458
How did you even do it?

761
01:13:45.166 --> 01:13:46.291
Dear Mother!

762
01:13:46.375 --> 01:13:48.250
What did you say about my mother?

763
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:03.000
Eat this!

764
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.375
Sorry. Kuzma.
I don't do well with the police.

765
01:14:54.791 --> 01:14:56.875
We need some real help here.

766
01:15:12.333 --> 01:15:15.416
So. the police were going somewhere else.

767
01:15:19.041 --> 01:15:20.416
I'm going to bed.

768
01:15:22.250 --> 01:15:23.250
Yeah.

769
01:15:35.666 --> 01:15:38.958
<i>I knew that Yatsyk and Lesyk</i>
<i>would be expecting me this evening.</i>

770
01:15:39.041 --> 01:15:40.791
<i>Barbara would be expecting me.</i>

771
01:15:40.875 --> 01:15:42.458
<i>Maybe even some fans.</i>

772
01:15:43.083 --> 01:15:46.750
<i>But I had no idea how to get to Lviv.</i>

773
01:15:47.375 --> 01:15:50.458
<i>So I decided to think and to eat.</i>

774
01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:55.208
How can you eat here. dude?

775
01:15:57.333 --> 01:15:58.958
I don't know. was really hungry.

776
01:16:01.833 --> 01:16:04.208
You've eaten the ham
that'd cost 300 bucks. yeah?

777
01:16:05.416 --> 01:16:06.416
No.

778
01:16:07.916 --> 01:16:09.750
Around 5.50 for now.

779
01:16:11.291 --> 01:16:14.291
Mom! Somebody help! Guys!

780
01:16:14.375 --> 01:16:17.125
Could you help me? Help me. please.

781
01:16:17.208 --> 01:16:18.125
What happened?

782
01:16:18.208 --> 01:16:21.791
- Help my mom! Help her!
- Where is your mom?

783
01:16:49.458 --> 01:16:51.375
<i>That was a success…</i>

784
01:16:51.458 --> 01:16:53.583
<i>I never followed through on anything.</i>

785
01:16:54.125 --> 01:16:56.750
<i>I didn't get a new car.</i>
<i>the old one had some shit all over it.</i>

786
01:16:56.833 --> 01:16:58.916
<i>I was not gonna make it to the concert.</i>

787
01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.166
<i>and now they were going</i>
<i>to make me into ham.</i>

788
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.875
What the hell?

789
01:17:13.291 --> 01:17:14.250
Alyosha. translate.

790
01:17:16.416 --> 01:17:19.666
Sir Mehmed says
that he's very disappointed.

791
01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:21.833
You don't act like this
when you're a guest.

792
01:17:21.916 --> 01:17:26.125
You dared to raise a hand against
Sir Mehmed's nephew and his friends.

793
01:17:26.208 --> 01:17:28.416
They shit on my car!

794
01:17:29.208 --> 01:17:30.125
Translate it!

795
01:17:35.958 --> 01:17:38.625
My nephew said you were threatening him.
What's your version?

796
01:17:40.458 --> 01:17:44.041
Mehmed is not a killer.
He's just an entrepreneur.

797
01:17:44.125 --> 01:17:46.583
He sells clothes. shoes and so on.

798
01:17:47.083 --> 01:17:49.666
But what he cares about most
is his family's honor.

799
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:53.041
That's why you will die like dogs.

800
01:17:53.958 --> 01:17:55.833
Are you out of your mind?

801
01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.125
Alyosha! What does it mean?

802
01:17:59.208 --> 01:18:00.500
Let us go!

803
01:18:01.666 --> 01:18:04.916
If you don't want to start a dialogue.
I'll have to take extreme measures.

804
01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:09.291
Sir Mehmed asks if you have a last wish.

805
01:18:10.666 --> 01:18:13.916
Yeah! I want his nephew
to eat the shit he left on my car!

806
01:18:17.291 --> 01:18:19.875
Give them a good scare
and then we'll talk.

807
01:18:20.375 --> 01:18:21.333
Sorry. my friend.

808
01:18:22.666 --> 01:18:25.250
We'll have to cut off your head.

809
01:18:27.125 --> 01:18:28.875
Wait! Wait!

810
01:18:31.625 --> 01:18:32.750
Hey!

811
01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:35.625
Are you nuts?

812
01:18:35.708 --> 01:18:38.583
Boss! You're a grown man!

813
01:18:39.250 --> 01:18:41.666
Alyosha. stop him!

814
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:44.708
Fine. they don't have to eat the shit!

815
01:18:52.666 --> 01:18:54.750
- Good morning. dad!
- Good morning. daughter!

816
01:18:54.833 --> 01:18:59.041
Can you give me some money for a taxi.
I overslept and I'm late for university.

817
01:18:59.125 --> 01:19:00.833
- Yes. sure.
- Den?

818
01:19:00.916 --> 01:19:02.000
Kuzma?

819
01:19:02.083 --> 01:19:03.625
How do you know this rude man?

820
01:19:03.708 --> 01:19:06.333
Dad! He saved me from attackers
yesterday in the evening.

821
01:19:06.416 --> 01:19:10.166
What attackers?
Why were you alone outside?

822
01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:14.875
I was coming back home from the library.
two people attacked me.

823
01:19:15.625 --> 01:19:18.208
and this brave man saved me from them.

824
01:19:18.708 --> 01:19:20.291
Untie this guy.

825
01:19:20.375 --> 01:19:22.625
- What about his friend?
- And his friend.

826
01:19:35.125 --> 01:19:36.291
Hi. Kuzma!

827
01:19:37.875 --> 01:19:39.291
How are you?

828
01:19:39.375 --> 01:19:41.750
Thank you! I'm fine. damn it.

829
01:19:43.458 --> 01:19:45.458
Apologize and ask how to thank him.

830
01:19:45.541 --> 01:19:48.833
For saving the honor
of Sir Mehmed's only daughter.

831
01:19:49.708 --> 01:19:52.916
Sir Mehmed would like to offer
his sincere apologies.

832
01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:55.625
And he asks: what would you like to get?

833
01:19:57.625 --> 01:20:01.083
I want my car
to be as good as new. Get it?

834
01:20:04.791 --> 01:20:06.583
Maybe he wants something special?

835
01:20:06.666 --> 01:20:10.083
Maybe you have a special wish?

836
01:20:20.375 --> 01:20:23.000
Tights. For my girlfriend.

837
01:20:23.916 --> 01:20:24.916
And…

838
01:20:27.125 --> 01:20:29.208
can I get my glasses back?

839
01:20:34.083 --> 01:20:35.166
Thank you.

840
01:20:40.916 --> 01:20:42.708
You have a girlfriend. Kuzma?

841
01:20:43.208 --> 01:20:44.208
Yes.

842
01:20:44.958 --> 01:20:46.708
Her name is Barbara.

843
01:20:48.875 --> 01:20:50.125
Have a good trip.

844
01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:57.291
I wish they'd had cut your balls off.

845
01:21:30.750 --> 01:21:31.958
This is for you.

846
01:21:35.666 --> 01:21:37.333
Couldn't you ask for a Mercedez?

847
01:21:38.666 --> 01:21:40.000
Was that an option?

848
01:21:40.541 --> 01:21:42.250
It was nice to meet you.

849
01:21:43.375 --> 01:21:44.583
I've no doubts.

850
01:22:20.875 --> 01:22:22.250
Karsten!

851
01:22:29.125 --> 01:22:31.041
I wanted to say thank you.

852
01:22:31.125 --> 01:22:32.625
For saving me.

853
01:22:34.875 --> 01:22:36.208
This is for you.

854
01:22:36.958 --> 01:22:39.083
No. no. It's too expensive.

855
01:22:39.166 --> 01:22:42.458
No. A new model comes out this week.

856
01:22:43.041 --> 01:22:44.416
I've already ordered it.

857
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.083
Take it.

858
01:22:48.208 --> 01:22:49.416
Take it.

859
01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:50.833
Thank you!

860
01:22:50.916 --> 01:22:52.000
Man!

861
01:22:56.208 --> 01:22:57.208
Thanks.

862
01:22:59.125 --> 01:23:00.208
Hey. boss!

863
01:23:01.333 --> 01:23:02.416
Done!

864
01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:16.750
Good.

865
01:23:20.750 --> 01:23:21.750
Good.

866
01:23:29.708 --> 01:23:30.958
What happened?

867
01:23:35.125 --> 01:23:37.291
Oh. I get it.

868
01:23:45.250 --> 01:23:46.250
Well…

869
01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.166
Thank you. guys!

870
01:23:52.666 --> 01:23:53.750
You can go.

871
01:23:58.041 --> 01:23:59.250
Badgers.

872
01:24:07.291 --> 01:24:08.750
That's all we've got.

873
01:24:08.833 --> 01:24:09.958
It's fine.

874
01:24:11.791 --> 01:24:13.625
Barbara will use it for decades.

875
01:24:22.875 --> 01:24:23.708
Very good!

876
01:24:25.583 --> 01:24:26.583
Guys!

877
01:24:27.750 --> 01:24:29.583
Just look at this beauty!

878
01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:32.791
Let's go to Rudi.

879
01:24:33.666 --> 01:24:37.375
- Maybe he'll take it for a Mercedez.
- We can try.

880
01:24:49.333 --> 01:24:51.666
Karsten! Who owns this?

881
01:25:00.583 --> 01:25:01.583
This?

882
01:25:02.166 --> 01:25:03.708
Nobody owns it.

883
01:25:04.875 --> 01:25:09.958
The owners put it here.
so that anyone in need could take it.

884
01:25:10.916 --> 01:25:14.250
- I'm in need.
- Calm down. We don't have time.

885
01:25:29.250 --> 01:25:31.583
I can have whatever I want?

886
01:25:32.291 --> 01:25:33.541
Hi. Rudi!

887
01:25:36.041 --> 01:25:37.416
Hello! It's me!

888
01:25:38.375 --> 01:25:39.375
Look!

889
01:25:40.166 --> 01:25:41.875
We fixed the car!

890
01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.250
Maybe… how to say it… we change?

891
01:26:01.083 --> 01:26:02.083
No.

892
01:26:04.291 --> 01:26:05.916
It's not even running.

893
01:26:07.041 --> 01:26:08.833
Oh my God! Honey!

894
01:26:08.916 --> 01:26:11.541
I can't believe this Warszawa is for me!

895
01:26:12.791 --> 01:26:15.291
It was my dream! Thank you!

896
01:26:17.291 --> 01:26:19.541
I wanted it so much!

897
01:26:19.625 --> 01:26:23.041
I'll be very grateful to you!

898
01:26:24.166 --> 01:26:26.500
- I'll do everything for you. dear.
- For me?

899
01:26:26.583 --> 01:26:27.666
Sure!

900
01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:29.041
Cool!

901
01:26:34.666 --> 01:26:35.666
Okay.

902
01:26:36.333 --> 01:26:38.458
Let's go. I'll show you the Mercedez.

903
01:26:41.583 --> 01:26:44.500
My grandpa had exactly the same.

904
01:26:59.416 --> 01:27:00.500
Here it is.

905
01:27:01.541 --> 01:27:02.791
My collection.

906
01:27:06.833 --> 01:27:08.041
A small part of it.

907
01:27:20.416 --> 01:27:21.625
Cool.

908
01:27:23.125 --> 01:27:24.291
And where is Mercedez?

909
01:27:31.333 --> 01:27:32.541
There you go.

910
01:27:40.666 --> 01:27:43.458
Well…

911
01:27:45.083 --> 01:27:46.291
a Mercedez.

912
01:27:55.416 --> 01:27:57.500
Man… A Mercedez?

913
01:27:58.291 --> 01:27:59.458
Mercedez 600.

914
01:28:01.833 --> 01:28:03.291
Dude. it's a Mercedez!

915
01:28:14.958 --> 01:28:16.041
A Mercedez!

916
01:28:21.041 --> 01:28:22.041
Hello.

917
01:28:32.583 --> 01:28:34.041
Be a good girl.

918
01:28:36.916 --> 01:28:38.833
Kuzma! A Mercedez!

919
01:28:41.041 --> 01:28:43.083
I'm sorry! One moment!

920
01:28:43.166 --> 01:28:44.166
Karsten!

921
01:28:44.250 --> 01:28:45.875
Yes. mister.

922
01:28:45.958 --> 01:28:48.791
Bard! Don't just sit there.
Open the trunk.

923
01:28:53.708 --> 01:28:54.875
Fantastic!

924
01:28:54.958 --> 01:28:56.500
Look at all this space.

925
01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:01.166
Karsten! You will help me.
And you will wait.

926
01:29:03.958 --> 01:29:04.875
Bard!

927
01:29:05.958 --> 01:29:07.583
Don't embarrass yourself!

928
01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:13.500
Okay…

929
01:29:17.208 --> 01:29:19.416
- Thank you very much!
- You're welcome!

930
01:29:20.208 --> 01:29:21.666
That's a good deal.

931
01:29:22.375 --> 01:29:24.541
Yeah. for sure.

932
01:29:27.250 --> 01:29:29.375
Kuzma! Help us!

933
01:29:29.458 --> 01:29:31.791
Why are you standing there?
Get the car over here!

934
01:29:51.958 --> 01:29:54.500
That's it? Can we go now?

935
01:29:55.041 --> 01:29:57.625
Well. if they don't need
the mannequins anymore…

936
01:29:58.416 --> 01:30:00.125
I'll be selling second hand stuff.

937
01:30:00.875 --> 01:30:02.375
That's gonna be a goldmine!

938
01:30:04.750 --> 01:30:05.750
Kuzma.

939
01:30:06.250 --> 01:30:08.083
you should continue making music.

940
01:30:10.958 --> 01:30:12.625
And I will be "making" business.

941
01:30:13.666 --> 01:30:14.625
I know.

942
01:30:14.708 --> 01:30:16.208
Let's go. business.

943
01:30:28.166 --> 01:30:30.416
That's a great musician from Ukraine.

944
01:31:30.875 --> 01:31:33.375
Damn! We'll be waiting for a week here.

945
01:31:33.458 --> 01:31:34.791
I have a concert.

946
01:31:43.875 --> 01:31:45.208
Kuzia. look!

947
01:31:48.958 --> 01:31:50.208
Racketeers.

948
01:31:50.291 --> 01:31:51.458
Muggers.

949
01:31:52.083 --> 01:31:53.250
What should we do?

950
01:31:54.625 --> 01:31:56.458
If they ask. we don't have anything.

951
01:32:11.666 --> 01:32:14.541
Greetings from Lublin-Lviv brigade.

952
01:32:14.625 --> 01:32:16.625
What do you have in your truck. yobbos?

953
01:32:16.708 --> 01:32:17.750
What do you care?

954
01:32:17.833 --> 01:32:22.375
We control who's passing through here.
You have to pay us 200 zlotys. Got it?

955
01:32:22.875 --> 01:32:24.166
We don't have any dough!

956
01:32:26.708 --> 01:32:28.250
Then give us your goods.

957
01:32:28.333 --> 01:32:30.750
That's some trash
from the junkyard. fellas.

958
01:32:30.833 --> 01:32:33.833
You'll find the fellas on a playground!
We're guys.

959
01:32:33.916 --> 01:32:37.125
- That's really some trash. guys.
- Just open your truck. man.

960
01:32:37.208 --> 01:32:39.666
We'll take a look at your trash.

961
01:32:40.541 --> 01:32:41.458
Come on!

962
01:32:48.250 --> 01:32:51.083
- Wow. That's one hell of a TV.
- Take it.

963
01:32:51.708 --> 01:32:53.500
Take the plant. Come on.

964
01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:01.125
My business is doomed.

965
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.291
Better belly burst than good drink lost.

966
01:33:08.291 --> 01:33:09.958
Yobbos.

967
01:33:10.041 --> 01:33:12.666
I won't give away the guitar!
It's a very personal thing.

968
01:33:12.750 --> 01:33:14.666
And I won't give away the tights either!

969
01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:17.083
Is this also a personal thing?

970
01:33:19.333 --> 01:33:20.916
Are you a muso?

971
01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Yes.

972
01:33:22.833 --> 01:33:23.750
Fine.

973
01:33:24.333 --> 01:33:27.083
All right. We already have
some presents from you.

974
01:33:27.166 --> 01:33:31.833
You can keep one thing:
either the guitar or the tights.

975
01:33:34.083 --> 01:33:35.291
Bard.

976
01:33:35.375 --> 01:33:37.708
I promised Barbara to get red tights.

977
01:33:37.791 --> 01:33:39.708
Maybe. the hell with this guitar?

978
01:33:40.416 --> 01:33:41.875
Are you crazy?

979
01:33:41.958 --> 01:33:44.166
Keep the guitar. I'll find you the tights.

980
01:33:44.833 --> 01:33:45.916
I promise.

981
01:33:47.583 --> 01:33:48.583
Fine.

982
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.333
Give me back the guitar.

983
01:33:54.583 --> 01:33:55.583
Let's go.

984
01:34:00.958 --> 01:34:03.583
Hey! Fellas. Guys!

985
01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:06.666
Why are you running away
if you're so cool?

986
01:34:08.208 --> 01:34:11.083
You promised to help me
to get ahead of the line.

987
01:34:11.166 --> 01:34:12.291
And now what?

988
01:34:13.250 --> 01:34:16.333
- He's got some balls.
- If we don't help him. we'll "get soiled".

989
01:34:16.416 --> 01:34:18.666
Yeah… people will stop forking out.

990
01:34:22.625 --> 01:34:25.666
Sure. kiddo! We'll take care of it.

991
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:28.875
Kolya the sledgehammer walks the talk.

992
01:34:36.333 --> 01:34:40.000
Kiddo. I'll go first
and you'll follow me. Got it?

993
01:34:40.083 --> 01:34:43.791
I'll leave you near the border guard.
He'll know everything.

994
01:34:58.125 --> 01:34:59.166
Get in.

995
01:35:37.458 --> 01:35:39.083
- Hey. hey!
- Hello!

996
01:35:39.583 --> 01:35:41.000
You got the wheels?

997
01:35:41.083 --> 01:35:42.375
A Mercedez.

998
01:35:42.458 --> 01:35:44.375
I see. Congrats!

999
01:35:44.458 --> 01:35:45.500
Thank you!

1000
01:35:45.583 --> 01:35:47.625
Listen. can you hurry up
with the paperwork?

1001
01:35:47.708 --> 01:35:50.125
I'm late to a concert.

1002
01:35:50.208 --> 01:35:52.875
Congrats!
According to Ukrainian legislation

1003
01:35:52.958 --> 01:35:55.083
your Mercedez can't be cleared.

1004
01:35:55.166 --> 01:35:57.541
Because it's older than 10 years.

1005
01:35:57.625 --> 01:35:59.083
Since when do we have this rule?

1006
01:35:59.166 --> 01:36:01.541
Well. the law became effective yesterday.

1007
01:36:02.125 --> 01:36:03.916
- Fedya. are you kidding?
- Listen!

1008
01:36:05.125 --> 01:36:07.625
There's got to be a way
to get through. right?

1009
01:36:07.708 --> 01:36:10.750
You must have come up
with something already.

1010
01:36:10.833 --> 01:36:15.875
Fedya. let's be straight.
how much does the car clearing cost?

1011
01:36:15.958 --> 01:36:17.291
I'll pay for it.

1012
01:36:18.125 --> 01:36:19.083
Bard!

1013
01:36:20.041 --> 01:36:21.000
Bard!

1014
01:36:21.083 --> 01:36:22.916
Lend me some money. I'll give it back.

1015
01:36:28.625 --> 01:36:29.708
Some more.

1016
01:36:33.708 --> 01:36:34.625
Here!

1017
01:36:35.666 --> 01:36:37.166
Does everybody see it?

1018
01:36:37.250 --> 01:36:38.875
Show must go on!

1019
01:36:38.958 --> 01:36:40.041
Take it.

1020
01:36:40.666 --> 01:36:42.666
Calm down.

1021
01:36:42.750 --> 01:36:45.375
We'll register that
the car is in transit and that's it.

1022
01:36:45.458 --> 01:36:47.041
Everyone will be doing like that.

1023
01:36:51.250 --> 01:36:52.333
Crap!

1024
01:36:53.291 --> 01:36:54.625
Now I got into debt.

1025
01:36:54.708 --> 01:36:55.916
This Mercedez…

1026
01:36:57.375 --> 01:36:58.750
When Barbara sees it…

1027
01:37:00.541 --> 01:37:01.541
Bard.

1028
01:37:02.125 --> 01:37:05.125
Will you at least get me
those red tights that you promised?

1029
01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Bard!

1030
01:37:16.375 --> 01:37:18.708
You're a sharp cookie!

1031
01:37:20.791 --> 01:37:22.500
Kuzia! Are you out of your mind?

1032
01:37:22.583 --> 01:37:24.083
Yes. Are you out of your mind?

1033
01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:28.166
Someone has a concert in two hours
and you're kissing here.

1034
01:37:28.250 --> 01:37:31.208
Barbara. what are you doing here?

1035
01:37:31.750 --> 01:37:33.875
I knew that you'd be back for the concert.

1036
01:37:34.541 --> 01:37:36.375
Sorry. there's no orchestra.

1037
01:37:36.458 --> 01:37:38.541
The guys are busy. they have a rehearsal.

1038
01:37:44.583 --> 01:37:45.666
My love…

1039
01:37:48.125 --> 01:37:50.833
this is for you.
the red ones. as promised.

1040
01:38:04.375 --> 01:38:05.458
Is it yours?

1041
01:38:06.708 --> 01:38:07.708
Yes.

1042
01:38:12.875 --> 01:38:14.041
Will you give me a ride?

1043
01:39:48.166 --> 01:39:50.250
Thank you very much!

1044
01:39:50.791 --> 01:39:53.666
<i>I still had jitters before the concert.</i>

1045
01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:56.833
<i>But after our awesome trip I knew for sure</i>

1046
01:39:56.916 --> 01:39:58.875
<i>that my choice was right.</i>

1047
01:39:58.958 --> 01:40:00.416
<i>Plus. all tickets were sold out.</i>

1048
01:40:00.500 --> 01:40:03.208
<i>So. maybe we'll earn something</i>
<i>with this amatOurship.</i>

1049
01:40:03.708 --> 01:40:05.791
<i>I never got used to that word.</i>

1050
01:40:06.375 --> 01:40:07.625
Congrats!

1051
01:40:07.708 --> 01:40:09.458
Congrats! Congrats! Congrats!

1052
01:40:10.833 --> 01:40:12.916
You're so cool! Let's go! Come on!

1053
01:40:13.625 --> 01:40:15.208
- Take one.
- Carefully.

1054
01:40:15.291 --> 01:40:16.833
Carefully.

1055
01:40:16.916 --> 01:40:20.375
Well. you're awesome!

1056
01:40:20.458 --> 01:40:21.708
That part…

1057
01:40:21.791 --> 01:40:22.916
Thanks. dude!

1058
01:40:26.458 --> 01:40:29.416
But we need to stay focused.
We have to get going in three days.

1059
01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:31.708
- Where?
- Are you going to Berlin again?

1060
01:40:32.583 --> 01:40:35.000
No. it's a bit early
for you to go to Berlin.

1061
01:40:35.083 --> 01:40:36.333
But an encore…

1062
01:40:36.416 --> 01:40:39.000
Go ahead. People are waiting.

1063
01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:47.208
We'll have a tour:

1064
01:40:47.833 --> 01:40:50.541
Vorokhta. Halych. Terebovlia. Stryi!

1065
01:40:50.625 --> 01:40:52.083
Don't be silly! А tour…

1066
01:40:52.166 --> 01:40:54.625
A triumphant tour!
I've arranged everything.

1067
01:40:54.708 --> 01:40:59.041
- And how do you fit into all this?
- What do you mean? I'm your producer.

1068
01:40:59.625 --> 01:41:00.875
No need to thank me.

1069
01:41:00.958 --> 01:41:04.916
You'll do it when you guys
become super stars.

1070
01:41:05.416 --> 01:41:07.000
Are you serious?

1071
01:41:07.708 --> 01:41:09.291
Have I ever let you down?

1072
01:41:12.916 --> 01:41:15.583
Come on! Money won't earn itself!

1073
01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:05.458
