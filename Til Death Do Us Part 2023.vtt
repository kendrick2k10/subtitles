00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:51.084
The definition of love
is an intense feeling

4
00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:54.888
of affection and concern
toward another person.

5
00:00:56.656 --> 00:01:00.760
You know. now I have never
actually been in love.

6
00:01:02.028 --> 00:01:03.997
and Lord knows I've tried.

7
00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:05.031
No. that's not good.

8
00:01:05.031 --> 00:01:06.366
That's not good.

9
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.275
Seeing love happen for
one of my closest friends.

10
00:01:16.776 --> 00:01:19.212
that has been just
a beautiful thing.

11
00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:56.236
You look like
The Little Mermaid.

12
00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:08.014
You know. now that there
is a ring on my finger.

13
00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:12.585
I have to ask. what
took you so long?

14
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.455
Mm.

15
00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:16.289
I'm serious.

16
00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:19.492
I dunno.

17
00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:21.094
I guess just because it was
against university policy.

18
00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.629
Yeah. well that's
where we work.

19
00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:23.463
It's what we do.

20
00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:25.632
It's a job.

21
00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:27.467
And a job shouldn't
get to determine how
its employees live.

22
00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:28.968
as long as it doesn't
interfere with their work.

23
00:04:28.968 --> 00:04:30.103
They feel it does interfere.

24
00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:31.404
I mean. it makes sense.

25
00:04:32.805 --> 00:04:35.041
Everything gets
harder once emotions

26
00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:36.276
come into play. you know?

27
00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.779
That's why we
usually work alone.

28
00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:41.347
Usually.

29
00:04:41.347 --> 00:04:43.750
But we knew the policy
before we took the job.

30
00:04:45.251 --> 00:04:48.454
We were just kids
then. things change.

31
00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:49.622
People change.

32
00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:50.957
Yeah. but policy doesn't.

33
00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:57.330
You know. you are the
first partner I ever had.

34
00:04:58.531 --> 00:04:59.832
And the last.

35
00:05:24.857 --> 00:05:28.294
This all just feels
so surreal. you know?

36
00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:30.496
I don't want it to end.

37
00:05:34.567 --> 00:05:36.669
I hope it never has to.

38
00:05:40.973 --> 00:05:45.678
You know. I could really
use a drink right about now.

39
00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:47.180
I could always use a drink.

40
00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:51.317
and a dance.

41
00:05:51.317 --> 00:05:54.687
Oh. God. I'm an
awful dancer. you know?

42
00:05:54.687 --> 00:05:56.122
Don't I know it?

43
00:05:56.122 --> 00:05:57.423
Oh my God.

44
00:05:57.423 --> 00:05:59.559
She's a champagne queen here.

45
00:06:01.394 --> 00:06:04.063
Someone. please get this
woman a glass of champagne.

46
00:06:06.532 --> 00:06:07.700

That is true.

93
00:08:54.467 --> 00:08:57.503
Oh. it's our last day
tomorrow. unfortunately.

Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

It's been paradise. of course.

98
00:09:05.511 --> 00:09:06.512
No doubt.

99
00:09:06.512 --> 00:09:08.414
It's been great to...

100
00:09:08.414 --> 00:09:11.050
Somehow we have managed to
not get any fresh seafood

101
00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.218
since we've been here.

102
00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:14.620
Well ours here is excellent.

103
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.189
We catch it fresh out of the
water right back there daily.

104
00:09:17.189 --> 00:09:20.426
Oh. well. what he means
is he hasn't had a chance

105
00:09:20.426 --> 00:09:22.261
to catch it himself yet.

106
00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:24.931
He likes to pretend
he knows how to fish.

107
00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:25.932
What?

108
00:09:25.932 --> 00:09:27.767
I know how to fish.

109
00:09:27.767 --> 00:09:29.969
What. do you think we don't
fish back in merry old England?

110
00:09:29.969 --> 00:09:31.337
Brilliant water.

111
00:09:31.337 --> 00:09:32.605
Beautiful views.

112
00:09:32.605 --> 00:09:33.906
It's the thrill of the chase.

113
00:09:33.906 --> 00:09:35.074
You know?

114
00:09:35.074 --> 00:09:36.876
That is a perfect holiday.

115
00:09:36.876 --> 00:09:40.079
And I have been fishing since
I was just a little lad.

116
00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:41.614
Well he always
liked to fish too.

117
00:09:41.614 --> 00:09:44.283
but I always found
it incredibly boring.

118
00:09:44.283 --> 00:09:46.752
I'd rather sew.
and I hate sewing.

119
00:09:48.621 --> 00:09:50.523
Well if you're looking
to do the fishing yourself

120
00:09:50.523 --> 00:09:53.059
I'd recommend going down the
harbor and renting a boat.

121
00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:54.894
Just go down there
and ask around

122
00:09:54.894 --> 00:09:57.730
and somebody will be
willing to take you out.

123
00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.231
Mm. thank you.

124
00:09:59.231 --> 00:10:02.201
Yeah. I can do that
if I'm allowed.

125
00:10:02.201 --> 00:10:03.803
They're allowed too.

126
00:10:03.803 --> 00:10:06.005
No. I mean.

127
00:10:06.005 --> 00:10:07.106

128
00:10:07.106 --> 00:10:08.641

Absolutely not.

It's not necessary.
- My pleasure.

Hello?

191
00:18:28.307 --> 00:18:29.775
Well we found
your runaway bride.

192
00:18:31.043 --> 00:18:32.711
You were right. she's here.

193
00:18:32.711 --> 00:18:34.713
Right where you
said she would be.

194
00:18:34.713 --> 00:18:37.116
Her car is parked
right out front.

195
00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:38.817
I didn't even know
about the damn place.

196
00:18:38.817 --> 00:18:41.420
It's just where her mum
said she might be at.

197
00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.189
Just try and hold her
then until I get there.

198

The university already
knows about what happened.

199
00:18:46.758 --> 00:18:47.960
You thought they wouldn't?

200
00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.195
Well. I mean. geez.

201
00:18:50.195 --> 00:18:52.197
Half the staff was at
that church tonight.

202
00:18:52.197 --> 00:18:53.732
Yeah. well I'm gonna
try and talk to the Dean

203
00:18:53.732 --> 00:18:55.367

204
00:18:55.367 --> 00:18:56.201
You sure about that?

205
00:18:56.201 --> 00:18:58.070
Hm?

206
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:59.605
I mean. they've been bending
over backwards for you.

207
00:18:59.605 --> 00:19:02.141
I just. I don't know.
I don't see any way

208
00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:03.675

209
00:19:03.675 --> 00:19:05.177

really wants. you know.

210
00:19:05.177 --> 00:19:06.478

212
00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.349
It's my wedding night
for Christ's sake.

213
00:19:10.349 --> 00:19:12.084
You're supposed
to be my best man.

214
00:19:13.218 --> 00:19:14.753
Hmm.

215
00:19:14.753 --> 00:19:16.388
I just wanna
talk to her first.

216
00:19:16.388 --> 00:19:17.856

00:19:17.856 --> 00:19:19.992
I'll be
there as soon as I can.

218
00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:43.315
So he just. he wants us
to keep her here for now.

219
00:19:47.586 --> 00:19:49.188
He thinks
he's gonna get her back?

220
00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:52.391
Yeah. well. you know
our boy. he's in love.

221

What can I say?

222
00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.528
And love makes you
do some crazy things.

223
00:19:56.528 --> 00:19:58.997
You know the definition

224
00:19:58.997 --> 00:20:02.534
of love is an intense
feeling of affection.

225
00:20:02.534 --> 00:20:04.436
"The definition of love."

226
00:20:04.436 --> 00:20:07.039
Is that from your
best man's speech?

227
00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:09.808
You're not gonna torture us
with that shit again. are you?

228
00:20:13.979 --> 00:20:15.380
You know. being
somebody's best man

229
00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:18.417
is a job I take very seriously.

230
00:20:21.386 --> 00:20:23.388
And I worked my fucking ass
off on that thing so. yeah.

231

are arguing about a speech.

We're chasing after her.

233

Love is a liability.

234
00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:45.043

I got a match.

235
00:20:45.877 --> 00:20:47.713

We...

380
00:31:03.862 --> 00:31:05.930
We tried to be gentlemanly.

381
00:31:07.332 --> 00:31:09.267
Clearly she is not
going to make this easy.

382
00:31:10.268 --> 00:31:11.669
Oh.

383
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:13.104
And you thought she would?

384
00:31:13.104 --> 00:31:15.540
Well. like I
said. she's supposed

385
00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:16.808
to be one of our friends.

386
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:19.544
Were.

387
00:31:21.279 --> 00:31:23.514
Yeah. see. I knew we should
have brought our supplies.

388
00:31:23.514 --> 00:31:24.816
Relax.

389
00:31:26.251 --> 00:31:27.385
I mean. it's not like
she has anything either.

390
00:31:27.385 --> 00:31:28.519
Right?

391
00:31:28.519 --> 00:31:29.921
They were very clear.

392
00:31:29.921 --> 00:31:31.189
no guns at the wedding.

393
00:31:31.189 --> 00:31:33.057
Not even the cars.

394
00:31:33.057 --> 00:31:35.426
Second amendment be damned.

395
00:31:35.426 --> 00:31:37.395
Still we could have
at least stopped.

396
00:31:40.565 --> 00:31:41.399
Why?

397
00:31:42.867 --> 00:31:45.236
It's not like we're
here to kill anybody.

398
00:31:45.236 --> 00:31:47.238
I mean. not yet. right?

399
00:31:49.741 --> 00:31:52.043
Yeah. well I still
took mine to the wedding.

400
00:31:53.444 --> 00:31:54.712
I'd rather have my
utensils and need 'em

401
00:31:54.712 --> 00:31:56.915
than need 'em and not have 'em.

402
00:31:56.915 --> 00:31:57.916
Interesting.

403
00:31:57.916 --> 00:31:58.583
Well where are they?

404
00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:05.123
I left them in the van
when we took the car.

405
00:32:06.891 --> 00:32:08.426
So. wait a second.

406
00:32:08.426 --> 00:32:11.763
Have any of you
even seen her yet?

407
00:32:13.398 --> 00:32:15.133
She's somewhere in here.

408
00:32:15.133 --> 00:32:16.701
No shit.

409
00:32:17.936 --> 00:32:20.238
Why don't you go find her?

410
00:32:20.238 --> 00:32:21.606
Hmm?

411
00:32:21.606 --> 00:32:22.974
Guess I'll check upstairs.

412
00:32:24.809 --> 00:32:26.711
Guess I'll go with you.

413
00:32:26.711 --> 00:32:28.112
Ah. ah. ah. ah.

414
00:32:28.112 --> 00:32:30.949
Why don't I just
hang on to this?

415
00:32:33.584 --> 00:32:34.786
Yeah.

416
00:32:34.786 --> 00:32:35.620
Toodles.

417
00:32:40.358 --> 00:32:42.994
And I guess I'll
look around down here.

418
00:32:42.994 --> 00:32:45.830
And I shall find
some better music.

419
00:33:08.219 --> 00:33:10.288
Hey. newly weds.

420
00:33:11.155 --> 00:33:12.123
Hey.

421
00:33:12.123 --> 00:33:12.957
Oh. hey.

422
00:33:14.759 --> 00:33:17.195
We heard this was the best
breakfast spot in Puerto Rico.

423
00:33:17.195 --> 00:33:18.696
So we'd fill our bellies

424
00:33:18.696 --> 00:33:21.933
before we figure out
this fishing situation.

425
00:33:21.933 --> 00:33:24.535
Speaking of which. do you happen
to know where we could rent

426
00:33:24.535 --> 00:33:26.404
or charter a boat?

427
00:33:26.404 --> 00:33:28.172
Like the bartender
said last night.

428
00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:33.144
For fishing.

429
00:33:33.144 --> 00:33:34.345
Hmm.

430
00:33:34.345 --> 00:33:35.680
Yeah. No. not really.

431
00:33:37.081 --> 00:33:38.249
We're just passing
through. like you all.

432
00:33:38.249 --> 00:33:40.518
and I really wouldn't know.

433
00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:45.957
Hmm.

434
00:33:47.825 --> 00:33:49.027
I'll tell you what though.

435
00:33:50.395 --> 00:33:52.230
why don't you both
come out with us today?

436
00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:54.198
Spend the day with
us on our boat.

437
00:33:55.199 --> 00:33:56.200
Oh. no.

438
00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.036
We don't want to impose.

439
00:33:58.036 --> 00:34:00.171
Especially not if you guys
are just here on vacation too.

440
00:34:00.171 --> 00:34:01.539
Yeah. really appreciate
your offer but-

441
00:34:01.539 --> 00:34:03.808
This is every day for us.

442
00:34:03.808 --> 00:34:05.410
Come on now. be nice.

443
00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:08.179
Stop me from cleaning
the damn thing today.

444
00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:09.080
Come on.

445
00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:10.648
Of course.

446
00:34:10.648 --> 00:34:12.183
It'd be great to have
some young blood around.

447
00:34:12.183 --> 00:34:13.584
I mean we hardly
ever have company.

448
00:34:14.752 --> 00:34:17.055
Wait. you live on the boat?

449
00:34:17.055 --> 00:34:20.191
On the water.
wherever it takes us.

450
00:34:20.191 --> 00:34:21.659
Nowhere. Everywhere.

451
00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:23.561
Always an adventure.

452
00:34:24.862 --> 00:34:26.130
Well that's amazing.

453
00:34:27.732 --> 00:34:28.566
Yeah.

454
00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:30.435
You need a boat?

455
00:34:31.903 --> 00:34:34.138
The come on. let's
go to the boat.

456
00:34:35.073 --> 00:34:36.541
You need a boat. right?

457
00:34:36.541 --> 00:34:37.608
I got a boat.

458
00:34:38.576 --> 00:34:39.677
How about it?

459
00:34:42.146 --> 00:34:43.281
All right.

460
00:34:43.281 --> 00:34:44.715
Well all right.

461
00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:15.573
What do you
think you're doing?

462
00:36:15.573 --> 00:36:18.209
Just put down the knife.

463
00:36:18.209 --> 00:36:19.710
Well I was hoping
to have the night

464
00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:21.312
to figure it out a little more.

465
00:36:22.713 --> 00:36:24.982
Looks like you already
made your decision.

466
00:36:24.982 --> 00:36:25.983
Hmm.

467
00:36:25.983 --> 00:36:26.784
I'm working on it.

468
00:36:28.252 --> 00:36:29.987
You know. he told
us not to hurt you.

469
00:36:29.987 --> 00:36:32.190
He told you not to hurt me?

470
00:36:36.427 --> 00:36:37.795
Oh. that's nice.

471
00:38:50.561 --> 00:38:51.962
Meow.

472
00:38:54.932 --> 00:38:55.733
Meow.

473
00:38:58.169 --> 00:38:59.003
Meow.

474
00:39:03.207 --> 00:39:04.041
Oh.

475
00:39:05.576 --> 00:39:06.811
I just wanna talk.

476
00:39:07.878 --> 00:39:10.014
Well it's too late for that.

477
00:39:13.984 --> 00:39:15.653
What the hell
took you so long?

478
00:39:15.653 --> 00:39:17.121
That was a terrible idea.

479
00:39:17.121 --> 00:39:19.123
Froze my ass off.

480
00:39:19.123 --> 00:39:20.758
Hey. it was your idea. man.

481
00:39:20.758 --> 00:39:22.893
Next time you get
in the refrigerator.

482
00:39:22.893 --> 00:39:25.396
Next time you're
the distraction.

483
00:39:25.396 --> 00:39:26.597
Shut up. bitch.

484
00:39:46.884 --> 00:39:49.453
Fucking. bitch.

485
00:40:10.341 --> 00:40:12.343
Now you're really
gonna get it. bitch.

486
00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:14.779
You wanna play?

487
00:40:14.779 --> 00:40:16.380
Then let's play.

488
00:40:18.015 --> 00:40:20.484
You killed my friend.
you fucking bitch.

489
00:40:21.619 --> 00:40:23.387
You fucking psychopath.

490
00:40:23.387 --> 00:40:24.789
Hey. where you going?

491
00:40:24.789 --> 00:40:25.790
Where are you going?

492
00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:26.957
Don't you wanna play?

493
00:40:26.957 --> 00:40:28.459
Let's play with the devil. huh?

494
00:40:28.459 --> 00:40:29.460
Fuck!

495
00:40:30.194 --> 00:40:30.961
Huh!

496
00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:33.030
Fucking start!

497
00:40:34.365 --> 00:40:36.267
Get up.

498
00:40:36.267 --> 00:40:37.435
Get up. bitch.

499
00:40:37.435 --> 00:40:39.570
Get the fuck up. pussy cat.

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:41.472
You wanna play with the doggy?

Woof.

502
00:40:43.307 --> 00:40:44.442
Shut the fuck up.

503
00:40:44.442 --> 00:40:45.776
Shut up.

- I'm tired of this shit.

the kill switch.

547
00:42:55.773 --> 00:42:57.274
She threw the panel lights.

548
00:42:57.274 --> 00:42:59.777
Okay. but. but what
about our friends?

549
00:42:59.777 --> 00:43:00.945
Right?

550
00:43:00.945 --> 00:43:02.947
Oh. what about our friends?

551
00:43:02.947 --> 00:43:04.515
They're gone.

552
00:43:04.515 --> 00:43:05.349
Maybe you don't even
give a shit about them.

553
00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:07.217
but I still do.

554
00:43:07.217 --> 00:43:10.754
And we will drink to them
for they will be missed.

555
00:43:10.754 --> 00:43:12.623
Are you kidding me?

556
00:43:12.623 --> 00:43:16.226
Do I look like I am
kidding you right now?

557
00:43:16.226 --> 00:43:17.061
Hmm?

558
00:43:18.529 --> 00:43:20.731
You know. I'm starting
to miss working alone.

559
00:43:20.731 --> 00:43:22.266
Mm.

560
00:43:22.266 --> 00:43:24.101
You know. those
are the two people

561
00:43:24.101 --> 00:43:27.137
that we could actually
talk to about what we do.

562
00:43:27.137 --> 00:43:28.639
We should've had the day off.

563
00:43:28.639 --> 00:43:31.642
We should be enjoying
ourselves tonight.

564
00:43:31.642 --> 00:43:33.477
Okay?

565
00:43:33.477 --> 00:43:35.279
So instead we will give
them a motherfucking toast.

566
00:43:37.548 --> 00:43:38.415
Yeah?

567
00:43:38.415 --> 00:43:39.483
Yeah.

568
00:43:39.483 --> 00:43:40.317
Thank you.

569
00:43:43.153 --> 00:43:48.158
♪ You twirl your hair
and glance my way ♪

570
00:43:49.593 --> 00:43:50.995
♪ Blase ♪

571
00:43:50.995 --> 00:43:52.229
Mm.

572
00:43:52.229 --> 00:43:54.298
♪ We go playing that love game ♪

573
00:43:54.298 --> 00:43:57.034
Look here. how appropriate.

574
00:43:58.502 --> 00:44:01.105
I mean. it ain't work
if we're having fun.

575
00:44:01.105 --> 00:44:02.306
Right?

576
00:44:02.306 --> 00:44:03.140
Fun?

577
00:44:04.575 --> 00:44:06.276
I'm sure as shit not
having any fucking fun.

578
00:44:07.611 --> 00:44:09.780
Oh. speak for yourself.

579
00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:13.517
I mean. he is our friend and
he would do the same for us.

580
00:44:14.885 --> 00:44:17.121
Yeah. well I'm
supposed to be drunk.

581
00:44:17.121 --> 00:44:19.990
getting my groove on with one
of the bridesmaids right now.

582
00:44:21.592 --> 00:44:24.895
And whose fault is that?

583
00:44:27.598 --> 00:44:28.432
Hm?

584
00:44:38.142 --> 00:44:39.143
We trained together.

585
00:44:41.378 --> 00:44:42.880
Shared secrets.

586
00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:46.650
God. man. I love those guys.

587
00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:48.919
They're like my brothers.

588
00:44:51.922 --> 00:44:52.923
You know. love.

589
00:44:54.391 --> 00:44:56.226
You know. it's an
intense feeling

590
00:44:56.226 --> 00:45:01.231
of affection and concern
toward another human being.

591
00:45:02.332 --> 00:45:03.167
Me?

592
00:45:04.668 --> 00:45:06.203
I haven't been in love.

593
00:45:08.205 --> 00:45:09.506
No.

594
00:45:09.506 --> 00:45:10.941
Come on. man.

595
00:45:10.941 --> 00:45:12.776
Not this fucking
speech again. please.

596
00:45:12.776 --> 00:45:16.380
I am doing this to honor them.

597
00:45:19.416 --> 00:45:20.884
They would want to hear it.

598
00:45:21.952 --> 00:45:22.786
Okay?

599
00:45:24.221 --> 00:45:27.758
But seeing love happen.

600
00:45:30.127 --> 00:45:31.729
especially with one of
your closest friends.

601
00:45:31.729 --> 00:45:34.364
it is a beautiful thing.

602
00:45:35.332 --> 00:45:37.134
It really is.

603
00:45:37.134 --> 00:45:41.405
Now. when I was asked to
give the best man's speech.

604
00:45:41.405 --> 00:45:45.242
I can't say I was surprised.

605
00:45:45.242 --> 00:45:48.979
I mean. I killed a
lot of people to prove

606
00:45:48.979 --> 00:45:50.914
that I was the best.

607
00:45:50.914 --> 00:45:51.915
Right?

608
00:45:51.915 --> 00:45:53.250
I kid. I kid.

609
00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:54.618
I kid.

610
00:45:54.618 --> 00:45:56.286
Oh. wow.

611
00:45:58.088 --> 00:46:02.426
Seriously though. welcome
to our joyous occasion.

612
00:46:04.828 --> 00:46:05.829
In my name...

613
00:46:11.702 --> 00:46:12.536
Ooh.

614
00:46:13.971 --> 00:46:16.073
All right. we'll
finish this later.

615
00:46:16.073 --> 00:46:21.078
To those that have fallen and
those that are still standing.

616
00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:24.314
Hmm?

617
00:46:29.486 --> 00:46:30.654
Cheers.

618
00:46:35.492 --> 00:46:39.463
I mean. that is
one crazy story.

619
00:46:39.463 --> 00:46:42.032
And I can't believe y'all
are still together now.

620
00:46:43.834 --> 00:46:46.470
It sounds like you guys had
it even rougher than we did.

621
00:46:48.205 --> 00:46:50.107
Yeah. well. what can I say?

622
00:46:51.842 --> 00:46:54.578
A lot of people had to
die for us to be together.

623
00:46:55.646 --> 00:46:57.648
It sounds like it.

624
00:46:57.648 --> 00:46:59.049
Where'd you bury the bodies?

625
00:47:00.317 --> 00:47:01.151
Backyard?

626
00:47:04.888 --> 00:47:06.456
Yeah. well.
nobody really knows

627
00:47:06.456 --> 00:47:08.659
what goes on behind
closed doors. do they?

628
00:47:08.659 --> 00:47:12.196
No. they do not.

629
00:47:12.196 --> 00:47:13.697
- Stop it.
- No. but seriously

630
00:47:13.697 --> 00:47:16.767
he was crazy and
she deserved better.

631
00:47:16.767 --> 00:47:19.002
Don't know that she got
that. but here I am.

632
00:47:19.002 --> 00:47:20.003
Thank you. honey.

633
00:47:22.206 --> 00:47:23.340
So what about you two?

634
00:47:24.241 --> 00:47:25.909
How did you guys meet?

635
00:47:29.179 --> 00:47:31.215
Well. that's a long story.

636
00:47:32.149 --> 00:47:33.917
But I'll tell you what.

637
00:47:33.917 --> 00:47:37.087
there were a lot of people
didn't want us together neither.

638
00:47:38.222 --> 00:47:39.723
Yeah.

639
00:47:39.723 --> 00:47:40.924
That was a lot of
years ago now though.

640
00:47:40.924 --> 00:47:42.492
- Yeah.
- Right?

641
00:47:42.492 --> 00:47:44.094
20 years.

642
00:47:44.094 --> 00:47:45.095
Love conquers all.

643
00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:48.498
Now we just go wherever
our hearts lead us.

644
00:47:50.367 --> 00:47:52.236
Wow.

645
00:47:52.236 --> 00:47:55.038
Do you ever have any friends
or family come visit you?

646
00:47:55.038 --> 00:47:57.040
No. No.

647
00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:57.941
Unfortunately.

648
00:47:59.009 --> 00:48:01.745
But mostly. fortunately.

649
00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:04.748
We were gonna tell the museum.

650
00:48:11.722 --> 00:48:12.823
I gotta cook.

651
00:48:18.195 --> 00:48:21.431
Now that's definitely a
lifestyle I could get behind.

652
00:48:21.431 --> 00:48:23.066
What do you think?

653
00:48:43.754 --> 00:48:45.088
What about you guys?

654
00:48:45.088 --> 00:48:46.990
Anything you miss?

655
00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:49.426
Do you ever have
any regrets maybe?

656
00:48:49.426 --> 00:48:52.296
Just that we
never had children.

657
00:48:52.296 --> 00:48:53.964
Yeah.

658
00:48:53.964 --> 00:48:56.333
No way to go on once we're gone.

659
00:48:57.935 --> 00:48:59.970
Not to try and dig
too deep or anything

660
00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:02.539
but is that because you
didn't wanna have any.

661
00:49:02.539 --> 00:49:04.875
or you couldn't?

662
00:49:04.875 --> 00:49:06.643
Oh. we could.

663
00:49:06.643 --> 00:49:10.814
We want to but it just
didn't really make sense

664
00:49:10.814 --> 00:49:12.716
when we look at our way of life.

665
00:49:12.716 --> 00:49:14.451
What do you mean?

666
00:49:14.451 --> 00:49:15.619
I don't know.

667
00:49:15.619 --> 00:49:17.721
Just we both worked a lot.

668
00:49:17.721 --> 00:49:18.722
Both stressed.

669
00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:21.792
Both traveling for
work all the time.

670
00:49:21.792 --> 00:49:24.161
Both had a demanding job.

671
00:49:26.096 --> 00:49:27.331
Well it looks like
it all worked out

672
00:49:27.331 --> 00:49:28.966
for you guys in the end.

673
00:49:28.966 --> 00:49:30.334
We have a good life.

674
00:49:30.334 --> 00:49:32.436
Yeah. we do.

675
00:49:32.436 --> 00:49:34.171
We have our ups and
downs like everyone.

676
00:49:34.171 --> 00:49:35.372
but I wouldn't
trade for the world.

677
00:49:35.372 --> 00:49:37.607
Trust me. no. no. no.

678
00:49:37.607 --> 00:49:40.110
You know. I learned
a lot about life.

679
00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:41.945
Everything I did. you know?

680
00:49:41.945 --> 00:49:43.513
But that's what life is. right?

681
00:49:43.513 --> 00:49:45.349
It's about learning.

682
00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:48.785
Got respect. honor. endurance.

683
00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:53.190
Everything I did taught me
what I needed to know to live

684
00:49:54.124 --> 00:49:55.592
right up to this moment.

685
00:49:58.328 --> 00:50:00.931
And what about that
scar on your shoulder?

686
00:50:01.932 --> 00:50:03.133
What did that teach you?

687
00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:11.608
You don't
have to talk about it.

688
00:50:11.608 --> 00:50:12.976
if you don't want to.

689
00:50:12.976 --> 00:50:14.711
Oh. no. no. no. no.

690
00:50:16.613 --> 00:50:18.849
It's good knowing when
you're close to death.

691
00:50:20.217 --> 00:50:21.418
Makes you not
forget how to live.

692
00:50:24.988 --> 00:50:27.824
August 7th. 1986.

693
00:50:30.727 --> 00:50:32.996
That's the day that
changed my life forever.

694
00:50:32.996 --> 00:50:36.700
Eight of us. all sent on
foreign soil to take out

695
00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:39.403
some high ranking
official over there.

696
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:42.239
Fed a bunch of lies.

697
00:50:42.239 --> 00:50:44.708
That's often the way
to justify actions.

698
00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:47.677
You never question above.

699
00:50:48.578 --> 00:50:49.446
Not back then.

700
00:50:51.815 --> 00:50:54.518
He said it was supposed to
be a quick. easy in and out.

701
00:50:54.518 --> 00:50:55.685
And we believed him.

702
00:50:55.685 --> 00:50:57.220
You know?

703
00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:58.255
But the thing was...

704
00:51:00.757 --> 00:51:04.394
The eight of us. we were
among the best at what we did.

705
00:51:04.394 --> 00:51:07.397
But we never worked together.

706
00:51:09.099 --> 00:51:10.233
I mean. not as a team.

707
00:51:11.902 --> 00:51:14.037
I mean. we'd hung out together.

708
00:51:14.037 --> 00:51:15.472
We drank beers together.

709
00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.542
We trained together.
respected each other.

710
00:51:20.944 --> 00:51:23.080
We was all the best of
friends. is what we were.

711
00:51:24.881 --> 00:51:27.751
I mean we always. we
always worked alone.

712
00:51:29.786 --> 00:51:31.855
That's how it was preferred.

713
00:51:31.855 --> 00:51:33.023
Always.

714
00:51:33.023 --> 00:51:34.558
That's how we preferred it.

715
00:51:34.558 --> 00:51:37.094
You know. we were
all good enough

716
00:51:37.094 --> 00:51:40.230
that we could do whatever
we needed to do alone.

717
00:51:41.698 --> 00:51:43.934
One man. that person.
he can slip in and out.

718
00:51:43.934 --> 00:51:45.969
but you bring a group. all of
a sudden that's gonna bring

719
00:51:45.969 --> 00:51:47.504
a lot of attention.

720
00:51:47.504 --> 00:51:49.306
And that's exactly what
happened on that day.

721
00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:52.776
August 7th. 1986.

722
00:51:55.312 --> 00:51:57.080
See. instead of
being on offense.

723
00:51:58.148 --> 00:52:00.750
we found ourselves on defense.

724
00:52:03.286 --> 00:52:05.755
Might as well have been the
4th of July in that room.

725
00:52:05.755 --> 00:52:06.790
We were...

726
00:52:07.657 --> 00:52:08.492
Bang.

727
00:52:10.927 --> 00:52:12.596
Bows flying all over the place.

728
00:52:15.165 --> 00:52:17.501
Ringing.

729
00:52:17.501 --> 00:52:20.637
That's the kind of ringing
don't leave your head either.

730
00:52:20.637 --> 00:52:21.805
It's the kind of
ringing that wake you up

731
00:52:21.805 --> 00:52:25.842
in the middle of night today.

732
00:52:29.146 --> 00:52:30.514
Yeah. they was my brothers.

733
00:52:32.649 --> 00:52:35.318
There's no way to erase the
sight of watching your brother

734
00:52:35.318 --> 00:52:36.820
take his last breath.

735
00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:39.789
And my night. that was me.

736
00:52:41.291 --> 00:52:42.292
Seven times.

737
00:52:44.094 --> 00:52:46.129
See. I was the only
one to make it back.

738
00:52:52.202 --> 00:52:53.136
Oh. shotgun.

739
00:52:54.404 --> 00:52:55.238
Shoulder.

740
00:52:56.339 --> 00:52:57.541
But I survived it.

741
00:52:59.509 --> 00:53:02.412
August 7th. 1986.

742
00:53:06.516 --> 00:53:07.784
What a goddamn day.

743
00:53:12.355 --> 00:53:13.190
I'm sorry.

744
00:53:14.658 --> 00:53:16.393
Sometimes you
lose your closest.

745
00:53:17.861 --> 00:53:19.829
'cause that's what
happens at war.

746
00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:20.664
Right?

747
00:53:21.731 --> 00:53:22.866
But you know the funny thing?

748
00:53:24.668 --> 00:53:28.405
Back then. usually the
day before you went off

749
00:53:28.405 --> 00:53:30.373
on the day before. you went
and you had a bachelor party.

750
00:53:30.373 --> 00:53:31.208
Right?

751
00:53:32.976 --> 00:53:36.980
I didn't have anyone left to
throw mine on August 8th. 1986.

752
00:53:43.053 --> 00:53:48.058
But that did not
stop me from marrying

753
00:53:49.859 --> 00:53:53.563
the most beautiful woman in
the world on August 9th. 1986.

754
00:53:53.563 --> 00:53:55.532
The happiest day of my life.

755
00:54:01.871 --> 00:54:03.640
This is it.

756
00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:07.477
Everything I've done has taught
me what I needed to learn

757
00:54:08.945 --> 00:54:12.582
to live right here
in this moment.

758
00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:15.752
Now. enough of all
this dark stuff.

759
00:54:15.752 --> 00:54:17.287
Right?

760
00:54:17.287 --> 00:54:19.089
This is a honeymoon. I thought.

761
00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:22.759
We are in paradise. take a look.

762
00:54:22.759 --> 00:54:25.629
Look at water and
we got islands.

763
00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:28.298
You two go and have some fun.

764
00:54:28.298 --> 00:54:29.466
All right?

765
00:54:29.466 --> 00:54:31.234
Take advantage of this ride.

766
00:54:31.234 --> 00:54:33.336
Well that sounds like
a great idea to me.

767
00:54:48.084 --> 00:54:49.819

00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:09.399
Easy. there. tiger.

785
00:56:09.399 --> 00:56:12.202
Okay. maybe she's
just fucking with us.

786
00:56:12.202 --> 00:56:13.737
Right?

787
00:56:13.737 --> 00:56:16.573
And maybe she's still
upstairs right now.

788
00:56:16.573 --> 00:56:18.141
Hmm?

789
00:56:18.141 --> 00:56:19.175
I mean. regardless.
we will find out.

790
00:56:20.076 --> 00:56:22.145
I love our dear groom.

791
00:56:22.145 --> 00:56:23.313
I really do.

792
00:56:23.313 --> 00:56:24.848
I do.

793
00:56:24.848 --> 00:56:26.383
I'm the best man.
of course I do.

794
00:56:26.383 --> 00:56:30.420
But this wedding is
officially called off.

795
00:56:32.222 --> 00:56:33.690
So are you saying we're
cool with a killer now?

796
00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:35.058
Well we're not
gonna sit around here

797
00:56:35.058 --> 00:56:37.093
and let her kill us.

798
00:56:37.093 --> 00:56:37.927
Are we?

799
00:56:39.629 --> 00:56:41.765
Yeah. I'm not down
for her killing us.

800
00:56:41.765 --> 00:56:43.466
That's for damn sure.

801
00:56:43.466 --> 00:56:45.535
Yo. he's gonna
be pissed though.

802
00:56:45.535 --> 00:56:46.770
Oh. God.

803
00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:50.273
It's for his own good. and ours.

804
00:56:50.273 --> 00:56:53.009
Since you're the best
man. you can tell him

805
00:56:53.009 --> 00:56:54.811
we killed his bride.

806
00:56:54.811 --> 00:56:56.179
I am the best man.

807
00:56:57.046 --> 00:56:57.881
And I will.

808
00:56:59.215 --> 00:57:01.117
You know what?

809
00:57:01.117 --> 00:57:04.087
Let's make this a little
more fun. shall we?

810
00:57:04.087 --> 00:57:05.622
Huh?

811
00:57:05.622 --> 00:57:07.824
Okay. we're gonna
call this mission...

812
00:57:07.824 --> 00:57:09.292
I got it. I got it.

813
00:57:09.292 --> 00:57:11.795
Showdown at the family cabin.

814
00:57:13.229 --> 00:57:15.432
Whoever gets to her
first wins the honeymoon

815
00:57:15.432 --> 00:57:17.934
that I purchased for
the happy couple.

816
00:57:17.934 --> 00:57:21.604
Yeah. but you probably pick
some bougie shit like Paris.

817
00:57:21.604 --> 00:57:23.573
So cliche.

818
00:57:24.474 --> 00:57:26.209
Puerto Rico. my friend.

819
00:57:27.644 --> 00:57:29.446
I
love Puerto Rico.

820
00:57:29.446 --> 00:57:32.115
I bet you do.

821
00:57:32.115 --> 00:57:32.949
So...

822
00:57:35.251 --> 00:57:39.088
You. why don't you
take the upstairs.

823
00:57:39.088 --> 00:57:40.824
In case it was a diversion.

824
00:57:40.824 --> 00:57:44.394
You can fuck off to the
basement. in case she's hiding.

825
00:57:44.394 --> 00:57:46.763
And we shall take the front.

826
00:57:46.763 --> 00:57:48.965
make sure she doesn't
get one of those cars.

827
00:57:48.965 --> 00:57:50.333
Right?

828
00:57:50.333 --> 00:57:51.835
- Right.
- Come on.

829
00:58:09.419 --> 00:58:10.353
Okay. which way to go.

830
00:58:10.353 --> 00:58:11.421
Which way to go.

831
00:58:12.789 --> 00:58:14.657
Actually. you take.
you take left.

832
00:58:14.657 --> 00:58:15.792
Yeah. you.

833
00:58:15.792 --> 00:58:16.626
Yeah. all right.

834
00:58:16.626 --> 00:58:18.094
Nah.

835
00:58:18.094 --> 00:58:20.029
Nah. you take
right. I lean left.

836
00:58:20.029 --> 00:58:20.864
Okay?

837
00:58:21.698 --> 00:58:22.832
Right?

838
00:58:22.832 --> 00:58:24.567
Focus. motherfucker.

839
00:58:24.567 --> 00:58:25.702
Focus. Focus.

840
00:58:25.702 --> 00:58:26.970
Mm. they're watching.

841
00:58:35.445 --> 00:58:36.346
Sweetheart?

842
00:58:37.847 --> 00:58:39.015
Where are you?

843
00:58:40.650 --> 00:58:43.820
I'm missing my dancing partner.

844
00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:44.654
Come on.

845
00:58:49.659 --> 00:58:52.195
Yeah. sure.

846
00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:58.401
Got me out here looking for
her crazy ass by myself.

847
00:58:59.736 --> 00:59:01.371
Everybody else in pairs.

848
00:59:04.874 --> 00:59:06.676

This is some bullshit.

851
00:59:14.217 --> 00:59:17.854
Where. where. where
is that beautiful bride?

852
00:59:19.022 --> 00:59:19.856
Huh?

you're out here.

856
00:59:35.638 --> 00:59:39.542

01:13:15.424 --> 01:13:16.525
my boy's fucking heart.

1087
01:13:16.525 --> 01:13:18.360
You know that. right?

1088
01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:19.928
You know that.

1089
01:13:19.928 --> 01:13:20.929
Well maybe I should
have never even tried

1090
01:13:20.929 --> 01:13:22.197
to go through with it.

1091
01:13:23.999 --> 01:13:27.803
But by the time I realized
it was already too late.

1092
01:13:29.171 --> 01:13:31.373
the train was already
on the tracks.

1093
01:13:37.579 --> 01:13:40.182
Come here.

1094
01:13:40.182 --> 01:13:41.250
Okay.

1095
01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:43.419
You're a killer.

1096
01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:44.486
I'm a killer.

1097
01:13:45.621 --> 01:13:47.289
And I will kill you.

1098
01:13:49.124 --> 01:13:52.227
I've already killed most of
our fucking friends tonight.

1099
01:13:52.227 --> 01:13:54.897
Yeah. I see that and
I really appreciate it.

1100
01:13:54.897 --> 01:13:55.731
Yeah.

1101
01:13:57.232 --> 01:13:58.066
Call him.

1102
01:13:59.501 --> 01:14:01.136
What?

1103
01:14:01.136 --> 01:14:02.638
The one we both
still have left.

1104
01:14:02.638 --> 01:14:04.206
Oh God.

1105
01:14:04.206 --> 01:14:06.508
Yeah. I want you. I
want you to pull out

1106
01:14:06.508 --> 01:14:09.645
your phone slowly and
I want you to call him

1107
01:14:09.645 --> 01:14:12.114
and I want you to
tell him that I'm dead

1108
01:14:13.582 --> 01:14:15.984
and that he doesn't have
to come here anymore.

1109
01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.321
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

1110
01:14:19.321 --> 01:14:20.322
What?

1111
01:14:20.322 --> 01:14:22.925
You want me to call him

1112
01:14:22.925 --> 01:14:26.929
and tell him his best man
killed his bride to be?

1113
01:14:26.929 --> 01:14:28.831
Come on. he would be so
fucking pissed at me.

1114
01:14:28.831 --> 01:14:29.832
I can't do it.

1115
01:14:29.832 --> 01:14:31.967
No fucking way.

1116
01:14:31.967 --> 01:14:33.168
Oh.

1117
01:14:33.168 --> 01:14:35.103
Sh.

1118
01:14:35.103 --> 01:14:37.506
Are you more worried about
pissing him off right now?

1119
01:14:38.841 --> 01:14:40.976
Or pissing me off more?

1120
01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:44.413
You. darling. of course.

1121
01:14:44.413 --> 01:14:45.414
Definitely.

1122
01:14:45.414 --> 01:14:47.015
Then fucking call him.

1123
01:14:47.015 --> 01:14:49.718
All right. all
right. all right.

1124
01:14:49.718 --> 01:14:51.487
All right. All right.

1125
01:15:02.364 --> 01:15:04.166
What's going on?

1126
01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:06.368
I just got back from the Dean's.
everything's cool for now.

1127
01:15:06.368 --> 01:15:07.336
I'm just about to head that way.

1128
01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:08.170
Where is she?

1129
01:15:09.104 --> 01:15:11.006
Ah. she's dead.

1130
01:15:15.477 --> 01:15:16.912
Do you hear what I said?

1131
01:15:16.912 --> 01:15:19.348
I said that she is dead.

1132
01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:20.983
You killed her?

1133
01:15:20.983 --> 01:15:23.552
I mean. I didn't
really have a choice.

1134
01:15:23.552 --> 01:15:24.820
I mean. you know how she is.

1135
01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:27.523
And she took out
every other guy.

1136
01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:28.524
So-

1137
01:15:28.524 --> 01:15:30.058
All of them?

1138
01:15:30.058 --> 01:15:31.560
Well. I mean. shit
man. I just. you know.

1139
01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:33.829
I had to kill her
before she killed me.

1140
01:15:33.829 --> 01:15:37.299
But listen. listen. if
it's any consolation

1141
01:15:37.299 --> 01:15:41.470
she was one tough bitch.

1142
01:15:42.304 --> 01:15:43.472
You know?

1143
01:15:43.472 --> 01:15:44.406
But I am sorry about everything.

1144
01:16:07.329 --> 01:16:08.163
He hung up.

1145
01:16:08.163 --> 01:16:09.631
So...

1146
01:16:09.631 --> 01:16:11.533
But listen. I. you know.
while we're waiting

1147
01:16:11.533 --> 01:16:14.570
for him I should give you
the speech that I prepared.

1148
01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:16.705
I worked my ass off on it.

1149
01:16:17.906 --> 01:16:19.808
You know the definition of love-

1150
01:16:34.957 --> 01:16:35.924
Hey. bitch.

1151
01:16:39.761 --> 01:16:41.430
I ain't finished with you yet.

1152
01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:45.367
God. not you again.

1153
01:16:45.367 --> 01:16:47.569
Oh. looks like
everyone is dead.

1154
01:16:48.637 --> 01:16:50.839
Good. they were weak.

1155
01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:53.976
I was supposed to be best man.

1156
01:16:53.976 --> 01:16:55.210
Huh?

1157
01:16:55.210 --> 01:16:56.445
You caught me slipping.

1158
01:16:57.846 --> 01:16:59.481
It ain't happening again.

1159
01:16:59.481 --> 01:17:00.816
How was your flight?

1160
01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:02.784
It was rough.

1161
01:17:03.685 --> 01:17:05.687
But I'm here. ain't I?

1162
01:17:05.687 --> 01:17:07.556
I guess you came
back for more.

1163
01:17:07.556 --> 01:17:09.157
You ready for round two?

1164
01:17:09.157 --> 01:17:10.692
Are you ready?

1165
01:17:10.692 --> 01:17:12.861
I'm gonna rip your
fucking head off.

1166
01:17:12.861 --> 01:17:14.496
And you're gonna regret this.

1167
01:17:14.496 --> 01:17:15.330
Whoa.

1168
01:17:17.866 --> 01:17:18.700
Whoa.

1169
01:17:20.335 --> 01:17:21.837
Wow.

1170
01:17:21.837 --> 01:17:24.640
I'm gonna beat you like
your daddy used to.

1171
01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:25.974
Come on.

1172
01:17:25.974 --> 01:17:27.576
Come on. bitch.

1173
01:17:27.576 --> 01:17:28.944
What did you just call me?

1174
01:17:30.012 --> 01:17:31.880
What did it sound like?

1175
01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:33.181
A female dog?

1176
01:17:33.181 --> 01:17:34.816
Come on. bitch.

1177
01:17:34.816 --> 01:17:38.353
Don't you ever call
me a bitch again.

1178
01:17:39.454 --> 01:17:41.056
Fuck you.

1179
01:17:41.056 --> 01:17:42.190
Come on. bitch.

1180
01:18:00.375 --> 01:18:01.677
What the fuck?

1181
01:18:02.744 --> 01:18:04.680
What the actual fuck?

1182
01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:09.618
You better let me go
right now you fucking...

1183
01:18:10.986 --> 01:18:11.987
I'm sorry.

1184
01:18:14.056 --> 01:18:15.290
I'm sorry.

1185
01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:16.925
This is actually really good.

1186
01:18:16.925 --> 01:18:18.927
This is good.

1187
01:18:18.927 --> 01:18:19.928
We're in a good place right now.

1188
01:18:19.928 --> 01:18:21.096
You know.

1189
01:18:21.096 --> 01:18:23.098
Me and you we're a lot alike.

1190
01:18:23.098 --> 01:18:24.633
We are.

1191
01:18:24.633 --> 01:18:27.069
All the fighting and killing.

1192
01:18:27.069 --> 01:18:28.770
It's exhausting.

1193
01:18:28.770 --> 01:18:29.705
I'm over it.

1194
01:18:29.705 --> 01:18:31.173
I'm done.

1195
01:18:31.173 --> 01:18:32.841
You want out?

1196
01:18:32.841 --> 01:18:33.775
So do I.

1197
01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:36.078
So do I.

1198
01:18:36.078 --> 01:18:37.012
Yo. this is perfect.

1199
01:18:37.012 --> 01:18:38.046
We could...

1200
01:18:38.046 --> 01:18:38.947
We could just...

1201
01:18:39.881 --> 01:18:41.183
We could just leave.

1202
01:18:41.183 --> 01:18:42.350
Yeah?

1203
01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:43.485
We could just leave.

1204
01:18:44.853 --> 01:18:46.755
You and I. we could
just run away.

1205
01:18:46.755 --> 01:18:48.356
I mean. not together.

1206
01:18:49.691 --> 01:18:51.660
Unless. unless
that's what you want.

1207
01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:54.596
I always. I always thought that
you were. you were special.

1208
01:18:56.064 --> 01:18:57.232
I...

1209
01:18:57.232 --> 01:18:58.333
I always had a crush on you.

1210
01:19:01.403 --> 01:19:02.738
No. no.

1211
01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:04.539
No.

1212
01:19:04.539 --> 01:19:05.407
Okay. you could. you
could just go by yourself.

1213
01:19:06.775 --> 01:19:09.144
You could just fucking
leave yourself.

1214
01:19:09.144 --> 01:19:10.712
Get me the fuck outta here.

1215
01:19:10.712 --> 01:19:12.547
Cut me loose and we
can go toe to toe

1216
01:19:12.547 --> 01:19:14.549
you fucking bitch.

1217
01:19:14.549 --> 01:19:16.885
Let me fucking go.

1218
01:19:16.885 --> 01:19:19.121
Oh God. I will destroy you.

1219
01:19:19.955 --> 01:19:21.590
God damn it.

1220
01:19:22.691 --> 01:19:24.993
Fuck. I'll destroy you. bitch.

1221
01:19:24.993 --> 01:19:26.895
Yeah.

1222
01:19:26.895 --> 01:19:28.430
Everyone says that you're
supposed to be the best.

1223
01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:29.765
Ah. the sweet little girl.

1224
01:19:29.765 --> 01:19:30.832
The best.

1225
01:19:30.832 --> 01:19:32.000
It's fucking bullshit.

1226
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.568
You're a fucking joke.

1227
01:19:33.568 --> 01:19:35.070
Look at you. you're
fucking pathetic.

1228
01:19:35.070 --> 01:19:36.805
You fucking bitch.

1229
01:19:39.374 --> 01:19:42.778
That thing doesn't even
fucking work you stupid cunt.

1230
01:19:46.081 --> 01:19:47.282
Nice legs though.

1231
01:19:47.282 --> 01:19:49.184
Really. nice legs.

1232
01:19:49.184 --> 01:19:50.852
Yeah.

1233
01:19:52.721 --> 01:19:55.323
When you tried to kill me
earlier you forgot the gas.

1234
01:20:01.196 --> 01:20:02.030
Fuck.

1235
01:20:03.431 --> 01:20:04.432
Fuck.

1236
01:21:34.522 --> 01:21:35.857
You didn't read up
on the assignment

1237
01:21:35.857 --> 01:21:37.859
very well then. did you?

1238
01:21:39.261 --> 01:21:42.430
Wow. I didn't even
know people ate shark.

1239
01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:43.865
But it was great.

1240
01:21:44.766 --> 01:21:46.134
Well. you can do it.

1241
01:21:46.134 --> 01:21:48.103
A lot of variables.

1242
01:21:48.103 --> 01:21:50.939
You got species
of the shark. age.

1243
01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:53.675
how fast you could bleed it out.

1244
01:21:55.377 --> 01:21:56.878
Yeah. well we never
fished shark back in London.

1245
01:21:56.878 --> 01:21:57.712
That's for sure.

1246
01:21:59.781 --> 01:22:02.217
Because people are
scared of sharks.

1247
01:22:02.217 --> 01:22:03.518
Fierce. fierce predators.

1248
01:22:05.587 --> 01:22:08.857
Let me ask you. you
both afraid of sharks?

1249
01:22:10.625 --> 01:22:15.597
You see I equate the situation
we have here right now

1250
01:22:17.399 --> 01:22:20.702
to the relationship with
the shark and the dolphin.

1251
01:22:20.702 --> 01:22:24.339
You see the shark and the
dolphin tend to inhabit

1252
01:22:24.339 --> 01:22:25.307
the same region.

1253
01:22:26.975 --> 01:22:29.311
They can be copacetic.
live together. be happy.

1254
01:22:31.112 --> 01:22:34.416
But all it takes is
for one bad shark

1255
01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:37.619
and that turns the tide.

1256
01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:41.489
And then it ruins
it for everybody.

1257
01:22:42.958 --> 01:22:46.761
See a dolphin. you got
a lot to offer the shark

1258
01:22:46.761 --> 01:22:48.596
in the way of the food chain.

1259
01:22:48.596 --> 01:22:49.831
Big food source.

1260
01:22:50.932 --> 01:22:52.968
Now the shark on the other hand.

1261
01:22:52.968 --> 01:22:56.838
he got absolutely nothing
to offer that dolphin.

1262
01:22:58.473 --> 01:22:59.841
Everybody knows a shark.

1263
01:23:01.343 --> 01:23:03.111
he could rip right
into that dolphin.

1264
01:23:03.111 --> 01:23:04.646
Can't he?

1265
01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:07.382
But the dolphin. he
don't have that luxury.

1266
01:23:09.050 --> 01:23:13.288
No. the dolphin. he
gotta stay with the pack

1267
01:23:13.288 --> 01:23:17.659
and swim around that shark
and try to confuse him.

1268
01:23:19.327 --> 01:23:22.163
Now when he least expect
it. without any warning.

1269
01:23:22.163 --> 01:23:27.068
that dolphin. he surprises
him by swimming up underneath

1270
01:23:28.837 --> 01:23:31.373
and he ram that nose right
into that shark belly

1271
01:23:33.708 --> 01:23:37.212
and kill the shark
with one good blow.

1272
01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:39.614
That's a fact.

1273
01:23:41.182 --> 01:23:42.017
So...

1274
01:23:45.787 --> 01:23:48.189
I bring this up incidentally.

1275
01:23:51.159 --> 01:23:54.195
because this is
where I find myself

1276
01:23:54.195 --> 01:23:57.899
and my wife this current moment.

1277
01:23:59.401 --> 01:24:01.369
And we need to know.
we'd like to know.

1278
01:24:04.506 --> 01:24:05.673
are we the shark?

1279
01:24:08.643 --> 01:24:09.811
Are we the dolphin?

1280
01:24:25.994 --> 01:24:30.999
See the dolphin. he's got
no reason to kill the shark.

1281
01:24:35.603 --> 01:24:36.771
Unless it's defense.

1282
01:24:38.573 --> 01:24:42.143
And that is the position I do
believe that I find my wife

1283
01:24:42.143 --> 01:24:44.479
and myself currently
in right now.

1284
01:24:46.481 --> 01:24:49.751
Now dolphins have been
known to play with sharks.

1285
01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:54.022
Much like a cat would play
with mice before they kill it.

1286
01:24:55.123 --> 01:24:57.926
But that's just a weird game.

1287
01:24:59.761 --> 01:25:02.163
We've known who you two
were ever since we met you

1288
01:25:02.163 --> 01:25:04.099
at the bar yesterday.

1289
01:25:04.099 --> 01:25:06.034
Doing what you're doing.

1290
01:25:06.034 --> 01:25:09.037
We were both you. only we
were doing it long before

1291
01:25:09.037 --> 01:25:10.872
you two were ever born.

1292
01:25:10.872 --> 01:25:14.609
Now the university knows
that we know the rules

1293
01:25:16.311 --> 01:25:18.279
and that's one of the reasons
we've been able to avoid

1294
01:25:18.279 --> 01:25:20.782
their cross hairs
for over 20 years.

1295
01:25:23.651 --> 01:25:26.721
And they'd know that
one of these rules

1296
01:25:26.721 --> 01:25:28.256
say you'd never send a teacher

1297
01:25:28.256 --> 01:25:29.757
because teachers.
they work alone.

1298
01:25:31.259 --> 01:25:33.128
But I think they did
that intentionally.

1299
01:25:33.128 --> 01:25:34.796
that was the reason. because
they thought if they sent

1300
01:25:34.796 --> 01:25:37.765
you both you may
get close enough

1301
01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:41.436
and that you can clean
their palate of us.

1302
01:25:42.504 --> 01:25:43.338
Forever.

1303
01:25:46.307 --> 01:25:48.143
Now there also may
be one other reason

1304
01:25:48.143 --> 01:25:50.378
they sent you both. I think.

1305
01:25:50.378 --> 01:25:55.150
Because they knew that one
of you would do anything.

1306
01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:57.285
and I mean anything to
get close enough to us

1307
01:25:57.285 --> 01:25:58.820
to put a bullet in our heads.

1308
01:26:04.025 --> 01:26:06.161
Did you know there's only
one time since we fled

1309
01:26:06.161 --> 01:26:08.129
the university that
we have any problems

1310
01:26:08.129 --> 01:26:10.965
in this long. long.
strange trip we've had?

1311
01:26:10.965 --> 01:26:13.668
April 26th. 1994.

1312
01:26:13.668 --> 01:26:15.170
I'm good with dates. aren't I?

1313
01:26:17.839 --> 01:26:20.208
I think you know that
date. don't you. darling?

1314
01:26:22.977 --> 01:26:24.646
They found us in Europe.

1315
01:26:27.015 --> 01:26:28.483
Man. you have his eyes.

1316
01:26:30.818 --> 01:26:32.487
And that smile
when it comes out.

1317
01:26:36.191 --> 01:26:40.028
And if he was my
daddy. I understand.

1318
01:26:40.028 --> 01:26:41.729
because I would
want that revenge.

1319
01:26:43.965 --> 01:26:48.970
But I love my wife. so I cannot
give you the satisfaction

1320
01:26:51.005 --> 01:26:52.674
that you desire.

1321
01:26:52.674 --> 01:26:54.742
I never even got to
say goodbye to him.

1322
01:26:56.711 --> 01:26:58.379
He was a good man.

1323
01:26:58.379 --> 01:26:59.447
He truly was.

1324
01:27:00.848 --> 01:27:02.016
But he came to kill us.

1325
01:27:04.085 --> 01:27:05.687
And this is the life we chose.

1326
01:27:31.746 --> 01:27:34.415
I guess you've been out of
the game for too long now.

1327
01:27:36.317 --> 01:27:38.086
You've gone soft
in your old age.

1328
01:27:39.587 --> 01:27:40.755
You've lost your edge.

1329
01:27:42.490 --> 01:27:44.626
Missed things that would've
got you killed years ago

1330
01:27:44.626 --> 01:27:46.394
if you had then.

1331
01:27:46.394 --> 01:27:49.931
Like my bride here emptying
out all the bullets

1332
01:27:49.931 --> 01:27:51.766
from your only gun on board.

1333
01:27:52.734 --> 01:27:53.901
I pity you. really.

1334
01:27:55.503 --> 01:27:57.305
It amazes me that you've
been able to evade

1335
01:27:57.305 --> 01:27:59.073
the university as
long as you have.

1336
01:28:00.508 --> 01:28:02.243
I mean. hell. you're
practically the reason

1337
01:28:02.243 --> 01:28:04.479
for the no romantic
relationships on campus policy

1338
01:28:04.479 --> 01:28:08.049
and yet here you sit helpless.

1339
01:28:09.984 --> 01:28:12.687
The ones who got away.

1340
01:28:12.687 --> 01:28:15.056
The runaways who
could never be found.

1341
01:28:15.056 --> 01:28:17.091
You were once two of the best

1342
01:28:17.091 --> 01:28:20.094
and now it seems as
though you've forgotten

1343
01:28:20.094 --> 01:28:21.329
who you once were.

1344
01:28:22.764 --> 01:28:26.467
No. you don't forget.

1345
01:28:27.935 --> 01:28:29.937
You don't forget
what we've done.

1346
01:28:32.907 --> 01:28:36.778
Growing old does
not make you soft.

1347
01:28:38.913 --> 01:28:41.149
I assure you I
haven't lost my edge.

1348
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:46.721
It's just that I got
tired of sharpening it.

1349
01:28:48.489 --> 01:28:52.460
The fact that it is so dull
has put you in a position

1350
01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:54.962
where not only can
you not protect her.

1351
01:28:54.962 --> 01:28:56.864
but you can't protect yourself.

1352
01:28:57.865 --> 01:28:58.933
We had a good life.

1353
01:29:02.003 --> 01:29:02.837
More than most.

1354
01:29:04.505 --> 01:29:08.843
And now we take the adventure
we never had together.

1355
01:30:43.204 --> 01:30:45.039
I've always loved
the way you smell.

1356
01:30:51.145 --> 01:30:52.280
You killed all of them?

1357
01:30:54.816 --> 01:30:57.051
Are you
surprised. honey?

1358
01:30:57.051 --> 01:30:57.852
No.

1359
01:30:59.754 --> 01:31:00.588
Not really.

1360
01:31:04.258 --> 01:31:05.927
They were our friends though.

1361
01:31:10.131 --> 01:31:11.799
They
were your friends.

1362
01:31:16.971 --> 01:31:18.473
I spoke to the Dean tonight.

1363
01:31:19.941 --> 01:31:21.642
I convinced him you
weren't a flight risk

1364
01:31:21.642 --> 01:31:24.879
and that you'd just
gotten cold feet.

1365
01:31:27.181 --> 01:31:28.082
Oh. dear.

1366
01:31:29.517 --> 01:31:31.352
It's gonna be kind
of hard to prove

1367
01:31:31.352 --> 01:31:33.187
that now that you've killed
half our wedding party.

1368
01:31:33.187 --> 01:31:35.656
I don't need to prove
anything to anybody anymore.

1369
01:31:37.558 --> 01:31:40.661
Like I said. I want out.

1370
01:31:41.729 --> 01:31:43.030
Well there's no way out.

1371
01:31:44.532 --> 01:31:47.201
I think that old couple
has proven that enough.

1372
01:31:49.704 --> 01:31:53.708
They'll find you no
matter how long it takes.

1373
01:31:53.708 --> 01:31:56.210
That old couple still
had plenty of time together

1374
01:31:56.210 --> 01:31:57.144
away from them.

1375
01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:01.382
They had a good life.

1376
01:32:01.382 --> 01:32:03.050
What?

1377
01:32:03.050 --> 01:32:04.852
Out on a boat
practically by themselves

1378
01:32:04.852 --> 01:32:09.724
for 20 something years
doing absolutely jack shit?

1379
01:32:09.724 --> 01:32:13.027
That's not a life.
that's merely existence.

1380
01:32:13.027 --> 01:32:15.496
We should have
never killed that couple.

1381
01:32:15.496 --> 01:32:20.301
We did them a favor and
put them out of their misery.

1382
01:32:21.769 --> 01:32:23.838
The old man killed your
father for Christ sake.

1383
01:32:23.838 --> 01:32:26.073
Because my father
was one of them.

1384
01:32:26.073 --> 01:32:27.141
One of us.

1385
01:32:28.576 --> 01:32:30.411
He did what he had to
do for him and his wife

1386
01:32:30.411 --> 01:32:31.913
to be together.

1387
01:32:31.913 --> 01:32:35.550
Now the university
gave us their blessing.

1388
01:32:39.353 --> 01:32:42.323
They didn't know so I didn't
think they would but they did.

1389
01:32:48.896 --> 01:32:51.799
We could have a
good life together.

1390
01:32:53.334 --> 01:32:55.369
The only reason they
gave us their blessing

1391
01:32:55.369 --> 01:32:57.438
is because of what we
did to that couple.

1392
01:32:59.774 --> 01:33:02.209
As long as we were still playing
by the rest of their rules

1393
01:33:02.209 --> 01:33:04.445
we were worth more
alive to them than dead.

1394
01:33:04.445 --> 01:33:08.616
Sure we came clean and
told them about us.

1395
01:33:08.616 --> 01:33:09.917
so they trusted us.

1396
01:33:11.385 --> 01:33:12.920
but really it was
just another way

1397
01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:13.955
for them to still
try and control us.

1398
01:33:15.756 --> 01:33:17.792
That's why they allowed
us to go through with it.

1399
01:33:17.792 --> 01:33:19.527
But they allowed it.

1400
01:33:20.728 --> 01:33:21.896
The university.

1401
01:33:23.798 --> 01:33:26.133
To some they cut checks.

1402
01:33:26.133 --> 01:33:29.837
to you they're like
a goddamn religion.

1403
01:33:30.972 --> 01:33:32.773
Don't you get it?

1404
01:33:32.773 --> 01:33:34.775
We shouldn't have had
to ask permission.

1405
01:33:34.775 --> 01:33:38.813
Yeah. well. we all knew
the rules when we enrolled.

1406
01:33:40.114 --> 01:33:41.015
All of us did.

1407
01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:46.621
Well. like I
said. people change.

1408
01:33:49.557 --> 01:33:50.591
Well what about us?

1409
01:33:51.592 --> 01:33:52.927
Hmm?

1410
01:33:52.927 --> 01:33:54.028
Did that change too?

1411
01:33:58.566 --> 01:34:00.334
You look like you
could use a drink.

1412
01:34:02.637 --> 01:34:04.271
Come on.

1413
01:34:04.271 --> 01:34:06.007
Don't treat me like a stranger.

1414
01:34:06.007 --> 01:34:08.342
After all you are the
one who left me standing

1415
01:34:08.342 --> 01:34:09.410
at the altar tonight.

1416
01:34:10.244 --> 01:34:11.045
Remember?

1417
01:34:15.783 --> 01:34:19.987
Sure. I could
always use a drink.

1418
01:35:02.363 --> 01:35:04.365
May I have this dance?

1419
01:35:05.833 --> 01:35:06.901
Last dance.

1420
01:35:14.875 --> 01:35:19.847
♪ Ooh. ah. do you remember ♪

1421
01:35:20.948 --> 01:35:25.886

♪ Doo. ah. you said you

1430
01:36:26.814 --> 01:36:28.282
Why'd you do it?

1431
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:31.485
Why did you leave
them all there?

1432
01:36:31.485 --> 01:36:33.988
All alone with no explanation.

1433
01:36:35.956 --> 01:36:39.827
If I could run from
you easily. I would've
done it sooner.

1434
01:36:39.827 --> 01:36:41.996
But you're my partner.

1435
01:36:41.996 --> 01:36:45.566
And a partner's not supposed
to run from their partner.

1436
01:36:45.566 --> 01:36:48.636
I guess I'm
not a good person.

1437
01:36:48.636 --> 01:36:50.471
Most of the people
that you've killed

1438
01:36:52.206 --> 01:36:54.175
weren't very good for
themselves or anyone else.

1439
01:36:55.943 --> 01:36:59.480
See even God doesn't
judge. so why should we?

1440
01:37:03.150 --> 01:37:05.452
I was sitting
in church tonight.

1441
01:37:06.754 --> 01:37:09.623
alone in my
beautiful white dress

1442
01:37:11.358 --> 01:37:15.462
and I saw this mother with
her baby and a little baby boy

1443
01:37:17.231 --> 01:37:21.702
and I knew right then and
there that if I married you.

1444
01:37:23.437 --> 01:37:24.705
I could never have that.

1445
01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:27.675
I do love you.

1446
01:37:29.443 --> 01:37:33.681
But deep down. I know I
couldn't go through with it.

1447
01:37:36.483 --> 01:37:39.220
I went to the Board. I
was prepared to go down

1448
01:37:39.220 --> 01:37:43.357
in a hail of bullets
if that's what it took.

1449
01:37:43.357 --> 01:37:44.558
Like Bonnie and Clyde.

1450
01:37:47.895 --> 01:37:50.331
Maybe that's what
should have happened then.

1451
01:37:58.272 --> 01:38:01.475
Even when so many
things were right?

1452
01:38:02.877 --> 01:38:04.678
You're the one who
wanted a big wedding.

1453
01:38:10.885 --> 01:38:14.121
If I had come to you
first. would you have left?

1454
01:38:15.656 --> 01:38:17.424
They gave us
everything we wanted.

1455
01:38:18.525 --> 01:38:20.060
There was no reason to run.

1456
01:38:23.097 --> 01:38:25.933
So you're prepared
to die with me.

1457
01:38:27.368 --> 01:38:29.203
but you would've never
left them for me?

1458
01:38:30.204 --> 01:38:31.038
Huh?

1459
01:38:34.308 --> 01:38:38.879
Even if I did. they
would've killed us both.

1460
01:38:38.879 --> 01:38:40.314
I wouldn't want that for you.

1461
01:38:41.548 --> 01:38:43.217
I wouldn't want that for us.

1462
01:38:44.718 --> 01:38:46.253
There is no us.

1463
01:38:48.122 --> 01:38:49.156
Not anymore.

1464
01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:54.762
Well if you're so
through with everything.

1465
01:38:54.762 --> 01:38:57.431
why'd you even come
here in first place?

1466
01:38:57.431 --> 01:38:59.533
Why didn't you just keep running

1467
01:38:59.533 --> 01:39:01.068
if that's what
you really wanted?

1468
01:39:01.068 --> 01:39:05.172
Because hell hath no
fury like a man scorned.

1469
01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:08.442
You're a jilted lover now. babe.

1470
01:39:10.144 --> 01:39:12.079
And once I'm running.

1471
01:39:12.079 --> 01:39:13.647
the teacher that's
gonna come after me.

1472
01:39:13.647 --> 01:39:17.785
the strongest and
the hardest is you

1473
01:39:19.186 --> 01:39:21.422
and I want to drab.
routine kind of a life.

1474
01:39:23.257 --> 01:39:26.961
And I'm willing to die to
try and make that happen.

1475
01:39:35.636 --> 01:39:37.137
Aint love grand?

1476
01:39:43.277 --> 01:39:46.046
I came to say goodbye.

1477
01:39:56.924 --> 01:39:57.925
All right.

1478
01:40:00.828 --> 01:40:01.996
I do love you.

1479
01:40:06.133 --> 01:40:07.301
I always will.

1480
01:40:10.471 --> 01:40:13.140
But one of us has
to die tonight.

1481
01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:13.974
Mm.

1482
01:40:15.542 --> 01:40:19.947
Well I'm not gonna wait
around to play defense.

1483
01:40:19.947 --> 01:40:24.952
This is offense.

1484
01:41:01.922 --> 01:41:04.558
