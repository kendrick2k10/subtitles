3
00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:33.969
This is Darren bond.

4
00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:37.472
The fearless leader
of our story.

5
00:01:38.473 --> 00:01:41.310
A very adventurous character.

6
00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:44.980
Referred to around
these parts as "boombah".

7
00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:49.026
Marlon Perkins was this guy
that does these wildlife shows

8
00:01:49.151 --> 00:01:51.862
back in the 70s and 803
and whatever I grew up with.

9
00:01:51.987 --> 00:01:53.822
White-haired.
elegant-looking guy. anyway...

10
00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:55.425
He was always standing
from a distance.

11
00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:56.825
and he had
his trusted companion.

12
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.119
who was this
big barrel-chested guy.

13
00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:01.955
He was down there. like.
wrestling with a grizzly

14
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.333
while Marlon Perkins
was way up somewhere.

15
00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:05.792
"oh. and look at him!

16
00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:07.502
He's wrestling
with the grizzly bear!"

17
00:02:09.254 --> 00:02:11.256
That's what it feels like
with you guys.

18
00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:14.468
I'm wrestling the grizzly
by jumping off of this

19
00:02:14.593 --> 00:02:16.678
while you guys
safely stand in the tower.

20
00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:18.889
Darren is often
pegged as a workaholic...

21
00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:22.059
Who made a living
from building Bridges.

22
00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:26.497
You want it.
I hook this big one...

23
00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:27.773
Does this feel about right?

24
00:02:27.898 --> 00:02:30.734
Hey! Did you pay the insurance?

25
00:02:32.444 --> 00:02:33.945
Hey. first time I was up here.

26
00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:36.698
took me 15 minutes
and I would refuse to jump.

27
00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:38.533
Look out!

28
00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:44.164
There we go.

29
00:02:44.915 --> 00:02:46.795
It doesn't look like much
when you're down here.

30
00:02:48.752 --> 00:02:51.630
My impression of Darren bond
is something. uh...

31
00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:55.967
That's really hard
to describe with words. um...

32
00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:19.199
Darren was actually
kind of a... a nerdy kid.

33
00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:21.427
What it is... is the alien
takes over this guy's body.

34
00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:23.995
but he's conscious and is still
in his... in his head. right?

35
00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:25.372
But he's trapped.

36
00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:27.416
So he's got this.
it's like this room

37
00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:28.959
with all these... this stuff.

38
00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:31.253
and it's all his baggage.
and all of his.

39
00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:33.178
you know. everything
he's done and everything.

40
00:03:33.255 --> 00:03:35.149
And that's what it feels like
when you come in the bunker.

41
00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:36.383
kind of like it's my brain.

42
00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:37.926
He was born an okie

43
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:39.469
and he still resides
in Oklahoma.

44
00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:45.976
Surrounded by cattle. forests.

45
00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:48.562
fields and a fully
nuclear bunker

46
00:03:48.687 --> 00:03:51.148
with a hidden library
surrounded by an art gallery

47
00:03:51.273 --> 00:03:53.358
attached to a mid-century
Italian chapel.

48
00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:58.780
It's Darren's sanctuary.

49
00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:01.533
For philosophy. art...

50
00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:05.454
And life.

51
00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.166
I guess to understand Mr. Bond
just a little bit better.

52
00:04:09.291 --> 00:04:11.585
I'll need to show you
the hidden world

53
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.128
of the esoteric bunker.

54
00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:23.388
[Lively music playing

55
00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:30.979
Hey. I'm not
a professional. you know.

56
00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:33.315
I live in the middle of nowhere.

57
00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:36.777
This crazy bunker
that Darren has.

58
00:04:36.902 --> 00:04:38.987
that the walls
are lined with books.

59
00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:41.573
and it's dark

60
00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:44.034
but it's so unique and so cool.

61
00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:48.038
The bunker blew my mind.
I was like. it was insane.

62
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.300
The top side. you know.

63
00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:14.981
in the regular building.
there's like.

64
00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:16.483
this church that's in there too.

65
00:05:16.608 --> 00:05:17.984
where I guess
people get married.

66
00:05:26.952 --> 00:05:28.954
So much stuff
that's artwork in there.

67
00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:30.399
it's like.
a lot to absorb. right?

68
00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:32.040
Like. every time
you're in there.

69
00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:34.085
you see something new
that you didn't see before.

70
00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:36.253
Basically. it's got Satan

71
00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:37.855
chained down in the middle.
for the chains.

72
00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:39.089
and then in the middle

73
00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:40.799
the quo represents the serpent.

74
00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:44.761
Each room is like
its own unique thing.

75
00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:55.647
It's the idea
that we live a physical life

76
00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:57.107
in a material world.

77
00:05:57.232 --> 00:05:59.025
If the rain comes.
it makes a mud hole.

78
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.777
and we have to fight through it.

79
00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:02.713
so we have all these things
that we're dealing with

80
00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:04.531
in the world
that the physical world...

81
00:06:04.656 --> 00:06:06.241
But yet what do we
really aspire to?

82
00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:08.034
What are the things
that really move us?

83
00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:09.619
And the things
that move us are...

84
00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:11.464
Is kind of represented
by the term esoteric.

85
00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:12.956
which. it could be anything.

86
00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:14.801
It could be an idea.
it could be a religion.

87
00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:17.544
it could be a...
A narrative of your history.

88
00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:20.005
or whatever.
or it could be art or music.

89
00:06:22.883 --> 00:06:24.151
For this music festival.

90
00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:25.719
that was the esoteric part.

91
00:06:25.844 --> 00:06:27.564
to enjoy this music
together as a community.

92
00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:33.685
None of us
are getting out of this alive.

93
00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:36.354
So it's how we live
that makes a difference.

94
00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:43.904
You gotta take
the good with the bad.

95
00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:46.448
and turn what looks bad
into something good.

96
00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:50.243
The meaning of the bunker part

97
00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:52.162
is the idea
that we pull into ourselves.

98
00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:54.372
I mean. this is
a physical representation.

99
00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:58.585
If you think you could
be saved by being in a bunker.

100
00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.086
you're completely wrong.

101
00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:01.796
Being in the bunker
might make you last

102
00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:03.173
a couple extra weeks.

103
00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:04.925
but it's not going to save you.

104
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.736
and you can't be saved
by being in a bunker anywhere.

105
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.054
That's probably the realization
when it comes to...

106
00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:10.779
I believe in being prepared
for anything.

107
00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:12.450
but you're not gonna
save yourself inside

108
00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:14.160
if you don't have friends
communing around you.

109
00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:15.477
that's what we're creating.

110
00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:17.687
Community is
so the bunker mentality

111
00:07:17.812 --> 00:07:21.024
is something
that we all embrace at times.

112
00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:23.652
it's my tribe
against your tribe.

113
00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:25.862
my country against your country.

114
00:07:25.987 --> 00:07:27.489
And the...
That's part of our ego.

115
00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:28.907
Our ego is there for a reason.

116
00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:30.241
It allows us to survive.

117
00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:31.910
but we have to let go of it

118
00:07:32.035 --> 00:07:33.703
and realize
that we're all the same.

119
00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:35.664
We're all connected.
we are all one.

120
00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:37.707
And if you realize that.

121
00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:40.019
and even apply a little bit
of that thinking to your life.

122
00:07:40.043 --> 00:07:42.295
hopefully it will
help you help us all.

123
00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:49.219
Darren does
some really cool stuff.

124
00:07:49.344 --> 00:07:52.555
His mind never shuts off.
I don't see how the guy sleeps.

125
00:07:53.348 --> 00:07:55.308
Hey. you want
some razzle-dazzle?

126
00:07:58.061 --> 00:07:59.312
How's that?

127
00:07:59.437 --> 00:08:01.398
Darren's got a mind of his own.

128
00:08:01.523 --> 00:08:03.900
He's got some sort of
creativity bug in him

129
00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:05.385
that I can't even
put my finger on.

130
00:08:07.654 --> 00:08:09.948
He had started thinking about

131
00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:12.951
having a music
festival out here.

132
00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:14.577
It is a form of art.

133
00:08:14.703 --> 00:08:17.163
and it's the one
that probably permeates

134
00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:18.999
our daily life
more than anything.

135
00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:25.797
Darren came to me
about three years ago.

136
00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:27.757
I'd say.
wanting to do this thing.

137
00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:30.468
He had an idea for a festival
on his property.

138
00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:33.406
A co-worker asked me
if I wanted to come out

139
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.265
to this guy's property.
about an hour.

140
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.310
hour and a half away
from downtown Oklahoma city.

141
00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:39.477
to see if I thought.
logistically.

142
00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:41.354
it was something
that we could pull off...

143
00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:44.065
Within six to seven months.

144
00:08:47.694 --> 00:08:50.196
A guy by the name
of mikael called me

145
00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:52.991
and he said "I'm planning
to do a festival.

146
00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:55.660
Do you have time to go look
at the property next week?"

147
00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:59.205
It's located
in between shawnee and Ada.

148
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:00.915
a town called Asher.

149
00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:02.584
Just south ofasher. actually.

150
00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:05.128
We get out there.

151
00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:07.839
it's this beautiful
1400-acre ranch.

152
00:09:09.591 --> 00:09:11.384
Down his driveway.
it's two miles.

153
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:13.678
and I'm like "oh my god.
I'm in the middle of nowhere."

154
00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:15.388
It's just massive.

155
00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:22.437
I hear about all these buildings

156
00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:24.773
and all these things
that this guy's built.

157
00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:27.108
Honestly. I didn't believe him.

158
00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:34.908
His brain thinks so much

159
00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:37.494
and he has all this stuff
laying around.

160
00:09:37.619 --> 00:09:39.496
and you're like.
"what is all this stuff for?".

161
00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:41.956
and then you'll stumble
upon 50 safes

162
00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:43.833
that he's made. like.
artwork out of.

163
00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.377
and you're like
"man. this dude is great."

164
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:56.721
It's a really cool bar.

165
00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:59.265
I can definitely
picture myself sitting in there

166
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.059
and drinking
a good old-fashioned

167
00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:02.644
or some bourbon in there.
you know?

168
00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:04.229
My mind was blown.

169
00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:08.149
Getting the lay of the land.

170
00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:09.859
going a mile
toward the Canadian river.

171
00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:11.820
going a mile to the highway

172
00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:13.696
that's just west
of where we're at.

173
00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:15.549
And I... I still haven't seen
all the... the whole property.

174
00:10:15.573 --> 00:10:17.133
It's just.
every time you turn a corner.

175
00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:19.744
there's something
that you've never seen before.

176
00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:21.913
This is a Jewel that I bought.

177
00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:23.665
that put in
our little Halloween...

178
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.208
Haunted forest or whatever.

179
00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:26.960
It's not gonna be. uh.

180
00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:28.586
it's gonna be right over there.

181
00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:30.231
It's just a little area
for some of our ghouls

182
00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:33.550
to run around
and. uh. chase people.

183
00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:35.218
Kind of reminds me the...

184
00:10:36.678 --> 00:10:38.555
That truck on...

185
00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:42.851
Uh. jeepers creepers.
that movie?

186
00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:46.229
Where that guy.
that strange creature

187
00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:48.554
has that truck that he drives
around and nabs everybody.

188
00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:51.776
We kind of realized early
on that he had something cool.

189
00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:54.279
You know. we wanted to be
a part. but the. you know.

190
00:10:54.404 --> 00:10:55.905
the overall vision
wasn't there yet.

191
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.842
We said go. and then
since we're gonna do this.

192
00:10:57.866 --> 00:10:59.677
the question was. could we do
something quick enough now

193
00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:01.619
to actually ha...
Make it happen this year.

194
00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:03.621
was it gonna just need
to flow to next year.

195
00:11:03.746 --> 00:11:06.499
I think we kind of
wanted to make it

196
00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:09.085
a little bit smaller at first.
than he was trying to go.

197
00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:14.090
But we decided to do a 5000-ish
capacity music festival.

198
00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:17.844
If it's a first time for them
to throw a music festival.

199
00:11:17.969 --> 00:11:21.639
some of the questions
we... we tend to have is. uh...

200
00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:23.516
I hope these people know

201
00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:25.081
what they're getting
themselves into.

202
00:11:25.393 --> 00:11:27.729
Hoping they understand
the amount of money

203
00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:29.898
they're about to spend
to do the show.

204
00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:33.026
We wanted this to be
something unique for Oklahoma.

205
00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:35.028
something that hasn't
really been here before.

206
00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:40.533
Different sized stages.

207
00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:44.579
where we could put stages.
where they would need roads.

208
00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:48.124
where they could utilize
some of these giant structures

209
00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:50.168
that Darren
already had in place.

210
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.054
Taking an empty field

211
00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:04.432
and turning it into essentially
a small city for a weekend.

212
00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:05.808
takes a lot.

213
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:13.566
He wanted it to be edm.

214
00:12:13.691 --> 00:12:14.901
Why edm?

215
00:12:15.026 --> 00:12:16.819
Well. uh.
that's just what we chose.

216
00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:19.340
I hadn't... it's not like that
was my genre. preferred genre.

217
00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:20.549
I don't know that much about it.

218
00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:22.450
I know nothing about edm.

219
00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:26.704
I had never heard edm music
before in my life until Friday.

220
00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:30.208
I'd heard that this event
was gonna be edm music.

221
00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:32.752
and I'd still never heard edm.

222
00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:36.506
It doesn't matter

223
00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:37.942
whether you're
a country fan. alternative.

224
00:12:37.966 --> 00:12:39.759
Edm is... those people

225
00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:41.386
are very hardcore
about their music.

226
00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:43.239
and I appreciate that
because I like my music

227
00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:45.515
and it motivates me
and inspires me

228
00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.724
and does all those things.

229
00:12:46.849 --> 00:12:48.309
And so I saw that in him too.

230
00:12:48.434 --> 00:12:50.314
I like these festivals.
because people come here

231
00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:51.705
because they
truly love the music.

232
00:12:51.729 --> 00:12:53.398
It's loud. it's rad.

233
00:12:53.523 --> 00:12:56.109
Well. there's a lot of rhythm
and beat to it.

234
00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:58.528
and if you sit there
and listen to it long enough.

235
00:12:58.653 --> 00:13:00.154
without ever hearing it before.

236
00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.199
you'll find yourself
starting to move.

237
00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:04.844
When people say
you need to be zigging.

238
00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:07.287
I'm usually zagging.
so there... there you go.

239
00:13:09.998 --> 00:13:11.791
Every two weeks.
every three weeks.

240
00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:13.167
they'd hit me up and say.

241
00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:14.603
"okay. we've gotten
to this point.

242
00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:16.629
can we come chat
about this with you now?

243
00:13:16.754 --> 00:13:18.923
Like. we want to put a pad
out there in the field

244
00:13:19.048 --> 00:13:20.508
for the stage line to go on.

245
00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:22.218
What size pad do we need

246
00:13:22.343 --> 00:13:25.013
if we want to be doing shows
five years from now."

247
00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:26.472
And I'm like. "holy cow."

248
00:13:26.597 --> 00:13:28.099
And. uh. every time
we went out there.

249
00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:29.684
we gave the guys advice

250
00:13:30.476 --> 00:13:33.146
and. um. Darren
would roll with it.

251
00:13:39.402 --> 00:13:41.088
We knew
that we're gonna basically go

252
00:13:41.112 --> 00:13:43.614
from our barns and office here
and go... go to the west.

253
00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.284
use that space
of about 20. 30 acres.

254
00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:47.702
And so what did we need to do?

255
00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:49.329
Well. we needed
to change the grass.

256
00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:51.181
We had a kind... type of
grass growing in there

257
00:13:51.205 --> 00:13:53.291
that's built for hay.
it's not built to get a good.

258
00:13:53.416 --> 00:13:55.877
you know. mat of cool grass
underneath your feet.

259
00:13:58.755 --> 00:14:00.515
I gotta run
and get some. uh. tools.

260
00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:03.009
I'll be right back.
I'll let you help me.

261
00:14:04.218 --> 00:14:05.428
He did it all right.

262
00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:07.180
Whatever advice we gave him.

263
00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:09.432
he'd show up two weeks later.
the work was done.

264
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.568
If there anyone interested.

265
00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:22.445
basically. this is
a John deere excavator.

266
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:25.865
and I'm. uh. gonna throw
some trees over the fence.

267
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.450
and that'd be an easy cleanup.

268
00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.328
We own this. uh.
this is part of our. uh.

269
00:14:30.453 --> 00:14:32.914
work tools
that we use to clear land

270
00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:35.583
and dig the dirt
that we built the roads out of.

271
00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:37.770
I gotta be
a little careful here.

272
00:14:37.794 --> 00:14:40.004
because that pipe you see. uh.

273
00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:43.257
by the excavator is actually
a well... a well head.

274
00:14:43.383 --> 00:14:46.594
That's our new well
that we built. uh.

275
00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:49.680
to provide a...
Provide some extra water

276
00:14:49.806 --> 00:14:52.266
for the... for the site.

277
00:14:52.934 --> 00:14:56.312
Uh. we had to put...
Install the system

278
00:14:56.437 --> 00:14:58.731
so that we could put
in our new grass.

279
00:14:58.856 --> 00:15:01.025
So we got our new grass in
and it's... it's in place

280
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:03.736
and we've been growing
on it this season.

281
00:15:03.861 --> 00:15:05.279
It looks pretty good.

282
00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:08.616
but it'll be really good
by sometime next year.

283
00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.452
This area over
to my left is. um.

284
00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:13.413
backstage of the...
Our main stage.

285
00:15:13.538 --> 00:15:15.706
uh. still needs
to be cleaned up.

286
00:15:17.542 --> 00:15:18.977
You know. once
we kind of finally got

287
00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:20.336
the ball rolling
with the artists.

288
00:15:20.461 --> 00:15:22.046
everything kind of
took off from there.

289
00:15:22.171 --> 00:15:25.883
Landing a headliner
like zeds dead and. uh. kayzo.

290
00:15:26.008 --> 00:15:28.261
and some of the other acts
that we had. you know.

291
00:15:28.386 --> 00:15:30.197
definitely gave us
the momentum to push forward.

292
00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:32.765
All of our possible.
you know. uh.

293
00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:35.852
themes or whatever would be
some Halloween orientation.

294
00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:38.271
and then edm fit
that fairly well.

295
00:15:39.147 --> 00:15:40.356
We were talking about. uh.

296
00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:42.584
where to put
some of the zombie props

297
00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:43.818
for these performing artists.

298
00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:45.194
Yeah. Yeah. and we're...

299
00:15:45.319 --> 00:15:47.113
Okay. so...
So on the zombie stuff.

300
00:15:47.238 --> 00:15:49.407
I want to... I'll get some
meat cleaver-looking things.

301
00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:50.992
and we'll. like. get the bl...

302
00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:52.469
I don't. I know nothing...
To buy me fake blood.

303
00:15:52.493 --> 00:15:54.704
But... oh. I'm sorry...
But. like. uh...

304
00:15:57.707 --> 00:15:59.876
Yeah. you've gotta deal
with the blood.

305
00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:02.170
Oh. okay. so like. you know.
packing all over that.

306
00:16:02.295 --> 00:16:04.189
I'll definitely throw some
blood all over this stuff.

307
00:16:04.213 --> 00:16:05.339
Okay. Cool.

308
00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:06.841
So this is going to be something

309
00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:08.235
like universal studios
fright night.

310
00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:09.969
or whatever they call it.

311
00:16:10.094 --> 00:16:12.156
where they run around with
meat cleavers chasing people?

312
00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:13.723
Umnpmn I'm hoping so.

313
00:16:13.848 --> 00:16:16.517
We started designing
the daybreak setup.

314
00:16:16.642 --> 00:16:20.062
the stage setup. with the...
The masked-out video wall

315
00:16:20.188 --> 00:16:21.981
with the circle truss around it.

316
00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:26.527
the... the fire.
and I would say by... by August.

317
00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:28.779
all the final designs
were submitted.

318
00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:30.698
and we chose
what we were gonna do.

319
00:16:30.823 --> 00:16:32.366
And it was go time.

320
00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:35.411
We just had to wait until
October to execute a show.

321
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.672
Today's October 22nd.

322
00:16:46.797 --> 00:16:48.132
As of four hours ago.

323
00:16:48.257 --> 00:16:51.052
we have less
than 48 hours until doors.

324
00:16:52.053 --> 00:16:54.639
We got rain
within the past 24 hours.

325
00:16:54.764 --> 00:16:55.973
we had a tornado touch down

326
00:16:56.098 --> 00:16:58.476
within two miles
of this location.

327
00:16:58.601 --> 00:17:00.787
So we're kind of still dealing
with a little bit of issues

328
00:17:00.811 --> 00:17:02.522
in regards to some of. uh.

329
00:17:02.647 --> 00:17:03.981
the infrastructure
we have built.

330
00:17:10.613 --> 00:17:12.323
The artists are coming.

331
00:17:12.448 --> 00:17:14.468
and they're going to be here
whether we're ready or not.

332
00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:16.953
so it's kind of like.
what can you prioritize

333
00:17:17.078 --> 00:17:18.996
and get done
in the least amount of time.

334
00:17:19.121 --> 00:17:20.665
You know. there are
a couple of places

335
00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.309
where we could add
a little more surface course.

336
00:17:22.333 --> 00:17:24.835
just in case we get
some unexpected weather.

337
00:17:26.128 --> 00:17:28.048
I don't know whether
it was the right thing to do

338
00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:29.215
or the wrong thing to do.

339
00:17:30.007 --> 00:17:31.717
It was gonna be
a huge undertaking.

340
00:17:31.842 --> 00:17:34.345
but with Darren's skillset.

341
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:38.015
I felt like. and I still
feel like it's something

342
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.184
that we're going
to be able to manage.

343
00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:43.729
Music industry.
when the doors open at four.

344
00:17:43.854 --> 00:17:45.439
the doors open at four.

345
00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:47.608
You can't have. you know.

346
00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:49.002
in this case we'll probably have

347
00:17:49.026 --> 00:17:50.736
at least
3000 people at the gate.

348
00:17:51.487 --> 00:17:52.947
We can't be
not opening the doors.

349
00:17:53.072 --> 00:17:54.574
that's just gonna create issues

350
00:17:54.699 --> 00:17:56.492
and. uh. hopefully we...

351
00:17:56.617 --> 00:17:58.953
I know we can tackle those
issues if they arise.

352
00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:03.833
but I would rather... rather
not have to leap that hurdle.

353
00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:12.466
I... there's
a story about buddy.

354
00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:14.802
I got. uh. a lot of the...

355
00:18:14.927 --> 00:18:16.363
A lot of the stuff that I'm
incorporating in the buildings

356
00:18:16.387 --> 00:18:18.306
came from a particular
junkyard in Ada.

357
00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:20.016
When they sold
the property and left.

358
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.310
left their dogs...
Left three dogs there.

359
00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:24.520
and even after a year.
being abandoned.

360
00:18:24.645 --> 00:18:26.081
buddy was the only one
that survived.

361
00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:28.190
So anyway.
when I got thejunk I. uh...

362
00:18:29.358 --> 00:18:32.153
I took some dog food
and coaxed him

363
00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:34.947
into finally. uh.
getting close to me.

364
00:18:35.072 --> 00:18:36.490
then I got
to know him a little bit.

365
00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:38.218
and about a week later.
I snatched him up.

366
00:18:38.242 --> 00:18:39.886
put him in the pickup
and he came back here

367
00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:42.288
and seems to enjoy it.

368
00:18:42.413 --> 00:18:43.539
We're glad to have him.

369
00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:45.833
Right. buddy? Come here!

370
00:18:46.626 --> 00:18:47.793
Come on!

371
00:18:47.918 --> 00:18:49.962
Are you moving slow today? Huh?

372
00:18:52.506 --> 00:18:53.549
Huh?

373
00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:58.387
Stuff that. uh.
they use at the. uh.

374
00:18:58.512 --> 00:19:00.640
at the music festivals
is three phased.

375
00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:02.224
So we had. uh.

376
00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.270
uh. did some kind of...
I don't know what it was.

377
00:19:04.393 --> 00:19:06.204
some kind of convertor
or something to make it work.

378
00:19:06.228 --> 00:19:09.106
Otherwise they were gonna have
to spend 360.000 dollars

379
00:19:09.231 --> 00:19:11.734
to actually bring three bays
all the way to here.

380
00:19:11.859 --> 00:19:13.569
But anyway. we got it going.

381
00:19:13.694 --> 00:19:16.614
so hopefully when we plug it
in here in a couple of days.

382
00:19:16.739 --> 00:19:18.115
it'll all work.

383
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.840
But that's what I know
about electricity.

384
00:19:34.882 --> 00:19:39.970
J“ hey brother. it's time
to put your hands on j“

385
00:19:40.096 --> 00:19:43.599
j“ because we're building
a stage to stand on j“

386
00:19:43.724 --> 00:19:48.104
j“ oh. we 're building
a stage to stand on j“

387
00:19:48.229 --> 00:19:50.731
j“ getting taller and taller j“

388
00:19:51.565 --> 00:19:52.858
Some of the challenges

389
00:19:52.983 --> 00:19:54.443
that we started facing
along the way

390
00:19:54.568 --> 00:19:56.445
was getting this venue
built up from scratch.

391
00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:58.739
80 building the stages
was most priority.

392
00:20:08.082 --> 00:20:09.709
We saw the chances of rain.

393
00:20:09.834 --> 00:20:11.687
They were started looking out
10 days or two weeks.

394
00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:13.003
which didn't mean anything.

395
00:20:13.129 --> 00:20:14.606
but when you get down
to the last week.

396
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.149
you can see
that we definitely had a day

397
00:20:16.173 --> 00:20:17.925
that we're gonna be impacted.

398
00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.986
but I didn't... didn't worry
about it really much then.

399
00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:21.610
because I thought
our impact was gonna be

400
00:20:21.637 --> 00:20:23.556
on setup day
on Thursday. mainly.

401
00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:27.143
About eight o'clock.

402
00:20:27.268 --> 00:20:29.353
you could hear
the first raindrops falling.

403
00:20:29.478 --> 00:20:32.231
which we expected.
but then it started.

404
00:20:37.862 --> 00:20:40.197
October being
the second-wettest month

405
00:20:40.322 --> 00:20:41.699
of the year here in Oklahoma.

406
00:20:41.824 --> 00:20:43.367
and we laughed about it.

407
00:20:43.492 --> 00:20:46.328
we were like "we'll be fine.
man. we'll be fine."

408
00:20:46.454 --> 00:20:49.081
And nine inches of rain later...

409
00:20:50.624 --> 00:20:53.210
It was the second-wettest
month in Oklahoma.

410
00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:57.339
Wednesday night.
the bottom falls out.

411
00:20:57.465 --> 00:20:59.133
and it just pours.

412
00:21:02.511 --> 00:21:04.722
Called battle.
and we made the call

413
00:21:04.847 --> 00:21:06.515
to go ahead and set the stage.

414
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.059
Wednesday night
at 10:30 with no light.

415
00:21:09.185 --> 00:21:10.311
it started raining.

416
00:21:13.397 --> 00:21:15.858
When it started
raining so early.

417
00:21:15.983 --> 00:21:19.445
so hard. that was
when I was concerned.

418
00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:23.240
We were literally walking into
the perfect storm. essentially.

419
00:21:30.998 --> 00:21:32.374
This is big creek.

420
00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.502
It's a little bit bigger
than it normally is.

421
00:21:34.627 --> 00:21:36.879
it really is normally
not very big at all.

422
00:21:37.004 --> 00:21:39.965
but. uh. got a little...
Kind of shows

423
00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:41.530
that we did get
a little bit of rain.

424
00:21:42.426 --> 00:21:44.178
Oklahoma weather changes

425
00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:46.096
in a matter of 30 minutes.

426
00:21:46.222 --> 00:21:47.848
I'm sure
it does everywhere else.

427
00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:50.643
but in Oklahoma
it... it can be heaven or hell

428
00:21:50.768 --> 00:21:51.811
within 30 minutes.

429
00:21:51.936 --> 00:21:53.896
anditcan be unprecedented.

430
00:21:54.021 --> 00:21:55.523
no warning whatsoever.

431
00:21:55.648 --> 00:21:57.358
My guys show up in the bus.

432
00:21:57.483 --> 00:22:00.653
and I show up.
and the field is just muddy.

433
00:22:01.403 --> 00:22:02.883
That looks a lot of water.
doesn't it?

434
00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:09.537
It looks like. uh. our pipe
got broke or something.

435
00:22:09.662 --> 00:22:11.497
probably. out there
in the middle of the...

436
00:22:12.665 --> 00:22:13.958
Middle of the sand.

437
00:22:14.083 --> 00:22:15.709
and so the drainage
pipe got stuck.

438
00:22:16.377 --> 00:22:18.217
Oh. loo... hey. look.
it's bubbling over there!

439
00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:20.923
Well. rain's an issue
with any property

440
00:22:21.048 --> 00:22:22.359
because nobody likes
to. obviously.

441
00:22:22.383 --> 00:22:24.468
stand in mud
or water to do anything.

442
00:22:24.593 --> 00:22:26.387
It makes everything complicated.

443
00:22:26.512 --> 00:22:28.740
We do have certain segments
of the ground that we prepared.

444
00:22:28.764 --> 00:22:32.434
that we put new soil on.
to grow better grass.

445
00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.186
And so those tend
to be a little muddier.

446
00:22:34.311 --> 00:22:36.522
And it's just gonna be
a long day.

447
00:22:36.647 --> 00:22:38.583
The parking crew are gonna
have to work really slow.

448
00:22:38.607 --> 00:22:40.293
Right. what... what...
What we need to do is.

449
00:22:40.317 --> 00:22:42.254
we need to make sure that...
That... that we're gonna...

450
00:22:42.278 --> 00:22:44.405
We're g...
We'll create some exits

451
00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:46.031
and our entrances
or whatever off

452
00:22:46.156 --> 00:22:47.867
of... of the areas
that we want them to go.

453
00:22:47.992 --> 00:22:49.386
I just made
the common... I was like.

454
00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:50.953
"well. you see. this big giant.

455
00:22:51.078 --> 00:22:52.806
like. two-and-a-half-inch.
three-inch rock here.

456
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:55.249
if you could get
a lot of that here.

457
00:22:55.374 --> 00:22:58.335
we'd probably be able
to at least work back and forth

458
00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.004
and... and get
stuff to the stage.

459
00:23:00.129 --> 00:23:02.590
and get it installed.
and as stuff dries up.

460
00:23:02.715 --> 00:23:04.925
we'll be able to use
that element of the show

461
00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:07.052
and in... incorporate it
into the stage.

462
00:23:07.177 --> 00:23:09.597
Oh. you know the roads
are relatively stable

463
00:23:09.722 --> 00:23:12.308
but. you know.
the back stage is a bit. um...

464
00:23:13.267 --> 00:23:15.603
No. it's... you go over there.
it's... it's gets messed up.

465
00:23:15.728 --> 00:23:17.104
so we gotta fix it.

466
00:23:17.229 --> 00:23:19.523
so they can
do their thing there. and...

467
00:23:19.648 --> 00:23:21.191
I would like all five of 'em.

468
00:23:21.317 --> 00:23:22.985
and then... and then. uh.

469
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.629
depending on our needs
we'll probably just turn around

470
00:23:24.653 --> 00:23:26.614
and go do another...
Another round or two.

471
00:23:27.448 --> 00:23:29.658
Gonna call my dozer guy
and see what kind of rock

472
00:23:29.783 --> 00:23:31.493
he's been getting
from one quarry.

473
00:23:31.619 --> 00:23:33.662
We got five more trucks
coming from another quarry.

474
00:23:34.371 --> 00:23:35.456
So we've. uh...

475
00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.126
Got about twelve trucks
making two or three rounds.

476
00:23:39.251 --> 00:23:42.087
so we'll have forty...
Four days over

477
00:23:42.212 --> 00:23:45.049
at forty loads of rock
to use wherever we need it.

478
00:23:45.174 --> 00:23:47.676
No joke. fifteen.
twenty minutes later...

479
00:23:49.219 --> 00:23:52.264
Dump trucks
and semi-folds of rock show up.

480
00:24:02.399 --> 00:24:04.068
I'll get out of your way.

481
00:24:04.193 --> 00:24:06.004
and you just bring the lot
around there to that dozer.

482
00:24:06.028 --> 00:24:08.268
he's gonna help you dump there
in the middle of the road.

483
00:24:40.562 --> 00:24:42.398
Spending all the extra money
on. you know...

484
00:24:42.523 --> 00:24:43.923
Whether or not
it's my money or not.

485
00:24:44.024 --> 00:24:45.985
just trying
to watch out for Darren

486
00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:47.987
and being as up front
as possible as. you know.

487
00:24:48.112 --> 00:24:49.592
this is going
to cost a lot more money

488
00:24:49.655 --> 00:24:51.073
to keep this thing going.

489
00:24:51.198 --> 00:24:52.592
I'm not
that worried about the product

490
00:24:52.616 --> 00:24:54.284
one way or the other.
just availability

491
00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:56.471
and get it here so we can
put it in the right spot. so...

492
00:24:56.495 --> 00:24:57.855
But anyway. yeah.
I'll wait for you

493
00:24:57.955 --> 00:24:59.206
and I'll... I'll...

494
00:25:00.958 --> 00:25:02.876
Uh. it's electronic dance music.

495
00:25:03.002 --> 00:25:06.005
um. got about 75 bands.
and we're gonna have

496
00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:07.548
several thousand
people for sure.

497
00:25:07.673 --> 00:25:09.675
but. uh. other than that...

498
00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.468
It's gonna look...
It's gonna be fun.

499
00:25:11.593 --> 00:25:13.095
but it's... it's not...

500
00:25:14.054 --> 00:25:15.514
It's not exactly
what you wanted.

501
00:25:15.639 --> 00:25:18.225
You don't want
the flood the day before.

502
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:20.227
but I mean.
all things considered.

503
00:25:20.352 --> 00:25:22.062
I'm... we're in...
We're in decent shape.

504
00:25:22.187 --> 00:25:23.188
It's been better.

505
00:25:23.313 --> 00:25:24.314
I got... we got. like.

506
00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.150
trucks out the wazoo now.

507
00:25:26.275 --> 00:25:28.169
I don't know how many we need.
but I'll probably get us

508
00:25:28.193 --> 00:25:31.113
at least four loads
of. uh... of mulch.

509
00:25:31.238 --> 00:25:32.531
that way we can put it

510
00:25:32.656 --> 00:25:33.967
in different places
for foot traffic.

511
00:25:33.991 --> 00:25:35.951
Hey guys!
On that... is that y'all's?

512
00:25:36.076 --> 00:25:37.327
Are you all driving this?

513
00:25:38.037 --> 00:25:39.747
Y'all driving that?
Okay. Thank you.

514
00:25:39.872 --> 00:25:42.750
I'm enjoying interacting
with the... the people

515
00:25:42.875 --> 00:25:44.918
that are coming here.
you know. uh. once we kind of

516
00:25:45.044 --> 00:25:46.524
get out of the crisis mode.
hopefully.

517
00:25:47.379 --> 00:25:50.466
Uh. but we've got
everything stabilized right now

518
00:25:50.591 --> 00:25:52.471
fairly well. I think.
for what we're doing here.

519
00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:55.429
with our vendors
and getting our artists in.

520
00:25:55.554 --> 00:25:57.765
and getting
production stuff going.

521
00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:59.308
so I'm comfortable with that.

522
00:25:59.433 --> 00:26:01.018
but then the...
The challenge will be...

523
00:26:01.143 --> 00:26:02.311
Uh...

524
00:26:03.645 --> 00:26:05.105
This thing's. uh...

525
00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:06.990
When... when everybody
gets here.

526
00:26:07.066 --> 00:26:09.109
When you get. you know.
hundreds of cars here.

527
00:26:09.234 --> 00:26:10.778
and they start pulling them in.

528
00:26:10.903 --> 00:26:13.030
then it'll be... they'll be
different challenges.

529
00:26:13.572 --> 00:26:16.867
So we have nine.
ten. eleven. twelve...

530
00:26:16.992 --> 00:26:18.702
We have 14 trucks running.

531
00:26:19.369 --> 00:26:20.370
Who's in my spot?

532
00:26:20.496 --> 00:26:22.122
Yes. that's your spot?

533
00:26:22.247 --> 00:26:24.142
- That's my spot. man!
- Oh. you want it back?

534
00:26:24.166 --> 00:26:25.366
Who are you? Come on!

535
00:26:25.417 --> 00:26:26.668
- Tell me who you are!
- Skyler.

536
00:26:26.794 --> 00:26:28.545
Skyler.
nice to meet you. Skyler.

537
00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:29.981
I'm a merchandise
vendor; I'm with deval Chicago.

538
00:26:30.005 --> 00:26:31.757
If you need it. you can have it.

539
00:26:31.882 --> 00:26:33.276
We're temporarily sitting here.
I'm trying to figure out...

540
00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.094
Stay there.
I'll go some place else.

541
00:26:35.219 --> 00:26:37.596
Typically
if we do. like. an arena show.

542
00:26:37.721 --> 00:26:40.849
you can flip 30 trucks
in five or six hours.

543
00:26:40.974 --> 00:26:43.852
Out there.
'cause of the elements.

544
00:26:43.977 --> 00:26:45.896
everything was coming
off the truck by what...

545
00:26:46.021 --> 00:26:49.399
What we call an "off-road."
"forklift." or a "lull."

546
00:26:50.526 --> 00:26:53.153
Each semi was
about three to four hours

547
00:26:53.278 --> 00:26:54.947
at a time to offload it.

548
00:26:55.072 --> 00:26:57.366
You're only able
to do two cases at a time.

549
00:26:57.491 --> 00:26:58.951
and then get it
over to the stage.

550
00:26:59.076 --> 00:27:01.453
cause the... the semis
were stuck in mud.

551
00:27:02.246 --> 00:27:04.456
Uh. so we were unable
to back 'em up to the stage

552
00:27:04.581 --> 00:27:06.500
like we typically
would to offload them.

553
00:27:09.169 --> 00:27:11.797
It really slowed
down the loading time.

554
00:27:11.922 --> 00:27:15.926
and it made it. uh
just like a fourteen-hour day.

555
00:27:16.051 --> 00:27:17.611
And we still
didn't get everything done.

556
00:27:17.719 --> 00:27:18.762
in that first day.

557
00:27:21.014 --> 00:27:23.433
There was no way
for us to prepare

558
00:27:23.559 --> 00:27:25.394
what we were
getting ourselves into.

559
00:27:30.983 --> 00:27:32.401
Daybreak? Oh. man.

560
00:27:32.526 --> 00:27:34.611
It's been a wild ride.
I'll be honest.

561
00:27:34.736 --> 00:27:35.863
like. get here. you know?

562
00:27:35.988 --> 00:27:37.447
It's raining. pouring down.

563
00:27:37.573 --> 00:27:40.159
We roll up. this guy
named Paul picked us up

564
00:27:40.284 --> 00:27:41.410
in a pickup truck lift.

565
00:27:41.535 --> 00:27:42.911
I've never been

566
00:27:43.036 --> 00:27:44.556
in a truck lift in my life.
by the way.

567
00:27:44.663 --> 00:27:47.040
But... so we roll up
through the mud. you know.

568
00:27:47.166 --> 00:27:48.500
trucking through. four...

569
00:27:48.625 --> 00:27:50.169
Like. four wheel drive.
getting here.

570
00:27:51.086 --> 00:27:54.381
Pull up. hop out the car.
he says "welcome to Oklahoma."

571
00:27:58.427 --> 00:28:01.054
Whenever you have
thousands of pounds of gear.

572
00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:03.473
coming out of semis.
it's hard to get

573
00:28:03.599 --> 00:28:06.393
across a muddy field
to deliver the product

574
00:28:06.518 --> 00:28:08.228
that you're trying to
to those stages.

575
00:28:08.353 --> 00:28:10.480
and make it flow
the way it should.

576
00:28:14.568 --> 00:28:16.028
I... I drove around

577
00:28:16.153 --> 00:28:17.654
with a couple people
in the truck...

578
00:28:18.488 --> 00:28:21.700
Uh. assessed what was happening
and what was about to happen.

579
00:28:21.825 --> 00:28:25.621
and. I just.
physically and financially

580
00:28:25.746 --> 00:28:27.789
thought it was gonna be
really difficult

581
00:28:27.915 --> 00:28:29.124
to make the show go on.

582
00:28:31.126 --> 00:28:33.486
We couldn't even get
the semis to the loading dock.

583
00:28:33.545 --> 00:28:35.505
'cause the semis were
getting stuck in the mud.

584
00:28:36.215 --> 00:28:38.508
The off-road forklifts
were getting stuck.

585
00:28:38.634 --> 00:28:40.886
And they were having to
pull them out with bulldozers.

586
00:28:55.943 --> 00:28:59.196
The only thing
that we didn't foresee

587
00:28:59.321 --> 00:29:01.073
was the... the weather.

588
00:29:04.076 --> 00:29:05.911
After doing it for twelve years.

589
00:29:06.036 --> 00:29:09.665
I've never seen
a festival ground so wet.

590
00:29:15.379 --> 00:29:17.339
Knowing how long
it had taken on the build.

591
00:29:17.464 --> 00:29:20.092
just to build one stage.
the main stage.

592
00:29:20.217 --> 00:29:22.928
and. like. all the things
that weren't going to. like.

593
00:29:23.053 --> 00:29:26.014
be able to fire off
that night. like.

594
00:29:26.139 --> 00:29:29.101
I just did not see
it all working out.

595
00:29:29.935 --> 00:29:31.829
I've seen festivals shut down
because they weren't prepared

596
00:29:31.853 --> 00:29:33.146
for this type of stuff.

597
00:29:33.272 --> 00:29:35.649
This is a classic
three-act play. whatever.

598
00:29:35.774 --> 00:29:38.402
- Exactly. exactly. go.
- Setup. conflict. resolution.

599
00:29:38.527 --> 00:29:39.629
Sure. no problem there.

600
00:29:39.653 --> 00:29:40.862
All right.

601
00:29:40.988 --> 00:29:42.382
80 this is the climax right now?

602
00:29:42.406 --> 00:29:43.508
- This is the conflict.
- Ooh.

603
00:29:43.532 --> 00:29:44.908
One. one after the other.

604
00:29:45.033 --> 00:29:46.552
it's roads.
and then it's fire marshal.

605
00:29:46.576 --> 00:29:48.453
and then it's lasers.
and then it's pyro.

606
00:29:48.578 --> 00:29:50.580
I was completely
determined to see it through.

607
00:29:50.706 --> 00:29:52.958
because the biggest fail
that I could have

608
00:29:53.083 --> 00:29:55.252
as the guy running it
was to cancel it.

609
00:29:55.377 --> 00:29:57.230
We couldn't do that.
and we didn't want to do that.

610
00:29:57.254 --> 00:29:59.134
because these people
were here to see the music.

611
00:30:01.675 --> 00:30:03.260
I felt like we need
to shut it down.

612
00:30:03.385 --> 00:30:05.220
it felt like. um...

613
00:30:07.389 --> 00:30:09.683
Ours getting.
like. blasted with people.

614
00:30:09.808 --> 00:30:11.601
like. you know. like.

615
00:30:11.727 --> 00:30:14.187
hit me up. "what's going on?

616
00:30:14.313 --> 00:30:15.731
I'm trying to get in.

617
00:30:15.856 --> 00:30:17.733
I can't. 'cause people
are getting stuck."

618
00:30:17.858 --> 00:30:19.836
You need to think about this.
you know. you didn't...

619
00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:21.629
You need to think
about cancelling. potentially.

620
00:30:21.653 --> 00:30:23.423
I don't know what your
cancellation insurance is like.

621
00:30:23.447 --> 00:30:24.823
but you need to look into it.

622
00:30:24.948 --> 00:30:27.117
And Darren's response
was "cancel what?"

623
00:30:27.242 --> 00:30:28.722
I never had
any thoughts of giving up.

624
00:30:28.827 --> 00:30:30.203
but I'm... some of the troops.

625
00:30:30.329 --> 00:30:31.872
asked that question
at a point in time.

626
00:30:31.997 --> 00:30:35.000
a couple of times.
but I think we made that clear

627
00:30:35.125 --> 00:30:36.376
that that wasn't gonna happen.

628
00:30:38.503 --> 00:30:39.897
He was looking
kind of different stuff.

629
00:30:39.921 --> 00:30:42.007
but mentally.
I was just in this state

630
00:30:42.132 --> 00:30:44.092
where I...
I couldn't see the end.

631
00:30:45.052 --> 00:30:47.721
Sometimes when you get
in a bad place in your mind.

632
00:30:47.846 --> 00:30:49.973
even when you realize
what the problems are.

633
00:30:50.098 --> 00:30:51.617
and you start
fixing them. some people.

634
00:30:51.641 --> 00:30:53.119
they just... they want
to dwell on the problems

635
00:30:53.143 --> 00:30:54.561
like from the beginning.

636
00:30:54.686 --> 00:30:56.326
even though you're
solving them as you go.

637
00:31:09.368 --> 00:31:10.660
It wasn't perfect.

638
00:31:10.786 --> 00:31:12.454
There were gonna be
people get stuck.

639
00:31:22.047 --> 00:31:24.257
I was watching it
along on Facebook.

640
00:31:24.383 --> 00:31:26.703
and seeing where the rain...
And people were getting stuck.

641
00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.887
and Darren was hauling in rock.

642
00:31:29.012 --> 00:31:31.473
and just wood chips. you know.

643
00:31:31.598 --> 00:31:35.018
all around the margins.
and. uh. told my wife.

644
00:31:35.143 --> 00:31:36.812
I was like
"I think Darren's in trouble."

645
00:31:40.315 --> 00:31:42.085
We... we had
a four-wheel drive pickup.

646
00:31:42.109 --> 00:31:44.444
and we had a tow strap.
you know. which I brought in.

647
00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:46.005
'cause it's. you know.
from what I'd seen

648
00:31:46.029 --> 00:31:49.074
on Facebook.
so. uh... yeah. I was just.

649
00:31:49.199 --> 00:31:50.867
they'd hook it up. and I'd pull.

650
00:32:04.506 --> 00:32:05.733
They didn't worry about it.

651
00:32:05.757 --> 00:32:06.877
Some of them just got stuck.

652
00:32:06.967 --> 00:32:08.427
and went about their business.

653
00:32:08.552 --> 00:32:10.071
and... some of them
moved a little bit.

654
00:32:10.095 --> 00:32:11.346
or whatever. but. you know?

655
00:32:11.471 --> 00:32:12.681
We're all in it together.

656
00:32:27.946 --> 00:32:29.590
You don't really
trust Oklahoma weather.

657
00:32:29.614 --> 00:32:30.699
I figured out.

658
00:32:32.534 --> 00:32:33.869
It might just shut down.

659
00:32:33.994 --> 00:32:35.434
They mightjust
call it at this point.

660
00:32:37.247 --> 00:32:38.558
There was the first night.

661
00:32:38.582 --> 00:32:40.041
it was just raining in sheets

662
00:32:40.167 --> 00:32:41.543
as the main acts were going on.

663
00:32:45.547 --> 00:32:48.133
J“ day is breaking j“

664
00:32:49.468 --> 00:32:51.178
j“ we're gonna start a fire j“

665
00:32:55.974 --> 00:32:59.728
j“ long time waiting j“

666
00:32:59.853 --> 00:33:01.980
j“ flames keep getting higher j“

667
00:33:11.448 --> 00:33:14.159
It was just
like a monsoon soaking.

668
00:33:14.284 --> 00:33:16.012
and it just kept raining
and raining and raining.

669
00:33:16.036 --> 00:33:17.621
J“ we're gonna start a fire j“

670
00:33:22.083 --> 00:33:25.003
j“ hell or heaven j“

671
00:33:25.128 --> 00:33:27.422
everything was
under a hydraulic structure.

672
00:33:27.547 --> 00:33:29.341
we had the walls up on it.

673
00:33:29.466 --> 00:33:33.303
uh. problem was the rain
was coming in sideways.

674
00:33:36.264 --> 00:33:38.683
For about 12 to 16 hours.

675
00:33:38.808 --> 00:33:41.853
and it got the lighting
system completely soaked.

676
00:33:45.732 --> 00:33:47.943
The soak hold.
the consoles were shutting off.

677
00:33:48.068 --> 00:33:50.320
We had to find jet heaters
to keep them going.

678
00:33:50.445 --> 00:33:51.780
Not really sure if you're going

679
00:33:51.905 --> 00:33:53.299
to make it
through the weekend because

680
00:33:53.323 --> 00:33:54.950
the conditions are so terrible.

681
00:33:55.075 --> 00:33:56.469
you're not really sure
if somebody's going to cancel.

682
00:33:56.493 --> 00:33:57.762
or one of the headliners
is gonna decide

683
00:33:57.786 --> 00:33:59.079
he doesn't want to play because

684
00:33:59.204 --> 00:34:00.564
his special effects
aren't working.

685
00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:11.633
When people were coming in.

686
00:34:11.758 --> 00:34:13.426
they were committed
to being there.

687
00:34:13.552 --> 00:34:15.720
And so we were equally
committed to doing what it took

688
00:34:15.845 --> 00:34:18.431
to assist them
to get there and stay there.

689
00:34:19.766 --> 00:34:21.366
Didn't matter
how much it was gonna rain.

690
00:34:21.476 --> 00:34:23.061
once the place was super soaked.

691
00:34:23.186 --> 00:34:24.604
it was super soaked.

692
00:34:24.729 --> 00:34:26.374
The rain and all the mud
and everything. you know.

693
00:34:26.398 --> 00:34:27.774
the situation gets in the way.

694
00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:29.043
and people
don't want to go through that.

695
00:34:29.067 --> 00:34:30.402
And I feel that.

696
00:34:30.527 --> 00:34:32.112
And so you get this
idea in your head.

697
00:34:32.237 --> 00:34:34.364
like "oh. it might be
the same situation for me.

698
00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:36.783
Maybe no one's gonna come out
because it's still muddy.

699
00:34:36.908 --> 00:34:38.261
Maybe no one's
gonna do this." you know?

700
00:34:38.285 --> 00:34:39.995
Where's mikael. do you know?

701
00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.205
Mikael. he just went up front.

702
00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:43.970
He just went up to the box.

703
00:34:44.082 --> 00:34:45.542
- The box up...
- That way. Okay.

704
00:34:47.544 --> 00:34:49.424
I swear. I thought
they said mikael was up here.

705
00:34:52.215 --> 00:34:56.219
Two-wheel drive
Honda civics just blast

706
00:34:56.344 --> 00:34:59.931
through the mud
and semis getting stuck.

707
00:35:00.056 --> 00:35:02.851
and forklifts getting stuck.

708
00:35:02.976 --> 00:35:05.854
and people getting stuck.

709
00:35:05.979 --> 00:35:07.522
Tents getting stuck.

710
00:35:07.647 --> 00:35:09.107
Everything getting stuck.

711
00:35:09.232 --> 00:35:11.776
Oh. just didn't ever see that.

712
00:35:11.901 --> 00:35:12.986
That was crazy.

713
00:35:13.111 --> 00:35:15.196
It looked like a war zone.

714
00:35:15.322 --> 00:35:16.757
You know.
people are getting stuck

715
00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:18.366
in the mud right and left.

716
00:35:18.491 --> 00:35:20.869
As an event producer.
you know. you have to start

717
00:35:20.994 --> 00:35:23.288
thinking about "is this...
Are these conditions safe?"

718
00:35:23.413 --> 00:35:25.582
In my mind.
like. I could just see

719
00:35:25.707 --> 00:35:27.792
people. like. not making it.

720
00:35:27.917 --> 00:35:30.670
like. sleeping in their tents.
and like. the water filling up.

721
00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:33.715
and... drowning.
like. it was scaring me.

722
00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.800
I just couldn't see
the... I couldn't see it

723
00:35:35.925 --> 00:35:37.177
at the end of it.

724
00:35:37.302 --> 00:35:38.654
You know. okay...
We... we gotta do

725
00:35:38.678 --> 00:35:39.929
what we gotta do.

726
00:35:40.055 --> 00:35:41.473
We... we can't do it.
and basically.

727
00:35:41.598 --> 00:35:43.326
this is when we. need you
to use your social media

728
00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:45.030
to explain to people
what we're up against.

729
00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:46.478
but we're going on anyway.

730
00:35:46.603 --> 00:35:48.355
And it may not be
to the highest quality.

731
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.731
but what else are you gonna do?

732
00:35:49.856 --> 00:35:51.125
We're gonna
shut down and go home?

733
00:35:51.149 --> 00:35:52.776
I don't think so.

734
00:35:52.901 --> 00:35:54.629
So. why can't we communicate
to that. to these kids?

735
00:35:54.653 --> 00:35:56.363
These kids will do it.
and they'll say.

736
00:35:56.488 --> 00:35:57.673
"hey! This is a... this..."

737
00:35:57.697 --> 00:35:59.282
I know. I know.

738
00:35:59.407 --> 00:36:01.260
But I want you to...
I want you to explain to 'em.

739
00:36:01.284 --> 00:36:02.845
because you're always worried
what they're thinking.

740
00:36:02.869 --> 00:36:04.469
Well. fine. tell 'em
what we're thinking.

741
00:36:04.537 --> 00:36:05.777
tell 'em what we're up against.

742
00:36:12.754 --> 00:36:15.882
Ten am. On Friday.
and we just finished

743
00:36:16.007 --> 00:36:19.427
installing the. uh...
The waterproof lighting system.

744
00:36:19.552 --> 00:36:22.847
Mikael was really
concerned with the amount

745
00:36:22.972 --> 00:36:25.934
of water
that the grounds were holding.

746
00:36:26.935 --> 00:36:28.978
He had been. uh. doing some laps

747
00:36:29.104 --> 00:36:31.481
around in the truck.
and checking stuff out.

748
00:36:31.606 --> 00:36:33.191
You know.
it wasn't going my way.

749
00:36:33.316 --> 00:36:34.776
You know.
the way that I had an...

750
00:36:34.901 --> 00:36:37.445
Kind of envisioned it.
uh. fall into play.

751
00:36:43.868 --> 00:36:44.994
We're kind of. uh.

752
00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.871
assessing the current situation.

753
00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:48.790
At one point...

754
00:36:49.582 --> 00:36:51.918
We're like "should we do this?

755
00:36:52.043 --> 00:36:53.795
Should we not?"
And Darren looks at us.

756
00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.297
And he's like
"we've come this far.

757
00:36:56.423 --> 00:36:57.716
we're doing a show.

758
00:36:57.841 --> 00:36:59.968
What do we need
to make it happen?"

759
00:37:00.093 --> 00:37:04.097
It's been raining now for...
I don't know how long.

760
00:37:04.222 --> 00:37:07.308
but it's been raining
for a day. day and a half.

761
00:37:07.434 --> 00:37:08.852
it's supposed
to rain all day today.

762
00:37:08.977 --> 00:37:11.229
it's supposed to. uh...
Maybe kind of stop

763
00:37:11.354 --> 00:37:12.814
sometime
in the morning. I think.

764
00:37:12.939 --> 00:37:15.608
So. hopefully we'll have...

765
00:37:15.734 --> 00:37:18.278
The final day will be. uh...

766
00:37:18.403 --> 00:37:19.904
Have some sunshine for the...

767
00:37:20.947 --> 00:37:22.907
For the... the final big day.

768
00:37:23.032 --> 00:37:24.659
Oh. there's nothing
you can do about it.

769
00:37:24.784 --> 00:37:25.952
What. cancel it?

770
00:37:26.077 --> 00:37:27.871
I surrender. but never give up.

771
00:37:27.996 --> 00:37:29.539
and that surrendering. the fact

772
00:37:29.664 --> 00:37:31.124
that you're not in control is...

773
00:37:31.249 --> 00:37:33.585
It's critical
to being happy and content.

774
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:35.253
He's a go-getter. you know?

775
00:37:35.378 --> 00:37:38.548
You can't tell him "no."
and he'll be like "okay."

776
00:37:38.673 --> 00:37:41.468
He... you tell him "no."
he'll show you how it's done.

777
00:37:42.135 --> 00:37:44.262
All I can say
is that approaching problems

778
00:37:44.387 --> 00:37:46.765
with daylight is much easier

779
00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:49.058
than trying to contend
with them in the dark.

780
00:37:53.271 --> 00:37:55.815
Anyway. we're heading
south on our road.

781
00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:59.027
and it is a muddy mess.
but it is... it is stable.

782
00:37:59.152 --> 00:38:01.738
it's just... it's got
a lot of skim on it. so...

783
00:38:02.697 --> 00:38:04.115
It just gotta go slow and...

784
00:38:05.784 --> 00:38:07.410
Uh. take it easy.

785
00:38:07.535 --> 00:38:09.537
Then once we get past here.
we'll go down the road.

786
00:38:09.662 --> 00:38:12.123
you'll... it gets.
it's... it's all right.

787
00:38:12.248 --> 00:38:13.583
It's passable.

788
00:38:20.089 --> 00:38:21.758
The weather isn't gonna stop me.

789
00:38:21.883 --> 00:38:23.510
Like. nobody can control that.

790
00:38:23.635 --> 00:38:24.945
That's what they call
an "act of god." right there.

791
00:38:24.969 --> 00:38:26.137
You know what I mean?

792
00:38:29.933 --> 00:38:32.352
Well. I'll just
dump 'em some place else.

793
00:38:32.477 --> 00:38:33.677
What you're telling me. right?

794
00:38:37.106 --> 00:38:38.506
The more I watched Darren

795
00:38:38.608 --> 00:38:40.568
fight to see
this show through...

796
00:38:40.693 --> 00:38:43.321
My mind kept
bringing up the same question.

797
00:38:43.446 --> 00:38:46.699
"Why is this boomer
from Oklahoma so gung-ho

798
00:38:46.825 --> 00:38:49.035
to shell out millions
of dollars on a festival

799
00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:51.788
filled with music
he doesn't even listen to?"

800
00:38:51.913 --> 00:38:54.165
Yeah. are there people
waiting to get in?

801
00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:56.793
Ah. okay. All right.

802
00:38:56.918 --> 00:38:59.254
This question
was driving me crazy

803
00:38:59.379 --> 00:39:01.005
so I sat down
with the only person

804
00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:02.799
willing to give me
a straight answer.

805
00:39:03.967 --> 00:39:07.136
We actually had
a class together.

806
00:39:12.851 --> 00:39:14.769
I was a sophomore.

807
00:39:14.894 --> 00:39:18.565
He was a junior.
and we had speech and drama.

808
00:39:19.315 --> 00:39:20.650
And so we met.

809
00:39:22.151 --> 00:39:25.029
Darren's always
been really directed.

810
00:39:25.154 --> 00:39:28.366
He has a goal. he sets a goal.
and he gets to that goal.

811
00:39:29.701 --> 00:39:31.995
But now he's
much more mellow about it.

812
00:39:33.079 --> 00:39:34.664
I wanted a baby.

813
00:39:34.789 --> 00:39:36.457
so I was like.
"we could go somewhere.

814
00:39:36.583 --> 00:39:38.463
we could adopt one.
we could get a little girl."

815
00:39:38.501 --> 00:39:39.836
because we had three sons.

816
00:39:39.961 --> 00:39:41.641
and he was like
"uh. I don't..." You know.

817
00:39:41.754 --> 00:39:44.674
"I don't want to be
responsible for another life.

818
00:39:44.799 --> 00:39:45.925
I don't want to do it."

819
00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:47.302
And he was like. "get a dog.

820
00:39:47.427 --> 00:39:48.803
Go get that dog you want."

821
00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:53.266
So we got biscuit in 2003.

822
00:39:55.018 --> 00:39:56.227
Darren doesn't sit.

823
00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.855
Probably the hardest-working
person I know.

824
00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:01.858
but he always
has to be doing something.

825
00:40:01.983 --> 00:40:05.320
And with biscuit.
he could just sit.

826
00:40:06.821 --> 00:40:07.947
It was for me...

827
00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:12.118
But the dog did
so much more for Darren.

828
00:40:19.292 --> 00:40:22.211
He was getting older.
he was ten.

829
00:40:23.421 --> 00:40:25.798
He had really slowed down.

830
00:40:25.924 --> 00:40:29.469
But I hadn't really
noticed him being sick.

831
00:40:29.594 --> 00:40:31.930
Inoflced
that he slept a lot more.

832
00:40:34.849 --> 00:40:37.727
He was in bed with us.
and I kind of picked him up

833
00:40:37.852 --> 00:40:41.272
and brought him over to me.
and his belly was swollen.

834
00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:43.983
I was like. "what is up?"

835
00:40:44.108 --> 00:40:47.654
And then the next day.
he was super. super skinny.

836
00:40:48.738 --> 00:40:50.740
And so I took him
to the vet that day.

837
00:40:50.865 --> 00:40:54.327
and. um. she did an ultrasound.

838
00:40:54.452 --> 00:40:56.704
and she said.
"I just am not seeing

839
00:40:56.829 --> 00:40:59.040
even that much of a liver left.

840
00:40:59.165 --> 00:41:02.502
He probably. maybe
could live another 30 days

841
00:41:02.627 --> 00:41:05.004
to three months.
if we did a feeding tube."

842
00:41:05.838 --> 00:41:07.423
So I did that.

843
00:41:07.548 --> 00:41:10.176
Our daughter-in-law. Becca.
bless her heart. she was.

844
00:41:10.301 --> 00:41:13.846
you know. in the living room.
and I'm just boo-hooing.

845
00:41:13.972 --> 00:41:17.016
and she's texting Darren
and her husband. Jake.

846
00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:19.894
and it was like.
"biscuit's really. really sick.

847
00:41:20.019 --> 00:41:21.872
You get Linda's. you know.
beside herself. you can..."

848
00:41:21.896 --> 00:41:23.982
And I mean. Darren was just as...

849
00:41:24.107 --> 00:41:25.775
He was like.
"what do we have to do?"

850
00:41:27.527 --> 00:41:29.529
A day or so later.
I got to bring him home.

851
00:41:29.654 --> 00:41:32.407
and our whole
family was mourning

852
00:41:32.532 --> 00:41:34.784
this little 17-pound dog.

853
00:41:36.869 --> 00:41:39.330
Darren went out and found a spot

854
00:41:39.455 --> 00:41:41.958
where. you know.
we wanted him buried.

855
00:41:42.083 --> 00:41:45.086
and... so. you know.
he got that all fixed up.

856
00:41:45.211 --> 00:41:48.548
and he got built this
little rock bench out there.

857
00:41:56.347 --> 00:41:58.033
So that last day.
we were gonna have the vet

858
00:41:58.057 --> 00:42:00.685
come that day.
and he... he didn't need

859
00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:02.490
the vet. cause.
you know. we were all there

860
00:42:02.603 --> 00:42:04.665
in our... our bedroom.
and it was like. two of my sons

861
00:42:04.689 --> 00:42:06.458
were there and my wife and I.
and we... you know.

862
00:42:06.482 --> 00:42:08.402
he was just lying there
in our bed. and you know.

863
00:42:08.526 --> 00:42:11.571
he has that raspy
kind of sound that people make

864
00:42:11.696 --> 00:42:13.090
when they're
breathing as they're...

865
00:42:13.114 --> 00:42:14.657
As they're winding down.

866
00:42:14.782 --> 00:42:16.284
And we just
told him to. you know.

867
00:42:16.409 --> 00:42:19.996
to... to let go.
it... he was... he was okay.

868
00:42:21.539 --> 00:42:24.208
So anyway. he... he
passed away and we buried him.

869
00:42:32.216 --> 00:42:33.968
Biscuit was the catalyst.

870
00:42:34.093 --> 00:42:36.637
That's why I think
he wants to do the festivals.

871
00:42:49.317 --> 00:42:51.611
Biscuit thought
he was bigger than he was.

872
00:42:51.736 --> 00:42:54.113
He liked to chase butterflies.

873
00:42:54.947 --> 00:42:57.992
He would just go nuts
over a butterfly.

874
00:42:58.117 --> 00:42:59.827
and he would run.
and he would jump.

875
00:42:59.952 --> 00:43:02.955
and he would just
do this all the time.

876
00:43:03.081 --> 00:43:04.999
And so while he was dying.

877
00:43:05.124 --> 00:43:06.501
you know.
and I was loving on him

878
00:43:06.626 --> 00:43:08.186
and petting on him.
and you know. I say.

879
00:43:08.211 --> 00:43:09.962
you know.
"baby boy. you can just go.

880
00:43:10.088 --> 00:43:12.632
And then you can
chase all the butterflies...

881
00:43:14.092 --> 00:43:15.343
You want to chase."

882
00:43:16.219 --> 00:43:18.846
This. uh... it made me cry
and it will sound silly

883
00:43:18.971 --> 00:43:22.600
all at the same time.
but. um... so I told him.

884
00:43:22.725 --> 00:43:24.811
I said. "but let me know
that you're okay.

885
00:43:24.936 --> 00:43:28.523
Let me know that you're
chasing those butterflies."

886
00:43:28.648 --> 00:43:30.358
We Bury him.

887
00:43:30.483 --> 00:43:32.235
and I kind of
hang back a little bit.

888
00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.113
And this little white butterfly

889
00:43:35.238 --> 00:43:38.533
just started
flying all around me.

890
00:43:38.658 --> 00:43:40.868
This... this is
my dog telling me.

891
00:43:40.993 --> 00:43:42.954
"it's cool. I'm good.
Look. I'm happy. I'm free.

892
00:43:43.079 --> 00:43:44.372
I don't hurt anymore."

893
00:43:44.497 --> 00:43:45.998
And it stayed with me

894
00:43:46.124 --> 00:43:48.000
the whole time I was walking
back to the house.

895
00:43:48.126 --> 00:43:51.379
and I got
just past the tree line

896
00:43:51.504 --> 00:43:54.924
and it went back towards. um.

897
00:43:55.049 --> 00:43:56.134
where we had buried him.

898
00:43:56.259 --> 00:43:58.261
But after that.

899
00:43:58.386 --> 00:44:00.429
just about
every time I went out there.

900
00:44:00.555 --> 00:44:02.431
there would be
a white butterfly.

901
00:44:05.101 --> 00:44:08.604
Whether it's Darren's artwork.
or if you just see

902
00:44:08.729 --> 00:44:11.149
a little white butterfly
attached to something.

903
00:44:11.274 --> 00:44:13.460
well. you have butterflies
kind of scattered throughout.

904
00:44:13.484 --> 00:44:16.195
all of that
is tribute to biscuit.

905
00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:19.407
The hand statue. you know.
and some of this stuff

906
00:44:19.532 --> 00:44:23.369
is kind of evolved
with its own meanings as well.

907
00:44:23.494 --> 00:44:26.622
but the butterfly and the hand
was originally for biscuit.

908
00:44:30.293 --> 00:44:32.503
I don't think
he thought he could be

909
00:44:32.628 --> 00:44:36.090
that connected
to something that wasn't human.

910
00:44:36.215 --> 00:44:40.052
and biscuit let him...

911
00:44:40.761 --> 00:44:42.221
Let him experience that.

912
00:44:42.346 --> 00:44:44.432
Made him a better person.
made him a better father.

913
00:44:44.557 --> 00:44:46.142
made him a better husband.

914
00:44:46.267 --> 00:44:49.604
Saw that he could be
something other than this guy

915
00:44:49.729 --> 00:44:52.106
that his goal was to make money.

916
00:45:00.031 --> 00:45:02.783
There's a lot
to be taken from the hand.

917
00:45:02.909 --> 00:45:04.243
with the butterfly. you know.

918
00:45:04.368 --> 00:45:06.037
it... the...
The bottom of it. you know.

919
00:45:06.162 --> 00:45:08.706
there's the barbed wire
and all that. so the struggle

920
00:45:08.831 --> 00:45:11.375
and all of that.
and then the hand rising up.

921
00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:13.461
And the butterfly. and I think

922
00:45:13.586 --> 00:45:16.380
whether it was conscious
or whether it was unconscious.

923
00:45:16.505 --> 00:45:18.633
and he wanted biscuit
to be a part of it.

924
00:45:18.758 --> 00:45:20.593
I... the hand is opening up.

925
00:45:20.718 --> 00:45:22.511
and this butterfly is there.

926
00:45:22.637 --> 00:45:25.681
and so for me. symbolically.
sometimes I think.

927
00:45:25.806 --> 00:45:29.227
"that's Darren opening up.
and it's biscuit...

928
00:45:30.394 --> 00:45:33.105
That. you know.
brought him to that."

929
00:45:36.984 --> 00:45:39.987
The dog had
a profound impact on Darren

930
00:45:40.112 --> 00:45:43.866
that led to him wanting
for other people.

931
00:45:43.991 --> 00:45:45.409
I think. to feel...

932
00:45:46.244 --> 00:45:48.871
That connection with life.

933
00:45:48.996 --> 00:45:50.581
That... that living things.

934
00:45:50.706 --> 00:45:53.167
that we're all connected.
we're all in this together.

935
00:45:53.292 --> 00:45:54.585
We're... you know. we're one.

936
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:55.962
It helps you see the importance

937
00:45:56.087 --> 00:45:58.506
of relationships. and. you know.

938
00:45:58.631 --> 00:46:01.050
that hasn't always
been my main goal.

939
00:46:03.302 --> 00:46:04.553
Frankly. it wasn't.

940
00:46:04.679 --> 00:46:05.989
It was to succeed
and all that stuff.

941
00:46:06.013 --> 00:46:08.015
all those trappings
and when you see

942
00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:09.725
how really
unimportant they really are.

943
00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:12.228
that. you know. we're here
today and gone tomorrow.

944
00:46:12.895 --> 00:46:14.313
You... you never know. you know?

945
00:46:14.438 --> 00:46:16.399
You need to... you need
to live... live each day.

946
00:46:16.524 --> 00:46:18.317
because it's... it's gonna end.

947
00:46:18.442 --> 00:46:20.278
and that you gotta
find the joy in living.

948
00:46:35.584 --> 00:46:36.961
As bad as it got.

949
00:46:37.086 --> 00:46:39.171
it was just. like.
"okay. well. this is just

950
00:46:39.297 --> 00:46:40.649
something new
we have to deal with."

951
00:46:40.673 --> 00:46:43.259
You know. it's...
It's just another element

952
00:46:43.384 --> 00:46:45.636
in this show that we're...
We're gonna have to overcome.

953
00:46:45.761 --> 00:46:48.014
Because we've had
such a non-stop rain event.

954
00:46:48.139 --> 00:46:49.724
and it keeps going. that. uh...

955
00:46:49.849 --> 00:46:52.226
State fire marshal said
that we can't use the cryo

956
00:46:52.351 --> 00:46:54.520
or the pyro for now.
until it dries up.

957
00:46:54.645 --> 00:46:56.480
So that's... that's one thing.

958
00:46:56.605 --> 00:46:59.984
The other thing is the lights.
because on the mainstage or so.

959
00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:01.420
uh. the... you know.
they're kind of subject

960
00:47:01.444 --> 00:47:02.796
to the elements.
I can't really keep

961
00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:04.739
the... the water out of it. uh.

962
00:47:04.864 --> 00:47:06.657
they can't be turned on
or else they'll fry.

963
00:47:06.782 --> 00:47:08.576
So we're gonna have to go
heavier on lasers.

964
00:47:08.701 --> 00:47:10.286
and do some
waterproof lights. so...

965
00:47:10.411 --> 00:47:12.131
It's not gonna
necessarily be up completely.

966
00:47:12.163 --> 00:47:14.290
the standards everybody
wanted to do for today.

967
00:47:14.415 --> 00:47:16.834
but you know.
uh. that's on the mainstage.

968
00:47:16.959 --> 00:47:18.627
Pyramid stage. uh. third stage

969
00:47:18.753 --> 00:47:20.546
and second stage
are all good to go fine.

970
00:47:20.671 --> 00:47:22.798
I felt like it would work.
and then it wouldn't.

971
00:47:22.923 --> 00:47:24.342
then it would work.
and it wouldn't.

972
00:47:24.467 --> 00:47:26.385
The... the loads
that I'm getting next.

973
00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:27.803
Tony doesn't want 'em.

974
00:47:27.928 --> 00:47:29.305
He's gonna keep
his trucks running.

975
00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:31.015
so he'll keep
coming out there with you.

976
00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:32.701
And I'm just gonna take...
Go up to there in a minute.

977
00:47:32.725 --> 00:47:34.643
and then we'll dump.
uh. when they get here.

978
00:47:34.769 --> 00:47:36.538
And you tell me where to...
Where to go with them.

979
00:47:36.562 --> 00:47:38.105
- Cool.
- All right. thank you.

980
00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:42.443
J“ I guess you're just broken j“

981
00:47:42.568 --> 00:47:46.655
j“ I guess
you're just hopin' for more j“

982
00:47:48.783 --> 00:47:53.245
j“ I guess
you're just reachin' j“

983
00:47:53.371 --> 00:47:57.583
j“ I guess
you're just in need of love j“

984
00:47:59.043 --> 00:48:01.670
j“ but you're not alone j“

985
00:48:02.671 --> 00:48:06.217
j“ you're not alone j“

986
00:48:07.218 --> 00:48:08.886
j“ in this j“

987
00:48:15.768 --> 00:48:19.146
J“ I guess I'm just broken j“

988
00:48:19.271 --> 00:48:21.440
ten minutes!
And we'll have some more rock.

989
00:48:21.565 --> 00:48:24.944
J“ I guess
I'm just hopin' for more j“

990
00:48:27.321 --> 00:48:28.864
where do I want to put the rock?

991
00:48:28.989 --> 00:48:30.634
You want the rock
to just keep coming up here?

992
00:48:30.658 --> 00:48:32.243
Well. we're gonna... okay.

993
00:48:32.368 --> 00:48:34.870
Invested a lot of money
in infrastructure. which...

994
00:48:34.995 --> 00:48:36.640
You know. you weren't gonna
get that back. but...

995
00:48:36.664 --> 00:48:38.541
You know. operationally.
you wanted to try

996
00:48:38.666 --> 00:48:41.061
to get close to breaking even.
or not be too far in the hole.

997
00:48:41.085 --> 00:48:43.754
I mean. this is a tremendous...
It was a big hole.

998
00:48:43.879 --> 00:48:45.399
You just want it in here. then?

999
00:48:45.423 --> 00:48:46.590
All the way over there?

1000
00:48:52.012 --> 00:48:54.682
J“ I'm not alone j“

1001
00:48:55.516 --> 00:48:57.935
j“ I'm not alone

1002
00:48:59.937 --> 00:49:01.063
j“ in this j“

1003
00:49:01.689 --> 00:49:03.566
so once it's wet.
it's wet. right?

1004
00:49:03.691 --> 00:49:05.411
- Just deal with it. it's...
- That's right.

1005
00:49:05.443 --> 00:49:07.363
We'll have more people
to deal with here shortly.

1006
00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:11.907
J“ I guess I'm just broken j“

1007
00:49:13.242 --> 00:49:17.455
j“ I guess
I'm just hopin' for more j“

1008
00:49:18.414 --> 00:49:19.975
the performers.
that they will. like. bail.

1009
00:49:19.999 --> 00:49:21.476
or they'll say
it's too wet. or whatever.

1010
00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:22.900
or is that
not even really an issue?

1011
00:49:24.253 --> 00:49:28.632
J“ I guess
I'm just in need of love j“

1012
00:49:30.217 --> 00:49:32.094
j“ I'm not alone j“

1013
00:49:32.219 --> 00:49:33.762
we saw no one all day.

1014
00:49:33.888 --> 00:49:35.598
the people were
in their tents all day.

1015
00:49:35.723 --> 00:49:37.433
and... and I can remember

1016
00:49:37.558 --> 00:49:39.238
having the conversation
with the gentlemen.

1017
00:49:39.268 --> 00:49:40.828
and I was. like.
"here in a little bit."

1018
00:49:41.479 --> 00:49:42.897
Whenever it gets bright lights.

1019
00:49:43.022 --> 00:49:44.398
and lasers start going off.

1020
00:49:44.523 --> 00:49:45.816
and pyro starts going off.

1021
00:49:45.941 --> 00:49:47.067
people are gonna be dancing

1022
00:49:47.193 --> 00:49:48.444
in this knee-deep water.

1023
00:49:51.572 --> 00:49:53.572
Y'all plan that weather?
Did you book that weather?

1024
00:49:54.116 --> 00:49:55.927
Luckily. my shoes
are the same color as the mud.

1025
00:49:55.951 --> 00:49:58.204
so. the weather didn't stop me.

1026
00:49:58.329 --> 00:50:00.515
You see nothing when you come
through the gate up there.

1027
00:50:00.539 --> 00:50:02.666
But on top of the hill
it was. uh...

1028
00:50:02.791 --> 00:50:04.877
You seen all the tents.
and. you know. all the people

1029
00:50:05.002 --> 00:50:07.129
and. uh. it was overwhelming.

1030
00:50:07.254 --> 00:50:10.174
how many people were here
in the middle of the storm.

1031
00:50:10.299 --> 00:50:11.675
It's raining.

1032
00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:13.719
You got staff frantic.
running around

1033
00:50:13.844 --> 00:50:15.513
trying to figure
everything out. you know?

1034
00:50:15.638 --> 00:50:17.014
Stage sound cuts out.

1035
00:50:17.139 --> 00:50:18.575
They're going out.
they're fixing it.

1036
00:50:18.599 --> 00:50:20.309
It's not...
There's no hesitation.

1037
00:50:20.434 --> 00:50:22.436
they're just on top of it.
the whole time.

1038
00:50:22.561 --> 00:50:24.271
They're figuring out
what the problem is

1039
00:50:24.396 --> 00:50:25.564
and they're fixing it.

1040
00:50:25.689 --> 00:50:27.024
Well. putting out fires.
you know.

1041
00:50:27.149 --> 00:50:28.469
trying to get
the road stabilized.

1042
00:50:28.526 --> 00:50:30.027
trying to get people unstuck.

1043
00:50:30.152 --> 00:50:31.463
And you know. there's
always a thousand things

1044
00:50:31.487 --> 00:50:32.905
that can be done.
need to be done.

1045
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:35.115
And... uh. I did wander around

1046
00:50:35.241 --> 00:50:37.493
and... uh. uh.
I had a good experience

1047
00:50:37.618 --> 00:50:39.203
in the... in the other barn.

1048
00:50:39.328 --> 00:50:41.288
when we had
some of the artists in there

1049
00:50:41.413 --> 00:50:43.475
with their lights. and the...
Their music going inside.

1050
00:50:43.499 --> 00:50:45.143
And I thought
that was a special time. too.

1051
00:50:45.167 --> 00:50:47.461
I... it was really
something I really enjoyed.

1052
00:51:22.705 --> 00:51:24.623
The feeling
of walking around and seeing

1053
00:51:24.748 --> 00:51:26.834
the whole thing put together
was... was amazing.

1054
00:51:26.959 --> 00:51:28.544
I love this place.

1055
00:51:28.669 --> 00:51:30.605
I've never played on a stage
that big. regardless.

1056
00:51:30.629 --> 00:51:32.756
but I'm honored to be here
and I'm not expecting

1057
00:51:32.881 --> 00:51:34.441
anything other
than to have a good time.

1058
00:51:43.851 --> 00:51:46.562
It's not always fun
to work in the rain.

1059
00:51:46.687 --> 00:51:49.565
but sometimes you have to do
what you don't want to do.

1060
00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:51.334
It was good to see people
that were willing

1061
00:51:51.358 --> 00:51:53.038
to still be out there
enjoying their music.

1062
00:52:00.242 --> 00:52:01.702
We all have
dull parts of our life.

1063
00:52:01.827 --> 00:52:03.587
you know. work
that we have to do every week.

1064
00:52:03.662 --> 00:52:05.873
But it's always nice to have
something that's important.

1065
00:52:05.998 --> 00:52:08.208
that's outside
of our normal context.

1066
00:52:08.334 --> 00:52:12.796
that allows you to pull that
familiar person that you are.

1067
00:52:12.921 --> 00:52:15.049
put that... that outer skin off.
and. you know.

1068
00:52:15.174 --> 00:52:16.985
kind of try to be
something a little different.

1069
00:52:17.009 --> 00:52:18.689
Or... or... it's not...
That's not correct.

1070
00:52:18.802 --> 00:52:20.220
It's not you trying
to be different.

1071
00:52:20.346 --> 00:52:21.866
it's just you trying
to be who you are.

1072
00:52:31.315 --> 00:52:33.567
They were dancing
in water knee-deep.

1073
00:52:33.692 --> 00:52:35.361
and going hard at it.

1074
00:52:35.486 --> 00:52:38.781
and enjoying the time
and they were ready to rock.

1075
00:52:39.531 --> 00:52:40.658
They'd been cooped up.

1076
00:52:54.421 --> 00:52:57.591
I don't think I looked
in one spot in that field

1077
00:52:57.716 --> 00:52:59.259
that was covered
in knee-deep water

1078
00:52:59.385 --> 00:53:00.886
that people
weren'tjumping around.

1079
00:53:01.011 --> 00:53:03.305
and mud wasn't flying
six foot in the air.

1080
00:53:06.433 --> 00:53:08.102
Whenever I'd be able
to find the time.

1081
00:53:08.227 --> 00:53:09.827
I'd turn around
and look at the audience.

1082
00:53:09.895 --> 00:53:11.456
That's really the one
that you're here for.

1083
00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:12.648
To make them happy.

1084
00:53:28.414 --> 00:53:29.808
The weather ain't
stopping me. come on.

1085
00:53:29.832 --> 00:53:32.584
Some rain? I didn't shower.

1086
00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:33.794
Chilled in the rain.

1087
00:53:40.509 --> 00:53:43.262
It's like people were
picking up mud and flinging it.

1088
00:53:43.387 --> 00:53:45.222
but it was just them
jumping up and down.

1089
00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:56.900
The people out there.
those are the real legends.

1090
00:54:21.216 --> 00:54:22.926
I thought
we were gonna see an exodus.

1091
00:54:23.051 --> 00:54:24.428
but it wasn't.

1092
00:54:24.553 --> 00:54:28.182
You know. the bizarre
devotion to. uh...

1093
00:54:29.057 --> 00:54:30.851
Staying and... what.
seeing the show

1094
00:54:30.976 --> 00:54:32.269
was overwhelming to us.

1095
00:54:35.731 --> 00:54:38.942
People were staying for sure.

1096
00:54:44.406 --> 00:54:46.450
But we had the hope that.
you know.

1097
00:54:46.575 --> 00:54:47.910
at least for the last day.

1098
00:54:48.035 --> 00:54:49.675
that... that maybe
the sun would come out.

1099
00:55:03.258 --> 00:55:06.053
So it was Saturday
when it finally broke apart.

1100
00:55:06.178 --> 00:55:08.222
the storms.
and allowed us to do a show.

1101
00:55:12.684 --> 00:55:14.829
That was. like.
the saving grace of everything.

1102
00:55:14.853 --> 00:55:17.213
You go through all the rain.
the whole time we've been here.

1103
00:55:17.314 --> 00:55:20.692
and then. sure enough.
Saturday shows up. clear skies.

1104
00:55:20.818 --> 00:55:21.860
Sunny

1105
00:55:25.656 --> 00:55:27.157
now that they experienced that.

1106
00:55:27.282 --> 00:55:29.368
it's just gonna be
a whole different vibe.

1107
00:55:30.369 --> 00:55:33.080
People are gonna be out in it.
getting crazy... you know.

1108
00:55:33.205 --> 00:55:35.541
they don't care about the mud
anymore. it's just sunny.

1109
00:55:35.666 --> 00:55:36.986
Everyone's gonna
have a good time.

1110
00:55:51.515 --> 00:55:54.893
Despite adversity.
humanity goes on. people go on.

1111
00:55:55.018 --> 00:55:56.687
but the human spirit survives

1112
00:55:56.812 --> 00:55:58.814
and it overcomes everything
it needs to overcome.

1113
00:55:58.939 --> 00:56:00.107
and we go on.

1114
00:56:17.165 --> 00:56:18.584
The artists
loved the experience.

1115
00:56:18.709 --> 00:56:20.127
for the most part.

1116
00:56:20.252 --> 00:56:22.296
They like the eclectic
nature of the buildings.

1117
00:56:22.421 --> 00:56:24.131
and how they were treated.

1118
00:56:24.256 --> 00:56:25.924
And we want to treat them right.

1119
00:56:26.049 --> 00:56:27.819
We want to treat them
like we want to be treated.

1120
00:56:27.843 --> 00:56:29.386
and I think
they appreciated that.

1121
00:56:29.511 --> 00:56:31.072
But we don't want to...
We don't... we don't...

1122
00:56:31.096 --> 00:56:32.681
I... they're...
They're not idols to us.

1123
00:56:33.307 --> 00:56:35.017
We try to treat
our guests the same way.

1124
00:56:35.142 --> 00:56:37.936
our vip. whatever... whatever
group is we're talking about

1125
00:56:38.061 --> 00:56:39.479
needs to be
treated respectfully.

1126
00:56:39.605 --> 00:56:41.106
Best part about the festival...

1127
00:56:41.857 --> 00:56:44.860
I would say.
is how hospitable they are.

1128
00:56:44.985 --> 00:56:47.821
They are so accommodating
to everyone. Everyone.

1129
00:56:47.946 --> 00:56:51.283
Artists. staff.
people that are actually here.

1130
00:56:51.408 --> 00:56:53.660
you know. the consumers.
the people that come.

1131
00:56:53.785 --> 00:56:55.913
miles away. fly here. you know.

1132
00:56:56.038 --> 00:56:58.141
They came here. it's raining.
Like. how would that feel?

1133
00:56:58.165 --> 00:56:59.875
"I spent a hundred.
two hundred bucks

1134
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.120
to get into this festival
and it's raining." you know?

1135
00:57:02.169 --> 00:57:03.563
And they're still out there.
like I said.

1136
00:57:03.587 --> 00:57:04.689
they're still out there.
fixing it.

1137
00:57:04.713 --> 00:57:06.089
doing everything they can

1138
00:57:06.214 --> 00:57:07.614
to make it a good time
for everyone.

1139
00:57:07.674 --> 00:57:09.009
And I think
that's the best thing.

1140
00:57:09.134 --> 00:57:10.344
is that they care so much.

1141
00:57:23.732 --> 00:57:25.492
The hospitality.
Everyone here cares.

1142
00:57:25.609 --> 00:57:27.378
Everyone's working so hard.
They're actually on top of it.

1143
00:57:27.402 --> 00:57:30.197
They don't care that there's
not 7000 people out there.

1144
00:57:30.322 --> 00:57:31.406
you know what I mean?

1145
00:57:31.531 --> 00:57:32.908
Like. I've played
festivals before

1146
00:57:33.033 --> 00:57:34.427
where I didn't get
a meal ticket because

1147
00:57:34.451 --> 00:57:35.851
I'm not playing
mainstage. you know?

1148
00:57:35.911 --> 00:57:37.287
And here. they...
They're straight

1149
00:57:37.412 --> 00:57:39.581
taking care of me.
like. hardcore.

1150
00:57:39.706 --> 00:57:41.792
80... and not just me. everyone.

1151
00:57:41.917 --> 00:57:43.710
And. like.
everyone from the staff.

1152
00:57:43.835 --> 00:57:46.463
to the stage.
to the sound. to the location.

1153
00:57:47.214 --> 00:57:48.924
Everything is ten out of ten.

1154
00:57:53.136 --> 00:57:55.097
If you've never been
to a music festival.

1155
00:57:55.222 --> 00:57:59.017
you're missing one of the most
impactful moments of your life.

1156
00:57:59.142 --> 00:58:01.186
There's so much
opportunity out there.

1157
00:58:01.311 --> 00:58:02.604
more than
just hearing the music.

1158
00:58:02.729 --> 00:58:04.314
It's... it's building
the camaraderie.

1159
00:58:04.439 --> 00:58:06.775
It's seeing things
you normally wouldn't see.

1160
00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:09.569
and it's... it's a feeling
of gratification inside.

1161
00:58:09.695 --> 00:58:11.697
of doing something
that is just...

1162
00:58:11.822 --> 00:58:12.990
It's phenomenal.

1163
00:58:13.699 --> 00:58:14.783
It's life-changing.

1164
00:58:20.372 --> 00:58:24.668
Darren's persistence
on basically every Avenue

1165
00:58:24.793 --> 00:58:26.294
is the reason
why it worked. you know.

1166
00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:27.754
He pushed us to the limits

1167
00:58:27.879 --> 00:58:29.359
to make sure
that it was gonna happen.

1168
00:58:47.774 --> 00:58:49.836
I think the... overall.
the success of the festival.

1169
00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:52.279
it... you know. financially.
it's not gonna be a success.

1170
00:58:52.404 --> 00:58:54.865
but ultimately. financially.
I think it will work out.

1171
00:58:54.990 --> 00:58:57.451
because it lays the groundwork
for the next steps.

1172
00:58:57.576 --> 00:59:00.370
And you have to go
through that process

1173
00:59:00.495 --> 00:59:02.622
to get credibility
to go to the next step.

1174
00:59:04.583 --> 00:59:06.418
Ekali finished his set.

1175
00:59:06.543 --> 00:59:08.086
The crowd grew silent

1176
00:59:08.211 --> 00:59:09.771
as we stood in the mud
at the mainstage.

1177
00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:11.381
And I started thinking...

1178
00:59:11.506 --> 00:59:13.550
Darren built Bridges
for a living.

1179
00:59:13.675 --> 00:59:15.927
allowing people to get
from one place to another.

1180
00:59:16.762 --> 00:59:18.638
And the last few days.

1181
00:59:18.764 --> 00:59:20.223
I think he provided a way for us

1182
00:59:20.348 --> 00:59:21.628
to get to where we needed to be.

1183
00:59:27.272 --> 00:59:28.315
Together.

1184
01:00:20.659 --> 01:00:22.410
So the show must go on.

1185
01:00:22.536 --> 01:00:24.764
It's a term you hear. day in
and day out. in our industry.

1186
01:00:24.788 --> 01:00:26.588
Everyone kind of
showed up and made it happen.

1187
01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:35.090
It's the end of the world.

1188
01:00:35.215 --> 01:00:37.401
and everything is kind of
falling apart around it. and...

1189
01:00:37.425 --> 01:00:39.305
You kind of push through it.
and make it happen.

1190
01:01:03.118 --> 01:01:04.703
It's always frustrating.

1191
01:01:04.828 --> 01:01:06.597
but you can't allow it
to get the best of you.

1192
01:01:06.621 --> 01:01:08.874
You just have to figure it out
and keep moving forward.

1193
01:01:12.711 --> 01:01:14.296
Oh. it was overwhelming.

1194
01:01:14.421 --> 01:01:16.256
The turnout. With the weather.

1195
01:01:16.381 --> 01:01:17.841
Just can't imagine

1196
01:01:17.966 --> 01:01:20.844
many other venues
that would have stayed.

1197
01:01:27.058 --> 01:01:28.435
It was awesome.

1198
01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:29.895
Seeing 2000 people there.

1199
01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:31.479
just having
the time of their lives.

1200
01:01:31.605 --> 01:01:34.024
despite the worst
possible conditions.

1201
01:01:34.149 --> 01:01:35.734
It's what gives you life.

1202
01:01:40.697 --> 01:01:42.133
For the most part.
I think everything was perfect.

1203
01:01:42.157 --> 01:01:43.491
I think it was a great venue.

1204
01:01:43.617 --> 01:01:45.410
and I think
a lot of people were happy

1205
01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:46.912
with the way
the venue turned out.

1206
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:06.264
I think the biggest
thing was having

1207
01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:10.894
the owner of the property
and investor being so involved.

1208
01:02:11.019 --> 01:02:12.520
being all hands on deck

1209
01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:14.231
whenever he was
asked and needed.

1210
01:02:14.356 --> 01:02:15.815
or even whenever he wasn't.

1211
01:02:15.941 --> 01:02:18.026
I mean. the guy worked
night and day months.

1212
01:02:18.151 --> 01:02:20.195
preparing for just those
three days that we had

1213
01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:21.446
out at his property.

1214
01:02:33.667 --> 01:02:36.836
Darren wasn't gonna
allow the show not to happen.

1215
01:02:36.962 --> 01:02:38.356
You know.
Darren's the whole reason

1216
01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:39.547
that that still happened.

1217
01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:41.940
On that Sunday. when I drive up.

1218
01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:44.010
it wasn't any big deal.
but the people were happy.

1219
01:02:44.135 --> 01:02:45.553
But they weren't complaining.

1220
01:02:45.679 --> 01:02:47.180
and we were all in it together.

1221
01:02:47.305 --> 01:02:48.905
And they saw
that we were in it together.

1222
01:02:48.974 --> 01:02:50.534
because they saw
that we were trying to do

1223
01:02:50.558 --> 01:02:53.103
what we could to... to try
to get them in there.

1224
01:03:03.947 --> 01:03:07.200
Live music
in a festival scene is amazing.

1225
01:03:07.325 --> 01:03:09.786
And it... it'll change you.
It really will.

1226
01:03:09.911 --> 01:03:12.289
You make connections.
lifelong connections.

1227
01:03:12.414 --> 01:03:14.165
There's people
that I worked with.

1228
01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:16.459
that are now
lifelong friends. because

1229
01:03:16.584 --> 01:03:19.296
a music festival allowed us
to... to cross paths.

1230
01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:24.509
Building
the relationships with people.

1231
01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:26.074
that's what I was
most excited about.

1232
01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:30.650
We essentially
gave a free concert.

1233
01:03:31.433 --> 01:03:33.768
If I'd charged them what
it costs. maybe... you know.

1234
01:03:33.893 --> 01:03:35.613
we probably wouldn't
have sold many tickets.

1235
01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:40.084
I'm really
just excited for the future.

1236
01:03:40.108 --> 01:03:42.027
I think that
we've got something here.

1237
01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:47.365
We all have struggles in life.

1238
01:03:48.033 --> 01:03:52.078
It can be the end all. be all.
or you can overcome adversity.

1239
01:03:52.203 --> 01:03:54.622
You can take the struggle
that you're having

1240
01:03:54.748 --> 01:03:56.458
and figure out
a solution for it.

1241
01:03:56.583 --> 01:03:58.710
and run with it
and get a lesson out of life.

1242
01:03:59.252 --> 01:04:01.046
It makes us who we are.

1243
01:04:01.171 --> 01:04:03.298
It's what defines our character.

1244
01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:21.261
We are much easier
to conquer when we're divided.

1245
01:04:22.233 --> 01:04:23.860
You can have
a much better society

1246
01:04:23.985 --> 01:04:25.737
with just a pledge
to try to get along.

1247
01:04:25.862 --> 01:04:27.947
and not have wars
and try to be fair-minded.

1248
01:04:30.617 --> 01:04:32.285
We learn a lot more
from our failures

1249
01:04:32.410 --> 01:04:33.995
than we do from our successes.

1250
01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.498
We just gotta let go
of our egos and quitjudging.

1251
01:04:37.665 --> 01:04:39.834
We judge everybody so harshly.

1252
01:04:41.753 --> 01:04:43.004
Don't prevent me from dancing

1253
01:04:43.129 --> 01:04:44.672
because
you can't hear the music.

1254
01:04:45.382 --> 01:04:47.217
I think
there's a lot of truth to that.

1255
01:04:47.342 --> 01:04:49.260
A lot of us are actually
dancing to the music.

1256
01:04:49.386 --> 01:04:51.221
and the other people
can't hear it.

1257
01:04:57.394 --> 01:05:00.814
As they worked together.
under horrible circumstances...

1258
01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:03.942
It was nine inches of rain

1259
01:05:04.067 --> 01:05:06.069
and the Sandy soil.

1260
01:05:09.656 --> 01:05:11.741
That. to him. I think.

1261
01:05:11.866 --> 01:05:15.954
solidified what he's thinking.

1262
01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:19.290
trying to get people
to listen to one another.

1263
01:05:27.382 --> 01:05:29.342
When people sacrifice together.

1264
01:05:29.467 --> 01:05:30.844
for whatever the cause is.

1265
01:05:30.969 --> 01:05:32.637
I mean...
It's easier to get things done.

1266
01:05:33.555 --> 01:05:36.307
The hardship.
the struggle and the suffering

1267
01:05:36.433 --> 01:05:38.309
actually makes
the experience grander.

1268
01:05:43.898 --> 01:05:45.984
We have to resolve
the spiritual crisis.

1269
01:05:46.693 --> 01:05:48.236
Whether we want
to call it that or not.

1270
01:05:48.361 --> 01:05:50.121
because it... who are
we and why are we here?

1271
01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:06.754
It's been
over a year since daybreak.

1272
01:06:09.507 --> 01:06:12.218
We've had to weather
a lot of storms since then.

1273
01:06:12.927 --> 01:06:15.054
With COVID-19...

1274
01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:18.641
Riots and the nation
fighting for political power.

1275
01:06:22.103 --> 01:06:24.147
I take hope. though.
when I think about daybreak.

1276
01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:28.401
Watching people charge
into the storm in the mud

1277
01:06:28.526 --> 01:06:29.777
to take care of each other.

1278
01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:34.073
I like to believe
there was a force of life

1279
01:06:34.199 --> 01:06:35.283
behind that event.

1280
01:06:39.787 --> 01:06:41.080
A small dog dies.

1281
01:06:43.541 --> 01:06:44.918
A little farmer's enlightened.

1282
01:06:47.879 --> 01:06:49.756
And 2000 people
at daybreak learn

1283
01:06:49.881 --> 01:06:51.508
what it means to be human.

1284
01:06:53.676 --> 01:06:55.637
It really puts things
into perspective.

1285
01:06:56.971 --> 01:06:58.348
How a little
consideration and love

1286
01:06:58.473 --> 01:06:59.974
make a huge difference.

1287
01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:02.977
Darren knows that.

1288
01:07:06.564 --> 01:07:08.441
And that's why
he's dedicated his ranch

1289
01:07:08.566 --> 01:07:10.693
to creating events
that bring people together.

1290
01:07:14.822 --> 01:07:17.075
Darren...

1291
01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:20.036
Well. he's fighting
for a better tomorrow.

1292
01:07:23.456 --> 01:07:24.749
He's fighting for the daybreak.

1293
01:07:28.294 --> 01:07:32.257
J“ daybreak's in a single man j“

1294
01:07:32.382 --> 01:07:35.969
j“ with one hammer
and two hands j“

1295
01:07:36.094 --> 01:07:39.097
j“ he begins
with a nail and plank j“

1296
01:07:39.222 --> 01:07:42.183
j“ steel pushing
through the wood grain j“

1297
01:07:42.308 --> 01:07:45.937
j“ all the racket he makes
from his one-man crew j“

1298
01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:49.774
j“ that draws another man
seeking to build. too j“

1299
01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:53.861
j“ now with four strong arms
and one desire j“

1300
01:07:53.987 --> 01:07:56.656
j“ now it's moving along
in double time j“

1301
01:07:56.781 --> 01:08:02.078
j“ hey brother. it's time
to put your hands on j“

1302
01:08:02.203 --> 01:08:05.957
j“ cause we 're building
a stage to stand on j“

1303
01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:09.460
j“ oh. we're building
a stage to stand on j“

1304
01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:13.965
j“ getting taller and taller j“

1305
01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:16.843
j“ from the ground
it began on j“

1306
01:08:16.968 --> 01:08:20.638
j“ and we're building
a stage to stand on j“

1307
01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:24.309
j“ oh. we're building
a stage to stand on j“

1308
01:08:25.685 --> 01:08:28.187
j“ when the day breaks again j“

1309
01:08:29.606 --> 01:08:33.234
j“ the two men return
to where they've been j“

1310
01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:37.488
j“ to see
the crowd of people gathered j“

1311
01:08:37.614 --> 01:08:41.326
j“ with their saws
ropes and ladders j“

1312
01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:44.871
j“ the cast of workers
hoist and heave j“

1313
01:08:44.996 --> 01:08:47.665
j“ and their labor sounds
much like a symphony j“

1314
01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:52.128
j“ so many hands and heads
composing it j“

1315
01:08:52.253 --> 01:08:55.506
j“ the last dance closer.
closing in j“

1316
01:08:55.632 --> 01:09:00.762
j“ hey brother. it's time
to put your hands on j“

1317
01:09:00.887 --> 01:09:04.474
j“ cause we 're building
a stage to stand on j“

1318
01:09:04.599 --> 01:09:08.102
j“ oh. we're building
a stage to stand on j“

1319
01:09:09.228 --> 01:09:12.690
j“ getting taller and taller j“

1320
01:09:12.815 --> 01:09:15.568
j“ from the ground
it began on j“

1321
01:09:15.693 --> 01:09:19.238
j“ and we're building
a stage to stand on j“

1322
01:09:19.364 --> 01:09:23.076
j“ oh. we 're a building
a stage to stand on j“

1323
01:09:30.333 --> 01:09:33.961
J“ and we're building
a stage to stand on j“

1324
01:09:39.217 --> 01:09:41.636
J“ and it happens j“

1325
01:09:42.804 --> 01:09:44.972
j“ the pounding ceases j“

1326
01:09:46.557 --> 01:09:49.852
j“ and on the land
the structure stands j“

1327
01:09:49.977 --> 01:09:52.605
j“ made from
thousands of pieces j“

1328
01:09:53.856 --> 01:09:56.359
j“ illuminated j“

1329
01:09:57.193 --> 01:09:59.404
j“ standing strong j“

1330
01:10:01.072 --> 01:10:04.075
j“ the stage is finished now j“

1331
01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:07.412
j“ built for all to stand on j“

1332
01:10:08.955 --> 01:10:11.916
j“ whoo j“

1333
01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:15.169
j“ whoo j“

1334
01:10:16.087 --> 01:10:19.173
j“ whoo j“
