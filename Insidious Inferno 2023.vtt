bleeding all over the place.

you grab me a towel. please?

was my Lustau Amontillado.

kill me. Fortunato.

the one being killed.

27
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.787
but I do appreciate
your joke all the same.

28
00:02:12.925 --> 00:02:15.790
- I am sorry.
- Stop. stop. Don't touch it.

29

I don't need
you cutting yourself

any more than
you already have. okay?

31
00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:22.728
So let's see. go sit down.
and I'll take care of this.

32
00:02:32.945 --> 00:02:36.017
You know. I really hope
you don't need stitches.

33
00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:40.712
- Yeah. me neither.
- A little piece of advice.

Next time you almost black out.

35
00:02:42.714 --> 00:02:46.166
don't step forward onto the
glass that you just dropped.

36
00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.720
- That's good advice.

37
00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:55.623
This wasn't like a normal
blackout.
though. It was strange.

38
00:02:55.761 --> 00:02:59.317
- Because there is such a
thing as a normal blackout?

39
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.459
Strange how?

40
00:03:11.881 --> 00:03:13.365
- It was like...

41
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.060
It was like. you know.
like when a bright light

42
00:03:19.992 --> 00:03:22.098
shines in your face. but
your eyes are closed.

43
00:03:22.236 --> 00:03:25.412
and it's just that bright red.

44
00:03:26.516 --> 00:03:28.760
- Probably because
your eyes were closed

45
00:03:28.898 --> 00:03:31.866
while you stepped forward
into a pile of broken glass.

46
00:03:34.697 --> 00:03:38.218
- Did you pack your stuff?
- No. not all of it.

47

- Honey!
- What?

48
00:03:40.565 --> 00:03:41.807
I mean. what do
you want from me?

49
00:03:41.945 --> 00:03:44.189
- I want you to be
ready to leave tomorrow.

50
00:03:44.327 --> 00:03:45.708
- [Andre] I am.

51
00:03:45.846 --> 00:03:47.227
- I don't want you to be
complaining the whole time

52
00:03:47.365 --> 00:03:49.194
about how
you didn't bring enough socks.

53
00:03:49.332 --> 00:03:51.438
- Okay. first off. I won't.

54
00:03:53.302 --> 00:03:54.786
- I just want to
get this over with.

55
00:03:54.924 --> 00:03:57.409
I just want to get in. sign
off on the inspections.

56
00:03:57.547 --> 00:03:59.446
and then get back home.

57
00:03:59.584 --> 00:04:01.310
- We will. All right.

58
00:04:04.761 --> 00:04:08.317
I promise. Trust me. I
know you're dreading this.

59
00:04:08.455 --> 00:04:10.526
I've been living
with you. all right.

60
00:04:10.664 --> 00:04:12.010
but we're going
to get out there.

61
00:04:12.148 --> 00:04:13.874
We're going to throw
away all that old shit.

62
00:04:14.012 --> 00:04:16.048
We're going to fix the
shingles. all right.

63
00:04:16.186 --> 00:04:18.810
then we're going to flip that
house for a cool 300 grand.

64
00:04:18.948 --> 00:04:22.848
Easy in. easy out.
Week. tops. all right?

65
00:04:22.986 --> 00:04:25.161
Then you don't have to think
of any of those bad memories

66
00:04:25.299 --> 00:04:27.059
ever again if you don't want to.

67
00:04:27.197 --> 00:04:29.130
- Promise?
- Hell yeah I do.

68
00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:32.996
I mean. purge that shit and
then shove it way back deep.

69
00:04:33.134 --> 00:04:34.032
Worked for me.

70
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.448
- If you are being sarcastic.

71
00:04:36.586 --> 00:04:38.416
I am not much
for sarcasm right now.

72
00:04:38.554 --> 00:04:40.487
- Listen. duty calls. all right?

73
00:04:40.625 --> 00:04:42.420
I'll be home in a few hours.

74
00:04:42.558 --> 00:04:44.801
- Okay.
- All right. I love you.

[ominous music continues]

78
00:05:14.831 --> 00:05:17.627
- If I had one wish. it
would be that none of you

79
00:05:17.765 --> 00:05:20.112
ever have to go through
what I went through.

80
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.909
It breaks my heart at the
thought of your parents.

81
00:05:25.186 --> 00:05:30.053
your daughter. your loved
ones. getting a call

82
00:05:30.191 --> 00:05:32.953
that you were killed in
a drunk driving accident.

83
00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:36.681
It's probably the worst
news anyone can ever get.

84
00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:39.925
and it tears
families apart. all right?

85
00:05:40.063 --> 00:05:41.513
It tore my family apart.

00:05:42.928 --> 00:05:46.449
After we got
the news of Lenora's death.

87
00:05:46.587 --> 00:05:49.141
my ex-wife
spiraled into a depression

88
00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:53.629
that she was never able
to come out of. all right?

89
00:05:53.767 --> 00:05:57.080
Our marriage of
13 years was destroyed

90
00:05:57.218 --> 00:06:00.601
because of the stupid
decision by one individual

91
00:06:00.739 --> 00:06:04.122
who chose to get in his car
after he'd been drinking.

92
00:06:05.503 --> 00:06:07.608
So that's what
I want you to remember.

93
00:06:09.196 --> 00:06:11.578
The next time
you've had even one drink.

94
00:06:13.752 --> 00:06:15.098
and you choose
to get in your car.

95
00:06:15.236 --> 00:06:17.515
it's not just your life
you're messing with.

96
00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:19.724
It's all of ours.

97
00:06:24.418 --> 00:06:25.557

- Thank you. Mr. Duvalier.

99
00:06:27.145 --> 00:06:30.044
for that incredibly
heartbreaking lesson.

100
00:06:30.182 --> 00:06:31.977
Now. before
you go. I need each of you

101
00:06:32.115 --> 00:06:33.807
to list
the three colors mentioned

102
00:06:33.945 --> 00:06:35.395
in the order
they were mentioned in.

103
00:06:35.533 --> 00:06:38.674
Please leave your notebooks
outside of the basket.

104
00:06:38.812 --> 00:06:39.951
Have a nice night.

be a rough few weeks

108
00:06:57.037 --> 00:06:59.453
managing these
classes on my own.

109
00:07:00.385 --> 00:07:01.800
You know. I said it before.

110
00:07:01.938 --> 00:07:04.734
but they don't listen to
me like they listen to you.

111
00:07:04.872 --> 00:07:07.427
- Sure they do. They'll be fine.

112
00:07:09.152 --> 00:07:11.914
- How much work do you have
ahead of you. you think?

113
00:07:13.122 --> 00:07:15.193
- I don't know. I mean. the
inspector has a whole list

114
00:07:15.331 --> 00:07:17.402
of things
that we can either do ourselves

115
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:20.440
or pay someone to
do. so I don't know.

116
00:07:20.578 --> 00:07:22.062
we're just going
to work with the agency

117
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.685
and see if we can
get the place to a spot

118
00:07:24.823 --> 00:07:27.205
where we get at least
a decent return on it.

119
00:07:28.378 --> 00:07:29.656
- No offense. Andre.

120
00:07:29.794 --> 00:07:32.452
but I've never
considered you a handyman.

121
00:07:33.418 --> 00:07:37.077
- Well. you'd know. and I
guess we're going to find out.

122
00:07:39.631 --> 00:07:42.841
- How's your wife
doing? Monica. right?

123
00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:44.912
- Yeah. still Monica.

124
00:07:46.224 --> 00:07:51.609
- She pretty broken up about
selling her dad's old place?

125
00:07:53.127 --> 00:07:54.853
- No. not really.

126
00:07:54.991 --> 00:07:58.132
I mean. she just wants it over
with. as far as I can tell.

127
00:07:59.133 --> 00:08:00.238
I never met him.

128
00:08:00.376 --> 00:08:02.758
I mean. he was diagnosed
with MS a few years ago.

129
00:08:02.896 --> 00:08:05.692
and apparently
it was pretty bad.

130
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.694
because he died shortly after.

131
00:08:09.143 --> 00:08:11.387
Monica moved in to
try to help him out.

132
00:08:12.215 --> 00:08:13.631
fix their fractured
relationship.

133
00:08:13.769 --> 00:08:16.875
but it didn't
really turn out that way.

134
00:08:17.013 --> 00:08:19.878
- Jesus. that's rough.

135
00:08:21.224 --> 00:08:22.122
- Yeah.

136
00:08:23.054 --> 00:08:25.746
Yeah. it turns out that was
a bad year for everyone.

137
00:08:26.851 --> 00:08:28.197
- Sorry. Andre.

138
00:08:28.335 --> 00:08:30.613
- No. I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to dour the mood.

139
00:08:30.751 --> 00:08:32.373
- No. not at all.

140
00:08:33.443 --> 00:08:37.378
In fact. you're one of the
best examples I can think of

141
00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:40.450
when it comes to dealing
with something like this.

142
00:08:40.589 --> 00:08:42.694
- Yeah. right.
- I'm serious.

143
00:08:42.832 --> 00:08:47.492
Not a lot of people can take
that pain and wickedness

144
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.184
and spin it into
something positive.

145
00:08:50.322 --> 00:08:53.222
Even though you can be a
pain in the ass sometimes.

146

- No. not all of it.

- Honey. come on.

out for a quick 3.000 steps.

I'll pack. We'll go.

do that right now?

levels me out. all right?

work I'm going to have to do

yeah. I have to do it now.

make this linger on.

[ominous music continues]

177
00:11:41.735 --> 00:11:43.944
- [Monica's Dad] Monica!

178
00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:57.337
[ominous music continues]

179
00:11:59.166 --> 00:12:01.065
- [Andre] Listen. I appreciate

180
00:12:01.203 --> 00:12:02.722
that this is
difficult for you. honey.

181
00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:07.071
- [Monica] No. it's not
difficult. It's not difficult.

182
00:12:08.244 --> 00:12:11.006
We're just going to help
renovate a crummy little house

183
00:12:11.144 --> 00:12:12.939
to be sold. and that's
how I want to keep it.

184
00:12:13.077 --> 00:12:14.803
It's just like
any other project.

185
00:12:14.941 --> 00:12:16.528
- Monica.
- What?

186
00:12:16.666 --> 00:12:19.186
- [Andre] If you don't deal
with it now. you'll regret it.

187
00:12:19.324 --> 00:12:21.464
- [Monica] There's
nothing to deal with.

188
00:12:21.602 --> 00:12:22.914
- [Andre] If you don't face it

189
00:12:23.052 --> 00:12:25.330
and accept
your feeling about it now.

190
00:12:25.468 --> 00:12:28.195
it's going to eventually
explode out of you.

191
00:12:28.333 --> 00:12:31.612
It'll come crashing down. You
need to trust me on this one.

192
00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:35.547
- [Monica] I agree with you.
but there's nothing to face.

193
00:12:35.685 --> 00:12:37.618
I haven't given this place
a single moment's thought

194
00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:40.552
in seven years because
every moment I spent there

195
00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:42.278
has been nothing but trouble.

196
00:12:43.452 --> 00:12:45.109
If it were up to me.

197
00:12:45.247 --> 00:12:47.490
I'd burn the fucking
place to the ground.

These are pretty cool.

203
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.333
Oh. check this out.

204
00:13:41.061 --> 00:13:42.614
We can paint a heart on this.

205
00:13:44.478 --> 00:13:45.376
Okay.

206
00:13:48.689 --> 00:13:49.587
I like this.

207
00:13:53.487 --> 00:13:56.525
Don't lose an eye
on this branch here.

208
00:13:56.663 --> 00:13:58.872
- Okay.
- Okay.

[door creaking]

213
00:14:32.423 --> 00:14:33.424
Nice.

214
00:14:34.839 --> 00:14:35.909
- Yeah. right.

215
00:14:37.152 --> 00:14:39.948
- I mean. very.
very Bo Peep-ish.

216
00:14:40.776 --> 00:14:44.055
- God. even the smell
of this place scares me.

217
00:14:44.193 --> 00:14:46.471
It's nauseating.

218
00:14:46.609 --> 00:14:47.507
- I don't know.

219
00:14:48.232 --> 00:14:51.649
some love and
care. elbow grease.

220
00:14:51.787 --> 00:14:54.376
dozens of hours
over the next few weeks.

221
00:14:55.032 --> 00:14:56.240
I'm sure we can turn this place

222
00:14:56.378 --> 00:14:58.483
into a moderately
priced piece of shit.

223
00:15:00.623 --> 00:15:01.521
Come here.

224
00:15:03.454 --> 00:15:05.801
This is all
going to be so much fun.

225
00:15:05.939 --> 00:15:07.009
- Mm-hm.

226
00:15:10.116 --> 00:15:12.325
- [Monica's Dad] Monica!

227
00:15:21.748 --> 00:15:25.372
[ominous music continues]

228
00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:36.004

232
00:16:01.167 --> 00:16:03.721
- Hello. I'm Cameron Yrjason.

233
00:16:04.549 --> 00:16:07.380
I'm an inspector with
Ravenwood Home Realty.

234
00:16:07.518 --> 00:16:09.934
We spoke on
the phone. Andre. right?

235
00:16:10.072 --> 00:16:12.764
- Yeah. hi. This
is my wife Monica.

236
00:16:12.902 --> 00:16:15.422
It's her dad's place.
- Yeah? That's nice.

237
00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:19.668
I really do think you got

238
00:16:19.806 --> 00:16:21.428
some beautiful
grounds here. though.

239
00:16:21.566 --> 00:16:23.948
There's a lot of
potential out here.

240
00:16:24.086 --> 00:16:27.365
Probably have to rip out
some of this stuff. though.

241
00:16:27.503 --> 00:16:32.198
And I've got a guy coming
out to do the landscaping.

242
00:16:33.889 --> 00:16:39.101
Ken really insisted that
we accentuate the yard.

243
00:16:39.377 --> 00:16:40.965
- Whose end is
that going to come out of?

244
00:16:41.103 --> 00:16:42.173
- Andre.

245
00:16:43.485 --> 00:16:44.900
- What?

246
00:16:45.038 --> 00:16:47.144
I mean. what's it even mean
to accentuate the yard. right?

247
00:16:47.282 --> 00:16:49.111
This place has
been vacant for years.

248
00:16:49.249 --> 00:16:51.148
What do they think the front
yard is going to look like?

249
00:16:51.286 --> 00:16:52.735
- I understand your frustration.

250
00:16:52.873 --> 00:16:55.462
but the guy I've got coming
out. he works for a deal.

251
00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.086
Oh. and got
another guy coming out

252
00:16:58.224 --> 00:16:59.742
to take a look at the shingles.

253
00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.021
They look a bit weathered.

254
00:17:02.159 --> 00:17:03.746
- No. I think
I can take care of that.

255
00:17:03.884 --> 00:17:07.716
- Well. we'd like to make
sure it's done right.

256
00:17:07.854 --> 00:17:10.857
That way we don't have
to pay to do it twice.

257
00:17:10.995 --> 00:17:13.584
- Yeah. I could handle
re-shingling the roof.

258
00:17:20.487 --> 00:17:22.282
This is nice. isn't it?
- Hm?

259
00:17:24.664 --> 00:17:25.561
- The fire.

260
00:17:27.667 --> 00:17:28.530
The quiet.

261
00:17:30.946 --> 00:17:32.465
This is nice. It's simple.

262
00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:34.812
- Yeah. I guess.

263
00:17:35.985 --> 00:17:37.263
- I can cut some more wood

264
00:17:37.401 --> 00:17:39.161
and we can do this
again tomorrow night.

265
00:17:39.299 --> 00:17:40.369
- Sure.

266
00:17:42.233 --> 00:17:44.097
- You okay?
- Mm-hm.

267
00:17:44.822 --> 00:17:46.099
- Are you sure?

268
00:17:46.755 --> 00:17:50.483
I know being out here again
afterwards must be hard.

269
00:17:52.588 --> 00:17:57.145
- It's not hard. Strange. maybe.

270
00:17:57.283 --> 00:17:58.387
Bizarre.

271
00:18:00.941 --> 00:18:03.047
- Yeah. that's okay.

272
00:18:03.185 --> 00:18:06.085
I mean. strange is okay. right?

273
00:18:06.223 --> 00:18:09.536
I mean.
I remember the last thing

274
00:18:09.674 --> 00:18:11.883
that Lenora and I did together.

275
00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:14.265
We watched...

276
00:18:15.439 --> 00:18:17.889
We watched
a Nickelodeon documentary.

277
00:18:18.027 --> 00:18:20.858
She was already watching
it when I came downstairs.

278
00:18:21.824 --> 00:18:26.657
I don't know why. but I sat
down next to her on the couch.

279
00:18:26.795 --> 00:18:30.764
and we watched
the whole thing together.

280
00:18:31.627 --> 00:18:35.493
Mostly quiet. though.
because most 14-year-olds

281
00:18:35.631 --> 00:18:38.669
don't really want to watch
anything with their dad.

282
00:18:38.807 --> 00:18:39.877
But it was nice.

283
00:18:43.432 --> 00:18:46.642
And about a year or
so after the accident.

284
00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:50.646
I was flipping
through the channels again.

285
00:18:51.854 --> 00:18:54.443
and the Nickelodeon logo
flashed across the screen.

286
00:18:54.581 --> 00:18:57.722
and that's when it hit me that

287
00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:01.209
that was actually the last
thing that we ever did together.

288
00:19:02.486 --> 00:19:04.212
- Thank you for that.

289
00:19:06.628 --> 00:19:11.633
- My point is.
it was strange. I mean-

290
00:19:11.771 --> 00:19:13.531
- It's not.
I'm not talking about it-

291
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:17.777
- To confront that
memory and thought. okay?

292
00:19:17.915 --> 00:19:20.159
But. I mean.
now when I think back at it.

293
00:19:20.297 --> 00:19:21.712
I think about it fondly.

294
00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:25.578
I know it's stupid. but when
I see the Nickelodeon logo.

295
00:19:25.716 --> 00:19:29.306
of all things. it makes
me feel closer to her.

296
00:19:30.376 --> 00:19:32.516
So yeah. I had to
go through that thought

297
00:19:32.654 --> 00:19:34.034
being a really bad one

298
00:19:34.173 --> 00:19:37.176
before it could turn
into a really good one.

299
00:19:37.314 --> 00:19:38.660
- Well. I don't think

300
00:19:38.798 --> 00:19:40.455
that's going to be
happening with this place.

301
00:19:40.593 --> 00:19:42.284
- Well. not at first. no.
but if you just give it time-

302
00:19:42.422 --> 00:19:45.045
- Look. I don't
talk about it much.

303
00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:47.807
You know that I don't
like to talk about it.

304
00:19:53.847 --> 00:19:58.818
My dad was old and really.
really not all there in the end.

305
00:20:00.095 --> 00:20:02.684
I think we. or at least I.

306
00:20:02.822 --> 00:20:05.376
made our peace
in those final days.

307
00:20:05.514 --> 00:20:07.896
I'm not worried
about opening old wounds

308
00:20:08.034 --> 00:20:11.002
of his past bullshit and
all the stuff he did to me.

309
00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.626
I just don't like this place.

310
00:20:15.455 --> 00:20:16.870
This house is like a black hole

311
00:20:17.008 --> 00:20:18.838
that just sucks everything
in and then spits out.

312
00:20:18.976 --> 00:20:21.427
Like. of course the
shingles need replacing

313
00:20:21.565 --> 00:20:22.911
and the foundation is crumbling.

314
00:20:23.049 --> 00:20:25.534
This house is
the bane of my existence.

315
00:20:25.672 --> 00:20:28.917
and the faster that I can
put it behind me. the better.

316
00:20:31.816 --> 00:20:32.679
Okay?

317
00:20:35.061 --> 00:20:35.958
- Okay.

is officially re-shingled.

- Oh. good.

Dipshit's here. though.

with some hired help.

347
00:24:06.134 --> 00:24:08.101
They pulled in right
as I was finishing up.

348

00:24:14.487 --> 00:24:15.523
He's like a robot.

352
00:24:15.661 --> 00:24:17.973
He's like. hello. Mr. Duvalier!

353
00:24:19.354 --> 00:24:21.667
We spoke on the phone!

354
00:24:21.805 --> 00:24:24.946
- Okay. I get it!

355
00:24:25.084 --> 00:24:26.326
- Geez. what's...

356
00:24:26.465 --> 00:24:27.880
What's your deal?

357
00:24:28.018 --> 00:24:29.778
- My deal? I'm just trying
to get this shit done.

358
00:24:29.916 --> 00:24:31.608
No one is having a picnic here.

359
00:24:31.746 --> 00:24:33.886
- It was a joke. all right?

360
00:24:34.024 --> 00:24:35.404
I'm just trying to bring levity

361
00:24:35.543 --> 00:24:37.545
to a tense
situation. that's all.

362
00:24:43.102 --> 00:24:45.207
You know what.
I'm going to go for a walk.

363
00:24:45.345 --> 00:24:46.243
- Okay.

[birds chirping]

366
00:25:02.431 --> 00:25:05.918
- Oh. Mr. Duvalier. How
are you doing today?

367
00:25:06.056 --> 00:25:08.265
- I'm all right.
How about yourself?

368
00:25:08.403 --> 00:25:09.749
- I'm doing well.

369
00:25:09.887 --> 00:25:13.097
just came out to look
at the water spigots.

370
00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:18.033
Oh. I also wanted you to
meet Gregory over here.

371
00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:20.760
Gregory!

372
00:25:22.348 --> 00:25:24.523
- Hey. Gregory. Nice
to meet you.

373
00:25:30.977 --> 00:25:32.772
All right. well. I'll let
you two get back to it. then.

374
00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:33.980
- Oh. one more thing.

375
00:25:34.118 --> 00:25:36.638
I have the roofer
coming out today

376
00:25:36.776 --> 00:25:37.950
to look at those shingles.

377
00:25:38.088 --> 00:25:40.262
- Oh. no need.
I was just up there.

378
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.127
Fixed a couple rough spots.
but didn't look that bad.

379
00:25:43.265 --> 00:25:47.994
- Oh. wish you would've told
me you were going to do that.

380
00:25:48.132 --> 00:25:50.376
I wouldn't want
your time to go to waste.

381
00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:52.861
- Why would my
time have gone to waste?

- Modification? But you're
the one that said...

386
00:26:11.224 --> 00:26:14.296

- Hello?

412
00:29:56.587 --> 00:29:57.726
Hello there?

413
00:29:57.865 --> 00:29:58.935
- Hi.

414
00:30:00.419 --> 00:30:03.387
- I thought
I saw people over here.

415
00:30:03.525 --> 00:30:06.011
Thought I'd come welcome
you to the neighborhood.

416
00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:09.600
The name's
Dorian Tobin Ryan III.

417
00:30:09.738 --> 00:30:11.257
Please. just call me Dorian.

418
00:30:12.741 --> 00:30:14.295
- That's quite the mouthful.

419
00:30:16.366 --> 00:30:17.643
- I sure can be.

420
00:30:17.781 --> 00:30:19.679
I saw that someone had moved it.

421
00:30:19.818 --> 00:30:22.027
and I thought I'd bring
a bottle of wine over

422
00:30:22.165 --> 00:30:24.512
to celebrate
with my new neighbors.

423
00:30:25.685 --> 00:30:26.583
- Neighbors?

424
00:30:28.343 --> 00:30:31.036
- Travel trailer
down the road. like.

425
00:30:31.174 --> 00:30:34.280
Found a lovely spot to
rent. You'll love it.

426
00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:38.526
Well. I hate to intrude. but
I've been passing this place

427
00:30:38.664 --> 00:30:39.976
for a couple of weeks now.

428
00:30:40.114 --> 00:30:42.392
and I've always wanted
to see the inside of it.

429
00:30:43.255 --> 00:30:45.498
Would you mind if
we had a glass of wine?

430
00:30:47.742 --> 00:30:48.639
- Why not?

431
00:30:53.644 --> 00:30:58.615
So. what's with
the accent? Is it real?

432
00:30:59.858 --> 00:31:03.068
- No. I just use it to
pick up all the girls.

433
00:31:06.726 --> 00:31:09.557
How lovely.
You just buy the place?

434
00:31:10.454 --> 00:31:13.457
- No. just getting
it ready to be sold.

435
00:31:13.595 --> 00:31:16.840
- Ah. so you're a local.

436
00:31:16.978 --> 00:31:20.879
- It was my late father's place.

437
00:31:22.294 --> 00:31:23.640
- I'm so sorry.

438
00:31:25.297 --> 00:31:26.988
- At least he didn't suffer.

439
00:31:27.678 --> 00:31:29.197
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

440
00:31:31.475 --> 00:31:34.478
- Nothing is as it seems. Andre.

441
00:31:34.616 --> 00:31:38.620
You must leave that
house. It belongs to us.

442
00:31:38.758 --> 00:31:42.003
- House. You mean my
wife's father's place?

443
00:31:42.141 --> 00:31:43.625
- You must take
her away from there.

444
00:31:43.763 --> 00:31:45.731
- Who? Monica?

445
00:31:46.559 --> 00:31:49.631
Wait a minute. how do you
know so much about who I am?

446
00:31:50.494 --> 00:31:53.946
- We cannot tell you that
now. and pray that never is.

447
00:31:55.223 --> 00:31:56.397
- Okay. you know what.

448
00:31:56.535 --> 00:31:58.226
I don't think I'm
getting any of this.

449
00:31:58.951 --> 00:32:00.711
Why is that. exactly?

450
00:32:00.849 --> 00:32:02.955
- You are all in grave peril!

451
00:32:03.852 --> 00:32:04.923
- Peril?

452
00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:08.961
- Take Monica and stay far away

453
00:32:09.099 --> 00:32:11.791
from that place
before it's too late.

454
00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:14.346
- Oh yeah? Who says?

455
00:32:18.798 --> 00:32:22.595
- If you listen closely.
their voices can be heard.

456
00:32:25.391 --> 00:32:27.600
You must get
her away from there!

457
00:32:27.738 --> 00:32:29.223
You must not let her stay!

458
00:32:31.363 --> 00:32:33.261
You must close that door.

459
00:32:34.607 --> 00:32:36.678
[both laughing]

460
00:32:36.816 --> 00:32:37.714
- Funny story.

461
00:32:40.889 --> 00:32:42.546
- That's grand.
- Hey.

462
00:32:42.684 --> 00:32:44.065
- Oh. Hey. honey.

463
00:32:46.343 --> 00:32:47.586
- Who's this?

464
00:32:47.724 --> 00:32:49.346
- This is Dorian.
our temporary neighbor.

465
00:32:49.484 --> 00:32:51.314
- You must be
the lovely husband.

466
00:32:51.452 --> 00:32:53.212
I've heard so much about you.

467
00:32:54.006 --> 00:32:55.076
- Yep.

468
00:32:56.284 --> 00:32:58.390
- The name's
Dorian Tobin Ryan III.

469
00:32:58.528 --> 00:33:00.392
but you can just call me Dorian.

470
00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:02.497
- Andre.

471
00:33:07.813 --> 00:33:12.093
That's quite
the accent there. Dorian.

472
00:33:12.231 --> 00:33:13.715
Where do you hail from?

473
00:33:13.853 --> 00:33:15.096
- Dublin. in Ireland.

474
00:33:17.443 --> 00:33:21.171
- Right. Well. what
brings you to these parts?

475
00:33:22.828 --> 00:33:26.625
- Pleasure. mate. I've always
wanted to see the States.

476
00:33:29.386 --> 00:33:31.699
Ah. Apothic Inferno.

477

best gas station
cabernet money can buy.

478
00:33:38.257 --> 00:33:39.707
- Plan on
sticking around a while?

479
00:33:39.845 --> 00:33:41.226
- [Dorian] Ah. well.

480
00:33:41.364 --> 00:33:43.538
- I've got a bottle of
1975 Lustau Amontillado

481
00:33:43.676 --> 00:33:46.334
in the car. brought it
for such an occasion.

482
00:33:47.473 --> 00:33:48.716
We could fry up some burgers.

483
00:33:48.854 --> 00:33:50.718
We picked some up
on the way in from town.

484
00:33:50.856 --> 00:33:52.789
- Sounds lovely. mate.

485
00:33:53.548 --> 00:33:55.757
- Honey. would you mind grabbing

486
00:33:55.895 --> 00:33:57.380
the burgers out of the fridge

487
00:33:57.518 --> 00:34:00.176
while our new friend here
and I go get the Amontillado?

488
00:34:00.314 --> 00:34:02.454
- Sure.
- Great.

489
00:34:05.215 --> 00:34:06.837
- Just don't wall this one up.

490
00:34:17.848 --> 00:34:21.473
[ominous music continues]

491
00:34:31.276 --> 00:34:33.381
- So how is
it exactly you have the means

492
00:34:33.519 --> 00:34:35.521
to travel around
the United States?

493
00:34:35.659 --> 00:34:36.557
- Andre.

494
00:34:37.523 --> 00:34:39.801
- What?
- Don't be rude.

495
00:34:39.939 --> 00:34:41.424
- Look. I don't mind.

496
00:34:41.562 --> 00:34:43.771
I've been fortunate enough
to be one of the lucky few

497
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:46.739
that has the monetary
ability to get. you know.

498
00:34:46.877 --> 00:34:51.537
and/or do anything
that he wants to do.

499
00:34:51.675 --> 00:34:54.368
and yet I've not been able
to find anything to do.

500
00:34:55.058 --> 00:34:59.131
My great grandfather.
God rest his soul.

501
00:34:59.269 --> 00:35:01.340
found himself
on the positive end

502
00:35:01.478 --> 00:35:03.411
of an up and coming
calibrations company.

503
00:35:03.549 --> 00:35:05.068
and my father
followed in his footsteps

504
00:35:05.206 --> 00:35:07.829
and worked for Renshaw. and
I worked there long enough

505
00:35:07.967 --> 00:35:10.349
to realize
that I'd rather spend my time

506
00:35:10.487 --> 00:35:13.421
living the life that they
worked their asses off for.

507
00:35:14.181 --> 00:35:15.975
- Hm. Well. you're a lucky boy.

508
00:35:16.114 --> 00:35:19.186
- Oddly. this is my
first time in America.

509
00:35:20.359 --> 00:35:23.155
Folks didn't like it very
much for the holidays.

510
00:35:23.293 --> 00:35:28.056
Seeing it by the freeway is
the only way to see America.

511
00:35:28.195 --> 00:35:32.199
I just find myself looking
out at the endless scenery.

512
00:35:32.337 --> 00:35:35.685
thinking about
John Wayne and the Indians.

513
00:35:35.823 --> 00:35:37.169
Oh. it's great.

514
00:35:38.481 --> 00:35:40.034
- Yeah. we don't call
them Indians anymore.

515
00:35:40.172 --> 00:35:41.794
- Andre.
- What now?

516
00:35:41.932 --> 00:35:43.555
- Don't be a jerk.

517
00:35:46.351 --> 00:35:47.421
Excuse me.

518
00:35:55.636 --> 00:35:58.949
[ominous music continues]

519
00:35:59.087 --> 00:36:00.158
- Hm.
- Hm.

520
00:36:05.473 --> 00:36:07.682
- [Monica's Dad] Monica!

521
00:36:15.863 --> 00:36:18.624
[light buzzing]

522
00:36:21.558 --> 00:36:23.905
- So how long do you plan
on sticking around for?

523
00:36:24.043 --> 00:36:26.908
- Probably a week or so.

524
00:36:27.046 --> 00:36:29.359
You know. being on
the road is exhausting.

525
00:36:29.497 --> 00:36:32.983
Once you find a pretty
place. it's hard to leave.

526
00:36:33.121 --> 00:36:35.296
- Well. you managed to find
yourself a pretty place

527
00:36:35.434 --> 00:36:37.954
pretty far off the
beaten path. haven't you?

528
00:36:39.576 --> 00:36:42.303
Speaking of.
have you had a chance

529
00:36:42.441 --> 00:36:44.063
to get to know any
of the locals around?

530
00:36:44.202 --> 00:36:48.896
- A little. you know. not much
in the way of people to meet.

531
00:36:49.034 --> 00:36:51.174
At least not until now. anyways.

532
00:36:51.312 --> 00:36:52.382
- Thanks.

533
00:36:53.659 --> 00:36:56.386
And yeah. you know.
I've noticed that too.

534
00:36:58.906 --> 00:36:59.803
Except.

535
00:37:01.633 --> 00:37:04.670
I keep seeing
this young blind woman.

536
00:37:05.844 --> 00:37:08.536
- A blind woman?
- Yeah.

537
00:37:09.744 --> 00:37:11.470
I see her wandering
along the forest edge.

538
00:37:11.608 --> 00:37:15.405
if you take a left there
just past Ravenwood Avenue.

539
00:37:17.752 --> 00:37:22.032
- That's right where my camper's
at. and I'm telling you.

540
00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:24.449
I've never seen no blind woman.

- Coming. Father.

[whispers echoing]

555

All red.

556

Coming. Father.

557
00:39:32.197 --> 00:39:33.094

[ominous music continues]

569
00:40:55.901 --> 00:40:57.109
- You're not hungry?

570
00:41:01.355 --> 00:41:02.252
Honey?

571
00:41:03.668 --> 00:41:04.979
Are you hungry?

572
00:41:05.117 --> 00:41:08.258
- Yes. I know.
- I didn't hear you.

573
00:41:08.396 --> 00:41:09.915
- I shook my head.

574
00:41:11.434 --> 00:41:12.953
- I can't hear head shakes.

575
00:41:16.266 --> 00:41:20.719
You know what. I think today
I'm going to tackle the pipes.

576
00:41:21.513 --> 00:41:23.481
That's something the
inspector was talking about.

577
00:41:23.619 --> 00:41:27.001
so I'm going to give it a
shot instead of having to pay

578
00:41:27.139 --> 00:41:29.556
someone else 25
bucks an hour to do it.

579
00:41:33.214 --> 00:41:34.112
Are you okay?

580
00:41:38.012 --> 00:41:40.877
- No. I am not all right.

581
00:41:41.015 --> 00:41:43.224
I've been sleeping terribly.

582
00:41:43.362 --> 00:41:45.986
I've hardly gotten anything
done on this house.

583
00:41:46.124 --> 00:41:48.920
Every day. there's
some new major problem

584
00:41:49.058 --> 00:41:52.061
that has to be fixed.
and I just can't stand

585
00:41:52.199 --> 00:41:56.168
you of all people
giving me shit about it!

586
00:41:56.306 --> 00:42:00.863
Yes. thank you. I know that
this house is a black hole.

587
00:42:01.001 --> 00:42:03.210
a bottomless
money pit of despair.

588
00:42:03.348 --> 00:42:05.902
I'm the one that's been
saying it all along!

589
00:42:06.869 --> 00:42:08.940
- Jesus. never mind.

590
00:42:09.078 --> 00:42:11.494
- Well. if
you don't like the answer.

591
00:42:11.632 --> 00:42:14.221
then don't fucking ask!

592
00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:25.301
[door creaking]

593
00:42:28.235 --> 00:42:30.720
- Oh. Mr. Duvalier.

594
00:42:33.999 --> 00:42:36.657
We need to talk about
that roofing job you did.

595
00:42:39.729 --> 00:42:40.799
- Goddamn.

596
00:42:44.009 --> 00:42:47.875
[Monica breathing heavily]

597
00:42:57.471 --> 00:43:01.095
[ominous music continues]

598
00:43:10.691 --> 00:43:13.970
[ominous music continues]

599
00:43:14.108 --> 00:43:18.285
- So when you pull back the
shingle. it creates damage.

600
00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:20.770
- But you have to
pull back the shingle

601
00:43:20.908 --> 00:43:22.254
so you can see
where the nail is.

602
00:43:22.392 --> 00:43:25.016
- But if you pull
it back and crease it.

603
00:43:25.775 --> 00:43:27.639
that's where the damage is.

604
00:43:27.777 --> 00:43:29.020
- What are you talking about?

605
00:43:29.158 --> 00:43:30.677
Where did I crease the shingles?

606
00:43:30.815 --> 00:43:33.541
- I myself am not
an expert on roofing.

607
00:43:34.301 --> 00:43:38.132
That's why I bring out an
expert to do these repairs.

608
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:39.962
I am only
an expert on the policy.

609
00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:43.621
- Listen. I know how to
re-shingle a roof. all right?

610
00:43:43.759 --> 00:43:45.139
I've done it many times.

611
00:43:45.277 --> 00:43:48.591
- Well. whatever it is
that happened up there.

612
00:43:48.729 --> 00:43:50.628
it caused
damage to the shingles.

613
00:43:50.766 --> 00:43:52.250
- What? How?

614
00:43:52.388 --> 00:43:55.149
- That's why I like to bring
in an expert to do this.

615
00:43:55.287 --> 00:43:56.634
- Why don't I go
get the ladder. then?

616
00:43:56.772 --> 00:43:58.221
You and I can go up on the roof.

617
00:43:58.359 --> 00:44:00.327
and you can show
me where the damage is.

618
00:44:00.465 --> 00:44:01.431
- I can't do that.

619
00:44:02.225 --> 00:44:04.918
Again. I am not an expert.

620
00:44:05.056 --> 00:44:06.851
I'm only
an expert on the policy.

621
00:44:06.989 --> 00:44:09.336
- No. clearly you are an expert.

622
00:44:09.474 --> 00:44:11.372
because you're telling me
the way I did it is wrong.

623
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:14.306
- Mr. Duvalier.
I don't want to argue.

624
00:44:14.997 --> 00:44:17.793
- Fine. bring out your guy.

625
00:44:18.897 --> 00:44:20.140
I don't care anymore.

626
00:44:22.004 --> 00:44:24.178
- Oh. and one more
thing. Mr. Duvalier.

627
00:44:25.766 --> 00:44:28.113
I need to get
into the kitchen today

628
00:44:28.251 --> 00:44:30.840
to take a look at those
pipes under the sink.

629
00:44:32.255 --> 00:44:36.018
- Go talk to Monica. I'm
sure she'd love that.

Mary!

- Mary.

647
00:46:44.422 --> 00:46:48.288
That name sounds so strange
to me here by the sun.

648
00:46:51.153 --> 00:46:53.362
- It's your name. Mary.

649
00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:56.641
Don't you remember?

650
00:46:57.331 --> 00:47:00.541
- I have no
name. They told me so.

651
00:47:01.957 --> 00:47:03.234
- They lie!

652
00:47:03.372 --> 00:47:05.615
- They summon me from the dark.

653
00:47:08.826 --> 00:47:12.726
- You must go back. Mary.

654
00:47:12.864 --> 00:47:14.176
- To the house.

655
00:47:16.626 --> 00:47:18.836
- To the dark. Mary.

656
00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:23.219
- Only when
the dark leaves the crypt.

657
00:47:23.357 --> 00:47:27.223
we shall all rest
together. them and I.

658
00:47:28.466 --> 00:47:31.158
- Something is not
right with that place!

659
00:47:32.366 --> 00:47:34.265
The fear is getting to me.

660
00:47:35.956 --> 00:47:37.026
That man.

661
00:47:39.546 --> 00:47:40.443

love. How're you doing?

I was just needing to
borrow your hose to fill up

680
00:50:41.797 --> 00:50:44.765
a water tank for my travel
trailer. is that all right?

681
00:50:47.285 --> 00:50:48.769
Love. are you okay?

682
00:50:52.808 --> 00:50:54.672
Okay. I'm just going
to go and get the hose

683
00:50:54.810 --> 00:50:57.813
and I'll fill it up and
I'll bring it back shortly.

684
00:50:57.951 --> 00:51:00.816
All right. thank you so
much. I'll see you in a bit.

685

- We would truly
like to help you. Andre.

686
00:51:10.308 --> 00:51:12.828
but this is something
you must do on your own.

687
00:51:14.657 --> 00:51:18.178
- Listen. I don't know what
you're going through out here.

688
00:51:18.316 --> 00:51:20.491
but there are
people that can help you.

689
00:51:21.319 --> 00:51:24.633
I mean. look at
you. You're barefoot.

690
00:51:25.496 --> 00:51:27.705
So let me take
you into town. okay?

691
00:51:29.086 --> 00:51:31.536
- You're a very
warm soul. Andre.

692
00:51:32.365 --> 00:51:33.745
- I just couldn't stop thinking

693
00:51:33.883 --> 00:51:36.231
about you wandering
around out here all alone.

694
00:51:37.542 --> 00:51:41.719
Please. I mean. after the
bullshit morning I've had.

695
00:51:42.789 --> 00:51:44.031
let me help you.

696
00:51:44.170 --> 00:51:45.895

697
00:51:46.033 --> 00:51:47.656
- Who?
- Your daughter.

698
00:51:53.765 --> 00:51:57.148
- How do
you know about my daughter?

699
00:52:00.738 --> 00:52:02.498
- I am possessed of the dead.

700
00:52:03.879 --> 00:52:04.811
- No. you're not.

701
00:52:05.501 --> 00:52:08.125
You're a warm.
living young woman.

702
00:52:08.263 --> 00:52:09.609
Where do
you even get these things?

703
00:52:09.747 --> 00:52:11.197
- The dead.

704
00:52:13.785 --> 00:52:15.891
- Yeah. you do.

705
00:52:17.099 --> 00:52:20.102
You remind me of Lenora. and
that is why I want to help you.

706
00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:24.002
so please let me
take you into town.

707
00:52:24.141 --> 00:52:26.971
There are people there
that can free you from-

708
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:28.179
- From the dead.

709
00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:37.671
[door knocking]

710
00:52:40.087 --> 00:52:44.782
We'd like to help you. Andre.
but you must help us first.

711
00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:48.751
- What? Tell me
what I can help you with.

712
00:52:48.889 --> 00:52:51.513
- We cannot stop the
forces which dwell beyond

713
00:52:51.651 --> 00:52:53.549
from influencing Monica.

714
00:52:53.687 --> 00:52:56.276
You must take
her away from that house.

715
00:52:57.898 --> 00:53:00.487
- I don't know how you
know so much about us.

716
00:53:01.523 --> 00:53:03.007
but it's starting to scare me.

717
00:53:03.145 --> 00:53:04.560
- Be scared. Andre.

718
00:53:05.596 --> 00:53:08.254
- You know what.
this is ridiculous.

719
00:53:10.256 --> 00:53:11.981
Look at you. all right?

720
00:53:12.119 --> 00:53:14.950
You're out here wandering
around wearing those clothes.

721
00:53:15.088 --> 00:53:17.642
you're barefoot.
and you can't even see.

722
00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:22.992
- I can see. I can see
things you wouldn't believe.

723
00:53:23.579 --> 00:53:28.377
In your worst nightmares.
you wouldn't believe.

724
00:53:29.102 --> 00:53:31.794
- Try me. What do you see?

725
00:53:33.624 --> 00:53:36.523
- I see the dead.
The city of the dead.

726
00:53:38.215 --> 00:53:41.218
[water bubbling]

727
00:53:47.465 --> 00:53:48.535
- Dammit!

728
00:53:50.606 --> 00:53:52.953
These pipes are leaking
all over the place.

729
00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:58.856
Going to have to call
my guy. Mrs. Duvalier.

730
00:53:59.719 --> 00:54:01.410
This is not up to policy.

731
00:54:04.171 --> 00:54:06.588
Mrs. Duvalier.
your water's boiling over.

732
00:54:12.076 --> 00:54:15.286
[Cameron screaming]

733
00:54:20.912 --> 00:54:23.812
[hammer thudding]

734
00:54:26.366 --> 00:54:29.438
[hammer thudding]

735
00:54:32.165 --> 00:54:35.064
[hammer thudding]

736
00:54:44.626 --> 00:54:48.423
[ominous music continues]

737
00:54:49.596 --> 00:54:52.116
- You must believe me. Andre.

738
00:54:52.254 --> 00:54:55.015
That house rests on one
of the seven gateways.

739
00:54:55.153 --> 00:54:58.640
the very door to the inferno.
and the name that rests on it

740
00:55:02.229 --> 00:55:03.300
is wrath.

741
00:55:07.476 --> 00:55:10.410
[head thudding]

742
00:55:12.481 --> 00:55:15.415
[head thudding]

743
00:55:22.042 --> 00:55:24.804
[flesh ripping]

744
00:55:33.399 --> 00:55:37.092
[Monica breathing heavily]

745
00:55:43.029 --> 00:55:45.756
- Please. just let me help you.

746
00:55:48.172 --> 00:55:53.073
I've got to do something
right today. and then fine.

747
00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:57.699
I'll get Monica and we
will leave tomorrow. okay?

748
00:56:00.391 --> 00:56:01.944
- It's too late for that.

749
00:56:11.644 --> 00:56:15.406
[ominous music continues]

750
00:56:22.309 --> 00:56:25.382
[Monica laughing]

751
00:56:34.598 --> 00:56:38.395
[ominous music continues]

752
00:56:46.644 --> 00:56:48.474
- Whoa!

753
00:56:48.612 --> 00:56:49.820
Oh!

754
00:56:49.958 --> 00:56:50.993
Andre. mate.

755
00:56:52.443 --> 00:56:53.927
How're you doing. mate?

756
00:56:54.065 --> 00:56:55.688
- You know.
I've seen better days.

757
00:56:55.826 --> 00:56:58.967
so I decided to go for a walk.

758
00:56:59.105 --> 00:57:02.177
That goddamn
inspector's up my ass. and...

759
00:57:03.972 --> 00:57:05.249
And Monica's having a hard time.

760
00:57:05.387 --> 00:57:07.527
- You know. that's
actually what I wanted

761
00:57:07.665 --> 00:57:09.356
to talk to you about.

762
00:57:09.495 --> 00:57:10.875
- Yeah?

763
00:57:11.013 --> 00:57:14.327
- Well. I stopped by to
say hi. and she seemed...

764
00:57:14.465 --> 00:57:16.053
She seemed awfully upset.

765
00:57:16.191 --> 00:57:19.263
I was wondering if I'd done
anything to offend you. mate.

766
00:57:19.401 --> 00:57:20.782
- No. not that I'm aware of.

767
00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:24.026
- I know. I know how it
must've looked. you know.

768
00:57:24.164 --> 00:57:27.167
me alone at home with
your missus like that.

769
00:57:27.305 --> 00:57:29.998
- You know. the thought
didn't even cross my mind.

770
00:57:30.136 --> 00:57:32.587
- Well. you're
a more trusting man than I.

771
00:57:32.725 --> 00:57:35.106
Anyway. I don't know
if you two had a fight.

772
00:57:35.244 --> 00:57:38.351
but oh. she's like a regular
Paddy with that bottle. mate.

773
00:57:39.041 --> 00:57:41.458
- What are you talking about?
- Well. as I was passing by.

774
00:57:41.596 --> 00:57:46.808
she was just pounding the
whiskey bottle. pounding it.

775
00:57:47.015 --> 00:57:49.224
Just drinking. and you
know. once they have

776
00:57:49.362 --> 00:57:51.675
too much to drink. then
they end up fighting.

777
00:57:51.813 --> 00:57:54.816
I would watch your back.
mate. You never know.

778
00:57:54.954 --> 00:57:57.025
See you later. mate.
- Yeah.

779
00:58:00.787 --> 00:58:03.790
[paper rustling]

780
00:58:10.763 --> 00:58:13.697
[door creaking]

781
00:58:15.077 --> 00:58:17.459
Oh. you took a shower. huh?

782
00:58:18.287 --> 00:58:21.221
- I took a shower.
- How was it?

783
00:58:21.981 --> 00:58:24.155
I was thinking
about taking one myself.

784
00:58:28.263 --> 00:58:29.160
You okay?

785
00:58:30.368 --> 00:58:31.266
- I'm okay.

786
00:58:40.655 --> 00:58:43.209
- Sure you don't
want to talk about it?

787
00:58:43.347 --> 00:58:45.452
- Talk about what?

788
00:58:45.591 --> 00:58:47.731
- Well. you're obviously upset.

789
00:58:47.869 --> 00:58:51.079
- Now. why would
I be upset. Andre?

790
00:58:52.494 --> 00:58:55.739
- You know what. never mind.

791
00:58:57.257 --> 00:59:01.330
You know. I was thinking. why
don't we just get out of here?

792
00:59:03.401 --> 00:59:07.647
I mean. we can let the inspector
hire whoever he needs to

793
00:59:07.785 --> 00:59:09.718
to do all the repairs.

794
00:59:09.856 --> 00:59:11.375
- Maybe we should do that.

795
00:59:12.169 --> 00:59:16.138
- Good. I'll try and talk with
him about it tomorrow. then.

796
00:59:23.629 --> 00:59:27.391
Oh. hey. did he talk to
you about the pipes at all?

797
00:59:27.529 --> 00:59:29.600
- Yep.
- What'd he say?

798
00:59:31.568 --> 00:59:34.778
- Well. he didn't feel good!

799
00:59:42.302 --> 00:59:46.997
Why don't you take a shower.
and I'll make some dinner

800
00:59:47.135 --> 00:59:49.931
and pour us
a couple glasses of wine.

801
00:59:52.623 --> 00:59:53.693
- [Andre] Okay.

802
01:00:02.564 --> 01:00:03.979
Where are all the towels?

803
01:00:07.707 --> 01:00:09.467
- They're all in the wash.

804
01:00:10.537 --> 01:00:12.885
There might be one
in my father's room.

805
01:00:14.541 --> 01:00:15.888
- [Andre] Cool. thanks.

806
01:00:25.691 --> 01:00:29.315
[ominous music continues]

807
01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:41.776
[whispers echoing]

808
01:00:48.852 --> 01:00:51.993
[flesh squelching]

809
01:01:01.692 --> 01:01:05.316
[ominous music continues]

810
01:01:14.705 --> 01:01:18.329
[ominous music continues]

811
01:01:20.297 --> 01:01:21.194
- Andre?

812
01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:24.577
- [Andre] Yeah?

813
01:01:24.715 --> 01:01:27.718
- I think there's something
I'd like to talk about.

814
01:01:29.237 --> 01:01:32.447
Something maybe now I'd
like to get off my chest.

815
01:01:42.664 --> 01:01:45.736
[napkin rustling]

816
01:01:54.676 --> 01:01:58.300
[ominous music continues]

817
01:02:02.511 --> 01:02:06.239
Guess I never really knew how
I'd deal with someone's death.

818
01:02:08.034 --> 01:02:10.002
- I don't think anyone does.

819
01:02:12.383 --> 01:02:15.904
- I came to stay with my
father in those final days.

820
01:02:17.250 --> 01:02:19.287
I didn't really
know what to expect.

821
01:02:23.601 --> 01:02:27.329
I don't think
I ever really expected to

822
01:02:27.467 --> 01:02:29.504
mend our relationship.

823
01:02:31.851 --> 01:02:35.061
I wasn't even sure if I'd
feel bad when he finally went.

824
01:02:39.583 --> 01:02:40.791
And I didn't.

825
01:02:42.034 --> 01:02:44.208
In all reality.
I enjoyed watching

826
01:02:44.346 --> 01:02:48.557
this awful.
controlling. manipulative man

827
01:02:48.695 --> 01:02:50.421
reduced to a blubbering lump.

828
01:02:52.285 --> 01:02:56.738
He went from.
"Monica. you're a screw-up."

829
01:02:56.876 --> 01:02:59.292
and. "Can't you do better?"

830
01:03:00.328 --> 01:03:03.503
to crying and
moaning at everything.

831
01:03:04.366 --> 01:03:09.371
"Monica. I need
you!" Not so tough now.

832
01:03:13.859 --> 01:03:17.345
I mean. the thought of him

833
01:03:17.483 --> 01:03:20.313
having to have
his diapers changed.

834
01:03:20.451 --> 01:03:25.249
the thought of that still
makes me laugh. [laughs]

835
01:03:31.462 --> 01:03:34.880
I've never been able to say
it out loud. but fuck it.

836
01:03:36.847 --> 01:03:38.538
I'm glad he's dead.

837
01:03:40.989 --> 01:03:44.993
He screwed me up.
He screwed my sister up.

838
01:03:48.307 --> 01:03:50.930
But when
he finally went that night.

839
01:03:53.070 --> 01:03:55.072
I was so disappointed.

840
01:03:58.904 --> 01:04:01.976
I wasn't done
watching him suffer.

841
01:04:04.461 --> 01:04:08.845
It was like after 27 years
of psychological torture.

842
01:04:10.225 --> 01:04:12.365
I was finally
getting things set right.

843
01:04:17.129 --> 01:04:19.925
[sighs] Geez.

844
01:04:21.133 --> 01:04:24.067
Thank you for listening.

845
01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:26.655
I feel so much better.

846
01:04:29.762 --> 01:04:30.659
- Sure.

847
01:04:39.737 --> 01:04:43.362
[ominous music continues]

848
01:04:53.096 --> 01:04:54.718
I think I'm going to go to bed.

849
01:04:55.892 --> 01:04:58.584
- Okay. I'm going to stay
up for a little while.

850
01:05:01.104 --> 01:05:02.174
- Goodnight.

851
01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:15.325

852
01:05:23.747 --> 01:05:26.508
[ominous music continues]

853
01:05:26.646 --> 01:05:27.544
- Mary?
- Hello.

854
01:05:31.237 --> 01:05:34.102
- I heard you crying.
- Did you?

855
01:05:42.697 --> 01:05:46.494
[ominous music continues]

856
01:05:46.632 --> 01:05:50.084
- Are you worried
about that place?

857
01:05:51.913 --> 01:05:54.502
That man and that lady?

858
01:05:56.504 --> 01:06:00.715
- Humans. They're
a lot like flowers.

859
01:06:02.061 --> 01:06:03.338
So beautiful.

860
01:06:05.513 --> 01:06:07.653
yet they die so easily.

861
01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:15.972

[ominous music continues]

865
01:06:44.034 --> 01:06:45.380
Andre. please.

866
01:06:47.037 --> 01:06:48.935
You must try to leave.

867
01:06:49.798 --> 01:06:53.285
There's something evil
here. something deep.

868
01:06:53.423 --> 01:06:56.564
soaked into
the grains of the wood.

869
01:06:57.944 --> 01:06:59.015
- I know.

870
01:07:00.637 --> 01:07:01.810
I feel it too.

871
01:07:02.708 --> 01:07:05.193
There's something
wrong with her house.

872
01:07:06.401 --> 01:07:09.473
- [Mary] Take Monica
and leave. if you can.

873
01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:13.581
This is not
her house. it's theirs.

874

[ominous music continues]

876
01:07:38.295 --> 01:07:43.507
- I know
you can hear me! Monica!

877
01:07:44.129 --> 01:07:45.199
Monica!

878
01:07:46.993 --> 01:07:48.064
Monica!

[pills rattling]

880
01:07:57.176 --> 01:07:58.246
Monica!

881
01:08:03.217 --> 01:08:04.287
Monica!

01:08:13.572 --> 01:08:16.022
[ominous music continues]

883
01:08:16.161 --> 01:08:17.231
Monica!

884
01:08:18.715 --> 01:08:20.130
Please. Monica!

885
01:08:23.651 --> 01:08:26.205
I need my medicine! Monica!

886
01:08:27.655 --> 01:08:30.485
[pills rattling]

[Monica gasping]

889
01:08:52.507 --> 01:08:54.371
- Seeing red again.

890

891
01:09:16.566 --> 01:09:20.363

[bottle clinking]

901
01:10:47.795 --> 01:10:51.592
- I saw those on one
of my walks. and I know

902
01:10:51.730 --> 01:10:55.251
you like that color. so I
thought you'd like them.

903
01:11:05.606 --> 01:11:09.368
[ominous music continues]

904
01:11:10.369 --> 01:11:14.097
I think I'm going
to talk to the inspector

905
01:11:14.235 --> 01:11:18.964
when he gets here.
tell him to just hire

906
01:11:19.102 --> 01:11:21.346
whoever he thinks
he needs. you know?

907
01:11:23.244 --> 01:11:28.422
Probably be best if we just
go home and get some rest.

908
01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:31.390
- Why?

909
01:11:36.809 --> 01:11:39.812
- I think this place...

910
01:11:45.404 --> 01:11:46.474
You know.

911
01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:49.097
I don't know.

912
01:11:50.167 --> 01:11:52.618
I mean. I think
we just need a break.

913
01:11:54.758 --> 01:11:57.451
- You think so. huh?
- Yeah.

914
01:11:58.452 --> 01:11:59.832
Yeah. I think so.
- Hm.

915
01:12:01.213 --> 01:12:02.835
And why is that?

916
01:12:03.974 --> 01:12:07.357
- Things have gotten really
weird since we've gotten here.

917
01:12:08.358 --> 01:12:13.536
The people here are
weird. and that inspector.

918
01:12:13.674 --> 01:12:17.988
he won't even budge just
a little bit. and...

919
01:12:20.301 --> 01:12:23.994
Monica. you're not yourself.

920
01:12:25.341 --> 01:12:28.896
You're obviously struggling.
and you won't even talk to me.

921
01:12:33.176 --> 01:12:35.937
- You want to
talk. huh? Let's talk.

922
01:12:41.149 --> 01:12:44.774
Well. what do
you want to talk about?

923
01:12:46.396 --> 01:12:48.536
- I just-
- No. come on.

924
01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:53.955
Why don't you tell me
again what's right for me.

925
01:12:54.093 --> 01:12:55.405
what I should do.

926
01:12:55.543 --> 01:12:58.374
how I clearly can't do anything
right by your standards?

927
01:12:58.512 --> 01:12:59.961
- That is not
what I'm trying to say.

928
01:13:00.099 --> 01:13:01.791
- Well. then try harder.

929
01:13:02.585 --> 01:13:04.759
Explain to me who wanted

930
01:13:04.897 --> 01:13:06.209
to come out here
in the first place.

931
01:13:06.347 --> 01:13:08.867
Explain to me how it was
right to come out here

932
01:13:09.005 --> 01:13:11.973
when I didn't want to
go in the first place.

933
01:13:12.111 --> 01:13:13.527
And now that we're here.

934
01:13:13.665 --> 01:13:16.184
my attitude isn't
quite to your liking.

935
01:13:17.082 --> 01:13:21.224
Why don't you tell me
again how wonderfully

936
01:13:21.362 --> 01:13:24.814
you handled Lenora's death
and how you're the expert

937
01:13:24.952 --> 01:13:27.713
on what everyone
should feel and think?

938
01:13:27.851 --> 01:13:29.646
- That is not fair. I am-

939
01:13:29.784 --> 01:13:33.788
- You want to know
what's bothering me?

940
01:13:33.926 --> 01:13:35.618
All right. here it is.

941
01:13:37.274 --> 01:13:41.831
I have fucking had it

942
01:13:41.969 --> 01:13:45.110
with hearing
about your daughter!

943
01:13:45.248 --> 01:13:47.871
Okay? She's dead!

944
01:13:48.009 --> 01:13:49.908
My father. dead.

945
01:13:50.046 --> 01:13:53.739
And the last thing that I
ever want to talk about again

946
01:13:53.877 --> 01:13:55.189
is either one of them.

947
01:13:55.327 --> 01:13:58.710
I don't care.

948
01:13:58.848 --> 01:14:02.023
I just want to be left alone.

949
01:14:03.887 --> 01:14:06.234
starting right fucking now.

950
01:14:06.372 --> 01:14:10.204
I just want to be
left alone. so get out!

951
01:14:12.137 --> 01:14:13.690
I said. get out!

952
01:14:16.037 --> 01:14:19.662
- Please. I think we need
to get you away from here.

953
01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:22.112
- You better leave. Andre.

954
01:14:22.250 --> 01:14:24.667
before something
really bad happens.

955
01:14:25.875 --> 01:14:28.533
- You are losing it. Monica.

956
01:14:31.018 --> 01:14:34.021
- Whatever I lost.
I lost a long time ago.

957
01:14:34.159 --> 01:14:36.679
There ain't
nothing left for me to lose.

958
01:14:36.817 --> 01:14:38.646
Why don't you get out

959
01:14:39.785 --> 01:14:41.580
before you really piss me off?

960
01:14:44.583 --> 01:14:45.653
Get out!

961
01:14:54.662 --> 01:14:56.284
[Monica laughs]

962
01:14:56.422 --> 01:14:58.632
Should leave this place.

963
01:14:59.529 --> 01:15:00.634
Got that right.

964
01:15:02.636 --> 01:15:06.225
Losing it.
You got that right. too.

965
01:15:11.576 --> 01:15:13.785
- [Monica's Dad] Monica!

966
01:15:19.584 --> 01:15:20.654
Monica!

967
01:15:22.034 --> 01:15:24.899
I know you can hear me. Monica!

968
01:15:28.593 --> 01:15:31.699
- No. she didn't
threaten me directly.

969
01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:35.047
Listen. I am
really worried about her.

970
01:15:35.185 --> 01:15:37.912
You got to understand. this
is not like her at all.

971
01:15:39.017 --> 01:15:41.053
- Well. I'm sure it isn't.

972
01:15:42.192 --> 01:15:43.193
What did I say?

973
01:15:44.022 --> 01:15:47.059
Not everyone handles
extreme emotional distress

974
01:15:47.197 --> 01:15:48.613
the way you do.

975
01:15:48.751 --> 01:15:51.547
Most people wouldn't be able
to handle something like this.

976
01:15:53.134 --> 01:15:55.689
- Yeah. well.
not this time. all right?

977
01:15:55.827 --> 01:15:57.553
I mean. somebody
needs to check on her.

978
01:15:57.691 --> 01:16:01.384
but it's
obvious I can't be there.

979
01:16:01.522 --> 01:16:04.007
Donna. you should've seen
the look in her eyes.

980
01:16:04.939 --> 01:16:08.356
- Look. just give her
some time to cool off.

981
01:16:09.841 --> 01:16:13.327
But a word of advice. get
her out of that house.

982
01:16:14.259 --> 01:16:15.916
- Do me a favor. Can you
stick by your phone. though?

983
01:16:16.054 --> 01:16:18.746
Because I'm probably going
to need to call you again.

984
01:16:18.884 --> 01:16:21.197
Okay. thanks. Bye.

985
01:16:25.788 --> 01:16:31.000
Goddammit.

986
01:16:33.554 --> 01:16:34.624
- [Monica's Dad] Monica!

987
01:16:40.354 --> 01:16:43.115
- They think
the raven is in the safe.

988
01:16:43.253 --> 01:16:46.394
but you take your chances
and you drink your tea.

989
01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:51.883
Seven doors in Daddy's
room. It's New Year's Eve.

[door knocking]

991
01:17:03.066 --> 01:17:05.103
- Please. hey! I need you!

992
01:17:06.449 --> 01:17:08.693
Can you hear me? Hello!

993
01:17:12.351 --> 01:17:15.838
- Hi there. Is everything
okay there. Miss?

994
01:17:16.597 --> 01:17:18.806
- I believe so. Why?

995
01:17:18.944 --> 01:17:21.050
- I thought I heard some-

996
01:17:21.188 --> 01:17:23.673
- Do you want to
come in for a drink?

997
01:17:23.811 --> 01:17:29.023
- A drink sounds lovely.

998
01:17:33.476 --> 01:17:35.305
- Please. I need you!

999
01:17:38.067 --> 01:17:43.037
- Please. no tears. Such
a waste of good humanity.

1000
01:17:46.282 --> 01:17:49.043
[wine sloshing]

1001
01:17:59.088 --> 01:18:00.089
- Andre.

1002
01:18:02.263 --> 01:18:03.230
He left.

1003
01:18:06.336 --> 01:18:08.131
- I'm sure he'll be all right.

1004
01:18:09.995 --> 01:18:13.240
- He went a little mad.

1005
01:18:13.378 --> 01:18:18.590
- Well. we all go a little
bit mad sometimes. Maybe...

1006
01:18:19.591 --> 01:18:21.904
Maybe he needed to
blow off some steam.

1007
01:18:27.944 --> 01:18:32.121
- We all need to blow off
a little steam sometimes.

1008
01:18:33.087 --> 01:18:34.399
- I don't want to do anything-

1009
01:18:34.537 --> 01:18:38.127
- Upstairs. First
door on the right.

1010
01:18:39.991 --> 01:18:41.751
- Don't get me killed. now.

1011
01:18:46.825 --> 01:18:48.724
- [Monica's Dad] Monica!

1012
01:18:48.862 --> 01:18:50.864
- If you know
how to help Monica.

1013
01:18:51.002 --> 01:18:54.177
you have to tell me. all right?

1014
01:18:54.315 --> 01:18:58.043
Otherwise. anything that
I've ever said to her

1015
01:18:58.181 --> 01:19:01.978
or felt for her. it's not
going to mean a thing.

1016
01:19:02.116 --> 01:19:04.256
- It's too late
for that now. Andre.

1017
01:19:04.394 --> 01:19:06.051
- No. it isn't!

1018
01:19:07.881 --> 01:19:11.160
- It is. Andre.

1019
01:19:11.298 --> 01:19:12.195
- Please.

1020
01:19:13.265 --> 01:19:14.819
- When you revisit bad memories.

1021
01:19:14.957 --> 01:19:17.476
it makes it easy
for doors to open.

1022
01:19:17.614 --> 01:19:19.616
Monica is
a conduit which can be used

1023
01:19:19.755 --> 01:19:22.309
to unlock certain evils.

1024
01:19:22.447 --> 01:19:23.620
- Come on.

1025
01:19:23.759 --> 01:19:27.555
- Monica was the key.
She unlocked the door.

1026
01:19:27.693 --> 01:19:29.212
She let them out.

1027
01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:32.388
- Who? What are
you even talking about?

1028
01:19:32.526 --> 01:19:35.805
Why can't you just say
something that I can understand?

1029
01:19:35.943 --> 01:19:38.428
- I will be leaving soon. Andre.

1030
01:19:39.153 --> 01:19:42.536
I am prepared.
I warrant. for this world.

1031
01:19:44.055 --> 01:19:46.229
- No. you have to tell me.

1032
01:19:46.989 --> 01:19:48.128
How do I help her?

1033
01:19:49.646 --> 01:19:50.924
- Shall I tell him?

1034
01:19:52.511 --> 01:19:53.374
- Please.

1035
01:20:01.210 --> 01:20:03.868
[belt jingling]

1036
01:20:04.006 --> 01:20:07.043
- Fee. fi. fo. fum.

1037
01:20:08.251 --> 01:20:11.841
I spell the blood
of an Englishman.

1038
01:20:11.979 --> 01:20:14.361
[Dorian chuckles]

1039
01:20:14.499 --> 01:20:17.053
- The luck of
the Irish strikes again.

1040
01:20:22.162 --> 01:20:25.268
- 016 millennium. a beginning.

1041
01:20:26.304 --> 01:20:29.479
The universe was empty and
darkness covered the void.

1042
01:20:30.273 --> 01:20:31.688
But the void wasn't empty.

1043
01:20:31.827 --> 01:20:36.555
It was filled with entities.
creatures. monsters.

1044
01:20:36.693 --> 01:20:38.488
That is. until the Father
stepped forth and said.

1045
01:20:38.626 --> 01:20:40.870
let there be
light. banishing the dark

1046
01:20:41.008 --> 01:20:44.909
and the entities within it
behind seven locked doors.

1047
01:20:45.047 --> 01:20:48.153
wherein which this
existence and the beyond

1048
01:20:48.291 --> 01:20:50.121
may remain separated.

1049
01:20:51.777 --> 01:20:53.020
Only through influential keys

1050
01:20:53.158 --> 01:20:56.127
on both sides can
those doors be opened.

1051
01:20:57.473 --> 01:20:59.613
Fast forward 16.6 millennia.

1052
01:21:00.925 --> 01:21:06.275
Four of those doors are open.
and the fifth one is opening.

[ominous music]

1054
01:21:12.488 --> 01:21:15.629

happened to your eyes?
