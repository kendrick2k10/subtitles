Claire. if you could say
one thing

3
00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:08.842
to all the viewers at home
watching...

5
00:00:08.884 --> 00:00:10.511
what would you want
to say to them?

6
00:00:24.483 --> 00:00:26.276
Construction.

7
00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:29.279
We can't hear you. I mean.
we can't hear it. Don't worry.

8
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.412
Even if we can hear it.
doesn't matter.

9
00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:45.796
Do you believe in Astrology?

10
00:00:57.307 --> 00:00:59.685
Yeah. dude. Yeah. yeah. yeah.

11
00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:01.353
Don't worry. don't overthink it.

12
00:01:01.395 --> 00:01:02.604
Just be natural.

13
00:01:02.646 --> 00:01:04.397
Just be natural. okay?

14
00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:35.971
You want me to stop recording?

15
00:03:15.988 --> 00:03:19.116
Um. does your family...
so. does he support you a lot?

16
00:03:24.288 --> 00:03:26.832
So your dad only supports you
financially?

17
00:03:26.874 --> 00:03:28.750
And you don't consider that
to be support?

18
00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:52.524
But you don't want to try?

19
00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:32.564
You know. it's funny.
'cause Tony Robbins

20
00:04:32.606 --> 00:04:35.817
isn't really seen as
a spiritual teacher.

21
00:06:09.995 --> 00:06:11.371
I think you have to lock up.

22
00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:30.516
It's pretty cool you have
your own elevator.

23
00:06:45.197 --> 00:06:47.324
Are you excited that you're
making your documentary?

24
00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:51.912
I think it will.

25
00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.246
You're 75% from North America?

26
00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:08.794
I'm so confused.

27
00:11:08.836 --> 00:11:11.380
So there's Southeast Asians.
there's Indians...

28
00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:14.508
And then this is the culture
of North America?

29
00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:20.889
I really think
I'm missing something.

30
00:11:24.726 --> 00:11:26.520
You're not a Buddhist. are you?

31
00:11:43.662 --> 00:11:47.499
So you're 72% Native American
is what you're saying?

32
00:11:47.541 --> 00:11:49.251
Okay. cool.

33
00:13:52.875 --> 00:13:54.918
I think he's just sitting there.

34
00:13:58.922 --> 00:14:01.300
Okay.

35
00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:03.427
I'm gonna get across the street.
okay?

36
00:16:21.648 --> 00:16:23.692
Claire?

37
00:16:23.734 --> 00:16:25.903
Come here. sorry.

38
00:16:25.944 --> 00:16:27.446
Um...

39
00:16:27.487 --> 00:16:29.072
No. no. uh...

40
00:16:29.114 --> 00:16:30.908
Zen Buddhism isn't really
Chinese. like...

41
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:32.910
You said that you were looking
for a Chinese Buddhist Temple.

42
00:16:32.951 --> 00:16:35.579
But. like.
if you're looking for...

43
00:16:35.621 --> 00:16:36.997
Like. Zen is Japanese.

44
00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:39.791
I mean. I'm just
supposed to observe.

45
00:16:39.833 --> 00:16:42.711
But I didn't want you to
be embarrassed again.

46
00:16:42.753 --> 00:16:44.755
I don't get embarrassed.

47
00:18:10.257 --> 00:18:13.010
So let's say
you attain enlightenment.

48
00:18:14.887 --> 00:18:17.764
You're very close to it?

49
00:18:17.806 --> 00:18:20.017
Okay. so. you...

50
00:18:20.058 --> 00:18:22.561
Can you feel --

51
00:18:22.603 --> 00:18:25.272
You're close to it?

52
00:18:25.314 --> 00:18:27.524
The enlightenment?

53
00:18:31.695 --> 00:18:34.865
What does it look like?

54
00:21:50.018 --> 00:21:52.604
I think you still have
my mic pack.

55
00:21:55.232 --> 00:21:58.902
No. yeah.
but we need the mic pack.

56
00:21:58.944 --> 00:22:01.738
Yeah.

57
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.491
Not when we're asleep.
I have to charge the battery.

58
00:29:22.387 --> 00:29:24.598
Does that work?

59
00:29:37.236 --> 00:29:39.154
I'm just gonna come down.

60
00:29:42.074 --> 00:29:43.784
No. I got this.

61
00:30:18.986 --> 00:30:20.904
I don't know if I really see it
that well.

62
00:31:22.716 --> 00:31:24.426
Claire?

63
00:31:24.468 --> 00:31:28.138
So. source. right? Does she mean
where it comes from?

64
00:31:32.351 --> 00:31:34.436
So you see that waterfall
over there?

65
00:31:34.478 --> 00:31:37.856
That's probably...
where it comes from.

66
00:31:37.898 --> 00:31:39.191
Up this way.

67
00:31:43.695 --> 00:31:45.447
Uh. 'cause it comes from
a high place.

68
00:31:45.489 --> 00:31:48.033
'Cause. you know.
gravity and shit.

69
00:32:00.796 --> 00:32:02.089
Thank you!

70
00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:54.057
It's been a while now.

71
00:33:02.524 --> 00:33:04.109
No. sorry.

72
00:33:04.151 --> 00:33:06.403
I mean. yeah. uh. no. good.

73
00:33:06.445 --> 00:33:08.488
Wait -- wait -- wait for me!

74
00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:11.825
Okay. Claire. maybe...

75
00:33:15.245 --> 00:33:16.663
Yeah. but...

76
00:33:16.705 --> 00:33:17.664
It doesn't matt--

77
00:33:17.706 --> 00:33:19.666
[inaudible falling sounds]

78
00:33:47.861 --> 00:33:49.613
Is it safe? Are you good?

79
00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:54.868
Yeah. I smell it too.

80
00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:56.870
Looks pretty nice over there.

81
00:34:14.429 --> 00:34:16.431
Alright. Claire. hear me out.

82
00:34:20.393 --> 00:34:22.855
I don't think this is real.

83
00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:26.817
I don't mean to talk shit
about Bliss yet again.

84
00:34:26.859 --> 00:34:28.652
But just let me say this.

85
00:34:28.694 --> 00:34:30.946
What if...

86
00:34:30.987 --> 00:34:32.489
She's not here.

87
00:35:19.536 --> 00:35:23.874
Being honest with yourself
is not defending yourself.

88
00:35:23.916 --> 00:35:25.626
You're not being attacked.

89
00:36:30.649 --> 00:36:32.442
I'm not pulling you
away from change.

90
00:36:32.484 --> 00:36:35.070
like. the change
can stay and be real.

91
00:36:36.238 --> 00:36:37.656
No. I'm not.

92
00:37:24.119 --> 00:37:25.913
Claire. c'mon.

93
00:37:27.915 --> 00:37:29.625
It's...she...

94
00:37:29.666 --> 00:37:32.878
I don't think this is...maybe...

95
00:38:22.469 --> 00:38:24.304
I'm sorry. Claire.

96
00:41:02.838 --> 00:41:04.381
Don't move it yourself.

97
00:49:47.654 --> 00:49:49.448
Why are you anxious?

98
00:54:51.124 --> 00:54:54.503
Did what Guru Ben tell you
kinda mess you up?

99
00:54:55.838 --> 00:54:57.339
Guru Ben.

100
01:00:31.715 --> 01:00:33.842
You're doing a great job.

101
01:00:41.099 --> 01:00:43.018
Uh. yeah. sure.

102
01:00:46.438 --> 01:00:47.981
Talking.

103
01:00:48.023 --> 01:00:50.400
Yeah. Claire told me to tell you
she'll be here soon.

104
01:07:24.294 --> 01:07:27.214
I'll get some. uh...

105
01:07:27.256 --> 01:07:29.967
Some B shots. I'll get some...
some. yeah.

106
01:14:31.221 --> 01:14:35.767
I think I...

107
01:14:35.809 --> 01:14:39.438
(sigh)

108
01:14:39.479 --> 01:14:43.942
I know a guy. who might.
like. could help.

109
01:14:48.697 --> 01:14:52.451
He owns an art gallery.
but. like...

110
01:14:52.492 --> 01:14:54.536
He also helps people.

111
01:15:00.042 --> 01:15:02.169
He's. uh...

112
01:15:07.174 --> 01:15:10.677
Yeah. yeah. kinda like a doctor.
he. um...

113
01:15:10.719 --> 01:15:13.847
He gets drugs. but. like.
good ones. like. um...

114
01:15:13.889 --> 01:15:15.349
Like [censored]

115
01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:16.391
And [censored]

116
01:15:16.433 --> 01:15:18.852
And like [censored]

117
01:15:18.894 --> 01:15:20.312
Do you wanna?

118
01:15:23.774 --> 01:15:26.818
I mean. you said ego death.
so it made me think about it.

119
01:15:53.846 --> 01:15:55.389
Let's do it.

120
01:15:59.393 --> 01:16:00.894
Alright. let's do it.

121
01:16:00.936 --> 01:16:02.479
Yeah. I'm sure.

122
01:16:02.521 --> 01:16:04.314
Yeah.

123
01:16:11.071 --> 01:16:13.115
If you. yeah. well. I don't know
if he's available right now.

124
01:16:13.156 --> 01:16:14.741
But. yeah. we'll --
