3
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.943
- Hey. Pete.

4
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.026
check the GPS. what's that thing called?

5
00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:56.159
- It's not on there.

6
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.423
As far as the GPS is concerned.
this location doesn't exist.

7
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.430
- That that is so weird

8
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.795
and intriguing. I might add.

9
00:01:07.796 --> 00:01:09.379
- Okay.

10
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.380
Look. all in favor of not
exploring this super creepy.

11
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.849
non-existent haunted house.

12
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:17.927
Say I.

13
00:01:17.928 --> 00:01:18.760
- I.

14
00:01:18.761 --> 00:01:19.669
- What?

15
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.279
Whitney. you wanted to
go on this adventure

16
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.723
more than anyone.

17
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.836
Are you telling me. you are
not the least bit curious?

18
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.123
- I am sure it's gonna be fine.

19
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.939
We'll stick together. large groups.

20
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.530
safety in numbers. all that.

21
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.039
- They teach you that in Girl Scouts. Liz?

22
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.393
- Knock it off. Alex. I'm game.

23
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.609
Don't get too excited. Lily.

24
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.303
chances are we won't see a thing.

25
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.589
10 minutes of walking through here.

26
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.023
you'll be bored to tears.

27
00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.560
- Huh.

28
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.109
Well. who's with me?

29
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.409
Don't worry everybody.

30
00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.193
my flashlight doubles as a taser.

31
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.053
Okay. this is creepy.

32
00:04:42.402 --> 00:04:45.256
Maybe. maybe. we'll see a ghost.

33
00:04:45.257 --> 00:04:47.869
The ghost of Michael Jackson.

34
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.263
Oh my God. shut up.

35
00:04:49.264 --> 00:04:50.320
My gosh.

36
00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:53.049
So creepy. I love it.

37
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.709
If anybody jumps out.

38
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.343
I'm gonna hit him over the head.

39
00:05:12.346 --> 00:05:15.096
Oh. this is so creepy. I love it.

40
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.758
We're all gonna die.

41
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.360
Speak for yourself. Girl Scout.

42
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.433
Hey guys. are you
sure we should be doing this?

43
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.913
You're not afraid. are you?

44
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.209
Of course. I'm afraid.

45
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.739
What's there to be afraid of.

46
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.469
It's just an old empty house.

47
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.809
That's exactly
why we should be afraid.

48
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.653
It never just an old empty house.

49
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.099
Guys. has anyone noticed
that Peter and Cody

50
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.393
aren't with us anymore?

51
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.959
I'm they'll catch up.

52
00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.446
Fraidy cats taking up the rear as usual.

53
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.633
Oh my God. who's that?

54
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.620
Who is that?

55
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.774
Hello. what's your name?

56
00:06:40.084 --> 00:06:42.334
Don't talk
to her. she's a ghost.

57
00:06:56.377 --> 00:06:57.209
Gotta find her.
- No.

58
00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.360
- Gotta find her.
- No. don't go in there.

59
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:01.793
Whitney.

60
00:07:01.794 --> 00:07:02.794
Whitney.

61
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.349
It's gonna be okay guys.

62
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:09.292
It's not gonna be okay.

63
00:07:09.293 --> 00:07:11.549
Ghosts are gonna kill us.

64
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.329
Okay. this probably

65
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.119
wasn't such a good idea. after all.

66
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.573
I'm partially to blame.

67
00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.299
Partially.

68
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.050
Hurry up and find the light switch.

69
00:07:34.457 --> 00:07:37.839
I can't believe we saw a ghost.

70
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.083
What were you expect to see?

71
00:07:40.084 --> 00:07:41.659
I don't know.

72
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.923
Maybe like bugs or rats or something.

73
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.183
Maybe Michael Jackson.

74
00:07:48.408 --> 00:07:49.689
I wanna go home.

75
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.327
Lily. I wanna go home.

76
00:07:52.328 --> 00:07:54.913
Shh. just stay with me.

77
00:07:56.056 --> 00:07:59.305
Why can't we ever
run into friendly ghosts?

78
00:08:12.811 --> 00:08:13.867
Oh my God.

79
00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:14.868
Oh my God.

80
00:08:15.867 --> 00:08:18.200
What happened to the lights.

81
00:08:32.728 --> 00:08:34.478
Oh no. not again. no.

82
00:08:44.433 --> 00:08:46.516
Alex. don't go. don't go.

83
00:09:01.734 --> 00:09:04.041
Alex. are you okay?

84
00:09:04.042 --> 00:09:05.623
- [Alex[ I'm Fine.

85
00:09:11.673 --> 00:09:13.539
What happened?

86
00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.013
Nothing. nothing. I'm fine.

87
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.809
If the sign
says. keep out. guys.

88
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:38.217
I've learned. you probably should.

89
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.289
Tell me. Liz.

90
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.767
what would the Girl Scouts
do in this situation?

91
00:10:20.366 --> 00:10:21.898
Guys.

92
00:10:24.728 --> 00:10:27.308
Guys. this isn't funny.

93
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:16.588
- Hey you.

94
00:13:16.589 --> 00:13:17.421
- Hey.

95
00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:19.659
- I am not approachable right now.

96
00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.929
I just ran and I'm super sweaty.

97
00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:22.762
- Oh. whatever.

98
00:13:22.763 --> 00:13:24.423
I haven't shaved in four days.

99
00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.109
So what's up.

100
00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:33.119
Sorry. I got your message.

101
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.179
I could have come picked you up if.

102
00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:36.669
- No. it's okay.

103
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.939
I actually like to jog.

104
00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.749
It helps when my mind is racing

105
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:45.449
and just helps clear my mind.

106
00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.773
Car rides don't really
do that for me as much.

107
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:52.163
- Yeah. well. sounds like
you got a lot on your mind.

108
00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:59.260
- I would just like to keep
this between me and you.

109
00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:03.439
As much as I know and respect
the guys on your team.

110
00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.309
I just would like to out a little bit more

111
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:08.159
and keep it on the DL.

112
00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.273
I don't wanna cry wolf too soon.

113
00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:12.469
If that's okay.

114
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:13.920
- Of course. babe. what's up?

115
00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:20.663
- So my sister has been
missing for two days.

116
00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:24.669
She left Friday morning

117
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:27.319
to go to a sleepover at her friend's house

118
00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.109
before the Taylor Swift
concert on Saturday.

119
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:32.293
And that's the last I heard from her.

120
00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:34.740
- I see.

121
00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:38.189
And I'm sure you talked to this.

122
00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:40.599
whatever best friend and her family.

123
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.600
- Yeah.

124
00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:45.159
Three hours after Lily arrived.

125
00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.759
her and Alex went to
go grab a bite to eat.

126
00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.979
their friend. Liz. her mom. Debbie.

127
00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:52.669
owns that diner on the outskirts of town.

128
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:55.846
Liz said that they
actually FaceTimed her mom

129
00:14:55.847 --> 00:14:59.009
while they were sitting at
a booth at the restaurant.

130
00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:01.253
But Deb said that they never showed up.

131
00:15:05.969 --> 00:15:06.969
- Go on.

132
00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.479
- Alex's mom said that she
tried to get in touch with Alex.

133
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.529
but to no avail.

134
00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:15.573
So that's when she called the police.

135
00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:20.949
This would be the third time

136
00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:23.459
that my sister has tried
to run away from home.

137
00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:24.979
She got involved with this guy

138
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.199
that my mom did not approve of.

139
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:31.013
And he actually talked her
into running away twice.

140
00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.649
So. Alex is the only one

141
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:37.949
that my mom lets Lily
hang out with anymore.

142
00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:41.759
And the police say that Alex
might actually be the one

143
00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.143
that talked Lily into running away again.

144
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:46.903
Alex's mom doesn't think so.

145
00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:51.799
And the police tried to assure me

146
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.519
that White County is
the safest in the state.

147
00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.019
There's never been any
kind of sex trafficking

148
00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.639
or there hasn't been an abduction

149
00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:03.263
in 22 years or something
like that. oh gosh.

150
00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:07.889
The police said that
they'll keep an eye out.

151
00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:12.193
but that they think they'll
just show up when they want to.

152
00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:17.170
- I'm sorry.

153
00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:25.273
And obviously you think
that's not the case with her.

154
00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:31.373
- Yeah. but. I seem to be
the only one who thinks so.

155
00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:33.350
- Yeah.

156
00:16:35.568 --> 00:16:38.039
Well it's been a long time
since I've had a case like this.

157
00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.302
but you know. I'm in.

158
00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:43.920
- Thank you.

159
00:16:44.741 --> 00:16:45.926
- Of course.

160
00:16:47.366 --> 00:16:49.873
- So where do we start?

161
00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:53.499
Well. first off
we would need to start

162
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.819
by searching Lily's room.

163
00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.809
anything that would indicate any plans

164
00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:59.299
of where she might want to disappear to.

165
00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.099
Same with Alex.

166
00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:05.239
Facebook posts. Instagram. any
kind of social media hints.

167
00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.029
diaries. if she kept one.

168
00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:09.329
And we also need to find
out the name of this boy

169
00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:11.829
that she had contact with.

170
00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:13.309
Those are our first steps.

171
00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:14.142
Perfect.

172
00:17:14.143 --> 00:17:15.800
I believe mom said his name was Cody.

173
00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:17.950
Any last name?

174
00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:22.089
Evers. I think.

175
00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:24.369
Oh. he has a sister that
has a place near here.

176
00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:26.049
we can check with.

177
00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:28.388
Cool. let's do some digging.

178
00:18:39.389 --> 00:18:41.919
- They're always together.

179
00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.369
They never get in trouble.

180
00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:45.669
I just. I really have no reason

181
00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:48.079
to think that something happened to them.

182
00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.853
but it's been I three whole days.

183
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:57.649
- All right. so. you
said that your sisters

184
00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:59.959
were with a group of friends.

185
00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.693
including her sister. right?

186
00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:04.249
- That's the impression I was under.

187
00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:06.039
I mean. they were bored with life

188
00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.289
and they wanted to go find some kicks.

189
00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:11.389
So they went with her
sister and their friends

190
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:15.929
and off into the mysterious
beyonds. I don't know.

191
00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:17.803
- This all doesn't make any sense.

192
00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.599
- Okay. did your sisters
let you know by chance

193
00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.083
where they were headed?

194
00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:29.259
Okay. well. we do have some leads.

195
00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:33.003
but it would be very helpful
if we knew the destination.

196
00:19:34.288 --> 00:19:37.039
I'm sure you talked to
the police already. right?

197
00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.923
- Yeah. they're investigating.

198
00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:43.882
But I had no more to tell them
than I've already told you.

199
00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:49.519
- Well. I mean. it's not much to go on.

200
00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.333
but we're gonna do the best we can.

201
00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:57.529
- Please let us know the
second you hear from them.

202
00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:58.439
You bet.

203
00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.869
Thank you.

204
00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:00.815
- It's nice to meet you.

205
00:20:00.816 --> 00:20:01.936
- Nice to meet you.

206
00:20:01.937 --> 00:20:03.703
- It was so nice to meet you.

207
00:20:18.326 --> 00:20:20.283
I told you there was something to this.

208
00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.899
Hey Mom. this is Joel.

209
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.033
- Ms. Decker. my name is Joel Townsend.

210
00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:41.499
I work for the Sheriff's Department.

211
00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.559
Jackie here just felt that

212
00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.733
maybe I should come take
a look at the place.

213
00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.979
- Well. I just finished a workout.

214
00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:51.280
Come on in. let me change.

215
00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:53.902
- Go ahead.

216
00:20:53.903 --> 00:20:54.903
Thank you.

217
00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:04.049
- I don't know what you expect to find.

218
00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:07.319
The police have already
searched the whole room. but.

219
00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.739
- Well. yeah. but they
probably weren't convinced

220
00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:11.869
they needed to do a good job.

221
00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:12.919
If I may?

222
00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:13.920
- Go ahead.

223
00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.269
I really hope she doesn't
come home this time.

224
00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:29.529
I'm ready to whip her ass.

225
00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:32.159
If she does. if she comes
home. I'm whipping her ass.

226
00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.613
- You don't mean that. Mom.

227
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:36.110
- I know but.

228
00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:40.829
I give her everything.
everything. everything I do.

229
00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:41.879
I go to work every day.

230
00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:45.499
I give her everything a
19-year-old girl could want.

231
00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.599
And she's done this to me three times.

232
00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.216
Why?

233
00:21:50.217 --> 00:21:51.425
- I don't know. Mom.

234
00:21:51.426 --> 00:21:53.039
I'm not sure what's going on.

235
00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.790
but maybe it's different this time.

236
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:59.309
Let's just wait until we
find out what's going on

237
00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:00.623
to get upset.

238
00:23:46.651 --> 00:23:48.512
- Did you find anything?

239
00:24:05.384 --> 00:24:07.156
Did you find anything?

240
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.563
- I'm not sure.

241
00:24:33.225 --> 00:24:34.225
Thank you.

242
00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:40.623
- Yeah. I'm sure.

243
00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:42.747
he went out with her.

244
00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:46.793
Geez. he's obsessed with that girl. okay.

245
00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.209
- Are you sure they went out to dinner?

246
00:24:56.210 --> 00:25:00.093
- Well. yeah. at least
that's what he told me.

247
00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:05.069
- So the plan was for Cody and Lily

248
00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:08.445
to go on a date together
with Alex tagging along.

249
00:25:08.446 --> 00:25:13.299
- Yeah. that sounds kind of
third wheel. if you ask me.

250
00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:16.689
- Well. I mean. from what I understand.

251
00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:18.759
she asked her friend to come
along for the first time.

252
00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.193
so it wasn't uncomfortable.

253
00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:23.703
- Right. right. okay.

254
00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:30.813
Okay. what kind of person
would you say your brother is?

255
00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:39.260
- Well. he's kind of a wild kid.

256
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:41.702
Don't get me wrong.

257
00:25:41.703 --> 00:25:45.359
I don't pretend to keep up with
all the ladies in his life.

258
00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.249
That's his gig. it's not on my business.

259
00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:52.083
but I mean. he is a good kid.

260
00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.893
- All the ladies in his life?

261
00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:59.783
- I mean. he's a pretty good looking guy.

262
00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:03.277
Don't tell him I said that though.

263
00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.083
- Well. where is Cody now?

264
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:12.559
- I don't know.

265
00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.503
Probably still hanging out with that girl.

266
00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:20.099
- Lily's missing.

267
00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.849
And if they were together.

268
00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:24.893
we were hoping you might
know where they were.

269
00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.160
- Sure.

270
00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:33.563
No. no. I haven't talked
to Cody since yesterday.

271
00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:39.019
You guys are kind of
starting to worry me now.

272
00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:40.099
- There's no need to worry.

273
00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:41.463
No need to get upset.

274
00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:45.889
We're just trying to cover
all bases at this point.

275
00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:49.179
Okay. we really don't know what to do.

276
00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:52.659
- If you do hear from Cody.
we would really appreciate it.

277
00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:55.629
if you let us know as soon as possible.

278
00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:56.663
- Yeah. of course.

279
00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:03.163
- Will you also. let me
know if you hear from Lily?

280
00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:07.053
- Of course. absolutely.

281
00:27:28.854 --> 00:27:30.419
- Here you go. guys.

282
00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.343
Are you sure that she said
she was here that night?

283
00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.570
- The Instagram post says
the day and time it was taken

284
00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:44.603
and was clearly here.

285
00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:47.349
- That's weird.

286
00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:49.679
The manager checked the
footage from that night

287
00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.171
and she never came in.

288
00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:00.479
Let me know if you guys
need anything else. okay.

289
00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.423
- Of course. Chels. thanks.

290
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.428
Now what?

291
00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.709
- Well. as far as I'm concerned.

292
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:12.403
there's only one thing left to do.

293
00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.253
Well. tomorrow's another day.

294
00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:42.840
- I know.

295
00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:46.033
This is just so unlike her.

296
00:28:47.015 --> 00:28:48.619
I mean. her and Mom didn't get in a fight.

297
00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:50.419
as far as I'm aware.

298
00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:54.199
and she played it safe by
going on that first date

299
00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.363
with Alex being there.

300
00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:58.843
I just don't get it.

301
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.659
That's all I can do. but assume the worst.

302
00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:05.459
- Don't. don't. listen.
here's what we're gonna do.

303
00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:07.769
tomorrow. we're gonna put
posters up all over the city

304
00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:10.239
and of course we'll put
posts up on social media.

305
00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:12.079
One of two things is gonna happen.

306
00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:16.169
in a town this small. either
someone is going to find her

307
00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:18.179
or she herself will see the posters

308
00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:19.289
and know that you're looking for.

309
00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:21.369
and then she'll contact you. all right.

310
00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:22.370
Think positive.

311
00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:25.920
- Yeah. I will.

312
00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:34.543
- You. gonna be all right tonight?

313
00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.663
- Yes. I'll be fine.

314
00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.120
- All right.

315
00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:45.326
- I'll text you in the morning.

316
00:29:45.327 --> 00:29:46.327
- Okay.

317
00:32:52.724 --> 00:32:53.724
Morning.

318
00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:56.980
- Joel.

319
00:32:58.057 --> 00:32:59.057
I think.

320
00:33:01.294 --> 00:33:03.044
- What. what's wrong?

321
00:33:06.216 --> 00:33:08.613
- I dunno. I think Lily might be dead.

322
00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:27.593
- Okay. what are you basing this off of?

323
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:33.193
- I had a nightmare and I saw her

324
00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:42.660
and I just have this really weird feeling

325
00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:46.089
that something is really wrong.

326
00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:51.090
Like. something or someone.
maybe even Lily herself.

327
00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:54.397
is trying to tell me that she's dead.

328
00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:02.840
- Okay.

329
00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:06.150
Jackie.

330
00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:09.613
I know that we've both been
under a lot of stress recently.

331
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:13.759
I'm just worried that
you're letting your mind

332
00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.169
jump to conclusions that.

333
00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:18.299
- Don't get all scientific on me here.

334
00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:20.559
- Look. all I'm saying
is take it from someone

335
00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.709
who knows psychology. okay.

336
00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:26.209
You're letting your fear and
anxiety stir up your emotions

337
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:28.609
and your emotions are
compromising your mind

338
00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:31.049
and causing your mind
to jump to conclusions

339
00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:31.882
that go places that.

340
00:34:31.883 --> 00:34:34.059
- I know what I saw.

341
00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:39.029
- What you saw was the thing
that you're afraid of most.

342
00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:43.833
your sister possibly be
dead. alone. not coming back.

343
00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:47.379
I mean. let's be honest for just a second.

344
00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:50.380
we don't have any evidence to
support that right now. do we?

345
00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:54.870
Do we?

346
00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:58.763
I mean. do we?

347
00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.359
Okay.

348
00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.469
All right. so just. let's just
try to think through this.

349
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:09.979
So I've already posted on
Facebook that she's missing.

350
00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:11.429
Okay. so that's step number one.

351
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:12.839
When we're done with lunch here.

352
00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.249
we're gonna go out throughout the city.

353
00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:16.649
post all these photos

354
00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:18.639
and these posters that I made last night

355
00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:21.359
and these flyers all over town. all right.

356
00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:22.839
We'll spend a few hours doing that

357
00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.539

- Good. good. you look good.

379
00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.565
I thought I just saw.

380
00:39:40.566 --> 00:39:42.743
- Oh crap. are they here already?

381
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:47.563
- No. I thought I just saw my brother.

382
00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:49.789
- Your brother?

383
00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:51.290
Why the heck would he be here?

384
00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:55.729
He's not. forget I said that.

385
00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:56.730
It's no biggie.

386
00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:00.366
- You're nervous. aren't you?

387
00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:03.902
It's fine.

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:23.129
- Hey. it's me.

392
00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:24.029
I don't know why I called.

393
00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:28.819
I just. I was driving
over to my friend's house

394
00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:31.157
and I thought I saw something.

395
00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:33.270

396
00:40:38.352 --> 00:40:39.352

397
00:40:54.754 --> 00:40:56.637
- Where did you say you saw him again?

398
00:40:56.638 --> 00:40:58.403
- Right over there.

399
00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:28.010
- Nothing around here that I can see.

400
00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:34.530
- I could have sworn he was there.

401
00:41:35.975 --> 00:41:38.225
What was he doing?

402
00:41:39.293 --> 00:41:41.109
- Just staring.

403
00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:47.140
Jackie told me about her dream.

404
00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:59.847
- Man. we got some creepy ass
shit going on here. don't we?

405
00:42:03.151 --> 00:42:04.151

Boo.

Look at it. it's gorgeous.

435
00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:38.960
It reminds me of back home.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.049
We'll enjoy this.
- Thank you.

437
00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:45.563

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:49.799

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:58.407
- Hey. guys. lunch is gonna

443
00:44:06.632 --> 00:44:07.632
Lets go.

444
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.589
- Wow. that looks delicious.

445
00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:15.590
- Very delicious.

446
00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:19.119
Well ladies. please excuse me.

447
00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:21.375
When nature calls. Ali answers.

448
00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:26.406
- Ali. come on.

449
00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:01.400
- Holy.

450
00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:07.273
Hey. are you lost?

00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:25.653
- Honey. are you okay?

452
00:45:25.654 --> 00:45:27.103
- It's okay. it's okay.

453
00:45:28.310 --> 00:45:30.533
I think she's probably just lost.

454
00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:38.629
- Sweetie. look at her.

455
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:39.649
- Yeah.

456
00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:43.283
- It looks like she's
been beaten or worse.

457
00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:50.353
Hey there. do you wanna come out?

458
00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:58.513
It's okay. you're safe.
we're not gonna hurt you.

459
00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:07.209
Should we call the police?

460
00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:08.729
- What are we gonna tell 'em?

461
00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:10.419
They're gonna think we did this.

462
00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:13.049
I mean just some girl we just
find 50 miles outta town.

463
00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:14.050
like come on.

464
00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:16.500
- Sweetie. we have to do something.

465
00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:21.962
I don't know.

466
00:46:21.963 --> 00:46:24.381
- What's going on guys. what's happening?

467
00:46:24.382 --> 00:46:26.519
- We found a girl in the woods.

468
00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:28.563
It's like she's lost or something.

469
00:46:30.069 --> 00:46:33.843
- Wait. wait. I recognize this girl.

470
00:46:33.844 --> 00:46:34.899
- What?

471
00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:36.149
- Yeah.

472
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:39.739
- She's the missing girl
from the flyer we got.

473
00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:40.729
- Are you sure?

474
00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:42.874
- She is.
- Oh. what?

475
00:46:45.747 --> 00:46:48.219
- Is that her?

476
00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:49.052
- You know what?

477
00:46:49.053 --> 00:46:52.417
I think so.

478
00:46:52.418 --> 00:46:53.751
- That can't be.

479
00:47:14.141 --> 00:47:15.289
- Hello.

480
00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:16.493
- This is Jasmine.

481
00:47:17.848 --> 00:47:21.809
I'm calling because I
think we found the girl

482
00:47:21.810 --> 00:47:25.721
that is in the flyer. the missing girl.

483
00:47:29.538 --> 00:47:31.813
We're at the Fairburn Campgrounds.

484
00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:34.289
Okay.

485
00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:35.740
Okay. yeah. we can wait here.

486
00:47:55.002 --> 00:47:55.834
Are you Jackie?

487
00:47:55.835 --> 00:47:56.667
- Yeah. I'm Jackie.

488
00:47:56.668 --> 00:47:57.500
- Joel.
- My name is Ali.

489
00:47:57.501 --> 00:47:59.289

490
00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:00.189
- Nice to meet you.

491
00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:01.129

492
00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:02.189
Nice to meet you.
- Jasmine. you too.

493
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:03.089
- Where is she?

494
00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:04.019
Can you take me to her?

495
00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:05.670
- Yeah. she's over here. come on.

496
00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:10.749
- Hey. are you hungry?

497
00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:13.433
I just made some really good sandwiches.

498
00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:17.527
Here. you should take a bite.

499
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:20.190
It's really good.

500
00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:21.880
What's your name?

501
00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:24.540
It's okay.

502
00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:26.072
I'm your friend.

503
00:48:26.073 --> 00:48:28.261
It's really good. you should try some.

504
00:48:30.477 --> 00:48:32.209
- So she says she just showed up

505
00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:33.089
outta the middle of nowhere.

506
00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:34.999
- Dude. I swear. I was
out there taking a whiz

507
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.029
and she just comes outta nowhere.

508
00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:37.143
I have no idea.

509
00:48:38.585 --> 00:48:41.349
- 54.2 Miles outside of town.

510
00:48:41.350 --> 00:48:42.963
Never a dull moment in my job.

511
00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:45.089
- We were thinking about
calling the police.

512
00:48:45.090 --> 00:48:47.209
but one of our friends
recognized who she was

513
00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:48.799
and that's what led to you.

514
00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:49.789
- No. no. no. no. you did the right thing.

515
00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:51.796
you did the right thing.

516
00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:00.780
- Lily.

517
00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:02.819
where have you been?

518
00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:04.816
Come over here.

519
00:49:16.650 --> 00:49:17.650
- Oh.

520
00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:19.830
hey Jackie.

521
00:49:24.590 --> 00:49:26.403
What are you doing here?

522
00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:33.163
- Lily. where have you been?

523
00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:36.633
We've been searching for five days.

524
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:39.150
- Why?

525
00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:41.489
- Why?

526
00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:43.419
What do you mean. why?

527
00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:48.420
- I am 19. I should be able
to go off and do my own thing

528
00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:51.833
without being babysat all the time.

529
00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:53.900
- Oh my gosh.

530
00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:57.759
Without calling or texting

531
00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:00.233
or literally any kind of communication.

532
00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:04.853
You just don't know how
dangerous this world can be yet.

533
00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:07.883
Mom is worried sick.

534
00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:13.393
- Yeah. Mom is always worried.

535
00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:21.313
- Where is Cody?

536
00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.523
Don't lie to me. Lily.

537
00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:28.799
I know you've been seeing him.

538
00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:29.800
Where is he?

539
00:50:31.065 --> 00:50:36.065
- I don't know.

540
00:50:37.768 --> 00:50:39.209
- You don't know?

541
00:50:39.210 --> 00:50:41.160
Weren't you with him last Friday night?

542
00:50:43.170 --> 00:50:44.170
- Yeah.

543
00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:47.672
And then he went home.

544
00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:58.670
- What are we gonna do?

545
00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:04.659
- Just let her take a nap or something.

546
00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:07.063
She's obviously a little shaken up.

547
00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:12.839
Maybe you can try to
get the truth from her

548
00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:13.890
later tonight. maybe.

549
00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:31.290
- Hey.

550
00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:34.579
- So what's the verdict?

551
00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:37.729
- Well. it took her a
while to get it all out.

552
00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:41.159
but she said that she
left with Cody and Alex

553
00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:44.610
to go to dinner and then
she went to a concert

554
00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:48.663
and then she went to grab a late dinner.

555
00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:52.723
and then she stayed over at Cody's house.

556
00:51:54.510 --> 00:51:59.289
Yeah. it took me a while to
pull that one out of her.

557
00:51:59.290 --> 00:52:00.453
- Adventurous kid.

558
00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:03.239
So what did she have to say

559
00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:05.340
about where the rest of the gang was then?

560
00:52:07.371 --> 00:52:08.823
- She doesn't remember.

561
00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:21.741
- You know what?

562
00:52:21.742 --> 00:52:22.992
I have an idea.

563
00:52:31.210 --> 00:52:32.729
- Cheryl.

564
00:52:32.730 --> 00:52:33.730
Cheryl. no.

565
00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:39.388
Cheryl. Cheryl. no.

566
00:52:39.389 --> 00:52:42.339
Listen to me. Cheryl.

567
00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:43.419
Listen to me.

568
00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:46.399
You are a strong. independent woman.

569
00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:48.889
You will not take this sitting down.

570
00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:52.343
Not you. not any time. not ever.

571
00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:56.763
You listen to me.

572
00:52:57.650 --> 00:53:00.769
You are a strong. independent woman.

573
00:53:00.770 --> 00:53:03.889
You do not need to take any of this crap.

574
00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:06.473
Let me hear you say it.

575
00:53:07.307 --> 00:53:09.179
Cheryl. Cheryl. no.

576
00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:10.189
Let me hear you say it.

577
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:13.873
I am strong. independent woman.

578
00:53:19.770 --> 00:53:20.770
What's up bro?

579
00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:24.023
- Broski. what's up man?

580
00:53:28.176 --> 00:53:29.176
Oh.

581
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:33.426
- What's going on man?

582
00:53:33.427 --> 00:53:34.759
- What's up bro?

583
00:53:37.693 --> 00:53:40.276
1-800-HEALTH. please hold.

584
00:53:42.779 --> 00:53:44.263
1-800-DEFENSE.

585
00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:47.530
Please hold.

586
00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:50.893
1-800-HEALTH.

587
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.699
All of our psychologists are
board certified and accredited.

588
00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:57.654
I'll transfer you to one now.

589
00:54:00.645 --> 00:54:01.477
1-800-HEALTH.

590
00:54:01.478 --> 00:54:02.975
I need to talk
to somebody right now.

591
00:54:02.976 --> 00:54:04.489
- Well. why don't you
describe to me in a few words.

592
00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:05.812
what type of problems you're having?

593
00:54:05.813 --> 00:54:08.479
- I'm off my meds and I'm
really starting to freak out

594
00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.264
because I'm losing my mind. I can't.

595
00:54:10.265 --> 00:54:12.409
I don't know the right from
left. I'm seeing things.

596
00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:13.639
- What's going on. bro.

597
00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:16.475
You want some beer. you want some pizza?

598
00:54:16.476 --> 00:54:17.845
I came home the other day

599
00:54:17.846 --> 00:54:19.032
and I kinda just felt like
I was a different person.

600
00:54:19.033 --> 00:54:20.349
- You can keep the
pizza. I'll take a beer.

601
00:54:20.350 --> 00:54:21.182
Totally changed.

602
00:54:21.183 --> 00:54:23.920
Like sometimes I feel like
I'm a whole different.

603
00:54:23.921 --> 00:54:26.379
like I'm just this dark thing inside me

604
00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:28.759
and just starts coming out and
I don't even know who it is.

605
00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:30.309
I'm a totally different person.

606
00:54:30.310 --> 00:54:33.780
- So. what are you doing here. I mean?

607
00:54:33.781 --> 00:54:35.649
- Ah. well. call center

608
00:54:35.650 --> 00:54:36.599
sent me home a little bit earlier.

609
00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:37.763
I work later on.

610
00:54:39.047 --> 00:54:41.429
I don't think I'm gonna hang
onto this job longer anyway.

611
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:43.559
It sucks.

612
00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:44.949
- Gotcha. gotcha.

613
00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:45.782
I'm not gonna be able to do.

614
00:54:45.783 --> 00:54:47.280
- Yeah. I definitely understand.

615
00:54:49.153 --> 00:54:53.889
You. you're just gonna
leave her going like that?

616
00:54:53.890 --> 00:54:55.899
Nobody seems to
care that I'm losing my mind.

617
00:54:55.900 --> 00:54:57.027
- She'll be okay.

618
00:54:57.028 --> 00:54:57.860
I completely forgot.

619
00:54:57.861 --> 00:55:00.270
I got a call back 'cause
I left my keys in my car.

620
00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:03.853
- Just hang on one sec.

621
00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:06.439
1-800-HEALTH.

622
00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:07.919
Yes. I'd like to
schedule an appointment.

623
00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:10.199
- Well. let's set up an
appointment for you. Susan.

624
00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:12.413
Let's just get the rest
of your information down.

625
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:14.102
Okay.

626
00:55:14.103 --> 00:55:15.623
Susan Roberts.

627
00:55:17.053 --> 00:55:19.023
Oh.

628
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:22.769
Sorry. Susan looks like

629
00:55:22.770 --> 00:55:25.179
we can't make an appointment
for you right now.

630
00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:26.779
You can't make an appointment?

631
00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:27.719
Why can't you make an appointment?

632
00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:32.073
- Well. it appears that
your account is past due.

633
00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:34.279
And unfortunately we can't

634
00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:36.591
make any more appointments for you

635
00:55:36.592 --> 00:55:38.619
until you catch up on your bill.

636
00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:40.969
My bill is not past due.

637
00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:43.689
I've never paid a late
bill in my entire life.

638
00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:45.657
I can not believe anyone
would ever accuse me.

639
00:55:45.658 --> 00:55:47.837
- All right. so what's going on?

640
00:55:47.838 --> 00:55:48.838
- Well.

641
00:55:49.650 --> 00:55:52.019
In fact. I called
up last week to try to change.

642
00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:55.479
- Remember that favor
that you said you owed me

643
00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:56.671
from a while back?

644
00:55:56.672 --> 00:55:58.279
I dunno if that request was.

645
00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:02.095
- I knew you were gonna be
calling for that sooner or later.

646
00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:08.523
- Well. you know. I've
been seeing Jackie and.

647
00:56:09.530 --> 00:56:10.999
you know. a lot of stuff's been going on.

648
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.709
so I really could use your help.

649
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:15.929
I really need a big favor from you.

650
00:56:15.930 --> 00:56:18.519
- Hey. as long as it
isn't something illegal.

651
00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:20.043
immoral or unethical.

652
00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:22.329
I'm your man.

653
00:56:22.330 --> 00:56:23.162
It's just typical

654
00:56:23.163 --> 00:56:24.393
of the customer service nowadays.

655
00:56:24.394 --> 00:56:26.630
Is it even possible to
get good customer service?

656
00:56:26.631 --> 00:56:27.463
I don't even know anymore.

657
00:56:27.464 --> 00:56:29.519
I don't even think this is
right. you treat people.

658
00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:33.539
- Oh shit. turns out I've
actually done all three of those.

659
00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:35.234
Just call me on the line

660
00:56:35.235 --> 00:56:37.065
and dangle this little
carrot in front of my face.

661
00:56:37.066 --> 00:56:38.264
like I'm not paying my
bill when I totally am.

662
00:56:38.265 --> 00:56:39.265
- Hold on.

663
00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:46.269
Susan. absolutely. I
completely agree with you.

664
00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:47.969
My husband left me recently.

665
00:56:47.970 --> 00:56:50.634
- Your husband left you?

666
00:56:50.635 --> 00:56:52.227
That is terrible.

667
00:56:52.228 --> 00:56:53.228
I can't.

668
00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:57.692
I can't imagine what type of
pain you must be going through.

669
00:56:57.693 --> 00:56:58.930
He left me the other day.

670
00:56:58.931 --> 00:57:00.132
and he left Ralphie.

671
00:57:00.133 --> 00:57:02.966
- Ah. that's just awful. terrible.

672
00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:08.533
Susan. that is just terrible.

673
00:57:09.712 --> 00:57:11.149
And I feel
like. I have the right.

674
00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:12.039
- Yes. yes. Ma'am.

675
00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:13.323
To chose my own dishwasher.

676
00:57:13.324 --> 00:57:14.859
- Yes. Ma'am.
- A woman has the right

677
00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:16.513
to choose.
- Yes. Ma'am.

678
00:57:16.514 --> 00:57:19.055
It doesn't matter.

679
00:57:19.056 --> 00:57:22.279
- Yes. Ma'am. I completely agree

680
00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:24.138
with a woman's right to choose.

681
00:57:24.139 --> 00:57:25.421
Exactly. thank you.

682
00:57:25.422 --> 00:57:27.804
I have the right as well
to be my own person.

683
00:57:27.805 --> 00:57:30.089
- Absolutely. Ma'am.

684
00:57:30.090 --> 00:57:34.339
I completely agree with a
woman's right to choose.

685
00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:37.239
I'm frankly
tired of the patriarchy

686
00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:40.059
this chauvinistic undermining of woman.

687
00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:41.570
- Oh. absolutely.

688
00:57:41.571 --> 00:57:42.432
Thank you.

689
00:57:42.433 --> 00:57:44.449
Now are you gonna make appointment for me?

690
00:57:44.450 --> 00:57:45.450
- Nope.

691
00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:52.183
- Hey. to your job. man.

692
00:57:57.110 --> 00:57:58.693
- This never stops.

693
00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:00.989
1-800-HEALTH.

694
00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:03.439
I have an
issue with my boyfriend.

695
00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:06.162
- Why don't you explain to me
you what's going on. Ma'am.

696
00:58:06.163 --> 00:58:10.496
- I'm in love with him but
he doesn't appreciate me.

697
00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:14.819
- Dude. I gotta talk
to you about something.

698
00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:17.817
Takes from me
and he takes from me.

699
00:58:17.818 --> 00:58:19.429
- What's going on?

700
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:21.213
- Well. Britney split.

701
00:58:23.064 --> 00:58:25.263
I'm pretty sure she's gone this time.

702
00:58:27.179 --> 00:58:28.193
- Oh dude.

703
00:58:30.212 --> 00:58:32.542
I cook. I clean.

704
00:58:32.543 --> 00:58:34.579
- I think she really means it this time.

705
00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:37.056
- Ah. she always means it.

706
00:58:37.057 --> 00:58:38.120
- No. no dude.

707
00:58:39.010 --> 00:58:43.139
Like. she is for real. for real.

708
00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:45.473
She doesn't even wanna talk
about talking about it.

709
00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:49.375
And he doesn't
care. he continues to.

710
00:58:49.376 --> 00:58:50.656
You okay?

711
00:58:50.657 --> 00:58:53.601
And he doesn't give me anything.

712
00:58:53.602 --> 00:58:54.684
- No.

713
00:58:54.685 --> 00:58:57.816
And a bunch of
hate and a bunch of abuse.

714
00:58:57.817 --> 00:58:59.639
And I just don't know what to do

715
00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:01.689
because I really. really.

716
00:59:01.690 --> 00:59:02.522
- Stacy.

717
00:59:02.523 --> 00:59:06.292
Stacy. I completely understand
where you're coming from.

718
00:59:06.293 --> 00:59:09.929
This is parasitic people
that we are talking about.

719
00:59:09.930 --> 00:59:12.469
We were talking about
dealing with parasites

720
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:14.493
that just suck the life outta you.

721
00:59:16.050 --> 00:59:18.169
It is parasitic.

722
00:59:18.170 --> 00:59:20.169
He does do that to me.

723
00:59:20.170 --> 00:59:23.191
He's a parasite. you're right.

724
00:59:23.192 --> 00:59:25.146
- So what did you need. Bro?

725
00:59:25.147 --> 00:59:26.147
- So.

726
00:59:27.537 --> 00:59:28.809
I can't believe it.

727
00:59:28.810 --> 00:59:31.799
- Jackie's sister ran away.

728
00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:34.853
but now she's back and she's.

729
00:59:36.110 --> 00:59:36.942
it's hard to really say.

730
00:59:36.943 --> 00:59:38.800
something is just different about her.

731
00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:42.637
- She kinda go a little freak out?

732
00:59:42.638 --> 00:59:44.249
And I give him so much.

733
00:59:44.250 --> 00:59:46.653
- Yeah. you could say that.

734
00:59:49.715 --> 00:59:51.629
Is that why he treats me so bad.

735
00:59:51.630 --> 00:59:53.309
- She gave us a song and dance story

736
00:59:53.310 --> 00:59:55.819
about how she went to the
theater with a bunch of friends.

737
00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:59.209
And I have a hunch that.
that may not be the case.

738
00:59:59.210 --> 01:00:03.009
So I know you have that
job down at the theater.

739
01:00:03.010 --> 01:00:04.926
I was just wanting to know
if there's any possible way

740
01:00:04.927 --> 01:00:07.769
you could get us some of
the security camera footage?

741
01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:09.192
I cook so much for him.

742
01:00:09.193 --> 01:00:10.950
I clean so much for him.

743
01:00:10.951 --> 01:00:12.703
I do everything.

744
01:00:12.704 --> 01:00:14.066
- Man.

745
01:00:14.067 --> 01:00:17.399
you know. I can't be
getting no video footage.

746
01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:18.232
- I know. Bro.

747
01:00:18.233 --> 01:00:20.009
But I mean. it's just.

748
01:00:20.010 --> 01:00:21.269
we don't know what else to do.

749
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:22.270
And it's.

750
01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:24.879
I know it's asking a lot.

751
01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:29.725
Is there any way you can
get any of it at all?

752
01:00:29.726 --> 01:00:31.718
- They could have my ass.

753
01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:41.447
Stacy. Stacy. I completely agree with you.

754
01:00:42.303 --> 01:00:43.434
Absolutely.

755
01:00:43.435 --> 01:00:44.949
You know what I'm gonna do.

756
01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:46.727
I'm gonna transfer you over

757
01:00:46.728 --> 01:00:50.483
to one of our relationship
and commitment therapists.

758
01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:55.010
Dr. Fredericks.

759
01:01:14.810 --> 01:01:18.219
- Ma'am. you're betting a losing hand.

760
01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:21.146
This is classic case throwing
good money after bad.

761
01:01:21.147 --> 01:01:22.039
Okay.

762
01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:24.519
- It's just not worth it. it's trouble.

763
01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:25.620
Get out while you can.

764
01:01:26.548 --> 01:01:27.749
Thank you. Doctor.

765
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:28.750
- Absolutely.

766
01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:34.780
You're crazy.

767
01:01:40.221 --> 01:01:43.071
- You know. I could get in
some serious trouble for this.

768
01:01:44.530 --> 01:01:45.840
Yeah. I know.

769
01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:52.819
- Well. meet me at the theater later.

770
01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:53.870
Thanks. Bro.

771
01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:56.110
- How are you and Jackie?

772
01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.439
- We're doing good. we're doing good.

773
01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.600
We just. we need to get past

774
01:02:01.610 --> 01:02:06.203
this mysterious stage in our relationship.

775
01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:11.229
- Yeah.

776
01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:12.280
Tell that to Britney.

777
01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:16.679
- I'm sorry man.

778
01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:17.929
- Don't be.

779
01:02:17.930 --> 01:02:20.239
It's my own situation.

780
01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:21.240
I'll deal with it.

781
01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:28.240
My way.

782
01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:45.130
- Thanks for the beer.

783
01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:49.540
- Love you. Bro.

784
01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:55.500
Oh.

785
01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:01.099
- Catch you on flip side. brother.

786
01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:02.100
- See you tonight.

787
01:03:09.663 --> 01:03:11.899
- Yes. I would love to hear

788
01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:14.309
about what's going on with your life.

789
01:03:14.310 --> 01:03:18.313
Why don't you tell me all
about all of your problems.

790
01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:51.630
- So you remember when you told
me that Lily went to dinner

791
01:04:51.690 --> 01:04:54.399
and a movie with her friends. right?

792
01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:55.400
- Yeah.

793
01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:57.260
What's wrong?

794
01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:03.069
- Well. I have a friend who does security

795
01:05:03.070 --> 01:05:03.929
at the movie theater

796
01:05:03.930 --> 01:05:08.930
and let's just say there's
some loopholes in her story.

797
01:05:11.470 --> 01:05:12.470
- Like what?

798
01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:34.057
- Where is everybody else?

799
01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:38.253
- There is. is no one else.

800
01:05:41.930 --> 01:05:42.943
All these shots.

801
01:05:45.327 --> 01:05:46.159
- Oh my God.

802
01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:48.382
- She's alone in every one of them.

803
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:52.719
She enters the restaurant alone.

804
01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:54.464
she exits the restaurant alone.

805
01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:13.429
Don't. don't. don't. don't.

806
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:18.139
Let's not disturb Lily
anymore than we have to.

807
01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:19.453
- But I have an idea.

808
01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:22.200
- All right. what?

809
01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:25.763
- We had a camera installed in her room.

810
01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:28.299
- You what?

811
01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:31.619
- We had it installed the second
time she tried to run away.

812
01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:33.569
not in the bathroom or anything weird.

813
01:06:33.570 --> 01:06:35.979
but just to make sure she didn't

814
01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:38.759
have anybody over that she shouldn't over.

815
01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:40.809
or was Skyping somebody that she shouldn't

816
01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:43.122
or doing something that she shouldn't or.

817
01:06:43.123 --> 01:06:44.649
- Right. right. right. I get the picture.

818
01:06:44.650 --> 01:06:46.223
What are you getting at though?

819
01:06:47.330 --> 01:06:51.509
- Well. since we couldn't get
answers from her voluntarily.

820
01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:52.869
maybe we could watch the footage

821
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:56.103
and get answers from her involuntarily.

822
01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:07.939
- But still. I mean. even so.

823
01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:09.559
we'd have to watch the
footage from tonight.

824
01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:10.799
tomorrow though. right?

825
01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:12.743
- No. I can livestream it.

826
01:07:17.490 --> 01:07:20.399
- This is gonna be a long night.

827
01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:22.718
Well. I guess I better
go make some coffee.

828
01:07:22.719 --> 01:07:23.719
- Thank you.

829
01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:14.762
Here you go. babe.

830
01:08:14.763 --> 01:08:15.612
- Thank you.

831
01:08:15.613 --> 01:08:16.613
- Yeah.

832
01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:24.269
Don't get too excited. Jackie.

833
01:08:24.270 --> 01:08:25.920
chances are we won't see a thing.

834
01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:54.430
Yes.

835
01:08:55.670 --> 01:08:56.670
She's sleeping.

836
01:09:04.830 --> 01:09:07.430
I've seen paint dry. that's
more exciting than this.

837
01:09:24.232 --> 01:09:26.732
Oh. she's tossing and turning.

838
01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.875
Jackie. we got action.

839
01:11:53.504 --> 01:11:56.019
Okay.

840
01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:58.352
She must have passed
gas pretty hard there.

841
01:12:51.903 --> 01:12:53.895
- I'm getting kinda worried.

842
01:12:58.370 --> 01:13:01.199
She's been in there 45 minutes.

843
01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:04.366
- Hold on. I think I'll see something.

844
01:14:54.354 --> 01:14:55.354
- Oh my gosh.

845
01:15:03.655 --> 01:15:04.822
What do we do?

846
01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:08.373
- Let's not panic. let's not panic.

847
01:15:09.290 --> 01:15:11.504
What just happened?

848
01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:33.702
- Joel. I wanna get outta here.

849
01:15:33.703 --> 01:15:34.879
- Hold on one second. okay.

850
01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:37.528
We don't know exactly
what's going on here.

851
01:16:15.205 --> 01:16:16.672
- We gotta go. come on.

852
01:16:16.673 --> 01:16:18.367
We have to go.

853
01:16:32.818 --> 01:16:34.568
Start the car.
- Okay.

854
01:16:36.408 --> 01:16:37.298
- Start the car.

855
01:16:37.299 --> 01:16:38.131
Okay.

856
01:16:38.132 --> 01:16:39.202
Come on. we have to go.

857
01:16:39.203 --> 01:16:40.703
- All right. okay.

858
01:16:41.931 --> 01:16:45.042
- I mean. where are we gonna go?

859
01:16:45.043 --> 01:16:47.123
- I don't know. anywhere but here.

860
01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:49.666
- All right. all right.

861
01:16:52.006 --> 01:16:53.109
Oh my God.

862
01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:54.360
- Did you see what I saw?

863
01:16:55.230 --> 01:16:57.897
- Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. I did.

864
01:16:57.898 --> 01:17:00.329
- I am so freaked out right now.

865
01:17:00.330 --> 01:17:02.283
Something is obviously wrong with her.

866
01:17:04.890 --> 01:17:08.689
- Her face contorted in such a way

867
01:17:08.690 --> 01:17:10.320
that it looked like.

868
01:17:11.736 --> 01:17:12.736
- Like what?

869
01:17:16.633 --> 01:17:18.415
- Like she was dead.

870
01:17:18.416 --> 01:17:20.487
Like you said the other day.

871
01:17:33.170 --> 01:17:34.170
Holy.

872
01:17:42.872 --> 01:17:45.219
Who was that?

873
01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:47.359
- Okay. okay. I'm done. I'm done.

874
01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:49.599
No more of this. I've had had enough.

875
01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:51.529
No ghosts. nobody I can see through.

876
01:17:51.530 --> 01:17:52.679
I didn't sign up for this.

877
01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:54.103
- Who was that?

878
01:17:54.104 --> 01:17:56.349
- I couldn't tell.

879
01:17:56.350 --> 01:18:01.350
It all happened so quickly. I.

880
01:18:01.390 --> 01:18:03.703
I don't know. I didn't
get a good look at him.

881
01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:06.199
I didn't recognize him.

882
01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:07.200
Did you?

883
01:18:09.028 --> 01:18:10.679
- I. no. I didn't.

884
01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:13.525
but I think I actually
managed to get a picture.

885
01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:23.949
- Well done. sweetheart.

886
01:18:23.950 --> 01:18:24.950
Good work.

887
01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:32.913
All right. we're gonna need that.

888
01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:36.719
Let's just drive into town

889
01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:39.588
and get something to eat. I guess.

890
01:19:15.706 --> 01:19:18.209
- Lily. where have you been?

891
01:19:18.210 --> 01:19:20.263
People have been looking
everywhere for you?

892
01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:25.433
- I've been away.

893
01:19:26.970 --> 01:19:28.223
But now I am back.

894
01:19:29.970 --> 01:19:33.359
- Lily. your sister and
her boyfriend were here.

895
01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:35.379
They said you were here with Alex.

896
01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:37.329
but you never.

897
01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:42.323
- Are you sure about that?

898
01:20:34.290 --> 01:20:35.290
- Jackie.

899
01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:39.640
We got action.

900
01:20:47.730 --> 01:20:50.109
- So what did you find?

901
01:20:50.110 --> 01:20:52.249
- As usual. more good news.

902
01:20:52.250 --> 01:20:53.639
Check this out.

903
01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:55.999
So I tried to think about how

904
01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.219
I was ever gonna find this guy.

905
01:20:57.220 --> 01:20:59.729
I don't know who he is. I
certainly don't know his name.

906
01:20:59.730 --> 01:21:03.859
But with all of the interesting
things going on with Lily.

907
01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:06.709
as you can imagine. I figured
this guy must be connected.

908
01:21:06.710 --> 01:21:08.989
Bingo. there he is right there.

909
01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:09.989
This guy right here.

910
01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:11.983
this is the guy that we saw last night.

911
01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:17.589
In the flesh or not so much.

912
01:21:17.590 --> 01:21:18.590
Check this out.

913
01:21:23.630 --> 01:21:26.059
This guy was into some
really freaky stuff.

914
01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:28.963
Satan worshiping. calling out the dead.

915
01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:32.149
seances. you name it.

916
01:21:32.150 --> 01:21:35.449
I'm assuming he must have been
one weird kid in high school.

917
01:21:35.450 --> 01:21:36.282
- Yeah.

918
01:21:36.283 --> 01:21:38.709
- He was thrown out a foster
home after foster home

919
01:21:38.710 --> 01:21:41.759
until he was finally released.
which means basically

920
01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:43.959
he was just kicked out on his ass at 18.

921
01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:47.429
Since then. nobody's
heard anything from him.

922
01:21:47.430 --> 01:21:48.711
- That's funny.

923
01:21:48.712 --> 01:21:50.119
When Angela mentioned

924
01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:54.099
there were four missing
teenagers. including Lily.

925
01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:55.369
She mentioned.

926
01:21:55.370 --> 01:21:57.199
- Everybody except him.

927
01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:00.609
Regardless of however much
bull there is to Lily's story.

928
01:22:00.610 --> 01:22:02.469
this much was at least true.

929
01:22:02.470 --> 01:22:06.449
She mentioned five friends.
including this Peter guy.

930
01:22:06.450 --> 01:22:07.723
- Nobody knows who he is?

931
01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:09.799
- Looks that way.

932
01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:11.500
I can't find anything else on him.

933
01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:14.319
- I don't get it though.

934
01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:17.699
what connection does Lily
have with this Peter kid?

935
01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:20.350
- I don't know. but that's
what we're gonna find out.

936
01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:27.070
- Coke. Joel.

937
01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:31.703
- Thanks Chels.

938
01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:34.480
- So. I heard you found Lily.

939
01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:42.509
- Yeah. yeah. she was
out with some friends.

940
01:22:42.510 --> 01:22:43.510
- So I hear.

941
01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:47.793
And I was mistaken. her and I
were here last Friday night.

942
01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:52.570
- Wait. we thought you
something weren't here?

943
01:22:52.571 --> 01:22:53.571
- We did.

944
01:22:57.773 --> 01:22:58.773
- We?

945
01:23:02.533 --> 01:23:03.533
We?

946
01:23:16.050 --> 01:23:17.050
- Hey.

947
01:23:18.570 --> 01:23:19.620
Come on in.

948
01:23:28.710 --> 01:23:29.739
- This is Joel.

949
01:23:29.740 --> 01:23:31.269
Joel. this is my sister. Casey.

950
01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:32.329
- Casey. nice to meet you.

951
01:23:32.330 --> 01:23:34.009
- Nice to meet you.

952
01:23:34.010 --> 01:23:35.439
Lily's not well.

953
01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:36.440
- I know.

954
01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:39.720
- What's wrong with my sister?

955
01:23:41.310 --> 01:23:43.699
- Well. hopefully that's
what we're gonna find out.

956
01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:45.499
I have some special qualifications

957
01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:47.109
and I'd like to have a conversation

958
01:23:47.110 --> 01:23:48.360
with the Lily if I could.

959
01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:50.759
- Okay.

960
01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:51.760
This way.

961
01:23:56.490 --> 01:23:58.803
- You better stay here.

962
01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:03.960
- Okay.

963
01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:09.342
- I guess we were thinking

964
01:24:09.343 --> 01:24:10.712
that maybe if I had a
conversation with her.

965
01:24:10.713 --> 01:24:13.263
I could figure out what's
going on inside her mind.

966
01:24:14.230 --> 01:24:15.530
It's worth a try. I guess.

967
01:24:19.826 --> 01:24:21.372
Her room's right up here.

968
01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:01.280
- Hi Lily.

969
01:25:02.990 --> 01:25:07.019
You remember me. right.
Joel. Jackie's friend?

970
01:25:07.020 --> 01:25:08.993
- You know Jackie. right Lily?

971
01:25:11.630 --> 01:25:12.723
- We'd like to.

972
01:25:14.570 --> 01:25:17.893
I would like to talk to you for
a couple minutes if I could.

973
01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:25.253
Well. first things first.

974
01:25:26.490 --> 01:25:30.637
we'd like to talk to you
about your friend. Peter.

975
01:25:32.352 --> 01:25:34.769
You'd like to talk about him?

976
01:26:20.971 --> 01:26:22.138
We need to go.

977
01:26:25.687 --> 01:26:26.687
- What?

978
01:26:28.324 --> 01:26:30.574
What's happening?

979
01:26:35.633 --> 01:26:39.229
- All right. look. obviously
she's still in shock

980
01:26:39.230 --> 01:26:41.149
from some kind of traumatic experience

981
01:26:41.150 --> 01:26:43.199
that must have happened to her.

982
01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:45.429
When she comes to. we'll
have a little bit better idea

983
01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:46.430
of what's.

984
01:26:47.590 --> 01:26:50.821
- Don't me bullshit me. I need to know.

985
01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:56.892
- We'll be in touch. all right. I promise.

986
01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:06.163
- Babe. what is wrong?

987
01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:12.973
- Whatever's wrong with that
girl is no little thing.

988
01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:17.339
I know psychotics when I see
them. I know the crazies.

989
01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:19.024
I know 'em when I see 'em
and trust me this girl's

990
01:27:19.025 --> 01:27:21.703
got a whole new level of bad wiring.

991
01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:23.860
- Joel. you're scaring me.

992
01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:31.369
- Whatever's wrong with her

993
01:27:31.370 --> 01:27:34.143
is beyond the scope of
my area of expertise.

994
01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:38.729
Maybe even beyond the scope
of medical science in general.

995
01:27:38.730 --> 01:27:39.913
I got a funny feeling.

996
01:27:41.430 --> 01:27:43.470
I think we're gonna need
an outside opinion on this.

997
01:27:49.730 --> 01:27:51.949
Father Dave. Joel. nice to meet you.

998
01:27:51.950 --> 01:27:52.782
- Pleasure to meet you.

999
01:27:52.783 --> 01:27:53.615
- Come on in.

1000
01:27:53.616 --> 01:27:54.616
- Thank you.

1001
01:27:59.350 --> 01:28:02.969
- Well. we really appreciate
you coming to see us

1002
01:28:02.970 --> 01:28:05.259
on such short notice. Father Dave.

1003
01:28:05.260 --> 01:28:08.033
I guess you could say
we're kind of desperate.

1004
01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:09.872
- It's my pleasure.

1005
01:28:09.873 --> 01:28:11.949
It's all part of the
services that I offer.

1006
01:28:11.950 --> 01:28:14.439
What can I do for you two lovely people?

1007
01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:18.289
- Well. we think there's
something very seriously wrong

1008
01:28:18.290 --> 01:28:19.993
with Jackie's sister.

1009
01:28:21.230 --> 01:28:22.833
We think she might be.

1010
01:28:24.458 --> 01:28:27.289
how can I put this. a ghost.

1011
01:28:27.290 --> 01:28:30.379
See. she hasn't been the
same since we found her.

1012
01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:35.380
And you know. she's not
acting like a rape victim

1013
01:28:35.420 --> 01:28:39.429
or any kind of. you know. in
shock or anything like that.

1014
01:28:39.430 --> 01:28:43.019
And she's not giving off any symptoms

1015
01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:46.929
that I can notice from my line of work.

1016
01:28:46.930 --> 01:28:50.683
She's been acting kind of. I don't know.

1017
01:28:52.130 --> 01:28:53.529
- She's acting sadistic.

1018
01:28:53.530 --> 01:28:54.579
- Yeah.

1019
01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:55.580
- Sadistic?

1020
01:28:56.690 --> 01:28:58.169
Well. if she was a spirit.

1021
01:28:58.170 --> 01:29:00.359
then she wouldn't be in her physical body.

1022
01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:02.349
which means that you
wouldn't be able to see her

1023
01:29:02.350 --> 01:29:05.233
or touch her. most certainly
not be able to touch her.

1024
01:29:06.580 --> 01:29:07.899
- Well. he was thinking

1025
01:29:07.900 --> 01:29:09.949
that there might be another possibility.

1026
01:29:09.950 --> 01:29:11.649
- Okay.
- That she might be

1027
01:29:11.650 --> 01:29:13.219
possessed by a demon or something.

1028
01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:14.269
- That's what I was thinking.

1029
01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:16.309
That's the only other
option I can think of.

1030
01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:19.069
She's not really convinced at this point.

1031
01:29:19.070 --> 01:29:22.239
I guess that's why we needed
in an outside opinion.

1032
01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:25.999
- Well. is there a history of demonic play

1033
01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.049
of any spiritual interactions
or anything like that.

1034
01:29:28.050 --> 01:29:29.669
that you know of. or you know of.

1035
01:29:29.670 --> 01:29:31.999
- Not her. but we did find out

1036
01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:35.829
that one of our friends is kind
of into that sort of thing.

1037
01:29:35.830 --> 01:29:37.996
- He's into some crazy stuff.

1038
01:29:40.110 --> 01:29:42.969
So I guess what we're
just kind of wondering.

1039
01:29:42.970 --> 01:29:46.053
is Lily's involvement
with him. with this kid.

1040
01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:49.559
going to affect her in any way.

1041
01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:50.560
- Gotcha.

1042
01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:53.099
Well. from what I
understand about possession

1043
01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:55.389
in my limited experience.

1044
01:29:55.390 --> 01:29:56.649
demonic possession can happen

1045
01:29:56.650 --> 01:29:58.279
when there's a door that's opened up

1046
01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:00.579
for demonic interference.

1047
01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:02.899
And the door has to be open

1048
01:30:02.900 --> 01:30:06.999
for a demonic interaction to occur.

1049
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:10.639
Once that happens and the
interaction does occur.

1050
01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:12.199
the Bible warns us about this.

1051
01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:15.399
Christ warns us about demonic possession.

1052
01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:17.759
People of faith. we believe that the Lord

1053
01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:19.069
protects us from that.

1054
01:30:19.070 --> 01:30:21.199
And that is true. we
are protected by that.

1055
01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:22.309
But the one thing that the God

1056
01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:25.179
does not protect us from is free will.

1057
01:30:25.180 --> 01:30:27.049
And we're warned about this in the Bible.

1058
01:30:27.050 --> 01:30:29.359
We're also warned that if we do

1059
01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:31.229
meddle with these types of spirits

1060
01:30:31.230 --> 01:30:32.809
and these types of activities.

1061
01:30:32.810 --> 01:30:35.109
we're warned that if we do this.

1062
01:30:35.110 --> 01:30:36.819
that we will run into spirits

1063
01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:39.249
that are way beyond our comprehension

1064
01:30:39.250 --> 01:30:40.723
and way beyond our strength.

1065
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:43.470
- Okay.

1066
01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:48.259
Well. one thing that I
think we can be certain of.

1067
01:30:48.260 --> 01:30:52.609
at this point. is what we
did see the other night

1068
01:30:52.610 --> 01:30:54.379
is a ghost.

1069
01:30:54.380 --> 01:30:57.279
I mean. we drove right through this kid.

1070
01:30:57.280 --> 01:31:00.059
I mean. I admit it was
a short interaction.

1071
01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:03.639
but it was long enough for
us to recognize who it was.

1072
01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:07.379
And I'm just gonna throw this out there.

1073
01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:10.359
I think that we are
probably not going to find

1074
01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:11.903
any of Lily's friends.

1075
01:31:13.930 --> 01:31:15.663
alive. at least.

1076
01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:18.579
And that's. I think at this point.

1077
01:31:18.580 --> 01:31:22.839
it's safe to say. as tragic
and as unfortunate as it is.

1078
01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:25.329
that's probably going to be the case.

1079
01:31:25.330 --> 01:31:28.849
So I guess what we're
wondering at this point is

1080
01:31:28.850 --> 01:31:32.559
if Lily is here with us physically.

1081
01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:35.169
why are all her other friends.

1082
01:31:35.170 --> 01:31:37.523
including this other kid. not.

1083
01:31:40.250 --> 01:31:43.429
- I don't know the answer
to that question right now.

1084
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:45.373
I can't answer that at the I'm sorry.

1085
01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:47.260
- Okay.

1086
01:31:49.330 --> 01:31:50.330
That's okay.

1087
01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:52.529
Okay.

1088
01:31:52.530 --> 01:31:54.839
Let's just say for arguments sake.

1089
01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:57.429
that Lily is possessed by some form

1090
01:31:57.430 --> 01:32:02.323
of entity or spirit or
demon let's call it.

1091
01:32:03.330 --> 01:32:07.999
is the obvious answer
for this an exorcism?

1092
01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.103
I mean. is that the route to go?

1093
01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:17.923
- Well. yes. it's an
option. but it's risky.

1094
01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:23.279
Exorcisms are not like
what you see in the movies.

1095
01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:27.679
It's not a big spectacle
with this big fanatic to do

1096
01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:29.679
with this dramatic ending.

1097
01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:31.189
It's not like we take a possessed person.

1098
01:32:31.190 --> 01:32:32.299
we tie 'em to a chair and then

1099
01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:34.259
try to get through
three pages of scripture

1100
01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:36.959
before they break free and
cause havoc on the world.

1101
01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:38.929
That's not it. that's
Hollywood unfortunately.

1102
01:32:38.930 --> 01:32:42.139
As a matter of fact. for
the limited experience

1103
01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:46.269
that I have in exorcisms half
the time they don't work.

1104
01:32:46.270 --> 01:32:49.763
And again. I've never actually
done an exorcism myself.

1105
01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:55.209
- Well. what are the factors involved?

1106
01:32:55.210 --> 01:32:59.159
- There's only one factor and
that's Jesus Christ himself.

1107
01:32:59.160 --> 01:33:01.359
Christ almighty is the only person

1108
01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:04.999
that can cast out a
demon. we can't do that.

1109
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:09.069
Only Jesus has the power to
exercise a demon. not us.

1110
01:33:09.070 --> 01:33:11.079
It's up to his divine will when and where

1111
01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:12.809
an exorcism actually occurs.

1112
01:33:12.810 --> 01:33:15.349
It's up to his divine will.
if a demon is cast out

1113
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:17.329
or if a demon is not cast out.

1114
01:33:17.330 --> 01:33:19.329
Christ decides when and where

1115
01:33:19.330 --> 01:33:21.409
an exorcism take takes place. not us.

1116
01:33:21.410 --> 01:33:23.029
It's his divine will that decides

1117
01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:25.059
when an exorcism takes place

1118
01:33:25.060 --> 01:33:28.629
and who it takes place on
and how it takes place.

1119
01:33:28.630 --> 01:33:30.449
It's not up to us.

1120
01:33:30.450 --> 01:33:31.749
If an exorcism takes place.

1121
01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:34.669
it's because Christ willed it. not us.

1122
01:33:34.670 --> 01:33:36.033
It's his divine will.

1123
01:33:38.997 --> 01:33:39.859
- Okay.

1124
01:33:39.860 --> 01:33:42.639
- So you're saying that if
we were to do an exorcism.

1125
01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:43.923
it might not even work.

1126
01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:47.439
- Yes.

1127
01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:49.890
But I can tell you with all certainty

1128
01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:53.649
that he would want you to
do everything in your power

1129
01:33:53.650 --> 01:33:55.399
to try to save your sister.

1130
01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:56.550
That's the right thing.

1131
01:33:58.370 --> 01:33:59.370
- And we will.

1132
01:34:03.460 --> 01:34:07.283
Father Dave. are you the one to help us?

1133
01:34:12.330 --> 01:34:15.809
- Again. I've never
done an exorcism before.

1134
01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:21.423
But I'm willing to try.

1135
01:34:29.090 --> 01:34:29.922
- Father Dave.

1136
01:34:29.923 --> 01:34:32.509
- Yes.
- If we were

1137
01:34:32.510 --> 01:34:36.189
to do the exorcism. is there
any way that it could harm us?

1138
01:34:36.190 --> 01:34:37.309
- No.

1139
01:34:37.310 --> 01:34:38.609
No. absolutely not.

1140
01:34:38.610 --> 01:34:40.559
Those of us that have our faith in Christ

1141
01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:41.669
are free and clear

1142
01:34:41.670 --> 01:34:45.239
from any kind of demonic
interaction outside.

1143
01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:47.359
We are not threatened by outside forces.

1144
01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:49.273
demonic forces. anything like that.

1145
01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:52.979
We're impervious to those
types of interferences.

1146
01:34:52.980 --> 01:34:55.779
And we are both believers. correct?

1147
01:34:55.780 --> 01:34:57.112
- Absolutely.

1148
01:34:57.113 --> 01:34:58.665
Yes. yes.

1149
01:34:58.666 --> 01:35:00.103
- Yes. yes we are.

1150
01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:19.120
- Great.

1151
01:35:22.859 --> 01:35:23.942
That's great.

1152
01:35:49.150 --> 01:35:51.978
- I can't believe this is happening to us.

1153
01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:55.040
- I know.

1154
01:35:56.580 --> 01:35:58.699
Well. when all this is over.

1155
01:35:58.700 --> 01:35:59.879
just make sure that your sister

1156
01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:03.453
doesn't have any more
involvement with that kid.

1157
01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:09.990
- I'm just so scared.

1158
01:36:14.892 --> 01:36:15.724
- It's okay.

1159
01:36:15.725 --> 01:36:17.887
Everything's gonna be okay.

1160
01:36:17.888 --> 01:36:19.533
I can feel it. right here.

1161
01:36:20.620 --> 01:36:22.220
Everything's gonna be all right.

1162
01:36:23.950 --> 01:36:24.950
You'll see.

1163
01:36:26.630 --> 01:36:29.759
- I've heard horror
stories about possessions.

1164
01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:32.619
- Yeah. but just remember
what father Dave said.

1165
01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:34.589
It's not like what you see in the movies.

1166
01:36:34.590 --> 01:36:36.990
And he is a credible
source. he knows his stuff.

1167
01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:41.999
Just have a little faith.

1168
01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.796
And don't worry. I'll be here
for you every up the way.

1169
01:36:44.797 --> 01:36:46.590
you know that.

1170
01:36:58.051 --> 01:36:59.051
- Joel.

1171
01:37:00.215 --> 01:37:01.215
- Yeah?

1172
01:37:09.540 --> 01:37:11.890
- How come you've never
been to church with me?

1173
01:37:14.270 --> 01:37:16.299
We've been together for over a year

1174
01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:19.897
and my church friends
still haven't met you.

1175
01:37:22.372 --> 01:37:25.367
- I guess it just hasn't been
the right time. you know.

1176
01:37:27.490 --> 01:37:32.490
But who knows. maybe now is the time.

1177
01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:02.730
- I thought we agreed we were gonna wait.

1178
01:38:19.321 --> 01:38:22.389
I think I'm going to go
over to Mom's tonight.

1179
01:38:22.390 --> 01:38:24.373
I don't think that she should be alone.

1180
01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:28.239
- Well. I mean. that's fine. I understand.

1181
01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:29.979
But I don't think we should

1182
01:38:29.980 --> 01:38:31.680
be alone tonight either. you know.

1183
01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:34.490
- I'll be fine.

1184
01:40:02.977 --> 01:40:03.977
- Oh.

1185
01:40:05.530 --> 01:40:07.119
Where have you been?

1186
01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:08.899
Everybody's been looking
everywhere for you.

1187
01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:09.913
- I'm fine.

1188
01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:14.904
- Well. where have you been?

1189
01:40:18.250 --> 01:40:19.250
- Places.

1190
01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:23.999
- Fine.

1191
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:25.069
I get it.

1192
01:40:25.070 --> 01:40:26.649
You don't have to tell me.

1193
01:40:26.650 --> 01:40:27.779
it's none of my business.

1194
01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:30.230
what you and that girl
have been up to. whatever.

1195
01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:39.749
I was gonna make a frozen
pizza for us for dinner.

1196
01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:40.750
Will we grab it?

1197
01:41:16.569 --> 01:41:17.569
- Thanks.

1198
01:41:27.988 --> 01:41:28.988
- You know.

1199
01:41:31.744 --> 01:41:32.994
- Come on Cody.

1200
01:41:34.172 --> 01:41:35.172
It's fine.

1201
01:41:37.190 --> 01:41:38.611
I mean. it's okay.

1202
01:41:38.612 --> 01:41:42.025
Like I love you and we
can get through anything.

1203
01:41:42.026 --> 01:41:43.379
It's okay.

1204
01:41:43.380 --> 01:41:47.952
Cody. can you just stop?

1205
01:41:47.953 --> 01:41:51.036
Come on. I'm your sister. I love you.

1206
01:41:52.271 --> 01:41:54.688
Okay. can you just like stop?

1207
01:41:56.520 --> 01:41:57.520
I love you.

1208
01:41:58.420 --> 01:42:00.629
Can you just like stop moving?

1209
01:42:00.630 --> 01:42:02.259
I'm serious.

1210
01:42:02.260 --> 01:42:03.119
I'm serious.

1211
01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:04.417
I don't want any.

1212
01:42:07.437 --> 01:42:08.959
I'm not kidding.

1213
01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:11.433
Wait. can you stop moving.

1214
01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:15.070
You're really starting to freak me out.

1215
01:42:17.150 --> 01:42:19.627
You're not gonna hurt me. are you?

1216
01:42:21.325 --> 01:42:22.325
- No.

1217
01:42:24.078 --> 01:42:25.538
Okay.

1218
01:43:18.410 --> 01:43:19.410
- Hello?

1219
01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:21.960
Hello?

1220
01:43:51.910 --> 01:43:53.133
God.

1221
01:43:53.134 --> 01:43:56.383
Liz. how'd you get in here?

1222
01:44:01.470 --> 01:44:03.009
Where have you been?

1223
01:44:03.010 --> 01:44:04.573
We've all been looking for you.

1224
01:44:05.550 --> 01:44:07.003
Have you seen my sister?

1225
01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:13.253
- Yes. I have.

1226
01:44:14.890 --> 01:44:16.543
We're very happy together.

1227
01:44:19.060 --> 01:44:20.387
I've come back for you.

1228
01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:23.323
What are you talking about?

1229
01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:26.909
Liz. you're freaking me out.

1230
01:44:26.910 --> 01:44:27.742
- I've come.

1231
01:44:27.743 --> 01:44:29.283
- What are you talking about?

1232
01:44:30.270 --> 01:44:32.743
I've come back so you can join us.

1233
01:44:36.270 --> 01:44:37.499
- Okay. you're freaking out.

1234
01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:40.429
Just. are you gonna just
stand there and be all freaky.

1235
01:44:40.430 --> 01:44:41.809
like an idiot. or are
you gonna come over here

1236
01:44:41.810 --> 01:44:43.553
and tell me what's going on?

1237
01:44:46.727 --> 01:44:49.477
Liz. Liz. what's happened to you?

1238
01:44:51.099 --> 01:44:53.099
Liz. what are you doing?

1239
01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:25.440
- Ava.

1240
01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:36.240
Ava.

1241
01:45:43.226 --> 01:45:44.661
Shh.

1242
01:45:44.662 --> 01:45:45.939
My God. what are you doing here?

1243
01:45:45.940 --> 01:45:47.194
Ava texted me too.

1244
01:46:10.237 --> 01:46:11.237
Ava.

1245
01:46:13.630 --> 01:46:14.630
Ava.

1246
01:46:29.107 --> 01:46:30.331
- Ava.

1247
01:46:59.639 --> 01:47:00.639
- You.

1248
01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:04.849
- Ava. you're okay.

1249
01:47:04.850 --> 01:47:07.309
- You did this.

1250
01:47:07.310 --> 01:47:08.310
- No.

1251
01:47:09.190 --> 01:47:11.483
- You lied to me.

1252
01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:14.226
Making it all about my brother.

1253
01:47:14.227 --> 01:47:15.883
and your sister.

1254
01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:21.229
This is all your fault.

1255
01:47:21.230 --> 01:47:22.556
- Ava. what are you talking about?

1256
01:47:22.557 --> 01:47:24.933
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1257
01:47:25.810 --> 01:47:27.823
- Ava. that's far enough.

1258
01:47:29.770 --> 01:47:30.972
Drop the knife.

1259
01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:34.559
- She has to die.

1260
01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:35.889
- Nobody's dead yet.

1261
01:47:35.890 --> 01:47:37.259
Let's keep it that way.

1262
01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:38.260
Drop the knife.

1263
01:47:42.890 --> 01:47:44.963
- You think no. one's dead yet?

1264
01:47:47.660 --> 01:47:51.981
- You have no idea what's going on.

1265
01:47:53.570 --> 01:47:57.590
If I were you. I'd run far. far away.

1266
01:48:00.352 --> 01:48:01.483
- Yeah. from who?

1267
01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:07.400
- Her.

1268
01:48:12.150 --> 01:48:13.150
- Hold it.

1269
01:48:17.650 --> 01:48:18.849
Call Pastor Dave.

1270
01:48:18.850 --> 01:48:19.850
- I'm on it.

1271
01:48:25.591 --> 01:48:26.946
Take it easy now.

1272
01:48:47.180 --> 01:48:48.180
- Hello.

1273
01:48:49.010 --> 01:48:51.759
- Jackie. do not come home.

1274
01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:53.233
Stay as far away as possible.

1275
01:48:54.139 --> 01:48:56.039
I'll let you know if anything changes.

1276
01:48:58.855 --> 01:49:00.446
- Hello.

1277
01:49:08.670 --> 01:49:10.573
Hello. are you there?

1278
01:49:13.250 --> 01:49:14.250
Step on it.

1279
01:49:19.842 --> 01:49:22.179
- Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

1280
01:49:22.180 --> 01:49:23.529
We don't know exactly
what's going on here.

1281
01:49:23.530 --> 01:49:24.362
Maybe we should just wait

1282
01:49:24.363 --> 01:49:25.969
for Father Dave to show up. I mean.

1283
01:49:25.970 --> 01:49:27.423
- I wanna see if Mom is okay.

1284
01:49:28.322 --> 01:49:29.405
- Okay. okay.

1285
01:49:35.420 --> 01:49:36.420
- Mom.

1286
01:49:42.740 --> 01:49:43.740
- Hey. hey.

1287
01:49:46.730 --> 01:49:49.779
Okay. Pastor Dave says he'll
be here in about 15 minutes.

1288
01:49:49.780 --> 01:49:52.169
Maybe we should wait for him to get here.

1289
01:49:52.170 --> 01:49:54.819
- I told you I have to
make sure that Mom's okay.

1290
01:49:54.820 --> 01:49:58.237
- That's right. okay. go ahead. go ahead.

1291
01:50:00.108 --> 01:50:01.259
Mom.

1292
01:50:01.260 --> 01:50:02.260
- Mrs. Deckert.

1293
01:50:04.013 --> 01:50:05.303
it's Joel Townsend.

1294
01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:11.680
Hello. Mrs. Deckert.

1295
01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:49.393
- Mom. Mom are you down here?

1296
01:51:00.010 --> 01:51:02.643
Joel. I can't find Mom.

1297
01:51:07.810 --> 01:51:09.803
- Hey. all right. guys.

1298
01:51:11.860 --> 01:51:13.519
Let's get this over with.

1299
01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:15.242
Where's the girl?

1300
01:51:15.243 --> 01:51:16.609
- We don't know.

1301
01:51:16.610 --> 01:51:19.283
We can't find her. but we
did find something else.

1302
01:51:30.562 --> 01:51:31.562
Look.

1303
01:51:33.203 --> 01:51:34.203
- Oh my.

1304
01:51:36.852 --> 01:51:38.496
Unbelievable.

1305
01:51:52.268 --> 01:51:53.351
Unbelievable.

1306
01:51:55.870 --> 01:51:56.992
- Can you read this?

1307
01:51:56.993 --> 01:51:57.993
- Yes I can.

1308
01:51:58.950 --> 01:51:59.950
Yes I can.

1309
01:52:02.890 --> 01:52:03.909
- Great.

1310
01:52:03.910 --> 01:52:04.910
What does it say?

1311
01:52:14.893 --> 01:52:16.351
Joel.

1312
01:52:16.352 --> 01:52:17.352
Joel.

1313
01:52:22.304 --> 01:52:23.637
Jackie.

1314
01:52:28.293 --> 01:52:30.329
What have you done?

1315
01:52:30.330 --> 01:52:35.330
- Listen to me. this house
is under demonic possession.

1316
01:52:38.212 --> 01:52:43.212
- What. what. why. what.
you can fix this. right?

1317
01:52:45.730 --> 01:52:46.730
- I don't know.

1318
01:52:48.067 --> 01:52:49.150
I don't know.

1319
01:52:52.075 --> 01:52:53.789
- There has to be something we can do.

1320
01:52:53.790 --> 01:52:55.689
Like maybe if we found the door that.

1321
01:52:55.690 --> 01:52:57.749
that Peter Guy opened and close it.

1322
01:52:57.750 --> 01:52:58.582
There's there has to be something.

1323
01:52:58.583 --> 01:53:01.889
- This isn't about Peter and
this isn't about your sister.

1324
01:53:01.890 --> 01:53:03.033
This is about you.

1325
01:53:05.410 --> 01:53:06.999
- Me. what?

1326
01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.503
- Peter and your sister
were just a distraction.

1327
01:53:10.750 --> 01:53:12.839
a means to the end.

1328
01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:13.933
This is about you.

1329
01:53:15.813 --> 01:53:16.699
I don't understand.

1330
01:53:16.700 --> 01:53:21.700
- Jackie. Jackie. you are a
woman after God's own heart.

1331
01:53:22.750 --> 01:53:27.593
pure in heart. pure in mind and in soul.

1332
01:53:28.900 --> 01:53:30.569
Jackie. I don't know why God

1333
01:53:30.570 --> 01:53:32.379
is making you go through this torment.

1334
01:53:32.380 --> 01:53:34.103
this trial. but he is.

1335
01:53:35.290 --> 01:53:38.249
I will be with you every
step of the way. Jackie.

1336
01:53:38.250 --> 01:53:40.463
but you can't do this alone.

1337
01:53:41.890 --> 01:53:42.890
Do you hear me?

1338
01:53:44.630 --> 01:53:46.953
You can't do by yourself. Jackie.

1339
01:53:49.312 --> 01:53:51.539
- Why have you done this to Joel?

1340
01:53:51.540 --> 01:53:53.290
- Because you're not safe with him.

1341
01:53:55.151 --> 01:53:58.125
Why do you say that?

1342
01:53:58.126 --> 01:54:00.043
- I think you know why.

1343
01:55:06.275 --> 01:55:07.606
- Lily.

1344
01:57:02.370 --> 01:57:05.469
- All right. guys. I'm excited
to finally tell you all

1345
01:57:05.470 --> 01:57:07.679
why I brought you here tonight.

1346
01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:10.839
- Candles and dark
colored water. a seance?

1347
01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:11.779
- Yeah. this is great.

1348
01:57:11.780 --> 01:57:13.439
This is exactly what I wanted. okay.

1349
01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:16.439
To bring back demons so
that they can kill us.

1350
01:57:16.440 --> 01:57:17.440
This is great.

1351
01:57:18.540 --> 01:57:21.619
- Dude. you're afraid of
everything. just chill.

1352
01:57:21.620 --> 01:57:22.879
This is stupid. this is dumb.

1353
01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:24.129
Stop bringing me to these things.

1354
01:57:24.130 --> 01:57:25.449
I don't want to be here. stop.

1355
01:57:25.450 --> 01:57:26.299
- Oh for crying out loud.

1356
01:57:26.300 --> 01:57:27.719
you're gonna wear a
hole through the floor.

1357
01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:30.169
- Ooh. is that how he's
gonna die. like fall through

1358
01:57:30.170 --> 01:57:31.939
and then we bring him back to life?

1359
01:57:31.940 --> 01:57:33.600
- That's not how this works.

1360
01:57:33.601 --> 01:57:35.456
- Oh. then he's over.

1361
01:57:35.457 --> 01:57:37.049
- You don't kill the people you're with.

1362
01:57:37.050 --> 01:57:39.959
you find somebody who's already been dead.

1363
01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:40.792
You bring back somebody

1364
01:57:40.793 --> 01:57:42.659
who's already dead. dingbat.

1365
01:57:42.660 --> 01:57:45.183
Ooh. so like Michael Jackson.

1366
01:57:45.184 --> 01:57:46.140
Oh my God.

1367
01:57:46.141 --> 01:57:46.973
Hee. hee.

1368
01:57:46.974 --> 01:57:47.989
Ooh. Paul Walker.

1369
01:57:47.990 --> 01:57:48.892
He was really pretty.

1370
01:57:48.893 --> 01:57:51.193
Hey. at least
it smells nice in here.

1371
01:57:52.430 --> 01:57:54.213
- If you like to smell dead fruit?

1372
01:57:55.290 --> 01:57:56.915
This is gonna be the adventure

1373
01:57:56.916 --> 01:57:59.284
I've been waiting for.

1374
01:57:59.285 --> 01:58:01.745
- Oh yeah. until they call back Satan.

1375
01:58:01.746 --> 01:58:03.582
Oh. we're not
gonna call back Satan.

1376
01:58:03.583 --> 01:58:06.559
We're call back somebody better than that.

1377
01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:09.909
- It's a seance. we may as
well call back somebody good.

1378
01:58:09.910 --> 01:58:10.899
- Yeah.
- Oh my gosh.

1379
01:58:10.900 --> 01:58:12.509
- Ooh. we can bring back somebody cool.

1380
01:58:12.510 --> 01:58:13.703
Like Rosa Parks or.

1381
01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:16.520
Whitney Houston.

1382
01:58:18.263 --> 01:58:20.629
What are we
gonna do. have a concert?

1383
01:58:20.630 --> 01:58:23.039
Yeah. she'll serenade us.

1384
01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:23.872
Hee. hee.

1385
01:58:23.873 --> 01:58:26.237
Ooh. Paul
Walker. he was really pretty.

1386
01:58:27.574 --> 01:58:31.289
- Isn't he a little messed up?

1387
01:58:31.290 --> 01:58:32.122
Well. he's dead.

1388
01:58:32.123 --> 01:58:32.955
So yeah. probably.

1389
01:58:32.956 --> 01:58:34.179
Doesn't matter
who you bring back.

1390
01:58:34.180 --> 01:58:35.012
when you bring 'em back.

1391
01:58:35.013 --> 01:58:36.599
then they're gonna turn into a demon freak

1392
01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:37.969
and they're still gonna kill you.

1393
01:58:37.970 --> 01:58:40.506
- They're not a demon. they're a ghost.

1394
01:58:40.507 --> 01:58:42.873
"Thriller" was just a music video.

1395
01:58:44.250 --> 01:58:46.339
- So the big surprise is.

1396
01:58:46.340 --> 01:58:51.340
I have the capability to bring
a very close friend of mine

1397
01:58:52.610 --> 01:58:56.889
back from the realms of the
other side. so to speak.

1398
01:58:56.890 --> 01:58:59.793
Let's just call him. Napoleon.

1399
01:59:02.184 --> 01:59:03.679
Like Bonaparte?

1400
01:59:03.680 --> 01:59:05.540
- No. Dynamite. like the movie.

1401
01:59:05.541 --> 01:59:07.447
Napoleon Dynamite?

1402
01:59:07.448 --> 01:59:09.651
- I could go with that.

1403
01:59:09.652 --> 01:59:11.399
- At least you can bring back
some Tater tots. you know.

1404
01:59:11.400 --> 01:59:12.629
I'm getting hungry now.

1405
01:59:12.630 --> 01:59:14.253
- Do you know you fat ward?

1406
01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:16.269
- I'm not a lama.

1407
01:59:16.270 --> 01:59:17.102
- This is great.

1408
01:59:17.103 --> 01:59:19.469
This is exactly what I
wanted to be dragged here

1409
01:59:19.470 --> 01:59:22.579
and forced to do this evil. demonic thing.

1410
01:59:22.580 --> 01:59:24.962
where we can bring back
demons so that we can die.

1411
01:59:24.963 --> 01:59:25.795
This is great.

1412
01:59:25.796 --> 01:59:26.628
A little tea party.

1413
01:59:26.629 --> 01:59:28.979
with all petit fours and
those dainty little cups.

1414
01:59:28.980 --> 01:59:30.679
- Can we just get on with it. okay?

1415
01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:31.789
It doesn't sound like you guys

1416
01:59:31.790 --> 01:59:33.239
are taking this seriously. okay.

1417
01:59:33.240 --> 01:59:35.929
We could actually be hurt or worse.

1418
01:59:35.930 --> 01:59:38.849
Cody. no one's
gonna die. it's fine.

1419
01:59:38.850 --> 01:59:39.850
- Probably.

1420
01:59:41.210 --> 01:59:44.259
- Dude. I've done this
a million times before.

1421
01:59:44.260 --> 01:59:45.479
I know what I'm doing.

1422
01:59:45.480 --> 01:59:47.175
Just chill out.

1423
01:59:48.800 --> 01:59:50.500
- You realize this is not a party.

1424
01:59:51.810 --> 01:59:53.999
Just bring some petit fours. and hot tea.

1425
01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:55.269
- Yes. this isn't a game.

1426
01:59:55.270 --> 01:59:58.539
This is like. does anybody not understand

1427
01:59:58.540 --> 02:00:00.222
the full concept of what this is?

1428
02:00:00.223 --> 02:00:01.669
This is dangerous stuff.

1429
02:00:01.670 --> 02:00:03.732
I don't understand what you
keep bringing me into this.

1430
02:00:03.733 --> 02:00:05.813
It's okay. Cody bear.

1431
02:00:06.903 --> 02:00:10.119
- For crying out loud.
would you just stand still

1432
02:00:10.120 --> 02:00:11.829
for like 30 seconds.

1433
02:00:11.830 --> 02:00:13.769
or even half a second. I
don't even care at this point.

1434
02:00:13.770 --> 02:00:14.602
- I'm thinking.

1435
02:00:14.603 --> 02:00:16.749
- Really?

1436
02:00:16.750 --> 02:00:18.559
Does your brain work that well?

1437
02:00:18.560 --> 02:00:19.560
- No.

1438
02:00:21.010 --> 02:00:22.110
- So when do we start?

1439
02:00:23.812 --> 02:00:24.812
- Right now.

1440
02:00:26.300 --> 02:00:27.459
Who's with me?

1441
02:00:27.460 --> 02:00:28.840
I'm in.

1442
02:00:28.841 --> 02:00:31.482
- I think you already
know the answer to that.

1443
02:00:40.270 --> 02:00:41.270
- I'm down.

1444
02:00:42.939 --> 02:00:44.868
I'm in.

1445
02:00:44.869 --> 02:00:47.952
- I don't have anything better to do.

1446
02:00:48.930 --> 02:00:49.930
- I'm game.

1447
02:00:50.596 --> 02:00:52.363
- Sure. let's all just die together.

1448
02:00:53.220 --> 02:00:55.027
Group suicide. woo.

1449
02:00:56.371 --> 02:00:58.684
Sure. let's die together.

1450
02:01:00.698 --> 02:01:01.698
- So exciting.

1451
02:01:04.692 --> 02:01:05.692
What?

1452
02:02:09.616 --> 02:02:10.616
- Jackie.

1453
02:02:12.334 --> 02:02:13.670
Jackie.

1454
02:02:49.316 --> 02:02:50.316
- Joel.

1455
02:02:52.243 --> 02:02:53.243
Joel.

1456
02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:25.800
Joel.

1457
02:04:28.152 --> 02:04:29.152
Joel.

1458
02:04:54.911 --> 02:04:55.911
Mom. Mom.

1459
02:04:57.055 --> 02:04:58.789
Oh my God. Mom. are you okay?

1460
02:04:58.790 --> 02:04:59.979
Oh my God.

1461
02:04:59.980 --> 02:05:02.039
Oh my God. Mom. wake up.

1462
02:05:02.040 --> 02:05:03.209
Oh my God.

1463
02:05:03.210 --> 02:05:04.969
Oh my God. Mom. wake up.

1464
02:05:04.970 --> 02:05:05.970
Oh my God.

1465
02:05:06.850 --> 02:05:07.850
No. Mom.

1466
02:05:09.599 --> 02:05:10.599
Oh my God.

1467
02:05:11.499 --> 02:05:12.499
No. Mom.

1468
02:05:55.125 --> 02:05:56.517
- I got her boxed in.

1469
02:05:56.518 --> 02:05:57.768
Now. Dave. now.

1470
02:06:01.751 --> 02:06:03.659
- In the name of the Father and of the Son

1471
02:06:03.660 --> 02:06:05.249
and the Holy Spirit.

1472
02:06:05.250 --> 02:06:07.820
Father. I asked for your
mercy and your blessing.

1473
02:06:10.410 --> 02:06:12.529
I asked for your mercy. Father. Lord.

1474
02:06:12.530 --> 02:06:13.680
I asked for your mercy.

1475
02:06:15.459 --> 02:06:16.291
No.

1476
02:06:16.292 --> 02:06:17.292
Protect this house.

1477
02:06:18.170 --> 02:06:19.002
If it's your will.

1478
02:06:19.003 --> 02:06:20.283
if it's your will Father.

1479
02:06:21.240 --> 02:06:24.053
let this house and this girl be free

1480
02:06:24.054 --> 02:06:25.413
from this demonic force. Father.

1481
02:06:25.414 --> 02:06:26.653
In the name of the Father and of the Son

1482
02:06:26.654 --> 02:06:27.486
and of the Holy Spirit.

1483
02:06:27.487 --> 02:06:28.930
that you free this woman in this house

1484
02:06:28.931 --> 02:06:30.462
from this demonic force. Father.

1485
02:06:30.463 --> 02:06:31.614
That you free this woman in this house

1486
02:06:31.615 --> 02:06:32.987
from this demonic force. Father.

1487
02:06:32.988 --> 02:06:34.336
In the name of the Father and of the Son

1488
02:06:34.337 --> 02:06:36.108
and of the Holy Spirit.

1489
02:06:37.940 --> 02:06:40.880
We ask that you take this demon
and condemn it back to hell.

1490
02:06:40.881 --> 02:06:42.712
That you free this woman in this house

1491
02:06:42.713 --> 02:06:45.380
from this demonic force. Father.

1492
02:06:48.390 --> 02:06:50.949
Protect this house and this woman.

1493
02:06:50.950 --> 02:06:52.573
from this demonic force. Father.

1494
02:06:55.550 --> 02:06:57.787
Amen. amen. amen.

1495
02:06:57.788 --> 02:06:59.411
Amen. amen. amen.

1496
02:07:36.092 --> 02:07:37.175
- Lily. Lily.

1497
02:07:38.899 --> 02:07:40.066
Lily. wake up.

1498
02:07:42.899 --> 02:07:44.066
Wake up. Lily.

1499
02:07:46.149 --> 02:07:48.522
Oh my gosh. are you okay?

1500
02:07:48.523 --> 02:07:49.531
Oh my gosh.

1501
02:07:52.846 --> 02:07:53.855
- Jackie.

1502
02:07:53.856 --> 02:07:55.435
- Oh my gosh. Lily.

1503
02:07:55.436 --> 02:07:56.288
Jackie.

1504
02:07:56.289 --> 02:07:57.372
- Oh my gosh.

1505
02:07:58.868 --> 02:08:00.368
Everything's fine.

1506
02:08:02.561 --> 02:08:03.676
Oh my gosh.

1507
02:08:06.437 --> 02:08:08.399
What happened?

1508
02:08:08.400 --> 02:08:10.597
- Everything's fine. it's okay.

1509
02:08:10.598 --> 02:08:11.598
Okay.

1510
02:08:14.825 --> 02:08:17.242
I'm sorry. everything's fine.

1511
02:08:28.560 --> 02:08:29.560
- Amen.

1512
02:08:30.587 --> 02:08:31.587
Amen.

1513
02:08:32.690 --> 02:08:33.690
Amen.

1514
02:08:42.430 --> 02:08:44.669
- So. you don't think Lily

1515
02:08:44.670 --> 02:08:46.420
will get the death penalty. do you?

1516
02:08:48.280 --> 02:08:50.499
- I don't know.

1517
02:08:50.500 --> 02:08:51.989
I certainly don't think the jury

1518
02:08:51.990 --> 02:08:54.847
is gonna believe. "The
devil made me do it."

1519
02:08:59.230 --> 02:09:01.969
Even with Father Dave's testimony.

1520
02:09:01.970 --> 02:09:03.399
I really don't think it's gonna be enough

1521
02:09:03.400 --> 02:09:07.669
to convince the jury that she
didn't kill those four kids.

1522
02:09:07.670 --> 02:09:09.469
I mean. maybe we can
just make them believe

1523
02:09:09.470 --> 02:09:11.689
that she didn't do it intentionally.

1524
02:09:11.690 --> 02:09:13.940
There's no other way to
explain their deaths.

1525
02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:18.399
I just think the best thing
that we just go for is.

1526
02:09:18.400 --> 02:09:21.403
just go for the insanity
plea and hope that it sticks.

1527
02:09:23.470 --> 02:09:25.420
- How likely do you think that'll work?

1528
02:09:27.690 --> 02:09:28.889
- Miss. Deckert.

1529
02:09:28.890 --> 02:09:29.949
Yes.

1530
02:09:29.950 --> 02:09:30.789
- Detective Reinhardt.

1531
02:09:30.790 --> 02:09:32.649
I'd like to ask you a couple of questions.

1532
02:09:32.650 --> 02:09:33.819
if you don't mind.

1533
02:09:33.820 --> 02:09:34.741
- Yeah.
- Right this way.

1534
02:09:34.742 --> 02:09:36.733
- Of course. of course.
- Right this way.

1535
02:09:40.605 --> 02:09:42.887
We'll be a few more minutes. Sir.

1536
02:09:44.234 --> 02:09:45.428
Relax.

1537
02:09:45.429 --> 02:09:46.349
- It's okay.

1538
02:09:46.350 --> 02:09:47.350
- Thank you.

1539
02:10:02.030 --> 02:10:03.173
Please take a seat.

1540
02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:13.143
Officer Austin. can I
get the folder please?

1541
02:10:20.660 --> 02:10:22.719
- There you are. Sir.

1542
02:10:22.720 --> 02:10:23.720
- Thank you.

1543
02:10:46.050 --> 02:10:47.050
Excuse me.

1544
02:10:53.300 --> 02:10:56.099
Miss. Deckert. I would
like to hear your version

1545
02:10:56.100 --> 02:11:00.193
of what happened. what this
Mr. David Miller said to you?

1546
02:11:03.550 --> 02:11:08.550
- Well. Father Dave is
a priest at my church

1547
02:11:08.570 --> 02:11:13.570
and he said that there are
demonic forces that are after me.

1548
02:11:13.770 --> 02:11:17.509
and my sister was possessed by a demon.

1549
02:11:17.510 --> 02:11:20.339
And that thankfully
Father Dave was able to

1550
02:11:20.340 --> 02:11:22.453
drive away and.

1551
02:11:24.820 --> 02:11:26.470
What's gonna happen to my sister?

1552
02:11:27.640 --> 02:11:29.853
- That's the problem.
Ma'am. we don't know.

1553
02:11:31.400 --> 02:11:33.009
According to the statements given

1554
02:11:33.010 --> 02:11:34.893
by Mr. Miller and your fiance.

1555
02:11:35.820 --> 02:11:36.859
You said that your mother

1556
02:11:36.860 --> 02:11:38.259
was found dead in your living room?

1557
02:11:38.260 --> 02:11:39.953
- Yeah.
- Correct?

1558
02:11:41.610 --> 02:11:42.710
We never found a body.

1559
02:11:44.090 --> 02:11:48.053
See. me and my men. we went in
there. the place was cleaned.

1560
02:11:51.180 --> 02:11:53.629
- Now it also states in the report

1561
02:11:53.630 --> 02:11:57.033
that there were crayon writings
all over the walls and.

1562
02:11:57.034 --> 02:11:59.160
- Yeah.
- We never found any of them.

1563
02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:03.319
- I mean. they were there.

1564
02:12:03.320 --> 02:12:05.039
where you at the right house?

1565
02:12:05.040 --> 02:12:06.469
They were there.

1566
02:12:06.470 --> 02:12:07.570
- Yes. Ma'am. we were.

1567
02:12:08.740 --> 02:12:11.559
Now as far as the other kids.

1568
02:12:11.560 --> 02:12:14.899
it's referring to Peter
Stevenson. Cody James.

1569
02:12:14.900 --> 02:12:17.409
Alexandra Carrell and Elizabeth Duncan.

1570
02:12:17.410 --> 02:12:19.089
correct?
- Yes.

1571
02:12:19.090 --> 02:12:19.999
My sister killed them.

1572
02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:23.713
but she was under the
influence of demonic forces.

1573
02:12:24.840 --> 02:12:26.149
I know you can't take my word for it.

1574
02:12:26.150 --> 02:12:28.709
but there has to be something in that file

1575
02:12:28.710 --> 02:12:30.843
that says that she didn't do anything.

1576
02:12:30.844 --> 02:12:32.089
- Ma'am.
- That she was

1577
02:12:32.090 --> 02:12:33.586
under the influence of.
- Ma'am.

1578
02:12:33.587 --> 02:12:37.109
Ma'am. what I'm trying to tell you is that

1579
02:12:37.110 --> 02:12:38.639
there's nothing in here

1580
02:12:38.640 --> 02:12:41.293
that shows that your sister killed anyone.

1581
02:12:42.740 --> 02:12:43.869
There's no evidence in here

1582
02:12:43.870 --> 02:12:45.970
that shows that your sister killed anyone.

1583
02:12:49.860 --> 02:12:54.860
Now we have three missing
kids. Peter. Cody and Alex.

1584
02:12:55.720 --> 02:12:58.069
they've been missing for two weeks.

1585
02:12:58.070 --> 02:12:59.939
Now we don't know if
they're dead or alive.

1586
02:12:59.940 --> 02:13:04.609
but this morning we got a
call from Boulder. Colorado.

1587
02:13:04.610 --> 02:13:07.259
from someone who swears they saw someone

1588
02:13:07.260 --> 02:13:10.273
that fits the exact
description of Peter Stevenson.

1589
02:13:13.690 --> 02:13:15.109
We're just waiting for confirmation

1590
02:13:15.110 --> 02:13:16.560
about his identity right now.

1591
02:13:18.690 --> 02:13:20.113
And as far as Elizabeth.

1592
02:13:21.420 --> 02:13:23.610
she is at her house right now

1593
02:13:24.540 --> 02:13:26.913
with your own mother alive.

1594
02:13:28.440 --> 02:13:29.653
- That's not possible.

1595
02:13:30.943 --> 02:13:32.843
- I don't know what to tell you. Ma'am

1596
02:13:38.830 --> 02:13:42.723
Look. you have no history
of psychotic behavior.

1597
02:13:46.380 --> 02:13:47.439
nor does your fiance.

1598
02:13:47.440 --> 02:13:50.379
who I believe works at
the Sheriff's Department.

1599
02:13:50.380 --> 02:13:51.713
Neither does Mr. Miller.

1600
02:13:53.970 --> 02:13:56.269
I believe you just had
some traumatic experience

1601
02:13:56.270 --> 02:13:58.320
that you're not willing to share with us.

1602
02:13:59.610 --> 02:14:03.043
Therefore. I'm gonna suggest a therapist.

1603
02:14:08.070 --> 02:14:09.543
Please give him a call.

1604
02:14:13.870 --> 02:14:15.029
- Thank you.

1605
02:14:15.030 --> 02:14:16.409
- You're welcome.

1606
02:14:16.410 --> 02:14:17.410
Show you out.

1607
02:14:24.340 --> 02:14:27.059
Officer Austin. please show her out.

1608
02:14:27.060 --> 02:14:28.060
Thank you.

1609
02:14:38.630 --> 02:14:39.893
- Squeaky chair.

1610
02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:50.353
Spirits. demons.

1611
02:14:55.720 --> 02:14:57.020
It's very hard to believe.

1612
02:15:04.713 --> 02:15:08.478
Well.

1613
02:15:08.479 --> 02:15:09.896
I gotta find out.

1614
02:15:22.958 --> 02:15:24.800
- I really wish it didn't
have to be this way.

1615
02:15:24.801 --> 02:15:27.128
but I think with you being
gone for a little while.

1616
02:15:27.129 --> 02:15:29.378
this whole thing might
be over pretty quickly.

1617
02:15:29.379 --> 02:15:32.010
This whole thing may work
itself out pretty quickly.

1618
02:15:32.011 --> 02:15:33.821
- I hope so.
- Yeah.

1619
02:15:47.610 --> 02:15:49.329
- You will call me if you hear

1620
02:15:49.330 --> 02:15:51.282
from any of the missing people. right?

1621
02:15:51.283 --> 02:15:53.707
- You bet.

1622
02:15:53.708 --> 02:15:54.775
- Thank you.

1623
02:15:54.776 --> 02:15:55.928
- You're welcome.

1624
02:15:55.929 --> 02:15:56.929
Come here.

1625
02:15:59.576 --> 02:16:01.409
- We should get going.

1626
02:16:03.643 --> 02:16:05.976
I think we should get going.

1627
02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:08.800
- Yeah.

1628
02:16:09.630 --> 02:16:10.579
- Bye Father Dave.

1629
02:16:10.580 --> 02:16:11.580
- Bye.

1630
02:16:24.570 --> 02:16:25.570
- You drive.

1631
02:16:39.680 --> 02:16:40.680
- God help her.

1632
02:16:50.452 --> 02:16:52.952
She says your child. not mine.

1633
02:16:56.099 --> 02:16:57.354
Not mine.

1634
02:17:28.137 --> 02:17:29.137
- You okay?

1635
02:17:31.440 --> 02:17:33.603
- I don't think I'll ever be okay again.

1636
02:17:38.340 --> 02:17:41.333
- Yeah. I understand.

1637
02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:46.803
You know. it's funny though.

1638
02:17:50.270 --> 02:17:51.270
- What?

1639
02:17:52.470 --> 02:17:57.079
- I don't know. it just
seemed very coincidental.

1640
02:17:57.080 --> 02:18:00.023
I mean. almost very nicely set up.

1641
02:18:01.230 --> 02:18:02.449
almost too good to be true.

1642
02:18:02.450 --> 02:18:07.282
like Father Dave just happened
to know that old language.

1643
02:18:07.283 --> 02:18:08.115
what was it?

1644
02:18:08.116 --> 02:18:09.169
Hebrew or whatever.

1645
02:18:09.170 --> 02:18:11.819
from the old biblical times or something.

1646
02:18:11.820 --> 02:18:15.849
I mean. he just happened
to know that language.

1647
02:18:15.850 --> 02:18:17.809
And then the message.

1648
02:18:17.810 --> 02:18:20.159
something about the chosen one

1649
02:18:20.160 --> 02:18:21.719
being the target or something.

1650
02:18:21.720 --> 02:18:24.629
I mean. talking about
how cliche that sounds.

1651
02:18:24.630 --> 02:18:26.399
I mean. I don't know.

1652
02:18:26.400 --> 02:18:28.039
it just sounded a little
too good to be true.

1653
02:18:28.040 --> 02:18:30.799
almost like he was setting
us up or something.

1654
02:18:30.800 --> 02:18:31.809
I don't know.

1655
02:18:31.810 --> 02:18:33.949
Maybe it's just me. I don't know.

1656
02:18:33.950 --> 02:18:37.319
- Well. I completely understand. you know.

1657
02:18:37.320 --> 02:18:39.419
your concern under the circumstances.

1658
02:18:39.420 --> 02:18:43.979
but priests do have to learn Hebrew.

1659
02:18:43.980 --> 02:18:46.569
so. you know. there's
nothing weird about that.

1660
02:18:46.570 --> 02:18:50.079
And trust me. Father Dave is the only one

1661
02:18:50.080 --> 02:18:52.873
we can trust right now. I promise.

1662
02:18:55.882 --> 02:18:58.634
Well. hope you're right.

1663
02:19:09.324 --> 02:19:10.574
- Unbelievable.

1664
02:19:13.010 --> 02:19:14.244
- Can you read this?

1665
02:19:14.245 --> 02:19:15.245
- Yes I can.

1666
02:19:16.118 --> 02:19:17.118
Yes I can.

1667
02:19:20.080 --> 02:19:21.059
- Great.

1668
02:19:21.060 --> 02:19:22.060
What does it say?

1669
02:19:23.190 --> 02:19:24.809
- Joel.

1670
02:19:24.810 --> 02:19:25.810
Yeah.

1671
02:19:27.520 --> 02:19:30.170
- How did you know what the
message said on the wall?

1672
02:19:31.750 --> 02:19:33.931
Father Dave never told us.

1673
02:19:38.935 --> 02:19:39.935
Joel.
