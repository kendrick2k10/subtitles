00:00:29.714 --> 00:00:31.148
<i>Please slow down.</i>

4
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.117
<i>Slow down!</i>

5
00:00:36.754 --> 00:00:37.855
What is wrong with you?

6
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.360
What are you doing?
Just please drive slower.

7
00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:47.832
Are you crazy?!

8
00:01:01.545 --> 00:01:02.847
Hmm.

9
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.318
This is a difficult
situation.

10
00:01:09.687 --> 00:01:12.155
Your eyes are getting worse.

11
00:01:17.562 --> 00:01:19.329
Come. sit.

12
00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:31.843
I'm afraid that our modern medicine is
totally helpless against this disease.

13
00:01:31.876 --> 00:01:39.483
I'm going to write you a prescription for some
medication. but this will only delay the deterioration.

14
00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:40.785
That's it.

15
00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:46.824
I'm sorry to say this.

16
00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.864
but someday soon.
you will lose your vision.

17
00:01:59.503 --> 00:02:01.739
It... it could
have been much worse.

18
00:02:01.773 --> 00:02:04.241
Think about people with
cancer and know they're dying.

19
00:02:04.274 --> 00:02:05.442
At least you have life.

20
00:02:07.277 --> 00:02:09.379
- Say something!
- What do you want me to say?

21
00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:12.650
He's not the only
doctor in the city.

22
00:02:12.684 --> 00:02:15.853
What if he's wrong?
We'll find another doctor.

23
00:02:15.887 --> 00:02:16.954
Another doctor?

24
00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.825
Look. I can't be helped!

25
00:02:21.893 --> 00:02:23.561
And what can't be helped.
can't be helped.

26
00:02:23.594 --> 00:02:25.295
and you're talking
about a miracle doctor.

27
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.398
- Come on. don't pity me.
- Why are you yelling at me?

28
00:02:28.432 --> 00:02:30.001
I'm not yelling.
I'm just talking.

29
00:02:30.034 --> 00:02:32.603
- People don't talk like that.
- Yeah. Well. I do!

30
00:02:32.637 --> 00:02:33.905
Since when?

31
00:02:41.344 --> 00:02:43.246
I don't even
know why you're here.

32
00:02:44.615 --> 00:02:47.284
I don't even know why
you're... why you're with me.

33
00:02:47.317 --> 00:02:49.352
No. don't wait until
I go blind so you could. what.

34
00:02:49.386 --> 00:02:50.688
just take care of me?

35
00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:53.725
Look. especially
when I know that deep down

36
00:02:54.391 --> 00:02:55.626
you don't even give a damn.

37
00:02:56.661 --> 00:02:57.829
You have no shame.

38
00:02:58.963 --> 00:03:01.331
If that's what you think of me.
then why did you live

39
00:03:01.364 --> 00:03:03.500
with that for all these years?
Why didn't you say anything?

40
00:03:03.533 --> 00:03:04.635
Yeah. well. I did say something.

41
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.640
Just... just to my...
to myself.

42
00:03:11.341 --> 00:03:12.744
And now you spit out the truth.

43
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.447
Well. I've
no time for you either.

44
00:04:11.836 --> 00:04:12.904
Hey.

45
00:04:15.438 --> 00:04:17.008
Hey. Hey!

46
00:04:18.075 --> 00:04:21.746
Wake up.
It's the last stop.

47
00:04:23.413 --> 00:04:24.916
You can stay here if you want.

48
00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:26.884
but we'll head back
to the city in an hour.

49
00:04:51.976 --> 00:04:53.678
Did you miss your bus stop?

50
00:04:58.749 --> 00:05:00.450
No. it's been a rough day.

51
00:05:01.586 --> 00:05:02.820
Drink?

52
00:05:03.486 --> 00:05:07.091
Yeah. I don't drink.

53
00:05:07.124 --> 00:05:09.026
Well. you can't
smoke in the woods.

54
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.596
We've had seven fires
this year already.

55
00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:15.099
3.700 trees have burnt down.

56
00:05:15.132 --> 00:05:17.935
How do you know 3.700 trees?

57
00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:19.704
I'm an electrician.

58
00:05:19.737 --> 00:05:21.572
I have to work up high.

59
00:05:21.606 --> 00:05:25.042
I climb things.
so I see everything from above.

60
00:05:25.743 --> 00:05:28.579
Ah. Ah. so you're a god.

61
00:05:31.215 --> 00:05:32.884
Is he up there. too. is he?

62
00:05:32.917 --> 00:05:36.921
Oh. I'm not God.
but I work one step below him.

63
00:05:40.157 --> 00:05:42.760
But I've done my work for today.
so now I can drink.

64
00:05:49.033 --> 00:05:50.601
Where am I?

65
00:05:51.235 --> 00:05:53.436
Nowhere. really.

66
00:05:54.906 --> 00:05:56.707
But if you close your eyes...

67
00:05:58.709 --> 00:06:00.144
...you can be anywhere.

68
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.815
There's some beautiful trails.

69
00:06:06.817 --> 00:06:10.755
Go ahead.
Explore them whilst you can.

70
00:06:39.951 --> 00:06:42.086
Hey. are you okay?

71
00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:43.453
Did you hurt yourself?

72
00:06:46.057 --> 00:06:48.826
Here. come on.
Let me help you. Okay?

73
00:07:00.671 --> 00:07:03.708
- How did you get here?
- Uh. a... a bus.

74
00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:07.078
Yeah. a... a bus brought me here.

75
00:07:07.111 --> 00:07:08.779
And where are you going?

76
00:07:08.813 --> 00:07:12.750
Maybe here. or maybe
I was coming to help you.

77
00:07:12.783 --> 00:07:15.485
Well. thank you for helping me.

78
00:07:18.155 --> 00:07:21.592
Well. you should
probably come into the house.

79
00:07:22.893 --> 00:07:24.862
You're not dangerous. are you?

80
00:07:24.895 --> 00:07:26.764
Dangerous? No.

81
00:07:26.797 --> 00:07:29.600
- No.
- Well. I don't know.

82
00:07:29.633 --> 00:07:33.604
You could be a murderer.
a thief. maniac.

83
00:07:33.637 --> 00:07:37.908
Yeah. Well. fortunately for you.
I'm... I'm none of those things.

84
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:43.581
No. I'm just a man lost
in the forest.

85
00:07:44.949 --> 00:07:48.518
Good. Be my guest.

86
00:08:15.713 --> 00:08:16.781
Oh.

87
00:08:20.751 --> 00:08:24.021
You must be hungry.
so please eat.

88
00:08:25.156 --> 00:08:26.223
Don't be shy.

89
00:08:36.934 --> 00:08:39.904
Yeah. it's just I feel... I
feel a little bit uncomfortable.

90
00:08:39.937 --> 00:08:40.971
Why?

91
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.975
Well. it's just. you know.
since I was a kid I've got

92
00:08:45.009 --> 00:08:47.211
a little bit uncomfortable
when people watch me eat.

93
00:08:49.346 --> 00:08:51.115
Well. I can turn away.

94
00:09:11.335 --> 00:09:12.636
Do you like it?

95
00:09:17.441 --> 00:09:21.011
Mm. Oh. it's good.

96
00:09:21.745 --> 00:09:22.913
Really. it's very good.

97
00:09:30.087 --> 00:09:32.990
You're eating
Raspberry Angel cake.

98
00:09:33.924 --> 00:09:35.860
Ah. raspberries.

99
00:09:37.027 --> 00:09:39.697
Peddlers used to sell them
in the market when I was young.

100
00:09:39.964 --> 00:09:43.033
Yeah. they were always shouting.
"raspberries.

101
00:09:43.067 --> 00:09:45.069
Raspberries.
get your raspberries."

102
00:09:45.102 --> 00:09:47.071
Do you remember?

103
00:09:49.173 --> 00:09:50.407
I remember.

104
00:10:06.056 --> 00:10:07.424
You know.
I have to say I've never

105
00:10:07.458 --> 00:10:08.959
eaten in a such
a strange manner before.

106
00:10:10.194 --> 00:10:11.929
Well. you wanted to be
comfortable.

107
00:10:18.102 --> 00:10:20.671
You know. are... are these. uh...
are these all your painting?

108
00:10:21.438 --> 00:10:22.706
Yeah.

109
00:10:24.742 --> 00:10:26.010
Well. they're beautiful.

110
00:10:27.011 --> 00:10:28.078
Thank you.

111
00:10:31.348 --> 00:10:32.850
Tell me
something about yourself.

112
00:10:33.984 --> 00:10:38.956
Well. um. I... I'm a bartender.

113
00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:43.894
Uh... yeah. well. really
my passion's architecture.

114
00:10:44.395 --> 00:10:46.931
For years. I've been
working on a... on a new concept

115
00:10:46.964 --> 00:10:48.766
that's gonna transform
cities all over the world.

116
00:10:50.067 --> 00:10:55.039
It's just. well.
no one will believe in me.

117
00:10:55.539 --> 00:10:57.007
I believe in you.

118
00:12:09.146 --> 00:12:10.481
No. No.

119
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:16.453
Sorry. I can't.

120
00:12:18.355 --> 00:12:19.557
Not like this.

121
00:12:21.959 --> 00:12:23.027
I'm not ready.

122
00:12:24.461 --> 00:12:26.096
No. I'm... I'm sorry.

123
00:12:26.497 --> 00:12:28.432
Look. I apologize
if I did anything. I...

124
00:12:30.267 --> 00:12:31.335
don't apologize.

125
00:12:33.605 --> 00:12:37.308
Tell me... was it good?

126
00:12:42.346 --> 00:12:43.414
What. the cake?

127
00:12:46.584 --> 00:12:50.154
Yes. the cake.

128
00:12:58.128 --> 00:13:00.497
Uh. it... it was delicious.
Th... thank you.

129
00:13:10.541 --> 00:13:14.011
L... look. I should...
I should probably go.

130
00:13:18.982 --> 00:13:21.185
Okay. guest.

131
00:13:24.054 --> 00:13:25.289
You'll come again. right?

132
00:13:27.358 --> 00:13:29.093
Oh. I... I... I don't know.

133
00:13:32.996 --> 00:13:34.264
I don't even
know your name.

134
00:13:36.701 --> 00:13:38.035
What is your name?

135
00:13:39.704 --> 00:13:41.038
I don't have a name.

136
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:48.078
I... I see.

137
00:13:50.214 --> 00:13:53.951
You don't want to tell
me and that's... that's fine.

138
00:13:53.984 --> 00:13:55.052
No.

139
00:13:57.154 --> 00:13:58.489
I really have no name.

140
00:14:01.291 --> 00:14:02.459
Well. how come?

141
00:14:05.429 --> 00:14:07.398
Let us both be called nothing.

142
00:14:09.233 --> 00:14:12.102
Believe me.
it's better that way.

143
00:15:22.139 --> 00:15:23.240
I thought you'd left.

144
00:15:24.475 --> 00:15:25.577
I went to the pharmacy.

145
00:15:35.753 --> 00:15:38.155
One in the morning.
one at night.

146
00:15:44.228 --> 00:15:47.097
Uh. look. I wanted to
apologize for yesterday.

147
00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:48.566
You know. I wasn't feeling well.

148
00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.668
I was only trying
to be there for you.

149
00:15:50.702 --> 00:15:52.302
Yeah. well.
you let me go off alone.

150
00:15:52.336 --> 00:15:53.571
<i>You let me go off alone.</i>

151
00:15:54.772 --> 00:15:57.541
Yeah. we... you always go off
like that when you're upset.

152
00:15:57.575 --> 00:16:00.244
- There you go again.
- Come on. look. not again.

153
00:16:00.277 --> 00:16:02.580
All right. please. Look. I d...
I don't have the will

154
00:16:02.614 --> 00:16:03.715
or the time for this.

155
00:16:04.782 --> 00:16:08.185
What if you did have the time.
what would you do?

156
00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:10.287
Would we still be married?

157
00:16:12.456 --> 00:16:16.694
Answer me.
Would you be living with me?

158
00:16:25.737 --> 00:16:27.672
Can't you leave
it alone just for once?

159
00:16:28.773 --> 00:16:30.107
Huh. look.
I woke up this morning.

160
00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.441
and you weren't even there.

161
00:16:31.475 --> 00:16:33.443
Can you imagine how that felt?

162
00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:36.648
Take the medication.

163
00:16:37.715 --> 00:16:40.384
Even if it gives you a day.
or a month. or a year.

164
00:16:40.417 --> 00:16:42.519
then you could
prepare for your future.

165
00:16:42.554 --> 00:16:44.722
whatever or with whoever
that might be.

166
00:16:49.192 --> 00:16:50.762
All right. look.
I'm just trying to pull myself

167
00:16:50.795 --> 00:16:52.095
together here. okay?

168
00:16:53.163 --> 00:16:55.432
Now. please. just come and help
me on my sketches.

169
00:16:57.501 --> 00:16:59.536
Once I'm blind.
I'm not gonna be able to work.

170
00:16:59.571 --> 00:17:01.338
You really
think you can make money

171
00:17:01.371 --> 00:17:02.740
from your kind of architecture?

172
00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:08.378
No. don't talk to me like that.

173
00:17:25.395 --> 00:17:26.698
I thought a lot about yesterday.

174
00:17:29.834 --> 00:17:34.271
You spent your whole life hoping
and dreaming for something else.

175
00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:38.710
You need to realize
that you're lying to yourself.

176
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:41.545
and you're lying to me.

177
00:17:45.449 --> 00:17:47.284
That's exactly
why I have to do this.

178
00:18:05.202 --> 00:18:06.236
I'm late for work.

179
00:18:08.773 --> 00:18:09.907
It's your decision.

180
00:18:59.757 --> 00:19:03.493
Son.
bring me another ax.

181
00:19:11.535 --> 00:19:14.538
Continue chopping.
I want this finished.

182
00:19:16.339 --> 00:19:18.508
Now. Go.

183
00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.635
Stop!

184
00:19:45.937 --> 00:19:48.371
What kind of man are you?

185
00:19:48.873 --> 00:19:50.675
Where is your strength?

186
00:19:52.009 --> 00:19:53.778
I'm not gonna help you

187
00:19:53.811 --> 00:19:56.013
even if you don't finish
'til the morning.

188
00:19:56.047 --> 00:19:57.715
I'm gonna make you into a man

189
00:19:57.749 --> 00:19:59.483
or drown you in the river.
you understand?

190
00:19:59.516 --> 00:20:01.719
What are you doing? Stop!

191
00:20:01.753 --> 00:20:03.721
He's a young boy.
he can't do this.

192
00:20:04.354 --> 00:20:06.523
I wish I knew what he can do.

193
00:20:07.324 --> 00:20:09.660
He draws well
and he studies well.

194
00:20:09.694 --> 00:20:13.463
Drawing will
not support this house.

195
00:20:13.865 --> 00:20:17.802
We need a man. not a Da Vinci.

196
00:20:17.835 --> 00:20:20.470
Please. he... he's
doing the best he can.

197
00:20:21.572 --> 00:20:22.974
Come here. let me see.

198
00:20:34.417 --> 00:20:36.453
You know. pretty soon
I'm not gonna be able to work.

199
00:20:36.486 --> 00:20:39.456
I'll help you. I'll give you
a third of me salary.

200
00:20:40.457 --> 00:20:42.693
- And what salary?
- But I will. though. won't I?

201
00:20:43.728 --> 00:20:44.595
Never.

202
00:20:46.764 --> 00:20:48.365
Come on. man.
Let's go to the strip bar

203
00:20:48.398 --> 00:20:49.734
while you can still see.

204
00:20:49.767 --> 00:20:51.434
Lots of big tits and asses.

205
00:20:52.435 --> 00:20:54.705
Oh. I forgot
you're a faithful married

206
00:20:54.739 --> 00:20:56.439
husband and don't go
to places like that.

207
00:20:58.408 --> 00:20:59.777
Let's go to the movies
then or something.

208
00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:01.913
Some place you're gonna
miss when you're blind.

209
00:21:03.147 --> 00:21:04.715
Just don't
take me to that museum.

210
00:21:15.092 --> 00:21:17.061
You need to realize
that nothing is a tragedy.

211
00:21:18.495 --> 00:21:19.797
except perhaps this
exhibit hall.

212
00:21:20.832 --> 00:21:23.000
Sooner or later we'll
all be blind in our graves.

213
00:21:23.801 --> 00:21:25.736
Yeah. well.
that's easy for you to say.

214
00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:26.904
You're not
the one who's going blind.

215
00:21:29.006 --> 00:21:32.475
And despite your philosophy.
yeah. you'd be in a panic.

216
00:21:32.509 --> 00:21:35.046
- No. I wouldn't. I'd laugh.
- Oh. really?

217
00:21:35.079 --> 00:21:37.048
What. you wouldn't cry
at my funeral?

218
00:21:38.749 --> 00:21:39.917
I would if you wanted me to.

219
00:21:41.018 --> 00:21:42.385
What would it matter to you?

220
00:21:43.453 --> 00:21:45.422
Everybody dies in the end.
that's the bottom line.

221
00:21:46.657 --> 00:21:48.425
Isn't that how every
Shakespeare play ends?

222
00:21:49.927 --> 00:21:51.863
Yeah. since when have you
read shakespeare?

223
00:21:51.896 --> 00:21:53.396
I watched a documentary.

224
00:22:17.121 --> 00:22:19.522
Yeah. you know. the truth
is that life is a tragedy.

225
00:22:21.058 --> 00:22:24.427
I should have been born
in the '70s in America.

226
00:22:24.962 --> 00:22:27.865
now that was the greatest period
in the history of our planet.

227
00:22:29.133 --> 00:22:32.003
Yeah. the music they played.
the people that lived there.

228
00:22:32.036 --> 00:22:34.639
the films they made.
the sexual freedom.

229
00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.842
I think even the air
was different back then.

230
00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:41.012
How can you love a country
when you were never there?

231
00:22:42.512 --> 00:22:45.983
Yeah. you know. sometimes
I... I just close my eyes

232
00:22:47.952 --> 00:22:50.054
and I... and I imagine
that I'm there.

233
00:22:52.857 --> 00:22:54.592
Now... now that I'm blind.
I know I'm never gonna

234
00:22:54.625 --> 00:22:55.760
to be able to see it.

235
00:23:04.969 --> 00:23:08.105
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah. no.

236
00:23:08.139 --> 00:23:10.841
I just can't...
can't quite see anything.

237
00:23:11.642 --> 00:23:12.509
Oh.

238
00:23:14.011 --> 00:23:16.714
- I... I can't see anything.
- What. nothing?

239
00:23:16.747 --> 00:23:19.482
No. I'm serious. I... I can't see
anything. What's happening?

240
00:23:19.516 --> 00:23:21.585
- I'm... I'm here. Calm down.
- What's happening?

241
00:23:21.619 --> 00:23:23.254
- I can't... I can't see anything.
- I'm here. I'm here. Chill.

242
00:23:23.287 --> 00:23:26.523
I feel like I'm bli...

243
00:23:26.557 --> 00:23:28.059
You bastard!

244
00:23:28.092 --> 00:23:29.760
- Oh. what? You scared?
- Yes. I was.

245
00:23:29.794 --> 00:23:31.228
You scared. were you?
What. I thought you said

246
00:23:31.262 --> 00:23:32.763
everything was gonna
be all right.

247
00:23:32.797 --> 00:23:35.099
I exaggerated.
That wasn't funny!

248
00:23:44.875 --> 00:23:46.978
So. will you keep seeing things
or just see nothing

249
00:23:47.011 --> 00:23:48.579
- all of a sudden?
- I don't know.

250
00:23:52.116 --> 00:23:53.751
Yeah. I guess it would just be...

251
00:23:54.986 --> 00:23:56.721
be like a snap.

252
00:23:58.823 --> 00:24:02.193
And suddenly everything would
just... just disappear.

253
00:24:03.728 --> 00:24:05.196
I just love museums.

254
00:24:05.796 --> 00:24:10.034
I love them. They're me favorite
thing. Love art. Love art.

255
00:24:47.838 --> 00:24:50.875
- What's wrong with you?
- Look. I'm... I'm seeing things.

256
00:24:50.908 --> 00:24:52.643
What do you mean.
I thought you were going blind?

257
00:24:52.676 --> 00:24:54.211
No. no. no. they're things
I'm not supposed to see.

258
00:24:54.245 --> 00:24:55.813
I don't understand.

259
00:24:57.148 --> 00:25:00.184
Listen. I... I need
you to do me a favor.

260
00:25:00.985 --> 00:25:02.653
Look. I... I met a girl.

261
00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:05.589
I need you to give her this
before something happens to me.

262
00:25:05.623 --> 00:25:08.125
Girl? I thought you're
faithful to your wife.

263
00:25:08.159 --> 00:25:09.994
No. please.
All right. if you're my friend.

264
00:25:10.027 --> 00:25:11.629
you... you'll find
her and you'll give her this.

265
00:25:11.662 --> 00:25:12.797
Just call her on the phone.

266
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:14.632
No. she lives in the forest

267
00:25:14.665 --> 00:25:16.133
outside of the city and...
and I don't have her number.

268
00:25:18.035 --> 00:25:21.739
Look. yeah. take the 102 bus
to the last stop. All right.

269
00:25:21.772 --> 00:25:23.174
follow the path through
the woods to her house.

270
00:25:23.207 --> 00:25:24.942
You'll find her.
There's a bird house

271
00:25:24.975 --> 00:25:27.144
and a big tree and... and a dog.
a German Shepherd.

272
00:25:27.178 --> 00:25:28.579
It... it's a beautiful place.

273
00:25:30.081 --> 00:25:31.615
Are you dreaming a fairly tale?

274
00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:37.021
Just promise me. I need
to see her before it's too late.

275
00:25:37.755 --> 00:25:38.823
What's her name?

276
00:25:41.792 --> 00:25:42.860
I don't know.

277
00:25:46.297 --> 00:25:48.732
Bitch.
it's fine if you don't want to.

278
00:25:50.835 --> 00:25:53.637
The Ambassador
is ready to see you now.

279
00:25:54.138 --> 00:25:55.206
Thank you.

280
00:26:06.417 --> 00:26:12.723
Um. I'd like a word.
Take a seat.

281
00:26:18.362 --> 00:26:19.930
Would you like a drink?

282
00:26:41.051 --> 00:26:44.688
Have you told your husband
that you work for me?

283
00:26:44.722 --> 00:26:47.091
No. Not yet.

284
00:26:47.791 --> 00:26:50.261
Are you embarrassed to tell
him that you're a housekeeper?

285
00:26:50.995 --> 00:26:52.696
He doesn't
know about all my jobs.

286
00:26:53.831 --> 00:26:56.233
He thinks I don't care.
I go out every night.

287
00:26:57.434 --> 00:26:59.970
He only approaches me
when I come home 'cause I drink.

288
00:27:04.508 --> 00:27:05.943
He's lucky to have you.

289
00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:10.915
In another life...

290
00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:15.386
We probably would have
been very good friends.

291
00:27:23.961 --> 00:27:26.163
If you like.
I can give you extra hours.

292
00:27:27.831 --> 00:27:30.501
I can offer you double
what your other jobs pay you.

293
00:27:30.534 --> 00:27:31.802
Yes. of course.

294
00:27:36.407 --> 00:27:40.778
Great.
We'll add Thursdays.

295
00:27:41.278 --> 00:27:42.346
Thank you.

296
00:27:48.419 --> 00:27:51.956
Of course the real question is.
do you love him?

297
00:27:54.325 --> 00:27:59.029
Not just what's on the outside.
what's on the inside.

298
00:28:03.934 --> 00:28:05.436
Otherwise.
you're just roommates.

299
00:28:17.448 --> 00:28:18.849
Fucking bastard.

300
00:28:47.511 --> 00:28:49.313
Hello. is anybody there?!

301
00:28:58.556 --> 00:29:03.360
I've got a letter...
from a friend.

302
00:29:22.079 --> 00:29:24.515
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

303
00:29:24.548 --> 00:29:26.317
Nice doggie. Stay there.
stay there and...

304
00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:28.018
Fuck off of me.

305
00:31:00.043 --> 00:31:01.211
I said I can't meet you.

306
00:31:04.014 --> 00:31:06.651
'Cause he's really sick.

307
00:31:09.253 --> 00:31:11.121
Why aren't you more concerned?

308
00:31:14.759 --> 00:31:19.963
I don't know when.
Maybe never. I don't know.

309
00:31:23.735 --> 00:31:28.005
<i>♪ I remember the day ♪</i>

310
00:31:28.505 --> 00:31:34.612

312
00:31:41.418 --> 00:31:44.188
- Here. Cover for me.
- Sure.

313
00:31:44.221 --> 00:31:45.289
Hey.

314
00:31:47.257 --> 00:31:48.325
You came.

315
00:31:50.394 --> 00:31:53.430
Well. I was invited.

316
00:31:58.535 --> 00:32:01.205
I've saved
a seat for you. please.

317
00:32:09.246 --> 00:32:11.048
So can I. uh...
can I get you a drink?

318
00:32:12.617 --> 00:32:15.753
A glass of cold water.

319
00:32:18.422 --> 00:32:19.557
Right. of course.

320
00:32:19.591 --> 00:32:22.259

323
00:32:36.608 --> 00:32:39.309
I wonder
how their futures will turn out.

324
00:32:42.246 --> 00:32:43.781
Or maybe they'll fall in love.

325
00:32:45.115 --> 00:32:48.018
Or maybe there'll be none.

326
00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:50.521
Why do you say that?

327
00:32:51.455 --> 00:32:53.323
Relationships are difficult.

328
00:32:56.794 --> 00:33:00.197
Everyone seems to be
an angel at first.

329
00:33:01.699 --> 00:33:03.568
and then the other side shows.

330
00:33:03.601 --> 00:33:08.105
Ah. the other side.
More like a bad side.

331
00:33:09.439 --> 00:33:11.141
What. do you have a bad side?

332
00:33:11.508 --> 00:33:13.110
Very bad one.

333
00:33:14.646 --> 00:33:16.280
What's your other side like?

334
00:33:18.115 --> 00:33:21.051
You know. sometimes
I find myself lying.

335
00:33:22.787 --> 00:33:23.855
Yeah. I can't help myself.

336
00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:30.160
Yeah. I think I lie to
accept the person I've become.

337
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:34.666
Yeah. mostly I lie
just to hide from the person

338
00:33:34.699 --> 00:33:36.166
I know I'm supposed to be.

339
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:42.072
In many ways we're alike.

340
00:33:43.808 --> 00:33:45.275
Why are we alike?

341
00:33:45.309 --> 00:33:48.145
I mean.
you know. you live alone.

342
00:33:48.178 --> 00:33:49.881
You... you don't
have to answer to anybody.

343
00:33:49.914 --> 00:33:51.281
I mean. me I...

344
00:33:53.483 --> 00:33:55.853
Yeah. I live an illusion.

345
00:33:58.656 --> 00:34:00.357
And I don't wanna lie to you.

346
00:34:03.561 --> 00:34:04.796
Everybody lies.

347
00:34:05.495 --> 00:34:06.698
Oh. even you?

348
00:34:09.701 --> 00:34:10.768
Even me.

349
00:34:14.839 --> 00:34:19.409
Well. I think that I should
tell you that I. uh...

350
00:34:20.344 --> 00:34:21.511
I'm married.

351
00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:23.715
I have a wife.

352
00:34:28.853 --> 00:34:30.622
Is that
what's bothering you?

353
00:34:36.561 --> 00:34:38.295
We've done nothing wrong.

354
00:34:38.328 --> 00:34:40.665
Right now we're just
sharing a glass of water.

355
00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:44.267
Oh. it's true.

356
00:34:49.373 --> 00:34:54.612
It seems like I'm...
solo again.

357
00:34:55.212 --> 00:34:57.314
My husband has other plans.

358
00:35:02.252 --> 00:35:05.188
Don't worry.
I'll take care of everything.

359
00:35:07.859 --> 00:35:08.926
Thank you.

360
00:35:10.762 --> 00:35:12.864
Um. here's your salary.

361
00:35:21.906 --> 00:35:23.841
Um. it's late.

362
00:35:25.509 --> 00:35:29.346
I have plenty of spare
rooms if you should choose

363
00:35:29.379 --> 00:35:30.581
to spare the night.

364
00:35:34.518 --> 00:35:40.257

368
00:35:55.372 --> 00:35:56.239
Me. too.

369
00:35:57.675 --> 00:36:01.879
Sometimes I really
believe that I'm nobody.

370
00:36:04.649 --> 00:36:07.551
We are nobody.

371
00:36:09.319 --> 00:36:10.520
That's who we are.

372
00:36:13.725 --> 00:36:16.661
Although I have to say.
I can't help but wonder.

373
00:36:19.063 --> 00:36:22.700
It's okay.
Don't worry.

374
00:36:23.735 --> 00:36:25.837
Soon everything
will be revealed.

375
00:36:27.739 --> 00:36:30.540
Nothing will be concealed.

376
00:36:33.945 --> 00:36:36.647
You are a strange girl.

377
00:36:37.715 --> 00:36:39.382
Stranger than you think.

378
00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:47.390
I wanna be with you.

379
00:36:49.359 --> 00:36:50.460

383
00:37:06.077 --> 00:37:07.377
They'll worry for you.

384
00:37:08.846 --> 00:37:10.681
Uh. le... let me take you home.

385
00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:15.485
If you do you'll have
to stay the night.

386
00:37:15.519 --> 00:37:18.455
No. no. I wouldn't.
I wouldn't have to stay.

387
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:22.794
If you leave.
you'll be eaten by jackals.

388
00:37:30.534 --> 00:37:32.369
I really... I really
wanna see you again.

389
00:37:34.739 --> 00:37:36.073
You know where to find me.

390
00:37:38.843 --> 00:37:40.343
What if I can't anymore?

391
00:37:40.377 --> 00:37:41.779
What if I can't find my way?

392
00:37:43.413 --> 00:37:45.883
There are many ways to find me.

398
00:38:51.548 --> 00:38:56.486
No. no. no.
no. no. no. no. no. no.

399
00:38:56.519 --> 00:38:58.723
No!

400
00:38:58.756 --> 00:39:00.892
You... you...
what have you done?

401
00:39:00.925 --> 00:39:02.126
What have you done?

402
00:39:06.764 --> 00:39:09.567
Oh. please. Oh. my God.

403
00:40:17.735 --> 00:40:23.975
One. two. three. four.

404
00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:27.144
One...

405
00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:34.685
...13. 14. 15.

406
00:40:48.566 --> 00:40:53.904
Seven. six.

407
00:40:53.938 --> 00:40:56.741
five. four.

408
00:40:58.976 --> 00:41:04.248
three. two. one.

409
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:20.357
Are you hiding from us?

410
00:42:30.801 --> 00:42:31.869
What is this?

411
00:43:38.435 --> 00:43:39.837
Who beat you this time?

412
00:43:40.437 --> 00:43:42.106
Probably the same
boys in the village.

413
00:43:44.408 --> 00:43:47.011
What's that?
What's on your face?

414
00:43:48.445 --> 00:43:50.047
Lipstick.

415
00:43:51.782 --> 00:43:53.417
The boys
wiped lipstick on my face.

416
00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:55.085
Who did it?

417
00:43:58.756 --> 00:44:00.357
Who did it?

418
00:44:09.767 --> 00:44:10.868
Get out.

419
00:44:13.137 --> 00:44:14.205
Please get up.

420
00:44:19.143 --> 00:44:22.279
Get up and get out.

421
00:44:23.247 --> 00:44:24.348
Now!

422
00:44:26.817 --> 00:44:28.285
- You're a disgrace...
- Son?

423
00:44:28.319 --> 00:44:29.987
...to this family. Hold still.

424
00:44:30.988 --> 00:44:33.090
We'll see how far he can go.

425
00:45:26.143 --> 00:45:28.545
<i>Hey. do you want to play?</i>

426
00:45:38.522 --> 00:45:39.790
Where am I?

427
00:45:42.526 --> 00:45:44.028
I can't give you this.

428
00:45:45.129 --> 00:45:46.530
It's too heavy.

429
00:45:48.899 --> 00:45:50.401
But I'll carry it for you.

430
00:45:52.136 --> 00:45:55.406
Don't worry. I asked them.

431
00:45:57.308 --> 00:45:59.043
And they said it would be okay.

432
00:46:35.479 --> 00:46:36.547
Who are they?

433
00:46:39.416 --> 00:46:40.618
Heavy people.

434
00:46:42.486 --> 00:46:45.989
Heavy? They're so thin.

435
00:46:48.258 --> 00:46:50.628
The weight is in those balloons.

436
00:46:52.062 --> 00:46:54.531
The weight
of all their suffering.

437
00:46:56.934 --> 00:46:58.570
And what
are they suffering from?

438
00:47:01.538 --> 00:47:02.607
Don't you know?

439
00:47:10.147 --> 00:47:11.982
And why is your balloon
so small?

440
00:47:17.354 --> 00:47:18.422
Wait.

441
00:47:20.592 --> 00:47:21.892
It's mine. isn't it?

442
00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:23.927
Yes.

443
00:47:26.397 --> 00:47:28.399
Please. give it to me.

444
00:47:30.568 --> 00:47:34.171
I told you.
It's too heavy for you to carry.

445
00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:43.914
Soon.
everything will be revealed.

446
00:47:46.016 --> 00:47:48.452
Nothing will be concealed.

447
00:48:29.627 --> 00:48:31.361
Wha... what is it?

448
00:48:31.395 --> 00:48:33.430
- Oh God. it's happened.
- What are you doing?

449
00:48:33.464 --> 00:48:35.065
I... I have to count.

450
00:48:35.098 --> 00:48:36.601
- Two. three.
- Well. stop and come back.

451
00:48:36.634 --> 00:48:38.368
You'll hurt yourself.
you'll hurt yourself.

452
00:48:38.402 --> 00:48:39.536
It's happened. I'm blind!

453
00:48:39.571 --> 00:48:42.272
Shh. it's okay. It's okay.

454
00:48:42.306 --> 00:48:43.373
- Oh. God.
- It's okay.

455
00:48:43.407 --> 00:48:44.508
- Oh. God.
- It's okay.

456
00:48:44.541 --> 00:48:46.043
I should've listened to you.

457
00:48:46.076 --> 00:48:47.411
I... I should've
taken the pill.

458
00:48:47.444 --> 00:48:49.246
- Calm down.
- It's happened.

459
00:48:50.047 --> 00:48:52.249
- Please. it's happened.
- It's okay.

460
00:48:52.282 --> 00:48:53.550
Yes. it's happened.

461
00:48:53.585 --> 00:48:56.220
Oh. I've made so many mistakes.

462
00:48:57.254 --> 00:48:59.591
And I blamed you
for all of my suffering.

463
00:49:01.058 --> 00:49:02.092
God.

464
00:49:02.827 --> 00:49:04.696
No. we've seen so much.

465
00:49:04.729 --> 00:49:07.431
We have. we've seen so much.

466
00:49:09.567 --> 00:49:11.101
We're roommates.

467
00:49:12.604 --> 00:49:13.671
What?

468
00:49:16.641 --> 00:49:18.141
Nothing. Nothing.

469
00:49:24.314 --> 00:49:28.285
Wait. Wait. I... I...
I see something.

470
00:49:29.554 --> 00:49:34.458
Oh. it's a meadow.

471
00:49:37.227 --> 00:49:39.329
Oh. it's beautiful.

472
00:49:39.597 --> 00:49:42.132
Meadow? We're home.

473
00:49:43.534 --> 00:49:45.637
Are you telling me
you can't see this?

474
00:49:46.503 --> 00:49:49.707
Come on.
Come on. open your eyes.

475
00:49:49.741 --> 00:49:51.809
Stop it. Stop it.

476
00:49:51.843 --> 00:49:53.745
Stop it. You're frightening me.

477
00:49:53.778 --> 00:49:56.513
How can you not see this?

478
00:50:02.519 --> 00:50:04.354
This got real.
You're acting really crazy.

479
00:50:09.561 --> 00:50:12.062
I've never been more real about
anything in my life.

480
00:50:18.402 --> 00:50:19.837
Wait. do... do you hear that?

481
00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:23.808
Hear what?

482
00:50:23.841 --> 00:50:26.678
Shh.

483
00:50:29.714 --> 00:50:31.616
That sound.

484
00:50:33.718 --> 00:50:35.185
The sound of what?

485
00:50:41.191 --> 00:50:43.160
Sound of silence.

486
00:50:45.495 --> 00:50:47.765
How on earth can silence
have a sound?

487
00:50:51.803 --> 00:50:54.639
- It does. It does.
- No.

488
00:50:54.672 --> 00:50:56.306
It's a deafening sound.

489
00:50:57.909 --> 00:50:59.777
It's... it's... it's terrible.

490
00:50:59.811 --> 00:51:01.478
It's a deafening sound.

491
00:51:01.511 --> 00:51:02.647
No. No.

492
00:51:06.249 --> 00:51:07.585
What sound?

493
00:51:09.419 --> 00:51:10.888
What?

494
00:51:11.823 --> 00:51:12.890
What?

495
00:51:13.625 --> 00:51:15.192
Who are you?

496
00:51:15.225 --> 00:51:17.227
I'm your wife.

497
00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:18.796
I can't see you.

498
00:51:19.897 --> 00:51:21.933
I can't see your face.

499
00:51:21.966 --> 00:51:24.401
I can... I can see your body.

500
00:51:24.434 --> 00:51:26.838
but I can't see your face.

501
00:51:29.741 --> 00:51:31.541
Why can't I see your face?

502
00:51:48.693 --> 00:51:51.361
His consciousness
cannot accept the fact

503
00:51:51.395 --> 00:51:55.432
that he has lost his sight
so he is making up images.

504
00:51:55.465 --> 00:51:58.235
he's creating pictures
in his mind

505
00:51:58.268 --> 00:51:59.771
based on the sounds
that he's hearing.

506
00:51:59.804 --> 00:52:01.505
So he's imagining everything.

507
00:52:01.538 --> 00:52:02.640
Yes. absolutely.

508
00:52:02.674 --> 00:52:03.741
Your head.

509
00:52:03.775 --> 00:52:05.308
Nothing. What do you see?

510
00:52:05.342 --> 00:52:06.811
What's wrong with your head?

511
00:52:06.844 --> 00:52:08.880
There's nothing. Nothing.

512
00:52:08.913 --> 00:52:10.682
Look here. look at this chart?

513
00:52:10.715 --> 00:52:14.284
What? Why are you pointing
a rifle at me?

514
00:52:14.317 --> 00:52:15.853
This is not a rifle.

515
00:52:15.887 --> 00:52:17.755
- Yes. it is!
- No. it's not!

516
00:52:17.789 --> 00:52:20.758
It's a rifle. it's a rifle.

517
00:52:20.792 --> 00:52:22.392
What is happening?

518
00:52:22.426 --> 00:52:24.461
As I told you.
these are all fantasies.

519
00:52:24.494 --> 00:52:27.598
There is a medical term for
this. it's called synesthesia.

520
00:52:27.632 --> 00:52:29.667
People who have this condition.

521
00:52:29.701 --> 00:52:32.235
they see sounds.
they can taste colors.

522
00:52:32.269 --> 00:52:34.237
they can even hear smells.

523
00:52:34.271 --> 00:52:37.340
His mind is compensating
for the loss of sight.

524
00:52:37.374 --> 00:52:41.946
I'm not imagining anything.
It's... it's... it's real.

525
00:52:41.979 --> 00:52:44.849
It's real.

526
00:52:44.882 --> 00:52:48.653
Why have you got a giant cannon
in your office?

527
00:52:54.391 --> 00:52:55.793
What do I do?

528
00:53:18.448 --> 00:53:20.417
Wait. what are you doing?

529
00:53:21.586 --> 00:53:23.386
I'm... I'm going home.

530
00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:26.924
Well. you're blind.
you can't walk alone.

531
00:53:26.958 --> 00:53:29.627
nothing you see is real.

532
00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:34.297
You might mistake a truck
for a giant candy cane!

533
00:53:36.399 --> 00:53:39.637
Or perhaps what I'm seeing
is the real world.

534
00:54:29.452 --> 00:54:30.721
You came back.

535
00:54:38.830 --> 00:54:39.931
Come in.

536
00:54:53.644 --> 00:54:55.112
How are things at home?

537
00:54:57.414 --> 00:54:59.449
Is he still terrorizing you?

538
00:55:03.955 --> 00:55:05.522
He...

539
00:55:08.559 --> 00:55:10.393
He's softened a little.

540
00:55:18.435 --> 00:55:24.775
When he dies. I won't come to
his grave or his funeral.

541
00:55:24.809 --> 00:55:26.077
Please don't say that.

542
00:55:29.881 --> 00:55:31.548
Why?

543
00:55:33.117 --> 00:55:35.620
When I left I had nothing.

544
00:55:35.653 --> 00:55:37.889
I struggled for a long time.

545
00:55:40.057 --> 00:55:41.826
even had to beg.

546
00:55:47.665 --> 00:55:48.900
I brought you something.

547
00:55:59.877 --> 00:56:00.945
A bag?

548
00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:05.082
You still have that bag?

549
00:56:06.584 --> 00:56:07.718
Yes.

550
00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:22.133
How can a self-respecting woman
carry the same bag for 12 years?

551
00:56:23.601 --> 00:56:25.136
It's... it's the only one I have.

552
00:56:26.804 --> 00:56:28.172
I'll buy you a new bag.

553
00:56:30.908 --> 00:56:33.611
You barely have enough money
for yourself.

554
00:56:35.646 --> 00:56:36.881
Whatever money I have.

555
00:56:38.716 --> 00:56:40.550
just so I don't have to see
that thing again.

556
00:56:48.125 --> 00:56:51.929
Do you realize
how many years you've wasted?

557
00:56:54.198 --> 00:56:56.901
Do you realize how many years
you've worn the same shoes.

558
00:56:56.934 --> 00:56:59.036
the same clothes.

559
00:57:02.206 --> 00:57:04.541
This goddamn bag
is just an example.

560
00:57:04.575 --> 00:57:07.745
Who needs a man who doesn't give
a shit about his wife.

561
00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:17.982
I'm sorry.

562
00:58:18.015 --> 00:58:21.218
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

563
00:58:25.389 --> 00:58:26.957
I don't know anymore.

564
00:58:29.727 --> 00:58:32.830
Every night I ask myself
why you are here.

565
00:58:34.198 --> 00:58:35.866
and I blame myself.

566
00:58:46.377 --> 00:58:48.045
It's not easy.

567
00:58:50.014 --> 00:58:52.216
I hate every day that I spend
without you.

568
00:58:53.350 --> 00:58:56.253
I hate every morning
and every night.

569
00:58:56.287 --> 00:58:57.955
I hate my bed.

570
00:58:57.988 --> 00:59:01.058
my food. the thought of waking
up the next day.

571
00:59:10.401 --> 00:59:12.937
I wish...

572
00:59:12.970 --> 00:59:16.807
I wish that you could have felt
how happy I was

573
00:59:16.841 --> 00:59:18.943
when I was making
this food for you.

574
00:59:31.055 --> 00:59:32.790
I'm sorry.

575
00:59:36.093 --> 00:59:39.330
I love you. I love you.

576
00:59:58.182 --> 01:00:00.050
Are you sure you don't need it?

577
01:00:00.084 --> 01:00:01.152
I'm positive.

578
01:00:05.122 --> 01:00:06.757
I see fine.

579
01:00:34.852 --> 01:00:36.353
Oh.

580
01:00:37.354 --> 01:00:39.023
Thank you.

581
01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:51.335
Do you want an apple?

582
01:00:51.368 --> 01:00:53.304
No. I'm not hungry.

583
01:00:57.474 --> 01:00:59.743
Perhaps we should come back
another day.

584
01:01:01.312 --> 01:01:04.481
But why?
When we've got plenty of time.

585
01:01:37.548 --> 01:01:40.784
Don't be afraid to ask for help.
it's why I'm here.

586
01:01:41.385 --> 01:01:43.053
No I won't.

587
01:01:48.425 --> 01:01:49.994
I'm curious.

588
01:01:51.362 --> 01:01:52.997
What about the girl
in the woods?

589
01:01:54.865 --> 01:01:56.300
Have you seen her again?

590
01:01:57.835 --> 01:02:02.206
No. I didn't wanna burden her
with my condition.

591
01:02:03.207 --> 01:02:05.042
She might enjoy making love
to a blind guy.

592
01:02:07.111 --> 01:02:09.413
You may as well make the best
out of a bad situation.

593
01:02:10.547 --> 01:02:12.983
Turn your tragedy into triumph.

594
01:02:17.955 --> 01:02:19.790
Yeah. well.
thanks for the advice.

595
01:02:22.893 --> 01:02:24.295
Uh. by the way...

596
01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:28.432
you know. you and Shakespeare.
you're wrong.

597
01:02:29.266 --> 01:02:30.868
What?

598
01:02:31.302 --> 01:02:33.003
Yeah. we don't die in the end.

599
01:02:34.538 --> 01:02:36.574
No. we live.

600
01:02:37.474 --> 01:02:39.276
How do you know
if you haven't died yet?

601
01:02:40.411 --> 01:02:44.815
Yeah. well. it's because I see.

602
01:02:45.583 --> 01:02:47.151
Oh.

603
01:02:52.122 --> 01:02:53.924
If it makes you feel better.
I agree.

604
01:02:55.593 --> 01:02:58.262
Ah. you think I'm living
in a fairy tale?

605
01:02:59.229 --> 01:03:01.265
I only believe
what my eyes tell me.

606
01:03:01.298 --> 01:03:05.869
No. exactly.
What if your eyes are wrong?

607
01:03:05.903 --> 01:03:09.373
Now what... what if what you see
is just on the surface?

608
01:03:11.542 --> 01:03:13.143
Look around.

609
01:03:14.445 --> 01:03:15.946
And why do you think
these artists

610
01:03:15.979 --> 01:03:17.948
created all of these paintings?

611
01:03:17.981 --> 01:03:20.017
- To be famous.
- No.

612
01:03:21.051 --> 01:03:24.355
No. is to show us
the real world.

613
01:03:26.523 --> 01:03:29.026
See they don't see an apple
with their eyes.

614
01:03:29.059 --> 01:03:31.596
they... they see
what's underneath.

615
01:03:31.629 --> 01:03:33.464
you know. the substance.
the form. the essence.

616
01:03:33.497 --> 01:03:35.299
That's what's eternal.

617
01:03:35.332 --> 01:03:36.967
They were just lucky enough
to see it

618
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.670
when they were still alive.

619
01:03:38.703 --> 01:03:40.638
I don't understand.

620
01:03:52.349 --> 01:03:54.084
The meadow.

621
01:04:02.126 --> 01:04:03.661
Lucky guess.

622
01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:18.008
I...

623
01:04:23.113 --> 01:04:25.449
I know this place.

624
01:06:31.743 --> 01:06:33.243
I can't talk right now.

625
01:06:33.277 --> 01:06:34.646
No. I don't care
how long it's been.

626
01:06:34.679 --> 01:06:36.446
Look... I can't talk.

627
01:07:36.741 --> 01:07:39.509
Hey. come on.

628
01:07:40.745 --> 01:07:42.780
Oh. leave me. I'm... I'm fine.

629
01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:46.751
Let me help you.
I can speak to your husband.

630
01:07:47.417 --> 01:07:48.452
Huh?

631
01:07:51.789 --> 01:07:52.857
Shh...

632
01:07:56.493 --> 01:07:57.795
It's hard to let go.

633
01:08:01.198 --> 01:08:03.166
Sometimes...

634
01:08:05.502 --> 01:08:07.471
sometimes they need to leave.

635
01:08:09.506 --> 01:08:11.743
They need to leave to survive.

636
01:08:15.613 --> 01:08:17.915
To let us survive.

637
01:09:08.733 --> 01:09:09.967
Where have you been?

638
01:09:10.802 --> 01:09:12.502
I was working.

639
01:09:12.536 --> 01:09:14.237
I... didn't think
you worked today.

640
01:09:14.504 --> 01:09:16.440
Yeah. well. I work two jobs now.

641
01:09:18.408 --> 01:09:21.012
Since... since when
did you work two jobs?

642
01:09:21.045 --> 01:09:23.681
Since I need to pay
for your pencils and paper

643
01:09:23.715 --> 01:09:25.449
and for us to eat.

644
01:09:25.482 --> 01:09:27.417
and to pay the bills.

645
01:09:27.451 --> 01:09:29.519
I had no idea. I'm sorry.

646
01:09:34.726 --> 01:09:36.661
You've done a new drawing.

647
01:09:36.694 --> 01:09:37.962
Yeah.

648
01:09:39.964 --> 01:09:41.666
Do you like it?

649
01:09:48.873 --> 01:09:50.842
No. I guess you can't see it
in your world.

650
01:09:50.875 --> 01:09:51.943
My world?

651
01:09:53.410 --> 01:09:55.278
What other world is there?

652
01:09:55.312 --> 01:09:57.715
Look. I know you don't take
what I do seriously.

653
01:09:57.749 --> 01:09:59.584
You... you even tore one of my
drawings.

654
01:09:59.617 --> 01:10:01.418
Yeah. well. maybe I should
have torn it years ago

655
01:10:01.451 --> 01:10:03.020
and then things might be better.

656
01:10:03.054 --> 01:10:05.489
Yeah. but you didn't.

657
01:10:05.522 --> 01:10:08.425
Did you? You didn't.

658
01:10:08.458 --> 01:10:10.027
Which means there must be
a part of you

659
01:10:10.061 --> 01:10:11.863
that still beliefs in what I do.

660
01:10:13.330 --> 01:10:14.866
Oh. come on. am I... am I wrong?

661
01:10:25.342 --> 01:10:26.510
I'll get the door.

662
01:10:35.485 --> 01:10:37.487
- What are you doing here?
- I've tried to call many times.

663
01:10:37.521 --> 01:10:38.689
but you're refusing
to speak to me.

664
01:10:38.723 --> 01:10:40.024
Keep your voice down.

665
01:10:40.057 --> 01:10:41.626
I told you this
is not a good time.

666
01:10:41.659 --> 01:10:43.527
- Where is he?
- He's in the living room.

667
01:10:43.561 --> 01:10:45.096
He's blind. he cannot see us.

668
01:10:45.129 --> 01:10:46.530
You need to leave.

669
01:10:46.564 --> 01:10:48.566
No. Not until you talk to me.

670
01:10:48.966 --> 01:10:50.333
Okay. Wait.

671
01:10:57.942 --> 01:10:59.376
Who was it?

672
01:11:00.711 --> 01:11:01.946
It was our neighbor.

673
01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:04.447
She has a problem
with her televisions.

674
01:11:05.783 --> 01:11:08.686
Um. would you be okay for a
minute if I go help her?

675
01:11:09.419 --> 01:11:11.923
Yeah. Yeah. of course.
Yeah. go ahead.

676
01:11:12.857 --> 01:11:14.058
Okay.

677
01:11:40.685 --> 01:11:42.019
What do you want to talk about?

678
01:11:42.053 --> 01:11:44.454
He's blind.
I wanna take care of you.

679
01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:47.390
I don't need others
to take care of me.

680
01:11:47.424 --> 01:11:49.126
So what am I. an other?

681
01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:50.828
I love you. Can't you see?

682
01:11:50.862 --> 01:11:51.996
- Come to me.
- Stop.

683
01:11:52.029 --> 01:11:53.463
- Why?
- Stop.

684
01:11:53.496 --> 01:11:54.464
Because I can't keep lying
to him.

685
01:11:54.497 --> 01:11:56.667
- Ah...
- What?

686
01:11:56.701 --> 01:11:59.837
I started this with you
because I hated him.

687
01:11:59.871 --> 01:12:01.839
I hated my marriage.

688
01:12:01.873 --> 01:12:03.841
But it's different now.

689
01:12:03.875 --> 01:12:05.676
I feel badly for him.

690
01:12:06.543 --> 01:12:08.079
I pity him.

691
01:12:38.976 --> 01:12:40.443
I should have told him
years ago.

692
01:12:40.477 --> 01:12:42.079
- Let me hug you.
- Oh. stop.

693
01:12:42.113 --> 01:12:45.783
Stop. Stop. he could come in.

694
01:12:45.816 --> 01:12:47.852
What will he see?

695
01:12:47.885 --> 01:12:49.854
I don't know. but he's seeing
things. he does see things.

696
01:12:49.887 --> 01:12:53.557
Just relax. You need to cope.

697
01:12:54.558 --> 01:12:55.793
It's what you've always wanted.

698
01:12:55.826 --> 01:12:57.194
It's what he cannot give you.

699
01:12:57.995 --> 01:12:59.462
I can't do this.

700
01:12:59.697 --> 01:13:00.932
I can't do it.

701
01:13:01.599 --> 01:13:03.500
You've been doing this
a long time.

702
01:13:03.533 --> 01:13:04.835
He doesn't love you.

703
01:14:20.945 --> 01:14:22.512
What's going on?

704
01:14:27.585 --> 01:14:28.853
Who's in here?

705
01:14:31.922 --> 01:14:33.657
Who's in here?

706
01:14:33.691 --> 01:14:34.925
Stop it.

707
01:14:34.959 --> 01:14:36.927
- Who's in here with you?
- No one. no one.

708
01:14:36.961 --> 01:14:38.095
- Who is that?
- No one!

709
01:14:38.129 --> 01:14:40.097
Tell me who you are.

710
01:14:40.131 --> 01:14:42.166
Who are you?

711
01:14:42.199 --> 01:14:43.267
Who are you?

712
01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:44.702
There's nobody.

713
01:14:44.735 --> 01:14:45.903
- Tell me who you are.
- Stop!

714
01:14:45.936 --> 01:14:47.138
Where are you?

715
01:14:58.849 --> 01:15:00.550
Shame on you.

716
01:15:01.352 --> 01:15:03.721
Were you going to wait
until I went blind?

717
01:15:05.756 --> 01:15:07.992
Call my friend and tell him to
get me out of here.

718
01:15:09.326 --> 01:15:10.661
- Call him!
- Okay.

719
01:15:22.373 --> 01:15:24.075
I came as soon as I could.

720
01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:30.815
Watch your head.

721
01:16:09.887 --> 01:16:11.989
Maybe we should go back
to mine just for a little bit.

722
01:16:12.022 --> 01:16:13.157
We'll think of something.

723
01:16:13.190 --> 01:16:14.992
Just drive. all right?

724
01:16:15.025 --> 01:16:16.894
Please just... just keep driving.

725
01:16:25.202 --> 01:16:27.671
You know. you're the only person
who understands me.

726
01:16:36.313 --> 01:16:39.116
At the end of the day. she...
she wasn't happy.

727
01:16:40.217 --> 01:16:41.919
I don't blame her.

728
01:16:43.154 --> 01:16:45.956
I just wish she had someone.

729
01:16:45.990 --> 01:16:48.192
You know. I wish she had someone
to go back to.

730
01:16:48.993 --> 01:16:51.095
and then that will make me
both the happiest

731
01:16:51.128 --> 01:16:54.165
and saddest person in the world.

732
01:16:58.469 --> 01:17:03.407
God. I don't know what to think.

733
01:17:08.045 --> 01:17:10.381
This will make you think.

734
01:17:11.448 --> 01:17:13.083
Why. what's that?

735
01:17:13.117 --> 01:17:14.218
Now we'll both see people
in peculiar ways.

736
01:17:17.454 --> 01:17:20.024
Yeah. Well. I haven't lost my
sense of smell. that's for sure.

737
01:17:20.057 --> 01:17:22.259
Do you want one then?

738
01:17:22.293 --> 01:17:24.261
No. no. I'm all right.

739
01:17:24.295 --> 01:17:26.830
Of course you don't. You're
already high. aren't you?

740
01:17:26.864 --> 01:17:29.033
Crazy man.

741
01:17:41.545 --> 01:17:43.180
What do I look like now?

742
01:17:43.214 --> 01:17:44.448
You what?

743
01:17:44.481 --> 01:17:46.417
I said. what do I look like now?

744
01:17:48.786 --> 01:17:50.454
I can see your body. but...

745
01:17:53.791 --> 01:17:55.226
I can't see your face.

746
01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:58.762
You can't see me face? Perfect.

747
01:18:01.465 --> 01:18:03.367
Have you got a cigarette?

748
01:18:04.835 --> 01:18:05.936
Come on. give us a cigarette.

749
01:18:05.970 --> 01:18:07.204
I'll give you one.

750
01:18:07.238 --> 01:18:08.405
Here.

751
01:18:19.483 --> 01:18:22.086
Nothing. nothing. I just...

752
01:18:22.119 --> 01:18:24.288
just burned myself.

753
01:18:41.905 --> 01:18:43.073
Turn around.

754
01:18:43.107 --> 01:18:44.475
Why?

755
01:18:44.508 --> 01:18:46.510
Just turn around.

756
01:18:46.543 --> 01:18:48.045
I know where I need to go.

757
01:18:48.078 --> 01:18:49.280
Just... just take me there.

758
01:18:49.313 --> 01:18:50.948
Where is there?

759
01:18:50.981 --> 01:18:53.183
The place you took me before.
you remember?

760
01:18:53.217 --> 01:18:54.285
The forest?

761
01:18:54.318 --> 01:18:58.222
Yeah. Yeah. the forest.

762
01:19:25.449 --> 01:19:26.950
Is everything all right?

763
01:19:33.591 --> 01:19:35.926
I came to ask you a favor.

764
01:19:47.404 --> 01:19:49.340
I need to move my belongings.

765
01:19:51.308 --> 01:19:55.479
My husband now... I can't stay
another night in our apartment.

766
01:19:56.347 --> 01:19:57.414
Sit.

767
01:20:00.050 --> 01:20:02.286
Of course. you can bring
your things to my place.

768
01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:04.988
Thank you.

769
01:20:11.563 --> 01:20:15.966
As you can see. I'm...
I'm moving.

770
01:20:19.937 --> 01:20:22.574
I'm relocating
back to the States.

771
01:20:26.043 --> 01:20:29.380
Don't worry. I...
I have plenty of colleagues

772
01:20:29.413 --> 01:20:35.085
that I can recommend
your serv... service.

773
01:20:36.153 --> 01:20:38.389
Thank you. That's very generous.

774
01:20:45.496 --> 01:20:47.531
If you prefer.

775
01:20:53.103 --> 01:20:56.073
You can come and work.

776
01:20:58.075 --> 01:20:59.543
be...

777
01:21:02.413 --> 01:21:04.381
work with me in the States.

778
01:21:17.662 --> 01:21:19.731
This is it. Are we here?

779
01:21:19.764 --> 01:21:21.031
Yeah.

780
01:21:25.603 --> 01:21:27.037
Want some help?

781
01:21:27.070 --> 01:21:28.138
No. no. I've got it.

782
01:21:28.172 --> 01:21:29.506
You've got it.

783
01:22:10.481 --> 01:22:12.983
Look. I know
this may be hard for you.

784
01:22:14.485 --> 01:22:18.590
But when you leave her.
and I know that you will.

785
01:22:24.662 --> 01:22:28.465
you don't throw her away.
you be kind to her.

786
01:22:30.067 --> 01:22:31.301
Please.

787
01:22:33.771 --> 01:22:35.439
For me.

788
01:23:13.745 --> 01:23:15.680
Who is this?

789
01:23:15.713 --> 01:23:17.514
I offered you a drink.

790
01:23:18.583 --> 01:23:19.717
Do you remember?

791
01:23:20.785 --> 01:23:22.319
Yes. I do.

792
01:23:24.689 --> 01:23:26.591
Well. why can't I see you?

793
01:23:26.624 --> 01:23:28.492
You're blind.

794
01:23:28.525 --> 01:23:30.828
But I... I see everyone.

795
01:23:30.862 --> 01:23:33.363
And... and I can't see you.

796
01:23:33.397 --> 01:23:36.568
And I... I feel everything and
I... I can't feel you.

797
01:23:36.601 --> 01:23:39.536
Yes. I know. I know.

798
01:23:41.305 --> 01:23:43.675
Come. let me lead you
where you're going.

799
01:23:51.148 --> 01:23:54.251
When you stare at your
reflection in the mirror.

800
01:23:56.353 --> 01:23:57.789
you feel scared.

801
01:23:58.923 --> 01:24:02.125
When you look that image
in the eye.

802
01:24:02.159 --> 01:24:05.730
you'll feel that you're alone.
but you're never alone.

803
01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:10.400
Who else is there?

804
01:24:11.836 --> 01:24:13.705
Some other you.

805
01:24:24.616 --> 01:24:25.783
Go ahead.

806
01:24:28.285 --> 01:24:31.388
you don't even need me anymore.

807
01:24:31.421 --> 01:24:33.457
Go ahead.

808
01:25:44.929 --> 01:25:46.964
Hello.

809
01:25:46.998 --> 01:25:48.365
My guest.

810
01:25:53.871 --> 01:25:55.338
Can I come in?

811
01:25:56.373 --> 01:25:57.942
Of course.

812
01:26:12.389 --> 01:26:13.858
A glass of cold water?

813
01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:18.361
Um. yeah. Please. yes.

814
01:26:31.676 --> 01:26:33.911
Shit.

815
01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:37.547
- What happened?
- I'm so sorry.

816
01:26:37.582 --> 01:26:39.483
I hope I didn't break anything.
I don't know what happened.

817
01:26:39.516 --> 01:26:41.719
- How did you fall?
- I don't know. really.

818
01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:43.988
I'm fine.

819
01:26:47.491 --> 01:26:48.960
I'm so sorry.

820
01:27:41.411 --> 01:27:43.313
I'm blind.

821
01:27:46.117 --> 01:27:48.518
I've... I've gone blind.

822
01:27:57.662 --> 01:27:59.130
I should be probably going.

823
01:27:59.163 --> 01:28:00.631
No. no stay.

824
01:28:02.399 --> 01:28:04.969
Easy. Stay.

825
01:28:11.809 --> 01:28:13.678
I've been waiting for you.

826
01:28:14.979 --> 01:28:17.782
Why didn't you tell me?

827
01:28:20.818 --> 01:28:21.919
I was scared.

828
01:28:24.155 --> 01:28:26.624
You know. I was scared I...
I wouldn't see you again.

829
01:28:28.192 --> 01:28:29.927
but I see you.

830
01:28:32.897 --> 01:28:34.732
I see you.

831
01:28:36.466 --> 01:28:37.969
What...

832
01:28:42.106 --> 01:28:43.875
what exactly do you see?

833
01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:53.784
I see everything.

834
01:28:58.055 --> 01:28:59.991
Everything.

835
01:29:26.050 --> 01:29:28.019
This is all I want to take.

836
01:29:28.052 --> 01:29:29.921
The driver will take that down.

837
01:29:41.565 --> 01:29:42.767
My husband drew that.

838
01:29:45.803 --> 01:29:47.138
He's blind.

839
01:29:48.538 --> 01:29:50.107
I don't know what it means.

840
01:29:55.146 --> 01:29:56.847
It's where we're going.

841
01:30:20.705 --> 01:30:22.106
Hello.

842
01:30:24.041 --> 01:30:25.576
Hello.

843
01:30:29.146 --> 01:30:31.015
What's your name?

844
01:30:33.550 --> 01:30:38.122
I'm the blind man. and you?

845
01:30:45.763 --> 01:30:48.165
I'm nobody.

846
01:33:58.389 --> 01:33:59.723
Hello. Father.
