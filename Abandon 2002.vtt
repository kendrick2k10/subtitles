and I feel better
for a second.

like I'm somebody
with someplace to go.

11
00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:16.030

I'm a complete fraud

12
00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.150

right through me.

to be declared dead.

that he's forcing
upon the college.

141
00:07:43.149 --> 00:07:45.069

we don't use force.

142

Not in the People's Republic.
we ask politely.

143
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.159
Because the college is good
for the tax base.

for the community

about the privacy
of its students.

156
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.040
Oh. I understand. Doctor.
I'll be gentle.

157
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.209

158
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.180
He disappeared.

159
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:27.189

Haven't heard from him.

164
00:08:35.009 --> 00:08:35.210
Not once?

165
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.049
Not even once.

166
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:38.190
Do you have any idea
where he might be?

167
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:39.179
No.

168
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.129

that the finish line
is right there

just get across it.
then everything will be okay.

538
00:33:42.049 --> 00:33:44.069
Come on. how long has it been.
sophomore year?

539
00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:47.230
What if it's rusty or broken?

540
00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:52.039
I still feel like
I'm betraying him.

541
00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:54.039
Embry? Please.

542
00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:57.079
What if Embry comes back?

543
00:33:57.099 --> 00:34:01.019
He'd wreck your life
just like before.

544
00:34:05.109 --> 00:34:07.039
WADE: Listen.
I want to tell you something.

545
00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:10.159
I believe your
friend Embry is dead.

546
00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:15.230
He had two airline tickets
for Athens. Greece.

547
00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:17.199
Never used.
No credit activity.

548
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.099
He didn't believe in credit.

549
00:34:20.119 --> 00:34:22.099
No cash withdrawals. No ATM.

550
00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:26.019
Was that other ticket for you?

551
00:34:26.039 --> 00:34:27.130
Were you going to Athens?

552
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.059
Originally. but we were
both having second thoughts.

553
00:34:33.079 --> 00:34:35.110
Well. I saw
the beginning of that show.

554
00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:36.219
His speech to the audience.

555
00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:40.150
Look. that was just
Embry being Embry.

556
00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:42.230
He was going for shock value.

557
00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:45.070
He was leaving.
I was a sophomore.

558
00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:46.179
I mean. I thought
that he would call from Europe

559
00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:49.059
and maybe I would meet up
with him in the summer.

560
00:34:52.059 --> 00:34:53.150
I never heard from him.

561
00:34:58.070 --> 00:35:00.050
You have unusually kind eyes.

562
00:35:04.099 --> 00:35:06.000
See you around. Detective.

563
00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:13.150
I'm Wade Handler. I'm a cop.

564
00:35:19.099 --> 00:35:20.170
Oh.

565
00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:22.190
You don't have to share
if you don't want to.

566
00:35:24.179 --> 00:35:26.059
I don't even know what to say.

567
00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:32.139
I'd find tollbooth tickets
and credit card receipts

568
00:35:32.159 --> 00:35:34.119
for bars in towns
I didn't think I'd been to.

569
00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:39.139
One day I went out to my car.

570
00:35:39.159 --> 00:35:41.130
and there's
a dent in the front.

571
00:35:43.179 --> 00:35:45.039
I look closer.

572
00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:50.070
There's blood
and some brown hair.

573
00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:56.050
I still don't know
what happened.

574
00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:00.039
Maybe it was a cat.

575
00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:04.230
WADE: There was
an incident two years ago

576
00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:07.210
involving an undergraduate
student and illegal drugs.

577
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:10.019
Right.
What do you want to know
about Embry Larkin?

578
00:36:10.039 --> 00:36:11.079
Well. he got himself arrested.

579
00:36:11.099 --> 00:36:13.010
I want to know
what he was selling.
Was it heroin?

580
00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:16.070
Heroin? Embry?

581
00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:18.070
-Are you kidding?
-I'm not kidding.

582
00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:21.039
No. no.
he wasn't into that shit.

583
00:36:21.059 --> 00:36:22.219
They put him on
Ritalin when he was three.

584
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.110
You know. your
standard ADD misdiagnosis.

585
00:36:28.099 --> 00:36:29.059
Okay. um...

586
00:36:33.039 --> 00:36:35.110
Basically.
he was taking Wellbutrin

587
00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:38.230
which is sort of like having
a perfect cup of coffee.

588
00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:40.199
You know.
it was great for work.
great for repetitive tasks.

589
00:36:40.219 --> 00:36:41.230
Add in some Paxil

590
00:36:42.010 --> 00:36:44.139
which is anti-depression.
anti-anxiety.

591
00:36:44.159 --> 00:36:46.119
That general
sense of well-being.

592
00:36:46.139 --> 00:36:47.230
Was he selling it?

593
00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:50.210
Look. Embry's dad was rich
and Embry's mom was rich

594
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.070
and they died when
he was three or four
making him doubly rich. so no.

595
00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:56.079
So. what'd it do?

596
00:36:56.099 --> 00:36:59.110
Made him normal.
you know. when he took it.

"Katie. Katie."

605
00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:46.219
There was somebody
on the other side

of the row of books.

607
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.159
I think it was
my old boyfriend.
I think he's back.

608
00:40:51.179 --> 00:40:54.090
I'm almost certain
I saw him in his car.

609
00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:56.130
I think he's been watching me.

610
00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:58.170
And how did
that make you feel?

611
00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:59.150
Nervous.

I want to see him. but...

615
00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:12.099
But I'm scared that
I want to see him.

616
00:41:12.119 --> 00:41:14.010
Why do you say scared?

617
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:16.059
Because I lost
a part of myself with him.

618
00:41:17.019 --> 00:41:19.000
I just dissolved.

619
00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:24.019
He was like a drug.

620
00:41:24.039 --> 00:41:26.099
And he was locked
inside the library with you?

621
00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:30.139
I think so. yes.

622
00:41:30.159 --> 00:41:32.059
But you hadn't
seen him in two years?

623
00:41:32.079 --> 00:41:34.159
I know how this sounds.

624
00:41:34.179 --> 00:41:36.139
Katie. you fell
asleep in an old library

625
00:41:36.159 --> 00:41:39.070
which is terrifying under
the best of circumstances.

she could be an artist.

in a houseboat in Amsterdam.

a sailboat off
the coast of Sardinia.

634
00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:08.030
He'd compose. she'd sing
and tell him he was a genius.

635

Please.
I'll have a double order
of escape fantasy

and a side of running away.

637
00:42:12.079 --> 00:42:13.150
He was losing interest?

638
00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:14.219
I saw it coming.

639
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.190
He'd replaced her in his show.

That bastard hurt her.

641
00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:21.170
You know. she hasn't
dated anyone in two years.

642
00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:23.190
Was he a jealous guy?

643
00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:27.099
He didn't like her friends.
particularly the guy friends.

644
00:42:27.119 --> 00:42:31.170
Particularly. one friend.
This guy. Harrison Hobart.

645
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:33.030
He felt threatened by me.

646
00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:36.050
Katie and I are close.

647
00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:39.050
and one day he was being
a bit of a bully
psychologically

648
00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:41.079
and I said something.

649
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.110
He turned on me.

650
00:42:44.179 --> 00:42:47.099
He just started poking me
in the chest with his...

651
00:42:47.119 --> 00:42:49.139
With his finger until.
finally. I stopped backing up.

652
00:42:51.039 --> 00:42:53.119
You know. I didn't realize
he had a bottle in his hand.

653
00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:56.039
He put you in the hospital.

654
00:42:57.210 --> 00:43:00.179
Yeah. well.
it was only overnight.

655
00:43:00.199 --> 00:43:02.179
Why didn't you press charges?

656
00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:05.079
If you had pressed charges.

657
00:43:05.099 --> 00:43:07.039
Katie might've
held it against you?

658
00:43:09.099 --> 00:43:11.190
Yeah. probably.

659
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.079
You see.

660
00:43:16.099 --> 00:43:18.099
Embry didn't want to admit it.

661
00:43:18.119 --> 00:43:20.119
but Katie and I have
much more in common

662
00:43:20.139 --> 00:43:22.059
than the two of them did.

663
00:43:22.079 --> 00:43:23.210

Well. either you are
or you're not. Right?

Well. I got a pocketful
of Get-Out-Of-Jail-Free cards

717
00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:28.070
and I never changed anything.

718

To not think that every time
the phone rang it was you!

787

To not think that
every piece of mail

788

about somebody
being in the tunnel?

supposed to be open

to Harry Hobart

01:01:08.059 --> 01:01:11.079
He got his name
on scientific papers
when he was about 12.

895
01:01:11.099 --> 01:01:14.179
So. what did he
know about anything?

896

Do you think it was odd
that he still liked a girl

who hadn't shown him any real
interest in over two years?

the opposite of odd.

You might want to ask yourself
why you're so
interested in her.

905

They think it's
a coltish vulnerability.

"She needs saving."

"I can save her."

doesn't notice them.
