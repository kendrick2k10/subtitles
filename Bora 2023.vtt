I told you I'm a law abiding citizen.

185
00:11:01.238 --> 00:11:03.390
And I'm not Black. I'm Cuban.

186
00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.307
I'm just Black passing.

187
00:11:09.195 --> 00:11:10.028
Okay.

188
00:11:11.143 --> 00:11:14.898
You know what. I'm not
even gonna touch that shit.

189
00:11:14.898 --> 00:11:16.842
I'm gonna let you do you.

190
00:11:16.842 --> 00:11:19.322
Thank you for the ride. though.

191
00:11:19.322 --> 00:11:21.486
I appreciate it.

192
00:11:21.486 --> 00:11:25.319
Um. I usually don't
allow smoking in my car.

193
00:11:26.466 --> 00:11:27.299
So...

194
00:11:29.894 --> 00:11:31.127
Okay. so are you gonna pull over

195
00:11:31.127 --> 00:11:35.366
or we just gonna look
at each other all day?

196
00:11:35.366 --> 00:11:38.283
I mean. I'm cool either way. but...

197
00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:41.643
Okay.

198
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:08.894
Is that pot or some kind of narcotic?

199
00:12:10.578 --> 00:12:11.411
Pot?

200
00:12:12.665 --> 00:12:13.915

00:12:17.654 --> 00:12:20.487

239
00:14:38.409 --> 00:14:40.637

Are you gonna smoke with me or what?

250
00:15:19.452 --> 00:15:20.285
Whatever.

251
00:15:22.348 --> 00:15:24.765
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

252
00:15:25.928 --> 00:15:28.761
I have never really smoked before.

253
00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.754
I could teach you.

254
00:15:32.754 --> 00:15:34.921

I don't want the police to pull up on us.

Ain't nobody gonna fuckin' lock you up

258
00:15:42.368 --> 00:15:46.076
for smoking pot in fucking
Southern California.

259
00:15:46.076 --> 00:15:47.844
Let me teach you.

260
00:15:47.844 --> 00:15:51.600
All you gotta do is hold it like this.

261
00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:56.433
Put your thumb over that and
inhale when I light the fire.

262
00:16:06.597 --> 00:16:11.430
You about to be fucked up.

263
00:17:53.641 --> 00:17:55.224
- Wow.
- I'm sorry.

264
00:17:56.081 --> 00:17:59.068
I'm getting you wet and I
didn't even ask your name.

265
00:17:59.068 --> 00:18:00.485
It's. uh. Elon.

266
00:18:03.197 --> 00:18:05.935
Elon?

267
00:18:05.935 --> 00:18:07.185

268
00:18:08.093 --> 00:18:11.424
Damn bitch. you were raised
by white people. huh?

269
00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:14.231

270
00:18:14.231 --> 00:18:15.251
Funny.

271
00:18:16.443 --> 00:18:18.419
And what should I call you?

272
00:18:18.419 --> 00:18:19.804
Stony hitchhiker?

273
00:18:19.804 --> 00:18:24.559
Mm. you could call me that
or you could call me Bora.

274
00:18:24.559 --> 00:18:26.747
And don't you forget that shit

275
00:18:26.747 --> 00:18:31.747
because I'm only gonna
tell you one time.

276
00:18:32.052 --> 00:18:33.379
Hey!

277
00:18:33.379 --> 00:18:36.583
What are your Black bitches
doing swimming to my pool?

278
00:18:43.095 --> 00:18:44.717
What the fuck did you just call us?

279
00:18:44.717 --> 00:18:46.913
You're trespassing on private property.

280
00:18:46.913 --> 00:18:50.553
You're lucky I don't call the police.

281
00:18:50.553 --> 00:18:51.636
The police?

282
00:18:52.487 --> 00:18:54.425
Are you serious?

283
00:18:54.425 --> 00:18:58.761
Sir. we're just young girls
trying to enjoy our summer.

284
00:18:58.761 --> 00:19:03.068
You were young once. right?

285
00:19:03.068 --> 00:19:04.211
If I'd known it was gonna be like this.

286
00:19:04.211 --> 00:19:06.484
I would've had your friend stay.

287
00:19:15.023 --> 00:19:18.374
I can't believe the guy
didn't call the cops on us.

288
00:19:18.374 --> 00:19:21.775
Yeah. I gave him a fake
number and he let us go.

289
00:19:29.601 --> 00:19:31.322
Aye. you know what we should do?

290
00:19:31.322 --> 00:19:35.607
You should let me show you
LA before we go to Monterey.

291
00:19:35.607 --> 00:19:37.027
But I live here.

292
00:19:37.027 --> 00:19:39.933
Yeah. but I can tell
you don't get out much.

293
00:19:39.933 --> 00:19:42.643
And besides my daddy was a straight cholo.

So I can show us the
best of both worlds. ma.

Okay. I guess that can be cool.

You need anything out of here?

297
00:20:13.496 --> 00:20:15.344
Maybe some waters.

00:23:11.186 --> 00:23:13.118
Yo. nigga. that's that bullshit.

00:23:19.666 --> 00:23:20.922
Yeah. I'ma need that pistol back. too.

00:23:20.922 --> 00:23:22.714
This bat ain't doin' shit.

368
00:23:22.714 --> 00:23:24.206
And call the po-po.

369
00:23:24.206 --> 00:23:25.413
Hey!

370
00:23:25.413 --> 00:23:28.496
You better not tell her.

371
00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:32.263
Thanks.

372
00:23:35.064 --> 00:23:36.619
No way.

373
00:23:37.603 --> 00:23:39.151
What?

374
00:23:39.151 --> 00:23:40.712
What's up?

375
00:23:40.712 --> 00:23:42.295
- Hey.
- What it do?

376
00:23:43.847 --> 00:23:45.995
You wanna cruise with us?

377
00:23:45.995 --> 00:23:46.828
Um...

378
00:23:47.747 --> 00:23:49.627
No. it's okay.

379
00:23:49.627 --> 00:23:50.751
Why not?

380
00:23:50.751 --> 00:23:52.448
- Your car's cool. though.
- Yeah?

381
00:23:52.448 --> 00:23:54.335
You said you were
gonna let me show you LA.

382
00:23:54.335 --> 00:23:55.168
Yeah.

383
00:23:57.031 --> 00:23:57.864
Come on.

384
00:23:57.864 --> 00:24:00.128
For all we know. they
robbed the liquor store.

385
00:24:00.128 --> 00:24:01.350
Say who?

386
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:03.483
They would never do something like that.

387
00:24:03.483 --> 00:24:05.611
Those waters are free.

388
00:24:05.611 --> 00:24:06.639
Come on.

389
00:24:06.639 --> 00:24:07.618
At least let me. you know.

390
00:24:07.618 --> 00:24:09.796
cruise with you. show you around.

391
00:24:09.796 --> 00:24:11.500
Let me show you what's up.

392
00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:13.504
Where you gotta be?

393
00:24:13.504 --> 00:24:14.372
Where you gotta be?

394
00:24:14.372 --> 00:24:16.783
Mm-hm. where? With us.

I wish you would've told me
about 'em earlier. though.

440
00:26:25.383 --> 00:26:27.133
Why you so quiet. ma?

441
00:26:27.988 --> 00:26:30.684
Ah. come on. This is the fuckin' life.

442
00:26:30.684 --> 00:26:32.351
Look at that sunset.

443
00:26:35.656 --> 00:26:40.489
It's like everything just
feels super intense right now.

444
00:26:42.592 --> 00:26:46.418
It's like. like the road is
a treadmill or something.

445
00:26:46.418 --> 00:26:50.835
We're going really fast but
we're not going anywhere.

446
00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:57.739
That's a combination
of this strong ass kush

447
00:26:57.739 --> 00:27:02.195
we just smoked and freedom.

448
00:27:02.195 --> 00:27:04.366
You're free. bitch.

449
00:27:04.366 --> 00:27:07.635
Free to say what you
want. do what you want.

450
00:27:07.635 --> 00:27:09.468
Fuck whoever you want.

451
00:27:10.446 --> 00:27:12.120
In fucking public. if you want to.

452
00:27:13.644 --> 00:27:17.273
I don't know about the
fucking whoever you want part.

453
00:27:17.273 --> 00:27:18.856
Ah. let me guess.

454
00:27:20.452 --> 00:27:22.119
You got a boyfriend?

455
00:27:23.136 --> 00:27:25.840
And I'm guessing you don't?

456
00:27:26.924 --> 00:27:29.853
Why the fuck would I wanna do that?

457
00:27:29.853 --> 00:27:31.576
Why the fuck would any
logical thinking woman

458
00:27:31.576 --> 00:27:32.576
wanna do it?

459
00:27:33.436 --> 00:27:34.436
A boyfriend?

460
00:27:35.516 --> 00:27:38.696
And what the fuck does
that shit even mean anyway?

461
00:27:38.696 --> 00:27:40.828
He's a boy. which means he's not a man.

462
00:27:40.828 --> 00:27:42.822
which means he has no idea what the fuck

463
00:27:42.822 --> 00:27:46.792
he wants to do with his life
other than control his bitch.

464
00:27:46.792 --> 00:27:50.468
which in this case will be you. Elon.

465
00:27:50.468 --> 00:27:52.575
And don't let him be under 40 years old.

466
00:27:52.575 --> 00:27:55.091
'cause that means his credit is fucked up.

467
00:27:55.091 --> 00:27:56.884
Which means that you're the only thing

468
00:27:56.884 --> 00:27:58.634
he can afford to own.

469
00:27:59.939 --> 00:28:03.710
And if he's just a friend.
like the name implies.

470
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:08.316
that means he can walk
outta your life at any time.

471
00:28:08.316 --> 00:28:11.149
The man gets to lie. cheat. steal.

472
00:28:12.208 --> 00:28:14.657
collect women like trophies.

473
00:28:14.657 --> 00:28:18.050
And society always takes
him back. you know why?

474
00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:19.633
Because he's a man.

475
00:28:20.957 --> 00:28:24.966
So why should I gift my
beautiful. golden pussy

476
00:28:24.966 --> 00:28:27.849
to just one. and for free?

477
00:28:27.849 --> 00:28:29.785
Fuck that shit.

478
00:28:29.785 --> 00:28:31.702
Pussy rules everything.

479
00:28:34.345 --> 00:28:36.704
You know it. I know it.

480
00:28:36.704 --> 00:28:38.537
They all know it. too.

481
00:28:39.854 --> 00:28:42.225
Hey. I play the game.

482
00:28:42.225 --> 00:28:43.225
I play nice.

483
00:28:44.509 --> 00:28:49.426
But at the end of the day. you
know what I really wanna do?

484
00:28:50.679 --> 00:28:55.128
Every time a motherfucker
asks me to make him dinner.

485
00:28:55.128 --> 00:28:59.037
I wanna cut off his dick
and I wanna chop it up

486
00:28:59.037 --> 00:29:02.181
into a thousand little pieces.

487
00:29:02.181 --> 00:29:05.813
Then I wanna sprinkle it in a soup.

488
00:29:05.813 --> 00:29:08.146
Then I wanna feed it to him.

489
00:29:10.637 --> 00:29:14.137
just before I put on my red bottoms.

490
00:29:14.137 --> 00:29:16.804
walk over to him real slow-like.

491
00:29:18.361 --> 00:29:21.512
and kick him where I used to be.

492
00:29:21.512 --> 00:29:23.806
And if I'm feeling merciful.
I pull out my pistol

493
00:29:23.806 --> 00:29:28.806
and put him out of his misery.

494
00:29:29.332 --> 00:29:33.107
Ah. come on.

495
00:29:33.107 --> 00:29:34.107
I'm kidding.

496
00:29:35.867 --> 00:29:39.461
Dang. girl.

497
00:29:39.461 --> 00:29:43.075
It sounds like you've been through a lot.

498
00:29:43.075 --> 00:29:46.207
But my man's one of the good ones.

499
00:29:46.207 --> 00:29:48.556
You just gotta ask God to heal your heart

500
00:29:48.556 --> 00:29:51.947
and make room for your soulmate.

501
00:29:51.947 --> 00:29:55.247
There's gotta be someone
out there for you.

502
00:29:55.247 --> 00:29:57.831
There are no good ones. bitch.

503
00:29:59.773 --> 00:30:03.171
They're just getting better at
lying 'cause of the internet.

504
00:30:03.171 --> 00:30:06.454
The information is
traveling faster. that's it.

505
00:30:06.454 --> 00:30:07.371
But even if that's the case.

506
00:30:07.371 --> 00:30:11.548
joking about chopping
someone's dick off is a lot.

507
00:30:11.548 --> 00:30:13.131
Why not just leave?

508
00:30:15.806 --> 00:30:20.306
If we just leave. how they
gonna learn their lesson?

509
00:30:23.795 --> 00:30:28.128
They don't give us respect.
we gotta take that shit.

510
00:30:31.623 --> 00:30:33.021
Good ones?

511
00:30:33.021 --> 00:30:34.688
You're funny. bitch.

512
00:30:57.899 --> 00:30:59.709
I hope you
don't wait until the last minute

513
00:30:59.709 --> 00:31:01.981
to get your costume. 'cause LA is about

514
00:31:01.981 --> 00:31:04.534
to be lit this Halloween weekend.

515
00:31:04.534 --> 00:31:06.119
I'm kind of glad we're stopping

516
00:31:06.119 --> 00:31:07.032
'cause I really need to sober up

517
00:31:07.032 --> 00:31:09.403
before we get back on the road.

518
00:31:09.403 --> 00:31:11.091
Do you believe in God. Elon?

519
00:31:11.091 --> 00:31:13.040
Of course. why?

520
00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:14.323
Then pray and ask him to get us

521
00:31:14.323 --> 00:31:17.190
into this motherfuckin' party. bitch.

522
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:18.023
Bora.

523
00:31:18.023 --> 00:31:18.856
What's up. family?

524
00:31:18.856 --> 00:31:19.802
- What's good. my guy?
- Big respect.

525
00:31:19.802 --> 00:31:20.733
Knock out artist.

526
00:31:20.733 --> 00:31:21.566
Appreciate it. appreciate it.

527
00:31:21.566 --> 00:31:22.918
I got me and my wife.
Y'all good.

528
00:31:22.918 --> 00:31:24.649
All right. Oh yeah. by the way.

529
00:31:24.649 --> 00:31:26.460
Who you got? Spence or Pacquiao?

530
00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:27.646
Spence. all day. homie.

531
00:31:27.646 --> 00:31:28.479
Oh. yeah. yeah. yeah.

532
00:31:28.479 --> 00:31:29.638
All day. homie.

533
00:31:29.638 --> 00:31:30.560
- You gotta-
- Listen.

534
00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:31.393

between that and you speeding in my car.

714
00:40:26.623 --> 00:40:31.623
Well. if I'm speeding and
there's nobody here to see it.

715
00:40:31.819 --> 00:40:33.986
then am I really speeding?

716
00:40:38.803 --> 00:40:41.643
See. I told you you were speeding.

717
00:40:41.643 --> 00:40:43.199
If we get a ticket. you're paying for it.

718
00:40:43.199 --> 00:40:44.210
Hey. relax.

719
00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:45.949
You're a law abiding citizen. remember?

720
00:40:48.426 --> 00:40:49.426
Pull over.

721
00:41:09.811 --> 00:41:12.399
License and registration.

722
00:41:12.399 --> 00:41:13.651
Why are you asking for her license

723
00:41:13.651 --> 00:41:15.181
when I'm the one driving?

724
00:41:15.181 --> 00:41:18.267
I'm the one asking the
fucking questions. understand?

725
00:41:18.267 --> 00:41:19.887
Even if they don't make sense?

726
00:41:19.887 --> 00:41:22.764
You got any drugs. weapons.
animals in the vehicle?

727
00:41:22.764 --> 00:41:24.421
Animals? What the fuck. bro?

728
00:41:24.421 --> 00:41:26.179
Like why are you asking
her those questions?

729
00:41:26.179 --> 00:41:27.012
I'm the one driving.

730
00:41:27.012 --> 00:41:29.096
Look. we've had reports
a theft in the area

731
00:41:29.096 --> 00:41:31.623
and you look like the suspect.

732
00:41:31.623 --> 00:41:34.123
License and registration. now.

733
00:41:36.387 --> 00:41:37.473
Put your hands-
Whoa!

734
00:41:37.473 --> 00:41:38.571
Where I can see 'em!

735
00:41:38.571 --> 00:41:42.180
Put your hands on the dash right now!

736
00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:45.015
Look. okay. so you
asked for her license.

737
00:41:45.015 --> 00:41:46.075
then she went for her license

738
00:41:46.075 --> 00:41:46.931
and now you're freaking out.

739
00:41:46.931 --> 00:41:50.299
so what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna grab her license

740
00:41:50.299 --> 00:41:52.231
and I'm gonna hand it to you. okay?

741
00:41:52.231 --> 00:41:55.471
All right. I want you
to take your two fingers

742
00:41:55.471 --> 00:41:57.943
and give me her license right now.

743
00:41:57.943 --> 00:42:02.567
Give it to me between the
two fingers. right here.

744
00:42:02.567 --> 00:42:03.631
Hand it right here.

745
00:42:03.631 --> 00:42:05.155
Right fuckin' here.

746
00:42:05.155 --> 00:42:08.155
And you don't fucking move one inch.

747
00:42:20.359 --> 00:42:22.192
You good. ma?

748
00:42:22.192 --> 00:42:23.775
No. I'm not good.

749
00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:27.671
I told you you were speeding
and you thought I was joking.

750
00:42:27.671 --> 00:42:30.615
That guy was gonna pull us
over no matter what we did.

751
00:42:30.615 --> 00:42:34.139
I was only going five
miles over the speed limit.

752
00:42:34.139 --> 00:42:36.079
Look. I'm sorry I almost got us killed.

753
00:42:36.079 --> 00:42:36.912
Us?

754
00:42:37.894 --> 00:42:40.311
No. you almost got me killed.

755
00:42:45.375 --> 00:42:49.385
What's taking him so long with my license?

756
00:42:55.259 --> 00:42:57.251
I fuckin' hate that shit.

757
00:43:00.351 --> 00:43:02.335
I tell you what I'm gonna do.

758
00:43:02.335 --> 00:43:03.972
I'm gonna go talk to him. okay?

759
00:43:03.972 --> 00:43:06.604
What? Are you crazy?

760
00:43:06.604 --> 00:43:08.578
He'll shoot you.

761
00:43:08.578 --> 00:43:11.744
Just. just please don't go. Bora.

762
00:43:11.744 --> 00:43:12.661
I'm scared.

763
00:43:13.594 --> 00:43:17.181
You know what I do when I'm
feeling scared or anxiety?

764
00:43:17.181 --> 00:43:19.431
I listen to relaxing music.

765
00:43:20.554 --> 00:43:23.996
Here. this is my
meditation playlist. okay?

766
00:43:23.996 --> 00:43:28.996
Put it on. take a deep
breath and just try to relax.

Okay?

768
00:43:30.383 --> 00:43:32.631

Hey Vinny.

I like that white couch your
wife got for the living room.

842
00:47:39.254 --> 00:47:42.587
It'd be a real shame to get blood on it.

00:48:23.139 --> 00:48:25.056
Gonna be long?

844
00:48:25.935 --> 00:48:27.465
Maybe.

00:48:27.465 --> 00:48:28.298
Maybe not.

846
00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:33.707
Why. are you gonna miss me when I'm gone?

847
00:48:35.949 --> 00:48:36.866
Hey wait.

00:48:42.611 --> 00:48:44.651
Don't leave me by myself.

849
00:48:44.651 --> 00:48:49.001

850
00:48:49.001 --> 00:48:50.456

00:50:47.808 --> 00:50:51.000
Whatever the fuck it is.
when I come to you Chino.

893
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.833
you know I usually get
double for that amount.

894
00:50:55.981 --> 00:50:58.981
Well. you ever heard of inflation?

895
00:51:01.763 --> 00:51:02.763
Inflation?

896
00:51:05.013 --> 00:51:07.807
I tell you what we're gonna do. hm?

897
00:51:08.852 --> 00:51:11.761
We're gonna take less. and so are you.

898
00:51:14.433 --> 00:51:15.479
Familia.

899
00:51:16.714 --> 00:51:18.973
How about you take double

900
00:51:18.973 --> 00:51:20.957
and then you leave that
chocolate ass here for me.

901
00:51:22.218 --> 00:51:23.915
Don't lust after
things you can't afford.

902
00:51:23.915 --> 00:51:24.824
Yeah. whatever. bitch.

903
00:51:26.381 --> 00:51:27.214
Suck this.

904
00:51:33.549 --> 00:51:36.533
Better be careful.
man. Bora's a bad bitch.

905
00:51:54.517 --> 00:51:55.350
Okay.

906
00:51:57.066 --> 00:51:58.634
Calm down. Elon. Calm down.

907
00:51:58.634 --> 00:52:00.483
Just breathe. just breathe.

908
00:52:00.483 --> 00:52:03.441
It's just drugs out there.

909
00:52:03.441 --> 00:52:04.979
There's drugs out there.

910
00:52:04.979 --> 00:52:07.342
What did Bora get me into?

911
00:52:11.223 --> 00:52:13.056
You have to calm down.

912
00:52:14.208 --> 00:52:15.619
It's just drugs out there.

913
00:52:24.928 --> 00:52:27.178
Everything's gonna be okay.

914
00:52:28.636 --> 00:52:29.469
Okay.

915
00:52:35.617 --> 00:52:36.950
It's just drugs.

916
00:53:50.092 --> 00:53:52.259
I like your dress.

917
00:53:54.251 --> 00:53:55.084
Thank you.

918
00:53:55.084 --> 00:53:56.394
Yeah. yeah you're welcome.

919
00:53:56.394 --> 00:53:58.084
You look good in it. you know.

920
00:53:58.084 --> 00:54:00.214
Even with those black stockings.

921
00:54:00.214 --> 00:54:02.552
I can tell you fine. girl.

922
00:54:02.552 --> 00:54:03.936
Just 'cause you're fine don't mean you get

923
00:54:03.936 --> 00:54:06.066
to go through people's shit.

924
00:54:06.066 --> 00:54:09.066
Um. I was just getting some water.

925
00:54:11.268 --> 00:54:12.824
Can I. is. is that okay?

926
00:54:12.824 --> 00:54:13.923
Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.

927
00:54:13.923 --> 00:54:15.469
You're thirsty. right?

928
00:54:15.469 --> 00:54:16.302
Yeah.

929
00:54:17.988 --> 00:54:19.405
I'm thirsty. too.

930
00:54:21.436 --> 00:54:25.441
But unfortunately nothing in life is free.

931
00:54:25.441 --> 00:54:26.984
Not even water.
You know it's-

932
00:54:26.984 --> 00:54:30.419
But. but. but I'm feeling generous

933
00:54:30.419 --> 00:54:32.675
and since I like chocolate.

934
00:54:32.675 --> 00:54:35.036
I'm gonna give you a
little discount. you hear?

935
00:54:35.869 --> 00:54:36.702
Stop.

936
00:54:38.996 --> 00:54:39.829
No. stop.

937
00:55:24.159 --> 00:55:26.095
Hey. love. What was your homeboy's name?

938
00:55:26.095 --> 00:55:29.574
Hmm? The one who grabbed
my girl's cho-cha?

939
00:55:29.574 --> 00:55:31.866
That's Christos.

940
00:55:31.866 --> 00:55:33.536
Christos. like Jesus Cristo?

941
00:55:33.536 --> 00:55:37.619
No. because Christos
grabs and grabs and grabs.

942
00:55:40.271 --> 00:55:42.047
Does Christos have a mother?

943
00:55:42.047 --> 00:55:44.479
I don't know what the bastard gots.

944
00:55:44.479 --> 00:55:46.229
You gonna tell on him?

945
00:55:46.229 --> 00:55:48.034
No. but you can tell her

946
00:55:48.034 --> 00:55:51.201
I said I'm sorry for her fucking loss.

947
00:55:52.103 --> 00:55:52.936
Oh.

948
00:55:54.175 --> 00:55:56.008
So this what we doin'?

949
00:55:57.243 --> 00:55:59.380
What's good. vato?

950
00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:03.963
If I gotta die. that means
everybody gotta fuckin' die.

951
00:56:11.073 --> 00:56:11.906
Okay.

952
00:56:15.095 --> 00:56:17.711
You ain't gonna shoot me.

953
00:56:17.711 --> 00:56:19.128
You ain't stupid.

954
00:56:21.703 --> 00:56:24.979
But I guess Christos deserved that.

955
00:56:24.979 --> 00:56:29.312
Got something for you.

956
00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:34.927
That should make it right.

957
00:56:35.951 --> 00:56:38.943
Hey ma. you ever seen
a dead body before. hm?

958
00:56:38.943 --> 00:56:40.103
Go look in the fuckin' kitchen.

959
00:56:40.103 --> 00:56:43.227
Hey. fuck you. Bora.
All this over some blow?

960
00:56:43.227 --> 00:56:44.727
Hm?

961
00:56:44.727 --> 00:56:47.583
Big Tio ain't gonna like this shit.

962
00:56:47.583 --> 00:56:52.539
You gonna have every ese
in LA gunning for your ass.

963
00:56:52.539 --> 00:56:54.660
This ain't about blow.

964
00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:56.674
This is about respect.

965
00:56:56.674 --> 00:56:59.371
So let them come. fucker.

966
00:57:09.813 --> 00:57:10.646
Whoa.

967
00:57:11.793 --> 00:57:13.293
That was dramatic.

968
00:57:17.035 --> 00:57:18.793
Okay. I gotta tell you
who you remind me of

969
00:57:18.793 --> 00:57:19.777
with this mask on.

970
00:57:19.777 --> 00:57:22.698
So there's a bitch down on Crenshaw-

971
00:57:22.698 --> 00:57:25.088
Matter of fact. I
saw her just the other day.

972
00:57:25.088 --> 00:57:26.217
You did?

973
00:57:26.217 --> 00:57:27.302
Okay. what did she say?

974
00:57:27.302 --> 00:57:31.264
Because she told me that I
should go to her shop but.

975
00:57:32.097 --> 00:57:34.156
I don't have money.

976
00:57:34.156 --> 00:57:37.132
She told me to
tell you that she heard

977
00:57:37.132 --> 00:57:40.016
there was a secret stash of secret cash

978
00:57:40.016 --> 00:57:42.842
somewhere in this house
and that you can have

979
00:57:42.842 --> 00:57:46.704
all the blow in this place if
you just tell me where it is.

980
00:57:46.704 --> 00:57:47.836
All right.

981
00:57:47.836 --> 00:57:50.336
Okay. so el dinero is upstairs

982
00:57:52.936 --> 00:57:55.265
in the apartment underneath the big bed.

983
00:57:55.265 --> 00:57:57.598

You're a fucking psycho.

I should have never picked you up.

1005
01:00:36.648 --> 01:00:37.481
You know what?

1006
01:00:37.481 --> 01:00:39.485
I didn't know that little girls

1007
01:00:39.485 --> 01:00:44.318
that wear leggings under
sundresses use so much profanity.

1008
01:00:45.428 --> 01:00:47.960
What is wrong with you?

1009
01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:50.281
We could have just bounced and what?

1010
01:00:50.281 --> 01:00:52.631
Now you're trying to flee
the murder scene in my car?

1011
01:00:52.631 --> 01:00:54.923
It's not like they're
gonna come after us.

1012
01:00:54.923 --> 01:00:57.060
They're dead. okay?

1013
01:00:57.060 --> 01:00:58.143
They're dead.

1014
01:00:59.562 --> 01:01:01.591
You know what?

1015
01:01:01.591 --> 01:01:05.829
You can have the car and everything in it.

1016
01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:07.953
I'll. I'll just walk.

1017
01:01:07.953 --> 01:01:11.011
I'll walk and I'll report
the car stolen in a few days

1018
01:01:11.011 --> 01:01:12.939
and you can have it all.

1019
01:01:12.939 --> 01:01:14.487
I don't. I don't want it.

1020
01:01:14.487 --> 01:01:17.327
Now why would you wanna
do a thing like that?

1021
01:01:17.327 --> 01:01:19.744
Why would anybody wanna do
a thing like that. Elon?

1022
01:01:19.744 --> 01:01:21.930
Someone is gonna come after us

1023
01:01:21.930 --> 01:01:23.580
and I don't wanna die or go to jail

1024
01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:27.163
for something that you
have us mixed up in.

1025
01:01:28.153 --> 01:01:30.241
This has nothing to do with me.

1026
01:01:30.241 --> 01:01:33.221
This got nothing to do with you?

1027
01:01:33.221 --> 01:01:36.862
That fool and his homie
were gonna fuckin' rape you.

1028
01:01:36.862 --> 01:01:38.802
They were gonna put a pistol to your head

1029
01:01:38.802 --> 01:01:40.439
and they were gonna record it

1030
01:01:40.439 --> 01:01:44.391
and it was gonna be
#CoCoPussy all over Instagram.

1031
01:01:44.391 --> 01:01:48.966
I fuckin' saved your life
and your reputation. huh?

1032
01:01:48.966 --> 01:01:51.044
I did what had to be done.

1033
01:01:51.044 --> 01:01:52.798
Besides. look around you Elon.

1034
01:01:52.798 --> 01:01:55.215
You see anybody following us?

1035
01:01:57.487 --> 01:01:59.779
You see any five-ohs?

1036
01:01:59.779 --> 01:02:02.646
Because I saw a couple
but they kept driving.

1037
01:02:02.646 --> 01:02:03.729
You know why?

1038
01:02:04.658 --> 01:02:08.825
Because all I see is open
roads and opportunities.

1039
01:02:10.272 --> 01:02:12.522
Open roads and clear skies.

1040
01:02:13.498 --> 01:02:14.436
Get in the car.

1041
01:02:14.436 --> 01:02:15.269
No.

1042
01:02:16.244 --> 01:02:18.077
- Get in the car.
- No.

1043
01:02:19.594 --> 01:02:21.662
You can have it.

1044
01:02:21.662 --> 01:02:24.030
I'm not doing this.

1045
01:02:24.030 --> 01:02:25.197
Ah. come on.

1046
01:02:26.721 --> 01:02:30.721
You're gonna make me spend
this money by myself?

1047
01:02:54.057 --> 01:02:58.189
Are you trying to fuck
with my emotions right now?

1048
01:02:58.189 --> 01:03:02.022
Did you ever walk 85
miles before. Elon? Hm?

1049
01:03:03.102 --> 01:03:04.781
Because that's how long
it's gonna take you

1050
01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:06.781
to get to the next town.

1051
01:03:10.526 --> 01:03:12.738
I noticed you were walking that way

1052
01:03:12.738 --> 01:03:15.321
and I'm driving that way. so...

1053
01:03:26.354 --> 01:03:27.910
And that's where you're
supposed to be like.

1054
01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:32.178
"Oh. I don't think my daddy
wants me talking to strangers."

1055
01:03:32.178 --> 01:03:37.178
And then I was like. "Oh. but
you're a soldier of the Lord."

1056
01:03:37.852 --> 01:03:39.274
Ah come on. lighten up a little.

1057
01:03:39.274 --> 01:03:41.623
Remember when we met and we
were talking about. like.

1058
01:03:41.623 --> 01:03:43.356
where we come from and then you were-

1059
01:03:43.356 --> 01:03:44.689
Shut up. Bora.

1060
01:03:47.154 --> 01:03:49.987
I swear. I'm out at the next town.

1061
01:03:50.970 --> 01:03:51.803

01:04:11.445 --> 01:04:13.501
About 45 miles.

1070
01:04:13.501 --> 01:04:15.168
Why. are you hungry?

1071
01:04:17.493 --> 01:04:19.241
Ah. come on. you can't
still be tripping off

1072
01:04:19.241 --> 01:04:21.058
that shit that happened earlier.

1073
01:04:21.058 --> 01:04:23.341
That was like three hours ago.

1074
01:04:23.341 --> 01:04:24.782
Friends fight.

1075
01:04:24.782 --> 01:04:25.996
Let it go.

1076
01:04:25.996 --> 01:04:27.569
Come on.
Fight?

1077
01:04:27.569 --> 01:04:29.962
I just watched two people get murdered

1078
01:04:29.962 --> 01:04:31.925
and a third was snorting up enough cocaine

1079
01:04:31.925 --> 01:04:34.402
to fill up the Lincoln Tunnel.

1080
01:04:34.402 --> 01:04:35.921
And friends?

1081
01:04:35.921 --> 01:04:38.509
Friends don't go on killing
sprees together. so no.

1082
01:04:38.509 --> 01:04:40.981
I'm not quite over it yet.

1083
01:04:40.981 --> 01:04:44.227
So you really have never
seen a dead buddy before. huh?

1084
01:04:44.227 --> 01:04:46.227
Who do you think I am?

1085
01:04:47.838 --> 01:04:51.237
What. you think Black
people just chill out.

1086
01:04:51.237 --> 01:04:55.570
posted up with dead bodies
on weekends or something?

1087
01:04:56.467 --> 01:04:58.340
Look. you know what you need?

1088
01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:00.742
You need to relax. you need to be present.

1089
01:05:00.742 --> 01:05:03.159
you need to be in the moment.

1090
01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:06.060
You ever try meditation?

1091
01:05:07.561 --> 01:05:08.478
Never. huh?

1092
01:05:11.009 --> 01:05:13.420
You know what I think we should do?

1093
01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:16.571
We should play a little game
called Never Have I Ever.

1094
01:05:16.571 --> 01:05:18.897
I mean usually we play with tequila. but.

1095
01:05:18.897 --> 01:05:23.064
this isn't my car so we
can play with our fingers.

1096
01:05:24.203 --> 01:05:26.917
What the fuck are you talking about?

1097
01:05:26.917 --> 01:05:29.425
You never heard of Never Have Ever?

1098
01:05:29.425 --> 01:05:32.738
So basically I say never have I ever

1099
01:05:32.738 --> 01:05:35.023
and then if you've done
whatever the thing is.

1100
01:05:35.023 --> 01:05:38.637
then you put one finger down
and then in the next round.

1101
01:05:38.637 --> 01:05:40.571
the other person says never have I ever

1102
01:05:40.571 --> 01:05:43.505
and the first person to
drop all five fingers loses

1103
01:05:43.505 --> 01:05:45.248
and the other person wins.

1104
01:05:45.248 --> 01:05:46.143
We used to play it in juvie

1105
01:05:46.143 --> 01:05:47.973
to get to know each other better.

1106
01:05:47.973 --> 01:05:48.806
Come on.

1107
01:05:54.997 --> 01:05:55.830
Fine.

1108
01:05:57.764 --> 01:05:58.902
I'll play.

1109
01:05:58.902 --> 01:06:01.624
But you can ask all the questions

1110
01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:03.237
'cause this is your dumbass idea.

1111
01:06:03.237 --> 01:06:04.404
Okay. ready?

1112
01:06:05.619 --> 01:06:08.369
Never have I ever killed a woman.

1113
01:06:10.369 --> 01:06:13.705
Bora. I just saw you murder two people!

1114
01:06:13.705 --> 01:06:15.245
Okay. you know what?

1115
01:06:15.245 --> 01:06:19.828
Never have I ever eaten pussy
with the girl's boyfriend

1116
01:06:23.141 --> 01:06:25.600
holding a pistol to my head.

1117
01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:28.525
Bora. I swear. if you
put a goddamn finger.

1118
01:06:28.525 --> 01:06:29.358
I'm walking the rest of the way.

1119
01:06:30.191 --> 01:06:32.024
Never have I ever...

1120
01:06:34.407 --> 01:06:38.740
Fucked a fine ass stranger
in a black Mercedes C300.

1121
01:06:48.225 --> 01:06:50.612
Hey. we should pull up
on these fools for real.

1122
01:06:50.612 --> 01:06:52.578
- Bora. no.
- They're so cute.

1123
01:06:52.578 --> 01:06:53.728
Can you. we're not
playing this game anymore.

1124
01:06:53.728 --> 01:06:54.895
Oh. come on.

1125
01:06:55.956 --> 01:07:00.085
You need to live a little.
No. we need to go.

1126
01:07:00.085 --> 01:07:03.412
- He's looking at us.
- I don't care.

1127
01:07:03.412 --> 01:07:05.662

Chad.

1184
01:09:21.822 --> 01:09:22.941
You like wine?

01:09:22.941 --> 01:09:25.641
I love wine. especially if it's white.

1186
01:09:26.734 --> 01:09:27.567
Funny.

1187
01:09:28.601 --> 01:09:29.985
Is this your car?

1188
01:09:29.985 --> 01:09:31.377
Yeah. You wanna check it out?

Mmm.

1191
01:09:36.513 --> 01:09:37.346
Is it new?

1192
01:09:38.605 --> 01:09:40.424
- Just got it.
- Buying or leasing?

1193
01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:42.489
Paid cash.

1194
01:09:42.489 --> 01:09:44.989
I don't got no herbs for you right now.

1195
01:09:44.989 --> 01:09:47.231
but I do got that fire ganja juice.

1196
01:09:47.231 --> 01:09:48.453
- Oh.

1197
01:09:48.453 --> 01:09:49.286

Salud.

1210
01:10:09.579 --> 01:10:11.971
So you like to salsa?
Are you into dancing?

1211
01:10:11.971 --> 01:10:13.973
- Uh. I can try.
- You can try?

1212
01:10:13.973 --> 01:10:15.159
Mm-hm.

1213
01:10:15.159 --> 01:10:17.629
By the looks of your
car. I think you can salsa.

1214
01:10:19.051 --> 01:10:20.981
So we're gonna take this hand

1215

Yo. yo. yo. What's up with it. mami?

1221
01:10:36.519 --> 01:10:37.971
How you doin'?

1222
01:10:37.971 --> 01:10:39.775
Don't. don't lean on the car.

1223
01:10:39.775 --> 01:10:41.469
- Oh. okay.
- You're gonna scratch it.

1224
01:10:41.469 --> 01:10:44.302
Okay. okay. okay. My bad. queen.

1225
01:10:46.405 --> 01:10:49.265
What's up with you? You got
a man back home or somethin'?

1226
01:10:49.265 --> 01:10:51.923
Look. you're cute and everything. but-

1227
01:10:51.923 --> 01:10:53.173
Ah. but what?

1228
01:10:54.442 --> 01:10:55.750
Yo. you need to relax.

1229
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:57.954
Yo. see. that's exactly why you met me

1230
01:10:57.954 --> 01:11:00.398
'cause I just got some ganja juice gummies

1231
01:11:00.398 --> 01:11:01.366
from the homie over there.

1232
01:11:01.366 --> 01:11:03.466
You wanna try some with me?

1233
01:11:03.466 --> 01:11:04.815
I don't really do gummies like that.

1234
01:11:04.815 --> 01:11:06.805
Oh. you don't do gummies?
You don't smoke nothin'?

1235
01:11:06.805 --> 01:11:07.872
No.

1236
01:11:07.872 --> 01:11:08.857
Ah. bullshit.

1237
01:11:08.857 --> 01:11:09.857
You hang around with a girl like that.

1238
01:11:09.857 --> 01:11:11.298
there ain't nothing that y'all don't do.

1239
01:11:11.298 --> 01:11:12.881
Don't give me that.

1240
01:11:18.866 --> 01:11:20.310
Don't compare me to her.

1241
01:11:21.763 --> 01:11:23.383
You know what they say.

1242
01:11:23.383 --> 01:11:26.091
Two birds of a feather flock together.

1243
01:11:26.091 --> 01:11:28.097
Besides. if it were me.

1244
01:11:28.097 --> 01:11:29.528
I personally wouldn't
wanna be hanging around

1245
01:11:29.528 --> 01:11:34.528
with someone that I didn't
wanna be compared to. so.

1246
01:11:34.531 --> 01:11:35.781
Anyway. I'm BJ.

1247
01:11:37.564 --> 01:11:38.755
I'm E.

1248
01:11:38.755 --> 01:11:40.059
E?

1249
01:11:40.059 --> 01:11:41.355
Like ecstasy?

1250
01:11:41.355 --> 01:11:42.967
Why would that be the first
thing that comes to mind?

1251
01:11:42.967 --> 01:11:43.985
I don't do drugs.

1252
01:11:43.985 --> 01:11:45.568
Okay. okay. okay.

1253
01:11:47.643 --> 01:11:48.643
No pressure.

1254
01:11:49.715 --> 01:11:52.267
What's wrong with you?

1255
01:11:52.267 --> 01:11:54.120
You won't get it.

1256
01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:58.203
Try me. I happen to be
a good reader of people.

1257
01:11:59.783 --> 01:12:02.535
What do you read about me?

1258
01:12:02.535 --> 01:12:03.766
Uh...

1259
01:12:03.766 --> 01:12:06.560
Okay. full disclosure. I
had a late night last night.

1260
01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.785
so my radar might be a little off.

1261
01:12:08.785 --> 01:12:11.202
but if I had to take a guess.

1262
01:12:14.252 --> 01:12:17.555
I'd say that whatever's chasing you.

1263
01:12:17.555 --> 01:12:18.615
ain't gonna stop chasing you

1264
01:12:18.615 --> 01:12:22.198
until you turn around
and face it. you dig?

1265
01:12:26.136 --> 01:12:27.774
I'm sorry.

1266
01:12:27.774 --> 01:12:28.607
I can't.

1267
01:12:30.711 --> 01:12:32.271
Okay. no worries.

1268
01:12:32.271 --> 01:12:33.968
No pressure.

1269
01:12:35.107 --> 01:12:36.747
Ecstasy.

1270
01:12:41.149 --> 01:12:43.075
It's BJ. right?

1271
01:12:43.075 --> 01:12:43.908
Yeah.

1272
01:12:46.156 --> 01:12:48.683
I think you should check on your friend.

1273
01:12:51.682 --> 01:12:56.682
Nah. Look like your homegirl
taking real good care of him.

1274
01:12:58.610 --> 01:12:59.443
Are you fucking kidding me?

1275
01:12:59.443 --> 01:13:00.495
No I'm not fucking with you.

1276
01:13:00.495 --> 01:13:01.995
Go get your fucking dollars.

1277
01:13:01.995 --> 01:13:03.210
I need you to run.

1278
01:13:03.210 --> 01:13:04.399
Give me my fucking money.

1279
01:13:04.399 --> 01:13:08.316
Run? Yo. what the fuck
wrong with your girl?

1280
01:13:09.177 --> 01:13:12.087
Oh what. let me guess. you
thought I lied to you. huh?

1281
01:13:12.087 --> 01:13:13.671
You are so fucking disrespectful.

1282
01:13:13.671 --> 01:13:15.168
Oh. I'm disrespectful?

1283
01:13:15.168 --> 01:13:16.969
I need you to run.

1284
01:13:16.969 --> 01:13:18.778
Yo. okay. whatever they got is whatever.

1285
01:13:18.778 --> 01:13:20.655
but I ain't the type of
nigga to run from shit.

1286
01:13:20.655 --> 01:13:21.535
you know what I'm saying?

1287
01:13:21.535 --> 01:13:23.129
Like. I know you used
to them other Rudy-poo

1288
01:13:23.129 --> 01:13:24.018
ass niggas in the past.

1289
01:13:24.018 --> 01:13:26.767
but I'm actually trying
to get to know you.

1290
01:13:26.767 --> 01:13:29.684
You got to the count of
three to give me my money.

1291
01:13:29.684 --> 01:13:31.818
I ain't giving you shit.

1292
01:13:31.818 --> 01:13:32.724
Uno...

1293
01:13:32.724 --> 01:13:33.931
I think you more than just cute.

1294
01:13:33.931 --> 01:13:35.118
I need you to run.

1295
01:13:35.118 --> 01:13:36.368
Dos...

1296
01:13:37.498 --> 01:13:38.331
Tres.

1297
01:13:38.331 --> 01:13:39.164
What the fuck? Are you serious?

1298
01:13:39.164 --> 01:13:40.850
Yo. what the fuck. man?

1299
01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:42.788
- Calm down. come on.
- Hey. hey. girl.

1300
01:13:42.788 --> 01:13:44.934
Yo. chill out. Ain't no need for all that.

1301
01:13:44.934 --> 01:13:46.306
You got this nice car.

1302
01:13:46.306 --> 01:13:48.510
you got these nice ass shoes on.

1303
01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:50.931
Give me my fucking money.

1304
01:13:50.931 --> 01:13:52.216
Oh my god. let's calm down.

1305
01:13:52.216 --> 01:13:53.049
Oh. let's calm down?

1306
01:13:53.049 --> 01:13:54.142
- Yeah. let's calm down.
- You like that?

1307
01:13:54.142 --> 01:13:54.978
- Come on.
- You like it when

1308
01:13:54.978 --> 01:13:55.937
it's in your face like that?

1309
01:13:55.937 --> 01:13:57.944
Aye. aye. fuckin' chill. yo.

1310
01:13:57.944 --> 01:14:00.640
Yo. get the. get the fuckin'
gun out my homeboy's face.

1311
01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:03.474
- Give me my fucking money.
- Take it easy.

1312
01:14:03.474 --> 01:14:04.307
Uno...

1313
01:14:05.748 --> 01:14:06.581
Dos...

1314
01:14:06.581 --> 01:14:07.764
Oh. shit.

1315
01:14:07.764 --> 01:14:08.597
- Tres.
- Wait.

1316
01:14:09.959 --> 01:14:11.244
Oh. oh. fu...

1317
01:14:11.244 --> 01:14:12.077
Run!

1318
01:14:15.605 --> 01:14:18.938
Aye. you're leaving the party already?

1319
01:14:20.303 --> 01:14:24.136
I thought it was going
well. What did you do?

1320
01:14:25.373 --> 01:14:26.897
Get in the car.

1321
01:14:26.897 --> 01:14:29.951
Unless you wanna take the
Benz. we can take the Benz.

1322
01:14:29.951 --> 01:14:31.201
Get in the car.

1323
01:14:33.165 --> 01:14:34.591
Get in the car.

Officials
are investigating

1331
01:14:56.838 --> 01:14:58.932
the series of killing
now that several people

1332
01:14:58.932 --> 01:15:01.330
were murdered in LA yesterday.

1333
01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:02.903
Now
they're saying the suspect

1334
01:15:02.903 --> 01:15:06.484
is a Black woman. which
I refuse to accept.

1335
01:15:06.484 --> 01:15:07.484
Why. Bora?

1336
01:15:09.264 --> 01:15:11.597
They were being nice to us.

1337
01:15:12.594 --> 01:15:14.511
They did nothing wrong.

1338
01:15:18.124 --> 01:15:19.957
Why would you do that?

1339
01:15:22.789 --> 01:15:24.539
They were safe. Bora.

1340
01:15:25.412 --> 01:15:26.458
They were safe.

1341
01:15:26.458 --> 01:15:27.291
Look.

1342
01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:33.298
I understand your pussy getting
wet off that dread head.

1343
01:15:33.298 --> 01:15:36.332
I really do. He was fine as fuck. okay?

1344
01:15:36.332 --> 01:15:39.582
But that white boy. he disrespected me.

1345
01:15:41.596 --> 01:15:42.429
What?

1346
01:15:44.332 --> 01:15:45.954
He disrespected you?

1347
01:15:45.954 --> 01:15:47.308
Mm-hm.

1348
01:15:47.308 --> 01:15:49.819
You were on top of him fucking him

1349
01:15:49.819 --> 01:15:51.483
in the backseat of the
car after knowing him

1350
01:15:51.483 --> 01:15:53.150
for like 20 minutes.

1351
01:15:55.794 --> 01:15:56.627
And...

1352
01:15:58.319 --> 01:16:02.542
You would've killed both them
if. if BJ didn't get away.

1353
01:16:02.542 --> 01:16:06.217
First of all. that was
not sex. it was work.

1354
01:16:06.217 --> 01:16:10.641
Secondly. you should know me
well enough by now to know. E.

1355
01:16:10.641 --> 01:16:14.239
that I would never shoot
a Black man in the back.

1356
01:16:14.239 --> 01:16:15.072
What?

1357
01:16:16.562 --> 01:16:20.121
You cut a black man's throat
less than 24 hours ago.

1358
01:16:20.121 --> 01:16:21.387
Yes.

1359
01:16:21.387 --> 01:16:24.510
To protect you. a Black woman.

1360
01:16:24.510 --> 01:16:26.415
And do I even get so much as a.

1361
01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:29.003
"Oh. Bora. thank you for saving my life."

1362
01:16:29.003 --> 01:16:31.538
or "O-M-G. Bora. thank
you for making a clean cut

1363
01:16:31.538 --> 01:16:32.882
in that fucker's throat as not

1364
01:16:32.882 --> 01:16:34.326
to get blood on my leggings."

1365
01:16:34.326 --> 01:16:35.159
No.

1366
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:39.703
But you don't hear me complaining.

1367
01:16:45.482 --> 01:16:48.315
You know what? I'm sorry. E. okay?

1368
01:16:49.758 --> 01:16:52.678
I don't wanna fight with you.

1369
01:16:52.678 --> 01:16:54.678
Besides. it's your turn.

1370
01:16:57.290 --> 01:16:58.123
Come on.

1371
01:17:00.398 --> 01:17:02.148
My turn to do what?

1372
01:17:03.998 --> 01:17:05.665
Never have I ever.

1373
01:17:07.847 --> 01:17:09.014
Fine. I'll go.

1374
01:17:09.982 --> 01:17:13.710
Never have I ever fucked a
white guy in a black Mercedes

1375
01:17:13.710 --> 01:17:16.378
who gave me $200 when this fucking pussy

1376
01:17:16.378 --> 01:17:17.954
never goes for less than a G

1377
01:17:17.954 --> 01:17:22.704
and so I had to merc him in
front of his fine ass friend.

1378
01:17:24.522 --> 01:17:26.772
Looks like you win. E. See?

1379
01:17:28.021 --> 01:17:28.854
Karma.

1380
01:18:11.292 --> 01:18:13.292
Good morning. Buttercup.

1381
01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:16.187
Please don't kill me.

1382
01:18:17.332 --> 01:18:18.848
You can take anything you
want. just please don't-

1383
01:18:20.682 --> 01:18:23.265
You scare so easily. sheesh.

1384
01:18:24.222 --> 01:18:25.055
Bora.

1385
01:18:26.926 --> 01:18:28.093
Get off of me.

1386
01:18:28.982 --> 01:18:30.149
Ah. come on.

1387
01:18:31.170 --> 01:18:32.674
Where are we?

1388
01:18:32.674 --> 01:18:34.616
I just wanted to make
sure you were alive.

1389
01:18:34.616 --> 01:18:36.054
like gave you some water.

1390
01:18:36.054 --> 01:18:38.238
All we had left was tequila.

1391
01:18:38.238 --> 01:18:39.886
You didn't respond to that.

1392
01:18:39.886 --> 01:18:40.788
You hit your head pretty hard

1393
01:18:40.788 --> 01:18:41.903
when you grabbed the steering wheel

1394
01:18:41.903 --> 01:18:43.417
and we hit that bump.

1395
01:18:43.417 --> 01:18:45.186
How you feeling?

1396
01:18:45.186 --> 01:18:47.321
Where are we and why do you keep wearing

1397
01:18:47.321 --> 01:18:49.521
that goddamn mask?

1398
01:18:49.521 --> 01:18:52.754
Because it's Day of the
Dead. Dia de Los Muertos.

1399
01:18:52.754 --> 01:18:55.193
When all the spirits come out to play.

1400
01:18:55.193 --> 01:18:58.167
so I figured I should
come out and play. too.

1401
01:18:58.167 --> 01:18:59.000
Hey. speaking of which.

1402
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.382
you're gonna need some sort of disguise.

1403
01:19:01.382 --> 01:19:04.427
Yeah. because they'll
never notice two POCs

1404
01:19:04.427 --> 01:19:07.877
wearing the faces of dead
in the ever so white desert.

1405
01:19:07.877 --> 01:19:10.917
Oh look. I got one for you. okay?

1406
01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:13.707
You know what?

1407
01:19:14.907 --> 01:19:18.816
This is the one that I use to
get out of speeding tickets.

1408
01:19:18.816 --> 01:19:21.978
If it work for me. it can work for you.

1409
01:19:21.978 --> 01:19:25.395
Especially since you don't have a record.

1410
01:19:26.233 --> 01:19:29.624
Well. at least not yet you don't.

1411
01:19:29.624 --> 01:19:31.362
but you get the point.

1412
01:19:31.362 --> 01:19:33.184
Where are we?

1413
01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:36.512
Where are you going?

1414
01:19:39.116 --> 01:19:39.949
Bora.

1415
01:19:42.306 --> 01:19:43.139
My car.

1416
01:19:44.643 --> 01:19:46.178
Somebody will drive by. eventually.

1417
01:19:48.614 --> 01:19:51.459
Hey. this view is amazing.
though. You can see for miles.

1418
01:19:53.924 --> 01:19:55.757
I already tried that.

1419
01:19:58.459 --> 01:20:00.474
You can be a little help right now.

1420
01:20:00.474 --> 01:20:02.415
You know what you should do?

1421
01:20:02.415 --> 01:20:05.638
Just take a moment and. like.
look around you at the sights.

1422
01:20:05.638 --> 01:20:07.353
Like look at this. You can see for miles.

1423
01:20:07.353 --> 01:20:08.436
It's amazing.

1424
01:20:11.177 --> 01:20:14.362
Can you help me figure this shit out?

1425
01:20:14.362 --> 01:20:18.362
Um. I don't really know
much about cars. love.

1426
01:20:19.274 --> 01:20:20.917
Hey. but I got a homeboy who's a mechanic.

1427
01:20:20.917 --> 01:20:21.922
You want me to call him?

1428
01:20:21.922 --> 01:20:25.458
No. I don't wanna meet
anyone else on this trip.

1429
01:20:25.458 --> 01:20:27.762
Oh no. you met him already. remember?

1430
01:20:27.762 --> 01:20:29.345
His name was Chino.

1431
01:20:30.334 --> 01:20:32.667
Oh. fuck. Did we kill Chino?

1432
01:20:33.834 --> 01:20:35.173
Damn.

1433
01:20:35.173 --> 01:20:37.489
We did. didn't we?

1434
01:20:37.489 --> 01:20:38.805
Yeah. I guess now wouldn't be a good time

1435
01:20:38.805 --> 01:20:40.979
to ask him for a favor.

1436
01:20:40.979 --> 01:20:42.182
Hey. you got AAA?

1437
01:20:42.182 --> 01:20:45.222
This is not the fucking time. Bora.

1438
01:20:45.222 --> 01:20:47.206
If now is not a good
time to call a mechanic.

1439
01:20:47.206 --> 01:20:48.956
I don't know when is.

1440
01:20:53.606 --> 01:20:55.790
Is that my phone?

1441
01:20:55.790 --> 01:20:57.638
Yeah. it is.
You want me to answer it?

1442
01:20:57.638 --> 01:21:00.536
No. give me my phone. Bora.

1443
01:21:00.536 --> 01:21:02.044
What are you gonna do if I don't?

1444
01:21:02.044 --> 01:21:04.127
Give me my phone. Bora.

1445
01:21:11.490 --> 01:21:13.490
Wait. wait. wait. wait.
wait. wait. wait. wait.

1446
01:21:13.490 --> 01:21:14.541
Can I tell you something?

1447
01:21:14.541 --> 01:21:17.463
No. Let me tell you something.

1448
01:21:17.463 --> 01:21:19.314
I left LA as a normal person

1449
01:21:19.314 --> 01:21:22.038
with a college degree and big dreams.

1450
01:21:22.038 --> 01:21:25.604
I had a good man with a
good heart and great friends

1451
01:21:25.604 --> 01:21:29.682
and no fucking problem
until you showed up.

1452
01:21:29.682 --> 01:21:32.408
Just because you come
from a shitty upbringing

1453
01:21:32.408 --> 01:21:35.038
with shitty parents
and no fucking friends.

1454
01:21:35.038 --> 01:21:39.038
you think you can come
into my life and ruin it?

1455
01:21:39.958 --> 01:21:42.791
Yeah. that might be a little naive

1456
01:21:43.658 --> 01:21:46.122
and you might be about that life.

1457
01:21:46.122 --> 01:21:48.455
but my life is worth living.

1458
01:21:51.587 --> 01:21:55.354
And I'm not gonna let you ruin that.

1459
01:21:55.354 --> 01:21:56.854
Do you understand?

1460
01:21:57.882 --> 01:21:59.965
I will never be like you.

1461
01:22:04.714 --> 01:22:05.964
Are you done?

1462
01:22:08.302 --> 01:22:11.442
You know you're really
sexy when you angry.

1463
01:22:12.410 --> 01:22:14.058
You know that?

1464
01:22:14.058 --> 01:22:16.970
I'm glad you find all of this amusing.

1465
01:22:16.970 --> 01:22:19.489
All you do is smoke pounds of weed.

1466
01:22:19.489 --> 01:22:21.866
screw and. and kill people.

1467
01:22:21.866 --> 01:22:24.366
And now you've run my car off
the road and almost kill us.

1468
01:22:24.366 --> 01:22:27.006
You're so fucking dramatic.

1469
01:22:27.006 --> 01:22:28.738
First of all. I told you.

1470
01:22:28.738 --> 01:22:32.542
never have I ever killed a woman. okay?

1471
01:22:32.542 --> 01:22:35.677
Never. So why would I
start with a Black woman?

1472
01:22:35.677 --> 01:22:39.094
What do I look like to you? Fuckin' LAPD?

1473
01:22:41.650 --> 01:22:46.483
Hey. speaking of LAPD. how did
it feel when that cop died?

1474
01:22:49.486 --> 01:22:52.653
Because I thought it felt pretty good.

1475
01:22:53.722 --> 01:22:54.555
What?

1476
01:22:57.705 --> 01:22:58.538
No.

1477
01:23:00.921 --> 01:23:01.754
No.

1478
01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:06.700
No. you told me he let us go.
Of course he let us go.

1479
01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:07.700
He was dead.

1480
01:23:14.895 --> 01:23:16.635
You killed a fucking cop?

1481
01:23:16.635 --> 01:23:17.990
I had to kill him.

1482
01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:20.114
If I didn't kill him.
he was gonna kill you

1483
01:23:20.114 --> 01:23:21.824
or some other fucking Black person

1484
01:23:21.824 --> 01:23:24.731
in another day or another week.

1485
01:23:24.731 --> 01:23:26.032
What did you want me to do?

1486
01:23:26.032 --> 01:23:26.865
No.

1487
01:23:30.382 --> 01:23:32.555
Give me my fucking phone.

1488
01:23:33.985 --> 01:23:36.182
I wouldn't
read that if I were you.

1489
01:23:36.182 --> 01:23:38.349
Well. you're not me. so.

1490
01:23:47.375 --> 01:23:52.375
"USC grad student kills boyfriend
and goes on murder spree?"

1491
01:23:54.108 --> 01:23:59.108
Why would she send me this?

1492
01:24:04.076 --> 01:24:04.909
No.

1493
01:24:06.178 --> 01:24:07.761
Why do you think?

1494
01:24:23.210 --> 01:24:24.127
No. Bora.

1495
01:24:36.118 --> 01:24:40.535
If I gotta die. that means
everybody gotta die. too.

1496
01:24:45.742 --> 01:24:47.909
You're not real. are you?

1497
01:24:50.431 --> 01:24:53.282
I'm as real as you allow me to be.

1498
01:24:53.282 --> 01:24:54.865
Don't overthink it.

1499
01:24:55.834 --> 01:24:59.190
Thoughts become things. remember?

1500
01:24:59.190 --> 01:25:01.940
I'm the best friend you ever had.

1501
01:25:22.084 --> 01:25:22.917
Come on.

1502
01:25:23.938 --> 01:25:26.907
Hey. remember when we
were at Chino's house

1503
01:25:26.907 --> 01:25:28.710
and you lured Christos into the kitchen

1504
01:25:28.710 --> 01:25:31.862
so you could see a dead body?

1505
01:25:44.099 --> 01:25:46.917
Hey. when I saw you hike your
skirt all up on your booty

1506
01:25:46.917 --> 01:25:50.352
so you could accidentally
get his attention.

1507
01:25:50.352 --> 01:25:51.495
bitch. I was low key proud.

1508
01:25:51.495 --> 01:25:54.412
I thought. "Damn. that's my bitch."

1509
01:25:55.897 --> 01:25:57.275
And you know what my favorite part

1510
01:25:57.275 --> 01:26:00.245
of this whole experience was?

1511
01:26:00.245 --> 01:26:01.785
When you distracted that dread head

1512
01:26:01.785 --> 01:26:05.025
so his friend could trick off on me.

1513
01:26:05.025 --> 01:26:07.608
That money paid for our dinner.

1514
01:26:08.641 --> 01:26:09.733
You even told him to run

1515
01:26:09.733 --> 01:26:13.897
so he didn't have to watch his
homie die when we shot him.

1516
01:26:13.897 --> 01:26:18.814
Hey. if that's not a good
friend. I don't know what is. ma.

1517
01:26:26.045 --> 01:26:28.628
Ah. you're so dramatic. Elon.

1518
01:26:29.761 --> 01:26:31.344
Remember that LAPD?

1519
01:26:32.529 --> 01:26:33.362
Mm.

1520
01:26:35.585 --> 01:26:38.335
I'm as real as you want me to be.

1521
01:27:07.525 --> 01:27:09.013
Bora!

1522
01:27:09.013 --> 01:27:10.049
Bora!

1523
01:27:10.049 --> 01:27:10.882

J. you and I both know.

01:27:47.902 --> 01:27:50.285
that Black women don't do stuff like this.

1533
01:27:50.285 --> 01:27:52.277
What do you think the motive was?

1534
01:27:52.277 --> 01:27:53.461
I don't know.

1535
01:27:53.461 --> 01:27:55.042
but they have multiple witnesses

1536
01:27:55.042 --> 01:27:58.194
who gave descriptions of
this chick with an afro.

1537
01:27:58.194 --> 01:28:02.241
The crazy thing is she was
wearing a Day of the Dead mask.

1538
01:28:02.241 --> 01:28:05.502
so nobody knows exactly
what she looks like.

1539
01:28:05.502 --> 01:28:07.248
Nobody
can confirm her identity.

1540
01:28:07.248 --> 01:28:10.294
so I don't believe it
and I won't believe it

1541
01:28:10.294 --> 01:28:14.170
until we have 100%
confirmation that she is Black.

1542
01:28:14.170 --> 01:28:17.275
It just don't make sense
to me. but it is Halloween.
