JAHSEH ONFROY:
Okay. guys. so here is my first vlog.

4
00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:21.980
Today. I am basically going
to tell you guys about myself

5
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.732
because I've never really let you in much.

6
00:00:23.732 --> 00:00:26.443
and I feel like that's
the best thing to do right now

7
00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:28.612
to ideally strengthen the bond.

8
00:00:28.612 --> 00:00:30.113
So. here's my room.

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:32.366
Uh. here's Stitch.

10
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.618
This is my favorite
Disney character. ever.

11
00:00:34.618 --> 00:00:35.827
He's very relatable.

12
00:00:39.665 --> 00:00:40.666
So...

13
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.377
today I am basically going

14
00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:45.462
to be telling you guys about myself.

15
00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:52.135
Uh. currently. I'm in
a huge state of paranoia.

16
00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:56.598
um. just due to m-my past

17
00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:57.933
and just the things and the people

18
00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:00.769
I've associated myself with previously.

19
00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.689
I've tried to put myself in a position

20
00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:07.484
to ideally be able
to motivate others to--

21
00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:09.695

like it's trying to get inside
of my mind. you know?

26
00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:21.790
I apologize for being so distant.

27
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.792
I've been paranoid.
I've been needing help.

28
00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:26.587

- In my situation.
they definitely should pay attention

to what I am as a person
rather than a character.

these two things together

He just didn't help us financially.

177
00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:15.764
I was 17 when I had him.

178
00:09:16.557 --> 00:09:18.350
In my case. I didn't have any support.

179
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:21.353
so it's just me paying rent.
paying all the bills.

180
00:09:21.353 --> 00:09:23.188
and having to work.

181
00:09:23.188 --> 00:09:24.481
And so. Jahseh was always

182
00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:27.776
with a babysitter or at daycare.

183
00:09:28.819 --> 00:09:31.280
I would make sure that he had
the best of everything.

184
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.322
for sure.

185
00:09:32.322 --> 00:09:34.116
I would say he was extremely spoiled.

186
00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:37.411
But I think he always felt alone.

187
00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:42.791
His father loved him. and he was present

188
00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:44.459
until he couldn't be.

189
00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:47.504
He got arrested after Jahseh turned 10.

190
00:09:47.504 --> 00:09:50.465
and he got 10 years in prison.

191
00:09:52.551 --> 00:09:55.762
He hasn't physically saw him in person.

192
00:09:56.388 --> 00:09:58.223
um. since then.

193
00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:01.768
JAHSEH: When I was growing up.
my mom tried to give me love

194
00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:03.395
by financially taking care of me

195
00:10:03.395 --> 00:10:05.189
because she's seen that
as the most important thing.

196
00:10:05.189 --> 00:10:07.941
As long as I ate.
and as long as I had clothes.

197
00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:09.776
and as long as I had a place to stay.

198
00:10:09.776 --> 00:10:11.445
that was the most important thing to her.

199
00:10:11.445 --> 00:10:14.281
She was never able
to emotionally nurture me.

200
00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:17.492
So. that left some sort
of self-hate for myself

201
00:10:17.492 --> 00:10:19.536
because I felt like I wasn't enough.

202
00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:20.913
you know. for a certain amount of time.

203
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.667
- There was. like.
a shift in his behavior.

204
00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:26.877
shift in his personality.

205
00:10:26.877 --> 00:10:29.296
At the age of 10.
he just started wildin' out.

206
00:10:30.047 --> 00:10:32.299
- He would. like. act up in school.

207
00:10:32.299 --> 00:10:35.469
You know. class disruption. fights a lot.

208
00:10:35.469 --> 00:10:38.138
I stayed on him 24/7.
and we would bump heads

209
00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:39.431
and we did not get along.

210
00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:44.353
When he was 13. we got him evaluated.

211
00:10:44.353 --> 00:10:46.688
and they told me that he was bipolar.

212
00:10:47.356 --> 00:10:49.525
They wanted me to put him
on medication. and I refused

213
00:10:49.525 --> 00:10:52.569
because where I'm from.
we don't label kids.

214
00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:54.404
and I don't really believe in. you know.

215
00:10:54.404 --> 00:10:56.448
dosing kids up with drugs
or anything like that.

216
00:10:56.448 --> 00:10:58.742
I would prefer going through counseling

217
00:10:58.742 --> 00:11:00.327
and trying to get
to the root of the problem.

218
00:11:00.327 --> 00:11:01.370
And we did that.

219
00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:04.331
It just got really. really bad.

220
00:11:04.331 --> 00:11:06.458
He was able to get kicked out

221
00:11:06.458 --> 00:11:09.127
of every school in our district.

222
00:11:09.127 --> 00:11:11.046

He started skipping school.

234
00:11:37.406 --> 00:11:39.950
At the time. he would always say.
"I wanna be a rapper."

he left home. nobody kicked him out.

328

And it was as a result of him
not wanting to follow the rules.

329

or not follow curfew.

330

00:23:30.869 --> 00:23:32.162
we were living it.

516
00:23:34.623 --> 00:23:36.792
- I think that's when things
started picking up for him

517
00:23:36.792 --> 00:23:38.210
because he started making better songs

518
00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:40.295
'cause he was able to jump
into that character.

519
00:23:40.295 --> 00:23:41.463
if you know what I mean?

520
00:23:41.463 --> 00:23:42.798
And on top of that. he was doing

521
00:23:42.798 --> 00:23:44.216
a lot of shit.
like he was beating niggas up

522
00:23:44.216 --> 00:23:45.133
on camera and shit.

523
00:23:46.134 --> 00:23:47.553
- Hey. Periscope.

524
00:23:47.553 --> 00:23:50.180
So. we got a very. very. very. very

525
00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:52.432
extra interesting story today.

526
00:23:52.432 --> 00:23:55.727
So. basically. this nigga
that owes us some cash

527
00:23:55.727 --> 00:23:58.146
pulled up to the crib.
and he thinks. like.

528
00:23:58.146 --> 00:23:59.565
he thinks we're cool with him.

529
00:23:59.565 --> 00:24:01.900
So. my manager was
letting him kick it in there.

530
00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.319
But basically. I'm about
to just beat this nigga's ass.

531
00:24:04.319 --> 00:24:06.113
and you guys get to watch it firsthand.

532
00:24:06.864 --> 00:24:09.074
BRUNO:
If anybody fucked with X's friends.

533
00:24:09.074 --> 00:24:10.742
X is going to deal with it.

534
00:24:11.368 --> 00:24:14.037
The kid he beats up in the bathroom
was somebody that owed me money.

535
00:24:14.037 --> 00:24:16.665
And I told the kid. man.
if you can't pay me the $500.

536
00:24:16.665 --> 00:24:18.083
we're going to have to fight this out.

537
00:24:18.083 --> 00:24:20.752
We're going to have
to record this for my website.

538
00:24:20.752 --> 00:24:22.713
Are you cool with it? He agreed with it.

539
00:24:23.797 --> 00:24:25.799
X pulls up. He's like. "Where's he at?"

540
00:24:25.799 --> 00:24:26.925
We need to shoot the scene.

541
00:24:26.925 --> 00:24:28.177
I was like. "He's in the house.

542
00:24:28.177 --> 00:24:29.428
"but we're doing the scene tomorrow.

543
00:24:29.428 --> 00:24:30.804
so please. can we just wait?"

544
00:24:30.804 --> 00:24:32.639
Because I know if you go
and try to fight him now.

545
00:24:32.639 --> 00:24:35.350
this thing's not going
to happen. you know?

546
00:24:35.976 --> 00:24:37.436
Yeah. and he didn't listen.

547
00:24:37.436 --> 00:24:39.313
[knocking on door]
MAN: Yeah.

548
00:24:39.313 --> 00:24:40.355
JAHSEH: Come here. bro.

549
00:24:41.231 --> 00:24:42.232
Come here.

550
00:24:46.403 --> 00:24:47.404
Fuck you...

551
00:24:47.404 --> 00:24:50.073
[grunting]

552
00:24:53.493 --> 00:24:54.995
SKI: Honestly. there'd
be times where I'd be like.

553
00:24:54.995 --> 00:24:56.371
"What the fuck is wrong with this guy?

554
00:24:56.371 --> 00:24:57.998
Is something not right with this guy?"

555
00:24:58.415 --> 00:25:00.959
That's when people didn't
really want to be around Jah.

556
00:25:00.959 --> 00:25:03.003
To be completely honest. a lot of people

557
00:25:03.003 --> 00:25:05.130
that was around Jah
didn't want to be around Jah

558
00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:06.840
before Jah got onto shit.

559
00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:09.092
People hated Jah. to be completely real.

560
00:25:10.677 --> 00:25:11.845
JAHSEH: Fuck.

561
00:25:13.096 --> 00:25:15.098
- Come on. Come on. brother?

562
00:25:17.434 --> 00:25:18.810
- Fucking play with me. bro.

563
00:25:19.978 --> 00:25:22.147
[indiscernible shouting]

564
00:25:22.147 --> 00:25:23.941
SKI:
He was a small dude. but he had

565
00:25:23.941 --> 00:25:26.068
a very loud Napoleon complex to him.

566
00:25:26.652 --> 00:25:28.570
I was always the person
that people would be coming to

567
00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:29.947
to calm Jahseh down.

568
00:25:29.947 --> 00:25:31.698
I basically was always the one

569
00:25:31.698 --> 00:25:33.242
that looked. looked him in the face.

570
00:25:33.242 --> 00:25:35.160
I'm just like. "I'm here. bro.

571
00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.537
and I'm going to be here for you."

572
00:25:36.537 --> 00:25:38.330
And I think I was one of the first people

573
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:39.915
to really do that for him

574
00:25:39.915 --> 00:25:42.334
and show him that I'm going
to love you either way.

575
00:25:42.334 --> 00:25:44.419
That's why he really
loved me and felt like

576
00:25:44.419 --> 00:25:46.171
I was one of his true.
really true best friends.

577
00:25:46.171 --> 00:25:47.840
Because no matter what crazy shit Jah did.

578
00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.299
I had to look him in the eye and hug him

579
00:25:49.299 --> 00:25:51.677
and tell him I loved him
for him to understand

580
00:25:51.677 --> 00:25:53.136
that you're going to get better.

581
00:25:53.136 --> 00:25:54.805
Jah hated himself

582
00:25:54.805 --> 00:25:57.766
at one point. and a lot of points.

583
00:26:04.106 --> 00:26:05.732
- Uh. emotions.

584
00:26:05.732 --> 00:26:07.067
He probably-- I felt like he hated

585
00:26:07.067 --> 00:26:08.819
his own anger. you know what I mean?

586
00:26:08.819 --> 00:26:11.780
And he was trying to learn
how to control that.

587
00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:13.115
His emotions. basically.

588
00:26:13.532 --> 00:26:14.950
And not let them to get the best of him.

589
00:26:15.492 --> 00:26:17.452
That was really just his biggest battle.

590
00:26:17.452 --> 00:26:19.288
himself really. yeah.

591
00:26:22.374 --> 00:26:25.627
It took a series of things
for Jah to get the way he was.

592
00:26:25.627 --> 00:26:27.087
I mean. Jah used to tell me he used to see

593
00:26:27.087 --> 00:26:29.089
his mom get beat up when he was younger

594
00:26:29.089 --> 00:26:30.382
or some shit like that. Cleo.

595
00:26:34.595 --> 00:26:36.638
CLEOPATRA: His dad tried
to put his hands on me a few times.

596
00:26:37.139 --> 00:26:38.849
It didn't work out well.

597
00:26:38.849 --> 00:26:40.100
I didn't call the cops on him

598
00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.144
because where I'm from. that's also taboo.

599
00:26:42.144 --> 00:26:43.770
But I hauled ass real quick.

600
00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:45.689
I wasn't about to be nobody's. um--

601
00:26:46.648 --> 00:26:49.276
You know. my story don't go like that.

602
00:26:51.445 --> 00:26:54.198
You know. we're Jamaican.
so we're used to ass whoopings.

603
00:26:54.198 --> 00:26:57.075
Like. we get our ass beat.
like. with hoses

604
00:26:57.075 --> 00:26:59.912
and two-by-fours and you name it.

605
00:26:59.912 --> 00:27:02.039
And so it's passed on
from generation to generation.

606
00:27:03.457 --> 00:27:05.626
I don't know if his dad beaten
him with anything crazy.

607
00:27:05.626 --> 00:27:07.169
but he would. he would snuff him

608
00:27:07.169 --> 00:27:09.254
and he would. like. beat him

609
00:27:09.254 --> 00:27:11.673
if he would tell him
to study his timetables.

610
00:27:11.673 --> 00:27:13.425
if he would get something wrong.

611
00:27:13.425 --> 00:27:15.719
so whenever he would get
in problems at school.

612
00:27:15.719 --> 00:27:17.095
Dad would come give him a whooping.

613
00:27:17.095 --> 00:27:18.388
A good one.

614
00:27:18.388 --> 00:27:19.640
Um. but he wasn't abusive.

615
00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.767
I wouldn't say he was abusive
or anything like that.

616
00:27:26.605 --> 00:27:29.399
- We was born into a world
that taught us that men have to fight.

617
00:27:29.399 --> 00:27:31.235
and this has been going on
for thousands of years

618
00:27:31.235 --> 00:27:32.694
before we even came here.

619
00:27:32.694 --> 00:27:34.947
So. this is the way the world works.

620
00:27:35.322 --> 00:27:37.157
Our parents. big brothers. big cousins

621
00:27:37.157 --> 00:27:38.659
don't want us to be at a disadvantage.

622
00:27:38.659 --> 00:27:41.662
So. when my big cousins used to be beating
my ass as a kid.

623
00:27:41.662 --> 00:27:44.790
they was training me to not get
my ass beat as an adult.

624
00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:47.793
- Same on this end.
- So. at the same time. it's. like.

625
00:27:47.793 --> 00:27:51.964
it might affect us negatively. personally.

626
00:27:51.964 --> 00:27:55.342
but generally. generally. you feel me?

627
00:27:55.342 --> 00:27:57.636
Generally. it. it protects us.

628
00:27:58.178 --> 00:28:00.180
It's. it's. your weapon can also be

629
00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:01.849
the same thing that kills you.

630
00:28:03.851 --> 00:28:06.228
JAHSEH: If you got a fear.
you can. it's hard to be angry.

631
00:28:06.228 --> 00:28:08.313
If you got someone that
you're scared of in your life.

632
00:28:08.313 --> 00:28:09.439
it's real hard to be angry.

633
00:28:10.649 --> 00:28:12.609
Dad got locked up when I was. like. 10.

634
00:28:12.609 --> 00:28:14.444
Who was I to fear. my mom?

635
00:28:14.444 --> 00:28:15.821
Who was I to fear. some stranger?

636
00:28:16.697 --> 00:28:18.240
I feared nobody.

637
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.367
So. my anger took control.

638
00:28:20.367 --> 00:28:22.327
And whenever anybody
would do anything to me.

639
00:28:22.327 --> 00:28:23.412
I would act out on.

640
00:28:24.705 --> 00:28:26.832
Fear left. so anger replaced it.

641
00:28:32.004 --> 00:28:33.547
MAN: Ohh!

642
00:28:36.675 --> 00:28:38.969
MAN: Like everything
that he did. when it came

643
00:28:38.969 --> 00:28:41.597
to beefin'. fightin'. and poppin' off.

644
00:28:41.597 --> 00:28:44.016
even though it was
mental instability there.

645
00:28:44.016 --> 00:28:45.893
he would still go on live and he recorded

646
00:28:45.893 --> 00:28:48.437
knowing goddamn well
this is good for my career.

647
00:28:49.396 --> 00:28:51.398
- I guess he just knew
what they wanted to see.

648
00:28:51.398 --> 00:28:52.941
and he just took advantage of it.

649
00:28:52.941 --> 00:28:54.401
just like anybody else would.

656

JAHSEH: I would do
little things that I knew

657
00:29:16.757 --> 00:29:18.342
would get people's attention.

658
00:29:18.342 --> 00:29:19.885
This is what people want to see.

659
00:29:19.885 --> 00:29:21.220
I said. I know what you wanted.

660
00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:23.180
And then I just started marketing bullshit

661
00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:25.849
that I knew the kids would like
to get them to go on my page

662
00:29:25.849 --> 00:29:27.643
because obviously. I would
post this shit on my page.

663
00:29:27.643 --> 00:29:29.478
And then they would be like.
oh. this nigga makes music.

664
00:29:29.478 --> 00:29:31.939
Let me try. Let me listen
to this and see what it's like.

665
00:29:31.939 --> 00:29:34.066
And then I would catch you.
That's how I would catch you.

666
00:29:34.858 --> 00:29:37.778
BASS: Jahseh would make us
make multiple Twitter accounts.

667
00:29:37.778 --> 00:29:39.738
Twenty-five people in the chat.
and each of those people have

668
00:29:39.738 --> 00:29:41.406
at least five different Twitter accounts.

669
00:29:41.406 --> 00:29:42.866
and we all retweeting this stuff.

670
00:29:42.866 --> 00:29:44.034
FLYBOY: Mm-hm.

671
00:29:44.034 --> 00:29:45.911
- And we all gonna sit there on Twitter

672
00:29:45.911 --> 00:29:48.789
and talk shit to anybody
that come in there talking shit

673
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:51.333
and just fuck up
the algorithms in our favor

674
00:29:51.333 --> 00:29:53.126
- to just like...
- Draw attention.

675
00:29:53.126 --> 00:29:55.963
It was all planned out and very strategic.

676
00:29:55.963 --> 00:29:58.590
[crowd shouting]

677
00:29:58.590 --> 00:29:59.967
MAN: Fuck y'all. nigga!

678
00:30:02.219 --> 00:30:04.179
MAN 2: Let him stand up.
Let him stand up.

679
00:30:04.179 --> 00:30:08.350
[indiscernible shouting]

680
00:30:09.935 --> 00:30:12.271
- All these people want to see
is us destroy each other.

681
00:30:12.855 --> 00:30:14.439
That's what. that's what they pay for.

682
00:30:14.439 --> 00:30:16.400
- All controversy.
- Mm-hm.

683
00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:19.069
- So. if you're telling us.
if you're paying us

684
00:30:19.069 --> 00:30:21.989
to destroy each other.
then we will become gladiators.

855
00:37:35.547 --> 00:37:37.049
It had its good moments and bad moments.

856
00:37:37.049 --> 00:37:39.801
but mostly. like. I was lost.

857
00:37:39.801 --> 00:37:42.054
I didn't really know. like.
what to do about it.

858
00:37:45.474 --> 00:37:49.645
[crowd shouting]

859
00:37:51.688 --> 00:37:54.191
- Woo. I'm already tired...

860
00:37:54.816 --> 00:37:59.112
[indiscernible]

861
00:37:59.112 --> 00:38:00.531
[crowd cheers]

862
00:38:04.076 --> 00:38:05.494
COOLIECUT:
He was kind of buzzing at that point.

863
00:38:05.494 --> 00:38:07.913
He was making. like. underground hits.
you know what I mean?

864
00:38:08.622 --> 00:38:09.998
And then people start peepin' like.

865
00:38:09.998 --> 00:38:12.125
"Oh. he might be the next
one up." you feelin' me?

866
00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.711
- Okay. I'm tired. I'm tired.

867
00:38:14.711 --> 00:38:16.672
Tired. [laughs]

868
00:38:17.422 --> 00:38:18.757
COOLIECUT:
But I'm not gonna lie.

869
00:38:18.757 --> 00:38:22.177
I think his mind state
was very bad at that point.

870
00:38:24.596 --> 00:38:27.349
The thing about Jah is.
if you weren't that close to him.

871
00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:28.642
he didn't really want you to see.

872
00:38:28.642 --> 00:38:30.602
like. his true personality sometimes.

873
00:38:30.602 --> 00:38:33.146
So. he always. you feel me.
throwing a little mask

874
00:38:33.146 --> 00:38:35.524
or something to try to hide
how he's feeling in the moment.

875
00:38:35.524 --> 00:38:37.651
So. that's how he was
treating me at that time.

876
00:38:37.651 --> 00:38:39.570
He was trying to be very calm.
You feel me?

877
00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:41.154
"Yo. what's good? How you doing?"

878
00:38:41.154 --> 00:38:42.781
But he was in a bad mental state though.

879
00:38:42.781 --> 00:38:44.825
I could tell.
Yeah.

880
00:38:50.998 --> 00:38:53.292
- This is the first time
I'm letting them see my hair.

881
00:38:54.209 --> 00:38:56.170
My hair is just a reminder of telling me

882
00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:58.088
to. to fucking relax. basically.

883
00:38:58.088 --> 00:39:00.674
It's a. it's a reminder
of me telling myself that.

884
00:39:00.674 --> 00:39:03.302
"Yo. you are human
and that you are not a god.

885
00:39:03.302 --> 00:39:05.179
"You are still on the planet Earth.

886
00:39:05.179 --> 00:39:07.764
"And that you need to remind yourself
that karma is a real thing.

887
00:39:07.764 --> 00:39:09.892
And whatever you give out.
you will get back."

888
00:39:11.101 --> 00:39:13.437
CLEOPATRA:
I knew that something was off.

889
00:39:14.188 --> 00:39:15.981
The voices in the head came.

890
00:39:15.981 --> 00:39:18.525
He would tell me. like.
he would not sleep at night.

891
00:39:18.525 --> 00:39:21.195
And he would tell me he hears voices.

892
00:39:22.029 --> 00:39:23.947
SKI:
Literally. he'd be like. "Oh. I took LSD.

893
00:39:23.947 --> 00:39:25.949
"and I've talked to a spirit
that's a demon

894
00:39:25.949 --> 00:39:28.368
"and told me information about myself.

895
00:39:28.368 --> 00:39:30.037
"about how long I'm gonna live.

896
00:39:30.037 --> 00:39:32.372
that they're going to come
get him at some point."

897
00:39:32.372 --> 00:39:34.291
I really didn't like
that shit at that point.

898
00:39:36.126 --> 00:39:37.711
- Yeah. it was a very dark time.

899
00:39:40.088 --> 00:39:41.965
- And if I end up getting shot and killed

900
00:39:41.965 --> 00:39:43.550
for what the fuck I'm doing

901
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:46.136
or if I end up getting my ass
beat at some point in time

902
00:39:46.136 --> 00:39:47.679
or nigga. if shit get hard on me.

903
00:39:47.679 --> 00:39:48.847
it's because I deserve it.

904
00:39:48.847 --> 00:39:50.140
That's point blank. period.

905
00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:52.142
Everybody will get a death--

906
00:39:52.142 --> 00:39:54.102
Everybody will get a death
that is deserving.

907
00:39:54.102 --> 00:39:55.646
Everybody will get a life
that is deserving.

908
00:39:55.646 --> 00:39:58.065
Everybody-- You will get
what the fuck you deserve.

909
00:39:58.065 --> 00:39:59.024
Karma.

910
00:40:05.822 --> 00:40:08.700
TALYSSA LEE:
I was 23 in the summer of 2016

911
00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:10.160
when I met Jahseh.

912
00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.746
I was at the time dating Khaed Moulton.

913
00:40:12.746 --> 00:40:14.414
which was his producer.

914
00:40:14.414 --> 00:40:16.917
Jahseh was about 18 at the time.

915
00:40:16.917 --> 00:40:18.544
Jahseh was not a monster.

916
00:40:18.544 --> 00:40:20.254
Like. when I met him.
he was very charming.

917
00:40:20.254 --> 00:40:21.630
very intelligent.

918
00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:23.090
empathetic. in a sense.

919
00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:25.259
Like. damn near surprised me.

920
00:40:27.845 --> 00:40:30.430
The first day I saw Geneva
when she came out.

921
00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:32.140
she was wearing a hoodie.

922
00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:34.268
She just wasn't making
eye contact with anybody.

923
00:40:34.268 --> 00:40:36.436
She'd look up and just.
like. go back down.

924
00:40:36.436 --> 00:40:38.772
She was literally just
a shell of a person.

925
00:40:38.772 --> 00:40:41.024
Like. there was just no expression.

926
00:40:41.024 --> 00:40:42.067
There was nothing.

927
00:40:42.609 --> 00:40:45.153
I felt like her soul
was empty at the time.

928
00:40:45.153 --> 00:40:46.154
You know?

929
00:40:50.075 --> 00:40:53.078
One day. Khaed cracked a joke in the car.

930
00:40:53.078 --> 00:40:54.329
She kind of giggled and laughed.

931
00:40:55.289 --> 00:40:58.333
And Jahseh. like. cut his eyes
to her and was like.

932
00:40:58.333 --> 00:41:00.127
when we get to the house. go in the room.

933
00:41:00.711 --> 00:41:02.921
And I was kind of like. "What the fuck?"

934
00:41:02.921 --> 00:41:05.757
It kind of became clear
that he was not happy

935
00:41:05.757 --> 00:41:07.384
with her laughing at his joke.

936
00:41:08.927 --> 00:41:11.180
They went in the room.
and I could hear them fighting.

937
00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:13.515
Eventually. you just hear somebody

938
00:41:13.515 --> 00:41:15.225
who's getting hit.

939
00:41:15.225 --> 00:41:17.686
Jahseh had a bathroom in that.
a private bathroom in the room.

940
00:41:18.312 --> 00:41:20.689
So. you could hear water running
and I'm thinking.

941
00:41:20.689 --> 00:41:22.691
"Okay. maybe they're going
to take a shower or whatever."

942
00:41:22.691 --> 00:41:24.276
But no.

943
00:41:25.444 --> 00:41:27.529
He was literally drowning her in the tub.

944
00:41:27.529 --> 00:41:29.698
like putting her under.
and you could hear her screams

945
00:41:29.698 --> 00:41:31.783
being muffled by the water
and being put up

946
00:41:31.783 --> 00:41:33.535
and then being put back under the water.

947
00:41:33.535 --> 00:41:36.371
And I was banging on the door.
begging Khaed like.

948
00:41:36.371 --> 00:41:38.415
"Bro. I'm calling the cops."
and he's begging me.

949
00:41:38.415 --> 00:41:39.750
"Don't call the cops. bro."

950
00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:41.460
Like. you know
I got a situation in Georgia.

951
00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:42.669
which he did.

952
00:41:42.669 --> 00:41:44.796
So. I didn't. Big regret.

953
00:41:45.881 --> 00:41:48.383
Later that night.
she finally came out again

954
00:41:48.383 --> 00:41:49.968
and she. like. picked up her hoodie

955
00:41:49.968 --> 00:41:51.762
and she was marked up with bruises

956
00:41:51.762 --> 00:41:54.389
like a Dalmatian.
like a bruise behind her ear.

957
00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:56.934
behind her neck. literally everywhere.

958
00:41:56.934 --> 00:42:00.062
And it was very clear that
he was avoiding hitting her face

959
00:42:00.062 --> 00:42:02.606
so that she wouldn't have
any. like. clear injuries

960
00:42:02.606 --> 00:42:04.066
when you were talking to her.

961
00:42:04.066 --> 00:42:06.151
I've never seen somebody
bruised up so bad.

962
00:42:08.862 --> 00:42:11.114
It was just very clear like
she didn't have nobody.

963
00:42:11.114 --> 00:42:12.533
Like. she didn't have any money.

964
00:42:12.533 --> 00:42:14.451
she didn't have any family support.

965
00:42:14.451 --> 00:42:16.995
So. in a situation like that.
when people are like.

966
00:42:16.995 --> 00:42:18.830
"Why don't you leave.
why don't you leave?"

967
00:42:18.830 --> 00:42:21.208
And you really don't.
you think that that person

968
00:42:21.208 --> 00:42:24.127
is literally your foundation
and your network to life.

969
00:43:07.462 --> 00:43:09.173
TALYSSA:
They all knew what was going on.

970
00:43:09.173 --> 00:43:11.967
and they were so caught up in his clout

971
00:43:11.967 --> 00:43:14.052
and having his respect.

972
00:43:14.052 --> 00:43:15.929
they would never go against
what he was saying.

973
00:43:16.471 --> 00:43:18.765
It was like the weight of that person.

974
00:43:18.765 --> 00:43:21.393
it was zero compared to their potential

975
00:43:21.393 --> 00:43:23.020
to make it with Jahseh.

976
00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:25.814
So. there was just
no incentive to step in.

977
00:43:28.734 --> 00:43:30.319
COOLIECUT: You know how
you got that little voice in your head

978
00:43:30.319 --> 00:43:31.695
and it'd be like. "Yo. don't do that."

979
00:43:32.237 --> 00:43:33.655
I don't think he had that

980
00:43:33.655 --> 00:43:35.616
in certain moments.
if you get what I'm saying.

981
00:43:35.616 --> 00:43:37.242
So. he used to just be like.
"Bro. niggas tryin' me.

982
00:43:37.242 --> 00:43:39.161
All right. let's go." You feel me?

983
00:43:39.161 --> 00:43:41.288
That-- So. if you don't have
that in your head.

984
00:43:41.288 --> 00:43:43.290
you kind of got to have
somebody around you

985
00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:45.584
to be like. "Yo. bro. we good. bro.

986
00:43:45.584 --> 00:43:48.337
It's not that big of a deal."
You feel me? Let's just vibe."

987
00:43:48.337 --> 00:43:50.005
And I don't think. that was the thing.

988
00:43:50.005 --> 00:43:52.299
I don't really think
he had that in Orlando.

989
00:44:02.601 --> 00:44:05.938
- He was in jail and I was
with a group of his friends.

990
00:44:05.938 --> 00:44:07.981
You know. they were. like.
taking care of me and stuff

991
00:44:07.981 --> 00:44:09.733
while. until he got back.

992
00:44:11.151 --> 00:44:14.613
And I ended up cheating
on Jahseh with his homeboy.

993
00:44:18.825 --> 00:44:20.452
Once it came out. like.

994
00:44:21.119 --> 00:44:23.247
Jahseh at first said
that he would deal with it

995
00:44:23.247 --> 00:44:24.623
and he would get over it.

996
00:44:24.623 --> 00:44:28.544
But he couldn't get over it. it seemed.

997
00:44:34.883 --> 00:44:36.802
BRUNO:
He did come to me and was like.

998
00:44:36.802 --> 00:44:38.679
"Hey. Geneva's pregnant. what do I do?"

999
00:44:39.263 --> 00:44:41.765
And I couldn't really answer
that question.

1000
00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:44.476
I don't know. I was like. "Oh.

1001
00:44:45.686 --> 00:44:47.437
Just be there for her. that's it."

1002
00:44:48.146 --> 00:44:50.357
You know? But it can't be here.

1003
00:44:51.191 --> 00:44:52.568
Especially now that she's pregnant.

1004
00:45:04.746 --> 00:45:07.124
TALYSSA: If I was there. I don't think
it would have went that far.

1005
00:45:08.125 --> 00:45:10.085
I don't think I would have
left Geneva alone

1006
00:45:10.085 --> 00:45:11.378
for a second with him.

1007
00:45:11.378 --> 00:45:13.005
and that's what happened
when she was attacked.

1008
00:45:13.005 --> 00:45:14.173
she was left alone.

1009
00:45:21.638 --> 00:45:23.098
From what I understand. like.

1010
00:45:23.098 --> 00:45:25.058
they held her there
for. like. three or four days

1011
00:45:25.058 --> 00:45:26.810
and wouldn't let her see the hospital.

1012
00:45:27.895 --> 00:45:29.730
I remember when she said how she escaped.

1013
00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:31.899
'cause I was like. "How the fuck
did you get out of that shit?"

1014
00:45:34.026 --> 00:45:36.778
He was playing PlayStation
or Xbox or something.

1015
00:45:36.778 --> 00:45:38.530
and she opened up the fridge

1016
00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:40.699
and kind of let that be a distraction.

1017
00:45:40.699 --> 00:45:42.492
like she was looking in the fridge.

1018
00:45:42.492 --> 00:45:44.745
and she says she got on her. her fours

1019
00:45:44.745 --> 00:45:47.539
and crawled out of the house
while the fridge was still open

1020
00:45:47.539 --> 00:45:48.624
and ran out.

1021
00:45:53.962 --> 00:45:55.881
GENEVA:
I had nowhere to run.

1022
00:45:55.881 --> 00:45:59.301
I don't have any brothers.
I don't have a father figure.

1023
00:45:59.301 --> 00:46:00.677
Nobody was going to come save me.

1024
00:46:00.677 --> 00:46:02.804
I had to leave.

1025
00:46:02.804 --> 00:46:04.723
I felt like it was going to get worse.

1026
00:46:05.557 --> 00:46:10.062
The first person I called
when I ran away from the house

1027
00:46:10.062 --> 00:46:12.814
was my ex-boyfriend because
literally besides my mom.

1028
00:46:12.814 --> 00:46:15.025
that was like the only
phone number I knew by heart.

1029
00:46:15.025 --> 00:46:16.902
And he seen my face and he's like.

1030
00:46:16.902 --> 00:46:19.112
"Okay. this is crazy.
I have to call my mom."

1031
00:46:19.821 --> 00:46:22.157
His mother was like.
"She can't be with you

1032
00:46:22.157 --> 00:46:23.992
because they're going
to think you did that."

1033
00:46:24.952 --> 00:46:27.287
She literally drove me to the station.

1034
00:46:27.287 --> 00:46:29.998
She was like. "Go. 'cause you're
not staying with us like that."

1035
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:33.377
I didn't want nobody to go to jail.

1036
00:46:33.377 --> 00:46:35.379
but I didn't know what to do.

1037
00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:38.632
I wasn't aware that that would
all. like. crumble down

1038
00:46:38.632 --> 00:46:39.842
onto him like that.

1039
00:46:46.473 --> 00:46:48.350
DEANDRA:
You got to be fucking kidding me.

1040
00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:49.601
Like. that's the first thing
I thought. like.

1041
00:46:49.601 --> 00:46:51.395
"You got to be fucking kidding me."

1042
00:46:51.395 --> 00:46:54.356
Like. how... how... [stammers]

1043
00:46:54.356 --> 00:46:55.691
Like. you just gotta
be fucking kidding me.

1044
00:46:55.691 --> 00:46:57.651
Like. there was no other way
to think about it.

1045
00:46:58.902 --> 00:47:01.572
- You know. I knew he was a lot of things
and get into a lot of shit.

1046
00:47:01.572 --> 00:47:03.240
but that. that was new to me.

1047
00:47:04.074 --> 00:47:05.659
That part was foreign to me.

1048
00:47:07.703 --> 00:47:10.289
I was shocked at how bad it was.

1049
00:47:27.973 --> 00:47:30.976
He was already out on bond
when that incident happened.

1050
00:47:31.727 --> 00:47:33.353
He had racked up so many points that.

1051
00:47:33.353 --> 00:47:36.023
you know. he was going to jail
for a very long time.

1052
00:47:38.358 --> 00:47:39.860
DEANDRA:
Cleo. in her mind was like.

1053
00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:41.236
I'm going to have to take care
of him his whole life

1054
00:47:41.236 --> 00:47:43.864
because he has a record.
tattoos on his face.

1055
00:47:43.864 --> 00:47:46.200
Like. it was exhausting. just running.

1056
00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:48.785
like. not knowing what
the next option was for him.

1057
00:47:56.084 --> 00:47:57.836
- When he called me. I was really nervous.

1058
00:47:57.836 --> 00:48:00.088
I was like. "Okay.
this is a jail phone call."

1059
00:48:00.672 --> 00:48:01.798
I answer it.

1060
00:48:16.063 --> 00:48:17.981
GENEVA: He was telling me
that I would go to jail.

1061
00:48:17.981 --> 00:48:19.316
and I was scared of that.

1062
00:48:19.316 --> 00:48:21.818
But then he would tell me that he loved me

1063
00:48:22.444 --> 00:48:24.821
and that he cared about me.
he didn't want anything to happen to me.

1064
00:48:24.821 --> 00:48:26.573
So. there was still. like.
a little bit of manipulation

1065
00:48:26.573 --> 00:48:28.450
and I was just. like. so confused.

1066
00:48:45.259 --> 00:48:46.969
GENEVA: The fact that he got
in the amount of trouble

1067
00:48:46.969 --> 00:48:49.805
that he did get into.
it was not my intention.

1068
00:48:50.347 --> 00:48:51.890
I just needed to get away from it.

1069
00:48:52.850 --> 00:48:54.685
BASS:
Of course. we believe him.

1070
00:48:54.685 --> 00:48:55.894
- We're family.

1071
00:48:55.894 --> 00:48:57.396
We hate to see one of our own

1072
00:48:57.396 --> 00:48:59.439
be incarcerated. you know.

1073
00:48:59.439 --> 00:49:01.191
especially for an allegation.

1074
00:49:01.191 --> 00:49:04.570
You know? And he's literally
sitting rotting in jail

1075
00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:06.488
- for an allegation--
KILO: Almost a year.

1076
00:49:06.488 --> 00:49:07.739
- That shit felt forever.

1077
00:49:07.739 --> 00:49:09.575
- Everybody was like.

1078
00:49:09.575 --> 00:49:11.910
"He was arrested
because of his girlfriend."

1079
00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:13.662
And I'm like. "Well. this is why."

1080
00:49:15.664 --> 00:49:18.876
When I told my piece about the situation.

1081
00:49:18.876 --> 00:49:20.669
fans are not very understanding

1082
00:49:20.669 --> 00:49:22.921
because obviously the person
that they look up to

1083
00:49:22.921 --> 00:49:25.841
is saying one thing. and then I was saying
the complete opposite.

1084
00:49:25.841 --> 00:49:27.885
Obviously. they're not going
to believe me.

1085
00:49:32.306 --> 00:49:34.933
FLYBOY: The fans are toxic.
so if they get an ear of things.

1086
00:49:34.933 --> 00:49:36.560
they're going to start

1087
00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:38.103
making up their own narratives

1088
00:49:38.103 --> 00:49:40.355
and start twisting things
and contorting it.

1089
00:49:40.355 --> 00:49:43.150
And so now. it's this on social media.

1090
00:49:44.151 --> 00:49:47.654
Whether he did it or not.
for people to make it public.

1091
00:49:47.654 --> 00:49:50.199
all that shit brings
attention towards him.

1092
00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:54.536
- I want to say it was.
we were on Instagram

1093
00:49:54.536 --> 00:49:56.580
and A$AP Rocky was like.

1094
00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:58.248
"Yo. free X.

1095
00:49:58.248 --> 00:49:59.958
that's the hottest nigga out
of Florida right now." right?

1096
00:49:59.958 --> 00:50:02.044
- Free my nigga XXX.

1097
00:50:02.044 --> 00:50:03.378
I can't wait 'til you come home.

1098
00:50:03.378 --> 00:50:04.713
Fuck is you talking 'bout?

1099
00:50:04.713 --> 00:50:06.590
He the hardest nigga in Florida.

1100
00:50:06.590 --> 00:50:07.841
I said it. So what--

1101
00:50:07.841 --> 00:50:09.843
- It would literally
become like a hashtag.

1102
00:50:09.843 --> 00:50:12.846
like his mug shot went viral.

1103
00:50:12.846 --> 00:50:15.557
- The first image I ever saw
of Jahseh was his mug shot.

1104
00:50:15.557 --> 00:50:19.228
and it was probably the most
polarizing image of an artist

1105
00:50:19.228 --> 00:50:21.230
that I've ever seen in my life.

1106
00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:24.816
He had tattoos on his face.
Half blond. half black hair.

1107
00:50:24.816 --> 00:50:26.818
He had the stare in his eyes.

1108
00:50:26.818 --> 00:50:28.612
His eyes almost looked black.

1109
00:50:28.612 --> 00:50:31.698
His image. it was exciting.
it was polarizing.

1110
00:50:31.698 --> 00:50:33.659
I knew that people wouldn't forget him

1111
00:50:33.659 --> 00:50:35.953
because he was the first of his kind.

1112

1117
00:50:45.379 --> 00:50:49.216
where drama and bullshit sells.

1118
00:50:49.216 --> 00:50:51.093
And so as bad as that was.

1119
00:50:51.093 --> 00:50:52.970
it helped to catapult him
to the next level

1120
00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:54.555
because his name was everywhere.

1121
00:50:54.555 --> 00:50:57.432
And then the Drake beef added to it.

1122
00:50:58.475 --> 00:51:00.394
MAN: It was the fans
who started saying something

1123
00:51:00.394 --> 00:51:01.687
about Drake stealing his flow.

1124
00:51:01.687 --> 00:51:03.230
- That's how we found out
'cause of the fans.

1125
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:05.524

were speaking out before us.

Once the fans started speaking.

1133
00:51:18.829 --> 00:51:20.163
it all started speaking for itself.

1134
00:51:21.832 --> 00:51:23.417
SOLOMON:
People were fighting about the music.

1135
00:51:23.417 --> 00:51:24.626
falling in love with the music.

1136
00:51:24.626 --> 00:51:26.420
People were fighting about the charges.

1137
00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:27.629
hating him for the charges.

1138
00:51:27.629 --> 00:51:30.757
But. like. he was only getting
more famous by the day.

1139
00:51:30.757 --> 00:51:32.801
Whether you loved it
or whether you hated it.

1140
00:51:32.801 --> 00:51:34.261

CLEOPATRA: I had labels
started reaching out to me

1151
00:51:54.656 --> 00:51:55.824
because he was locked up.

1152
00:51:55.824 --> 00:51:58.577
Regardless of whether me and him
fought like cats and dogs.

1153
00:51:58.577 --> 00:52:01.121
he knew that I always had
his best interests at heart.

1154
00:52:01.121 --> 00:52:03.624
Who was he going to trust.
you know what I mean?

1155
00:52:03.624 --> 00:52:06.668
I'm his mama.
So. he gave me power of attorney.

1156
00:52:06.668 --> 00:52:09.630
You know. I was kind of like.
"Oh. we should sign. we should sign."

1157
00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:12.508
He was like. "No. Mom. if we can
hold on and stay independent.

1158
00:52:12.508 --> 00:52:14.551
that's where the real bag is."

1159
00:52:14.551 --> 00:52:16.637
Seeing all the people
being screwed in the industry.

1160
00:52:16.637 --> 00:52:19.139
he knew very well and from early

1161
00:52:19.139 --> 00:52:22.726
that he wanted to own all his masters.

1162
00:52:23.185 --> 00:52:25.604
He knew what the end game
and the end goal was.

1163
00:52:26.772 --> 00:52:28.690
Solomon found us. actually.

1164
00:52:28.690 --> 00:52:30.442
I was intrigued by that.

1165
00:52:30.442 --> 00:52:32.945
- You know. I saw pictures
of him. of course.

1166
00:52:32.945 --> 00:52:34.780
But. like. I don't know. in my mind. like.

1167
00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:36.406
I was expecting him to be. like.

1168
00:52:36.406 --> 00:52:38.408
like a giant almost when I saw him.

1169
00:52:38.408 --> 00:52:41.370
And then when I saw him behind the glass.

1170
00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:44.414
it was just kind of crazy
because he was a kid.

1171
00:52:44.998 --> 00:52:48.126
All this craziness.
and then he's just a kid.

1172
00:52:48.126 --> 00:52:50.128
Like. he had all the hope in the world

1173
00:52:50.128 --> 00:52:52.005
and you could see he was vulnerable.

1174
00:52:52.005 --> 00:52:53.924
So. at that point. I'm just like.
"Yo. no matter what.

1175
00:52:53.924 --> 00:52:55.425
yo. I got this kid. I got him."

1176
00:52:55.425 --> 00:52:57.594
- We got our first deal
while he was locked up.

1177
00:52:58.512 --> 00:53:01.807
SOLOMON: We got the 100 grand
to license "Look at Me" to Empire.

1178
00:53:01.807 --> 00:53:03.517
and it was off to the races from there.

1179
00:53:12.359 --> 00:53:14.903
- No. I really didn't give
a fuck. to be honest.

1180
00:53:14.903 --> 00:53:16.655
That wasn't a concern to me.

1181
00:53:16.655 --> 00:53:19.533
Uh. I just knew that
the record was special.

1182
00:53:19.533 --> 00:53:21.076
It was moving.

1183
00:53:21.076 --> 00:53:24.162
and I just started chasing it.

1184
00:53:24.162 --> 00:53:26.623
I think my first contact with him was.

1185
00:53:26.623 --> 00:53:30.169
uh. Bob called me on three-way
with him in prison.

1186
00:53:30.878 --> 00:53:33.130
and we talked for a couple minutes

1187
00:53:33.130 --> 00:53:34.882
and he told me had a couple other deals

1188
00:53:34.882 --> 00:53:36.633

SOLOMON: I know a lot of fans.
a lot of people thought

1530
01:10:07.457 --> 01:10:09.543
he was going to make an album
full of "Look at Me's."

1531
01:10:09.543 --> 01:10:13.130

01:10:16.842 --> 01:10:21.305
I remember when 17 came out.
I was worried at the time

because as amazing as I thought

SOLOMON: I remember
Kendrick Lamar giving it praise.

1546
01:10:43.911 --> 01:10:46.955
So many people really.
really. really surprised

1547
01:10:46.955 --> 01:10:49.541
at how Jah just left
his soul on that project.

1548
01:10:49.541 --> 01:10:53.003
He just gave it to you.
It was raw. It was honest.

1549
01:10:53.003 --> 01:10:54.213
It was everything.

1550
01:10:54.671 --> 01:10:57.257
And also nothing like
we've ever heard before.

1551
01:11:03.931 --> 01:11:05.682
MARC:
My first article about XXXTentacion

1552
01:11:05.682 --> 01:11:07.226
was in February of 2017.

1553
01:11:07.226 --> 01:11:08.519
and he was already blowing up.

1554
01:11:09.144 --> 01:11:11.230
Around the time that X was
blowing up was the moment

1555
01:11:11.230 --> 01:11:13.565
when people were becoming more conscious

1556
01:11:13.565 --> 01:11:15.359
of what kind of values
they wanted to support.

1557
01:11:15.359 --> 01:11:18.487
It was a strange moment
for somebody to be coming up

1558
01:11:18.487 --> 01:11:21.907
who also had these terrible
allegations attached to him.

1559
01:11:34.127 --> 01:11:36.380
So. at this point. people are
listening to his music.

1560
01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:37.965
people that we respect and admire

1561
01:11:37.965 --> 01:11:40.050
are recommending his music.

1562
01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:41.385
There's more to the story.

1563
01:11:41.385 --> 01:11:43.637
Here's what this young woman
said under oath

1564
01:11:43.637 --> 01:11:44.638

1584
01:12:44.198 --> 01:12:46.783
Hashtag insensitive.

1585
01:12:47.659 --> 01:12:49.453
GHAZI SHAMI:
He had gone on social media.

1586
01:12:49.453 --> 01:12:51.914
and I think it was on his story

1587
01:12:52.497 --> 01:12:54.374
and he had a girl next to him

1588
01:12:54.374 --> 01:12:55.792
and they were laughing and giggling

1589
01:12:55.792 --> 01:12:57.127
and he made a pretty...

1590
01:12:58.337 --> 01:13:00.589
aggressive remark towards women.

1591
01:13:00.589 --> 01:13:03.592
And. um. it was pretty bad.

1592
01:13:03.592 --> 01:13:05.928
I mean. it was bad enough
that women in my office

1593
01:13:05.928 --> 01:13:07.095
were talking about it.

1594
01:13:07.095 --> 01:13:08.388
And so...

1595
01:13:09.223 --> 01:13:11.600
we all decided to jump
on the phone with him.

1596
01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:14.394
It was me. his mom...

1597
01:13:15.771 --> 01:13:18.440
Solomon.
the criminal attorney.

1598
01:13:19.191 --> 01:13:20.734
and the entertainment attorney.

1599
01:13:21.985 --> 01:13:23.654
I don't think anybody else
was on the call.

1600
01:13:23.654 --> 01:13:25.155
It was a group call.

1601
01:13:25.155 --> 01:13:28.158
And they kind of wanted to address
some of his actions.

1602
01:13:28.158 --> 01:13:30.994
And he wasn't fucking with it.

1603
01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:33.330
He was really upset.

1604
01:13:33.956 --> 01:13:35.207
Started yelling at us.

1605
01:13:35.207 --> 01:13:36.917
He was always adamant that he wanted

1606
01:13:36.917 --> 01:13:38.919
to express whatever it was
he wanted to express.

1607
01:13:38.919 --> 01:13:41.380
and he didn't give a fuck what anybody had
to think about it.

1608
01:13:42.381 --> 01:13:43.507
And so...

1609
01:13:45.008 --> 01:13:47.010
I remember we hung up the phone.

1610
01:13:47.010 --> 01:13:48.637
but I called him

1611
01:13:48.637 --> 01:13:51.348
and I was like.
"Bro. let me holler at you."

1612
01:13:51.890 --> 01:13:53.058
And he was like. "What's up?"

1613
01:13:53.976 --> 01:13:55.060
And I said to him.

1614
01:13:57.187 --> 01:13:59.439
"You know. you've spent...

1615
01:14:00.607 --> 01:14:03.777
"all this time building this relationship

1616
01:14:03.777 --> 01:14:05.821
"to your audience on social media.

1617
01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:09.700
"And I know you really love

1618
01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:11.535
"and cherish this role of the villain

1619
01:14:12.703 --> 01:14:14.663
"and the villain
has gotten you pretty far.

1620
01:14:15.622 --> 01:14:17.708
"but I don't think you need
to be the villain anymore.

1621
01:14:17.708 --> 01:14:20.169
You're already poppin'.
Just be who you are."

1622
01:14:20.711 --> 01:14:24.423
And I don't know. for whatever reason.

1623
01:14:24.423 --> 01:14:26.466
I don't know if it was that conversation.

1624
01:14:26.466 --> 01:14:28.760
I don't know if he had
other conversations with his mom

1625
01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:31.513
or his other friends
around him or whatever.

1626
01:14:31.513 --> 01:14:33.432
But I want to say that. like.

1627
01:14:33.432 --> 01:14:36.393
something definitely changed
after that incident.

1628
01:14:36.393 --> 01:14:37.978
Things started to change with him.

1630
01:14:40.022 --> 01:14:43.150

within the last couple hours.

1632
01:14:44.693 --> 01:14:46.528
Obviously. you guys know
I'm going through a lot

just. uh. due to this case.

1634
01:14:48.405 --> 01:14:50.365
If I want to assert myself

1635
01:14:50.365 --> 01:14:52.534
in my career or have my views respected.

1636
01:14:52.534 --> 01:14:55.287
I realize that I have
to treat everything with care

1637
01:14:55.287 --> 01:14:57.372
and take time
and have patience with people.

1638
01:14:57.372 --> 01:14:59.541
I just want people to know
that I'm not trying to lead

1639
01:14:59.541 --> 01:15:02.503
their children down a dark. dark path.

1640
01:15:02.503 --> 01:15:04.588
and that I really want something
good for the human race.

1641
01:15:04.588 --> 01:15:07.299
So. with that being said.
I hope everyone has a good...

1642

BASS: There's some issues
where people need to be scrutinized

1643
01:15:09.635 --> 01:15:11.094
and some issues where people just need

1644
01:15:11.094 --> 01:15:12.930
to be put away. You feel me?

1645
01:15:12.930 --> 01:15:15.057
But there are some issues
where people need help.

1646
01:15:15.057 --> 01:15:16.517
especially kids.

1647
01:15:17.017 --> 01:15:18.435
He was mature.

1648
01:15:18.435 --> 01:15:20.604
Streetwise. he was mature.

1649
01:15:20.604 --> 01:15:23.899
He was music business savvy.
You know I mean?

1650
01:15:23.899 --> 01:15:25.150
He had a lot of--

1651
01:15:25.150 --> 01:15:27.236
So. he had to have
some type of. like. hustle

1652
01:15:27.236 --> 01:15:29.446
in his family background.
you could tell that.

1653
01:15:29.446 --> 01:15:32.032
But at the end of the day.
like emotionally.

1654
01:15:32.032 --> 01:15:33.867
he wasn't. he wasn't there yet.

1655
01:15:40.499 --> 01:15:42.918
- It made me. I mean.
it made me sad. you know.

1656
01:15:42.918 --> 01:15:45.420
He allegedly did to her
what she. what he allegedly did.

1657
01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:47.923
But that doesn't mean
that he didn't suffer as well.

1658
01:15:47.923 --> 01:15:50.092
That doesn't make him just
a two-dimensional person. either.

1659

SOLOMON:
I saw him battle with his demons

1660
01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:26.461
from the very beginning.

1661
01:16:26.461 --> 01:16:28.088
I wish I could have helped more.

1662
01:16:28.088 --> 01:16:29.965
I didn't know how to help.
I didn't know what to do.

1663
01:16:30.424 --> 01:16:33.135
- It's one of those days where you realize
nothing fucking matters.

1664
01:16:35.804 --> 01:16:38.015
One of those days where you feel
like driving off a bridge.

1665
01:16:40.642 --> 01:16:42.269
Am I really quitting? Yes. I'm quitting.

1666
01:16:43.061 --> 01:16:44.396
I don't know for how long.

But I'm just not going
to make music right now.

that my mind's been fucked up.

01:16:51.028 --> 01:16:52.863
My mind has been somewhere else.

1670
01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:57.868
SOLOMON: He saw a doctor
and was diagnosed as bipolar.

1671
01:16:58.619 --> 01:17:00.579
They were giving him medicine to take.

1672
01:17:00.579 --> 01:17:02.748
You know. he hated
the medicine. of course.

1673
01:17:02.748 --> 01:17:07.002
The medicine made him dull. uncreative.

1674
01:17:07.002 --> 01:17:09.755
It was hard for him to be himself.

1675
01:17:09.755 --> 01:17:11.381
- What are they going to say now?

1676
01:17:12.841 --> 01:17:14.468
Isn't it clear I don't give a fuck?

1677
01:17:15.427 --> 01:17:17.638
CLEOPATRA:
He made himself ugly at one point

1678
01:17:17.638 --> 01:17:19.890
by shaving off his eyebrows.
that's what he called it.

1679
01:17:19.890 --> 01:17:21.850
shedding who he was.

1680
01:17:21.850 --> 01:17:24.394
JAHSEH: If you feel
as if your physical identity

1681
01:17:24.394 --> 01:17:26.813
has to be the same as everyone else's

1682
01:17:26.813 --> 01:17:29.066
to be socially acceptable. you're stupid.

1683
01:17:29.858 --> 01:17:31.360
Be yourself.

1684
01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:33.028
COOLIECUT:
He wanted to trip acid.

1685
01:17:33.779 --> 01:17:35.405
I think he was kind of trying
to free his mind

1686
01:17:35.405 --> 01:17:37.032
from everything that was going on.

1687
01:17:37.616 --> 01:17:40.035
But it was kind of
to dig deeper into yourself

1688
01:17:40.035 --> 01:17:42.079
to understand like.
"Why you think like this?

1689
01:17:42.079 --> 01:17:43.664
Why do you act like that?"

1690
01:17:43.664 --> 01:17:46.333
He wanted to shed his skin.
He kept saying it to me.

1691
01:17:46.333 --> 01:17:48.168
He was like.
"Bro. I feel like I don't like this.

1692
01:17:48.168 --> 01:17:49.920
You feel me? The skin I'm in."

1693
01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:51.421
He just meant like he wanted to become

1694
01:17:51.421 --> 01:17:53.006
a better person. you know what I mean?

1695
01:17:53.006 --> 01:17:54.550
He just kept saying that over and over.

1696
01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:55.926
I was like. "Yeah. I feel you. bro.

1697
01:17:55.926 --> 01:17:57.177
"We're going to get through this.

1698
01:17:57.177 --> 01:17:58.929
"You're going to become
a better person. bro. Don't worry."

♪ The way I feel now ♪

1701
01:18:09.314 --> 01:18:12.067
JOHN: He was going through a lot
and we would be making songs

1702
01:18:12.067 --> 01:18:14.069
and sometimes in between the process.

1703
01:18:14.069 --> 01:18:16.864
I would kind of leave my phone
on just forgetting about it.

1704
01:18:16.864 --> 01:18:19.283
and then we would start
talking about something.

1705
01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:21.493
This is one.

1717
01:20:22.239 --> 01:20:23.699
- Okay. guys. so basically.

1718
01:20:23.699 --> 01:20:25.909
this is what I wanted to explain today.

1719
01:20:25.909 --> 01:20:27.995
um. just based off of what I've learned.

1720
01:20:28.412 --> 01:20:31.665
You have to take a second to sit down
to thoroughly observe your patterns.

1721
01:20:31.665 --> 01:20:33.709
Do you move when you don't want to move?

1722
01:20:33.709 --> 01:20:36.253
Do you get angry
when you don't want to get angry?

1723
01:20:36.253 --> 01:20:37.796
You have to fix
these things about yourself.

1724
01:20:37.796 --> 01:20:39.673
You have to give a fuck about yourself.

1725
01:20:39.673 --> 01:20:41.592
And that makes life so much better.

1726
01:20:41.592 --> 01:20:43.302
Like. I'm learning to do it now.

1727
01:20:43.302 --> 01:20:45.762
And it makes life 10 times better.

1728
01:20:45.762 --> 01:20:46.889
It makes you feel better.

1729
01:20:47.264 --> 01:20:49.016
I want you to start a journal.

1730
01:20:49.892 --> 01:20:52.352
COOLIECUT: That's when
the internal change was happening.

1731
01:20:52.352 --> 01:20:54.104
He was actually changing internally.

1732
01:20:54.104 --> 01:20:55.814
trying to preach a positive message

1733
01:20:55.814 --> 01:20:58.650
because he kind of had a negative impact.

1734
01:20:58.650 --> 01:20:59.943
And he wanted to balance that out.

1735
01:20:59.943 --> 01:21:02.070
JAHSEH: I'm going to stop
calling you guys fans.

1736
01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:04.615
I'm going to start calling you
members of my cult.

1737
01:21:05.032 --> 01:21:07.242
This is a cult. Not a fan base.

1738
01:21:07.242 --> 01:21:10.579
While we have this big family
of a fan base

1739
01:21:10.579 --> 01:21:12.164
and there's a lot of us
that are depressed.

1740
01:21:12.164 --> 01:21:14.499
myself. including myself.

1741
01:21:14.499 --> 01:21:15.626
There's a lot of us that are depressed.

1742
01:21:15.626 --> 01:21:17.586
so just hashtag my name

1743
01:21:17.586 --> 01:21:20.214
and find another person
that listens to my music

1744
01:21:20.214 --> 01:21:21.673
and help them through their problems.

1745
01:21:21.673 --> 01:21:23.967
So. here's what we'll do.
we'll start a hashtag today.

1746
01:21:23.967 --> 01:21:25.928
Um. I want you to get this trending.

1747
01:21:25.928 --> 01:21:29.264
Hashtag #Youtellmeyourproblems
andI'lltellyoumine.

1748
01:21:29.264 --> 01:21:31.642
and we will use this hashtag
to communicate

1749
01:21:31.642 --> 01:21:33.977
with other fr-- uh. fans and friends.

1750
01:21:33.977 --> 01:21:36.480
uh. and that listen to my music.
that need help.

1751
01:21:36.897 --> 01:21:40.317
- He did not want that image
to follow him around

1752
01:21:40.317 --> 01:21:41.485
for the rest of his life.

1753
01:21:42.361 --> 01:21:44.488
But when it comes
to his relationship with Geneva.

1754
01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:46.990
I do sincerely think that he wanted

1755
01:21:46.990 --> 01:21:49.451
to fix his relationship
with her privately.

1756
01:21:49.451 --> 01:21:53.163
But between the law.
the case. and then the public.

1757
01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:56.041
it. that was like an impossible task.

1758
01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:58.502
- He had what's called

1759
01:21:58.502 --> 01:22:00.879
a no contest order of protection

1760
01:22:00.879 --> 01:22:02.881
against. uh. Geneva.

1761
01:22:03.966 --> 01:22:07.344
- ♪ Under the assumption
love is dead. already ♪

1762
01:22:08.679 --> 01:22:10.597
♪ Just let me be here ♪

1763
01:22:12.266 --> 01:22:15.561
One of the girls that he was living with.
she hit me up on Instagram.

1764
01:22:15.561 --> 01:22:17.271
she told me that Jahseh wanted
to speak to me.

1765
01:22:18.146 --> 01:22:20.649
And I was like. "What?"

1766
01:22:22.067 --> 01:22:24.236
And I was speaking to him.
I was on FaceTime with him.

1767
01:22:24.236 --> 01:22:26.738
and he was telling me
that he wanted to meet up

1768
01:22:26.738 --> 01:22:28.490
and apologize to me.

1769
01:22:28.490 --> 01:22:29.992
And I was really scared
because I didn't know

1770
01:22:29.992 --> 01:22:31.243
if it was a setup.

1771
01:22:31.243 --> 01:22:32.995
I was. like. still very afraid of him.

1772
01:22:33.453 --> 01:22:34.580
So. I was scared.

1773
01:22:35.622 --> 01:22:38.417
But I just had to. like. overcome that.

1774
01:22:38.417 --> 01:22:42.087
I felt like I had to face my problems.

1775
01:22:43.130 --> 01:22:46.717
- Reporting live from Florida.
with the alleged hurricane...

1776
01:22:46.717 --> 01:22:48.343
GENEVA:
We'd. like. hang out here and there.

1777
01:22:48.343 --> 01:22:50.762
I spent a whole weekend with him

1778
01:22:50.762 --> 01:22:53.807
during a hurricane
and like. nobody even knew.

1779
01:22:53.807 --> 01:22:56.185
People online would be like.
they hate each other.

1780
01:22:56.602 --> 01:22:58.353
But in reality. like. we were talking.

1781
01:22:59.771 --> 01:23:03.817
For me. like. I found sympathy
and empathy in the situation.

1782
01:23:03.817 --> 01:23:06.904
and I was able to literally
just. like. forgive him

1783
01:23:06.904 --> 01:23:08.697
because I feel like...

1784
01:23:08.697 --> 01:23:10.574
I basically compared it to my mother.

1785
01:23:10.574 --> 01:23:12.576
Like. my mother has abused me.

1786
01:23:12.576 --> 01:23:15.037
And you don't see people

1787
01:23:15.037 --> 01:23:16.788
disowning their mother because of that--

1788
01:23:16.788 --> 01:23:20.417
Well. you do. but not
necessarily in every instance.

1789
01:23:26.423 --> 01:23:28.842
JOHN: They both had an opinion
on what should happen.

1790
01:23:28.842 --> 01:23:32.054
But at some point. the state
of Florida wanted otherwise.

1791
01:23:34.723 --> 01:23:37.768
SOLOMON:
When Geneva sends in her affidavit

1792
01:23:37.768 --> 01:23:40.812
to say she no longer wanted

1793
01:23:40.812 --> 01:23:43.232
to pursue criminal charges.

1794
01:23:43.232 --> 01:23:47.277
I think that prompted them
to go through the jail calls.

1795
01:23:47.277 --> 01:23:49.613
You know. there was
so much stuff on there.

1796
01:23:49.613 --> 01:23:51.657
they easily charged Jahseh

1797
01:23:51.657 --> 01:23:54.743
with a bunch of new counts
of witness tampering.

1798
01:23:56.203 --> 01:23:59.373
- Okay. guys. so I was
just given seven more charges.

1799
01:23:59.373 --> 01:24:01.333
uh. by the state attorney's office.

1800
01:24:01.333 --> 01:24:03.877
uh. and I have a court date on the 15th.

1801
01:24:04.294 --> 01:24:07.631
So. I would ask that everyone
come to support me.

1802
01:24:08.090 --> 01:24:11.927
I ask that the people that do come
come bearing positive energy.

1803
01:24:12.386 --> 01:24:14.388
JOHN:
He had this court date in December.

1804
01:24:14.888 --> 01:24:16.682
The day before. I was asking him. like.

1805
01:24:16.682 --> 01:24:19.351
"What's the worst thing
that can happen tomorrow?"

1806
01:24:19.351 --> 01:24:21.812
He answered that he'd be
taken in for a couple hours

1807
01:24:21.812 --> 01:24:24.398
and they'd be able to get him out
that same day.

1808
01:24:24.398 --> 01:24:27.651
- The fans took over
the. the whole courthouse.

1809
01:24:27.651 --> 01:24:29.444
They were calling the judge.

1810
01:24:29.444 --> 01:24:31.488
like doing all kinds of crazy stuff.

1811
01:24:31.488 --> 01:24:32.781
Soon as you walk into the room.

1812
01:24:32.781 --> 01:24:35.325
you could feel the energy from the judge.

1813
01:24:35.325 --> 01:24:37.953
He didn't even get a chance to say a word.

1814
01:24:37.953 --> 01:24:39.788
She just started going in.

1815
01:24:50.215 --> 01:24:51.675
DEANDRA: It seemed like
she just knew in her mind

1816
01:24:51.675 --> 01:24:54.052
she was going to take him that day
to make an example of.

1817
01:24:54.052 --> 01:24:55.721
you don't have more power than we do.

1818
01:24:57.055 --> 01:24:59.183
SOLOMON: They ended up
taking him in for a week.

1819
01:25:00.559 --> 01:25:02.394
CLEOPATRA:
All those charges added up.

1820
01:25:02.394 --> 01:25:04.938
So. I believe he was looking at 20 years.

1821
01:25:04.938 --> 01:25:06.607
Now because of his status.

1822
01:25:06.607 --> 01:25:10.110
it requires him to be
segregated in solitary.

1823
01:25:10.694 --> 01:25:12.696
Not being in general population.

1824
01:25:12.696 --> 01:25:14.114
he doesn't have access

1825
01:25:14.114 --> 01:25:15.782
to sitting and talking to people

1826
01:25:15.782 --> 01:25:17.993
or anything that can stimulate him.

1827
01:25:17.993 --> 01:25:20.954
And he already struggled
with hearing voices in his head

1828
01:25:20.954 --> 01:25:22.539
and being alone.

1829
01:25:22.539 --> 01:25:26.210
Any time in. you know.
locked up in solitary

1830
01:25:26.752 --> 01:25:28.462
would be a problem for him.

1831
01:25:28.462 --> 01:25:29.505
And we knew that.

1832
01:25:39.473 --> 01:25:41.642
DEANDRA: It doesn't matter
how many times he spoke

1833
01:25:41.642 --> 01:25:43.977
about. like. helping each other
or something like that.

1834
01:25:43.977 --> 01:25:46.021
it was always. okay. but he beat Geneva.

1835
01:25:47.898 --> 01:25:51.068
Like. he can never have a conversation

1836
01:25:51.068 --> 01:25:52.694
without that being.

1837
01:25:53.195 --> 01:25:54.655
going back to being the topic.

1838
01:25:58.075 --> 01:25:59.409
- Why is it wrong?

1839
01:25:59.409 --> 01:26:00.869
- How do you fully redeem yourself

1840
01:26:00.869 --> 01:26:03.163
if every time on every corner

1841
01:26:03.664 --> 01:26:05.249
it just keeps popping up?

1842
01:26:12.047 --> 01:26:15.300
- He acknowledged that he was.
that there was a situation.

1843
01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:18.011
you know. but self-acknowledgment
and accountability.

1844
01:26:18.011 --> 01:26:20.556
do I have to hold myself accountable

1845
01:26:20.556 --> 01:26:22.391
and admit it to the world

1846
01:26:22.391 --> 01:26:24.142
just for you guys to judge me anyways?

1847
01:26:25.602 --> 01:26:27.729
They were going to judge him
no matter what.

1848
01:26:27.729 --> 01:26:29.648
You know. without knowing the full story.

1849
01:26:29.648 --> 01:26:31.817
It didn't matter if he spoke
that full story.

1850
01:26:31.817 --> 01:26:34.027
they were going to judge him
no matter what.

1851
01:26:34.027 --> 01:26:35.904
And that's all he had.
that's all he was going through.

1852
01:26:35.904 --> 01:26:37.197
was being judged.

1853
01:26:37.197 --> 01:26:38.574
He could release a number one album.

1854
01:26:38.574 --> 01:26:39.825
You could love his song.

1855
01:26:39.825 --> 01:26:41.285
But then they were still judging him

1856
01:26:41.910 --> 01:26:43.120
based on that situation.

1857
01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:45.205
It wasn't something he was able to escape.

1858
01:26:45.205 --> 01:26:46.957
even though he was
holding himself accountable.

1859
01:26:51.044 --> 01:26:53.255
- I think it also might have
resulted in them taking

1860
01:26:53.255 --> 01:26:55.048
- his whole life away.
CLEOPATRA: Yeah.

1861
01:26:55.048 --> 01:26:57.176
- I think. I think it makes sense that

1862
01:26:57.176 --> 01:26:59.261
that's an apology that needs to be

1863
01:26:59.261 --> 01:27:01.680
kind of more. um. planned out

1864
01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:05.142
in a way that. like. has
an actual beneficial result

1865
01:27:05.142 --> 01:27:06.852
and not one that. you know.

their entire freedom

1867
01:27:09.354 --> 01:27:10.647
and life taken away.

1868
01:27:11.982 --> 01:27:14.443
- But I do think he would have
gotten to a place where he would have

1869
01:27:15.527 --> 01:27:18.530
gotten there. it just.
he just never had a chance to.

1870
01:27:41.887 --> 01:27:44.681
GUY WHEELER: I got a call
from a well-known psychologist

1871
01:27:44.681 --> 01:27:47.267
by the name of Dr. Michael Brannon.

1872
01:27:47.267 --> 01:27:50.854
The judge decided that
I was going to work with him.

1873
01:27:50.854 --> 01:27:52.272
The judge pointed at me. he says.

1874
01:27:52.272 --> 01:27:54.149
"Everywhere he go.
he's got to go. you got to go.

1875
01:27:54.149 --> 01:27:56.318
He can't go anywhere without you."

1876
01:27:56.777 --> 01:28:00.656
Well. the first day. it was.
it was people here galore.

1877
01:28:01.031 --> 01:28:02.658
I didn't want to go right then and there

1878
01:28:02.658 --> 01:28:04.409
in a sit-down face-to-face.

1879
01:28:04.409 --> 01:28:06.870
because from a cultural
kind of background.

1880
01:28:06.870 --> 01:28:08.830
the connotations of therapy

1881
01:28:08.830 --> 01:28:11.583
and counseling perception is
what goes along with that.

1882
01:28:11.583 --> 01:28:13.460
"I'm crazy. I'm loco and I ain't crazy."

1883
01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:15.128
As a matter of fact.
he mentioned that. you know.

1884
01:28:15.128 --> 01:28:16.547
"Ain't nothing wrong with me.
I ain't crazy."

1885
01:28:16.547 --> 01:28:18.841
I said. "Man. let's walk.
let's just walk."

1886
01:28:18.841 --> 01:28:20.843
"Man. I got problems like anybody else."

1887
01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:22.719
I said. "Look. I'm here. man.

1888
01:28:23.470 --> 01:28:25.389
"you know. to treat you
like a human being.

1889
01:28:25.389 --> 01:28:27.933
"It's about your life. man.
That's a bigger picture to me.

1890
01:28:27.933 --> 01:28:29.434
I'm concerned about you."

1891
01:28:29.434 --> 01:28:30.853
And he looked like that.

1892
01:28:31.854 --> 01:28:33.522
pointed at me. he's like. "Straight."

1893
01:28:33.522 --> 01:28:34.898

Guy was rule-based.

He was like. "Yo. you got
to clean this shit up.

"Something bad is going to happen.
Yo. you know what?

1899
01:28:45.450 --> 01:28:46.952
"You can't have
all these women in your house.

1900
01:28:46.952 --> 01:28:48.203
"That's going to lead to something.

1901
01:28:48.203 --> 01:28:50.122
You just pick one and call it a day."

1902
01:28:50.831 --> 01:28:52.165
You know. he picked Jen.

JENESIS SANCHEZ:
Before me and Jah ever dated.

1904
01:28:56.336 --> 01:28:57.588
we were not two people

1905
01:28:57.588 --> 01:28:59.673
that were looking for anything at all.

1906
01:28:59.673 --> 01:29:01.466
He actually wanted me to be his assistant.

1907
01:29:02.050 --> 01:29:03.552
Jah always saw me

1908
01:29:03.552 --> 01:29:06.471
as this very nurturing. caring person.

1909
01:29:07.014 --> 01:29:09.516
and he felt very safe when he was with me

1910
01:29:09.516 --> 01:29:11.018
and I did. too.

1911
01:29:11.018 --> 01:29:13.562
So. he just kind of said. like.

01:29:13.562 --> 01:29:15.272
"You're my girlfriend now.

1913
01:29:15.272 --> 01:29:17.566

1915
01:29:20.319 --> 01:29:21.778

1916
01:29:21.778 --> 01:29:24.114
I'm like... "Okay."

1917
01:29:24.114 --> 01:29:26.158
I could be your rock. you could be mine.

1918
01:29:28.035 --> 01:29:30.704
I will say. there were
some days I felt like

1919
01:29:30.704 --> 01:29:33.916
I was definitely walking
on shards of glass.

1920
01:29:33.916 --> 01:29:36.502
because you didn't know
what you were going to get.

1921
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:40.631
GUY: We would have sessions.
we would just sit down and talk and laugh.

1922
01:29:40.631 --> 01:29:42.925
Whatever his pain or whatever
he was going through.

1923
01:29:42.925 --> 01:29:44.384
whatever he wanted to talk to me about.

1924
01:29:44.384 --> 01:29:46.053
personal. family kind of stuff.

1925
01:29:46.053 --> 01:29:48.138
And I recognized then that this was

1926
01:29:48.138 --> 01:29:50.766
a traumatized human being
unable to grieve.

1927
01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:53.143
And he had to play out the macho.

1928
01:29:53.143 --> 01:29:55.270
He's five-foot-two.
he's going to play out this macho.

1929
01:29:55.270 --> 01:29:57.856
the rap and hip-hop
and all of that.

1930
01:29:57.856 --> 01:30:00.025
And he's dealing with
an enormous amount of emotion

1931
01:30:00.025 --> 01:30:01.109
and a lot of stuff.

1932
01:30:01.109 --> 01:30:02.778
I never can be his biological father.

1933
01:30:02.778 --> 01:30:04.154
and that was not my role.

1934
01:30:04.154 --> 01:30:06.365
But if anything. that I can be there

1935
01:30:06.365 --> 01:30:08.492
and that I didn't want money from him.

1936
01:30:08.492 --> 01:30:10.202
it was about him

1937
01:30:10.202 --> 01:30:13.455
just as a human being

1938
01:30:13.455 --> 01:30:16.208

making music with him.

that's when he was happy.

I realized that. like.
the process of making music

and being able to put
his mind on something

1946
01:30:43.986 --> 01:30:45.737
was what allowed him to free his mind

1960
01:31:25.611 --> 01:31:27.404

And so we decided to knock out the closets

1962
01:31:29.615 --> 01:31:31.783
and build a studio in home for him.

I remember. like. there was a day

1966
01:31:37.748 --> 01:31:39.541
in early January that

1967
01:31:39.541 --> 01:31:41.418
he was asking me if I had any beats.

1968
01:31:41.418 --> 01:31:43.378

and he said. "No. you."

1971
01:31:48.050 --> 01:31:50.260

01:31:50.260 --> 01:31:52.804

2032
01:34:28.544 --> 01:34:30.045
is creation and evolution.

2033
01:34:30.462 --> 01:34:34.383
It's better to be respected
through love rather than fear

2034
01:34:34.383 --> 01:34:37.219
simply because. like. all right.
I was respected through fear

2035
01:34:37.219 --> 01:34:38.512
and it's not real love.

2036
01:34:38.512 --> 01:34:41.056
It's not real love.
and it drives people away.

2037
01:34:41.056 --> 01:34:42.432
It makes people treat you differently.

2038
01:34:42.432 --> 01:34:44.518
It makes people really. like--

2039
01:34:45.269 --> 01:34:46.562
It's just not genuine.

2040
01:34:46.562 --> 01:34:48.522
It's not what you really would want.

2041
01:34:49.439 --> 01:34:51.900
It's better not to be
a crazy motherfucker.

2042
01:34:51.900 --> 01:34:53.861
It's better not. 'Cause I've. I've--

2043
01:34:53.861 --> 01:34:56.154
I've been-- I've went through that.
I've decided I want--

2044
01:34:56.154 --> 01:34:57.865
There was a point where
I wanted to be the villain.

2045
01:34:57.865 --> 01:34:59.867
and it's not fun. bro. It's not fun.

2046
01:34:59.867 --> 01:35:02.369
People t--
Like. it doesn't attract anything

2047
01:35:02.369 --> 01:35:03.662
that you truly want.

2048
01:35:03.662 --> 01:35:05.789
I've started to look at myself
very differently

2049
01:35:05.789 --> 01:35:07.457
and beat myself up.

2050
01:35:07.457 --> 01:35:09.918
And you guys are the only thing
that gives me hope.

2051
01:35:09.918 --> 01:35:11.712
You guys are the only things that.

2052
01:35:11.712 --> 01:35:13.255
that thing that motivates me

2053
01:35:13.255 --> 01:35:15.841
to ideally like. yo. be strong.

2054
01:35:15.841 --> 01:35:20.512
You have over eight million kids or adults

2055
01:35:20.512 --> 01:35:22.556
and teenagers watching you

2056
01:35:23.348 --> 01:35:24.725
relying on you for this hope.

2057
01:35:26.852 --> 01:35:28.854
DEANDRA:
Jahseh was becoming more patient.

2058
01:35:28.854 --> 01:35:32.566
He was more positive versus
being so angry all the time.

2059
01:35:32.566 --> 01:35:34.943
You can reason with him

2060
01:35:34.943 --> 01:35:37.487
because he was able
to reason with himself.

2061
01:35:37.487 --> 01:35:40.490
- When the nigga would just
usually freak out and trip out.

2062
01:35:40.490 --> 01:35:41.909
you would see him go into a corner

2063
01:35:41.909 --> 01:35:43.827
and do breathing exercises. you feel me?

2064
01:35:43.827 --> 01:35:45.287
Keep his eyes closed. meditate.

2065
01:35:45.287 --> 01:35:47.206
even if it's for. like.
a little 10 minutes.

2066
01:35:47.206 --> 01:35:49.291
then come back and address the situation.

2067
01:35:56.673 --> 01:35:58.967
JENESIS:
One day I get home. and I'm like.

2068
01:35:58.967 --> 01:36:01.595
something. something doesn't feel right.

2069
01:36:01.595 --> 01:36:04.056
The next day. I took a pregnancy test

2070
01:36:04.056 --> 01:36:06.600
and sure enough.
I find out that I'm pregnant.

2071
01:36:07.309 --> 01:36:10.395
Jah had. like. 30 phones.
it was so ridiculous.

2072
01:36:10.395 --> 01:36:12.940
So. I'm. like. sending
the picture to all these phones

2073
01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:14.316
because I couldn't get ahold of him.

2074
01:36:14.316 --> 01:36:16.026
Turns out he was at the gym training.

2075
01:36:16.026 --> 01:36:17.861
Finally. when I got ahold of Jah.

2076
01:36:17.861 --> 01:36:19.071
he was super excited.

2077
01:36:19.071 --> 01:36:21.114
Like. he was like. "No way."

2078
01:36:21.532 --> 01:36:23.742
- Family and success.

2079
01:36:24.117 --> 01:36:26.787
[all cheering]
WOMAN: Cheers.

2080
01:36:29.748 --> 01:36:32.042
- I almost felt like he knew
how to relate to kids

2081
01:36:32.042 --> 01:36:34.461
more than he did other people.

2082
01:36:37.548 --> 01:36:41.969
And he saw this emotional
phenomenon in children

2083
01:36:41.969 --> 01:36:45.097
that they were pure and unable to judge

2084
01:36:45.097 --> 01:36:47.891
and unable to have hatred in their heart.

2085
01:36:47.891 --> 01:36:49.518
And he loved that so much

2086
01:36:49.518 --> 01:36:52.187
that the idea of having a kid of his own

2087
01:36:52.187 --> 01:36:55.816
and being able to instill
this sense of acceptance

2088
01:36:55.816 --> 01:36:59.194
and lovingness and positivity
within this kid

2089
01:37:00.487 --> 01:37:02.114
would have been his proudest moment.

2090
01:37:07.494 --> 01:37:10.873
GHAZI: I know one incident.
I had took him to Nobu.

2091
01:37:10.873 --> 01:37:13.333
It was his first time
eating at a fancy restaurant.

2092
01:37:13.834 --> 01:37:15.002
And they pulled up

2093
01:37:15.961 --> 01:37:17.379
and we were sitting down eating.

2094
01:37:17.379 --> 01:37:19.423
and he was fucking around
with the chopsticks

2095
01:37:19.423 --> 01:37:21.008
and we were just sitting there

2096
01:37:21.008 --> 01:37:22.885
and we started talking about kids.

2097
01:37:22.885 --> 01:37:25.762
He was like. "You're going
to be a great dad."

2098
01:37:25.762 --> 01:37:28.223
I said. "You're going to be
a great dad too someday. bro."

2099
01:37:28.223 --> 01:37:30.851
He said. "No. I'm not."
I said. "What do you mean?"

2100
01:37:31.435 --> 01:37:33.312
And he just looked me dead
in the eye and he was like.

2101
01:37:33.312 --> 01:37:34.688
"I'm not gonna make it past 21."

2102
01:37:34.688 --> 01:37:36.815
And then just went right back
to fuckin' with the chopsticks.

2103
01:37:37.399 --> 01:37:38.859
like he hadn't said a thing.

2104
01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:44.656
CLEOPATRA:
He always spoke about death

2105
01:37:44.656 --> 01:37:45.741
and was fascinated with it.

2106
01:37:45.741 --> 01:37:48.535
I think. since he was about 15.

2107
01:37:49.077 --> 01:37:51.747
It's almost as if he was preparing me

2108
01:37:51.747 --> 01:37:53.207
that he wasn't going to be here.

2109
01:37:55.959 --> 01:37:58.962
His lawyers called and told me that. um.

2110
01:37:59.546 --> 01:38:02.382
they were coming to pick Jah up Tuesday.

2111
01:38:11.975 --> 01:38:15.395
I had the worst anxiety ever.

2112
01:38:15.896 --> 01:38:18.899
[loud hip-hop music playing]

2113
01:38:24.196 --> 01:38:27.741
I went to the studio
and he was working on his first beat.

2114
01:38:29.368 --> 01:38:30.744
And he was so proud.

2115
01:38:31.912 --> 01:38:33.163
[sniffles]

2116
01:38:33.163 --> 01:38:34.456
[exhales]

2117
01:38:34.456 --> 01:38:35.999
And I was so proud because I was like.

2118
01:38:35.999 --> 01:38:37.459
"Yo. where did you come from?

2119
01:38:37.459 --> 01:38:39.920
How did you even learn
to do these things. you know?"

2120
01:38:42.381 --> 01:38:44.716
He spoke about possibly running.

2121
01:38:45.509 --> 01:38:47.052
And I was like.
"Jah. where are you going to go?

2122
01:38:47.845 --> 01:38:50.597
"You have blue hair with tats
all over your face.

2123
01:38:51.098 --> 01:38:54.601
You're not exactly going
to blend in with the crowd."

2124
01:38:54.601 --> 01:38:56.645
And. um. he was like.

2125
01:38:56.645 --> 01:39:00.399
"I can't. I don't understand
what's happening or why."

2126
01:39:00.399 --> 01:39:02.734
And I said. "Kid. you're powerful."

2127
01:39:03.402 --> 01:39:07.781
I said. "I've watched you
control your crowd and your audience."

2128
01:39:07.781 --> 01:39:10.325
I said. "That's. that's dangerous

2129
01:39:11.118 --> 01:39:12.244
to the status quo."

2130
01:39:12.244 --> 01:39:14.997
He got up from around the table
and he said. um.

2131
01:39:16.748 --> 01:39:18.917
"To whom much is given. much is required."

2132
01:39:20.294 --> 01:39:22.880
And then he said. "You know.
I'm going to go buy a bike."

2133
01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:24.464
And I was like. "What? Why?"

2134
01:39:25.174 --> 01:39:27.593
Because at the time. he had
about three bikes in the garage

2135
01:39:27.593 --> 01:39:29.928
and then some other ones
at his other house

2136
01:39:29.928 --> 01:39:31.930
that he doesn't even ride them.

2137
01:39:31.930 --> 01:39:34.558
But I knew my son. I knew it was
because he was so worried.

2138
01:39:34.558 --> 01:39:35.809
He was so scared.

2139
01:39:35.809 --> 01:39:36.977
Typically. I'd be. like.

2140
01:39:37.603 --> 01:39:40.689
arguing with him
about those type of things.

2141
01:39:40.689 --> 01:39:43.942
if it doesn't make sense.
but I knew what that was.

2142
01:39:43.942 --> 01:39:46.945
And so I was like. "Okay. let me
get security together for you."

2143
01:39:46.945 --> 01:39:49.740
And he was like. "Nah.
they're going to take too long."

2144
01:39:49.740 --> 01:39:52.951
I called Jazz's brother.
which is Aiden's dad.

2145
01:39:52.951 --> 01:39:55.787
I called him and I was like. "Hey. um.

2146
01:39:55.787 --> 01:39:57.664
"Jah wants to go pick up this bike.

2147
01:39:57.664 --> 01:39:59.333
"I'm gonna need you to drive his car back

2148
01:39:59.333 --> 01:40:02.544
in the event that he.
he does. um. get the bike."

2149
01:40:02.961 --> 01:40:06.590
And I said. "No matter what he says.
don't leave his side."

01:41:54.573 --> 01:41:56.450
I think X got shot!

2200
01:41:57.367 --> 01:41:58.702
- I'm like. "They did what?

2201
01:41:59.328 --> 01:42:00.787
Wait. what do you mean they shot Jahseh?"

2202
01:42:01.288 --> 01:42:03.123
- I remember not having any gas.

2203
01:42:03.624 --> 01:42:05.000
not wanting to stop.

2204
01:42:06.376 --> 01:42:09.171
I'm trying to get to where he was.

2205
01:42:09.171 --> 01:42:12.049
and. um. it's all a blur.

2206
01:42:12.049 --> 01:42:13.800
- And I just remember. like. calling Cleo.

2207
01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:15.761
Like. "Cleo. where are you?"
She's like. "I'm lost."

2208
01:42:15.761 --> 01:42:17.804
She. like. literally didn't know
where she was.

2209
01:42:17.804 --> 01:42:20.140
I'm like. "Bro. you got
to get to the hospital."

2210
01:42:20.140 --> 01:42:21.975
She's like. "I'm trying
to get there. but I-- "

2211
01:42:21.975 --> 01:42:23.435
She's like. "I don't know where I'm at."

2212
01:42:23.435 --> 01:42:24.436
[sniffles]

2213
01:42:26.021 --> 01:42:27.940
- I was like disoriented.

2214
01:42:27.940 --> 01:42:30.317
I got there. there was
a few people there already.

2215
01:42:30.317 --> 01:42:31.944
I'm not sure how they found out.

2216
01:42:31.944 --> 01:42:34.071
And I was just in there from then on.

2217
01:42:34.071 --> 01:42:35.781
pacing back and forth.

2218
01:42:35.781 --> 01:42:38.116
I wasn't able to go back there.

2219
01:42:38.116 --> 01:42:39.493
and they gave me some bullshit story

2220
01:42:39.493 --> 01:42:41.828
about them not wanting me
to see him like that

2221
01:42:41.828 --> 01:42:43.789
because it would traumatize me.

2222
01:42:43.789 --> 01:42:46.583
But I think that I should have
made that decision

2223
01:42:46.583 --> 01:42:48.377
of seeing my son.

2224
01:42:49.086 --> 01:42:51.380
- And then it's like that calm.

2225
01:42:51.380 --> 01:42:53.131
Just. there was like a calm that set in.

2226
01:42:53.131 --> 01:42:54.216
because it's like. "All right.

2227
01:42:54.842 --> 01:42:57.052
"It's Jahseh. like. he's a fighter.

2228
01:42:59.346 --> 01:43:01.098
"He's a fighter.
Jahseh is going to make it through.

2229
01:43:01.098 --> 01:43:02.766
If anybody was going to make it through.
it was going to be him."

2230
01:43:04.142 --> 01:43:07.521
- The cops came out.
and they pulled me in a room

2231
01:43:07.521 --> 01:43:09.857
and I remember

2232
01:43:09.857 --> 01:43:12.568
the officer was just so callous

2233
01:43:12.568 --> 01:43:14.236
when he delivered.

2234
01:43:14.236 --> 01:43:16.989
He was just like.
"Oh. Jahseh expired today

2235
01:43:16.989 --> 01:43:18.365
at such and such time."

2236
01:43:19.867 --> 01:43:23.412
- I still don't understand.
what do you mean by expired?

2237
01:43:30.544 --> 01:43:32.254
- That shit just seem like

2238
01:43:32.963 --> 01:43:36.091
watching a movie or something.

2239
01:43:36.091 --> 01:43:39.469
It's. I-I don't know. I never get.

2240
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:42.806
come to terms with it.

2241
01:43:45.517 --> 01:43:47.728
- It went from that to just...

2242
01:43:50.647 --> 01:43:51.940
planning a funeral.

2243
01:43:52.733 --> 01:43:54.151
I remember Cleo walking
in the room and saying.

2244
01:43:54.151 --> 01:43:56.111
"How do we plan a funeral?

2245
01:44:00.157 --> 01:44:02.284

That's not a toy.

2262
01:45:45.095 --> 01:45:47.806
CLEOPATRA: His son isn't old enough
to carry on his legacy.

2263
01:45:48.307 --> 01:45:50.142
There's nobody that can do it.

2264
01:45:50.142 --> 01:45:53.645
So I have to not only be here

2265
01:45:53.645 --> 01:45:55.772
for my other son.

2266
01:45:55.772 --> 01:45:58.317
I have to be here to maintain his legacy

2267
01:45:58.317 --> 01:46:01.028
as well as look after my grandson.

2268
01:46:04.406 --> 01:46:06.700
Jah was my practice baby.

2269
01:46:07.284 --> 01:46:08.660
I was 17 years old.

2270
01:46:08.660 --> 01:46:11.288
There was nobody teaching me
how to take care of a child.

2271
01:46:11.288 --> 01:46:13.457
I just had to kind of figure it out.

2272
01:46:14.875 --> 01:46:18.337
Jah kind of changed
my mindset from hammering.

2273
01:46:18.337 --> 01:46:19.880
"You're going to do this.
you're going to do that."

2274
01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:22.216
because you lose your child doing that.

2275
01:46:23.091 --> 01:46:25.219
You have to allow them to be themselves.

2276
01:46:29.056 --> 01:46:31.099
- How are you?
- Good.

2277
01:46:34.353 --> 01:46:36.063
GENEVA:
After Jahseh died.

2278
01:46:36.063 --> 01:46:39.024
Cleo reached out to me.
like. a year later.

2279
01:46:40.025 --> 01:46:41.568
So. she calls me.

2280
01:46:41.568 --> 01:46:44.029
and before I answer the phone.
I'm like. "Oh my god."

2281
01:46:44.029 --> 01:46:45.906
Like. "I don't know if this
is gonna be bad or good."

2282
01:46:45.906 --> 01:46:48.867
I was. like. alleviated
but really nervous.

2283
01:46:49.493 --> 01:46:52.412
CLEOPATRA: You know. this is.
my son's no longer here.

2284
01:46:52.412 --> 01:46:55.457
and I feel like it's up to me now

2285
01:46:55.457 --> 01:46:58.585
to make amends for any mistakes
that he's done

2286
01:46:58.585 --> 01:47:01.547
and try to right his wrongs
as much as I can.

2287
01:47:01.547 --> 01:47:03.882
I would actually like
to hear you tell your story

2288
01:47:03.882 --> 01:47:05.425
because like I said. my son died

2289
01:47:05.425 --> 01:47:08.220
and I. he's never admitted it to me.

2290
01:47:08.220 --> 01:47:10.514
I don't think he would want me
to see him in that light

2291
01:47:10.514 --> 01:47:14.226
or know those things. that side of him.

2292
01:47:14.852 --> 01:47:16.436
You know. Jahseh...

2293
01:47:20.357 --> 01:47:23.068
was wrong for what he did.

2294
01:47:24.486 --> 01:47:28.282
You know. um. there's no excuse
for that. period.

2295
01:47:28.991 --> 01:47:30.701
You know? But. um...

2296
01:47:32.578 --> 01:47:34.872
I just want the world to know that

2297
01:47:36.081 --> 01:47:38.208
he wasn't that same person anymore

2298
01:47:38.208 --> 01:47:41.837
and that whether it's the past.
it's still a part of his story.

2299
01:47:46.133 --> 01:47:48.552
GENEVA:
Now. Cleo and I are cool.

2300
01:47:49.094 --> 01:47:52.139
It makes me feel like
a weight is lifted basically.

2301
01:47:53.140 --> 01:47:55.934
Because I felt like I wasn't accepted

2302
01:47:55.934 --> 01:47:57.769
by the whole family the whole time.

2303
01:47:59.521 --> 01:48:00.647
[sniffles]

2304
01:48:04.484 --> 01:48:07.237
CLEOPATRA: I'm not going to hate her
and my son's not here.

2305
01:48:07.237 --> 01:48:09.865
and I don't think she should
be mistreated in any way.

2306
01:48:09.865 --> 01:48:12.951
This is about his legacy.
and she is the love of his life.

2307
01:48:12.951 --> 01:48:15.120
and she was a part of that legacy.

2308
01:48:19.708 --> 01:48:21.585
GENEVA:
People have. like. asked me for advice.

2309
01:48:21.585 --> 01:48:24.087
and I just feel bad sometimes
'cause. like.

2310
01:48:24.087 --> 01:48:28.133
I don't know how I feel
about telling other people

2311
01:48:28.133 --> 01:48:30.010
what to do or. like.
how to feel about that

2312
01:48:30.010 --> 01:48:31.595
because I feel like it's just different

2313
01:48:31.595 --> 01:48:32.971
with every person.

2314
01:48:35.807 --> 01:48:37.768
SKI:
It's crazy to think that really and truly

2315
01:48:37.768 --> 01:48:39.811
that the end of the story
to Jahseh's legacy

2316
01:48:39.811 --> 01:48:42.439
is going to really help
so many fucking lives.

2317
01:48:45.275 --> 01:48:48.237
So hard to explain. but this
dude turned everything around

2318
01:48:48.237 --> 01:48:49.738
for the better.

2319
01:48:52.157 --> 01:48:54.785
GUY: He set out a parachute
with his name on it.

2320
01:48:55.494 --> 01:48:58.080
I think he wanted to talk about suicide

2321
01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:00.874
and those types of things
to help somebody.

2322
01:49:01.750 --> 01:49:03.252
Really. he wanted to save somebody.

2323
01:49:11.426 --> 01:49:13.095
SKI:
It could go a lot of ways for me.

2324
01:49:13.095 --> 01:49:15.681
but I just know that I have
to make Jahseh proud.

2325
01:49:15.681 --> 01:49:16.890
I have to.

2326
01:49:16.890 --> 01:49:18.308
Because I know I'm going to see him again

2327
01:49:18.308 --> 01:49:20.102
in some cosmic plan.

2328
01:49:20.102 --> 01:49:21.770
Some cosmic plan. I'm gonna see Jah again.

2329
01:49:21.770 --> 01:49:23.856
and that's what I live
my life based off of.

01:51:03.247 --> 01:51:04.206
that I'm feeling.

2366
01:51:06.416 --> 01:51:07.918
- I looked at him as a mentor.

2367
01:51:07.918 --> 01:51:10.963
I would hit him up for advice
in high school.

2368
01:51:10.963 --> 01:51:14.091
Like. I would hit him up for advice

2369
01:51:14.091 --> 01:51:15.634
if I was going through something.

2370
01:51:15.634 --> 01:51:18.303
and it. he was always there.

2371
01:51:18.303 --> 01:51:20.013
Literally. he was always there.

2372
01:51:22.349 --> 01:51:23.851
- Everybody wants to be
acknowledged. you know.

2373
01:51:23.851 --> 01:51:26.270
And. you know. you get
the occasional thank you

2374
01:51:26.270 --> 01:51:27.896
for the deal and nice whatever. whatever.

2375
01:51:27.896 --> 01:51:30.190
But. you know. our first deal

2376
01:51:30.190 --> 01:51:33.193
which was a seven-figure deal.
he called me up and said.

2377
01:51:33.193 --> 01:51:35.237
"Thank you. you're the reason
my life has changed."

2378
01:51:35.237 --> 01:51:38.824
I'm like. "Okay. that's kind of cool.

2379
01:51:38.824 --> 01:51:40.200
No one's ever said that before."

2380
01:51:45.205 --> 01:51:47.708
- My favorite memory of Jahseh...

2381
01:51:49.501 --> 01:51:52.087
was when it was me.

2382
01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:57.050
my homie VINNY CHANGO$. Ski. and Jah.

2383
01:51:57.050 --> 01:52:00.053
and. like. we played
his music on the radio

2384
01:52:00.053 --> 01:52:01.972
and. like. he. like...

2385
01:52:02.848 --> 01:52:04.850
stood up in the middle of a car.

2386
01:52:04.850 --> 01:52:07.102
like. put his. like. ear mad close

2387
01:52:07.102 --> 01:52:08.395
to. like. to the speaker and was like.

2388
01:52:08.395 --> 01:52:09.897
"Yo. is this me?"

2389
01:52:10.397 --> 01:52:12.024
Like. "Is this me right now?"

2390
01:52:12.024 --> 01:52:13.775
And I'm like. "Bro. this is you."

2391
01:52:13.775 --> 01:52:15.736
And then for. like.
literally the rest of the night.

2392
01:52:15.736 --> 01:52:17.237
I kid you not.

2393
01:52:17.237 --> 01:52:19.990
he just screamed. "This is me!

2394
01:52:19.990 --> 01:52:21.450
"This is me!

2395
01:52:21.450 --> 01:52:22.826
This is me!" For the whole night.

2396
01:52:25.037 --> 01:52:28.207
- So. he's in the studio
doing his thing. I hit record.

2397
01:52:29.708 --> 01:52:31.668
He didn't know I hit record.

2398
01:52:31.668 --> 01:52:34.213
So. I hit record and he's doing
his little thing.

2399
01:52:34.213 --> 01:52:35.756
doing his little thing.

2400
01:52:35.756 --> 01:52:37.549
So. he's like. "All right. I'm ready now."

2401
01:52:37.549 --> 01:52:39.426
So. I just start playing back
what he just did.

2402
01:52:39.426 --> 01:52:41.720
He was like.
"What. what. what. you was recording?"

2403
01:52:41.720 --> 01:52:43.514
I'm like. "Yeah." He was like. "Shit.

2404
01:52:43.514 --> 01:52:45.557
I like this shit. Keep playing it."

2405
01:52:45.557 --> 01:52:46.642
I was like. "All right."

2406
01:52:49.186 --> 01:52:51.730
- He never turned this into a song.
but it was always one of those moments

2407
01:52:51.730 --> 01:52:53.440
that kind of stuck with me.

2408
01:52:57.694 --> 01:53:00.864
