347
00:18:53.915 --> 00:18:57.179
- Well. who drives a sports car
in weather like this?

348
00:18:57.266 --> 00:18:59.007
- Uh. it's my only car.

349
00:18:59.094 --> 00:19:01.836
and it wasn't like this
when I set out.

350
00:19:01.923 --> 00:19:04.534
- Set out to?

351
00:19:04.621 --> 00:19:06.188
Hey. I don't mean to pry.

352
00:19:06.275 --> 00:19:08.364
You know.
if it's a big secret--

353
00:19:08.408 --> 00:19:10.888
- It's not a secret.

354
00:19:10.932 --> 00:19:14.849
I was setting out to. um.
uh. um. check on a friend

355
00:19:14.892 --> 00:19:16.720
because she's so sick.

356
00:19:16.764 --> 00:19:21.377
and no one can check on her
at the moment but me.

357
00:19:21.464 --> 00:19:24.380
- Mm.

358
00:19:24.467 --> 00:19:27.427
So you decided just to
chow down some pancakes first?

359
00:19:27.514 --> 00:19:30.473
- Well. I spoke to him. and--

360
00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.433
- Her.
You said "her."

361
00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.564
- Yeah. I just said that.
"I spoke to her."

362
00:19:34.608 --> 00:19:35.696
- Mm-hmm.

363
00:19:35.783 --> 00:19:37.263
- And she was fine
this morning.

364
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:40.222
so I didn't wanna drive
on an empty stomach.

365
00:19:40.309 --> 00:19:42.224
so I ordered pancakes.

366
00:19:45.271 --> 00:19:47.403
- Blood sugar levels.
lightheadedness.

367
00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:51.233
- Oh. yeah. of course.

368
00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.843
- Why are you grinning?
It's a real thing.

369
00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:54.541
- Whoa. I know.

370
00:19:54.628 --> 00:19:55.890
Oh. that's why I can't skip
any meals.

371
00:19:55.977 --> 00:19:58.022
Yeah.

372
00:19:58.066 --> 00:19:59.198
You know. I checked the roads.

373
00:19:59.285 --> 00:20:00.895
and they haven't
cleared 'em yet.

374
00:20:00.982 --> 00:20:02.157
so we're gonna be here
for a while.

375
00:20:02.244 --> 00:20:04.072
so we might as well
get comfortable.

376
00:20:05.508 --> 00:20:07.858
Oh.

377
00:20:07.945 --> 00:20:10.252
Hey. I gotta take this
outside real quick.

378
00:20:10.339 --> 00:20:14.430
You know. can you. um--can you
order me another bagel?

379
00:20:14.517 --> 00:20:17.303
'Cause...

380
00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:19.609

Thanks.

382

Here. just keep the change.

I wanted to discuss the sale

Now. I realize that you have
two offers

what I intended

455
00:24:01.875 --> 00:24:05.139
for the property.
it might help you decide.

456
00:24:05.226 --> 00:24:07.489
- And what is that?

457
00:24:07.533 --> 00:24:12.059
- I want to open
a year-round Christmas store.

458
00:24:12.146 --> 00:24:13.669
- Is that right?
- Yes.

459
00:24:13.756 --> 00:24:15.366
I've done my research.

460
00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:17.368
and year-round Christmas stores
do very well.

461
00:24:17.412 --> 00:24:19.153

00:24:29.729 --> 00:24:32.209
I love Christmas.
I really do.

465
00:24:32.296 --> 00:24:34.516
The homeowners' association
decorates the outside

466
00:24:34.603 --> 00:24:36.170

and it's nice.

467

476
00:25:01.804 --> 00:25:03.327

- Pretty good chocolatier.
are you. son?

478

definitely my specialty.

a decision right away.

on my mind right now.

487
00:25:34.097 --> 00:25:36.709
- Okay.

488
00:25:36.796 --> 00:25:39.407
I just came back
from a breakfast meeting

489
00:25:39.494 --> 00:25:42.236
of the Main Street
Merchants Association.

490
00:25:42.323 --> 00:25:45.805
Now. every year. we have
a decorating contest--

491
00:25:45.892 --> 00:25:49.112
a battle. actually. between
the Main Streets of our town

492
00:25:49.199 --> 00:25:50.766
here in Castle Creek

493
00:25:50.853 --> 00:25:53.682
and our neighboring town
of Crystal.

494
00:25:53.769 --> 00:25:56.642
- Well. that sounds like fun.
- Well. yes.

495
00:25:56.729 --> 00:25:58.426
it's supposed to be.

496
00:25:58.513 --> 00:26:00.515
but a lot of people
forget the fun.

497
00:26:00.602 --> 00:26:02.778
and they let their egos
get in the way.

498
00:26:02.865 --> 00:26:05.085
which is probably why
we've lost this contest

499
00:26:05.172 --> 00:26:07.435
for the last five years
running.

500
00:26:07.478 --> 00:26:09.219
and my Tina and I.

501
00:26:09.306 --> 00:26:12.179

every year.

502
00:26:12.266 --> 00:26:14.137

anybody down this year.

503

- I can help you.

505
00:26:25.018 --> 00:26:26.497
- I couldn't ask you
to do that.

506
00:26:26.541 --> 00:26:29.109
- Are you kidding?
Christmas is my life.

507
00:26:29.196 --> 00:26:30.545
My parents are traveling.

508
00:26:30.632 --> 00:26:31.938

till after the New Year.

509
00:26:32.025 --> 00:26:33.330
and my roommate is flying home
to see her family.

510
00:26:33.417 --> 00:26:36.159
so basically. I'm free.

511
00:26:36.246 --> 00:26:39.249
I'll get a room in town.
I would love to help you.

512
00:26:41.774 --> 00:26:45.255
- It's a lot of work.
- I don't mind work.

513
00:26:45.342 --> 00:26:46.996
- Neither do I.
I wanna help too.

514
00:26:47.083 --> 00:26:49.129
- That's really not necessary.
- It'll be my pleasure.

515
00:26:49.216 --> 00:26:50.609
My parents are in Seattle
for Christmas.

516
00:26:50.696 --> 00:26:52.349
so I have all the time
in the world

517
00:26:52.436 --> 00:26:53.829

00:35:25.949 --> 00:35:27.690
You know. why don't you two go
just head into the living room.

691
00:35:27.777 --> 00:35:30.693
and I'll bring out the cocoa
and the cake?

692
00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:32.695
- I could get really used
to this.

693
00:35:32.782 --> 00:35:34.132
- Hmm.

694
00:35:42.662 --> 00:35:49.059
<i>♪ ♪</i>

695
00:35:51.801 --> 00:35:55.109
Well. you have certainly
brought the spirit of Christmas

696
00:35:55.196 --> 00:35:56.676
into my home.

697
00:35:56.719 --> 00:36:00.158
Tina would love
what you've done.

698
00:36:00.245 --> 00:36:05.511
I have not seen this
in years. not years.

699
00:36:05.598 --> 00:36:08.514
You see. we would rotate
the decorations

700
00:36:08.557 --> 00:36:11.430
from year to year so it
would always be different.

701
00:36:11.517 --> 00:36:15.434
- That's why I had so many
boxes to choose from.

702
00:36:15.521 --> 00:36:19.046
I came across a big box
that belonged to a Marjorie.

703
00:36:19.133 --> 00:36:20.308
and by came across.

704
00:36:20.395 --> 00:36:21.657
I'd accidentally
knocked it over.

705
00:36:21.744 --> 00:36:22.963
but don't worry;
I didn't break anything.

706
00:36:25.922 --> 00:36:27.620
Are you okay?
Did I bring up something--

707
00:36:27.707 --> 00:36:29.317
- No. no. no. it's okay.
It's okay.

708
00:36:29.404 --> 00:36:32.581
You did a lovely thing here.
just lovely.

709
00:36:32.625 --> 00:36:36.455
- Here we go.
- Oh. my.

710
00:36:36.542 --> 00:36:38.370
- Yeah. here.

711
00:36:38.457 --> 00:36:41.068
- I'll tell you. if your cake
tastes as good as it smells.

712
00:36:41.155 --> 00:36:44.680
young man. your shop is gonna
do a lot better than just okay.

713
00:36:44.767 --> 00:36:46.900
- Well. thank you. sir.

714
00:36:46.987 --> 00:36:49.207
- And a candy cane
in the cocoa.

715
00:36:49.294 --> 00:36:51.121
that's a nice touch.

716
00:36:51.165 --> 00:36:54.995
- Well. a hint of mint
never hurts.

717
00:36:55.082 --> 00:36:57.867
- And your magic touch.
young lady.

718
00:36:57.954 --> 00:37:00.435
is gonna make your shop
a thing to behold.

719
00:37:00.522 --> 00:37:03.525
- That's very kind. Elder.

720
00:37:03.612 --> 00:37:04.874
- Let's see.

721
00:37:07.921 --> 00:37:10.445
Fantastic.

722
00:37:10.532 --> 00:37:12.055
Mmm!

724
00:37:18.671 --> 00:37:20.499
- Oh. still a little sore.
but at least it's not broken.

725
00:37:20.586 --> 00:37:21.848
Thanks for asking.

726
00:37:21.935 --> 00:37:23.328
- Well. that's good.

727
00:37:23.415 --> 00:37:24.851
Just making sure
you don't have any excuse

728
00:37:24.938 --> 00:37:26.548
not to pull
your chairpeople duties.

729
00:37:26.635 --> 00:37:29.029
- For a second. I thought
I recognized compassion.

730
00:37:29.116 --> 00:37:30.683
- Yeah. that too.

731
00:37:34.208 --> 00:37:35.601

733
00:37:38.125 --> 00:37:39.648
- Good morning.
- Morning.

734
00:37:39.735 --> 00:37:42.825
- Looking for anything
in particular today?

735
00:37:42.869 --> 00:37:45.393
- You. actually.
- Oh?

736
00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.352
- Yeah. Elder Dubois said
that we might be stopping by.

737
00:37:47.439 --> 00:37:50.093
- Oh. yes.
Oh. of course.

738
00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:53.488
Um. Amelia and Vic.
nice to meet you.

739
00:37:53.575 --> 00:37:56.274
- Likewise--we just thought
we'd introduce ourselves

740
00:37:56.361 --> 00:37:57.449
to the individual merchants

741
00:37:57.536 --> 00:37:58.667
before we set up
a group meeting.

742
00:37:58.754 --> 00:38:00.365
- Yeah. put together
a game plan

743
00:38:00.452 --> 00:38:01.888
for the Battle
of the Main Streets.

744
00:38:01.975 --> 00:38:03.542
You have any ideas this year?

745
00:38:03.629 --> 00:38:06.849
Winter Wonderland.

746
00:38:06.936 --> 00:38:09.025
We decorate the front
of our shops.

747
00:38:09.112 --> 00:38:12.028
One shop is chosen
to host the judges.

748
00:38:12.115 --> 00:38:15.641
and we contribute to the host
store to make it extra special.

749
00:38:15.728 --> 00:38:18.426
- Hmm.
- So just same every year?

750
00:38:18.513 --> 00:38:20.689
- It's just easiest that way.

751
00:38:20.776 --> 00:38:23.736
- Elder said there might be
some challenging personalities?

752
00:38:23.823 --> 00:38:25.303
- Understatement.

753
00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:26.913
Oh. I tease.

754
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.002
but. uh. let me know
what the others say.

755
00:38:29.045 --> 00:38:31.961
Rowena Marston
of the Pottery House

756
00:38:32.048 --> 00:38:34.268
is never shy with her opinion.

757
00:38:34.355 --> 00:38:37.706
Make sure you give her a call.

758
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:40.274
- Thank you.
- Okay. thank you.

759
00:38:40.361 --> 00:38:42.755
- You're very welcome.
Come on by soon.

760
00:38:42.842 --> 00:38:45.410
- You bet.
We'll be back.

761
00:38:50.763 --> 00:38:52.721
- That wasn't weird.

762
00:38:52.808 --> 00:38:55.681
Sounds like that Rowena at
the Pottery House is trouble.

763
00:38:55.768 --> 00:38:57.639
- What do you think
we got ourselves into?

764
00:38:57.726 --> 00:38:58.858
- Let's check it out.

765
00:39:01.643 --> 00:39:04.951
- So what were you gonna do
if this didn't work out?

766
00:39:05.038 --> 00:39:06.866
- Eggnog and unlimited
Christmas movies?

767
00:39:06.953 --> 00:39:08.650
- Alone?

768
00:39:08.737 --> 00:39:10.609
Some might say you got
a great personality.

769
00:39:10.652 --> 00:39:13.960
and I think you'd want to spend
Christmas with someone special.

770
00:39:14.047 --> 00:39:17.442
- So some might say I have
a great personality?

771
00:39:17.529 --> 00:39:19.792
- Great-ish...

772
00:39:19.879 --> 00:39:23.622
when you're not slamming doors
in people's faces.

773
00:39:23.709 --> 00:39:25.406
You know. too personal.

774
00:39:25.493 --> 00:39:27.408
Sorry.

775
00:39:27.495 --> 00:39:29.279
- It's fine.

776
00:39:29.367 --> 00:39:30.890
Look. I was seeing someone.

777
00:39:30.933 --> 00:39:32.152
and we ended it
a couple months ago.

778
00:39:32.239 --> 00:39:33.632
Just wasn't working out.
- Hmm.

779
00:39:33.719 --> 00:39:35.547
- Why are you free
for the holidays?

780
00:39:35.634 --> 00:39:36.983
Guys who know their way
around a kitchen like you

781
00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:38.419
are usually in high demand.

782
00:39:38.506 --> 00:39:40.682
- Maybe. but it's impossible
when you work

783
00:39:40.769 --> 00:39:41.988
two full-time jobs.

784
00:39:42.075 --> 00:39:43.816
Plus. I already took off time

785
00:39:43.903 --> 00:39:45.687
in hopes
of closing on the building.

786
00:39:45.774 --> 00:39:47.646
- Two full-time jobs?

787
00:39:47.733 --> 00:39:50.562
How long you been doing that?
- A while.

788
00:39:50.649 --> 00:39:53.347
I invest everything back
in the chocolate business.

789
00:39:53.434 --> 00:39:55.262
- That is some serious
dedication to a dream.

790
00:39:57.046 --> 00:39:58.352
I admire that.

791
00:39:58.439 --> 00:40:00.528

we wouldn't win anything

it's Jimmy Fallon or anything.

- All righty. then.

837
00:42:43.691 --> 00:42:47.173
As you guys know.
Elder has asked me and Vic

838
00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:48.566
to step in as cochairs

839
00:42:48.653 --> 00:42:50.655
of the Battle of Main Streets
contest.

840
00:42:50.698 --> 00:42:53.571
- And we know each year. one
of your stores is highlighted

841
00:42:53.614 --> 00:42:55.790
as part of
the Winter Wonderland theme.

842
00:42:55.877 --> 00:42:59.402
- It's my turn this year.
- Is it?

843
00:42:59.489 --> 00:43:02.492
Um. well. Vic and I
were thinking that maybe--

844
00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:04.103
- Were you?

845
00:43:04.146 --> 00:43:06.671
About how to play up
my pottery shop?

846
00:43:06.758 --> 00:43:08.411
You might have consulted me

847
00:43:08.498 --> 00:43:10.109
before you started
thinking.

848
00:43:10.196 --> 00:43:12.981
- Uh. I think what Amelia
was trying to say

849
00:43:13.068 --> 00:43:16.202
is that maybe this year.
we shake things up.

850
00:43:16.289 --> 00:43:18.204
Huh?
- Whoa. whoa. whoa.

851
00:43:18.247 --> 00:43:22.034
I have waited five years for my
turn in the contest spotlight.

852
00:43:22.077 --> 00:43:25.515
so if your "big idea" involves
anything other than that.

853
00:43:25.603 --> 00:43:28.083
I suggest you return
to the drawing board.

854
00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:29.650
- Seriously. Rowena?

855
00:43:29.694 --> 00:43:30.651
Why don't you
just let them speak?

856
00:43:30.738 --> 00:43:31.957
- I'm letting them speak.

857
00:43:32.044 --> 00:43:33.306
- It's not always about you.

858
00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:34.873
- You need to stop this
right now.

859
00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.526
- I'm perfectly calm.
- This is ridiculous.

860
00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:37.789
- Okay. guys.
- What are you talking about?

861
00:43:37.876 --> 00:43:38.659
Why is everyone
ganging up on me?

862
00:43:38.746 --> 00:43:40.530
- Guys?
Guys!

00:53:39.694 --> 00:53:42.306

you guys with an egg casserole.

1039
00:53:42.349 --> 00:53:44.395
but those recipes
are way more difficult

1040
00:53:44.438 --> 00:53:45.961

have escaped me.

1045
00:53:58.626 --> 00:54:00.585
- Okay. so an egg casserole
is out of the question.

What about. uh--in the mood
for pancakes?

1047
00:54:02.848 --> 00:54:05.329

- All right.

1048

Hey. can you check
those cabinets

00:54:06.765 --> 00:54:07.940

What's this for?

1052

- We're not just
making pancakes.

1053

We are making Nana's famous
Christmas ornament pancakes.

1054

pretty amazing.

1056
00:54:28.743 --> 00:54:30.179

1058

to open a bakery.

1063

1064

"celebrate"?

the Winter Wonderland theme

1146
00:59:12.505 --> 00:59:13.724
because it gives each of you
an opportunity

1147

1148
00:59:15.508 --> 00:59:17.379

we think it's only right.

1170

not to mention we want you
to escort the judges.

1171
01:00:18.919 --> 01:00:23.881
- So the cameras would begin
and end at my shop?

1172
01:00:23.924 --> 01:00:26.971
And I would be with the judges
for the whole entire time?

1173
01:00:28.494 --> 01:00:31.453
