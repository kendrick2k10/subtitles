(soft music)

75
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.008
Hey. hey buddy?

Do you want something?

77
00:04:23.371 --> 00:04:24.204
- [Charlie] You're not feeling good?

78

(object clatters)

91
00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.340
You could probably use a water too.

92
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.550
- [Charlie] That's probably smart.

93
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:54.940

94
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.300

- Ain't gonna let me go to sleep?

96
00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.265
- [Charlie] Sleep is just
practice for death. man.

97
00:05:01.265 --> 00:05:03.283
(cupboard door creaks)
don't embrace your weakness.

98
00:05:06.411 --> 00:05:08.393
(clatters utensils) Come on. wake up!

99
00:05:08.393 --> 00:05:09.930

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.410
- [Charlie] For proper hydration.

101
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.610
- [Ed] Charlie.

102
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.100
- [Charlie] Rage against
a dying inebriation.

103
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.570
- What are you saying?

104
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.160
- [Charlie] Don't sober
up. it's the worst.

105
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.160
- [Ed] You never sober up.

106
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.470
- [Charlie] Well. if you're always drunk.

107
00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.420
then you're never hung over.

108
00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.516
I mean. that's just science. you know?

109
00:05:28.516 --> 00:05:30.246
(drink splashing)
(utensils clattering)

110
00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:32.663

00:05:43.434 --> 00:05:44.518
(Charlie groans)

113
00:05:44.518 --> 00:05:45.600
- What is that?

114
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.540
- [Charlie] Well. I
need to keep you awake.

115
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.380
So. this is obviously
an energy based drink.

116
00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.030
but the problem is. is that
I didn't have enough vodka.

117
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.323
so I added a little bit more.
but then I added too much.

118
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.500
so I added a little bit more caffeine.

119
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.840
But I think now. this is
the proper proportion.

120
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.693
but anyways. you might wanna
drink this up real fast.

121
00:06:05.693 --> 00:06:07.550
to get the best results.

122
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.453
- Oh no. it's not gonna happen.

123
00:06:09.453 --> 00:06:10.470
- [Charlie] Come on man.

124
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:15.470
You're heartbroken and I promised
I'd help you feel better.

125
00:06:17.031 --> 00:06:19.140
- Mh mh.
- [Charlie] Heartbroken.

126
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:23.370
not heartbroken. sad. happy.

127
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.083
sober and drunk.

128
00:06:27.205 --> 00:06:28.676
You see the connection?

129
00:06:28.676 --> 00:06:29.990
I'll make you feel better. come on.

130
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.865
(Ed groans)

131
00:06:30.865 --> 00:06:32.934
I'm serious.
(Ed groans)

132
00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:34.630
No. seriously. (indistinct).
- Okay. all right. stop.

133
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.118
- [Charlie] Take that
hangover away. come on.

134
00:06:36.118 --> 00:06:36.951
- (whispers) Fuck.

135
00:06:36.951 --> 00:06:38.501
- [Charlie] Do not fall asleep on me.

136
00:06:38.501 --> 00:06:43.501
- I don't wanna.
(Charlie gulps)

137
00:06:47.367 --> 00:06:50.534

(insects chirping)

139
00:06:56.614 --> 00:07:00.957
- (exclaims) Touchdown!
(Ed and Charlie groan)

140
00:07:00.957 --> 00:07:01.943
Get off me!

141
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.909
- Don't be a sore loser man. (screams)

142
00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:09.869
(groans) Fuck you man.

143
00:07:09.869 --> 00:07:10.858

Fuck you.

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:14.600
(Ed and Charlie gasp)
Holy. sh...

146
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.341
That was close.

147
00:07:16.341 --> 00:07:19.174
(soft rock music)

148
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.893
- Yeah. sorry mom. do you need a refill?

149
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.900
- Yeah. you know it's pretty fucked up

150

I'm not in the mood. I'm not in the...

156
00:07:37.782 --> 00:07:40.320
(Ed and Charlie laugh)
(shield and blade clatter)

157
00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:45.320
- Off squire. you shall
not take me off the path.

158
00:07:45.436 --> 00:07:46.269
- (gasping) You're gonna kill yourself.

159
00:07:46.269 --> 00:07:47.414
- I'm on my quest!

160
00:07:47.414 --> 00:07:49.113

gonna kill yourself.

161
00:07:49.113 --> 00:07:54.113

Squire. I have the medicine
and knowledge to heal myself.

168
00:08:09.565 --> 00:08:11.500
- You're gonna need stitches.

169

(utensils clatter)

177
00:08:43.192 --> 00:08:44.414
(Ed groans)

178
00:08:44.414 --> 00:08:48.569
(Ed speaks indistinctly)

179
00:08:48.569 --> 00:08:50.448
(door clatters)

180
00:08:50.448 --> 00:08:53.073
(Charlie whistling)
(utensils clattering)

181
00:08:53.073 --> 00:08:57.665
(egg sizzling)
(utensils clattering)

182
00:08:57.665 --> 00:08:59.588
(Ed groans)

183
00:08:59.588 --> 00:09:01.078
(Ed coughs)

184
00:09:01.078 --> 00:09:02.457
- [Charlie] How are you
doing in there. buddy?

185
00:09:02.457 --> 00:09:04.790
(Ed coughs)

186
00:09:06.892 --> 00:09:08.983
Oh shit! (sings)
(utensils clatter)

187
00:09:08.983 --> 00:09:13.983
(fire crackling)
(utensils clatter)

188
00:09:16.004 --> 00:09:20.754
(Ed groans)
(soft music)

189
00:09:25.863 --> 00:09:28.450
(Ed coughs)
(Ed groans)

190
00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:33.450
(feet tread)
(door knocks)

191
00:09:34.137 --> 00:09:38.290
(fire extinguisher fizzles)
(Ed speaks indistinctly)

192
00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:40.396
No one's home. please leave a message.

193
00:09:40.396 --> 00:09:42.176
(fire extinguisher fizzles)
(door knocks)

194
00:09:42.176 --> 00:09:44.829
(birds chirping)
(groans) goddamnit.

195
00:09:44.829 --> 00:09:46.892
(utensils clatter)
(glass shatters)

196
00:09:46.892 --> 00:09:48.836
(soft music)

197
00:09:48.836 --> 00:09:49.669
(door clatters)

198
00:09:49.669 --> 00:09:52.090
- [Duncan] Hey Charlie.
pleasure to see you again.

199
00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:54.824
- [Charlie] Oh. I don't
remember an appointment.

200
00:09:54.824 --> 00:09:56.280
- Probably because we
don't have one. excuse me.

201
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.750
- [Charlie] No. oh.
oh. yeah. yeah. just...

202
00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.460
- Excuse me.
- (giggling) What you doing?

203
00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:02.810
You can't just come to my house...

204
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:04.490
Sit down. take a seat.

205
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:07.380
- I wish I could say. I was shocked to see

206
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.670
you still live under the
illusion that this is your house.

207
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.003
- 'Cause it is my house.

208
00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:14.850
- Your mother made her wishes very clear.

209
00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:16.670
it's no longer your house.

210
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:18.520
and you're gonna have to vacate soon.

211
00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:21.990
- My mother didn't know
her head from her bosom.

212
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:23.530
so...(chuckles)

213
00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:26.060
- Unfortunately. the
court disagrees with you.

214
00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.610
we need to go over a few items.

215
00:10:29.618 --> 00:10:33.163
- [Ed] (groans) Charlie.
what did I eat last night?

216
00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:35.223
Duncan?

217
00:10:35.223 --> 00:10:38.880
Hi. I did not know you were coming over.

218
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.383
- Yeah. good to see you again.

219
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.650
- Gimme one minute please.
(feet tread)

220
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:49.050
- So what are you doing here?

221
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:51.010
- It's been eight months
since your mother passed.

222
00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:53.880
time's up. you need to
get on with your life.

223
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.100
- Yeah. she delayed her
death by like 200 years.

224
00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.760
and you only giving me eight months?

225
00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.252
- You need to watch your mouth.

226
00:11:00.252 --> 00:11:02.000
That woman suffered because
of her love for you.

227
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.250
- Oh yeah. believe me.

228
00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:05.920
I know. she told me every single day.

229
00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:06.980
- And I'm telling you.

230
00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:10.600
you need to take contents in
his house. which you still own

231
00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.280
and self evict.

232
00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.202
It's on the market and
realtors will be here soon.

233
00:11:15.202 --> 00:11:17.240
- (chuckles) She can't
sell off my inheritance.

234
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.006
I mean. it's Christmas. or it was.

235
00:11:20.006 --> 00:11:22.800
- (sighs) I know you're
having trouble with this.

236
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.100
- Yes. you're damn right.

237
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.700
because she lived 20 years too long

238
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.210
and then she screws me
out of my inheritance.

239
00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:32.103
- She was trying to help you.
(Charlie chuckles)

240
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:40.073
- This is a judgment. you
understand what that means?

241
00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:43.497
- No.
(paper rustling)

242
00:11:43.497 --> 00:11:45.460
can you bring me up to speed professor?

243
00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:49.880
'Cause I left my J.D in
my other pant's pockets.

244
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.493
So. I'm gonna need you
to explain that to me.

245
00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.590
- Remember the judge?

246
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:59.700
She was the one in the black
robe. she gave me this.

247
00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.780
It says. Charles. that's you.

248
00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:05.253
needs to go bye bye. you get a check.

249
00:12:06.728 --> 00:12:10.547
- Yep. yep. yep. yep. yep.
(paper rustling)

250
00:12:10.547 --> 00:12:12.797
I don't have time for this.

251
00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.807
- [Ed] You leaving already?

252
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:18.653
- I'm getting a headache in here.

253
00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:23.811
- Yeah. we had a bit of
a good time last night.

254
00:12:23.811 --> 00:12:27.640
- Mhm.
(birds chirping)

255
00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:28.683
- Walk me to my car?

256
00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:35.010
- Yeah. go for a little
track. have fun. have a blast.

257
00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:37.540
Talk about whatever you want
to. share your feelings.

258
00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:38.720
everything. it'd be great.

259
00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:43.720
- Relax. relax.
(birds chirping)

260
00:12:44.714 --> 00:12:47.737
(door slams)

261
00:12:47.737 --> 00:12:50.154
(feet tread)

262
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.597
- [Ed] So. what brings you out here?

263
00:12:53.597 --> 00:12:56.265
(birds chirping)

264
00:12:56.265 --> 00:12:58.472
- The smell in there
classifies as a health hazard.

265
00:12:58.472 --> 00:13:01.520
- (sighs) I didn't notice.
I've been in there all day.

266
00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.963
- Ed?
- What's wrong?

267
00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.290
- Charlie hasn't responded
to any of my phone calls.

268
00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:09.450
texts. emails. letters.

269
00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:10.810
- Well. what's going on?

270
00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:13.840
- His mother didn't leave him
the house. she left it to AA

271
00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:17.700
and because they're selling
it. he needs to get out.

272
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.010
- Oh.
- By last month.

273
00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:23.340
And if anybody from my firm
saw the place like this.

274
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:24.610
Charlie'd be thousands of dollars in debt.

275
00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:28.080
for diminished value. tens of thousands.

276
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.010
- It's not that bad.

277
00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:30.873
- It needs to be fixed.

278
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:33.780
because he no longer owns this place.

279
00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:37.560
He needs to accept that.
this is disgusting.

280
00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:41.293
He can't live like this and
you're fricking helping him.

281
00:13:42.173 --> 00:13:44.253
(birds chirping)
- Get it.

282
00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:48.413
- [Duncan] Good seeing you Edward.

283
00:13:50.483 --> 00:13:52.900
- You too Duncan.
(car alarm chimes)

284
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:56.313
You look good.
(car door slams)

285
00:13:57.295 --> 00:14:02.295
(soft music)
(car engine revving)

286
00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:07.640
(food sizzling)
(utensils clattering)

287
00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.228
Hey. did you know that--?
- Man. that guy's a dick!

288
00:14:10.228 --> 00:14:12.300
(utensils clattering)

289
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.133
- What happened?
(utensils clattering)

290
00:14:13.133 --> 00:14:15.380
How did you do this?
(utensils clattering)

291
00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:17.220
- [Charlie] Just a little fire. no biggie.

292
00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.110
Anyways. what are you doing?

293
00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:19.678
What's on the schedule for tonight?

294
00:14:19.678 --> 00:14:21.047
(food sizzling)

295
00:14:21.047 --> 00:14:22.810
- Are you cooking food?

296
00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:25.692
- Yeah. smells great. huh?
(utensils clatter)

297
00:14:25.692 --> 00:14:30.421
(Ed speaks indistinctly)
(food sizzling)

298
00:14:30.421 --> 00:14:35.421
(Ed groans)
(Ed coughs)

299
00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.883
Amateur. (whistles)
(Ed groans)

300
00:14:38.791 --> 00:14:43.458
(Ed coughs)
(Ed groans)

301
00:14:49.275 --> 00:14:51.963
(Ed sighs)

302
00:14:51.963 --> 00:14:54.230
(birds chirping)

303
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.958
(soft music)

304
00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.560
(Ed sighs)

305
00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:00.393
- Charlie?

306
00:15:04.593 --> 00:15:05.753
What the fuck man?

307
00:15:05.753 --> 00:15:09.614
How did this? (sighs)

308
00:15:09.614 --> 00:15:12.447
(objects clatter)

309
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.823
(game soundtrack playing)

310
00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:30.290
- [Charlie] Finally. I'm
almost done with this level.

311
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:31.500
you wanna join me?

312
00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.220
- Hey. you thought about what Duncan said?

313
00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.320
- No. that really wasn't on my to-do list.

314
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.873
until later this week.

315
00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.985
- I do not have enough energy to sit down.

316
00:15:42.985 --> 00:15:44.717
- (groans) I can't help you there.

317
00:15:44.717 --> 00:15:46.880
- But my body is too
tired to keep standing.

318
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.200
- [Charlie] Have you ever tried squatting?

319
00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:52.180
It's really big in Asia.
(game soundtrack playing)

320
00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.416
- Wait. how are you still fun?

321
00:15:53.416 --> 00:15:54.720
- (exclaims) You moron!

322
00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.390
See. God. that's why the
world's falling apart.

323
00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:58.603
people can't drive.

324
00:16:00.696 --> 00:16:04.883
- (groans) And what happened last night?

325
00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:11.600
- Well. it involved fireworks.
a pool. you cried a lot.

326
00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:15.000
We got into a fight with a
pizza delivery dispatcher.

327
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.120
oh. and then you got on a unicycle

328
00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.190
and you pulled these
chainsaws out of the woods

329
00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:22.067
and started juggling them and saying.

330
00:16:22.067 --> 00:16:26.570
"I am king of the bears.
sister!". (laughs)

331
00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:28.165
- Did I embarrass myself?

332
00:16:28.165 --> 00:16:30.030
- [Charlie] (laughs) Yes. (grunts)

333
00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:32.004
- Did I cry about my ex?

334
00:16:32.004 --> 00:16:34.410
- (laughs) I mean. no more than usual.

335
00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.460
- How do you remember
so much more than I do?

336
00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:38.010
- [Charlie] Spirit genetic son!

337
00:16:42.451 --> 00:16:43.310
- [Ed] You know this food.

338
00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:47.013
looks both delicious and disgusting.

339
00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:53.360
My body is so upset. I
am never drinking again.

340
00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.590
- [Charlie] Yeah. I remember
when I used to say that.

341
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:58.520
I was 12 at the time.
you'll grow up little puppy.

342
00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.060
- What'd you do to your hand?

343
00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.833
- Oh. it's just a flesh flute.

344
00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:07.350
- [Ed] Are you. are you still drunk?

345
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:09.238
- [Charlie] Ah. it's an inside
joke. don't worry about it.

346
00:17:09.238 --> 00:17:10.860
- [Ed] Seriously. you can
hardly hold the controller.

347
00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:12.230
- I stabbed my finger.

348
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:15.380
you know. it was an
accident. I'm an adult.

349
00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:16.820
- [Ed] That happened last night?

350
00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:20.016
- [Charlie] Geez. mom. why
are you all up in my jet?

351
00:17:20.016 --> 00:17:23.500
God!
(feet tread)

352
00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.170
- [Ed] So. did you hurt your hand before

353
00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:26.790
or after I went to bed?

354
00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:27.800
- Oh my God. geez. mom.

355
00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.260
Would you stop cramping my style?

356
00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:31.093
- I'm just trying...
- Why you trying

357
00:17:31.093 --> 00:17:34.574
to be all sneaky. sneaky
creeper. stalker like?

358
00:17:34.574 --> 00:17:35.407
- [Ed] All right. all right.

359
00:17:35.407 --> 00:17:36.737
Just let me see your hand please?

360
00:17:36.737 --> 00:17:39.171
- Oh. oh. daddy.
(indistinct) long time. huh?

361
00:17:39.171 --> 00:17:42.010
- (chuckles) All right. okay. okay.

362
00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:44.660
I'm just trying to figure
out what happened. Charlie.

363
00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:48.223
- Lemme ask you something.

364
00:17:48.223 --> 00:17:49.480
do you remember a few weeks ago.

365
00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.940
when I had to do a huge favor

366
00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:53.550
and dodged you to stop talking to your ex?

367
00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:57.000
'Cause I would love for you
to do that for me right now.

368
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.403
- Do what for you?
- Stop talking.

369
00:18:00.515 --> 00:18:03.265
(Blender buzzes)

370
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.010
- How are you so okay?

371
00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:10.911
It's like you didn't even drink.

372
00:18:10.911 --> 00:18:13.660
- What?
(blender buzzes)

373
00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.410
(Charlie groans)

374
00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.123
Oh. perfect timing.

375
00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:24.277
Now. what were your concerns. my friend?

376
00:18:24.277 --> 00:18:25.720
- I'm just trying to
figure it out Charlie.

377
00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.200
- You know what?

378
00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.760
We're almost out of booze.

379
00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:33.650
So what I'm thinking is.
we are gonna go get some.

380
00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:36.260
and I'm gonna go shower. I'll be back.

381
00:18:37.836 --> 00:18:41.169

(shower door rattling)

385
00:18:57.256 --> 00:19:01.904
No.
(shower door rattling)

386
00:19:01.904 --> 00:19:03.724
Oh come...
(shower water splashes)

387
00:19:03.724 --> 00:19:04.944
Ed?

388
00:19:04.944 --> 00:19:07.543
(Charlie speaks indistinctly)

389
00:19:07.543 --> 00:19:09.960
(soft music)

390
00:19:16.317 --> 00:19:19.317
(suspenseful music)

391
00:19:29.654 --> 00:19:33.991
- Okay.

(suspenseful music)

410
00:21:08.119 --> 00:21:09.077
- Hey. what'd you do?

411
00:21:09.077 --> 00:21:09.910
Fall in?

412
00:21:11.533 --> 00:21:13.874
- You're not my mum.
(shower water splashes)

413
00:21:13.874 --> 00:21:18.449
(Charlie humming)
(suspenseful music)

(drink glugs)

418
00:21:32.954 --> 00:21:34.137
- Wo. wo. what you doing?

419
00:21:34.137 --> 00:21:35.087
- I'm just finishing up.
(bottles clatter)

420
00:21:35.087 --> 00:21:37.860
- What you doing?
- I'm just. I'm finishing...

421
00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:40.650
Why don't you just take a seat?

422
00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:43.161
- No. I don't wanna take a seat.

423
00:21:43.161 --> 00:21:45.760
(bottles clatter)

424
00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.030
Why are you stealing my shit?

425
00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:49.870
- I am not stealing
anything. just calm down.

426
00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:51.600
- I am calm. I'm not. not even that mad.

427
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.340
It's not like. you're
not gonna pay me back.

428
00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.010
I'm just wondering. what gives
you the right to do this?

429
00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:57.548
- Because I'm your friend?

430
00:21:57.548 --> 00:21:58.381
- (chuckles) My friend?

431
00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:01.660
What. you had such a terrible hangover.

432
00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.980
that the mere thought
of booze made you sick.

433
00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:06.270
so you had to throw all mine away?

434
00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:08.463
- No. this is an intervention.

435
00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.840
- You think you have a right
to give me an intervention?

436
00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.630
- [Ed] Well. no one else
is. and you need one.

437
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:18.770
- [Charlie] Why now?

438
00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:20.330
Why not years ago?

439
00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:21.540
Few months ago. weeks?

440
00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:22.373
I don't know.

441
00:22:22.373 --> 00:22:23.860
- [Ed] Because you weren't safe last night

442
00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:25.930
and this has cost you
jobs. girlfriends. friends.

443
00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:27.200
and now. a home.

444
00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.780
- [Charlie] No. you
being fucking ridiculous.

445
00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:31.170
I drank because I lost my jobs.

446
00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:32.810
because I lost my girlfriends. because...

447
00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:34.490
And you remember how much
of a controlling bitch

448
00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:36.980
my sweet dear. wonderful mother was!

449
00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:38.150
- This place is worth millions.

450
00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:39.840
isn't that worth your sobriety?

451
00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.152
- No. well. it's too late for that.

452
00:22:42.152 --> 00:22:44.020
- (chuckles) Okay. what
about our friendship?

453
00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:45.550
- Don't be ridiculous.

454
00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:47.040
- [Ed] Oh. I think that pretty much proves

455
00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.370
that you're an alcoholic.

456
00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:49.203
- [Charlie] Alcoholic?

457
00:22:49.203 --> 00:22:51.310
No. that proves that I
don't like you very much.

458
00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:55.280
Which one of us is so obsessed
with fucking sky daddy

459
00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.930
and his little baby Jesus.

460
00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:59.763
just because you can't
maintain a relationship.

461
00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:02.293
Which one of us is miserable?

462
00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.360
Miserably. pining over some boy.

463
00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.060
who doesn't even remember
your fucking name?

464
00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:10.030
(sad music)

465
00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:12.600
I'll stop drinking. when
you stop going to church

466
00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.560
or. you know at least I'll pour out

467
00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.263
a bottle of champagne in homage.

468
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:19.963
- [Ed] This isn't over Charlie.

469
00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:23.410
- [Charlie] So you think
I need to stop drinking.

470
00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:24.910
and you think you're the
one who's gonna do that?

471
00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:26.990
- [Ed] No. I've seen. that
you need to stop drinking

472
00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:28.680
and someone needs to help you do that.

473
00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.490
- So you've been reading
them AA pamphlets?

474
00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:32.190
- Yeah. I Googled around.

475
00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:34.532
- Googled.
- [Ed] Mhm.

476
00:23:34.532 --> 00:23:36.950
- Do you know what the
definition of addiction is?

477
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:38.710
- No. but I'm sure you're gonna tell me.

478
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:41.710
- Addiction. is the inability
to stop a chronic behavior.

479
00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:43.930
despite adverse consequences.

480
00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:45.810
Adverse means bad me.

481
00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:49.960
Me. I'm happy when I drink.
and when I'm sober. I'm sad.

482
00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.310
You. when you start
dating you're just sad.

483
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:54.300
because you're so pathetic and lonely.

484
00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:57.670
no one even wants to be near
you. but you keep trying.

485
00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:02.500
Insanity is doing the same
thing over and over again.

486
00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:04.932
expecting different results.

487
00:24:04.932 --> 00:24:08.051
And I'm happy. what about you?

488
00:24:08.051 --> 00:24:09.450
- [Ed] Look. I'm just trying to help.

489
00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:10.670
you don't need to be a dick.

490
00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:13.160
- [Charlie] Oh. this is
help. this isn't helping me.

491
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.990
This is you being so upset.

492
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:16.850
because you lost another boyfriend

493
00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:18.820
and you're pushing down
all of your problems on me.

494
00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:21.030
just to distract from
your own pathetic life.

495
00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:23.400
- Okay. well you can
say whatever you want.

496
00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.770
but you're not leaving
till I've detoxed you.

497
00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:26.780
- How do you. how do you even think

498
00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:28.740
that's gonna possibly work?

499
00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:30.550
You don't think I'll out maneuver you?

500
00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:31.940
- Do you know what friendship is?

501
00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.220
It's sacrifice. and I don't
know how this is gonna end.

502
00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:35.851
but I want you to be fucking healthy.

503
00:24:35.851 --> 00:24:39.730
- (groans) Yours is
the patois of pathetic.

504
00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:41.670
the preamble of the petulant.

505
00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:44.384
the protestations of the (indistinct).

506
00:24:44.384 --> 00:24:45.230
- [Ed] You know what?

507
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:47.460
None of those words
telling me that I'm wrong.

508
00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:48.340
- [Charlie] Yeah. you're wrong.

509
00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:49.640
- [Ed] All right. well. then prove it.

510
00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.260
Spend a week here with me sober.

511
00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:55.963
if you prove me wrong. I'll
never mention it again.

512
00:24:56.881 --> 00:24:58.800
- I have no reason to do that.

513
00:24:58.800 --> 00:24:59.970
- You're on winter vacation.

514
00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:02.350
I own my own business. we're closed.

515
00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:05.050
I got all the time in the
world. prove me wrong.

516
00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:06.637
- Why would I care to do that?

517
00:25:06.637 --> 00:25:08.410
- (chuckles) 'Cause nothing.

518
00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:11.410
nothing makes you happier
than proving me wrong.

519
00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:12.930
- I don't even like you enough.

520
00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:14.680
to even wanna prove you wrong.

521
00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.230
- We both know that's not true.

522
00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:19.300
- And anyway. aren't you
supposed to wait until.

523
00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:20.450
I've hit rock bottom?

524
00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:21.283
We're not there yet.

525
00:25:21.283 --> 00:25:22.880
- Yeah. well. I'm
getting tired of waiting.

526
00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.250
so rock bottom's coming to you pal.

527
00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:26.083
- I'm not kidding.

528
00:25:26.083 --> 00:25:27.990
this whole God fetish
thing just freaks me out.

529
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:30.379
You stop praying. is when I stop drinking.

530
00:25:30.379 --> 00:25:33.260
- (groans) You're so manically addicted.

531
00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:34.970
that you can't even
stay in the same topic.

532
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:36.530
- [Charlie] You're literally addicted

533
00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:38.300
to the opiates of the masses.

534
00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.530
- Can't believe that I let
you find out about that.

535
00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:42.730
- You talked to a bearded man
in the sky. it's no big deal.

536
00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:44.010
- You don't even really have a choice

537
00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:45.550
in the matter. (chuckles)
- [Charlie] Excuse me?

538
00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:47.060
- Oh. you don't remember that?

539
00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:50.220
You don't remember
yesterday. that's a shocker.

540
00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:53.400
You threw your phone in the
pool. (sniffles) mine's hidden

541
00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:57.230
and the nearest store
is about 15 miles away.

542
00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:58.757
- So you're illegally kidnapping me?

543
00:25:58.757 --> 00:26:00.857
- (chuckles) Oh. I'm legally detoxing you.

544
00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:03.453
- All right.

545
00:26:04.931 --> 00:26:07.327
All right. fine. I drink too much.

546
00:26:07.327 --> 00:26:09.663
I'm not an alcoholic.
- Okay.

547
00:26:09.663 --> 00:26:10.496
- You think you're gonna keep me here.

548
00:26:10.496 --> 00:26:12.504
well then. game on sister.

549
00:26:12.504 --> 00:26:15.254
(seat rustling)

550
00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:20.770
- You want some water?

551
00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:23.673
Nice.

552
00:26:31.861 --> 00:26:35.229
(suspenseful music)
(birds chirping)

553
00:26:35.229 --> 00:26:37.896
(feet treading)

554
00:26:45.249 --> 00:26:50.194
(drink fizzles)
(teeth chattering)

555
00:26:50.194 --> 00:26:52.861
(feet treading)

556
00:26:55.009 --> 00:26:56.621
(bottles clattering)

557
00:26:56.621 --> 00:26:58.729
(clothes rustling)

558
00:26:58.729 --> 00:27:01.396
(feet treading)

559
00:27:04.827 --> 00:27:06.000
(tools clattering)

560
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.473
- Okay. all right. cool. okay.

561
00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:12.613
I'm sorry. sorry about what
I said about. about you.

562
00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:15.160
It doesn't give you a
right to take my alcohol

563
00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.543
and throw it all away but. I'm sorry.

564
00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:21.570
- [Ed] Okay.
(tools clatter)

565
00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:24.451
- It's just that. that
was $500 worth of booze.

566
00:27:24.451 --> 00:27:25.400
(Ed chuckles)
(tools clattering)

567
00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.050
What do you don't think it was that much?

568
00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:29.670
- [Ed] Oh. I think the liquor
and the pool house was.

569
00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:31.520
but you're doing a
terrible job of adding up

570
00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:32.353
the rest of the house.

571
00:27:32.353 --> 00:27:33.330
- Are you kidding me?

572
00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:34.880
- [Ed] Hey. do you wanna fight?

573
00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:37.250
- How much did you take?

574
00:27:38.453 --> 00:27:39.760
- (sighs) Are we gonna fight

575
00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.285
or can I get back to work please?

576
00:27:41.285 --> 00:27:42.560
- [Charlie] Do you know
the worst type of people

577
00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:43.393
on this planet?

578
00:27:43.393 --> 00:27:44.540
- [Ed] Oh I cannot wait to find out.

579
00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:46.640
- People who recline their airline seats.

580
00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.050
people who don't pick up the shit

581
00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:49.280
after their fucking (indistinct)

582
00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.120
and people who try to tell
me how to live my life.

583
00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.120
- [Ed] Well. I guess that
makes me the worst then.

584
00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.300
- What you doing to my truck?

585
00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:55.700
- [Ed] I'm changing the oil.

586
00:27:57.339 --> 00:27:58.339
- (sighs) Thank you.

587
00:27:59.656 --> 00:28:02.083
- (sighs) Answer the question?

588
00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:06.940
- We're friends. we're friends

589
00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:08.590
and my mood is not dependent on alcohol.

590
00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:10.040
so no. we're not gonna fight.

591
00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.903
- Okay. then.
(clothes rustling)

592
00:28:17.329 --> 00:28:18.870
- (sighs) How much did you take?

593
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:21.360
- [Ed] How much of what?
- Alcohol Ed?

594
00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.133
- [Ed] None.
- [Charlie] Really?

595
00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:26.670
(chuckles)
(Charlie speaks indistinctly)

596
00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:27.920
Where is it?

597
00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.680
Where is it?
(tools clattering)

598
00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.490
- [Ed] I didn't take
any. but I guesstimate

599
00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:34.492
that I threw out roughly all of it.

600
00:28:34.492 --> 00:28:37.409
(tools clattering)

601
00:28:39.542 --> 00:28:44.542
(suspenseful music)
(tools clattering)

602
00:28:45.645 --> 00:28:48.728
(objects clattering)

603
00:28:49.566 --> 00:28:52.316
(Charlie groans)

604
00:28:54.237 --> 00:28:57.387
(suspenseful music)

605
00:28:57.387 --> 00:29:00.220
(bottles shatter)

606
00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:10.590
- Hey. you didn't even
get half of my booze.

607
00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:12.180
- You're shaking. I got all of it.

608
00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.250
- No. I've got alcohol hidden
all throughout the house.

609
00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:16.470
so you didn't have time to
search for a third of it.

610
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:17.880
- Yeah. except for the fact that

611
00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.600
I've been coming here for years

612
00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.090
and you had no reason
to hide the drinking.

613
00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:24.130
All I had to do was look
in the obvious forts.

614
00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:26.230
- What the hell are you doing to my truck?

615
00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:29.005
- Changing the filters?

616
00:29:29.005 --> 00:29:32.233
- (shivering) Thank you. (panting)

617
00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.221
(suspenseful music)
(tools clattering)

618
00:29:36.221 --> 00:29:38.929
(Charlie groans)

619
00:29:38.929 --> 00:29:41.283
(drink trickles)

620
00:29:41.283 --> 00:29:43.201
(drink fizzles)
(Charlie giggles)

621
00:29:43.201 --> 00:29:45.414
(feet tread)
(drink fizzles)

622
00:29:45.414 --> 00:29:47.853
(Charlie groans)
Fuck!

623
00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:55.620
All right. challenge. challenge accepted.

624
00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:58.550
- [Ed] Glad to hear it.
(tools clattering)

625
00:29:58.550 --> 00:29:59.650
- What are the stakes?

626
00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:02.270
- I just want you to stop drinking.

627
00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:05.933
- That's it?

628
00:30:05.933 --> 00:30:08.660
- That's it.
(tools clattering)

629
00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:12.477
- Fine. I'm stronger than you are.

630
00:30:13.481 --> 00:30:15.564
- [Ed] Certainly hope so.

631
00:30:19.559 --> 00:30:21.722
(suspenseful music)

632
00:30:21.722 --> 00:30:23.845
(Charlie speaks indistinctly)
(drink fizzles)

633
00:30:23.845 --> 00:30:25.968
(suspenseful music)

634
00:30:25.968 --> 00:30:27.051
- Fuck. fuck!

635
00:30:28.458 --> 00:30:30.509
(drink burbles)
(dramatic music)

636
00:30:30.509 --> 00:30:33.509
(suspenseful music)

637
00:30:39.063 --> 00:30:40.966
All right. changing my mind. (panting)

638
00:30:40.966 --> 00:30:42.080
- (sighs) No surprise there.

639
00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.180
- Where are the keys?

640
00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:44.013
- To the truck?

641
00:30:44.013 --> 00:30:46.990
- I am really trying hard to
be patient with you right now.

642
00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:48.020
- In the ignition.

643
00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:48.853
- Thank you. thank you.

644
00:30:48.853 --> 00:30:50.580
I'm going to the store to grab a six pack.

645
00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:51.630
Do you need anything?
- No.

646
00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:53.720
- Do you need a cold soda?
- No. all right. all right.

647
00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:54.877
I'll wait. I'll wait then.
- Some bananas.

648
00:30:54.877 --> 00:30:56.180
something thank you.

649
00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:59.189
Finally. something's fucking going my way.

650
00:30:59.189 --> 00:31:01.939
(car door slams)

651
00:31:04.122 --> 00:31:05.730
(Charlie speaks indistinctly)

652
00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:06.563
- Did you figure it out trucks work?

653
00:31:06.563 --> 00:31:09.960
- No. I didn't forget. I didn't
forget how a truck works.

654
00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.080
Can you please just help me out?

655
00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:13.270
I'm inside already.
you're already outside.

656
00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:14.270
please?
- Yeah. all right. all right.

657
00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:15.236
I got it. I got it. I got
it. I got it. I got it.

658
00:31:15.236 --> 00:31:18.973
- [Charlie] Thank you so much. (sighs)

659
00:31:18.973 --> 00:31:21.470
(Charlie whimpers)

660
00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:23.050
- Have a safe trip. see you soon.

661
00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:23.883
- Thank you.

662
00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:27.720
And I understand what you were
trying to do was to help me.

663
00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:31.309
but this is definitely above
your pay grade. (panting)

664
00:31:31.309 --> 00:31:34.269
(keys rattling)
- Okay.

665
00:31:34.269 --> 00:31:37.542
(suspenseful music)
- No. no. (sniffles)

666
00:31:37.542 --> 00:31:40.472
(keys rattling)

667
00:31:40.472 --> 00:31:42.260
You did not change the oil.

668
00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:43.158
- I did.

669
00:31:43.158 --> 00:31:45.120
- Then why won't it fucking start?

670
00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:47.274
- I also took apart the engine.

671
00:31:47.274 --> 00:31:49.805
(Charlie exclaims)

672
00:31:49.805 --> 00:31:51.725
Fuck. fuck!

673
00:31:51.725 --> 00:31:53.354
Fuck it. goddamnit!

674
00:31:53.354 --> 00:31:55.605
You son of a. son of a bitch!

675
00:31:55.605 --> 00:31:56.438
Fuck!

676
00:31:57.425 --> 00:31:58.258
Fuck it!

677
00:31:58.258 --> 00:31:59.783
God...Shit!

678
00:31:59.783 --> 00:32:03.341
(suspenseful music)

679
00:32:03.341 --> 00:32:04.320
(Charlie groans)

680
00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.153
Goddamnit!

681
00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.032
Fuck!

682
00:32:10.032 --> 00:32:13.118
(Charlie pants)

683
00:32:13.118 --> 00:32:18.118
(fire crackles)
(feet treading)

684
00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:19.590
This is so stupid.

685
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:20.477
- Fire's good for the soul.

686
00:32:20.477 --> 00:32:22.010
- Not the fire dumb ass.

687
00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:22.950
- Suit yourself.

688
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:24.990
- Seriously. a beer
wouldn't kill me right now.

689
00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:27.200
- I am starting to hope that I would.

690
00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.100
- Just. just take the pain away.

691
00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:31.430
- [Ed] Look. you're
anxious. that's normal.

692
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:33.840
I'm just trying to help you relax.

693
00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.340
bad stuff won't start till tomorrow.

694
00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:38.800
- [Charlie] Yeah right.
(indistinct) chance in hell.

695
00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:40.767
- [Ed] I'm not giving up on this. Charlie.

696
00:32:40.767 --> 00:32:42.000
- [Charlie] Oh. that worked out great

697
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.737
with your ex didn't it?

698
00:32:43.737 --> 00:32:47.366
(insects chirping)
(birds chirping)

699
00:32:47.366 --> 00:32:50.588
(feet treading)

700
00:32:50.588 --> 00:32:53.005
(soft music)

701
00:32:55.556 --> 00:32:58.312
(drink glugs)

702
00:32:58.312 --> 00:33:01.793
(bottle clatters)

703
00:33:01.793 --> 00:33:03.488
(Charlie sighs)
(clothes rustling)

704
00:33:03.488 --> 00:33:05.905
(Ed snoring)

705
00:33:08.551 --> 00:33:13.551
(whispers) Ed. Ed.
(Ed snoring)

706
00:33:15.288 --> 00:33:16.504
(clothes rustling)

707
00:33:16.504 --> 00:33:18.921
(Ed snoring)

708
00:33:21.843 --> 00:33:26.843
(objects clattering)
(Ed snoring)

709
00:33:59.689 --> 00:34:03.313
(ladder clatters)
Damn it!

710
00:34:03.313 --> 00:34:05.093
- You having a hard time sleeping?

711
00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:10.063
- No. I'm looking for headphones.
you snore like a hippo.

712
00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:13.160
- How many hippos have you slept with?

713
00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:15.810
- [Charlie] Don't ask.
- Get back to bed.

714
00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:18.430
- I can't asshole. I'm
not feeling too hot.

715
00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:19.400
- You know the cure for that?

716
00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.260
- [Charlie] I'm looking for the cure.

717
00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:22.093
- It's not the cure I was talking about.

718
00:34:22.093 --> 00:34:24.390
- [Charlie] Oh. were
you talking about God?

719
00:34:24.390 --> 00:34:26.512
- [Ed] I could have.
- You amaze me.

720
00:34:26.512 --> 00:34:27.345
- (sighs) Thank you.

721
00:34:27.345 --> 00:34:29.470
- Not a compliment.

722
00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:30.780
- You won't find any booze.

723
00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:33.860
- Oh. I'll find booze before you find God.

724
00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:34.940
- Game on.

725
00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:37.010
- Seriously. you talked
to a man in the sky.

726
00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:39.359
but me having a drink
on earth. is a problem.

727
00:34:39.359 --> 00:34:41.100
- Do you know what the
difference between us is?

728
00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:43.309
- About 25 pounds and 75 IQ points.

729
00:34:43.309 --> 00:34:46.450
- (sighs) If 10 years ago.
we both saw a man flying.

730
00:34:46.450 --> 00:34:47.283
- Aha.

731
00:34:47.283 --> 00:34:48.270
- I'm serious. this is a story.

732
00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:49.380
- I'm listening.

733
00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:51.450
- Do you want some soda water?

734
00:34:51.450 --> 00:34:54.600
- 10 years ago. we saw a
hallucination of a guy flying.

735
00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:56.940
- The difference is. if
we both saw man flying.

736
00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:59.330
I'd still believe it and you'd
have rationalized it away.

737
00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:00.163
- Thank you.

738
00:35:00.163 --> 00:35:01.380
- Oh. you're glad that
you're lying to yourself?

739
00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:03.260
- Yes. because men don't fly.

740
00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:04.360
- To you.

741
00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:07.010
I felt God once Charlie.
that was enough for me.

742
00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:08.370
- I did too.

743
00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:11.493
but my incarnation of God
was a bottle of JW Blue.

744
00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:14.810
- No. you feel it every time you drink

745
00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:17.200
or at least you're searching for it.

746
00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.370
I don't. I accept what it was

747
00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:21.600
and that I was gifted to feel God's hand.

748
00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.910
And I'm okay living without that feeling.

749
00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:25.790
because I don't have to force myself

750
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:27.158
to pretend it wasn't there.

751
00:35:27.158 --> 00:35:29.147
- Oh you're a regular Mother Teresa.

752
00:35:29.147 --> 00:35:30.490
- (chuckles) Do you wanna pray with me?

753
00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:32.660
- I wanna drink. I'm shaking.

754
00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:34.080
I'm shivering. I could be dying.

755
00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:36.040
you know some people die from withdrawal?

756
00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.420
- Oh. so this is a withdrawal?

757
00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:39.960
- No. I'm not. I'm not an alcoholic.

758
00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.350
My body is dependent on alcohol.

759
00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:43.430
like yours is dependent on caffeine.

760
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:44.510
It doesn't make me an addict.

761
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:46.880
it just means that you're
toying with my physiology.

762
00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:47.719
- Okay.

763
00:35:47.719 --> 00:35:49.469
- (shouting) I am not an alcoholic!

764
00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:52.710
- I believe you.

765
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:55.180
- Stop me from feeling like that.

766
00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:57.940
- [Ed] You're killing
yourself. I'm saving you.

767
00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:00.930
- I've decided I don't have
any desire to live like this.

768
00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:02.980
- [Ed] You will. I'm
giving you your sight back

769
00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:05.230
and that hurts. I know it hurts Charlie.

770
00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:06.990
but you're going to thank me.

771
00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:08.620
- I'm more than likely gonna kill you.

772
00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:09.910
- [Ed] Okay. I know you're in pain.

773
00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:11.063
- Seriously. do you have any idea

774
00:36:11.063 --> 00:36:13.170
how difficult it is to feel
different from everyone else.

775
00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:14.513
and not be special?

776
00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:17.560
To just embrace your uniqueness?

777
00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:18.970
To realize you have nothing to offer.

778
00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:22.590
no talent worth your quirks. (sniffles)

779
00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:26.320
nothing to mitigate the fact
that you're just abnormal.

780
00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:27.750
a Darwinian failure

781
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:29.860
and you don't even have
anything to offer for it?

782
00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:32.150
I don't wanna live a normal life

783
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:34.600
and I'm not capable of
living an extraordinary one.

784
00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.910
I teach math at community college.

785
00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:38.450
- [Ed] I don't want you
to live a short life

786
00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:39.950
and deep down. neither do you.

787
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:41.550
- [Charlie] Yes. I do.

788
00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:43.390
A sober life is a mundane life.

789
00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:45.760
a life of grasping at caffeine

790
00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:49.020
and gods and sex and toys to stay awake.

791
00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:51.990
a life of submitting to the
mundane and the supernatural.

792
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:53.463
Discussing paradox by the way.

793
00:36:53.463 --> 00:36:55.830
it's a submission to the
supernatural and the mundane.

794
00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:59.170
to just slog through this
phases of festive world

795
00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:00.897
we parasitically inhabit.

796
00:37:00.897 --> 00:37:02.880
'Cause I was happy yesterday.

797
00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:05.098
where I (indistinct). but I'm happy

798
00:37:05.098 --> 00:37:07.900
and you're just making
me healthy and miserable.

799
00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:09.223
What sorta hell demon are you?

800
00:37:09.223 --> 00:37:11.700
- [Ed] This is going to be
good for you. I promise.

801
00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.060
you're gonna thank me.

802
00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:15.290
- You already bet our friendship.

803
00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:18.650
(indistinct) you're coming damn
close to bet my life on it.

804
00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:20.520
- You'd rather die than be sober?

805
00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:22.210
- [Charlie] I'd rather have not been born.

806
00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:24.040
but your God didn't give
me a choice in that matter.

807
00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:26.530
so yes. I'd rather speed up
the trip to hell down below.

808
00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:29.010
than soberly zombie through
this life here applebaum.

809
00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:31.840
- [Ed] I see a world where
you're happy and sober.

810
00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:33.210
You don't think you want it.

811
00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:34.270
but I'm telling you that you do.

812
00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:35.823
- Come on. you're wrong.

813
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:38.830
I'm smarter than you
and I know you're wrong.

814
00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:41.530
but you tricked me. and so
now you're stronger than I am.

815
00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:42.480
but you're torturing me.

816
00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.390
I'm gonna be sober and
miserable and then dead.

817
00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:47.313
and that's on your soul Moses.

818
00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:50.143
- Where are you going?

819
00:37:50.143 --> 00:37:53.893
- [Charlie] To (indistinct)?

820
00:38:01.922 --> 00:38:06.922
(Charlie groans)
(soft music)

821
00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:33.717
(Charlie pants)

822
00:38:38.695 --> 00:38:41.445
(Charlie groans)

823
00:39:17.502 --> 00:39:20.252
(window squeaks)

824
00:39:29.537 --> 00:39:32.204
(Charlie thuds)

825
00:39:35.264 --> 00:39:38.181
(insects chirping)

826
00:39:39.956 --> 00:39:41.208
(Charlie panting)

827
00:39:41.208 --> 00:39:43.708
(door creaks)

828
00:39:46.822 --> 00:39:49.655
(Charlie panting)

829
00:39:53.282 --> 00:39:58.282
(feet treading)
(Charlie panting)

830
00:40:03.188 --> 00:40:04.771
Fuck it. goddamnit!

831
00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:09.113
Fuck!

832
00:40:11.498 --> 00:40:14.748
(bottle shatters)
Shit!

833
00:40:15.685 --> 00:40:20.685
(Charlie gulps)
(Charlie pants)

834
00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:26.660
(bottle shatters)
(Charlie panting)

835
00:40:31.892 --> 00:40:34.559
(drink fizzles)

836
00:40:35.943 --> 00:40:38.900
I don't really think you understand it.

837
00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:39.733
you know I'm like.

838
00:40:39.733 --> 00:40:44.150
on my best days. I'm really
difficult (sighs) to handle.

839
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:46.170
- Yeah. I don't need
to understand anything.

840
00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:49.350
- No. you do. I could be mean (panting)

841
00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:50.490
and I'm not just saying mean.

842
00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:53.390
I'm talking about fucking vicious.

843
00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:55.960
You know me on. you know
me when I'm at my worst.

844
00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.100
- Yeah.

845
00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:59.790
- Or you think you do. but you don't.

846
00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:01.640
'Cause once you take this away from me.

847
00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:05.800
I. (panting) just un...

848
00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:10.800
just a straight unholy terror. on you.

849
00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:12.030
But it's not because...

850
00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:13.460
It's not because I...

851
00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:15.830
It's not because I hate you or anything.

852
00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:18.410
It's. it's. you know. I
think you're pretty swell.

853
00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:19.610
I think you're decent.
- Thanks.

854
00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:21.296
- You're great. but I just
don't wanna say anything.

855
00:41:21.296 --> 00:41:24.260
that that could make you.
that can make you run away.

856
00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:27.160
just you know. disappear
forever. you know?

857
00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.153
- Not bothered.

858
00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:31.610
- Do you understand
how difficult I can be?

859
00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:33.140
I think I'm charming.

860
00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:36.610
I think I am just the funniest
fucking person on the planet.

861
00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:41.000
but you know Ed. I will fucking
destroy you (sighs) is...

862
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.030
- You're being dramatic.
- No. I'm not being dramatic.

863
00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:45.530
I've just really tried.

864
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:47.017
I'm trying to hit it at home to you Ed.

865
00:41:47.017 --> 00:41:49.320
and you're really not
understanding it but...

866
00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:51.590
- [Ed] No. what you're doing
is you're trying to get a drink

867
00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:52.980
and you're not gonna get one.

868
00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:54.920
- [Charlie] No. I'm.
I'm. I'm talking about

869
00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:57.603
the immediate situation at hand.

870
00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:00.300
That's what I'm worried about

871
00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:01.580
and I'm a little stressed out

872
00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:03.950
and I just need something
to take the edge off.

873
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:04.783
That's it!

874
00:42:04.783 --> 00:42:06.440
But I don't want to say something

875
00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.912
that's gonna fucking hurt you.

876
00:42:07.912 --> 00:42:09.080
(Charlie yells)

877
00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.122
Come on. do you wanna
hear things like faggot?

878
00:42:11.122 --> 00:42:13.020
(dramatic music)
Queer. cock sucker?

879
00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:14.840
Do you want me to keep going?

880
00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:17.070
Jesus freak.
(fists crackle)

881
00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:18.810
Faggot. faggot. faggot!

882
00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:21.430
Do you want me to bring that
up like the Catholic church?

883
00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:23.916
How God is just nothing but
a fucking disappointment?

884
00:42:23.916 --> 00:42:24.749
(dramatic music)

885
00:42:24.749 --> 00:42:26.490
You're talking to some invisible man.

886
00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:29.119
this guy who doesn't even fucking listen

887
00:42:29.119 --> 00:42:33.463
to what you fucking saying. (sniffles)

888
00:42:33.463 --> 00:42:34.868
Huh?

889
00:42:34.868 --> 00:42:36.200
- All right. let's go.

890
00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.033
- [Charlie] Where are we going?

891
00:42:37.033 --> 00:42:37.940
What are we doing?

892
00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:38.773
I'm game I'm down. come on.

893
00:42:38.773 --> 00:42:40.370
- [Ed] All right. it's...
- [Charlie] Let's go. buddy.

894
00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:41.410
Let's go. I just...

895
00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:42.860
- [Ed] Let's sweat it outta ya.

896
00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:43.700
- What are we sweating out?

897
00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:44.770
Are we gonna run laps?

898
00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:48.123
- [Ed] No. I was thinking
something a little more primal.

899
00:42:48.123 --> 00:42:51.623
(game soundtrack playing)

900
00:43:07.093 --> 00:43:08.160
- Ed!

901
00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:11.740
Started hallucinating. I
see your twin. (indistinct).

902
00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:14.223
- Let's go play paintball.

903
00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:18.220
- That is almost as bad an
idea as playing Russian.

904
00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:20.110
- [Ed] The adrenaline
will help with the detox.

905
00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:21.910
- [Charlie] The only
thing I needed detox from.

906
00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:23.833
is your crushing pathetic personality.

907
00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:27.460
- Come on. stop playing your life away.

908
00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:30.570
Let's go outside. find some
guns and masks in the garage.

909
00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:32.250
- Cool. yeah.

910
00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:33.830
I remember when I was 12...

911
00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:35.257
It was back when I was 12.

912
00:43:35.257 --> 00:43:39.110
- And we had fun. you
need to be distracted.

913
00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:41.137
- All I need to be
distracted from. is you.

914
00:43:41.137 --> 00:43:43.483
Can you please leave and let me sleep?

915
00:43:44.395 --> 00:43:45.895
- All right. have it your way.

916
00:43:50.395 --> 00:43:52.812
(soft music)

917
00:44:32.204 --> 00:44:34.954
(drink trickles)

918
00:44:36.521 --> 00:44:38.707
(liquid trickles)
(Charlie exclaims)

919
00:44:38.707 --> 00:44:39.930
- [Charlie] What the hell?

920
00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:41.740
- [Ed] Come and get me.
(feet tread)

921
00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:44.600
- Where are you asshole run.

922
00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:45.839
God where are my shoes?

923
00:44:45.839 --> 00:44:48.928
(clothes rustling)
(birds chirping)

924
00:44:48.928 --> 00:44:52.237
All right. (pants)

925
00:44:52.237 --> 00:44:55.353
Son of a bitch.
(chair clatters)

926
00:44:55.353 --> 00:44:57.243
(paintball gun pops)

927
00:44:57.243 --> 00:45:00.920
I'm not playing!
(feet tread)

928
00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:03.123
I hope you have a good hiding spot.

929
00:45:04.379 --> 00:45:06.574
Coming to get you.

930
00:45:06.574 --> 00:45:09.556
(paintball gun pops)
(birds chirping)

931
00:45:09.556 --> 00:45:13.050
I'm really tired and man.
I can still kick your ass

932
00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:16.219
but. I mean like not right now man.

933
00:45:16.219 --> 00:45:18.210
(feet tread)
(Charlie panting)

934
00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:20.053
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

935
00:45:23.587 --> 00:45:25.860
(groans) Son of a bitch!

936
00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:26.812
(paintball gun pops)

937
00:45:26.812 --> 00:45:28.307
(screams) Ed. you did that on purpose.

938
00:45:30.141 --> 00:45:34.255
(feet tread)
(Charlie panting)

939
00:45:34.255 --> 00:45:37.033
I didn't mean to yell. I didn't mean it.

940
00:45:37.033 --> 00:45:39.783
(birds chirping)

941
00:45:40.733 --> 00:45:43.150
(feet tread)

942
00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:45.623
(paintball gun pops)

943
00:45:45.623 --> 00:45:47.067
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
(leaves rustling)

944
00:45:47.067 --> 00:45:49.326
(birds chirping)

945
00:45:49.326 --> 00:45:51.756
You need to work on your aim. you missed!

946
00:45:51.756 --> 00:45:54.506
(birds chirping)

947
00:45:56.080 --> 00:46:01.080
(feet tread)
(leaves rustling)

948
00:46:03.938 --> 00:46:08.898
We've been friends for 20
years Ed. now you are free man.

949
00:46:08.898 --> 00:46:13.820
(birds chirping)
(leaves rustling)

950
00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:17.950
Ed. I have (indistinct) so hard for this.

951
00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:19.450
I'm not feeling well. Ed.

952
00:46:19.450 --> 00:46:22.283
(leaves rustling)

953
00:46:23.839 --> 00:46:26.890
(feet tread)

954
00:46:26.890 --> 00:46:28.810
Where are you?
(paintball gun pops)

955
00:46:28.810 --> 00:46:31.570
Shit. you crazy bastard!

956
00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:34.320
Hey man. I'm here. I'm trying to detox.

957
00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:35.330
What is wrong with you?

958
00:46:35.330 --> 00:46:36.560
Come on!

959
00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:37.393
I'm here!

960
00:46:37.393 --> 00:46:38.820
I got no mask on!

961
00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:41.069
Woo whoo. you win!

962
00:46:41.069 --> 00:46:45.929
Congratufuckyoulations

963
00:46:45.929 --> 00:46:48.230
(birds chirping)

964
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:51.380
We're going home.
(feet tread)

965
00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:52.670
Fuck it!

966
00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:55.700
You be out here by yourself.
I'll be in the house.

967
00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:59.750
doing something more
useful and much more fun.

968
00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:02.135
This. (indistinct).
(birds chirping)

969
00:47:02.135 --> 00:47:07.135
(clothes rustling)
(feet tread)

970
00:47:09.526 --> 00:47:13.843
- (pants) Did he really
just leave? (sighs)

971
00:47:14.717 --> 00:47:16.819
(feet tread)

972
00:47:16.819 --> 00:47:19.569
(birds chirping)

973
00:47:21.539 --> 00:47:23.956
(feet tread)

974
00:47:25.937 --> 00:47:28.770
(leaves rustling)

975
00:47:34.688 --> 00:47:36.393
(paintball gun pops)
(Ed groans)

976
00:47:36.393 --> 00:47:37.326
- [Ed] (exclaims) Stop. stop. stop. stop.

977
00:47:37.326 --> 00:47:38.159
no. no. no. no. no. no. stop. stop. stop.

978
00:47:38.159 --> 00:47:41.100
- [Charlie] I got you
crazy detoxy motherfucker!

979
00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:43.468
(paintball gun pops)

980
00:47:43.468 --> 00:47:48.468
- [Ed] Stop. stop. no. no.
no. no. no. no. stop. stop!

981
00:47:48.961 --> 00:47:51.326
(Charlie thuds)

982
00:47:51.326 --> 00:47:54.633
- (panting) I beat you.
don't you for once ever think

983
00:47:54.633 --> 00:47:57.573
that you can beat me. (chuckles)

984
00:47:58.910 --> 00:48:02.811
(paintball gun pops)
Ow. ow. ow. ow. ow. ow. ow.

985
00:48:02.811 --> 00:48:05.349
sorry. sorry.
(paintball gun pops)

986
00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:08.966
- [Ed] (panting) We done?
(leaves rustling)

987
00:48:08.966 --> 00:48:11.910
(birds chirping)

988
00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:13.320
- [Charlie] You know. some
days you just wish your mom

989
00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:14.997
woulda aborted you. you know?

990
00:48:16.313 --> 00:48:19.263
(paintball gun pops)
Oh. fuck. come on!

991
00:48:19.263 --> 00:48:22.351
(leaves rustling)
(feet treading)

992
00:48:22.351 --> 00:48:23.948
Son of a bitch!

993
00:48:23.948 --> 00:48:25.948
(Ed and Charlie thud)
(water splashes)

994
00:48:25.948 --> 00:48:29.198
(Ed and Charlie groan)

995
00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:37.337
(birds chirping)

996
00:48:37.337 --> 00:48:39.300
I'm too smart to have a drinking problem.

997
00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:40.630
- [Ed] Oh. how predictable of you?

998
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:41.780
- Yeah. but if I did.

999
00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:42.670
- Which you don't.

1000
00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:44.270
- [Charlie] Right. but if I did.

1001
00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:46.730
I'd be thanking you for all
of the wonderful hard work

1002
00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:47.620
you've been doing for me.

1003
00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:50.860
doing what you think
is best for my health.

1004
00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:52.010
- [Ed] Yeah.
- That's what I'd be doing.

1005
00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:54.300
- [Ed] But you don't so.

1006
00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:55.960
what I'm doing is just a waste of time.

1007
00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:56.980
- [Charlie] Right. exactly.

1008
00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:59.239
- Glad we cleared that up.

1009
00:48:59.239 --> 00:49:00.689
- Well. that didn't really...

1010
00:49:01.572 --> 00:49:03.400
It didn't really accomplish
anything. did it?

1011
00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:04.233
- Nope.

1012
00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:09.710
- [Charlie] All right.
have you heard of Godel?

1013
00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:11.380
- Ah. he's a composer.

1014
00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:12.510
- [Charlie] What. no.

1015
00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:13.940
- Mh. then yes.

1016
00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:16.270
- [Charlie] Okay. well
you've heard of Einstein?

1017
00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:17.420
- The bagel maker?

1018
00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:18.253
- [Charlie] Yeah. right.

1019
00:49:18.253 --> 00:49:19.931
Anyway. Kurt Godel was a friend of mine.

1020
00:49:19.931 --> 00:49:21.610
(indistinct) German guy left with a Nazi.

1021
00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:22.950
started acting like assholes.

1022
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:25.190
- You know. I kinda wish
I can leave right now.

1023
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:26.770
- [Charlie] He created
the most brilliant proof

1024
00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:29.500
of the existence of God ever. pure logic.

1025
00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:31.307
- [Ed] Oh. and that didn't convince you?

1026
00:49:31.307 --> 00:49:32.633
That's a shocker.

1027
00:49:33.730 --> 00:49:35.480
- Can't understand. it's way over my head.

1028
00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:37.570
- (chuckles) You're a
collegiate math professor.

1029
00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:40.210
- [Charlie] Exactly. but
that's not the point.

1030
00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:42.510
- [Ed] Please. please get to it.

1031
00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:43.660
- [Charlie] Okay. well.

1032
00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:48.243
these two carrots. these
are parallel lines.

1033
00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:50.600
You know what that means?

1034
00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:54.310
- You know. I never understood
the term mansplaining.

1035
00:49:54.310 --> 00:49:55.420
until I met you.

1036
00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:57.670
- I don't mansplain because I'm a man.

1037
00:49:57.670 --> 00:49:59.270
I mansplain because.

1038
00:49:59.270 --> 00:50:01.800
almost everyone I meet is a fucking idiot.

1039
00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:04.540
and I'm just operating
on past experiences.

1040
00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:06.760
- I know what parallel lines are.

1041
00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:08.930
- [Charlie] Okay. and parallel
lines never intersect.

1042
00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:10.670
Euclid told us that.
but we can't prove it.

1043
00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:11.503
- Sure. we can.

1044
00:50:11.503 --> 00:50:14.050
- Have you gone into the
infinity and checked?

1045
00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:17.140
- No. but--
- Yeah. but common sense

1046
00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:19.780
isn't a proof. a proof is the
mathematical demonstration

1047
00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:22.060
of the infinite certainty of a claim.

1048
00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:23.830
- And you can't just prove

1049
00:50:23.830 --> 00:50:26.360
that parallel lines never intersect.

1050
00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:27.960
even though that's their definition?

1051
00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:29.110
- [Charlie] That's trippy. right?

1052
00:50:29.110 --> 00:50:32.130
Right. all the geometry is
based on the number of rules

1053
00:50:32.130 --> 00:50:33.500
that Euclid called axiom.

1054
00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:36.260
The rules that we know to
be true. but we can't prove.

1055
00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:37.950
- [Ed] Hmm. I'm starting to see

1056
00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:40.022
why your students like you so much.

1057
00:50:40.022 --> 00:50:41.020
- (chuckles) They only liked me

1058
00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:43.110
because I buy all the underage ones booze.

1059
00:50:43.110 --> 00:50:44.710
when they finish their homework.

1060
00:50:46.370 --> 00:50:48.840
- Take back any nice thing
I ever said about you.

1061
00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:49.970
- [Charlie] Here is the point.

1062
00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:52.210
all the mathematics is
based on the assumption

1063
00:50:52.210 --> 00:50:54.240
that parallel lines never intersect.

1064
00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:55.830
Euclid taught us that.

1065
00:50:55.830 --> 00:50:57.680
even though we don't actually know that.

1066
00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:00.330
- Honestly. you're not changing
my day-to-day life here.

1067
00:51:00.330 --> 00:51:01.740
- [Charlie] But this will.
thousand years later.

1068
00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:04.670
this guy Godel. Einstein's
friend had an idea.

1069
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:07.200
What if we take something
that we know to be false.

1070
00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:09.980
like parallel lines will one day intersect

1071
00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:11.783
and we base our mathematics on that?

1072
00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:13.960
- It sounds like a really good way

1073
00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:15.220
to make an engine that doesn't work.

1074
00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:16.680
- [Charlie] Exactly. if
you try to build something

1075
00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:19.470
off of false premises. they
won't work. except they did.

1076
00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:21.420
that's how quantum computing was invented.

1077
00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:23.650
Assuming something that's
false was actually true.

1078
00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:25.570
Case and my point is this.
I'm not an alcoholic.

1079
00:51:25.570 --> 00:51:26.660
never was. never will be.

1080
00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:29.020
But for the sake of this
experiment. and our friendship.

1081
00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:30.080
- Which doesn't mean anything.

1082
00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:30.913
- Right. exactly.

1083
00:51:30.913 --> 00:51:32.120
but because it matters a little.

1084
00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:34.610
let's pretend that I do
have a problem with alcohol

1085
00:51:34.610 --> 00:51:36.520
and I'll stay sober for the next few days.

1086
00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:37.690
- Weeks.
- Okay. whatever.

1087
00:51:37.690 --> 00:51:39.720
Just long enough to prove
to you that I don't need it.

1088
00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:41.630
If I can stay sober for a week.

1089
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:42.463
- Two weeks.

1090
00:51:42.463 --> 00:51:44.820
- Fine. if I can stay sober for two weeks

1091
00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:47.950
and it won't cause a problem
at all. you'll back off?

1092
00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:49.900
- If you can stay sober for two weeks.

1093
00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:52.250
I will buy you a thousand
dollar bottle of gin.

1094
00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:55.350
- Well. see there?

1095
00:51:55.350 --> 00:51:56.853
Math does a wonderful thing.

1096
00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:00.380
- Have you ever detoxed before?

1097
00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:02.460
- I've only ever been drunk once.

1098
00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:05.000
- Well. I saw a movie about
it once and get ready.

1099
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.370
Detox is not fun.

1100
00:52:06.370 --> 00:52:07.850
You're coming up on 48 hours

1101
00:52:07.850 --> 00:52:09.600
and that's when it gets really bad.

1102
00:52:10.583 --> 00:52:12.287
- Well. I mean. I'm tough and I'm smart.

1103
00:52:12.287 --> 00:52:14.370
I'm not dead yet. I can handle it.

1104
00:52:17.118 --> 00:52:18.951
- I certainly hope so.

1105
00:52:32.269 --> 00:52:34.769
(plate thuds)

1106
00:52:35.825 --> 00:52:37.430
(Charlie panting)

1107
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:38.263
- Eat it.

1108
00:52:39.837 --> 00:52:42.713
- But I'm. I'm not hungry.

1109
00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:45.420
- You need the nutrients.

1110
00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:47.160
- [Charlie] So you made a pizza?

1111
00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:50.433
- It's a veggie pizza.
(Charlie sighs)

1112
00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:54.290
- I'm trembling so much. I can't eat.

1113
00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:56.670
I'm sweating in my mouth too. it's funny.

1114
00:52:56.670 --> 00:52:58.880
I just really need a beer.

1115
00:52:58.880 --> 00:52:59.990
- [Ed] You're literally sitting

1116
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:01.974
right next to a gallon of water.

1117
00:53:01.974 --> 00:53:04.255
- [Charlie] (groans)
That's so much trouble.

1118
00:53:04.255 --> 00:53:07.390
- [Ed] Oh no. we should
probably stop then. huh?

1119
00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:10.050
- [Charlie] (chuckles) Really
getting sick of your attitude.

1120
00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:10.883
- I don't care.

1121
00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:17.490
- You don't care that
you're stuck babysitting me

1122
00:53:17.490 --> 00:53:19.840
when he could be out
there on a Saturday night.

1123
00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:22.353
with someone else?

1124
00:53:24.610 --> 00:53:28.093
- Nope.
- That's good.

1125
00:53:30.090 --> 00:53:33.090
- Eat. it'll lessen the symptoms.

1126
00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:34.630
- [Charlie] Oh really. doctor?

1127
00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:35.630
- [Ed] I Googled it.

1128
00:53:43.090 --> 00:53:46.024
Do you... (sighs)

1129
00:53:46.024 --> 00:53:48.700
Do you really think he's
out there with someone else?

1130
00:53:50.655 --> 00:53:52.450
- (sighs) Just saw it on a story.

1131
00:53:52.450 --> 00:53:53.283
- Wait. what?

1132
00:53:53.283 --> 00:53:55.190
- Yeah. this was some like big dude.

1133
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:56.090
- [Ed] Where. when?

1134
00:53:56.090 --> 00:54:00.500
- [Charlie] No. dude. I
was joking just... (groans)

1135
00:54:03.050 --> 00:54:04.470
- Stomach pains.

1136
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:06.047
- [Charlie] Oh brilliant deduction

1137
00:54:06.047 --> 00:54:08.320
and the least you could
do is. be hell for me.

1138
00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:09.820
- [Ed] This is me helping you.

1139
00:54:11.302 --> 00:54:13.800
- (sighs) I hate to see
when you're hurting me.

1140
00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:16.510
- [Ed] Would you rather.
I go with hugs and kisses.

1141
00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:18.863
No. I'm speaking to you in your language.

1142
00:54:23.436 --> 00:54:28.436
(soft music)
(Charlie whimpers)

1143
00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:31.960
- I had my first drink
when I was eight years old.

1144
00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:38.963
my parents were fighting.

1145
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:43.293
they were fighting because. 'cause of me.

1146
00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:47.883
They saw my broken face. (whimpers)

1147
00:54:49.450 --> 00:54:51.790
but I was sitting there
watching them argue

1148
00:54:51.790 --> 00:54:52.760
and...

1149
00:54:57.090 --> 00:54:58.840
they were talking about. you know.

1150
00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:02.530
who should have been
watching me (whimpers)

1151
00:55:02.530 --> 00:55:05.660
and. my mom

1152
00:55:07.550 --> 00:55:10.230
convinces my dad. starts telling him.

1153
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:11.940
you know. you just take him outside.

1154
00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:13.700
just take him outside. take him outside.

1155
00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:15.343
So he takes me outside.

1156
00:55:20.090 --> 00:55:24.020
We finally get to my. my room (whimpers)

1157
00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:25.010
and he just looks at me

1158
00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:27.410
and he hits me in the
stomach as hard as he can.

1159
00:55:32.176 --> 00:55:34.926
I literally threw up on the floor

1160
00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:39.083
and he freaked out. he panicked.

1161
00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:43.260
He was um... (whimpers)

1162
00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:44.630
he was trying to quiet me down

1163
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:48.393
and. and get me. get me
to help him clean it up.

1164
00:55:50.371 --> 00:55:53.361
(Charlie whimpers)

1165
00:55:53.361 --> 00:55:56.363
I mean. I know he
didn't. he didn't really.

1166
00:55:56.363 --> 00:55:57.580
he was just the angry with...

1167
00:55:57.580 --> 00:55:59.523
He didn't really mean to do that.

1168
00:56:01.073 --> 00:56:03.370
But I just felt. I knew that they were.

1169
00:56:03.370 --> 00:56:08.370
they were fighting because my
dad was cheating on my mom.

1170
00:56:08.770 --> 00:56:11.013
I just felt so bad for it.

1171
00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:14.950
so I was glad that she divorced him.

1172
00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:19.950
but. he's still my dad
and I still miss him

1173
00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:24.883
and you know. loved each
other. and they loved me.

1174
00:56:24.883 --> 00:56:28.063
They just weren't right. (whimpers)

1175
00:56:29.158 --> 00:56:31.577
(Charlie sighs)

1176
00:56:31.577 --> 00:56:32.880
Well. just something about that night.

1177
00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:34.830
it just really. really stuck with me.

1178
00:56:34.830 --> 00:56:39.240
I just. that was the first
time I ever felt powerless

1179
00:56:42.450 --> 00:56:45.880
and you know. I snuck downstairs

1180
00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:49.427
and. I went into the 'frigerator

1181
00:56:49.427 --> 00:56:53.430
and I grabbed a beer and
I didn't know any better.

1182
00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:56.690
I just thought. you know. it was a soda.

1183
00:56:56.690 --> 00:56:58.824
I just wanted to do something different.

1184
00:56:58.824 --> 00:57:01.563
I just wanted to be
bad for once. you know?

1185
00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:06.650
Irregardless. that's what happened.

1186
00:57:12.930 --> 00:57:16.830
- We're gonna get you better.
(Charlie sniffles)

1187
00:57:16.830 --> 00:57:19.653
- I just wanna go to sleep. (sniffles)

1188
00:57:27.472 --> 00:57:32.472
- Okay. I'm gonna go downstairs.

1189
00:57:35.330 --> 00:57:36.350
I'll be waiting.

1190
00:57:44.723 --> 00:57:47.640
(clothes rustling)

1191
00:57:48.514 --> 00:57:51.431
(Charlie whimpers)

1192
00:57:56.539 --> 00:57:58.179
(soft music)

1193
00:57:58.179 --> 00:58:03.096
(door creaks)
(soft music)

1194
00:58:18.185 --> 00:58:21.185
(suspenseful music)

1195
00:58:29.158 --> 00:58:30.845
(Charlie panting)

1196
00:58:30.845 --> 00:58:32.503
(Charlie speaks indistinctly)

1197
00:58:32.503 --> 00:58:35.586
(objects clattering)

1198
00:58:43.052 --> 00:58:46.467
- Ah (indistinct) alcohol.
(suspenseful music)

1199
00:58:46.467 --> 00:58:48.092
(Charlie gulps)

1200
00:58:48.092 --> 00:58:50.520
(Charlie coughs)

1201
00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:53.270
(Charlie groans)

1202
00:59:01.762 --> 00:59:06.762
(bottle clatters)
(Charlie groans)

1203
00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:15.085
- [Ed] Charlie. I thought you
said you were going to sleep.

1204
00:59:15.085 --> 00:59:17.835
(Charlie groans)

1205
00:59:22.694 --> 00:59:25.169
(door creaks)
(Charlie whimpers)

1206
00:59:25.169 --> 00:59:26.896
(exclaims) What the hell did you do?

1207
00:59:26.896 --> 00:59:27.990
(Charlie whimpers)

1208
00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:30.760
You idiot. you just got
halfway through detoxing.

What the hell do you think you're doing?

1368
01:12:29.417 --> 01:12:32.423
- I'm having a nightcap. Eddie old chap.

1369
01:12:35.150 --> 01:12:36.500
- What made you like this?

1370
01:12:37.824 --> 01:12:41.170
What is would this need to
escape reality for 20 years?

1371
01:12:41.170 --> 01:12:43.260
What was so tragic and so horrible

1372
01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:45.500
that you needed to be medicated
out of your existence.

1373
01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:48.063
every single second of
every single fucking day.

1374

- Yeah. so tragic. so tragic.

1375

Hey Freud. fucking genius.

1376

If you recall. in our last
discussions. in my memoirs.

1377
01:12:56.900 --> 01:13:01.010
I am perfectly ecstatically
happy with my mode of existence.

1378
01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:03.530
You seem to be the only person
that has a problem with it.

1379
01:13:03.530 --> 01:13:06.053
- This. this is happiness to you?

1380
01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:08.527
Look at it.

1381
01:13:08.527 --> 01:13:09.740
- No. you know. you know this.

1382
01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:13.033
have you even considered that
this is probably your fault?

1383
01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:18.053
Who was the first person I got drunk with?

1384
01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:21.610
You were the first person
that I ever got drunk with.

1385
01:13:21.610 --> 01:13:24.690
Oh yeah. yeah. it's gonna be great.

1386
01:13:24.690 --> 01:13:26.590
we're gonna get drunk
and then we'll get sober

1387
01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:29.450
before my parents even come
and you know what happened?

1388
01:13:29.450 --> 01:13:30.620
It didn't happen all like that.

1389
01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:33.093
because I was the one that
just got fucking hammered.

1390
01:13:33.093 --> 01:13:34.950
(Ed speaks indistinctly)

1391
01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:35.783
Did that happen to you?

1392
01:13:35.783 --> 01:13:37.970
No it didn't. 'cause your
parent fucking loved y'all!

1393
01:13:37.970 --> 01:13:39.240
You're so great!

1394
01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:41.012
Just the golden fucking child!

1395
01:13:41.012 --> 01:13:43.012
- That was 20 years ago!

1396
01:13:47.738 --> 01:13:50.843
(whimpers) Look at you.
man. you're deluded.

1397
01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:56.973
Get the fuck over yourself.

1398
01:13:58.632 --> 01:14:02.334
(bottle clatters)
(feet tread)

1399
01:14:02.334 --> 01:14:04.276
(insects chirping)

1400
01:14:04.276 --> 01:14:07.180
- [Charlie] Will you listen to me?

1401
01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:10.880
Stop. turn around goddamnit.
it was your fault!

1402
01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:12.080
You don't remember that?

1403
01:14:13.956 --> 01:14:15.030
It was all your fault.

1404
01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:17.230
You're the one who set
the wheels in motion.

1405
01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:21.970
- If you're talking about
a game of spin the bottle

1406
01:14:21.970 --> 01:14:25.863
we played when we were 13.
you need to grow the fuck up.

1407
01:14:26.970 --> 01:14:29.070
I read up on it once.

1408
01:14:29.070 --> 01:14:31.750
Once I realized that I was gay

1409
01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:34.990
and it's completely
normal experimentation.

1410
01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:37.760
I thought maybe that night
started it all for me.

1411
01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:39.980
but it didn't.

1412
01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:40.990
It's a rite of passage.

1413
01:14:40.990 --> 01:14:44.880
so in the grand scheme of
thing. it didn't mean anything.

1414
01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:47.363
It meant nothing.

1415
01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:51.830
I was already gay and
you were already straight

1416
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:54.470
and an alcoholic and an asshole.

1417
01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:56.170
- You shut the fuck up. you faggot!

1418
01:14:56.170 --> 01:14:58.960
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

1419
01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:03.960
- (chuckles) Charlie. you
wanted to play too asshole.

1420
01:15:04.441 --> 01:15:09.441
(chuckles) You wanted your
dick touched. you asked for it.

1421
01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:12.600
Literally.
- No. damn. (groans).

1422
01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:15.267
(water burbles)

1423
01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:21.310
- You wanna play?

1424
01:15:21.310 --> 01:15:22.263
Okay
- Yeah.

1425
01:15:23.469 --> 01:15:27.054
- Let's play. let's play. let's play.

1426
01:15:27.054 --> 01:15:32.054
(water burbles)
(suspenseful music)

1427
01:15:34.426 --> 01:15:39.426
(water splashes)
(suspenseful music)

1428
01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:07.990
- Do you kiss me?

1429
01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:10.150
- No. you have to kiss me.

1430
01:16:10.150 --> 01:16:11.511
- Yeah. no.

1431
01:16:11.511 --> 01:16:13.693
- Yeah. yeah. that's how it works.

1432
01:16:15.570 --> 01:16:16.940
- Yeah. yeah. okay.

1433
01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:19.603
- Okay.
- Okay. let's do this.

1434
01:16:20.942 --> 01:16:22.339
(water burbles)

1435
01:16:22.339 --> 01:16:25.339
(suspenseful music)

1436
01:16:44.685 --> 01:16:46.082
(water splashes)
- [Charlie] Fuck!

1437
01:16:46.082 --> 01:16:50.171
Oh God. fuck. (groans)

1438
01:16:50.171 --> 01:16:53.378
Oh God. (whimpers)

1439
01:16:53.378 --> 01:16:57.437
Damn it Ed! (whimpers)

1440
01:16:57.437 --> 01:16:59.647
Fuck. fuck Ed! (crying)

1441
01:16:59.647 --> 01:17:01.178
Goddamnit!

1442
01:17:01.178 --> 01:17:02.936
Shit. shit. shit. shit. shit.
shit. shit. (feet tread)

1443
01:17:02.936 --> 01:17:06.019
(suspenseful music)

1444
01:17:09.106 --> 01:17:10.672
(Ed gasps)

1445
01:17:10.672 --> 01:17:14.913
(Ed screams)
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1446
01:17:14.913 --> 01:17:15.984
Eddie I'm sorry!

1447
01:17:15.984 --> 01:17:18.888
- [Ed] Get the fuck
away from me. (whimpers)

1448
01:17:18.888 --> 01:17:20.587
Get the fuck away from me (indistinct).

1449
01:17:20.587 --> 01:17:23.060
(Ed and Charlie argue indistinctly)

1450
01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:25.095
- [Charlie] I'm sorry. come here.

1451
01:17:25.095 --> 01:17:28.928
(Charlie speaks indistinctly)

1452
01:17:30.976 --> 01:17:33.776
I'm sorry. I can't believe I
did that. I didn't want to.

1453
01:17:34.956 --> 01:17:39.105
Oh my God I almost killed you. (wails)

1454
01:17:39.105 --> 01:17:41.320
I'm sorry I didn't wanna remember that.

1455
01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:44.823
I didn't wanna remember it
was like it was 20 years ago.

1456
01:17:48.634 --> 01:17:50.034
(crying) I'm so sorry.

1457
01:17:50.034 --> 01:17:52.012
(suspenseful music)

1458
01:17:52.012 --> 01:17:55.533
- You're abnormal. you're not special.

1459
01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:58.433
you're not anything.

1460
01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:03.240
Every other adult in the world

1461
01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:05.850
was born into something
they couldn't deal with.

1462
01:18:08.830 --> 01:18:11.503
Why can't you get the fuck over yourself?

1463
01:18:13.972 --> 01:18:16.151
- I'm so sorry. (wails)

1464
01:18:16.151 --> 01:18:20.129
(Charlie speaks indistinctly)

1465
01:18:20.129 --> 01:18:22.796
(Charlie cries)

1466
01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:28.203
- There is a bottle of gin
under your mum's pillow.

1467
01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:31.573
go drink yourself to death.

1468
01:18:33.127 --> 01:18:36.127
(suspenseful music)

1469
01:19:03.007 --> 01:19:06.007
(soft upbeat music)

1470
01:19:10.935 --> 01:19:13.685

(Charlie whimpers)

1474
01:20:00.992 --> 01:20:03.909
(Charlie groaning)

1475
01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:10.483
Charlie?
- [Charlie] Ed? (panting)

1476
01:20:10.483 --> 01:20:12.021
I'm sorry Ed. (panting)

1477
01:20:12.021 --> 01:20:14.438
(soft music)

1478
01:20:15.661 --> 01:20:17.111
- (sighs) What are you doing?

1479
01:20:18.430 --> 01:20:22.007
- I'm detoxing. I'm...
(soft music)

1480
01:20:24.890 --> 01:20:28.960
I promise I will detox.
then I am...(pants)

1481
01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:34.040
- Okay. good luck.

1482
01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:36.760
- [Charlie] No. no. wait.
wait. where are you going?

1483
01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:37.760
Where are you going?

1484
01:20:39.157 --> 01:20:40.640
- I'm going home. Charlie.

1485
01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:42.273
- No. no. no. No. you can't go home.

1486
01:20:42.273 --> 01:20:45.064
You can't go home. you can't
leave me here please. Ed.

1487
01:20:45.064 --> 01:20:46.660
(soft music)

1488
01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:50.580
- You need a professional.
(soft music)

1489
01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:52.040
You need someone that's not me.

1490
01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:54.918
- [Charlie] No I don't. I need my friend.

1491
01:20:54.918 --> 01:20:58.130
(soft music)

1492
01:20:58.130 --> 01:20:59.692
I need my friend Ed.

1493
01:20:59.692 --> 01:21:01.027
(soft music)

1494
01:21:01.027 --> 01:21:03.080
- I'm not your friend. Charlie.

1495
01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:05.770
- [Charlie] Yes we are friends Ed. please?

1496
01:21:05.770 --> 01:21:07.966
Don't leave me here.

1497
01:21:07.966 --> 01:21:10.383
(soft music)

1498
01:21:12.515 --> 01:21:13.348
Please?

1499
01:21:13.348 --> 01:21:15.680
- I don't care Charlie.
- [Charlie] Please Ed?

1500
01:21:16.890 --> 01:21:21.890
- You have plenty of booze and water here.

1501
01:21:21.952 --> 01:21:23.040
- [Charlie] What would Jesus do Ed?

1502
01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:26.200
He would stay with his friend. please?

1503
01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:29.626
Please Ed. come on! (pants)

1504
01:21:29.626 --> 01:21:30.720

1540
01:25:13.940 --> 01:25:15.840
- Hey. go ahead. you can
make it up (indistinct).

1541
01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:16.900
- Sorry I'm late.
(keys rustling)

1542
01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:19.010
my phone lost service about 20 miles back.

1543
01:25:19.010 --> 01:25:20.720
- Yeah. that's why they call it country.

1544
01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:21.800
We're in the middle of nowhere.

1545
01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:23.190
it's a selling point though. right?

1546
01:25:23.190 --> 01:25:25.390
- This is it. she's beautiful.

1547
01:25:25.390 --> 01:25:27.340
I don't think we'll have any problems.

1548
01:25:27.340 --> 01:25:28.980
- Oh. we'll have problems. all right.

1549
01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:31.750
- Well you mentioned something
about the son on the phone.

1550
01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:34.600
- Yeah. the son. is an alcoholic

1551
01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:38.960
and the mother passed away
and left the house to AA.

1552
01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:40.493
so he trashed the place.

1553
01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:43.400
- Well. it looks pretty intact to me.

1554
01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:46.480
- That's what worries me
and I haven't seen him yet.

1555
01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:47.840
- Oh out of sight. out of mind.

1556
01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:49.460
Why don't you give me a tour?

1557
01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:50.740
This will not be a problem.

1558
01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:53.360
getting it on the market and off again.

1559
01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:55.056
- Yeah. you brought your face masks?

1560
01:25:55.056 --> 01:25:58.170
- (chuckles) I have sold houses
that belonged to hoarders.

1561
01:25:58.170 --> 01:26:01.470
addicts. even one that
was literally a meth lab.

1562
01:26:01.470 --> 01:26:03.163
I can handle this.

1563
01:26:03.163 --> 01:26:05.246
- Oh. let's find out. come on.

1564
01:26:05.246 --> 01:26:10.246
(Sherri chuckles)
(birds chirping)

1565
01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:13.440
- Wow!

1566
01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:15.520
- Disgusting. huh?

1567
01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:17.680
- Not what I was expecting.

1568
01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:19.130
- Tell me about the property.

1569
01:26:20.260 --> 01:26:22.263
- Oh. it was a nunnery.

1570
01:26:23.250 --> 01:26:24.810
- Like. with real nuns?

1571
01:26:24.810 --> 01:26:28.160
- Yeah. it traded hands a few
times before and after but.

1572
01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:30.290
still has that homey feeling.

1573
01:26:30.290 --> 01:26:32.120
- Real granite countertops.

1574
01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:34.883
- A hundred percent. lemme
show you the master bedroom.

1575
01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:39.720
- Oh. what a beautiful door.

1576
01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:42.320
- This is the master bedroom.
the mother lived here.

1577
01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:44.940
Come to think of it. she also died here.

1578
01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:47.180
I hope that's not a problem. is it?

1579
01:26:47.180 --> 01:26:48.784
- As long as she's not still in there?

1580
01:26:48.784 --> 01:26:49.820
(both chuckle)

1581
01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:51.650
- I hope not.
(both gasp)

1582
01:26:51.650 --> 01:26:55.350
- Oh. let's find a key
before I show the home

1583
01:26:55.350 --> 01:26:56.620
to any potential buyers.

1584
01:26:56.620 --> 01:26:59.123
- We'll come back to it. lemme
show you the living room.

1585
01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:05.053
- Beautiful.

1586
01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:08.930
- Think you could sell it?

1587
01:27:08.930 --> 01:27:11.310
- Please. I can sell anything.

1588
01:27:11.310 --> 01:27:14.487
and this. this I could do in my sleep.

1589
01:27:14.487 --> 01:27:16.893
- (chuckles) Wait till
you see the pool house.

1590
01:27:21.190 --> 01:27:23.830
(birds chirping)

1591
01:27:23.830 --> 01:27:25.250
- [Duncan] The property is 47 acres.

1592
01:27:25.250 --> 01:27:29.110
in the main house. the
pool and a lot of space.

1593
01:27:29.110 --> 01:27:32.384
- Wow. I might just have to
buy this place for myself.

1594
01:27:32.384 --> 01:27:33.449
(Sherri giggles)

1595
01:27:33.449 --> 01:27:34.282
(Duncan speaks indistinctly)

1596
01:27:34.282 --> 01:27:35.420
- Not your style?

1597
01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:36.340
- Bad memories.

1598
01:27:36.340 --> 01:27:38.460
- Oh. you knew the mother.

1599
01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:40.793
- Yeah. I knew the mother and the son and.

1600
01:27:42.398 --> 01:27:44.495
he's a little hard to deal with sometimes.

1601
01:27:44.495 --> 01:27:46.430
(birds chirping)

1602
01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:50.230
- My sister was an alcoholic. I'm sorry.

1603
01:27:50.230 --> 01:27:51.063
- Was?

1604
01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:54.240
- Yeah.

1605
01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:57.830
- Sorry to hear that.
(birds chirping)

1606
01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:59.913
- This nice. (giggles) it's very nice.

1607
01:28:01.774 --> 01:28:06.774
(Sherri gasps)
(suspenseful music)

1608
01:28:07.199 --> 01:28:10.359
(Sherri speaks indistinctly)

1609
01:28:10.359 --> 01:28:13.359
(suspenseful music)

1610
01:28:25.678 --> 01:28:29.428
(Duncan speaks indistinctly)
