Of course. So I say. God bless America.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.715
Okay. well. that was very nice of you.

176
00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.717
I'm just glad you're both back together.

177
00:09:14.136 --> 00:09:15.555
We should probably go find Marissa.

178
00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:18.015
Do you want to go see my dance?

179
00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:19.767
Oh. um…

180
00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:21.644
Uh…

181
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.191
They go on at 12:30.
I mean. if you're free.

182
00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:31.362
Uh. yes. I would love
to come see your dance.

183
00:09:31.445 --> 00:09:34.782
-Cool.
-Okay. Well. thanks.

184
00:09:34.865 --> 00:09:35.908
-Sure.
-Mm-hmm.

185
00:09:37.785 --> 00:09:38.786
That was weird.

186
00:09:38.869 --> 00:09:41.163
[friend] Yeah. cute guy stole your kid.
What are the odds?

187
00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:46.127
-There was nobody there.
-Nobody where?

188
00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:48.170
The hot dog stand or the lost and found?

189
00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:51.382
They were right next to each other.
Buck 99.

190
00:09:51.465 --> 00:09:52.633
[scoffs]

191
00:09:53.759 --> 00:09:55.177
Tom. you lost the kid!

192
00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:57.847
[dance music playing]

193
00:10:08.524 --> 00:10:09.692
-[music ends]

194
00:10:09.775 --> 00:10:11.235
Yay! Ella!

195
00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:13.070
[woman] Whoo!

196
00:10:14.488 --> 00:10:15.698
[Marissa] Thank you. everyone.

197
00:10:18.701 --> 00:10:19.702
[laughs]

198
00:10:22.538 --> 00:10:23.831
Did you lose another child?

199
00:10:24.915 --> 00:10:25.750
No.

200
00:10:28.002 --> 00:10:31.422
Well. if you're looking for the booth guy.
he's right over there.

201
00:10:31.922 --> 00:10:33.132
[inaudible]

202
00:10:34.383 --> 00:10:35.301
He came.

203
00:10:35.384 --> 00:10:36.427
[friend] Mm-hmm.

204
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:38.512
You should go. uh. thank him.

205
00:10:39.263 --> 00:10:40.097
I already did.

206
00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:41.390
You should go thank him again.

207
00:10:42.099 --> 00:10:44.602
And this time
do a little hair flip or two.

208
00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:47.772
-Ella's coming.
-I've got Ella. You go.

209
00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:51.192
Go.

210
00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:53.027
Go.

211
00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:54.487
Hair flip.

212
00:10:54.987 --> 00:10:55.821
Yes.

213
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.824
That's cute.

214
00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:00.076
[indistinct chatter]

215
00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:00.993
Sure.

216
00:11:02.286 --> 00:11:03.788
You came.

217
00:11:03.871 --> 00:11:07.667
Yeah. I mean. I said I was going to come.
so I couldn't just not show up.

218
00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:09.502
Right.

219
00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:14.423
I wanted to properly thank you again
for taking care of my daughter.

220
00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:16.133
-Yeah.
-It was really nice of you.

221
00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:19.136
And I'm sorry
if I thought you were a creep.

222
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.054
I get it.

223
00:11:20.137 --> 00:11:22.223
There's a lot of child abduction booths
this year.

224
00:11:22.306 --> 00:11:23.933
-It's weird.
-[laughs]

225
00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:26.686
So. um. what was your booth for again?

226
00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:29.105
It was free legal advice. I'm a lawyer.

227
00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:30.356
So you are a creep.

228
00:11:31.065 --> 00:11:32.024
[forced laugh]

229
00:11:32.108 --> 00:11:35.361
No. I'm one of those rare good lawyers.

230
00:11:35.444 --> 00:11:36.654
[chuckles]

231
00:11:37.238 --> 00:11:38.197
I'm Tom.

232
00:11:39.281 --> 00:11:40.491
Lisa.

233
00:11:40.574 --> 00:11:42.159
What do you do. Lisa?

234
00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:43.119
Uh. I'm a writer.

235
00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:45.746
[Ella] Mom. come on!

236
00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.915
[Tom] Oh. are you guys going
to stay for the fireworks?

237
00:11:47.998 --> 00:11:49.083
Yeah. wouldn't miss it.

238
00:11:49.166 --> 00:11:51.502
-I know a great place to watch them from.
-We usually go to--

239
00:11:51.585 --> 00:11:53.045
[both] Windy Saddle Lookout.

240
00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:55.005
[chuckles] Huh.

241
00:11:57.299 --> 00:12:00.720
I'm surprised that we haven't
seen each other there before.

242
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:03.764
Maybe we didn't know
what we were looking for.

243
00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:09.812
[Tom] Ooh!

244
00:12:16.694 --> 00:12:18.320
-Oh. that's purple.
-That was a good one.

245
00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:20.531
-I liked that that one's purple.
-Mm-hmm.

246
00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:24.326
So…

247
00:12:27.121 --> 00:12:29.206
Do you have a favorite restaurant?

248
00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:31.292
Yes.

249
00:12:32.126 --> 00:12:33.002
I said yes.

250
00:12:33.085 --> 00:12:35.296
and that's what brought me to Denver.

251
00:12:35.379 --> 00:12:37.047
Well. I'm glad you're here.

252
00:12:37.131 --> 00:12:38.132
Oh.

253
00:12:39.383 --> 00:12:41.218
I guess someone's
trying to give us a hint.

254
00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:44.513
[uplifting music]

255
00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:10.539
-Trick or treat!
-Trick or treat!

256
00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.378
Ella. slow down!

257
00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:19.590
[laughs]

258
00:13:19.673 --> 00:13:20.508
[blows whistle]

259
00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:21.509
You missed.

260
00:13:21.592 --> 00:13:23.594
[uplifting music]

261
00:13:24.428 --> 00:13:26.305
[no audible dialogue]

262
00:13:36.065 --> 00:13:37.650
There you are.

263
00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:40.027
[laughs] Aw.

264
00:13:40.986 --> 00:13:41.862
I love you.

265
00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:43.155
I love you too.

266
00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:44.824
-Mm.
-Mm.

267
00:13:45.616 --> 00:13:46.826
I love you too.

268
00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:48.994
[whispers] Oh.

269
00:13:49.078 --> 00:13:49.954
Oh.

270
00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.040
-Good night.
-Good night.

271
00:14:02.007 --> 00:14:03.717
[joyous music]

272
00:14:05.678 --> 00:14:07.221
[friend] Five months already.

273
00:14:09.056 --> 00:14:11.475
I don't think
I've ever seen you this happy before.

274
00:14:12.142 --> 00:14:13.894
It has been pretty magical.

275
00:14:13.978 --> 00:14:17.565
Mm-hmm. And oh. God.
Ella loves Tom so much.

276
00:14:17.648 --> 00:14:19.692
-I know. right?
-Mm-hmm.

277
00:14:19.775 --> 00:14:21.443
So what am I not seeing?

278
00:14:21.527 --> 00:14:22.528
What do you mean?

279
00:14:22.611 --> 00:14:25.489
Well. he can't be this perfect.
so what am I missing?

280
00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:26.448
Uh-uh. Lis.

281
00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:29.702
I am not going to let you
talk yourself out of this love story.

282
00:14:29.785 --> 00:14:31.328
I mean. what could possibly go wrong?

283
00:14:31.412 --> 00:14:32.496
Oh! God!

284
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.920
Whoa! Sorry. I didn't see you there.
Are you okay?

285
00:14:40.004 --> 00:14:42.339
Yeah. I… I…
It just surprised me. that's all.

286
00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:45.092
You can never
go too big on Christmas. right?

287
00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:46.844
Hmm.

288
00:14:46.927 --> 00:14:48.137
Yeah. Come on. girl.

289
00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.264
-Right. Thank you.
-I got you.

290
00:14:51.181 --> 00:14:52.224
Merry Christmas.

291
00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:55.269
Maybe I should put that
in my Christmas article.

292
00:14:55.352 --> 00:14:58.314
Wait. Grant has you writing an article
about Christmas?

293
00:14:59.481 --> 00:15:00.566
[chuckles] Oh. boy.

294
00:15:00.649 --> 00:15:03.027
I can't wait to see how that turns out.

295
00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:10.659
Oh. That's sweet.

296
00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:11.702
[laughs]

297
00:15:13.287 --> 00:15:14.705
Hi. Assan.

298
00:15:14.788 --> 00:15:15.623
[laughs]

299
00:15:15.706 --> 00:15:16.999
Is everything okay?

300
00:15:17.082 --> 00:15:20.669
Absolutely. ladies.
Here. let me take your coats.

301
00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:21.795
Okay.

302
00:15:23.255 --> 00:15:24.882
We're going to get these back. right?

303
00:15:24.965 --> 00:15:27.384
Of course.
Tom just wants you to be comfortable.

304
00:15:27.468 --> 00:15:29.720
Oh. okay.
Well. you're scaring me a little.

305
00:15:30.554 --> 00:15:33.140
-You have no idea.
-What does that mean?

306
00:15:33.223 --> 00:15:35.267
Welcome to Christmas.

307
00:15:41.982 --> 00:15:43.609
Are we in the right place?

308
00:15:47.363 --> 00:15:49.365
[dramatic music]

309

[train whistle blows]

310
00:16:14.264 --> 00:16:16.558
Hey. Sorry. guys.
I was running late. Welcome.

311
00:16:16.642 --> 00:16:18.811

312
00:16:19.561 --> 00:16:21.939
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

313
00:16:22.022 --> 00:16:23.232
-Hi. Sharon.
-Hi.

314
00:16:23.315 --> 00:16:24.900
Hi. Merry Christmas.

315
00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:30.197
Yeah. um. what is going on?
Is this for real?

316
00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.574
It's for real. every bit of it.

317
00:16:32.658 --> 00:16:34.868
Yeah. whatever contest you entered.
you won it.

318
00:16:34.952 --> 00:16:36.036
[Sharon and Tom laugh]

319
00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.330
No. it's just to celebrate the season.

320
00:16:40.374 --> 00:16:41.250
Hmm.

321
00:16:41.875 --> 00:16:45.129
-Show them the photo wall.
-Oh. yeah. come this way.

322
00:16:46.296 --> 00:16:47.715
[plays festive music]

323
00:16:49.717 --> 00:16:52.261
Yeah. I got this whole setup here.

324
00:16:52.344 --> 00:16:56.015
We thought we could do some poses
with. like. props and things.

325
00:16:56.098 --> 00:16:57.474
and Santa himself.

326
00:16:57.558 --> 00:16:59.685
Okay. #NorthPoleFever.

327
00:17:01.895 --> 00:17:03.814
Are you guys pranking me?

328
00:17:03.897 --> 00:17:05.441
<i>Ho. ho. ho!</i>

329
00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:07.317
Sharon. are you in on this?

330
00:17:07.401 --> 00:17:08.527
Don't look at me.

331
00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:09.528
[laughs]

332
00:17:09.611 --> 00:17:10.654
You don't like it?

333
00:17:11.321 --> 00:17:13.866
I kind of famously don't like it.

334
00:17:13.949 --> 00:17:15.492
Have we not talked about this?

335
00:17:15.576 --> 00:17:18.871
No. that's-- That's something
I would have remembered you saying.

336
00:17:19.997 --> 00:17:21.957
You do this every year?

337
00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:22.875
Yeah.

338
00:17:23.417 --> 00:17:24.710
But who's it for?

339
00:17:24.793 --> 00:17:29.089
Me. And you guys tonight.
I mean. mostly just 'cause it's Christmas.

340
00:17:29.173 --> 00:17:32.551
And as a reminder
to keep the spirit of the season alive.

341
00:17:32.634 --> 00:17:35.095
Couldn't you just put a Post-It note
on the fridge?

342
00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:36.847
[all laugh]

343
00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:39.683
Think of this as one massive Post-It note.

344
00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:42.061
Okay. but isn't it expensive?

345
00:17:42.144 --> 00:17:43.729
No.

346
00:17:43.812 --> 00:17:47.566
Yeah. If you added everything up.
I guess it's a lot of money.

347
00:17:47.649 --> 00:17:50.319
But I've had most of this stuff
since I was a kid.

348
00:17:50.402 --> 00:17:52.404
I don't buy all-new decorations
every year.

349
00:17:52.488 --> 00:17:56.241
Yeah. but it's still
Christmas-moving merchandise.

350
00:17:56.325 --> 00:18:00.287
I mean. would anybody
ever have a nutcracker

351
00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:02.581
or a stuffed reindeer
if it wasn't for Christmas?

352
00:18:02.664 --> 00:18:05.959
No. but you don't need
to spend money to decorate. right?

353
00:18:06.043 --> 00:18:08.629
I have a bunch
of homemade decorating ideas.

354
00:18:08.712 --> 00:18:10.631
Right? It's just about the spirit.

355
00:18:11.507 --> 00:18:13.926
Is this the work project
you had this weekend?

356
00:18:14.009 --> 00:18:15.552
Yeah. I mean. this was the fun part.

357
00:18:15.636 --> 00:18:19.014
The hard part was getting my work stuff
organized and up to the office.

358
00:18:20.974 --> 00:18:22.726
Why didn't you just tell me?

359
00:18:23.727 --> 00:18:25.521
I wanted to surprise you.

360
00:18:28.565 --> 00:18:29.817
Well. you did.

361
00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:42.079
I put the whole train together.

362
00:18:42.162 --> 00:18:44.456
Hmm. I hope Tom gave you a sticker.

363
00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:45.457
[Sharon chuckles]

364
00:18:46.583 --> 00:18:49.586
Now wait. it's not just decorations.
all right?

365
00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:52.714
Christmastime is also
about all the different holiday events.

366
00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:56.093
There are so many things
going on around town. Here. look.

367
00:18:57.177 --> 00:19:00.013
I am sure you guys
have been to some of them.

368
00:19:00.097 --> 00:19:01.598
I've been to all of them.

369
00:19:02.099 --> 00:19:03.225
[both laugh]

370
00:19:03.308 --> 00:19:06.145
I mean. there's tree lighting.
Christmas carol singing.

371
00:19:06.228 --> 00:19:07.479
holiday productions.

372
00:19:07.563 --> 00:19:10.941
It's fun just to walk around town
and take in Christmas energy.

373
00:19:11.024 --> 00:19:11.900
Is it?

374
00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:15.070
Okay. look. I get it.
You don't like Christmas.

375
00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:18.240
But let me show you how fun it can be.

376
00:19:18.907 --> 00:19:21.535
Well. I guess Ella
will enjoy a couple of these.

377
00:19:21.618 --> 00:19:22.452
Oh.

378
00:19:23.662 --> 00:19:25.706
So is Ella with her dad tonight?

379
00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:29.835
Yep. they have a big cardboard
sledding competition coming up.

380
00:19:29.918 --> 00:19:32.421
I bet I know what the key is. Duct tape.

381
00:19:32.921 --> 00:19:35.340
-What? Duct tape?
-[Assan] You know what they say?

382
00:19:35.424 --> 00:19:40.012
If duct tape can't solve your problem.
you're not using enough duct tape.

383
00:19:40.095 --> 00:19:42.598
-Oh. I will pass that along.
-[laughs]

384
00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:45.184
-[oven timer dings]
Oh! But wait. there's more.

385
00:19:45.267 --> 00:19:46.560
Ah. more food?

386
00:19:46.643 --> 00:19:47.686
-[Tom] Yeah.
-Oh. boy.

387
00:19:47.769 --> 00:19:49.605
Anyone for pumpkin pie?

388
00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:52.691
-[Assan] I'll find room.
-I will too.

389
00:19:52.774 --> 00:19:54.109
Move over. rice balls.

390
00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.195
[Lisa] Thank you.

391
00:19:57.279 --> 00:19:58.530
-Bye.
-Bye.

392
00:19:58.614 --> 00:20:00.991
-[driver] Are you here for Pasha?
-Yeah. I'm Lisa.

393
00:20:04.786 --> 00:20:08.707
So. Lisa. not a fan of Christmas.

394
00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:10.292
I sensed that.

395
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.295
Well. if she survives it. anyway.

396
00:20:13.378 --> 00:20:14.213
Hmm.

397
00:20:14.922 --> 00:20:19.009
-I noticed you didn't mention Santa.
-Oh. that's not a hill I'm ready to climb.

398
00:20:21.762 --> 00:20:23.388
Maybe I can get her to like it.

399
00:20:23.472 --> 00:20:24.973
[screams]

400
00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:26.350
What the-- Are you okay?

401
00:20:26.433 --> 00:20:29.436
Yes. we're fine. Sorry about that.
Just keep driving.

402
00:20:29.519 --> 00:20:30.896
She's just working some things out.

403
00:20:31.521 --> 00:20:33.732
My boyfriend loves Christmas.

404
00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:36.610
-My boyfriend.
-Yeah. did not see that coming.

405
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:38.195
What I supposed to do now?

406
00:20:38.278 --> 00:20:41.031
Just break up
and then get back together in January?

407
00:20:41.114 --> 00:20:44.868
You and Tom are like the dream couple.
You can handle a bit of Christmas fun.

408
00:20:44.952 --> 00:20:46.995
Oh. that was not fun.

409
00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:48.872
That was weird.

410
00:20:48.956 --> 00:20:51.375
I mean. all the decorations.
all that time.

411
00:20:51.458 --> 00:20:54.711
He took three straight days
to do that place.

412
00:20:54.795 --> 00:20:56.755
Well. we know that Tom
can get hyper-focused.

413
00:20:56.838 --> 00:20:58.090
That's the lawyer side of him.

414
00:20:58.173 --> 00:21:00.759
And the guy who never has time
to do stuff on the weekdays

415
00:21:00.842 --> 00:21:03.303
now has all this time
to do Christmas stuff?

416
00:21:03.387 --> 00:21:04.554
That's the beauty of it.

417
00:21:04.638 --> 00:21:06.765
And all that stuff
that he was talking about at dinner.

418
00:21:06.848 --> 00:21:09.268
and the sleigh rides.
and the Christmas movies. whatever.

419
00:21:09.893 --> 00:21:12.521
you're going to get
to see each other every single day.

420
00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:16.108
To celebrate Christmas.

421
00:21:16.191 --> 00:21:17.859
Yeah. well. that's the challenge.

422
00:21:17.943 --> 00:21:22.197
And I know just how we're gonna
have you jump right into the deep end.

423
00:21:22.281 --> 00:21:23.448
Give me your phone.

424
00:21:24.074 --> 00:21:25.617
Give me your phone.

425
00:21:26.868 --> 00:21:27.703
Thank you.

426
00:21:28.287 --> 00:21:29.538
[Assan] Yes!

427
00:21:29.621 --> 00:21:30.872
[train whistle blows]

428
00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.418
Oh. I'm good.

429
00:21:38.005 --> 00:21:39.589
Yeah. thanks for the help. Spielberg.

430
00:21:40.507 --> 00:21:41.466
I did the train.

431
00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:43.343
-[scoffs] Yeah.
-[cell phone chimes]

432
00:21:45.304 --> 00:21:46.138
That's Lisa.

433
00:21:47.472 --> 00:21:49.224
Oh. Sorry. buddy.

434
00:21:50.017 --> 00:21:51.226
You guys had a good run.

435
00:21:52.644 --> 00:21:56.148
No. she wants me to show her
some of my homemade decorating ideas.

436
00:21:56.231 --> 00:21:57.190
[cell phone chimes]

437
00:21:57.774 --> 00:22:01.236
"Tomorrow with Ella after school.
I want to give Christmas a chance."

438
00:22:02.863 --> 00:22:05.699
Huh. That is not the vibe
I got as they were leaving.

439
00:22:06.366 --> 00:22:07.951
Well. that's the Christmas magic at work.

440
00:22:08.952 --> 00:22:11.121
All right. I got to go to my storage unit
in the morning.

441
00:22:11.204 --> 00:22:13.874
pick up my backup ornaments.
I can use those for her tree.

442
00:22:13.957 --> 00:22:16.501
because that is still technically
not spending any money.

443
00:22:16.585 --> 00:22:17.544
You got work tomorrow.

444
00:22:18.837 --> 00:22:19.963
I can call in sick.

445
00:22:20.547 --> 00:22:21.631
[laughs]

446
00:22:21.715 --> 00:22:23.050
You're gonna call in sick?

447
00:22:23.133 --> 00:22:25.093
Yeah. why? Wait. how do you call in sick?

448
00:22:25.594 --> 00:22:26.803
Do you call the nurse's office?

449
00:22:26.887 --> 00:22:28.680
Do we have a nurse's office
at my law firm?

450
00:22:28.764 --> 00:22:29.890
Call your assistant.

451
00:22:29.973 --> 00:22:31.350
Yes. I'm gonna call my assistant.

452
00:22:31.975 --> 00:22:32.893
-Tom.
-Yes?

453
00:22:32.976 --> 00:22:34.519
-Take a breath here.
-[inhales sharply]

454
00:22:35.354 --> 00:22:36.396
-Bigger.
-[inhales]

455
00:22:37.189 --> 00:22:38.106
[exhales]

456
00:22:38.815 --> 00:22:40.192
Just write back to Lisa.

457
00:22:40.275 --> 00:22:42.361
Oh. right. Yes.

458
00:22:43.111 --> 00:22:44.529
Writing back to…

459
00:22:46.865 --> 00:22:47.783
Okay.

460
00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:52.204
Well?

461
00:22:53.121 --> 00:22:55.540
He's in for tomorrow.

462
00:22:56.041 --> 00:22:56.917
A Monday.

463
00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.210
Tomorrow night?

464
00:22:58.293 --> 00:22:59.753
-All day.
-Ah!

465
00:23:00.796 --> 00:23:02.547
-Hallelujah!
-You girls scream too much.

466
00:23:03.673 --> 00:23:05.342
But Pasha. it's Christmas.

467
00:23:09.388 --> 00:23:10.222
[laughs]

468
00:23:10.305 --> 00:23:12.307
[festive music]

469
00:23:37.874 --> 00:23:38.959
-[Lisa gasps]
-Hey.

470
00:23:39.042 --> 00:23:40.085
T-Tom.

471
00:23:40.168 --> 00:23:42.504
Lisa. you're leaving?

472
00:23:43.588 --> 00:23:45.090
I thought you were coming at 11:00.

473
00:23:45.674 --> 00:23:47.926
Sorry. I was up.
and then the storage place was open.

474
00:23:48.009 --> 00:23:50.762
and I got moving.
and I thought if you were up early…

475
00:23:50.846 --> 00:23:52.472
I have to go into the office.

476
00:23:52.556 --> 00:23:53.974
You're not working from home today?

477
00:23:54.474 --> 00:23:55.767
We have a staff meeting.

478
00:23:55.851 --> 00:23:56.726
[sighs]

479
00:23:59.104 --> 00:24:00.647
Are we going to use all of that?

480
00:24:02.441 --> 00:24:05.902
Um. there's two more crates by the car.

481
00:24:09.448 --> 00:24:11.950
Are you gonna be okay here by yourself?

482
00:24:12.033 --> 00:24:13.410
Oh. absolutely. Yes.

483
00:24:13.493 --> 00:24:17.080
No. I still need to go through
all these backup ornaments that I got.

484
00:24:17.164 --> 00:24:19.249
-And do you have any ornaments?
-Oh. Yeah.

485
00:24:19.332 --> 00:24:22.335
-We should see how many we have total.
-That's my Christmas box right there.

486
00:24:22.419 --> 00:24:25.297
Great. I will go through the box
and the ornaments.

487
00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.090
You go to work. Don't worry about it.

488
00:24:27.924 --> 00:24:31.136
-All right. There is some coffee left.
-Do you have cocoa?

489
00:24:32.387 --> 00:24:34.681
-Since when do you drink hot chocolate?
-Cocoa?

490
00:24:35.474 --> 00:24:38.018
That is one of the many joys of Christmas.

491
00:24:38.935 --> 00:24:41.563
Oh. okay. No. I don't have cocoa.

492
00:24:41.646 --> 00:24:42.856
I will grab some.

493
00:24:42.939 --> 00:24:44.065
-Okay.
-Okay.

494
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:45.609
Mwah! Off to work I go.

495
00:24:45.692 --> 00:24:46.776
Off you go.

496
00:24:50.822 --> 00:24:52.199
Mm-hmm.

497
00:24:52.282 --> 00:24:54.868
We need more clicks.
We're not-- Nobody's opening us up.

498
00:24:54.951 --> 00:24:57.537
And if nobody opens us up.
then we don't come to work.

499
00:24:57.621 --> 00:24:59.414
So we want them to see something

500
00:24:59.498 --> 00:25:02.125
that makes them want to stay there
and then go to the next thing.

501
00:25:02.209 --> 00:25:04.419
-Lisa. you with us<i>?</i>
<i>-</i>Yup. Yes. Grant.

502
00:25:04.503 --> 00:25:07.964
Great. So we got to come up
with some new ideas.

503
00:25:11.426 --> 00:25:12.719
[faint rattling]

504
00:25:13.595 --> 00:25:15.222
[Grant] More spitballing different ideas.

505
00:25:15.305 --> 00:25:18.850
Somebody threw out something
about this hipsters' climbers club.

506
00:25:21.102 --> 00:25:23.980
I mean. and what the hell.
Glenn's obsession with ASMR.

507
00:25:24.064 --> 00:25:25.482
I don't even know what that's about.

508
00:25:25.565 --> 00:25:28.151
I'm glad he didn't come in today.
I was going to--

509
00:25:28.235 --> 00:25:29.361
[Lisa] <i>Christmas.</i>

510
00:25:29.861 --> 00:25:31.571
<i>One man's obsession.</i>

511
00:25:32.405 --> 00:25:33.949
<i>one woman's nightmare.</i>

512
00:25:35.075 --> 00:25:36.993
Ta-da! Cocoa.

513
00:25:37.077 --> 00:25:38.954
Wow. that's fancy.

514
00:25:39.538 --> 00:25:42.874
I put the tiniest little bit of nutmeg
in it to give it a kick.

515
00:25:43.542 --> 00:25:45.877
-I have nutmeg?
-I grabbed a whole one while I was out.

516
00:25:45.961 --> 00:25:48.171
You gotta grind it fresh
or it loses its flavor.

517
00:25:48.255 --> 00:25:49.839
-Oh. is that. right?
-That is right.

518
00:25:50.465 --> 00:25:52.759
Well. it's not your mom's hot chocolate.

519
00:25:52.842 --> 00:25:55.762
Oh. no. no. It is cocoa.

520
00:25:59.724 --> 00:26:01.518
-Mmm. Wow.
-Oh!

521
00:26:01.601 --> 00:26:04.604
-That is delicious.
-Okay. Okay.

522
00:26:04.688 --> 00:26:06.398
Can I show you what I've been up to?

523
00:26:06.481 --> 00:26:07.983
-Yeah. lead the way.
-Come on.

524
00:26:08.066 --> 00:26:08.984

they don't make iPhones at the North Pole.

Not the point. Tom.

is too young for an iPhone.

00:36:17.133 --> 00:36:21.179
but why does this one holiday
have to be so freaking important?

701
00:36:23.723 --> 00:36:25.641
-Lisa.
-Yes. Grant?

702
00:36:25.725 --> 00:36:27.059
Christmas article.

703
00:36:27.143 --> 00:36:29.854
Oh. just trying to get it perfect. boss.

704
00:36:29.937 --> 00:36:33.065
Well. Santa Claus is coming to town.
and I got ads to sell.

705
00:36:33.774 --> 00:36:35.568
Cha-ching. Let's have it.

706
00:36:35.651 --> 00:36:36.527
You got it.

707
00:36:39.488 --> 00:36:41.866
And that's why he has resting Grinch face.

708
00:36:43.576 --> 00:36:45.161
[festive music]

709
00:36:46.621 --> 00:36:50.625
So then Ella asked
how Scrooge died but didn't die.

710
00:36:50.708 --> 00:36:54.086
She may have missed a few plot points.
but I think she got the idea.

711
00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:55.463
No. she loved it.

712
00:36:55.546 --> 00:36:57.340
-[Tom] Yeah. yeah.
-[Assan] Oh. that's awesome.

713
00:36:57.924 --> 00:36:58.883
No offense. Tom.

714
00:36:58.966 --> 00:37:02.136
but I was ready for a year off
from <i>A Christmas Carol.</i>

715
00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:04.639
-Oh. offense taken.
-[laughter]

716
00:37:04.722 --> 00:37:07.767
On behalf of me and Ebenezer.
He's very sensitive.

717
00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:08.768
[Assan] I'm sorry.

718
00:37:08.851 --> 00:37:11.687
This whole week has been
super eye-opening.

719
00:37:11.771 --> 00:37:16.192
Oh. look at you. getting your Santa on.
Okay. I'm proud of you.

720
00:37:16.275 --> 00:37:17.652
-Thank you.
-[laughs]

721
00:37:17.735 --> 00:37:18.986
Oh my gosh. and Tom.

722
00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:21.072
thank you for talking
to Ella about Santa Claus.

723
00:37:21.155 --> 00:37:23.241
I always dread that conversation.

724
00:37:23.324 --> 00:37:24.242
How come?

725
00:37:25.076 --> 00:37:28.120
Well. I don't want to rob her
of the fun of believing in Santa.

726
00:37:28.204 --> 00:37:30.081
but I feel bad lying to her

727
00:37:30.164 --> 00:37:32.124
and I don't want her
to get teased at school

728
00:37:32.208 --> 00:37:33.834
for still believing.

729
00:37:33.918 --> 00:37:36.295
[friend] Oh my God. I got teased
so bad in the third grade.

730
00:37:36.379 --> 00:37:39.340
There was this uppity rich girl.
Jennifer Alerdese.

731
00:37:39.423 --> 00:37:40.967
who controlled the whole class.

732
00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:43.886
So when she stopped believing.
everybody else had to too.

733
00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:46.555
I was the lone holdout that Christmas.

734
00:37:46.639 --> 00:37:47.682
So tragic.

735
00:37:47.765 --> 00:37:50.434
Oh. poor little baby Sharon. I'm sorry.

736
00:37:50.518 --> 00:37:51.936
I know. right? Oh God.

737
00:37:52.019 --> 00:37:53.312
[all laugh]

738
00:37:57.108 --> 00:37:59.235
But what if he is real?

739
00:37:59.318 --> 00:38:00.319
[Sharon] Who? Santa?

740
00:38:02.822 --> 00:38:05.283
Yeah. what if the believers are right

741
00:38:05.366 --> 00:38:07.118
and the doubters are wrong?

742
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:10.496
-Like in third grade?
-No. like always.

743
00:38:12.915 --> 00:38:14.208
That Santa Claus is real?

744
00:38:16.794 --> 00:38:17.628
Yeah.

745
00:38:19.171 --> 00:38:20.673
[laughs] Shut up.

746
00:38:22.133 --> 00:38:23.259
No. for real.

747
00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:25.052
Tom.

748
00:38:26.387 --> 00:38:27.638
Uh-oh.

749
00:38:27.722 --> 00:38:32.601
Okay. so you think that there's a real guy
who travels around the world in one night

750
00:38:32.685 --> 00:38:34.603
and brings presents to everybody?

751
00:38:34.687 --> 00:38:36.939
Well. just to children. but yes.

752
00:38:38.316 --> 00:38:40.860
You can't be serious.

753
00:38:40.943 --> 00:38:43.904
You believe that there's a guy
who lives in the North Pole

754
00:38:43.988 --> 00:38:46.032
and has elves making toys.

755
00:38:46.115 --> 00:38:47.658
Yep. All that.

756
00:38:50.119 --> 00:38:51.746
But that's not possible. Tom.

757
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:56.375
That's why kids stop believing.
because they start to understand the logic

758
00:38:56.459 --> 00:38:58.419
and it doesn't make sense.

759
00:38:58.502 --> 00:39:01.881
It's not about logic. It's about magic.

760
00:39:02.882 --> 00:39:05.551
Oh. so you think that magic is real?

761
00:39:05.634 --> 00:39:08.179
Christmas magic. Yeah.

762
00:39:15.186 --> 00:39:16.854
Okay. let's just go with it.

763
00:39:16.937 --> 00:39:18.481
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-[Lisa] Yeah.

764
00:39:18.564 --> 00:39:22.485
So you believe that this guy has a sleigh

765
00:39:22.568 --> 00:39:23.986
and it's pulled by reindeer.

766
00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:24.945
Yes.

767
00:39:25.029 --> 00:39:26.197
Reindeer can fly?

768
00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.324
Yes. through Christmas magic.

769
00:39:28.407 --> 00:39:30.743
And he has a sack
that's full of millions of toys?

770
00:39:30.826 --> 00:39:31.952
Yes. he does.

771
00:39:32.036 --> 00:39:34.914
-Because of Christmas magic.
-Couldn't happen without it.

772
00:39:40.503 --> 00:39:43.005
I just really can't tell
if you're being serious or not.

773
00:39:43.756 --> 00:39:48.469
Okay. how does he get around
the entire world in one night?

774
00:39:49.011 --> 00:39:51.764
And don't just say "Christmas magic."

775
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:53.224
[chuckles]

776
00:39:53.307 --> 00:39:54.433
That's part of it. though.

777
00:39:54.517 --> 00:39:58.979
But also. he obviously lives
in a different version of time than we do.

778
00:40:00.231 --> 00:40:01.732
-What's that now?
-Well. think about it.

779
00:40:01.816 --> 00:40:04.026
He can get around the world in one night.

780
00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:05.986
He lives longer than any other person.

781
00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:08.572
That's just about the concept of time.

782
00:40:08.656 --> 00:40:11.409
He lives in one model of time
and we live in another.

783
00:40:11.492 --> 00:40:15.413
I thought you were the guy
who makes a living dealing in rules

784
00:40:15.496 --> 00:40:17.081
and proof and logic.

785
00:40:17.164 --> 00:40:20.501
Yes. Let's talk logic. right?
Let's look at it from your side.

786
00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:23.963
What you're saying is
there's a completely made-up story

787
00:40:24.046 --> 00:40:27.091
that over 2 billion people agree on?

788
00:40:27.174 --> 00:40:29.051
And that every parent in America

789
00:40:29.135 --> 00:40:33.305
is part of some
vast conspiracy to perpetuate a lie.

790
00:40:33.931 --> 00:40:35.975
but the exact same lie.

791
00:40:36.058 --> 00:40:38.352
All right. that seems a lot less logical

792
00:40:38.436 --> 00:40:42.273
than there's a real person
with Christmas magic that we celebrate.

793
00:40:42.356 --> 00:40:44.650
Yeah. but not everybody
celebrates Christmas.

794
00:40:44.733 --> 00:40:46.902
In most of the world. they do.

795
00:40:47.486 --> 00:40:50.239
Assan. you're a Muslim.
Do you have something to add here?

796
00:40:50.322 --> 00:40:53.409
I fought this fight years ago.
You're on your own.

797
00:40:53.492 --> 00:40:57.163
-Assan celebrates Christmas.
-Oh. I'm pretty sure he doesn't.

798
00:40:57.246 --> 00:41:00.249
He doesn't celebrate Christmas
as a religious holiday.

799
00:41:00.332 --> 00:41:03.335
I'm talking about Santa's Christmas.

800
00:41:03.419 --> 00:41:05.129
All right. when you find yourself

801
00:41:05.212 --> 00:41:07.715
humming along
to a Christmas carol on the radio.

802
00:41:08.382 --> 00:41:10.217
you're celebrating Christmas.

803
00:41:10.301 --> 00:41:14.013
When you go to a holiday party
or make plans to see family.

804
00:41:14.096 --> 00:41:15.389
you're celebrating Christmas.

805
00:41:15.473 --> 00:41:18.476
Those are just holiday things
that we can't escape.

806
00:41:18.559 --> 00:41:21.395
I mean. "escape" suggests
that we're all trapped somehow.

807
00:41:21.479 --> 00:41:24.773
But we're not.
We look forward to Christmas every year.

808
00:41:25.608 --> 00:41:29.028
It's the one thing
that brings everybody together.

809
00:41:29.111 --> 00:41:33.616
And you're trying to tell me
that a unifying energy like that.

810
00:41:33.699 --> 00:41:37.620
a global presence
that transcends country and religion

811
00:41:37.703 --> 00:41:39.788
isn't because of a real person?

812
00:41:42.166 --> 00:41:48.380
Well. I think Santa
as a spirit of Christmas is real.

813
00:41:48.464 --> 00:41:50.799
-like you obviously do.
-[Tom] I do. yes.

814
00:41:50.883 --> 00:41:53.177
But I'm not making a joke.

815
00:41:54.261 --> 00:41:56.096
I believe in Santa Claus.

816
00:41:57.431 --> 00:41:59.266
[screams]

817
00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:01.060
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. she'll be fine.

818
00:42:01.143 --> 00:42:03.062
Don't worry about her. Just keep driving.

819
00:42:03.145 --> 00:42:05.314
Okay. we're fine. Go ahead. Drive.

820
00:42:06.482 --> 00:42:08.859
My boyfriend believes in Santa Claus.

821
00:42:09.944 --> 00:42:11.487
My wife believes in astrology.

822
00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:13.280
-Not talking to you.
-Sorry.

824
00:42:15.783 --> 00:42:17.284
This is totally insane.

825
00:42:18.035 --> 00:42:21.080
Okay. I mean.
he did make some good points in there.

826
00:42:21.163 --> 00:42:22.623
It makes you think.

827
00:42:22.706 --> 00:42:26.919
No. no. Sharon. not you too.
You want me just to be okay with this?

828
00:42:27.002 --> 00:42:29.421
Well. you said yourself
that you had a great week with Tom.

829
00:42:29.505 --> 00:42:32.091
Yeah. with Tom and Santa.

830
00:42:32.174 --> 00:42:33.175
[Sharon] And Ella.

831
00:42:33.676 --> 00:42:37.972
Oh God. now I have two people
to convince that Santa isn't real.

832
00:42:41.433 --> 00:42:42.560
She didn't storm out.

833
00:42:43.811 --> 00:42:45.187
She didn't like it. though.

834
00:42:48.649 --> 00:42:49.775
No one likes it. Tom.

835
00:42:50.609 --> 00:42:51.986
That's hoping for too much.

836
00:42:52.736 --> 00:42:54.446
I thought you liked it.

837
00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:58.784
I like you. buddy.
The whole Santa thing is…whatever.

838
00:42:59.952 --> 00:43:01.370
So you think I'm crazy. too.

839
00:43:01.954 --> 00:43:03.497
No. I didn't say that.

840
00:43:04.957 --> 00:43:08.460
Look. if we'll never really know
if Santa is real.

841
00:43:08.544 --> 00:43:13.048
then I'm happy to believe with you.
for you. for us being friends.

842
00:43:14.216 --> 00:43:16.552
I don't have the same conviction you do

843
00:43:16.635 --> 00:43:19.471
because it's not that important to me
either way.

844
00:43:20.848 --> 00:43:24.393
So what do I do? I have the tree lighting
on the schedule for Monday.

845
00:43:25.144 --> 00:43:28.022
Well. sometimes
you have to adjust your schedule

846
00:43:28.105 --> 00:43:29.815
to consider other people's needs.

847
00:43:30.608 --> 00:43:33.027
You want to write
a killer article about Christmas?

848
00:43:33.652 --> 00:43:36.280
I think you just found your in.

849
00:43:37.323 --> 00:43:39.283
No. I don't think I can take it.

850
00:43:39.366 --> 00:43:41.660
No. don't run away. Go deeper.

851
00:43:41.744 --> 00:43:43.579
There's so much more to unpack here.

852
00:43:43.662 --> 00:43:46.749
This is better than an article
that writes itself.

853
00:43:46.832 --> 00:43:48.626
It can be written by Santa.

854
00:43:49.209 --> 00:43:51.211
-Bottom line is. you love her.
-I do.

855
00:43:51.712 --> 00:43:53.672
-And she loves you.
-I hope.

856
00:43:54.173 --> 00:43:57.301
So then have some faith
that she'll accept you for who you are.

857
00:43:57.384 --> 00:43:58.802
I will try to have some faith.

858
00:43:58.886 --> 00:44:00.471
-All right.
-Yes. Thank you.

859
00:44:00.554 --> 00:44:02.514
Hey. that's what elves are for.

860
00:44:02.598 --> 00:44:04.099
Yeah. You're the best.

00:53:16.443 --> 00:53:18.528
Well. don't rob Ella of her belief.

1045
00:53:18.612 --> 00:53:21.114
I'm not going to. I mean. not right now.

1046

But there's gonna come a day.

1047
00:53:22.449 --> 00:53:24.409

and I'm gonna tell the truth…

1048
00:53:24.492 --> 00:53:27.245
I don't think it's fair for you
to put your lack of faith onto Ella.

1049
00:53:27.329 --> 00:53:29.456
Okay. Ella is my daughter. Tom.

1050
00:53:32.042 --> 00:53:34.085
Yes. that-- You're right.

to make a big deal out of this.

Tom. can you read me "The Grinch" tonight?

1055

Oh. you know what? I gotta keep working.
But your mom can do it.

from all things Christmas?

1105

It's totally sold out.

1106

So this is the only night we can go.

1107

You can't keep burning
the Christmas candle at both ends.

I will be fine.

1112

Okay. Well. I don't feel like going

-Once you get there.

1116

you'll see it's really fun.

1117
00:58:21.247 --> 00:58:24.000
Okay. Tom. I said I don't want to go.

1118
00:58:25.293 --> 00:58:29.506
Yeah. but I planned on going.
So I feel like I really need to go.

1119

Then go.

1120

You're not coming?

1121
00:58:38.890 --> 00:58:39.724
I'm not.

1122
00:58:41.893 --> 00:58:44.354
Hey. You can't give up on Christmas now.

1123
00:58:44.437 --> 00:58:46.314
Okay. I'm not giving up. Tom.

1124
00:58:46.898 --> 00:58:48.358
I just need a break.

1125
00:58:48.942 --> 00:58:50.235
Christmas is a break.

1126
00:58:50.318 --> 00:58:53.279
This is when we all get
to be the better versions of ourselves.

1127
00:58:53.905 --> 00:58:55.156
Is that what this is?

1128
00:58:55.949 --> 00:58:57.659
The better version of Tom?

1129
00:58:58.201 --> 00:59:00.578
-Yes.
-All right. I thought so too.

1130
00:59:00.662 --> 00:59:04.040
Because I thought that you were.
you know. interrupting your work schedule

1131
00:59:04.123 --> 00:59:07.669
to make time to do Christmassy things
with me and Ella.

1132
00:59:08.419 --> 00:59:11.214
Well. now I realize that you
weren't making time for us.

1133
00:59:11.923 --> 00:59:13.633
You're making time for Santa.

1134
00:59:14.676 --> 00:59:16.844
Because it's a celebration.

1135
00:59:16.928 --> 00:59:19.681
No. Tom. It's an obsession.

1136
00:59:19.764 --> 00:59:24.018
It isn't all just joy and fun
and rainbows. okay?

1137
00:59:24.602 --> 00:59:29.232
To some of us.
it is empty rituals and broken promises.

1138
00:59:29.315 --> 00:59:30.608
and sometimes. Tom.

1139
00:59:31.484 --> 00:59:33.236
it really doesn't feel good.

1140
00:59:37.865 --> 00:59:38.908
[sighs]

1141
00:59:42.203 --> 00:59:47.333
Okay. when I was seven years old
I found a Barbie in my parents' closet.

1142
00:59:48.042 --> 00:59:50.753
It was supposed to be to me from Santa.

1143
00:59:52.463 --> 00:59:55.508
And when I told them about it.
they didn't give it to me.

1144
00:59:56.092 --> 01:00:00.680
They returned it and they blamed me
for ruining my own Christmas.

1145
01:00:01.889 --> 01:00:05.393
And Santa didn't show up again after that.

1146
01:00:06.311 --> 01:00:09.063
-I'm sorry.
-They put their precious rituals

1147
01:00:09.147 --> 01:00:11.190
ahead of that little girl's feelings.

1148
01:00:13.067 --> 01:00:15.903
And now it's happening again.

1149
01:00:17.864 --> 01:00:18.698
Oh.

1150
01:00:20.158 --> 01:00:20.992

You can't. Tom.

1154
01:00:33.796 --> 01:00:39.135
You can't just wave some magic
Christmas wand and make it all better.

1155
01:00:40.553 --> 01:00:43.306
We're just two very different people.

1156
01:00:48.186 --> 01:00:50.313

keep seeing each other.

1215
01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:56.601
Tom is busy this week.

1216
01:04:56.684 --> 01:04:59.478
How do you know? You didn't even ask him.

1217
01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:00.521
I just know.

1218
01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:03.524
Okay. well.

1219
01:05:04.275 --> 01:05:08.696
what if you just get into a box
and then just slide down the hill? Hmm?

1220
01:05:10.406 --> 01:05:12.116
-[knock on door]
-[Tom] Come in.

1221
01:05:12.199 --> 01:05:13.743
-Tom!
-Yahoo!

1222
01:05:13.826 --> 01:05:16.871
Ella! Hi! Oh. yeah.

1223
01:05:17.413 --> 01:05:19.832
-I missed you.
-I missed you. too.

1224
01:05:20.541 --> 01:05:23.377
-You got a project going?
-A big one.

1225
01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:29.342
Okay. let me look into it here.
Let me see what we got. Sharon.

1226
01:05:29.425 --> 01:05:30.301
[Sharon] Mm-hmm.

1227
01:05:35.848 --> 01:05:37.600
Oh my gosh!

1228
01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:39.977
This is so cool.

1229
01:05:44.231 --> 01:05:46.108
I love this.

1230
01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:48.152
Your place is awesome!

1231
01:05:52.448 --> 01:05:53.449
What's under that?

1232
01:05:55.868 --> 01:05:57.620
-Mmm.
-Uh. whoops.

1233
01:05:58.245 --> 01:06:02.416
How did this sheet get over Santa Claus?

1234
01:06:03.918 --> 01:06:07.004
-You like it?
-Wow. Does he do anything?

1235
01:06:07.088 --> 01:06:08.172
Great question.

1236
01:06:09.966 --> 01:06:13.594
<i>Ho. ho. ho. ho. ho. Merry Christmas!</i>

1237
01:06:13.678 --> 01:06:17.098
It's alive. Mm-hmm.

1238
01:06:17.181 --> 01:06:20.434
-Can we play with the train?
-Don't you have a project to do?

1239
01:06:20.518 --> 01:06:22.770
Yeah. and it's not good.

1240
01:06:30.903 --> 01:06:31.821
When is this race?

1241
01:06:32.697 --> 01:06:33.698
Sunday morning.

1242
01:06:35.533 --> 01:06:37.159
We're going to need a lot more duct tape.

1243
01:06:38.369 --> 01:06:39.870
What's this supposed to even look like?

1244
01:06:42.373 --> 01:06:44.709
["Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" playing]

1245
01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:57.555
[Santa] <i>Ho. ho. ho. ho. ho.</i>
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

1246
01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:05.646
[Grant] Good night. Jen.

1247
01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:25.041
Grant. do you have a minute?

1248
01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:27.626
You want to talk to me?

1249
01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:30.379
Well. this ought to be good.

1250
01:07:31.297 --> 01:07:33.174
Is this about
your delinquent Christmas article?

1251
01:07:33.257 --> 01:07:35.259
Delinquent. Big word.

1252
01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.094
Well. I am an editor.

1253
01:07:37.178 --> 01:07:38.012
Hmm.

1254
01:07:39.096 --> 01:07:41.182
-I don't think I can write it.
-Not an option.

1255
01:07:41.265 --> 01:07:44.477
Grant. You know. me.
You know I don't like Christmas.

1256
01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:46.270
Why would you assign me this?

1257
01:07:57.573 --> 01:07:58.616
[exhales]

1258
01:08:00.701 --> 01:08:04.246
Lisa. I didn't want someone
to just write an article

1259
01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:06.373
about tinsel and eggnog.

1260
01:08:07.583 --> 01:08:11.420
I wanted someone with a very interesting
take on this whole thing.

1261
01:08:11.504 --> 01:08:12.880
And that is you.

1262
01:08:13.464 --> 01:08:14.673
Now. you hate Christmas.

1263
01:08:14.757 --> 01:08:16.467
I know. I get it.

1264
01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:18.969
But the whole rest of the world doesn't.

1265
01:08:20.679 --> 01:08:22.389
So. how do you meet in the middle?

1266
01:08:24.517 --> 01:08:25.684
Is that all you got?

1267
01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:30.689
I chose you for this
because I have faith in you.

1268
01:08:35.903 --> 01:08:36.779
I know you'll find it.

1269
01:08:40.157 --> 01:08:42.159
[tender music]

1270
01:08:44.036 --> 01:08:45.079
[sighs]

1271
01:08:49.625 --> 01:08:51.627
[doorbell rings]

1272
01:08:53.379 --> 01:08:54.922
-Hey.
-Hi!

1273
01:08:55.005 --> 01:08:55.840
Come on in.

1274
01:08:55.923 --> 01:08:58.467
Thank you for letting me come over.

1275
01:08:58.551 --> 01:08:59.385
Absolutely.

1276
01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:04.932
Whoa. that is delicious!

1277
01:09:06.183 --> 01:09:07.518
Brings back memories.

1278
01:09:08.018 --> 01:09:09.520
But I'll never be as good as my mom's.

1279
01:09:09.603 --> 01:09:11.313
Oh. I bet.

1280
01:09:11.897 --> 01:09:12.731
But I love it.

1281
01:09:15.901 --> 01:09:16.777
So…

1282
01:09:18.362 --> 01:09:19.196
Tom.

1283
01:09:20.489 --> 01:09:23.159
So… yeah.

1284
01:09:23.951 --> 01:09:24.785
Hmm.

1285
01:09:26.078 --> 01:09:27.496
I need some perspective.

1286
01:09:28.289 --> 01:09:30.416
How are you so okay with this?

1287
01:09:31.876 --> 01:09:35.588
You have to know. Tom was really worried
about telling you about Santa.

1288
01:09:36.422 --> 01:09:39.550
I mean. I knew Tom for three years
before he told me about him.

1289
01:09:40.426 --> 01:09:43.220
And I thought I kind of knew
everything there was about him.

1290
01:09:43.304 --> 01:09:45.764
and then he dropped this crazy bomb on me.

1291
01:09:45.848 --> 01:09:47.683
But it is crazy. though.

1292
01:09:47.766 --> 01:09:49.476
I thought so too at first.

1293
01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:53.439
But I don't want to judge him
on just this one thing.

1294
01:09:54.106 --> 01:09:55.441
I like being friends with him and…

1295
01:09:58.194 --> 01:10:00.654
I'm not saying it was easy
to have a friend believe in something

1296
01:10:00.738 --> 01:10:04.158
-that no one else over the age of 10 does.
-Right?

1297
01:10:04.241 --> 01:10:08.704
Then I thought about my life
as a Muslim in Denver. Colorado.

1298
01:10:10.664 --> 01:10:13.584
Most days. I'm surrounded by people
who don't believe the same things I do.

1299
01:10:15.753 --> 01:10:17.922
I see the look on some
of the people's faces

1300
01:10:18.005 --> 01:10:19.465
when they find out that I'm a Muslim.

1301
01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:24.637
As if my beliefs somehow
put me in the category of dangerous.

1302
01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.222
or evil. or weird.

1303
01:10:26.305 --> 01:10:28.390
or whatever
they associate that part of me with.

1304
01:10:29.892 --> 01:10:31.352
Once they put me in that box.

1305
01:10:32.561 --> 01:10:33.479
that's all I'm to them.

1306
01:10:36.148 --> 01:10:37.024
I'm sorry.

1307
01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:39.944
Thank you.

1308
01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:46.075
But Tom. he never did that to me.

1309
01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:49.495
He didn't care that my beliefs
were different from his. so…

1310
01:10:50.579 --> 01:10:51.747
How could I do that to him?

1311
01:10:56.168 --> 01:10:57.044
[inhales sharply]

1312
01:10:59.672 --> 01:11:04.176
I hear what you're saying. Assan.
but Santa isn't religion.

1313
01:11:05.552 --> 01:11:09.014
The only difference
between religion and Santa

1314
01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:11.934
is that as we get older.
religious grown-ups

1315
01:11:12.017 --> 01:11:13.811
tell us that our faith
was right all along.

1316
01:11:14.728 --> 01:11:16.480
But they don't have proof either.

1317
01:11:16.563 --> 01:11:18.941
They just tell us that the stories
we believe are true.

1318
01:11:19.817 --> 01:11:23.946
But with Santa. the grown-ups are there
to tell you that the stories are not true.

1319
01:11:24.822 --> 01:11:28.200
And Tom just chose
not to believe the grown-ups.

1320
01:11:31.287 --> 01:11:32.663
You're a good friend.

1321
01:11:33.998 --> 01:11:34.832
So is he.

1322
01:11:38.627 --> 01:11:40.587

Hey. buddy. what's up?

1325
01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:48.178
What time is <i>The Nutcracker</i> tonight?

1326
01:11:48.262 --> 01:11:50.889
I got to load up on caffeine
about 30 minutes before.

1327
01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:52.266
Oh. we are not going.

1328
01:11:53.267 --> 01:11:54.101
What?

1329
01:11:54.893 --> 01:11:57.479
Wait a minute. who is this?
Please put Tom on the phone.

1330
01:11:57.563 --> 01:12:00.399
I can't.
I've got to work on Ella's sled race.

to ever grace the stage

1333
01:12:06.071 --> 01:12:09.867

is going to skip attending <i>The Nutcracker?</i>

1334
01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:11.702
You know my mom wrote that review.

1336
01:12:12.745 --> 01:12:14.038
What about your schedule?

<i>Assan. don't you know</i>

1338
01:12:16.081 --> 01:12:18.292
that sometimes you have
to adjust your schedule

1339
01:12:18.375 --> 01:12:20.044
to consider other people's needs?

1340
01:12:21.086 --> 01:12:23.672
Hmm. That sounds like
some real wisdom. buddy.

1342
01:12:26.383 --> 01:12:27.593

Still in the assembly phase right now.

1344
01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:31.722
Haven't had a chance to test anything.

1345

The race is tomorrow. isn't it?

1346
01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:35.851
Not helping.

1347
01:12:35.934 --> 01:12:37.519
Remember: duct tape.

-Hi.

01:13:20.437 --> 01:13:22.689
-Did you add more duct tape?
-I put on every piece we had.

1358

[woman] Here we go!

1359
01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:25.818
Did you borrow this from Santa Claus?

1360
01:13:25.901 --> 01:13:29.446
Ha-ha! No. but I did
get a little inspiration from him.

1361
01:13:30.155 --> 01:13:31.115
It looks great.

1362
01:13:31.657 --> 01:13:33.784
but we've never ridden in it before.

1363
01:13:34.284 --> 01:13:35.661
What if it falls apart?

1364
01:13:36.328 --> 01:13:39.248
What if?
You better give it a final inspection.

1365
01:13:41.125 --> 01:13:44.044
Okay. so I'm gonna head down
to the finish line. to get some pictures.

1366
01:13:44.128 --> 01:13:45.129
Good luck. y'all.

1367

Thank you for making time for this. Tom.

1369

Ella is super excited.

She really loves it.

1371
01:13:55.013 --> 01:13:58.475
Well. it's the childlike wonder
that makes the magic.

1372
01:13:59.226 --> 01:14:00.144
Hmm.

1373
01:14:01.603 --> 01:14:06.275
Hey. I'm sorry
for putting Christmas before us.

1374
01:14:07.317 --> 01:14:08.986
I got a little crazy.

1375
01:14:11.572 --> 01:14:13.449
I wouldn't use the word "crazy."

1376
01:14:14.491 --> 01:14:15.367
But thank you.

1377
01:14:16.201 --> 01:14:18.495

-And?

Whoo-hoo! All right. get in there.
Let's see how she feels.

What do you think?

01:14:28.755 --> 01:14:30.799
-She feels perfect.
-Yeah.

1382
01:14:30.883 --> 01:14:32.301
All right. let's do it.

1383
01:14:32.384 --> 01:14:35.429
Good luck. You're gonna need it.

[announcer] Okay. riders. Load in.

1387
01:14:45.981 --> 01:14:48.609
Family sled race starts in one minute.

1388
01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:51.570
-Are you gonna ride with us. Mom?
-You should.

1389
01:14:51.653 --> 01:14:54.323
I was just going to watch from up here.

1390
01:14:54.406 --> 01:14:56.867
-[Ella] Come on.
-Yes. there's plenty of room.

1391
01:14:56.950 --> 01:14:58.118
Please. Mom.

1392
01:14:58.202 --> 01:15:00.120
Come on. I can help you.

1393
01:15:00.204 --> 01:15:02.206
I think you're gonna like it… ish.

1394
01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:08.086
All right. everyone squeeze up
to the front there.

1395
01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:10.506
I'm kind of eating my kneecaps here.

1396
01:15:10.589 --> 01:15:14.635
That's how she's designed.
Everything good up there. pilot?

1397
01:15:14.718 --> 01:15:16.220
Aye. aye. chief.

1398
01:15:16.803 --> 01:15:17.638
[both laugh]

1399
01:15:17.721 --> 01:15:19.014
So how do we get started?

1400
01:15:19.097 --> 01:15:20.182
Oh. um…

1401
01:15:20.265 --> 01:15:21.308
Am I in time?

1402
01:15:21.391 --> 01:15:24.228
You are. just barely.
She just asked about you.

1403
01:15:24.311 --> 01:15:25.354
[Lisa laughs]

1404
01:15:25.437 --> 01:15:28.857
All right. when she says "go." you push us
and then we'll do the hard part.

1405
01:15:28.941 --> 01:15:31.568
Uh. pushing is the hard part.

1406
01:15:32.152 --> 01:15:34.321
Riders. take your mark.

1407
01:15:34.404 --> 01:15:35.989
All right. everyone heads down.

1408
01:15:36.073 --> 01:15:36.990
[Ella] Roger that.

1409
01:15:37.074 --> 01:15:39.034
Tom. I really don't know about this.

1410
01:15:39.117 --> 01:15:41.745
It's going to be okay.
It's a leap of faith.

1411
01:15:41.828 --> 01:15:44.790
No. it's a leap off of a literal mountain.

1412
01:15:44.873 --> 01:15:45.791
[laughs]

1413
01:15:45.874 --> 01:15:47.501
See you on the other side.

1414
01:15:48.252 --> 01:15:49.336
Riders ready?

1415
01:15:52.422 --> 01:15:53.882
And go!

1416
01:15:53.966 --> 01:15:55.092
[crowd cheering]

1417
01:15:55.175 --> 01:15:56.677
[Tom] Here we go!

1418
01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:58.595
Whoa!

1419
01:16:01.974 --> 01:16:04.810
-Ah. this is so scary!
-[all laugh]

1420
01:16:04.893 --> 01:16:07.229
["Trepak" playing]

1421
01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:09.147
[grunts]

1422
01:16:14.027 --> 01:16:15.445
One sled left to catch!

1423
01:16:18.156 --> 01:16:19.449
We got 'em!

1424
01:16:26.915 --> 01:16:30.335
We can catch them if we take the jump.
Lean right.

1425
01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:32.296
[all scream and laugh]

1426
01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:35.257
-Brace yourself!
-Ah!

1427
01:16:37.175 --> 01:16:39.011
[Tom] It'll go faster in the air.

1428
01:16:42.389 --> 01:16:43.432
-[crowd gasping]
-Oh my God!

1429
01:16:47.477 --> 01:16:48.770
No!

1430
01:16:51.356 --> 01:16:52.524
[no audible dialogue]

1431
01:16:53.775 --> 01:16:55.277
Ah!

1432
01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:56.236
Come on!

1433
01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:03.744
-[all laughing]
-[crowd cheering]

1434
01:17:03.827 --> 01:17:04.828
Yes!

1435
01:17:04.911 --> 01:17:06.163
[grunts]

1436
01:17:06.246 --> 01:17:07.372
-[Tom] Oh!
-Yay!

1437
01:17:07.456 --> 01:17:09.249
-We did it! Yes we…
-We won!

1438
01:17:09.333 --> 01:17:11.126
Ah! They won!

1439
01:17:11.209 --> 01:17:13.587
-[Lisa] We won!
-[Tom] Yeah! We won!

1440
01:17:13.670 --> 01:17:14.963
[laughing] Yeah!

1441
01:17:16.798 --> 01:17:18.842
Okay! Cheese!

1442
01:17:19.968 --> 01:17:20.844
I pushed them.

1443
01:17:21.887 --> 01:17:23.889
[tender music]

1444
01:17:26.892 --> 01:17:29.269
[Tom] How is the cocoa here at the lodge?

1445
01:17:29.353 --> 01:17:32.105
[Ella] It's okay.
but not as good as yours.

1446
01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:34.983
Well. I'm gonna make you the cocoa
of champions when we get home

1447
01:17:35.067 --> 01:17:36.568
[all laugh]

1448
01:17:36.652 --> 01:17:39.363
Oh. I'll be talking
about this team forever.

1449
01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:40.989
We're legend.

1450
01:17:41.073 --> 01:17:42.908
-Oh. yes. we are.
-Yes.

1451
01:17:42.991 --> 01:17:45.702
Well. couldn't have done it
without a little push from Assan.

1452
01:17:46.703 --> 01:17:48.038
Thank you. Assan.

1453
01:17:48.121 --> 01:17:51.875
Ahem. um. I would like
to say something to everybody.

1454
01:17:51.958 --> 01:17:53.710
You're going to stand now?

1455
01:17:53.794 --> 01:17:55.545
This is pretty important. Yeah.

1456
01:17:55.629 --> 01:17:56.922
-[Assan] Here it comes.
-Okay.

1457
01:17:57.589 --> 01:18:01.635
Um. you all know that I love Christmas.

1458
01:18:01.718 --> 01:18:02.594
Understatement.

1459
01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:08.684
But this year I learned
that Christmas can come with challenges

1460
01:18:08.767 --> 01:18:10.060
as well as gifts.

1461
01:18:10.143 --> 01:18:13.605
and that it's the time of year to reflect.

1462
01:18:13.689 --> 01:18:16.650
But reflection can sometimes be painful.

1463
01:18:16.733 --> 01:18:21.738
But I know that I can embrace
whatever the season may bring.

1464
01:18:22.948 --> 01:18:26.034
And that it's spending time
with the people you love

1465
01:18:26.118 --> 01:18:27.911
that makes Christmas magical.

1466
01:18:27.994 --> 01:18:31.540
Not just decorations or holiday events.

1467
01:18:31.623 --> 01:18:32.833
Amen. brother.

1468
01:18:32.916 --> 01:18:33.750
Right.

1469
01:18:34.501 --> 01:18:35.419
[Assan chuckles]

1470
01:18:36.586 --> 01:18:38.588
Well. I want to say something too.

1471
01:18:38.672 --> 01:18:40.048
Oh. here it comes.

1472
01:18:40.132 --> 01:18:41.174
Yeah.

1473
01:18:42.259 --> 01:18:46.388
Um. well. you all know
I was a little reluctant about Christmas.

1474
01:18:46.471 --> 01:18:47.305
A little?

1475
01:18:47.389 --> 01:18:48.640
[laughs]

1476
01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:50.726
But. Tom. you have taught me

1477
01:18:50.809 --> 01:18:55.313
that it's not just
about strict traditions.

1478
01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:56.898
It can be fun again.

1479
01:18:57.482 --> 01:19:02.404
And there isn't always a Barbie
hiding in the closet to ruin everything.

1480
01:19:04.364 --> 01:19:06.825
-A what now?
-Don't stop her. She's on a roll.

1481
01:19:06.908 --> 01:19:08.034
[whispering] Oh. okay.

1482
01:19:08.577 --> 01:19:09.453
Tom.

1483
01:19:10.078 --> 01:19:11.788
You did this thing for Ella.

1484
01:19:13.039 --> 01:19:14.916
Not because it was Christmas.

1485
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.878
but because you love her and me.

1486
01:19:19.087 --> 01:19:22.799
And when we needed you most.
you were there all in.

1487
01:19:23.425 --> 01:19:26.219
And that's the kind of magic
that I want to believe in.

1488
01:19:27.345 --> 01:19:28.597
[Sharon] Aw.

1489
01:19:29.181 --> 01:19:30.348
Amen. sister.

1490
01:19:31.641 --> 01:19:34.394
And that thing
that I said the other night.

1491
01:19:34.978 --> 01:19:36.104
could I take that back?

1492
01:19:36.188 --> 01:19:37.731
Please. Yes. Please.

1493
01:19:37.814 --> 01:19:40.066
-I agree. yes. thank you.
-Mmm.

1494
01:19:40.984 --> 01:19:41.818
Called it.

1495
01:19:41.902 --> 01:19:43.904
Yeah. it didn't take a genius.

1496
01:19:44.654 --> 01:19:47.407
-But I have one more thing.
-Oh. but I had one more thing.

1497
01:19:47.491 --> 01:19:50.076
-Well. is your thing my thing?
-I don't know what your thing is.

1498
01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:52.370
-Maybe you just do your thing.
-You should do your thing.

1499
01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:54.164
Someone do their thing.

1500
01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:57.459
You do it. You do it. please.

1501
01:19:57.542 --> 01:19:58.502
[Lisa] Okay.

1502
01:19:59.878 --> 01:20:04.883
Tom. I don't ever want you
to lose your belief in Santa.

1503
01:20:05.425 --> 01:20:06.635
your love of Christmas.

1504
01:20:07.427 --> 01:20:09.221
Because you've taught me
how important it is

1505
01:20:09.304 --> 01:20:12.015
to believe in something
bigger than ourselves.

1506
01:20:12.891 --> 01:20:14.392
And something we can't prove.

1507
01:20:15.018 --> 01:20:16.520
And that every grown-up

1508
01:20:16.603 --> 01:20:19.898
should be able to tap into
that childlike wonder

1509
01:20:19.981 --> 01:20:21.983
that just makes life sweeter.

1510
01:20:22.526 --> 01:20:23.735
Oh.

1511
01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:26.196
Wait. they're not done yet.

1512
01:20:26.738 --> 01:20:29.741
Stay right there. Just gonna do my thing.

1513
01:20:30.325 --> 01:20:32.160
-It's a different thing.
-I knew it.

1514
01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:35.497
[exhales] I made this list.

1515
01:20:36.331 --> 01:20:40.168
This is my wish list for Santa this year.

1516
01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:49.094
That's it.

1517
01:20:50.178 --> 01:20:51.847
This is everything I want.

1518
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:54.224
It's us.

1519
01:20:57.686 --> 01:21:02.607
Ella. you are the coolest kid
I have ever met.

1520
01:21:03.191 --> 01:21:07.028
and I promise to always be your friend.

1521
01:21:12.075 --> 01:21:12.951
And Lisa.

1522
01:21:15.078 --> 01:21:20.208
I love you more than
I could even put into words.

1523
01:21:21.209 --> 01:21:22.043
So…

1524
01:21:23.587 --> 01:21:27.048
Instead. I am going
to take a leap of faith

1525
01:21:27.841 --> 01:21:29.634
that our love

1526
01:21:30.218 --> 01:21:36.224
and our future together
will be even bigger than Santa Claus.

1527
01:21:47.527 --> 01:21:49.195
Shut the front door.

1528
01:21:51.197 --> 01:21:52.115
Oh.

1529
01:21:57.704 --> 01:21:59.247
Lisa Ann Russell…

1530
01:22:02.042 --> 01:22:03.293
will you marry me?

1531
01:22:08.798 --> 01:22:11.885
I never expected my proposal
to include Santa Claus.

1532
01:22:11.968 --> 01:22:13.011
[laughs]

1533
01:22:13.094 --> 01:22:16.348
-Yes! Yes.
-[Tom] Yes? Oh good.

1534
01:22:16.431 --> 01:22:17.474
[laughing]

1535
01:22:17.557 --> 01:22:18.975
Yes! Whoo!

1536
01:22:19.059 --> 01:22:19.893
[Sharon] Yes!

1537
01:22:21.019 --> 01:22:22.270
[Lisa laughing]

1538
01:22:22.938 --> 01:22:24.564
[Ella] He is real.

1539
01:22:24.648 --> 01:22:25.482
What?

1540
01:22:25.565 --> 01:22:27.025
Santa is real.

1541
01:22:28.568 --> 01:22:30.487
That's what I asked him for.

1542
01:22:30.987 --> 01:22:32.781
That you and Tom would get married.

1543
01:22:32.864 --> 01:22:34.199
And now you're gonna.

1544
01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:37.619
[uplifting music]

1545
01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:45.335
You can't argue with logic like that.

1546
01:22:45.418 --> 01:22:46.461
[giggles]

1547
01:22:50.590 --> 01:22:52.926
Come here. Come here.

1548
01:22:53.009 --> 01:22:55.095
Give me some of that. Aw.

1549
01:22:55.178 --> 01:22:56.596
[Lisa] Oh!

1550
01:22:58.139 --> 01:22:58.974
Boom!

1551
01:22:59.057 --> 01:23:01.267
I did it! I am a man!

1552
01:23:02.477 --> 01:23:05.063
-Ooh! Oh my God. I am sweating.
-You feeling good? Yeah.

1553
01:23:05.146 --> 01:23:06.564
-Every part of me.
-Yeah.
