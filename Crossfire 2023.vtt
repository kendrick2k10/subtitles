3
00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:36.510
So what are your
plans for the summer?

4
00:01:36.648 --> 00:01:38.753
I'm going to Hawaii
with my boyfriend.

5
00:01:40.721 --> 00:01:41.791
That's nice.

6
00:01:43.206 --> 00:01:45.898
My old grandma...
She ruined everything.

7
00:01:46.036 --> 00:01:48.142
Now my whole
savings are gone.

8
00:01:50.351 --> 00:01:53.078
Alisha. I heard your dad
is all over TV

9
00:01:53.216 --> 00:01:54.976
because he finally
rescued those Mexican girls

10
00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.288
from the mafia.

11
00:01:56.426 --> 00:01:58.739
So. now summer
in Tijuana?

12
00:01:58.877 --> 00:02:00.292
You must be excited. right?

13
00:02:02.191 --> 00:02:03.985
Yeah. um...

14
00:02:04.952 --> 00:02:06.781
I don't know. I've...

15
00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:09.577
I've always kept
my distance from him.

16
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.166
He keeps coming.

17
00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:18.310
I would kill for a guy like that
to be my father.

18
00:02:18.862 --> 00:02:20.485
- He's a hero.
-That's true.

19
00:02:20.623 --> 00:02:22.590
and he's super smoky.

20
00:02:23.867 --> 00:02:26.249
I even have my own plans
of going with her to Tijuana.

21
00:02:26.387 --> 00:02:27.940
So. tell us. A.

22
00:02:28.078 --> 00:02:30.322
Why are you really
going with your father?

23
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.668
You tell me!

24
00:02:31.806 --> 00:02:33.222
I'm going with you.

25
00:02:33.912 --> 00:02:35.776
So. you both
are traveling together?

26
00:03:20.234 --> 00:03:21.960
Agent Mark Patson.

27
00:03:22.098 --> 00:03:24.652
Yes. the name seems to be
familiar to most of us.

28
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.447
He's the same Agent Patson

29
00:03:26.585 --> 00:03:28.587
who eliminated
the deadly Gorilla gang

30
00:03:28.725 --> 00:03:30.727
and lost his wife
in the crossfire

31
00:03:30.865 --> 00:03:34.214
with one of the last surviving
gang members.

32
00:03:37.251 --> 00:03:40.323
It took his team some time to
track down the Mexican mafia

33
00:03:40.461 --> 00:03:42.256
who trafficked
these girls across the border--

34
00:03:42.394 --> 00:03:44.672
Well. there he is!

35
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.226
Hey. hey. no!

36
00:03:46.364 --> 00:03:48.158
Don'’t you even start.
Don't do it.

37
00:03:48.297 --> 00:03:51.058
- Hi Agent Mark. Congrats.
- Hey. Sofia. Nice to see you.

38
00:03:51.196 --> 00:03:52.715
Hey. Chris.
How you doing?

39
00:03:52.853 --> 00:03:55.027
You have saved us
from a crisis. Mark.

40
00:03:55.165 --> 00:03:56.650
The nation is proud.

41
00:03:56.788 --> 00:03:59.411
The shot that you took
for such a long distance

42
00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.725
and without any light proved
your perfect skills.

43
00:04:02.863 --> 00:04:05.037
I'm proud to work
under you. Agent Mark.

44
00:04:05.175 --> 00:04:06.901
Well. don't be too proud of me.

45
00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:08.593
Be proud of Tijuana police.
They took the shot.

46
00:04:09.594 --> 00:04:11.768
This is much
interesting to see

47
00:04:11.906 --> 00:04:14.564
than the Gorilla gang
takedown in San Diego.

48
00:04:14.702 --> 00:04:16.773
Good memory for that.
Thanks. Sofia.

49
00:04:16.911 --> 00:04:18.361
You're too kind.

50
00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:20.363
Okay. look.
I appreciate it.

51
00:04:20.501 --> 00:04:22.986
but just get back to what
you all were doing. okay?

52
00:04:23.124 --> 00:04:24.436
- Sir?
- Mm?

53
00:04:24.574 --> 00:04:25.679
Can I have a
quiet word. please?

54
00:04:25.817 --> 00:04:26.990
Sure.

55
00:04:29.579 --> 00:04:31.236
Tijuana police.

56
00:04:31.374 --> 00:04:32.341
Bravo!

57
00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:33.790
Hey. Ivan.

58
00:04:34.239 --> 00:04:35.999
Thanks for
the support. okay?

59
00:04:36.137 --> 00:04:38.623
And then again. honestly.
I just wanna say

60
00:04:38.761 --> 00:04:40.694
I appreciate the support
over the years.

61
00:04:40.832 --> 00:04:42.005
I mean that.

62
00:04:48.115 --> 00:04:49.599
So. what
can I do for you. Mark?

63
00:05:03.475 --> 00:05:05.063
What is this?

64
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:06.961
Is this is a joke?

65
00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:09.067
Come on. Mark. Why now?

66
00:05:09.205 --> 00:05:11.000
Look. I would suggest

67
00:05:11.138 --> 00:05:13.830
that this is not the right time
for early retirement.

68
00:05:14.348 --> 00:05:17.075
With all due respect sir.
I think I've made my decision.

69
00:05:18.248 --> 00:05:19.560
Look. I've been planning this

70
00:05:19.698 --> 00:05:21.700
since Catherine
passed away. John.

71
00:05:21.838 --> 00:05:23.633
Since Alisha
walked out of my life.

72
00:05:24.462 --> 00:05:26.705
Kind of why I
took this particular job.

73
00:05:28.673 --> 00:05:31.261
And I understand. okay? I do.

74
00:05:33.194 --> 00:05:34.886
I'll tell you what;
why don't you take the night

75
00:05:35.024 --> 00:05:37.509
and think about it?
Okay?

76
00:05:41.513 --> 00:05:42.928
You know what?

77
00:05:43.066 --> 00:05:45.103
I realized something
when we reunited

78
00:05:45.241 --> 00:05:48.313
that family
with those little girls.

79
00:05:48.451 --> 00:05:51.558
And. uh. I realized
I'm a horrible father.

80
00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:55.285
I realized I've never
been there for Alisha.

81
00:05:55.424 --> 00:05:57.702
I mean. she blames me
for Catherine's death. John.

82
00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.637
So. you see.
I've got this little...

83
00:06:02.741 --> 00:06:03.949
This little window
of opportunity

84
00:06:04.087 --> 00:06:05.848
to do something right.

85
00:06:05.986 --> 00:06:08.368
Before her hatred washes me
completely from her heart.

86
00:06:08.506 --> 00:06:11.232
And I'm not gonna let
that happen. I'm not.

87
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.270
Hm...

88
00:06:15.547 --> 00:06:17.204
So. what are
your plans for summer now?

89
00:06:19.068 --> 00:06:20.207
Thank you. sir.

90
00:07:40.908 --> 00:07:42.254
Hey.

91
00:07:43.532 --> 00:07:45.188
Okay. who are you
and what are you doing here?

92
00:07:47.328 --> 00:07:49.158
What are you doing--
What are you doing here. buddy?

93
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:51.919
Put your hands
on your head.

94
00:07:52.057 --> 00:07:53.473
Put your hands on your head!

95
00:07:53.611 --> 00:07:55.371
God. Mark!

96
00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:58.029
It's the plumber I brought
to fix the drain. remember?

97
00:07:58.167 --> 00:07:59.479
Oh. Jesus. Miriam.
I'm sorry.

98
00:08:01.273 --> 00:08:02.999
Okay. I don't care.
Wait a minute.

99
00:08:03.137 --> 00:08:04.932
Tell him I wanna
see his passport. Your ID!

100
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:06.486
It's all okay.

101
00:08:11.145 --> 00:08:13.044
He's all good. Mark.

102
00:08:13.182 --> 00:08:14.908
Trust me.
You know me. hon.

103
00:08:16.047 --> 00:08:18.152
I'm sorry. okay?

104
00:08:24.642 --> 00:08:26.506
-I'm sorry. I forgot.
-That's okay.

105
00:08:27.368 --> 00:08:29.129
Pardon. senor.

106
00:08:29.267 --> 00:08:30.820
No problem.

107
00:08:33.374 --> 00:08:36.067
- He speaks perfect English.
- It's okay.

108
00:08:36.205 --> 00:08:38.725
Is it me or did he sound
like he was from Malibu?

109
00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:41.969
What can I get you?

110
00:08:42.107 --> 00:08:43.246
Do you want a coffee?

111
00:08:43.384 --> 00:08:44.593
You're adorable.

112
00:09:24.529 --> 00:09:25.565
Hi.

113
00:09:30.915 --> 00:09:32.848
You haven't changed
that much at all.

114
00:09:34.539 --> 00:09:36.610
I didn't expect
to see you here.

115
00:09:37.991 --> 00:09:40.234
I was planning
to catch a cab.

116
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:44.031
Well. I'm here.

117
00:09:44.894 --> 00:09:46.758
And of course
I'm gonna be here. Alisha.

118
00:09:46.896 --> 00:09:48.933
You're still my daughter
after all. right?

119
00:09:50.313 --> 00:09:52.971
Let's be very clear on this.

120
00:09:54.835 --> 00:09:58.770
I buried all of the memories
I have with you

121
00:09:58.908 --> 00:10:01.255
the day that
I lost my mom.

122
00:10:01.946 --> 00:10:04.224
I'm just here
for my summer vacation.

123
00:10:05.294 --> 00:10:07.986
So let's just stay
out of each other's way

124
00:10:08.642 --> 00:10:10.610
and you can carry
on with your life.

125
00:10:11.507 --> 00:10:13.613
And you let
me do my own thing.

126
00:11:24.891 --> 00:11:26.582
You're sure
you're not coming?

127
00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.274
It's gonna be so much fun!
Please. please. please!

128
00:11:29.412 --> 00:11:31.311
I'm good.
I'm gonna stay here.

129
00:11:31.449 --> 00:11:33.313
Okay. study for me.

130
00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.420
I'll take
a shot for you.

131
00:11:37.558 --> 00:11:39.768
Take four shots.
Everybody take shots.

132
00:11:39.906 --> 00:11:41.839
Okay. let's go. Bye!

133
00:11:43.875 --> 00:11:46.050
- Come on. girls!
- Bye! Have a great night!

134
00:11:46.188 --> 00:11:47.223
Bye.

135
00:11:47.361 --> 00:11:48.431
You too!

136
00:11:49.156 --> 00:11:50.571
Be safe.

137
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.125
And sober! Love you!

138
00:11:52.263 --> 00:11:53.816
Sober.

139
00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:36.652
Do you feel like
stopping for some food?

140
00:12:38.619 --> 00:12:40.138
No.

141
00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:43.832
Well. there's
no food at the house.

142
00:12:45.419 --> 00:12:46.973
I'll tell you what.

143
00:12:47.111 --> 00:12:48.906
I'm gonna stop and get us
a little something. okay?

144
00:13:02.851 --> 00:13:04.369
- Hey. man!
- Hey!

145
00:13:04.507 --> 00:13:05.992
-That's for me. right?
-Yeah.

146
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:07.372
Oh. you guys are fast!

147
00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:10.099
Okay. that's great. Okay.

148
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.619
Do me a favor.
Just give me a...

149
00:13:12.757 --> 00:13:14.207
one latte to go and no sugar.
Okay. boss?

150
00:13:14.345 --> 00:13:15.933
- Yeah.
- Okay.

151
00:13:30.637 --> 00:13:32.190
- Hey!
- Hey!

152
00:13:32.328 --> 00:13:34.468
What are you doing?
This is my friend. Viola!

153
00:13:34.606 --> 00:13:36.022
Oh. geez!
I'm sorry. Alisha!

154
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.678
I... I'm sorry. I...

155
00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:40.198
It's okay.
No need to apologize. I'm fine.

156
00:13:40.336 --> 00:13:41.855
I appreciate
your kindness.

157
00:13:41.993 --> 00:13:43.892
Hey. so I'll see
you after my trip?

158
00:13:44.962 --> 00:13:46.826
It was really nice
meeting you. agent Mark.

159
00:13:46.964 --> 00:13:48.517
I appreciate you.

160
00:13:48.655 --> 00:13:51.002
And good luck
with Stephen.

161
00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:52.693
- Bye!
- See you.

162
00:14:14.888 --> 00:14:16.717
So. who's Stephen?

163
00:14:18.685 --> 00:14:20.376
Don't worry about it.

164
00:14:20.514 --> 00:14:23.069
I worry about everything.
You know that. right?

165
00:14:25.071 --> 00:14:26.520
Is that what I know?

166
00:16:16.354 --> 00:16:17.493
Come on in.

167
00:16:20.772 --> 00:16:22.326
Okay. come on in.
Come on.

168
00:16:23.637 --> 00:16:25.260
This is it.

169
00:16:25.398 --> 00:16:27.020
Built it about
five or six years ago

170
00:16:27.158 --> 00:16:28.711
with a real good friend of mine.

171
00:16:28.849 --> 00:16:30.955
Every stone. the wood.

172
00:16:31.093 --> 00:16:33.406
As I said. there's a story
for everything in this place.

173
00:16:33.544 --> 00:16:34.752
I won't bore you for now.

174
00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:36.547
Plumbing.
we got a little problem.

175
00:16:36.685 --> 00:16:38.859
but you've got hot water.
so that's a good thing. eh?

176
00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:40.930
Your room
is up top there on the left.

177
00:16:41.069 --> 00:16:42.829
Uh. this is it.

178
00:16:42.967 --> 00:16:45.038
What can I say?
Make yourself at home.

179
00:16:45.176 --> 00:16:46.522
- Great.
- Okay?

180
00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.007
Let me help you up with the bag.

181
00:16:48.145 --> 00:16:49.491
I got it. No worries here.

182
00:16:49.629 --> 00:16:50.699
Okay.

183
00:16:53.909 --> 00:16:55.669
Right up to the left.

184
00:16:55.807 --> 00:16:57.188
That's you.

185
00:16:57.326 --> 00:16:58.776
Right.

186
00:16:58.914 --> 00:17:00.467
Okay. anything
you need just let me know.

187
00:17:09.925 --> 00:17:11.340
God damnit.

188
00:17:33.362 --> 00:17:34.915
Give me the mayonnaise. man.

189
00:17:35.813 --> 00:17:36.883
No.

190
00:17:47.031 --> 00:17:48.377
- Dad.
- Mm-hmm?

191
00:17:49.033 --> 00:17:51.898
You know that you're the talk
of the town. right?

192
00:17:52.036 --> 00:17:53.727
Like. all my school

193
00:17:53.865 --> 00:17:55.971
is talking about
the Gorilla gang takedown...

194
00:17:56.109 --> 00:17:58.353
Alisha. Time for school.

195
00:17:59.733 --> 00:18:03.116
And you do know that this is
putting our family at risk?

196
00:18:04.531 --> 00:18:07.224
We're not safe because of you.

197
00:18:07.362 --> 00:18:09.364
And you being
in your limelight.

198
00:18:10.572 --> 00:18:12.505
Like. do you think
about our family at all

199
00:18:12.643 --> 00:18:14.162
when you're out there
saving whoever you're saving?

200
00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:15.818
That's enough. Alisha!

201
00:18:15.956 --> 00:18:17.820
- Of course I do.
- Do you think about us?

202
00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:19.719
Okay. Alisha.
that's enough.

203
00:18:19.857 --> 00:18:21.169
You're gonna be late.

204
00:18:21.307 --> 00:18:22.618
Alisha.

205
00:18:22.756 --> 00:18:23.964
Come on. just give me a second.

206
00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:26.174
It's not that simple.

207
00:18:26.312 --> 00:18:29.522
See you sweetie.
I love you. dear.

208
00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:43.294
I don't know but...

209
00:18:44.295 --> 00:18:45.538
I...

210
00:18:46.332 --> 00:18:48.092
She's right. At the end
of the day. she's right.

211
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:50.439
- No. no. no. no.
-No. she's right.

212
00:18:52.476 --> 00:18:54.167
Oh. man.

213
00:18:55.168 --> 00:18:56.652
You guys are my family.

214
00:18:57.653 --> 00:19:00.069
Maybe she'll see
that one day. but that's it.

215
00:19:00.208 --> 00:19:01.588
You guys are everything to me.

216
00:19:01.726 --> 00:19:03.176
I know.

217
00:19:06.662 --> 00:19:08.181
Why don't we go to the bank?

218
00:19:08.319 --> 00:19:09.527
Sure. okay.

219
00:19:10.632 --> 00:19:11.874
- Okay?
-You got it.

220
00:19:12.012 --> 00:19:13.669
Five minutes?
Okay. let's go.

221
00:19:13.807 --> 00:19:15.361
- To the bank.
- Maybe stop for something

222
00:19:15.499 --> 00:19:17.190
to eat on the way back?
Get some food? Something?

223
00:19:17.328 --> 00:19:18.847
-Okay.
- Okay? Okay.

224
00:19:35.312 --> 00:19:36.761
Okay.

225
00:19:36.899 --> 00:19:38.556
Okay. I'm gonna
go quickly to the bank.

226
00:19:38.694 --> 00:19:40.179
- Gonna get us some money. baby?
- Yeah.

227
00:19:40.317 --> 00:19:42.111
- Yeah? A lot of money?
- Yeah. yeah.

228
00:19:42.871 --> 00:19:44.252
- Okay.
- I'll be back.

229
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:45.874
I'll be here.

230
00:20:56.427 --> 00:20:57.566
Hey. Miriam! Come on in!

231
00:20:57.704 --> 00:20:59.119
Hey. Mark!

232
00:20:59.258 --> 00:21:01.225
Brought you and
Alisha some food tonight.

233
00:21:01.363 --> 00:21:02.813
Ah. thank you.

234
00:21:02.951 --> 00:21:04.849
How kind of you.
Save me some cooking time

235
00:21:04.987 --> 00:21:06.472
'cause you know
how bad I am at cooking.

236
00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:08.128
- No!
- Thanks. sweetheart.

237
00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:09.716
- Yeah.
- I'll tell you what.

238
00:21:09.854 --> 00:21:11.822
Do you have a minute?
She's in her room.

239
00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.100
Think maybe it's a good time
we introduce you to her.

240
00:21:14.238 --> 00:21:16.102
- What do you think?
- I'd love to meet her.

241
00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.000
- I'd love that too. Come on.
- All right.

242
00:21:28.597 --> 00:21:29.667
Yup?

243
00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:31.738
Hey.

244
00:21:33.084 --> 00:21:35.190
So. uh... Hey. look.
Sorry to disturb you.

245
00:21:35.328 --> 00:21:38.193
I just wanted to introduce you
to an old friend of mine. okay?

246
00:21:38.331 --> 00:21:39.988
One of my dearest friends.
Her name is Miriam.

247
00:21:40.126 --> 00:21:41.438
She lives next door.

248
00:21:41.576 --> 00:21:43.302
She's the one who's been
watching over me

249
00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.442
and the house for years.
I just wanted you to say hello.

250
00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:46.788
Hey.

251
00:21:48.755 --> 00:21:50.343
I think we had a deal

252
00:21:50.481 --> 00:21:52.621
that we weren't going
to bother each other.

253
00:21:53.795 --> 00:21:57.039
So. please.
enjoy the day with your friend.

254
00:21:57.177 --> 00:21:58.213
All right.

255
00:21:58.351 --> 00:21:59.697
Hey. Mark.

256
00:21:59.835 --> 00:22:01.492
You know. I left
the hot plate on. hon.

257
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:03.736
Just go and check on that.
Let her rest.

258
00:22:03.874 --> 00:22:05.116
- All right?
- Okay.

259
00:22:05.254 --> 00:22:06.704
It's a pleasure
to meet you. hon.

260
00:22:06.842 --> 00:22:08.188
Nice to meet you.

261
00:23:27.889 --> 00:23:29.166
Off of me!

262
00:24:40.168 --> 00:24:42.170
Hi! Hi. sir!

263
00:24:42.308 --> 00:24:46.001
So. I... Somebody stole
my wallet. basically.

264
00:24:46.139 --> 00:24:47.589
And I need to get home.

265
00:24:47.727 --> 00:24:49.695
But I don't have any
money to give you now.

266
00:24:53.284 --> 00:24:55.010
Okay. I'll give you the money
when I get home.

267
00:24:57.392 --> 00:24:59.187
It's not that far.

268
00:24:59.325 --> 00:25:01.051
We can just
go there and I'll...

269
00:25:01.189 --> 00:25:02.846
I'll give you...

270
00:25:03.881 --> 00:25:05.055
I have...

271
00:25:28.492 --> 00:25:29.769
Hey. so...

272
00:25:29.907 --> 00:25:31.771
I need a ride home.

273
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:35.637
Someone just stole my cell phone
and my wallet and my money.

274
00:25:35.775 --> 00:25:40.228
But I can give you my
money when I get home.

275
00:25:40.366 --> 00:25:41.919
-Sure.
- Okay. uh...

276
00:25:43.093 --> 00:25:44.197
No. we're good.

277
00:25:44.335 --> 00:25:45.647
No. you can go.

278
00:25:45.785 --> 00:25:47.856
You can go!
I'll get the next one.

279
00:25:48.616 --> 00:25:50.272
Sure. we're good.

280
00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:52.551
No. we're good.

281
00:25:52.689 --> 00:25:54.829
I'll drive you.
Just get in.

282
00:25:54.967 --> 00:25:56.037
No.

283
00:25:56.762 --> 00:25:58.557
- All right.
-Hey. hey!

284
00:26:00.248 --> 00:26:02.388
- Alisha?
- Damn it.

285
00:26:02.802 --> 00:26:03.872
Shh!

286
00:26:04.701 --> 00:26:06.288
I'm your neighbor.

287
00:26:06.426 --> 00:26:08.532
Brought you and your dad
food the other night.

288
00:26:10.223 --> 00:26:12.363
What's the matter. baby?
Oh!

289
00:26:24.065 --> 00:26:25.894
I'm sorry
about yesterday.

290
00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.863
I know I
was rude before.

291
00:26:30.174 --> 00:26:31.659
Don't worry about it.

292
00:26:31.797 --> 00:26:33.937
Tell me what you
were doing out there.

293
00:26:35.145 --> 00:26:39.598
Someone pickpocketed my wallet
and I had my cell phone in it.

294
00:26:39.736 --> 00:26:41.082
I tried to call my dad.

295
00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:43.049
but he keeps changing
his number.

296
00:26:43.187 --> 00:26:44.913
And then no taxi

297
00:26:45.051 --> 00:26:47.191
was gonna give me a ride home
without money. and...

298
00:26:48.986 --> 00:26:50.298
Then you showed up.

299
00:26:50.436 --> 00:26:52.921
I'm glad that I did.

300
00:26:53.059 --> 00:26:54.682
Let's tell
your father...

301
00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:58.271
No! Can we just stop
and keep this between us?

302
00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:02.379
I don't wanna
involve him.

303
00:27:02.517 --> 00:27:04.623
At least let
me help find--

304
00:27:04.761 --> 00:27:06.901
Just have your dad
find your cell phone

305
00:27:07.039 --> 00:27:09.248
and your wallet. okay?

306
00:27:09.386 --> 00:27:10.870
That's all.

307
00:27:11.008 --> 00:27:12.113
That's all we're gonna tell him.

308
00:27:12.251 --> 00:27:13.424
Okay.

309
00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:16.496
Hey. Mark!

310
00:27:16.635 --> 00:27:18.360
Yes. I'm out
with Alisha. baby.

311
00:27:18.498 --> 00:27:19.810
We went shopping.

312
00:27:19.948 --> 00:27:21.812
Oh. yes. yes.

313
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:24.539
While we were shopping

314
00:27:24.677 --> 00:27:27.197
she misplaced her
cell phone and wallet.

315
00:27:27.335 --> 00:27:28.819
Can you
find it. please?

316
00:27:28.957 --> 00:27:31.132
Perfect.

317
00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:32.892
We'll be home soon.

318
00:27:34.238 --> 00:27:36.551
See? It's okay.

319
00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:46.803
Alisha. baby.
it looks great.

320
00:27:46.941 --> 00:27:48.183
I hope you like it.

321
00:27:48.321 --> 00:27:49.495
I know we will.

322
00:27:49.633 --> 00:27:51.428
I know your dad will too.

323
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:56.675
Thank you for today.

324
00:27:56.813 --> 00:28:00.679
No. I'm just glad
I was there for you. baby.

325
00:28:03.716 --> 00:28:04.752
Hey. guys.

326
00:28:06.995 --> 00:28:09.204
- So...
-That was quick.

327
00:28:09.342 --> 00:28:11.897
Hey. what can I say?
I know a few people.

328
00:28:12.898 --> 00:28:15.935
Some guy called Stephen has been
ringing for you. over and over.

329
00:28:16.073 --> 00:28:17.903
Maybe you should call him back
and tell him you're okay.

330
00:28:18.041 --> 00:28:20.215
Maybe I should
do that. definitely.

331
00:28:20.353 --> 00:28:21.907
Thanks.

332
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:30.847
Miriam.
who's this Stephen guy?

333
00:28:30.985 --> 00:28:33.056
I was gonna ask
you the same thing.

334
00:28:33.194 --> 00:28:35.196
But I was gonna
ask you the same thing.

335
00:28:35.334 --> 00:28:36.853
Mark. you...

336
00:28:38.786 --> 00:28:40.788
Cheers. love. Thanks for dinner.
Who made this?

337
00:28:40.926 --> 00:28:42.237
-Your baby.
- She made it?

338
00:28:42.375 --> 00:28:44.101
She did.

339
00:28:46.103 --> 00:28:48.623
I cannot wait
to see you. babe.

340
00:28:48.761 --> 00:28:50.590
See you soon.

341
00:28:50.729 --> 00:28:52.627
See you soon.

342
00:28:58.184 --> 00:29:00.255
What if I say
I have a boyfriend?

343
00:29:00.393 --> 00:29:01.705
But...

344
00:29:01.843 --> 00:29:03.914
You don't. so... It's just us.

345
00:29:05.019 --> 00:29:06.710
Us?

346
00:29:06.848 --> 00:29:09.471
Seems like you've already made
my decision for me.

347
00:29:09.609 --> 00:29:11.784
Of course!
I'm confident.

348
00:29:14.028 --> 00:29:15.892
So...?

349
00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:18.066
What are your plans
for this summer?

350
00:29:19.378 --> 00:29:22.346
I am making my
bucket list as we speak.

351
00:29:24.797 --> 00:29:26.765
I hope that you're
adding me to that list.

352
00:29:28.145 --> 00:29:29.388
Maybe.

353
00:29:30.458 --> 00:29:32.115
We just have to plan it.

354
00:29:46.923 --> 00:29:49.028
Now. let's say
grace really quick.

355
00:29:49.166 --> 00:29:50.892
I've got to watch
my favorite program. okay?

356
00:29:52.169 --> 00:29:53.515
Please.

357
00:29:53.653 --> 00:29:54.723
Dear Lord in Heaven.

358
00:29:56.277 --> 00:29:58.037
bless this food
we're about to receive.

359
00:29:58.175 --> 00:30:00.212
Bless everybody
in this house.

360
00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:04.423
Please. bless some will forgive
others for all their craziness.

361
00:30:04.561 --> 00:30:05.665
Amen.

362
00:30:05.804 --> 00:30:07.184
Amen.

363
00:30:07.322 --> 00:30:09.048
Your baby made this.

364
00:30:09.186 --> 00:30:10.360
You made this?

365
00:30:10.498 --> 00:30:12.189
I made it. yeah.

366
00:30:12.327 --> 00:30:14.813
-You can cook?
- I can.

367
00:30:14.951 --> 00:30:16.538
You're not an eater.
but you can cook.

368
00:30:16.676 --> 00:30:18.402
How does
that work. Miriam?

369
00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:21.198
I mean. usually people
that like to cook like to eat.

370
00:30:21.336 --> 00:30:22.821
I don't know.
Let's see what you got. kid.

371
00:30:22.959 --> 00:30:24.650
Had to learn a thing
or two on my own.

372
00:30:24.788 --> 00:30:26.169
I'm sure you did.

373
00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:50.124
- Hi.
-Hi. babe.

374
00:30:50.262 --> 00:30:52.436
I couldn't stop thinking about
you since last time we talk.

375
00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:56.095
Yeah.
It's been a long 30 minutes.

376
00:30:56.233 --> 00:30:57.959
Well.
for you it's been 30 minutes.

377
00:30:58.097 --> 00:31:00.375
for me it feels like a year.

378
00:31:00.513 --> 00:31:02.274
Time freezes.

379
00:31:02.412 --> 00:31:04.207
Oh. only when
I'm talking with you.

380
00:31:06.899 --> 00:31:08.832
So. I was thinking...

381
00:31:09.937 --> 00:31:11.870
What would you like
to do when we see each other?

382
00:31:14.424 --> 00:31:16.909
Ah. Stephen. Let me call you
back in a second.

383
00:31:27.575 --> 00:31:28.576
Dad.

384
00:31:57.432 --> 00:31:58.675
I'm okay.

385
00:32:03.645 --> 00:32:05.268
It's not the first time.

386
00:32:05.406 --> 00:32:06.476
Okay.

387
00:32:06.614 --> 00:32:08.374
That's enough. Dad.

388
00:32:12.896 --> 00:32:13.862
Okay.

389
00:32:14.001 --> 00:32:15.243
You were right.

390
00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:18.419
It's all my fault.

391
00:32:20.766 --> 00:32:22.423
It's all my fault that...

392
00:32:23.286 --> 00:32:24.839
Agent...

393
00:32:24.977 --> 00:32:26.945
Good old Patson...

394
00:32:29.775 --> 00:32:32.536
I can't
even find this...

395
00:32:32.674 --> 00:32:35.608
shooter who killed my wife.

396
00:32:43.962 --> 00:32:45.377
I am a complete failure.

397
00:32:48.035 --> 00:32:49.553
I'm sorry.

398
00:32:49.691 --> 00:32:51.659
I really. really...

399
00:32:52.487 --> 00:32:53.972
I'm sorry.

400
00:33:07.502 --> 00:33:09.677
You're gonna
go to sleep now.

401
00:35:21.774 --> 00:35:23.121
Good morning. Miriam.

402
00:35:24.501 --> 00:35:26.331
Oh. look who's up.

403
00:35:26.469 --> 00:35:28.160
Yeah.

404
00:35:28.816 --> 00:35:30.197
Hey. I appreciate
this. thanks.

405
00:35:30.335 --> 00:35:32.060
Oh. it's not me.

406
00:35:32.199 --> 00:35:35.063
Alisha did that and she took
care of you last night.

407
00:35:36.927 --> 00:35:38.032
Yeah.

408
00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:39.516
And where is she?

409
00:35:39.654 --> 00:35:41.208
Oh. she just
went for a run. honey.

410
00:35:41.346 --> 00:35:42.830
She'll be back soon.

411
00:35:42.968 --> 00:35:44.797
Miriam. didn't I
tell you not to leave her alone?

412
00:35:44.935 --> 00:35:47.110
That's the one thing I asked
you. not to leave her alone.

413
00:35:47.248 --> 00:35:48.698
Mark. you didn't think

414
00:35:48.836 --> 00:35:50.665
I was gonna go running with her.
did you?

415
00:35:50.803 --> 00:35:52.150
Come on.

416
00:36:13.309 --> 00:36:15.242
Oh. there she is.

417
00:36:15.794 --> 00:36:16.967
Come say hello-- what...?

418
00:36:18.003 --> 00:36:19.591
What?

419
00:36:19.729 --> 00:36:22.076
Baby girl. what
happened? Come over here.

420
00:36:22.214 --> 00:36:23.388
Oh. my God.

421
00:36:23.526 --> 00:36:24.699
What happened?

422
00:36:25.355 --> 00:36:27.185
Mark. Mark.
Get me the first aid kit.

423
00:36:27.323 --> 00:36:28.841
- Jesus!
- Mark. please.

424
00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:32.224
It's alright.

425
00:36:32.362 --> 00:36:33.743
No. it's not.

426
00:36:33.881 --> 00:36:35.262
Hold it like this. baby.

427
00:36:36.608 --> 00:36:37.850
- Okay.
-Thank you.

428
00:36:37.988 --> 00:36:39.369
Give me a look at this.

429
00:36:39.507 --> 00:36:40.853
I wanna
know what happened.

430
00:36:40.991 --> 00:36:42.234
Tell me--
I wanna know what happened!

431
00:36:42.372 --> 00:36:43.856
Tell me what happened right now.

432
00:36:46.825 --> 00:36:49.552
Please. tell us what happened.

433
00:36:50.932 --> 00:36:52.417
I don't know. I was...

434
00:36:52.555 --> 00:36:54.108
Running and...

435
00:36:54.246 --> 00:36:56.800
There was this guy who
tried to hit me. so...

436
00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:59.251
Do you remember
anything about the man?

437
00:36:59.389 --> 00:37:01.874
The vehicle. any numbers.
any body features of the driver?

438
00:37:02.012 --> 00:37:03.428
Come on. Mark.

439
00:37:03.566 --> 00:37:05.119
She's not gonna
remember any of that.

440
00:37:05.257 --> 00:37:08.640
A-L-A-15-0-1-A.

441
00:37:08.778 --> 00:37:10.711
It was a man
with a black hood.

442
00:37:10.849 --> 00:37:13.300
And a jacket.
Mid-forties.

443
00:37:13.438 --> 00:37:14.680
Right-handed.

444
00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:20.893
Never got that shit
from my dad's DNA.

445
00:37:23.102 --> 00:37:24.828
Hey. Victor.
It's Mark.

446
00:37:24.966 --> 00:37:27.417
Do me a favor.
Run a number on a plate for me.

447
00:37:27.555 --> 00:37:30.144
ALA-15-0-1-A.

448
00:37:30.282 --> 00:37:31.559
Yeah. you got it.

449
00:37:55.445 --> 00:37:57.136
So. office
came back with word

450
00:37:57.275 --> 00:37:59.553
that the fake plate
your daughter talked about

451
00:37:59.691 --> 00:38:00.899
actually belongs
to a rookie

452
00:38:01.037 --> 00:38:02.832
who does low-end
drug peddling.

453
00:38:03.626 --> 00:38:05.179
He reported
it missing last week.

454
00:38:05.317 --> 00:38:06.801
But it turns out
he's the one that stole

455
00:38:06.939 --> 00:38:08.803
and put the fake plate on it.

456
00:38:08.941 --> 00:38:11.358
On top of that. the night
before there's a robbery.

457
00:38:11.496 --> 00:38:13.877
Same place. same location.
same vehicle.

458
00:38:14.015 --> 00:38:15.500
Just merely
a coincidence.

459
00:38:15.638 --> 00:38:17.295
I mean. we are on it. but...

460
00:38:17.433 --> 00:38:19.297
I don't think it has
anything to do with your family.

461
00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:23.577
Let's hope so.

462
00:38:24.129 --> 00:38:25.889
Yeah.
We're on it. though.

463
00:38:26.027 --> 00:38:28.236
so if you need anything.
just let me know.

464
00:38:28.375 --> 00:38:29.893
Thanks for coming out. Victor.

465
00:38:30.031 --> 00:38:31.619
- It's a pleasure.
- Okay.

466
00:38:33.172 --> 00:38:34.622
- See you.
- All right.

467
00:38:41.802 --> 00:38:43.217
Who's that?

468
00:38:43.493 --> 00:38:46.841
That's Victor.
He works with your father.

469
00:38:46.979 --> 00:38:50.120
I believe it's about the license
plate number you gave him.

470
00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:54.228
You guys
ready to do some shooting?

471
00:38:54.366 --> 00:38:57.714
Your dad also mentioned possibly
going to the shooting range.

472
00:38:57.852 --> 00:38:59.267
Won't that be fun?

473
00:39:01.062 --> 00:39:03.030
Maybe we can
hit the beach after.

474
00:39:03.996 --> 00:39:05.343
Super cool.

475
00:39:08.207 --> 00:39:10.037
Let's go kill
us something. babe.

476
00:39:22.083 --> 00:39:24.189
Let me ask you a question.
What do they call you?

477
00:39:24.327 --> 00:39:26.018
- Uh. Big Mike.
- Big Mike.

478
00:39:26.156 --> 00:39:27.882
Okay. Big Mike.
here's the deal.

479
00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:30.229
If that sink isn't fixed
by the time we're back.

480
00:39:30.368 --> 00:39:31.852
I'm taking you to jail.

481
00:39:55.496 --> 00:39:56.532
You're
getting there.

482
00:39:57.567 --> 00:39:59.535
You're getting
there. Miriam.

483
00:39:59.673 --> 00:40:01.433
Let's see what you've got.

484
00:40:02.676 --> 00:40:04.850
I want you to
listen to something. okay?

485
00:40:04.988 --> 00:40:06.749
The only person
in this life that you think

486
00:40:06.887 --> 00:40:09.786
you can trust other than
yourself is me.

487
00:40:09.924 --> 00:40:11.754
Because
I'm your father.

488
00:40:11.892 --> 00:40:14.412
and I would never do anything
to hurt you. you understand?

489
00:40:31.498 --> 00:40:34.742

- Brace yourselves!
-Dad!

511
00:42:59.369 --> 00:43:01.371
God! Shit!

512
00:43:19.148 --> 00:43:20.667
Yeah.

513
00:43:47.832 --> 00:43:49.074
She'll be fine.

514
00:43:49.212 --> 00:43:50.317
-Really?
-Yes.

515
00:44:37.985 --> 00:44:39.193
Hey.

516
00:44:39.987 --> 00:44:41.195
How's she doing?

517
00:44:43.094 --> 00:44:45.027
We'll see.
I hope she's okay.

518
00:44:45.993 --> 00:44:47.339
Look. uh...

519
00:44:48.409 --> 00:44:50.342
They found a bunch
of needles in the wheel.

520
00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:51.861
Tore it apart.

521
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.553
It's all we got.

522
00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:58.005
- Thanks. Victor.
- Yeah.

523
00:44:58.143 --> 00:44:59.904
This ain't
no coincidence.

524
00:45:00.836 --> 00:45:02.354
You're right.

525
00:45:02.492 --> 00:45:03.666
Hope she
gets better soon.

526
00:45:03.804 --> 00:45:05.116
She'll be okay.

527
00:45:05.254 --> 00:45:06.773
- Good. All right.
- I'll see you.

528
00:45:06.911 --> 00:45:08.740
- Okay.
- Thanks. man.

529
00:45:42.015 --> 00:45:44.638
Sir. Sir!

530
00:45:44.776 --> 00:45:46.536
This area is restricted.
I'm sorry. you cannot enter.

531
00:45:46.674 --> 00:45:48.607
Man. we don't need to do this.
Just come with me.

532
00:46:39.831 --> 00:46:41.522
I miss...

533
00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:43.662
My mom.

534
00:46:46.734 --> 00:46:50.462
I haven't been
in a hospital since...

535
00:46:55.709 --> 00:46:57.366
I'll tell
you a little story

536
00:46:57.504 --> 00:46:59.333
about when
I was in the hospital.

537
00:47:00.645 --> 00:47:02.164
When I met your mother.

538
00:47:03.648 --> 00:47:05.098
You might like it.

539
00:47:07.376 --> 00:47:08.826
It's about
meeting your mom.

540
00:47:12.588 --> 00:47:13.865
Back in '91.

541
00:47:17.006 --> 00:47:20.182
I was special forces
during the Gulf War. and...

542
00:47:21.528 --> 00:47:22.598
I got shot.

543
00:47:24.565 --> 00:47:27.154
So they take me
to this medical clinic.

544
00:47:28.673 --> 00:47:31.503
It's a military hospital.

545
00:47:31.641 --> 00:47:33.402
And it was in tangent

546
00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:36.474
with this cancer treatment
facility. right?

547
00:47:40.167 --> 00:47:41.997
They're tending to my wound.

548
00:47:43.653 --> 00:47:45.414
I look up. and there she is.

549
00:47:46.518 --> 00:47:48.451
Tall.

550
00:47:48.589 --> 00:47:50.246
Bald.

551
00:47:50.384 --> 00:47:52.283
Proud and...

552
00:47:53.491 --> 00:47:54.561
Beautiful.

553
00:47:56.459 --> 00:47:58.772
She was telling the clerk how
she didn't have any money

554
00:47:58.910 --> 00:48:01.361
to make her payments for the
next three or four treatments.

555
00:48:03.052 --> 00:48:05.399
And how she wouldn't be alive

556
00:48:07.367 --> 00:48:09.576
if she didn't
get the treatments.

557
00:48:11.854 --> 00:48:14.201
I had a little
money back then so I. uh.

558
00:48:15.823 --> 00:48:17.618
I took care of the payments.

559
00:48:18.757 --> 00:48:20.656
She got her treatments.

560
00:48:21.588 --> 00:48:23.901
Little did I know that...

561
00:48:25.281 --> 00:48:27.352
at that time.
who knew that that woman.

562
00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:30.114
that big. bald. beautiful woman

563
00:48:30.252 --> 00:48:32.150
would end up becoming
my whole life.

564
00:48:42.022 --> 00:48:43.575
Can I ask you something?

565
00:48:44.783 --> 00:48:45.888
Sure.

566
00:48:47.545 --> 00:48:49.271
Who's that person

567
00:48:50.341 --> 00:48:52.446
in the photo.
with the distorted face.

568
00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:57.451
You know.

569
00:48:59.005 --> 00:49:01.800
The one you keep
with the newspaper cuttings

570
00:49:01.939 --> 00:49:03.871
of mom's death.

571
00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:10.223
I'm gonna check you out
and get you home.

572
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.415
Alisha. baby.

573
00:50:05.312 --> 00:50:06.865
It's my family.

574
00:50:09.351 --> 00:50:10.662
I miss them a lot.

575
00:50:12.354 --> 00:50:13.631
You must be.

576
00:50:15.357 --> 00:50:18.049
Yeah. but that's when
Mark came and...

577
00:50:18.187 --> 00:50:20.086
And then he brought you.

578
00:50:20.224 --> 00:50:22.536
Now the void is gone.

579
00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:25.919
I feel like
I have a family again.

580
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:31.683
Oh. it's okay. baby.

581
00:50:32.443 --> 00:50:34.755
But why are you
dressed like this?

582
00:50:35.722 --> 00:50:38.380
My friend Viola
wants me to hang out with her

583
00:50:38.518 --> 00:50:40.865
but I don't think...

584
00:50:41.003 --> 00:50:43.178
Yeah. you're right.
Your father will not let you go.

585
00:50:43.316 --> 00:50:44.834
Yeah. so
if you could...

586
00:50:49.529 --> 00:50:52.014
Only if you promise
to take me to church tomorrow.

587
00:50:52.152 --> 00:50:53.360
Done.

588
00:50:53.498 --> 00:50:55.190
Fine. I'll cover for you.

589
00:50:56.743 --> 00:50:58.400
Oh. these kids.

590
00:51:13.932 --> 00:51:15.279
Should have been there by now.

591
00:51:15.417 --> 00:51:17.074
Yeah. I know but...

592
00:51:17.212 --> 00:51:19.559
What does it matter?
They're in the club already.

593
00:51:19.697 --> 00:51:21.423
Like they're three guys.

594
00:51:21.561 --> 00:51:23.494
My friends have been waiting
for me. I should be there.

595
00:51:23.632 --> 00:51:25.392
Yeah. I don't care
about your friends.

596
00:51:26.669 --> 00:51:28.361
What. should I care
about your friend then?

597
00:51:28.499 --> 00:51:30.328
Yeah.

598
00:51:30.466 --> 00:51:32.606
It's the first time you
meet her. She's my best friend.

599
00:51:33.849 --> 00:51:35.195
I really hope it's worth it.

600
00:51:35.333 --> 00:51:37.128
- Yeah.
- I really do.

601
00:51:38.164 --> 00:51:39.475
Yeah. here she comes.

602
00:51:47.449 --> 00:51:49.934
- Hey. baby! How are you?
- Hey guys.

603
00:51:50.072 --> 00:51:52.143
Meet the boy
of my life. Raul.

604
00:51:52.281 --> 00:51:54.628
Raul. meet Alisha.
She's my best friend. okay?

605
00:51:56.837 --> 00:51:58.805
We've gotta go.
We've gotta go.

606
00:52:13.889 --> 00:52:15.166
Here we are.

607
00:52:15.304 --> 00:52:16.650
This is the place.

608
00:52:16.788 --> 00:52:18.825
You brought me
to see naked ladies?

609
00:52:18.963 --> 00:52:20.378
Like. with your girlfriend?

610
00:52:20.516 --> 00:52:21.793
It wasn't my first place.

611
00:52:21.931 --> 00:52:23.450
Why would you do that?

612
00:52:23.588 --> 00:52:25.625
Have you been
to places like this?

613
00:52:25.763 --> 00:52:26.798
No.

614
00:52:26.936 --> 00:52:28.248
This place's so good.

615
00:52:28.386 --> 00:52:29.629
It's the best place
on the block.

616
00:52:29.767 --> 00:52:31.355
Well. it's uh...

617
00:52:31.493 --> 00:52:33.219
Let's have fun.

618
00:52:33.357 --> 00:52:36.429
Yeah. absolutely.
Let's get some shots. Shots?

619
00:52:36.567 --> 00:52:38.016
Can you freshen
up this hookah for me?

620
00:52:38.155 --> 00:52:39.880
Yeah. definitely.

621
00:52:40.018 --> 00:52:41.399
Do you have a cigarette?

622
00:52:41.537 --> 00:52:43.194
Yo! That's my boy.

623
00:52:43.332 --> 00:52:45.403
- Hey. Joseph!
- Hey!

624
00:52:45.541 --> 00:52:46.922
Give me two seconds.

625
00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:51.513
Yeah.
Hey. do you have a cigarette?

626
00:52:51.651 --> 00:52:54.343
So how are you feeling
about this place?

627
00:52:54.481 --> 00:52:56.242
What?

628
00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:58.175
You know I don't
like him for you. right?

629
00:52:59.969 --> 00:53:01.557
He says he's changed.

630
00:53:01.695 --> 00:53:03.904
Yeah. He says.
but apparently he hasn't.

631
00:53:04.802 --> 00:53:06.321
He loves me.

632
00:53:08.219 --> 00:53:09.738
I can handle him.

633
00:53:11.567 --> 00:53:13.086
I can handle him. I swear.

634
00:53:14.570 --> 00:53:16.158
It's okay. I'm okay.

635
00:53:16.296 --> 00:53:18.229
We are here to party.

636
00:53:18.367 --> 00:53:19.575
Get in the mood.

637
00:53:25.202 --> 00:53:27.514
Make some space.
Make some space.

638
00:53:27.652 --> 00:53:29.930
Make some space. There!

639
00:53:31.622 --> 00:53:33.486
Okay. here I got Joseph.

00:53:47.845 --> 00:53:50.468
Ah. well. well.
Let's get this party going.

643
00:53:53.126 --> 00:53:54.955
No way. guys.
I don't do drugs.

644
00:53:55.093 --> 00:53:56.647
What do you mean
you don't do drugs?

645
00:53:56.785 --> 00:53:58.683
It's okay. it's fine.
You're here with me.

00:53:58.821 --> 00:54:00.789
Let's do this.

00:54:00.927 --> 00:54:02.825
We're here together.
nothing is going to happen.

648
00:54:02.963 --> 00:54:04.413
Don't worry. don't worry.

649
00:54:04.551 --> 00:54:06.001
Trust me.
You're here with me.

650
00:54:07.036 --> 00:54:09.073
Okay? Let's do this. eh?

00:55:36.850 --> 00:55:38.024
Hey. Where were you?

658
00:55:38.162 --> 00:55:39.922
- I was--
- I was in the bathroom.

659
00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:41.924
- Where is Viola?
- Ah. don't worry about it.

660
00:55:42.062 --> 00:55:44.686
- Come on. Give me a kiss.
- Stop.

661
00:55:46.170 --> 00:55:48.414
I said stop.

662
00:56:03.152 --> 00:56:04.568
What the fuck?

663
00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:07.916
Oh. my God!

664
00:56:32.492 --> 00:56:33.873
Who the fuck are you?

665
00:57:00.209 --> 00:57:01.901
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

666
00:57:02.039 --> 00:57:04.248
It's okay. Let's go.

667
00:57:04.386 --> 00:57:06.284
- It's okay
-I'm sorry.

668
00:57:35.797 --> 00:57:37.419
Hey...

669
00:57:39.628 --> 00:57:41.285
I'm sorry.

670
00:57:42.769 --> 00:57:44.530
What would've
happened if your dad

671
00:57:44.668 --> 00:57:46.463
wouldn't have gotten there
on time?

672
00:57:48.948 --> 00:57:49.983
I'm so sorry.

673
00:57:53.711 --> 00:57:55.195
It's okay.

674
00:58:06.379 --> 00:58:08.208
Okay. the car is here.
I have to go.

675
00:58:08.346 --> 00:58:10.763
Are you gonna see me tomorrow?
Are we gonna see each other?

676
00:58:10.901 --> 00:58:12.937
Yes. we're gonna see each other
tomorrow. Every day.

677
00:58:13.075 --> 00:58:14.387
Every day. yes.

678
00:58:16.562 --> 00:58:18.736
Okay. thank you
so much for being there.

679
00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:21.394
I love you.

680
00:58:23.361 --> 00:58:26.054
Okay? I'll see
you tomorrow. okay? Thanks.

681
00:58:47.247 --> 00:58:48.594
I'm so sorry.

682
00:58:48.732 --> 00:58:50.734
It was not her fault.
It was all mine.

683
00:58:50.872 --> 00:58:52.459
It's okay.
Don't worry about it.

684
00:58:52.598 --> 00:58:54.565
I did a lot worse
when I was your age.

685
00:58:56.740 --> 00:58:59.087
Okay? Just don't it again.

686
00:58:59.225 --> 00:59:00.675
Okay? You're a good kid.

687
00:59:00.813 --> 00:59:02.228
And I like you being
her best friend.

688
00:59:02.366 --> 00:59:03.747
You're good for each other.

689
00:59:03.885 --> 00:59:05.162
You get that. right?

690
00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:07.026
- Yes.
- Okay.

691
00:59:07.164 --> 00:59:08.924
Now. if there's
anything you need.

692
00:59:09.062 --> 00:59:10.374
you let me know.

693
00:59:10.512 --> 00:59:12.065
All right?

694
00:59:18.727 --> 00:59:20.108
And I'm never drinking again.

695
00:59:20.246 --> 00:59:21.730
Me too.

696
00:59:23.214 --> 00:59:25.700
Okay. Look after her.
See you.

697
00:59:53.348 --> 00:59:55.937
Whoa. whoa. Wait a minute.
Where are you guys going?

698
00:59:56.075 --> 00:59:57.490
Miriam. do you
have a minute. please?

699
00:59:57.628 --> 00:59:59.181
I wanna talk to
you guys about something.

700
00:59:59.319 --> 01:00:00.838
Yes. of course. Mark.

701
01:00:00.976 --> 01:00:03.082
But now I need
to speak to God.

702
01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:05.325
Talk to God. okay.
Can he wait five minutes. maybe?

703
01:00:05.463 --> 01:00:07.673
- What do you think?
- Oh. honey. you know me.

704
01:00:07.811 --> 01:00:09.260
I don't let God wait.

705
01:00:09.398 --> 01:00:10.710
Take me to
church. Alisha.

706
01:00:40.291 --> 01:00:43.053
Yeah. After. you know...

707
01:00:43.191 --> 01:00:47.402
I lost my family.
and your dad...

708
01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:49.646
He came in for me.

709
01:00:49.784 --> 01:00:51.544
Became my family.

710
01:00:51.682 --> 01:00:53.650
Took care
of everything.

711
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:25.785
Who was that?

712
01:01:25.923 --> 01:01:28.892
Oh. her son
had a terrible accident.

713
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:30.583
She couldn't pay for it.

714
01:01:30.721 --> 01:01:33.068
Your father.
he took care of everything.

715
01:01:33.206 --> 01:01:35.761
And now her son is
going to the nationals.

716
01:01:35.899 --> 01:01:37.694
Isn't that great?

717
01:01:43.561 --> 01:01:45.356
I think we
should head home.

718
01:01:45.494 --> 01:01:48.946
Ah. okay. First. let
me stop at the office.

719
01:01:49.084 --> 01:01:50.741
You have an office?

720
01:01:52.743 --> 01:01:54.193
Of course
I have an office.

721
01:01:54.331 --> 01:01:55.608
Let's go.

722
01:02:13.488 --> 01:02:15.145
This is Alisha.

723
01:02:15.283 --> 01:02:17.768
Alisha. this is Juana.
She takes care of the place.

724
01:02:29.469 --> 01:02:31.092
Okay. okay.
I'll take care of that.

725
01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:32.610
I'll have to take
a phone call. hon.

726
01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:34.440
You just go ahead
and look around.

727
01:02:34.578 --> 01:02:36.373
Juana will take
care of you. okay?

728
01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:54.658
So how did you become
involved in this place?

729
01:03:54.796 --> 01:03:56.522
This organization?

730
01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:59.732
It was handed
down to my husband.

731
01:03:59.870 --> 01:04:01.630
And...

732
01:04:01.768 --> 01:04:06.497
My husband put his blood. sweat.
and tears into this place.

733
01:04:06.635 --> 01:04:08.983
But after his passing.

734
01:04:10.294 --> 01:04:11.917
it all went down.

735
01:04:12.055 --> 01:04:14.436
Your father

736
01:04:14.574 --> 01:04:18.371
came in. financed us...

737
01:04:18.509 --> 01:04:21.996
He's the most
noble man that I know.

738
01:04:22.134 --> 01:04:24.791
That's why. Alisha baby.

739
01:04:24.930 --> 01:04:29.417
you know deep down in your heart

740
01:04:29.555 --> 01:04:32.799
he's not to blame
for any of this.

741
01:04:55.615 --> 01:04:58.273
Well. well. well.
Look who has an appetite.

742
01:05:01.242 --> 01:05:03.623
I'm going to the store.
You need anything?

743
01:05:06.937 --> 01:05:08.180
No. I don't think so.

744
01:05:08.318 --> 01:05:09.388
Okay.

745
01:05:10.976 --> 01:05:12.563
Enjoy your sandwich.

746
01:05:28.614 --> 01:05:30.029
Expecting something?

747
01:05:30.167 --> 01:05:31.513
No.

748
01:05:31.651 --> 01:05:33.343
It's got your name on it.

749
01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:37.278
See you.

750
01:06:00.335 --> 01:06:02.199
Expecting something?

751
01:06:02.337 --> 01:06:03.683
No.

752
01:06:03.821 --> 01:06:05.099
It's got your name on it.

753
01:06:20.114 --> 01:06:21.529
Hey.

754
01:06:22.461 --> 01:06:24.083
My keys...

755
01:06:24.221 --> 01:06:26.223
Where are my keys?
Did I leave my keys somewhere?

756
01:06:26.361 --> 01:06:28.018
No. you took your keys with you.

757
01:06:28.156 --> 01:06:30.124
-Are you sure?
- I saw you do it.

758
01:06:33.748 --> 01:06:36.578
I got the keys. right?
Yeah. I got the keys. Okay.

759
01:06:57.323 --> 01:06:59.981
- How you doing. Mark?
- Hey. John.

760
01:07:00.119 --> 01:07:02.018
Hey. Victor.
Thanks for coming. guys.

761
01:07:04.158 --> 01:07:06.263
I want you
guys to check this out.

762
01:07:06.401 --> 01:07:07.851
What's this?

763
01:07:09.887 --> 01:07:12.476
Look. I don't
see anything unusual.

764
01:07:12.614 --> 01:07:13.788
Same thing as last time.

765
01:07:13.926 --> 01:07:16.342
Right. look. Okay. I get that.

766
01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:18.551
You remember the guy
that ran Alisha off the road

767
01:07:18.689 --> 01:07:20.415
in his car. right?

768
01:07:20.553 --> 01:07:22.762
Okay. apparently this guy
was wearing a black hoodie.

769
01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:24.557
Look. so what?
We already investigated this.

770
01:07:24.695 --> 01:07:25.869
It's a false alarm.

771
01:07:26.007 --> 01:07:28.044
Keep watching. John.

772
01:07:28.182 --> 01:07:30.322
Okay. I made
a slight edit on the tape.

773
01:07:32.082 --> 01:07:33.497
You see that?

774
01:07:33.635 --> 01:07:35.879
This guy has been
circling our house. John.

775
01:07:36.017 --> 01:07:38.123
At least
seven to ten times.

776
01:07:38.261 --> 01:07:40.504
There's no
reports of him stopping nearby.

777
01:07:40.642 --> 01:07:42.610
This is not a coincidence.

778
01:07:42.748 --> 01:07:44.439
This guy is circling our house.

779
01:07:44.577 --> 01:07:46.924
- You do understand?
- Yeah. Yeah. we get it.

780
01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:48.892
We get it. You know what?

781
01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:50.618
You may be onto something.

782
01:07:50.756 --> 01:07:52.309
We're gonna look into it.
All right?

783
01:07:52.447 --> 01:07:54.311
- I appreciate that.
-Don't worry. We got this.

784
01:07:54.449 --> 01:07:55.795
Okay. You got it. John.

785
01:07:55.933 --> 01:07:57.211
Thanks for coming again.

786
01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:58.729
- Victor. thank you.
- Okay.

787
01:08:11.811 --> 01:08:13.848
Hi.

788
01:08:13.986 --> 01:08:16.126
Hi. babe.
How you doing?

789
01:08:18.784 --> 01:08:20.268
Guess where I'm at.

790
01:08:22.063 --> 01:08:24.134
You're not close. are you?

791
01:08:24.272 --> 01:08:26.826
Well. I'll be outside
your door in five minutes.

792
01:08:26.964 --> 01:08:29.864
No. Stephen.
I have to tell my dad something.

793
01:08:30.002 --> 01:08:31.831
Come on. I'll be there
in five minutes. Don't worry.

794
01:08:31.969 --> 01:08:33.557
No. I have to tell...

795
01:08:35.732 --> 01:08:37.837
Oh. God.

796
01:08:42.290 --> 01:08:43.981
- Dad?
- Hey. what's up?

797
01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.983
Well. Viola was--

798
01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:48.020
Hold that thought.
just one second.

799
01:08:48.158 --> 01:08:49.228
What's up?

800
01:08:49.366 --> 01:08:51.057
- Viola...
- Hold on!

801
01:08:51.196 --> 01:08:52.818
Yeah. what is it?

802
01:08:52.956 --> 01:08:54.302
Mark. you won't
believe this.

803
01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:55.510
Check this out.

804
01:08:58.479 --> 01:09:00.412
Jesus Christ

805
01:09:00.550 --> 01:09:02.241
We actually expected
a drug peddler to show up.

806
01:09:02.379 --> 01:09:04.278
But seeing the guest we have...

807
01:09:04.416 --> 01:09:06.176
The hotel has been seized
and he's under our radar.

808
01:09:06.314 --> 01:09:07.798
Do you want us to move in?

809
01:09:07.936 --> 01:09:09.800
No. You wait for me.
I'll be right there.

810
01:09:09.938 --> 01:09:11.388
Dad. well. I was
gonna tell you that...

811
01:09:11.526 --> 01:09:13.114
I'm gonna
be right back. okay?

812
01:09:13.252 --> 01:09:15.634
I'll be right back. Stay safe!

813
01:09:38.174 --> 01:09:40.521
- Hey. Mark. How's it going?
- Hey. guys. What have we got?

814
01:09:42.695 --> 01:09:44.456
So. the word is.
he's up on the sixth floor.

815
01:09:44.594 --> 01:09:46.285
Room 623.

816
01:09:46.423 --> 01:09:47.942
We've got him
under surveillance.

817
01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:49.219
Doesn't know we're coming.

818
01:09:49.357 --> 01:09:50.979
- We good?
- We're good.

819
01:09:51.117 --> 01:09:52.947
We'll take the left stairs.
You guys take the right.

820
01:09:53.085 --> 01:09:55.121
We'll surveil the place.
Let's make it happen. let's go.

821
01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:56.571
Let's go!

822
01:10:40.236 --> 01:10:41.582
Come here!
Come here!

823
01:10:44.101 --> 01:10:45.413
Hey! Hey!

824
01:10:50.970 --> 01:10:52.248
What the fuck?

825
01:10:53.490 --> 01:10:55.320
What? What is this? Who are you?

826
01:10:59.116 --> 01:11:00.773
If you don't
tell me what's going on.

827
01:11:00.911 --> 01:11:03.120
I'm gonna put a bullet
in your head right now.

828
01:12:00.833 --> 01:12:02.214
Come on. it's closed.

829
01:12:02.352 --> 01:12:03.664
Open it.

830
01:12:03.802 --> 01:12:05.251
You open it.

831
01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:06.943
I waited like seven years.

832
01:12:07.081 --> 01:12:08.738
You're gonna make me wait more?

833
01:12:08.876 --> 01:12:10.602
This door doesn't open.

834
01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:13.018
- Ah. really?
- You have to go to this one.

835
01:12:13.156 --> 01:12:15.020
Okay.

836
01:12:15.158 --> 01:12:16.366
I'm going.

837
01:12:22.130 --> 01:12:23.856
Pick up. pick up. pick up.

838
01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:30.898
I hate this show.

839
01:12:33.038 --> 01:12:36.179
I love you 'cause you're sexy.
But I hate this show.

840
01:12:36.317 --> 01:12:37.905
Pick up. pick up. pick up.

841
01:12:38.043 --> 01:12:39.838
Come on. baby. pick up.

842
01:12:39.976 --> 01:12:41.874
Come on! Pick up!

843
01:13:09.730 --> 01:13:11.387
Oh. you caca.

844
01:13:15.943 --> 01:13:17.738
Oh. my effing phone.

845
01:13:17.876 --> 01:13:19.878
It's fucking dead.

846
01:13:20.016 --> 01:13:21.500
I'd better go
check on the family.

847
01:14:09.168 --> 01:14:11.343
This walk is too far.

848
01:14:12.862 --> 01:14:15.209
Just gonna have
to move in with them.

849
01:14:25.322 --> 01:14:27.048
Miriam!

850
01:14:27.186 --> 01:14:30.776
Oh. my God! Oh. my God!
He's behind you. Miriam!

851
01:14:33.158 --> 01:14:35.816
Miriam. oh. Miriam!

852
01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.313
Oh. my God...

853
01:14:51.245 --> 01:14:53.316
- Dad!
- Baby? Baby?

854
01:14:53.454 --> 01:14:55.249
Are you with me?
What's he doing?

855
01:14:55.387 --> 01:14:56.733
What's he doing?
Can you see him?

856
01:14:56.871 --> 01:14:59.529
Daddy... He's just...
He just...

857
01:14:59.667 --> 01:15:01.911
He just
killed Miriam.

858
01:15:02.049 --> 01:15:04.258
Don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid. you'll be fine.

859
01:15:04.396 --> 01:15:06.363
Okay? What's he doing right now?

860
01:15:06.502 --> 01:15:07.848
Oh. my God!

861
01:15:07.986 --> 01:15:09.539
He killed Stephen too!

862
01:15:09.677 --> 01:15:12.059
He just killed him
right in front of me!

863
01:15:12.197 --> 01:15:13.405
Oh. no.
It's not gonna hold. baby.

864
01:15:13.543 --> 01:15:15.407
He's coming
in no matter what.

865
01:15:15.545 --> 01:15:17.443
He's coming in. Make your way
up to my bedroom. okay?

866
01:15:17.582 --> 01:15:19.722
Barricade the door.
Get some chairs.

867
01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:21.586
Whatever you got.
Whatever is in there.

868
01:15:21.724 --> 01:15:23.070
Just wait for me. baby.

869
01:15:23.208 --> 01:15:25.175
I won't be long.

870
01:15:25.313 --> 01:15:26.487
Just remember something.

871
01:15:26.625 --> 01:15:29.525
Kill or be killed.

872
01:16:10.289 --> 01:16:12.050
You're fucked!

873
01:16:17.055 --> 01:16:18.712
Shit!

874
01:16:25.511 --> 01:16:27.410
Come here...

875
01:16:34.693 --> 01:16:37.109
I'm gonna choke you out dead!

876
01:16:39.974 --> 01:16:43.806
But not yet. you little cunt!

877
01:16:49.605 --> 01:16:52.746
- Hey. hey.
-Listen to me

878
01:16:52.884 --> 01:16:54.644
How you killed my family.

879
01:16:54.782 --> 01:16:57.267
Listen to me.
if you hurt my daughter...

880
01:16:57.405 --> 01:16:58.510
You know what?

881
01:16:58.648 --> 01:17:00.892
I enjoyed killing your wife.

882
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:03.308
If you hurt my daughter.
I am gonna blow up--

883
01:17:03.446 --> 01:17:05.137
Fuck yourself.

884
01:17:05.275 --> 01:17:07.174
You fucking hurt my daughter--

I'm okay John.

894
01:18:07.441 --> 01:18:10.202
What about Alisha?
Is she gonna be all right?

895
01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:12.308
She's gonna be fine.
She's a tough girl.

896
01:18:12.446 --> 01:18:14.620
Yeah. Well. she is your kid.

897
01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:18.728
Look. it's gonna take
a ton of paperwork

898
01:18:18.866 --> 01:18:20.419
- to get this mess cleaned up.
- Yeah.

899
01:18:20.557 --> 01:18:23.250
So. um... in the meantime...

900
01:18:25.045 --> 01:18:26.702
Go enjoy your summer.

901
01:18:36.573 --> 01:18:38.230
Remember. if you need anything

902
01:18:38.368 --> 01:18:40.094
just let me know. all right?

903
01:18:41.371 --> 01:18:42.718
Good to see you as always.

904
01:19:06.569 --> 01:19:08.329
So. this whole time

905
01:19:09.641 --> 01:19:10.918
you had a plan.

906
01:19:12.955 --> 01:19:14.680
What do you mean "had a plan"?

907
01:19:15.612 --> 01:19:17.028
The training?

908
01:19:17.166 --> 01:19:18.581
The martial art?

909
01:19:18.719 --> 01:19:20.065
Setting everything up?

910
01:19:21.618 --> 01:19:23.068
You know. to be honest.

911
01:19:25.346 --> 01:19:27.797
I would've started training you
no matter what.

912
01:19:28.764 --> 01:19:30.593
But yeah.

913
01:19:30.731 --> 01:19:32.043
There was a plan.

914
01:19:34.148 --> 01:19:35.736
Hey. love.

915
01:19:38.704 --> 01:19:40.499
Damn it. Mark.

916
01:19:40.637 --> 01:19:42.467
If you don't stop drinking
this shit it's gonna kill you.

917
01:19:42.605 --> 01:19:43.917
Yeah.

918
01:19:44.055 --> 01:19:46.091
You're right.

919
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:49.163
You know.
after all these years. Miriam.

920
01:19:49.301 --> 01:19:50.751
chasing this guy.

921
01:19:50.889 --> 01:19:52.373
and I make no progress.

922
01:19:52.511 --> 01:19:54.790
I mean zero. nothing.
I just...

923
01:19:54.928 --> 01:19:56.999
Mark.

924
01:19:57.137 --> 01:19:58.448
Think about this.

925
01:19:58.586 --> 01:19:59.795
You've gotta put
the bait out there.

926
01:19:59.933 --> 01:20:01.072
Okay?

927
01:20:01.210 --> 01:20:03.384
Once he takes the bait.

928
01:20:03.522 --> 01:20:06.215
that's when you fucking pounce.
you get to kill him.

929
01:20:07.837 --> 01:20:10.460
And you protect family.
That's what it's all about.

930
01:20:12.462 --> 01:20:14.188
- Thanks Miriam.
-Yeah.

931
01:20:24.371 --> 01:20:25.993
It wasn't all me.

932
01:20:26.131 --> 01:20:28.996
You see. Miriam had a lot to do
with it as well.

933
01:20:31.067 --> 01:20:32.966
But I've gotta
tell you something else.

934
01:20:33.104 --> 01:20:37.039
What I started.
you finished pretty well.

935
01:20:37.177 --> 01:20:38.695
I'm not sure what that was.

936
01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:40.387
You were doing
some snake and crane.

937
01:20:40.525 --> 01:20:42.389
What was that? Huh?

938
01:20:48.222 --> 01:20:50.535
It's good to have you back.

939
01:20:51.467 --> 01:20:53.503
I missed you. Dad.

940
01:20:54.677 --> 01:20:56.230
I missed you too.
