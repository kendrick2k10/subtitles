36
00:02:38.897 --> 00:02:41.291
On the plane. this--
this woman comes up

37
00:02:41.422 --> 00:02:43.902
and she's watching me for like
10 minutes and the--

38
00:02:44.033 --> 00:02:46.818
the security guard comes
and moves her along.

39
00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:48.690
I'm just like. "Dude. I'm there
for people to watch me."

40
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.909
- You know what I mean?
- Hmm.

41
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.085
Anyway. it turns out that
that woman was the

42
00:02:53.216 --> 00:02:55.827
music director of the children's theatre.

43
00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.526
What'd she say?

44
00:02:58.656 --> 00:03:00.571
She said. come
and drop by in the new year.

45
00:03:00.702 --> 00:03:01.964
It's the holidays.

46
00:03:02.094 --> 00:03:05.054
but it's also theft and break-in season.

47
00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:08.536
Remember to lock your doors
and leave your porch light on.

48
00:03:21.592 --> 00:03:24.856
Don't let cold-hearted criminals
ruin your joy.

49
00:03:24.987 --> 00:03:26.902
They're looking for an easy
buck. Don't give it to them.

50
00:03:27.032 --> 00:03:28.730
Oh hey. excuse me.

51
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.253
If a criminal is desperate
enough to break into

52
00:03:30.384 --> 00:03:33.343
your home while you are there. be warned.

53
00:03:33.474 --> 00:03:36.128
they are most likely dangerous
and reckless.

54
00:03:40.045 --> 00:03:41.090
There you go.

55
00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:42.483
That's it. that's it?

56
00:03:42.613 --> 00:03:43.919
You got $3-- $3.50.

57
00:03:45.442 --> 00:03:46.443
- For those two things?
- Yeah.

58
00:03:46.574 --> 00:03:47.966
Okay.

59
00:03:50.882 --> 00:03:53.450
Mmhmm. 280 calories a pint.

60
00:03:53.581 --> 00:03:55.191
You know what Grandma used to say.

61
00:03:55.322 --> 00:03:56.932
if something seems too good to be true--

62
00:03:57.062 --> 00:03:58.760
- Probably is true.
- Exactly what she said.

63
00:04:07.508 --> 00:04:09.118
This was an innie yesterday.

64
00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:10.380
Oh. baby.

65
00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:11.555
You're beautiful.

66
00:04:11.686 --> 00:04:13.296
I'm a beautiful parade float.

67
00:04:22.305 --> 00:04:23.959
Hey. do you have any of those machines

68
00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:26.048

69
00:04:26.178 --> 00:04:27.658
- Yeah.

70
00:04:33.795 --> 00:04:35.971
So what's the--
how does this work?

71
00:04:36.101 --> 00:04:37.886
You-- you get a piece of the action here?

72
00:04:38.016 --> 00:04:39.888
You get some kind of incentive
for selling these tickets?

73
00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:42.934
About 5 percent.

74
00:04:43.065 --> 00:04:45.459
5 percent.

75
00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:47.287
You let Uncle Sam
into your sweet little cash

76
00:04:47.417 --> 00:04:49.419
business for 5 percent?

77
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.899
No fucking thank you.

78
00:04:52.596 --> 00:04:53.684
What are you going to do?

79
00:04:53.815 --> 00:04:54.903
What are you going to do?

80
00:04:55.033 --> 00:04:57.209
I bet this racket's long hours. huh?

81
00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.863
This shitty lighting?

82
00:04:58.994 --> 00:05:00.474

83
00:05:00.604 --> 00:05:01.692
- Mmhmm.

84
00:05:01.823 --> 00:05:03.303

when you met your betrothed
child bride. did she--

86

she know what kind of business
you were running?

87
00:05:13.008 --> 00:05:13.965
She's white.

88
00:05:15.097 --> 00:05:16.185
Like you.

89
00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:17.752
I'm just breaking your balls.

00:05:17.882 --> 00:05:19.362
I love small businesses.

92
00:05:21.103 --> 00:05:21.799
It's what makes this country
the greatest in the world.

93
00:05:26.282 --> 00:05:27.283

I can show you.

181
00:09:54.637 --> 00:09:56.378
Move real fucking slow. all right?

182
00:09:56.508 --> 00:09:57.771
Okay.

183
00:09:57.901 --> 00:09:59.381
Come on. Come on!

184
00:09:59.511 --> 00:10:00.600
Okay. okay.

185
00:10:03.907 --> 00:10:05.082
This is what we're going to do.

186
00:10:05.213 --> 00:10:06.780
Turn off the fucking lights.

187
00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:08.303
We're closed for the night.

188
00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:16.703
Grab a bag.

189
00:10:16.833 --> 00:10:18.226
Grab a fucking bag.

190
00:10:18.356 --> 00:10:20.228
I need all the phones. everything.

191
00:10:20.358 --> 00:10:22.883

192
00:10:23.013 --> 00:10:24.145
Hurry the fuck up. bro.

193
00:10:25.363 --> 00:10:26.887
Oh. my fucking God.

00:10:31.543 --> 00:10:32.980
Hey. hey.

195
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:34.372
Just do what he says.

196
00:10:34.503 --> 00:10:35.678
Hey. you all right?

197
00:10:37.158 --> 00:10:38.986
Now grab this motherfucker--

198
00:10:40.204 --> 00:10:41.118
Grab him!

199
00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.078
Fuck are you waiting for?
Come on. man.

200
00:10:44.208 --> 00:10:46.515
- Hurry the fuck up. man!

201
00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:47.559
What the fuck is wrong with you. man?

202
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.692
He's too heavy.
He's too heavy. man.

203
00:10:49.823 --> 00:10:51.433
- I'll help him.
- No. please.

204
00:10:51.563 --> 00:10:52.303
- No.
- Please. I can't. I can't.

205
00:10:52.434 --> 00:10:53.914
I have to. I know. It's fine.

206
00:10:54.044 --> 00:10:56.177
Let's just breathe. okay?
Just breathe. That's right.

207
00:10:56.307 --> 00:11:00.224
Yeah. You know?

208
00:11:00.355 --> 00:11:01.748
Okay.

209
00:11:01.878 --> 00:11:03.358
That's it. You're okay.
You're fine.

210
00:11:09.407 --> 00:11:10.278
Hurry up. man.

211
00:11:11.453 --> 00:11:12.280
Fuck.

00:11:14.761 --> 00:11:16.458
Okay. I'll be-- I'll be back.

213
00:11:25.032 --> 00:11:28.035

waiting around. man?

214
00:11:28.165 --> 00:11:29.079
Grab him!

00:11:30.385 --> 00:11:32.517

Why are you just sittin' here?

227

Man. how the fuck this shit work. bruh?

228
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.145
All this shit need to get deleted.

Come on. why are you just
staring at me. man?

230
00:12:39.367 --> 00:12:41.064
Can-- can you calm down. please?

231
00:12:43.066 --> 00:12:44.764
Please. man. look.

232
00:12:44.894 --> 00:12:46.722
Look. you're scaring her.

233
00:12:46.853 --> 00:12:48.768
It's all right.

234
00:12:48.898 --> 00:12:49.986
Come on. bro. what's your plan?

235
00:12:50.117 --> 00:12:51.466
Don't worry about my fucking plan.

236
00:12:51.596 --> 00:12:54.164
Worry about deleting this shit.

237
00:12:54.295 --> 00:12:57.733
Look. if you just lowered
the gun. maybe we could talk.

238
00:12:57.864 --> 00:12:59.256
Figure out a way to get you out of this.

239
00:12:59.387 --> 00:13:01.128
Yeah. you want me to lower
my gun after you try to

240
00:13:01.258 --> 00:13:02.956
pull this shit on me?

241
00:13:03.086 --> 00:13:05.219
Yeah. I ain't forget about that.

242
00:13:05.349 --> 00:13:07.003
Mr. Nice Guy now. huh?

243
00:13:08.918 --> 00:13:11.094
I just want to reconcile this. okay?

244
00:13:11.225 --> 00:13:13.401
I ain't laying my life down for you.

245
00:13:13.531 --> 00:13:15.011
And you ain't gonna kill all of us.

246
00:13:24.107 --> 00:13:25.500
Fuck.

247
00:13:41.342 --> 00:13:43.083
Oh. What's your name. man?

248
00:13:46.129 --> 00:13:47.652
Amir.

249
00:13:47.783 --> 00:13:49.045
And who are these two?

250
00:13:55.095 --> 00:13:57.488
Come on. man. you talk
to that old man out there

251
00:13:57.619 --> 00:13:59.360
and he was a fucking dickhead.

252
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.580
That's my daughter. Leila.

253
00:14:02.711 --> 00:14:04.582
And my wife. Carrie.

254
00:14:04.713 --> 00:14:06.758
And this place. it's all you?

255
00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:07.803
Man. what are you doing?

256
00:14:09.587 --> 00:14:11.415
Talking.

257
00:14:11.546 --> 00:14:12.547
You got a problem with that?

258
00:14:21.469 --> 00:14:22.600
What's your name. shorty?

259
00:14:24.037 --> 00:14:25.342
Ana Marlene.

260
00:14:25.473 --> 00:14:27.779
- Huh?
- Ana Marlene.

261
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:29.956
Her name's Ana Marlene.

262
00:14:30.086 --> 00:14:31.000
That's a nice name.

263
00:14:32.784 --> 00:14:34.134
And how about you?

264
00:14:34.264 --> 00:14:35.222
Abraham.

265
00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:37.920
I'm Sterling

266
00:14:40.575 --> 00:14:41.750
Nice to meet you.

267
00:14:43.839 --> 00:14:46.233
What's up with the suit. man?

268
00:14:46.363 --> 00:14:47.364
I'm a pianist.

269
00:14:49.018 --> 00:14:51.064
People still pay for that?

270
00:14:51.194 --> 00:14:52.630
Where were you playing at tonight?

271
00:14:53.936 --> 00:14:54.850
Nordstrom.

272
00:14:56.852 --> 00:14:58.593
How long you been doing that. man?

273
00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:02.945
Six years.

274
00:15:08.168 --> 00:15:09.125
All right. Amir.

275
00:15:11.649 --> 00:15:13.956
Why don't you tell me about
this fucking security system?

276
00:15:16.741 --> 00:15:17.873
What's your plan?

277
00:15:18.004 --> 00:15:20.006
Motherfucker. my plan

278
00:15:20.136 --> 00:15:22.486
is that you do what the fuck
I tell you to do.

279
00:15:22.617 --> 00:15:23.748
As soon as he gives you what you want.

280
00:15:23.879 --> 00:15:24.793
you're gonna kill us.

281
00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:26.316
Man. I didn't kill nobody.

282
00:15:26.447 --> 00:15:28.623
That fucking hero in the back did that.

283
00:15:28.753 --> 00:15:30.059
Well. then why'd you put the gun on him?

284
00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:33.149
Seeing that rich motherfucker
win. All of that money.

285
00:15:36.022 --> 00:15:37.762
Come on. now.

286
00:15:37.893 --> 00:15:39.199
We all had the same thought.

287
00:15:41.027 --> 00:15:42.767
I'm just the one that did it.

288
00:15:42.898 --> 00:15:44.769
You're absolutely insane.

289
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:46.684
No. I'm a millionaire.

290
00:15:46.815 --> 00:15:49.165
Not with that ticket.
Listen. dipshit.

291
00:15:50.427 --> 00:15:51.341
It's not that simple.

292
00:15:52.821 --> 00:15:55.128
When there's a winning ticket. especially.

293
00:15:55.258 --> 00:15:59.959
one as big as that one.
they know the store's involved.

294
00:16:00.089 --> 00:16:02.222
When you have all those
dead bodies out there.

295
00:16:02.352 --> 00:16:03.832
They're gonna start asking questions.

296
00:16:05.181 --> 00:16:08.445
And that money. that money goes away.

297
00:16:23.678 --> 00:16:25.288
I don't want to kill nobody.

298
00:16:27.899 --> 00:16:29.423
So long as I don't have to.

299
00:16:35.385 --> 00:16:36.430
You okay?

300
00:16:40.912 --> 00:16:44.090
Just gotta make up a story or something.

301
00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:45.743
- You know?
- What story?

302
00:16:45.874 --> 00:16:47.267
You're talking about this?

303
00:16:47.397 --> 00:16:51.184
I don't know. just some classic
black guy comes in.

304
00:16:51.314 --> 00:16:52.315
Tries to rob the white dude.

305
00:16:52.446 --> 00:16:54.709
Oh. fucking white supremacist.

306
00:16:54.839 --> 00:16:56.189
Man. don't do me like that.

307
00:16:57.625 --> 00:16:58.756
I get it. all right.

308
00:17:00.323 --> 00:17:02.586
But fuck. if we're gonna lie.

309
00:17:04.327 --> 00:17:07.026
we gotta lie about something the
system wants to believe. right?

310
00:17:08.636 --> 00:17:10.551
So black guy comes in...

311
00:17:10.681 --> 00:17:13.162
Tries to rob the rich old white man.

312
00:17:13.293 --> 00:17:14.946
Hero cop comes in.

313
00:17:15.077 --> 00:17:16.296
Bang. bang.

314
00:17:16.426 --> 00:17:17.514
They're gonna be looking for someone

315
00:17:17.645 --> 00:17:19.168
who don't even exist.

316
00:17:19.299 --> 00:17:20.604
And then what happens
when they find the person

317
00:17:20.735 --> 00:17:21.605
that doesn't exist?

318
00:17:22.998 --> 00:17:24.260
That won't be my problem.

319
00:17:25.914 --> 00:17:28.395
We live if we say that?

320
00:17:28.525 --> 00:17:29.657
Better.

321
00:17:29.787 --> 00:17:30.832
You get paid.

322
00:17:32.312 --> 00:17:34.270
The secret got a price tag.

323
00:17:38.492 --> 00:17:40.581
- 10.
- Ten what?

324
00:17:40.711 --> 00:17:41.582
$10 million?

325
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:43.801
Shit.

326
00:17:46.369 --> 00:17:47.631
Four.

327
00:17:47.762 --> 00:17:49.024
There are two dead people already.

328
00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:51.548
One's police.

329
00:17:51.679 --> 00:17:53.594
They don't arrest cop killers.
they execute them.

330
00:17:53.724 --> 00:17:55.944
So if we do this then--

331
00:17:56.075 --> 00:17:58.947
We ain't doing nothing yet.
we just-- we just talkin'.

332
00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:01.210
What you're talking about is impossible.

333
00:18:01.341 --> 00:18:03.865
You gonna say that after what
just fucking happened out there?

334
00:18:03.995 --> 00:18:06.302
I mean. you could throw
all our lives away. Easy.

335
00:18:06.433 --> 00:18:09.262
Shit. I didn't know life
was so great down at the mall.

336
00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.003
This is wrong.

337
00:18:15.224 --> 00:18:17.096
It's better to be lucky. than good.

338
00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.404
My dad was a good man.

339
00:18:21.535 --> 00:18:23.189
Church on Sundays. all of that.

340
00:18:24.625 --> 00:18:28.150
And that motherfucker died
of boall cancer at 37.

341
00:18:28.281 --> 00:18:30.283
He didn't have the money
to pay for treatments.

342
00:18:31.501 --> 00:18:32.633
That's a good man.

343
00:18:34.504 --> 00:18:36.637
Bad luck of being born poor.

344
00:18:41.381 --> 00:18:42.860
You about to have a baby. right?

345
00:18:45.211 --> 00:18:46.386
It's a boy or a girl?

346
00:18:47.691 --> 00:18:48.736
A son.

347
00:18:50.607 --> 00:18:52.479
You really gonna be able
to tell yourself you did

348
00:18:52.609 --> 00:18:54.394
everything you could for that boy?

349
00:18:56.396 --> 00:18:58.267
Money doesn't buy everything.

350
00:18:58.398 --> 00:19:00.487
Man. that's just a lyric
they get poor people

351
00:19:00.617 --> 00:19:02.619
to say to feel better
about having nothing.

352
00:19:04.099 --> 00:19:05.231
- Look.
- We're in for 20.

353
00:19:07.711 --> 00:19:09.278
Hey. hey. hey. hey. yo.

354
00:19:09.409 --> 00:19:11.585
We speak in English in here.
y'all. come on now.

355
00:19:12.716 --> 00:19:15.328
- 20.
- 20.

356
00:19:15.458 --> 00:19:18.461
Man. who taught y'all to negotiate?

357
00:19:18.592 --> 00:19:20.159
This is like a draft.

358
00:19:20.289 --> 00:19:22.422
You get a deal in the first
round or you're fucked.

359
00:19:23.901 --> 00:19:25.338
- $6 million.
- No. no. you can't share

360
00:19:25.468 --> 00:19:27.601
- something that's been stolen.
- Man. fuck that.

361
00:19:27.731 --> 00:19:29.864
Nobody ever got rich
without doing no crimes.

362
00:19:29.994 --> 00:19:32.040
We will go to jail. All of us.

363
00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:34.216
Yeah. you know who goes to jail?

364
00:19:34.347 --> 00:19:36.305
Poor people with public defenders.

365
00:19:36.436 --> 00:19:38.307
This is America.

366
00:19:38.438 --> 00:19:40.875
America don't care how you get your money.

367
00:19:41.005 --> 00:19:42.659
Look. we gonna get away with this.

368
00:19:44.008 --> 00:19:47.142
'cause as of today we all rich.

369
00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:50.145
Sounds like a deal to me.

370
00:19:54.758 --> 00:19:56.586
I'm not doing this. I-- I--

371
00:20:01.417 --> 00:20:02.897
I can't afford to be noble.

372
00:20:06.466 --> 00:20:07.989
Look. you two can go.

373
00:20:09.382 --> 00:20:11.645
I'm not gonna hold you hostage.

374
00:20:11.775 --> 00:20:12.689
Are you messing with us?

375
00:20:13.908 --> 00:20:15.170
What about this guy?

376
00:20:15.301 --> 00:20:17.346
Why-- why are you going along with this?

377
00:20:20.654 --> 00:20:21.872
It means everything is written.

378
00:20:27.487 --> 00:20:29.184
$6 million.

379
00:20:30.925 --> 00:20:32.970
I feel bad for that baby.

380
00:20:36.974 --> 00:20:38.802
We can do this.

381
00:20:38.933 --> 00:20:40.239
Look at me. Look at me.

382
00:20:41.762 --> 00:20:42.893
We can.

383
00:20:44.286 --> 00:20:47.507
It's not just about you and me. okay?

384
00:20:49.335 --> 00:20:52.903
This could be our chance.
at a better life.

385
00:21:01.869 --> 00:21:03.523
Yo. what the-- what the fuck?

386
00:21:08.397 --> 00:21:09.964
Yo. who the fuck is that?

387
00:21:10.094 --> 00:21:11.400
What the fuck are they doing here?

388
00:21:11.531 --> 00:21:12.836
It's my brother-in-law.

389
00:21:12.967 --> 00:21:15.056
He works here. okay. but
he's not supposed to work today.

390
00:21:15.186 --> 00:21:15.970
- I'll talk to him.
- What the fuck is he doing?

391
00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:17.188
I'll talk to him!

392
00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.280
Is this a brother-in-law you care about?

393
00:21:23.891 --> 00:21:25.762
It's my family.

394
00:21:25.893 --> 00:21:27.286
Get him the fuck out of here.

395
00:21:47.349 --> 00:21:48.785
- Hey.
- Hey.

396
00:21:48.916 --> 00:21:49.743
What are you doing here?

397
00:21:51.048 --> 00:21:52.049
I work tonight.

398
00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:53.442
Oh.

399
00:21:56.837 --> 00:21:58.229
Yeah. sorry.

400
00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.188
What happened here?
What's wrong? What'd you do?

401
00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:02.277
Oh. no. nothing.
Nothing. I-- I tripped.

402
00:22:02.408 --> 00:22:04.323
I slipped. I slipped on a--

403
00:22:04.453 --> 00:22:05.236
Hey. are you drinking again?

404
00:22:07.064 --> 00:22:08.718
- Who parked like an asshole?
- The-- the club down--

405
00:22:08.849 --> 00:22:10.894
And it's like 2 kilometers away.

406
00:22:11.025 --> 00:22:12.287
Why are you coming?
What are you--

407
00:22:12.418 --> 00:22:13.419
All these people
that are lined up to watch

408
00:22:13.549 --> 00:22:15.551
one guy spin on his record. so stupid.

409
00:22:15.682 --> 00:22:17.466
Oh my God.
Look at this place.

410
00:22:17.597 --> 00:22:18.641
- Hassan.
- Huh?

411
00:22:18.772 --> 00:22:19.729
We are closed tonight.

412
00:22:21.252 --> 00:22:22.602
Just-- just go home.

413
00:22:22.732 --> 00:22:24.821
Yeah? Come on.

414
00:22:24.952 --> 00:22:26.562
You told me to come in tonight
and help you out. Amir.

415
00:22:26.693 --> 00:22:27.476
No. no. no.

416
00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:31.567
Looked like you guys were closed earlier.

417
00:22:31.698 --> 00:22:32.742
I was getting nervous.

418
00:22:32.873 --> 00:22:33.613
Nobody else carries Lucky Star. you know?

419
00:22:33.743 --> 00:22:34.962
Hey. I got you. bud.

420
00:22:35.092 --> 00:22:36.920
No. no. no. hang-- hang on.
I got it. I got it.

421
00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:44.798
- Here you go.
- Thanks. man.

422
00:22:44.928 --> 00:22:46.190
Yeah. here you go.

423
00:22:46.321 --> 00:22:47.888
How did you get that cut?

424
00:22:48.018 --> 00:22:51.195
I-- I tripped in the back. Yeah.

425
00:22:51.326 --> 00:22:52.719
You guys don't have any
$14 Band-aids around here?

426
00:22:52.849 --> 00:22:54.982
He's been. uh...

427
00:22:55.112 --> 00:22:56.636
Didn't know you guys did that.

428
00:22:56.766 --> 00:22:58.507
We don't. I just tripped
in the back. okay?

429
00:22:58.638 --> 00:23:00.379
Well. sometimes.

430
00:23:00.509 --> 00:23:03.947
Look. I got the divorce papers
from Carrie.

431
00:23:04.078 --> 00:23:05.427
Why didn't you tell me that?

432
00:23:05.558 --> 00:23:07.473
That's why I wanted this space
for myself tonight. okay?

433
00:23:17.091 --> 00:23:18.266
What was that?

434
00:23:21.574 --> 00:23:22.705
Sounded like...

435
00:23:24.881 --> 00:23:26.579
I don't think it was--

436
00:23:26.709 --> 00:23:28.537
Been a lot of break-ins
in the area lately.

437
00:23:28.668 --> 00:23:30.670
No. no. I-- I don't think
it's anything. guys.

438
00:23:38.068 --> 00:23:39.853
Oh. come on.

439
00:23:39.983 --> 00:23:42.377
It's when I fell.
Yeah. I-- I was trying to--

440
00:23:42.508 --> 00:23:43.683
Let me just get a mop. dude.

441
00:23:43.813 --> 00:23:45.902
I got it. I got it. I got it.
It's on me.

442
00:23:46.033 --> 00:23:48.296
I was trying to load
the ice cream. I-- I got it.

443
00:23:48.427 --> 00:23:49.689
- Let me ring you up.
- Yeah.

444
00:23:49.819 --> 00:23:51.604
Yeah? Come on. okay?
Take the night off.

445
00:23:51.734 --> 00:23:52.953
Yeah.

446
00:23:57.348 --> 00:23:58.480
There we go.

447
00:23:58.611 --> 00:24:00.351
Amir. you're a lifesaver.

448
00:24:00.482 --> 00:24:02.528
A lot of track to cover before 5:00 a.m.

449
00:24:02.658 --> 00:24:04.094
Hoemeless keep leaving
their trash on the rails.

450
00:24:04.225 --> 00:24:05.487
Yeah. yeah. anytime.

451
00:24:07.141 --> 00:24:09.099
Uh. who's got the G-Wagon?

452
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:10.449
It's from the club.

453
00:24:10.579 --> 00:24:13.103
Hey. happy holidays. all right.

454
00:24:13.234 --> 00:24:14.365
- Thank you.
- Take care.

455
00:24:14.496 --> 00:24:15.758
- See you. bro.
- Yeah.

456
00:24:15.889 --> 00:24:16.803
You too.

457
00:24:16.933 --> 00:24:18.457
- Hmm?
- You too.

458
00:24:18.587 --> 00:24:19.893
What. no. let me help you
clean up over here.

459
00:24:20.023 --> 00:24:21.155
- No. no. no. no. listen. hey.
- look at all this mess.

460
00:24:21.285 --> 00:24:24.158
- What do you--
- I-- I need my own time tonight.

461
00:24:25.638 --> 00:24:26.769
- Yeah. go.
- Are you sure?

462
00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:30.643
- Yes. yeah.
- Okay. come here.

463
00:24:30.773 --> 00:24:31.992
- Take care. okay?
- Yeah.

464
00:24:32.122 --> 00:24:33.297
It'll better in the morning.

465
00:24:33.428 --> 00:24:34.690
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

466
00:24:34.821 --> 00:24:36.649
All right.
Hey. take care of this. huh?

467
00:24:36.779 --> 00:24:37.606
- Thank you.
- Come on.

468
00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:01.630
Phew. It's all right.

469
00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:04.981
He's not coming back.

470
00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:08.985
Oh. What car are they talking about?

471
00:25:09.116 --> 00:25:11.031
Oh shit.

472
00:25:11.161 --> 00:25:12.511
The dead guy.

473
00:25:12.641 --> 00:25:13.555
Well. what are we going to do about that?

474
00:25:13.686 --> 00:25:16.340
Well. we gotta move it. right?

475
00:25:16.471 --> 00:25:17.603
Right?

476
00:25:17.733 --> 00:25:18.734
People have seen it...

477
00:25:20.649 --> 00:25:22.172
If it-- wherever it goes.
it has to look like

478
00:25:22.303 --> 00:25:23.652
it was stolen or something.

479
00:25:26.437 --> 00:25:27.656
Shit.

480
00:25:28.875 --> 00:25:30.180
So. y'all in now?

481
00:25:37.492 --> 00:25:38.754
But we have to change your story.

482
00:25:40.016 --> 00:25:41.322
To what?

483
00:25:43.411 --> 00:25:44.543
There is no story.

484
00:25:46.414 --> 00:25:47.676
Nothing happened here.

485
00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:52.028
Because those two would have
seen it if something did.

486
00:25:52.159 --> 00:25:54.465
Yeah. she's right.

487
00:25:54.596 --> 00:25:56.380
Okay. what are we going to do
about the car?

488
00:25:56.511 --> 00:25:58.687
It's like what she said.

489
00:25:58.818 --> 00:26:02.082
Someone took it for a joyride.
dumped it in a fucking ditch.

490
00:26:02.212 --> 00:26:03.910
Yeah. okay.

491
00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.521
What about the bodies?

492
00:26:06.652 --> 00:26:07.566
They can't stay here.

493
00:26:13.049 --> 00:26:14.050
What do you want us to do?

494
00:26:17.401 --> 00:26:19.839
I've seen this one movie where they like

495
00:26:21.536 --> 00:26:25.671
poured acid on them
and the bodies just dissolve.

496
00:26:30.414 --> 00:26:32.155
No. No.

497
00:26:32.286 --> 00:26:33.548
There is no fucking way

498
00:26:33.679 --> 00:26:35.506
I'm gonna desecrate those bodies.

499
00:26:37.987 --> 00:26:41.469
What the fuck do you want to do
with them? They're dead.

500
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.775
Not that.

501
00:26:42.905 --> 00:26:45.952
I don't-- I don't think that's real.

502
00:26:46.082 --> 00:26:47.823
Even if. where would we get the...

503
00:26:51.044 --> 00:26:52.828
You know. Home Depot or something.

504
00:26:54.525 --> 00:26:55.875
Does he have a phone?

505
00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:01.315
Let's see. Let me see.

506
00:27:03.447 --> 00:27:04.666
Keys.

507
00:27:08.148 --> 00:27:10.846
Mr. George Laird.

508
00:27:16.635 --> 00:27:18.245
Okay. bingo.

509
00:27:20.551 --> 00:27:21.814
It's locked.

510
00:27:21.944 --> 00:27:22.902
What about the fingerprint?

511
00:27:24.773 --> 00:27:25.992
Shit.

512
00:27:35.523 --> 00:27:37.133
There you go.

513
00:27:37.264 --> 00:27:38.657
- Okay.
- What now?

514
00:27:46.142 --> 00:27:47.143
He goes on a trip

515
00:27:49.319 --> 00:27:51.278
Takes a vacation.

516
00:27:51.408 --> 00:27:52.671
Goes away for the holidays.

517
00:27:53.889 --> 00:27:55.586
Mexico.

518
00:27:55.717 --> 00:27:56.805
The Virgin Islands.

519
00:28:05.727 --> 00:28:07.686
I-- I can set up an out-of-office reply.

520
00:28:14.475 --> 00:28:16.869
This looks like his secretary.

521
00:28:16.999 --> 00:28:18.697
I'll-- I'll send her something.

522
00:28:18.827 --> 00:28:21.438
Copy and paste an old message.
so it doesn't sound wrong.

523
00:28:40.283 --> 00:28:42.024
With the holidays and these emails.

524
00:28:43.634 --> 00:28:45.332
it could be over a month

525
00:28:45.462 --> 00:28:47.638
before anyone even thinks
to ask where he is.

526
00:28:49.771 --> 00:28:51.077
I mean. he has family though. right?

527
00:28:53.253 --> 00:28:55.211
If he does. I've--
I've searched his phone.

528
00:28:57.648 --> 00:29:01.087
If he or they cared about him
at all. they would be in here.

529
00:29:02.305 --> 00:29:04.046
But they aren't.

530
00:29:04.177 --> 00:29:05.178
Right.

531
00:29:06.483 --> 00:29:09.312
What about the fucking cop?

532
00:29:09.443 --> 00:29:10.444
I don't know yet.

533
00:29:10.574 --> 00:29:11.880
But their bodies can't be found together.

534
00:29:13.621 --> 00:29:14.491
Cop shot him.

535
00:29:15.884 --> 00:29:17.581
He goes in his car.

536
00:29:17.712 --> 00:29:19.627
Put the gun in the car.

537
00:29:19.758 --> 00:29:20.846
If they ever find the body.

538
00:29:20.976 --> 00:29:22.195
The murder weapon is there.

539
00:29:22.325 --> 00:29:24.197
And the serial number leads
back to the police.

540
00:29:28.244 --> 00:29:30.203
You're fucking magical.

541
00:29:33.336 --> 00:29:34.468
Yeah...

542
00:29:56.707 --> 00:29:59.841
I said. give me that ticket right now!

543
00:30:12.767 --> 00:30:13.812
Get on the fucking ground!

544
00:30:13.942 --> 00:30:14.987
Get on the fucking ground!

545
00:30:17.293 --> 00:30:18.555
Fuck you!

546
00:30:44.755 --> 00:30:47.846
I swear to God.
II'll fuckin' kill you!

547
00:30:47.976 --> 00:30:50.892
$156 million. motherfucker!

548
00:31:00.946 --> 00:31:02.817
That little filly did persuade you to only

549
00:31:02.948 --> 00:31:04.036
let her off with a warning. am I right?

550
00:31:05.341 --> 00:31:06.777
Yes. I am.

551
00:31:06.908 --> 00:31:07.691
You were always the one

552
00:31:07.822 --> 00:31:08.562
with a soft spot for split-tails.

553
00:31:08.692 --> 00:31:09.737
- Me?
- Yeah. you.

554
00:31:09.868 --> 00:31:12.131
Get out of here.

555
00:31:12.261 --> 00:31:13.697
That's why I fuck with you.
'cause you're a perv like--

556
00:31:13.828 --> 00:31:15.134
What about you? What about you?

557
00:31:15.264 --> 00:31:16.352
Oh. no. no. We don't need--
we're talking

558
00:31:16.483 --> 00:31:17.310
- about you two. right?
- No. no. no. my--

559
00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.659
And what are you like.

560
00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:19.529
Those were the glory days. you're one--

561
00:31:26.232 --> 00:31:27.320
Tell me how that works again.

562
00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:30.279
So we get $6 and you get $138 million?

563
00:31:33.282 --> 00:31:34.675
Fuck.

564
00:31:38.853 --> 00:31:39.767
You wanna grab his legs?

565
00:31:40.942 --> 00:31:42.117
Yeah!

566
00:31:42.248 --> 00:31:43.292
All right. Merry Christmas. fucker!

567
00:31:43.423 --> 00:31:46.034
1. 2. 3!

568
00:31:46.165 --> 00:31:50.560
All right. hang.
okay-- hang on. man! Oh. sorry.

569
00:31:52.475 --> 00:31:53.259
All right. go ahead!

570
00:31:54.913 --> 00:31:56.697
Fuck!

571
00:31:56.827 --> 00:31:57.959
Oh. fuck me!

572
00:32:06.011 --> 00:32:07.012
Blew out his knee. that was it.
Became a beat cop.

573
00:32:08.361 --> 00:32:09.753
Now he got the rest of it.

574
00:32:09.884 --> 00:32:10.885
I'm turning in.

575
00:32:11.016 --> 00:32:12.104
Okay. honey.

576
00:32:13.714 --> 00:32:15.542
- Dick.
- What? What?

577
00:32:15.672 --> 00:32:17.239
You can sleep in Sammy's old
room tonight if you want.

578
00:32:19.415 --> 00:32:20.939
Why?

579
00:32:21.069 --> 00:32:23.593
Is it-- is it that obvious?
Thank you.

580
00:32:23.724 --> 00:32:25.334
- No but. thank you.
- Why?

581
00:32:25.465 --> 00:32:27.858
I'm fi-- Rhonda. thank you.
I'm fine.

582
00:32:27.989 --> 00:32:30.122
And Cody will be here
in a little while. All right?

583
00:32:30.252 --> 00:32:31.732
- Okay.
- Thank you.

584
00:32:31.862 --> 00:32:32.733
- Night. boys.
- Night-night.

585
00:32:32.863 --> 00:32:34.082
Good night.

586
00:32:35.562 --> 00:32:36.693
What's up with your boy. man?

587
00:32:36.824 --> 00:32:37.868
I thought I was gonna meet him tonight.

588
00:32:37.999 --> 00:32:39.740
Nah. he's doing the graveyard this week.

589
00:32:41.176 --> 00:32:42.395
What's the beat?

590
00:32:42.525 --> 00:32:44.919
Foot patrol. industrial area.
down by the port.

591
00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:46.094
Why isn't he in a prowler?

592
00:32:46.225 --> 00:32:47.922
I mean. especially this time of year.

593
00:32:48.053 --> 00:32:51.404
'Cause the chief's still
on this public relations kick.

594
00:32:51.534 --> 00:32:54.189
You know. community outreach
after that Ryan Harris deal.

595
00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.626
Cody said that that cop's
gonna do jail time.

596
00:32:56.757 --> 00:32:58.019
- Jesus fucking Christ.
- Yeah.

597
00:32:58.150 --> 00:32:59.803
Some guy gets pushed into a wall too hard.

598
00:32:59.934 --> 00:33:02.589
now your boy's gotta fucking
walk around in the cold.

599
00:33:03.764 --> 00:33:04.939
It's all gone to shit. man.

600
00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:07.594
Whose life is on the fucking
line out there?

601
00:33:07.724 --> 00:33:09.900
Hey. let me take care of it.

602
00:33:10.031 --> 00:33:10.945
I'll get him a better route.

603
00:33:12.729 --> 00:33:15.297
I appreciate it. but he's gotta
make it on his own.

604
00:33:17.212 --> 00:33:18.735
Speak of the devil.

605
00:33:18.866 --> 00:33:19.823
Hello?

606
00:33:21.521 --> 00:33:23.262
Speak up. I can't hear you.

607
00:33:23.392 --> 00:33:24.741
You gotta speak up.

608
00:33:24.872 --> 00:33:26.091
I need you. I need you.

609
00:33:27.831 --> 00:33:29.050
Oh. slow down. Cody. Slow down.

610
00:33:29.181 --> 00:33:31.183
They shot this guy.

611
00:33:31.313 --> 00:33:32.793
What happened?

612
00:33:32.923 --> 00:33:34.925
They shot this old guy.

613
00:33:35.056 --> 00:33:36.275
And they stole his lottery ticket.

614
00:33:37.972 --> 00:33:39.452
It's so much money. dad.

615
00:33:47.416 --> 00:33:49.984
Take the ferry to Fisher Island.

616
00:33:50.115 --> 00:33:52.421
Pack him a bag. he's going
for a long trip. right?

617
00:33:53.944 --> 00:33:55.294
The fuck you talking about?

618
00:33:55.424 --> 00:33:56.991
You think I'm gonna drive a car
with a fucking dead body

619
00:33:57.122 --> 00:33:58.775
in the trunk?

620
00:33:58.906 --> 00:34:01.169
When you get back. we'll deal
with the fucking cop.

621
00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:06.000
Nah. nah she's staying here. bro.

622
00:34:06.131 --> 00:34:08.524
I'm not leaving her with you.

623
00:34:08.655 --> 00:34:10.657
You need to go handle that shit.

624
00:34:10.787 --> 00:34:12.224
She stays.

625
00:34:12.354 --> 00:34:13.747
- Abraham.
- I'm not leaving you alone.

626
00:34:13.877 --> 00:34:15.879
No. I'm not leaving you alone
here. I'm not doing that.

627
00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:17.446
This isn't what we agreed to.

628
00:34:17.577 --> 00:34:19.448
I thought you said everything
was written. right?

629
00:34:19.579 --> 00:34:20.362
Stay out of this!

630
00:34:20.493 --> 00:34:21.842
Fuck that. you're not in charge!

631
00:34:21.972 --> 00:34:23.452
Hey. this is where you get
all of us killed.

632
00:34:23.583 --> 00:34:25.324
No. no. no. no. He needs us.

633
00:34:25.454 --> 00:34:26.977
He knows that. okay?

634
00:34:27.108 --> 00:34:28.718
He can't do any of this shit without us.

635
00:34:28.849 --> 00:34:31.460
Man. it sounds like you want
to give me my $6 million back.

636
00:34:35.943 --> 00:34:36.857
You know what?
I've been thinking.

637
00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:40.426
What is that. a Saturday night special?

638
00:34:40.556 --> 00:34:42.645
Post five shots?

639
00:34:42.776 --> 00:34:44.647
What'd you shoot that cop. four times?

640
00:34:44.778 --> 00:34:45.692
Five times?

641
00:34:46.954 --> 00:34:48.651
I don't know. man.

642
00:34:48.782 --> 00:34:50.392
I don't think you got any bullets left.

643
00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.529
Man. you act like you don't keep
this shit loaded.

644
00:34:58.574 --> 00:34:59.923
But yeah. you're right.

645
00:35:00.054 --> 00:35:02.012
Four. maybe five.

646
00:35:02.143 --> 00:35:03.144
Could be one left.

647
00:35:08.584 --> 00:35:10.108
Y'all want to test your luck?

648
00:35:13.676 --> 00:35:14.982
What are you doing?

649
00:35:17.289 --> 00:35:18.942
Look.

650
00:35:19.073 --> 00:35:22.598
Look. man. I'm just trying
to say we need to work together.

651
00:35:22.729 --> 00:35:23.991
I'm not leaving her.

652
00:35:25.471 --> 00:35:26.646
No.

653
00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:59.418
It's empty. It's been
empty this whole time.

654
00:36:12.909 --> 00:36:14.084
And I'm not doing that.

655
00:36:14.215 --> 00:36:15.521
No. I can't protect you
if I'm not here. I--

656
00:36:15.651 --> 00:36:17.784
This-- this is what you wanted.

657
00:36:19.568 --> 00:36:21.048
We can do this.

658
00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:23.355
I can do this.

659
00:36:23.485 --> 00:36:24.399
Look. I can't trust this white boy.

660
00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:25.574
No. trust me.

661
00:36:27.315 --> 00:36:28.490
This will work.

662
00:36:28.621 --> 00:36:29.926
We deserve this.

663
00:36:40.023 --> 00:36:41.634
Okay.

664
00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:07.355
Yeah.
Mandy and I got fucking outbid

665
00:37:07.486 --> 00:37:09.401
on that house in Pinecrest.

666
00:37:09.531 --> 00:37:12.665
Shit. I'll tell you what.
though. this place.

667
00:37:12.795 --> 00:37:16.712
Well. Ronnie's father left us
a little money when he passed.

668
00:37:16.843 --> 00:37:18.671
Barely covered the down payment.

669
00:37:18.801 --> 00:37:23.197
And now we gotta give the house
back to the bank

670
00:37:23.328 --> 00:37:24.503
for the girls' college.

671
00:37:25.591 --> 00:37:26.896
So. yeah.

672
00:37:32.728 --> 00:37:34.077
Hey.

673
00:37:34.208 --> 00:37:35.165
You all right. man?

674
00:37:36.645 --> 00:37:37.646
What's going on?

675
00:37:40.519 --> 00:37:41.694
Cody was shot.

676
00:37:41.824 --> 00:37:43.217
What-- what are you--

677
00:37:43.348 --> 00:37:44.349
- He-- he-- he just got shot.
- what are you talking about?

678
00:37:44.479 --> 00:37:45.872
Yeah. don't fucking kid around like that.

679
00:37:46.002 --> 00:37:47.439
Is he at the hospital?

680
00:37:47.569 --> 00:37:48.222
Well. what are we doing here?

681
00:37:48.353 --> 00:37:49.484
- Let's leave.
- Wait!

682
00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:52.182
There's something I need to talk
to you guys about.

683
00:37:57.579 --> 00:37:59.581
Hey. man. which one of these
phones is yours?

684
00:38:14.292 --> 00:38:15.815
All right.

685
00:38:15.945 --> 00:38:17.599
It's like a fucking baby
monitor. all right?

686
00:38:18.861 --> 00:38:20.646
I hear everything.

687
00:38:20.776 --> 00:38:21.864
Cops come.

688
00:38:23.388 --> 00:38:24.432
Turn me on mute.

689
00:38:27.609 --> 00:38:30.003
And I won't fucking hesitate.

690
00:38:30.133 --> 00:38:31.700
What if I lose service?

691
00:38:31.831 --> 00:38:32.875
Don't.

692
00:38:41.493 --> 00:38:42.798
Babe. baby. look at me.

693
00:38:44.017 --> 00:38:44.974
Look at me.

694
00:38:47.325 --> 00:38:49.588
If you can hear me.
I can hear you.

695
00:38:50.893 --> 00:38:53.069
You remember that song the night we met?

696
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.463
If anything happens. just sing it.

697
00:38:55.594 --> 00:38:56.464

Hey. hey. you guys hear me?

719
00:41:14.123 --> 00:41:15.429
I'm stuck at a train crossing.

720
00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:16.865
I'm going to be just a minute.

721
00:41:46.765 --> 00:41:48.375
Help. someone!

722
00:41:48.506 --> 00:41:49.507
Somebody help!

723
00:41:51.334 --> 00:41:52.292

00:41:53.772 --> 00:41:55.425
Hey. hey. hey. stop. stop!

725
00:41:55.556 --> 00:41:56.688
Dude. stop!

726
00:42:33.159 --> 00:42:34.160
Hey. is this your car?

727
00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:35.727
All right. man. just. yeah.

728
00:42:35.857 --> 00:42:37.424
just give me a minute to explain. okay?

729
00:42:37.555 --> 00:42:38.381
Let me check your license
and registration.

730
00:42:38.512 --> 00:42:39.731
It's not what you think.

731
00:42:39.861 --> 00:42:41.384
it's not what you think. all right?

732
00:42:41.515 --> 00:42:42.995
- Let me explain.
- What are those gloves for?

733
00:42:45.867 --> 00:42:47.695
- Listen. get down on the round.
- Just listen to me. though.

734
00:42:47.826 --> 00:42:48.827
You don't understand what's happened.

735
00:42:48.957 --> 00:42:50.524
- Hey. don't move.
- You don't understand!

736
00:43:16.811 --> 00:43:18.030
If I don't get back there.

737
00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.161
if I don't get back down.
she's going to be dead.

738
00:43:19.292 --> 00:43:20.772
Don't do this. Please.

739
00:43:25.777 --> 00:43:27.953
Is this blood? Is this blood?

740
00:44:12.301 --> 00:44:14.303
Just keep thinking
about that old question.

741
00:44:17.350 --> 00:44:20.092
What would you do
if you had a million dollars?

742
00:44:21.789 --> 00:44:23.138
I never knew the answer.

743
00:44:25.445 --> 00:44:26.707
Couldn't even imagine it.

744
00:44:29.144 --> 00:44:30.189
And now?

745
00:44:32.539 --> 00:44:34.106
Live life like Pablo.

746
00:44:35.803 --> 00:44:42.767
Money. cars. sex. mansions. hot tubs.

747
00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:45.595
I don't know.

748
00:44:47.685 --> 00:44:50.818
I just want to be free
from dealing with this bullshit.

749
00:45:14.059 --> 00:45:15.060
You smoke?

750
00:45:17.584 --> 00:45:22.067
Just in case you change your mind. Again.

751
00:45:28.247 --> 00:45:29.335
So repeat?

752
00:45:32.555 --> 00:45:34.514
What about you. Rock?

753
00:45:34.644 --> 00:45:36.168
What you going to do with all that money?

754
00:45:39.519 --> 00:45:43.479
The only thing that matters
is my daughter. her future.

755
00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:46.352
Where she could be one day.

756
00:45:53.141 --> 00:45:56.014
With that money.
I could reunite my family.

757
00:45:57.363 --> 00:45:58.712
Maybe buy some land in Montana.

758
00:46:00.235 --> 00:46:01.236
Montana?

759
00:46:02.847 --> 00:46:04.283
That's some cowboy shit.

760
00:46:05.719 --> 00:46:07.460
Open land. clean air.

761
00:46:10.202 --> 00:46:11.899
Better life.

762
00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:13.074
Better than this one.

763
00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:17.992
If that's what it means
to be a cowboy. then fuck it.

764
00:46:18.123 --> 00:46:19.211
I'll cowboy up.

765
00:46:27.088 --> 00:46:29.961
Hey. I want you there to see
the look on Mandy's face

766
00:46:30.091 --> 00:46:31.832
when I come home and tell her
about this ticket.

767
00:46:34.443 --> 00:46:36.184
We're going to take that trip to Spain.

768
00:46:36.315 --> 00:46:37.359
We're not just doing this thing.

769
00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:38.752
so you can have a fucking vacation.

770
00:46:47.326 --> 00:46:50.024
You understand the risk
I'm taking being here. right?

771
00:46:50.155 --> 00:46:50.982
My whole family could lose everything.

772
00:46:51.112 --> 00:46:52.200
We all have family.

773
00:46:53.549 --> 00:46:54.768
We're doing this for them.

774
00:47:04.125 --> 00:47:05.692
What about you. Shorty?

775
00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:11.524
What?

776
00:47:11.654 --> 00:47:13.395
What you gonna do with all that paper?

777
00:47:15.136 --> 00:47:18.836
Whatever happened in there.
they were all working together.

778
00:47:18.966 --> 00:47:20.925
They stopped being hostages the minute

779
00:47:21.055 --> 00:47:23.101
they started working with that shooter.

780
00:47:23.231 --> 00:47:24.624
No one is innocent.

781
00:47:29.585 --> 00:47:31.761
He going to put a ring
on that finger or what?

782
00:47:33.067 --> 00:47:34.242
We love each other.

783
00:47:36.027 --> 00:47:38.681
I don't want to follow the same
pattern everyone else does.

784
00:47:40.205 --> 00:47:42.729
Being married did not make
my parents happy.

785
00:47:47.386 --> 00:47:51.651
Yeah. well. you're too smart
to be waiting on other

786
00:47:51.781 --> 00:47:52.957
people all day.

787
00:48:07.667 --> 00:48:10.800
I was at a dentist office

788
00:48:10.931 --> 00:48:15.066
training to be a hygienist slash
dental assistant.

789
00:48:17.503 --> 00:48:18.765
I started in reception.

790
00:48:21.289 --> 00:48:24.902
The dentist. Dr. John.

791
00:48:27.905 --> 00:48:32.039
If you wanted to learn. he'd teach you.

792
00:48:35.216 --> 00:48:36.957
Maybe even help pay for your school.

793
00:48:40.918 --> 00:48:41.919
The other girls in the office.

794
00:48:42.049 --> 00:48:43.137
they were all doing the same thing.

795
00:48:45.183 --> 00:48:46.445
I told myself.

796
00:48:47.968 --> 00:48:51.406
because he was married. and had a family.

797
00:48:53.756 --> 00:48:54.757
he was a mentor.

798
00:48:56.542 --> 00:49:01.764
The attention was because I was
smart and special and not...

799
00:49:08.728 --> 00:49:12.340
You just skipped the whole part
about how you got knocked up.

800
00:49:16.823 --> 00:49:18.564
I met Abraham in a bar.

801
00:49:24.396 --> 00:49:28.661
He was playing the piano.
The song was beautiful.

802
00:49:36.408 --> 00:49:37.365
I bought him a drink.

803
00:49:42.544 --> 00:49:44.807
What happened to that dickhead boss?

804
00:49:47.636 --> 00:49:49.812
When he found out
I was pregnant. he fired me.

805
00:49:53.599 --> 00:49:54.687
Just like that?

806
00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:57.995
Yeah.

807
00:49:58.125 --> 00:49:59.953
You couldn't even sue him or nothing?

808
00:50:01.215 --> 00:50:02.129
I couldn't.

809
00:50:03.913 --> 00:50:05.306
No. he had all the power.

810
00:50:07.352 --> 00:50:08.744
I just wanted it to go away.

811
00:50:11.138 --> 00:50:12.052
Well. shit.

812
00:50:14.446 --> 00:50:16.187
You got the power now.

813
00:50:17.971 --> 00:50:19.494
What you want to do about it?

814
00:50:24.978 --> 00:50:25.979
All right.

815
00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:27.024
That's everything.

817
00:50:34.161 --> 00:50:35.119
What was that?

818
00:50:35.249 --> 00:50:37.077
When are you back?

819
00:50:38.905 --> 00:50:40.167
About two hours.

All right. hurry up. man.

And he had a mask.

893
01:02:01.674 --> 01:02:05.243

895
01:02:07.593 --> 01:02:08.899
Okay. Is that all? Are you sure?

896
01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:10.639
- Do they have your gun. Cody?
- I don't know.

897
01:02:10.770 --> 01:02:11.379
Are there any other firearms?

898
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:13.033
I don't know.

899
01:02:13.164 --> 01:02:14.121
It was an accident.

900
01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:17.646
It was an accident.

901
01:02:17.777 --> 01:02:19.866
It's all right. Shh. All right.
all right. It's okay.

902
01:02:19.997 --> 01:02:20.954
Did you see the ticket?

903
01:02:23.130 --> 01:02:24.479
Where's my dad?

904
01:02:24.610 --> 01:02:26.873
Hey. Cody. did you see it?

905
01:02:27.004 --> 01:02:28.788
Get me my dad.

906
01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:46.545
Okay. okay. okay. okay.

907
01:03:37.030 --> 01:03:38.205
Oh.

908
01:04:44.228 --> 01:04:45.359
How's that...

909
01:05:05.727 --> 01:05:06.990
He's out. man.

910
01:05:10.036 --> 01:05:11.908
I don't know how much longer he's got.

911
01:05:13.953 --> 01:05:14.954
This is fucked.

912
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.610
We ain't going anywhere until whoever that

913
01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:20.307
bitch is waiting for gets back.

914
01:05:51.556 --> 01:05:53.384
Abraham.

915
01:05:53.514 --> 01:05:54.472
No. No. stop.

916
01:06:08.703 --> 01:06:09.704
All right. get up.

917
01:06:09.835 --> 01:06:10.879
All right. get up.

918
01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:16.189
Now walk. Walk.

919
01:06:40.431 --> 01:06:41.127
What's her name?

920
01:06:44.957 --> 01:06:48.526
I don't know. I don't know
what you're talking about. man.

921
01:06:48.656 --> 01:06:49.875
I was just going to buy a vape.

922
01:06:53.922 --> 01:06:56.751
Who is she? What's her name?

923
01:06:56.882 --> 01:06:59.145
Look.

924
01:07:02.844 --> 01:07:04.281
You hear me. boy?

925
01:07:06.805 --> 01:07:07.849
Get her to come out here.

926
01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:09.068
Where is he?

927
01:07:12.245 --> 01:07:13.420
What?

928
01:07:13.551 --> 01:07:14.900
Ana. get out of there! Run!

929
01:07:20.427 --> 01:07:23.648
Is this a picture of you
on this phone here?

930
01:07:23.778 --> 01:07:26.042
Because you look so happy together.

931
01:07:26.172 --> 01:07:27.043
What did you do to him?

932
01:07:28.435 --> 01:07:29.349
He's alive.

933
01:07:32.004 --> 01:07:33.266
I wanna hear him say that.

934
01:07:40.882 --> 01:07:42.145
No.

935
01:07:42.275 --> 01:07:43.320
Come out.

936
01:07:43.450 --> 01:07:44.973
Give us the ticket.

937
01:07:45.104 --> 01:07:46.845
We'll let you walk away.

938
01:07:46.975 --> 01:07:49.587
Nothing will happen to you
or your baby's daddy.

939
01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:54.766
That sounds like we're still
dead at the end of this.

940
01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:59.249
You have our word that that won't happen.

941
01:07:59.379 --> 01:08:00.728
You tried to kill me.

942
01:08:00.859 --> 01:08:03.775
Your word isn't good enough.

943
01:08:03.905 --> 01:08:05.559
Well. we had to get our man out of there.

944
01:08:06.952 --> 01:08:09.737
We want to resolve this quickly
and safely.

945
01:08:12.871 --> 01:08:15.439
The cop in here?

946
01:08:15.569 --> 01:08:17.658
The dead one.

947
01:08:17.789 --> 01:08:19.878
Dick Sims?

948
01:08:20.008 --> 01:08:22.315
He was a dirty cop.

949
01:08:22.446 --> 01:08:25.362
Busted. shaking down
low-level drug dealers.

950
01:08:25.492 --> 01:08:26.798
He never gave up who else he did it with.

951
01:08:26.928 --> 01:08:29.148
but they know he wasn't working alone.

952
01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:34.110
The cop?

953
01:08:35.763 --> 01:08:37.330
We thought he was dead.

954
01:08:39.245 --> 01:08:40.246
We didn't know.

955
01:08:43.945 --> 01:08:45.773
I just wanted some ice cream.

956
01:08:51.388 --> 01:08:53.346
Well. he must have called you
here. He is alive?

957
01:08:56.697 --> 01:08:58.917
Did he tell you he killed an old man?

958
01:08:59.047 --> 01:09:01.702
Because right now his gun
is with that body.

959
01:09:03.965 --> 01:09:05.489
Abraham was supposed to get rid of it.

960
01:09:05.619 --> 01:09:08.100
but if he's here. then he didn't.

961
01:09:12.539 --> 01:09:13.932
When they find it.

962
01:09:15.716 --> 01:09:20.199
that gun will come back
to that cop-- and you.

963
01:09:23.159 --> 01:09:26.162
But it doesn't have to happen like that.

964
01:09:26.292 --> 01:09:28.381
Not if we work together.

965
01:09:32.255 --> 01:09:34.082
I want my share.

966
01:09:34.213 --> 01:09:36.607
I want him. and I want out of here.

967
01:09:36.737 --> 01:09:37.825
Fuck you!

968
01:09:39.392 --> 01:09:42.047
Your man doesn't have much time left.

969
01:09:42.178 --> 01:09:44.092
Don't threaten me.

970
01:09:44.223 --> 01:09:46.007
You think they're going to give
up $150 million

971
01:09:46.138 --> 01:09:47.270
without asking questions?

972
01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:48.749
What's your story?

973
01:09:49.968 --> 01:09:51.926
Because I know a good one.

974
01:09:52.057 --> 01:09:54.146
It's about a young. poor.

975
01:09:54.277 --> 01:09:56.279
pregnant waitress and her piano player.

976
01:09:58.281 --> 01:09:59.978
She won the lottery and some very bad men

977
01:10:00.108 --> 01:10:01.675
tried to kill her for it.

978
01:10:01.806 --> 01:10:03.024
And you know what happened next?

979
01:10:04.156 --> 01:10:09.727
Some brave police officers

980
01:10:09.857 --> 01:10:13.165
saved her and she was so grateful...

981
01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:16.429
She split the money with them.

982
01:10:18.692 --> 01:10:23.219
It's very cute. but the winner
always tells the story.

983
01:10:23.349 --> 01:10:27.310
I kind of need you to realize
the situation you're in here.

984
01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:30.269
Stop acting like you have the control.

985
01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:32.053
I have the money.

986
01:10:32.184 --> 01:10:33.707
Fuck you. cunt!

987
01:10:33.838 --> 01:10:35.231
We can kill you all if we want to!

988
01:10:35.361 --> 01:10:36.449
No one will fucking--

989
01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:38.582
You need us.

990
01:10:38.712 --> 01:10:40.627
What's your story?

991
01:10:40.758 --> 01:10:42.760
How do you have the ticket?
Where did you get it?

992
01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:46.894
If you want that money.
we're the only chance you have.

993
01:10:49.941 --> 01:10:51.203
Okay. okay.

994
01:10:51.334 --> 01:10:53.597
We're your only chance.

995
01:10:53.727 --> 01:10:55.816
- Bells of St. Mary's.
- What's the offer?

996
01:10:55.947 --> 01:10:58.558

All right.

1001
01:12:11.065 --> 01:12:12.415
What the fuck?

1002
01:12:49.756 --> 01:12:50.931
Let's do this for your dad.

1003
01:14:24.024 --> 01:14:25.243
Fuck!

1004
01:16:15.266 --> 01:16:17.007
Oh. okay.

1005
01:17:37.696 --> 01:17:39.655
What was that song
you were singing earlier?

1006
01:18:52.118 --> 01:18:53.119
Don't Move!

1007
01:19:00.431 --> 01:19:01.519
You killed my dad.

1008
01:19:06.872 --> 01:19:10.049
All this is because of you.

1009
01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:11.224
No!

1010
01:19:11.355 --> 01:19:13.313
No!

1011
01:19:13.444 --> 01:19:14.532
No!

1012
01:19:16.142 --> 01:19:17.665
I tried to save you.

1013
01:19:18.928 --> 01:19:20.190
I fucking tried.

1014
01:19:22.888 --> 01:19:24.803
I tried to do the right thing.

1015
01:19:28.546 --> 01:19:30.374
Don't look at me.

1016
01:19:30.504 --> 01:19:32.985
Don't look at me.

1017
01:19:33.116 --> 01:19:34.770
Don't look at me!
Close your eyes now!

1018
01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:37.947
No. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no!

01:19:39.992 --> 01:19:43.169
Don't do it. don't do it.
don't do it. Please.

1021
01:20:00.883 --> 01:20:02.580
Please don't do it.

1022
01:20:02.710 --> 01:20:03.973
Officer Sims.

1023
01:20:15.549 --> 01:20:16.768
Stand down. son.

1024
01:20:19.858 --> 01:20:23.427
Hey. okay.

1025
01:20:23.557 --> 01:20:24.471
Stand down.

1026
01:20:28.127 --> 01:20:29.520
I'm going to take this from you. okay?

1027
01:20:30.913 --> 01:20:31.783
Everything's gonna be all right.

1028
01:20:38.877 --> 01:20:41.488
That's it. that's it.

1029
01:21:07.558 --> 01:21:11.954
You need us.

1030
01:21:18.656 --> 01:21:19.962
You got a lot of heart. girl.

1031
01:21:44.595 --> 01:21:46.031
I only need one of you.

1032
01:22:40.738 --> 01:22:45.961
All you remember is me. saving your lives.

1033
01:23:41.190 --> 01:23:46.804
Death. tragedy. heroism. and $156 million.

1034
01:23:46.934 --> 01:23:50.590
A Christmas miracle turned
to an absolute horror.

1035
01:23:50.721 --> 01:23:54.290
But luckily. this story
has a happy ending.

1036
01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:56.379
Because you saved that poor girl.

1037
01:23:56.509 --> 01:24:00.165
And in return. she gave you $78 million.

1038
01:24:00.296 --> 01:24:01.427
I know. I know.

1039
01:24:01.558 --> 01:24:03.516
It was so sweet.

1040
01:24:03.647 --> 01:24:05.823
I mean. she really didn't have to do that.

1041
01:24:05.953 --> 01:24:07.477
And I'm-- I'm no hero.

1042
01:24:07.607 --> 01:24:09.696
I did what any other good cop would do.

1043
01:24:09.827 --> 01:24:13.004
Well. she was really blessed
to have you there.

1044
01:24:13.135 --> 01:24:15.050
So what's next for you and your family?

1045
01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:16.442
What are you all going to do?

1046
01:24:16.573 --> 01:24:21.491
Well. I suppose. anything I want.

1047
01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:44.122
What's up with the bear?

1048
01:24:46.603 --> 01:24:47.517
Another gift.
