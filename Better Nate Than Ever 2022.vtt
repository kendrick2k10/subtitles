00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:05.541
They say the neon lights
Are bright on Broadway

4
00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:13.750
They say there's always magic in the air

5
00:01:15.583 --> 00:01:19.333
But when you're walkin' down that street

6
00:01:19.416 --> 00:01:23.583
And you ain't had enough to eat

7
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:30.541
The glitter rubs right off
And you're nowhere

8
00:01:40.583 --> 00:01:43.500
Bro. It's like00 a.m.

9
00:01:44.875 --> 00:01:49.916
They say that I won't last too long
On Broadway

10
00:01:52.791 --> 00:01:59.333
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home
They all say

11
00:02:00.416 --> 00:02:03.875
But they're dead wrong. I know they are

12
00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:08.666
'Cause I can play this here guitar

13
00:02:09.875 --> 00:02:14.458
I won't quit till I'm a star on Broadway

14
00:02:19.458 --> 00:02:22.791
Hi. Hello. I couldn't sleep.
Could you sleep? 'Cause I couldn't sleep.

15
00:02:22.875 --> 00:02:24.375
And good morning to you. Nate.

16
00:02:24.458 --> 00:02:25.583
Slept like a baby.

17
00:02:25.666 --> 00:02:27.541
Today is very low stakes for me.

18
00:02:30.041 --> 00:02:32.041
I'll just be happy
if I get cast in the chorus.

19
00:02:32.125 --> 00:02:34.250
You should have auditioned for a big part.

20
00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:36.500
We should be. like.
nervous about this together.

21
00:02:36.583 --> 00:02:39.458
Yeah. no thanks.
I don't really do rejection.

22
00:02:39.916 --> 00:02:44.541
Anyway. I was just calling
to say "good luck" or "break a leg."

23
00:02:44.625 --> 00:02:46.208
You deserve the lead this year.

24
00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:47.583
You really think so?

25
00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:49.750
I mean. should Wicked
have beaten Avenue Q

26
00:02:49.833 --> 00:02:51.083
at the 2004 Tony Awards?

27
00:02:52.125 --> 00:02:53.291
Obviously.

28
00:02:54.458 --> 00:02:55.458
I rest my case.

29
00:03:03.291 --> 00:03:05.166
Hey. You're up early.

30
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.500
Today is the day. Ma.

31
00:03:06.833 --> 00:03:08.458
Is this sweater trying too hard?

32
00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:10.041
I want my look to say.

33
00:03:10.125 --> 00:03:12.208
"I am honored to have been cast
as the lead role.

34
00:03:12.291 --> 00:03:13.708
"but I wasn't expecting it."

35
00:03:13.791 --> 00:03:16.958
They're posting the cast list
for the school play today.

36
00:03:17.041 --> 00:03:19.375
-Musical.
-Sorry?

37
00:03:19.583 --> 00:03:21.125
Musical. Not play.

38
00:03:21.208 --> 00:03:22.208
Yo-yo!

39
00:03:22.291 --> 00:03:26.625
Anthony. please.
Track bag in the clean laundry. Really?

40
00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:29.708
No cup?

41
00:03:30.333 --> 00:03:31.500
What am I. six?

42
00:03:31.583 --> 00:03:32.833
All right. you two.

43
00:03:33.375 --> 00:03:36.875
Nate. please get going.
the bus is gonna be here any minute.

44
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:43.333
-Are you wearing lipstick?
-No.

45
00:03:43.833 --> 00:03:45.416
Bro. you're wearing lipstick.

46
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.125
It's lip gloss. Clinical strength.

47
00:03:48.833 --> 00:03:51.833
The pediatrician said
my lip skin is unusually sensitive.

48
00:03:51.916 --> 00:03:55.083
-Did the pediatrician actually say that?
-Work with me here. Ma.

49
00:03:57.458 --> 00:04:00.583
All right. just wait for my truck
to pull out before you leave.

50
00:04:00.666 --> 00:04:03.458
And untuck your sweater.
You're trying too hard.

51
00:04:08.083 --> 00:04:09.333
Ignore Anthony.

52
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.541
Obviously.

53
00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:28.916
Good day. guv'nor.

54
00:04:30.833 --> 00:04:32.000
Tough crowd.

55
00:04:46.375 --> 00:04:48.541
No more girls in this row.

56
00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.375
Ha-ha. Super original.

57
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.833
Go on. Ladies first.

58
00:04:57.708 --> 00:04:59.791
Don't touch my rabbit foot.

59
00:05:01.583 --> 00:05:03.708
Oh. my gosh! I'm so sorry.

60
00:05:05.583 --> 00:05:07.416
Can I have my rabbit foot back?

61
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.666
Sit down. boys.

62
00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.625
Better watch your back
in the hall today. loser.

63
00:05:25.375 --> 00:05:26.750
Good news.

64
00:05:31.916 --> 00:05:33.333
Wow. this is an honor.

65
00:05:34.291 --> 00:05:36.291
Wow. I can't believe it.
I'm the lead.

66
00:05:36.375 --> 00:05:39.500
Please. please. please. please.

67
00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.625
Better luck next time. Nate.

68
00:05:50.541 --> 00:05:51.750
Thanks.

69
00:05:51.833 --> 00:05:54.500
Congratulations on getting the role
of Abraham Lincoln

70
00:05:54.583 --> 00:05:57.500
in The Unauthorized Rock Musical.

71
00:05:57.583 --> 00:05:58.833
You're gonna be amazing.

72
00:05:58.916 --> 00:06:00.000
Thanks.

73
00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.666
Nathan. Did you see the list?

74
00:06:07.541 --> 00:06:08.541
I just...

75
00:06:10.625 --> 00:06:11.875
It's a big role.

76
00:06:12.541 --> 00:06:14.166
The title role.

77
00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:18.250
It's a lot for someone who's never had
a leading role before.

78
00:06:19.125 --> 00:06:23.166
It's hard to get a leading role
when no one will give you a chance. So...

79
00:06:25.083 --> 00:06:28.250
If you'll excuse me.
I need to have a word with my associate.

80
00:06:30.791 --> 00:06:33.708
"Good news"? You texted that
you had "Good news."

81
00:06:33.791 --> 00:06:36.750
Libby. I wasn't even cast
as Lincoln's understudy.

82
00:06:36.833 --> 00:06:39.791
I didn't even get his son. Who's dead.

83
00:06:39.875 --> 00:06:42.666
And. yes. we will have fun
in the chorus together.

84
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.875
but I was cast as a tree. Libby. A tree.

85
00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.625
Do you realize
what this says about me. right?

86
00:06:48.708 --> 00:06:52.416
That my parents are right.
I should just give up on my dreams now.

87
00:06:53.208 --> 00:06:55.208
Can I talk yet.
or are you still yelling?

88
00:06:55.291 --> 00:06:56.583
I'm still yelling!

89
00:06:57.791 --> 00:06:59.000
Okay. you can talk now.

90
00:06:59.416 --> 00:07:02.000
Name the best animated movie of all time.

91
00:07:02.083 --> 00:07:04.500
I don't know. Pre-Moana or post-Moana?

92
00:07:04.583 --> 00:07:07.375
Lilo & Stitch. Natey. Lilo & Stitch.

93
00:07:09.708 --> 00:07:11.666
Sorry. I thought we were alone.

94
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.541
-You guys are so weird.
-We know.

95
00:07:15.583 --> 00:07:19.416
Okay. Lilo & Stitch. Cult classic.
I'm intrigued. Go on.

96
00:07:20.125 --> 00:07:23.375
I've got some breaking news
about this weekend.

97
00:07:23.458 --> 00:07:27.916
Whatever it is. it better not involve
any more glitter lip gloss. I'm serious.

98
00:07:30.333 --> 00:07:32.333
Manhattan Island. baby.

99
00:07:32.416 --> 00:07:34.375
It's an open audition.

100
00:07:34.458 --> 00:07:35.500
Tomorrow.

101
00:07:35.583 --> 00:07:37.625
Ever since we were little.
we've been like.

102
00:07:37.708 --> 00:07:39.875
"We should take a road trip
to New York someday."

103
00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.666
Just you and me.

104
00:07:42.708 --> 00:07:44.708
So. I had this crazy idea.

105
00:07:44.791 --> 00:07:48.500
They're making Lilo & Stitch
into a Broadway musical?

106
00:07:50.083 --> 00:07:51.083
Wow.

107
00:07:53.333 --> 00:07:55.625
Nate Foster. yes?

108
00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:57.416
Absolutely yes!

109
00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:02.250
Welcome to the first audition
of the rest of your life!

110
00:08:07.916 --> 00:08:11.916
You really think you're going
to drive to New York in a cab?

111
00:08:16.666 --> 00:08:17.708
So?

112
00:08:17.791 --> 00:08:19.458
How would we even get to New York?

113
00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:22.583
Would Stitch pick us up in his spaceship?

114
00:08:22.666 --> 00:08:24.458
Okay. first of all. tone.

115
00:08:25.666 --> 00:08:27.500
Second. no.

116
00:08:27.583 --> 00:08:29.833
We'll sneak away on an overnight bus.

117
00:08:29.916 --> 00:08:32.541
Libby. my mom doesn't even
let me go to Rite Aid alone.

118
00:08:32.625 --> 00:08:34.500
Come on. Foster.

119
00:08:34.583 --> 00:08:35.708
Live a little.

120
00:08:36.791 --> 00:08:40.041
I'd hate to not be your date
to the Tony Awards.

121
00:08:42.833 --> 00:08:48.416
And the Tony Award
for Best Actor of All Time goes to...

122
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.583
Where would you even sleep in New York?

123
00:08:53.833 --> 00:08:55.750
Where would we even sleep?

124
00:08:55.833 --> 00:08:57.791
Hello. what about your aunt?

125
00:08:57.875 --> 00:09:00.333
Oh. good point. Nightmare scenario.

126
00:09:00.416 --> 00:09:02.708
Oh. wow. love her that much. huh?

127
00:09:02.791 --> 00:09:05.541
I thought she was some
big Broadway actress.

128
00:09:05.625 --> 00:09:09.166
She is. And she would report me
to my mom immediately.

129
00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:13.250
They have very antagonistic
Glinda versus Elphaba. act one energy.

130
00:09:13.333 --> 00:09:15.708
You think we're going
to arrive in New York City

131
00:09:15.791 --> 00:09:18.708
and run into your aunt?
In a city of 17 billion people?

132
00:09:18.791 --> 00:09:20.916
With my luck? Yes.

133
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.041
Nate. You didn't even get cast
as Lincoln's dead son.

134
00:09:24.125 --> 00:09:25.250
You don't have luck.

135
00:09:27.166 --> 00:09:29.291
Yo. Natey the lady!

136
00:09:30.625 --> 00:09:32.625
Watch your back.

137
00:09:36.916 --> 00:09:39.208
You know what? Forget New York.

138
00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:43.166
I'm just trying to survive seventh grade.

139
00:09:46.375 --> 00:09:48.666
Well. Nate. that's... Okay.

140
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:55.166
NATE'When we go to West Virginia...

141
00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.333
Hello. Hi.

142
00:10:01.208 --> 00:10:03.916
Oh. my gosh! Are we... Did we get evicted?

143
00:10:04.041 --> 00:10:05.541
-What? No.
-Not yet.

144
00:10:05.625 --> 00:10:08.416
Okay. he's home. Will you guys just spill?

145
00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.666
-What's goin' on?
-Boys...

146
00:10:11.083 --> 00:10:14.333
Daddy is taking me away for the weekend.

147
00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:18.833
Somewhere fancy in West Virginia
for our big anniversary!

148
00:10:18.916 --> 00:10:20.458
Surprise!

149
00:10:20.541 --> 00:10:22.750
We can afford "fancy?"

150
00:10:22.833 --> 00:10:24.416
That's why God invented credit cards.

151
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.291
And your mom's been working double shifts.

152
00:10:26.375 --> 00:10:27.541
And so she's earned it.

153
00:10:27.625 --> 00:10:29.791
Daddy had
a really good job interview today.

154
00:10:29.875 --> 00:10:32.958
He's going to land on his feet soon.
But the sitter is tied up. so...

155
00:10:33.041 --> 00:10:35.083
Oh. I'm not watching him this weekend.
No way.

156
00:10:35.166 --> 00:10:37.208
Don't you have an away game tomorrow?

157
00:10:37.291 --> 00:10:39.291
It's not a game. it's a meet.

158
00:10:39.375 --> 00:10:40.666
NATE'You're gonna win it.

159
00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:43.291
One of these days. you're gonna
get that full ride to college.

160
00:10:43.375 --> 00:10:44.916
Don't jinx me. Dad.

161
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.291
You always win!

162
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:48.250
NATE'He always wins.

163
00:10:48.333 --> 00:10:49.375
I could...

164
00:10:51.208 --> 00:10:53.625
I could stay at Libby's
mom's place tonight.

165
00:10:53.708 --> 00:10:56.916
Could you? Would that be too much trouble?

166
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.958
What? You would never let me
stay the night at a girl's house.

167
00:11:00.041 --> 00:11:01.041
You're not Nate.

168
00:11:02.291 --> 00:11:03.875
Nate's different.

169
00:11:15.666 --> 00:11:17.958
Okay. Let's go over the checklist.

170
00:11:18.041 --> 00:11:20.083
Did you take a series
of selfies at your house

171
00:11:20.166 --> 00:11:22.000
to post on Instagram
at strategic intervals?

172
00:11:22.083 --> 00:11:24.125
Yes. I have over 200 options.

173
00:11:24.208 --> 00:11:26.083
-Did you triple-feed your dog?
-Check.

174
00:11:26.166 --> 00:11:30.041
What do you say if the casting director
asked for our parents' phone numbers?

175
00:11:30.125 --> 00:11:31.458
We give them each other's.

176
00:11:31.541 --> 00:11:34.041
and I pretend to be your dad
if the casting people call.

177
00:11:34.125 --> 00:11:37.333
Correct. But you should probably
pretend to be my mom.

178
00:11:37.416 --> 00:11:40.291
Your voice hasn't changed yet.
Did you pack your headshot?

179
00:11:44.291 --> 00:11:47.250
Nate. that's a wallet-sized school photo

180
00:11:47.333 --> 00:11:49.208
from when you had your worst haircut.

181
00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:50.958
My dad doesn't have a job. Libby.

182
00:11:51.041 --> 00:11:53.625
We don't just have glossy
eight-by-tens ready to go.

183
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.041
Tone.

184
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.416
Okay. Lyft to the bus station
is almost here.

185
00:12:06.541 --> 00:12:08.166
What is happening right now?

186
00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:10.125
I've always wanted to climb out a window.

187
00:12:10.375 --> 00:12:13.791
Like the Tonight duet. on the fire escape.
in West Side Story.

188
00:12:14.541 --> 00:12:17.208
You want to break your ankle
before we get to this audition?

189
00:12:22.416 --> 00:12:23.791
Hey. Lib?

190
00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:27.166
Why are you doing all this for me?

191
00:12:28.375 --> 00:12:31.041
Because. it damages my clout.

192
00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:34.291
when my best friend isn't even cast
as Abraham Lincoln's understudy.

193
00:12:35.291 --> 00:12:38.416
And I figured you could use the mood lift.

194
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.000
Plus. my love language
is quality time. so...

195
00:12:41.625 --> 00:12:43.958
Did you just say you love me?

196
00:12:44.916 --> 00:12:48.416
The Lyft's going to be here
in. like. 12 seconds. Go.

197
00:12:56.666 --> 00:13:00.416
This is probably good practice
for the New York City transit system.

198
00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.250
Yeah. it is.

199
00:13:02.333 --> 00:13:04.333
How much were the bus tickets?
I'll Venmo you.

200
00:13:04.416 --> 00:13:07.291
You can pay me back
when you're a big Broadway star.

201
00:13:08.708 --> 00:13:10.208
Okay. folks...

202
00:13:10.291 --> 00:13:13.708
Also. I'm using your shoulder as a pillow
and you're dealing with it.

203
00:13:13.791 --> 00:13:16.875
My name is Elliot
and I will be your driver

204
00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.625
on route to New York City.

205
00:13:21.208 --> 00:13:22.500
Hey...

206
00:13:23.833 --> 00:13:25.833
-So. when we get there...
-Mmm-hmm.

207
00:13:26.166 --> 00:13:31.125
I know you kind of think of Times Square
as the 1950s Guys and Dolls fantasia.

208
00:13:31.208 --> 00:13:34.916
but people don't actually dance
in the street. They mug you.

209
00:13:35.041 --> 00:13:36.125
Hey.

210
00:13:36.208 --> 00:13:37.791
We may be small. but...

211
00:13:38.583 --> 00:13:39.875
But what?

212
00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.625
I'm trying to think of something.

213
00:13:41.708 --> 00:13:42.750
Exactly.

214
00:13:58.333 --> 00:14:01.000
Okay. Good evening. folks.

215
00:14:01.083 --> 00:14:03.833
Once again. my name is Elliot...

216
00:14:03.916 --> 00:14:05.125
Goodbye. Pittsburgh.

217
00:14:08.291 --> 00:14:10.958
New York City
will be the last stop tonight.

218
00:14:11.625 --> 00:14:15.375
So. sit back and please enjoy your ride.

219
00:14:16.416 --> 00:14:19.291
New York coming. people. Last stop.

220
00:14:19.416 --> 00:14:23.958
Last stop. Last stop. Last stop...

221
00:14:31.375 --> 00:14:34.541
I got my ticket in my pocket

222
00:14:35.125 --> 00:14:37.625
I got my heart here on my sleeve

223
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.791
Don't worry 'bout me 'cause I got this

224
00:14:42.625 --> 00:14:45.041
They're gonna regret doubting me

225
00:14:46.416 --> 00:14:49.666
The lights are bright. people are crazy

226
00:14:50.208 --> 00:14:52.500
I see it all through my window

227
00:14:53.833 --> 00:14:57.000
Buildings are tall. it doesn't faze me

228
00:14:57.625 --> 00:15:02.833
Don't gotta worry 'cause
I know. I know. I know that

229
00:15:02.916 --> 00:15:06.666
This is where I'm supposed to be

230
00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:09.875
I might be young. but I'm mighty

231
00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.833
So let the talkers talk

232
00:15:11.916 --> 00:15:13.541
They can say what they say

233
00:15:13.625 --> 00:15:17.250
They're gonna see my name in lights up
On the marquee one day

234
00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:21.291
I'm a do what I do
Make the city mine

235
00:15:21.375 --> 00:15:25.833
I might be small. but I'm
I'm headed to the big time

236
00:15:27.625 --> 00:15:30.000
I'm headed to the big time

237
00:15:30.291 --> 00:15:31.458
Ooh yeah

238
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.750
People are staring as I walk by

239
00:15:35.833 --> 00:15:36.833
Walk by

240
00:15:36.916 --> 00:15:39.458
They wonder if I've gone insane

241
00:15:39.541 --> 00:15:40.625
You crazy

242
00:15:40.708 --> 00:15:43.291
But I'll brush off every side eye

243
00:15:44.625 --> 00:15:46.541
Walk with a smile on my face

244
00:15:46.625 --> 00:15:47.958
'Cause I know. I know that

245
00:15:48.041 --> 00:15:51.791
This is where I'm supposed to be

246
00:15:51.875 --> 00:15:54.750
I might be young. but I'm mighty

247
00:15:54.833 --> 00:15:56.916
So let the talkers talk

248
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.666
They can say what they say

249
00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:02.125
They're gonna see my name in lights up
On the marquee one day

250
00:16:02.541 --> 00:16:05.958
I'm a do what I do
Make the city mine

251
00:16:06.041 --> 00:16:10.500
I might be small. but I'm
I'm headed to the big time

252
00:16:10.583 --> 00:16:12.583
Headed to the big time

253
00:16:12.666 --> 00:16:14.291
I'm headed to the big time

254
00:16:14.375 --> 00:16:16.375
Headed to the big time

255
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.333
I'll make you proud of me

256
00:16:43.416 --> 00:16:46.833
I swear I'm working hard

257
00:16:46.916 --> 00:16:48.750
I'm almost there

258
00:16:48.833 --> 00:16:53.083
And if I prove my worth
And prove everyone wrong

259
00:16:53.166 --> 00:16:57.625
Well. maybe then
I'll finally feel like I actually belong

260
00:16:57.708 --> 00:17:02.541
'Cause if I make it big
I won't get left behind

261
00:17:02.625 --> 00:17:06.291
So. yeah. I'm small. but I'm

262
00:17:08.083 --> 00:17:11.250
-This is where I'm supposed to be

263
00:17:11.333 --> 00:17:14.583
I might be young. but I'm mighty

264
00:17:14.666 --> 00:17:16.625
So let the talkers talk

265
00:17:16.708 --> 00:17:18.250
They can say what they say

266
00:17:18.333 --> 00:17:22.208
I'm gonna see my name in lights
Up on the marquee one day

267
00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:25.750
I'm a do what I do
Make the city mine

268
00:17:25.833 --> 00:17:30.750
I might be small. but I'm
I'm headed to the big time

269
00:17:36.083 --> 00:17:37.916
I'm headed to the big time

270
00:17:38.166 --> 00:17:39.625
Nate. Nate.

271
00:17:40.333 --> 00:17:41.958
-Nate.

272
00:17:42.041 --> 00:17:43.333
-Nate!
-Big time.

273
00:17:44.416 --> 00:17:47.333
You were drooling and singing.
It was incredible.

274
00:17:48.708 --> 00:17:49.708
Look.

275
00:18:08.083 --> 00:18:09.166
It's great.

276
00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:10.750
It's glorious.

277
00:18:11.583 --> 00:18:13.541
Operation Broadway. step two.

278
00:18:16.541 --> 00:18:17.625
Oh! Post that one.

279
00:18:17.708 --> 00:18:20.166
Where you're clipping your dog's nails
in your kitchen.

280
00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:21.708
You look especially innocent.

281
00:18:21.791 --> 00:18:23.041
Tourists.

282
00:18:23.125 --> 00:18:24.291
Thank you!

283
00:18:26.458 --> 00:18:27.583
Oh. no!

284
00:18:30.208 --> 00:18:31.208
Come on!

285
00:18:43.291 --> 00:18:45.000
Maybe we should just turn around.

286
00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:46.333
My hair doesn't do wet.

287
00:18:46.416 --> 00:18:48.625
We just got here. Live a little.

288
00:18:48.875 --> 00:18:52.375
Oh. look at you quoting me. I'll allow it.

289
00:18:57.375 --> 00:19:00.791
Hello. We are here to audition
for Lilo & Stitch.

290
00:19:02.125 --> 00:19:05.083
The musical. The Broadway musical.

291
00:19:05.166 --> 00:19:06.583
First time in New York.

292
00:19:06.666 --> 00:19:09.500
-Yeah. how could you...
-That wasn't a question.

293
00:19:12.416 --> 00:19:13.541
Go on.

294
00:19:35.166 --> 00:19:37.458
And what do we say
if they ask how old we are?

295
00:19:37.541 --> 00:19:40.916
I say. "However old the character
Lilo is in the script."

296
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.291
And then I wink.

297
00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:46.458
Okay.

298
00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:51.291
The casting director!
This is so cool!

299
00:19:51.375 --> 00:19:52.791
Let's cast a musical.

300
00:20:00.041 --> 00:20:05.750
We are expecting 1.000 kids
in the next 24 hours.

301
00:20:05.833 --> 00:20:09.291
so. I need the first 25 kids
to look at their numbers

302
00:20:09.375 --> 00:20:14.625
and line themselves up against
this mirrored wall in ascending order.

303
00:20:14.708 --> 00:20:17.041
I didn't realize
there'd be math on this test.

304
00:20:17.125 --> 00:20:18.875
And just a reminder.

305
00:20:19.041 --> 00:20:23.291
You must indicate in the application
if you are allergic to macadamia nuts.

306
00:20:23.375 --> 00:20:25.000
Hawaii. Big subplot.

307
00:20:30.208 --> 00:20:31.375
Amateur.

308
00:20:33.291 --> 00:20:35.291
And most important.

309
00:20:35.375 --> 00:20:38.166
if you are under 18.
I need you to sign in

310
00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:42.125
with a physically present parent
or guardian today.

311
00:20:42.208 --> 00:20:44.625
or you will not be auditioning.

312
00:20:44.708 --> 00:20:47.666
No "ifs." "ands." or "buts."

313
00:20:51.041 --> 00:20:52.375
-Next.

314
00:20:56.958 --> 00:20:58.958
You ready to set some records. bro?

315
00:20:59.041 --> 00:21:00.666
Yeah. For sure.

316
00:21:11.125 --> 00:21:12.208
You good?

317
00:21:12.916 --> 00:21:15.541
I feel like I'm missing something.

318
00:21:27.375 --> 00:21:28.708
Whatever. let's bounce.

319
00:21:29.666 --> 00:21:33.291
How's Gibby doing?
Actually don't tell me.

320
00:21:36.958 --> 00:21:38.583
You have a cell phone down here?

321
00:21:38.666 --> 00:21:40.666
You're not supposed to have
a cell phone here.

322
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:43.291
Look what Natey just posted.

323
00:21:43.833 --> 00:21:45.958
He's clipping the dog's nails.

324
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.208
There you go.

325
00:21:48.291 --> 00:21:51.458
Our boys can survive
for one weekend without us.

326
00:21:51.541 --> 00:21:54.416
Now let's please try to relax...

327
00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:00.416
It's the tricep again. ma'am.
You gotta lay off the triceps.

328
00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:03.208
-Don't forget to breathe.

329
00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:07.958
Try not to hyperventilate.
We'll figure something out.

330
00:22:12.916 --> 00:22:14.833
You don't have
your lucky rabbit foot.

331
00:22:14.916 --> 00:22:16.375
Jimmy Madison took it.

332
00:22:16.458 --> 00:22:18.625
I hope karma hits him
in the form of a bus.

333
00:22:18.875 --> 00:22:20.625
I mean. a metaphorical bus.

334
00:22:20.916 --> 00:22:24.333
obviously. I'm against violence
at a core level. but...

335
00:22:24.416 --> 00:22:28.833
You're distracting my kid.
She needs to concentrate.

336
00:22:28.916 --> 00:22:32.125
His blood sugar's low. show some respect.

337
00:22:33.208 --> 00:22:35.375
Have you done character work before?

338
00:22:35.458 --> 00:22:37.708
Have I... I'm sorry. what?

339
00:22:37.791 --> 00:22:40.625
Have you done
costume character work before?

340
00:22:40.708 --> 00:22:45.333
I played a snow-man in a full body suit
in the Radio City Christmas Spectacular.

341
00:22:45.875 --> 00:22:47.000
Twice.

342
00:22:47.541 --> 00:22:50.291
I turned it down the third year.
so I wouldn't be pigeon-holed

343
00:22:50.375 --> 00:22:51.583
as not having a face.

344
00:22:51.666 --> 00:22:54.041
That's incredible.

345
00:22:54.125 --> 00:22:56.041
Yes. Yes. it is.

346
00:22:56.166 --> 00:22:57.166
Good luck!

347
00:22:57.916 --> 00:23:00.125
You're supposed to say. "break a leg."

348
00:23:00.208 --> 00:23:01.250
Next!

349
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.416
Are you here for the audition?

350
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:07.208
Funny you should ask that. madam.

351
00:23:07.291 --> 00:23:09.666
You bet! We drove all night to be here.

352
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:12.375
I mean. we didn't drive. My mom did.
We're children.

353
00:23:12.458 --> 00:23:15.458
I mean. if you needed us
to learn to drive a car for the show

354
00:23:15.541 --> 00:23:17.541
for any reason. we're very fast learners.

355
00:23:17.625 --> 00:23:19.083
Really?

356
00:23:19.166 --> 00:23:23.000
Because the competition
seems to think you're flying solo.

357
00:23:26.916 --> 00:23:28.750
First group of kids are on deck.

358
00:23:28.833 --> 00:23:30.000
One sec.

359
00:23:30.083 --> 00:23:32.833
Uh. listen up. everybody.

360
00:23:32.916 --> 00:23:36.333
Unless you have a parent
or guardian with you.

361
00:23:36.416 --> 00:23:41.041
please do not waste your time. or ours.

362
00:23:44.291 --> 00:23:45.375
Nathan.

363
00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:47.541
Foster?

364
00:23:48.208 --> 00:23:49.958
Aunt Heidi.

365
00:23:50.041 --> 00:23:53.250
It is you. Okay. Okay.

366
00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:55.333
We're with her.

367
00:23:55.416 --> 00:23:57.375
This is incredible.

368
00:23:57.583 --> 00:24:00.958
I was this close
to not even coming to this audition today.

369
00:24:01.041 --> 00:24:05.208
And then something in me was like.
"Do it. Heidi."

370
00:24:05.333 --> 00:24:06.333
and then. this.

371
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.125
-It's like. you're a sign.
-Thank you.

372
00:24:10.208 --> 00:24:12.916
I've been called many names in my life.
but "sign" is a first.

373
00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:16.375
Wait. You're auditioning
for Lilo & Stitch too?

374
00:24:16.458 --> 00:24:18.166
Oh. no. Oh. no.

375
00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:19.875
I'm... No. I'm two doors down.

376
00:24:19.958 --> 00:24:23.625
Yeah. Did you see all those ladies
trying to still pass for mid-thirties?

377
00:24:23.708 --> 00:24:27.958
Yeah. we're all up for the same play.
It's called A Solitary Woman.

378
00:24:28.041 --> 00:24:29.166
Perfect for it.

379
00:24:30.791 --> 00:24:32.125
So...

380
00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:35.125
Yeah. So. where is your mom?
Is she in the bathroom or?

381
00:24:37.833 --> 00:24:39.000
All these years

382
00:24:39.083 --> 00:24:43.250
of her judging me for following my dreams
and being the black sheep.

383
00:24:43.333 --> 00:24:45.708
and she's bringing you to an audition?

384
00:24:45.791 --> 00:24:47.791
Ah! Love it.

385
00:24:48.291 --> 00:24:51.958
And I love that you're still acting.
I'm not surprised. I'm not.

386
00:24:52.041 --> 00:24:55.250
Because you were the only toddler
whose first word was "Me."

387
00:24:57.083 --> 00:24:59.250
Isn't that funny? Is this your girlfriend?

388
00:24:59.333 --> 00:25:00.708
-No!
-We haven't chosen a label

389
00:25:00.791 --> 00:25:03.166
-at this point in our relationship.
-Okay.

390
00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:06.250
I'm just so happy to see you.

391
00:25:06.958 --> 00:25:07.958
Mom's not here.

392
00:25:08.583 --> 00:25:09.708
-Nate!
-What?

393
00:25:09.791 --> 00:25:11.666
It was bound to come out
in three minutes.

394
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:14.291
Wait! So... But okay.
What do you mean she's not here?

395
00:25:14.375 --> 00:25:15.791
So who brought you? Your dad?

396
00:25:15.875 --> 00:25:19.000
No! He thinks Broadway
is a four letter word.

397
00:25:19.083 --> 00:25:20.333
Okay. wait.

398
00:25:20.416 --> 00:25:23.541
-So you're telling me...
-We ran away from home. lady.

399
00:25:24.208 --> 00:25:25.208
Oh.

400
00:25:26.166 --> 00:25:27.166
Um...

401
00:25:27.541 --> 00:25:28.666
Right. okay.

402
00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:33.875
All right. so. yeah.
responsible adult mode.

403
00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:38.166
My greatest acting role yet.

404
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.916
Um... Whoo!

405
00:25:42.625 --> 00:25:45.041
"Hi. Sherrie. it's your sister.

406
00:25:45.958 --> 00:25:48.083
"I know. it's been a couple years.

407
00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.000
"Okay. ten. I guess..."

408
00:25:51.958 --> 00:25:53.833
Why don't I have your mom's cell?

409
00:25:53.916 --> 00:25:56.250
'Cause it's been a while
since you've spoken.

410
00:25:56.333 --> 00:25:58.541
Heidi didn't show up
to my parents' wedding.

411
00:25:58.625 --> 00:26:00.500
She was the maid of honor and everything.

412
00:26:00.583 --> 00:26:02.041
Wow. that's deep.

413
00:26:02.375 --> 00:26:03.666
Yeah. well...

414
00:26:06.583 --> 00:26:09.708
And I just missed my audition.

415
00:26:09.791 --> 00:26:12.375
so. that's awesome.

416
00:26:12.458 --> 00:26:15.666
I can't believe
you still have to audition for things.

417
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:17.208
You've been on Broadway.

418
00:26:17.625 --> 00:26:19.958
You have no idea. kid.

419
00:26:20.041 --> 00:26:22.291
All right. What's your mom's cell?
Spill it.

420
00:26:22.375 --> 00:26:27.875
It's 4-1-2-5-5-5-8-7-2-0.

421
00:26:28.833 --> 00:26:30.708
Zero. Okay.

422
00:26:35.041 --> 00:26:38.333
Your call has been forwarded
to an automatic voice message system.

423
00:26:38.416 --> 00:26:40.833
At the tone. please record your message.

424
00:26:41.875 --> 00:26:47.583
Hi. Sherrie. I'm with my nephew.
Your son. Nathan.

425
00:26:47.666 --> 00:26:49.666
-Nate.
-Nate.

426
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:51.750
He is alive.

427
00:26:51.833 --> 00:26:55.125
Well. he's 12 seconds away
from being murdered by his aunt.

428
00:26:55.791 --> 00:26:57.083
But. you know. he's fine.

429
00:26:57.166 --> 00:27:02.291
He is fine and I'm gonna get him
on the next airplane...

430
00:27:02.375 --> 00:27:05.000
-Bus. We can't afford an airplane.
-...home.

431
00:27:05.083 --> 00:27:08.791
And. you know. maybe someday.
we can all laugh at this.

432
00:27:10.125 --> 00:27:12.750
If there is a world
where we ever speak again.

433
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.625
Okay. bye-bye. now.

434
00:27:26.125 --> 00:27:27.958
Incredible work.

435
00:27:28.083 --> 00:27:29.250
Excuse me?

436
00:27:29.333 --> 00:27:31.625
I truly believed you cared about her.

437
00:27:31.708 --> 00:27:34.416
I'm with Nate. I can't believe
you have to audition for things.

438
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.541
Please.

439
00:27:35.625 --> 00:27:38.416
Okay. first group
of kids for Lilo! Let's do this.

440
00:27:41.208 --> 00:27:42.833
All right. let's get outta here.

441
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.250
-Oh! Oh!
-What's this?

442
00:27:46.791 --> 00:27:48.500
It's his pee dance. It's a thing.

443
00:27:48.583 --> 00:27:49.666
Libby!

444
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:52.833
Okay. well. just go fast. okay?

445
00:27:52.916 --> 00:27:55.000
-That's not good for your bladder.
-Go!

446
00:27:56.958 --> 00:27:59.958
-Is he always like this?
-Hilarious? Yes.

447
00:28:00.791 --> 00:28:02.166
Takes after me.

448
00:28:03.166 --> 00:28:06.791
Do I have everybody?
Where's number 13?

449
00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:17.333
Where's the bathroom?

450
00:28:17.416 --> 00:28:18.625
-Back in the left.
-Cool.

451
00:28:26.708 --> 00:28:30.000
Today. we're not looking for people
to act opposite a puppet.

452
00:28:30.833 --> 00:28:34.500
The role of Stitch
will require a versatile child

453
00:28:34.583 --> 00:28:38.291
whose performance will need
to read through a full bodysuit.

454
00:28:39.291 --> 00:28:42.291
We are seeking both a Lilo and a Stitch.

455
00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:46.666
If you can dance in either of these roles.
all the better.

456
00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:50.375
And you cannot be afraid of heights.
I should add.

457
00:28:50.458 --> 00:28:54.583
There will be a big. power ballad moment

458
00:28:54.666 --> 00:28:58.208
that takes place
literally above the audience's head.

459
00:28:58.291 --> 00:29:01.458
where Stitch pilots the plane
through the mountains of Honolulu.

460
00:29:03.416 --> 00:29:05.416
Yeah. thank you.

461
00:29:09.666 --> 00:29:12.666
-You don't want something to eat. do you?
-I'm good.

462
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.041
-Good. Okay.
-Yeah.

463
00:29:30.375 --> 00:29:31.458
Let's try that again.

464
00:29:32.041 --> 00:29:34.958
Imagine you're seeing
a blue dog-like alien

465
00:29:35.041 --> 00:29:38.125
for the first time in your life
and it makes you scream.

466
00:29:46.458 --> 00:29:48.875
Yeah... No. For sure. Hard agree.

467
00:29:49.708 --> 00:29:51.416
Before I make
the first cut.

468
00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:54.250
does anyone have a special skill
they'd like to demonstrate?

469
00:29:54.333 --> 00:29:56.708
"Make the first cut."
All we did was scream.

470
00:29:56.791 --> 00:29:58.375
I am an award winning tumbler.

471
00:29:58.458 --> 00:30:00.416
Is that so. number six?

472
00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:03.500
Yes. I'm the reigning
Junior Mister Northeast Flipper.

473
00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:22.583
Fine. Any other Mary Lou Rettons
in the room?

474
00:30:26.625 --> 00:30:28.208
Oh. uh. Garret.

475
00:30:29.208 --> 00:30:30.875
I can sorta dance.

476
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.541
I mean. not like that.
that was ridiculous.

477
00:30:33.625 --> 00:30:35.541
But I can do knee crawls.

478
00:30:35.916 --> 00:30:36.916
Knee crawls?

479
00:30:37.125 --> 00:30:39.458
Yeah. like Fiddler on the Roof style
knee crawls.

480
00:30:40.541 --> 00:30:44.291
I was a bottle dancer
in an off-off Broadway production.

481
00:30:44.458 --> 00:30:46.208
In my friend's basement.

482
00:30:46.291 --> 00:30:48.791
In Pittsburgh.
I'm going to shut up now.

483
00:30:49.583 --> 00:30:51.000
Give him a chance.

484
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:53.875
Well.

485
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.416
this. I have to see.

486
00:30:55.541 --> 00:30:57.708
Okay. pretend I have a bottle on my head.

487
00:30:57.791 --> 00:30:59.875
-Got it.
-And a beard.

488
00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:03.541
Mazel tov!

489
00:31:05.208 --> 00:31:07.500
-Oh. my gosh! My pants!
-Your pants?

490
00:31:07.583 --> 00:31:10.541
Yeah. I got caught in the rain
and I think my pants shrunk

491
00:31:10.625 --> 00:31:13.541
and now they're way too tight for me
to do my knee crawl things.

492
00:31:13.625 --> 00:31:15.833
Does anybody have any extra shorts?

493
00:31:15.916 --> 00:31:18.458
That won't be necessary.

494
00:31:18.541 --> 00:31:22.041
For the record. I have a ton of phobias.
but heights isn't one of them.

495
00:31:25.083 --> 00:31:26.541
I think we can make the cut.

496
00:31:30.208 --> 00:31:32.625
-Good try.
-Thanks. number 12.

497
00:31:34.166 --> 00:31:37.541
Okay. I'm gonna say this one more time.

498
00:31:37.625 --> 00:31:41.958
This is not personal.
And you're all sensational.

499
00:31:42.041 --> 00:31:47.041
It's like I'm looking at
Juilliard Drama class of 2027.

500
00:31:50.041 --> 00:31:52.416
All right. If I don't read your number.

501
00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.333
I will see you on...

502
00:31:54.416 --> 00:31:57.458
The next one.
Like there will even be a next one.

503
00:31:57.541 --> 00:32:00.750
Cut at my first and last
Broadway audition.

504
00:32:00.833 --> 00:32:03.166
That's going to be
the name of my memoir title.

505
00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:06.083
Hey. At least you got to audition. right?

506
00:32:06.166 --> 00:32:08.375
Yeah. By breaking into the audition

507
00:32:08.458 --> 00:32:11.166
and lying to your aunt. by the way.

508
00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:14.416
Okay. it is so weird to me
that your mom's only response

509
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:16.583
to my voicemail is a thumbs up emoji.

510
00:32:16.666 --> 00:32:18.125
That's not so weird.

511
00:32:18.208 --> 00:32:21.416
And it's an African-American
thumbs up emoji.

512
00:32:23.041 --> 00:32:24.708
Her hand must have slipped.

513
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:28.500
- Good afternoon.
- 00 p.m. to Pittsburgh now boarding.

514
00:32:28.583 --> 00:32:30.583
00 p.m. to Pittsburgh.

515
00:32:31.541 --> 00:32:34.541
Well. I may have missed my audition.

516
00:32:34.625 --> 00:32:38.625
but I refuse to miss the most
well-paying Bar Mitzvah in U.S. history.

517
00:32:38.708 --> 00:32:39.875
so I should go.

518
00:32:40.208 --> 00:32:41.458
Wait. you're a rabbi now?

519
00:32:41.958 --> 00:32:43.208
Ha. Ignoring that.

520
00:32:43.291 --> 00:32:46.083
No. I have to be at the Natural
History Museum in 20 minutes.

521
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:48.833
Ah. Yes. dinosaurs.

522
00:32:48.916 --> 00:32:52.208
Well. I'm just catering.
So. don't be jealous.

523
00:32:53.208 --> 00:32:55.666
I would trade my entire life
with you right now.

524
00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:57.666
if I could be a caterer in New York.

525
00:32:58.416 --> 00:33:02.875
One day. Nate. I have complete confidence
that you'll be a caterer in New York.

526
00:33:03.333 --> 00:33:06.416
In the meantime.
middle school is calling your name.

527
00:33:13.708 --> 00:33:15.875
-For the record...
-Yeah?

528
00:33:16.041 --> 00:33:18.458
I totally understand why
you missed the wedding.

529
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.500
You had your first-ever Broadway callback.

530
00:33:24.125 --> 00:33:25.875
I would have done the same thing.

531
00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:28.958
I... Uh...

532
00:33:29.916 --> 00:33:31.041
Um...

533
00:33:31.125 --> 00:33:32.208
Tell...

534
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.208
I gotta go. What am I doing? All right.

535
00:33:40.166 --> 00:33:43.083
You two...
You take care of each other. right?

536
00:33:46.333 --> 00:33:48.208
Yes. good. Good.

537
00:33:54.208 --> 00:33:57.625
- Final boarding- 00 p.m.
Port Authority to Pittsburgh.

538
00:33:57.708 --> 00:33:58.833
Final boarding.

539
00:34:08.375 --> 00:34:10.958
So if I'm reading the room.

540
00:34:11.041 --> 00:34:14.625
Kalea is our top contender for Lilo.

541
00:34:14.708 --> 00:34:18.500
Adore her energy.
She is already on vocal rest.

542
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:22.041
So. this is that afternoon
callback group then.

543
00:34:22.125 --> 00:34:23.208
Yes!

544
00:34:25.625 --> 00:34:26.791
Hold on!

545
00:34:28.208 --> 00:34:29.208
Where's the kid?

546
00:34:29.416 --> 00:34:32.291
Which kid? These are all kids.

547
00:34:32.375 --> 00:34:33.541
The weird funny one.

548
00:34:34.625 --> 00:34:37.208
The Fiddler on the Roof bottle dance boy?

549
00:34:37.291 --> 00:34:38.333
You liked that kid?

550
00:34:38.416 --> 00:34:40.250
He was like my favorite kid.

551
00:34:40.333 --> 00:34:43.458
He referred to Pittsburgh
as "off-off Broadway."

552
00:34:43.541 --> 00:34:45.000
He was spunky.

553
00:34:45.083 --> 00:34:47.500
I don't think we even
got his contact info. So...

554
00:34:47.583 --> 00:34:52.500
Not true! His friend left this with me.
Phone number's on the back.

555
00:34:56.500 --> 00:35:02.083
That is the worst haircut
I've seen in 32 years of casting.

556
00:35:04.375 --> 00:35:06.291
Well. today could have been better.

557
00:35:06.375 --> 00:35:08.208
Today could have been worse.

558
00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:30.416
Driver. stop the bus!

559
00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:31.791
What are you doing?

560
00:35:31.875 --> 00:35:35.000
I got a callback.
I have to be there in like 20 minutes.

561
00:35:35.083 --> 00:35:37.750
You got a... Wait. what?

562
00:35:38.208 --> 00:35:39.625
Hello? Someone getting off?

563
00:35:40.541 --> 00:35:42.333
This wasn't a part of the plan.

564
00:35:42.416 --> 00:35:44.583
But we do everything together!

565
00:35:44.666 --> 00:35:46.333
Which is exactly my point!

566
00:35:46.541 --> 00:35:48.125
Tone.

567
00:35:50.291 --> 00:35:53.583
If I'm gone any longer.
and my parents figure it out.

568
00:35:53.666 --> 00:35:55.750
they're going to ground me. For life!

569
00:35:55.833 --> 00:35:56.958
Are you...

570
00:35:57.041 --> 00:35:59.583
Libby. are you mad
that I auditioned without you?

571
00:35:59.666 --> 00:36:01.291
No. I...

572
00:36:01.375 --> 00:36:03.750
Nate. I love the theater.

573
00:36:03.833 --> 00:36:06.875
But I don't really love being onstage.

574
00:36:06.958 --> 00:36:09.166
I'm still trying to find my thing.

575
00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:14.250
And I kind of only do the school shows
to be with...

576
00:36:15.583 --> 00:36:16.750
You know?

577
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:21.000
With you.

578
00:36:25.041 --> 00:36:26.541
Make a decision. kids.

579
00:36:27.791 --> 00:36:31.125
Libby. you know how much
you mean to me.

580
00:36:31.958 --> 00:36:34.708
but I'm not like that.

581
00:36:41.375 --> 00:36:43.375
Honey. let him go.

582
00:36:44.166 --> 00:36:46.458
I'll explain to you on the ride home.

583
00:36:47.625 --> 00:36:49.958
Are you stayin' on.
or are you gettin' off?

584
00:36:51.958 --> 00:36:54.000
I'm really sorry. Lib.

585
00:36:56.333 --> 00:36:57.458
No. I...

586
00:37:00.541 --> 00:37:02.208
I've been there. sweetheart.

587
00:37:02.291 --> 00:37:04.125
And I married the guy!

588
00:37:26.583 --> 00:37:27.791
The rabbit foot worked!

589
00:37:34.958 --> 00:37:37.291
Nate! You still at Libby's?

590
00:37:38.125 --> 00:37:39.333
I'm home!

591
00:37:40.166 --> 00:37:43.375
Hey. do we have any Ace bandages
in dad's medicine cabinet?

592
00:37:45.208 --> 00:37:46.208
Yo!

593
00:37:47.041 --> 00:37:48.041
Nate!

594
00:37:59.125 --> 00:38:00.208
Ow!

595
00:38:06.916 --> 00:38:08.208
"Hanging with Lib.

596
00:38:08.291 --> 00:38:10.875
"Congrats on probably
getting first place."

597
00:38:10.958 --> 00:38:12.791
First place. Yeah.

598
00:38:19.666 --> 00:38:22.375
-Dude. Party tonight.
-Dude.

599
00:38:22.458 --> 00:38:25.208
-I can barely walk.
-That's why we're coming to you.

600
00:38:25.541 --> 00:38:28.166
We want to cheer you up
for biffing out there today.

601
00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:31.000
Aren't your parents away
on their woo-woo retreat thing?

602
00:38:31.083 --> 00:38:32.791
-Dude. I don't know.
-Dude...

603
00:38:32.875 --> 00:38:35.208
Can I come make your boo-boo better?

604
00:38:36.875 --> 00:38:39.125
Yeah. okay. it's on.

605
00:38:39.458 --> 00:38:40.833
Yes.

606
00:38:42.166 --> 00:38:43.458
All right. later.

607
00:39:09.666 --> 00:39:10.666
Weird.

608
00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:17.916
Let the storm rage on!

609
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.250
The cold never bothered me anyway

610
00:39:23.875 --> 00:39:27.416
I've never had a boy sing Let It Go.
I'll give you that.

611
00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:28.916
Thank you so much.

612
00:39:30.291 --> 00:39:31.583
Crazy question. Nate.

613
00:39:31.666 --> 00:39:34.416
but did you happen to bring
a monologue with you today?

614
00:39:35.125 --> 00:39:38.083
-Monologue?
-Yeah. like a short speech.

615
00:39:38.166 --> 00:39:40.041
Emphasis on "short."

616
00:39:40.125 --> 00:39:43.750
Oh. no. I know what a monologue is.
I just didn't...

617
00:39:43.833 --> 00:39:46.208
Okay. no problem. That's all we need.

618
00:39:46.291 --> 00:39:48.500
Wait. I have something. I do.

619
00:39:51.958 --> 00:39:55.083
"The night the lights
went out in Georgia."

620
00:39:56.625 --> 00:39:59.958
Can't say I've heard of that one.
but if you wanna give it a try...

621
00:40:00.041 --> 00:40:01.875
"You probably didn't know. Marjorie.

622
00:40:02.458 --> 00:40:06.625
"that Suzanne was the only contestant
in Georgia pageant history

623
00:40:06.708 --> 00:40:11.791
"to sweep every category
except congeniality.

624
00:40:11.875 --> 00:40:15.750
"and that is not something
the women in my family aspire to anyway.

625
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.875
"Or that when she walked down
the runway in her swimsuit.

626
00:40:20.958 --> 00:40:24.750
"five contestants quit on the spot.

627
00:40:24.833 --> 00:40:28.250
"Or that when she emerged
from the isolation booth

628
00:40:28.333 --> 00:40:31.375
"to answer the question.
'What would you do to prevent war?'

629
00:40:31.458 --> 00:40:35.541
"she spoke so eloquently of patriotism.

630
00:40:35.625 --> 00:40:39.791
"battlefields. and diamond tiaras.
grown men wept."

631
00:40:40.625 --> 00:40:41.958
Okay.

632
00:40:42.041 --> 00:40:44.208
"And you probably didn't know.

633
00:40:44.291 --> 00:40:49.208
"Marjorie. that Suzanne
was not just any Miss Georgia.

634
00:40:49.291 --> 00:40:53.750
"She was the Miss Georgia.

635
00:40:53.833 --> 00:40:56.875
"She didn't just twirl a baton.

636
00:40:56.958 --> 00:40:58.875
"that baton was on fire!

637
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.416
"And when she threw that baton
into the air. it flew higher.

638
00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:08.333
"further. faster than any baton
has ever flown before.

639
00:41:08.416 --> 00:41:14.000
"hitting a transformer and showering
the darkened arena with sparks.

640
00:41:15.541 --> 00:41:20.875
"And when it finally
did come down. Marjorie.

641
00:41:21.791 --> 00:41:25.791
"my sister caught that baton

642
00:41:25.875 --> 00:41:29.916
"as 12.000 people jumped to their feet

643
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.250
"for 16 and one-half minutes
of uninterrupted. thunderous ovation

644
00:41:34.333 --> 00:41:38.750
"as flames illuminated
her tear-stained face.

645
00:41:38.833 --> 00:41:40.750
-"And that..."

646
00:41:41.875 --> 00:41:45.583
"Marjorie. just so you will know

647
00:41:45.666 --> 00:41:49.375
"and your children will someday know.

648
00:41:49.458 --> 00:41:53.541
"is the night the lights
went out in Georgia!"

649
00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:59.083
And scene.

650
00:42:01.375 --> 00:42:04.625
Sorry. my Southern accent
was a little wobbly. Weird.

651
00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:06.708
Was that Edward Albee?

652
00:42:06.958 --> 00:42:09.041
Close. Designing Women.

653
00:42:11.833 --> 00:42:13.583
Nate. are you local?

654
00:42:15.083 --> 00:42:17.916
Are you already spending the night
in New York? I mean...

655
00:42:18.375 --> 00:42:19.625
Um...

656
00:42:19.708 --> 00:42:21.791
Look. can you be back tomorrow?

657
00:42:23.083 --> 00:42:24.583
I think the director should meet you.

658
00:42:27.416 --> 00:42:30.125
Can you run out
and give his mother the info?

659
00:42:30.208 --> 00:42:31.375
You can just tell me.

660
00:42:31.791 --> 00:42:35.958
Mom's probably wandering the halls.
or something. looking for celebrities.

661
00:42:36.041 --> 00:42:38.250
-You can remember all the details?
-Of course.

662
00:42:39.041 --> 00:42:40.625
I have a pornographic memory.

663
00:42:43.875 --> 00:42:49.291
Tomorrow at the New Amsterdam Theatre
on West 41st Street.

664
00:42:49.375 --> 00:42:52.833
Come to the stage door
at30 a.m. sharp. okay?

665
00:42:53.208 --> 00:42:55.000
That's where The Lion King opened.

666
00:42:55.916 --> 00:42:57.416
Is that a question?

667
00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:58.500
No.

668
00:42:59.375 --> 00:43:02.625
Sorry. do you mind
if I exit out the window?

669
00:43:03.541 --> 00:43:06.583
The West Side Story balcony scene
is on my bucket list.

670
00:43:06.666 --> 00:43:09.500
We're on the fourth floor
and there's no fire escape.

671
00:43:09.583 --> 00:43:11.916
Oh. yeah. that makes sense.

672
00:43:15.791 --> 00:43:16.833
Mom!

673
00:43:16.916 --> 00:43:18.500
Send in the next kid.

674
00:43:18.583 --> 00:43:20.208
-Where are you. Mom?

675
00:43:29.208 --> 00:43:31.125
Yes. yes. yes!

676
00:43:39.625 --> 00:43:40.625
Libby.

677
00:43:42.708 --> 00:43:46.583
"You'll never believe..."

678
00:43:48.916 --> 00:43:50.125
I don't believe this.

679
00:44:10.833 --> 00:44:12.208
Hmm...

680
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.333
Next in line!

681
00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:23.500
Would you like to make a donation
to help children with leukemia?

682
00:44:23.583 --> 00:44:26.291
No. thank you. Would you
like to make a donation to children

683
00:44:26.375 --> 00:44:29.458
who don't have a place to sleep tonight?

684
00:44:29.541 --> 00:44:30.583
You're short.

685
00:44:30.708 --> 00:44:34.208
-Excuse me?
-You're a dollar short.

686
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.458
Look. I really need to buy
a phone charger.

687
00:44:44.791 --> 00:44:46.375
Next in line!

688
00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:54.083
I'm not the praying kind
but I'm gonna pray for you. ma'am.

689
00:45:59.708 --> 00:46:01.875
On Broadway

690
00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:08.916
They say there's always magic in the air

691
00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:15.291
But when you're walking down that street

692
00:46:16.041 --> 00:46:19.208
And you ain't had enough to eat

693
00:46:20.333 --> 00:46:25.166
One thin dime won't even shine your shoes

694
00:46:27.083 --> 00:46:30.083
Hey. now. keep up the good work. kid.

695
00:46:34.333 --> 00:46:35.916
You're sounding good.

696
00:46:46.416 --> 00:46:52.291
They say that I won't last too long
on Broadway

697
00:46:54.291 --> 00:46:59.208
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home
They all say

698
00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:05.041
Hey! But they dead wrong
I know they are

699
00:47:05.583 --> 00:47:09.041
'Cause I can play this here guitar

700
00:47:09.416 --> 00:47:15.458
And I won't quit till I'm a star
On Broadway

701
00:47:16.125 --> 00:47:17.291
Play it. fellas!

702
00:47:30.083 --> 00:47:34.750
On Broadway!

703
00:47:35.375 --> 00:47:40.250
On Broadway!

704
00:47:43.416 --> 00:47:44.625
Hey!

705
00:47:58.083 --> 00:47:59.500
I'm happy to take requests.

706
00:47:59.583 --> 00:48:01.916
Do you know anything from
Fiddler on the Roof?

707
00:48:02.125 --> 00:48:03.333
Do I?

708
00:48:05.083 --> 00:48:06.500
Mazel tov!

709
00:48:10.625 --> 00:48:12.166
Next in line!

710
00:48:13.125 --> 00:48:14.208
Hello.

711
00:48:16.125 --> 00:48:18.333
Funds have been raised.

712
00:48:18.625 --> 00:48:22.083
I will be paying for this.
with quarters and dimes.

713
00:48:29.333 --> 00:48:32.666
I will also be purchasing this coat.

714
00:48:34.583 --> 00:48:36.458
-Get away from her.
-No.

715
00:48:36.708 --> 00:48:37.916
What did you say?

716
00:48:38.541 --> 00:48:40.875
O'hana means "family."

717
00:48:42.083 --> 00:48:46.375
-"Family" means nobody...
-Nobody gets left behind.

718
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.833
-Hi.
-Hi!

719
00:49:08.916 --> 00:49:10.916
-Hi.
-Hi.

720
00:49:13.291 --> 00:49:16.875
-So. about what went down on the bus...

721
00:49:16.958 --> 00:49:18.416
What is all that noise?

722
00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:21.208
Where in the name of
Stephen Joshua Sondheim are you?

723
00:49:21.291 --> 00:49:22.916
New York City.

724
00:49:23.416 --> 00:49:26.708
Still. Libby. I got a final callback.

725
00:49:26.833 --> 00:49:29.541
for tomorrow.
and it's at the New Amsterdam Theatre.

726
00:49:29.625 --> 00:49:31.791
But that's only
if I don't get killed first.

727
00:49:31.875 --> 00:49:34.291
I called Aunt Heidi.
it went right to voicemail

728
00:49:34.375 --> 00:49:36.083
and I don't know where she lives.

729
00:49:36.166 --> 00:49:39.166
and I have no idea where
I'm going to sleep tonight.

730
00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:41.708
Nate. Nate. stop spinning.

731
00:49:42.208 --> 00:49:45.791
Your aunt's probably still at the museum
doing that bar mitzvah thing.

732
00:49:45.875 --> 00:49:47.708
Just find her there.

733
00:49:51.041 --> 00:49:52.916
Okay. see...

734
00:49:53.833 --> 00:49:57.833
This is why I love you.

735
00:49:59.875 --> 00:50:04.791
I really do. And just. look.
you've had my back from day one.

736
00:50:04.875 --> 00:50:08.041
and even if you don't like
being on stage. Lib.

737
00:50:08.416 --> 00:50:10.416
you're still a star.

738
00:50:12.333 --> 00:50:13.791
I still need you.

739
00:50:14.458 --> 00:50:18.458
And when you find the thing that you love.
I'll be cheering for you.

740
00:50:27.208 --> 00:50:32.291
Lib. you're being really quiet.
Are we still best friends?

741
00:50:39.916 --> 00:50:43.000
Excuse me. would you gentlemen
happen to know

742
00:50:43.083 --> 00:50:45.500
how to get to the Natural History Museum?

743
00:50:46.833 --> 00:50:50.583
-The dinosaurs.
-Yeah. the cute little dinos...

744
00:51:06.416 --> 00:51:09.083
Welcome to the museum.
Are you here for the bar...

745
00:51:09.166 --> 00:51:12.541
Mitzvah. Yes. I would never miss
a museum bar mitzvah.

746
00:51:13.416 --> 00:51:15.500
Terrific. Name?

747
00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:21.166
How about this? This is going to be fun.

748
00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:26.458
You read out who hasn't checked in yet.
And I'll tell you which one I am.

749
00:51:27.291 --> 00:51:29.250
Mmm.

750
00:51:30.750 --> 00:51:33.250
You look a little under-dressed
for a party.

751
00:51:38.041 --> 00:51:39.125
Ba-ba-bup.

752
00:51:40.083 --> 00:51:42.458
Shall I escort you to the exit?
Or would you...

753
00:51:45.041 --> 00:51:47.208
Hi. I was calling to know
if you guys open today...

754
00:51:47.291 --> 00:51:49.625
As I said 20 minutes ago.
we are closed...

755
00:51:49.708 --> 00:51:52.125
Who knew 13 year-olds could eat
so much in one night?

756
00:51:52.208 --> 00:51:54.791
I don't even like steak tartare
and I'm 25.

757
00:51:55.375 --> 00:51:57.625
Oh. crap! I forgot the asparagus.

758
00:51:57.708 --> 00:52:00.125
-Keep it parked. I'll go get 'em.
-Okay.

759
00:52:18.958 --> 00:52:20.583
What a night!

760
00:52:20.666 --> 00:52:23.166
You never realize how much you dislike
13 year-olds

761
00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:25.416
till you work a party for them.
huh. Heidi?

762
00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:27.791
Aw. they're not all so bad.

763
00:52:27.916 --> 00:52:32.625
I wish. I wish I were as unjaded
as my hilariously bold nephew.

764
00:52:32.708 --> 00:52:35.083
Is this the kid
you were talking about in the kitchen?

765
00:52:35.166 --> 00:52:36.916
-Yeah.
-Way you were going on about him.

766
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:41.083
-I thought he was your son.
-Ha! Yeah. I should be so lucky.

767
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:46.375
No. Okay.
I spent 15 minutes with the kid today.

768
00:52:46.458 --> 00:52:51.875
and he is around 100 times
funnier and quicker than I am.

769
00:52:52.333 --> 00:52:57.041
He's if. like. Nathan Lane
and the Tasmanian Devil had a baby.

770
00:52:58.916 --> 00:53:00.083
You gettin' off?

771
00:53:00.166 --> 00:53:03.000
Yeah. I got to get the cake
out of the kitchen.

772
00:53:18.083 --> 00:53:22.208
Um. pardon me. Hello.
I'm lost and I need to get to the kitchen.

773
00:53:22.416 --> 00:53:24.333
-Do I know you?
-Huh?

774
00:53:24.416 --> 00:53:25.708
What's your name?

775
00:53:25.791 --> 00:53:28.416
-Huh?
-I said. what's your name?

776
00:53:29.541 --> 00:53:31.625
It's just a lot of pressure. you know.

777
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:34.041
and it's like
I'm never allowed to screw up.

778
00:53:34.125 --> 00:53:36.833
I'm never allowed to lose or anything.

779
00:53:36.916 --> 00:53:40.708
It's like I'm my parents' only hope
at a future. if that makes any sense?

780
00:53:40.916 --> 00:53:44.125
-Yeah. that's cool. Should we kiss. or?

781
00:53:46.541 --> 00:53:49.041
Anthony. my stepsister
just sent me this TikTok...

782
00:53:49.125 --> 00:53:52.708
I'm kinda in the middle of something.
Don't need to see memes right now.

783
00:53:52.791 --> 00:53:55.000
Look. this is in New York.

784
00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:02.041
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home
They all say

785
00:54:02.875 --> 00:54:04.708
Oh. my gosh!

786
00:54:04.791 --> 00:54:07.416
But they're dead wrong
I know they are

787
00:54:20.833 --> 00:54:22.791
Are we cousins?

788
00:54:23.583 --> 00:54:24.750
Sure!

789
00:54:31.416 --> 00:54:35.583
Okay. kids! We're about to do
the candle-lighting ceremony.

790
00:54:37.333 --> 00:54:38.541
L'chaim?

791
00:54:45.416 --> 00:54:47.000
Well. well. well.

792
00:54:47.166 --> 00:54:50.458
Do you want to tell me why
my idiot little brother

793
00:54:50.541 --> 00:54:51.916
is in New York City.

794
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.833
going viral on TikTok?

795
00:54:54.125 --> 00:54:55.166
Well?

796
00:54:55.708 --> 00:54:59.541
Do I want to tell you.
or do I have to tell you?

797
00:54:59.708 --> 00:55:00.916
Libby.

798
00:55:07.416 --> 00:55:11.000
Why is my aunt calling you?

799
00:55:11.083 --> 00:55:14.500
She thinks I'm your mom.
It's kind of a long story.

800
00:55:19.708 --> 00:55:23.291
Get out your umbrellas. We're expecting
spring showers all day tomorrow

801
00:55:23.375 --> 00:55:24.750
in Northern West Virginia.

802
00:55:24.833 --> 00:55:29.041
Of course. It figures.
Rain on our last day of vacation.

803
00:55:30.083 --> 00:55:33.416
Anthony isn't responding to any
of my texts about the meet.

804
00:55:34.916 --> 00:55:36.958
Do you think the boys miss us?

805
00:55:37.041 --> 00:55:40.666
"Us?" Greatest parents in the world.
Come on.

806
00:55:41.958 --> 00:55:45.583
I just don't want Nate and Anthony
to grow apart like me and Heidi.

807
00:55:45.666 --> 00:55:48.750
You know. I still regret not going to
her opening night thing.

808
00:55:50.291 --> 00:55:53.208
Well. have you thought about
calling her lately. babe?

809
00:55:53.291 --> 00:55:55.041
I don't even know if she'd pick up.

810
00:55:55.583 --> 00:55:58.833
And the crazy thing is.
I'm kind of jealous of her.

811
00:55:58.916 --> 00:56:01.208
You? Come on. Really?

812
00:56:01.291 --> 00:56:03.791
She had a dream. I never had a dream.

813
00:56:03.875 --> 00:56:05.041
This isn't your dream?

814
00:56:06.375 --> 00:56:07.458
Babe.

815
00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:13.416
A kid from Pennsylvania wowed
a crowd tonight in Times Square.

816
00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:16.125
You think I should call her?

817
00:56:16.916 --> 00:56:18.541
Be the bigger person?

818
00:56:18.625 --> 00:56:19.708
Probably.

819
00:56:20.166 --> 00:56:22.750
And believe me.
you don't want to miss this kid.

820
00:56:22.833 --> 00:56:23.875
Watch this video...

821
00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:28.666
But right now.
we should celebrate our anniversary.

822
00:56:29.375 --> 00:56:31.375
Tricep.

823
00:56:35.083 --> 00:56:38.291
You made me drop the cake. okay?
That pays the rent.

824
00:56:39.416 --> 00:56:40.833
I'm not talking to you.

825
00:56:40.916 --> 00:56:42.916
Oh. okay. sorry.

826
00:56:43.166 --> 00:56:47.375
Yeah. I am putting you
on the first bus out because. you know.

827
00:56:47.458 --> 00:56:49.375
it's the right thing to do.

828
00:56:49.458 --> 00:56:50.666
That's all.

829
00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:55.750
Lilo & Stitch will still be running
in a year. okay?

830
00:56:55.833 --> 00:56:59.833
If your mom decides you can audition.
then you can audition.

831
00:57:20.375 --> 00:57:21.875
What's this?

832
00:57:21.958 --> 00:57:23.583
Your last five birthday cards.

833
00:57:25.666 --> 00:57:27.666
You remembered my birthday?

834
00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:29.375
Yeah. every year.

835
00:57:31.416 --> 00:57:33.791
I didn't know
if you'd want to hear from me.

836
00:57:34.791 --> 00:57:40.208
But. no matter what. we're family. So...

837
00:57:43.833 --> 00:57:47.250
But you yelled at me
in front of all those bar mitzvah kids.

838
00:57:47.333 --> 00:57:50.125
and made me feel like
I was back in middle school.

839
00:57:52.333 --> 00:57:57.416
I'm the only boy in seventh grade who
knows every lyric to Corner of the Sky.

840
00:57:57.875 --> 00:57:59.500
There's no justice.

841
00:58:01.291 --> 00:58:05.708
Well. "Everything has its season.
everything has its time..."

842
00:58:07.125 --> 00:58:13.041
I guarantee you are not the only boy
who knows every lyric to Pippin.

843
00:58:14.083 --> 00:58:17.083
Some just aren't comfortable yet
letting everyone know it.

844
00:58:21.041 --> 00:58:23.708
You're not going to cry. are you?

845
00:58:24.041 --> 00:58:25.541
No. no.

846
00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:31.000
I just... You know. you just...
You remind me of. like. me.

847
00:58:31.333 --> 00:58:32.458
Really?

848
00:58:32.541 --> 00:58:35.416
That's a compliment?
You think that's a compliment?

849
00:58:35.541 --> 00:58:36.583
That's amazing.

850
00:58:36.666 --> 00:58:38.208
Of course. it's a compliment.

851
00:58:38.291 --> 00:58:41.000
You're literally all I want to be
when I grow up.

852
00:58:41.083 --> 00:58:44.791
Three weeks on Broadway.
an apartment in New York.

853
00:58:44.916 --> 00:58:46.083
Queens. but...

854
00:58:46.166 --> 00:58:48.375
Queens is still New York.

855
00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:50.416
And you're still my hero.

856
00:58:56.375 --> 00:58:57.875
Aw...

857
00:59:04.583 --> 00:59:07.500
You know what?
You're going to that callback tomorrow.

858
00:59:08.125 --> 00:59:10.375
I mean. your mom knows you're here. right?

859
00:59:10.541 --> 00:59:12.458
-Are you being serious?
-Yes.

860
00:59:12.541 --> 00:59:15.833
But you have to stop shouting
'cause you have to save your voice.

861
00:59:15.916 --> 00:59:17.875
Do you have any audition tips?

862
00:59:21.333 --> 00:59:25.125
Okay. yeah. you know.
so I'm not the best singer.

863
00:59:25.291 --> 00:59:29.041
but there was this trick I used to use
for musicals. okay?

864
00:59:29.625 --> 00:59:32.875
You hold the sheet music. right?
Like. you know.

865
00:59:32.958 --> 00:59:35.250
you haven't really
fully memorized the song.

866
00:59:35.375 --> 00:59:40.333
And then halfway through. just casually.
let it drop to the floor like.

867
00:59:40.541 --> 00:59:43.500
"Wait! Not only do I know this song.

868
00:59:43.583 --> 00:59:46.250
"I'm going to blow you away
in the final verse."

869
00:59:46.958 --> 00:59:49.041
It's surprisingly effective.

870
00:59:50.083 --> 00:59:51.666
-That's amazing.
-Yeah.

871
00:59:52.541 --> 00:59:55.416
And find your light.

872
00:59:55.875 --> 00:59:58.041
Everybody forgets that.

873
00:59:58.250 --> 01:00:01.958
But how are they gonna remember you
if they can't see you?

874
01:00:03.625 --> 01:00:04.708
Yeah.

875
01:00:05.125 --> 01:00:07.625
Yeah. Find your light.

876
01:00:07.708 --> 01:00:08.833
Okay.

877
01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:17.666
I looked up to her. you know?
Your mom. I really did.

878
01:00:19.875 --> 01:00:21.583
She got the one thing

879
01:00:24.125 --> 01:00:25.541
I couldn't get.

880
01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:29.333
An amazing kid.

881
01:00:40.791 --> 01:00:41.958
I love you!

882
01:01:05.166 --> 01:01:09.166
Well. the callback was a disaster
and you blew it big time. kid.

883
01:01:09.250 --> 01:01:11.291
Back to Pittsburgh for you!

884
01:01:11.375 --> 01:01:13.083
Can I borrow some money for the bus?

885
01:01:13.166 --> 01:01:15.791
Try hitchhiking.
It'll build your character.

886
01:01:21.333 --> 01:01:22.500
Nate!

887
01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:27.458
-Nathan!
-Crap!

888
01:01:29.541 --> 01:01:32.041
- Where is he?
- Gotta pee! Gotta pee!

889
01:01:32.125 --> 01:01:33.166
Around the corner.

890
01:01:33.291 --> 01:01:34.791
How are you here right now?

891
01:01:36.583 --> 01:01:37.583
Hi. Anthony.

892
01:01:38.458 --> 01:01:40.666
Like a giant. He's like a giant.

893
01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:43.666
Hi. Aunt Heidi.
Long time no everything. I guess.

894
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:45.916
Don't "Hi. Anthony" me. Nate.

895
01:01:46.791 --> 01:01:48.625
Okay. Bye. Anthony.

896
01:01:48.708 --> 01:01:51.041
And I can live
with Heidi in New York. Perfect.

897
01:01:51.125 --> 01:01:53.250
Yeah. like Mom would ever let that happen.

898
01:01:53.333 --> 01:01:56.583
So. what. then? Are they
waiting downstairs for me with handcuffs?

899
01:01:56.666 --> 01:01:59.583
They don't even know we're here.
Get in my truck right now.

900
01:01:59.666 --> 01:02:01.833
-What? What?
-You didn't tell on me?

901
01:02:01.916 --> 01:02:04.875
No. I'm the one who's supposed to be
watching you. remember?

902
01:02:04.958 --> 01:02:06.791
Get downstairs right now!

903
01:02:07.333 --> 01:02:12.166
Okay. Please. just let me stay for two
more hours. so I can go to my callback.

904
01:02:17.166 --> 01:02:19.875
I know I embarrass you. Anthony.

905
01:02:20.458 --> 01:02:21.791
Every day.

906
01:02:22.541 --> 01:02:26.166
And I know that you hate being my brother.

907
01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:30.458
just please. let me have this one thing.

908
01:02:34.208 --> 01:02:38.208
I've been trying to explain how big
a Broadway callback is for seven hours.

909
01:02:38.291 --> 01:02:40.375
so. good luck.

910
01:02:41.083 --> 01:02:44.416
But. just for the record.
you may have run away.

911
01:02:44.541 --> 01:02:47.500
but Anthony apparently
threw quite a party.

912
01:02:47.583 --> 01:02:49.875
Which I'm sure your parents
wouldn't be happy about.

913
01:02:49.958 --> 01:02:51.708
So. you have some leverage here.

914
01:02:51.791 --> 01:02:54.500
Ooh. you're good.
You should be an agent someday.

915
01:02:54.583 --> 01:02:55.833
Want to be my agent?

916
01:02:56.791 --> 01:02:58.500
Is that a real job?

917
01:02:58.625 --> 01:03:01.250
That's the best job. okay?

918
01:03:01.333 --> 01:03:03.750
You collect ten percent
of an actor's salary

919
01:03:03.958 --> 01:03:06.791
by making phone calls
and going to three lunches a day.

920
01:03:06.875 --> 01:03:09.958
And you don't have to humiliate yourself
in an audition.

921
01:03:10.666 --> 01:03:13.583
And you get to see
what makes people amazing

922
01:03:13.666 --> 01:03:15.833
before they even know about it themselves.

923
01:03:16.750 --> 01:03:18.208
That's what an agent does. too.

924
01:03:18.291 --> 01:03:19.958
Good lord! I'm gonna wring you...

925
01:03:20.041 --> 01:03:21.166
Why are you limping?

926
01:03:21.291 --> 01:03:22.833
Quit changing the subject.

927
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.583
Let me just say
that for your little brother

928
01:03:25.666 --> 01:03:28.541
to have even gotten a callback
is kind of remarkable.

929
01:03:28.625 --> 01:03:32.416
And it says big things
about Nate's talent. Anthony.

930
01:03:32.541 --> 01:03:35.791
It just... It's two hours. two hours.

931
01:03:38.416 --> 01:03:39.958
Oh. no!

932
01:03:40.083 --> 01:03:41.333
My favorite vase.

933
01:03:41.416 --> 01:03:42.458
Nate!

934
01:03:48.458 --> 01:03:49.666
Oh. no!

935
01:03:53.666 --> 01:03:56.416
Natey! Stop!

936
01:03:58.291 --> 01:04:00.125
He's always wanted to escape out a window.

937
01:04:03.041 --> 01:04:04.916
Gosh. he is a great client.

938
01:04:14.166 --> 01:04:15.625
When I catch this punk...

939
01:04:29.375 --> 01:04:31.750
I know you not about to hop over
that turnstile.

940
01:04:31.833 --> 01:04:36.333
Thank goodness! A subway person.
I'm experiencing an emergency.

941
01:04:36.666 --> 01:04:38.916
"An emergency?" Really?

942
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:44.041
I need to get to Manhattan.
It's a matter of life. death. and dreams.

943
01:04:44.125 --> 01:04:48.625
Hold up. Wait a minute. Are you...
Yo. Keith. come here!

944
01:04:48.791 --> 01:04:50.000
Quick!

945
01:04:50.083 --> 01:04:52.791
Don't he look like that kid
that went viral on TikTok?

946
01:04:52.875 --> 01:04:54.041
I did?

947
01:04:55.166 --> 01:04:57.500
Yes! That's me! I'm the kid!

948
01:04:59.791 --> 01:05:01.625
Can I get a selfie for my niece?

949
01:05:01.708 --> 01:05:03.708
Can I get a free ride on the subway?

950
01:05:09.291 --> 01:05:10.750
Let's go! Let's go!

951
01:05:11.625 --> 01:05:13.625
Ooh. he took my trench coat.

952
01:05:15.041 --> 01:05:17.708
-Oh. Yeah. Where is my...
-Keys?

953
01:05:17.833 --> 01:05:22.666
Yeah. Okay. So. we're going to
just find him at the audition studio.

954
01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:25.041
and it's going to be okay.

955
01:05:25.125 --> 01:05:27.208
-Okay. Yeah.
-Let's go.

956
01:05:27.291 --> 01:05:30.541
When this is over. I want to know
how much you pay for this place.

957
01:05:30.625 --> 01:05:32.166
Okay. You'd be surprised.

958
01:05:34.375 --> 01:05:36.750
Excuse me.
do you know the stop for Broadway?

959
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.208
Which Broadway?
There is a lot of Broadways.

960
01:05:40.291 --> 01:05:43.291
You know. like. the Broadway.

961
01:05:43.416 --> 01:05:46.458
They say the neon lights
Are bright on Broadway

962
01:05:46.958 --> 01:05:48.375
That's the TikTok kid!

963
01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.916
As long as he's alive.
everything will be okay.

964
01:06:01.083 --> 01:06:02.625
So I can kill him.

965
01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:04.166
Over his agent's dead body.

966
01:06:04.291 --> 01:06:06.416
All right. nobody's murdering anyone!

967
01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:07.541
You started it.

968
01:06:07.625 --> 01:06:10.166
All right. be respectful.
This is an audition place.

969
01:06:39.666 --> 01:06:40.708
Okay.

970
01:06:41.250 --> 01:06:44.041
Lilo & Stitch. It was a cartoon.

971
01:06:44.875 --> 01:06:47.208
Can you just please
check the schedule again?

972
01:06:47.291 --> 01:06:48.875
There's no way he made this up.

973
01:06:48.958 --> 01:06:50.750
A hundred percent kidnapped.

974
01:06:50.833 --> 01:06:52.166
Don't... Stop saying that!

975
01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:56.083
There's no Lilo & Stitch
on the schedule today. Promise.

976
01:06:56.166 --> 01:06:58.875
You haven't seen anyone this morning
who looks like me?

977
01:06:58.958 --> 01:07:01.666
Just like. little shorter. kind of gawky?

978
01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:06.333
He's not gawky. he is incredibly castable
and very cuddly.

979
01:07:06.416 --> 01:07:08.291
No matter who he chooses to love.

980
01:07:08.416 --> 01:07:10.166
Okay. okay. Yeah.

981
01:07:10.583 --> 01:07:11.916
Anyway...

982
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.625
-Ma'am!
-I just want...

983
01:07:14.833 --> 01:07:19.333
Wait. "Ma'am?" "Ma'am?" I'm ma'am to you?
We could have gone to college together.

984
01:07:19.416 --> 01:07:21.875
-Hold on.
-My... Okay.

985
01:07:22.458 --> 01:07:25.333
You knew the callback wasn't here.
didn't you?

986
01:07:25.416 --> 01:07:27.333
-Aunt Heidi.
-What?

987
01:07:27.416 --> 01:07:29.833
He's at some place called
the Amsterdam Theatre.

988
01:07:29.916 --> 01:07:33.666
New Amsterdam. Anthony. "New."
Words matter.

989
01:07:45.625 --> 01:07:48.250
-You!
-Me. Hello.

990
01:07:49.375 --> 01:07:52.208
This is the Lilo & Stitch
final callback. right?

991
01:07:52.708 --> 01:07:53.916
I hope so.

992
01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Then why did you come dressed
as Éponine from Les Miz?

993
01:07:59.958 --> 01:08:01.416
Good luck!

994
01:08:03.958 --> 01:08:06.875
Okay. Let's cast a musical.

995
01:08:10.708 --> 01:08:12.041
Not much time.

996
01:08:12.250 --> 01:08:13.583
Right up the stairs.

997
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:15.958
Hello. twins. How are you?

998
01:08:16.208 --> 01:08:19.250
Keep it moving. Up. up. up. up.

999
01:08:19.333 --> 01:08:21.083
Thank you. Thank you.

1000
01:08:21.208 --> 01:08:23.583
Don't worry. I'm losing the coat.

1001
01:08:24.291 --> 01:08:25.416
Go!

1002
01:08:30.833 --> 01:08:32.583
Come on.

1003
01:08:33.708 --> 01:08:36.208
I feel like Elisabeth Shue in
Adventures in Babysitting

1004
01:08:36.291 --> 01:08:39.000
when the kid she's watching
gets stabbed in the foot.

1005
01:08:40.041 --> 01:08:42.958
What... Okay. I'm 100.
Hi. I'm 100 years old.

1006
01:08:43.250 --> 01:08:44.250
Heidi?

1007
01:08:45.083 --> 01:08:48.041
Oh. my gosh! Don't look at me. I'm a mess.

1008
01:08:48.125 --> 01:08:49.875
You disappeared yesterday.

1009
01:08:49.958 --> 01:08:52.416
-I hate when good people disappear.

1010
01:08:52.916 --> 01:08:55.875
A Solitary Woman is a major play. Heidi.

1011
01:08:55.958 --> 01:08:58.375
-Yeah.
-It's been a bear to cast.

1012
01:08:58.458 --> 01:09:00.500
I'm sorry. Family emergency.

1013
01:09:01.083 --> 01:09:03.250
Look. I just got a last minute no-show

1014
01:09:03.666 --> 01:09:08.166
and the director hasn't liked
anybody this week. Can I slot you in?

1015
01:09:08.250 --> 01:09:11.208
Is this an out-of-town job.
or straight to Broadway?

1016
01:09:11.291 --> 01:09:15.375
All right. that's
a really good question. actually.

1017
01:09:15.458 --> 01:09:17.583
Straight to Broadway. baby.

1018
01:09:17.666 --> 01:09:20.791
-You're doing this audition.
-Meet us at the Amsterdam Theatre!

1019
01:09:20.875 --> 01:09:25.458
Anthony. it's not a famously liberal city
in Europe. It's a Broadway theater.

1020
01:09:29.416 --> 01:09:32.250
-Okay. thanks. No. yeah.
-Thank you.

1021
01:09:33.083 --> 01:09:34.291
Okay.

1022
01:09:40.416 --> 01:09:41.416
Thank you.

1023
01:09:42.041 --> 01:09:43.250
Thank you.

1024
01:09:45.750 --> 01:09:48.916
She's not available.
We'll check on her availability.

1025
01:09:49.708 --> 01:09:51.833
Okay. whenever you're ready. Nate.

1026
01:09:52.958 --> 01:09:55.958
Okay. Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.

1027
01:10:11.375 --> 01:10:14.208
I barely had any time to memorize
these sides. so...

1028
01:10:14.291 --> 01:10:16.583
That's not important. Just do your best.

1029
01:10:16.833 --> 01:10:19.500
Start with Stitch's entrance
in the first scene.

1030
01:10:23.416 --> 01:10:25.208
"How do you plead?"

1031
01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:28.583
"Not guilty!
My experiments are only theoretical

1032
01:10:28.666 --> 01:10:31.500
"and completely within legal boundaries."

1033
01:10:31.958 --> 01:10:35.666
Nate. if you actually want to start over.
and just read Stitch's line...

1034
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:37.708
No worries. I got this!

1035
01:10:37.791 --> 01:10:41.083
"We believe you actually
created something."

1036
01:10:41.208 --> 01:10:46.666
"Created something? But that would be
irresponsible and unethical."

1037
01:10:47.083 --> 01:10:49.750
And then it says Stitch turns around
in the glass jar.

1038
01:10:57.208 --> 01:10:59.666
"What is that monstrosity?"

1039
01:11:03.083 --> 01:11:04.875
-Told you.
-"'Monstrosity'?

1040
01:11:04.958 --> 01:11:08.166
"What you see before you is
the first of a new species.

1041
01:11:08.250 --> 01:11:09.750
"I call it Experiment 626."

1042
01:11:09.833 --> 01:11:11.791
That's what you get from Pittsburgh.

1043
01:11:11.875 --> 01:11:15.708
And then Jumba sings the song
626 is Not Just a Number.

1044
01:11:17.458 --> 01:11:21.875
And which is actually getting rewritten
as we sit here. Thank you.

1045
01:11:21.958 --> 01:11:24.333
Oh. I'm sorry. Should I not have...

1046
01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:26.666
No. no. you were...

1047
01:11:28.541 --> 01:11:29.541
That was fine. Nate.

1048
01:11:32.625 --> 01:11:36.583
Oh. hi. Were you there the whole time?

1049
01:11:36.875 --> 01:11:38.083
The whole time.

1050
01:11:40.750 --> 01:11:44.291
Nate. Hi. I'm the director.

1051
01:11:44.375 --> 01:11:46.291
Have you learnt the song?

1052
01:11:46.375 --> 01:11:50.041
I mean. with the other kids. sure.

1053
01:11:50.125 --> 01:11:53.541
Listen. when you get to the part
in the duet where Lilo chimes in.

1054
01:11:53.666 --> 01:11:55.375
let that music play in the background.

1055
01:12:00.250 --> 01:12:04.541
Just sing Stitch's lyrics. I mean.
You only have to play Stitch today.

1056
01:12:06.208 --> 01:12:08.833
Oh. my gosh! I'm such an idiot!

1057
01:12:25.625 --> 01:12:27.250
Okay. what's so funny?

1058
01:12:29.916 --> 01:12:32.166
How amazing is this kid?

1059
01:12:32.250 --> 01:12:34.666
On Broadway

1060
01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:36.041
Play it. fellas!

1061
01:12:38.416 --> 01:12:39.416
Yeah.

1062
01:12:50.041 --> 01:12:53.416
On Broadway!

1063
01:12:53.958 --> 01:12:59.416
On Broadway!

1064
01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:02.541
Let's go! Let's go!

1065
01:13:07.458 --> 01:13:11.750
Okay. whenever you're ready. Nate.

1066
01:13:13.875 --> 01:13:17.833
You know you're the only kid here who
didn't show up with a parent today. right?

1067
01:13:19.416 --> 01:13:20.916
Good luck!

1068
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.208
Hello?

1069
01:13:24.375 --> 01:13:25.500
Nate?

1070
01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:40.166
Okay. Do you have any questions
before you sing?

1071
01:13:41.625 --> 01:13:42.625
Just one.

1072
01:13:44.583 --> 01:13:48.375
In the movie.
Stitch can't really speak sentences.

1073
01:13:48.666 --> 01:13:51.166
so. how does he sing lyrics
in the musical?

1074
01:13:54.208 --> 01:13:55.750
Because. you know.

1075
01:13:55.833 --> 01:13:59.333
musicals allow us to say things
we can't actually say in real life.

1076
01:14:30.333 --> 01:14:34.958
I'll admit
I don't know much about this life

1077
01:14:35.083 --> 01:14:39.916
I've spent a long time
On the outside looking in

1078
01:14:40.208 --> 01:14:45.041
Never feeling accepted
Thinking that's just the way it was

1079
01:14:46.458 --> 01:14:50.541
But something happened
Somehow life brought you to me

1080
01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:55.291
And I think that's when
I realized I belonged

1081
01:14:55.375 --> 01:15:01.083
My family's been here all along
And boy. it's good to have a friend so...

1082
01:15:02.458 --> 01:15:06.458
Maybe I don't always need to
Feel so small

1083
01:15:08.416 --> 01:15:12.916
Maybe this planet ain't so bad after all

1084
01:15:13.666 --> 01:15:15.333
From here on out...

1085
01:15:15.625 --> 01:15:18.916
Thanks. Nate. I think we're good.

1086
01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:35.000
You don't embarrass me!

1087
01:15:40.208 --> 01:15:41.333
I promise.

1088
01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:44.833
You don't embarrass me. Nate.

1089
01:16:04.708 --> 01:16:10.125
So from here on out
I'll never let you down

1090
01:16:10.208 --> 01:16:13.125
I won't be perfect all the time

1091
01:16:13.208 --> 01:16:15.875
But I'm always gonna try. yeah

1092
01:16:16.125 --> 01:16:20.208
I don't care where
I'll always be right there

1093
01:16:20.375 --> 01:16:23.250
'Cause I've got a family to call mine

1094
01:16:23.333 --> 01:16:27.833
And family means no one gets left behind

1095
01:16:30.791 --> 01:16:35.541
You bet I'll try
To bring you all the sunny days

1096
01:16:35.666 --> 01:16:39.791
And if you cry
I'll be there all the same

1097
01:16:39.875 --> 01:16:42.416
So bring the thunder. bring the rain

1098
01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:45.166
'Cause you know

1099
01:16:45.333 --> 01:16:49.416
From here on out
I'll never let you down

1100
01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:52.125
'Cause I've got a family to call mine

1101
01:16:52.541 --> 01:16:56.791
And family means no one gets left behind

1102
01:16:57.208 --> 01:16:59.250
Yeah. oh

1103
01:16:59.416 --> 01:17:02.458
Left behind. yeah

1104
01:17:02.541 --> 01:17:04.375
Oh!

1105
01:17:04.458 --> 01:17:08.166
From here on out
I'll never let you down

1106
01:17:08.625 --> 01:17:10.958
Can't claim I'll do everything right

1107
01:17:11.041 --> 01:17:12.041
Find your light.

1108
01:17:12.125 --> 01:17:13.625
But I'll love you all my life

1109
01:17:13.708 --> 01:17:18.166
Yeah. I don't care where
I'll always be right there

1110
01:17:18.250 --> 01:17:21.041
'Cause I've got a family to call mine

1111
01:17:21.291 --> 01:17:25.833
And family means no one gets left behind

1112
01:17:26.041 --> 01:17:28.083
Yeah. oh

1113
01:17:28.166 --> 01:17:30.625
Left behind

1114
01:17:31.166 --> 01:17:35.083
'Cause family means
No one gets left behind

1115
01:17:35.666 --> 01:17:36.750
Yeah

1116
01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:41.375
Left behind. yeah

1117
01:17:44.625 --> 01:17:47.625
'Cause I've got a family to call mine

1118
01:17:48.916 --> 01:17:54.000
And family means no one gets left behind

1119
01:17:57.708 --> 01:18:00.500
-You don't do that. it's inappropriate.

1120
01:18:06.250 --> 01:18:09.083
Okay. Nate.
I think that's all we're gonna need.

1121
01:18:17.958 --> 01:18:19.083
Good luck!

1122
01:18:19.166 --> 01:18:22.041
- Good job!
- He was really good!

1123
01:18:24.541 --> 01:18:25.750
Hi.

1124
01:18:31.208 --> 01:18:34.875
I didn't know you could.
like. do all that.

1125
01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.083
You don't let me sing in the house.

1126
01:18:37.416 --> 01:18:40.416
Wow. your comebacks have gotten
sharper in New York.

1127
01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:42.333
-Really?
-What? They have.

1128
01:18:42.416 --> 01:18:44.750
I dropped the sheet music
like you told me to.

1129
01:18:45.375 --> 01:18:46.583
I saw.

1130
01:18:46.708 --> 01:18:50.083
Yeah. I actually had...
I had just left my own audition.

1131
01:18:50.166 --> 01:18:51.333
and let me just say.

1132
01:18:51.416 --> 01:18:53.291
-you should be giving me tips.

1133
01:18:53.375 --> 01:18:55.416
My mom just sent me
an all-caps text saying.

1134
01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:57.458
"Why aren't you at your dad's?
I'm worried."

1135
01:18:57.541 --> 01:19:00.041
Perfect timing. I'm double parked.
Let's go.

1136
01:19:00.416 --> 01:19:02.125
Oh. Nate. Here.

1137
01:19:03.958 --> 01:19:05.375
It's a gift.

1138
01:19:05.458 --> 01:19:08.250
I picked it up on my way at some like.

1139
01:19:08.333 --> 01:19:11.291
dumb tourist trap in Times Square. So...

1140
01:19:11.375 --> 01:19:13.833
Anthony. someone's putting
a ticket on your truck.

1141
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.791
Go now. You go now.

1142
01:19:16.291 --> 01:19:17.916
My bad. officer!

1143
01:19:18.958 --> 01:19:21.541
I got you a gift. too.

1144
01:19:21.833 --> 01:19:23.291
I hope it's your size.

1145
01:19:23.875 --> 01:19:26.333
Great. Oh. I'm gonna miss this.

1146
01:19:28.541 --> 01:19:29.541
Well...

1147
01:19:31.375 --> 01:19:32.875
You should go. Natey.

1148
01:19:35.416 --> 01:19:37.416
I hope I don't see you
at Christmas this year.

1149
01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:39.000
Jeez. Nate. That was harsh.

1150
01:19:39.083 --> 01:19:42.916
Because I hope you get the part in
the play and you're too busy to come home.

1151
01:19:43.541 --> 01:19:45.916
I skipped out on that audition. sweetie.

1152
01:19:47.291 --> 01:19:52.000
I just wanted to be here with you.
And I'm so glad that I was.

1153
01:19:52.625 --> 01:19:54.125
Not to alarm anyone.

1154
01:19:54.208 --> 01:19:56.750
but your mom is on the phone
with your brother now.

1155
01:19:56.833 --> 01:19:58.500
and they are leaving the resort.

1156
01:19:58.583 --> 01:20:02.166
and Anthony said a lot of words that
I can't really say in front of an adult.

1157
01:20:02.250 --> 01:20:05.750
but I believe he'd bleeping like you
to get in the bleeping truck. now.

1158
01:20:05.833 --> 01:20:09.666
So. basically. if you two are
going to cry. cry bleeping quick.

1159
01:20:13.541 --> 01:20:15.541
Thanks for the audition tips.

1160
01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:20.916
Nate. can you just tell your mom...

1161
01:20:23.875 --> 01:20:28.333
I don't even remember why we're fighting
and I miss her.

1162
01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:32.416
Okay. Okay. I will.

1163
01:20:33.083 --> 01:20:34.291
And I'm sorry.

1164
01:20:39.916 --> 01:20:41.625
I really meant it last night.

1165
01:20:45.166 --> 01:20:46.458
You're my hero.

1166
01:20:51.291 --> 01:20:52.375
Cool.

1167
01:21:01.208 --> 01:21:04.041
-I call DJ.
-No show tunes or I drive off the highway.

1168
01:21:04.125 --> 01:21:06.916
You really have
learned nothing today. have you?

1169
01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.583
Uh. baby steps.

1170
01:21:23.125 --> 01:21:25.000
I love you.

1171
01:21:39.333 --> 01:21:41.333
Well. I'm very proud of the boys.

1172
01:21:41.833 --> 01:21:43.000
What happened?

1173
01:21:43.083 --> 01:21:46.500
Anthony said Nate couldn't come
to the phone because.

1174
01:21:46.791 --> 01:21:48.916
you're not going to believe this.

1175
01:21:49.041 --> 01:21:50.750
Nate is teaching him how to sing.

1176
01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:54.375
-That's kinda nice. Yeah?
-Yeah.

1177
01:21:54.458 --> 01:21:57.875
As long as it's not Wicked.
I can't. I really can't.

1178
01:22:00.916 --> 01:22:03.708
So if you care to find me

1179
01:22:03.916 --> 01:22:06.666
Look to the western sky!

1180
01:22:06.958 --> 01:22:09.500
As someone told me lately

1181
01:22:09.791 --> 01:22:14.000
Everyone deserves the chance to fly!

1182
01:22:24.208 --> 01:22:25.833
Thanks for making me run away.

1183
01:22:25.916 --> 01:22:27.000
Seriously.

1184
01:22:28.750 --> 01:22:32.916
It was. you know. very agent-like of you.

1185
01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:37.333
I think I found my thing.

1186
01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:49.583
-Love you like a sister!
-Love you like a sister. too!

1187
01:22:49.875 --> 01:22:51.416
Later. Libby.

1188
01:23:13.541 --> 01:23:17.083
Hey. Lib. It's been a week and no news.

1189
01:23:17.250 --> 01:23:19.958
Why aren't you in study hall?
I'm spiraling.

1190
01:23:20.916 --> 01:23:22.333
Okay. love you. bye.

1191
01:23:28.541 --> 01:23:30.208
Loser.

1192
01:23:30.291 --> 01:23:34.125
I've gotta be where my spirit can run free

1193
01:23:34.458 --> 01:23:39.083
Gotta find my corner of the sky

1194
01:23:47.041 --> 01:23:50.291
-If you tell anyone...

1195
01:23:50.458 --> 01:23:53.125
Nate Foster
to the principal's office.

1196
01:23:53.208 --> 01:23:55.750
Nate Foster to the principal's office.

1197
01:23:57.916 --> 01:23:59.666
Your secret is safe with me.

1198
01:24:08.125 --> 01:24:09.791
Nate Foster to the principal's office.

1199
01:24:09.875 --> 01:24:11.583
Whatever I did. I didn't do it.

1200
01:24:15.291 --> 01:24:16.500
What's going on?

1201
01:24:18.166 --> 01:24:22.708
Nate. did you take a trip to New York
without telling us?

1202
01:24:23.125 --> 01:24:25.583
The subway lady said
I could hop over the turnstile.

1203
01:24:25.666 --> 01:24:27.416
No. Nate. It's not that.

1204
01:24:28.416 --> 01:24:32.333
Anthony shouldn't get in trouble.
He actually kind of saved me.

1205
01:24:32.416 --> 01:24:33.541
Nate.

1206
01:24:33.833 --> 01:24:38.208
And Libby shouldn't be grounded.
If anyone should. it's me.

1207
01:24:38.875 --> 01:24:41.458
I'm not. And you're not.

1208
01:24:41.541 --> 01:24:43.541
Natey. honey. We got a call.

1209
01:24:45.250 --> 01:24:48.083
The initial offer is low but workable.

1210
01:24:51.375 --> 01:24:53.833
Wait. Wait.

1211
01:24:57.500 --> 01:24:58.666
-You mean...

1212
01:24:58.750 --> 01:25:01.208
Just getting started
We about to go up

1213
01:25:01.583 --> 01:25:03.958
Calling all boss chicks around the world

1214
01:25:04.375 --> 01:25:06.583
This is your moment
Own it. sister. woman up!

1215
01:25:07.166 --> 01:25:10.125
The world is your oyster
And we are the pearls

1216
01:25:10.208 --> 01:25:12.583
We on! We on! We on!

1217
01:25:13.125 --> 01:25:15.791
We on! We on! We on!

1218
01:25:15.875 --> 01:25:18.083
We on! We on! We on!

1219
01:25:18.208 --> 01:25:21.916
But hold up just a second
I'm about to go awf

1220
01:25:23.416 --> 01:25:24.500
Yeah!

1221
01:25:25.333 --> 01:25:27.625
Before I met Libby. I had no friends.

1222
01:25:27.708 --> 01:25:29.416
But now. I have friend.

1223
01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:32.500
And because of her.
I will be performing the role of Stitch

1224
01:25:32.625 --> 01:25:34.250
at two matinees per week.

1225
01:25:34.333 --> 01:25:36.583
and sometimes more often
if the star is sick.

1226
01:25:36.708 --> 01:25:38.833
I'm about to go awf

1227
01:25:40.458 --> 01:25:43.208
We started from the bottom
Now we're rising to the top

1228
01:25:43.416 --> 01:25:45.833
And now you've got her going
And she's never gonna stop!

1229
01:25:45.958 --> 01:25:48.708
It pays to have a beastie
That goes this hard!

1230
01:25:48.791 --> 01:25:50.708
If you want receipts
Here's my business card!

1231
01:25:50.833 --> 01:25:53.083
Dear pearls

1232
01:25:53.166 --> 01:25:55.500
Get out of your shells
It's your world

1233
01:25:55.583 --> 01:26:00.000
We've got to cheer each other on!

1234
01:26:00.083 --> 01:26:02.458
Until Queendom come!

1235
01:26:03.375 --> 01:26:06.083
We on! We on! We on!

1236
01:26:06.208 --> 01:26:08.583
We on! We on! We on!

1237
01:26:08.916 --> 01:26:10.833
We on! We on! We on!

1238
01:26:11.083 --> 01:26:13.833
But hold up just a second
I'm about to go awf...

1239
01:26:13.916 --> 01:26:16.000
Before Nate came back into my life.

1240
01:26:16.083 --> 01:26:20.333
I was a cater waiter with
a rent-controlled apartment. but now...

1241
01:26:21.541 --> 01:26:23.791
I'm A Solitary Woman.

1242
01:26:24.041 --> 01:26:25.750
with a rent-controlled apartment.

1243
01:26:25.833 --> 01:26:30.000
And an amazing family. And agent.

1244
01:26:30.750 --> 01:26:33.416
Just getting started
We about to go up

1245
01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:36.500
Calling all boss chicks around the world

1246
01:26:36.583 --> 01:26:38.791
This is your moment
Own it. sister. woman up!

1247
01:26:38.875 --> 01:26:42.125
The world is your oyster
And we are the pearls

1248
01:26:42.208 --> 01:26:45.041
We on! We on! We on!

1249
01:26:45.125 --> 01:26:47.833
We on! We on! We on!

1250
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
We on! We on! We on!

1251
01:26:50.125 --> 01:26:54.000
But hold up just a second
I'm about to go awf

1252
01:26:55.291 --> 01:26:56.333
Yep!

1253
01:26:57.416 --> 01:26:59.916
I'm about to go awf

1254
01:27:00.041 --> 01:27:01.791
-Yep!

1255
01:27:03.583 --> 01:27:06.291
For the longest time.
I always thought of Libby

1256
01:27:06.416 --> 01:27:10.250
as my little brother's
loud. intelligent friend.

1257
01:27:10.333 --> 01:27:14.166
But now. I pledge that
if I ever decide to go pro one day.

1258
01:27:14.250 --> 01:27:17.458
I will hire Libby as my sports agent.

1259
01:27:18.166 --> 01:27:19.166
Is that good?

1260
01:27:19.250 --> 01:27:22.708
Let's just say there's a reason
Nate's the actor of the family.

1261
01:27:22.833 --> 01:27:24.166
Could I try another take?

1262
01:27:24.375 --> 01:27:26.208
Hold on. you need lip gloss.

1263
01:27:26.416 --> 01:27:27.916
-I'm a star maker
-Yeah

1264
01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.250
A mover and shaker

1265
01:27:29.333 --> 01:27:31.791
-Only thirteen
-But bringing home the vegan bacon

1266
01:27:31.875 --> 01:27:34.791
The hustle's a la carte.
And I don't sell dreams

1267
01:27:34.875 --> 01:27:37.416
But if I'm representing.
It'll be a small fee

1268
01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:39.083
Dear pearls

1269
01:27:39.208 --> 01:27:41.541
Get out of your shells
It's your world

1270
01:27:41.625 --> 01:27:43.333
We've got to cheer each other on!

1271
01:27:43.416 --> 01:27:44.458
I love you!

1272
01:27:46.458 --> 01:27:48.416
Until Queendom come!

1273
01:27:49.125 --> 01:27:51.375
Just getting started
We about to go up

1274
01:27:51.791 --> 01:27:53.416
That's my brother!

1275
01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:57.083
Just getting started
We about to go up

1276
01:27:57.291 --> 01:28:00.000
Just getting started
We about to go up!

1277
01:28:00.541 --> 01:28:03.125
We on! We on! We on!

1278
01:28:03.250 --> 01:28:05.416
We on! We on! We on!

1279
01:28:06.125 --> 01:28:08.250
We on! We on! We on!

1280
01:28:08.333 --> 01:28:11.583
But hold up just a second
I'm about to go awf

1281
01:28:11.791 --> 01:28:13.833
I put me on
I put me on

1282
01:28:13.916 --> 01:28:17.375
I put me. put me. put me. put me
I'm about to go awf

1283
01:28:17.458 --> 01:28:19.500
I put me on
I put me on

1284
01:28:19.583 --> 01:28:22.333
I put me. I put me. I put me. I put me
I'm about to go

1285
01:28:22.416 --> 01:28:25.208
Just getting started
We about to go up

1286
01:28:25.291 --> 01:28:28.000
Calling all boss chicks around the world

1287
01:28:28.083 --> 01:28:30.583
This is your moment
Own it. sister. woman up!

1288
01:28:30.666 --> 01:28:33.875
The world is your oyster
And we are the pearls
