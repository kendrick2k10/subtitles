3
00:04:26.792 --> 00:04:27.626
Yes.

4
00:04:28.292 --> 00:04:29.709
How are you?

5
00:04:30.209 --> 00:04:32.167
- Good.
- It's been a while.

6
00:04:32.292 --> 00:04:34.959
Your grandmother? Better?

7
00:04:35.667 --> 00:04:37.167
Worse.

8
00:04:37.251 --> 00:04:39.251
She is lucky to have you.

9
00:04:39.417 --> 00:04:43.001
Your father would have been proud
that you are taking care other.

10
00:04:43.084 --> 00:04:44.709
Look…

11
00:04:45.376 --> 00:04:48.584
I wanted to ask you.
what time will you be home tomorrow?

12
00:04:48.876 --> 00:04:50.834
In the afternoon. after work. Why?

13
00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:52.876
I have sent you something small.

14
00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:54.751
It's different from the others.

15
00:04:54.834 --> 00:04:56.834
We'll talk tomorrow. Good night.

16
00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:58.959
Good night.

17
00:05:45.084 --> 00:05:48.501
100. 200. 300. 400. 20…

18
00:05:53.667 --> 00:05:56.084
And two euros.

19
00:05:56.334 --> 00:05:57.459
This is the last of it.

20
00:05:57.626 --> 00:06:00.042
I'll get in touch with you
if I need you again.

21
00:07:24.251 --> 00:07:26.459
I didn't want to send
a German language book this time

22
00:07:26.542 --> 00:07:28.626
but something to get familiar
with the area here.

23
00:07:28.709 --> 00:07:30.834
I've written our address
on the first page.

24
00:07:30.917 --> 00:07:33.917
She left us this morning.

25
00:07:38.459 --> 00:07:40.626
Will you come?

26
00:07:40.709 --> 00:07:42.751
I would have come for sure…

27
00:07:42.834 --> 00:07:45.626
But I am alone with Patrick these days.
It's difficult for me to leave.

28
00:07:45.709 --> 00:07:48.959
I can't leave him with Helga.
I don't trust her.

29
00:07:49.042 --> 00:07:52.292
It's also his birthday this Sunday
and I have to organise a party.

30
00:07:52.834 --> 00:07:54.834
I wish I could be there.

31
00:08:13.792 --> 00:08:15.709
We offer a very economical package.

32
00:08:15.834 --> 00:08:18.209
1050 euros for the entire ceremony.

33
00:08:18.292 --> 00:08:20.709
We provide the hearse

34
00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:24.251
and two people to transport the coffin.

35
00:08:24.417 --> 00:08:26.251
We need two more.

36
00:08:26.334 --> 00:08:28.376
One more person besides you.

37
00:08:28.501 --> 00:08:32.001
The price doesn't include
the workers who dig the grave.

38
00:08:32.584 --> 00:08:36.251
With the digging of the grave.
the price will be 1200 euros.

39
00:08:37.376 --> 00:08:40.709
Shall I presume that
a family grave already exists?

40
00:08:41.667 --> 00:08:45.501
Then we have coffee. rusk and brandy.
Two euros per person.

41
00:08:45.792 --> 00:08:49.459
If we expect around fifty people.

42
00:08:50.042 --> 00:08:52.792
then the price will be at 1500 euros.

43
00:08:52.917 --> 00:08:56.001
Unless the deceased was popular.

44
00:08:58.126 --> 00:09:00.417
Was she popular?

45
00:10:19.709 --> 00:10:24.167
CASH FOR GOLD

46
00:10:29.167 --> 00:10:32.334
PAWN SHOP

47
00:11:59.292 --> 00:12:01.334
Lesson one.

48
00:12:01.417 --> 00:12:03.501
I live in Munich.

49
00:12:03.751 --> 00:12:05.751
Bavaria is wonderful.

50
00:12:05.834 --> 00:12:07.501
Lesson one.

51
00:12:07.584 --> 00:12:09.709
I live in Munich.

52
00:13:27.126 --> 00:13:30.334
Excuse me! You cannot sleep here.

53
00:20:28.292 --> 00:20:31.126
My name is Ursula.
Ursula Handtmann.

54
00:20:31.709 --> 00:20:34.376
I'm twenty-six years old.

55
00:20:34.667 --> 00:20:39.667
Hello. my name is Ursula.
Ursula Handtmann.

56
00:20:41.501 --> 00:20:44.167

I live in Munich. Bavaria is…

58
00:20:53.834 --> 00:20:58.501
Are you hungry?

59
00:21:01.251 --> 00:21:03.376
You have money?

60
00:21:47.084 --> 00:21:48.876
You're a fast-food kid.

61
00:22:01.459 --> 00:22:03.501
Number 12 for me.

62
00:22:05.042 --> 00:22:09.167
And 54 for my friend.

63
00:22:11.501 --> 00:22:12.501
Thank you.

64
00:22:20.209 --> 00:22:21.084
Sorry.

65
00:22:21.501 --> 00:22:24.334
And a saucer with pickles. please.

66
00:22:24.459 --> 00:22:25.792
Of course.

67
00:33:39.334 --> 00:33:41.042
Fuck you. asshole!

68
00:33:41.292 --> 00:33:43.501
Stronzo in your face. asshole.

69
00:34:35.792 --> 00:34:37.876
- Hello.

70
00:34:37.959 --> 00:34:41.126

over the limit?

71
00:34:42.792 --> 00:34:45.001
Licence and registration. please.

72
00:34:51.417 --> 00:34:52.417
Calm down.

73
00:34:57.251 --> 00:34:59.001
Who is Angeliki?

74
00:34:59.459 --> 00:35:00.334
Who?

75
00:35:04.792 --> 00:35:06.917
It's none of your business.

76
00:35:07.001 --> 00:35:08.792
Have you been drinking?

77
00:35:08.917 --> 00:35:09.751
Yes.

78
00:35:10.917 --> 00:35:12.667
Are you going to take our order. then?

79
00:35:12.792 --> 00:35:15.084
Get out of the car.

80
00:35:15.292 --> 00:35:17.667
Get out! Exit the car.

81
00:35:18.001 --> 00:35:19.626
Let's go.

82
00:35:22.667 --> 00:35:23.626
Come on.

83
00:38:25.626 --> 00:38:27.459
Tommaso. hi.

00:38:27.667 --> 00:38:28.751
Mathias.

85
00:38:30.667 --> 00:38:32.501
Hi. You came!

86
00:38:33.167 --> 00:38:34.917
I brought a friend. OK?

87
00:38:35.584 --> 00:38:38.917
Tommaso this is Victoras.
Victoras. this is Tommaso.

88
00:38:40.542 --> 00:38:42.626
Strong handshake.

89
00:38:42.792 --> 00:38:44.334
Are you German?

90
00:38:45.751 --> 00:38:46.917
English?

91
00:38:47.751 --> 00:38:49.167
French?

92
00:38:49.626 --> 00:38:50.959
Bulgarian?

93
00:38:51.334 --> 00:38:53.167
Ask him if he's Greek.

94
00:38:53.334 --> 00:38:54.709
Greek?

95
00:38:55.167 --> 00:38:56.001
Yes.

96
00:38:56.209 --> 00:38:58.042
But of course!

97
00:42:55.001 --> 00:42:57.542
Here I am. Turn right.

98
00:43:12.251 --> 00:43:13.417
Bye. beautiful.

99
00:43:17.876 --> 00:43:19.667
Thanks a lot.

100
00:43:31.792 --> 00:43:33.792
You've forgotten something!

101
00:51:37.626 --> 00:51:39.792
Are you tired?

102
01:01:28.584 --> 01:01:29.834
Hello.

103
01:01:32.834 --> 01:01:34.667
Have you…

104
01:05:02.334 --> 01:05:04.459
No. No. No…

105
01:05:04.667 --> 01:05:07.834
Come in. come in.

106
01:06:06.626 --> 01:06:09.667
I'm sorry. That's my son.

107
01:06:11.126 --> 01:06:14.126
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

108
01:06:16.542 --> 01:06:17.917
You are here!

109
01:06:18.584 --> 01:06:20.126
I came with a friend.

110
01:06:20.834 --> 01:06:23.376
Mathias. Angeliki. Angeliki. Mathias.

111
01:06:23.959 --> 01:06:25.334
Nice to meet you.

112
01:06:25.501 --> 01:06:27.042
You already made a friend here?

113
01:06:27.334 --> 01:06:29.126
We came together from Greece.

114
01:06:29.417 --> 01:06:31.584
You came from Greece together?

115
01:06:31.667 --> 01:06:33.459
Yes. We came with your car.

116
01:06:33.542 --> 01:06:35.417
- Which car?
- The Audi.

117
01:06:35.542 --> 01:06:37.251
That piece of crap is still working?

118
01:06:37.334 --> 01:06:40.001
But don't worry
your son is an amazing driver.

119
01:06:40.917 --> 01:06:43.126
He only got us arrested once.

120
01:06:46.292 --> 01:06:47.876
Your friend is funny.

121
01:06:47.959 --> 01:06:49.334
He doesn't speak German.

122
01:06:49.459 --> 01:06:51.376
So much for all the books I've sent.

123
01:06:53.626 --> 01:06:55.334
Are you hungry?

124
01:06:55.501 --> 01:06:57.542
Should Helga make you a plate?

125
01:07:03.917 --> 01:07:06.001
Can you bring two plates please?

126
01:07:08.834 --> 01:07:10.417
This is Victoras…

127
01:07:11.167 --> 01:07:12.167
My son.

128
01:07:14.667 --> 01:07:16.917
- And…
- Mathias.

129
01:07:21.459 --> 01:07:22.959
Did you meet this handsome fellow?

130
01:07:23.709 --> 01:07:25.459
This is our Bjarke!

131
01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:28.334
Amazing breed.

132
01:07:28.917 --> 01:07:30.626
Obedient.

133
01:07:30.751 --> 01:07:32.667
And very expensive!

134
01:07:35.501 --> 01:07:37.167
Patrick… Where is Patrick?

135
01:07:37.501 --> 01:07:39.834
You have to see you brother.
You won't recognise him!

136
01:07:40.751 --> 01:07:43.709
If I'd known you were coming.
we would have celebrated differently.

137
01:07:43.917 --> 01:07:46.042
Where is my cake?

138
01:07:47.501 --> 01:07:49.459
Look how much your brother grew up.

139
01:07:49.542 --> 01:07:51.417
Patrick. you remember Victoras?

140
01:07:51.501 --> 01:07:54.209
- No!
- You met him in Greece.

141
01:07:54.917 --> 01:07:56.084
How could he remember you?

142
01:07:57.042 --> 01:07:59.792
Helga. let's get the sweets now!

143
01:08:00.126 --> 01:08:01.501
For the kids!

144
01:08:03.917 --> 01:08:05.917
Be careful. Patrick!

145
01:08:06.334 --> 01:08:08.126
Come outside and meet the others.

146
01:08:08.459 --> 01:08:09.876
Too bad Sasha is not here!

147
01:09:51.251 --> 01:09:53.292
Victoras. what are you doing?

148
01:10:01.292 --> 01:10:03.459
Stop. Quiet!

149
01:10:40.334 --> 01:10:41.959
Life is very different here.

150
01:10:43.876 --> 01:10:45.542
You get used to it over time

151
01:10:51.001 --> 01:10:52.501
I'm more responsible now.

152
01:10:53.376 --> 01:10:54.959
You can count on me.

153
01:10:56.209 --> 01:10:57.667
You drove us here drunk.

154
01:10:58.167 --> 01:10:59.376
You hit my dog.

155
01:11:07.542 --> 01:11:08.584
I wanted…

156
01:11:13.959 --> 01:11:15.292
It's not like this every day.

157
01:11:16.251 --> 01:11:18.959
We have our good and our bad days.

158
01:11:19.876 --> 01:11:21.792
Sasha is often away for work.

159
01:11:22.292 --> 01:11:23.834
And I've had enough of being alone.

160
01:11:25.042 --> 01:11:26.376
You have Helga.

161
01:11:27.667 --> 01:11:28.792
And Patrick.

162
01:11:30.084 --> 01:11:31.167
And Bjorke.

163
01:11:31.501 --> 01:11:32.667
Bjarke!

164
01:11:42.709 --> 01:11:45.084
I took Patrick to try diving.

165
01:11:45.626 --> 01:11:47.292
He didn't like it at all.

166
01:11:47.501 --> 01:11:48.959
He was afraid.

167
01:11:49.042 --> 01:11:51.376
He didn't jump.
Not even from one metre!

168
01:11:51.459 --> 01:11:54.167
You. when you were little

169
01:11:54.417 --> 01:11:56.417
you always told me your dream was to fly.

170
01:11:56.584 --> 01:11:57.834
You remember?

171
01:11:58.126 --> 01:11:59.792
This was your dream.

172
01:12:00.042 --> 01:12:01.459
I remember it well.

173
01:12:01.626 --> 01:12:03.917
Your grandmother always said
you should become a pilot.

174
01:12:04.042 --> 01:12:06.834
I said you should take diving lessons.

175
01:12:08.126 --> 01:12:10.292
I wanted to make your dream come true.

176
01:12:10.501 --> 01:12:14.334
You took me diving because I was restless
and I was getting on your nerves.

177
01:12:16.209 --> 01:12:18.042
I don't remember that.

178
01:12:19.084 --> 01:12:22.084
But if that was the case.
something good came out of it.

179
01:12:25.792 --> 01:12:27.667
Give me a drag.

180
01:12:41.751 --> 01:12:43.959
Do you want to drive?

181
01:13:33.292 --> 01:13:35.709
Will you help me take him inside?

182
01:14:00.126 --> 01:14:01.876
You must be starving after all this.

183
01:14:04.167 --> 01:14:05.542
Don't be silly.

184
01:14:05.751 --> 01:14:08.001
You are part of the family!
