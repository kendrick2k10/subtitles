3
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.243
A wise man once said.

4
00:00:36.243 --> 00:00:38.310
that in order for a man
to know where he's going

5
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.160
he must first know where he has been.

6
00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:43.250
There are no heroes in this story.

7
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.810
Just the monsters I helped create.

8
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.010
I used to be a good man.

9
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.470
But today I'm here to right my wrong.

10
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.633
And to do that. I'll have to
go back to where it all began.

11
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.543
- At 7:34 P.M. Hilo
police responded to a call

12
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.960
in regards to an unarmed black man.

13
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.770
Witnesses say he reached for his wallet

14
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.833
as police approached.

15
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.403
That is when the two officers
involved opened fire.

16
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.850
Striking the suspect once in the torso

17
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.380
and multiple times in the neck.

18
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.730
The victim was rushed to
Hilo Memorial Hospital

19
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.490
where he was pronounced dead.

20
00:01:32.526 --> 00:01:33.559
- Mayor Richards?

21
00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:34.392
- Yes.

22
00:01:34.392 --> 00:01:35.225
- What is your response

23
00:01:35.225 --> 00:01:36.920
to the recent uproar across the city?

24
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.360
Especially within the
African American community

25
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.380
in regards to the spike in
these types of shootings

26
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.420
of unarmed black men across the city.

27
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.840
What measures are you
implementing to ensure

28
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.450
accountability when police officers

29
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.313
fire their weapons unjustly. Mr. Mayor?

30
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.440
- I understand that there is a lot of pain

31
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.203
and anger right now in our city.

32
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.960
I understand that.

33
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.746
Our entire city understands that.

34
00:02:04.746 --> 00:02:07.580
But what we've witnessed
in the past several hours

35
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.580
and throughout our city. I
cannot. we cannot tolerate it.

36
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.263
Those two officers involved
have been suspended.

37
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.200
We're currently working
with the Inspector General

38
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.880
and the Governor's office.

39
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.350
And this is currently
an active investigation.

40
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.490
- Right. but as you're
aware people are protesting.

41
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.530
Violence is on the rise and the city

42
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.400
is burning down to the ground.

43
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.540
With that said. Mr. Mayor.
when will justice be served?

44
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.080
Will justice be served?

45
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.520
The city has spoken and it is clear

46
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.253
that they are tired. Mr. Mayor.

47
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.450
- How long are you
reporters gonna keep trying

48
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.950
to divide my office and
the people of this city?

49
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.374
We're all on the same side.

50
00:02:55.374 --> 00:02:58.143
Now as far as injustice. it ends now.

51
00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.370
Effective immediately any
unjustified police shootings

52
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.470
will hereby be subject to imprisonment.

53
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.050
Pending investigation.

54
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.513
We will no longer tolerate the unruly.

55
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.420
lawless actions of the men
and women sworn to protect us.

56
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.020
Thank you. no more questions.

57
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.620
- Just wait a minute. Mr. Mayor.

58
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:19.773
Mr. Mayor.

59
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.054
- Where the fuck you been?

60
00:03:48.054 --> 00:03:49.780
- You dare question me.

61
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.663
Where's Chubbs?

62
00:03:51.683 --> 00:03:54.300
- You're just gonna come
in here and call no shots.

63
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.032
- Yeah. actually I am.

64
00:03:56.032 --> 00:03:57.050
Do you have a problem with that?

65
00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.350
- You're not in charge
around here. Chubbs is.

66
00:04:00.193 --> 00:04:01.026
Hey yo. Chubbs!

67
00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.343
Bitch ass cop.

68
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.760
- Do you feel in charge now!

69
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.150
- Hey yo. that's enough. man.

70
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.520
- Do these assholes speak for you?

71
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.370
- These assholes you keep talking about.

72
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.203
this is my crew.

73
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.713
Last time I checked. I
agreed to work with you.

74
00:04:26.777 --> 00:04:27.777
Not for you.

75
00:04:28.995 --> 00:04:31.875
You need to remember that shit.

76
00:04:31.875 --> 00:04:36.208
And if I was you. I'd put
that gun down in my house.

77
00:04:48.435 --> 00:04:51.820
- The way I see it. I'm the
brains of this operation.

78
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:52.820
And I have the pull.

79
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.360
So I think you need to remember

80
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.503
that without me. you don't make any money.

81
00:04:58.471 --> 00:04:59.850
- What the fuck you want. man?

82
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.233
- We have a job.

83
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.323
You and your crew. get ready.

84
00:05:06.478 --> 00:05:07.628
We leave in 10 minutes.

85
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.453
Oh and Chubbs. don't keep me waiting.

86
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.010
- You heard the man. Ravage.

87
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.893
Ganther. let's go.

88
00:06:01.196 --> 00:06:02.410
- Yo. I've got a funny
feeling about this. man.

89
00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.000
You trust this dude?

90
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.160
Word on the street is
this kid is ruthless. man.

91
00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.993
- Listen. listen man.

92
00:06:06.993 --> 00:06:08.410
He come highly recommended.

93
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:09.860
Fuck the word on the streets.

94
00:06:11.334 --> 00:06:12.212
- All right. whatever. man.

95
00:06:12.212 --> 00:06:13.710
- Yeah. but you think
they're gonna show up?

96
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.860
- Yo listen. y'all nervous man.

97
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:16.950
We got this. man.

98
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.189
- Yeah. but they were
supposed to be here by 7:00.

99
00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:29.996
I hope this shit ain't a fucking setup.

100
00:06:29.996 --> 00:06:32.663
- That's them right there. yeah?

101
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.921
- Gentlemen. where's my money?

102
00:06:40.921 --> 00:06:43.189
- What time is it?

103
00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:44.310
- Late.

104
00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.610
- We got your money. but you're late.

105
00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.060
I got a thing about being kept waiting.

106
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.155
- Yeah well. we had a minor mishap.

107
00:06:53.155 --> 00:06:54.866
- A mishap?

108
00:06:54.866 --> 00:06:55.699
Whatever.

109
00:06:57.218 --> 00:06:58.801
Give 'em the money.

110
00:07:01.433 --> 00:07:02.683
- This the 60K?

111
00:07:03.598 --> 00:07:05.348
Is that what we said?

112
00:07:06.277 --> 00:07:07.694
- 60K. all there.

113
00:07:12.157 --> 00:07:13.980
- Get these men their product.

114
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:14.813
- No problem.

115
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.370
- Let's smoke these fools. B.

116
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:19.483
- Clowns with guns.

117
00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.440
So you think you just
gonna roll up in here

118
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.630
and rob us and leave?

119
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:27.020
You think that's how it's going down?

120
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.020
- Pretty much. yeah.

121
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.100
- So how we gonna handle this?

122
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.223
- Well. we don't need this
to get extra messy. do we?

123
00:07:36.394 --> 00:07:37.790
- What the fuck is that?

124
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.472
- A little insurance policy.

125
00:07:39.472 --> 00:07:41.155
- Lower the guns. lower the guns.

126
00:07:41.155 --> 00:07:42.452
- Fuck that.

127
00:07:42.452 --> 00:07:44.420
- Put the guns down. put the guns down.

128
00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.570
- Wise move. gentlemen.

129
00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.023
- You know this ain't over. right?

130
00:07:48.023 --> 00:07:50.053
- Pleasure doing business with you.

131
00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:51.053
- Fuck that.

132
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.146
I can't believe this shit.

133
00:07:56.146 --> 00:07:56.979
Fucking clowns.

134
00:07:56.979 --> 00:07:57.933
- 60K. boys.

135
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.657
- Fuckin guys are trippin.

136
00:08:06.775 --> 00:08:09.730
- Dude. Sergeant Lawrence
is such a fucking asshole.

137
00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:12.047
- Yeah. I never liked that guy. man.

138
00:08:12.047 --> 00:08:13.210
The 4012 Sergeant is way better

139
00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:14.060
from what I hear.

140
00:08:16.901 --> 00:08:19.058
- You're not thinking about
switching over. are you?

141
00:08:19.058 --> 00:08:22.460
- Mm. Nah. I don't think so.

142
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.580
Besides. we have RNP 407 today.

143
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.589
And we're patrolling the
good old southern district.

144
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:28.712
So you know how that goes.

145
00:08:28.712 --> 00:08:30.037
- This should be interesting.

146
00:08:30.037 --> 00:08:31.037
- Always is.

147
00:08:32.024 --> 00:08:35.440
So. I wanted to run something by you.

148
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.273
- I'm listening.

149
00:08:38.877 --> 00:08:41.343
- So. there's this guy
in the southern district.

150
00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:44.990
He's kind of a well known dealer.

151
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:46.990
And from what I hear. he's got a lot

152
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:49.123
of city cops on the payroll.

153
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.720
And guys are making big payouts.

154
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.430
All you gotta do is
just give him a heads up

155
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.153
whenever something's about to go down.

156
00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.280
- You're serious?

157
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.203
- We make what?

158
00:09:00.203 --> 00:09:01.503
A lousy 40K a year.

159
00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:05.088
I got two kids and a
mortgage to pay for. man.

160
00:09:05.088 --> 00:09:06.443
You think that salary's cutting it?

161
00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:09.977
Besides. we have the badge.

162
00:09:09.977 --> 00:09:11.990
And the power. for Christ's sake.

163
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:13.030
- So let me get this straight.

164
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.130
I want to make sure I'm
hearing you correctly.

165
00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:16.960
You're asking me to go against

166
00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.160
everything we stand for as cops and betray

167
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.853
the very same oath we took?

168
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.510
- Listen. I'm asking you as my partner

169
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:29.170
and more importantly as my brother

170
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.860
to just consider this opportunity.

171
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.188
And just do this for
me just one time. man.

172
00:09:34.188 --> 00:09:35.633
That's all I'm asking for. just one time.

173
00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:45.623
- I'll be waiting for
you in the patrol car.

174
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.871
- Hey Susan. it's Detective Sean Jones

175
00:10:05.871 --> 00:10:08.480
from the Hilo Police
Department investigation unit.

176
00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.030
Listen. I have some very
important information

177
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.900
I need to get over to Russ. ASAP.

178
00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.380
- Yo. Pedreddi.
- Yo.

179
00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.590
- Last night. dude. I
was fucking this girl.

180
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:18.620
- Yeah man. did she have big tits?

181
00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.300
- Dude. she was fucking hot. nice tits.

182
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.133
- Yeah. boy.

183
00:10:21.133 --> 00:10:22.260
- But seriously. what's

184
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.230

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:25.640

00:10:29.046 --> 00:10:30.400
I'm fucking ready to kick ass already

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.970

191
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:32.803

00:10:32.803 --> 00:10:33.790

All this waiting. bro.

194
00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:38.400
- Who the fuck is this guy?

195
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.233
- Let's get him.

196
00:10:39.233 --> 00:10:40.066
- Yeah. hold on.

197
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:42.283
Hey man.

198
00:10:42.283 --> 00:10:43.203
Hey. hold up!

199
00:10:44.173 --> 00:10:45.627
What you doing in this neighborhood?

200
00:10:45.627 --> 00:10:46.491
- Just got out of work.

201
00:10:46.491 --> 00:10:47.324
I'm just trying to go home.

202
00:10:47.324 --> 00:10:48.157
- You live around here?

203
00:10:48.157 --> 00:10:49.239
- No. I don't live around here.

204
00:10:49.239 --> 00:10:50.072
I just got outta work.

205
00:10:50.072 --> 00:10:50.905
- You got ID on you?

206
00:10:50.905 --> 00:10:51.992
- What's with the attitude?
- Hey come here.

207
00:10:51.992 --> 00:10:52.825
- Why are you touching me?

208
00:10:52.825 --> 00:10:53.658
Why are you touching me?

209
00:10:53.658 --> 00:10:54.844
- I wanna talk to you for a minute.

210
00:10:54.844 --> 00:10:55.677
- I just got out of work.

211
00:10:55.677 --> 00:10:56.510
- We just want to talk to you.

212
00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:57.343
- What did I do?

213
00:10:57.343 --> 00:10:58.273
- Just come stand over here for me.

214
00:10:58.273 --> 00:10:59.106
- What did I do?
- Just come stand right here.

215
00:10:59.106 --> 00:10:59.939
- Do you have ID on you?

216
00:10:59.939 --> 00:11:01.083
- Do you have ID or not?

217
00:11:01.083 --> 00:11:02.050
- This is fucking bullshit.

218
00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:04.940
- Okay. well folder me
Sergeant Guzman's information.

219
00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.780
Matter of fact. I know
exactly how to get it to him.

220
00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:08.840
- Yo fella. come on!

221
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.243
- Give me your fucking hands.

222
00:11:10.243 --> 00:11:11.120
- Come on. come on.
- I'm not resisting.

223
00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.475
- I'm gonna have to call you back.

224
00:11:12.475 --> 00:11:13.422
- I'm not resisting!

225
00:11:13.422 --> 00:11:14.740
- Stop resisting.
- I'm fucking cuffed!

226
00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.710
- Calm down. everybody shut the fuck up.

227
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:18.390
Calm down.

228
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:19.893
- No. I gotta stop this.

229
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:22.670
- Pick him up.

230
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:23.503
- Come on.

231
00:11:23.503 --> 00:11:25.210
- This is bullshit. man.

232
00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:26.710
- Relax. what's going on here?

233
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:29.598
- Miss. I need you to
stop right there. miss.

234
00:11:29.598 --> 00:11:30.431
- No. no. no!

235
00:11:30.431 --> 00:11:31.264
- I need you to stop now. stop.

236
00:11:31.264 --> 00:11:32.334
- I just got outta work.

237
00:11:32.334 --> 00:11:35.110
All I was trying to do was
pick up some food for my son

238
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:37.140
when these two officers profiled me.

239
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.530
asked me for my ID.

240
00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:39.363
When I reached in my pocket

241
00:11:39.363 --> 00:11:41.190
to show my ID. they rushed me.

242
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:42.450
- Did you see what happened?

243
00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.690
- Miss. we have the situation
under control. please.

244
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:46.679
- Are you just gonna stand
there and do nothing?

245
00:11:46.679 --> 00:11:47.512
- That's not what happened.

246
00:11:47.512 --> 00:11:49.140
He was resisting.
- Bullshit!

247
00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.833
- Relax. where's the ID?

248
00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:00.537
- Bullshit. I thought he
was gonna reach for a--

249
00:12:00.537 --> 00:12:02.023
- For a fucking what? A gun?

250
00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:04.110
I forgot he's black.

251
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:05.780
He's supposed to have a gun. right?

252
00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.190
If this was a white person.
would it be the same?

253
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:09.023
- Hell fucking no.

254
00:12:09.023 --> 00:12:10.330
- Come on. you can't be serious.

255
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:11.977
- Yeah. what are you trying to say. Jones?

256
00:12:11.977 --> 00:12:13.603
- Just answer the fucking question.

257
00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:16.003
Matter of fact. uncuff him.

258
00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:19.093
- This is bullshit.

259
00:12:23.012 --> 00:12:24.410
Ah!

260
00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:25.520
- Take it easy.

261
00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.217
Come here. come here. come here.

262
00:12:27.217 --> 00:12:28.974
Stand there.

263
00:12:28.974 --> 00:12:30.307
Listen. brother.

264
00:12:31.235 --> 00:12:33.164
I'm sorry about that. all right.

265
00:12:33.164 --> 00:12:35.238
Don't. don't get upset.

266
00:12:35.238 --> 00:12:38.080
This shouldn't have happened. all right?

267
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.080
- Thank you.

268
00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:43.690
We need more cops like you out here.

269
00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:45.440
- Get home safe. man.

270
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.973
Let me tell you guys something.

271
00:12:47.973 --> 00:12:50.010
I'm going to IA and I'm gonna order

272
00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:53.163
a full investigation on you
guy's conduct. all right?

273
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.960
Now get the fuck outta here.

274
00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.610
Go tell your sergeant to call me.

275
00:13:06.419 --> 00:13:08.919
Shit ain't never gonna change.

276
00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.040
- Detective La Salle.
can you tell me about

277
00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.923
the events that transpired
on Thursday. September 12th?

278
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:20.350
- At approximately 1800 hours myself.

279
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:23.490
officer George. and
officer Studwell received

280
00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:26.880
a radio call regarding
an unusual disturbance.

281
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.120
A female caucasian walking a dog indicated

282
00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.000
she observed an unusual
noise coming from inside

283
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.740
the abandoned warehouse
located between Nostrand

284
00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.050
and Segway Park.

285
00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:39.470
She also indicated that she observed

286
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:40.770
a suspicious group that appeared

287
00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:42.070
to be inside the vicinity.

288
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:43.880
- And then what happened?

289
00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.160
- We radioed dispatch
that we arrived on scene.

290
00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.194
- We have three officers at the warehouse.

291
00:13:48.194 --> 00:13:49.080
- Scouted out the location.

292
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.830
We then proceeded with caution.

293
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.430
Where we strategically moved
in with our guns drawn.

294
00:13:54.818 --> 00:13:57.390
At which point in time
we entered the warehouse.

295
00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:59.950
And what we discovered was unlike anything

296
00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.600
I'd ever seen in my career as an officer.

297
00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.090
This is officer La Salle.

298
00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:06.100
I need immediate backup
at the abandoned warehouse

299
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:07.500
between Nostrand and Segway.

300
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.490
- Detective La Salle. just so you know.

301
00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:15.780
this is still an active
and ongoing investigation.

302
00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.670
And in case you forgot. I'm
still in charge around here.

303
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:22.424
This interview is now concluded.

304
00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.232
This is Sergeant
Guzman from investigations.

305
00:14:43.232 --> 00:14:45.410
You were supposed to be
in my office an hour ago.

306
00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:46.350
- Ah. shit.

307
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:47.780
Where the hell are you?

308
00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.060
Don't keep me waiting.

309
00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.670
- Yeah. I must have over slept.

310
00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:52.450
I want to see you in my office

311
00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:54.290
in 15 minutes and I mean 15.

312
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:56.080
- I'll be down in 15 minutes.

313
00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:28.800
- Yeah. Susan. I'm gonna
have to call you back.

314
00:15:30.005 --> 00:15:30.838
I have a guest.

315
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:32.713
Come in!

316
00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.730
- Sorry I'm late. Sergeant Guzman.

317
00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:39.980
I got held up in traffic.

318
00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:42.560
Where's Russ?

319
00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.393
- Take a seat.

320
00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:48.753
Russ was transferred to
the southern district.

321
00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:51.340
I'm assuming you didn't hear.

322
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:53.440
- No. I. I.

323
00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.790
- It's because of you and your partner.

324
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:58.450
Now. I'm gonna give you two minutes

325
00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.460
and I mean two. to convince
me why I shouldn't take you

326
00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.450
into custody right now.

327
00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:06.460
- Look. I have something that
might pique your interest.

328
00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.520
There seems to be a connection

329
00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.020
between this guy and the
leader of the clown gang.

330
00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:14.370
- So let me get something straight.

331
00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:16.770
Weren't you taking money from these guys?

332
00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:18.020
- Yeah. but.

333
00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:19.620
- Wait just a minute.

334
00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:21.070
So how does this concern you?

335
00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:23.830
- Gorgeous George has disappeared.

336
00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:26.840
No phone calls. no text messages.

337
00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.770
It's like he fell off
the face of the earth.

338
00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:32.070
- So. maybe he's in jail
where the both of you belong.

339
00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:33.953
- Look. I get it.

340
00:16:33.953 --> 00:16:35.540
But I'm asking you for your help.

341
00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.560
- I don't think you do.

342
00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.470
And if I agree to help you catch

343
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:45.470
this so called clown gang leader.
I want one thing from you.

344
00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:46.440
- Anything.

345
00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.080
- If I help you in any capacity

346
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:51.010
I want you to turn yourself
in immediately after

347
00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:54.260
or I will find your ass
and shoot you myself.

348
00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.333
- Okay. I'll turn myself in.

349
00:16:57.211 --> 00:17:00.110
- Now put your gun and
your badge on the table.

350
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:01.770
And get the hell out of my office.

351
00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:03.830
- With all due respect. Sergeant Guzman--

352
00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:06.317
- Your gun and your badge and get out!

353
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.163
Time can't come soon enough.

354
00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:27.883
- Shit. fuck.

355
00:17:40.934 --> 00:17:43.267
- Listen. I appreciate this.

356
00:17:46.008 --> 00:17:46.933
I hate this cop.

357
00:17:46.933 --> 00:17:49.250

Thank you.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.240

- Fuck. son of a bitch!

Did you see where they went?

375
00:18:37.698 --> 00:18:39.210
- No. I didn't see 'em.

376
00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:40.043
- My mask.

377
00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:43.049
He'll find my fucking mask.

378
00:18:43.049 --> 00:18:43.882

I found the clown gang's hideout.

382
00:19:15.599 --> 00:19:17.998
But you're not gonna
believe who's behind it.

383
00:19:17.998 --> 00:19:21.138
Listen. the address is
1415 Nostrand Avenue.

384
00:19:21.138 --> 00:19:22.700
It's the abandoned warehouse.

385
00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.917
And come quick. because I'm moving in.

386
00:20:22.689 --> 00:20:24.022
Hilo PD. freeze!

387
00:20:25.049 --> 00:20:26.690
Don't fucking move.

388
00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:31.588
Everybody put your hands in
the air where I can see them.

389
00:20:31.588 --> 00:20:34.015
- That voice sounds familiar.

390
00:20:37.713 --> 00:20:39.691
Detective Jones.

391
00:20:39.691 --> 00:20:40.899
Good to see you. man.

392
00:20:40.899 --> 00:20:42.661
- Another fucking stupid ass cop?

393
00:20:42.661 --> 00:20:44.101
- Fuck you.

394
00:20:44.101 --> 00:20:46.405

years since the academy?

395
00:20:46.405 --> 00:20:48.138
- It's been seven. but it doesn't matter.

396
00:20:48.138 --> 00:20:49.481
You're going to jail.

397
00:20:49.481 --> 00:20:51.107
- Oh really?

398
00:20:51.107 --> 00:20:52.731
- I know who you are.

399
00:20:52.731 --> 00:20:55.020
I know all about you.

400
00:21:11.673 --> 00:21:15.173
- You're such a Billy badass. handle that.

401
00:21:22.422 --> 00:21:24.223
- I guess it's just us then.

402
00:21:24.223 --> 00:21:25.970
- I don't think so.

403
00:21:29.234 --> 00:21:30.208
- Come on. Jones.

404
00:21:30.208 --> 00:21:31.615
We know you're not shit.

405
00:21:31.615 --> 00:21:32.868
I know you're not shit.

00:21:32.868 --> 00:21:34.817
You know you're not shit.

I mean hell. the whole
academy knew you weren't shit.

408
00:21:37.643 --> 00:21:39.530

00:22:15.079 --> 00:22:17.802
- This is what happens!

411
00:22:17.802 --> 00:22:18.719
Do you see?

412
00:22:20.075 --> 00:22:20.908
You see?

413
00:22:22.611 --> 00:22:23.444
Huh?

414
00:22:24.622 --> 00:22:25.705
Anybody else!

415
00:22:43.698 --> 00:22:47.082

Okay listen. so here's my thing.

425

427
00:24:59.000 --> 00:24:59.833
- Freeze!

428
00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:04.800
- Another mother fucking pig?

429

- You know.

438
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:26.130
We coulda been great together.

439
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:29.380
- I'm nothing like you.

440
00:25:32.995 --> 00:25:34.580
- I'm gonna give you one last chance

441
00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:35.630
to be a part of this.

442
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:46.380
- Looks like we're gonna
need a new location. fellas.

443
00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:50.003
Not for nothing. he's
one tough son of a bitch.

444
00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:55.193
For a cop.

445
00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:57.740
- Don't tell 'em shit.

446
00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:59.140
- Yo. shut the fuck up. man.

447
00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:01.950
- Who's this asshole?

448
00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.270
- Don't worry. I'll make
your death meaningful.

449
00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:25.720
- Who the fuck are you?

450
00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.346
- That's the fucking cop
I was telling you about.

451
00:26:28.346 --> 00:26:29.381
- Oh yeah.

452
00:26:29.381 --> 00:26:31.290
Word on the street is
you ain't a cop anymore.

453
00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:32.537
- Yeah. that's right.

454
00:26:32.537 --> 00:26:34.110
- You know what. you got
a lot of heart coming here

455
00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:36.000
knowing you don't have
that badge for protection.

456
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.520
- I came here to let
you and your gang know.

457
00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.070
that you're all going to jail.

458
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.903
- Jail?

459
00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:42.950
Is that so?

460
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:45.100
All right. hold up.

461
00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.150
Wasn't it you and your partner.

462
00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:48.770
what the fuck was his name?

463
00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:50.400
Gorgeous George.

464
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.840
Y'all make a deal with us.

465
00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:55.400
He sticks to it. runs
the entire operation.

466
00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.230
You go ahead and act like some
type of fucking boy scout?

467
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:59.660
- Former partner.

468
00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:01.400
- Yo. you know what?

469
00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.260
I've had just about enough you

470
00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:03.920
and the fucking HPD.

471
00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.466
Search this mother fucker.

472
00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:14.813
- I guess you won't be needing this one.

473
00:27:16.102 --> 00:27:18.806
- Name a reason why I
shouldn't smoke your bitch ass.

474
00:27:18.806 --> 00:27:20.857
Matter of fact. yo Chubbs!

475
00:27:31.306 --> 00:27:34.060
- Man you cops. hell of a
fucking nerve. you know that?

476
00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:35.203
- Former cop. asshole.

477
00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:39.960
- Okay. so if that's the
case. answer me this.

478
00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:43.060
You think you can come in here all alone

479
00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:45.160
and nothing's gonna fucking happen to you?

480
00:27:47.492 --> 00:27:48.642
- Who said I was alone?

481
00:27:51.143 --> 00:27:53.726
I brought a few old friends of mine.

482
00:27:55.674 --> 00:27:57.032
- Hilo PD. freeze!

483
00:27:57.032 --> 00:27:58.814
Don't fucking move!
- Don't fucking move!

484
00:27:58.814 --> 00:28:00.484
- Everyone down. don't fucking move!

485
00:28:00.484 --> 00:28:01.797
- Drop that fucking gun!

486
00:28:01.797 --> 00:28:03.083
- Don't fucking move!

487
00:28:03.083 --> 00:28:03.916
- What's it gonna be. KB?

488
00:28:03.916 --> 00:28:04.913
- Drop that fucking gun.

489
00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:08.100
Drop the fucking gun.

490
00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:08.933
Drop it.

491
00:28:08.933 --> 00:28:09.766
- Fuck!

492
00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:15.140
- I know you.

493
00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:17.423
Aren't you that kid we roughed
up back at the precinct?

494
00:28:20.107 --> 00:28:21.337
- Let's go. man. stop playing around.

495
00:28:21.337 --> 00:28:22.204
- Get the fuck off me.

496
00:28:22.204 --> 00:28:23.675
- Let's go!

497
00:28:31.827 --> 00:28:34.370
- This Kara Benaduci reporting live

498
00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:36.310
for Channel 24 News.

499
00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:38.525
Indicated that Detective La Salle.

500
00:28:38.525 --> 00:28:39.900
an eight year veteran of the force

501
00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:42.810
had just 24 hours to turn himself in.

502
00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:44.010
With crime on the rise

503
00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:46.100
there are talks about the
Hilo Police Department's

504
00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:48.640
integrity policy regarding corruption.

505
00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.440
The City Council has proposed defunding

506
00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.510
the department and firing any officers

507
00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:54.363
who violate the misconduct policy.

508
00:29:09.412 --> 00:29:11.662
- I knew I'd find you here.

509
00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:15.980
- You know. this is where me
and my dad used to go fishing.

510
00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.030
It's the only place I've ever found peace

511
00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:19.863
after he died.

512
00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:25.970
- Listen. I really appreciate
what you did back there.

513
00:29:26.965 --> 00:29:29.400
You probably think you saved my ass. huh?

514
00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.808
- What's that. like the 20th time?

515
00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:34.203
- You wish.

516
00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:36.940
So where do we go from here?

517
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:39.800
- Honestly. I don't know.

518
00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:42.210
Now that I'm officially off the force

519
00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:45.120
and I've got less than an
hour to turn myself in.

520
00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.130
I think it's time I faced

521
00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:47.680
the consequences of my actions.

522
00:29:48.991 --> 00:29:50.553
- You sure that's what you wanna do?

523
00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:52.373
- Yeah.

524
00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:55.830
Better do it before I change my mind.

525
00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:58.840
- In that case you give me no choice.

526
00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:02.733
Wilfred La Salle. you're under arrest.

527
00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:07.373
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

528
00:30:08.797 --> 00:30:09.680
in a court of law.

529
00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.186
- Yeah. yeah. I know my rights.

530
00:30:11.186 --> 00:30:12.853
Just get on with it.
