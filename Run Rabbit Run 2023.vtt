You know. you can always tell me
if there's someone bullying you. Mia.

209
00:18:41.416 --> 00:18:44.000
Is there someone bullying you?

210
00:18:49.208 --> 00:18:50.125
Sure?

211
00:18:54.291 --> 00:18:57.375
Why won't you tell me
why you were so upset today. Bunny?

212
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:02.833
Sweetheart?

213
00:19:04.791 --> 00:19:05.875
I miss her.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:50.833
Yeah. maybe.

233
00:20:52.958 --> 00:20:54.125
Come on. homework.

234
00:21:06.208 --> 00:21:10.250
[Mia] So we have to put the trunk
in the family tree about here.

[Sarah] Mmm-hmm.

236
00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:14.541
[Mia] And all the people are the leaves.

237
00:21:14.625 --> 00:21:15.458
[Sarah] Okay.

238
00:21:22.125 --> 00:21:23.208
You know Grandpa?

239
00:21:24.666 --> 00:21:25.500
Hmm?

240
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:26.958
How he died…

241
00:21:28.583 --> 00:21:29.416
Yeah.

242
00:21:30.458 --> 00:21:32.083
And we went to the funeral.

243
00:21:34.125 --> 00:21:34.958
Mmm-hmm.

244
00:21:38.208 --> 00:21:39.375
Was Joan there?

245
00:21:40.833 --> 00:21:41.666
Uh…

246
00:21:42.583 --> 00:21:44.458
No. she wasn't. Bunny.

247
00:21:48.333 --> 00:21:49.166
Why not?

248
00:21:50.625 --> 00:21:51.458
Well…

249
00:21:53.708 --> 00:21:55.958
Uh. she lives very far away.

250
00:21:57.458 --> 00:22:00.500
We need to stick photos in too.
How far away?

251
00:22:02.083 --> 00:22:03.333
Did you say photos?

252
00:22:04.625 --> 00:22:06.875
-Yes.
-Can't we just draw the pictures?

253
00:22:08.625 --> 00:22:10.583
I need photos.

254
00:22:13.125 --> 00:22:14.958
Well. I'm gonna need them back.

255
00:22:37.375 --> 00:22:38.500
[Mia] Where's Joan?

256
00:22:39.708 --> 00:22:40.583
[Sarah] Um…

257
00:22:41.583 --> 00:22:44.125
-I don't have any photos of her.
-Why not?

258
00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:52.916
I haven't seen her in a long time.

259
00:22:54.291 --> 00:22:56.375
I don't stay in touch with her.

260
00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:58.333
Why not?

261
00:23:01.375 --> 00:23:03.500
Well. that's just the way it is. Bunny.

262
00:23:05.208 --> 00:23:07.000
But I need a photo of Joan.

263
00:23:09.375 --> 00:23:12.958
[gasps] Maybe Grandpa
had some in his boxes.

264
00:23:18.791 --> 00:23:20.166
Hmm.

265
00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:21.250
He might.

266
00:23:23.416 --> 00:23:24.375
Please.

267
00:23:28.125 --> 00:23:30.791
Um. you know what?

268
00:23:31.375 --> 00:23:33.000
Maybe we can look tomorrow.

269
00:23:34.916 --> 00:23:35.875
But not tonight.

-That's not for you.

276
00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:02.666
-What are you doing out of bed?
-It's mine. I've been looking for it.

277
00:25:03.916 --> 00:25:06.166
No. it's not. Go back to sleep.

-I know. Bunny.

It was just a dream.

287
00:25:53.333 --> 00:25:54.750
It was just a bad dream.

288
00:26:04.791 --> 00:26:06.500
Did you take this to bed with you?

289
00:26:09.083 --> 00:26:10.041
Why?

290
00:26:11.833 --> 00:26:12.666
It's me.

291
00:26:13.875 --> 00:26:16.625
Uh. I don't want you taking
things that aren't yours.

292
00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:19.000
But it is mine. It's me.

293
00:26:19.583 --> 00:26:20.458
It's not you.

294
00:26:21.666 --> 00:26:23.333
[Mia] How do you know it's not me?

295
00:26:25.041 --> 00:26:27.166
Because it was taken before you were born.

296
00:26:27.666 --> 00:26:28.666
Come on. get in.

297
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:30.625
Go to bed.

00:26:45.791 --> 00:26:46.666
Hang on.

Sweetheart. you-- Did you hurt yourself?

302
00:26:54.666 --> 00:26:56.541
Did someone at school do this to you?

303
00:26:57.958 --> 00:27:00.500
Is-- Mia. is someone hurting you?

304
00:27:06.666 --> 00:27:07.875
I want to see Joan.

305
00:27:09.791 --> 00:27:10.750
Uh…

306
00:27:14.375 --> 00:27:17.291
Well. Joan's… Joan's not well.

307
00:27:18.041 --> 00:27:21.000
Well. maybe if she sees me.
she'll feel better.

308
00:27:21.083 --> 00:27:22.291
I would feel better.

309
00:27:26.166 --> 00:27:30.250
-No. I don't think so. Bunny.
-I want to see Joan.

310

[Mia] I didn't see you hit anything.

You sure?

320
00:29:21.291 --> 00:29:24.375
-Why do you need to look for it?
-Because it might be injured.

321
00:29:25.583 --> 00:29:26.458
[Mia] Then what?

322
00:29:30.416 --> 00:29:31.333

00:29:31.875 --> 00:29:33.583
Well. it might be suffering.

Are we?

329
00:30:28.625 --> 00:30:30.333
Sweetheart. your nose is bleeding.

330
00:30:33.833 --> 00:30:36.833
Jesus. what? How'd that happen? Here.

331
00:30:48.208 --> 00:30:50.458
Um. okay. Let's go.

332
00:30:53.208 --> 00:30:56.458
[Sandy] I appreciate you coming here.
Your mother talks about you.

333
00:30:57.416 --> 00:31:00.000
[Sarah] You said we needed
to discuss her condition.

334
00:31:00.833 --> 00:31:05.583
Now. Sarah. I understand
that your father hoped temporary care here

335
00:31:05.666 --> 00:31:07.625
would provide Joan with respite.

336
00:31:07.708 --> 00:31:10.291
What Dad did for Joan was his business.

337
00:31:10.375 --> 00:31:12.000
I didn't involve myself.

338
00:31:12.083 --> 00:31:15.041
Oh. I understand that.
and I'm sorry for your loss.

339
00:31:15.916 --> 00:31:17.125
Your dad was a kind man.

340
00:31:17.208 --> 00:31:20.250
I'm afraid
it's my responsibility to tell you

341
00:31:20.333 --> 00:31:23.125
that Joan will require ongoing care.

342
00:31:24.291 --> 00:31:27.125
Uh. I'm sorry.
Is this about increased fees?

343
00:31:28.083 --> 00:31:30.750
Uh. there are additional costs but--

344
00:31:30.833 --> 00:31:33.125
Uh. you… You have my email.

345
00:31:33.208 --> 00:31:35.625
I didn't need to come in for this. Sorry.

346
00:31:36.416 --> 00:31:39.875
I know that you may have
phoned Dad all the time.

347
00:31:39.958 --> 00:31:42.500
but I've been explicit
about limiting necessary contact.

348
00:31:42.583 --> 00:31:45.000
I didn't even know he'd put her here
until he was dying.

349
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.583
I know about your estrangement.

350
00:31:49.666 --> 00:31:53.458
But. Sarah. this is not simply
a matter of administration.

351
00:31:55.083 --> 00:31:57.416
Your mother
has been diagnosed with dementia.

352
00:31:59.833 --> 00:32:00.750
I'm so sorry.

353
00:32:03.708 --> 00:32:04.958
Uh. how bad is it?

354
00:32:05.791 --> 00:32:08.041
She's been forgetting to wash herself.

355

356
00:32:10.625 --> 00:32:13.041
She keeps asking for you
in moments of lucidity.

357
00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:16.958
Now. that's a first.

-Yeah.

[Joan gasps]

367
00:32:55.916 --> 00:32:57.041
Alice?

368
00:32:58.291 --> 00:32:59.125
Oh.

369
00:33:00.583 --> 00:33:01.500
Alice.

370
00:33:03.416 --> 00:33:06.208
Joan. this is Mia. Sarah's daughter.

371
00:33:06.291 --> 00:33:08.916
-Mia's your granddaughter.
-[Joan crying] Oh!

372
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.958
I'm here now. Don't be sad.

373
00:33:11.583 --> 00:33:16.250
[crying] Oh. I've missed you so much.
So much.

374
00:33:17.375 --> 00:33:21.083
Where have you been? Where have you been?

375
00:33:21.166 --> 00:33:22.750
I love you so much.

376
00:33:23.708 --> 00:33:27.291
-You belong to me.
-[Sandy] Joan. calm down. Please. Joan.

377
00:33:27.375 --> 00:33:29.500
-Okay. that's enough.
-[Sandy] Joan. let go.

378
00:33:29.583 --> 00:33:31.041
-Get away from me!
-Don't!

379
00:33:31.125 --> 00:33:32.916
-[Sandy] Joan. come on.
-Joan's had enough.

380
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.916
-Let's leave.
-[Mia] No. I don't want to!

381
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.875
-[Joan] Don't leave me!
-I don't want to go!

382
00:33:36.958 --> 00:33:39.583
-Stop. Mia. We're going.
-I don't want to go!

383
00:33:39.666 --> 00:33:41.833

-Let go. please.

384
00:33:41.916 --> 00:33:44.083
-Alice!
-[Mia] I don't want to go!

385
00:33:44.166 --> 00:33:46.000
[Sandy] Calm down. Calm down.

386
00:33:46.083 --> 00:33:48.250
[Joan screaming] Alice! Alice!

387
00:33:48.333 --> 00:33:50.500
No! I don't want to go!

388
00:33:50.583 --> 00:33:51.500
Alice!

389
00:33:51.583 --> 00:33:53.750
-No! I don't want to.
-Mia.

390
00:33:53.833 --> 00:33:57.750
-Stop! Stop!
-Mia. just let me put your seatbelt on.

391
00:33:58.333 --> 00:34:00.291
-Ow!
-[Mia] I don't want to!

392
00:34:00.375 --> 00:34:02.708
-Mia. put your legs inside.
-I want to stay with Joan!

393
00:34:02.791 --> 00:34:05.958
-Put your legs in--
-I want to stay with Joan!

394
00:34:06.041 --> 00:34:07.291
Mia. stop it!

395
00:34:07.375 --> 00:34:08.666
-Oh. God.
-Stop.

396
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:11.208
-Stop it now.
-Stop!

[Sarah grunting]

398
00:34:12.625 --> 00:34:14.958

[Mia screaming]

00:34:17.166 --> 00:34:18.833
Oh. my God. Oh. my God.

401
00:34:19.958 --> 00:34:22.041
Please. baby.
Bunny. let me see. I'm so sorry.

402
00:34:22.125 --> 00:34:23.791
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. sweetheart.

403
00:34:46.125 --> 00:34:47.083
Sweetheart…

404
00:34:50.791 --> 00:34:55.083
I know that you
might not understand why Mummy is…

405
00:34:56.666 --> 00:34:58.833
[door handle rattles]

406
00:34:58.916 --> 00:35:01.291
-Mia. Listen. Mia.
-[unlocks car door]

407
00:35:01.375 --> 00:35:02.583
Wait. I wanna have a conv--

408
00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.500
[eerie music playing]

409
00:35:27.041 --> 00:35:27.958
[woman] Sarah?

410
00:35:30.375 --> 00:35:31.208
Sarah?

411
00:35:32.458 --> 00:35:35.375
I said it looks like
you've both been in the wars.

412
00:35:35.458 --> 00:35:38.083
Oh. Oh. oh. [chuckles awkwardly]

413
00:35:38.166 --> 00:35:39.916
Yeah. it's awful. Yeah.

414
00:35:40.958 --> 00:35:42.000
I didn't mean to.

415
00:35:43.166 --> 00:35:44.041
Obviously.

416
00:35:46.666 --> 00:35:47.750
How are things at home?

417
00:35:48.708 --> 00:35:49.541
Good.

418
00:35:50.375 --> 00:35:52.166
Yeah. I mean. you know. hard.

419
00:35:53.625 --> 00:35:55.875
given the circumstances.
but we're doing okay.

420
00:35:57.291 --> 00:36:01.000
And do you think Mia's coping
with the loss of her grandfather?

421
00:36:02.666 --> 00:36:05.416
Um. what do you mean. "coping"?

422
00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:10.875
Sarah. the school is here to support.

423
00:36:13.208 --> 00:36:16.208
It's clear there's
something troubling Mia. That's all.

424
00:36:18.166 --> 00:36:19.541
Right. well. I-- [sputters]

425
00:36:19.625 --> 00:36:21.875
Yes. I did wonder
whether she's being bullied.

426
00:36:23.708 --> 00:36:26.833
I think it's something
quite different than that.

427
00:36:38.791 --> 00:36:40.041
Sorry. turn it over.

428
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:44.041
[foreboding music playing]

429
00:36:44.125 --> 00:36:47.125
I've been finding these
on the back of her homework.

430
00:36:48.833 --> 00:36:49.916
What? Wha--

431
00:36:51.083 --> 00:36:55.625
Sarah. I think that Mia
is struggling to control her anxiety.

432
00:36:58.875 --> 00:36:59.708
Okay.

433
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.958
Most kids experience anxiety
at some time or another.

434
00:37:05.041 --> 00:37:09.875
You know. things change.
The loss of a loved one is difficult.

435
00:37:10.625 --> 00:37:13.291
But I think that Mia
may need some extra help.

436
00:37:16.583 --> 00:37:18.291
Do you have a good family GP?

437
00:37:20.541 --> 00:37:23.375
Oh. do you mean… professional help?

438
00:37:25.791 --> 00:37:27.500
Look. it can't hurt.

439
00:37:32.583 --> 00:37:35.541
Sweetheart. do you wanna--

440
00:37:35.625 --> 00:37:38.583
Do you wanna talk
about what's been happening lately?

441
00:37:41.583 --> 00:37:43.958
You haven't really been yourself.

442
00:37:45.625 --> 00:37:47.250
[Mia] I don't think I am myself.

443
00:37:51.625 --> 00:37:52.541
What?

444
00:37:54.416 --> 00:37:56.333
What does-- What does that mean. Mia?

445
00:38:00.125 --> 00:38:00.958
Mia?

446
00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:03.833
[Mia] Don't call me that.

447
00:38:10.041 --> 00:38:11.708
I want you to call me Alice.

448
00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:18.250
[eerie music playing]

449
00:38:21.333 --> 00:38:22.500
But your name is Mia.

450
00:38:23.625 --> 00:38:24.583
No.

451
00:38:25.416 --> 00:38:26.333
Alice.

452
00:38:34.625 --> 00:38:35.625
I wanna go home.

453
00:38:44.916 --> 00:38:45.750
Mia!

454
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:47.833
Mia?

455
00:38:56.666 --> 00:38:59.625
[Sarah] Our Dog Knows Words.

456
00:39:00.208 --> 00:39:03.375
-Hmm. that's a pretty clever dog.
-Look.

457
00:39:03.916 --> 00:39:05.833
Oh. yeah. that's nice.

458

[ominous music playing]

459
00:39:17.666 --> 00:39:20.791
-Bunny. you can't draw in library books.
-I didn't.

460
00:39:23.416 --> 00:39:26.375
Mia. you're not gonna get in trouble
if you just tell the truth.

461
00:39:27.083 --> 00:39:28.833
I didn't do anything.

462
00:39:29.375 --> 00:39:31.166
Stop lying to me.

463
00:39:31.791 --> 00:39:33.000
I'm not lying.

464
00:39:33.083 --> 00:39:35.750
Well. you are.
because you've drawn in a library book.

465
00:39:35.833 --> 00:39:36.708
I haven't.

466
00:39:37.375 --> 00:39:40.583
I don't understand
what's going on with you lately. Mia.

467
00:39:41.708 --> 00:39:43.333
I need to see Joan.

468
00:39:43.416 --> 00:39:44.250
What?

469
00:39:47.916 --> 00:39:49.791
Why do you need to see Joan?

470
00:39:50.416 --> 00:39:52.666
You never even met her till yesterday.

471
00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:56.833
She says she loves me and I belong to her.

472
00:39:56.916 --> 00:39:59.916
You don't belong to her.
You… [inhales sharply]

473
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.208
You don't even know her.

474
00:40:04.791 --> 00:40:07.875
She's sick. Bunny.
She doesn't know who you are.

475
00:40:07.958 --> 00:40:10.666
She doesn't know who I am.
She doesn't know who anyone is.

476
00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:12.125
She does know who I am.

477
00:40:12.208 --> 00:40:13.916
No. she doesn't. Mia.

478
00:40:18.125 --> 00:40:20.416
-I'm going to see her.
-No. you're not.

479
00:40:21.708 --> 00:40:23.541
Bunny. you are going to sleep.

480
00:40:34.125 --> 00:40:36.125
[Mia whispering] You're not my real mummy.

481
00:40:38.083 --> 00:40:39.291
I want to go home.

482

[line ringing]

483
00:40:48.958 --> 00:40:50.416
[Denise on phone] Hi. Sarah.

484
00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:51.416
Uh. hi.

485
00:40:52.625 --> 00:40:54.541
Sorry. Hi. Denise. Um…

486
00:40:55.625 --> 00:40:56.583
Is Pete home?

487
00:40:57.208 --> 00:40:59.708
Uh. no. Uh. no. he's not.

488
00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:03.250
Okay. um. could you
just let him know that I called?

489
00:41:03.333 --> 00:41:04.583
It's. uh… It's about Mia.

490
00:41:05.333 --> 00:41:07.250
Yeah. yeah. Is everything okay?

491
00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:09.666
Yeah. everything's fine.

492
00:41:10.541 --> 00:41:13.791
Just need to run a few things past him.

493
00:41:14.875 --> 00:41:16.166
Yeah. Um…

494
00:41:17.041 --> 00:41:18.125
Yeah. of course. Um…

495
00:41:19.416 --> 00:41:23.125
I mean. I'm… I'm always here.
if you need to talk.

496
00:41:25.583 --> 00:41:27.583
Oh. Um…

497
00:41:28.833 --> 00:41:29.875
Great. thanks.

498
00:41:32.958 --> 00:41:34.416
Okay. Um…

499
00:41:35.375 --> 00:41:38.000
Hey. I'm sorry
about what happened with Toby.

500
00:41:38.083 --> 00:41:40.708
I-- I completely understand
why you lost your temper.

501
00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:45.791
It's been really hard for you
with your father's passing and…

502
00:41:50.416 --> 00:41:54.250
Pete mentioned it might have
brought up all that stuff from before

503
00:41:54.333 --> 00:41:55.333
with your sister.

504
00:41:58.166 --> 00:41:59.166
What do you mean?

505
00:42:00.875 --> 00:42:02.625
God. Sarah. I'm so sorry.

506
00:42:03.791 --> 00:42:06.125
I can't imagine
what it must have been like.

507
00:42:11.291 --> 00:42:12.250
Sarah?

508
00:42:13.083 --> 00:42:15.375
No. Denise. You can't.

What?

I thought it was important that she know.

For fuck's sake. Pete.

528
00:46:41.125 --> 00:46:43.000
She's a social worker. Sarah.

529
00:46:43.083 --> 00:46:46.458
She understands. you know.
trauma. family stuff.

530
00:46:46.541 --> 00:46:49.458
She understands nothing.
She doesn't need to understand anything.

-It has nothing to do with her.
-Okay. Okay.

532
00:46:52.791 --> 00:46:53.791
I'm sorry.

How's Mia?

She's fine.

Really?

536
00:47:01.291 --> 00:47:04.750
Because the school called me.
and they said they've spoken to you too.

00:47:08.791 --> 00:47:11.875
She-- [sighs] She wanted--
She wanted to see Joan again.

540
00:47:11.958 --> 00:47:13.541
Then take her. Sarah.

541
00:47:13.625 --> 00:47:16.250
-No. Pete. it's--
-Sarah. it'll be all right.

542
00:47:17.375 --> 00:47:20.375
Take Mia. show her the house.
clear it out. and pack it up.

543
00:47:20.458 --> 00:47:21.666
[Pete sighing]

544
00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:24.416
-Put a fucking lid on it.
-No. Pete--

545
00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:27.625
Sarah. let Mia have
a relationship with her grandma.

546
00:47:39.458 --> 00:47:41.458
[eerie music playing]

547
00:48:06.208 --> 00:48:07.458
Can people come back?

548
00:48:09.875 --> 00:48:12.958
-Come back from where?
-From where they go when they die.

549
00:48:15.375 --> 00:48:16.625
Uh. um…

550
00:48:19.916 --> 00:48:21.291
No. Bunny.

551
00:48:22.416 --> 00:48:24.708
Grandpa said
he would come back as a pelican.

552
00:48:26.166 --> 00:48:27.000
[Sarah] Did he?

553
00:48:27.875 --> 00:48:29.208
I don't remember that.

554
00:48:30.958 --> 00:48:34.791
It was our little secret.
He said he wanted to keep an eye on you.

555
00:49:26.541 --> 00:49:27.875
[Mia] Does Joan live here?

556
00:49:29.541 --> 00:49:31.250
[sighing deeply]

557
00:49:31.333 --> 00:49:32.166
Mum?

558
00:49:33.416 --> 00:49:34.250
No.

559
00:49:35.083 --> 00:49:36.041
No. she used to.

560
00:49:37.916 --> 00:49:40.791
No. this is where
I lived when I was little.

561
00:49:48.416 --> 00:49:50.416
[birds squawking]

562
00:50:02.375 --> 00:50:04.416
[eerie music playing]

563
00:50:36.833 --> 00:50:37.791
[Mia] It's open!

564
00:50:39.333 --> 00:50:40.250
How'd you open it?

565
00:50:42.041 --> 00:50:43.250
Under the pot plant.

566
00:50:44.458 --> 00:50:45.541
Okay. well…

567
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.958
Okay. well. wait. Wait. Mia.

568
00:50:53.791 --> 00:50:54.666
Wait.

569
00:50:57.041 --> 00:50:57.875
Hey. wait.

570
00:51:30.833 --> 00:51:32.833
[Mia running]

571
00:51:35.625 --> 00:51:36.916
[door opens]

572
00:51:38.250 --> 00:51:40.750
[Mia] Hey. I'm gonna sleep in here.

573
00:51:41.875 --> 00:51:42.750
[Sarah] What?

574
00:51:43.708 --> 00:51:45.958
No. Mia. No. hang on.

575
00:51:47.458 --> 00:51:48.625
Look. it's me.

576
00:51:49.583 --> 00:51:51.583
[Sarah] No. it's-- That's not you.

577
00:51:51.666 --> 00:51:52.708
[Mia] Yes. it is.

578
00:51:52.791 --> 00:51:55.250
No. it's not.
Come on. I don't wanna be in here.

579
00:51:56.083 --> 00:51:56.958
Why not?

580
00:51:58.625 --> 00:52:00.583
Uh-- Because I don't! Come on.

581
00:52:00.666 --> 00:52:01.916
But I like it in here.

582
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.500
No. out. Now.

583
00:52:04.166 --> 00:52:05.083
It's my room.

584
00:52:05.708 --> 00:52:06.666
Mia. out.

585
00:52:07.583 --> 00:52:10.250
Come on. out. Get out. I don't want to--

586
00:52:10.333 --> 00:52:12.750
-No.
-I don't want to be in here. Get out.

587
00:52:12.833 --> 00:52:14.750
-No! [screaming]
-Just-- Come on!

588
00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:21.041
You're a terrible person.

589
00:52:33.375 --> 00:52:35.375
[scratching]

590
00:52:52.916 --> 00:52:54.125
What are you drawing?

591
00:52:58.958 --> 00:52:59.958
[Mia] It's for Joan.

592
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:03.833
Oh.

593
00:53:05.833 --> 00:53:06.708
Can't I see?

594
00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:13.041
Can you draw me one after?

595
00:53:14.791 --> 00:53:15.666
[Mia] Okay.

596
00:53:25.708 --> 00:53:26.958
So. you lived here?

597
00:53:27.916 --> 00:53:29.541
Uh. yeah.

598
00:53:30.583 --> 00:53:32.541
Before Grandpa and I moved to the city.

599
00:53:43.375 --> 00:53:44.708
[Mia] Why'd you move away?

600
00:53:47.791 --> 00:53:49.291
Um. I don't…

601
00:53:51.250 --> 00:53:52.750
I don't like to talk about it.

602
00:53:55.333 --> 00:53:56.166
[Mia] Why?

603
00:53:59.625 --> 00:54:01.416
[Mia continues drawing]

604
00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:03.041
Because it makes me sad.

605
00:54:05.833 --> 00:54:06.666
[Mia] Why?

606
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.208
I said I don't want to talk about it. Mia.

607
00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:13.833
[stops drawing]

608
00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:17.791
[Mia] My name is Alice.

609
00:54:21.333 --> 00:54:22.250
Mia…

610
00:54:24.541 --> 00:54:28.291
Mia. I need you to tell me
if someone has said something to you.

611
00:54:29.166 --> 00:54:32.416
Denise… maybe? Or-- or your dad?

612
00:54:37.166 --> 00:54:38.458
[Mia] About what?

613
00:54:41.375 --> 00:54:44.583
If someone has said
something to you about Alice.

614
00:54:45.791 --> 00:54:47.666
[Mia] I am Alice.

615
00:54:49.208 --> 00:54:52.333
Please. [shudders] Mia. this isn't a game.

616
00:54:54.083 --> 00:54:57.333
Tell me if someone has said something
to you that they shouldn't have.

617
00:54:57.416 --> 00:54:59.666
[Mia] No one tells me anything.

618
00:55:08.958 --> 00:55:09.875
Okay.

619
00:55:13.208 --> 00:55:14.375
I had a sister.

620
00:55:17.166 --> 00:55:19.250
Her name was Alice.

621
00:55:25.708 --> 00:55:26.916
Where is she?

622
00:55:30.583 --> 00:55:31.666
She went missing.

623
00:55:33.250 --> 00:55:34.541
A long time ago.

624
00:55:36.708 --> 00:55:38.125
When she was only seven.

625
00:55:40.708 --> 00:55:41.833
I'm back.

626
00:55:41.916 --> 00:55:43.000
I'm your sister.

627
00:55:43.708 --> 00:55:44.750
I'm seven.

628
00:55:46.166 --> 00:55:47.375
Mia…

629
00:55:47.458 --> 00:55:49.083
-Alice.
-Stop it.

630
00:55:51.666 --> 00:55:52.916
[Mia] I'm Alice.

631
00:55:53.708 --> 00:55:55.000
Mia. stop it.

632
00:55:55.083 --> 00:55:56.833
[Mia] I came back. I'm Alice.

633
00:55:56.916 --> 00:55:58.250
Just stop it. Mia.

634
00:55:58.333 --> 00:56:01.041
-It is not fun--
-[loudly] I'm Alice! I'm Alice! I'm Alice!

635
00:56:07.041 --> 00:56:09.291
Mia! Mia.

636
00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:14.916
Mia. look. I know you don't understand.
but it really hurts Mummy…

637
00:56:15.541 --> 00:56:17.375
[Mia breathing heavily]

638
00:56:17.458 --> 00:56:18.458
Bunny.

639
00:56:21.458 --> 00:56:22.458
Oh. sweetheart.

640
00:56:25.458 --> 00:56:26.583
I'll get you a tissue.

641
00:57:21.583 --> 00:57:22.708
[gasps]

642
00:58:05.666 --> 00:58:07.458
[Sandy] Looking forward
to seeing your grandma?

643
00:58:07.541 --> 00:58:11.458
-Yes.
-Excellent. Up here. your first right.

644
00:58:12.958 --> 00:58:15.250
-Mia. Mia.
-I'll be here if you need me.

645
00:58:15.333 --> 00:58:16.458
-[Mia] I'm back!
-Thank you.

646
00:58:19.875 --> 00:58:20.791
Oh.

647
00:58:22.791 --> 00:58:23.875
Sarah.

648
00:58:25.541 --> 00:58:28.625
Oh. we were here before.
and you didn't recognize me.

649
00:58:32.250 --> 00:58:33.375
Mia?

650
00:58:37.125 --> 00:58:38.083
[sighs] Oh.

651
00:58:38.833 --> 00:58:40.583
Thank you for bringing her.

652
00:58:41.625 --> 00:58:42.458
You well?

653
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:44.750
Yeah. we're okay.

654
00:58:45.833 --> 00:58:46.791
[Joan] Your father?

655
00:58:48.791 --> 00:58:49.625
Dad's…

656
00:58:50.708 --> 00:58:52.041
Dad's dead. He died.

657
00:58:52.875 --> 00:58:54.166
Oh. yes. I knew that.

658
00:58:56.833 --> 00:58:57.958
Do you remember me?

659
00:58:59.666 --> 00:59:00.500
[gasps]

660
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:06.666
I've been wanting to meet you
for such a very. very long time.

661
00:59:07.333 --> 00:59:12.166
Albert told me all about you. little Mia.

662
00:59:13.250 --> 00:59:14.083
No.

663
00:59:14.625 --> 00:59:15.458
Alice.

664
00:59:16.041 --> 00:59:17.833
-[Sarah] Uh. Mia.
-[Mia] You called me Alice.

665
00:59:17.916 --> 00:59:19.583
-[Sarah] Mia. stop it.
-I don't understand.

666
00:59:19.666 --> 00:59:22.333
-My name is Alice. You said--
-We're gonna go. Come on.

667
00:59:22.416 --> 00:59:24.416
-Why don't you remember me?
-[Sarah] Mia. come on.

668
00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:25.416
Ow!

669
00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:27.041
I hate you!

670
00:59:29.375 --> 00:59:31.333
[Sarah] Mia. Mia.

671
00:59:33.541 --> 00:59:34.500
Mia!

672
00:59:35.666 --> 00:59:37.666
[birds squawking]

673

[ominous music playing]

674
00:59:47.875 --> 00:59:49.166
It's a long way down.

675
00:59:56.708 --> 00:59:57.958
I wanna show you something.

676
01:00:26.166 --> 01:00:28.041
[soft music playing]

677
01:00:33.791 --> 01:00:34.625
[Sarah] Come on.

678
01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:42.500
[ominous music playing]

679
01:00:55.291 --> 01:00:57.041
[music intensifies and stops abruptly]

680
01:00:59.458 --> 01:01:00.916
[Mia] Can you tell me about her?

681
01:01:04.416 --> 01:01:05.583
Oh. uh…

682
01:01:06.291 --> 01:01:07.875
She was very pretty. [chuckles]

683
01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:13.000
She had. uh… dark hair and freckles.

684
01:01:14.250 --> 01:01:15.208
[Mia] Like me?

685
01:01:20.291 --> 01:01:21.916
Yeah. just like you.

686
01:01:23.125 --> 01:01:24.500
What was she like?

687
01:01:27.791 --> 01:01:28.625
[Sarah] Uh…

688
01:01:29.791 --> 01:01:30.916
We were different.

689
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.791
And we… fought a lot.

690
01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:38.791
Sisters fight a lot.

691
01:01:47.875 --> 01:01:49.083
She liked animals.

692
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.875
She'd. um… She'd find animals
and bring them home and look after them.

693
01:01:58.833 --> 01:02:01.041
What kind of animals? Rabbit?

694
01:02:02.875 --> 01:02:06.875
No. Dogs. And… found a bird once.

695
01:02:09.625 --> 01:02:10.458
[chuckles]

696
01:02:12.166 --> 01:02:15.291
My dad used to catch wild rabbits.

697
01:02:16.333 --> 01:02:17.416
They were pests.

698
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.916
I used to help him check the traps.
but she didn't like that.

699
01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:24.708
Did she like games?

700
01:02:29.375 --> 01:02:30.208
Yeah.

701
01:02:32.125 --> 01:02:33.083
Chasey?

702
01:02:34.208 --> 01:02:35.083
Mmm-hmm.

703
01:02:35.166 --> 01:02:36.166
Hide-and-seek?

704
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:37.916
Mmm-hmm.

705
01:02:39.541 --> 01:02:40.416
No.

706
01:02:43.666 --> 01:02:46.708
I don't like hide-and-seek.
You don't look for me.

707
01:02:47.333 --> 01:02:48.416
Mia?

708
01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:49.875
You don't like me.

709
01:02:50.458 --> 01:02:53.291
You make me hide and hide and hide.

710
01:02:53.375 --> 01:02:55.750
-Mia.
-You make me hide all day.

711
01:02:55.833 --> 01:02:58.625
You don't want to find me. You lock me in.

712
01:02:58.708 --> 01:03:00.041
Stop it. Mia.

713
01:03:00.125 --> 01:03:01.000
[Mia] I hate you!

714
01:03:02.625 --> 01:03:03.458
[Sarah] Mia.

715
01:03:04.791 --> 01:03:05.625
Mia!

716
01:03:07.833 --> 01:03:08.666
Mia.

717
01:03:11.458 --> 01:03:12.625
-Mia.
-[door slams shut]

718
01:03:13.458 --> 01:03:14.375
[Mia] Go away.

719
01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:16.375
-Mia!
-[rattles doorknob]

720
