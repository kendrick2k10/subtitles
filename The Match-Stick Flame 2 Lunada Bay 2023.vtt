3
00:02:17.378 --> 00:02:18.355
- Hello. Agent Prasad.

4
00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:19.667
- Dade. how are you?

5
00:02:19.691 --> 00:02:21.565
- I'm good. how about you?

6
00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:22.808
- Oh. I'm doing pretty good.

7
00:02:22.832 --> 00:02:23.947
- That was a lovely dance.

8
00:02:23.971 --> 00:02:25.362
What were you doing?

9
00:02:25.386 --> 00:02:28.192
- Oh. I was practicing my
dance for my brother's wedding.

10
00:02:28.216 --> 00:02:29.711
- Cool.

11
00:02:29.735 --> 00:02:31.989
- So what article are you
working on for the LA Times?

12
00:02:32.013 --> 00:02:34.613
- I'm now a journalist
for the Hollywood Reporter

13
00:02:34.637 --> 00:02:37.098
with a little informant
work on the side.

14
00:02:37.122 --> 00:02:39.480
- Well. that sounds interesting.

15
00:02:39.504 --> 00:02:42.759
- Thank you. and I
thought you should know

16
00:02:42.783 --> 00:02:44.588
that Dalton is back in town.

17
00:02:44.612 --> 00:02:47.798
- Really. when did he come back?

18
00:02:47.822 --> 00:02:50.146
- Just about
a couple days ago.

19
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.175
- Ah. well. this
is very interesting

20
00:02:55.934 --> 00:02:57.877
and very intriguing.

21
00:02:57.901 --> 00:02:59.327
Thanks for the information. Dade

22
00:02:59.351 --> 00:03:00.570
- No problem.

23
00:03:00.594 --> 00:03:05.230
- Bye.

24
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.731
- Hey. pop. how you doing?

25
00:03:37.043 --> 00:03:39.046
Sorry I haven't been
around for a while.

26
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.956
Just had to get away
after Mr. Tang shot

27
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.257
and killed you a year ago.

28
00:03:45.777 --> 00:03:47.779
Now. I'm back.

29
00:03:49.677 --> 00:03:50.999
I remember the first
time you told me

30
00:03:51.023 --> 00:03:52.542
you were a robotics engineer.

31
00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.869
My first thought was you
operated those Johnny five robots

32
00:03:58.893 --> 00:04:00.619
from the movie. Short Circuit.

33
00:04:01.965 --> 00:04:02.966
Pretty close. right?

34
00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:07.671
I thought that was
the coolest thing

35
00:04:07.695 --> 00:04:09.639
when you took me to
the automobile plant.

36
00:04:09.663 --> 00:04:11.848
and I would watch you
operate robots welding car

37
00:04:11.872 --> 00:04:12.872
and truck parts.

38
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.639
You know. I wanted to
be just like you. pop.

39
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.640
You were my hero.

40
00:04:24.056 --> 00:04:26.207
I wanted to be a
robotics engineer.

41
00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:30.522
I wanted to be a
welder like you.

42
00:04:30.546 --> 00:04:33.134
until the automobile
plant shut down.

43
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.761
you lost your job. mom went
crazy and killed herself.

44
00:04:42.627 --> 00:04:45.561
You know. I ask myself all
the time. just what if?

45
00:04:46.803 --> 00:04:48.505
What if you would've just stayed

46
00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:50.290
in the unemployment line. pop?

47
00:04:52.533 --> 00:04:54.649
What if you didn't meet
Mob Boss Johnny Nero

48
00:04:54.673 --> 00:04:56.296
or accept his bloody money?

49
00:04:58.056 --> 00:04:59.159
We would've been okay.

50
00:05:00.783 --> 00:05:02.923
You would've gotten
another job eventually.

51
00:05:04.338 --> 00:05:07.307
and I think you and I would
be fishing right now together.

52
00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:12.312
but I guess that'll
never happen.

53
00:05:15.901 --> 00:05:17.489
not in this lifetime. anyway.

54
00:05:20.837 --> 00:05:24.910
but on that note. at least
you accepted Jesus Christ

55
00:05:29.225 --> 00:05:33.091
as your personal savior. and
you asked for forgiveness.

56
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.100
So that being said. I'll see
you in heaven someday. pop.

57
00:05:51.212 --> 00:05:52.421
See you around.

58
00:06:31.805 --> 00:06:34.508
- Dalton. what are you doing?

59
00:06:34.532 --> 00:06:35.854
- Agent Prasad?

60
00:06:35.878 --> 00:06:37.234
- Yeah.

61
00:06:37.258 --> 00:06:39.260
- As I live and breathe.

62
00:06:43.332 --> 00:06:45.519
- Why are you trying to
throw away your dog tags?

63
00:06:45.543 --> 00:06:46.520
You earned them.

64
00:06:46.544 --> 00:06:48.453
- I don't want 'em anymore.

65
00:06:48.477 --> 00:06:51.870
I thought if I get
rid of these dog tags.

66
00:06:51.894 --> 00:06:55.149
just maybe I can
move on with my life.

67
00:06:55.173 --> 00:06:57.013
- Are you still
having nightmares

68
00:06:57.037 --> 00:06:59.153
and flashbacks about the war?

69
00:06:59.177 --> 00:07:00.810
- Can't stop having them.

70
00:07:00.834 --> 00:07:02.984
I keep seeing the Taliban
and Al-Qaeda chasing me.

71
00:07:03.008 --> 00:07:05.815
trying to kill me. and I keep
seeing my best friend getting

72
00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:07.955
killed on the battlefield.

73
00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:10.740
These images haunt
me every single day.

74
00:07:13.053 --> 00:07:14.686
- Well. I'm sorry to hear that.

75
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.688
Please don't give up.

76
00:07:16.712 --> 00:07:19.035
You're making progress.

77
00:07:19.059 --> 00:07:23.177
So I have something that
could maybe take your mind off

78
00:07:23.201 --> 00:07:26.214
of your flashbacks and the
nightmares that you're having.

79
00:07:26.238 --> 00:07:27.343
I have a new case.

80
00:07:28.724 --> 00:07:30.943
- Do I have to pass another
one of your field tests?

81
00:07:30.967 --> 00:07:34.326
- No. Dalton. you already
passed my field tests.

82
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:38.019
So have you ever heard
of the Lunada Bay Gang?

83
00:07:38.043 --> 00:07:40.159
- Yeah. I heard of them.

84
00:07:40.183 --> 00:07:43.300
- Okay. yeah. so what they're
doing is they're distributing

85
00:07:43.324 --> 00:07:46.890
this crystallized
cocaine called Galaxy.

86
00:07:46.914 --> 00:07:49.790
and they're distributing
it through the surfers

87
00:07:49.814 --> 00:07:53.966
all over Southern California.
and a lot of them are dying.

88
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:56.072
- I thought Galaxy's
the new big high

89
00:07:56.096 --> 00:07:59.385
with less side effects. and
besides. I killed Mr. Tang.

90
00:07:59.409 --> 00:08:02.458
He was the only Triad leader
who had access to the drug.

91
00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:04.701
who brought it
here to the States.

92
00:08:04.725 --> 00:08:08.360
- I don't know. but somehow
it is being distributed here.

93
00:08:08.384 --> 00:08:11.190
and surfers are ending up dead.

94
00:08:11.214 --> 00:08:14.504
- So when does this
fairy tale begin?

95
00:08:14.528 --> 00:08:16.254
- It's effective immediately.

96
00:08:17.635 --> 00:08:21.269
I need you to find out
who are the distributors.

97
00:08:21.293 --> 00:08:25.170
to get the evidence so that
I can have enough information

98
00:08:25.194 --> 00:08:28.760
to get a warrant so that I can
put these people behind bars

99
00:08:28.784 --> 00:08:30.889
who are killing so
many of these surfers.

100
00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:34.765
- Okay.

101
00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:37.493
- And by the way.
this surfer gang.

102
00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:39.874
they hate undercover agents.

103
00:08:39.898 --> 00:08:42.876
We're still missing
five narcotics agents.

104
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:46.536
They won't hesitate to
kill you if you're made.

105
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.882
So you have to be careful.

106
00:08:47.906 --> 00:08:50.367
- Yeah. I know how it works.

107
00:08:50.391 --> 00:08:51.955
I understand.

108
00:08:51.979 --> 00:08:56.097
- Well. all of the
information is in the packet.

109
00:08:56.121 --> 00:08:57.547
- Okay.

110
00:08:57.571 --> 00:08:59.135
- And by the way. Dalton.

111
00:08:59.159 --> 00:09:01.517
thank you so much
for your service.

112
00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:02.932
I know you brought down a lot

113
00:09:02.956 --> 00:09:06.176
of those Middle East terrorists
that were responsible

114
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.031
for 3.000 deaths during 9/11.

115
00:09:11.999 --> 00:09:13.736
- Of course.

116
00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.876
It's my duty to fight
for those who can't fight

117
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:16.901
for themselves.

118
00:09:18.074 --> 00:09:20.259
- Well. you're never
out of the fight.

119
00:09:20.283 --> 00:09:23.010
- No. I'm never
out of the fight.

120
00:09:34.712 --> 00:09:35.712
- Mother.

121
00:09:36.714 --> 00:09:38.830
- Tiger. what are
you doing here?

122
00:09:38.854 --> 00:09:40.452
You're supposed to be in Mumbai.

123
00:09:40.476 --> 00:09:43.455
- I'm here to take
over father's business.

124
00:09:43.479 --> 00:09:44.939
- What are you gonna do?

125
00:09:44.963 --> 00:09:47.804
- The first thing I'm gonna
do is avenge my father's death

126
00:09:47.828 --> 00:09:49.288
by killing Dalton.

127
00:09:49.312 --> 00:09:53.361
The last time I spoke to father.
he told me. join me or die.

128
00:09:53.385 --> 00:09:57.193
I chose to join him. but Dalton.
he chose to go against him.

129
00:09:57.217 --> 00:09:59.471
Now father is dead
because of Dalton.

130
00:09:59.495 --> 00:10:01.646
- Tiger. I beg you
to let this go.

131
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:04.718
Let Match-Stick's flame die out.

132
00:10:04.742 --> 00:10:07.203
Dalton took down the
syndicate and father

133
00:10:07.227 --> 00:10:08.653
because he did his job.

134
00:10:08.677 --> 00:10:12.208
Match-Stick chose his path
and it killed him. not Dalton.

135
00:10:12.232 --> 00:10:14.106
Dalton will come after you too.

136
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:17.454
- I must fulfill father's
wishes and kill Dalton.

137
00:10:17.478 --> 00:10:19.111
I must leave now.

138
00:10:19.135 --> 00:10:20.941
- Tiger. no. please.

139
00:10:20.965 --> 00:10:22.494
No more death.

140
00:10:22.518 --> 00:10:25.210
I wanted a better life for
you. not a life of crime.

141
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:52.928
- Hey man. what do you think
you're doing around here?

142
00:10:54.723 --> 00:10:58.254
No outsiders are
aloud here. dude.

143
00:10:58.278 --> 00:11:01.498
- Yeah. well last I checked
this is a free country.

144
00:11:01.522 --> 00:11:02.938
- Get outta here. you turd.

145
00:11:07.425 --> 00:11:10.531
- How about. no.
I stay and you go.

146
00:11:19.092 --> 00:11:20.001
- I gotta go.

147
00:11:20.025 --> 00:11:21.542
Let me call you back. bye.

148
00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.078
Dalton. we need to talk.

149
00:11:29.102 --> 00:11:30.320
- About what?

150
00:11:30.344 --> 00:11:31.528
- Why'd you kick that
surfer in the face?

151
00:11:31.552 --> 00:11:33.565
- You gave me
permission to play rough

152
00:11:33.589 --> 00:11:35.325
on the streets. Remember?

153
00:11:35.349 --> 00:11:37.258
- OMG.

154
00:11:37.282 --> 00:11:38.466
- It's time for breakfast.

155
00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:39.467
Let's get a bite to eat.

156
00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:40.491
- All right.

157
00:11:56.198 --> 00:11:57.440
- Let the case begin.

158
00:13:06.475 --> 00:13:07.797
- Are you crazy?

159
00:13:07.821 --> 00:13:09.695
These coves have her
experienced surfers.

160
00:13:09.719 --> 00:13:12.353
You almost got yourself
killed out there.

161
00:13:12.377 --> 00:13:13.551
- I have a death wish.

162
00:13:14.966 --> 00:13:17.289
These coves are
open to everybody.

163
00:13:17.313 --> 00:13:18.901
- No. they're not.

164
00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:21.190
Locals run things here.

165
00:13:21.214 --> 00:13:25.573
You have to earn your spot
here. especially at Lunada Bay.

166
00:13:25.597 --> 00:13:28.335
- Okay. so why aren't you
surfing at Lunada Bay?

167
00:13:28.359 --> 00:13:32.926
- I'm not that good. but this
isn't my first rodeo either.

168
00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.618
and even I have to earn my spot.

169
00:13:35.642 --> 00:13:40.647
- What is so special
about surfing at Lunada Bay?

170
00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:42.694
- It's a locals thing. really.

171
00:13:42.718 --> 00:13:45.317
It all started
back in the 1930s.

172
00:13:45.341 --> 00:13:49.114
and this group of young
surfers got together.

173
00:13:49.138 --> 00:13:51.358
and they created what's
called the Palos Verde Surfers

174
00:13:51.382 --> 00:13:55.603
Club. and it was all just for
fun and surf and friendship.

175
00:13:55.627 --> 00:13:59.641
and then this group of young
trust fund babies came along.

176
00:13:59.665 --> 00:14:02.921
and they started what's
called the Lunada Bay Gang.

177
00:14:02.945 --> 00:14:05.268
then they began bullying
the non-locals away.

178
00:14:05.292 --> 00:14:08.478
and now anyone who attempts
to surf here that's not part

179
00:14:08.502 --> 00:14:13.059
of the gang either winds
up missing or ends up dead.

180
00:14:16.821 --> 00:14:19.558
- Why do you want to
join the Bay Gang anyway?

181
00:14:19.582 --> 00:14:23.769
- Well. my grandfather
and my father surfed

182
00:14:23.793 --> 00:14:24.874
this spot before me.

183
00:14:24.898 --> 00:14:26.427
It's a family tradition.

184
00:14:26.451 --> 00:14:28.902
and I want to be able
to surf this spot too.

185
00:14:30.835 --> 00:14:33.676
and I want to find
the man responsible

186
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.921
for murdering my father.
and I know it's someone

187
00:14:36.945 --> 00:14:37.945
in that gang.

188
00:14:39.637 --> 00:14:40.810
- I know the feeling.

189
00:14:42.433 --> 00:14:44.998
- So why do you wanna
surf here anyway?

190
00:14:45.022 --> 00:14:47.759
- Well. I have nothing to lose.

191
00:14:47.783 --> 00:14:49.761
Both my parents are now dead.

192
00:14:49.785 --> 00:14:51.694
My fiance was
murdered a year ago.

193
00:14:51.718 --> 00:14:54.904
So I figured why not
try something different.

194
00:14:54.928 --> 00:14:56.412
something to free my spirit.

195
00:14:57.448 --> 00:14:58.656
- Oh. I'm sorry.

196
00:14:59.657 --> 00:15:00.657
- Thanks.

197
00:15:01.693 --> 00:15:04.362
- Well. I see
you're a vet also.

198
00:15:04.386 --> 00:15:08.090
- Oh yeah. oh.
Special Ops Forces.

199
00:15:08.114 --> 00:15:10.023
- Wow.
you're a Navy Seal?

200
00:15:10.047 --> 00:15:11.576
- Yeah.

201
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.027
- You really are crazy
then. huh?

202
00:15:14.051 --> 00:15:17.616
- Well. maybe just a little.

203
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.653
- I have to get going now.

204
00:15:19.677 --> 00:15:23.036
- Yeah. thanks for this.

205
00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.071
- You're welcome.

206
00:15:24.095 --> 00:15:26.177
- Hey. what's your name anyway?

207
00:15:26.201 --> 00:15:28.696
- Kiley. Kiley Hall.

208
00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.825
What's your last name?

209
00:15:31.102 --> 00:15:34.840
- Billy Bob. Billy Bob Peters.

210
00:15:36.383 --> 00:15:40.260
- Bob Peters. I don't picture
that as last name for you.

211
00:15:40.284 --> 00:15:45.289
I think more of
a Bale or a Cage.

212
00:15:47.429 --> 00:15:49.407
- Yeah. I like that.

213
00:15:49.431 --> 00:15:50.236
- Well. later.

214
00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:54.401
- Yeah.

215
00:16:03.203 --> 00:16:04.203
Hey.
- Hey.

216
00:16:05.205 --> 00:16:06.586
- Might have first contact.

217
00:16:08.036 --> 00:16:10.773
I need you to run a background
check on the name Kiley Hall.

218
00:16:10.797 --> 00:16:13.569
She's a local here in
the Palos Verdes estates

219
00:16:13.593 --> 00:16:15.985
and run a background
check on her father too.

220
00:16:16.009 --> 00:16:17.469
I think his murder may
have something to do

221
00:16:17.493 --> 00:16:18.677
with the Lunada Bay Gang.

222
00:16:18.701 --> 00:16:20.127
- Why do you think that?

223
00:16:20.151 --> 00:16:23.027
- Because Kiley Hall told me
that she wants to join the gang

224
00:16:23.051 --> 00:16:24.062
because she believes somebody

225
00:16:24.086 --> 00:16:25.891
in that gang killed her father.

226
00:16:25.915 --> 00:16:28.308
- Oh. okay. that makes sense.

227
00:16:28.332 --> 00:16:29.965
All right. I'll get
on it right away.

228
00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:31.380
- Great. thanks.

229
00:16:31.404 --> 00:16:32.405
We'll be in touch.

230
00:16:36.443 --> 00:16:37.662
Sorry I'm late.

231
00:16:37.686 --> 00:16:39.940
The 110 was backed
up with traffic.

232
00:16:39.964 --> 00:16:41.079
- Oh. no problem.

233
00:16:41.103 --> 00:16:42.103
No worries.

234
00:16:43.347 --> 00:16:47.489
So I got the information that
you wanted about Kiley Hall.

235
00:16:48.904 --> 00:16:52.194
Inside this file. you
will find that Kiley Hall

236
00:16:52.218 --> 00:16:54.851
is the daughter of Patrick Hall.

237
00:16:54.875 --> 00:16:59.028
and her grandfather's
name is Warren Doc Hall.

238
00:16:59.052 --> 00:17:00.650
- So what did these
people have to do

239
00:17:00.674 --> 00:17:02.031
with the Lunada Bay Gang?

240
00:17:02.055 --> 00:17:07.060
- So it's the newer
generations of the Bay Boys.

241
00:17:08.165 --> 00:17:09.590
They're the ones
that grew up corrupt.

242
00:17:09.614 --> 00:17:12.455
and they were very
unfriendly to anyone

243
00:17:12.479 --> 00:17:14.733
that didn't belong
there who would come

244
00:17:14.757 --> 00:17:19.762
into their territory. and
if you didn't pay a tax

245
00:17:20.901 --> 00:17:23.880
or listen to what they
were saying to do.

246
00:17:23.904 --> 00:17:25.227
they would end up dead.

247
00:17:25.251 --> 00:17:28.116
So in 2019. surfers
started ending up dead.

248
00:17:29.393 --> 00:17:31.257
- So what happened
to Kiley's father?

249
00:17:32.465 --> 00:17:37.297
- Kiley's father ended
up dying in 2010.

250
00:17:38.436 --> 00:17:42.209
The case file says
that it was a suicide.

251
00:17:42.233 --> 00:17:45.764
However. there's really
no reason for him

252
00:17:45.788 --> 00:17:47.963
to jump off Pelican Cove Cliff.

253
00:17:49.102 --> 00:17:52.288
So this is the suicide
note that he wrote.

254
00:17:52.312 --> 00:17:53.312
- Okay.

255
00:18:03.392 --> 00:18:06.475
Okay. I get it.

256
00:18:06.499 --> 00:18:09.236
Sounds like a case of
rich. over-privileged.

257
00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:12.170
trust fund pieces of garbage
who took a family clubhouse

258
00:18:12.194 --> 00:18:15.725
pass-down and turned it
into a big drug operation.

259
00:18:15.749 --> 00:18:18.866
- Exactly. the police here.

260
00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:21.006
they don't think that
there's anything wrong

261
00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:22.215
with the Bay Boys.

262
00:18:22.239 --> 00:18:24.665
They think that it's
just a dumb click.

263
00:18:25.622 --> 00:18:27.012
But that's not the facts.

264
00:18:27.036 --> 00:18:28.255
- Right.

265
00:18:28.279 --> 00:18:31.293
- So what I need you to
do is collect evidence.

266
00:18:31.317 --> 00:18:34.986
I need you to find out
who the distributors are.

267
00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.506
and I need you to get
me back this information

268
00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:41.096
so we can take down these
scumbags. and remember.

269
00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.616
you cannot commit any felonies.

270
00:18:46.021 --> 00:18:48.506
If you do. this
operation gets shut down.

271
00:18:49.921 --> 00:18:53.660
- Oh. okay. I understand.

272
00:18:53.684 --> 00:18:55.064
Do my best.
- Okay.

273
00:19:06.835 --> 00:19:10.366
- Kiley. you ready to
join our gang or what?

274
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:12.057
- I am.

275
00:19:12.081 --> 00:19:14.267
- Let's see what you got.

276
00:20:12.935 --> 00:20:15.811
Excellent surfing
out there. Kiley.

277
00:20:15.835 --> 00:20:18.089
Your father would be proud.

278
00:20:18.113 --> 00:20:20.471
- You know I'm still looking
for my father's killer.

279
00:20:20.495 --> 00:20:22.783
<font size="41">- Sounds like
somebody has daddy issues.</font>

280
00:20:22.807 --> 00:20:25.776
- Happy hunting. Kiley.

281
00:20:26.915 --> 00:20:29.859
- So am I part of
your bay gang or what?

282
00:20:29.883 --> 00:20:32.231
- No. you're not in
the gang. Mickey.

283
00:20:33.439 --> 00:20:36.763
- What the. you respect
my board on this beach.

284
00:20:36.787 --> 00:20:39.755
- Nobody surfs with a
leash on in the bay.

285
00:20:46.279 --> 00:20:48.361
- There's one more test.

286
00:20:48.385 --> 00:20:50.363
- I thought this was
a locals-only test?

287
00:20:50.387 --> 00:20:52.054
- We run the business
a lot differently

288
00:20:52.078 --> 00:20:53.907
than your grandfather
and father did.

289
00:20:54.805 --> 00:20:56.185
the stakes are higher.

290
00:20:57.394 --> 00:20:59.268
We like to be sketchy!

291
00:20:59.292 --> 00:21:02.098
- Wooh!

292
00:21:02.122 --> 00:21:04.204
- What exactly do I have to do?

293
00:21:04.228 --> 00:21:06.989
- The real test is
just beginning. Kiley.

294
00:21:20.382 --> 00:21:21.382
- Lex.

295
00:21:22.522 --> 00:21:24.155
- Kiley.
- Yeah.

296
00:21:24.179 --> 00:21:25.846
- I'm surprised you showed up.

297
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:27.296
- I'm here.

298
00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.815
- You ready for your final test?

299
00:21:28.839 --> 00:21:29.943
- What is this test?

300
00:21:31.255 --> 00:21:32.255
- Wolf.

301
00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:36.985
- Here it is. boss.

302
00:21:40.299 --> 00:21:41.586
- What is this?

303
00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:42.610
- Mickey.

304
00:21:47.789 --> 00:21:49.870
- You ready for your
final test. Kiley?

305
00:21:49.894 --> 00:21:50.895
- I don't understand.

306
00:21:52.207 --> 00:21:54.140
- Are you in or are you out?

307
00:21:57.661 --> 00:21:59.224
- I don't understand.

308
00:21:59.248 --> 00:22:02.400
I don't. no. no. my family
didn't start the bay gang

309
00:22:02.424 --> 00:22:05.738
in the 1930s to kill
innocent people.

310
00:22:06.773 --> 00:22:07.682
- Do it!

311
00:22:07.706 --> 00:22:10.581
- No. I'm not killing anyone!

312
00:22:10.605 --> 00:22:12.686
- You're not gonna get
away with this. Lex.

313
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:14.895
20 years to life.

314
00:22:14.919 --> 00:22:16.093
I have a wife.

315
00:22:17.474 --> 00:22:18.314
I have a kid.

316
00:22:18.338 --> 00:22:20.453
- No. don't kill him!

317
00:22:22.927 --> 00:22:27.425
- Which one
of you killed my father?

318
00:22:27.449 --> 00:22:28.289
- I did it!

319
00:22:28.313 --> 00:22:29.910
I killed him!

320
00:22:29.934 --> 00:22:30.934
- Why?

321
00:22:31.971 --> 00:22:34.846
- Because he didn't have
the balls or the brains.

322
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:37.642
He wasn't going in the
same direction. Kiley.

323
00:22:37.666 --> 00:22:40.117
We run the bay a little
bit differently now.

324
00:22:55.477 --> 00:22:58.283
There's nothing more
powerful than killing a man!

325
00:22:58.307 --> 00:22:59.307
Take him away!

326
00:23:09.388 --> 00:23:10.399
- Give me your arm.
- No.

327
00:23:10.423 --> 00:23:11.332
- Give it up!

328
00:23:11.356 --> 00:23:12.850
- Please don't do this.

329
00:23:12.874 --> 00:23:13.714
Guys. please don't do this.
- You don't want

330
00:23:13.738 --> 00:23:14.886
to make my arm slip.

331
00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:16.843
- Please don't do this.

332
00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.709
- Welcome to the gang.

333
00:23:31.168 --> 00:23:31.972
- I gotta go.

334
00:23:31.996 --> 00:23:32.996
I'll call you back.

335
00:23:34.654 --> 00:23:36.242
Dalton. are you okay?

336
00:23:37.519 --> 00:23:38.693
- No. I'm not okay.

337
00:23:39.521 --> 00:23:40.557
It's Kiley Hall.

338
00:23:42.006 --> 00:23:44.882
I just met this woman a few
days ago at Malcolm Cove.

339
00:23:44.906 --> 00:23:48.472
She was the only lead we had
so far. and now she's dead.

340
00:23:48.496 --> 00:23:50.059
- Are you kidding?

341
00:23:50.083 --> 00:23:51.188
- No. I'm not kidding.

342
00:23:52.051 --> 00:23:54.512
- I'm sorry she's dead.

343
00:23:54.536 --> 00:23:55.962
Did she drown?

344
00:23:55.986 --> 00:23:58.965
- No. she didn't drown.

345
00:23:58.989 --> 00:24:00.059
Here. come here. look.

346
00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:08.423
See the needle marks on her arm?

347
00:24:08.447 --> 00:24:10.483
- Yes. I do see
the needle marks.

348
00:24:11.933 --> 00:24:14.705
- We need to get an autopsy
report on her right away.

349
00:24:14.729 --> 00:24:16.292
- Yeah. I agree.

350
00:24:16.316 --> 00:24:19.157
- She was a good
swimmer and surfer. too.

351
00:24:19.181 --> 00:24:22.540
All she wanted to do was find
out who murdered her father.

352
00:24:22.564 --> 00:24:24.818
She knew it was someone
in that Lunada Bay Gang

353
00:24:24.842 --> 00:24:27.234
but just didn't know
exactly who did it.

354
00:24:27.258 --> 00:24:30.652
- Yeah. we really need to get
cracking on this case as soon

355
00:24:30.676 --> 00:24:32.988
as possible. 'cause we're
running out of time.

356
00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:35.300
- Yeah.

357
00:24:56.218 --> 00:24:59.232
- Gentlemen. I'm
glad you could make it.

358
00:24:59.256 --> 00:25:02.708
- Here you go. clear cut
Galaxy straight from China.

359
00:25:04.088 --> 00:25:06.273
You must have some strong
connections to be doing business

360
00:25:06.297 --> 00:25:08.034
with me. my man.

361
00:25:08.058 --> 00:25:09.173
I don't recognize you.

362
00:25:09.197 --> 00:25:10.657
You with the Hollywood mob?

363
00:25:10.681 --> 00:25:11.681
You a new runner?

364
00:25:19.587 --> 00:25:20.909
- I'm not a runner.

365
00:25:20.933 --> 00:25:23.832
The name is Tiger.
Tiger Match-Stick.

366
00:25:26.007 --> 00:25:27.916
- You just say Match-Stick?

367
00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:29.573
- Did I stutter?

368
00:25:29.597 --> 00:25:31.264
- But you're Indian. bro.

369
00:25:31.288 --> 00:25:33.128
- Yeah. I'm half Indian.

370
00:25:33.152 --> 00:25:35.199
Match-Stick had an
affair with my mother

371
00:25:35.223 --> 00:25:38.651
while he was making his run
with Mob Boss Johnny Nero

372
00:25:38.675 --> 00:25:40.204
in the late eighties.

373
00:25:40.228 --> 00:25:41.436
So I am Match-Stick.

374
00:25:42.851 --> 00:25:44.933
- I heard he got killed
by the Triads a year ago.

375
00:25:44.957 --> 00:25:47.304
I do know that one of
his sons is a detective.

376
00:25:48.512 --> 00:25:49.869
but all I could find
were pictures of him

377
00:25:49.893 --> 00:25:53.286
when he was a young boy
before his disappearance

378
00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:56.278
after the FBI took
Match-Stick away.

379
00:25:57.970 --> 00:26:01.525
- I run Bollywood and
now I run Hollywood.

380
00:26:02.906 --> 00:26:05.425
- I hate to burst your bubble.
but we were on Hollywood.

381
00:26:06.565 --> 00:26:09.544
I respect the name
Match-Stick and all.

382
00:26:09.568 --> 00:26:10.983
but that name's of the past.

383
00:26:24.237 --> 00:26:25.836
- The fact that I'm
Match-Stick's son.

384
00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:28.390
and it's in his will
that I take over.

385
00:26:28.414 --> 00:26:30.530
I claim power over
Hollywood now.

386
00:26:30.554 --> 00:26:31.463
Is that understood?

387
00:26:31.487 --> 00:26:34.247
- Okay. okay. no problem.

388
00:26:35.663 --> 00:26:37.192
Well. can we negotiate?

389
00:26:37.216 --> 00:26:39.677
- I don't think you're in any
position to negotiate with me.

390
00:26:39.701 --> 00:26:40.782
- Let's just talk. man.

391
00:26:40.806 --> 00:26:42.773
I got a plan. help you out.

392
00:26:52.541 --> 00:26:55.037
Listen. we have
all the contacts.

393
00:26:55.061 --> 00:26:57.719
and we have the power
for all the distribution.

394
00:26:59.203 --> 00:27:01.388
Let us keep that power over
all the Southern California

395
00:27:01.412 --> 00:27:02.759
beaches and coves.

396
00:27:03.622 --> 00:27:05.358
We can partner up. my man.

397
00:27:05.382 --> 00:27:08.178
You run the Hollywood
streets. we do the coastlines.

398
00:27:09.248 --> 00:27:11.571
It'd be good business
for everybody.

399
00:27:11.595 --> 00:27:12.976
- You do make a valid point.

400
00:27:14.391 --> 00:27:15.391
- But Lex?

401
00:27:16.531 --> 00:27:17.532
- Trust me. Mickey.

402
00:27:18.637 --> 00:27:19.637
This will be good.

403
00:27:39.347 --> 00:27:42.661
- Dude. where'd you
get that board. man?

404
00:27:43.834 --> 00:27:46.043
I want to know where
did you get this board?

405
00:27:47.666 --> 00:27:49.091
- Hands off me. man.

406
00:27:49.115 --> 00:27:50.334
What're you talking about?

407
00:27:50.358 --> 00:27:51.198
I bought this board
with my own money.

408
00:27:51.222 --> 00:27:52.681
- You're a nark. nark!

409
00:27:52.705 --> 00:27:53.545
- What's going on. bro?

410
00:27:53.569 --> 00:27:54.614
Who are you?

411
00:27:54.638 --> 00:27:55.547
- This guy's a nark. man.

412
00:27:55.571 --> 00:27:57.721
This is my brother's board.

413
00:27:57.745 --> 00:27:58.929
He was pinched for narcotics

414
00:27:58.953 --> 00:28:00.437
and was confiscated
two months ago.

415
00:28:06.029 --> 00:28:11.034
- That's his brother's board!

416
00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:32.548
All right. all
right. that's enough.

417
00:28:32.572 --> 00:28:35.586
- I hate narks. man. hate
these undercover narks!

418
00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:37.001
- Hate cops.

419
00:28:37.025 --> 00:28:38.313
Let's get outta here. man.

420
00:28:38.337 --> 00:28:39.659
Let's go. let's go.

421
00:28:39.683 --> 00:28:41.937
Hey. man. you want to go
grab something to eat?

422
00:28:50.142 --> 00:28:53.052
- Have you completely
lost your mind?

423
00:28:53.076 --> 00:28:55.640
You almost killed
one of my agents.

424
00:28:55.664 --> 00:28:57.677
- Hey. if I haven't stepped
in and kicked the crap

425
00:28:57.701 --> 00:28:59.161
out of that undercover agent.

426
00:28:59.185 --> 00:29:00.818
the Bay Boys
would've killed him.

427
00:29:00.842 --> 00:29:02.475
I saved that man's life.

428
00:29:02.499 --> 00:29:04.822
You have no idea.
and on top of that.

429
00:29:04.846 --> 00:29:07.445
he went in with a confiscated
surfboard that belonged

430
00:29:07.469 --> 00:29:10.448
to one of the Lunada Bay
Gang member's brother.

431
00:29:10.472 --> 00:29:12.519
real smooth agent Prasad.

432
00:29:12.543 --> 00:29:14.452
We're off to a great start!

433
00:29:14.476 --> 00:29:16.592
- Well. I was just trying
to help with this case.

434
00:29:16.616 --> 00:29:19.319
- Like I told you before.
I like to work alone.

435
00:29:19.343 --> 00:29:22.806
This way. if I screw up.
it's just me who gets killed.

436
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:25.187
You know the one thing that
kept me alive during my tours

437
00:29:25.211 --> 00:29:26.879
in the Middle East was
that I didn't think

438
00:29:26.903 --> 00:29:28.397
about the world back home.

439
00:29:28.421 --> 00:29:31.159
I didn't think about mommy and
daddy having relationships.

440
00:29:31.183 --> 00:29:34.058
getting married. having
kids. living in a big house

441
00:29:34.082 --> 00:29:35.750
with a white. picket fence.

442
00:29:35.774 --> 00:29:38.614
I didn't think about any of
that. because if I would have.

443
00:29:38.638 --> 00:29:40.858
I would've gotten
distracted and killed.

444
00:29:40.882 --> 00:29:42.584
and I've seen it happen.

445
00:29:42.608 --> 00:29:44.482
What I'm saying to
you. Agent Prasad.

446
00:29:44.506 --> 00:29:49.073
is that I'm 100% involved
and committed to this case.

447
00:29:49.097 --> 00:29:50.695
- Okay. that sounds good.

448
00:29:50.719 --> 00:29:52.214
That's what I want to hear.

449
00:29:52.238 --> 00:29:53.412
- Don't worry about it.

450
00:29:54.309 --> 00:29:55.794
I'm going back to work.

451
00:30:29.103 --> 00:30:30.656
- Get off my wave. man.

452
00:30:45.119 --> 00:30:46.579
- Is this the punk?

453
00:30:46.603 --> 00:30:48.563
- That's the dude who tried
to cut me off my wave.

454
00:30:49.986 --> 00:30:51.204
- I get it.

455
00:30:51.228 --> 00:30:53.344
This is a whole
local thing. right?

456
00:30:53.368 --> 00:30:55.622
I'm surfing on your territory.

457
00:30:55.646 --> 00:30:56.727
I'm sorry. man.

458
00:30:56.751 --> 00:30:58.487
I don't want any problems. okay?

459
00:30:58.511 --> 00:30:59.764
It's not like I
went to your house

460
00:30:59.788 --> 00:31:01.663
and took a crap on
your lawn or something.

461
00:31:01.687 --> 00:31:03.665
- It's close enough. bro.

462
00:31:03.689 --> 00:31:05.356
- Listen. bullhead. the land

463
00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.220
and the ocean is
open to everybody.

464
00:31:07.244 --> 00:31:08.843
So why don't you
guys just walk away

465
00:31:08.867 --> 00:31:10.396
so none of you get hurt?

466
00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.363
I haven't had my
breakfast this morning.

467
00:31:12.387 --> 00:31:14.779
You know what happens when
I don't get my breakfast

468
00:31:14.803 --> 00:31:15.608
in the morning?

469
00:31:15.632 --> 00:31:16.541
- What?

470
00:31:16.565 --> 00:31:19.232
- I get real grumpy. like this.

471
00:31:30.302 --> 00:31:31.106
- Back off. Leo!

472
00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:31.935
He's with me!

473
00:31:31.959 --> 00:31:32.867
- Leave it. Lex.

474
00:31:32.891 --> 00:31:33.834
You know if this was your turf.

475
00:31:33.858 --> 00:31:35.755
you'd be doing the same thing.

476
00:31:40.864 --> 00:31:44.395
- Say goodnight!

477
00:31:44.419 --> 00:31:48.907
- Let's get outta here. man.
before the cops get here.

478
00:31:54.429 --> 00:31:55.959
- Okay. Detective.
you're all set.

479
00:31:55.983 --> 00:31:57.512
I'm gonna leave
you some medicine

480
00:31:57.536 --> 00:31:58.858
for your pain.
- Thanks.

481
00:31:58.882 --> 00:32:00.066
- Take that every
four hours. okay?

482
00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:01.333
- Yeah. yeah.

483
00:32:02.299 --> 00:32:03.656
- You gotta watch your limits.

484
00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.520
You gotta know what
your limits are.

485
00:32:05.544 --> 00:32:08.350
You gotta limit what you're
doing out in the field. okay?

486
00:32:08.374 --> 00:32:09.720
- I have no limits.

487
00:32:11.101 --> 00:32:13.148
- That's gonna be your downfall.

488
00:32:13.172 --> 00:32:17.083
- The mind could subjugate
anything. even real pain.

489
00:32:17.107 --> 00:32:19.051
- Detective. take
your medication.

490
00:32:19.075 --> 00:32:21.398
You're absolutely insane.

491
00:32:21.422 --> 00:32:24.919
- Yeah. well. I left my sanity
back at the war on terror.

492
00:32:24.943 --> 00:32:25.954
- Call me when you need me.

493
00:32:25.978 --> 00:32:27.645
You know I'm there for you.

494
00:32:27.669 --> 00:32:29.924
- Great. thanks. Doc.

495
00:32:38.749 --> 00:32:43.754
- Dalton. two surfers are in
the hospital because of you.

496
00:32:44.928 --> 00:32:47.493
One is in intensive
care with broken ribs

497
00:32:47.517 --> 00:32:49.357
and multiple contusions.

498
00:32:49.381 --> 00:32:51.600
Are you still fighting the war?

499
00:32:51.624 --> 00:32:55.225
- Yeah. I believe I was
back in the war on terror.

500
00:32:55.249 --> 00:32:58.953
- All right. well. you gotta
get a handle on your PTSD.

501
00:32:58.977 --> 00:33:01.220
because you're gonna
end up killing somebody.

502
00:33:02.428 --> 00:33:03.947
- Thanks for the advice.

503
00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:05.810
I'll try.

504
00:33:06.639 --> 00:33:08.641
- All right. you're welcome.

505
00:33:26.176 --> 00:33:27.912
- You guys ready to ride?

506
00:33:27.936 --> 00:33:29.731
Ready to ride with the Bay Boys?

507
00:33:30.629 --> 00:33:32.193
- Which gang are you from?

508
00:33:32.217 --> 00:33:33.321
- I'm alone.

509
00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:36.576
- Where are you from?

510
00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.682
- I was originally born
in Milwaukee. Wisconsin.

511
00:33:38.706 --> 00:33:40.684
but my parents moved
me out to Los Angeles

512
00:33:40.708 --> 00:33:41.847
when I was real little.

513
00:33:43.297 --> 00:33:45.851
- Sounds like we got ourselves
of cheese head over here. huh?

514
00:33:49.924 --> 00:33:53.548
- Sounds like someone's
running from something. Bob.

515
00:33:55.033 --> 00:33:57.425
- Why do you wanna
surf all of a sudden?

516
00:33:57.449 --> 00:34:00.152
- I just wanted to try
something different. you know?

517
00:34:00.176 --> 00:34:02.419
Find my window to enlightenment.

518
00:34:03.593 --> 00:34:06.675
- Stick with us. bro.
and we will show you

519
00:34:06.699 --> 00:34:08.952
to the window of enlightenment.

520
00:34:08.976 --> 00:34:09.976
Let's ride.

521
00:34:12.601 --> 00:34:14.028
- You got the stud. man.

522
00:34:14.052 --> 00:34:15.052
- Yeah.

523
00:34:40.078 --> 00:34:41.424
- Can I trust you. man?

524
00:34:42.321 --> 00:34:44.403
- Of course you can trust me.

525
00:34:44.427 --> 00:34:47.613
You saw I took out
that undercover agent.

526
00:34:47.637 --> 00:34:50.547
Stupid nark. those
people make me sick.

527
00:34:50.571 --> 00:34:53.228
- That was inspiring. that
beating you gave that man.

528
00:34:54.954 --> 00:34:56.449
To new friends.

529
00:34:56.473 --> 00:35:00.719
<font size="41"> To new friends. to standing
on the board. trying.</font>

530
00:35:04.102 --> 00:35:06.321
I'm gonna hit the
head. finish our beers.

531
00:35:06.345 --> 00:35:08.047
and we'll head out. man.

532
00:35:08.071 --> 00:35:09.555
- All right.

533
00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:13.294
- Hey. Giovanni.
where's the bathrooms?

534
00:35:13.318 --> 00:35:14.536
- Just go straight
through the kitchen.

535
00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:15.710
first door on the right.

536
00:35:15.734 --> 00:35:16.505
- All right.
- You're all set.

537
00:35:16.529 --> 00:35:17.632
- Back in a few minutes.

538
00:35:29.817 --> 00:35:31.001
Ash?

539
00:35:31.025 --> 00:35:32.658
I knew I could hear
you sniffing out there.

540
00:35:32.682 --> 00:35:35.109
- Dalton. what are
you doing here?

541
00:35:35.133 --> 00:35:36.903
- I was looking for the bathroom

542
00:35:36.927 --> 00:35:38.974
and then I hear all this.

543
00:35:38.998 --> 00:35:40.700
You still doing this stuff. man?

544
00:35:40.724 --> 00:35:43.047
- Man. this is my
business here. all right?

545
00:35:43.071 --> 00:35:44.463
I got a lot of businesses.

546
00:35:44.487 --> 00:35:46.568
This business. this business.
they're all businesses.

547
00:35:46.592 --> 00:35:49.019
The shitter is over there
if you need to use it.

548
00:35:49.043 --> 00:35:52.056
Snorting all that cocaine. I
thought you'd be dead by now.

549
00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.128
- Look. I can see I
got a little fatter.

550
00:35:54.152 --> 00:35:55.750
but you got a little uglier.

551
00:35:55.774 --> 00:35:57.855
- What happened to Godmothers?

552
00:35:57.879 --> 00:35:59.409
- I own multiple businesses.

553
00:35:59.433 --> 00:36:01.065
See. I'm a businessman.

554
00:36:01.089 --> 00:36:02.964
Look. look carefully.

555
00:36:02.988 --> 00:36:05.829
This is what a businessman
looks like. okay?

556
00:36:05.853 --> 00:36:06.830
I know that's not what you do.

557
00:36:06.854 --> 00:36:08.107
- I see.
- You run around

558
00:36:08.131 --> 00:36:09.626
and like to punch
and shoot people.

559
00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:11.145
but I'm a businessman here.

560
00:36:11.169 --> 00:36:12.870
Your father still
owes me that money.

561
00:36:12.894 --> 00:36:14.355
and that means you
owe me that money.

562
00:36:14.379 --> 00:36:15.701
'cause you're related to him.

563
00:36:15.725 --> 00:36:16.634
You are his kid.

564
00:36:16.658 --> 00:36:19.073
- I don't owe you jack squat!

565
00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:24.917
- Well. you do now. and I
want my jack and my squat.

566
00:36:24.941 --> 00:36:27.161
and you can go take a squat
in the shitter over there.

567
00:36:27.185 --> 00:36:29.093
and when you're done.
bring me my money!

568
00:36:29.117 --> 00:36:34.122
- Listen. pee stain. I fought
for this country. okay?

569
00:36:34.985 --> 00:36:36.145
I've fought for this freedom.

570
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:37.964
Get a life.

571
00:36:37.988 --> 00:36:40.174
- I got one. baby.

572
00:36:40.198 --> 00:36:42.900
It's gonna take a lot
to take me down. huh?

573
00:36:42.924 --> 00:36:44.937
You wanna get into
a tumble again?

574
00:36:44.961 --> 00:36:46.456
Let's go.

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:47.871

That's the purest

It's called Galaxy.

621
00:39:25.639 --> 00:39:27.537

- I don't know. Lex.

628
00:39:52.976 --> 00:39:55.576
I kind of got my
own thing going on.

629
00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.199
Besides. I thought you only
hang out with the best surfers

630
00:39:58.223 --> 00:39:59.223
in the west.

631
00:40:01.122 --> 00:40:04.022
- Join us or die like the rest.

632
00:40:05.713 --> 00:40:07.543
- Oh. I heard that line before.

633
00:40:09.096 --> 00:40:10.580
The answer is no. Lex.

634
00:40:14.584 --> 00:40:16.931
- What's your real name. man?

635
00:40:18.381 --> 00:40:19.762
- Billy Bob Peters.

636
00:40:21.902 --> 00:40:22.948
So go ahead.

637
00:40:22.972 --> 00:40:25.778
Come on. Lex. shoot me.

638
00:40:25.802 --> 00:40:30.645
Let me help you. right there
in the middle of my forehead.

639
00:40:30.669 --> 00:40:31.669
Pull it!

640
00:40:33.016 --> 00:40:35.512
- Bang. bang. bang.

641
00:40:35.536 --> 00:40:37.341
- I'm dead.
- This guy's crazy. man.

642
00:40:37.365 --> 00:40:39.205
- He could be.

643
00:40:39.229 --> 00:40:43.130
You might be on to something.
man. a really crazy guy.

644
00:40:45.443 --> 00:40:46.868
- It's a party. huh?

645
00:40:46.892 --> 00:40:48.076
We're gonna have
some good times.

646
00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:48.906
Let's party.

647
00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:50.044
- It's a party. man.

648
00:40:50.068 --> 00:40:51.068
- Yeah. it is.

649
00:40:56.592 --> 00:40:58.328
- Hey. how's it going?

650
00:40:58.352 --> 00:40:59.571
- Just peachy.

651
00:40:59.595 --> 00:41:01.365
- So excellent work.

652
00:41:01.389 --> 00:41:04.438
I was able to buy us some
more time on the case.

653
00:41:04.462 --> 00:41:06.636
you know. before the
feds have to take over.

654
00:41:07.948 --> 00:41:09.926
- It's Mr. Tang's son. Bolo.

655
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:11.962
He took over the
family business.

656
00:41:11.986 --> 00:41:13.136
- Really?

657
00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:14.378
- Mm hmm.

658
00:41:14.402 --> 00:41:16.346
- Well. at least we know
that Galaxy has stayed

659
00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:17.796
within the family.

660
00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:20.523
So now that we know who
the distributors are.

661
00:41:20.547 --> 00:41:23.836
how are they getting this
stuff through US Customs?

662
00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:25.493
- Lex has contacts
there and he's paying

663
00:41:25.517 --> 00:41:27.461
off the US Custom agents.

664
00:41:27.485 --> 00:41:31.810
- Oh. so do you think
that Bolo recognizes you?

665
00:41:31.834 --> 00:41:33.387
Does he know who you are?

666
00:41:34.561 --> 00:41:36.021
- So far. the only
thing he knows is

667
00:41:36.045 --> 00:41:38.782
that a detective
shot his father.

668
00:41:38.806 --> 00:41:41.740
- Well. if he makes
you. you are a dead man.

669
00:41:42.638 --> 00:41:43.994
- Yeah.

670
00:41:44.018 --> 00:41:45.513
- So tell me about
the other Triad.

671
00:41:45.537 --> 00:41:46.514
- Zang?

672
00:41:46.538 --> 00:41:48.126
Zang is Bolo's younger brother.

673
00:41:51.025 --> 00:41:54.522
If they told me that Galaxy
is more organic compared

674
00:41:54.546 --> 00:41:58.492
to ordinary cocaine mixed
with other harmful chemicals.

675
00:41:58.516 --> 00:42:00.494
then why are all these
surfers turning up dead

676
00:42:00.518 --> 00:42:01.978
from this drug?

677
00:42:02.002 --> 00:42:05.188
And it's not even considered
the amount of an overdose.

678
00:42:05.212 --> 00:42:07.949
What I'm saying is it's
either the Bay Gang

679
00:42:07.973 --> 00:42:09.813
or the Triads mixing this stuff

680
00:42:09.837 --> 00:42:12.644
with other harmful chemicals.

681
00:42:12.668 --> 00:42:14.784
- I do not think
it's the Triads.

682
00:42:14.808 --> 00:42:17.511
It's definitely the
Lunada Bay Gang.

683
00:42:17.535 --> 00:42:20.721
There's fentanyl involved.
and we're investigating this.

684
00:42:20.745 --> 00:42:24.207
Do the Triads distribute
to other surfer gangs?

685
00:42:24.231 --> 00:42:26.440
- No. just the Bay Boys.

686
00:42:27.545 --> 00:42:29.971
Listen. I need more money.

687
00:42:29.995 --> 00:42:33.009
There's a big deal coming
up. and I want a piece of it.

688
00:42:33.033 --> 00:42:37.520
- All right. Dalton.
here's $50.000.

689
00:42:38.832 --> 00:42:43.043
- Great. well listen.
I better get going.

690
00:42:44.907 --> 00:42:46.401
Don't wanna blow my cover.

691
00:42:46.425 --> 00:42:49.819
- Hey. be careful
and just remember.

692
00:42:49.843 --> 00:42:54.813
I gave you permission to perform
misdemeanors. not felonies.

693
00:42:55.573 --> 00:42:56.573
- Such a party pooper.

694
00:42:59.335 --> 00:43:01.106
Take care. see you later.

695
00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:03.315
- All right. yeah. whatever.

696
00:43:28.088 --> 00:43:30.435
Hey. bro. glad I caught you.

697
00:43:33.127 --> 00:43:35.381
I'm ready to join your gang.

698
00:43:35.405 --> 00:43:37.684
I wanna work with you.
not just buy it for me.

699
00:43:39.133 --> 00:43:41.595
- Once you're a Bay Boy.
you're a Bay Boy for life.

700
00:43:41.619 --> 00:43:43.079
- I understand.

701
00:43:43.103 --> 00:43:44.701
I have some high-powered.
high-paying clientele.

702
00:43:44.725 --> 00:43:46.600
and they wanna do
business with us.

703
00:43:46.624 --> 00:43:47.797
- Can I trust you?

704
00:43:48.971 --> 00:43:50.455
- Yeah. you can trust me.

705
00:43:51.939 --> 00:43:53.285
- Give me a sec.

706
00:43:54.217 --> 00:43:55.217
- All right.

707
00:44:01.052 --> 00:44:05.549
- Sell this. but I got
one question for you.

708
00:44:05.573 --> 00:44:06.861
- Yeah. go ahead.

709
00:44:06.885 --> 00:44:08.449
- Why the sudden transformation?

710
00:44:08.473 --> 00:44:10.554
What'd you used to do for work?

711
00:44:10.578 --> 00:44:12.626
- I was a criminal
defense attorney.

712
00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:15.180
I kept people like
you outta jail.

713
00:44:15.204 --> 00:44:17.320
- Shady characters.

714
00:44:17.344 --> 00:44:18.839
I bet you won a
lot of settlements.

715
00:44:18.863 --> 00:44:20.772
That's how you have
that extra green. huh?

716
00:44:20.796 --> 00:44:23.188
- That. plus I'm
a trust fund kid.

717
00:44:23.212 --> 00:44:25.777
- That makes sense.
and one more thing.

718
00:44:25.801 --> 00:44:27.123
- Yeah.

719
00:44:27.147 --> 00:44:28.780
- Teach me those moves?

720
00:44:28.804 --> 00:44:31.565
- Yeah. I could teach
you some kung fu moves.

721
00:44:33.015 --> 00:44:35.994
if you can teach me how to
stay on that board better.

722
00:44:36.018 --> 00:44:37.029
I'm in.

723
00:44:37.053 --> 00:44:38.203
- I guess it's a fair trade.

724
00:44:38.227 --> 00:44:39.307
- Yeah. bro.

725
00:44:39.331 --> 00:44:40.240
All right.
- Let's do this.

726
00:44:40.264 --> 00:44:41.368
- I'm gonna go sell this.

727
00:44:47.339 --> 00:44:48.339
Hey.
- Hey.

728
00:44:49.376 --> 00:44:51.941
- Listen. I need you to
put in my personal file

729
00:44:51.965 --> 00:44:54.184
that I'm a criminal
defense attorney.

730
00:44:54.208 --> 00:44:57.878
I need fabricated certificates.
news clippings. wins.

731
00:44:57.902 --> 00:44:59.776
- And why do I need to do that?

732
00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:02.700
- Because Lex is gonna do
a background check on me.

733
00:45:03.735 --> 00:45:05.886
- Okay. makes sense. all right.

734
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:08.164
- We're on to the
next step in our case.

735
00:45:08.188 --> 00:45:09.303
- Sounds good.

736
00:45:09.327 --> 00:45:12.513
- Talk to you later.

737
00:48:21.622 --> 00:48:22.622
- Coming.

738
00:48:29.009 --> 00:48:31.470
Prasad. what are you doing here?

739
00:48:31.494 --> 00:48:33.369
Did you come here to
bring me coffee or donuts

740
00:48:33.393 --> 00:48:35.854
or did you come here
to blow my cover?

741
00:48:35.878 --> 00:48:36.914
So what's going on?

742
00:48:38.294 --> 00:48:41.021
- Another surfer ended
up dead along the shores.

743
00:48:43.644 --> 00:48:46.589
- I'm really getting
sick of tired

744
00:48:46.613 --> 00:48:48.477
of all these surfers
turning up dead.

745
00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:52.170
- Yes. it was at Malaga Cove.

746
00:48:53.792 --> 00:48:54.792
- What happened?

747
00:48:55.553 --> 00:48:56.979
- It's the Bay Boys.

748
00:48:57.003 --> 00:49:00.327
They're mixing up the
crystals from the Triads.

749
00:49:00.351 --> 00:49:02.225
- What are they mixing it with?

750
00:49:02.249 --> 00:49:05.701
- They're mixing
it with 25I-NBOMe.

751
00:49:07.772 --> 00:49:10.682
Another surfer ended up dead.

752
00:49:10.706 --> 00:49:12.856
and the surfer's name was Wang.

753
00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:17.885
The toxicology report states
that it was the combination

754
00:49:19.025 --> 00:49:22.028
of the 25I-NBOMe
mixed with fentanyl.

755
00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:24.789
- What exactly is 25I-NBOMe?

756
00:49:25.721 --> 00:49:28.803
- It's a very dangerous drug.

757
00:49:28.827 --> 00:49:32.738
19 deaths have happened
so far in 10 months.

758
00:49:32.762 --> 00:49:35.155
It started in
Rancho Palos Verdes.

759
00:49:35.179 --> 00:49:38.089
and it's spreading
all along the beaches

760
00:49:38.113 --> 00:49:39.804
of Los Angeles County.

761
00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:43.473
- Okay. if the Triads
find out what Lex

762
00:49:43.497 --> 00:49:46.476
and his gang is doing with
their Galaxy crystals.

763
00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:48.709
he's dead where he stands.

764
00:49:49.917 --> 00:49:51.609
- It's getting too
dangerous. Dalton.

765
00:49:52.817 --> 00:49:54.829
I think we should
call in the feds.

766
00:49:54.853 --> 00:49:56.900
- Just do me a favor. all right?

767
00:49:56.924 --> 00:49:58.868
Don't call in the feds.

768
00:49:58.892 --> 00:50:03.597
- I can put an APB out on
Lex. and I think that you need

769
00:50:03.621 --> 00:50:06.151
to go into the witness
protection program.

770
00:50:06.175 --> 00:50:08.143
I have a very bad
feeling about this.

771
00:50:09.523 --> 00:50:13.365
- If you do that. Lex will
pull out and disappear forever.

772
00:50:13.389 --> 00:50:15.747
We almost have enough evidence
of this case to put him

773
00:50:15.771 --> 00:50:18.508
and his gang away
for a lifetime.

774
00:50:18.532 --> 00:50:20.752
If the feds take over now.
they're gonna ruin months

775
00:50:20.776 --> 00:50:24.021
of hard work and put
fingerprints all over our evidence.

776
00:50:26.299 --> 00:50:27.759
I just need one more day.

777
00:50:27.783 --> 00:50:31.935
After tomorrow. after tomorrow
when Lex introduces me

778
00:50:31.959 --> 00:50:34.835
to his high end clientele.
everyone's gonna be there.

779
00:50:34.859 --> 00:50:38.459
the investors. the Triads
are gonna be going there.

780
00:50:38.483 --> 00:50:40.451
a new Hollywood
crime boss is going.

781
00:50:41.831 --> 00:50:43.464
After tomorrow. we'll
have our full case

782
00:50:43.488 --> 00:50:45.363
against the Lunada Bay Gang.

783
00:50:45.387 --> 00:50:47.503
The judge will issue
us the warrants.

784
00:50:47.527 --> 00:50:51.093
We'll get the green light and
then it's open season on them.

785
00:50:51.117 --> 00:50:53.774
but just gimme
that one more day.

786
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:59.470
- Okay. Dalton. you have
one more day and that's it.

787
00:51:01.265 --> 00:51:02.300
- You gotta trust me.

788
00:51:05.372 --> 00:51:06.372
Hey. it's me.

789
00:51:07.443 --> 00:51:08.938
- Hello. Dalton.

790
00:51:08.962 --> 00:51:12.286
- Listen. I'm on my way to
the brake and tire shop now.

791
00:51:12.310 --> 00:51:14.668
- Why are you going
there. Dalton?

792
00:51:14.692 --> 00:51:16.773
- Because Lex is starting
the meeting with the high-end

793
00:51:16.797 --> 00:51:21.502
clientele business investors
early. and I have to go.

794
00:51:21.526 --> 00:51:24.402
- Okay. wait for me to
come with Agent Mao.

795
00:51:24.426 --> 00:51:25.506
You need some backup.

796
00:51:25.530 --> 00:51:26.990
You need to listen to me.

797
00:51:27.014 --> 00:51:28.923
Follow my orders.

798
00:51:28.947 --> 00:51:31.236
- Listen. we're so close.

799
00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:33.400
We can finish this case today.

800
00:51:37.887 --> 00:51:40.935
Before the feds take
over and ruin everything.

801
00:51:40.959 --> 00:51:43.110
- I have a very bad
feeling about this.

802
00:51:43.134 --> 00:51:44.078
Just wait for me.

803
00:51:44.102 --> 00:51:45.585
I'm calling Agent Mao now.

804
00:51:49.175 --> 00:51:50.600
- I'm going.

805
00:51:50.624 --> 00:51:51.624
I'm going.

806
00:52:05.881 --> 00:52:07.124
- Welcome. gentlemen.

807
00:52:08.677 --> 00:52:10.275
Put this on.

808
00:52:10.299 --> 00:52:11.483
The fumes get pretty strong.

809
00:52:11.507 --> 00:52:12.726
We wouldn't want our
highest paying customer

810
00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:14.510
to get addicted to
drugs. would we?

811
00:52:15.718 --> 00:52:16.961
Right this way.

812
00:52:20.689 --> 00:52:23.357
All of our crystals dissolve
overnight in gasoline.

813
00:52:23.381 --> 00:52:25.314
rendering them
completely undetectable.

814
00:52:28.041 --> 00:52:30.423
Here. we have a coffee
bean filled with cocaine.

815
00:52:31.872 --> 00:52:35.266
Section one is cocaine right
over here. Columbia's finest.

816
00:52:35.290 --> 00:52:40.202
Section two. Galaxy. the new
crystal direct from China.

817
00:52:40.226 --> 00:52:41.651
In three. heroin.

818
00:52:41.675 --> 00:52:45.207
If you thought all of
these quiet. suburban teens

819
00:52:45.231 --> 00:52:47.854
were living quiet and easy
lives. well. think again.

820
00:52:48.993 --> 00:52:51.937
These young teens
and mothers. fathers.

821
00:52:51.961 --> 00:52:53.756
some of our highest
paying clientele.

822
00:52:54.861 --> 00:52:56.414
We're start in
Ranchos Palos Verdes.

823
00:52:57.450 --> 00:52:59.152
swamped Southern California.

824
00:52:59.176 --> 00:53:01.637
Now we are selling
Galaxy all over the US.

825
00:53:01.661 --> 00:53:06.044
which is why we've developed
a new product. Red Dragon.

826
00:53:07.908 --> 00:53:09.393
- What is Red Dragon?

827
00:53:11.498 --> 00:53:13.096
- Red dragon is a
highly addictive.

828
00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:14.156
pleasurable narcotic.

829
00:53:15.088 --> 00:53:16.088
- Which is?

830
00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:22.026
- Well. I'd tell you. but
then I'd have to kill each

831
00:53:22.889 --> 00:53:24.867
and every last one of you.

832
00:53:26.272 --> 00:53:28.526
- Starting with Tiger back here.

833
00:53:28.550 --> 00:53:31.184
- And the Triads are okay with
you distributing their Galaxy

834
00:53:31.208 --> 00:53:32.657
with your own narcotics.

835
00:53:34.521 --> 00:53:36.775
- Let's just say
it's a surprise.

836
00:53:36.799 --> 00:53:39.019
- I don't think the
Triads like surprises.

837
00:53:39.043 --> 00:53:41.055
They already killed
Mob Boss Johnny Nero

838
00:53:41.079 --> 00:53:42.919
and my father. Match-Stick.

839
00:53:42.943 --> 00:53:47.717
- Whoa. Tiger. that's why you
were invited to this party.

840
00:53:47.741 --> 00:53:49.950
Make sure none of
us cross the line.

841
00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:52.929
- Of course. we'd make you
an offer you will not want

842
00:53:52.953 --> 00:53:54.517
to refuse.

843
00:53:54.541 --> 00:53:57.071
- We have two new
delivery methods.

844
00:53:57.095 --> 00:54:00.133
pure Galaxy and
self-inject able needles.

845
00:54:02.273 --> 00:54:05.528
This is liquified Galaxy in
a bag with a needle attached.

846
00:54:05.552 --> 00:54:08.669
One squeeze of the bag.
pure Galaxy directly

847
00:54:08.693 --> 00:54:09.798
into the bloodstream.

848
00:54:12.283 --> 00:54:14.986
- The first shipment
of Red Dragon is ready.

849
00:54:15.010 --> 00:54:17.264
Waiting your call. my friend.

850
00:54:17.288 --> 00:54:19.473
- We are ready to
make a purchase.

851
00:54:19.497 --> 00:54:21.154
- Of course. of course.

852
00:54:22.535 --> 00:54:26.031
- I knew I'd you
here. you traitor.

853
00:54:26.055 --> 00:54:27.378
- Excuse me. who are you?

854
00:54:27.402 --> 00:54:28.620
Do I know you?

855
00:54:28.644 --> 00:54:30.588
- I am the worst nightmare.

856
00:54:30.612 --> 00:54:31.934
- Yeah. and I'm Mary Poppins!

857
00:54:31.958 --> 00:54:34.799
- Haha. funny man.
I have news for you.

858
00:54:34.823 --> 00:54:36.663
Your cover's compromised now.

859
00:54:36.687 --> 00:54:37.940
- Yeah. so is your face.

860
00:54:37.964 --> 00:54:39.252
- Hey. what's the
problem here. fellas?

861
00:54:39.276 --> 00:54:41.840
- This guy is a nark.
Dalton Match-Stick.

862
00:54:41.864 --> 00:54:46.155
son of Match-Stick. the big.
crime fighting detective.

863
00:54:46.179 --> 00:54:47.432
- Who recruited you?

864
00:54:47.456 --> 00:54:48.916
- Mr. Rogers.

865
00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:51.115
- Lex. our investor's leaving.

866
00:54:52.806 --> 00:54:54.750
- Man. I gave you
everything. most importantly.

867
00:54:54.774 --> 00:54:58.132
I gave you my trust.
the shirt off my back.

868
00:54:58.156 --> 00:54:59.858
You stepped on
your own nuts. pal.

869
00:54:59.882 --> 00:55:02.136
- I'm not your pal. dick face!

870
00:55:24.217 --> 00:55:27.196
Hey. Lex. I'm sure the
Triads will love to hear

871
00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:29.405
how you're mixing your
pure Galaxy crystals

872
00:55:29.429 --> 00:55:31.614
with other harmful
drugs and chemicals.

873
00:55:31.638 --> 00:55:34.020
not to mention that
locals are dying from it.

874
00:55:35.193 --> 00:55:36.516
- It is what it is.

875
00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:41.545
- Well then.

876
00:55:42.753 --> 00:55:43.730
- What do you want
me to do with him?

877
00:55:43.754 --> 00:55:45.100
- Take him to the boat.

878
00:55:58.320 --> 00:55:59.849
- You failed your mission.

879
00:55:59.873 --> 00:56:02.956
- Back off big red.

880
00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:03.889
- I got this.

881
00:56:03.913 --> 00:56:06.811
- We'll see about that.

882
00:56:16.821 --> 00:56:20.974
- This is Agent Prasad at
14160 Crenshaw Boulevard

883
00:56:20.998 --> 00:56:23.217
at the brake and tire
Shop in.

884
00:56:23.241 --> 00:56:24.874
I need backup immediately.

885
00:56:24.898 --> 00:56:25.898
Send the feds now.

886
00:56:32.527 --> 00:56:33.527
- Come on!

887
00:57:04.904 --> 00:57:05.904
- Stand him up!

888
00:57:06.837 --> 00:57:07.837
- Get up.

889
00:57:11.635 --> 00:57:14.372
- Father wanted me to kill you
if something happened to him

890
00:57:14.396 --> 00:57:16.650
and if you didn't join us.

891
00:57:16.674 --> 00:57:18.307
- You're wrong. Tiger.

892
00:57:18.331 --> 00:57:20.792
Father changed before he died.

893
00:57:20.816 --> 00:57:22.932
became a born again Christian.

894
00:57:22.956 --> 00:57:23.956
- You lie!

895
00:57:25.096 --> 00:57:25.902
Throw his ass over!

896
00:57:25.926 --> 00:57:27.478
- Sure thing. boss!

897
00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:51.814
- This is 1L90 requesting an RA

898
00:58:51.838 --> 00:58:53.816
at the Royal Palms State Beach.

899
00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:56.888
An officer is down suffering
from head injuries.

900
00:58:56.912 --> 00:59:01.306
unconscious at this time. and
it looks like he's gonna need

901
00:59:01.330 --> 00:59:03.343
some immediate
medical attention.

902
00:59:03.367 --> 00:59:04.793
Please respond. code three.

903
00:59:04.817 --> 00:59:07.278
Get that ambulance out
here as soon as possible.

904
00:59:07.302 --> 00:59:09.028
This is an emergency. out.

905
00:59:19.625 --> 00:59:20.625
- Okay.

906
00:59:25.631 --> 00:59:27.494
Let's see what we got.

907
00:59:35.088 --> 00:59:36.894
There's a lot of
insurgents down there.

908
00:59:36.918 --> 00:59:38.333
We're gonna get fubared now.

909
00:59:43.441 --> 00:59:45.133
General. hey.
we're on the clock.

910
00:59:46.203 --> 00:59:47.203
- I'm ready.

911
00:59:48.826 --> 00:59:50.424
- What did I tell you about
thinking about the world

912
00:59:50.448 --> 00:59:51.449
back home. man.

913
00:59:52.589 --> 00:59:54.083
Thinking about the
world back home.

914
00:59:54.107 --> 00:59:56.465
you're gonna get distracted.
all caught up in emotions

915
00:59:56.489 --> 00:59:57.489
and killed.

916
01:00:00.907 --> 01:00:04.024
- I don't think we're gonna
make it outta here alive. man.

917
01:00:04.048 --> 01:00:05.578
There are a hundred insurgents.

918
01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:07.362
and we're the last
two of our unit.

919
01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:11.238
- We're gonna get you back
home to your wife and daughter.

920
01:00:11.262 --> 01:00:13.171
We just gotta take
care of this one thing

921
01:00:13.195 --> 01:00:15.542
and then get back to
the rendezvous point.

922
01:00:17.234 --> 01:00:18.901
Do you remember Mr.
Shuffle's history class

923
01:00:18.925 --> 01:00:20.489
back in middle school?

924
01:00:20.513 --> 01:00:22.940
Remember when he told us
how 300 Spartans could hold

925
01:00:22.964 --> 01:00:26.081
off 100.000 to 150.000
Persians during the Battle

926
01:00:26.105 --> 01:00:27.105
of Thermopylae?

927
01:00:28.383 --> 01:00:30.603
Even though it's just you
and me left in our unit.

928
01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:32.042
we have a fighting chance.

929
01:00:33.664 --> 01:00:36.080
- If I die today. I'm
glad I'm with you.

930
01:00:40.464 --> 01:00:41.810
- Hey. I got Rossi in sight.

931
01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:45.780
- Good. take the shot and
let's get out of here.

932
01:00:47.816 --> 01:00:48.990
- I don't have the shot.

933
01:00:50.439 --> 01:00:53.142
This is Lionheart
to Fox Trot Alpha.

934
01:00:53.166 --> 01:00:55.282
Be advised. I have
the package in sight

935
01:00:55.306 --> 01:00:57.205
but no shot. no shot.

936
01:00:59.448 --> 01:01:02.082
There's too many innocent
people down there.

937
01:01:02.106 --> 01:01:03.245
- Take them all out.

938
01:01:04.695 --> 01:01:06.259
- Yeah. we do that. we're
gonna get Court Marshaled

939
01:01:06.283 --> 01:01:07.778
for murdering innocent people.

940
01:01:07.802 --> 01:01:09.044
We're gonna have to wait.

941
01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:14.474
We're too close.

942
01:01:14.498 --> 01:01:15.499
We gotta fall back.

943
01:01:18.847 --> 01:01:21.367
Fall back.

944
01:02:09.587 --> 01:02:12.314
- Dalton. I need
your help. help!

945
01:02:16.387 --> 01:02:20.816
-American!

946
01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:25.845
- You're gonna die!

947
01:02:27.053 --> 01:02:29.297
- You're gonna die!

948
01:02:36.683 --> 01:02:38.420
No. no. no. no!

949
01:02:38.444 --> 01:02:42.010
- You bastards killed nearly
3.000 innocent people on 9/11.

950
01:02:42.034 --> 01:02:44.322
On behalf of the United
States of America.

951
01:02:44.346 --> 01:02:47.153
I pledge allegiance
to the flag.

952
01:02:53.631 --> 01:02:57.083
Chandler. Chandler.
stay with me. breathe.

953
01:03:05.298 --> 01:03:06.655
Come on. Dalton.

954
01:03:06.679 --> 01:03:08.830
You have to pull through.

955
01:03:08.854 --> 01:03:10.245
I need you.

956
01:03:10.269 --> 01:03:11.718
I can't lose you too.

957
01:03:12.685 --> 01:03:13.997
You can do it. Dalton.

958
01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:16.527
I know you can do it.

959
01:03:16.551 --> 01:03:17.966
You have to get better.

960
01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:19.899
Come on. Dalton.

961
01:03:25.284 --> 01:03:28.528
Dr. Connor. may I
please speak with you?

962
01:03:29.736 --> 01:03:31.635
- Yes. would you
step outside. please?

963
01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:35.340
- Hello?

964
01:03:35.364 --> 01:03:36.478
- Hey. can I help you?

965
01:03:36.502 --> 01:03:39.619
- My name is
Detective Jim Myers.

966
01:03:39.643 --> 01:03:43.312
and I'm looking for a
Match-Stick. first name. Dalton.

967
01:03:43.336 --> 01:03:45.314
- Right down the hall. room six.

968
01:03:45.338 --> 01:03:46.823
- That way?
- Yeah.

969
01:03:54.934 --> 01:03:58.155
- Dr. Connor. what
is your prognosis?

970
01:03:58.179 --> 01:04:00.181
How do you think
Dalton is really doing?

971
01:04:01.285 --> 01:04:03.298
- Agent. it's too early
to tell right now.

972
01:04:03.322 --> 01:04:05.265
Based on the trauma to his body.

973
01:04:05.289 --> 01:04:06.609
it's about a 50/50
at this moment.

974
01:04:14.954 --> 01:04:17.795
- Like I said in the front
of the police station.

975
01:04:17.819 --> 01:04:18.993
partners until the end.

976
01:04:19.925 --> 01:04:21.996
Well. this is the end.

977
01:04:23.618 --> 01:04:25.723
- What do you think
you're doing. Jake?

978
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:29.772
- Eventually my part
doesn't matter what I say.

979
01:04:29.796 --> 01:04:31.257
I was going do it.

980
01:04:31.281 --> 01:04:32.672
- Well. that makes you no
better than Match-Stick.

981
01:04:32.696 --> 01:04:37.159
- I know. but it makes
me feel so much better.

982
01:04:54.235 --> 01:04:57.835
- L90. show me code six at
2421 Pacific Coast Highway

983
01:04:57.859 --> 01:04:59.423
on a shooting investigation.

984
01:04:59.447 --> 01:05:01.459
requesting two additional units.

985
01:05:01.483 --> 01:05:02.899
Responding code three.

986
01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:20.721
I got you covered!

987
01:05:20.745 --> 01:05:22.746
Go to the car right now!

988
01:05:33.653 --> 01:05:34.734
You guys okay?

989
01:05:34.758 --> 01:05:36.529
Anybody get injured?

990
01:05:36.553 --> 01:05:37.771
- I'm okay.

991
01:05:37.795 --> 01:05:39.290
That's one heck
of a wake up call.

992
01:05:39.314 --> 01:05:41.948
I guess Jake's still out to
avenge his parents' murders.

993
01:05:41.972 --> 01:05:44.847
- I can't believe this guy
won't let it go all this time.

994
01:05:44.871 --> 01:05:46.539
- Jake has gone section eight.

995
01:05:46.563 --> 01:05:49.266
I've never seen him so deranged.

996
01:05:49.290 --> 01:05:50.508
- Let me get you
guys outta here.

997
01:05:50.532 --> 01:05:53.063
I got a safe house for
you up in Big Bear Lake.

998
01:05:53.087 --> 01:05:54.202
- Sounds good. Chief.

999
01:05:54.226 --> 01:05:55.513
Take us there now.

1000
01:05:55.537 --> 01:05:58.195
- Let's get the hell outta here.

1001
01:08:15.746 --> 01:08:18.035
So how are you feeling?

1002
01:08:18.059 --> 01:08:20.071
Tiger dumped you in the ocean.

1003
01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:21.970
You were in a coma.

1004
01:08:21.994 --> 01:08:26.999
Have you healed spiritually.
emotionally. physically?

1005
01:08:29.415 --> 01:08:32.704
- Yeah. I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

1006
01:08:32.728 --> 01:08:37.734
After weeks of training.
re-centering myself.

1007
01:08:39.805 --> 01:08:44.015
building my body back
up. my mind and spirit.

1008
01:08:45.259 --> 01:08:47.513
I think we're ready
to go back to LA.

1009
01:08:47.537 --> 01:08:51.413
take down the Hollywood
mob. the Lunada Bay Gang.

1010
01:08:51.437 --> 01:08:52.541
and the Triads.

1011
01:08:54.785 --> 01:08:57.236
- So how do you wanna
accomplish this mission?

1012
01:08:58.824 --> 01:09:03.529
- The shotgun approach.
we go in. take 'em out.

1013
01:09:03.553 --> 01:09:05.116
It's either us or the feds.

1014
01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:07.636
If the feds take over.
they're gonna destroy

1015
01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:10.467
all of our hard
work. Lex will walk.

1016
01:09:10.491 --> 01:09:13.078
and Tiger will just continue
to run the syndicate.

1017
01:09:15.081 --> 01:09:16.437
It's you and me.

1018
01:09:16.461 --> 01:09:18.991
- Do you think
that we're enough?

1019
01:09:19.015 --> 01:09:21.580
Don't you think we
should have some backup?

1020
01:09:21.604 --> 01:09:23.710
- I'm a trained Navy Seal.

1021
01:09:25.022 --> 01:09:29.786
I fought against
terrorists in Afghanistan.

1022
01:09:31.443 --> 01:09:33.548
I fought against the
Taliban and Al-Qaeda.

1023
01:09:34.479 --> 01:09:35.688
I'm fully trained.

1024
01:09:36.758 --> 01:09:39.772
I'm angry. I'm hungry.

1025
01:09:39.796 --> 01:09:41.728
and I'm trained to
complete my mission.

1026
01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:46.182
They will rule the day they
messed with this Navy Seal.

1027
01:09:48.011 --> 01:09:50.300
- Okay. well. I'm gonna
trust your judgment on this

1028
01:09:50.324 --> 01:09:52.049
when we go tomorrow
like you said.

1029
01:09:53.258 --> 01:09:54.258
- You should.

1030
01:09:56.053 --> 01:09:57.745
- Great.
- Great.

1031
01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:02.174
You look very
pretty. by the way.

1032
01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:03.785
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1033
01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:11.631
- Knock. knock.

1034
01:10:11.655 --> 01:10:15.151
- Dalton. you should be at
the bottom of the ocean. dead.

1035
01:10:15.175 --> 01:10:16.636
locals only.

1036
01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:19.191
- I was trained not to die
and to complete my mission.

1037
01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:22.332
Kiley Hall was a young.
beautiful woman who just wanted

1038
01:10:22.356 --> 01:10:24.886
to preserve the historic surf
club her grandfather started

1039
01:10:24.910 --> 01:10:28.130
in the 1930s. until a
trust fund piece of garbage

1040
01:10:28.154 --> 01:10:30.374
like you took over
and corrupted it.

1041
01:10:30.398 --> 01:10:32.031
You took her life from her.

1042
01:10:32.055 --> 01:10:33.469
Now I'm gonna take your life.

1043
01:10:35.921 --> 01:10:37.174
- Gonna arrest me. bro. or what?

1044
01:10:37.198 --> 01:10:39.556
- I take it you're not
gonna come in quietly.

1045
01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:41.074
- Not a chance.

1046
01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:49.290
- I'm the ghost
of Christmas past.

1047
01:10:49.314 --> 01:10:51.212
and your past just
caught up with you.

1048
01:11:00.566 --> 01:11:05.226
Hey. Bolo. your days of
selling Galaxy is over.

1049
01:11:08.746 --> 01:11:09.746
- Oh yeah?

1050
01:11:12.647 --> 01:11:15.074
So you're the detective
who killed my father?

1051
01:11:15.098 --> 01:11:16.558
- Yeah. that's right.

1052
01:11:16.582 --> 01:11:19.251
You should'a heard him squeal
when I shot him in the head.

1053
01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:21.356
- Now I'm gonna
avenge his death.

1054
01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:22.485
- Love to see you try.

1055
01:11:52.446 --> 01:11:53.930
You're done. Tang.

1056
01:12:05.528 --> 01:12:07.575
Hey. I know that guy.

1057
01:12:07.599 --> 01:12:09.117
We're old friends.

1058
01:12:10.291 --> 01:12:12.155
I'm gonna take care of
this guy real quick.

1059
01:12:14.675 --> 01:12:16.894
Hey. Misfit. long time. no see.

1060
01:12:16.918 --> 01:12:18.137
- You again.

1061
01:12:18.161 --> 01:12:20.311
- Yep. I see your
face is still ugly.

1062
01:12:20.335 --> 01:12:22.096
but your forehead
healed up nicely.

1063
01:12:23.511 --> 01:12:24.960
- Welcome to my playground.

1064
01:12:45.326 --> 01:12:48.985
- Now you swing with
your invisible friends.

1065
01:12:56.371 --> 01:12:57.371
- Dalton.

1066
01:12:59.719 --> 01:13:02.181
- KV. I see you're walking
around with a cane now.

1067
01:13:02.205 --> 01:13:04.390
- Yeah. thanks to you
and physical therapy.

1068
01:13:04.414 --> 01:13:05.450
I get a cane now.

1069
01:13:06.692 --> 01:13:08.532
- You're welcome.

1070
01:13:08.556 --> 01:13:10.258
- Well. shall we do this?

1071
01:13:10.282 --> 01:13:11.282
- Why not?

1072
01:13:35.134 --> 01:13:37.249
Make sure he stays down.

1073
01:13:37.273 --> 01:13:38.344
I'm going up.

1074
01:13:54.982 --> 01:13:57.719
- There he is.

1075
01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:34.746
- Stay down.

1076
01:14:38.646 --> 01:14:39.865
- What are you doing here?

1077
01:14:39.889 --> 01:14:41.694
I thought we dumped
you in the ocean?

1078
01:14:41.718 --> 01:14:42.524
- I'm back from the dead.

1079
01:14:42.548 --> 01:14:44.007
Miss me?

1080
01:14:44.031 --> 01:14:45.111
- I'll tell you what. I'm gonna
give you a fighting chance.

1081
01:14:45.135 --> 01:14:46.135
Weapon up.

1082
01:14:48.518 --> 01:14:49.864
- It's your a funeral. pal.

1083
01:14:51.072 --> 01:14:52.072
This will work.

1084
01:15:19.514 --> 01:15:21.526
I don't like your ponytail.

1085
01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:26.014
You look too much like.
I don't know. a horse.

1086
01:15:26.038 --> 01:15:28.292
I'm gonna cut it off.
and I'm gonna slap you

1087
01:15:28.316 --> 01:15:29.604
in your face with him.

1088
01:15:29.628 --> 01:15:32.976
- All right. let's
see how good you are.

1089
01:16:28.618 --> 01:16:30.240
- Come on. get him.

1090
01:16:51.089 --> 01:16:53.204
- Time for a bedtime story.

1091
01:16:53.228 --> 01:16:54.481
- You scumbag.

1092
01:16:54.505 --> 01:16:57.692
- You're coming with me!
- No I'm not!

1093
01:16:57.716 --> 01:16:59.176
- Akeem.

1094
01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:00.695
- Are you ready
for this. playboy?

1095
01:17:00.719 --> 01:17:02.248
Is that all you got?

1096
01:17:02.272 --> 01:17:05.585
- Yeah. I'm ready. but then
I have to go get breakfast.

1097
01:17:06.794 --> 01:17:08.772
- Let's see what you got.

1098
01:17:08.796 --> 01:17:09.796
Bring it.

1099
01:17:16.493 --> 01:17:18.323
- All right. let's go.

1100
01:17:41.070 --> 01:17:43.416
That's how you want to play?

1101
01:17:50.735 --> 01:17:51.977
Let's end this.

1102
01:18:06.958 --> 01:18:07.959
- Let me go.

1103
01:18:14.172 --> 01:18:16.830
- This fight just ended. Prasad!

1104
01:18:19.522 --> 01:18:21.455
- Come with me. Barbie.

1105
01:18:22.282 --> 01:18:23.768
- Dalton. help me!

1106
01:18:28.427 --> 01:18:29.888
- Careful. Dalton.

1107
01:18:29.912 --> 01:18:31.544
You're getting way too close.
and you don't want anything

1108
01:18:31.568 --> 01:18:33.201
to happen to her. do you?

1109
01:18:33.225 --> 01:18:34.513
- Let her go. Tiger.

1110
01:18:34.537 --> 01:18:36.515
It's me you want.

1111
01:18:36.539 --> 01:18:38.413
Come on. Tiger.

1112
01:18:38.437 --> 01:18:39.967
Get father's revenge.

1113
01:18:39.991 --> 01:18:41.337
- Suck my balls!

1114
01:18:44.409 --> 01:18:45.869
- Suck what?

1115
01:18:45.893 --> 01:18:47.526
It's called a drop kicking.

1116
01:18:47.550 --> 01:18:49.528
I learned that in second grade.

1117
01:19:00.736 --> 01:19:04.405
- Dalton. I need your help.

1118
01:19:08.813 --> 01:19:11.377
- Dalton. snap out of it!

1119
01:19:16.475 --> 01:19:20.410
I gotta stop freezing at
with these flashbacks.

1120
01:19:36.702 --> 01:19:38.094
- Even if you kill me.

1121
01:19:38.118 --> 01:19:40.475
there's more of our
family to come after you!

1122
01:19:40.499 --> 01:19:42.684
- Yeah. and I'm
the Easter bunny.

1123
01:19:42.708 --> 01:19:46.171
What's father's saying. try
me or die like the rest?

1124
01:19:46.195 --> 01:19:50.865
Well. you're not with
me. so you die!

1125
01:19:50.889 --> 01:19:52.097
Now I'm the only child.

1126
01:20:02.038 --> 01:20:05.707
- This time. I will
avenge my parents' death.

1127
01:20:05.731 --> 01:20:07.570
- Not on my watch.

1128
01:20:17.053 --> 01:20:18.444
- I finish what I start too.

1129
01:20:21.644 --> 01:20:23.415
I told them which
one of those stations

1130
01:20:23.439 --> 01:20:25.486
that they were parked
at over the years.

1131
01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:30.514
Manage a guess. and they was
killed by me like I wanted.

1132
01:20:31.896 --> 01:20:34.933
but I can still avenge my
parents murder by killing you.

1133
01:20:36.038 --> 01:20:38.454
- Oh. yeah?

1134
01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:43.745
If all you care about
is getting a revenge.

1135
01:20:43.769 --> 01:20:47.187
then you're no better than my
father or his syndicate was.

1136
01:20:48.809 --> 01:20:51.847
At least my father had
redemption in the end.

1137
01:20:59.130 --> 01:21:01.407
- You're right. I'm
sorry. I'm sorry.

1138
01:21:03.996 --> 01:21:05.136
- Let it go. Jake!

1139
01:21:06.171 --> 01:21:07.171
Let it go.

1140
01:21:08.346 --> 01:21:09.346
Let it die.

1141
01:21:32.611 --> 01:21:33.992
I said let it go!

1142
01:21:49.870 --> 01:21:51.952
Shouldn't you get in
on the passenger side?

1143
01:21:51.976 --> 01:21:53.436
- You're cute.

1144
01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:54.460
Get in.

1145
01:22:01.226 --> 01:22:02.651
So where do you wanna go next?

1146
01:22:02.675 --> 01:22:04.274
Do you wanna go to the hospital?

1147
01:22:04.298 --> 01:22:08.577
- Yeah. hospital. and then
we go on our first date.

1148
01:22:10.373 --> 01:22:12.134
- Sounds like a plan.

1149
01:22:17.277 --> 01:22:19.600
- You have the right
to remain silent.

1150
01:22:19.624 --> 01:22:21.395
Anything you say can and
will be held against you

1151
01:22:21.419 --> 01:22:22.775
in a court of law.

1152
01:22:22.799 --> 01:22:23.880
You have the right
to an attorney.

1153
01:22:23.904 --> 01:22:25.468
If you can't afford an attorney.

1154
01:22:25.492 --> 01:22:27.090
one will be appointed for you.

1155
01:22:27.114 --> 01:22:29.265
Do you understand?

1156
01:22:32.257 --> 01:22:34.432
- Hey. pop. how you doing?

1157
01:22:35.951 --> 01:22:38.999
- Well. I did it.

1158
01:22:39.023 --> 01:22:41.197
I completed my mission.

1159
01:22:44.338 --> 01:22:46.858
I took down the
Hollywood mob once again.

1160
01:22:48.446 --> 01:22:51.690
and this time. a bunch
of surfing gang members.

1161
01:22:53.037 --> 01:22:54.037
I did good.

1162
01:22:57.179 --> 01:23:02.080
I just want to stop by and
pay my respects to you.

1163
01:23:02.978 --> 01:23:04.138
tell you how much I love you.

1164
01:23:06.291 --> 01:23:09.294
tell you how much
I think about you.

1165
01:23:11.675 --> 01:23:12.675
I miss you.

1166
01:23:21.962 --> 01:23:23.860
The coroner found
this in your pocket.

1167
01:23:26.035 --> 01:23:29.210
It's your gambling chips.

1168
01:23:30.728 --> 01:23:32.731
I see you went to
Vegas before you died.

1169
01:23:35.079 --> 01:23:37.805
and I found some beer chips.

1170
01:23:39.014 --> 01:23:40.574
I know you liked your
Miller Light beer.

1171
01:23:47.022 --> 01:23:49.507
I thought you'd like 'em back.

1172
01:24:04.798 --> 01:24:06.431
I love you. pop.

1173
01:24:06.455 --> 01:24:07.455
I miss you.

1174
01:24:21.677 --> 01:24:26.577
Pop. what are you doing here?

1175
01:24:28.132 --> 01:24:33.137
- I came back to tell you I'm
proud of you. and I love you.

1176
01:24:35.932 --> 01:24:37.106
and I'm doing okay.

1177
01:24:40.144 --> 01:24:42.491
- I been waiting a
long time to hear that.

1178
01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:45.839
You look great.

1179
01:24:46.978 --> 01:24:49.187
Just you look just
like when I was a kid.

1180
01:24:53.191 --> 01:24:57.057
- You're a good kid.
and you're a good man.

1181
01:25:01.406 --> 01:25:03.660
- This is my favorite
memory of us playing.

1182
01:25:03.684 --> 01:25:06.066
kicking the orange
soccer ball around.

1183
01:25:09.414 --> 01:25:10.414
- Mine too.

1184
01:25:18.216 --> 01:25:22.369
- I'm glad to see
you again. pop.

1185
01:25:22.393 --> 01:25:23.393
I miss you.

1186
01:25:24.602 --> 01:25:26.362
- I wanted a little
more time with you.

1187
01:25:27.743 --> 01:25:29.434
- I'll keep making
you proud. pop.

1188
01:25:31.471 --> 01:25:32.782
- Stay on the right track.

1189
01:25:35.612 --> 01:25:36.924
Do it for yourself.

1190
01:25:37.787 --> 01:25:38.787
- I love you. pop.

1191
01:25:40.342 --> 01:25:41.342
- I love you. son.
