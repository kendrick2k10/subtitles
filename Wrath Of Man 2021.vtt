00:01:41.144 --> 00:01:44.234

We're not federal.

108

We're essentially middlemen.

109
00:06:22.686 --> 00:06:25.385
Hundreds of millions shifting
through here every week.

110
00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:27.735
We got 12 trucks.
two or three guards in each.

111
00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:29.998
A driver. a messenger.
and a guard.

112
00:06:30.172 --> 00:06:33.262
each moving up to 15 mil
a day. and sometimes more.

113
00:06:33.436 --> 00:06:35.743
which can attract
unwanted attention.

114
00:06:35.917 --> 00:06:38.049
I won't lie.
It can be dangerous.

115
00:06:38.223 --> 00:06:39.616
which is why
we train you properly

116
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.618
and pay the premium rates.

117
00:06:41.792 --> 00:06:43.533
so we can all
sleep better at night.

118
00:06:43.707 --> 00:06:45.143
Thanks.

119
00:06:45.317 --> 00:06:46.710
Now. your background checks
came back fine.

120
00:06:46.884 --> 00:06:48.190
and your reference from

121
00:06:48.364 --> 00:06:49.713
Orange Delta Security
was impressive.

122
00:06:49.887 --> 00:06:51.323
That was a good company.

123
00:06:51.498 --> 00:06:53.369
I'm sorry to hear
it went bust.

124
00:06:53.674 --> 00:06:54.588
Family?

125
00:06:54.762 --> 00:06:56.720
Married. Divorced.

126
00:06:56.894 --> 00:06:57.982
No one else?

127
00:06:58.722 --> 00:06:59.723
No.

128
00:07:00.724 --> 00:07:03.335
Good. Stay focused. I like it.

129
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.120
But just so you know.

130
00:07:05.294 --> 00:07:07.862
we lost a couple of guards
a while back.

131
00:07:08.036 --> 00:07:10.168
Killed on the job.
A civilian. too.

132
00:07:11.213 --> 00:07:12.910
A fuckin' tragedy.

133
00:07:13.084 --> 00:07:15.696
and they still haven't found
the scum who did it.

134
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.349
And that's why
we've upped our game.

135
00:07:17.524 --> 00:07:19.177
Sixty hours
of firearms training.

136
00:07:19.351 --> 00:07:22.006
MAN 2: Patrick?
Are you Patrick Hill?

137
00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:24.139
No. please. Don't get up.

00:07:24.313 --> 00:07:25.619
Good to meet you.

139
00:07:25.793 --> 00:07:28.273
Let's see. Hill... Hill...

140
00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:31.668
H. I'm gonna call you H.
if that's okay?

141
00:07:31.842 --> 00:07:34.105
They call me Bullet.
which is ironic

142
00:07:34.279 --> 00:07:36.151
because I certainly
don't move like one.

143
00:07:36.325 --> 00:07:37.282
You ready for target practice?

144
00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:38.849
Ready.

145
00:07:39.023 --> 00:07:41.156
I saw you had
your pistol license already.

146
00:07:41.548 --> 00:07:43.854
So. this is the pre-assignment
training course.

147
00:07:44.028 --> 00:07:45.334
We got eight hours together.

148
00:07:45.508 --> 00:07:47.510
popping cans
off walls and the like.

149
00:07:47.684 --> 00:07:49.947
You need to hit
the 70% pass mark.

150
00:07:50.121 --> 00:07:51.949
There's some fitness
which. by the looks of it.

151
00:07:52.123 --> 00:07:53.647
shouldn't be
a problem for you.

152
00:07:53.821 --> 00:07:55.692
We just need to see
how you are under pressure.

153
00:07:56.258 --> 00:07:57.302
Shall we get started?

154
00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:58.608
Whatever you say. Bullet.

155
00:08:18.062 --> 00:08:19.629
Well. that's
quite enough of that.

156
00:08:33.338 --> 00:08:34.688
Been a while. huh?

157
00:08:35.732 --> 00:08:37.517
Little practice.
I'm sure you'll get there.

158
00:08:49.616 --> 00:08:51.531
Whoa. whoa. whoa!
Too far! Too far!

159
00:08:51.705 --> 00:08:53.837
Pull up a little. Pull it up.

160
00:09:01.018 --> 00:09:02.019
Look at that.

161
00:09:03.064 --> 00:09:04.544
70%.

162
00:09:04.718 --> 00:09:05.980
Just slipped in.

163
00:09:06.154 --> 00:09:08.373
Any less.
we'd be doing this again.

164
00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:11.072
You won't be joining
a Formula 1 team anytime soon.

165
00:09:11.246 --> 00:09:13.378
but you'll do for this job.

166
00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:14.858
Let's get you suited.

167
00:09:16.077 --> 00:09:17.295
How many we got coming?

168
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.429
In that case.
I'll get three pounds of ribs

169
00:09:20.603 --> 00:09:21.735
and a bucket of wings
for the kids.

170
00:09:21.909 --> 00:09:22.910
Cough up. Bullet.

171
00:09:23.084 --> 00:09:24.041
Dude. I'm on the phone.

172
00:09:24.215 --> 00:09:25.477
I don't care. $30.

173
00:09:25.652 --> 00:09:26.740
-How much?
-30 bucks.

174
00:09:26.914 --> 00:09:28.393
Wait for it. wait for it.

175
00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:29.960
-Change?
-Suplex!

176
00:09:30.134 --> 00:09:31.962
-I want that money.
-There you go. buddy.

177
00:09:32.136 --> 00:09:33.790
Give me that dollar dollar.

178
00:09:33.964 --> 00:09:35.531
-WOMAN: Forty-one.
-Incoming. Thank you.

179
00:09:35.705 --> 00:09:37.272
Forty-two's not gonna beat me.

180
00:09:37.446 --> 00:09:39.274
-Fuck off. Dana.
-SHIRLEY: Come on.

181
00:09:39.448 --> 00:09:41.493
You're not supposed to be
in here anyway.

182
00:09:41.668 --> 00:09:43.017
No. I think it's you

183
00:09:43.191 --> 00:09:44.627
who's in the wrong
changing room. Stuart.

184
00:09:44.801 --> 00:09:46.542
SHIRLEY: Come on.
Let's look lively. people.

185
00:09:46.716 --> 00:09:48.631
Chop-chop. Goose.
Show me your money.

186
00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.461
Ladies and gentlemen.
we have a new addition.

187
00:09:52.635 --> 00:09:53.505
DANA: Here you go. Shirley.

188
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.420
May I introduce H.

189
00:09:57.118 --> 00:09:58.293
Oh. she'll do.

190
00:09:58.467 --> 00:10:00.077
Put him down. Dana.

191
00:10:00.251 --> 00:10:02.863
Come on.
I'll show you your locker.

192
00:10:03.037 --> 00:10:04.473
This one's yours.

193
00:10:06.954 --> 00:10:08.346
-You good?
-Yeah.

194
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.348
Why. don't I look it?

195
00:10:10.522 --> 00:10:14.309
No. buddy. you look like
a shrink-wrapped Rolls-Royce.

196
00:10:14.483 --> 00:10:16.790
in contrast to this car crash.

197
00:10:16.964 --> 00:10:20.228
Meet Hollow Bob
and Boy Sweat Dave.

198
00:10:20.402 --> 00:10:22.012
You look like
you could do some pull-ups.

199
00:10:22.186 --> 00:10:24.145
I'll put a 50
on you beatin' Boy Sweat here.

200
00:10:24.406 --> 00:10:26.538
What's the matter with him?
He looks good for it.

201
00:10:26.713 --> 00:10:27.888
Yeah. that's what
Boy Sweat thinks.

202
00:10:28.062 --> 00:10:29.541
but he's also a cock.

203
00:10:29.716 --> 00:10:30.630
Who's a cock?

204
00:10:30.804 --> 00:10:32.370
You're a cock. Dave.

205
00:10:32.544 --> 00:10:34.764
I reckon our man here
could pull yours right off.

206
00:10:34.938 --> 00:10:36.287
He looks like
he could handle a cock.

207
00:10:36.461 --> 00:10:38.072
Yeah. small hands.

208
00:10:38.246 --> 00:10:40.509
Makes me very popular.
and you look good.

209
00:10:41.597 --> 00:10:42.642
What's that?

210
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.124
I said. uh...

211
00:10:48.125 --> 00:10:49.387
I'm sure you'd win.

212
00:10:49.997 --> 00:10:51.563
At what?

213
00:10:51.738 --> 00:10:53.653
The pull-ups.

214
00:10:56.177 --> 00:10:58.179
Oh. charming.

215
00:10:58.353 --> 00:10:59.354
One of yours?

216
00:10:59.528 --> 00:11:00.790
I've been lookin' for him.

217
00:11:00.964 --> 00:11:02.139
I'll put him back
in the collection.

218
00:11:02.313 --> 00:11:03.837
H: Glad I could help.

219
00:11:04.011 --> 00:11:05.229
BULLET: You know.
you're making friends already.

220
00:11:05.403 --> 00:11:07.231
It's worth
getting to know Dave.

221
00:11:07.405 --> 00:11:09.886
He's quite entertaining in
an unintentional kind of way.

222
00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.714
BOB: Yeah.
He once killed a hamster

223
00:11:11.888 --> 00:11:13.237
'cause he squeezed it
too tight.

224
00:11:13.411 --> 00:11:14.499
BULLET: And he can't write

225
00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:15.936
without sticking
his tongue out.

226
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.416
This is
your temporary sidearm.

227
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:19.809
Just till you get your own.

228
00:11:19.983 --> 00:11:21.202
I need you to love it.

229
00:11:21.376 --> 00:11:22.638
-respect it...
-

230
00:11:22.812 --> 00:11:24.074
...and bring it back
in one piece.

231
00:11:24.248 --> 00:11:26.076
Do they want us back
in one piece. too?

232
00:11:26.642 --> 00:11:27.687
Do you have a problem?

233
00:11:27.861 --> 00:11:29.950
I don't know. Do I?

234
00:11:30.124 --> 00:11:31.429
What happens
if we're pullin' pistols

235
00:11:31.603 --> 00:11:33.170
in a machine gun fight?

236
00:11:33.344 --> 00:11:36.043
Then you retort with
a positive mental attitude.

237
00:11:36.957 --> 00:11:38.698
-Name?
-He's H.

238
00:11:39.394 --> 00:11:40.525
H?

239
00:11:41.526 --> 00:11:44.704
Like the bomb.
or like Jesus H.

240
00:11:46.314 --> 00:11:48.751
Well. if you can mushroom
cloud or walk on water.

241
00:11:48.925 --> 00:11:50.840
what you worried
about machine guns for?

242
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.280
BULLET: It's the rock star's
first day.

243
00:11:56.454 --> 00:11:58.718
All right. lucky you got
a soft drop. then.

244
00:11:58.892 --> 00:12:00.197
Try to keep
your piece strapped.

245
00:12:00.371 --> 00:12:01.851
like he shoulda done
on prom night.

246
00:12:02.286 --> 00:12:03.592
You're just unhappy I'm happy.

247
00:12:03.766 --> 00:12:05.072
Yeah. only man I know

248
00:12:05.246 --> 00:12:06.813
that married
the first woman he banged.

249
00:12:06.987 --> 00:12:08.510
You're a cynical old dog.
Supe.

250
00:12:08.684 --> 00:12:10.817
SUPER: But I still got
plenty of bitches.

251
00:12:10.991 --> 00:12:12.079
'Course he does.

252
00:12:21.349 --> 00:12:22.742
Well. that's nice.

253
00:12:22.916 --> 00:12:24.134
Who's your pal?

254
00:12:24.308 --> 00:12:25.614
I'll explain later.

255
00:12:29.009 --> 00:12:31.533
DANA: Jesus Christ. at least
try to look busy. Shirley.

256
00:12:31.707 --> 00:12:33.187
SHIRLEY: What. you got another
hot date tonight. Dana?

257
00:12:33.361 --> 00:12:35.624
You're gonna love
who your new partner is.

258
00:12:35.798 --> 00:12:37.147
Just tell me
it ain't the Limey.

259
00:12:37.321 --> 00:12:38.932
STUART:
The grand ol' duke himself.

260
00:12:39.106 --> 00:12:40.107
Fuck!

261
00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:43.153
Boy Sweat.
you'll be happy to hear

262
00:12:43.327 --> 00:12:45.068
that H
is replacing Sticky John.

263
00:12:45.242 --> 00:12:46.983
-Thank you. Stuart.
-You got it. Bullet.

264
00:12:47.157 --> 00:12:49.899
Stay out from under my feet.
and we'll get along just fine.

265
00:12:50.073 --> 00:12:52.728
Do you have any idea
how dangerous this job can be?

266
00:12:52.902 --> 00:12:53.947
Some idea. yeah.

267
00:12:54.121 --> 00:12:56.253
No. you have no idea.

268
00:12:56.427 --> 00:12:59.648
We ain't the predators.
we're the prey.

269
00:13:03.043 --> 00:13:04.305
Ooh.

270
00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:06.829
Boy Sweat's up front.
You jump in there with him.

271
00:13:07.003 --> 00:13:08.091
Whatever you say. boss.

272
00:13:17.579 --> 00:13:19.059
DAVE: Did you hear about
the guards that were murdered?

273
00:13:19.233 --> 00:13:20.408
You know.
it happened right down there.

274
00:13:20.582 --> 00:13:22.105
Come on. Dave.
it's his first day.

275
00:13:22.279 --> 00:13:23.803
What? He needs to hear this.

276
00:13:23.977 --> 00:13:26.327
Don't engage. He'll forget
what he said in a moment.

277
00:13:27.023 --> 00:13:28.546
I heard.

278
00:13:29.591 --> 00:13:31.071
It's a tragedy.

279
00:13:32.072 --> 00:13:33.725
Yeah. what you didn't hear

280
00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.815
is that I was meant to be
driving the truck that day.

281
00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:40.210
Why wasn't ya?

282
00:13:40.384 --> 00:13:41.429
I was sick.

283
00:13:41.603 --> 00:13:42.604
BULLET: Hungover.

284
00:13:43.213 --> 00:13:45.607
Sick. All holes.

285
00:13:45.781 --> 00:13:47.609
And the last thing I needed
was the Feds in my face

286
00:13:47.783 --> 00:13:49.741
trying to make out
if I was involved somehow.

287
00:13:49.916 --> 00:13:51.656
Lucky you had a strong alibi.

288
00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:53.963
Fuck you. Bullet.

289
00:13:54.137 --> 00:13:55.530
He was staying at his mom's.

290
00:13:56.879 --> 00:13:58.446
She knows how I like my eggs.

291
00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:06.410
BULLET: This is a $2 million
pickup for Bank of the US.

292
00:14:06.584 --> 00:14:09.370
Dave will stay in the truck.
H. you're coming with me.

293
00:14:09.544 --> 00:14:11.981
You get to meet the lovely
ladies who work the tills.

294
00:14:12.155 --> 00:14:13.983
Just be wary of Hot Betty.

295
00:14:14.157 --> 00:14:16.594
If you're lucky. she'll only
take your fuckin' arm off.

296
00:14:19.249 --> 00:14:21.991
Godfrey. H.
H. Godfrey.

297
00:14:22.165 --> 00:14:24.037
-H.
-Godfrey.

298
00:14:24.211 --> 00:14:25.647
X marks the spot.

299
00:14:27.431 --> 00:14:29.869
Godfrey. as always.
a pleasure.

300
00:14:31.392 --> 00:14:33.394
I like the way
you handle that cart.

301
00:14:33.568 --> 00:14:34.961
Where'd you learn
that technique?

302
00:14:35.135 --> 00:14:37.789
H: Spent a lot of time
in supermarkets.

303
00:14:38.094 --> 00:14:39.966
-Shopping.
-

304
00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.881
BULLET: I can picture it now.

305
00:14:42.055 --> 00:14:45.710
A paragon of modern man
on a wild sojourn.

306
00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:50.280
stalking down the aisles.
hunting for Pop-Tarts.

307
00:14:50.454 --> 00:14:53.240
Pop-Tarts are not really
my poison. Bullet.

308
00:14:53.414 --> 00:14:55.851
I prefer to lose myself
in the dizzy food coma

309
00:14:56.025 --> 00:14:59.333
of synthetic cheese
and impossible meats.

310
00:14:59.811 --> 00:15:02.075
BULLET: What has the world
come to?

311
00:15:02.249 --> 00:15:04.468
A direct line of evolution.

312
00:15:04.642 --> 00:15:06.340
from Paleolithic man

313
00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:09.473
to a diabetic house husband.

314
00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:11.954
Harsh.

315
00:15:12.128 --> 00:15:13.347
But true.

316
00:15:17.568 --> 00:15:19.353
How'd your boy do?

317
00:15:19.527 --> 00:15:21.181
Did he survive
the hostile territory

318
00:15:21.355 --> 00:15:23.139
of Hot Betty
and the menopausal MILFs?

319
00:15:23.879 --> 00:15:26.012
Did you make poo-poo.
or is your diaper still clean?

320
00:15:26.186 --> 00:15:27.535
He did just fine.

321
00:15:27.709 --> 00:15:30.103
Hot Betty
almost slid off her seat.

322
00:15:30.277 --> 00:15:32.932
Oh. so there's juice
in the old raisin yet.

323
00:15:47.468 --> 00:15:49.122
Wakey-wakey. Sticky.

324
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.996
2411. clear to proceed.

325
00:16:00.785 --> 00:16:02.962
Pull her in slowly this time.
Boy Sweat.

326
00:16:09.577 --> 00:16:11.274
DAVE: Base.
this is Gamma reporting back.

327
00:16:11.448 --> 00:16:13.407
Copy that. Gamma.

328
00:16:13.581 --> 00:16:15.148
Where's that boyfriend
of yours?

329
00:16:15.844 --> 00:16:18.368
They always gotta see
the driver and messenger.

330
00:16:18.542 --> 00:16:20.240
Otherwise.
you ain't gettin' in.

331
00:16:25.288 --> 00:16:26.811
JOHN: Okay. Gamma.
you're clear.

332
00:16:27.812 --> 00:16:30.032
At least your boy
didn't fuck that up.

333
00:16:30.685 --> 00:16:31.773
I still prefer Sticky John.

334
00:16:31.947 --> 00:16:33.818
Everyone prefers Sticky John.

335
00:16:34.123 --> 00:16:36.082
Mm. you're gonna
love him. Dave.

336
00:16:36.256 --> 00:16:39.172
He's got that exotic European
thing workin' for him.

337
00:16:39.346 --> 00:16:40.869
It'll take you a while
to dial in.

338
00:16:41.043 --> 00:16:42.871
Hasn't taken me very long.

339
00:16:43.045 --> 00:16:44.786
I don't care
what you guys think.

340
00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.049
That man's a dark horse.

341
00:16:47.223 --> 00:16:48.442
What do you mean by that?

342
00:16:48.616 --> 00:16:50.313
That cat's overqualified
for this game.

343
00:16:50.487 --> 00:16:51.967
He's got history.

344
00:16:52.533 --> 00:16:55.144
We're all overqualified
for this game.

345
00:16:55.318 --> 00:16:56.667
and we all got history.

346
00:16:58.974 --> 00:17:00.019
Beer and pool?

347
00:17:00.976 --> 00:17:02.673
Your first day's over.

348
00:17:03.152 --> 00:17:04.458
It's a tradition.

349
00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:07.113
Sure. Give me two minutes.

350
00:17:13.815 --> 00:17:15.730
JOHN: Well. look who it is.
Beauty and the fucking Beast.

351
00:17:15.904 --> 00:17:17.993
BULLET: Ain't you gonna
put your card back. Sticky?

352
00:17:40.189 --> 00:17:41.973
The point of the game is
to get the ball in the hole.

353
00:17:42.148 --> 00:17:44.237
Point of a woman
is to shut the fuck up. Dana.

354
00:17:44.411 --> 00:17:45.673
All that Ivy League education

355
00:17:45.847 --> 00:17:47.544
is really workin' for you.
Boy Sweat.

356
00:17:47.718 --> 00:17:49.198
Pretty soon
you'll all be workin' for me.

357
00:17:49.372 --> 00:17:50.895
The power's
in this big head here.

358
00:17:51.418 --> 00:17:52.897
Well. it's definitely not
in your little head.

359
00:17:53.072 --> 00:17:54.421
or are you
still blaming the beer?

360
00:17:55.944 --> 00:17:58.512
Yo. Jap's eye. you gonna
take a shot. or what?

361
00:17:58.686 --> 00:18:00.949
At least I'll still be here
next week to take a shot.

362
00:18:01.558 --> 00:18:02.994
What's that supposed
to fuckin' mean?

363
00:18:03.169 --> 00:18:04.909
He's already got your old job.

364
00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:08.391
Word around the pool table is
boss has eyes for the new boy.

365
00:18:08.565 --> 00:18:11.438
What. flat-footed Limey?
I'd shit him.

366
00:18:11.612 --> 00:18:13.135
Maybe you should
say that to his face.

367
00:18:13.309 --> 00:18:14.615
Maybe I will.

368
00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:17.879
I spy with my little eye
that I smell fear.

369
00:18:18.053 --> 00:18:19.620
That doesn't make any sense.

370
00:18:20.186 --> 00:18:21.187
Hey. John.

371
00:18:22.362 --> 00:18:23.580
You're an idiot.

372
00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:26.975
JOHN: Fuckin' assholes.

373
00:18:27.149 --> 00:18:28.890
Here comes the walk of shame.

374
00:18:29.456 --> 00:18:30.718
JOHN: Yo. Action Man.

375
00:18:30.892 --> 00:18:32.937
can I buy you a beer?

376
00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:34.287
Nah.

377
00:18:37.812 --> 00:18:38.943
Sorry. uh...

378
00:18:39.944 --> 00:18:41.555
You mind?

379
00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:50.738
So. uh. where'd
you work before. then?

380
00:18:51.434 --> 00:18:55.743
Orange Delta Security. Europe.

381
00:18:56.526 --> 00:18:58.267
Jolly excitin'. was it. mate?

382
00:19:02.532 --> 00:19:04.621
Yeah. spectacular.

383
00:19:07.363 --> 00:19:09.496
You ain't much for talking.
are ya. Mary Poppins?

384
00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:11.193
Oh. no. I can talk.

385
00:19:11.367 --> 00:19:13.456
I just don't want
to talk to you.

386
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:15.197
Let me buy you a beer.

387
00:19:15.719 --> 00:19:17.852
Just make sure
you drink it over there.

388
00:19:29.907 --> 00:19:30.908
Anything else?

389
00:19:39.439 --> 00:19:41.484
BULLET:
I gotta give it to ya. H.

390
00:19:41.702 --> 00:19:43.791
You're a real social magician.

391
00:19:44.835 --> 00:19:46.881
First. you take his job.

392
00:19:47.708 --> 00:19:50.276
and then you make him cry
in his beer.

393
00:20:12.428 --> 00:20:13.690
DAVE: What is
taking him so long?

394
00:20:14.125 --> 00:20:15.431
It's a 10-grand drop.

395
00:20:15.605 --> 00:20:16.824
He should have been back
five minutes ago.

396
00:20:20.828 --> 00:20:22.656
Hey. Bullet.
what's taking you so long?

397
00:20:27.574 --> 00:20:29.140
Bullet. unless you found

398
00:20:29.315 --> 00:20:30.925
some beautiful.
blue-eyed Latino boy.

399
00:20:31.099 --> 00:20:32.448
you should be back by now.

400
00:20:38.411 --> 00:20:39.455
BULLET: Fuck. fuck!

401
00:20:41.631 --> 00:20:42.980
ROBBER:
You fucking look at me...

402
00:20:43.154 --> 00:20:44.678
You see me.
and you fucking die!

403
00:20:51.511 --> 00:20:52.990
Dave...

404
00:20:53.208 --> 00:20:54.818
ROBBER 2: We're gonna
fucking kill him.

405
00:20:58.648 --> 00:21:00.607
Now. listen to me. ladies.

406
00:21:00.781 --> 00:21:02.783
If you wanna see
your girlfriend again.

407
00:21:02.957 --> 00:21:04.741
you'll do exactly as I say.

408
00:21:07.004 --> 00:21:08.136
DAVE: Uh...

409
00:21:10.617 --> 00:21:12.706
I have to call this...
No! Uh...

410
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.273
There's a protocol for this.
We have to drive away.

411
00:21:14.447 --> 00:21:16.405
-We just drive away.
-Sorry?

412
00:21:16.884 --> 00:21:18.929
They don't want his 10 grand.
They don't want his 10 grand.

413
00:21:19.103 --> 00:21:20.931
The money's in the truck.
We have $2.5 million in here.

414
00:21:21.105 --> 00:21:22.455
If we take it away.
they're not gonna hurt him.

415
00:21:22.629 --> 00:21:23.586
They're not gonna kill him
for 10 grand.

416
00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.153
Dave.

417
00:21:25.849 --> 00:21:27.286
you need to
pull yourself together.

418
00:21:27.764 --> 00:21:29.113
You need to reconsider this.

419
00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:30.637
Reconsider?

420
00:21:30.811 --> 00:21:32.116
That's why they have
the fucking policy!

421
00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:33.422
You don't wanna do this.

422
00:21:33.596 --> 00:21:34.815
you can get out
of the truck now.

423
00:21:36.382 --> 00:21:37.034
But we're not
leaving him behind.

424
00:21:37.208 --> 00:21:38.340
He's one of us.

425
00:21:38.514 --> 00:21:40.211
It's only money.

426
00:21:40.995 --> 00:21:42.170
In short.

427
00:21:42.823 --> 00:21:44.477
I'm getting him back.

428
00:21:45.739 --> 00:21:47.741
Stop fucking around.

429
00:21:47.915 --> 00:21:50.831
You have one minute
before she dies.

430
00:21:51.614 --> 00:21:54.661
Now. turn the key and drive.

431
00:21:54.835 --> 00:21:57.968
and I will tell you
when to stop.

432
00:21:58.317 --> 00:22:00.449
You gonna drive.
or you getting out?

433
00:22:00.928 --> 00:22:02.625
Oh. shit.

434
00:22:02.799 --> 00:22:05.324
This is such a bad idea.

435
00:22:18.685 --> 00:22:20.817
Take the next left.

436
00:22:37.834 --> 00:22:40.271
Now. stop the truck.

437
00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.805
-BULLET: All right. All right.

438
00:22:52.501 --> 00:22:54.068
ROBBER: Get the fuck
over here.

439
00:22:54.416 --> 00:22:55.896
ROBBER 3: We got
your fucking friend.

440
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:57.550
He don't mean shit to us.

441
00:22:57.854 --> 00:22:58.812
They're serious!

442
00:22:58.986 --> 00:23:00.074
-

443
00:23:00.248 --> 00:23:01.554
ROBBER: Shut the fuck up.

444
00:23:01.728 --> 00:23:04.339
ROBBER 3:
Open the fucking doors.

445
00:23:04.513 --> 00:23:07.647
and pick up the money.
and throw it in the flatbed.

446
00:23:07.821 --> 00:23:09.257
You open it. they're just
gonna kill all three of us

447
00:23:09.431 --> 00:23:11.172
and take the money anyway.

448
00:23:11.781 --> 00:23:13.217
Dave. you just worry about

449
00:23:13.392 --> 00:23:14.915
putting your arsehole
back in your arsehole.

450
00:23:15.089 --> 00:23:16.960
and leave this to me.

451
00:23:17.613 --> 00:23:18.614
Fuck!

452
00:23:36.502 --> 00:23:38.068
Fuck!

453
00:23:38.242 --> 00:23:39.722
ROBBER 1: This guy's fucking
around. He's throwing

454
00:23:39.896 --> 00:23:40.767
-bags on the floor.
-God fucking damn it.

455
00:23:40.941 --> 00:23:42.246
Now. listen up. fuckboy.

456
00:23:42.421 --> 00:23:45.032
I said throw the money
in the fucking flatbed.

457
00:23:45.206 --> 00:23:46.686
Try to get clever again.

458
00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.166
and old boy's getting
a face full of shit.

459
00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:50.341
Now. aim fucking straight!

460
00:23:50.516 --> 00:23:51.647
Just do what he says.

461
00:23:51.821 --> 00:23:53.562
These guys
are fucking serious.

462
00:23:59.046 --> 00:24:00.569
ROBBER 1: Get it in the truck
next time. you fucknut!

463
00:24:00.961 --> 00:24:02.310
Sorry. pal.

464
00:24:04.181 --> 00:24:05.182
Oh. fuck!

465
00:24:09.056 --> 00:24:10.274
Fuck!

466
00:24:10.449 --> 00:24:11.362
DAVE: Please!
Put the gun down!

467
00:24:11.537 --> 00:24:12.755
Just let them take the money!

468
00:24:12.929 --> 00:24:13.756
You're gonna
get us fucking killed.

469
00:24:15.192 --> 00:24:16.542
ROBBER 1: Fuck. go. move!

470
00:24:17.064 --> 00:24:18.239
DAVE: Please stop!

471
00:24:18.413 --> 00:24:19.849
Just give 'em
the fucking money!

472
00:24:20.023 --> 00:24:21.634
Are you fucking insane?

473
00:24:24.506 --> 00:24:26.116
DAVE: Fuck! Fuck!

474
00:24:40.609 --> 00:24:42.350
Bullet! Bullet!

475
00:24:42.524 --> 00:24:44.178
Who is this fucking lunatic?

476
00:24:45.571 --> 00:24:47.529
-

477
00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:58.453
-

478
00:25:05.939 --> 00:25:07.810
-Ahh! Fuck!

479
00:25:10.596 --> 00:25:11.640
Jesus Christ.

480
00:25:12.511 --> 00:25:13.642
Who do you work for?

481
00:25:14.208 --> 00:25:16.384
Suck my fucking dick!

482
00:25:17.037 --> 00:25:18.081
What did you say?

483
00:25:19.256 --> 00:25:21.781
I said suck my fucking dick!

484
00:25:21.955 --> 00:25:23.217
Suck your own dick.

485
00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.795
You all right. Dave?

486
00:25:37.884 --> 00:25:39.538
Did you make poo-poo?

487
00:25:57.294 --> 00:25:58.513
Thank you for that.

488
00:26:04.606 --> 00:26:06.390
Last but not least. Mr. Hill.

489
00:26:06.565 --> 00:26:08.567
OKEY: Well. you're all
sticking to the same story.

490
00:26:08.741 --> 00:26:10.569
That's what happened.

491
00:26:11.439 --> 00:26:12.745
What I don't understand

492
00:26:12.919 --> 00:26:14.181
is how you managed
to take down six men

493
00:26:14.355 --> 00:26:15.835
without even so much
as a scratch.

494
00:26:16.009 --> 00:26:17.619
Well. you gotta admit
it's impressive.

495
00:26:17.793 --> 00:26:19.403
He saved his partner's life.

496
00:26:20.361 --> 00:26:22.145
What about
your firearms experience?

497
00:26:22.319 --> 00:26:25.584
Your shooting was
unambiguously precise. yet

498
00:26:26.585 --> 00:26:29.152
your training scores
were decidedly average.

499
00:26:29.675 --> 00:26:31.285
Barely even passed.

500
00:26:32.765 --> 00:26:34.767
Kill or be killed.

501
00:26:36.638 --> 00:26:38.422
Seemed to focus the mind.

502
00:26:42.339 --> 00:26:44.646
Well. there's something else.

503
00:26:46.126 --> 00:26:48.258
We'd like you
to take a look at this video.

504
00:26:48.432 --> 00:26:49.825
It's the security footage

505
00:26:49.999 --> 00:26:52.132
from the raid on
the Fortico cash truck before.

506
00:26:52.306 --> 00:26:53.829
When the guards were killed.

507
00:26:54.003 --> 00:26:55.396
Uh. I can't watch this again.

508
00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:57.354
OKEY: Step outside.
by all means.

509
00:26:59.052 --> 00:27:00.793
We just want
you to let us know

510
00:27:00.967 --> 00:27:02.316
if you think
there's any connection

511
00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:03.752
between this robbery

512
00:27:03.926 --> 00:27:05.624
and the men
you encountered before.

513
00:27:16.417 --> 00:27:18.593
You. uh... You all right
to keep watching?

514
00:27:19.638 --> 00:27:22.597
Yeah. I'm all right.

515
00:27:27.776 --> 00:27:28.864
Mr. Hill?

516
00:27:29.473 --> 00:27:30.779
Anything ringing a bell?

517
00:27:35.305 --> 00:27:36.437
Mr. Hill?

518
00:27:37.873 --> 00:27:40.136
Could they be related
in any way?

519
00:27:43.052 --> 00:27:44.227
-Any connection. Mr. Hill?

520
00:27:44.401 --> 00:27:45.794
No.

521
00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:48.144
OKEY: You sure?

522
00:27:50.277 --> 00:27:51.278
I'm sure.

523
00:27:54.281 --> 00:27:55.412
OKEY: All right. Mr. Hill.

524
00:27:55.586 --> 00:27:57.110
we'll pick this up
another day.

525
00:28:00.461 --> 00:28:01.462
Are we done?

526
00:28:01.636 --> 00:28:02.985
Yeah. we'll be in touch.

527
00:28:03.725 --> 00:28:06.685
Visit the therapist. Rest up.

528
00:28:08.338 --> 00:28:09.862
Thank you. Mr. Hill.

529
00:28:15.389 --> 00:28:17.043
Patrick. can I have a word?

530
00:28:18.087 --> 00:28:19.698
We have a policy.

531
00:28:19.872 --> 00:28:21.525
The shrinks advise

532
00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.876
that employees be taken off
the front line for a month

533
00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:25.660
following violent incidents.

534
00:28:25.834 --> 00:28:28.271
and longer if lives were lost.

535
00:28:28.445 --> 00:28:31.100
So. we're gonna
transfer you to desk duty.

536
00:28:31.274 --> 00:28:32.667
in case of PTSD.

537
00:28:32.841 --> 00:28:34.060
Do I look disturbed?

538
00:28:34.234 --> 00:28:35.670
No. No. you don't.

539
00:28:35.844 --> 00:28:38.281
But then. these things
take time to manifest.

540
00:28:38.455 --> 00:28:39.848
to percolate.

541
00:28:40.022 --> 00:28:41.937
It's with your best interests
at heart.

542
00:28:42.111 --> 00:28:44.766
You hired me to do a job.
Did a job.

543
00:28:45.724 --> 00:28:47.464
No. we hired you
to move money.

544
00:28:47.638 --> 00:28:48.770
You hired me to protect money.

545
00:28:48.944 --> 00:28:50.467
MAN: Mr. Hill.

546
00:28:51.599 --> 00:28:54.558
Hey. I'm Blake Halls.
I own Fortico.

547
00:28:54.733 --> 00:28:56.343
I wanted to congratulate you
for yesterday

548
00:28:56.517 --> 00:28:58.040
and to thank you in person.

549
00:28:58.214 --> 00:29:00.260
What you did deserves credit.

550
00:29:00.434 --> 00:29:02.131
You're a real hero.

551
00:29:02.305 --> 00:29:04.743
and that's not wasted on me.

552
00:29:04.917 --> 00:29:06.440
Why don't you take
the rest of the day off

553
00:29:06.614 --> 00:29:09.486
while Terry and I
discuss your promising future?

554
00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:15.797
Terry. we need that guy
in the field.

555
00:29:15.971 --> 00:29:18.495
If we'd had him last year.
we wouldn't be in this mess.

556
00:29:18.669 --> 00:29:20.280
He's exactly what we need.

557
00:29:20.454 --> 00:29:23.413
and the publicity for Fortico
has been very positive.

558
00:29:23.587 --> 00:29:25.067
Plus. have you heard
the crews talking?

559
00:29:25.241 --> 00:29:26.547
They're inspired.

560
00:29:26.721 --> 00:29:29.028
So. don't punish him.
promote him.

561
00:29:33.075 --> 00:29:34.033
AGENT: Well?

562
00:29:34.207 --> 00:29:35.469
Yes. it was him.

563
00:29:36.165 --> 00:29:38.472
Oh. it had him
written all over it.

564
00:29:38.646 --> 00:29:40.648
Question is.
what was he doing there?

565
00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:43.346
I think we know
what he was doing there. boss.

566
00:29:43.869 --> 00:29:45.696
Oh. clever fucking you.
Hubbard.

567
00:29:45.871 --> 00:29:47.176
It's called sarcasm.

568
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:48.743
HUBBARD:
What do you want us to do?

569
00:29:48.917 --> 00:29:50.658
Not a fucking thing.
Let the painter paint.

570
00:29:50.832 --> 00:29:52.399
HUBBARD: Do you have any idea
what would happen to us

571
00:29:52.573 --> 00:29:53.922
if anyone found out

572
00:29:54.096 --> 00:29:56.229
that we let the fox
in the fucking henhouse?

573
00:29:57.099 --> 00:29:59.710
The Bureau's been trying to
catch this man for 25 years.

574
00:29:59.885 --> 00:30:02.322
We're just gonna let him
sit on hundreds of millions?

575
00:30:02.496 --> 00:30:04.063
Money doesn't mean
a thing to him.

576
00:30:04.237 --> 00:30:05.934
Listen. there's a reason
why I chose you two.

577
00:30:06.108 --> 00:30:08.110
Because we have
the same priorities.

578
00:30:09.285 --> 00:30:11.113
Now. listen to me
very carefully.

579
00:30:12.245 --> 00:30:13.681
As far as you're concerned.

580
00:30:13.855 --> 00:30:14.725
he's just a regular guard
doing a good job.

581
00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:16.031
Do we understand each other?

582
00:30:18.164 --> 00:30:19.730
-Loud and clear.
-

583
00:30:22.255 --> 00:30:23.647
"Let the painter paint"?

584
00:30:25.258 --> 00:30:26.781
What the fuck
does that look like?

585
00:30:42.666 --> 00:30:44.451
Fortico personnel files.

586
00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:47.106
pictures of Dana's family.

587
00:30:50.457 --> 00:30:52.589
the autopsy report.

588
00:31:17.658 --> 00:31:19.225
You hear me?

589
00:31:19.399 --> 00:31:20.748
Out of the fucking car!

590
00:31:20.922 --> 00:31:22.881
Face down. motherfucker!
Come on!

591
00:31:23.055 --> 00:31:24.621
Show me your fucking hands!

592
00:31:24.795 --> 00:31:26.058
Face down
on the ground right now!

593
00:31:29.322 --> 00:31:30.801
-MAN 2: What the fuck?

594
00:31:30.976 --> 00:31:32.586
MAN 1: Face to
the fucking ground!

595
00:31:42.161 --> 00:31:44.772
Seems you can walk on water.
after all.

596
00:31:47.731 --> 00:31:49.690
Keep up the good work.
soldier.

597
00:31:49.864 --> 00:31:51.083
MAN: Nice one. man.

598
00:31:53.781 --> 00:31:55.043
GUARD: Be my guest.

599
00:31:57.741 --> 00:31:58.612
All right. brother.

600
00:32:00.353 --> 00:32:01.920
-MAN: Yeah. man! Let's go!
-

601
00:32:04.879 --> 00:32:06.359
Jump on up. big boy.

602
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:20.155
H: We should get takeout.
From the Blossom.

603
00:32:21.722 --> 00:32:24.594
The noodle soup at Neptune's
is the bomb.

604
00:32:24.768 --> 00:32:26.814
I prefer the Blossom.

605
00:32:27.119 --> 00:32:28.468
All right.

606
00:32:28.903 --> 00:32:30.905
You gonna call the order in?

607
00:32:31.819 --> 00:32:33.168
I'm busy.

608
00:32:33.952 --> 00:32:35.040
I can see that.

609
00:32:35.562 --> 00:32:36.911
-Who's this joker?
-

610
00:32:37.564 --> 00:32:38.826
What the hell's going on?

611
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:39.958
ROBBER 1: Move it!
Get the fuck back!

612
00:32:40.132 --> 00:32:41.220
ROBBER 2: Get down!

613
00:32:43.439 --> 00:32:44.440
H: Reverse! Reverse!

614
00:32:44.614 --> 00:32:45.659
BULLET: I can't fucking see!

615
00:32:51.143 --> 00:32:53.275
Gamma to Base.
we have a Code Red.

616
00:32:54.146 --> 00:32:56.148
JOHN: Gamma. this is Base.
What's your location? Over.

617
00:32:56.322 --> 00:32:57.584
ROBBER 3: Port's covered!

618
00:32:57.758 --> 00:32:59.107
BULLET: Chinatown!
Broadway and Hill.

619
00:32:59.281 --> 00:33:01.805
Repeat. Code Red in progress.

620
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:03.503
JOHN: All right. Gamma.
just follow procedure.

621
00:33:03.677 --> 00:33:05.287
-Stay in the truck. Over.
-

622
00:33:05.461 --> 00:33:06.810
ROBBER 3: Get out
of the fucking truck!

623
00:33:06.985 --> 00:33:08.203
JOHN: Police have been
dispatched.

624
00:33:08.377 --> 00:33:09.726
ROBBER 3: Come on.
get out of there!

625
00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.424
ROBBER 1: Get out
of the fucking truck!

626
00:33:11.598 --> 00:33:13.034
-JOHN: Gamma. come in.

627
00:33:13.208 --> 00:33:14.296
ROBBER 2: On the ground!
Get on the fucking ground!

628
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:15.776
ROBBER 3:
Open the fucking doors!

629
00:33:16.907 --> 00:33:17.908
JOHN: What's your status?
Over.

630
00:33:18.083 --> 00:33:19.171
ROBBER 3: Get down!

631
00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:20.824
Get down!

632
00:33:24.437 --> 00:33:25.873
Get down on the ground!

633
00:33:26.787 --> 00:33:28.571
You got three seconds!

634
00:33:34.577 --> 00:33:37.145
So... So...
So. let me get this straight.

635
00:33:37.319 --> 00:33:38.799
they just walked away?

636
00:33:38.973 --> 00:33:41.280
Get in
the fucking van! Move it!

637
00:33:41.454 --> 00:33:42.716
ROBBER 1:
Let's fucking go now!

638
00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:43.847
ROBBER 2: Get the fuck
out of here!

639
00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.510
Doors were open.

640
00:33:54.684 --> 00:33:56.860
What the fuck was it. Mike?

641
00:33:58.340 --> 00:33:59.341
It was the...

642
00:34:00.342 --> 00:34:01.343
Yeah.

643
00:34:02.475 --> 00:34:04.129
Turned back around and left.

644
00:34:07.436 --> 00:34:09.134
No. I'm sorry...

645
00:34:09.308 --> 00:34:11.919
But what Terry is trying to
say is that you're a legend.

646
00:34:12.093 --> 00:34:13.442
And if you keep this up.

647
00:34:13.616 --> 00:34:15.096
you won't just be
employee of the month.

648
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:17.838
you'll have your own calendar
and merchandise.

649
00:34:19.231 --> 00:34:21.102
Now. get out there
and keep crushing it.

650
00:34:26.977 --> 00:34:28.631
Why are you so cynical?

651
00:34:29.023 --> 00:34:31.156
I'm starting to think
he's a psychopath.

652
00:34:36.509 --> 00:34:38.902
-I hear H is for Hero.

653
00:34:40.382 --> 00:34:41.731
Drink?

654
00:34:57.965 --> 00:34:59.619
It doesn't feel right.

655
00:35:05.407 --> 00:35:06.800
It was as if he recognized H.

656
00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.632
Like he saw a dark spirit.

657
00:35:15.374 --> 00:35:16.418
What are you saying?

658
00:35:18.942 --> 00:35:20.901
BULLET: I don't know
what I'm saying.

659
00:35:23.033 --> 00:35:24.470
He's not a cop.

660
00:35:26.211 --> 00:35:27.908
Doesn't smell like a cop.

661
00:35:29.257 --> 00:35:31.259
But if he's not a cop.
what is he?

662
00:35:33.392 --> 00:35:35.133
He's a dark fucking spirit.

663
00:35:42.836 --> 00:35:44.098
Put that on.

664
00:35:45.055 --> 00:35:46.361
Meet me next door.

665
00:35:49.408 --> 00:35:51.149
I told you that first day...

666
00:35:51.888 --> 00:35:53.194
I don't trust him.

667
00:36:00.897 --> 00:36:02.290
What the hell are you doing?

668
00:36:02.464 --> 00:36:04.118
Sit down.

669
00:36:04.292 --> 00:36:05.772
I'm not fucking sitting down.
I wanna go back to bed.

670
00:36:05.946 --> 00:36:08.644
Dana. Sit down.

671
00:36:32.625 --> 00:36:35.410
You got 10 seconds
to explain this.

672
00:36:36.716 --> 00:36:38.021
I'm not telling you anything.

673
00:36:38.326 --> 00:36:39.893
Dana.

674
00:36:40.067 --> 00:36:43.201
It's very important that
you take my inquiry seriously.

675
00:36:43.375 --> 00:36:44.985
I take it very seriously

676
00:36:45.159 --> 00:36:46.291
that you think
you can interrogate me

677
00:36:46.465 --> 00:36:47.988
in my own fucking house.

678
00:36:52.384 --> 00:36:53.907
Fuck.

679
00:36:54.081 --> 00:36:55.343
Jesus Christ. okay.
it's my savings. all right?

680
00:36:55.517 --> 00:36:56.823
The fuck has it
got to do with you?

681
00:36:56.997 --> 00:36:58.433
Dana. you're not listening.

682
00:36:58.781 --> 00:37:00.130
Fuck! Jeez. all right.
all right. all right!

683
00:37:00.305 --> 00:37:01.915
Please stop.

684
00:37:11.751 --> 00:37:13.013
Sit down.

685
00:37:17.626 --> 00:37:19.237
I found it.

686
00:37:19.411 --> 00:37:20.716
Okay? It had been
signed for one day

687
00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:22.457
by the staff at Grande Liquor.

688
00:37:22.631 --> 00:37:24.024
and they missed it.
It was in the trolley. so...

689
00:37:24.198 --> 00:37:25.112
You stole it?

690
00:37:25.286 --> 00:37:27.332
Yeah. I fucking stole it.

691
00:37:27.506 --> 00:37:29.769
It's 125.000. It's...

692
00:37:30.248 --> 00:37:32.250
It's my retirement fund.

693
00:37:33.251 --> 00:37:34.817
You working
with anyone on the inside?

694
00:37:36.558 --> 00:37:37.820
I don't know what the fuck...

695
00:37:39.344 --> 00:37:42.129
Think carefully before
you answer the question.

696
00:37:47.787 --> 00:37:48.788
No.

697
00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.405
The retirement fund is yours.

698
00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:00.930
But if it comes to light
that you're not telling me

699
00:38:01.104 --> 00:38:03.193
something
that I need to know.

700
00:38:04.847 --> 00:38:07.154
I want you to understand

701
00:38:07.328 --> 00:38:09.504
how resourceful
and serious I am.

702
00:38:10.723 --> 00:38:13.073
On the table
is a picture of your parents.

703
00:38:13.247 --> 00:38:15.118
Had it taken last week.

704
00:38:16.032 --> 00:38:18.121
I got your contacts...

705
00:38:19.427 --> 00:38:20.515
I know who you love...

706
00:38:22.387 --> 00:38:24.954
and I do bear a grudge.

707
00:38:25.955 --> 00:38:27.392
We understand each other?

708
00:38:29.872 --> 00:38:31.265
Good.

709
00:38:39.882 --> 00:38:41.014
BOY: They're saying
that climate change

710
00:38:41.188 --> 00:38:42.537
is a natural phenomenon.

711
00:38:42.711 --> 00:38:44.017
rather than
an artificial phenomenon.

712
00:38:44.191 --> 00:38:45.975
So how do you explain
global warming?

713
00:38:46.149 --> 00:38:47.629
The ice caps melting?

714
00:38:47.803 --> 00:38:50.502
Well. what melts up there
reforms down there.

715
00:38:51.241 --> 00:38:52.634
Do you know why they call
the Arctic the Arctic

716
00:38:52.808 --> 00:38:54.506
and the Antarctic
the Antarctic?

717
00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:56.246
No. Dougie. I don't.

718
00:38:56.421 --> 00:38:58.423
That's why I pay for you
to go to good schools.

719
00:38:58.597 --> 00:38:59.946
"Arktos"means
"bear" in Greek.

720
00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:01.164
"Ant"means "without."

721
00:39:01.339 --> 00:39:04.211
Hence. ant arktos.

722
00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:06.387
"without bears."

723
00:39:06.692 --> 00:39:08.737
Up with. down without.

724
00:39:09.695 --> 00:39:12.654
Good news for ice cubes.
bad news for polar bears.

725
00:39:12.828 --> 00:39:13.829
What time does the game start?

726
00:39:14.003 --> 00:39:16.136
6:30. We've got ages.

727
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:17.833
What do you wanna do?

728
00:39:18.007 --> 00:39:19.313
I don't know. grab some food?

729
00:39:20.967 --> 00:39:22.011
Sure.

730
00:39:22.185 --> 00:39:24.840
Hello? What is it. Mike?

731
00:39:25.014 --> 00:39:26.668
MIKE: We've got a problem
with the job.

732
00:39:26.842 --> 00:39:28.975
We're gonna need you
to put eyes on the truck.

733
00:39:32.587 --> 00:39:34.023
Dougie. go get a coat.
will ya?

734
00:39:34.807 --> 00:39:36.112
It's not gonna rain.

735
00:39:36.591 --> 00:39:38.332
Dougie. coat.

736
00:39:38.506 --> 00:39:40.073
But why?

737
00:39:40.247 --> 00:39:43.032
'Cause I'm your dad.
and I said so.

738
00:39:46.209 --> 00:39:47.646
Get someone else to do it.

739
00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:49.561
I can't. boss.
There is no one else.

740
00:39:49.735 --> 00:39:50.649
It's gotta be you.

741
00:39:50.823 --> 00:39:52.607
Joe. two fuckin' minutes!

742
00:39:52.781 --> 00:39:54.130
H: I'm with my son. Mike.

743
00:39:54.304 --> 00:39:55.915
You know Dougie's
over here on holiday.

744
00:39:56.089 --> 00:39:57.656
and it's the only time
I get to see him.

745
00:39:57.830 --> 00:39:59.832
It's your fuckin' job.
You do it.

746
00:40:00.572 --> 00:40:01.964
MIKE: Understood.

747
00:40:03.575 --> 00:40:05.446
Brendan was on it. but he got
knocked off his bike

748
00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:06.926
by a drunk driver.

749
00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:09.668
Make sure the boss knows
it's not my fault.

750
00:40:09.842 --> 00:40:11.539
It's a drunk driver.

751
00:40:11.713 --> 00:40:13.149
Now. he's with the police
right now. making a statement.

752
00:40:13.323 --> 00:40:14.542
Otherwise.
he'd find a way to be there.

753
00:40:14.716 --> 00:40:15.804
There is no one else.

754
00:40:16.152 --> 00:40:17.197
I'm out of town.

755
00:40:17.371 --> 00:40:19.504
Moggy's surveying the depot.

756
00:40:19.982 --> 00:40:21.723
I'd help if I could. Mike.

757
00:40:21.897 --> 00:40:23.595
But my eyeballs
are on the depot.

758
00:40:23.769 --> 00:40:25.118
Then postpone it.

759
00:40:25.292 --> 00:40:26.989
MIKE: Oh. we can do that
if you want.

760
00:40:27.163 --> 00:40:28.948
but it's gonna set us back
three months of recon.

761
00:40:29.122 --> 00:40:31.603
We need to know the route.
If they turn left or right.

762
00:40:31.777 --> 00:40:33.126
That's all
you have to witness.

763
00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.823
Yeah. and there's no danger
to it at all.

764
00:40:34.997 --> 00:40:37.217
You can stand back
a thousand yards.

765
00:40:37.391 --> 00:40:39.262
Didn't you put trackers
on the truck?

766
00:40:39.872 --> 00:40:41.264
MIKE: They scan the trucks

767
00:40:41.439 --> 00:40:42.352
every time
they return to the base.

768
00:40:42.527 --> 00:40:44.180
We can't do it digitally.

769
00:40:44.354 --> 00:40:46.095
We gotta put eyes on it. And.

770
00:40:46.269 --> 00:40:48.054
-boss?
-

771
00:40:48.837 --> 00:40:50.491
Tracking you on your phone
right now.

772
00:40:50.665 --> 00:40:52.362
You're blocks away.
Ten minutes.

773
00:40:52.537 --> 00:40:55.148
And I repeat. no danger.

774
00:40:56.976 --> 00:40:58.064
DOUGIE: Dad?

775
00:40:59.021 --> 00:41:01.023
-Happy?
-Happy.

776
00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:14.167
I'm starving. Fancy a burrito?

777
00:41:14.341 --> 00:41:16.299
You don't even like burritos.

778
00:41:16.474 --> 00:41:17.997
I know. but I'm starving.

779
00:41:19.041 --> 00:41:20.042
Sure.

780
00:41:25.483 --> 00:41:27.006
I'll be two minutes. okay?

781
00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:30.183
Keep the doors locked.
Don't go anywhere.

782
00:41:30.357 --> 00:41:31.401
All right.

783
00:41:43.326 --> 00:41:44.284
CHEF: Yes. sir?

784
00:41:44.458 --> 00:41:45.503
Two burritos. please. sir.

785
00:41:45.677 --> 00:41:46.721
CHEF: You got it.

786
00:41:47.026 --> 00:41:48.114
Go ahead. Mike.

787
00:41:48.288 --> 00:41:50.072
MIKE: I can see you there.

788
00:41:50.246 --> 00:41:54.381
Now. is there some gates
on your left-hand side?

789
00:41:56.426 --> 00:41:57.427
H: Yeah.

790
00:41:57.602 --> 00:41:58.951
MIKE: Now. in a minute.

791
00:41:59.125 --> 00:42:01.083
those said gates
are gonna open.

792
00:42:01.867 --> 00:42:04.260
and that said minute is now.

793
00:42:09.657 --> 00:42:11.441
All I need to know from you

794
00:42:11.616 --> 00:42:14.314
is if that truck
is turning left or right.

795
00:42:19.754 --> 00:42:20.973
Latter.

796
00:42:25.194 --> 00:42:27.022
CHARLIE: You know.
make your own cappuccino.

797
00:42:27.457 --> 00:42:29.285
MICK: Ugh. God damn!

798
00:42:29.459 --> 00:42:30.765
CHARLIE: What is this?

799
00:42:49.305 --> 00:42:51.786
MAN 1: Yo. out of
the fuckin' car! Come on!

800
00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:54.267
Don't fuckin' look at me!
Out of the fuckin' car!

801
00:42:54.441 --> 00:42:57.052
-

802
00:42:57.226 --> 00:42:58.532
All right. Mike.

803
00:42:58.706 --> 00:43:00.360
That's my day done.

804
00:43:00.534 --> 00:43:01.927
AUTOMATED VOICE: Your call
has been forwarded to...

805
00:43:02.101 --> 00:43:03.842
MAN 1: You hear me?
Out of the fuckin' car!

806
00:43:04.016 --> 00:43:05.539
Face down. motherfucker!
Come on!

807
00:43:05.931 --> 00:43:07.367
Show me your fuckin' hands!

808
00:43:07.541 --> 00:43:09.848
Face down on the ground
right now!

809
00:43:10.022 --> 00:43:11.458
There you go.

810
00:43:11.632 --> 00:43:12.807
MAN 2: Do what we say.
and you fucking live.

811
00:43:12.981 --> 00:43:14.809
MAN 1: Face to
the fucking ground!

812
00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:17.464
-Thank you.
-CHEF: Have a good one.

813
00:43:21.947 --> 00:43:23.209
MAN 3: Two minutes!

814
00:43:23.557 --> 00:43:25.037
-

815
00:43:30.303 --> 00:43:31.391
MAN 3: Fuck!

816
00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:34.307
MAN 4: Number one.
are we good?

817
00:43:34.481 --> 00:43:36.309
-Are we good. number one?
-MAN 3: We're good.

818
00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:38.050
Dougie?

819
00:45:14.233 --> 00:45:17.105
Try not to. uh.
move too quickly.

820
00:45:17.279 --> 00:45:18.933
You're in a hospital.

821
00:45:19.325 --> 00:45:21.893
You were in an accident.
you were shot at.

822
00:45:22.894 --> 00:45:24.591
Six bullets removed.

823
00:45:24.765 --> 00:45:26.985
and three operations.

824
00:45:27.463 --> 00:45:29.422
Two life-saving.

825
00:45:29.596 --> 00:45:31.511
You lost
a fifth of your blood.

826
00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:35.733
You've... You've got
a warrior's spirit. Mr. Mace.

827
00:45:37.735 --> 00:45:39.084
What about my son?

828
00:45:42.391 --> 00:45:43.523
Dougie.

829
00:45:57.842 --> 00:45:59.582
WOMAN: My beautiful boy.

830
00:46:05.458 --> 00:46:07.155
And now. he's gone.

831
00:46:12.073 --> 00:46:13.771
He looked up to you.

832
00:46:20.081 --> 00:46:22.257
He was obsessed with you.

833
00:46:27.697 --> 00:46:29.525
It wasn't my work. Jane.

834
00:46:34.879 --> 00:46:37.142
You killed our son.

835
00:46:50.111 --> 00:46:52.722
And still.
you have nothing to say.

836
00:47:01.122 --> 00:47:05.474
You are a cold. cold cunt.

837
00:47:41.162 --> 00:47:43.295
AGENT: My condolences
for your loss.

838
00:47:47.821 --> 00:47:50.780
Before you ask. we have
no leads on this thing.

839
00:47:51.999 --> 00:47:54.567
Which is kinda strange
for a job this big.

840
00:47:57.526 --> 00:47:59.137
Somebody knows something.

841
00:47:59.311 --> 00:48:00.834
Somebody always
knows something.

842
00:48:01.008 --> 00:48:03.576
It's just I'm not allowed
to ask the hard questions.

843
00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.715
Here's the shit list.

844
00:48:13.194 --> 00:48:15.066
Knock yourself out.

845
00:48:23.552 --> 00:48:25.032
Need any of them to live?

846
00:48:25.815 --> 00:48:29.080
I don't miss anyone that
your boys have buried so far.

847
00:48:31.996 --> 00:48:34.346
Then you're gonna
let me do this my way.

848
00:48:38.306 --> 00:48:40.569
I can do in two weeks

849
00:48:40.743 --> 00:48:43.224
what you only wish
you could do in 20 years.

850
00:48:45.487 --> 00:48:46.575
If their names
are on that list.

851
00:48:46.749 --> 00:48:48.186
you can do your worst.

852
00:48:50.318 --> 00:48:51.711
Just be mindful

853
00:48:51.885 --> 00:48:53.931
that I can only look confused
for so long.

854
00:48:55.454 --> 00:48:56.716
The floor is yours.

855
00:49:13.733 --> 00:49:15.082
MOGGY: Brendan.

856
00:49:16.866 --> 00:49:18.477
You need to quit that.

857
00:49:18.651 --> 00:49:20.609
I can hardly breathe here.

858
00:49:21.567 --> 00:49:23.221
MOGGY: It wasn't your fault.

859
00:49:24.135 --> 00:49:25.658
It was a drunk driver.

860
00:49:27.181 --> 00:49:29.183
That's easy for you to say.

861
00:49:29.357 --> 00:49:31.577
It's his son. Moggy.
His only son.

862
00:49:31.751 --> 00:49:33.796
Hey. we all fucked up.

863
00:49:33.971 --> 00:49:35.755
So. let's accept
responsibility

864
00:49:35.929 --> 00:49:37.757
and not turn on each other
in there.

865
00:49:38.366 --> 00:49:41.630
Brendan. retain your dignity.

866
00:49:49.508 --> 00:49:51.640
MIKE: It's a fuckin' tragedy.
boss.

867
00:49:51.814 --> 00:49:55.253
MOGGY: We all loved Dougie
and our sympathies run deep.

868
00:49:55.427 --> 00:49:56.994
BRENDAN: It's more my fault
than anyone's.

869
00:49:57.168 --> 00:49:59.648
and we'll do anything
to find who's responsible.

870
00:50:03.217 --> 00:50:05.263
I need to know
who pulled the trigger.

871
00:50:08.527 --> 00:50:10.050
I need a face.

872
00:50:10.224 --> 00:50:11.356
MOGGY: Of course.

873
00:50:12.444 --> 00:50:13.749
And we've been
on nothing else.

874
00:50:13.923 --> 00:50:15.142
trying to get answers.

875
00:50:15.708 --> 00:50:17.753
It's not any
of the usual suspects.

876
00:50:21.235 --> 00:50:23.672
You're gonna tell us
what we wanna know.

877
00:50:25.587 --> 00:50:27.937
This is your last chance.

878
00:50:29.156 --> 00:50:30.853
The tree has been shook.

879
00:50:32.029 --> 00:50:33.421
And it's been shook hard.

880
00:50:36.946 --> 00:50:38.687
I want a name.

881
00:50:39.732 --> 00:50:42.909
Anyone with the skillset
or the form.

882
00:50:43.779 --> 00:50:45.520
We've run out of names.

883
00:50:45.694 --> 00:50:49.089
We've deployed large amounts
of time. money. and effort...

884
00:50:49.263 --> 00:50:51.961
-...in the search for justice.

885
00:50:53.746 --> 00:50:55.269
It was a long list.

886
00:50:55.965 --> 00:50:57.184
Not good enough.

887
00:50:57.358 --> 00:50:59.099
MOGGY: Understood.

888
00:50:59.578 --> 00:51:01.493
but we've scorched the earth.

889
00:51:02.755 --> 00:51:04.409
H: No. it's not understood.

890
00:51:06.715 --> 00:51:08.978
You started by saying
you'd do anything.

891
00:51:09.153 --> 00:51:11.242
but what I'm hearing is

892
00:51:11.416 --> 00:51:13.548
you think
you've done everything.

893
00:51:22.644 --> 00:51:24.037
Understood.

894
00:51:24.429 --> 00:51:26.692
I hear the train a-comin'

895
00:51:28.607 --> 00:51:31.000
It's rollin' 'round the bend

896
00:51:33.046 --> 00:51:35.570
And I ain't seen the sunshine

897
00:51:37.268 --> 00:51:39.966
Since I don't know when

898
00:51:41.794 --> 00:51:44.318
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison

899
00:51:44.492 --> 00:51:47.452
And time keeps draggin' on

900
00:51:50.368 --> 00:51:52.935
But that train keeps a-rollin'

901
00:51:55.242 --> 00:51:58.332
On down to San Antone

902
00:51:59.638 --> 00:52:02.815
On down to San Antone

903
00:52:05.905 --> 00:52:08.342
When I was just a baby

904
00:52:10.127 --> 00:52:11.911
My mama told me. "Son..."

905
00:52:12.085 --> 00:52:13.347
The fuck?

906
00:52:13.521 --> 00:52:14.783
MOGGY: Make a sound
and you're dead.

907
00:52:15.262 --> 00:52:16.437
-"Always be a good boy"
-What the fuck?

908
00:52:16.611 --> 00:52:18.222
-

909
00:52:18.396 --> 00:52:19.397
Get off me!

910
00:52:19.571 --> 00:52:21.747
"Don't ever play with guns"

911
00:52:24.053 --> 00:52:26.360
All right. Jerome.
what do you think?

912
00:52:26.534 --> 00:52:28.449
It's getting late.
We all got places to go.

913
00:52:28.623 --> 00:52:29.842
So. why don't you
save us a lot of time

914
00:52:30.016 --> 00:52:31.235
and you a lot of trouble

915
00:52:31.409 --> 00:52:32.453
and tell us
what we need to know?

916
00:52:32.801 --> 00:52:34.499
Trouble?

917
00:52:34.673 --> 00:52:37.154
You motherfuckers got no idea
how much trouble you in.

918
00:52:37.328 --> 00:52:38.677
Do you know who the fuck I am?

919
00:52:38.851 --> 00:52:40.244
Yeah. I know
exactly who you are.

920
00:52:40.418 --> 00:52:41.810
and that's why you're here.

921
00:52:41.984 --> 00:52:43.160
So. I can see
it's gonna be a long night.

922
00:52:43.334 --> 00:52:44.335
Let's get started.

923
00:52:44.683 --> 00:52:45.727
Bag him.

924
00:52:46.554 --> 00:52:47.903
You motherfuckers!

925
00:52:48.077 --> 00:52:49.470
I hear the train a-comin'

926
00:52:49.644 --> 00:52:50.689
Get the fuck off me!

927
00:52:52.865 --> 00:52:54.693
-It's rollin' 'round the bend
-

928
00:52:56.956 --> 00:52:59.567
And I ain't seen the sunshine

929
00:53:01.047 --> 00:53:03.919
Since I don't know when

930
00:53:06.095 --> 00:53:08.054
When I was just a baby

931
00:53:10.143 --> 00:53:12.624
My mama told me. "Son...

932
00:53:14.887 --> 00:53:17.106
"Always be a good boy

933
00:53:18.717 --> 00:53:21.328
"Don't ever play with guns"

934
00:53:26.899 --> 00:53:28.901
-All right. take it off.

935
00:53:44.003 --> 00:53:46.092
I don't think
he knows anything.

936
00:53:51.271 --> 00:53:52.794
We'll see about that.

937
00:53:59.932 --> 00:54:02.500
I hear you're a tough lad
and a hard worker.

938
00:54:03.631 --> 00:54:05.111
Good for you.

939
00:54:06.939 --> 00:54:08.375
But you're still
gonna give me a name.

940
00:54:11.117 --> 00:54:13.250
If not for your life.
for hers.

941
00:54:16.296 --> 00:54:17.558
JEROME: What the fuck?

942
00:54:17.732 --> 00:54:19.517
Don't touch her!
I said don't touch her!

943
00:54:20.126 --> 00:54:21.345
Don't fucking touch her!

944
00:54:21.519 --> 00:54:22.998
-Leave her out of this!
-Bag her.

945
00:54:23.172 --> 00:54:24.043
-

946
00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:26.393
JEROME: All right.

947
00:54:27.002 --> 00:54:29.701
The only fuckin' name.

948
00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:38.449
The Gashi brothers.

949
00:54:52.985 --> 00:54:54.943
If it's anyone. it's them.

950
00:54:56.205 --> 00:54:57.511
Fucking dark.

951
00:54:57.685 --> 00:55:02.299
Porn. trafficking.
witchcraft. kids.

952
00:55:02.473 --> 00:55:04.388
home invasions.

953
00:55:04.562 --> 00:55:07.173
It's talked about
there's cash trucks. too.

954
00:55:07.565 --> 00:55:09.131
But you did not
hear this from me.

955
00:55:09.306 --> 00:55:10.437
and if you did.

956
00:55:11.525 --> 00:55:12.526
kill me now.

957
00:55:22.101 --> 00:55:23.885
Give him 200 grand.

958
00:55:24.059 --> 00:55:25.800
Put the keys in the car.

959
00:55:42.251 --> 00:55:43.949
Pass me the water.

960
00:55:46.038 --> 00:55:47.779
-You all right?
-

961
00:55:49.781 --> 00:55:51.173
No. I'm not.

962
00:55:52.523 --> 00:55:54.263
It's a shitshow.

963
00:55:55.569 --> 00:55:57.310
Fucking reptiles.

964
00:56:00.705 --> 00:56:02.663
There's kids involved.

965
00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:08.495
Got a feeling I'm gonna
be cleaning up all day.

966
00:56:21.726 --> 00:56:22.857
Mike!

967
00:57:16.215 --> 00:57:17.782
MIKE: Here you go. sweetheart.

968
00:57:17.956 --> 00:57:19.566
Drink some water.

969
00:57:20.262 --> 00:57:21.960
There's a good girl.

970
00:57:30.359 --> 00:57:32.187
-

971
00:57:35.930 --> 00:57:37.758
-

972
00:57:37.932 --> 00:57:38.977
-

973
00:57:53.513 --> 00:57:55.384
How much is in the pot?

974
00:57:56.908 --> 00:57:58.605
I'd say 2.5.

975
00:57:59.998 --> 00:58:01.739
So. what do you think?

976
00:58:03.523 --> 00:58:04.655
I think

977
00:58:05.873 --> 00:58:07.135
it isn't them.

978
00:58:10.487 --> 00:58:12.576
You gotta tell the boss.

979
00:58:22.237 --> 00:58:24.370
MOGGY: They're filthy fucks.

980
00:58:24.544 --> 00:58:27.373
And they have done trucks.
but they ain't our men.

981
00:58:27.547 --> 00:58:29.767
That job was above them.

982
00:58:29.941 --> 00:58:32.726
They're more
about the smash-and-grab.

983
00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:34.075
Looks like
there's two and a half mil.

984
00:58:34.249 --> 00:58:35.207
which they confessed to.

985
00:58:35.381 --> 00:58:36.513
but. uh.

986
00:58:37.688 --> 00:58:39.385
what do you want me to do?

987
00:58:43.737 --> 00:58:45.783
Don't want you
to do anything. Moggy.

988
00:59:02.756 --> 00:59:04.497
How old are these girls?

989
00:59:06.194 --> 00:59:07.805
Not old enough.

990
00:59:16.030 --> 00:59:17.466
-

991
00:59:17.728 --> 00:59:19.425
Give the girls the cash.

992
00:59:20.034 --> 00:59:21.296
Let 'em go.

993
00:59:51.675 --> 00:59:54.068
Can I speak candidly. boss?

994
00:59:58.638 --> 01:00:00.640
I don't think
we should do this again.

995
01:00:03.077 --> 01:00:04.949
Understandably. you're...

996
01:00:06.298 --> 01:00:08.692
You're not in your right mind
just now and

997
01:00:10.128 --> 01:00:11.608
you need a break.

998
01:00:14.393 --> 01:00:15.699
But we can't continue

999
01:00:15.873 --> 01:00:17.526
to handle business this way.
otherwise

1000
01:00:18.223 --> 01:00:21.182
some fucker's gonna come for
us before we can get to them.

1001
01:00:24.229 --> 01:00:25.230
In truth.

1002
01:00:25.404 --> 01:00:27.014
we need a different approach.

1003
01:00:30.278 --> 01:00:32.716
It's gotta be an inside job.

1004
01:00:34.674 --> 01:00:36.415
You're right. Mike.

1005
01:00:38.373 --> 01:00:40.288
I shouldn't have
got you involved.

1006
01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:47.034
I'm gonna go back
to London for a while.

1007
01:00:51.299 --> 01:00:52.431
WOMAN: Patrick.

1008
01:00:52.779 --> 01:00:55.608
Patrick?
I'm a Brit. not a Mick.

1009
01:00:55.782 --> 01:00:57.392
So. your mom's Irish.

1010
01:00:57.566 --> 01:00:59.090
Usual affair.

01:00:59.264 --> 01:01:01.179
This time. you're

01:01:07.141 --> 01:01:09.187
All your criminal checks
are clean.

1016

You've got 25 years' worth

1018
01:01:14.366 --> 01:01:16.760
and the same for
the previous addresses. too.

1019
01:01:16.934 --> 01:01:18.805
Your employment history
has been inserted

1020
01:01:18.979 --> 01:01:22.156
into the Delta Orange
Security system.

1021
01:01:22.330 --> 01:01:24.376
So. should anyone check.

1022
01:01:24.550 --> 01:01:27.466
you've worked there
for 11 years.

1023
01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:29.163
You even finished college.

1024
01:01:29.337 --> 01:01:33.602
and have held the same
gym membership since 2011.

1025
01:01:33.777 --> 01:01:37.389
As requested.

1026
01:01:37.563 --> 01:01:40.958
and finally.
the hotel has been arranged.

1027
01:01:42.002 --> 01:01:43.961
It's another brand-new you.

1028
01:01:44.570 --> 01:01:46.137
Kirsty. one more thing.

1029
01:01:47.181 --> 01:01:49.183
Get me a copy
of the coroner's report.

1030
01:01:52.665 --> 01:01:54.232
You sure that's a good idea?

1031
01:01:54.406 --> 01:01:55.363
Just do it.

1032
01:01:56.147 --> 01:01:57.539
TERRY: And your reference from

1033
01:01:57.714 --> 01:01:59.237

No.

TERRY: It's a pleasure
to meet you. Mr. Hill.

You ain't much for talking.

1040
01:02:14.774 --> 01:02:16.428
Let me buy you a beer.

Face down on the ground

DOUGIE: Please.

1047
01:02:43.455 --> 01:02:45.283
MAN: How are you
holdin' up. Sam?

1048
01:02:45.587 --> 01:02:47.415
What's to say?

1049
01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:51.115
I wake up late. watch TV.

1050
01:02:51.289 --> 01:02:53.726
drink a beer
and watch more TV.

1051
01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:55.554
Maybe convince Ma
to give me a few bucks.

1052
01:02:55.728 --> 01:02:57.774
so I can buy more beer and

1053
01:02:57.948 --> 01:03:00.777
watch TV until I'm drunk
enough to fall asleep.

1054
01:03:01.952 --> 01:03:03.867
Did I mention I watch TV?

1055
01:03:05.912 --> 01:03:08.045
MAN: You're awfully quiet.
Brad.

1056
01:03:08.219 --> 01:03:10.003
I'm not quiet.

01:03:10.482 --> 01:03:11.831
I'm bored.

1058
01:03:12.005 --> 01:03:12.919
MAN: Bored of what?

1059
01:03:13.093 --> 01:03:15.269
Not fuckin' working.

1060
01:03:16.096 --> 01:03:20.057
We're built for combat.
not daytime TV.

1061
01:03:22.233 --> 01:03:25.323
The Afghanis treated us better
than our own.

1062
01:03:26.411 --> 01:03:28.674
I wish I was back in the unit.

1063
01:03:29.588 --> 01:03:32.112
Boredom's more dangerous
than bullets.

1064
01:03:33.722 --> 01:03:36.551
Give me an enemy
I can fuckin' see.

1065
01:03:40.773 --> 01:03:42.470
How about you?
You workin' yet. boss?

1066
01:03:43.341 --> 01:03:44.995
Still part-time at the mall.

1067
01:03:45.734 --> 01:03:47.127
Costin' more than I'm making.

1068
01:03:47.301 --> 01:03:49.434
If it wasn't
for Amy's parents.

1069
01:03:49.608 --> 01:03:51.001
we'd be on the street.

1070
01:03:51.175 --> 01:03:52.524
JAN: Yeah. it seems like
Carlos is the only one

1071
01:03:52.698 --> 01:03:55.048
who landed on his feet
with the oil tycoon.

1072
01:03:55.222 --> 01:03:58.051
So. I'm there from 6:00 in
the mornin' to 12:00 at night.

1073
01:03:58.704 --> 01:04:00.662
This motherfucker's
drippin' in gold.

1074
01:04:00.837 --> 01:04:02.708
and I haven't seen
a dollar in overtime yet.

1075
01:04:02.882 --> 01:04:04.101
One minute.
we're killin' Arabs.

1076
01:04:04.275 --> 01:04:05.493
the next minute.
we're wiping their ass.

1077
01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:07.582
Afghanis aren't Arabs.

1078
01:04:07.756 --> 01:04:10.194
They're not? What are they?

1079
01:04:10.716 --> 01:04:11.760
Clue's in the name.

1080
01:04:11.935 --> 01:04:13.501
JACKSON: Afghanis.

1081
01:04:13.675 --> 01:04:16.591
Whatever.
they're not Americans.

1082
01:04:16.765 --> 01:04:18.637
Know what I wanna do?

1083
01:04:19.116 --> 01:04:20.944
I wanna lift one of
those precious ornaments

1084
01:04:21.118 --> 01:04:23.424
until I get
my motherfuckin' overtime pay.

1085
01:04:23.598 --> 01:04:24.861
And why don't you?

1086
01:04:26.123 --> 01:04:27.864
Why don't I what?

1087
01:04:29.953 --> 01:04:31.824
Make them pay.

1088
01:04:35.784 --> 01:04:36.960
They owe us.

1089
01:04:39.049 --> 01:04:40.877
Why you askin' me?

1090
01:04:41.529 --> 01:04:42.704
Ask Sarge.

1091
01:04:51.626 --> 01:04:53.411
Do they keep cash?

1092
01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:05.814
What's that?

1093
01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:11.733
JACKSON: That is it.

1094
01:05:13.126 --> 01:05:14.301
That's fuckin' what?

1095
01:05:15.346 --> 01:05:16.825
JACKSON: That is what is left

1096
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.740
after we washed it
through the system.

1097
01:05:19.306 --> 01:05:20.742
SAM: What's on the table?

1098
01:05:21.004 --> 01:05:22.527
JACKSON: 110.

1099
01:05:23.006 --> 01:05:25.660
TOM: Two Rolexes. a Patek.

1100
01:05:25.834 --> 01:05:28.620
6-carat ring. chains.
40 grand cash.

1101
01:05:29.055 --> 01:05:30.404
CARLOS: Wait a minute.

1102
01:05:30.578 --> 01:05:31.710
I got hit over the head
and lost my job

1103
01:05:31.884 --> 01:05:34.147
for. like. 18 Gs apiece?

1104
01:05:34.756 --> 01:05:36.889
SAM: I thought we worked out
over half a million in solids.

1105
01:05:37.368 --> 01:05:40.588
We did the legwork.
we made the calls.

1106
01:05:40.762 --> 01:05:41.850
BRAD: Number one.
JAN: Go ahead. four.

1107
01:05:42.025 --> 01:05:43.200
Incoming.

1108
01:05:43.548 --> 01:05:46.855
We spent the sweat.
we dealt with the fence.

1109
01:05:48.248 --> 01:05:49.510
That's what we get.

1110
01:05:50.555 --> 01:05:51.599
JAN: Salaam alaikum.

1111
01:05:53.471 --> 01:05:54.602
JACKSON: Even split.

1112
01:05:57.954 --> 01:06:00.304
We're not the Mafia.
We're soldiers.

1113
01:06:00.869 --> 01:06:02.828
Nah. somethin'
ain't right here.

1114
01:06:04.351 --> 01:06:05.570
You trying to say
something. Jan?

1115
01:06:05.744 --> 01:06:06.919
Fuck off. Jan.

1116
01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:09.966
Go find another bone to chew.

1117
01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:11.619
You'll break your teeth
on this one.

1118
01:06:11.793 --> 01:06:14.013
And stand up
when the boss is talkin'.

1119
01:06:22.587 --> 01:06:24.458
JACKSON: We could change it.
though.

1120
01:06:24.632 --> 01:06:25.677
Cut out the middleman.

1121
01:06:26.634 --> 01:06:27.766
What does that mean?

1122
01:06:29.811 --> 01:06:31.378
JACKSON: We want cash.

1123
01:06:33.032 --> 01:06:34.555
We go after cash.

1124
01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:36.688
We got a guy on the inside.

1125
01:06:37.123 --> 01:06:38.385
Inside of what?

1126
01:06:40.561 --> 01:06:41.562
Cash trucks.

1127
01:06:45.827 --> 01:06:49.570
We took in 1.18 million.

1128
01:06:52.182 --> 01:06:53.487
-CARLOS: That's three years'

1129
01:06:53.661 --> 01:06:54.836
worth of work
in one day. baby!

1130
01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:59.145
That's $168.571 each.

1131
01:06:59.319 --> 01:07:01.017
SAM: That's a lot of paper
right there.

1132
01:07:01.191 --> 01:07:02.583
CARLOS: Hold on...
Hold on a second.

1133
01:07:02.757 --> 01:07:05.195
that's split seven ways.
not six?

1134
01:07:05.369 --> 01:07:06.413
BRAD: Thirty seconds.

1135
01:07:06.718 --> 01:07:07.893
There might not be
a middleman.

1136
01:07:08.067 --> 01:07:08.981
but there is a man
on the inside.

1137
01:07:09.155 --> 01:07:10.156
He needs a slice.

1138
01:07:16.554 --> 01:07:18.425
And who is this inside man?

1139
01:07:19.948 --> 01:07:20.993
You don't need to know.

1140
01:07:22.386 --> 01:07:24.518
JACKSON: Uh-uh-uh. Yes.
motherfuckers. these are guns.

1141
01:07:24.692 --> 01:07:25.911
and we will not hesitate
to kill you.

1142
01:07:26.085 --> 01:07:27.434
CARLOS:
Hands behind your back.

1143
01:07:27.608 --> 01:07:29.045
JAN: Don't be a hero.
It's not your money.

1144
01:07:29.219 --> 01:07:30.350
BRAD: Show me your
fuckin' hands. white boy.

1145
01:07:30.524 --> 01:07:31.656
JAN: Put your hand
behind your back.

1146
01:07:31.830 --> 01:07:33.049
JACKSON:
What's your driver's name?

1147
01:07:33.353 --> 01:07:34.746
If you lie to me.
I'll fuckin' kill you.

1148
01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:36.878
-Chad.
-JACKSON: Chad fucking what?

1149
01:07:37.444 --> 01:07:38.358
Chad Reed.

1150
01:07:38.532 --> 01:07:39.881
JACKSON: Horrible name.

1151
01:07:40.056 --> 01:07:41.753
Gentlemen.
we have found our opportunity

1152
01:07:41.927 --> 01:07:43.189
to stand tall again

1153
01:07:44.016 --> 01:07:47.367
after years taking it
staring at our laces.

1154
01:07:48.368 --> 01:07:50.631
Don't quit
your day job just yet.

1155
01:07:50.805 --> 01:07:53.069
Rhythm as normal. Be smart.

1156
01:07:53.243 --> 01:07:55.245
Don't go buying
anything flashy.

1157
01:07:55.419 --> 01:07:57.812
Just what you absolutely need.
Do you hear me. Jan?

1158
01:07:59.118 --> 01:08:01.251
Oh. yeah.
Loud and clear. boss.

1159
01:08:02.078 --> 01:08:05.516
TOM: Groceries. good.
Sports cars. bad.

1160
01:08:06.821 --> 01:08:08.475
JACKSON: This isn't
retirement money.

1161
01:08:08.649 --> 01:08:10.260
But we play it right.
it could be.

1162
01:08:10.434 --> 01:08:12.523
-CHAD: Yo. Dave. come in.

1163
01:08:15.917 --> 01:08:17.397
Come in. Dave.

1164
01:08:17.571 --> 01:08:19.225
Just checkin'
everything's as it should be.

1165
01:08:20.008 --> 01:08:21.749
All good here. Chad.

1166
01:08:21.923 --> 01:08:23.795
Be out in two.

1167
01:08:25.884 --> 01:08:27.668
Did that just go as smooth
as I thought it did?

1168
01:08:27.842 --> 01:08:29.453
Yeah. don't count
your chickens just yet.

1169
01:08:32.978 --> 01:08:33.979
OFFICER 1: Hold up.

1170
01:08:34.588 --> 01:08:35.850
OFFICER 2: Gentlemen.

1171
01:08:36.024 --> 01:08:37.417
If I could just
get your signatures.

1172
01:08:37.591 --> 01:08:39.550
-How's it goin'?
-All right.

1173
01:08:41.856 --> 01:08:43.206
-Fantastic.
-Thank you.

1174
01:08:44.816 --> 01:08:46.731
BRAD: I'm telling you now.

1175
01:08:46.905 --> 01:08:49.037
there's more gold
in these hills.

1176
01:08:49.212 --> 01:08:52.040
JAN: Yeah. And we haven't even
tapped into our skillset.

1177
01:08:52.215 --> 01:08:54.042
BRAD: Monkeys could've
done that job.

1178
01:08:54.217 --> 01:08:55.174
So. let's push
ourselves. then.

1179
01:08:55.348 --> 01:08:56.262
JACKSON: Easy. boys.

1180
01:08:56.436 --> 01:08:58.090
Walking before running.

1181
01:08:58.786 --> 01:09:00.658
Yeah. I don't know
about you guys.

1182
01:09:00.832 --> 01:09:01.876
but I feel like
I've been walkin'

1183
01:09:02.050 --> 01:09:03.487
for a long fuckin' time.

1184
01:09:03.661 --> 01:09:08.492
Happy birthday to you

1185
01:09:08.970 --> 01:09:13.366
Happy birthday to you

1186
01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:17.631
Happy birthday. dear Jack

1187
01:09:17.805 --> 01:09:19.807
-MAN: Happy birthday. Daddy!

1188
01:09:19.981 --> 01:09:24.986
Happy birthday to you

1189
01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:28.033
-SAM: Yeah!

1190
01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:31.428
It's gettin'
harder and harder.

1191
01:09:34.735 --> 01:09:36.650
I know it is my birthday.

1192
01:09:36.824 --> 01:09:39.871
but I've got
a present for you.

1193
01:09:41.089 --> 01:09:42.656
What are you sittin' on.
old man?

1194
01:09:42.830 --> 01:09:46.878
More work.
but with a significant bump.

1195
01:09:47.052 --> 01:09:48.445
It's another truck.

1196
01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:51.143
This time. there's gonna be
at least 6 mil inside.

1197
01:09:51.578 --> 01:09:53.450
-Now. we're talkin'.

1198
01:09:53.624 --> 01:09:56.148
SAM: Well. it's a lot more
profitable than killin' Arabs.

1199
01:09:56.322 --> 01:09:58.019
and it makes my blood flow.

1200
01:10:02.067 --> 01:10:03.677
Sweetheart.
what about the kids?

1201
01:10:03.851 --> 01:10:05.026
Yeah. feed them first.

1202
01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:06.332
Bad animals. bad.

1203
01:10:07.899 --> 01:10:09.466
JAN: Sorry. Mrs. Ainsley.

1204
01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:11.250
Here. let me help you with...
help you with that.

1205
01:10:12.556 --> 01:10:14.079
JAN: Is the intel good?

1206
01:10:15.385 --> 01:10:16.777
We got a good inside man.

1207
01:10:17.125 --> 01:10:18.518
He's one of us.

1208
01:10:18.692 --> 01:10:19.867
Served under me
back in the day.

1209
01:10:20.041 --> 01:10:21.347
Well. I'm in.

1210
01:10:21.521 --> 01:10:23.219
I just wanna get back
in the field.

1211
01:10:23.393 --> 01:10:27.527
but I fuckin' love a mission.

1212
01:10:27.701 --> 01:10:29.050
Yeah. but what's the downside?

1213
01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:31.183
We're gonna be
way more exposed.

1214
01:10:31.357 --> 01:10:33.054
and it will warrant
significant planning.

1215
01:10:33.533 --> 01:10:36.144
There will be six weeks
of training and recon.

1216
01:11:14.095 --> 01:11:15.488
JACKSON: Three minutes.

1217
01:11:22.974 --> 01:11:24.628
Who the fuck are these clowns?

1218
01:11:31.069 --> 01:11:32.244
Gonna be a problem?

1219
01:11:32.418 --> 01:11:33.724
I don't think so.

1220
01:11:34.464 --> 01:11:36.074
Five. on the car. Handle it.

1221
01:11:36.248 --> 01:11:37.249
On it.

1222
01:11:39.077 --> 01:11:40.383
Time to go to work. boys.

1223
01:11:42.776 --> 01:11:44.909
You gotta get
these hinges greased. Mick.

1224
01:11:50.131 --> 01:11:51.655
CHARLIE: What is this?

1225
01:11:59.706 --> 01:12:00.838
MICK: Freeway's
gonna be backed up.

1226
01:12:01.012 --> 01:12:02.013
CHARLIE: Oh. fuck!
MICK: Shit!

1227
01:12:04.668 --> 01:12:05.669
Let's go! Reverse! Reverse!

1228
01:12:14.895 --> 01:12:15.896
Unit 14. clear.

1229
01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:17.071
TOM: Still no response.

1230
01:12:23.556 --> 01:12:24.601
JAN: Thirty seconds.

1231
01:12:28.648 --> 01:12:30.694
SAM: Yo. out of

BRAD: They don't pay you
enough to act a fool. let's go.

1234
01:12:34.219 --> 01:12:35.176
Get your motherfucking
ass down.

1235
01:12:35.351 --> 01:12:36.743

JAN: Tires. now.

TOM: He shot
two fucking guards. Elvis.

1251
01:13:08.209 --> 01:13:09.385
He shot two fucking guards!

1252
01:13:09.559 --> 01:13:10.473
JACKSON: Number one.

1253
01:13:12.562 --> 01:13:14.172
Are we good.
number one?

1254
01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:15.826
We're good.

1255

TOM: Number one just shot
a fuckin' kid!

1256

He shot a fuckin' kid!

01:13:40.154 --> 01:13:41.982
SAM: What the fuck
did you just do?

1262
01:13:42.374 --> 01:13:43.941
JACKSON:
I said the fucking legs.

1263
01:13:44.115 --> 01:13:45.595
Three. take his gun.

1264
01:13:45.769 --> 01:13:46.683
Okay. we got one minute.

1265
01:13:46.987 --> 01:13:47.945
Let's go!

CARLOS:
B-team. let's go. let's go!

1270
01:14:36.297 --> 01:14:37.473
JAN: Gotta tell you. man.

1271
01:14:37.777 --> 01:14:39.475
Was surprised
to hear from you.

1272
01:14:39.649 --> 01:14:41.128
Glad we could all make it.

1273
01:14:42.739 --> 01:14:45.132
JAN: Yeah. I'm glad
that shit blew over.

1274
01:14:45.306 --> 01:14:46.960
JACKSON: You put us
in a tight spot. Jan.

1275
01:14:47.134 --> 01:14:49.267
I'm not sure
it has all blown over.

1276
01:14:49.789 --> 01:14:51.574
You're lucky you still got
a seat at this table.

1277
01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:54.881
Got it.

1278
01:14:59.538 --> 01:15:01.758
I think we all know we're
gonna need a pension fund.

1279
01:15:01.932 --> 01:15:03.977
I can't say I wasn't pleased
to have this meeting.

1280
01:15:04.151 --> 01:15:05.675
I was startin' to itch.

1281
01:15:05.849 --> 01:15:07.241
But as we are aware.

1282
01:15:07.415 --> 01:15:09.853
the bigger the reward.
the bigger the risk.

1283
01:15:10.331 --> 01:15:11.681
Everything comes at a price.

1284
01:15:11.855 --> 01:15:13.552
JACKSON:
Are you ready for that?

1285
01:15:13.726 --> 01:15:16.424
'Cause there is no guarantee
of success on this one.

1286
01:15:18.296 --> 01:15:20.733
None of this was ever really
guaranteed. was it. Sarge?

1287
01:15:22.953 --> 01:15:24.432
We've been through worse.

1288
01:15:24.737 --> 01:15:25.869
Yeah. so lay it on us.

1289
01:15:26.043 --> 01:15:27.348
We're dyin' to find out.

1290
01:15:28.175 --> 01:15:30.221
We do this right.

1291
01:15:30.917 --> 01:15:32.789
we'll never
have to work again.

1292
01:15:32.963 --> 01:15:34.225
Neither will our kids.

1293
01:15:34.399 --> 01:15:35.792
If we get it wrong?

1294
01:15:35.966 --> 01:15:37.750
It's game over.

1295
01:15:40.623 --> 01:15:42.363
So. what is it?

1296
01:15:44.801 --> 01:15:47.499
We're not hitting
a cash truck.

1297
01:15:47.673 --> 01:15:49.240
We're hitting them all.

1298
01:15:50.284 --> 01:15:51.547
How is that possible?

1299
01:15:52.809 --> 01:15:54.462
The depot.

1300
01:15:54.854 --> 01:15:55.899
Black Friday.

1301
01:15:59.293 --> 01:16:00.468
How much?

1302
01:16:01.295 --> 01:16:03.384
North of 150 million.

1303
01:16:03.733 --> 01:16:05.169
Ooh!

1304
01:16:09.434 --> 01:16:11.262
JACKSON: We've got eight weeks
of recon and planning.

1305
01:16:15.222 --> 01:16:17.834
Base. this is Gamma reportin'.

1306
01:16:24.231 --> 01:16:28.845
JOHN: Incoming vehicle.
Gamma 2411 to Bay 6.

1307
01:16:44.077 --> 01:16:47.733
That's 160 million
divided seven ways.

1308
01:16:48.212 --> 01:16:49.735
We have every avenue covered.

1309
01:16:49.909 --> 01:16:51.258
Incomin'. Mr. Rossi.

1310
01:16:51.432 --> 01:16:53.173
TERRY: Thank you. Mr. Hill.
Sign it in.

1311
01:16:53.347 --> 01:16:54.827
JACKSON:
This is our best plan.

1312
01:16:55.001 --> 01:16:56.742
Yeah.
All this is for nothing

1313
01:16:56.916 --> 01:16:58.526
if our guy
doesn't come through.

1314
01:16:59.092 --> 01:17:01.355
Why does this room
always smell so good?

1315
01:17:01.529 --> 01:17:03.488
Maybe one day.
my garden can smell like this.

1316
01:17:03.662 --> 01:17:05.925
I hope you're not
plannin' anything. Dave.

1317
01:17:06.099 --> 01:17:07.623
DAVE: Well. it's Black Friday
tomorrow.

1318
01:17:08.058 --> 01:17:09.668
so you'll have
to wait and see.

1319
01:17:09.842 --> 01:17:10.974
If I thought you were serious.

1320
01:17:11.148 --> 01:17:12.149
I'd have to report you.
you know.

1321
01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:13.977
'Course I'm not serious.

1322
01:17:14.151 --> 01:17:15.543
Or am I?

1323
01:17:17.023 --> 01:17:19.373
Anyway. it's Action Man
you gotta look out for.

1324
01:17:19.547 --> 01:17:20.505
not me.

1325
01:17:20.679 --> 01:17:22.420
Yeah. colder than a reptile.

1326
01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:24.901
Something's not right.

1327
01:17:25.075 --> 01:17:26.424
But why do I get the feeling

1328
01:17:26.598 --> 01:17:28.252
your money's never been safer.
Mr. Rossi?

1329
01:17:28.426 --> 01:17:29.949
JACKSON:
You don't need to worry.

1330
01:17:30.123 --> 01:17:31.647
He's greedier than you. Tom.
He'll come through.

1331
01:17:33.126 --> 01:17:34.824
Okay. let's run through it
one more time.

1332
01:17:39.219 --> 01:17:41.004
Has anyone seen my clutch?

1333
01:17:41.178 --> 01:17:42.266
Your... Your what?

1334
01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:43.789
My purse. sweetheart.

1335
01:17:43.963 --> 01:17:45.225
Uh. there's a green one
on the landing.

1336
01:17:45.399 --> 01:17:47.401
-Thank you. Lexie.
-Oh. yeah. Come on.

1337
01:17:47.575 --> 01:17:48.794
What are you doing today. Dad?

1338
01:17:48.968 --> 01:17:50.927
-Uh. I got work.
-At the mall?

1339
01:17:51.101 --> 01:17:52.276
JACKSON: That's right.

1340
01:17:52.450 --> 01:17:53.625
Will you come
to my game after?

1341
01:17:53.799 --> 01:17:55.453
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

1342
01:17:55.627 --> 01:17:56.759
-AMY: Okay. let's go!
-Come on. Mom. let's go.

1343
01:17:56.933 --> 01:17:58.064
-Love you. Dad!
-Bye. Love you!

1344
01:17:58.238 --> 01:17:59.631
-Bye. Dad!
-JACKSON: Love you.

1345
01:17:59.805 --> 01:18:00.414
AMY: Love you. honey.
JACKSON: I love you.

1346
01:18:00.588 --> 01:18:01.198
LEXIE: Come on!

1347
01:18:01.415 --> 01:18:02.286
JACKSON: Hey...

1348
01:18:03.287 --> 01:18:05.071
I'm gonna be late for work.

1349
01:18:05.245 --> 01:18:06.159
JACKSON: I love you.

1350
01:18:06.333 --> 01:18:07.726
LEXIE: Hurry up. Mom!

1351
01:18:08.553 --> 01:18:10.033
Okay. bye!

1352
01:18:11.556 --> 01:18:12.470
-Come on. kids.

1353
01:18:12.644 --> 01:18:13.732
get in the car!

1354
01:18:15.081 --> 01:18:17.083
-CAR ENGINE STARTS

1355
01:18:21.653 --> 01:18:22.872
Go.

1356
01:18:23.046 --> 01:18:24.656
JACKSON:
We're all set on our end.

1357
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:27.485
I'm on my way to pick up Jan.

1358
01:18:27.659 --> 01:18:29.530
Now. it's all up to you.

1359
01:18:32.098 --> 01:18:33.404
SUPER: Remember.

1360
01:18:33.578 --> 01:18:35.536
take different routes
there and back.

1361
01:18:35.711 --> 01:18:39.366
Even a sniff of anything
untoward and you call it in.

1362
01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:43.283
This is Black Friday. and
the tills will keep ringin'.

1363
01:18:43.457 --> 01:18:45.677
So. don't take no chances.

1364
01:18:45.851 --> 01:18:49.768
We got close to 180 million
comin' in here today.

1365
01:18:51.074 --> 01:18:52.945
-Have you got it?
-EMPLOYEES: Got it. boss!

1366
01:18:54.164 --> 01:18:57.558
I want everything
and everyone back.

1367
01:18:57.733 --> 01:18:59.604
Safe and sound.

1368
01:18:59.778 --> 01:19:01.562
BULLET: Let's get goin'. H.

1369
01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:11.442
JAN: What?

1370
01:19:12.008 --> 01:19:13.705
You don't like it?

1371
01:19:13.966 --> 01:19:17.100
How does someone like you
afford a place like this

1372
01:19:17.274 --> 01:19:19.798
and a $28.000 bike?

1373
01:19:20.668 --> 01:19:22.322
Credit card.

1374
01:19:22.627 --> 01:19:24.237
Calm down.
it's not in my name.

1375
01:19:24.411 --> 01:19:25.456
Return it.

1376
01:19:28.154 --> 01:19:30.330
Put the beers down.
grab your gear. and let's go.

1377
01:19:32.376 --> 01:19:33.769
Let's go!

1378
01:19:47.043 --> 01:19:48.131
BULLET:
That's the last drop-off.

1379
01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:10.675
-What is it?

1380
01:20:13.243 --> 01:20:15.201
You know I like you. right. H?

1381
01:20:18.552 --> 01:20:21.251
Well. there's somethin'
I need to tell you.

1382
01:20:21.425 --> 01:20:23.209
About me.

1383
01:20:25.124 --> 01:20:27.083
I've got some friends.

1384
01:20:27.953 --> 01:20:29.781
I help 'em out.

1385
01:20:30.956 --> 01:20:32.958
They help me out
from time to time.

1386
01:20:35.308 --> 01:20:36.614
My pals.

1387
01:20:37.571 --> 01:20:40.487
I helped 'em get
into the cash truck game.

1388
01:20:40.661 --> 01:20:42.489
in a manner of speaking.

1389
01:20:43.969 --> 01:20:45.841
With me on the inside.

1390
01:20:47.233 --> 01:20:48.539
You get me?

1391
01:20:50.541 --> 01:20:51.672
Nah. Bullet.

1392
01:20:53.370 --> 01:20:54.545
I don't.

1393
01:20:55.546 --> 01:20:57.940
I tell them
which trucks to hit

1394
01:20:58.766 --> 01:21:00.203
and they hit 'em.

1395
01:21:01.726 --> 01:21:04.468
The two guards being killed
was necessary.

1396
01:21:05.251 --> 01:21:07.340
The boy was unfortunate.

1397
01:21:09.038 --> 01:21:11.083
But we're a winning team.

1398
01:21:11.257 --> 01:21:13.433
Militarily precise.

1399
01:21:16.306 --> 01:21:18.177
You with me now?

1400
01:21:18.743 --> 01:21:20.005
Yeah.

1401
01:21:22.355 --> 01:21:24.836
I'm with you 100%.

1402
01:21:26.272 --> 01:21:27.752
Continue.

1403
01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:30.581
For starters. there are
no bullets in your gun.

1404
01:21:30.973 --> 01:21:32.583
Secondly. I have to tell you.

1405
01:21:32.757 --> 01:21:35.412
they will kill you
if you don't comply.

1406
01:21:35.586 --> 01:21:38.067
So. do as I say.
and you won't get hurt.

1407
01:21:41.635 --> 01:21:42.985
And why do you need me?

1408
01:21:43.463 --> 01:21:45.683
We need somethin' super-sized.

1409
01:21:46.510 --> 01:21:48.555
So we can walk away for good.

1410
01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:52.429
We want the jackpot.

1411
01:21:54.779 --> 01:21:56.607
The depot.

1412
01:21:57.695 --> 01:21:59.044
You want me to get you in.

1413
01:21:59.697 --> 01:22:01.960
Then you can look
the other way.

1414
01:22:04.615 --> 01:22:06.095
When. Bullet?

1415
01:22:07.923 --> 01:22:09.402
Today.

1416
01:22:10.882 --> 01:22:13.058
There's no turning back.

1417
01:22:14.842 --> 01:22:16.583
And what's in it for me?

1418
01:22:18.585 --> 01:22:19.586
Your life.

1419
01:22:25.679 --> 01:22:26.985
Do we have a deal?

1420
01:22:34.166 --> 01:22:35.428
Yeah.

1421
01:22:35.863 --> 01:22:37.126
We have a deal.

1422
01:22:42.566 --> 01:22:43.871
We're on. ETA. two minutes.

1423
01:22:44.046 --> 01:22:45.177
Covers.

1424
01:23:17.035 --> 01:23:19.211
JOHN: Gamma. this is Base.
you copy? Over.

1425
01:23:21.561 --> 01:23:23.520
Base. this is Gamma.
we copy. Over.

1426
01:23:23.694 --> 01:23:25.478
Gamma. I've lost
camera signal in your truck.

1427
01:23:25.652 --> 01:23:27.219
What's happenin' there? Over.

1428
01:23:27.393 --> 01:23:28.655
BULLET: It's nothing
to worry about. Base.

1429
01:23:28.829 --> 01:23:30.309
I'm fixin' it as we speak.

1430
01:23:30.483 --> 01:23:32.877
JOHN: Copy that. Gamma.
Keep me updated.

1431
01:23:33.051 --> 01:23:34.052
This ain't the day
for this shit.

1432
01:23:34.226 --> 01:23:35.532
you understand me? Over.

1433
01:23:35.706 --> 01:23:36.924
Loud and clear.

1434
01:23:37.099 --> 01:23:39.101
I'll be in touch as soon as.
Over.

1435
01:23:43.061 --> 01:23:44.367
We're set.

1436
01:23:44.541 --> 01:23:45.759
Cameras are disarmed.

1437
01:23:45.933 --> 01:23:48.936
We have four minutes to load.

1438
01:23:49.111 --> 01:23:50.982
JACKSON:
We meet here at point A.

1439
01:23:51.635 --> 01:23:53.593
Warn our hero
not to get clever.

1440
01:23:53.941 --> 01:23:55.247
We'll need him to get inside.

1441
01:23:55.421 --> 01:23:56.770
After that.
if he twitches. kill him.

1442
01:24:03.386 --> 01:24:05.779
Just let 'em do their jobs.
okay?

1443
01:24:05.953 --> 01:24:07.694
Let me talk to him.

1444
01:24:09.479 --> 01:24:11.089
-Hey. handsome.

1445
01:24:11.263 --> 01:24:14.962
Today is not the day
to be a hero.

1446
01:24:15.137 --> 01:24:17.182
There will be
no other warnings.

1447
01:24:17.617 --> 01:24:20.403
Am I clear?

1448
01:24:20.968 --> 01:24:23.058
Show me your hands.

1449
01:24:25.799 --> 01:24:27.366
BULLET: Play the game. H.

1450
01:24:45.993 --> 01:24:47.691
If you're a good boy today.

1451
01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:50.694
you'll see tomorrow.

1452
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:05.187
Then. we divide.

1453
01:25:05.361 --> 01:25:07.885
You. Brad. Carlos. and Jan
are in the truck.

1454
01:25:08.059 --> 01:25:10.148
Me and Sam
follow in the Escalade.

1455
01:25:37.958 --> 01:25:38.959
Be cool. H.

1456
01:25:39.438 --> 01:25:41.310
2411 returning.

1457
01:25:41.484 --> 01:25:43.616
Gamma. this is Base. go. Over.

1458
01:25:59.284 --> 01:26:00.720
All good?

1459
01:26:00.894 --> 01:26:02.069
Yeah. except for traffic.

1460
01:26:02.244 --> 01:26:03.288
DAVE: Dana.
come give me a hand.

1461
01:26:03.462 --> 01:26:05.247
-DANA: Yeah. no problem.
-Right.

1462
01:26:05.421 --> 01:26:07.074
Let's relieve you
of your burden.

1463
01:26:14.865 --> 01:26:16.954
Base. this is Gamma reporting.

1464
01:26:23.395 --> 01:26:24.657
All clear. Gamma.

1465
01:26:26.224 --> 01:26:27.225
You ready?

1466
01:26:28.618 --> 01:26:29.749
Ready.

1467
01:26:31.055 --> 01:26:33.666
Gamma 2411 to Bay 5.

1468
01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:35.190
That's the last one for today.

1469
01:26:35.364 --> 01:26:36.974
TOM: Once we get
past the gates.

1470
01:26:37.148 --> 01:26:38.715
it's only a question of time
before we're compromised.

1471
01:26:38.889 --> 01:26:40.673
There's too many guards
that we can't control.

1472
01:26:40.847 --> 01:26:42.762
so we keep it quiet
as long as possible.

1473
01:26:42.936 --> 01:26:44.721
JACKSON:
The men must be stealthy.

1474
01:26:44.895 --> 01:26:47.506
The longer their stealth. the
longer we live without drama.

1475
01:26:47.941 --> 01:26:49.813
Hey. Bullet. All good?

1476
01:26:49.987 --> 01:26:51.249
All good here. Supe.

1477
01:26:52.076 --> 01:26:54.948
Move. Move. Now. move! Go!

1478
01:26:55.122 --> 01:26:56.689
OFFICER: Whoa... Whoa.
JAN: Uh-uh-uh.

1479
01:26:56.863 --> 01:26:58.561
Don't you
fuckin' make a sound.

1480
01:26:58.735 --> 01:26:59.736
Down on the ground.

1481
01:26:59.910 --> 01:27:00.911
TOM: Move.

1482
01:27:01.694 --> 01:27:03.000
MAN: Okay. I'm down.

1483
01:27:03.957 --> 01:27:05.307
JACKSON:
Tiptoe. tiptoe. tiptoe.

1484
01:27:05.481 --> 01:27:07.178
We secure the safe first.

1485
01:27:07.352 --> 01:27:09.006
That's Carlos and Jan's job.

1486
01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:11.008
TERRY: Okay. Dave. that's
all good and accounted for.

1487
01:27:11.182 --> 01:27:12.401
CARLOS: Hands in the air!

1488
01:27:12.575 --> 01:27:13.880
Hands in
the motherfuckin' air!

1489
01:27:14.054 --> 01:27:14.968
Toss your weapons
on the ground.

1490
01:27:15.142 --> 01:27:16.187
Slowly. Slowly.

1491
01:27:16.361 --> 01:27:17.928
Do what he says.
Do what he says.

1492
01:27:18.102 --> 01:27:19.669
CARLOS: Take that weapon out.
Slide it over.

1493
01:27:19.843 --> 01:27:21.366
Get over there!
Get on the fuckin' ground!

1494
01:27:21.758 --> 01:27:23.194
The fuck is wrong with you?

1495
01:27:23.368 --> 01:27:24.717
Grab your gun.
put it on the ground.

1496
01:27:24.891 --> 01:27:26.545
and kick it to me.
motherfucker!

1497
01:27:26.719 --> 01:27:27.938
-TERRY: David. please.
-You wanna be a hero today?

1498
01:27:28.112 --> 01:27:29.766
I'll put you on the front page

1499
01:27:29.940 --> 01:27:31.158
of every fuckin' newspaper
in America. Try me.

1500
01:27:36.555 --> 01:27:37.600
Get on the ground.

1501
01:27:38.514 --> 01:27:39.515
All the way!

1502
01:27:40.690 --> 01:27:41.865
Get your fuckin' ass
on the ground!

1503
01:27:42.039 --> 01:27:43.432
Tie his ass up.

1504
01:27:49.525 --> 01:27:51.396
-JAN: Behave yourself.

1505
01:27:53.311 --> 01:27:55.008
-Hey.
-STUART: What's up?

1506
01:27:55.182 --> 01:27:57.402
Yo. I need you to sign this
birthday card for the boss.

1507
01:27:57.576 --> 01:27:59.012
Bring it up here
and have a look at this.

1508
01:27:59.186 --> 01:28:00.884
This will make you laugh.

1509
01:28:01.058 --> 01:28:02.929
JACKSON: You. Jan. and Brad
will take the control room.

1510
01:28:03.103 --> 01:28:05.280
-Bullet is hostage and shield.
-Shh.

1511
01:28:06.977 --> 01:28:08.370
If that doesn't work.
we blow our way in.

1512
01:28:09.675 --> 01:28:11.024
Keep it fucking quiet.

1513
01:28:16.508 --> 01:28:17.509
JAN: Open the gate.
MAN: Whoa.

1514
01:28:20.556 --> 01:28:21.557
ARMOURER: Bob?

1515
01:28:21.731 --> 01:28:23.733
What the fuck is goin' on?

1516
01:28:23.907 --> 01:28:25.561
JACKSON: The keypad
will present a challenge.

1517
01:28:25.735 --> 01:28:28.041
The men that operate
the armory are hard-boiled.

1518
01:28:28.215 --> 01:28:29.956
They will not be scared
of pulling the trigger.

1519
01:28:30.130 --> 01:28:31.262
At some point. they'll resist.

1520
01:28:31.828 --> 01:28:33.656
JAN: Open the gate.

1521
01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:35.788
or I'll blow
his fuckin' head off.

1522
01:28:36.441 --> 01:28:38.922
You have three seconds.

1523
01:28:39.096 --> 01:28:40.315
One!

1524
01:28:40.489 --> 01:28:42.360
Two! Three!

1525
01:28:42.534 --> 01:28:44.406
Okay! Putting the gun down!

1526
01:28:44.667 --> 01:28:45.798
JAN: Open the gate.

1527
01:28:45.972 --> 01:28:47.060
ARMOURER:
The keypad is out there.

1528
01:28:47.234 --> 01:28:48.584
JAN: You use the keypad.

1529
01:28:48.758 --> 01:28:50.063
ARMOURER:
It's on security lockdown!

1530
01:28:50.237 --> 01:28:52.109
You use the fuckin' keypad!

1531
01:28:53.284 --> 01:28:55.286
BRAD: The rabbits have run.

1532
01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:57.419
JAN: Two. breach the gate.

1533
01:28:57.593 --> 01:28:59.159
At some point. we're gonna
come under heavy fire.

1534
01:28:59.334 --> 01:29:00.770
They got long guns.
they're gonna use 'em.

1535
01:29:00.987 --> 01:29:02.902
Here you go.
Here. take this. chief.

1536
01:29:03.076 --> 01:29:04.295
So. we'll need
ballistic plates.

1537
01:29:04.469 --> 01:29:06.341
JAN: This is your last chance.

1538
01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:09.431
I'll blow his head off.

1539
01:29:09.605 --> 01:29:11.563
Bob. open the gate. or they're
gonna fuckin' kill me!

1540
01:29:11.737 --> 01:29:12.999
Bullet. get down!

1541
01:29:17.003 --> 01:29:18.265
Holy shit!

1542
01:29:20.616 --> 01:29:21.921
BRAD: Set!

1543
01:29:26.926 --> 01:29:28.101
CARLOS: Nobody fuckin' move!

01:29:28.275 --> 01:29:29.364
Number three. what's goin' on?

1545
01:29:32.367 --> 01:29:33.542
BRAD: Don't do it!

1546
01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:38.938
JOHN: Jesus fuckin' Christ!

1547
01:29:43.029 --> 01:29:44.161
ARMOURER: Now!

1548
01:29:55.390 --> 01:29:56.826
TOM: Move now! Move!

1549
01:30:21.807 --> 01:30:23.243

1550
01:30:23.418 --> 01:30:25.071
-TOM: Where are you hit?

1551
01:30:25.245 --> 01:30:26.246
Where are you hit?

1552
01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:30.033
Four is down.
Elvis. repeat. four is down.

JOHN: Oh. no! No. no. no!

No. Jesus.

1557
01:30:42.654 --> 01:30:45.048
JOHN: Please. don't.
I got kids. please. Please!

1558
01:30:45.222 --> 01:30:46.832
JAN: What do we
have here. huh? Motherfucker.

1559
01:30:47.006 --> 01:30:48.921
-JOHN: Don't hurt me! Please!
-

1560
01:30:49.095 --> 01:30:51.620
-

1561
01:30:51.794 --> 01:30:52.838
Enough of that.

1562
01:30:56.625 --> 01:30:58.801
Elvis. come and play.

1563
01:31:04.633 --> 01:31:06.461
...a bike from an open garage.

1564
01:31:06.635 --> 01:31:08.941
Officers have now located
the suspect and the bicycle...

1565
01:31:12.858 --> 01:31:14.947
JACKSON: One. sweep
the rest of the building.

1566
01:31:15.121 --> 01:31:16.166

TOM: Clear. Elvis. Move in.

1569
01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:31.486
Traffic
stopped on Highland and Third.

1570
01:31:34.619 --> 01:31:36.316
-CARLOS: Welcome to the party.

1571
01:31:37.187 --> 01:31:39.494
These three are hog-tied.
The guap is in here.

1572
01:31:40.190 --> 01:31:41.931
And another three guards
in the back.

JACKSON:
Once the alarm sounds.

1578
01:32:08.348 --> 01:32:10.742
black-and-whites will be
on scene within minutes.

1579
01:32:10.916 --> 01:32:12.614
but they cannot
enter the building.

1580
01:32:12.788 --> 01:32:14.964
Even if they could.
they wouldn't dare.

1581
01:32:15.138 --> 01:32:17.096
However.
they are not our problem.

1582
01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:20.186
We will have eight minutes
until SWAT arrives.

1583
01:32:23.015 --> 01:32:24.190
We can punch through
the black-and-whites

1584
01:32:24.364 --> 01:32:26.018
with an 18-ton cash truck.

1585
01:32:26.192 --> 01:32:27.759
but the SWAT truck's
a different story.

1586
01:32:27.933 --> 01:32:29.761
We cannot get pinned down.

1587
01:32:29.935 --> 01:32:32.111
We gotta get out
before they seal the exit.

1588
01:32:32.285 --> 01:32:34.200
We're eight minutes out.
Eight minutes out.

This is an emergency.

1591
01:32:37.508 --> 01:32:38.422
They have
heavy assault weapons.

1592
01:32:38.596 --> 01:32:40.119
and they have body armor.

1593
01:32:40.293 --> 01:32:41.773

-We're callin' SWAT!
-I'm not waiting for SWAT.

1597
01:32:46.343 --> 01:32:47.562

Shots have been fired!

Listen. the alarm's gone.
We should just wait for help.

1616
01:34:33.972 --> 01:34:36.018
What do you want us to do?

1617
01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:40.805

1677
01:40:46.866 --> 01:40:48.172
we punch through

1678
01:40:48.694 --> 01:40:50.087
Exit right.

1679
01:40:50.261 --> 01:40:52.872
They and the choppers
will be in pursuit.

1680
01:40:53.395 --> 01:40:55.440
but there's nothing
they can do to stop us.

1681
01:40:56.180 --> 01:40:58.182

Get ready.

JACKSON: We will have five
minutes until SWAT breaches.

1699
01:42:01.811 --> 01:42:03.421
They will think we're trapped.
They will shoot to kill.

1700
01:42:03.595 --> 01:42:04.857
but we won't be there.

1701
01:42:05.031 --> 01:42:06.381
And there's no way
that they can know

1702
01:42:06.555 --> 01:42:08.252

underneath the basement?

1703
01:42:08.426 --> 01:42:10.385

come up on any blueprints.

1704

Some of us won't make it.

If there is
a last man standing.

1727
01:43:46.611 --> 01:43:49.353
it's his job
to take care of the families.

that will happen.

1729

but my only concern is Jan.

1730
01:43:55.098 --> 01:43:57.361
Strange things happen to men

01:43:57.535 --> 01:43:59.624
when they smell
that much cash.

1732
01:44:00.538 --> 01:44:01.844
He's a soldier.
