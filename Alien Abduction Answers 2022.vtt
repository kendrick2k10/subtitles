00:00:11.171 --> 00:00:13.671
(eerie music)

4
00:00:29.846 --> 00:00:31.649
[John] I started lying almost 50 years ago

5
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.950
about what they did to me.

6
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.613
The government knows who they are.

7
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.253
It's time for both of us to tell the truth.

8
00:00:45.874 --> 00:00:48.374
(eerie music)

9
00:01:06.012 --> 00:01:08.349
(tap water running)

10
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.267
(door creaks open)

11
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.139
[Reporter] After decades of public denial.

12
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.363
the Pentagon now admits
there's something out there.

13
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.919
There's enough obvious evidence here

14
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.269
that we need to take this seriously

15
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.989
There are a lot more sightings
than have been made public.

16
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.309
We're talking about objects
that engage in actions

17
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.959
that are difficult to explain.

18
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.289
There's footage and records of objects

19
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.439
that we don't know exactly what they are.

20
00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.149
UAPs are real physical
objects and they're not ours.

21
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.983
[Luis] It is real.

22
00:02:00.984 --> 00:02:02.412
The question is. what is it?

23
00:02:02.413 --> 00:02:03.246
And how does it work?

24
00:02:03.246 --> 00:02:04.079
[George] They're not clouds.

25
00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:04.912
They're not birds.

26
00:02:04.913 --> 00:02:06.479
These are physical objects.

27
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.609
With no wings. no control
surfaces. no engines.

28
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.489
And yet somehow they're able to fly.

29
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.219
Pyramid shaped UFOs

30
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.959
and advanced trans medium
vehicles descending into the water

31
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.009
while swarming our Navy ships.

32
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.539
[Reporter] They outperform
some of the very best aircraft

33
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.709
that we have in our inventory.

34
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.639
Doesn't seem to be
any of our adversaries

35
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.559
or near peer technology.

36
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.909
Are we really dealing with something

37
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.309
that's a paradigm moment for our species.

38
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.949
[Don] What was as once
considered a joke is now seen

39
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.499
by a lot of people as a
genuine national security issue.

40
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.379
Who's operating these machines.

41
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.612
Why are they here?

42
00:02:41.613 --> 00:02:43.163
What do they want with us?

43
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.229
I understood it was a UFO.

44
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.939
It's rotating. and it's moving.
and it's moving closer.

45
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.309
And in that moment. in that instance.

46
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.229
ships started to pop up in the sky.

47
00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.699
The next thing I remember.
I was flying into a craft.

48
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.299
The last time that
they came to my room.

49
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.679
I was in my 20's.

50
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.769
I had three beings standing there.

51
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.519
And the being was
right next to my face.

52
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.299
And all I could see was it's face.

53
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.929
He saw two shadow beings
walking through our hallway

54
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.689
and going down the stairs.

55
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.309
And I knew I was dealing

56
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.439
with lots of different types of beings.

57
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.149
Oh my gosh. this is not a dream.

58
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.672
Who's crazy now?

59
00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:28.019
You all thought I was crazy.

60
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.853
Who's crazy now?

61
00:03:28.853 --> 00:03:29.853
Who can explain it?

62
00:03:35.847 --> 00:03:38.347
(eerie music)

63
00:03:53.445 --> 00:03:56.367
Well. this is where it all began.

64
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:02.441
I haven't been back
here for almost 40 years.

65
00:04:06.773 --> 00:04:08.453
I'll tell you. if this house could talk.

66
00:04:41.127 --> 00:04:43.627
(eerie music)

67
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.219
Something is happening. it's undeniable.

68
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.339
There are too many people

69
00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.729
from all around the world
saying the same things.

70
00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.989
Abductions have been
recorded since the 1920's.

71
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.358
but there's really no
way to know for certain

72
00:05:04.359 --> 00:05:06.343
how long this has been going on.

73
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.550
This subject has been
taboo for such a long time

74
00:05:15.411 --> 00:05:19.729
and been researched by many.
many people behind the scenes.

75
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.199
In the '80s. there was a
man who was brave enough

76
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.200
to come out in public and
catalog his own experiences.

77
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.429
There's no one more prolific

78
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.963
in this area than Whitley Strieber.

79
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.119
Many people know
Whitley Strieber as an author

80
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.120
and a speaker.

81
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:42.970
He's so much more than that.

82
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.640
He is a true philosopher
and thought leader in this field.

83
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.159
What is actually there

84
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.009
and what you're seeing may
be two entirely different things.

85
00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.369
The result of this has been that we build

86
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.919
what amount to kind of folklores.

87
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.656
And I don't mean things
that are dreamed up.

88
00:06:07.657 --> 00:06:12.657
Folklore comes not from
imagination and dreams only.

89
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.860
It also comes from perceptions
that we can't understand.

90
00:06:19.667 --> 00:06:21.729
"Fairy lore" of Northern Europe

91
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.339
is a perfect example of this.

92
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.972
This lore in the 17th. 18th
and early 19th centuries

93
00:06:28.973 --> 00:06:32.639
was very ominous and frightening.

94
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.733
And if you went with them.
you might not come back.

95
00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.999
That was the way that world saw this.

96
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
It had no idea of galaxies.
no idea of the actual immensity

97
00:06:46.907 --> 00:06:48.979
of just the physical universe.

98
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.899
and certainly no concept

99
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.879
that there could be very
real parallel universes

100
00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.709
that might be capable
of interacting with this.

101
00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.947
Now. comes the 1940's.

102
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.709
We are aware of outer space.

103
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:04.929
We've thought about aliens

104
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.419
and suddenly they show up.

105
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.469
And what do we think now?

106
00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.799
The fairy folk of the 19th

107
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.529
and 18th centuries become
the visitors and the aliens

108
00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:17.923
of the 20th century.

109
00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:25.329
I am here to discuss the
so-called flying saucers.

110
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:26.469
The air force interest

111
00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:30.169
in this problem has been due
to our feeling of an obligation

112
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:34.259
to identify and analyze to
the best of our ability anything

113
00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:38.239
in the air that may have the
possibility of threat or menace

114
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.809
to the United States.

115
00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:42.209
The U.S. government
has been and studying UFOs

116
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.349
for a very long time.

117
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:45.649
As scientific advisor

118
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:49.659
to the U.S Air Force under
project Sign and Blue Book.

119
00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:54.339
Professor Joseph Allen Hynek
applied the same discipline

120
00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.369
that he used to achieve
his astrophysics PhD

121
00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.796
to the study of this phenomena.

122
00:07:59.797 --> 00:08:02.629
The panel had deliberately moved

123
00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:04.941
to debunk the whole subject

124
00:08:04.942 --> 00:08:09.299
and not to give it the
serious scientific attention

125
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.033
which it deserved.

126
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.482
[John] Later. he would develop
the classification system

127
00:08:14.483 --> 00:08:16.539
that has been adopted worldwide

128
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:20.393
to scientifically examine each
aspect of these encounters.

129
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:25.699
Close encounters of the first
kind involve a visual sighting

130
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.700
of a UFO.

131
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.999
Close encounters of the second kind

132
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.429
leave physical trace
evidence of the experience.

133
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:38.709
a burn mark from the craft.

134
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:41.809
material left behind
after the craft departed.

135
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:46.339
radioactivity. or even an
unusual discomfort experienced

136
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.703
by an individual in the
form of a physiological effect.

137
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.899
Close encounters of the third kind center

138
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:57.709
on the siting of actual entities
associated with the UFO.

139
00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:59.759
These entities usually seem ignorant

140
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.289
of the human beings
watching their activities.

141
00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:06.499
On those occasions where the
UFO occupants do take notice

142
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.519
of their human observers.

143
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.929
that leads us to consider close encounters

144
00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:12.629
of the fourth kind.

145
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:16.099
which contain any
interaction between humans

146
00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.479
and entities associated
with the UFO sighting.

147
00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.429
These include actual
abductions of human beings.

148
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:24.300
Just like most people.

149
00:09:24.301 --> 00:09:27.809
I had no idea that this subject
was being taken so seriously

150
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:31.299
by some of the most
powerful people in the world.

151
00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.059
[Reporter] Lawmakers from
both political parties say

152
00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.669
it is time to determine whether
the objects pose a threat

153
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:39.239
to the U.S.

154
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.679
There's stuff flying in our airspace.

155
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.839
We don't know what it is.

156
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.140
We need to find out.
that's my position on it.

157
00:09:47.949 --> 00:09:49.681
[John] It was only
after I finally realized

158
00:09:49.682 --> 00:09:53.769
and admitted to everyone that I. in fact

159
00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:56.169
had a close encounter of the fourth kind

160
00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:57.939
that I started to study the subject

161
00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.149
and was overwhelmed by the amount of people

162
00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:04.033
who had had a similar experience to me.

163
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.609
Incredible as it seems.
these abductions of people

164
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:10.359
have been recorded throughout history

165
00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.759
and are documented as far
back as the Old Testament.

166
00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:14.909
Most folks are familiar

167
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:17.529
with the fiery chariots of the Bible.

168
00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:18.460
but as far as I could tell.

169
00:10:18.461 --> 00:10:21.609
the modern focus on alien abduction started

170
00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:23.769
in the late 1950's.

171
00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:27.349
[Announcer] Invaders from
Mars. capturing humans at will

172
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.149
for their own sinister purposes.

173
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.949
There have been a certain
percentage of this volume

174
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:36.480
of reports that have been
made by credible observers

175
00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.533
of relatively incredible things.

176
00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:43.856
[John] For example. October. 1957.

177
00:10:43.857 --> 00:10:48.857
a 23 year old Brazilian farmer
named Antonio Vilas Boaz

178
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:50.209
was ploughing his fields at night

179
00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:54.153
when he noticed a red star
growing rapidly in the night sky.

180
00:10:55.260 --> 00:11:00.259
The star approached him
taking the form of a spacecraft.

181
00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.319
His escape was prevented
by three extraterrestrials

182
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.773
who pulled him into that spacecraft.

183
00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.429
In September. 1961.

184
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.899
one of the most famous
alien abductions occurred

185
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.373
in Lancaster. New Hampshire.

186
00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.699
At about 10:30 that night.

187
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.839
Betty and Barney Hill
observed a bright light in the sky

188
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.593
while driving home from vacation.

189
00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.049
[John] In October. 1973. two
fisherman. Charlie Hickson

190
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:43.379
and Calvin Parker reported
to local law enforcement

191
00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:47.859
of being abducted by robot-like
aliens while night fishing

192
00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:50.709
on the Pascagoula river in Mississippi.

193
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:54.509
It landed behind this
and we turned around.

194
00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:56.219
stood up and turned around and looked

195
00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:58.693
and must have been a door that opened

196
00:11:58.694 --> 00:12:00.362
where all the bright lights come out of it.

197
00:12:00.363 --> 00:12:03.849
I seen three bulky looking
creatures coming toward us.

198
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.179
So two of 'em got a hold of Charlie.

199
00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.689
One of 'em got a hold of myself

200
00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:11.249
and the old big. ugly
creature that brought me in.

201
00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:14.483
he took me and laid
me on examination table.

202
00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:22.099
[John] January. 1976. three
women driving home one evening

203
00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.529
encountered a craft that
seemed to be following their car

204
00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:27.669
in Stanford. Kentucky.

205
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:30.109
They tried in vain to
get away from the craft.

206
00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:31.309
but it centered in on them

207
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:34.309
and took control of their vehicle.

208
00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:47.259
[John] The women escaped the car.

209
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.829
but they all recount
that they were abducted

210
00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:52.053
and taken up into the craft.

211
00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:05.129
[John] Terry Lovelace was
on a camping trip with a friend

212
00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:08.889
in Devil's Den Sate Park
when both of them looked up

213
00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:12.399
and noticed some unusual.
bright lights in the sky.

214
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.819
The lights formed into a craft

215
00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.813
and hovered 30 feet over them.

216
00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:20.499
They were taken too.

217
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.333
[Terry] I don't think

218
00:13:21.334 --> 00:13:23.669
these things really intended hurt us.

219
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:28.670
They took us inside of this
craft incredibly brightly lit.

220
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:31.119
And I think that's why I came out of this

221
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.669
with a severe sunburn.

222
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:35.849
I had burns everywhere.

223
00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:39.469
Afterward. we calculated
that we had been out probably

224
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:40.549
about four hours.

225
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:43.153
There are a lot of crazy things out there.

226
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.889
This list is almost endless.

227
00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:47.073
It goes on and on.

228
00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.389
It gave me some comfort
to know that I was not alone.

229
00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:54.689
Other people. lots of
them from all walks of life

230
00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:58.779
have experienced being
helplessly removed from their homes.

231
00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.297
from their cars and everything else

232
00:14:01.298 --> 00:14:03.133
that they considered reality.

233
00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:08.253
But it also pointed out
that I was no one special.

234
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:15.013
Funny. but that was the thing
that calmed me most of all.

235
00:14:15.972 --> 00:14:17.649
This entire film is an attempt

236
00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:21.209
to have the audience see the
phenomena through my eyes

237
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:25.488
as I grapple with the truth.
understand what it might mean

238
00:14:25.489 --> 00:14:27.123
and then try to live it.

239
00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.479
I wanted to ask the questions
that people are afraid to ask

240
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:35.196
and get meaningful answers
that would unify experiencers

241
00:14:35.197 --> 00:14:38.220
and folks that had no
idea this was going on

242
00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:42.299
so that we could all face
what is speeding toward us

243
00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.933
as one people together.

244
00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:48.103
I felt alone.

245
00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.899
I was looking for some
encouragement. some solace.

246
00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:57.900
I was amazed to find out how
many hundreds of thousands

247
00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.519
of people have claimed contact.

248
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.899
And I'm not talking about
shiny lights in the sky.

249
00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:09.929
I'm talking about an
entity right beside you

250
00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:11.580
because that's a different thing.

251
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:16.740
I found out that there were
people all around the country

252
00:15:16.741 --> 00:15:19.973
that would get together
and share their experiences.

253
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.709
When I got to Big Arb.

254
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:36.508
I was blown away by how beautiful it was.

255
00:15:36.509 --> 00:15:39.739
but more so how beautiful those people were

256
00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.573
and how giving and honest they were.

257
00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:49.399
Each one of them had had a
different type of experience.

258
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.893
They were all otherworldly.

259
00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:52.870
They were strange.

260
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:53.820
They were different.

261
00:15:53.821 --> 00:15:55.619
They were different than mine.

262
00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.588
I kind of thought that
everything would be the same.

263
00:15:57.589 --> 00:15:58.979
but the truth

264
00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:01.863
is they came in every
different shape and size.

265
00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:07.883
I'm Kimberly Marie. and I
am a lifelong experiencer.

266
00:16:08.944 --> 00:16:11.479
I'm an Intuitive Empath.

267
00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:15.819
I'm a Yogi of 30 years and I'm a mother.

268
00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:20.123
I have two daughters
and I'm a spiritual seeker.

269
00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.549
The earliest experience that I remember.

270
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:26.463
I was in grade school.

271
00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:30.803
I had this feeling that
I was being watched.

272
00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:33.439
I would get up in the middle of the night

273
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.839
and I would look out at the woods.

274
00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:40.049
And I had a very acute
awareness that there was something

275
00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:42.013
in those woods that was watching me.

276
00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:47.779
I also had experiences
having beings in my room.

277
00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:48.720
There would be one being.

278
00:16:48.721 --> 00:16:52.519
and it would be just sitting
there quietly watching me.

279
00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.389
I would feel impressions on my bed

280
00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:56.759
as if somebody was coming
to sit on the end of my bed

281
00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.029
or next to me.

282
00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:01.893
I felt the presence of
somebody sitting in my car

283
00:17:01.894 --> 00:17:03.749
or walking behind me.

284
00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:05.589
I could feel their breath.

285
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:09.459
I was having experiences
that were unexplainable.

286
00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.163
They don't just come to everyone.

287
00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:35.249
I decided to call these entities

288
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:39.559
that I was engaging with visitors

289
00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:44.560
because I thought that the
word aliens was a step too far.

290
00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:47.529
Are they entities as they appear

291
00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:49.699
or is it some kind of a phenomenon

292
00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:53.129
that projects itself into us?

293
00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:55.239
Has it been here forever?

294
00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:58.519
Maybe from the beginning of time even?

295
00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:02.059
One thing they certainly
are. are visitors in the lives

296
00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:03.723
of those who encounter them.

297
00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:11.149
I'm Alanna. and I'm
just an average person.

298
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:15.759
but I've come to realize
that I'm also an experiencer.

299
00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.129
I was living on my grandparents' farm.

300
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:22.489
I was just a little girl when
I had my first experience.

301
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:25.269
I was in a completely black space

302
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:29.859
and I was standing beside
what you would call a gray alien.

303
00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:34.860
It's about my size. gray.
large almond shaped eyes.

304
00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.010
I'm a bit alarmed

305
00:19:36.011 --> 00:19:38.969
because it's nothing I've ever seen before.

306
00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:43.609
Suddenly. I realized I'm laying
back in my bed. motionless

307
00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:47.499
and I'm looking up and the
being is just looking at me.

308
00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:50.329
And as I'm lying there.

309
00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:54.229
the being space is changing
into the photo of the white cat

310
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:55.110
on my wall.

311
00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:56.519
It was nothing I'd ever seen before.

312
00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:59.143
I'd never seen a being like that.

313
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:01.440
I'm Melissa Cain.

314
00:20:01.441 --> 00:20:03.969
I am a doting wife and a mother of three

315
00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:05.519
and three fur babies as well.

316
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.192
And I'm a business owner.

317
00:20:07.193 --> 00:20:11.549
Unlike my friends. and
other people. and books

318
00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:13.739
that I've read and movies
that I've seen about people

319
00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:18.469
who have contact. they see
beings. they see giant craft.

320
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:20.149
I never had any of that.

321
00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:22.749
At a very young age. I
would see in the middle

322
00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:25.519
of the night are scenes flying

323
00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:28.609
by me like movies. really fast.

324
00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:29.799
I could never slow 'em down.

325
00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.229
I could never see what was happening.

326
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.349
I couldn't stop them to see

327
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:34.969
what I was supposed to be looking at.

328
00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:37.670
And it was terrifying because
I couldn't slow it down.

329
00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:41.419
After the scenes would be flying by me.

330
00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:43.029
I would see a gray screen

331
00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:45.869
and there would be a thin
line going through the middle

332
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.869
of it. kind of like a heartbeat type line.

333
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:52.359
And when that cord
was straight. I was safe.

334
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.779
But when that cord
kind of crunched together

335
00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.919
and would wave up and down.

336
00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.909
that's when I felt like I
was losing my breath

337
00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:00.229
and I was gonna die.

338
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:01.629
These kind of faded away

339
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:04.179
when I was kind of reaching middle school.

340
00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.899
but it did for many. many
years make me afraid

341
00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:08.100
to go to sleep at night.

342
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:12.619
Screen memories in
the contact experience

343
00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:14.730
have two purposes.

344
00:21:14.731 --> 00:21:18.609
One is to shield the
individual from a memory

345
00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.919
that they can't bear.

346
00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.359
Two is it's a test.

347
00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.839
Are you gonna break
through the screen memory?

348
00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.579
Can you bear it after all?

349
00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:31.729
So the screen memory has two purposes.

350
00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:33.439
It is to let you off the hook

351
00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.510
if your soul does not
want to engage in contact.

352
00:21:36.511 --> 00:21:38.814
and it is there to be broken down

353
00:21:38.815 --> 00:21:42.133
if you do want to make that step.

354
00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:46.770
I'm Stacy McArdle
and I'm from Illinois

355
00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:52.049
and I'm an experiencer. and a seeker.

356
00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:54.690
and I'm just full of wonderment.

357
00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.369
From a very young age. I just had a knowing

358
00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:01.449
that I came from another place.

359
00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:04.809
I had been telepathically
communicating with beings

360
00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:07.893
from other planets ever
since I could remember.

361
00:22:08.917 --> 00:22:13.917
I had memories of being in a
room. getting ready to be born

362
00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:16.419
before I came to this planet.

363
00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:19.149
before I was in my mom's stomach.

364
00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:22.069
I was in this nondescript room

365
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:27.070
with everything from human
spirits. to elementals. to ETs.

366
00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.931
We were called to this
gentleman that was manning a door

367
00:22:31.932 --> 00:22:34.653
and we all lined up and he opened the door

368
00:22:34.654 --> 00:22:37.479
and all this sunlight flooded in

369
00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.729
and we were on top of a mountain.

370
00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:43.419
There were two rivers with
a strip of land in between.

371
00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:46.904
jumping into that river meant
you were gonna be born soon.

372
00:22:46.905 --> 00:22:50.369
I was immersed in the
water and it was crystal clear

373
00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:51.779
and there were colored fish.

374
00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:54.319
And all the plant life
was very vibrantly colored

375
00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:58.819
and all of a sudden this
human-size fish shows up next to me

376
00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.619
and he's telepathically
communicating with me.

377
00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:04.319
He was telling me what to expect
and what was gonna happen.

378
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.139
I knew I was gonna go to another planet.

379
00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:08.114
I knew who my mother was going to be.

380
00:23:08.115 --> 00:23:11.079
And then all of a sudden I was born.

381
00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.479
Over the years. more puzzle pieces

382
00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.839
from that memory come
together and solidify it.

383
00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:20.593
So I always knew that I
came from another planet.

384
00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:24.829
I'm Jan Jander.

385
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:26.499
I'm a Designer by trade.

386
00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.723
and I'm also an experiencer.

387
00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:33.839
My first experience that I
remember. I was seven years old

388
00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.879
and we were on a flight to the Philippines.

389
00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.799
The sun was coming up and I
was just glued to the window.

390
00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.099
When my gaze shifted up to the horizon.

391
00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:46.669
boom. out of thin air is a
classic UFO. like a saucer.

392
00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:49.989
It was as if the whole
thing was made out of metal

393
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:51.959
that was highly reflective.

394
00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.649
I could tell that it had a slight rotation.

395
00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:57.379
Shortly thereafter. it just zipped.

396
00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:02.259
It just instantaneous
acceleration. but just so fast.

397
00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.019
It lit a fire in me

398
00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:07.349
that continued through elementary school.

399
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:10.869
Most people hadn't had a UFO experience.

400
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:14.169
And so I was kind of alone in that.

401
00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:16.509
I believed it and I knew it was true.

402
00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:19.909
but my dad showed me the "Condon Report".

403
00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:23.269
And when they concluded
that there was nothing to it.

404
00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:27.609
I knew with everything in
me that that report was wrong.

405
00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:31.189
Right around when I had the UFO experience.

406
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:32.359
I had gone to bed.

407
00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.329
At some point. I woke up
in the middle of the night

408
00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:37.759
and when I looked at the
corner. my room was illuminated.

409
00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.953
I tilt outta bed. and there
he is. the popcorn man.

410
00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:43.669
And he is on a bicycle.

411
00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:45.199
There's this giant popcorn.

412
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.529
It's like two big popcorn containers

413
00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:50.239
hanging off the front wheel.

414
00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:53.629
And everything is
covered in this thin vertical.

415
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:55.719
yellow and red stripes.

416
00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.409
He had a straw hat and on it was a ribbon.

417
00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:01.469
He had a tie. a vest. three-piece-suit.

418
00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:06.289
And his skin was white
like a clown. curly black hair.

419
00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:08.669
He had weird blue eyes.

420
00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:10.799
The whole. where your eyeball would be

421
00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.699
was this glowing baby blue light.

422
00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:15.919
He was very. very skinny.

423
00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.839
I guessed. he was like seven.
seven and a half feet tall.

424
00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.079
And I am completely stunned.

425
00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:26.080
I freeze. and I'm like this. what. no!

426
00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:31.309
And eventually. he slowly.
his head started to turn.

427
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:32.250
He started to turn.

428
00:25:32.251 --> 00:25:34.789
I knew he was coming in my direction.

429
00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:36.689
The last thing I remember of the experience

430
00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:39.669
is when he made eye contact
with me and then it was gone.

431
00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:40.503
It was game over.

432
00:25:40.504 --> 00:25:43.439
And I don't even know what happened.

433
00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:46.119
That was the end of the memory.

434
00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:51.120
In order to think clearly
about what we are seeing.

435
00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:55.889
the place we have to
go is to the brain itself.

436
00:25:55.890 --> 00:26:00.890
It organizes these perceptions into forms

437
00:26:01.359 --> 00:26:04.753
that the mind can then evaluate.

438
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:10.630
But if you have no way at
all from your past of relating it

439
00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:13.729
to anything. you're going to build it

440
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:15.819
out of your imagination.

441
00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:20.159
And even though it's
there. what is actually there

442
00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:23.289
and what you're seeing may
to entirely different things.

443
00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:24.803
and you can't tell.

444
00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:29.849
My name is Ruth and I'm
from Wisconsin. West Central

445
00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:30.939
to be more specific.

446
00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:32.623
I live in a rural area.

447
00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:38.610
My first experience. I
remember seeing stars.

448
00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.629
beautiful stars in the ceiling.

449
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:45.169
The stars made me feel
full of wonder I guess.

450
00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:46.439
I started to realize

451
00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:51.189
that it wasn't what it was appearing to be.

452
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:53.223
Then I started to become more afraid.

453
00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:59.340
I remember floating up above
my bed. up above the house.

454
00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:04.799
I was kind of flying and I knew
that I was going someplace.

455
00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:05.909
I couldn't see the craft.

456
00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:07.659
I believe it must have been cloaked.

457
00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:09.379
but I knew it was above me.

458
00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:11.713
And I knew I was going into it.

459
00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.729
I must have gotten some communication

460
00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:20.379
because I knew what I was supposed to do.

461
00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:24.179
I mean. when I went from the
waiting room to the exam table.

462
00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.539
I knew I was supposed to do this.

463
00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:29.616
Either I thought it. or I
actually said the words.

464
00:27:29.617 --> 00:27:33.249
"Ruth. this is not a dream. this is real."

465
00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:35.833
Then I was back in my
bed and it was all done.

466
00:27:41.622 --> 00:27:44.122
(eerie music)

467
00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:01.459
[John] I'm always amazed when someone says

468
00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:03.169
that they have all of the answers

469
00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:05.879
about who the ET visitors are

470
00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.999
and the nature of their agendas.

471
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.636
I wonder. "How can that possibly be?"

472
00:28:11.637 --> 00:28:15.663
Take for example. Earthlings
quest to land on Mars.

473
00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:20.869
Just suppose the crew was
made up of someone from Africa.

474
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:24.420
China. Germany. and Scandinavia.

475
00:28:24.421 --> 00:28:26.099
If there were Martians

476
00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:28.399
and they came out to greet these visitors.

477
00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:32.069
could they identify the
true. extraterrestrial?

478
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:35.079
Because of these visitors'
genetics and evolution.

479
00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:37.429
they all look drastically different.

480
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:42.119
In addition to that. they might
all have different agendas.

481
00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:46.749
scientific advancement. military conquest.

482
00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:50.933
industrial development.
or peaceful exploration.

483
00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:56.783
and all of that in one
spaceship from one planet!

484
00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:01.209
If we accept that life is
prolific in the universe

485
00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:03.069
and that we're being visited.

486
00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:06.763
there is no way to know
everything about every one of them.

487
00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:11.983
They all cannot be evil
child-eating monsters.

488
00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:14.589
And by the same token.

489
00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:19.129
they cannot all be ultra
spiritual benevolent beings.

490
00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:21.259
I mean hell. look at us.

491
00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:23.959
we've got a lot of work
to do on our altruism

492
00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.810
and we're traveling to other planets!

493
00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:31.393
To the Martians in our
little fable. we're the aliens.

494
00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:50.490
In October of 1985. things
began to change in our life.

495
00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:56.639
There was an unusual event that took place

496
00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:59.699
at the little cabin in upstate New York.

497
00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:02.059
All of a sudden in the middle of the night.

498
00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:04.773
the whole place lit up like daylight.

499
00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:11.693
And I noted there was a great bang.

500
00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:16.069
I opened my eyes
immediately because of the cries

501
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:18.319
of my son downstairs.

502
00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.459
The light was pouring in the windows.

503
00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:24.723
but by the time I'd gotten
downstairs. the light was gone.

504
00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.099
but I got a shotgun and I got a pistol.

505
00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:32.079
I got an alarm system.

506
00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.309
I could literally not sleep a night

507
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:36.939
in that house without that alarm system.

508
00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:41.940
And I found myself patrolling
the area with the shotgun.

509
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:45.853
I became aware of a presence near me.

510
00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:50.049
And that was the
beginning of a real dissent.

511
00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:51.673
almost into madness.

512
00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:56.974
The fear that's connected
with this is the same fear

513
00:30:56.975 --> 00:31:00.739
that a wild animal
feels when it's captured.

514
00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:04.779
We will attack if cornered.
we will run if we can.

515
00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:08.509
And when it does happen
to us. and it overwhelms us.

516
00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:12.889
and devastates our egos.
and leaves us in a situation

517
00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:16.159
of helplessness in the
hands of the unknown.

518
00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:20.273
we will as often as not
simply bury that memory.

519
00:31:31.103 --> 00:31:33.179
(door creaks open)

520
00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:34.740
It's taken me a long time

521
00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.469
to be able to talk about this

522
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:43.470
because it's been so bizarre.
and strange and unbelievable.

523
00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:46.023
And also because I was told not to.

524
00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:52.860
Some really big-hearted
friends who knew about this

525
00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:56.573
and knew that something just wasn't right.

526
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:59.469
And through many discussions.

527
00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:03.959
I finally was able to come to terms with it

528
00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:07.049
and admit it in public.

529
00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:08.300
And that was really hard.

530
00:32:10.757 --> 00:32:15.757
I was seven years old
and I was in my bedroom

531
00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:19.019
and it was in the middle of the night.

532
00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:22.939
And I awoke to hear this drone.

533
00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:25.089
So I rolled outta bed
and I decided I would go

534
00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:26.090
to the bathroom.

535
00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.517
I walk into the bathroom
and I shut the door

536
00:32:29.518 --> 00:32:31.909
and I turn on the water.

537
00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:34.270
I was just looking at the water.

538
00:32:34.271 --> 00:32:36.479
And I stood there for a long time.

539
00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.640
And then I turned off the
water and I moved to my right

540
00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:43.759
and I opened up the bathroom door.

541
00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.439
And when I did.

542
00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:50.440
I was face to face with to what
my mind said was Ultraman.

543
00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:58.649
Ultraman was this character
in Japanese television.

544
00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:01.959
And he was a silver
guy with these huge eyes.

545
00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:06.960
To my seven year old mind. I
was looking at that character.

546
00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.179
but we got very. very close.

547
00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:12.319
So I was eye to eye with him.

548
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.749
He was no bigger than I was.

549
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:18.109
And as he drew closer to me.

550
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:23.110
I could feel myself being
pulled and I got afraid.

551
00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.319
I was terrified.

552
00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:30.999
And just then. there was
this huge flash of light.

553
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.199
and there was this speeding.
kaleidoscope of lights.

554
00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.236
And I felt cold. but I
didn't know where I was

555
00:33:37.237 --> 00:33:38.369
and what was going on.

556
00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:41.869
It felt like I was traveling.
but I was unsure.

557
00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:45.999
But then I was standing
again in that small hallway

558
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.849
with this entity.

559
00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:51.889
But now this entity's
back was in the bathroom.

560
00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:56.529
And my back was facing the hardwood stairs

561
00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:58.099
that were behind me.

562
00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:01.939
I can see him raise his right hand.

563
00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:04.629
There is a brilliant flash of light.

564
00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:08.053
and I felt the impact on
my shoulder. and I fell.

565
00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:13.459
And I landed at the bottom of these stairs.

566
00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:16.839
And I heard my father
scream. "What the hell is that?"

567
00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:17.979
And my mother came out

568
00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:20.849
and they came to see their son sprawled.

569
00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:25.239
And I am saying. "Ultraman
is in my room. he's upstairs!"

570
00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:29.589
I'm screaming. and my
father looks at me. he's upset.

571
00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:31.649
And he bounds up the stairs.

572
00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:34.209
He went room to room and opened doors.

573
00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:36.339
And he came to the top of the stairs.

574
00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:37.419
He looked down.

575
00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:41.949
And I'm crying and he looked disappointed.

576
00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:44.349
maybe even a little disgusted.

577
00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:45.959
My father kind of gives my mother a look

578
00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:50.960
like don't make a baby out of
this kid. walked me upstairs.

579
00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:53.541
And they did what parents do.

580
00:34:53.542 --> 00:34:57.169
You look under the bed.
"See. there's nothing there."

581
00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:59.599
My mom gives me a kiss on my forehead.

582
00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.400
tells me everything's gonna be okay.

583
00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:07.419
A day later. my mom is telling
me that it's time for a bath.

584
00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:08.689
So she took my t-shirt off.

585
00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:11.449
And she said. "Honey. what's this?".

586
00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:14.626
kinda like looking around to
make sure my dad wasn't around.

587
00:35:14.627 --> 00:35:17.737
"Well. I told you mom that
Ultraman was in my bedroom."

588
00:35:18.876 --> 00:35:19.800
A couple of days later.

589
00:35:19.801 --> 00:35:22.999
my father was taking me to the doctor.

590
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.436
And as we're pulling in. he said to me.

591
00:35:24.437 --> 00:35:25.956
"Hey. listen. I don't wanna hear any

592
00:35:25.957 --> 00:35:28.326
"of this Ultraman bullshit.

593
00:35:28.327 --> 00:35:30.289
"You keep that to yourself."

594
00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:34.149
Doctor gave me an exam.
asked me about my shoulder.

595
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:38.189
Man. I saw my father. he was glaring at me.

596
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:43.190
So I said. "I don't know.
I was just out playin'."

597
00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:44.799
And as I was walking out in the hall.

598
00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.379
I still remember him talking to my father

599
00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:49.099
in hush tones saying something

600
00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:52.993
about some sort of a scar
brought on by intense heat.

601
00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:55.819
So I never thought about it again.

602
00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:58.548
And my father said to me.

603
00:35:58.549 --> 00:36:00.536
"Just keep that to yourself.

604
00:36:00.537 --> 00:36:01.924
"Don't say anything.

605
00:36:01.925 --> 00:36:03.429
"I don't want you scaring your sisters."

606
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:05.389
That's the way it started.

607
00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:08.559
I was angry and I was afraid.

608
00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.719
And so I lied and I lied so many times.

609
00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.491
I lied to myself.

610
00:36:12.492 --> 00:36:14.969
I've come to terms with the event.

611
00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:17.969
If you look at it. it's very distinct.

612
00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:21.679
And there is a shape to it.

613
00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:25.632
There's physical evidence
that everything I say

614
00:36:25.633 --> 00:36:29.533
is real and happened and no
one can take that away from me.

615
00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:34.799
Marks on the body go back a long time.

616
00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.949
In the middle ages.

617
00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:39.299
if you were found to have
an unusual mark on your body.

618
00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:41.129
that might be considered a witches mark

619
00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:43.539
and you might end up being burned up.

620
00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:47.049
Many contact witnesses
have marks on their bodies.

621
00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:49.609
I have one on my body in fact.

622
00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:52.763
We're in contact with
something that wants them there.

623
00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:54.870
But what are they?

624
00:36:55.931 --> 00:36:57.955
What are they there for?

625
00:36:57.956 --> 00:37:00.799
What are they in our lives?

626
00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:04.749
A mark has a specific meaning to whoever it

627
00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:09.069
and probably a meaning
that is communicated to others

628
00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:12.379
that tells them something about who you are

629
00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:16.029
and who you are working with or belong to.

630
00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:19.749
Even. it could be that these other entities

631
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:22.769
that so many of us regard as
aliens are actually members

632
00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:24.039
of our families.

633
00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:28.219
One of the things that they
mean that's very important

634
00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:33.220
is it's a message that we
are not only here around you.

635
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:37.273
We are in you too.

636
00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:43.200
This is not communication. it's communion.

637
00:37:53.782 --> 00:37:56.615
(mid tempo music)

638
00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:14.329
[John] I was seven years old.

639
00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:17.573
What in God's name do they
want with me in particular?

640
00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:23.599
I think they go to the children first

641
00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:28.600
because the children are
too innocent not to be open

642
00:38:29.309 --> 00:38:31.409
to the possibility

643
00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:36.279
because they have to start
somewhere before the person

644
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.543
is closed to the unknown.

645
00:38:39.954 --> 00:38:42.787
(mid tempo music)

646
00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:47.389
[John] You're probably
not gonna like this section

647
00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:50.919
because it has a lot to do with kids.

648
00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:54.179
And nobody likes when their
children are subjected to things

649
00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:59.113
that parents haven't signed
off on. let alone understand.

650
00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:03.683
When someone interferes
with our children. it scares us.

651
00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:06.289
They're the future.

652
00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:10.373
They're our DNA. they're ours.

653
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.029
Those facts have not stopped this phenomena

654
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:17.599
from interacting with kids.

655
00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:22.089
A lot of people are aware of
the 1994 incident in Zimbabwe

656
00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:22.950
when grade school

657
00:39:22.951 --> 00:39:26.069
through middle school
children saw a craft land

658
00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:28.269
just beyond their playground.

659
00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:30.899
They all rushed out there. saw a being.

660
00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.373
and received telepathic messages.

661
00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:36.377
You may be surprised to discover

662
00:39:36.378 --> 00:39:40.153
that this is not an isolated incident.

663
00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:45.779
1989. Voronezh. Soviet Union.

664
00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:49.443
1978. Glasgow Scotland.

665
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:55.039
1977. Wales UK.

666
00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:58.833
1977. Aberdeen Scotland.

667
00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:04.189
It's the same basic
scenario over and over again.

668
00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:07.539
Young children at recess.
walking to. or from school.

669
00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:12.373
a bright light. a silver
disc. images. a being.

670
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.759
1967 Isle of Wight. UK.

671
00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:22.969
1967. Crestview. Florida.

672
00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:26.493
1966. Melbourne Australia.

673
00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:30.959
1952. Glasgow. Scotland.

674
00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:32.410
a different school this time.

675
00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:36.659
And the conclusive proof
that our ET visitors believe

676
00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:40.049
that real men wear
kilts. the earliest record

677
00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:45.050
of a school sighting was
1948. Greenock. Scotland.

678
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:50.089
The places. names and times of day change.

679
00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:54.339
but the communication is always the same.

680
00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:57.699
The puzzling thing is that
the messages conveyed

681
00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:00.959
or given to children that
would have absolutely no frame

682
00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.473
of reference to receive them.

683
00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:06.363
The earth is precious.

684
00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:08.823
You're hurting your planet.

685
00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:12.069
Cherish your home.

686
00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:13.683
People are precious.

687
00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:16.499
You're hurting each other.

688
00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:18.373
Cherish one another.

689
00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:21.463
We are all one.

690
00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:26.549
As you realize. from
the dates of these events.

691
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:30.129
climate change wasn't really
on the tip of everyone's tongue

692
00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:31.130
at the time.

693
00:41:31.850 --> 00:41:35.149
It's as if ET were seeding
the children to be aware

694
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:37.283
of our universal connectiveness.

695
00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:41.210
We are where we live and what we consume

696
00:41:41.211 --> 00:41:44.619
and they were preparing
them to engage this problem

697
00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:46.133
when they reached adulthood.

698
00:41:49.210 --> 00:41:51.559
Is it still happening?

699
00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:56.039
If it is. it remains very secret.

700
00:41:56.040 --> 00:42:00.649
This planet of ours is
changing now very rapidly

701
00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:03.669
and not in ways that
are going to be conducive

702
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:08.670
to the continued safety of
anything on it. including us.

703
00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:11.391
And it may be that the
experience is changing

704
00:42:11.392 --> 00:42:13.919
with the planet.

705
00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:15.427
And if that's the case.

706
00:42:15.428 --> 00:42:20.428
there might not be any reason
anymore to educate children

707
00:42:20.732 --> 00:42:24.766
in the way they were being
educated back in the '50s

708
00:42:24.767 --> 00:42:27.493
and '60s. and probably the '70s.

709
00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:33.346
After I finally came to terms
with what had happened to me

710
00:42:33.347 --> 00:42:35.453
as a seven year old boy.

711
00:42:36.292 --> 00:42:39.889
I really started to analyze the details.

712
00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:41.969
I didn't wanna miss anything.

713
00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:45.299
There was a part of this
memory that was totally blank

714
00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:46.729
for me and that bothered me.

715
00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:48.919
There was this huge flash of light.

716
00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:51.849
And then I remember coming
back and outta the light.

717
00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:54.599
And I was standing opposite.

718
00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:55.779
I didn't know what happened.

719
00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:59.667
And that piece. that missing
piece. it gnawed at me.

720
00:42:59.668 --> 00:43:03.029
It was this itch in the back of my mind.

721
00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:05.739
like what happened. what happened?

722
00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:08.959
And I had to know.

723
00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:09.960
I just had to know.

724
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.749
And I found in that
group of people. direction.

725
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:20.143
and they directed me to a
woman named Debz Shakti.

726
00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:26.149
She had over 40 years experience
as a quantum hypnotherapist

727
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:28.719
and her practice was globally renowned.

728
00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:30.809
Debz's entire approach was positive

729
00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:32.899
and she considered it her life's purpose

730
00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:35.823
to help others awaken. heal. and grow.

731
00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:40.029
Part of her practice was
being a lifelong yoga meditation

732
00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:42.739
and martial arts and fitness teacher.

733
00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:45.019
as well as a respected open channel

734
00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:48.863
of a highly advanced ET
group known as The Teachers.

735
00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:53.909
Frankly. I didn't know what
to make of that last part.

736
00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:55.519
but who was I to talk?

737
00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:58.479
At seven years old. I had been
visited by a small silver man

738
00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:01.849
that looked like he stepped
out of a sci-fi TV show.

739
00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:05.049
What I can tell you is that
when I first spoke to her.

740
00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:07.859
it was just this something about her.

741
00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:09.976
a genuine kindness that I resonated with

742
00:44:09.977 --> 00:44:11.929
and her calm assurance

743
00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:15.072
that she could help me not
only reclaim my memories.

744
00:44:15.073 --> 00:44:17.689
but that with her guidance.

745
00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:20.493
I could also find peace
with the events of that night.

746
00:44:25.021 --> 00:44:28.188
(wind chimes chiming)

747
00:44:31.875 --> 00:44:34.458
(gentle music)

748
00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:42.129
I'm Debz Shakti.

749
00:44:42.130 --> 00:44:45.279
I've been a professional
Hypnotherapist for many decades.

750
00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:48.379
I specialized a type of hypnotherapy

751
00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:52.849
that I call quantum
hypnotherapy about 40 years ago.

752
00:44:52.850 --> 00:44:55.869
I do channeling because I'm able

753
00:44:55.870 --> 00:45:00.629
to access the universal
stream of consciousness.

754
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:05.630
I have had ET and
inter-dimensional contacts

755
00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:09.393
since I was first able to remember.

756
00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:12.163
I was born in California.

757
00:45:13.330 --> 00:45:15.463
had a really cool little house.

758
00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:21.739
My brother and I were
literally called out into the forest.

759
00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:23.429
We thought there was
a forest fire in the middle

760
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:27.343
of the night and saw a huge craft.

761
00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:34.109
I know that we were put
in that craft and journeyed.

762
00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:37.283
but for me. all I remember were the lights.

763
00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:49.939
The next day going out in secret.

764
00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:52.939
'cause we weren't supposed
to have left the house at night.

765
00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:56.249
going back out in the forest
in the place where we saw it.

766
00:45:56.250 --> 00:45:59.179
there was a burnt circle on the ground

767
00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:00.913
and it was very hot there.

768
00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:09.929
I've been a Yogi most of
my life and a Yoga Teacher.

769
00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:13.349
I have all the Claires.
Claire-sentience and all that.

770
00:46:13.350 --> 00:46:15.309
all the psychic gifts.

771
00:46:15.310 --> 00:46:19.079
which is very helpful in counseling people

772
00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:21.073
from a global perspective.

773
00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:26.980
It used to be people coming
with simple human problems.

774
00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:29.439
How do I lose weight?

775
00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:31.179
How do I stop smoking?

776
00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:33.269
When do I find my true love?

777
00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:35.179
In the last couple of years.

778
00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:38.919
a lot of it has surrounded
the ET or paranormal

779
00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:40.209
if you wanna use that term.

780
00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:43.109
inter-dimensional contact aspect.

781
00:46:43.110 --> 00:46:45.169
People who know they've had an experience.

782
00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:47.079
but they can't put it into the context

783
00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:48.809
of their own understanding.

784
00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:50.469
they want more information

785
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:53.409
or they might even want more

786
00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:55.819
and they don't know how to do that.

787
00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:59.979
It seems to have coalesced
over the last decade or so.

788
00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:04.349
And certainly in the last
few years to who am I?

789
00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:05.853
What am I here for?

790
00:47:05.854 --> 00:47:08.757
Can help me figure this all out.

791
00:47:15.058 --> 00:47:17.558
(eerie music)

792
00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:32.959
So I often wonder why me?

793
00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:35.969
Why am I having these experiences?

794
00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:38.089
Why aren't people believing me?

795
00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:39.439
I'm perfectly sound.

796
00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:43.559
It's just a natural thing that
a lot of people don't accept.

797
00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:45.769
My family's telling me I'm crazy.

798
00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:47.939
I'm wondering maybe I am crazy

799
00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:50.142
'cause if everybody tells you you're crazy.

800
00:47:50.143 --> 00:47:53.219
again. it's you against the world

801
00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:55.999
and it's a frustrating place to be.

802
00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.019
I did not know why they chose me.

803
00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:01.758
I do know once I realized
that this was a real thing

804
00:48:01.759 --> 00:48:03.683
that I wish that they hadn't.

805
00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:21.979
I didn't know it until
many years later.

806
00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:25.169
but other family members
have had experiences.

807
00:48:25.170 --> 00:48:28.149
So I went kind of all my life thinking

808
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:31.269
that it was just a dream and no more.

809
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:33.489
But then when I started
to share it with people.

810
00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:35.649
they started sharing
their experiences with me.

811
00:48:35.650 --> 00:48:37.365
So then I started to realize.

812
00:48:37.366 --> 00:48:39.563
this has to be more than just a dream.

813
00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:44.559
When I started researching.
what wasn't resonating

814
00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:48.469
with me was this abduction. scary torture.

815
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:51.699
It didn't logically make sense to me.

816
00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:53.299
It was more of the message

817
00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:56.449
that the extraterrestrials
were delivering to us.

818
00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:58.513
That started resonating with me.

819
00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:02.379
Why was I chosen?

820
00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:07.349
I made an agreement with
these beings before I incarnated

821
00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:09.529
into this physical form.

822
00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:12.759
The purpose isn't
realized until you get older.

823
00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:14.193
it will start to unfold.

824
00:49:23.097 --> 00:49:26.149
What I'm talking about
here is a series of choices.

825
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:31.150
Early on. I was chosen perhaps
at random to do something

826
00:49:31.988 --> 00:49:34.769
that cracked the cosmic egg.

827
00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:39.099
I went through a long experience
of noticing this presence

828
00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:44.100
in my childhood and I made
another choice to engage with it.

829
00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:49.753
So I think it's a combination
of probably chance.

830
00:49:49.754 --> 00:49:54.754
their interest in an
individual. and choice.

831
00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:58.879
I wondered all my life.
even while I was lying.

832
00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:00.469
I meant. why me?

833
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:02.223
I mean. I'm an average guy.

834
00:50:03.073 --> 00:50:04.309
I was an average kid.

835
00:50:04.310 --> 00:50:05.143
It bothered me.

836
00:50:05.144 --> 00:50:09.673
Was I being blamed for
something or blessed?

837
00:50:10.690 --> 00:50:15.199
When I talked to Debz. I told
her that I desperately wanted

838
00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:20.200
to find out these answers
because the bottom line

839
00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:24.290
is that she promised me peace

840
00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:28.993
and I really needed peace.

841
00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:32.429
I'm confident that you're
going to get the answers

842
00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:33.703
that you came here for.

843
00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:37.989
And that you'll be able to put your life

844
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:41.969
in a different context after
today in a more positive light.

845
00:50:41.970 --> 00:50:46.970
This process. as you know
has you go in as an observer

846
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.559
and when you are able to
see and perceive an experience

847
00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:54.663
from that place. it's a
completely different story.

848
00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:58.179
This tone will activate
your heart a little bit

849
00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:00.419
and I think you'll feel good with it.

850
00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:02.449
So remember. you're just breathing

851
00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:05.279
as you're chanting the mantra.

852
00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:07.929
You breathe at your own pace
and chant at your own pace.

853
00:51:07.930 --> 00:51:10.889
So it'll be a wave between us. all right?

854
00:51:10.890 --> 00:51:11.890
So we'll begin.

855
00:51:16.211 --> 00:51:18.878
(Debz chanting)

856
00:51:28.925 --> 00:51:31.758
(mid tempo music)

857
00:51:46.434 --> 00:51:48.934
(eerie music)

858
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:57.769
The key to falling into the abyss

859
00:51:57.770 --> 00:51:59.635
and when you go into the on known.

860
00:51:59.636 --> 00:52:01.931
you're not attached to the past.

861
00:52:01.932 --> 00:52:04.529
you're not making up the future.

862
00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:05.629
you're going into the unknown

863
00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:07.989
and that's where all the magic happens

864
00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:11.809
because that's where all potential exists.

865
00:52:11.810 --> 00:52:13.310
You have unlimited capability.

866
00:52:15.626 --> 00:52:18.059
And don't ever let anyone
say that hypnosis doesn't work.

867
00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:20.789
It does work in the hands of a real pro.

868
00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:25.790
If you can get past the
barrier of compliance.

869
00:52:26.530 --> 00:52:31.530
you can sometimes evoke
memories that are buried.

870
00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:34.339
Memories are buried by trauma.

871
00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:38.069
How many people have you
heard who were in an auto accident

872
00:52:38.070 --> 00:52:40.896
or a plane crash or
something. and they'll tell you.

873
00:52:40.897 --> 00:52:43.459
"Well. I don't remember a thing."

874
00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:44.769
But they do.

875
00:52:44.770 --> 00:52:49.343
Every instant of that
experience is locked in there.

876
00:52:50.530 --> 00:52:54.409
[John] Quantum hypnosis
is a therapeutic modality

877
00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:56.779
conceived and developed in the early 1980's

878
00:52:56.780 --> 00:53:00.629
by Debz Shakti based on the
quantum physics fundamental

879
00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:04.039
that everything is intimately connected.

880
00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:08.369
occurring simultaneously forever.

881
00:53:08.370 --> 00:53:09.999
An easier way to think of this

882
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.119
is that popularized hypnosis allows one

883
00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:17.059
to access experiences that
they personally have witnessed

884
00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:18.189
in the flesh.

885
00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:21.179
Whereas quantum hypnosis allows one

886
00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:25.710
to access experiences
anywhere from any perspective

887
00:53:25.711 --> 00:53:27.553
in the universe.

888
00:53:28.810 --> 00:53:30.749
People have experiences.

889
00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:33.419
but they're told lies
about those experiences

890
00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:35.699
so they don't talk about 'em.

891
00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:37.393
Debz has helped me a lot.

892
00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:41.563
She's helped me overcome some of my fears.

893
00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:46.739
She's helped me at least to
get started on that right path

894
00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:49.559
of discovering myself.

895
00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:52.209
Finally. I can breathe a sigh relief.

896
00:53:52.210 --> 00:53:56.239
I don't have that pressure
built up inside of me anymore.

897
00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:58.539
No matter how often people protest

898
00:53:58.540 --> 00:54:00.259
that they can't be hypnotized.

899
00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:02.799
I always laugh and say. "We'll see."

900
00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:06.589
I realize maybe that'll take
me back to the fast dreams.

901
00:54:06.590 --> 00:54:09.859
You're viewing consciousness
flashing before your eyes.

902
00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:12.289
You can't slow yourself down.

903
00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:15.089
And that silver cord could be connected

904
00:54:15.090 --> 00:54:18.549
to the silver cord that
connects our souls to our bodies.

905
00:54:18.550 --> 00:54:22.239
And the message was
I have to learn to trust

906
00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:24.459
that where I am right now in this process

907
00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:26.609
is the perfect place for me to be.

908
00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:29.139
And as soon as I start to trust that.

909
00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:30.603
amazing doors will open.

910
00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:36.749
[John] Sigmund Freud coined
the term screen memory

911
00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:37.909
when he examined some

912
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:41.819
of the most vivid visual
memories deriving from childhood

913
00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:43.163
in his patients.

914
00:54:44.648 --> 00:54:48.079
He came to realize that
these distorted recollections

915
00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:50.309
were constructs that the mind would create

916
00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:51.819
to insulate the person

917
00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:55.449
from some childhood psychological trauma.

918
00:54:55.450 --> 00:54:58.529
Ultraman was my screen memory

919
00:54:58.530 --> 00:55:00.009
that shielded me from something

920
00:55:00.010 --> 00:55:03.829
that my terrified seven year old mind

921
00:55:03.830 --> 00:55:07.719
just could not process.

922
00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:10.979
What happened to me as a
boy was not only frightening.

923
00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:15.339
it was so unbelievable
that I lied to myself about it

924
00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:19.653
for almost 45 years so I would
not have to face the event.

925
00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:24.849
the sneering world. or my darkest fears

926
00:55:24.850 --> 00:55:27.173
that it actually did happen.

927
00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:32.509
Are you gonna break
through the screen memory?

928
00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:34.623
Can you bear it after all?

929
00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:38.473
Are you going to decide
instead. wait a minute.

930
00:55:38.474 --> 00:55:40.809
something was going on.

931
00:55:40.810 --> 00:55:42.209
What was it?

932
00:55:42.210 --> 00:55:43.929
I wanna know.

933
00:55:43.930 --> 00:55:46.593
That's when you start to engage in contact.

934
00:55:51.463 --> 00:55:53.963
(eerie music)

935
00:55:57.900 --> 00:56:01.172
When I started this hypnosis.

936
00:56:01.173 --> 00:56:03.283
I have to tell you I was afraid.

937
00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:06.159
I was nervous about what I'd say.

938
00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:09.069
I was nervous about
how it would be handled.

939
00:56:09.070 --> 00:56:11.893
I trusted Debz enough to go under.

940
00:56:13.310 --> 00:56:15.963
Let the body just rest there.

941
00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:22.429
So be open and allow everything to flow.

942
00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:24.529
I wanted to be gentle with him

943
00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:27.839
because he was a
person who had a lot of fear

944
00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:30.639
and was already very vulnerable.

945
00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:35.640
What I'd like for you to
do now is to take yourself

946
00:56:35.790 --> 00:56:39.289
if you like to the place where you were

947
00:56:39.290 --> 00:56:42.849
that seven year old John.

948
00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:44.829
You're in the bathroom.

949
00:56:44.830 --> 00:56:47.479
you're standing in front of the sink.

950
00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:49.663
Can you go there now for me please?

951
00:56:51.249 --> 00:56:52.082
[John] I can hear the water.

952
00:56:52.083 --> 00:56:53.523
I see the light underneath the door.

953
00:56:55.011 --> 00:56:56.163
I turn the water off.

954
00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:59.639
I don't wanna go out yet.

955
00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:02.249
Describe what happens as you go.

956
00:57:02.250 --> 00:57:03.619
The more he described.

957
00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:06.579
the deeper he went and the deeper he went.

958
00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:09.089
the better he was able to journey.

959
00:57:09.090 --> 00:57:10.469
I opened that door.

960
00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:13.089
I had seen Ultraman a thousand times.

961
00:57:13.090 --> 00:57:14.699
I had seen him in my dreams.

962
00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:16.823
I knew for sure that that's what it was.

963
00:57:25.541 --> 00:57:28.457
And there were times
where it got very emotional.

964
00:57:30.923 --> 00:57:34.009
(John sobs)

965
00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:35.169
You're safe. John.

966
00:57:35.170 --> 00:57:37.059
It's okay. it's safe.

967
00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:37.940
There's somebody there.

968
00:57:37.941 --> 00:57:42.869
[Debz] Someone's there.
remember. objective observation.

969
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:43.909
report to me.

970
00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:47.370
[Debz] There's a man there.

971
00:57:48.551 --> 00:57:50.801
And he looks like an ant.

972
00:57:55.415 --> 00:57:59.240
And this dark ant-like
creature. he came at me

973
00:58:00.625 --> 00:58:02.089
and I fought for my life.

974
00:58:02.090 --> 00:58:06.599
But he doesn't have
antenna like a normal ant.

975
00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:11.600
He has like antlers and he
has them on top of his head

976
00:58:12.210 --> 00:58:16.073
and he has them out of
the sides of his cheeks.

977
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.859
And it was fascinating.
but it was so hard

978
00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:22.459
because he was absolutely uncomfortable.

979
00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:24.109
That must look really different

980
00:58:24.110 --> 00:58:26.253
from anything you've ever seen before.

981
00:58:27.310 --> 00:58:29.710
[John] He's trying to
use those antlers on me.

982
00:58:30.550 --> 00:58:31.809
[Debz] How so?

983
00:58:31.810 --> 00:58:36.739
He's pushing things out
of his antlers like energy

984
00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:39.541
or thoughts or something.

985
00:58:39.542 --> 00:58:41.743
Yeah. he is trying to
push me out so I'll go

986
00:58:41.744 --> 00:58:46.744
and I'm not going. no. no.

987
00:58:48.370 --> 00:58:52.946
I recognize him and I thought.

988
00:58:52.947 --> 00:58:54.683
"Oh. I know what you're here for.

989
00:58:55.917 --> 00:58:57.409
"You're gonna take me."

990
00:58:57.410 --> 00:58:58.799
He doesn't care about me.

991
00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:00.349
He doesn't care.

992
00:59:00.350 --> 00:59:01.839
[Debz] He's not an empathic being

993
00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:05.076
like you are. he's different.
[John] He's not. he's not.

994
00:59:05.077 --> 00:59:06.946
He was so brave

995
00:59:06.947 --> 00:59:09.543
because everything
there was terrifying to him.

996
00:59:10.450 --> 00:59:12.629
Oh. this has happened before.

997
00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:17.329
And now I know that I have no choice.

998
00:59:17.330 --> 00:59:19.109
Everything came back to me.

999
00:59:19.110 --> 00:59:22.459
I remembered previous
occasions when he had come for me

1000
00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:24.459
and I had fought him then.

1001
00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:27.209
[Debz] Where does he want you to go. John?

1002
00:59:27.210 --> 00:59:30.649
I'm moving towards him

1003
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:34.759
and I can feel the temperature
change in the hallway.

1004
00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:36.173
There was a flash.

1005
00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:39.219
And then we were gone.

1006
00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:42.749
It felt like heat that
came up from the floor

1007
00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:45.399
And it just kind of
pushed me back like this.

1008
00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:49.489
He just tapped into different
scenes of his experience

1009
00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:52.589
and it disturbed him greatly.

1010
00:59:52.590 --> 00:59:54.743
And the next thing I know.

1011
00:59:56.810 --> 00:59:58.463
I'm in this cavern

1012
01:00:02.967 --> 01:00:06.423
and I knew I'd been here before.

1013
01:00:07.350 --> 01:00:10.719
[Debz] Let's move forward
to where you go then.

1014
01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:11.720
Go there now.

1015
01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:14.410
[John] This place is immense.

1016
01:00:16.636 --> 01:00:17.789
[Debz] Huge.
[John] It's huge.

1017
01:00:17.790 --> 01:00:22.069
I mean. I could scream and it would echo.

1018
01:00:22.070 --> 01:00:23.773
[Debz] You're in a huge place.

1019
01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:26.687
Bring it into focus.

1020
01:00:26.688 --> 01:00:30.023
There's a big opening at the top.

1021
01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:32.759
It looks natural.

1022
01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:35.639
It looks like it's like a cave.

1023
01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:40.640
There are stalactites. things
hanging down from the edges

1024
01:00:41.250 --> 01:00:43.619
of that hole.
All right.

1025
01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:46.139
And there's a very
bright light up there.

1026
01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:47.782
[Debz] Oh.
[John] And it's dark.

1027
01:00:47.783 --> 01:00:49.603
It's very dark in here.

1028
01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:52.117
Safety and peace.

1029
01:00:53.434 --> 01:00:56.169
What do you do here when you're here John?

1030
01:00:56.170 --> 01:00:57.239
I don't know where they come from.

1031
01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:01.830
but there are these
screens. these big screens

1032
01:01:03.163 --> 01:01:08.163
and they show you stuff very fast.

1033
01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:14.569
I tried to move. but they
had some sort of hold on me

1034
01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:18.359
when I would be forced to
see these three huge screens.

1035
01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:21.269
So you see the pictures.

1036
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:25.059
They're the same picture
that make up a big picture.

1037
01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:28.743
And they move from my right to my left.

1038
01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:32.510
Are they speaking with you?

1039
01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:34.884
They don't talk.

1040
01:01:34.885 --> 01:01:39.885
They use those little picture
in your head or something.

1041
01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:42.210
They're different though.

1042
01:01:42.211 --> 01:01:44.559
They're different than the ant guy.

1043
01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:46.179
He's their bully.

1044
01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:47.289
He doesn't care.

1045
01:01:47.290 --> 01:01:49.129
They're indifferent.

1046
01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:51.259
Don't care. don't care.

1047
01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:53.069
They just have a job to do.

1048
01:01:53.070 --> 01:01:53.903
When you were telling me

1049
01:01:53.904 --> 01:01:56.849
that story before you said
there were lots of lights

1050
01:01:56.850 --> 01:01:59.043
like a carousel or a kaleidoscope.

1051
01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:02.229
is this what you were seeing?

1052
01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:05.363
These fast moving pictures. making light?

1053
01:02:06.594 --> 01:02:10.910
It was like I was looking
out of a train moving very fast.

1054
01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:15.859
But the message is in between the lines.

1055
01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:20.047
is in between them. is
inside. is inside. is inside.

1056
01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:24.003
And when we got

1057
01:02:24.004 --> 01:02:29.004
to where it felt like it couldn't
get any more information.

1058
01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:32.969
I asked permission to
talk to his higher-self.

1059
01:02:32.970 --> 01:02:36.609
to that grand wisdom that is
so zoomed out from everything.

1060
01:02:36.610 --> 01:02:39.749
it can see all of the experiences at once

1061
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:43.563
and bring it into kind of a
more coherent explanation.

1062
01:02:45.063 --> 01:02:49.079
But it was almost like
somebody was right behind me

1063
01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:50.680
and I could feel their presence.

1064
01:02:51.579 --> 01:02:52.949
It was like a force.

1065
01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:55.900
And my mouth opened up and
I didn't know what I was saying.

1066
01:02:57.350 --> 01:02:59.873
May I address your
higher-self right now?

1067
01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:02.973
The one who knows everything.

1068
01:03:04.730 --> 01:03:05.563
Yes?

1069
01:03:05.564 --> 01:03:07.113
Thank you so much.

1070
01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:12.609
And the voice that came
out was a whole different John

1071
01:03:12.610 --> 01:03:14.273
that I had ever seen before.

1072
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:18.163
The boy is prepared.

1073
01:03:19.717 --> 01:03:20.717
He must be strong.

1074
01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:22.870
There is a plan.

1075
01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:26.453
It will occur.

1076
01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:29.846
And he will be prepared.

1077
01:03:29.847 --> 01:03:31.569
And he is prepared.

1078
01:03:31.570 --> 01:03:33.359
And I said. "Prepared for what?"

1079
01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:37.737
And they said. "For what's
to come next. the plan."

1080
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:42.819
And then suddenly he
just set up his eyes open

1081
01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:46.973
and he had this laser
beam. eye contact with me.

1082
01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:59.603
You're back.
Yeah.

1083
01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:03.479
He said. "It's completed."

1084
01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:06.269
And then started spewing forth all

1085
01:04:06.270 --> 01:04:09.433
of this incredible wisdom.

1086
01:04:10.957 --> 01:04:15.469
And that is why they
can't take me anymore.

1087
01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:18.739
It's because it's no longer necessary.

1088
01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:22.539
The point was to get me strong enough.

1089
01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:27.540
It's interesting because to me
now. it makes perfect sense.

1090
01:04:27.890 --> 01:04:30.489
Oh my God. I can't tell
you how clear that is to me.

1091
01:04:30.490 --> 01:04:31.789
The pictures didn't matter.

1092
01:04:31.790 --> 01:04:35.529
The message was actually
in the smaller fragments

1093
01:04:35.530 --> 01:04:37.584
and the lines between.

1094
01:04:37.585 --> 01:04:40.719
but the message. the
information was coming through.

1095
01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:41.893
He has a purpose.

1096
01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:47.783
There is a plan and
he needs to get to work.

1097
01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:53.359
There is a war for our souls.

1098
01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:56.349
not in the conventional sense.

1099
01:04:56.350 --> 01:05:01.013
but service to self. service to others.

1100
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.699
He described what it's all about.

1101
01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:09.959
kind of a preparation
speech for what's to come.

1102
01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:12.989
not just for him. but for humanity.

1103
01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:15.689
No one will escape its touch.

1104
01:05:15.690 --> 01:05:18.879
I know and I know it's within my lifetime.

1105
01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:20.603
This is what my purpose is.

1106
01:05:22.938 --> 01:05:26.349
When I went under. everything clarified

1107
01:05:26.350 --> 01:05:28.539
and I experienced something very real.

1108
01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:30.979
I was taken somewhere and I found out

1109
01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:33.330
that I had experienced
it several times before.

1110
01:05:34.421 --> 01:05:39.421
There's something coming
and it's gonna affect every person

1111
01:05:41.424 --> 01:05:43.279
on the planet.

1112
01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:46.319
These encounters that I had as a child

1113
01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:48.859
have been conditioning me.

1114
01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:53.860
I knew that there was a
conflict for the soul of man.

1115
01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:56.480
that we are at a crossroads

1116
01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:02.493
and it would be easy to destroy ourselves.

1117
01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:05.079
It's going to be scary.

1118
01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:06.080
It's gonna be wonderful.

1119
01:06:06.081 --> 01:06:07.369
It's gonna be terrible.

1120
01:06:07.370 --> 01:06:09.599
It's going to be all of these things.

1121
01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:13.653
The message I got was be ready.

1122
01:06:14.830 --> 01:06:18.193
The world is asleep. be ready.

1123
01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:30.670
[Pilot] There's a whole fleet of them.

1124
01:06:30.671 --> 01:06:32.357
look on my ASA. my Gosh!

1125
01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:35.219
[Reporter] Tonight. the
highly anticipated report

1126
01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:37.749
on unexplained aerial phenomena is here.

1127
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:39.429
but the answers are not.

1128
01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:43.919
144 separate sightings of
UFOs by the U.S. military.

1129
01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:47.919
the other 143 remain a
complete and total mystery.

1130
01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:49.809
[Reporter] Over a dozen of those reports

1131
01:06:49.810 --> 01:06:53.599
include observations of
unusual movement patterns.

1132
01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.019
or flight. and they can't explain those.

1133
01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:58.809
So the most sophisticated
military in the world

1134
01:06:58.810 --> 01:07:00.519
has no idea what these things are

1135
01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:02.719
or even how they move from place to place.

1136
01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:05.479
Yeah. ETs are coming here
or however they wanna define it.

1137
01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:07.529
The second question is going to be.

1138
01:07:07.530 --> 01:07:08.769
how the hell did they get here?

1139
01:07:08.770 --> 01:07:13.770
We have in the Pentagon a
whole lot more of those videos.

1140
01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:15.299
And if you think the quality

1141
01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:17.529
of the ones you've seen is good.

1142
01:07:17.530 --> 01:07:18.880
you ain't seen nothing yet.

1143
01:07:21.110 --> 01:07:22.749
[John] The way that the military

1144
01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:25.519
has covered up UFO sightings is legend.

1145
01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:27.129
The government had an official policy

1146
01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:29.319
where they would deny
that what they people saw.

1147
01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:32.919
they would try to create
ridicule around this.

1148
01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:36.109
This is proven through
declassified documents.

1149
01:07:36.110 --> 01:07:37.828
The Air Force has been accused

1150
01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:40.402
of hiding information about UFO's.

1151
01:07:40.403 --> 01:07:42.549
These charges are absolutely untrue.

1152
01:07:42.550 --> 01:07:45.389
[John] Since Roswell.
they're never ending litany

1153
01:07:45.390 --> 01:07:49.039
of weak excuses like weather balloons

1154
01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.519
that move over 600 miles per hour.

1155
01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:55.969
swamp gas that leave circular
burn marks and radioactivity

1156
01:07:55.970 --> 01:07:59.689
on the ground. and atmospheric inversions

1157
01:07:59.690 --> 01:08:02.499
that can evade fighter jets

1158
01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:06.259
have sated skeptics and
frustrated genuine investigators

1159
01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:08.173
for the better part of a century now.

1160
01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:12.089
Even with the latest disclosures
in the "New York Times"

1161
01:08:12.090 --> 01:08:14.689
of sightings of a now famous TIC TAC.

1162
01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:19.429
we find that that information
has been hidden since 2004.

1163
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:23.679
The bottom line is those
guys don't want us to know

1164
01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:24.869
what's going on.

1165
01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:26.729
And they've done everything in their power

1166
01:08:26.730 --> 01:08:30.749
to sidestep. obfuscate.
and outright troll anybody

1167
01:08:30.750 --> 01:08:32.600
that has come forward with the truth.

1168
01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:34.909
And this newly released pile

1169
01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:37.939
of records like the page you see now.

1170
01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:40.809
four words on the entire page were readable

1171
01:08:40.810 --> 01:08:42.384
and not blacked-out.

1172
01:08:42.385 --> 01:08:45.919
And there are hundreds and
hundreds of pages just like that.

1173
01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:47.429
Regular people on the other hand

1174
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:50.629
have from the very
beginning matter-of-factly.

1175
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:52.949
reported these occurrences.

1176
01:08:52.950 --> 01:08:55.479
And in general. they were communicated

1177
01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:57.899
by the media by-and-large.

1178
01:08:57.900 --> 01:09:02.900
fairly throughout the '40s. '50s. and '60s.

1179
01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:05.339
I've been giving you
details on the UFO

1180
01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:06.679
that hung over Redmond. Oregon

1181
01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:09.719
for at least two hours early
this September morning.

1182
01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:12.219
[John] Hell. in response
to the public's interest

1183
01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:14.319
and concern. the House Minority Leader

1184
01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:18.679
at the time. Gerald Ford
demanded a full-blown investigation

1185
01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:22.619
by the house armed
services committee in 1966.

1186
01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:26.169
And in 1969. the sitting
governor of Georgia.

1187
01:09:26.170 --> 01:09:29.389
Jimmy Carter felt comfortable enough

1188
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:32.375
to file a UFO report.

1189
01:09:32.376 --> 01:09:34.993
It all changed later that year in December.

1190
01:09:35.850 --> 01:09:38.869
Armed with the dismissive "Condon Report"

1191
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:43.169
and the inconclusive
end to "Project Blue Book".

1192
01:09:43.170 --> 01:09:45.039
there was a sea change.

1193
01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:47.879
But "Blue Book" is now closed.

1194
01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:50.089
but reports are still being made.

1195
01:09:50.090 --> 01:09:52.139
So under whose command

1196
01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:54.040
and where are they being forwarded to?

1197
01:09:55.272 --> 01:09:57.329
[John] The ones that were
reported only showed up

1198
01:09:57.330 --> 01:10:01.029
on the cover of tabloids or the punchlines

1199
01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:03.869
of late night hosts conversations.

1200
01:10:03.870 --> 01:10:05.719
Did you know there are UFOs out here.

1201
01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:09.096
flying around unidentified?
(audience cheer)

1202
01:10:09.097 --> 01:10:11.150
This would be the place
for 'em. Southern California.

1203
01:10:11.151 --> 01:10:12.786
(audience laugh)

1204
01:10:12.787 --> 01:10:15.049
[John] People wanted to keep
their jobs and their position

1205
01:10:15.050 --> 01:10:19.399
in society without the
uncomfortable snickers

1206
01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:21.039
and jibes behind their backs

1207
01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:24.859
about where their tin foil hats were.

1208
01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:27.453
Here's a question to
those watching this film.

1209
01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:31.829
If the establishment has
spent all this money and effort

1210
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:35.159
to hide and discredit UFO sightings.

1211
01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:38.096
which are pretty innocuous in themselves.

1212
01:10:38.097 --> 01:10:43.097
to what ends with the powers
that be go to hide something

1213
01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:48.220
as mind blowing as alien
interaction with their citizens?

1214
01:10:49.630 --> 01:10:53.099
The good news is that there
are more people asking questions

1215
01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:55.539
and demanding answers
now about this subject

1216
01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:56.733
than ever before.

1217
01:10:58.350 --> 01:11:01.209
From the believers who
think the aliens are here

1218
01:11:01.210 --> 01:11:03.839
to the hardcore skeptics who
spend whole time debunking

1219
01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:05.249
that stuff. they think it's good

1220
01:11:05.250 --> 01:11:07.169
that we're finally
having this conversation.

1221
01:11:07.170 --> 01:11:08.889
They're saying we need
to get on-board on this.

1222
01:11:08.890 --> 01:11:10.779
It's finally time to figure it out.

1223
01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:12.849
That's a major shift in attitude.

1224
01:11:12.850 --> 01:11:15.729
There's a lot of pressure
by the global public

1225
01:11:15.730 --> 01:11:18.529
and the American public for answers.

1226
01:11:18.530 --> 01:11:22.333
Let's take this subject
out of the shadows

1227
01:11:22.334 --> 01:11:25.053
and put it where it
belongs in the spotlight.

1228
01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:36.179
Well. at this point in John's
progression through the work

1229
01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:37.359
that we were doing.

1230
01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:41.229
I realized that he was on a continual quest

1231
01:11:41.230 --> 01:11:43.639
for understanding and
meaning of the experiences

1232
01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:46.219
that he had gone through
and still undergoes.

1233
01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:49.489
And I realized it was time that
maybe he should meet someone

1234
01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:52.589
who had similar experiences in his life

1235
01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:54.739
and who had been documenting them.

1236
01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:57.819
And more than anybody on
the planet understands this

1237
01:11:57.820 --> 01:11:59.559
in the same way.

1238
01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:01.863
And that person is Whitley Strieber.

1239
01:12:05.546 --> 01:12:08.046
(eerie music)

1240
01:12:15.210 --> 01:12:17.384
Whitley has written more

1241
01:12:17.385 --> 01:12:19.379
on this subject than anybody else.

1242
01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:24.380
And he has a way of sharing
first person. his reactions.

1243
01:12:28.129 --> 01:12:33.129
and also just being
completely. raw. truthful

1244
01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:36.119
with the facts.

1245
01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:41.120
He truly is the harbinger of
this information to the world.

1246
01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:01.030
I've never thought of
myself as being on a mission.

1247
01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:09.289
I'm very interested in
understanding the world around us

1248
01:13:09.290 --> 01:13:12.989
and I'm very interested
in the welfare of mankind.

1249
01:13:12.990 --> 01:13:15.809
And I think this is a great big universe.

1250
01:13:15.810 --> 01:13:19.199
And I just sense that
what's here is very unique

1251
01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:21.653
and very beautiful and extraordinary.

1252
01:13:22.730 --> 01:13:26.499
What is the destiny of the human soul?

1253
01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:30.319
The visitors have taught
me that living out of love.

1254
01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:33.479
compassion and humility are essential

1255
01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:35.363
to building a strong soul.

1256
01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:41.290
And my question is always.
what does love really mean?

1257
01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:44.739
Where is that feeling in myself

1258
01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:48.853
and how do I see it in others
and in the world around me?

1259
01:13:49.970 --> 01:13:54.599
Compassion. how do I not forget to find it

1260
01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:56.843
when someone makes me angry?

1261
01:13:58.130 --> 01:14:03.130
Humility. without humility
we're not fully human.

1262
01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:08.489
We have to be humble. but in the end.

1263
01:14:08.490 --> 01:14:12.139
every single one of us is exactly the same.

1264
01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:17.079
We are all equal. profoundly equal.

1265
01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:22.080
My love of mankind and
of this planet is my mission.

1266
01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:29.550
There is a peace beyond
this life that we will find

1267
01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:32.739
and we will taste.

1268
01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:33.670
And these people

1269
01:14:33.671 --> 01:14:37.699
who are on this mission
are all on the mission

1270
01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:38.723
for the same reason.

1271
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.999
If I could go back and
tell my 12 year old self

1272
01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.339
what I know now. I would
tell her it's gonna be okay.

1273
01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:52.829
that I'm not going crazy.

1274
01:14:52.830 --> 01:14:55.709
that these experiences are real.

1275
01:14:55.710 --> 01:14:57.229
You're not alone.

1276
01:14:57.230 --> 01:14:58.333
We're not alone.

1277
01:14:59.450 --> 01:15:02.059
I floated up toward him.

1278
01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:03.709
He was no longer the popcorn man.

1279
01:15:03.710 --> 01:15:07.599
He was just light and I was
just light and we merged.

1280
01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:10.019
I got a download. we are one.

1281
01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:12.189
It was the most intense
love I can describe.

1282
01:15:12.190 --> 01:15:14.809
I never felt love like that before.

1283
01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:17.649
The answer is that we
need to grow spiritually.

1284
01:15:17.650 --> 01:15:19.539
We need to realize that we really are one

1285
01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:21.839
because what we do to the planet.

1286
01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:23.149
what we do to someone else

1287
01:15:23.150 --> 01:15:25.150
is actually we're doing it to ourselves.

1288
01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:28.633
This is the start of
an awakening for me.

1289
01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.509
These are genuine experiences

1290
01:15:32.510 --> 01:15:34.799
and they're nothing to be afraid of.

1291
01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:37.299
It's opened up new relationships for me.

1292
01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:40.659
It's made me closer to people that I love.

1293
01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:43.613
They're here primarily to help us.

1294
01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:47.859
All my experiences
led me to the belief

1295
01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:52.659
that I was protected and that
these were loving experiences.

1296
01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:55.769
I volunteered to come here for a mission.

1297
01:15:55.770 --> 01:15:59.196
And that was to use
my knowledge and ability

1298
01:15:59.197 --> 01:16:03.803
to try to raise awareness
and help heal the world.

1299
01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:09.019
I'm starting to pay
attention to life. to nature.

1300
01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:11.049
There was this one night I walked out

1301
01:16:11.050 --> 01:16:13.519
to a huge explosion of light.

1302
01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:17.519
It was almost like a dance
and I was just blown away.

1303
01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:20.659
It's changed me to such a great degree

1304
01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:22.689
in terms of my level of compassion.

1305
01:16:22.690 --> 01:16:26.073
compassion towards
humans. towards our planet.

1306
01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:53.549
My relationship has
changed to this phenomena.

1307
01:16:53.550 --> 01:16:54.799
We're all one energy.

1308
01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:55.730
We're one source.

1309
01:16:55.731 --> 01:16:57.249
We're all aspects of God.

1310
01:16:57.250 --> 01:16:59.939
And that includes the
plant kingdom. the animals.

1311
01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:02.729
the humans. our star being friends.

1312
01:17:02.730 --> 01:17:04.959
It's all from the same spark of light.

1313
01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:08.719
When we all realize that
we have the capability

1314
01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:12.509
of working intuitively and
expanding our consciousness.

1315
01:17:12.510 --> 01:17:14.379
that's gonna change the world

1316
01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:16.779
and we can live a very prosperous.

1317
01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:19.609
loving heart-centered experience.

1318
01:17:19.610 --> 01:17:22.373
It makes me cry. it's really beautiful.

1319
01:17:24.820 --> 01:17:27.869
My biggest hope. my
biggest wish. my biggest prayer

1320
01:17:27.870 --> 01:17:31.609
is that the world come into coherence.

1321
01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:36.479
that we end the separate.
dualistic nature of our species.

1322
01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:39.449
Everyone is connected to everyone.

1323
01:17:39.450 --> 01:17:42.919
When we can see things from
that global zoomed out view

1324
01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:45.009
that our star friends see us.

1325
01:17:45.010 --> 01:17:47.129
there's no denying what we have to do.

1326
01:17:47.130 --> 01:17:49.349
We have to become peaceful. harmonious.

1327
01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:51.389
We need to learn to work together.

1328
01:17:51.390 --> 01:17:53.543
We're all connected on some level.

1329
01:17:55.690 --> 01:17:59.429
When people watch
television or they see shiny lights

1330
01:17:59.430 --> 01:18:02.950
in the sky. that's one
thing and it's fascinating

1331
01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:05.660
and you can discuss it over coffee.

1332
01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:10.830
but if you're met face-to-face
with something so alien

1333
01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:17.390
as an intelligence from
another planet or dimension.

1334
01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:20.863
that will change you.

1335
01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:24.430
It changed me.

1336
01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:28.599
I can look at those things
through the eyes of a man

1337
01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:30.463
and realize they're not to be feared.

1338
01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:34.793
but they must be dealt with.

1339
01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:39.499
We are all on a journey.

1340
01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:44.500
The edge of time is an
ecstatic union with the unknown.

1341
01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:47.309
It's the increase of ecstasy

1342
01:18:47.310 --> 01:18:49.999
that is the aim of consciousness.

1343
01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.649
We've come to the end of an age.

1344
01:18:52.650 --> 01:18:55.339
Something is happening on planet earth.

1345
01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:56.439
Look around you.

1346
01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:59.469
Everything is changing
and it's not changing in ways

1347
01:18:59.470 --> 01:19:02.399
that are going to be positive
for the human species.

1348
01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:04.439
It's gonna be getting
harder to live on earth

1349
01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:07.129
because earth is is tired and old.

1350
01:19:07.130 --> 01:19:12.130
There is a peace beyond this life

1351
01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:15.179
that we will find and we will taste.

1352
01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:20.180
The visitors are here as
midwives to the birth of man.

1353
01:19:22.115 --> 01:19:24.373
That is the answer.

1354
01:19:27.031 --> 01:19:29.614
(gentle music)

1355
01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:36.750
Well. John. I think you are
ready to go through a new door.

1356
01:19:40.330 --> 01:19:45.017
I'm gonna open that door
and you are going out.

1357
01:19:47.936 --> 01:19:49.539
I'm at peace with the information.

1358
01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:54.540
but I am still struggling with
integrating that information.

1359
01:19:54.580 --> 01:19:57.549
That bright. shiny lights in
this sky can make you think

1360
01:19:57.550 --> 01:20:00.069
about who you are as a person.

1361
01:20:00.070 --> 01:20:01.369
How does that make sense?

1362
01:20:01.370 --> 01:20:03.129
These are the things that I'm seeking.

1363
01:20:03.130 --> 01:20:06.109
These are the things
that I need to understand.

1364
01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:10.399
I need some more help and
now I need to take the next steps.

1365
01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:13.529
So I'm hoping I'll be
guided to the next person

1366
01:20:13.530 --> 01:20:16.890
who can gimme some
direction and help me finally

1367
01:20:17.790 --> 01:20:20.825
at long last move forward.

1368
01:20:20.826 --> 01:20:23.659
