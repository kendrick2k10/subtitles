6
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.410
I've been dreaming
about this day forever.

7
00:01:21.445 --> 00:01:22.807
like every girl. I guess.

8
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.678
Viktor wasn't so
enthusiastic. though.

9
00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:28.549
Those Catholic ceremonies
are so beautiful.

10
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.157
Look. I wanted
to show you the church

11
00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:33.191
where we're getting married.

12
00:01:34.722 --> 00:01:36.392
- Here.
-  Mm.

13
00:01:37.527 --> 00:01:40.429
Oh. Zhenya it's so beautiful.

14
00:01:40.695 --> 00:01:43.498
I bet you wore
the most beautiful dress
at your own wedding.

15
00:01:44.633 --> 00:01:45.863
I didn't have a wedding.

16
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.404
Sonya.
can you please stay still?

17
00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:49.702
I need to fix this piece.

18
00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:52.243
Oh. oh. oh Vit. no.

19
00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:54.377
What are you doing?
You know it's bad luck.

20
00:01:54.412 --> 00:01:56.214
You know I don't
believe in that stuff.

21
00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:57.809
How much longer will you be?
Hi.

22
00:01:57.943 --> 00:02:00.350
Let me introduce you.
Vitya. Zhenya.

23
00:02:00.385 --> 00:02:01.780
- Hello.
-

24
00:02:05.951 --> 00:02:07.753
Continue. I'll get her.

25
00:02:08.624 --> 00:02:12.131
He's practicing.
-

26
00:02:28.677 --> 00:02:33.284
-

27
00:02:55.704 --> 00:02:59.442
-  Shh. shh.

28
00:03:07.881 --> 00:03:10.915
-

29
00:03:56.831 --> 00:03:58.699
- Okay. enough.
-

30
00:04:01.033 --> 00:04:02.604
I told you not to come here.

31
00:04:02.936 --> 00:04:06.344
-

32
00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:20.424
-

33
00:04:38.972 --> 00:04:42.446
Zhenya. what happened?

34
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.785
Come on. don't be silly.

35
00:04:52.359 --> 00:04:53.655
You can't change what happened.

36
00:04:55.054 --> 00:04:56.922
Believe me. he'll love you
more than before.

37
00:04:57.793 --> 00:04:59.056
It could happen to anyone.

38
00:04:59.696 --> 00:05:01.399
You should just tell him
you didn't see anything.

39
00:05:02.127 --> 00:05:03.335
Mm.

40
00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:06.668
The guy just lost it.

41
00:05:31.057 --> 00:05:33.728
Okay. enough. enough.

42
00:05:34.863 --> 00:05:36.368
Stop torturing yourself.

43
00:05:36.997 --> 00:05:38.568
You can't force him to stay.

44
00:05:42.739 --> 00:05:44.376
Forget about him. Evgenia.

45
00:05:44.741 --> 00:05:45.773
Get him out of your head.

46
00:06:02.462 --> 00:06:04.561
I don't want Polina to grow up
without a father.

47
00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:07.663
Everyone makes mistakes.

48
00:06:08.798 --> 00:06:09.929
Anyone can mess up.

49
00:06:14.804 --> 00:06:15.803
Here.

50
00:06:18.038 --> 00:06:19.807
You can't force someone
to love you.

51
00:06:21.074 --> 00:06:22.975
Unless you cast
a love spell. of course.

52
00:06:34.153 --> 00:06:36.824
Hello Elena. is Kir home?

53
00:06:38.828 --> 00:06:39.827
What's happened?

54
00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:42.093
I've just come by
to drop off his stuff.

55
00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:44.964
He promised to stop by
and pick it up.

56
00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:47.098
but he's been ignoring my calls
for three days.

57
00:06:47.133 --> 00:06:48.132
That's odd.

58
00:06:49.335 --> 00:06:52.136
I thought you always knew
where Kirill was and who with.

59
00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:55.447
Just there please.

60
00:06:55.482 --> 00:06:56.745
I'll see he gets it.

61
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.718
What are you doing?

62
00:07:03.754 --> 00:07:05.017
I thought you'd come
get your things.

63
00:07:05.492 --> 00:07:06.491
Didn't have time

64
00:07:08.154 --> 00:07:09.153
We need to talk.

65
00:07:24.544 --> 00:07:26.676
You can see other girls

66
00:07:28.812 --> 00:07:31.142
if that's what you need for
your life and your creativity.

67
00:07:33.982 --> 00:07:35.487
We can handle it. right?

68
00:07:35.687 --> 00:07:37.082
Yeah. well. there's no us.

69
00:07:37.953 --> 00:07:39.590
You're suffocating me.
all right?

70
00:07:41.693 --> 00:07:42.890
Of course there's an us.

71
00:07:43.959 --> 00:07:45.596
There's you. there's me.
and Polina.

72
00:07:47.127 --> 00:07:48.126
And what?

73
00:07:49.195 --> 00:07:51.635
You think you own me
because I got you pregnant?

74
00:07:53.001 --> 00:07:55.474
-

75
00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:56.640
Get off. idiot.

76
00:08:03.011 --> 00:08:04.010
Get outta here.

77
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.630
-

78
00:09:22.794 --> 00:09:24.255
Oh. come in. dear.

79
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:26.026
I was starting to think
you got lost.

80
00:09:26.864 --> 00:09:28.699
Help me out. Go on.

81
00:09:30.835 --> 00:09:31.834
Don't be scared.

82
00:09:37.974 --> 00:09:39.072
Be honest.

83
00:09:39.107 --> 00:09:40.238
Don't play games with me.

84
00:09:40.746 --> 00:09:42.108
Are you ready to go all the way

85
00:09:42.682 --> 00:09:44.616
or is it just a matter of pride?

86
00:09:47.984 --> 00:09:48.983
You love him?

87
00:09:49.249 --> 00:09:50.853
You wanna be with him forever?

88
00:09:52.252 --> 00:09:53.724
- Mm-hm.
- Mm.

89
00:09:53.759 --> 00:09:55.022
That's what really matters.

90
00:09:57.796 --> 00:10:00.632
Do you have a friend
getting married soon?

91
00:10:02.427 --> 00:10:04.295
Yeah. but most of them
are actually already married.

92
00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:05.395
You have to find one.

93
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.133
One whose love is very strong.

94
00:10:07.432 --> 00:10:09.201
Spirits feed on true feelings.

95
00:10:11.678 --> 00:10:13.777
Trust me.
you don't want to trick them.

96
00:10:16.177 --> 00:10:18.078
Throw the salt
in four directions.

97
00:10:19.048 --> 00:10:20.344
You have to learn it by heart.

98
00:10:20.819 --> 00:10:23.215
Don't change the order.
don't stumble.

99
00:10:25.758 --> 00:10:27.054
You have to do it in a church.

100
00:10:27.089 --> 00:10:28.759
It's easier
to reach the spirits there.

101
00:10:31.357 --> 00:10:32.664
Do it during their wedding.

102
00:10:32.699 --> 00:10:33.896
How much do I owe you?

103
00:10:33.931 --> 00:10:35.931
How much are you ready to pay
for you love?

104
00:10:39.266 --> 00:10:40.265
Just remember.

105
00:10:44.073 --> 00:10:46.304
if you lied to me
and your love is fake.

106
00:10:46.339 --> 00:10:47.778
the spirits won't forgive you.

107
00:10:49.881 --> 00:10:51.375
If he loves you.
he'll come back.

108
00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.917
If he doesn't.
don't expect anything good.

109
00:10:56.316 --> 00:10:58.184
-

110
00:10:59.154 --> 00:11:00.923
Blood will make the spell
stronger.

111
00:11:01.321 --> 00:11:02.991
Cast it
until the meat's spoiled.

112
00:11:08.801 --> 00:11:09.861
You'll be bound by blood.

113
00:11:13.938 --> 00:11:15.432
Unless you change your mind.

114
00:11:18.844 --> 00:11:22.340
a mockingbird

115
00:11:22.947 --> 00:11:26.850
baby dear

116
00:11:27.116 --> 00:11:30.986
will be near

117
00:11:43.198 --> 00:11:45.803
-

118
00:12:05.484 --> 00:12:08.023
- Hi.
- Oleg. you shouldn't be here.

119
00:13:25.234 --> 00:13:27.938
Dearly beloved.
we are gathered here today

120
00:13:27.973 --> 00:13:32.272
to witness the union of Viktor
and Sophia in holy matrimony.

121
00:13:34.639 --> 00:13:36.045
Marriage is sacred.

122
00:13:37.213 --> 00:13:39.147
No one should
enter into it hastily.

123
00:13:39.644 --> 00:13:43.250
One must enter into a marriage
with devotion and discretion.

124
00:13:46.519 --> 00:13:49.927
Dear Lord.
our most merciful Father.

125
00:13:50.655 --> 00:13:53.227
You embody the truth.
love. and life.

126
00:13:53.262 --> 00:13:55.427
Your kindness
fills the universe.

127
00:13:56.628 --> 00:13:59.167
I place my soul
into this first candle.

128
00:13:59.499 --> 00:14:01.466
Make us. Kirill and Evgenia.

129
00:14:01.501 --> 00:14:03.567
intertwined like
these two candles.

130
00:14:06.275 --> 00:14:09.177
Beloved son. Viktor. and Sophia.

131
00:14:09.916 --> 00:14:12.576
is your wish today
to be joined in holy matrimony

132
00:14:12.611 --> 00:14:15.348
before this congregation
genuine and willful?

133
00:14:16.285 --> 00:14:17.084
- Yes.
- Yes.

134
00:14:17.451 --> 00:14:19.319
Kirill's soul
is placed in the second.

135
00:14:20.091 --> 00:14:21.926
Make him stay with me forever.

136
00:14:22.456 --> 00:14:25.622
Make him loyal and devoted
only to you.

137
00:14:26.229 --> 00:14:27.360
Make him honest.

138
00:14:29.463 --> 00:14:32.002
Make him loyal and devoted
only to me

139
00:14:32.532 --> 00:14:34.565
and by lighting these candles.

140
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.270
I ignite Kirill's heart
and soul.

141
00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.239
Make him think of me.

142
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:40.340
Make him love me.

143
00:14:40.375 --> 00:14:42.507
Do you promise
to be true to each other

144
00:14:42.542 --> 00:14:44.146
for better or for worse?

145
00:14:44.577 --> 00:14:45.576
Yes.

146
00:14:47.052 --> 00:14:48.546
The first candle yours.

147
00:14:49.318 --> 00:14:50.581
The second candle mine.

148
00:14:59.394 --> 00:15:01.427
You are mine and I am yours.

149
00:15:02.529 --> 00:15:04.265
You are mine and I am yours.

150
00:15:06.566 --> 00:15:08.500
You are mine and I am yours.

151
00:15:11.175 --> 00:15:13.175
Both in sickness and in health?

152
00:15:13.738 --> 00:15:14.946
Yes.

153
00:15:18.347 --> 00:15:20.116
You are mine and I am yours.

154
00:15:35.265 --> 00:15:38.035
Here and now. I confirm
and bless your marriage.

155
00:15:38.763 --> 00:15:42.402
but what God has joined.
let no man separate.

156
00:15:44.274 --> 00:15:45.504
In the name of the Father.

157
00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:47.539
and the Son.

158
00:15:50.676 --> 00:15:52.148
and the Holy Spirit.

159
00:16:46.666 --> 00:16:49.238
-

160
00:17:02.418 --> 00:17:03.417
What?

161
00:17:08.226 --> 00:17:09.225
It's okay.

162
00:17:10.426 --> 00:17:11.557
It's just nerves.

163
00:17:58.309 --> 00:17:59.308
Zhenya!

164
00:18:12.653 --> 00:18:15.621
-

165
00:18:21.563 --> 00:18:23.101
This is very bad luck

166
00:18:26.535 --> 00:18:27.666
and you know that.

167
00:19:19.786 --> 00:19:21.192
Zhenya. can you hear me?

168
00:19:23.295 --> 00:19:24.690
You're gonna breathe
by yourself now.

169
00:19:27.728 --> 00:19:28.727
There we go.

170
00:19:29.697 --> 00:19:31.598
- Careful. that's good.

171
00:19:38.541 --> 00:19:40.244
You had an acute infection.

172
00:19:40.774 --> 00:19:41.872
Everything's fine now.

173
00:19:42.908 --> 00:19:44.380
Would you like to call someone?

174
00:19:45.383 --> 00:19:48.252
Your family? Your daughter.
where is she now?

175
00:19:48.518 --> 00:19:49.517
She's with my mom.

176
00:19:50.355 --> 00:19:51.486
Don't call anyone.

177
00:19:53.391 --> 00:19:54.555
I just need to go home.

178
00:19:54.821 --> 00:19:57.360
Tomorrow.
You need some rest until then.

179
00:19:58.297 --> 00:20:00.924
Viktor. I'm so. so sorry.

180
00:20:00.959 --> 00:20:03.300
Please forgive me.
I ruined your wedding.

181
00:20:04.798 --> 00:20:05.797
Rest.

182
00:20:38.766 --> 00:20:42.273
Vitya. Vit. I'm sorry.
please. please wait.

183
00:20:42.308 --> 00:20:43.538
I don't know how it happened.

184
00:20:43.573 --> 00:20:44.704
I'm begging you. Viktor.

185
00:20:44.739 --> 00:20:46.310
Please. forgive me.

186
00:20:46.345 --> 00:20:48.510
Please don't go! Vitya!

187
00:21:36.021 --> 00:21:38.054
-

188
00:21:53.038 --> 00:21:54.906
-

189
00:22:01.453 --> 00:22:02.551
What are you doing here?

190
00:22:05.116 --> 00:22:06.456
You were in my dream.

191
00:22:07.987 --> 00:22:09.987
Calling me.
It was strange. I...

192
00:22:11.056 --> 00:22:13.089
spent the rest of the day
thinking about you.

193
00:22:15.599 --> 00:22:16.498
You were right.

194
00:22:17.436 --> 00:22:19.469
We should be together.
We'll get through this.

195
00:22:24.608 --> 00:22:25.607
Forgive me?

196
00:22:31.142 --> 00:22:32.350
I do.

197
00:24:42.647 --> 00:24:43.745
You scared me.

198
00:24:54.791 --> 00:24:55.922
You're so beautiful.

199
00:24:59.191 --> 00:25:00.498
Like a bride.

200
00:25:03.668 --> 00:25:04.667
The light on you.

201
00:25:06.836 --> 00:25:07.835
Stand there.

202
00:25:56.952 --> 00:25:58.050
Hi. Mom.

203
00:25:59.383 --> 00:26:01.053
Don't worry.
we'll be there soon.

204
00:26:04.289 --> 00:26:05.827
Something happened
during the storm.

205
00:26:07.028 --> 00:26:08.324
Let's go get Polina?

206
00:26:59.685 --> 00:27:00.783
I guess it was the wind.

207
00:27:01.919 --> 00:27:03.918
We should have gotten rid of all
of this a long time ago.

208
00:27:06.153 --> 00:27:09.924
I'll board it up now and
put in a new one later.

209
00:27:12.225 --> 00:27:14.324
Mom. maybe you can
stay with us for a while?

210
00:27:14.359 --> 00:27:15.963
I wouldn't wanna bother.
sweetheart.

211
00:27:15.998 --> 00:27:17.096
You've got your own family.

212
00:27:17.263 --> 00:27:18.966
But you're also
a part of the family.

213
00:27:19.265 --> 00:27:21.001
- right. Kirill?
-

214
00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:24.169
Well.
maybe for a few days.

215
00:27:30.848 --> 00:27:31.946
Uh. could you tell me. Kirill--

216
00:27:31.981 --> 00:27:33.376
You'd be bothering us.

217
00:27:37.052 --> 00:27:38.051
What?

218
00:27:39.021 --> 00:27:40.922
I said. you'd be bothering us.

219
00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:46.389
Mom. taxi's already here.

220
00:27:47.326 --> 00:27:48.325
Go get ready.

221
00:27:50.164 --> 00:27:51.295
What about the garden. dear?

222
00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:52.802
Who'll take care of my garden?

223
00:27:53.497 --> 00:27:55.200
No. honey. I'm staying.

224
00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.774
Maybe you and Polina
can stay here

225
00:27:57.809 --> 00:27:59.809
just as a change of scenery
to relax.

226
00:28:00.075 --> 00:28:01.844
But there are
some things to do at home.

227
00:28:02.913 --> 00:28:04.748
We'd love to
spend some time together.

228
00:28:07.082 --> 00:28:08.147
Okay.

229
00:28:57.198 --> 00:28:58.527
Hey. what are you doing?

230
00:28:58.562 --> 00:29:00.133
I've got work today.

231
00:29:00.168 --> 00:29:01.332
I don't understand.

232
00:29:02.038 --> 00:29:04.401
It's all much more perfect
in real life.

233
00:29:07.373 --> 00:29:08.372
Wait.

234
00:29:11.443 --> 00:29:13.784
Kirill. I need to get going.

235
00:29:18.956 --> 00:29:20.351
You don't have to work anymore.

236
00:29:24.192 --> 00:29:25.796
It distracts you.

237
00:29:29.868 --> 00:29:31.901
Nobody should distract us.

238
00:29:35.071 --> 00:29:36.532
We'll be together always.

239
00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:39.172
Do you understand?

240
00:29:40.373 --> 00:29:41.537
Just you and me.

241
00:29:48.414 --> 00:29:51.789
Shh. easy. babe. you can't move.

242
00:30:28.289 --> 00:30:29.519
She's asleep.

243
00:30:56.383 --> 00:30:59.186
I'm yours and you're mine.

244
00:31:00.959 --> 00:31:02.486
Just like you wanted.

245
00:31:44.101 --> 00:31:45.397
Why won't you cut me
some slack?

246
00:31:45.432 --> 00:31:46.398
I've only worn it once.

247
00:31:47.973 --> 00:31:49.940
You know.
every bride wears her dress once

248
00:31:49.975 --> 00:31:51.007
if she's lucky.

249
00:31:52.538 --> 00:31:55.341
Maybe you can refund me half
or rent it somehow?

250
00:31:55.376 --> 00:31:57.145
Sonya. what's the matter?

251
00:31:58.346 --> 00:32:00.115
Nothing's wrong.
Take your dress.

252
00:32:01.052 --> 00:32:02.348
Wait. is there a problem?

253
00:32:02.581 --> 00:32:04.515
- Maybe I can help you.
- You already did.

254
00:32:04.748 --> 00:32:06.451
He broke up with me
on my wedding day.

255
00:32:07.993 --> 00:32:08.992
Sonya.

256
00:32:09.995 --> 00:32:11.093
Why the hell
did you show up at our wedding?

257
00:32:15.528 --> 00:32:16.967
Kate. let's process this dress

258
00:32:17.002 --> 00:32:18.397
as a canceled order. please.

259
00:32:38.683 --> 00:32:39.682
Hello.

260
00:32:40.851 --> 00:32:43.686
Um. I came to see you last week
about the love spell.

261
00:32:47.131 --> 00:32:47.797
He's yours now.

262
00:32:47.832 --> 00:32:49.263
- What?

263
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:54.532
-

264
00:34:05.341 --> 00:34:07.341
-

265
00:34:13.877 --> 00:34:15.085
What's wrong?

266
00:34:15.615 --> 00:34:16.614
Nothing.

267
00:34:17.749 --> 00:34:19.518
Listen.
I've asked about the dress.

268
00:34:19.553 --> 00:34:23.126
We'll have to return the money
to his credit card

269
00:34:23.755 --> 00:34:25.623
because he used it
to pay for the dress.

270
00:34:25.856 --> 00:34:27.361
So. are we doing the refund?

271
00:34:27.396 --> 00:34:28.395
Yeah. yeah.

272
00:34:38.539 --> 00:34:40.836
Kir. I'm home.

273
00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.299
Polina?

274
00:35:37.697 --> 00:35:39.169
Polina. sweetie.

275
00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:42.799
There. there. it's okay.

276
00:35:43.736 --> 00:35:44.834
Shh.

277
00:35:46.739 --> 00:35:47.837
Quiet. quiet.

278
00:35:49.841 --> 00:35:51.445
Kirill.
are you out of your mind?

279
00:35:51.843 --> 00:35:53.183
Was she here all alone?

280
00:35:53.977 --> 00:35:55.416
Baby. come on.

281
00:35:58.718 --> 00:36:00.256
Nothing happened.

282
00:36:00.291 --> 00:36:01.389
I was busy.

283
00:36:01.424 --> 00:36:02.819
You said you'd be back soon.

284
00:36:03.558 --> 00:36:05.690
I thought something changed
when you came back.

285
00:36:06.792 --> 00:36:08.396
I thought you really loved us.

286
00:36:08.596 --> 00:36:13.533
Babe. I love you. but
you're always somewhere else.

287
00:36:13.568 --> 00:36:15.370
You're always going somewhere.

288
00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:17.603
either to work
or somewhere else.

289
00:36:17.902 --> 00:36:20.870
We need to eliminate
everything that's unnecessary.

290
00:36:21.378 --> 00:36:23.906
See. I don't wanna share you
with anyone.

291
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:27.646
Please. don't leave me
like that again.

292
00:36:29.584 --> 00:36:30.383
Stay with me.

293
00:36:31.883 --> 00:36:34.785
I'm yours.
but I'm not your property.

294
00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:35.951
I can't live like this.

295
00:36:37.262 --> 00:36:39.262
You're my wife.
You must.

296
00:36:39.825 --> 00:36:40.824
I'm not your wife.

297
00:36:43.565 --> 00:36:44.597
-

298
00:36:47.833 --> 00:36:51.406
Please. sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

299
00:36:51.441 --> 00:36:52.539
I--I just...

300
00:36:53.872 --> 00:36:56.312
There. there. forgive me.

301
00:36:57.348 --> 00:36:58.347
Shh.

302
00:37:03.288 --> 00:37:05.585
-

303
00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:17.960
- Hello?
-  Hey.
your mom stopped by.

304
00:37:17.995 --> 00:37:19.368
She took Polina.

305
00:37:20.671 --> 00:37:22.470
I was thinking maybe
we could have lunch together?

306
00:37:22.505 --> 00:37:23.933
I can't.
I have a lot of work to do.

307
00:37:25.035 --> 00:37:26.507
Okay. then. sorry.

308
00:37:32.548 --> 00:37:33.547
Good afternoon.

309
00:37:34.716 --> 00:37:36.451
- Hello.
-  So. what's going on
with my card?

310
00:37:36.783 --> 00:37:38.849
We are able to refund
the money to your card.

311
00:37:39.555 --> 00:37:41.720
Mm.
You can keep the dress.

312
00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:44.954
But your bride asked us--

313
00:37:44.989 --> 00:37:46.329
She's not my bride.

314
00:37:47.332 --> 00:37:48.463
I'll leave the money for her.

315
00:37:49.994 --> 00:37:51.631
- Can you give it to her?
-  Okay.

316
00:37:52.601 --> 00:37:53.765
This will be the refund.

317
00:37:54.339 --> 00:37:55.338
As you wish.

318
00:37:57.837 --> 00:37:58.869
Hello.

319
00:38:00.543 --> 00:38:01.575
How are you feeling?

320
00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:03.280
I'm fine. thank you.

321
00:38:04.074 --> 00:38:05.282
Can we talk?

322
00:38:08.584 --> 00:38:11.046
I thought you two
were so in love with each other.

323
00:38:12.456 --> 00:38:13.884
Sorry. I guess
it's none of my business.

324
00:38:14.557 --> 00:38:16.590
I thought so. too.
but I was wrong.

325
00:38:19.595 --> 00:38:21.056
Everyone makes mistakes.

326
00:38:21.091 --> 00:38:23.630
Yes and they should be
responsible for their mistakes.

327
00:38:30.507 --> 00:38:34.641
You know. I feel very guilty
for what I did to you.

328
00:38:36.876 --> 00:38:37.875
Um...

329
00:38:38.647 --> 00:38:40.009
- I was at the church and--
- Look.

330
00:38:40.979 --> 00:38:42.517
it doesn't really matter
anymore.

331
00:38:43.652 --> 00:38:44.651
Did you also make this?

332
00:38:46.556 --> 00:38:47.555
Yes.

333
00:38:48.591 --> 00:38:49.788
It's beautiful.

334
00:38:53.090 --> 00:38:55.464
I suppose you really love
what you do.

335
00:39:06.037 --> 00:39:07.905
-

336
00:39:15.717 --> 00:39:17.420
Zhenya. what's wrong?

337
00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:18.619
Where does it hurt?

338
00:39:36.034 --> 00:39:38.771
-

339
00:39:39.103 --> 00:39:40.002
Kirill. stop.

340
00:39:40.038 --> 00:39:41.807
- Who the hell are you?
-  Enough.

341
00:39:42.711 --> 00:39:43.941
I said stop!

342
00:39:52.017 --> 00:39:54.589
Stop. Kirill. calm down.

343
00:39:54.822 --> 00:39:55.654
He's a doctor.

344
00:39:56.021 --> 00:39:58.153
I felt sick and
he was taking me home.

345
00:40:01.532 --> 00:40:02.564
Are you done?

346
00:40:04.997 --> 00:40:05.996
Yes.

347
00:40:44.135 --> 00:40:46.773
I'm sorry.
I don't know what came over me.

348
00:40:47.875 --> 00:40:51.877
I saw you two together
and I just lost it.

349
00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:57.014
I need to go to my mom's
to pick up Polina.

350
00:40:58.083 --> 00:40:59.489
Let me take you there.

351
00:41:17.036 --> 00:41:18.508
Where are we going. Kirill?

352
00:41:18.939 --> 00:41:19.938
Can you hear me?

353
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:35.855
Why are you bringing me here?

354
00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:38.594
And so I took you to my mom's.

355
00:41:38.827 --> 00:41:40.695
Are you kidding?
She hates me.

356
00:42:06.822 --> 00:42:07.621
Well...

357
00:42:10.023 --> 00:42:12.155
our relationship's been
tense lately.

358
00:42:17.294 --> 00:42:20.801
It's my fault. but we...

359
00:42:23.641 --> 00:42:24.673
we're working on it.

360
00:42:26.677 --> 00:42:28.303
We're learning from
our mistakes.

361
00:42:30.945 --> 00:42:35.079
but there's one mistake that
I'd like to correct right now.

362
00:42:35.246 --> 00:42:36.245
What's going on?

363
00:42:42.088 --> 00:42:43.087
Zhenya.

364
00:42:45.861 --> 00:42:48.565
I know you were expecting me
to do this sooner.

365
00:42:54.001 --> 00:42:55.836
but you're going to be my wife.

366
00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:57.332
Kirill.

367
00:43:00.678 --> 00:43:03.943
I...I need to think about it.

368
00:43:03.978 --> 00:43:05.846
She needs to think.

369
00:43:07.245 --> 00:43:09.377
She can do whatever she wants.

370
00:43:15.319 --> 00:43:17.319
Of course.

371
00:43:18.993 --> 00:43:20.960
I'm so stupid.
Mom. give me the ring.

372
00:43:20.995 --> 00:43:22.390
Kirill. enough with this farce.

373
00:43:22.425 --> 00:43:24.293
Nobody here
is interested in your opinion.

374
00:43:24.669 --> 00:43:26.669
Mom. give me the damn ring
right now!

375
00:43:27.199 --> 00:43:32.334
This damn ring. as you call it.
is an heirloom.

376
00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:35.645
This ring will be given
to someone who's worthy

377
00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:36.778
with my blessing.

378
00:44:39.073 --> 00:44:40.809
Run. Zhenya. run.

379
00:44:48.511 --> 00:44:50.115
Where are you going so fast?

380
00:44:51.085 --> 00:44:52.117
To see your daughter?

381
00:44:53.824 --> 00:44:54.823
She's fine.

382
00:44:59.423 --> 00:45:00.763
She's with my mom.

383
00:45:11.402 --> 00:45:12.434
Where is she?

384
00:45:17.012 --> 00:45:18.143
What did you do to her?

385
00:45:28.221 --> 00:45:29.825
It's just that you're mine

386
00:45:31.961 --> 00:45:32.960
and I'm yours.

387
00:45:33.996 --> 00:45:35.732
Remember?
Just like you wanted.

388
00:45:38.066 --> 00:45:40.231
No. this is not what I wanted.

389
00:45:41.168 --> 00:45:45.940
All I wanted was for you to
love me. but I made a mistake.

390
00:45:46.844 --> 00:45:48.206
What mistake. baby?

391
00:45:49.209 --> 00:45:50.241
I really do love you.

392
00:45:52.982 --> 00:45:54.509
No you don't. Kirill.

393
00:45:56.953 --> 00:45:57.985
I cast a spell.

394
00:45:58.548 --> 00:45:59.756
Hear me?

395
00:46:02.090 --> 00:46:04.926
I made you love me.
but I promise I'll fix this.

396
00:46:04.961 --> 00:46:07.126
Please.
just let us go now. Kirill.

397
00:46:14.905 --> 00:46:17.301
Shh. come here. silly thing.

398
00:46:20.141 --> 00:46:22.273
How could you
make someone love you?

399
00:46:26.048 --> 00:46:27.377
It's simple.

400
00:46:27.412 --> 00:46:29.016
I'm yours and you're mine.

401
00:46:31.152 --> 00:46:32.151
understand?

402
00:46:34.155 --> 00:46:39.092
-

403
00:46:59.213 --> 00:47:02.412
-

404
00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:27.041
-

405
00:47:52.530 --> 00:47:55.366
Baby. you're awake.

406
00:47:57.139 --> 00:47:58.974
but you can't get up just yet.

407
00:48:01.407 --> 00:48:02.406
Where are you?

408
00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:04.639
Yoo-hoo.

409
00:48:06.577 --> 00:48:09.050
We'll be together forever.

410
00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:12.119
Where are you?

411
00:48:13.386 --> 00:48:14.385
Baby.

412
00:48:17.258 --> 00:48:18.653
-

413
00:48:58.497 --> 00:49:00.365
The hell's the matter with you?

414
00:49:08.474 --> 00:49:10.078
- You break up with your man?
- Yes.

415
00:49:12.082 --> 00:49:13.180
I did.

416
00:49:15.448 --> 00:49:16.447
Men are bastards.

417
00:50:10.668 --> 00:50:12.140
What the hell are you doing?

418
00:50:47.144 --> 00:50:52.147
-

419
00:53:18.361 --> 00:53:19.426
Morning. Zhenya.

420
00:53:20.529 --> 00:53:21.956
I bought some diapers and
formula for your daughter.

421
00:53:23.828 --> 00:53:26.301
I hope I chose the right ones.

422
00:53:26.336 --> 00:53:27.929
Viktor. I feel so awkward.

423
00:53:28.965 --> 00:53:31.240
We showed up at your place
in the middle of the night.

424
00:53:31.275 --> 00:53:33.308
- You probably thought--
- No. Zhenya. I didn't.

425
00:53:35.444 --> 00:53:36.608
I'm glad you showed up.

426
00:53:39.712 --> 00:53:42.911
Here's the deal. you have
breakfast and get some rest.

427
00:53:43.485 --> 00:53:44.616
I'm saying this as a doctor.

428
00:53:45.719 --> 00:53:47.322
Then I'll come back and
we'll figure something out.

429
00:53:48.358 --> 00:53:49.819
- Deal?
- Deal.

430
00:53:50.921 --> 00:53:51.920
Great.

431
00:54:01.305 --> 00:54:02.403
Hello.

432
00:54:06.871 --> 00:54:08.772
Vit. I know
you'll never believe me.

433
00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:12.248
but can you please.
please hear me out?

434
00:54:18.388 --> 00:54:19.486
Vit.

435
00:54:19.521 --> 00:54:21.389
The lift's at capacity. Vik.

436
00:54:22.986 --> 00:54:24.557
Sorry. Sonya. no room.

437
00:54:27.056 --> 00:54:28.693
Vit. I won't leave
until we talk.

438
00:54:28.728 --> 00:54:29.727
Do you hear me?

439
00:54:31.467 --> 00:54:32.829
- Thanks. Kol.
- Hm.

440
00:54:33.766 --> 00:54:35.337
My ex is the same.

441
00:54:36.032 --> 00:54:37.999
Running around like a hyena.

442
00:54:41.741 --> 00:54:42.740
Who you have here?

443
00:54:44.106 --> 00:54:46.876
Motorcyclist with
a nasty head wound.

444
00:54:48.011 --> 00:54:51.452
Gotta do some
facial reconstruction
to not scare his family.

445
00:54:51.487 --> 00:54:53.916
-

446
00:55:13.509 --> 00:55:14.937
-

447
00:56:23.073 --> 00:56:25.447
-

448
00:56:54.643 --> 00:56:56.478
-

449
00:57:08.888 --> 00:57:12.791
-

450
00:57:15.257 --> 00:57:16.531
Zhenya. what's the matter?

451
00:57:28.677 --> 00:57:29.676
Kir was here.

452
00:57:30.679 --> 00:57:31.843
I don't know how he found us.

453
00:57:35.684 --> 00:57:37.079
Zhenya. Kirill's dead.

454
00:57:37.719 --> 00:57:39.719
-

455
00:57:50.765 --> 00:57:52.732
You ready?
- Yes.

456
00:58:26.064 --> 00:58:28.229
Can you please give us
one moment alone?

457
00:58:30.101 --> 00:58:31.100
Mm-hm.

458
00:58:43.312 --> 00:58:45.246
-

459
00:59:13.848 --> 00:59:14.847
Please forgive me.

460
00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:19.654
It's all my fault.

461
00:59:22.318 --> 00:59:24.054
I just couldn't let you go.

462
00:59:28.192 --> 00:59:29.895
-

463
00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:37.936
-

464
00:59:48.850 --> 00:59:50.586
-

465
01:00:30.826 --> 01:00:33.123
Listen. sometimes
when you're stressed out.

466
01:00:33.158 --> 01:00:34.795
your perception
can get distorted.

467
01:00:34.830 --> 01:00:36.632
It gets hard to see what's real
and what's not.

468
01:00:39.461 --> 01:00:40.900
I need to go now.

469
01:00:41.298 --> 01:00:42.737
Zhenya. but where?

470
01:00:42.772 --> 01:00:43.771
-

471
01:00:45.038 --> 01:00:46.037
It hurt?

472
01:00:47.172 --> 01:00:48.776
Okay. you need to stay here.

473
01:00:53.046 --> 01:00:54.045
Hey.

474
01:00:56.181 --> 01:00:57.917
I see you're here a lot. Zhenya.

475
01:00:58.183 --> 01:00:59.655
Some cute doctors. huh?

476
01:01:02.726 --> 01:01:04.187
And you don't look like
you're grieving much.

477
01:01:04.893 --> 01:01:07.058
Sonya. please. go home.

478
01:01:07.258 --> 01:01:08.422
Maybe better that she go?

479
01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:11.095
She's right. I have to go.

480
01:01:12.065 --> 01:01:13.064
Thanks for the help.

481
01:01:17.906 --> 01:01:18.971
Please forgive me.

482
01:01:22.372 --> 01:01:24.339
Just don't expect him
to marry you now.

483
01:01:24.814 --> 01:01:27.144
Marriage is something that
sticks with you. right. Vit?

484
01:01:28.884 --> 01:01:30.719
Her husband died today.

485
01:01:38.355 --> 01:01:40.828
Mom. how is Polina?

486
01:01:42.293 --> 01:01:43.457
Can I pick her up tomorrow?

487
01:01:43.998 --> 01:01:45.129
Yeah.

488
01:01:46.198 --> 01:01:47.934
Thanks. love you. too.

489
01:02:13.093 --> 01:02:15.159
I know this is going to
sound stupid.

490
01:02:17.328 --> 01:02:18.767
but I cast a spell.

491
01:02:20.199 --> 01:02:21.935
I wanted to bring Kirill back.

492
01:02:32.211 --> 01:02:34.376
You and Sonya seemed like
the perfect couple.

493
01:02:36.413 --> 01:02:38.248
Everything was
supposed to work out.

494
01:02:42.892 --> 01:02:45.024
But our feelings weren't true.
that's why it went wrong.

495
01:02:47.259 --> 01:02:48.764
It turned out to be a nightmare.

496
01:02:54.233 --> 01:02:57.234
Listen.
everything will be just fine.

497
01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.979
I summoned
a very strong demon.

498
01:03:06.542 --> 01:03:09.213
He feeds on pure love.
but he was tricked.

499
01:03:09.611 --> 01:03:11.919
You rewarded him
with rotten meat.

500
01:03:21.194 --> 01:03:23.062
You see?
Your love wasn't true.

501
01:03:25.231 --> 01:03:26.362
I want to fix this.

502
01:03:27.266 --> 01:03:28.397
There must be a way. right?

503
01:03:29.235 --> 01:03:31.466
Some mistakes
can only be fixed in death.

504
01:03:33.536 --> 01:03:35.404
Zhenya. she's messing around
with you.

505
01:03:36.539 --> 01:03:38.110
Coming was a mistake.

506
01:03:40.510 --> 01:03:45.018
I don't know how to fix this.
myself. but. you can ask.

507
01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:47.515
However. it's dangerous.

508
01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:50.452
What do I have to do?

509
01:03:51.290 --> 01:03:53.257
Not you. him.

510
01:03:54.524 --> 01:03:56.260
If he's here.
he'll bring the demon.

511
01:03:57.197 --> 01:03:58.834
Okay. enough.

512
01:04:00.662 --> 01:04:02.266
Everything she said is true.

513
01:04:05.304 --> 01:04:07.073
Are you always
like this. doctor?

514
01:04:07.603 --> 01:04:10.175
Doing only what's right
and not how you feel?

515
01:04:11.475 --> 01:04:13.178
Why did you marry that girl?

516
01:04:13.213 --> 01:04:14.443
You didn't want that. did you?

517
01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:17.050
Could it be
that you made a mistake?

518
01:04:18.317 --> 01:04:20.053
My mistake was coming here.

519
01:04:21.287 --> 01:04:22.583
Then why are you here?

520
01:04:23.553 --> 01:04:24.552
Think.

521
01:04:37.501 --> 01:04:38.973
Enter when the time comes.

522
01:04:51.383 --> 01:04:53.416
-

523
01:05:03.329 --> 01:05:04.559
Close your eyes.

524
01:05:06.629 --> 01:05:08.299
No sudden movements.

525
01:05:21.182 --> 01:05:23.314
-

526
01:06:41.196 --> 01:06:44.032
-

527
01:06:45.266 --> 01:06:47.002
Master are you here?

528
01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:50.665
I'm here. come.

529
01:06:59.445 --> 01:07:01.346
Why are you hunting this woman?

530
01:07:03.416 --> 01:07:04.646
She summoned me.

531
01:07:09.653 --> 01:07:11.158
What do you need from her?

532
01:07:12.788 --> 01:07:13.787
Her soul.

533
01:07:15.791 --> 01:07:17.329
She promised it to me.

534
01:07:20.466 --> 01:07:22.334
The first candle my soul.

535
01:07:26.109 --> 01:07:27.240
The second...

536
01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:29.209
hers.

537
01:07:30.839 --> 01:07:33.345
I take all I have been promised.

538
01:09:14.283 --> 01:09:15.678
You all belong to him now.

539
01:09:16.945 --> 01:09:18.879
It's only a matter of time.

540
01:09:20.685 --> 01:09:21.618
Do you understand what you did?

541
01:09:23.424 --> 01:09:26.260
You came to someone's wedding.
you ruined it.

542
01:09:29.826 --> 01:09:31.595
You killed a man. Zhenya.

543
01:09:33.764 --> 01:09:35.467
Kirill died because of you.

544
01:09:39.506 --> 01:09:43.673
I want to fix everything. but.
I need you. your help.

545
01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:47.809
I don't wanna be
involved in this.

546
01:09:49.648 --> 01:09:50.779
I'm sorry.

547
01:11:01.588 --> 01:11:02.884
Oleg. why are you here?

548
01:11:02.919 --> 01:11:03.918
Go away.

549
01:11:10.058 --> 01:11:11.959
Sonya. you don't love him.

550
01:11:12.863 --> 01:11:13.862
I can tell.

551
01:11:26.107 --> 01:11:27.843
- We need to talk.
- Oleg. please don't.

552
01:11:28.010 --> 01:11:29.581
- I love Sonya.
- Oleg. enough.

553
01:11:29.616 --> 01:11:30.615
This is nonsense.

554
01:11:30.782 --> 01:11:31.880
We'll discuss later.

555
01:11:33.455 --> 01:11:34.454
Give us a minute.

556
01:11:34.918 --> 01:11:35.917
Please.

557
01:11:44.994 --> 01:11:47.863
-

558
01:11:53.002 --> 01:11:54.936
You can't reverse the spell.

559
01:11:54.971 --> 01:11:57.004
Your marriage is blessed
by the Devil.

560
01:11:57.578 --> 01:11:59.611
Every participant
is now marked.

561
01:12:00.812 --> 01:12:02.515
My daughter is reckless.

562
01:12:02.781 --> 01:12:04.077
She has made many mistakes

563
01:12:04.112 --> 01:12:06.046
and owes the spirits
a great debt.

564
01:12:06.081 --> 01:12:08.686
She thought she could
pay them off with pure love.

565
01:12:09.788 --> 01:12:10.919
but she failed.

566
01:12:14.397 --> 01:12:17.431
Making pacts with the Devil
is a dangerous thing.

567
01:12:18.599 --> 01:12:20.896
but even he can be tricked.

568
01:12:22.130 --> 01:12:24.438
You know. I thought
that if we got married

569
01:12:25.738 --> 01:12:26.869
it would have been
the right thing.

570
01:12:28.005 --> 01:12:31.478
To settle down. have a family.
like it's usually done.

571
01:12:34.813 --> 01:12:36.945
but to be honest.
I never really loved you.

572
01:12:42.623 --> 01:12:44.018
You never loved me either.

573
01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:47.890
I mean really loved.

574
01:12:55.537 --> 01:12:56.602
I guess...

575
01:12:58.133 --> 01:13:00.375
we were caught
in this untrue love.

576
01:13:00.674 --> 01:13:01.904
Nothing could have helped us.

577
01:13:03.039 --> 01:13:04.071
Not the wedding.

578
01:13:07.549 --> 01:13:08.548
not a spell.

579
01:13:11.817 --> 01:13:13.454
If love wasn't true.

580
01:13:15.216 --> 01:13:16.853
then the deal can be called off.

581
01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:21.429
You'll have to gather everyone
who was at the wedding

582
01:13:21.893 --> 01:13:24.762
and perform the ceremony
in reverse order.

583
01:13:26.128 --> 01:13:29.129
but they all have to come
of their own free will.

584
01:13:30.572 --> 01:13:33.606
Otherwise. the demon won't
stop until he gets your soul.

585
01:13:42.650 --> 01:13:43.748
I won't help her.

586
01:13:43.783 --> 01:13:44.947
She ruined everything.

587
01:13:47.886 --> 01:13:49.556
In some way we're also guilty.

588
01:13:50.218 --> 01:13:53.989
I think it's the time
to fix it all. everything.

589
01:13:55.256 --> 01:13:56.695
You know what. you fix it.

590
01:13:59.931 --> 01:14:00.963
You do it.

591
01:14:04.903 --> 01:14:06.034
Thank you. Oleg.

592
01:14:11.712 --> 01:14:13.173
-

593
01:14:13.208 --> 01:14:14.944
- Sonya.
-

594
01:15:48.204 --> 01:15:49.808
-

595
01:16:22.271 --> 01:16:24.238
-

596
01:16:37.726 --> 01:16:38.725
You okay?

597
01:16:39.694 --> 01:16:42.993
There. everyone
who's involved has arrived.

598
01:17:12.288 --> 01:17:14.794
Has everyone come here
by their own free will?

599
01:17:15.192 --> 01:17:17.159
The ceremony
will be performed only

600
01:17:17.194 --> 01:17:19.392
with the consent
of every participant.

601
01:17:22.001 --> 01:17:24.100
The spirits don't like
to be tricked.

602
01:17:25.136 --> 01:17:27.400
The liar shall pay
for their mistake.

603
01:17:34.717 --> 01:17:36.783
-

604
01:17:56.233 --> 01:17:59.773
We are our own.
blood and blood.

605
01:17:59.808 --> 01:18:02.435
-

606
01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:06.340
The second candle.
release my soul.

607
01:18:06.375 --> 01:18:08.045
-

608
01:18:21.962 --> 01:18:25.964
The first candle.
release my soul.

609
01:18:27.132 --> 01:18:29.099
Wait. stop.

610
01:18:29.464 --> 01:18:31.871
-

611
01:19:10.208 --> 01:19:13.242
Polina. Polina. my sweet baby.

612
01:19:24.354 --> 01:19:25.485
Where is the girl?

613
01:19:52.019 --> 01:19:53.447
-

614
01:19:54.450 --> 01:19:56.956
-

615
01:21:01.924 --> 01:21:05.860
Polina.
Polina. where are you?

616
01:21:07.061 --> 01:21:11.030
Zhenya. what do we do?

617
01:21:11.461 --> 01:21:13.527
- Mom?
- Your daughter's missing.

618
01:21:27.543 --> 01:21:29.279
Come on. come on.
pick up the phone.

619
01:21:31.547 --> 01:21:32.546
She's not answering.

620
01:21:58.376 --> 01:21:59.375
They're not here.

621
01:22:03.183 --> 01:22:04.314
I know where they are.

622
01:22:42.453 --> 01:22:43.683
-

623
01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:07.212
Hold on.

624
01:23:22.526 --> 01:23:24.229
Mom. Mama.

625
01:23:28.532 --> 01:23:31.533
Mom. Mom. we're going to
get you out of here.

626
01:23:36.837 --> 01:23:38.441
I'll help her.
Go look for your daughter.

627
01:24:01.202 --> 01:24:02.465
Hold on.
It's going to hurt.

628
01:24:18.879 --> 01:24:22.089
-

629
01:24:48.876 --> 01:24:50.084
Mom?

630
01:26:20.902 --> 01:26:21.901
Stop it!

631
01:26:31.385 --> 01:26:32.384
I'll be with you.

632
01:26:35.389 --> 01:26:37.389
You are mine and I am yours.

633
01:26:38.425 --> 01:26:39.424
Take my soul.

634
01:27:16.023 --> 01:27:17.891
Everything's going to be okay.

635
01:27:55.766 --> 01:27:58.602
-

636
01:28:16.787 --> 01:28:19.722
