00:06:59.177 --> 00:07:02.042
I met Whitney Houston!

176
00:07:02.145 --> 00:07:03.215
- She loved Monica and Brandy.

177
00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:05.252
That was--to Whitney.
that was the--

178
00:07:05.355 --> 00:07:07.599
the future of music. you know?

179
00:07:07.703 --> 00:07:11.810
She actually said that. um...

Grammy weekend.

181
00:07:13.363 --> 00:07:18.886
in--in LA. the last--
the last Clive party.

182
00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:20.992
when they were
on stage. rehearsing.

183
00:07:21.095 --> 00:07:23.304
And we were standing down.
and she was standing there.

184
00:07:23.408 --> 00:07:26.722
And she said. that's
the future. she said.

185
00:07:26.825 --> 00:07:31.796
- What connected me to her
was really the way she loved.

186
00:07:31.899 --> 00:07:34.868
She would love others more
than she loved herself.

187
00:07:34.971 --> 00:07:37.318
When I think about Whitney.

188
00:07:37.422 --> 00:07:40.805
the first thing that
I picture is her smile.

189
00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:47.328
It was something that. believe
it or not. she never lost.

190
00:07:47.432 --> 00:07:50.987
When I think of her. I think
about the selflessness.

191
00:07:51.091 --> 00:07:52.506
That was her.

192
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:53.680
She used to always tell me.

193
00:07:53.783 --> 00:07:55.682
don't let them
change who you are.

194
00:07:55.784 --> 00:07:58.236
She used to always point at
her chest when she talked.

195
00:07:58.339 --> 00:08:00.307
or she would touch my
face when she talked.

196

Whitney could have
been anywhere.

202
00:08:15.943 --> 00:08:18.463
But she would show up.

203
00:08:18.567 --> 00:08:20.948
When I was 18. I
lost my grandmother.

204
00:08:21.052 --> 00:08:23.399
I lost--I witnessed
a suicide.

205

206

Whitney didn't
call on the phone.

207
00:08:28.128 --> 00:08:31.752
Three black trucks pulled up
in the hood and she jumped out.

208
00:08:31.856 --> 00:08:35.342
And I can hear her saying.
I know y'all know where she is!

209

210

outside. suited and booted.

giving them the hand.

this is serious.

214

Go away. I got it.

215
00:08:50.599 --> 00:08:55.189
And her and Bobby. they
stayed right there with me.

216
00:08:56.121 --> 00:08:59.815

lost my second eldest brother.

217
00:08:59.918 --> 00:09:02.542
And. uh. we're in the
middle of the service.

218

And everybody--everybody goes to
whis--you know. to whispering.

219
00:09:06.925 --> 00:09:07.995
They're whispering.

220
00:09:08.099 --> 00:09:09.169
And I'm like. what
are they whispering?

221
00:09:09.272 --> 00:09:10.929
And it's Whitney.

222
00:09:11.033 --> 00:09:14.208
She has somehow made it
to Detroit. Michigan.

223
00:09:14.312 --> 00:09:18.799
made it to the funeral. and
she's walking in by herself.

- You know. it's interesting.

697
00:29:13.096 --> 00:29:14.373
'cause life really
changed for Whitney

698
00:29:14.476 --> 00:29:16.340
after she gave birth
to Bobbi Kristina.

699
00:29:16.444 --> 00:29:17.894
- CECE: She loved being a mom.

700
00:29:17.997 --> 00:29:19.999
It was a beautiful thing to see.

701
00:29:20.103 --> 00:29:23.037
how much she cared
and loved her.

702
00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:24.279
- WHITNEY: It's a
different thing. you know?

703
00:29:24.383 --> 00:29:26.005
Um. when you become a mother.

704
00:29:26.109 --> 00:29:28.767
It changes your whole
perspective on life. you know?

705
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:31.148
You really don't
live for you anymore.

706
00:29:31.252 --> 00:29:32.840
You're living for your children.

707
00:29:32.943 --> 00:29:36.395
- That was something that
she really wanted. a family.

708
00:29:36.498 --> 00:29:39.570
And she wanted a strong
family. you know?

709
00:29:39.674 --> 00:29:44.368
And so she was determined
not to allow the business

710
00:29:44.472 --> 00:29:46.060
to stop that from happening.

711

713
00:29:48.925 --> 00:29:52.135

deserve to be. um.

Uh. this press thing
and all that madness.

716
00:29:56.795 --> 00:29:59.418
She doesn't deserve to
be followed. you know?

717
00:29:59.521 --> 00:30:02.214
Or be taken pictures
of her all the time.

718
00:30:02.317 --> 00:30:04.561
And I'm very. very
protective of her.

719
00:30:04.664 --> 00:30:06.149
And I will fight you.

720
00:30:06.252 --> 00:30:09.290
And I will tear your house
down brick by brick about her.

726
00:30:21.336 --> 00:30:24.753
Um. unfortunately she
ended up losing the baby.

727
00:30:24.857 --> 00:30:26.997
- That wasn't the first
miscarriage she had.

728
00:30:27.101 --> 00:30:30.173

She lost a baby around
the time of "The Bodyguard."

733
00:30:42.357 --> 00:30:44.394
- There was a lot
going on around her.

734
00:30:44.497 --> 00:30:46.534
but not enough privacy for her

735
00:30:46.637 --> 00:30:49.606

you've got everybody in-involved

00:30:58.511 --> 00:31:00.755
in your marriage and
your relationship?

740
00:31:00.859 --> 00:31:03.482
- Whitney and Bobby together.

741
00:31:03.585 --> 00:31:05.656
it was one of the most
polarizing relationships

742
00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.693
that we saw play
out in front of us.

743
00:31:07.796 --> 00:31:10.109
I mean. they did face
a lot of criticism.

744
00:31:10.213 --> 00:31:11.559
But Whitney stayed by him.

745
00:31:11.662 --> 00:31:13.664
She stayed by him
through so much.

746
00:31:13.768 --> 00:31:15.252
And I think the two of them

747
00:31:15.356 --> 00:31:19.325
developed this us against
the world type of attitude.

748
00:31:19.429 --> 00:31:21.086
- Stay strong. baby.
I got your back.

very last performance

839
00:34:51.261 --> 00:34:54.437
was on stage with Kelly
Price in a small nightclub.

840
00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:56.163
And it was completely unplanned.

841
00:34:56.266 --> 00:34:59.269
- I feel like that's kind
of a gift that God gave me.

842

didn't know. he knew.

a very intimate and
special moment with her.

845
00:35:07.967 --> 00:35:12.213

my limit and didn't care.

I love you so much for that.

She made her way to the stage.

856
00:35:33.752 --> 00:35:34.960
And she was like.
give me the microphone.

857
00:35:35.063 --> 00:35:36.513
I would've never asked
her to take the stage.

858
00:35:36.617 --> 00:35:38.791
I would've never stuck
the microphone in her face.

859
00:35:38.895 --> 00:35:41.277
Everyone that was there
was performing that night.

860
00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:43.348
And. uh. she started--

861
00:35:43.451 --> 00:35:44.694
She took the microphone.

862

with her voice.

But for me. it's
like 10 minutes.

888
00:36:56.904 --> 00:36:59.286
It's like 10 days.

889
00:36:59.389 --> 00:37:02.530
I can remember prepping
for the pre-Grammy show

890
00:37:02.634 --> 00:37:05.809
and feeling like I'm
gonna make her proud.

891

She was in and out
of the rehearsals.

892
00:37:07.915 --> 00:37:12.747
She kept touching my face and
just telling me...you got it.

00:37:12.851 --> 00:37:13.817
Don't worry about it.

894

used to always tell me.

She would always
tell me. like...

898
00:37:21.929 --> 00:37:23.862
you forget who you are.

899
00:37:23.965 --> 00:37:27.314

I always made.

901
00:37:28.729 --> 00:37:32.284

other 30 hours before.

902
00:37:32.388 --> 00:37:36.599
And when I think about it. I
think the moment I found out.

903
00:37:36.702 --> 00:37:38.532
um. and how unbelievable it was.

904
00:37:38.635 --> 00:37:41.742
I was praying it was
a cruel internet hoax.

905

907
00:37:45.711 --> 00:37:49.543
the only person I trusted
to even tell me what to do

908
00:37:49.646 --> 00:37:53.063
or where to go was Miss Dionne.

909
00:37:53.167 --> 00:37:56.791
And so when she
said. you stay here.

910
00:37:56.895 --> 00:38:00.519
you're the only person I want
to keep Krissy. stay here.

911
00:38:00.623 --> 00:38:02.625
that's what I did.

912
00:38:02.728 --> 00:38:04.937
- Gary had told me that Whitney
had wanted to talk to me.

913
00:38:05.041 --> 00:38:06.870
This was a few days prior.

914
00:38:06.974 --> 00:38:10.978
She asked me. Pat.
why do people judge me?

915
00:38:11.081 --> 00:38:12.186
That was the first time

916
00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:14.671
she'd really spoken
about being judged.

917
00:38:14.775 --> 00:38:16.432
And I was struggling.

918
00:38:16.535 --> 00:38:19.055
I was praying. like.
God. give me the words.

919
00:38:19.158 --> 00:38:21.782
And I said.
only God can judge you

920
00:38:21.885 --> 00:38:25.372
at his appointed time.

921
00:38:25.475 --> 00:38:28.858
I'm just gonna stay out here
with her until we go back.

922
00:38:28.961 --> 00:38:30.308
We can go back together.

923
00:38:30.411 --> 00:38:33.828
And I didn't realize
that on that Monday.

924
00:38:33.932 --> 00:38:37.004
I was taking her home.

925
00:38:37.107 --> 00:38:42.389
But it was me and Gary
taking her home to Jersey.

926
00:38:42.492 --> 00:38:44.425
taking her home to her mother.

927
00:38:44.529 --> 00:38:45.944
Dionne was with us.

928
00:38:46.047 --> 00:38:49.327
And we're all sitting
on that plane.

929
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:51.467
And she's in the
back of the plane.

930
00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:55.712
And my heart went out to
both Gary and to Dionne.

931
00:38:55.816 --> 00:38:57.611
- The phone rang.

932
00:38:57.714 --> 00:38:59.406
And Gary was screaming
and hollering

933
00:38:59.509 --> 00:39:01.822
and all that kind of
business. you know. crying.

934
00:39:01.925 --> 00:39:03.893
And I said.
what's wrong with you?

935
00:39:03.996 --> 00:39:06.067
He couldn't tell me.
He was saying. ah. Nippy. Nippy.

936
00:39:06.171 --> 00:39:08.311
Kept saying. Nippy. Nippy.
I said. what about her?

937
00:39:08.415 --> 00:39:09.795
He said. they found her.

938
00:39:09.899 --> 00:39:13.109
I said. what happened?
She dead?

939
00:39:13.212 --> 00:39:15.111
He said. yes.
Mama. she's dead.

940
00:39:15.214 --> 00:39:17.976
Then my doorbell
rang after a while.

941
00:39:18.079 --> 00:39:20.875

942
00:39:20.979 --> 00:39:23.982
