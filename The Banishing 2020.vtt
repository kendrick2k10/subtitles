3
00:00:43.583 --> 00:00:47.254
For this is God's will.
your sanctification.

4
00:00:47.287 --> 00:00:49.656
that you keep away
from sexual immorality

5
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.925
each of you knows how
to control his own body

6
00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.729
in holiness and honor
not with lustful passions

7
00:00:54.762 --> 00:00:56.964
like the Gentiles
who don't know God.

8
00:00:56.997 --> 00:00:59.333
This means we must not
transgress against

9
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:01.836
or take advantage of a brother
or sister in this manner

10
00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:05.706
because the Lord is an avenger
these offenses.

11
00:01:05.738 --> 00:01:08.442
We know what
commandments we must...

12
00:02:24.917 --> 00:02:26.453
I didn't know who else
to call.

13
00:02:26.487 --> 00:02:28.089
You did the right thing.
Have you told anyone else?

14
00:02:28.122 --> 00:02:30.124
No. but I feel
we're too late.

15
00:03:21.975 --> 00:03:24.043
Jesus Christ.

16
00:03:24.076 --> 00:03:26.679
Jesus Christ!

17
00:03:26.713 --> 00:03:29.150
Clean up what
you can. Dr. Sutter.

18
00:03:31.851 --> 00:03:33.754
And burn the rest.

19
00:06:32.865 --> 00:06:35.902
- Now. be nice.
- Yes. Mummy.

20
00:06:45.045 --> 00:06:47.114
Thank you.

21
00:06:49.016 --> 00:06:50.917
Darling.

22
00:06:52.653 --> 00:06:54.888
Adelaide.

23
00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.261
I'll show you around.

24
00:07:04.864 --> 00:07:06.900
The previous vicar was
the house sitter before us.

25
00:07:06.932 --> 00:07:09.970
but it's been unoccupied
nearly three years now.

26
00:07:11.203 --> 00:07:14.374
As you see. it needs
some attention.

27
00:07:14.408 --> 00:07:16.910
A woman's touch
is all it needs.

28
00:07:19.812 --> 00:07:22.415
Um...

29
00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:25.218
I'm so glad you agreed
to join me here.

30
00:07:27.254 --> 00:07:29.989
Well. of course.

31
00:07:30.023 --> 00:07:32.126
We are married. Linus.

32
00:07:37.797 --> 00:07:39.399
There is electricity.

33
00:07:39.432 --> 00:07:42.235
But i-it's prone to fail.

34
00:08:03.456 --> 00:08:06.392
The housekeeper is
quite the green fingers.

35
00:08:11.263 --> 00:08:12.833
Much of the house has been
closed off to us.

36
00:08:12.865 --> 00:08:16.402
I-I think
it's better that way.

37
00:08:16.436 --> 00:08:19.773
Make a home only in the rooms
we can keep warm.

38
00:08:19.805 --> 00:08:21.941
We'll make it a home
in every room.

39
00:08:40.426 --> 00:08:42.028
How's the church?

40
00:08:42.061 --> 00:08:43.896
It's had no congregation
since Reverend Hall

41
00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:46.333
and his wife moved out
of the country.

42
00:08:46.366 --> 00:08:49.470
I rather fear things
have lapsed in their absence.

43
00:08:49.502 --> 00:08:51.204
I'm sure Malachi has
entrusted me

44
00:08:51.237 --> 00:08:54.974
to bring
the community back.

45
00:08:55.007 --> 00:08:57.210
- Quite the task.
- Linus.

46
00:08:57.243 --> 00:08:58.945
You worry too much.

47
00:08:58.978 --> 00:09:01.715
This will be a success.

48
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:07.487
I. uh... I've asked them
to put some toys in her room.

49
00:09:07.521 --> 00:09:10.757
I hope she will
be happy here.

50
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:13.025
She will be.

51
00:09:13.059 --> 00:09:14.528
This house is wonderful.

52
00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.831
and we will support you
in every way we can.

53
00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.036
Thank you.

54
00:09:24.871 --> 00:09:27.775
Father. we've come to share
a meal in your honor.

55
00:09:27.808 --> 00:09:31.944
Thank you for bringing us
together as a family.

56
00:09:31.977 --> 00:09:33.981
And thank you for this food.

57
00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:40.853
Plus it in our hearts. Lord.

58
00:09:40.886 --> 00:09:42.856
Guide our
mealtime conversations

59
00:09:42.889 --> 00:09:46.894
and steer our hearts
to your presence.

60
00:09:46.926 --> 00:09:50.530
In Jesus Christ's name. amen.

61
00:10:01.607 --> 00:10:03.075
It's very rude to start
eating. Adelaide.

62
00:10:03.108 --> 00:10:05.945
before I've finished Grace.

63
00:10:05.978 --> 00:10:09.016
You need to wait until
I've said the word "amen."

64
00:10:09.049 --> 00:10:10.317
Sorry.

65
00:10:10.349 --> 00:10:14.420
It's all right.
You weren't to know.

66
00:10:26.466 --> 00:10:29.303
- Mommy.
- Hm?

67
00:10:29.335 --> 00:10:31.938
Will you tuck me in
as tight as her?

68
00:10:36.309 --> 00:10:39.280
She's blind. Mommy.

69
00:10:41.948 --> 00:10:43.283
What game was it?

70
00:10:43.315 --> 00:10:45.451
We weren't
playing a game.

71
00:10:45.484 --> 00:10:48.487
Veronica is making
her better.

72
00:10:48.521 --> 00:10:52.259
And who are
these strange fellows.

73
00:10:52.291 --> 00:10:53.860
the ones in
the brown hoods?

74
00:10:53.894 --> 00:10:56.063
I don't know.
She won't tell me.

75
00:10:56.096 --> 00:10:59.333
She says it's private.

76
00:10:59.366 --> 00:11:02.035
Well. maybe she'll tell you
in the morning.

77
00:11:29.963 --> 00:11:31.131
Linus?

78
00:12:04.698 --> 00:12:06.366
Marianne.

79
00:12:06.399 --> 00:12:08.602
Would you?

80
00:12:39.565 --> 00:12:43.102
I thought to begin with.

81
00:12:43.136 --> 00:12:46.073
there were
too many things.

82
00:12:46.106 --> 00:12:49.443
You were traveling.
I had Adie. and I thought...

83
00:12:51.777 --> 00:12:56.215
I just thought
it was a matter of time.

84
00:12:59.084 --> 00:13:02.323
Of course.

85
00:13:06.258 --> 00:13:08.261
We're married.

86
00:13:10.497 --> 00:13:13.700
We should share a bed.

87
00:13:19.805 --> 00:13:24.978
Surely it's God's will that
we should be man and wife.

88
00:13:37.589 --> 00:13:38.691
It's me. isn't it?

89
00:13:38.724 --> 00:13:41.394
No. it's not. I...

90
00:13:46.165 --> 00:13:50.470
I. uh...
I just need time.

91
00:14:17.863 --> 00:14:21.600
"This is the word of God.
your sanctification.

92
00:14:21.633 --> 00:14:24.637
That you abstain
from sexual immorality.

93
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:26.772
that each of you know
how to possess his own vessel

94
00:14:26.805 --> 00:14:30.444
in sanctification and honor.

95
00:14:30.477 --> 00:14:32.746
not in lustful passion."

96
00:14:46.659 --> 00:14:48.595
Linus?

97
00:15:19.825 --> 00:15:22.595
Linus?

98
00:15:49.389 --> 00:15:50.924
Linus?

99
00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:59.626
Linus?

100
00:17:09.501 --> 00:17:14.741
It's probably mice
or rats. no more than that.

101
00:17:16.675 --> 00:17:20.246
Are you talking about
the voices?

102
00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.616
What did you hear?

103
00:17:24.751 --> 00:17:26.786
Nothing.

104
00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:30.656
Adelaide.
what did you hear?

105
00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:32.626
It was nothing.

106
00:17:35.828 --> 00:17:40.700
I saw that in my room.
the pendant.

107
00:17:40.732 --> 00:17:42.469
Betsy. can I see that?

108
00:17:53.646 --> 00:17:55.749
Is it any wonder the
congregation is so small

109
00:17:55.781 --> 00:17:59.386
when superstition
like that's taken hold?

110
00:17:59.418 --> 00:18:01.420
I don't want to see
that again. Betsy.

111
00:18:04.757 --> 00:18:10.363
Why don't you two go into town
this afternoon?

112
00:18:10.396 --> 00:18:12.799
Hm?

113
00:18:12.831 --> 00:18:15.901
I believe they're showing
that Disney film.

114
00:18:15.934 --> 00:18:18.405
Frank will drive you.

115
00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.743
I like your pendant.

116
00:18:24.777 --> 00:18:26.546
Earlier this year.
the land forces of

117
00:18:26.578 --> 00:18:28.815
the Wermacht marched across
the border into Austria.

118
00:18:28.848 --> 00:18:30.582
violating
the Treaty of Versailles

119
00:18:30.616 --> 00:18:32.419
and demonstrating once again
Hitler's aggressive

120
00:18:32.452 --> 00:18:34.020
territorial ambition.

121
00:18:34.052 --> 00:18:36.422
Once there. they received
a rapturous welcome

122
00:18:36.455 --> 00:18:38.425
and cheering
from the people of Austria.

123
00:18:38.457 --> 00:18:41.026
increasing the power
of the German Reich.

124
00:18:41.059 --> 00:18:44.063
Eyes now turn to the Sudetenland
and Czechoslovakia.

125
00:18:44.097 --> 00:18:45.665
Where we'll Hitler's lust
for power and land end?

126
00:18:45.697 --> 00:18:46.932
Come here.

127
00:18:46.965 --> 00:18:49.035
Are we safe on
our fair island?

128
00:18:59.678 --> 00:19:01.013
Do you want to know

129
00:19:01.047 --> 00:19:02.115
what my favorite part
of the film was?

130
00:19:02.147 --> 00:19:03.449
Yes. I do.

131
00:19:03.482 --> 00:19:05.484
The bit when...

132
00:19:15.494 --> 00:19:16.628
Help the war effort!

133
00:19:16.662 --> 00:19:18.465
You think Linus
would like it?

134
00:19:18.498 --> 00:19:21.101
We fight fascists
over there

135
00:19:21.134 --> 00:19:24.537
so you can sleep safe here.

136
00:19:24.569 --> 00:19:27.040
Help the war effort.

137
00:19:29.608 --> 00:19:32.745
Thank you.

138
00:19:34.012 --> 00:19:35.381
Trust you enjoyed
the film. ma'am.

139
00:19:35.415 --> 00:19:37.716
- We did. Frank.
- Ready to leave?

140
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:40.119
You know. there must be some
spare iron around the house.

141
00:19:40.153 --> 00:19:41.954
So much of it
isn't even in use.

142
00:19:41.988 --> 00:19:43.655
- Morning.
- Morning. Reverend.

143
00:19:50.863 --> 00:19:53.467
We fight
fascists over there.

144
00:20:00.973 --> 00:20:04.543
Why does God
allow evil to exist?

145
00:20:07.879 --> 00:20:09.815
Why does he allow war?

146
00:20:12.184 --> 00:20:16.956
There are times. there are times
when we feel his absence.

147
00:20:18.457 --> 00:20:23.929
But Jesus tells us
that he... he warms us.

148
00:20:23.963 --> 00:20:26.165
That's much better.

149
00:20:26.198 --> 00:20:28.867
He warms us...

150
00:20:28.901 --> 00:20:34.541
against taking an eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth

151
00:20:34.573 --> 00:20:39.945
because violence.
it only begets violence.

152
00:20:43.549 --> 00:20:45.484
And violence is a sin.

153
00:20:53.693 --> 00:20:58.798
So our brothers
who died for our country

154
00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:01.067
in the Great War are sinners.
also. are they?

155
00:21:01.099 --> 00:21:02.734
The church is closed.

156
00:21:02.768 --> 00:21:06.005
Everyone is welcome
in the house of God. surely.

157
00:21:06.038 --> 00:21:07.207
War is a sin.

158
00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.608
And what is your
vice I wonder?

159
00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:13.146
How dare you.

160
00:21:13.178 --> 00:21:15.080
you are in no
position to...

161
00:21:15.114 --> 00:21:16.950
Excuse me.

162
00:21:16.982 --> 00:21:21.954
The graves of 10.000 men
was my bed

163
00:21:21.988 --> 00:21:24.924
and my toilet.

164
00:21:24.956 --> 00:21:27.660
For two years.

165
00:21:30.663 --> 00:21:33.766
Might you have also
lived through that hell.

166
00:21:33.799 --> 00:21:38.104
you would not be
so quick to judge. Linus.

167
00:21:38.136 --> 00:21:39.705
How do you know my name?

168
00:21:39.739 --> 00:21:44.810
Oh. I...
I know lots of things.

169
00:21:44.844 --> 00:21:47.280
Forgotten lots
of things. also.

170
00:21:47.312 --> 00:21:48.982
This book

171
00:21:49.014 --> 00:21:51.517
is a history
of the Minassian Order.

172
00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:53.185
an offshoot of
the Augustine.

173
00:21:53.219 --> 00:21:54.787
the black cannon.

174
00:21:54.819 --> 00:21:56.222
The local occupants
of the monastery

175
00:21:56.254 --> 00:21:58.056
that burned down
a long time ago.

176
00:21:58.089 --> 00:22:01.660
You might have heard
of this story.

177
00:22:01.694 --> 00:22:06.132
The house in which you now live
is built on its ruins.

178
00:22:06.165 --> 00:22:07.800
What are you
talking about?

179
00:22:07.832 --> 00:22:09.768
You ever asked yourself
why you're here. Linus?

180
00:22:09.801 --> 00:22:11.905
Bishop Malachi
didn't exactly pick you

181
00:22:11.937 --> 00:22:13.605
for your oratory skills.

182
00:22:13.638 --> 00:22:15.742
So why are you here
at that house?

183
00:22:15.774 --> 00:22:17.276
What purpose is it
you serve?

184
00:22:17.309 --> 00:22:19.111
<i>You</i> are the one
who should not be here.

185
00:22:19.145 --> 00:22:21.013
Have you heard things
in the night. perhaps voices.

186
00:22:21.047 --> 00:22:23.283
whispers. temptations?

187
00:22:23.316 --> 00:22:25.818
Is the house playing tricks
on your wife's mind?

188
00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:27.819
Because it will.

189
00:22:27.853 --> 00:22:30.290
There's a tomb
not so far from here. Linus.

190
00:22:30.322 --> 00:22:32.090
that dates back
to the Minassian Order

191
00:22:32.124 --> 00:22:33.760
of which I spoke.

192
00:22:33.792 --> 00:22:35.727
Two people's bodies
were buried there

193
00:22:35.761 --> 00:22:37.629
three years ago.

194
00:22:37.663 --> 00:22:41.034
Two bodies. on your
Bishop Malachi's orders

195
00:22:41.067 --> 00:22:45.738
in the tomb maintained
by the church.

196
00:22:45.771 --> 00:22:48.074
I believe those bodies belong
to the previous tenants

197
00:22:48.107 --> 00:22:51.010
of your house.
Beatrice and Stanley Hall.

198
00:22:51.042 --> 00:22:52.911
Malachi has lied to you.

199
00:22:52.944 --> 00:22:55.915
The Halls emigrated
to Australia very happily.

200
00:22:55.947 --> 00:22:57.215
If you don't leave
right now.

201
00:22:57.249 --> 00:22:58.785
I'm going to call
the police.

202
00:22:58.818 --> 00:23:00.619
If you do not believe me.
go look in the tomb.

203
00:23:00.653 --> 00:23:02.255
If not for your sake.
for the sake

204
00:23:02.288 --> 00:23:05.925
of the little girl
and your beautiful wife.

205
00:23:05.957 --> 00:23:08.293
How dare you.

206
00:23:08.327 --> 00:23:11.130
Mention my wife!

207
00:23:11.163 --> 00:23:15.768
Beatrice Hall lost her mind
living in that house.

208
00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.936
They said her behavior
was no longer befitting

209
00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:20.973
that of a vicar's wife.

210
00:23:21.007 --> 00:23:23.810
I think it fair to say that
several the local men

211
00:23:23.842 --> 00:23:24.910
may have noticed.

212
00:23:24.944 --> 00:23:27.614
That is why he killed her!

213
00:23:29.648 --> 00:23:32.651
There's also suggestion
that she was with child.

214
00:23:32.684 --> 00:23:34.354
illegitimate. of course.

215
00:23:36.121 --> 00:23:37.322
I don't know what you think
you know.

216
00:23:37.356 --> 00:23:38.857
but the Halls
are alive and well.

217
00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:42.328
and my family is none
of your concern.

218
00:23:51.037 --> 00:23:53.073
Why are you so hungry?

219
00:24:00.913 --> 00:24:03.316
What about you. Uncle Peter?

220
00:24:03.348 --> 00:24:05.851
You haven't eaten anything.

221
00:24:12.191 --> 00:24:14.394
See you're busy.

222
00:24:14.426 --> 00:24:17.396
When you're done.
shall we go and play?

223
00:25:18.323 --> 00:25:21.894
What's the time. Mr. Wolf?

224
00:25:22.962 --> 00:25:25.897
It's... 3:00!

225
00:25:31.103 --> 00:25:34.374
What's the time. Mr. Wolf?

226
00:25:35.774 --> 00:25:36.876
1:00!

227
00:25:42.481 --> 00:25:46.352
What's the time.
Mr. Wolf?

228
00:25:53.024 --> 00:25:54.727
Adie?

229
00:25:59.431 --> 00:26:01.401
Adie?

230
00:26:07.239 --> 00:26:09.409
Adie?

231
00:26:10.041 --> 00:26:11.877
Adie?

232
00:26:14.046 --> 00:26:16.750
Come on. I'm serious now.
Adie?

233
00:26:29.294 --> 00:26:31.230
Adie?

234
00:26:37.435 --> 00:26:39.539
Adie?

235
00:26:40.438 --> 00:26:42.274
Adie?

236
00:26:53.853 --> 00:26:55.822
Adie?

237
00:27:54.078 --> 00:27:56.315
See it?!

238
00:27:56.348 --> 00:27:58.550
Adie!
Do not run away like that.

239
00:27:58.584 --> 00:28:00.319
- Come on.
- Scared you.

240
00:28:00.351 --> 00:28:02.387
Yes. you did.

241
00:28:14.332 --> 00:28:16.301
<i>The president is
with Neville Chamberlain.</i>

242
00:28:16.335 --> 00:28:18.271
<i>Since he took office.
Mr. Chamberlain has never</i>

243
00:28:18.303 --> 00:28:21.139
<i>wavered in his determination
to establish peace in Europe.</i>

244
00:28:21.173 --> 00:28:23.276
<i>As the hour with
the dark clouds of war</i>

245
00:28:23.309 --> 00:28:25.511
<i>hangs most menacingly
above the world's heads.</i>

246
00:28:25.543 --> 00:28:27.612
<i>the prime minister took
a wise and bold decision</i>

247
00:28:27.646 --> 00:28:29.615
<i>to hold the European meetings
in Munich.</i>

248
00:28:29.647 --> 00:28:32.083
<i>History will call him
"Chamberlain the Peacemaker."</i>

249
00:28:32.117 --> 00:28:34.153
<i>The Premiere returned
to England on the same</i>

250
00:28:34.185 --> 00:28:35.954
<i>British Airways plane that
had taken him on</i>

251
00:28:35.988 --> 00:28:38.090
<i>the outward flight.
and he said from the plane.</i>

252
00:28:38.123 --> 00:28:39.492
<i>the Premiere was handed
a special letter</i>

253
00:28:39.524 --> 00:28:41.192
<i>from His Majesty. the King.</i>

254
00:28:41.225 --> 00:28:43.462
<i>Then he faced microphone
and camera once again.</i>

255
00:28:43.494 --> 00:28:46.064
<i>The agreement
signed last night</i>

256
00:28:46.098 --> 00:28:49.034
<i>and the Anglo-German
naval agreement</i>

257
00:28:49.068 --> 00:28:52.570
<i>is symbolic of the desire
of our two peoples</i>

258
00:28:52.604 --> 00:28:55.441
<i>never to go to war
with one another again.</i>

259
00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:27.706
Linus.

260
00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:30.509
Bishop Malachi.

261
00:29:30.541 --> 00:29:33.011
This is
an unexpected honor.

262
00:29:33.044 --> 00:29:35.513
I placed you here.

263
00:29:35.547 --> 00:29:39.552
Surely I'm very much
to be expected.

264
00:29:39.585 --> 00:29:42.555
Most stimulating
conversation. Marianne.

265
00:29:44.757 --> 00:29:47.526
I hope you're both
settling in well.

266
00:29:47.559 --> 00:29:50.229
Yes. Yes.
Thank you. Father.

267
00:29:50.261 --> 00:29:53.031
Personally. I find it
quite disconcerting

268
00:29:53.065 --> 00:29:55.167
to sleep at a place so grand
when so many others in Europe

269
00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.635
are struggling.

270
00:29:56.667 --> 00:29:58.471
Marianne. this is
hardly the time.

271
00:29:58.503 --> 00:30:03.408
No. please.
Marianne speaks her mind.

272
00:30:03.442 --> 00:30:05.511
In difficult times
such as this.

273
00:30:05.543 --> 00:30:09.047
God's grip on his people
is weakened.

274
00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.183
A time when the strength
of the church

275
00:30:11.215 --> 00:30:13.351
is more important than ever.

276
00:30:13.385 --> 00:30:15.121
I'm not sure
the church alone will see us

277
00:30:15.154 --> 00:30:17.223
through what's
happening in the world.

278
00:30:17.255 --> 00:30:20.358
Fascism is truly vile.
Would you not agree?

279
00:30:20.392 --> 00:30:22.462
Marianne.
that's quite enough.

280
00:30:36.075 --> 00:30:37.510
Sorry. Father.

281
00:30:39.078 --> 00:30:41.614
Would you. um...

282
00:30:41.646 --> 00:30:44.349
Would you like to
join me for a drink?

283
00:30:53.459 --> 00:30:55.094
I see you found

284
00:30:55.126 --> 00:30:57.296
Stanley's Bible.

285
00:30:57.328 --> 00:31:00.232
Yes. I was bringing
it to you.

286
00:31:00.264 --> 00:31:03.501
And yet you didn't
know I'd be here.

287
00:31:03.534 --> 00:31:05.637
It's been defaced.

288
00:31:05.671 --> 00:31:08.774
He was a troubled
man at times.

289
00:31:08.807 --> 00:31:10.576
I'm sure the sunshine
of the colonies

290
00:31:10.608 --> 00:31:12.811
is doing him some good.

291
00:31:21.252 --> 00:31:23.321
How's the congregation?

292
00:31:23.355 --> 00:31:26.592
Mm. quiet.
But that will change.

293
00:31:27.658 --> 00:31:32.164
A house. generous stipend.
a far cry from

294
00:31:32.196 --> 00:31:34.500
the wiles of missionary work.
wouldn't you say?

295
00:31:34.532 --> 00:31:36.569
Yes.
it's very generous.

296
00:31:36.601 --> 00:31:41.506
I'm very grateful.

297
00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:43.809
You should be.

298
00:31:48.513 --> 00:31:54.319
She's a spirited woman.
fiery and strong.

299
00:31:54.353 --> 00:31:56.755
Hard to believe
that she could sink so low

300
00:31:56.788 --> 00:31:59.125
as to give
her own daughter away.

301
00:31:59.157 --> 00:32:01.626
Even if she did
take her back.

302
00:32:01.659 --> 00:32:04.629
All those things
that people were saying.

303
00:32:06.397 --> 00:32:09.300
Hell of a thing
you did there.

304
00:32:09.334 --> 00:32:11.470
Really.

305
00:32:11.502 --> 00:32:13.205
Saving her.

306
00:32:16.642 --> 00:32:18.878
I try not to look
at it that way.

307
00:32:27.953 --> 00:32:31.456
Anything you wish
to tell me?

308
00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:33.559
About what?

309
00:32:37.596 --> 00:32:41.232
There has been a man.

310
00:32:41.265 --> 00:32:43.935
A pagan.

311
00:32:43.969 --> 00:32:47.405
He was seen in town
this afternoon.

312
00:32:48.839 --> 00:32:50.775
He's a charlatan.

313
00:32:51.242 --> 00:32:53.646
A storyteller.

314
00:32:53.678 --> 00:32:56.514
His brand of godlessness
is dangerous.

315
00:32:59.684 --> 00:33:01.620
He's known to us.

316
00:33:03.321 --> 00:33:06.725
I thought I'd come sooner
rather than later to warn you.

317
00:33:07.658 --> 00:33:11.229
You see. some people
make a living creating myths

318
00:33:11.262 --> 00:33:14.332
and then selling themselves
as the savior.

319
00:33:18.236 --> 00:33:21.873
Please...

320
00:33:21.906 --> 00:33:25.810
educate yourself

321
00:33:25.844 --> 00:33:29.882
and call me if you
see him again.

322
00:33:32.684 --> 00:33:34.953
I give you my word.

323
00:33:34.986 --> 00:33:37.889
Why would I need
your word?

324
00:33:37.923 --> 00:33:40.760
I have your loyalty.

325
00:34:06.818 --> 00:34:10.689
You shouldn't
let Bishop Malachi get to you.

326
00:34:10.722 --> 00:34:12.992
It's nothing for you
to concern yourself with.

327
00:34:16.727 --> 00:34:19.331
Adelaide. manners.

328
00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:23.901
Men in Colchester
were collecting

329
00:34:23.935 --> 00:34:25.537
for the war in Spain.

330
00:34:25.569 --> 00:34:27.305
What men were those?

331
00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:30.676
Frank Driver
was amongst them.

332
00:34:30.709 --> 00:34:33.479
It's not really any
of our business. Marianne.

333
00:34:33.511 --> 00:34:35.314
They're going to kill us.
aren't they. Mommy?

334
00:34:35.347 --> 00:34:37.348
What do you mean?

335
00:34:37.381 --> 00:34:40.653
The bad men we saw
in the news.

336
00:34:40.685 --> 00:34:45.024
Adelaide. we are
completely safe here.

337
00:34:48.693 --> 00:34:50.061
You shouldn't have let her
see that newsreel.

338
00:34:51.729 --> 00:34:54.365
Perhaps.

339
00:34:54.399 --> 00:34:56.068
But equally.
we shouldn't pretend

340
00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:58.403
that things
aren't happening.

341
00:34:58.437 --> 00:35:00.472
There's no excuse
for doing nothing.

342
00:35:00.504 --> 00:35:02.441
Fascists are taking
controlled by force.

343
00:35:02.473 --> 00:35:03.841
Yes. but to oppose
with force is a sin

344
00:35:03.874 --> 00:35:05.476
of exactly
the same cloth.

345
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:06.944
I can't support
that action.

346
00:35:06.977 --> 00:35:08.546
I've arranged
for a collection.

347
00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:11.917
We'll donate the metal
that's just gathering dust.

348
00:35:14.385 --> 00:35:18.056
Adelaide. why don't you go to
your room and play.

349
00:35:27.665 --> 00:35:30.403
Betsy. stop that for a moment
and leave us. please.

350
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:35.006
Just leave it!

351
00:35:47.151 --> 00:35:48.886
Everything in this house
is the property of

352
00:35:48.919 --> 00:35:50.021
the church. Marianne.

353
00:35:50.055 --> 00:35:51.423
It's not
yours to give away.

354
00:35:51.455 --> 00:35:53.591
That's the end of it.

355
00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.896
I don't want you talking
with men in the town

356
00:35:57.928 --> 00:35:59.564
- like that either.
- I'm sorry.

357
00:35:59.597 --> 00:36:00.965
You're not cohorting
with your artist friends.

358
00:36:00.999 --> 00:36:03.569
You're a vicar's wife now.
You're not some...

359
00:36:06.604 --> 00:36:10.541
Finish that sentence.

360
00:36:10.575 --> 00:36:14.480
You're my wife.

361
00:36:14.513 --> 00:36:16.449
Am I?

362
00:36:17.716 --> 00:36:20.920
Because a deed is worth more
than a word. Linus.

363
00:36:22.153 --> 00:36:25.657
The same way a touch
is worth more than a look.

364
00:36:39.104 --> 00:36:40.973
Adie?

365
00:36:41.539 --> 00:36:43.441
Adie. come on.

366
00:36:45.209 --> 00:36:46.944
Adie.

367
00:37:42.066 --> 00:37:45.838
You're so clever. honey.

368
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:48.906
This is our house.
isn't it?

369
00:37:48.939 --> 00:37:50.541
Do you want to
show me around?

370
00:37:50.575 --> 00:37:54.178
Okay. Um. that's where
the horses stay.

371
00:37:54.211 --> 00:37:56.848
This is the dining room
where they all eat.

372
00:37:56.881 --> 00:38:00.718
And then over there
is the bedroom.

373
00:38:00.752 --> 00:38:02.855
That is
the living room.

374
00:38:02.888 --> 00:38:04.623
This is where
they all play.

375
00:38:04.656 --> 00:38:07.026
and that's baby's room.

376
00:38:14.865 --> 00:38:17.835
What's this room?

377
00:38:17.868 --> 00:38:19.771
Mommy says you're
not to go there.

378
00:38:23.008 --> 00:38:24.843
Excuse me?

379
00:38:24.876 --> 00:38:29.147
Mommy says you're
forbidden to go there.

380
00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:30.848
You're not to look.

381
00:38:30.881 --> 00:38:34.019
Your mommy.

382
00:38:34.051 --> 00:38:35.521
I'm your mommy.

383
00:38:35.553 --> 00:38:37.955
You're not.
You're not my mommy.

384
00:38:37.988 --> 00:38:39.257
Adie. I am your mother.

385
00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:41.760
You're not!
You're a liar!

386
00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:47.765
Adie. will you
look at me?

387
00:38:47.798 --> 00:38:49.867
No!

388
00:38:49.901 --> 00:38:51.036
Adie. look at me
this instant.

389
00:38:51.068 --> 00:38:52.603
No. I will not

390
00:38:52.636 --> 00:38:56.008
- Adie. please.
- No!

391
00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:58.075
Right. Come on.

392
00:38:58.109 --> 00:39:01.146
Get off me! No!

393
00:39:03.814 --> 00:39:05.717
I hate you!

394
00:39:06.283 --> 00:39:09.555
You can be very cruel.
Adie.

395
00:40:38.343 --> 00:40:40.846
Betsy!

396
00:40:46.685 --> 00:40:49.388
Betsy! Betsy!

397
00:40:50.421 --> 00:40:52.057
Oh. God.

398
00:41:22.453 --> 00:41:25.323
No. God!

399
00:41:25.356 --> 00:41:26.925
No.

400
00:41:28.792 --> 00:41:30.928
Linus!

401
00:41:31.296 --> 00:41:33.365
Marianne?

402
00:41:34.932 --> 00:41:38.870
Linus. help me!

403
00:41:40.004 --> 00:41:41.707
Marianne?

404
00:41:53.952 --> 00:41:56.455
Marianne. what is
this nonsense?

405
00:41:56.488 --> 00:41:59.124
Huh?

406
00:41:59.156 --> 00:42:03.127
First Adelaide.
and now this.

407
00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:06.731
Do I need to be
concerned for you both?

408
00:42:06.765 --> 00:42:08.867
Have Betsy clean it up.

409
00:42:19.843 --> 00:42:23.881
I would say stress
on both parts.

410
00:42:23.914 --> 00:42:26.517
It affects adults
in the same way.

411
00:42:26.551 --> 00:42:29.121
Don't upset yourself.

412
00:42:29.153 --> 00:42:31.188
Children are unpredictable
at the best of times.

413
00:42:31.222 --> 00:42:33.825
let alone
after a big upheaval.

414
00:42:33.857 --> 00:42:35.292
Give her time.

415
00:42:35.325 --> 00:42:38.429
Her mind will settle
when she feels more at home.

416
00:42:38.463 --> 00:42:39.930
I'm not overly concerned.

417
00:42:39.964 --> 00:42:42.000
But I am. concerned.
doctor.

418
00:42:42.033 --> 00:42:44.368
Whereabouts are you living.
Mrs. Forster?

419
00:42:44.401 --> 00:42:45.838
Morley Hall.

420
00:42:50.175 --> 00:42:54.345
You're... you're
the vicar's wife.

421
00:42:54.379 --> 00:42:56.848
Yes.
Is that a problem?

422
00:42:59.017 --> 00:43:00.352
No. no.

423
00:43:01.252 --> 00:43:04.256
They shouldn't
be there.

424
00:43:04.289 --> 00:43:06.457
There's a child.

425
00:43:06.490 --> 00:43:09.326
What kind of evil
would allow such a thing?

426
00:43:09.359 --> 00:43:11.463
Same kind that convinces
one good man

427
00:43:11.495 --> 00:43:13.798
to kill another good man.

428
00:43:13.832 --> 00:43:16.401
by telling him
it's the will of God

429
00:43:16.434 --> 00:43:20.071
I swore never to speak about
what I saw that day. but...

430
00:43:20.104 --> 00:43:22.573
I can't sit by and watch
another family die.

431
00:43:22.606 --> 00:43:26.844
I won't allow
that to happen.

432
00:43:26.877 --> 00:43:30.182
- Malachi.
- Stay where you are.

433
00:43:30.214 --> 00:43:34.952
Take a pew.
Welcome to my church. Bishop.

434
00:43:35.854 --> 00:43:38.589
I've been taking confession
from our friend here.

435
00:43:38.622 --> 00:43:42.593
Tells me that truth
is power.

436
00:43:42.627 --> 00:43:44.930
Too much power can corrupt
even the most

437
00:43:44.963 --> 00:43:48.033
peaceful of philosophies.

438
00:43:48.066 --> 00:43:50.301
People. their. uh...

439
00:43:50.334 --> 00:43:56.941
Their minds turn them into.
um... you. Bishop.

440
00:43:56.975 --> 00:44:00.946
You tell me
what you're hiding.

441
00:44:00.979 --> 00:44:02.180
Tell me your secrets.

442
00:44:02.213 --> 00:44:07.017
I said stay where
you are. Dr. Sutter.

443
00:44:07.051 --> 00:44:11.256
You've been taken in
by a fraud and a charlatan.

444
00:44:12.522 --> 00:44:14.291
An occultist
who hides in his world

445
00:44:14.325 --> 00:44:19.598
of fairies
and magic. secrets.

446
00:44:19.631 --> 00:44:22.567
What about that poor girl
in Portsmouth?

447
00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:25.537
Your lies led her into
the marshes. and she drowned.

448
00:44:25.569 --> 00:44:29.341
Didn't she?
You should be in jail.

449
00:44:31.276 --> 00:44:32.644
Well. if that were true.
I would be.

450
00:44:32.676 --> 00:44:37.281
Well. if they had more evidence.
you would be.

451
00:44:39.984 --> 00:44:43.588
Why have you placed another
young couple in that house

452
00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:46.490
after what happened
to the Halls?

453
00:44:46.524 --> 00:44:48.460
Gentry that bequeathed
that house to the church

454
00:44:48.493 --> 00:44:50.929
did so in the belief
that it would be made safe.

455
00:44:50.961 --> 00:44:53.297
not turned into free board
and arching sport

456
00:44:53.330 --> 00:44:56.300
for whatever bloody game
it is you're playing. Bishop.

457
00:44:56.334 --> 00:44:59.671
If you don't leave
this place immediately.

458
00:44:59.703 --> 00:45:05.142
I'll see to it that you're
interred in the darkest cell.

459
00:45:05.176 --> 00:45:08.546
And maybe I'll find
the evidence that they couldn't.

460
00:45:08.578 --> 00:45:10.582
Oh.

461
00:45:10.615 --> 00:45:13.318
Now. that would be
very befitting

462
00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:16.988
your order.
wouldn't it. Bishop?

463
00:45:23.127 --> 00:45:24.362
You...

464
00:45:24.394 --> 00:45:26.030
Find a new friend.

465
00:45:26.064 --> 00:45:28.466
Friend.

466
00:45:28.499 --> 00:45:34.238
Oh. I know all about
your German cohorts. Bishop.

467
00:45:35.573 --> 00:45:37.709
Sieg heil!

468
00:45:37.742 --> 00:45:40.979
Sieg heil! Sieg heil!

469
00:45:43.548 --> 00:45:46.417
That told him.

470
00:45:46.450 --> 00:45:49.655
I believe
it's your round. Doctor.

471
00:46:33.196 --> 00:46:35.200
Where are you?

472
00:46:48.211 --> 00:46:50.348
Help me. please!

473
00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:01.426
Please don't leave me!

474
00:47:01.459 --> 00:47:06.097
I hear you. child.

475
00:47:06.129 --> 00:47:07.698
I hear you.

476
00:47:14.439 --> 00:47:16.607
Where are you?!

477
00:47:17.742 --> 00:47:21.745
Why won't you help me?!

478
00:47:21.778 --> 00:47:25.349
Help me!

479
00:49:15.258 --> 00:49:18.530
Yes. I just
need to rest.

480
00:49:27.405 --> 00:49:30.707
Seeing things.

481
00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:34.378
Yes. yes. I have.
Have you seen things?

482
00:49:34.412 --> 00:49:36.314
A man.

483
00:49:37.647 --> 00:49:39.251
Yes.

484
00:49:59.303 --> 00:50:00.906
Do I go here?

485
00:50:02.807 --> 00:50:05.644
You go.

486
00:50:19.557 --> 00:50:21.259
Hello?

487
00:50:36.406 --> 00:50:41.845
I must apologize.
You find me at low point.

488
00:50:41.879 --> 00:50:44.382
For today. anyhow.

489
00:50:44.414 --> 00:50:45.849
Clearly this was a mistake.

490
00:50:45.883 --> 00:50:50.722
Mrs. Forster. you've come
for a reason. have you not?

491
00:50:50.754 --> 00:50:55.626
Have you seen things
in the house. perhaps?

492
00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:59.797
Have you seen the monk?

493
00:50:59.830 --> 00:51:01.967
I know you have.

494
00:51:05.435 --> 00:51:06.937
Betsy's the one that
contacted me.

495
00:51:06.970 --> 00:51:10.742
She's a very old
and dear friend of mine.

496
00:51:11.441 --> 00:51:13.477
Can I show you something?

497
00:51:24.455 --> 00:51:29.394
I've been investigating
your house for some time now.

498
00:51:30.694 --> 00:51:33.430
This book is a history
of the Minassian Order's

499
00:51:33.464 --> 00:51:36.934
sick perversion
of the Christian faith.

500
00:51:36.966 --> 00:51:39.636
The grounds of your house
now rest on what remains

501
00:51:39.669 --> 00:51:41.838
of its legacy.

502
00:51:41.872 --> 00:51:44.341
They believed
in punishment for sin.

503
00:51:44.374 --> 00:51:49.012
that torture would
bring them closer to God.

504
00:51:49.046 --> 00:51:52.450
If the book is correct
and to be believed.

505
00:51:52.482 --> 00:51:54.551
then the deeds
of the monastery

506
00:51:54.584 --> 00:51:59.323
have had a profound effect
on the grounds of your house.

507
00:52:14.071 --> 00:52:18.443
Why have you married a vicar
and yet. you have had a child.

508
00:52:18.475 --> 00:52:22.046
your daughter.
born out of wedlock.

509
00:52:23.414 --> 00:52:24.381
Adie's my sister's...

510
00:52:24.414 --> 00:52:27.651
No. No. she's not.

511
00:52:27.685 --> 00:52:30.788
This is a lie you tell.
a story that you sell to others.

512
00:52:30.821 --> 00:52:33.458
Do not deceive yourself.
Mrs. Forster.

513
00:52:33.490 --> 00:52:38.061
Denial is the teet on
which the Beast will suckle.

514
00:52:38.095 --> 00:52:39.530
I beg your pardon.

515
00:52:39.562 --> 00:52:42.767
Your breast. the tit.

516
00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:45.035
I would apologize. but time
is running out for you

517
00:52:45.068 --> 00:52:47.504
and for your family.

518
00:52:47.537 --> 00:52:50.874
The house you live in
feeds upon the charade

519
00:52:50.908 --> 00:52:53.712
that you show to others.

520
00:52:56.513 --> 00:53:01.952
We're only our true selves
when we're alone. are we not?

521
00:53:01.986 --> 00:53:04.388
Do you understand?

522
00:53:04.421 --> 00:53:07.657
This house turns children
against their parents.

523
00:53:07.691 --> 00:53:10.962
husbands against
their wives.

524
00:53:10.995 --> 00:53:16.467
This evil lurks
in the long shadow of shame.

525
00:53:16.499 --> 00:53:18.402
Who are you?

526
00:53:20.838 --> 00:53:23.508
No.

527
00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:25.676
Who are <i>you?</i>

528
00:53:27.977 --> 00:53:34.084
When the darkness closes in
and all light is gone

529
00:53:34.118 --> 00:53:38.156
and all you can smell
is your own fear...

530
00:53:41.992 --> 00:53:45.129
...will you remember
who you are?

531
00:53:46.497 --> 00:53:50.968
The shame of your
illegitimate child haunts you.

532
00:53:51.001 --> 00:53:55.607
If you don't leave that house.
the shame will kill you.

533
00:53:57.841 --> 00:54:01.578
Take the book.
speak to your husband.

534
00:54:03.948 --> 00:54:06.651
For the sake of your daughter.

535
00:54:06.684 --> 00:54:09.586
get out of that house
before it's too late.

536
00:55:42.046 --> 00:55:43.948
Marianne?

537
00:56:02.999 --> 00:56:04.635
Marianne?

538
00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:42.173
Where have you been?

539
00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:45.842
Am I not permitted
to freely walk

540
00:56:45.876 --> 00:56:47.044
around the parish?

541
00:56:47.077 --> 00:56:48.812
Am I not permitted
an answer?

542
00:56:48.845 --> 00:56:50.780
Not when you speak
with an accuser's tongue.

543
00:56:50.814 --> 00:56:53.318
- What's that?
- Answers possibly.

544
00:56:54.685 --> 00:56:56.854
Has that charlatan been
to see you?

545
00:56:56.886 --> 00:57:00.725
There is something strange
about this house. Linus.

546
00:57:00.758 --> 00:57:02.960
I have seen things.
felt things.

547
00:57:02.993 --> 00:57:04.328
Have you not?

548
00:57:04.361 --> 00:57:08.132
That man... That man is
a fraud. Marianne.

549
00:57:08.164 --> 00:57:11.234
He... he poisons people's minds
w-with superstition.

550
00:57:11.267 --> 00:57:13.903
Was it he poisoned
your mind?

551
00:57:13.937 --> 00:57:15.139
- No.
- Give me the book!

552
00:57:15.171 --> 00:57:17.007
Or what?!

553
00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:19.876
You'll become violent.

554
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:21.178
It's a shame.

555
00:57:21.211 --> 00:57:24.182
Only jealousy
fuels your passion.

556
00:57:47.738 --> 00:57:52.376
"And when Jesus cried out
again in a loud voice.

557
00:57:52.408 --> 00:57:55.312
he gave up his spirit."

558
00:58:04.421 --> 00:58:07.925
"At that moment.
the curtain of the Temple..."

559
00:58:15.865 --> 00:58:17.734
Uh...

560
00:58:17.767 --> 00:58:22.272
"At that moment.
the curtain of the temple

561
00:58:22.305 --> 00:58:25.842
was torn in two from top ..."

562
00:58:58.542 --> 00:59:00.877
Hello. Marianne.

563
00:59:00.910 --> 00:59:02.946
You'll find
Linus in the church.

564
00:59:02.979 --> 00:59:04.781
I know.

565
00:59:07.484 --> 00:59:10.386
It's you I want to speak with
on a personal matter.

566
00:59:10.419 --> 00:59:13.156
I have no secrets
from my husband.

567
00:59:13.189 --> 00:59:15.792
Yes. you do.

568
00:59:15.825 --> 00:59:19.195
None that
I would tell you.

569
00:59:19.229 --> 00:59:23.234
Linus doesn't know about
your confession. now does he?

570
00:59:23.267 --> 00:59:27.905
A Protestant girl giving
confession to a Catholic priest.

571
00:59:30.106 --> 00:59:31.975
That was a long time ago.
I was ill.

572
00:59:32.008 --> 00:59:34.344
You were pregnant.

573
00:59:34.377 --> 00:59:37.113
Shamed by the sin
of your flesh.

574
00:59:37.147 --> 00:59:39.917
unable to return
to your family.

575
00:59:40.917 --> 00:59:44.187
A hospital for the mentally
infirm your new home.

576
00:59:46.990 --> 00:59:49.827
What is it that you
could tell a priest

577
00:59:49.859 --> 00:59:52.262
that you couldn't
tell a doctor?

578
00:59:55.399 --> 00:59:59.170
The doctor told me
that Adie had died inside me.

579
00:59:59.202 --> 01:00:00.905
That's why I became ill.

580
01:00:00.937 --> 01:00:02.405
They told me
she had to be removed.

581
01:00:02.439 --> 01:00:05.876
They were lying.
I felt her kick.

582
01:00:05.908 --> 01:00:09.078
And I did not ask
for confession.

583
01:00:09.111 --> 01:00:10.414
I asked for the priest
to hide me

584
01:00:10.446 --> 01:00:11.915
until she was born.

585
01:00:11.948 --> 01:00:14.017
Well. he didn't.
did he?

586
01:00:16.419 --> 01:00:20.390
He called the hospital.
and they proclaimed you mad.

587
01:00:20.423 --> 01:00:23.526
They couldn't abort.
Priest saw to that.

588
01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:26.197
That the child was born
and taken from you.

589
01:00:30.267 --> 01:00:32.102
Why ask if you
already know?

590
01:00:32.135 --> 01:00:34.839
What I need you
to understand

591
01:00:34.872 --> 01:00:37.308
is how you got Adie back.

592
01:00:37.341 --> 01:00:39.310
You see. as well as
calling the hospital.

593
01:00:39.343 --> 01:00:42.879
the priest called me.
and I came to visit you there.

594
01:00:42.912 --> 01:00:45.882
Do you remember?

595
01:00:45.915 --> 01:00:50.955
You were heavily sedated.
confused.

596
01:00:50.988 --> 01:00:53.524
But mad. Oh.

597
01:00:55.892 --> 01:00:59.129
You were a mother
in need of her child.

598
01:01:01.097 --> 01:01:06.135
It was I who got
your daughter back.

599
01:01:06.169 --> 01:01:09.006
And I called the orphanage
and convinced them

600
01:01:09.039 --> 01:01:12.042
that a mission I was running
could care for you both.

601
01:01:12.075 --> 01:01:15.980
It was there that
you met Linus.

602
01:01:16.013 --> 01:01:19.250
What is it you want?

603
01:01:19.283 --> 01:01:23.187
I know the company
you've been keeping of late.

604
01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:27.558
I do not want you
to listen to his lies.

605
01:01:27.591 --> 01:01:32.063
And I do not want you
to leave this house.

606
01:01:34.031 --> 01:01:36.634
You see.
I placed you here.

607
01:01:36.667 --> 01:01:39.203
Not because of your husband.
but because of you.

608
01:01:39.236 --> 01:01:44.174
And I need to feel like
I made the correct decision.

609
01:01:44.207 --> 01:01:46.176
Do you understand?

610
01:01:46.209 --> 01:01:49.914
Now we both have Adelaide's
best interests at heart...

611
01:01:49.946 --> 01:01:53.651
a happy and loving home
here at Morley Hall.

612
01:01:56.319 --> 01:02:01.559
Now. if she were to leave.
I cannot ensure that safety.

613
01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:06.396
God returns
your daughter to you.

614
01:02:09.566 --> 01:02:12.169
God can also take her.

615
01:02:44.667 --> 01:02:46.503
Adie?

616
01:02:51.073 --> 01:02:52.943
Adie?

617
01:02:54.343 --> 01:02:56.546
Adie?

618
01:03:03.519 --> 01:03:05.021
Adie?

619
01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:16.032
Adie?

620
01:03:25.107 --> 01:03:27.243
Adie?

621
01:03:41.490 --> 01:03:43.626
I'm in no mood for games.

622
01:03:51.435 --> 01:03:53.404
Adie. where are you?

623
01:03:53.437 --> 01:03:56.707
Come in.
Quick.

624
01:04:02.812 --> 01:04:04.781
Adie?

625
01:04:28.437 --> 01:04:30.673
Adie?

626
01:04:30.707 --> 01:04:32.676
No! I don't want it!

627
01:04:34.477 --> 01:04:37.347
Adie?

628
01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:51.861
Marianne...

629
01:04:51.894 --> 01:04:54.797
You don't know.
You're my mommy.

630
01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:05.575
No!

631
01:05:38.707 --> 01:05:41.778
Go away!
Please. make her go away!

632
01:05:41.810 --> 01:05:44.180
Make her go away.
please!

633
01:06:05.202 --> 01:06:06.736
Why didn't you
answer me earlier?

634
01:06:06.769 --> 01:06:08.171
I was calling for you.

635
01:06:08.205 --> 01:06:09.506
I can't find
Veronica anywhere.

636
01:06:09.539 --> 01:06:10.774
Did you take her?

637
01:06:10.807 --> 01:06:13.276
Of course not.

638
01:06:14.544 --> 01:06:17.214
I don't want you playing
with these anymore.

639
01:06:26.423 --> 01:06:28.492
Marianne?

640
01:06:30.392 --> 01:06:32.628
Don't call me that.

641
01:06:32.662 --> 01:06:34.665
Mommy says you're going
to take us away from here.

642
01:06:34.698 --> 01:06:36.633
that you're
going to leave Linus.

643
01:06:36.665 --> 01:06:39.403
Is that true?

644
01:06:39.435 --> 01:06:40.571
Go to sleep.

645
01:06:40.604 --> 01:06:43.506
I don't want
to leave this house!

646
01:06:43.539 --> 01:06:45.875
Go to sleep.

647
01:07:17.006 --> 01:07:18.742
Aaah!

648
01:07:32.522 --> 01:07:34.391
Adie.

649
01:07:34.423 --> 01:07:36.325
How did you...

650
01:07:36.359 --> 01:07:38.362
Adie?

651
01:07:39.629 --> 01:07:43.634
Adie.
what are you doing up there?

652
01:07:49.406 --> 01:07:51.675
Shh.

653
01:08:57.740 --> 01:09:00.310
Adie?

654
01:09:14.790 --> 01:09:17.127
Adie!

655
01:09:17.159 --> 01:09:19.095
Adie!

656
01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:27.604
Linus. Adie's gone.
and I...

657
01:09:27.637 --> 01:09:29.439
Oh. my God.
What are you doing?!

658
01:09:29.471 --> 01:09:31.507
Was she taken
by the house?

659
01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:34.543
Did... did the house
make you do what you did. too?

660
01:09:34.577 --> 01:09:36.046
Linus. stop it.
I need your help.

661
01:09:36.079 --> 01:09:38.582
I bet it was
the fucking house.

662
01:09:53.896 --> 01:09:57.033
Mr. Reed. can you help me?
Adie's gone.

663
01:09:57.065 --> 01:09:59.101
She's disappeared.
Can you find her?

664
01:09:59.135 --> 01:10:01.104
Yes. I believe I can.
but if we are to find her.

665
01:10:01.137 --> 01:10:04.574
we must... we have to see
the light on her face-to-face.

666
01:10:04.606 --> 01:10:07.577
We must go into the darkness
of which I spoke.

667
01:10:07.610 --> 01:10:08.845
Can you do this with me?

668
01:10:08.878 --> 01:10:10.681
- Yes.
- And your husband?

669
01:10:13.182 --> 01:10:15.651
Betsy!

670
01:10:22.659 --> 01:10:24.428
She's deaf.

671
01:10:30.132 --> 01:10:31.734
I've got a maid. you know?

672
01:10:31.767 --> 01:10:35.704
Mm. She's deaf.

673
01:10:35.738 --> 01:10:38.609
Deaf as a post.

674
01:10:40.543 --> 01:10:43.847
I've got a deaf maid.

675
01:10:43.879 --> 01:10:48.584
And a wife who is completely.
completely mad.

676
01:10:50.052 --> 01:10:51.888
Lord. help me.

677
01:10:59.695 --> 01:11:02.698
Will you find
my fucking maid?

678
01:11:12.876 --> 01:11:14.811
- Adie?
- Shh.

679
01:11:36.999 --> 01:11:41.939
What have they done to you?

680
01:11:57.753 --> 01:12:00.556
You're not there anymore.

681
01:12:02.859 --> 01:12:04.727
Goodbye.

682
01:12:17.339 --> 01:12:20.677
Clean it up.
Clean it up.

683
01:12:20.709 --> 01:12:24.013
Clean it up.
Clean it up. Clean it up.

684
01:12:24.047 --> 01:12:25.915
Clean it up.
Clean it up.

685
01:12:25.949 --> 01:12:28.084
Do not get too close.
Ms. Forster.

686
01:12:28.117 --> 01:12:30.320
Clean it up.
Clean it up.

687
01:12:30.352 --> 01:12:33.088
Believe me when I say

688
01:12:33.122 --> 01:12:36.860
your husband
did not kill Betsy.

689
01:12:37.627 --> 01:12:40.931
He is a victim of this house.
as was she.

690
01:12:40.963 --> 01:12:46.802
Beholden to its powers
and now held in its trance.

691
01:12:46.836 --> 01:12:49.873
Clean it up.
Clean it up.

692
01:12:49.905 --> 01:12:56.212
This house is now repeating with
you what did it with the Halls.

693
01:13:00.016 --> 01:13:01.885
Where's Adie?

694
01:13:01.918 --> 01:13:04.054
Linus. where's Adie?

695
01:13:04.087 --> 01:13:06.356
Linus. where's Adie?

696
01:13:06.388 --> 01:13:08.158
Clean it up.
Clean it up.

697
01:13:08.190 --> 01:13:10.693
Go and find
something of your daughter's

698
01:13:10.726 --> 01:13:15.264
that was precious to her
so that we might still. still

699
01:13:15.297 --> 01:13:16.665
tempt her back to us.

700
01:13:16.699 --> 01:13:20.803
- Her doll.
- Yes. very good.

701
01:13:20.837 --> 01:13:23.373
Clean it up.
Clean it up. Clean it up.

702
01:13:23.405 --> 01:13:25.240
- Oh.
- Clean it up.

703
01:13:25.274 --> 01:13:28.878
Clean it up I will
indeed. Linus.

704
01:13:57.172 --> 01:13:59.309
Hide your eyes. Linus.

705
01:13:59.342 --> 01:14:02.212
Are you in sight
into the cracks

706
01:14:02.244 --> 01:14:03.946
and the crevices
of this house.

707
01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:07.017
It's history. it's terrible.
terrible history

708
01:14:07.050 --> 01:14:09.052
that has bewitched you.

709
01:14:09.084 --> 01:14:12.055
Look past what this house
is showing you.

710
01:14:12.087 --> 01:14:15.324
Look into the dark center
of the beyond.

711
01:14:16.693 --> 01:14:19.896
Let me into your mind.

712
01:14:19.928 --> 01:14:22.699
Show me what you see.

713
01:14:46.989 --> 01:14:48.859
Linus.

714
01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:53.764
Leave him.

715
01:15:01.471 --> 01:15:06.376
This house is cursed.
Mrs. Forster.

716
01:15:08.811 --> 01:15:13.348
We all admitted it
many years ago.

717
01:15:13.382 --> 01:15:19.756
The monks tortured and mutilated
a woman in this house.

718
01:15:19.788 --> 01:15:23.926
The woman now holds your
daughter as revenge

719
01:15:23.959 --> 01:15:28.265
against the church
that did torment her.

720
01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:34.803
The monks come of
the Minassian Order

721
01:15:34.837 --> 01:15:37.941
are coming for you.

722
01:15:37.973 --> 01:15:43.747
As they did
that poor. poor woman.

723
01:15:48.517 --> 01:15:50.921
They ripped her open...

724
01:15:53.321 --> 01:15:55.992
...because she was pregnant.

725
01:15:58.828 --> 01:16:01.464
A child.

726
01:16:04.801 --> 01:16:06.468
With their child.

727
01:16:06.502 --> 01:16:09.939
They abandoned it down there
in the darkness.

728
01:16:09.971 --> 01:16:13.075
blinded the woman
to hide their shame.

729
01:16:14.177 --> 01:16:17.981
Now this poor. ghostly soul
has taken Adelaide as her own.

730
01:16:19.815 --> 01:16:21.416
Do you love your husband.
Mrs. Forster?

731
01:16:21.449 --> 01:16:24.119
- Yes.
- And do you trust me?

732
01:16:24.153 --> 01:16:26.823
Yes.

733
01:16:26.855 --> 01:16:29.024
Out! Out!

734
01:16:35.897 --> 01:16:39.836
Are you there?
I see you.

735
01:16:39.869 --> 01:16:44.107
Good for now.
But we must make haste.

736
01:16:44.873 --> 01:16:49.278
She had a child down there
in the darkness.

737
01:16:49.311 --> 01:16:50.979
It can't have survived
down there.

738
01:16:51.012 --> 01:16:54.950
That is why she now
claims yours as her own.

739
01:16:57.253 --> 01:16:58.955
Tell her. brave.

740
01:16:58.988 --> 01:17:01.257
Was there a ritual.
was it not. Linus?

741
01:17:01.289 --> 01:17:04.359
The absence of light.

742
01:17:04.392 --> 01:17:06.029
Do you know this ritual?

743
01:17:06.061 --> 01:17:08.463
I do.

744
01:17:08.497 --> 01:17:11.868
Then we must use it
to enter the beyond.

745
01:17:23.579 --> 01:17:25.915
From the sixth hour.

746
01:17:25.948 --> 01:17:29.985
there was darkness
all over the land.

747
01:17:30.019 --> 01:17:32.454
At about the ninth hour.

748
01:17:32.488 --> 01:17:38.427
Jesus cried out in a loud voice
and gave up his spirit.

749
01:17:41.931 --> 01:17:44.934
He said...

750
01:17:44.967 --> 01:17:48.638
"Wouldst thou be willing to
lay down my life for another.

751
01:17:48.671 --> 01:17:51.941
less worthy?

752
01:17:51.973 --> 01:17:58.513
Hast thou ever felt
the pain of abandonment. agony?

753
01:17:58.547 --> 01:18:02.552
Oh. God. why hast
Thou forsaken me?"

754
01:18:07.455 --> 01:18:10.525
Mommy says
you're forbidden to go there.

755
01:18:10.559 --> 01:18:13.029
You're not to look.

756
01:19:24.432 --> 01:19:25.635
It is my sister's

757
01:19:25.668 --> 01:19:28.738
No.
No. she's not.

758
01:19:28.770 --> 01:19:32.007
It is a lie you tell.
a story that you say to others

759
01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:34.110
to deceive yourself.

760
01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:55.999
The child was born
and taken from you.

761
01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:02.204
It was I who got
your daughter back.

762
01:20:18.486 --> 01:20:21.690
What's the time.
Mr. Wolf?

763
01:21:06.534 --> 01:21:08.104
Adie!

764
01:21:08.137 --> 01:21:12.508
Give me my daughter!
Give me...

765
01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:16.244
Please. please. please!

766
01:21:22.485 --> 01:21:25.388
Please. please.

767
01:21:29.458 --> 01:21:31.561
Sinner.

768
01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:33.462
Confess.

769
01:21:33.495 --> 01:21:35.230
No!

770
01:21:35.698 --> 01:21:40.302
Confess your
filthy dirty ass.

771
01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:48.410
Poor...

772
01:21:48.444 --> 01:21:50.847
heretic...

773
01:21:50.879 --> 01:21:53.382
slut.

774
01:21:56.217 --> 01:21:57.854
I am a woman.

775
01:21:59.288 --> 01:22:00.756
A mother.

776
01:22:00.788 --> 01:22:02.691
And I do not regret
the beautiful night

777
01:22:02.725 --> 01:22:05.128
I spent
with Adie's father.

778
01:22:07.428 --> 01:22:09.699
In fact. I cherish it.

779
01:22:52.507 --> 01:22:57.512
Bless me father.
for I have sinned!

780
01:23:04.954 --> 01:23:08.358
Sin of the flesh!

781
01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:16.298
I will not hide in shame.

782
01:23:16.332 --> 01:23:18.700
Or mutilate my face.
as you've done.

783
01:23:18.734 --> 01:23:21.604
Because I feel no shame.

784
01:23:26.408 --> 01:23:28.511
You destroy your face because
you cannot look in the mirror

785
01:23:28.543 --> 01:23:30.879
and see the man that
once were.

786
01:23:33.414 --> 01:23:36.885
But I see you.

787
01:23:36.918 --> 01:23:40.522
I see a brother.

788
01:23:40.556 --> 01:23:42.391
A father.

789
01:23:42.423 --> 01:23:45.394
A son.

790
01:23:45.427 --> 01:23:48.498
I see three shameful men.

791
01:23:55.770 --> 01:23:57.973
And I pity you.

792
01:24:29.704 --> 01:24:32.574
Please. whoever you are...

793
01:24:32.607 --> 01:24:35.043
please just
give my daughter back.

794
01:24:49.725 --> 01:24:51.694
Adie?

795
01:24:58.100 --> 01:25:01.870
Adie? Sweetheart.

796
01:25:03.672 --> 01:25:06.309
- Shh.
- Adie!

797
01:25:12.448 --> 01:25:14.717
Adie?

798
01:25:16.118 --> 01:25:17.986
Adie?

799
01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:48.583
What's the time. Mr. Wolf?

800
01:25:49.485 --> 01:25:51.554
It's 3:00.

801
01:25:58.726 --> 01:26:01.863
What's the time.
Mr. Wolf?

802
01:26:01.896 --> 01:26:04.566
It's 2:00.

803
01:26:18.446 --> 01:26:20.917
What's the time. Mr. Wolf?

804
01:26:29.024 --> 01:26:31.627
It's dinner time.

805
01:26:43.004 --> 01:26:47.944
I'll see to it that your child
gets a proper burial.

806
01:26:48.543 --> 01:26:51.646
Burial in the eyes of God.

807
01:26:54.149 --> 01:26:57.086
You deserve so much more.

808
01:27:02.223 --> 01:27:04.494
You have my word.

809
01:27:06.128 --> 01:27:08.898
We will treat you
and your daughter

810
01:27:08.931 --> 01:27:11.868
with such care.

811
01:27:13.502 --> 01:27:15.738
History will be rewritten.

812
01:27:18.507 --> 01:27:20.977
Let them play.

813
01:28:00.214 --> 01:28:02.584
Can she have my dolly?

814
01:28:03.051 --> 01:28:05.521
So she has something
to play with.

815
01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:07.589
Yes.

816
01:28:07.623 --> 01:28:10.026
I think she'd like that.

817
01:28:54.035 --> 01:28:56.305
Almighty and eternal God.

818
01:28:56.337 --> 01:28:58.806
from whose love in Christ
we cannot be parted

819
01:28:58.839 --> 01:29:01.877
either in life or death.

820
01:29:01.909 --> 01:29:04.245
hear our thoughts
and thanks giving

821
01:29:04.279 --> 01:29:07.149
for those that
we remember today.

822
01:29:07.181 --> 01:29:09.784
Fulfilling them
the promise of your love

823
01:29:09.818 --> 01:29:13.722
and bring us all with them
to Your eternal joy.

824
01:29:13.754 --> 01:29:15.790
Through Jesus Christ our lord.

825
01:29:15.824 --> 01:29:17.927
amen.

826
01:30:14.682 --> 01:30:16.651
It's Malachi.

827
01:30:16.685 --> 01:30:18.954
I was right.

828
01:30:18.986 --> 01:30:21.257
The girl found the bones.

829
01:30:23.824 --> 01:30:26.060
Wilheim.

830
01:30:26.093 --> 01:30:27.863
You old goat.

831
01:30:28.663 --> 01:30:30.699
How are you?

832
01:30:37.038 --> 01:30:41.943
In Him. we have redemption
through His blood.

833
01:30:41.976 --> 01:30:44.912
The forgiveness
of our trespasses

834
01:30:44.945 --> 01:30:48.883
according to the riches
of His grace.

835
01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:59.360
As our prime minister is doing
all he can to avoid war

836
01:30:59.394 --> 01:31:04.098
with Herr Hitler. to resolve
this crisis of nationalism

837
01:31:04.132 --> 01:31:07.002
that's threatening
to engulf all of Europe.

838
01:31:07.034 --> 01:31:09.671
I have had many of you asked me
if I can help them

839
01:31:09.704 --> 01:31:11.707
to pray for peace.

840
01:31:13.975 --> 01:31:17.178
And peace is a... it's good.

841
01:31:17.212 --> 01:31:20.415
It's a noble thing to pray for.

842
01:31:22.751 --> 01:31:25.687
But the only thing that's
necessary for evil to triumph

843
01:31:25.721 --> 01:31:29.324
is for good men to do nothing.

844
01:31:29.356 --> 01:31:35.730
That darkness that comes when
we fail to uphold the light.

845
01:31:35.763 --> 01:31:38.833
when we are driven by fear
and blame others

846
01:31:38.867 --> 01:31:41.003
for the shortcomings
in ourselves.

847
01:31:41.035 --> 01:31:46.007
when we exploit what divides us
instead of what unites us.

848
01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:51.012
let us pray this evil
does not spread further.

849
01:31:51.046 --> 01:31:54.482
Our Father who art in heaven

850
01:31:54.516 --> 01:31:56.919
hallowed be thy name.

851
01:31:56.952 --> 01:32:00.122
thy kingdom come.
thy will be done.

852
01:32:00.154 --> 01:32:02.957
on earth as it is in Heaven.

853
01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:06.127
Give us this day...
