00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:12.572
<i>¡Buenas noches!</i>

7
00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:14.607
And welcome to the Hollywood Bowl!

8
00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:20.313
My name is Lin-Manuel Miranda.

9
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.683
Together with the Oscar-nominated composer
Germaine Franco.

10
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.853
we are responsible
for the music of <i>Encanto.</i>

11
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.521
(cheering continues)

12
00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:30.457
So I'm incredibly proud to be a part

13
00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:33.393
of Walt Disney Animation's
60th feature film

14
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.894
and thrilled to help celebrate

15
00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:37.664
the Walt Disney company's
100-year anniversary.

16
00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:41.968
All of us working on <i>Encanto.</i>
the writers. the directors. the animators.

17
00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:42.936
we had one goal:

18
00:01:43.336 --> 00:01:47.607
To bring the journey of this amazing.
multigenerational Columbian family

19
00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:51.478
to the screen
with all its complexity and talent.

20
00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:55.482
We all brought our own family stories
to the table during production

21
00:01:55.548 --> 00:01:58.651
with all our culture.
and quirks. and specificities.

22
00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:02.188
We hope that you would see
a little of your own family

23
00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:03.723
in the Madrigal family.

24
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.127
that you would hear a little
of your own story in these songs.

25
00:02:07.827 --> 00:02:12.432
I don't think anyone anticipated
a global phenomenon and a concert

26
00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:14.167
at the Hollywood Bowl.

27
00:02:15.034 --> 00:02:17.137
(cheering continues)

28
00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:21.474
Now. tonight we have an evening of firsts.

29
00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:23.676
We made this film during the pandemic.

30
00:02:23.743 --> 00:02:26.012
so this is the first time
the original cast

31
00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.914
have sung these songs together

32
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:31.584
on the same stage at the same time live.

33
00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:33.386
Tonight. for the first time.

34
00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:36.189
we are joined
by amazing Columbian artists.

35
00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:39.926
Andrés Cepeda
and the immortal Carlos Vives.

36
00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:42.395
(cheering continues)

37
00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:49.068
And selfishly. I've heard about
Hollywood Bowl concerts my entire life.

38
00:02:49.135 --> 00:02:51.804
but I'm from Washington Heights.
so I wanted to tell you.

39
00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:54.407
this is my first time
at the Hollywood Bowl.

40
00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:56.342
(cheering continues)

41
00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.612
Now. I wanted the show
to be really special tonight.

42
00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.648
so we built a <i>casita</i>.

43
00:03:01.714 --> 00:03:04.517
