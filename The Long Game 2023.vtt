Told '’em about us.

546
00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.021
Yeah. he hasn'’t stopped
talking about you for days.

547
00:23:57.159 --> 00:23:58.471
Weeks.

548
00:23:58.609 --> 00:24:00.231
He hasn'’t stopped talking
about you for weeks.

549
00:24:01.267 --> 00:24:04.270
Next day I go to the infirmary

550
00:24:04.408 --> 00:24:06.375
and I can barely look
those boys in the eye

551
00:24:06.514 --> 00:24:08.895
after the wringer we
put '’em through.

552
00:24:09.033 --> 00:24:10.207
I'’m just about to leave

553
00:24:10.345 --> 00:24:12.727
and I hear this
little voice just go.

554
00:24:12.865 --> 00:24:14.418
"Sir.

555
00:24:14.556 --> 00:24:15.488
sir."

556
00:24:15.626 --> 00:24:16.938
Like that.

557
00:24:17.076 --> 00:24:18.526
I was not that bad.

558
00:24:18.664 --> 00:24:19.768
I was not that bad.
- Trust me.

559
00:24:19.906 --> 00:24:21.252
you were in pretty bad shape.

560
00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:24.221
So I go over there and
I lean down. you know.

561
00:24:24.359 --> 00:24:25.843
I think he'’s gonna
to give me a letter

562
00:24:25.981 --> 00:24:28.397
for his mama or
something like that.

563
00:24:28.536 --> 00:24:30.089
And he says. "Sir.

564
00:24:30.227 --> 00:24:33.230
aren'’t you Frank Mitchell.
the golf pro?"

565
00:24:33.368 --> 00:24:36.785
This crazy bastard starts
asking me for putting tips.

566
00:24:36.923 --> 00:24:39.029
No. no. no. that was
the next day. ass.

567
00:24:39.167 --> 00:24:40.064
Oh no it wasn'’t.

568
00:24:40.202 --> 00:24:41.549
So what did you tell him?

569
00:24:41.687 --> 00:24:43.482
I gave him golf tips.
all up the boot of Italy.

570
00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:44.586
What was I gonna do?

571
00:24:44.724 --> 00:24:45.932
I can'’t say no to the guy.

572
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:47.451
Still can'’t.

573
00:24:47.589 --> 00:24:49.211
Oh. come on. when do
I ask you for anything?

574
00:24:49.349 --> 00:24:50.212
Oh. come on.

575
00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:51.490
- Seriously-
- Look at him.

576
00:24:51.628 --> 00:24:52.905
He almost believes it himself.

577
00:24:53.043 --> 00:24:54.389
[ladies chuckle]

578
00:24:54.527 --> 00:24:56.253
So JB. Frank tells me

579
00:24:56.391 --> 00:24:59.843
that you are starting a golf
team at your high school.

580
00:25:01.707 --> 00:25:02.742
Yeah. that'’s right. yeah.

581
00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:06.435
Our first practice is tomorrow.

582
00:25:06.574 --> 00:25:08.610
And actually we can really use

583
00:25:08.748 --> 00:25:10.439
a knowledgeable assistant coach.

584
00:25:10.578 --> 00:25:11.613
What did I tell you?

585
00:25:11.751 --> 00:25:12.545
[Gayle] There it is.

586
00:25:12.683 --> 00:25:13.753
I rest my case.

587
00:25:13.891 --> 00:25:14.754
Think about it.

588
00:25:14.892 --> 00:25:16.445
All right?

589
00:25:22.762 --> 00:25:24.419
Cheers.

590
00:25:25.593 --> 00:25:27.284
So?

591
00:25:27.422 --> 00:25:28.734
What?

592
00:25:28.872 --> 00:25:30.563
Club'’s closed Mondays. right?

593
00:25:30.701 --> 00:25:32.876
God. do you ever stop?

594
00:25:33.014 --> 00:25:34.325
No one'’s there.

595
00:25:34.463 --> 00:25:36.880
The boys gotta play
on grass eventually.

596
00:25:37.018 --> 00:25:38.398
Let me ask you something.

597
00:25:38.537 --> 00:25:40.400
Are they any good?

598
00:25:41.229 --> 00:25:43.542
Well. they. you know
they. they can be.

599
00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.440
You don'’t even know.

600
00:25:45.578 --> 00:25:46.752
Why does it even matter?

601
00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:48.408
Well. well. of course
it matters.

602
00:25:48.547 --> 00:25:50.238
I don'’t want a bunch of
kids tearing up my course.

603
00:25:50.376 --> 00:25:52.551
No. the most important
thing is that people see

604
00:25:52.689 --> 00:25:54.276
Mexican kids golfing.

605
00:25:54.414 --> 00:25:56.347
All right. that'’s
good enough for now.

606
00:25:56.485 --> 00:25:57.763
Good for who?

607
00:25:57.901 --> 00:26:00.179
For the kids. for everybody.

608
00:26:00.317 --> 00:26:02.699
People need to see us as
more than just caddies

609
00:26:02.837 --> 00:26:05.425
and cannon fodder.

610
00:26:07.013 --> 00:26:09.015
Well. just think about it.

611
00:26:14.124 --> 00:26:20.199
[metal clinking]

612
00:26:26.205 --> 00:26:27.482
[Lucy] He looks thirsty.

613
00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:30.312
Yeah. I want him to
suffer a little bit.

614
00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:32.901
Maybe he'’ll
change his mind.

615
00:26:34.247 --> 00:26:35.870
- What?
- I'’m. I'’m kidding.

616
00:26:36.008 --> 00:26:37.630
Here.

617
00:26:37.768 --> 00:26:39.908
[JB sighs]

618
00:26:41.358 --> 00:26:44.464
So this is what it
might have felt like.

619
00:26:44.603 --> 00:26:45.983
What?

620
00:26:46.121 --> 00:26:48.399
For you to have
a son of your own.

621
00:26:50.781 --> 00:26:52.162
He even kinda looks like you.

622
00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:54.474
That'’s not what this is about.

623
00:26:54.613 --> 00:26:55.993
Mm-hmm.

624
00:26:58.858 --> 00:26:59.928
[door closes]

625
00:27:07.487 --> 00:27:17.359
[metal clanking]

626
00:27:17.497 --> 00:27:26.506
[metal clanking]

627
00:27:26.645 --> 00:27:27.956
All right.

628
00:27:28.094 --> 00:27:29.268
Think you made your point.

629
00:27:29.406 --> 00:27:31.235
I get it.

630
00:27:31.373 --> 00:27:33.375
Get what?

631
00:27:33.997 --> 00:27:35.343
Okay. maybe I don'’t get it.

632
00:27:35.481 --> 00:27:36.655
Why don'’t you want
to join the team?

633
00:27:36.793 --> 00:27:38.104
You obviously wanna play golf.

634
00:27:38.242 --> 00:27:39.588
[Joe] I play golf
every weekend.

635
00:27:39.727 --> 00:27:41.211
I mean on a real course.

636
00:27:41.349 --> 00:27:42.695
Where people can see you play.

637
00:27:42.833 --> 00:27:44.076
My friends see me play.

638
00:27:44.214 --> 00:27:45.974
I'’m talking about
important people.

639
00:27:47.182 --> 00:27:48.839
Well. they'’re important to me.

640
00:27:48.977 --> 00:27:50.427
Look. you know what I mean.

641
00:27:50.565 --> 00:27:52.394
All right. just some opinions
matter more than others.

642
00:27:52.532 --> 00:27:53.879
That'’s all I'’m saying.

643
00:27:54.017 --> 00:27:55.294
It'’s not fair. but that'’s life.

644
00:27:55.432 --> 00:27:57.365
The only opinion I
care about is mine.

645
00:27:58.469 --> 00:28:02.232
All right. well. tell me.
Joe. what do you want?

646
00:28:03.716 --> 00:28:04.924
Want?

647
00:28:05.062 --> 00:28:07.340
Yeah. five. ten. twenty
years from now.

648
00:28:07.478 --> 00:28:09.688
What do you want from life?

649
00:28:15.659 --> 00:28:17.385
You better figure it out.

650
00:28:17.834 --> 00:28:19.974
'’Cause life is.

651
00:28:20.112 --> 00:28:21.769
well. it'’s a lot like golf.

652
00:28:22.597 --> 00:28:26.187
Yeah. some days it'’s smooth
sailing on the fairway.

653
00:28:26.325 --> 00:28:27.740
Other days you'’re
lost in the woods.

654
00:28:27.878 --> 00:28:30.536
But as long as you can
keep your eye on that flag

655
00:28:30.674 --> 00:28:33.401
you can always hack your way
back onto smooth ground.

656
00:28:33.539 --> 00:28:35.990
But if you don'’t know what
you'’re aiming for. then...

657
00:28:38.786 --> 00:28:40.926
I don'’t know.

658
00:28:43.618 --> 00:28:46.448
[wind blowing]

659
00:28:46.586 --> 00:28:49.210
Okay then maybe I'’ll just say
a few words. set expectations.

660
00:28:49.348 --> 00:28:51.108
but jump in whenever you want.

661
00:28:51.246 --> 00:28:52.627
All right. and then when
it comes to technique

662
00:28:52.765 --> 00:28:54.042
you'’re the coach as
far as I'’m concerned.

663
00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:55.492
So I just defer to
whatever you want.

664
00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:57.528
JB. stop trying to
butter me up. all right?

665
00:28:57.666 --> 00:28:59.530
I know what you need.

666
00:28:59.668 --> 00:29:02.810
You need a white guy to
schmooze the officials

667
00:29:02.948 --> 00:29:04.397
and get you into tournaments.

668
00:29:04.535 --> 00:29:06.641
This is not a regular
thing. all right?

669
00:29:06.779 --> 00:29:07.676
I'’m not their coach.

670
00:29:07.815 --> 00:29:09.333
You are.

671
00:29:09.471 --> 00:29:11.266
Yeah. but Frank. come on.
you love teaching the game.

672
00:29:11.404 --> 00:29:14.338
Yeah. to people who want to
learn and respect the game.

673
00:29:14.476 --> 00:29:16.513
Yeah. but I don'’t want
to be a babysitter

674
00:29:16.651 --> 00:29:18.239
to a bunch of
juvenile delinquents

675
00:29:18.377 --> 00:29:20.966
who just want to get
outta detention.

676
00:29:22.864 --> 00:29:33.081
[gentle music]

677
00:29:33.219 --> 00:29:34.220
[Mario whistles]

678
00:29:34.358 --> 00:29:45.507
[gentle music]

679
00:29:45.645 --> 00:29:47.509
- Good morning. sir.
- Morning boys.

680
00:29:47.647 --> 00:29:49.235
Why don'’t you take a knee?

681
00:29:52.825 --> 00:29:55.724
Y'’all working on a
sand trap down there?

682
00:29:55.863 --> 00:29:57.519
Yes sir.

683
00:29:57.657 --> 00:30:00.281
It'’s a par three when we shoot
from here to the near flag

684
00:30:00.419 --> 00:30:02.110
and a par four when
we shoot to the flag

685
00:30:02.248 --> 00:30:03.491
at the bottom of the hill.

686
00:30:03.629 --> 00:30:06.149
We just play it 18 times
for a full round.

687
00:30:06.839 --> 00:30:08.634
All right. well you
boys probably recognize

688
00:30:08.772 --> 00:30:10.947
Mr. Mitchell here from
the country club. right?

689
00:30:11.085 --> 00:30:12.120
- Of course sir.
- Yes.

690
00:30:12.258 --> 00:30:13.708
Well. he'’s a great instructor

691
00:30:13.846 --> 00:30:16.193
and he'’s agreed just
this one time to come--

692
00:30:16.331 --> 00:30:18.126
And you.

693
00:30:18.264 --> 00:30:20.991
you boys built all this?

694
00:30:21.129 --> 00:30:23.235
Yes. Mr. Mitchell.

695
00:30:27.964 --> 00:30:29.413
Call me Coach.

696
00:30:33.728 --> 00:30:35.040
Get you an extra nickel

697
00:30:35.178 --> 00:30:37.180
if you get the grass stains
outta the white leather.

698
00:30:38.008 --> 00:30:40.148
Yes. sir.

699
00:30:41.736 --> 00:30:44.014
[brush scratching]

700
00:30:44.152 --> 00:30:45.982
Oye. ¿Qué onda?

701
00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.432
- Hey. Pollo.
- Hey.

702
00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:50.020
Where'’s your crew?

703
00:30:50.158 --> 00:30:51.850
Golf practice. I think.

704
00:30:51.988 --> 00:30:52.816
Golf practice?

705
00:30:52.954 --> 00:30:54.197
What golf practice?

706
00:30:54.335 --> 00:30:55.957
The high school
started a team.

707
00:30:56.095 --> 00:30:57.614
Oh yeah?

708
00:30:57.752 --> 00:30:59.685
And you weren'’t good enough.
and they left you behind?

709
00:30:59.823 --> 00:31:01.238
Chingao man.

710
00:31:01.376 --> 00:31:03.102
at least you know who
your real friends are now.

711
00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.932
Nah. I...

712
00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:06.209
they didn'’t leave me behind.

713
00:31:06.347 --> 00:31:07.727
I told them no.

714
00:31:09.039 --> 00:31:10.799
What. you don'’t want to play?

715
00:31:10.938 --> 00:31:12.387
I ain'’t gonna perform
in front of rich bastards

716
00:31:12.525 --> 00:31:14.148
who don'’t respect me.

717
00:31:14.286 --> 00:31:17.047
Oh. well you know what?

718
00:31:17.185 --> 00:31:19.394
I completely agree with you.

719
00:31:19.532 --> 00:31:20.533
I mean. why put
yourself out there

720
00:31:20.671 --> 00:31:22.052
where they can laugh at you.

721
00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:23.433
Right.

722
00:31:23.571 --> 00:31:25.193
That'’s why I never
take off my cage.

723
00:31:25.331 --> 00:31:27.161
It'’s my invisibility suit.

"Hey. I know my place.

725
00:31:29.611 --> 00:31:32.062
You don'’t gotta
worry about me. huh?"

726
00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.546
I mean. they'’ll
never respect you

727
00:31:33.684 --> 00:31:35.963
but at least they
can'’t hurt you.

728

And that'’s the important part.

That'’s how I ended up here.

Thanks. Pollo.

00:31:49.977 --> 00:31:51.495
[Mario] We cleared out the
smaller mesquite trees

735
00:31:51.633 --> 00:31:53.359
through there but the nopales
are kinda painful

736
00:31:53.497 --> 00:31:54.809
to remove without gloves.

737
00:31:54.947 --> 00:31:56.707
So we just treat
'’em like sand traps...

738
00:31:56.845 --> 00:31:59.296
Yeah. you really don'’t want
to hit into those nopales.

739
00:31:59.434 --> 00:32:01.747
And this is where
we put the most work.

740
00:32:02.127 --> 00:32:05.613
Clearing all the roots was
probably the hardest part.

741

Well. it'’s a lot of work.

What do you think. Coach?

743
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:11.895
Well. I think if you
can putt on these greens

744
00:32:12.033 --> 00:32:14.139

Why would I want
to hit a draw?

Cause if you'’re gonna
be in a tournament.

have all the shots.

you get less opportunity.

to be played.

1957
01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:02.536
in joining this club.
is that right?

1958
01:26:02.674 --> 01:26:03.951
I mean. Don. don'’t you
think you could make an

1959
01:26:04.089 --> 01:26:07.610
exception for a man of
Mister Peña'’s caliber?

1960
01:26:07.748 --> 01:26:09.785
Uh. yes. yes. I-I think so.

1961
01:26:09.923 --> 01:26:11.511
There you have it.
no one goes to jail.

1962
01:26:11.649 --> 01:26:12.891
No one loses their job.

1963
01:26:13.029 --> 01:26:14.238
and you become the
first Mexican member

1964
01:26:14.376 --> 01:26:16.205
of the Del Rio Country Club.

1965
01:26:16.343 --> 01:26:20.071
Sounds like a win for
everybody to me. [laughs]

1966
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:23.557
What do you say. JB?

1967
01:26:26.802 --> 01:26:29.874
You should choose your next
words carefully. Mister Peña.

1968
01:26:30.668 --> 01:26:32.152
Or I promise you.

1969
01:26:32.290 --> 01:26:35.466
you'’ll never step foot on a
Texas golf course again.

1970
01:26:39.228 --> 01:26:40.885
Good luck to you
and your boy. sir.

1971
01:26:41.023 --> 01:26:42.921
Man of character.
I respect that.

1972
01:26:45.959 --> 01:26:47.857
They'’re gonna need it.

1973
01:26:48.237 --> 01:26:50.032
You son of a...

1974
01:26:50.308 --> 01:26:51.723
- JB--
- No. Don.

1975
01:26:51.861 --> 01:26:53.656
that boy should still
be disqualified.

1976
01:26:53.794 --> 01:26:55.210
[Mr. Glenn] On what ground?

1977
01:26:55.348 --> 01:26:57.384
Well. I don'’t know.
dammit just do something!

1978
01:26:57.522 --> 01:27:09.224
[somber music]

1979
01:27:09.362 --> 01:27:11.847
[door clanking]

1980
01:27:15.437 --> 01:27:16.679
Hey.

1981
01:27:16.817 --> 01:27:17.749
How'’d you get me out?

1982
01:27:17.887 --> 01:27:19.648
No. Principal Guerra did.

1983
01:27:20.235 --> 01:27:21.995
Chief Reyes is
my dad'’s cousin.

1984
01:27:22.133 --> 01:27:25.757
No. hombre. your abuela
Vidalia was my mom'’s aunt.

1985
01:27:25.895 --> 01:27:28.450
Yes. I. yes. okay.
we'’re double related.

1986
01:27:28.588 --> 01:27:30.969
Your abuela was Vidalia Ortiz?

1987
01:27:31.107 --> 01:27:32.902
She was.

1988
01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:34.973
[chuckles] Vidalia was
my great aunt. man.

1989
01:27:35.111 --> 01:27:36.872
¿Marranito?

1990
01:27:37.010 --> 01:27:38.218
Look at you.

1991
01:27:38.356 --> 01:27:39.875
You lost weight!

1992
01:27:40.013 --> 01:27:41.877
I-I guess we'’re cousins too.

1993
01:27:42.015 --> 01:27:43.982
that'’s Del Rio for you.

1994
01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:45.121
- Yeah.
- Sí. sí.

1995
01:27:46.675 --> 01:27:54.130
[somber music]

1996
01:27:54.269 --> 01:27:56.236

[ball smacks JB]

2005
01:28:32.376 --> 01:28:33.480
Pollo. is that you?

2006
01:28:33.618 --> 01:28:35.689
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?

2007
01:28:35.827 --> 01:28:38.589
What are you doing
out here. cabrón?

2008
01:28:39.452 --> 01:28:42.558
What does it look like?

2009
01:28:42.696 --> 01:28:43.973
Celebratin'’!

2010
01:28:44.111 --> 01:28:45.492
Fifth place.

2011
01:28:45.630 --> 01:28:49.841
Oh. you come out here to
feel sorry for yourself. huh?

2012
01:28:50.255 --> 01:28:52.119
Why don'’t you take your
pity party somewhere else?

2013
01:28:52.257 --> 01:28:55.675
'’Cause your salty tears
are going to kill my grass.

2014
01:28:55.813 --> 01:28:56.676
Mm. okay.

2015
01:28:56.814 --> 01:28:58.022
You kids today. all act

2016
01:28:58.160 --> 01:28:59.817
like the world owes
you something.

2017
01:28:59.955 --> 01:29:01.266
I got news for you.

2018
01:29:01.405 --> 01:29:03.683
This country is not
your mama'’s pecho.

2019
01:29:03.821 --> 01:29:06.651
I-I-I'’m not looking for pity.

2020
01:29:06.789 --> 01:29:08.066
Hmm?

2021
01:29:08.204 --> 01:29:09.378
And I'’ll tell you
something else.

2022
01:29:09.516 --> 01:29:11.207
I serve my country.

2023
01:29:11.346 --> 01:29:12.830
Oh. that was you?

2024
01:29:12.968 --> 01:29:16.109
Yeah. yeah. just
like everybody else.

2025
01:29:17.490 --> 01:29:19.733
I guess the only difference is

2026
01:29:19.871 --> 01:29:22.564
when we came back there wasn'’t

2027
01:29:22.702 --> 01:29:23.875
parades or fireworks

2028
01:29:24.013 --> 01:29:25.981
or invitations to
the White House.

2029
01:29:26.119 --> 01:29:27.638
There'’s no thanks
for our service.

2030
01:29:27.776 --> 01:29:30.537
It'’s like we fought for
someone else'’s country.

2031
01:29:30.675 --> 01:29:32.677
You know. like. I don'’t know.

2032
01:29:32.815 --> 01:29:34.817
like we didn'’t count.

2033
01:29:34.955 --> 01:29:40.547
[deeply inhales]
Oh. ow. [grunts]

2034
01:29:40.685 --> 01:29:41.928
Pollo. are you all right?

2035
01:29:42.066 --> 01:29:43.032
My heart. that'’s such
a sad story.

2036
01:29:43.170 --> 01:29:45.345
[chuckles]

2037
01:29:45.483 --> 01:29:46.519
Forget it. come on.

2038
01:29:46.657 --> 01:29:47.451
Hey. you know what?

2039
01:29:47.589 --> 01:29:49.176
I served in the war too.

2040
01:29:49.314 --> 01:29:53.215
I fought. you know. the war to
end all wars. the Great War.

2041
01:29:53.353 --> 01:29:56.114
But you know what these
vatos never gave me?

2042
01:29:56.252 --> 01:29:57.668
A gas mask. huh.

2043
01:29:57.806 --> 01:30:00.878
You ever been in a trench with
mustard gas and no gas mask?

2044
01:30:01.016 --> 01:30:03.328
- No.
- No. I didn'’t think so.

2045
01:30:03.467 --> 01:30:04.847
But you want a parade. huh?

2046
01:30:04.985 --> 01:30:07.471
Yeah. we can have a
parade with balloons. huh?

2047
01:30:07.609 --> 01:30:08.886
Okay. you had
it worse than me.

2048
01:30:09.024 --> 01:30:10.128
Is that supposed to
make me feel better

2049
01:30:10.266 --> 01:30:11.613
or something like that?
- Well.

2050
01:30:11.751 --> 01:30:13.131
I guess nobody
ever told you. huh?

2051
01:30:13.269 --> 01:30:15.099
Life ain'’t fair.

2052
01:30:15.237 --> 01:30:17.895
I mean. I didn'’t
ask for this face.

2053
01:30:18.033 --> 01:30:19.344
Ah. come on.
it'’s not that bad.

2054
01:30:19.483 --> 01:30:20.829
But you know. I-I understand

2055
01:30:20.967 --> 01:30:23.348
if people are jealous
when they look at me.

2056
01:30:23.487 --> 01:30:25.765
[JB scoffs]

2057
01:30:27.214 --> 01:30:28.802
- Oh.
- My brother Chucho.

2058
01:30:28.940 --> 01:30:30.563
he can'’t even stand in
the same picture with me

2059
01:30:30.701 --> 01:30:32.323
'’cause I make him look bad.

2060
01:30:32.461 --> 01:30:33.600
Mm. right.

2061
01:30:33.738 --> 01:30:35.913
You know. that'’s just life.

2062
01:30:36.051 --> 01:30:37.915
Sometimes you land
on the green.

2063
01:30:38.053 --> 01:30:39.744
sometimes you'’re in the bunker.

2064
01:30:39.882 --> 01:30:44.024
but you always play it
as it lies.

2065
01:30:44.162 --> 01:30:46.510
But I tell you one thing.

2066
01:30:46.648 --> 01:30:49.858
Nobody can stop a man who
can get out of a bunker.

2067
01:30:51.860 --> 01:30:57.452
[birds chirping]

2068
01:31:03.665 --> 01:31:05.874
All right. everybody out.

[car door slams]

2070
01:31:10.465 --> 01:31:11.569
Come on.

2071
01:31:11.707 --> 01:31:12.812
[car door slams]

2072
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:14.434
All right. everybody
huddle up.

2073
01:31:14.572 --> 01:31:17.437
I got somebody here wants to
say a few words to you.

2074
01:31:17.575 --> 01:31:18.507
[birds chirping]

2075
01:31:18.645 --> 01:31:20.578
- Morning. fellas.
- Coach

2076
01:31:20.716 --> 01:31:22.546
Hey. Coach.

2077
01:31:22.684 --> 01:31:25.203
Just wanted to. uh.

2078
01:31:25.341 --> 01:31:26.791
wish you luck.

2079
01:31:26.929 --> 01:31:28.586
And. well.

2080
01:31:28.724 --> 01:31:29.518
also wanted to apologize.

2081
01:31:29.656 --> 01:31:30.933
Apologize for what?

2082
01:31:31.071 --> 01:31:32.314
Hey. this ain'’t
your fault. Coach.

2083
01:31:32.452 --> 01:31:33.729
No. I'’m not talking
about yesterday.

2084
01:31:33.867 --> 01:31:37.526
I'’m talking about
this whole year.

2085
01:31:38.562 --> 01:31:40.771
You guys ever heard
of Bobby Jones?

2086
01:31:40.909 --> 01:31:42.497
Probably the greatest
golfer of all time.

2087
01:31:42.635 --> 01:31:43.912
- Yeah.
- That'’s right.

2088
01:31:44.050 --> 01:31:45.016
Yeah. he used to say
that golf was played

2089
01:31:45.154 --> 01:31:47.432
on a five-inch course--

2090
01:31:47.571 --> 01:31:49.469
the space between your ears.

2091
01:31:49.607 --> 01:31:51.782
Right. this game is.

2092
01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:53.542
this game is mental.

2093
01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:56.096
Right. your real opponent

2094
01:31:56.234 --> 01:31:58.478
isn'’t out there on the course.

2095
01:31:58.616 --> 01:32:00.411
It'’s right here.

2096
01:32:01.067 --> 01:32:04.346
Now. if I'’m being honest.
when I started this team.

2097
01:32:04.484 --> 01:32:08.833
I just wanted to be a member
of that club right there.

2098
01:32:09.662 --> 01:32:12.492
I showed you boys the
rules of the game.

2099
01:32:12.630 --> 01:32:16.289
You know. how to smile.
how to act. how to dress.

2100
01:32:16.427 --> 01:32:20.017
showed you boys how to fit in
so they wouldn'’t laugh at you.

2101
01:32:21.743 --> 01:32:24.469
So...

2102
01:32:24.608 --> 01:32:26.126
they wouldn'’t laugh at me.

2103
01:32:29.026 --> 01:32:32.098
Yeah. all I wanted was
for them to accept us.

2104
01:32:32.926 --> 01:32:34.894
Today'’s different.

2105
01:32:35.032 --> 01:32:39.312
Today. you have the opportunity
to make '’em respect us.

2106
01:32:39.450 --> 01:32:42.487
Now. these teams. they'’re
the best in the state.

2107
01:32:42.626 --> 01:32:45.352
and they'’ve had access to a
lot of things you boys haven'’t.

2108
01:32:45.490 --> 01:32:47.769
Best courses.
top-of-the-line gear.

2109
01:32:47.907 --> 01:32:51.600
[scoffs] Probably
a better coach.

2110
01:32:52.739 --> 01:32:55.086
But the best golfer isn'’t the
one with the fanciest clubs

2111
01:32:55.224 --> 01:32:58.469
or the nicest shoes
or any of that stuff.

2112
01:32:58.607 --> 01:32:59.988
It'’s the one who
can summon the will

2113
01:33:00.126 --> 01:33:04.371
to keep swinging when
things get tough.

2114
01:33:04.509 --> 01:33:06.581
Until you-your
hands are bleeding.

2115
01:33:06.719 --> 01:33:09.066
you got sweat on your face
and sand in your eyes

2116
01:33:09.204 --> 01:33:11.896
but you keep moving
towards that flag.

2117
01:33:14.934 --> 01:33:17.730
And that'’s you boys.

2118
01:33:17.868 --> 01:33:19.455
every single one of you.

2119
01:33:20.664 --> 01:33:23.390
All right. you.

2120
01:33:23.528 --> 01:33:24.944
you belong here.

2121
01:33:28.223 --> 01:33:30.018
Don'’t let anybody
tell you otherwise.

2122
01:33:34.919 --> 01:33:36.334
Not even me.

2123
01:33:37.784 --> 01:33:39.372
Let'’s get '’em.
Mustangs on three.

2124
01:33:39.510 --> 01:33:41.098
okay. come on. okay.

2125
01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:44.032
One. two. three.

2126
01:33:44.170 --> 01:33:45.412
[All] Mustangs!
