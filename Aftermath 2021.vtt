by the image of someone's brains

172
00:10:49.523 --> 00:10:52.109
being splattered
all over the living room wall.

173
00:10:54.695 --> 00:10:57.740
Well. I don't want to sleep in a bed
where I have to relive my wife

174
00:10:57.823 --> 00:10:59.408
sucking another guy's dick.

175
00:11:04.872 --> 00:11:06.916
You stopped helping yourself.

176
00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:08.709
You dropped out of college.

177
00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:11.712
You wouldn't talk to me.
Let alone go anywhere near me.

178
00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:17.093
I had a moment of weakness.
and I hate myself for that.

179
00:11:18.886 --> 00:11:20.971
But you cannot keep punishing me.

180
00:11:21.597 --> 00:11:22.598
[sighs]

181
00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:27.937
-[Kevin] I know.
-[sighs]

182
00:11:30.773 --> 00:11:32.775
I'm going to sleep on the couch. okay?

183
00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:49.333
Hey.

184
00:11:49.583 --> 00:11:50.668
Hey.

185
00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:55.840
It… it has to have a home office.

186
00:11:57.383 --> 00:11:58.467
[chuckles]

187
00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:00.428
Okay.

188
00:12:01.512 --> 00:12:05.975
And we're really gonna
have to cut back on our expenses.

189
00:12:06.058 --> 00:12:08.227
At least until this deal goes through.

190
00:12:09.019 --> 00:12:10.354
I can do that.

191
00:12:12.481 --> 00:12:14.400
And you have to go back to college.

192
00:12:16.527 --> 00:12:19.321
Kevin. I can't watch you
throw your life away anymore.

193
00:12:24.326 --> 00:12:25.411
Okay.

194
00:12:27.329 --> 00:12:28.497
Promise me.

195
00:12:31.542 --> 00:12:32.751
I promise.

196
00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:36.297
Okay.

197
00:12:49.226 --> 00:12:50.227
Wow.

198
00:12:53.814 --> 00:12:56.025
[Kevin] Thanks again
for walking through with us.

199
00:12:56.108 --> 00:12:57.860
We know this is not easy for you.

200
00:12:57.943 --> 00:12:58.819
[Claudia] Of course.

201
00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:00.237
Hey what is that. right there?

202
00:13:01.071 --> 00:13:02.948
[Claudia] Oh. remote locks.

203
00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:06.035
There's an app
that you can link your phones to.

204
00:13:06.118 --> 00:13:07.912
Wow! I didn't even know that was a thing.

205
00:13:07.995 --> 00:13:10.581
Yeah. you're going to find
a lot of that stuff here.

206
00:13:10.664 --> 00:13:14.376
Um. there were some technical difficulties
here and there with the cameras.

207
00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.296
I… I guess you would
have to call the company to set it up.

208
00:13:18.172 --> 00:13:19.590
As you guys already know.

209
00:13:19.673 --> 00:13:21.926
my brother and his wife
designed everything here.

210
00:13:22.009 --> 00:13:25.429
so you're gonna get
a lot of expensive extras at a low cost.

211
00:13:26.096 --> 00:13:29.266
-Um. guys. wait till you see outside.
-[Kevin] Yeah.

212
00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:33.812
Whoa! I mean it pretty much
speaks for itself.

213
00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:35.606
Wow.

214
00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:40.653
I know that this is not
an ideal situation for anyone.

215
00:13:40.736 --> 00:13:45.115
but this back yard
and the closet space. right?

216
00:13:46.575 --> 00:13:49.578
Look. Claudia.
we're obviously very interested.

217
00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:52.456
but I'll be honest with you.
It's been a rough couple of years.

218
00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.208
I know it's not what you offered.

219
00:13:55.334 --> 00:13:57.086
But it's what we can afford.

220
00:13:57.628 --> 00:14:01.465
If you can say yes to that number.
we can sign the paperwork today.

221
00:14:05.469 --> 00:14:07.012
We really need a fresh start.

222
00:14:08.013 --> 00:14:10.140
[Robert whispering]
Please. let's talk about this.

223
00:14:12.935 --> 00:14:14.103
[Claudia] The truth is.

224
00:14:14.186 --> 00:14:16.397
we haven't had a prospective buyer
in months.

225
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:20.651
I don't know. I guess
people scare off easily these days.

226
00:14:22.736 --> 00:14:24.363
Add another 20k and it's yours.

227
00:14:24.446 --> 00:14:25.865
-Yes! Yes!
-[laughs]

228
00:14:25.948 --> 00:14:28.868
Oh. my God. you have no idea
how much this means to us.

229
00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:31.036
We're just as happy
to have it off our hands.

230
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.539
And I know that you guys
will be really happy here.

231
00:14:34.957 --> 00:14:36.417
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

232
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.252
Thank you so much.

233
00:14:38.335 --> 00:14:39.169
Thanks. man.

234
00:14:40.963 --> 00:14:43.507
-Enjoy the house.
-[Claudia] Oh. Robert.

235
00:14:45.634 --> 00:14:48.679
-Oh. my God.
-Yes. we just bought a house.

236
00:14:55.936 --> 00:14:57.813
[dog barking]

237
00:14:57.897 --> 00:14:59.899
[Natalie chuckles] Well. Odi loves it.

238
00:15:01.984 --> 00:15:04.236
So? It's beautiful. right?

239
00:15:04.528 --> 00:15:06.238
It's something.

240
00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:08.365
So that's where he killed her?

241
00:15:09.283 --> 00:15:11.619
Ugh! So creepy.

242
00:15:12.536 --> 00:15:13.704
Thank you.

243
00:15:14.246 --> 00:15:16.540
Please. I am just
pointing out the obvious.

244
00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:19.710
[Dani] Nice plot of land.

245
00:15:19.793 --> 00:15:21.712
Perfect for burying murder victims.

246
00:15:28.385 --> 00:15:31.764
Are you. uh. sure this is a good decision?

247
00:15:33.223 --> 00:15:35.851
Just seems like a lot
to go through to get laid. that's all.

248
00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:38.145
[scoffs] Okay. well.
in case you didn't notice

249
00:15:38.228 --> 00:15:41.732
the moving boxes you helped carry in.
it's a little late for that.

250
00:15:41.815 --> 00:15:45.152
As mom or Gandhi would say.
"It's never too late."

251
00:15:45.235 --> 00:15:48.280
Uh. Gandhi never said that.
and mom is an idiot.

252
00:15:49.323 --> 00:15:52.159
You know. that is very harsh.
on both parties.

253
00:15:52.242 --> 00:15:53.744
[Odi barking]

254
00:15:53.827 --> 00:15:55.120
Dead body!

255
00:15:55.204 --> 00:15:57.206
-[Odi barking]
-I called it!

[barking]

257
00:16:08.926 --> 00:16:10.803
Oh. that is all you.

258
00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:42.918
Oh. Jesus.

259
00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.797
-Is that where he pulled her out from?
-Dani. stop!

260
00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:49.216
[barking]

261
00:16:49.508 --> 00:16:51.427
You know. it's her own fault.
hiding in a closet

262
00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:52.928
instead of using the front door.

263
00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:54.430
-[Odi barking]
-[sighs]

264
00:16:54.805 --> 00:16:55.973
What?

265
00:16:56.056 --> 00:16:58.350
All right. come on. you little freak.

266
00:17:06.775 --> 00:17:07.818
-[Kevin grunts]
-[gasps]

267
00:17:07.901 --> 00:17:10.654
Oh! Oh. my God!
I'm so sorry. baby! Are you okay?

268
00:17:10.738 --> 00:17:12.031
I don't know. Is it bleeding?

269
00:17:12.114 --> 00:17:14.700
-No. What the hell were you doing?
-[groans]

270
00:17:14.783 --> 00:17:17.119
-I was joking!
-It's not funny!

271

[both sigh]

273
00:17:27.379 --> 00:17:28.547
It's your turn.

274
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.966
Mmm-mmm.
I can't hear you. I'm fast asleep.

275
00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:35.095
-[groaning] No.
-No. No. No. I don't want to.

276
00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:37.473
Okay. okay. okay.

277
00:17:41.018 --> 00:17:42.519
[sighs] Come on. Odi.

278
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:44.563
Let's go. Come on. Come on.

279
00:17:46.857 --> 00:17:48.692

-Come on. Odi. Inside.

-[door closes]
-[Odi whimpers]

282
00:17:58.494 --> 00:18:00.162
There's nothing left to pee on.

[Odi whimpers. whines]

284
00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.416
Odi. come on. Let's go.

[whines]

286
00:18:07.711 --> 00:18:09.505
Odi. come on. You're killing me.

288
00:18:14.051 --> 00:18:15.469
Hey. shh!

289
00:18:16.178 --> 00:18:17.846
All right. fine. Stay. I'm going to bed.

[Kevin sighs. groans]

293
00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:35.948
Jesus. What?
Why are you looking at me like that?

294
00:18:37.533 --> 00:18:38.992
Did you just use the bathroom?

295
00:18:39.076 --> 00:18:41.787
No. but Odi did.
He took his sweet-ass time. too.

296
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:43.705
Kevin. someone is in the bathroom.

297
00:18:43.914 --> 00:18:44.915
What?

298
00:18:44.998 --> 00:18:46.875
Someone came in here
and went to the bathroom.

299
00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:48.418
I thought it was you.

300
00:18:58.303 --> 00:18:59.930

00:19:35.966 --> 00:19:36.967
[whispers] Kevin?

303
00:19:44.808 --> 00:19:46.518
No. There's nobody in here.

304
00:19:47.978 --> 00:19:48.937
[sighs in relief]

305
00:19:49.897 --> 00:19:51.523
That's not possible.

306
00:19:51.607 --> 00:19:54.109
He'd have to be pretty skinny
for me to miss him.

307
00:19:57.321 --> 00:19:58.989
-[sighs]
-Hmm.

308
00:20:02.034 --> 00:20:03.493
[sighs wearily]

309
00:20:07.331 --> 00:20:08.999
You have to sleep.

310
00:20:09.082 --> 00:20:11.835
It's our first night here.
Don't spook yourself out.

311
00:20:11.919 --> 00:20:13.295
Let's go to bed.

312
00:20:13.378 --> 00:20:15.756
-Fine.
-Thank you.

[murmuring]

315
00:20:33.482 --> 00:20:34.483
What the fuck?

316
00:20:36.443 --> 00:20:39.446
[Kevin] I'm not mad about it.
I just didn't pay for it.

317
00:20:39.529 --> 00:20:40.948
So. if it's free. I'll keep it.

318
00:20:41.031 --> 00:20:42.658
What do you mean you can't refund it?

319
00:20:42.741 --> 00:20:44.952
-I didn't order it.
-Have you seen my keys anywhere?

320
00:20:45.035 --> 00:20:47.955
Yeah. it's my name and my address.
but I personally didn't order it.

321
00:20:48.038 --> 00:20:50.749
-Kevin. Kevin. keys.
-I have to call you back.

322
00:20:50.832 --> 00:20:53.543
Hey. where was the last place you had 'em?

323
00:20:53.627 --> 00:20:56.630
My desk. but I've searched
the entire office. and they're not there.

324
00:20:56.713 --> 00:20:59.132
Right. So that's probably not
the last place you had them.

325
00:20:59.216 --> 00:21:01.260
Hmm. You know what?
I never really thought of that.

326
00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:04.304
It's amazing how some people could really
put it into perspective for you.

327
00:21:04.388 --> 00:21:05.931
-Hey.
-[sighs]

328
00:21:07.391 --> 00:21:08.350
Mmm.

329
00:21:08.433 --> 00:21:12.562
I'm sorry. I'm just… I'm late. and
I slept like shit and I look like shit.

330
00:21:12.646 --> 00:21:14.064
Babe. you look beautiful.

331
00:21:14.815 --> 00:21:16.608
And you are gonna do great today.

332
00:21:20.487 --> 00:21:23.824
Okay. that. truly not what it looks like.

333
00:21:23.907 --> 00:21:25.450
Don't to be ashamed.
It's a magazine.

334
00:21:25.534 --> 00:21:27.327
It's weird. 'cause you have the Internet.

335
00:21:27.411 --> 00:21:28.870
-Can we look for your keys?
-Yes.

336
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:32.874
[Natalie] Look. I told you.
I already excavated the entire place.

337
00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:34.042
It's not there.

338
00:21:34.126 --> 00:21:35.168
[keys jingling]

339
00:21:36.962 --> 00:21:39.631
I swear to God I checked there.

340
00:21:39.715 --> 00:21:42.926
Well. maybe God's just having an off day
and he's trying to fuck with you.

341
00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:45.429
-Don't you have some porn to go look at?
-I love you.

342
00:21:45.512 --> 00:21:46.805
I love you. too.

343
00:21:46.888 --> 00:21:50.100
Oh. um. I know you have a crazy day
between work and class.

344
00:21:50.183 --> 00:21:52.561
so I packed your lunch.
It's in the fridge. Blue lid.

345
00:21:53.437 --> 00:21:55.731

00:22:15.208 --> 00:22:17.336
-Thank you.
-Especially when it comes to wardrobe.

351

The amount of gifts
that I've had to return

357
00:22:41.651 --> 00:22:45.572
we'd like to establish you
as a brand name.

358
00:22:46.656 --> 00:22:47.699
Is that an offer?

359
00:22:47.783 --> 00:22:52.579
We can have you in anywhere
between 150 and 250 stores

360
00:22:52.662 --> 00:22:53.872
by the end of the season.

361
00:22:53.955 --> 00:22:55.165
Is this the part where I leave

362
00:22:55.248 --> 00:22:57.709
and pretend to think about it.
or can I just accept now?

363
00:22:57.793 --> 00:22:59.836
-No. you can wait.
-No. I would love to.

364
00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.254

-Thank you.

365
00:23:01.338 --> 00:23:03.090
-Can I hug you?
-Of course.

366
00:23:03.173 --> 00:23:04.925
Thank you so much!

367
00:23:05.008 --> 00:23:06.551
I'm going out of town next week.

368
00:23:06.635 --> 00:23:09.179

the preliminary process.

369
00:23:09.262 --> 00:23:10.388
[Natalie] Okay.

370
00:23:21.483 --> 00:23:26.446
I want you to modernize the structure
using the original foundation.

371
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:27.864
Guess what? You get to pair up.

372
00:23:27.948 --> 00:23:30.075
Yes. So. look around. Find a partner.

373
00:23:30.158 --> 00:23:32.494
Someone that's probably smarter than you.

374
00:23:32.577 --> 00:23:34.204
You might actually learn something.

375
00:23:35.497 --> 00:23:39.459
Take this seriously.
This is half of your grade.

376
00:23:39.543 --> 00:23:41.962
Don't procrastinate.
Check in with each other.

[Avery] Yes. me.
I'm stalking you. didn't you know?

381
00:23:55.433 --> 00:23:56.685
[Kevin] Yeah. I kinda figured.

382
00:23:56.768 --> 00:24:00.897
-So. Kevin?
-So. Avery?

383
00:24:03.567 --> 00:24:05.694
Oh. that's a little presumptuous.

384
00:24:06.486 --> 00:24:10.240
Okay. well. we're partners now.
so I have to be able to reach you.

385

-Thank you for making it super weird.
-[chuckles] There you go.

386
00:24:15.704 --> 00:24:19.082
All right. Kevin. I'll see you in class.

387
00:24:19.166 --> 00:24:21.793
Don't worry. because this is going to be

388
00:24:21.877 --> 00:24:25.672
the single fucking greatest
class project of all time.

Odi's vomit again. I swear--

I'm going to hang with Odi.
At least he appreciates me.

402
00:25:04.127 --> 00:25:06.046
-No. no. no. I appreciate you.
-Yeah. right.

403
00:25:06.129 --> 00:25:07.380
I do.

404
00:25:07.464 --> 00:25:09.216
-Thank you.
-You're welcome. Come here.

405
00:25:09.299 --> 00:25:12.052
I just figured that if they offered you
a deal. we could celebrate.

406
00:25:12.135 --> 00:25:14.930
and if it's wrong and they didn't.
then we can just get drunk.

00:34:12.925 --> 00:34:15.595
-Yeah. Nope. Pass.
-[Dani] Please.

514
00:34:15.678 --> 00:34:18.973
Dani. I don't have time right now.
I have to get ready for a meeting.

515
00:34:19.057 --> 00:34:21.768
Oh. come on. After everything
I helped you with last year?

516
00:34:21.851 --> 00:34:24.771
-Really? You're gonna guilt trip me now?
-[Odi barking]

517
00:34:24.854 --> 00:34:26.481
Only because mom is guilt tripping me.

518
00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:28.649
Besides. I already told her
you're hosting dinner.

519
00:34:28.733 --> 00:34:29.901
-What?
-[Odi whining]

520
00:34:29.984 --> 00:34:31.819
Dani. the last time
that mom came into town.

521
00:34:31.903 --> 00:34:33.196
we had to check you into rehab.

522
00:34:33.279 --> 00:34:35.656
If you want to have a relationship
with her. do your thing.

523
00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:38.451
Okay? But I decided a long time ago.
I don't wanna deal with it.

524
00:34:38.534 --> 00:34:40.078
I never ask you for anything.

525
00:34:40.161 --> 00:34:43.247
That is definitely not true. Odi.
I have been playing with you all morning.

526
00:34:43.331 --> 00:34:45.500
She's probably gonna go MIA
again after this anyway.

527
00:34:45.583 --> 00:34:48.878
What is so bad about a slightly
painful dinner every few years?

528
00:34:48.961 --> 00:34:50.046
Fine.

529
00:34:50.505 --> 00:34:52.215
-[sighs]
-[Odi barking]

530
00:34:52.882 --> 00:34:54.467
You can bring her here. okay?

531
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:56.469
But that is as much effort
as I'm putting in.

532
00:34:56.552 --> 00:34:57.804
-Okay.
-[Odi barking]

533
00:34:57.887 --> 00:35:00.306
Okay. look. I have to get ready
for this meeting. okay?

534
00:35:00.389 --> 00:35:01.390
Goodbye.

535
00:35:02.725 --> 00:35:03.935
[sighs wearily]

536
00:35:04.018 --> 00:35:06.729
-Did you get it stuck?
-[Odi whimpering]

537
00:35:08.189 --> 00:35:10.108
Oh. yeah. right in the middle.

538
00:35:10.399 --> 00:35:11.400
[straining]

539
00:35:13.486 --> 00:35:17.240
[sighs in exasperation] Okay.

-[eerie music playing]

541
00:36:01.826 --> 00:36:02.827
[sighs]

542
00:36:19.844 --> 00:36:22.430
[exhales] Hi. I'm checking in
under Dadich.

543
00:36:22.513 --> 00:36:24.765
Perfect. The other member
of your party just arrived.

544
00:36:24.849 --> 00:36:26.726
Oh. great. Thank you.

545
00:36:30.646 --> 00:36:32.690
-Hey. stranger.
-Nick.

546
00:36:33.733 --> 00:36:34.817
it's good to see you.

547
00:36:36.068 --> 00:36:37.195
Yeah. you. too.

548
00:36:38.112 --> 00:36:39.697
If you wanna just follow me this way.

549
00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:40.823
Uh. yes. Sorry.

550
00:36:40.907 --> 00:36:43.826
I don't mean to be rude.
but actually have a business meeting. so--

551
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:45.578
Yeah. I know.

552
00:36:48.456 --> 00:36:49.790
Natalie. wait. Just hear me out.

553
00:36:49.874 --> 00:36:51.542
You know I can't be seeing you right now.

554
00:36:51.626 --> 00:36:54.337
-If Kevin finds out about this--
-It's on me. Okay?

555
00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:56.964
You just tell him that you had no idea
and that's the truth.

556
00:36:57.048 --> 00:36:58.382
Why didn't you tell me?

557
00:36:59.675 --> 00:37:01.344
Because I knew you wouldn't come.

558
00:37:02.511 --> 00:37:05.473
A heads up would've been nice
before I signed the paperwork.

559
00:37:05.556 --> 00:37:08.100
I know. You have every right to be mad.
I get it.

560
00:37:08.184 --> 00:37:11.020
But you're talented. Natalie.

561
00:37:11.103 --> 00:37:13.105
And I'm not letting you
throw away an opportunity

562
00:37:13.189 --> 00:37:16.067
over whatever happened between us.
It's stupid.

563
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:20.238
Anne really likes you. okay?
All I did was provide the info. That's it.

564
00:37:22.448 --> 00:37:25.660
Will you come inside?
Take the meeting? Please?

565
00:37:28.996 --> 00:37:30.164
Fine.

566
00:37:31.582 --> 00:37:34.585
Fuck it. I'm going in for another shot.
You want one?

567
00:37:34.669 --> 00:37:35.753
No. I'm good.

568
00:37:35.836 --> 00:37:38.047
You sure? It's a 100% agave.

569
00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:39.423
Yeah. I gotta drive.

570
00:37:39.507 --> 00:37:44.553
Dude. you do realize we have. like.
two solid hours of work ahead of us?

571
00:37:44.637 --> 00:37:47.598
All right. Yeah. I guess
I have to then. [chuckles]

572
00:37:49.725 --> 00:37:50.559
Huh.

573
00:37:50.643 --> 00:37:52.436
What is that? West Elm?

574
00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:55.189
Uh. close. It's a hand-me-down
from my brother.

575
00:38:00.778 --> 00:38:02.029
[both] Cheers.

576
00:38:06.325 --> 00:38:07.952
[both groan]

577
00:38:09.996 --> 00:38:12.623
So. what about you?
Do you have any siblings. or…

578
00:38:13.207 --> 00:38:15.584
Um… yeah. a brother.

579
00:38:16.252 --> 00:38:17.503
Be honest. Is he…

580
00:38:18.379 --> 00:38:19.797
the good looking one?

581
00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:23.050
He was. actually.

582
00:38:23.926 --> 00:38:25.845
What? And then he got fat?

583
00:38:31.475 --> 00:38:32.768
No. he died.

584
00:38:34.353 --> 00:38:36.147
Oh. my God. dude.

585
00:38:37.273 --> 00:38:38.983
Fuck. I am so sorry.

586
00:38:39.859 --> 00:38:41.485
I am just so insensitive.

587
00:38:41.569 --> 00:38:43.112
-I'm sorry.
-No. you're okay.

588
00:38:43.946 --> 00:38:48.159
If you ever needed someone
to talk to or anything…

589
00:38:57.543 --> 00:38:58.878

So. 30 feet from the load-bearing beam
is the first floor egress.

595
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:21.752
Is this getting too cerebral for you?

596
00:40:22.503 --> 00:40:23.796
No. uh…

597
00:40:24.422 --> 00:40:27.091
-I think it's just a sinus issue.
-You want some nasal spray?

598
00:40:27.716 --> 00:40:30.428
Um. I'm gonna pass on the used
nasal spray. Thank you. though.

599
00:40:30.511 --> 00:40:32.763
Hey. hey. hey. It's organic.

600
00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:35.724
-Clever upsell. but I think I'll live.
-[chuckles]

601
00:40:36.225 --> 00:40:37.810
I should get home anyway.

602
00:40:38.269 --> 00:40:39.645
All right. I'll walk you out.

603
00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:58.873
Wake up.

[gasps. exhales]

605
00:41:01.208 --> 00:41:03.711
Easy. It's just me.

606
00:41:04.962 --> 00:41:06.714
What are you doing sleeping on the couch?

607
00:41:09.091 --> 00:41:10.176
Uh…

608
00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:13.095
I don't… I don't know.

609
00:41:13.637 --> 00:41:14.638
Come on.

610
00:41:16.891 --> 00:41:17.892
What's wrong?

611
00:41:20.561 --> 00:41:22.271
Kevin. someone was in here.

612
00:41:23.272 --> 00:41:25.816
No. no. I know what you're gonna say.
It was another nightmare.

613
00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.819
But it was so vivid. Kevin. I felt it.

614
00:41:29.028 --> 00:41:31.489
Look. the door was locked.
You were passed out down there.

615
00:41:31.572 --> 00:41:33.491
-probably working--
-You're not listening!

616
00:41:33.616 --> 00:41:35.326
It was real. Kevin!

617
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:37.244
You're calling me a liar.

618
00:41:37.328 --> 00:41:39.580
No. That's what you're choosing to hear.

619
00:41:39.663 --> 00:41:41.999
All right. let's just talk feelings.

620
00:41:42.082 --> 00:41:43.250

[Dr. Sasner] Kevin.

622
00:41:45.669 --> 00:41:46.962
Yeah. I can tell she is pissed.

623
00:41:47.046 --> 00:41:48.923
No. How are you feeling?

624
00:41:49.006 --> 00:41:51.884
Frustrated? I don't know.

625
00:41:52.009 --> 00:41:55.513
Look. my point is. is that we've both been
going through some difficult changes.

626
00:41:55.596 --> 00:41:57.223
We have this dinner with her mother

627
00:41:57.306 --> 00:41:59.308
that neither one of us are
looking forward to.

628
00:41:59.391 --> 00:42:02.686
Maybe all the stress is
an accumulation of these things.

629
00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:04.647
How does that explain what I saw?

630
00:42:07.566 --> 00:42:09.151
Paranoid hallucinations.

We'll not gonna act like this
with each other.

634
00:42:25.167 --> 00:42:27.461
I never thought
you would take a side opposite me.

635

I'm not!

636
00:42:29.171 --> 00:42:33.008
I'm just trying to think of
every rational explanation. Nat.

637
00:42:33.592 --> 00:42:35.344
I hate seeing you like this.

638
00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:39.557
If I could take this all away and
make it my own. you know I would.

639
00:42:55.197 --> 00:42:57.074
Let's go have a shitty meal with your mom.

640
00:42:57.908 --> 00:42:59.076

She's not the most organized.

690
00:50:02.416 --> 00:50:05.252
I know. but I told her she needed
to be here to feed Odi.

691
00:50:05.335 --> 00:50:06.795
Okay. so we'll feed him now.

692
00:50:06.878 --> 00:50:09.715
Kevin. he's been home alone all day!

693
00:50:09.798 --> 00:50:11.591
Look. I'm sure he's down here somewhere.

694
00:50:11.675 --> 00:50:12.759
[Natalie groans] Odi?

695
00:50:12.843 --> 00:50:14.136
[Kevin] Odi. come on. bud!

696
00:50:14.678 --> 00:50:16.596
-Odi.
-[Kevin clicks tongue]

697
00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.140
-[Odi whimpers]
-Ugh.

698
00:50:18.223 --> 00:50:21.268
Hi. baby. You okay?

699
00:50:22.728 --> 00:50:23.729
[Kevin exhales]

700
00:50:23.812 --> 00:50:25.564
You know. I knew she was going to do this.

701
00:50:25.647 --> 00:50:27.315
This is why I don't want to be involved.

702
00:50:27.399 --> 00:50:29.276
She tries to plan
these things with my mom.

703
00:50:29.359 --> 00:50:32.070
and then they get into it.
and I have to clean up the mess.

704
00:50:32.154 --> 00:50:34.781
And it's such bullshit! I just…
I just want her to show up

705
00:50:34.865 --> 00:50:36.283
when she says she's gonna show up.

706
00:50:36.366 --> 00:50:37.826
Don't worry about Dani.

707
00:50:37.909 --> 00:50:41.621
She'll show up. And if she doesn't.
just deal with her when she does.

708
00:50:42.247 --> 00:50:44.374
-Look. Odi is okay.
-Mmm-hmm.

709
00:50:44.458 --> 00:50:47.961
I'm gonna handle dinner.
I just want you to relax. Okay?

710
00:50:49.087 --> 00:50:53.675
Hmm! It is such a trip how America
westernizes these international cuisines.

711
00:50:53.967 --> 00:50:59.514
When I was in China. there was none of
this sweet and sour and General Tso crap.

712
00:50:59.598 --> 00:51:03.185
[Kevin] Yeah. Sorry to drop the takeout
on you. Farrah. Just short on time.

713
00:51:03.268 --> 00:51:05.312
No. no. no!
Thank you. Kevin. It's wonderful.

714
00:51:07.355 --> 00:51:09.024
Interesting. Mmm.

715
00:51:10.567 --> 00:51:15.280
So. I. uh. take it you're
still working on that documentary then?

716
00:51:16.406 --> 00:51:18.241
If you're talking about my life's work.

717
00:51:18.325 --> 00:51:20.368
yes. I'm still working
on that documentary.

718
00:51:20.952 --> 00:51:21.870
"Life's work?"

719
00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:24.498
How's that going. anyway?

720
00:51:24.581 --> 00:51:26.208
-Ah. it's going wonderfully.
-Hmm.

721
00:51:26.291 --> 00:51:27.959
-Joaquin and I--
-Who's Joaquin?

722
00:51:28.043 --> 00:51:29.085
He's my lover.

723
00:51:30.837 --> 00:51:33.256
Right. Is there any more
Szechuan chicken?

724
00:51:35.008 --> 00:51:36.092
Natalie…

725
00:51:36.551 --> 00:51:38.261
If there's something on your mind.

726
00:51:38.345 --> 00:51:40.847
I am opening the door for you
to share it with me.

727
00:51:42.098 --> 00:51:43.183
No. thanks.

728
00:51:43.642 --> 00:51:46.311
I'm allowed to enjoy my life. Natalie.

729
00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:48.522
You know. when I was your age.

730
00:51:48.605 --> 00:51:51.483
I was raising two daughters
and running a home business.

731
00:51:51.566 --> 00:51:54.277
And who funded that business. Mom?
Oh. right. it was dad.

732
00:51:54.361 --> 00:51:56.530
Drinks. Beer? Wine? I'll be right--

733
00:51:56.613 --> 00:51:58.490
Why is it so hard for you to support me?

734
00:51:58.573 --> 00:52:01.409
Well. it's hard to support something
that I've never seen!

735
00:52:02.285 --> 00:52:05.497
You know. I don't have to subject
myself to this kind of harassment.

736
00:52:05.747 --> 00:52:08.291
-Harassment?
-Yes! Harassment!

737
00:52:08.375 --> 00:52:10.544
You're a bully. Natalie.

738
00:52:10.627 --> 00:52:13.964
In fact. it wouldn't surprise me if that's
why your sister decided not to show up!

739
00:52:14.047 --> 00:52:15.632
Uh. I think we all know that's--

740
00:52:15.715 --> 00:52:18.510
No. no. no. no! No. Kevin.
It's fine. I'd like to leave now.

741
00:52:18.593 --> 00:52:20.762
Yeah! Kevin. she'd like to leave now.

742
00:52:20.846 --> 00:52:22.347
Tell Joaquin I said hi.

743
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:24.266
You know what. sweetheart?

744
00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:27.352
This brooding teen act
is a little outdated.

745
00:52:27.435 --> 00:52:30.730
Well. so is the whole
free-spirited charade.

746
00:52:30.814 --> 00:52:34.526
You should probably think about taking
"I raised two daughters" off your resume.

747
00:52:34.609 --> 00:52:36.486
because you quit that job a long time ago.

748
00:52:36.570 --> 00:52:39.489
That is so unfair! I sacrificed
everything for you and Dani!

749
00:52:39.573 --> 00:52:44.286
Oh. nothing but "I. I. I. I!"
You are such a fucking narcissist!

750
00:52:44.369 --> 00:52:45.996
-I am not!
-You only care about things

751
00:52:46.079 --> 00:52:49.040
that affect you! Honestly. Dani is
probably at her house right now.

752
00:52:49.124 --> 00:52:51.960
relapsing. Shooting up just like she did
the last time you came!

753
00:52:52.043 --> 00:52:53.044
Why would you say that?

754
00:52:53.128 --> 00:52:56.089
All because you rip through our lives
like a goddamn cancerous tornado!

755
00:52:56.172 --> 00:52:58.675
-[glass shattering]
-[tense music plays]

756
00:53:02.929 --> 00:53:04.723
[man 1] Come on! We gotta go! We gotta go!

757
00:53:04.806 --> 00:53:06.433
[man 2] You're not welcome here!

758
00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:08.602
[Kevin] What the fuck!

759
00:53:15.734 --> 00:53:18.695
[Richardson] Jon Santos. 19.
Katrina Kanter. 16.

760
00:53:18.778 --> 00:53:22.032
Trey Mahana. 17.
Any or all of 'em look familiar to you?

761
00:53:23.283 --> 00:53:26.036
No. I've never seen
any of these people in my life.

762
00:53:27.746 --> 00:53:28.830
[Richardson clears throat]

763
00:53:28.914 --> 00:53:30.123
[Kevin] "Unite the White?"

764
00:53:30.999 --> 00:53:32.208
I don't get it. What is that?

765
00:53:32.292 --> 00:53:35.545
One of the kids copied and pasted
this poster onto their Facebook page.

766
00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:40.508
The original source
had your address listed on it.

767
00:53:40.926 --> 00:53:43.345
It calls to recruit
white supremacist members.

768
00:53:46.556 --> 00:53:47.933
You think we did?

769
00:53:48.016 --> 00:53:49.434
I don't know what to think yet.

770
00:53:49.517 --> 00:53:52.520
But I do know it's a crazy time.
and anything goes.

771
00:53:52.604 --> 00:53:55.899
How dumb would you have to be
to put your home address on it?

772
00:53:55.982 --> 00:53:58.568
As dumb as you'd have to be
to post it in the first place.

773
00:54:00.946 --> 00:54:04.449
Okay. Officer Richardson.
I think what Kevin is trying to say is…

774
00:54:05.033 --> 00:54:07.160
that we would never contribute
to something like this…

775
00:54:09.162 --> 00:54:10.163
ever.

776
00:54:13.333 --> 00:54:14.459
[Kevin clears throat]

777
00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:17.837
All right.

778
00:54:19.339 --> 00:54:22.968
If that's the case. you should start
thinking about someone you know who would.

779
00:54:23.468 --> 00:54:25.053
We just moved in a couple months ago.

780
00:54:25.136 --> 00:54:27.263
We haven't had time to
meet the people around us.

781
00:54:27.639 --> 00:54:29.557
But what about enemies outside the area?

782
00:54:29.641 --> 00:54:31.267
Anyone who may harbor ill will?

783
00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:33.770
A scorned lover? A vendetta of some kind?

784
00:54:34.688 --> 00:54:38.775
No. No. I mean. I'm at work.
school. or home.

785
00:54:38.858 --> 00:54:41.569
I don't have time for interactions
outside of that right now.

786
00:54:41.903 --> 00:54:42.988
Mrs. Dadich?

787
00:54:44.155 --> 00:54:46.282
Mmm-mmm. No one.

788
00:54:46.366 --> 00:54:49.452
[Kevin] Isn't there a way to
trace back who posted this?

789
00:54:49.536 --> 00:54:52.664
Sure. Absolutely.
If. uh. the original hadn't been deleted.

790
00:54:52.747 --> 00:54:55.750
So that's it? I mean. what do we do?

791
00:54:56.001 --> 00:54:58.420
They think we're running some
sort of goddamn Nazi operation?

792
00:54:58.503 --> 00:55:01.506
-Okay. Kevin--
-They burned the car! Natalie.

793
00:55:04.259 --> 00:55:07.971
Listen. Mr. Dadich.
we are following the trail that we have.

794
00:55:08.179 --> 00:55:10.807
But if there's other information
you have to offer us.

795
00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:13.852
Anything out of the ordinary.
disturbances of some kind?

796
00:55:13.935 --> 00:55:15.395
That would be very helpful.

797
00:55:16.813 --> 00:55:19.357
No. nothing that immediately
comes to mind.

798
00:55:21.401 --> 00:55:22.610
No.

799
00:55:23.028 --> 00:55:24.029
Right.

800
00:55:25.447 --> 00:55:27.699
Well. if something does.

801
00:55:34.873 --> 00:55:38.293
Claudia. Hi. It's Natalie Dadich.

802
00:55:38.585 --> 00:55:41.421
I was just in the neighborhood. and…

803
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:44.340
these are for you.

804
00:55:44.424 --> 00:55:46.134
Oh! How nice.

805
00:55:48.053 --> 00:55:50.180
All right. Got the ball. Good boy.
Go get it!

806
00:55:50.263 --> 00:55:52.015
Go on! Go get it. Odi!

807
00:55:53.308 --> 00:55:55.143
The ball! Get… get the ball.

808
00:55:55.226 --> 00:55:56.644
Fancy meeting you here.

809
00:55:56.728 --> 00:55:58.104
-Hey.
-[chuckles]

810
00:55:58.521 --> 00:55:59.606
-Here.
-No.

811
00:55:59.856 --> 00:56:02.358
[Avery sighs] You look tired
and dehydrated. Take it. please?

812
00:56:02.692 --> 00:56:05.028
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

813
00:56:05.195 --> 00:56:08.698
Mmm. And thanks for meeting me here today.

814
00:56:09.532 --> 00:56:13.828
Between Natalie's family drama.
house. school.

815
00:56:13.912 --> 00:56:16.289
I just needed a normal conversation.

816
00:56:16.372 --> 00:56:17.791
-Happy I can help.
-Mmm.

817
00:56:19.459 --> 00:56:21.294
[Avery] Your dog sucks at fetch.

818
00:56:21.377 --> 00:56:23.046
[Kevin] Yeah. he does. Horrible.

819
00:56:24.506 --> 00:56:26.091
Here you go.

820
00:56:26.758 --> 00:56:29.552
Obviously what happened
the other night at the house

821
00:56:29.636 --> 00:56:34.390
was just people toying with us.
but there's still just some things that…

822
00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:38.228
[sighs] I don't know.
they're just… different.

823
00:56:39.437 --> 00:56:42.273
-You wanna know what happened.
-Yeah.

824
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:47.821
The truth is. I don't know.
Nobody does.

825
00:56:48.238 --> 00:56:51.241
Sure. we know the logistics.
but we don't know why.

826
00:56:52.283 --> 00:56:53.952
Jay could be an asshole.

827
00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:58.581
He was my older brother. and I love him.

828
00:57:00.041 --> 00:57:01.543
I loved him.

829
00:57:03.419 --> 00:57:05.255
When they were living out of state.

830
00:57:05.338 --> 00:57:08.466
Jay wasn't as faithful to to Erin
as he once promised.

831
00:57:08.591 --> 00:57:11.719
As you can imagine.
it didn't go over too well with Erin.

832
00:57:12.512 --> 00:57:14.264
So. she decided to get even.

833
00:57:15.515 --> 00:57:17.267
She had an affair. too?

834
00:57:18.226 --> 00:57:20.770
Some mystery man no one ever heard about.

835
00:57:21.438 --> 00:57:23.898
She never said his name. or who it was.

836
00:57:23.982 --> 00:57:26.943
-So Jay knew about it?
-Eventually.

837
00:57:27.694 --> 00:57:31.781
Thing is. all those women that Jay messed
around with. they were more like trophies.

838
00:57:31.865 --> 00:57:33.783
you know. But Erin…

839
00:57:34.451 --> 00:57:37.495
Erin. she had real feelings. Bang him…

840
00:57:37.579 --> 00:57:41.541
Well. she said it was a one-time thing.
but that bitch was up to something.

841
00:57:41.791 --> 00:57:42.792
[Claudia scoffs]

842
00:57:44.127 --> 00:57:48.798
Erin designed the house from the ground
up. but Jay paid for everything.

843
00:57:48.882 --> 00:57:51.885
Every single cent. no questions asked.

844
00:57:53.845 --> 00:57:56.764
My brother loved that woman to a fault.

845
00:57:58.266 --> 00:58:00.393
They were getting along better. too.

846
00:58:00.477 --> 00:58:05.607
I don't understand. If they were doing
so much better. then why…

847
00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:10.487
[911 dispatcher] What is your location?

848
00:58:10.570 --> 00:58:12.447
[Erin] I'm in my house…

849
00:58:16.201 --> 00:58:17.744
Between you and I…

850
00:58:18.995 --> 00:58:20.455
my brother didn't do it.

851
00:58:21.039 --> 00:58:24.918
Sure. he had a temper.
but he wasn't a murderer.

852
00:58:25.001 --> 00:58:27.337
And he certainly wouldn't commit suicide.

853
00:58:28.254 --> 00:58:31.674
And what. all of a sudden.
the cameras are all fucked up?

854
00:58:32.217 --> 00:58:33.218
Mmm-mmm.

855
00:58:33.468 --> 00:58:37.597
[clicks tongue] There was a lot of
little details that just didn't add up.

856
00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:41.518
The cops didn't care about any of that.

857
00:58:42.644 --> 00:58:44.896
It's not like it was a white man's murder.

858
00:58:47.232 --> 00:58:48.233
[door closes]

859
00:58:48.316 --> 00:58:50.151
I didn't know we had company.

860
00:58:54.113 --> 00:58:55.573
[Kevin] Oh. Oh. man.

861
00:58:55.657 --> 00:58:57.992
Please tell me you twisted your ankle
playing with my dog

862
00:58:58.076 --> 00:58:59.744
so I can make fun of you forever.

863
00:58:59.827 --> 00:59:01.955
I think it was a bee.
I think a bee got me.

864
00:59:02.038 --> 00:59:04.874
-A bee got you? A bee?
-Yes. Is it bad? Does it look bad?

865
00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:07.377
-Ah. there it is. Hold on. Hold on.
-Ow!

866
00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:09.879
-Got it. Right there.
-[groans]

867
00:59:09.963 --> 00:59:11.172
Oh. it's a big one.

868
00:59:11.256 --> 00:59:13.383
Are you okay. or are we gonna
have to amputate?

869
00:59:13.466 --> 00:59:15.343
[chuckles]
Think I'll get a second opinion.

870
00:59:16.219 --> 00:59:17.637
[both sigh]

871
00:59:21.266 --> 00:59:23.101
Hey. maybe you should check on Odi.

872
00:59:24.143 --> 00:59:25.687
[Odi whimpering]

873
00:59:28.022 --> 00:59:28.982
Odi.

874
00:59:29.274 --> 00:59:30.900
Odi. come here. bud. [clapping hands]

875
00:59:32.235 --> 00:59:33.194
Odi.

876
00:59:35.613 --> 00:59:39.158
-I've never seen him like this.
-[Avery] I'll get some water.

877
00:59:40.034 --> 00:59:42.912
Natalie. Natalie. [clears throat]

878
00:59:43.663 --> 00:59:46.374
Uh. I'm… I'm so sorry for the intrusion.

879
00:59:46.457 --> 00:59:50.420
No. No. I… I'm sorry for
making you uncomfortable.

880
00:59:50.837 --> 00:59:53.631
Claudia just springs things on me
sometimes. I just…

881
00:59:53.715 --> 00:59:55.091
She runs her mouth a lot.

882
00:59:55.383 --> 00:59:57.677
Normal husband. wife stuff.
You know how it is.

883
00:59:57.885 --> 01:00:00.054
So you're having some…
some problems with the house?

884
01:00:01.764 --> 01:00:04.142
I may have heard a little more
than I was supposed to.

885
01:00:04.684 --> 01:00:06.769
I… I'm sure it's fine.

886
01:00:07.145 --> 01:00:09.814
You know. I think.
given the shock of everything…

887
01:00:10.565 --> 01:00:13.568
Claudia may have acted
a little impulsively.

888
01:00:14.652 --> 01:00:16.237
If you're having trouble with it.

889
01:00:16.654 --> 01:00:20.575
I'd be willing to negotiate with you.
Buy the house back.

890
01:00:22.118 --> 01:00:23.578
Not much less than you paid.

891
01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:26.247
Less?

892
01:00:27.081 --> 01:00:30.543
Yeah. given the issues.
I'm sure that depreciates the value.

893
01:00:31.961 --> 01:00:34.839
Well. thank you for the offer. but. um…

894
01:00:35.381 --> 01:00:38.092
I just don't think we can
take the hit right now.

895
01:00:38.926 --> 01:00:40.595
Sorry for the intrusion.

896
01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:47.226
You and your husband took advantage
of a woman not in her right mind.

897
01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:50.772
All he left her was that house.

898
01:00:52.065 --> 01:00:56.569
And you two swiped it out from under her
like a free meal.

899
01:00:59.739 --> 01:01:01.324
[cell phone ringing. vibrating]

900
01:01:06.537 --> 01:01:07.747
Think about what I said.

901
01:01:13.878 --> 01:01:15.004
Kevin.

902
01:01:16.047 --> 01:01:18.383
Hey. Hey. hey. hey. slow down.
What's wrong?

903
01:01:24.639 --> 01:01:28.309
Hi. I'm Avery. Kevin's class partner.

904
01:01:28.559 --> 01:01:30.353
I mentioned that a couple weeks ago.

905
01:01:31.604 --> 01:01:33.940
Right. I must've forgotten.

906
01:01:34.023 --> 01:01:35.817
Well. I'm gonna…

907
01:01:37.944 --> 01:01:39.654
Bye. buddy. Feel better.

908
01:01:41.614 --> 01:01:42.824
Nice to meet you.

909
01:01:43.157 --> 01:01:44.826
-See you in class.
-Yeah. Thanks.

910
01:01:48.871 --> 01:01:49.872
What?

911
01:01:50.832 --> 01:01:52.959
All right. let's get to it.

912
01:01:53.584 --> 01:01:56.713
We ran Odi's blood work.
I'm gonna be honest here.

913
01:01:56.796 --> 01:02:00.341
Between that and his physical.
it doesn't look good.

914
01:02:02.051 --> 01:02:03.845
How not good is it?

915
01:02:03.928 --> 01:02:08.182
His blood contains elements of a powerful
toxin causing his health to deteriorate.

916
01:02:08.599 --> 01:02:11.728
It's usually due to something
the dog accidentally ingested.

917
01:02:11.811 --> 01:02:14.981
But the root of it is that
his heart is giving out on him.

918
01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:17.900
Well. is this something that we can treat?

919
01:02:18.192 --> 01:02:20.903
-It'll really just be prolonging the pain.
-[Odi whimpering]

920
01:02:22.113 --> 01:02:25.992
Take the time you need. Talk about it.

921
01:02:26.075 --> 01:02:28.077
[somber instrumental music playing]

922
01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:43.009
[person exhales]

923
01:02:56.898 --> 01:02:59.317
How could you not tell me
something like that?

924
01:03:01.402 --> 01:03:03.613
[sighs] I just…

925
01:03:04.906 --> 01:03:07.283
I didn't want it to cause any issues.

926
01:03:08.826 --> 01:03:12.038
Well. I'm going to call you out on
your bad judgment there. Nat.

927
01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:16.375
This deal could change everything.

928
01:03:16.459 --> 01:03:20.379
I wasn't in a position to turn it down.
I had already signed the paperwork.

929
01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:23.382
but I swear. I had no idea.

930
01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.428
Have you been meeting him?

931
01:03:33.267 --> 01:03:34.268
It's just work.

932
01:03:34.352 --> 01:03:37.939
Whole goddamn city full of people.
and you have to work with him?

933
01:03:38.022 --> 01:03:40.107
Exactly. okay. Have to.

934
01:03:40.191 --> 01:03:42.985
-Look. I don't have a choice.
-Bullshit.

935
01:03:47.031 --> 01:03:48.699
You chose your work…

936
01:03:50.034 --> 01:03:52.119
over my feelings. over our marriage.

937
01:03:52.203 --> 01:03:56.123
-No. that's not true. It is not like that.
-He's trying to get in your pants.

938
01:03:58.960 --> 01:03:59.877
Oh.

939
01:04:02.421 --> 01:04:03.923
Isn't that what you said last time?

940
01:04:05.299 --> 01:04:06.259
Yeah.

941
01:04:08.761 --> 01:04:10.721
I remember that pretty fucking clearly.

942
01:04:20.606 --> 01:04:21.774
[scratching]

943
01:04:22.775 --> 01:04:24.527
God damn it. Odi.

944
01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:33.160
[doorknob rattling]

945
01:04:34.328 --> 01:04:35.371
Kevin.

946
01:04:36.414 --> 01:04:37.915
-Kevin. [shushes]
-What?

947
01:04:40.501 --> 01:04:41.878
Someone's at the door.

948
01:04:44.463 --> 01:04:46.465
-I don't hear anything.
-Kevin. I swear to God.

949
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:47.592
Okay. calm down.

950
01:04:49.969 --> 01:04:51.637
[doorknob rattling]

951
01:04:55.308 --> 01:04:56.267
Don't move.

952
01:04:56.350 --> 01:04:59.729
-What the fuck do we do?
-Get your phone ready to call the cops.

953
01:05:02.189 --> 01:05:04.442
My phone's not here.
Kevin. my fucking phone's not here.

954
01:05:04.525 --> 01:05:05.651
Okay. Stay calm.

955
01:05:05.776 --> 01:05:07.153
-[banging]
-[Natalie gasps]

956
01:05:08.321 --> 01:05:10.781
Kevin. Kevin. don't fucking
leave me up here.

957
01:05:10.865 --> 01:05:13.284
[dramatic music playing]

958
01:05:37.099 --> 01:05:40.186
So. after you entered the kitchen.
you didn't hear any other noises?

959
01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:42.146
No open doors. nothing?

960
01:05:43.189 --> 01:05:44.982
And no physical description?

961
01:05:47.151 --> 01:05:49.236
There wasn't anyone there to describe.

962
01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.781
Hey. I'm just trying to jog your memory.

963
01:05:57.912 --> 01:06:00.456
Okay. we'll write up a report.

964
01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:05.461
If anything else comes to mind.
feel free to reach out to me directly.

965
01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:08.047
-There is one other thing.
-Nat.

966
01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:11.425
If you could not make me feel
like a lunatic. that would be great.

967
01:06:12.259 --> 01:06:16.055
-I've been having these… [sighs]
-Nightmares.

968
01:06:20.226 --> 01:06:25.898
-There is this man. He's rail thin. pale.
-In the home?

969
01:06:25.982 --> 01:06:28.859
Yes. I swear to you. I saw him.

970
01:06:28.943 --> 01:06:31.779
He crawled out into my hallway
and then he attacked me.

971
01:06:35.908 --> 01:06:41.205
Right. so you… you had a pale man crawl
into your hallway and attack you?

972
01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:44.291
And you didn't think to report it?

973
01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:49.213
No. Because. like Kevin mentioned. at the
time. I thought it was just nightmares.

974
01:06:49.296 --> 01:06:54.010
But then things. they started disappearing
and reappearing in other places.

975
01:06:54.093 --> 01:06:56.804
There was this tennis ball
that he put on my bed.

976
01:06:56.887 --> 01:06:59.265
Okay. so he put a tennis ball…

977
01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:01.892
on your bed?

978
01:07:01.976 --> 01:07:06.147
No. the tennis ball. it was underneath
my bed and I could not reach it.

979
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:10.401
So I went to grab something. and when I
came back. he had put it back on my bed.

980
01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:15.698
Okay. Okay.

981
01:07:16.449 --> 01:07:19.160
Tall. pale man. tennis ball. hallway.

982
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:21.871
Got it.

983
01:07:23.372 --> 01:07:24.874
[indistinct radio chatter]

984
01:07:26.417 --> 01:07:27.585
We'll be in touch.

985
01:07:28.669 --> 01:07:29.795
[clears throat]

986
01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:33.632
-Oh. we found your phone in the kitchen.
-[Kevin] Thank you.

987
01:07:36.802 --> 01:07:37.845
[Kevin sighs]

988
01:07:40.097 --> 01:07:42.808
I hope you know how insane
that made us just seem.

989
01:07:44.602 --> 01:07:47.855
Okay. you know what. Kevin.
your wife is sitting with the cops.

990
01:07:47.938 --> 01:07:51.192
telling them that she doesn't feel safe.
that I am terrified.

991
01:07:51.275 --> 01:07:52.651
and that's your response?

992
01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:56.280
Someone just vandalized our house. Kevin.
You don't think it's within the realm

993
01:07:56.363 --> 01:07:59.033
of possibility that someone
could be breaking into our house?

994
01:07:59.116 --> 01:08:01.243
Not to move tennis balls
and house keys around. No.

995
01:08:01.368 --> 01:08:03.037
Well. you know what.
let me remind you

996
01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:06.082
that I am not the only one who heard
whatever was in our house tonight.

997
01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:08.000
-okay. so--
-What do you want me to do. Nat?

998
01:08:08.084 --> 01:08:11.796
I don't know. Kevin. We have a house full
of cameras. Maybe that's a good place…

999
01:08:11.879 --> 01:08:13.881
Do you have any idea
how expensive that would be?

1000
01:08:13.964 --> 01:08:17.635
My guess would be less than our funerals
whenever someone murders us in our sleep.

1001
01:08:17.718 --> 01:08:19.512
Okay. pump the brakes on the melodrama.

1002
01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:21.806
What we need to be buying is a new car.

1003
01:08:22.014 --> 01:08:24.642
To replace the rental that
we're spending a fortune on.

1004
01:08:25.059 --> 01:08:26.894
We can't afford this right now.

1005
01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:30.815
[drill whirring]

1006
01:08:30.898 --> 01:08:33.734
So. uh. once you're logged in.
you'll be able to control the locks

1007
01:08:33.818 --> 01:08:35.402
from any room in the house.

1008
01:08:35.486 --> 01:08:40.616
So. red means locked. Green. Easy as that.

1009
01:08:41.158 --> 01:08:43.077
Right now everything's running smoothly.

1010
01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.538
If you start experiencing
some glitching. give us a call.

1011
01:08:45.621 --> 01:08:49.333
If it's a consistent problem.
we might have to replace the whole system.

1012
01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:50.835
Excellent.

1013
01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:08.144
I asked for a completed sample rack

1014
01:09:08.602 --> 01:09:12.439
with 15 additional samples
by the time I got back.

1015
01:09:12.815 --> 01:09:14.525
-I know.
-And what?

1016
01:09:15.693 --> 01:09:19.530
It's two weeks later
and I have half that.

1017
01:09:19.613 --> 01:09:20.739
I know.

1018
01:09:21.198 --> 01:09:25.119
As a person. I am empathetic to
the shitstorm that is your life right now.

1019
01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:30.207
But as your boss. I warned you
what you would be getting into.

1020
01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:33.460
I don't know what to say.

1021
01:09:34.336 --> 01:09:37.423
If you had any idea
how embarrassed I am…

a story like that. facts actually matter.

-[thud. groans]

1183
01:20:51.263 --> 01:20:52.472
-Kevin!
-[groans]

1184
01:20:52.556 --> 01:20:56.226
Oh. my God. Someone help!
Someone call 911!

1185
01:20:56.309 --> 01:20:59.563
Baby. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
It's okay.

1186
01:20:59.646 --> 01:21:01.523
Someone call 911!

1187
01:21:05.068 --> 01:21:06.736
Mrs. Dadich.

1188
01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:08.738
He is coherent.
and there are no indications

1189
01:21:08.822 --> 01:21:11.533
of any memory loss
or other physical trauma.

1190
01:21:11.658 --> 01:21:16.329
-Okay. So. what happened?
-Uh. why don't you have a seat? Please.

1191
01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:24.421
Are you aware of something called Nerium?

1192
01:21:25.881 --> 01:21:29.384
-No.
-It's a lethal poisoning agent.

1193
01:21:29.467 --> 01:21:32.095
And the reason I ask
is because we found traces of it

1194
01:21:32.178 --> 01:21:33.680
in your husband's bloodstream.

1195
01:21:33.763 --> 01:21:37.309
Now. taken in small doses
over a prolonged period of time.

1196
01:21:37.392 --> 01:21:42.147
it can lead to health deteriorations.
ranging from vomiting or muscle weakness

1197
01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:48.153
to seizures or arrhythmic heart function.
sometimes mistaken as cardiac arrest.

1198
01:21:49.195 --> 01:21:51.489
You have any idea
how that got into his blood?

1199
01:21:55.452 --> 01:21:56.703
I wanna see Kevin.

1200
01:21:56.786 --> 01:21:58.622
-I can't let that--
-It's my husband.

1201
01:21:58.705 --> 01:22:01.750
-What do you mean you can't allow me to--
-I understand that. Mrs. Dadich.

1202
01:22:01.833 --> 01:22:05.503
But he's with the authorities right now.
So. why don't you just have a seat?

1203
01:22:06.838 --> 01:22:09.424
[Richardson] No. I am
on your side. Natalie.

1204
01:22:09.507 --> 01:22:11.176
Well. it doesn't feel like it.

1205
01:22:11.259 --> 01:22:13.011
But I'm just trying to understand.

1206
01:22:13.094 --> 01:22:15.055
According to
Mr. Dadich's hospital records.

1207
01:22:15.138 --> 01:22:17.724
he's been exposed to this substance
for quite some time now.

1208
01:22:17.807 --> 01:22:19.935
What? Why would I try
and kill my husband

1209
01:22:20.018 --> 01:22:22.771
after working so hard
to rebuild our marriage?

1210
01:22:22.854 --> 01:22:25.231
Oh. maybe because this Nick Scott guy
comes back into town.

1211
01:22:25.315 --> 01:22:26.149
Oh. my God.

1212
01:22:26.232 --> 01:22:28.109
You decide you wanna have a life with him.

1213
01:22:28.193 --> 01:22:31.154
Young. stable. handsome.
Also. he's kick-starting your career.

1214
01:22:31.237 --> 01:22:33.949
-I love my husband.
-Maybe a chemical imbalance in the brain.

1215
01:22:34.032 --> 01:22:35.909
There's footage of you running around
the house

1216
01:22:36.034 --> 01:22:38.703
-from an invisible intruder.
-There was someone in my house!

1217
01:22:38.787 --> 01:22:40.956
Maybe because you just realized…

1218
01:22:41.039 --> 01:22:43.875
your husband is
never going to forgive you.

1219
01:22:51.257 --> 01:22:52.968
Oh. is this you
ending our conversation?

1220
01:22:53.051 --> 01:22:56.429
Well. if I'm not under arrest.
I'd like to get back to work now.

1221
01:22:57.889 --> 01:22:59.099
By all means.

1222
01:23:02.185 --> 01:23:03.687
[door opens. closes]

1223
01:23:12.278 --> 01:23:13.363
[camera beeps]

1224
01:23:21.579 --> 01:23:24.290
-How're you feeling?
-Better than yesterday. I guess.

1225
01:23:26.751 --> 01:23:28.753
Uh. hey. I was gonna
make us dinner tonight.

1226
01:23:29.963 --> 01:23:32.257
Is there anything you want to request?

1227
01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:34.801
You know. I've got to work
on the project again.

1228
01:23:34.884 --> 01:23:37.846
-With Avery?
-Yeah.

1229
01:23:38.763 --> 01:23:41.266
Are you sure that you should be
pushing yourself like that?

1230
01:23:41.349 --> 01:23:42.976
You just got out of the hospital.

1231
01:23:43.101 --> 01:23:46.146
It's half our grade.
I don't really know that we have a choice.

1232
01:23:49.858 --> 01:23:53.611
Plus. we're running behind. I don't wanna
make her lift all the dead weight.

1233
01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:58.742
You don't wanna take your lunch?

1234
01:23:59.159 --> 01:24:01.745
No. I'm not feeling up to a whole meal.

1235
01:24:03.038 --> 01:24:04.330
Start light. [chuckles]

1236
01:24:06.124 --> 01:24:08.084
-Bye. Nat.
-Bye.

1237
01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:12.422
[doorbell rings]

1238
01:24:22.307 --> 01:24:24.476
Hi. Can I help you?

1239
01:24:25.018 --> 01:24:31.191
Sor… Sorry. uh…
You're just such a beautiful woman.

1240
01:24:32.108 --> 01:24:33.735
I think you have the wrong house.

1241
01:24:34.861 --> 01:24:40.658
Oh… you really just like to
get right into things. huh?

1242
01:24:41.785 --> 01:24:43.703
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

1243
01:24:43.787 --> 01:24:46.247
-Hey. what are you doing?
-[both grunt]

1244
01:24:46.331 --> 01:24:47.916
[Natalie panting. grunts]

1245
01:24:47.999 --> 01:24:50.835
Chica. you really do
like to put up a fight.

1246
01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:53.671
-[both grunting]
-[man] Come here.

1247
01:24:53.755 --> 01:24:55.715
-[struggling]
-Come here. Hey. hey!

1248
01:24:55.799 --> 01:24:57.884
I was just kinda hoping
you'd be wearing a dress.

1249
01:24:57.967 --> 01:25:00.929
make this a little easier
on me. huh? [sniffs]

1250
01:25:01.012 --> 01:25:03.056
[Natalie cries]

1251
01:25:03.139 --> 01:25:05.767
[grunts] Jesus Christ. lady!
What the f…

1252
01:25:05.850 --> 01:25:09.062
-[both grunting]
-[Natalie screams]

1253
01:25:09.145 --> 01:25:11.981
-Don't fight. It's a mistake…
-[Natalie grunts]

1254
01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:16.319
[Natalie screams]

1255
01:25:16.402 --> 01:25:19.239
[Natalie struggles. cries]

1256
01:25:20.031 --> 01:25:22.450
-[both grunt]
-[Natalie panting]

1257
01:25:30.959 --> 01:25:34.838
[Richardson] Got some good news for you.
We were able to ID your attacker.

1258
01:25:34.921 --> 01:25:36.714
Travis Murray.

1259
01:25:36.798 --> 01:25:40.468
Your camera caught him canvassing
the house just before the attack.

1260
01:25:40.552 --> 01:25:43.096
We have reason to believe
he's been watching your house

1261
01:25:43.179 --> 01:25:45.431
-for quite some time now.
-So what do we do now?

1262
01:25:45.515 --> 01:25:47.642
We get a lawyer. press charges?

1263
01:25:47.725 --> 01:25:50.395
Uh. well. not exactly.

1264
01:25:50.478 --> 01:25:53.064
We aren't actually able
to place him under arrest.

1265
01:25:53.148 --> 01:25:55.316
-[Natalie] What?
-There is an investigation

1266
01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:58.361
that has dug up some information
relieving Travis of all charges.

1267
01:25:58.444 --> 01:26:00.446
What do you mean? He broke into our house.

1268
01:26:00.530 --> 01:26:03.825
Robert Sorrentino. the man who sold you
the house in which you currently reside.

1269
01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:07.287
-What does he have to do with anything?
-Sorrentino has been taken into custody

1270
01:26:07.370 --> 01:26:10.456
just a couple of hours ago.
He admitted to his involvement.

1271
01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:13.877
[Kevin] What are you saying? He sent
some stranger to our house to attack her?

1272
01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:18.798
Our detectives found an online post
in Travis Murray's search history.

1273
01:26:20.258 --> 01:26:22.969
[clears throat] It disclosed
Mrs. Dadich's name

1274
01:26:23.052 --> 01:26:26.764
in addition to a photograph
pulled from an online source.

1275
01:26:26.848 --> 01:26:29.475
"I prefer to be taken by surprise?"

1276
01:26:29.559 --> 01:26:33.813
Yeah. It was an ad
listed under the personals

1277
01:26:33.938 --> 01:26:38.693
and intended to portray Mrs. Dadich
as a lonely. unsatisfied housewife

1278
01:26:38.776 --> 01:26:42.822
with a fetish for spontaneous.
submissive sex. preferably with strangers.

1279
01:26:43.865 --> 01:26:48.494
Luckily. our detectives were able to trace
the IP address directly to Robert.

1280
01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:52.290
Robert also admitted to posting
the initial listing

1281
01:26:52.373 --> 01:26:54.542
that provoked the vandalism to your house

1282
01:26:54.626 --> 01:26:56.920
as well as purchasing
the magazine subscriptions.

1283
01:26:57.003 --> 01:27:00.131
Mr. Sorrentino claims
he wasn't trying to inflict harm.

1284
01:27:00.215 --> 01:27:04.010
just trying to scare you all.
hoping you'd forfeit the purchase.

1285
01:27:04.093 --> 01:27:08.514
He nearly had my wife raped and beaten.

1286
01:27:08.598 --> 01:27:12.518
She is so traumatized
she can't sleep in our house.

1287
01:27:12.602 --> 01:27:16.648
He poisoned my dog to death and tried
to do the same fucking thing to me!

1288
01:27:16.731 --> 01:27:18.733
Hey. well. hold on.
Hold on. Mr. Dadich.

1289
01:27:18.816 --> 01:27:23.404
As of now. Mr. Sorrentino denies
ever personally entering the property.

1290
01:27:23.488 --> 01:27:26.699
He says he has no knowledge
of the other attacks against your wife

1291
01:27:26.783 --> 01:27:29.744
-and has never been exposed to the Nerium.
-No shit.

1292
01:27:30.161 --> 01:27:31.788
Of course. he'd fucking deny it.

1293
01:27:31.871 --> 01:27:35.208
Fraud is one thing. but attempted murder?
You're just gonna sit on this shit?

1294
01:27:35.291 --> 01:27:39.504
Hey. listen. we have our men working
around the clock to get a confession.

1295
01:27:39.587 --> 01:27:43.591
We're still holding him on the charges
he's taken responsibility for.

1296
01:27:43.675 --> 01:27:45.510
I thought you said
there's some good news.

1297
01:27:45.593 --> 01:27:47.220
Well. there is.

1298
01:27:47.428 --> 01:27:49.764
Upon questioning him.
we now have reason to believe

1299
01:27:49.847 --> 01:27:54.310
he has a certain level of involvement
with the death of the previous homeowners.

1300
01:27:54.394 --> 01:27:56.896
-How so?
-Well. unbeknownst to Mrs. Sorrentino.

1301
01:27:56.980 --> 01:27:59.524
Robert had accumulated
a significant amount of debt.

1302
01:27:59.607 --> 01:28:03.403
Your house. knowingly left to him
by his brother-in-law…

1303
01:28:03.486 --> 01:28:06.114
was the only financial venture
he had going.

1304
01:28:08.616 --> 01:28:09.701
[person exhales]

1305
01:28:10.952 --> 01:28:12.578
[Kevin] I should've listened to you.

1306
01:28:14.122 --> 01:28:15.456
I'm sorry

1307
01:28:19.711 --> 01:28:22.213
[Natalie sighs heavily]

1308
01:28:24.882 --> 01:28:30.221
I was just tricking myself
into believing that

1309
01:28:30.305 --> 01:28:34.100
if I just waited it out.
you'd come around.

1310
01:28:36.394 --> 01:28:42.066
But you and I both know that you're never
really gonna trust me again…

1311
01:28:43.609 --> 01:28:45.445
not 100%.

1312
01:28:53.369 --> 01:28:57.373
I think that we should
talk about separating…

1313
01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:02.503
at least for a little while.

1314
01:29:07.342 --> 01:29:08.634
[sighs]

1315
01:29:48.841 --> 01:29:49.926
Hmm.

1316
01:29:53.429 --> 01:29:56.849
[professor] This is half your grade.
Don't mess around.

1317
01:29:56.933 --> 01:30:00.728
Check in with each other. Check in
with me. I'm here after class.

1318
01:30:01.479 --> 01:30:03.731
[muffled] Some of you already know that.

1319
01:30:54.532 --> 01:30:55.575
[sighs]

1320
01:31:17.513 --> 01:31:18.347
[line ringing]

1321
01:31:18.431 --> 01:31:20.349
[Kevin] How much did you
pay for those shoes?

1322
01:31:20.433 --> 01:31:22.727
-[Avery] Oh. you don't wanna know.
-I don't wanna know?

1323
01:31:22.810 --> 01:31:26.189
-'Cause they look just like--
-[Avery] Kind of obscene. to be honest.

1324
01:31:26.397 --> 01:31:27.607
[line ringing]

1325
01:31:29.859 --> 01:31:32.653
-[cell phone vibrating]
-You should answer the phone.

1326
01:31:35.239 --> 01:31:36.991
I mean. what's the point?

1327
01:31:37.074 --> 01:31:40.119
She made it very clear that
she doesn't want me to come home.

1328
01:31:40.703 --> 01:31:42.330
She's your wife.

1329
01:31:43.122 --> 01:31:44.790
You should answer the phone.

1330
01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:52.173
-[voicemail beeps]
-Hey. it's me.

1331
01:31:53.257 --> 01:31:54.550
Um…

1332
01:31:56.135 --> 01:31:58.012
I don't even know where to start.

1333
01:31:59.722 --> 01:32:03.059
I'm sorry for what I said last night.

1334
01:32:04.143 --> 01:32:05.728
I didn't mean it.

1335
01:32:06.938 --> 01:32:09.899
[Natalie over phone] I. uh. assume that
you're still at work. but

1336
01:32:09.982 --> 01:32:13.152
if you come home soon. I'd really
love to spend some time with you.

1337
01:32:13.236 --> 01:32:16.739
I love you. I'll be up. Call me.

1338
01:32:24.997 --> 01:32:26.874
I don't get it. [scoffs]

1339
01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:29.377
That's the thing about people.

1340
01:32:31.045 --> 01:32:32.672
They change their minds…

1341
01:32:34.257 --> 01:32:36.217
a lot. actually. [chuckles]

1342
01:32:39.428 --> 01:32:43.641
You know. um. we could just
pick this up tomorrow.

1343
