573

would listen to me.

00:28:47.859 --> 00:28:49.294
I realized Karl
hadn't come home last night.

577
00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.196
And then I came down
and saw the kitchen

578
00:28:51.262 --> 00:28:53.164
and the great room and-and--

579
00:28:53.231 --> 00:28:55.333
-And I knew something
was wrong.
-Mm.

580
00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.903
You didn't notice the kitchen
or the great room last night?

But I was exhausted
when I got home.

585
00:29:08.113 --> 00:29:10.648
so I went upstairs
to close my eyes for a minute
and do some affirmations.

586
00:29:10.715 --> 00:29:12.951
and I knew something was wrong
'cause Karl never woke me.

00:29:13.017 --> 00:29:14.419
And I came downstairs.
and then I saw this.

588
00:29:14.486 --> 00:29:17.355

your husband?
