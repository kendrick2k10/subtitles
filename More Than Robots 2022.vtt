3
00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:22.564
Confirmed it. Other side now.

4
00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:25.316
All right. Be careful
that there's-- It's on the other side.

5
00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.536
The batteries are secured to it.

6
00:00:37.328 --> 00:00:38.329
Yeah.

7
00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:44.461
- Huh? Right now?
- No. we--

8
00:00:50.842 --> 00:00:52.302
Run the batteries. We've gotta go.

9
00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:55.055
We have a minute. 50 seconds to go.

10
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.601
- Yeah. let's go. Let's go.
- I know.

11
00:01:00.977 --> 00:01:02.687
TeraWatts! TeraWatts!

12
00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:11.905
Let's do it!

13
00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:15.408
All right. A minute. 30 seconds.

14
00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:18.286
We gotta go.

15
00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:21.956
All right. Let's go.
Let's go. let's go. let's go.

16
00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:30.090
Alliance Captains. 3512.

17
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.800
<i>Spartatroniks.</i>

18
00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:41.226
Red Alliance!

19
00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:46.940
Our second set of quarterfinals returns.

20
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.234
Our fourth seed alliance in red.

21
00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:52.070
Our fifth seed alliance in blue.

22
00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:55.448
Let's meet 'em. 1515!

23
00:01:55.532 --> 00:01:58.159
<i>MorTorq.</i>

24
00:01:59.035 --> 00:02:02.997
Alliance captains. 5553!

00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:10.338
And. last but not least. 6904!

27
00:02:10.422 --> 00:02:13.174
<i>The TeraWatts.</i>

28
00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:15.635
Go! Go. TeraWatts!

29
00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:17.971
- Hey. is everything all good?
- Everything good. Good.

30
00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:20.974
Drivers. behind the lines!

31
00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:24.019
There we go. He's good.
He's good now. He's good. He's ready.

32
00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:29.149
Three. Two. One. Go!

33
00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.886
The way my brain works.
I can't think of things in words.

34
00:02:57.886 --> 00:03:00.555
I think in feelings and numbers.

35
00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:05.685
The feelings that numbers give me--
Well. the number two...

36
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:10.315
I'm facing south and I'm looking at
the corner of a building.

37
00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:17.489
The number three. it can be a tree.
It can be something purple.

38
00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:22.827
The number four is something bright.

39
00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:29.084
It's like a star in the night sky.
or red and green.

40
00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:32.837
My brain makes way too many connections.

41
00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:39.511
Jacob was always very curious
about how things worked.

42
00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:46.142
Jacob was a very happy baby.
Always smiling. Always bouncing.

43
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.436
He's always been blond.

44
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.983
and his hair would grow out
in a perfect halo around his head.

45
00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:58.196
He always had this perfect.
round head of hair.

46
00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:02.200
He would sit and write numbers out.

47
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.494
Cover a sheet of paper. Start a new one.

48
00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:06.538
Cover the page with numbers.

49
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.083
And he was always fascinated
with airplanes.

50
00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:13.294
I had this idea of working for SpaceX.

51
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.007
I used to be
kind of interested in rockets.

52
00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:18.550
I thought they were cool.

53
00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:22.554
I-I still think they are.
but not as cool as math.

54
00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:34.691
The structure and harmonies
of classical music.

55
00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:39.446
they work because of some
mathematical concepts.

56
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.865
There's a certain pattern that we track.

57
00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:46.036
and if it produces joy
or produces sadness.

58
00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:47.245
it's based on math.

59
00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:50.040
I messed up.

60
00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:53.376
I-I can't handle it when I mess up.

61
00:04:57.714 --> 00:05:00.258
At school. everyone is cool.

62
00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:03.803
People skills were a bit of an issue.

63
00:05:03.887 --> 00:05:05.722
I wouldn't say
they were a bit of an issue.

64
00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:08.475
but they--
I didn't understand stuff at first.

65
00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:10.977
I didn't understand popular culture.

66
00:05:11.061 --> 00:05:13.313
I understand a little bit of it now.

67
00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:18.693
but I'm not an expert.
but everyone else is an expert.

68
00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:23.073
I'd never really. like.
been a part of a team before.

69
00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:27.827
I needed to be an expert
at literally everything. which I can't be.

70
00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:33.041
I was at the club fair.

71
00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:37.962
and there was this huge table.
and there was a pile of metal.

72
00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:41.257
I walked over.
and it wasn't a pile of metal.

73
00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:42.467
It was a robot.

74
00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:48.098
And they said it's a robotics team.

75
00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:50.892
and I was hooked.

76
00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:03.571
You tightened it too high up here.

77
00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:04.656
Okay.

78
00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:10.286
I made a lot of friends
being part of a team.

79
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.705
which was new for me.

80
00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:18.420
I work on coding
the control panel mechanism for the robot.

81
00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:22.590
I get to connect with a lot of people.

82
00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:26.803
And we get to chat all we want
about this one particular thing

83
00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:29.097
that's been in my mind
for what seems like ages.

84
00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:34.227
I think it's good because it fits me.

85
00:06:39.983 --> 00:06:45.572
Hello. everybody. and welcome.
This is the 1996 US FIRST National Finals.

86
00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:46.906
<i>This is FIRST.</i>

87
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.493
<i>For Inspiration and Recognition
of Science and Technology.</i>

88
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:55.582
<i>A worldwide program that combines
the high-intensity world of sports</i>

89
00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:59.586
<i>with STEM education. science.
technology. engineering and math.</i>

90
00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:04.299
Please welcome to the podium
FIRST founder. Dean Kamen.

91
00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:07.093
<i>Dean Kamen created the Segway scooter.</i>

92
00:07:07.177 --> 00:07:09.846
<i>the insulin pump
and the portable dialysis machine.</i>

93
00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:11.931
<i>just to name a few of his big innovations.</i>

94
00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:14.100
<i>And Dean is not just inventing things.</i>

95
00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:17.187
<i>He's created a platform for young.
passionate engineers</i>

96
00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:18.855
<i>to follow in his footsteps.</i>

97
00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:20.732
How do you take

98
00:07:20.732 --> 00:07:25.653
all the critical elements of science.
technology and engineering and innovation.

99
00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:28.406
and put 'em in a format
that kids can appreciate?

100
00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:31.493
I know! We'll make a robotics competition.

101
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.953
<i>Each year. teams of high school students</i>

102
00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:37.123
<i>dedicate weeks of their lives
to designing.</i>

103
00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:38.917
<i>building and programming a robot.</i>

104
00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:44.839
We wanted FIRST to be a microcosm
of the real world of engineering.

105
00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:47.342
Thought robots would be ideal

106
00:07:47.342 --> 00:07:51.930
because it's easy to include every
different kind of engineering discipline

107
00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.890
that kids might be interested in.

108
00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:57.686
Back in the '70s. we wanted to
make sure that MIT students

109
00:07:57.686 --> 00:07:59.938
not only got good analytical thinking

110
00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:02.023
but got in touch
with their creative skill.

111
00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:06.152
So we gave 'em a kit of materials and said
build something to accomplish a task.

112
00:08:06.945 --> 00:08:10.740
Wasn't too surprising that MIT students
would compete like crazy.

113
00:08:11.616 --> 00:08:14.911
But it was really wonderful to note
that they worked together.

114
00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:16.955
taught each other everything they know.

115
00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:20.417
When we started this.
there were 20-some-odd teams.

116
00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:22.460
The next year we went to 100.

117
00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:24.587
The next year we went to 200.

118
00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:28.258
Now we have thousands and thousands
of teams all around the world.

119
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.319
Every year. our live kickoff happens
the first weekend after the New Year.

120
00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:53.283
And on the day of kickoff.
we'd unveil the new challenge.

121
00:08:55.118 --> 00:08:57.162
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

122
00:08:58.204 --> 00:09:00.749
I'm excited. I've been waiting
to find out this game for a while.

123
00:09:00.749 --> 00:09:02.751
That's just all I've been thinking.

124
00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:07.047
Excitement. mostly.
to start creating a new robot

125
00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:09.632
and process more information.

126
00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:15.263
A bit.

127
00:09:15.347 --> 00:09:19.976
Five. four. three. two. one!

128
00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:28.443
Welcome to the 2020
FIRST Robotics Competition Kickoff.

129
00:09:28.443 --> 00:09:33.656
Now this season. <i>The FIRST Rise</i>.
powered by <i>Star Wars: Force for Change</i>.

130
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:39.412
inspires us to work together to strengthen
and protect the force that binds us all.

131
00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:43.666
Our friends at Disney and Lucasfilm
are right behind you.

132
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.418
cheering on your success.

133
00:09:45.502 --> 00:09:47.629
So right now. let's hear from them.

134
00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:52.550
<i>Hello. FIRST teams.
I'm Mark Hamill. and welcome...</i>

135
00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:57.389
<i>to the 2019-2020 season.</i>

136
00:09:57.389 --> 00:10:00.850
<i>This year. FIRST is teaming up with
Disney and Lucasfilm</i>

137
00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:03.812
<i>as part of the</i>
Star Wars: Force for Change <i>initiative.</i>

138
00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:07.190
Each year.
we create an engineering challenge

139
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:10.318
that's entirely different
from the year before.

140
00:10:10.902 --> 00:10:13.947
and we work really hard to make sure

141
00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:19.411
that there is no obvious best strategy
to win the game.

142
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.998
<i>In Infinite Recharge.
forces threaten the future of FIRST City.</i>

143
00:10:24.708 --> 00:10:26.876
<i>With assistance from your trusty droids.</i>

144
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.921
<i>you and your crew will race
to overcome obstacles</i>

145
00:10:30.005 --> 00:10:34.509
<i>and collect renewable energy cells
to charge your city's Shield Generator</i>

146
00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:35.719
<i>and protect FIRST City.</i>

147
00:10:35.719 --> 00:10:37.846
<i>Through the power of collaboration.</i>

148
00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:41.349
<i>you will bring hope and strengthen
the force that binds us all.</i>

149
00:10:41.433 --> 00:10:43.935
<i>so that together we rise.</i>

150
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.820
In their eyes.
you see simultaneously two things:

151
00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:56.948
excitement and terror.

152
00:10:57.032 --> 00:10:59.993
because they're thinking.
"Where do I start?"

153
00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:02.370
This is gonna be hard.

154
00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:07.959
Just as we change the game every year.

155
00:11:08.043 --> 00:11:10.920
we change what's in the kit every year.

156
00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:15.842
And sometimes the kids will ask.
"Where are the assembly instructions?"

157
00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:17.218
"There are no instructions!

158
00:11:17.302 --> 00:11:18.928
We don't even know
what you're gonna build."

159
00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:21.264
What is this over here?

160
00:11:21.765 --> 00:11:22.766
That's a good question.

161
00:11:22.766 --> 00:11:24.893
- That's what I'm trying to figure out.
- You see the lights?

162
00:11:24.893 --> 00:11:26.144
Typically. by the way.

163
00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:31.191
the kids come up with
more ingenious ways to state the problem.

164
00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:34.235
It's gonna go over the bar. hook under.
and then the pulley is gonna have--

165
00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:36.863
be hooked up to a motor
and be able to move around the bar.

166
00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:40.950
So you have just one robot on there.
and it's level. you'll get 15 points.

167
00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:42.660
As Einstein said.

168
00:11:42.744 --> 00:11:45.246
"Imagination
is more important than knowledge."

169
00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:49.584
The kids have the imagination
to come up with a really neat way

170
00:11:49.584 --> 00:11:51.586
that we can solve this problem.

171
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:56.549
But they don't have the knowledge
that can take the engineering tools

172
00:11:56.633 --> 00:11:58.885
and turn
this great imagination into reality.

173
00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:01.054
That's where the mentors come in.

174
00:12:02.097 --> 00:12:06.393
The kids have the enthusiasm
to try some really big idea.

175
00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:10.230
and the mentors have a way to figure out
how to implement it.

176
00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:16.528
It's gonna take the whole day
for the teams to understand.

177
00:12:16.528 --> 00:12:19.155
"How do you play this game?
How do you get the most points?

178
00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:20.824
How do you work with each other?"

179
00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:23.201
In the game reveal.

180
00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:26.705
we saw that there's a bunch of
different elements we have to deal with.

181
00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:31.835
The game is played
Red Alliance versus Blue Alliance.

182
00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:35.171
Each alliance is made up of three teams.

183
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.844
The goal is to score more points
than the other alliance.

184
00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:45.890
You score points by shooting yellow
foam balls. also known as Power Cells.

185
00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:47.517
into the goals.

186
00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:52.689
You get more points for the higher goals
and fewer points for the lower goals.

187
00:12:53.815 --> 00:12:55.025
At the end of the game.

188
00:12:55.025 --> 00:12:57.986
your robot can score additional points
by climbing the Seesaw.

189
00:12:58.945 --> 00:13:02.282
also known as the Shield Generator switch.
and hanging.

190
00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:07.871
If you balance the Seesaw. making it
level. your alliance scores extra points.

191
00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:11.374
No part of the robot can touch the ground.

192
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.340
I'm feeling kind of relieved
now that I know what's going on.

193
00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.008
but now it's a little daunting.

194
00:13:22.177 --> 00:13:24.429
Now it's time to put the field together.

195
00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:27.432
We're trying to make sure that we have
a field that represents the game

196
00:13:27.432 --> 00:13:28.725
as much as possible.

197
00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:30.894
We're gonna start a game simulation.

198
00:13:30.894 --> 00:13:33.438
and we're gonna try to act out
what we would do.

199
00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:36.566
So. there's gonna be
six rolling chairs. six students.

200
00:13:36.566 --> 00:13:39.694
Um. one on each chair.
You guys are the robots.

201
00:13:39.778 --> 00:13:41.237
The point of the simulation

202
00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:44.032
is to kind of understand how the robots
will interact with the field.

203
00:13:44.032 --> 00:13:46.242
- Anyone interested in being a robot?
- I want to be a robot.

204
00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:47.702
- I want to be a robot.
- Kayleigh.

205
00:13:47.786 --> 00:13:51.498
Garret. Connor. Jacob. Lyle.

206
00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:56.002
Now we're on this side.

207
00:13:56.086 --> 00:13:57.545
All right. good.

208
00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:04.469
Ow. my legs!

209
00:14:05.095 --> 00:14:06.096
Got one in.

210
00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:13.353
Yeah!

211
00:14:19.776 --> 00:14:22.487
What are the present--
Go over the agenda for today maybe.

212
00:14:22.487 --> 00:14:24.030
So everyone's on the same page.

213
00:14:24.114 --> 00:14:26.199
We had already picked up
our kit of parts.

214
00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:28.660
I feel like we just need
to do inventory soon.

215
00:14:29.244 --> 00:14:33.039
Design team needs to take lead
of the designing of the robot.

216
00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:37.836
I got to know FIRST
through. actually. my husband

217
00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:39.879
who. you know. when I married him...

218
00:14:39.963 --> 00:14:42.674
A year or two in our marriage. he's like.
"There's this thing called FIRST."

219
00:14:42.674 --> 00:14:46.886
He would leave me for weekends at a time
and be gone to this thing.

220
00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:48.138
I was like. "Okay."

221
00:14:48.138 --> 00:14:51.558
Like. he's really dedicated to service
and I love that about him. right?

222
00:14:51.558 --> 00:14:53.476
And I had no idea it was actually "cool."

223
00:14:55.228 --> 00:14:58.189
What really got me hooked was
when I went to their first competition.

224
00:14:58.273 --> 00:15:01.151
I saw. like. mascots.
I saw music. I saw people dancing.

225
00:15:01.151 --> 00:15:03.028
I saw parents there.

226
00:15:03.028 --> 00:15:05.238
It was. like. a stadium of excited people.

227
00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:07.907
I'm like. "This is a hidden treasure
that no one knows about.

228
00:15:07.991 --> 00:15:08.992
This is so cool."

229
00:15:12.412 --> 00:15:14.497
I knew that I got bit by the FIRST bug.

230
00:15:14.581 --> 00:15:17.250
It was that competition
that got it for me.

231
00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.752
I'm a science teacher at my school.

232
00:15:18.752 --> 00:15:20.962
so that's why I decided
to start the TeraWatts.

233
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.592
I'm a little competitive.

234
00:15:25.592 --> 00:15:26.760
Just a little bit.

235
00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:28.803
For the first two years.

236
00:15:28.887 --> 00:15:32.015
my husband purposely didn't want to
sign us up for the same competition.

237
00:15:32.015 --> 00:15:34.392
He would always say.
"That didn't work out with our schedule."

238
00:15:34.476 --> 00:15:36.686
I'm like. "I secretly know."

239
00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.356
But it's not him that's making me
competitive at all.

240
00:15:39.356 --> 00:15:41.524
It's just. like. my own competitiveness.

241
00:15:41.608 --> 00:15:42.901
But he does so much to help.

242
00:15:42.901 --> 00:15:46.154
- It helps that I am not competitive.
- Yeah. we're opposites.

243
00:15:50.075 --> 00:15:51.076
Whoo!

244
00:16:13.682 --> 00:16:17.644
If you go to. like. LA Regional
and you read the game manual.

245
00:16:17.644 --> 00:16:20.730
it tells you. like.
list of stuff you need for inspection.

246
00:16:20.814 --> 00:16:23.066
So. one thing that you guys
are gonna work on this weekend

247
00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:24.651
is the bill of materials.

248
00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:26.820
It's like the inventory.

249
00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.447
You make a list of everything
that's on the robot.

250
00:16:29.531 --> 00:16:32.826
Mm-hmm.
And so there's a template I uploaded...

251
00:16:32.826 --> 00:16:36.830
So our team's about 15 kids.
We have about three to four mentors.

252
00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:41.501
So it's a smaller school
in a low-income neighborhood in Watts.

253
00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:44.045
This thing can slide and it could snap.
and we don't want that.

254
00:16:44.129 --> 00:16:45.880
- We definitely don't want that.
- Probably...

255
00:16:45.964 --> 00:16:47.924
We actually don't even have
a room to work in.

256
00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:49.801
We work in a hallway.

257
00:16:51.261 --> 00:16:54.681
Our team. in particular.
doesn't have a lot of funding.

258
00:16:55.598 --> 00:16:57.642
But the past two seasons
we've had pretty good robots

259
00:16:57.726 --> 00:17:00.770
that have worked and played the game
using our tools.

260
00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:03.857
So. I think it's great to show
that we don't need. you know.

261
00:17:03.857 --> 00:17:07.027
fancy-schmancy equipment
to be able to have a working robot.

262
00:17:07.027 --> 00:17:09.237
You're gonna have to take it off.
You wanna take this piece off.

263
00:17:09.237 --> 00:17:10.321
- There it is.
- Yeah.

264
00:17:10.405 --> 00:17:13.950
We'll take it off. put a washer. so...
'Cause it looks like it's not durable.

265
00:17:14.034 --> 00:17:15.118
Take out the arms.

266
00:17:15.118 --> 00:17:18.246
What FIRST does is that
it doesn't tell kids what to do

267
00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:19.539
or show them how to do it.

268
00:17:19.539 --> 00:17:20.874
They have to figure it out.

269
00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:23.752
There's a problem.
There's roadblocks. like real life.

270
00:17:24.419 --> 00:17:27.255
And it was hard in the beginning
when we first started this team.

271
00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:29.716
I had to tell them.
"I know this is not like school.

272
00:17:29.716 --> 00:17:31.801
Because you're used to
having a worksheet."

273
00:17:32.594 --> 00:17:34.346
So that's when I see
the lightbulb going off.

274
00:17:34.346 --> 00:17:36.348
when they realize
it's a different type of learning.

275
00:17:36.348 --> 00:17:40.852
We figured out that the shooter actually
fits in here without it obstructing this.

276
00:17:40.852 --> 00:17:43.897
So what we're gonna do is
we're gonna bring these closer together.

277
00:17:44.439 --> 00:17:48.151
So they could actually go up. like.
without any obstruction.

278
00:17:48.151 --> 00:17:50.153
Did you guys figure out
how to mount it on here?

279
00:17:50.153 --> 00:17:53.198
- 'Cause that was the other question I had.
- We need to put in--

280
00:17:53.198 --> 00:17:55.658
- How it's gonna travel up there.
- Look. That's the shooter.

281
00:17:55.742 --> 00:17:59.120
It's not how it looks in
the thing. but. you know. problem-solving.

282
00:17:59.204 --> 00:18:01.373
That's why kids stay.
Because it's something that--

283
00:18:01.373 --> 00:18:03.208
It annoys them.
but it keeps them coming back.

284
00:18:03.208 --> 00:18:07.462
'Cause they're like. "This is frustrating.
but we need to figure it out." you know?

285
00:18:07.462 --> 00:18:09.381
Now. we got all our motors working.

286
00:18:09.923 --> 00:18:11.383
It can't go forward or back.

287
00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:13.927
All it does is basically just spin.

288
00:18:14.803 --> 00:18:17.639
The pros of having a small team
is everyone knows each other.

289
00:18:17.639 --> 00:18:18.973
and you form that bond.

290
00:18:19.057 --> 00:18:21.726
The con. though. is that. unfortunately.
we don't have the hands.

291
00:18:22.394 --> 00:18:23.812
That's left. And that's right.

292
00:18:23.812 --> 00:18:26.856
Aaron is the one kid that knows
everything about every part of the robot.

293
00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.858
It's like the gears
are fighting each other.

294
00:18:28.942 --> 00:18:31.861
'Cause he's so passionate.
wherever help is needed. like. he'll go.

295
00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:34.072
But he does everything.

296
00:18:34.072 --> 00:18:39.035
Wiring. Coding. Building.
Aaron does all that.

297
00:18:39.536 --> 00:18:41.871
- Did you misunderstand the problem?
- Not really.

298
00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:50.380
Some people. they're afraid of change.

299
00:18:51.047 --> 00:18:53.049
I'm not really that kind of person.

300
00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:56.886
Because you don't know what you like
or what your passion is

301
00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:58.638
until you try new things.

302
00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:03.059
Before I joined the team.
I played football.

303
00:19:03.143 --> 00:19:06.021
I played basketball.
And I was interested in anime.

304
00:19:07.689 --> 00:19:10.650
At first. I learned about coding
back in sixth grade.

305
00:19:10.734 --> 00:19:12.736
but I didn't really connect with it.

306
00:19:12.736 --> 00:19:14.696
So I didn't really like it that much.

307
00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:24.914
As a kid.
Aaron was kinda like in his shell.

308
00:19:24.998 --> 00:19:29.127
He was really just to himself.

309
00:19:29.127 --> 00:19:32.505
He really never bothered nobody.
He was just to himself.

310
00:19:33.381 --> 00:19:34.799
Before he got into robotics.

311
00:19:34.883 --> 00:19:38.094
he was kinda like
holding his feelings on the inside.

312
00:19:38.178 --> 00:19:40.180
But now. he's opening up more.

313
00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:44.184
Looks like they in little go-karts.

314
00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:46.978
I seen their robot.
They have a suction cup on the bottom.

315
00:19:47.062 --> 00:19:48.646
- Oh.
- So it can just pull itself up.

316
00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:49.981
Wow.

317
00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:52.650
So one day at school.

318
00:19:52.734 --> 00:19:53.860
I look over and I--

319
00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.029
All I see is a...
I'm like. "What is that?"

320
00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:59.366
So. at first. I'm like.
"Hey. That's a nice robot."

321
00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:02.243
And I'm like. "Can I drive it?"
He goes. "Well. no. you cannot."

322
00:20:02.994 --> 00:20:04.913
And then he told me about
the robotics program.

323
00:20:04.913 --> 00:20:07.499
When I showed up after school.
I realized why he didn't let me drive it.

324
00:20:07.499 --> 00:20:11.252
Because I started to drive it.
It was hard to control.

325
00:20:11.753 --> 00:20:13.797
So then I joined the team after that.

326
00:20:14.798 --> 00:20:19.052
Something was just sparked
that he loved about it. and he kept going.

327
00:20:19.052 --> 00:20:21.930
I mean. getting up at 6:30 in the morning.
telling me. "I'm gone!"

328
00:20:22.639 --> 00:20:24.099
"Wait. hold on. On a Saturday?"

329
00:20:24.808 --> 00:20:26.893
- Wow.
- Look how it do get back in its seat.

330
00:20:26.893 --> 00:20:28.144
Uh-huh.

331
00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:31.272
<i>Oh! High Rollers' hook fell off.</i>

332
00:20:31.356 --> 00:20:32.357
Let me drive it.

333
00:20:33.483 --> 00:20:36.778
One day. he was showing me
how he was putting a robot together.

334
00:20:36.778 --> 00:20:38.655
I was like. "How you do it that fast?"

335
00:20:38.655 --> 00:20:42.409
And he goes. like. he said.
"Mama. it's all in the skills.

336
00:20:42.409 --> 00:20:43.993
It's all in the skills."

337
00:20:51.126 --> 00:20:52.502
I like coding a lot

338
00:20:52.502 --> 00:20:54.671
because you're the one
who's in charge. basically.

339
00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:58.091
And people. if they don't understand it.
they have to come to you.

340
00:20:59.009 --> 00:21:02.470
But building robots is hard to figure out.

341
00:21:02.554 --> 00:21:04.180
What code are you running?

342
00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:07.308
We're running 6904 Code 2020.

343
00:21:07.392 --> 00:21:09.894
- Does it have autonomous in it?
- No. it does not.

344
00:21:10.395 --> 00:21:14.190
And just getting that code to work
took about an hour-- hour and a half.

345
00:21:14.816 --> 00:21:18.278
I actually like it because if it doesn't
go right the first time.

346
00:21:18.278 --> 00:21:22.323
just keep trying and trying again
until you actually. like. get it right.

347
00:21:38.006 --> 00:21:41.259
Right now. I go to college
in St. Paul. Minnesota.

348
00:21:41.343 --> 00:21:45.013
But I usually come back to Japan
during summer and winter

349
00:21:45.764 --> 00:21:49.100
'cause I'm mentoring a robotics team here.

350
00:21:51.394 --> 00:21:55.523
I'm a double major in Neuroscience
and Psychology.

351
00:21:55.607 --> 00:21:58.610
and I've been thinking to minor in Dance.

352
00:21:59.277 --> 00:22:04.199
I think. probably. dancing ballet
is the fun thing I do.

353
00:22:05.283 --> 00:22:09.412
In addition to that.
I'm also part of a rocketry team.

354
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.457
so it's keeping me very busy.

355
00:22:17.545 --> 00:22:19.214
When I was in ninth grade.

356
00:22:19.214 --> 00:22:24.219
I applied to a high school exchange
program in Minneapolis.

357
00:22:24.219 --> 00:22:29.432
And I got to participate
in a FIRST Team called 2500 Herobotics.

358
00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:33.228
Before I joined them.

359
00:22:33.228 --> 00:22:37.065
I never expected that I was gonna be
interested in engineering.

360
00:22:38.024 --> 00:22:41.319
But the FIRST regional inspired me a lot.

361
00:22:42.112 --> 00:22:44.489
They were just so passionate about
what they were doing.

362
00:22:46.282 --> 00:22:48.159
In Japan. most high schoolers

363
00:22:48.243 --> 00:22:52.455
don't have the opportunities
to learn about engineering in-depth.

364
00:22:53.123 --> 00:22:56.292
So. it was an amazing experience for me.

365
00:22:59.045 --> 00:23:00.755
I got so determined.

366
00:23:00.839 --> 00:23:03.925
I decided that I want to start
a team in Japan.

367
00:23:04.718 --> 00:23:08.430
I wanted to help make it
accessible to everyone.

368
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:14.102
So. I sent an e-mail to Chiba
Institute of Technology asking for help.

369
00:23:14.602 --> 00:23:17.105
And surprisingly.
they said yes.

370
00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:46.092
We're a community-based team.

371
00:23:46.176 --> 00:23:49.679
It's not like we have
a school as a workspace.

372
00:23:51.598 --> 00:23:55.518
Dr. Tomiyama was willing to give up
one of his rooms

373
00:23:56.144 --> 00:23:58.730
so that we can actually have a workspace.

374
00:24:03.902 --> 00:24:07.739
In Japan.
FIRST Robotics Competition is unknown.

375
00:24:08.406 --> 00:24:10.325
When Kanon started this team.

376
00:24:10.325 --> 00:24:13.578
there were only three teams
in the whole entire Japan.

377
00:24:13.578 --> 00:24:15.455
So we decided to help her.

378
00:24:16.122 --> 00:24:17.123
When she started.

379
00:24:17.207 --> 00:24:19.959
she didn't have enough members
to create a team.

380
00:24:20.585 --> 00:24:22.420
so she went to her friends.

381
00:24:22.504 --> 00:24:25.757
and then community
and whoever she can talk to.

382
00:24:26.424 --> 00:24:29.469
Once she decided to do something.
she would do it.

383
00:24:32.764 --> 00:24:37.310
One of the reasons I never
expected to be interested in engineering

384
00:24:37.394 --> 00:24:41.439
is that I'd never seen a female engineer.

385
00:24:42.273 --> 00:24:43.983
So. I didn't think that. like.

386
00:24:44.067 --> 00:24:47.946
a girl like me can
actually succeed in the field.

387
00:24:49.072 --> 00:24:51.074
I think that's kind of ridiculous.

388
00:24:51.074 --> 00:24:55.036
but that's actually what happens
with many girls.

389
00:24:56.913 --> 00:25:00.208
Right now. both team captains are girls.

390
00:25:01.209 --> 00:25:05.088
in addition to Noi.
who is engineering captain on the team.

391
00:26:00.435 --> 00:26:03.938
We are trying to shoot the ball
to that goal right now.

392
00:26:04.981 --> 00:26:07.192
But first. we have to be able to
intake the ball.

393
00:26:07.192 --> 00:26:08.651
so we are trying to do that.

394
00:26:09.861 --> 00:26:12.280
We don't have any time.
so it's quite hard.

395
00:27:23.309 --> 00:27:25.854
In order to build the perfect robot.

396
00:27:25.854 --> 00:27:32.902
Noi comes to the workshop every day
from 5:00 a.m. until sometimes 11:00 p.m.

397
00:27:33.862 --> 00:27:37.073
She also comes from a different city.

398
00:27:37.157 --> 00:27:40.076
By train. it'll take two hours.

399
00:27:52.213 --> 00:27:53.256
For some teams.

400
00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:58.928
their robots do only one
or maybe two tasks and not all of them.

401
00:27:59.429 --> 00:28:01.514
But she wants to do all of them.

402
00:28:02.599 --> 00:28:04.100
They only have six weeks.

403
00:28:04.851 --> 00:28:08.188
so they tend to make mistakes
because they are in a hurry.

404
00:28:12.442 --> 00:28:15.695
I'm not sure whether
they are going to be successful or not.

405
00:28:15.779 --> 00:28:16.863
but they will try.

406
00:28:24.245 --> 00:28:26.831
One of the great things about FIRST

407
00:28:26.915 --> 00:28:29.167
is you need
absolutely no technical background

408
00:28:29.167 --> 00:28:31.920
to have a great time
and a great experience.

409
00:28:32.754 --> 00:28:36.007
There are many different areas
that kids can get involved in.

410
00:28:36.966 --> 00:28:39.803
We believe that helping each other matters

411
00:28:39.803 --> 00:28:43.181
just as much
as technical competence matters.

412
00:28:44.349 --> 00:28:48.520
Most teams have
a whole group of kids whose entire job.

413
00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.897
not just during our season.
but throughout the year.

414
00:28:51.481 --> 00:28:55.318
is to promote the values of FIRST
through their community.

415
00:28:55.402 --> 00:28:57.737
And we call that the Chairman's Team.

416
00:29:04.494 --> 00:29:07.997
Our team has completed
over 2.000 hours of community service

417
00:29:08.081 --> 00:29:12.627
and has spread awareness to over
30.000 students in the past year itself.

418
00:29:13.211 --> 00:29:17.507
We want to make it commonplace for
girls everywhere to participate in STEM.

419
00:29:17.507 --> 00:29:20.593
This is why we created the book
#girlsLOVErobots.

420
00:29:20.677 --> 00:29:24.556
We hope to inspire girls from all over
and show the world...

421
00:29:24.556 --> 00:29:26.266
Girls love robots!

422
00:29:28.685 --> 00:29:30.311
At the end of a season.

423
00:29:30.395 --> 00:29:35.483
we give out the Chairman's Award to a team
that has done something extraordinary.

424
00:29:35.567 --> 00:29:39.154
Let's congratulate Team 195.

425
00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:43.616
We want all the kids
on FIRST teams to see themselves

426
00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:48.329
as a powerful network where everybody's
looking out for each other.

427
00:30:20.403 --> 00:30:23.907
Six weeks just up to your FIRST regional.

428
00:30:23.907 --> 00:30:28.119
it's just barely enough time
to build a real machine

429
00:30:28.203 --> 00:30:29.704
that can fulfill the challenge.

430
00:30:40.799 --> 00:30:41.925
As a coach.

431
00:30:41.925 --> 00:30:44.928
at the same time that you're building
the machine with the students.

432
00:30:44.928 --> 00:30:49.182
you also need to take care of everything
else that the competition cares about.

433
00:30:49.683 --> 00:30:52.143
Because FIRST is not only about the robot.

434
00:30:53.061 --> 00:30:56.523
We are focusing a lot of our attention
on the Chairman's Team.

435
00:30:57.065 --> 00:31:01.528
Presenting Chairman's each year
is very. very important for our team.

436
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:19.754
We are working on
a Chairman's speech

437
00:31:19.838 --> 00:31:23.591
that we are presenting
at the regional in Sacramento.

438
00:31:41.568 --> 00:31:45.447
We have short amount of time.
so it's really hard.

439
00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:33.495
Wow.

440
00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:56.101
Ah!

441
00:32:59.104 --> 00:33:02.065
For me to open up. it has been so hard.

442
00:33:03.108 --> 00:33:06.653
The little. like. let's say the thorn
that I have here is. like.

443
00:33:06.653 --> 00:33:08.738
you have just to get it all out.

444
00:33:10.281 --> 00:33:14.202
And now that I'm on the Chairman's Team.
I have to show who I really am.

445
00:34:01.916 --> 00:34:06.838
A long. long time ago.
a space of matter from this...

446
00:34:08.006 --> 00:34:09.507
Okay. Again.

447
00:34:11.134 --> 00:34:12.886
A long. long time ago...

448
00:34:19.184 --> 00:34:23.772
Have you ever felt like
you are in a deep hole. where...

449
00:34:26.274 --> 00:34:27.484
Have you ever felt--

450
00:34:27.484 --> 00:34:31.404
So. have you ever felt like
you are in a very deep hole?

451
00:34:42.791 --> 00:34:47.337
We are the team Nautilus 4010.
and we're here to talk about us.

452
00:34:49.964 --> 00:34:51.257
Again.

453
00:34:55.178 --> 00:34:57.430
"...you have to do the auditions."

454
00:35:17.742 --> 00:35:21.246
This year.
I'm going to graduate from high school.

455
00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:36.803
<i>Stop the time right now and begin ♪</i>

456
00:36:42.786 --> 00:36:43.787
Cutting!

457
00:36:54.923 --> 00:36:57.050
We've been a team for several years.

458
00:36:57.050 --> 00:37:00.553
so we've been able to accumulate
a lot of tools. a lot of equipment...

459
00:37:06.101 --> 00:37:08.770
So it's really good to have
a lot of capability available

460
00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:10.522
so you can quickly prototype something.

461
00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:16.444
This year. we inducted
68 people into our team.

462
00:37:16.528 --> 00:37:18.863
so it's the largest team
that we've had so far.

463
00:37:18.947 --> 00:37:20.240
Uh. kind of crazy.

464
00:37:21.491 --> 00:37:23.118
Last year. we won Championships.

465
00:37:23.118 --> 00:37:24.452
And this year.

466
00:37:25.245 --> 00:37:28.164
I think we're
not going to make it that far.

467
00:37:28.248 --> 00:37:33.503
It's week three and we're really behind
on creating the robot.

468
00:37:34.004 --> 00:37:38.550
We have lots of issues.
We're not good at organizing.

469
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:43.054
We incorrectly label things.
Some wires go to the wrong places.

470
00:37:43.555 --> 00:37:47.892
But. yeah. the robot is not great.

471
00:37:51.771 --> 00:37:54.816
Right now. we're replacing the wheels
on the drive chain.

472
00:37:55.358 --> 00:37:58.236
uh. because we also--
we tipped it over twice during testing.

473
00:37:59.237 --> 00:38:01.573
In the past few weeks.
we've been testing code

474
00:38:01.573 --> 00:38:03.908
and making modifications
to make everything work.

475
00:38:11.332 --> 00:38:13.585
When you remove something.
a bunch of errors pop up everywhere.

476
00:38:14.294 --> 00:38:15.378
Once you delete something.

477
00:38:15.462 --> 00:38:19.424
you have to remove a bunch of other stuff
to make the code work.

478
00:38:25.388 --> 00:38:28.058
Well. we're having some issues
with the battery wire

479
00:38:28.058 --> 00:38:29.642
and we're trying to fix it right now.

480
00:38:29.726 --> 00:38:31.895
Um. so yeah.
Let's hope that it gets fixed.

481
00:38:35.148 --> 00:38:37.692
- I set it right there.
- This is what really matters.

482
00:38:37.776 --> 00:38:39.527
- We can still--
- So then let's talk about auto...

483
00:38:39.611 --> 00:38:40.612
'Cause-- If we--

484
00:38:40.612 --> 00:38:42.322
That's not what he's trying to talk about.

485
00:38:43.281 --> 00:38:45.450
It's really stressful. actually.

486
00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:48.370
We never tested
the control panel mechanism

487
00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:51.539
because it was the lowest priority. and--

488
00:38:54.751 --> 00:38:55.752
Uh...

489
00:39:02.717 --> 00:39:05.095
Sports has an enormous power

490
00:39:05.095 --> 00:39:07.806
to direct the time and energy
and passion of kids

491
00:39:07.806 --> 00:39:10.141
to develop skills in a certain way.

492
00:39:11.017 --> 00:39:13.687
Once I knew
that I was gonna build this sport.

493
00:39:13.687 --> 00:39:17.065
I wasn't gonna try to figure out
which parts I would take.

494
00:39:17.065 --> 00:39:18.149
I wanted it all.

495
00:39:18.775 --> 00:39:21.486
Everything that other sports do.
we're gonna do.

496
00:39:21.486 --> 00:39:24.739
I told the teams.
"You better have a mascot.

497
00:39:24.823 --> 00:39:26.074
You better name your robot."

498
00:39:27.367 --> 00:39:32.080
If football needs a halftime show.
FIRST Championship needs a halftime show.

499
00:39:33.164 --> 00:39:35.041
We're gonna give out letters.

500
00:39:35.125 --> 00:39:36.960
We're gonna have
a double-elimination tournament.

501
00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.753
We're gonna have a championship.

502
00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:44.009
I wanted to make sure we had it all.

503
00:39:45.844 --> 00:39:47.303
So we invented the game.

504
00:39:47.387 --> 00:39:50.974
but we wanna use everything else
that our culture has prepared for us.

505
00:39:57.022 --> 00:39:58.398
Oh. wait. The light turned off.

506
00:39:58.398 --> 00:40:00.442
The name of the robot is pretty important

507
00:40:00.442 --> 00:40:02.485
for the announcer during the competition.

508
00:40:03.153 --> 00:40:07.699
But the names they choose on our team.
I don't really agree with them.

509
00:40:07.699 --> 00:40:10.452
- - So the name is Beep-Boop-
- Beep-
- Boop.

510
00:40:10.452 --> 00:40:12.495
- - We are not having no "Beep-
- Boop-
- Bop."

511
00:40:12.579 --> 00:40:14.247
- - -We're not having "Beep-
- Boop-
- Bop."
- Why not?

512
00:40:14.247 --> 00:40:16.666
- Because it doesn't flow.
- That's not right.

513
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:19.669
- - Beep-Boop-Bop. Beep-
- Boop-
- Bop.
- That's not how it works. No. No.

514
00:40:19.753 --> 00:40:20.920
- - Samantha. Beep-
- Boop-
- Bop?

515
00:40:21.004 --> 00:40:25.216
This is an important matter.
It's like naming your child.

516
00:40:25.842 --> 00:40:27.594
- - Who names their child "Beep-
- Boop-
- Bop"?

517
00:40:28.845 --> 00:40:31.556
She said it sounds like "Betty Boop."
Let's just call it Betty Boop.

518
00:40:31.556 --> 00:40:34.392
- I refuse-- No.
- Okay. how about we'll have a vote?

519
00:40:34.476 --> 00:40:38.271
But everyone's response will have to be
submitted by 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

520
00:40:38.355 --> 00:40:40.482
- - Aaron. "Beep-
- Boop-
- Bop"
- - or "Beep-Boop-
- Beep-
- Boop"?

521
00:40:40.482 --> 00:40:42.525
- We are settled.
- - -"Beep-Boop-
- Beep-
- Boop."

522
00:40:45.028 --> 00:40:46.071
I will have...

523
00:40:46.071 --> 00:40:48.156
- I prefer "WALL-E."
- It's over with.

524
00:40:48.156 --> 00:40:49.783
- - Just saying Beep-Boop-
- Beep-
- Boop--

525
00:40:49.783 --> 00:40:51.034
Just say Lil' Beep.

526
00:40:51.034 --> 00:40:52.869
Lil' Beep.

527
00:40:53.536 --> 00:40:54.537
We're a sport.

528
00:40:54.621 --> 00:40:58.124
We're like every other sport.
except for one major difference.

529
00:40:58.208 --> 00:41:00.710
We don't win at any cost.
We're a "Coopertition."

530
00:41:01.628 --> 00:41:04.047
It's never one team against another.

531
00:41:05.173 --> 00:41:06.424
We asked the question.

532
00:41:06.508 --> 00:41:09.094
"How do you deal with that dynamic range

533
00:41:09.094 --> 00:41:11.721
of a team that has
nearly unlimited resources

534
00:41:11.805 --> 00:41:15.433
playing against a team whose school
has very limited resources?"

535
00:41:15.517 --> 00:41:19.688
So we tried really. really hard
to level the playing field.

536
00:41:19.688 --> 00:41:21.940
We put teams in alliances.

537
00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:25.151
Alliance Two would like to pick 3858.

538
00:41:26.945 --> 00:41:31.074
It shows that if you can
communicate and cooperate and coordinate

539
00:41:31.074 --> 00:41:33.201
and divide your skill sets.

540
00:41:33.201 --> 00:41:35.954
and make your skill sets available
to other teams.

541
00:41:35.954 --> 00:41:37.872
then you have a happy outcome.

542
00:41:40.542 --> 00:41:42.752
What do you think's
gonna take it to win this?

543
00:41:42.836 --> 00:41:43.837
To win in this field.

544
00:41:43.837 --> 00:41:45.922
I think you're going to need to build
a perfect alliance.

545
00:41:46.006 --> 00:41:47.382
Anyone will if they want to win it.

546
00:41:47.382 --> 00:41:48.466
This is it.

547
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:52.053
This is the moment that you guys
have been working so hard for.

548
00:41:52.137 --> 00:41:55.557
"Coopertition" is a combination
of cooperation and competition.

549
00:41:55.557 --> 00:41:58.309
It's truly a unique aspect of FIRST

550
00:41:58.393 --> 00:42:01.730
because it teaches kids
how to cooperate and compete

551
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:05.442
at exactly the same time in a world
where that usually doesn't happen.

552
00:42:08.028 --> 00:42:11.614
You're in an alliance. right?
It's not just "may the best robot win."

553
00:42:11.698 --> 00:42:13.491
It's "may the best alliance win."

554
00:42:13.575 --> 00:42:16.202
So if you are a small team.
if you're a new team.

555
00:42:16.286 --> 00:42:18.121
you can be really good at one thing

556
00:42:18.121 --> 00:42:21.374
and you can actually be quite competitive
in a competition.

557
00:42:21.458 --> 00:42:23.668
You know. sometimes
it's better to have a robot

558
00:42:23.752 --> 00:42:27.005
that can do one thing
that's really important really well.

559
00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:34.220
And so. in our team.
when you don't have a lot of members.

560
00:42:34.304 --> 00:42:37.724
trying to make a robot that can do
three different things and do it well

561
00:42:37.724 --> 00:42:39.059
becomes almost impossible.

562
00:42:39.059 --> 00:42:41.478
So it's not a strategically good choice
to do that.

563
00:42:42.187 --> 00:42:45.106
We chose to focus
on the climbing mechanism.

564
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:46.441
If we could get it to work.

565
00:42:46.441 --> 00:42:50.028
this gives us a much better shot
of being a competitive robot

566
00:42:50.028 --> 00:42:51.738
and being picked by an alliance.

567
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:57.118
Our team has been so lucky
because we can go to 4201

568
00:42:57.202 --> 00:42:59.329
and use tools that we don't have.

569
00:43:00.622 --> 00:43:03.708
We love to invite the TeraWatts
or any other team who wants to come by

570
00:43:03.792 --> 00:43:07.212
and join us as we're all trying to learn
and trying to figure it out.

571
00:43:08.171 --> 00:43:10.256
I just want everyone to know
this about my husband.

572
00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:13.718
He's the best husband. and every woman
should find a partner like this.

573
00:43:14.594 --> 00:43:16.971
He does so much
because he's helping two teams.

574
00:43:19.057 --> 00:43:20.684
Up we go.

575
00:43:20.684 --> 00:43:24.187
When we come here.
it's a game-changer for teams like ours.

576
00:43:24.187 --> 00:43:26.398
There are kids helping us.
We have their mentors.

577
00:43:26.898 --> 00:43:28.983
The kids see other teams.
They're inspired.

578
00:43:29.067 --> 00:43:31.444
They're motivated to finish their robot.
They don't feel alone.

579
00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:35.198
Especially for our girls
to be able to see other girls.

580
00:43:35.198 --> 00:43:38.034
I'm hoping that'll inspire them
to use their voice.

581
00:43:42.247 --> 00:43:44.874
What I think is beautiful
is that privilege isn't a bad thing.

582
00:43:44.958 --> 00:43:47.210
It's only a bad thing if you don't
help others with what you have.

583
00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:48.837
They're the perfect example of that.

584
00:43:50.422 --> 00:43:52.757
When you're in a team together.
when you're working together.

585
00:43:52.841 --> 00:43:54.801
you're trying to help each other out.

586
00:43:54.801 --> 00:43:56.761
There's an end goal
that we're trying to reach.

587
00:43:56.845 --> 00:44:00.015
But the key is gracious professionalism
because you don't want to burn a bridge.

588
00:44:00.015 --> 00:44:02.726
You don't know if that person
that you're working with and talking to

589
00:44:02.726 --> 00:44:05.145
is somebody that you're gonna need
three months down the line.

590
00:44:05.145 --> 00:44:06.229
six months down the line.

591
00:44:07.564 --> 00:44:10.108
We need to encourage
more teams to give back.

592
00:44:10.108 --> 00:44:12.318
Whether you're from a low-income community
or high-income--

593
00:44:12.402 --> 00:44:14.404
That's how the world
is gonna be a better place.

594
00:44:16.114 --> 00:44:17.490
Why are you-- Why are you not...

595
00:44:17.574 --> 00:44:19.034
Why robot not moving?

596
00:44:19.868 --> 00:44:21.661
Oh. man. Okay.

597
00:44:21.745 --> 00:44:23.496
All right. now it should.

598
00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:25.123
- Now it is.
- Look at that move!

599
00:44:25.123 --> 00:44:26.416
Hey! How's that for you?

600
00:44:28.126 --> 00:44:30.420
Getting a robot to climb is difficult.

601
00:44:32.505 --> 00:44:34.382
Oh. it slid.

602
00:44:35.175 --> 00:44:36.760
Just not really working at all.

603
00:44:37.552 --> 00:44:40.305
We need an all-white robot.
I think we could spray-paint the entire...

604
00:44:40.305 --> 00:44:43.058
I don't really know
what's going down with it.

605
00:44:44.434 --> 00:44:46.895
Lot of rambling going on in my head
and fighting with each other.

606
00:44:46.895 --> 00:44:49.064
Trying to figure out what we're gonna do.

607
00:44:49.647 --> 00:44:52.734
If we actually manage to get
a complete level climb.

608
00:44:52.734 --> 00:44:54.903
we'll score a lot of points for our team.

609
00:44:54.903 --> 00:44:57.155
And we haven't made it
that far in the competition.

610
00:44:57.155 --> 00:44:59.783
so hopefully this year
we'll do a little better.

611
00:45:02.035 --> 00:45:03.453
Oh.

612
00:45:05.497 --> 00:45:08.249
I've been working on
writing code for this.

613
00:45:08.333 --> 00:45:12.837
It's gonna make use of a sensor.
which Malcolm is hooking up now.

614
00:45:17.801 --> 00:45:19.469
We're finally working as a team.

615
00:45:19.469 --> 00:45:23.973
I had my doubts at first
as to how we would make the transition.

616
00:45:24.557 --> 00:45:26.851
But everything
is beginning to come together.

617
00:45:26.935 --> 00:45:29.104
Yeah!

618
00:45:29.688 --> 00:45:33.149
I always wondered
how Microsoft Windows exists

619
00:45:33.233 --> 00:45:35.777
because it seems
so intricate and complicated.

620
00:45:35.777 --> 00:45:39.406
It turns out it was a team effort.
Not just one person.

621
00:45:39.406 --> 00:45:42.826
Currently. we're experimenting with how
we're gonna use our double-roller design.

622
00:45:42.826 --> 00:45:45.537
We're working on
the belly pan for our new robot.

623
00:45:45.537 --> 00:45:50.208
And this is basically. all of the wires
and major modules go on here.

624
00:45:50.208 --> 00:45:53.795
...working on wire management
and also securing all the electronics.

625
00:45:54.379 --> 00:45:57.632
It's absolutely amazing to see
these kids working together.

626
00:45:58.383 --> 00:46:01.511
When you have to build a robot
in a matter of six weeks.

627
00:46:01.511 --> 00:46:05.015
it's impossible for a single student
to do that by themselves.

628
00:46:05.598 --> 00:46:08.018
And so this is when
the realization comes in

629
00:46:08.018 --> 00:46:10.979
that they cannot do everything themselves.

630
00:46:10.979 --> 00:46:14.315
They have to work with a team
to be able to do it.

631
00:46:14.399 --> 00:46:15.775
Let's go!

632
00:46:15.859 --> 00:46:19.362
I'm excited to see what our team can do.

633
00:46:24.451 --> 00:46:26.828
Very often. during the regional.
things will pop up.

634
00:46:26.828 --> 00:46:30.123
and we'll need somebody to either help
our team. another team.

635
00:46:30.123 --> 00:46:31.750
or maybe the event in general.

636
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:34.836
We are hosting the regional here.
and we wanna make sure it's successful

637
00:46:34.836 --> 00:46:38.256
and we wanna continue to host
the regionals here for years to come.

638
00:47:54.332 --> 00:47:57.627
The competition in Sacramento
is coming quickly.

639
00:48:19.107 --> 00:48:20.734
It's a lot of pressure

640
00:48:20.734 --> 00:48:23.695
because it's like the whole team
is depending on you.

641
00:48:32.370 --> 00:48:36.833
Chairman's is the most prestigious award
in the whole competition.

642
00:48:37.917 --> 00:48:41.463
So. I want the speech to be perfect.

643
00:51:01.394 --> 00:51:05.523
I think that's how Nautilus
gives something to the society.

644
00:51:06.649 --> 00:51:08.360
Believing in others

645
00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:13.406
and trying to make them understand
that the world could be a good place.

646
00:51:14.991 --> 00:51:17.786
That's the FIRST values at its most.
right?

647
00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:24.084
The kids are becoming agents of change
that this world needs

648
00:51:24.084 --> 00:51:25.960
in order to make it a better world.

649
00:52:08.044 --> 00:52:12.924
We hold this sponsor night
at the end of building season every year

650
00:52:13.008 --> 00:52:15.885
to appreciate everyone who supported us.

651
00:52:15.969 --> 00:52:19.806
especially our friends.
family and the sponsors.

652
00:52:26.688 --> 00:52:29.691
When we first started the team.

653
00:52:29.691 --> 00:52:33.111
we had so much difficulty
finding sponsors.

654
00:52:33.987 --> 00:52:35.905
In Japan. it's really unheard of

655
00:52:35.989 --> 00:52:39.451
that companies support
high school organizations.

656
00:52:40.827 --> 00:52:43.997
We don't usually have
extracurricular activities.

657
00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:50.128
It's just really important to show
that we have a finished robot.

658
00:52:50.962 --> 00:52:53.715
We just need
those resources to keep running.

659
00:52:54.883 --> 00:52:59.554
Hopefully. we'll be able to finish
everything in three hours.

660
00:53:06.227 --> 00:53:08.063
The robot is not completed yet.

661
00:53:09.022 --> 00:53:14.736
The season's not going as planned because
we were going to go to the China Regional

662
00:53:14.736 --> 00:53:17.572
but that was canceled
because of this coronavirus.

663
00:53:18.406 --> 00:53:24.371
So now they can go to the United States
to compete and they are excited for that.

664
00:53:25.497 --> 00:53:26.790
I'm sure they can do it.

665
00:54:09.916 --> 00:54:11.626
Ah.

666
00:54:39.612 --> 00:54:40.822
Ah.

667
00:55:49.015 --> 00:55:52.477
Nobody would say they are
satisfied with what they have done.

668
00:55:53.561 --> 00:55:56.398
They found out what they can do.
what they cannot do.

669
00:55:56.398 --> 00:55:59.192
And that awareness is very important.

670
00:56:01.277 --> 00:56:02.404
If you're making robots.

671
00:56:02.404 --> 00:56:04.948
you make mistakes
again and again and again

672
00:56:04.948 --> 00:56:06.741
before the robot really works.

673
00:56:08.326 --> 00:56:11.079
But with this competition
coming very fast.

674
00:56:11.788 --> 00:56:13.164
boy. that's tough.

675
00:56:15.709 --> 00:56:17.460
We had some problems.

676
00:56:18.837 --> 00:56:21.172
We definitely need to keep working.

677
00:56:21.798 --> 00:56:25.969
I hope we will have enough time to.
like. finish our robot.

678
00:56:28.013 --> 00:56:30.473
But who knows?

679
00:56:52.454 --> 00:56:57.792
Good morning. LA!

680
00:56:58.626 --> 00:57:04.049
Welcome to the 2020
FIRST Robotics Competition.

681
00:57:04.049 --> 00:57:06.384
Are you ready to rise?

682
00:57:11.806 --> 00:57:16.353
These kids work really hard
each year to build a robot.

683
00:57:16.853 --> 00:57:19.189
There is so much work to do
to design this thing.

684
00:57:19.189 --> 00:57:22.859
assemble this thing. test this thing.
learn how to drive this thing.

685
00:57:22.859 --> 00:57:25.695
and these kids deserve
their moment in the sun.

686
00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:29.783
In a regional competition.
you can win the event.

687
00:57:29.783 --> 00:57:34.996
or you can win an award. and that will
advance you to the World Championships.

688
00:57:36.664 --> 00:57:40.043
I'm excited. I've been waiting
for this day for so long.

689
00:57:41.044 --> 00:57:43.088
We were behind on a lot of stuff.

690
00:57:43.088 --> 00:57:46.758
but we pushed through
all the challenges we have.

691
00:57:46.758 --> 00:57:48.259
We got back on track.

692
00:57:49.886 --> 00:57:51.096
We made a lot of progress.

693
00:57:52.013 --> 00:57:53.181
We got the climber to work.

694
00:57:53.181 --> 00:57:55.392
so all our hard work wasn't for nothing.

695
00:57:56.476 --> 00:57:58.895
Now we're all just getting ready
for the first match.

696
00:58:02.732 --> 00:58:04.609
The way that qualification matches work

697
00:58:04.693 --> 00:58:07.112
is you're randomly placed
in an alliance of three robots

698
00:58:07.112 --> 00:58:09.114
against another random three robots.

699
00:58:09.989 --> 00:58:12.575
You might be working with
a team in one match.

700
00:58:12.659 --> 00:58:14.911
but in the next qualification match
you might be against that team.

701
00:58:14.911 --> 00:58:16.538
So it's a lot of strategizing.

702
00:58:16.538 --> 00:58:18.415
a lot of trying to get in their head
and figure out.

703
00:58:18.415 --> 00:58:20.208
"How do we work together well?"

704
00:58:21.334 --> 00:58:22.585
And then when we go to finals.

705
00:58:22.669 --> 00:58:25.630
the top eight teams
get to pick their alliance partners.

706
00:58:26.297 --> 00:58:29.134
And if your alliance wins the competition.

707
00:58:29.759 --> 00:58:32.095
all three teams
get to go to Championships.

708
00:58:32.929 --> 00:58:38.101
So our first match.
starting off with our alliance captains.

709
00:58:38.101 --> 00:58:41.813
Let's hear it for Team 4201.

710
00:58:45.734 --> 00:58:47.277
Yeah. There they are.

711
00:58:47.277 --> 00:58:51.740
Three. Two. One. Go!

712
00:58:54.034 --> 00:58:56.327
<i>Vitruvian Bots launching.</i>

713
00:58:57.162 --> 00:58:58.788
For the first 15 seconds.

714
00:58:58.872 --> 00:59:02.834
all of the robots are operating
by themselves. autonomously.

715
00:59:04.461 --> 00:59:07.130
So we only end up shooting one
and that one fails.

716
00:59:09.424 --> 00:59:13.928
Now the drivers
have taken control of the robot.

717
00:59:14.012 --> 00:59:15.597
The objective of the game

718
00:59:15.597 --> 00:59:21.353
is to score as many balls
or Power Cells into the Power Ports.

719
00:59:21.353 --> 00:59:23.313
Shooting. Shooting. Shooting.

720
00:59:23.313 --> 00:59:26.983
We get five Power Cells
into the upper port.

721
00:59:27.692 --> 00:59:28.693
Very accurate.

722
00:59:29.402 --> 00:59:31.404
We're going. Shoot. shoot. shoot.

723
00:59:32.155 --> 00:59:36.326
There are a few robots that will
try to keep us from scoring those points.

724
00:59:36.326 --> 00:59:38.495
- Oh. nice.
- Come back. Come back. Come back.

725
00:59:38.995 --> 00:59:40.455
Going back in again!

726
00:59:40.455 --> 00:59:44.376
The Red Alliance
is currently leading. and if we climb.

727
00:59:44.376 --> 00:59:46.628
we're probably going to win.

728
00:59:46.628 --> 00:59:48.421
All right. Climbing.

729
00:59:48.505 --> 00:59:50.382
<i>Red Alliance has a clear advantage.</i>

730
00:59:51.132 --> 00:59:53.426
<i>And the Vitruvian Bots continue.</i>

731
00:59:54.636 --> 00:59:55.845
<i>Here come the Vitruvian Bots.</i>

732
00:59:55.929 --> 00:59:59.599
<i>Seven seconds left. Can they do it?
They get up. Will they balance?</i>

733
00:59:59.683 --> 01:00:02.644
<i>Three. Two. One.</i>

734
01:00:04.062 --> 01:00:06.481
- <i>And at the last second...</i>
- Yes! Nice work.

735
01:00:08.066 --> 01:00:10.193
<i>That is one high-performance robot.</i>

736
01:00:11.361 --> 01:00:16.533
<i>And the Red Alliance powers up the Shield.
defending FIRST City.</i>

737
01:00:16.533 --> 01:00:18.368
I'm so proud of this match.

738
01:00:19.536 --> 01:00:24.999
The ability for a robot
to balance by itself was really key for us

739
01:00:25.083 --> 01:00:27.544
because it allowed it
to get those extra points.

740
01:00:31.172 --> 01:00:34.134
It's a lot to think about.
You guys got it. If you work as a team...

741
01:00:35.051 --> 01:00:37.679
Also if you go there early.
the other robots aren't going to be there.

742
01:00:37.679 --> 01:00:38.847
So you can line up easier.

743
01:00:38.847 --> 01:00:41.307
You're not gonna be blocked.
Your view's not going to be blocked.

744
01:00:41.391 --> 01:00:42.475
Right.

745
01:00:42.559 --> 01:00:43.601
You got this.

746
01:00:48.732 --> 01:00:49.858
Remember. Don't go too fast.

747
01:00:49.858 --> 01:00:51.776
- Not too fast. Not too slow.
- Don't go too slow.

748
01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:53.111
- All right.
- You got it.

749
01:00:53.111 --> 01:00:55.530
We've fixed up the coding.
We got everything working.

750
01:00:56.197 --> 01:00:58.199
But I'm still nervous.

751
01:00:58.283 --> 01:01:01.119
It's just like. "Is this thing gonna work?
Is it gonna mess up?"

752
01:01:01.995 --> 01:01:04.372
Just thinking about
all the possibilities that could happen.

753
01:01:04.456 --> 01:01:07.709
Let's hear it for 6904!

754
01:01:09.544 --> 01:01:12.422
Yeah. guys. you should be happy.
Enjoy this. Yeah!

755
01:01:12.422 --> 01:01:14.507
Go. TeraWatts! Whoo!

756
01:01:14.591 --> 01:01:16.426
Drivers. behind the line!

757
01:01:17.635 --> 01:01:21.389
Three. Two. One. Go!

758
01:01:22.474 --> 01:01:24.142
- <i>And right off the bat...</i>
- All right.

759
01:01:24.142 --> 01:01:26.269
Two. One...

760
01:01:27.771 --> 01:01:30.899
<i>And the Blue Alliance
comes away with the advantage.</i>

761
01:01:30.899 --> 01:01:32.901
<i>It's 35-4.</i>

762
01:01:33.902 --> 01:01:37.030
The strategy was just to
play defense against the other team.

763
01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:39.324
So basically stop
the other team from scoring.

764
01:01:39.908 --> 01:01:42.327
<i>They're just missing the upper port!</i>

765
01:01:42.327 --> 01:01:44.662
But we really need
to make sure that

766
01:01:44.746 --> 01:01:46.831
we focus on getting the robot to climb.

767
01:01:48.541 --> 01:01:51.002
Okay. You got 30 seconds. All right.

768
01:01:51.086 --> 01:01:52.712
<i>...time to activate the energy shield.</i>

769
01:01:52.796 --> 01:01:53.963
Do it.

770
01:01:54.673 --> 01:01:56.800
Calm down. Take it slow.

771
01:01:57.592 --> 01:01:59.803
You better not mess this up.
Better not mess this up.

772
01:01:59.803 --> 01:02:02.222
Are you guys ready? Can we climb?

773
01:02:02.222 --> 01:02:05.266
- Go! Go!
- Go. go. go. Go. Go. Go.

774
01:02:10.563 --> 01:02:12.232
Let's go. guys.

775
01:02:19.072 --> 01:02:21.741
Good job. Marco.
Good job. Good job too. Good job.

776
01:02:21.825 --> 01:02:24.786
I felt great. excited--
happy that it actually worked.

777
01:02:24.786 --> 01:02:27.539
- How was that?
- That was pretty good. Marco. Straight up.

778
01:02:27.539 --> 01:02:30.333
I was more or less trying to stay
in the coding zone

779
01:02:30.417 --> 01:02:31.918
so I don't get too overconfident.

780
01:02:31.918 --> 01:02:34.546
<i>One of these teams
powered up the Generator.</i>

781
01:02:34.546 --> 01:02:36.923
<i>One of these teams defended FIRST City!</i>

782
01:02:38.425 --> 01:02:40.593
We end up losing the first match.

783
01:02:41.136 --> 01:02:44.639
But if other teams see
that you have a pretty good climber.

784
01:02:44.723 --> 01:02:48.393
they'll want to choose you for an alliance
because it could help them out.

785
01:02:49.769 --> 01:02:52.439
Yeah. that's right. That was awesome.

786
01:02:52.439 --> 01:02:56.609
You went back early. You guys lined up.
You made the double climb.

787
01:02:56.693 --> 01:02:59.279
I mean. dude. what more do you want?

788
01:02:59.279 --> 01:03:01.197
I mean. maybe winning the match.
But whatever.

789
01:03:01.948 --> 01:03:05.285
This is actually the first time we have
been competing in the same event together.

790
01:03:05.285 --> 01:03:06.703
On purpose.

791
01:03:07.370 --> 01:03:11.958
He-- Yeah. he would-- Well. I--
It might ruin our marriage. so--

792
01:03:12.042 --> 01:03:14.878
Somebody's a little competitive.
I'm not gonna say who.

793
01:03:15.754 --> 01:03:19.007
Three. two. one! Go!

794
01:03:24.554 --> 01:03:25.930
Go. Red Alliance!

795
01:03:28.308 --> 01:03:29.601
Whoo!

796
01:03:29.601 --> 01:03:32.020
Hey. excuse me. Can you sit down?
I can't see my robot.

797
01:03:36.024 --> 01:03:38.234
Yeah! Whoo!

798
01:03:45.408 --> 01:03:47.952
And we're down one. We got it.
We only got four afterwards to go.

799
01:03:48.036 --> 01:03:50.163
<i>The Red Alliance takes the lead...</i>

800
01:04:01.257 --> 01:04:03.385
Yeah. we got it. We got it! Whoo!

801
01:04:04.886 --> 01:04:06.930
Love you guys so much!

802
01:04:11.685 --> 01:04:13.728
When you're up
in the stands. you're cheering

803
01:04:13.812 --> 01:04:16.898
not for a team that you like.

804
01:04:16.898 --> 01:04:20.068
You're cheering for your team
that you put work into.

805
01:04:20.068 --> 01:04:22.696
And you're also cheering for
your alliance members.

806
01:04:23.697 --> 01:04:25.573
Oh. and also there's scouting.

807
01:04:25.657 --> 01:04:29.035
Okay. so you guys are Red Alliance.
And these guys are Blue Alliance.

808
01:04:29.119 --> 01:04:30.120
- We're Red?
- Yeah.

809
01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:32.580
You guys need to coordinate
between the three of you.

810
01:04:32.664 --> 01:04:35.834
You're actively collecting data
from each of the matches.

811
01:04:35.834 --> 01:04:38.003
You're just looking and it's like. uh.

812
01:04:38.003 --> 01:04:40.505
"Oh. that robot shot three Power Cells.

813
01:04:40.505 --> 01:04:41.589
Write that down.

814
01:04:42.090 --> 01:04:44.634
That robot shot four Power Cells.
Write that down.

815
01:04:46.011 --> 01:04:48.388
Ooh. A tech foul. Write that down."

816
01:04:48.388 --> 01:04:51.182
980. No defense.

817
01:04:51.266 --> 01:04:52.559
Note their defense.

818
01:04:52.559 --> 01:04:55.812
That's not as fun. but still...
You're doing stuff from the stands.

819
01:05:00.191 --> 01:05:03.236
Then there is another kind of scouting
and that's scouting in the pits.

820
01:05:03.236 --> 01:05:04.779
Asking other teams questions.

821
01:05:04.863 --> 01:05:07.073
I'm Jacob. I'm from Team 4201.

822
01:05:07.157 --> 01:05:09.325
I just wanted to ask you a few questions
about your robot.

823
01:05:09.409 --> 01:05:13.496
Thinking about what kind of skills
you would like in an alliance partner.

824
01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:15.707
Can you climb?

825
01:05:15.707 --> 01:05:16.875
- Well--
- We can climb.

826
01:05:16.875 --> 01:05:19.961
You get to ask them stuff like.
"Can your robot do this and that?"

827
01:05:21.046 --> 01:05:25.216
Which is really important
in actually choosing an alliance.

828
01:05:30.972 --> 01:05:33.183
Right now. The TeraWatts are ranked 37th.

829
01:05:33.183 --> 01:05:35.810
But this competition.
it's all about climbing.

830
01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:38.271
I'll tell you this right now.

831
01:05:38.355 --> 01:05:40.273
There are only 15 teams total

832
01:05:40.357 --> 01:05:42.901
that have demonstrated a climb
during this Regional.

833
01:05:42.901 --> 01:05:44.527
and you guys are one of them.

834
01:05:44.611 --> 01:05:47.655
So that means you guys
are top 25% right now.

835
01:05:48.656 --> 01:05:50.075
That's really good. Good job out there.

836
01:05:51.493 --> 01:05:54.829
The problem that the Vitruvian Bots had
in most of our matches

837
01:05:54.913 --> 01:05:57.665
is another robot
hasn't been able to consistently climb.

838
01:05:57.749 --> 01:06:00.251
So if another robot can get themselves
up there and stay up there.

839
01:06:00.335 --> 01:06:02.253
we'll be able to balance with them.
get their support.

840
01:06:02.337 --> 01:06:03.713
- We can do that.
- You can do that.

841
01:06:03.797 --> 01:06:05.131
Maybe we'll be in an alliance.

842
01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:13.640
Welcome to the alliance selection
here at the LA Regionals!

843
01:06:14.808 --> 01:06:20.105
We have our ranks. and it's time
to allow them to pick their partners.

844
01:06:20.105 --> 01:06:25.735
Please welcome your top-ranked team. 4201!

845
01:06:25.819 --> 01:06:29.155
<i>From Da Vinci Science
in El Segundo. California.</i>

846
01:06:29.239 --> 01:06:32.242
<i>it's the Vitruvian Bots.</i>

847
01:06:33.201 --> 01:06:36.287
Who will you invite to join your alliance?

848
01:06:37.789 --> 01:06:41.835
Team 4201
would like to roll the dice with Team 987.

849
01:06:44.129 --> 01:06:47.132
Team 987. do you accept?

850
01:06:47.132 --> 01:06:50.927
Team 987 graciously accepts
4201's invitation.

851
01:06:51.803 --> 01:06:54.431
They're now on the first seed alliance.

852
01:06:55.390 --> 01:07:00.478
Team 3408 graciously invites Team 5802.
Los STEMateros. to their alliance.

853
01:07:00.562 --> 01:07:01.688
Whoo!

854
01:07:01.688 --> 01:07:03.690
On to number four.

855
01:07:03.690 --> 01:07:07.861
It's Team 207's turn.
Who will you invite to join your alliance?

856
01:07:07.861 --> 01:07:13.074
Team 207 would love to invite
Team 2637 to our alliance.

857
01:07:13.158 --> 01:07:14.451
There we are.

858
01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:18.079
Up to the fifth seed captain.

859
01:07:18.163 --> 01:07:24.711
5553 and 1515 would like to invite 6904.

860
01:07:25.879 --> 01:07:29.049
Okay. We have our fifth seed alliance.

861
01:07:29.716 --> 01:07:32.010
Four more teams to go.

862
01:07:32.010 --> 01:07:36.264
I didn't believe it at first.
I was thinking. like. "Is he just joking?"

863
01:07:37.015 --> 01:07:39.809
So we were kind of excited.

864
01:07:41.102 --> 01:07:45.231
Because we got selected for an alliance.
we have a chance to go to Championships.

865
01:07:46.608 --> 01:07:50.612
On the climb. we ended up losing 25 points

866
01:07:50.612 --> 01:07:52.906
because there was touching
at the bottom of it.

867
01:07:52.906 --> 01:07:55.200
Whoever's playing defense.
make sure you don't make contact

868
01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.077
'cause that's how they get
so many penalty points--

869
01:07:57.827 --> 01:07:59.913
One of the robots cannot shoot from the--

870
01:08:00.413 --> 01:08:01.873
- Cannot shoot from the Trench.
- Right.

871
01:08:01.873 --> 01:08:03.458
He's blocking that space
so they cannot shoot.

872
01:08:03.458 --> 01:08:04.667
There's a lot of fouls.

873
01:08:04.751 --> 01:08:06.920
He couldn't go in that area
'cause then we would get fouled.

874
01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:09.381
So against a number one team. we have to--

875
01:08:09.381 --> 01:08:11.925
Those points are important.
So we all have to be careful.

876
01:08:11.925 --> 01:08:15.553
- Let's double-check the robots--
- Restart the computer. batteries.

877
01:08:23.103 --> 01:08:26.272
Drivers. behind the lines!

878
01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:32.195
Three. Two. One. Go!

879
01:08:32.195 --> 01:08:35.281
<i>And quarterfinal two
tiebreaker on the way.</i>

880
01:08:35.365 --> 01:08:38.993
<i>On to Blue Alliance.
put some into the outer port.</i>

881
01:08:40.078 --> 01:08:42.997
<i>And the Blue Alliance takes a slight lead.
37-27.</i>

882
01:08:43.081 --> 01:08:44.666
- Whoa! Go. TeraWatts!
- Whoo!

883
01:08:45.917 --> 01:08:47.585
<i>All right. finding their positions.</i>

884
01:08:47.669 --> 01:08:50.338
<i>Jet Stream is in the top of the Trench
from there.</i>

885
01:08:51.089 --> 01:08:53.258
Someone should get--
Someone get the ball out of the way.

886
01:08:53.258 --> 01:08:56.261
Yeah. can you guys move the ball?
Move the balls out of the way. Yes.

887
01:08:56.261 --> 01:08:59.055
<i>Blue Alliance. nice shooting all around.</i>

888
01:08:59.723 --> 01:09:01.474
<i>A very close match.</i>

889
01:09:03.977 --> 01:09:05.895
<i>...with their long shots going in.</i>

890
01:09:05.979 --> 01:09:08.398
- Yeah. go. Go. go. go. go.
- <i>MorTorq trying to get it in.</i>

891
01:09:08.398 --> 01:09:09.858
Go. Try the climb.

892
01:09:09.858 --> 01:09:12.277
Go. go. go. Line up. Marco!

893
01:09:12.277 --> 01:09:14.320
<i>It could come down to this endgame...</i>

894
01:09:17.157 --> 01:09:18.450
<i>And here we go.</i>

895
01:09:18.450 --> 01:09:20.827
Yeah! Go!

896
01:09:22.078 --> 01:09:24.581
<i>Thirty seconds to go.
The endgame being played.</i>

897
01:09:24.581 --> 01:09:25.874
There we go. There we go.

898
01:09:25.874 --> 01:09:27.375
Pick it up now!

899
01:09:27.459 --> 01:09:29.586
<i>MorTorq trying to find a location</i>

900
01:09:29.586 --> 01:09:32.422
<i>where they can get in
to get their hook up.</i>

901
01:09:33.548 --> 01:09:35.300
<i>Eleven. ten seconds to go!</i>

902
01:09:36.885 --> 01:09:37.969
We're way too-- Yeah.

903
01:09:38.053 --> 01:09:41.181
<i>Replacement robots are being put on top.</i>

904
01:09:41.181 --> 01:09:44.476
<i>53-56.</i>

905
01:09:44.976 --> 01:09:45.977
Man.

906
01:09:46.728 --> 01:09:48.355
Our robot did pull the climb.

907
01:09:48.355 --> 01:09:51.941
But the climb got stuck halfway.
So. it just didn't count.

908
01:09:53.526 --> 01:09:56.738
<i>Our referees
are confirming all the scores.</i>

909
01:09:57.322 --> 01:10:00.700
<i>Whoever wins will go on to the semifinals.</i>

910
01:10:04.746 --> 01:10:05.747
<i>Scores coming up.</i>

911
01:10:05.747 --> 01:10:10.001
<i>It's gonna be the Red Alliance
advancing to our semifinals.</i>

912
01:10:10.877 --> 01:10:13.713
<i>113-66.</i>

913
01:10:13.797 --> 01:10:15.840
<i>Red Alliance will be advancing.</i>

914
01:10:16.675 --> 01:10:18.968
<i>Let's give these guys a round of applause.</i>

915
01:10:19.052 --> 01:10:24.724
<i>5553. 1515 and 6904.</i>

916
01:10:24.808 --> 01:10:26.893
Good job. Good job. You did a good job.

917
01:10:29.312 --> 01:10:30.980
It's really not about winning.

918
01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:35.276
Of course. it's a competition.
You wanna. like. do well.

919
01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:37.904
But what it's really about is the skills
the kids learn.

920
01:10:37.904 --> 01:10:39.823
Communication. Working together.

921
01:10:39.823 --> 01:10:41.366
Solving problems.

922
01:10:42.534 --> 01:10:46.204
Winning comes in life skills. Right?
And the kids actually feel that.

923
01:10:46.204 --> 01:10:49.290
It's not just. "Don't worry.
You were a good sport. You played well."

924
01:10:49.374 --> 01:10:52.502
No. the kids actually will be like.
"Wow. We actually grew a lot."

925
01:10:53.086 --> 01:10:54.170
They understand that.

926
01:10:55.046 --> 01:10:57.298
You need to be proud.
You guys got really far.

927
01:10:58.049 --> 01:11:00.218
And it was a really simple robot.
right. so...

928
01:11:00.218 --> 01:11:01.302
Yeah.

929
01:11:01.386 --> 01:11:04.222
We did pretty good.
We got to the quarterfinals.

930
01:11:04.222 --> 01:11:06.433
Which we were all happy for. so...

931
01:11:06.433 --> 01:11:09.102
Yeah.
Well. we gotta stay for the awards. right?

932
01:11:09.894 --> 01:11:13.189
The safety award.
I want the safety award.

933
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:20.071
Welcome
to the Los Angeles Regional Finals!

934
01:11:21.156 --> 01:11:24.200
One alliance will be
our regional champions.

935
01:11:24.284 --> 01:11:26.661
One will be our finalists.

936
01:11:26.745 --> 01:11:31.666
Let's hear it for Team 4201!

937
01:11:35.712 --> 01:11:38.298
1197 likes to stick their nose out
over the line.

938
01:11:38.298 --> 01:11:40.008
- Yeah. but it's--
- So we can hit them.

939
01:11:40.008 --> 01:11:42.427
And we just need to sit here
and ping-pong between 'em.

940
01:11:42.427 --> 01:11:43.511
All right.

941
01:11:43.595 --> 01:11:45.138
- All right. good?
- Yeah. I'm good.

942
01:11:45.138 --> 01:11:46.222
- Good luck. guys.
- Okay.

943
01:11:46.306 --> 01:11:48.725
Drivers. behind the line.

944
01:11:49.267 --> 01:11:53.313
Three. two. one. go!

945
01:12:19.756 --> 01:12:21.424
<i>Here come the TorBots...</i>

946
01:12:24.469 --> 01:12:28.473
<i>The Blue Alliance is having
to feed Power Cells into the field.</i>

947
01:12:32.185 --> 01:12:33.561
chanRed Alliance!

948
01:12:34.771 --> 01:12:36.064
Red Alliance!

949
01:12:37.399 --> 01:12:38.733
Red Alliance!

950
01:12:39.359 --> 01:12:42.487
<i>It's time to climb. It's 140-75.</i>

951
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:50.203
<i>The High Rollers and the Vitruvian Bots
are gonna try and balance that switch.</i>

952
01:12:51.204 --> 01:12:54.791
<i>The High Rollers are attached.
The Vitruvian Bots are up.</i>

953
01:13:12.392 --> 01:13:15.395
<i>And it was the Red Alliance!</i>

954
01:13:18.273 --> 01:13:19.774
Yeah!

955
01:13:24.446 --> 01:13:25.530
Nice!

956
01:13:30.577 --> 01:13:33.747
It turned out
that we had a well-built robot

957
01:13:33.747 --> 01:13:38.585
that was very good at the game
and doing things quickly.

958
01:13:39.085 --> 01:13:40.128
Congratulations.

959
01:13:40.128 --> 01:13:43.673
I was doubting it earlier.
but it seemed to work out very nicely.

960
01:13:43.757 --> 01:13:49.679
There were no electrical or wiring issues.
which is pretty astonishing. actually.

961
01:13:49.763 --> 01:13:53.058
Usually. there are at least seven
at a regional.

962
01:13:54.684 --> 01:13:55.769
Because of the coronavirus.

963
01:13:55.769 --> 01:14:00.315
events have. in fact. been closed
and teams have been removed from events.

964
01:14:01.483 --> 01:14:04.235
Do I think Championships
are going to be called off?

965
01:14:04.319 --> 01:14:06.613
Oh. I hope not. Of course. I hope not.

966
01:14:25.507 --> 01:14:28.843
It was just a few days
after our win at the LA Regional

967
01:14:28.927 --> 01:14:30.887
and we were riding high as a team.

968
01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:34.641
We were excited.
We were ready to go to Championships.

969
01:14:36.101 --> 01:14:39.312
But people were
already starting to get nervous.

970
01:14:44.359 --> 01:14:48.988
I just happened to check my e-mail
and something popped up.

971
01:14:49.072 --> 01:14:53.993
It was a message and it said
that Championships was canceled

972
01:14:54.869 --> 01:14:57.914
due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

973
01:14:59.290 --> 01:15:03.962
March 12th. 2020.
"Dear friends. colleagues and partners..."

974
01:15:03.962 --> 01:15:05.380
"It is with deep disappointment

975
01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:09.217
that I share an update on the immediate
suspension of the current FIRST season

976
01:15:09.217 --> 01:15:11.511
and the cancellation
of both Championship events."

977
01:15:11.511 --> 01:15:14.264
"This cancellation
of both Championship events."

978
01:15:14.264 --> 01:15:16.307
"The cancellation of both Championship"--

979
01:15:16.391 --> 01:15:18.268
"Both Championship events."

980
01:15:18.268 --> 01:15:20.353
"The decision has been made
based on guidance

981
01:15:20.437 --> 01:15:22.147
from the World Health Organization.

982
01:15:22.147 --> 01:15:23.440
Centers for Disease Control.

983
01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:26.735
and state and local health officials
as well as the declaration of..."

984
01:15:29.529 --> 01:15:31.364
I had been looking forward to going.

985
01:15:32.282 --> 01:15:35.493
We had worked out everything in the robot.

986
01:15:35.577 --> 01:15:39.581
We were just prepared
to take on anyone and everyone.

987
01:15:40.623 --> 01:15:43.877
I'm sure there were other teams that
have been looking forward to competing

988
01:15:43.877 --> 01:15:47.088
because there were some teams
that never really got to compete.

989
01:15:53.136 --> 01:15:56.222
When I heard the rest
of the season will be suspended.

990
01:15:57.098 --> 01:15:59.642
I was really. really shocked.

991
01:16:37.138 --> 01:16:44.020
And just to not have that.
it's kind of really hard.

992
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.294
To everybody in the FIRST community.

993
01:17:09.295 --> 01:17:12.132
FIRST has never been about the robots.

994
01:17:12.132 --> 01:17:15.176
It's never been about the competitions.

995
01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:17.512
It's never been about the events.

996
01:17:18.304 --> 01:17:21.266
It's about building a community...

997
01:17:21.266 --> 01:17:24.519
and at this point.
it's a global community.

998
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:30.066
Let's use this situation as a reminder
of how important it is

999
01:17:30.150 --> 01:17:31.985
that we all work together.

1000
01:17:33.278 --> 01:17:37.907
We should see this problem.
like all other problems.

1001
01:17:38.783 --> 01:17:44.289
as an opportunity to create a solution
that not only will benefit us

1002
01:17:44.289 --> 01:17:49.169
but will be scalable to help the rest
of the world deal with this problem.

1003
01:17:50.962 --> 01:17:52.922
Even though the robotics season
was canceled.

1004
01:17:53.006 --> 01:17:56.009
we were still very into. like.
a robotics mindset.

1005
01:17:56.009 --> 01:17:57.302
We're kind of always into that.

1006
01:17:58.303 --> 01:18:03.350
Once we saw the challenges of health care
workers and essential workers needing PPE.

1007
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:07.854
we decided that we would help out
- by 3-
- D printing headbands.

1008
01:18:07.854 --> 01:18:11.566
face shields.
and then also sewing. um. face masks.

1009
01:18:22.827 --> 01:18:26.164
<i>The Afghan girls'
robotics team in Herat. Afghanistan.</i>

1010
01:18:26.164 --> 01:18:28.291
<i>is busy designing something
completely different--</i>

1011
01:18:28.958 --> 01:18:32.921
<i>much-needed ventilators
during the coronavirus pandemic.</i>

1012
01:18:32.921 --> 01:18:35.632
My team is 5653.

1013
01:18:36.257 --> 01:18:39.511
We were having a discussion about
what is something that we could do

1014
01:18:39.511 --> 01:18:40.887
to help our community with.

1015
01:18:42.764 --> 01:18:45.350
And that ended up being
the grocery delivery robot.

1016
01:18:47.102 --> 01:18:52.023
If you wanted quantitative proof
of the impact of FIRST.

1017
01:18:52.107 --> 01:18:55.860
all you have to do is look at what's
happening through this COVID crisis.

1018
01:18:57.070 --> 01:19:02.951
Not one. not two. not three.
but most of the thousands of teams

1019
01:19:02.951 --> 01:19:05.995
immediately mobilized
in many different ways.

1020
01:19:06.079 --> 01:19:07.497
because that's what FIRST is about.

1021
01:19:10.709 --> 01:19:13.128
I've been talking with
the other team members.

1022
01:19:13.128 --> 01:19:18.425
telling them that it doesn't matter
if we are. like. all apart.

1023
01:19:18.425 --> 01:19:22.178
I mean. we are still a family.
We are still a team.

1024
01:19:22.262 --> 01:19:26.725
So we were like.
"We can do something here in Mexico."

1025
01:19:26.725 --> 01:19:30.395
- Some people don't have Wi-
- Fi and a laptop.

1026
01:19:30.979 --> 01:19:35.066
so we are preparing presentations
for those students

1027
01:19:35.150 --> 01:19:38.653
so they can still be learning
in this quarantine.

1028
01:19:39.821 --> 01:19:41.823
These kids were mobilized to say.

1029
01:19:41.823 --> 01:19:43.575
"I see a problem out there.

1030
01:19:43.575 --> 01:19:47.328
I've gotta start working on a solution
and we better do something."

1031
01:19:49.039 --> 01:19:51.374
There's not one right strategy for a robot

1032
01:19:51.458 --> 01:19:54.461
and there is not one right response
to COVID.

1033
01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:25.533
When we see a crisis.

1034
01:20:25.617 --> 01:20:27.577
when we see a problem
that we're trying to solve.

1035
01:20:27.577 --> 01:20:30.705
the first thing that comes
to people's minds is. "How do I solve it?

1036
01:20:30.789 --> 01:20:32.374
How do I tackle the problem?"

1037
01:20:32.374 --> 01:20:34.084
That's kind of built into FIRST.

1038
01:20:34.709 --> 01:20:38.046
This is one of those situations
where. as a world.

1039
01:20:38.046 --> 01:20:40.465
we need to work together
to solve this problem.

1040
01:20:42.258 --> 01:20:43.510
Is it on?

1041
01:20:44.094 --> 01:20:45.220
Brilliant.

1042
01:20:45.220 --> 01:20:49.641
My team has continued
to have robotics meetings.

1043
01:20:49.641 --> 01:20:53.520
We're trying to figure out
what we could be doing to help.

1044
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:57.232
I'm teaching everyone on the team
how to code.

1045
01:20:57.857 --> 01:21:01.736
It's honestly
a very important skill to have

1046
01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:05.115
because technology. ultimately.
it's the future.

1047
01:21:08.493 --> 01:21:10.203
No one likes this quarantine

1048
01:21:10.203 --> 01:21:13.707
because you kinda need
human interactions with other people.

1049
01:21:14.749 --> 01:21:19.170
So one project
that we're working on is a podcast.

1050
01:21:19.921 --> 01:21:22.966
It's so beautiful that they've
come to this podcast being about.

1051
01:21:22.966 --> 01:21:25.635
you know. people of color
overcoming barriers in STEM.

1052
01:21:26.428 --> 01:21:27.429
<i>Join us once a month</i>

1053
01:21:27.429 --> 01:21:30.682
<i>as we talk to other people of color
leading in STEM.</i>

1054
01:21:30.682 --> 01:21:32.642
<i>Get to learn about the obstacles
they have faced</i>

1055
01:21:32.726 --> 01:21:34.227
<i>and how they overcame them.</i>

1056
01:21:34.227 --> 01:21:36.021
They've seen their resources lacking

1057
01:21:36.021 --> 01:21:39.399
and they're finding ways now
to talk about it and overcome it.

1058
01:21:39.399 --> 01:21:42.944
I think it's gonna be a great way
to let their voice be heard.

1059
01:21:44.404 --> 01:21:47.407
I'm not surprised that so many teams
have stepped up.

1060
01:21:48.450 --> 01:21:51.119
These are the values
that FIRST really encourages.

1061
01:21:51.745 --> 01:21:54.914
They choose to still find humor
and laugh and smile.

1062
01:21:54.998 --> 01:21:57.959
and be there for each other.
and not lose sight of their commitments.

1063
01:21:58.043 --> 01:22:00.879
and I find that. you know.
really. really inspiring.

1064
01:22:01.921 --> 01:22:05.842
FIRST really promotes Coopertition.
gracious professionalism

1065
01:22:05.842 --> 01:22:08.762
and teaches children to be adults.

1066
01:22:08.762 --> 01:22:11.056
to turn into these responsible.

1067
01:22:11.056 --> 01:22:14.809
communicative. empathetic.
collaborative adults.

1068
01:22:15.852 --> 01:22:17.604
It is way more than a club.

1069
01:22:18.813 --> 01:22:22.817
It's like a way of life almost. right?
Teaches you the skills of life.

1070
01:22:26.321 --> 01:22:29.991
I personally really want
every student in Japan to. like.

1071
01:22:30.075 --> 01:22:35.538
have the opportunity to learn engineering
through FIRST because it's really awesome.

1072
01:22:36.456 --> 01:22:41.419
I'm also working at FIRST Japan
so that we can create more teams in Japan.

1073
01:22:42.170 --> 01:22:44.130
The community here is amazing.

1074
01:22:44.214 --> 01:22:48.468
Suddenly you have so many friends
from all around the world.

1075
01:22:49.302 --> 01:22:50.845
That's just so important.

1076
01:23:27.424 --> 01:23:28.591
FIRST helped me.

1077
01:23:28.675 --> 01:23:29.801
Life is like a game.

1078
01:23:29.801 --> 01:23:33.263
To succeed. you have to pass one thing
to go to the next level

1079
01:23:33.263 --> 01:23:36.516
and if you don't put work in
or time into that.

1080
01:23:36.516 --> 01:23:38.810
then you're not gonna
move on to the next level.

1081
01:23:40.353 --> 01:23:43.523
I think it's important
that we teach the new generation

1082
01:23:44.482 --> 01:23:47.652
because if they really want to get into.
like. engineering a robot--

1083
01:23:47.736 --> 01:23:49.821
I feel like they should start
in either FIRST.

1084
01:23:49.821 --> 01:23:51.531
or any other division of it.

1085
01:23:51.531 --> 01:23:53.450
because you take away a lot from it.

1086
01:23:54.951 --> 01:23:56.369
It's like a family basically.

1087
01:23:56.453 --> 01:23:59.414
Because we all get along
and we have to help each other out.

1088
01:23:59.414 --> 01:24:02.709
But when we're not doing that. you know.
we just hang out. crack jokes.

1089
01:24:07.213 --> 01:24:08.757
What FIRST Robotics has done

1090
01:24:08.757 --> 01:24:11.176
is it showed me how to work
as part of a team.

1091
01:24:11.176 --> 01:24:14.596
It showed me
how to effectively collaborate

1092
01:24:14.596 --> 01:24:18.767
and that working on a team
is in fact possible.

1093
01:24:18.767 --> 01:24:21.686
And in some cases
better than working individually.

1094
01:24:22.937 --> 01:24:27.150
If our world can work as a team.
everything will work out.

1095
01:24:29.652 --> 01:24:34.532
FIRST is respect. It is teamwork.
It is technology.

1096
01:24:34.616 --> 01:24:36.618
It is preparing students for the future.

1097
01:24:36.618 --> 01:24:37.702
It is...

1098
01:24:39.079 --> 01:24:40.413
more than robots.

1099
01:25:08.692 --> 01:25:12.320
I realized that
I really like to help people.

1100
01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:15.699
so I've become a mentor.

1101
01:25:16.908 --> 01:25:21.538
and now my job is to share all of
that knowledge that I have with my team.

1102
01:25:24.499 --> 01:25:27.961
This is how I'm getting to build a legacy.

1103
01:25:30.714 --> 01:25:36.011
Without FIRST. I wouldn't have these
people around me that inspire me so much.

1104
01:25:52.902 --> 01:25:55.196
I still don't know what career
I'm going to choose.

1105
01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:57.115
but right now. I'm not afraid of it.

1106
01:26:00.118 --> 01:26:04.581
FIRST has given me the opportunity
to become better and better

1107
01:26:04.581 --> 01:26:06.875
and to never stop dreaming.

1108
01:26:16.092 --> 01:26:21.723
We created FIRST to inspire kids.
but over the years what I realized was

1109
01:26:21.723 --> 01:26:26.561
the inspiration is what these kids
are doing for their teachers

1110
01:26:26.561 --> 01:26:28.480
and their mentors and their parents.

1111
01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:31.941
And when you can take
sometimes the most unlikely kids.

1112
01:26:32.025 --> 01:26:34.944
and they reluctantly go
to this FIRST meeting.

1113
01:26:35.028 --> 01:26:37.322
and they're intimidated
to look at all this stuff.

1114
01:26:37.322 --> 01:26:38.740
And by the end of the season.

1115
01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:42.994
they'll look you right in the eye
and they'll say. "I can do this."

1116
01:26:43.578 --> 01:26:45.246
and they inspire us.
