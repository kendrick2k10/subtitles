1048
01:16:50.708 --> 01:16:55.166
I guess. without telling him to. I...

1049
01:16:56.625 --> 01:17:00.875
I guess my loud and clear
was pretty quiet.

1050
01:17:01.625 --> 01:17:02.541
- Hey.

1051
01:17:05.166 --> 01:17:06.083
Progress.

1052
01:17:44.708 --> 01:17:46.208
- (Joe) Excuse me. ma’am?

1053
01:17:46.666 --> 01:17:47.666
We’re closed.

1054
01:17:47.958 --> 01:17:51.250
- Oh. oh. I’m sorry.

1055
01:17:51.416 --> 01:17:54.125
- Let me help you.
- Oh. thank you.

1056
01:17:55.583 --> 01:17:58.208
Joseph. right?
- Yes. ma’am.

1057
01:18:00.083 --> 01:18:01.250
- You’re a saint.

1058
01:18:02.291 --> 01:18:03.833
- Then come follow me.

1059
01:18:04.833 --> 01:18:06.000
- Okay.

1060
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.875
- You didn’t know? I didn’t know either.

1061
01:18:50.333 --> 01:18:52.041
Great place though. huh?

1062
01:18:54.541 --> 01:18:55.583
- (Eli) Yeah.

1063
01:18:57.458 --> 01:18:58.666
Do you remember me?

1064
01:19:00.166 --> 01:19:01.875
- Yes. of course. young man.

1065
01:19:01.875 --> 01:19:06.125
- Oh. okay. ’Cause I remember you.

1066
01:19:08.625 --> 01:19:11.208
- Well. my memory is not what it used to
be

1067
01:19:11.208 --> 01:19:15.500
and it’s been quite a while
but I’m Lillian.

1068
01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:16.541
- I'm Eli.

1069
01:19:18.750 --> 01:19:19.750
- You look better.

1070
01:19:19.916 --> 01:19:20.916
- Excuse me?

1071
01:19:20.958 --> 01:19:23.166
- Better than the last time I saw you.

1072
01:19:24.083 --> 01:19:27.250
- Ah. Was it that obvious?

1073
01:19:27.250 --> 01:19:28.708
(LILLY LAUGHS)

1074
01:19:29.083 --> 01:19:31.083
You’d been punched in the face.

1075
01:19:33.583 --> 01:19:35.500
- I thought I’d been a bad little boy.

1076
01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:40.333
- Oh. I always say. men are little boys--

1077
01:19:40.333 --> 01:19:41.375
(Together) --with whiskers.

1078
01:19:42.125 --> 01:19:42.958
- Yes.

1079
01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.541
Have you had a job tonight?

1080
01:19:49.375 --> 01:19:50.541
- Oh. yes. I have.

1081
01:19:50.958 --> 01:19:54.208
I play in the pit of the
revival of Brigadoon.

1082
01:19:54.416 --> 01:19:58.416
- Oh. oh it’s a classic. Very beautiful.

1083
01:19:58.750 --> 01:20:03.625
It’s about two hunters who stumble across
a remote. tiny Scottish village

1084
01:20:03.625 --> 01:20:07.333
that only comes to life
every hundred years.

1085
01:20:09.791 --> 01:20:11.458
I live over there.
- Oh.

1086
01:20:13.083 --> 01:20:14.666
Well can I walk you home. Lillian?

1087
01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.666
- You haven’t done this in awhile.
have you. young man?

1088
01:20:17.666 --> 01:20:18.500
- What?

1089
01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:21.750
- Taken a good woman’s arm.
(ELI LAUGHS)

1090
01:20:23.958 --> 01:20:27.416
- Oh. you. Remember me?

1091
01:20:27.666 --> 01:20:28.750
- I was the dick.

1092
01:20:29.833 --> 01:20:30.625
- Yeah.

1093
01:20:31.333 --> 01:20:35.250
- (Lilly) Oh. for goodness sake.
oh my goodness.

1094
01:20:35.458 --> 01:20:39.291
you look so cold. young man.
- Oh. I’m okay. Thank you. Okay.

1095
01:20:40.875 --> 01:20:41.708
Thank you.

1096
01:20:42.291 --> 01:20:43.750
- What are you doing out here so late?

1097
01:20:45.958 --> 01:20:50.541
- Just forgot how long it’s been. They
locked me out.

1098
01:20:54.791 --> 01:20:56.083
- You were there when I was here.

1099
01:20:56.916 --> 01:20:59.666
- Yeah. uh. my husband worked there.

1100
01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:04.791
- Your husband? Really? Who was that?

1101
01:21:06.166 --> 01:21:06.791
- Matthew.

1102
01:21:06.791 --> 01:21:09.791
- (Lilly) Oh yes. I remember him.

1103
01:21:10.083 --> 01:21:12.083
You do. don’t you. Eli?

1104
01:21:12.083 --> 01:21:15.541
- Yeah. That little guy
almost kicked my ass.

1105
01:21:15.541 --> 01:21:17.541
(GABE LAUGHS)
- Like I had it coming. but--

1106
01:21:17.541 --> 01:21:19.208
- Yeah. that’s Matt.

1107
01:21:22.083 --> 01:21:23.875
Jesus. I just love that about him.

1108
01:21:27.791 --> 01:21:29.541
Well. hopefully I’ll see
you guys around. okay?

1109
01:21:29.541 --> 01:21:30.416
- Wait.

1110
01:21:41.458 --> 01:21:42.291
- Thanks.

1111
01:21:42.291 --> 01:21:43.291
- I wish I had more.

1112
01:21:43.833 --> 01:21:45.125
- This is all your cash? No no.

1113
01:21:45.125 --> 01:21:46.333
it’s a rough neighborhood--
- Nope.

1114
01:21:46.416 --> 01:21:48.000
- (Gabe) You need to get home.
- I insist.

1115
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.875
- Don’t worry. I will look after him.

1116
01:21:55.625 --> 01:21:59.583
- I wish there was more of this going
around. Thank you.

1117
01:22:05.041 --> 01:22:07.125
- (Gabe) Good night. guys.
- Good luck.

1118
01:22:22.958 --> 01:22:24.958
- Where did you get the necklace?

1119
01:22:26.083 --> 01:22:30.083
- Oh. um. my father gave it to me.

1120
01:22:30.958 --> 01:22:34.875
and his mother gave it to him.

1121
01:22:37.583 --> 01:22:40.125
- That would be your-- your grandmother.

1122
01:22:42.083 --> 01:22:43.000
- Yes.

1123
01:22:43.666 --> 01:22:47.000
- And where is she?

1124
01:22:49.333 --> 01:22:50.791
- I have no idea.

1125
01:22:52.541 --> 01:22:54.666
When Jews melt down the families scatter.

1126
01:22:55.916 --> 01:22:57.708
- They-- they did.

1127
01:22:58.791 --> 01:22:59.875
We did.

1128
01:23:07.833 --> 01:23:09.166
- But that’s not fair.

1129
01:23:10.541 --> 01:23:13.583
- No. Eli. no.

1130
01:23:14.875 --> 01:23:18.458
No it’s not fair. but. oh...

1131
01:23:19.875 --> 01:23:21.541
(LILLY LAUGHS)

1132
01:23:21.541 --> 01:23:23.375
(ELI LAUGHS)

1133
01:23:23.375 --> 01:23:26.375
I will you tell you all about her.
