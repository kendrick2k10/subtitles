00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.800
IN THE SUMMER OF 2019.
THE THREE WISE KINGS

4
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.240
ARE NOT AT THEIR MOST POPULAR MOMENT.

5
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.200
LIKELY BECAUSE OF THIS.
GASPAR INVITES A FILM CREW

6
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.680
INTO THEIR PALACE
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY.

7
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.760
THIS IS THE RESULT.

8
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.640
Watch out. please.
Everything's very fragile.

9
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.560
Thanks. guys.

10
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.040
Hello. welcome.

11
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.400
The rug... Goodness!

12
00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.000
My name is...

13
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.280
LOLA
MANAGER

14
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.360
...Lola Gutiérrez.

15
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.160
And...

16
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.080
Well...

17
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.680
I recently started working with them.

18
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.080
I'm their new manager.

19
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.800
For the Three Wise Kings.

20
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.320
They'll be here soon.

21
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:31.920
Just a second.

22
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.759
They're being very generous. because...

23
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.640
They've opened the doors to their home.

24
00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.640
Just a moment.

25
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.920
Your Majesty. listen...

26
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.920
The documentary crew is here and...

27
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.520
Well. we're waiting for you.
Please let me know soon. all right?

28
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.160
Thank you. It's already 10:00 a.m.

29
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.040
Thank you. Lots of love. Thanks.

30
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.240
I'm going to let them know.
because... Right?

31
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.480
I'm going to check. Be right back.

32
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.240
Everything's fine.

33
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.880
This is huge. they could be anywhere.

34
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.560
Sometimes. they get distracted
because they have a busy schedule.

35
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.079
Hi! Do you know where
the Three Wise Kings are?

36
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.720
She doesn't know.

37
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.000
They must have overslept.

38
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.480
They work a lot. so...

39
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.720
I'll just...

40
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.320
Let's see in here.

41
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.400
Come in.

42
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.240
Hi. how are you?

43
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.880
I can hear some voices.
I think they're down here.

44
00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:58.200
Let's check it out.

45
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.240
-I told you a month ago.
-A month? What year was that?

46
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.080
-This year. next year?
-Hello! Your Majesties.

47
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.880
This...

48
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.680
-What's this?
-The documentary.

49
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.120
-Today?
-What documentary?

50
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.079
I don't want to do any documentary.
What does one do in a documentary?

51
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.320
Come on. What does one do?
I've told you a million times already.

52
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.040
-You don't have to do anything.
-Don't yell at me with your mouth open.

53
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.840
It's impossible to talk to you.

54
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.880
-I just go through a normal day?
-They just record you.

55
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.400
I eat. sleep. play the harp.
that's the documentary?

56
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.040
-And growling.
-That's all.

57
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.840
-That's the documentary.
-Really?

58
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.160
-And who is this lady?
-Lola. our new manager.

59
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.960
We met the other day. remember?

60
00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.280
We've never had a manager. for God's sake.

61
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.040
-Honestly.
-Unbelievable. You never ask our opinion.

62
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.760
-You get on my nerves.
-You never ask. Listen!

63
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.040
You never ask our opinion!
And you know it.

64
00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.160
He's right.

65
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.960
Whatever.

66
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
I'm sorry. Melchor is...

67
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.360
-He's a bit bonkers.
-Yeah.

68
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.800
They're recording already.

69
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.880
He's a stiff.

70
00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.720
-Where are you going?
-Melchor. please.

71
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.720
THE THREE WISE MEN:
THE TRUTH

72
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.160
GASPAR
WISE KING

73
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.000
Why a movie now? I'm glad you asked.

74
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.200
Hello.

75
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.640
For the boys and girls around the world.

76
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.800
who must be eager to meet their idols.

77
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.640
A whim.

78
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.159
Would you like to see
where the magic is done?

79
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.040
Follow me.

80
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.120
That's Aramaic. It means.
"I'll create it on the go."

81
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.920
More or less.

82
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.720
That's magic. Sometimes. it opens a door.

83
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.040
and sometimes. it connects you
to a mentally inferior person

84
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.320
who opens it for you.

85
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.080
Shall we?

86
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.840
Hello!

87
00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.840
You weren't expecting
this kind of modernity. I know.

88
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.280
"The Three Wise Kings
are outdated. out of the loop..."

89
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.560
Not at all.

90
00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.760
Information technology.

91
00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.320
The future. right here. in your hands. Hi.

92
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.240
Can we have some incense?

93
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.000
Melchor has character. strength.

94
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.960
Gaspar is magical.

95
00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.840
He's witty.

96
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.560
Then there's me...

97
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.440
You have to tell me
which one is my best profile.

98
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.840
Right or left. the most interesting one.

99
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.440
Whatever...

100
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.320
It's not important. There are
more important matters than my profile.

101
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.280
BALTASAR
WISE KING

102
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.640
Well...

103
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.080
MELCHOR
WISE KING

104
00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:52.320
This is our warehouse.

105
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.600
You're doing great.
but if you could smile a little...

106
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.600
Thank you.

107
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.160
Okay. this is our warehouse.

108
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.520
Great. But you have
to tell us some more. For instance...

109
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.040
How many gifts do you have?

110
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.880
That depends on the year.

111
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.000
Usually. about three billion toys.

112
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.000
-Right.
-Billion.

113
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.800
Okay. tell us about how the gifts
are wrapped. where they come from...

114
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.680
The overall process. Okay?

115
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.960
-Please.
-Of course.

116
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:41.880
Thanks.

117
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.480
This is our warehouse!

118
00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.880
Okay. just... One last thing.

119
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.800
But no laughing.
No disrespect. your laughter is nice.

120
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.760
but they want something else.

121
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.440
-Please. Melchi. it's...
-Melchi?

122
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Sorry.

123
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.920
Bermúdez. come closer.

124
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.520
Set this up.

125
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.440
Everything's quiet now

126
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.600
because it's September
and the letters aren't here yet.

127
00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:25.080
but in December.
the office becomes pure adrenaline.

128
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.000
Am I right or am I right?

129
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.720
Canales. please. Cortezo.
Rodríguez. come a bit closer.

130
00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:36.320
Okay. there.

131
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.240
We're a great family.
And I'm the father of them all.

132
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.520
The captain of the ship.

133
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.120
Am I right?

134
00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.560
What? It's nice. isn't it?

135
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.880
Melchor and Gaspar don't have this.

136
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.520
It's beautiful. Look.

137
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.640
Just wait. because...

138
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.920
I don't usually do this. the pages do.

139
00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.960
This is...

140
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.200
This is...

141
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.600
Sorry. like I said. this isn't my job.

142
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.680
My children. I love them. My children.

143
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.480
But these are from last year.

144
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.240
This year's aren't here yet.

145
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.680
What can I say?

146
00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.720
To them. I'm their favorite.

147
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.720
No.

148
00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.720
No way. No.
All three of us are loved very much.

149
00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.800
and we're all their favorites.

150
00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.200
That's right.

151
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:14.520
I mean... Perhaps... Perhaps it's me.

152
00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.360
What would you rather have?

153
00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.920
A gold bar or a handful of myrrh?

154
00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.720
-The gold?
-Exactly. the gold.

155
00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.200
And I do all the work around here.

156
00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.840
The warehouse. the camels. the letters...

157
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.920
I don't mean
they don't do anything. Magic!

158
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.240
But I'm the one in charge of everything.

159
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.440
Children know that. and their parents too.

160
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.640
If there was no Melchor.

161
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.360
and that's me.
there would be no Three Wise Kings.

162
00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:53.760
Magic!

163
00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.560
Actually. your question is insulting.

164
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.400
Is this your documentary?

165
00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.480
This is it? For crying out loud.

166
00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.440
I'm sorry. He's a bit emotional.

167
00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:21.480
a bit passionate. but I mean...

168
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.240
Before doing this.

169
00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.560
I was Rozalén's manager. you know?

170
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.160
And the truth is

171
00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.560
she's a wonderful person too.

172
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.840
I fought a lot alongside her

173
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:45.040
to get her where she is now.

174
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.440
Right now. she's a real success.

175
00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.280
Without me. but...

176
00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:59.440
That's how everything started.
The Three Wise Kings came after that.

177
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.040
I'm doing great with them too.

178
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.640
We get along fine.

179
00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.320
I'm happy.

180
00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:23.080
The mall should provide the thrones.
They're the Three Wise Kings.

181
00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:28.160
Well. no. Normal chairs won't do.

182
00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.920
-Hi. Mom. Why are you so late?
-Sorry. It's because of my job.

183
00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.280
Let me finish this call.
then I'll be ready.

184
00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.360
Sorry.

185
00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.720
I don't know. some chairs
with gold upholstery...

186
00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.080
-Hi.
-With high backrests.

187
00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.480
-Mom. I'm getting in the car.
-I'll be there in a minute.

188
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.600
Come on. it's the Three Wise Kings.
The agreement said "thrones."

189
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.080
Thanks. Yes. see you later. Bye.

190
00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.280
-Mom. can you fasten my seatbelt?
-Sure. honey.

191
00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.640
I've had some trouble. but it's...

192
00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:12.040
It's all sorted out now.
Let's go. you have to do your homework.

193
00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.440
-We're going home. right?
-No.

194
00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.960
I don't usually go with Mom to her work.

195
00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.040
SOFÍA
LOLA'S DAUGHTER

196
00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.200
She leaves me with Carmen. our neighbor.

197
00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.040
-But since we're a single-parent family...
-Sofía.

198
00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:24.920
Sofía...

199
00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:29.640
Yes. we are a single-parent family.

200
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:33.600
but the two of us... I can do everything.

201
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.920
We do great on our own. don't we?

202
00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.480
This guy... I almost rammed that taxi.

203
00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:52.800
SEPTEMBER 28TH
99 DAYS UNTIL THE PARADE

204
00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:55.880
I think...

205
00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.480
Whenever you like.

206
00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:05.840
Are we ready?

207
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.040
Okay.

208
00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:16.080
Let's begin the interview.

209
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.400
They were wise men from the East.
That's all the Gospel of Matthew says.

210
00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.120
JORDI HURTADO
JOURNALIST/TV HOST

211
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.560
He doesn't mention
how many there were. nor their names.

212
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.400
nor what kind of magic they did.

213
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.240
Following a mysterious star.
they arrived in Bethlehem.

214
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.240
where they offered three gifts
to baby Jesus.

215
00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:47.920
This gentleman. how old is he?
Out of curiosity.

216
00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.040
-No idea.
-Does he ring a bell?

217
00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.360
He does seem kind of familiar. but...

218
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.360
Okay. but...

219
00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.800
Let's focus on the subject.

220
00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.760
You saw a star

221
00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.600
and followed it to a manger in Bethlehem.

222
00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.560
where a special child had been born.

223
00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.960
Sure. That's about it. isn't it?

224
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.840
-Yeah.
-Yes.

225
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.640
Didn't you notice anything special?

226
00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:29.440
They seemed like a normal family.
Of a normal social class.

227
00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:35.040
-A normal family... But poor.
-Humble.

228
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.600
-Humble and poor.
-Yeah. a really humble family.

229
00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.040
-Very poor.
-That's how our story began.

230
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:46.080
Under a starry night. with the smile
of a very special child in Bethlehem.

231
00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.200
We gave them our gifts.
said hello. then took off. I mean...

232
00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:57.720
Staying there would have been
like forcing them to give us dinner.

233
00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.640
Exactly. We were there for... ten minutes?

234
00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.520
Who could have known
what would happen with that kid?

235
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.200
Would any of you have guessed
anything of the sort?

236
00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.880
-Impossible.
-Neither did we.

237
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.120
No. that's...

238
00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:15.240
Nobody could have predicted it.

239
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.960
We're talking about many years ago.

240
00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.600
We're over 2.000 years old.

241
00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.400
I'd like to see you at our age.

242
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.560
To see what you can and can't remember.

243
00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.320
Right?

244
00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.600
What we see is that...

245
00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:38.800
GABRIEL CRUZ
JOURNALIST

246
00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.920
...from around 1950 onwards.

247
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.800
the Three Wise Kings
have been losing their influence.

248
00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:49.120
That's undeniable.
And. in an increasingly globalized world.

249
00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.760
with increasingly similar

250
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:55.400
behaviors between people.
Santa Claus is getting the upper hand.

251
00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:57.840
Okay.

252
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.440
Who says that?

253
00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:07.839
-A journalist called Gabriel Cruz.
-Who?

254
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.440
-Gabriel Cruz.
-Gabriel Cruz.

255
00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.160
He talks a lot. but doesn't say anything.

256
00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:17.040
He does mention something
that you should explain.

257
00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.480
Would you do it?

258
00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:22.800
-There's nothing to explain.
-Will you do it or should I?

259
00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.520
We do have to explain. Gaspar.
You may not want to.

260
00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:27.280
-But we should.
-Okay.

261
00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:29.160
We can keep quiet if you want.

262
00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.800
but if we're going to explain it.
you should be the one doing it.

263
00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:34.640
Okay. whatever.

264
00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.160
Simply put.

265
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.760
at the time. we refused

266
00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:46.320
to take part in a soft drink commercial.

267
00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:51.800
That's it. And who agreed
to do that commercial?

268
00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.560
-Who?
-Santa Claus.

269
00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.840
Santa Claus. exactly. A Norwegian

270
00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:00.880
with a white beard and a red jacket
that is clearly too tight for him.

271
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.680
And why did we refuse?

272
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.160
Because Gaspar said
that was embracing capitalism

273
00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.680
and that marketing was a social farce.

274
00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.200
-It kind of is.
-Here we go again.

275
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.200
-It's true. It is.
-True? No. it's not.

276
00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:17.240
You can't say that
and then do a documentary. Gaspar.

277
00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.720
-We said no at the time.
-You said it.

278
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.560
-No. We said...
-We said it collectively.

279
00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.680
Collectively? What do you mean?

280
00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.280
-Is this a collective thing too?
-Come on!

281
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.600
You're always in a dichotomy.
"I said. but I didn't say."

282
00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.320
"I'll explain." but you don't.

283
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.960
You're never happy. If it's not marketing.

284
00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.840
it's the documentary... Look.

285
00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.520
Own up to your mistakes. Gaspar.

286
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:42.440
As always. you get up and just leave
without facing the issues.

287
00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.080
-That's not true!
-You never do.

288
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.400
For God's sake!

289
00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.800
-Come back here and listen!
-I don't want to talk.

290
00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.840
-Don't run away.
-I'm not talking to you!

291
00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.240
-Every time...
-Not true.

292
00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.600
-...we bring this up...
-What a shame.

293
00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:58.120
I want my pill box.

294
00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.800
This is distasteful.

295
00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.480
They get along fine.

296
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.600
Sometimes they argue. but...

297
00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.160
But they're okay.

298
00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.360
More or less.

299
00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.400
Santa Claus does
commendable work. a very good job.

300
00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:34.240
He doesn't do the work himself.
but he's a good manager.

301
00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.480
Yes. we love him.

302
00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:41.840
We love his reindeers. his elves...

303
00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:48.600
This is not a competition.
No one needs to win over the other.

304
00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.280
In the end. we're all here
for the same reason.

305
00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.800
-For the children. right?
-That's true.

306
00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:01.200
Isn't it? The best example
is my daughter Sofía. Come here.

307
00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:06.000
Sofía. you get presents
from the Three Wise Kings and Santa Claus.

308
00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.840
-Yes.
-And there's no problem. right?

309
00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.160
-What problem? No.
-Is something wrong?

310
00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.760
-No.
-Nothing's wrong.

311
00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:16.120
Nothing's wrong. Very well.

312
00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.920
-I like Santa Claus.
-There's nothing wrong with that.

313
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.960
but you also like
the Three Wise Kings. don't you?

314
00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:27.680
Yeah. well... I like them...

315
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.680
But their clothes smell funny.
as if they'd been stored for a long time.

316
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.280
And Santa Claus brings
his presents earlier.

317
00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:49.880
DECEMBER 10TH
26 DAYS UNTIL THE PARADE

318
00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.520
Your Majesties!

319
00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.760
Are you ready for today's event?

320
00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:21.600
More than ready.
One for all and all for one.

321
00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.600
-Yes.
-We're doing great.

322
00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:27.680
Where's Sofía?

323
00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.520
-Sofía?
-Yes.

324
00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.240
She doesn't like us either?

325
00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.520
Sofía's at school.

326
00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.720
She said she can't wait
to go to the mall today.

327
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:49.600
There'll be tons of kids
excited to see you.

328
00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:57.000
Besides. her letter is almost ready.
You'll get it in a few days.

329
00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:02.440
Here come the Magi
Here come the Magi

330
00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.720
All together!

331
00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.640
On their way to Bethlehem

332
00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.560
Hurray. hurray. the star and hurray

333
00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.320
The star is in sight

334
00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.760
Only Gaspar now!

335
00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:17.280
There it is. there it is
The star is in sight

336
00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.360
Baltasar!

337
00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:22.760
Bearing toys
Bearing toys

338
00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:27.960
To entertain the child
Hurray. hurray. the star and hurray

339
00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.360
Only Melchor now!

340
00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.760
I won't sing. I don't like singing.

341
00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.440
Let alone because Olga asks me to.

342
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.240
Lola.

343
00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.200
Lola.

344
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:51.720
Enjoy this Christmas more than ever
by saving with all our products.

345
00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.440
-Hey. it's the Three Wise Kings.
-Don't you want...

346
00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.320
Don't you want to ask
the Magi for anything?

347
00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:08.240
No. thank you.

348
00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.400
-You sure?
-I'm sure.

349
00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.400
They are the mysterious
Three Wise Kings from the East.

350
00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.560
No. I want to see Inmagic.

351
00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.800
-Who?
-A famous streamer. She's upstairs.

352
00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.760
Okay. Thanks. Bye.

353
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.880
ROYAL

354
00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.040
-What's this?
-What?

355
00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.440
What's this?

356
00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.160
I don't know...

357
00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:37.200
Only one card. that is no more and no less

358
00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.960
than the five of spades.

359
00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.440
INMAGIC
RECORDING HER NEW SHOW

360
00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.520
Performing magic tricks with new cards

361
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.160
Okay. Now...

362
00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:50.040
Look. We're taking this. That's it.

363
00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.440
Let's shuffle.

364
00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:54.720
Now look.

365
00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.840
Sorry.

366
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:02.720
Look. I'll introduce myself.
My name is Lola.

367
00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:07.880
Sorry. It'll be just a minute.
I'm the manager

368
00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:12.680
of the Three Wise Kings.
and they have booked us on the same day.

369
00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.760
Where? That way? Okay.

370
00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.760
-Yes. thank you.
-You're welcome.

371
00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.400
-Mom. can I have the phone?
-Yes.

372
00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.800
-What's your name. sweetheart?
-Inmagic.

373
00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.040
Inmagic.

374
00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.680
You're Inmaculada Quesada. from Lucena.

375
00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.640
-You were a pain for Ms. Jimena...
-What?

376
00:24:55.720 --> 00:25:00.160
your elementary school teacher.
You were always obsessed with magic.

377
00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.480
Yes. Actually.
Santa Claus brought me a magic box.

378
00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.800
Of course. Santa Claus. who else?

379
00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.840
Want to meet the Three Wise Kings? No?

380
00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.920
You can leave your letters in there.

381
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.760
-In the royal mailbox.
-The royal mailbox. yes.

382
00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.120
There are lots of letters. you know?

383
00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.000
Don't be left behind.

384
00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.800
Look. would you like to sit with Baltasar?

385
00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.400
Very well. Hello.

386
00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.920
-Hi.
-What's your name?

387
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.440
-Damián.
-Great. Now tell me.

388
00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.880
-have you been a good boy?
-Yes.

389
00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.840
-And what would you like?
-A selfie.

390
00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:36.160
We'll do it in a minute. but do you want
a bike or a video game console?

391
00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.880
I want a selfie with Inmagic.

392
00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:41.400
-A what?
-I want a selfie with Inmagic!

393
00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:45.680
Look. you can sit in there with Gaspar.

394
00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.840
-Hi.
-Hello.

395
00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:01.800
Thank you.

396
00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:03.920
The letters.

397
00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.560
What's up?

398
00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:09.600
-I love your hat!
-Yes. it's great. Really great.

399
00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.360
They won't bring you the gifts otherwise.

400
00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:16.120
What?

401
00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.000
I was joking. They will bring them.

402
00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.400
Hi.

403
00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.440
Thank you.

404
00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:29.440
The rivers are murky
The rivers are murky

405
00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:34.320
And you can't drink the water
Hurray. hurray. the star and hurray

406
00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:40.200
The star is in sight
There it is. there it is

407
00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:45.640
Here come the Magi
Here come the Magi

408
00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:50.320
On their way to Bethlehem
Hurray. hurray. the star and hurray

409
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.520
The star is in sight

410
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.320
It went badly. It went badly.

411
00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.720
It went very badly. it's true.

412
00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.240
But tomorrow

413
00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:17.520
we have a meeting
with a communications agency.

414
00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.280
and they will help us.

415
00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:32.520
DECEMBER 15TH
21 DAYS UNTIL THE PARADE

416
00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:40.920
Hello. we have an appointment
at the advertising agency.

417
00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:44.320
Your ID cards?

418
00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.920
-Our what?
-Your identification.

419
00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.000
-You were carrying them.
-No.

420
00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.800
-I gave it to you. with the keys.
-What keys?

421
00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:13.480
Good afternoon.

422
00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.840
-Good afternoon. welcome.
-Hello.

423
00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.720
-Matías.
-Estela.

424
00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.200
-Pleased to meet you.
-Pleased to meet you.

425
00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:22.360
Matías.

426
00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.360
Okay. Majesties. if you please.

427
00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.640
let's make a brand analysis.

428
00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.520
MATÍAS CARMONA
ADVERTISING CREATIVE

429
00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:39.280
The Three Wise Kings are a legacy brand.
a very powerful brand.

430
00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.600
You're huge
in the child gift industry. right?

431
00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:45.240
A traditional. national
and well-established brand.

432
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.600
Exactly.

433
00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.120
But you also have...

434
00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.720
ESTELA POZZOLI
IMAGE CONSULTANT

435
00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.640
...some structural weaknesses.

436
00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:58.280
Minimal ones. What are those weak spots?

437
00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.600
You're receiving fewer letters
every year. right?

438
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.680
-Because there are fewer children.
-Fewer what?

439
00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:12.000
-Fewer children.
-And the kids are focused

440
00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:14.680
-on cell phones. tablets...
-Of course.

441
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.960
They stop being kids too soon.

442
00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:23.800
The Chinese word for "crisis."
which you can see here. means

443
00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:28.120
-"opportunity."
-We have a huge opportunity.

444
00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:32.120
An incredible opportunity.
and we have to seize it.

445
00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.720
We're proposing
a much more aggressive strategy.

446
00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:36.920
Boom!

447
00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.080
Internet. social media...

448
00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.760
-You follow me?
-Yes.

449
00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.080
Guys?

450
00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.320
And also.

451
00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:55.240
going forward we can
make even more changes.

452
00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.240
Because. well. three men...

453
00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.160
-Hello? 21st century.
-Hello?

454
00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.080
-Hello? Diversity.
-Hello?

455
00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:06.400
Wait a moment. The feminist issue...

456
00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.520
That's different.

457
00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:13.120
But you're not inclusive.
you're not diverse.

458
00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.600
You are a bit. but not too much.

459
00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.320
Thanks for the compliment.

460
00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:22.400
Could we rethink the parade?

461
00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:27.200
I mean. going around a city with camels.
giving candy to children...

462
00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:29.600
-It's unnecessary.
-It's unhealthy.

463
00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.400
But... What do you want to do?

464
00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:39.560
Are you ready to hear some new ideas?

465
00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:49.080
In life. sometimes. changes are good.

466
00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:51.640
because they make us evolve.

467
00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:56.280
Like when there is an earthquake
and all the houses tremble

468
00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:58.040
and the crappy ones fall down...

469
00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:01.840
And then you can rebuild.

470
00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:04.680
I mean...

471
00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:09.120
And nobody dies.
In my example. nobody dies.

472
00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.360
Everyone makes it out alive.

473
00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:16.680
Like the Three Wise Kings now.
They are reviving.

474
00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.480
I mean. they...
The Three Wise Kings aren't dead.

475
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.880
But they do need a change.

476
00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:28.480
DECEMBER 17TH
19 DAYS UNTIL THE PARADE

477
00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:36.960
Good morning! We're starting our day
with strength. with energy.

478
00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.000
-Good morning.
-Morning!

479
00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:46.120
-Who is she?
-Azucena. from the agency.

480
00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.200
Hi.

481
00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.520
-The nutritionist.
-Where's our breakfast?

482
00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:54.400
Nothing. All the fat. all the sugar...
It's got to go.

483
00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:58.560
We need to change your eating habits.

484
00:31:58.640 --> 00:31:59.960
To look like you. right?

485
00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:03.080
You want to change and feel better
with yourselves. right?

486
00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.160
ALMUDENA CID
ATHLETE

487
00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.960
To be more confident.
And for that you also need

488
00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:09.320
a healthy and well-balanced diet.

489
00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:13.320
Look. the thing is we're used to...

490
00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:17.360
oatmeal. goat milk.

491
00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.920
lamb jerky. unleavened bread...

492
00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.960
This has caught us off-guard.

493
00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:30.000
It's good. Without a doubt.

494
00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.760
But it's hard to stop

495
00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:37.040
-eating strong cheese.
-There's no wine?

496
00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:41.800
No. We need to eat well.
to work on our bodies.

497
00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.400
Develop some muscles.
You're lacking muscle.

498
00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:46.840
A bit of work.

499
00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:49.720
Is it good?

500
00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:51.760
-Exquisite.
-It is. right?

501
00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.640
-Yes.
-How are your bowel movements?

502
00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.640
Cereals are good.
You can put some in the yogurt.

503
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.840
I'd rather eat these chunks first.
then I'll add the rest.

504
00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:06.000
-What's this?
-Corn cakes.

505
00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:09.280
I just... Really. it's...

506
00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.920
I'm already feeling it. I'm much more...

507
00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.400
-Healthy.
-No. light.

508
00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:16.360
-That's healthy.
-Excuse me?

509
00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:18.480
-Healthy. Yeah.
-Healthy. sure.

510
00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:21.400
I'm getting up. because...
This was delicious.

511
00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.520
Thank you very much. Azucena. And...

512
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.600
It was all delicious.

513
00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.480
-Almudena.
-Almudena. sure.

514
00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.800
He hasn't eaten much. But it's a step.

515
00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.680
Your palate has to gradually adapt.

516
00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:43.040
-Boiled.
-It's better without the yolk.

517
00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:47.080
-Do you play any sport. Sofía?
-I dance flamenco.

518
00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:50.600
Flamenco! "Grab an apple.
eat it and throw it." Yeah?

519
00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:54.720
-And some rhythmic gymnastics.
-Can you do this?

520
00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:56.960
-No.
-No?

521
00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.200
-Step-by-step.
-I can teach you.

522
00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:02.640
-Without breaking my leg.
-Don't worry. I never break anyone's.

523
00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.280
-She's silly.
-So cute.

524
00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:07.560
-Well.
-Okay.

525
00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.480
Okay. let's go.

526
00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:09.920
-See you.
-Later.

527
00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:14.239
Okay. guys. let's warm up a little.

528
00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:18.560
-To avoid muscle pulls.
-The thing is. this sport isn't really...

529
00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:22.400
-Okay. let's...
-How long will this take?

530
00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:26.120
-Like an hour and a half. Not much more.
-Okay.

531
00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:30.239
Are we getting in the water or...

532
00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:33.800
Of course.
Otherwise. we'd have gone somewhere else.

533
00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.560
-Of course.
-Okay. let's begin. all right?

534
00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:39.920
-Okay.
-Yes? You okay?

535
00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:42.679
-Yes.
-Okay. Let's continue.

536
00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:47.280
We've come here to work. Okay.
Ear to the shoulder. One and two.

537
00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:51.360
One and two.
If you smile. it's much better.

538
00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:54.600
One. two. Can you drop your arms. Melchor?

539
00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:58.240
-Relax.
-I'm more relaxed like this.

540
00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.200
My God... Up. release.

541
00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:05.920
Up. release. Now forward.
One and two. Release.

542
00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.640
Up and release.

543
00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:11.440
-Okay. now we'll go up...
-Almudena. one more thing.

544
00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:13.800
-There will be some stunts.
-What?

545
00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.760
-You're going to show me them?
-Yes.

546
00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:16.800
Here?

547
00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.160
Which ones?

548
00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.960
-Stunts.
-Side wheels?

549
00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.960
-Somersaults?
-Yes.

550
00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:29.240
-Sounds like you're saying "to Croatia."
-To Croatia.

551
00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:32.520
-"To Croatia."
-You thought he was saying "to Croatia."

552
00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.080
You couldn't understand.

553
00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:37.000
Let's go to Croatia. sure.
This is something.

554
00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.720
To Croatia...

555
00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.200
Okay. you don't need
to move the whole body.

556
00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:45.680
just your hips. Only your hips.

557
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:46.920
Cannonball!

558
00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.320
Let's use the noodles a little bit.

559
00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:03.520
One noodle here. One for Gaspar.

560
00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:07.760
One for Baltasar. Strong abdomen.

561
00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.760
Come on! You can do it.
Come on. use the noodle!

562
00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.640
Good! There it is! Almost.

563
00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:20.680
-What's wrong?
-What happened?

564
00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.600
-A spasm.
-Melchor.

565
00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.320
When did it happen?

566
00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.080
-Doing the...
-With the noodle?

567
00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:30.000
-The rope jumping.
-But you're not jumping here.

568
00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.880
there's no gravity.

569
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.080
Are you okay?

570
00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.680
I knew it...

571
00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:40.640
-I don't get how could he hurt himself.
-You'll be okay in a minute.

572
00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:43.000
At some point I was feeling...

573
00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:47.600
-You know? Like...
-I think you should sit down.

574
00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:52.880
-Sit down.
-I don't get it.

575
00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.560
You're trembling.
That's because you're not moving.

576
00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:58.440
Do some laps. I want to see you. Come on.

577
00:36:58.640 --> 00:36:59.920
Come on. let's go.

578
00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:04.000
Once back. you'll have stopped trembling.

579
00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:07.040
Get to the end. dear!

580
00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:13.360
-Of course. You'll soon get over it.
-It's true.

581
00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.200
It hurts a lot.

582
00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.400
Get to where Sofía is!

583
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.120
For instance. we have Carla Blanes.
Seven years old. from Mataró. Barcelona.

584
00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.520
She's asking

585
00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.360
for a bike and a costume. Okay...

586
00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.960
ALBERTO FERNÁNDEZ
IT TECHNICIAN

587
00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:30.160
Let's see what the algorithm tells us.

588
00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:34.840
Okay. She's been very good in math class.

589
00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:39.040
but... She hits her brother too much.

590
00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:41.360
So the algorithm says...

591
00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:48.240
No bike. This year. a book. pajamas.
and you're good to go. Carla Blanes.

592
00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:52.960
The computer makes the decision?

593
00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:57.200
Yes. Well.
you have to click one last time.

594
00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:59.960
Then the order is sent to the pages.

595
00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.640
so they can pick up
the gifts from the warehouse.

596
00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:06.640
So. from now on. our job is

597
00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:10.280
to press a button three times
with a finger. is that it?

598
00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:19.040
DECEMBER 20TH
16 DAYS UNTIL THE PARADE

599
00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.480
The Magi have never
brought me anything. I don't like them.

600
00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:23.560
SOCIAL MEDIA EXPERT

601
00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.680
There's three of them. that's weird.

602
00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:28.280
Why three guys to bring a gift to a child?

603
00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.080
And they're too heterosexual.

604
00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:34.520
The Olentzero is more of a queer icon.

605
00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:38.360
He's nice. And there's a tradition
in the Basque Country.

606
00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:42.560
where we make an Olentzero effigy
and then burn it.

607
00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.040
Basque people.

608
00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:51.920
Okay. new words:
Twitter. Instagram. Facebook.

609
00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:54.320
Grindr. LinkedIn.

610
00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:58.400
Nobody asks for gifts on LinkedIn.
but perhaps on Grindr they will.

611
00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:01.480
Excuse me. but I didn't understand a word.

612
00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:04.640
-We now have profiles on gay sites.
-What?

613
00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:06.600
Way sites.

614
00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:07.760
Websites.

615
00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.280
Yes. but that's not it.

616
00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:14.320
They're social networks
where people say things.

617
00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:17.280
But don't take seriously
anything they say to you.

618
00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:20.040
-People are frustrated.
-What will they say to us?

619
00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:23.680
We're the Three Wise Kings.
our job is to give presents.

620
00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:28.960
A lot of stuff. They'll say
you're old. that you dress poorly.

621
00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:33.720
that you're misogynist.
that you haven't changed in 20 centuries.

622
00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:38.600
And going everywhere on a camel...
That's animal cruelty.

623
00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:43.720
-Come on. cruelty...
-Nowadays. it's a leading social cause.

624
00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:47.640
Just listen to her.
She's the one who knows.

625
00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:51.840
Go like this.

626
00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:01.520
You'd see my cousins
with their Scalextric. skis. skateboards.

627
00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:06.200
Monopoly... And I got a book
called Il cartello fra...

628
00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:07.880
LORENZO CAPRILE
FASHION DESIGNER

629
00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:11.960
Carlo III... Carlo I di Napoli...
Carlo III di Spagna...

630
00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:15.440
And his gardener or architect Sabatini.

631
00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:19.200
A book this huge. a real bore.
Besides. in Italian.

632
00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.720
And I said. "Thank you."
but I was thinking.

633
00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:26.200
"Screw Christmas. this is unfair."

634
00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:31.160
We'll put you in something
to fill you out a bit. you're too skinny.

635
00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:33.520
Do you have a shirt. Antonio?

636
00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.320
The fabric is very airy.

637
00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:40.320
That way you won't be too hot.
No. we had a shirt. I think.

638
00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.120
Don't you like light clothing?

639
00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:48.360
You have to travel lots of kilometers.
This will help.

640
00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:51.200
Can you make it alive with that body?

641
00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:53.320
Horrible. Here.

642
00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:59.560
In the nativity scene we had back home.
you were a bit more...

643
00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.600
important. let's say.

644
00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:06.080
-Whatever.
-It's tight in my armholes.

645
00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:07.560
We'll fix that.

646
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.400
You're so skinny
and it's tight in the armholes... Well...

647
00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.800
Reality is always disappointing.

648
00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:21.520
Look. I don't think so.

649
00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:25.240
Man. You're a vision.

650
00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:28.640
You're fantastic.
You look like Princess Elena.

651
00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.600
And this little bow is so cute.

652
00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.160
Look...

653
00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.920
Lorenzo. we're sorry.

654
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.800
Why? That incident is in the past now.

655
00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:41.800
But I did want to dress you up.

656
00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:45.640
It doesn't seem to be in the past.
I'm sorry about your cousins.

657
00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:48.640
There was something embroidered.
Let's give it more...

658
00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.680
-I understand the crowns.
-more volume.

659
00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:53.680
-But does it have to be this headdress?
-Of course.

660
00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.760
That way you're visible.
You have to travel the world.

661
00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:58.880
That way they'll see you.

662
00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:01.800
-It's itchy.
-Suck it up.

663
00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.040
Stand together. Not bad.

664
00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.080
Not bad.

665
00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:18.120
ROCÍO HARADA
FASHION PHOTOGRAPHER

666
00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:21.000
Hi. How are you?

667
00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:25.880
Baltasar. get in the middle.
and closer to the camera.

668
00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:28.240
-Here?
-Yes.

669
00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:31.800
And you...

670
00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:35.840
Gaspar. two steps to your left.

671
00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:40.400
-And the pink one. a bit more...
-Melchor.

672
00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.520
Melchor. that's it. Melchor.

673
00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.960
Further back. look to your right.

674
00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.320
-Further back.
-But...

675
00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:51.920
To my right? The camera is right there.

676
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.560
-Relax. you'll be in the photo. Two steps.
-But...

677
00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.480
-But I will look confused.
-Just...

678
00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:57.680
Trust me.

679
00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:00.840
-A little further.
-I'll look like an idiot.

680
00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:02.960
I must be here.

681
00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:06.600
It's normal. guys. don't worry.

682
00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.280
Why do you smile?

683
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.200
We're the Three Wise Kings.

684
00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:14.200
-We bring joy...
-Have you never seen a promotional still?

685
00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:18.960
What you need to do
is connect with your inner pain. Okay?

686
00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:20.400
-Okay.
-Fantastic.

687
00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.160
Back to your position. please.

688
00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:28.280
Do you think we could
promote this on TikTok?

689
00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:31.680
Perhaps they could dance.
With a song by Rosalía.

690
00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.560
Your inner pain is that way.

691
00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:34.800
-No.
-No.

692
00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:37.000
Old men dancing are cringy.

693
00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:40.040
-Right.
-It's embarrassing.

694
00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:41.840
Yes. a bit embarrassing.

695
00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:44.160
No hands.

696
00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.160
-Who? Him?
-Yes. you're doing great.

697
00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:48.520
-Great?
-It's like I'm doing magic...

698
00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:53.440
-Your faces will be all over the city.
-Like this?

699
00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.240
-A little to your right.
-Too close?

700
00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:58.880
Am I not too close?

701
00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:01.880
-So my image is great?
-It's okay. There.

702
00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.840
Enough. I want this too.

703
00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:07.360
Please. guys.
You can get the inner pain look

704
00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:10.520
by thinking you haven't turned off
the gas back home.

705
00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:14.000
-She only cares about Baltasar.
-No problem.

706
00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:15.680
Don't get nervous. It's fine.

707
00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:18.800
Two more steps. You stay still.

708
00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:20.560
-There?
-There.

709
00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:23.920
No smile. There.

710
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.320
-That look.
-You like that. don't you?

711
00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:29.000
My gaze communicates a lot.

712
00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:31.440
Look at me.

713
00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:45.160
-Another sprain?
-What?

714
00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:48.560
-Did you sprain your leg again?
-No.

715
00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:53.400
I'm not in the picture.
that's the problem.

716
00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:57.760
Which I don't care about.
But since they dress me up like this.

717
00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:59.480
I might as well be in it.

718
00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.480
Think about it.

719
00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:09.040
Do you really want
to be in the picture dressed like that?

720
00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:12.600
No.

721
00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:16.960
-You don't look great.
-Are you making fun of me?

722
00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:19.040
-Are you making fun of me?
-No.

723
00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:20.920
-You're laughing at me.
-With you.

724
00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.320
You're laughing at me.

725
00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:24.520
You think I look like an idiot.

726
00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:26.480
-Don't make fun of me.
-No...

727
00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:30.240
I can laugh if I want to.
but don't you laugh at my clothes.

728
00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:32.400
Guys. please.

729
00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:40.640
Gosh. they sure are taking this seriously.

730
00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:47.320
DECEMBER 25TH
11 DAYS UNTIL THE PARADE

731
00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:50.720
-Sofía. be careful today.
-Why?

732
00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:54.520
Because Santa Claus is here today.

733
00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:57.480
and the Magi may be a little touchy.

734
00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:01.320
I mean. they get along well.
but he's still their competition.

735
00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:06.400
Look. just tell them
it was a gift from Aunt Asun. Okay?

736
00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:09.000
Okay.

737
00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:13.000
Why don't you write your letter
to the Three Wise Kings?

738
00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:16.800
-I already have gifts from Santa Claus.
-You'll get more.

739
00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:21.680
Mom. no. Making so many toys
pollutes the environment

740
00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:24.400
-and encourages communism.
-Consumerism.

741
00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:26.040
Right.

742
00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:28.840
-Did they teach you that in school?
-Yes.

743
00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:31.680
These kids...

744
00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:34.280
They're the best thing in the world.

745
00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:39.560
-But you need to write that letter. Okay?
-Fine. I'll write it.

746
00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:48.760
Santa Claus. the man most beloved
and most awaited by children.

747
00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:52.440
passed through last night
bringing lots of gifts. hope and joy.

748
00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:55.760
Kids awoke this morning
to find their stockings filled

749
00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:57.720
with their favorite toys...

750
00:46:58.080 --> 00:46:59.520
It's too low.

751
00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:03.120
...and their favorite clothes.
Of all the days of the year...

752
00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:07.040
Those chocolate bars
are terrible for your stomach.

753
00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:13.880
There's a fake Baltasar.
He posts stuff saying he's me.

754
00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:15.400
What's wrong with him?

755
00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:18.000
They insult him thinking it's me.

756
00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:20.920
-Your job is to give away toys.
-Precisely. Look.

757
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.520
Soriano73 thinks I should give
the same gifts to everyone

758
00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.920
-to promote equality.
-Okay.

759
00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:30.960
Look at this one.
RodríguezB@ thinks I give too many gifts.

760
00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:34.120
so children don't make any effort
and become weak. Look.

761
00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:37.240
He says they were happier playing
with a stick and a stone.

762
00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:40.640
-How can they be happier with a stone?
-That's what I think. But...

763
00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:43.320
But wait. they say more things about you.

764
00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:44.680
Leave me out of it.

765
00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:47.080
-Majesties!
-I don't want to know.

766
00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:52.880
Majesties. how are you?

767
00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:56.240
I have a surprise for you.

768
00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:00.080
A big surprise.

769
00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:04.000
Thanks. I'll just...

770
00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:06.680
Come. Sofía.

771
00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:08.440
Sofía!

772
00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:15.080
-Yes?
-What's that toy?

773
00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:17.320
It's a toy.

774
00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:23.480
But I would not recommend it.
you wouldn't like it.

775
00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:36.800
This is a first idea. okay?
They sent it so we could tell them

776
00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:40.640
what we like.
if there are any issues. whatever.

777
00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:43.520
The first float will be a concert.

778
00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:47.360
We're calling Sebastián Yatra.
C. Tangana. Camilo.

779
00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:50.280
and Zzoilo. okay?
And that's just the list of men.

780
00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:53.120
The list of women is infinitely...

781
00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.600
-greater.
-Wonderful!

782
00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.120
-You don't know who they are.
-No.

783
00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:02.520
-But if you tell me. I'll search...
-No.

784
00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:06.800
No need. They're like... Julio Iglesias.

785
00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:10.240
-But in tracksuits.
-Excuse me?

786
00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:11.800
In tracksuits?

787
00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:14.800
They'll introduce us in tracksuits?

788
00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:16.720
What matters is that people see you.

789
00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:19.520
-But seeing us in tracksuits...
-No...

790
00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:21.920
They can wear tracksuits. we won't.

791
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.040
-You don't need to.
-We'll dress normal.

792
00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:25.520
You can wear what you want.

793
00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:30.400
The tracksuit...
Forget it. The thing is...

794
00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:35.600
What we do need for sure
is Gaspar's magic.

795
00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:38.800
Suddenly. you're there.

796
00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:42.720
the three of you. on the float. like...

797
00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:44.760
I don't know. Like The Beatles. and...

798
00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:49.720
You disappear. In a cloud of dust.

799
00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:51.720
That magic.

800
00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:00.640
Perhaps... you could fly away.

801
00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:08.800
Gaspar is feeling
a bit insecure and nervous

802
00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:12.080
because his magic isn't working.
So he's eating a lot.

803
00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:14.760
then he feels sick.
and his magic is even worse...

804
00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:18.240
Like the snake that bites its tail.
But no problem. there's time.

805
00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:20.960
We still have 11 days to the parade.

806
00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:24.600
So there's lots of time.
It will all work out fine.

807
00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:07.800
We really love Gaspar.
We want to make that clear from the start.

808
00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:15.000
But we're worried. because he's...

809
00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:17.720
overexcited.

810
00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:21.240
-He's a good person.
-Yes. I don't want to talk...

811
00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:25.720
He's a kind person.
he's always there for you...

812
00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:30.080
He is. but he stops being there when...

813
00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:33.080
Look. magic is not an exact science.

814
00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:39.840
You can't just do a magic trick
whenever you're asked to do one.

815
00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:41.440
Magic...

816
00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:44.400
is very capricious.

817
00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:49.120
It's magic.

818
00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:56.000
Cicadas.

819
00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:05.440
See?

820
00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:09.360
It's capricious.

821
00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:13.360
-Four. five. six.
-I have it here.

822
00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:15.040
-Read it.
-"What's the title

823
00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:20.720
"of the last album by David Bowie.
released two days before his death?"

824
00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:25.560
-She doesn't know.
-Quiet!

825
00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:27.320
-You don't know.
-Quiet.

826
00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:32.480
-Don't tell her.
-I haven't.

827
00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:33.600
-You did.
-No.

828
00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:35.480
-Enough. Your turn.
-I know it!

829
00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:36.800
-Cheater!
-Your turn.

830
00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:39.120
You know too much. You're 2.000 years old.

831
00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:41.680
-Then don't play.
-It's unfair.

832
00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:43.240
-It's unfair.
-My turn.

833
00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:46.400
-Three.
-Another one. I'll read it.

834
00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:48.080
-I'll read it.
-Come on.

835
00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:52.440
Hey! Have you seen these filters?
They can transform your face.

836
00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:56.200
Cat filter. butterfly. fish...
It never ends.

837
00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:58.600
-You can be whoever you like.
-I know.

838
00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:01.560
I think you're becoming addicted
to that stuff.

839
00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:03.920
You can also let us play. Come on.

840
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:04.920
Okay.

841
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.040
-She has to read the question.
-Read.

842
00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:24.760
-I don't know how to...
-Don't worry.

843
00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:32.600
Okay.

844
00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:36.800
-She drooled all over my shoulder.
-I'm sorry. Okay...

845
00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:40.120
-Bye. See you tomorrow.
-Good night.

846
00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:42.840
-See you on Monday.
-See you on Monday. And thanks.

847
00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:54.760
-Very nice. right?
-Yes.

848
00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:59.000
-What is?
-The marketing campaign.

849
00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:03.320
the parade. the singers in tracksuits...
It's a good idea. right?

850
00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:05.040
-Yes.
-Tracksuit?

851
00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:07.280
-Well...
-Yes.

852
00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:09.960
Good night.

853
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.080
Yes. Good night.

854
00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:15.120
Good night.

855
00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:26.280
If you want.

856
00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:28.680
you can sleep

857
00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:33.520
in the stable. It's warm.
We have no room inside.

858
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.840
DECEMBER 30TH
6 DAYS UNTIL THE PARADE

859
00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:42.920
There they are. They're here.

860
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.080
Hello.

861
00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:46.240
How are you? Lola.

862
00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:48.280
-Good morning.
-Hi.

863
00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:50.160
-Hello.
-How are you. Lola?

864
00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:52.720
-Sergio. the choreographer.
-How are you?

865
00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:55.480
-Hi. Sergio. I'm Lola.
-Hi. Nice to meet you.

866
00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:56.760
-Hi. guys.
-Hello.

867
00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:57.680
Sorry.

868
00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:00.640
-The choreographer.
-Pleased to meet you. Dancers.

869
00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:01.880
Melchor and Gaspar.

870
00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:03.400
-Looking forward to it?
-Yes.

871
00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:04.840
SERGIO ALCOVER
CHOREOGRAPHER

872
00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:06.760
How are your dancing skills?

873
00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:08.040
-Great.
-Great.

874
00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:13.000
-Hello.
-Hi! How are you?

875
00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:15.920
-It's great to see you!
-You too.

876
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.560
-You're looking great.
-Thanks.

877
00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:19.120
Okay. should I introduce you?

878
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.400
-Sir. how are you?
-Hi.

879
00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:24.080
-Glad to meet you.
-Baltasar.

880
00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:27.160
-I know. I'm Sergio. The dancers.
-He's so eccentric.

881
00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:28.640
-Hi!
-What's up?

882
00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:31.520
Baltasar. I want you to meet Rozalén.

883
00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:32.520
ROZALÉN
SINGER

884
00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:34.960
-She wants to meet you.
-Excited to meet you.

885
00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:39.440
You're my favorite Wise King.
Can I take a picture for social media?

886
00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:41.400
-Social media?
-Yes. please.

887
00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:44.600
Thank you very much. I really admire you.

888
00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:47.840
There.

889
00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:53.560
Thank you very much. Thank you. So cool!

890
00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:56.000
Look...

891
00:55:56.120 --> 00:56:00.200
-Sorry. I have to go to the bathroom.
-Okay.

892
00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:02.040
Baltasar.

893
00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:04.560
I think Baltasar...

894
00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:11.480
This is too much for him.

895
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.160
He's like a little kid.

896
00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:18.840
This is going to his head.

897
00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:22.880
-The cameras...
-Yeah. he likes...

898
00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:24.280
I don't know.

899
00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:26.000
But well. I'm not...

900
00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:29.560
I would never speak ill of him.

901
00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:34.200
Do you have nail clippers?

902
00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:40.880
One. two. change. change. down. And up.

903
00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:43.400
Okay? Again. One. two. three...

904
00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:45.480
Why are you looking at the floor?

905
00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:48.960
Stop. Don't look up either.

906
00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:51.120
We'll start from the beginning.

907
00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:53.720
You do the leg movement. then the arms.

908
00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:57.040
You need to add this to the leg thing.

909
00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:59.640
Again. Twice. Five. six. seven.

910
00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:02.200
One. two. three. four.

911
00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:04.280
Five. six. seven and...

912
00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:06.560
Eight. And one. two.

913
00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:08.760
three. four. Again. Five. six.

914
00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:10.840
Wait. I'm going crazy.

915
00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:13.600
-There are two choreographies.
-I missed the eight.

916
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.840
Okay. We have to try at the same time.

917
00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:19.360
Again. all right?

918
00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:23.280
Five. six. seven and... One. two.

919
00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:27.640
three. four. Five. six.
Impossible. And eight. And one.

920
00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:30.440
two. three and four. five. six.

921
00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:32.920
seven and... We have a problem.

922
00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:36.920
-Will they see his underwear?
-I think they will.

923
00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:41.320
Okay? Yes?

924
00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:44.160
Yes. great.

925
00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:47.200
It's great. It's cool.

926
00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:49.640
Yes. Okay...

927
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.120
I think this won't work.

928
00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:58.000
And down.

929
00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:01.760
Okay? You need to squat all the way down.

930
00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:04.520
And now... No. squatting.

931
00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:07.080
Let's stop for a minute.

932
00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:09.480
I think you're looking good.

933
00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.200
-Please. cover up.
-No. but...

934
00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:14.880
Why are you laughing?

935
00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:17.000
-Some water?
-Can we have water?

936
00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:18.840
He tells us to open our legs...

937
00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:21.080
-I don't get it.
-You're doing great. guys.

938
00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:27.160
-I like it.
-Are you willing to dance with these guys?

939
00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:30.400
-This is for life.
-I don't know. positive reinforcement.

940
00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:34.480
You tell me.
She's the one going on stage with them.

941
00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:36.280
-Yes.
-I prepare the choreography.

942
00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:37.760
but after that...

943
00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:40.520
-With rehearsals. they can pull it off.
-Yes. yes.

944
00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:43.480
Where are they going?

945
00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:45.520
-How are you?
-I'm okay. but let's go.

946
00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:47.400
What happened?

947
00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:52.640
-We're leaving.
-What is he doing?

948
00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:54.600
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

949
00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:57.440
Listen to me.

950
00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:01.160
I'm sorry.

951
00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:04.080
I don't know. all this dancing...

952
00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:05.920
-And social media?
-What?

953
00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:08.560
We could do a TikTok dance.
or a challenge.

954
00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:12.920
-I don't know. The social media stuff...
-He doesn't like social media.

955
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.200
Don't worry. Everything will be okay.

956
00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:18.440
Let's get some air. you can have a coffee.

957
00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:21.120
then everything will look different.

958
00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:25.440
Some more rehearsing
and you'll see it clearly.

959
00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:29.360
Social media is overwhelming
Baltasar a little.

960
00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:33.440
They must have insulted him.
But that's another matter.

961
00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:38.280
I've talked to him. I've calmed him down.
I've told him we'll manage

962
00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:41.840
to do the dance.
because it's all about rehearsing.

963
00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:46.240
There's still four days left
until the parade. More than enough.

964
00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:52.040
I'm not saying he can't do other things...

965
00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:54.640
wonderfully well.

966
00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:00.200
Whatever he does.

967
01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:04.400
But if you're dancing.
don't compare yourself with me.

968
01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:13.280
JANUARY 5TH
9 HOURS UNTIL THE PARADE

969
01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:25.800
Hello.

970
01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:30.200
Come on.

971
01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:41.240
Okay. We're a bit nervous. aren't we?

972
01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:44.160
-Yes.
-But good nervous. like...

973
01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:48.640
Excited. enthusiastic.
because tonight's the big night.

974
01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:51.160
Did you write your letter to the Magi?

975
01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:55.920
-Yes.
-You didn't write it.

976
01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:59.680
-I forgot.
-It's okay.

977
01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.560
We must focus on what's important.

978
01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:09.320
Hi.

979
01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:15.320
Estela.

980
01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:17.800
D-Day.

981
01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.520
Exactly.

982
01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:23.120
It will be awesome. A historical day.

983
01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.920
After all the changes we've made.

984
01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:28.480
after so much synergy...

985
01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:30.400
Come on. Estela.

986
01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.360
-Excuse me. The Majesties?
-Hello.

987
01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.600
Hi.

988
01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:38.880
We'll change all this.

989
01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:43.120
Hello.

990
01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:48.760
-Do you have it?
-Yes.

991
01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:50.560
The post office is not picking up.

992
01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.160
The budget. Baltasar. please.

993
01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:54.760
I need you to sign it.

994
01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:01.240
This magic is really nice.

995
01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:02.720
but what about our IT team?

996
01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:05.160
I mean. what was the point?

997
01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:35.080
-Who's Cardo?
-Ricardo.

998
01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:36.240
Gaspar.

999
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.440
We sent you an email with everything
that needs to be addressed.

1000
01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:45.600
-Didn't you say your magic wasn't working?
-Yes.

1001
01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:51.760
But well. it turns out

1002
01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:56.280
that the smiles and excitement
of all the boys and girls around the globe

1003
01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:58.640
feed the fantasy world.

1004
01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:02.880
What?

1005
01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:08.320
Well... I don't know. really.

1006
01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:11.120
It goes back and forth.

1007
01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:12.400
but it works. right?

1008
01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:16.120
Yes. it works.

1009
01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:23.000
Okay. about the gifts...

1010
01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:26.560
It was an exception.

1011
01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:31.320
Because we were nervous.
It won't happen again.

1012
01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:36.040
It's our routine. In the end.
we've been doing it for a long time.

1013
01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:39.320
It's normal we end up repeating patterns.

1014
01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:43.640
Yes. We did it that way.
Now it'll be different and better.

1015
01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:45.360
We'll stick to the plan.

1016
01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:51.440
This will only bring trendier Wise Kings.

1017
01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:53.680
fresher. more up-to-date.

1018
01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:55.680
Yes. "up-to-date" is the word.

1019
01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:58.680
Wise Kings 1. 2. 3.0.

1020
01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:01.960
1. 2. 3.0.

1021
01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:16.680
What's this?

1022
01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:18.480
Can you help me?

1023
01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:23.560
I guess it's like this.

1024
01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:30.640
It doesn't fit. I don't get it.

1025
01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:32.400
-There.
-You've gained weight.

1026
01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:34.320
How could I?

1027
01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:38.680
There was a box full of buns
above the fridge and it's gone.

1028
01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:42.200
Who knows. I didn't eat those.

1029
01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:44.600
-No?
-No.

1030
01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:47.920
It's itchy!

1031
01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:51.640
On the outside?

1032
01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:26.200
I just... I wanted to give you...

1033
01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:57.400
Hello.

1034
01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:03.520
Hi.

1035
01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:25.280
What does it say?

1036
01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.840
Nothing. she wants a drum set.

1037
01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:35.000
-Nothing else?
-No. just a drum set.

1038
01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:38.640
Well. it also says something about us.

1039
01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.440
Pages on the left. fairies at the back.

1040
01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:06.280
When they're done with your hair.
go into the dressing room.

1041
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.479
Majesties. welcome.
we've been waiting for you.

1042
01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:22.319
Please follow me.
I'll show you where you can get ready.

1043
01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:33.000
You can start setting up here.
I'll be back here.

1044
01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:37.720
If you need anything.
let me know and we'll fix it.

1045
01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:40.680
This... Okay.

1046
01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:12.000
Are you going to use make-up?

1047
01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:14.080
I don't want to.

1048
01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:17.800
They say the lights emphasize our flaws.

1049
01:09:18.359 --> 01:09:22.880
We look like space matadors.
These aren't first century outfits.

1050
01:09:23.399 --> 01:09:25.680
I don't like the candy thing either.

1051
01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:30.200
I understand child obesity
and dental health.

1052
01:09:30.279 --> 01:09:31.800
but it's a pity.

1053
01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.760
Dental health. Come on!

1054
01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:41.080
And the camels? We brought them here
and for what? They're just scenery.

1055
01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:51.520
-It's not like we were that bad.
-Of course not.

1056
01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:15.400
-No.
-Sorry. No. Thanks. but no.

1057
01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:17.920
-Wait.
-Thank you. No. Thank you.

1058
01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:33.040
-Mom. what's going on?
-I don't know.

1059
01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:35.600
This one.

1060
01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:41.040
What's happening?

1061
01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:44.520
Change of plans.

1062
01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:49.800
That's right.

1063
01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:34.400
The sunglasses are in the dressing room.

1064
01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:37.160
I've told you already.
I won't repeat it again.

1065
01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:40.280
-Yes.
-Yes.

1066
01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:44.360
No. What are you doing?

1067
01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:47.320
Where are the new costumes.
what we talked about?

1068
01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:51.600
I know we're a bit rusty.
but this is who we are. and we're cool.

1069
01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:55.680
-We'll do the parade as usual.
-And that's that.

1070
01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:59.360
That's that? But...
What about the musicians?

1071
01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:01.200
All these people have come to work!

1072
01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:03.160
-They can come.
-Of course.

1073
01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:06.120
-Let's go all together. why not?
-Because it'll be weird.

1074
01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:07.880
We're all weird. Estela.

1075
01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:22.280
Hurray!

1076
01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:24.640
Hurray!

1077
01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:30.560
Hurray!

1078
01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:32.320
Hurray!

1079
01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:59.360
What about the new costumes?
And their clothing? And the candy?

1080
01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:02.320
This is like being the manager
of the Marx Brothers.

1081
01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:04.960
Would you like to throw gifts?

1082
01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:08.440
-Be careful not to hit someone in the eye.
-Of course not!

1083
01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:16.960
We're now seeing Melchor.
I don't dislike him.

1084
01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:20.320
-I just prefer the middle one.
-So Melchor's not your favorite.

1085
01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:21.520
-No. Gaspar is.
-Okay.

1086
01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:24.840
He goes unnoticed.
because he's the one in the middle.

1087
01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:28.240
he gets less press...
But he gives just as many gifts.

1088
01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:31.440
-The one I prefer is...
-What about you?

1089
01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:34.720
Baltasar. Because he gets less attention.

1090
01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:36.680
Come on. it's very late.

1091
01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.560
-But it's not a school night.
-But it's late.

1092
01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.800
But the Three Wise Kings are coming.

1093
01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:45.160
But you won't see them.
because nobody ever does.

1094
01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:47.880
Come on. let's go to bed.

1095
01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:54.400
We're going to sleep.

1096
01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:06.040
That's enough. isn't it? I mean...

1097
01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:10.640
I think there's nothing else to tell.

1098
01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:12.320
-Right?
-Cut.

1099
01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:17.080
I can't sleep.

1100
01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:24.640
I'll try to catch the Three Wise Kings.

1101
01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:29.920
I think I heard something.

1102
01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:00.600
Sofía. sweetheart. how are you?

1103
01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:03.680
-I'm good.
-Hi!

1104
01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:06.160
-These cookies are stale.
-They are?

1105
01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:08.640
Yes. Hi.

1106
01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:17.120
Don't tell anyone
you've seen us. all right?

1107
01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:19.720
It's a secret.

1108
01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:20.760
Yes.

1109
01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:23.040
Now go to bed. it's very late.

1110
01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:32.480
SINCE THAT JANUARY.
THE THREE WISE KINGS PROMISED

1111
01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:35.600
TO STAY TRUE TO THEMSELVES
AND HAND OUT GIFTS AS ALWAYS.

1112
01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:38.200
IN FEBRUARY.
GASPAR CREATED A PROFILE ON TIKTOK

1113
01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:40.280
AND A STREAMING CHANNEL.

1114
01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:44.040
HE STILL HASN'T MANAGED TO MAKE THEM WORK.

1115
01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:07.440
Cecilia asks. "Where are
the Three Wise Women?" Good question.

1116
01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:11.640
Where are the Three Wise Women
Ding-dong. ding-dong

1117
01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:15.920
At the bottom of the sea...

1118
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.680
Ask your father. he can tell you.

1119
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.560
Lucía asks.

1120
01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:23.200
"Who brings us gifts on Christmas."

1121
01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:28.080
Who do you think?

1122
01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:31.760
I'll give a gift to Gaspar and Melchor

1123
01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:34.640
so that way we can exchange presents.

1124
01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:38.080
Jimena asks.
"What do you think of Baltasar?"

1125
01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:40.720
That he's a child.

1126
01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:42.480
Huggable.

1127
01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:47.000
Immature.

1128
01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:48.440
Lea asks.

1129
01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:51.800
if the pages have to pay
into Social Security.

1130
01:16:57.160 --> 01:17:00.000
And Lucía asks what I think of Gaspar.

1131
01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:01.960
Gaspar...

1132
01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:08.160
He's like a brother
you sometimes wish you didn't have

1133
01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:09.560
because he's annoying.

1134
01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:12.400
"What do you think of Melchor?"

1135
01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:17.360
He's like a has-been John Wayne.

1136
01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:19.040
That's Santa Claus.

1137
01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:20.920
What's the best part of my job?

1138
01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:25.720
The stable. the garden. the pool...

1139
01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.000
The Porsche.

1140
01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:32.160
And the children.

1141
01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:36.920
Let's not forget about them.
Children are very important in my job.

1142
01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:40.000
Without them. I wouldn't have this empire.

1143
