00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:23.437
- Look. - This is moving too fast.

178
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.357
- Don't start that shit.

179
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.153
I move weight for us.

180
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.553

183
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:37.750
I'm tracking them motherfuckers down.

184
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:41.183
You hear me?

185
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.337
So again. I need you on this.

186
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.687
Tell me you gonna hold me down.

187
00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:47.520

188
00:09:47.603 --> 00:09:48.967
Your brother got hit? - Yeah.

189
00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:50.527

190
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.003
I mean I ain't for sure.

191
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.947
So I'm moving different

192
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.777
And when I do. it's lights out.

193
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.337
- Why you just telling me about this now?

194
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:03.097
They can be out there
looking for you. me or the kids.

195
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.807
- Man. look. - No!

196
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:07.177
Did you even stop to think about this?

197
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.887
- Quit fucking worrying.

198
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:10.507
Nobody's gonna come within two feet of you

199
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:11.527
without me knowing about it.

200
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:12.660
So trust me. we good.

00:10:32.466 --> 00:10:34.297
is keep recruiting good runners

209
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:36.543
to help us move this shit.

210
00:10:36.626 --> 00:10:37.717
Aight?

211
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.237
And remember. this what you wanted. Regina.

212
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.324
Keep it in the family.

00:10:42.407 --> 00:10:44.677
Aight. let's go now. It's time to eat.

214
00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:45.760
- I'm with you baby.

215
00:10:48.276 --> 00:10:50.333
- I'm about to go drop some work off to Al.

216
00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.293
Take this. set up a cup of ounces.

217
00:10:56.207 --> 00:10:58.897
Aight. nothing too big. just a few ounces.

218
00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:00.363
So we can get ebony set up.

219
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.687
- All right. I got you babe.

220
00:11:07.476 --> 00:11:09.309
- Drive safe. Be good.

221
00:11:11.778 --> 00:11:16.278
(Old school hip hop jazz music plays)

222
00:11:33.271 --> 00:11:38.104
(Old school hip hop jazz music continues)

223
00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:13.987
- Things are getting messy out here.

224
00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:15.640
We need to settle down and

225
00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:17.933
be smoother.

226
00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:23.617
- How? When they coming
at us with so much disrespect?

227
00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.447
- Don't worry. I got Fredo out there.

228
00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:28.117
He's checking on things.
get us closer to Mr. Carter

229
00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.427
and his little actions.

230
00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:34.996
- Hey. You got Fredo out
there running all our moves?

231
00:12:35.079 --> 00:12:36.910
You sure he can handle that?

232
00:12:36.993 --> 00:12:39.810
- What you mean by
that? I raised him right.

233
00:12:39.893 --> 00:12:42.157
I built this empire on loyalty.

234
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.034
That includes you and Fredo.

235
00:12:44.117 --> 00:12:47.034
So you get those thoughts
outta your head. okay?

236
00:12:47.117 --> 00:12:50.064
And you just concentrate what you gotta do.

237
00:12:50.147 --> 00:12:52.324
- Look. I'm sorry.

238
00:12:52.407 --> 00:12:53.854
He's my brother and all.

239
00:12:53.937 --> 00:12:57.573
But sometimes blood can be disloyal.

240
00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:01.473
- Well I know my son and I know you.

241
00:13:02.683 --> 00:13:05.444
I have no worries about either one of you.

242
00:13:05.527 --> 00:13:07.687
So you just concentrate
on tracking down Leo

243
00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:10.357
and you let me handle everything else.

244
00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.857
- All right.

245
00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:12.940
I see what I can do.

246
00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:16.747
And I need you to do this for me.

247
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:19.735
I need you to be safe. not in harm's way.

248
00:13:19.818 --> 00:13:20.836
- Okay. - Aight?

249
00:13:20.919 --> 00:13:22.087
- Yeah. I'll be fine.

250
00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:25.290
You be safe out there. And

251
00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:30.780
Son. - Yeah?

252
00:13:32.671 --> 00:13:37.254

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.513
- Love you too. pop.

254

You think you the only one holding nigga?

He's missing and we've been

00:20:47.119 --> 00:20:49.419
- Aight. well look man.
I don't know your son.

409
00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:53.797
What I did hear is my
motherfucking brother got killed.

410
00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.477
I'm starting to think
all this shit connected

411
00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.083
to why your son Leo disappeared and shit.

412
00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:00.277
All this shit got something to do with

413
00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.647
your son Leo disappearance. man.

414
00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:04.567
- Look boss. I don't trust this nigga.

- Who the fuck is you pointing at. Joe?

417

Nigga. fuck I gotta lie to you for?

418
00:21:09.583 --> 00:21:11.857
Ain’t gotta make shit up.

419
00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.057
I stand behind my shit.

420
00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:16.117
And if I did do anything
to you motherfuckers.

421
00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.237
your son. anybody. we wouldn't
even be talking right now.

422
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.920
- What do you know about my son?

423
00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:25.913
- Man look.

424
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:29.947
I think the same two
motherfuckers that grabbed me up

425
00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:32.857

429
00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.105

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:43.867
Both of 'em.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:47.047
But I tell you one thing.

One thing about information.

And he always seem to get it first.

So just chill and play our position.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:42.817

Aight.

488
00:24:12.156 --> 00:24:16.239
(Chill relaxed vibe music plays)

489
00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:38.317

491
00:24:42.064 --> 00:24:44.443

I'm laying that shit down right.

504
00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:18.607

That shit don't set too

And we outta here.

518
00:25:51.404 --> 00:25:54.040
(Car engine revs)

519
00:25:54.123 --> 00:25:58.540
(Chill relaxed vibe music continues)

520
00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.257

- All right. well pace yourself.

525
00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:15.873
This is a marathon. not a sprint.

526
00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:18.697
All right. There's only a
few crews running Baltimore

527
00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:21.547
so we work smart. we work quietly.

528
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:23.557
Keep that shit to a minimum.

529
00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.087
- So who's the big dogs out here?

530
00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:27.040
Like. who's at the top of the list?

531
00:26:27.123 --> 00:26:28.837
- Well we got Mr. Sparks.

532
00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.997
he runs the east side of Baltimore.

533
00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:33.817
We got Mr. Carter running
the West Side of Baltimore.

534
00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:36.877
And his partner west is
one deadly motherfucker.

535
00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.407
So you watch your back with him.

536
00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:39.877
- Oh. for sure.

537
00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.037
I get it. No dumb moves.

538
00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:45.127
I just need to learn what
you know. and I'll be just fine.

539
00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:46.927
- And that's the way it works around here.

540
00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:48.337
Keep your ears open.

541
00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:50.197
keep your hand on your gun.

542
00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.107
cause these crazy
motherfuckers will kill anybody.

543
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:54.153
cops included.

544
00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.647
- Wow.

545
00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:57.637
I didn't know it was that serious.

546
00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:00.187
but I'll stay focused and sharp.

547
00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:02.172
- Well. it is what it is.

548
00:27:02.255 --> 00:27:04.957
Let's go get some breakfast. You're buying.

549
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.607
I'll teach you some
more about these hustlers

550
00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:08.137
in these streets.

551
00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:09.967
- Cool. I'm all ears.

552
00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:12.457
And this food better be
on point cause I'm starving.

553
00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.017
- Yeah. it's the closest
thing to perfection

554
00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:15.600
you're gonna find around here.

555
00:27:25.927 --> 00:27:29.344
(Stringy R&amp;B beat plays)

556
00:27:38.228 --> 00:27:39.535
- What's up. man?

557
00:27:39.618 --> 00:27:41.487
- What's up with you?

558
00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:42.877
- How everything looking out here?

559
00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.037
- Shit pumping. What's good with you?

560
00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:47.347
- Nigga. I'm trying to get at these niggas

561
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:49.676
who snatched me up the other night.

562
00:27:49.759 --> 00:27:52.057
Motherfucker talking about
my brother got hit up and shit.

563
00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:53.107
You heard anything about that?

564
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:54.907
- Nah I ain't hear shit about that.

565
00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:56.707
Let's go handle this shit right now.

566
00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:58.947
- Nigga don't you know that
shit'll already be taken care of

567
00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:00.580
if I knew who these niggas was?

568
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:03.637
I don't know who these niggas is. man.

569
00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.227
But trust and believe I'm on that shit.

570
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:07.627
As soon as I find these
niggas. they dead nigga.

571
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:09.247
Man. lights out.

572
00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:12.465
- Okay. so did you find us a
new spot to branch out on?

573
00:28:12.548 --> 00:28:14.047
- No doubt. no doubt.

574
00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:17.257
I got motherfucking Al set
up on hoffa road and shit.

575
00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:18.847
Everything should be
jumping over there by now.

576
00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:20.977
I'm gonna go check on it later on and shit.

577
00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:23.710
- All right. well shit. I'm
ready whenever you ready.

578
00:28:24.595 --> 00:28:26.583
Keep me posted on them fools.

579
00:28:27.656 --> 00:28:29.227
I'm waiting to pop a nigga.

580
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:30.860
- Yeah. but let me get up with you. man.

581
00:28:30.943 --> 00:28:31.693
I got a couple more runs

582
00:28:31.776 --> 00:28:34.621
before I go check up
on Mr. Carter and shit.

583
00:28:34.704 --> 00:28:35.454
- Aight.

584
00:28:35.537 --> 00:28:36.727
- You be good out here. Be safe man.

585
00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:38.172

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.230
It's real out here. - Got you.

588
00:28:47.115 --> 00:28:51.532
(Old school hip hop jazz beat plays)

589
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:14.540
- West.

590
00:29:14.623 --> 00:29:16.647
Shit getting fucking crazy out here.

591
00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:18.813
We gotta get a handle on things.

592
00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:20.500
- Trust me.

593
00:29:20.583 --> 00:29:22.307
Just let the heat come my way

594
00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:24.459
and I take care of everything.

595
00:29:24.542 --> 00:29:26.737
- Perry been sniffing around

596
00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:28.867
trying to find out who put that hit on him.

597
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:31.807
And that shit's gonna fuck up business.

598
00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:33.722
- Man. fuck Perry!

599
00:29:33.805 --> 00:29:35.857
I'll tap his ass right now.

600
00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:37.090
Mr. Carter. just gimme
the motherfucking word.

601
00:29:37.173 --> 00:29:38.407
I'll take care of that shit.

602
00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:42.517
- Look. we don't need
need any more slip-ups.

603
00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:46.704
So you stay calm and
let me figure this shit out.

604
00:29:46.787 --> 00:29:47.620
Aight?

605
00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:50.523
No bodies.

606
00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.427
- Mr. Carter. that's what I do.

607
00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:55.927
I handle shit for you.

608
00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:58.057
So let me fucking handle it.

609
00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.873
- Listen something else I
need you to take care of.

610
00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:05.125
I need you to find out who
my daughter has been seeing.

611
00:30:05.208 --> 00:30:07.203
Keeping her out late at night.

612
00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.273
Not coming home.

613
00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:14.407
- She tell you who this nigga is?

614
00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:17.107
You know where I can
track him down or something?

615
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:21.577
- Nah. just that he's a good provider

616
00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.313
and she feels safe with him.

617
00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:28.354
Think my daughter's in love.

618
00:30:28.437 --> 00:30:30.020
This motherfucker.

619
00:30:32.043 --> 00:30:34.803
- I'll check it out. see

620
00:30:34.886 --> 00:30:36.875
And get it back at you.

621
00:30:36.958 --> 00:30:37.791
- Good.

622
00:30:38.976 --> 00:30:40.424
We meet up in a week.

623
00:30:40.507 --> 00:30:41.340

624
00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.541

625
00:30:59.624 --> 00:31:00.522
- What up. fam? - What's good. bro?

626
00:31:00.605 --> 00:31:01.687
That's the nigga I've

627
00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:03.120
Where the fuck you been at?

628
00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:05.827
- Yo. you know I had to hide out.

629
00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:08.827
Shit got way too hot after Leo disappeared.

630
00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:10.717
- Yeah. that shit was crazy though.

631
00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.613
But Swif. this my man lotto.

632
00:31:12.696 --> 00:31:13.747
He been holding shit down with me nigga

But hey look. crew's way

Did you holla at your uncle yet?

639
00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:27.277
- Hell no.

640
00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.347
But I know he been trying
to get in touch with me.

641
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:30.877
I ain't really had too much to say to him

642
00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:33.427

643

Yo. make sure you check in

I don't want that shit

647
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:42.397
You still scared of that nigga west?

- You not. nigga?

649
00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:47.167
- Fuck no! West works for my uncle.

650
00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:48.000
Not the other way around.

651
00:31:48.083 --> 00:31:49.117
And I already told you this.

652
00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.797

But yeah. good seeing you.

We gotta get up with you.

657
00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.317

Solid.

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:11.317
He the one who put me on.

661
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.650
- I just don't trust him.

662
00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:15.550
He on the same ground as us. bro.

663
00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:18.997
Look. he about to be back out.

664
00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.425
Keep eyes on him.

665
00:32:20.508 --> 00:32:23.086
Aight. - Aight. that's a bet.

666
00:32:23.169 --> 00:32:26.596
- Let's get outta here. - Word.

667
00:32:26.679 --> 00:32:30.679
(Old school hip hop beat plays)

668
00:32:34.176 --> 00:32:35.603
- Dark as hell.

669
00:32:35.686 --> 00:32:37.013
Damn.

670
00:32:37.096 --> 00:32:40.270
- This the spot when you

671
00:32:40.353 --> 00:32:42.857
leave a nigga right out this motherfucker.

672
00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:45.040
- Night night. Ain’t never find that nigga.

673
00:32:45.956 --> 00:32:47.257
Hit.

674
00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:51.087
- Then the whole thing about
motherfuckers ain't spooked.

675
00:32:52.087 --> 00:32:54.173
Niggas ain’t gonna chance
that shit coming back at 'em.

676
00:32:54.256 --> 00:32:57.362
You already know what
type of shit a nigga into.

677
00:32:57.445 --> 00:33:00.183
- Have a nigga saying.
ain't you papi? (Laughs)

678
00:33:00.266 --> 00:33:03.349
- Niggas think it's late. no joking.

679
00:33:05.736 --> 00:33:08.482
The store up here. in the creases.

680
00:33:08.565 --> 00:33:12.148
This little nigga here can go. right here.

681
00:33:15.468 --> 00:33:18.392
(Car beeps)

682
00:33:18.475 --> 00:33:21.861
- Is that because I
don't have a seatbelt on?

683
00:33:21.944 --> 00:33:23.777
- Safety first. right?

684
00:33:27.283 --> 00:33:30.410
- Oh. get this seatbelt around my fat ass.

685
00:33:33.824 --> 00:33:36.157

- You know. same ol'. same ol'.

688
00:33:51.614 --> 00:33:53.827
- Oh. I'm sure things are
gonna get a little different.

689
00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:57.123
This is. it's not the same
as doing street duty.

690
00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.523
- So how do you deal with it?

691
00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:06.127
- Well. let me tell you this much.

692
00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:08.793
Alcohol is gonna want
to be your best friend.

693
00:34:09.930 --> 00:34:11.373
Try not to let that happen.

694
00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:16.870
- There the police. too

695
00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.389

696
00:34:21.472 --> 00:34:22.305
- Damn!

697
00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:27.617
- Take it easy. Don't even worry about 'em.

698
00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:30.127
- Black nigga with a nice car.

699
00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:32.468

716
00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:13.927
They probably ain't supposed to be here.

717
00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:15.675
- Yeah. we definitely
need to pull them over.

718
00:35:15.758 --> 00:35:18.425
I know they got some damn drugs.

719
00:35:19.583 --> 00:35:21.877
- There's a little cross
over the yellow line.

720
00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:22.717
That's enough. don't you think?

721

00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:58.850
- I'm gonna need you

725
00:36:00.061 --> 00:36:01.684
(Car dings)

726
00:36:01.767 --> 00:36:04.053
Saw you guys weaving
quite a bit back there.

727
00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:07.220
Gimme your license and registration please.

728
00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:09.213

So watch yourself.

- What's wrong with your mans over there?

735
00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:24.367
Why is he all aggressive?

736
00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:26.797
We don't got no drugs
or nothing illegal on us.

737
00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:28.780
You do know black lives matter. right?

738
00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:31.987
- He's always like that.

739
00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:34.870
Especially when there's new people in town.

740
00:36:34.953 --> 00:36:37.267
And may I ask exactly what
you're doing here from DC

741
00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:38.870
in a high crime area?

742
00:36:38.953 --> 00:36:39.803
- Dude. fuck you.

743
00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:43.117
We ain't doing nothing illegal.

744
00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.767
so we can go when we wanna go.

745
00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:46.623
- You got a lot of mouth on you.

746
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:49.537
How about I shut it the fuck up.

747
00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:51.037
- Washington. just be cool.

748
00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:52.207
We're just a little unsure

749
00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:54.877
about how the rules work here in Baltimore.

750
00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:58.837
You check in before you
come into this town next time.

751
00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.177
- I got you. check in.

752
00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:03.693
It won't happen again. right freeze?

00:37:07.437 --> 00:37:08.883
- All right. Here's your ID.

755
00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:11.197
Need you guys to turn around.

756
00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.847
take your ass back to DC

757
00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:15.127

758
00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:16.237
You got me?

(Suspenseful music continues)

766
00:38:01.494 --> 00:38:03.142

767
00:38:03.225 --> 00:38:04.337

That's you. Do what you wanna do with it.

877
00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:12.983
You feel better?

878
00:43:14.294 --> 00:43:16.087
Smile girl. I'ma take care of this shit.

879
00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:17.420
Throw that fat ass on me.

880
00:43:25.102 --> 00:43:29.019
(Slow suspenseful music plays)

881
00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:45.363
- When I said show up alone.

882
00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:48.470
I didn't think you were gonna come.

883
00:43:49.592 --> 00:43:52.597
- We've known each
other a long time. Carter.

884
00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:55.443
I'm not worried one bit.
What's this all about anyway?

885
00:43:56.850 --> 00:43:57.693
- Look.

886
00:43:58.689 --> 00:43:59.703
I'm old.

887
00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:03.183
And I'm tired of looking over my shoulder.

888
00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:08.613
We need to have a discussion
about each other's lanes.

889
00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:11.914
- East side has always been sparks family.

890
00:44:11.997 --> 00:44:13.747
and we plan on keeping it that way.

891
00:44:14.999 --> 00:44:16.249
- I understand.

892
00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:20.917
And the West Side has
always been Carter's territory.

893
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.863
and we intend to keep it that way.

894
00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:28.807
But you and your sons
have been crossing the line.

895
00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:30.967
- West and his boys are setting things up

896
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:32.677
where they know it's the east side.

897
00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:37.627
Now Carter. I send
messages that are very clear

898
00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:39.277
and very loud.

899
00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.043
- Are you threatening me?

900
00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.507
I hope not.

901
00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:46.747
Cause I'd hate to show
you what I'm made of.

902
00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:49.053
And I mean that most sincerely.

903
00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:52.990
- I'm not hearing anything
that makes me want to stay.

904
00:44:53.073 --> 00:44:54.223
You're wasting my time.

905
00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:56.123
Good day.

906
00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:58.807
And I'll be ready when you are.

907
00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:17.003
- West.

908
00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.193
I need a message sent.

909
00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:24.233
Right.

910
00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:31.383
- Goose.

911
00:45:32.310 --> 00:45:33.727
How shit working for us out there. baby?

912
00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:36.303
- Man. I ain't come here
to talk about that shit. man.

913
00:45:36.386 --> 00:45:38.227
I'm hearing some personal shit.

914
00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:39.933
Some shit we need worked out.

915
00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:43.673
- Work that shit out. nigga. I'm listening.

916
00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:47.495
- Hey. look man.

917
00:45:47.578 --> 00:45:49.597
My motherfucking wife Regina.

918
00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.937
I had her helping me
motherfucking move some work.

919
00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:53.227
Some product.

920
00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:55.567
And some motherfucker
put a gun to her head.

921
00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:57.187
and took the fucking key from her.

922
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:58.720
You know anything about that?

923
00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:03.217
- Seem like me and
Mr. Carter problem is a little bit

924
00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:05.763

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:28.567

931
00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:30.037
- My nigga. look.

And I mean fucking hurt.

938
00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:48.580
- So this how Mr. Carter

939

- That wasn't me or my crew

I'm detective Washington.

00:50:24.094 --> 00:50:27.907
I told you we don't talk

- I read your files.

1010
00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:39.457
First case to come across my
desk is a must-know criminal.

1011
00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:42.997
- Look bro. Cut all that
psychological bullshit.

1012
00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:45.067
Y'all ain't nothing but

Outta here.

1016
00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:53.320
- Well that wasn't me. Brice.

1017
00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:56.170
See I'm cut from a different cloth.

I was you.

00:50:59.310 --> 00:51:00.963
Running. gunning in the street.

But then I manned up.

1021
00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:07.923
And became a cop so I could
take down dudes like you.

1022
00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:09.753

Can't fuck with me.

00:51:24.242 --> 00:51:26.200
Go back down 83. sit at your desk

1030
00:51:27.210 --> 00:51:29.437
and push that pencil or something.

1031

00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:17.317
- So what's the move?

1086
00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:19.717

00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:29.707

1092
00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:32.737
So ain't no goofy shit going on.

00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:33.727
- Look. check this out.

1094
00:54:33.810 --> 00:54:35.318
West fucks with me heavy.

1095
00:54:35.401 --> 00:54:36.270
So we ain't gonna have none of that.

1096
00:54:36.353 --> 00:54:38.737
- Cool. All right. well hit my phone.

1097
00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:39.877
Let me know when it's a go.

1098
00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:41.177
- Alrighty. - Aight.

1099
00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:45.127
- You sure this bitch solid?

1100
00:54:45.210 --> 00:54:46.677
Cause I hate to have to whack her.

1101
00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:48.410
it make me feel some type of way.

1102
00:54:49.411 --> 00:54:51.157
- You gotta do what you gotta do.

1103
00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:52.297
- You sure about that?

1104
00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:55.256
- Have I ever fucking second
guessed your judgment?

1105
00:54:55.339 --> 00:54:57.003
- Say less.

1106
00:54:57.086 --> 00:55:01.086
(Heavy suspenseful music plays)

1107
00:55:46.617 --> 00:55:47.664
- Motherfucker.

1108
00:55:47.747 --> 00:55:49.117
Who the fuck are you?

1109
00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:50.915
- Don't worry about all of that.

1110
00:55:50.998 --> 00:55:52.447
Just think of me as your
personal travel agent.

1111
00:55:52.530 --> 00:55:54.007
- Personal travel agent?

1112
00:55:54.090 --> 00:55:55.627
Okay bitch. how about this?

1113
00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:57.157
You cut me loose right here

1114
00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:59.617
and I give you a 24 hour fucking head start

1115
00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:02.253
before I hunt you down
and kill you my damn self.

1116
00:56:03.587 --> 00:56:05.664
- You know who I am motherfucker. huh?

1117
00:56:05.747 --> 00:56:07.486
You don't see the gun?

1118
00:56:07.569 --> 00:56:09.577
How about I pop yo
bitch ass right now. huh?

1119
00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:10.957
- Go ahead. motherfucker.

1120
00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:12.217
And watch as my whole family

1121
00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:14.523
tears your world to fucking pieces.

1122
00:56:15.427 --> 00:56:19.760
(Heavy suspenseful music continues)

1123
00:56:26.489 --> 00:56:27.753
- Lights out bitch.

1124
00:56:27.836 --> 00:56:30.484
- Hold! I told you to
move him. not kill him.

1125
00:56:30.567 --> 00:56:31.667
Use your fucking head.

1126
00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:35.213
You doing?

1127
00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:38.330
- Let me kill this bitch.

1128
00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:40.327
- Do you know the war that would start

1129
00:56:40.410 --> 00:56:43.177
if you killed this bitch. huh?

1130
00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:45.100
Need to let this bitch go.

1131
00:56:45.183 --> 00:56:46.297
Shit getting thick out here.

1132
00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:47.609
We got goose on our ass.

1133
00:56:47.692 --> 00:56:49.913
Now you want his family on our ass?

1134
00:56:49.996 --> 00:56:51.829
Use your fucking head.

1135
00:56:52.836 --> 00:56:54.490
- I thought they didn't see us.

1136
00:56:54.573 --> 00:56:56.043
- That shit don't matter.

1137
00:56:57.600 --> 00:56:58.510
I was with west the other day.

1138
00:56:58.593 --> 00:56:59.550
That nigga goose kept looking at me

1139
00:56:59.633 --> 00:57:02.017
like he fucking knew me or something.

1140
00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:02.866
- For real? - Yeah.

1141
00:57:02.949 --> 00:57:03.699
- Shit!

1142
00:57:03.782 --> 00:57:05.793
- Look. we gonna play
this shit smooth though.

1143
00:57:05.876 --> 00:57:10.746
We gonna drop this bitch off
somewhere he can be found.

1144
00:57:10.829 --> 00:57:12.735
So that shit off of us. You hear me?

1145
00:57:12.818 --> 00:57:14.215
- Aight. That's a bet.

1146
00:57:14.298 --> 00:57:15.906
Come. get your bitch ass up.

1147
00:57:15.989 --> 00:57:17.644
- Sit the fuck back down.

1148
00:57:17.727 --> 00:57:20.763
- You ain't finally sack up
enough and kill me yet boys?

1149
00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:24.743
- If I wanted to kill your
dumb ass. I woulda did it.

1150
00:57:25.834 --> 00:57:27.751
- Knock this bitch out.

1151
00:57:35.167 --> 00:57:36.876
- May I help you?

1152
00:57:36.959 --> 00:57:38.933
- I don't think you
wanna do that. detective.

1153
00:57:40.178 --> 00:57:41.587
I just came out here

1154
00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:43.820
to see why you been asking around about me.

1155
00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:46.150
- Well. that's easy.

1156
00:57:47.070 --> 00:57:48.093
You're a bad guy.

1157
00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:53.407
And my job is to take down bad
guys by any means necessary.

1158
00:57:53.490 --> 00:57:54.740
You do understand. right?

1159
00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:58.076
- Yeah. I understand that you don't-

1160
00:57:58.159 --> 00:58:00.127
I guess you don't care about living.

1161
00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:01.984
Cause I'm quite sure that
asking around about me.

1162
00:58:02.067 --> 00:58:04.087
you know what I'm capable of.

1163
00:58:04.170 --> 00:58:05.313
- Just a few things.

1164
00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:10.177
Like you being the shooter in
all of these unsolved murders

1165
00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:14.943
in Baltimore that I intend
on reopening and solving.

1166
00:58:15.810 --> 00:58:17.013
because I always win.

1167
00:58:19.950 --> 00:58:21.250
- That's funny. detective.

1168
00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:24.967
It's gonna be hard for you
to try to find all these people

1169
00:58:25.050 --> 00:58:28.833
that can say something that
ain't even talking anymore.

1170
00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:33.217
And the funny thing is
every time y'all get close.

1171
00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:35.617
it seems like they always disappear.

1172
00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:38.433
- You got a lot of balls
pressing up on me. west.

1173
00:58:39.690 --> 00:58:42.247
I guess you and your
brother share the same gene

1174
00:58:42.330 --> 00:58:43.117
from your pops.

1175
00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:45.363
- Look. I ain't got no father motherfucker.

1176
00:58:46.498 --> 00:58:49.927
Now my brother. that's a
different motherfucking situation.

1177
00:58:50.010 --> 00:58:51.787
We don't rock too tough.

1178
00:58:51.870 --> 00:58:55.533
But if you fuck with my brother.
I'ma lay you the fuck down.

1179
00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:57.993
And that's my word. detective.

1180
00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:10.983
- Your time is coming. on my word.

1181
00:59:19.837 --> 00:59:21.157
- Yeah buddy.

1182
00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:24.124
I used to knock 'em out the
park with this one right here.

1183
00:59:24.207 --> 00:59:25.040
Yeah.

1184
00:59:26.430 --> 00:59:29.323
Now I'm just cracking head. (Laughs)

1185
00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:37.417
Which one of you is goose?

1186
00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:38.333
- I'm goose.

1187
00:59:42.990 --> 00:59:45.015
So I'm guessing you Mr. Bentley.

1188
00:59:45.098 --> 00:59:47.304
Heard a lot about you.

1189
00:59:47.387 --> 00:59:48.697
- I hope whatever you heard

1190
00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:51.153
is a good representation of my character.

1191
00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:54.993
So. what can I do for you. goose?

1192
00:59:57.279 --> 00:59:58.029
- Aight. well check it out man.

1193
00:59:58.112 --> 01:00:00.727
I'm in need of some major weight right now.

1194
01:00:00.810 --> 01:00:04.713
Major weight. And I need it
fast while the market's booming.

1195
01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:08.410
I need to cash in my profits

1196
01:00:08.493 --> 01:00:10.593
or my buyer start looking elsewhere.

1197
01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:16.233
- All right. Check this out. goose.

1198
01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:19.628
The risk is very high on my end

1199
01:00:19.711 --> 01:00:22.948
so I'm going need a bigger cut.

1200
01:00:23.031 --> 01:00:23.864
So

1201
01:00:25.233 --> 01:00:28.383
It's very dangerous fishing
in somebody else's lake.

1202
01:00:29.310 --> 01:00:32.013
Specifically Mr. Carter and Mr. Sparks.

1203
01:00:35.130 --> 01:00:36.063
- I understand.

1204
01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:38.677
We can work those numbers out. don't worry.

1205
01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:39.933
won't be no problem.

1206
01:00:40.811 --> 01:00:43.027
Me and Van. we'll make
sure the product be safe.

1207
01:00:43.110 --> 01:00:44.437
It'll stay safe.

1208
01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.147
- That's our word.

1209
01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:47.823
- Product safety is key.

1210
01:00:48.747 --> 01:00:51.457
But we don't need an all
out war if we don't need one.

1211
01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:55.053
So. I'm going to need a
guaranteed quarter mill.

1212
01:00:55.889 --> 01:00:57.997
If you need me to ship that shit to you.

1213
01:00:59.409 --> 01:01:01.076
Can you handle that?

1214
01:01:04.679 --> 01:01:08.179
- Say less. Van give the man the bag. man.

1215
01:01:19.799 --> 01:01:22.507
- All right. well I'll make
sure my man get that package

1216
01:01:22.590 --> 01:01:23.716
out to you in a couple of days

1217
01:01:23.799 --> 01:01:26.284
and we can get this
party started right away.

1218
01:01:26.367 --> 01:01:27.267
And I look forward

1219
01:01:29.871 --> 01:01:34.871
to a lifelong life of business.

1220
01:01:36.139 --> 01:01:37.306
- Sounds good.

1221
01:01:38.551 --> 01:01:39.384
We ready.

1222
01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:41.610
- Thanks.

01:10:55.999 --> 01:10:58.057
cause you know we worry
about you being out late.

1397
01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:00.446
- Now be careful how
you use that word friend.

1398
01:11:00.529 --> 01:11:02.501
Shit is almost non-existent out here. man.

1399
01:11:02.584 --> 01:11:03.863
Be careful.

1400
01:11:03.946 --> 01:11:05.587
- I'll keep that in mind. pops. You right.

1401
01:11:05.670 --> 01:11:09.103
And mama. I'll make sure
I'm here on time tonight. okay?

1402
01:11:09.186 --> 01:11:10.207
Aight.

01:11:10.290 --> 01:11:12.160
- See you. baby. - Later.

1404
01:11:14.336 --> 01:11:16.813
- I don't know where he get
that smart ass mouth from.

1405
01:11:16.896 --> 01:11:18.367
- Are you serious. goose?

1406
01:11:18.450 --> 01:11:20.403
Attitude in you is all day.

1407
01:11:23.370 --> 01:11:24.520
- That's my boy. right?

1408
01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:27.813
Like his daddy.

1409
01:11:29.190 --> 01:11:30.240
- You something else.

1410
01:11:34.872 --> 01:11:39.039
(Slow heavy suspense music plays)

1411
01:11:45.093 --> 01:11:45.843
- What's up captain.

1412
01:11:45.926 --> 01:11:47.193
- Ain't shit. ain’t shit.

1413
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.117
- What's up west?

1414
01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:53.433
- What's the move. sway?

1415
01:11:54.450 --> 01:11:56.767
- Just standing 10 toes

1416
01:11:56.850 --> 01:12:00.037
- I heard you be making
moves outside the fucking family.

1417
01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:01.087
- Hell nah.

1418
01:12:01.170 --> 01:12:03.279
Man. I'm down with this crew all day.

1419
01:12:03.362 --> 01:12:05.926
- That ain't what I been hearing. sway.

1420
01:12:06.009 --> 01:12:08.017
And the streets be talking.

1421
01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:08.977
What's up?

1422
01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:12.817
- Look man. I swear I'm

1423
01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:15.003
I'm not doing no side business.

1424
01:12:16.199 --> 01:12:17.032
- Okay.

1425
01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:20.073
- And she's fucking cee cee. too.

1426
01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:23.947
- Oh so you fucking cee cee now?

1427
01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:24.937
I thought I told y'all niggas

1428
01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:27.637

1429
01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:29.557
Who the fuck you been talking to. sway?

1430
01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:31.320
Cause the streets don't motherfucking lie.

1431
01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:34.597
- Yo. west. I'm telling
you. it's Brice aight?

1432
01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:36.577
It's Brice. He been
trying to get me to snitch

1433
01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:37.897
but I ain't told him shit.

1434
01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:38.878
- So this motherfucker Brice

1435
01:12:38.961 --> 01:12:39.711
fucking with my motherfucking business?

1436
01:12:39.794 --> 01:12:41.737
- Yes.

1437
01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:43.663
- Okay. Let that bitch breathe.

1438
01:12:43.746 --> 01:12:45.222
Bounce.

1439
01:12:45.305 --> 01:12:46.138
- Fuck!

1440
01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:49.267
- West. you should let
me ice that nigga Brice

1441
01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:51.457

- Nah. no. no. no.

1442
01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:53.178
Just chill. aight?

1443
01:12:53.261 --> 01:12:54.011
I'm gonna take care of this shit.

1444
01:12:54.094 --> 01:12:55.507
I'm gonna go holla at him.

1445
01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:58.268
Dre. don't fuck with him. promise me.

1446
01:12:58.351 --> 01:12:59.228
- All right. got you boss.

1447
01:12:59.311 --> 01:13:01.144
- Aight. let's get it.

1448
01:13:06.633 --> 01:13:10.300
(Grungy hip hop beat plays)

1449
01:13:43.647 --> 01:13:46.497
- You guys need to be more
careful coming into Baltimore.

1450
01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:49.507
- Is that right?

1451
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:50.857
- Yeah. that's right.

1452
01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:52.297
- Check this shit out.

1453
01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:54.127
We pay you to hook up with us

1454
01:13:54.210 --> 01:13:56.407
to move shit around here easy. ya dig?

1455
01:13:56.490 --> 01:13:57.577
- Yeah. you do.

1456
01:13:57.660 --> 01:13:59.317
And it was really close the other night

1457
01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:01.597
when I had my rookie with me.

1458
01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:03.997
Look. I can't just cut you guys breaks.

1459
01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:06.459
He's gonna know something's going on.

1460
01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:10.080
- Look. Next time. make sure we good.

1461
01:14:10.163 --> 01:14:12.397
Cause I ain't got no
problem with busting a hole

1462
01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:13.747
in one of these motherfuckers.

1463
01:14:13.830 --> 01:14:17.227
- You need to be chill. You
do that and nobody moves.

1464
01:14:17.310 --> 01:14:18.060
All right?

1465
01:14:18.143 --> 01:14:20.077
Cops are gonna be all over this city

1466
01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:22.177
fucking with every black man walking

1467
01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:24.067
and then nobody makes money.

1468
01:14:24.150 --> 01:14:26.107
- Freeze. Chill the fuck out. man.

1469
01:14:26.190 --> 01:14:27.123
Stand down.

1470
01:14:28.253 --> 01:14:29.917
We're about making bread.

1471
01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.287
So let's stay on the task at hand.

1472
01:14:32.370 --> 01:14:34.370
And cut all that chit-chatting shit out.

1473
01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:36.847
- You got my donation?

1474
01:14:36.930 --> 01:14:37.893
- Yep. Right here.

1475
01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:44.077
- You like what you see?

1476
01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.187
- Mm hmm.

1477
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:47.757
- So look. we already met up with west.

1478
01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:49.277
We got some product

1479
01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:53.227
and it's just enough to start
taking over these blocks now.

1480
01:14:53.310 --> 01:14:55.477
- That is not the plan.

1481
01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:59.557
It was just to get you guys
in and out for the drug runs.

1482
01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:00.390
That's it.

1483
01:15:00.473 --> 01:15:03.173
- Look. chill out detective. We got you.

1484
01:15:10.543 --> 01:15:12.037
- I still don't think it's a smart move

1485
01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:13.507
double crossing west.

1486
01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:15.637
- Man. fuck west.

1487
01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:19.808
We need him now and after
that he's no longer needed.

1488
01:15:19.891 --> 01:15:20.724
- Boom.

1489
01:15:22.109 --> 01:15:23.617
- All right. Just leave my name out of it.

1490
01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:24.577
All right?

1491
01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:26.660
- Don't worry. Nobody will say anything.

1492
01:15:28.350 --> 01:15:29.287
Bitch.

1493
01:15:29.370 --> 01:15:32.643
- You do know we going have
to get rid of his ass too right?

1494
01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:34.603
- I know.

1495
01:15:43.261 --> 01:15:46.428
(Rain pitter patters)

1496
01:15:52.258 --> 01:15:55.841
(Soft melodic music plays)

1497
01:16:19.977 --> 01:16:22.117
- You always been in my business

1498
01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:24.050
even when we was fucking kids. nigga.

1499
01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:32.527
- West. why the fuck you
keep popping up on me

1500
01:16:32.610 --> 01:16:33.603
like we friends?

1501
01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:37.297
- We ain't friends
motherfucker. we brothers.

1502
01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:39.730
Because we come from
the same fucked up father.

1503
01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:43.233
So that make us somewhat family.

1504
01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:46.023
- We not your family. bro.

1505
01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:50.524
Our fucking father in
there dying right now.

1506
01:16:50.607 --> 01:16:51.824
You ain't call.

1507
01:16:51.907 --> 01:16:53.403
You ain't come to visit.

1508
01:16:54.867 --> 01:16:56.973
You ain't even sent him a letter. west.

1509
01:16:58.236 --> 01:17:00.487
You know what? You a piece of shit.

1510
01:17:00.570 --> 01:17:03.183
Fuck you and everything you stand for.

1511
01:17:04.590 --> 01:17:05.647
- Okay.

1512
01:17:05.730 --> 01:17:06.577
So I'm supposed to give a fuck

1513
01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:08.317
about a motherfucker who
wasn't even there for me?

1514
01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:10.387
- Come on with that crying shit. west.

1515
01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:12.594
Come on. - He left me and my mother

1516
01:17:12.677 --> 01:17:15.187
in the fucking cold. my nigga.

1517
01:17:15.270 --> 01:17:17.553
What you know about that Brice? Huh?

1518
01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:21.127
We ain't had no running water. my nigga.

1519
01:17:21.210 --> 01:17:23.073
I remember many nights that we had-

1520
01:17:24.330 --> 01:17:25.657
we had to go to the gas station. man

1521
01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:27.577
where I had to steal fucking water.

1522
01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:31.597
We used to wash our fucking
ass in the dark. my nigga.

1523
01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:34.923
So fuck him. cause he never
gave a damn about me anyway.

1524
01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:39.697
- Look. west. He been
trying to reach out to you.

1525
01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:42.007
He been calling your fucking phone.

1526
01:17:42.090 --> 01:17:43.987
You been sending him to voicemail.

1527
01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:45.003
Hanging up on him.

1528
01:17:46.015 --> 01:17:47.865
You acting like a little bitch. west.

1529
01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:50.494
Now he in there about to die.

1530
01:17:50.577 --> 01:17:52.113
And you pull this shit.

1531
01:17:55.590 --> 01:17:58.833
- So you want me to give a fuck about him?

1532
01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:03.427
Where was he at when I needed him. Brice?

1533
01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:04.600
Where was he. bro?

1534
01:18:05.553 --> 01:18:08.303
Oh. I remember. You had him. man.

1535
01:18:09.623 --> 01:18:11.290
You had him. Not me.

1536
01:18:12.540 --> 01:18:15.400
So fuck you. Fuck him.

1537
01:18:15.483 --> 01:18:17.137
Stay the fuck outta my life

1538
01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:19.383
and not in my fucking business. bro.

1539
01:18:21.673 --> 01:18:23.523
- You need to let that shit go. west.

1540
01:18:24.535 --> 01:18:25.368
West!

1541
01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:41.197
- Mr. Bentley. what
brings you to Baltimore?

1542
01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:44.167
- My apologies for any
intrusion. Mr. Carter.

1543
01:18:44.250 --> 01:18:46.027
but I just wanted to come down

1544
01:18:46.110 --> 01:18:49.057
and have a man to man talk
with you on some business.

1545
01:18:49.140 --> 01:18:50.227
- And what business is it

1546
01:18:50.310 --> 01:18:52.037
you think I might be interested in?

1547
01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:55.987
I'm a very busy man
and my time is precious.

1548
01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:57.847
- Well I don't wanna waste any time.

1549
01:18:57.930 --> 01:19:00.453
Time is money and money
is what I'm all about so.

1550
01:19:01.770 --> 01:19:05.077
Let's have a taste test of
my product with your runners.

1551
01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:08.373
And watch your sales soar in a week.

1552
01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:13.447
- You seem very confident in your work.

1553
01:19:13.530 --> 01:19:17.820
But I'm afraid it's I who will be taking on

1554
01:19:17.903 --> 01:19:21.974
most of the risk and problems
with my recent supplier.

1555
01:19:22.057 --> 01:19:24.007
- Who? Perry?

1556
01:19:24.090 --> 01:19:26.377
Ah. he's harmless.

1557
01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:29.360
And if he interferes (laughs)

1558
01:19:30.990 --> 01:19:32.613
He won't be a problem. trust me.

1559
01:19:34.267 --> 01:19:37.477
- I like your positive outlook on things.

1560
01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:39.937
We will set up a taste test

1561
01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:42.277
and see how we move forward from there

1562
01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:44.583
before making any big orders.

1563
01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:46.563
- Sounds like a deal.

1564
01:19:47.730 --> 01:19:49.357
Let's shake on it.

1565
01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:50.273
- My pleasure.

1566
01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:56.703
- And please. and I say
this with a kind heart.

1567
01:19:57.690 --> 01:19:59.373
be a man of your word.

1568
01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:02.410
And we shouldn't have any problems.

1569
01:20:03.810 --> 01:20:05.283
- I stand on it.

1570
01:20:19.279 --> 01:20:22.779
(Suspenseful music plays)

1571
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:31.837
- Son. where have you been?

1572
01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:32.797
- Oh I'm cool pops.

1573
01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:34.507
but these two motherfuckers had me tied up

1574
01:20:34.590 --> 01:20:37.177
in the back of some big
rig all the way across town.

1575
01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:39.097
I had to walk my ass all the way back.

1576
01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:40.387
- Did you get to see how they look?

1577
01:20:40.470 --> 01:20:42.547
- Nah. I ain't see nothing on 'em.

1578
01:20:42.630 --> 01:20:43.837
- What about they voices?

1579
01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:44.797
- Nah. I ain't recognize.

1580
01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:47.707
Only thing I tell you about
'em is they was tall as a bitch.

1581
01:20:47.790 --> 01:20:50.017
- That's what goose was
saying about who had him.

1582
01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:52.207
He'd never seen him before either.

1583
01:20:52.290 --> 01:20:53.040
- I don't know. pops.

1584
01:20:53.123 --> 01:20:55.147
We need to hunt these
motherfuckers down right now

1585
01:20:55.230 --> 01:20:56.137
and deal with 'em.

1586
01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:57.277
- Yeah pop.

1587
01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:59.647
We need to make fucking
examples out of these guys

1588
01:20:59.730 --> 01:21:02.227
before they start thinking we fucking soft.

1589
01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:04.874
- Look. I am so glad you say this son.

1590
01:21:04.957 --> 01:21:08.167
but I don't want you or you to get hurt

1591
01:21:08.250 --> 01:21:11.767
because we're reacting with emotions. okay?

1592
01:21:11.850 --> 01:21:15.037
Pull back and let me work
on the next phase of the plan.

1593
01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:16.747
- Pops. these motherfuckers
almost killed me.

1594
01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:17.887
Now you want me to take it easy?

1595
01:21:17.970 --> 01:21:18.803
- Just for now.

1596
01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:22.507
No. first we need to know who exactly it is

1597
01:21:22.590 --> 01:21:24.630
we're dealing with. okay?

1598
01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:26.546
- Man. fuck this. man!

1599
01:21:29.790 --> 01:21:32.140
- Come on. pops. I ain’t
dealing with this shit.

- Shit. I don't know. Why you asking me?

1608
01:22:07.875 --> 01:22:09.427
The fuck. Where it come from?

1609
01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:11.287
- It came outta your son's room.

1610
01:22:11.370 --> 01:22:12.704
I found it in his closet
when I was cleaning it out.

1611
01:22:12.787 --> 01:22:14.403
It was in a shoebox.

1612
01:22:15.824 --> 01:22:16.810
- Well shit. I ain't give it to him.

1613
01:22:16.893 --> 01:22:19.760
What you screaming on me for?

1614
01:22:21.333 --> 01:22:23.677
- This all starts with you. goose.

1615
01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:24.510
He's turning in to be you

1616
01:22:24.593 --> 01:22:27.337
and I'm scared of what
could happen to him out there.

1617
01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:29.387
- Look. I'll talk to him. aight?

1618
01:22:29.470 --> 01:22:31.113
Shit. don't worry so much. man.

1619
01:22:32.401 --> 01:22:34.177
He just a kid. He probably
just holding it for a friend.

1620
01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:35.163
Shit. I used to.

1621
01:22:36.275 --> 01:22:38.701
You know what I'm saying?

1622
01:22:38.784 --> 01:22:40.610
I'm sure he ain't selling
nothing or nothing like that.

1623
01:22:40.693 --> 01:22:42.040
- He better not be.

1624
01:22:42.123 --> 01:22:45.127
Shit. this is getting
way outta hand and I'm-

1625
01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:48.060
I just can't think about my
baby being involved in drugs.

1626
01:22:49.110 --> 01:22:50.797
- Babe. I got it. aight?

1627
01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:52.717
What's up with all this scary shit?

1628
01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:54.877
He in good hands.

1629
01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:56.477
Shit. I'll handle it. aight?

1630
01:22:57.750 --> 01:23:00.667
- What if what happened to
your brother happens to him. huh?

1631
01:23:00.750 --> 01:23:01.583
Then what?

1632
01:23:02.432 --> 01:23:04.117
- Hey. didn't I say I got it?

1633
01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:06.700
The fuck you gotta bring
that shit up for. Regina?

1634
01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:10.300
God damn. you don't know when to quit.

1635
01:23:20.541 --> 01:23:23.208
I know that nigga ain’t hustling.

1636
01:23:24.101 --> 01:23:27.434
(Heavy bass beat plays)

1637
01:23:34.873 --> 01:23:37.173
- I need you to look
into this person for me.

1638
01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:39.907
- What's this all about?

1639
01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:42.307
My office is up my ass

1640
01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:45.093
about all this outside work I'm doing.

1641
01:23:46.140 --> 01:23:48.937
- Listen. your office will understand

1642
01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:52.923
when they realize it's
a matter of life or death.

1643
01:23:53.910 --> 01:23:55.627
- I don't mean to be difficult.

1644
01:23:55.710 --> 01:23:59.947
but if I get barred that
means I don't have access

1645
01:24:00.030 --> 01:24:03.727
to be able to help you with your business.

1646
01:24:03.810 --> 01:24:07.777
- This is a new supplier
and he's got a good product.

1647
01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:10.966
I just don't trust him just yet.

1648
01:24:11.049 --> 01:24:13.367
It's very imperative.

1649
01:24:13.450 --> 01:24:15.097
- Oh. alright.

1650
01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:18.487
I'll look into it. see what I can find out.

1651
01:24:18.570 --> 01:24:21.560
But I'm going to need a little time.

1652
01:24:21.643 --> 01:24:26.643
- Mm hmm. Yeah well I'm not
jumping until I hear from you.

1653
01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:29.373
- And what if I'm not
able to find anything?

1654
01:24:30.810 --> 01:24:32.613
What's going to be your next move?

1655
01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:37.833
- I'll let you know when
you find out about it.

1656
01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:42.397
- All right. I'll look
into it right away. sir.

1657
01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:43.920
Yes sir. Yes I will.

1658
01:24:51.639 --> 01:24:53.697
(Door slams)

1659
01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:55.363
Old son of a bitch.

1660
01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:00.213
Have a good day. Good evening.

1661
01:25:14.491 --> 01:25:17.677
- Mr. Bentley. what's the word?

1662
01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:19.413
You got that? - Slow down.

1663
01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:21.847
Before I hand you this bag.

1664
01:25:21.930 --> 01:25:25.176
we need to discuss a few minor details.

1665
01:25:25.259 --> 01:25:27.933
- What minor details?
This fool tripping. man.

1666
01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:32.947
- I can always find some
young dumb ass niggas

1667
01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:34.413
to run some work for me.

1668
01:25:35.730 --> 01:25:37.297
But I'm trying to give you guys a chance

1669
01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:39.333
to get rich with me.

1670
01:25:41.149 --> 01:25:42.847
Or get killed by me.

1671
01:25:42.930 --> 01:25:43.763
You decide.

1672
01:25:47.250 --> 01:25:48.850
- Why all the noise Mr. Bentley?

1673
01:25:49.701 --> 01:25:51.907
We just hungry for
our own Lane. that's all.

1674
01:25:51.990 --> 01:25:53.827
We not playing no games.

1675
01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:54.660
- Yeah. man.

1676
01:25:54.743 --> 01:25:56.167
We about this hustle game.

1677
01:25:56.250 --> 01:25:59.947
- Now the next time you two
motherfuckers get outta line.

1678
01:26:00.030 --> 01:26:02.767
I'm going to put some bullets in your ass.

1679
01:26:02.850 --> 01:26:04.023
Do you understand me?

1680
01:26:05.451 --> 01:26:07.957
Do you understand me?

1681
01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:09.333
- Yeah man. I understand.

1682
01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:12.580
- Hand them the bag.

1683
01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:19.413
This is how I want things.

1684
01:26:20.490 --> 01:26:22.590
Every month I'm gonna give you two bricks.

1685
01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:26.883
In 30 days. I'ma want
all my cut. no shorts.

1686
01:26:27.847 --> 01:26:29.248
I make myself clear?

1687
01:26:29.331 --> 01:26:30.164
- Crystal.

1688
01:26:34.221 --> 01:26:35.471
- Run along now

1689
01:26:37.527 --> 01:26:38.883
and go make me my money.

1690
01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:43.980
Don't come in here late again.

1691
01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:51.040
Turn them frowns upside down. (Laughs)

1692
01:26:52.872 --> 01:26:54.539
The fuck outta here!

1693
01:27:05.712 --> 01:27:08.097
(Car engine revs)

1694
01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:13.180
- Got your ass now.
fucker! (Gun shots popping)

1695
01:27:23.691 --> 01:27:26.774
(Heartbeat pounding)

1696
01:27:38.893 --> 01:27:42.643
