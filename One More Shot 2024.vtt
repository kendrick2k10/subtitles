to say to him?

177
00:09:13.138 --> 00:09:14.795
Well.

Make him feel like
you two could reconnect again.

180
00:09:21.699 --> 00:09:23.977
I... No. we have
to make him feel

181
00:09:24.115 --> 00:09:27.359
like there's something
he could really lose.

182

I should be asking you
the same question.

We had no intel. no air support.
completely on our own.

219
00:12:18.668 --> 00:12:21.775
I lost my whole team. keeping
that piece of shit alive.

220
00:12:23.121 --> 00:12:24.882
And I lost one of mine.

221

she was a dear. dear friend.

And you...

226
00:12:39.931 --> 00:12:41.657
You should've protected her.

to deliver Mansur.

00:12:59.192 --> 00:13:01.021
You think it was
some random attack?

Bunch of insurgents turned up
out of the fucking blue?

235
00:13:03.437 --> 00:13:05.646
