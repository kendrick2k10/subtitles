00:00:49.675 --> 00:00:51.176
<i>How did it all start?</i>

4
00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:55.722
<i>I mean.
my girls inspired the first Beanies.</i>

5
00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:08.652
<i>I was employee number 12.</i>

6
00:01:09.987 --> 00:01:14.449
<i>Three years later. we were the most
profitable toy company in the world.</i>

7
00:01:24.668 --> 00:01:28.505
<i>Ty would tell you
he did it all. but that's bullshit.</i>

8
00:01:29.882 --> 00:01:32.009
<i>We built that company together.</i>

9
00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:34.178
<i>From nothing.</i>

10
00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:42.352
<i>I mean. that's the whole point of America.
right?</i>

11
00:01:44.396 --> 00:01:48.066
<i>Work hard. Build something good.</i>

12
00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:53.947
<i>Get yourself in the right place
at the right time. and boom.</i>

13
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.145
{\an8}<i>We didn't set out
to make America lose its mind.</i>

14
00:03:49.897 --> 00:03:51.190
<i>but that's what happened.</i>

15
00:03:55.903 --> 00:03:58.780
<i>Was it crazy
to turn stuffed animals into investments?</i>

16
00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:09.291
<i>It was a crazy time.</i>

17
00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:15.506
<i>The Internet was new.
The Boomers were taking over.</i>

18
00:04:15.506 --> 00:04:20.344
<i>But we turned Beanie Babies
into little plush lotto tickets.</i>

19
00:04:21.845 --> 00:04:25.098
<i>At the peak of the bubble.
more than half the country owned one.</i>

20
00:04:25.933 --> 00:04:30.562
<i>Ty was the one with his name on the tag.
The one who made billions.</i>

21
00:04:31.355 --> 00:04:33.649
<i>But he couldn't have done it
without the three of us.</i>

22
00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:37.778
-<i>He didn't do it without the three of us.</i>
- Ty!

23
00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:39.696
<i>So this story's not about him.</i>

24
00:04:40.197 --> 00:04:41.823
<i>It's about us.</i>

25
00:04:57.464 --> 00:04:58.799
<i>I met Ty back in the '80s</i>

26
00:04:58.799 --> 00:05:01.093
<i>when we were living
in the same apartment building.</i>

27
00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:07.140
Oh. God. not my husband!

28
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.060
- Ma'am. I need you to just back up. okay?
- Oh. my God. Is this Billy?

29
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.813
<i>When his dad died.</i>

30
00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:18.318
Oh. shit.

31
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.451
Billy.

32
00:05:28.287 --> 00:05:29.663
did you take your meds?

33
00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:33.458
Did you take your meds today?

34
00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:34.960
Yeah.

35
00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:37.629
Did you pick up more Tab?

36
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:40.841
Yeah.

37
00:06:06.617 --> 00:06:09.453
- Hi.
- I'm so sorry for your loss.

38
00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:13.749
I baked this.

39
00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:15.918
- Here. I'll just put it down for you.
- Yeah. Okay.

40
00:06:15.918 --> 00:06:18.295
Yeah. it's a lasagna. Maybe just here?

41
00:06:22.424 --> 00:06:23.425
I'm not psycho.

42
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:28.555
I dissect them
to see how they're made for work.

43
00:06:29.515 --> 00:06:32.476
Not for fun.
But to be honest. it is pretty fun.

44
00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:34.102
Right.

45
00:06:35.687 --> 00:06:37.773
My dad would say.
"You gotta make your own luck.

46
00:06:38.941 --> 00:06:42.528
You can't wait for your ship to come in.
Son. You gotta build your own ship."

47
00:06:42.528 --> 00:06:44.154
That's what he would say.

48
00:06:45.906 --> 00:06:48.867
- Have you told your mom yet?
- Oh. God. no.

49
00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:53.205
She is a violent paranoid schizophrenic
who abandoned us years ago.

50
00:06:54.915 --> 00:06:56.667
Where was your dad for all this?

51
00:06:57.292 --> 00:06:58.669
On the road. selling toys.

52
00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:00.796
Oh. man.

53
00:07:01.296 --> 00:07:03.257
It's okay. Was better that way.

54
00:07:03.799 --> 00:07:06.635
Otherwise he would be at home.
beating the crap out of me.

55
00:07:07.344 --> 00:07:09.137
Wait. I--

56
00:07:11.056 --> 00:07:13.308
- I thought you two were so close.
- No.

57
00:07:15.102 --> 00:07:17.813
The only time my dad was proud of me

58
00:07:18.647 --> 00:07:22.860
is when our girlfriend told him
how good I was in bed.

59
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.615
-"Our girlfriend."
- Yeah. the same woman.

60
00:07:29.283 --> 00:07:30.617
- You dated the same woman?
- No.

61
00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:31.952
- At the same time?
- No. not--

62
00:07:31.952 --> 00:07:35.998
- No. not always at the same time. no.
- Okay.

63
00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:38.333
We're gonna need another.

64
00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:43.255
I do and do not want to know
much. much more.

65
00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:52.931
<i>My story started ten years later.</i>

66
00:07:53.432 --> 00:07:56.185
<i>when I first
walked into the offices of Ty Inc.</i>

67
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:04.151
<i>I was a 17-year-old college
freshman just trying to land a temp job.</i>

68
00:08:05.027 --> 00:08:07.571
<i>Not usher in a new era of capitalism.</i>

69
00:08:09.323 --> 00:08:12.284
You'd be expected to brush
and tweeze the display cats.

70
00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:18.123
- Oh. wow. You're serious.
- Yeah.

71
00:08:18.123 --> 00:08:22.377
But the job's mainly the phones.
Four hours a day. plus some Saturdays.

72
00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:24.129
You said you're in school?

73
00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:26.924
- Yeah. I'm in school--
-<i>Roberta. sweetie.</i>

74
00:08:26.924 --> 00:08:29.760
<i>you need to come tell me
which one of these looks like marigold.</i>

75
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.347
You pressed "Intercom All" again. And no.

76
00:08:35.974 --> 00:08:36.975
Bye.

77
00:08:39.937 --> 00:08:42.898
Yeah. I'm in school.
but the schedule's not a problem.

78
00:08:43.649 --> 00:08:44.650
I just need money.

79
00:08:45.609 --> 00:08:47.736
Tuition's tough these days. huh?

80
00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:50.239
I've got a scholarship. It's for rent.

81
00:08:50.239 --> 00:08:53.825
If I keep living at home.
my soul will soon be fully crushed.

82
00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:57.746
We pay minimum wage.
Not sure that's a salvation salary.

83
00:08:57.746 --> 00:08:59.414
You don't know how cheap my soul is.

84
00:09:01.959 --> 00:09:03.627
We do what we gotta do. right?

85
00:09:04.545 --> 00:09:06.129
This just pays my bungee bills.

86
00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:10.133
Oh. Robbie. I need you. Robbie?

87
00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:12.427
Rose. which color is better?

88
00:09:12.427 --> 00:09:14.680
- Don't know. don't care.
- What about you? What do you think?

89
00:09:15.264 --> 00:09:16.974
I'm not really a cat person.

90
00:09:16.974 --> 00:09:19.142
Are you an amazing things person?

91
00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.773
Yeah. I wouldn't go yellow at all.
Too mild.

92
00:09:25.566 --> 00:09:27.442
These little punks wanna be tiger-striped.

93
00:09:28.777 --> 00:09:30.946
But wouldn't stripes make them
too convict-y?

94
00:09:30.946 --> 00:09:34.408
Well. cats are outlaws.
Convict-y is kinda their appeal.

95
00:09:34.408 --> 00:09:35.492
Yes.

96
00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:39.538
Rose. she has a good point. What--

97
00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:42.416
Rose. what are you looking at?

98
00:09:44.543 --> 00:09:46.128
<i>We'll get to that later.</i>

99
00:09:46.128 --> 00:09:47.880
Don't go anywhere.

100
00:09:51.216 --> 00:09:52.718
Does that mean I'm hired?

101
00:09:52.718 --> 00:09:53.886
<i>It did.</i>

102
00:09:53.886 --> 00:09:57.097
<i>But obviously none of this
would have happened without Sheila.</i>

103
00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:05.189
<i>Mr. President and Mrs. Clinton.</i>

104
00:10:05.189 --> 00:10:07.983
<i>and Americans everywhere.</i>

105
00:10:08.609 --> 00:10:13.530
<i>A Rock. A River. A Tree Hosts...</i>

106
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.867
<i>It certainly wasn't my dream
designing lights for people like Ty.</i>

107
00:10:17.534 --> 00:10:20.829
<i>I did it to pay the bills.
to support my girls.</i>

108
00:10:23.457 --> 00:10:26.502
Well. I've been waiting since 9:00.
Does he need to reschedule?

109
00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:29.963
Honestly. if I were you. I'd just bail.

110
00:10:32.257 --> 00:10:34.510
<i>I wanted the world to be better for them.</i>

111
00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:39.556
<i>I wanted it to get kinder and happier
and more human.</i>

112
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:42.726
<i>I wanted it to hurry up.</i>

113
00:10:52.486 --> 00:10:54.821
Lights. right? I'll be right with ya.

114
00:10:56.865 --> 00:10:58.825
<i>The UK is a mess. and it's not my fault.</i>

115
00:10:58.825 --> 00:11:01.620
And the last thing I would do
is to hire incompetent partners--

116
00:11:03.789 --> 00:11:05.207
Excuse me. what are you doing?

117
00:11:05.207 --> 00:11:07.125
Do you often keep people waiting
three hours?

118
00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:08.585
It has been a hectic--

119
00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:11.129
'Cause I told my sick daughters
I'd be back as quick as I could.

120
00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:12.214
and then I waited here

121
00:11:12.214 --> 00:11:14.091
- for longer than a human should--
- I run a company

122
00:11:14.091 --> 00:11:16.635
- that's highly unpredictable--
- Okay. I know you're busy.

123
00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:18.136
And I know you're rich.

124
00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:21.014
But I also know that life is too short
to waste on assholes.

125
00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:24.017
so please move your car.
or I'll move it for you less gently.

126
00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:25.435
I got better places to be.

127
00:11:27.688 --> 00:11:28.689
Wow.

128
00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:31.400
May I come?

129
00:11:32.484 --> 00:11:33.902
I am not joking.

130
00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:38.115
I am so sorry. Let me make it up to you.
Let me take you to dinner.

131
00:11:38.115 --> 00:11:40.284
No. I only eat dinner with my daughters.

132
00:11:40.993 --> 00:11:43.662
Well. I'll take all of you.
It'll be fun. Kids love me.

133
00:11:45.414 --> 00:11:47.416
Look. this isn't personal. I--

134
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.751
Despite what I said
about you being an asshole--

135
00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:53.297
Assholes used to be my type.
I just-- I don't date anymore.

136
00:11:53.964 --> 00:11:55.174
Anyone? Ever?

137
00:11:55.841 --> 00:11:58.302
No. Not till my girls grow up.

138
00:11:59.803 --> 00:12:00.804
Goodbye.

139
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:02.431
Okay.

140
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.059
- Your loss.
- Okay.

141
00:12:06.685 --> 00:12:08.562
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'm sure.

142
00:12:12.816 --> 00:12:15.110
Mommy. when is it gonna warm up?

143
00:12:15.819 --> 00:12:18.739
That is a great question. You know what?

144
00:12:23.493 --> 00:12:24.494
Soon.

145
00:12:24.995 --> 00:12:25.996
And if it doesn't.

146
00:12:25.996 --> 00:12:29.082
we're gonna go to Uncle Jeremy's.
stay the night there.

147
00:12:29.708 --> 00:12:31.043
He's not really our uncle.

148
00:12:31.793 --> 00:12:34.838
No. but he really is a Jeremy. I think.

149
00:12:36.757 --> 00:12:38.759
- We got it!
- Hang on. girls.

150
00:12:40.219 --> 00:12:42.846
- Are you Sheila Harper's daughters?
- Yeah. Who's asking?

151
00:12:42.846 --> 00:12:45.724
This is from Mr. Ty Warner.
He hopes that they're feeling better.

152
00:12:45.724 --> 00:12:47.643
- Okay. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

153
00:12:47.643 --> 00:12:48.936
- Thanks!
- Hang on.

154
00:12:48.936 --> 00:12:51.605
- What is it?
- I don't know. Let's find out.

155
00:12:51.605 --> 00:12:52.981
Let's get the door.

156
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:55.859
All right. Hang on. hang on.

157
00:12:56.652 --> 00:12:58.695
- Okay.
- Oh. my gosh!

158
00:12:58.695 --> 00:12:59.821
Oh. my God.

159
00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:02.241
<i>Ty was good at knowing what people wanted.</i>

160
00:13:02.241 --> 00:13:04.076
Wow. look at all of this.

161
00:13:15.587 --> 00:13:18.090
<i>First.
I wanted to be a wide receiver in the NFL.</i>

162
00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:23.345
Then I wanted to star in air shows.
I stole a crop plane to practice.

163
00:13:23.887 --> 00:13:27.307
Then I wanted to beat up Sam Walton.

164
00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:28.684
The Walmart guy?

165
00:13:28.684 --> 00:13:32.187
Walmart puts family stores
out of business.

166
00:13:32.187 --> 00:13:34.481
- Well. I think you could take him.
- Duh.

167
00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:38.443
Damn it.
I had so many plans back in Arkansas.

168
00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:42.072
Life was gonna be so fun
if I just got out into it.

169
00:13:43.323 --> 00:13:44.741
Like. I left--

170
00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:47.911
I left so that I wouldn't get stuck
taking care of people.

171
00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:51.540
I wanted to live my life for me.

172
00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:56.503
And here I am. This tub.

173
00:13:57.087 --> 00:13:58.505
Look at this.

174
00:13:58.505 --> 00:14:02.426
- It's like I'm my mother.
- Dad was hiding the good stuff.

175
00:14:03.135 --> 00:14:04.136
I like good stuff.

176
00:14:05.262 --> 00:14:07.222
- Scotch. Yeah.
- Me. Oh. yeah. yeah.

177
00:14:10.225 --> 00:14:11.226
So graceful.

178
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:16.481
We should be synchronized swimmers!

179
00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:17.858
- From now on.
- Robbie. Robbie.

180
00:14:17.858 --> 00:14:19.443
Listen to me.

181
00:14:19.443 --> 00:14:21.945
You can do anything you want.
You're not stuck.

182
00:14:22.487 --> 00:14:24.156
You're tough. and you're strong.

183
00:14:25.866 --> 00:14:27.659
Let's start our own business. you and me.

184
00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.288
A synchronized swimming business?

185
00:14:34.041 --> 00:14:36.418
A stuffed Himalayan cat business.

186
00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:44.009
A synchronized stuffed Himalayan
swimming business?

187
00:14:44.009 --> 00:14:46.053
- I'm serious. Well--
- Robbie!

188
00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:50.182
- Robbie. is that you?
- No!

189
00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:09.117
What?

190
00:15:10.619 --> 00:15:12.120
How are you even walking?

191
00:15:13.205 --> 00:15:19.878
I sold all my dad's antiques
so we could start

192
00:15:19.878 --> 00:15:23.298
our own business together.

193
00:15:25.342 --> 00:15:27.386
The swimming thing?

194
00:15:28.262 --> 00:15:31.431
The cats. Yeah. the stuffed cats.

195
00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:32.933
Don't you understand? This is happening.

196
00:15:32.933 --> 00:15:35.936
This is the first day of
the rest of your life. young lady.

197
00:15:35.936 --> 00:15:37.688
Could you just take it down a little bit?

198
00:15:37.688 --> 00:15:40.065
This is the first day of
the rest of your life.

199
00:15:45.112 --> 00:15:46.738
Here we are.

200
00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:50.659
- Okay. For you.
- Wow.

201
00:15:50.659 --> 00:15:52.786
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

202
00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:56.707
For you. It's hot. Hot. hot.

203
00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.501
And I like mine cold.

204
00:15:59.501 --> 00:16:01.670
You know.
we were supposed to be treating you.

205
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:03.589
Mr. Warner. this is very kind.

206
00:16:03.589 --> 00:16:07.342
Please. it's Ty. Mr. Warner was my dad.

207
00:16:07.342 --> 00:16:09.178
And his stuffed animals
weren't as cool as mine.

208
00:16:09.178 --> 00:16:10.387
Yours are so cool.

209
00:16:10.387 --> 00:16:13.223
Yours are the bestest best.

210
00:16:13.223 --> 00:16:15.184
Thank you very much.
Do you have a favorite?

211
00:16:15.184 --> 00:16:16.268
The pig.

212
00:16:16.268 --> 00:16:17.394
And the frog.

213
00:16:17.394 --> 00:16:19.396
I tried to bring it to school
for show-and-tell.

214
00:16:19.396 --> 00:16:21.148
but it wouldn't fit in my backpack.

215
00:16:21.148 --> 00:16:22.232
Oh. no.

216
00:16:24.109 --> 00:16:25.903
Well. I'm gonna have to
make a smaller one then.

217
00:16:26.403 --> 00:16:28.989
And maybe a little softer too.

218
00:16:28.989 --> 00:16:31.992
- Okay. let's stick to the thank-yous.
- Softer. Okay.

219
00:16:31.992 --> 00:16:33.410
- Hey. Ty?
- Yes. ma'am.

220
00:16:33.952 --> 00:16:36.205
Do you wanna go roller-skating
with us sometime?

221
00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:39.208
- I would love to.
- Honey. no. Okay.

222
00:16:39.208 --> 00:16:41.043
- I would love to.
- Can we. Mommy? Soon?

223
00:16:41.043 --> 00:16:42.794
Okay-- Well. I mean. Ty's a busy man.

224
00:16:42.794 --> 00:16:46.256
- so I don't know when he would find time.
- Listen. let's--

225
00:16:46.256 --> 00:16:48.800
- let's keep your mom out of this. okay?
- Okay.

226
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.136
I'll have my people contact your people.
How's that?

227
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:03.232
Ben. 9 and 11.

228
00:17:04.316 --> 00:17:06.652
- Thank you.
- Your left hands.

229
00:17:06.652 --> 00:17:09.238
- I declare a thumb war.
- Ladies.

230
00:17:09.238 --> 00:17:11.114
- Hi.
- Hey. There you are.

231
00:17:11.114 --> 00:17:12.199
- Hi.
- Hi. Ty.

232
00:17:12.199 --> 00:17:15.577
I have been looking forward to this
all week.

233
00:17:15.577 --> 00:17:20.790
And I brought a surprise.

234
00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:23.377
- Oh. my God. Froggy!
- It's a Beanie Baby.

235
00:17:23.377 --> 00:17:25.212
That's a miniature version
of your favorite.

236
00:17:25.212 --> 00:17:27.673
- I know.
- He's small enough to go everywhere.

237
00:17:27.673 --> 00:17:30.050
and he loves to ride in backpacks.

238
00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:32.845
Wow. then you can take him to school.

239
00:17:32.845 --> 00:17:34.096
What's his name?

240
00:17:34.096 --> 00:17:36.473
I don't know yet.
What does he look like to you?

241
00:17:38.308 --> 00:17:40.561
Can I take a closer look at him?

242
00:17:40.561 --> 00:17:42.646
What do you think he looks like?

243
00:17:42.646 --> 00:17:45.274
- Greenie.
- Greenie.

244
00:17:45.274 --> 00:17:47.192
Kids' 11 and 13. Sheila.

245
00:17:47.192 --> 00:17:49.152
- Yeah. That's us.
- Can you give us a minute?

246
00:17:49.152 --> 00:17:50.320
We're working here.

247
00:17:51.321 --> 00:17:52.322
All right.

248
00:17:53.657 --> 00:17:58.078
Why don't we name him Mar?

249
00:17:58.745 --> 00:18:00.330
- Mar?
- Yeah.

250
00:18:02.624 --> 00:18:05.794
I mean. Leaper's a great name.
I'm just not sold on it yet. but it's--

251
00:18:05.794 --> 00:18:07.337
What about Sir Jumps-a-Lot?

252
00:18:08.005 --> 00:18:09.089
That's a good one.

253
00:18:09.089 --> 00:18:11.717
Or maybe. like. Jumpy?

254
00:18:12.301 --> 00:18:13.760
- That's too on the nose. Jumpy.
- Jumpy.

255
00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.972
I dance with my arms.
I dance with my head.

256
00:18:16.972 --> 00:18:19.892
I dance with my butt.
I dance with my belly.

257
00:18:19.892 --> 00:18:22.769
I dance with my legs.
I dance with my arms.

258
00:18:22.769 --> 00:18:24.271
I dance with my belly.

259
00:18:24.771 --> 00:18:26.940
- Well. that's it.
- What?

260
00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.275
- Legs.
- What?

261
00:18:28.275 --> 00:18:29.568
Legs.

262
00:18:29.568 --> 00:18:30.652
- The name?
- What?

263
00:18:30.652 --> 00:18:32.404
- That's great. Legs.
- That's the name.

264
00:18:32.404 --> 00:18:35.490
- Legs the frog. I named it!
- Legs!

265
00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:37.826
- We have a name.
- Good work. ladies. Great.

266
00:18:37.826 --> 00:18:39.077
And I think

267
00:18:39.077 --> 00:18:42.414
- Legs has a friend.
- Oh. my gosh.

268
00:18:42.414 --> 00:18:44.166
We'll go roller-skating eventually.

269
00:18:45.042 --> 00:18:47.085
No. I think we're having a great time.

270
00:18:49.671 --> 00:18:51.048
Yeah. okay. Talk to you later.

271
00:18:51.048 --> 00:18:52.382
<i>Within a few months.</i>

272
00:18:52.382 --> 00:18:56.345
<i>Ty was completely obsessed
with his new Beanie Baby line.</i>

273
00:18:56.345 --> 00:18:58.430
<i>And working there was actually fun...</i>

274
00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:59.348
- Hey.
- Hey.

275
00:18:59.348 --> 00:19:02.142
<i>...'cause if he liked the way you think.
he'd listen to you.</i>

276
00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:03.685
- Hey.
-<i>No matter who you were.</i>

277
00:19:04.561 --> 00:19:06.605
<i>Case in point: his design team.</i>

278
00:19:07.314 --> 00:19:09.483
Hey. Ty. Like my ghost?

279
00:19:09.483 --> 00:19:11.693
- It's fantastic.
- Thank you.

280
00:19:14.863 --> 00:19:17.366
- First batch of puppies is here.
- Yeah.

281
00:19:20.369 --> 00:19:21.703
- Look at them.
- Cute.

282
00:19:21.703 --> 00:19:23.497
So cute! The face.

283
00:19:23.497 --> 00:19:25.207
Let them hug. Let's hug.

284
00:19:25.207 --> 00:19:27.084
I see you named him Dots.

285
00:19:27.084 --> 00:19:29.336
Oh. yeah. After much deliberation.

286
00:19:29.336 --> 00:19:30.838
Well. I dig it.

287
00:19:30.838 --> 00:19:33.507
It's just-- Don't you think
he should actually have some dots?

288
00:19:33.507 --> 00:19:34.675
It's a she.

289
00:19:35.259 --> 00:19:36.426
I'm sorry.

290
00:19:37.052 --> 00:19:39.346
I'm very sorry. ma'am.

291
00:19:39.346 --> 00:19:43.058
Well. you know what?
She definitely should have some dots.

292
00:19:43.058 --> 00:19:44.726
Maya's right. as usual.

293
00:19:45.435 --> 00:19:50.148
All right. ladies. For the next batch.
where should we put Dots's dots?

294
00:19:50.148 --> 00:19:51.233
On her butt!

295
00:19:51.233 --> 00:19:52.317
On the butt?

296
00:19:53.402 --> 00:19:55.654
- How many dots on the butt?
- A million.

297
00:19:55.654 --> 00:19:57.781
- A million dots?
- A million dots.

298
00:20:02.995 --> 00:20:06.498
<i>When Ty's Beanie Babies
were ready for their world debut.</i>

299
00:20:06.498 --> 00:20:09.084
<i>he put me in charge of
smaller trade shows.</i>

300
00:20:10.794 --> 00:20:12.379
<i>'Cause I rocked at selling stuff.</i>

301
00:20:15.215 --> 00:20:17.009
<i>I killed it.</i>

302
00:20:17.009 --> 00:20:19.428
<i>- I raked in the orders.</i>
- So soft.

303
00:20:19.428 --> 00:20:22.431
<i>For everything except Beanies.</i>

304
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.643
<i>Their big launch was a total flop.</i>

305
00:20:26.643 --> 00:20:28.937
<i>For two years.
we couldn't sell any at all.</i>

306
00:20:29.438 --> 00:20:31.106
<i>It drove Ty crazy.</i>

307
00:20:31.982 --> 00:20:33.442
What is this. a comic book stand?

308
00:20:33.442 --> 00:20:36.111
No. Ty Inc. is all about
high-quality stuffed animals.

309
00:20:36.111 --> 00:20:37.738
None of them are looking at me.

310
00:20:37.738 --> 00:20:38.947
What?

311
00:20:38.947 --> 00:20:42.242
These animals are supposed to be
making tantalizing eye contact with me.

312
00:20:43.202 --> 00:20:44.912
They're supposed to be alluringly tweezed.

313
00:20:44.912 --> 00:20:46.622
Yeah. you should go blond more often. Ty.

314
00:20:46.622 --> 00:20:49.208
- It really brings out your cheekbones.
- I'm undercover.

315
00:20:50.626 --> 00:20:53.504
- Why aren't you wearing something sparkly?
- This is my version of sparkly.

316
00:20:54.713 --> 00:20:56.006
How are sales?

317
00:20:56.006 --> 00:20:58.592
Good. Well. except for Beanies.

318
00:20:58.592 --> 00:21:01.094
Though there have been
a lot of requests for Woolly.

319
00:21:01.094 --> 00:21:03.847
Maya.
if you can't sell what we actually have.

320
00:21:03.847 --> 00:21:07.768
I'm gonna have to find someone that can.
Someone a little bit more focused.

321
00:21:10.646 --> 00:21:14.399
Hi. I'd like my regular order.
plus a batch of those cheap little lambs.

322
00:21:15.025 --> 00:21:16.235
Do you still have those?

323
00:21:18.195 --> 00:21:21.823
That design has been retired.
That was a special limited edition.

324
00:21:22.574 --> 00:21:24.535
- A what?
- A limited edition.

325
00:21:24.535 --> 00:21:27.329
If you still have some.
they're pretty valuable.

326
00:21:27.329 --> 00:21:31.041
You know. the first issue of <i>Action Comics</i>
sells for over a million dollars.

327
00:21:32.918 --> 00:21:35.921
Are any of these others.
limited editions too?

328
00:21:35.921 --> 00:21:39.466
Yep. All the Beanie Babies are.
Be a good idea to stock up.

329
00:21:39.466 --> 00:21:41.885
{\an8}Okay. Put me down for five of each.

330
00:21:41.885 --> 00:21:42.970
{\an8}Frank Carlson.

331
00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:45.973
Uncle Frank's Toys in Glenview. I know.
I got you.

332
00:21:45.973 --> 00:21:47.057
Thank you.

333
00:21:51.061 --> 00:21:54.940
-"Retired." That's genius.
- Limited editions always get people.

334
00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.900
I love it. It's fantastic.

335
00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.819
Get this comic book off the table. please.

336
00:22:01.238 --> 00:22:04.825
So you're being an assistant
to some man selling worthless toys.

337
00:22:04.825 --> 00:22:06.994
instead of studying full-time
to be a surgeon?

338
00:22:06.994 --> 00:22:08.996
- Yep.
- Fascinating.

339
00:22:08.996 --> 00:22:10.289
After we sacrificed so much

340
00:22:10.289 --> 00:22:12.624
to come to a country
where women can do anything they want.

341
00:22:12.624 --> 00:22:15.544
Exactly.
Anything they want. not their parents.

342
00:22:15.544 --> 00:22:18.130
- And I'm still in school. don't freak.
- Do I look like a freaker?

343
00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:21.341
- I mean. you do kind of freak out--
- Not a word from you. mister.

344
00:22:21.341 --> 00:22:23.886
Okay. come on.
I don't have all day to help my daughter

345
00:22:23.886 --> 00:22:26.388
shatter her parents' hearts
into a thousand tiny pieces.

346
00:22:26.388 --> 00:22:31.393
- My new place is a mile away. Dad.
- 1.000 tiny. irreparable pieces.

347
00:22:33.103 --> 00:22:34.188
So dramatic.

348
00:22:38.734 --> 00:22:42.362
You wanna sell
high-end stuffed Himalayan cats?

349
00:22:42.362 --> 00:22:45.032
Understuffed. actually.
For greater posability.

350
00:22:45.032 --> 00:22:48.076
It's a revolutionary new design
that's going to electrify the market.

351
00:22:48.076 --> 00:22:51.038
I assume you're aware
that the current economic conditions

352
00:22:51.038 --> 00:22:53.165
{\an8}are crippling stagnation.

353
00:22:53.165 --> 00:22:56.126
<i>soaring inflation and record unemployment.</i>

354
00:22:56.126 --> 00:22:59.713
Which makes this the perfect time
to sell a little joy.

355
00:23:00.547 --> 00:23:03.675
We're professionals.
We're giving the people what they need.

356
00:23:09.306 --> 00:23:10.849
I'll draw up the paperwork.

357
00:23:14.228 --> 00:23:16.772
<i>And just like that. Ty Inc. was born.</i>

358
00:23:18.732 --> 00:23:20.067
- See here?
- Yeah.

359
00:23:20.067 --> 00:23:22.903
- The threading is not--
- Well. you can see it right there.

360
00:23:22.903 --> 00:23:25.405
Now. this is what we call the... stitch.

361
00:23:25.405 --> 00:23:27.783
<i>Ty taught me everything
about stuffed animals.</i>

362
00:23:27.783 --> 00:23:30.285
<i>which hadn't changed much in 50 years.</i>

363
00:23:30.869 --> 00:23:34.081
<i>They'd been made pretty firm.
stuffed to the seams.</i>

364
00:23:34.748 --> 00:23:38.126
<i>His big idea? Make 'em softer. Posable.</i>

365
00:23:38.126 --> 00:23:39.628
This is. like. a old lady and...

366
00:23:39.628 --> 00:23:42.381
<i>I was a fast learner.
And I had a thing or two to teach him.</i>

367
00:23:42.381 --> 00:23:43.924
- It's so boring.
- This one works.

368
00:23:43.924 --> 00:23:47.177
- Look at this. Look at this. That's it.
- Doesn't work.

369
00:23:47.177 --> 00:23:49.888
Open. open. Hurry. hurry.

370
00:23:50.556 --> 00:23:51.557
<i>We were a good team.</i>

371
00:23:51.557 --> 00:23:52.641
It's good.

372
00:23:53.433 --> 00:23:56.019
It's good! I love it!

373
00:23:56.019 --> 00:23:58.355
Robbie! Hey!

374
00:23:58.355 --> 00:24:00.524
<i>Turns out I was born for this shit.</i>

375
00:24:00.524 --> 00:24:01.942
{\an8}Yeah. I hear you!

376
00:24:02.943 --> 00:24:04.695
{\an8}Robbie! Hey. Robbie!

377
00:24:04.695 --> 00:24:06.655
{\an8}J-- One sec!

378
00:24:06.655 --> 00:24:11.243
One. One each. Oh. my God. One.

379
00:24:12.828 --> 00:24:15.789
Who knew it only took
inventing a line of stuffed animals

380
00:24:15.789 --> 00:24:17.875
to break your strict dating embargo?

381
00:24:19.251 --> 00:24:22.171
- It took way more than that.
- Did it?

382
00:24:22.171 --> 00:24:25.382
Yeah.
And they're understuffed. by the way.

383
00:24:26.091 --> 00:24:28.218
One of his many innovations.

384
00:24:31.054 --> 00:24:32.389
You seem kinda happy.

385
00:24:33.307 --> 00:24:35.184
I don't know. Ty's different. He's--

386
00:24:36.518 --> 00:24:41.273
He's strange and magical.
and the girls. they love him.

387
00:24:41.273 --> 00:24:43.108
And you?

388
00:24:43.734 --> 00:24:45.194
They love me too.

389
00:24:48.572 --> 00:24:49.615
Wow.

390
00:24:49.615 --> 00:24:52.492
- Is that the one she designed?
- Yeah. I brought you one.

391
00:24:52.993 --> 00:24:55.579
- Here.
- Look at this.

392
00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:58.248
{\an8}It's got her name in it.

393
00:24:59.249 --> 00:25:01.168
Look at his cute little dots!

394
00:25:01.168 --> 00:25:02.669
Oh. my goodness.

395
00:25:03.504 --> 00:25:05.714
- These are adorable.
- Our friend. Ty. makes them.

396
00:25:05.714 --> 00:25:06.798
I designed Spooky.

397
00:25:06.798 --> 00:25:08.091
Really?

398
00:25:08.091 --> 00:25:09.051
- Yeah.
- Wow.

399
00:25:12.054 --> 00:25:13.931
Little poems inside their tags.

400
00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:16.141
How darling.

401
00:25:18.268 --> 00:25:19.102
Girls.

402
00:25:23.524 --> 00:25:26.151
<i>Our little world
was getting better and happier.</i>

403
00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:31.198
<i>Before we knew it. we were a family.</i>

404
00:25:31.782 --> 00:25:35.202
<i>A funny. weird. happy family.</i>

405
00:25:41.959 --> 00:25:43.168
You a doctor yet?

406
00:25:44.294 --> 00:25:45.712
It's so boring.

407
00:25:46.213 --> 00:25:48.465
If it weren't for computer science.
I'd kill myself.

408
00:25:49.174 --> 00:25:52.594
Good news is. Stripes turned out great.
Wanna hear?

409
00:25:52.594 --> 00:25:53.929
Nope.

410
00:25:53.929 --> 00:25:56.139
<i>My name is Stripes
And I'm fun to snuggle</i>

411
00:25:56.139 --> 00:25:58.433
<i>I was born too soft
For the jungle struggle</i>

412
00:25:58.433 --> 00:26:01.144
<i>So. I packed my bags. waved goodbye</i>

413
00:26:01.144 --> 00:26:03.480
<i>And came to live with my friends at Ty</i>

414
00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:07.442
I still can't believe
Ty let you print raps on their tags.

415
00:26:07.442 --> 00:26:09.486
Poems. Rose. This is poetry.

416
00:26:09.486 --> 00:26:10.571
Uh-huh.

417
00:26:11.572 --> 00:26:14.283
Stripes has a birthday coming up.
Should we blow it out?

418
00:26:14.283 --> 00:26:18.328
You're doing something right.
Regional Beanie sales are way up.

419
00:26:18.996 --> 00:26:19.997
For real?

420
00:26:22.833 --> 00:26:23.876
No "piggity"?

421
00:26:24.918 --> 00:26:28.088
If you start with puns.
I might actually have to punch you.

422
00:26:29.339 --> 00:26:30.340
All right.

423
00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:32.551
My bat.

424
00:26:34.261 --> 00:26:35.762
- Bird up!
- Okay.

425
00:26:35.762 --> 00:26:38.390
No. come on. I'm just kitten around.

426
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:39.474
All right.

427
00:26:40.601 --> 00:26:41.685
Watch out.

428
00:26:42.311 --> 00:26:43.604
What the fox?

429
00:26:46.607 --> 00:26:48.442
Hey. This is unbearable.

430
00:26:52.988 --> 00:26:55.866
<i>The local surge had started
in a small suburban neighborhood</i>

431
00:26:55.866 --> 00:26:58.785
<i>outside of Chicago.
just after the holidays.</i>

432
00:27:00.746 --> 00:27:04.166
<i>Some kids who'd gotten Beanies brought
them to school and showed them off.</i>

433
00:27:05.167 --> 00:27:08.337
<i>It wasn't long before
some parents got pretty into them too.</i>

434
00:27:09.755 --> 00:27:11.632
<i>Three of them
lived on the same cul-de-sac.</i>

435
00:27:11.632 --> 00:27:13.509
<i>Two were named Linda.</i>

436
00:27:14.009 --> 00:27:17.137
<i>All of them started Beanie hunting
at the local toy store.</i>

437
00:27:18.972 --> 00:27:22.267
<i>Frank even published a checklist.
which brought out the crazy.</i>

438
00:27:23.435 --> 00:27:26.438
<i>'Cause once you have a checklist.
it's no longer about what you have.</i>

439
00:27:27.481 --> 00:27:29.316
<i>It's all about what you don't have.</i>

440
00:27:34.821 --> 00:27:37.491
<i>Initially. the regional boom
was all word of mouth.</i>

441
00:27:38.492 --> 00:27:40.827
<i>'cause Ty didn't buy TV ads.</i>

442
00:27:40.827 --> 00:27:44.164
<i>But word of mouth was about to get
a hell of a megaphone.</i>

443
00:27:45.165 --> 00:27:48.168
In summary.
the Midwest market is going bananas.

444
00:27:51.672 --> 00:27:52.673
Hey.

445
00:27:52.673 --> 00:27:54.424
Bravo. Exciting.

446
00:27:54.424 --> 00:27:55.801
- Exciting. right?
- Yes.

447
00:27:55.801 --> 00:27:58.846
Hey. did you get a chance to check out
that modem I left for you yet?

448
00:27:58.846 --> 00:28:00.180
- The what-em?
- Modem.

449
00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:03.559
That little computer box I put in your
office that connects you to the Internet?

450
00:28:04.309 --> 00:28:06.603
All of these messages
are about Beanie Babies?

451
00:28:06.603 --> 00:28:08.814
This whole section is Beanie Baby boards.

452
00:28:08.814 --> 00:28:10.983
Everyone writing on here
is writing about them.

453
00:28:13.277 --> 00:28:14.862
But how do they all know each other?

454
00:28:16.113 --> 00:28:19.616
Well. they don't.
It's kinda like a big conference call.

455
00:28:20.158 --> 00:28:22.494
We're dialed into this thing
called America Online.

456
00:28:22.494 --> 00:28:24.037
and so is everyone else here.

457
00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:26.039
Can we go back to the chat pad thing?

458
00:28:26.039 --> 00:28:27.124
Chat room.

459
00:28:27.124 --> 00:28:28.208
Okay.

460
00:28:40.429 --> 00:28:42.222
- It's so fast.
- Right?

461
00:28:43.015 --> 00:28:45.767
- Look at that. There's new thingies.
- Yeah. All the time.

462
00:28:45.767 --> 00:28:48.729
We're just watching Beanie lovers
hang out in real time.

463
00:28:50.022 --> 00:28:52.941
Even if they're in different
cities. time zones. Wherever.

464
00:28:52.941 --> 00:28:55.527
How many people
are into this sort of thing overall?

465
00:28:55.527 --> 00:28:59.323
My professor says 18 million homes
now have modem-equipped computers.

466
00:28:59.323 --> 00:29:01.033
- up from 11 million a year ago...
- What?

467
00:29:01.033 --> 00:29:02.993
...and that number's gonna keep growing.

468
00:29:02.993 --> 00:29:05.621
Wow. 18 million people
just talking about Beanie Babies.

469
00:29:06.205 --> 00:29:08.040
Well. and other things.

470
00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:11.585
I mean. the Internet's a whole new way of
connecting to the rest of the world.

471
00:29:11.585 --> 00:29:12.669
It's amazing.

472
00:29:13.879 --> 00:29:15.589
We really should start a Ty web page.

473
00:29:16.173 --> 00:29:17.174
What's that?

474
00:29:17.174 --> 00:29:18.258
We can make a place

475
00:29:18.258 --> 00:29:21.678
that anyone who wants to know
anything about Beanie Babies can go to.

476
00:29:21.678 --> 00:29:23.597
A place we control.

477
00:29:25.307 --> 00:29:26.141
Completely?

478
00:29:26.141 --> 00:29:29.269
And we'd probably be the first business
to make one for our customers.

479
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:31.104
'cause no one else is using it that way.

480
00:29:31.104 --> 00:29:35.067
Most web pages are just boring academic
stuff and phone directories.

481
00:29:35.067 --> 00:29:36.735
but we could make ours fun.

482
00:29:37.236 --> 00:29:39.696
Different. Sparkly.

483
00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.032
Sparkly. I like that.

484
00:29:43.158 --> 00:29:46.203
- Wait. Your version of sparkly or mine?
- Yours.

485
00:29:49.831 --> 00:29:52.626
Are these toy shindigs fancy?

486
00:29:52.626 --> 00:29:57.089
Ty says we have to put on a show
and "pack something flashy." so...

487
00:29:58.799 --> 00:30:02.636
Is he gonna wear a dress also or does
he not do that sort of thing in public?

488
00:30:02.636 --> 00:30:04.429
He is not a cross-dresser.

489
00:30:04.429 --> 00:30:07.891
Yeah. well. he is the kinda guy
who's hiding who he really is.

490
00:30:07.891 --> 00:30:10.686
Ty had a rough life too. you know.
but he's going after things.

491
00:30:10.686 --> 00:30:13.397
He's making things happen.
getting what he deserves.

492
00:30:13.397 --> 00:30:16.567
- It's inspiring.
- Uh-huh.

493
00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:22.072
For once. I feel like I'm being
pulled up. not just dragged down.

494
00:30:22.573 --> 00:30:23.907
It's a fucking miracle.

495
00:30:27.452 --> 00:30:30.414
- I didn't mean-- I meant work stuff.
- It's fine. It's fine.

496
00:30:30.414 --> 00:30:31.999
You're allowed to go have fun.

497
00:30:38.255 --> 00:30:40.716
It's nice feeling
like someone believes in me.

498
00:30:42.968 --> 00:30:43.969
That's all I meant.

499
00:30:45.053 --> 00:30:47.723
Well. you'll have to tell me
what that feels like.

500
00:30:51.393 --> 00:30:54.188
I made you a lasagna.
and there's pizza too.

501
00:30:54.188 --> 00:30:56.690
And I'll only be gone for two days. Okay?

502
00:30:57.191 --> 00:30:59.151
- Make it longer.
- You know what. Billy?

503
00:30:59.151 --> 00:31:01.695
- I'm fucking trying to do s--
- No. I'm serious. okay?

504
00:31:01.695 --> 00:31:04.239
Let's stop fucking pretending.
I'm sick of it.

505
00:31:05.365 --> 00:31:07.618
You're not the only one
who's feeling fucking suffocated.

506
00:31:20.047 --> 00:31:22.508
- Checking in?
- Yes. Roberta Jones.

507
00:31:22.508 --> 00:31:24.676
- I'm-- The toy convention?
- Welcome.

508
00:31:28.889 --> 00:31:30.432
Here's your keys.

509
00:31:30.432 --> 00:31:31.892
And Mr. Warner left you a note.

510
00:31:31.892 --> 00:31:35.395
He said to tell you he's "fetching
a chariot to collect you at 3:00."

511
00:31:35.979 --> 00:31:37.022
And he left you this.

512
00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:28.490
Give them a look and give them a try.

513
00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:31.076
There you go. What do you think? Not bad?

514
00:32:31.076 --> 00:32:33.287
- Let me grab that from you.
- Not bad.

515
00:32:33.287 --> 00:32:34.746
That's great.

516
00:32:34.746 --> 00:32:37.291
- This is not your dad's stuffed animal.
- Enjoy your day.

517
00:32:37.791 --> 00:32:41.253
Fifty-two poses for the head alone.

518
00:32:46.967 --> 00:32:50.304
Thirty fucking thousand dollars!

519
00:32:52.681 --> 00:32:55.225
In an hour! For stuffed cats!

520
00:32:55.225 --> 00:32:58.395
We are great together.
just like I said we would be.

521
00:32:58.395 --> 00:33:00.731
- Fucking great.
- Ship-building champs. we are!

522
00:33:01.315 --> 00:33:03.692
Motherfucking Vikings!

523
00:33:04.193 --> 00:33:05.194
Hotel. please.

524
00:33:07.154 --> 00:33:09.448
You're one in a million. Robbie Jones.

525
00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:11.491
You are.

526
00:33:54.743 --> 00:33:55.744
Oh. God.

527
00:34:05.838 --> 00:34:07.798
Do you know what the greatest thing
about America is?

528
00:34:07.798 --> 00:34:10.050
- Toys!
- Milkshakes!

529
00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:13.679
Well. that's number-- Yes.
Number seven and 14. of course.

530
00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:16.473
But the number one
greatest thing about America?

531
00:34:16.473 --> 00:34:21.103
It's the land of comebacks.
of new chances. of opportunity.

532
00:34:22.145 --> 00:34:25.065
You can make things happen here
like nowhere else. ladies.

533
00:34:25.065 --> 00:34:26.775
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

534
00:34:26.775 --> 00:34:32.447
And never forget that you
have the power to create your own future.

535
00:34:33.282 --> 00:34:35.742
Never forget that you can be anything.

536
00:34:35.742 --> 00:34:38.579
- you can do anything.
- I'm gonna be a unicorn!

537
00:34:38.579 --> 00:34:41.164
You already are. darling. You already are.

538
00:34:41.164 --> 00:34:46.210
The past few years have been
just the greatest ever.

539
00:34:47.795 --> 00:34:50.257
I think we make an unbeatable team.
I think we do.

540
00:34:50.257 --> 00:34:51.800
- We make an unbeatable team.
- Yeah.

541
00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.844
- Me too.
- Me three.

542
00:34:53.844 --> 00:34:54.928
Me four.

543
00:34:55.888 --> 00:34:59.725
And I think some really amazing things...
You ready?

544
00:35:01.268 --> 00:35:03.812
I think some amazing things
are getting ready to happen.

545
00:35:04.313 --> 00:35:05.689
Can we do it now?

546
00:35:06.607 --> 00:35:07.608
Ladies.

547
00:35:09.359 --> 00:35:11.195
What is happening?

548
00:35:11.945 --> 00:35:16.241
<i>Oh. oh</i>

549
00:35:16.241 --> 00:35:17.326
What?

550
00:35:19.328 --> 00:35:22.456
<i>Oh Oh. Sheila</i>

551
00:35:22.456 --> 00:35:24.750
<i>Let me love you till the morning comes</i>

552
00:35:25.667 --> 00:35:26.668
Oh. my--

553
00:35:26.668 --> 00:35:30.005
<i>Oh Oh. Sheila</i>

554
00:35:30.005 --> 00:35:32.716
<i>You know I want to be the only one</i>

555
00:35:34.134 --> 00:35:37.346
<i>Oh. baby. love me right</i>

556
00:35:37.346 --> 00:35:39.640
<i>Let me love you till we get it right</i>

557
00:35:42.392 --> 00:35:44.978
<i>Why can't you let the others be?</i>

558
00:35:44.978 --> 00:35:48.899
<i>'Cause with you is where I wanna be Yeah</i>

559
00:35:48.899 --> 00:35:52.110
<i>Oh Oh. Sheila</i>

560
00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:55.906
<i>Let me love you till the morning comes
Oh. Sheila</i>

561
00:35:56.532 --> 00:35:59.535
<i>Oh Oh. Sheila</i>

562
00:35:59.535 --> 00:36:03.288
<i>You know I want to be the only one
Oh. Sheila</i>

563
00:36:03.288 --> 00:36:05.415
-<i>Here we go</i>
- Oh. my God.

564
00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:10.045
Sheila Marie Harper.
will you make me the happiest man alive?

565
00:36:10.712 --> 00:36:12.881
Say yes!

566
00:36:12.881 --> 00:36:15.634
Yes. Of course.

567
00:36:15.634 --> 00:36:16.802
Mommy!

568
00:36:18.053 --> 00:36:19.805
She said yes!

569
00:36:19.805 --> 00:36:20.889
Yay!

570
00:36:32.776 --> 00:36:37.406
You know. I thought it was just gonna be
me and the girls till they left home.

571
00:36:38.824 --> 00:36:40.784
Man. did you screw with my plans.

572
00:36:42.828 --> 00:36:46.039
Well. get ready for me to screw
with your plans for the rest of our lives.

573
00:36:50.085 --> 00:36:53.714
You know. this is serious.
what we're doing.

574
00:36:57.885 --> 00:37:00.137
- You're not reconsidering. are you?
- No.

575
00:37:01.305 --> 00:37:03.015
No. No. sweetheart.

576
00:37:03.015 --> 00:37:05.726
I just--

577
00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:12.316
In the past. I have relied on men.

578
00:37:13.233 --> 00:37:15.277
and they turned out to be the wrong men.

579
00:37:19.031 --> 00:37:20.657
I would die before I let you down.

580
00:37:28.916 --> 00:37:32.252
You know. I don't need this.

581
00:37:32.252 --> 00:37:35.172
I don't need to get married.

582
00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:37.591
Well. I do.

583
00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.432
- You feel that. right?
- Yeah.

584
00:37:45.432 --> 00:37:49.895
Your face-lift scar
from just before we met.

585
00:37:49.895 --> 00:37:52.356
'Cause I was ready for a fresh start.

586
00:37:52.356 --> 00:37:53.565
Wow.

587
00:37:54.066 --> 00:37:57.778
You know. I never knew
that plastic surgery could be so romantic.

588
00:38:00.948 --> 00:38:04.952
My life had gone bad...

589
00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:09.581
before you.

590
00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:13.502
And now it is more wonderful than ever.

591
00:38:15.462 --> 00:38:20.676
And I cannot wait
until you become Mrs. Warner.

592
00:38:21.677 --> 00:38:24.388
Mrs. H. Ty Warner.

593
00:38:25.389 --> 00:38:27.224
You know that I'm keeping
my own name though. right?

594
00:38:28.725 --> 00:38:29.768
Right.

595
00:38:31.019 --> 00:38:34.231
Well. whoever you are.
whatever your name is.

596
00:38:34.731 --> 00:38:37.025
we should get married
and grow old together.

597
00:38:40.571 --> 00:38:41.613
Deal.

598
00:38:43.866 --> 00:38:44.950
<i>Kumar residence.</i>

599
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:47.369
I was hoping you'd answer.
I've got exams all morning.

600
00:38:47.369 --> 00:38:48.996
Could you update the site at 11:00?

601
00:38:48.996 --> 00:38:51.582
Yeah. I could go to the library
in between my classes.

602
00:38:51.582 --> 00:38:52.875
<i>Awesome. Thanks.</i>

603
00:38:52.875 --> 00:38:54.168
I swapped Peanut in this morning.

604
00:38:54.168 --> 00:38:57.087
He needs to drop a hint about Digger
tunneling out of the Beanie nursery.

605
00:38:57.087 --> 00:38:58.922
The collectors are gonna go crazy.

606
00:38:59.673 --> 00:39:02.301
Hey. did you check out
that new auction website I told you about?

607
00:39:02.301 --> 00:39:05.762
No. Shit. I meant to. I'll do that today.

608
00:39:05.762 --> 00:39:07.639
-"ePort" or some shit?
-<i>eBay.</i>

609
00:39:07.639 --> 00:39:10.142
eBay. Right.

610
00:39:11.101 --> 00:39:12.311
Crap. I'm so late.

611
00:39:12.311 --> 00:39:14.313
-<i>Because of the Peanut crab?</i>
- Wha-- Mom?

612
00:39:14.313 --> 00:39:16.440
Shit. Shit. shit. shit. shit. shit. shit.

613
00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:18.233
<i>Who are you shit-shit-shitting?</i>

614
00:39:18.233 --> 00:39:19.902
<i>There is no shit-shit-shitting
in this family.</i>

615
00:39:19.902 --> 00:39:21.653
Sorry. she must have
picked up the extension.

616
00:39:21.653 --> 00:39:24.448
<i>No shit. Sherlock.
Get to school. both of you.</i>

617
00:39:24.448 --> 00:39:25.908
Yes. ma'am.

618
00:40:09.159 --> 00:40:10.869
All right. gremlins. time-out!

619
00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:13.330
- Hey. Maya. Come on in.
- Hi.

620
00:40:15.082 --> 00:40:17.709
You know. you made Ty's year
with that new computer setup.

621
00:40:17.709 --> 00:40:20.629
He won't stop talking about his RAM.

622
00:40:21.129 --> 00:40:22.172
Sorry.

623
00:40:22.172 --> 00:40:23.632
He's just through here.

624
00:40:25.676 --> 00:40:28.595
Wow. So cute.

625
00:40:29.179 --> 00:40:30.806
We spotted an enemy!

626
00:40:30.806 --> 00:40:34.017
- Not so cute. Warmongers.
- Yes. yes. yes!

627
00:40:34.017 --> 00:40:35.686
- Hey. Look who's here.
- Hi.

628
00:40:36.979 --> 00:40:38.647
200 new thingies since noon.

629
00:40:38.647 --> 00:40:40.440
I've got something even more exciting
to show you.

630
00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:41.942
- Now you're trapped!
- Hey. Come on.

631
00:40:41.942 --> 00:40:43.318
- Rascals.
- Sorry.

632
00:40:43.318 --> 00:40:46.196
Okay. dazzle me.
Show me what couldn't wait till tomorrow.

633
00:40:49.157 --> 00:40:50.868
You are not gonna believe this.

634
00:40:51.869 --> 00:40:52.786
May I?

635
00:40:53.287 --> 00:40:54.288
I'm sorry.

636
00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:58.625
Okay.

637
00:41:00.335 --> 00:41:02.588
- Come on.
- One sec.

638
00:41:05.257 --> 00:41:06.258
Here.

639
00:41:10.429 --> 00:41:13.640
Why are there photos and prices
of retired Beanie Babies on here?

640
00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:16.560
- They can't sell these.
- No. these aren't retailers.

641
00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:17.686
They're customers.

642
00:41:17.686 --> 00:41:19.813
reselling what they've already
bought from us.

643
00:41:20.355 --> 00:41:23.025
It's an online auction site.
a genius idea.

644
00:41:23.025 --> 00:41:26.445
Anybody can sell anything they want.
but we're the biggest thing on it.

645
00:41:26.445 --> 00:41:27.863
By a lot. Look.

646
00:41:27.863 --> 00:41:32.534
Dotless Dots is listed at $55.
11 times retail.

647
00:41:32.534 --> 00:41:35.245
- Well. we should sue them then.
- Well-- No. we-- What?

648
00:41:35.245 --> 00:41:36.538
We should kiss them.

649
00:41:36.538 --> 00:41:38.665
Are you seeing what they're doing for us?

650
00:41:38.665 --> 00:41:41.502
Yes. They're making a huge profit
on my products.

651
00:41:41.502 --> 00:41:44.254
Infringing on my trademarked--

652
00:41:44.254 --> 00:41:46.965
- trademarked name.
- No. making everybody greedy

653
00:41:46.965 --> 00:41:48.425
for what we sell.

654
00:41:48.425 --> 00:41:51.720
Not just as toys. but as investments.
As money makers.

655
00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:54.723
I mean. we could not pay
for this kind of marketing.

656
00:41:54.723 --> 00:41:57.976
These photos are just awful.

657
00:41:58.477 --> 00:42:01.063
I mean. amateur camera angles.
abysmal eye con--

658
00:42:01.063 --> 00:42:02.940
Look at the eye contact. There's none.

659
00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:05.526
Zero. This is a disgrace.

660
00:42:05.526 --> 00:42:08.612
The disgrace that's gonna
multiply our sales by a zillion.

661
00:42:11.490 --> 00:42:13.033
Well. maybe we won't sue.

662
00:42:13.659 --> 00:42:15.744
Yeah. This is a big deal. Ty.

663
00:42:16.453 --> 00:42:17.538
We gotta play it right.

664
00:42:17.538 --> 00:42:21.041
Okay. listen though.
I'm way too busy to handle all this crap.

665
00:42:21.583 --> 00:42:23.293
You're gonna have to manage it. okay?

666
00:42:23.293 --> 00:42:25.087
- Yeah. Plan to.
- Okay.

667
00:42:25.087 --> 00:42:27.381
I'm deferring med school
to come on board full-time.

668
00:42:28.382 --> 00:42:29.466
You're still in school?

669
00:42:30.384 --> 00:42:33.387
You know I am.
My parents want me to be a doctor.

670
00:42:33.387 --> 00:42:36.431
Doctors are a dime a dozen.
You are special.

671
00:42:36.431 --> 00:42:38.475
You don't need degrees to succeed.

672
00:42:38.475 --> 00:42:40.894
Tell your folks
that all the greats quit school early.

673
00:42:40.894 --> 00:42:42.354
I quit my freshman year.

674
00:42:42.354 --> 00:42:45.524
Yeah. Like you said. all the greats.

675
00:42:45.524 --> 00:42:47.484
We're a great team. Maya Kumar.

676
00:42:48.527 --> 00:42:49.528
Yes. we are.

677
00:42:50.863 --> 00:42:55.284
We are a dream team. Robbie Jones. Unbeatable.

678
00:42:56.702 --> 00:42:57.995
It's the cats!

679
00:42:58.954 --> 00:43:02.332
Oh. God. Keep the fatties away.
We don't want fatties near the booth.

680
00:43:05.419 --> 00:43:06.587
Are you joking?

681
00:43:06.587 --> 00:43:08.297
No. they sweat on the fur.

682
00:43:09.256 --> 00:43:11.675
Everyone is talking up this booth.

683
00:43:12.676 --> 00:43:13.719
Can I help you?

684
00:43:14.219 --> 00:43:15.596
These are incredible.

685
00:43:15.596 --> 00:43:18.390
They're so lifelike. and they're soft.

686
00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:21.018
What a good idea.
under-stuffing them like this.

687
00:43:21.018 --> 00:43:23.729
Thank you.
Can I get an order started for you?

688
00:43:23.729 --> 00:43:25.022
- For sure.
- Great.

689
00:43:25.022 --> 00:43:27.399
- I'll take two dozen for my store.
- Wonderful.

690
00:43:27.399 --> 00:43:29.943
And a few for my kids.
They will just die for these.

691
00:43:44.208 --> 00:43:45.626
I love that.

692
00:44:05.145 --> 00:44:07.481
Oh. my God. I love this.

693
00:44:46.979 --> 00:44:49.898
<i>It's amazing how quick ten years can go.</i>

694
00:44:51.817 --> 00:44:55.529
<i>By '92. we'd built a six-million-dollar
business together from scratch.</i>

695
00:44:55.529 --> 00:44:56.822
<i>broken up five times.</i>

696
00:44:56.822 --> 00:44:59.408
<i>and felt like we were
just getting started.</i>

697
00:45:00.409 --> 00:45:02.327
You are one of a kind. Robbie Jones.

698
00:45:02.327 --> 00:45:04.454
- One of a kind.
- Back at ya. Ty.

699
00:45:05.205 --> 00:45:06.790
Though I can't believe you're
from Arkansas

700
00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:08.250
and you've never met Clinton.

701
00:45:09.251 --> 00:45:11.170
- Do you think he's gonna win?
- Yeah.

702
00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:13.797
- He's younger than I am.
- And taller.

703
00:45:15.716 --> 00:45:16.884
And he has a kid.

704
00:45:18.594 --> 00:45:21.805
Do you think we should have kids?

705
00:45:21.805 --> 00:45:23.390
You're probably too old though.

706
00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:25.225
We have a lot on our plate already.
don't you think?

707
00:45:25.225 --> 00:45:27.269
I mean. we're birthing an empire.

708
00:45:28.353 --> 00:45:33.692
Listen. I think that we should
expand internationally.

709
00:45:33.692 --> 00:45:35.319
- What? No. No.
- Yes.

710
00:45:35.319 --> 00:45:36.737
- Yes. Yes.
- No.

711
00:45:36.737 --> 00:45:39.865
The market is perfect
for us to move into the UK.

712
00:45:39.865 --> 00:45:41.950
- Plus. it'll stimulate domestic.
- I said no.

713
00:45:43.869 --> 00:45:46.580
The number one mistake
that people make is they get too greedy.

714
00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:48.498
They start expanding too fast.

715
00:45:49.166 --> 00:45:50.375
Plus. I'm loyal to America.

716
00:45:50.375 --> 00:45:52.920
Okay.
what does that have to do with anything?

717
00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:57.049
My products are made
by Americans for Americans. end of story.

718
00:45:57.799 --> 00:46:02.137
Our products are made
for Americans by Asians.

719
00:46:02.137 --> 00:46:04.848
Ty Inc.'s plush animals
are manufactured in China

720
00:46:04.848 --> 00:46:06.350
- and Korea. as you well know.
- Yeah.

721
00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:09.603
Paying us back for all the bills
America's paid for the entire world.

722
00:46:09.603 --> 00:46:10.729
and I think it's about time.

723
00:46:10.729 --> 00:46:12.523
If you want other countries to pay us.

724
00:46:12.523 --> 00:46:14.691
then we need to sell to them.
not buy from them.

725
00:46:14.691 --> 00:46:18.862
And I am proposing
that we figure out how to sell to Europe.

726
00:46:18.862 --> 00:46:20.864
Don't double-cross America. Robbie.

727
00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:23.325
- I'm being serious.
- Okay.

728
00:46:23.325 --> 00:46:25.077
- No. I am.
- I know. I hear.

729
00:46:26.286 --> 00:46:28.914
You just sit there looking pretty.
okay. Paul Revere?

730
00:46:28.914 --> 00:46:30.249
I'll be over here.

731
00:46:30.249 --> 00:46:32.584
running the actual real business.
like always.

732
00:46:40.133 --> 00:46:41.468
I take requests. you know.

733
00:46:43.887 --> 00:46:45.764
I wish we were doing this
at the new place.

734
00:46:45.764 --> 00:46:47.432
but it's still under construction.

735
00:46:47.432 --> 00:46:49.893
It's bigger than this place.
Gorgeous light.

736
00:46:49.893 --> 00:46:51.144
This is perfect.

737
00:46:52.271 --> 00:46:53.564
- So. when's the wedding?
- Very soon.

738
00:46:53.564 --> 00:46:55.315
- We're not sure.
- Soon though. Right?

739
00:46:55.315 --> 00:46:57.526
- But we just-- we don't know exactly when...
- Yeah. soon.

740
00:46:57.526 --> 00:46:59.152
- ...but soon.
- Very soon.

741
00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:00.821
Things have just gotten busy.

742
00:47:00.821 --> 00:47:03.240
Well. these little critters
surely have taken off.

743
00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:04.950
It must be so exciting for your family.

744
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:08.370
Very. Yeah.
Well. we love doing it all together.

745
00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:09.830
- Don't we. girls?
- Yeah.

746
00:47:10.330 --> 00:47:12.374
Take one of me and Ava's ghost!

747
00:47:12.374 --> 00:47:15.294
Yes. ma'am. Look at that.

748
00:47:16.044 --> 00:47:18.255
- Can I get one of the entire family?
- Sure.

749
00:47:18.255 --> 00:47:20.174
- Okey dokey.
- Yeah.

750
00:47:20.174 --> 00:47:21.341
Come on up.

751
00:47:22.718 --> 00:47:23.886
Thank you.

752
00:47:23.886 --> 00:47:26.054
All right. Look at this.

753
00:47:27.556 --> 00:47:29.850
{\an8}The girls are thrilled by the photo.

754
00:47:30.851 --> 00:47:33.687
Isn't it nice. what they said
about it being a family business?

755
00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:37.941
Yeah.
I mean. it's just a dumb magazine piece.

756
00:47:37.941 --> 00:47:39.109
But great. yeah.

757
00:47:41.153 --> 00:47:42.154
Yeah. but--

758
00:47:44.239 --> 00:47:46.909
You know.
it's gonna be really wonderful to get away

759
00:47:46.909 --> 00:47:49.453
and have some time to finally relax.
You know?

760
00:47:50.162 --> 00:47:53.665
I think when we get back.
I'm gonna get another face-lift.

761
00:47:56.043 --> 00:47:57.377
What? Why?

762
00:47:57.377 --> 00:48:01.840
Just to tighten things up.
We can get a family discount.

763
00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:05.427
You could get some work done
on your nose or something.

764
00:48:06.178 --> 00:48:08.430
- What's wrong with my nose?
- Nothing.

765
00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:11.183
It's just. you have this--
a little bump on it.

766
00:48:11.183 --> 00:48:12.476
Maren has one too.

767
00:48:12.476 --> 00:48:15.354
Maren is not getting a nose job.

768
00:48:15.354 --> 00:48:18.982
Of course not. She's a child.

769
00:48:20.067 --> 00:48:21.652
I mean-- But you're old enough.

770
00:48:24.279 --> 00:48:25.447
Are you serious with this?

771
00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:34.206
Sweetie.
Sweetie. you're beautiful. You are.

772
00:48:34.206 --> 00:48:35.832
It was just a thought.

773
00:48:35.832 --> 00:48:38.669
I like having the power
to be able to shape myself.

774
00:48:38.669 --> 00:48:40.420
and I thought you would too.

775
00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:42.339
We have a big year coming up.

776
00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:44.424
and as the saying goes.

777
00:48:44.424 --> 00:48:49.680
"Genius is 1% inspiration.
99% presentation."

778
00:48:50.305 --> 00:48:52.432
That's not how the saying goes.

779
00:48:53.517 --> 00:48:55.853
Okay. I-- Yeah. all-- Forget I brought--

780
00:48:56.395 --> 00:49:00.274
Forget I brought it up. It's just-- Yeah.

781
00:49:04.987 --> 00:49:07.281
Mom. I can't find my floaties!

782
00:49:09.533 --> 00:49:10.993
Yeah. I'm coming.

783
00:49:14.705 --> 00:49:16.373
<i>Are they honeymooning in Florida?</i>

784
00:49:16.373 --> 00:49:19.918
Just holiday vacationing.
He says he'll be tuning in tonight.

785
00:49:21.044 --> 00:49:25.799
T-minus eight hours till showtime.
Move her this way.

786
00:49:26.383 --> 00:49:27.593
Make her dance a little.

787
00:49:28.427 --> 00:49:30.929
Will a 40-minute Shockwave movie
even play online?

788
00:49:31.513 --> 00:49:33.390
'Cause I've only ever seen 30-second ones.

789
00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:34.850
Welcome to the future.

790
00:49:45.694 --> 00:49:47.863
<i>You've reached Maya.
Tell me something good.</i>

791
00:49:50.157 --> 00:49:53.952
<i>How about you tell us when
you decided not to go to medical school?</i>

792
00:49:53.952 --> 00:49:56.955
<i>Your life is your life.
but we could at least be informed</i>

793
00:49:56.955 --> 00:50:00.792
<i>all that money we carefully saved
for your education is ours again.</i>

794
00:50:00.792 --> 00:50:02.252
<i>to do what we want with.</i>

795
00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:05.047
<i>Maybe we'll do something risky
and impulsive.</i>

796
00:50:05.047 --> 00:50:07.591
<i>See? See what you're doing to us?
Okay. Think about it.</i>

797
00:50:08.842 --> 00:50:11.011
Hey! Hey! No. no. no. no!

798
00:50:11.011 --> 00:50:15.140
It's almost midnight.
and my Beanies movie's about to go live.

799
00:50:15.974 --> 00:50:17.726
Hey. do one of the raps!

800
00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:20.562
You mean the ones that boosted sales 40%?

801
00:50:20.562 --> 00:50:22.523
Yeah. Maybe later. maybe--

802
00:50:22.523 --> 00:50:24.274
Okay. here we go.

803
00:50:24.274 --> 00:50:29.488
Ten. nine. eight. seven. six. five. four.

804
00:50:29.488 --> 00:50:31.532
three. two. one.

805
00:50:36.286 --> 00:50:38.539
- Beanie Babies!
- What?

806
00:50:38.539 --> 00:50:41.542
Beanie Babies! Beanie Babies!

807
00:50:41.542 --> 00:50:43.961
It won't download. I keep trying.

808
00:50:43.961 --> 00:50:46.547
Too many people are
logging on to the site at once.

809
00:50:46.547 --> 00:50:48.048
So. no one can see anything?

810
00:50:48.632 --> 00:50:51.844
Oh. shit. I'm gonna get fired.

811
00:50:52.803 --> 00:50:54.680
We broke the entire Internet thing!

812
00:50:56.348 --> 00:50:57.641
Not exactly.

813
00:50:57.641 --> 00:51:00.102
It was our personal server lines
that got overwhelmed.

814
00:51:00.102 --> 00:51:02.521
By 18 million Beanie Baby lovers. Unbelievable.

815
00:51:02.521 --> 00:51:05.274
Again. that's not the amount
of people on our site. but--

816
00:51:05.274 --> 00:51:06.859
Amazing. It's just fantastic.

817
00:51:06.859 --> 00:51:08.777
Did I get any press calls about it?

818
00:51:08.777 --> 00:51:10.195
- Who are you?
- Hi.

819
00:51:10.195 --> 00:51:13.323
This is Linda Wallace. one of
the original Beanie Baby collectors.

820
00:51:13.323 --> 00:51:15.242
- Oh. God.
- It is such an honor to--

821
00:51:17.035 --> 00:51:18.203
Just one sec.

822
00:51:18.787 --> 00:51:21.915
Remember I told you about the cul-de-sac
that started the local craze?

823
00:51:21.915 --> 00:51:24.418
Well. Linda was ground zero.

824
00:51:24.418 --> 00:51:25.502
Guilty.

825
00:51:26.295 --> 00:51:29.965
Linda does the <i>Beanie Baby Collectors</i>
radio update on WGN now.

826
00:51:30.591 --> 00:51:31.592
You agreed to meet?

827
00:51:32.092 --> 00:51:34.761
And it-- I am just beyond excited
to meet you.

828
00:51:34.761 --> 00:51:37.556
Ty Warner. in person. Wow.

829
00:51:37.556 --> 00:51:39.308
You do a radio show about my products?

830
00:51:39.308 --> 00:51:42.811
{\an8}Plus. I actually publish
the <i>Beanie Baby Price Guide</i>.

831
00:51:42.811 --> 00:51:46.190
{\an8}which people call the bible
of the collectors' market.

832
00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:48.400
{\an8}I was hoping you'd sign it.

833
00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:51.904
And who gave you permission to do that?
Just out of curiosity.

834
00:51:53.113 --> 00:51:54.364
I didn't know I needed to get--

835
00:51:54.364 --> 00:51:56.950
Well. the guide drives tons
of customers to our site.

836
00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:58.619
{\an8}I mean. nothing hooks new collectors

837
00:51:58.619 --> 00:52:01.455
{\an8}like hearing Linda made $300.000
on Beanies.

838
00:52:02.456 --> 00:52:03.457
300.000?

839
00:52:03.457 --> 00:52:04.917
In just three months.

840
00:52:05.417 --> 00:52:06.585
How exactly?

841
00:52:06.585 --> 00:52:10.589
Well. there I was. just snapping up
as many as I could here in the States.

842
00:52:10.589 --> 00:52:13.008
but then my sister went to Liverpool.

843
00:52:13.008 --> 00:52:14.718
which-- She's a real Beatle maniac--

844
00:52:14.718 --> 00:52:18.180
And she saw piles of Iggy the Iguana
and Whisper the Deer.

845
00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:20.015
which I have been looking everywhere for.

846
00:52:20.015 --> 00:52:22.851
So. I tracked down the number
of your UK distributor.

847
00:52:22.851 --> 00:52:25.187
ordered 200 pieces direct.
plus shipping fees.

848
00:52:25.187 --> 00:52:27.773
Whole thing cost me $2.000
and very nearly my marriage.

849
00:52:27.773 --> 00:52:30.526
but 90 days later.
those babies bought us a BMW

850
00:52:30.526 --> 00:52:32.319
and a time-share in Florida.

851
00:52:32.319 --> 00:52:35.364
So now people listen
when I tell them Beanies

852
00:52:35.364 --> 00:52:37.199
are the best investment around.

853
00:52:38.242 --> 00:52:42.037
Plus. they're cute as all get-out.
You know that.

854
00:52:42.037 --> 00:52:44.414
Oh. gosh. you just gotta come on my show.

855
00:52:45.832 --> 00:52:48.585
<i>Ty filed a lawsuit by the end
of the following day.</i>

856
00:52:48.585 --> 00:52:51.129
<i>And he forced eBay
to change its "Beanie Babies" category</i>

857
00:52:51.129 --> 00:52:52.965
{\an8}<i>to "Beanbag Plush."</i>

858
00:52:53.465 --> 00:52:56.426
<i>But by then. the craze was uncontrollable.</i>

859
00:52:57.970 --> 00:53:01.056
<i>Beanie Babies
are selling hotter than tamales.</i>

860
00:53:01.056 --> 00:53:04.560
{\an8}<i>The beanbag has
been transformed into a commercial rage.</i>

861
00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:05.936
{\an8}<i>To protect themselves.</i>

862
00:53:05.936 --> 00:53:10.107
{\an8}<i>delivery workers have been painting
over Ty's logos on the boxes they deliver.</i>

863
00:53:12.568 --> 00:53:14.945
<i>People were buying
and selling half a million dollars</i>

864
00:53:14.945 --> 00:53:19.324
<i>of Beanie Babies on eBay every month.
which was bonkers.</i>

865
00:53:19.324 --> 00:53:20.826
<i>But what they couldn't see</i>

866
00:53:20.826 --> 00:53:24.329
<i>was that everybody who wanted a piece
of that was buying new.</i>

867
00:53:24.329 --> 00:53:26.623
<i>off the shelf from us.</i>

868
00:53:26.623 --> 00:53:29.501
{\an8}<i>So when eBay did half a million dollars.</i>

869
00:53:29.501 --> 00:53:32.796
<i>we did 400 times that in retail.</i>

870
00:53:33.297 --> 00:53:37.634
<i>$200 million every month.</i>

871
00:53:38.677 --> 00:53:41.013
<i>It was so much money.</i>

872
00:53:45.142 --> 00:53:47.895
<i>And we were constantly
expanding just to keep up.</i>

873
00:53:52.399 --> 00:53:54.693
<i>Everything just got
a little bit out of control.</i>

874
00:53:57.738 --> 00:53:58.739
<i>Ty included.</i>

875
00:54:00.032 --> 00:54:03.285
Maya. Did you see the latest numbers?

876
00:54:03.285 --> 00:54:04.578
People keep wanting more.

877
00:54:05.454 --> 00:54:06.955
Mr. Warner. a word?

878
00:54:06.955 --> 00:54:08.290
No. thanks. Who's this?

879
00:54:08.290 --> 00:54:10.292
Rep from Toys "R" Us or Walmart.

880
00:54:10.292 --> 00:54:13.253
- Well. get rid of him.
- We tried. They keep coming back.

881
00:54:13.795 --> 00:54:16.632
Hey! We only sell to mom-and-pops.

882
00:54:16.632 --> 00:54:18.717
No big-box stores. is that understood?

883
00:54:18.717 --> 00:54:22.387
And why don't we sell to big-box stores?
Anyone?

884
00:54:22.930 --> 00:54:24.139
Okay. Maya. go ahead.

885
00:54:24.139 --> 00:54:27.893
Their cheap product displays
invite price wars and comparison shopping.

886
00:54:27.893 --> 00:54:29.811
The America--
The-- More the America stuff.

887
00:54:29.811 --> 00:54:30.938
Right.

888
00:54:30.938 --> 00:54:34.566
Big-box stores kill small businesses
and trash the dreams of the little guy.

889
00:54:34.566 --> 00:54:37.402
And America is all about the little guy.

890
00:54:37.402 --> 00:54:40.989
And we are all about the little guy.

891
00:54:40.989 --> 00:54:42.991
Marcus. is that shipment
from China on time?

892
00:54:42.991 --> 00:54:45.577
Yes. They wanna know how many
new models we're introducing next month?

893
00:54:45.577 --> 00:54:46.954
Well. everybody wants to know that.

894
00:54:46.954 --> 00:54:49.373
Also. they asked about
an Asian distribution deal like the UK.

895
00:54:49.373 --> 00:54:53.961
No. listen! No UK! No UK!

896
00:54:53.961 --> 00:54:57.673
Hey. did you see those tweaks
that I made to the platypus design?

897
00:54:57.673 --> 00:54:59.508
I did. They were very good.

898
00:54:59.508 --> 00:55:00.801
- Yeah. I knew you'd like them.
- Yeah.

899
00:55:00.801 --> 00:55:03.846
I'm sorry to interrupt. but <i>Parade</i> needs
an answer about the profile.

900
00:55:03.846 --> 00:55:07.057
They'd like to interview Ava too
about the popularity of Spooky.

901
00:55:07.057 --> 00:55:09.226
The audience reach could be huge.

902
00:55:09.226 --> 00:55:11.436
First of all. Spooky is not that popular.

903
00:55:11.436 --> 00:55:13.814
And also. no more dinky press. okay?

904
00:55:13.814 --> 00:55:15.607
<i>Parade</i> has over 20 million subscribers.

905
00:55:15.607 --> 00:55:20.362
I only want to speak to Oprah Winfrey.
Has she reached out?

906
00:55:20.362 --> 00:55:22.114
- Not yet.
- Thank you.

907
00:55:22.114 --> 00:55:24.491
Steven Spielberg's office called again
and now they're offering

908
00:55:24.491 --> 00:55:27.536
- triple what they were offering before.
- Not interested again. I'm not a sellout.

909
00:55:27.536 --> 00:55:29.663
Is that selling out to Mattel
and the Barbie tie-in then?

910
00:55:29.663 --> 00:55:32.666
I am sorry for that. I will pass.
and I'll pass on McDonald's as well.

911
00:55:32.666 --> 00:55:34.918
Why would you do that? I love McDonald's.

912
00:55:34.918 --> 00:55:36.587
- You do?
- Yes. Of course.

913
00:55:37.462 --> 00:55:40.382
Of course I love McD-- Everybody loves--
The president loves McDonald's.

914
00:55:40.382 --> 00:55:42.259
- You love McDonald's. right?
- Fiercely.

915
00:55:42.259 --> 00:55:44.845
Don't you think partnering with them
might be too big a strain

916
00:55:44.845 --> 00:55:47.347
- on our distribution system?
- Oh. my God.

917
00:55:47.347 --> 00:55:49.641
Can you imagine the markets
that's gonna open up?

918
00:55:49.641 --> 00:55:52.102
Sure. but we can barely keep up
with the mom-and-pops already.

919
00:55:52.102 --> 00:55:53.854
It would be like a Super Bowl ad
for a bake sale.

920
00:55:53.854 --> 00:55:57.399
- You heard her. We love McDonald's.
- Great. I will follow up.

921
00:55:57.399 --> 00:56:00.652
- Mickey D's!
- Ty. I mean. it's thrilling

922
00:56:00.652 --> 00:56:02.154
the demand for Beanies is so nuts.

923
00:56:02.154 --> 00:56:05.240
but we gotta be able to handle it.
Remember New Year's?

924
00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:09.161
Listen. we can put even tinier
Beanie Babies inside of Happy Meals.

925
00:56:09.161 --> 00:56:13.832
Little tiny guys. It'd be so cute.
And adorable.

926
00:56:13.832 --> 00:56:17.211
Profitable. Go with me to the airport.
I wanna go over designs.

927
00:56:19.546 --> 00:56:22.341
<i>It's hard to know how
to reason with delusion.</i>

928
00:56:23.717 --> 00:56:26.386
<i>And sometimes you just
go along to get along.</i>

929
00:56:26.386 --> 00:56:29.014
<i>By late '92. Clinton was president.</i>

930
00:56:29.515 --> 00:56:32.476
<i>and I was in London
nailing down foreign expansion.</i>

931
00:56:33.936 --> 00:56:35.521
<i>It's only 3:00 my time.</i>

932
00:56:35.521 --> 00:56:38.190
I could stay here all night.
but I don't want to keep you.

933
00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:41.193
Were you able
to look at the proposal I faxed?

934
00:56:41.193 --> 00:56:44.279
- Yes. and it's quite tempting.
- Good. Good.

935
00:56:44.279 --> 00:56:46.281
But I'm afraid there's a bit of a snag.

936
00:56:47.157 --> 00:56:50.118
Surely there's nothing we can't work out.

937
00:56:52.996 --> 00:56:55.249
Legal says we can't make a deal with you

938
00:56:55.249 --> 00:56:58.001
since you're not technically
the owner of Ty Inc.

939
00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:04.132
My partner and I run the company together.

940
00:57:04.883 --> 00:57:05.926
I do the deals.

941
00:57:05.926 --> 00:57:08.303
he signs off once I walk him
through the numbers.

942
00:57:08.303 --> 00:57:10.848
It's-- We've been working
like this for years.

943
00:57:10.848 --> 00:57:13.559
I'm sure it's just a miscommunication.

944
00:57:15.102 --> 00:57:16.854
But we've been told differently.

945
00:57:22.693 --> 00:57:24.152
I thought you knew.

946
00:57:24.152 --> 00:57:26.154
He said your priorities had changed

947
00:57:26.154 --> 00:57:29.366
and he was restructuring the company
based on both your wishes.

948
00:57:30.117 --> 00:57:32.369
I got the sense you were trying
to have a child.

949
00:57:32.369 --> 00:57:35.831
No. No. no. no. No.

950
00:57:36.373 --> 00:57:39.501
You need to restore
the previous agreement immediately.

951
00:57:40.169 --> 00:57:42.629
I'm sorry. Robbie. but my hands are tied.

952
00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:47.593
That looks great. Ty.

953
00:57:48.719 --> 00:57:49.803
I'll tell you when I'm ready.

954
00:57:49.803 --> 00:57:51.597
I'm just working on my smile. Okay.

955
00:57:51.597 --> 00:57:53.807
Just let me get my smile.
then I'll go like this.

956
00:57:53.807 --> 00:57:55.142
and then you snap your picture.

957
00:57:55.142 --> 00:57:57.269
Sure. Okay. you let me know when.

958
00:57:59.771 --> 00:58:01.648
- Go.
- No. I-- Okay.

959
00:58:02.232 --> 00:58:03.233
No. I think we got it.

960
00:58:03.233 --> 00:58:05.569
- I'm gonna fucking kill you.
- Hey. Robbie. just--

961
00:58:05.569 --> 00:58:07.196
- Take five.
- Yeah.

962
00:58:08.155 --> 00:58:10.157
Okay. hon. what seems to be the--
Welcome back.

963
00:58:10.157 --> 00:58:12.659
Fuck you.
You know exactly what the problem is.

964
00:58:13.452 --> 00:58:17.831
Your little restructuring stunt
is a sick joke.

965
00:58:17.831 --> 00:58:21.668
Robbie.
This has always been Ty Inc.. right?

966
00:58:22.794 --> 00:58:26.548
I mean. you've been an incredible helper.
but this has always been my company.

967
00:58:28.926 --> 00:58:30.761
Are you fucking kidding?

968
00:58:30.761 --> 00:58:34.056
Roberta.
you know I don't like that rough language.

969
00:58:34.723 --> 00:58:36.391
You know what I don't like?

970
00:58:36.391 --> 00:58:42.022
Getting fucked out of a company I created.
that we created together.

971
00:58:42.022 --> 00:58:44.483
That's not happening.
Why do you have to be so dramatic?

972
00:58:44.483 --> 00:58:48.487
I am no longer cofounder.
and my salary has been reduced 75%.

973
00:58:49.571 --> 00:58:51.532
Okay.
Can you keep your voice down a little bit?

974
00:58:51.532 --> 00:58:53.992
Don't fucking tell me
to keep my voice down!

975
00:58:55.953 --> 00:58:57.746
That wasn't salary. That was commissions.

976
00:58:57.746 --> 00:59:01.708
And commissions don't make sense at the
level we're working at now. They don't.

977
00:59:01.708 --> 00:59:03.293
Do you even know
what you're talking about?

978
00:59:03.293 --> 00:59:05.337
Yeah. I'm just doing what's necessary.

979
00:59:05.921 --> 00:59:09.299
You know. running the real
actual business over here.

980
00:59:16.139 --> 00:59:19.852
And as far as expanding into the UK.
now's not the time.

981
00:59:19.852 --> 00:59:23.564
But when it is.
I have our perfect partners lined up.

982
00:59:25.065 --> 00:59:27.526
Actually came up with the idea
in the shower. believe it or not.

983
00:59:28.318 --> 00:59:29.653
Jehovah's Witnesses.

984
00:59:31.989 --> 00:59:34.366
The greatest one-on-one salesmen
in the world. How brilliant is that?

985
00:59:38.245 --> 00:59:40.998
Robbie.
I-- Honestly. what is the big deal?

986
00:59:40.998 --> 00:59:43.458
I mean. we're still together.

987
00:59:43.458 --> 00:59:46.837
We're not breaking up.
We're still partners in everything.

988
00:59:46.837 --> 00:59:49.089
I mean. what is mine is yours.

989
00:59:50.007 --> 00:59:52.467
You have the golden ticket. You have me.

990
00:59:56.805 --> 00:59:58.056
What a prize.

991
01:00:01.935 --> 01:00:04.146
It's pointless to talk to you
when you're like this.

992
01:00:04.146 --> 01:00:06.273
- I mean--
- When I stand up for myself. you mean.

993
01:00:06.273 --> 01:00:08.066
Yeah. what a bummer for you.

994
01:00:08.859 --> 01:00:12.946
You should call one of your easier women.
Lorraine from the coffee shop.

995
01:00:13.488 --> 01:00:15.616
- Julie from the dry cleaner.
- Okay.

996
01:00:16.158 --> 01:00:18.368
Any one of the dozens
from the trade circuit.

997
01:00:18.368 --> 01:00:20.037
I know about them all. Ty.

998
01:00:20.037 --> 01:00:24.833
- Okay. We mutually agreed to occasion--
- Go fuck yourself.

999
01:00:24.833 --> 01:00:29.004
You're a child. A selfish child.

1000
01:00:30.339 --> 01:00:34.593
And I cannot believe
how long I've put up with it.

1001
01:00:37.179 --> 01:00:38.555
Hey. listen to me.

1002
01:00:39.181 --> 01:00:42.226
If it wasn't for me. you'd still be
wasting away at the Speedi-Shop.

1003
01:00:42.726 --> 01:00:46.104
Where's the gratitude?
I've given you an amazing life.

1004
01:00:47.481 --> 01:00:48.690
I made you.

1005
01:00:53.529 --> 01:00:56.365
Mrs. Warner. We're waiting.

1006
01:00:56.365 --> 01:00:59.201
You guys. this is definitely the one.

1007
01:01:02.704 --> 01:01:04.748
- No. you don't like it? What?
- We love it.

1008
01:01:04.748 --> 01:01:05.999
Never take it off.

1009
01:01:07.459 --> 01:01:11.463
Have I told you how excited we are
that this wedding is finally happening?

1010
01:01:12.464 --> 01:01:13.465
Thank you.

1011
01:01:13.465 --> 01:01:15.634
So have you guys picked a honeymoon?

1012
01:01:15.634 --> 01:01:18.637
Yeah. Fiji. All of us. we're all going.
"Familymoon."

1013
01:01:18.637 --> 01:01:22.975
A familymoon in Fiji. all right.
Better live this dream.

1014
01:01:25.769 --> 01:01:29.439
- Hello? Ty?
- Hi. Mom!

1015
01:01:29.982 --> 01:01:31.191
We're in here.

1016
01:01:32.484 --> 01:01:33.527
Ty ran away.

1017
01:01:35.779 --> 01:01:37.823
What? Where'd he go?

1018
01:01:37.823 --> 01:01:40.200
Out the door. I don't know.

1019
01:01:40.784 --> 01:01:42.202
Maybe the new house?

1020
01:01:42.202 --> 01:01:43.287
Oh. my God.

1021
01:01:44.079 --> 01:01:46.164
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Of course.

1022
01:01:46.164 --> 01:01:48.834
They're asleep in their room.
and I don't know how long I'll be. but--

1023
01:01:48.834 --> 01:01:50.002
Okay. don't worry. Just go.

1024
01:01:50.002 --> 01:01:51.837
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yeah. be careful.

1025
01:02:12.316 --> 01:02:13.442
Ty?

1026
01:02:20.782 --> 01:02:21.909
Sweetheart?

1027
01:02:35.047 --> 01:02:36.048
Ty?

1028
01:02:55.442 --> 01:02:56.443
Ty?

1029
01:03:05.744 --> 01:03:09.706
Sweetheart? What happened? Are you okay?

1030
01:03:09.706 --> 01:03:12.000
I can't. I just can't. I can't.

1031
01:03:12.918 --> 01:03:14.586
Can't what?

1032
01:03:15.379 --> 01:03:17.256
I can't do this.

1033
01:03:18.215 --> 01:03:20.801
Honey. what's happened? What's going on?

1034
01:03:20.801 --> 01:03:22.719
I just-- Getting married.

1035
01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:26.974
I don't know how to do family.

1036
01:03:29.977 --> 01:03:31.061
I don't know how to--

1037
01:03:31.061 --> 01:03:32.980
I don't know how to do this. I--

1038
01:03:34.022 --> 01:03:35.315
I didn't have a family.

1039
01:03:36.733 --> 01:03:38.610
No one ever--
Do you know-- No one ever even--

1040
01:03:38.610 --> 01:03:40.571
- Hey. Sweetheart.
- Do you know--

1041
01:03:40.571 --> 01:03:43.574
- No one ever--
- You're loved now.

1042
01:03:44.867 --> 01:03:47.327
The girls and I love you so much.

1043
01:03:51.999 --> 01:03:54.710
I can't be a parent.

1044
01:04:00.382 --> 01:04:02.384
I'm the child.

1045
01:04:05.179 --> 01:04:07.264
I need to be taken care of.

1046
01:04:16.481 --> 01:04:17.566
Hey.

1047
01:04:23.197 --> 01:04:25.908
It's okay. Sweetheart.

1048
01:04:27.868 --> 01:04:28.994
I need you.

1049
01:04:34.625 --> 01:04:36.627
Hold me like I'm a little boy.

1050
01:04:56.355 --> 01:04:57.648
- Hi.
- Hi. ma'am.

1051
01:04:57.648 --> 01:05:00.359
I'm gonna need access
to the garage to unload.

1052
01:05:02.444 --> 01:05:05.447
- Returned products. 48 boxes?
- Yeah sure.

1053
01:05:05.447 --> 01:05:06.532
Okay.

1054
01:05:08.742 --> 01:05:09.826
All right. Thank you.

1055
01:05:10.327 --> 01:05:12.204
- Great. I'll open up.
- All right.

1056
01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:23.090
Gorgeous light. isn't it?

1057
01:05:24.466 --> 01:05:27.928
I know you love window seats.
so I ordered a whole wall of them.

1058
01:05:33.141 --> 01:05:34.685
We need to talk.

1059
01:05:38.021 --> 01:05:40.148
Listen. the freak-out last night.

1060
01:05:42.985 --> 01:05:43.986
It's over.

1061
01:05:43.986 --> 01:05:46.196
I feel much better now. I do.

1062
01:05:46.196 --> 01:05:49.908
Good. Well. I wish I did.

1063
01:05:52.035 --> 01:05:53.537
You don't wanna sit down?

1064
01:06:02.087 --> 01:06:06.884
I'm in love with you. Ty.
But I didn't wanna be.

1065
01:06:08.010 --> 01:06:11.722
I was gonna stay single
for Maren and Ava. remember?

1066
01:06:12.848 --> 01:06:14.975
Spare them a man abandoning them.

1067
01:06:16.268 --> 01:06:22.399
But you convinced me you were different. devoted.

1068
01:06:23.358 --> 01:06:25.110
And then you pull this?

1069
01:06:27.654 --> 01:06:28.697
No.

1070
01:06:34.244 --> 01:06:36.663
No. you gotta
find someone else to be your mom.

1071
01:06:36.663 --> 01:06:38.248
- I'm booked already.
- Wait.

1072
01:06:38.248 --> 01:06:39.333
What are you saying?

1073
01:06:41.376 --> 01:06:47.007
I'm saying. I let you in to be a partner.
to really build something good together.

1074
01:06:47.007 --> 01:06:48.884
And if you can do that. wonderful.

1075
01:06:49.885 --> 01:06:52.346
But I'm not gonna stick around
if you plan to fuck it up.

1076
01:07:02.689 --> 01:07:06.109
I'm sorry. You're right.

1077
01:07:09.279 --> 01:07:11.698
You're right. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1078
01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:17.329
I will never let you down again. I swear.

1079
01:07:18.205 --> 01:07:22.543
Please don't leave. Please.

1080
01:07:23.043 --> 01:07:26.880
Everything good that's happened to me
is because of you guys. Did you know that?

1081
01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:32.469
We are bonded forever.
There's no one I'd rather be with.

1082
01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:36.014
Do you understand that?

1083
01:07:39.309 --> 01:07:40.310
You're my home.

1084
01:07:41.687 --> 01:07:43.272
You're my rock.

1085
01:07:44.857 --> 01:07:46.149
You're my life.

1086
01:07:58.412 --> 01:08:00.622
<i>Break out those raincoats
and umbrellas. folks.</i>

1087
01:08:00.622 --> 01:08:02.040
<i>We got a few days of rain...</i>

1088
01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:04.668
- Do you know what you want?
- Nuggets. Always.

1089
01:08:04.668 --> 01:08:06.712
Same. Sweet and sour or honey?

1090
01:08:07.588 --> 01:08:10.215
Barbecue. What's wrong with you?

1091
01:08:10.215 --> 01:08:13.635
<i>Riots broke out at McDonald's
restaurants across the nation today</i>

1092
01:08:13.635 --> 01:08:16.220
<i>as the company
launched their Teenie Beanie promotion.</i>

1093
01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:17.139
Yeah.

1094
01:08:17.139 --> 01:08:19.474
<i>The first batch of Beanies was meant
to last two weeks. but ran out...</i>

1095
01:08:19.474 --> 01:08:22.394
Can you believe something we work on
is that popular?

1096
01:08:22.394 --> 01:08:23.729
Yes.

1097
01:08:36.867 --> 01:08:38.911
What is happening?

1098
01:08:38.911 --> 01:08:42.288
<i>At one McDonald's.
a delivery man arriving with a case</i>

1099
01:08:42.288 --> 01:08:45.000
of the Teenie Beanies was tackled

1100
01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.710
by overzealous customers.

1101
01:08:46.710 --> 01:08:50.546
Thanks to this little guy.
the Cubs sold out Wrigley Field today

1102
01:08:50.546 --> 01:08:52.424
for the first time in decades.

1103
01:08:52.424 --> 01:08:54.885
{\an8}Two divorcées unable to reach an agreement

1104
01:08:54.885 --> 01:08:58.095
{\an8}about how to split their
prized Beanie Baby collection

1105
01:08:58.095 --> 01:09:01.183
{\an8}were ordered to make their picks
under judicial supervision.

1106
01:09:01.183 --> 01:09:03.185
US Trade Rep Charlene Barshefsky

1107
01:09:03.185 --> 01:09:06.188
has turned over
the 40 Beanie Babies she procured

1108
01:09:06.188 --> 01:09:08.732
in Beijing during her trip
with President Clinton.

1109
01:09:08.732 --> 01:09:10.234
in violation of trade law.

1110
01:09:10.234 --> 01:09:12.528
Traffic on I-95 shut down for hours

1111
01:09:12.528 --> 01:09:15.656
{\an8}after a crashed semi
carrying Beanie Babies

1112
01:09:15.656 --> 01:09:18.075
{\an8}<i>sparked a frenzy you have
to see to believe.</i>

1113
01:09:23.997 --> 01:09:24.831
Looking good.

1114
01:09:26.457 --> 01:09:27.835
Did you see the latest numbers?

1115
01:09:27.835 --> 01:09:30.379
Billion dollar profit year. Congrats.

1116
01:09:31.004 --> 01:09:34.424
I'm gonna make over $700 million. Just me.

1117
01:09:35.843 --> 01:09:37.553
Did you see the truck crash
with the Beanies?

1118
01:09:37.553 --> 01:09:38.886
Insane.

1119
01:09:39.388 --> 01:09:41.180
Poor Beanies. But--

1120
01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:44.350
I mean. managing the craze has
become a whole separate job.

1121
01:09:44.852 --> 01:09:48.354
Which is why I wanted
to talk to you. if you've got a sec.

1122
01:09:48.939 --> 01:09:49.773
I'm all ears.

1123
01:09:49.773 --> 01:09:52.526
I think it's time for you
to consider a company restructure.

1124
01:09:53.359 --> 01:09:54.945
And what do you mean by that?

1125
01:09:54.945 --> 01:09:58.657
Well. everyone knows you're
a superstar design and marketing genius.

1126
01:09:58.657 --> 01:09:59.825
like no one else alive.

1127
01:09:59.825 --> 01:10:02.411
I mean. it just--
it seems silly to distract you

1128
01:10:02.411 --> 01:10:05.747
from your natural talents
with mundane business chores.

1129
01:10:06.331 --> 01:10:07.749
I know Robbie used to handle all those.

1130
01:10:07.749 --> 01:10:10.419
I don't wanna hear that name. Thank you.

1131
01:10:10.961 --> 01:10:15.716
But this company has transformed into
a mega success since then. Thanks to you.

1132
01:10:16.383 --> 01:10:18.177
You just need
to keep channeling your brilliance

1133
01:10:18.177 --> 01:10:20.345
where it's most fun and fulfilling.

1134
01:10:20.345 --> 01:10:26.226
While you. you know. tap someone you trust
to handle pesky. day-to-day headaches.

1135
01:10:26.935 --> 01:10:30.480
Chief operating officer.
A consigliere. A right hand.

1136
01:10:31.982 --> 01:10:33.817
Someone to deal with all the boring stuff.

1137
01:10:33.817 --> 01:10:37.154
freeing you up to continue doing the real.
important work.

1138
01:10:44.203 --> 01:10:45.204
I like it.

1139
01:10:45.704 --> 01:10:50.709
Yep. There we go.
You're the best. Keep it up.

1140
01:10:50.709 --> 01:10:52.586
<i>I liked the bullshit and the boring stuff.</i>

1141
01:10:52.586 --> 01:10:53.879
What's next?

1142
01:10:53.879 --> 01:10:55.964
-<i>Solving puzzles. connecting dots...</i>
- Hi.

1143
01:10:55.964 --> 01:10:58.634
-<i>...streamlining the system. Making it grow.</i>
- I actually have this for you.

1144
01:10:58.634 --> 01:10:59.676
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

1145
01:10:59.676 --> 01:11:02.262
<i>Thank God for the great equalizer
of the Internet.</i>

1146
01:11:02.846 --> 01:11:05.140
<i>saving me from ten years
of higher education.</i>

1147
01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:06.391
<i>setting me up to take charge of--</i>

1148
01:11:06.391 --> 01:11:10.145
- Everybody. listen up! Meet Blaine.
- Hi. team.

1149
01:11:10.145 --> 01:11:13.857
Ty has brought me
on to put the fun in restructure

1150
01:11:13.857 --> 01:11:15.943
and take this company to the next level.

1151
01:11:15.943 --> 01:11:20.656
So. who's with me?
Who is ready to go big or go home?

1152
01:11:20.656 --> 01:11:22.824
Come on. Let me hear ya.
Let me hear you now.

1153
01:11:23.492 --> 01:11:24.535
There you go.

1154
01:11:25.244 --> 01:11:26.828
What a bastard.

1155
01:11:27.955 --> 01:11:29.998
Well. if it's any consolation.

1156
01:11:29.998 --> 01:11:32.459
everyone knows you're the one
really running the show.

1157
01:11:35.295 --> 01:11:36.380
It isn't.

1158
01:11:38.715 --> 01:11:41.009
I created and built this company.

1159
01:11:42.302 --> 01:11:45.722
and I have no rights. no salary claims.

1160
01:11:47.599 --> 01:11:49.142
How is that even possible?

1161
01:11:49.142 --> 01:11:52.521
'Cause the system isn't designed
for people like us.

1162
01:11:53.647 --> 01:11:54.898
Fucking hell.

1163
01:11:56.984 --> 01:11:59.653
I spent my whole fucking life
taking care of people.

1164
01:12:01.029 --> 01:12:05.200
And I thought Ty was the one person
who didn't need that.

1165
01:12:10.455 --> 01:12:13.417
What the fuck is that? Come here.

1166
01:12:17.588 --> 01:12:18.589
Oh. boy.

1167
01:12:21.341 --> 01:12:23.385
That ass-face is spying on me?

1168
01:12:23.385 --> 01:12:27.097
- All of us probably.
- That fucked-up motherfucker.

1169
01:12:27.681 --> 01:12:30.309
He's heard a lot of stuff
I really wish he hadn't.

1170
01:12:30.309 --> 01:12:32.686
There's gotta be a way
we can use this against him.

1171
01:12:37.357 --> 01:12:39.568
Uh-huh. See you then.

1172
01:12:41.653 --> 01:12:43.906
Hey. Showtime.

1173
01:12:45.699 --> 01:12:47.242
So. I just didn't see the brilliance

1174
01:12:47.242 --> 01:12:50.871
of the whole UK. Jehovah's Witness idea.
because I was so mad.

1175
01:12:50.871 --> 01:12:52.873
Sure. that temper of yours.

1176
01:12:52.873 --> 01:12:58.253
But it is pure genius.
I just-- Not that I would tell him that.

1177
01:12:58.253 --> 01:13:01.882
Of course not. But Jehovah's Witnesses.
who'd have thunk?

1178
01:13:01.882 --> 01:13:04.009
It takes a brain like Ty's.

1179
01:13:04.009 --> 01:13:08.096
That total virtuoso.
off-the-charts mastermind.

1180
01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:11.433
So. you guys good again?

1181
01:13:13.727 --> 01:13:17.147
Getting there. He'll probably buy me

1182
01:13:17.648 --> 01:13:21.401
some amazing gift.
and then I'll be putty in his hands again.

1183
01:13:21.401 --> 01:13:24.112
Haven't you been wanting to learn guitar?

1184
01:13:24.112 --> 01:13:26.031
- I don't know.
- No.

1185
01:13:30.327 --> 01:13:33.497
-<i>Beta</i>. tell us what's wrong.
- Everything.

1186
01:13:37.125 --> 01:13:38.877
Thought I had it all figured out.

1187
01:13:38.877 --> 01:13:41.588
But my boss hired some slick
idiot consultant instead.

1188
01:13:41.588 --> 01:13:44.883
You've been fired? After all that you
gave up. they fired you?

1189
01:13:45.384 --> 01:13:47.845
I still have my job.
I just wanted a better one.

1190
01:13:47.845 --> 01:13:51.431
Okay. you're 22.
These things. they take time.

1191
01:13:51.431 --> 01:13:53.392
I've been there five years.

1192
01:13:53.934 --> 01:13:57.271
I understand the company better
than anyone. and I see where it's going.

1193
01:13:57.271 --> 01:13:58.647
Which is where. exactly?

1194
01:13:59.606 --> 01:14:02.734
Well. soon we'll finally be able to keep
up with the demand for Beanie Babies.

1195
01:14:02.734 --> 01:14:04.027
Which will actually be a problem.

1196
01:14:04.027 --> 01:14:06.864
because a lot of their appeal
has been how hard they are to get.

1197
01:14:08.156 --> 01:14:09.533
So. you're saying this will be trouble?

1198
01:14:09.533 --> 01:14:11.994
Yeah. if we don't get ahead of it.
yeah. definitely.

1199
01:14:11.994 --> 01:14:13.412
How much time do we have?

1200
01:14:13.912 --> 01:14:17.165
I mean. it's not like there are
precise metrics for measuring. like...

1201
01:14:23.463 --> 01:14:24.464
Wait.

1202
01:14:27.009 --> 01:14:30.679
You'll be sick of me. I'll be
in Tokyo so much. as much as needed.

1203
01:14:30.679 --> 01:14:32.514
The Asian launch is my top focus.

1204
01:14:34.391 --> 01:14:35.434
Hey. team.

1205
01:14:35.934 --> 01:14:40.355
What a surprise. This is Maya Kumar.
our online girl.

1206
01:14:40.355 --> 01:14:43.609
Maya. this is Mr. Harano. Mr. Suzuki.

1207
01:14:43.609 --> 01:14:46.069
They're interested in partnering with us
for the Japan market.

1208
01:14:46.069 --> 01:14:48.113
We were just laying out a road map

1209
01:14:48.113 --> 01:14:51.700
for creating the kind of demand there
that we did here.

1210
01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:52.784
Great.

1211
01:14:52.784 --> 01:14:55.871
Then you already talked about our unique
relationship with the secondary market

1212
01:14:55.871 --> 01:14:58.957
and the crucial role it plays
in any smart strategy going forward?

1213
01:14:58.957 --> 01:15:01.627
Yes. We covered how we control
the collector craze

1214
01:15:01.627 --> 01:15:03.378
with limited runs and retirements.

1215
01:15:03.378 --> 01:15:06.340
and how that fuels demand
for the entire line.

1216
01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:08.884
And how it's the unlimited runs

1217
01:15:08.884 --> 01:15:11.762
where we and our distribution partners
make the big bucks.

1218
01:15:11.762 --> 01:15:14.723
See. the primary market.
that's where the profits are.

1219
01:15:14.723 --> 01:15:20.729
And the secondary market. while handy.
well. it's secondary.

1220
01:15:21.647 --> 01:15:23.815
- No offense. Maya.
- No. none taken.

1221
01:15:23.815 --> 01:15:26.527
Demand is what we all care about.
Demand is king.

1222
01:15:27.194 --> 01:15:30.030
It's amazing how we can now measure
and understand that demand

1223
01:15:30.030 --> 01:15:32.241
using secondary market tools to help us

1224
01:15:32.241 --> 01:15:34.618
steer our business
more skillfully than ever before.

1225
01:15:34.618 --> 01:15:38.330
Uh-huh. So. back to the rollout.
I think the smarter--

1226
01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:39.790
What are these tools?

1227
01:15:41.542 --> 01:15:46.713
Well. the most basic is using
eBay markups to measure demand.

1228
01:15:46.713 --> 01:15:51.134
So this is how much we ship. and this is
how much they're marking them up on eBay.

1229
01:15:52.177 --> 01:15:55.973
On the high end. we've seen
Peanut the Elephant go for $7.000.

1230
01:15:57.474 --> 01:16:00.727
And on the low end.
there's no markup at all.

1231
01:16:01.645 --> 01:16:04.273
The more we ship. the lower the markup.

1232
01:16:04.273 --> 01:16:08.944
But if we ever cross zero.
market collapses.

1233
01:16:08.944 --> 01:16:11.405
- Which will not happen.
- No.

1234
01:16:11.405 --> 01:16:13.532
We actively monitor that threshold.

1235
01:16:13.532 --> 01:16:16.785
and we ship
up to 33 million Beanies a month.

1236
01:16:16.785 --> 01:16:19.037
before there's any cause for concern.

1237
01:16:19.037 --> 01:16:21.790
Right. 33 million.

1238
01:16:21.790 --> 01:16:24.334
But that's just our simplest projection.

1239
01:16:24.334 --> 01:16:27.963
And it's not the full picture.
because demand isn't static.

1240
01:16:27.963 --> 01:16:30.799
We now have a gold mine of data
from the eBay market.

1241
01:16:30.799 --> 01:16:33.969
Bids on a given model.
percentage where reserve is never met.

1242
01:16:33.969 --> 01:16:37.431
Timing of response bids.
plus a half a dozen others.

1243
01:16:37.431 --> 01:16:41.393
These metrics give us incredible
new insight on where demand is headed.

1244
01:16:42.686 --> 01:16:47.649
So in three months.
it'll be in this range.

1245
01:16:47.649 --> 01:16:50.611
So number is not 33 million.

1246
01:16:51.445 --> 01:16:54.823
It could be as low as 26 million.

1247
01:16:55.407 --> 01:16:57.618
I mean. worst-case scenario.

1248
01:16:57.618 --> 01:17:00.287
And thankfully. our worst-case scenario

1249
01:17:00.287 --> 01:17:02.706
is still overwhelming global demand.

1250
01:17:02.706 --> 01:17:05.876
Provided we understand.
respect and protect it.

1251
01:17:05.876 --> 01:17:09.421
So instead of just blindly pushing
our numbers up and hoping for the best.

1252
01:17:09.421 --> 01:17:13.634
we here at Ty grow our market
strategically. confidently.

1253
01:17:13.634 --> 01:17:16.553
using tools no one's ever used before.

1254
01:17:16.553 --> 01:17:19.056
I mean. we're light-years ahead
of everyone on this stuff.

1255
01:17:19.056 --> 01:17:22.100
And that's why we're the most
successful toy company in the world.

1256
01:17:28.273 --> 01:17:31.401
Well. that was great. They were impressed.

1257
01:17:31.401 --> 01:17:33.904
Good. I'm glad. But it wasn't for them.

1258
01:17:34.738 --> 01:17:36.782
My life is this company.
You know that. right?

1259
01:17:38.450 --> 01:17:41.411
They're totally in. They just asked
for the same terms as the UK.

1260
01:17:41.411 --> 01:17:45.249
Hey. No. We don't talk about the UK! Ever.

1261
01:17:45.249 --> 01:17:48.919
Okay. Yeah. I'll-- No worries.
I'll fix it.

1262
01:17:48.919 --> 01:17:51.129
- They're gonna be incredible partners.
- Thank you.

1263
01:17:54.383 --> 01:17:57.219
Gotta be honest. Ty.
Blaine doesn't understand our company.

1264
01:17:57.719 --> 01:17:59.221
I don't think we need his advice.

1265
01:17:59.221 --> 01:18:02.432
Well. he has some things to learn.
but he has an amazing track record.

1266
01:18:02.432 --> 01:18:05.269
Maximizing profits
at soulless corporations.

1267
01:18:05.269 --> 01:18:08.897
But we're unique.
Our dysfunction is part of our heart.

1268
01:18:08.897 --> 01:18:12.067
I mean.
no one knows that better than you. And me.

1269
01:18:13.944 --> 01:18:18.323
I'm the person for this job. Ty.
You don't need outsiders.

1270
01:18:18.323 --> 01:18:20.951
I helped take Ty Inc.
from millions to billions.

1271
01:18:20.951 --> 01:18:22.202
And I've loved it.

1272
01:18:22.202 --> 01:18:25.497
Coming up with the poems.
running the website. fostering the market.

1273
01:18:25.497 --> 01:18:28.375
I mean. everything. But in all this time.

1274
01:18:28.375 --> 01:18:30.919
I've only ever had an "assistant" title
and an hourly wage.

1275
01:18:30.919 --> 01:18:32.212
You've had raises.

1276
01:18:32.713 --> 01:18:36.842
True. I started at minimum wage.
And now I make $12 an hour.

1277
01:18:39.219 --> 01:18:43.557
Well. I know a lot of people
that would like to make $12 an hour.

1278
01:18:45.142 --> 01:18:47.936
Considering all I do.
I think there's room for improvement.

1279
01:18:49.021 --> 01:18:51.690
We were the first company to have
a website for our customers.

1280
01:18:51.690 --> 01:18:55.027
Have you noticed everyone does that now?
That was my idea.

1281
01:18:55.611 --> 01:19:01.158
But using my resources. or my initiative.
I mean. I'm paying you to have ideas.

1282
01:19:01.158 --> 01:19:04.578
Well. I've netted a fortune
for this company. over and over.

1283
01:19:04.578 --> 01:19:07.289
I mean.
I understand our business inside and out.

1284
01:19:07.289 --> 01:19:10.000
and I'm telling you now.
there are signs of real trouble.

1285
01:19:10.626 --> 01:19:12.920
Have you seen that piece about this being
a bubble about to burst?

1286
01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:15.672
I don't accept babbling from outsiders.

1287
01:19:15.672 --> 01:19:18.509
Sure. but even some of our most
loyal collectors are getting frustrated.

1288
01:19:18.509 --> 01:19:22.304
Complaining about overproduction
and oversupply. pleading with us

1289
01:19:22.304 --> 01:19:24.681
to be more thoughtful
about new Beanie intros.

1290
01:19:24.681 --> 01:19:27.559
The collectors are idiots.
I hate the collectors.

1291
01:19:27.559 --> 01:19:31.855
- They're our bellwether. our engine.
- I'm the bellwether. I'm the engine.

1292
01:19:31.855 --> 01:19:33.398
Who's the billionaire here?

1293
01:19:34.399 --> 01:19:36.568
You. Of course.

1294
01:19:37.778 --> 01:19:41.240
But if there's turbulence ahead.
you need me helping navigate.

1295
01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:43.116
Not some clueless hotshot.

1296
01:19:43.116 --> 01:19:45.285
Okay.
Blaine might be great at old-school sales.

1297
01:19:45.285 --> 01:19:49.373
but our value is online now. and I run
that. I run fucking circles around that.

1298
01:19:52.584 --> 01:19:54.378
- Okay. I've heard you.
- No. Are you sure?

1299
01:19:55.504 --> 01:19:57.548
'Cause I thought I was being clear
the first time.

1300
01:19:57.548 --> 01:19:59.967
so I wanna make really sure
that I'm being clear now.

1301
01:19:59.967 --> 01:20:04.513
I'm your right hand. Ty. Me. Maya Kumar.

1302
01:20:11.395 --> 01:20:13.772
You know how much you mean to me
and this company.

1303
01:20:16.608 --> 01:20:17.609
I'll make it right.

1304
01:20:20.863 --> 01:20:22.155
- Good. Thank you.
- Okay.

1305
01:20:33.625 --> 01:20:35.252
I looked into suing him.

1306
01:20:35.252 --> 01:20:37.921
It would cost every penny I have.
and I still wouldn't win.

1307
01:20:38.839 --> 01:20:40.674
Have you considered poisoning him?

1308
01:20:42.092 --> 01:20:43.093
Countless times.

1309
01:20:44.887 --> 01:20:45.888
I'm sorry. hon.

1310
01:20:47.055 --> 01:20:48.056
Doughnut?

1311
01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:52.936
I think coffee will mask
the antifreeze better.

1312
01:20:53.979 --> 01:20:55.063
And let me just say.

1313
01:20:55.063 --> 01:20:58.817
I couldn't be more thrilled
that this proud American company

1314
01:20:59.484 --> 01:21:01.278
is gonna take over the world.

1315
01:21:01.278 --> 01:21:04.156
Starting with the UK. and then beyond.

1316
01:21:04.156 --> 01:21:07.284
So. everybody. buckle up! Let's do it!

1317
01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:09.828
Thank you. guys. Thank you.

1318
01:21:13.081 --> 01:21:16.168
<i>They say good artists borrow
and great artists steal.</i>

1319
01:21:17.336 --> 01:21:20.130
<i>And Ty was the greatest
bullshit artist around.</i>

1320
01:21:21.673 --> 01:21:23.133
Robbie. baby. There you are.

1321
01:21:25.427 --> 01:21:26.720
I've been looking for you.

1322
01:21:30.516 --> 01:21:31.642
Hope you're not too mad.

1323
01:21:32.768 --> 01:21:33.644
About?

1324
01:21:35.145 --> 01:21:38.357
Foreign expansion plan.
My foreign expansion plan.

1325
01:21:40.359 --> 01:21:43.403
No. I'm glad it's finally happening.

1326
01:21:45.072 --> 01:21:46.406
- Good.
- Good.

1327
01:21:46.907 --> 01:21:47.991
Good. good. good.

1328
01:21:50.536 --> 01:21:53.163
We have a killer UK deal in the works.

1329
01:21:54.039 --> 01:21:57.584
and our distribution partners
are raring to go.

1330
01:21:58.210 --> 01:21:59.086
Amazing.

1331
01:21:59.086 --> 01:22:01.380
It is amazing. yes. I'm excited.

1332
01:22:06.468 --> 01:22:08.095
Hey. the cats came in.

1333
01:22:08.095 --> 01:22:10.389
They're-- Listen.
they're a different color than you wanted.

1334
01:22:10.389 --> 01:22:12.391
- You wanna take a look at them?
- I'm a little busy.

1335
01:22:12.391 --> 01:22:13.475
Okay.

1336
01:22:14.476 --> 01:22:15.894
All right. hot sauce.

1337
01:22:18.689 --> 01:22:20.357
Come find me when you can. okay?

1338
01:22:22.317 --> 01:22:24.111
I bet that guitar looks good on you.

1339
01:22:24.111 --> 01:22:26.655
I-- You--

1340
01:22:26.655 --> 01:22:28.073
You're a mind reader.

1341
01:22:28.073 --> 01:22:29.908
I knew you were gonna say that.

1342
01:22:30.742 --> 01:22:32.703
Come find me. okay?
I wanna show you the cats.

1343
01:22:33.912 --> 01:22:34.913
Okay.

1344
01:22:48.552 --> 01:22:51.847
<i>It took me a while to realize all
the ways hurt people hurt people.</i>

1345
01:22:54.808 --> 01:22:58.770
<i>Turns out. all you have to do to have
a first day of the rest of your life</i>

1346
01:22:59.271 --> 01:23:00.272
<i>is wake the fuck up.</i>

1347
01:23:00.272 --> 01:23:04.067
...job's mainly the phones.
Four hours a day. plus some Saturdays.

1348
01:23:04.568 --> 01:23:06.653
- You said you're in school?
- Yeah. I'm in school--

1349
01:23:06.653 --> 01:23:08.947
<i>Roberta. sweetie.</i>

1350
01:23:08.947 --> 01:23:11.825
<i>you need to come tell me
which one of these looks like marigold.</i>

1351
01:23:11.825 --> 01:23:14.912
You pressed "Intercom All" again. And no.

1352
01:23:16.747 --> 01:23:17.748
Bye.

1353
01:23:22.336 --> 01:23:25.088
Yeah. I'm in school.
but the schedule's not a problem.

1354
01:23:29.343 --> 01:23:30.385
All good?

1355
01:23:31.261 --> 01:23:32.679
Mexico. here we come.

1356
01:23:48.278 --> 01:23:49.738
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1357
01:23:50.864 --> 01:23:52.491
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1358
01:23:58.664 --> 01:23:59.790
Robbie!

1359
01:24:04.837 --> 01:24:05.838
What's going on?

1360
01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:15.722
Robbie.

1361
01:24:45.794 --> 01:24:46.879
Oh. God.

1362
01:24:50.048 --> 01:24:51.049
Okay.

1363
01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:54.261
Shit.

1364
01:25:13.405 --> 01:25:18.368
Sorry. Excuse me.
Sorry. I'm so sorry. Sorry. Okay.

1365
01:25:18.869 --> 01:25:20.078
Just in time.

1366
01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:24.208
You look cute.

1367
01:25:24.875 --> 01:25:26.210
- Thanks.
- Stressed. but cute.

1368
01:25:27.252 --> 01:25:29.087
I'm already an hour late
to Ty's office holiday party.

1369
01:25:29.087 --> 01:25:31.715
I still can't believe he scheduled it
for the same night.

1370
01:25:32.216 --> 01:25:34.593
- Yeah. it's a busy time of year.
- Great job. Dragons.

1371
01:25:34.593 --> 01:25:36.512
- go ahead and stand up.
- Yes. sir.

1372
01:25:36.512 --> 01:25:39.556
Shake. Make circles.

1373
01:25:39.556 --> 01:25:40.849
Mom!

1374
01:25:41.517 --> 01:25:43.435
- They're all calling her a liar!
- What?

1375
01:25:43.435 --> 01:25:45.812
- What happened?
- Hey. sweetheart. Come here.

1376
01:25:45.812 --> 01:25:48.190
- What's going on?
- Drew got a new Spooky

1377
01:25:48.190 --> 01:25:52.486
and the tag doesn't say my name anymore.
so now no one thinks I made it.

1378
01:25:52.486 --> 01:25:55.280
- Sweetheart. of course you made Spooky.
- Yeah.

1379
01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:58.325
I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding.
Let's see.

1380
01:26:03.121 --> 01:26:05.666
This must be just a--
It's a factory mistake...

1381
01:26:05.666 --> 01:26:08.001
- Yes.
- ...or this is a fake Spooky.

1382
01:26:08.001 --> 01:26:10.963
- It's not a real one.
- And whatever it is.

1383
01:26:10.963 --> 01:26:13.715
- it's all gonna be all right. okay?
- Absolutely.

1384
01:26:13.715 --> 01:26:15.968
I'm gonna go see Ty now
and get this whole thing sorted out.

1385
01:26:15.968 --> 01:26:17.052
Yeah?

1386
01:26:17.553 --> 01:26:22.224
In the meantime. I am so proud of you.

1387
01:26:22.224 --> 01:26:24.142
What you--
What's this you're wearing. huh?

1388
01:26:24.142 --> 01:26:25.310
- A green belt.
- Yeah!

1389
01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:28.564
- And I'm a yellow belt!
- Yes. you are.

1390
01:26:28.564 --> 01:26:29.648
Are you gonna celebrate?

1391
01:26:29.648 --> 01:26:31.441
- Yeah.
- Yes. We're having a pizza party. yeah?

1392
01:26:31.441 --> 01:26:32.693
Yay.

1393
01:26:32.693 --> 01:26:35.946
- Yes. we are.
- Yeah. well. Mommy's gotta go.

1394
01:26:36.446 --> 01:26:38.615
But. I love you. I love you.

1395
01:26:38.615 --> 01:26:40.492
- Love you.
- Everything's gonna be okay. Okay?

1396
01:26:40.492 --> 01:26:41.743
- Thank you.
- Call me later.

1397
01:26:42.744 --> 01:26:47.207
So before we go to this pizza party.
how about we burn this fake Spooky?

1398
01:26:49.293 --> 01:26:50.836
A little light arson. maybe?

1399
01:26:50.836 --> 01:26:52.171
What is arson?

1400
01:27:09.021 --> 01:27:11.064
<i>You know.
even when you built your own ship.</i>

1401
01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:14.026
<i>you still gotta protect it from pirates.</i>

1402
01:27:14.860 --> 01:27:17.404
God. I can't wait
to be rid of that douchebag.

1403
01:27:18.989 --> 01:27:20.073
Which one?

1404
01:27:21.074 --> 01:27:25.579
<i>Here he is.
ladies and gentlemen. Ty Warner!</i>

1405
01:27:30.792 --> 01:27:35.255
Hey. everybody! Hi!
Look at all these festive faces.

1406
01:27:35.255 --> 01:27:37.132
I hope you're all enjoying the party?

1407
01:27:38.634 --> 01:27:41.136
And I hope everybody
is enjoying the present?

1408
01:27:41.136 --> 01:27:44.097
- Yeah!
- Those little bears.

1409
01:27:44.097 --> 01:27:48.810
Those little bears. I guarantee are worth
$10.000 already on the World Wide Web.

1410
01:27:50.354 --> 01:27:56.735
Those little cuties! And as a holiday
bonus this year. everyone's--

1411
01:27:57.861 --> 01:27:59.071
Drumroll. please.

1412
01:28:00.531 --> 01:28:02.991
Everyone's getting double their salary!

1413
01:28:04.201 --> 01:28:05.202
What?

1414
01:28:06.203 --> 01:28:08.789
Double your salary!

1415
01:28:12.501 --> 01:28:14.670
Feel the energy of the room!

1416
01:28:16.380 --> 01:28:18.465
Feel the energy of Ty Inc.!

1417
01:28:20.133 --> 01:28:22.761
Merry Christmas. everyone.
Merry Christmas.

1418
01:28:22.761 --> 01:28:24.638
Happy Hanukkah. whatever it is.

1419
01:28:25.347 --> 01:28:31.436
It has been an extra special year.
and we are an extra special company.

1420
01:28:31.436 --> 01:28:32.521
Yes.

1421
01:28:32.521 --> 01:28:36.567
- We're amazingly unique. as you all know.
- Yep.

1422
01:28:36.567 --> 01:28:40.237
And because of that.
we're doing amazingly well.

1423
01:28:40.237 --> 01:28:43.824
- We are winners.
- Yes!

1424
01:28:43.824 --> 01:28:46.368
We create demand.

1425
01:28:47.661 --> 01:28:50.122
And this year.
we're gonna move more product than ever!

1426
01:28:50.122 --> 01:28:51.665
Yes!

1427
01:28:51.665 --> 01:28:54.168
- Because at Ty Inc. you go big...
- Wait. what?

1428
01:28:54.168 --> 01:28:55.961
...or you go home!

1429
01:28:56.670 --> 01:28:58.046
That's right.

1430
01:29:00.090 --> 01:29:03.468
How fun is this?
Blaine's coming on board full time.

1431
01:29:04.303 --> 01:29:06.305
- There he is.
- See a lot more of me. Right?

1432
01:29:06.305 --> 01:29:09.641
So I can go all in
on new design and innovation.

1433
01:29:10.225 --> 01:29:16.273
I have loved taking Ty Inc.
from millions to billions.

1434
01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:22.237
From the website to retirements.
steering the market. everything.

1435
01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:25.824
And there's so much more to come.

1436
01:29:26.325 --> 01:29:29.620
We're headed for the best year ever!

1437
01:29:32.581 --> 01:29:34.666
Merry Christmas. everybody!

1438
01:29:34.666 --> 01:29:38.921
- Enjoy the party!
- Ty! Ty!

1439
01:29:47.513 --> 01:29:49.640
To think I actually believed him.

1440
01:29:51.517 --> 01:29:52.935
I'm sorry it hurts. honey.

1441
01:29:54.228 --> 01:29:56.939
Your problem is. you don't know
you're playing a rigged game.

1442
01:29:58.774 --> 01:30:00.192
But if it's any comfort.

1443
01:30:00.192 --> 01:30:04.279
at least you had the privilege
of believing in the first place.

1444
01:30:09.576 --> 01:30:11.036
Oh. honey.

1445
01:30:13.664 --> 01:30:15.666
You gotta come on a jump sometime.

1446
01:30:17.668 --> 01:30:22.798
God. he looks terrible.
Look at the bags under his eyes.

1447
01:30:24.883 --> 01:30:26.301
I've been looking for you. Maya.

1448
01:30:28.637 --> 01:30:29.721
I've been right here.

1449
01:30:32.558 --> 01:30:34.268
Don't be mad.

1450
01:30:34.268 --> 01:30:35.853
Blaine's just a figurehead.

1451
01:30:37.187 --> 01:30:40.566
You know you're always
my secret weapon. You know that.

1452
01:30:44.695 --> 01:30:45.821
Look.

1453
01:30:45.821 --> 01:30:47.614
I wanted to tell you. I'm...

1454
01:30:50.033 --> 01:30:55.163
bumping you up to $20 an hour.
Twenty smackeroos.

1455
01:30:58.542 --> 01:31:02.713
- I'm done. Ty. I'm through.
- What do you mean?

1456
01:31:02.713 --> 01:31:08.010
I'm not your secret weapon. I'm
not a secret. and I'm not yours. I quit.

1457
01:31:10.721 --> 01:31:11.722
Wanna dance?

1458
01:31:11.722 --> 01:31:13.515
- Maya. Maya.
- Absolutely.

1459
01:31:13.515 --> 01:31:14.600
Okay.

1460
01:31:17.728 --> 01:31:20.230
<i>I never imagined
just walking away from Ty.</i>

1461
01:31:23.275 --> 01:31:27.571
<i>But once you do. man. does it feel good.</i>

1462
01:31:41.043 --> 01:31:46.423
<i>The thing about Ty is.
he draws you in. wins your trust.</i>

1463
01:31:50.093 --> 01:31:55.724
<i>When things get bumpy. you just think
he's complicated. a little damaged.</i>

1464
01:31:58.268 --> 01:31:59.895
<i>You wanna keep believing in him...</i>

1465
01:32:03.148 --> 01:32:04.149
<i>until...</i>

1466
01:32:07.736 --> 01:32:09.655
<i>you just can't anymore.</i>

1467
01:32:25.504 --> 01:32:28.924
I mean. what's the big problem
with disillusionment. right?

1468
01:32:28.924 --> 01:32:33.804
I mean. who wants to live
in "illusionment?" Not me.

1469
01:32:34.471 --> 01:32:36.265
Hey. Maya. Have you seen Ty?

1470
01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:39.935
Oh. Sheila. Oh. no.

1471
01:32:41.061 --> 01:32:45.983
I want so much better for you.
For all of us. It's--

1472
01:32:49.987 --> 01:32:50.988
You okay. honey?

1473
01:32:50.988 --> 01:32:54.157
Oh. yeah. Yeah. I will be.

1474
01:32:54.783 --> 01:32:55.617
Yeah?

1475
01:32:57.494 --> 01:32:59.538
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

1476
01:33:01.665 --> 01:33:04.918
Why did Ty change the Spooky tag?

1477
01:33:06.295 --> 01:33:07.296
Is he--

1478
01:33:08.338 --> 01:33:10.841
Is he so insecure
he had to take credit away from a child?

1479
01:33:16.138 --> 01:33:20.809
You know. it's-- The funny thing is. like.
all the ones with the Ava tag

1480
01:33:21.310 --> 01:33:24.146
are worth way more
since he discontinued them.

1481
01:33:24.146 --> 01:33:25.230
Like--

1482
01:33:27.399 --> 01:33:29.860
But you know. it's not gonna matter
much longer. 'cause...

1483
01:33:31.111 --> 01:33:32.112
What do you mean?

1484
01:33:33.113 --> 01:33:34.907
Well. I mean--

1485
01:33:36.783 --> 01:33:37.784
Main bar.

1486
01:33:37.784 --> 01:33:39.244
It's all gonna go...

1487
01:33:40.913 --> 01:33:44.666
Okay. got a scotch and a chocolate milk?

1488
01:33:44.666 --> 01:33:45.918
Well. the scotch I can do.

1489
01:33:45.918 --> 01:33:49.755
but we don't do a lot of chocolate milk.
so it'll take us--

1490
01:33:50.714 --> 01:33:55.719
Yes. sir. Room 1433. We are on it.

1491
01:34:22.746 --> 01:34:24.081
Did you order something?

1492
01:34:24.081 --> 01:34:28.418
No. No. I did not.

1493
01:34:31.672 --> 01:34:35.425
Okay. I'll tell them to get lost.

1494
01:34:50.607 --> 01:34:51.775
You must be Sheila.

1495
01:34:54.903 --> 01:34:55.988
I'm Robbie.

1496
01:34:58.824 --> 01:35:01.076
Hey. did I tell you I bought a hotel?

1497
01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:05.330
I'm sorry this is how we're meeting.

1498
01:35:08.834 --> 01:35:11.962
It doesn't mean anything. if that helps.

1499
01:35:14.298 --> 01:35:16.049
I just like to show him who's boss.

1500
01:35:35.777 --> 01:35:37.905
What the fuck are you doing here?

1501
01:35:37.905 --> 01:35:40.157
You are making a huge mistake. Robbie.

1502
01:35:40.782 --> 01:35:43.702
We-- I mean. we belong together.
Who's that?

1503
01:35:43.702 --> 01:35:46.246
You followed me to Mexico.

1504
01:35:48.123 --> 01:35:52.836
Of course I followed you. I'll follow you
anywhere. We belong together.

1505
01:35:53.962 --> 01:35:58.467
No one will ever love you
the way that I do.

1506
01:36:01.011 --> 01:36:02.012
Promise?

1507
01:36:10.187 --> 01:36:11.271
Who was that?

1508
01:36:12.564 --> 01:36:13.732
Sheila.

1509
01:36:15.234 --> 01:36:16.235
She's lovely.

1510
01:36:16.902 --> 01:36:21.490
No. No!

1511
01:36:21.490 --> 01:36:23.909
What happened? What did you say to her?

1512
01:36:24.409 --> 01:36:26.870
- Nothing. really.
- Okay. good. If I have her call you.

1513
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:28.872
will you just say this was work?

1514
01:36:30.290 --> 01:36:31.583
What did you think it was?

1515
01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:38.048
Robbie!

1516
01:36:39.842 --> 01:36:44.137
You're fired. you hear me?
You get nothing! You get nothing. Robbie!

1517
01:36:44.137 --> 01:36:45.639
You're dead to me!

1518
01:36:47.432 --> 01:36:48.475
Robbie!

1519
01:36:52.187 --> 01:36:53.230
Robbie!

1520
01:36:54.398 --> 01:36:55.232
Wanna swim?

1521
01:37:05.617 --> 01:37:06.618
Come on.

1522
01:37:11.582 --> 01:37:12.791
Okay. Sheila. Listen.

1523
01:37:13.834 --> 01:37:17.838
- Oh. fuck.
- Oh. God. Wha--

1524
01:37:19.464 --> 01:37:22.259
My face. Oh. God.

1525
01:37:24.386 --> 01:37:27.222
Oh. God.

1526
01:37:30.851 --> 01:37:35.564
<i>President Clinton
asked noted educator Dr. Maya Angelou</i>

1527
01:37:35.564 --> 01:37:39.443
<i>to compose a poem for this historic day.</i>

1528
01:37:40.027 --> 01:37:42.696
<i>If we knew at the beginning
what we did by the end.</i>

1529
01:37:42.696 --> 01:37:44.114
<i>would we do it all the same?</i>

1530
01:37:44.114 --> 01:37:46.283
<i>...and Americans everywhere.</i>

1531
01:37:46.283 --> 01:37:51.288
<i>A Rock. A River. A Tree</i>

1532
01:37:51.288 --> 01:37:54.625
<i>Hosts to species long since departed...</i>

1533
01:37:56.960 --> 01:37:57.961
Who are you?

1534
01:37:58.670 --> 01:38:00.547
Maya. New receptionist.

1535
01:38:00.547 --> 01:38:05.260
I saw you on your way out a few weeks ago.
but we didn't get to meet.

1536
01:38:07.471 --> 01:38:09.932
Well. welcome. new receptionist Maya.

1537
01:38:09.932 --> 01:38:11.642
- Thank you.
- Let me ask you something.

1538
01:38:12.768 --> 01:38:14.061
Do you stand up for yourself?

1539
01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:18.315
Yeah. Every day.

1540
01:38:18.315 --> 01:38:19.858
Is Ty here?

1541
01:38:19.858 --> 01:38:22.152
Yeah. and he's running
super late for an appointment.

1542
01:38:22.152 --> 01:38:23.654
- so he should be leaving any second.
- Hey. out.

1543
01:38:23.654 --> 01:38:25.656
- I'm just here to pick up...
- You're not welcome here.

1544
01:38:25.656 --> 01:38:28.450
- ...the rest of my things. No. I--
- Get out. Out!

1545
01:38:29.743 --> 01:38:33.622
- Did you get a face-lift? You didn't.
- Don't touch my face.

1546
01:38:33.622 --> 01:38:36.792
Do not touch my face. Out. please.

1547
01:38:37.376 --> 01:38:41.839
I should tell you. the foreign
expansion plan. it was a terrible idea.

1548
01:38:41.839 --> 01:38:43.215
The UK is a disaster.

1549
01:38:43.215 --> 01:38:46.385
Oh. no. Don't tell me your door-to-door
preachers aren't working out?

1550
01:38:46.385 --> 01:38:48.637
Don't give me that.
You raved about the idea.

1551
01:38:48.637 --> 01:38:51.390
You said it was brilliant.
You said it was genius.

1552
01:38:51.390 --> 01:38:54.393
I don't recall saying that. Not to you.

1553
01:38:57.938 --> 01:38:59.982
You're a fraud.

1554
01:38:59.982 --> 01:39:03.777
And I will never. ever.
ever talk to you again. Ever!

1555
01:39:04.653 --> 01:39:06.071
Aren't you late?

1556
01:39:06.071 --> 01:39:08.907
I'm the one asking you to leave.
I'm asking you to get out.

1557
01:39:08.907 --> 01:39:09.992
Could we have security?

1558
01:39:09.992 --> 01:39:11.952
Your assistant said
you're late for an appointment.

1559
01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:14.538
Ty Inc. How can I help you?

1560
01:39:14.538 --> 01:39:16.915
<i>This is Sheila Harper
from Oak Brook Lighting.</i>

1561
01:39:16.915 --> 01:39:19.418
<i>I'm at Mr. Warner's new residence
for our meeting.</i>

1562
01:39:19.418 --> 01:39:22.546
Yeah. I'm so sorry.
He's obviously running really late.

1563
01:39:23.463 --> 01:39:25.716
He's in the middle of something right now.

1564
01:39:25.716 --> 01:39:28.302
Well. I've been waiting since 9:00.
Does he need to reschedule?

1565
01:39:28.302 --> 01:39:31.138
Honestly. if I were you. I'd just bail.

1566
01:39:34.057 --> 01:39:36.810
<i>But we didn't bail. We leaned in.</i>

1567
01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:43.609
Are we sure
we don't have any other options?

1568
01:39:43.609 --> 01:39:46.236
I'm kinda new here. Ty.

1569
01:39:47.279 --> 01:39:48.739
It's such a mess over there.

1570
01:39:50.741 --> 01:39:51.992
God. I hate this!

1571
01:39:53.118 --> 01:39:54.328
Okay. dial for me. please.

1572
01:39:54.328 --> 01:39:55.412
Yep.

1573
01:40:00.542 --> 01:40:01.543
Shut the door.

1574
01:40:05.797 --> 01:40:07.633
-<i>Hello.</i>
- Roberta.

1575
01:40:08.217 --> 01:40:11.678
Well. look what the understuffed
posable cat dragged in.

1576
01:40:12.679 --> 01:40:14.223
I think you know why I'm calling.

1577
01:40:14.223 --> 01:40:18.143
Listen. I need you to come back and
help me out. I need you to fix the UK.

1578
01:40:19.353 --> 01:40:20.354
No.

1579
01:40:20.354 --> 01:40:23.732
Okay. Robbie. please.
I really just need you. okay?

1580
01:40:24.316 --> 01:40:25.984
Why would you need me. Ty?

1581
01:40:29.530 --> 01:40:31.823
Because I can't do it without you.

1582
01:40:33.116 --> 01:40:34.451
<i>I'm sorry. what was that?</i>

1583
01:40:34.451 --> 01:40:37.079
"I can't do it without you."
is what I said.

1584
01:40:37.079 --> 01:40:39.706
No fucking shit.

1585
01:40:41.542 --> 01:40:43.210
But the answer's still no.

1586
01:40:43.210 --> 01:40:46.088
<i>What? Why? Why?</i>

1587
01:40:46.588 --> 01:40:50.717
Because I'll never. ever. ever. ever.
ever. ever work for you again. Ty. Ever.

1588
01:40:51.802 --> 01:40:53.178
But you can work for me.

1589
01:40:55.138 --> 01:40:58.308
- What are you talking about?
-<i>I'm starting my own company.</i>

1590
01:40:58.308 --> 01:40:59.810
And it happens to be available

1591
01:40:59.810 --> 01:41:03.313
to be the exclusive wholesaler
of Ty products in the UK.

1592
01:41:04.982 --> 01:41:07.818
Wait. are you being--
Is this-- Are you being serious?

1593
01:41:08.402 --> 01:41:13.699
Deadly. You want me to fix the UK?
Those are my terms. I run the UK.

1594
01:41:16.201 --> 01:41:18.161
Okay. I'm gonna put you
on hold for two seconds.

1595
01:41:18.662 --> 01:41:20.080
God Almighty!

1596
01:41:24.793 --> 01:41:25.794
God!

1597
01:41:29.131 --> 01:41:31.592
Okay. just get it fixed.

1598
01:41:31.592 --> 01:41:34.136
I will. Nice doing business with you. Ty.

1599
01:41:34.136 --> 01:41:35.429
Shut up.

1600
01:41:38.724 --> 01:41:40.184
<i>He got one thing right.</i>

1601
01:41:44.229 --> 01:41:46.273
<i>You gotta build your own fucking ship.</i>

1602
01:41:47.774 --> 01:41:48.901
<i>So I did.</i>

1603
01:41:50.319 --> 01:41:54.031
<i>We all did. And not a minute too soon.</i>

1604
01:41:56.950 --> 01:41:59.786
<i>The Beanie market
has crashed spectacularly.</i>

1605
01:41:59.786 --> 01:42:03.498
<i>From gold to garbage.
The Beanie Baby bubble has popped.</i>

1606
01:42:04.374 --> 01:42:06.502
{\an8}A veritable Beanie Baby apocalypse.

1607
01:42:07.503 --> 01:42:10.214
<i>By the end of '99. all that money.</i>

1608
01:42:10.214 --> 01:42:15.010
<i>$20 billion worth of Beanie wealth. evaporated.</i>

1609
01:42:19.097 --> 01:42:21.308
<i>That's the whole point of America. right?</i>

1610
01:42:21.308 --> 01:42:24.436
<i>Everybody chasing something
too good to be true.</i>

1611
01:42:30.734 --> 01:42:32.402
<i>And there's always another hustle.</i>

1612
01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:36.865
{\an8}<i>Always a next new thing.</i>

1613
01:42:40.202 --> 01:42:41.954
<i>There's always another player.</i>

1614
01:42:44.414 --> 01:42:47.125
<i>What you gotta do is beat the game.</i>

1615
01:42:47.125 --> 01:42:48.210
Maya-<i>san</i>...

1616
01:42:49.378 --> 01:42:52.881
We'd like to discuss something with you.
This card will be a big hit.

1617
01:42:53.966 --> 01:42:55.592
So these are our "Pokemans"?

1618
01:42:55.592 --> 01:42:56.885
Pokémons.

1619
01:42:56.885 --> 01:42:58.178
- Pokémon.
- What?

1620
01:42:58.178 --> 01:42:59.555
- Pokémon.
- Just Pokémon.

1621
01:43:00.055 --> 01:43:01.557
- Just Pokémon.
- Pokémon. Okay.

1622
01:43:01.557 --> 01:43:03.684
Just keep on poking them on.

1623
01:43:05.102 --> 01:43:09.606
It's so. so gorgeous here. And warm.

1624
01:43:10.941 --> 01:43:12.109
You should come visit.

1625
01:43:12.860 --> 01:43:14.945
<i>And you really think
you're there for good?</i>

1626
01:43:14.945 --> 01:43:16.780
Oh. yeah. I mean. Ava's Spookies.

1627
01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:23.287
they paid for the whole house and the car
and both girls' school through college.

1628
01:43:23.287 --> 01:43:24.997
-<i>Oh. Jesus.</i>
- Uh-huh.

1629
01:43:24.997 --> 01:43:27.082
-<i>Seconds before the crash.</i>
- Uh-huh.

1630
01:43:27.624 --> 01:43:29.877
<i>You really did get out just in time.</i>

1631
01:43:30.502 --> 01:43:31.628
In so many ways.

1632
01:43:32.921 --> 01:43:35.507
<i>You sound happy. For real.</i>

1633
01:43:36.008 --> 01:43:38.635
I am. You know. I really am. I--

1634
01:43:39.178 --> 01:43:40.846
Do you know I realized
what the problem was.

1635
01:43:40.846 --> 01:43:42.931
It wasn't relying on the wrong man.

1636
01:43:42.931 --> 01:43:46.143
It was. I don't know.
having the wrong man rely on us.
