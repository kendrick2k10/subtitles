00:00:41.171 --> 00:00:42.825
<i>Let's go. D. Hodges!</i>

4
00:00:42.912 --> 00:00:44.305
<i>I'm walking here!</i>

5
00:00:54.532 --> 00:00:56.578
Ow!

6
00:00:56.665 --> 00:00:58.232
<i>Cut it out. cut it out!</i>

DANIEL
When I first learned
about that video

8
00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:19.949
that went around
on the internet

9
00:01:20.036 --> 00:01:22.256
about our defense
in the tunnel.

10
00:01:22.343 --> 00:01:24.823
I hit play.
and I watched what happened.

11
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.174
and I hit pause.
and I wrote down what happened.

12
00:01:29.132 --> 00:01:31.091
And I kept doing that
until I reached the end.

13
00:01:38.185 --> 00:01:40.535
I was embarrassed.

14
00:01:40.622 --> 00:01:44.104
No one wants their 15 minutes of
fame to be crying out for help.

15
00:01:44.191 --> 00:01:48.499
you know. especially if your job
is a police officer.

16
00:01:48.586 --> 00:01:51.285
But ultimately. I'm glad that
it got out and got around.

17
00:01:51.372 --> 00:01:54.592
because it's important
to get the truth out

18
00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:56.681
about what happened.

19
00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.648
I almost feel like somebody else
took these photos.

20
00:02:06.735 --> 00:02:08.345
But it was me.

21
00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:14.917
I will always think about
what happened that day.

22
00:02:15.004 --> 00:02:19.051
I will always have these photos
to tell these stories.

23
00:02:24.187 --> 00:02:28.844
I'm trying to capture images
showing you one of the most

24
00:02:28.931 --> 00:02:32.935
important times
in American history.

25
00:02:34.371 --> 00:02:39.507
And I can't wait for the day
where I think that my son

26
00:02:39.594 --> 00:02:44.294
will be interested so I can
explain to him what happened.

27
00:02:44.381 --> 00:02:46.601
that I was there
at the Capitol building.

28
00:02:46.688 --> 00:02:49.952
I was scared for my fucking
life. and you know.

29
00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:51.083
I thought about you.

30
00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:56.698
There's no way I can forget.

31
00:02:59.396 --> 00:03:02.660
When footage of that day
was replayed.

32
00:03:02.747 --> 00:03:05.750
and even today is replayed.
I change the channel.

33
00:03:05.837 --> 00:03:09.667
And I still don't like
to watch it. I just. I can't.

34
00:03:09.754 --> 00:03:11.321
I didn't want to think about it
anymore.

35
00:03:11.408 --> 00:03:17.719
I really. I tried really hard.
as best I could.

36
00:03:17.806 --> 00:03:19.851
to block that day out.

37
00:03:26.336 --> 00:03:31.385
I didn't really share
immediately with. like. family

38
00:03:31.472 --> 00:03:34.866
what really went down. um.
but I've thought about

39
00:03:34.953 --> 00:03:37.521
January 6th a lot. you know
and trying to wrap

40
00:03:37.608 --> 00:03:39.871
my head around really
what happened that day.

41
00:03:42.004 --> 00:03:44.049
When I look back
and I think back.

42
00:03:44.136 --> 00:03:47.444
the gravity of everything
that that happened.

43
00:03:47.531 --> 00:03:51.883
this is history. People be
talking about this for years.

44
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.060
And here I sit dead center.

45
00:03:55.147 --> 00:03:57.149
four days on the job...

46
00:03:58.368 --> 00:04:02.938
four days and the weight
of the world on your shoulders.

47
00:04:04.548 --> 00:04:08.160
I want everyone to know.

48
00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:10.815
there was a huge price to pay

49
00:04:10.902 --> 00:04:16.865
for our democracy on that day.

50
00:04:20.738 --> 00:04:22.218
Sure. where do you
want me to go?

51
00:04:22.305 --> 00:04:23.785
Right back in the...

52
00:04:26.962 --> 00:04:30.400
I was there.
I knew what happened.

53
00:04:30.487 --> 00:04:33.751
I was there all day.
and it's rare that you get

54
00:04:33.838 --> 00:04:37.277
the opportunity to put your
finger on the scale of history.

55
00:04:38.452 --> 00:04:42.847
And influence things in a way

56
00:04:42.934 --> 00:04:45.589
that brings the truth to light.

57
00:04:59.342 --> 00:05:02.476
My dad said democracy
needs the ground to stand on.

58
00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:04.478
and that ground is the truth.

59
00:05:06.218 --> 00:05:07.394
So. we gotta tell the truth.

60
00:05:10.614 --> 00:05:12.224
If we can handle it.

61
00:05:16.272 --> 00:05:18.448
The greatest strength
of democracy is that

62
00:05:18.535 --> 00:05:20.842
it comes from the people.

63
00:05:20.929 --> 00:05:24.715
The weakness of democracy
is that it has so many enemies.

64
00:05:24.802 --> 00:05:28.502
other pretenders to the throne.

65
00:05:30.591 --> 00:05:32.027
They always describe
Donald Trump

66
00:05:32.114 --> 00:05:35.030
as a larger-than-life figure.

67
00:05:35.117 --> 00:05:37.467
I'm appreciating that people
are not larger than life.

68
00:05:37.554 --> 00:05:40.949
people are just the right size
for a democracy

69
00:05:41.036 --> 00:05:43.865
where everybody gets one vote.

70
00:05:43.952 --> 00:05:47.477
one voice. and we need
everybody to participate.

71
00:06:26.255 --> 00:06:29.867
Good afternoon. When I think
about the most basic way

72
00:06:29.954 --> 00:06:34.002
to explain the importance of
elections in the United States.

73
00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:37.179
there's a phrase that always
comes to mind.

74
00:06:37.266 --> 00:06:41.226
It may sound straightforward.
but it's meaningful...

75
00:06:41.313 --> 00:06:43.925
Sometimes the truth is like
a second chance.

76
00:06:44.012 --> 00:06:45.143
and I believe that.

77
00:06:52.716 --> 00:06:53.935
You ready?

78
00:07:17.611 --> 00:07:19.439
Morning. morning.

79
00:07:25.923 --> 00:07:30.232
Ten bucks. ten bucks.
Hats and shirts.

80
00:07:32.321 --> 00:07:34.758
I'm a native son.

81
00:07:34.845 --> 00:07:37.718
This is the city that raised me.
and. you know.

82
00:07:37.805 --> 00:07:41.156
as crazy as this sounds.
I felt like everything

83
00:07:41.243 --> 00:07:43.811
that I had gone through here
in this city prepared me

84
00:07:43.898 --> 00:07:46.074
to be the chief of police
that I was on that day.

85
00:07:53.342 --> 00:07:55.518
I officially took over the job
as chief of police

86
00:07:55.605 --> 00:08:00.436
on January the 2nd. so 4 days
before January the 6th.

87
00:08:00.523 --> 00:08:02.786
Whether that was destiny
or whether it was just you know.

88
00:08:02.873 --> 00:08:06.224
I drew the short straw.
I don't know.

89
00:08:06.311 --> 00:08:08.052
- Whose streets?
- Our streets.

90
00:08:08.139 --> 00:08:09.924
- Whose streets?
- Our streets.

91
00:08:10.011 --> 00:08:12.274
- Whose streets?
- Our streets.

92
00:08:13.884 --> 00:08:16.583
It conjures up memories
of what happened on that day.

93
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:19.368
kind of hits you in the gut.

94
00:08:19.455 --> 00:08:22.371
The officers are here below.
I mean look at these people

95
00:08:22.458 --> 00:08:25.026
that are standing overhead.
right.

96
00:08:25.113 --> 00:08:27.898
and we're not knowing
who's armed in the crowd.

97
00:08:27.985 --> 00:08:31.293
We had already recovered
firearms and so forth. so...

98
00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.165
I mean. there's just
a huge sense of vulnerability.

99
00:08:36.254 --> 00:08:38.735
People were running for their
lives that day.

100
00:08:38.822 --> 00:08:42.347
and it didn't matter.
it didn't matter what side

101
00:08:42.434 --> 00:08:44.480
of the fence you were on.
Republican or Democrat.

102
00:08:44.567 --> 00:08:46.308
it didn't matter.

103
00:08:46.395 --> 00:08:50.530
And for people to pretend
like nothing happened...

104
00:08:51.792 --> 00:08:53.707
it really. really angers me.

105
00:08:57.449 --> 00:08:59.364
Hats and shirts. ten bucks!

106
00:09:02.063 --> 00:09:06.894
That day. I rode into work
and there were a lot of people

107
00:09:06.981 --> 00:09:10.027
already out at like 6:30.
7:00 in the morning.

108
00:09:10.114 --> 00:09:12.029
converging on downtown.

109
00:09:15.729 --> 00:09:19.471
MPD's role.
it's unique in our city.

110
00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:22.736
There are different entities
that work together in order

111
00:09:22.823 --> 00:09:25.347
to provide safety
and security in our city.

112
00:09:25.434 --> 00:09:27.610
You have the United States
Secret Service

113
00:09:27.697 --> 00:09:31.179
who has responsibility
for the White House itself.

114
00:09:31.266 --> 00:09:33.050
You have the United States
Capitol Police

115
00:09:33.137 --> 00:09:35.139
that are responsible
for the Capitol.

116
00:09:35.226 --> 00:09:36.576
and the Metropolitan
Police Department

117
00:09:36.924 --> 00:09:39.970
is responsible for all
of the rest of the city

118
00:09:40.057 --> 00:09:44.235
where people eat. live.
work everyday in our city.

119
00:09:44.322 --> 00:09:46.107
Go Trump!

120
00:09:46.194 --> 00:09:48.413
USA. USA!

121
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.980
Come and get your Trump hats.

122
00:09:50.067 --> 00:09:52.287
Here it is folks!

123
00:09:52.374 --> 00:09:54.245
Good morning. everyone.

124
00:09:54.332 --> 00:09:56.247
With all the rhetoric
that was happening

125
00:09:56.334 --> 00:09:59.337
leading up to January 6th.
we expected something big.

126
00:09:59.424 --> 00:10:01.818
Certainly. there was a lot of
internet chatter and you know.

127
00:10:01.905 --> 00:10:05.300
intelligence information going
back and forth that said

128
00:10:05.387 --> 00:10:07.911
a whole bunch
of different things.

129
00:10:07.998 --> 00:10:11.306
We had requested support from
other law enforcement agencies.

130
00:10:11.393 --> 00:10:14.570
and we requested the services
of the National Guard

131
00:10:14.657 --> 00:10:18.530
from the Secretary of the Army
to assist us in managing traffic

132
00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:20.707
so that police officers
would not be tied up

133
00:10:20.794 --> 00:10:23.013
dealing with traffic control.

134
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.841
But there was a lot of back
and forth

135
00:10:24.928 --> 00:10:29.280
and a lot of discussion
about optics.

136
00:10:29.367 --> 00:10:34.329
And even once they got approval.
I was told the National Guard

137
00:10:34.416 --> 00:10:37.985
could not move East of 9th
Street without the approval

138
00:10:38.072 --> 00:10:40.117
of the Secretary of the Army.

139
00:10:40.204 --> 00:10:43.033
And quite frankly.
I was a little shocked.

140
00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:48.560
We would need approval at that
level of government to move

141
00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:52.652
personnel. you know. a few
blocks over from where they are.

142
00:10:52.739 --> 00:10:55.524
I mean that is. that's like.
like huge. right?

143
00:10:55.611 --> 00:10:57.047
That never happens.

144
00:11:04.185 --> 00:11:07.579
I'd been documenting protests
and marches for over a year

145
00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:10.670
at that point. it seems like.

146
00:11:10.757 --> 00:11:12.759
I started going to Trump rallies

147
00:11:12.846 --> 00:11:15.936
because Trump
is a part of the story.

148
00:11:17.807 --> 00:11:22.725
As a photographer.
what was very significant to me

149
00:11:22.812 --> 00:11:26.250
are the people and the people
that were there to attend

150
00:11:26.337 --> 00:11:28.035
the rally.

151
00:11:35.259 --> 00:11:37.827
Part of the reason I do
what I do when it comes

152
00:11:37.914 --> 00:11:41.526
to these protests is document.
you know. the both sides.

153
00:11:43.746 --> 00:11:47.663
I mean. here's this young Black
wearing a fucking

154
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:51.188
Make America
Great Again red cap.

155
00:11:51.275 --> 00:11:53.495
I couldn't believe it.

156
00:11:53.582 --> 00:11:56.063
What the fuck are you doing?
What are you doing here?

157
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.152
Why. ugh.

158
00:12:00.589 --> 00:12:03.200
Why am I here? Man.
I'm here for President Trump.

159
00:12:03.287 --> 00:12:07.422
I'm here put that energy
in a bucket. man. like...

160
00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:10.033
You start talking to these MAGA
people. and you just become

161
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.558
fascinated with their values

162
00:12:13.645 --> 00:12:15.996
and their thought process

163
00:12:16.083 --> 00:12:19.564
and why they believe
what they believe.

164
00:12:22.219 --> 00:12:26.267
...understand and know
that this is a cause

165
00:12:26.354 --> 00:12:29.705
must also understand that
it is a righteous cause.

166
00:12:35.798 --> 00:12:38.714
This is where I knew.
and I was like. "Ah. shit.

167
00:12:38.801 --> 00:12:41.282
we got the Confederate
flag out this bad boy?"

168
00:12:43.545 --> 00:12:44.981
Fucking crazy.

169
00:12:45.721 --> 00:12:49.159
It's the first time I've ever
seen a Confederate
flag in person.

170
00:12:49.246 --> 00:12:53.729
I've never seen one in
my life right before my eyes.

171
00:12:53.816 --> 00:12:55.165
No.

172
00:12:55.252 --> 00:12:57.254
This is the first time.
Washington. DC.

173
00:12:57.341 --> 00:12:59.213
January 6th. 2021.

174
00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:06.307
I thought. you might need to
definitely more than usual.

175
00:13:06.394 --> 00:13:09.049
keep your head on a swivel.

176
00:13:17.274 --> 00:13:20.451
I follow the news. I'm aware
of the political climate

177
00:13:20.538 --> 00:13:22.584
in this country
and how divisive things

178
00:13:22.671 --> 00:13:24.847
have been in recent times.

179
00:13:24.934 --> 00:13:28.895
So. I'd absolutely understand
when communities of color feel

180
00:13:28.982 --> 00:13:31.593
feel like they've been
mistreated by law enforcement

181
00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.465
because there is
absolutely a history
of that in this country.

182
00:13:34.552 --> 00:13:38.208
And. I'm not
ignorant of the past.

183
00:13:38.295 --> 00:13:39.644
I am not ignorant
of the present.

184
00:13:43.735 --> 00:13:47.043
With that said. in 2020.
we would work 18 hours a day

185
00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.611
with no days off
for like a month at least.

186
00:13:49.698 --> 00:13:51.265
and from a law enforcement
perspective.

187
00:13:51.352 --> 00:13:53.484
that was the
backdrop for January 6th.

188
00:13:55.573 --> 00:13:58.881
That day. we're posted
along Constitution Avenue.

189
00:13:58.968 --> 00:14:01.666
The thing that really stood out
were those who were wearing

190
00:14:01.753 --> 00:14:06.584
ballistic vests. helmets.
goggles. fire gloves.

191
00:14:06.671 --> 00:14:09.196
backpacks packed full
of who knows what.

192
00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:13.461
that was concerning obviously
but that in it of itself isn't

193
00:14:13.548 --> 00:14:15.985
something that we
can stop people for.

194
00:14:16.072 --> 00:14:19.075
Keep it going. come on.
keep the march going.

195
00:14:19.162 --> 00:14:21.643
You've got a great march
going here. come on.

196
00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:23.166
At one point. some people
with tact gear came up

197
00:14:23.253 --> 00:14:25.038
to one of my colleagues

198
00:14:25.125 --> 00:14:27.910
and said. "Is this all
the police officers you have?"

199
00:14:28.128 --> 00:14:29.694
And my colleague looked down
at him. and was just confused.

200
00:14:29.781 --> 00:14:32.262
like. uh. didn't know
how to respond.

201
00:14:32.349 --> 00:14:35.962
And then the guy also said.
"Do you really think
you could stop us?

202
00:14:38.965 --> 00:14:41.706
So that was rather ominous.

203
00:14:44.144 --> 00:14:45.972
So. I'm checking out
the landscape of the city.

204
00:14:46.059 --> 00:14:47.974
- Whose streets?
- Our streets!

205
00:14:48.061 --> 00:14:50.193
- Whose streets?
- Our streets!

206
00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:53.718
I'm in the car. and there
were a group of individuals

207
00:14:53.805 --> 00:14:57.984
marching in formation. which
is what caught my attention.

208
00:14:58.071 --> 00:15:00.073
They were walking
towards the US Capitol.

209
00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.378
And I took a picture of that.

210
00:15:01.465 --> 00:15:02.684
Where's Antifa?

211
00:15:02.771 --> 00:15:04.468
Where's Antifa?

212
00:15:04.555 --> 00:15:06.514
Where's Antifa?

213
00:15:06.601 --> 00:15:09.212
Some of them were wearing
orange skull caps.

214
00:15:09.299 --> 00:15:11.998
and they had. like.
these ballistic vests on.

215
00:15:12.955 --> 00:15:16.350
Obviously. I'm thinking about.
you know. some type of training.

216
00:15:16.437 --> 00:15:19.788
prior law enforcement.
potentially military. potentially.

217
00:15:19.875 --> 00:15:21.485
I'm thinking about
all those things.

218
00:15:21.572 --> 00:15:24.314
And I reached out to our
Homeland Security Chief

219
00:15:24.401 --> 00:15:27.752
and I said. "Hey.
I just noticed this.

220
00:15:27.839 --> 00:15:29.972
We need to make sure that we're
communicating with Capitol.

221
00:15:30.059 --> 00:15:31.713
that this is coming their way."

222
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:32.932
Fuck Antifa!

223
00:15:33.019 --> 00:15:34.237
Fuck Antifa!

224
00:15:34.324 --> 00:15:35.586
Fuck Antifa!

225
00:15:41.549 --> 00:15:43.246
I said let me go see
how many people are really

226
00:15:43.333 --> 00:15:44.726
at this damn thing.

227
00:15:46.293 --> 00:15:51.385
Got all the way up. went up
this riser and then it was like.

228
00:15:51.472 --> 00:15:53.300
holy shit.

229
00:15:53.387 --> 00:15:55.867
This is thousands of people.

230
00:15:56.346 --> 00:15:57.913
Thousands.

231
00:15:58.131 --> 00:16:00.611
When I saw that.
I was like. goddamn.

232
00:16:00.698 --> 00:16:05.094
There's definitely going to be
some agitators

233
00:16:05.181 --> 00:16:07.575
amongst a crowd
of this size.

234
00:16:07.662 --> 00:16:10.926
Trump! Trump! Trump!

235
00:16:11.013 --> 00:16:13.146
Whooooo!

236
00:16:26.724 --> 00:16:29.249
The media will not show
the magnitude of this crowd.

237
00:16:30.554 --> 00:16:33.862
These people are not going
to take it any longer.

238
00:16:33.949 --> 00:16:37.387
They're not going to
take it any longer.

239
00:16:37.474 --> 00:16:40.738
I just really want to
see what they do.

240
00:16:40.825 --> 00:16:42.044
I just want to see
how they cover it.

241
00:16:42.131 --> 00:16:44.003
I've never seen
anything like it.

242
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:46.396
It'd be really great if we...

243
00:16:47.441 --> 00:16:49.269
Take this now?
Yep.

244
00:16:55.057 --> 00:16:56.493
See ya. Mom!

245
00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.147
Bye-bye. have a good day.

246
00:16:58.234 --> 00:16:59.279
You too.

247
00:17:05.198 --> 00:17:07.852
That day. I was so excited

248
00:17:07.939 --> 00:17:11.421
for this certification
of these votes.

249
00:17:11.508 --> 00:17:16.600
I had never experienced
that. and so I drove to work

250
00:17:16.687 --> 00:17:20.256
really excited.
I got all dressed up.

251
00:17:20.343 --> 00:17:24.826
I've always worked in spaces
that are meant to advocate

252
00:17:24.913 --> 00:17:27.263
or uplift the Black community.

253
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:31.920
And when Donald Trump
became president. it was.

254
00:17:32.007 --> 00:17:34.705
it was a challenging time.
to say the least.

255
00:17:34.792 --> 00:17:37.491
Um. so it felt like it
was a new day. you know?

256
00:17:37.578 --> 00:17:41.930
Joe Biden campaigned
on a message of unity.

257
00:17:42.017 --> 00:17:44.846
and it was something that
we had not heard in a few years.

258
00:17:44.933 --> 00:17:47.631
so I was really.
really. really excited

259
00:17:47.718 --> 00:17:50.547
to see what the future
held.

260
00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:01.558
I remember driving
down North Capitol Street.

261
00:18:01.645 --> 00:18:05.432
passing Lincoln's cottage
and the Rock Creek Cemetery.

262
00:18:05.519 --> 00:18:08.174
which is acres of tombstones.

263
00:18:09.827 --> 00:18:13.309
My whole life. I've thought
a lot about Abraham Lincoln.

264
00:18:13.396 --> 00:18:16.573
That day. I thought
about Lincoln

265
00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:20.360
losing his son in 1862

266
00:18:20.447 --> 00:18:23.145
near the beginning
of the Civil War.

267
00:18:23.232 --> 00:18:27.454
and not being able to properly
grieve for his son

268
00:18:27.541 --> 00:18:29.804
and being pulled
immediately into all of

269
00:18:29.891 --> 00:18:34.287
the military
planning and everything.

270
00:18:34.374 --> 00:18:36.027
I want to thank
all of you for coming

271
00:18:36.115 --> 00:18:39.988
and sharing our grief.

272
00:18:40.075 --> 00:18:44.166
Sharing our joy also.
about the life of Tommy.

273
00:18:46.037 --> 00:18:48.257
I've lost something
so fundamental.

274
00:18:48.344 --> 00:18:52.174
so elemental in my life
I am not sure at times

275
00:18:52.261 --> 00:18:54.263
that I even
recognize the world.

276
00:18:59.964 --> 00:19:06.406
Uh. my son Tommy had taken
his life on December 31st. 2020.

277
00:19:06.493 --> 00:19:08.756
um. after...

278
00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:11.541
um...

279
00:19:11.628 --> 00:19:15.066
a long seesaw battle
with depression.

280
00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:32.127
This was obviously
an overwhelming trauma

281
00:19:32.214 --> 00:19:35.565
and catastrophe
in the life of our family.

282
00:19:38.916 --> 00:19:43.094
We had his graveside service.
on January 5th.

283
00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:46.707
The next day.
January 6th...

284
00:19:47.969 --> 00:19:50.711
was the day
constitutionally assigned for

285
00:19:50.798 --> 00:19:52.626
Congress to meet
in joint session

286
00:19:52.713 --> 00:19:55.063
to receive
the Electoral College votes.

287
00:19:56.804 --> 00:19:58.893
The Speaker called to ask if
I could come in.

288
00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:00.808
and I told her
that I could come

289
00:20:00.895 --> 00:20:05.595
because the Democrats
had an extremely
narrow majority.

290
00:20:05.682 --> 00:20:08.381
and of course I was miserable

291
00:20:08.468 --> 00:20:14.082
and I was grieving. but the
truth is that I knew that Tommy

292
00:20:15.823 --> 00:20:18.042
would be in my heart.
he would be in my chest.

293
00:20:18.129 --> 00:20:20.088
I felt him there
from the beginning.

294
00:20:20.175 --> 00:20:24.135
and I knew that he would
want me to be hanging tough.

295
00:20:25.398 --> 00:20:28.270
That became
a governing logic for me

296
00:20:28.357 --> 00:20:30.403
in everything
that was to come.

297
00:20:37.497 --> 00:20:40.239
Our youngest daughter. Tabitha.
decided to come with me.

298
00:20:42.023 --> 00:20:44.330
and so did my son-in-law. Hank.

299
00:20:44.417 --> 00:20:46.201
who's married
to our daughter Hannah.

300
00:20:49.726 --> 00:20:51.946
We looked out the window and
we could see these streams

301
00:20:52.033 --> 00:20:55.036
of protestors coming
towards the Capitol.

302
00:20:56.211 --> 00:20:58.344
I just had never
seen that before.

303
00:20:58.431 --> 00:20:59.736
Where's Antifa?

304
00:20:59.823 --> 00:21:01.042
Where's Antifa?

305
00:21:01.129 --> 00:21:02.391
Where's Antifa?

306
00:21:08.745 --> 00:21:13.707
My assumption
was that the Capitol police
were well prepared.

307
00:21:13.794 --> 00:21:16.275
much like the Metropolitan
Police Department.

308
00:21:16.362 --> 00:21:19.930
What I saw
that was concerning to me

309
00:21:20.017 --> 00:21:21.758
is that there were not
very many

310
00:21:21.845 --> 00:21:25.632
Capitol police officers there
at the. at the bike rack.

311
00:21:25.719 --> 00:21:28.069
And this was really the first
point where they

312
00:21:28.156 --> 00:21:30.245
had to confront
some of the protestors.

313
00:21:33.901 --> 00:21:36.469
And I'm not exactly sure
strategically

314
00:21:36.556 --> 00:21:38.558
why they were
deployed that way.

315
00:21:38.645 --> 00:21:42.953
USA. USA. USA. USA.

316
00:21:55.444 --> 00:21:58.012
They breached the area here.

317
00:21:58.099 --> 00:21:59.100
Holy shit. guys.

318
00:22:03.539 --> 00:22:04.671
Holy shit. holy shit.

319
00:22:12.635 --> 00:22:13.680
Let's go!!

320
00:22:18.685 --> 00:22:20.948
If that had been defended
differently. you know--

321
00:22:21.035 --> 00:22:23.080
I can Monday-morning
quarterback it. but you know.

322
00:22:23.342 --> 00:22:25.474
what if there were
enough people there

323
00:22:25.561 --> 00:22:27.520
when that initial group
came there?

324
00:22:27.607 --> 00:22:29.478
You know. would things
have been different?

325
00:22:36.006 --> 00:22:38.444
We looked out the
window and Tabitha said.

326
00:22:38.531 --> 00:22:40.968
"Are the police gonna be able
to stop all these people?"

327
00:22:41.055 --> 00:22:44.711
And I said. "Yeah. it'll
be safe. it's the Capitol."

328
00:22:46.713 --> 00:22:49.803
We saw the protestors were
getting closer to the building.

329
00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:53.328
but I didn't take it seriously
because I thought the Capitol

330
00:22:53.415 --> 00:22:55.765
was one of the safest
buildings in the world.

331
00:22:55.852 --> 00:22:57.811
This is our house!

332
00:22:57.898 --> 00:23:00.683
We had been hearing chatter
of a potential protest.

333
00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:03.643
but that wasn't
out of the ordinary.

334
00:23:04.165 --> 00:23:06.515
so I just figured. you know.
that's what comes with
the territory of the day.

335
00:23:09.126 --> 00:23:12.347
USA! USA!

336
00:23:12.434 --> 00:23:14.610
I did
feel more nervous about it.

337
00:23:14.697 --> 00:23:17.352
but the Capitol police
felt like they were ready.
they were on top of it.

338
00:23:17.439 --> 00:23:20.747
so I gave Tabitha
and Hank a kiss goodbye.

339
00:23:20.834 --> 00:23:22.923
I said. "I'll see you out
at the floor." you know.

340
00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:25.969
"I'll be able to look up
at you in the gallery."

341
00:23:26.056 --> 00:23:27.928
<i>Rhonda. we're also seeing
Senators gather</i>

342
00:23:28.015 --> 00:23:32.062
<i>and prepare to
walk over to the House Chamber.</i>

343
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:34.325
We were preparing for there
to be a convening

344
00:23:34.413 --> 00:23:37.154
of the full body of Congress
to certify these votes.

345
00:23:37.241 --> 00:23:40.027
I was really excited
just. just to be there.

346
00:23:40.114 --> 00:23:43.204
And I remember House Majority
Whip Jim Clyburn

347
00:23:43.291 --> 00:23:45.946
doing his various press
interviews and taking
kind of a selfie

348
00:23:46.033 --> 00:23:49.906
of myself with the
Congressman. as I do.

349
00:23:53.649 --> 00:23:56.913
I was recording the Senators
walking over

350
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.439
and posting it to Instagram. and
I think I said something like.

351
00:24:00.526 --> 00:24:03.006
"Let the certification begin."
or something cheesy like that.

352
00:24:06.053 --> 00:24:07.750
Madam Speaker.
members of Congress.

353
00:24:07.837 --> 00:24:11.362
pursuant to the Constitution and
the laws of the United States...

354
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.409
On the House floor.
they passed out the memo

355
00:24:14.496 --> 00:24:16.716
from Vice President Pence

356
00:24:16.803 --> 00:24:18.805
saying that he was not going

357
00:24:18.892 --> 00:24:22.025
to assert unilateral powers

358
00:24:22.112 --> 00:24:25.551
to reject Electoral College
votes from the states.

359
00:24:25.638 --> 00:24:27.248
That memo told you precisely

360
00:24:27.335 --> 00:24:29.206
what Trump was trying
to get him to do.

361
00:24:29.293 --> 00:24:30.904
and he explained
why he couldn't do it

362
00:24:30.991 --> 00:24:34.168
and why it was not consistent
with the Constitution.

363
00:24:34.255 --> 00:24:36.823
So. I breathed a sigh of relief
because that was good news.

364
00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:38.912
After ascertainment
has been had

365
00:24:38.999 --> 00:24:42.872
that the certificates are
authentic and correct in form.

366
00:24:42.959 --> 00:24:45.484
the tellers will count and
make a list of the votes...

367
00:24:45.571 --> 00:24:47.442
A lot of us went into the
Congressman's office because

368
00:24:47.529 --> 00:24:49.662
the Congressman was
on the House floor

369
00:24:49.749 --> 00:24:52.142
dealing with
the certification by then.

370
00:24:52.229 --> 00:24:54.449
Outside of the Congressmen's
window.

371
00:24:54.536 --> 00:24:58.322
we could see the protestors
were getting closer.

372
00:24:58.409 --> 00:25:01.238
and it just seemed like they
were getting closer and closer.

373
00:25:03.719 --> 00:25:06.592
But even then. I was just like.
"That's closer than usual.

374
00:25:06.679 --> 00:25:08.289
but you know.
Capitol police will be fine."

375
00:25:13.947 --> 00:25:15.296
Our house!

376
00:25:16.689 --> 00:25:18.908
USA! USA!

377
00:25:18.995 --> 00:25:22.912
USA! USA! USA!

378
00:25:22.999 --> 00:25:25.045
USA! USA!

379
00:25:25.132 --> 00:25:26.525
Let's go. let's go.

380
00:25:35.359 --> 00:25:39.581
While that
first wave of people breached
the West Side of the Capitol.

381
00:25:39.668 --> 00:25:43.411
we get the call that
we have a suspicious package.

382
00:25:43.498 --> 00:25:47.981
one at the RNC. another
suspicious package at the DNC.

383
00:25:48.068 --> 00:25:50.723
And these things turned out
to be. like. real pipe bombs.

384
00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:53.595
We the people!
We the people!

385
00:25:53.682 --> 00:25:55.554
And almost simultaneously.

386
00:25:55.641 --> 00:25:59.253
we also get the call
as the Metropolitan
Police Department

387
00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:02.604
to come in to assist with
what's going on at the Capitol.

388
00:26:08.479 --> 00:26:11.744
And this is local law
enforcement coming to the aid
of the federal government.

389
00:26:11.831 --> 00:26:13.397
We don't do that in the
Metropolitan Police Department.

390
00:26:13.484 --> 00:26:15.704
It's not our area
of responsibility.

391
00:26:24.321 --> 00:26:25.758
We were broken up
into three squads.

392
00:26:25.845 --> 00:26:27.890
and I remember we're getting
ready for the day.

393
00:26:27.977 --> 00:26:29.588
and we're like it's just
going to be a normal day.

394
00:26:29.675 --> 00:26:31.459
you know they just needed
more manpower just in case.

395
00:26:31.546 --> 00:26:34.462
And within seconds.
the radio goes off.

396
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:37.334
And everything just changed.

397
00:26:37.421 --> 00:26:40.511
The mood that we were just in
30 seconds ago was. was gone.

398
00:26:40.599 --> 00:26:47.040
USA! USA! USA! USA!

399
00:26:47.127 --> 00:26:49.782
The scene was so chaotic
on the West front of the Capitol

400
00:26:49.869 --> 00:26:52.001
that the US Capitol police

401
00:26:52.088 --> 00:26:54.700
requested the services
of the National Guard.

402
00:27:06.363 --> 00:27:08.801
Every minute was precious.
as far as I'm concerned.

403
00:27:08.888 --> 00:27:10.541
We got what's happening
at the Capitol.

404
00:27:10.629 --> 00:27:13.719
We got pipe bombs at the RNC
and DNC-- real pipe bombs.

405
00:27:13.806 --> 00:27:16.504
We got members deployed there.
and we still have this

406
00:27:16.591 --> 00:27:19.420
large group of people that
have not even stepped off

407
00:27:19.507 --> 00:27:22.205
from the Ellipse to make
their way towards the Capitol.

408
00:27:22.292 --> 00:27:25.469
Right here. we're going
to walk down to the Capitol!

409
00:27:31.475 --> 00:27:34.914
The kind of pride and boldness
that they need

410
00:27:35.001 --> 00:27:36.655
to take back our country.

411
00:27:36.742 --> 00:27:40.310
So. let's walk down
Pennsylvania Avenue.

412
00:27:40.397 --> 00:27:41.921
I want to thank you all.

413
00:27:42.008 --> 00:27:45.620
God bless you
and God bless America.

414
00:27:45.707 --> 00:27:47.056
Thank you all for being here.

415
00:27:47.143 --> 00:27:48.884
This is incredible.
Thank you very much.

416
00:27:48.971 --> 00:27:52.061
Whooooo!

417
00:27:52.148 --> 00:27:55.978
1776! 1776!

418
00:27:56.065 --> 00:27:58.198
After the President finished
his speech.

419
00:27:58.285 --> 00:27:59.765
there was just like. you know.

420
00:27:59.852 --> 00:28:02.942
wave after wave
after wave of people.

421
00:28:03.029 --> 00:28:05.945
who didn't even have a barricade
to walk by at this point.

422
00:28:06.032 --> 00:28:07.642
I mean. it's just a mob
of people.

423
00:28:11.298 --> 00:28:13.039
On the way to the Capitol
building--

424
00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:23.179
- Whose flag?
- Our flag!

425
00:28:23.266 --> 00:28:25.399
Whose streets?
Our streets!

426
00:28:25.921 --> 00:28:27.444
- Yeah!
- God Bless America. baby!

427
00:28:27.531 --> 00:28:28.489
MEL
How you feeling. Nate?

428
00:28:29.272 --> 00:28:31.492
Oh. I'm feeling ready.
bro. Readier than ever.

429
00:28:33.537 --> 00:28:34.887
They're
evacuating the building.

430
00:28:34.974 --> 00:28:37.063
Occupy the Capitol.
Our building.

431
00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:38.194
They're
evacuating the building.

432
00:28:38.281 --> 00:28:39.282
Nobody else's building.

433
00:28:39.369 --> 00:28:40.457
It's ours...

434
00:28:40.544 --> 00:28:43.156
<i>♪ ...marching on ♪</i>

435
00:28:43.243 --> 00:28:45.941
<i>♪ Glory. glory hallelujah ♪</i>

436
00:28:46.028 --> 00:28:50.554
Then. once I got to the Capitol.
the "oh shit" moment

437
00:28:50.641 --> 00:28:53.601
really happened
where you're like. fuck!

438
00:28:53.688 --> 00:28:54.820
We live for freedom!

439
00:28:56.604 --> 00:28:58.084
Come see it.

440
00:28:58.171 --> 00:28:59.259
Come see these people
take this house back.

441
00:28:59.346 --> 00:29:00.564
Come see it.

442
00:29:02.436 --> 00:29:07.136
This looks like some shit
out of a crazy-ass movie set.

443
00:29:07.223 --> 00:29:08.790
This is democracy!

444
00:29:09.051 --> 00:29:11.532
This is what you get
with rule of the mob!

445
00:29:11.924 --> 00:29:14.709
I get up to this structure.
and I just hear people saying.

446
00:29:14.796 --> 00:29:16.580
"Everyone gotta get off.
it's too many people.

447
00:29:16.667 --> 00:29:18.060
this is gonna collapse."

448
00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.498
Stop the steal!

449
00:29:25.764 --> 00:29:27.504
Where are people gonna go?

450
00:29:27.591 --> 00:29:29.637
Are people actually gonna
go in the fucking building?

451
00:29:29.724 --> 00:29:31.204
Like what the hell is happening?

452
00:29:31.291 --> 00:29:32.509
Where are the police?

453
00:29:32.596 --> 00:29:34.207
We want Trump!

454
00:29:34.294 --> 00:29:35.991
We want Trump!

455
00:29:36.078 --> 00:29:37.514
We're at the gate.
we're coming through

456
00:29:37.601 --> 00:29:39.081
this motherfucker tonight.

457
00:29:39.168 --> 00:29:40.387
We're at the door.

458
00:29:40.474 --> 00:29:42.171
We're right here.
we're coming in.

459
00:29:42.258 --> 00:29:43.999
We're not stopping. goddamnit!

460
00:29:44.478 --> 00:29:46.436
This is our house
motherfuckers!

461
00:29:47.002 --> 00:29:48.047
USA!

462
00:29:55.445 --> 00:29:57.534
DC 42.
disregard Constitution.

463
00:29:57.621 --> 00:29:59.667
...will respond over there.

464
00:29:59.754 --> 00:30:01.538
We received the order
to go to the Capitol.

465
00:30:01.625 --> 00:30:03.845
and we were putting on our gear
when eventually our sergeant

466
00:30:03.932 --> 00:30:06.369
said. "All right. that's enough.
whatever you got on
is gonna be it.

467
00:30:06.456 --> 00:30:07.936
It's time to move."

468
00:30:08.023 --> 00:30:10.634
So. we all got in the van
and started driving.

469
00:30:19.948 --> 00:30:22.908
I was racing faster than
I've ever driven a police car

470
00:30:22.995 --> 00:30:24.170
in my life to get down there.

471
00:30:27.129 --> 00:30:29.305
When we got out of the car.
there were thousands

472
00:30:29.392 --> 00:30:30.437
and thousands of people.

473
00:30:34.571 --> 00:30:36.660
There was no orders
at that point.

474
00:30:36.747 --> 00:30:39.576
There was too much going on
to have any type of orders.

475
00:30:39.663 --> 00:30:41.665
and I did not think that
we were going to be able

476
00:30:41.752 --> 00:30:43.363
to get through the crowd.

477
00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:44.625
I didn't think they would
allow us to get through.

478
00:30:54.896 --> 00:30:57.029
This is our 1776.

479
00:30:57.116 --> 00:30:59.988
We need to continue
to storm this Capitol.

480
00:31:00.075 --> 00:31:03.209
Do not let police through.
they are traitors.

481
00:31:23.925 --> 00:31:25.100
There were so many people.

482
00:31:28.408 --> 00:31:29.931
They had us comically
outnumbered.

483
00:31:32.238 --> 00:31:34.240
One guy asked me.
"Are you my brother?"

484
00:31:34.327 --> 00:31:36.633
It took me a second to process
what he was asking me.

485
00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.680
"Do you actually think
I want to overthrow
the government with you?"

486
00:31:42.596 --> 00:31:45.294
If it was just the couple
hundred that committed

487
00:31:45.381 --> 00:31:48.254
the extreme acts of violence.
we coulda handled that.

488
00:31:48.341 --> 00:31:51.170
It's the thousands and thousands
of people backing them up.

489
00:31:54.608 --> 00:31:56.001
It was the crowd
that was the weapon.

490
00:32:00.962 --> 00:32:03.834
I'm seeing objects
being flown at us.

491
00:32:03.922 --> 00:32:05.184
screaming at other
officers to duck

492
00:32:05.271 --> 00:32:06.837
because they're about
to get hit with a brick.

493
00:32:12.452 --> 00:32:13.975
They started attacking us.

494
00:32:14.062 --> 00:32:15.846
One guy tried to grab my baton.

495
00:32:15.934 --> 00:32:17.936
I was taking blows
from all sides.

496
00:32:18.023 --> 00:32:20.503
I felt something heavy
come down into my head.

497
00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:22.679
Eventually I went to the ground.

498
00:32:24.768 --> 00:32:28.120
and the guy I was wrestling with
kicked me in the chest.

499
00:32:30.905 --> 00:32:32.907
The medical mask I was wearing
at the time had actually

500
00:32:32.994 --> 00:32:36.215
gotten pulled up over my eyes.
so when I was on the ground

501
00:32:36.302 --> 00:32:39.740
on all fours I was also blind.
and I was afraid I was just

502
00:32:39.827 --> 00:32:41.524
about to get dogpiled
and destroyed.

503
00:32:50.272 --> 00:32:53.623
I lost my radio. my baton.

504
00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:58.889
uh. I can't remember now. but
a few other pieces of equipment.

505
00:32:58.977 --> 00:33:00.979
You couldn't defend yourself
and your gear at the same time.

506
00:33:01.066 --> 00:33:02.502
so you just had to let it go.

507
00:33:07.246 --> 00:33:10.901
When I. thankfully
got back up on my feet.

508
00:33:10.989 --> 00:33:12.468
I led my platoon
through the crowd

509
00:33:12.555 --> 00:33:14.949
until we got to
the terrace proper.

510
00:33:15.036 --> 00:33:17.734
and we joined Capitol police
and the rest of MPD there.

511
00:33:21.434 --> 00:33:23.262
You couldn't get any closer
to the Capitol at that point

512
00:33:23.349 --> 00:33:25.264
without going inside. honestly.

513
00:33:25.351 --> 00:33:28.180
So. I knew at that point
that it was imperative

514
00:33:28.267 --> 00:33:29.529
that we keep them out.

515
00:33:33.576 --> 00:33:35.361
Fuck you!

516
00:33:35.448 --> 00:33:36.449
Fuck you!

517
00:33:38.277 --> 00:33:41.410
You're a fucking scumbag!
Scumbag!

518
00:33:41.497 --> 00:33:43.543
You're all fucking scumbags!

519
00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:46.372
You swore a fucking
oath to this country!

520
00:33:46.459 --> 00:33:48.635
That's me right there.

521
00:33:48.722 --> 00:33:51.594
Once I got to the Capitol.
as I walk down the steps

522
00:33:51.681 --> 00:33:53.683
to the West Front.
on this white marble

523
00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:57.035
you're seeing police officers'
gear. blood.

524
00:33:57.122 --> 00:34:00.255
anything and everything that you
can think of that would happen

525
00:34:00.342 --> 00:34:03.258
in a fight. it was happening
right there on the West Front.

526
00:34:09.743 --> 00:34:13.399
Well. fuck you guys! You
can't call yourselves Americans!

527
00:34:13.486 --> 00:34:16.315
You broke your fucking
oath today!

528
00:34:16.402 --> 00:34:18.534
1776. man!

529
00:34:22.756 --> 00:34:25.628
When we go through our training.
we are required to get sprayed

530
00:34:25.715 --> 00:34:29.197
with OC. which is pepper spray.
so we know how we react.

531
00:34:29.284 --> 00:34:30.807
we know how our body reacts.

532
00:34:30.894 --> 00:34:32.635
It was not fun.

533
00:34:32.722 --> 00:34:35.073
It lasts for about 45 minutes
before you can see again.

534
00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:36.770
you feel better again.

535
00:34:36.857 --> 00:34:38.337
Bear mace--

536
00:34:38.424 --> 00:34:43.124
compared to that.
OC is. like. on level 10.

537
00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:45.170
I was just blinded.

538
00:34:47.128 --> 00:34:48.434
You okay?

539
00:34:48.521 --> 00:34:49.739
I just can't open my eyes.

540
00:34:49.826 --> 00:34:51.089
Okay. need some more water?

541
00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:54.962
Oh. my God.

542
00:34:55.049 --> 00:34:56.398
I know. You're blinded. right?

543
00:34:58.096 --> 00:35:00.010
They're throwing shit.
so I'm just going to put this
on top of your head.

544
00:35:00.098 --> 00:35:01.490
Alright.

545
00:35:01.577 --> 00:35:02.839
Just in case.
Alright.

546
00:35:02.926 --> 00:35:04.493
I don't want you to get hit.

547
00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:06.495
You're just hopeless
and helpless at that point.

548
00:35:07.888 --> 00:35:09.063
Can I get more water?
Yeah.

549
00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:35.872
I'm representing our president.

550
00:35:35.959 --> 00:35:37.613
He won this election.

551
00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:40.486
This was stolen from us.
and a million people

552
00:35:40.573 --> 00:35:42.270
are standing in front of
the Capitol. and we know it.

553
00:35:47.362 --> 00:35:49.321
Are there any objections
to counting the certificate

554
00:35:49.408 --> 00:35:51.453
of vote from the state
of Arizona?

555
00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:54.630
We began the counting of
Electoral College votes.

556
00:35:54.935 --> 00:35:57.416
and Arizona was the first one
where there were objections.

557
00:35:58.025 --> 00:36:00.854
Is the objection in writing
and signed by a Senator?

558
00:36:00.941 --> 00:36:02.943
- Yes. it is.
- It is.

559
00:36:05.293 --> 00:36:08.601
Something like 50 or 60
Republicans got up to object.

560
00:36:08.688 --> 00:36:11.995
And at that point. the joint
session immediately breaks.

561
00:36:12.082 --> 00:36:13.606
and the House and the Senate
resolve into

562
00:36:13.693 --> 00:36:17.523
our separate chambers
to debate the challenges.

563
00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:22.615
I look back up in the gallery
to see that Tabitha
and Hank were there.

564
00:36:22.702 --> 00:36:25.835
And then it was my turn
to get up.

565
00:36:25.922 --> 00:36:30.013
my basic point was going
to be that the election is over.

566
00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:33.713
It's not our job to vote for the
person we want to be President;

567
00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:39.588
it's our job to certify
the votes that have come in
from the governors.

568
00:36:39.675 --> 00:36:41.111
That's what the job is.

569
00:36:41.199 --> 00:36:43.984
But before getting into it.
I took a second

570
00:36:44.071 --> 00:36:47.379
just to thank the Speaker
and all of the Members

571
00:36:47.466 --> 00:36:50.556
for their condolences.

572
00:36:50.643 --> 00:36:53.776
The gentleman is recognized
without objection for five
minutes.

573
00:36:53.863 --> 00:36:55.865
Madam Speaker.
I wanna thank you first.

574
00:36:55.952 --> 00:36:58.781
and-- and all my dear. beloved
colleagues for your love

575
00:36:58.868 --> 00:37:00.261
and tenderness.
which my family

576
00:37:00.348 --> 00:37:02.655
and I will never forget.

577
00:37:02.742 --> 00:37:06.136
And then. there was this
huge standing ovation...

578
00:37:24.198 --> 00:37:26.592
It was jarring
and disorienting for me

579
00:37:26.679 --> 00:37:30.596
because I could kind of see

580
00:37:30.683 --> 00:37:35.122
them looking at me.

581
00:37:35.209 --> 00:37:37.907
or into me as

582
00:37:37.994 --> 00:37:42.303
a person embodying
tragedy at that point.

583
00:37:45.524 --> 00:37:48.353
It was really a lovely.
wonderful gesture.

584
00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:51.660
but I'm not sure
I totally understood it.

585
00:37:51.747 --> 00:37:57.753
But then I started thinking.
in my kind of sleepless.

586
00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:04.499
disjointed way. "Well. maybe
everyone's love of Tommy.

587
00:38:04.586 --> 00:38:08.329
or sympathy for our family.
would lead to an end

588
00:38:08.416 --> 00:38:11.201
of all of this fighting
over the election."

589
00:38:11.289 --> 00:38:14.857
Maybe they would withdraw
the Stop the Steal campaign.

590
00:38:14.944 --> 00:38:17.077
and they would stop
telling the Big Lie.

591
00:38:17.164 --> 00:38:20.123
It was obviously
a completely irrational thought.

592
00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:22.996
but that's what passed
through my mind right there.

593
00:38:23.083 --> 00:38:26.129
because there was this huge
outpouring of emotion

594
00:38:26.216 --> 00:38:27.261
in this standing ovation.

595
00:38:30.177 --> 00:38:33.223
And then it was
over. and then I launched
into my real speech.

596
00:38:33.311 --> 00:38:35.443
Thank you again.

597
00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:40.579
Abraham Lincoln. whose name
is a comfort to us all.

598
00:38:40.666 --> 00:38:42.320
said we've got
the best government...

599
00:38:42.407 --> 00:38:44.931
So still at that
point. we had no reason to think

600
00:38:45.018 --> 00:38:50.240
that there was medieval-style
fighting breaking out outside.

601
00:38:50.328 --> 00:38:53.461
We were ready in the way
you'd be ready in a courtroom

602
00:38:53.548 --> 00:38:56.856
or a classroom.
but we weren't ready

603
00:38:56.943 --> 00:39:00.599
in the way we
should've been for
what was about to take place.

604
00:39:06.344 --> 00:39:08.737
Take their guns!
Take their guns!

605
00:39:18.051 --> 00:39:19.269
Robert Glover.
who's now the Commander

606
00:39:19.705 --> 00:39:21.881
of our Special
Operations Division.

607
00:39:21.968 --> 00:39:24.710
I heard some things in his voice
that I've never heard before.

608
00:39:24.797 --> 00:39:26.233
Pull them! Pull them this way!

609
00:39:37.418 --> 00:39:38.593
Commander Glover. you know.

610
00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:40.334
he knew that we were
losing ground.

611
00:39:40.421 --> 00:39:41.770
and he had no problem
letting us know.

612
00:39:41.857 --> 00:39:43.772
"We're losing ground.
we need to back up."

613
00:39:43.859 --> 00:39:45.339
Because we were outnumbered.

614
00:39:45.426 --> 00:39:47.515
We were outnumbered.

615
00:39:47.602 --> 00:39:51.476
It was such a wide line of
people going back for--

616
00:39:51.563 --> 00:39:53.303
this is an exaggeration.
but for miles--

617
00:39:53.391 --> 00:39:55.262
you know. that's how it felt.

618
00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:57.656
What are you going to do
when we defend our Constitution

619
00:39:57.743 --> 00:39:58.744
with the Second Amendment?

620
00:39:58.831 --> 00:40:01.442
What are you going to do then?

621
00:40:23.986 --> 00:40:26.162
<i>All people must leave
the area immediately.</i>

622
00:40:26.249 --> 00:40:29.818
<i>If you don't follow this order.
it may subject you to arrest.</i>

623
00:40:29.905 --> 00:40:33.169
These police officers were
completely overwhelmed by

624
00:40:33.256 --> 00:40:35.955
the thousands of people that
were next to me. behind me.

625
00:40:36.042 --> 00:40:37.783
around me.

626
00:40:41.003 --> 00:40:43.223
There were definitely
ex-military personnel.

627
00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:45.051
Ex-police.

628
00:40:45.138 --> 00:40:46.835
There were people that
knew what they were doing.

629
00:40:46.922 --> 00:40:50.491
knew how to lead people.
and if I step back.

630
00:40:50.578 --> 00:40:54.016
I can start hearing
people say that. you know.

631
00:40:54.103 --> 00:40:55.583
they are going in.

632
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:58.281
This is. you know.
"We are going to go inside.

633
00:40:58.368 --> 00:41:02.547
Donald Trump is meeting us here.
and if you don't let us in.

634
00:41:02.634 --> 00:41:04.679
we're going
to fuck some shit up."

635
00:41:04.766 --> 00:41:07.856
Right now.
the people in the Capitol
are sheltering in place.

636
00:41:07.943 --> 00:41:09.336
We have the Capitol.

637
00:41:11.512 --> 00:41:13.688
There's just
so much that's going on.

638
00:41:13.775 --> 00:41:16.909
And from a command standpoint--
a Chief of Police standpoint--

639
00:41:16.996 --> 00:41:19.607
I need to be in a position
where I can command

640
00:41:19.694 --> 00:41:21.261
what's happening
for the entire city.

641
00:41:21.348 --> 00:41:23.437
and the mayor needs to know

642
00:41:23.524 --> 00:41:25.787
exactly what's going on
at that point.

643
00:41:25.874 --> 00:41:28.703
And I told her that I would
meet her at our command center.

644
00:41:35.318 --> 00:41:37.973
Now I have a view of what's
happening at the Capitol.

645
00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:39.845
I have a view of what's
happening at the Ellipse.

646
00:41:39.932 --> 00:41:42.325
I have a view of what's
happening at Freedom Plaza.

647
00:41:42.412 --> 00:41:43.892
I was sending
everything that I had

648
00:41:43.979 --> 00:41:46.068
because our democracy
was under attack.

649
00:41:46.155 --> 00:41:50.203
What we really needed to see
were National Guardsmen

650
00:41:50.290 --> 00:41:51.509
at the US Capitol.

651
00:42:00.474 --> 00:42:02.432
At that point.
we had a phone call

652
00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.434
that was convened by myself.

653
00:42:04.522 --> 00:42:05.914
by the Mayor of the District
of Columbia.

654
00:42:06.567 --> 00:42:09.178
several representatives
of the DC National Guard.

655
00:42:09.265 --> 00:42:12.181
the US Capitol Police Chief.
where he essentially was

656
00:42:12.268 --> 00:42:15.271
pleading for assistance
from the National Guard.

657
00:42:15.358 --> 00:42:17.360
I just simply said.
"Wait a minute.

658
00:42:17.447 --> 00:42:21.190
What I hear is the Chief
of the Capitol Police

659
00:42:21.277 --> 00:42:23.932
asking for additional resources
from the National Guard

660
00:42:24.019 --> 00:42:26.979
to be deployed
to the US Capitol.

661
00:42:27.066 --> 00:42:28.720
Chief. is that
what you're saying?'

662
00:42:28.807 --> 00:42:30.722
This is on a bridge call.

663
00:42:30.809 --> 00:42:32.550
He said. "That is exactly
what I'm saying."

664
00:42:32.637 --> 00:42:34.334
Chief Sund said that.

665
00:42:34.421 --> 00:42:38.338
In response to that.
whoever on the other side.

666
00:42:38.425 --> 00:42:42.603
from the representatives
from the Defense Department.

667
00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:46.999
the discussion then switched
to talking about optics.

668
00:42:47.086 --> 00:42:49.349
and boots on the ground.
and what that would look like.

669
00:42:49.436 --> 00:42:52.178
which. you know.
in a crisis situation.

670
00:42:52.265 --> 00:42:55.181
I don't care what it looks like.
It looks like help to me.

671
00:43:11.066 --> 00:43:13.982
So. I asked all who
were on this call.

672
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:16.811
"Are you saying that you're
not going to deploy personnel?"

673
00:43:16.898 --> 00:43:19.858
"No. we're not saying that.
what we are saying is that

674
00:43:19.945 --> 00:43:21.773
optics. and this and that
and so forth."

675
00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:23.296
It was very disturbing.

676
00:43:53.543 --> 00:43:57.635
This is a bad situation.
we have to do the best we can

677
00:43:57.722 --> 00:44:01.160
to defend this Capitol.
to defend our democracy

678
00:44:01.247 --> 00:44:02.422
with everything that we got.

679
00:44:08.167 --> 00:44:11.257
Apparently. the National
Guard were blocks away.

680
00:44:11.736 --> 00:44:14.608
That makes me mad.
because I don't even know-

681
00:44:14.695 --> 00:44:18.786
I don't even wanna know
how many officers were there

682
00:44:18.873 --> 00:44:20.135
that could have helped us...

683
00:44:21.876 --> 00:44:23.748
I don't even wanna know.
because that will just

684
00:44:25.358 --> 00:44:26.664
blow me up.

685
00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:31.059
As someone who served six years
in the Virginia National Guard.

686
00:44:31.146 --> 00:44:34.149
I was aware of the National
Guard and how they could

687
00:44:34.236 --> 00:44:35.803
possibly respond.

688
00:44:35.890 --> 00:44:38.980
I also knew that they
take time to respond.

689
00:44:39.067 --> 00:44:42.201
I don't know why anyone
would've delayed that.

690
00:44:48.337 --> 00:44:52.254
My officers didn't know that
not only were they breaching

691
00:44:52.341 --> 00:44:56.041
the West Side of the Capitol.
the East Side of the Capitol

692
00:44:56.128 --> 00:44:57.695
was also being breached.

693
00:45:05.441 --> 00:45:09.010
USA! USA! USA!

694
00:45:18.237 --> 00:45:20.761
So. they had essentially
been surrounded.

695
00:45:26.245 --> 00:45:29.335
It just kept getting crazier
and crazier and crazier...

696
00:45:42.957 --> 00:45:44.611
We're taking it!

697
00:45:44.698 --> 00:45:46.004
We're storming the House!

698
00:45:50.443 --> 00:45:54.055
I was saying to people.
"Where are we going?
What are we doing?"

699
00:45:54.142 --> 00:45:57.885
It was a lot of. we. we.
we. we. we to comfort them.

700
00:45:57.972 --> 00:45:59.669
you know?

701
00:45:59.757 --> 00:46:02.847
And it's also a way to comfort
myself to like. you know.

702
00:46:02.934 --> 00:46:06.198
so I can feel safer to let
you know that I am not a threat.

703
00:46:06.285 --> 00:46:08.417
I have cameras.
but not a threat.

704
00:46:38.447 --> 00:46:39.797
It's gonna be a stampede.

705
00:46:40.275 --> 00:46:41.537
In my mind. I'm like. "I don't
know if I'm being dramatic.

706
00:46:41.624 --> 00:46:43.191
but this might turn
into a stampede."

707
00:46:43.278 --> 00:46:46.020
I don't know if we can
control this or contain it.

708
00:47:13.395 --> 00:47:18.966
I remember watching as police
officers were clearly exhausted.

709
00:47:19.053 --> 00:47:20.533
It started to look abnormal.

710
00:47:22.535 --> 00:47:24.972
And then there was like
a beeping in the office.

711
00:47:27.235 --> 00:47:29.150
I guess there's some sort of
security device in the office

712
00:47:29.237 --> 00:47:31.718
that I never knew existed.

713
00:47:31.805 --> 00:47:33.415
Then we started getting
directives from

714
00:47:33.502 --> 00:47:35.765
our chief of staff.
from the office manager.

715
00:47:35.853 --> 00:47:37.985
She told me to wear flats.

716
00:47:38.072 --> 00:47:39.682
and she told me
to pack up my bags.

717
00:47:54.132 --> 00:47:57.396
<i>Person outside has attempted
to enter on the Senate side</i>

718
00:47:57.483 --> 00:47:59.485
<i>of the building.</i>

719
00:47:59.572 --> 00:48:01.966
We had a television in the
office. we also had windows.

720
00:48:02.053 --> 00:48:04.446
so we could see that they
were clearly. you know.

721
00:48:04.533 --> 00:48:05.795
closing in on us.

722
00:48:11.105 --> 00:48:14.413
But despite the beeping.
despite huddling

723
00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:18.025
in the Congressman's office.
nothing made it real

724
00:48:18.112 --> 00:48:20.549
until those people
actually got inside.

725
00:48:33.432 --> 00:48:38.219
I first got a text from a
friend in California saying.

726
00:48:38.306 --> 00:48:39.829
"Are you okay?
Is everything alright?"

727
00:48:39.917 --> 00:48:42.136
And I said. "Yes.
what do you mean?"

728
00:48:42.223 --> 00:48:45.096
And she said. "There's
a breach in the Capitol.

729
00:48:45.183 --> 00:48:47.272
There's violence outside."

730
00:48:47.359 --> 00:48:49.317
And I looked around the room
and I noticed that

731
00:48:49.404 --> 00:48:51.972
lots of people
were getting messages

732
00:48:52.059 --> 00:48:53.756
and people
were beginning to talk.

733
00:49:06.856 --> 00:49:10.860
Within a couple of minutes.
Speaker Pelosi's security detail

734
00:49:10.948 --> 00:49:12.950
escorted her off of the floor.

735
00:49:25.484 --> 00:49:27.442
Some people on our side
of the aisle began to scream.

736
00:49:27.529 --> 00:49:30.402
"This is because of you.
this is what you wanted."

737
00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:35.581
I immediately looked back up
into the gallery.

738
00:49:35.668 --> 00:49:37.800
Tabitha and Hank
were no longer there.

739
00:50:05.785 --> 00:50:07.874
Oh. Nancy!

740
00:50:07.961 --> 00:50:09.832
Where are you. Nancy?

741
00:50:09.919 --> 00:50:12.966
Our office was right above
Nancy Pelosi's office.

742
00:50:13.053 --> 00:50:14.707
the Speaker of the House.

743
00:50:14.794 --> 00:50:17.797
Three of my colleagues went out.
and our staff assistant

744
00:50:17.884 --> 00:50:22.541
said she came
face to face with one of
the insurrectionists.

745
00:50:22.628 --> 00:50:25.065
We were in the room.
and she was banging on the door.

746
00:50:25.152 --> 00:50:26.458
and she said. "They're inside.

747
00:50:26.545 --> 00:50:28.416
They're inside. Let me in!"

748
00:50:28.503 --> 00:50:30.201
They were extremely rattled.

749
00:50:30.288 --> 00:50:32.072
And they said that we
needed to stay here.

750
00:50:32.159 --> 00:50:34.074
Like we cannot leave.

751
00:50:34.161 --> 00:50:36.511
That was. I think
the turning point for me.

752
00:50:42.039 --> 00:50:44.476
I called Julie.
my Chief of Staff.

753
00:50:44.563 --> 00:50:48.132
and she said they were
back in Steny's office.

754
00:50:49.307 --> 00:50:51.265
They had locked the door.

755
00:50:51.352 --> 00:50:54.703
She said they had pushed all the
furniture up against the door.

756
00:50:59.447 --> 00:51:03.190
The kids were hiding under.

757
00:51:03.277 --> 00:51:05.627
uh. a desk.

758
00:51:05.714 --> 00:51:10.284
And I learned later that Julie
had taken the-- the fire pick

759
00:51:10.371 --> 00:51:13.679
outta the fireplace and was
wielding it as-- as a weapon.

760
00:51:13.766 --> 00:51:16.247
And I told her to protect
them with her life.

761
00:51:19.119 --> 00:51:20.425
This is our fucking house.

762
00:51:20.512 --> 00:51:21.774
Our house.

763
00:51:28.824 --> 00:51:30.652
I heard the elevator open.

764
00:51:30.739 --> 00:51:32.915
and I heard them
come up the stairwell.

765
00:51:33.002 --> 00:51:35.570
and so we decided
to stay in place.

766
00:51:35.657 --> 00:51:39.313
turn the lights out and to
just be as quiet as possible

767
00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:41.010
and to barricade the doors.

768
00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:44.971
I had to assume the worst.

769
00:51:45.058 --> 00:51:47.147
I had to assume these
people were armed.

770
00:51:48.322 --> 00:51:49.889
You kind of go
into survival mode.

771
00:51:49.976 --> 00:51:52.370
like I remember essentially
casing the office. like.

772
00:51:52.457 --> 00:51:54.546
"What can I use as a weapon?"

773
00:51:54.633 --> 00:51:57.679
I remember feeling like

774
00:51:57.766 --> 00:52:02.380
whatever is in here that is
heavy is what I'll have to use.

775
00:52:02.467 --> 00:52:04.860
you know. if it comes to that.

776
00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:22.530
We want Trump! We want Trump!

777
00:52:27.274 --> 00:52:28.884
Fuck you.
you fuckin' tyrants!

778
00:52:34.890 --> 00:52:38.198
Whenever I see footage from that
day. it makes my heart race.

779
00:52:38.285 --> 00:52:40.113
You know. I can feel blood--
my blood pressure shoot up.

780
00:52:43.247 --> 00:52:46.598
and it makes me angry.

781
00:52:46.685 --> 00:52:49.166
Lay down your weapons!

782
00:52:49.253 --> 00:52:52.386
Those weapons belong to us!

783
00:52:52.473 --> 00:52:55.084
That helmet. 4-5-1-8.
belongs to me!

784
00:52:55.172 --> 00:52:59.263
Give me my helmet!
Give me my helmet!

785
00:52:59.350 --> 00:53:01.003
Now. Hodges!

786
00:53:01.090 --> 00:53:03.397
<i>D. Hodges.
lay down your weapons!</i>

787
00:53:03.484 --> 00:53:07.488
<i>4-5-1-8.
give me my helmet!</i>

788
00:53:07.575 --> 00:53:08.663
<i>I want my helmet!</i>

789
00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:10.926
Gimme my helmet!

790
00:53:11.013 --> 00:53:13.494
That helmet belongs to me!

791
00:53:13.581 --> 00:53:15.583
<i>I paid for that helmet!</i>

792
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:17.585
<i>I paid for that vest!</i>

793
00:53:17.672 --> 00:53:19.196
<i>I paid for your salary!</i>

794
00:53:19.283 --> 00:53:20.284
<i>Traitor!</i>

795
00:53:24.549 --> 00:53:26.812
You're a bunch of sheep. sheep!

796
00:53:26.899 --> 00:53:29.684
There was just sensory
overload of threats that.

797
00:53:29.771 --> 00:53:31.904
I'm scanning the crowd
rather than paying attention to

798
00:53:31.991 --> 00:53:34.211
what people are shouting at me
because I'm constantly looking

799
00:53:34.298 --> 00:53:36.430
for. uh. someone who's about
to bring out a gun or a knife

800
00:53:36.517 --> 00:53:39.128
or something because I know
that they have them on them.

801
00:53:39.216 --> 00:53:42.306
And I just have to hope
that if I see that I can
react before they do.

802
00:53:44.743 --> 00:53:47.441
At one point I look over my
shoulder and I see the officers

803
00:53:47.528 --> 00:53:50.052
trying to hold them back
and failing

804
00:53:50.139 --> 00:53:52.446
because their numbers
are overwhelming.

805
00:53:58.147 --> 00:54:02.064
At that point. I see
the line break. essentially.

806
00:54:13.946 --> 00:54:15.556
You better run. cops!

807
00:54:39.406 --> 00:54:41.539
Each officer just engages
in a pitched battle

808
00:54:41.626 --> 00:54:43.628
with whatever's
in front of them.

809
00:54:43.715 --> 00:54:46.326
People swinging things at our
heads-- sticks. metal poles.

810
00:54:52.550 --> 00:54:55.204
One Sergeant was hit
with a cattle prod.

811
00:54:56.423 --> 00:54:58.556
There was a sledgehammer.

812
00:54:58.643 --> 00:55:00.079
I had someone try
to gouge my eye out.

813
00:55:05.127 --> 00:55:07.826
These people like to believe
that they support blue lives.

814
00:55:07.913 --> 00:55:12.047
but someone came up to me
while I was surrounded and said.

815
00:55:12.134 --> 00:55:13.875
"Things are gonna get real bad.

816
00:55:13.962 --> 00:55:17.096
We need to get you out of here.
What can I do to help?"

817
00:55:17.183 --> 00:55:19.141
And I said. "Go home."

818
00:55:19.228 --> 00:55:20.926
And he said.
"Not gonna happen."

819
00:55:23.015 --> 00:55:25.365
And at that point.
there's not much left to say.

820
00:55:40.815 --> 00:55:41.903
Let's go. MPD
double time inside.

821
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:44.906
Let's go.
Let's go. MPD.

822
00:55:44.993 --> 00:55:46.734
Stop fucking looking
at them. let's go!

823
00:55:46.821 --> 00:55:49.258
Get inside.
Goddamn. let's get inside!

824
00:55:51.739 --> 00:55:54.829
To be honest.
I don't even remember
getting inside the Capitol.

825
00:55:54.916 --> 00:55:57.049
We were funneled into
the Capitol at some point.

826
00:56:00.139 --> 00:56:01.619
I don't know anything
about this building.

827
00:56:02.184 --> 00:56:04.273
I remember running up to Capitol
officers. and there was

828
00:56:04.361 --> 00:56:07.102
only a couple of 'em. I would
say. "How do I get here
and here?"

829
00:56:07.189 --> 00:56:09.540
"I don't know.
I don't work in this building."

830
00:56:35.479 --> 00:56:37.089
Our house! Whose house?

831
00:56:37.176 --> 00:56:38.960
Our house! Whose house?

832
00:56:39.047 --> 00:56:40.309
Our house! Whose house?

833
00:56:40.875 --> 00:56:42.442
Our house! Whose house?

834
00:56:42.529 --> 00:56:44.183
Our house! Whose house?

835
00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:45.663
Our house! Whose house?

836
00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:47.882
Our house! Whose house?

837
00:56:47.969 --> 00:56:51.190
There were two sets of doors
in the Congressman's office.

838
00:56:51.277 --> 00:56:52.887
so my colleagues
on the other side of the office

839
00:56:52.974 --> 00:56:56.761
barricaded one set.
we barricaded the other set.

840
00:56:59.503 --> 00:57:03.115
Um. and you know. there was
just a lot of. you know.

841
00:57:03.202 --> 00:57:05.639
I had a coworker who's
a really good friend of mine.

842
00:57:05.726 --> 00:57:08.425
and she was. you know.
very. very pregnant.

843
00:57:08.512 --> 00:57:09.904
So. you know.
she couldn't do it.

844
00:57:09.991 --> 00:57:13.995
Um. and we had
photographers in the room.

845
00:57:14.082 --> 00:57:16.171
Some of them were taking
pictures instead of helping.

846
00:57:16.258 --> 00:57:18.652
And I remember being really.
really annoyed with them

847
00:57:18.739 --> 00:57:20.959
at the time. 'cause
I was like. you know.

848
00:57:21.046 --> 00:57:22.482
"This is not the time
for your Pulitzer.

849
00:57:22.569 --> 00:57:24.876
Like. this is life or death."

850
00:57:24.963 --> 00:57:26.486
And I mean. in hindsight.
I guess it's.

851
00:57:26.573 --> 00:57:27.966
it's good that
it was documented.

852
00:57:28.053 --> 00:57:31.012
But in the moment.
we are possibly. you know.

853
00:57:31.099 --> 00:57:33.101
fighting for our lives.

854
00:57:33.188 --> 00:57:35.277
We don't know what's
on the other side of that door.

855
00:57:47.768 --> 00:57:51.032
I vividly remember
hearing someone say.

856
00:57:51.119 --> 00:57:53.557
"They're hiding from us."
and like kind of laughing.

857
00:57:53.644 --> 00:57:55.515
It felt as if they were like
taunting us. like. you know.

858
00:57:55.602 --> 00:57:57.343
"Hello. anybody in here?"

859
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:58.910
And they were just banging.
banging. banging on the door.

860
00:57:58.997 --> 00:58:02.043
And every time they
would bang on the door...

861
00:58:17.929 --> 00:58:23.238
Um. you think you're over it.
and then you're not.

862
00:58:23.325 --> 00:58:27.678
Um. I just remember every time
they banged on the door.

863
00:58:27.765 --> 00:58:29.157
um. you know.

864
00:58:29.244 --> 00:58:32.291
we would all just run up
and push the door--

865
00:58:32.378 --> 00:58:35.773
I mean. push the--
the table against the door.

866
00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:39.080
Um. and those were
the most terrifying times.

867
00:58:44.564 --> 00:58:47.175
Hey guys. hey hey!

868
00:59:02.147 --> 00:59:05.498
USA! USA! USA!

869
00:59:05.585 --> 00:59:08.893
USA! USA!
USA!

870
00:59:11.504 --> 00:59:12.853
We need people.

871
00:59:22.384 --> 00:59:24.082
At some point. I finally
make it into the tunnel.

872
00:59:27.302 --> 00:59:28.739
Push!

873
00:59:28.826 --> 00:59:30.784
There was no order
to go in there.

874
00:59:30.871 --> 00:59:33.134
I didn't hear about
any level of importance

875
00:59:33.221 --> 00:59:34.919
because I didn't have
my radio at that point.

876
00:59:35.006 --> 00:59:37.791
It was just where the fight was.
and I knew I needed to go to it.

877
00:59:41.403 --> 00:59:43.710
Now. myself. these officers
that I'm with.

878
00:59:43.797 --> 00:59:45.146
we're essentially trapped
in the Capitol

879
00:59:45.233 --> 00:59:47.584
because you have
these thousands of people

880
00:59:47.671 --> 00:59:50.021
that are now aggressively
trying to get in.

881
00:59:54.242 --> 01:00:00.205
It felt like a. for-real
riot. like pushing back.

882
01:00:05.863 --> 01:00:07.647
Felt like it was organized

883
01:00:07.734 --> 01:00:09.649
and people knew
what they were doing.

884
01:00:09.736 --> 01:00:12.304
You just don't go. you know.
there with tactical gear on

885
01:00:12.391 --> 01:00:14.523
and looking like
you're military personnel

886
01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:16.700
without knowing
what you were doing.

887
01:00:16.917 --> 01:00:18.832
Supply lines coming through.

888
01:00:21.792 --> 01:00:23.924
Keep in mind.
we have the vice president

889
01:00:24.011 --> 01:00:27.145
and other members
of Congress in the building.

890
01:00:27.232 --> 01:00:29.930
And if the building
is surrounded

891
01:00:30.017 --> 01:00:34.761
and a person or group
of people access the tunnel.

892
01:00:34.848 --> 01:00:37.677
it puts the leaders of
our democracy in a very.

893
01:00:37.764 --> 01:00:40.332
very. very bad situation.

894
01:00:49.515 --> 01:00:52.170
We were all just pushing
the table against the door

895
01:00:52.257 --> 01:00:54.389
with all our might.

896
01:00:54.476 --> 01:00:56.740
How do we know that
we're not running to the door

897
01:00:56.827 --> 01:00:59.394
and they're not about to.
like. shoot a bullet through.

898
01:00:59.481 --> 01:01:01.701
We had literally no idea.

899
01:01:04.573 --> 01:01:06.097
The news started to spread.

900
01:01:06.184 --> 01:01:08.490
And I just remember
getting message

901
01:01:08.577 --> 01:01:12.016
after message after message
asking. you know. if I was okay.

902
01:01:12.103 --> 01:01:15.019
And I remember saying to
each person. just please pray.

903
01:01:20.981 --> 01:01:22.330
Meantime on the floor.

904
01:01:22.417 --> 01:01:24.593
it was total chaos
and bedlam by then.

905
01:01:26.378 --> 01:01:29.686
There was this
extraordinary pounding.

906
01:01:29.773 --> 01:01:33.428
barreling sound
coming at the center door

907
01:01:33.515 --> 01:01:34.995
of the House of Representatives.

908
01:01:36.344 --> 01:01:37.955
Everybody stay down.

909
01:01:46.224 --> 01:01:49.270
I'll never forget that sound.
It was really haunting.

910
01:01:49.357 --> 01:01:52.099
Just the sound
of basically a mob.

911
01:01:52.186 --> 01:01:55.233
trying to barrel its way in.
smashing up against the door.

912
01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:58.149
And people began
to run towards the door.

913
01:01:59.237 --> 01:02:01.718
Then some Capitol officers
came in with their guns

914
01:02:01.805 --> 01:02:03.632
and told all of us to get back.

915
01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:06.548
And they stood by the door
with their guns drawn.

916
01:02:08.899 --> 01:02:11.336
Everybody was imagining that
somebody was gonna come in

917
01:02:11.423 --> 01:02:14.861
with an AR 15. that there
would be a mass shooting

918
01:02:14.948 --> 01:02:16.863
and that it would
be focused on

919
01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:19.083
the Democratic
side of the aisle

920
01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:20.867
and the Democratic galleries.

921
01:02:20.954 --> 01:02:23.740
So. they were telling us all
to take off our pins.

922
01:02:23.827 --> 01:02:25.742
These are the little pins
that get us into the buildings.

923
01:02:25.829 --> 01:02:27.221
And they're telling us.
take your pins off.

924
01:02:27.308 --> 01:02:28.832
It makes you recognizable.

925
01:02:28.919 --> 01:02:30.311
And then the Democrats
were saying.

926
01:02:30.398 --> 01:02:32.313
get off of the Democratic
side of the aisle.

927
01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:37.057
USA. USA. USA. USA.

928
01:02:38.929 --> 01:02:42.106
USA. USA.

929
01:02:45.457 --> 01:02:48.677
Meantime. we were all being
shepherded towards the front.

930
01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:54.248
And we got up to the Speaker's
lobby and we went to the right.

931
01:02:54.335 --> 01:02:58.165
To the left is where there
were a handful of officers.

932
01:02:58.252 --> 01:03:01.386
And then the mob was on the
other side of the doors there.

933
01:03:02.648 --> 01:03:04.084
Let me in!

934
01:03:10.221 --> 01:03:13.311
That's. um...

935
01:03:13.398 --> 01:03:15.661
that's where one of
the protesters got killed.

936
01:03:15.748 --> 01:03:17.619
Break that down!

937
01:03:17.706 --> 01:03:18.882
Break it down. Break that!

938
01:03:18.969 --> 01:03:20.405
Let's go.

939
01:03:40.468 --> 01:03:41.818
That sound like
a fucking gun shot.

940
01:03:42.775 --> 01:03:44.037
Oh. shit.

941
01:03:44.124 --> 01:03:47.780
Oh. my God.
a woman has been shot.

942
01:03:59.792 --> 01:04:01.533
Where's she hit?

943
01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:04.449
Back Up. Back up.

944
01:04:04.536 --> 01:04:06.146
Yo medic. where's she hit?

945
01:04:06.233 --> 01:04:07.495
We can't save her.

946
01:04:07.756 --> 01:04:09.367
Get the fuck back.
We can't save her!

947
01:04:09.454 --> 01:04:10.759
You guys gotta calm down.

948
01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:12.587
We got blood on the floor.

949
01:04:12.674 --> 01:04:15.025
There's blood
on the floor of our fucking...

950
01:04:22.467 --> 01:04:24.208
<i>Report of one shot
in the Capitol.</i>

951
01:04:24.295 --> 01:04:26.253
<i>Report of a shooting
in the Capitol.</i>

952
01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:27.994
<i>trying to ascertain
information now.</i>

953
01:04:28.081 --> 01:04:30.127
<i>Capitol command of recon.
report of one shot.</i>

954
01:04:30.214 --> 01:04:32.216
<i>Capitol command of recon.
is this gonna be</i>

955
01:04:32.303 --> 01:04:34.522
<i>an active shooter event.
or is this just one shot?</i>

956
01:04:34.609 --> 01:04:36.002
<i>I need more information.</i>

957
01:04:36.089 --> 01:04:37.612
<i>This will be a
report of one shot.</i>

958
01:04:37.699 --> 01:04:39.745
<i>Unknown about
the victim or the location.</i>

959
01:04:41.399 --> 01:04:43.183
We just didn't know.

960
01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:45.446
We were trying
to get confirmation.

961
01:04:45.533 --> 01:04:47.405
Is anyone shot in the Capitol?

962
01:04:47.492 --> 01:04:51.191
Were those shots fired?
Were they some type
of incendiary device?

963
01:04:51.278 --> 01:04:53.150
We don't know.
Was it just a distraction

964
01:04:53.237 --> 01:04:54.978
to kind of get us
in a different area?

965
01:04:55.065 --> 01:04:56.980
We did not know.

966
01:04:57.067 --> 01:05:00.897
And I think that was probably
the scariest thing. not knowing.

967
01:05:00.984 --> 01:05:03.725
We the people! We the people!

968
01:05:05.814 --> 01:05:06.946
This is...

969
01:05:14.954 --> 01:05:17.652
It makes you seek
answers. So. what do I do?

970
01:05:17.739 --> 01:05:19.393
Of course.
I'm talking to people.

971
01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:21.918
I interview people right
then. right on the steps.

972
01:05:22.005 --> 01:05:23.397
You know. right there.

973
01:05:25.356 --> 01:05:28.402
Yeah... look at 'em.

974
01:05:28.489 --> 01:05:31.623
And you know. I met this woman.
we were probably 10 feet away

975
01:05:31.710 --> 01:05:34.669
from. you know. where people
were trying to get in.

976
01:05:34.756 --> 01:05:37.759
She sounded so fucking
nice and so sweet.

977
01:05:37.846 --> 01:05:39.892
And she was so polite.

978
01:05:39.979 --> 01:05:42.112
You okay. baby?
Yeah. I'm good.

979
01:05:42.199 --> 01:05:43.809
I'm prepared to die.
Huh?

980
01:05:43.896 --> 01:05:46.116
Yes. I'm prepared to die.
Wait a second.

981
01:05:46.203 --> 01:05:50.729
For my country. and my children
and my grandchildren. all day.

982
01:05:50.816 --> 01:05:52.731
You're saying you're
prepared to die today?

983
01:05:52.818 --> 01:05:55.952
Yes. I love America.

984
01:05:56.039 --> 01:05:57.823
And I was like. what?

985
01:05:57.910 --> 01:05:59.216
You prepared to die?

986
01:06:01.914 --> 01:06:04.699
I could not fucking believe

987
01:06:04.786 --> 01:06:06.963
what the fuck
I was seeing and hearing.

988
01:06:12.142 --> 01:06:14.144
I felt embarrassed. you know.

989
01:06:14.231 --> 01:06:16.668
for all of us. you know.

990
01:06:16.755 --> 01:06:21.412
for all of America. you know.
to hear what I was hearing.

991
01:06:21.499 --> 01:06:24.981
to see what I was seeing. to
document what I was documenting.

992
01:06:36.253 --> 01:06:40.909
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

993
01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:46.915
We were all scared.

994
01:07:01.278 --> 01:07:03.628
The manpower we had inside
the tunnel that day.

995
01:07:03.715 --> 01:07:05.717
which seemed like
a lot. wasn't enough.

996
01:07:05.804 --> 01:07:10.330
It was about maybe four
or five-ish people could
fit in there wide.

997
01:07:10.417 --> 01:07:13.290
And it was a few dozen
officers in there

998
01:07:13.377 --> 01:07:15.335
trying to hold back
the crowd outside.

999
01:07:30.916 --> 01:07:32.700
You could see officers who were

1000
01:07:32.787 --> 01:07:35.355
getting injured at the front.
falling out. coming to the back.

1001
01:07:37.792 --> 01:07:40.882
The boiler room in the Capitol
became our decon room.

1002
01:07:43.233 --> 01:07:45.626
There were so many officers that
had their hands on their knees

1003
01:07:45.713 --> 01:07:49.282
because they couldn't see
because they're shut down

1004
01:07:49.369 --> 01:07:51.284
from the chemicals that
were just used against them.

1005
01:07:51.371 --> 01:07:53.939
And as those officers fell back.
we would move forward

1006
01:07:54.026 --> 01:07:55.810
and continue moving forward

1007
01:07:55.897 --> 01:08:01.860
until it was your turn
at the front. essentially.

1008
01:08:03.731 --> 01:08:04.950
It felt like war.

1009
01:08:18.746 --> 01:08:21.619
I'm seeing scenes unfold

1010
01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:24.752
all around me.

1011
01:08:24.839 --> 01:08:26.885
This is our country!

1012
01:08:26.972 --> 01:08:29.148
This is our country!

1013
01:08:29.235 --> 01:08:30.584
Yeah!

1014
01:08:32.847 --> 01:08:34.936
I'm seeing anxiety.

1015
01:08:37.722 --> 01:08:39.550
I'm seeing sadness.

1016
01:08:39.637 --> 01:08:42.118
I'm seeing pain.

1017
01:08:52.911 --> 01:08:54.130
You know...

1018
01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:58.830
twice when
I was there. you know.

1019
01:08:58.917 --> 01:09:01.180
I felt the emotion to cry.

1020
01:09:03.226 --> 01:09:05.097
And quite frankly.
probably I didn't stop myself.

1021
01:09:05.184 --> 01:09:07.839
Some shit distracted me
from that emotion.

1022
01:09:07.926 --> 01:09:10.146
It's like. Oh. shit.
there's a hockey stick.

1023
01:09:10.233 --> 01:09:12.409
Oh. shit. where the fuck did
they get a ladder from?

1024
01:09:12.496 --> 01:09:14.150
Oh. shit.
what is this tubing?

1025
01:09:14.237 --> 01:09:15.803
Where the hell
did that come from?

1026
01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:17.979
The guy's head is all red
from pepper spray

1027
01:09:18.066 --> 01:09:19.503
and looks like he can't breathe.

1028
01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:22.288
Oh. shit. I'm getting
soaked up by the gas.

1029
01:09:22.375 --> 01:09:24.508
and I can't fucking breathe.

1030
01:09:24.595 --> 01:09:26.466
and this shit hurts my eyes.

1031
01:09:26.553 --> 01:09:29.077
And why are people
keep returning

1032
01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:32.255
back to the front lines
to do it over and over again?

1033
01:09:32.342 --> 01:09:34.474
What is. what are they thinking?

1034
01:09:43.788 --> 01:09:46.051
I knew that this had to be
the biggest news story

1035
01:09:46.138 --> 01:09:47.705
in the world right now.

1036
01:09:47.792 --> 01:09:49.663
the United States
Capitol being under siege.

1037
01:09:49.750 --> 01:09:55.016
So. someone had to be trying
to get us help somewhere.

1038
01:09:55.103 --> 01:09:56.714
I was thinking. you know.

1039
01:09:56.801 --> 01:09:58.890
I hope I can hold on until
reinforcements gets here.

1040
01:10:00.413 --> 01:10:03.111
Our house! Our house!

1041
01:10:20.607 --> 01:10:22.870
We went down some stairwells.

1042
01:10:22.957 --> 01:10:23.958
and they tried to keep us
together.

1043
01:10:24.045 --> 01:10:26.874
and we were running for safety.

1044
01:10:32.489 --> 01:10:35.492
All that shit...!

1045
01:10:35.579 --> 01:10:39.670
At that point. I was most
concerned for Tabitha.

1046
01:10:39.974 --> 01:10:42.325
Hank. and Julie
and wanting to make sure

1047
01:10:42.412 --> 01:10:44.805
that they would get outta
that room. which was
still where the mob was.

1048
01:10:44.892 --> 01:10:49.201
USA! USA! USA!

1049
01:10:49.288 --> 01:10:51.508
And I just kept doing the same
thing over and over again.

1050
01:10:51.595 --> 01:10:54.250
calling the Capitol
police. calling Julie.

1051
01:10:54.337 --> 01:10:57.078
I was obviously profoundly
concerned for them.

1052
01:11:06.262 --> 01:11:08.829
I just wanted to make sure
they were in touch

1053
01:11:08.916 --> 01:11:12.180
so they knew who to open
the door for and who not to.

1054
01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:34.681
These people had made it clear
that they wanted

1055
01:11:34.768 --> 01:11:36.553
to kill certain
members of Congress.

1056
01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:38.598
And even if they got one person.

1057
01:11:38.685 --> 01:11:40.687
that would change
the balance of power.

1058
01:11:40.774 --> 01:11:43.168
So. you know.

1059
01:11:43.255 --> 01:11:46.214
I was definitely motivated to--

1060
01:11:48.869 --> 01:11:50.001
to win the fight.

1061
01:11:53.396 --> 01:11:56.312
I found myself at the front
of the line in the tunnel...

1062
01:11:59.402 --> 01:12:02.622
and I braced myself
against the doorframe

1063
01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:06.322
so that any backward
force I experienced

1064
01:12:06.409 --> 01:12:08.106
wasn't pushed
on the officers behind me.

1065
01:12:08.193 --> 01:12:10.456
but rather against the frame
of the building itself.

1066
01:12:23.251 --> 01:12:25.515
Unfortunately.
it backfired on me.

1067
01:12:25.602 --> 01:12:27.081
My arms were trapped.

1068
01:12:27.168 --> 01:12:30.171
I was essentially
standing up straight.

1069
01:12:30.258 --> 01:12:33.697
unable to defend myself
and at their mercy.

1070
01:12:54.282 --> 01:12:56.807
The man to my front. I remember

1071
01:12:56.894 --> 01:12:59.853
him just screaming at me

1072
01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:03.770
and. like. spit
or some kind of foam

1073
01:13:03.857 --> 01:13:05.685
coming out of his mouth.

1074
01:13:05.772 --> 01:13:09.472
It sounds. like. made up.
but that's what I remember.

1075
01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:23.442
He also was able
to wrestle away my baton

1076
01:13:23.529 --> 01:13:26.140
and beat me in the head
with it.

1077
01:13:26.227 --> 01:13:30.971
I could taste blood
coming out of my mouth.

1078
01:13:37.325 --> 01:13:42.026
Heave ho! Heave ho!

1079
01:13:42.113 --> 01:13:48.511
Heave ho! Heave ho!

1080
01:13:48.598 --> 01:13:53.167
I could feel just starting
to lose all of my perception.

1081
01:13:54.952 --> 01:13:57.476
and I was worried
that I would fall out there

1082
01:13:57.563 --> 01:14:00.566
and become a liability to my
colleagues and then. you know.

1083
01:14:00.653 --> 01:14:03.743
eventually be dragged out
and killed.

1084
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:04.962
Um...

1085
01:14:08.748 --> 01:14:11.272
I remember someone just
chanting. "Fight for Trump.

1086
01:14:11.359 --> 01:14:17.322
Fight for Trump.
Fight for Trump."

1087
01:14:25.809 --> 01:14:28.464
Thankfully. the other officers
behind me heard me

1088
01:14:28.551 --> 01:14:31.379
and were able to create
enough space to get
me out of there.

1089
01:14:34.382 --> 01:14:35.949
Everyone who worked
that day was injured.

1090
01:14:36.036 --> 01:14:37.255
Everyone was attacked.

1091
01:14:41.868 --> 01:14:44.044
Sometimes at great
personal cost.

1092
01:14:50.311 --> 01:14:54.359
The difference between
your typical angry riot

1093
01:14:54.446 --> 01:14:57.101
versus this was. this was...

1094
01:14:57.188 --> 01:14:58.450
it was personal.

1095
01:14:58.537 --> 01:15:01.235
And they were not stopping.

1096
01:15:01.322 --> 01:15:04.804
I wanna go home. and I want
every single officer that's
here to go home.

1097
01:15:04.891 --> 01:15:08.155
And my job right now.

1098
01:15:08.242 --> 01:15:11.550
their job right now is to figure
out a way to make that happen.

1099
01:15:11.637 --> 01:15:15.032
They fought like
hell. for hours.

1100
01:15:15.119 --> 01:15:17.730
That's not training that
police officers normally get.

1101
01:15:17.817 --> 01:15:19.950
Maybe the military.
they're trained for war.

1102
01:15:20.037 --> 01:15:23.170
fighting for hours.
days. months on end.

1103
01:15:23.257 --> 01:15:26.347
The fight that these
officers had in them.

1104
01:15:26.434 --> 01:15:29.307
even when they were injured.
to see them injured

1105
01:15:29.394 --> 01:15:31.701
and then get back
into the fight.

1106
01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:40.623
The fight wasn't over yet. and
the fight needed everybody

1107
01:15:40.710 --> 01:15:44.235
that was able.
And I'm not dead yet.

1108
01:15:44.322 --> 01:15:47.151
Uh. I was still.
uh. still in the fight.

1109
01:15:50.371 --> 01:15:54.201
Freedom. freedom. freedom.

1110
01:15:57.248 --> 01:16:00.120
It was like complete
chaos all around me.

1111
01:16:01.687 --> 01:16:04.734
I'm seeing one of
the darkest days

1112
01:16:04.821 --> 01:16:07.127
in modern history.

1113
01:16:07.214 --> 01:16:10.043
I was scared
for my fucking life.

1114
01:16:10.130 --> 01:16:12.480
but all I can think about is

1115
01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:15.266
making sure that I document

1116
01:16:15.353 --> 01:16:17.921
what's going on
to the best of my abilities.

1117
01:16:39.333 --> 01:16:40.596
Back up.

1118
01:17:43.702 --> 01:17:45.965
When I captured this image

1119
01:17:46.052 --> 01:17:49.447
and saw the police officer
that I now know

1120
01:17:49.534 --> 01:17:51.101
to be Michael Fanone.

1121
01:17:51.623 --> 01:17:53.843
get pulled down

1122
01:17:53.930 --> 01:17:58.369
from where he was
trying to stop the mob

1123
01:17:58.456 --> 01:18:01.024
of MAGA people
from getting inside...

1124
01:18:07.247 --> 01:18:09.554
I'm like reliving it
in my brain right now.

1125
01:18:09.641 --> 01:18:15.081
Like. I have all of the frames
just going in my head.

1126
01:18:18.128 --> 01:18:21.392
The look
on this man's face was.

1127
01:18:21.479 --> 01:18:25.222
"I am about to fucking die."

1128
01:18:26.266 --> 01:18:29.705
You don't see police officers
look like that very often.

1129
01:18:31.968 --> 01:18:37.103
Police officers are
stoic. proud. in control.

1130
01:18:37.190 --> 01:18:41.107
This officer was not in control
of a motherfucking thing.

1131
01:18:41.194 --> 01:18:43.588
If they wanted to kill him.
they would've killed him.

1132
01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:48.027
The man pleaded for his life.
told people he has kids.

1133
01:18:50.856 --> 01:18:54.164
Well. I'm thinking like. holy
shit. this man is about to die.

1134
01:18:54.251 --> 01:18:57.863
And here I am about
to capture this shit.

1135
01:19:05.828 --> 01:19:08.352
It's kind of crazy 'cause
if I had to put. you know.

1136
01:19:08.439 --> 01:19:11.921
a dollar on it. I would
say everyone there is.
"Blue Lives Matter.

1137
01:19:12.008 --> 01:19:13.749
Blue Lives Matter."

1138
01:19:14.967 --> 01:19:17.143
They didn't fucking
matter that day.

1139
01:19:17.230 --> 01:19:19.319
I felt for him.

1140
01:19:20.799 --> 01:19:22.148
I have a son.

1141
01:19:22.235 --> 01:19:25.108
I thought about
what it would feel like for him

1142
01:19:25.195 --> 01:19:27.980
if some shit happened to me.

1143
01:19:28.067 --> 01:19:31.027
You know. that's
another human being.

1144
01:19:31.114 --> 01:19:33.333
Are there times that I
don't feel bad for cops?

1145
01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:34.726
Fucking right.

1146
01:19:39.383 --> 01:19:43.300
Derek Chauvin could kiss
my black ass. straight up.

1147
01:19:48.044 --> 01:19:51.308
That could be fucking me.
That coulda been any of us.

1148
01:19:51.395 --> 01:19:55.486
Like. I'm pissed off right now.
just by talking about. you know.

1149
01:19:55.573 --> 01:19:58.271
the. what happened
to George Floyd.

1150
01:19:58.358 --> 01:20:02.319
And what's happened to many.

1151
01:20:02.406 --> 01:20:05.017
many other people that have died

1152
01:20:06.279 --> 01:20:08.064
in the hands of police.

1153
01:20:08.151 --> 01:20:09.239
You know. it's.

1154
01:20:14.026 --> 01:20:18.422
I feel like if you weren't angry
about what happened...

1155
01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:26.082
...to George Floyd
on that fucking day.

1156
01:20:26.169 --> 01:20:28.693
you're not a fucking human.

1157
01:20:29.999 --> 01:20:34.177
You lack everything that
it takes to be a human being.

1158
01:20:34.264 --> 01:20:37.397
If that shit didn't
piss you the fuck off.

1159
01:20:47.407 --> 01:20:51.063
America has been rearing
its ugly fucking head

1160
01:20:51.150 --> 01:20:55.285
for many fucking years
over and over and over again.

1161
01:20:55.372 --> 01:20:58.027
And I'm documenting it all.

1162
01:20:58.114 --> 01:21:00.420
All I can do is
get these photos out

1163
01:21:00.507 --> 01:21:03.206
and show the world you know.
what I saw.

1164
01:21:06.078 --> 01:21:09.125
This is real-life America.

1165
01:21:14.782 --> 01:21:18.177
So. yeah. I felt for him.
I felt for...

1166
01:21:19.613 --> 01:21:21.659
...us. I felt for Americans.

1167
01:21:21.746 --> 01:21:24.183
I felt for. you
know. this world.

1168
01:21:24.270 --> 01:21:26.577
this is what it's come to.

1169
01:21:28.318 --> 01:21:31.887
Pull. Pull. Pull.

1170
01:22:00.828 --> 01:22:02.395
I came for fucking war. man.

1171
01:22:04.006 --> 01:22:08.271
We have a national.
international. crisis

1172
01:22:08.358 --> 01:22:12.101
unfolding right here
in the nation's Capitol.

1173
01:22:14.233 --> 01:22:16.583
The gravity
and the weight of that is huge.

1174
01:22:16.670 --> 01:22:19.804
Knowing that the eyes
of the world

1175
01:22:19.891 --> 01:22:23.068
are literally watching
our democracy crumble.

1176
01:22:25.810 --> 01:22:27.246
At this hour.

1177
01:22:27.333 --> 01:22:30.946
our democracy is under
unprecedented assault.

1178
01:22:31.033 --> 01:22:34.862
unlike anything we've
seen in modern times.

1179
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:41.217
An assault in the citadel of
Liberty. the Capitol itself.

1180
01:22:41.304 --> 01:22:44.089
An assault on the people's
representatives

1181
01:22:44.437 --> 01:22:47.397
and the Capitol Hill police
sworn to protect them.

1182
01:22:54.447 --> 01:22:57.798
We had an election that
was stolen from us.

1183
01:22:58.321 --> 01:23:02.194
It was a landslide election.
and everyone knows it.

1184
01:23:02.281 --> 01:23:05.502
But we can't play into
the hands of these people.

1185
01:23:06.764 --> 01:23:08.548
We have to have peace.

1186
01:23:08.635 --> 01:23:10.115
So go home.

1187
01:23:10.202 --> 01:23:11.464
We love you.

1188
01:23:11.551 --> 01:23:13.075
You're very special.

1189
01:23:13.162 --> 01:23:15.338
You've seen what happens.
you see the way others

1190
01:23:15.425 --> 01:23:17.862
are treated that are so bad
and so evil.

1191
01:23:39.492 --> 01:23:42.582
"I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!"

1192
01:24:05.649 --> 01:24:06.911
'Cause...

1193
01:25:54.801 --> 01:25:56.890
How could anyone be proud
of what they were doing?

1194
01:25:56.977 --> 01:25:59.719
Even if you don't agree
with the election.

1195
01:25:59.806 --> 01:26:01.591
how could you be proud of that?

1196
01:26:01.678 --> 01:26:03.767
You've tried to storm
the fucking

1197
01:26:03.854 --> 01:26:05.899
United States Capitol
building--

1198
01:26:05.986 --> 01:26:10.077
not try to storm--
you did. you got in.

1199
01:26:10.165 --> 01:26:12.167
And people died.

1200
01:26:21.611 --> 01:26:24.222
When I began to see the
magnitude of the violence

1201
01:26:24.309 --> 01:26:28.748
that was taking place.
I just grew more and more.

1202
01:26:28.835 --> 01:26:32.491
I don't wanna say hysterical.
but more and more agitated

1203
01:26:32.578 --> 01:26:36.060
about Tabitha and Hank
not being with us.

1204
01:26:39.106 --> 01:26:41.805
I was aware of not wanting to
create surplus fear

1205
01:26:41.892 --> 01:26:45.112
and anxiety on their part.
but I was pretty angry.

1206
01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:48.812
USA. USA. USA.

1207
01:26:48.899 --> 01:26:52.424
USA. USA. USA.

1208
01:26:54.557 --> 01:26:56.950
We just sat there in silence.

1209
01:26:57.037 --> 01:26:59.866
I remember thinking
a lot about my mom.

1210
01:27:03.566 --> 01:27:06.308
You know. I think.

1211
01:27:06.395 --> 01:27:08.223
well. you know.

1212
01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:11.617
my mom lives with me.
she has Alzheimers.

1213
01:27:11.704 --> 01:27:14.229
And I didn't necessarily want to
get in contact with her

1214
01:27:14.316 --> 01:27:16.883
because
I didn't want her to worry.

1215
01:27:16.970 --> 01:27:19.538
I just wanted to be there.

1216
01:27:19.625 --> 01:27:21.453
You know?

1217
01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:23.542
I think that's what
I thought about the most.

1218
01:27:23.629 --> 01:27:27.851
At the end of the day.
I'm kind of all she has.

1219
01:27:27.938 --> 01:27:29.896
So...

1220
01:27:32.551 --> 01:27:36.207
Stop the steal. stop the steal.
stop the steal.

1221
01:27:46.522 --> 01:27:51.091
USA. USA. USA.

1222
01:28:12.156 --> 01:28:14.245
We reached out far
and wide as we could

1223
01:28:14.332 --> 01:28:17.248
to get people here
to support us.

1224
01:28:17.335 --> 01:28:19.685
So. whether the National Guard
showed up. didn't showed up.

1225
01:28:19.772 --> 01:28:22.122
whatever the case may be.
there were police officers

1226
01:28:22.209 --> 01:28:25.256
that we were calling on from
all around this area to assist.

1227
01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:35.919
We love you. President Trump.

1228
01:28:40.489 --> 01:28:43.100
Traitors!

1229
01:28:43.187 --> 01:28:44.667
Traitors!

1230
01:28:50.499 --> 01:28:54.329
My God. Oh. my fucking God.

1231
01:29:02.685 --> 01:29:06.341
When I saw that manpower
coming with the munitions

1232
01:29:06.428 --> 01:29:10.562
that we needed to handle the--
this crowd. that was...

1233
01:29:10.649 --> 01:29:13.130
"Okay. we're gonna
get through this."

1234
01:29:17.047 --> 01:29:19.310
Normally. it's
the federal government

1235
01:29:19.397 --> 01:29:21.486
that's coming to the aid
of local law enforcement.

1236
01:29:21.573 --> 01:29:24.141
local jurisdictions.

1237
01:29:24.228 --> 01:29:28.232
That day. local jurisdictions

1238
01:29:28.319 --> 01:29:30.495
came to support
the federal government.

1239
01:29:33.324 --> 01:29:34.978
Some of them are MPD officers.

1240
01:29:35.065 --> 01:29:36.980
some of 'em are
Virginia State Police.

1241
01:29:37.067 --> 01:29:40.375
You start seeing them
push the crowd back.

1242
01:30:00.830 --> 01:30:03.963
They're coming down
the West Front of the Capitol.

1243
01:30:04.050 --> 01:30:06.096
I. I remember having
a sense of like.

1244
01:30:06.183 --> 01:30:07.619
like. we taking it back.

1245
01:30:26.246 --> 01:30:28.161
We kept hearing those knocks.

1246
01:30:28.248 --> 01:30:34.298
One time. it was just such
a violent shaking of the door.

1247
01:30:34.385 --> 01:30:36.822
And that's when they.
they just kicked it in...

1248
01:30:39.477 --> 01:30:41.348
and their guns drawn.

1249
01:30:42.785 --> 01:30:45.440
That was by far the
scariest moment of my life

1250
01:30:45.527 --> 01:30:47.442
'cause I did not know
who kicked the door in.

1251
01:30:47.529 --> 01:30:49.095
and I saw all those guns.

1252
01:30:50.923 --> 01:30:54.449
And we just had our hands up.
and we had our hands up
for a long time.

1253
01:30:56.451 --> 01:30:59.366
You know. it's not a good
feeling having to walk around

1254
01:30:59.454 --> 01:31:02.935
the halls of Congress with your
hands up past insurrectionists

1255
01:31:03.022 --> 01:31:05.938
who actually should
have their hands up.

1256
01:31:06.025 --> 01:31:08.463
You know.
that's not a good feeling.

1257
01:31:13.729 --> 01:31:15.818
I will never forget.

1258
01:31:15.905 --> 01:31:18.995
in front of Congressman
Steny Hoyer's office.

1259
01:31:19.082 --> 01:31:22.825
there was a poster of John Lewis
that referenced. you know.

1260
01:31:22.912 --> 01:31:24.566
getting in good trouble.

1261
01:31:24.653 --> 01:31:27.133
and the poster
was ripped to shreds.

1262
01:31:34.053 --> 01:31:36.708
I just remember how
hateful that was.

1263
01:31:36.795 --> 01:31:39.319
to come in and rip up the poster
the way they did

1264
01:31:39.406 --> 01:31:41.496
and to just desecrate
the Capitol the way they did.

1265
01:31:41.583 --> 01:31:44.237
And I remember also walking past

1266
01:31:44.324 --> 01:31:47.066
one of the insurrectionists
that they had handcuffed.

1267
01:31:47.153 --> 01:31:50.243
And I just remember
looking at him. and he laughed.

1268
01:31:50.330 --> 01:31:52.768
You know.
it was... it was funny to him.

1269
01:31:52.855 --> 01:31:54.770
It was unnerving.

1270
01:31:59.078 --> 01:32:01.994
Finally.
Tabitha and Hank and Julie

1271
01:32:02.081 --> 01:32:05.171
were brought over to us
by the officers.

1272
01:32:05.258 --> 01:32:06.956
and it was tearful.

1273
01:32:08.131 --> 01:32:10.002
I was racked with
a lot of guilt.

1274
01:32:12.831 --> 01:32:16.879
I got someone who works with me
on my staff to drive them home.

1275
01:32:16.966 --> 01:32:19.708
Before they left. I gave them
a big hug. and it was again.

1276
01:32:19.795 --> 01:32:25.191
really emotional.
And I... said I was sorry.

1277
01:32:25.278 --> 01:32:28.847
And I said to Tabitha.
"The next time you come back

1278
01:32:28.934 --> 01:32:30.893
to the Capitol.
it's not gonna be like this."

1279
01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:33.809
And then she said.
"I don't want to come
back to the Capitol."

1280
01:32:35.419 --> 01:32:40.163
And it just...
it just rocked me.

1281
01:32:49.868 --> 01:32:51.957
I turned
the ISO up on my camera.

1282
01:32:52.044 --> 01:32:55.221
and I had this dark photo
of this flag waving

1283
01:32:55.308 --> 01:32:58.703
and smoke.
this tear gas is coming down.

1284
01:32:58.790 --> 01:33:02.707
and there's hardly
any more people at the top.

1285
01:33:02.794 --> 01:33:06.798
It just was weirdly over.

1286
01:33:15.677 --> 01:33:17.200
So. earlier there was a lot
of people out here.

1287
01:33:17.287 --> 01:33:18.854
and I guess
it's thinned out a little bit.

1288
01:33:21.117 --> 01:33:23.206
Oh. so somebody got a souvenir.

1289
01:33:23.293 --> 01:33:24.381
Jesus.

1290
01:33:25.774 --> 01:33:28.167
You know.
I walked two blocks.

1291
01:33:28.254 --> 01:33:30.779
called a Uber.

1292
01:33:30.866 --> 01:33:36.132
I just remember looking at
who my driver was gonna be.

1293
01:33:36.219 --> 01:33:39.135
and I was so relieved that
this driver was a Black man...

1294
01:33:40.702 --> 01:33:44.096
because I really honestly
couldn't deal

1295
01:33:44.183 --> 01:33:47.360
with any more
white folks that day.

1296
01:33:47.447 --> 01:33:49.624
I couldn't. I was just over it.

1297
01:33:51.364 --> 01:33:53.410
I needed that at that moment.

1298
01:33:53.497 --> 01:33:58.850
I needed someone that
I could relate to.

1299
01:33:58.937 --> 01:34:01.592
that was on the same
wavelength as me.

1300
01:34:01.679 --> 01:34:04.508
that was the same...
that was a brother.

1301
01:34:04.595 --> 01:34:06.553
Like. I needed to tell that
Black man.

1302
01:34:06.641 --> 01:34:09.339
like.
what I just went through.

1303
01:34:09.426 --> 01:34:11.167
Then I went up to the room

1304
01:34:11.254 --> 01:34:15.127
and. um. almost started crying.

1305
01:34:18.696 --> 01:34:21.264
I almost started.
and I stopped myself

1306
01:34:21.351 --> 01:34:23.658
and I was like. "Alright.
well. I got fucking work to do.

1307
01:34:23.745 --> 01:34:26.443
Let's not go through this
emotional shit right now.

1308
01:34:26.530 --> 01:34:29.359
You gotta fucking just focus

1309
01:34:29.446 --> 01:34:32.275
and get this job done."

1310
01:34:33.929 --> 01:34:36.018
And I'm thinking
about my boy who's over there.

1311
01:34:36.105 --> 01:34:38.368
You know. it's like I'm trying
to fucking make it home

1312
01:34:38.455 --> 01:34:42.677
and get the fuck up
out of here so I can see my son.

1313
01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:58.301
Eventually. the fatigue
of the day caught up with me.

1314
01:34:58.388 --> 01:35:00.782
and when I saw that
I could take a break.

1315
01:35:00.869 --> 01:35:03.393
I went back inside and sat down.

1316
01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:08.920
I found out later on
I had a large contusion
underneath my hair.

1317
01:35:09.007 --> 01:35:10.966
Then I had a headache
for about two weeks.

1318
01:35:11.053 --> 01:35:14.665
So. I likely had a concussion.

1319
01:35:14.752 --> 01:35:17.276
If I had taken
another blow like that.

1320
01:35:17.363 --> 01:35:19.104
especially in the same place.
that very easily could have

1321
01:35:19.191 --> 01:35:23.282
caused serious brain
damage or been fatal.

1322
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:31.203
Our cops ended up
with broken jaws. broken necks.

1323
01:35:31.290 --> 01:35:33.292
broken arms. legs. fingers.

1324
01:35:33.379 --> 01:35:35.381
One officer lost three fingers.

1325
01:35:35.468 --> 01:35:39.124
People had traumatic
brain injury.

1326
01:35:39.211 --> 01:35:42.998
dozens and dozens ending up with
Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome.

1327
01:35:44.608 --> 01:35:48.133
It was just hard to believe that
this was going on in America.

1328
01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:52.268
And it was going on. you know.
downstairs from where we were.

1329
01:35:52.355 --> 01:35:55.706
and Donald Trump wasn't
doing anything to stop it.

1330
01:35:55.793 --> 01:35:58.883
And the National Guard
was just absent...

1331
01:36:00.189 --> 01:36:02.147
and we were dumbfounded.

1332
01:36:20.209 --> 01:36:22.907
<i>Congressman Raskin
is joining us now.</i>

1333
01:36:22.994 --> 01:36:25.301
<i>Congressman. obviously you
can't share everything with us.</i>

1334
01:36:25.388 --> 01:36:28.478
<i>but what have you learned
about what comes next?</i>

1335
01:36:28.565 --> 01:36:31.220
<i>I don't know. but I'll tell you
this but every single member</i>

1336
01:36:31.307 --> 01:36:35.702
<i>that I've spoken to
is absolutely determined
to have us complete</i>

1337
01:36:35.790 --> 01:36:38.314
<i>the counting of the
Electoral College votes.</i>

1338
01:36:38.401 --> 01:36:41.796
<i>and. uh.
American constitutional
democracy will prevail.</i>

1339
01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:38.853
Nobody ever said
it would be easy.

1340
01:37:40.767 --> 01:37:42.900
But healing begins
with the truth.

1341
01:37:44.728 --> 01:37:48.210
I mean. there was an effort
almost instantly to bury

1342
01:37:48.297 --> 01:37:52.518
and rewrite the history
of what happened on January 6th.

1343
01:37:52.605 --> 01:37:55.260
You don't almost knock over the
government of the United States

1344
01:37:55.347 --> 01:37:57.088
by accident.

1345
01:37:57.175 --> 01:38:01.876
It's not an impulse move.

1346
01:38:01.963 --> 01:38:05.705
This was an organized
attack on the government.

1347
01:38:05.792 --> 01:38:09.100
if you allow for
there to be confusion.

1348
01:38:09.187 --> 01:38:11.059
propaganda
and disinformation about it.

1349
01:38:11.146 --> 01:38:15.411
Then that's very dangerous
because it conditions

1350
01:38:15.498 --> 01:38:17.152
the society to accept it

1351
01:38:17.239 --> 01:38:20.720
and licenses political violence
in the future.

1352
01:38:24.550 --> 01:38:26.335
It was a traumatic experience.

1353
01:38:26.422 --> 01:38:30.730
probably the most traumatic
event that I've dealt with.

1354
01:38:30.817 --> 01:38:38.434
But. for me. it's more of
losing trust in people.

1355
01:38:38.521 --> 01:38:40.827
You're talking about thousands
and thousands of people

1356
01:38:40.915 --> 01:38:46.398
that were willing to hurt us
to get what they want...

1357
01:38:47.747 --> 01:38:49.445
but then the next day.
probably go back to

1358
01:38:49.532 --> 01:38:51.447
respecting law enforcement. right?

1359
01:38:51.534 --> 01:38:53.275
How does that work?
How does that make sense?

1360
01:38:53.362 --> 01:38:56.539
How am I supposed
to respect that and trust you?

1361
01:38:59.324 --> 01:39:03.676
It was embarrassing.
to see what I was seeing.

1362
01:39:03.763 --> 01:39:07.593
you know.
to be an American.

1363
01:39:09.944 --> 01:39:12.555
The type of things

1364
01:39:12.642 --> 01:39:16.515
that happened
that day. you know.

1365
01:39:16.602 --> 01:39:19.779
theoretically
are not supposed to happen

1366
01:39:21.129 --> 01:39:23.392
in this country.

1367
01:39:23.479 --> 01:39:28.484
We're America. the greatest
country in the world.

1368
01:39:35.447 --> 01:39:40.409
My photos are showing you
things that you already know.

1369
01:39:44.413 --> 01:39:46.676
It's not really
exposing anything.

1370
01:39:46.763 --> 01:39:49.548
it's just showing
you what's real.

1371
01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:55.032
Hopefully. you know. the photos
help make life better for...

1372
01:39:55.119 --> 01:39:59.080
Like. hopefully. my son doesn't
have to have a movement.

1373
01:39:59.167 --> 01:40:02.648
Be a part of a movement
like what I've been a part of.

1374
01:40:02.735 --> 01:40:05.608
or what my parents have been
a part of in the '60s.

1375
01:40:07.349 --> 01:40:10.308
But chances are.
he will be

1376
01:40:10.395 --> 01:40:12.658
because that's the way
the world works. you know.

1377
01:40:14.225 --> 01:40:16.488
The world is not perfect

1378
01:40:16.575 --> 01:40:19.448
and it can be
fucked up sometimes.

1379
01:40:24.322 --> 01:40:26.020
A violent insurrection
to overturn the election

1380
01:40:26.107 --> 01:40:28.326
is not an abstract thing.
as we've heard.

1381
01:40:28.413 --> 01:40:30.154
Hundreds of people
were bloodied.

1382
01:40:30.241 --> 01:40:32.330
injured. and wounded
in the process.

1383
01:40:32.417 --> 01:40:36.334
including more than
150 police officers.

1384
01:40:36.421 --> 01:40:39.424
some of them
sitting in this room today.

1385
01:40:39.511 --> 01:40:41.731
It's a dark day for America.

1386
01:40:41.818 --> 01:40:46.214
The Confederate flag was inside
the United States Capitol.

1387
01:40:46.301 --> 01:40:49.086
the flag of traitors.
and I say that as someone

1388
01:40:49.173 --> 01:40:51.958
born below the Mason-Dixon line.
who loves the South.

1389
01:40:53.699 --> 01:40:57.181
White supremacists rummaging

1390
01:40:57.268 --> 01:41:01.229
through the belongings
of our elected leaders.

1391
01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:07.931
It's hard to imagine how that
could be victory. right?

1392
01:41:11.978 --> 01:41:15.460
But power was transferred
that day peacefully.

1393
01:41:15.547 --> 01:41:19.421
The terrorists. very fortunate
that they got to go home.

1394
01:41:19.508 --> 01:41:21.727
but more of them are getting
arrested every day.

1395
01:41:24.295 --> 01:41:26.471
And. um.
victory doesn't always look like

1396
01:41:26.558 --> 01:41:30.084
what we want it to look like.
but we did win.

1397
01:41:30.171 --> 01:41:31.302
We won that day.

1398
01:41:36.481 --> 01:41:38.570
When you go
through something like
that. you don't really think

1399
01:41:38.657 --> 01:41:40.790
about the impact it had on you

1400
01:41:40.877 --> 01:41:43.793
until you decide
to talk about it again.

1401
01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:46.578
and then a lot of that
fear and terror

1402
01:41:46.665 --> 01:41:49.755
and pain comes back.

1403
01:41:49.842 --> 01:41:51.844
But. you know.
I don't know that there's

1404
01:41:51.931 --> 01:41:54.586
a whole lot of use
in being angry.

1405
01:41:54.673 --> 01:41:57.241
I think that anger
should be channeled

1406
01:41:57.328 --> 01:42:00.026
into the work that
we should continue to do.

1407
01:42:00.114 --> 01:42:01.767
That's why I stayed that night.

1408
01:42:04.030 --> 01:42:07.382
Being there. you know.
in the face of terrorism

1409
01:42:07.469 --> 01:42:09.558
and showing them that.
you know.

1410
01:42:09.645 --> 01:42:13.301
despite your attack on
democracy. democracy prevailed.

1411
01:42:14.998 --> 01:42:16.956
This is not the end of the book.

1412
01:42:17.043 --> 01:42:19.350
It's not the last
chapter of the book.

1413
01:42:19.437 --> 01:42:23.789
So. while I have an appreciation
for being

1414
01:42:23.876 --> 01:42:27.880
part of this historically
significant event...

1415
01:42:29.404 --> 01:42:32.494
I take comfort in knowing
that it's not the last chapter.

1416
01:42:34.191 --> 01:42:36.846
I think about what's ahead.

1417
01:42:36.933 --> 01:42:40.545
How strong we are.

1418
01:42:40.632 --> 01:42:44.114
After enduring all of these
things yet here I stand.

1419
01:42:44.201 --> 01:42:45.855
our country.

1420
01:42:45.942 --> 01:42:49.467
After going through all
the things that we go through.

1421
01:42:49.554 --> 01:42:52.340
democracy still moves forward.

1422
01:42:52.427 --> 01:42:55.473
And our last chapter is
still yet to be written.

1423
01:42:58.781 --> 01:43:00.609
But this is not the
problem of one party.

1424
01:43:00.696 --> 01:43:03.916
it is the problem of
the whole country now.

1425
01:43:04.003 --> 01:43:06.005
American democracy.
Mr. Chairman.

1426
01:43:06.092 --> 01:43:08.312
is a precious inheritance.

1427
01:43:08.399 --> 01:43:11.097
something rare
in the history of the world.

1428
01:43:11.185 --> 01:43:13.099
So. justice is part
of what we're doing.

1429
01:43:13.187 --> 01:43:15.189
but I would say
paramount is the truth.

1430
01:43:15.276 --> 01:43:17.321
We want to set out

1431
01:43:17.408 --> 01:43:20.585
a complete.
detailed historical record

1432
01:43:20.672 --> 01:43:22.631
of what happened and why.

1433
01:43:22.718 --> 01:43:24.720
And we've come a long way.

1434
01:43:24.807 --> 01:43:27.984
but obviously the progress

1435
01:43:28.071 --> 01:43:31.205
can be lost also
in the wink of an eye.

1436
01:43:33.859 --> 01:43:37.646
In a world of insurgent
authoritarianism.

1437
01:43:37.733 --> 01:43:41.519
of racism and antisemitism.
let's all hang tough for

1438
01:43:41.606 --> 01:43:43.304
American democracy.

1439
01:43:43.391 --> 01:43:45.610
Thank you. Mr. Chairman.
I yield back.

1440
01:43:49.962 --> 01:43:53.618
So. eternal vigilance.
that's the price of our liberty.

1441
01:43:53.705 --> 01:43:55.577
That's the price
of our democracy.

1442
01:43:55.664 --> 01:43:57.143
We've all got
to stay on the case.

1443
01:43:57.231 --> 01:43:59.320
It's something we
take care of together.
