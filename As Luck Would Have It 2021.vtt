[woman] Bonjour. Mr. Laurent.

10
00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:24.700
It's Lindsey Johnson.
How are you?

11
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.567
Ah. I'm glad to hear it.

12
00:00:26.567 --> 00:00:28.367
I was hoping
that our offer on your property

13
00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:29.867
was to your liking.

14
00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:32.767
Excellent.

15
00:00:32.767 --> 00:00:35.700
We're gonna build a beautiful
hotel together. Au revoir.

16
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.767
[woman] Lin.

17
00:00:39.767 --> 00:00:41.800
Bagel with egg and cheese.
extra large coffee.

18
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.600
-Welcome back.
-You are a lifesaver. Ellie.

19
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.800
But I guess
you'll probably be in Paris.

20
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.633
Yeah. I probably will be then.

21
00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:51.700
Let's do something fun tonight
now you're here for a minute.

22
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.100
We could go to that new tapas
place and drink some wine.

23
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.734
Or... I heard that the Met
is giving an after-hours talk

24
00:00:58.734 --> 00:01:01.500
on mid-century architecture.

25
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.333
Any chance you wanna be my date?

26
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:05.433
Dinner afterwards.
It will be my treat.

27
00:01:05.433 --> 00:01:08.867
If we can go to that sushi place
on 81st Street. then I am in.

28
00:01:08.867 --> 00:01:11.266
Oh. good. Done deal.

29
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:14.600
-[Ellie] All right.
-I'll see you in there.

30
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.433
[man] So. Ellie will take over
the Rosinksy estate in Boston.

31
00:01:17.433 --> 00:01:20.100
and Blake will handle
the Pinnacle Group project

32
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.367
with New Zealand. Next!

33
00:01:22.367 --> 00:01:27.467
I wanna turn our attention
to a new opportunity. Ireland.

34
00:01:27.467 --> 00:01:29.166
As you all know.

35
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:31.367
we've been looking to have
a presence there for years.

36
00:01:31.367 --> 00:01:33.467
I'm very interested
in a piece of land

37
00:01:33.467 --> 00:01:34.834
that's come to my attention.

38
00:01:34.834 --> 00:01:37.367
It's right on the coast.
here. in Kilabbey.

39
00:01:37.367 --> 00:01:39.633
The only problem is... Well...

40
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.100
That castle.

41
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.834
-Permitting nightmare?
-[man] If only.

42
00:01:43.834 --> 00:01:47.266
The town council
owns the property

43
00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:49.166
and they seem unwilling
to sell to anyone

44
00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:50.600
who wants
to take the castle down.

45
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.300
The challenge
is to make the council see

46
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.800
that selling to us.
and building something new.

47
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.834
will ultimately benefit
the community.

48
00:02:00.934 --> 00:02:03.367
Lindsey? I'd like you to go.

49
00:02:04.667 --> 00:02:06.433
I'd be happy to. Mr. Krispen.

50
00:02:06.433 --> 00:02:08.667
but. um... I'm preparing
to go to Paris.

51
00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:10.767
continuing the negotiations
with the Laurents.

52
00:02:10.767 --> 00:02:14.700
Your level of experience
can help us win this one.

53
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.000
-Hannah can cover Paris.
-I will start prepping.

54
00:02:23.367 --> 00:02:26.500
[laughter]

55
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.166
[woman] She did so much.

56
00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:30.767
Don't...
Don't bring that up again!

57
00:02:30.767 --> 00:02:32.900
-No. That's not fair.
-[man] Remember last year?

58
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.033
[woman] That's... No.
That's not fair.

59
00:02:35.033 --> 00:02:36.266
[laughter]

60
00:02:36.266 --> 00:02:37.834
[man] Oh. God.
she was a tragedy.

61
00:02:37.834 --> 00:02:40.667
Now. I don't want to hear
any whining and fighting

62
00:02:40.667 --> 00:02:44.100
about who teaches what and goes
where this year. all right?

63
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.033
Well. it's about time
you get used to it. Alroy.

64
00:02:46.033 --> 00:02:48.867
You've only been running the
festival for. what. 30 years?

65
00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:50.700
It's a wonder
anyone gets a match

66
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.533
-with the lot of you working it.
-Oh!

67
00:02:52.533 --> 00:02:54.734
All right. all right!
Now listen up.

68
00:02:54.734 --> 00:02:57.834
There's about to be 1.000 people
here in a few days.

69
00:02:57.834 --> 00:02:59.333
so let's get focused.

70
00:02:59.333 --> 00:03:00.967
-Maebh?
-Yes.

71
00:03:00.967 --> 00:03:03.400
You'll be teaching the afternoon
soda bread classes.

72
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.233
and. Rory. you'll be helping
with the paddleboarding.

73
00:03:06.233 --> 00:03:08.467
And. Brennan.
you're still up for doing

74
00:03:08.467 --> 00:03:10.100
the Gaelic football lessons

75
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.433
-and the hurdling?
-Mm-hmm.

76
00:03:11.433 --> 00:03:13.100
Maybe a field trip
to the cliffs?

77
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.967
I'm up for it. if I can teach
a few ballads on the bus.

78
00:03:15.967 --> 00:03:17.800
-Oh. no. thank you.
-Oh.

79
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.066
What if Rory sings with me?

80
00:03:19.066 --> 00:03:20.934
-No. not...
-[woman] Ah. go on.

81
00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:23.266
-[man] Come on.
-Not happening.

82
00:03:23.266 --> 00:03:25.667
But maybe Brennan
will céilí dance this year.

83
00:03:25.667 --> 00:03:27.834
-Oh. yeah. we've missed you.
-It's been too long.

84
00:03:27.834 --> 00:03:29.166
Not happening!

85
00:03:29.166 --> 00:03:30.633
[men laugh]

86
00:03:36.333 --> 00:03:39.133
Here we are.

87
00:03:39.133 --> 00:03:42.266
Not quite the night we had
envisioned but... you know.

88
00:03:42.266 --> 00:03:44.600
I'm sorry to change our plans.
Ellie.

89
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.400
I am really excited
that you're going to Ireland.

90
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.900
It's the most beautiful place.

91
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.600
with all those
quaint little towns.

92
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.300
Yeah.
Well. mine is about to put on

93
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.500
a matchmaking festival.

94
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.433
How about that for quaint?
[laughs]

95
00:03:57.433 --> 00:04:00.734
No! I bet you're gonna meet
so many single Irish men.

96
00:04:00.734 --> 00:04:03.533
And those accents?
I mean. come on.

97
00:04:03.533 --> 00:04:07.066
Yeah. just exactly what I'm
looking for on a business trip.

98
00:04:07.066 --> 00:04:09.367
Wait. wasn't your grandmother
from Ireland?

99
00:04:09.367 --> 00:04:11.166
Yeah. Good memory.

100
00:04:11.166 --> 00:04:12.800
Some tiny little town.

101
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.500
This is her ring.

102
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.834
I wish I asked my mom more
about her when I had the chance.

103
00:04:16.834 --> 00:04:18.967
My dad wasn't exactly
brimming with stories.

104
00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:21.734
I'm sure your mom would be
really happy you're going there.

105
00:04:21.734 --> 00:04:22.967
-Mm-hmm.
-Getting a sense

106
00:04:22.967 --> 00:04:24.133
of some of your ancestry.

107
00:04:24.133 --> 00:04:25.734
I think she would.

108
00:04:25.734 --> 00:04:27.367
I mean. if nothing else.
it'll be...

109
00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:28.400
Life-affirming.

110
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.033
I was gonna say uneventful.

111
00:04:31.033 --> 00:04:34.266
Who knows? Maybe this trip
will be really meaningful.

112
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.533
[Lindsey] Wow.
Are all the roads this windy?

113
00:04:45.533 --> 00:04:48.967
[man] Yep. Your first time
in the Emerald Isle?

114
00:04:48.967 --> 00:04:51.867
-I'm afraid so.
-I've lived here all my life.

115
00:04:51.867 --> 00:04:55.367
I can tell you. you won't find
a better spot in Ireland.

116
00:04:55.367 --> 00:04:58.367
[Lindsey] I'll have to take your
word for it. Conor. Wait! Stop!

117
00:05:35.567 --> 00:05:37.033
[sighs]

118
00:05:37.033 --> 00:05:40.233
[man humming]

119
00:05:45.033 --> 00:05:46.734
[Brennan hums]

120
00:05:50.133 --> 00:05:53.066
-Dia duit.
-Dia duit.

121
00:05:53.066 --> 00:05:55.133
I'm sorry. I. um...

122
00:05:55.133 --> 00:05:57.600
I was just looking around.

123
00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.066
The castle's
not officially open.

124
00:05:59.066 --> 00:06:01.000
but I don't mind you looking
while I tidy up.

125
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.600
It's a lot for one person
to tidy up.

126
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.600
-Rather grand. isn't she?
-Yeah.

127
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.667
Built in the 1300s
by the Ballydonal family.

128
00:06:08.667 --> 00:06:13.467
The last living member lived
here until... 50 years ago.

129
00:06:13.467 --> 00:06:16.000
After which he left
the entire place to the town.

130
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.433
Lucky us.

131
00:06:18.433 --> 00:06:21.934
Roisin Ballydonal? The founder
of the matchmaking festival.

132
00:06:21.934 --> 00:06:23.300
Someone's done her homework.

133
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.633
Well. I'm nothing
if not well-researched.

134
00:06:25.633 --> 00:06:28.266
Then you'll know that she set up
the festival on the grounds here

135
00:06:28.266 --> 00:06:30.633
for the farmers to meet
young women in the spring.

136
00:06:30.633 --> 00:06:33.133
And the tradition stuck.

137
00:06:33.133 --> 00:06:35.500
So. um. why is there
nothing going on here

138
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.834
for the festival right now?

139
00:06:36.834 --> 00:06:39.333
Oh. these days
we only use the house

140
00:06:39.333 --> 00:06:40.834
for the big party at the end.

141
00:06:40.834 --> 00:06:42.467
Don't wanna wear her out.

142
00:06:42.467 --> 00:06:44.700
-[clattering]
-Oh.

143
00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.333
We need to get that fixed.

144
00:06:48.433 --> 00:06:50.967
Among other things.

145
00:06:50.967 --> 00:06:53.033
Um... OK. well.
thank you so much.

146
00:06:53.033 --> 00:06:55.667
And I'm...
I'm sorry to interrupt.

147
00:06:55.667 --> 00:06:58.100
I'll let you...
I'll let you get to it.

148
00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.333
Enjoy your stay.

149
00:07:16.667 --> 00:07:17.867
[Lindsey] OK.

150
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:22.967
Thank you.

151
00:07:28.667 --> 00:07:31.033
You'll be in our back cottage.
It's lovely.

152
00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:33.700
You can hear the greenfinches
chirping in the morning.

153
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.100
But we also have earplugs
in case you need them.

154
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.934
Jetlag can be rough
the first few days.

155
00:07:37.934 --> 00:07:40.233
and we want our guests
feeling good for the festival.

156
00:07:40.233 --> 00:07:41.867
Oh. I'm not here
for the festival.

157
00:07:41.867 --> 00:07:45.033
I know. probably one of the only
people in town who isn't.

158
00:07:45.033 --> 00:07:46.934
I'm giving a presentation
to the council.

159
00:07:46.934 --> 00:07:48.533
which I should get to work on.

160
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.500
There we go.

161
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.533
Now. you're through
the back door and down the path.

162
00:07:53.533 --> 00:07:57.834
-Can I give you a hand?
-No. no. I've got it. thank you.

163
00:07:57.834 --> 00:08:00.500
[woman] It's official.
I brought way too many clothes.

164
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.467
Well. I didn't bring enough.
so we'll share.

165
00:08:02.467 --> 00:08:04.133
I've got mine up for grabs. too.

166
00:08:04.133 --> 00:08:07.066
Hi! Aren't your sunnies cute?

167
00:08:07.066 --> 00:08:10.500
Oh. thank you. I got them
from a sample sale in New York.

168
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.266
-You're from New York?
-Where are you from?

169
00:08:12.266 --> 00:08:15.266
Australia. Though we usually get
mistaken for New Zealanders.

170
00:08:15.266 --> 00:08:18.567
I'm Charlotte.
This is Kylie and Olivia.

171

-I'm Lindsey. Nice to meet you.

-Oh! I'd love to.

and I wouldn't want to intrude.

175

No. please. It's always more fun
with a fourth.

176
00:08:31.834 --> 00:08:33.900
Um... OK. Sure. Why not?

Well. the first few days.

based on the questionnaire
you fill out.

The hope is you find a match.

185
00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.800
OK. I don't mean
to sound like a skeptic.

186
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.734

that hundreds of people

I am an acquisitions manager

in buying Ballydonal Castle

here. ladies.

I wasn't trying to be sneaky.

205
00:09:43.834 --> 00:09:46.734
I've done a lot of research
and I have a very good argument

206
00:09:46.734 --> 00:09:48.967
as to why my company
should acquire the castle.

207
00:09:48.967 --> 00:09:50.567

to the ground?

to try and woo the council.

no matter what your offer is.

to your matchmaking festival.

But we also understand

00:13:10.333 --> 00:13:12.200
that it's in need
of some major renovations.

in Kilabbey?

putting in the time and effort.

and maybe then
they will reconsider our offer.

334

is your specialty.

335

You've always had very good
instincts about deals.

-But this seems pretty...
-Unorthodox?

337
00:15:55.533 --> 00:15:58.300
Yeah. I know. I know.
But they have to see me

338
00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.433
as something other
than a hotel developer.

339
00:16:00.433 --> 00:16:02.300

to our side of things.

341
00:16:04.533 --> 00:16:08.967
Mr. Krispen. I'm telling you.
this property is one of a kind.

342
00:16:08.967 --> 00:16:12.266
If you were here.
you would do the same thing.

343
00:16:12.266 --> 00:16:15.934
-OK. Keep me updated.
-OK. thanks.

344
00:16:15.934 --> 00:16:18.700
You mean the same woman from
the council meeting this morning

345
00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.266
is doing the festival?

346
00:16:20.266 --> 00:16:21.700
That's the one.

347
00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:23.767
Maybe she'll meet a nice bloke.

348
00:16:23.767 --> 00:16:26.066
I don't think that's her aim.
Rory.

349
00:16:26.066 --> 00:16:28.767
So what if she hangs out
for a week?

350
00:16:28.767 --> 00:16:30.800
She'll learn some kayaking.
eat some boxty.

351
00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.433
sing some Irish songs.

352
00:16:32.433 --> 00:16:34.567
Doesn't mean we have to sell
the land to her. does it?

353
00:16:34.567 --> 00:16:36.200
No. I suppose not.

354
00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.233
Who knows? Maybe she won't
even like the festival.

355
00:16:38.233 --> 00:16:39.767
head back to the States.

356
00:16:39.767 --> 00:16:41.767
This isn't exactly
New York City.

357
00:16:43.233 --> 00:16:44.900
We'll see how she gets on.

358
00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:55.567
So in order to give our soda
bread that nice crumbly texture.

359
00:16:55.567 --> 00:16:58.734
we're going to incorporate
the butter in like this.

360
00:16:58.734 --> 00:17:01.533
We're getting right in there.
that's it. Gorgeous.

361
00:17:01.533 --> 00:17:03.400
Yes. right in there. Mix it.

362
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.033
I've never had one of my guests

363
00:17:05.033 --> 00:17:06.567
bring their own
pastry cutter before.

364
00:17:06.567 --> 00:17:09.800
Oh. yeah. yeah. I. um...
I read that it helps.

365
00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.300
so my innkeeper
let me borrow it.

366
00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:14.000
I use the same methods
my grandmother used.

367
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.500
And her grandmother before that.

368
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.300
A fork usually suffices.

369
00:17:19.834 --> 00:17:22.633
Really are trying to impress.
aren't you?

370
00:17:22.633 --> 00:17:25.333
Are you...
Are you even allowed back there?

371
00:17:27.133 --> 00:17:29.200
I'm dropping off
some festival stuff for Maebh.

372
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.667
and picking up
some chocolate biscuits.

373
00:17:31.667 --> 00:17:33.533
If you haven't checked out
their bakery display.

374
00:17:33.533 --> 00:17:36.367
it's really very impressive.
You're missing out.

375
00:17:36.367 --> 00:17:38.633
I highly recommend
the lemon tart.

376
00:17:38.633 --> 00:17:40.834
Thank you so much
for the recommendation.

377
00:17:50.066 --> 00:17:52.066
Good luck with the bread.

378
00:17:52.066 --> 00:17:56.000
Remember not to overknead it.
You probably already knew that.

379
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.800
[Maebh] The color is just
beautiful on all of these.

380
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.266
Do you mind if I try?

381
00:18:03.266 --> 00:18:05.567
This is gorgeous-looking.
this one. That's it.

382
00:18:05.567 --> 00:18:09.233
And when it's nice and warm as
well. cos then you've got...

383
00:18:09.233 --> 00:18:10.433
Mm.

384
00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:14.767
Not what you're used to?

385
00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:17.567
No. no. it's delicious.

386
00:18:17.567 --> 00:18:19.033
[chuckles]

387
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.567
-[whistle blowing]
-[indistinct shouting]

388
00:18:24.567 --> 00:18:27.967
Remember. you can play the ball
on the ground and in the air!

389
00:18:27.967 --> 00:18:31.066
-[players chatting]
-Very good.

390
00:18:33.133 --> 00:18:35.867
One over two. right cross.

391
00:18:37.266 --> 00:18:38.567
Trust me...

392
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.300
-[Brennan] Player.
-Out of my way.

393
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:45.266
...you'll get into
the rhythm of the cable stitch.

394
00:18:45.266 --> 00:18:47.467
[whispers] Excuse me.
do you know what you're doing?

395
00:18:47.467 --> 00:18:50.867
-It's purl three.
-Right. purl three.

396
00:18:50.867 --> 00:18:52.934
[overlapping chatter]

397
00:18:54.266 --> 00:18:55.934
-[blows whistle]
-What?

398
00:18:55.934 --> 00:18:57.934
-Three to The Matchmakers!
-I must be doing purl two.

399
00:18:57.934 --> 00:18:59.900
She took the ball
and she put one hand...

400
00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.934
-You said that...
-Didn't see anything.

401
00:19:01.934 --> 00:19:03.333
Or five?

402
00:19:03.333 --> 00:19:04.967
Whatever this thing is.
she had her hands on it.

403
00:19:04.967 --> 00:19:07.300
It's a clear violation
according to what you taught me.

404
00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:10.100
I play by the rules.
And I'm an excellent study. sir.

405
00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:11.367
You're the one who taught me.

406
00:19:11.367 --> 00:19:12.867
There you go.
Abusing the referee.

407
00:19:12.867 --> 00:19:15.133
-Yellow card.
-Give me all your cards.

408
00:19:16.166 --> 00:19:17.467
Siobhan?

409
00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.600
Oh. that looks great.

410
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.834
May be best if you start over.

411
00:19:25.266 --> 00:19:26.767
Right.

412
00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.433
Go. go. go!

413
00:19:29.433 --> 00:19:30.500
[players cheering]

414
00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.533
-No goal.
-Whoo! What?

415
00:19:32.533 --> 00:19:34.967
-No goal. Play on.
-That's three points!

416
00:19:39.467 --> 00:19:42.133
-Took too many steps.
-I didn't take too many steps!

417
00:19:42.133 --> 00:19:44.700
I put the ball on the stick
and the stick into the net.

418
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.033
You are a little bit biased.

419
00:19:46.033 --> 00:19:48.500
-Took many steps.
-Three points to my team!

420
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.533
Lindsey... go and have a coffee.

421
00:19:50.533 --> 00:19:52.333
Or go make some bread.

422
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.667
Bye!

423
00:19:55.767 --> 00:19:57.266
[Lindsey] Fine.

424
00:19:59.867 --> 00:20:01.900
-[knock on door]
-Come in.

425
00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.633
-Fancy a biscuit?
-Ooh. yeah.

426
00:20:12.533 --> 00:20:14.033
Thank you.

427
00:20:14.033 --> 00:20:16.166
So. what's on the docket
for tomorrow?

428
00:20:16.166 --> 00:20:20.166
OK. kayaking in the morning.
then bo...

429
00:20:20.166 --> 00:20:23.033
-Bodhrán.
-...bodhrán drum after that.

430
00:20:23.033 --> 00:20:25.367
and then intro to Irish beer.

431
00:20:25.367 --> 00:20:28.166
I just really. really.
really hope

432
00:20:28.166 --> 00:20:30.600
that tomorrow runs smoother
than today.

433
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.967
It can always be a little bumpy.
settling in. I remember.

434
00:20:33.967 --> 00:20:36.467
Seamus and I actually met at
the festival. a long time ago.

435
00:20:36.467 --> 00:20:37.600
In a cooking class.

436
00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.600
-Really?
-Yeah.

437
00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.333
Our pie turned out terrible.

438
00:20:40.333 --> 00:20:42.433
but we actually got something
out of it in the end.

439
00:20:42.433 --> 00:20:44.100
Yeah. I'd say.

440
00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.934
Are you going to stop by
the festival gathering tonight?

441
00:20:45.934 --> 00:20:48.934
Oh. no. No. I feel like
that's for people

442
00:20:48.934 --> 00:20:51.200
that are really trying
to find their match.

443
00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.166
No. it's for everyone.
Sure. Seamus and I even go.

444
00:20:54.166 --> 00:20:56.533
once he's done with
the dinner dishes. [chuckles]

445
00:20:56.533 --> 00:20:59.133
Look. it's one thing
reading about Ireland.

446
00:20:59.133 --> 00:21:02.233
It's another to actually get out
and experience it.

447
00:21:09.433 --> 00:21:11.600
-[Celtic fiddle playing]
-[door closes]

448
00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.400
[overlapping chatter]

449
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.400
I hope we get some classes
together this week.

450
00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.266
Me. too. I'm trying to sign up
for as many things as I can.

451
00:21:19.266 --> 00:21:21.333
You should go paddleboarding
and bicycling

452
00:21:21.333 --> 00:21:22.867
if there's still spots.

453
00:21:22.867 --> 00:21:24.867
We went today
and it was a beaut.

454
00:21:24.867 --> 00:21:29.066
Although one of us did wipe out
with a gentle wave.

455
00:21:29.066 --> 00:21:30.667
[laughter]

456
00:21:30.667 --> 00:21:33.033
Luckily. our strapping
young instructor was there

457
00:21:33.033 --> 00:21:34.667
to help Olivia back up.

458
00:21:34.667 --> 00:21:37.567
He was very sweet about it.

459
00:21:37.567 --> 00:21:39.100
Watch us become
some of those ladies

460
00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:41.934
that come back every year
with matching T-shirts.

461
00:21:41.934 --> 00:21:44.400
You can stay at
the Ballydonal Resort and Spa.

462
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.100
-That is. if it ever gets made.
-Here. here.

463
00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.700
-Cheers to the Ballydonal.
-To Ballydonal.

464
00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:51.300
Yes. indeed.

465
00:21:59.033 --> 00:22:03.066
She stayed for the entire class
although I barely helped her.

466
00:22:03.066 --> 00:22:05.266
I almost feel a bit bad
for the girl.

467
00:22:05.266 --> 00:22:08.333
Her soda bread looked like
it tasted awful.

468
00:22:08.333 --> 00:22:12.567
Well. that was me.
I may have added a bit of salt.

469
00:22:12.567 --> 00:22:15.400
-A lot. actually.
-[laughter]

470
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.133
-You're terrible.
-I'm not terrible.

471
00:22:17.133 --> 00:22:19.867
I just want people to be at the
festival for the right reasons.

472
00:22:24.667 --> 00:22:28.333
-[mic feedback]
-Tráthnóna maith. [laughs]

473
00:22:28.333 --> 00:22:30.233
-Welcome to the festival.
-[people hushing]

474
00:22:30.233 --> 00:22:32.100
We're all very glad you're here.

475
00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:35.600
Now. we're going to start off
with a céilí dance.

476
00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.166
a traditional Irish folk dance.

477
00:22:38.166 --> 00:22:40.133
[loud cheering]

478
00:22:40.133 --> 00:22:43.300
[applause]

479
00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:46.100
[folk music playing]

480
00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:48.500
-I'm gonna go ask Rory to dance.
-Yes. you are.

481
00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.233
You. come with me. Come on!

482
00:22:52.834 --> 00:22:55.567
[clapping in time with music]

483
00:22:55.567 --> 00:22:57.100
[laughs]

484
00:23:05.633 --> 00:23:08.500
[cheering]

485
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:20.333
[laughter]

486
00:23:27.533 --> 00:23:30.367
-Not feeling the music?
-I don't dance.

487
00:23:30.367 --> 00:23:31.834
I find that hard to believe

488
00:23:31.834 --> 00:23:33.500
based on your moves
with the broom.

489
00:23:36.133 --> 00:23:38.300
[clapping continues]

490
00:23:48.734 --> 00:23:50.166
[laughs]

491
00:24:00.266 --> 00:24:01.934
[cheering]

492
00:24:06.066 --> 00:24:07.567
[laughs]

493
00:24:12.433 --> 00:24:14.600
Welcome.

494
00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:15.934
I should be welcoming you.

495
00:24:15.934 --> 00:24:18.934
I thought you'd be
back in your room.

496
00:24:18.934 --> 00:24:21.433
studying for your classes
tomorrow.

497
00:24:21.433 --> 00:24:24.200
And miss this authentic
Irish tradition?

498
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:26.533
No way. Oh!

499
00:24:26.533 --> 00:24:27.900
It's called having the craic.

500
00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:29.400
Didn't that come up
in your research?

501
00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.266
You know what?
I will crash and burn all week

502
00:24:32.266 --> 00:24:34.967
if it means I get another chance
to meet with everyone.

503
00:24:34.967 --> 00:24:37.433
I hope you won't leave here
disappointed.

504
00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.734
I usually don't.

505
00:24:40.734 --> 00:24:42.867
[music. clapping continue]

506
00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:52.100
Let me guess. you watched céilí
videos before you came over.

507
00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.867
Oh. no. This is all me.

508
00:24:55.867 --> 00:24:59.200
[cheering. whistling]

509
00:25:14.467 --> 00:25:17.834
[Alroy talks indistinctly]

510
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.200
[Alroy laughs]

511
00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.667
Mr. Sprows. Good morning.

512
00:25:23.667 --> 00:25:25.433
Ah. Ms. Johnson.

513
00:25:25.433 --> 00:25:28.834
I don't believe we've ever had a
presenter from a council meeting

514
00:25:28.834 --> 00:25:30.333
sign up for the festival.

515
00:25:30.333 --> 00:25:31.967
I took your advice to heart.

516
00:25:31.967 --> 00:25:35.000
It's important that I get
a good sense of the area.

517
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.934
Yes. well. I hope you'll leave
with a good impression.

518
00:25:38.934 --> 00:25:41.300
I'm very excited to take
your class this morning.

519
00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:42.967
It's the first time
I've been kayaking.

520
00:25:42.967 --> 00:25:45.133
Oh. right. Yes. well...

521
00:25:45.133 --> 00:25:49.333
I don't seem to have you
on my list.

522
00:25:49.333 --> 00:25:52.200
-We must have overbooked...
-Overbooked?

523
00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.633
...which happens sometimes.

524
00:25:54.633 --> 00:25:57.100
Oh. yes. we like to rotate
now and then.

525
00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.433
you know.
keep things on the move.

526
00:25:59.433 --> 00:26:03.066
I'm sure Doyle O'Brien will
have you for his cooking class.

527
00:26:03.066 --> 00:26:06.433
OK. Maybe there's
another option.

528
00:26:06.433 --> 00:26:07.867
Clearly baking wasn't my thing.

529
00:26:07.867 --> 00:26:11.400
Oh. nonsense.
You'll be grand. [laughs]

530
00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:15.066
How are the numbers looking?

531
00:26:15.066 --> 00:26:16.900
Attendance is even higher
than last year.

532
00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:18.433
Oh. great.

533
00:26:18.433 --> 00:26:20.266
But Alroy's still going
to have to call a meeting

534
00:26:20.266 --> 00:26:21.900
after the festival.

535
00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:23.367
We'll have a deficit
in the town's operating budget

536
00:26:23.367 --> 00:26:25.100
and we need to make more cuts.

537
00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:27.433
We've made so many already.
Are you sure?

538
00:26:27.433 --> 00:26:30.600
We've been over the numbers
a million times.

539
00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.600
Everything just costs more
than it used to.

540
00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:37.567
I know we'd all like to fix up
part of the castle this year.

541
00:26:37.567 --> 00:26:39.667
but we can't even get to that.

542
00:26:46.567 --> 00:26:48.900
-I'm not much of a cook.
-You'll be great.

543
00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:51.400
-So. 11 o'clock sharp.
-OK. see you then.

544
00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.700
OK. bye-bye.

545
00:26:54.533 --> 00:26:57.200
All set. Dad? You need anything
before I head off?

546
00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.867
I've got an odd number again.

547
00:27:00.834 --> 00:27:05.233
Any way you can stay. partner up
with somebody for a bit?

548
00:27:05.233 --> 00:27:06.934
You'll get a free lunch
out of it.

549
00:27:08.133 --> 00:27:11.266
-Sure.
-Good man.

550
00:27:11.266 --> 00:27:14.667
My Irish stew is a little bit
different every time.

551
00:27:14.667 --> 00:27:17.100
based on what's in the garden.

552
00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:21.100
You've got your traditional
meat. onions. potatoes. carrots.

553
00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:26.400
but maybe I add a few cabbage
leaves. or some leeks.

554
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.900
OK. let's get cracking.

555
00:27:31.467 --> 00:27:34.266
You know my dad isn't
on the town council.

556
00:27:34.266 --> 00:27:36.133
Yeah. I know.

557
00:27:36.133 --> 00:27:39.300
I was supposed to be in Alroy's
class. but it was overbooked.

558
00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.433
Oh. Sorry to hear that.

559
00:27:41.433 --> 00:27:44.467
No. I'm glad to be
in this class.

560
00:27:44.467 --> 00:27:48.266
It's good that I'm learning
a few authentic Irish recipes.

561
00:27:48.266 --> 00:27:50.767
I've got a little Irish in me.

562
00:27:50.767 --> 00:27:51.900
That explains it.

563
00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.533
-The stubbornness.
-[laughs]

564
00:27:55.567 --> 00:27:57.767
My 20-year-old whiskey will be
ready before this stew

565
00:27:57.767 --> 00:27:59.934
the way you're cutting that.
Do you want to switch?

566
00:27:59.934 --> 00:28:03.166
No. thank you. I'm good.
I gotta learn.

567
00:28:03.166 --> 00:28:06.800
The majority of my cooking
in the last few years

568
00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:10.000
has been in a microwave. so...

569
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.300
All those fancy dinners
in New York?

570
00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:15.633
If you call eating takeout
at your desk fancy. then yes.

571
00:28:15.633 --> 00:28:18.734
-Depends on the desk. I guess.
-[laughs]

572
00:28:18.734 --> 00:28:23.633
Look. not everyone's dad has
a famous Irish stew.

573
00:28:23.633 --> 00:28:26.700
It's never too late to learn.
but I'm genuinely terrified

574
00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.633
at what you're doing
to that carrot.

575
00:28:28.633 --> 00:28:29.867
-Put it down.
-I'm peeling it.

576
00:28:29.867 --> 00:28:31.967
-Put it on the board.
-OK.

577
00:28:31.967 --> 00:28:34.166
I don't want you to lose your
fingers. So. knuckles there.

578
00:28:34.166 --> 00:28:35.867
-My knuckles?
-Yeah.

579
00:28:35.867 --> 00:28:37.333
Then press down.

580
00:28:39.333 --> 00:28:42.166
[indistinct chatter.
cutlery clinking]

581
00:28:42.166 --> 00:28:44.333
So. Lindsey. what's the verdict?

582
00:28:44.333 --> 00:28:46.000
It's delicious.

583
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.533
And you said you couldn't cook.

584
00:28:47.533 --> 00:28:50.066
[laughs]
Well. I had a good partner.

585
00:28:50.066 --> 00:28:52.233
[scoffs]

586
00:28:52.233 --> 00:28:54.233
So. what brings everyone
to the festival this year?

587
00:28:54.233 --> 00:28:55.834
Uh. well. it's funny.

588
00:28:55.834 --> 00:28:58.467
Laura and I both came last year.
on our own.

589
00:28:58.467 --> 00:29:00.900
just looking to have
an adventure in Ireland.

590
00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:03.767
-And we found each other.
-What?

591
00:29:03.767 --> 00:29:07.266
Turns out we lived just
15 minutes apart in Chicago.

592
00:29:07.266 --> 00:29:10.967
We even went to the same gym.
but we'd never met.

593
00:29:10.967 --> 00:29:13.600
And actually we came back
this year to elope.

594
00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.700
-You don't say!
-What?

595
00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:18.567
-Congratulations!
-[laughter]

596
00:29:18.567 --> 00:29:21.400
You visit once and Ireland's
a hard place to forget.

597
00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.300
[Laura] It is. [giggles]

598
00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:24.533
So. how about you?

599
00:29:24.533 --> 00:29:26.200
Oh. um...

600
00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:30.700
Well. I... I came here
a week ago for business.

601
00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:34.767
and. um... I just decided
to stay.

602
00:29:34.767 --> 00:29:36.066
[laughs] So...

603
00:29:36.066 --> 00:29:37.800
Normally. when I travel.
it's for work.

604
00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.200
so there's not really time
for sightseeing or excursions.

605
00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:44.433
There's really not time
for anything. so...

606
00:29:44.433 --> 00:29:48.433
I don't know. this time.
I've been able to be here.

607
00:29:48.433 --> 00:29:52.400
and. um.
just get to know the people.

608
00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:55.100
It's... It has been really nice.

609
00:29:58.867 --> 00:30:02.266
[Alroy] Robin. meet Jenna.

610
00:30:02.266 --> 00:30:03.367
[knocks door]

611
00:30:03.367 --> 00:30:07.133
And Laela. meet Vlad.

612
00:30:07.133 --> 00:30:09.233
-Yeah. there we go.
-Sorry to interrupt. Alroy.

613
00:30:09.233 --> 00:30:10.900
Siobhan asked me
to get you to sign these.

614
00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.400
-Right.
-Orders to get the fence mended.

615
00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.767
-How are the activities going?
-Good.

616
00:30:17.133 --> 00:30:20.900
Are we going to have to sell
the castle. Alroy? And the land?

617
00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:24.633
Well. I don't know. Maybe.

618
00:30:24.633 --> 00:30:27.867
But I want to hold off on that
for as long as we can.

619
00:30:27.867 --> 00:30:32.600
I know Ms. Johnson is anxious
for us to change our minds.

620
00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:36.300
Well. she's more than welcome
to make us another offer.

621
00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:41.433
and we're more than welcome
to say no.

622
00:30:41.433 --> 00:30:45.433
The thing is. I'm finding it
difficult to get her a match.

623
00:30:45.433 --> 00:30:50.200
A match? For Lindsey? I don't
think she's expecting one.

624
00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.800
Everyone gets a match. Brennan.

625
00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:55.867
Of course. we know
that they don't always take.

626
00:30:57.066 --> 00:31:01.567
Perhaps the right person
will emerge.

627
00:31:03.533 --> 00:31:06.900
I wouldn't hold your breath.
Thanks.

628
00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:13.800
[children chatter]

629
00:31:17.533 --> 00:31:20.200
Well. if it isn't the guardian
of the castle.

630
00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.400
And if it isn't
the trespassing American.

631
00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:25.533
More of your Irish studies?

632
00:31:25.533 --> 00:31:27.800
No. your dad lent me this.

633
00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.834
I thought I'd copy a few recipes
down to make when I get home.

634
00:31:32.266 --> 00:31:34.100
More tidying up of the castle?

635
00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:37.533
I have quite a few things left
on my list before the party.

636
00:31:37.533 --> 00:31:39.667
-Need a hand?
-Is that a trick question?

637
00:31:39.667 --> 00:31:43.500
No. No. I would love to help.
I...

638
00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.834
Selfishly. I'd love
to see more of the castle.

639
00:31:45.834 --> 00:31:49.133
-I'd love a hand.
-OK.

640
00:31:50.834 --> 00:31:52.900
[gentle music]

641
00:31:54.033 --> 00:31:56.700
-You all right?
-Yeah. I'm good.

642
00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:58.100
Sure?
We can take a break if you want.

643
00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:01.734
-No. I'm fine.
-[clatters]

644
00:32:01.734 --> 00:32:03.367
We'll just add that to the list.

645
00:32:03.367 --> 00:32:05.033
-I'm sorry.
-It's OK.

646
00:32:11.233 --> 00:32:13.667
-Right. OK?
-Yeah.

647
00:32:13.667 --> 00:32:15.967
-Thank you.
-Of course.

648
00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:21.667
So. when you're not tending
to the castle.

649
00:32:21.667 --> 00:32:26.200
or the pub. or matters
of the town council...

650
00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:28.600
-I make whiskey.
-Oh.

651
00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:30.266
And that's it.

652
00:32:30.266 --> 00:32:32.767
I went to university
to study business.

653
00:32:32.767 --> 00:32:35.533
and then I came back to help
my mum and dad when I was done.

654
00:32:35.533 --> 00:32:38.500
Hmm. Have you always enjoyed
working with your family?

655
00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:42.934
I have. I've even brought in
some revolutionary ideas.

656
00:32:42.934 --> 00:32:44.667
They now take
credit card payments.

657
00:32:44.667 --> 00:32:46.533
[laughs]

658
00:32:46.533 --> 00:32:48.166
What about you?

659
00:32:48.166 --> 00:32:52.233
Have you always worked
for a fancy resort company?

660
00:32:52.233 --> 00:32:54.000
Shockingly. yes.

661
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.333
I moved to New York City
after school

662
00:32:56.333 --> 00:32:57.667
to try and work at a museum

663
00:32:57.667 --> 00:33:00.500
because I studied
design and architecture.

664
00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.567
and I got a temp job
at The Krispen Group

665
00:33:03.567 --> 00:33:04.900
and I never left.

666
00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:07.700
Turns out I'm really good
at closing deals.

667
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.467
So my life has become

668
00:33:11.467 --> 00:33:14.800
about landing one in every
major city in the world.

669
00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.667
Kilabbey must be high
on your list. so.

670
00:33:16.667 --> 00:33:19.333
-[chuckles]
-It is.

671
00:33:19.333 --> 00:33:23.100
This is one of the most
beautiful places I've ever seen.

672
00:33:24.767 --> 00:33:27.433
Do you want to see the best view
from this castle?

673
00:33:27.433 --> 00:33:28.600
Yes.

674
00:33:35.834 --> 00:33:37.800
I used to come up here
when I was a kid.

675
00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.667
Sneak up. keep an eye on things.

676
00:33:39.667 --> 00:33:42.333
So you've been guarding the
castle for quite some time now.

677
00:33:42.333 --> 00:33:44.467
Oh. yeah.

678
00:33:44.467 --> 00:33:46.567
I've had to let a couple
of things go over the years.

679
00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.166
Wild picnics.

680
00:33:50.166 --> 00:33:53.934
Rowdy and... sometimes
some nosy tourists.

681
00:33:55.467 --> 00:33:57.967
And a certain household neglect
that results

682
00:33:57.967 --> 00:34:01.967
-in disintegrating bannisters.
-Oh. gosh.

683
00:34:01.967 --> 00:34:04.033
I just hate the idea
of this all disappearing.

684
00:34:05.633 --> 00:34:07.333
All that history gone.

685
00:34:08.633 --> 00:34:09.867
You're connected to it.

686
00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:17.667
Well. I should get back to work.

687
00:34:17.667 --> 00:34:20.100
as much as I'd like to pretend
like I'm on vacation.

688
00:34:22.133 --> 00:34:23.467
Thanks for showing me this spot.

689
00:34:23.467 --> 00:34:24.967
You're welcome.
Thank you for your help.

690
00:34:24.967 --> 00:34:27.200
Next time. we'll rehang
all the chandeliers.

691
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.934
You got it.

692
00:34:33.133 --> 00:34:36.000
[Ellie] How's Operation
Charm The Town Council going?

693
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.233
[sighs] Honestly? I don't know.

694
00:34:39.233 --> 00:34:41.333
I haven't been spent any time
with the head councilman.

695
00:34:41.333 --> 00:34:42.800
but I am determined
to leave here

696
00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.900
with more than just
some conversational Irish

697
00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:46.667
and a bodhrán drum.

698
00:34:46.667 --> 00:34:48.066
So that matchmaking festival
plan sounds perfect.

699
00:34:48.066 --> 00:34:49.900
You can do research.
ask some questions.

700
00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:52.367
and maybe even meet
a cute Irish guy.

701
00:34:52.367 --> 00:34:54.667
Wait. have you met
a cute Irish guy?

702
00:34:54.667 --> 00:34:56.800
-No.
-[gasps] You totally have!

703
00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.200
Tell me everything.

704
00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.300
[sighs] As much as
you would like to picture

705
00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:02.900
some idyllic Irish romance
unfolding over here.

706
00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:04.367
nothing is happening. Ellie.

707
00:35:04.367 --> 00:35:05.600
[line beeps]

708
00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.200
Oh. you're getting saved
by another call.

709
00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.233
It's that UK company
that wants to collaborate

710
00:35:09.233 --> 00:35:11.100
on the Allen group.
or I would not be taking it.

711
00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:13.100
I'll talk to you later.

712
00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:14.567
At which point you will spill
about what's really going on.

713
00:35:14.567 --> 00:35:15.900
OK. [laughs]

714
00:35:33.266 --> 00:35:36.000
Right. that's nearly everyone.

715
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.633
We're just missing...

716
00:35:39.033 --> 00:35:40.800
Sorry. I'm late.

717
00:35:47.133 --> 00:35:49.100
Is. uh. this seat taken?

718
00:35:50.467 --> 00:35:53.133
-No. go ahead.
-Thanks.

719
00:35:58.867 --> 00:36:00.400
I hear
it's a bit of a long ride.

720
00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.867
Oh.

721
00:36:02.867 --> 00:36:05.900
I'd say we are in
for some rolling hills.

722
00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:09.367
You know. real kinda. like.
landscape. vista territory.

723
00:36:09.367 --> 00:36:10.700
I look forward to it.

724
00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:12.367
I mean. the greens here
are just...

725
00:36:12.367 --> 00:36:14.734
They're. like. richer
than you'd see anywhere else.

726
00:36:14.734 --> 00:36:17.100
-[door closes]
-I wonder how they irrigate it.

727
00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:18.300
-Me too.
-Yeah.

728
00:36:21.367 --> 00:36:22.834
What people don't realize

729
00:36:22.834 --> 00:36:26.367
is the mulch industry
is very competitive.

730
00:36:26.367 --> 00:36:27.734
Oh. I did not realize that.

731
00:36:27.734 --> 00:36:31.667
Oh. yeah.
Totally different than topsoil.

732
00:36:31.667 --> 00:36:33.367
-I'm glad I got in while I did.
-Yeah.

733
00:36:33.367 --> 00:36:35.233
[Brennan] Cliffs of Moher.
coming up ahead!

734
00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:44.633
-There we go.
-Thank you.

735
00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:02.700
You know we're at the "find your
match" portion of the festival?

736
00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.467
Just curious
as to why you came today.

737
00:37:06.467 --> 00:37:08.533
I wanted to see the cliffs.

738
00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:13.900
OK. so. aside from being
incredibly beautiful.

739
00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:15.767
tell me about them.

740
00:37:15.767 --> 00:37:18.600
There has to be some sort of
Irish folklore attached

741
00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.000
to a place this magical.

742
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.133
Oh. yes.

743
00:37:22.133 --> 00:37:26.233
Legend has it that these cliffs
have a mystical power

744
00:37:26.233 --> 00:37:28.433
that attracts
every single American tourist.

745
00:37:28.433 --> 00:37:31.300
[laughs]

746
00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:35.967
So no pirates. mermaids
or star-crossed lovers?

747
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.233
There is one.

748
00:37:39.266 --> 00:37:41.600
Woman named Mal.

749
00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:44.500
She was chasing
her one true love.

750
00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:46.767
the great warrior Cú Chulainn.

751
00:37:46.767 --> 00:37:49.767
Sadly. she couldn't catch him.

752
00:37:49.767 --> 00:37:52.100
Her sorrow was so great
that she turned to stone.

753
00:37:53.934 --> 00:37:58.600
If you look closely. you can
just make out her profile.

754
00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:03.633
Still staring out to sea.
watching. waiting for him.

755
00:38:05.066 --> 00:38:06.433
Is that true?

756
00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.700
A little bit yes.
a little bit no.

757
00:38:11.533 --> 00:38:15.467
Oh. guys. I remembered from
earlier it's really important

758
00:38:15.467 --> 00:38:17.900
you invest in the right kind
of product if you're gonna...

759
00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:20.567
Would you like a photo
with your seat-mate?

760
00:38:20.567 --> 00:38:22.266
Who. Grant the mulch guy?

761
00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.367
Nah. Since we're soulmates

762
00:38:27.367 --> 00:38:30.400
and we're gonna be together
for the rest of our lives...

763
00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:33.333
we can wait
till the next photo op.

764
00:38:33.333 --> 00:38:34.433
Fair enough.

765
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.667
So. does Alroy
tell you the matches?

766
00:38:40.667 --> 00:38:43.734
Oh. no. Only Alroy knows.

767
00:38:43.734 --> 00:38:47.333
Sometimes they don't work out.
Things get criss-crossed.

768
00:38:49.867 --> 00:38:51.333
Wait. were you ever matched?

769
00:38:51.333 --> 00:38:55.700
Yes. I was. actually.
I was even engaged.

770
00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:59.967
But it didn't work out.

771
00:38:59.967 --> 00:39:03.266
I thought she wanted to
stay in Ireland. but she didn't.

772
00:39:03.266 --> 00:39:04.934
I'm sorry.

773
00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:08.233
It's OK.

774
00:39:08.233 --> 00:39:11.633
I'm quite happy to hang back
and to facilitate.

775
00:39:11.633 --> 00:39:14.000
Actually. you get quite good
at your own predictions.

776
00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:16.700
That couple there.

777
00:39:19.033 --> 00:39:23.100
She's gonna touch his hand
right about... now.

778
00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:27.400
You're good.

779
00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:30.133
Um. OK... What about them?

780
00:39:30.133 --> 00:39:33.867
So. the website is mulch.co.uk.
which I know sounds basic...

781
00:39:33.867 --> 00:39:38.200
They... are really
hitting it off.

782
00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.633
Except for Grant.

783
00:39:39.633 --> 00:39:42.233
Oh. And what about Grant?

784
00:39:42.233 --> 00:39:44.633
-Grant is going to be alone.
-[laughs]

785
00:39:44.633 --> 00:39:46.700
Till he works
on his conversation skills.

786
00:39:49.533 --> 00:39:51.400
Can I show you my favorite spot?

787
00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:53.200
Yeah.

788
00:39:54.767 --> 00:39:57.200
[seagulls squawk]

789
00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:05.734
-Hey. Da.
-Hey.

790
00:40:05.734 --> 00:40:07.266
I'm almost done here.

791
00:40:07.266 --> 00:40:08.934
then I can help
with prep for the dinner rush.

792
00:40:08.934 --> 00:40:11.300
No need. Your mam came in early
to get a head start.

793
00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:13.367
You know this week
is like Christmas for her

794
00:40:13.367 --> 00:40:14.767
with all the guests coming in.

795
00:40:14.767 --> 00:40:16.734
She should enjoy the crowds
while they last.

796
00:40:16.734 --> 00:40:18.300
Yeah.

797
00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:21.400
Oh... Tom Murray stopped by
yesterday.

798
00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:22.700
said you weren't interested

799
00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:24.567
in expanding the whiskey venture
with him.

800
00:40:24.567 --> 00:40:26.066
We've been through this.

801
00:40:26.066 --> 00:40:28.133
I'm happy doing
the smaller batches for the pub.

802
00:40:28.133 --> 00:40:30.467
I've enough to focus on
for the rest of the year.

803
00:40:30.467 --> 00:40:32.300
I don't have the time.

804
00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:34.800
You know. we could manage if
you were out a few days a week.

805
00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.533
I appreciate that.

806
00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.533
But I'm all right. really.

807
00:41:06.367 --> 00:41:09.066
[noisy chatter]

808
00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:20.000
Hi.

809
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.667
I was wondering
if you might stop by.

810
00:41:21.667 --> 00:41:24.300
Yeah. well. I was out for
a walk and I heard some music.

811
00:41:25.834 --> 00:41:28.834
-Is it like this every day?
-Day and night.

812
00:41:28.834 --> 00:41:31.100
It seems
like you could use a hand.

813
00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:32.734
Wanna jump behind the bar?

814
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.333
-Yeah.
-All right.

815
00:41:36.333 --> 00:41:38.400
-Come on. so.
-[chuckles]

816
00:41:41.533 --> 00:41:43.600
-Cheers.
-Thank you.

817
00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:45.834
Two for you now?

818
00:41:45.834 --> 00:41:48.700
Aren't you a love to help us.

819
00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:50.367
Well. I don't know
how qualified I am.

820
00:41:50.367 --> 00:41:52.166
but I'm happy to be of service.

821
00:41:52.166 --> 00:41:53.934
Your whiskey is so popular.

822
00:41:53.934 --> 00:41:55.834
People come from
all over the coast

823
00:41:55.834 --> 00:41:57.967
to taste Brennan's house blend.

824
00:41:57.967 --> 00:42:00.734
Oh. is that right?
It's just a hobby.

825
00:42:00.734 --> 00:42:02.700
Suddenly so modest. this one.

826
00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:06.533
I hope you know you'll be
helping yourself

827
00:42:06.533 --> 00:42:08.066
to dinner and dessert tonight.

828
00:42:08.066 --> 00:42:10.033
Oh. no. Nora. I can't do that.

829
00:42:10.033 --> 00:42:11.700
And they'll have it.

830
00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:14.900
You'll hurt my mam's feelings
if you don't say yes.

831
00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:16.233
I see they've turned Ms. Johnson

832
00:42:16.233 --> 00:42:18.100
into a regular employee
up there.

833
00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:22.033
Oh. is that so? [chuckles]

834
00:42:22.033 --> 00:42:24.367
She's been a good guest
the last few days. Alroy.

835
00:42:24.367 --> 00:42:26.033
I'm willing to be
as welcoming to her

836
00:42:26.033 --> 00:42:27.500
as we are to
the rest of the group.

837
00:42:35.367 --> 00:42:38.567
Well. it's customary
to have a whiskey lesson

838
00:42:38.567 --> 00:42:39.767
before you start serving it.

839
00:42:39.767 --> 00:42:41.500
Mm-hm.

840
00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:43.333
Maybe we can
make up for that now

841
00:42:43.333 --> 00:42:45.967
with a little... tasting.

842
00:42:47.767 --> 00:42:50.200
Why don't I just try
some of yours?

843
00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:00.767
Whoo!

844
00:43:02.066 --> 00:43:05.667
OK...
that's a little strong for me.

845
00:43:05.667 --> 00:43:06.967
[they laugh]

846
00:43:06.967 --> 00:43:09.734
Hold on.
We'll find you the right one.

847
00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.734
So. how did you
get into whiskey anyway?

848
00:43:14.734 --> 00:43:18.500
It's in the blood.
This pub is an old distillery.

849
00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.300
Halfway between
Belfast and Cork.

850
00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:22.100
A place where a weary traveler
could come

851
00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:25.934
and have a glass of something
to warm their bones.

852
00:43:25.934 --> 00:43:30.100
And personally.
I quite like the process.

853
00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:33.133
We age our whiskey
for a minimum of eight years.

854
00:43:33.133 --> 00:43:35.767
so you have to be patient.

855
00:43:35.767 --> 00:43:38.800
And when you do
come back to it...

856
00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:40.900
...it's like meeting up
with an old friend.

857
00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:42.266
Worth the wait.

858
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.600
Mm. I'm getting... fruit?

859
00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:56.233
-Yep.
-Yeah?

860
00:43:56.233 --> 00:43:59.233
More delicate. It's a newer
blend from a sherry cask.

861
00:44:02.834 --> 00:44:04.100
-Let's try one more.
-OK.

862
00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:19.900
Mm. This is my favorite.

863
00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:24.367
It's...
It's sweet and... smooth.

864
00:44:27.166 --> 00:44:28.800
My very first batch.

865
00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:33.400
What happens
when you run out of it?

866
00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:37.133
You have a toast.
sing a couple of old folk songs.

867
00:44:38.467 --> 00:44:40.166
Only fitting.

868
00:44:40.166 --> 00:44:42.800
I like that there's
a history to it.

869
00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:45.934
A beginning. middle. and end.

870
00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:50.900
-You should bartend more often.
-[they laugh]

871
00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:52.000
Maybe so.

872
00:44:53.333 --> 00:44:55.300
[Nora]
A hand with the dishes. Brennan?

873
00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:56.633
Yeah. be right there.

874
00:45:00.066 --> 00:45:03.367
Enjoy that. You earned it.

875
00:45:12.533 --> 00:45:14.700
Oíche mhaith.

876
00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:16.333
Oíche mhaith.

877
00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:29.100
Oíche mhaith.s squawk]

878
00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:32.033
I think the coffee shop's
around the corner.

879
00:45:32.033 --> 00:45:34.467
Oh. I forgot they're doing
speed dating this morning.

880
00:45:34.467 --> 00:45:37.800
Oh. my God. you guys.
we totally have to jump in.

881
00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.600
Oh. no. no. You girls go ahead.

882
00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:41.600
I have to go to the council
office to make an appointment.

883
00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:44.633
Oh. no. no. no. Come with us.
It'll be fast and fun.

884
00:45:48.333 --> 00:45:50.867
OK. OK. why not?

885
00:45:50.867 --> 00:45:52.433
[giggles]

886
00:45:52.433 --> 00:45:55.834
Then there's video games.
and football.

887
00:45:55.834 --> 00:45:58.166
and obviously water sports.

888
00:45:58.166 --> 00:46:00.567
-I collect vintage trains.
-Oh.

889
00:46:00.567 --> 00:46:03.900
That is a lot of interests.
[laughs]

890
00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:05.867
Um. well. my name's Lindsey
and. um...

891
00:46:05.867 --> 00:46:07.500
[bell rings]

892
00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:08.567
[man] Next circle!

893
00:46:10.734 --> 00:46:12.867
I think you should
talk about your dachshunds.

894
00:46:12.867 --> 00:46:15.667
But maybe about what you like
to do with them. activity wise.

895
00:46:15.667 --> 00:46:17.233
Give people
a better sense of you.

896
00:46:17.233 --> 00:46:18.734
Do you think I messed up
earlier?

897
00:46:18.734 --> 00:46:20.667
I did get carried away
about naming them.

898
00:46:20.667 --> 00:46:24.367
-Not at all. You're doing great.
-[bell rings]

899
00:46:28.533 --> 00:46:30.100
I didn't take you
as a speed dater.

900
00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:32.667
-Mm. You either.
-I'm not.

901
00:46:32.667 --> 00:46:34.500
I'm here this morning
as a coach.

902
00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:36.233
-Gentle words of encouragement.
-Yeah.

903
00:46:36.233 --> 00:46:38.600
Well. I hope you're a better
coach at this than hurling.

904
00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.734
I sincerely hope
you're better at flirting

905
00:46:40.734 --> 00:46:43.166
than you are at hurling.

906
00:46:43.166 --> 00:46:45.166
Well. we have
about 45 seconds left.

907
00:46:45.166 --> 00:46:49.166
Do you want to tell me
about bad habits. deal breakers?

908
00:46:49.166 --> 00:46:51.900
Deal breakers? This is moving
really fast for me.

909
00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:54.867
When you only have one minute.
you've gotta double down.

910
00:46:54.867 --> 00:46:56.834
OK. um... deal breakers.

911
00:46:59.333 --> 00:47:02.900
-Bad dancers.
-[they laugh]

912
00:47:04.967 --> 00:47:06.767
Oh. Oh. no.

913
00:47:12.934 --> 00:47:14.967
-Let's make a run for it.
-No. we can't.

914
00:47:14.967 --> 00:47:16.567
Uh. yes. we can.

915
00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:21.867
[bell rings]

916
00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:24.266
[they laugh]

917
00:47:24.266 --> 00:47:26.834
Thank you so "mulch"
for doing that.

918
00:47:26.834 --> 00:47:28.900
I couldn't put you
through that again.

919
00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:30.467
-No.
-Consider it a public service.

920
00:47:30.467 --> 00:47:32.400
Although we did leave
a lot of people to suffer.

921
00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:33.667
We did.

922
00:47:33.667 --> 00:47:35.100
I thought it was
"mulch" more important

923
00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:37.433
-that we got you away.
-[laughs]

924
00:47:39.333 --> 00:47:41.600
Would you like to join me
on an errand?

925
00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:45.300
Yeah.

926
00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:47.133
[bell rings]

927
00:47:55.567 --> 00:47:57.400
So. how much whiskey
will this make?

928
00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:59.934
Uh. enough. I'm not so precise.

929
00:47:59.934 --> 00:48:01.633
[chuckles] Fair enough.

930
00:48:03.033 --> 00:48:04.066
Hey.

931
00:48:04.066 --> 00:48:06.000
Need a hand. Brennan?

932
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.100
Oh. no. I'm grand. thanks.
Aoife. I have a helper today.

933
00:48:11.367 --> 00:48:13.633
Aoife's great.

934
00:48:13.633 --> 00:48:15.033
When she's not working
on the farm.

935
00:48:15.033 --> 00:48:16.834
she does work
for the National Archives.

936
00:48:16.834 --> 00:48:20.467
She set up a whole database
for small town records.

937
00:48:22.467 --> 00:48:24.367
Do you think she could
help me with something?

938
00:48:24.367 --> 00:48:25.767
Of course.

939
00:48:27.734 --> 00:48:32.967
Hmm. Nothing's coming up
for Ina Muireann Duffy.

940
00:48:32.967 --> 00:48:35.633
You said she would have
been born about 1920?

941
00:48:35.633 --> 00:48:37.333
Yeah.

942
00:48:37.333 --> 00:48:38.800
I'm not seeing anything.

943
00:48:40.867 --> 00:48:43.633
Let's try Agnes
as the first name.

944
00:48:43.633 --> 00:48:46.867
It's another form of Ina
here in Ireland.

945
00:48:46.867 --> 00:48:51.967
Bingo! This looks like her.
Born 1921 in Glendalough.

946
00:48:51.967 --> 00:48:54.300
I'm guessing this is
her childhood address.

947
00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:57.033
Not far away.
just over the hill. I'd say.

948
00:48:57.033 --> 00:48:58.867
Do you think there's
any chance that we could...

949
00:48:58.867 --> 00:49:01.300
Go there immediately?
Definitely happening.

950
00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:02.934
[laughs]

951
00:49:02.934 --> 00:49:04.700
Thank you so much.

952
00:49:09.033 --> 00:49:12.667
[Brennan] Now... should be...

953
00:49:14.734 --> 00:49:16.667
[Brennan] ...just here.
after the church.

954
00:49:19.433 --> 00:49:20.934
Are you sure this is right?

955
00:49:20.934 --> 00:49:23.033
This is where the house
is supposed to be?

956
00:49:23.033 --> 00:49:24.500
I believe so.

957
00:49:26.533 --> 00:49:27.867
This is it.

958
00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:33.266
-Must have been torn down.
-So sorry. Lindsey.

959
00:49:33.266 --> 00:49:35.200
I didn't know.

960
00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:37.367
It's not...
it's not your fault.

961
00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:40.934
I'm glad we came.

962
00:49:42.767 --> 00:49:46.467
-We can go back now.
-No.

963
00:49:46.467 --> 00:49:51.133
Well. her house may be gone.
You can see where she's from.

964
00:49:51.133 --> 00:49:53.200
Why don't we walk
where she would have?

965
00:49:57.133 --> 00:50:00.033
This is officially what we call
in Ireland a soft day.

966
00:50:00.033 --> 00:50:02.734
[Lindsey laughs]

967
00:50:02.734 --> 00:50:06.734
This area was founded in
the sixth century by St. Kevin.

968
00:50:06.734 --> 00:50:09.333
There's history everywhere
you step foot.

969
00:50:10.767 --> 00:50:12.266
He was a hermit.

970
00:50:12.266 --> 00:50:14.200
Legend has it that he was
so at one with nature.

971
00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:18.700
so at peace with himself.
that when he would meditate...

972
00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:20.533
...he'd put his hands out.
and he'd be so still

973
00:50:20.533 --> 00:50:22.934
that once a bird came.
landed in his hand

974
00:50:22.934 --> 00:50:24.767
and made a nest.

975
00:50:24.767 --> 00:50:26.700
He lived till he was 120.

976
00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:27.934
Is that true?

977
00:50:28.967 --> 00:50:30.400
Little bit yes. little bit no.

978
00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:33.200
[chuckles]

979
00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:35.400
There's a place you should see
that way.

980
00:50:39.367 --> 00:50:43.000
I imagine her walking
on this exact same path.

981
00:50:44.066 --> 00:50:45.300
Oh!

982
00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:48.033
And maybe tripping
on that exact same spot.

983
00:50:48.033 --> 00:50:50.300
-Are you OK?
-Yeah. I'm fine.

984
00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:52.467
I'm so jealous
of all this beauty

985
00:50:52.467 --> 00:50:54.233
that she got to see every day.

986
00:50:54.233 --> 00:50:56.900
The most greenery I see
is a succulent.

987
00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:58.967
Probably going to be dead
when I get home.

988
00:50:58.967 --> 00:51:01.133
[chuckles]

989
00:51:01.133 --> 00:51:04.000
So you didn't get any tips
from Grant. then?

990
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.367
You think he'll give me
a discount

991
00:51:05.367 --> 00:51:07.033
on one of those window boxes?

992
00:51:07.033 --> 00:51:09.133
Pretty sure he'd give you
plenty of things for free.

993
00:51:09.133 --> 00:51:10.633
[both laugh]

994
00:51:10.633 --> 00:51:12.333
You know. we aren't too far
from the ocean.

995
00:51:14.867 --> 00:51:17.800
How many hotels do you think
you've built around the world?

996
00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:22.100
I don't know. Maybe 50?
A hundred?

997
00:51:23.166 --> 00:51:26.266
Well. is it 50 or 100?

998
00:51:26.266 --> 00:51:28.667
Well. it's not like
I built them myself.

999
00:51:28.667 --> 00:51:30.033
I just manage the acquisition.

1000
00:51:30.033 --> 00:51:31.934
then move on
to the next project.

1001
00:51:31.934 --> 00:51:33.166
Ah.

1002
00:51:34.433 --> 00:51:35.867
What about you?

1003
00:51:35.867 --> 00:51:38.166
How many batches of whiskey
have you made?

1004
00:51:38.166 --> 00:51:40.967
Hundreds. Thousands.

1005
00:51:40.967 --> 00:51:44.467
Well. what is it?
Hundreds or thousands?

1006
00:51:44.467 --> 00:51:46.767
The one that makes me
sound less like a fanatic.

1007
00:51:49.333 --> 00:51:52.100
Why don't you make that
your main gig?

1008
00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:56.500
I mean. the demand's there.
And you seem to love it.

1009
00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:59.600
Ah. it'd be too expensive
and time-consuming.

1010
00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:03.600
I like my set-up now.

1011
00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:06.967
Besides. things get less fun
when they get so official.

1012
00:52:08.233 --> 00:52:11.767
My job's official. I have fun.

1013
00:52:11.767 --> 00:52:14.100
OK. well.
not all parts of it are fun.

1014
00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:19.100
but it would be nice to
be more a part of the process.

1015
00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:20.667
stay in one place long enough

1016
00:52:20.667 --> 00:52:23.133
to see a hotel be built
from start to finish.

1017
00:52:24.233 --> 00:52:26.367
Beginning. middle and end.

1018
00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:31.433
Well. for what it's worth.

1019
00:52:31.433 --> 00:52:33.033
I think you'd be
really great at it.

1020
00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:42.233
-[knock at door]
-[Alroy] Come in.

1021
00:52:42.233 --> 00:52:43.633
Ah. Ms. Johnson.

1022
00:52:44.834 --> 00:52:46.333
I hope I'm not interrupting.

1023
00:52:50.667 --> 00:52:53.867
Well. I think I know
why you're here.

1024
00:52:53.867 --> 00:52:56.767
I'd like to request a spot
at Saturday's council meeting.

1025
00:52:56.767 --> 00:52:58.567
I'd be grateful for 15 minutes

1026
00:52:58.567 --> 00:53:00.233
with time for questions after.

1027
00:53:00.233 --> 00:53:02.900
So you're going to give us
another presentation?

1028
00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:05.467
I've made several changes
to the proposal

1029
00:53:05.467 --> 00:53:08.300
and I really hope
that you give me another chance.

1030
00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:10.400
Would you like to come
for a little walk?

1031
00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:12.667
Sure.

1032
00:53:12.667 --> 00:53:16.967
My late wife was
an American too.

1033
00:53:16.967 --> 00:53:18.800
Very pragmatic.

1034
00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:21.333
She could make
a convincing argument.

1035
00:53:21.333 --> 00:53:23.066
just like you.

1036
00:53:23.066 --> 00:53:25.400
Is it hard doing the festival
without her?

1037
00:53:26.667 --> 00:53:29.100
I look forward to it every year.

1038
00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:31.066
Which is what she would want.

1039
00:53:31.066 --> 00:53:34.633
Oh. she loved Ballydonal Castle.

1040
00:53:34.633 --> 00:53:38.300
But if she were here right now.
she would tell me to sell it.

1041
00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:39.667
Really?

1042
00:53:39.667 --> 00:53:41.600
Yes. she'd say
it's a lucrative deal.

1043
00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:43.433
could take care of the town
for years.

1044
00:53:43.433 --> 00:53:47.100
No more stress making cuts.
trying to fill deficits.

1045
00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:49.633
worries about falling behind.

1046
00:53:49.633 --> 00:53:51.100
At the end of the day.

1047
00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:53.333
it's a building
we're talking about.

1048
00:53:53.333 --> 00:53:55.467
She would just want to make sure

1049
00:53:55.467 --> 00:53:58.433
that we were selling it
to the right person.

1050
00:54:01.533 --> 00:54:03.467
I understand.

1051
00:54:03.467 --> 00:54:07.900
We're no closer
to restoring the castle

1052
00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:09.633
and I'm not getting any younger

1053
00:54:09.633 --> 00:54:12.734
to try and find a way
to save it.

1054
00:54:12.734 --> 00:54:16.834
So. let's talk exactly

1055
00:54:16.834 --> 00:54:19.367
about what a sale would entail.

1056
00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:30.900
Of course I want them
to sell us the castle.

1057
00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:32.600
And the town needs the money.

1058
00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:36.133
But if Alroy convinces the
council to go through with this.

1059
00:54:36.133 --> 00:54:38.133
I'm going to be responsible
for taking down

1060
00:54:38.133 --> 00:54:39.467
an irreplaceable landmark

1061
00:54:39.467 --> 00:54:41.166
that so many people
are attached to.

1062
00:54:41.166 --> 00:54:43.734
and some people's livelihoods
depend on.

1063
00:54:43.734 --> 00:54:46.667
like I'm some evil villain.

1064
00:54:46.667 --> 00:54:48.300
And Brennan may never
talk to me again.

1065
00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:51.066
Oh. dreamy Irish guy.
There is that.

1066
00:54:51.066 --> 00:54:53.567
Just tell me that this is my job
and I'm doing my job

1067
00:54:53.567 --> 00:54:55.100
and everybody will win here.

1068
00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:57.433
This is your job
and you're doing your job.

1069
00:54:57.433 --> 00:54:58.834
Everyone's going to win here.

1070
00:54:58.834 --> 00:55:01.066
including me
once this espresso kicks in.

1071
00:55:01.066 --> 00:55:02.867
I'm sorry. I know it's early.

1072
00:55:02.867 --> 00:55:04.500
Don't be. You've got this.

1073
00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:06.033
OK. Bye.

1074
00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:12.400
[Brennan] If you like her.
then you should tell her.

1075
00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:14.133
What if she's not interested?

1076
00:55:14.133 --> 00:55:16.867
Believe me. she's interested.

1077
00:55:16.867 --> 00:55:18.500
Have you not seen the way
she looks at you

1078
00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:20.200
when you're not looking?

1079
00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:23.233
Oh. No. I don't suppose
you have.

1080
00:55:23.233 --> 00:55:25.066
If I were you.
I'd get some flowers

1081
00:55:25.066 --> 00:55:27.133
and go and tell her
how you feel.

1082
00:55:27.133 --> 00:55:29.567
You mean right now?

1083
00:55:29.567 --> 00:55:31.166
Might as well.

1084
00:55:31.166 --> 00:55:32.867
There's only two days left
of the festival. Rory.

1085
00:55:32.867 --> 00:55:34.100
No time to waste.

1086
00:55:36.667 --> 00:55:37.867
Right.

1087
00:55:44.633 --> 00:55:46.734
What was that about?

1088
00:55:46.734 --> 00:55:47.800
A girl.

1089
00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:50.333
Ah. I see.

1090
00:55:52.667 --> 00:55:55.066
Sounds like you're having
a nice week yourself.

1091
00:55:55.066 --> 00:55:56.700
Dad. it's no big deal.

1092
00:55:56.700 --> 00:56:00.533
I know.
it's none of our business.

1093
00:56:00.533 --> 00:56:03.667
But we'd love for you to find
happiness with someone again.

1094
00:56:05.033 --> 00:56:06.834
Whenever you're ready. son.

1095
00:56:17.433 --> 00:56:20.367
[Brennan] What are you
doing here?

1096
00:56:20.367 --> 00:56:22.100
I thought you were on that trip
this morning.

1097
00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:23.934
Sorry. I didn't make it.
I. um...

1098
00:56:23.934 --> 00:56:25.767
Well. Alroy wanted me to come in

1099
00:56:25.767 --> 00:56:27.367
and go over my presentation
with him.

1100
00:56:27.367 --> 00:56:28.567
Oh.

1101
00:56:30.266 --> 00:56:33.233
It wasn't my idea. He...

1102
00:56:33.233 --> 00:56:35.734
He wanted to go over
the deal points.

1103
00:56:37.266 --> 00:56:39.033
He said that he was going
to talk

1104
00:56:39.033 --> 00:56:41.700
to the other council members
about it later today.

1105
00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:43.367
So he is interested in selling?

1106
00:56:45.266 --> 00:56:47.233
When were you going
to tell me this?

1107
00:56:48.767 --> 00:56:52.433
As soon as I got the courage
to walk over to the pub.

1108
00:56:55.266 --> 00:56:57.600
I know how much this castle
means to you. Brennan.

1109
00:56:57.600 --> 00:56:59.767
-[scoffs]
-And to everyone here. I...

1110
00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:05.100
But Alroy said
that the town needs the money.

1111
00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:06.633
And this deal?

1112
00:57:06.633 --> 00:57:08.500
This could take care
of all of Kilabbey's needs

1113
00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:10.967
for the foreseeable future.

1114
00:57:10.967 --> 00:57:13.633
All of our needs
except the castle.

1115
00:57:13.633 --> 00:57:15.266
Because it'll be gone.

1116
00:57:15.266 --> 00:57:19.200
I promise you that the council
members will have input.

1117
00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:21.734
This resort will reflect
the history here.

1118
00:57:22.967 --> 00:57:25.467
Because it's time for a change.

1119
00:57:25.467 --> 00:57:27.333
Building a new history together.
Wasn't that it?

1120
00:57:27.333 --> 00:57:28.934
Do you think it's going to be
easy for me

1121
00:57:28.934 --> 00:57:32.367
to sign off on demolishing
the castle?

1122
00:57:32.367 --> 00:57:35.467
This is the only deal that I
have ever wanted to pull out of

1123
00:57:35.467 --> 00:57:37.066
and that's...

1124
00:57:40.333 --> 00:57:41.667
That's because of you.

1125
00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:51.533
[footsteps approach]

1126
00:57:51.533 --> 00:57:54.633
Brennan. why don't you come in
and we'll have a chat.

1127
00:58:04.834 --> 00:58:07.133
[children playing]

1128
00:58:26.834 --> 00:58:29.367
You all know as well as I do

1129
00:58:29.367 --> 00:58:32.367
that we can't afford
a major renovation.

1130
00:58:32.367 --> 00:58:35.500
We've been struggling to even
balance our operation budgets

1131
00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:39.033
these past few years.
It's an impossible undertaking.

1132
00:58:39.033 --> 00:58:41.200
The Krispen Group's offer
is more than generous

1133
00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:43.834
compared with those
we've received in the past.

1134
00:58:43.834 --> 00:58:44.934
And there's something to be said

1135
00:58:44.934 --> 00:58:46.533
for the fact that
Lindsey's stayed

1136
00:58:46.533 --> 00:58:49.400
for the best part of a week
to get to know the area.

1137
00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:51.834
-And us.
-So what does this mean?

1138
00:58:51.834 --> 00:58:55.600
We're all attached
to the castle.

1139
00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:59.033
But I think it's time to do
what's right for the moment.

1140
00:58:59.033 --> 00:59:04.767
Sell now to someone who will
take our opinions into account.

1141
00:59:04.767 --> 00:59:06.133
Hmm?

1142
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.467
[phone rings]

1143
00:59:13.734 --> 00:59:15.400
[Krispen] Hello?

1144
00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:18.400
Mr. Krispen. hi. it's Lindsey.

1145
00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:21.066
I'm so glad that I got you.
I have some updates.

1146
00:59:21.066 --> 00:59:23.633
I'm coming to Dublin.

1147
00:59:23.633 --> 00:59:25.467
Oh. wait. Dublin. Ireland?

1148
00:59:25.467 --> 00:59:28.667
There's a similar property
for sale right on the water.

1149
00:59:28.667 --> 00:59:31.133
A few structures to tear down.

1150
00:59:31.133 --> 00:59:33.066
but no town council
to deal with.

1151
00:59:33.066 --> 00:59:34.900
I'm already on my way
to Helsinki.

1152
00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:36.333
so I figured I could stop over.

1153
00:59:36.333 --> 00:59:38.000
take a look
for a couple of days.

1154
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:42.300
We only need one resort
in Ireland to get us going.

1155
00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:45.600
So you're deciding between
Kilabbey and Dublin?

1156
00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:48.600
Well. that depends. How are
things coming along down there?

1157
00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:51.266
Well. I just had a meeting
with the head councilman.

1158
00:59:51.266 --> 00:59:53.767
and he seems willing to sell.

1159
00:59:53.767 --> 00:59:55.767
He just has to talk
to the other council members.

1160
00:59:55.767 --> 00:59:58.166
get them on board and they
usually vote in line with him.

1161
00:59:58.166 --> 01:00:01.633
so this deal could be done
as early as the weekend.

1162
01:00:01.633 --> 01:00:04.500
Excellent. Well. once I speak
with the Dublin team.

1163
01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:07.567
let's connect and we can decide
which one to pursue.

1164
01:00:07.567 --> 01:00:10.266
OK. I've got to go now
because my flight's going.

1165
01:00:10.266 --> 01:00:11.900
OK. great. well.
we'll talk then.

1166
01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:13.734
Yeah. OK. Got to go.

1167
01:00:26.667 --> 01:00:30.934
So Mr. Krispen is deciding
between your property

1168
01:00:30.934 --> 01:00:33.033
and a coastal site in Dublin.

1169
01:00:33.033 --> 01:00:34.867
I really want him
to choose yours

1170
01:00:34.867 --> 01:00:36.800
because I know the town
could use the money.

1171
01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.000
but I also completely understand

1172
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.433
if you want to wait
a little longer

1173
01:00:40.433 --> 01:00:41.834
to see if someone will come by

1174
01:00:41.834 --> 01:00:44.867
and want to buy the land
and keep the castle.

1175
01:00:44.867 --> 01:00:46.500
We already voted yesterday.
Lindsey.

1176
01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:50.834
We approved to move ahead
with the sale. We're ready.

1177
01:00:50.834 --> 01:00:55.133
OK. I will do my best
to try to convince Mr. Krispen

1178
01:00:55.133 --> 01:00:56.467
that Kilabbey is the way to go.

1179
01:00:56.467 --> 01:00:59.967
Well. um.
I'd better get to the castle.

1180
01:00:59.967 --> 01:01:02.066
I've got a wedding to perform.

1181
01:01:02.066 --> 01:01:04.400
Wait. you perform
wedding ceremonies too?

1182
01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:05.900
What don't you do for this town?

1183
01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:09.767
Well. you know.
after matching a lot of couples.

1184
01:01:09.767 --> 01:01:11.934
they suddenly started
asking me to marry them.

1185
01:01:11.934 --> 01:01:14.834
So I quite enjoy it.

1186
01:01:14.834 --> 01:01:18.700
Actually. I do need a witness.

1187
01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:20.166
Or two?

1188
01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:24.867
And may you live
in a blessed home.

1189
01:01:24.867 --> 01:01:26.400
protected in your marriage.

1190
01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:30.066
gentle and faithful.
one in your love.

1191
01:01:30.066 --> 01:01:32.367
and kept in peace.

1192
01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:35.233
You may kiss the bride.

1193
01:01:35.233 --> 01:01:36.467
[they laugh]

1194
01:01:38.033 --> 01:01:39.533
[applause]

1195
01:01:39.533 --> 01:01:41.834
What number marriage is this
for you. Alroy?

1196
01:01:41.834 --> 01:01:44.333
3.474.

1197
01:01:44.333 --> 01:01:46.033
Let's make it official.

1198
01:01:48.734 --> 01:01:51.533
-Congratulations.
-Thanks!

1199
01:01:53.433 --> 01:01:55.000
Your ring is so beautiful.

1200
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.166
I have one like it.
The Claddagh ring.

1201
01:01:57.166 --> 01:02:00.467
Oh. Justin and I picked it out
together yesterday.

1202
01:02:00.467 --> 01:02:01.900
What's the symbolism again?

1203
01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:05.133
Uh. the heart represents love.

1204
01:02:05.133 --> 01:02:07.734
The hands represent friendship.

1205
01:02:07.734 --> 01:02:10.433
And the crown represents
loyalty.

1206
01:02:10.433 --> 01:02:12.133
And the way you wear it
also means something.

1207
01:02:12.133 --> 01:02:14.066
You're wearing yours
on your left hand

1208
01:02:14.066 --> 01:02:16.834
because you're married now.
with the ring facing inwards.

1209
01:02:16.834 --> 01:02:19.667
But you can also wear it
outward.

1210
01:02:19.667 --> 01:02:21.967
that your heart is open.
looking for love.

1211
01:02:21.967 --> 01:02:24.500
Or your heart is taken because
you're in a relationship.

1212
01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:29.300
Well. my heart
is definitely taken.

1213
01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:31.133
How are you celebrating
for the rest of the day?

1214
01:02:31.133 --> 01:02:33.800
We are going to have dinner
at the restaurant where we met.

1215
01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:36.834
And then we're going to stay
at this tiny little inn

1216
01:02:36.834 --> 01:02:38.667
right on the water.

1217
01:02:38.667 --> 01:02:40.967
It's almost like we're staying
on a boat attached to an inn.

1218
01:02:40.967 --> 01:02:42.600
That sounds so special.

1219
01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:44.767
Yeah. it is. It's like
the blending of two worlds.

1220
01:02:44.767 --> 01:02:46.533
The old and the new.

1221
01:02:47.567 --> 01:02:50.467
That's it.

1222
01:02:50.467 --> 01:02:55.066
Thank you so much for letting us
be a part of your special day.

1223
01:02:55.066 --> 01:02:57.567
The castle will be
the front of the resort

1224
01:02:57.567 --> 01:02:59.934
and then we'll build onto it.

1225
01:02:59.934 --> 01:03:02.667
That's what will make it
a better sale than Dublin.

1226
01:03:02.667 --> 01:03:04.633
That's what will make people
want to come and stay.

1227
01:03:04.633 --> 01:03:06.367
There'll be no other place
like it.

1228
01:03:06.367 --> 01:03:08.834
I appreciate you wanting
to incorporate the castle.

1229
01:03:08.834 --> 01:03:12.734
but I know it's not practical
and ridiculously expensive.

1230
01:03:12.734 --> 01:03:14.867
But a lot of castles
have been made into hotels.

1231
01:03:14.867 --> 01:03:16.900
and they're popular.
They make money.

1232
01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:19.166
I really think Mr. Krispen
can be convinced

1233
01:03:19.166 --> 01:03:22.667
to go in a different direction
if we just merge the ideas.

1234
01:03:23.734 --> 01:03:25.033
But what if he says no?

1235
01:03:25.033 --> 01:03:27.467
Well. it's worth pitching him.

1236
01:03:27.467 --> 01:03:30.133
I can make up a proposal based
on projections of other castles

1237
01:03:30.133 --> 01:03:32.967
that have been renovated
to commercial use.

1238
01:03:32.967 --> 01:03:35.033
Ask if he'll come to the party
tomorrow night.

1239
01:03:35.033 --> 01:03:37.133
The place will be all lit up.
people celebrating.

1240
01:03:37.133 --> 01:03:38.900
You'll be able to see
how incredible it is

1241
01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:40.533
and pitch it to him then.

1242
01:03:40.533 --> 01:03:42.266
It's perfect.

1243
01:03:43.633 --> 01:03:45.734
We're going to need
a lot of help.

1244
01:03:45.734 --> 01:03:48.600
-With what?
-How do I put this nicely?

1245
01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:53.166
The castle needs
a major facelift.

1246
01:03:53.166 --> 01:03:54.734
She doesn't look that bad.
does she?

1247
01:03:54.734 --> 01:03:57.400
OK. you also have to stop
referring to her as a she

1248
01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:02.066
or my boss is never going to
take this seriously.

1249
01:04:02.066 --> 01:04:06.133
All right.
But she's not going to like it.

1250
01:04:06.133 --> 01:04:08.033
and I believe
that the Kilabbey property

1251
01:04:08.033 --> 01:04:09.700
is better in every way.

1252
01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:12.567
In Dublin. we would be competing
against existing hotels

1253
01:04:12.567 --> 01:04:15.367
that offer a similar level of
service at the same price point.

1254
01:04:15.367 --> 01:04:17.300
Dublin does have higher tourism.

1255
01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:19.300
But Kilabbey has
unobstructed views.

1256
01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:20.633
And it's driving distance

1257
01:04:20.633 --> 01:04:22.266
from numerous
historical landmarks.

1258
01:04:22.266 --> 01:04:23.900
They also have
the matchmaking festival.

1259
01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:26.033
which brings in 1.000 people
every year.

1260
01:04:26.033 --> 01:04:27.967
many who make return trips.

1261
01:04:27.967 --> 01:04:29.433
And you said yourself.

1262
01:04:29.433 --> 01:04:31.233
we would be the only
upscale lodging option

1263
01:04:31.233 --> 01:04:33.033
for 100 miles.

1264
01:04:33.033 --> 01:04:35.600
The team in Dublin already has
a relationship with vendors.

1265
01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:37.900
an expedited process
for permitting.

1266
01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:41.533
there's infrastructure here.
which counts for a lot.

1267
01:04:41.533 --> 01:04:43.867
Come to Kilabbey. Mr. Krispen.

1268
01:04:43.867 --> 01:04:45.400
The festival party
is tomorrow night

1269
01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:46.734
and you can see for yourself

1270
01:04:46.734 --> 01:04:48.433
just how indescribable
this place is.

1271
01:04:48.433 --> 01:04:50.967
I've seen the pictures. Lindsey.

1272
01:04:50.967 --> 01:04:53.633
A picture cannot capture
what it feels like

1273
01:04:53.633 --> 01:04:55.900
to actually experience
this place.

1274
01:04:56.934 --> 01:04:59.066
All right. I'll come.

1275
01:04:59.066 --> 01:05:00.734
You won't be sorry.

1276
01:05:04.033 --> 01:05:06.600
-He's in!
-Ah. that's brilliant.

1277
01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:10.000
Right. Rory. you and I
are in charge of touch-ups

1278
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.467
and handiwork inside the castle.

1279
01:05:11.467 --> 01:05:13.433
Do you think Olivia
and the girls might help?

1280
01:05:13.433 --> 01:05:15.800
I bet Seamus and Adelia
would pitch in too.

1281
01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:18.667
Alroy. you and Siobhan
are in charge of landscaping.

1282
01:05:18.667 --> 01:05:20.467
Connor will help
taking the old plants out

1283
01:05:20.467 --> 01:05:22.033
and putting new ones in.

1284
01:05:22.033 --> 01:05:23.600
And Maebh. you are in charge
of visual frosting.

1285
01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:25.200
So anything you can add

1286
01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:28.033
to the decor that you already
have planned. go for it.

1287
01:05:28.033 --> 01:05:31.300
We have one chance
to make a big impression.

1288
01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:32.800
All right. guys.
let's get to it.

1289
01:05:34.967 --> 01:05:38.433
OK. I'll go prepare my document
with all the projections.

1290
01:05:38.433 --> 01:05:40.533
Let's hope your boss
goes for this crazy idea.

1291
01:05:40.533 --> 01:05:42.166
I know.

1292
01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:51.633
Has anyone got floodlights?

1293
01:05:51.633 --> 01:05:53.600
-Floodlights are coming.
-Good man.

1294
01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:55.700
And we've got more champers.

1295
01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:58.000
And I've got fuel for everyone.

1296
01:06:00.867 --> 01:06:02.066
Really?

1297
01:06:02.066 --> 01:06:03.367
Oh. sorry.

1298
01:06:05.367 --> 01:06:07.166
-[laughs]
-Oh. really. Ms. Johnson?

1299
01:06:07.166 --> 01:06:08.867
What?

1300
01:06:08.867 --> 01:06:10.433
-That's Grant's nightmare.
-What are you talking about?

1301
01:06:10.433 --> 01:06:12.033
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1302
01:06:12.033 --> 01:06:14.767
OK. stop. We have way too much
work to do

1303
01:06:14.767 --> 01:06:17.233
for you to be tying me up
like this.

1304
01:06:17.233 --> 01:06:18.633
Goodness.

1305
01:06:20.233 --> 01:06:22.567
So. let's say this all works.

1306
01:06:22.567 --> 01:06:24.667
What do you think the Grand Room
will be turned into?

1307
01:06:24.667 --> 01:06:25.934
Mm! I don't know.

1308
01:06:25.934 --> 01:06:28.433
Maybe a dining area?
Or a lounge?

1309
01:06:28.433 --> 01:06:31.200
-It won't be a spa. no?
-Absolutely not!

1310
01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:32.934
There should definitely be
a bar. though.

1311
01:06:32.934 --> 01:06:34.233
With old timey drinks.

1312
01:06:34.233 --> 01:06:36.066
You could serve
Brennan's whiskey.

1313
01:06:36.066 --> 01:06:38.867
-That's a good idea!
-[Rory] Good luck with that.

1314
01:06:38.867 --> 01:06:41.400
This guy has loads of offers
from investors

1315
01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.000
to distribute his whiskey.

1316
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.700
and he still insists
on keeping it a small batch.

1317
01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:47.266
Why is that?

1318
01:06:47.266 --> 01:06:49.700
The truck has just arrived
with more lights.

1319
01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:51.934
-Could I have a hand?
-I'll give you a hand.

1320
01:06:51.934 --> 01:06:53.367
You guys stay here.

1321
01:06:58.934 --> 01:07:02.433
[birdsong]

1322
01:07:06.567 --> 01:07:08.767
[typing on keyboard]

1323
01:07:08.767 --> 01:07:10.033
[knocking]

1324
01:07:11.767 --> 01:07:15.600
If those are more of those
poppy seed biscuits. Seamus.

1325
01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:19.767
I appreciate the thought. but
I have absolutely overdone it.

1326
01:07:22.767 --> 01:07:24.100
Hi.

1327
01:07:25.633 --> 01:07:26.767
Hi.

1328
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.100
-Are you finished?
-That'd be a no.

1329
01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:35.333
But I figured we could have
an early dinner.

1330
01:07:35.333 --> 01:07:37.367
There's a place
I think you'd really like.

1331
01:07:39.467 --> 01:07:40.567
I'd love to.

1332
01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:54.967
I knew you screwed up
my soda bread! I was so careful.

1333
01:07:54.967 --> 01:07:58.000
I know. I'm sorry.

1334
01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.567
And you should have given me
those points in hurling.

1335
01:08:00.567 --> 01:08:02.467
Mm. still on the fence
about that one.

1336
01:08:02.467 --> 01:08:05.100
Wait. what about Siobhan's
class? Did you mess up my yarn?

1337
01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:06.467
No. that was all you.

1338
01:08:06.467 --> 01:08:07.567
[both chuckle]

1339
01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:10.400
I get it.

1340
01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:14.066
I came in here all threatening.
and you felt territorial.

1341
01:08:14.066 --> 01:08:15.533
More like protective.

1342
01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:19.700
That's kind of the same thing.

1343
01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:22.433
Well. I don't feel territorial
or protective anymore.

1344
01:08:26.433 --> 01:08:28.767
Now I feel
I have a teammate in all this.

1345
01:08:30.734 --> 01:08:32.233
You do?

1346
01:08:33.367 --> 01:08:35.533
Yeah. I do.

1347
01:08:37.767 --> 01:08:39.500
[Grant] Oh. hey there!

1348
01:08:40.967 --> 01:08:42.967
[Grant] Nice spot for a picnic.

1349
01:08:42.967 --> 01:08:44.233
Yep.

1350
01:08:44.233 --> 01:08:47.400
Beautiful sedimentary rock
out here.

1351
01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:50.400
Hon. will you remind me
to look that up?

1352
01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:54.867
Cos I'm curious
if it's sandstone or limestone.

1353
01:08:54.867 --> 01:08:57.266
You two enjoy the terrain.

1354
01:08:57.266 --> 01:08:59.533
Good luck.

1355
01:08:59.533 --> 01:09:00.934
[laughs]

1356
01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:05.633
I'm so sorry
your guy found someone else.

1357
01:09:05.633 --> 01:09:08.100
I am so crushed. [laughs]

1358
01:09:09.133 --> 01:09:10.667
I'm happy for him.

1359
01:09:10.667 --> 01:09:14.967
She must be... really into
gardening. or landscaping. or...

1360
01:09:14.967 --> 01:09:17.767
-Or tuning people out?
-[laughs]

1361
01:09:19.767 --> 01:09:21.333
To unexpected matches.

1362
01:09:22.467 --> 01:09:23.734
I wish them all the luck.

1363
01:09:30.867 --> 01:09:33.133
[pub chatter]

1364
01:09:36.667 --> 01:09:39.867
Oh. Brennan.
I'm glad it's you back here.

1365
01:09:39.867 --> 01:09:41.433
I was thinking it was your dad.

1366
01:09:41.433 --> 01:09:43.467
sneaking a dessert
before the party.

1367
01:09:43.467 --> 01:09:45.500
No. just me.

1368
01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:47.533
I don't want to jinx it.
but I thought it might be nice

1369
01:09:47.533 --> 01:09:49.200
to have a bottle
of something special

1370
01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:51.367
to celebrate with Lindsey
if her boss goes for the idea.

1371
01:09:51.367 --> 01:09:54.700
Not to put any pressure on you
tonight. but maybe--

1372
01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:56.300
Mum. stop it. please.

1373
01:09:56.300 --> 01:09:58.934
I'm a grown man.
I don't need romantic advice.

1374
01:09:58.934 --> 01:10:02.700
I was only going to suggest
you wear your blue suit.

1375
01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:04.567
Makes your eyes look nice.

1376
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.633
How possible is it

1377
01:10:12.633 --> 01:10:14.467
that Mr. Krispen thinks
I've totally lost my mind?

1378
01:10:14.467 --> 01:10:16.367
[Ellie] It's possible.

1379
01:10:16.367 --> 01:10:18.266
But he could also say it's
the best idea he's ever heard

1380
01:10:18.266 --> 01:10:20.200
and give you a corner office.

1381
01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:21.700
It's the perfect solution.

1382
01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:23.533
You have to text me
right after you pitch him

1383
01:10:23.533 --> 01:10:25.333
and let me know how it goes.

1384
01:10:25.333 --> 01:10:26.800
If I don't write back. it's
because we're in a big meeting

1385
01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:28.500
with that UK company
I was telling you about.

1386
01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:30.934
I hear they're starting
a preservation initiative.

1387
01:10:30.934 --> 01:10:32.500
something that might be
up your alley.

1388
01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:33.667
Yeah. sure.

1389
01:10:33.667 --> 01:10:35.667
Any updates on Mr. Town Council?

1390
01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:39.834
I'm focusing on my pitch. El.

1391
01:10:39.834 --> 01:10:41.300
I can only handle

1392
01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:43.433
one potentially upending
life event at a time.

1393
01:10:43.433 --> 01:10:46.166
I'm giving you
a virtual fist bump.

1394
01:10:46.166 --> 01:10:48.400
-Good luck at the party.
-Thank you.

1395
01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.600
[quiet chatter]

1396
01:10:59.467 --> 01:11:03.367
-Hi.
-Hi.

1397
01:11:03.367 --> 01:11:05.700
-Quite the night ahead of us.
-We do.

1398
01:11:07.033 --> 01:11:08.734
-[Brennan] Think that's him?
-Yeah.

1399
01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:13.166
Oh. gosh. Oh. my gosh.
that's my ring.

1400
01:11:13.166 --> 01:11:14.900
It's OK.

1401
01:11:17.767 --> 01:11:19.400
Oh. look. it's a proposal!

1402
01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:22.600
See? I told you
this festival worked.

1403
01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:24.233
[Brennan] No.

1404
01:11:29.867 --> 01:11:31.567
By the way. you look stunning.

1405
01:11:33.066 --> 01:11:35.100
Thank you.

1406
01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:37.500
-Ready?
-I'm ready.

1407
01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:47.066
Mr. Krispen.

1408
01:11:47.066 --> 01:11:48.567
-How are you?
-How are you?

1409
01:11:48.567 --> 01:11:50.433
-Beautiful.
-Sir. welcome to Kilabbey.

1410
01:11:50.433 --> 01:11:52.667
Thank you. Lovely.
How wonderful. Good to see you.

1411
01:11:52.667 --> 01:11:54.734
Come with me. I can't wait
to show you around.

1412
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.300
[traditional Irish music]

1413
01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:13.900
[clapping]

1414
01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:23.700
[music ends. applause]

1415
01:12:31.834 --> 01:12:34.333
That's. uh...
That's really quite something.

1416
01:12:34.333 --> 01:12:35.767
I know.

1417
01:12:35.767 --> 01:12:37.100
They do this
every year of the festival?

1418
01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:38.767
Yes. And I have it
on good authority

1419
01:12:38.767 --> 01:12:40.633
that there may be
fireworks later.

1420
01:12:42.467 --> 01:12:45.300
Ooh. what are those?

1421
01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:46.900
Irish trifle.

1422
01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:49.266
It's actually made
by one of the council members.

1423
01:12:49.266 --> 01:12:50.967
She has a bakery.

1424
01:12:50.967 --> 01:12:54.000
There's a lot of family-owned
businesses in the area.

1425
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.600
Mm!

1426
01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:57.133
I know. [chuckles]

1427
01:12:57.133 --> 01:12:58.967
We ought to see
if we can do a deal.

1428
01:12:58.967 --> 01:13:01.633
see if we can sell some
of her goods in the restaurant.

1429
01:13:01.633 --> 01:13:03.467
Sounds like we have a lot
to talk about

1430
01:13:03.467 --> 01:13:06.066
-in regards to the property.
-[glasses chinking]

1431
01:13:06.066 --> 01:13:08.567
Fáilte romhaibh!

1432
01:13:08.567 --> 01:13:09.900
[chatter quiets]

1433
01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:11.367
[chuckles]

1434
01:13:11.367 --> 01:13:13.333
Ah. the last night
of the festival

1435
01:13:13.333 --> 01:13:15.834
is always bittersweet for me.

1436
01:13:15.834 --> 01:13:18.667
Some of you have found
friendship here.

1437
01:13:18.667 --> 01:13:21.834
meaningful experience.
adventure.

1438
01:13:21.834 --> 01:13:27.734
And some of you have found love.
or the beginnings of it.

1439
01:13:27.734 --> 01:13:31.233
And I admit that my matching
isn't always perfect.

1440
01:13:31.233 --> 01:13:33.133
but it's not supposed to be.

1441
01:13:33.133 --> 01:13:38.867
We hope that
you take the spirit of Kilabbey

1442
01:13:38.867 --> 01:13:40.300
home with you.

1443
01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:42.934
You're always welcome back.

1444
01:13:44.066 --> 01:13:45.333
Till we meet again!

1445
01:13:45.333 --> 01:13:46.667
[cheering]

1446
01:13:46.667 --> 01:13:48.333
[applause]

1447
01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:01.200
-Thank you.
-Sláinte.

1448
01:14:03.967 --> 01:14:05.767
-Have you made your pitch yet?
-No. I haven't.

1449
01:14:05.767 --> 01:14:09.233
But I feel like
it's going to go really well.

1450
01:14:09.233 --> 01:14:12.266
Speaking of pitches.
I have one for you.

1451
01:14:12.266 --> 01:14:14.433
-For me?
-Yeah.

1452
01:14:14.433 --> 01:14:17.467
I spoke to Aoife.
and she sparked at the idea

1453
01:14:17.467 --> 01:14:19.700
of turning her barn
into a distillery

1454
01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:21.900
at a really reasonable price.

1455
01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:25.100
So I did some research and
started a business plan for you.

1456
01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:27.367
where you could still make
small-batch whiskey.

1457
01:14:27.367 --> 01:14:30.967
just...
on a slightly larger scale.

1458
01:14:30.967 --> 01:14:33.533
That's really. um... Wow.

1459
01:14:35.533 --> 01:14:38.734
I just... I was just trying
to help. I...

1460
01:14:38.734 --> 01:14:41.367
I just... I...
Cos you love it so much.

1461
01:14:41.367 --> 01:14:42.500
Yeah. I do.

1462
01:14:46.633 --> 01:14:48.967
I'm gonna go find Mr. Krispen.

1463
01:14:48.967 --> 01:14:50.400
Good luck.

1464
01:14:52.066 --> 01:14:54.934
[Krispen] Yep. we'll be
in touch. Yeah. Thank you.

1465
01:14:54.934 --> 01:14:57.734
Yeah. Goodbye.

1466
01:14:57.734 --> 01:15:01.066
Mr. Krispen. I hope
you're enjoying the party?

1467
01:15:02.133 --> 01:15:03.500
That was Dublin.

1468
01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:05.500
They offered
to drop the sale price.

1469
01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:07.500
make it a more enticing offer.

1470
01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:10.133
I told them
I'd have to think on it.

1471
01:15:10.133 --> 01:15:13.367
Well. there is a reason
I wanted you to come here

1472
01:15:13.367 --> 01:15:15.200
and experience this land.

1473
01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:18.867
Because I think
that we can make this property

1474
01:15:18.867 --> 01:15:21.333
more profitable and marketable
than Dublin.

1475
01:15:21.333 --> 01:15:23.033
And how is that?

1476
01:15:23.033 --> 01:15:25.333
We build a resort
onto the castle.

1477
01:15:25.333 --> 01:15:27.433
We'd draw people in

1478
01:15:27.433 --> 01:15:29.300
that are looking for
a historic experience.

1479
01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:31.200
but give them all the comforts
of a modern one.

1480
01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:33.934
We're blending the old
and the new.

1481
01:15:33.934 --> 01:15:37.300
It would be unlike anything
that you have ever built before.

1482
01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:38.800
And the council members.

1483
01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:40.633
they're eager for us
on come up with a price

1484
01:15:40.633 --> 01:15:42.367
that will make it
worth our while.

1485
01:15:42.367 --> 01:15:45.467
which I absolutely think it is.

1486
01:15:45.467 --> 01:15:48.667
Lindsey.
I have to go with Dublin then.

1487
01:15:48.667 --> 01:15:50.467
It's not even a choice.

1488
01:15:50.467 --> 01:15:53.266
This castle is magnificent.

1489
01:15:53.266 --> 01:15:55.000
I recognize the beauty in it.

1490
01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.266
But the cost of incorporating it
into a new design.

1491
01:15:57.266 --> 01:15:59.500
let alone doing a renovation?

1492
01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:02.333
It's not the kind of project
our company can take on.

1493
01:16:02.333 --> 01:16:04.033
OK. well.
what about a partnership?

1494
01:16:04.033 --> 01:16:06.200
A collaboration
with another company?

1495
01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:09.200
We may never get a chance to do
anything like this ever again.

1496
01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:11.834
Our company isn't
about enhancing the past.

1497
01:16:11.834 --> 01:16:13.567
it's focusing on the future.

1498
01:16:13.567 --> 01:16:18.400
I value your opinion.
but I've made up my mind.

1499
01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:20.734
You enjoy the rest of the party.

1500
01:16:20.734 --> 01:16:23.867
We'll debrief
when we get back to New York.

1501
01:16:23.867 --> 01:16:25.467
I'll see you soon.

1502
01:16:30.533 --> 01:16:32.433
[car engine starts]

1503
01:16:32.433 --> 01:16:33.567
Well?

1504
01:16:34.667 --> 01:16:36.300
He didn't go for it.

1505
01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:42.233
What?

1506
01:16:44.367 --> 01:16:46.200
So it's all over? That's it?

1507
01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:49.500
I said everything that I could.

1508
01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:54.667
He said that it's not something

1509
01:16:54.667 --> 01:16:56.633
that our company can take on
right now.

1510
01:16:57.700 --> 01:17:00.266
I'm so sorry.

1511
01:17:00.266 --> 01:17:02.400
I really thought
our plan was gonna work.

1512
01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:07.600
Guess I have to go back
to New York now.

1513
01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:11.700
I mean... it's not like I have
anything to stay here for.

1514
01:17:15.233 --> 01:17:17.567
No. Of course.

1515
01:17:20.567 --> 01:17:23.333
You should come back inside.

1516
01:17:23.333 --> 01:17:25.467
I know everyone's gonna want
to say goodbye.

1517
01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:29.333
I will. Just give me a sec.

1518
01:17:29.333 --> 01:17:31.133
Be in in a second.

1519
01:17:35.467 --> 01:17:36.600
Yeah.

1520
01:18:02.033 --> 01:18:03.467
[cheering]

1521
01:18:03.467 --> 01:18:05.533
[fireworks explode]

1522
01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:17.600
And I know you'll be
back here soon. Olivia.

1523
01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:20.533
Congratulations.
Rory's a good lad.

1524
01:18:20.533 --> 01:18:22.967
He is.
And thanks for everything.

1525
01:18:22.967 --> 01:18:24.800
It's been such a wonderful week.

1526
01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:27.600
We're sorry things didn't work
out with the castle. Lindsey.

1527
01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:29.233
But getting to fix it up

1528
01:18:29.233 --> 01:18:31.800
made us feel so much
more connected to this place.

1529
01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:33.400
Thank you.

1530
01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:37.066
Thank you. And thank you so much
for working so hard.

1531
01:18:38.567 --> 01:18:40.066
Bye.

1532
01:18:40.066 --> 01:18:41.667
[Lindsey] Bye.

1533
01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:48.367
And maybe the right buyer
will come along

1534
01:18:48.367 --> 01:18:50.533
and want to save your castle.

1535
01:18:50.533 --> 01:18:53.233
I think you can call it
"our castle" now. love.

1536
01:19:01.633 --> 01:19:03.433
Thank you for everything.

1537
01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:15.200
[Alroy] I know you're
disappointed about last night.

1538
01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:18.367
We all are. But it's important
that we decided

1539
01:19:18.367 --> 01:19:19.767
we were ready for a change.

1540
01:19:19.767 --> 01:19:23.800
Change is necessary.
It's part of life.

1541
01:19:25.834 --> 01:19:29.700
I know my matching
isn't always up to the mark.

1542
01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:31.867
but I'm not usually
that far off.

1543
01:19:31.867 --> 01:19:35.000
Lindsey was a surprise.

1544
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.533
It wouldn't have worked. Alroy.

1545
01:19:36.533 --> 01:19:39.700
I don't think I'm ready
to be with someone again.

1546
01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:41.667
To have that hurt
all over again.

1547
01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:46.667
[Brennan] Lindsey doesn't want
to stay here and I do.

1548
01:19:46.667 --> 01:19:48.333
She doesn't have a life here.

1549
01:20:02.934 --> 01:20:05.500
[boat horn honks]

1550
01:20:09.333 --> 01:20:11.533
[Krispen] So.
that's a green light

1551
01:20:11.533 --> 01:20:13.467
on Tate Property Australia.

1552
01:20:16.166 --> 01:20:17.600
Lindsey?

1553
01:20:18.633 --> 01:20:20.000
What do you think?

1554
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.133
Yeah. No problem.
I can be there on Monday.

1555
01:20:23.133 --> 01:20:25.600
I already have a relationship
with their team in Sydney.

1556
01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:27.500
I'll get started on this
right away.

1557
01:20:28.533 --> 01:20:30.333
[Krispen] Perfect. Great.

1558
01:20:30.333 --> 01:20:33.000
Um... So what I'm trying to
accomplish on the Tate property

1559
01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.934
is similar to what we just did
with the Kaiser.

1560
01:20:37.934 --> 01:20:41.400
[phone buzzes]

1561
01:20:46.033 --> 01:20:47.400
[chuckles]

1562
01:21:05.834 --> 01:21:07.300
Kilabbey.

1563
01:21:08.867 --> 01:21:10.266
Guess who got us tickets

1564
01:21:10.266 --> 01:21:12.500
to that Egyptology exhibit
this weekend?

1565
01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:15.166
You're welcome. I actually
am really excited about it.

1566
01:21:15.166 --> 01:21:17.400
I heard there's gonna be
an Egyptian food truck.

1567
01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:20.033
Mr. Krispen asked me to stop by.
see if you want to take a look

1568
01:21:20.033 --> 01:21:21.667
at my specs
for the Gersh project.

1569
01:21:21.667 --> 01:21:24.467
since there may be some overlap
with Melbourne.

1570
01:21:25.834 --> 01:21:27.166
I don't think
I'm going to do that.

1571
01:21:27.166 --> 01:21:29.533
You want someone else
to take it?

1572
01:21:29.533 --> 01:21:33.800
No. I... think
I'm going to quit.

1573
01:21:34.867 --> 01:21:36.533
I'm sorry. what?

1574
01:21:36.533 --> 01:21:39.900
Yeah. There's always gonna be
another deal to make.

1575
01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:42.600
another redeye to catch.

1576
01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:45.600
I want to be in one place.

1577
01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:47.700
overseeing one project
at a time.

1578
01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:49.734
I want to be
a part of the process.

1579
01:21:49.734 --> 01:21:53.767
not just hopping on a plane
the second the contract's done.

1580
01:21:53.767 --> 01:21:55.867
It's like I'm missing
all of the good stuff

1581
01:21:55.867 --> 01:21:57.300
in the sandwich.

1582
01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:01.567
OK. so... where would you go?

1583
01:22:01.567 --> 01:22:03.567
A management company
in New York?

1584
01:22:03.567 --> 01:22:05.166
I don't know.

1585
01:22:05.166 --> 01:22:07.467
But I'm excited to find out.

1586
01:22:07.467 --> 01:22:09.734
[stream roars]

1587
01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:13.767
So the fermenter's gonna go
over there.

1588
01:22:13.767 --> 01:22:15.400
the boiling pots there.

1589
01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:17.667
I want to make sure I still have
enough storage space.

1590
01:22:17.667 --> 01:22:20.233
I heard you had another offer.
An investor in Galway?

1591
01:22:20.233 --> 01:22:22.800
I did. Means we might be able
to open even earlier.

1592
01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:26.300
Good. Your mam sent me over
with your lunch.

1593
01:22:26.300 --> 01:22:28.567
and this for the walls. right.

1594
01:22:33.133 --> 01:22:34.433
Alroy wanted me to tell you

1595
01:22:34.433 --> 01:22:36.900
he'll see you at the castle
later on.

1596
01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:38.700
-Right.
-All right?

1597
01:23:00.166 --> 01:23:03.333
Our engineer will double check
with the inspection report

1598
01:23:03.333 --> 01:23:05.533
and make sure none of
the walls are weight bearing.

1599
01:23:05.533 --> 01:23:07.100
That sounds grand.

1600
01:23:10.367 --> 01:23:12.934
Ah. Brennan. Good timing.

1601
01:23:18.333 --> 01:23:20.967
What are you doing here?

1602
01:23:20.967 --> 01:23:26.166
I'm evaluating the property
for my new company.

1603
01:23:26.166 --> 01:23:27.667
They're looking

1604
01:23:27.667 --> 01:23:30.000
to get a preservation initiative
off the ground.

1605
01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.133
and when I mentioned
the property.

1606
01:23:32.133 --> 01:23:35.166
-they were very interested.
-Really?

1607
01:23:38.367 --> 01:23:41.467
Lindsey. I'll see you
back at the council chamber.

1608
01:23:41.467 --> 01:23:42.467
OK.

1609
01:23:49.667 --> 01:23:51.533
I never heard back from you.

1610
01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:54.533
I know.

1611
01:23:54.533 --> 01:23:58.166
[sighs] I thought
it would be easier.

1612
01:23:58.166 --> 01:24:00.066
I should never
have let you leave like that.

1613
01:24:01.934 --> 01:24:03.400
And I'm sorry I was so weird

1614
01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:04.934
about the business proposal
that you started.

1615
01:24:04.934 --> 01:24:07.700
-The unsolicited proposal?
-But you were right.

1616
01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:09.734
I am starting a distillery
at Aoife's.

1617
01:24:10.967 --> 01:24:14.200
Turns out
that change isn't so scary.

1618
01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:15.967
Taking a chance isn't so scary

1619
01:24:15.967 --> 01:24:17.767
when you're doing
something you love.

1620
01:24:19.533 --> 01:24:21.533
And it seems
that you're doing the same.

1621
01:24:24.033 --> 01:24:28.233
Well... You know. if this
project gets off the ground.

1622
01:24:28.233 --> 01:24:32.200
I'm probably gonna be
stationed here. overseeing it.

1623
01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:36.734
Until then I'll be in the UK.
managing smaller restorations.

1624
01:24:36.734 --> 01:24:41.133
So... maybe we could start
going back and forth?

1625
01:24:41.133 --> 01:24:43.533
Why would we do that?

1626
01:24:43.533 --> 01:24:45.567
Well. I know I need
a taste tester.

1627
01:24:45.567 --> 01:24:47.700
OK. Yeah.

1628
01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:49.200
Occasional whiskey pourer.

1629
01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:51.333
I think we could
probably work something out.

1630
01:24:59.433 --> 01:25:02.000
My grandmother's ring.

1631
01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:05.767
It's engraved "JTK Jewelers".

1632
01:25:05.767 --> 01:25:07.934
It was made in Kilabbey.

1633
01:25:07.934 --> 01:25:11.300
I just...
I'd never looked closely enough.

1634
01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:17.567
And it was facing the wrong way.

1635
01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:22.166
This means you're taken?

1636
01:25:24.867 --> 01:25:26.333
I hope so.
