47
00:02:57.438 --> 00:02:59.483
I think I'm dying!

48
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.877
If you must die.
can you do it somewhere else?

49
00:03:01.964 --> 00:03:04.314

actually pee myself!

50
00:03:04.401 --> 00:03:06.925

Hey. I'm Ginny. Open up!

58
00:03:23.638 --> 00:03:24.508
Go away!

59
00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:29.209
It's okay. kid.
It's just your period.

60
00:03:29.296 --> 00:03:31.385
I know. but menstruation
isn't supposed to happen

61
00:03:31.472 --> 00:03:34.562
until age 12.
I still have eight more months!

62
00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:36.781
Look at you.
ahead of the game.

63
00:03:36.868 --> 00:03:38.870
What if I'm hemorrhaging?

64
00:03:38.957 --> 00:03:41.003
Look. I know what
I'm talking about. okay?

65
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.048
I got my first period at 10.

66
00:03:43.135 --> 00:03:45.529
and my mom bought me
my first bras when I was 11.

67
00:03:45.616 --> 00:03:48.880
We walked into JC Penny.
bought 3 demi cups.

68
00:03:48.967 --> 00:03:51.231
and burned them
right in the parking lot.

69
00:03:51.318 --> 00:03:52.667
Mmm...

70
00:03:52.754 --> 00:03:54.799
You can't smoke in here!

71
00:03:57.715 --> 00:03:59.413
You gotta stick it up
inside you.

72
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.545
In-- Inside me?

73
00:04:01.632 --> 00:04:03.199
What is happening in there?!

74
00:04:03.286 --> 00:04:06.724
She's blossoming
into womanhood! Chill.

75
00:04:06.811 --> 00:04:08.117
Gross!

76
00:04:09.161 --> 00:04:10.598
Can you do it?

77
00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:13.340
Fine.

78
00:04:18.823 --> 00:04:21.261
Finally.

79
00:04:21.348 --> 00:04:22.697
Come with me. Let's go.

80
00:04:22.784 --> 00:04:24.525
Hmm?
Let's go.

81
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.487
You're never gonna hit it
if you don't believe you can.

82
00:04:33.447 --> 00:04:35.840
Hmm. Not bad. pinky.

83
00:04:35.927 --> 00:04:38.234
What can I say?
I'm a natural.

84
00:04:43.021 --> 00:04:44.849
Nora? What are you doing?

85
00:04:44.936 --> 00:04:46.416
Okay.

86
00:04:46.503 --> 00:04:47.765
Uh. let me help you here.

87
00:04:47.852 --> 00:04:49.201
Um. first straighten that up.

88
00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:50.986
Raise your elbow up a bit.
Okay. Not bad.

89
00:04:51.073 --> 00:04:52.683
Now. aim a little higher.

90
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.555
Good. good. good. Fire!

91
00:04:57.558 --> 00:04:59.864
- Shit! Too high!
- Go. go. go!

92
00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:01.562
Did she just hit him?

93
00:05:04.608 --> 00:05:06.088
Hold on!

94
00:05:06.175 --> 00:05:07.872
We're coming to help you!

95
00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:11.311
Oh. my God! I'm so sorry!

96
00:05:11.398 --> 00:05:13.313
Never apologize
until you see blood.

97
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.836
Hey. guys?

98
00:05:16.533 --> 00:05:19.231
I think it looks worse

99
00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.538
- than it is.
- Looks pretty bad.

100
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.239
You three. Come with me.

101
00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:29.894
<i>I thought for sure we were
gonna get kicked out.</i>

102
00:05:29.981 --> 00:05:31.374
All right. listen up.

103
00:05:31.461 --> 00:05:33.985
I have not seen
much integration

104
00:05:34.072 --> 00:05:36.727
between the three of you
and your respective cohorts.

105
00:05:36.814 --> 00:05:38.947
so we have decided to try

106
00:05:39.034 --> 00:05:41.732
putting all of you
in one group.

107
00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:43.255
Sassafras.

108
00:05:50.393 --> 00:05:51.829
I actually...

109
00:06:02.013 --> 00:06:04.799
<i>Year after year.
we returned to camp.</i>

110
00:06:06.583 --> 00:06:08.193
I haven't seen you guys
since last year!

111
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.065
I know! I missed you!

112
00:06:11.762 --> 00:06:13.590
<i>Those eight weeks</i>

113
00:06:13.677 --> 00:06:16.376
<i>were what made
the other 44 bearable.</i>

114
00:06:22.947 --> 00:06:24.949
<i>We never really fit in...</i>

115
00:06:27.212 --> 00:06:28.736
<i>until we found each other.</i>

116
00:06:28.823 --> 00:06:30.433
You got it. Mary!

117
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.000
- Whoo! Go. Mary!
- Whoo! Yeah!

118
00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:37.484
<i>I was there for their wins.</i>

119
00:06:37.571 --> 00:06:39.181
<i>cheering them on...</i>

120
00:06:44.186 --> 00:06:47.015
<i>Their wing woman when they had
their first crushes</i>

121
00:06:47.102 --> 00:06:49.452
<i>on whip-smart Stevie D.</i>

122
00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:51.019
<i>Did you see that look?</i>

123
00:06:51.106 --> 00:06:53.413
<i>And handsome as hell Tommy.</i>

124
00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.939
<i>And I like to think
I brought both of them</i>

125
00:06:58.026 --> 00:06:59.897
<i>out of their shells.</i>

126
00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:04.641
<i>We promised to stay
best friends forever.</i>

127
00:07:04.728 --> 00:07:07.601
<i>We had big dreams of
going to the same college</i>

128
00:07:07.688 --> 00:07:09.690
<i>and ending up
in the same town.</i>

129
00:07:09.777 --> 00:07:11.300
Peeing!

130
00:07:13.302 --> 00:07:14.912
<i>But 50 years later.</i>

131
00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:16.610
<i>we hadn't exactly
kept our promises.</i>

132
00:07:18.307 --> 00:07:19.874
<i>There was no way in hell</i>

133
00:07:19.961 --> 00:07:22.790
<i>I was gonna let 'em miss
our summer-camp reunion.</i>

134
00:07:22.877 --> 00:07:26.184
<i>I was a self-made
self-help sensation.</i>

135
00:07:26.271 --> 00:07:27.925
<i>I felt like I was the only one</i>

136
00:07:28.012 --> 00:07:30.188
<i>making efforts
to catch up anymore.</i>

137
00:07:30.275 --> 00:07:32.626
Get your ass down here.
We need to get to Nora's.

138
00:07:32.713 --> 00:07:34.976
<i>I'm still on shift.
I'll be out in 20.</i>

139
00:07:35.063 --> 00:07:36.804
<i>And. Gin.
don't talk to anyone.</i>

140
00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:39.937
Oh. Mary. You know
I can't ignore the fans.

141
00:07:40.024 --> 00:07:43.593
Ms. Moon.
It is such an honor.

142
00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.117
Oh. I'll be glad
to sign that for you.

143
00:07:53.429 --> 00:07:56.519
<i>Mary got married. Settled.</i>

144
00:07:56.606 --> 00:07:58.695
<i>Ugh. don't tell her
I said that.</i>

145
00:07:58.782 --> 00:08:01.350
<i>She gave up her dream
of becoming a doctor.</i>

146
00:08:01.437 --> 00:08:03.265
<i>Although she eventually
went to nursing school.</i>

147
00:08:03.352 --> 00:08:05.485
Oh. I'm sorry.

148
00:08:05.572 --> 00:08:07.008
I have it on
"do not disturb."

149
00:08:07.095 --> 00:08:08.618
But there it is. disturbing.

150
00:08:08.705 --> 00:08:10.533
Hi. honey!
Is everything all right?

151
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.143
<i>Uh. where
do you keep the peanuts?</i>

152
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:14.015
<i>I've been tearing
the kitchen apart.</i>

153
00:08:14.102 --> 00:08:16.408
In the cabinet
on the left. Upper.

154
00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:18.585
<i>With the spices?
I swear I looked there.</i>

155
00:08:18.672 --> 00:08:21.501
No. no. I wouldn't keep
a snack food with the spices.

156
00:08:21.588 --> 00:08:22.806
I gotta go.

157
00:08:24.634 --> 00:08:26.157
Come on. Come on.

158
00:08:27.898 --> 00:08:29.944
Ah. There he is.

159
00:08:33.425 --> 00:08:37.473
Doesn't "do not disturb"
mean anything?

160
00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.475
<i>If Mary was tough
to convince.</i>

161
00:08:39.562 --> 00:08:42.783
<i>Nora was gonna be like teaching
cats synchronized swimming.</i>

162
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.959
<i>She was notorious
for bailing on plans</i>

163
00:08:45.046 --> 00:08:46.830
<i>to get the band
back together.</i>

164
00:08:46.917 --> 00:08:48.745
<i>opting instead for a sad.</i>

165
00:08:48.832 --> 00:08:51.835
<i>solitary. sanitized existence.</i>

166
00:08:51.922 --> 00:08:53.445
<i>If we were gonna
get her to come.</i>

167
00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:55.709
<i>we'd have to stage
a full-on kidnapping.</i>

168
00:08:57.362 --> 00:08:58.450
Oh. God.

169
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.719
I apologize.
No. I am. I'm hearing you.

170
00:09:05.806 --> 00:09:08.156
- No.
- Yeah. No. I can understand

171
00:09:08.243 --> 00:09:12.682
what you're saying. and you
are being heard 100%. Mm-hmm.

172
00:09:12.769 --> 00:09:15.206
I'm on it right now.
Okay? Bye.

173
00:09:15.293 --> 00:09:16.556
So...
Mm-hmm?

174
00:09:16.643 --> 00:09:18.514
Uh. Ginny Moon managed
to track down

175
00:09:18.601 --> 00:09:19.907
- my cell phone number.
- What?

176
00:09:19.994 --> 00:09:22.344
And she said. um... She said?

177
00:09:22.431 --> 00:09:24.694
"If you don't
pick up the effing phone.

178
00:09:24.781 --> 00:09:26.391
she's going to send
the entire company

179
00:09:26.478 --> 00:09:28.045
pictures of you all
in Cancun

180
00:09:28.132 --> 00:09:31.222
getting wet and wild
with Cabana Carlos in '97."

181
00:09:31.309 --> 00:09:33.224
She also said
that she wanted you

182
00:09:33.311 --> 00:09:34.356
to look out the window.

183
00:09:34.443 --> 00:09:35.749
- What do you mean?
- Uh...

184
00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:37.881
What?

185
00:09:40.667 --> 00:09:42.756
We're stealth!

186
00:09:45.323 --> 00:09:47.674
I do not have time for this.

187
00:09:47.761 --> 00:09:49.371
I simply do not
have time for this.

188
00:09:49.458 --> 00:09:50.677
- I'll get rid of them.
- Yeah. yeah.

189
00:09:50.764 --> 00:09:51.852
- I'll get rid of them.
- Yeah. fine.

190
00:09:51.939 --> 00:09:53.593
Right this way. Miss Moon.

191
00:09:55.246 --> 00:09:58.075
Uh. it is such an honor
to meet you.

192
00:09:58.162 --> 00:09:59.947
And... Hi.

193
00:10:00.034 --> 00:10:02.427
I read the <i>Get Your Shit
Together</i> box set

194
00:10:02.514 --> 00:10:03.646
cover to cover. Twice.

195
00:10:03.733 --> 00:10:05.039
It really helped me cut out

196
00:10:05.126 --> 00:10:06.910
all the toxic relationships
in my life.

197
00:10:06.997 --> 00:10:10.174
Now I live alone with my
Bichon Frise. Martin. and. um...

198
00:10:12.699 --> 00:10:14.091
...I've never been happier.

199
00:10:14.178 --> 00:10:15.876
- I know how to open a door.
- It's a little heavy.

200
00:10:15.963 --> 00:10:17.617
I know. I'll give you
a selfie later.

201
00:10:17.704 --> 00:10:19.314
I'll give you
a couple of selfies. Nora!

202
00:10:19.401 --> 00:10:21.185
Hey. stranger.
It's been a while. huh?

203
00:10:21.272 --> 00:10:22.709
Are you Nora Thompson Gray?

204
00:10:22.796 --> 00:10:23.971
Is that Mary?

205
00:10:24.058 --> 00:10:25.537
Of course it's Mary.

206
00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:27.061
Who else could I have convinced

207
00:10:27.148 --> 00:10:28.976
to wear that ridiculous
get-up?

208
00:10:29.063 --> 00:10:31.543
Oh. come on. Nora.
Help us kidnap you.

209
00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:34.764
Forgive me for not being
a more cooperative victim.

210
00:10:34.851 --> 00:10:36.287
You don't think
you're skipping out

211
00:10:36.374 --> 00:10:37.811
- on this reunion. do you?
- I'm sorry.

212
00:10:37.898 --> 00:10:39.900
I have to finish
a ton of paperwork.

213
00:10:39.987 --> 00:10:42.206
And look at this.
My swivel chair.

214
00:10:42.293 --> 00:10:43.555
It doesn't even swivel.

215
00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:45.732
It completely lost
its swivel.

216
00:10:45.819 --> 00:10:49.344
The CEO of a company
must swivel!

217
00:10:49.431 --> 00:10:51.085
Okay. Never mind.

218
00:10:53.261 --> 00:10:55.393
- Whoop!
- What's going on?

219
00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.135
Okay. great. No problem at all.

220
00:10:58.222 --> 00:11:00.355
I think this-- No! I'm...

221
00:11:00.442 --> 00:11:02.226
Okay. Okay.

222
00:11:02.313 --> 00:11:05.795
You can't just bully
Mary and me to get your way!

223
00:11:05.882 --> 00:11:07.754
I don't bully. I persuade.

224
00:11:07.841 --> 00:11:09.233
You threatened to retract

225
00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.887
Emma's school
recommendation letter.

226
00:11:10.974 --> 00:11:12.628
Ginny! She's 8!

227
00:11:12.715 --> 00:11:15.370
Actually. Nora. she's 18.

228
00:11:15.457 --> 00:11:16.850
My grandbaby's
applying to colleges.

229
00:11:16.937 --> 00:11:18.721
- Oh.
- See! Look how much

230
00:11:18.808 --> 00:11:20.070
of each other's lives
we've missed.

231
00:11:20.157 --> 00:11:22.203
I mean. the last time
we all got together

232
00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:24.379
without a bunch of cling-ons.
Mike had hair.

233
00:11:24.466 --> 00:11:26.555
Cling-ons?!
Do you mean family?

234
00:11:26.642 --> 00:11:28.383
Oh my God. Oh. please.

235
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:31.212
As much as it pains me
to admit this.

236
00:11:31.299 --> 00:11:32.866
she's right.

237
00:11:32.953 --> 00:11:36.521
July will be 15 years
since Wesley died.

238
00:11:36.608 --> 00:11:38.219
Tsk. Oh. man.

239
00:11:38.306 --> 00:11:39.916
And I would argue
that a funeral

240
00:11:40.003 --> 00:11:41.526
doesn't count as a girls' trip.

241
00:11:41.613 --> 00:11:44.486
However. you did get
topless in the hot tub.

242
00:11:44.573 --> 00:11:46.053
There's no right way
to grieve.

243
00:11:47.532 --> 00:11:49.752
Just come on!

244
00:11:49.839 --> 00:11:52.102
I haven't packed. You know.
I mean. I really-- I can't.

245
00:11:52.189 --> 00:11:54.452
Oh. I packed plenty
for both of you.

246
00:11:54.539 --> 00:11:57.629
And don't worry.
I'm past my caftan phase.

247
00:11:57.717 --> 00:11:58.892
Come on!

248
00:11:58.979 --> 00:12:01.851
<i>We all needed a change.</i>

249
00:12:01.938 --> 00:12:04.636
<i>Even if they didn't
know it yet.</i>

250
00:12:06.813 --> 00:12:09.250
I can't believe you drive
this thing yourself.

251
00:12:09.337 --> 00:12:10.251
Right?

252
00:12:10.338 --> 00:12:13.820
I can hardly handle my RAV4.

253
00:12:13.907 --> 00:12:15.560
Ooh. Why do you need

254
00:12:15.647 --> 00:12:17.606
a home security system
in an RV?

255
00:12:17.693 --> 00:12:19.260
Not to worry you. but I had

256
00:12:19.347 --> 00:12:22.698
a Mark David Chapman
situation a few years ago.

257
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:39.236

00:12:47.679 --> 00:12:51.335
Handle with care!
This isn't the TSA!

262
00:12:51.422 --> 00:12:53.555
Oh! Vick Cockburn.

263
00:12:53.642 --> 00:12:55.252
two-time
state wrestling champ.

264
00:12:55.339 --> 00:12:57.602
one-time Peoria Pie Eating
Contest winner.

265
00:12:57.689 --> 00:13:00.431
and would-be Army recruit
if it wasn't for my webbed toes.

266
00:13:00.518 --> 00:13:03.870
I will be your personal
liaison this week. Ms. Moon.

267
00:13:03.957 --> 00:13:05.175
I'll get you settled in.

268
00:13:05.262 --> 00:13:06.698
ensure the premises
remains secure.

269
00:13:10.441 --> 00:13:13.009
Oh. 10-4. I'm on it!

270
00:13:15.838 --> 00:13:18.928
Our cabin!
Oh!

271
00:13:19.015 --> 00:13:20.364
I'm not sleeping on the top.

272
00:13:20.451 --> 00:13:23.628
I'm starting to have flashbacks.

273
00:13:23.715 --> 00:13:26.327
Oh. my God. I don't remember
there being steps here.

274
00:13:29.721 --> 00:13:31.245
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

275
00:13:31.332 --> 00:13:33.421
What?

276
00:13:33.508 --> 00:13:35.205
Oh. man.

277
00:13:37.468 --> 00:13:38.992
Ah. oh!

278
00:13:43.083 --> 00:13:45.781
It's exactly
how I remember it.

279
00:13:45.868 --> 00:13:49.176
That's exactly what
I was afraid of. actually.

280
00:13:53.397 --> 00:13:55.182
Yeah... There's a nice breeze.

281
00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:56.792
- Yeah.
- Don't worry.

282
00:13:56.879 --> 00:13:58.446
I knew this
wasn't gonna work.

283
00:14:04.539 --> 00:14:05.540
Ah. oh!

284
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:11.851
Yeah!

285
00:14:22.122 --> 00:14:23.775
Woof!

286
00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:25.168
What?
Check it out.

287
00:14:25.255 --> 00:14:27.214
What? Oh...

288
00:14:27.301 --> 00:14:28.389

292
00:14:36.179 --> 00:14:38.094
Can you just give it
to me for a minute? Please?

293
00:14:38.181 --> 00:14:40.401
Let me just see
for a second.

294
00:14:40.488 --> 00:14:43.534
Uh-oh. Oh. hello.

295
00:14:43.621 --> 00:14:45.797
How are you. sirs?

296
00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:48.191
Oh. my gosh. It's Stevie D.

297
00:14:48.278 --> 00:14:49.801
Here. Lemme see. Let me see.

298
00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:51.412
Hey! Hey!

299
00:14:51.499 --> 00:14:54.197
God. that name
sounded a lot more edgy

300
00:14:54.284 --> 00:14:55.851
when we were 14. right?

301
00:14:55.938 --> 00:14:58.201
Can you imagine yelling that
at the top of your lungs?

302
00:14:58.288 --> 00:15:00.421
I don't think she has
much to imagine there.

303
00:15:00.508 --> 00:15:03.424
We kept everything
above the clothes.

304
00:15:03.511 --> 00:15:05.861
- He's a gentleman.
- Yeah. well. we can fix that.

305
00:15:05.948 --> 00:15:08.429
Time has been very good
to some of us.

306
00:15:08.516 --> 00:15:10.083
Hey. Speak for yourself.

307
00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:11.911
Oh. my freaking God!

308
00:15:14.565 --> 00:15:18.178
No freaking way!

309
00:15:18.265 --> 00:15:20.136
It's the Pretty Committee.

310
00:15:20.223 --> 00:15:22.095
How are they still
so pretty?

311
00:15:22.182 --> 00:15:24.010
- Pilates and plastic.
- Oh.

312
00:15:26.142 --> 00:15:27.578
Ginny Moon!

313
00:15:27.665 --> 00:15:29.711
Oh!

314
00:15:29.798 --> 00:15:31.843
- Hi. It's so firm.
- That's so great.

315
00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:35.412
It's so wonderful to see...
you girls.

316
00:15:35.499 --> 00:15:37.762
And Ginny. wow!

317
00:15:37.849 --> 00:15:40.461
We love you.
We've read all the books.

318
00:15:40.548 --> 00:15:42.724
- Power pose!
- Oh!

319
00:15:42.811 --> 00:15:44.856
- Oh. whoa.
- Wow.

320
00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:47.424
Okay. Evelyn. Judy.

321
00:15:47.511 --> 00:15:50.645
What say we go get in
a quick Pilates sesh?

322
00:15:50.732 --> 00:15:52.603
- Pilates?
- Told ya.

323
00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:54.475
We'll see you
at the reception.

324
00:15:54.562 --> 00:15:55.998
- Bye.
- See ya!

325
00:15:56.085 --> 00:15:58.435
Bye!
Bye!

326
00:15:58.522 --> 00:15:59.959
You're so famous!

00:16:00.046 --> 00:16:01.699
You're so famous!
Yeah.

328
00:16:01.786 --> 00:16:04.180
What are you doing? Okay.

329
00:16:04.267 --> 00:16:06.313
That's rude.

330
00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.923
If you think that was something.

331
00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:09.794
you'll really get a kick
out of this.

332
00:16:09.881 --> 00:16:12.014
4.5 million views.

333
00:16:12.101 --> 00:16:14.103
What?

334
00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:15.757
<i>I'm Ginny Moon.</i>

335

<i>Pause. Play it again.

<i>it's on you
to flip the script</i>

340
00:16:27.638 --> 00:16:31.207
<i>and take his ass
to the dumpster.</i>

341
00:16:31.294 --> 00:16:33.949
Real subtle.

342
00:16:34.036 --> 00:16:36.169
As a Brinks truck!

343
00:16:36.256 --> 00:16:39.215
Campers. check in and get
your cabin assignments here.

344
00:16:41.957 --> 00:16:44.438
Miss Moon.
We are so grateful

345
00:16:44.525 --> 00:16:46.266
to have you back
at Camp Pinnacle.

346
00:16:46.353 --> 00:16:48.224
And I believe
Vick's got you all set up

347
00:16:48.311 --> 00:16:49.747

Whoa!

348
00:16:49.834 --> 00:16:53.012
Hi! Hi.

349
00:16:53.099 --> 00:16:54.317
If you could kindly place

350
00:16:54.404 --> 00:16:56.754
your electronic devices
in this bin.

351
00:16:56.841 --> 00:16:59.105
What? Wh-- I'm sorry.
Come again?

352
00:16:59.192 --> 00:17:01.585
We aim to create
a technology-free environment

353
00:17:01.672 --> 00:17:04.327
so that you can truly enjoy
your time here and reconnect.

354
00:17:04.414 --> 00:17:06.416
Hear. hear. Ladies.

355
00:17:06.503 --> 00:17:08.853
we're not here for connection.

356
00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:12.596
We're here for reconnection!

357
00:17:12.683 --> 00:17:14.990
They will be locked
in a secured place

358
00:17:15.077 --> 00:17:17.079
and stored safely
until your departure.

359
00:17:17.166 --> 00:17:18.820
Which will be now.

360
00:17:18.907 --> 00:17:22.432
I can't traipse around the woods
for a week without Wi-Fi.

361
00:17:22.519 --> 00:17:24.260
I need to call Mike
every morning

362
00:17:24.347 --> 00:17:26.219
to make sure he doesn't
oversleep his alarm.

363
00:17:26.306 --> 00:17:28.047
Wait a minute.
So he can hear a phone call.

364
00:17:28.134 --> 00:17:29.570
but he can't hear
his own alarm?

365
00:17:29.657 --> 00:17:32.355
I can't go MIA.SAGE: Not to worry. ladies.

366
00:17:32.442 --> 00:17:33.878
There are phones and computers

367
00:17:33.965 --> 00:17:35.184
available to you in the lab.

368
00:17:35.271 --> 00:17:37.447
Okay. okay. fine. Fine.

369
00:17:37.534 --> 00:17:38.492
There.

370
00:17:40.494 --> 00:17:41.364
Thanks.

371
00:17:43.497 --> 00:17:45.151
Do you have an iPad?

372
00:17:45.238 --> 00:17:47.283
Oh. my God. You know what?
Here's the deal.

373
00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:49.764
Here. you can just
take it all. No problem.

374
00:17:49.851 --> 00:17:52.419
Okay? Yeah. shoot.
I wanted to do a strip search.

375
00:17:52.506 --> 00:17:53.811
That's not necessary.

376
00:17:53.898 --> 00:17:56.205
I don't know. Just in case.

377
00:17:56.292 --> 00:18:00.253
- Here we go!
- Yay! Wow.

378
00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:03.299
Wait. Wait for me.

379
00:18:03.386 --> 00:18:05.258
What do we have here?

380
00:18:06.781 --> 00:18:10.089
Miss Moon!
Did a little switcheroo for you.

381
00:18:10.176 --> 00:18:11.829
Think you'll like it.

382
00:18:11.916 --> 00:18:15.224

387
00:18:30.326 --> 00:18:32.894
You know what?
This could be in a magazine.

388
00:18:32.981 --> 00:18:36.463
Oh. it will be. I called in
a favor from my friend Martha.

389
00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:39.727
- and she zhuzhed it up for me.
- Martha? As in Stewart?!

390
00:18:39.814 --> 00:18:41.772
Yeah. but we're gonna
have to have words.

391
00:18:41.859 --> 00:18:43.557
This was supposed to be
ready this morning.

392
00:18:43.644 --> 00:18:47.996
Ginny. this is incredible!
Thank you.

393
00:18:48.083 --> 00:18:50.738
I revise what I said earlier.

394
00:18:50.825 --> 00:18:53.132
You can kidnap me any time.

395
00:18:55.438 --> 00:18:57.092
I figured that you could

396
00:18:57.179 --> 00:18:59.007
re-ignite that passion
of yours.

397
00:18:59.094 --> 00:19:01.444
I haven't been
on a horse in 50 years!

398
00:19:01.531 --> 00:19:04.404
Well. baby. maybe it's time
you got up on one.

399
00:19:04.491 --> 00:19:08.495
You really are amazing.
Ginny Moon.

400
00:19:08.582 --> 00:19:11.454
I know! And I brought these
for you.

401
00:19:11.541 --> 00:19:14.370
Huh? Well...

402
00:19:14.457 --> 00:19:17.373
- What is it. though?
- It's a vibrating egg.

403
00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.070
Oh! Don't do that area.

404
00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:20.768
I see a lot of these in the ER.

405
00:19:20.855 --> 00:19:22.726
- Oh. my God!
- Remote control.

406
00:19:22.813 --> 00:19:25.860
- They get stuck!
- These are professional grade.

407
00:19:25.947 --> 00:19:27.166
They're recommended
by gynecologists

408
00:19:27.253 --> 00:19:28.863
all over
the United States.

409
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:30.734
Give me that back
if you don't want it.

410
00:19:30.821 --> 00:19:32.301
Shouldn't it be like
wrapped nicely?

411
00:19:32.388 --> 00:19:33.955
Reduce. reuse. recycle.

412
00:19:34.042 --> 00:19:35.522

So long ago. No way.

426
00:20:10.687 --> 00:20:12.733
Yeah. it was way back
in the old-timey days

427
00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.169
when they still had cocaine

428
00:20:14.256 --> 00:20:15.344
in the old cola.

429
00:20:15.431 --> 00:20:17.564
Okay. All right. Thank you.

430
00:20:19.043 --> 00:20:20.219
Come on. come on. come on.

431
00:20:21.655 --> 00:20:23.439
Hi. guys.

432
00:20:23.526 --> 00:20:26.312
Oh. God! Oh. no!
You don't have to!

433
00:20:26.399 --> 00:20:27.791
- Get up.
- Come on.

434
00:20:27.878 --> 00:20:29.924
- No. no. no!
- Get up. Come on.

435
00:20:30.011 --> 00:20:31.665
- Let's get a drink.
- Good to see you.

436
00:20:31.752 --> 00:20:33.232
- Sorry.
- No. here.

437
00:20:33.319 --> 00:20:35.146
What are you doing? I mean...

438
00:20:36.539 --> 00:20:38.715
Okay. I'm fine. I'm sorry.

439
00:20:43.807 --> 00:20:46.157
No more! No. no! You can't!
What are you doing?

440
00:20:46.245 --> 00:20:47.898
No. it's okay.
Just don't tell my boss.

441
00:20:47.985 --> 00:20:49.857
Oh. my God.
You're touching my breasts!

442
00:20:52.163 --> 00:20:55.863
Well. where did they go?
Oh. no.

443
00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:57.212
There!

444
00:20:57.299 --> 00:20:58.953
Tommy's with him.

445
00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.998
- Oh. my God.
- Tommy's-- Tommy's here.

446
00:21:01.085 --> 00:21:02.565
I thought he was in Thailand.

447
00:21:02.652 --> 00:21:05.002
Myanmar. actually.

448
00:21:05.089 --> 00:21:06.613
But that was just a stint.

449
00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.615
I spend most of my time
in Liberia

450
00:21:08.702 --> 00:21:09.964
setting up clinics.

451
00:21:10.051 --> 00:21:12.314
An unapologetic overachiever.
this guy.

452
00:21:12.401 --> 00:21:14.055
Oh. you want an overachiever?

453
00:21:14.142 --> 00:21:16.318
Our little Nora here.
she's got an MBA

454
00:21:16.405 --> 00:21:19.408
and a PhD in. uh. bio-something?

455
00:21:19.495 --> 00:21:22.150
Yeah.
Bioengineering and chemistry.

456
00:21:22.237 --> 00:21:25.762
I work in R&D now testing
cleaning agents and...

457
00:21:25.849 --> 00:21:28.591
It doesn't matter. So... GINNY: The hell it doesn't!

458
00:21:28.678 --> 00:21:31.377
You're a bleach stain away
from a Nobel Prize.

459
00:21:31.464 --> 00:21:32.508
Oh... No.

460
00:21:32.595 --> 00:21:34.989
The Tide Pen changed my life.

461
00:21:36.382 --> 00:21:37.948
It's good to see you. Nora.

462
00:21:38.035 --> 00:21:40.124
Oh! And good to see you too.

463
00:21:40.211 --> 00:21:42.126
Mary here's just as impressive.

464
00:21:42.213 --> 00:21:44.520
She's the best APRN
on the Eastern Seaboard.

465
00:21:44.607 --> 00:21:45.913
Your patients must love you.

466
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.523
You should see
her bedside manner.

467
00:21:49.133 --> 00:21:50.918
So. um. do--

468
00:21:51.005 --> 00:21:54.095
What have you been up to
the last few decades?

469
00:21:54.182 --> 00:21:56.576
Well. I spent most of
my time overseas working.

470
00:21:56.663 --> 00:21:58.055
but that takes a toll.

471
00:21:58.142 --> 00:21:59.970
So I'm teaching anatomy.

472
00:22:00.057 --> 00:22:01.494
At Johns Hopkins.

473
00:22:01.581 --> 00:22:03.626
Wow. Professor.

474
00:22:03.713 --> 00:22:05.498
Maybe you found
someone smart enough

475
00:22:05.585 --> 00:22:08.065
- to find his own nuts.
- Oh. whoa.

476
00:22:08.152 --> 00:22:11.025
If you'll excuse me. I'm gonna
dip into the punch bowl.

477
00:22:12.853 --> 00:22:14.768
Hasn't changed a bit.
has she?

478
00:22:14.855 --> 00:22:18.641
No. Still smells like
patchouli and lighter fluid.

479
00:22:18.728 --> 00:22:19.947
What are you doing
these days?

480
00:22:20.034 --> 00:22:21.340
You're looking at it.

481
00:22:21.427 --> 00:22:22.950
I'm gainfully unemployed.

482
00:22:23.037 --> 00:22:25.387
What are you gaining?
I'm sorry.

483
00:22:25.474 --> 00:22:27.607
My sanity. Oh.

484
00:22:27.694 --> 00:22:32.612
I finally retired
a few years back. Yeah.

485
00:22:32.699 --> 00:22:35.223
Yeah. How long have you
been married. Nora?

486
00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:37.965
Oh! Oh. 34 years.

487
00:22:38.052 --> 00:22:39.662
So it's serious.

488
00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.187
Uh. yes. it is.

489
00:22:43.274 --> 00:22:46.365
Was. I mean. He passed.

490
00:22:46.452 --> 00:22:48.192
I'm sorry. No.

491
00:22:48.279 --> 00:22:49.977
As am I.Thank you.

492
00:22:52.936 --> 00:22:55.591
Welcome. welcome. welcome

493
00:22:55.678 --> 00:22:58.681
to our first ever
Camp Pinnacle reunion!

494
00:23:02.946 --> 00:23:05.645
This is an exciting milestone
for us.

495
00:23:05.732 --> 00:23:07.211
But it's an opportunity
for you

496
00:23:07.298 --> 00:23:08.952
to get back to your roots.

497
00:23:09.039 --> 00:23:10.345
We've created a schedule

498
00:23:10.432 --> 00:23:12.347
to give you a week
of unencumbered fun.

499
00:23:12.434 --> 00:23:14.175
reconnecting with friends.

500
00:23:14.262 --> 00:23:16.569
Now. we have activities
all planned.

501
00:23:16.656 --> 00:23:19.136
so you can opt in or out
at your leisure.

502
00:23:19.223 --> 00:23:21.835
And we have a special treat
to wrap up the week.

503
00:23:21.922 --> 00:23:24.141
Ginny Moon is here

504
00:23:24.228 --> 00:23:27.144
to share her pearls of wisdom
as our closing speaker!

505
00:23:32.367 --> 00:23:35.631
- Did she tell you?
- No. She didn't tell me at all.

506
00:23:49.515 --> 00:23:51.865
<i>They like the name
Cleanie Greenie</i>

507
00:23:51.952 --> 00:23:53.562
<i>better than Cleanie Greens.</i>

508
00:23:53.649 --> 00:23:55.346
Cleanie Greenie?

509
00:23:55.434 --> 00:23:57.044
I mean. that sounds like something

510
00:23:57.131 --> 00:23:59.438
an idiot toddler
would come up with.

511
00:23:59.525 --> 00:24:01.396
Hello? Kris?

512
00:24:01.483 --> 00:24:04.181
<i>You have exceeded
your daily phone limit.</i>

513
00:24:04.268 --> 00:24:08.011
I need to get out of here!
Ugh!

514
00:24:12.189 --> 00:24:13.452
Come on!

515
00:24:16.846 --> 00:24:18.500
Oh. no!

516
00:24:22.112 --> 00:24:25.681
Hi there. Excuse me. Hello?
Uh. Vick. right?

517
00:24:25.768 --> 00:24:28.945
You're not-- You're not supposed
to be able to see me

518
00:24:29.032 --> 00:24:31.165
through this two-way glass.

519
00:24:31.252 --> 00:24:32.471
Well... Oh. damn it!

520
00:24:32.558 --> 00:24:33.907
They must have
installed it backwards!

521
00:24:33.994 --> 00:24:35.561
Are you sure you can see me?

522
00:24:35.648 --> 00:24:37.824
- You can?
- Yes. but I'd be very happy

523
00:24:37.911 --> 00:24:40.609
just to keep this
on the down low

524
00:24:40.696 --> 00:24:43.003
in exchange for my phone.

525
00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:44.831
I just want to get-- Okay.

526
00:24:44.918 --> 00:24:47.355
Ma'am. I have
a police-grade Taser.

527
00:24:47.442 --> 00:24:49.313
and I am not afraid
to use it.

528
00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.534
I will shove that Taser
so far up your you know what!

529
00:24:52.621 --> 00:24:54.275
Need reinforcement?
- What? Oh!

530
00:24:54.362 --> 00:24:56.190
Um. where did you come from?

531
00:24:56.277 --> 00:24:58.018
Well. originally
from Baltimore.

532
00:24:58.105 --> 00:25:00.542
but I've been here
for a half an hour.

533
00:25:00.629 --> 00:25:02.979
Oh. I was just. you know...

534
00:25:03.066 --> 00:25:06.548
Shoving a Taser so far up.
I know. I-I heard.

535
00:25:06.635 --> 00:25:09.725
Yeah. I mean. it sounded like
I said that.

536
00:25:09.812 --> 00:25:11.466
but I didn't
really say that.

537
00:25:11.553 --> 00:25:12.859
- Well. That's what I heard.
- I mean. okay.

538
00:25:12.946 --> 00:25:14.513
No. she said it.
- What?!

539
00:25:23.086 --> 00:25:25.045
Here. Try this.

540
00:25:25.132 --> 00:25:26.786
Ooh! Ooh-hoo!

541
00:25:26.873 --> 00:25:29.092
Yeah.
It's a bit of a sting. huh?

542
00:25:29.179 --> 00:25:31.007
- Yeah!
- It's made from emulsified

543
00:25:31.094 --> 00:25:32.618
jellyfish mesoglea.

544
00:25:32.705 --> 00:25:34.184
ethically harvested
by this farmer

545
00:25:34.271 --> 00:25:35.316
that I met in Namibia.

546
00:25:35.403 --> 00:25:36.578
Keep it.

547
00:25:36.665 --> 00:25:38.972
Papadou sends me one
every month.

548
00:25:39.059 --> 00:25:41.148
What are you drawing
over there?

549
00:25:41.235 --> 00:25:42.584
That's a great hobby.

550
00:25:42.671 --> 00:25:43.977
Let's see that masterpiece.

551
00:25:47.328 --> 00:25:48.634
Oh. um...

552
00:25:50.636 --> 00:25:52.681
- What is it?
- Well. it was just an idea

553
00:25:52.768 --> 00:25:53.943
that came to me.

554
00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:55.945
Can't you just
spend time with us?

555
00:25:56.032 --> 00:25:58.034
- And do what?
- That's it.

556
00:25:58.121 --> 00:25:59.906
That's the whole shebang.

557
00:25:59.993 --> 00:26:01.864
Just be present with us.

558
00:26:01.951 --> 00:26:04.519
Oh.

559
00:26:04.606 --> 00:26:06.565
I mean. what did you do

560
00:26:06.652 --> 00:26:08.044
when it was just you
and Leslie?

561
00:26:08.131 --> 00:26:09.742
Well. work.

562
00:26:09.829 --> 00:26:11.918
I mean. for fun.

563
00:26:12.005 --> 00:26:13.528
Work.

564
00:26:14.921 --> 00:26:16.836
No?

565
00:26:16.923 --> 00:26:17.924
Don't get mad.

566
00:26:18.011 --> 00:26:19.490
I love you.

567
00:26:19.578 --> 00:26:21.710
I love you. Oh. hey.

568
00:26:21.797 --> 00:26:23.538
I decided that we
could all use

569
00:26:23.625 --> 00:26:25.975
a little hydrotherapy
to unwind. you know.

570
00:26:26.062 --> 00:26:30.110
So I signed us all up
for a lazy river excursion.

571
00:26:30.197 --> 00:26:31.894
I didn't see that
in the catalog.

572
00:26:31.981 --> 00:26:33.548
No. no. no. no.
No. no.

573
00:26:33.635 --> 00:26:35.594
We're gonna get wet
tomorrow. Yeah.

574
00:26:35.681 --> 00:26:37.944
Yep. whoo-hoo-hoo!
I'm gonna stay dry!

575
00:26:40.642 --> 00:26:43.732
There's nothing lazy
about this river.

576
00:26:43.819 --> 00:26:46.126
They must have made a mistake
on the sign-up sheet.

577
00:26:46.213 --> 00:26:48.128
Or you misunderstood.

578
00:26:48.215 --> 00:26:50.609
- No way.
- Well. we could use

579
00:26:50.696 --> 00:26:52.436
some adventure.
get us out of our ruts.

580
00:26:52.523 --> 00:26:55.048
I can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

581
00:26:55.135 --> 00:26:57.050
- I'm going back to the cabin.
- Come on. Nora.

582
00:26:57.137 --> 00:26:59.705
- Don't you want to live a little?
- I sure do.

583
00:26:59.792 --> 00:27:02.098
Hence the staying on shore.

584
00:27:02.185 --> 00:27:03.839
Okay?

585
00:27:03.926 --> 00:27:05.798
Oh. God.

586
00:27:05.885 --> 00:27:08.670
Ladies! What a surprise.

587
00:27:08.757 --> 00:27:11.586
I certainly didn't take you
for the intrepid type.

588
00:27:11.673 --> 00:27:15.024
Yeah. Us three?
We're super adventurous.

589
00:27:15.111 --> 00:27:16.635
Right?

590
00:27:16.722 --> 00:27:19.159
This doesn't look too bad.
Yeah?

591
00:27:19.246 --> 00:27:21.074
Oh. this? This is nothing.

592
00:27:21.161 --> 00:27:22.902
We took a trip
to Chile together.

593
00:27:22.989 --> 00:27:24.817
Ooh!

594
00:27:24.904 --> 00:27:27.297
You know. Jane used to be
a rafting guide.

595
00:27:27.384 --> 00:27:29.038
Well. technically
a rafting expert.

596
00:27:29.125 --> 00:27:31.824
- Wow.
- Let me tell you. the Andes...

597
00:27:31.911 --> 00:27:34.043
- No joke.
- Yeah. well...

598
00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:36.132
- Nice outfits.
- Yeah. Thank you.

599
00:27:36.219 --> 00:27:37.743
- Bye.
- Thanks so much.

600
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:40.136
Well. if anyone needs
a flotation device.

601
00:27:40.223 --> 00:27:42.443
they've got six.

602
00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:44.532
Twelve counting
the butt cheeks.

603
00:27:44.619 --> 00:27:48.318
Oh. yes. let's go!
Oh. let's go to Chile!

604
00:27:48.405 --> 00:27:49.885
Stop. You've lost your mind.

605
00:27:49.972 --> 00:27:51.060
Nora. if they can do it.

606
00:27:51.147 --> 00:27:52.105
- we can do it.
- Okay!

607
00:27:52.192 --> 00:27:53.846
- It'll be great!
- Yes!

608
00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:07.076
Could we have asked
for a better day. ladies?

609
00:28:07.163 --> 00:28:10.253
Oh. Jimmy.
Ever the optimist. eh?

610
00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:12.952
Well. you live in paradise.
every day's a gift. right?

611
00:28:13.039 --> 00:28:16.042
I have to say.
I mean. this isn't awful.

612
00:28:16.129 --> 00:28:17.957
No. it's amazing!

613
00:28:21.134 --> 00:28:24.180
And one. and two...

614
00:28:24.267 --> 00:28:26.095
Sorry.

615
00:28:26.182 --> 00:28:27.314
Hang on. Ginny!

616
00:28:27.401 --> 00:28:29.185
And one... Hello!

617
00:28:29.272 --> 00:28:31.318
We're losing!
What can I do?

618
00:28:31.405 --> 00:28:33.842
It's not a competition.
ladies. right?

619
00:28:33.929 --> 00:28:36.192
It's about having fun!

620
00:28:36.279 --> 00:28:39.239
Looking good.
my aqua warriors!

621
00:28:39.326 --> 00:28:42.285
<i>♪ I see
The bad moon rising... ♪</i>

622
00:28:42.372 --> 00:28:44.374
Start paddling! Paddle!

623
00:28:44.461 --> 00:28:45.985
I'm paddling!

624
00:28:46.072 --> 00:28:47.813
Wait. are we supposed
to go over that?

625
00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:49.684
It's just a Class II.

626
00:28:56.299 --> 00:28:58.649
Nora!

627
00:28:58.737 --> 00:29:00.477
Take control.

628
00:29:00.564 --> 00:29:02.305
- Come on. grab it!
- You're supposed to be helping!

629
00:29:02.392 --> 00:29:04.743
I am helping her!

630
00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:06.527
Super kick! Super kick!

631
00:29:06.614 --> 00:29:09.095
- Grab her!
- Grab on! Come on!

632
00:29:09.182 --> 00:29:10.923
Grab on!
Come on!

633
00:29:12.576 --> 00:29:15.144
Grab on! Grab on. Nora!

634
00:29:15.231 --> 00:29:16.667
Oh. please! Please... MARY: Oh. come on!

635
00:29:16.755 --> 00:29:19.235
We got you! We got you!
Come on!

636
00:29:19.322 --> 00:29:21.934
All right!
That wasn't so bad.

637
00:29:22.021 --> 00:29:24.371
Come on. Push your legs.
Here we go!

638
00:29:24.458 --> 00:29:25.764
All right.

639
00:29:25.851 --> 00:29:28.636
- Give me her legs.
- Here we go. Here we go.

640
00:29:28.723 --> 00:29:30.072
Give me your legs.

641
00:29:30.159 --> 00:29:33.293
Oh. thank you.

642
00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:34.773
Nora!

643
00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:37.688
Yeah. yeah. It was so...

644
00:29:37.776 --> 00:29:39.734
Oh. God. I wish you could've
been there. Mike!

645
00:29:39.821 --> 00:29:41.127
<i>Yeah.</i>
The water.

646
00:29:41.214 --> 00:29:43.694
The water. it just
rushes and rushes.

647
00:29:43.782 --> 00:29:47.698
and we were-- Oh. God.
Oh. it's hard to describe.

648
00:29:47.786 --> 00:29:50.005
Hey. now that you're
all retired. maybe we can...

649
00:29:50.092 --> 00:29:51.920
<i>Ahem. Yeah. What?</i>

650
00:29:53.617 --> 00:29:55.532
Just. can you turn the TV down
just a little bit?

651
00:29:55.619 --> 00:29:57.099
<i>The game's almost done.</i>

652
00:29:59.014 --> 00:30:01.016
Uh. it's lights out here
anyway soon.

653
00:30:01.103 --> 00:30:02.235
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

654
00:30:02.322 --> 00:30:03.497
Yeah. I... <i>Yeah.</i>

655
00:30:03.584 --> 00:30:04.803
I'll call you tomorrow. okay?

656
00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:06.282
<i>All right. Yeah.</i>

657
00:30:06.369 --> 00:30:07.980
All right.
<i>Love you.</i>

658
00:30:08.067 --> 00:30:09.198
You too. <i>Okay.</i>

659
00:30:49.891 --> 00:30:53.242
Who's there? Hello?

660
00:30:53.329 --> 00:30:55.157
I know you're out there.

661
00:30:56.332 --> 00:30:57.899
Nora.

662
00:30:57.986 --> 00:30:59.640
- Oh! Oh. my God.
- It's me.

663
00:30:59.727 --> 00:31:01.294
Oh. Oh my goodness.

664
00:31:01.381 --> 00:31:03.470
What are you...?
What were you doing out there?

665
00:31:03.557 --> 00:31:05.559
Uh. trying
to get your attention.

666
00:31:05.646 --> 00:31:08.475
Tell me I didn't scare you.

667
00:31:08.562 --> 00:31:10.956
No. No. no. no. no.

668
00:31:11.043 --> 00:31:12.174
Be right there.

669
00:31:12.261 --> 00:31:13.393
Oh. dear.

670
00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.743
Wow. Um...

671
00:31:18.441 --> 00:31:22.184
- Hi.
- What are you doing up so late?

672
00:31:22.271 --> 00:31:23.664
Well. I couldn't sleep.

673
00:31:23.751 --> 00:31:26.319
I got up. went for a walk.

674
00:31:26.406 --> 00:31:29.757
saw the light.
saw you in here. and...

675
00:31:29.844 --> 00:31:31.150
Do you want to join me?

676
00:31:31.237 --> 00:31:32.934
Join you?

677
00:31:33.021 --> 00:31:35.632
For a walk in the woods
at night

678
00:31:35.719 --> 00:31:37.721
with a man
I hardly even know?

679
00:31:37.808 --> 00:31:39.462
Well. when you
put it that way.

680
00:31:39.549 --> 00:31:42.291
it actually sounds
kind of dicey. doesn't it?

681
00:31:42.378 --> 00:31:45.425
I don't know. I mean. I'm still
catching up on e-mails.

682
00:31:45.512 --> 00:31:47.122
And not having my phone

683
00:31:47.209 --> 00:31:49.995
is just kind of putting me
so far behind.

684
00:31:50.082 --> 00:31:51.953
Don't they keep them
locked up in there?

685
00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:54.869
- Yeah.
- Well. I'll get it for you.

686
00:31:54.956 --> 00:31:58.960
Really? But how are you
gonna do that?

687
00:31:59.047 --> 00:32:01.528
Um... Oh.

688
00:32:01.615 --> 00:32:04.748
- Titanium.
- But we're breaking in. I don't--

689
00:32:04.835 --> 00:32:08.187
No. we're walking in.

690
00:32:08.274 --> 00:32:10.624
We're gonna get in
so much trouble.

691
00:32:10.711 --> 00:32:12.321
It's good to see you. Nora.

692
00:32:12.408 --> 00:32:14.280
Oh. my God.

693
00:32:14.367 --> 00:32:17.065
- Uh. yeah.
- Sassafras. is that the name?

694
00:32:17.152 --> 00:32:18.414
I know.
I'm looking for it. Yes.

695
00:32:18.501 --> 00:32:19.938
I've got--
I don't know.

696
00:32:20.025 --> 00:32:21.983
Oh! Oh...

697
00:32:24.638 --> 00:32:26.205
Oh! Good!
Yes!

698
00:32:26.292 --> 00:32:28.207
- See? Did it!
- There. Good.

699
00:32:28.294 --> 00:32:30.905
We did it. You're bad.

700
00:32:30.992 --> 00:32:34.300
Hmm. Too much credit.
I'm semi-bad.

701
00:32:34.387 --> 00:32:35.954
Mmm.

702
00:32:40.393 --> 00:32:42.830
What are you doing?!
- Oh! Oh! Ah!

703
00:32:44.397 --> 00:32:47.095
Whoa!
- Ah. Um...

704
00:32:47.182 --> 00:32:49.358
An inside job. huh?

705
00:32:49.445 --> 00:32:51.795
Hi. Are you all right?

706
00:32:51.882 --> 00:32:54.189
The boss isn't gonna be
happy about this.

707
00:33:01.718 --> 00:33:03.894
You are going to have
to replace that monitor.

708
00:33:03.982 --> 00:33:06.506
Yeah. okay.
I'll go back to 1994

709
00:33:06.593 --> 00:33:07.986
and see if I can find one.

710
00:33:08.073 --> 00:33:11.598
Oh! Is this a joke to you?

711
00:33:11.685 --> 00:33:13.904
Look. this was my fault. okay?

712
00:33:13.992 --> 00:33:15.906
She actually
tried to stop me.

713
00:33:15.994 --> 00:33:19.736
So let her go and just cuff me.

714
00:33:19.823 --> 00:33:21.434
Okay. I can do that.

715
00:33:21.521 --> 00:33:22.696
'Cause I got these.

716
00:33:22.783 --> 00:33:24.306
- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah. I'll cuff you.

717
00:33:24.393 --> 00:33:25.568
Do you see
how nervous I am?

718
00:33:25.655 --> 00:33:27.570
He's being so sassy to me!

719
00:33:27.657 --> 00:33:29.398
You can't be like that to me!

720
00:33:29.485 --> 00:33:31.183
Okay.
Okay.

721
00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:33.228
- Let's be patient with them.
- Okay.

722
00:33:33.315 --> 00:33:35.361
- She'll calm down.
- Yes. that's it.

723
00:33:35.448 --> 00:33:36.927
Are you zoned out now?

724
00:33:37.015 --> 00:33:39.017
Yeah. In a good way.
Good zone.

725
00:33:39.104 --> 00:33:41.497
Maybe it's time for us
to just say goodbye...

726
00:33:41.584 --> 00:33:42.890
Yeah....and appreciate

727
00:33:42.977 --> 00:33:44.761
- what you've given us. okay?
- Yeah.

728
00:33:44.848 --> 00:33:47.851
We should all go out together.
maybe on a weekend?

729
00:33:47.938 --> 00:33:49.462
Yeah?
- That is such a great idea.

730
00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:51.420
- Yeah. That would be good.
- I wouldn't mind that.

731
00:33:51.507 --> 00:33:52.813
We could go to Chili's.

732
00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.206
Uh. Chili's... They all know me there.

733
00:33:54.293 --> 00:33:55.468
- Oh. they do?
- Uh-huh.

734
00:33:55.555 --> 00:33:57.252
Some of the best food
ever. right?

735
00:33:57.339 --> 00:33:58.688
Yeah!
Southwestern eggrolls.

736
00:33:58.775 --> 00:34:00.168
Yeah. yeah. Wow.
- Gosh!

737
00:34:00.255 --> 00:34:02.170
- They are delicious.
- I can just house

738
00:34:02.257 --> 00:34:04.216
the whole plate
of those. you know?

739
00:34:04.303 --> 00:34:06.087
I bet you could.
I bet you could.

740
00:34:06.174 --> 00:34:07.523
What is that
supposed to mean?

741
00:34:16.402 --> 00:34:18.056
Oh. my God.

742
00:34:21.146 --> 00:34:22.799
Oh. sorry! Ha-ha!

743
00:34:22.886 --> 00:34:24.192
Where the hell have you been?

744
00:34:24.279 --> 00:34:25.585
We were worried sick!

745
00:34:25.672 --> 00:34:27.108
I was just. uh...

746
00:34:27.195 --> 00:34:29.719
Well. Stevie D and I.
we got into some trouble.

747
00:34:29.806 --> 00:34:32.026
- What kind of trouble?
- Tell us everything!

748
00:34:32.113 --> 00:34:34.768
If you kissed. you sure
as hell better tell!

749
00:34:34.855 --> 00:34:36.813
Please let us
live vicariously.

750
00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.512
He took me to the security
office to get my phone.

751
00:34:39.599 --> 00:34:41.688
Oh.

752
00:34:41.775 --> 00:34:43.081
And then you kissed?

753
00:34:43.168 --> 00:34:46.214
No! We broke in!

754
00:34:46.301 --> 00:34:47.563
With a credit card.

755
00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:49.217
And then he found my phone.

756
00:34:49.304 --> 00:34:51.045
- And then you kissed!
- No. no. no.

757
00:34:51.132 --> 00:34:53.569
But. well. there was
a moment...

758
00:34:53.656 --> 00:34:56.006
- Ooh. a moment!
- But then we were caught!

759
00:34:56.094 --> 00:34:57.704
By Vick!

760
00:34:57.791 --> 00:35:01.403
That traitor! She's here
to protect and to serve.

761
00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:03.188
not buzzkill and cockblock!

762
00:35:03.275 --> 00:35:04.972
So when did you...?

763
00:35:05.059 --> 00:35:07.583
There was no kiss.
It was invigorating. though.

764
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:10.238
And he's such a gentleman.
my God.

765
00:35:10.325 --> 00:35:13.720
Two peas in a celibate pod.

766
00:35:13.807 --> 00:35:15.417
You're going to have
to make the first move

767
00:35:15.504 --> 00:35:16.723
if you want to get anywhere.

768
00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:18.942
Still. this is
the most exciting thing

769
00:35:19.029 --> 00:35:20.727
that's happened to any of us

770
00:35:20.814 --> 00:35:22.468
since Gin told us about
her threesome

771
00:35:22.555 --> 00:35:24.905
with Tony Robbins backstage
at Super Soul Sunday.

772
00:35:24.992 --> 00:35:28.648
I never said that!
I signed an NDA.

773
00:35:28.735 --> 00:35:30.998
Oh. wait. wait.
Who was the third?

774
00:35:31.085 --> 00:35:32.217
Was it Oprah?

775
00:35:32.304 --> 00:35:33.827
It wasn't <i>not</i> Oprah.

776
00:35:35.045 --> 00:35:36.525
Sometimes I wish Mike

777
00:35:36.612 --> 00:35:37.961
would just--Die.

778
00:35:38.048 --> 00:35:40.747
No! It's just that...

779
00:35:40.834 --> 00:35:43.924
maybe I wish
that I didn't get married.

780
00:35:45.404 --> 00:35:47.884
Like you. You're lucky.

781
00:35:47.971 --> 00:35:49.408
Well. it wasn't about luck.

782
00:35:49.495 --> 00:35:51.061
I chose to stay single.

783
00:35:51.149 --> 00:35:52.454
You did?

784
00:35:52.541 --> 00:35:54.891
Don't get me wrong.
I love men. But I...

785
00:35:54.978 --> 00:35:58.765
I just love
my independence more.

786
00:35:58.852 --> 00:36:00.984
I'm sure marriage works
for plenty of people.

787
00:36:01.071 --> 00:36:05.075
but I'm just too damn happy
being on my own.

788
00:36:05.163 --> 00:36:07.643
Do you ever get lonely. though?

789
00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:09.297
No.
No?

790
00:36:09.384 --> 00:36:11.256
Not since I hit menopause.

791
00:36:11.343 --> 00:36:12.518
Oh.

792
00:36:12.605 --> 00:36:13.693
You?
Me?

793
00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:16.174
Yeah.
Oh. yeah.

794
00:36:16.261 --> 00:36:19.220
Sometimes. Yeah. Hmm.

795
00:36:19.307 --> 00:36:21.744
Well. I-I guess
sometimes I do too.

796
00:36:21.831 --> 00:36:26.967
but it's like 80% happy
and 20% longing.

797
00:36:27.054 --> 00:36:29.187
You know.
instead of 20% happy

798
00:36:29.274 --> 00:36:31.928
and 80% longing
for less bullshit.

799
00:36:32.015 --> 00:36:33.843
Less of the. "Where are you?

800
00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:35.671
Why won't you call?
Where's dinner?"

801
00:36:35.758 --> 00:36:40.328
You know. and I just feel that
that 20% of loneliness.

802
00:36:40.415 --> 00:36:42.069
hmm. you know.
I just don't need

803
00:36:42.156 --> 00:36:44.593
a romantic partner
to fill that.

804
00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:46.116
That's true.

805
00:36:46.204 --> 00:36:49.119
I-- I'm not lonely
when I'm with you two.

806
00:37:01.654 --> 00:37:02.611
Gin!

807
00:37:02.698 --> 00:37:04.309
- Whoa!
- Wake up!

808
00:37:04.396 --> 00:37:07.964
Your alarm has been
going off for an hour.

809
00:37:08.051 --> 00:37:10.315
What do you ladies
think about

810
00:37:10.402 --> 00:37:13.753
hitting up the old
Sky Canopy course?

811
00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.755
I think I've had
my fill of adventure.

812
00:37:15.842 --> 00:37:17.757
You barely dipped a toe in.

813
00:37:17.844 --> 00:37:20.629
I dipped considerably
more than a toe in.

814
00:37:20.716 --> 00:37:22.152
thank you very much.

815
00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.502
You know what?
What?

816
00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:25.895
Why don't you choose
today's activity. huh?

817
00:37:25.982 --> 00:37:29.464
Excellent idea!
What's the plan. Mare?

818
00:37:29.551 --> 00:37:31.249
Today is your day!

819
00:37:31.336 --> 00:37:33.207
There's a pottery workshop
at noon.

820
00:37:33.294 --> 00:37:35.078
- No. No.
- Oh. No. no. no.

821
00:37:35.165 --> 00:37:37.211
Sorry. I'm out on that one.

822
00:37:37.298 --> 00:37:41.128
Well. better luck next time.
Robin Hood.

823
00:37:41.215 --> 00:37:42.956
All right. Sighted the target.

824
00:37:46.133 --> 00:37:48.222
Oh! Oh. my God! I'm sorry.

825
00:37:48.309 --> 00:37:49.702
- Saved it!
- Hi.

826
00:37:49.789 --> 00:37:51.486
- Still good.
- Oh. still good.

827
00:37:51.573 --> 00:37:54.359
- Do you have any tips?
- I'm not an expert.

828
00:37:54.446 --> 00:37:57.579
Or an intermediate. I've never
actually touched a bow.

829
00:37:57.666 --> 00:38:00.060
It seems like they're a bit
short-staffed around here.

830
00:38:00.147 --> 00:38:01.409
wouldn't you say?
No. I--

831
00:38:01.496 --> 00:38:03.281
- No?
- I just got transferred

832
00:38:03.368 --> 00:38:06.109
out of water sports.
Making moves. Lateral moves.

833
00:38:06.196 --> 00:38:07.894
Did it have anything to do

834
00:38:07.981 --> 00:38:09.417
with ejecting Nora
from our raft?

835
00:38:09.504 --> 00:38:11.680
That may have been
a part of it. Yeah.

836
00:38:11.767 --> 00:38:13.291
I also set
the boat house on fire.

837
00:38:13.378 --> 00:38:15.684
I saw a beaver
building a lodge

838
00:38:15.771 --> 00:38:17.338
out of the wreckage. So...

839
00:38:17.425 --> 00:38:18.600
Uh-huh.
- Win-win.

840
00:38:18.687 --> 00:38:20.515
- Right.
- I wouldn't mind

841
00:38:20.602 --> 00:38:21.908
shooting another one.
if you don't mind.

842
00:38:21.995 --> 00:38:23.213
Thanks so much.
It's really great.

843
00:38:23.301 --> 00:38:24.998
Okay. ready? There we go.

844
00:38:25.085 --> 00:38:27.000
- Now. if I just-- Shut up.
- Turn it around. sweetheart.

845
00:38:27.087 --> 00:38:29.698
You guys always--
You're so... Okay.

846
00:38:29.785 --> 00:38:31.439
I got it. Geez. man.

847
00:38:31.526 --> 00:38:33.833
Incoming! Take cover.

848
00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.791
You ladies mind
if we join you?

849
00:38:35.878 --> 00:38:38.359
- Whoa! Swing it around. Nora!
- Oh. my God.

850
00:38:38.446 --> 00:38:40.405
I should've gone
to pottery class.

851
00:38:40.492 --> 00:38:43.321
Look. we're
very self-sufficient.

852
00:38:43.408 --> 00:38:45.671
No mansplaining
necessary. Thanks.

853
00:38:45.758 --> 00:38:47.890
My battle scar
would say otherwise.

854
00:38:47.977 --> 00:38:50.110
Oh. my God!
You still have a scar?

855
00:38:50.197 --> 00:38:53.635
I'm sorry. I should've used
sutures instead of super glue.

856
00:38:53.722 --> 00:38:55.028
You were 12.

857
00:38:55.115 --> 00:38:58.553
Well. you ladies enjoy
the patriarchy.

858
00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.555
Oh. excuse me.
I mean archery.

859
00:39:00.642 --> 00:39:02.427
I'm gonna go
work on my speech.

860
00:39:04.167 --> 00:39:06.735
Would you wanna see
if the pottery class

861
00:39:06.822 --> 00:39:08.563
would take some newcomers?

862
00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:10.173
Absolutely.

863
00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:16.702
So. Nora... Yes?

864
00:39:16.789 --> 00:39:19.574
You're very.
very good at this.

865
00:39:19.661 --> 00:39:20.880
Oh. shh! I'm...

866
00:39:20.967 --> 00:39:22.708
Yeah. I know.
I'm-- I'm kidding.

867
00:39:22.795 --> 00:39:25.101
But maybe
with a few pointers.

868
00:39:25.188 --> 00:39:26.451
- you know. a few tips.
- Mm. okay.

869
00:39:26.538 --> 00:39:28.322
- Somebody say tips?
- Uh-huh. Yeah. tips.

870
00:39:28.409 --> 00:39:30.106
Uh. private conversation. but...

871
00:39:30.193 --> 00:39:31.499
- Yeah.
- Let's keep it that way.

872
00:39:31.586 --> 00:39:33.762
- Bye. Jimmy. Bye-bye. Thanks.
- Good. good.

873
00:39:33.849 --> 00:39:35.285
No. I think. uh...

874
00:39:35.373 --> 00:39:37.853
I think there's a future here.

875
00:39:44.643 --> 00:39:46.209
Oh. yeah. That's slippery.

876
00:39:46.296 --> 00:39:48.081

880

That's okay.

883

Stop!

889
00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:26.206
Looks like
an Ice cream cone.

890
00:40:27.555 --> 00:40:28.948
You're supposed
to shape it.

891
00:40:29.035 --> 00:40:30.297
Oh. no! Oh!
Uh-oh!

892
00:40:34.388 --> 00:40:35.998
I hope you're not
staring at my ass.

893
00:40:36.085 --> 00:40:39.175
Huh? No! No.

894
00:40:39.262 --> 00:40:41.003
I was checking out
your technique.

895
00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:42.309
I mean. my God.

896
00:40:42.396 --> 00:40:43.963
Okay. It's just
I get a little nervous...

897
00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:46.052
Oh. Okay. I understand....with you standing

898
00:40:46.139 --> 00:40:47.575
right behind me.

899
00:40:47.662 --> 00:40:48.968
It's a fabulous technique actually.

900
00:40:49.055 --> 00:40:50.056
Eight out of ten.

901
00:40:51.753 --> 00:40:53.538
- Wow!
- All right. I'll take an 8.

902
00:40:53.625 --> 00:40:54.713
Okay.

903
00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.410
Let's see
what you can do. Nora.

904
00:40:56.497 --> 00:40:59.892
Oh. okay. Fine. Oh.

905
00:40:59.979 --> 00:41:01.720
So... So. thank you.

906
00:41:01.807 --> 00:41:02.982
- All right.
- Do you think--?

907
00:41:03.069 --> 00:41:04.766
- Well. you look good.
- Uh-huh.

908
00:41:04.853 --> 00:41:06.333
But your form...

909
00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:08.248
And now let's--
Let's work with the bow.

910
00:41:08.335 --> 00:41:10.380
- Mm-hmm.
- I want-- I want you to...

911
00:41:10.468 --> 00:41:12.121
You don't mind me...?No. no. That's fine.

912
00:41:12.208 --> 00:41:13.514
I know
what you're thinking.

913
00:41:13.601 --> 00:41:15.908
Okay. you're thinking.
"Wow. This is a move."

914
00:41:15.995 --> 00:41:18.606
This is not a move.
'Cause I don't have moves.

915
00:41:18.693 --> 00:41:20.434
I'm just...
I'm just trying to help.

916
00:41:20.521 --> 00:41:22.305
- Okay?
- Okay.

917
00:41:22.392 --> 00:41:24.220
Now let's just bring
this elbow

918
00:41:24.307 --> 00:41:26.527
- up this way. okay?
- Mm-hmm.

919
00:41:26.614 --> 00:41:29.356
Now let's focus
on our breathing. okay?

920
00:41:29.443 --> 00:41:32.490
Nice and easy.
Nice and easy. Inhale.

921
00:41:33.926 --> 00:41:38.017
And exhale.
Focus on the target.

922
00:41:38.104 --> 00:41:40.846
Slowly bring
the drawstring back.

923
00:41:42.761 --> 00:41:45.154
And... release.

924
00:41:46.765 --> 00:41:49.811
I can't believe...
We did it!

925
00:41:49.898 --> 00:41:52.074
- We did it!
- I wasn't expecting that!

926
00:42:09.875 --> 00:42:11.180
Thank you.

927
00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.925
Oh. dear.

928
00:42:17.012 --> 00:42:18.013
What?

929
00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:19.101
Where did you get that?

930
00:42:19.188 --> 00:42:20.450
Bargain Republic?

931
00:42:20.538 --> 00:42:22.148
- What?
- I'd never have approved that.

932
00:42:22.235 --> 00:42:23.889
Martha's gonna have
hell to pay

933
00:42:23.976 --> 00:42:25.325
- if she put that in.
- I had it

934
00:42:25.412 --> 00:42:28.371
in my "in case of an emergency"
bag. okay?

935
00:42:28.458 --> 00:42:29.938
We're trying to get you laid.

936
00:42:30.025 --> 00:42:31.331
not promoted
to mid-management.

937
00:42:31.418 --> 00:42:33.159
- Laid. Gin? Really?
- What?

938
00:42:33.246 --> 00:42:35.291
Banged? Bedded? Schtupped?

939
00:42:35.378 --> 00:42:37.772
Is anybody really
having sex anymore?

940
00:42:37.859 --> 00:42:38.947
Oh. Mare. come on.

941
00:42:39.034 --> 00:42:40.558
I'm having sex right now.

942
00:42:40.645 --> 00:42:42.124
Aah! Oh. God!

943
00:42:42.211 --> 00:42:44.213
Don't touch me
with those things.

944
00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:46.868
Maybe you should get
out of your comfort zone.

945
00:42:46.955 --> 00:42:49.871
And by "comfort zone."
I mean your marriage.

946
00:42:49.958 --> 00:42:51.438
I heard that.

947
00:42:51.525 --> 00:42:53.440
You don't have to be forced
to keep a promise

948
00:42:53.527 --> 00:42:55.050
you made 45 years ago

949
00:42:55.137 --> 00:42:57.009
if it's making you miserable.

950
00:42:57.096 --> 00:43:00.099
And that goes for
relationships and careers.

951
00:43:00.186 --> 00:43:01.579
No. no.

952
00:43:01.666 --> 00:43:05.017
Couldn't you at least
let me do something?

953
00:43:07.802 --> 00:43:10.544
- Nora!
- That bad. huh? Really?

954
00:43:10.631 --> 00:43:11.806
- No!
- Really?

955
00:43:11.893 --> 00:43:13.939
- Hot!
- I mean. who is that?

956
00:43:14.026 --> 00:43:16.855
So you like it?
And you doubted me.

957
00:43:16.942 --> 00:43:18.117
Yeah. I-I...

958
00:43:18.204 --> 00:43:20.685
Well. I do look not bad.

959
00:43:20.772 --> 00:43:22.164
No. you look hot!

960
00:43:22.251 --> 00:43:24.776
Better than hot.
You look like a bad bitch.

961
00:43:24.863 --> 00:43:26.299
- A bad-- What?
- Say it with me.

962
00:43:26.386 --> 00:43:27.648
Say it with you."I am..."

963
00:43:27.735 --> 00:43:29.171
I am.

964
00:43:29.258 --> 00:43:30.390
"...a bad bitch."

965
00:43:30.477 --> 00:43:31.826
I'm not gonna say that.

966
00:43:31.913 --> 00:43:33.349
Why would I call myself a...

967
00:43:33.436 --> 00:43:35.395
We have reclaimed
that word

968
00:43:35.482 --> 00:43:37.745
- for decades. Say it!
- I think you should say it.

969
00:43:37.832 --> 00:43:39.355
It's just
positive affirmations.

970
00:43:39.442 --> 00:43:41.357
- Okay. fine!
- You're not a gentle bitch.

971
00:43:41.444 --> 00:43:42.532
I am a...

972
00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:44.143
bad...

973
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:46.232
bad. bad bitch.

974
00:43:46.319 --> 00:43:48.103
- No. not good?
- That sounds sexy.

975
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:49.583
Okay. not that.
I am a bad bitch.

976
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:51.541
- Say it like you mean it.
- I'm just a bad bitch!

977
00:43:51.629 --> 00:43:53.631
- Is that good?
- Say it like you mean it.

978
00:43:53.718 --> 00:43:56.111
I am a <i>bad</i> bitch!

979
00:43:56.198 --> 00:43:58.113
Bad bitch!

980
00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:59.375
- You scared me!
- I scared me!

981
00:43:59.462 --> 00:44:01.116
- Okay. You say it.
- I'm a bad bitch.

982
00:44:01.203 --> 00:44:03.379
- Get your... in that chair.
- I'm a bad bitch.

983
00:44:03.466 --> 00:44:04.598
Ooh. look at her. Ooh!

984
00:44:04.685 --> 00:44:06.121
What-- Where you going?

985
00:44:06.208 --> 00:44:07.253
Do I walk like that?

986
00:44:13.651 --> 00:44:16.654
Your bone structure is... Oh... Oh!

987
00:44:16.741 --> 00:44:18.699
Then why do I need
a ton and a half of makeup

988
00:44:18.786 --> 00:44:21.310
- to make me look presentable?
- That is so not true!

989
00:44:21.397 --> 00:44:24.183
You don't.
This isn't about makeup.

990
00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:26.185
Or how to look
for anyone else.

991
00:44:26.272 --> 00:44:28.927
It's-- It's about
feeling cared for.

992
00:44:29.014 --> 00:44:31.146
Been a while since I felt that.

993
00:44:31.233 --> 00:44:33.453
Me too.

994
00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:35.542
We've got a lot of
amazing years ahead of us.

995
00:44:35.629 --> 00:44:37.675
So we can always make time

996
00:44:37.762 --> 00:44:40.416
to have fun
and pamper ourselves.

997
00:44:40.503 --> 00:44:41.940
Ooh!

998
00:44:43.811 --> 00:44:45.465
If you don't take ownership.

999
00:44:45.552 --> 00:44:47.075
you'll always be weak.

1000
00:44:47.162 --> 00:44:50.905
I'm responsible for
the way others treat me.

1001
00:44:50.992 --> 00:44:53.342
So sad.

1002
00:44:53.429 --> 00:44:56.476
Thank you. Thank you.

1003
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.785
All right. so...

1004
00:45:00.872 --> 00:45:04.745
who else is ready to get their
shit together with Ginny Moon?

1005
00:45:04.832 --> 00:45:06.834
Jane Goodman!
Come on down!

1006
00:45:06.921 --> 00:45:09.010
Well. this should be interesting.

1007
00:45:11.317 --> 00:45:12.579
Okay. sit down.

1008
00:45:12.666 --> 00:45:14.015
So. what's your problem?

1009
00:45:14.102 --> 00:45:16.670
Actually.
I don't have a problem.

1010
00:45:16.757 --> 00:45:18.150
I'm just such a fan.

1011
00:45:18.237 --> 00:45:19.978
Oh. Hmm.

1012
00:45:20.065 --> 00:45:22.676
So. what you're
telling me is you're...

1013
00:45:22.763 --> 00:45:24.852
Happy. Mm-hmm.
For the most part.

1014
00:45:24.939 --> 00:45:27.507
- Oh. for the most part.
- Mm-hmm.

1015
00:45:27.594 --> 00:45:28.987
Which parts aren't happy?

1016
00:45:29.074 --> 00:45:31.119
What about JP?

1017
00:45:31.206 --> 00:45:33.861
Her son was arrested
for defacing a public monument.

1018
00:45:33.948 --> 00:45:35.645
He was on bath salts!

1019
00:45:35.733 --> 00:45:37.691
She told me she was
waiting for Evelyn to pass.

1020
00:45:37.778 --> 00:45:39.258
so she can swoop in
on her husband.

1021
00:45:39.345 --> 00:45:40.607
That was a joke. I was kidding!

1022
00:45:40.694 --> 00:45:42.478
I'm married. Happily.

1023
00:45:42.565 --> 00:45:45.090
We are the picture
of marital bliss.

1024
00:45:45.177 --> 00:45:47.222
I am so lucky. Blessed.

1025
00:45:47.309 --> 00:45:48.920
Grateful. Always.

1026
00:45:49.007 --> 00:45:50.878
Are you?

1027
00:45:50.965 --> 00:45:53.011
It sounds like
you're hiding behind

1028
00:45:53.098 --> 00:45:56.057
a lot of socially-sanctioned
hashtags.

1029
00:46:06.546 --> 00:46:08.504
Okay. fine! Fine.

1030
00:46:08.591 --> 00:46:10.245
I haven't had sex
with my husband

1031
00:46:10.332 --> 00:46:13.596
since I started experiencing
age-related pubic hair loss.

1032
00:46:13.683 --> 00:46:15.555
And. yes. it's a thing.

1033
00:46:15.642 --> 00:46:17.992
My arm Spanx are
cutting off my circulation.

1034
00:46:18.079 --> 00:46:20.908
My hands are numb
and this freaking fire

1035
00:46:20.995 --> 00:46:24.259
is melting my face tapes!

1036
00:46:24.346 --> 00:46:26.914
I'm just so sick...

1037
00:46:27.001 --> 00:46:29.830
of trying to be pretty!

1038
00:46:29.917 --> 00:46:32.267
Looking for approval
from people I don't even like!

1039
00:46:32.354 --> 00:46:35.096
Damn it!
Get off of there!

1040
00:46:40.798 --> 00:46:42.060
Wow.

1041
00:46:42.147 --> 00:46:44.497
Jane...

1042
00:46:44.584 --> 00:46:46.455
what does that feel like.

1043
00:46:46.542 --> 00:46:48.153
to be vulnerable like that.

1044
00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:51.678
to just be plain old Jane?

1045
00:46:53.027 --> 00:46:54.855
What did you say?

1046
00:46:54.942 --> 00:46:57.423
Let's all give Jane
a big hand.

1047
00:46:57.510 --> 00:47:00.426
Thank you. Yeah.

1048
00:47:00.513 --> 00:47:03.995
And. uh. we better
move this along.

1049
00:47:04.082 --> 00:47:05.953
Thank you. Jane.
Thank you. Jane.

1050
00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:07.912
Uh...
Um. can she

1051
00:47:07.999 --> 00:47:09.435
come back
and sit up there with--?

1052
00:47:09.522 --> 00:47:10.828
Would you rather be sitting

1053
00:47:10.915 --> 00:47:12.003
with somebody else
at this point?

1054
00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:13.787
No. I...Okay. It's all right.

1055
00:47:13.874 --> 00:47:16.355
Oh! Thank you. Go.
There you go. Jane.

1056
00:47:16.442 --> 00:47:18.183
Wow. Wow.

1057
00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:19.662
How could you
hurt Jane's feelings?

1058
00:47:19.749 --> 00:47:21.316
She'll be fine.
Some tough love.

1059
00:47:21.403 --> 00:47:22.840
and she'll come back stronger.

1060
00:47:22.927 --> 00:47:25.407
Let's celebrate.
What'll it be?

1061
00:47:25.494 --> 00:47:27.888
I've got red. white or tequila.

1062
00:47:27.975 --> 00:47:30.630
No. no. I haven't had
this much to drink

1063
00:47:30.717 --> 00:47:33.546
- since college. Oh!
- Oh. no!

1064
00:47:33.633 --> 00:47:34.808
- Are you okay?
- No. no. no!

1065
00:47:34.895 --> 00:47:37.463
Don't go to bed!
Don't go to bed!

1066
00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:39.987
You can't sleep.

1067
00:47:40.074 --> 00:47:41.946
No. That got me
all pumped up.

1068
00:47:42.033 --> 00:47:45.036
Um. let me do
my keynote for you.

1069
00:47:50.171 --> 00:47:52.173
Oh. I'm sorry!
Oh. yes. of course.

1070
00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:53.740
The-- You're gonna do
the keynote.

1071
00:47:53.827 --> 00:47:56.177
Attention. Attention.

1072
00:47:56.264 --> 00:47:58.788
Real eyes...

1073
00:47:58.876 --> 00:48:00.442
realize...

1074
00:48:00.529 --> 00:48:03.097
real lies.

1075
00:48:03.184 --> 00:48:04.882
And you're all lying!

1076
00:48:04.969 --> 00:48:08.363
To yourselves. to others.

1077
00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:11.018
Only the truth
will set you free.

1078
00:48:11.105 --> 00:48:13.586
- That's true.
- No. I'm not done. No. I'm...

1079
00:48:13.673 --> 00:48:16.763
Wait a minute. Okay.
Here it is. I am Ginny Moon.

1080
00:48:16.850 --> 00:48:20.114
and I'm here
to cut through your bullshit

1081
00:48:20.201 --> 00:48:24.031
so you're nothing but
a quivering husk of truth.

1082
00:48:24.118 --> 00:48:26.338
What does that even mean?

1083
00:48:26.425 --> 00:48:28.253
No. it's-- It's aggressive.

1084
00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:29.863
It's a little aggressive.

1085
00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:31.734
but I think what she
is trying to get

1086
00:48:31.821 --> 00:48:33.954
her audience to do is to tap
into their own vulnerability.

1087
00:48:34.041 --> 00:48:36.000
Oh. blech. you can't be
subtle with these people.

1088
00:48:36.087 --> 00:48:39.960
I'm gonna
lobotomize their lies.

1089
00:48:40.047 --> 00:48:41.135
Oh. that's really great.

1090
00:48:41.222 --> 00:48:42.397
I think I should
write that down.

1091
00:48:42.484 --> 00:48:44.617
- Isn't that great?
- Speechless!

1092
00:48:44.704 --> 00:48:46.053
Good night. girls.

1093
00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:48.969
Ginny. I think
it'd be stronger

1094
00:48:49.056 --> 00:48:51.972
if you just speak
from your heart. girl.

1095
00:48:52.059 --> 00:48:54.540
Pull on some of
the camp experiences

1096
00:48:54.627 --> 00:48:55.802
that you've had.

1097
00:48:55.889 --> 00:48:57.717
People respond to that.

1098
00:48:57.804 --> 00:48:59.284
Thanks. little lamb.

1099
00:48:59.371 --> 00:49:02.591
I really wasn't looking
to workshop this.

1100
00:49:02.678 --> 00:49:04.637
Can we just turn off the light?

1101
00:49:04.724 --> 00:49:06.204
Did you call me a lamb?

1102
00:49:06.291 --> 00:49:08.380
Oh!

1103
00:49:15.909 --> 00:49:17.215
Come on.

1104
00:49:17.302 --> 00:49:20.609
We'll bring back
a plate for her.

1105
00:49:20.696 --> 00:49:23.830
What are you two
doing up so early?

1106
00:49:23.917 --> 00:49:25.049
It's 10 o'clock.

1107
00:49:25.136 --> 00:49:26.485
We're about
to miss breakfast.

1108
00:49:26.572 --> 00:49:27.703
What? Oh. my God! Yeah.

1109
00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:29.662
Let me get my shoes.
Yeah. fine.

1110
00:49:42.153 --> 00:49:43.589
Good morning.

1111
00:49:43.676 --> 00:49:47.549
I tied on one too many
nightcaps last night.

1112
00:49:47.636 --> 00:49:51.336
Oh. my. You ladies
look bright-eyed.

1113
00:49:51.423 --> 00:49:53.120
Mary!

1114
00:49:54.861 --> 00:49:56.776
Mike?

1115
00:49:56.863 --> 00:49:59.083
Uh. what are you doing here?

1116
00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:02.086
I... wasn't able
to reach you.

1117
00:50:02.173 --> 00:50:05.089
I just didn't know
if anything were...

1118
00:50:05.176 --> 00:50:08.962
Or if something
was wrong.

1119
00:50:09.049 --> 00:50:11.225
Tommy.
Mike.

1120
00:50:11.312 --> 00:50:12.835
Good to meet you.

1121
00:50:12.922 --> 00:50:14.315
I'll catch up
with you ladies later.

1122
00:50:18.537 --> 00:50:21.366
They took our phones
when we got here. I told you.

1123
00:50:21.453 --> 00:50:24.021
But you said you'd call
from the community phone.

1124
00:50:24.108 --> 00:50:26.153
- I did.
- Yeah. Once.

1125
00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:28.068
I got busy. I'm sorry.

1126
00:50:28.155 --> 00:50:29.722
Uh. did you get busy.

1127
00:50:29.809 --> 00:50:32.594
or were you busy
getting bullied by...

1128
00:50:32.681 --> 00:50:34.988
I don't really want
to talk about this here.

1129
00:50:35.075 --> 00:50:36.859
Okay. How about we
talk about it in the car.

1130
00:50:36.946 --> 00:50:38.557
on the way home?

1131
00:50:38.644 --> 00:50:41.647
Hey. you guys.
go on to breakfast without me.

1132
00:50:41.734 --> 00:50:43.997
- I'll catch up with you.
- Oh. You sure. huh?

1133
00:50:44.084 --> 00:50:45.216
You sure?
Yes.

1134
00:50:45.303 --> 00:50:46.652
Yeah. Okay.

1135
00:51:35.353 --> 00:51:36.658
Where are your bags?

1136
00:51:36.745 --> 00:51:39.661
Um. you're welcome
to stay if you'd like.

1137
00:51:39.748 --> 00:51:42.142
but camp ends on Sunday.

1138
00:51:42.229 --> 00:51:44.362
and I'll go home then.

1139
00:51:44.449 --> 00:51:46.320
I never agreed to you
flitting off

1140
00:51:46.407 --> 00:51:48.322
and disappearing
for a week.

1141
00:51:48.409 --> 00:51:50.498
In 45 years.
have you ever known me

1142
00:51:50.585 --> 00:51:52.544
to flit anywhere?

1143
00:51:52.631 --> 00:51:54.198
I don't know.

1144
00:51:54.285 --> 00:51:56.330
You know.
none of this is you.

1145
00:51:56.417 --> 00:51:57.810
The Mary I know

1146
00:51:57.897 --> 00:51:59.725
would've been checking in
every morning.

1147
00:51:59.812 --> 00:52:01.379
She would've wanted to know

1148
00:52:01.466 --> 00:52:03.163
if I made it
to Andrew's swim meet

1149
00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:04.469
and whether we had
gone out to the Longhorn.

1150
00:52:04.556 --> 00:52:06.166
She wouldn't have
just disappeared!

1151
00:52:06.253 --> 00:52:10.518
The Mary you know hasn't been
happy for 20 years. Mike.

1152
00:52:10.605 --> 00:52:12.564
I'm finally having fun.

1153
00:52:12.651 --> 00:52:14.131
Well. that's news to me.

1154
00:52:14.218 --> 00:52:16.307
I'm sure it is.

1155
00:52:16.394 --> 00:52:18.352
You don't notice anything

1156
00:52:18.439 --> 00:52:20.920
until it directly
affects you.

1157
00:52:21.007 --> 00:52:24.097
I allowed my needs.
what I wanted

1158
00:52:24.184 --> 00:52:26.143
to take a backseat to you

1159
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:29.798
and to John. Andrew.
to people in distress.

1160
00:52:29.885 --> 00:52:33.846
- Oh. okay. It's about work.
- No. I like my work.

1161
00:52:33.933 --> 00:52:35.587
I told you
you didn't have to work.

1162
00:52:35.674 --> 00:52:38.372
How many times have I said
that I would support you?

1163
00:52:38.459 --> 00:52:39.547
Are you getting any info?

1164
00:52:39.634 --> 00:52:41.070
- Shut up.
- Oh. shut up. okay?

1165
00:52:41.158 --> 00:52:43.464
- You shut up.
- You shut up.

1166
00:52:43.551 --> 00:52:45.118
- Shut up.
- I am shut up.

1167
00:52:45.205 --> 00:52:49.253
Financially. yes.
Emotionally. no.

1168
00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:51.472
- Good for her. man.
- Good for her!

1169
00:52:51.559 --> 00:52:53.692
What you're talking about
is not support.

1170
00:52:53.779 --> 00:52:54.823
It's ownership.

1171
00:52:54.910 --> 00:52:56.303
Ownership?!

1172
00:52:57.783 --> 00:52:59.393
Okay. um...

1173
00:53:01.656 --> 00:53:04.093
I let you come here.

1174
00:53:04.181 --> 00:53:06.008
But now it's time
to go home.

1175
00:53:09.273 --> 00:53:10.317
No.

1176
00:53:12.014 --> 00:53:16.149
I don't know what you want.

1177
00:53:16.236 --> 00:53:20.414
I want you
to care about me.

1178
00:53:20.501 --> 00:53:23.765
Care about the things
I care about.

1179
00:53:27.378 --> 00:53:29.075
Right now...

1180
00:53:29.162 --> 00:53:31.208
I want to stay here
with my friends.

1181
00:53:34.994 --> 00:53:36.125
Yeah. I'll...

1182
00:53:37.866 --> 00:53:40.565
I'll be back
to pick you up on Sunday.

1183
00:53:40.652 --> 00:53:43.132
Why does everything
he says sound like a threat?

1184
00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:44.438
Who does he think he is?

1185
00:53:44.525 --> 00:53:46.005
- I don't know.
- I never liked him.

1186
00:53:46.092 --> 00:53:48.399
- No. no. no.
- He's cute though.

1187
00:53:48.486 --> 00:53:50.357
- I'm sorry. I didn't say that.
- You think everybody's cute.

1188
00:53:50.444 --> 00:53:51.489
I do not.

1189
00:53:54.492 --> 00:53:55.536
Drive safe!

1190
00:53:56.624 --> 00:53:58.539
Good riddance!

1191
00:53:58.626 --> 00:54:00.672
Hope you can take your eyes
off your ego

1192
00:54:00.759 --> 00:54:04.371
long enough
to keep 'em on the road!

1193
00:54:04.458 --> 00:54:05.894
Oh! "Eyes off your ego."

1194
00:54:05.981 --> 00:54:07.374
I should write that down.

1195
00:54:09.158 --> 00:54:11.465
- Mare.
- Little lamb.

1196
00:54:11.552 --> 00:54:14.468
How much of that
did you hear?

1197
00:54:14.555 --> 00:54:15.991
Basically all of it.

1198
00:54:16.078 --> 00:54:18.255
But are you okay?

1199
00:54:18.342 --> 00:54:23.260
I-- I just feel so...
relieved!

1200
00:54:24.652 --> 00:54:26.088
Like a got a 100-pound weight

1201
00:54:26.175 --> 00:54:27.742
off my shoulders!

1202
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:30.049
I know
it's not a big deal.

1203
00:54:30.136 --> 00:54:33.531
but I feel like I got
some kind of a super power.

1204
00:54:33.618 --> 00:54:36.185
That's the power of no.

1205
00:54:36.273 --> 00:54:37.578
Feels good. right?

1206
00:54:38.884 --> 00:54:40.233
Yeah.

1207
00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:42.453
Well. I think.
I mean in honor

1208
00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:45.804
of this momentous occasion.

1209
00:54:45.891 --> 00:54:47.849
Mary gets to choose
our next activity.

1210
00:54:47.936 --> 00:54:49.329
Yes!

1211
00:54:49.416 --> 00:54:52.419
Do you still
want to do the pottery?

1212
00:55:04.562 --> 00:55:07.434
Hey. Mare. You sure
you're up for this?

1213
00:55:07.521 --> 00:55:10.002
- You smell that?
- Oh. yeah.

1214
00:55:10.089 --> 00:55:12.352
This is pure affection.

1215
00:55:12.439 --> 00:55:14.876
Ladies! You ready
to tear up some turf?

1216
00:55:14.963 --> 00:55:17.401
Yeah. So archery didn't
work out either. eh?

1217
00:55:17.488 --> 00:55:19.316
I'm still exploring.
Finding my strengths.

1218
00:55:19.403 --> 00:55:21.100
You're never too old
to try something new. right?

1219
00:55:21.187 --> 00:55:23.624
Like probation. which.
incidentally. I am now on.

1220
00:55:23.711 --> 00:55:25.496
Oh.

1221
00:55:26.584 --> 00:55:28.063
Oh! Oh!

1222
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:30.109
Oh! Oh. oh...

1223
00:55:30.196 --> 00:55:32.154
Come on. Up!

1224
00:55:32.241 --> 00:55:34.374
Oh. God!

1225
00:55:36.333 --> 00:55:40.598
Sorry.
Such a powerful beast. Whoo!

1226
00:55:40.685 --> 00:55:44.428
I think. uh. maybe
it's better I just observe.

1227
00:55:44.515 --> 00:55:46.343
Whoo-hoo!

1228
00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:49.084
- My God!
- She's still got it!

1229
00:55:49.171 --> 00:55:50.825
She sure does.

1230
00:55:50.912 --> 00:55:53.262
I had no idea she was
such an adrenaline junkie.

1231
00:55:54.525 --> 00:55:55.656
Wow.

1232
00:55:55.743 --> 00:55:58.006
- You gonna ride?
- Well. I would.

1233
00:55:58.093 --> 00:56:01.053
but I forgot
my chaps at home.

1234
00:56:04.448 --> 00:56:08.408
Hey. guys!
Watch this! Whoo!

1235
00:56:08.495 --> 00:56:10.454
I'm not sure
that's a good idea.

1236
00:56:10.541 --> 00:56:12.020
Should she be going
that fast?

1237
00:56:13.544 --> 00:56:15.241
Jimmy!
- My boss is gonna kill me!

1238
00:56:15.328 --> 00:56:16.851
- Whoa. whoa. whoa!
- Oh!

1239
00:56:18.462 --> 00:56:19.811
Whoa. whoa. whoa!

1240
00:56:19.898 --> 00:56:21.378
Ai-ai-ai!

1241
00:56:21.465 --> 00:56:23.771
Oh! Mary!

1242
00:56:23.858 --> 00:56:25.599
Why did you jump
in front of me?

1243
00:56:25.686 --> 00:56:26.861
Are you okay?

1244
00:56:26.948 --> 00:56:29.473
- Jimmy! Aah!
- Sorry. Sorry.

1245
00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:31.257
Here. Here you go.

1246
00:56:31.344 --> 00:56:32.867
- Okay.
- I'm okay!

1247
00:56:32.954 --> 00:56:34.347
Mare. you good?

1248
00:56:34.434 --> 00:56:35.827
- Yes!
- I'll get the horse.

1249
00:56:35.914 --> 00:56:38.220
Would you like some help up?

1250
00:56:38.307 --> 00:56:39.265
I got it.

1251
00:56:42.790 --> 00:56:44.662
You got a little schmutz...

1252
00:56:44.749 --> 00:56:46.403
- like everywhere.
- Where? Where is it?

1253
00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:49.406
Well. since
we've worked up an appetite.

1254
00:56:49.493 --> 00:56:53.627
um. you care to join us
for dinner tonight?

1255
00:56:53.714 --> 00:56:55.455
Oh. well. I mean.
that'd be great.

1256
00:56:55.542 --> 00:56:56.848
but I'm not sure
Mare's up to...

1257
00:56:56.935 --> 00:56:58.806
We'd love to!

1258
00:56:58.893 --> 00:56:59.807
- Good.
- Oh. God.

1259
00:56:59.894 --> 00:57:01.200
Good.
Then it's a date!

1260
00:57:01.287 --> 00:57:02.375
Bravo.

1261
00:57:04.246 --> 00:57:05.987
Wait... Wait a minute.

1262
00:57:06.074 --> 00:57:07.902
Did he just say...?

1263
00:57:11.993 --> 00:57:14.082
Well. the food
hasn't changed.

1264
00:57:14.169 --> 00:57:15.910
No. it hasn't.

1265
00:57:15.997 --> 00:57:17.346
Davidson. I hear

1266
00:57:17.434 --> 00:57:19.392
your son's doing big things
in the city.

1267
00:57:19.479 --> 00:57:22.134
Jamie? Yeah. well. smart kid.

1268
00:57:22.221 --> 00:57:23.614
Good business sense.

1269
00:57:23.701 --> 00:57:25.267
Although that whole
crypto thing

1270
00:57:25.354 --> 00:57:27.966
still makes my head spin.

1271
00:57:28.053 --> 00:57:30.664
Make way. boys.

1272
00:57:30.751 --> 00:57:32.144
- Ladies.
- Wow.

1273
00:57:32.231 --> 00:57:34.233
We were starting to think
you were standing us up!

1274
00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:36.931
Nora. there's a seat... Oh. thank you.

1275
00:57:37.018 --> 00:57:38.759
...if you wanna take that.
You know what?

1276
00:57:38.846 --> 00:57:40.369
Why don't we look
for another table?

1277
00:57:40.457 --> 00:57:42.763
No. You two.
you're off the team.

1278
00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:44.809
- Oh. Ginny!
- What?

1279
00:57:44.896 --> 00:57:46.593
It's okay.
They were one drink away

1280
00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:48.116
from passing out anyway.

1281
00:57:48.203 --> 00:57:50.162
Ginny. congrats

1282
00:57:50.249 --> 00:57:51.772
on an amazing career.

1283
00:57:51.859 --> 00:57:54.732
I hear you're quite
the self-help guru now.

1284
00:57:54.819 --> 00:57:56.951
Aah! Ugh! Stevie D.

1285
00:57:57.038 --> 00:58:00.128
it's frowned upon to refer
to ourselves as gurus.

1286
00:58:00.215 --> 00:58:01.390
We're not a cult.

1287
00:58:01.478 --> 00:58:03.131
Well. maybe you can
give me some tips.

1288
00:58:03.218 --> 00:58:04.611
Uh. no. I'm sorry. You know.

1289
00:58:04.698 --> 00:58:06.439
after my third bestseller.
I just...

1290
00:58:06.526 --> 00:58:08.093
I don't do one-on-one's
anymore.

1291
00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:11.488
We're going global. Basically.
I'm the next Dr. Phil.

1292
00:58:11.575 --> 00:58:12.837
But not a doctor.

1293
00:58:12.924 --> 00:58:14.578
Uh. Brené Brown.

1294
00:58:14.665 --> 00:58:16.405
Again. not a doctor.

1295
00:58:16.493 --> 00:58:18.016
You either. Mary.

1296
00:58:18.103 --> 00:58:19.844
I can get an honorary PhD

1297
00:58:19.931 --> 00:58:22.411
just by picking up the phone.

1298
00:58:22.499 --> 00:58:24.283
- Tommy?
- Tommy? You okay?

1299
00:58:24.370 --> 00:58:26.024
Here.

1300
00:58:26.111 --> 00:58:28.417
Probably just a chicken wing
down the old windpipe.

1301
00:58:28.505 --> 00:58:30.898
It'll work its way out.
Do you want some of my Scotch?

1302
00:58:30.985 --> 00:58:33.335
Oh! Okay.

1303
00:58:36.469 --> 00:58:37.514
- What a launch!
- Uh-oh.

1304
00:58:41.213 --> 00:58:43.520
He had a chicken bone
caught in his throat.

1305
00:58:43.607 --> 00:58:46.174
We were doing the Heimlich.
That's why it...

1306
00:58:46.261 --> 00:58:48.960
Hey. man. I was choking.
It wasn't meant for you.

1307
00:58:50.614 --> 00:58:53.921
What the...?
I see where this is going.

1308
00:58:54.008 --> 00:58:56.054
Food fight!

1309
00:58:58.143 --> 00:58:59.448
Let's go!

1310
00:59:02.016 --> 00:59:03.844
Unless you want to be
in a Stooges' movie.

1311
00:59:03.931 --> 00:59:05.150
let's get out of here!

1312
00:59:07.718 --> 00:59:09.110
Down. baby. down!

1313
00:59:10.503 --> 00:59:12.157
Here! Here! Here!

1314
00:59:12.244 --> 00:59:15.247
Get control! You've gotta
stop this from happening!

1315
00:59:18.250 --> 00:59:20.252
<i>♪ It was like lightning ♪</i>

1316
00:59:20.339 --> 00:59:22.602
<i>♪ Everybody was frightening ♪</i>

1317
00:59:22.689 --> 00:59:25.083
<i>♪ And the music

1318
00:59:25.170 --> 00:59:27.433
We've got a 10-34 in progress!

1319
00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:29.391
Hot dog and
baked potato bombs.

1320
00:59:29.478 --> 00:59:32.133
weenie grenades. Whoa!

1321
00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:34.179

1323
00:59:36.311 --> 00:59:39.010
Ms. Moon is compromised!
I'm going in!

1324
00:59:45.538 --> 00:59:49.324
Officer down!
Officer down!

1325
00:59:53.285 --> 00:59:55.113
That's the reason... NORA: Yes?

1326
00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:56.854
...I was hesitant to come

1327
00:59:56.941 --> 00:59:58.159
to this damn thing
in the first place.

1328
00:59:58.246 --> 00:59:59.639
Where's the door?

1329
00:59:59.726 --> 01:00:01.162
You know. this is not

1330
01:00:01.249 --> 01:00:02.903
how I hoped
dinner would go tonight.

1331
01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:04.426
I'm still hungry.

1332
01:00:06.341 --> 01:00:08.126
Well... Yeah. and--

1333
01:00:08.213 --> 01:00:09.518
This is a kitchen.

1334
01:00:11.216 --> 01:00:13.740
So. what's for dinner. chef?

1335
01:00:15.307 --> 01:00:17.004
- Oh. no. no. no.
- No?

1336
01:00:17.091 --> 01:00:18.919
The only thing I know
how to make is...

1337
01:00:19.006 --> 01:00:20.486
Is?
A reservation.

1338
01:00:20.573 --> 01:00:21.530
Yeah.

1339
01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:22.749
Right.

1340
01:00:22.836 --> 01:00:26.274
But. under
the circumstances. um...

1341
01:00:27.449 --> 01:00:28.929
I think I might be able

1342
01:00:29.016 --> 01:00:30.583
- to come up with something.
- Oh!

1343
01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:32.411
What do we have?

1344
01:00:32.498 --> 01:00:35.066
Cream cheese and lox.

1345
01:00:35.153 --> 01:00:37.808
I am a bad bitch.

1346
01:00:37.895 --> 01:00:39.592
Come again?

1347
01:00:39.679 --> 01:00:41.420
I was just talking
to myself. It's nothing.

1348
01:00:41.507 --> 01:00:42.987
I do that a lot. and...

1349
01:00:43.074 --> 01:00:46.207
Interesting conversation.

1350
01:00:46.294 --> 01:00:49.123
Okay. Here we go.

1351
01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:51.125
Now the magic happens.

1352
01:00:51.212 --> 01:00:54.041
You know. I've been
forcing myself...

1353
01:00:55.739 --> 01:00:58.611
- to go with the flow more.
- Oh. uh-huh.

1354
01:00:58.698 --> 01:01:00.308
You know. this is...

1355
01:01:00.395 --> 01:01:04.269
Well. you know. I mean.
practice makes perfect.

1356
01:01:04.356 --> 01:01:08.752
Yeah. Or you realize
there is no perfect.

1357
01:01:10.754 --> 01:01:13.931
- Oh!
- Uh-uh. Not yet.

1358
01:01:22.113 --> 01:01:24.419
Oh! Ooh...

1359
01:01:24.506 --> 01:01:26.813
I mean. what just...
What just happened?

1360
01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:30.382
I think you just
initiated something.

1361
01:01:30.469 --> 01:01:31.688
You leaned in.

1362
01:01:31.775 --> 01:01:33.385
I leaned in

1363
01:01:33.472 --> 01:01:36.518
to grab
the pepper grinder.

1364
01:01:36.605 --> 01:01:37.824
Oh.

1365
01:01:37.911 --> 01:01:39.739
Nora.
What?

1366
01:01:39.826 --> 01:01:42.916
I think it's great
that you made the first move.

1367
01:01:43.003 --> 01:01:45.440
I didn't! You do?

1368
01:01:45.527 --> 01:01:49.096
- Yeah.
- I'm a bad bitch.

1369
01:01:49.183 --> 01:01:51.316
Uh. I wouldn't say that.

1370
01:01:51.403 --> 01:01:53.753
No. no. no. no.
Of course you wouldn't.

1371
01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.016
But anyway. thank you
for inviting us...

1372
01:01:56.103 --> 01:01:58.279
or me tonight or whatever.

1373
01:01:58.366 --> 01:01:59.716
I had fun. I had fun.

1374
01:01:59.803 --> 01:02:00.804
- Yeah? Me too.
- Yeah.

1375
01:02:00.891 --> 01:02:03.023
I could walk you home.

1376
01:02:03.110 --> 01:02:05.591
I think I'm going to go
and catch up with the girls.

1377
01:02:05.678 --> 01:02:08.507
Well then.
I guess I'll just go.

1378
01:02:08.594 --> 01:02:10.857
- Okay.
- Yeah. okay. That's fine.

1379
01:02:10.944 --> 01:02:12.816
So we'll. uh...

1380
01:02:12.903 --> 01:02:14.165
So we'll......see you. then.

1381
01:02:14.252 --> 01:02:16.297
Sure. Yeah.

1382
01:02:16.384 --> 01:02:18.822
That's great.
That's great. Sure.

1383
01:02:18.909 --> 01:02:22.608
Oh. my God. Oh. my God!
I can't...

1384
01:02:22.695 --> 01:02:24.871
Oh! Oh. sorry!

1385
01:02:24.958 --> 01:02:26.655
- You okay?
- I was just cleaning up.

1386
01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:28.353
You know how it goes. Yeah.

1387
01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.268
I think it'll be fine.
Good night.

1388
01:02:30.355 --> 01:02:31.356
Great seeing you.

1389
01:02:31.443 --> 01:02:32.792
- Good night.
- Good night.

1390
01:02:34.489 --> 01:02:35.664
Hey!

1391
01:02:37.579 --> 01:02:40.539
Oh. my God.
that's a heavy table.

1392
01:02:40.626 --> 01:02:41.583
Is this hickory?

1393
01:02:46.284 --> 01:02:47.720
I'm gonna throw up.

1394
01:02:54.118 --> 01:02:57.208
♪ Stevie and Nora
Sitting in a tree ♪

1395
01:02:57.295 --> 01:03:01.038
♪ K-I-S-S-I-N-G ♪No. no! No!

1396
01:03:01.125 --> 01:03:03.562
Is that a Sun Chip?

1397
01:03:03.649 --> 01:03:05.303
Oh. no! No. no. no.

1398
01:03:05.390 --> 01:03:07.305
I know you want it.
You know you want it.

1399
01:03:07.392 --> 01:03:09.437
God. you're getting food
all over the place.

1400
01:03:09.524 --> 01:03:11.788
- What are you doing anyway?
- Get the mop. Mary.

1401
01:03:13.746 --> 01:03:14.878
Mary. get the mop.

1402
01:03:17.532 --> 01:03:18.664
You get the mop.

1403
01:03:18.751 --> 01:03:20.797
Hmm?

1404
01:03:20.884 --> 01:03:25.149
If you notice
that somebody needs to mop.

1405
01:03:25.236 --> 01:03:27.151
then you can do it

1406
01:03:27.238 --> 01:03:29.718
instead of just
pointing it out! Geez!

1407
01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:31.720
Mike does that
all the time. Aah!

1408
01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:33.461
- I'm so sick of it.
- You see?

1409
01:03:33.548 --> 01:03:36.203
- This isn't about me.
- Yeah. Actually it is.

1410
01:03:36.290 --> 01:03:39.859
All I ever get from you. Gin.
is judgment.

1411
01:03:39.946 --> 01:03:42.079
- Me?
- Yes! You!

1412
01:03:42.166 --> 01:03:45.299
Mike.
And everybody in my life!

1413
01:03:45.386 --> 01:03:46.648
Oh. boo-hoo. honey.

1414
01:03:46.735 --> 01:03:48.302
If you wanted
to make a change.

1415
01:03:48.389 --> 01:03:49.869
you would have.

1416
01:03:49.956 --> 01:03:52.089
It is not that easy.
Ginny Moon.

1417
01:03:52.176 --> 01:03:53.917
It is that easy.

1418
01:03:54.004 --> 01:03:56.528
You have to take some
ownership of your situation.

1419
01:03:56.615 --> 01:03:58.443
Clearly you like
being a doormat

1420
01:03:58.530 --> 01:04:00.619
or you would've
packed your bags

1421
01:04:00.706 --> 01:04:02.577
a long time ago.
Hey!

1422
01:04:02.664 --> 01:04:04.144
Hey. hey. wait a second.

1423
01:04:04.231 --> 01:04:06.059
There was no reason
to tear her down!

1424
01:04:06.146 --> 01:04:07.452
Tear her down?

1425
01:04:07.539 --> 01:04:09.671
That's all I've been
hearing for 20 years.

1426
01:04:09.758 --> 01:04:12.109
- Get your shit together. Mary!
- No. no. Enough!

1427
01:04:12.196 --> 01:04:14.024
You know. that may be
your mantra. okay?

1428
01:04:14.111 --> 01:04:15.852
But it's not fair
to force it on...

1429
01:04:15.939 --> 01:04:17.375
- Oh. here we go.
- What?

1430
01:04:17.462 --> 01:04:19.203
It's squeaky-clean Nora.

1431
01:04:19.290 --> 01:04:20.726
Scrubbing up
all our problems.

1432
01:04:20.813 --> 01:04:22.293
shoving them
under the rug.

1433
01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:24.121
covering them up with
work-work-work.

1434
01:04:24.208 --> 01:04:25.905
You know. if you stay
busy enough.

1435
01:04:25.992 --> 01:04:27.559
maybe you'll never
have to confront...

1436
01:04:27.646 --> 01:04:29.300
Okay!
You tell me who else

1437
01:04:29.387 --> 01:04:30.736
is going to pay my bills?!
Huh?

1438
01:04:30.823 --> 01:04:32.390
Nora. you got
plenty of money.

1439
01:04:32.477 --> 01:04:34.305
And maybe you could
have someone

1440
01:04:34.392 --> 01:04:36.176
if you weren't
so addicted to the grind.

1441
01:04:36.263 --> 01:04:37.874
You're on autopilot. baby!

1442
01:04:37.961 --> 01:04:39.701
Oh. thank you. babe.
Thank you.

1443
01:04:39.788 --> 01:04:41.529
Thank you
for your armchair analysis.

1444
01:04:41.616 --> 01:04:42.879
And I feel so much better.

1445
01:04:42.966 --> 01:04:44.532
I'm not gonna
engage with you on this

1446
01:04:44.619 --> 01:04:46.578
because you're not coming
from your authentic self.

1447
01:04:46.665 --> 01:04:48.145
What? Oh. yeah?

1448
01:04:48.232 --> 01:04:51.061
That's really ironic
coming from Ginny Moon

1449
01:04:51.148 --> 01:04:53.802
aka Jennifer Moskowitz.

1450
01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:55.021
What?

1451
01:04:56.327 --> 01:04:58.677
Oh. what?! No! Oh. okay.

1452
01:04:58.764 --> 01:05:01.898
- That's it for you. Oh!
- Oh! Ow!

1453
01:05:01.985 --> 01:05:03.725
Oh. yeah.
Like that hurt. huh?

1454
01:05:03.812 --> 01:05:04.944
- Huh?
- Huh?

1455
01:05:05.031 --> 01:05:06.032
Huh?

1456
01:05:06.119 --> 01:05:07.164
Oh! Oh. dear!

1457
01:05:07.251 --> 01:05:08.687
Oh. my God! Your face!

1458
01:05:08.774 --> 01:05:10.863
Nora!
What? Oh!

1459
01:05:12.691 --> 01:05:14.084
Is that your cell phone?

1460
01:05:14.171 --> 01:05:17.957
Have you had your phone
on you this entire time?!

1461
01:05:18.044 --> 01:05:19.524
No!

1462
01:05:19.611 --> 01:05:22.570
Oh. okay. I-- Aah!

1463
01:05:22.657 --> 01:05:24.311
Don't lie to us!

1464
01:05:24.398 --> 01:05:26.052
What's the big deal?
I wasn't even using it.

1465
01:05:26.139 --> 01:05:27.749
Big deal is that
I needed a phone

1466
01:05:27.836 --> 01:05:29.186
to check in on my family.

1467
01:05:29.273 --> 01:05:31.492
Nora needed a phone
to check in at work.

1468
01:05:31.579 --> 01:05:33.538
and you were hiding one!

1469
01:05:33.625 --> 01:05:36.236
But the rules don't apply
to you. do they. Ginny?

1470
01:05:36.323 --> 01:05:38.891
Do you even care about us?

1471
01:05:38.978 --> 01:05:40.762
- No. no. no. No!
- Oh!

1472
01:05:40.849 --> 01:05:43.287
- Stop.
- Of course I care about you!

1473
01:05:43.374 --> 01:05:45.854
You think I would've
done all this

1474
01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:48.422
just to get you two
to gang up on me?

1475
01:05:48.509 --> 01:05:50.250
I spent a quarter
of a million dollars

1476
01:05:50.337 --> 01:05:52.209
setting this whole thing up.

1477
01:05:52.296 --> 01:05:53.906
This whole reunion
was you?

1478
01:05:57.127 --> 01:06:00.260
Was this all some big scheme

1479
01:06:00.347 --> 01:06:02.567
to just... to fix us?

1480
01:06:02.654 --> 01:06:04.786
It was the only way
I could get the two of you

1481
01:06:04.873 --> 01:06:06.136
to spend time with me.

1482
01:06:06.223 --> 01:06:08.529
- You're a psychopath.
- No. no-- Oh!

1483
01:06:08.616 --> 01:06:11.489
- At least I'm on a path. babe.
- No. no--!

1484
01:06:11.576 --> 01:06:13.099
To destruction!

1485
01:06:13.186 --> 01:06:14.666
You may not like my methods.

1486
01:06:14.753 --> 01:06:16.233
but I'm helping people!

1487
01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:18.931
Well. maybe people
don't want to be helped!

1488
01:06:19.018 --> 01:06:21.412
Okay. that's it.
I'm leaving. Oh!

1489
01:06:21.499 --> 01:06:23.240
Not if I leave first!

1490
01:06:23.327 --> 01:06:25.894
Oh. fuck you. pillow.

1491
01:06:25.982 --> 01:06:28.245
Okay. If you're gonna go.
just go!

1492
01:06:29.550 --> 01:06:31.596
Take a hike!

1493
01:06:45.044 --> 01:06:46.437
No.

1494
01:06:51.572 --> 01:06:53.661
Oh. Gotcha.

1495
01:07:00.407 --> 01:07:01.800
Oh...

1496
01:07:05.151 --> 01:07:08.415
<i>Alarm engaged.
Sound in three. two. one...</i>

1497
01:07:08.502 --> 01:07:09.764
Oh. my God!

1498
01:07:09.851 --> 01:07:11.331
Wait a minute! Hold the phone!

1499
01:07:11.418 --> 01:07:12.985
It's 2-5-2-5.

1500
01:07:16.249 --> 01:07:18.817
Oh. my God. My goodness.

1501
01:07:18.904 --> 01:07:21.037
<i>Hello. Ginny Moon.</i>

1502
01:07:21.124 --> 01:07:24.823
Oh. I'll just log in as myself.

1503
01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:26.216
There you go.

1504
01:07:26.303 --> 01:07:30.524
Call Kris Thompson-Grey.

1505
01:07:30.611 --> 01:07:33.353
<i>Did you say
call Christ Church Alliance?</i>

1506
01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:35.268
No. no! No. no. no. no.
Call Kris--

1507
01:07:35.355 --> 01:07:37.879
Aah! Thompson-Grey!

1508
01:07:37.966 --> 01:07:39.751
No. no. no. no.
<i>Calling Christ Church Alliance.</i>

1509
01:07:39.838 --> 01:07:41.579
Hang up! Oh. shoot. Oh. God!

1510
01:07:41.666 --> 01:07:43.581
<i>Hello. you've reached...</i>

1511
01:07:43.668 --> 01:07:46.323
Goddamn it. you piece of shit!
<i>- Christ Church Alliance.</i>

1512
01:07:46.410 --> 01:07:48.977
Okay.

1513
01:07:52.503 --> 01:07:55.375
<i>You have 244 unread messages.</i>

1514
01:07:57.725 --> 01:07:58.813
Okay. Calm down.

1515
01:08:13.176 --> 01:08:14.829
Aah! Oh! Oh...

1516
01:08:14.916 --> 01:08:16.396
Nora? Is that you?

1517
01:08:16.483 --> 01:08:18.529
Good morning.

1518
01:08:18.616 --> 01:08:20.792
What are you doing
sleeping in this thing?

1519
01:08:20.879 --> 01:08:23.534
I just dozed off.
It's nothing. you know.

1520
01:08:23.621 --> 01:08:25.666
- I'm fine.
- Can I come in?

1521
01:08:25.753 --> 01:08:26.972
Well. yes.

1522
01:08:30.236 --> 01:08:32.020
Wow!
Yeah.

1523
01:08:33.674 --> 01:08:35.111
Very cool.

1524
01:08:35.198 --> 01:08:37.678
Yep.

1525
01:08:37.765 --> 01:08:40.986
Yeah. Must be nice
to have famous friends. huh?

1526
01:08:41.073 --> 01:08:42.509
- Of course.
- Is that. uh...

1527
01:08:42.596 --> 01:08:44.729
- What? Huh?
- Is that barbecue sauce?

1528
01:08:44.816 --> 01:08:46.861
Huh?

1529
01:08:46.948 --> 01:08:48.733
Ugh.

1530
01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:52.040
Nora. Have you been
working all night?

1531
01:08:52.128 --> 01:08:53.520
No. no. no. No.

1532
01:08:53.607 --> 01:08:55.870
What?

1533
01:08:55.957 --> 01:08:57.524
- No.
- No. really. just tell me.

1534
01:08:57.611 --> 01:08:59.439
Go ahead. You can say it.
I see your face.

1535
01:08:59.526 --> 01:09:01.572
- Yeah. Yeah. I know.
- Well. what is it?

1536
01:09:01.659 --> 01:09:03.487
- It's nothing.
- Is it pity or disappointment?

1537
01:09:03.574 --> 01:09:06.620
It's not-- I could never
be disappointed in you.

1538
01:09:06.707 --> 01:09:07.926
It's... What?

1539
01:09:08.013 --> 01:09:10.058
It's recognition. Okay?

1540
01:09:10.146 --> 01:09:12.626
I was this close to being
in your same place.

1541
01:09:12.713 --> 01:09:16.152
But you're further gone
than I was.

1542
01:09:16.239 --> 01:09:18.893
Well. always an overachiever.

1543
01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:20.939
If I'm gonna be a workaholic.

1544
01:09:21.026 --> 01:09:22.462
then I'm gonna be
the best one there is!

1545
01:09:22.549 --> 01:09:26.031
It's a drug. It's a hard
habit to kick. believe me.

1546
01:09:26.118 --> 01:09:29.643
When you're addicted
to your work...

1547
01:09:29.730 --> 01:09:32.385
rock bottom feels like...

1548
01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:35.301
winning.

1549
01:09:35.388 --> 01:09:37.303
Huh?

1550
01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:39.392
Oh. Oh. God.

1551
01:09:39.479 --> 01:09:40.959
It's. uh... Oh.

1552
01:09:41.046 --> 01:09:42.656
You know what? I'll. uh...

1553
01:09:42.743 --> 01:09:44.310
- I'll leave you to it.
- Oh.

1554
01:09:44.397 --> 01:09:49.010
Oh. okay. Fine. Bye.

1555
01:10:00.152 --> 01:10:01.545
You know what?

1556
01:10:03.895 --> 01:10:05.331
Ah. shit.

1557
01:10:07.115 --> 01:10:08.552
Um...

1558
01:10:08.639 --> 01:10:09.553
Hey!

1559
01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:11.424
Hey.

1560
01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:15.515
Just...

1561
01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:31.575
I thought you were a bear.

1562
01:10:31.662 --> 01:10:32.793
I wish.

1563
01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:34.708
You do?

1564
01:10:34.795 --> 01:10:36.884
No. I was gonna
think of something

1565
01:10:36.971 --> 01:10:39.147
charming to say.
and then you startled me

1566
01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:41.367
when you screamed.

1567
01:10:46.764 --> 01:10:48.853
Oh. wait. Were you having
a contemplative moment?

1568
01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:50.376
I'm sorry
if I disturbed you.

1569
01:10:50.463 --> 01:10:53.814
No. you didn't. Come on.
I'd like the company. Sit.

1570
01:10:55.425 --> 01:10:56.687
Coffee?

1571
01:10:56.774 --> 01:10:57.905
Yes. please.

1572
01:10:57.992 --> 01:11:00.299
I never do things like this.

1573
01:11:00.386 --> 01:11:02.432
What? Take a walk in the woods?

1574
01:11:02.519 --> 01:11:05.043
I mean.
just putting myself first.

1575
01:11:05.130 --> 01:11:07.306
You know. I raised my kids.

1576
01:11:07.393 --> 01:11:09.439
Now I'm raising grandkids.

1577
01:11:09.526 --> 01:11:12.355
I take Camille
to ballet class.

1578
01:11:12.442 --> 01:11:15.619
I gotta cover
people's shift at work.

1579
01:11:15.706 --> 01:11:20.841
Help Mike find a caboose
for his vintage train set.

1580
01:11:20.928 --> 01:11:22.582
Oh. heh! Sorry.

1581
01:11:22.669 --> 01:11:25.193
I just unloaded all that.

1582
01:11:25.281 --> 01:11:26.499
Sorry.

1583
01:11:26.586 --> 01:11:28.240
No. You don't have to apologize.

1584
01:11:28.327 --> 01:11:30.590
Sorry. Oh. I...

1585
01:11:30.677 --> 01:11:33.419
...said it again. All right.

1586
01:11:33.506 --> 01:11:35.595
Okay. You know.
not to overstep.

1587
01:11:35.682 --> 01:11:37.728
Mary. I think you're
a whole lot more capable

1588
01:11:37.815 --> 01:11:40.470
than you give yourself
credit for.

1589
01:11:40.557 --> 01:11:42.646
I think so too.

1590
01:11:42.733 --> 01:11:47.955
I mean. there's so many things
that I have always wanted.

1591
01:11:48.042 --> 01:11:52.656
I had beautiful children.
I've got a lovely home.

1592
01:11:52.743 --> 01:11:56.703
Everybody's healthy.
Who am I to want more?

1593
01:11:58.749 --> 01:12:00.707
But I do. Tommy.

1594
01:12:00.794 --> 01:12:02.883
I could've been a doctor.

1595
01:12:02.970 --> 01:12:04.929
I <i>should</i> have been
a doctor.

1596
01:12:05.016 --> 01:12:08.585
I was at the top
of my med school class.

1597
01:12:08.672 --> 01:12:09.716
Then I got pregnant.

1598
01:12:09.803 --> 01:12:11.414
Oh. God.

1599
01:12:11.501 --> 01:12:14.417
Oh! I can't believe
I said all that out loud.

1600
01:12:14.504 --> 01:12:16.854
- It's okay.
- Oh. no. I'm sorry.

1601
01:12:16.941 --> 01:12:20.379
I just-- I hijacked
the whole conversation.

1602
01:12:20.466 --> 01:12:23.208
making it about me.

1603
01:12:23.295 --> 01:12:27.168
But it's nice
just to be able to speak.

1604
01:12:27.255 --> 01:12:31.390
I am so. so tired
of shutting up.

1605
01:12:31.477 --> 01:12:33.479
Can you say something now?

1606
01:12:33.566 --> 01:12:36.613
No. I'm just here to hear.

1607
01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:38.571
I enjoy listening to you.

1608
01:12:40.007 --> 01:12:43.707
That is an underrated skillset.

1609
01:12:43.794 --> 01:12:49.060
Hey. um. do you think
we could do this again sometime?

1610
01:12:50.714 --> 01:12:52.411
I promise I will...

1611
01:12:52.498 --> 01:12:54.892
I'll let you get a word in
every now and then.

1612
01:12:54.979 --> 01:12:56.328
You sure about that?

1613
01:12:57.721 --> 01:12:59.940
Stop! God.

1614
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:05.119
I used to love swimming.

1615
01:13:05.206 --> 01:13:08.253
I'd wake up every morning
to do laps before work.

1616
01:13:09.733 --> 01:13:12.475
Every part of that
sounds miserable to me.

1617
01:13:12.562 --> 01:13:14.085
Okay?

1618
01:13:14.172 --> 01:13:15.608
- Okay.
- Why did you quit?

1619
01:13:15.695 --> 01:13:18.916
Oh. I let work creep in
and consume everything.

1620
01:13:19.003 --> 01:13:22.963
I set boundaries
for my life now.

1621
01:13:23.050 --> 01:13:26.576
Small step.
but seems to be working.

1622
01:13:26.663 --> 01:13:29.970
Well. no one is gonna be able
to take on what I do.

1623
01:13:30.057 --> 01:13:32.451
Well. someone
thinks highly of herself.

1624
01:13:32.538 --> 01:13:34.845
Oh. no.

1625
01:13:34.932 --> 01:13:38.544
Okay. What would happen
if you died?

1626
01:13:38.631 --> 01:13:40.546
- Oh.
- Too morbid?

1627
01:13:40.633 --> 01:13:42.592
Someone would step in...

1628
01:13:42.679 --> 01:13:44.594
Mm-hmm....and figure it out.

1629
01:13:44.681 --> 01:13:46.422
And if they didn't.
you wouldn't care.

1630
01:13:46.509 --> 01:13:48.859
- You'd be dead.
- Can we just stop talking

1631
01:13:48.946 --> 01:13:50.295
about me being dead?

1632
01:13:50.382 --> 01:13:52.123
- Yes. Okay. Sure.
- Okay.

1633
01:13:53.516 --> 01:13:54.908
One more thing
about being dead.

1634
01:13:54.995 --> 01:13:56.388
Okay. one more thing
about being...

1635
01:13:56.475 --> 01:13:57.868
- But it's about me.
- Okay. It's about you.

1636
01:13:57.955 --> 01:14:00.740
So I'm guessing that's
a better scenario for you.

1637
01:14:00.827 --> 01:14:02.829
That is arguably worse.

1638
01:14:02.916 --> 01:14:05.615
Well. I'll take that
as a compliment.

1639
01:14:05.702 --> 01:14:08.748
Sixteen years ago.
I had a heart attack.

1640
01:14:08.835 --> 01:14:10.184
- Oh.
- Big one.

1641
01:14:10.271 --> 01:14:13.274
Next morning. I wake up
in a hospital room.

1642
01:14:13.361 --> 01:14:14.798
Oh...

1643
01:14:14.885 --> 01:14:17.278
Now. if this was a movie... Yeah?

1644
01:14:17.365 --> 01:14:20.717
...and let's say
Tom Hanks was playing me.

1645
01:14:20.804 --> 01:14:23.284
he would've woken up
in that hospital room

1646
01:14:23.371 --> 01:14:25.548
- surrounded by loved ones.
- Yeah.

1647
01:14:25.635 --> 01:14:27.724
Well. it didn't happen
that way.

1648
01:14:27.811 --> 01:14:30.640
I woke up alone.

1649
01:14:30.727 --> 01:14:35.471
So. what. you just decided
to change like that?

1650
01:14:35.558 --> 01:14:36.994
The meeting I was in

1651
01:14:37.081 --> 01:14:39.213
was to discuss
selling the company.

1652
01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:42.303
- Uh-huh.
- My collapsing in the board room

1653
01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:46.960
didn't do much to.
uh. instill confidence.

1654
01:14:47.047 --> 01:14:48.527
So between the bed rest

1655
01:14:48.614 --> 01:14:50.834
and the. uh. hostile takeover.

1656
01:14:50.921 --> 01:14:52.836
I had a lot of time
to think about

1657
01:14:52.923 --> 01:14:57.101
what I had done
and not done with my life.

1658
01:14:57.188 --> 01:15:00.452
'Cause when my kids
finally did show up.

1659
01:15:00.539 --> 01:15:02.541
they weren't buying the. uh.

1660
01:15:02.628 --> 01:15:04.195
<i>It's a Wonderful Life</i> epiphany

1661
01:15:04.282 --> 01:15:06.284
their father
had just experienced.

1662
01:15:06.371 --> 01:15:09.461
Oh. But then.
so what did you do?

1663
01:15:09.548 --> 01:15:12.943
- I started showing up.
- Oh.

1664
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:14.292
It's never-ending.

1665
01:15:14.379 --> 01:15:15.815
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

1666
01:15:15.902 --> 01:15:19.384
I have to pretend
still to love golf

1667
01:15:19.471 --> 01:15:22.692
just so I can spend
four hours a week with my son.

1668
01:15:22.779 --> 01:15:24.955
But things are
a lot better now with him

1669
01:15:25.042 --> 01:15:28.132
than. uh...
Than they were.

1670
01:15:28.219 --> 01:15:33.659
Life is more than work. Nora.

1671
01:15:33.746 --> 01:15:36.270
I don't know. I don't.

1672
01:15:36.357 --> 01:15:38.751
I just feel like work
is all I have anymore.

1673
01:15:38.838 --> 01:15:41.406
- You've got your friends.
- Mm-hmm.

1674
01:15:41.493 --> 01:15:43.974
If they don't hate me
for neglecting them

1675
01:15:44.061 --> 01:15:45.279
for the last 40 years.

1676
01:15:45.366 --> 01:15:46.803
You're too lovable
to hate.

1677
01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:53.244
I was thinking. and I don't
want to be too forward.

1678
01:15:53.331 --> 01:15:56.290
It would be nice
to see you again.

1679
01:15:58.641 --> 01:16:00.294
In the real world?

1680
01:16:00.381 --> 01:16:01.382
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

1681
01:16:01.469 --> 01:16:03.515
Do you have a business card?

1682
01:16:06.213 --> 01:16:07.171
Oh!

1683
01:16:07.258 --> 01:16:09.347
Yeah!

1684
01:16:36.330 --> 01:16:37.767
Shit.

1685
01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:49.126
A wise man once said.
"that's what friends are for!"

1686
01:16:49.213 --> 01:16:50.867
But for what?

1687
01:16:50.954 --> 01:16:53.434
He didn't clarify.
He didn't...

1688
01:16:56.220 --> 01:16:59.005
Because a wise man.

1689
01:16:59.092 --> 01:17:02.182
maybe he doesn't even
have any real friends.

1690
01:17:02.269 --> 01:17:03.401
Shit.

1691
01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:07.623
Um...

1692
01:17:10.451 --> 01:17:15.979
Sometimes friends
turn their backs on you...

1693
01:17:16.066 --> 01:17:18.155
just for years!

1694
01:17:18.242 --> 01:17:19.504
I'm not naming any names.

1695
01:17:19.591 --> 01:17:21.201
Mary. Nora.

1696
01:17:26.163 --> 01:17:28.034
Are you cleaning up
deer shit?

1697
01:17:28.121 --> 01:17:31.168
Yeah. They don't trust me
to do anything else and...

1698
01:17:31.255 --> 01:17:33.649
I don't make sense in a lot
of working environments. so...

1699
01:17:33.736 --> 01:17:35.955
Yeah. Deer shit. Scat.

1700
01:17:36.042 --> 01:17:37.870
It's probably a good idea
to leave the scat.

1701
01:17:37.957 --> 01:17:39.742
It's a natural fertilizer.

1702
01:17:42.396 --> 01:17:43.789
If you were lonely.

1703
01:17:43.876 --> 01:17:45.269
why didn't you
just call your friends?

1704
01:17:45.356 --> 01:17:47.184
You didn't have to orchestrate
a reunion

1705
01:17:47.271 --> 01:17:48.664
just to give them a speech.

1706
01:17:48.751 --> 01:17:50.883
Yeah. I knew you were
eavesdropping on me.

1707
01:17:50.970 --> 01:17:52.363
You were pretty loud.

1708
01:17:53.843 --> 01:17:55.366
Okay. I see
what you're doing.

1709
01:17:55.453 --> 01:17:57.716
You're just trying to
flip this thing back on me.

1710
01:17:57.803 --> 01:18:00.153
You know. they would never
have agreed to hang with me

1711
01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:02.416
- if I just called 'em.
- How do you know?

1712
01:18:02.503 --> 01:18:04.418
Because I know.

1713
01:18:04.505 --> 01:18:06.899
- What if you're wrong?
- It's never happened.

1714
01:18:06.986 --> 01:18:10.424
Well. maybe in an effort
to keep your friends close.

1715
01:18:10.511 --> 01:18:12.296
you ended up trying
to control things

1716
01:18:12.383 --> 01:18:14.690
so you wouldn't get hurt.

1717
01:18:14.777 --> 01:18:18.215
No offense. but you're
not smart enough

1718
01:18:18.302 --> 01:18:20.260
to psychoanalyze me.

1719
01:18:26.702 --> 01:18:28.442
That hurt my feelings.

1720
01:18:37.582 --> 01:18:40.890
Um. by the way.
there's E. coli in deer scat.

1721
01:18:40.977 --> 01:18:42.848
and it's not safe
to have around kids.

1722
01:18:42.935 --> 01:18:45.503
So it does need
to get picked up.

1723
01:19:10.615 --> 01:19:14.271
Oh! God. Oh. no! Wait a second.

1724
01:19:14.358 --> 01:19:17.100
Okay. There. There.

1725
01:19:17.187 --> 01:19:18.492
Nora?

1726
01:19:18.579 --> 01:19:19.798
Oh!
Nora?

1727
01:19:19.885 --> 01:19:21.060
Oh. God. Oh. God.

1728
01:19:21.147 --> 01:19:23.062
Stop. It's just me.

1729
01:19:23.149 --> 01:19:24.977
Oh. thank goodness.
I'm so grateful.

1730
01:19:25.064 --> 01:19:26.849
So stupid.

1731
01:19:26.936 --> 01:19:28.285
Having to creep around

1732
01:19:28.372 --> 01:19:29.590
so I can shower
and get ready.

1733
01:19:29.677 --> 01:19:31.157
At least you had an out.

1734
01:19:31.244 --> 01:19:33.072
I had a full night of her
in my ear all night

1735
01:19:33.159 --> 01:19:36.032
- while I was trying to sleep.
- Did she just go on and on

1736
01:19:36.119 --> 01:19:37.511
about how awful I am?

1737
01:19:37.598 --> 01:19:39.600
Probably.
I put in earplugs.

1738
01:19:39.687 --> 01:19:40.906
I tuned her butt out.

1739
01:19:40.993 --> 01:19:44.170
I mean. this whole thing

1740
01:19:44.257 --> 01:19:46.477
is just so weird.

1741
01:19:46.564 --> 01:19:49.175
Like. who replaces
their friends' entire wardrobe?

1742
01:19:49.262 --> 01:19:51.830
She has to curate everything.

1743
01:19:51.917 --> 01:19:53.745
down to the silk neckerchief.

1744
01:19:53.832 --> 01:19:55.138
She always has.

1745
01:19:55.225 --> 01:19:56.748
Remember when she insisted

1746
01:19:56.835 --> 01:19:58.794
on throwing John
a bar mitzvah?

1747
01:19:58.881 --> 01:20:01.274
I had to drive him
to the Hebrew tutor

1748
01:20:01.361 --> 01:20:02.493
for six months straight!

1749
01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:04.669
We're Episcopalian!

1750
01:20:04.756 --> 01:20:06.453
But it was a great party. though.

1751
01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:08.151
It was a great party.

1752
01:20:08.238 --> 01:20:10.588
Yeah.
Yeah.

1753
01:20:10.675 --> 01:20:11.981
Oh...

1754
01:20:12.068 --> 01:20:14.331
You know what. this...

1755
01:20:14.418 --> 01:20:17.987
This scarf is very you.

1756
01:20:18.074 --> 01:20:20.685
Yeah. It is. isn't it?

1757
01:20:21.991 --> 01:20:23.557
Nora?
What?

1758
01:20:23.644 --> 01:20:25.342
Are we the assholes?

1759
01:20:25.429 --> 01:20:26.909
No!

1760
01:20:26.996 --> 01:20:29.041
Well. I forgot her birthday
this year!

1761
01:20:29.128 --> 01:20:31.391
Oh. I know.
I read about it in <i>People.</i>

1762
01:20:31.478 --> 01:20:33.611
then I sent her some flowers
a week late.

1763
01:20:33.698 --> 01:20:36.353
You know what?
I didn't send anything.

1764
01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:38.616
I mean. when is
her birthday? I don't know!

1765
01:20:38.703 --> 01:20:41.053
It's in January.
January 20...

1766
01:20:43.186 --> 01:20:46.058
- I feel so bad.
- Third? It's one of the 20s.

1767
01:20:46.145 --> 01:20:47.625
Maybe we are the assholes.

1768
01:20:47.712 --> 01:20:49.453
I don't know
what to make of me.

1769
01:20:49.540 --> 01:20:51.498
Oh. shit. Yeah.

1770
01:20:51.585 --> 01:20:53.674
Ooh...

1771
01:20:53.761 --> 01:20:55.372
Assholes.

1772
01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:05.121
Thank you. thank you.
Thank you so much for having me.

1773
01:21:05.208 --> 01:21:07.471
And. um. I think you
should give yourselves

1774
01:21:07.558 --> 01:21:08.951
a big round of applause

1775
01:21:09.038 --> 01:21:11.170
for making it through
seven days in bunk beds.

1776
01:21:14.043 --> 01:21:17.437
It's not as easy
60 years down the line.

1777
01:21:22.878 --> 01:21:25.750
So. um... Uh...

1778
01:21:30.233 --> 01:21:33.453
Is it just me. or is it
really warm up here?

1779
01:21:33.540 --> 01:21:34.890
What's going on?

1780
01:21:36.239 --> 01:21:38.197
It's just...
It's just me. okay.

1781
01:21:39.329 --> 01:21:40.199
Um...

1782
01:21:42.288 --> 01:21:44.421
A lot of--
A lot of us have gotten

1783
01:21:44.508 --> 01:21:46.336
settled in our ways.

1784
01:21:46.423 --> 01:21:48.251
Stuck in a rut.

1785
01:21:48.338 --> 01:21:51.080
Get your shit together!

1786
01:21:51.167 --> 01:21:54.039
I don't know if that was at me
or with me.

1787
01:21:54.126 --> 01:21:56.694
Uh. but I'm just...

1788
01:21:58.783 --> 01:22:00.916
I'm now realizing it's...

1789
01:22:01.003 --> 01:22:03.353
It's a very aggressive thing
to say to someone

1790
01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:05.224
when they may be
trying their best.

1791
01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:07.879
And that's why I loved

1792
01:22:07.966 --> 01:22:09.750
the idea of a camp reunion.

1793
01:22:09.837 --> 01:22:11.796
Aw... To get everyone

1794
01:22:11.883 --> 01:22:14.407
out of their comfort zones.

1795
01:22:16.496 --> 01:22:18.411
Which I am now. apparently.

1796
01:22:22.111 --> 01:22:23.764
And you know what?

1797
01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:29.335
It is what it is.

1798
01:22:29.422 --> 01:22:32.599
The pressure of trying
to be perfect all the time

1799
01:22:32.686 --> 01:22:34.688
and in control is just...

1800
01:22:34.775 --> 01:22:37.082
It's just infuriating!

1801
01:22:37.169 --> 01:22:38.692
Spoiler alert:

1802
01:22:38.779 --> 01:22:41.304
I don't have my shit together!

1803
01:22:41.391 --> 01:22:44.002
Sometimes--
Oftentimes.

1804
01:22:44.089 --> 01:22:46.439
it's just
out of your control.

1805
01:22:46.526 --> 01:22:48.311
And you can't...

1806
01:22:48.398 --> 01:22:50.530
You know. if you...
If you try to...

1807
01:22:50.617 --> 01:22:52.532
If you try
to hold on to things...

1808
01:22:52.619 --> 01:22:54.143
If you-- If you try...

1809
01:22:55.535 --> 01:22:57.059
If you...

1810
01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:01.324
If you try
to hold onto things.

1811
01:23:01.411 --> 01:23:02.760
they break.

1812
01:23:10.768 --> 01:23:12.988
I thought organizing
this weekend

1813
01:23:13.075 --> 01:23:15.033
would force my friends to...

1814
01:23:16.382 --> 01:23:18.645
- To see that they needed me.
- Oh...

1815
01:23:18.732 --> 01:23:20.821
To optimize their own lives.

1816
01:23:20.908 --> 01:23:23.085
But that's not what happened.

1817
01:23:25.348 --> 01:23:28.264
The most wonderful moments
we had all week

1818
01:23:28.351 --> 01:23:30.222
were just totally unexpected.

1819
01:23:31.963 --> 01:23:34.574
Because it didn't matter
what was happening

1820
01:23:34.661 --> 01:23:36.968
as long
as we were all together.

1821
01:23:39.318 --> 01:23:45.498
And I guess
that's the point of camp.

1822
01:23:45.585 --> 01:23:51.896
To reclaim that...
That childhood nonchalance.

1823
01:23:53.550 --> 01:23:56.335
Because that's when
meaningful change happens.

1824
01:23:58.598 --> 01:24:01.253
When you feel safe enough
to let your guard down.

1825
01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:03.734
So I hope all of you

1826
01:24:03.821 --> 01:24:06.563
have let your shit
hang out this week.

1827
01:24:08.043 --> 01:24:10.045
And I hope you have
many more

1828
01:24:10.132 --> 01:24:11.568
of those messy moments.

1829
01:24:11.655 --> 01:24:15.006
because it's more important
being together

1830
01:24:15.093 --> 01:24:17.139
than having your shit together.

1831
01:24:20.272 --> 01:24:21.404
Thank you.

1832
01:25:06.101 --> 01:25:07.058
Gin.

1833
01:25:11.106 --> 01:25:13.891
You didn't
have to pay for all of this

1834
01:25:13.978 --> 01:25:16.067
to get us
to hang out with you.

1835
01:25:18.548 --> 01:25:19.418
I didn't know.

1836
01:25:21.812 --> 01:25:23.074
I've just...

1837
01:25:24.597 --> 01:25:25.685
been there...

1838
01:25:27.252 --> 01:25:29.863
living vicariously
through your life events.

1839
01:25:31.952 --> 01:25:33.650
Weddings. baptisms...

1840
01:25:33.737 --> 01:25:35.130
Funerals.

1841
01:25:38.089 --> 01:25:39.438
Well. yeah.

1842
01:25:41.353 --> 01:25:43.616
But I've never
had one of my own.

1843
01:25:43.703 --> 01:25:46.315
Not a funeral. but. I mean...

1844
01:25:46.402 --> 01:25:47.881
a life event.

1845
01:25:49.796 --> 01:25:51.537
And I wanted to create one...

1846
01:25:53.539 --> 01:25:54.975
with the two of you.

1847
01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:02.113
My family.

1848
01:26:05.856 --> 01:26:08.206
But I understand
if you're both mad. so...

1849
01:26:10.556 --> 01:26:12.123
We can say goodbye now.

1850
01:26:13.646 --> 01:26:17.302
You can head out early
to the airport.

1851
01:26:17.389 --> 01:26:22.307
Well. since tomorrow
is our last day...

1852
01:26:22.394 --> 01:26:24.179
well. what would you
think about

1853
01:26:24.266 --> 01:26:28.052
maybe giving
the Sky Canopy a try?

1854
01:26:30.097 --> 01:26:31.447
Really?

1855
01:26:31.534 --> 01:26:33.188
Hell yeah!

1856
01:26:37.061 --> 01:26:38.889
Aah! Oh. no. no. Oh. God.

1857
01:26:38.976 --> 01:26:40.804
What was I thinking?

1858
01:26:40.891 --> 01:26:43.807
You'll be fine.
You're 100 feet up. tops.

1859
01:26:43.894 --> 01:26:45.765
Are you qualified
for this?

1860
01:26:45.852 --> 01:26:47.593
I got a new gig. Yeah.

1861
01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:49.726
I hired him to be
my media manager.

1862
01:26:49.813 --> 01:26:52.250
- What?
- Generating content as we expand

1863
01:26:52.337 --> 01:26:53.643
into the digital space.

1864
01:26:53.730 --> 01:26:55.210
He thinks I'm very meme-able.

1865
01:26:55.297 --> 01:26:57.386
Apparently I excel in
a more hands-off approach.

1866
01:26:57.473 --> 01:26:59.692
Oh! There you go. Oh. God!

1867
01:26:59.779 --> 01:27:01.520
Oh. please! Oh. no. no. no!

1868
01:27:01.607 --> 01:27:05.045
Nora. We'll be with you
the entire time.

1869
01:27:06.482 --> 01:27:08.614
No. stop it! Please!

1870
01:27:08.701 --> 01:27:10.964
I actually this
the squirrel cage

1871
01:27:11.051 --> 01:27:12.836
because. uh.
they used to call me

1872
01:27:12.923 --> 01:27:14.490
squirrelly in junior college.

1873
01:27:16.013 --> 01:27:18.189
I didn't graduate.

1874
01:27:18.276 --> 01:27:20.322
See? All good.

1875
01:27:20.409 --> 01:27:22.846
- Mm-hmm.
- You bring up the rear.

1876
01:27:22.933 --> 01:27:26.371
I would not recommend
looking down.

1877
01:27:26.458 --> 01:27:28.852
Hold. just quick still.
Quick still.

1878
01:27:28.939 --> 01:27:31.071
No. no. no...!Yeah!

1879
01:27:39.950 --> 01:27:42.300
This one does suck.
I'm not gonna lie.

1880
01:27:42.387 --> 01:27:43.997
It's deeply scary.

1881
01:27:47.827 --> 01:27:49.481
Whew!

1882
01:27:49.568 --> 01:27:52.571
You got this! Don't look down!

1883
01:27:52.658 --> 01:27:54.094
Okay.

1884
01:27:55.357 --> 01:27:56.619
Just keep moving!

1885
01:27:56.706 --> 01:27:58.751
I am moving! I'm moving.

1886
01:27:58.838 --> 01:28:00.666
Yes. but not forward.

1887
01:28:00.753 --> 01:28:02.320
I see what you're doing.
I do. I see it.

1888
01:28:02.407 --> 01:28:03.930
- What?
- The subtext.

1889
01:28:04.017 --> 01:28:06.890
Nora! You're literally
not moving forward!

1890
01:28:06.977 --> 01:28:08.457
I know!

1891
01:28:08.544 --> 01:28:10.937
I'm sacrificing
my friends for my job.

1892
01:28:11.024 --> 01:28:13.810
And want my friends!
I really do.

1893
01:28:13.897 --> 01:28:14.854
I want them!

1894
01:28:14.941 --> 01:28:16.291
- Hey. Nora?
- What?

1895
01:28:17.857 --> 01:28:19.468
You keep your eyes on mine.

1896
01:28:21.383 --> 01:28:22.688
You trust me?

1897
01:28:22.775 --> 01:28:24.168
No.

1898
01:28:24.255 --> 01:28:27.519
Fair enough. I deserve that.

1899
01:28:27.606 --> 01:28:30.087
I haven't been
the most trustworthy

1900
01:28:30.174 --> 01:28:31.436
or authentic friend.

1901
01:28:33.308 --> 01:28:35.440
I've been so controlling.

1902
01:28:35.527 --> 01:28:37.834
And. you know.
that I've been trying

1903
01:28:37.921 --> 01:28:39.836
to fix you and Mary.

1904
01:28:41.968 --> 01:28:44.231
Being Ginny Moon.

1905
01:28:44.319 --> 01:28:46.190
Bullying other people.

1906
01:28:46.277 --> 01:28:48.061
Changing their lives.

1907
01:28:50.412 --> 01:28:52.152
It's so much easier

1908
01:28:52.239 --> 01:28:54.198
than being
Jenny Moskowitz...

1909
01:28:54.285 --> 01:28:56.069
I understand....who really needs

1910
01:28:56.156 --> 01:28:57.941
to get her shit together.

1911
01:28:58.028 --> 01:28:59.464
- Yep.
- Oh. my God...

1912
01:28:59.551 --> 01:29:01.248
One more...

1913
01:29:02.815 --> 01:29:05.209
There you go!
There you go!

1914
01:29:05.296 --> 01:29:08.255
I'm so happy. I'm alive.

1915
01:29:08.343 --> 01:29:12.129
Oh. God!
You are the real deal.

1916
01:29:12.216 --> 01:29:14.958
That was the real deal.
do you hear me?

1917
01:29:15.045 --> 01:29:18.962
When you're vulnerable.
it's inspiring.

1918
01:29:19.049 --> 01:29:21.356
I feel like
I can do anything!

1919
01:29:21.443 --> 01:29:25.795
And it goes through the tree.
around the hole...

1920
01:29:25.882 --> 01:29:28.145
It goes around the hole
and through the...

1921
01:29:28.232 --> 01:29:31.366
Either way. the bunny
doesn't die. right?

1922
01:29:31.453 --> 01:29:33.324
Bunny safe.
I cannot do this!

1923
01:29:33.411 --> 01:29:36.545
Yes. you can!
You can do it!

1924
01:29:36.632 --> 01:29:39.069
You're not gonna die.
I mean. eventually.

1925
01:29:39.156 --> 01:29:41.376
Oh... Oh... Do or die. little guy.

1926
01:29:41.463 --> 01:29:43.508
- Are you going first?
- Okay. Yes. I am.

1927
01:29:43.595 --> 01:29:46.816
- You sure?
- Uh-huh. Ladies...

1928
01:29:46.903 --> 01:29:48.948
I am quitting my job.

1929
01:29:59.916 --> 01:30:01.396
Ginny...

1930
01:30:01.483 --> 01:30:03.136
I'm leaving Mike
and going back to med school.

1931
01:30:03.223 --> 01:30:06.183
To freedom! Whoo!

1932
01:30:08.925 --> 01:30:12.885
What? You two can't
drop info like that

1933
01:30:12.972 --> 01:30:15.975
when I've got
a harness up my hoo-hah!

1934
01:30:16.062 --> 01:30:18.674
To friendship!

1935
01:30:18.761 --> 01:30:21.416

What is she like
off hours?

1948
01:30:58.365 --> 01:30:59.889
- It's not a problem.
- It's the same deal.

1949
01:30:59.976 --> 01:31:03.588
I'm cool. I'm fine.
I drive a Mustang.

1950
01:31:03.675 --> 01:31:05.242
- Yeah. that's good.
- And its pretty sweet.

1951
01:31:05.329 --> 01:31:08.854
- That was sarcastic.
- No. Sarcasm is not in my DNA.

1952
01:31:08.941 --> 01:31:10.900
That feels sarcastic.

1953
01:31:10.987 --> 01:31:12.989
I have a perfectly
rousing sex life.

1954
01:31:13.076 --> 01:31:14.338
- thank you very much.
- Oh. yeah?

1955
01:31:14.425 --> 01:31:15.600
Let me know when you need it.

1956
01:31:15.687 --> 01:31:17.428
But I don't.
And I'd like it.

1957
01:31:17.515 --> 01:31:19.822
I'll just...

1958
01:31:19.909 --> 01:31:22.346
It's a new friend.

1959
01:31:22.433 --> 01:31:24.435
I mean. we can do
a strip search

1960
01:31:24.522 --> 01:31:26.002
for contraband if necessary.

1961
01:31:26.089 --> 01:31:27.612
It's not necessary.

1962
01:31:27.699 --> 01:31:30.136
I... I don't know.
Just in case.

1963
01:31:30.223 --> 01:31:31.442
I've never done one before.

1964
01:31:31.529 --> 01:31:33.009
and I really want to do one.

1965
01:31:33.096 --> 01:31:34.619
You don't need to.

1966
01:31:34.706 --> 01:31:36.578
- Have you done one?
- Yes. I have.

1967
01:31:36.665 --> 01:31:37.840
- What?
- I enjoyed it.

1968
01:31:37.927 --> 01:31:40.582
When?

1969
01:31:40.669 --> 01:31:43.976
I should've gone to college.
This sucks.

1970
01:31:44.063 --> 01:31:46.631
What's your name?
What's your name?

1971
01:31:46.718 --> 01:31:48.894
Mike.

1972
01:31:48.981 --> 01:31:51.331
She's here
to protect and serve.

1973
01:31:51.418 --> 01:31:53.290
Not buzzkill and .

1974
01:31:55.118 --> 01:31:56.902
Cut it.

1975
01:31:58.513 --> 01:32:00.602
Come on! Ow! Ow!
Oh. geez louise.

1976
01:32:00.689 --> 01:32:02.299
Stand up. woman.

1977
01:32:02.386 --> 01:32:05.737
- I'm coming.
- Jesus Christ! What happened?

1978
01:32:05.824 --> 01:32:10.220
Again. please.

1979
01:32:10.307 --> 01:32:12.831
Yay!
- Okay. I can't take anymore.

1980
01:32:12.918 --> 01:32:14.311
The two of you are insane.

1981
01:32:14.398 --> 01:32:15.878
See you later. okay?

1982
01:32:15.965 --> 01:32:19.055
I have to have
some cookies and candy.

1983
01:32:19.142 --> 01:32:20.883
- Let's try it together.
- Oh!

1984
01:32:20.970 --> 01:32:23.189
Oh. my God! Uh-oh.

1985
01:32:23.276 --> 01:32:25.235
Well... Uh. yeah.

1986
01:32:25.322 --> 01:32:27.933
Uh. I'm sure he won't mind.

1987
01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:30.632
He looks like he's...

1988
01:32:30.719 --> 01:32:32.111
Well. he's crawling now.

1989
01:32:32.198 --> 01:32:33.460
- But that's not a good thing.
- Oh. no!

1990
01:32:33.548 --> 01:32:34.505
Should we call somebody?

1991
01:32:34.592 --> 01:32:35.854
Now there's a lot of blood.

1992
01:32:35.941 --> 01:32:37.377
Yeah.

1993
01:32:37.464 --> 01:32:39.554
Okay. So what about lunch?

1994
01:32:39.641 --> 01:32:41.947
I did a series
of hot takes on...

1995
01:32:42.034 --> 01:32:44.689
On weaponized incontinence.
and--

1996
01:32:47.518 --> 01:32:50.695
I did a series of hot takes

1997
01:32:50.782 --> 01:32:53.611
on weaponized in...

1998
01:32:53.698 --> 01:32:55.787
"Competence."

1999
01:32:55.874 --> 01:32:57.876
- I did a ser-- Okay.
- You did what?

2000
01:32:57.963 --> 01:32:59.617
I did a series of hot takes

2001
01:32:59.704 --> 01:33:01.967
on weaponized in... Competence.

2002
01:33:03.621 --> 01:33:05.318
"Continence" is not about...
That's pee.

2003
01:33:05.405 --> 01:33:07.146
- I went to impotence.
- That's something...

2004
01:33:07.233 --> 01:33:08.670
Okay. what a minute. Wait.

2005
01:33:08.757 --> 01:33:11.411
- Yes.
- I did a series of hot takes

2006
01:33:11.498 --> 01:33:12.804
on "weapotized"...

2007
01:33:14.327 --> 01:33:16.547
I really had it! I had it!

2008
01:33:16.634 --> 01:33:18.462
Okay. You still have it.
Do it!

2009
01:33:18.549 --> 01:33:20.899
- Okay. All right.
- Bitch.

2010
01:33:20.986 --> 01:33:23.206
Okay. You know. this is...

2011
01:33:23.293 --> 01:33:26.775
This is like the last time
anyone ever undulated?

2012
01:33:26.862 --> 01:33:28.124
By the way.
what does it mean?

2013
01:33:28.211 --> 01:33:29.342
Is it sexual?

2014
01:33:29.429 --> 01:33:31.083
- Oh. come on!
- No. I'm sorry.

2015
01:33:31.170 --> 01:33:33.738
It's undulating.
I know!

2016
01:33:33.825 --> 01:33:35.784
Well. I can kiss if I want!

2017
01:33:35.871 --> 01:33:37.394
You can kiss
whomever you...

2018
01:33:37.481 --> 01:33:38.569
Oh. you want me to kiss you?

2019
01:33:38.656 --> 01:33:39.614
- No!
- Just give me my phone.

2020
01:33:39.701 --> 01:33:41.616
I'll kiss you. I'm happy to.

2021
01:33:41.703 --> 01:33:44.270
Oh. forget it. Goodbye.

2022
01:33:44.357 --> 01:33:46.403
I need to get out of here!

2023
01:33:49.406 --> 01:33:52.888
Holy shit. It looks like
someone got murdered down here.

2024
01:33:52.975 --> 01:33:55.717
Here. you take this.
You might need a puff of that.

2025
01:33:55.804 --> 01:33:57.893
Through the rabbit hole.
Ready. one. two. three!

2026
01:33:59.242 --> 01:34:00.896
Our father who art in heaven.

2027
01:34:00.983 --> 01:34:02.332
Hallowed be thy name.
My kingdom come.

2028
01:34:02.419 --> 01:34:04.116
Thy will be done.
On earth as it is in heaven.

2029
01:34:04.203 --> 01:34:05.596
Give us this day
our daily bread.

2030
01:34:05.683 --> 01:34:07.554
Please. God.
Please. God. Please.

2031
01:34:10.732 --> 01:34:13.082
Yeah! To friendship!

2032
01:34:14.779 --> 01:34:17.434
Oh. man. This is like
an AARP commercial.
