356
00:20:00.808 --> 00:20:02.462
-I don'’t know.
-Well...

357
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:04.551
you don'’t feel like
cooking tonight.

358
00:20:04.638 --> 00:20:05.987
You'’re too tired.

359
00:20:06.074 --> 00:20:08.076
I don'’t feel like
cooking tonight.

360
00:20:08.163 --> 00:20:09.643
I'’m too tired.

361
00:20:11.993 --> 00:20:14.430
And I...

362
00:20:14.517 --> 00:20:17.912
-I don'’t feel like eating out.
-...don'’t feel like eating.

363
00:20:17.999 --> 00:20:21.524
Now. you could get takeout.

364
00:20:21.611 --> 00:20:24.875
but the lines are always
so long. and it'’s so hot.

365
00:20:24.962 --> 00:20:26.921
I don'’t even feel like
getting out of the car.

366
00:20:27.008 --> 00:20:28.357
You got a long one there.

367
00:20:30.881 --> 00:20:34.276
We...we could get takeout.

368
00:20:34.363 --> 00:20:37.845
but the lines are always
so long and it'’s so hot.

369
00:20:37.932 --> 00:20:40.587
I don'’t even feel like
getting out of the car.

370
00:20:40.674 --> 00:20:42.241
That'’s very good. Patsy.

371
00:20:42.328 --> 00:20:43.894
Thank you.

372
00:20:43.981 --> 00:20:48.986
Well. why don'’t we drive-thru?

373
00:20:49.073 --> 00:20:50.727
Drive through what?

374
00:20:50.814 --> 00:20:52.773
All right now.

375
00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.123
you'’re on your way to your
favorite restaurant. Duncan'’s.

376
00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:56.907
And you pull in.

377
00:20:56.994 --> 00:20:59.040
but you keep on going around
to the back. because...

378
00:20:59.127 --> 00:21:00.998
Whoa. whoa! What'’s this?

379
00:21:01.085 --> 00:21:03.436
Well. there'’s a little booth
back there.

380
00:21:03.523 --> 00:21:05.176
and it'’s connected
to the restaurant.

381
00:21:05.264 --> 00:21:06.526
It'’s got a big window on it.

382
00:21:06.613 --> 00:21:08.223
And you roll down
your car window.

383
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:11.618
and you give somebody your order
right from your car.

384
00:21:11.705 --> 00:21:14.316
Window to window.

385
00:21:14.403 --> 00:21:16.144
They turn around.
give it to the kitchen.

386
00:21:16.231 --> 00:21:18.320
Pay your money. get your food.
you'’re on your way.

387
00:21:18.407 --> 00:21:21.715
The fastest takeout in town.
In the country. In the world.

388
00:21:21.802 --> 00:21:24.413
Duncan'’s. home of
the world famous drive-thru.

389
00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:25.675
You don'’t need a booth.

390
00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:28.852
What'’s that?

391
00:21:28.939 --> 00:21:30.724
[Mac] You don'’t need the booth
in the back.

392
00:21:32.552 --> 00:21:34.467
You use an intercom.

393
00:21:34.554 --> 00:21:37.078
The customer drives up.

394
00:21:37.165 --> 00:21:40.342
talks into a speaker that'’s
connected inside the restaurant.

395
00:21:42.083 --> 00:21:43.606
It'’s faster.
It'’s more efficient.

396
00:21:45.086 --> 00:21:47.088
-Mac.
-An intercom?

397
00:21:47.175 --> 00:21:49.264
It'’s the future. Norm.

398
00:21:50.352 --> 00:21:51.484
Huh.

399
00:21:52.833 --> 00:21:57.707
Mac'’s intercom idea.

400
00:21:59.492 --> 00:22:01.581
Oh. my God. I'’m going to be
rolling in it!

401
00:22:01.668 --> 00:22:03.931
Hey. this calls
for some more Riunite.

402
00:22:04.018 --> 00:22:06.934
And I know where
there'’s one more bottle.

403
00:22:07.021 --> 00:22:09.284
Oh. I can'’t stand it anymore.
The wine can wait.

404
00:22:09.371 --> 00:22:11.242
Hey. Mac. I'’m proud
to announce...

405
00:22:12.896 --> 00:22:15.072
that after today'’s
strange turn of events.

406
00:22:15.159 --> 00:22:20.730
I am ready to make you the new
assistant manager of Duncan'’s.

407
00:22:20.817 --> 00:22:23.516
Malcolm'’s going to need
all the help he can get.

408
00:22:25.387 --> 00:22:27.650
I'’ll go get the cups.

409
00:22:27.737 --> 00:22:30.087
I can'’t think of anybody
better qualified to assist him.

410
00:22:30.174 --> 00:22:31.350
Congratulations.

411
00:22:35.876 --> 00:22:37.312
I'’ll get the wine.

412
00:22:52.371 --> 00:22:54.982
[Norm] I am quite
the Chatty Cathy tonight. huh?

413
00:22:56.679 --> 00:22:58.333
Yeah.

414
00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.291
Whoa. easy there. Macky.

415
00:23:01.684 --> 00:23:02.816
Yeah.

416
00:23:05.732 --> 00:23:08.082
-[grunts]
-Got it.

417
00:23:10.867 --> 00:23:12.695
Oh. my God.

418
00:23:14.305 --> 00:23:17.570
Hey. good for you.
Good for you.

419
00:23:17.657 --> 00:23:19.267
I just wish I saw it.

420
00:23:19.354 --> 00:23:21.312
Jesus. Pat.
I didn'’t hit him. all right?

421
00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.445
I couldn'’t get the wine
out of the fridge.

422
00:23:23.532 --> 00:23:25.316
and the door...

423
00:23:25.404 --> 00:23:26.796
I don'’t know.

424
00:23:26.883 --> 00:23:29.973
but I don'’t think
he'’s breathing.

425
00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:31.192
[whispering]
What?

426
00:23:33.324 --> 00:23:35.370
I think he'’s dead.

427
00:23:42.116 --> 00:23:43.770
Order up!

428
00:23:43.857 --> 00:23:45.336
[groans]

429
00:23:54.737 --> 00:23:56.435
We have to do it tomorrow.

430
00:23:56.522 --> 00:23:58.219
Tomorrow?

431
00:24:02.179 --> 00:24:04.094
Pat. what are we talking about?

432
00:24:04.181 --> 00:24:06.488
Before he starts shooting his
mouth off about the drive-thru.

433
00:24:07.924 --> 00:24:09.752
-We have something tomorrow.
-What?

434
00:24:09.839 --> 00:24:11.537
-Banko'’s birthday.
-Shit!

435
00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.327
Pat...

436
00:24:19.414 --> 00:24:21.155
what are we doing?

437
00:24:21.242 --> 00:24:23.070
We'’re coming to our
fucking senses.

438
00:24:23.157 --> 00:24:24.724
that'’s what we'’re doing.

439
00:24:24.811 --> 00:24:27.335
It was like I could read
your mind in there.

440
00:24:27.422 --> 00:24:29.032
I knew exactly
what you were thinking.

441
00:24:29.119 --> 00:24:30.773
I didn'’t know
what I was thinking. Pat.

442
00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:32.340
Mac. look at me.

443
00:24:33.863 --> 00:24:35.299
Yes. you did.

444
00:24:35.386 --> 00:24:36.779
You did.

445
00:24:38.564 --> 00:24:40.870
Douglas was nothing.

446
00:24:40.957 --> 00:24:43.830
We have to aim higher.

447
00:24:43.917 --> 00:24:46.397
We can'’t exactly get Norm fired.
now can we?

448
00:24:47.486 --> 00:24:48.748
I knew about the drive-thru.

449
00:24:48.835 --> 00:24:50.140
Of course you did.
Of course.

450
00:24:50.227 --> 00:24:52.316
Finally. finally
he'’s going to use

451
00:24:52.403 --> 00:24:54.057
some of your ideas.
and what do we get?

452
00:24:54.144 --> 00:24:56.886
I'’m the fucking
assistant manager'’s wife?

453
00:24:56.973 --> 00:24:59.019
-I didn'’t tell him--
-Listen to me. Listen to me.

454
00:24:59.106 --> 00:25:01.021
Robberies...

455
00:25:01.108 --> 00:25:03.545
go bad all the time.
and...

456
00:25:05.242 --> 00:25:06.548
accidents happen.

457
00:25:09.595 --> 00:25:10.987
We'’re not bad people. Mac.

458
00:25:11.074 --> 00:25:12.206
We'’re just...

459
00:25:14.034 --> 00:25:17.298
underachievers that have
to make up for lost time.

460
00:25:17.385 --> 00:25:18.865
Pat...

461
00:25:18.952 --> 00:25:21.258
Don'’t you think you deserve it.
Mac?

462
00:25:21.345 --> 00:25:23.260
[whispering]
Huh? Don'’t you?

463
00:25:24.784 --> 00:25:26.568
-Huh?
-Yeah.

464
00:25:26.655 --> 00:25:27.874
[Pat]
Yeah.

465
00:25:29.092 --> 00:25:30.529
[both moan softly]

466
00:25:33.009 --> 00:25:37.013
Now all we need
is the combination to the safe.

467
00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:39.059
and it'’ll look
more like a robbery.

468
00:25:39.146 --> 00:25:40.974
We can get some
starting-out money.

469
00:25:41.061 --> 00:25:43.237
Fuck! Fuckety fuck!

470
00:25:43.324 --> 00:25:46.022
Oh. it'’s Andy. It'’s just Andy.

471
00:25:46.109 --> 00:25:48.068
Hey. Andy.

472
00:25:48.155 --> 00:25:49.939
How'’s it going?

473
00:25:50.026 --> 00:25:53.552
You two are still like
a couple of teenagers.

474
00:25:53.639 --> 00:25:55.249
[Mac. chuckling]
Where are you living?

475
00:25:55.336 --> 00:25:57.338
[Andy]
In back of McLeary'’s garage.

476
00:25:57.425 --> 00:25:59.122
Joe'’s putting me up.

477
00:25:59.209 --> 00:26:01.298
-Joey'’s a nice...
-Tell Joey we say hi.

478
00:26:01.385 --> 00:26:04.345
Okay. I'’ll give you two back
your privacy.

479
00:26:06.739 --> 00:26:09.306
This town is too fucking small.

480
00:26:11.918 --> 00:26:13.920
[dice rattling]

481
00:26:14.007 --> 00:26:15.878
-Yahtzee.
-Jesus. Banko.

482
00:26:15.965 --> 00:26:17.445
That'’s a shitload
of Yahtzees.

483
00:26:17.532 --> 00:26:18.881
[Joan]
You'’re a terrific player.

484
00:26:18.968 --> 00:26:21.449
[Banko]
Thanks. I usually just think.

485
00:26:21.536 --> 00:26:26.019
"Wouldn'’t it be great
to get a Yahtzee right now?"

486
00:26:26.106 --> 00:26:28.282
And then sometimes I get it.

487
00:26:28.369 --> 00:26:31.067
Sometimes I don'’t.
You'’re up. Pat.

488
00:26:31.154 --> 00:26:33.461
Mac. you sound awful.

489
00:26:37.073 --> 00:26:38.292
[sneezes loudly]

490
00:26:38.379 --> 00:26:39.772
Yeah. see.
I have to take him home.

491
00:26:39.859 --> 00:26:41.600
-[coughing]
-He'’s fine.

492
00:26:41.687 --> 00:26:43.427
I don'’t think he is.
He'’s sick. Look at him.

493
00:26:43.514 --> 00:26:46.430
He just needs another shot.
Mac. you want do a shot?

494
00:26:46.517 --> 00:26:47.823
I think that might help.

495
00:26:54.613 --> 00:26:56.397
Yeah. better call it a night.

496
00:26:56.484 --> 00:26:57.659
[Pat]
Yup.

497
00:26:57.746 --> 00:26:58.921
Oh. hey. there'’s Peg.

498
00:26:59.008 --> 00:27:00.619
She made it.

499
00:27:00.706 --> 00:27:01.924
My neighbor. Peg.

500
00:27:02.011 --> 00:27:04.231
[all]
Hey. Hi. Peg.

501
00:27:06.581 --> 00:27:08.148
We thought you were
pulling a double.

502
00:27:08.235 --> 00:27:09.889
I'’m in the middle of it.

503
00:27:09.976 --> 00:27:11.891
What do you think this is.
my Yahtzee outfit?

504
00:27:11.978 --> 00:27:13.501
[laughs]

505
00:27:16.722 --> 00:27:18.898
Oh. hey. Mac isn'’t feeling well.

506
00:27:18.985 --> 00:27:20.639
Maybe you could see
if he has a fever...

507
00:27:20.726 --> 00:27:22.162
Oh. no. I...

508
00:27:22.249 --> 00:27:24.294
Sorry.

509
00:27:24.381 --> 00:27:25.556
I'’ll be right back.

510
00:27:34.653 --> 00:27:36.698
Whose turn is it?

511
00:27:36.785 --> 00:27:39.179
[crickets chirping]

512
00:27:48.492 --> 00:27:49.668
What?

513
00:27:52.279 --> 00:27:53.715
This place gives me
the creeps.

514
00:28:08.077 --> 00:28:09.775
Excuse me. can I get
some more ketchup?

515
00:28:11.602 --> 00:28:12.734
Oh. no problem.

516
00:28:30.056 --> 00:28:31.318
[door chimes jingle]

517
00:28:34.495 --> 00:28:35.888
Careful driving.

518
00:28:38.891 --> 00:28:40.153
Wake up. Dad.

519
00:28:44.374 --> 00:28:45.680
I'’m quitting.

520
00:28:47.116 --> 00:28:50.206
Oh. is it 10:00 already?

521
00:28:50.293 --> 00:28:52.339
No. it'’s not quitting time.
I'’m just quitting.

522
00:28:52.426 --> 00:28:53.949
It'’s over. I'’m done.

523
00:28:54.036 --> 00:28:55.777
Oh. no. now. wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

524
00:28:55.864 --> 00:28:57.431
I thought we had a deal.

525
00:28:57.518 --> 00:28:58.867
Your deal sucks. Dad.

526
00:28:58.954 --> 00:29:00.303
I can'’t stand this
fucking place.

527
00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:02.741
Mrs. Lenox. thank you.
You can go now.

528
00:29:02.828 --> 00:29:05.004
What is it. young man.

-I don'’t know.

Baba ghanoush.
It'’s a vegetarian dish.

No.

757
00:41:13.862 --> 00:41:16.691
They called me in
because the Scotland PD

758
00:41:16.778 --> 00:41:18.737
is a bit understaffed
for this kind of thing.

759
00:41:18.824 --> 00:41:21.435

they'’re not kidding.

-Pick up. please.

886
00:47:15.223 --> 00:47:16.877
Thanks for my thrill.

887
00:47:16.964 --> 00:47:19.097
Have you been in town
this whole time. Lieutenant?

888
00:47:19.184 --> 00:47:21.229
No. weeks ago I left.

889
00:47:21.316 --> 00:47:23.231
I let them handle it.

890
00:47:23.318 --> 00:47:24.493
It seemed cut-and-dry.

891
00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:26.104
It isn'’t?

892
00:47:26.191 --> 00:47:27.366
[McDuff]
Apparently not.

893
00:47:27.453 --> 00:47:28.802
The DA'’s letting him go.

894
00:47:30.325 --> 00:47:32.023
What about Norm'’s jewelry?

895
00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:33.241
I'’m wearing it.

896
00:47:35.374 --> 00:47:37.028
Just kidding.

897
00:47:37.115 --> 00:47:38.377
It'’s all we had.

898
00:47:38.464 --> 00:47:39.726
Believe it or not.

899
00:47:39.813 --> 00:47:41.684
it'’s not enough
to hold him.

900
00:47:41.771 --> 00:47:43.208
No witness.
No confession.

901
00:47:43.295 --> 00:47:45.384
He'’s still a suspect.
but I think...

902
00:47:45.471 --> 00:47:46.951
Is this some kind of dip?

903
00:47:47.038 --> 00:47:48.909
Um. yes. it is.

904
00:47:48.996 --> 00:47:51.303
It'’s for ice cream.
Would you like one. Lieutenant?

905
00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:53.479
-I'’ll pay you for it.
-That'’s okay.

906
00:47:57.135 --> 00:47:59.398
So you were saying
that you were thinking...?

907
00:47:59.485 --> 00:48:02.705
[McDuff] I think we might be
going in a different direction.

908
00:48:02.792 --> 00:48:07.449
which. may I say. you two
have done amazing things.

909
00:48:07.536 --> 00:48:09.582
I hardly recognized the place.

910
00:48:09.669 --> 00:48:10.975
Thanks.

911
00:48:11.062 --> 00:48:13.020
Of course. when I saw it last.

912
00:48:13.107 --> 00:48:15.718
there was a dead body
in the fryolater.

913
00:48:15.805 --> 00:48:16.981
[laughs]

914
00:48:20.245 --> 00:48:22.638
Lieutenant. Channel 5
is doing a story

915
00:48:22.725 --> 00:48:25.293
on our drive-thru next week.
and we'’re going to have a party.

916
00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:26.773
You should bring
your family.

917
00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:29.167
-Might do that.
-[Kevin] Lieutenant?

918
00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:32.083
Mr. McKane.

919
00:48:33.432 --> 00:48:35.564
What do you say
we step outside

920
00:48:35.651 --> 00:48:38.437
and you can show me exactly
what you'’re talking about.

921
00:48:38.524 --> 00:48:39.829
You want to bring your son?

922
00:48:39.917 --> 00:48:41.135
No. he'’s fine.

923
00:48:53.452 --> 00:48:55.367
[car horn honking]

924
00:48:55.454 --> 00:48:58.022
Now. if you'’re going to have
a kegger. just keep it quiet.

925
00:48:58.109 --> 00:49:00.589
I know how you drama geeks
like to party.

926
00:49:00.676 --> 00:49:03.462
You know. they'’re trying to make
gambling legal in Atlantic City.

927
00:49:03.549 --> 00:49:05.812
All right! I got the deed
to the house in my pocket.

928
00:49:05.899 --> 00:49:07.857
Shut up. Malcolm.
It'’s a disease.

929
00:49:07.945 --> 00:49:11.035
Sammy lost. like. a whole year'’s
salary once in Vegas.

930
00:49:11.122 --> 00:49:12.384
Sammy who?

931
00:49:13.515 --> 00:49:15.213
Davis. Jr.

932
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:19.652
You'’re a freak. Donald.

933
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:31.229
Oh. yeah. it was--
It was definitely Malcolm.

934
00:49:31.316 --> 00:49:33.492
and he was coming out of here
like a bat out of hell.

935
00:49:33.579 --> 00:49:35.363
We were coming
from that direction. and...

936
00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:36.669
"We"?

937
00:49:36.756 --> 00:49:38.453
...going exactly
the legal limit.

938
00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:40.760
-What?
-You said "we" just now.

939
00:49:40.847 --> 00:49:42.980
When you called me.
you said you were alone.

940
00:49:44.546 --> 00:49:46.505
No. I wasn'’t alone.
I was...

941
00:49:46.592 --> 00:49:49.421
-I was giving somebody a lift.
-Who'’s that?

942
00:49:51.771 --> 00:49:53.077
Oh. Jesus.

943
00:49:55.079 --> 00:49:56.428
Lieutenant.
I-I love my wife.

944
00:49:56.515 --> 00:49:58.125
I-I-I love her to death.

945
00:49:58.212 --> 00:50:00.475
The devil'’s out to destroy me.

946
00:50:00.562 --> 00:50:02.956
I don'’t know.
he'’s out to take me down.

947
00:50:03.043 --> 00:50:04.349
I'’m so ashamed.

948
00:50:04.436 --> 00:50:06.307
Just. I'’m so ashamed.

949
00:50:07.526 --> 00:50:09.267
Well. take it easy.

950
00:50:09.354 --> 00:50:11.747
I don'’t need to know.
It'’s not important.

951
00:50:11.834 --> 00:50:13.053
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

952
00:50:14.968 --> 00:50:17.492
If you ever need a tan...

953
00:50:17.579 --> 00:50:19.755
Hey!

954
00:50:26.327 --> 00:50:28.025
Take it to my grave.

955
00:50:30.331 --> 00:50:33.465
I guess that'’s
standard procedure.

956
00:50:33.552 --> 00:50:34.770
Huh.

957
00:50:36.816 --> 00:50:38.600
I mean. like a maniac.

958
00:50:38.687 --> 00:50:41.864
F this and F that
about his poor father

959
00:50:41.951 --> 00:50:43.344
who just wanted
the best for him.

960
00:50:43.431 --> 00:50:45.085
God bless him.

961
00:50:45.172 --> 00:50:47.087
Again. when you left.

962
00:50:47.174 --> 00:50:49.089
they were still
in the middle of it?

963
00:50:49.176 --> 00:50:50.699
And no one else was there?

964
00:50:50.786 --> 00:50:52.440
No one.

965
00:50:52.527 --> 00:50:54.790
Malcolm had just thrown out
that poor customer

966
00:50:54.877 --> 00:50:56.357
and closed the place early.

967
00:50:56.444 --> 00:50:58.707
something his father
never would have done.

968
00:50:58.794 --> 00:51:00.753
How was your relationship
with Malcolm?

969
00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:06.759
Fine. I mean. he was a rude.
selfish. evil young man.

970
00:51:06.846 --> 00:51:08.935
But I never once judged him.

971
00:51:09.022 --> 00:51:10.415
It'’s not my way.

972
00:51:11.677 --> 00:51:12.852
Thanks.

973
00:51:12.939 --> 00:51:14.419
You'’ve been helpful.

974
00:51:14.506 --> 00:51:16.029
Oh. you'’re welcome.

975
00:51:16.116 --> 00:51:17.291
Oh.

976
00:51:17.378 --> 00:51:18.510
Thanks.

977
00:51:20.425 --> 00:51:21.600
Mr. Bankoni.

978
00:51:21.687 --> 00:51:23.210
Until 2:00 a.m.

979
00:51:23.297 --> 00:51:25.604
Everybody was there.

980
00:51:25.691 --> 00:51:28.433
Mac is really a great player.
but he wasn'’t feeling too well.

981
00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:30.826
So you didn'’t play Yahtzee
with Malcolm that night?

982
00:51:30.913 --> 00:51:32.872
No.

983
00:51:32.959 --> 00:51:35.527
No. he-- He wouldn'’t
go out with us.

984
00:51:35.614 --> 00:51:37.920
You seen Malcolm and his dad
quarrel?

985
00:51:38.007 --> 00:51:39.879
Yeah. all the time.

986
00:51:43.317 --> 00:51:44.927
You don'’t think Malcolm...?

987
00:51:45.014 --> 00:51:46.929
I don'’t know.

988
00:51:47.016 --> 00:51:49.018
Thanks. You'’ve been helpful too.

989
00:51:50.107 --> 00:51:51.238
Oh.

990
00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:53.501
Okay.

991
00:51:56.330 --> 00:51:58.811
I'’m not going to hug you
afterwards. okay?

992
00:51:58.898 --> 00:52:01.814
No offense. but I'’d be pleased
if you didn'’t.

993
00:52:01.901 --> 00:52:03.685
I can'’t get over this place.

994
00:52:05.122 --> 00:52:08.473
Did Mr. Duncan
have this much success?

995
00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:10.518
Well. he did all right.
you know?

996
00:52:10.605 --> 00:52:12.781
Primarily he knew the doughnuts.
though.

997
00:52:12.868 --> 00:52:14.435
Yeah. I got you.

998
00:52:14.522 --> 00:52:15.958
It looks like it cost
a fortune.

999
00:52:16.045 --> 00:52:18.526
Well. Malcolm gave us
a damn good deal.

1000
00:52:18.613 --> 00:52:20.789
and the truck'’s used...

1001
00:52:20.876 --> 00:52:22.748
When did you think
of that drive-thru?

1002
00:52:22.835 --> 00:52:25.011
Thinking of getting
into the business. Lieutenant?

1003
00:52:25.098 --> 00:52:26.578
You know.
I'’m impressed.

1004
00:52:26.665 --> 00:52:28.580
Mr. Bankoni said...

1005
00:52:28.667 --> 00:52:31.148
you'’ve always had great ideas
with the place.

1006
00:52:31.235 --> 00:52:35.848
He said he wasn'’t surprised
at all by your success.

1007
00:52:35.935 --> 00:52:37.589
Is that what he said?

1008
00:52:39.286 --> 00:52:41.810
And this traveling
french fry truck...

1009
00:52:41.897 --> 00:52:44.422
-French fry truck. that right?
-Yeah. that'’s right.

1010
00:52:44.509 --> 00:52:46.337
You'’re going to give
the fries away. right?

1011
00:52:46.424 --> 00:52:48.600
Yeah. yeah. yeah.
once they taste my fries...

1012
00:52:48.687 --> 00:52:50.297
-They need them. More. more.
-Yeah!

1013
00:52:50.384 --> 00:52:52.081
-That'’s right.
-That'’s right.

1014
00:52:52.169 --> 00:52:55.346
Get them hooked.
like kids on drugs.

1015
00:52:55.433 --> 00:52:56.738
It'’s wonderful.

1016
00:53:00.264 --> 00:53:03.658
I think he thinks
Malcolm did it.

1017
00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.185
-What?
-I don'’t know.

1018
00:53:08.272 --> 00:53:10.535
He asked a lot of questions
about him.

1019
00:53:15.366 --> 00:53:17.150
Oh. my God.

1020
00:53:17.237 --> 00:53:19.587
-It can'’t be true.
-No.

1021
00:53:21.285 --> 00:53:22.895
Of course not. but...

1022
00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:28.161
But he really hated
his father.

1023
00:53:28.248 --> 00:53:30.816
"Put the knife down. Malcolm.
Just put it down."

1024
00:53:32.296 --> 00:53:33.775
Yeah.

1025
00:53:33.862 --> 00:53:35.386
And then he put it down.

1026
00:53:38.389 --> 00:53:42.871
Hey. you want me to drop off the
van at the garage when I'’m done?

1027
00:53:42.958 --> 00:53:44.612
It'’s been running
kind of lousy.

1028
00:53:52.664 --> 00:53:54.361
Mac?

1029
00:53:54.448 --> 00:53:57.016
Oh. yeah.
That'’d be fine.

1030
00:54:01.325 --> 00:54:04.458
You and Mr. McB.

1031
00:54:04.545 --> 00:54:06.721
were out with the Bankoni party
that night?

1032
00:54:06.808 --> 00:54:08.549
Yes.

1033
00:54:08.636 --> 00:54:10.769
Yeah. I'’m an awful
Yahtzee player.

1034
00:54:10.856 --> 00:54:13.337
Oh. I'’m not going
to write that down.

1035
00:54:13.424 --> 00:54:14.686
Thank you.

1036
00:54:17.645 --> 00:54:18.777
Mac?

1037
00:54:20.474 --> 00:54:22.215
What?

1038
00:54:22.302 --> 00:54:24.652
How come you never told me
about the drive-thru idea?

1039
00:54:27.351 --> 00:54:28.656
What are you talking about?

1040
00:54:28.743 --> 00:54:30.441
You told me
all your other ideas.

1041
00:54:30.528 --> 00:54:32.312
We'’d be out drinking.

1042
00:54:32.399 --> 00:54:34.445
How come you never told me
about that one?

1043
00:54:36.273 --> 00:54:37.578
It just came to me.
I guess.

1044
00:54:39.014 --> 00:54:40.668
-When?
-What the fuck?

1045
00:54:40.755 --> 00:54:43.715
What are you. like.
Lieutenant McJunior. or what?

1046
00:54:46.892 --> 00:54:48.502
Do you have a big family?

1047
00:54:49.634 --> 00:54:51.244
Two wives and a boy.

1048
00:54:51.331 --> 00:54:53.464
-Oh.
-I mean. two boys and a wife.

1049
00:54:53.551 --> 00:54:56.031
Ah. Well. that other
would be convenient. I guess.

1050
00:54:58.730 --> 00:55:00.297
-Thanks.
-Pat.

1051
00:55:01.385 --> 00:55:02.603

Is there something wrong?

1294
01:07:46.888 --> 01:07:49.108
I need to ask Mr. Bankoni
a question.

at my house.

1302
01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:38.375
Why do I always
have to be in the back?

1303
01:08:38.462 --> 01:08:41.291
What? Because you said
you liked it in the back.

01:13:22.963 --> 01:13:25.226
Yeah. Joey. Banko will get it
in the morning.

1397
01:13:27.054 --> 01:13:28.447
Okay. I'’ll tell him.

1398
01:13:30.493 --> 01:13:32.712
He said it'’s Saturday.
They'’re not open till 12:00.

1399
01:13:32.799 --> 01:13:34.888
-What are you doing?
-Do we have any Valium left?

1400
01:13:34.975 --> 01:13:37.587
-What are you doing?
-I said. do we have any Valium?

1401
01:13:37.674 --> 01:13:39.153
Yes. Why?

1402
01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:42.026
Mix it with some Alka-Seltzer.

1403
01:13:42.113 --> 01:13:44.550
If Banko wakes up.
give it to him.

1404
01:13:44.637 --> 01:13:46.247
I'’ll take care of the rest.

1405
01:13:46.334 --> 01:13:48.075
No. no. no.
Mac. no.

1406
01:13:48.162 --> 01:13:49.599
You have to talk to me.

1407
01:13:49.686 --> 01:13:51.296
You have to tell me
what you'’re doing.

1408
01:13:51.383 --> 01:13:52.689
-I don'’t know.
-You don'’t know?

1409
01:13:52.776 --> 01:13:54.255
I said I don'’t know!

1410
01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:57.737
It'’s a surprise.

1411
01:14:00.044 --> 01:14:01.698
I'’ll take care of it.

1412
01:14:03.221 --> 01:14:04.614
Get off my fucking back.

1413
01:14:07.225 --> 01:14:08.400
Yeah?

1414
01:14:22.501 --> 01:14:23.937
Shit!

1415
01:14:34.687 --> 01:14:35.862
[sighs]

1416
01:14:52.139 --> 01:14:53.271
[grunts]
Fuck!

1417
01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:57.231
[racks gun]

1418
01:14:57.318 --> 01:14:59.059
Whoa! Jesus.

1419
01:14:59.146 --> 01:15:00.713
Andy. it'’s me.

1420
01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:02.193
It'’s Mac.

1421
01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:03.455
-Mac?
-Yeah.

1422
01:15:03.542 --> 01:15:05.413
-Is that you?
-It'’s me.

1423
01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:06.937
Put the gun down.

1424
01:15:08.547 --> 01:15:10.157
Sorry.

1425
01:15:10.244 --> 01:15:13.509
I'’ve been a little
paranoid lately.

1426
01:15:13.596 --> 01:15:15.641
I'’ll bet.

1427
01:15:15.728 --> 01:15:17.469
What are you doing here?

1428
01:15:18.818 --> 01:15:21.212
Picking up the french fry truck.

1429
01:15:22.343 --> 01:15:24.084
At 2:00 a.m.

1430
01:15:24.171 --> 01:15:26.304
Yeah. Yeah.

1431
01:15:28.001 --> 01:15:29.699
So you'’re here now?
You'’re not...

1432
01:15:29.786 --> 01:15:31.875
In jail?
Not anymore.

1433
01:15:31.962 --> 01:15:33.964
They got nothing on me.

1434
01:15:34.051 --> 01:15:37.358
I'’ll tell you. Mac.
I didn'’t do it.

1435
01:15:37.445 --> 01:15:41.580
I woke up covered in jewelry.

1436
01:15:42.929 --> 01:15:44.322
Say. is that your gun. Andy?

1437
01:15:45.410 --> 01:15:47.020
Yes. sir.

1438
01:15:47.107 --> 01:15:48.892
Yeah. that'’s my baby.

1439
01:15:48.979 --> 01:15:50.458
-You want to hold her?
-No.

1440
01:15:50.546 --> 01:15:52.243
No. I'’m not into guns.

1441
01:15:53.853 --> 01:15:56.813
Say. you got a couple glasses
back there?

1442
01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:58.336
[both laugh]

1443
01:15:59.859 --> 01:16:02.949
That'’s the best offer
I had in months.

1444
01:16:03.036 --> 01:16:04.603
Come on in.

1445
01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:05.996
You'’re my savior.

1446
01:16:07.737 --> 01:16:09.303
-How'’s Pat?
-Oh. you know. she'’s good.

1447
01:16:09.390 --> 01:16:10.566
Fine.

1448
01:16:17.442 --> 01:16:18.835
[door closes]

1449
01:16:36.548 --> 01:16:37.897
Give me your shirt.

1450
01:16:41.858 --> 01:16:43.903
[man. over radio]
Letting go of my worthlessness

1451
01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:46.689
is the gateway to rapture.

1452
01:16:50.344 --> 01:16:53.565
Hey. you really tied one on
yesterday.

1453
01:16:57.351 --> 01:16:58.614
You were at our place.

1454
01:17:00.354 --> 01:17:02.574
I need you to pick up the truck.

1455
01:17:02.661 --> 01:17:04.837
I'’ll drop you on the way
to the restaurant.

1456
01:17:04.924 --> 01:17:07.710
-Right now? What time is it?
-It'’s 9:00.

1457
01:17:07.797 --> 01:17:09.276
But we got to haul ass.

1458
01:17:09.363 --> 01:17:10.669
[groans softly]

1459
01:17:33.736 --> 01:17:35.172
[Banko]
It'’s closed.

1460
01:17:35.259 --> 01:17:37.609
[Mac]
Um. yeah. I know.

1461
01:17:37.696 --> 01:17:41.482
He. uh. said he was going
to leave the keys for us.

1462
01:17:41.569 --> 01:17:43.136
Look and see
if they'’re in the truck.

1463
01:17:43.223 --> 01:17:44.703
I'’ll see if he left this open.

1464
01:17:52.929 --> 01:17:54.495
They'’re not in there.

1465
01:17:57.237 --> 01:17:58.412
Mac?

1466
01:18:08.422 --> 01:18:10.120
[gunshot]

1467
01:18:11.469 --> 01:18:12.775
[Ed]
I'’m telling you.

1468
01:18:12.862 --> 01:18:14.907
I called it 95 times.
Lieutenant.

1469
01:18:14.994 --> 01:18:17.518
I practically
got it memorized.

1470
01:18:17.605 --> 01:18:19.042
He'’s just not there.

1471
01:18:19.129 --> 01:18:20.783
Huh. Anybody call?

1472
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:22.785
Uh-huh.

1473
01:18:22.872 --> 01:18:24.047
-For me?
-For you?

1474
01:18:24.134 --> 01:18:25.962
Oh. yeah. yeah.

1475
01:18:26.049 --> 01:18:27.528
Mrs. McBeth called.

1476
01:18:27.615 --> 01:18:29.313
She said she'’s sorry.

1477
01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:32.533
but she thinks she gave you
the wrong map. and...

1478
01:18:33.926 --> 01:18:35.406
-She said something else.
-Really?

1479
01:18:35.493 --> 01:18:36.973
What time she call?

1480
01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:40.454
Around three hours
after you left.

1481
01:18:40.541 --> 01:18:42.152
That'’s convenient.

1482
01:18:42.239 --> 01:18:44.197
Oh. that'’s it.

1483
01:18:44.284 --> 01:18:47.374
She said that she hoped
it wasn'’t too inconvenient.

1484
01:18:50.421 --> 01:18:51.857
-[feedback squeals]
-Hello? Hello?

1485
01:18:51.944 --> 01:18:53.076

1486
01:18:54.686 --> 01:18:56.514
-Check?
-[man] Hey. where does this go?

1487
01:18:56.601 --> 01:18:58.472
Just put the bitch
in the corner. guys.

1488
01:19:18.144 --> 01:19:19.624
-They'’re ready.
-Motherfucker!

1489
01:19:20.712 --> 01:19:21.974
Jesus.

1490
01:19:23.106 --> 01:19:24.542
Sorry. Richard.

1491
01:19:24.629 --> 01:19:26.457
We'’re a little tense...
Robert.

1492
01:19:26.544 --> 01:19:27.937
Robert. Sorry. Robert.
Thank you.

1493

1496
01:20:06.497 --> 01:20:07.715
[Mac]
Thank you...

[smatter of applause]

1499
01:20:24.297 --> 01:20:26.473
Does anybody have
any questions?

1500
01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:27.910
Mrs. McGuire?

1501
01:20:27.997 --> 01:20:30.042
I am so proud of you kids.

1502
01:20:30.129 --> 01:20:32.044
And. Pat. you look terrific.

1503
01:20:32.131 --> 01:20:34.090
Now don'’t tell me that fit
right off the rack.

1504
01:20:34.177 --> 01:20:35.743
Yes. it did. Garrison'’s.

1505
01:20:35.831 --> 01:20:37.049
[Mrs. McGuire]
You don'’t say?

1506
01:20:37.136 --> 01:20:39.269
Well. you look terrific.

1507
01:20:39.356 --> 01:20:40.879
Doesn'’t she. everybody?

1508
01:20:40.966 --> 01:20:42.750
-[Mrs. McGuire laughs]
-[crowd applauds]

1509
01:20:46.406 --> 01:20:47.581
Banko.

1510
01:20:52.586 --> 01:20:54.066
Why did you kill me?

1511
01:20:59.942 --> 01:21:02.031
[Mac]
What are you doing here?

1512
01:21:02.118 --> 01:21:03.989
Why did you kill me?

1513
01:21:04.076 --> 01:21:05.686
-[stammers]
-Maybe you should--

1514
01:21:05.773 --> 01:21:07.863
-You should go sit down.
-I didn'’t-- Who did this?

1515
01:21:07.950 --> 01:21:10.387
Maybe he should go sit down!
Maybe he should go sit down!

1516
01:21:10.474 --> 01:21:12.041
My husband is a little
overworked.

1517
01:21:12.128 --> 01:21:13.607
-Why did you kill me?
-[Mac] Stop!

1518
01:21:13.694 --> 01:21:14.870
You stop saying that!

1519
01:21:25.489 --> 01:21:27.752
My husband is very
overworked.

1520
01:21:27.839 --> 01:21:32.148
Actually. he'’s been working
very hard to-to-to-to--

1521
01:21:32.235 --> 01:21:35.151
To put this thing together.
and he has a condition

1522
01:21:35.238 --> 01:21:37.457
since he was a boy.

1523
01:21:39.895 --> 01:21:41.200
So why don'’t we all...?

1524
01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:45.509
[smatter of applause]

1525
01:21:50.383 --> 01:21:51.907
What the hell was that?

1526
01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:56.041
I call that a bad press
conference.

1527
01:22:00.872 --> 01:22:02.004
I just...

1528
01:22:03.657 --> 01:22:05.181
There. I got to go.
I got to go.

1529
01:22:05.268 --> 01:22:06.791
No. What?
No. you can'’t leave.

1530
01:22:06.878 --> 01:22:08.488
-You can'’t leave.
-I got to find them.

1531
01:22:08.575 --> 01:22:10.229
They'’ll tell me what'’s
gonna happen.

1532
01:22:10.316 --> 01:22:11.883
Who? Who? Mac!

1533
01:22:11.970 --> 01:22:14.146
Mac. please don'’t leave.

1534
01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:16.932
Mac!

01:22:20.544 --> 01:22:22.024
[sighs]

1536
01:22:27.943 --> 01:22:29.422
Is everybody having
a nice time?

1537
01:22:29.509 --> 01:22:31.555
Donald. is that you?

1538
01:22:31.642 --> 01:22:32.904
-No.
-How are you?

1539
01:22:32.991 --> 01:22:34.514
-Lousy.
-How'’s your father?

1540
01:22:34.601 --> 01:22:35.733
-Dead.
-Oh!

1541
01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:36.952
[laughs]

1542
01:22:39.650 --> 01:22:40.956
[wind gusting]

1543
01:22:54.273 --> 01:22:55.971
[Joey] And that'’s it.
That'’s all I know.

1544
01:22:56.058 --> 01:22:57.798
-All right. Thanks.
-Sure.

1545
01:22:57.885 --> 01:22:59.800
There'’s the wife and kids.
If you'’ll excuse me.

1546
01:22:59.887 --> 01:23:01.411
Take it easy. Ed.

1547
01:23:01.498 --> 01:23:03.848
Oh. you too. Joey.
How'’s the kids doing?

1548
01:23:03.935 --> 01:23:05.589
Right.

1549
01:23:05.676 --> 01:23:07.417
Are you going to go
arrest them?

1550
01:23:07.504 --> 01:23:10.376
For what? Throwing a party?
There'’s nothing there.

1551
01:23:10.463 --> 01:23:12.900
Andy'’s gun killed Banko.
Now he'’s missing.

1552
01:23:15.381 --> 01:23:16.992
[children laughing]

1553

[pounds on door]

1554
01:23:33.356 --> 01:23:35.271
Is everything okay. Pat?
We heard about Banko.

1555
01:23:35.358 --> 01:23:37.838
No. everything is not okay.
Frank.

1556
01:23:37.925 --> 01:23:40.711
But I need some more ointment
for my burn.

1557
01:23:40.798 --> 01:23:42.582
Your burn?

1558
01:23:42.669 --> 01:23:45.455
Oh. come on. don'’t start
that bullshit with me again.

1559
01:23:45.542 --> 01:23:47.413
Just give me the fucking
ointment. okay?

1560
01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:49.328
-I don'’t see a burn--
-I don'’t give a fuck

1561
01:23:49.415 --> 01:23:51.113
what you see or don'’t see.

1562
01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:52.723
Just get me the ointment.
all right?

1563
01:23:52.810 --> 01:23:55.204
And I don'’t want
one of those little...

1564
01:23:55.291 --> 01:23:56.683
baby shit-ass tubes.

1565
01:23:56.770 --> 01:23:58.033
I need a vat of it.

1566

is falling off!
