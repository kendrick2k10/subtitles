4
00:01:05.708 --> 00:01:09.166
Please. take care of him.

5
00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:21.541
{\an8}

6
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.416
Turn off the lights.

7
00:03:29.916 --> 00:03:31.250
{\an8}

8
00:03:31.333 --> 00:03:33.208
{\an8}-

9
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.333
Come on.

10
00:03:47.416 --> 00:03:48.416
Careful.

11
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.208
I think your girlfriend
wants sunglasses now.

12
00:06:59.291 --> 00:07:01.791
No? Sunglasses for the beautiful woman.

13
00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.666
Can you take care of Thanasis?

14
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.416
{\an8}

15
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.500
Please.

16
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.166
-Yes. of course.
-I need to go to hospital.

17
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:42.375
Okay.

18
00:08:41.833 --> 00:08:43.541
-Is he okay?
-Yes.

19
00:08:44.291 --> 00:08:46.375
He is healthy and all clean.

20
00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.125
He's perfect.

21
00:08:48.625 --> 00:08:51.458
Is there any way
to contact your husband. Veronica?

22
00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:55.000
Uh. he's working in Árgos.
There's no telephone.

23
00:08:55.083 --> 00:08:56.416
He's going to get a surprise.

24
00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.000
Yes. he will.

25
00:08:59.083 --> 00:09:03.708
I just need some more information for the.
uh. Universal Health Service paperwork.

26
00:09:03.791 --> 00:09:06.083
I can never remember it.

27
00:09:06.166 --> 00:09:09.083
It's okay.
I will take a copy of your residency card.

28
00:09:09.166 --> 00:09:12.083
It's at home.
I was at work when I went into labor.

29
00:09:14.291 --> 00:09:15.625
Okay.

30
00:09:19.666 --> 00:09:20.666
Here.

31
00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.541
How was your trip?

32
00:10:48.125 --> 00:10:49.125
Very long.

33
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.250
How have things been here?

34
00:10:55.416 --> 00:10:56.500
Oh. uneventful.

35
00:11:07.791 --> 00:11:08.791
Vera?

36
00:11:19.625 --> 00:11:22.208
You only have to think about
what's in front of you.

37
00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:25.500
Vera. I have another son.

38
00:11:38.083 --> 00:11:41.041
Thanasis Rotimi.
look at your baby brother.

39
00:11:41.625 --> 00:11:43.583
Look at your baby brother. Look.

40
00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.125
Friends come and go. but family's forever.

41
00:11:47.708 --> 00:11:48.791
You hear me?

42
00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:51.750
-Huh?
-You will never be alone.

43
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.416
What shall you call him?

44
00:12:01.541 --> 00:12:05.375
Giannis. In Greek. it means "John."
like the apostle.

45
00:12:06.333 --> 00:12:09.583
And Ugo in Ibo means "a crown."

46
00:12:10.583 --> 00:12:13.083
A crown that God has given.
nobody can take away.

47
00:12:13.166 --> 00:12:14.666
-Amen.
-Amen.

48
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:16.458
-Amen.
-Amen.

49
00:12:43.291 --> 00:12:45.250
Sorry. You misspelled our last name.

50
00:12:47.458 --> 00:12:50.375
-There's too many letters.
-"Antetokounmpo."

51
00:12:50.458 --> 00:12:51.958
Adetokunbo.

52
00:12:52.541 --> 00:12:54.541
Antetokounmpo?

53
00:12:54.625 --> 00:12:56.500
-Adetokunbo.
-Excuse me. Ms. Pantazis?

54
00:12:56.583 --> 00:12:57.833
Tell them I'll be a minute.

55
00:12:57.916 --> 00:13:01.208
Are you sure we got it wrong?
Our translators are usually very good.

56
00:13:03.333 --> 00:13:05.958
We know our own name. Ms. Pantazis.

57
00:13:06.041 --> 00:13:08.916
It's Adetokunbo.
It's a very proud Yoruba name.

58
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.125
It means "the king from across
the seas has returned."

59
00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:14.375
Okay. I'll make a note of it.

60
00:13:15.333 --> 00:13:18.166
Uh. did you bring your education history
and proof of current employment?

61
00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:19.250
Oh. yes.

62
00:13:19.333 --> 00:13:23.333
Uh. so. this is a letter
from the temp agency that gets us jobs.

63
00:13:30.833 --> 00:13:31.875
This isn't enough.

64
00:13:32.833 --> 00:13:35.875
You need to prove you're working legally.
on payroll.

65
00:13:36.875 --> 00:13:38.833
If you file
a residency application like this.

66
00:13:38.916 --> 00:13:42.416
it will be rejected on the basis
you entered Greece without permission.

67
00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.041
But we didn't choose to be illegal.

68
00:13:44.125 --> 00:13:47.875
Our passports were illegally confiscated
by the European police.

69
00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.750
We couldn't go back
because we had spent all of our savings.

70
00:13:50.833 --> 00:13:52.916
We had to cross the border.
You understand?

71
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:56.916
Now. our boys are Greek.

72
00:13:58.791 --> 00:14:00.750
They need the rights that go with that.

73
00:14:01.916 --> 00:14:03.833
Stay hidden while we work this out.

74
00:14:04.666 --> 00:14:05.750
Excuse me.

75
00:14:09.875 --> 00:14:11.375
Wait. Ms. Pantazis?

76
00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.750
The longer we stay hidden.
the more likely we get caught.

77
00:14:15.833 --> 00:14:17.916
We just want to do the right thing.

78
00:14:18.416 --> 00:14:19.958
You can file for asylum status.

79
00:14:20.041 --> 00:14:22.958
Asylum?
No. no. we are immigrants. not refugees.

80
00:14:24.458 --> 00:14:25.458
Hmm?

81
00:14:25.541 --> 00:14:27.250
There was no war where we came from.

82
00:14:27.333 --> 00:14:29.208
If there was. we'd be refugees.
but there wasn't.

83
00:14:29.291 --> 00:14:32.333
Then find legal work.
Stop using temp agencies.

84
00:14:32.916 --> 00:14:36.708
Find a job that puts you on payroll
and gets you a Social Security number.

85
00:14:36.791 --> 00:14:39.041
That will qualify you for a work permit.

86
00:14:39.125 --> 00:14:40.625
You can open a bank account.

87
00:14:40.708 --> 00:14:44.500
We can take all that and present
a strong residency application. hmm?

88
00:14:45.083 --> 00:14:46.125
Ms. Pantazis.

89
00:14:47.291 --> 00:14:51.208
no one will give us a payroll job
without legal residency.

90
00:14:51.708 --> 00:14:55.250
And no one will give us residency
without a payroll job.

91
00:15:08.916 --> 00:15:09.916
Okay…

92
00:15:11.708 --> 00:15:13.958
Maybe sunglasses.

93
00:15:16.625 --> 00:15:18.250
Watch your brother. eh?

94
00:15:21.583 --> 00:15:23.500
You're not buying for you. Gianni.

95
00:15:23.583 --> 00:15:26.250
I know.
but how will I know people will like it

96
00:15:26.333 --> 00:15:29.000
and want to buy it
if I don't like it first?

97
00:15:29.083 --> 00:15:30.875
You're absolutely right.

98
00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:33.833
You have to believe in what you sell.

99
00:15:34.541 --> 00:15:37.458
But how about you keep this one
for you. huh?

100
00:15:38.625 --> 00:15:40.458
We buy only what we can sell.

101
00:15:41.083 --> 00:15:44.041
Sunglasses are good. Watches and--

102
00:15:44.125 --> 00:15:48.875
Alex. Kostas.
these rosary beads sell very well.

103
00:15:51.625 --> 00:15:53.125
Hi. would you like a--

104
00:15:54.083 --> 00:15:55.250
Excuse me?

105
00:15:56.708 --> 00:15:58.000
Anyone? Anyone?

106
00:16:00.833 --> 00:16:02.000
All right.

107
00:16:06.083 --> 00:16:07.708
They won't stop for me.

108
00:16:07.791 --> 00:16:09.291
They won't even look at me.

109
00:16:09.375 --> 00:16:10.625
Let me teach you something.

110
00:16:10.708 --> 00:16:12.708
The direct approach
might not work for you.

111
00:16:12.791 --> 00:16:14.625
You're not as handsome as me.

112
00:16:14.708 --> 00:16:17.333
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
Trust your big brother.

113
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000
You can't accept no.

114
00:16:19.083 --> 00:16:20.375
No means maybe.

115
00:16:20.458 --> 00:16:22.208
You're not selling this.
You're selling you.

116
00:16:22.291 --> 00:16:25.000
You have to find out
what each person is interested in.

117
00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:28.416
My brother sells
the best sunglasses in Greece!

118
00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:34.250
Huh?

119
00:16:34.333 --> 00:16:37.125
For you. two euros. Just two euro.

120
00:16:37.791 --> 00:16:40.625
Alex. Kostas. stay closer.

121
00:16:49.625 --> 00:16:51.208
-Look at this.
-Where did you get all of this?

122
00:16:51.291 --> 00:16:53.000
-We sold all our stuff.
-All of it?

123
00:16:53.083 --> 00:16:54.791
-Yes.
-Where's your hat?

124
00:16:54.875 --> 00:16:57.333
-I sold that too.
-Oh. my goodness.

125
00:16:58.625 --> 00:16:59.875
Mama. police!

126
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.458
-Ugo. leave it.
-We can't leave all this!

127
00:17:09.541 --> 00:17:10.666
Rotimi. grab Kostas!

128
00:17:15.166 --> 00:17:16.375
Mom!

129
00:17:16.875 --> 00:17:18.458
Ugo! Rotimi!

130
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.750
-I am winning!

131
00:18:07.375 --> 00:18:09.375
Right. You click it now.

132
00:18:11.291 --> 00:18:13.791
Mama. I can't see! Thano's going to score!

133
00:18:13.875 --> 00:18:14.875
Sorry. Ugo.

134
00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:16.625
He's gonna score anyway.

135
00:18:20.541 --> 00:18:21.666
Over there!

136
00:18:27.666 --> 00:18:29.916
-My boys!
-Papa!

137
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
-Oh. yeah?
-Papa!

138
00:18:31.083 --> 00:18:33.166
Four to one! I will defeat you all.

139
00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:34.791
I will defeat you all.

140
00:18:34.875 --> 00:18:38.083
Oh. no! I grossly misjudged the situation.

141
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.000
Okay. let me go and say hello
and goodbye to Mommy.

142
00:18:44.875 --> 00:18:46.333
-Oh! Ow.

143
00:18:46.416 --> 00:18:48.583
-I need the ball! Now!
-Mommy.

144
00:18:48.666 --> 00:18:49.666
Oh. no.

145
00:18:50.791 --> 00:18:52.500
You bought a soccer ball?

146
00:18:52.583 --> 00:18:53.875
Eh. the old one burst.

147
00:18:56.333 --> 00:18:58.125
I need to buy groceries.

148
00:18:58.208 --> 00:18:59.541
We also have to pay rent.

149
00:18:59.625 --> 00:19:00.875
Bamidele wants it today.

150
00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:03.041
Ah. Don't worry. I didn't spend too much.

151
00:19:05.125 --> 00:19:06.291
I promise.

152
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.500
Are you going to tell them
they can't have it? Hmm?

153
00:19:12.583 --> 00:19:14.958
-Pass it.
-Pass it. Pass it! Pass it!

154
00:19:15.041 --> 00:19:16.750
-Pass it!

155
00:19:17.791 --> 00:19:19.083
Pass it! Pass it!

156
00:19:19.166 --> 00:19:21.666
-I'll shop smart. We'll be okay.
-Pass to me! Pass to me!

157
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:22.750
Okay.

158
00:19:22.833 --> 00:19:24.666
I have to go to work now. I'll be late.

159
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:25.750
Uh-uh.

160
00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:29.125
-I'll miss you.
-Pass to me. Pass it to me.

161
00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.375
-Ow!
-No ball in the house. Kostas.

162
00:19:33.458 --> 00:19:36.250
I made plantain and yam for the boys.

163
00:19:36.333 --> 00:19:37.333

See? Should've listened to your coach.
Huh?

174
00:20:07.875 --> 00:20:09.000
I could have scored!

175
00:20:09.916 --> 00:20:13.250
Is it called Thanasis-ball?
You have a whole team! Huh?

176
00:20:13.333 --> 00:20:15.083
Ugo was in a better position to score.

177
00:20:15.166 --> 00:20:16.166
Right?

178
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:19.625
If one man scores. the whole team scores.

212
00:22:12.333 --> 00:22:15.583
Gianni. you got to keep bouncing it. bro.

Mm-hmm.

215
00:22:18.625 --> 00:22:19.625
Okay.

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:23.250
Hey. hey. hey.

219
00:22:30.041 --> 00:22:31.250

Youth club. It's free.

227
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000

Okay.

230

Welcome back to
the top ten African basketball players.

231
00:23:30.791 --> 00:23:34.208
And at number two from Cameroon
and now living and playing in Greece.

232
00:23:34.291 --> 00:23:37.875
Sofoklis Schortsanitis.
known as Baby Shaq.

233
00:23:37.958 --> 00:23:39.708
-Whoa.

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:46.041
{\an8}Man. he's like.
"Is somebody here the Hulk of basketball?"

235
00:23:48.416 --> 00:23:52.291
{\an8}And at number one is
the first pick of the 1984 NBA Draft.

236
00:23:52.375 --> 00:23:54.833
{\an8}Hakeem Olajuwon from Nigeria.

237
00:23:54.916 --> 00:23:58.791
He was a soccer player and didn't start
playing basketball till five years ago.

238
00:23:58.875 --> 00:24:00.458
Look at the footwork from Olajuwon.

239
00:24:00.541 --> 00:24:02.833
Fake. baseline and he scores.

240
00:24:02.916 --> 00:24:05.625
Hakeem the Dream. what a move!

241
00:24:05.708 --> 00:24:08.166
-Oya. boys. Time for bed.
-If he was the only player on the court.

242
00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:09.791
I could watch him play all night--

243
00:24:10.375 --> 00:24:14.208
Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
those who trespass against us.

244
00:24:14.291 --> 00:24:17.958
Lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

245
00:24:18.041 --> 00:24:19.041
Amen.

246
00:24:21.625 --> 00:24:23.250
And you.

247
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:25.291
And you.

248
00:24:26.208 --> 00:24:27.750
And you.

-Good night. Ma!
-Good night. Ma.

252
00:24:41.916 --> 00:24:43.083
I wanna play again.

253
00:24:43.166 --> 00:24:44.500
You couldn't even bounce the ball.

254
00:24:44.583 --> 00:24:46.458
-Ooh!

255
00:24:46.541 --> 00:24:47.625
And how would you know?

256
00:24:47.708 --> 00:24:50.666
Every time I looked over there. you were
stuffing your face with plantains.

257
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:53.750
-Ooh. true.
-We could see you.

258
00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:56.166
The ball kept rolling through your legs.

259
00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:58.666
Well. you saw they didn't get the ball.
did they?

260
00:24:59.958 --> 00:25:01.875
-Yo.
-It's called defense.

261
00:25:05.458 --> 00:25:07.916
Filathlitikos
is one hour. 20 minutes away.

262
00:25:08.791 --> 00:25:11.791
We'll have to ride to get the bus.
then change to the Metro.

263
00:25:11.875 --> 00:25:14.291
I don't know. Papa won't like that.

264
00:25:14.375 --> 00:25:16.125
And who's going to tell him?

265
00:25:17.875 --> 00:25:19.791
-Why are you looking at me?

266
00:25:20.666 --> 00:25:24.541
Listen. go after school tomorrow.
Get home before he's back from work.

267
00:25:24.625 --> 00:25:27.291
Yeah. and we can get back home
before he even knows what happened.

268
00:25:27.375 --> 00:25:29.583
And I'll come
to make sure you get there safely.

269
00:25:29.666 --> 00:25:31.708
No. bro. Too little.

270
00:25:32.958 --> 00:25:33.958
I'm growing.

271
00:25:34.041 --> 00:25:37.208
Listen.
since this is a top-secret mission.

272
00:25:38.416 --> 00:25:40.708
me and Gianni have to scope it out first.

273
00:25:40.791 --> 00:25:43.208
If it's safe. maybe we'll take you.

274
00:25:43.291 --> 00:25:44.416
Maybe?

275
00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:45.791
I just grew.

276
00:25:45.875 --> 00:25:47.791
It'll change to "maybe not"
if you don't go to sleep now.

277
00:25:47.875 --> 00:25:49.375
-I grew more!
-Sleep.

278
00:25:50.541 --> 00:25:52.791
You too. Sleep.

279
00:26:00.833 --> 00:26:04.708
Listen.
Papa always talks about opportunity.

280
00:26:05.375 --> 00:26:06.583
What if this is it?

281
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:09.208
The boy said it's a big club.

282
00:26:10.333 --> 00:26:13.375
If we're good.
maybe they pick us for their team.

283
00:26:13.958 --> 00:26:15.666
Basketball players can make money.

284
00:26:16.625 --> 00:26:18.208
We can help Mom and Dad.

285
00:26:18.708 --> 00:26:21.166
-You think you're that good already?

286
00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:23.958
If it's to help our family.
I will get that good.

287
00:27:03.875 --> 00:27:06.166

293
00:28:15.541 --> 00:28:16.541
They're tall.

294
00:28:25.875 --> 00:28:28.000
What-- What are you guys doing here?

295
00:28:30.166 --> 00:28:35.166

297
00:28:42.208 --> 00:28:44.208
Do your parents know that you're here?

298
00:28:44.708 --> 00:28:47.083
Uh… Our mom dropped us off.

299
00:28:47.166 --> 00:28:50.291
She'll be back later.
She wanted us to do the-- the free--

300
00:28:50.375 --> 00:28:52.041
The free youth club. Yeah. I heard that.

301
00:28:52.125 --> 00:28:54.875
But we're gonna need her signature
before you can play.

302
00:28:54.958 --> 00:28:57.583
But she doesn't know we're here.

303
00:28:57.666 --> 00:28:59.833
Gianni. Man.

304
00:29:02.708 --> 00:29:04.958

Wait here.

00:31:53.458 --> 00:31:55.958
Papa. the coach gave us this.

352
00:31:57.208 --> 00:32:00.625
They said if you sign this.
we can play every day after school.

353
00:32:04.375 --> 00:32:05.875
What if they had reported you?

354
00:32:07.208 --> 00:32:09.375
You disobeyed your father
and took your younger brother with you.

355
00:32:09.458 --> 00:32:11.291
-Papa. wait--
-We did it together. Papa.

356
00:32:11.375 --> 00:32:14.000
If we were in Nigeria.
you both would've been beyond grounded…

357
00:32:14.083 --> 00:32:15.833
-Papa…
-…for a week.

358
00:32:15.916 --> 00:32:17.250
Mama?

359
00:32:24.875 --> 00:32:26.708
My friend. leave that basketball.

360
00:32:35.791 --> 00:32:37.625
Let their punishment be a lesson. eh?

361
00:32:37.708 --> 00:32:39.750
Promise me never to disobey your parents.

362
00:32:39.833 --> 00:32:41.708
-We promise.
-Good.

363
00:32:50.166 --> 00:32:51.166
Can you imagine?

364
00:32:55.958 --> 00:32:57.458
These boys are gonna kill me.

365
00:33:04.166 --> 00:33:07.625
Why are you reacting so crazy?
It's just a couple of hours after school.

366
00:33:08.708 --> 00:33:11.000
When they are at school.
I know where they are. okay?

367
00:33:11.083 --> 00:33:12.541
They come home. they're with us.

368
00:33:12.625 --> 00:33:14.166
We sell. we sell together.

369
00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:16.583
Okay.
this is only going to jeopardize that

370
00:33:16.666 --> 00:33:18.333
and distract them
from getting an education.

371
00:33:18.416 --> 00:33:21.250
Shebi. we always said we wanted to protect
their childhood.

372
00:33:21.333 --> 00:33:24.333
With coaches we don't know
giving us papers to sign. eh?

373
00:33:24.416 --> 00:33:26.833
-Now strangers watching them play?

374
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000
Don't you remember
when you used to play football?

375
00:33:35.833 --> 00:33:37.833
We should let them play.

376
00:33:37.916 --> 00:33:39.625
They need to have fun
like normal children.

377
00:33:39.708 --> 00:33:41.833
Vera. we cannot take this risk
until we are all safe.

378
00:33:41.916 --> 00:33:43.666
I'm trying to keep this family together.

379
00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:47.833
I think about all of us too.

380
00:33:49.541 --> 00:33:50.541
All of the time.

381
00:33:55.041 --> 00:33:56.041
Vera. I'm sorry.

382
00:33:59.875 --> 00:34:00.875
Vera…

383
00:34:06.958 --> 00:34:07.958
I'm sorry.

384
00:34:09.416 --> 00:34:10.416

Charles…

447
00:37:25.333 --> 00:37:28.166
I thought they gave us an extension
to the end of the month.

448
00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:29.250
There's no water?

449
00:37:39.166 --> 00:37:40.416
I'll call the water company.

450
00:38:27.708 --> 00:38:29.625

453
00:38:40.041 --> 00:38:41.208
Easy. Take it!

454
00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:44.500
Bravo!

455
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:48.750
Thano!

456
00:39:20.875 --> 00:39:23.333
He has put in a lot of effort. huh?

457
00:39:26.125 --> 00:39:27.625
So what do you want for them?

458
00:39:28.208 --> 00:39:32.083
I. uh… I want them to be
the best they can be.

459
00:39:32.708 --> 00:39:34.708
Thanasis could play in the A-league.

460
00:39:34.791 --> 00:39:36.708
Teams are asking about him already.

461
00:39:36.791 --> 00:39:38.458
The national team maybe…

462
00:39:39.875 --> 00:39:40.875
National team?

463
00:39:40.958 --> 00:39:43.791
Yeah. why not?
Who knows where he'll end up?

464
00:39:44.666 --> 00:39:47.041
And Giannis. uh…

465
00:39:47.625 --> 00:39:48.625
He's getting better.

466
00:39:53.583 --> 00:39:55.333
Takis. I know how this game is played.

467
00:39:55.416 --> 00:39:57.250
Football. basketball. it's all the same.

468
00:39:57.333 --> 00:39:58.333
Mmm.

469
00:39:58.416 --> 00:40:00.166
If you want to go pro. you start young.

470
00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:02.250
and you hope the gods
are smiling down on you.

471
00:40:04.666 --> 00:40:06.041
And they don't often smile.

472
00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:09.541
And if they do.
our family will be exposed.

473
00:40:17.708 --> 00:40:18.958
Way to go. Gianni!

474
00:40:38.125 --> 00:40:39.458
Feeling good today.

475
00:40:43.083 --> 00:40:44.500
Look at them. Lookit.

476
00:40:48.541 --> 00:40:51.083
Hey. Show them who we are.

477
00:40:51.166 --> 00:40:52.291
Who wants this more. eh?

478
00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:10.250
That's an advance for my signature.

479
00:41:10.958 --> 00:41:13.541
Panarios. another C-League basketball club
here in Athens.

480
00:41:13.625 --> 00:41:15.875
they saw Thanasis play. spoke to Takis.

481
00:41:15.958 --> 00:41:18.291
They want him to switch clubs
and play for their men's team.

482
00:41:18.375 --> 00:41:19.916
Is-- Is Takis okay with this?

483
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.416
No. he wants me to stay.
But he says it's our choice.

484
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:24.875
He knows we need the money.

485
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:28.041
I told him I'm taking it for us.

486
00:41:30.041 --> 00:41:31.916
I'm so proud of you. Rotimi.

487
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.208

Takis says the club found out
about our status and withdrew the offer.

519
00:43:30.833 --> 00:43:33.500

I'm okay.

522

525
00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:35.750
But they can't stop us
from getting back up.

526
00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:11.666
National news now.

527
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:14.625
Entry into Greece
remains the preferred path

528
00:45:14.708 --> 00:45:20.458
for thousands of refugees escaping war.
trying to find safety in the EU.

529
00:45:20.958 --> 00:45:25.666
The Greek government is unable to curb
the flow of these illegal immigrants.

530
00:45:26.166 --> 00:45:29.041
It has led to a rise
in anti-immigrant protests.

531
00:45:29.125 --> 00:45:31.083
and violence directed towards them.

532
00:45:31.833 --> 00:45:34.833
The government is now convening
a special council to decide--

533
00:46:39.666 --> 00:46:41.583
I was going to do that.

534
00:46:43.708 --> 00:46:44.708
I can help you.

535
00:46:48.583 --> 00:46:49.583
It's okay.

536
00:47:02.291 --> 00:47:03.958
Why did you leave Francis behind?

537
00:47:15.708 --> 00:47:17.375
He was too young for the journey.

538
00:47:22.458 --> 00:47:26.708
It was one of the most difficult decisions
of my life.

539
00:47:29.958 --> 00:47:32.375
I'm still not sure
if we did the right thing.

540
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.500
We wanted to go to Greece
in search of a better life.

541
00:47:40.083 --> 00:47:42.791
but we couldn't get
our Greek visa in Nigeria.

542
00:47:45.208 --> 00:47:47.000
So we had to find another way.

543
00:47:49.875 --> 00:47:51.708
But it took many years.

544
00:47:54.625 --> 00:47:56.375
By then. Francis had been born.

545
00:48:01.125 --> 00:48:03.625
Your father and I
spent many weeks discussing it.

546
00:48:05.333 --> 00:48:10.625
We couldn't take Francis because we'd
heard stories about the European police

547
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:15.291
treating even legal African travelers
like they were criminals.

548
00:48:18.958 --> 00:48:20.958
The journey would've been too dangerous.

549
00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:25.583
So we made our choice…

550
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.708
to leave him where it was safe.

551
00:48:34.458 --> 00:48:35.708
To bring him over…

552
00:48:38.083 --> 00:48:40.458
as soon as we were settled in Greece.

553
00:48:48.291 --> 00:48:49.750
We stick together.

554
00:48:54.458 --> 00:48:58.458
But sometimes we need to sacrifice
for the family.

555
00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:01.875
Don't cry. Mama.

556
00:49:04.708 --> 00:49:06.833
Everything will be okay one day.

557
00:49:06.916 --> 00:49:08.416
I promise.

558
00:49:14.041 --> 00:49:16.125
God makes no mistakes.

559
00:49:34.041 --> 00:49:36.375
Give it your all.

560
00:49:39.416 --> 00:49:41.375
And then let God do his work.

561
00:50:19.375 --> 00:50:20.958
Charles Adetokunbo with the ball.

562
00:50:21.458 --> 00:50:22.458
He fires.

563
00:50:22.541 --> 00:50:28.333
Oh! It's a goal! It's a goal!

564
00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:32.750
The mathematical Charles Adetokunbo
just scored again.

565
00:50:34.166 --> 00:50:35.583
Charles the man.

566
00:50:36.458 --> 00:50:38.125
-He did it.

567
00:50:38.208 --> 00:50:39.250
He did it!

568
00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:12.791
Thunder now to inbound. Up five.

569
00:51:13.666 --> 00:51:16.583
Trying to work the ball inside.
Nothing there.

570
00:51:17.875 --> 00:51:20.250
The dish off the down screen to Durant.

571
00:51:22.166 --> 00:51:24.375
And he hits it.

572
00:51:28.166 --> 00:51:29.791
{\an8}I got this for you boys. huh?

573
00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:32.750
Since you wore out
the pair you were sharing.

574
00:51:36.166 --> 00:51:37.166
Thank you. Papa.

575
00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:38.458
Ah.

576
00:51:43.083 --> 00:51:44.083
You worked hard.

577
00:51:44.791 --> 00:51:45.791
Hmm.

578
00:51:46.708 --> 00:51:48.166
You've shown commitment.

579
00:51:50.333 --> 00:51:51.333
You earned it.

580
00:51:53.166 --> 00:51:54.500
-Let's go break them in.

581
00:51:54.583 --> 00:51:55.875
Let's go.

582
00:51:55.958 --> 00:51:57.541
Uh-uh. In this rain?

583
00:51:58.208 --> 00:51:59.208
Yes.

584
00:52:01.625 --> 00:52:03.625
Four. three. two--

585
00:52:04.916 --> 00:52:06.416
It's okay. We'll go again.

586
00:52:12.375 --> 00:52:13.375
Chin up. huh?

587
00:52:24.541 --> 00:52:26.791
That's why we fall.
We fall to get back up.

588
00:52:37.875 --> 00:52:40.875
It's okay. It's okay.
Shake it off. huh? Come back.

589
00:52:41.458 --> 00:52:43.958
It's not where you start.
It's where you finish.

590
00:52:46.583 --> 00:52:48.291
The company has put me on the payroll.

591
00:52:48.375 --> 00:52:50.083
They're sending me checks every week.

592
00:52:50.166 --> 00:52:52.666
And they're making
Social Security contributions.

593
00:52:52.750 --> 00:52:56.916
Which I can't claim until I'm legal.
but. uh…

594
00:53:00.125 --> 00:53:03.916
This qualifies for work permit. right?

595
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.416
You're a janitor?

596
00:53:06.875 --> 00:53:08.166
Yes. I'm the janitor.

597
00:53:14.791 --> 00:53:17.625
This isn't something we can build
a residency application from.

598
00:53:19.708 --> 00:53:21.333
You said "payroll job."

599
00:53:21.416 --> 00:53:22.750
I meant a real job.

600
00:53:24.083 --> 00:53:26.250
Ms. Pantazis. this is a real job.

601
00:53:26.875 --> 00:53:28.750
Something that requires skill.

602
00:53:29.458 --> 00:53:30.791
I thought it'd be obvious.

603
00:53:31.458 --> 00:53:32.458
Skill?

604
00:53:34.541 --> 00:53:39.583
I'm sorry. Ms. Pantazis.
What exactly is it you do here?

605
00:53:41.083 --> 00:53:42.375
You sit there and-- and you--

606
00:53:42.458 --> 00:53:45.000
y-you give us advice.
and nothing ever gets done.

607
00:53:53.166 --> 00:53:58.291
The government is never going
to give us residency. are they?

608
00:53:58.375 --> 00:54:00.291
They are more concerned
with keeping people out.

609
00:54:05.791 --> 00:54:06.875
Keeping people out.

610
00:54:10.458 --> 00:54:15.000
Ms. Pantazis. did you know that the Greek
civilization has its roots in Africa?

611
00:54:16.083 --> 00:54:17.083
Oh. yes.

612
00:54:17.166 --> 00:54:21.333
Zeus and Shango.
the Yoruba God of lightning and thunder…

613
00:54:23.166 --> 00:54:24.166
they are the same.

614
00:54:24.791 --> 00:54:28.458
We can't mess this up or you'll end up
on the government's radar and deported.

615
00:55:10.333 --> 00:55:13.625
Giannis. you're starting today.
I need you to step up.

616
00:55:37.625 --> 00:55:39.166
Pass. pass. pass!

617
00:55:39.833 --> 00:55:41.458
Hey. move! Easy.

618
00:55:42.375 --> 00:55:43.666
Come on. man.

619
00:55:47.625 --> 00:55:49.000
Pressure. Pressure.

620
00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:51.208
Hands. Gianni! Hands!

621
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.166
Hands!

622
00:55:54.708 --> 00:55:56.333
Man. man.

623
00:56:03.541 --> 00:56:04.583
Gianni.

624
00:56:08.041 --> 00:56:09.541
Give it up. blackie. You suck.

625
00:56:30.291 --> 00:56:31.291
Chairman.

626
00:56:44.458 --> 00:56:45.458
-Papa.
-Hmm?

627
00:56:49.458 --> 00:56:50.875
Why do they hate us so much?

628
00:56:59.958 --> 00:57:01.333
Ugo. racists are ignorant.

629
00:57:04.291 --> 00:57:06.375
Afraid of anything and anybody different.

630
00:57:09.333 --> 00:57:11.916
Son.
this country has given us free education.

631
00:57:12.625 --> 00:57:13.625
Hmm?

632
00:57:13.708 --> 00:57:15.250
Jobs. Freedom.

633
00:57:16.875 --> 00:57:18.625
The rest we'll sort out for ourselves.

634
00:57:20.791 --> 00:57:21.791
-Okay?

635
00:57:26.250 --> 00:57:28.291
Did he make a miraculous shot? Yes.

636
00:57:28.375 --> 00:57:30.750
Has he ever done it before?
You bet he has.

637
00:57:30.833 --> 00:57:33.625
Will he ever do it again?
Time and time again.

638
00:58:35.916 --> 00:58:38.750
-Now. we'll get the rest to you next week.
-No.

639
00:58:38.833 --> 00:58:42.083
{\an8}

640
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:45.208
Shebi work has been slow.

641
00:58:45.708 --> 00:58:49.041
Or you been spending all your money
on your boys' basketball.

642
00:58:50.208 --> 00:58:54.208
I get plenty people who will want take
this place from you. and they pay on time.

643
00:59:10.708 --> 00:59:14.875
Is that you?
Huh? Huh?

644
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:22.000
Okay. I know that face.

645
00:59:22.875 --> 00:59:23.875
Don't say one word.

646
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:28.291
-I can explain.

647
00:59:28.375 --> 00:59:31.000
Okay. Stavros's cousin owns a garage.

648
00:59:31.083 --> 00:59:33.000
Okay. it just need a new battery.

649
00:59:33.083 --> 00:59:35.791
Brake pads. oil change. carburetor. Hmm?

650
00:59:37.375 --> 00:59:39.041
-I fixed it.

651
00:59:40.041 --> 00:59:43.708
We can't afford to buy a new car.
We need to pay this month's rent.

652
00:59:44.791 --> 00:59:47.541
Vera. listen to me.
We only have 500 euros.

653
00:59:47.625 --> 00:59:48.500
Uh-huh.

654
00:59:48.583 --> 00:59:51.541
But with a car.
we can go out of town. huh?

655
00:59:52.375 --> 00:59:53.458
Sell to tourists.

656
00:59:54.625 --> 00:59:57.083
We'll be the only ones there. huh?

657
01:00:01.291 --> 01:00:02.958
Why don't you take me for a ride?

658
01:00:20.458 --> 01:00:21.458
Yeah.

659
01:00:31.833 --> 01:00:33.791
Well. at least he can hit a jumper now.

660
01:00:35.416 --> 01:00:36.416
All right.

661
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.583
We're gonna be good this year.

662
01:00:42.833 --> 01:00:43.875
Good.

663
01:00:48.333 --> 01:00:49.416
Thano!

664
01:00:51.625 --> 01:00:53.458
-All right! Go.

665
01:00:55.791 --> 01:00:56.875
Watch out! Good!

666
01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.416
Thano. bud. go!

667
01:01:05.125 --> 01:01:06.916
Thano. keep your feet light.

668
01:01:10.291 --> 01:01:12.791
All right! That's why we're working

01:01:12.875 --> 01:01:13.875
That's why we working.

670
01:01:14.916 --> 01:01:16.791
Thanasis is a star.

01:01:17.375 --> 01:01:21.541
Yeah. Good. good. good. good.
Go. Go. go. go. Nice.

672
01:01:21.625 --> 01:01:25.333
Hands! Hands! Hands!

673
01:01:26.666 --> 01:01:28.541
-Hands!

Block it!

675
01:01:31.541 --> 01:01:33.166
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

676
01:01:34.916 --> 01:01:36.083

677
01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:44.375
-Yes!

Go!

679
01:01:46.458 --> 01:01:47.458
Yes!

680
01:01:48.666 --> 01:01:50.041
He has potential.

681
01:01:51.083 --> 01:01:52.583
Pressure. Giannis. pressure!

682
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.333
Go. go. go. go.

683
01:02:07.791 --> 01:02:09.625
He's leading the whole team.

684
01:02:09.708 --> 01:02:11.916
Go. go. Come on. Two.

685
01:02:17.875 --> 01:02:20.708
You guys were hitting the ball.
now this happens. Okay?

686
01:02:20.791 --> 01:02:22.666
Watch a little bit what's going on!

687
01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:25.958
-Calm down.
-Calm down? You calm down!

688
01:02:26.041 --> 01:02:27.875
It's okay. It's okay.

689
01:02:32.833 --> 01:02:34.250
Are you okay? Are you--

690
01:02:34.333 --> 01:02:35.458
Stop. stop. stop. stop.

691
01:02:35.541 --> 01:02:36.541
It's okay.

692
01:02:38.375 --> 01:02:39.958
-Easy.

693
01:02:54.666 --> 01:02:56.666
Gianni. Go.

694
01:02:58.083 --> 01:02:59.291
This is your chance.

695
01:03:01.333 --> 01:03:02.333

01:04:27.791 --> 01:04:29.875
And still. they have room to grow.

708
01:04:30.666 --> 01:04:32.791
No GM's gonna take it seriously.

709
01:04:32.875 --> 01:04:35.583
These guys are never gonna be able
to play legally in the A-League.

710
01:04:35.666 --> 01:04:38.083
-They don't have papers.
-You can get them papers.

711
01:04:39.125 --> 01:04:42.208
Look. I said I'd come as a favor
to Mr. Gianakos. and I did. Okay?

712
01:04:42.708 --> 01:04:44.416
They're illegal immigrants. Haris.

713
01:04:45.458 --> 01:04:49.000
Teams will get fined for signing them.
and they'll get sent back

714
01:04:49.083 --> 01:04:51.875
to wherever they came from
the moment it's public.

715
01:04:51.958 --> 01:04:53.083
They were born here.

716
01:04:55.166 --> 01:04:56.458
You don't say.

717
01:05:01.291 --> 01:05:03.541
Hi. I'm Haris Eleftheriou.

718
01:05:03.625 --> 01:05:08.291
That's Haris with one R.

719
01:05:08.916 --> 01:05:12.416
And Eleftheriou also one R.

720
01:05:14.208 --> 01:05:17.375
We scout players from the lower leagues
to the A-League.

721
01:05:18.375 --> 01:05:22.750
Very few are good enough.
but Giannis was incredible today.

722
01:05:22.833 --> 01:05:24.541
He has really turned the team around.

723
01:05:25.041 --> 01:05:27.083
Your friend didn't seem to think so.

724
01:05:27.166 --> 01:05:28.958
-Paco?
-Mmm.

725
01:05:29.041 --> 01:05:30.333
He's not my friend.

726
01:05:30.416 --> 01:05:34.041
H-He is one of the most powerful
general scouts in the league.

727
01:05:34.125 --> 01:05:38.416
He can influence anybody and get
any A-League team to pick up a player.

728
01:05:39.083 --> 01:05:40.291
But he is not my friend.

729
01:05:41.250 --> 01:05:46.041
If you think he's good.
why don't you call the teams yourself?

730
01:05:47.041 --> 01:05:49.166
I'd have to rep them first.

731
01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:51.583
Excuse us. Haris.

732
01:05:56.875 --> 01:05:58.166
Boys!

733
01:05:58.875 --> 01:06:00.375
Oya. Sorry. sorry. sorry.

734
01:06:07.791 --> 01:06:08.875
Sports agent.

735
01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:16.500
Hmm?

736
01:06:22.833 --> 01:06:25.250
So. you want to be my agent?

737
01:06:26.625 --> 01:06:27.625
If you'd have me.

738
01:06:31.541 --> 01:06:32.541
Cool.

739
01:06:35.583 --> 01:06:36.583
Thank you.

740
01:06:37.208 --> 01:06:39.208
You won't regret this. I promise you.

741
01:06:39.291 --> 01:06:41.125
I-I will break my back for you.

742
01:06:41.625 --> 01:06:43.541
I'm going to start making calls
right away.

743
01:06:44.666 --> 01:06:47.791
Hey. um. h-how many clients do you have?

744
01:06:48.375 --> 01:06:49.375
You're the first.

745
01:07:22.125 --> 01:07:23.208
Those are selling out.

746
01:07:23.291 --> 01:07:24.750
-Oh. yes.

747
01:07:55.375 --> 01:07:56.958
-How far?
-It's not working.

748
01:07:57.041 --> 01:07:58.041
Eh?

749
01:07:59.333 --> 01:08:00.333
Let me see.

750
01:09:06.541 --> 01:09:07.958
You could have called us.

751
01:09:08.041 --> 01:09:11.625
{\an8}Uh-uh.

752
01:09:11.708 --> 01:09:14.000
-We live here.
-Oh. yeah? Pay the rent.

753
01:09:16.791 --> 01:09:21.208
This is back rent.
this month's rent and next month's rent.

754
01:09:24.166 --> 01:09:27.875
Bamidele. look at those boys.
They should be in bed.

755
01:09:28.625 --> 01:09:29.750
You pull this again…

756
01:09:32.041 --> 01:09:33.291
I will not be as civil.

757
01:09:33.375 --> 01:09:36.166
Next time. I will call the police.

758
01:09:36.875 --> 01:09:38.958
They'll handle you. All of you.

759
01:09:40.625 --> 01:09:41.625
My key.

760
01:09:49.375 --> 01:09:50.500
All the teams said no?

761
01:09:51.125 --> 01:09:52.375
Paco was right.

762
01:09:52.458 --> 01:09:54.875
Nobody wants to take the risk
on undocumented players.

763
01:09:56.208 --> 01:09:59.416
But there is a regional tryout
we can sign them up for.

764
01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:03.125
There will be major teams there
and scouts from European teams.

765
01:10:03.208 --> 01:10:05.666
I can't try out like this.

766
01:10:09.625 --> 01:10:11.000
But Gianni can do it.

767
01:10:11.833 --> 01:10:14.541
European teams means international stage.

768
01:10:16.208 --> 01:10:17.833
Everybody will see you.

769
01:10:22.041 --> 01:10:23.375
I guess this is it.

770
01:10:25.291 --> 01:10:29.833
But if we want the prize.
we're going to have to take the risk.

771
01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:32.791
Are you sure?

772
01:10:35.916 --> 01:10:37.583
You know I had a dream once too?

773
01:10:41.791 --> 01:10:43.416
But it wasn't meant to be.

774
01:10:49.333 --> 01:10:51.000
I'm going to do everything I can

775
01:10:51.791 --> 01:10:54.125
to make sure you have a fair chance
at your dream.

776
01:11:18.083 --> 01:11:19.083
Okay.

777
01:11:46.750 --> 01:11:49.541

Yeah!

792
01:13:09.333 --> 01:13:10.583
Defense! Defense!

793
01:13:11.416 --> 01:13:13.416
Crossover dribble. Come on.

794
01:13:18.583 --> 01:13:19.750
We're on the last play!

795
01:13:19.833 --> 01:13:20.833
I can't watch.

796
01:13:22.208 --> 01:13:23.916
I'm going to wait outside.

797
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.125
Come and get me after.

798
01:13:46.875 --> 01:13:48.208
Come on. Gianni.

799
01:13:48.791 --> 01:13:50.083
Yes. yes. yes. yes. yes!

800
01:13:51.791 --> 01:13:53.041
No.

801
01:13:59.625 --> 01:14:01.666
Shoot it now. Shoot it.

802
01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:22.791
Papa!

803
01:14:28.458 --> 01:14:30.083
What happened? Is he okay?

804
01:14:30.166 --> 01:14:31.875
He did it. Papa.

805
01:14:31.958 --> 01:14:33.291
He dominated.

806
01:14:33.375 --> 01:14:34.875
He was amazing.

807
01:15:06.666 --> 01:15:09.958
We have one offer.
but it's a little complicated.

808
01:15:10.041 --> 01:15:12.375
It's always complicated.

809
01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:15.208
Basket Zaragoza wants to sign him.

810
01:15:15.833 --> 01:15:17.666
Zaragoza? In Spain?

811
01:15:18.166 --> 01:15:21.083
The Greek clubs are still a bit
worried about his lack of papers.

812
01:15:21.166 --> 01:15:23.750
The Spanish.
they are more business-minded.

813
01:15:24.333 --> 01:15:26.333
They are willing to take the risk.

814
01:15:26.833 --> 01:15:29.541
Haris. how on earth
are we supposed to move to Spain?

815
01:15:29.625 --> 01:15:31.208
We're not even supposed to be in Greece.

816
01:15:31.291 --> 01:15:35.000
They'll secure a Spanish visa for Giannis.
so he can relocate to Spain.

817
01:15:35.083 --> 01:15:39.625
Also. they'll make a 10% advance
on a contract so you can have some money.

818
01:15:40.250 --> 01:15:43.375
What about my family?
Will they get visas too?

819
01:15:46.583 --> 01:15:48.833
Uh. I can try to negotiate it.

820
01:15:49.333 --> 01:15:51.166
We have to all be together.

821
01:15:52.458 --> 01:15:54.166
I will not leave my family behind.

822
01:15:58.375 --> 01:15:59.375
Okay.

823
01:16:11.583 --> 01:16:13.416
How long should it take him
to convince them?

824
01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:15.375
It will happen when it happens.

825
01:16:17.375 --> 01:16:18.375
Ugo.

826
01:16:30.208 --> 01:16:31.208
Mr. Adetokunbo.

827
01:16:33.375 --> 01:16:34.375
How can I help you?

828
01:16:36.916 --> 01:16:39.458
It's 5.000 euros just for you.

829
01:16:40.291 --> 01:16:41.500
No questions asked.

830
01:16:43.166 --> 01:16:44.916
I can also get you Greek passports.

831
01:16:47.125 --> 01:16:50.000
All I need is for Giannis
to come with us to the office.

832
01:16:50.083 --> 01:16:53.791
talk to a couple of major Greek teams
I got lined up just for him

833
01:16:53.875 --> 01:16:55.708
and forget about Spain.

834
01:16:56.750 --> 01:16:58.791
What about Haris? Our agent?

835
01:17:01.041 --> 01:17:02.416
We don't trust him.

836
01:17:03.291 --> 01:17:04.541
Neither should you.

837
01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:09.958
Look. Zaragoza has already made
their final offer.

838
01:17:11.375 --> 01:17:13.083
They're not taking your family.

839
01:17:13.166 --> 01:17:14.416
Haris is on the way.

840
01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:17.583
and he's gonna bring you that deal
and try to get you to take it.

841
01:17:17.666 --> 01:17:18.875
How do you know that?

842
01:17:19.791 --> 01:17:24.750
Because I'm the number one scout in
this country. and I have eyes everywhere.

843
01:17:26.458 --> 01:17:28.041
I made a mistake with you.

844
01:17:28.875 --> 01:17:30.041
and I'm here to fix that.

845
01:17:30.958 --> 01:17:32.291
You're good.

846
01:17:32.375 --> 01:17:36.875
Giannis. you're very good.
but Zaragoza will not make you great.

847
01:17:37.875 --> 01:17:39.291
I will.

848
01:17:42.041 --> 01:17:45.041
This will guarantee your residency.

849
01:17:57.666 --> 01:17:59.750
Playing in Greece keeps
the family together.

850
01:17:59.833 --> 01:18:00.875
It makes sense.

851
01:18:01.541 --> 01:18:03.000
Haris has to be part of the deal.

852
01:18:03.083 --> 01:18:05.000
You heard him. They aren't gonna
make a deal with Haris.

853
01:18:05.083 --> 01:18:06.541
But we don't even know this guy.

854
01:18:07.416 --> 01:18:08.416
Mama.

855
01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:09.791
He's right.

856
01:18:09.875 --> 01:18:11.500
I don't trust him either.

857
01:18:12.875 --> 01:18:15.791
We can't just abandon people
who've worked so hard for us.

858
01:18:48.416 --> 01:18:49.666
Thank you for your offer.

859
01:18:58.625 --> 01:18:59.958
You should reconsider.

860
01:19:01.375 --> 01:19:04.416
I can make sure no one signs them. Ever.

861
01:19:05.083 --> 01:19:07.041
You think you can give us 5.000 euros.

862
01:19:07.708 --> 01:19:10.666
and we will sign any piece of toilet paper
you give us?

863
01:19:21.958 --> 01:19:24.666
You know.
we can get you all sent back home.

864
01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:26.291
This is our home.

865
01:19:51.416 --> 01:19:53.916
Let's go inside. It's cold.

866
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.333
That was a lot of money.

867
01:20:12.125 --> 01:20:14.000
Guys! Guys!

868
01:20:14.833 --> 01:20:17.333
-Haris?
-Guys. I did it.

869
01:20:19.375 --> 01:20:21.833
I did it. This is big.

870
01:20:22.791 --> 01:20:23.791
We're going to Spain.

871
01:20:23.875 --> 01:20:25.958
Yeah! I mean. no. No.

872
01:20:26.041 --> 01:20:27.750
They-- They won't take the family.

873
01:20:31.625 --> 01:20:33.833
You are going to the NBA Draft.

874
01:20:42.583 --> 01:20:45.375
The NBA.

875
01:20:45.458 --> 01:20:48.000
If you are risking it all.
why not risk big?

876
01:20:48.083 --> 01:20:51.041
I called a US agent I met last year.
showed him the reel.

877
01:20:51.125 --> 01:20:53.958
He thinks Giannis is good enough
to be considered by the NBA teams.

878
01:20:54.041 --> 01:20:57.958
So I put an NBA buyout clause
into the Zaragoza contract.

879
01:20:58.041 --> 01:20:59.666
and Zaragoza agreed.

880
01:20:59.750 --> 01:21:01.625
The moment Giannis signs the Spanish deal.

881
01:21:01.708 --> 01:21:05.291
he becomes eligible for the NBA Draft
in New York City.

882
01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:07.500
I don't understand.

883
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:12.791
If an NBA team wants Giannis.
they can draft him for a fee.

884
01:21:12.875 --> 01:21:15.208
-And he never has to go to Spain.
-Wait. Wait.

885
01:21:15.291 --> 01:21:17.791
But to go to America. he needs a US Visa.

886
01:21:18.958 --> 01:21:20.958
I mean. the Greek authorities
will know his status.

887
01:21:21.041 --> 01:21:22.708
How exactly is this better
than going to Spain?

888
01:21:22.791 --> 01:21:27.208
An NBA team will reunite the family
in America.

889
01:21:28.958 --> 01:21:31.291
Why didn't we go right to the NBA before?

890
01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:35.625
There are only two routes
to the NBA Draft.

891
01:21:35.708 --> 01:21:37.708
Play for an American college

892
01:21:37.791 --> 01:21:41.375
or sign a contract
with an international pro team.

893
01:21:41.958 --> 01:21:45.291
The Zaragoza contract means
Giannis is eligible now.

894
01:21:46.166 --> 01:21:47.833
What if he doesn't get picked?

895
01:21:47.916 --> 01:21:49.125
We will be exposed.

896
01:21:51.125 --> 01:21:53.000
And Giannis will be without us in Spain.

897
01:21:54.708 --> 01:21:56.583
But what if I do get picked?

898
01:22:04.083 --> 01:22:05.583
How did you get into the country?

899
01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:09.208
Um. w-we were born here.

900
01:22:10.541 --> 01:22:11.958
We both were.

901
01:22:16.250 --> 01:22:19.166
We've been up and down
this building for weeks.

902
01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:22.666
Forms. duplicates. countersignatures.

903
01:22:23.166 --> 01:22:25.458
-Now. someone said to me that--
-Is that--

904
01:22:27.083 --> 01:22:28.208
Is that your son?

905
01:22:32.125 --> 01:22:33.916
He looks like he can really play ball.

906
01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.750
He's captain in his high school team.

907
01:22:35.833 --> 01:22:37.416
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

908
01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:38.833
What position does he play?

909
01:22:42.416 --> 01:22:43.416
Forward.

910
01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:46.000
-Forward? I'm a forward.
-Mm-hmm.

911
01:22:46.708 --> 01:22:49.750
Small forward.
but I can play point guard too.

912
01:22:51.083 --> 01:22:54.333
You know. only the best players
are chosen to play forward.

913
01:22:54.416 --> 01:22:56.875
Yes. You really have to show up.

914
01:22:57.625 --> 01:23:03.791
The way he's positioned. holds the ball.
he looks like he really works hard.

915
01:23:04.708 --> 01:23:08.000
-What do you think. Thano?
-He looks like the real deal. man.

916
01:23:11.166 --> 01:23:13.250
You can tell all that from a photo?

917
01:23:14.583 --> 01:23:16.708
All we do is play basketball.

918
01:23:18.291 --> 01:23:19.916
That's all we do.

919
01:23:20.750 --> 01:23:24.791
You must know how difficult it is
for us to get to this place.

920
01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:29.833
All we need is a temporary visa.
so we can return home to our family.

921
01:23:29.916 --> 01:23:32.875
Only one of you has been selected
for the draft.

922
01:23:32.958 --> 01:23:35.916
My mom says he can't go without me.

923
01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.291
He's young. He needs a chaperone.

924
01:23:53.083 --> 01:23:55.916
Why don't you stop marveling at that
and help me pack?

925
01:23:56.708 --> 01:23:59.291
They spelt my name the Greek way.
Is that okay?

926
01:23:59.375 --> 01:24:00.375
Don't worry.

927
01:24:00.875 --> 01:24:04.416
We will always know our own name. huh?
No matter how you spell it.

928
01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:08.000
They will know our name.

929
01:24:17.541 --> 01:24:19.708
Haris. look after my boys. huh?

930
01:24:20.291 --> 01:24:21.166
I will.

931
01:24:26.833 --> 01:24:28.375
You are your brother's keeper.

932
01:24:33.083 --> 01:24:35.375
I'll pray for you. Good luck.

933
01:24:38.083 --> 01:24:39.541
-Bye. Ma.
-I love you.

934
01:24:42.833 --> 01:24:45.791
Come here. I love you.

935
01:24:56.708 --> 01:24:58.166
You're gonna come back. right?

936
01:24:58.875 --> 01:24:59.875
Yes.

937
01:25:01.708 --> 01:25:03.041
I'll bring us together.

938
01:25:04.833 --> 01:25:06.208
Francis too.

939
01:25:09.375 --> 01:25:10.208
Come on.

940
01:25:32.458 --> 01:25:33.500

They'll bring you whatever you want.

I'm in the room across the hall.
Knock if you need anything.

973

We've got a busy day tomorrow.

974
01:27:04.083 --> 01:27:07.500
We'll go through our plans.
and then we have a dinner with Nike.

975
01:27:08.958 --> 01:27:10.416
-Nike?
-Yeah.

976
01:27:11.666 --> 01:27:14.666
Like shoes-on-my-feet Nike?

977
01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:19.125
Yeah. We're discussing them
paying you to wear their stuff.

978
01:27:19.208 --> 01:27:20.666
-What?
-Yeah.

979
01:27:20.750 --> 01:27:21.750
Get some rest. boys.

980
01:27:29.041 --> 01:27:31.791
So. what you going to do first?

981
01:27:31.875 --> 01:27:35.375
Think I'm going to take
the longest shower…

982
01:27:39.125 --> 01:27:40.416

A big night. A lot of angst. Jay.

988
01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.791
A lot of anticipation
for the 14 lottery teams.

989
01:27:57.875 --> 01:27:59.583
and the big question. of course.

990
01:27:59.666 --> 01:28:01.416
is who is gonna end up
with the number one pick?

991
01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:04.708
I've got Ben McLemore
as the number one overall prospect.

992
01:28:04.791 --> 01:28:06.083
Nerlens Noel of Kentucky.

993
01:28:06.166 --> 01:28:09.958
Another guy who could very well be
the top pick. if not the top prospect.

994
01:28:10.041 --> 01:28:13.583
What about Oklahoma? Twelfth?
They said they love his tape.

995
01:28:13.666 --> 01:28:16.083
Yeah. but they said that they also wanna
send him back to Europe

996
01:28:16.166 --> 01:28:17.541
for a few years to develop.

997
01:28:18.416 --> 01:28:22.083
Now. we could go top ten
if we went that route.

998
01:28:22.166 --> 01:28:24.333
No. they have to keep him in the US

999
01:28:24.416 --> 01:28:26.083
-and bring the family over.
-Okay.

1000
01:28:26.166 --> 01:28:28.666
Mystery man in the draft.
Giannis Antetokounmpo.

1001
01:28:28.750 --> 01:28:31.500
-Bro. that's you.
-That would be great alphabet soup.

1002
01:28:31.583 --> 01:28:33.250
But what he is. is 18 years old--

1003
01:28:33.333 --> 01:28:36.708
Can you put him in an NBA game now?
Probably not.

1004
01:28:36.791 --> 01:28:40.916
And if he drops below 17. the likelihood
of him getting picked is slim.

1005
01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.541
He's most likely going back to Europe.
That's how I see it.

1006
01:28:43.625 --> 01:28:45.291
So out of the 30 teams.

1007
01:28:45.375 --> 01:28:49.916
our best shot is anywhere between the 11th
and the 16th pick.

1008
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.166
That's Philadelphia at 11. Boston. 16.

1009
01:28:52.250 --> 01:28:54.333
Oklahoma. Dallas. Utah. Milwaukee
between them.

1010
01:28:54.416 --> 01:28:57.166
-So any team above 11 and below 16--
-They're saying I'm not good.

1011
01:28:59.416 --> 01:29:02.125
Giannis. don't believe everything you see
on TV. okay?

1012
01:29:02.208 --> 01:29:03.291
What about this?

1013
01:29:04.166 --> 01:29:06.125
They're saying
I'm not even getting picked.

1014
01:29:07.375 --> 01:29:10.958
Listen. this is the NBA Draft.
Anything can happen.

1015
01:29:11.041 --> 01:29:13.916
Tomorrow. we work the floor.
We meet the teams.

1016
01:29:17.458 --> 01:29:19.708
How soon can I get money for my family?

1017
01:29:19.791 --> 01:29:22.125
If Nike take him.
they can make an advance.

1018
01:29:22.208 --> 01:29:25.166
Yes. They will get the money
to your family immediately.

1019
01:29:25.250 --> 01:29:26.666
-All right?

1020
01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:29.125
So it's important
that you sell yourself to them tonight.

1021
01:29:37.708 --> 01:29:39.875
How am I supposed to sell myself tonight?

1022
01:29:41.083 --> 01:29:44.625
The other players on TV. they're famous.
from big college programs.

1023
01:29:45.541 --> 01:29:47.041
That's what Nike's looking for.

1024
01:29:49.333 --> 01:29:50.416
What do I tell them?

1025
01:30:07.208 --> 01:30:09.333
If Nike was to sign you.

1026
01:30:09.416 --> 01:30:11.541
what do you think you would bring
to our brand. Giannis?

1027
01:30:11.625 --> 01:30:12.750
Other than your game.

1028
01:30:12.833 --> 01:30:15.625
what sets you apart
from every other player tomorrow night?

1029
01:30:22.041 --> 01:30:23.416
Tell them who you are.

1030
01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:45.916
I used to borrow my brother's sneakers…

1031
01:30:47.916 --> 01:30:49.500
because we couldn't afford a second pair.

1032
01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.708
I would sleep on a mattress in the gym

1033
01:30:56.208 --> 01:31:00.833
so I could wake up and begin training
without losing any time.

1034
01:31:08.833 --> 01:31:14.083
We've seen our parents forced
to leave a child behind in one country

1035
01:31:14.166 --> 01:31:16.416
to build a future
for our family in another.

1036
01:31:17.875 --> 01:31:20.291
not knowing
if they would ever see him again.

1037
01:31:23.458 --> 01:31:27.416
We have hidden from the police
our entire lives because we were illegal.

1038
01:31:28.791 --> 01:31:32.500
Always from the outside looking in.
in the country where we were born.

1039
01:31:35.083 --> 01:31:36.125
We work harder.

1040
01:31:38.375 --> 01:31:39.375
We run farther.

1041
01:31:40.458 --> 01:31:45.375
And we are hungrier
because we know the meaning of sacrifice.

1042
01:31:49.250 --> 01:31:51.583
God has been watching over us.

1043
01:31:52.875 --> 01:31:54.875
And God will reunite our family again.

1044
01:31:56.166 --> 01:31:57.750
I just have to play my part.

1045
01:32:05.958 --> 01:32:06.958
So…

1046
01:32:09.250 --> 01:32:10.250
…did you like him?

1047
01:32:11.583 --> 01:32:14.166
We'll talk after the draft.
Good night. Haris.

1048
01:32:20.958 --> 01:32:23.750
{\an8}

1049
01:32:26.583 --> 01:32:29.250
{\an8}-That Euro step was something else.

1050
01:32:29.333 --> 01:32:31.083
{\an8}You've got a lot of potential.

1051
01:32:31.166 --> 01:32:33.375
You. my friend.
are gonna have a heck of a career.

1052
01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:36.916
The 76ers don't need a small forward.

1053
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.375
Well. he's also a guard.

1054
01:32:38.458 --> 01:32:40.708
He'll need work
to get himself strong enough for that.

1055
01:32:40.791 --> 01:32:42.958
I need someone I can throw in immediately.

1056
01:32:43.041 --> 01:32:44.458
You're not giving us access?

1057
01:32:44.541 --> 01:32:47.458
Guarantee you won't send him back
to Europe. and you'll meet him.

1058
01:32:47.541 --> 01:32:49.833
{\an8}He's not ready for this league.
and he's got no papers.

1059
01:32:49.916 --> 01:32:52.166
-Utah doesn't think that.
-Utah's yanking your chain.

1060
01:32:52.250 --> 01:32:53.833
They don't want him. We do.

1061
01:32:53.916 --> 01:32:55.000
How about I pick him at 12?

1062
01:32:55.083 --> 01:32:57.000
And there's nothing you
or Utah can do about it.

1063
01:32:58.333 --> 01:33:01.958
{\an8}Could you take me through
what you're doing here in the transition?

1064
01:33:02.041 --> 01:33:05.916
So. we're supposed to turn
defense into offense in eight seconds.

1065
01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.375
But if I turn and power out.
I can do it in five.

1066
01:33:09.458 --> 01:33:12.208
Our forward would've been intercepted here
by their guards.

1067
01:33:12.291 --> 01:33:13.875
so I went with our center.

1068
01:33:13.958 --> 01:33:16.041
Faked a pass and switched up the rhythm.

1069
01:33:16.708 --> 01:33:17.708
Uh…

1070
01:33:19.333 --> 01:33:21.416
You know anything about Milwaukee.
Giannis?

1071
01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:24.208
No. sir. but I would love to learn.

1072
01:33:25.416 --> 01:33:29.083
Great. Good. Let's go.
Well. thank you so much.

1073
01:33:29.166 --> 01:33:30.500
-Thank you.
-Best of luck.

1074
01:33:30.583 --> 01:33:31.666
You too.

1075
01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:32.750
Thanks. gentlemen.

1076
01:33:35.666 --> 01:33:37.500
John. John. John. listen.

1077
01:33:38.291 --> 01:33:40.500
So what do you think?
We have a shot at 15th?

1078
01:33:40.583 --> 01:33:43.833
Yeah. he's a brilliant mind.
The best I've seen in a long time.

1079
01:33:43.916 --> 01:33:46.458
But he is far from finished. okay?

1080
01:33:46.541 --> 01:33:49.000
Um. it could be all season
before he makes the team.

1081
01:33:49.083 --> 01:33:52.875
And his undocumented status.
that's a concern. to say the least.

1082
01:33:52.958 --> 01:33:55.541
I'm not gonna lie to you guys. It's risky.

1083
01:33:57.041 --> 01:33:58.541
Have a good day. gentlemen.

1084
01:34:04.333 --> 01:34:07.083
Milwaukee would have kept him
in America. right?

1085
01:34:07.583 --> 01:34:08.625
Yeah.

1086
01:34:13.375 --> 01:34:14.458
What are you doing?

1087
01:34:14.541 --> 01:34:18.083
I'm gonna call Utah and Atlanta.
see where they are.

1088
01:34:18.166 --> 01:34:20.625
This isn't just some kid
getting drafted. Kevin.

1089
01:34:21.333 --> 01:34:22.375
I know.

1090
01:34:22.458 --> 01:34:24.583
He might never see his family again.

1091
01:34:39.958 --> 01:34:43.416
Is there a chance
I might not get picked at all?

1092
01:34:43.916 --> 01:34:47.416
Hey. people come here all the time
and don't get picked.

1093
01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:50.458
Dwight Buycks. Diante Garrett.
JaMychal Green.

1094
01:34:51.041 --> 01:34:52.708
They all made it to the NBA.

1095
01:34:54.083 --> 01:34:56.416
It's not where you start.
It's where you finish.

1096
01:35:02.333 --> 01:35:03.541
Excuse me. Sorry. sir.

1097
01:35:03.625 --> 01:35:05.000
Excuse me. please. Thank you.

1098
01:35:05.958 --> 01:35:09.000
The 2013 NBA Draft preview.

1099
01:35:10.208 --> 01:35:12.541
-Kostas. always running. running. huh?
-Now it's time.

1100
01:35:12.625 --> 01:35:14.833
Fifteen minutes
until the Cavaliers go on the clock…

1101
01:35:14.916 --> 01:35:17.250
-You won't see anything like that.
-…and start the NBA Draft 2013.

1102
01:35:17.333 --> 01:35:18.333
Okay. I'll watch.

1103
01:35:18.416 --> 01:35:20.083
Orlando and Washington
sitting just behind.

1104
01:35:20.166 --> 01:35:24.166
He has all the power
of his mother's prayers with him.

1105
01:35:25.291 --> 01:35:28.500
He's his father's son.
He doesn't know when to quit.

1106
01:35:28.583 --> 01:35:29.583
Mm-hmm.

1107
01:35:33.041 --> 01:35:38.041
Ladies and gentlemen.
welcome to the 2013 NBA Draft.

1108
01:35:38.125 --> 01:35:40.083
Please take your seats.

1109
01:35:46.416 --> 01:35:48.083
Noel is gonna go first?

1110
01:35:48.166 --> 01:35:49.791
He's definitely going first.

1111
01:35:49.875 --> 01:35:52.083
No. No. he's too skinny.
No offensive game.

1112
01:35:53.083 --> 01:35:56.625
Gianni. thank you for having my back.

1113
01:35:57.458 --> 01:35:58.958
Family always sticks together.

1114
01:36:02.041 --> 01:36:04.083
It's starting! It's starting!
It's starting!

1115
01:36:12.875 --> 01:36:15.333
Here to do the honors for 2013.

1116
01:36:15.416 --> 01:36:18.291
the commissioner of the NBA.
Mr. David Stern.

1117
01:36:18.375 --> 01:36:23.541
Good evening. and thank you
for that enthusiastic Brooklyn welcome.

1118
01:36:24.791 --> 01:36:29.541
Tonight is the culmination
of years of dedication and hard work

1119
01:36:29.625 --> 01:36:31.958
for the best young players in the world.

1120
01:36:32.041 --> 01:36:35.000
as well as the family and friends
who support them.

1121
01:36:35.833 --> 01:36:39.375
And I know the young men hoping to hear
their names called tonight

1122
01:36:39.958 --> 01:36:42.791
cannot wait to join the NBA family.

1123
01:36:42.875 --> 01:36:44.041
So let's begin.

1124
01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:47.083

Anthony Bennett.

1128
01:36:59.583 --> 01:37:03.791
You saw the disappointment on Noel's face
that he wasn't selected number one.

1129
01:37:04.625 --> 01:37:06.041
The second pick.

1130

Michael Carter-Williams
from Syracuse University.

1140
01:37:51.250 --> 01:37:55.250
What even is a 76er?
Seventy-sixes cannot play basketball.

1141
01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.375
It's okay. Don't worry.

1142
01:37:57.458 --> 01:38:01.500
We have five more picks including Utah.
All the way down to Boston at 16.

1143

It's gonna be okay. Keep hopeful.

1151
01:38:36.791 --> 01:38:38.125
What if nobody picks him?

1152
01:38:45.208 --> 01:38:47.416
Maybe they can find a first rounder

1153
01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:49.416
who can help lift their spirits a bit.

1154
01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:50.750
Fifteenth overall.

1155
01:38:50.833 --> 01:38:53.500
Bucks. of course.
having to rebuild their roster just a bit.

1156
01:38:54.333 --> 01:38:55.583
What about Milwaukee?

1157
01:38:56.250 --> 01:38:58.041
Milwaukee hasn't called me back yet.

1158
01:39:02.708 --> 01:39:04.875
We see the clock has expired

1159
01:39:04.958 --> 01:39:07.666
and David Stern
about to announce the selection.

1160
01:39:50.458 --> 01:39:55.708

Yeah!

1165
01:40:33.041 --> 01:40:35.041
I told them! I told you! I told you!

1166
01:40:41.625 --> 01:40:44.250
Yeah. man! All right!

1167
01:40:50.333 --> 01:40:52.000
-Yeah. Kevin!
-Whoo!

1168
01:41:06.791 --> 01:41:08.458
Oh. man.

1169
01:41:32.208 --> 01:41:35.416
Antetokounmpo.
A very special night for him.

1170
01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:40.791
His parents from right to left.
Mother. Veronica. Father. Charles.

1171
01:41:40.875 --> 01:41:45.666
Brother. Alex. And sixteen-year-old.
6'7" Kostas Antetokounmpo!

1172
01:42:10.458 --> 01:42:11.625
{\an8}I want to thank my dad.

1173
01:42:11.708 --> 01:42:13.000
Um…

1174
01:42:13.083 --> 01:42:16.250
Obviously. you know.
my dad is not here with me. but. uh…

1175
01:42:19.125 --> 01:42:22.291
Every day that I step on the floor.
I always think about my dad.

1176
01:42:22.375 --> 01:42:25.625
and that motivates me
and pushes me to. you know. play harder.

1177
01:42:27.083 --> 01:42:30.916
I want to thank my amazing brothers.
You know I love you guys.

1178
01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:36.708
I want to thank my amazing mom.
She's my hero.

1179
01:42:36.791 --> 01:42:39.125
When you are a little kid.
you don't see the future. right?

1180
01:42:39.208 --> 01:42:44.416
And if you have a good parent.
your parent sees the future for you.

1181
01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:48.666
And she always saw the future in us.
She always believe in us. My true hero.

1182
01:43:02.208 --> 01:43:04.666
{\an8}That is an awesome shot.

1183
01:43:05.750 --> 01:43:07.500
{\an8}Kostas Antetokounmpo!

1184
01:43:13.291 --> 01:43:16.000
{\an8}Another three from Alex. Got it.

1185
01:43:24.625 --> 01:43:26.333
{\an8}I'm so proud of him.

1186
01:43:26.416 --> 01:43:30.958
{\an8}-We love you so much. Congratulations.
-We're proud of you. We love you.

1187
01:43:31.041 --> 01:43:34.791
{\an8}We're extremely happy for you
for bringing the first ring home.

1188
01:43:34.875 --> 01:43:36.833
{\an8}Let's get more rings. man.
Let's get more rings. Come on.

1189
01:43:39.625 --> 01:43:43.250
Shot blocked by Antetokounmpo!
What a block from Giannis!

1190
01:43:50.041 --> 01:43:53.916
Giannis. Slam it! How about that?

1191
01:43:57.125 --> 01:44:00.125
Only the seventh player
in the history of the Finals

1192
01:44:00.208 --> 01:44:01.958
to have a fifty-point game!

1193
01:44:02.041 --> 01:44:03.333
And that'll do it!

1194
01:44:04.166 --> 01:44:07.208
The Milwaukee Bucks
are NBA champions once again!

1195
01:44:07.291 --> 01:44:10.083
Finals MVP.
Giannis Antetokounmpo!

1196
01:44:10.166 --> 01:44:12.541
MVP! MVP!

1197
01:44:12.625 --> 01:44:17.833
MVP! MVP! MVP! MVP!

1198
01:44:17.916 --> 01:44:20.625
MVP! MVP!

1199
01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.208
-Let's do it again.
-Whoo!

01:51:09.291 --> 01:51:10.291
Yeah.
