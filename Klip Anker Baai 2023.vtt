00:01:28.178 --> 00:01:29.789
Alec!

4
00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.267
Alec!

5
00:01:47.612 --> 00:01:48.618
Wait!

6
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.705
Alec. you must not go.

7
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.113
Baby. what are you doing?

8
00:01:53.144 --> 00:01:55.261
Alec. wait...

9
00:01:55.435 --> 00:01:57.510
I have a bad feeling.

10
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.157
You must not go.

11
00:02:01.032 --> 00:02:04.044
It’s going to be fine Baby.
I’m just going to talk to them.

12
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.453
No. no. Alec. you don’t understand...

13
00:02:07.478 --> 00:02:10.353
I had a terrible dream
and you must not go out.

14
00:02:10.601 --> 00:02:12.126
You must not go brother!

15
00:02:12.326 --> 00:02:14.384
I can save the situation. Baby. okay.

16
00:02:14.521 --> 00:02:17.361
It’s not going to be okay
please. I'm begging you...

17
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.469
I'll see you later. okay.

18
00:02:18.524 --> 00:02:20.047
I’m begging you. don't go.

19
00:02:20.953 --> 00:02:23.358
Its alright Baby... It will be fine.

20
00:03:47.897 --> 00:03:50.500
Good morning bang on
time and looking good.

21
00:03:50.592 --> 00:03:52.230
Morning. has Sherman arrived?

22
00:03:52.255 --> 00:03:55.973
Yes. he’s been here half an hour
and he brought his wife.

23
00:03:56.527 --> 00:03:59.441
This is a copy of his
assets. be gentle...

24
00:03:59.641 --> 00:04:01.224
Oh. but I always am.

25
00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:04.416
Oh wow that’s quite
a bit of property.

26
00:04:04.441 --> 00:04:06.803
I know. and one or
two in prime positions.

27
00:04:06.864 --> 00:04:09.392
They could save the company
if they leverage it against...

28
00:04:09.417 --> 00:04:13.112
Sashi. that’s not your job or mine.

29
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.533
I know you want to see
the silver lining in everything.

30
00:04:16.816 --> 00:04:18.828
but that’s not why we
are here at Foster.

31
00:04:19.376 --> 00:04:21.823
I know it might seem
ruthless and uncaring.

32
00:04:21.968 --> 00:04:23.770
when we buy these
companies in distress...

33
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.994
but we give them
life again with the

34
00:04:26.058 --> 00:04:28.042
bits and pieces
that we sell off.

35
00:04:28.137 --> 00:04:29.275
That is what we do.

36
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.370
And you do it very well.
but this company is not dead.

37
00:04:32.521 --> 00:04:34.032
You can actually save them.

38
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.133
That... I don’t do well.

39
00:04:36.288 --> 00:04:37.712
Now. how do I look?

40
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.363
Hmm.

41
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.487
Well power suit. check.

42
00:04:40.577 --> 00:04:42.098
Hair did. check.

43
00:04:42.177 --> 00:04:45.930
Impeccable make-up. check
and of course Eye Of The Tiger.

44
00:04:46.317 --> 00:04:47.581
As always. deadly.

45
00:04:47.606 --> 00:04:48.606
Why thank you.

46
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.120
- Now...
- Now...

47
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.374
- Let’s go get that money...
- Let’s go get that money...

48
00:04:53.288 --> 00:04:53.946
Wow...

49
00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:56.228
Still quoting Top Gun. hey?

50
00:04:56.505 --> 00:04:57.663
That’s a nice throwback.

51
00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.413
No Clyde. you cannot
join the meeting.

52
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.584
You know Alex. you need a
tough. uncompromising wing man.

53
00:05:05.609 --> 00:05:10.079
Not a lame “goose” weighing you
down with a dead weight conscience.

54
00:05:11.425 --> 00:05:13.633
What is the deal
with you two anyway.

55
00:05:13.658 --> 00:05:16.113
I never see you with any
guys. are you guys a couple?

56
00:05:16.138 --> 00:05:18.791
Okay... It's not
your season Clyde.

57
00:05:18.962 --> 00:05:19.740
Back off.

58
00:05:24.312 --> 00:05:25.504
Oh...

59
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.358
Alex Donnay. yes.

60
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.060
Alex...

61
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.487
It’s Katie speaking. we just...

62
00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.938
Listen Katie. not
a good time. sorry.

63
00:05:48.113 --> 00:05:48.939
What...

64
00:05:51.114 --> 00:05:52.114
Call again.

65
00:05:52.937 --> 00:05:54.296
- Ma'am...
- Call...

66
00:05:55.375 --> 00:05:56.482
You’re good to go.

67
00:06:03.592 --> 00:06:06.115
I started this
company 30 years ago

68
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.607
and I built it up.

69
00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.321
Over a hundred are my staff...

70
00:06:13.875 --> 00:06:14.875
Legacy.

71
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.805
I understand.

72
00:06:17.491 --> 00:06:20.094
You want your life’s work
to count for something.

73
00:06:20.225 --> 00:06:22.358
What are you offering Ms Donnay?

74
00:06:26.128 --> 00:06:28.207
Oh. I’m so sorry...

75
00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.360
Mr Sherman...

76
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.934
What we are offering is more
than enough to protect your legacy.

77
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.375
Leave something for your
workers. insure their dignity.

78
00:06:47.364 --> 00:06:49.764
You’ve worked really
hard. Mr Sherman.

79
00:06:49.912 --> 00:06:51.411
Let us take care of the rest.

80
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.249
And you and Mrs. Sherman
can finally take it easy

81
00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.943
with enough for a long
and comfortable retirement.

82
00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.480
It’s time.

83
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.320
Let us take it from here.

84
00:07:10.947 --> 00:07:11.947
Okay.

85
00:07:21.683 --> 00:07:23.206
We are so happy for you both.

86
00:07:31.097 --> 00:07:33.335
Of course there
is some paper work.

87
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.295
Sashi will take you through it.

88
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.155
Thank you Mr Sherman.
Mrs Sherman.

89
00:07:42.272 --> 00:07:44.581
Call back that last number
for me. for goodness sake

90
00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.578
If you would just follow
me to the boardroom.

91
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.893
Nicely done. Donnay.

92
00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.454
You know you nearly
lost them with the...

93
00:07:57.608 --> 00:07:59.685
I could do with a
drink after that.

94
00:08:00.784 --> 00:08:01.567
Join me.

95
00:08:01.888 --> 00:08:03.268
What a question...

96
00:08:06.793 --> 00:08:07.793
Congratulations.

97
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.760
Thank you sir. I
appreciate the support.

98
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:11.588
You know...

99
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.069
I couldn’t have
done it better myself.

100
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.571
even in my younger days.

101
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.239
Hmm.

102
00:08:20.628 --> 00:08:21.748
Come. join me.

103
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.648
You know what this is
what keeps me going.

104
00:08:26.088 --> 00:08:26.437
Huh.

105
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.987
One day. wind in my hair.

106
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.063
the sand between my toes...

107
00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:36.001
Umm... No thanks sir. I’m good.

108
00:08:36.176 --> 00:08:38.274
If you can get
the next big one...

109
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.837
Mrs Moloi. Black Silk Cosmetics.

110
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.714
I will have to
make you a partner.

111
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.089
Then the sky’s the limit.

112
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.520
Well Louie...

113
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.751
I suggest you get
the paper work ready.

114
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.710
I’m so sorry sir. Alex...

115
00:09:02.864 --> 00:09:03.298
When?

116
00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.714
I think yesterday...

117
00:09:05.857 --> 00:09:06.547
Uhm...

118
00:09:06.696 --> 00:09:07.994
- She said that...
- Aunty Baby?

119
00:09:08.115 --> 00:09:08.462
Yes.

120
00:09:09.681 --> 00:09:11.617
She said it was an accident.

121
00:09:12.189 --> 00:09:13.568
On a boat...

122
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.811
My father was a fisherman.

123
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:21.584
Lex when do you want to leave?

124
00:09:21.609 --> 00:09:23.109
Okay. I will book your flight.

125
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.651
When’s the funeral?

126
00:09:24.857 --> 00:09:25.476
Saturday.

127
00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:28.817
I want to drive.

128
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.327
I’ll leave tomorrow. in and out.

129
00:09:32.015 --> 00:09:33.015
then back here.

130
00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.907
I’ll mourn tomorrow.

131
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.108
Today I want to celebrate.

132
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:39.460
Come-on...

133
00:09:40.072 --> 00:09:40.889
Have another round.

134
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.603
You are such a bad influence.

135
00:09:43.796 --> 00:09:44.799
My goodness...

136
00:09:44.967 --> 00:09:47.033
It's a good thing
we're taking an Uber.

137
00:09:49.492 --> 00:09:50.492
You know what Lex...

138
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.503
You deserve a corner office.

139
00:09:52.535 --> 00:09:53.792
- Oh yes I do.
- And...

140
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.294
Yeah.

141
00:09:54.319 --> 00:09:56.780
And I deserve a new car.

142
00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:57.933
- because I don’t think my KIA...
- Hmm.

143
00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.361
is going to make
it to Christmas.

144
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:03.079
Oh my gosh I love this song!

145
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.960
Uhm...

146
00:10:08.632 --> 00:10:09.595
Lex...

147
00:10:10.088 --> 00:10:13.930
I know you haven’t had a
great relationship with your dad

148
00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:17.633
but I thought we could do a
toast or something for him.

149
00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:18.920
Why not...

150
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.274
To Alec Donnay.

151
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:23.680
fisherman.

152
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.445
- friend of the people.
- Hmm.

153
00:10:25.656 --> 00:10:27.005
part time father...

154
00:10:28.696 --> 00:10:29.490
Okay...

155
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.318
To Alec!

156
00:10:31.438 --> 00:10:31.916
Yes.

157
00:10:32.208 --> 00:10:32.963
Ah...

158
00:10:33.138 --> 00:10:33.662
Hmm...

159
00:10:34.529 --> 00:10:35.839
- Come let’s dance...
- Oh my gosh.

160
00:10:35.911 --> 00:10:38.037
- Please Sashi...
- I'm coming...

161
00:11:17.811 --> 00:11:19.172
Come Alex...

162
00:11:20.983 --> 00:11:21.597
Come...

163
00:11:24.239 --> 00:11:25.239
Daddy...

164
00:11:26.432 --> 00:11:28.034
No. Daddy...

165
00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.560
Alex come...

166
00:11:36.731 --> 00:11:37.261
Alex!

167
00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:40.640
Dad!

168
00:11:41.517 --> 00:11:42.517
Dad!

169
00:12:23.658 --> 00:12:27.292
So Mr Julies why is the
concession so important to you?

170
00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:31.739
Well. look they just closed
factory in. Stompneus Bay.

171
00:12:31.785 --> 00:12:34.105
Where are those
people suppose to go?

172
00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:35.136
That's my question...

173
00:12:35.161 --> 00:12:36.728
How are they to make a living?

174
00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:41.517
And then we reports about our
government talking with big companies

175
00:12:41.542 --> 00:12:46.506
about big projects. fracking
and drilling for gas off our shores.

176
00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.835
So to answer your question.

177
00:12:47.887 --> 00:12:49.957
This is important and
its very complicated.

178
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.087
Mr Foster. morning sir.

179
00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:59.267
Alex... Sashi told me
all about your father.

180
00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:01.968
My sincere condolences.

181
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.723
Well look. you take
all the time you need.

182
00:13:05.238 --> 00:13:08.754
I’m sure Daro can handle
the Moloi matter from here...

183
00:13:08.888 --> 00:13:12.262
No! No. sir. don’t let
Clyde anywhere near it.

184
00:13:12.615 --> 00:13:14.780
Sashi has already set up a
meeting for next Thursday.

185
00:13:14.805 --> 00:13:16.026
I’ll be back then.

186
00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.007
If you’re sure...

187
00:13:18.288 --> 00:13:20.119
Yes. one hundred percent. sir.

188
00:13:20.144 --> 00:13:23.288
I’m totally prepared
for Mrs Moloi.

189
00:13:23.753 --> 00:13:26.258
as I said. you can get those
partnership papers ready!

190
00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.120
I won’t disappoint you. sir.

191
00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:29.960
Very well.

192
00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.346
Best wishes from us all.

193
00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.113
See you next week.

194
00:13:34.217 --> 00:13:35.248
Thank you. sir.

195
00:13:37.172 --> 00:13:39.277
Is there anything else
I can do for you sir?

196
00:13:39.576 --> 00:13:40.239
Uhm.

197
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.254
Just get the door Clive.

198
00:13:42.561 --> 00:13:45.185
It’s Clyde. sir.

199
00:13:46.142 --> 00:13:47.149
Really?

200
00:13:47.753 --> 00:13:48.393
Yes.

201
00:14:10.398 --> 00:14:13.049
David my boy. come in.

202
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.121
Thank you for coming.

203
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.203
Of course. sir.

204
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.739
You're a good man. David.

205
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.440
Very likeable...

206
00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:28.021
But that’s not getting
you anywhere. now is it?

207
00:14:29.088 --> 00:14:29.751
Sir?

208
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.745
I’m running out of patience.

209
00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.525
This West Coast deal is
becoming a bit of a bore. honestly.

210
00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.884
If you can't get Kruger to bring
me more boats with their quotas.

211
00:14:41.816 --> 00:14:44.225
pronto. then it's...

212
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.588
To coin a phrase...

213
00:14:47.064 --> 00:14:48.286
Dead in the water.

214
00:14:48.742 --> 00:14:51.140
Mr Gunther. Allied
had a dozen boats

215
00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.246
six months ago when
we started negotiations.

216
00:14:54.767 --> 00:14:56.314
They now have eighteen...

217
00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.841
Eighteen...

218
00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.730
That's a good size fleet...

219
00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.591
But I’m thinking twenty-five
boats and their quotas

220
00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.799
is a bit more worthy of
Gunther and Arkin acquisition.

221
00:15:10.487 --> 00:15:12.949
Am I right or am I right?

222
00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:14.589
Of course. sir.

223
00:15:14.796 --> 00:15:17.550
I’ll get right onto speaking
to Kruger. immediately.

224
00:15:18.318 --> 00:15:19.146
Look...

225
00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.482
The wife and I will be flying
up to the holiday house.

226
00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.940
And we are going to
need a car down there. so...

227
00:15:28.522 --> 00:15:32.524
Why don’t you drive
down. stay in the house.

228
00:15:33.382 --> 00:15:36.074
Put some pressure on Kruger.

229
00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:41.232
to make Allied Fishing a little bit
more what we would like it to be.

230
00:15:47.522 --> 00:15:48.903
I knew I could count on you.

231
00:15:51.695 --> 00:15:52.750
Good man. off you go.

232
00:15:52.775 --> 00:15:53.656
Yes.

233
00:17:00.173 --> 00:17:01.657
Oh no. no. no...

234
00:17:02.062 --> 00:17:02.665
Oh! Thank God.

235
00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:06.443
Ma'am. ma'am can you hear me.
Hello! Ma'am are you okay.

236
00:17:09.008 --> 00:17:09.651
Ma'am!

237
00:17:12.184 --> 00:17:13.199
Oh thank God.

238
00:17:13.343 --> 00:17:14.366
Are you okay?

239
00:17:15.001 --> 00:17:15.398
Yeah?

240
00:17:18.184 --> 00:17:19.890
- Sorry about what happened...
- You’re an idiot.

241
00:17:20.271 --> 00:17:20.874
What!

242
00:17:21.104 --> 00:17:22.172
If you hadn’t swerved like that...

243
00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:25.669
You overtook on a blind rise.
asshole. That’s what happened!

244
00:17:26.846 --> 00:17:27.553
Okay...

245
00:17:28.045 --> 00:17:29.481
Can I get you some water. please?

246
00:17:30.096 --> 00:17:31.191
No thanks.

247
00:17:33.223 --> 00:17:34.270
You sure you okay?

248
00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:35.921
You’re not hurt or anything?

249
00:17:36.226 --> 00:17:38.408
Who knows? Right
now I’m in shock. bud.

250
00:17:39.434 --> 00:17:40.124
Listen...

251
00:17:40.902 --> 00:17:42.275
I’m really sorry.

252
00:17:42.457 --> 00:17:45.695
Both your tires. they're shot.

253
00:17:46.529 --> 00:17:47.505
Nice!

254
00:17:50.066 --> 00:17:51.051
David Mhlatse.

255
00:17:56.246 --> 00:17:57.253
Hey Sash.

256
00:17:59.566 --> 00:18:01.709
I'm not there yet;
I’m on the R27.

257
00:18:03.018 --> 00:18:06.380
Some moron in a G-wagon
just drove me off the road.

258
00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:08.391
No. I’m totally fine.

259
00:18:09.111 --> 00:18:10.785
Can you please send a tow-truck.

260
00:18:11.261 --> 00:18:11.714
Okay.

261
00:18:12.634 --> 00:18:13.396
Thanks Sash.

262
00:18:13.948 --> 00:18:14.599
Ciao.

263
00:18:16.234 --> 00:18:18.702
My PA’s going to send a
tow-truck. You don’t have to wait.

264
00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:19.579
What?

265
00:18:20.055 --> 00:18:22.319
I mean. I can’t leave
you here. it’s not safe.

266
00:18:23.561 --> 00:18:24.188
Please...

267
00:18:25.625 --> 00:18:27.453
Let me help you fix this?

268
00:18:28.387 --> 00:18:29.179
Yeah?

269
00:18:32.902 --> 00:18:33.955
So. what’s your plan?

270
00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:35.757
Let me grab that for you.

271
00:18:36.307 --> 00:18:36.926
Okay...

272
00:18:45.172 --> 00:18:46.090
Wait!

273
00:19:06.942 --> 00:19:07.836
Okay...

274
00:19:14.853 --> 00:19:16.483
How did you know
about this place?

275
00:19:16.629 --> 00:19:18.226
Oh. it’s been around for ages.

276
00:19:19.027 --> 00:19:20.131
Are those weavers?

277
00:19:20.265 --> 00:19:20.804
Yeah.

278
00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.336
Wait till the
night-noises start.

279
00:19:23.483 --> 00:19:25.539
- Greetings. David.
- Greetings. Lindi.

280
00:19:25.636 --> 00:19:26.763
Greetings. ma’am.

281
00:19:26.985 --> 00:19:27.660
Hi.

282
00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:31.003
We’ve booked you guy in a very
nice room with a king-sized bed.

283
00:19:31.361 --> 00:19:33.962
- No. no we're not... together...
- We are not a couple. it's just...

284
00:19:36.321 --> 00:19:38.368
The restaurant is open from six.

285
00:19:38.551 --> 00:19:39.051
Thanks.

286
00:19:42.051 --> 00:19:43.527
Not even slightly awkward.

287
00:19:44.979 --> 00:19:46.122
Sorry about that.

288
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:47.247
Airbags?

289
00:19:48.541 --> 00:19:49.620
So it was an accident!

290
00:19:49.882 --> 00:19:51.184
Really. it wasn’t...

291
00:19:51.718 --> 00:19:54.861
It’s just that my two tires popped.
They’re fixing them in Darling

292
00:19:55.252 --> 00:19:57.141
But your brother can
come and fetch you.

293
00:19:57.744 --> 00:19:59.180
It’s just an hour or so.

294
00:19:59.387 --> 00:20:00.585
No. no. no...

295
00:20:00.728 --> 00:20:05.093
I’ve already booked a room and my car
will be here first thing in the morning.

296
00:20:05.476 --> 00:20:08.683
We are all ready for you. Lexie.

297
00:20:09.262 --> 00:20:09.968
I know.

298
00:20:11.611 --> 00:20:14.127
I’ll be in good time for
the service. I promise.

299
00:20:14.634 --> 00:20:16.072
And what’s the matter with you?

300
00:20:17.436 --> 00:20:20.738
Have you forgotten
how to speak Afrikaans?

301
00:20:21.375 --> 00:20:23.583
Sorry. Aunty Baby.

302
00:20:23.918 --> 00:20:25.902
I will call again
in the morning.

303
00:20:26.836 --> 00:20:27.527
Bye.

304
00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:32.677
English...

305
00:20:33.894 --> 00:20:35.663
High. high English...

306
00:20:36.077 --> 00:20:37.987
So she’s not coming tonight?

307
00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:40.870
Apparently not...

308
00:20:50.807 --> 00:20:51.960
Mommy?

309
00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:53.548
I'm alright.

310
00:20:53.835 --> 00:20:55.733
The tears must
come out my child.

311
00:21:01.558 --> 00:21:03.431
Foster Enterprises...

312
00:21:03.761 --> 00:21:04.635
I’m impressed.

313
00:21:06.539 --> 00:21:07.912
You know we have
something in common.

314
00:21:08.496 --> 00:21:12.065
Two little pilot fish working
for the great white sharks.

315
00:21:12.956 --> 00:21:14.913
Well. not so little
for much longer.

316
00:21:14.964 --> 00:21:15.400
Hmm

317
00:21:15.425 --> 00:21:17.940
If I close my next deal
I’m in line for a partnership.

318
00:21:18.147 --> 00:21:18.830
Wow.

319
00:21:23.121 --> 00:21:24.135
What do you do?

320
00:21:25.124 --> 00:21:26.535
Much the same as you.

321
00:21:27.069 --> 00:21:30.323
A bit less business-stripping
and a bit more asset-building.

322
00:21:30.767 --> 00:21:31.799
And unlike you.

323
00:21:32.331 --> 00:21:34.235
if I don't close my
next deal I might just...

324
00:21:34.759 --> 00:21:36.347
Lose my job.

325
00:21:38.304 --> 00:21:40.130
So. how did you
know about this place?

326
00:21:42.796 --> 00:21:44.836
My mom worked
for an anthropologist.

327
00:21:45.272 --> 00:21:46.479
A very good lady.

328
00:21:46.867 --> 00:21:48.808
She use to bring us
here when we were kids.

329
00:21:49.451 --> 00:21:50.269
We?

330
00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:52.789
Younger sister...

331
00:22:20.841 --> 00:22:21.955
Do you mind.

332
00:22:34.151 --> 00:22:36.135
Come! Come dance with me...

333
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:40.167
Dance with me.

334
00:22:40.678 --> 00:22:44.598
Sorry. I can’t I have
to call it a night.

335
00:22:49.561 --> 00:22:50.966
Thank you for trusting me.

336
00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:37.459
- Everything ready. Katie?
- Yes mommy.

337
00:23:37.599 --> 00:23:39.429
I think we have enough.

338
00:23:40.619 --> 00:23:42.055
Where is Alex?

339
00:23:42.734 --> 00:23:45.125
It’s probably almost
quarter to. isn't it?

340
00:23:45.499 --> 00:23:48.903
My condolences. Baby.

341
00:23:49.599 --> 00:23:51.930
- We’re ready for you. Aunty Baby. Katie.
- Thank you Father.

342
00:23:53.234 --> 00:23:56.265
Katie... Father. when will I
say my speech again?

343
00:23:56.322 --> 00:23:58.046
Russell. Here’s the
order of the service.

344
00:23:58.071 --> 00:23:58.412
Okay.

345
00:23:59.873 --> 00:24:00.658
Fine. thanks.

346
00:24:02.701 --> 00:24:03.384
Aunt Babes.

347
00:24:04.294 --> 00:24:04.882
Where’s Alex?

348
00:24:05.294 --> 00:24:06.350
I don’t know my boy.

349
00:24:07.493 --> 00:24:08.056
I don’t know.

350
00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:11.328
Alec and I were on the
same trawler since we were...

351
00:24:11.922 --> 00:24:13.001
Small boys.

352
00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.533
Condolences to all of you.

353
00:24:18.435 --> 00:24:19.713
Condolences.

354
00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:24.086
Mom.

355
00:24:24.515 --> 00:24:25.824
Come lets go in.

356
00:24:26.312 --> 00:24:28.285
Hmm.

357
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:41.919
Alec...

358
00:24:42.805 --> 00:24:45.087
Did so much for us.

359
00:24:45.766 --> 00:24:47.164
He was stubborn.

360
00:24:48.534 --> 00:24:51.078
And that is why we
loved him so much.

361
00:24:57.871 --> 00:25:00.339
When he had his
mind set on something...

362
00:25:00.808 --> 00:25:02.286
He always saw it through...

363
00:25:02.802 --> 00:25:04.659
Come hell. or high waters.

364
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:14.553
If Alex was here...

365
00:25:14.694 --> 00:25:16.503
Then he would have said;

366
00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:22.873
Klip Anker Bay don’t give up.

367
00:25:27.356 --> 00:25:30.181
Don’t give up!

368
00:26:06.813 --> 00:26:08.280
Come. let's have a seat.

369
00:26:12.915 --> 00:26:16.482
I see we have some people
at the back. please. come in.

370
00:26:37.304 --> 00:26:38.925
It's good to see you.

371
00:26:39.071 --> 00:26:40.248
So. good to see you...

372
00:26:40.335 --> 00:26:42.728
Uncle Russell. you
may come forward.

373
00:26:46.125 --> 00:26:47.977
Alec was a good father.

374
00:26:48.966 --> 00:26:50.594
He was my best friend.

375
00:26:52.067 --> 00:26:53.817
But I just want to say that;

376
00:26:53.899 --> 00:26:59.433
I wish I could be
half the man he was.

377
00:27:01.873 --> 00:27:04.539
- No gentlemen. stop...
- Take it easy guys. calm down.

378
00:27:04.564 --> 00:27:06.665
Woah. woah. I won’t take long.

379
00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:08.944
Sorry people...
Sorry Minister...

380
00:27:09.412 --> 00:27:10.531
Reece.

381
00:27:11.636 --> 00:27:14.078
Sorry people but what I want...

382
00:27:17.919 --> 00:27:18.783
Alex.

383
00:27:20.526 --> 00:27:23.943
Sorry but what I want to say I want to
say here where everyone can hear me.

384
00:27:24.476 --> 00:27:28.649
Alec Donnay’s death
was not an accident.

385
00:27:29.313 --> 00:27:30.948
We know why he died!

386
00:27:30.973 --> 00:27:34.656
And we want to see
to it that justice is done.

387
00:27:37.327 --> 00:27:42.896
Some among us are
too scared. or too greedy.

388
00:27:43.016 --> 00:27:49.073
or too easily led to
resist the cheap offers

389
00:27:49.098 --> 00:27:51.001
we are being made for our boats

390
00:27:51.194 --> 00:27:53.005
and our quotas...

391
00:27:54.448 --> 00:27:57.061
But we must say no!

392
00:27:58.557 --> 00:28:00.187
We need to stand together.

393
00:28:00.613 --> 00:28:04.477
Alec Donnay was alone
when he stood up for our values.

394
00:28:04.573 --> 00:28:06.312
and our community.

395
00:28:06.469 --> 00:28:08.223
and he paid with his life!

396
00:28:08.248 --> 00:28:08.889
Julies!

397
00:28:09.159 --> 00:28:11.519
Take your rubbish
out of this church.

398
00:28:12.147 --> 00:28:17.808
We are here to lay a man
to rest not to listen to your politics.

399
00:28:17.833 --> 00:28:18.404
Out!

400
00:28:18.843 --> 00:28:20.923
Wait. wait...

401
00:28:23.501 --> 00:28:25.144
I’ve said what I wanted to say.

402
00:28:27.679 --> 00:28:29.849
Rest in peace Alec Donnay.

403
00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:41.597
Loved ones let us
remember why we are here.

404
00:28:42.493 --> 00:28:46.014
Let's stand and sing;
'The Lord is my shepherd'.

405
00:29:30.682 --> 00:29:32.473
What did the cops say. Reece?

406
00:29:32.928 --> 00:29:36.909
They didn’t find
anything suspicious.

407
00:29:37.529 --> 00:29:39.342
No sign of foul play.

408
00:29:39.708 --> 00:29:41.314
And what about
what Paul is saying...

409
00:29:41.548 --> 00:29:42.818
Paul...

410
00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:46.038
Is always looking for trouble.

411
00:29:47.274 --> 00:29:49.434
I really don’t know Alex.

412
00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:51.163
Where...

413
00:29:54.298 --> 00:29:56.206
Where did they find Daddy?

414
00:29:59.486 --> 00:30:01.247
I found him...

415
00:30:03.662 --> 00:30:06.903
On the rocks over at Seal Bay.

416
00:30:09.607 --> 00:30:11.599
I’m so sorry. Reece.

417
00:30:12.147 --> 00:30:14.036
We have lots to talk about.

418
00:30:15.763 --> 00:30:16.560
Maybe later?

419
00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:49.823
Here put those
plates down there.

420
00:30:51.039 --> 00:30:52.312
Mommy...

421
00:30:53.341 --> 00:30:54.460
Lexie...

422
00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:58.505
Let me see what you look like.

423
00:30:59.938 --> 00:31:01.876
We've missed you so much.

424
00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:03.693
I missed you too.

425
00:31:06.151 --> 00:31:08.087
I’m so sorry.

426
00:31:08.742 --> 00:31:10.457
You don't need to
saying sorry to me.

427
00:31:10.591 --> 00:31:11.748
He’s your father.

428
00:31:12.368 --> 00:31:13.599
My brother. yes...

429
00:31:14.241 --> 00:31:15.753
But your father.

430
00:31:16.006 --> 00:31:19.719
And you better stop with
all this English nonsense...

431
00:31:20.006 --> 00:31:23.277
I’ll try Aunt Baby. I promise.

432
00:31:23.428 --> 00:31:25.895
Come and help with
the cups and saucers child.

433
00:31:26.113 --> 00:31:29.229
The whole community is coming.
the people loved your father very much.

434
00:31:29.314 --> 00:31:31.035
- We'll talk later.
- Okay.

435
00:31:34.577 --> 00:31:37.458
I need to know what
your decision is Reece.

436
00:31:38.905 --> 00:31:40.944
I told you. Uncle Henk;

437
00:31:41.756 --> 00:31:42.881
I haven’t decided yet.

438
00:31:44.565 --> 00:31:45.714
I need more time.

439
00:31:46.756 --> 00:31:47.499
Time...

440
00:31:47.645 --> 00:31:48.779
Is running out...

441
00:31:49.093 --> 00:31:51.538
The offer can’t just
hang there forever.

442
00:31:54.871 --> 00:31:56.210
We’ll talk later.

443
00:32:06.753 --> 00:32:10.143
I take it you were trying
to get Donnay on board?

444
00:32:11.639 --> 00:32:14.364
He is stubborn...
Like his old man.

445
00:32:15.647 --> 00:32:17.427
But he will come around.

446
00:32:18.848 --> 00:32:22.950
Well you need to speed things
up. the boss is getting very impatient.

447
00:32:23.813 --> 00:32:25.923
Speed things up?

448
00:32:27.241 --> 00:32:29.812
Twenty five boats.
with concessions.

449
00:32:29.837 --> 00:32:31.035
By next week.

450
00:32:34.223 --> 00:32:36.054
Twenty five boats?

451
00:32:36.738 --> 00:32:37.755
Next week?

452
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:42.998
You may as well ask
for a trip to the moon.

453
00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:46.659
The offer's not just going to...

454
00:32:47.542 --> 00:32:49.859
Hang there forever.

455
00:33:05.489 --> 00:33:08.916
Yes. I'm telling you.
and so Alec said to me;

456
00:33:09.372 --> 00:33:12.832
'Don't let them say
that to you. Baby...'

457
00:33:13.367 --> 00:33:14.786
'Stand your own man!'

458
00:33:25.747 --> 00:33:26.642
Hey...

459
00:33:27.948 --> 00:33:28.988
Who is he?

460
00:33:29.519 --> 00:33:30.659
Who is who?

461
00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:33.649
The guy you’re writing
love letters to on your phone.

462
00:33:34.397 --> 00:33:35.002
Him.

463
00:33:36.119 --> 00:33:37.470
He’s my friend...

464
00:33:37.913 --> 00:33:38.918
Gustav.

465
00:33:39.615 --> 00:33:40.600
We dive together.

466
00:33:40.732 --> 00:33:41.852
Ah.

467
00:33:41.877 --> 00:33:42.543
Well...

468
00:33:43.903 --> 00:33:47.136
Why don't you tell him to meet
you outside and go for a walk.

469
00:33:47.594 --> 00:33:49.802
Everyone’s in here anyway.

470
00:33:50.467 --> 00:33:51.479
Really?

471
00:33:52.026 --> 00:33:53.441
I’ll cover for you.

472
00:33:54.335 --> 00:33:55.625
Thanks. Aunty Alex.

473
00:33:58.355 --> 00:33:59.270
'Aunty'?

474
00:34:02.006 --> 00:34:03.403
Then I was beaten all over...

475
00:34:03.951 --> 00:34:04.585
Everywhere...

476
00:34:08.964 --> 00:34:13.433
One can't really say things like that.
but my mom beat us with that broom.

477
00:34:18.578 --> 00:34:20.031
But that’s fine...

478
00:34:20.454 --> 00:34:21.010
For you. uncle Piet.

479
00:34:23.459 --> 00:34:26.922
We’re all in this together...

480
00:34:26.947 --> 00:34:30.876
You and I and the
fishermen. even the sack-men!

481
00:34:31.890 --> 00:34:36.616
These people want to destroy
our way of life. that's the...

482
00:34:36.641 --> 00:34:38.785
Lexie. I just wanted to say...

483
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:39.872
No Paul!

484
00:34:39.897 --> 00:34:42.532
I want to tell you
that. I can help.

485
00:34:42.853 --> 00:34:48.036
There’s trouble here and we
have to stop it. you and I together

486
00:34:48.068 --> 00:34:51.158
Tomorrow. we’ll talk
when you’re sober. okay?

487
00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:54.413
I just want to say one thing;

488
00:34:54.464 --> 00:34:55.721
you look great!

489
00:34:56.745 --> 00:35:01.357
Uncle Piet. did you know
we dated at high school?

490
00:35:01.775 --> 00:35:03.125
Us...

491
00:35:03.795 --> 00:35:08.393
Alex. can we please have some alone
time? I just want to clear some things up.

492
00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:09.875
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

493
00:35:09.914 --> 00:35:12.047
What you gonna dance your
way through an explanation?

494
00:35:12.205 --> 00:35:13.974
Come let’s dance. man!

495
00:35:14.007 --> 00:35:15.134
- When was the last time we danced?
- C’mon Paul.

496
00:35:15.159 --> 00:35:16.069
Don’t be like that...

497
00:35:16.094 --> 00:35:19.176
- I’m not in the mood.
- Just a quick one...

498
00:35:19.201 --> 00:35:20.480
Quickly...

499
00:35:20.593 --> 00:35:22.635
They'll need to
turn up the music.

500
00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:24.009
Paul. no man!

501
00:35:24.034 --> 00:35:25.231
Let her go. you heard her.

502
00:35:25.256 --> 00:35:27.400
Hey who are you?

503
00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.226
You bastard!

504
00:35:29.441 --> 00:35:31.968
What are you doing here?

505
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.400
You think I don’t
know you’re spying?

506
00:35:34.757 --> 00:35:39.193
Sniffing out information like
the bloody mongrel dog you are!

507
00:35:39.258 --> 00:35:43.513
You are trying to
kill this community.

508
00:35:43.685 --> 00:35:44.716
You...

509
00:35:45.505 --> 00:35:46.201
Hey!

510
00:35:47.816 --> 00:35:50.850
Hey. hey. hey. stop it now. Paul!

511
00:35:50.929 --> 00:35:52.580
- Wait man...
- Settle down.

512
00:35:52.605 --> 00:35:54.764
Hold on man. don’t
tell me what to do.

513
00:35:55.837 --> 00:35:57.394
I’ve left my beer.

514
00:35:57.717 --> 00:35:59.392
What the hell. David?

515
00:35:59.574 --> 00:36:01.114
So. what’s this all about?

516
00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:04.196
The so called accident.
the nice dinner. the...

517
00:36:04.634 --> 00:36:05.761
Are you stalking me?

518
00:36:05.914 --> 00:36:08.710
No. I had no idea you
were going to be here.

519
00:36:08.735 --> 00:36:10.630
Well. you know why I’m here.

520
00:36:10.759 --> 00:36:11.958
Why are you here?

521
00:36:12.401 --> 00:36:14.417
I work for an investment company.

522
00:36:14.475 --> 00:36:16.315
We’re here to pump money
into the community. so...

523
00:36:16.424 --> 00:36:18.472
Oh bull. David!

524
00:36:18.536 --> 00:36:22.287
'Pump some money in'. You
know I know what that means!

525
00:36:23.054 --> 00:36:26.479
So who is it? Amicus
Holdings? Pinnacle?

526
00:36:26.739 --> 00:36:27.554
Who?

527
00:36:28.027 --> 00:36:29.030
Gunther and Arkin.

528
00:36:29.099 --> 00:36:29.820
Ah!

529
00:36:31.786 --> 00:36:34.651
I thought you said:
'More rescue than asset-stripping'.

530
00:36:34.921 --> 00:36:36.125
- Yeah. right.
- Well. you asked.

531
00:36:36.265 --> 00:36:37.233
You asked...

532
00:36:37.778 --> 00:36:40.770
We have a bid on Allied
Fishing and I’m here to close that.

533
00:36:41.948 --> 00:36:43.927
Are you a good guy David?

534
00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.135
Can I trust you?

535
00:36:47.109 --> 00:36:48.401
Sorry. Aunty Alex...

536
00:36:49.249 --> 00:36:51.176
Aunt Baby says some
people want to greet you.

537
00:36:51.271 --> 00:36:53.009
- I’ll be there now.
- Okay.

538
00:37:12.886 --> 00:37:13.877
Hey.

539
00:37:14.307 --> 00:37:15.444
Can I sit with you?

540
00:37:16.553 --> 00:37:17.699
Sure.

541
00:37:21.029 --> 00:37:24.084
Paul always thinks
he knows what’s best.

542
00:37:28.006 --> 00:37:29.473
But it’s enough now.

543
00:37:30.588 --> 00:37:32.106
I’ve done my time.

544
00:37:33.895 --> 00:37:35.549
You're thinking of selling?

545
00:37:36.268 --> 00:37:37.555
Are you going to sell?

546
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:42.367
I’ve also done my time.

547
00:37:42.859 --> 00:37:44.044
With Mommy.

548
00:37:44.367 --> 00:37:48.159
C’mon Alex. it’s
not a competition.

549
00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:50.258
I know it was tough for you.

550
00:37:56.994 --> 00:37:59.327
It wasn’t tough. Reece!

551
00:37:59.647 --> 00:38:01.450
It was terrible.

552
00:38:02.326 --> 00:38:05.652
You and Daddy fishing. Daddy
busy with his community business...

553
00:38:05.721 --> 00:38:09.120
And me. alone with
Mommy watching her...

554
00:38:10.793 --> 00:38:12.589
He left the company to you.

555
00:38:15.863 --> 00:38:17.517
Well I don’t want it.

556
00:38:20.632 --> 00:38:23.218
Tomorrow I’ll be gone.
I have a deal to close.

557
00:38:24.654 --> 00:38:27.118
You must get it.
you are his son.

558
00:38:27.416 --> 00:38:28.978
you must get it.

559
00:38:29.717 --> 00:38:31.311
Continue his legacy...

560
00:38:36.234 --> 00:38:38.371
This is not my world
any more. Reece.

561
00:38:40.587 --> 00:38:41.901
I’m sorry.

562
00:38:42.259 --> 00:38:43.905
But you can have it all.

563
00:39:02.245 --> 00:39:06.120
You can go in anytime
you want to. Lexie.

564
00:39:27.607 --> 00:39:30.163
Daddy get this into your head.
I want to get away from here.

565
00:39:30.228 --> 00:39:32.117
You can go and
study in Stellenbosch.

566
00:39:32.295 --> 00:39:34.970
or Cape Town then you
can at least come and visit...

567
00:39:35.014 --> 00:39:36.198
I will come and visit.

568
00:39:36.376 --> 00:39:39.448
When I’m ready. When I know
that I won’t be swallowed up by this place.

569
00:39:39.729 --> 00:39:41.514
Lexie. your family needs you.

570
00:39:41.539 --> 00:39:42.654
Family?

571
00:39:43.304 --> 00:39:46.848
Daddy always thinks about
other people. we always come last!

572
00:39:46.943 --> 00:39:49.618
The community has to
pull together to survive. Lexie.

573
00:39:50.126 --> 00:39:52.131
Klip Anker Bay has to work together.

574
00:39:52.311 --> 00:39:54.673
And Alec Donnay
has to be the Messiah...

575
00:39:55.095 --> 00:39:56.737
Where has it got you. dad?

576
00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:02.186
I’m done with this place.

577
00:40:04.283 --> 00:40:06.145
Lexie. come on...

578
00:40:07.049 --> 00:40:07.784
Good luck.

579
00:40:07.914 --> 00:40:08.628
Lexie...

580
00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:11.103
Lex...

581
00:41:48.917 --> 00:41:49.917
That’s so little.

582
00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:51.955
Why don’t they stay out longer?

583
00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:52.428
Yes.

584
00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:54.328
That’s all the concession
allows these days.

585
00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:57.440
Little Alex...

586
00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:59.086
A lady now...

587
00:41:59.827 --> 00:42:00.546
Wow.

588
00:42:00.751 --> 00:42:01.751
Such a long time.

589
00:42:01.779 --> 00:42:02.788
Hi.

590
00:42:02.813 --> 00:42:04.760
Yes. good to see you.

591
00:42:05.293 --> 00:42:06.688
Sorry for your loss ma'am.

592
00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:08.229
Thank you. my brother.

593
00:42:08.581 --> 00:42:09.947
Let’s go.

594
00:42:16.013 --> 00:42:18.010
He left the sign
up all these years.

595
00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.445
Why didn’t you join him?

596
00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:28.889
It was always for
you. Alex. not for me.

597
00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:46.280
Thanks. Sash.

598
00:42:46.305 --> 00:42:48.587
I’ll send the management
accounts and everything.

599
00:42:48.808 --> 00:42:50.328
Thank you. really.

600
00:42:51.186 --> 00:42:52.186
No. no. no. no.

601
00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:54.177
I’ll be back in time!

602
00:42:54.291 --> 00:42:56.758
Mrs Moloi is still
my top priority and...

603
00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:59.760
Keep an eye on Clyde.
he's schmoozing Foster.

604
00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.688
Okay. I’ll call you later. bye.

605
00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.360
How bad is it?

606
00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.557
You tell me...

607
00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:16.340
And the community
have bought in?

608
00:43:18.246 --> 00:43:19.486
Most of them. yes.

609
00:43:20.321 --> 00:43:22.227
I am not here to stay Reece.

610
00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:24.987
I just came down for the funeral.

611
00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:27.253
I must go back to
my life in Joburg.

612
00:43:27.319 --> 00:43:29.036
This is not my fight!

613
00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:32.584
I must think.

614
00:43:34.424 --> 00:43:36.397
Yes. yes sir.

615
00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:39.850
I'm speaking to Kruger
tomorrow morning.

616
00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:45.561
No. I don't think everything will move
smoothly just because Donnay is gone.

617
00:43:46.981 --> 00:43:49.127
We’re experiencing
some push back.

618
00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:52.720
Yes sir.

619
00:43:53.212 --> 00:43:55.050
I will stay focused.

620
00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:57.129
Yes. I will keep that
momentum going.

621
00:43:57.154 --> 00:43:58.022
I will...

622
00:43:58.049 --> 00:43:58.770
Okay.

623
00:44:22.996 --> 00:44:24.602
Hey. Alex!

624
00:44:41.678 --> 00:44:42.678
You okay?

625
00:44:43.273 --> 00:44:45.087
I don’t know these
people any more.

626
00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:46.982
Of course you do.

627
00:44:48.226 --> 00:44:50.029
I don’t know how
things work around here.

628
00:44:50.054 --> 00:44:55.813
Except. that it’s a mess.
and now I have to try and fix it.

629
00:44:56.378 --> 00:44:57.378
Why you?

630
00:44:58.073 --> 00:45:00.180
Dad left his company to me.

631
00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:02.627
Your father was a wise man.

632
00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:06.213
If you need any
help just let me know.

633
00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:09.680
You?

634
00:45:10.319 --> 00:45:12.719
The snake in the grass
from Gunther and Arkin?

635
00:45:13.673 --> 00:45:17.066
I should be trying to foil your
plan to bring us to our knees.

636
00:45:23.514 --> 00:45:24.514
No...

637
00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:25.960
This is not good.

638
00:45:28.286 --> 00:45:29.731
Well. I quite like it.

639
00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:31.080
I mean...

640
00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:33.667
This is not something I do.

641
00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.453
I don't mix business
with pleasure.

642
00:45:37.493 --> 00:45:38.993
So you do like it.

643
00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:41.644
That’s a comforting.

644
00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:45.263
Sorry. David. I can’t...

645
00:45:45.446 --> 00:45:46.458
No wait. Alex!

646
00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:48.629
Alex.

647
00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:50.131
- Alex!
- Hello.

648
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:52.736
Paul?

649
00:45:53.197 --> 00:45:54.586
How did you get this number?

650
00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:17.513
Morning...

651
00:46:17.538 --> 00:46:18.667
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

652
00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:21.720
Not now Henk.

653
00:46:22.386 --> 00:46:23.755
All my guys are here.

654
00:46:24.146 --> 00:46:25.998
She’s in good nick Reece.

655
00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:29.225
A fresh coat of paint and
you’ll get a good price for her.

656
00:46:30.377 --> 00:46:32.110
But not what I’m offering...

657
00:46:33.306 --> 00:46:35.671
More people are
coming on board. Reece.

658
00:46:35.835 --> 00:46:39.062
You’ll have to jump
fast or you’ll be left out.

659
00:46:39.273 --> 00:46:41.879
Two days Donnay.
then I’ll move on.

660
00:46:50.947 --> 00:46:52.586
Nice place.

661
00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:56.210
I thought you were
going to be South Africa’s

662
00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:59.067
first coloured socialist president.

663
00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:00.347
Maybe I still am.

664
00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:05.015
Seriously. though. socialism
without capital is a tiger with no teeth...

665
00:47:05.539 --> 00:47:06.539
I'm an angry man...

666
00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:09.542
I’ve got to set the example.

667
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.112
Tell me what you
know about Allied.

668
00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:17.280
What is Henk’s game?

669
00:47:18.033 --> 00:47:19.939
He’s been buying
out the guys for years.

670
00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:23.396
Whenever they can’t put food on
the table. they he comes crawling in.

671
00:47:23.451 --> 00:47:25.210
and buys their boats
for next to nothing.

672
00:47:25.293 --> 00:47:27.192
He owns more than
half the harbour.

673
00:47:27.626 --> 00:47:28.626
And now he’s selling?

674
00:47:28.651 --> 00:47:29.546
Hmm.

675
00:47:29.586 --> 00:47:31.870
To a Mr Patch Gunther.

676
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.713
Owner of Gunther and Arkin.

677
00:47:33.753 --> 00:47:35.626
That Mhlatse guy works for him.

678
00:47:40.504 --> 00:47:42.371
Who killed my father. Paul?

679
00:47:45.273 --> 00:47:46.920
It wasn’t an accident. Lexie.

680
00:47:48.047 --> 00:47:51.772
If he just slipped and fell into the
sea. why was the engine switched off?

681
00:47:51.797 --> 00:47:53.207
Who would have done that?

682
00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:58.257
Meet me at my dad’s
house in an hour.

683
00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:00.007
If I’m going to make headway.

684
00:48:00.032 --> 00:48:01.762
I have to figure out
who’s in my corner.

685
00:48:13.953 --> 00:48:16.740
Woah! Woah! Woah!

686
00:48:18.126 --> 00:48:21.872
Unfortunately. it is true.

687
00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:26.395
The business has
not made a profit.

688
00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:31.473
My father was paying off a
number of loans and advances.

689
00:48:31.966 --> 00:48:33.515
Donnay company is in debt.

690
00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:37.112
Wait. wait. wait...

691
00:48:37.319 --> 00:48:40.691
So if Donnay’s bankrupt then
I might as well sell to Allied.

692
00:48:40.733 --> 00:48:44.475
Wow. Saaiman. Alec
was just buried yesterday.

693
00:48:45.399 --> 00:48:46.904
So. why not?

694
00:48:46.953 --> 00:48:48.391
Why not?

695
00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:51.483
Reece?

696
00:48:52.027 --> 00:48:53.678
If you sell to Allied...

697
00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:59.601
Then Henk decides what
boat and with who. you work.

698
00:49:00.285 --> 00:49:03.049
What is your suggestion. Alex?
What should the men do?

699
00:49:03.755 --> 00:49:05.616
Honestly. I don’t have the answer.

700
00:49:06.519 --> 00:49:08.527
But we know what
Allied is busy doing...

701
00:49:09.892 --> 00:49:11.892
Kruger is preying on this town.

702
00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:15.671
and he's going to sell us
out to Gunther and Arkin.

703
00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:18.904
I’ll never sell to that bastard.

704
00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:21.210
Sorry for my language.

705
00:49:21.546 --> 00:49:23.559
I must come up with a strategy.

706
00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:29.093
in the meantime I will
stay a few more days.

707
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.600
Are you all with me?

708
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:48.030
Aunt Baby.

709
00:49:48.055 --> 00:49:49.055
Hmm.

710
00:49:50.628 --> 00:49:52.308
Are you okay. Aunt Baby?

711
00:49:52.803 --> 00:49:55.816
Lexie. what are we going to do?

712
00:49:56.325 --> 00:49:58.444
I don’t know. Aunty Baby.

713
00:49:59.353 --> 00:50:01.727
From what I can see.
no-one’s doing anything illegal.

714
00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:03.800
But it’s so unfair!

715
00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:06.837
And what they are saying
about your father’s death.

716
00:50:07.215 --> 00:50:10.374
If there’s something wrong
there. the truth will come out.

717
00:50:10.518 --> 00:50:13.605
I hope so. my
child. I really do.

718
00:50:14.399 --> 00:50:16.919
Hi Aunt Baby. hi Alex!

719
00:50:16.984 --> 00:50:18.380
Hey.

720
00:50:18.446 --> 00:50:19.887
Aren’t you going to work?

721
00:50:19.964 --> 00:50:21.644
Afternoon off. Aunt Baby.

722
00:50:25.053 --> 00:50:26.413
Want to hang out?

723
00:50:29.522 --> 00:50:30.575
Why not...

724
00:50:31.911 --> 00:50:32.924
I’ll just change.

725
00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:34.035
Cool.

726
00:51:16.726 --> 00:51:18.160
Very impressive.

727
00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:22.170
How was it?

728
00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:24.569
Brilliant. thanks Aunty.

729
00:51:24.818 --> 00:51:26.518
We’re coming back tomorrow.

730
00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:28.459
We found something
interesting under the water

731
00:51:28.484 --> 00:51:30.245
but then Gustav ran out of air.

732
00:51:30.313 --> 00:51:31.655
What is it?

733
00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:33.412
Not sure.

734
00:51:34.026 --> 00:51:35.473
Looks like a very old rowing boat.

735
00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:38.797
but not with wood. with skins.

736
00:51:38.846 --> 00:51:40.479
That’s interesting.

737
00:51:41.372 --> 00:51:42.372
Sorry...

738
00:51:44.706 --> 00:51:45.706
Hi...

739
00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:48.120
You've what?

740
00:51:48.982 --> 00:51:50.662
Something to show me?

741
00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:54.523
Okay. I’ll be there shortly.

742
00:51:54.753 --> 00:51:55.367
Bye.

743
00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:59.368
Come on... I'll drop
you at the dive shop.

744
00:51:59.468 --> 00:52:00.487
Let me help you.

745
00:52:00.512 --> 00:52:01.512
Thank you Alex.

746
00:52:03.139 --> 00:52:04.139
There we go...

747
00:52:17.312 --> 00:52:18.390
Thanks.

748
00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:22.065
So. what do you have for me?

749
00:52:22.344 --> 00:52:23.977
Not so fast...

750
00:52:24.219 --> 00:52:26.887
The info I have comes with a price.

751
00:52:27.254 --> 00:52:28.411
And the price is...

752
00:52:29.225 --> 00:52:31.092
You have to let
me cook you dinner.

753
00:52:37.025 --> 00:52:38.025
David.

754
00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:42.794
I have two days to sort things out
before my boss expects me back in Joburg.

755
00:52:42.865 --> 00:52:44.344
I don't have the time...

756
00:52:44.369 --> 00:52:45.369
Come on.

757
00:52:46.208 --> 00:52:49.161
Please take it easy. relax
and let me do this for you.

758
00:52:50.786 --> 00:52:52.209
I promise you won't
be disappointed.

759
00:52:55.099 --> 00:52:55.815
Okay...

760
00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:56.546
Okay.

761
00:52:58.979 --> 00:53:00.944
But then you're gonna
give me the info.

762
00:53:02.166 --> 00:53:03.166
Well...

763
00:53:31.846 --> 00:53:32.806
Okay...

764
00:53:33.239 --> 00:53:35.910
Impressive. you can
cook. I did not expect that.

765
00:53:40.609 --> 00:53:41.577
Mmm.

766
00:53:42.573 --> 00:53:46.056
Or that it would
be this good. damn!

767
00:53:47.454 --> 00:53:48.540
I'm glad you like it...

768
00:53:49.579 --> 00:53:52.889
So. what's the info Ratatouille?

769
00:53:53.574 --> 00:53:54.574
Hmm.

770
00:53:56.956 --> 00:53:58.466
He is coming down tomorrow.

771
00:54:00.955 --> 00:54:02.016
Then I want to speak to him.

772
00:54:04.238 --> 00:54:05.238
Umm...

773
00:54:05.676 --> 00:54:09.136
You know with Gunther.
it’s not about what you want.

774
00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:13.566
I’ll try and sort something out.

775
00:54:14.613 --> 00:54:15.280
Thank you.

776
00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:19.392
If I can just get the
measure of him. maybe...

777
00:54:19.451 --> 00:54:23.215
You know Alex. if it wasn’t
Gunther. it would be someone else.

778
00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:26.162
This is about progress.

779
00:54:27.298 --> 00:54:29.308
If this is progress. it sucks.

780
00:54:30.166 --> 00:54:32.894
C’mon Alex. you’re a realist.

781
00:54:32.919 --> 00:54:35.873
You can’t afford
to be sentimental.

782
00:54:37.921 --> 00:54:40.162
Probably the best thing
that could happen to this town

783
00:54:40.187 --> 00:54:42.709
is being forced into
the twenty-first century.

784
00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:45.495
We could build
something great here.

785
00:54:46.546 --> 00:54:47.732
Do you believe that?

786
00:54:49.548 --> 00:54:50.548
Hmm.

787
00:54:50.582 --> 00:54:51.462
Yes and no.

788
00:54:58.760 --> 00:54:59.760
What?

789
00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:02.500
You should be here.

790
00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:04.239
Building...

791
00:55:06.007 --> 00:55:06.780
Oh please...

792
00:55:13.411 --> 00:55:14.105
I mean it...

793
00:55:48.817 --> 00:55:50.072
What are you thinking?

794
00:55:55.573 --> 00:55:58.147
I told you about the woman
my mom worked for...

795
00:55:58.206 --> 00:55:59.957
Jessie. the anthropologist.

796
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:01.015
Hmm.

797
00:56:01.349 --> 00:56:02.349
Hmm.

798
00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:08.556
My community lost their
ancestral land to a casino.

799
00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:13.408
Jessie fought so hard.
she tried everything.

800
00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:16.400
But then she lost.

801
00:56:16.933 --> 00:56:17.815
And it killed her.

802
00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:23.489
I’m so sorry.

803
00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:28.456
I don't want that
to happen here.

804
00:56:33.723 --> 00:56:34.723
Hmm.

805
00:56:35.093 --> 00:56:36.093
Tell me...

806
00:56:37.267 --> 00:56:39.712
Where the heck did you
learn to cook like that?

807
00:56:41.982 --> 00:56:43.740
Every now and again I just...

808
00:56:44.527 --> 00:56:45.863
I like to indulge myself.

809
00:56:48.716 --> 00:56:49.886
Gunther...

810
00:56:50.006 --> 00:56:51.520
Tomorrow. okay?

811
00:56:51.931 --> 00:56:54.201
Gunther tomorrow... Yeah.

812
00:56:55.979 --> 00:56:58.378
Now indulge me.

813
00:57:22.186 --> 00:57:25.671
Mr Gunther. we need
time to assess the situation.

814
00:57:25.733 --> 00:57:27.570
This has all been very sudden.

815
00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:29.975
Well actually. it hasn’t.

816
00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:33.455
And this has been on the
cards for some time now.

817
00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:35.265
Look around you.

818
00:57:36.125 --> 00:57:37.432
The signs are all there.

819
00:57:38.013 --> 00:57:41.714
Unfortunately. your father
was too stubborn to see them.

820
00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:44.440
I hope you won’t be.

821
00:57:45.793 --> 00:57:48.245
Assuming. we are
open to negotiations...

822
00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:50.708
What do you propose?

823
00:57:53.533 --> 00:57:58.126
I think you are really
going to like this.

824
00:58:05.243 --> 00:58:07.576
Welcome to Newstone Waterfront.

825
00:58:07.719 --> 00:58:09.661
The unspoiled coastal hideaway

826
00:58:09.705 --> 00:58:13.107
of South Africa’s most
successful professionals.

827
00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:26.180
I’m not really that
interested in fish. Ms Donnay.

828
00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:31.643
But I am interested
in the future.

829
00:58:33.246 --> 00:58:38.610
That’s where your family’s
house is. I believe. prime location.

830
00:58:40.538 --> 00:58:41.541
You can’t do this.

831
00:58:42.735 --> 00:58:43.634
Reece...

832
00:58:44.712 --> 00:58:46.729
You might say I already have.

833
00:58:47.826 --> 00:58:50.834
You are aware that
seven more boat-owners

834
00:58:51.052 --> 00:58:52.758
approached Henk Kruger.

835
00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:55.529
after we fetched
Vermeulen’s old tub?

836
00:58:55.969 --> 00:58:56.969
Seven?

837
00:58:57.653 --> 00:58:58.051
Hmm.

838
00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:01.560
Mr Gunther. I
appreciate your honesty.

839
00:59:02.059 --> 00:59:03.442
but I can assure you;

840
00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:06.088
the community is not gonna
roll over and play dead.

841
00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:10.183
I like your fighting
spirit. Ms Donnay.

842
00:59:11.267 --> 00:59:13.606
Thank you for playing
open cards Mr Gunther.

843
00:59:14.247 --> 00:59:15.853
If you’ll excuse us.

844
00:59:22.059 --> 00:59:24.449
This is not what I came
here to negotiate. sir.

845
00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:27.440
Big picture thinking.
David my boy!

846
00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:34.620
We really need to get you out of
this parochial little mindset of yours.

847
00:59:35.226 --> 00:59:37.300
I want you to invite the lovely locals

848
00:59:37.353 --> 00:59:40.886
to meet us this evening at the town hall.

849
00:59:41.293 --> 00:59:42.293
Yes sir.

850
00:59:42.733 --> 00:59:43.733
Good man.

851
00:59:57.790 --> 00:59:59.036
I need more time.

852
01:00:00.095 --> 01:00:02.763
If people would just give me
the opportunity to find a solution.

853
01:00:03.133 --> 01:00:06.020
and stop falling for the ‘I’m
throwing you a lifeline’ game.

854
01:00:07.747 --> 01:00:09.245
Oh. for goodness sake...

855
01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:10.411
What do you want?

856
01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:11.420
Lexie.

857
01:00:11.759 --> 01:00:13.247
Don’t be so rude.

858
01:00:13.453 --> 01:00:15.130
You are a snake
in the grass. David.

859
01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:17.571
- I know how this may...
- Look?

860
01:00:18.036 --> 01:00:20.071
I have no idea what you
think I can do for you.

861
01:00:20.151 --> 01:00:21.805
and your smarmy
Mr Patch Gunther.

862
01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:24.258
- But that business the other night...
- Will you please shut up a moment.

863
01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:25.094
and just...

864
01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:27.707
- I swear... I didn’t...
- No!

865
01:00:28.259 --> 01:00:29.820
I will not listen!

866
01:00:30.325 --> 01:00:33.450
I admit you had me
convinced. but it’s over!

867
01:00:35.318 --> 01:00:37.396
Do you know what you’re
doing to this community?

868
01:00:38.237 --> 01:00:39.714
To our families?

869
01:00:40.612 --> 01:00:41.841
To people?

870
01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:45.821
Now you can see what you’ve
built your career on. Alex. .

871
01:00:45.963 --> 01:00:48.820
You say that what
I’m doing is wrong.

872
01:00:49.211 --> 01:00:53.059
You’re hoping for partnership
at Foster Enterprises?

873
01:00:54.067 --> 01:00:55.669
You’re the hypocrite!

874
01:01:08.459 --> 01:01:10.427
Is it another new building?

875
01:01:11.461 --> 01:01:13.222
What are they
building apartments?

876
01:01:21.173 --> 01:01:23.663
Sorry... Sorry.... Excuse me...

877
01:01:23.688 --> 01:01:27.355
- Give me a moment. please.
- Sorry... Sorry...

878
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:33.916
Just give me a minute.

879
01:01:34.678 --> 01:01:38.352
Thank you for coming
here at such short notice.

880
01:01:39.716 --> 01:01:41.714
What do you want to
steal from us now. Kruger?

881
01:01:41.835 --> 01:01:43.239
Just a moment...

882
01:01:43.345 --> 01:01:45.901
- I only want a minute...
- Thank you...

883
01:01:45.933 --> 01:01:48.092
Thank you Henk...

884
01:01:49.249 --> 01:01:50.849
Let's get started...

885
01:01:52.052 --> 01:01:53.183
Welcome everyone.

886
01:01:53.325 --> 01:01:55.318
I’m Patch Gunther.

887
01:01:56.161 --> 01:02:02.210
and my company has just bought
Allied Fishing from Mr Kruger here.

888
01:02:07.618 --> 01:02:10.901
I thought I was going to be
investing in a fishing business.

889
01:02:11.054 --> 01:02:16.056
but when I came here to Klip
Anker Bay. I realised that...

890
01:02:16.214 --> 01:02:18.665
I'm investing in so much more...

891
01:02:18.866 --> 01:02:23.225
I don't know how many of you realise.
but you are sitting on a gold mine.

892
01:02:23.872 --> 01:02:25.316
Yes. a gold mine.

893
01:02:25.516 --> 01:02:28.355
And you can all. with our help...

894
01:02:29.996 --> 01:02:33.204
Excuse me people.
let me through please.

895
01:02:35.758 --> 01:02:36.726
Paul Julies.

896
01:02:38.697 --> 01:02:41.538
Let me interrupt you.

897
01:02:41.811 --> 01:02:44.525
on behalf of these people
that you are so eager to help.

898
01:02:45.353 --> 01:02:46.353
Right.

899
01:02:46.541 --> 01:02:51.506
My friends. if it looks
too good to be true.

900
01:02:51.828 --> 01:02:53.426
then I promise you it is.

901
01:02:54.409 --> 01:02:57.568
These people will say
anything to convince you.

902
01:02:58.451 --> 01:03:00.808
don’t be taken in.

903
01:03:02.587 --> 01:03:06.079
Alec Donnay tried to stand
up to them. so he was silenced

904
01:03:06.104 --> 01:03:08.184
Just like they are
trying to silence me...

905
01:03:08.589 --> 01:03:09.669
Do not sign anything!

906
01:03:09.867 --> 01:03:10.645
Don't sign anything.

907
01:03:19.565 --> 01:03:20.565
Leave!

908
01:03:26.667 --> 01:03:27.627
Don't...

909
01:03:27.909 --> 01:03:29.125
Leave him alone.

910
01:03:29.324 --> 01:03:31.474
- Julies. leave.
- Leave him!

911
01:03:32.436 --> 01:03:33.436
Paul.

912
01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:36.050
What the hell’s going on?

913
01:03:37.573 --> 01:03:38.536
They’ve got us. Alex.

914
01:03:39.139 --> 01:03:41.916
This isn’t an investment
in Allied Fishing.

915
01:03:42.248 --> 01:03:43.890
It’s a hostile takeover
of the whole town.

916
01:05:05.438 --> 01:05:09.813
Can anyone tell me whose land is on
the corner of Harder and Kinkel roads?

917
01:05:09.846 --> 01:05:10.926
It's Granny Hector's house.

918
01:05:11.309 --> 01:05:12.690
Granny Hector?

919
01:05:12.994 --> 01:05:15.559
Then Granny Hector
is looking at value of

920
01:05:15.584 --> 01:05:18.881
about four-hundred and
eighty three thousand rand.

921
01:05:18.975 --> 01:05:19.632
Wow!

922
01:05:19.709 --> 01:05:22.510
That’s nearly
half a million rand!

923
01:05:25.555 --> 01:05:26.992
Sir. you really can’t do this.

924
01:05:27.017 --> 01:05:29.070
these people don't understand
that property is worth more...

925
01:05:29.123 --> 01:05:32.265
I told you... Get on board or get out.

926
01:05:33.445 --> 01:05:34.526
Everyone!

927
01:05:34.551 --> 01:05:38.114
Allied Fishery is burning.
The fishery is burning!

928
01:05:48.090 --> 01:05:49.152
Gustav...

929
01:05:49.729 --> 01:05:50.717
Gustav. Gustav.

930
01:05:50.833 --> 01:05:51.833
Gustav.

931
01:05:53.523 --> 01:05:54.562
Gustav!

932
01:05:54.695 --> 01:05:56.960
Call the fire-brigade
Johan. do something!

933
01:05:57.005 --> 01:05:58.219
Uncle Henk what's going on?

934
01:05:58.244 --> 01:05:59.593
What's going on?

935
01:06:00.188 --> 01:06:03.029
My grandson.
Gustav. is up there.

936
01:06:03.074 --> 01:06:04.320
Uncle Henk. are you sure?

937
01:06:04.344 --> 01:06:07.912
Yes! That's where I saw
him last. up there in my office!

938
01:06:07.937 --> 01:06:09.246
- Gustav!
- You can't...

939
01:06:09.271 --> 01:06:13.028
- Look at all the smoke...
- No!

940
01:06:13.179 --> 01:06:14.345
Gustav!

941
01:06:17.136 --> 01:06:17.628
Paul.

942
01:06:17.986 --> 01:06:18.819
Paul!

943
01:06:19.438 --> 01:06:20.470
Paul!

944
01:06:35.169 --> 01:06:35.977
I’m going in...

945
01:06:36.023 --> 01:06:37.350
No. don't.

946
01:06:37.375 --> 01:06:39.882
This whole thing. Lexie.
it's all my fault. I'll be fine.

947
01:06:39.907 --> 01:06:41.017
- It's madness...
- I'll be fine.

948
01:06:41.057 --> 01:06:42.411
Don't. Paul!

949
01:06:48.687 --> 01:06:49.671
Gustav!

950
01:06:51.353 --> 01:06:52.211
Gustav!

951
01:07:02.190 --> 01:07:03.300
Gustav!

952
01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:06.994
Gustav!

953
01:07:10.413 --> 01:07:11.484
Gustav!

954
01:07:15.207 --> 01:07:16.254
Gustav!

955
01:07:17.084 --> 01:07:18.347
Gustav!

956
01:07:19.553 --> 01:07:22.299
Paul!

957
01:07:24.072 --> 01:07:27.675
Paul!

958
01:08:26.422 --> 01:08:27.452
Come. let's go.

959
01:08:28.835 --> 01:08:29.671
No.

960
01:08:33.268 --> 01:08:35.181
I need another day Louis.

961
01:08:35.324 --> 01:08:37.198
I have everything ready.

962
01:08:37.324 --> 01:08:41.602
I will work through the night
and send the brief in the morning.

963
01:08:43.325 --> 01:08:45.213
Sir. there's been another death.

964
01:08:46.074 --> 01:08:49.661
I just need one more day. could
you please just stall Mrs Moloi...

965
01:08:53.625 --> 01:08:55.701
I will fly tomorrow evening.

966
01:08:56.662 --> 01:08:59.179
Yes sir. I know. I know...

967
01:09:01.071 --> 01:09:03.250
Alex. are you okay?

968
01:09:04.872 --> 01:09:06.900
Just tell me you’re going
to stay for another few days.

969
01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:07.666
Reece.

970
01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:09.371
We must know what to do.

971
01:09:10.573 --> 01:09:14.733
I have decisions
that I need to make...

972
01:09:15.399 --> 01:09:19.221
I'm sorry brother. but I
don’t have all the answers.

973
01:09:45.845 --> 01:09:47.040
Lexie!

974
01:09:47.821 --> 01:09:49.717
Lexie there are people here!

975
01:10:03.787 --> 01:10:05.876
Let me understand this. Mr Gunther.

976
01:10:06.654 --> 01:10:07.629
Why me?

977
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:12.296
Well. I’ve been in the world long enough.

978
01:10:12.779 --> 01:10:15.462
to recognize leadership when I see it.

979
01:10:15.956 --> 01:10:17.762
So. what are you
proposing?

980
01:10:18.424 --> 01:10:21.551
I want you to convince the
people of this community.

981
01:10:21.950 --> 01:10:23.663
to sell their properties to me.

982
01:10:26.830 --> 01:10:27.672
Or?

983
01:10:30.465 --> 01:10:33.362
I really would hate
it to come to this.

984
01:10:33.535 --> 01:10:36.829
since Allied’s premises
are no longer satisfactory.

985
01:10:37.785 --> 01:10:42.207
I’ll be forced to move my twenty
five boats further up the coast.

986
01:10:42.476 --> 01:10:43.794
You can’t do that!

987
01:10:43.959 --> 01:10:46.444
My associate here. Mr. Faull.

988
01:10:46.689 --> 01:10:50.556
has been kind enough to
prepare some documents for us.

989
01:10:52.406 --> 01:10:55.079
It would seem your father
had been leading a conspiracy

990
01:10:55.134 --> 01:10:57.312
against Allied for some
time. Miss Donnay.

991
01:10:59.371 --> 01:11:02.359
These affidavits tell quite a story.

992
01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:08.014
There’s enough for me to
pursue a case of common purpose.

993
01:11:08.498 --> 01:11:11.268
that involves a lot of people.

994
01:11:13.315 --> 01:11:14.748
It’s quite simple.

995
01:11:15.518 --> 01:11:17.960
Either the people of this
community agree to work

996
01:11:17.985 --> 01:11:23.031
in a cooperative mutual
fashion with G & A.

997
01:11:24.218 --> 01:11:25.705
Or an adversarial one.

998
01:11:28.395 --> 01:11:31.601
Six pm tomorrow
afternoon. Miss Donnay.

999
01:11:32.998 --> 01:11:34.137
Your choice.

1000
01:11:35.924 --> 01:11:37.525
We’ll see ourselves out.

1001
01:11:47.711 --> 01:11:48.794
Four...

1002
01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:52.647
Four that said that they saw
Vernon Fortuin starting the fire.

1003
01:11:52.864 --> 01:11:56.038
But Vernon was with us. with
his father. those people are lying.

1004
01:11:56.096 --> 01:11:57.993
I know Katie. I know.

1005
01:12:00.647 --> 01:12:01.411
Rien...

1006
01:12:02.469 --> 01:12:04.417
It's was all our fault.

1007
01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:07.887
we should have just
told you we were diving.

1008
01:12:08.414 --> 01:12:09.446
No. Corinne...

1009
01:12:09.477 --> 01:12:11.675
We just wanted to see
what that old boat was.

1010
01:12:11.713 --> 01:12:14.460
but Gustav’s grandpa
was trying to phone...

1011
01:12:15.387 --> 01:12:17.046
And now Uncle Paul...

1012
01:12:18.891 --> 01:12:20.341
All for this!

1013
01:12:21.242 --> 01:12:24.813
Wait Rien. what is that?

1014
01:12:34.452 --> 01:12:36.083
Forced repossessions.

1015
01:12:36.253 --> 01:12:39.777
Possible murder. This is
not what I was hired to do.

1016
01:12:42.730 --> 01:12:44.809
David. David. David...

1017
01:12:46.354 --> 01:12:48.339
Don't be so naive.

1018
01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:51.805
If you want to get to the top.

1019
01:12:52.437 --> 01:12:54.964
you have to step on a
few people to get there.

1020
01:12:55.068 --> 01:12:59.596
We are taking away these people's
livelihood under false pretences!

1021
01:13:03.601 --> 01:13:04.808
What a waste.

1022
01:13:05.395 --> 01:13:09.520
I brought you on board
because I saw your potential.

1023
01:13:10.686 --> 01:13:14.132
I thought we shared a vision.
I thought you were good.

1024
01:13:14.636 --> 01:13:16.350
Then you tuck your
tail between your legs...

1025
01:13:16.375 --> 01:13:17.787
- I am good!
- Like a little puppy.

1026
01:13:17.945 --> 01:13:19.427
I have potential!

1027
01:13:20.297 --> 01:13:21.563
I'm not like you!

1028
01:13:21.603 --> 01:13:23.336
I don't want what you want!

1029
01:13:27.372 --> 01:13:28.158
You...

1030
01:13:28.864 --> 01:13:30.047
Are finished.

1031
01:13:30.872 --> 01:13:33.788
You will never work in
this business again.

1032
01:13:33.919 --> 01:13:34.809
Ever!

1033
01:13:39.645 --> 01:13:41.330
I'll see myself out.

1034
01:13:45.269 --> 01:13:46.345
That’s it...

1035
01:13:46.706 --> 01:13:50.190
Go run away. run
away little puppy!

1036
01:13:56.522 --> 01:13:57.620
Aikemma.

1037
01:13:58.896 --> 01:14:00.955
My grandfather’s. grandfather.

1038
01:14:02.761 --> 01:14:05.516
He went on the sea. and...

1039
01:14:06.593 --> 01:14:08.467
The sea took him.

1040
01:14:09.533 --> 01:14:10.701
Are you sure?

1041
01:14:10.828 --> 01:14:12.844
Yes. Aikemma was a great leader.

1042
01:14:14.069 --> 01:14:15.934
These horns tell us;

1043
01:14:17.289 --> 01:14:22.133
he was the first
son. of a first son.

1044
01:14:23.246 --> 01:14:25.310
The Vaalribbok.

1045
01:14:25.786 --> 01:14:27.452
What does that mean dad?

1046
01:14:34.809 --> 01:14:37.650
When Aikemma comes
back from the sea...

1047
01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:42.114
The people will become strong again.

1048
01:14:45.281 --> 01:14:49.188
I should be back
in time. if not...

1049
01:14:49.298 --> 01:14:51.011
Stall as long as you can.

1050
01:14:51.036 --> 01:14:53.060
Just come back with
good news my child.

1051
01:14:53.754 --> 01:14:55.172
Have you heard from Reece yet?

1052
01:14:55.349 --> 01:14:57.312
Kim said he left
early this morning.

1053
01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:09.707
Corinne make sure
my flight is booked.

1054
01:15:12.830 --> 01:15:13.830
Go well.

1055
01:15:14.012 --> 01:15:15.123
See you later.

1056
01:15:15.193 --> 01:15:16.193
Okay.

1057
01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:25.920
Alex!

1058
01:15:26.473 --> 01:15:27.473
Wait. wait. wait...

1059
01:15:28.524 --> 01:15:29.923
Okay. what?

1060
01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:32.096
I told you I want to help.

1061
01:15:32.271 --> 01:15:33.931
There is nothing
you can you do.

1062
01:15:34.346 --> 01:15:36.108
and Gunther is not
going to listen to you.

1063
01:15:36.239 --> 01:15:37.621
I’m not with Gunther any more.

1064
01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:38.920
I left!

1065
01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:43.732
Well I have to be
somewhere. sorry.

1066
01:15:44.673 --> 01:15:47.316
Why couldn’t that
woman... Jessica.

1067
01:15:47.379 --> 01:15:49.730
Stop them building on
your ancestors land?

1068
01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:51.880
That was before...

1069
01:15:52.226 --> 01:15:54.490
There was no heritage
agency back then.

1070
01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.788
Thought so...

1071
01:16:03.311 --> 01:16:06.090
Thank you for seeing me at
such short notice. Mr Snell.

1072
01:16:06.363 --> 01:16:09.255
I haven’t got much time.
miss. I have a meeting to go to.

1073
01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:13.371
Mr Snell. there’s a village up the
West Coast... at Klip Anker Bay.

1074
01:16:13.433 --> 01:16:15.048
Developers are moving in...

1075
01:16:15.799 --> 01:16:18.951
We have to slow them down
before they destroy the community.

1076
01:16:19.153 --> 01:16:20.474
That's terrible.

1077
01:16:21.809 --> 01:16:25.335
You could apply for a
heritage overlay zoning.

1078
01:16:25.579 --> 01:16:28.014
but that’s a slow process...

1079
01:16:28.159 --> 01:16:30.665
What if I told you that was
found at the bottom of the bay

1080
01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:32.557
not far off the shoreline.

1081
01:16:33.946 --> 01:16:35.505
Odd. I agree.

1082
01:16:36.037 --> 01:16:38.237
But it doesn’t tell us anything.

1083
01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:42.406
It could be part of a
traditional headdress. or not...

1084
01:16:42.721 --> 01:16:44.480
And if it came
with a sunken boat.

1085
01:16:44.612 --> 01:16:47.449
a skeleton. and some
other Khoi artefacts?

1086
01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:50.879
Where did you say?

1087
01:16:57.912 --> 01:16:59.249
Aikemma.

1088
01:17:00.513 --> 01:17:02.974
The old man who
was taken by the sea.

1089
01:17:04.773 --> 01:17:06.879
It's extraordinary.

1090
01:17:19.681 --> 01:17:21.012
So will you help us?

1091
01:17:26.799 --> 01:17:28.626
Good choice Reece.

1092
01:17:29.032 --> 01:17:30.312
'New beginnings.'

1093
01:17:31.807 --> 01:17:36.057
The snoek runs from
here to Villiers Bay.

1094
01:17:36.226 --> 01:17:37.666
Too many to catch.

1095
01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:41.518
With the Lilly Marlene
we’ll catch them all.

1096
01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:43.800
Every single one!

1097
01:17:58.348 --> 01:18:00.321
Where did you get that?

1098
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.187
Bastard!

1099
01:18:50.749 --> 01:18:53.025
It's a fair fight. sea-rules.

1100
01:18:58.662 --> 01:19:01.282
It was an accident.

1101
01:19:01.353 --> 01:19:03.111
He fell overboard.

1102
01:19:04.226 --> 01:19:05.528
Accident?

1103
01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:09.423
My father fell overboard.

1104
01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:12.949
with necklace and all?

1105
01:19:13.239 --> 01:19:14.565
Like this...

1106
01:19:14.626 --> 01:19:15.822
No. no. no...

1107
01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:17.997
It was Johan.

1108
01:19:18.211 --> 01:19:21.272
Johan hit him too hard

1109
01:19:21.346 --> 01:19:24.079
and fell on the deck
and knocked his head.

1110
01:19:24.213 --> 01:19:25.384
I’m sorry. Reece.

1111
01:19:25.765 --> 01:19:26.765
I’m sorry.

1112
01:19:27.286 --> 01:19:29.225
I tried to make things better

1113
01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:33.669
by giving you more
money for your trawler...

1114
01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:36.639
Make things better?

1115
01:19:38.226 --> 01:19:42.005
You want to make things better?

1116
01:19:44.033 --> 01:19:47.192
Bring back my father!

1117
01:19:50.039 --> 01:19:52.593
Bring back my father!

1118
01:19:53.421 --> 01:19:56.640
Bring back my father!

1119
01:19:58.166 --> 01:20:02.259
Bring back my father!

1120
01:20:05.006 --> 01:20:07.002
Miss Donnay. please.

1121
01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:10.840
Those bones have probably
been there for centuries.

1122
01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:12.476
they’re not going anywhere.

1123
01:20:12.546 --> 01:20:15.936
I don’t want to keep you out of the
office longer than necessary Mr Snell.

1124
01:20:16.553 --> 01:20:18.477
That was the
arrangement. wasn’t it?

1125
01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:20.947
Oh. Lord. we're going to die.

1126
01:20:29.851 --> 01:20:31.304
Ladies...

1127
01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:38.857
Thank you. people.
thank you. silence please.

1128
01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:41.024
Thank you. thank you.

1129
01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:45.082
Our offer to you is very simple.

1130
01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:50.339
together we will
rebuild this town.

1131
01:20:51.133 --> 01:20:52.986
Progress!

1132
01:20:53.039 --> 01:20:54.673
Progress...

1133
01:20:55.013 --> 01:20:57.152
Will come through change.

1134
01:21:00.026 --> 01:21:02.938
But I’m not a patient man.

1135
01:21:03.866 --> 01:21:06.880
Mr Faull. has the
documents so...

1136
01:21:13.389 --> 01:21:14.395
What's happening?

1137
01:21:14.428 --> 01:21:15.748
What is this a circus?

1138
01:21:15.786 --> 01:21:18.678
We are having a meeting people!

1139
01:21:18.761 --> 01:21:20.615
We are having a meeting for...

1140
01:21:39.209 --> 01:21:40.987
Ladies and Gentlemen.

1141
01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:46.855
- Ladies and Gentlemen.
- My name is Jacob Snell.

1142
01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.412
And today we signed a
document to have your town

1143
01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:54.235
declared a heritage overlay zone

1144
01:21:54.280 --> 01:22:01.258
as a result of an exciting
archaeological find.

1145
01:22:04.825 --> 01:22:09.999
If Klip Anker Bay proves
to be of historical value.

1146
01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:12.663
and I think it will...

1147
01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:17.396
Then any development will
have to be carefully considered...

1148
01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:20.516
Where does that leave us?
We want to sell to Gunther...

1149
01:22:21.345 --> 01:22:23.859
Nonsense man. what if
we don’t want the zones?

1150
01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:28.585
Please. just listen...

1151
01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:31.270
The zoning just means
that our town will not

1152
01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:34.076
be bought out by rich outsiders.

1153
01:22:34.139 --> 01:22:37.398
and we get kicked out
as they did in other places...

1154
01:22:37.703 --> 01:22:39.103
Like Paternoster!

1155
01:22:39.257 --> 01:22:40.297
Mr Mhlatse?

1156
01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:45.506
Granny Hector’s land.
what is it actually worth?

1157
01:22:49.618 --> 01:22:50.618
Well...

1158
01:22:51.809 --> 01:22:54.406
The company I used to work for.

1159
01:22:54.668 --> 01:22:57.491
Is offering four hundred
and eighty thousand.

1160
01:22:57.516 --> 01:22:58.516
It's a good deal.

1161
01:22:58.654 --> 01:23:01.080
When in reality it's worth
four times that much...

1162
01:23:01.126 --> 01:23:02.126
That's a lie.

1163
01:23:07.117 --> 01:23:09.463
Progress. people

1164
01:23:09.888 --> 01:23:12.205
will happen here
at Klip Anker Bay...

1165
01:23:12.847 --> 01:23:13.784
I promise.

1166
01:23:14.677 --> 01:23:17.465
But not on their terms. on ours.

1167
01:23:21.090 --> 01:23:22.717
Mr. Gunther...

1168
01:23:24.503 --> 01:23:26.456
You are no longer welcome here.

1169
01:23:28.255 --> 01:23:30.565
I want an investigation on this.

1170
01:23:41.011 --> 01:23:42.291
How are you going to do this?

1171
01:23:42.918 --> 01:23:46.790
Gunther had all the funds and unless
you have a fairy godmother somewhere...

1172
01:23:48.473 --> 01:23:50.473
I think I may have a solution.

1173
01:24:10.852 --> 01:24:16.412
I think this belongs to you.

1174
01:24:31.714 --> 01:24:33.649
Aww...

1175
01:24:33.674 --> 01:24:35.586
Aunty Alex! Your flight...

1176
01:24:35.745 --> 01:24:38.509
Yes you must go.

1177
01:24:38.570 --> 01:24:41.366
I'm not happy about it
but you must hit the road.

1178
01:24:41.492 --> 01:24:44.440
Come. I'll take
you to the airport.

1179
01:25:08.017 --> 01:25:11.911
Mrs Moloi. you have so much to be
proud of about your father’s business.

1180
01:25:11.936 --> 01:25:16.372
He broke into black cosmetics
when no-one had even thought of it.

1181
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:18.847
He was a true pioneer.

1182
01:25:20.523 --> 01:25:23.625
Unfortunately. he failed to
future-proof the company.

1183
01:25:24.634 --> 01:25:28.795
He wanted to leave a legacy behind.
for you and his loyal employees.

1184
01:25:28.997 --> 01:25:33.091
But Black Silk has been
overtaken by fierce competitors. its...

1185
01:25:33.402 --> 01:25:35.481
Assets are shrinking.

1186
01:25:43.917 --> 01:25:46.123
What did you want to be
when you were growing up?

1187
01:25:46.427 --> 01:25:47.562
A business woman...

1188
01:25:47.623 --> 01:25:50.210
I wanted to be in
business like my father.

1189
01:25:53.278 --> 01:25:54.809
Mrs Moloi...

1190
01:25:55.813 --> 01:25:57.202
Do you want to liquidate?

1191
01:25:57.734 --> 01:25:58.536
No!

1192
01:25:59.339 --> 01:26:01.857
I want to fix this. I
want to make it work.

1193
01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:06.826
Then that’s what you should do.

1194
01:26:07.537 --> 01:26:09.291
Take a look at
what you’re worth...

1195
01:26:10.172 --> 01:26:12.811
You have the makings
of a viable business there.

1196
01:26:13.524 --> 01:26:18.345
Please go and talk to my PA. Sashi.
she will explain all the figures to you.

1197
01:26:25.946 --> 01:26:29.773
And here I was thinking you
were the future of Foster’s.

1198
01:26:31.026 --> 01:26:32.404
I'm sorry Louis.

1199
01:26:32.587 --> 01:26:34.952
I had a few things fall
into place for me this week.

1200
01:26:50.179 --> 01:26:51.427
You were right.

1201
01:26:53.506 --> 01:26:54.202
Come.

1202
01:26:58.330 --> 01:27:00.557
What are you up to Donnay?

1203
01:27:02.714 --> 01:27:04.719
I have a proposition for you Louis.

1204
01:27:04.847 --> 01:27:05.727
Hmm.

1205
01:27:05.851 --> 01:27:10.452
How would you like to rebuild
an entire coastal community?

1206
01:27:17.797 --> 01:27:19.558
Explain...

1207
01:27:21.102 --> 01:27:22.514
Sashi. got to go!

1208
01:27:23.475 --> 01:27:24.602
- Thank you for everything!
- What's happening?

1209
01:27:24.642 --> 01:27:25.848
- What's going on?
- I’ll call you later.

1210
01:27:25.896 --> 01:27:26.951
- I love you.
- Okay then...

1211
01:27:26.977 --> 01:27:28.943
Love you too. okay...

1212
01:27:33.173 --> 01:27:33.941
And...

1213
01:28:29.168 --> 01:28:30.827
Here comes Alex!

1214
01:28:32.063 --> 01:28:35.717
Hey. welcome back stranger.

1215
01:28:39.019 --> 01:28:40.255
You're here!

1216
01:28:41.090 --> 01:28:42.458
I am Aunty Baby.

1217
01:28:44.031 --> 01:28:46.142
What we found is really
important. aunty Alex!

1218
01:28:46.167 --> 01:28:48.548
They’ve taken the bones and everything
to Cape Town. to the museum there.

1219
01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:50.763
I’m very proud of you. my girl.

1220
01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:58.329
Hey...

1221
01:28:58.424 --> 01:28:59.409
Hey...

1222
01:29:00.162 --> 01:29:01.129
You’re back.

1223
01:29:01.458 --> 01:29:02.716
How you doing?

1224
01:29:03.490 --> 01:29:04.662
More than well.

1225
01:29:05.744 --> 01:29:07.273
I bought Paul’s place.

1226
01:29:07.659 --> 01:29:08.826
His restaurant?

1227
01:29:08.921 --> 01:29:09.712
Yeah.

1228
01:29:10.121 --> 01:29:11.849
That’s wonderful!

1229
01:29:12.632 --> 01:29:14.884
We’re going to get this
village back on it’s feet.

1230
01:29:17.168 --> 01:29:18.072
Well...

1231
01:29:19.795 --> 01:29:21.433
I should leave
you to your family.

1232
01:29:22.567 --> 01:29:23.566
Cheers.

1233
01:29:26.616 --> 01:29:27.829
David!

1234
01:29:31.345 --> 01:29:35.020
In Joburg. I built
something. and it felt good.

1235
01:29:37.571 --> 01:29:38.659
I am glad for you.

1236
01:29:40.309 --> 01:29:41.082
Listen...

1237
01:29:43.079 --> 01:29:44.633
I want another chance.

1238
01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:46.470
With you.

1239
01:29:48.129 --> 01:29:50.478
I know I can be
difficult. closed off...

1240
01:29:50.828 --> 01:29:52.796
I can be stubborn. but you...

1241
01:29:52.838 --> 01:29:54.402
You drive me crazy.

1242
01:29:55.532 --> 01:29:57.765
Crazy. in a good way.

1243
01:29:59.635 --> 01:30:01.028
I will change.

1244
01:30:02.403 --> 01:30:03.700
I want to change.

1245
01:30:04.395 --> 01:30:05.314
With you.

1246
01:30:07.644 --> 01:30:08.560
Do you trust me?

1247
01:30:10.256 --> 01:30:11.044
Trust you?

1248
01:30:12.071 --> 01:30:13.124
Yes...

1249
01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:15.986
Do you trust me?

1250
01:30:18.353 --> 01:30:19.091
No.

1251
01:30:21.226 --> 01:30:22.939
I think. I love you.
