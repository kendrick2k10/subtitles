(Phone rings)

4
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.083
Jodie. is that you?

5
00:01:00.417 --> 00:01:02.417
It's her. yeah?

6
00:01:02.708 --> 00:01:04.708
It's hard to tell.

7
00:01:04.917 --> 00:01:07.500
These are becoming really frequent now. I think it's a sign.

8
00:01:09.125 --> 00:01:11.458
Yeah. she's been gone a long time now.

9
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.375
Maybe she got it out of her system.

10
00:01:17.083 --> 00:01:21.375
Come on let's get you inside. getting cold out here. come on.

11
00:01:24.708 --> 00:01:31.958
In the build up to the anniversary of Jodie Bryant's tragic disappearance
of Brentwood Essex. Her parents have launched a fresh appeal for her return.

12
00:01:32.083 --> 00:01:35.250
Jodie Bryant was 14 years old at the time of her disappearance.

13
00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:41.750
She was last seen in school around lunch time. and it's thought she went
home to collect some belongings before heading to the train station.

14
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.042
With the exception of scattering of unconfirmed reports
around Essex. it seems that Jodie has just disappeared.

15
00:01:48.167 --> 00:01:52.667
Police have been unable turn anything up concrete since her disappearance.

16
00:01:54.375 --> 00:01:56.000
Someone must know something.

17
00:01:58.292 --> 00:01:59.917
Someone must have seen.

18
00:02:01.417 --> 00:02:03.042
Or be sitting with her right now.

19
00:02:09.708 --> 00:02:11.333
Or she could have died.

20
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.875
Or been killed.

21
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.125
Someone must know something.

22
00:02:20.083 --> 00:02:22.958
Contact the charity or the police anonymously.

23
00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.583
You don't need to give your identification.

24
00:02:27.208 --> 00:02:28.833
We would just like some answers thank you.

25
00:02:29.292 --> 00:02:33.458
Over the past year Sally Bryant has actively searched for her daughter.

26
00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:41.875
To many a familiar sight on the railway networks. She's often found
in railway stations or shopping centres at times a high profile campaign.

27
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.458
Mrs Bryant?

28
00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:05.333
Yeah?

29
00:03:05.542 --> 00:03:10.167
I'm Kevin I'm from the Essex Mercury.
I was sent by your solicitor to speak about Jodie?

30
00:03:10.708 --> 00:03:13.250
Right. so Clive sent you. okay come in.

31
00:03:18.292 --> 00:03:21.875
So. can you tell me about the day it happened?

32
00:03:25.333 --> 00:03:29.833
In the morning everything seemed fine. we had breakfast together.

33
00:03:29.917 --> 00:03:31.917
Jodie went to school.

34
00:03:32.708 --> 00:03:34.958
My husband left for work. and I left for my work.

35
00:03:36.708 --> 00:03:38.708
When I came home. everything still seemed fine.

36
00:03:40.208 --> 00:03:42.208
But she never came home.

37
00:03:43.875 --> 00:03:45.875
When did you realise something was wrong?

38
00:03:46.875 --> 00:03:50.833
I called around five. and I heard her phone ringing upstairs.

39
00:03:50.875 --> 00:03:51.958
She's a teenager.

40
00:03:53.083 --> 00:03:55.083
Teenagers takes their phones everywhere. so

41
00:03:55.833 --> 00:03:57.833
Immediately I knew something was wrong.

42
00:04:00.667 --> 00:04:02.667
Do you think she disappeared on purpose?

43
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.750
Oh fuck I don't know.

44
00:04:08.167 --> 00:04:09.708
Sorry.

45
00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:13.125
What do you think happened?

46
00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958
I think she thought she was an adult.

47
00:04:19.417 --> 00:04:21.417
And its likely caused her to run away.

48
00:04:23.208 --> 00:04:25.208
Very shortly afterwards she realised she was a child.

49
00:04:29.792 --> 00:04:35.958
Threw weeks later. we started getting phone calls from local phone boxes.

50
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.250
Basildon. Orsett. Tilbury. Colchester.

51
00:04:39.583 --> 00:04:41.583
But she never withheld the number.

52
00:04:42.583 --> 00:04:45.167
I believe she was waiting for us to say something that

53
00:04:46.708 --> 00:04:48.458
Would make her come home.

54
00:04:51.792 --> 00:04:53.792
Do you think she's safe?

55
00:04:58.167 --> 00:04:59.583
I hope so.

56
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.667
Tell me about what you have done to bring her home.

57
00:05:06.292 --> 00:05:08.292
We've done everything.

58
00:05:08.708 --> 00:05:10.250
Everything.

59
00:05:14.125 --> 00:05:16.583
I now go to the town and hand out flyers.

60
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.250
And we did set up a charity.

61
00:05:22.042 --> 00:05:23.917
But. people forget.

62
00:05:24.792 --> 00:05:26.792
And we haven't had any donations for six weeks.

63
00:05:31.708 --> 00:05:33.708
How do you er. how do you feel?

64
00:05:35.167 --> 00:05:37.167
How do you think I feel?

65
00:05:38.292 --> 00:05:41.000
I'm empty. I'm destroyed.

66
00:05:42.667 --> 00:05:44.667
I just want my child back.

67
00:05:47.708 --> 00:05:49.708
If you could tell her one thing.

68
00:05:51.292 --> 00:05:53.292
What would it be?

69
00:05:56.583 --> 00:05:58.583
I'd tell her to come home.

70
00:06:02.917 --> 00:06:04.917
Just come home.

71
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.500
It doesn't matter we love her.

72
00:06:11.083 --> 00:06:13.083
Just come home.

73
00:06:24.208 --> 00:06:26.208
Hello? Is that Clive?

74
00:06:27.333 --> 00:06:29.083
Hello Clive. its Kevin.

75
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.500
I've made contact with Mrs Bryant

76
00:06:31.917 --> 00:06:34.708
Yeah. I'll try my best to help them find her.

77
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.500
I'll cover the story this week.

78
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.542
Okay thats good.

79
00:06:39.875 --> 00:06:41.875
Yeah I'll talk to you then.

80
00:07:56.417 --> 00:07:58.417
(Phone rings)

81
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:04.125
Hello? Yeah this is her.

82
00:08:07.583 --> 00:08:09.583
Your shitting me?

83
00:08:10.333 --> 00:08:12.000
Where?

84
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.167
It's definitely her?

85
00:08:15.042 --> 00:08:17.042
Sorry. where?

86
00:08:18.167 --> 00:08:20.125
Okay thank you.

87
00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:22.333
Girls. I'm sorry. I've gotta go.

88
00:08:23.125 --> 00:08:25.125
We had another sighting. sorry.

89
00:08:56.375 --> 00:08:58.375
(Phone rings)

90
00:09:06.792 --> 00:09:07.375
Hello?

91
00:09:07.417 --> 00:09:08.708
Hello Paul.

92
00:09:10.292 --> 00:09:11.583
Jules how's it going?

93
00:09:12.042 --> 00:09:16.125
Well you know. I'm not getting the money I should be. your two months behind.

94
00:09:16.875 --> 00:09:19.333
Yeah about that Jules I'm a bit skint at the minute mate.

95
00:09:20.208 --> 00:09:22.667
I'm in so much debt you know sally is still trying to find Jodie.

96
00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:26.583
To be honest I have no interest in your personal
arrangements what so ever.

97
00:09:26.875 --> 00:09:30.000
You have no issue with borrowing the money.
but it's always the same with people like you.

98
00:09:30.208 --> 00:09:32.208
Always reluctant to pay it back.

99
00:09:32.417 --> 00:09:35.542
No. its not like that mate. I just need a little bit more time.

100
00:09:35.625 --> 00:09:40.167
Times up. Paul. We had an agreement and you
have failed to keep to your end up of the deal.

101
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.250
Tell Sally to expect a visit.

102
00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:46.167
Jules please. Jules?

103
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.667
Jules?

104
00:09:48.875 --> 00:09:50.750
Julian?

105
00:09:55.417 --> 00:09:56.375
Fuck!

106
00:09:57.583 --> 00:09:58.583
Fuck.

107
00:10:37.208 --> 00:10:38.042
Fuck.

108
00:10:39.625 --> 00:10:41.625
It's payday Sally.

109
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:44.750
Debts must be paid.

110
00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:47.208
We had an agreement.

111
00:10:47.458 --> 00:10:51.875
But don't worry. I'm offering really easy payment.

112
00:12:22.708 --> 00:12:24.708
(Phone rings)

113
00:12:35.667 --> 00:12:37.083
Hello?

114
00:12:51.083 --> 00:12:53.083
Is this your daughter?

115
00:12:53.833 --> 00:12:55.833
No. No it's not.

116
00:12:57.333 --> 00:12:58.292
Are you sure?

117
00:12:58.458 --> 00:12:59.250
Yeah.

118
00:13:02.125 --> 00:13:05.167
I'm sorry to have put you through this Mrs Bryant

119
00:13:07.292 --> 00:13:09.292
She doesn't even look like the picture.

120
00:13:10.875 --> 00:13:17.583
Her hair. her skin. her freckles. don't you fucking
people check? You cant keep doing this to me.

121
00:13:20.542 --> 00:13:24.250
I'm awfully sorry Mrs Bryant she was considered a match.

122
00:13:25.625 --> 00:13:29.250
If she was black would she still be considered a fucking match.

123
00:13:29.625 --> 00:13:33.000
Nothing is the same. her height. her weight?

124
00:13:34.833 --> 00:13:36.833
I'm sorry I need to leave.

125
00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:46.250
We can't go on like this Paul.

126
00:13:47.375 --> 00:13:49.042
Like what?

127
00:13:49.333 --> 00:13:51.000
We need to go out.

128
00:13:51.833 --> 00:13:55.333
Go to the cinema. go for a walk. I don't give a shit.

129
00:13:56.583 --> 00:13:58.583
I can't live in this prison anymore.

130
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.750
We cant afford it Sal.

131
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
But we can't afford to be like this either.

132
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
We're just existing.

133
00:14:09.458 --> 00:14:11.125
I know.

134
00:14:14.875 --> 00:14:17.583
Do you know how long its been since we laughed.

135
00:14:19.042 --> 00:14:22.292
Watched a DVD or since you made love to me.

136
00:14:24.208 --> 00:14:25.875
I know.

137
00:14:27.417 --> 00:14:29.417
We have to face the facts.

138
00:14:29.708 --> 00:14:31.708
Look at me.

139
00:14:33.167 --> 00:14:35.167
She's either gone because she needed to.

140
00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958
Or she's dead.

141
00:14:49.083 --> 00:14:50.750
I know.

142
00:14:56.417 --> 00:14:58.417
Paul we can't do this anymore.

143
00:15:00.792 --> 00:15:02.458
I know.

144
00:15:05.292 --> 00:15:07.292
She's gone.

145
00:15:15.667 --> 00:15:17.042
I know.

146
00:15:17.167 --> 00:15:21.333
We have to move on today or its going to be the end of us as well.

147
00:15:23.375 --> 00:15:24.750
I know.

148
00:15:30.125 --> 00:15:34.167
I love you. so much.

149
00:15:38.333 --> 00:15:39.708
I know.

00:15:42.833 --> 00:15:46.208
Your right. we have to start again.

151
00:15:50.083 --> 00:15:51.458
I know.

152
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.000
Have you seen him over there?

153
00:16:39.125 --> 00:16:40.125
I know tell me about it.

154
00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:41.042
(She laughs)

155
00:16:43.375 --> 00:16:43.833
Do I look alright?

156
00:16:43.833 --> 00:16:45.250
Yeah you look good. Yeah.

157
00:17:09.375 --> 00:17:11.208
Seen you looking at me.

Sorry?

159
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.292
You want me don't you? You want me inside you.

160
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.458
Do I really?

161
00:17:17.458 --> 00:17:19.917
Yeah. You want it.

162
00:17:23.083 --> 00:17:24.542
You don't know what your talking about.

163
00:17:25.625 --> 00:17:30.958
You know I could make you feel so good and
its been ages since you felt good isn't it?

164
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:32.625
What would you know?

165
00:17:32.625 --> 00:17:36.583
I know what I see. and I reckon you want it.

166
00:17:36.875 --> 00:17:37.833
*Scoffs*

167
00:17:37.917 --> 00:17:39.167
Carry on kidding yourself love.

00:17:40.333 --> 00:17:43.000
Yeah. Your barking up the wrong tree darling.

170
00:17:43.208 --> 00:17:46.167
Good try though. little less direct next time.

171
00:17:46.333 --> 00:17:47.708
Oh so there will be a next time?

172
00:17:47.708 --> 00:17:48.667

173
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:49.625

I'm happily married.

176
00:17:55.292 --> 00:17:57.292
What in a sexless marriage.

177
00:17:58.542 --> 00:18:00.542
You think you know it all don't you.

178
00:18:00.708 --> 00:18:03.875
I know the face of a women who hasn't had a good fuck in years. yeah.

179
00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:09.958

180
00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.750
Hey we can make this whatever you want.

181
00:18:12.917 --> 00:18:17.333
But you want something. No. no. no. no you need something.

182
00:18:17.875 --> 00:18:19.875
Even if I only give your pussy a good rub.

183
00:18:20.417 --> 00:18:22.417
Fuck. you serious?

184
00:18:23.375 --> 00:18:24.917
What will it be love?

185
00:18:25.125 --> 00:18:28.833
I'll have a G&T thanks and whatever this cunt wants.

186
00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:31.250
Same again yeah?

187
00:18:32.125 --> 00:18:33.750
So you buying me a drink now are you?

188
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:38.833
Yeah. Because maybe with a bit of lubrication you might
find yourself with some better chat up lines.

189
00:18:39.167 --> 00:18:39.958
(Laughs)

190
00:18:40.333 --> 00:18:42.167
Lu-bric-ation.

191
00:18:42.167 --> 00:18:44.875
I'm up for a bit of that. how about you?

192
00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:46.667
I'm lubricated enough thanks.

193
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:48.750
So what we waiting for?

194
00:18:55.167 --> 00:18:56.792
Eight fifty please love.

195
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.667
He'll pay.

196
00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:00.750
(He laughs)

197
00:19:10.125 --> 00:19:12.125
What a dick.

198
00:19:14.292 --> 00:19:15.250
Men

199
00:19:31.875 --> 00:19:34.208
Ah bless. boyfriend chuck you out?

200
00:19:35.667 --> 00:19:37.667
You and I got some unfinished business.

201
00:19:38.208 --> 00:19:40.208
Come on no struggle.

202
00:19:40.625 --> 00:19:42.292
I just wanted to see what you would do.

203
00:19:42.583 --> 00:19:44.083
More than we currently are now.

204
00:19:44.083 --> 00:19:45.208
Like?

205
00:19:45.333 --> 00:19:46.417
I want to eat you.

206
00:19:46.625 --> 00:19:48.583
And I want a good hard cock.

207
00:19:48.583 --> 00:19:50.167
Then you might just get one.

208
00:19:50.875 --> 00:19:54.500
I said good and hard. What your packing is neither.

209
00:20:11.125 --> 00:20:13.125
Hello I'm Morris.

210
00:20:17.917 --> 00:20:20.667
We spoke about the Jodie Bryant situation on the phone.

211
00:20:21.375 --> 00:20:26.750
Before we move forward. Punctuality is very important
to me. do not make me ever wait for you again.

212
00:20:27.125 --> 00:20:29.125
Yeah traffic was terrible...

213
00:20:29.542 --> 00:20:34.208
Business are made and broken by attention to detail.
This includes making appointments.

214
00:20:34.375 --> 00:20:35.167
Understood.

215
00:20:35.417 --> 00:20:37.417
Good. shall we move on?

216
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.500
Do you have any issues regarding the work?

217
00:20:39.667 --> 00:20:41.667
No. Yes.

218
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.375
Why you interested?

219
00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:49.708
The girl's parents owe me a sizable debt. Getting her back will
enable them to be more together and pay what they owe.

220
00:20:50.167 --> 00:20:51.083
Is there a limit?

221
00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:59.500
No limits. Alive or dead. I need to know; I need this girl home either way.
Whatever it costs is whatever it costs. I'll add the debt to the Bryants' bill.

222
00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:01.375
Do I get to speak to mum and dad?

223
00:21:01.542 --> 00:21:08.208
No. everything available. you have. You are a private detective Morris. join the dots.

224
00:21:08.208 --> 00:21:13.417
I have none the less pulled in a few favours and you will have a hard
drive delivered to you today with all the police records.

225
00:21:13.625 --> 00:21:15.167
Ah now.

226
00:21:16.042 --> 00:21:20.417
I know thats lovely and everything. but the thing is I
don't like to work with stolen stuff. dodgy stuff.

227
00:21:20.542 --> 00:21:26.000
You will work with whatever I proved you with or you wont work at all.
If you don't find this girls ill ensure you never work again.

228
00:21:26.625 --> 00:21:27.292
Yeah. but look.

229
00:21:27.458 --> 00:21:30.542
No buts Maurice. you claim to be the best in your field now prove it.

230
00:21:30.542 --> 00:21:38.500
If you do the job the police and media can't. you'll be the most in-demand private
investigator in the country. This could make you a very wealthy man. Maurice.

231
00:21:39.542 --> 00:21:42.167
Something I know certainly are not right now.

232
00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:45.625
My financial situation has bearing whatsoever on how good a job I do.

233
00:21:45.625 --> 00:21:50.042
But it helps. it helps being able to pay one's bills.

234
00:21:50.375 --> 00:22:00.500
I've asked around you Mr Sinclair I know your a hard man and that sort of stuff.
you don't muck about so I will be giving you benefit of the doubt.

235
00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:01.625
(He laughs)

236
00:22:01.625 --> 00:22:10.375
You are not in a position to give me benefit of the doubt. I earn a lot of money.
I give others the benefit of the doubt. nobody does this with me.

237
00:22:10.375 --> 00:22:14.208
This will be the making of you. Maurice. I just know it.

238
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:19.708
I'm going to need some working capital.

239
00:22:19.708 --> 00:22:23.417
It will be along with the hard drive. I take it £10k is enough?

240
00:22:23.625 --> 00:22:27.333
Find the girl; use every resource at your disposal. this has gone on too long.

241
00:22:27.417 --> 00:22:33.333
Be very aware Morris; fiddle the figures or fuck me over
and I'll make your life an absolute living hell.

242
00:24:46.125 --> 00:24:49.458
So she was like around for three to four days.
but John felt the need to move her on.

243
00:24:49.583 --> 00:24:50.750
Who's John?

244
00:24:50.833 --> 00:24:52.042
Our boss.

245
00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:56.042
What do you mean move her on?

246
00:24:56.042 --> 00:25:03.667
Well. either she's shit. or she's so fucking hot he had to move her onto the big hitters.
Thats like working with businessmen. celebrities. that sort of shit.

247
00:25:04.542 --> 00:25:05.833
Are you sure this is her?

248
00:25:06.042 --> 00:25:13.125
Look. I'd know her anywhere. she's the most professional amateur
I've ever seen. Took to it like a duck in water. Her name is Jo init?

249
00:25:13.417 --> 00:25:14.958
I don't know. Maybe?

250
00:25:15.958 --> 00:25:17.958
How do I get in touch with John?

251
00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:21.417
You don't. Look if knows I've spoke to you he'll break my face.

252
00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:25.750
Look. last year. when I got picked up by the filth. didn't say a word.

253
00:25:26.167 --> 00:25:28.167
But John broke four of my ribs anyway.

254
00:25:30.458 --> 00:25:36.458
Look. you can't just walk in there and talk to John. you need to get round him somehow.

255
00:25:38.167 --> 00:25:39.917
Alight. here is your money.

256
00:25:40.333 --> 00:25:41.417
Thank You.

257
00:25:41.833 --> 00:25:43.458
Don't spend it all in one place.

258
00:25:43.458 --> 00:25:45.917
You joking? I'm pregnant again. that's where this is going.

259
00:25:46.083 --> 00:25:47.250
How old are you?

260
00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:49.458
Good question. er sixteen?

261
00:25:49.542 --> 00:25:50.458
Really?

262
00:25:50.583 --> 00:25:53.500
Oh no I might be fifteen. I lose track of dates sometimes.

263
00:25:54.833 --> 00:25:56.833
Angel.

264
00:25:57.375 --> 00:26:02.125
Your a beautiful girl. you lovely. no. your lovely.

265
00:26:02.792 --> 00:26:06.417
Your really beautiful and really lovely. now listen.

266
00:26:06.583 --> 00:26:12.500
You got to find a way out of this. I mean you don't have to be doing
this you should be with someone else someone nice.

267
00:26:13.708 --> 00:26:17.667
It's easy to say when you have options.
When you get to my stage you don't have any options.

268
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:23.542
Options. you've got options. You see those fucking birds they
haven't got fucking options. they're in a fucking cage.

269
00:26:25.333 --> 00:26:27.333
I ain't got. you got options.

270
00:26:28.333 --> 00:26:29.750
So start again.

271
00:26:35.375 --> 00:26:41.500
My dad sneaked into my room when I was nine.
My life was ruined the day he touched me.

272
00:26:44.792 --> 00:26:46.167
Not everyone is disgusting.

273
00:26:46.167 --> 00:26:50.667
No they're not. not everyone is disgusting not everyone stinks.

274
00:26:52.042 --> 00:26:54.208
There some nice people out there and you should start meeting them.

275
00:26:54.708 --> 00:26:56.708
All you need is a break.

276
00:26:57.708 --> 00:26:59.708
You just need a good break.

277
00:27:01.708 --> 00:27:03.708
Are you blind?

278
00:27:04.042 --> 00:27:07.875
Do you walk around the street with your eyes closed?
There are scumbags everywhere.

279
00:27:07.917 --> 00:27:13.125
And all over the country in homes. parents are fucking
their children. all covering this sort of shit up.

280
00:27:15.083 --> 00:27:19.792
Look. just do me a favour alright? Next time your on the streets. take a good hard look.

281
00:27:19.792 --> 00:27:23.417
Life is shit. and when your out their you'll realise.

282
00:27:23.708 --> 00:27:25.708
It was nice to meet you.

283
00:28:51.083 --> 00:28:52.458
Sally.

284
00:28:52.458 --> 00:28:56.125
Sally. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

285
00:28:56.125 --> 00:29:00.667
So sorry. I'm so sorry baby. I'm so sorry. I'll talk to him alrlight. I'll sort this out.

286
00:29:01.542 --> 00:29:03.542
I can't do this anymore.

287
00:29:04.417 --> 00:29:07.583
It's been five days this week and my insides are hurting.

288
00:29:08.917 --> 00:29:10.417
How could you let it go this far?

289
00:29:10.417 --> 00:29:13.708
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'll sort this out. alright?

290
00:29:14.917 --> 00:29:17.958
I'll sort this. ill sort it.

291
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:09.750
You. what did you put through my letterbox.

292
00:30:10.042 --> 00:30:13.542
What are you doing you fucking nutter. nothing. what's a matter with you.

293
00:30:31.542 --> 00:30:32.917
Whats happening?

294
00:30:32.958 --> 00:30:34.958
Well you better have a look.

295
00:30:49.292 --> 00:30:51.292
Where did this come from?

296
00:30:51.583 --> 00:30:52.875
I don't fucking know do I Paul?

297
00:30:53.083 --> 00:30:53.875
Do you know what this means sally?

298
00:30:53.875 --> 00:30:56.750
Yeah. It's either her or some sick fuck is trying to blackmail us.

299
00:30:57.583 --> 00:30:58.250
We got to destroy this.

300
00:30:58.625 --> 00:31:00.375
No. Because it might be a sign.

301
00:31:00.667 --> 00:31:02.000
A sign we do not need.

302
00:31:02.167 --> 00:31:06.458
We know nothing more now than what we knew this morning.
What we do know is someone knows something about us.

303
00:31:06.792 --> 00:31:08.792
We got to get rid.

304
00:31:17.042 --> 00:31:19.333
(Phone Rings)

305
00:31:24.958 --> 00:31:26.208
Hello?

306
00:31:28.292 --> 00:31:29.542
Hello?

307
00:31:32.667 --> 00:31:34.417
Jodie is that you?

308
00:31:36.125 --> 00:31:38.125
Come home now yeah?

309
00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:41.250
I'll get you through this?

310
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.750
I need you home.

311
00:31:44.083 --> 00:31:45.833
We need you home.

312
00:32:14.333 --> 00:32:16.333
Working late again Paul.

313
00:32:16.667 --> 00:32:17.583
Yeah.

314
00:32:19.083 --> 00:32:20.292
Any news?

315
00:32:22.292 --> 00:32:24.125
No. nothing.

316
00:32:24.125 --> 00:32:26.125
It must be so hard.

317
00:32:28.875 --> 00:32:30.792
Well its certainly not easy.

318
00:32:30.792 --> 00:32:33.125
You know thats the most you've said to me in a year.

319
00:32:34.833 --> 00:32:35.958
Is it?

320
00:32:37.125 --> 00:32:39.125
I miss you.

321
00:32:40.583 --> 00:32:42.417
Yeah I miss me to.

322
00:32:42.417 --> 00:32:47.583
We need you back Paul. she may never come back?

323
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:49.750
We all miss you.

324
00:32:50.042 --> 00:32:55.208
Maybe its time to move forward. your both young enough you could start again?

325
00:32:58.542 --> 00:33:00.458
But we would have to adopt.

326
00:33:00.875 --> 00:33:05.375
Sally had to have a hysterectomy after Jodie they were complications.

327
00:33:09.375 --> 00:33:11.375
Fancy a cuppa?

328
00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:14.125
Nah I better get on.

329
00:33:14.792 --> 00:33:16.792
Oh come on.

330
00:33:23.875 --> 00:33:31.917
Now I never told you this they are redundancies due.
and your name is banded about. You need this job.

331
00:33:32.042 --> 00:33:32.958
Yeah.

332
00:33:32.958 --> 00:33:40.625
Well I've told them all about the overtime your doing put in a good word.
but I cant help you any further unless you help yourself.

333
00:33:41.042 --> 00:33:43.042
What do I need to do?

334
00:33:43.542 --> 00:33:48.042
You need to let go. Move on and up your game here.

335
00:33:52.417 --> 00:33:53.833
Yeah

336
00:33:54.042 --> 00:33:56.042
You can do it.

337
00:34:42.625 --> 00:34:44.333
So. Sally. tell me about your week.

338
00:34:44.583 --> 00:34:50.667
Usual work. stressed. random strangers shouting at me in the street.

339
00:34:51.583 --> 00:34:53.375
Normal week then?

340
00:34:53.875 --> 00:34:54.583
Hm.

341
00:34:54.583 --> 00:34:56.583
And sex?

342
00:34:57.708 --> 00:35:02.708
Still nothing. but I miss him. so much.

343
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.375
I'm starting to wonder if jodie was the only thing keeping us together.

344
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:10.000
Have you tried making the first move?

345
00:35:10.708 --> 00:35:14.958
Of course I have. dozens of times its fucking disastrous.

346
00:35:16.125 --> 00:35:18.542
Do you still suspect him of cheating?

347
00:35:19.542 --> 00:35:21.542
I don't think he's got it in him.

348
00:35:23.125 --> 00:35:24.958
I'm the one with the temptation.

349
00:35:24.958 --> 00:35:27.750
Really. tell me about it.

350
00:35:29.708 --> 00:35:36.875
I look around. I see it everywhere sex. romance. I
want sex. I want it in a loving way.

351
00:35:37.625 --> 00:35:39.458
I want to feel like a woman again.

352
00:35:39.458 --> 00:35:45.083
You need to talk to Paul. the only way you can
change is through clear lines of communication.

353
00:35:46.375 --> 00:35:48.333
I know but its hard.

354
00:35:48.333 --> 00:35:50.333
How you feeling about Jodie.

355
00:35:55.708 --> 00:35:57.708
I want to know why?

356
00:35:58.125 --> 00:36:00.125
It's killing us.

357
00:36:02.708 --> 00:36:05.458
I think we both know the answer to that Sally.

358
00:36:11.458 --> 00:36:14.958
I trust our conversations are always in confidence Doctor Spencer.

359
00:36:17.667 --> 00:36:20.125
Even if I wanted to say something I couldn't.

360
00:36:20.125 --> 00:36:23.042
Good. then you will remember that.

361
00:36:24.458 --> 00:36:30.583
Sounds like a threat Sally. you don't need to remind me of protocol.

362
00:36:52.458 --> 00:36:54.042
Hello Sally.

363
00:36:54.042 --> 00:36:55.333
Julian.

364
00:36:55.333 --> 00:36:56.583
It's pay day I'm afraid.

365
00:36:56.583 --> 00:37:00.625
Well I thought it might be. maybe try be a little nicer today. yeah?

366
00:37:00.833 --> 00:37:06.833
You owe me money I'm been more than nice. now get in the fucking house.

367
00:37:20.417 --> 00:37:27.542
This might be a little upsetting for you both. but you've got to see it.

368
00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:40.500
Is that your daughter on the photo?

369
00:37:43.458 --> 00:37:44.417
Yeah.

370
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:57.208
We have very good reason to believe that your daughter may well
be involved in a porn ring. that produce rape videos.

371
00:38:00.958 --> 00:38:06.458
Now I want you both to take your time. have a real good look. and tell me.

372
00:38:06.458 --> 00:38:09.792
Do you recognise any of the men in this photo?

373
00:38:10.167 --> 00:38:10.833
No.

374
00:38:12.458 --> 00:38:13.708
Mr Bryant?

375
00:38:17.583 --> 00:38:18.292
No.

376
00:38:18.667 --> 00:38:19.667
Look.

377
00:38:20.042 --> 00:38:23.667
I'm sorry to bring in this bombshell to your door in such a way.

378
00:38:24.542 --> 00:38:29.292
But this here give great hope hope that your daughter may still be alive.

379
00:38:30.042 --> 00:38:33.250
Which is a huge positive we must draw from this.

380
00:38:34.333 --> 00:38:36.000
Have you received anything?

381
00:38:36.833 --> 00:38:37.833
Nothing.

382
00:38:38.917 --> 00:38:40.917
Well we think you might.

383
00:38:41.333 --> 00:38:46.375
When information like this get leaked. Well there's purpose behind it.

384
00:38:47.208 --> 00:38:51.042
Well if we do then you'll be the first to know wont you.

385
00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:55.333
Much appreciated Miss. and I thank you both for your time.

386
00:38:58.167 --> 00:39:02.667
I can't imagine how difficult this must be for the both of you.

387
00:39:02.875 --> 00:39:07.083
I'll arrange a councillor to contact you as soon a possible.

388
00:39:07.833 --> 00:39:11.292
These things. well there best talked through.

389
00:39:12.542 --> 00:39:18.042
Well. good day to you both. and I'll be in touch. right.

Yeah?

393
00:39:59.167 --> 00:40:07.708
Morning sir. sorry for the inconvenience I'm from the gas board we've had reports
of a leak in the area. I've got to check all the properties. absolute nonsense innit eh?

394
00:40:09.417 --> 00:40:10.708
Well can you come back later?

395
00:40:10.792 --> 00:40:18.500
Now unfortunately sir. due to severity of the situation if I'm
not given immediate access. I'll have to call the police.

396
00:40:20.083 --> 00:40:21.083
(Scoffs)

397
00:40:21.375 --> 00:40:24.250
Fuck sakes. whatever come in and do whatever you got to do.

398
00:40:24.375 --> 00:40:25.917
Thank you sir.

399
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:37.750
So how do you know there's a leak then?

400
00:40:38.417 --> 00:40:40.417
Well there doesn't actually seem to be one.

401
00:40:42.667 --> 00:40:45.167
I don't suppose you've got any other properties in the area?

402
00:40:46.333 --> 00:40:49.292
Yeah. got a house up the street I rent out to a couple of girls.

403
00:40:49.583 --> 00:40:51.417
Oh yeah. what numbers that then?

404
00:40:52.208 --> 00:40:53.292
Thirty three.

405
00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:56.750
I should really check that out as well.

406
00:41:07.292 --> 00:41:07.750
John

407
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:14.583
Shit. Look ill just let you in yeah. The inlet is under the
kitchen sink and the boiler is in the bedroom at the front.

408
00:41:17.792 --> 00:41:21.375
Oh and stay out the bedroom at the top because Jo's asleep

409
00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:45.750
So you found what your looking for?

410
00:42:45.958 --> 00:42:46.750
Eh?

411
00:42:47.083 --> 00:42:48.292
Maurice.

412
00:42:48.583 --> 00:42:49.292
What?

413
00:42:49.292 --> 00:42:50.000
Huh?

414
00:42:50.542 --> 00:42:51.625
No

415
00:42:52.042 --> 00:42:54.042
I ain't got time for you bullshit games.

416
00:42:56.292 --> 00:42:58.292
I know who you are and what your up to.

417
00:42:58.708 --> 00:43:00.708
Your in way over your head little man.

418
00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:08.375
Don't want to spend the rest of your miserable days on a ventilator
and shitting in a bag I suggest you fuck off and stop following me around.

419
00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:09.458
Do you understand?

420
00:43:09.667 --> 00:43:11.042
I understand you.

421
00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:13.375
Well fucking do one then.

422
00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:31.917
Sally!

423
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:32.750
Guess what?

424
00:43:33.042 --> 00:43:33.958
What?

425
00:43:34.167 --> 00:43:35.167
No guesss you ain't going to believe it.

426
00:43:35.333 --> 00:43:37.000
Well I cant guess Paul.

427
00:43:37.417 --> 00:43:43.417
Ten people got made redundant today. but not me I got
a promotion. That promotion comes with a pay rise.

428
00:43:44.292 --> 00:43:47.208
A pay rise big enough to pay all of Julians costs.

429
00:43:50.417 --> 00:43:53.417
No more suffering it's all over. its all over.

430
00:43:53.417 --> 00:43:55.417
It's all over. I love you.

431
00:43:55.708 --> 00:43:56.583
Love you.

432
00:43:56.583 --> 00:43:57.833
Love you. I'll go see him now shall I?

433
00:43:57.833 --> 00:43:58.542
Yeah

434
00:44:15.208 --> 00:44:18.125
Ah Paul what an unexpected visit.

435
00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:19.292
I got good news.

436
00:44:19.333 --> 00:44:19.708
And?

437
00:44:19.833 --> 00:44:22.000
I've had a pay rise at work.

438
00:44:22.042 --> 00:44:24.083
That means I can make your monthly payments on time with interest.

439
00:44:25.708 --> 00:44:29.958
Well that is fantastic news. but you do know I need to be paid this month.

440
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.667
Please mate give me a break.

441
00:44:32.833 --> 00:44:36.083
I'm not totally unreasonable you know but
you do seem to have got off other lightly.

442
00:44:36.083 --> 00:44:40.042
Maybe. just maybe you could make the repayment this month?

443
00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:42.792
What do you want me to do?

444
00:44:43.917 --> 00:44:45.000
Same as Sally.

445
00:44:45.833 --> 00:44:46.292
What?

446
00:44:46.625 --> 00:44:48.583
You heard.

447
00:44:48.708 --> 00:44:49.833
Don't be fucking ridiculous.

448
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.917
Don't fucking talk to me like that you soppy cunt.

449
00:45:14.167 --> 00:45:21.917
Okay class and thats it. Don't forget on Monday
I need your essays on the pond life of urban gardens.

450
00:45:24.875 --> 00:45:26.875
Have a good weekend everybody.

451
00:45:52.792 --> 00:45:54.792
Pond life.

452
00:45:55.708 --> 00:45:57.000
Well that's appropriate.

453
00:45:57.542 --> 00:45:59.292
Haven't seen you in a while.

454
00:45:59.417 --> 00:46:01.875
Well you know.

455
00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:04.667
So how's things?

456
00:46:05.458 --> 00:46:07.792
We're moving on. who's the girl?

457
00:46:09.583 --> 00:46:10.708
Girl?

458
00:46:10.708 --> 00:46:14.208
Ah. her names Amy. What do you want?

459
00:46:14.667 --> 00:46:15.333
A chat.

460
00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:16.167
About what?

461
00:46:16.458 --> 00:46:17.250
Things.

462
00:46:17.667 --> 00:46:19.667
Well can you be a little bit more specific.

463
00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:25.500
I slept well last night. for the first time in over a year.

464
00:46:28.125 --> 00:46:30.125
How well do you sleep Tim.

465
00:46:30.583 --> 00:46:32.583
Like a baby.

466
00:46:33.625 --> 00:46:35.625
Like a baby?

467
00:46:36.292 --> 00:46:37.417
Just get to the point.

468
00:46:37.542 --> 00:46:39.083
I think I just did.

469
00:46:39.208 --> 00:46:40.583
What and thats it?

470
00:46:40.625 --> 00:46:42.208
Yeah.

471
00:46:42.958 --> 00:46:45.125
What do you want you cunt.

472
00:46:45.667 --> 00:46:48.625
Oh Tim. is that the best your going to do?

473
00:46:48.625 --> 00:46:50.625
What do you fucking want?

474
00:46:50.667 --> 00:46:55.833
I want nothing more than for you to know I exist. I will continue to exist.

475
00:46:57.583 --> 00:46:59.583
What and thats it?

476
00:46:59.625 --> 00:47:01.625
Yeah. like I said that's it.

477
00:47:02.167 --> 00:47:04.167
There's more to this.

478
00:47:06.875 --> 00:47:08.875
How do you feel Tim?

479
00:47:09.792 --> 00:47:11.792
How do you really feel?

480
00:47:12.708 --> 00:47:14.708
How do you mean?

481
00:47:15.792 --> 00:47:17.792
Do you miss us?

482
00:47:19.625 --> 00:47:28.208
I think of you often. but its all in the past we need
to move forward with our lives. separately.

483
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000
They can't get much more separate can they?

484
00:47:34.792 --> 00:47:39.250
Look you can't just turn up for the first time in ages and try to intimidate me.

485
00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:46.583
I've got responsibilities. I've got a career. You've got your own concerns.
so stick to your own life and stay out of mine.

486
00:47:47.542 --> 00:47:49.542
Our lives are intwined Tim.

487
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:54.167
What do you want you fucking bitch.

488
00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:57.792
You should know something.

489
00:47:58.125 --> 00:47:59.167
What?

490
00:47:59.333 --> 00:48:00.583
We've received stuff.

491
00:48:00.792 --> 00:48:01.833
Stuff?

492
00:48:01.958 --> 00:48:03.250
Yeah stuff.

493
00:48:03.333 --> 00:48:04.875
Be more specific.

494
00:48:05.875 --> 00:48:11.458
We received some DVD's with some very choice imagery on.

495
00:48:13.542 --> 00:48:15.542
Look after yourself Tim.

496
00:48:32.875 --> 00:48:34.875
What's the matter?

497
00:48:38.375 --> 00:48:40.375
I went to see an old friend today.

498
00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:42.500
A friend. friend.

499
00:48:45.833 --> 00:48:47.833
Who?

500
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.292
Tim Taylor

501
00:48:49.375 --> 00:48:51.375
What!

502
00:48:51.542 --> 00:48:53.542
I know.

503
00:48:58.917 --> 00:49:00.958
Do you not understand?

504
00:49:01.792 --> 00:49:04.625
We can't be the only ones to feel like this.

505
00:49:05.417 --> 00:49:08.917
We've suffered enough look. its time to share the burden.

506
00:49:09.292 --> 00:49:10.375
Don't see him again.

507
00:49:10.625 --> 00:49:18.458
I'm sorry. but all I can see is them swanning around living their
lives freely and knowing their part of the reason of why this happened?

508
00:49:18.625 --> 00:49:19.458
Sally. We have to...

509
00:49:20.417 --> 00:49:22.125
(Phone tings)

510
00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:27.250
Where's the phone sally?

511
00:49:31.917 --> 00:49:33.917
Hello?

512
00:49:34.292 --> 00:49:36.292
Is it her?

513
00:49:39.958 --> 00:49:42.750
She's gone. it's her.

514
00:49:44.083 --> 00:49:46.083
She put the phone down when she heard your voice. but.

515
00:49:46.375 --> 00:49:47.833
What did she say?

516
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.875
She said she loves us.

517
00:49:49.917 --> 00:49:56.458
She said she's sorry. and she said she's coming home.

518
00:49:57.667 --> 00:49:59.667
It's definately her.

519
00:49:59.958 --> 00:50:00.750
Yeah.

520
00:50:03.958 --> 00:50:05.958
I don't like it Paul.

521
00:50:07.792 --> 00:50:09.375
What do you mean?

522
00:50:10.167 --> 00:50:14.083
DVD's. Images and now a phone call.

523
00:50:14.833 --> 00:50:16.833
Somethings not right Paul.

524
00:50:19.667 --> 00:50:22.542
You really do see the darkness in everything.

525
00:50:24.167 --> 00:50:28.542
I see the reality. not pink fluffy clouds like you do.

526
00:50:28.958 --> 00:50:34.708
So man the fuck up. look beyond the end of your nose and sort it out.

527
00:50:35.125 --> 00:50:37.125
I told you somethings not right.

528
00:51:01.625 --> 00:51:03.333
Hi guys. how we doing alright?

529
00:51:03.417 --> 00:51:04.458
Yeah good. you?

530
00:51:04.583 --> 00:51:06.083
Done your homework?

531
00:51:07.208 --> 00:51:09.208
Don't forget pond life of urban environments.

532
00:51:15.208 --> 00:51:18.000
Alright. cheers for that. thanks for that. bye.

533
00:51:21.875 --> 00:51:23.875
What you got planned for this weekend then?

534
00:51:24.083 --> 00:51:26.958
Not really much really mate. I was thinking about taking that girl out from the bookies.

535
00:51:27.167 --> 00:51:28.417
Oh that blonde one.

536
00:51:28.542 --> 00:51:29.542
The skinny blonde one.

537
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:30.625
Skinny blonde one.

538
00:51:30.667 --> 00:51:32.333
Definitely a piece of me.

539
00:51:34.292 --> 00:51:36.125
This just came for you.

540
00:51:46.125 --> 00:51:47.667
You got to be shitting me.

541
00:51:47.833 --> 00:51:49.250
You alright mate?

542
00:51:49.375 --> 00:51:51.375
Take a look at these.

543
00:51:58.208 --> 00:51:59.500
One sec

544
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000
Wheres Kevin gone?

545
00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:27.167
Okay so as you can probably see he is a very powerful character.
Probably someone you really want to get on the wrong side of.

546
00:52:28.167 --> 00:52:33.208
Sorry can you just continue to read from page seventy eight
on your own. ill be back in one second.

547
00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:41.792
Hello there. can I help you?

548
00:52:41.833 --> 00:52:42.750
Mr Taylor?

549
00:52:42.750 --> 00:52:43.167
Yes?

550
00:52:43.208 --> 00:52:45.542
Hi. Kevin Donnelly from the Essex Mercury.

551
00:52:45.917 --> 00:52:47.917
I need to speak to you about something.

552
00:52:47.958 --> 00:52:49.958
Okay well I finish in about twenty minutes.

553
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:51.208
It can't wait really.

554
00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:53.667
Okay then. what's up?

555
00:52:53.667 --> 00:52:55.792
I've come into the possession of some images.

556
00:52:56.875 --> 00:52:57.667
Images?

557
00:52:57.875 --> 00:53:01.667
These are images of a man clearly having sex with an underage girl.

558
00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:08.417
And. how can I help you?

559
00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:10.333
Well. these images are of you?

560
00:53:12.208 --> 00:53:14.417
I'm sorry? What? This is ridiculous.

561
00:53:15.875 --> 00:53:17.125
Take a look yourself.

562
00:53:21.125 --> 00:53:23.792
Look these are indeed very unpleasant photographs but.

563
00:53:23.792 --> 00:53:27.375
what on earth. makes your sick little head think it was me?

564
00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:28.542
I like body art.

565
00:53:28.958 --> 00:53:29.333
And?

566
00:53:30.583 --> 00:53:35.625
Last week. news article. sponsored swim. your tattoo.

567
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:45.167
I think we better take these to the police. unless you
think we can come to some sort of arrangement?

568
00:53:45.375 --> 00:53:46.208
Why you here?

569
00:53:46.375 --> 00:53:49.958
I want the story. or I want a new car.

570
00:53:50.583 --> 00:53:52.750
Your a sick. sick man.

571
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.083
And you? Well I don't know what you are.

572
00:53:56.250 --> 00:53:59.917
Look. these images suggest but it doesn't imply anything.

573
00:54:00.333 --> 00:54:02.417
They're more graphic pictures.

574
00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:04.125
Get out of my way.

575
00:54:04.125 --> 00:54:07.167
So why your running away then. eh why?

576
00:54:10.167 --> 00:54:12.167
Your life's ruined now Tim.

577
00:54:12.417 --> 00:54:15.833
What you say now might go in your favour for the publics perception.

578
00:54:15.833 --> 00:54:18.125
Fuck perception and fuck you.

579
00:54:19.167 --> 00:54:20.583
I'm going to the police right now.

580
00:54:20.625 --> 00:54:22.625
Good now fuck off.

581
00:54:23.417 --> 00:54:25.250
Who was the girl?

582
00:54:25.417 --> 00:54:27.417
What do you expect me to say?

583
00:54:27.708 --> 00:54:29.583
Who and why?

584
00:54:31.708 --> 00:54:41.208
Her name's Amy. she's a student. why because I love her. its not wrong its just...

585
00:54:41.708 --> 00:54:44.917
I dont' want you to say anything you don't feel or believe.

586
00:54:44.958 --> 00:54:48.750
What the fuck do you care about what I want or what I feel.

587
00:54:49.083 --> 00:54:50.292
I want the truth.

588
00:54:50.458 --> 00:54:53.083
Truth? Where the fuck was your truth when you was asking for money.

589
00:54:53.542 --> 00:54:55.750
Don't run away cause you cant hide.

590
00:54:57.667 --> 00:54:58.542
Don't do it.

591
00:55:06.292 --> 00:55:06.833
Hello?

592
00:55:06.833 --> 00:55:09.208
Hi. Kevin Donnelley from the Essex Mercury.

593
00:55:10.375 --> 00:55:12.417
I've come into the possession of some images.

594
00:55:14.958 --> 00:55:22.250
Mate I'd rather install a toilet camera and look at myself straining to a bitter.
nasty stubborn shite. than watch you trying to pick up a bird again.

595
00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:24.250
And what's that suppose to fucking mean?

596
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.833
Can you not wait until their a little bit older.

597
00:55:27.042 --> 00:55:28.500
She said she was twenty.

598
00:55:28.667 --> 00:55:30.667
Twenty my fucking arse man.

599
00:55:34.458 --> 00:55:36.667
I should be knocking on your door and putting you away.

600
00:55:36.667 --> 00:55:38.625
You don't know what your missing mate.

601
00:55:38.625 --> 00:55:39.542
Maybe.

602
00:55:39.542 --> 00:55:41.500
Anyway watch and learn.

603
00:55:42.167 --> 00:55:44.167
This is how you deal with the likes of this.

604
00:55:52.625 --> 00:55:54.792
Do your fucking fly up man.

605
00:55:55.250 --> 00:55:56.000
We're professionals.

606
00:55:56.500 --> 00:56:00.042
Yeah. look front door is open. shall we go striaght in.

607
00:56:00.083 --> 00:56:01.500
No. stop.

608
00:56:02.250 --> 00:56:03.583
(Knocks on door)

609
00:56:04.208 --> 00:56:06.208
Let's see if he opens up first.

610
00:56:16.417 --> 00:56:17.833
Mr Taylor.

611
00:56:20.458 --> 00:56:22.708
Mr Taylor. police.

612
00:56:26.625 --> 00:56:28.292
Mr Taylor.

613
00:56:29.583 --> 00:56:31.167
(Knocks on door)

614
00:56:43.083 --> 00:56:46.333
Alright. we'll go In. but we'll go in slow right?

615
00:56:53.792 --> 00:56:56.750
No. no. shut the fucking door.

616
00:56:58.708 --> 00:57:00.417
(Screams)

617
00:57:18.417 --> 00:57:19.375
(Door bangs)

618
00:57:20.250 --> 00:57:23.292
This is what happens when you start dragging up the past Sally.

619
00:57:29.375 --> 00:57:31.250
It says he committed suicide.

620
00:57:31.250 --> 00:57:36.083
I never pressured him to do that. and how dare
you even think I could do something like that.

621
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.583
We know what your capable of.

622
00:57:38.583 --> 00:57:40.167
What does that mean?

623
00:57:40.958 --> 00:57:42.958
You know exactly what that means.

624
00:57:43.833 --> 00:57:45.833
I swear to you I never caused this.

625
00:57:47.250 --> 00:57:49.250
Maybe guilt just got the better of him.

626
00:57:49.917 --> 00:57:50.917
Maybe.

627
00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:58.375
Promise me Sally.

628
00:57:59.167 --> 00:58:00.583
I promise.

629
00:58:08.625 --> 00:58:09.250
Okay.

630
00:58:14.458 --> 00:58:15.083
Okay.

631
00:58:17.083 --> 00:58:17.708
Okay.

632
00:58:23.292 --> 00:58:25.250
Do you think I should call the police and tell them about Jodie.

633
00:58:25.833 --> 00:58:26.458
No.

634
00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:28.167
I don't think we should risk it.

635
00:58:29.833 --> 00:58:30.500
Okay.

636
00:58:31.458 --> 00:58:35.583
The media has died down. they're not actively looking.

637
00:58:36.917 --> 00:58:44.333
I say we wait until she comes home. listen to
her story. and then work out what to tell the police.

638
01:01:47.583 --> 01:01:49.042
(Knocks at the door)

639
01:01:54.708 --> 01:01:56.000
It's a bit early.

640
01:01:56.625 --> 01:02:03.000
Sorry to both you Mrs Bryant. I've been told to pop
by and ask you a few quick questions if thats okay.

641
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.875
Did you know a Mr Timothy Taylor.

642
01:02:08.083 --> 01:02:09.250
The guy from the paper.

643
01:02:09.250 --> 01:02:10.500
Aye thats right.

644
01:02:10.542 --> 01:02:12.167
No. I dont think I did.

645
01:02:12.458 --> 01:02:14.292
He was a teacher.

646
01:02:14.542 --> 01:02:17.833
Yeah I read that. but not at my daughters schools so why would I know him?

647
01:02:19.167 --> 01:02:20.542
Do you know if your daughter knew him?

648
01:02:21.417 --> 01:02:23.417
No of course she didnt. what a stupid question.

649
01:02:25.708 --> 01:02:27.542
Thanks very much for your time Mrs Bryant.

650
01:02:27.542 --> 01:02:29.542
We'll be in touch in a day or two.

651
01:02:29.625 --> 01:02:34.083
Thanks for your time? You've just come to my house
to ask me questions and now your going to leave?

652
01:02:36.167 --> 01:02:39.750
Sorry but if you know of no real connections just helps narrow down our enquiries.

653
01:02:39.917 --> 01:02:41.375
Why would their be a connection?

654
01:02:41.375 --> 01:02:45.542
I don't have all the details Mrs Bryant. that will be all for now.

655
01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:48.917
Right. I'll see you out.

656
01:02:49.125 --> 01:02:50.083
Alright.

657
01:03:07.167 --> 01:03:09.167
I've just had the police round.

658
01:03:18.250 --> 01:03:20.958
Hello my name is Leanne Johnson

659
01:03:21.333 --> 01:03:23.333
I heard you've been looking for a girl called Jo.

660
01:03:24.875 --> 01:03:26.875
I can give you information of where she is.

661
01:03:30.667 --> 01:03:32.125
Is that the girl?

662
01:03:33.250 --> 01:03:33.625
Yeah.

663
01:03:33.667 --> 01:03:34.000
You sure.

664
01:03:34.125 --> 01:03:34.750
That's her.

665
01:03:35.542 --> 01:03:36.125
So.

666
01:03:39.792 --> 01:03:41.458
Tell me about her.

667
01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:44.542
She turned up about a year. year and half ago.

668
01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:51.167
She was young. nieve looking. but she had a way about her.

669
01:03:52.083 --> 01:03:54.333
She knew what it took to satisfy a client.

670
01:03:54.333 --> 01:03:57.833
I've done this for six years and its not the kind of stuff I would do.

671
01:04:01.292 --> 01:04:02.625
What sort of stuff?

672
01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:08.042
Scat. fisting you name it. its yours

673
01:04:08.417 --> 01:04:12.292
But you also get good clients. just had to be prepared for any eventuality.

674
01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:14.375
I can't do that.

675
01:04:14.375 --> 01:04:21.125
If I got back to client room and he wants double
penetration with another party or parties.

676
01:04:21.250 --> 01:04:24.583
I'd have to step back. these people you can't step back from.

677
01:04:25.875 --> 01:04:27.208
Shes just a kid.

678
01:04:27.875 --> 01:04:29.542
Shes an adult she just looks young.

679
01:04:29.542 --> 01:04:31.708
No she's just a kid. shes fifteen.

680
01:04:33.542 --> 01:04:34.083
Fuck.

681
01:04:34.333 --> 01:04:35.000
Exactly.

682
01:04:35.833 --> 01:04:39.125
Look mate I'm not been funny but what sort of shit has this girl been through.

683
01:04:39.667 --> 01:04:42.375
The first time a bloke put a cock in my mouth I nearly passed out.

684
01:04:43.625 --> 01:04:45.625
She does some real hardcore shit.

685
01:04:47.042 --> 01:04:49.250
How does a fifteen year old girl get that fucked up.

686
01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:50.167
I dont konw.

687
01:04:52.667 --> 01:04:54.667
I think she was sexually abused by a teacher.

688
01:04:56.250 --> 01:04:58.250
Who recently committed suicide.

689
01:04:59.917 --> 01:05:01.542
You can't trust nobody.

690
01:05:01.542 --> 01:05:03.958
I left home when my step dad turned on me.

691
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
If I'm going to do that shit I want money for it.

692
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.625
But I'm sensible I own my own home. I've got kids.

693
01:05:10.708 --> 01:05:16.250
These two lives are separate. no body knows
what I do. and I only work up town or on the coast.

694
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:20.250
When you knew her. where was she?

695
01:05:20.833 --> 01:05:22.833
Knew her? I know her.

696
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
I know everything about her.

697
01:05:25.875 --> 01:05:28.792
I even know where she will be Tuesday night.
because that's divvy up day.

698
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:30.833
Where?

699
01:05:31.708 --> 01:05:33.000
Are you not forgetting something?

700
01:05:33.417 --> 01:05:34.083
What?

701
01:05:34.125 --> 01:05:39.167
The price. this information comes at you for a cost.
What is this worth to you?

702

709
01:06:11.917 --> 01:06:13.917

No seriously I think you two should get together.

741
01:07:54.292 --> 01:07:55.417
(Simone fakes a laugh)

742
01:07:55.667 --> 01:07:57.667
No. my mum would kill me.

01:09:03.292 --> 01:09:06.042
A million miles from offering to eat pussy in a pub.

So we are friends? But you know everything there is

01:14:35.292 --> 01:14:37.458
You've got nothing. nothing at all.

You're a client. she's a pro.

847
01:15:49.917 --> 01:15:51.417
The only issue will be if John comes with her.

848
01:15:51.625 --> 01:15:53.000
Does he do that

849
01:15:53.250 --> 01:15:55.125
You're a new client it's a possibility.

01:15:55.417 --> 01:15:57.417

889
01:18:22.167 --> 01:18:23.292

Carry On.

892
01:18:26.875 --> 01:18:29.667
If you don’t go home soon. things are going to get worse.

893
01:18:30.958 --> 01:18:35.625
They're in a lot of trouble they owe a lot of money.
Your dad has just been released on bail for attacking girls.

894
01:18:35.833 --> 01:18:37.292
I'm not ready yet.

895
01:18:37.417 --> 01:18:38.833
What you need time for?

896
01:18:39.167 --> 01:18:41.792

901
01:18:52.333 --> 01:18:54.500
Can I do anything to make it easier for you to go home?

902
01:18:55.042 --> 01:18:58.625
No. I just need time to think. I've already paid a visit briefly.

903
01:19:01.292 --> 01:19:03.083
Do you need any cash?

904
01:19:03.083 --> 01:19:04.708
No I do alright thanks. anything else?

905
01:19:04.875 --> 01:19:09.167
No. thats it. you just go home.

906
01:19:10.375 --> 01:19:12.542
Okay. so you need to stay here for at least ten minutes. alright?

907
01:19:13.542 --> 01:19:14.667
Why?

908
01:19:14.708 --> 01:19:17.667
Because this is how it works. I leave. the punter normally has a shower.

909
01:19:18.208 --> 01:19:24.708
Here look. take my card incase you need to reach me.

910
01:19:25.333 --> 01:19:27.333
And can I ask you one last question?

911
01:19:28.083 --> 01:19:28.667
Go on

912
01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:32.500
Why? Why did you go. why are you doing this?

913
01:19:33.292 --> 01:19:35.292
No reasons. just because.

914
01:19:37.083 --> 01:19:39.083
Anyway it's time to go.

915
01:19:48.083 --> 01:19:49.208
Maurice?

916
01:19:49.375 --> 01:19:51.375
You never looked like a Pete.

917
01:19:55.958 --> 01:19:57.083
Jodie?

918
01:19:57.083 --> 01:19:58.208
Yeah?

919
01:19:59.042 --> 01:20:00.417
Be safe.

920
01:20:00.583 --> 01:20:01.708
Always.

921
01:21:14.958 --> 01:21:16.125
(Phone rings)

922
01:21:32.375 --> 01:21:33.875
Fuck.

923
01:21:42.542 --> 01:21:43.917
Julian?

924
01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.958
Julian? What you got me into?

925
01:21:46.292 --> 01:21:48.000
Just do your job?

926
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:48.917
That poor girl.

927
01:21:48.917 --> 01:21:54.000
This is a world you do not understand Maurice. a world you won't want
to understand. Just do your job. and leave a richer man.

928
01:21:54.250 --> 01:21:55.458
She had kids.

929
01:21:55.917 --> 01:21:59.083
She was a whore. and now those kids have a better life.

930
01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:00.125
Yeah. I want out.

931
01:22:00.125 --> 01:22:05.417
Listen to me do you understand? You are in too far.

932
01:22:08.333 --> 01:22:11.500
We'll clean your car and return it to you in the morning.

933
01:22:12.708 --> 01:22:14.375
What about her?

934
01:22:14.833 --> 01:22:19.583
Every year people go missing. their fates never known.
she is just another statistic Maurice.

935
01:22:20.542 --> 01:22:23.708
Look. I've done everything you asked. I've passed on that message.

936
01:22:24.083 --> 01:22:29.667
Look. consider yourself on retainer. until Jodie comes home.
When she comes home our arrangement is at an end.

937
01:22:31.875 --> 01:22:32.917
Okay.

938
01:22:33.042 --> 01:22:38.417
Now go round the corner. and Serena. my driver.
will be waiting in my car. She will bring back your car tomorrow.

939
01:22:38.583 --> 01:22:39.333
Okay.

940
01:22:42.875 --> 01:22:48.833
Maurice. one last thing. Keep your mouth shut.
If you can do that then things will be okay.

941
01:23:02.333 --> 01:23:04.333
When did you get out?

942
01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:07.417
Late.

943
01:23:10.292 --> 01:23:14.375
And I've got to attend a police station at 6 o'clock everynight.

944
01:23:14.625 --> 01:23:19.292
Great. Well done. I dont know what goes through your fucking brain sometimes.

945
01:23:19.458 --> 01:23:20.875
Why didnt you come and see me?

946
01:23:20.875 --> 01:23:29.250
Because I don't want to be associated with a man who. for the last fourteen months.
since his own daughter went missing. has been attacking girls with similarities to Jodie.

947
01:23:30.167 --> 01:23:32.167
How did you even get out?

948
01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:35.333
Varied circumstances apparently.

949
01:23:35.833 --> 01:23:38.708
I've got to see a court appointed psychiatrist one day a week.

950
01:23:39.958 --> 01:23:41.958
What you being charged with?

951
01:23:42.125 --> 01:23:44.917
Four counts of assault. one attempted murder. I denied it Sally.

952
01:23:48.625 --> 01:23:49.833
You fucked up.

953
01:23:49.833 --> 01:23:53.000
I don't know why I did it? Pressure? Shit with Julian?

954
01:23:53.792 --> 01:23:56.208
Well you made the fucking press.

955
01:23:57.750 --> 01:24:01.625
Kevin. that reporter who's meant to be helping us is now working against us.

956
01:24:02.042 --> 01:24:04.042
And he thinks you murdered Jodie.

957
01:24:05.042 --> 01:24:06.000
Fuck.

958
01:24:06.458 --> 01:24:09.625
Yeah. I think its safe to say you wont be going back to work either.

959
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:15.625
Some bird range from the office? Simone. said
to contact her first before going back to work.

960
01:24:17.292 --> 01:24:19.292
Who is she?

961
01:24:20.833 --> 01:24:22.333
One of the admin girls.

962
01:24:22.583 --> 01:24:24.583
Then I suggest you give her a call.

963
01:24:24.667 --> 01:24:25.583
Okay.

964
01:24:25.917 --> 01:24:27.917
Sort it out Paul.

965
01:24:35.917 --> 01:24:39.167
I didn't know what else to say but at least I bought you some time.

966
01:24:39.875 --> 01:24:40.958
Thank you.

967
01:24:41.167 --> 01:24:44.542
When it goes to court though. its over.

968
01:24:44.875 --> 01:24:46.875
They give you a date?

969
01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:52.083
Referred for six weeks. could be anything up to six months.

970
01:24:52.667 --> 01:24:54.667
And have they given you an outcome.

971
01:24:55.042 --> 01:25:04.792
No. well. if the murder charge gets kicked out. I will probably
get a suspended sentence psychiatric assessment.

972
01:25:06.708 --> 01:25:09.375
I didn't try kill anyone Simone.

973
01:25:13.958 --> 01:25:15.958
I just miss my little girl.

974
01:25:17.458 --> 01:25:25.458
I don't know what to say Paul. I mean you think you know someone.
then something like this happens. Where do you go from here?

975
01:25:25.667 --> 01:25:29.042
I'm still the same. I'm still Paul.

976
01:25:31.292 --> 01:25:35.333
Right. well. lets go see the bosses.

977
01:25:44.708 --> 01:25:49.542

Donna. thank you very much.

980
01:26:07.125 --> 01:26:11.000
Safe for now. They even told me they'll help get around the curfew arrangements.

981
01:26:11.083 --> 01:26:16.333
I lied though Simone. I told them it was the first time. I denied all other times.

982
01:26:16.792 --> 01:26:20.208
Panicked didn't I can't be out of work.

983
01:26:21.167 --> 01:26:23.958
Alright. best you get home then.

984

01:27:06.792 --> 01:27:09.292

01:31:35.625 --> 01:31:37.583
Are you sure?

1054
01:31:37.583 --> 01:31:38.542
Yes.

1055
01:31:39.667 --> 01:31:46.375
Okay. On September twenty eighth. we were called to twenty seven
Western Road to investigate a case of child abuse.

1056
01:31:46.375 --> 01:31:54.250
The perpetrator committed suicide by elaborate means upon arrival.
When we searched his hard drive. we found a number of images.

1057
01:31:56.292 --> 01:31:58.292
Does this bring back any memories?

1058
01:32:12.625 --> 01:32:18.875
Listen Jodie. I know this is hard. but we have lots of
images of Mr Taylor with lots of different people.

1059
01:32:19.042 --> 01:32:24.083
We need to know how he got people to have
sex with him. and how you met him?

1060
01:32:24.458 --> 01:32:29.917
Jodie. if you want to leave all of this all in the
past and forget about it you can. okay?

1061
01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:39.042
If you don't mind me saying. Mr Bryant. you seem remarkably calm for a man
who has just discovered an adult has been having sex with his daughter.

1062
01:32:41.333 --> 01:32:46.250
My daughter has been missing for nearly 18 months and now shes home.

1063
01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:49.167
Obviously she left for a reason.

1064
01:32:51.208 --> 01:32:53.542
We might never understand what happened in that time.

1065
01:32:54.625 --> 01:32:56.625
Quite frankly I don't care.

1066
01:32:57.083 --> 01:33:00.625
That man is dead he cant hurt Jodie or anyone else.

1067
01:33:01.208 --> 01:33:04.125
So please. can we do this another time?

1068
01:33:04.208 --> 01:33:09.458
No. Mr. Bryant. we can't do this another time. you see. there are other images.

1069
01:33:09.875 --> 01:33:11.000
What?

1070
01:33:11.125 --> 01:33:13.125
Other images?

1071
01:33:15.167 --> 01:33:18.083
Jodie do you want to tell us anything?

1072
01:33:19.375 --> 01:33:20.083
No.

1073
01:33:38.708 --> 01:33:39.583
Whoa!

1074
01:33:39.708 --> 01:33:40.458
(They Laugh)

1075
01:33:40.625 --> 01:33:41.542
Shit the bed.

1076
01:33:41.833 --> 01:33:43.083

Well your daughters home. should you be with her?

1081
01:33:50.542 --> 01:33:52.542
No. she's catching up with her friends.

1082
01:33:53.250 --> 01:33:55.875
Oh. well it must be lovely to have her home.

1083
01:33:56.208 --> 01:33:58.333
Yes. Yes it really is.

1084
01:33:58.708 --> 01:34:00.708
I feel like that pressure is lifting a bit.

1085
01:34:04.542 --> 01:34:05.708
Okay. well I better get on with my work.

1086
01:34:05.708 --> 01:34:06.500

1096
01:34:49.708 --> 01:34:50.375
You shouldn't really be here.

1097

It's not what I've heard.

1143
01:37:54.375 --> 01:37:56.708
That's the sort of glib comment that we'll never be friends.

1144
01:37:56.708 --> 01:37:59.333
Glib. your ahead of your years.

1145

1179
01:40:58.792 --> 01:41:00.083

1180
01:41:00.583 --> 01:41:02.583

1181
01:41:02.625 --> 01:41:03.708

1183
01:41:10.875 --> 01:41:12.583
Now she wants it to carry on.

1184
01:41:12.667 --> 01:41:17.750
You do what you need to sweetheart. because we
need people on our side until your case is done.

1185
01:41:19.583 --> 01:41:20.417
Okay.

1186
01:41:31.833 --> 01:41:34.208
Do you want to see something that might lighten the mood.

1187
01:41:35.833 --> 01:41:37.083
What?

1188
01:41:38.750 --> 01:41:44.375
I got a disk. I thought it might spice things up
considering we haven't had sex in over a year.

1189
01:41:47.042 --> 01:41:48.625
A Jodie disk?

1190
01:41:52.750 --> 01:41:54.250
She agreed?

1191
01:41:54.583 --> 01:42:00.208
I didn't give her a fucking choice. we will have two new
disks by tomorrow and we can start uploading them.

1192
01:42:03.583 --> 01:42:04.625
Okay.

1226
01:45:22.292 --> 01:45:23.292
(They laugh)

1227
01:45:30.667 --> 01:45:32.667
(Door bell rings)

1228
01:45:34.542 --> 01:45:37.250
Sorry I forgot to mention I booked in another client for today.

1229
01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
That's six hundred quid she's made us this afternoon.

1230
01:45:42.250 --> 01:45:43.333
I don't want to do it.

1231
01:45:43.750 --> 01:45:45.750

01:45:52.333 --> 01:45:54.333
Hello Gary. nice to meet you.

1234
01:45:58.583 --> 01:46:00.833
Hi Maurice. so what you got?

1235
01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:04.250
Jodie. this is John.

1236
01:46:04.542 --> 01:46:05.375
Nice to meet you.

1237
01:46:05.458 --> 01:46:06.708
And you.

1238
01:46:06.708 --> 01:46:08.708
So what's the story?

1239
01:46:09.125 --> 01:46:13.333
I lost my job two months ago down the factory. my boss was Julian.

1240
01:46:13.708 --> 01:46:17.292
About four months ago he started picking on one of
our new kids; sixteen years old. just out of school.

1241
01:46:17.292 --> 01:46:18.625
Let me guess.

1242
01:46:18.750 --> 01:46:19.583
Shh.

1243
01:46:19.833 --> 01:46:24.333
Anyway. it's late one night and I'm getting out later than normal and I hear crying.

1244
01:46:24.333 --> 01:46:28.208
I look down one of the bits of plant and saw Julian trying to suck this kid off.

1245
01:46:28.208 --> 01:46:32.375
I pulled Julian off him and got the kid safe. The following
day we were called to a meeting and we were all made redundant.

1246
01:46:32.417 --> 01:46:34.417
Well theres a legal issue here.

1247
01:46:35.167 --> 01:46:39.000
He shut the factory down and rebranded it.
Doing the same thing but under a new name.

1248
01:46:40.625 --> 01:46:42.625
Well at least you spared another innocent. right?

1249
01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:47.292
No we never. three days later Julian got the kid at a nightclub and raped him.

1250
01:46:47.292 --> 01:46:51.458
The kid later withdrew his statement. but apparently has been spending a lot of cash.

1251
01:46:51.667 --> 01:46:52.875
So what can we help you with?

1252
01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:53.667
We want him.

1253
01:46:53.833 --> 01:46:54.458
Who?

1254
01:46:54.750 --> 01:46:56.750
Julian.

1255
01:46:57.958 --> 01:46:59.042
We can deliver him.

1256
01:46:59.292 --> 01:47:00.750
Or vice-versa.

1257
01:47:01.542 --> 01:47:02.375
Nice.

1258
01:47:08.417 --> 01:47:09.958
Good night Kevin.

1259
01:47:10.583 --> 01:47:12.583

1262
01:47:57.292 --> 01:47:59.292
About the pub stuff.

1263
01:47:59.375 --> 01:48:01.375
Yeah I thought you might be.

1264
01:48:03.792 --> 01:48:05.208
What was it you offered to do to me again?

1265
01:48:05.542 --> 01:48:10.875
Yeah look. was drunk I say stupid things when I'm drunk you know?

1267
01:48:14.167 --> 01:48:15.417
(They laugh)

1268
01:48:18.833 --> 01:48:20.833
No one has said anything like to me in years.

1269
01:48:21.875 --> 01:48:25.708
And if we were on our own. yeah I would have fucked you.

1270
01:48:28.417 --> 01:48:30.417
So what are we?

1271
01:48:31.417 --> 01:48:33.417

1272
01:48:36.042 --> 01:48:38.042

1281
01:49:23.958 --> 01:49:24.542

01:54:52.625 --> 01:54:53.875
Shit.

1388
01:55:42.042 --> 01:55:43.250
Jodie.

01:55:44.875 --> 01:55:46.167
Please to see me?

1390
01:55:46.292 --> 01:55:47.167

1391
01:55:47.542 --> 01:55:48.292
How's your tea?

1392
01:55:48.583 --> 01:55:49.875
Eh?

1393
01:55:49.958 --> 01:55:50.917

What have you done?

1396
01:55:58.792 --> 01:56:00.792
That should be a question for you don't you think?

1397
01:56:01.792 --> 01:56:09.208
It's a neuromuscular blocking agent. it's a paralytic. it takes days to wear off.

1398
01:56:09.375 --> 01:56:12.292
But all you can do now is sit and watch.

1399
01:56:12.375 --> 01:56:18.125
It's like been trapped in a prison. a bit like how I felt.

1400

1402
01:56:33.417 --> 01:56:38.792
Me and one of the boys thought we would come and
pay you a visit. because I know you like fucking people.

1403
01:56:40.708 --> 01:56:42.708
We thought you'd like a taste of your own medicine.

1404
01:56:43.625 --> 01:56:46.792
I'd say hold him down. but you can't move. can you?

1405
01:56:47.875 --> 01:56:49.875
You better go love.

1406
01:56:53.458 --> 01:56:55.917

02:02:10.458 --> 02:02:11.542

1455
02:02:11.750 --> 02:02:12.750

1457
02:02:25.542 --> 02:02:27.000

1458
02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
Take a look.

1459
02:02:38.667 --> 02:02:42.833
It's bad isn't it? It's even worst because you know how old she was.

1460
02:02:44.250 --> 02:02:45.458
You dirty little bastard.

1461
02:02:45.750 --> 02:02:48.792
Now. now Maruice I only wanted to be your friend.

1462
02:02:49.667 --> 02:02:50.708
What do you want?

1463
02:02:50.792 --> 02:02:52.792
Five. should do it.

1464
02:02:52.958 --> 02:02:54.708
Five? Five what?

1465
02:02:54.750 --> 02:02:56.375
Thousand.

1466
02:02:57.333 --> 02:02:59.333
And if I dont pay?

1467
02:02:59.542 --> 02:03:01.542
The images will go to the police.

1468
02:03:02.083 --> 02:03:04.500
My story. my paper.

1469
02:03:07.292 --> 02:03:12.625
I thought. with all these characters out of the way.
I might just see this world in a different way.

1470
02:03:14.542 --> 02:03:16.417
She's still out there.

1471
02:03:16.417 --> 02:03:20.458
I'm going to her next and I bet that will be a good pay off.

1472
02:03:21.708 --> 02:03:24.375
On that side. I can at least be happy. I suppose.

1473
02:03:25.833 --> 02:03:28.792
So then. what we going to do about this?

1474
02:03:41.250 --> 02:03:43.250
When did you realise whre the story was going?

1475
02:03:43.958 --> 02:03:46.458
About a day before the teacher was killed by jodie.

1476
02:03:47.167 --> 02:03:49.167
And you decided to just sit on it.

1477
02:03:49.292 --> 02:03:53.250
She needed protection. she trusted me.
You should never trust the press.

1478
02:03:53.625 --> 02:03:54.375
You're disgusting.

1479
02:03:54.708 --> 02:03:59.208
That's what the teacher said right before
he was killed. she had such an agenda.

1480
02:03:59.958 --> 02:04:01.958
I've obviously lived a very sheltered life.

1481
02:04:06.208 --> 02:04:09.000
So. cash or the cops?

1482
02:04:10.750 --> 02:04:11.583
Niether.

1483
02:04:11.875 --> 02:04:12.667
What?

1484
02:04:14.542 --> 02:04:16.292
Maurice. what are you doing?

1485
02:04:17.208 --> 02:04:18.833
I don't want to live in this world anymore.

1486
02:04:18.833 --> 02:04:20.708
Maurice. slow the fucking car down.

1487
02:04:20.708 --> 02:04:22.833
I don't want to be a detective. I want do a new job.

1488
02:04:23.125 --> 02:04:23.958
What you gonna do.

1489
02:04:24.125 --> 02:04:26.125
Fucking pest control.

1490
02:04:26.458 --> 02:04:28.125
We're going to go into a fucking wall.

1491
02:04:28.333 --> 02:04:30.333
(Car crashes)

1492
02:04:43.167 --> 02:04:45.833
Come on boys. daddy's got to go to work.

1493
02:04:53.750 --> 02:04:55.417

Yes.

1498
02:05:23.750 --> 02:05:25.750
I wish you were my mummy.

1499
02:05:29.667 --> 02:05:34.917
Well. I'd like that. and maybe I can be. what do you think?

1500
02:05:35.458 --> 02:05:36.458
Yeah.

1501
02:05:40.542 --> 02:05:42.542
(Door bell rings)

1502
02:05:43.792 --> 02:05:45.208
Excuse me.

1503
02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000

1504
02:06:03.333 --> 02:06:05.208
Hello Colin.

1505
02:06:06.917 --> 02:06:10.583
Your mum tells me you like tractors. and you've got hundreds of them.

1506
02:06:10.708 --> 02:06:13.000
Yes. and I have a massive one upstairs.

1507
02:06:13.458 --> 02:06:15.708
Really. why don't you show it to me then?
