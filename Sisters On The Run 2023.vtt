3
00:00:36.454 --> 00:00:38.820
How much
for that ticket?

4
00:00:38.914 --> 00:00:40.748
N-no. I-I need to
leave today.

5
00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:44.659
Um...

6
00:00:44.754 --> 00:00:47.496
Oh. wow. that's-that's
expensive. Um...

7
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.090
Uh. what's-what's
the cheapest ticket you got?

8
00:00:51.052 --> 00:00:52.134
And to where?

9
00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:56.055
Uh. yeah. okay.
Okay. what time?

10
00:00:58.893 --> 00:01:00.675
I-I'll need to come up
with the rest. Bob.

11
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.478
I'll be there. thanks.

12
00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:38.180
Selma.

13
00:01:40.476 --> 00:01:42.601
Where you at. Selma?

14
00:02:02.331 --> 00:02:03.872
I got you!

15
00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:23.142
Where the hell do you
think you're going.

16
00:02:23.227 --> 00:02:25.927
my sweet little Selma?

17
00:02:27.857 --> 00:02:29.931
I won't let you
do this to me anymore.

18
00:02:30.025 --> 00:02:31.433
You just wait a minute.
Selma. okay?

19
00:02:31.527 --> 00:02:33.602
-No.
-Baby. I'm your husband!

20
00:02:51.255 --> 00:02:53.839
By the way. I'm staying
the weekend at Carla's.

21
00:02:53.924 --> 00:02:55.924
Excuse me. are you
asking or telling?

22
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.593
Dad?

23
00:02:57.678 --> 00:02:59.636
I'm okay with it.
as long as your mother is.

24
00:03:01.223 --> 00:03:04.141
Thanks. Nolan. such a big help.

25
00:03:04.268 --> 00:03:06.801
You know how I feel about
Carla and her mother.

26
00:03:06.896 --> 00:03:08.520
Why can't you just
be cool about this?

27
00:03:08.606 --> 00:03:09.897
Dad's cool.

28
00:03:09.982 --> 00:03:11.973
Your father and I don't
work our butts off

29
00:03:12.067 --> 00:03:13.692
to put you through one of
the best schools in the state

30
00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:16.111
just so you can hang out
with some flunky

31
00:03:16.197 --> 00:03:18.480
who'll. let's face it.
become one of those sugar babies

32
00:03:18.574 --> 00:03:19.981
or whatever they're called.

33
00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:22.159
Let's just slow down a minute.

34
00:03:23.454 --> 00:03:26.413
Willow. who else will be there?

35
00:03:26.498 --> 00:03:28.207
Cindy and Rosa.

36
00:03:28.292 --> 00:03:30.158
Great. and I thought it
couldn't get any worse.

37
00:03:30.252 --> 00:03:31.960
Why do you have to be like this?

38
00:03:32.046 --> 00:03:34.504
I get good grades.
I don't get into trouble. ever.

39
00:03:34.632 --> 00:03:37.999
Willow. honey. I know it doesn't
seem like it. but I get it.

40
00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:40.677
I know how unfair life
can seem at 15.

41
00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:44.005
Just trust that I have your
best interests at heart.

42
00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.341
Plus. someone needs to enforce
the rules around here.

43
00:03:46.435 --> 00:03:48.727
Please. Mom.
just this one time.

44
00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:50.478
I'll even babysit for the
Johnson's like you asked.

45
00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:52.514
Showing initiative.
I like that.

46
00:03:52.608 --> 00:03:54.024
The answer is still no. Willow.

47
00:03:56.445 --> 00:03:57.861
I hate you.

48
00:04:01.283 --> 00:04:02.866
She doesn't hate you.

49
00:04:04.286 --> 00:04:06.286
I know. I push her hard.
it's just...

50
00:04:06.372 --> 00:04:08.622
She has so much
potential. Nolan.

51
00:04:08.707 --> 00:04:10.365
I won't let her waste it.

52
00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:11.750
I've seen it happen before.

53
00:04:11.835 --> 00:04:13.535
growing up in
an unstructured home.

54
00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.587
That's why I practically
kill myself

55
00:04:15.673 --> 00:04:18.039
trying to make sure everything
is perfect for this family.

56
00:04:18.132 --> 00:04:20.550
Maybe that's just it.

57
00:04:20.678 --> 00:04:23.553
You don't have to make
everything perfect. Madison.

58
00:04:24.682 --> 00:04:26.098
You're gonna be late.

59
00:04:38.988 --> 00:04:41.113
- Hey. you wanna drive?
- Yes!

60
00:04:44.368 --> 00:04:46.326
I hate you.

61
00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:07.589
I'm sorry. Selma.

62
00:05:07.683 --> 00:05:10.392
We have a three night
limits on the beds.

63
00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:13.094
I can call down to
Linden or Stonebrook.

64
00:05:13.188 --> 00:05:14.187
they should have room for you.

65
00:05:14.273 --> 00:05:16.431
No. th-that's okay. I. uh...

66
00:05:16.525 --> 00:05:18.099
I should find something
better. anyways.

67
00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:20.193
Can't keep bouncing
around like this.

68
00:05:21.405 --> 00:05:22.863
You gonna be okay. honey?

69
00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.450
Uh. yeah. yeah. I'll be okay.

70
00:05:28.746 --> 00:05:30.779
I got one option left.

71
00:05:30.873 --> 00:05:32.331
My family.

72
00:05:35.044 --> 00:05:36.117
Thanks.

73
00:05:57.775 --> 00:05:59.974
I think we.
as heads of the cheer squad

74
00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:02.277
need to take these issues
more seriously. Heh.

75
00:06:02.363 --> 00:06:04.613
Well. maybe if you spent
less time at the country club

76
00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:05.814
and more time...

77
00:06:05.908 --> 00:06:07.532
You try telling my husband

78
00:06:07.618 --> 00:06:08.992
to put down the golf club.
then we can talk.

79
00:06:10.788 --> 00:06:12.204
Uh. excuse me.

80
00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:22.964
Hey. big sis.

81
00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.216
Selma.

82
00:06:26.929 --> 00:06:28.169
What are you doing here?

83
00:06:28.263 --> 00:06:31.339
Uh. what's it been like.
eight. eight years?

84
00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:34.101
I stopped keeping track.

85
00:06:34.186 --> 00:06:35.644
Again. what are
you doing here?

86
00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:39.314
Um. yeah. I was headed out
West. maybe California.

87
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.609
So I just thought that...

88
00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:45.487
Uh. yeah. t-tr...

89
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:47.989
Truth is. I'm kind of in a jam.

90
00:06:48.075 --> 00:06:49.950
Surprise.

91
00:06:50.034 --> 00:06:52.193
Yeah. well. this time
it's different. Um...

92
00:06:53.622 --> 00:06:55.864
I-I really need help.

93
00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:57.916
Can't wait to hear this one.

94
00:06:58.001 --> 00:07:00.201
So. all those other times
you came to me for help

95
00:07:00.295 --> 00:07:02.504
with all the lying and the
stealing. those don't count?

96
00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:04.214
Just this one?

97
00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:06.341
Please. I'm all ears.

98
00:07:06.427 --> 00:07:08.176
You know what?
Just forget it.

99
00:07:08.262 --> 00:07:10.178
Uh. this was a mistake.

100
00:07:10.264 --> 00:07:12.639
You are absolutely right.
it was.

101
00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:17.686
And if you find yourself
at this door again.

102
00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:19.187
I won't open it.

103
00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:45.839
Can I help you. gentlemen?

104
00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:47.382
You've seen her?

105
00:07:50.846 --> 00:07:52.554
Figure she might have
been along this way.

106
00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:54.422
You're from out of state.

107
00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:56.016
To give out any information.

108
00:07:56.101 --> 00:07:58.593
I'll need the local
authorities present with you.

109
00:07:58.687 --> 00:07:59.978
for the safety of the woman.

110
00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:01.429
You're aware of this.

111
00:08:01.523 --> 00:08:03.148
We don't have time
for this. Mickey.

112
00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:05.567
Excuse Ajax.

113
00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:08.436
He's very passionate
about helping people.

114
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.772
Now you want what's best
for the woman. am I right?

115
00:08:10.866 --> 00:08:13.867
So what do you say. help us out?

116
00:08:13.952 --> 00:08:16.786
I say you can come back
with the local P.D.

117
00:08:16.914 --> 00:08:19.789
and the appropriate papers.
and I'd be happy to help you.

118
00:08:19.917 --> 00:08:21.666
And we completely understand.

119
00:08:21.752 --> 00:08:22.951
My partner and I are only
looking out

120
00:08:23.045 --> 00:08:24.619
for her best interest.

121
00:08:24.713 --> 00:08:26.379
I promise.

122
00:08:26.465 --> 00:08:27.589
We're here to help Selma.

123
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:32.510
So what do you say. help us out?

124
00:08:32.596 --> 00:08:34.011
-You know. why don't I--
-Hey. we tried.

125
00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:35.764
Hey. give that back.

126
00:08:38.602 --> 00:08:40.143
I got it.

127
00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.145
Hey. this was fun...

128
00:08:42.272 --> 00:08:44.022
am I right. Tamara?

129
00:08:57.704 --> 00:08:58.987
Where's Willow?

130
00:08:59.081 --> 00:09:01.289
With some friends.

131
00:09:01.375 --> 00:09:03.667
Not those friends.
I'm picking her up later.

132
00:09:03.794 --> 00:09:05.794
Okay.

133
00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:10.465
You'll never guess who showed up
at our doorstep today.

134
00:09:10.551 --> 00:09:11.967
Selma.

135
00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:14.636
Your little sister. Selma?

136
00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:17.764
Do you mind putting that down
for just one second?

137
00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:21.977
Sorry.

138
00:09:25.983 --> 00:09:28.483
Why didn't she stay for dinner?

139
00:09:28.569 --> 00:09:31.352
I have told you the history
that Selma and I have.

140
00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:34.447
She was kind of flighty.
or something like that?

141
00:09:37.578 --> 00:09:38.994
We haven't talked in
seven or eight years.

142
00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:41.496
-After your mom?
-Shortly after.

143
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:46.876
When... mom got sick...

144
00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:49.588
liver gave out...

145
00:09:50.507 --> 00:09:53.008
Selma went wild.

146
00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:56.970
Partying all night. would
disappear for days on end.

147
00:09:58.473 --> 00:10:01.600
I was left to take care
of our dying mom...

148
00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:04.811
on my own.

149
00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:07.772
You both were quite young.

150
00:10:07.858 --> 00:10:10.358
Selma was just a few years
older than Willow is now.

151
00:10:26.043 --> 00:10:28.668
Willow is safe and sound in bed.

152
00:10:30.464 --> 00:10:32.505
Think it was a good thing
to let her stay out a bit.

153
00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:36.843
Did I do the right thing today?

154
00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:38.762
With what. Willow?

155
00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:40.847
My sister.

156
00:10:46.772 --> 00:10:48.763
Well. if I'm being honest...

157
00:10:48.857 --> 00:10:50.765
if she showed up to face you.

158
00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:52.651
she probably really
needs the help.

159
00:11:28.939 --> 00:11:30.814
Been looking all over for you.

160
00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:37.529
Madison. what are
you doing here?

161
00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:40.532
So...

162
00:11:42.119 --> 00:11:44.285
What'd you do this time?

163
00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:46.830
Heh. After all these years. I
guess you haven't changed much.

164
00:11:46.957 --> 00:11:48.581
Yeah. you haven't either.

165
00:11:49.876 --> 00:11:51.167
Little Selma.

166
00:11:52.337 --> 00:11:54.838
Free spirit everyone loved.

167
00:11:54.965 --> 00:11:57.549
Wild child that
could do no wrong.

168
00:11:59.928 --> 00:12:01.636
Got you pretty far in life. huh?

169
00:12:01.722 --> 00:12:05.223
Look... I decided to get out
of a bad situation. okay?

170
00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:07.892
I needed a place the
crash for a couple nights.

171
00:12:07.978 --> 00:12:10.011
If I had another option.
I'd take it. but I'm good.

172
00:12:10.105 --> 00:12:11.646
Is that so?

173
00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:15.400
How'd that happen?

174
00:12:19.823 --> 00:12:21.698
Look. I really appreciate
you finding me.

175
00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:23.533
I'm sure you mean well.

176
00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.286
But... I'll be all right. Maddy.

177
00:12:27.914 --> 00:12:31.416
"Maddy." No one's called me
that in years.

178
00:12:33.211 --> 00:12:34.669
I gotta get going.

179
00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.716
For what it was worth.
it was good seeing you.

180
00:12:44.181 --> 00:12:45.597
Selma. wait.

181
00:12:47.184 --> 00:12:48.850
Just wait.

182
00:13:03.617 --> 00:13:06.284
That was taken by the
area's premier photographer.

183
00:13:06.369 --> 00:13:07.577
Wolf Landen.

184
00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:13.908
I don't know why
I just said that.

185
00:13:14.002 --> 00:13:17.337
Willow's gotten so big.
I can barely recognize her.

186
00:13:18.673 --> 00:13:20.173
Selma...

187
00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:26.587
I need to know you won't bring
anything bad into my home.

188
00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:28.556
Oh.

189
00:13:28.642 --> 00:13:31.226
I got as far away from
all that as I possibly could.

190
00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:33.094
I just need a place to.
you know.

191
00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:35.763
sort myself out for a couple
days before I go out West.

192
00:13:35.857 --> 00:13:37.941
California. you mentioned?

193
00:13:38.068 --> 00:13:40.109
Yeah. maybe. you know.

194
00:13:40.237 --> 00:13:41.936
feels like a fresh start.

195
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.613
Anywhere but here.

196
00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.785
Wow.

197
00:13:48.912 --> 00:13:51.454
Looks like you've done
well for yourself.

198
00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:53.122
Always knew that you would.

199
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:55.950
-It's all Nolan really.
-No...

200
00:13:56.044 --> 00:13:58.119
I can tell this-this is all you.

201
00:13:58.213 --> 00:13:59.954
I'm happy for you. Madison.

202
00:14:00.048 --> 00:14:02.465
Well. I made up the guest
bedroom. has its own bathroom

203
00:14:02.592 --> 00:14:05.051
so make yourself at home.

204
00:14:13.228 --> 00:14:15.979
This means so much to me.
Thank you.

205
00:14:43.967 --> 00:14:46.500
You think that you
can just go out...

206
00:14:46.595 --> 00:14:47.969
hmm. without my permission?

207
00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:49.503
You dragged me out
of that bar in front of

208
00:14:49.598 --> 00:14:51.339
everyone. you psycho.

209
00:14:51.433 --> 00:14:54.017
And who do you think is gonna
do a damn thing about it?

210
00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:46.894
I love it.

211
00:15:46.988 --> 00:15:48.905
Well. you can totally have it.

212
00:15:50.992 --> 00:15:53.493
- What's going on here?
- -Just some girl talk.

213
00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:56.287
We've been chatting all morning
getting to know each other.

214
00:15:56.373 --> 00:15:58.539
Let's please. please
talk some more later. okay?

215
00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:00.241
Yeah. of course.

216
00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:03.044
You're so cool.
I wish you were here more.

217
00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:05.380
I could really use
the chill vibes.

218
00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:09.717
Good morning to you.
too. Willow.

219
00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:16.516
As much as I try to deny it.

220
00:16:16.601 --> 00:16:17.809
there's a lot of you
and that young lady

221
00:16:17.894 --> 00:16:19.227
and it scares the hell outta me.

222
00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:20.761
I wouldn't worry too much.

223
00:16:20.855 --> 00:16:22.930
She's a good girl.

224
00:16:23.024 --> 00:16:25.274
You did real good.

225
00:16:25.402 --> 00:16:26.934
So I am heading out
to run some errands.

226
00:16:27.028 --> 00:16:28.102
I thought you might
wanna come along.

227
00:16:28.196 --> 00:16:29.195
pick up some stuff
for your trip.

228
00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.938
Uh. you know what?

229
00:16:31.032 --> 00:16:34.033
I think I'd like to stay
if that's okay.

230
00:16:34.119 --> 00:16:36.619
I haven't really had
a chance to sit and be.

231
00:16:36.746 --> 00:16:39.330
Totally understand.

232
00:16:39.415 --> 00:16:41.582
I don't think anyone will
be home for a couple hours.

233
00:16:41.668 --> 00:16:44.127
so take a bath.
enjoy yourself.

234
00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:47.296
This is. this is good.
isn't it?

235
00:16:47.424 --> 00:16:49.465
Yeah. yeah. it is.

236
00:17:10.613 --> 00:17:12.446
Just doing some laundry.

237
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.450
Hello?

238
00:17:28.173 --> 00:17:29.380
Hello?

239
00:17:31.634 --> 00:17:33.301
Hey. Maddy. is that you?

240
00:17:37.974 --> 00:17:39.682
I borrowed a shirt.

241
00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:09.712
Ow!

242
00:18:10.924 --> 00:18:12.131
Oh!

243
00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:16.719
Ow.

244
00:18:21.726 --> 00:18:23.601
Great.

245
00:18:23.686 --> 00:18:26.938
Here for a day.
already making a mess.

246
00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:14.569
Come on out. Selma.

247
00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.822
Where are you?

248
00:19:19.576 --> 00:19:21.159
We're here to take you home.

249
00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.120
Come on.

250
00:19:24.247 --> 00:19:25.746
You know you belong to us now.

251
00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:47.435
Hello?

252
00:20:05.914 --> 00:20:07.246
Did you miss us. sweetheart?

253
00:20:07.332 --> 00:20:09.457
Stay away from me.
you sadistic bastard.

254
00:20:22.764 --> 00:20:24.680
Hey. where do you think
you're going. huh?

255
00:20:24.807 --> 00:20:27.183
You got some debts to pay and
the payment is substantial.

256
00:20:33.942 --> 00:20:35.849
This is fun.

257
00:20:35.944 --> 00:20:37.685
There's nowhere to run.
little rabbit!

258
00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:39.019
Let's just go home.

259
00:21:22.573 --> 00:21:23.656
Maddy. Maddy!

260
00:21:26.452 --> 00:21:27.743
Maddy!

261
00:21:29.414 --> 00:21:30.404
Dammit!

262
00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:32.957
Okay.

263
00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.723
Selma?

264
00:21:48.808 --> 00:21:50.424
Making tea? Water's ready.

265
00:22:09.746 --> 00:22:13.039
Selma. what-what is going on?

266
00:22:52.455 --> 00:22:53.579
Shh.

267
00:22:55.375 --> 00:22:56.999
Come on. let's go.

268
00:23:09.972 --> 00:23:13.432
Didn't expect her to be
so feisty. I'm impressed.

269
00:23:13.518 --> 00:23:15.935
Yeah. I'm tired of all
this running around.

270
00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:17.603
Let's flush her out.
make the call.

271
00:23:23.277 --> 00:23:25.853
What the hell
is going on. Selma?

272
00:23:25.947 --> 00:23:27.521
Who are those men in my house?

273
00:23:27.615 --> 00:23:28.948
Just gotta keep driving
a ways. okay?

274
00:23:29.033 --> 00:23:30.524
-Trust me.
-Absolutely not.

275
00:23:30.618 --> 00:23:32.693
We are going straight
to the police station now.

276
00:23:32.787 --> 00:23:34.286
They are the police. Maddy.

277
00:23:35.456 --> 00:23:36.997
What kind of trouble are you in?

278
00:23:37.083 --> 00:23:38.624
The worst kind.

279
00:24:02.942 --> 00:24:04.400
Hello?

280
00:24:04.527 --> 00:24:06.902
Thank God you got Willow
to your parents' house.

281
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:08.362
Where are you?

282
00:24:08.448 --> 00:24:09.989
Can you please stay there
for a couple days

283
00:24:10.074 --> 00:24:12.566
till the police get this
all straightened out?

284
00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:15.953
No. I left my phone.

285
00:24:16.038 --> 00:24:17.955
When are you
coming home?

286
00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.748
I'm going straight
to the police now.

287
00:24:19.876 --> 00:24:21.408
And Selma?

288
00:24:21.502 --> 00:24:22.960
I don't care. I-I don't.

289
00:24:23.045 --> 00:24:25.045
She knowingly put
my family in jeopardy.

290
00:24:25.131 --> 00:24:27.006
She's also your family.

291
00:24:28.759 --> 00:24:29.925
Nolan?

292
00:24:32.346 --> 00:24:34.054
You there?

293
00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:35.723
You'd better find a TV.

294
00:24:40.938 --> 00:24:43.230
Uh. I'll call you back.

295
00:24:49.197 --> 00:24:50.571
Where'd you get these clothes?

296
00:24:50.656 --> 00:24:54.116
Selma. what have
you done to me?

297
00:24:59.373 --> 00:25:02.166
You're right. Maddy.
you should turn yourself in.

298
00:25:03.794 --> 00:25:05.452
They don't want you. okay?

299
00:25:05.546 --> 00:25:08.464
They just want me. It'll be
safer that way. I'll leave.

300
00:25:08.591 --> 00:25:11.759
Selma. my face is plastered
all over the news.

301
00:25:11.844 --> 00:25:13.344
Why don't you go tell them
everything. okay?

302
00:25:14.931 --> 00:25:17.056
You know what?
Tell them I kidnapped you.

303
00:25:17.141 --> 00:25:18.140
You can do that.

304
00:25:18.267 --> 00:25:20.893
I asked you if you were
gonna bring anything bad

305
00:25:20.978 --> 00:25:23.938
into my home and you
looked me in the eyes.

306
00:25:24.023 --> 00:25:26.065
I am so stupid.

307
00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:30.486
You-you lie and lie.

308
00:25:32.615 --> 00:25:33.989
I shot him.

309
00:25:37.578 --> 00:25:40.162
-Selma?
-I shot him down.

310
00:25:42.083 --> 00:25:43.082
Selma?

311
00:25:44.418 --> 00:25:45.826
Selma. what are you saying?

312
00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.829
God. I had no other
choice. Maddy.

313
00:25:48.923 --> 00:25:51.173
It was only a matter of time
before he killed me. you know?

314
00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:53.384
I-I had no other way out.

315
00:25:55.221 --> 00:25:57.671
Oh. God. I was gonna tell you
when I first got to your house.

316
00:25:57.765 --> 00:26:01.934
but... you were so upset and...

317
00:26:02.019 --> 00:26:03.894
I just couldn't. okay?
I'm sorry.

318
00:26:04.814 --> 00:26:06.438
I'm so sorry.

319
00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:09.191
I didn't know.

320
00:26:11.779 --> 00:26:14.021
Uh...

321
00:26:14.115 --> 00:26:17.691
Let's-let's go
to the police together.

322
00:26:17.785 --> 00:26:19.359
I will help you explain.

323
00:26:19.453 --> 00:26:21.620
-You don't understand.
-I will help.

324
00:26:21.706 --> 00:26:25.124
They are bad cops
in a vile drug ring. okay?

325
00:26:25.209 --> 00:26:27.543
And my husband turned out
to be the leader.

326
00:26:29.839 --> 00:26:31.672
I know how dangerous they are.

327
00:26:34.051 --> 00:26:35.593
I'm the villain now.

328
00:26:36.846 --> 00:26:38.554
And I've seen too much.

329
00:26:40.266 --> 00:26:41.882
Nowhere is safe.

330
00:26:41.976 --> 00:26:43.726
Okay. Uh...

331
00:26:45.479 --> 00:26:47.554
I know you've gotten yourself
into some trouble before.

332
00:26:47.648 --> 00:26:50.232
but you're no murderer.
I know that.

333
00:26:52.862 --> 00:26:54.737
I know somewhere
I can take you.

334
00:26:54.864 --> 00:26:56.822
until we get this sorted out.

335
00:26:56.907 --> 00:27:00.901
I'll drop you off.
you'll be safe there.

336
00:27:00.995 --> 00:27:03.078
Please. please
let me do that.

337
00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:11.337
Okay. okay.

338
00:27:29.523 --> 00:27:30.648
You okay?

339
00:27:32.318 --> 00:27:34.902
Yeah. just a stupid dream.

340
00:27:37.198 --> 00:27:39.073
How long was I out?

341
00:27:39.158 --> 00:27:40.783
The whole drive.

342
00:27:54.632 --> 00:27:56.456
What is this place?

343
00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:59.259
Nolan's brother Billy's
kind of an off-the-grid-hunter

344
00:27:59.345 --> 00:28:03.463
type of guy. he lets us
stay here whenever we want.

345
00:28:03.557 --> 00:28:05.966
It's safe. there's...

346
00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:07.968
canned goods in the kitchen.

347
00:28:08.062 --> 00:28:09.812
extra clothes in the closet.

348
00:28:10.898 --> 00:28:12.606
Cell phones don't work here.

349
00:28:12.692 --> 00:28:15.776
but there's a landline.

350
00:28:15.861 --> 00:28:18.779
I can't thank you enough.

351
00:28:18.864 --> 00:28:22.315
Well. I...
I should get going.

352
00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:24.618
Why don't you just
sleep for a bit?

353
00:28:24.704 --> 00:28:27.663
Just even for an hour.
you drove all night.

354
00:28:29.125 --> 00:28:31.125
Uh...

355
00:28:32.294 --> 00:28:34.044
Yeah. yeah.

356
00:28:35.589 --> 00:28:36.922
Yeah. you're right.

357
00:28:54.108 --> 00:28:57.151
I don't understand.
How is she wanted?

358
00:28:57.236 --> 00:28:59.519
It's only for questioning.
Mr. Thompson.

359
00:28:59.613 --> 00:29:02.856
Someone breaks into her home.
trashes the place.

360
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:06.034
Now my wife is wanted
for questioning?

361
00:29:06.162 --> 00:29:09.196
She's a cheer mom.
this is ridiculous.

362
00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:12.032
If you hear from your wife.
please call us.

363
00:29:12.126 --> 00:29:15.627
In the meantime. we can add
extra patrol down your street.

364
00:29:15.713 --> 00:29:17.537
Yeah. thanks.

365
00:29:17.631 --> 00:29:19.590
Makes me feel real safe.

366
00:29:21.802 --> 00:29:24.261
Dad. when is mom coming home?

367
00:29:27.975 --> 00:29:30.517
She and your Aunt Selma
are figuring a few things out.

368
00:29:32.396 --> 00:29:34.146
It's complicated. Willow.

369
00:29:34.231 --> 00:29:35.981
Everyone keeps
making fun of them.

370
00:29:36.066 --> 00:29:39.401
calling them Thelma and Louise.
whatever that means.

371
00:29:39.528 --> 00:29:41.320
You know your mom...

372
00:29:41.405 --> 00:29:43.739
she'd never do anything
to hurt this family.

373
00:29:45.868 --> 00:29:47.067
Go get the rest of your stuff

374
00:29:47.161 --> 00:29:49.703
so we can head back
to grandma's.

375
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:50.829
Okay.

376
00:30:37.878 --> 00:30:39.786
The two
sisters have fled the area

377
00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.454
according to authorities.

378
00:30:41.549 --> 00:30:44.132
Selma Carrera is now
wanted in association

379
00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:45.801
with the shooting
of Jason Sinclair.

380
00:30:45.928 --> 00:30:47.594
a respected police offi--

381
00:31:05.948 --> 00:31:07.865
Beautiful. isn't it?

382
00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:09.116
Breathtaking.

383
00:31:10.494 --> 00:31:13.620
Wanted to say.
I'm sorry. Selma.

384
00:31:15.207 --> 00:31:16.823
You're apologizing to me?

385
00:31:16.917 --> 00:31:19.084
After what I just put you
and your family through.

386
00:31:19.169 --> 00:31:23.380
I've come to realize
over the past few days

387
00:31:23.465 --> 00:31:25.665
why I've been so...

388
00:31:25.759 --> 00:31:28.510
hard on my daughter.

389
00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:32.839
I let you down.

390
00:31:32.933 --> 00:31:35.183
I abandoned you
when you needed me the most.

391
00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:40.939
And. now. Willow is
paying for my mistakes.

392
00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:43.817
Yeah. well. as I recall.

393
00:31:43.903 --> 00:31:46.236
I didn't give you
much of a choice.

394
00:31:46.322 --> 00:31:48.355
You were just a kid.

395
00:31:48.449 --> 00:31:50.690
So were you. Maddy.

396
00:31:50.784 --> 00:31:53.360
Really. it's all mom's fault.

397
00:31:53.454 --> 00:31:54.411
Old cow.

398
00:31:57.374 --> 00:31:58.865
Yeah.

399
00:31:58.959 --> 00:32:01.418
It wasn't easy growing up
in that house. was it?

400
00:32:01.503 --> 00:32:03.128
I mean it.

401
00:32:03.213 --> 00:32:04.713
Selma. I'm sorry.

402
00:32:08.636 --> 00:32:10.177
You're a good person.

403
00:32:10.262 --> 00:32:12.379
Just some.
just some bad choices

404
00:32:12.473 --> 00:32:14.348
and some rotten luck.

405
00:32:15.851 --> 00:32:20.220
Which is why
what I'm... about to do

406
00:32:20.314 --> 00:32:22.147
hurts me more than anything.

407
00:32:24.652 --> 00:32:26.443
What are you talking about?

408
00:32:28.614 --> 00:32:29.905
Rusty?

409
00:32:41.377 --> 00:32:44.744
-Hey. Madison.
-Hey. Rusty.

410
00:32:44.838 --> 00:32:47.747
-I trusted you.
-It's for your own good.

411
00:32:47.841 --> 00:32:50.717
What are you gonna do. keep
running the rest of your life?

412
00:32:50.803 --> 00:32:52.886
I failed you once.
I'm not doing it again.

413
00:32:52.972 --> 00:32:54.587
You don't get it.

414
00:32:54.682 --> 00:32:56.589
They will get to me anywhere.

415
00:32:56.684 --> 00:32:58.100
It doesn't matter if
I'm in some police holding cell

416
00:32:58.227 --> 00:32:59.426
they will get to me.

417
00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:01.428
Hey. can we please
just calm down?

418
00:33:01.522 --> 00:33:04.097
I've known Rusty
for a long time.

419
00:33:04.191 --> 00:33:05.941
I trust him. he can help us.

420
00:33:06.068 --> 00:33:07.609
You just killed me.

421
00:33:07.736 --> 00:33:09.861
Can we at least talk about this?

422
00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.614
Hey. Selma...

423
00:33:14.201 --> 00:33:16.284
I'm not arresting anyone today.

424
00:33:17.871 --> 00:33:19.287
At least not here.

425
00:33:19.415 --> 00:33:22.290
So. could we please...

426
00:33:22.418 --> 00:33:23.959
go inside and talk?

427
00:33:39.226 --> 00:33:41.134
Well. that is quite a story.

428
00:33:41.228 --> 00:33:42.728
You don't have to believe me.

429
00:33:43.605 --> 00:33:44.646
I don't expect you to.

430
00:33:44.773 --> 00:33:45.856
No. I didn't say that.

431
00:33:48.193 --> 00:33:51.820
I didn't...
That-that's just a whole lot...

432
00:33:51.947 --> 00:33:53.989
to unravel. a whole lot.

433
00:33:57.786 --> 00:33:59.244
I know your sister.

434
00:34:00.414 --> 00:34:03.323
I trust her and her family.

435
00:34:03.417 --> 00:34:05.083
but I don't know you.

436
00:34:05.169 --> 00:34:07.252
-She's not a killer. Rusty.
-Do you have any proof?

437
00:34:08.922 --> 00:34:12.215
Crimes. abuse. self-defense?

438
00:34:12.301 --> 00:34:14.217
No.

439
00:34:16.304 --> 00:34:19.264
I never filed anything.
'cause what's the point?

440
00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:23.310
He had everyone convinced
I was some sort of junkie.

441
00:34:23.395 --> 00:34:26.679
-Look. all I have is my word.
-Obviously. she's not.

442
00:34:26.774 --> 00:34:29.315
I mean. she was
protecting herself.

443
00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.775
Who would make that up?

444
00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:33.277
Well. that's not quite
how this works. Madison.

445
00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:35.614
So what do we do?

446
00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:38.992
Will you stay here?

447
00:34:40.704 --> 00:34:42.036
You won't run?

448
00:34:43.331 --> 00:34:45.123
Yeah. I can do that.

449
00:34:45.208 --> 00:34:46.625
I'm being serious. Selma.

450
00:34:48.504 --> 00:34:50.703
I'm not talking
about losing my job.

451
00:34:50.797 --> 00:34:53.422
This is aiding and abetting.

452
00:34:53.509 --> 00:34:55.509
This is prison for me.

453
00:34:57.638 --> 00:34:59.596
So I need you to sit tight.

454
00:35:08.816 --> 00:35:10.440
Hey. Madison...

455
00:35:12.361 --> 00:35:14.361
and I got your word too?

456
00:35:14.446 --> 00:35:15.654
What?

457
00:35:15.739 --> 00:35:17.730
I-I need to
get home to my family.

458
00:35:17.825 --> 00:35:19.449
Willow has practice.

459
00:35:22.121 --> 00:35:24.070
I'm not involved
in any of this.

460
00:35:24.164 --> 00:35:27.958
That A.P.B.. that's out on you.
says otherwise.

461
00:35:28.043 --> 00:35:29.543
So I need you to stay with her.

462
00:35:29.628 --> 00:35:32.420
I'm in the P.T.A.
for God's sake.

463
00:35:32.548 --> 00:35:35.248
Listen. I understand. just
let me check a few things out.

464
00:35:35.342 --> 00:35:36.583
see what I can quietly dig up.

465
00:35:36.677 --> 00:35:38.426
but it might take a day or two.

466
00:35:38.554 --> 00:35:40.428
That might be all I have.

467
00:35:42.641 --> 00:35:44.099
Hey...

468
00:35:45.561 --> 00:35:47.477
why are you doing this for us?

469
00:35:50.023 --> 00:35:53.191
My dad. he's a cop.
my granddad. too.

470
00:35:54.361 --> 00:35:57.320
Most all of us are good people.

471
00:35:57.406 --> 00:36:00.440
And I'm just real tired of
the small few destroying that.

472
00:36:34.067 --> 00:36:35.308
-What'd you think you're doing?
-I'm getting outta here.

473
00:36:35.402 --> 00:36:36.809
-It's not safe.
-Rusty--

474
00:36:36.904 --> 00:36:38.311
Once they catch wind of this...

475
00:36:38.405 --> 00:36:39.979
-They're gonna kill us.
-Rusty will help us.

476
00:36:40.073 --> 00:36:41.489
They'll eat him alive.

477
00:36:41.617 --> 00:36:43.325
-Move. Maddy.
-I gave Rusty my word.

478
00:36:43.452 --> 00:36:45.243
I shot a cop. okay?

479
00:36:45.329 --> 00:36:47.412
When are you gonna get that
through your thick skull?

480
00:36:47.497 --> 00:36:48.997
I am not letting you leave.

481
00:36:49.124 --> 00:36:51.499
Get outta my way.
We're not kids anymore.

482
00:36:51.627 --> 00:36:52.751
I said no.

483
00:36:54.588 --> 00:36:57.422
I'm warning you
for the last time.

484
00:37:04.431 --> 00:37:05.838
I said. I'm leaving.

485
00:37:13.774 --> 00:37:15.732
Looks like your big sister
can still take you.

486
00:37:17.319 --> 00:37:18.985
No. Jason! Jason. no!

487
00:37:19.071 --> 00:37:20.570
Jason. no! Jason!

488
00:37:20.656 --> 00:37:22.188
No. Jason!

489
00:37:24.868 --> 00:37:27.118
S-Selma. Selma!

490
00:37:27.204 --> 00:37:29.496
I would never hurt you.

491
00:37:30.958 --> 00:37:33.917
Selma. it's me. it's me.

492
00:37:34.711 --> 00:37:36.035
Okay?

493
00:37:36.129 --> 00:37:38.255
I'm only trying
to protect you is all.

494
00:37:49.142 --> 00:37:50.717
Sometimes they'd
leave me handcuffed

495
00:37:50.811 --> 00:37:51.935
to the bed for days.

496
00:37:53.897 --> 00:37:56.606
It just pains my heart.

497
00:37:56.692 --> 00:37:58.775
I just. I had no idea. Selma.

498
00:38:00.696 --> 00:38:03.238
I had no control
over my own life.

499
00:38:03.365 --> 00:38:05.323
I had no friends. no car.

500
00:38:06.994 --> 00:38:08.451
I completely belonged to him.

501
00:38:12.374 --> 00:38:14.332
You know...

502
00:38:20.549 --> 00:38:23.800
When you left.
and I was all alone with mom...

503
00:38:26.138 --> 00:38:27.345
things were bad.

504
00:38:29.516 --> 00:38:31.516
She was real bad.

505
00:38:31.601 --> 00:38:33.393
Emotionally. the drinking.

506
00:38:36.523 --> 00:38:38.765
It was almost as if she kinda

507
00:38:38.859 --> 00:38:41.318
just held it all together
until you moved out...

508
00:38:42.738 --> 00:38:44.654
and then let it
completely unravel.

509
00:38:47.284 --> 00:38:48.450
That's why I left.

510
00:38:50.329 --> 00:38:53.246
I was so afraid I was gonna
turn out just like her.

511
00:38:55.208 --> 00:38:56.791
Eventually. I did.

512
00:39:00.213 --> 00:39:01.338
But I'm so tired of running.

513
00:39:03.967 --> 00:39:06.292
I've been running from
everything since I was a kid.

514
00:39:06.386 --> 00:39:07.969
We'll fix this.

515
00:39:08.096 --> 00:39:10.797
We'll go to a lawyer. the press.

516
00:39:10.891 --> 00:39:12.632
right when Rusty says
it's okay to.

517
00:39:16.772 --> 00:39:19.647
I don't even care what happens.

518
00:39:21.735 --> 00:39:24.477
I just won't let them
hurt me anymore.

519
00:39:34.081 --> 00:39:35.663
You better have
something this time.

520
00:39:35.791 --> 00:39:37.582
I don't wanna hear
about nothing.

521
00:39:37.667 --> 00:39:39.918
All right. yeah. that sounds
good to me. I got it.

522
00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:47.133
Did you get anything?

523
00:39:47.219 --> 00:39:49.001
You know I got something.
right around here.

524
00:39:49.096 --> 00:39:51.003
Nice. Okay. this time
we come prepared.

525
00:39:51.098 --> 00:39:52.389
Tired of this
cat and mouse game.

526
00:39:52.474 --> 00:39:53.723
We get outta here.
we're gonna get.

527
00:40:31.346 --> 00:40:33.179
I'm not going back.

528
00:41:22.731 --> 00:41:24.731
God!

529
00:41:24.816 --> 00:41:27.984
I figured you all could
use some groceries.

530
00:41:29.154 --> 00:41:31.154
Thought you might need it.

531
00:41:31.239 --> 00:41:33.990
Can't creep up on people
like that. Rusty.

532
00:41:35.202 --> 00:41:36.784
Come on in.

533
00:41:39.206 --> 00:41:40.580
Some help?

534
00:41:49.591 --> 00:41:51.716
So. where's Madison?

535
00:41:51.801 --> 00:41:53.635
Uh. still sleeping. I guess.

536
00:41:59.768 --> 00:42:01.768
You. uh...

537
00:42:01.853 --> 00:42:03.728
So. did you find anything?

538
00:42:03.813 --> 00:42:05.805
Anything at all?

539
00:42:05.899 --> 00:42:07.732
Well. the bad news...

540
00:42:09.569 --> 00:42:11.644
Right now. you're a cop killer.

541
00:42:11.738 --> 00:42:13.905
And that means there are a
lot of folks gunning for you.

542
00:42:15.951 --> 00:42:17.483
But the good news is that
there's someone down in

543
00:42:17.577 --> 00:42:20.828
Fullerton County who's
got suspicions of their own...

544
00:42:20.956 --> 00:42:22.539
and we've been swapping calls.

545
00:42:22.624 --> 00:42:24.499
Well. do you trust them?

546
00:42:24.626 --> 00:42:26.158
They're a friend of a friend.

547
00:42:26.253 --> 00:42:28.419
So. so far no reason not to.

548
00:42:28.505 --> 00:42:30.004
That's something. I guess.

549
00:42:31.424 --> 00:42:34.676
Look. this internal
business is messy.

550
00:42:34.803 --> 00:42:36.177
It takes time.

551
00:42:36.304 --> 00:42:38.337
I don't want you to
get your hopes up.

552
00:42:38.431 --> 00:42:40.339
No. uh...

553
00:42:40.433 --> 00:42:43.685
I don't... get my hopes up.

554
00:42:43.812 --> 00:42:45.353
not anymore.

555
00:42:48.233 --> 00:42:51.183
So. um...

556
00:42:51.278 --> 00:42:52.685
How do you know Madison?

557
00:42:52.779 --> 00:42:54.186
Oh. college.

558
00:42:54.281 --> 00:42:56.355
We lost touch.
you know. as people do.

559
00:42:56.449 --> 00:42:59.117
And then by chance.
ran into her and the family

560
00:42:59.202 --> 00:43:01.411
a few summers ago. now.

561
00:43:01.496 --> 00:43:03.246
Friends in college. huh?

562
00:43:07.043 --> 00:43:11.871
Well... I'd be lying if there
wasn't a little bit of a crush

563
00:43:11.965 --> 00:43:13.706
in the beginning.

564
00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:16.217
Believe it or not.
I wasn't all this back then.

565
00:43:16.344 --> 00:43:21.047
I was a pimply-faced pup. away
from home for the first time.

566
00:43:21.141 --> 00:43:24.350
And Madison. she helped me
through some really tough times.

567
00:43:24.436 --> 00:43:25.935
She became my best friend.

568
00:43:26.021 --> 00:43:27.553
So I should trust you?

569
00:43:27.647 --> 00:43:30.556
Well. when she called.
I wanted to help.

570
00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:33.192
Look...

571
00:43:33.278 --> 00:43:37.155
I've seen what happens to cops
that rat out other cops.

572
00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:38.740
They get it much worse.

573
00:43:39.701 --> 00:43:41.117
Is that what you want?

574
00:43:41.202 --> 00:43:42.827
You got a death wish?

575
00:43:44.164 --> 00:43:46.998
I want to do the right thing.

576
00:43:47.083 --> 00:43:48.708
Yeah. well.
I trusted a cop once.

577
00:43:48.793 --> 00:43:50.501
Didn't turn out too well.

578
00:43:50.587 --> 00:43:54.547
Well. look at that.
haven't see one of those on you.

579
00:43:54.633 --> 00:43:55.840
What?

580
00:43:55.925 --> 00:43:57.249
A smile.

581
00:44:01.264 --> 00:44:03.222
Looks like you're having
some trouble over there.

582
00:44:11.024 --> 00:44:14.266
I should probably
go check on Madison.

583
00:44:14.361 --> 00:44:17.403
Yeah. I gotta get going too.

584
00:44:17.489 --> 00:44:20.156
I'll see if I can comeback
around later.

585
00:44:20.241 --> 00:44:22.608
Yeah. and. hey. Selma...

586
00:44:22.702 --> 00:44:24.118
Good swing.

587
00:44:31.961 --> 00:44:33.336
I gotta go. okay?

588
00:44:34.506 --> 00:44:35.880
Bye.

589
00:44:39.386 --> 00:44:41.293
How's Nolan?

590
00:44:41.388 --> 00:44:43.388
I had to find out
if they were safe.

591
00:44:43.473 --> 00:44:45.431
Why don't you just go home.
Maddy. okay?

592
00:44:45.517 --> 00:44:47.141
Just go to your family.

593
00:44:47.268 --> 00:44:50.469
I was up all night freaking out.

594
00:44:50.563 --> 00:44:51.979
almost left about three times.

595
00:44:52.107 --> 00:44:54.306
even sat in the car for a while.

596
00:44:54.401 --> 00:44:57.309
Look. they just want me. so
if you get out now. I promise.

597
00:44:57.404 --> 00:44:58.778
you'll never see them again.

598
00:44:58.863 --> 00:45:02.148
No. no.
I have made up my mind.

599
00:45:02.242 --> 00:45:05.985
We are riding this out together.
me and you. until the end.

600
00:45:06.079 --> 00:45:08.654
This isn't a game. Madison.

601
00:45:08.748 --> 00:45:10.540
There's no riding this out.

602
00:45:15.922 --> 00:45:17.755
Truth is...

603
00:45:19.426 --> 00:45:22.260
Truth is. I don't-I don't
wanna go home.

604
00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:26.347
Come again?

605
00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:28.975
Yeah.

606
00:45:30.145 --> 00:45:31.602
Yeah. that's the truth.

607
00:45:32.772 --> 00:45:34.680
I don't understand.

608
00:45:34.774 --> 00:45:37.775
I work so hard to make
everything look perfect

609
00:45:37.861 --> 00:45:40.278
on the outside.

610
00:45:40.363 --> 00:45:41.988
But the inside.

611
00:45:42.073 --> 00:45:44.532
I've seen the inside.
it still looks pretty perfect.

612
00:45:44.659 --> 00:45:46.284
It's not.

613
00:45:46.369 --> 00:45:51.164
I... I feel bad even saying it
because I'm fortunate.

614
00:45:51.249 --> 00:45:54.751
I know that. but just because
you have a nice house.

615
00:45:54.836 --> 00:45:58.129
nice things. it doesn't-it
doesn't-it doesn't fix things.

616
00:45:59.299 --> 00:46:00.873
I know.

617
00:46:00.967 --> 00:46:04.177
No. Nolan's been checked
out for years.

618
00:46:04.262 --> 00:46:05.928
My daughter. she hates me.

619
00:46:06.014 --> 00:46:07.597
You should see how much fun
they have together

620
00:46:07.682 --> 00:46:08.848
when I'm not around.

621
00:46:08.933 --> 00:46:10.683
Maddy. you're their rock.

622
00:46:10.769 --> 00:46:13.219
Sometimes a rock's
gotta be hard.

623
00:46:13.313 --> 00:46:14.896
I've been too hard.

624
00:46:16.274 --> 00:46:18.149
Sometimes downright mean.

625
00:46:20.111 --> 00:46:22.278
You know. it just happens.

626
00:46:22.363 --> 00:46:24.405
Can't even look myself in
the mirror some days.

627
00:46:27.952 --> 00:46:29.902
Sitting in that car last night.
I realized

628
00:46:29.996 --> 00:46:32.238
I need to repair a few things
starting with you.

629
00:46:32.332 --> 00:46:35.908
or... I-I won't move on.

630
00:46:36.002 --> 00:46:38.577
Maddy. we're good. okay?

631
00:46:38.671 --> 00:46:40.421
I love you. go home.

632
00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:46.252
Well... I am not leaving.

633
00:46:46.346 --> 00:46:47.553
So there.

634
00:46:49.682 --> 00:46:53.309
Oh. we have a little problem.

635
00:46:56.022 --> 00:46:57.438
It's empty.

636
00:47:23.883 --> 00:47:26.792
-Good morning. Darlene.
-How you doing. Rusty?

637
00:47:26.886 --> 00:47:28.302
The people from Fulton are here.

638
00:47:28.429 --> 00:47:30.388
Who. now?

639
00:47:30.473 --> 00:47:32.598
The people you wanted to talk to
over the two missing sisters.

640
00:47:32.684 --> 00:47:34.767
Well. that was just supposed
to be another phone call.

641
00:47:34.853 --> 00:47:37.019
Yeah. well. they're here.

642
00:47:37.105 --> 00:47:38.729
I put 'em back in your
office for you.

643
00:47:42.735 --> 00:47:44.277
All right.

644
00:47:44.362 --> 00:47:47.238
-Hold my calls?
-Sure.

645
00:47:54.956 --> 00:47:58.082
He's not answering.
I can't be without my inhaler.

646
00:48:00.211 --> 00:48:01.827
We'll think of something.

647
00:48:03.256 --> 00:48:07.666
Gentlemen.
I'm Deputy Rusty Harris.

648
00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:08.968
Well. we appreciate
the call. Deputy.

649
00:48:09.053 --> 00:48:10.970
Call me Rusty.

650
00:48:11.055 --> 00:48:14.682
Rusty. look. there's a lot
of concerning accusations

651
00:48:14.809 --> 00:48:16.225
floating around at the moment.

652
00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:21.647
I'm sorry. I'm. I was speaking

653
00:48:21.733 --> 00:48:23.733
with an
Officer Bianca Proudfoot.

654
00:48:24.903 --> 00:48:26.444
Who are you guys?

655
00:48:26.529 --> 00:48:30.698
We're the guys they call
when these incidences arise.

656
00:48:30.825 --> 00:48:35.870
If I may ask. why is a sheriff's
deputy from a small town...

657
00:48:35.997 --> 00:48:38.030
calling in on matters
of state police?

658
00:48:38.124 --> 00:48:40.416
Well. I heard a rumor.

659
00:48:40.501 --> 00:48:43.419
-It's my duty to follow up--
-You know what's not a rumor?

660
00:48:43.504 --> 00:48:45.588
Officer Jason Sinclair was shot.

661
00:48:45.673 --> 00:48:48.174
But you know what else
wasn't a rumor?

662
00:48:48.259 --> 00:48:50.542
He was shot by his wife.

663
00:48:50.637 --> 00:48:52.303
That's love for you. am I right?

664
00:48:53.765 --> 00:48:55.806
Did you know what got him?

665
00:48:55.892 --> 00:48:58.559
It was the bullet.

666
00:48:58.686 --> 00:49:01.062
So you continue to
follow your rumors

667
00:49:01.189 --> 00:49:03.555
and we'll follow the facts.

668
00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:05.891
I'm gonna shoot straight
with you. Rusty.

669
00:49:05.985 --> 00:49:08.235
I'm gonna share with you
his wife's file.

670
00:49:08.363 --> 00:49:11.781
And let me tell you.
it is a doozy of a rap sheet.

671
00:49:13.326 --> 00:49:15.401
Go ahead.

672
00:49:18.373 --> 00:49:22.074
Manipulation. stealing.
It goes on.

673
00:49:22.168 --> 00:49:24.410
Look. this was one of
our own. brother.

674
00:49:24.504 --> 00:49:28.381
So we're gonna follow every
lead. and that's why we're here.

675
00:49:31.719 --> 00:49:36.806
This? This is your duty.
so don't you forget that.

676
00:49:41.813 --> 00:49:43.354
This was fun.

677
00:51:25.249 --> 00:51:29.201
Okay. I got my inhaler.

678
00:51:29.295 --> 00:51:31.295
and a little something--

679
00:51:36.427 --> 00:51:37.802
Selma!

680
00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:42.640
Selma!

681
00:52:02.745 --> 00:52:04.453
I'm not going. I'm not going.
I'm not going.

682
00:52:04.539 --> 00:52:06.455
I'm not going. I'm not going.

683
00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:29.436
Oh. you've gotta be kidding me.

684
00:52:37.238 --> 00:52:41.273
-Hey.
-Wh-what do you want?

685
00:52:41.367 --> 00:52:43.617
Stop. right there.

686
00:52:45.371 --> 00:52:47.037
I wanted to tell you
you're pretty.

687
00:52:48.541 --> 00:52:50.282
Can you help an old fella
buy a drink?

688
00:52:53.546 --> 00:52:56.505
- Yeah. yeah. I can do that.
- -Bless you.

689
00:52:59.218 --> 00:53:00.676
Hey. what are you
doing out here. Bob?

690
00:53:02.221 --> 00:53:05.472
Come on. come on. get going.

691
00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:07.057
Thank you. miss.
you're too kind.

692
00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:13.105
Buy some food with that. Bob.

693
00:53:18.279 --> 00:53:20.479
And what are you doing out here?

694
00:53:20.573 --> 00:53:22.698
-And where's Madison?
-I don't know. she left.

695
00:53:22.783 --> 00:53:24.283
We came down here
to pick up a few things.

696
00:53:24.368 --> 00:53:27.203
Oh. is that so?

697
00:53:27.288 --> 00:53:29.288
This was all a
misunderstanding. okay?

698
00:53:29.373 --> 00:53:31.490
Everything with you seems to be
some kind of misunderstanding.

699
00:53:31.584 --> 00:53:33.250
Madison needed her inhaler.

700
00:53:36.214 --> 00:53:39.590
Come on. just get to the car
before somebody sees us.

701
00:53:39.675 --> 00:53:41.133
Don't do that.

702
00:53:46.098 --> 00:53:49.058
Yeah. I got her.
I'll bring her home.

703
00:53:50.269 --> 00:53:52.436
She's fine. Madison. she's fine.

704
00:53:54.232 --> 00:53:55.481
Okay.

705
00:53:58.402 --> 00:53:59.735
I told you to stay put.

706
00:54:01.948 --> 00:54:04.856
If you got something to say.
why don't you say it. Rusty?

707
00:54:04.951 --> 00:54:06.283
Have you told me everything?

708
00:54:06.369 --> 00:54:07.618
What?

709
00:54:09.288 --> 00:54:11.664
I saw your file. all right?

710
00:54:14.252 --> 00:54:17.836
So you probably think
I'm some kind of monster now.

711
00:54:17.922 --> 00:54:20.130
Well. I'll tell you this much.
it doesn't look good.

712
00:54:22.134 --> 00:54:25.803
I've done some things
I'm not proud of. okay?

713
00:54:25.888 --> 00:54:30.766
I partied. I got caught
stealing a couple times. okay?

714
00:54:30.851 --> 00:54:34.553
But that's it. the rest is
just all part of their

715
00:54:34.647 --> 00:54:36.272
plan to keep me a prisoner.

716
00:54:36.357 --> 00:54:39.725
You want me to believe you
over an official file?

717
00:54:39.819 --> 00:54:43.696
-Really?
-Don't do this. Rusty. please.

718
00:54:44.824 --> 00:54:47.232
I'm a small town cop.

719
00:54:47.326 --> 00:54:49.827
My number one call is cattle
blocking the road.

720
00:54:52.665 --> 00:54:54.623
I'm trying to do the
best I can here.

721
00:54:57.169 --> 00:54:59.169
Yeah.

722
00:54:59.255 --> 00:55:02.715
I never asked you to help me.
my sister did.

723
00:55:05.386 --> 00:55:06.969
I never asked for any of this.

724
00:55:41.756 --> 00:55:43.380
I was worried sick.

725
00:55:50.848 --> 00:55:52.181
What happened?

726
00:55:52.266 --> 00:55:53.682
I thought I told you girls
to stay put.

727
00:55:53.768 --> 00:55:55.893
Yeah. I know. I needed
to get something.

728
00:55:55.978 --> 00:55:57.311
What happened?

729
00:55:57.438 --> 00:55:59.304
Madison. how well
do you know your sister?

730
00:55:59.398 --> 00:56:00.814
What are you saying?

731
00:56:00.941 --> 00:56:02.358
Sounded pretty clear.

732
00:56:02.443 --> 00:56:04.151
I know her heart.

733
00:56:04.278 --> 00:56:06.987
I know she's not perfect.
but she's not capable of--

734
00:56:07.114 --> 00:56:08.480
What. are you sure?

735
00:56:08.574 --> 00:56:10.482
Yeah. I am.

736
00:56:10.576 --> 00:56:13.619
Look at all that's happened.
I'll take her word for it.

737
00:56:13.704 --> 00:56:15.954
And. Rusty. you should
take mine. she trusted you.

738
00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:17.623
Do you know how fragile
she is right now?

739
00:56:17.708 --> 00:56:19.157
This is my job

740
00:56:19.251 --> 00:56:21.335
and I have to walk away
from certain things.

741
00:56:21.462 --> 00:56:23.170
Don't give me that.

742
00:56:23.297 --> 00:56:24.713
There's right. there's wrong

743
00:56:24.799 --> 00:56:26.164
and that's it. Rusty.

744
00:56:26.258 --> 00:56:27.999
I know you understand
what that means.

745
00:56:28.094 --> 00:56:29.593
You tell me right now.
you look at that girl

746
00:56:29.678 --> 00:56:31.169
and you see a murderer?

747
00:56:31.263 --> 00:56:32.671
Honestly. right now I don't
know what to think.

748
00:56:32.765 --> 00:56:33.847
Then screw you. Rusty.

749
00:56:33.974 --> 00:56:35.349
You wanna go inside
and arrest her?

750
00:56:35.476 --> 00:56:37.768
That's fine. get ready
to arrest me as well.

751
00:56:46.862 --> 00:56:48.237
Selma. honey?

752
00:56:49.573 --> 00:56:51.615
Selma. come talk to me.

753
00:56:55.496 --> 00:56:57.704
Selma?

754
00:57:10.261 --> 00:57:11.969
Rusty!

755
00:57:12.054 --> 00:57:13.846
-What. what's wrong?
-She's gone.

756
00:57:13.931 --> 00:57:16.348
-What are you talking about?
-She's not in the house.

757
00:57:18.436 --> 00:57:19.852
She's not in the house?

758
00:57:20.938 --> 00:57:22.312
Madison?

759
00:57:26.986 --> 00:57:29.361
Oh. dammit. this is my fault.

760
00:57:29.447 --> 00:57:31.029
-Rusty.
-No. I gotta go find her.

761
00:57:31.115 --> 00:57:32.823
-She couldn't have gotten far.
-I'm coming with you.

762
00:57:32.908 --> 00:57:34.825
If there's anything Selma knows
how to do. it's how to run.

763
00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:37.903
No I need you to stay here.
in case she comes back.

764
00:57:37.997 --> 00:57:39.738
I'm the one that screwed
this up. just let me go

765
00:57:39.832 --> 00:57:41.239
find her and lock everything up

766
00:57:41.333 --> 00:57:42.541
and don't go anywhere.

767
00:57:42.626 --> 00:57:43.959
Okay.

768
00:57:44.044 --> 00:57:47.245
Hey. Rusty. I'm sorry
I snapped at you.

769
00:57:47.339 --> 00:57:48.839
I-I know you're a good man.

770
00:57:48.924 --> 00:57:51.758
Please just-just find her
and keep her safe.

771
00:57:51.886 --> 00:57:53.093
I will.

772
00:58:15.534 --> 00:58:17.242
Thank you.

773
00:58:21.874 --> 00:58:23.790
I'll find another ride out.
thanks.

774
00:59:01.247 --> 00:59:06.291
Hey. Darlene. I told you.
you gotta stop working so late.

775
00:59:15.386 --> 00:59:16.802
Hey. Darlene?

776
00:59:38.617 --> 00:59:41.526
Hey. hey. you tell
your a little friend.

777
00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:44.121
got some special of hers.
something really special.

778
00:59:46.292 --> 00:59:48.199
Let's go. come on.

779
01:00:14.903 --> 01:00:20.032
Yeah. nowhere left to
go. I'm cold. I'm done running.

780
01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:30.125
Oh.

781
01:00:31.879 --> 01:00:35.213
-Hey.
-Oh. Rusty. look at you.

782
01:00:36.717 --> 01:00:38.675
You should see the other guys.

783
01:00:40.721 --> 01:00:42.420
Just take it easy. okay?

784
01:00:42.514 --> 01:00:44.222
We're gonna get you
to a hospital.

785
01:00:44.308 --> 01:00:45.932
Can-can you walk?

786
01:00:47.686 --> 01:00:49.353
Yeah. just-just help me up.

787
01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:55.609
All right. slow.

788
01:01:00.824 --> 01:01:04.275
I didn't wanna believe it.
but it was them.

789
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:06.495
They're the ones who did
this to me. I know it.

790
01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:10.615
They said they had
something of yours.

791
01:01:12.044 --> 01:01:13.418
Maddy's all alone.
give me your phone.

792
01:01:13.504 --> 01:01:15.212
It's in my back pocket.

793
01:01:17.383 --> 01:01:18.840
Just wait here.

794
01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:31.311
Hello?

795
01:01:31.438 --> 01:01:32.688
Oh. thank God.

796
01:01:32.773 --> 01:01:36.975
Selma. I'm so happy you're okay.

797
01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:38.527
I need you to check the house.

798
01:01:39.655 --> 01:01:40.904
Uh..

799
01:01:42.783 --> 01:01:44.449
I don't...

800
01:01:44.535 --> 01:01:46.827
-I don't want to.
-You have to.

801
01:01:46.954 --> 01:01:49.996
Okay.

802
01:02:30.497 --> 01:02:32.205
There's nothing.
what's going on?

803
01:02:32.332 --> 01:02:33.915
They found us.

804
01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:37.043
I'm with Rusty.

805
01:02:37.171 --> 01:02:38.754
I'm traveling to you right now.

806
01:02:41.133 --> 01:02:43.800
Maddy's okay.
what did they mean?

807
01:02:43.886 --> 01:02:47.345
I don't know. but they-they
did say something else.

808
01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:48.880
What?

809
01:02:48.974 --> 01:02:50.599
"Very special."

810
01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:58.064
They took Willow. I know it.

811
01:03:01.445 --> 01:03:02.903
I'm calling for backup.

812
01:03:03.030 --> 01:03:04.562
-We can go after them.
-Back up?

813
01:03:04.656 --> 01:03:06.490
You said it takes hours
for them to get here.

814
01:03:08.827 --> 01:03:12.913
Selma. I can't-I can't
help you like this.

815
01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.332
We just have to wait.

816
01:03:15.417 --> 01:03:16.625
I'm not waiting.

817
01:03:24.426 --> 01:03:29.387
This is Deputy Rusty Harris
at 6435 Anchor Street.

818
01:03:29.473 --> 01:03:30.922
Officer requesting backup.

819
01:03:31.016 --> 01:03:32.423
-What happened?
-Rusty. Madison. look at me...

820
01:03:32.518 --> 01:03:34.392
-Look at me. He's fine. okay?
-Rusty.

821
01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:37.020
All right. help is on the way.
but we have to go now.

822
01:03:40.442 --> 01:03:42.934
I think they have Willow.

823
01:03:43.028 --> 01:03:44.694
What are you talking about?

824
01:03:46.406 --> 01:03:48.281
-Call her.
-What?

825
01:03:48.408 --> 01:03:49.783
I'm so sorry.

826
01:04:00.212 --> 01:04:03.880
If you go out there.
you'll be on your own.

827
01:04:05.717 --> 01:04:08.793
Yeah. well. they just want me.

828
01:04:08.887 --> 01:04:11.388
and I don't care
what happens to me anymore.

829
01:04:11.473 --> 01:04:12.806
I care.

830
01:04:27.781 --> 01:04:31.908
A man. a man answered
Willow's phone.

831
01:04:31.994 --> 01:04:36.121
They're... they're gonna call
back with instructions.

832
01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:40.792
They said to start-start
driving West.

833
01:04:40.878 --> 01:04:44.662
We will get her back. Maddy.
I swear to you. okay?

834
01:04:44.756 --> 01:04:47.424
I will give my life
for your daughter.

835
01:04:47.509 --> 01:04:49.217
Come on. let's go. come on.

836
01:05:11.867 --> 01:05:13.408
Oh. my God.
Oh. my God.

837
01:05:13.493 --> 01:05:15.327
Look. you can stay here. okay?

838
01:05:15.412 --> 01:05:17.537
I-I have to--

839
01:05:17.664 --> 01:05:20.874
I can do this alone. okay?
I'll get her.

840
01:05:21.001 --> 01:05:22.667
No. no. that is my daughter.

841
01:05:22.753 --> 01:05:24.419
I'm going in.

842
01:05:26.214 --> 01:05:27.872
Okay.

843
01:05:43.982 --> 01:05:46.107
- Willow!
- Mom!

844
01:05:48.987 --> 01:05:52.489
-Give me my daughter.
-Mom!

845
01:05:52.574 --> 01:05:54.032
Mom!

846
01:05:54.117 --> 01:05:55.533
- Mom!
- See?

847
01:05:55.619 --> 01:05:57.568
-That wasn't so hard.
-I'm here now. okay?

848
01:05:57.663 --> 01:05:59.737
I'm all yours.
you just let her go.

849
01:05:59.831 --> 01:06:03.083
Selma. straight to business.
And after all these years.

850
01:06:03.210 --> 01:06:05.168
Don't do that.
I'm not the same person.

851
01:06:05.253 --> 01:06:07.745
I can see that.

852
01:06:07.839 --> 01:06:10.507
And I really never... never
pegged you for your smarts.

853
01:06:10.592 --> 01:06:12.750
Happy to have your approval.

854
01:06:12.844 --> 01:06:14.585
I think we're finished here.

855
01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:17.755
Quit stalling and
give me my daughter.

856
01:06:25.565 --> 01:06:27.065
Out.

857
01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:35.156
Oh. God.
come here. baby.

858
01:06:37.869 --> 01:06:39.444
Did they hurt you. are you okay?

859
01:06:39.538 --> 01:06:41.955
Come on. we're not animals.

860
01:06:42.082 --> 01:06:43.614
Are they free to go?

861
01:06:43.709 --> 01:06:47.752
If you ever breathe a word
of this to anyone...

862
01:06:47.838 --> 01:06:49.787
I think it's safe to say
you know damn well

863
01:06:49.881 --> 01:06:51.631
what we're capable of.

864
01:06:53.093 --> 01:06:55.343
We're gonna make
your life a living hell.

865
01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:58.805
Everybody's still going think
we the good guys.

866
01:06:58.932 --> 01:07:02.967
But. Selma. I think we all know
you don't part ways here.

867
01:07:03.061 --> 01:07:05.136
It's over with them. right?

868
01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:09.065
Yeah. of course. our business
has only been with you.

869
01:07:09.151 --> 01:07:10.525
I mean. they didn't even
need to get involved

870
01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:13.811
if you would've just
known your place.

871
01:07:13.905 --> 01:07:16.647
Go. Maddy. I'm sorry. I ever
brought this into your home.

872
01:07:16.742 --> 01:07:19.317
Selma. Selma. I can't leave you.

873
01:07:19.411 --> 01:07:21.152
I'm okay with this.

874
01:07:21.246 --> 01:07:22.987
Go. go.

875
01:07:30.088 --> 01:07:32.997
-Now what?
-Now we go home.

876
01:07:33.091 --> 01:07:34.332
I can't have you running
around with all

877
01:07:34.426 --> 01:07:35.833
the things you know about us.

878
01:07:35.927 --> 01:07:37.844
-If you would have just--
-Just what?

879
01:07:37.971 --> 01:07:39.670
Huh?

880
01:07:39.765 --> 01:07:41.556
What. are you just gonna
forget about it all?

881
01:07:42.976 --> 01:07:45.727
About Jason. your husband?

882
01:07:45.812 --> 01:07:48.063
'Cause we haven't forgotten...

883
01:07:48.148 --> 01:07:49.939
and I think it's time
for some atonement.

884
01:07:56.448 --> 01:07:58.156
Are you just gonna
leave her here?

885
01:07:59.576 --> 01:08:01.618
Mom!

886
01:08:01.703 --> 01:08:04.204
No. no. no. I'm not.
I'm not leaving her.

887
01:08:05.916 --> 01:08:08.374
Listen to me. you have your
learner's permit. okay?

888
01:08:08.502 --> 01:08:12.370
Listen. I want you to take
the car and drive. don't stop.

889
01:08:12.464 --> 01:08:14.422
I can't. I'm scared.

890
01:08:14.508 --> 01:08:17.708
I believe in you.
you are a bright. young woman.

891
01:08:17.803 --> 01:08:20.303
I just wish I told you
that more often.

892
01:08:20.388 --> 01:08:21.879
Come on.

893
01:08:24.976 --> 01:08:27.352
Go.

894
01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:33.774
So...

895
01:08:36.737 --> 01:08:39.063
it's time to re-break you.

896
01:08:39.157 --> 01:08:42.233
I'm done begging. whatever you
gotta do to me. I'm ready.

897
01:08:42.327 --> 01:08:46.287
Oh. i-it won't be me. I mean.
we brought in a specialist.

898
01:08:55.841 --> 01:08:58.133
Oh. my sweet little Selma.

899
01:09:00.137 --> 01:09:01.594
No.

900
01:09:05.559 --> 01:09:07.767
You look like you've
just seen a ghost.

901
01:09:09.228 --> 01:09:10.770
I shot you.

902
01:09:13.233 --> 01:09:15.567
And just like everything else...

903
01:09:17.696 --> 01:09:20.938
you screwed that up. too.
didn't you?

904
01:09:21.032 --> 01:09:24.075
Come on. I already told you.
you're mine forever. baby.

905
01:09:24.161 --> 01:09:25.610
I'm not gonna let you go.

906
01:09:25.703 --> 01:09:28.279
There's nowhere you
can hide from me.

907
01:09:28.372 --> 01:09:33.501
but we're gonna have
so much fun together. okay?

908
01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:37.046
Yeah. we are. I'm gonna do
everything that I can

909
01:09:37.131 --> 01:09:39.549
just to make sure
that our love...

910
01:09:41.344 --> 01:09:43.844
feels that much more intense
this time. okay?

911
01:09:46.057 --> 01:09:49.133
I'm gonna go finish up with
the boys and then you and me.

912
01:09:49.227 --> 01:09:51.019
we're going home.

913
01:10:22.469 --> 01:10:25.169
-What time's the drop off?
-This week or next week?

914
01:10:25.263 --> 01:10:27.513
-This week.
-7:30.

915
01:10:27.641 --> 01:10:30.350
- Who's picking it up?
- This week's?

916
01:10:30.477 --> 01:10:32.518
- This week.
- John.

917
01:10:32.646 --> 01:10:34.270
How about next week?

918
01:10:34.356 --> 01:10:36.013
Next week?
Who's picking it up next week?

919
01:10:36.107 --> 01:10:37.514
Now where's it being picked up?

920
01:10:37.609 --> 01:10:39.517
-This week or next week?
-This week.

921
01:10:39.611 --> 01:10:42.362
-7:30.
-How about next week?

922
01:10:42.489 --> 01:10:44.855
Next week. what time next week?

923
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:46.282
It's grade-A stuff. no. right?

924
01:10:46.368 --> 01:10:47.659
Yeah. it's a clean package.

925
01:10:48.995 --> 01:10:50.702
Hey. check that out.

926
01:11:13.353 --> 01:11:15.895
Hey. come on.
it's nothing. let's go.

927
01:12:15.874 --> 01:12:18.291
What are doing here?

928
01:12:20.712 --> 01:12:23.954
I told you.
I'll never fail you again.

929
01:12:24.049 --> 01:12:25.673
Maddy. this is my mess.
not yours.

930
01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:29.460
-Where the hell is Willow?
-I had her drive away.

931
01:12:37.187 --> 01:12:38.770
Hurry. hurry!

932
01:12:51.534 --> 01:12:54.410
All right. so I'm guessing
we're on foot?

933
01:12:54.496 --> 01:12:55.820
I'm afraid so.

934
01:12:57.499 --> 01:13:01.209
-Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom!
-Oh. my God. Willow!

935
01:13:06.925 --> 01:13:08.925
Willow. what are you doing here?

936
01:13:09.010 --> 01:13:10.468
Drive.

937
01:13:24.818 --> 01:13:26.818
Stop. Stop.

938
01:13:34.786 --> 01:13:36.527
I'm getting real
tired of this.

939
01:13:36.621 --> 01:13:39.330
Don't you dare touch them.

940
01:13:47.674 --> 01:13:49.048
Mom!

941
01:13:50.427 --> 01:13:53.302
Mom. mom. are you okay?

942
01:13:53.388 --> 01:13:55.555
Maddy. where's your inhaler?

943
01:13:55.682 --> 01:13:57.380
It's in the car.

944
01:13:57.475 --> 01:13:59.559
Maddy. I need you
to calm down. okay?

945
01:14:02.397 --> 01:14:04.555
Breathe.

946
01:14:04.648 --> 01:14:06.724
Breathe with me. okay?
Just like that.

947
01:14:06.818 --> 01:14:08.860
Are those men gonna kill us?

948
01:14:08.945 --> 01:14:12.071
Mom. Mom. please. Mom!

949
01:14:12.198 --> 01:14:13.906
-Maddy. look at me.
-Mom?

950
01:14:14.032 --> 01:14:15.867
Breathe with me. okay?

951
01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:18.870
Breathe.

952
01:14:20.498 --> 01:14:22.999
Dammit. someone get her inhaler!

953
01:14:34.679 --> 01:14:36.219
Don't be so dramatic. okay?

954
01:14:37.514 --> 01:14:38.923
The three of you here.
you're gonna

955
01:14:39.017 --> 01:14:41.091
be in a ditch
soon enough anyways.

956
01:14:41.186 --> 01:14:44.312
You worthless cowards.
this is not over.

957
01:14:49.903 --> 01:14:51.861
Whatever you say. sweetheart.

958
01:14:59.913 --> 01:15:01.579
Can we shut them up now?

959
01:15:01.664 --> 01:15:03.831
It's getting old.

960
01:15:03.916 --> 01:15:07.084
Yeah. yeah. I'll take
care of this one.

961
01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:09.795
-We'll finish up the hole.
-Okay.

962
01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:16.293
Well...

963
01:15:16.387 --> 01:15:19.138
I guess our time
has come to an. uh...

964
01:15:20.642 --> 01:15:21.933
an end.

965
01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:31.275
My sweet little Selma.

966
01:15:40.245 --> 01:15:41.786
I truly love you.

967
01:15:59.722 --> 01:16:01.097
Selma.

968
01:16:04.227 --> 01:16:06.102
You wouldn't.

969
01:16:06.187 --> 01:16:08.187
I shot you once before.
you bastard. I'll do it again.

970
01:16:09.773 --> 01:16:11.849
My mom looks really bad.

971
01:16:11.943 --> 01:16:13.359
I'm gonna get us
outta here.

972
01:16:13.486 --> 01:16:14.684
I won't let you die. Maddy.

973
01:16:14.779 --> 01:16:17.487
How. huh?

974
01:16:19.157 --> 01:16:20.907
How. Selma?

975
01:16:20.994 --> 01:16:22.827
My guys are just right outside.

976
01:16:23.788 --> 01:16:28.282
I'm gonna use you.

977
01:16:31.796 --> 01:16:32.920
Don't try anything.

978
01:16:36.467 --> 01:16:37.800
Hey. yo.

979
01:16:48.187 --> 01:16:50.271
Easy. fellas. easy.

980
01:16:54.152 --> 01:16:57.987
I need the inhaler.
in the car. Go.

981
01:17:04.202 --> 01:17:06.077
Now get the inhaler in there.

982
01:17:17.508 --> 01:17:20.384
Right now. I want you
to slowly put in my hand.

983
01:17:25.475 --> 01:17:26.891
Oops.

984
01:17:37.904 --> 01:17:39.779
Good night.

985
01:17:42.575 --> 01:17:44.617
- Drop the gun. drop it!
- -Let me see your hands!

986
01:17:44.744 --> 01:17:46.110
Drop it!

987
01:17:48.206 --> 01:17:50.121
Drop it!

988
01:17:52.251 --> 01:17:53.959
-You got him?
-Yep.

989
01:17:55.630 --> 01:17:56.879
You okay?

990
01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:00.925
Madison.

991
01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:02.593
Madison! Madison!

992
01:18:17.902 --> 01:18:19.985
Come on. Maddy.

993
01:18:20.112 --> 01:18:22.905
-Come on. Maddy.
-We have EMT on its way.

994
01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:24.615
Come on. Maddy.

995
01:18:26.327 --> 01:18:28.994
Maddy. please.

996
01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:31.914
Please. Maddy.
don't do this. please.

997
01:18:31.999 --> 01:18:33.499
Come on.

998
01:18:43.302 --> 01:18:45.803
Thank you for showing up
when you did.

999
01:18:45.888 --> 01:18:47.722
My brother gave me a call.

1000
01:18:47.807 --> 01:18:49.764
Pretty smart move
you taking his phone.

1001
01:18:55.565 --> 01:18:57.231
Hey. come on. let's go.

1002
01:18:58.359 --> 01:19:01.018
Help is on the way. okay?

1003
01:19:01.112 --> 01:19:02.695
All I need is you.

1004
01:19:48.409 --> 01:19:49.992
You should be at a hospital.

1005
01:19:50.077 --> 01:19:51.535
Right. and miss all this?

1006
01:19:51.621 --> 01:19:55.121
Forget it.
How you holding up?

1007
01:19:55.208 --> 01:19:57.249
Just some bumps and bruises.
I'll live.

1008
01:19:58.710 --> 01:20:02.379
I met your sister.
you never mentioned her.

1009
01:20:02.465 --> 01:20:05.007
Yeah. she'll never let me
live this down.

1010
01:20:07.219 --> 01:20:08.844
You did good. Selma.

1011
01:20:10.223 --> 01:20:11.597
Real good.

1012
01:20:14.018 --> 01:20:16.227
Look. you let me know if you
ever need anything. all right?

1013
01:20:26.364 --> 01:20:27.571
Hey. deputy.

1014
01:20:31.202 --> 01:20:32.910
I could use a ride.

1015
01:20:33.955 --> 01:20:35.779
Come on.

1016
01:20:44.173 --> 01:20:47.299
So. I was thinking I could go
skiing with my friends

1017
01:20:47.425 --> 01:20:50.386
over winter break.
what do you think?

1018
01:20:50.471 --> 01:20:52.596
Well. it's cool with me
if it's cool with your father.

1019
01:20:55.184 --> 01:20:57.893
-What?
-Hey.

1020
01:20:57.978 --> 01:20:59.803
-Hey!
-Hi!

1021
01:20:59.897 --> 01:21:01.480
-Hey. guys.
-Hi!

1022
01:21:01.607 --> 01:21:03.639
Hope you saved room
for dessert.

1023
01:21:03.734 --> 01:21:04.775
We brought some wine.

1024
01:21:06.571 --> 01:21:10.948
- How are you?
- -My favorite.

1025
01:21:11.032 --> 01:21:12.282
-Thank you.
-Hello. beautiful.

1026
01:21:12.368 --> 01:21:14.034
I see you brought the pie.

1027
01:21:26.591 --> 01:21:31.635
So. you're doing it? California?

1028
01:21:31.721 --> 01:21:33.512
Yeah.

1029
01:21:33.639 --> 01:21:35.264
Sounds nice. doesn't it?

1030
01:21:36.767 --> 01:21:39.268
Well. we leave tomorrow.

1031
01:21:40.438 --> 01:21:43.480
I'm with another cop.

1032
01:21:43.566 --> 01:21:45.232
He's a good one.

1033
01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:48.568
I'm happy for you.

1034
01:21:52.407 --> 01:21:54.700
I wanna thank you. Maddy.

1035
01:21:54.827 --> 01:21:59.121
Well. I'm still mad at you...
but I love you more than ever.

1036
01:22:01.459 --> 01:22:05.535
I just hate that you're leaving.
now that I have you back.

1037
01:22:05.630 --> 01:22:06.962
Well. look on the bright side.

1038
01:22:07.048 --> 01:22:09.505
there will be a lot less
trouble around here.

1039
01:22:11.052 --> 01:22:13.177
We'll see about that.

1040
01:22:13.262 --> 01:22:14.553
Yeah.

1041
01:22:16.766 --> 01:22:18.182
I'll be back.

1042
01:22:19.936 --> 01:22:22.386
And no matter where I am.

1043
01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:26.357
I will always be her sister.
and that's forever.
