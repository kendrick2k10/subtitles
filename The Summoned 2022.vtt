00:02:40.467 --> 00:02:43.831
- To Joplyn Rose
and guest.

4
00:02:43.866 --> 00:02:45.701
That's my favorite part
by the way.

5
00:02:45.736 --> 00:02:47.439
- Okay.

6
00:02:47.474 --> 00:02:50.970
- And guest. The
estimable Dr. Justus Frost

7
00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:54.545
summons you to join him
at the Staufen House.

8
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.415
I've never been summoned
to therapy before.

9
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.746
- Well. that's
because the Staufen House

10
00:02:57.781 --> 00:02:58.582
isn't just therapy.

11
00:02:58.617 --> 00:02:59.814
It's actually a-

12
00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:00.448
- Exclusive mental
health program

13
00:03:00.483 --> 00:03:02.718
designed to set you free.

14
00:03:02.753 --> 00:03:04.390
Yeah. it says it on the back.

15
00:03:04.425 --> 00:03:06.854
- It's a really big
deal. okay?

16
00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:08.559
All the famouses swear by it.

17
00:03:08.594 --> 00:03:10.264
There's like a two year
waiting list

18
00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.430
to even get into this shit.

19
00:03:11.465 --> 00:03:13.300
- Of course. of course.

20
00:03:13.335 --> 00:03:15.731
Hey. I've read about this
Frost guy. by the way.

21
00:03:15.766 --> 00:03:17.304
- Yeah. What'd you read?

22
00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:18.372
- That he's super strange.

23
00:03:18.407 --> 00:03:20.307
that his patients are
sworn to secrecy. that...

24
00:03:20.342 --> 00:03:21.506
- Okay. well.
I can tell you

25
00:03:21.541 --> 00:03:23.475
that he has changed people's
lives. okay?

26
00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.004
People that I know.

27
00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:28.414
He's eccentric. but it works.

28
00:03:30.517 --> 00:03:32.715
I'm just saying the coupon
was a much better gift

29
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:33.782
than you're giving me
credit for.

30
00:03:33.817 --> 00:03:34.882
- And I'm just saying.

31
00:03:34.917 --> 00:03:36.686
it sounds like some white
people shit.

32
00:03:36.721 --> 00:03:38.325
- Well. no argument there.

33
00:03:40.791 --> 00:03:43.759
- Uh-oh. Oh.
hold on now .

34
00:03:43.794 --> 00:03:46.696
- All right. you don't
have to do this every time.

35
00:03:46.731 --> 00:03:47.764
- I'm proud of you.

36
00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:48.431
- You know I've
had my songs on the radio

37
00:03:48.466 --> 00:03:50.568
since I was like 14. right?

38
00:03:50.603 --> 00:03:53.472
- Lyn. look. I'm
excited about the new album.

39
00:03:53.507 --> 00:03:57.003
Babe. these songs. I don't
know. they feel special.

40
00:03:57.038 --> 00:03:58.906
- Yeah. they always do.

41
00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:02.382
- Hey wait.
stop. Pull over.

42
00:04:02.417 --> 00:04:03.779
- What? Why?

43
00:04:03.814 --> 00:04:05.077
- They might need help?

44
00:04:05.112 --> 00:04:06.914
- No. Elijah. Not our help.

45
00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:09.389
- Lyn. Lyn. come on. Lyn.

46
00:04:11.492 --> 00:04:12.788
- Oh my God. Okay.

47
00:04:12.823 --> 00:04:13.789
Okay. Fine.

48
00:04:17.597 --> 00:04:19.498
This doesn't look
ominous at all.

49
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.667
- I'll be right back.

50
00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:33.941
Hello?

51
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.389
Anyone here?

52
00:05:11.585 --> 00:05:12.452
- Oh.

53
00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:16.049
Hey man. you need a hand?

54
00:05:18.724 --> 00:05:20.856
Looks like you're having
a little bit of trouble.

55
00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:25.927
Cool. Cool.

56
00:05:25.962 --> 00:05:29.062
Well. sorry to bother you.

57
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:30.899
Hey come on-

58
00:05:30.934 --> 00:05:31.669
- Where are you going?

59
00:05:35.609 --> 00:05:36.476
- Is everything okay?

60
00:05:41.714 --> 00:05:42.977
- I'm sorry.

61
00:05:43.012 --> 00:05:43.945
I'm so. so sorry.

62
00:05:52.956 --> 00:05:55.022
- Who the fuck was that guy?

63
00:05:55.057 --> 00:05:57.057
- No fucking clue.

64
00:05:57.092 --> 00:05:58.564
- Come on. let's get outta here.

65
00:05:58.599 --> 00:05:59.466
- Jesus.

66
00:06:07.003 --> 00:06:09.102
Whoa. is that it?

67
00:06:09.137 --> 00:06:10.873
- That's it.

68
00:06:10.908 --> 00:06:13.040
- Damn.
Look at this place.

69
00:06:15.077 --> 00:06:16.846
Ooh. Sexy-ass car too.

70
00:06:17.915 --> 00:06:19.486
- What?

71
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:20.553
- I offered
to get you

72
00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:21.917
anything you want for Christmas.

73
00:06:21.952 --> 00:06:23.985
"I don't know. just gimme
some coupons or something."

74
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.822
- Well. I wasn't going
to ask you to buy me a car.

75
00:06:25.857 --> 00:06:27.219
- Why not?

76
00:06:27.254 --> 00:06:28.891
- Because I
can buy my own damn car.

77
00:06:29.894 --> 00:06:32.499
...and plus. I love the coupons.

78
00:06:34.096 --> 00:06:34.963
- Okay.

79
00:06:37.132 --> 00:06:37.999
You ready?

80
00:06:41.103 --> 00:06:41.970
- Let's go.

81
00:06:43.842 --> 00:06:44.676
- All right.

82
00:07:03.895 --> 00:07:05.059
- Holy shit. Lyn?

83
00:07:06.766 --> 00:07:08.601
- Joe? No way.

84
00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:10.636
- I haven't seen you since what?
New York?

85
00:07:10.671 --> 00:07:11.835
- Yeah. it was one

86
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.804
of those ridiculous
launch parties of yours.

87
00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:15.201
- It wasn't a launch.
it was an IPO.

88
00:07:15.236 --> 00:07:17.170
- Oh I'm so sorry. an IPO.

89
00:07:17.205 --> 00:07:18.677
- Yeah. I made a lot of money
on that one.

90
00:07:18.712 --> 00:07:19.711
- Mm-hmm.

91
00:07:19.746 --> 00:07:21.240
How are you?

92
00:07:21.275 --> 00:07:23.176
I mean. aside from knocking out
platinum records every year.

93
00:07:23.211 --> 00:07:24.650
- I'm good. Yeah.

94
00:07:24.685 --> 00:07:26.916
Working on the next one
as we speak.

95
00:07:26.951 --> 00:07:28.555
What are you in for?

96
00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.085
- Well. I got divorced
again this year.

97
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.559
- Oh. I'm so sorry.

98
00:07:32.594 --> 00:07:33.186
- Nah. it's fine.

99
00:07:33.221 --> 00:07:34.253
It's the fourth one.

100
00:07:34.288 --> 00:07:35.892
Getting pretty good at
it by now.

101
00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:38.532
Nah. I thought maybe it was time

102
00:07:38.567 --> 00:07:40.259
I did some work on myself. so...

103
00:07:40.294 --> 00:07:41.634
Plus I was summoned.

104
00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:43.834
- Well. can't say no to
that can you?

105
00:07:43.869 --> 00:07:44.901
- Nope.

106
00:07:44.936 --> 00:07:45.605
- What about you?

107
00:07:46.872 --> 00:07:49.675
- Oh. I'm just trying to be
less broken

108
00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:50.940
so I don't lose this one.

109
00:07:50.975 --> 00:07:52.843
- Ah. there's really no
risk of that.

110
00:07:52.878 --> 00:07:54.174
- Hey man. Joe Agrippa.

111
00:07:54.209 --> 00:07:56.682
- Oh shit. yeah.

112
00:07:56.717 --> 00:07:58.717
No. I knew I recognized you.

113
00:07:58.752 --> 00:08:00.719
Lyn just gave me your
book for my birthday.

114
00:08:00.754 --> 00:08:03.590
Wow. You're like real-life
"Iron Man" or something.

115
00:08:03.625 --> 00:08:04.316
- Well...

116
00:08:04.351 --> 00:08:05.757
- I didn't know you knew him.

117
00:08:05.792 --> 00:08:07.825
- Oh yeah. Elijah. I
kind of know Joe Agrippa.

118
00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.123
- It's nice to meet
you too. man.

119
00:08:10.291 --> 00:08:11.290
What do you do?

120
00:08:11.325 --> 00:08:13.567
- Oh. nothing fancy.

121
00:08:13.602 --> 00:08:16.295
I'm a mechanic.
I run my granddad's shop.

122
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.330
- He's actually an
amazing musician as well.

123
00:08:18.365 --> 00:08:19.166
- Oh. really?

124
00:08:19.201 --> 00:08:19.969
Anything I've heard?

125
00:08:20.004 --> 00:08:21.971
- No. God. no. no.

126
00:08:22.006 --> 00:08:24.006
I tried for a little bit

127
00:08:24.041 --> 00:08:28.175
and didn't have whatever
it takes I guess...

128
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:29.814
Which is fine.
I'm happy running the shop.

129
00:08:29.849 --> 00:08:31.211
- Hey. there's nothing wrong

130
00:08:31.246 --> 00:08:33.015
with being a small
business owner.

131
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:35.589
That's how I started and
now I own three planes.

132
00:08:35.624 --> 00:08:37.151
You never know what can happen.

133
00:08:37.186 --> 00:08:41.056
In fact.
I may have something for you.

134
00:08:41.091 --> 00:08:42.596
Yeah. let's talk later.

135
00:08:42.631 --> 00:08:44.125
- Wow. Really?

136
00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.929
I mean. yeah. okay.

137
00:08:45.964 --> 00:08:46.798
I'd love that.

138
00:08:46.833 --> 00:08:47.293
- Good.

139
00:08:48.934 --> 00:08:49.867
How are you Lyn?

140
00:08:49.902 --> 00:08:51.000
- I'm good.

141
00:08:51.035 --> 00:08:52.100
- Did I mention you look great?

142
00:08:52.135 --> 00:08:53.167
- Oh I don't
think you did.

143
00:08:53.202 --> 00:08:54.300
- Well. you really do.

144
00:08:54.335 --> 00:08:55.741
- Do what?

145
00:08:55.776 --> 00:08:56.368
- Look great.

146
00:08:56.403 --> 00:08:58.271
- Why. thank you.

147
00:08:58.306 --> 00:09:00.306
The secret is crushing
self doubt.

148
00:09:00.341 --> 00:09:03.111
- You're a lucky man.

149
00:09:03.146 --> 00:09:04.244
Better lock that up soon.

150
00:09:05.885 --> 00:09:07.951
- Oh. I'm definitely trying.

151
00:09:12.925 --> 00:09:14.859
- Of course. a limo.

152
00:09:14.894 --> 00:09:16.157
- Oh. you're fine.

153
00:09:16.192 --> 00:09:18.665
- Here we are bitches.

154
00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.997
The Staufen House. Oh my God.

155
00:09:21.032 --> 00:09:23.736
I have been waiting to be
summoned here

156
00:09:23.771 --> 00:09:25.298

inner goddess. you know?

159
00:09:29.678 --> 00:09:30.974
- Whoa. is that Tara Grandier?

160
00:09:31.009 --> 00:09:32.206
- I think it is.

161
00:09:32.241 --> 00:09:33.680
- Oh shit.
it's my therapy buddies.

162
00:09:33.715 --> 00:09:35.847
Hey kids. smile for the camera!

163
00:09:38.885 --> 00:09:41.281
Fuck. Why the fuck are you here?

164
00:09:41.316 --> 00:09:42.656
- To get over the shit you
put me through.

165
00:09:42.691 --> 00:09:43.822
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you back.

166
00:09:43.857 --> 00:09:45.692
- I'd rather deep-throat
a fucking harpoon.

167
00:09:45.727 --> 00:09:46.385
- Have at it.

168
00:09:47.894 --> 00:09:51.797
- Oh shit. Joplyn Rose.

169
00:09:51.832 --> 00:09:54.360
I am such a huge fan of
your music.

170
00:09:54.395 --> 00:09:55.295
- Oh come on. just call me Lyn.

171
00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:56.934
- Ah. girl.

172
00:09:56.969 --> 00:09:58.705
That last single about
being stuck in something

173
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.740
like. I don't know.
like honey or...?

174
00:10:00.775 --> 00:10:03.138
- Yeah it was a murder ballad
about being stuck in honey.

175
00:10:03.173 --> 00:10:03.974
- Yes.

176
00:10:04.009 --> 00:10:05.778
I loved it.

177
00:10:05.813 --> 00:10:07.945
It's like something. something
I'm stuck in honey...

178
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.947
- I literally never say the
word honey.

179
00:10:09.982 --> 00:10:12.213
- I. I'm sorry Miss Grandier.

180
00:10:12.248 --> 00:10:13.918
I don't mean to make this weird.

181
00:10:13.953 --> 00:10:15.788
but like a month.
like a month ago.

182
00:10:15.823 --> 00:10:17.757
a month ago. Lyn showed
me a bunch of your movies.

183
00:10:17.792 --> 00:10:19.088
Wow. Ah man.

184
00:10:19.123 --> 00:10:20.386
I'm sorry. I'm geeking.

185
00:10:20.421 --> 00:10:22.289
I. I just cannot believe
I'm meeting Tara Grandier.

186
00:10:22.324 --> 00:10:23.224
- Sweetie. sweetie.

187
00:10:23.259 --> 00:10:24.291
Don't apologize.

188
00:10:24.326 --> 00:10:26.128
I love meeting my fans.

189
00:10:26.163 --> 00:10:27.800
What was your favorite movie?

190
00:10:27.835 --> 00:10:30.066
- Oh. well I.
I loved "Paganini."

191
00:10:30.101 --> 00:10:33.135
- Oh yeah.
The one where I show my tits.

192
00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:34.301
Real cool dude.

193
00:10:34.336 --> 00:10:35.775
- No. no.

194
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:37.843
I. I'm. I'm sorry ma'am. miss.

195
00:10:37.878 --> 00:10:41.110
I. I'm not... you're
acting is what I was...

196
00:10:41.145 --> 00:10:42.309
- I'm just fucking with you.

197
00:10:42.344 --> 00:10:43.981
I'm so glad you liked it
.

198
00:10:45.215 --> 00:10:47.413
Where do I know you from?

199
00:10:47.448 --> 00:10:48.821
- You ever get your
brakes checked?

200
00:10:48.856 --> 00:10:50.086
- What do you mean?

201
00:10:50.121 --> 00:10:51.219
Were you in like. a
car movie or something?

202
00:10:51.254 --> 00:10:52.726
- No. I'm a mechanic.

203
00:10:52.761 --> 00:10:54.893
- Oh. can you imagine

204
00:10:54.928 --> 00:10:58.028
- No. that's actually what I do.

205
00:10:58.063 --> 00:10:59.733
- Elijah and I are dating.

206
00:10:59.768 --> 00:11:01.163
- Oh. Oh. okay.

207
00:11:01.198 --> 00:11:01.999
That makes sense.

208
00:11:02.034 --> 00:11:03.495
No. see. I just.

209
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:05.233
I've been waiting so long
to. you know. come here

210
00:11:05.268 --> 00:11:07.235
and it'd be kind of bullshit
if you. that's all I'm saying.

211
00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:09.039
- Right. No. yeah.

212
00:11:09.074 --> 00:11:10.106
It's all thanks to Lyn.

213
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:15.309
We are here to work on some
of our stuff.

214
00:11:16.477 --> 00:11:19.753
- He is such a button.
I just love him so much.

215
00:11:19.788 --> 00:11:22.250
- Oh. thank you.

216
00:11:22.285 --> 00:11:23.449
- All right bitches.

217
00:11:23.484 --> 00:11:25.154
let's go change our
motherfucking lives.

218
00:11:28.093 --> 00:11:31.193
I'm not fucking you this time
no matter how much you beg.

219
00:11:38.235 --> 00:11:40.136
- I didn't think wife number
two would be at therapy.

220
00:11:40.171 --> 00:11:41.500
but why not?

221
00:11:48.047 --> 00:11:50.080
- Hey. are you okay?

222
00:11:50.115 --> 00:11:51.510
- Yeah. Yeah.

223
00:11:51.545 --> 00:11:55.888
They're just so famous.

224
00:11:55.923 --> 00:11:57.021
- This's your last chance
to turn around

225
00:11:57.056 --> 00:11:57.890
and go get a burger.

226
00:12:00.587 --> 00:12:02.257
- No. no.

227
00:12:02.292 --> 00:12:03.929
No. it's gonna be awesome.

228
00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:06.866
Let's do it.

229
00:12:06.901 --> 00:12:07.526
- All right.

230
00:12:24.919 --> 00:12:26.347
- Good taste.

231
00:12:26.382 --> 00:12:28.514
- How many times a day do you
jerk off to your own book?

232
00:12:28.549 --> 00:12:30.021
- As many times as I need to.

233
00:12:30.056 --> 00:12:31.286
- Hmm.

234
00:12:31.321 --> 00:12:33.827
- Hey. that book really
helped me actually.

235
00:12:33.862 --> 00:12:35.895
- You see. he's already more
supportive in 10 minutes

236
00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:37.996
than you were in our
entire marriage.

237
00:12:38.031 --> 00:12:40.031
- Oh cool. Maybe you
should cheat on him too.

238
00:12:40.066 --> 00:12:42.297
- Is this gonna be like a whole
weekend thing with you guys?

239
00:12:42.332 --> 00:12:43.199
- Probably.

240
00:13:02.055 --> 00:13:04.220
- Modern art bullshit.

241
00:13:04.255 --> 00:13:05.419
Never really understood it.

242
00:13:07.489 --> 00:13:08.422
What part helped you?

243
00:13:09.623 --> 00:13:10.897
Of the book. I mean.

244
00:13:10.932 --> 00:13:12.591
- Oh. I know it's weird.

245
00:13:12.626 --> 00:13:14.934
but I actually love the
story behind the title.

246
00:13:14.969 --> 00:13:16.364
the guy who tricked the Devil.

247
00:13:16.399 --> 00:13:18.267
- The guy who tricked the Devil?

248
00:13:20.535 --> 00:13:21.501
- I wrote it while we
were together

249
00:13:21.536 --> 00:13:23.503
and she never even read it.

250
00:13:23.538 --> 00:13:26.077
- His name was Wagner. right?

251
00:13:26.112 --> 00:13:28.244
He made a deal with the Devil.

252
00:13:28.279 --> 00:13:30.213
He'd trade his soul in exchange

253
00:13:30.248 --> 00:13:32.545
for having his boots
filled with gold every week

254
00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:34.514
but then he cut the bottoms
off the boots

255
00:13:34.549 --> 00:13:36.956
so they couldn't get full.

256
00:13:36.991 --> 00:13:38.551
The Devil couldn't fulfill
his side of the bargain.

257
00:13:38.586 --> 00:13:40.421
So he couldn't take
Wagner's soul.

258
00:13:41.259 --> 00:13:42.621
- Hmm.

259
00:13:42.656 --> 00:13:43.930
Whoever wrote that is a
terrible writer

260
00:13:43.965 --> 00:13:44.524
and should probably
kill himself.

261
00:13:44.559 --> 00:13:45.492
- I didn't make it up.

262
00:13:45.527 --> 00:13:47.263
It's a legend you idiot.

263
00:13:47.298 --> 00:13:48.968
- Kind of a strange choice.

264
00:13:49.003 --> 00:13:51.630
Writing a self-help book
about Satan.

265
00:13:51.665 --> 00:13:53.500
- Well. people say don't
make a deal with the Devil.

266
00:13:53.535 --> 00:13:55.238
I say. fuck the Devil.

267
00:13:55.273 --> 00:13:58.439
Be smarter than him.
be crueler. be meaner.

268
00:13:58.474 --> 00:14:00.342
make the deal. just win it.

269
00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:02.982
You know what I mean?

270
00:14:03.017 --> 00:14:03.950
- I think so. Yeah.

271
00:14:10.156 --> 00:14:11.485
- So Lyn. didn't you-

272
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.422
- I. I was just gonna say
you guys should get together

273
00:14:14.457 --> 00:14:18.932
at some point this weekend
and chat about business.

274
00:14:18.967 --> 00:14:20.527
Maybe you can get a
car like his after all.

275
00:14:27.503 --> 00:14:29.107
- All right bitches.

276
00:14:29.142 --> 00:14:29.808
If I gotta be stuck with
my ex for three days.

277
00:14:29.843 --> 00:14:31.978
we're gonna motherfucking drink.

278
00:14:49.327 --> 00:14:54.099
- Friends. visitors.
esteemed guests.

279
00:15:03.737 --> 00:15:07.277
- Welcome to the Staufen House.

280
00:15:09.248 --> 00:15:13.580
I am your host and guide Dr.
Justus Frost

281
00:15:13.615 --> 00:15:16.187
and over the next three days.

282
00:15:16.222 --> 00:15:19.421
we will embark upon a
journey that will alter

283
00:15:19.456 --> 00:15:24.096
what is possible for you and
your lives within each of you.

284
00:15:24.131 --> 00:15:28.067
We will create a new realm of
possibility.

285
00:15:28.102 --> 00:15:32.533
One wit. one atom.
one scintilla at a time

286
00:15:32.568 --> 00:15:37.406
until you will finally
discover your true potential.

287
00:15:41.445 --> 00:15:43.181
Please. come. join me.

288
00:15:43.216 --> 00:15:45.150
I will show you to your rooms.

289
00:16:06.239 --> 00:16:09.669
Do not love the world. for
everything in the world.

290
00:16:12.245 --> 00:16:15.708
lust of the flesh.
lust of the eyes.

291
00:16:17.151 --> 00:16:21.516
and the pride of life.
lives not in the father.

292
00:16:22.453 --> 00:16:23.617
but in the world.

293
00:16:25.258 --> 00:16:27.621
That was John. in- 16.

294
00:16:28.756 --> 00:16:30.723
It's rather poorly written
if you ask me.

295
00:16:34.234 --> 00:16:37.136
From birth.
humans are conditioned

296
00:16:37.171 --> 00:16:41.800
to believe that our desires.
our wants. our needs.

297
00:16:42.242 --> 00:16:45.144
our very existence is
somehow corrupt.

298
00:16:46.312 --> 00:16:51.150
We are baptized in shame
and in shame we live.

299
00:16:52.285 --> 00:16:56.386
Cowering from the monsters
of our own desires.

300
00:16:56.421 --> 00:16:59.719
But as we creep cautiously
through our lives.

301
00:16:59.754 --> 00:17:04.394
trying to be good. those
who do not. flourish.

302
00:17:06.695 --> 00:17:09.498
Do not love the world.
the Bible tells us.

303
00:17:10.699 --> 00:17:12.666
To love it is to sin.

304
00:17:14.571 --> 00:17:15.438
To sin.

305
00:17:19.675 --> 00:17:24.513
Is there anything more damaging
than the false idea of sin?

306
00:17:29.322 --> 00:17:32.686
While here you will be
unshackled

307
00:17:32.721 --> 00:17:36.723
from your doubts. your
guilt. your self-loathing.

308
00:17:38.463 --> 00:17:40.793
And you will find out
who it is you truly are.

309
00:17:42.896 --> 00:17:44.335
We have a lot of work to do.

310
00:17:45.404 --> 00:17:46.700
Your room is through there.

311
00:17:46.735 --> 00:17:48.240
Miss Grandier. yours is there.

312
00:17:48.275 --> 00:17:51.705
Mr. Agrippa. Miss Rose.
yours are below.

313
00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:54.246
Please. get comfortable.

314
00:17:54.281 --> 00:17:56.314
I will call when the
festivities begin.

315
00:17:56.349 --> 00:18:00.747
- I. I prefer to stay with
Lyn actually.

316
00:18:02.355 --> 00:18:03.420
- I'm afraid not.

317
00:18:04.852 --> 00:18:07.358
We are doing hard emotional
work. Mr. Moulton.

318
00:18:08.526 --> 00:18:12.297
We must be given time
to process in solitude.

319
00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.861
Come. follow me.

320
00:18:20.868 --> 00:18:22.472
- Don't worry. babe.

321
00:18:22.507 --> 00:18:23.671
I'll sneak up in a bit.

322
00:18:37.621 --> 00:18:40.886
Hey. can I ask you a question?

323
00:18:43.858 --> 00:18:45.759
What do you think of my tits?

324
00:18:45.794 --> 00:18:46.661
- I'm sorry?

325
00:18:46.696 --> 00:18:48.465
- In the movie.

326
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.864
- Oh. they were...

327
00:18:53.505 --> 00:18:54.900
very nice.

328
00:18:54.935 --> 00:18:56.242
- But like if you were
to put a number on them.

329
00:18:56.277 --> 00:18:57.342
- A number?
- Yeah.

330
00:18:57.377 --> 00:18:59.377
- A number.
- Yeah.

331
00:18:59.412 --> 00:18:59.938
- A number.

332
00:19:02.008 --> 00:19:05.548
Nine? and half?

333
00:19:06.683 --> 00:19:08.386
Or. I'm sorry.

334
00:19:08.421 --> 00:19:10.883
I'm. I'm a little uncomfortable.
I'm with Lyn. so...

335
00:19:10.918 --> 00:19:12.324
- Oh. I know.

336
00:19:12.359 --> 00:19:13.721
Oh. oh. I'm sorry.

337
00:19:13.756 --> 00:19:14.557
I'm so sorry.

338
00:19:14.592 --> 00:19:15.624
- No. it's okay.

339
00:19:15.659 --> 00:19:16.790
Don't worry about it. Yeah.

340
00:19:16.825 --> 00:19:18.561
- Why are you two here
together though?

341
00:19:18.596 --> 00:19:21.894
- We're just. you know.
working on some issues.

342
00:19:21.929 --> 00:19:23.302
Not even issues. really. Just-

343
00:19:23.337 --> 00:19:24.699
- Oh. she wants to fuck
other people.

344
00:19:24.734 --> 00:19:26.899
- No. No. nothing.
nothing like that.

345
00:19:26.934 --> 00:19:31.244
We. I wanna get married.

346
00:19:31.279 --> 00:19:33.378
you know. have a family.
the whole thing

347
00:19:33.413 --> 00:19:36.942
and she's having some
difficulty with that.

348
00:19:36.977 --> 00:19:39.450
- Oh sweetie.
she's a fucking rock star.

349
00:19:39.485 --> 00:19:41.947
- Well. we've been together
for two years.

350
00:19:43.588 --> 00:19:44.488
- Two years?

351
00:19:44.523 --> 00:19:46.325
- Yeah.

352
00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.493
- I've never read about you
in the trades or anything.

353
00:19:49.528 --> 00:19:52.628
- Yeah you know. she's
really private about us. so.

354
00:19:53.565 --> 00:19:55.268
- Okay.

355
00:19:55.303 --> 00:19:56.863
Well I guess this weekend
it'll be a good test. huh?

356
00:19:56.898 --> 00:19:58.271
- Yeah. I guess.

357
00:19:59.769 --> 00:20:01.637
Test?

358
00:20:01.672 --> 00:20:05.773
- Oh. I mean. Joe Agrippa.
he's got a bit of a reputation.

359
00:20:05.808 --> 00:20:06.675
I would know.

360
00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:11.581
He's gonna try and fuck her.

361
00:20:15.653 --> 00:20:16.751
Hey. don't worry about it.

362
00:20:16.786 --> 00:20:18.555
If you need anything.

363
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:19.721
I'm right across the hall.

364
00:23:37.987 --> 00:23:39.118
- You don't understand.

365
00:23:40.154 --> 00:23:41.725
If this doesn't work.
it'll be the end of me.

366
00:23:53.068 --> 00:23:54.001
- Hey.

367
00:23:55.301 --> 00:23:56.168
Hey!

368
00:24:00.878 --> 00:24:01.745
Wait.

369
00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.700
- No no no. You've had years.

370
00:24:28.741 --> 00:24:29.707
We had a plan.

371
00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.139
We've already he made a
promise to him.

372
00:24:33.174 --> 00:24:35.240
If we fail. we are doomed.

373
00:24:35.275 --> 00:24:36.549
Do you understand?

374
00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:39.783
You will do as we planned.

375
00:25:20.386 --> 00:25:24.960
I do not like little lambs
skipping about my halls.

376
00:25:24.995 --> 00:25:27.028
listening to my secrets.

377
00:25:28.163 --> 00:25:29.932
You're not ready yet.

378
00:25:29.967 --> 00:25:32.869
But you will be brought
to slaughter soon enough.

379
00:25:34.169 --> 00:25:35.608
- Hey. hey. whoa.

380
00:25:36.402 --> 00:25:37.203
- Lyn.

381
00:25:37.238 --> 00:25:38.710
- You okay?

382
00:25:38.745 --> 00:25:40.338
- Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

383
00:25:40.373 --> 00:25:41.746
- Hmm.

384
00:25:41.781 --> 00:25:44.342
I was texting you.
knocking on the door.

385
00:25:46.819 --> 00:25:48.621
Kind of got me worried
about you.

386
00:25:48.656 --> 00:25:51.250
- Sorry. I must have passed out.

387
00:25:53.155 --> 00:25:57.993
- Okay. well. Frost wants
us to meet downstairs.

388
00:25:58.963 --> 00:26:00.259
- It's like- 00 AM.

389
00:26:00.294 --> 00:26:04.736
- Mm-hm. A lovely fireside
chat is what he said.

390
00:26:06.234 --> 00:26:07.838
- All right.

391
00:26:07.873 --> 00:26:09.004
- Yeah?
- See you down there.

392
00:26:09.039 --> 00:26:09.708
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

393
00:26:17.916 --> 00:26:18.882
- You sure you're okay?

394
00:26:20.215 --> 00:26:21.247
- Frost gives me the creeps.

395
00:26:23.119 --> 00:26:26.692
- Listen. if it gets any
weirder. we just dip out.

396
00:26:27.728 --> 00:26:28.386
- Cool.

397
00:26:30.423 --> 00:26:32.159
- Put that on.
- What? What is this?

398
00:26:41.137 --> 00:26:42.774
- Well.
maybe if you followed

399
00:26:42.809 --> 00:26:44.336
the fucking script instead
of fucking improvising you...

400
00:26:44.371 --> 00:26:45.205
- Hey.

401
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.107
- Hey.

402
00:26:47.847 --> 00:26:49.044
- What are you guys
talking about?

403
00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:53.917
- Just some bitches who
cost me an Oscar

404
00:26:53.952 --> 00:26:55.446
because they decided to
go off script

405
00:26:55.481 --> 00:26:56.854
on the day of shooting.

406
00:26:56.889 --> 00:26:59.153
- Did you sleep well Mr.
Moulton?

407
00:26:59.188 --> 00:27:00.352
- Fine. thanks.

408
00:27:00.387 --> 00:27:02.123
- Good. Please sit.

409
00:27:02.158 --> 00:27:04.796
Enjoy the beverage by the fire.

410
00:27:15.237 --> 00:27:17.875
Historically. the night was

411
00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:20.339
a particularly difficult
time for humanity.

412
00:27:26.116 --> 00:27:30.085
It was in the middle of the
night that my mother drowned me.

413
00:27:33.057 --> 00:27:34.254
That's who she was.

414
00:27:35.521 --> 00:27:38.764
Question is. who are you?

415
00:27:40.966 --> 00:27:41.426
- Drowned you?

416
00:27:43.034 --> 00:27:43.901
- Indeed.

417
00:27:47.434 --> 00:27:48.268
- And?

418
00:27:49.436 --> 00:27:51.469
- And now I am no
longer drowned.

419
00:27:55.112 --> 00:27:56.210
The lust of the flesh.

420
00:27:57.917 --> 00:28:01.248
lust of the eyes and the
pride of life.

421
00:28:02.988 --> 00:28:07.452
The three great sins within
which all others reside.

422
00:28:07.487 --> 00:28:10.895
Touch no one. want nothing

423
00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:15.361
and do not under any
circumstances take pride
in yourself.

424
00:28:20.467 --> 00:28:25.008
I would like each of you
to focus on your own sin

425
00:28:26.946 --> 00:28:31.377
and then if you wish.
share it with us.

426
00:28:39.222 --> 00:28:40.419
- Okay. Okay.

427
00:28:42.863 --> 00:28:44.258
I love my shit.

428
00:28:44.293 --> 00:28:48.163
I love my planes. I love
my boats. I love my cars.

429
00:28:48.198 --> 00:28:50.264
I just fucking love being rich.

430
00:28:50.299 --> 00:28:52.200
Probably too much.
- Definitely too much.

431
00:28:52.235 --> 00:28:54.939
- Yes. "The Lust of Eyes".

432
00:28:54.974 --> 00:28:56.974
To enjoy the things you have.

433
00:28:57.009 --> 00:28:59.141
but then to want more.

434
00:28:59.176 --> 00:29:03.541
This we are told is some kind
of cruel immoral failure.

435
00:29:08.317 --> 00:29:12.891
- Oh....

436
00:29:14.257 --> 00:29:17.588
If. If I could.

437
00:29:17.623 --> 00:29:22.131
I would marry cocaine
and Vicodin

438
00:29:22.166 --> 00:29:25.200
and ice cream and
pizza and sushi

439
00:29:25.235 --> 00:29:27.598
and cocaine and. and cocaine.

440
00:29:27.633 --> 00:29:29.270
- You said that one.

441
00:29:29.305 --> 00:29:30.205
- And sex.

442
00:29:33.309 --> 00:29:34.440
I guess that's bad.

443
00:29:34.475 --> 00:29:35.375
- Yes.

444
00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:38.950
Enjoy nothing. Want nothing.

445
00:29:38.985 --> 00:29:41.447
Cage yourself in purity.

446
00:29:41.482 --> 00:29:43.988
"The Lust of The Flesh".

447
00:29:44.023 --> 00:29:45.220
Thank you. Miss Grandier.

448
00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:52.029
Miss Rose.
any sins you wish to discuss?

449
00:29:55.496 --> 00:29:57.397
- I think I'm good.

450
00:30:00.369 --> 00:30:02.105
- Are you sure?

451
00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:02.941
- Mm-hm.

452
00:30:02.976 --> 00:30:04.140
- There's nothing at all?

453
00:30:05.308 --> 00:30:06.175
- No.

454
00:30:07.178 --> 00:30:08.881
- Okay.

455
00:30:08.916 --> 00:30:10.476
- She's not ready yet.

456
00:30:10.511 --> 00:30:11.917
It's perfectly acceptable.

457
00:30:13.481 --> 00:30:14.381
Mr. Moulton?

458
00:30:16.352 --> 00:30:17.450
- I don't know.

459
00:30:17.485 --> 00:30:21.586
I try to live morally. I guess.

460
00:30:23.161 --> 00:30:25.458
- Elijah fancies himself
as somewhat of a hero.

461
00:30:25.493 --> 00:30:26.558
- Not a hero.

462
00:30:29.101 --> 00:30:30.595
- I wonder if Miss Rose.

463
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:34.533
you would give us the pleasure
of playing one of your songs.

464
00:30:34.568 --> 00:30:37.239
Music is the great lubricant.

465
00:30:37.274 --> 00:30:40.242
It can often take us to places
we refuse to go ourselves.

466
00:30:41.542 --> 00:30:45.511
Perhaps some music will help
you and Mr. Moulton dig deeper.

467
00:30:48.417 --> 00:30:49.988
- Yeah. sure.

468
00:30:50.023 --> 00:30:51.121
- No. Wait. wait.

469
00:30:51.156 --> 00:30:52.452
Didn't you say you were
a musician?

470
00:30:52.487 --> 00:30:53.253
- No. Not really.

471
00:30:53.288 --> 00:30:54.289
- Oh. well I wanna
hear you play.

472
00:30:54.324 --> 00:30:55.455
- No. no.

473
00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:57.061
I think it makes much more sense

474
00:30:57.096 --> 00:30:59.591
to hear Joplyn Rose sing
than the guy dating her.

475
00:30:59.626 --> 00:31:01.065
- Come on Rick. have some balls.

476
00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:01.560
Take a risk.

477
00:31:04.103 --> 00:31:05.531
- His name is Elijah.
you jack-ass.

478
00:31:06.699 --> 00:31:07.940
- Sorry. Elijah.

479
00:31:09.405 --> 00:31:11.339
- "The Pride of Life".

480
00:31:11.374 --> 00:31:14.474
Arrogance. boasting.
showmanship.

481
00:31:15.741 --> 00:31:19.479
Is that the sin you've been
taught to fear most Mr. Moulton?

482
00:31:22.616 --> 00:31:24.385
- A little. I guess.

483
00:31:28.028 --> 00:31:29.291
- Let's do your song.

484
00:31:29.326 --> 00:31:30.457
- No. I don't.
I don't think they wanna-

485
00:31:30.492 --> 00:31:31.491
- Yeah. play.

486
00:31:31.526 --> 00:31:33.361
- Yeah. Come on. Come on.

487
00:31:33.396 --> 00:31:35.000
- Come on dude.
Just play it.

488
00:31:38.401 --> 00:31:40.467
- All right. Woo!

489
00:31:40.502 --> 00:31:41.270
- All right.

490
00:31:41.305 --> 00:31:42.502
Why not?

491
00:31:45.045 --> 00:31:46.143

- Jesus Tara.

524
00:34:35.545 --> 00:34:36.907
- Anybody sounds good

525
00:34:36.942 --> 00:34:38.546
when they get to sing with Lyn.

526
00:34:38.581 --> 00:34:41.384
- You cannot accept that you
are talented. Mr. Moulton.

527
00:34:41.419 --> 00:34:42.616
- Well no. I can. I...

528
00:34:42.651 --> 00:34:43.485
- Just say it.

529
00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:44.783
- Say what?

530
00:34:44.818 --> 00:34:45.586
- Say you're a
good musician.

531
00:34:45.621 --> 00:34:46.422
- I'm a good musician.

532
00:34:46.457 --> 00:34:47.456
- Aw. come on. Mean it.

533
00:34:47.491 --> 00:34:48.292
- I do.

534
00:34:48.327 --> 00:34:48.959
- Really?

535
00:34:48.995 --> 00:34:50.261
- The pride of life.

536
00:34:50.296 --> 00:34:51.427
- Anybody else feeling a
little weird?

537
00:34:51.462 --> 00:34:53.924
- A sin only to those who
wish to fail.

538
00:34:53.959 --> 00:34:55.530
- Okay. fine. It's a good song.

539
00:34:55.565 --> 00:34:57.598
- You can do better
than that. Mr. Moulton.

540
00:34:57.633 --> 00:34:58.830
- It's a really good song?

541
00:34:58.865 --> 00:34:59.864
- Oh. come on. dude.

542
00:34:59.899 --> 00:35:00.498
Own your shit

543
00:35:00.533 --> 00:35:02.306
- Fine. It's a great song.

544
00:35:02.341 --> 00:35:04.374
I wrote a great song.

545
00:35:04.409 --> 00:35:05.837
The best one I've ever written.

546
00:35:05.872 --> 00:35:07.905
It should be on Lyn's
next album.

547
00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:09.676
It's good enough.

548
00:35:09.711 --> 00:35:11.942
Better than some of the
stuff you do now.

549
00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:16.188
- No. go ahead.

550
00:35:16.223 --> 00:35:17.849
- Oh shit. there it is.

551
00:35:17.884 --> 00:35:19.356
- I offered to record
it with you.

552
00:35:19.391 --> 00:35:21.688
- No. Lyn.
you didn't offer as much as say

553
00:35:21.723 --> 00:35:24.922
it was the kind of song
that could be on the album.

554
00:35:24.957 --> 00:35:26.231
- Well. you didn't ask either.

555
00:35:26.266 --> 00:35:27.727
- I didn't want to take
advantage.

556
00:35:27.762 --> 00:35:29.399
- We've been dating for two
years. Elijah.

557
00:35:29.434 --> 00:35:30.829
if you can't talk to me
about this kind of shit.

558
00:35:30.864 --> 00:35:32.303
I don't even know what
the fuck we're doing.

559
00:35:32.338 --> 00:35:33.304
- Oh. so I can ride
your coattails to fame.

560
00:35:33.339 --> 00:35:35.372
but the minute I talk
about marriage. you...

561
00:35:35.407 --> 00:35:37.275
- Oh. you're gonna do that now?

562
00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:38.142
You're gonna do that now?
- Yeah.

563
00:35:38.178 --> 00:35:38.910
- Right now.
that's what you wanna do?

564
00:35:38.945 --> 00:35:39.772
- That's why we're here.
isn't it?

565
00:35:41.479 --> 00:35:42.676
- I don't wanna talk
about our relationship

566
00:35:42.711 --> 00:35:43.809
in front of strangers

567
00:35:43.844 --> 00:35:45.382
at three o'clock in the
fucking morning.

568
00:35:45.417 --> 00:35:47.516
- You don't wanna talk
about our relationship ever.

569
00:35:47.551 --> 00:35:49.782
Not in front of strangers.
not with me.

570
00:35:49.817 --> 00:35:51.850
You're so scared of
accidentally committing to me

571
00:35:51.885 --> 00:35:52.584
that you don't say-
- You know what?

572
00:35:52.619 --> 00:35:54.688
I'm gonna. I'm gonna go to bed.

573
00:35:54.723 --> 00:35:57.427
- No... Come...

574
00:35:57.462 --> 00:35:58.329
Damn it.

575
00:36:00.465 --> 00:36:01.860
Come on Lyn.

576
00:36:01.895 --> 00:36:03.829
- We are here to grow.
Mr. Moulton.

577
00:36:05.701 --> 00:36:07.371
Let her have her time.

578
00:36:07.406 --> 00:36:09.637
without the ever present
specter of you.

579
00:36:09.672 --> 00:36:11.507
- What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

580
00:36:11.542 --> 00:36:14.411
- Hey. I. I'll go talk to her.
all right?

581
00:36:17.944 --> 00:36:18.811
- Good work.

582
00:36:25.952 --> 00:36:30.394
- Well. I guess therapy is over.

583
00:36:30.429 --> 00:36:33.023
- I don't trust that guy.

584
00:36:33.058 --> 00:36:35.267
- Something is off about him.

585
00:36:35.302 --> 00:36:36.961
- Yeah. He's probably a
con artist.

586
00:36:36.996 --> 00:36:37.863
They all are.

587
00:36:40.307 --> 00:36:42.967
Hey. hey.

588
00:36:43.002 --> 00:36:44.243
You don't look too good.

589
00:36:45.444 --> 00:36:46.542
Want to talk upstairs?

590
00:36:46.577 --> 00:36:47.246
- Yes.

591
00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:48.907
- Come on.

592
00:37:02.857 --> 00:37:04.956
- What do you want for
yourself. Elijah?

593
00:37:04.991 --> 00:37:07.365
- God. I feel like I'm the
only one getting therapy here.

594
00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:09.631
- Just making
conversation.

595
00:37:09.666 --> 00:37:11.435
Consider this our business talk.

596
00:37:12.834 --> 00:37:14.306
- I don't know.

597
00:37:14.341 --> 00:37:17.639
I. I do wish I could have
been a musician.

598
00:37:17.674 --> 00:37:19.542
- You know the difference
between you and Lyn?

599
00:37:19.577 --> 00:37:20.543
- Talent.

600
00:37:20.578 --> 00:37:21.874
- Money.

601
00:37:21.909 --> 00:37:24.041
Her whole family's crazy rich.

602
00:37:24.076 --> 00:37:26.846
She could try and fail
for as long as she wants.

603
00:37:26.881 --> 00:37:28.815
She doesn't have to worry
about anything.

604
00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:30.553
Her life will never be
uncomfortable.

605
00:37:31.985 --> 00:37:34.689
I'm guessing you didn't have
that luxury.

606
00:37:34.724 --> 00:37:36.020
I didn't either.

607
00:37:36.055 --> 00:37:37.923
- So how'd you do it?

608
00:37:37.958 --> 00:37:38.924
- I cheated the Devil.

609
00:37:38.959 --> 00:37:40.332
- Huh.

610
00:37:40.367 --> 00:37:43.060
- Elijah.
I got a proposition for you.

611
00:37:43.095 --> 00:37:45.700
I need to put some money
into something. quickly.

612
00:37:45.735 --> 00:37:47.867
And I'll be upfront.
it's not exactly legal.

613
00:37:47.902 --> 00:37:50.903
but hey. anything's legal
if you don't get caught.

614
00:37:50.938 --> 00:37:53.807
- I'm sorry. I. I just
need a. I need a second.

615
00:37:53.842 --> 00:37:55.776
- Let me invest in you.

616
00:37:55.811 --> 00:37:59.351
- Invest in? What do you mean?

617
00:37:59.386 --> 00:38:01.353
- I could buy your little
car business

618
00:38:01.388 --> 00:38:03.718
for two. two and a half million.

619
00:38:04.886 --> 00:38:05.885
- I don't. I don't understand.

620
00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:06.919
Why. why would you do that?

621
00:38:06.954 --> 00:38:08.921
- Because I like you.

622
00:38:08.956 --> 00:38:10.923
I think you're talented.

623
00:38:10.958 --> 00:38:12.925
- I don't know man.

624
00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.861
- I saw you looking at my car.

625
00:38:14.896 --> 00:38:15.730
You like it?

626
00:38:15.765 --> 00:38:16.830
You can have it.

627
00:38:16.865 --> 00:38:18.128
Part of the deal.

628
00:38:18.163 --> 00:38:21.098
- I don't want to get
mixed up into anything.

629
00:38:21.133 --> 00:38:23.474
- Okay. Hero complex. I get it.

630
00:38:23.509 --> 00:38:26.675
But just so you know.
no one will know

631
00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:29.007
and it's fucking two and a
half million.

632
00:38:31.484 --> 00:38:32.714
- Can I talk to Lyn first?

633
00:38:33.618 --> 00:38:34.485
- Sure.

634
00:38:36.753 --> 00:38:38.852
Attaboy. Get some rest.

635
00:38:38.887 --> 00:38:40.018
You look like shit.

636
00:39:23.701 --> 00:39:24.634
What part helped you?

637
00:40:24.696 --> 00:40:25.563
- Lyn?

638
00:40:46.212 --> 00:40:49.785
Hey Tara. have you seen Lyn?

639
00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:54.251
- Uh. yes. She and Joe
went to go get alcohol.

640
00:40:55.925 --> 00:40:58.057
- I'm gonna go find them.

641
00:40:58.092 --> 00:41:01.698
- Hey. are you okay?

642
00:41:05.803 --> 00:41:08.133
- No. No.

643
00:41:09.202 --> 00:41:10.839
I'm pretty fucked up actually.

644
00:41:10.874 --> 00:41:13.677
I've been having weird
dreams and last night-

645
00:41:13.712 --> 00:41:15.712
- You passed out. yeah.

646
00:41:15.747 --> 00:41:17.648
Joe and I found you outside.

647
00:41:17.683 --> 00:41:19.210
- I don't know what the
hell that was.

648
00:41:20.818 --> 00:41:24.281
- When Joe was cheating
on me. I was a total mess.

649
00:41:24.316 --> 00:41:25.788
It's amazing what anxiety
can do to you.

650
00:41:25.823 --> 00:41:27.526
- Lyn is not cheating on me.

651
00:41:30.927 --> 00:41:32.157
- No. I know.

652
00:41:32.192 --> 00:41:34.027
I'm just saying that.
that if you need to talk.

653
00:41:35.294 --> 00:41:37.602
- Thanks I. thank you.

654
00:41:39.133 --> 00:41:40.297
Did she say when they would be-

655
00:41:45.876 --> 00:41:46.974
when they uh...

656
00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:49.647
Where's Frost?

657
00:41:49.682 --> 00:41:52.243
- Exploring the three great sins

658
00:41:52.278 --> 00:41:54.311
wherein all other sins reside.

659
00:41:56.788 --> 00:41:59.250
Hey. since everyone's gone.
you wanna hang out with me?

660
00:42:06.358 --> 00:42:07.258
- No. thanks.

661
00:42:35.321 --> 00:42:36.188
- Hey!

662
00:42:38.764 --> 00:42:39.224
Hey! Wait!

663
00:42:42.867 --> 00:42:43.734
Hey!

664
00:42:47.806 --> 00:42:48.233
Wait!

665
00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:51.203
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

666
00:42:55.044 --> 00:42:56.648
- You can't stop it.

667
00:42:56.683 --> 00:42:57.979
You can't stop it.

668
00:43:01.248 --> 00:43:02.115
- Wait.

669
00:43:49.494 --> 00:43:51.065
- What are you doing out here?

670
00:43:52.805 --> 00:43:53.265
- Just a.

671
00:43:58.877 --> 00:43:59.337
nature walk.

672
00:44:01.275 --> 00:44:02.373
- Is everything okay?

673
00:44:03.849 --> 00:44:08.115
- I uh. wish you would've
told me you left.

674
00:44:10.383 --> 00:44:12.988
- Well. you kind of disappeared.

675
00:44:13.023 --> 00:44:13.890
Thought you didn't wanna see me.

676
00:44:13.925 --> 00:44:15.221
- Of course I wanna see you.

677
00:44:15.256 --> 00:44:16.794
Yeah. I'm sorry about earlier-

678
00:44:16.829 --> 00:44:18.323
- Hey. fun drive right?

679
00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:20.127
- Oh.

680
00:44:24.001 --> 00:44:26.331
Yeah. yeah. It was.
it was great.

681
00:44:27.532 --> 00:44:28.333
Thanks again.

682
00:44:28.368 --> 00:44:29.235
- No problem.

683
00:44:30.942 --> 00:44:32.975
- Hey. feeling better man?

684
00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:33.844
- Not really.

685
00:44:33.879 --> 00:44:34.944
- Ah. that's too bad.

686
00:44:34.979 --> 00:44:38.376
Oh hey.
I told Lyn about the deal.

687
00:44:38.411 --> 00:44:39.278
She's excited.

688
00:44:41.216 --> 00:44:44.250
- Actually. I don't think I
was thinking clearly earlier.

689
00:44:44.285 --> 00:44:45.988
- Oh yeah?

690
00:44:46.023 --> 00:44:46.483
- Yeah.

691
00:44:48.091 --> 00:44:51.290
- Hey. hey. second thoughts
are totally natural.

692
00:44:51.325 --> 00:44:53.963
But you should know I already
have someone else interested.

693
00:44:53.998 --> 00:44:55.426
- Really?

694
00:44:55.461 --> 00:44:56.867
- Yeah. Just called
him a little while ago.

695
00:44:56.902 --> 00:44:58.066
So if you're sure you
don't want it.

696
00:44:58.101 --> 00:44:59.837
I'm gonna go ahead and call-

697
00:44:59.872 --> 00:45:01.773
- I really appreciate the offer.
I just...

698
00:45:01.808 --> 00:45:04.402
- Okay. okay. No pressure.

699
00:45:04.437 --> 00:45:06.305
I just wanted to help.

700
00:45:07.979 --> 00:45:09.407
You wanna beer?

701
00:45:09.442 --> 00:45:12.212
- Hmm. maybe later.

702
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:15.050
I'm gonna go nap.

703
00:45:16.581 --> 00:45:20.220
I'll uh. I'll see you in a bit?

704
00:45:20.255 --> 00:45:21.221
- Yeah. yeah.

705
00:45:21.256 --> 00:45:22.860
In a second.

706
00:45:22.895 --> 00:45:23.795
- Cool.

707
00:45:47.546 --> 00:45:49.887
- Enjoying your stay so far.
Mr. Moulton?

708
00:45:52.892 --> 00:45:55.156
- I don't think we're
gonna stay. actually.

709
00:45:55.191 --> 00:45:59.127
- No? Not your cup of tea?

710
00:46:00.394 --> 00:46:03.362
This is life. Mr. Moulton.

711
00:46:03.397 --> 00:46:08.235
You either seize your chances
or you linger in mediocrity.

712
00:46:11.603 --> 00:46:14.109
You've the world at your
fingertips.

713
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.626
- Yeah. that's what I mean.

714
00:46:36.661 --> 00:46:38.265
But I can't right now.

715
00:46:39.235 --> 00:46:40.201
- Hey. wait.

716
00:46:41.941 --> 00:46:45.107
Hey wait. Hey. wait. Joe.

717
00:46:45.142 --> 00:46:45.607
- What up?

718
00:46:47.342 --> 00:46:48.374
- I changed my mind.

719
00:46:52.083 --> 00:46:53.885
- This is not a good way to
start a business relationship.

720
00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:57.053
- Yeah. I'm sorry.
but I wanna do it.

721
00:46:57.088 --> 00:46:59.253
I want to. Please.

722
00:47:21.948 --> 00:47:22.639
- Welcome aboard.

723
00:47:23.708 --> 00:47:25.345
You just gotta whole lot richer.

724
00:47:31.122 --> 00:47:34.486
- Hey. did you also mention
something about the car?

725
00:47:36.523 --> 00:47:37.522
- You're right. I did.

726
00:48:12.196 --> 00:48:13.294
- This has been

727
00:48:16.101 --> 00:48:18.167
such a crazy day.

728
00:48:25.209 --> 00:48:29.079
- I'm sorry if I've been
acting kind of weird.

729
00:48:29.114 --> 00:48:33.985
Just. I feel like I've been
losing my mind

730
00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:35.349
in the last few hours.

731
00:48:39.025 --> 00:48:41.157
- You know.
she's fucking him. right?

732
00:48:41.192 --> 00:48:42.125
- What the hell?

733
00:48:43.293 --> 00:48:44.358
What are you doing here?

734
00:48:44.393 --> 00:48:46.723
- Did he offer you something?

735
00:48:46.758 --> 00:48:51.266
Like a. I don't know. like
a deal or money or...?

736
00:48:51.301 --> 00:48:54.104
Yeah. Yep.

737
00:48:54.139 --> 00:48:56.106
That's what he does to
people he screws over

738
00:48:56.141 --> 00:48:57.404
to make himself feel better.

739
00:48:57.439 --> 00:48:58.537
- You're lying.

740
00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:00.572
- I really wish I was.

741
00:49:02.147 --> 00:49:04.378
I really wish this was
some kind of weird joke.

742
00:49:04.413 --> 00:49:06.611
but I got video.

743
00:49:16.524 --> 00:49:17.754
- No. no. I can't.

744
00:49:17.789 --> 00:49:19.492
I don't. I don't...

745
00:49:23.333 --> 00:49:24.431
- I'm sorry. Elijah.

746
00:49:24.466 --> 00:49:25.696
- Tara. please.

747
00:49:25.731 --> 00:49:29.568
- Hey. I know.

- Elijah!

792
00:54:50.792 --> 00:54:52.924
You know Frost is never
gonna let you leave .

793
00:54:54.598 --> 00:54:55.894
- Lyn. Lyn.

794
00:55:00.098 --> 00:55:01.636
What?

795
00:55:01.671 --> 00:55:02.670
Lyn.

796
00:55:02.705 --> 00:55:04.474
- Elijah. there you are.

797
00:55:04.509 --> 00:55:05.772
I've been looking all over
for you. man.

798
00:55:05.807 --> 00:55:07.939
I thought we should have
a talk about our future.

799
00:55:07.974 --> 00:55:09.380
Don't you think?

800
00:55:09.415 --> 00:55:10.073
I do.

801
00:55:13.419 --> 00:55:14.715
- Ready for round
two ?

802
00:55:40.512 --> 00:55:44.173
- How good are
you really Mr. Moulton?

803
00:55:49.719 --> 00:55:52.016
- The three great sins

804
00:55:52.051 --> 00:55:56.790
committed in less than two
days .

805
00:55:59.630 --> 00:56:02.026
I fear I cannot let you escape.

806
00:56:03.469 --> 00:56:05.029
Our master needs you.

807
00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:07.064
We need you.

808
00:56:49.174 --> 00:56:51.075
- I haven't been
completely honest with you.

809
00:56:51.110 --> 00:56:53.979
- Lyn. Lyn. what are you...?

810
00:57:00.152 --> 00:57:02.493
- Please put the knife down.

811
00:57:03.826 --> 00:57:08.059
- When my grandmother was
young. she lost her parents.

812
00:57:08.094 --> 00:57:11.733
Alone. poor. nowhere to go.

813
00:57:12.934 --> 00:57:13.768
She made a deal.

814
00:57:16.036 --> 00:57:17.475
She sold her soul.

815
00:57:19.677 --> 00:57:21.039
Tara's great-granddad
did the same.

816
00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:22.576
And Joe?

817
00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:25.109
Well Joe is just a greedy fuck.

818
00:57:25.144 --> 00:57:26.616
He sold his own soul

819
00:57:26.651 --> 00:57:29.718
at a tech convention in '08.
actually.

820
00:57:29.753 --> 00:57:33.689
And with it comes fame.
success. the works.

821
00:57:35.594 --> 00:57:37.990
But when you make a deal
with the Devil. Elijah.

822
00:57:38.025 --> 00:57:41.664
there are stipulations.

823
00:57:43.129 --> 00:57:43.996
- The Devil?

824
00:57:46.033 --> 00:57:49.804
- Every year on a certain
day. by a certain time.

825
00:57:50.939 --> 00:57:54.270
you are summoned to
renew the deal.

826
00:57:57.308 --> 00:57:58.549
A sacrifice.

827
00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:03.950
Someone pure of heart.

828
00:58:05.250 --> 00:58:06.623
And if you fail.

829
00:58:08.759 --> 00:58:12.794
or if you refuse then you're
sent to hell

830
00:58:12.829 --> 00:58:15.291
and the contract falls
to your next of kin.

831
00:58:16.228 --> 00:58:17.260
- No.

832
00:58:17.295 --> 00:58:18.734
No. no. no.

833
00:58:18.769 --> 00:58:20.296
Hey. Come. come on Lyn.

834
00:58:21.871 --> 00:58:22.738
- Just...

835
00:58:25.908 --> 00:58:27.270
I can't put that on my babies.

836
00:58:30.715 --> 00:58:32.814
- No. Hey. hey.

837
00:58:33.850 --> 00:58:34.783
Look at me.

838
00:58:36.688 --> 00:58:37.786
Is this what Frost is
telling you?

839
00:58:37.821 --> 00:58:40.019
- Frost doesn't make the rules.

840
00:58:42.122 --> 00:58:43.561
- Who are you here to sacrifice?

841
00:58:48.326 --> 00:58:50.601
- I was ready to let
this end with me. Elijah.

842
00:58:52.231 --> 00:58:53.637
I was. I just...

843
00:58:56.708 --> 00:58:58.070
I don't wanna go to hell.

844
00:58:58.105 --> 00:58:59.137
I'm sorry.

845
00:59:00.074 --> 00:59:01.777
- Time to go.

846
00:59:01.812 --> 00:59:02.844
- No wait.

847
00:59:05.717 --> 00:59:07.783
- I thought you
were working this guy.

848
00:59:07.818 --> 00:59:09.213
Why did it take so long?

849
00:59:09.248 --> 00:59:10.918
- Did you seriously
fall in love with the lamb?

850
00:59:10.953 --> 00:59:12.150
You dumb slut.

851
00:59:12.185 --> 00:59:14.053
Oh my God. these boots.

852
00:59:14.088 --> 00:59:15.725
- Every year is
the same thing with you.

853
00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:16.990
Buy some fucking running shoes.

854
00:59:17.025 --> 00:59:17.925
- Fuck you.

855
00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:19.025
I like to dress up for things.

856
00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:20.125
- Can you guys give it a
fucking rest?

857
00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:21.731
- Shut up bitch.

858
00:59:21.766 --> 00:59:22.598
you totally dropped the
ball this year.

859
00:59:22.634 --> 00:59:25.768
- Lyn. Please.
please don't do this.

860
00:59:25.803 --> 00:59:27.099
- It's part of the gig. man.

861
00:59:27.134 --> 00:59:28.034
It's you or us.

862
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:29.266
- You do this every year?

863
00:59:29.301 --> 00:59:30.740
- Yeah. And it's a whole thing.

864
00:59:30.775 --> 00:59:31.774
First we gotta find
someone innocent.

865
00:59:31.809 --> 00:59:32.907
get them to do the sins.

866
00:59:32.942 --> 00:59:34.271
lug their asses to the
fucking woods

867
00:59:34.306 --> 00:59:35.206
and then sacrifice them.

868
00:59:35.241 --> 00:59:37.076
I mean. it's like exhausting.

869
00:59:37.111 --> 00:59:38.649
- How many people have
you killed?

870
00:59:40.147 --> 00:59:41.410
- You're the 17th.

871
00:59:41.445 --> 00:59:44.050
- You're murderers. Let me go.

872
00:59:44.085 --> 00:59:45.821
Let me go.

873
00:59:45.856 --> 00:59:47.955
- Relax. relax.

874
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.956
Think of it this way.

875
00:59:48.991 --> 00:59:50.793
Your dying saves three people.

876
00:59:50.828 --> 00:59:51.420
It's simple math.

877
00:59:51.455 --> 00:59:52.121
- That's true.

878
00:59:52.156 --> 00:59:53.356
As long as we all draw blood.

879
00:59:53.391 --> 00:59:54.423
one death counts for all of us.

880
00:59:54.458 --> 00:59:56.062
Cool. right?

881
00:59:56.097 --> 00:59:57.129
- You don't have to do this.

882
00:59:57.164 --> 00:59:57.863
You don't have to...

883
00:59:57.898 --> 01:00:00.935
Lyn. Lyn. Lyn. I bought a ring.

884
01:00:00.970 --> 01:00:02.233
- Give it a rest. man.

885
01:00:02.268 --> 01:00:03.366
- I was gonna ask you
to marry me after this.

886
01:00:03.401 --> 01:00:04.906
- Fuck. my fucking boots.

887
01:00:04.941 --> 01:00:06.941
- Please. let me go.

888
01:00:06.976 --> 01:00:07.777
- What the fuck?

889
01:00:07.812 --> 01:00:10.241
Ah! Fuck.

890
01:00:10.276 --> 01:00:12.848
In the arm pit. really?

891
01:00:14.379 --> 01:00:15.752
- Lyn?

892
01:00:15.787 --> 01:00:16.984
- Lyn.
what the fuck are you doing?

893
01:00:17.019 --> 01:00:18.084
Ah. You fuck.

894
01:00:18.119 --> 01:00:19.888
- Run Elijah. run.

895
01:00:22.090 --> 01:00:23.826
- Lyn!

896
01:00:23.861 --> 01:00:26.158
You're gonna get us
fucking killed.

897
01:00:26.193 --> 01:00:27.192
Fuck.
- Fuck.

898
01:00:27.227 --> 01:00:28.226
- Fuck
- That fucking hurt.

899
01:00:28.261 --> 01:00:29.766
you little fucking cunt.

900
01:00:29.801 --> 01:00:30.261
- Fucking hell.

901
01:00:32.034 --> 01:00:34.067
- Get up.

902
01:01:03.802 --> 01:01:05.230
- Damn!

903
01:01:12.503 --> 01:01:13.876
- If you die. you go to hell?

904
01:01:13.911 --> 01:01:15.240
- That is none of your
concern right now.

905
01:01:15.275 --> 01:01:16.406
- Of course it is.

906
01:01:19.884 --> 01:01:20.476
I can't lose you.

907
01:01:23.481 --> 01:01:24.348
- Okay.

908
01:01:26.286 --> 01:01:28.286
You bragged at the fire.
that's pride of life.

909
01:01:28.321 --> 01:01:29.419
You took Joe's deal?

910
01:01:29.454 --> 01:01:30.453
- Yeah.
- Lust of eyes.

911
01:01:30.488 --> 01:01:31.322
And you fucked Tara?

912
01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:35.227
It's fine.
We're very good at what we do.

913
01:01:35.262 --> 01:01:37.834
Look. you committed the
three sins.

914
01:01:37.869 --> 01:01:41.266
Now we have to sacrifice you
on the altar by midnight. Okay?

915
01:01:41.301 --> 01:01:43.367
So you run and you hide.

916
01:01:43.402 --> 01:01:44.874
You just have to wait them out.

917
01:01:44.909 --> 01:01:46.975
- There's gotta be a
way out of this for you.

918
01:01:48.946 --> 01:01:49.406
- There is.

919
01:01:53.445 --> 01:01:54.246
- Lyn!

920
01:01:55.117 --> 01:01:57.788
No!

921
01:02:22.177 --> 01:02:23.341
- Wanna make out?

922
01:02:27.050 --> 01:02:31.888
- Elijah?

923
01:02:33.155 --> 01:02:33.824
Elijah?

924
01:02:43.594 --> 01:02:44.835
- Hey Elijah.

925
01:02:46.201 --> 01:02:49.433
Fuck. marry. kill the
people you met this weekend.

926
01:02:53.142 --> 01:02:57.342
Me personally. I've always
wanted to fuck Frost.

927
01:02:57.377 --> 01:03:01.412
We are baptized in shame
and in shame we live.

928
01:03:01.447 --> 01:03:04.822
I mean. tie me up and put
that cane to use daddy.

929
01:03:06.155 --> 01:03:07.451
Oh shit.

930
01:03:07.486 --> 01:03:09.288
You know what I just realized?

931
01:03:09.323 --> 01:03:11.224
I fucked you.

932
01:03:11.259 --> 01:03:15.162
I married Joe and I killed Lyn.

933
01:03:16.429 --> 01:03:18.066
I did it! .

934
01:03:18.101 --> 01:03:19.166
I completed the game.

935
01:03:19.201 --> 01:03:20.937
How many people can actually
say that?

936
01:03:22.402 --> 01:03:24.006
That's actually pretty cool.

937
01:03:27.341 --> 01:03:28.505
- Elijah!

938
01:04:08.349 --> 01:04:09.447
- Come with me.

939
01:04:29.337 --> 01:04:30.138
- What the hell?

940
01:04:30.173 --> 01:04:31.040
Why are we back here?

941
01:04:31.075 --> 01:04:31.667
- Shut the fuck up.

942
01:04:33.374 --> 01:04:34.043
- Who are you?

943
01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:36.606
- I was you once.

944
01:04:37.675 --> 01:04:39.279
A lamb.

945
01:04:39.314 --> 01:04:40.247
- You escaped?

946
01:04:40.282 --> 01:04:42.678
- No. no. no. no. Lyn let me go.

947
01:04:45.650 --> 01:04:46.715
- And why are you still here?

948
01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:48.090
- He won't let me leave.

949
01:04:52.327 --> 01:04:55.361
He makes me take the bodies
after they're done with them.

950
01:04:57.035 --> 01:04:58.694
I mark their passing.

951
01:05:00.731 --> 01:05:02.137
- How long have you been here?

952
01:05:02.172 --> 01:05:03.270
- Nine years. Nine years.

953
01:05:06.209 --> 01:05:07.076
- We have to stop them.

954
01:05:07.111 --> 01:05:07.571
- Yes. exactly.

955
01:05:09.542 --> 01:05:11.641
When Lyn let me go. she
let me go too early.

956
01:05:11.676 --> 01:05:14.479
They found someone else and
completed the sacrifice.

957
01:05:14.514 --> 01:05:15.986
Not this time.

958
01:05:16.021 --> 01:05:17.548
This time you wait.

959
01:05:17.583 --> 01:05:19.715
you stall them until
the last possible moment

960
01:05:21.158 --> 01:05:22.520
and then you shoot yourself.

961
01:05:23.721 --> 01:05:25.358
You send them to hell.

962
01:05:26.295 --> 01:05:27.657
- What?

963
01:05:27.692 --> 01:05:29.461
That's your plan?
For me to kill myself?

964
01:05:29.496 --> 01:05:31.133
- It's the only fucking way.

965
01:05:31.168 --> 01:05:32.497
- Just fucking. just. just.
just. get away from me man.

966
01:05:32.532 --> 01:05:33.630
- Elijah!?

967
01:05:33.665 --> 01:05:35.302
- Oh. fuck.

968
01:05:35.337 --> 01:05:37.337
- I'm gonna chop an
itty-bitty piece of you

969
01:05:37.372 --> 01:05:40.373
for every minute of my life
your wasting.

970
01:05:52.123 --> 01:05:53.089
- Oh shi...

971
01:07:28.813 --> 01:07:30.318
What?

972
01:07:30.353 --> 01:07:34.685
- Oh.
little lamb.

973
01:07:36.227 --> 01:07:37.193
I can't let you leave.

974
01:07:38.592 --> 01:07:39.789
Not like this.

975
01:07:41.364 --> 01:07:43.760
Not until you've heard
our offer.

976
01:07:45.401 --> 01:07:46.796
- Please.

977
01:07:46.831 --> 01:07:47.863
Please. don't do this.
- Shut the fuck up.

978
01:07:47.898 --> 01:07:48.564
- I give to you this
lamb of God.

979
01:07:48.599 --> 01:07:49.865
- Please. please. I have kids.

980
01:07:52.177 --> 01:07:53.341
Please don't do this.

981
01:07:53.376 --> 01:07:55.145
- Lyn!
- Just fucking do it.

982
01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:55.838
- Please.

983
01:07:56.775 --> 01:07:57.576
- What the fuck?

984
01:07:57.611 --> 01:07:59.215
- You let him go?

985
01:07:59.250 --> 01:08:00.414
Are you fucking kidding me?!

986
01:08:04.849 --> 01:08:08.587
- You can save Lyn from this
life of murder. Mr. Moulton.

987
01:08:08.622 --> 01:08:10.193
- Lyn's dead.

988
01:08:10.228 --> 01:08:12.195
- Not yet.
There's still time.

989
01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:15.858
- How?

990
01:08:17.565 --> 01:08:20.302
- Your soul.
Give him what he wants.

991
01:08:21.404 --> 01:08:21.864
Take her place.

992
01:08:23.241 --> 01:08:23.833
We need your soul.

993
01:08:31.612 --> 01:08:32.479
- Lyn?

994
01:08:42.689 --> 01:08:44.161
- I can't keep doing
this Frost.

995
01:08:46.264 --> 01:08:48.528
I can't keep killing people
every year.

996
01:08:48.563 --> 01:08:49.892
It's worse every year.

997
01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:56.338
- I'm afraid
you don't have a choice.

998
01:08:56.373 --> 01:08:59.638
It's the deal your
grandmother made.

999
01:08:59.673 --> 01:09:01.244
- There's gotta be
a way out.

1000
01:09:02.511 --> 01:09:05.413
- There is. Wagner.

1001
01:09:08.011 --> 01:09:09.615
- The man who tricked
the Devil?

1002
01:09:09.650 --> 01:09:10.748
That's real?

1003
01:09:10.783 --> 01:09:12.321
- Yes. it's real.

1004
01:09:12.356 --> 01:09:14.455
Wagner Moulton has a descendant.

1005
01:09:15.788 --> 01:09:18.789
A young man whose soul the
Devil would give anything for.

1006
01:09:19.891 --> 01:09:21.594
- Including our freedom?

1007
01:09:21.629 --> 01:09:22.496
- Yes.

1008
01:09:23.664 --> 01:09:26.929
You have to find him.
bring him here.

1009
01:09:26.964 --> 01:09:29.437
Convince him to make the deal.

1010
01:09:29.472 --> 01:09:30.438
- What's his name?

1011
01:09:30.473 --> 01:09:31.406
- You should know.

1012
01:09:32.409 --> 01:09:36.840
If we fail. our master
will not be forgiving.

1013
01:09:38.778 --> 01:09:41.977
- What is his name. Frost?

1014
01:09:53.595 --> 01:09:55.364
- Loves Lyn.
hero complex.

1015
01:09:58.930 --> 01:10:00.930
- Well. here we are again.

1016
01:10:05.871 --> 01:10:08.542
Oh. we can only die if we
don't renew the contract.

1017
01:10:08.577 --> 01:10:11.006
otherwise it just really hurts.

1018
01:10:13.714 --> 01:10:17.287
Frost used to be human. you
know. hundreds of years ago.

1019
01:10:17.322 --> 01:10:20.587
but he and a friend summoned
up the Devil

1020
01:10:20.622 --> 01:10:23.953
and that friend was Wagner.

1021
01:10:23.988 --> 01:10:26.021
who tricked the Devil.

1022
01:10:26.056 --> 01:10:29.530
Got those shiny boots of gold.
he got away with his soul.

1023
01:10:29.565 --> 01:10:32.434
And in punishment. Frost
has been trapped here

1024
01:10:32.469 --> 01:10:33.567
paying for it ever since.

1025
01:10:34.636 --> 01:10:37.538
You are the direct
descendant of Wagner Moulton.

1026
01:10:38.871 --> 01:10:40.002
eight generations removed.

1027
01:10:43.678 --> 01:10:46.415
- He's been after the soul
of Wagner Moulton descendants

1028
01:10:46.450 --> 01:10:47.647
ever since he was tricked.

1029
01:10:48.815 --> 01:10:51.013
He'd do anything for it.

1030
01:10:51.048 --> 01:10:54.720
including give me and
Miss Rose our souls back.

1031
01:10:54.755 --> 01:10:56.854
Sign the contract

1032
01:10:56.889 --> 01:11:00.363
and your beloved Lyn is
freed from this burden.

1033
01:11:00.398 --> 01:11:01.925
- You didn't bring me here
to kill me.

1034
01:11:03.797 --> 01:11:06.633
You brought me here to
trade my soul for yours.

1035
01:11:06.668 --> 01:11:07.865
- I'm so sorry. Elijah.

1036
01:11:08.967 --> 01:11:11.572
For two years. I worked you.

1037
01:11:11.607 --> 01:11:13.640
Two years to make sure that
you fell in love with me

1038
01:11:13.675 --> 01:11:14.806
and then I fell in
love with you.

1039
01:11:14.841 --> 01:11:16.478
How fucked up is that?

1040
01:11:19.582 --> 01:11:20.779
I just thought if you
saw what you could have-

1041
01:11:20.814 --> 01:11:21.945
- How could you do this to me?

1042
01:11:24.015 --> 01:11:26.455
- I didn't know what else to do.

1043
01:11:26.490 --> 01:11:28.721
I just thought there was
a way out of this for me.

1044
01:11:28.756 --> 01:11:32.626
But I realize now that this
is exactly what I deserve.

1045
01:11:32.661 --> 01:11:34.529
I'm so sorry. Elijah.

1046
01:11:34.564 --> 01:11:36.597
You have to get out of here.

1047
01:11:36.632 --> 01:11:37.298
You have to get out of here.

1048
01:11:37.333 --> 01:11:38.962
- You goddamn. motherfucking.

1049
01:11:38.997 --> 01:11:41.602
bitch-ass traitor motherfuckers.

1050
01:11:41.637 --> 01:11:42.801
We were a team!

1051
01:11:42.836 --> 01:11:44.968
- You didn't even think of
cutting us in.

1052
01:11:45.003 --> 01:11:46.904
- If he signs the contract
and you and Frost go free.

1053
01:11:46.939 --> 01:11:47.938
we don't have a lamb.

1054
01:11:47.973 --> 01:11:48.605
You're fucking killing us.

1055
01:11:48.641 --> 01:11:50.072
- I thought we were friends.

1056
01:11:51.713 --> 01:11:54.384
- Friends? This?

1057
01:11:55.453 --> 01:11:57.046
You're monsters.

1058
01:11:57.081 --> 01:11:58.454
You don't deserve to be free.

1059
01:11:58.489 --> 01:11:59.752
- That's it.

1060
01:11:59.787 --> 01:12:02.018
We're sacrificing this
motherfucker right now.

1061
01:12:02.053 --> 01:12:03.591
We can talk about our
relationships later. okay?

1062
01:12:03.626 --> 01:12:04.790
- Either one of you two
would've done

1063
01:12:04.825 --> 01:12:06.022
the same fucking thing.
- Hey!

1064
01:12:06.057 --> 01:12:06.858
- You shut the fuck up.

1065
01:12:06.893 --> 01:12:08.057
- I don't-
- Hey!

1066
01:12:12.734 --> 01:12:13.997
- You come any fucking closer

1067
01:12:15.704 --> 01:12:17.671
and I'm gonna fucking
shoot myself in the head.

1068
01:12:19.477 --> 01:12:20.575
- Just. wait.

1069
01:12:20.610 --> 01:12:21.939
- It's an hour until midnight.

1070
01:12:23.175 --> 01:12:26.779
Ain't no way you're finding
another sacrifice before then.

1071
01:12:26.814 --> 01:12:30.750
I die. you die.

1072
01:12:30.785 --> 01:12:31.520
- Elijah. come on.

1073
01:12:36.153 --> 01:12:38.087
- Relax.
- Okay. it's okay.

1074
01:12:40.861 --> 01:12:42.157
Okay. Okay.

1075
01:12:42.192 --> 01:12:43.026
- Easy.

1076
01:12:47.538 --> 01:12:49.032
Put it. put it down.

1077
01:13:02.179 --> 01:13:07.182
- Elijah! Get back here.

1078
01:13:21.572 --> 01:13:23.803
- I don't want this
anymore. Please.

1079
01:13:23.838 --> 01:13:25.805
Don't make me do this.

1080
01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:27.609
Just let me go.

1081
01:13:27.644 --> 01:13:29.237
- The way I see it.
Mr. Moulton.

1082
01:13:29.272 --> 01:13:31.239
you have two choices.

1083
01:13:31.274 --> 01:13:33.648
You can save the love
of your life

1084
01:13:33.683 --> 01:13:35.683
or you can run like a coward
- Shut up!

1085
01:13:35.718 --> 01:13:37.553
- And let an
innocent man die for you.

1086
01:13:37.588 --> 01:13:40.050
Take her place. Elijah.

1087
01:13:40.085 --> 01:13:42.085
You want to be a hero?

1088
01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:43.724
Here's your chance.

1089
01:13:43.759 --> 01:13:44.857
- Shut up! Shut up!

1090
01:13:44.892 --> 01:13:47.123
I don't care!
I don't fucking care!

1091
01:15:01.034 --> 01:15:02.572
- Shut the fuck up.

1092
01:15:02.607 --> 01:15:03.771
- Why is this taking so
fucking long?

1093
01:15:03.806 --> 01:15:05.069
You do this every fucking year.

1094
01:15:05.104 --> 01:15:05.905
- You wanna do this?

1095
01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:06.807
- Let them go.

1096
01:15:11.011 --> 01:15:12.340
- You remember.
we can't die right?

1097
01:15:12.375 --> 01:15:14.683
- You could die for a
little bit.

1098
01:15:14.718 --> 01:15:15.178
That's enough.

1099
01:15:16.951 --> 01:15:17.752
- Ow!

1100
01:15:17.787 --> 01:15:18.247
- Fuck

1101
01:15:19.690 --> 01:15:21.184
- What are you doing here?

1102
01:15:21.219 --> 01:15:22.251
- Untie him.

1103
01:15:22.286 --> 01:15:23.692
- What?

1104
01:15:23.727 --> 01:15:24.594
- Untie him.

1105
01:15:26.125 --> 01:15:27.630
- Are you fucking serious?

1106
01:15:27.665 --> 01:15:28.092
I just spent 30 minutes
doing that shit.

1107
01:15:28.127 --> 01:15:29.731
- Untie him!

1108
01:15:31.801 --> 01:15:33.262
- What the fuck?

1109
01:15:41.778 --> 01:15:44.614
- Okay. Now go home.

1110
01:15:44.649 --> 01:15:46.077
- No. I'm signing the contract.

1111
01:15:46.112 --> 01:15:47.177
- No.
- Yes.

1112
01:15:48.147 --> 01:15:49.751
I'm not losing you. Lyn.

1113
01:15:51.018 --> 01:15:53.249
If this is the only way we
can be together. then fine.

1114
01:15:54.351 --> 01:15:55.152
I love you.

1115
01:15:55.187 --> 01:15:56.219
- Elijah. please.

1116
01:15:56.254 --> 01:15:57.891
- You're not changing my mind.

1117
01:15:57.926 --> 01:16:01.356
- I hear we have a deal.

1118
01:16:05.362 --> 01:16:07.637
- You've made the right
choice. Mr. Moulton.

1119
01:16:22.819 --> 01:16:26.348
- Lyn. will you marry me
when this is all over?

1120
01:16:29.991 --> 01:16:30.858
- Yeah.

1121
01:16:33.797 --> 01:16:34.257
- Well damn.

1122
01:16:36.294 --> 01:16:38.767
I guess the therapy
worked after all.

1123
01:16:38.802 --> 01:16:41.297
- Your blood.
signed on the dotted line.

1124
01:16:46.172 --> 01:16:47.006
- And then you and her are free?

1125
01:16:47.041 --> 01:16:47.776
- Indeed.

1126
01:16:49.241 --> 01:16:50.405
- Just under the wire too. huh?

1127
01:16:51.749 --> 01:16:52.814
You've got minutes left.

1128
01:16:52.849 --> 01:16:54.684
- Yes. Swiftly please.

1129
01:16:54.719 --> 01:16:55.377
Proceed.

1130
01:16:59.284 --> 01:17:00.690
- I love you Elijah.

1131
01:17:01.924 --> 01:17:03.385
- More
than you'll ever know.

1132
01:17:05.862 --> 01:17:07.257
- What?

1133
01:17:07.292 --> 01:17:10.194
- And then Tara says. "You're
a fucking traitor Lyn."

1134
01:17:11.428 --> 01:17:12.094
- What. what are you? I don't-

1135
01:17:12.129 --> 01:17:14.198
- That's your line. isn't it?

1136
01:17:14.233 --> 01:17:15.463
"You're a fucking traitor Lyn."?

1137
01:17:15.498 --> 01:17:16.937
- I don't know what you-

1138
01:17:16.972 --> 01:17:21.172
- And then Joe says.
"She'll never love you.

1139
01:17:21.207 --> 01:17:23.075
You'll die alone."

1140
01:17:23.110 --> 01:17:24.472
- I. I don't understand-

1141
01:17:24.507 --> 01:17:26.210
- Stop. please. Stop.

1142
01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:30.313
Just stop.

1143
01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:35.054
You knew I would never
sell my soul

1144
01:17:35.089 --> 01:17:36.220
just because you asked me.

1145
01:17:38.059 --> 01:17:39.091
but I want to be a hero.

1146
01:17:39.929 --> 01:17:40.796
Right?

1147
01:17:42.096 --> 01:17:43.161
That's my weakness.

1148
01:17:44.868 --> 01:17:46.428
So you put on a little show.

1149
01:17:47.464 --> 01:17:51.169
Got me to think I'm saving
you from these monsters.

1150
01:17:52.205 --> 01:17:54.436
Sacrifice myself for you.

1151
01:17:54.471 --> 01:17:57.340
but I'm not just saving you.
am I Lyn?

1152
01:17:58.915 --> 01:18:02.114
I'm trading my soul for
all of you.

1153
01:18:04.085 --> 01:18:07.416
You've been working me
together this entire time!

1154
01:18:07.451 --> 01:18:08.989
- Dude. Just.
just please just...

1155
01:18:11.323 --> 01:18:14.357
- I found your little script
in Joe's car.

1156
01:18:18.803 --> 01:18:19.461
You lose.

1157
01:18:20.937 --> 01:18:21.397
You're done.

1158
01:18:22.906 --> 01:18:23.366
It's over.

1159
01:18:31.343 --> 01:18:32.815
Did you ever really
love me. Lyn?

1160
01:18:35.182 --> 01:18:36.214
Tell me the truth.

1161
01:18:47.128 --> 01:18:47.797
- Yes.

1162
01:18:53.497 --> 01:18:54.397
- Get him!

1163
01:18:54.432 --> 01:18:56.399
- Go!
- No!

1164
01:19:46.319 --> 01:19:48.286
- Your children.
your grandchildren.

1165
01:19:50.059 --> 01:19:51.487
It doesn't matter how
long it takes.

1166
01:19:53.326 --> 01:19:56.899
Elijah. we won't stop
until we have y-

1167
01:20:03.534 --> 01:20:06.942
No. no. please.

1168
01:20:19.253 --> 01:20:22.419
- This is
the last time you fail me.

1169
01:20:22.454 --> 01:20:23.453
Not like this.

1170
01:21:56.449 --> 01:21:57.514
- You're Tara's driver. right?

1171
01:21:57.549 --> 01:21:58.614
- Yes. sir.

1172
01:21:58.649 --> 01:22:00.088
Can you let her know I'm here?

1173
01:22:00.123 --> 01:22:01.683
- Hate to tell you this
man. but she's gone.

1174
01:22:02.752 --> 01:22:07.392
I think her exact words were.
"Fuck this therapy bullshit."

1175
01:22:07.427 --> 01:22:09.130
- Of course.

1176
01:22:09.165 --> 01:22:10.593
Thanks anyways.

1177
01:22:10.628 --> 01:22:11.660
- Mind giving me a lift?

1178
01:22:13.070 --> 01:22:13.728
My ride left too.

1179
01:22:27.612 --> 01:22:28.644
- So how was your stay?

1180
01:22:30.351 --> 01:22:35.189
- Pretty fucking rough.
but I learned a lot.

1181
01:22:41.296 --> 01:22:42.526
Wrote a whole new album too.

1182
01:22:47.797 --> 01:22:49.566

gonna hit.
