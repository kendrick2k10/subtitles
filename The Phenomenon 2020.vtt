There it was. a disc
going across the field
with two big swirls.

What I didn't see
was any exhaust. propulsion.

became public spokesman
for Project Blue Book.

59
00:05:09.723 --> 00:05:13.796

may have been
from somewhere else.

I thought. "Well. maybe something's wrong in my eyes."

79
00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:30.804
They seemed to flip and flash in the sun. just like a mirror.

I'd be glad to confirm it
with my hands on a Bible

to do with our army
or our intelligence.

with some foreign country.

00:13:23.388 --> 00:13:28.324
former Navy aviators
with thousands of hours
of flight experience.

168
00:13:28.359 --> 00:13:32.604
saw eight huge discs
fly in a stack formation

169
00:13:32.639 --> 00:13:34.986
over Chesapeake Bay. Virginia.

170
00:13:35.021 --> 00:13:39.163
just a stone's throw
from Washington. DC.

171
00:13:39.197 --> 00:13:42.028
When they came out
over the blackness of the bay.

172
00:13:42.062 --> 00:13:45.341
they were distinct
six red coins.

173
00:13:45.376 --> 00:13:48.689
When they got closer.
we could see that you're...

174
00:13:48.724 --> 00:13:53.384
It looked like
you were looking down
into it. like a hot coal.

175
00:13:53.418 --> 00:13:57.284
NARRATOR: They reported
the glowing red objects
had approached them head-on

176
00:13:57.319 --> 00:14:03.359
at a speed they estimated
at 6.000
to 12.000 miles per hour.

177
00:14:03.394 --> 00:14:06.742
It came in like this
and went out like this.

178
00:14:06.776 --> 00:14:12.852
There would be no way
of making a complete reversal
or a 90-degree turn

179
00:14:12.886 --> 00:14:15.716
12.000 miles an hour or greater

180
00:14:15.751 --> 00:14:19.410
without making the occupants
juice on the wall.

181
00:14:19.444 --> 00:14:23.310
That really shook us up.
Looking at the thing
shook us up.

182
00:14:23.345 --> 00:14:27.832
Nothing could have gotten
to that degree

183
00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:31.146
of scientific progress

184
00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:35.046
without some
of the intermediate stuff
having become public knowledge.

185
00:14:35.081 --> 00:14:39.326
You just knew
that they were not
from this planet.

186
00:14:43.952 --> 00:14:47.093
NARRATOR: The next weekend.
the unthinkable happened.

187
00:14:47.127 --> 00:14:51.787
The nation's capital
was invaded from the skies.

188
00:14:51.821 --> 00:14:57.931
Seven unknown blips
suddenly appeared on radar at Washington National Airport.

189
00:14:57.966 --> 00:15:02.487
Air-traffic controllers
at both Andrews
and Bolling Air Force bases

190
00:15:02.522 --> 00:15:07.216
confirmed the objects
as they danced
through restricted airspace.

191
00:15:11.876 --> 00:15:13.084
PITTMAN: The Capitol Building.

192
00:15:13.119 --> 00:15:15.017
The White House
where the president lived.

193
00:15:15.052 --> 00:15:18.296
these were some of
the most important places
in the country

194
00:15:18.331 --> 00:15:20.816
when it comes
to national defense.

195
00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:23.025
And there were UFOs
violating this airspace.

196
00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.408
and there was nothing thatthe Air Force could do about it.

197
00:15:26.442 --> 00:15:30.930
NARRATOR: F-94 interceptors
were scrambled.

198
00:15:30.964 --> 00:15:35.935
Pentagon press liaison Al Chop was in the radar room
that night.

199
00:15:35.969 --> 00:15:39.248
We could see the planes
coming in on this radar scope

200
00:15:39.283 --> 00:15:43.218
and the minute we saw
the beginning of these guys.

201
00:15:43.252 --> 00:15:46.290
the UFOs disappeared.
They just left.

202
00:15:46.324 --> 00:15:50.501
Obviously. whatever
these things were
had intelligence.

203
00:15:50.535 --> 00:15:54.608
enough to get out of the area
when we had an intercept
going in.

204
00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:00.476
NARRATOR: But the next weekend.
it began again.

205
00:16:00.511 --> 00:16:05.274
Pilot William Patterson
pushed his Starfire jet
to maximum speed

206
00:16:05.309 --> 00:16:08.519
to try to intercept
one of the glowing objects.

207
00:16:10.314 --> 00:16:13.420
Flew right into the middle
of three or four of them.

208
00:16:13.455 --> 00:16:17.700
NARRATOR: Al Chop recalls
the pilot's panicky
air-to-ground transmission

209
00:16:17.735 --> 00:16:24.052
as he streaked
at 600 miles per hour
into a group of unknowns.

210
00:16:24.086 --> 00:16:31.059
He actually said.
"They're closing in on me.
What do I do?"

211
00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:35.891
It was frightening.

212
00:16:35.925 --> 00:16:40.965
NARRATOR: The Air Force
had just issued orders
to shoot down the unknowns.

213
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.694
if "they can't talk them down."

214
00:16:45.728 --> 00:16:51.182
I'm not gonna tell
an Air Force pilot to fire
at the damn thing or anything.

215
00:16:51.217 --> 00:16:54.151
But I didn't say anything.
Nobody said anything.

216
00:16:55.566 --> 00:16:59.466
And then all of a sudden.
the things began
to move away from him

217
00:16:59.501 --> 00:17:01.158
and he said. "They're gone."

218
00:17:03.263 --> 00:17:05.093
I'm convinced
they're solid objects.

219
00:17:05.127 --> 00:17:09.166
I'm convinced that they're
probably from another planet.

220
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.340
or from outer space somewhere.

221
00:17:11.375 --> 00:17:14.412
I've always felt that way
since that night.

222
00:17:16.587 --> 00:17:19.659
NARRATOR: The very next day.
the Air Force's top brass

223
00:17:19.693 --> 00:17:25.044
hastily prepared the largest
Pentagon press conference
since World War II.

224
00:17:26.942 --> 00:17:31.360
Seen here
in a last-minute huddle.
Gen. Roger Ramey.

225
00:17:31.395 --> 00:17:34.708
Air Force director
of operations
at the Pentagon.

226
00:17:36.193 --> 00:17:39.299
Capt. Edward Ruppelt
of Project Blue Book.

227
00:17:39.334 --> 00:17:42.923
the Air Force's official
UFO investigations arm.

228
00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:47.825
and director
of Air Force intelligence.
Gen. John Samford.

229
00:17:47.859 --> 00:17:54.590
Since 1947. we have
received and analyzed
between one and 2.000 reports

230
00:17:54.625 --> 00:17:58.318
that have come to us
from all kinds of sources.

231
00:17:58.353 --> 00:18:01.528
Of this great mass of reports.
we have been able.

232
00:18:01.563 --> 00:18:05.084
adequately. to explain
the great bulk of them.

233
00:18:05.118 --> 00:18:10.399
However. there have been
a certain percentage
of this volume of reports

234
00:18:10.434 --> 00:18:17.268
that have been made
by credible observersof relatively incredible things.

235
00:18:17.303 --> 00:18:21.790
We can say
that the recent sightings
are in no way connected

236
00:18:21.824 --> 00:18:27.451
with any secret development
by any department
of the United States.

237
00:18:27.485 --> 00:18:32.525
NARRATOR: In the Q&A
with reporters. Samford
suggested a 50-50 chance

238
00:18:32.559 --> 00:18:37.495
it could have been radar waves bouncing off
temperature inversions.

239
00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:42.362
The point that Samford
put across all too effectively

240
00:18:42.397 --> 00:18:49.369
was that they were not real.
They were just
tricks of the atmosphere.

241
00:18:49.404 --> 00:18:53.718
And atmospheric phenomena
can't be a threat
to national security.

242
00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:57.205
You don't shoot at clouds.

243
00:19:00.449 --> 00:19:02.486
NARRATOR: The public was pondering the implications

244
00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.696
of possible
extraterrestrial contact.

245
00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:10.597
MAN: Robert L. Farnsworth. President of the United States Rocket Society.

246
00:19:10.632 --> 00:19:16.016
told defense officials
not to permit our planes to fire at any flying saucers.

247
00:19:16.051 --> 00:19:21.367
He says this might alienate humankind from beings of far superior forces.

248
00:19:21.401 --> 00:19:25.164
Farnsworth feels
that friendly contact
should be sought

249
00:19:25.198 --> 00:19:26.682
as long as possible.

250
00:19:29.375 --> 00:19:33.655
NARRATOR: Behind the scenes.
the CIA had other concerns.

251
00:19:34.863 --> 00:19:38.556
A secret internal memo
urged immediate attention

252
00:19:38.591 --> 00:19:41.525
to unexplained objects
in the vicinity

253
00:19:41.559 --> 00:19:45.184
of major
US Defense installations.

254
00:19:45.218 --> 00:19:48.048
I would dare say.
if anything happened

255
00:19:48.083 --> 00:19:51.397
we thought was a threat
to our national security.

256
00:19:51.431 --> 00:19:56.402
somebody out there.
one of the services.
would respond to it.

257
00:20:04.651 --> 00:20:07.861
Remember. this is
the height of the Cold War.

258
00:20:07.896 --> 00:20:12.763
Okay. there are bombers
on both sides
loaded with nuclear bombs.

259
00:20:12.797 --> 00:20:17.457
NARRATOR: Dr. Jacque Vallee
was the inspiration
for the French UFO researcher

260
00:20:17.492 --> 00:20:22.497
in Steven Spielberg's
Close Encounters
of the Third Kind.

261
00:20:22.531 --> 00:20:24.153
[SPEAKS FRENCH]

262
00:20:24.188 --> 00:20:26.570
Have you recently
had a close encounter?

263
00:20:26.604 --> 00:20:28.641
NARRATOR: In real life.
Dr. Vallee conducted

264
00:20:28.675 --> 00:20:31.437
sober scientific research
on the phenomenon.

265
00:20:31.471 --> 00:20:34.543
We know now that
there is no simple answer.

266
00:20:34.578 --> 00:20:37.097
NARRATOR: For decades.
he met with witnesses

267
00:20:37.132 --> 00:20:39.790
and traveled the globe
gathering evidence...

268
00:20:39.824 --> 00:20:45.140
ultimately creating
the first database
on the UFO subject.

269
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:48.074
Mr. Chairman.

270
00:20:48.108 --> 00:20:51.560
all the great nations
of the world are represented
on this committee.

271
00:20:51.595 --> 00:20:55.184
Let us keep in mind thatthe UFO phenomenon may represent

272
00:20:55.219 --> 00:20:57.256
an even greater reality.

273
00:20:57.290 --> 00:21:02.778
NARRATOR: Vallee also consulted
with scientific. military
and government officials.

274
00:21:02.813 --> 00:21:08.715
including Project Blue Book's
top science adviser.
Dr. J. Allen Hynek.

275
00:21:11.062 --> 00:21:16.585
I began my work
as scientific consultant
to the United States Air Force

276
00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:18.863
as an open skeptic.

277
00:21:18.898 --> 00:21:22.660
NARRATOR: Hynek was
a university astronomer with a high-security clearance

278
00:21:22.695 --> 00:21:27.838
when the Air Force
recruited him
to investigate UFOs.

279
00:21:27.872 --> 00:21:30.806
And it so happened
when the Air Force got the job
of trying to figure out

280
00:21:30.841 --> 00:21:33.982
what some of these strange
flying saucer stories
were about.

281
00:21:34.016 --> 00:21:37.123
well. they needed an astronomer
to see how many of the reports

282
00:21:37.157 --> 00:21:41.438
could possibly be explained
as meteors and twinkling stars
and planets.

283
00:21:41.472 --> 00:21:44.579
NARRATOR: The two scientists
became close colleagues.

284
00:21:44.613 --> 00:21:49.722
with Hynek entrusting Vallee
to index the reams
of Blue Book files

285
00:21:49.756 --> 00:21:52.380
scattered throughout
Hynek's home.

286
00:21:52.414 --> 00:21:58.075
It was there that Vallee
made a chance discovery
of a letter so secret.

287
00:21:58.109 --> 00:22:00.491
he had to appeal
to the chief counsel

288
00:22:00.526 --> 00:22:03.356
of the Senate Defense
Appropriations Committee

289
00:22:03.391 --> 00:22:05.531
to get it declassified.

290
00:22:05.565 --> 00:22:08.637
That document changed my life.
It taught me that

291
00:22:08.672 --> 00:22:14.333
the subject had been taken
much more seriously
than anybody thought.

292
00:22:14.367 --> 00:22:17.266
NARRATOR: The document revealed
an ultra-secret.

293
00:22:17.301 --> 00:22:20.304
highly funded
scientific investigation

294
00:22:20.339 --> 00:22:23.031
working parallel to Blue Book

295
00:22:23.065 --> 00:22:26.655
unknown to all
but a select few.

296
00:22:29.209 --> 00:22:32.178
The letter was signed
by H.C. Cross.

297
00:22:32.212 --> 00:22:37.494
director of exotic metallurgy
at Battelle
National Laboratories.

298
00:22:37.528 --> 00:22:40.980
VALLEE: These were the people
who had analyzed the facts

299
00:22:41.014 --> 00:22:46.365
with a large budget.with highly competent physicistsand computer scientists.

300
00:22:51.749 --> 00:22:56.547
Who are these people?
What information did they have?

301
00:22:56.582 --> 00:22:59.378
Good evening.
Tonight. we go after
a fantastic story.

302
00:22:59.412 --> 00:23:04.210
The story that flying saucers
from other worlds
are visiting our planet.

303
00:23:04.244 --> 00:23:08.801
just as we are exploring
outer space
with our own rocket satellites.

304
00:23:08.835 --> 00:23:12.529
Our guest is
former Marine Air Corps
Maj. Donald Keyhoe.

305
00:23:12.563 --> 00:23:16.395
in his campaign to prove
that flying saucers exist.

306
00:23:16.429 --> 00:23:20.537
My name is Mike Wallace.
The cigarette is Parliament.

307
00:23:20.571 --> 00:23:24.368
Why would the United States
government withhold information

308
00:23:24.403 --> 00:23:26.266
from United States citizens?
For what reason?

309
00:23:26.301 --> 00:23:29.442
The Air Force is simply
treating the American people
like children.

310
00:23:29.477 --> 00:23:31.410
They don't trust them
with the facts.

311
00:23:36.415 --> 00:23:40.177
NARRATOR:
During the '50s and '60s.
it wasn't just the Americans

312
00:23:40.211 --> 00:23:42.213
who were seeing flying saucers.

313
00:23:42.248 --> 00:23:44.526
At the Westall School
in Australia.

314
00:23:44.561 --> 00:23:49.945
several hundred students
saw an object hovering over
this power line tower

315
00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:51.809
on their athletic field.

316
00:23:51.844 --> 00:23:55.917
An event they vividly recall
50 years later.

317
00:23:55.951 --> 00:23:58.022
A student came
into the classroom. you know.

318
00:23:58.057 --> 00:24:01.198
"There's flying saucers
in the oval.
there's flying saucers."

319
00:24:01.232 --> 00:24:03.303
and everybody ran out.

320
00:24:03.338 --> 00:24:06.859
And I remember the fear
and the hysteria
of all the students.

321
00:24:06.893 --> 00:24:11.346
I couldn't believe it
because what I was seeing
wasn't possible.

322
00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:16.351
It was vertical. horizontal.
It'd move away from us.
back towards us.

323
00:24:16.385 --> 00:24:18.733
Appear somewhere else.
somewhere else.

324
00:24:18.767 --> 00:24:22.840
My God. you know?
But it was exciting.

325
00:24:22.875 --> 00:24:26.672
It was like that
and then all of a sudden.
it just turned on its side

326
00:24:26.706 --> 00:24:30.503
and I could see
that it was a round disc.

327
00:24:30.538 --> 00:24:34.887
NARRATOR: The children
saw the disc begin to descend
into this wooded reserve

328
00:24:34.921 --> 00:24:37.821
at the end of the school's
running path.

329
00:24:37.855 --> 00:24:40.858
I ran towards the corner
of the school.
jumped the fence

330
00:24:40.893 --> 00:24:44.413
and ran towards where it looked
as though it went down
into the trees.

331
00:24:44.448 --> 00:24:48.487
and then stopped dead
because it was right in front
of me on the ground.

332
00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:52.732
Like a disc with a slight rise
in the middle.

333
00:24:52.767 --> 00:24:55.701
I also heard a low.
sort of a humming noise.

334
00:24:55.735 --> 00:24:58.427
and I felt a bit of a heat
coming off it as well.

335
00:25:04.813 --> 00:25:07.747
And it started to take off
pretty well straight away.

336
00:25:07.782 --> 00:25:11.130
It had all bluey-purple lights
around the bottom.

337
00:25:11.164 --> 00:25:12.959
Don't remember seeing
any windows.

338
00:25:12.994 --> 00:25:15.928
and it took off to about
probably four or five meters
in the air.

339
00:25:15.962 --> 00:25:21.278
and then turned on its side.
and just went... [VOCALIZES]
Straight up so fast.

even nowadays.
that could go that fast.

341
00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.907
NARRATOR: Shortly after
the object departed.

342
00:25:29.942 --> 00:25:33.048
the authorities converged
on the school.

343
00:25:33.083 --> 00:25:38.675
We had Army. Air Force. policedown here cordoning off the area

344
00:25:38.709 --> 00:25:42.679
to prevent any of us enteringthe area or disturbing anything.

345
00:25:42.713 --> 00:25:45.509
We got called to assembly.
The headmaster said.

346
00:25:45.544 --> 00:25:49.030
"You have not seen this.
You do not talk about it.

347
00:25:49.064 --> 00:25:50.583
You'll be in trouble if you do."

348
00:25:51.757 --> 00:25:53.552
NARRATOR:
For the first time ever.

349
00:25:53.586 --> 00:25:58.867
the school science teacher
agreed to describe
what he saw that day.

350
00:25:58.902 --> 00:26:01.870
providing we concealed
his identity.

351
00:26:01.905 --> 00:26:05.702
It was not a mirage.
There was something physical
in the sky.

352
00:26:05.736 --> 00:26:09.119
It was silver. It could hover.

353
00:26:09.153 --> 00:26:12.225
It could move slowly.
It could move very rapidly.

354
00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:16.402
Eventually it moved away
to the other side of the oval.

355
00:26:16.436 --> 00:26:18.473
and down behind some pine trees.

00:26:18.507 --> 00:26:21.683

What he said next sheds light
on why the school staff

360

have remained silent
all these years.

361
00:26:36.802 --> 00:26:39.287
There was a knock on the door
one night.

362
00:26:39.321 --> 00:26:42.048
Two older men. one in uniform.

363
00:26:42.083 --> 00:26:44.775
asked for my description
of what I had seen.

364
00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:48.020
I was then told
that I hadn't seen anything.

365
00:26:48.054 --> 00:26:51.540
that I'd made it all up.
possibly because I was drunk

366
00:26:51.575 --> 00:26:55.130
and that they would
have to report that fact
to the Education Department

367
00:26:55.165 --> 00:26:59.203
and I would lose my job.
After that. I was told

368
00:26:59.238 --> 00:27:02.931
that I would be prosecuted underthe Official Secrets Act.

369
00:27:02.966 --> 00:27:08.350
and I was told that there wasn'tanything there.
when I knew there was.

370
00:27:08.385 --> 00:27:11.112
and that I had to keep quiet
about it.

371
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:16.704
Why did I have to keep quiet?

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:22.330
NARRATOR: The Westall landing
may not have been
an isolated incident.

Four days prior.
a then-young engineer
in nearby Balwyn

374
00:27:27.128 --> 00:27:31.546
was taking photos
in his mother's garden when something caught his eye.

375
00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:37.310
This tremendous flash of light.
and I looked up.
and I saw this object...

376
00:27:37.345 --> 00:27:41.142
I had a Polaroid camera.
I pulled this up
and hit myself on the face.

377
00:27:41.176 --> 00:27:45.111
And I took the picture.
I've got the photograph here.

378
00:27:45.146 --> 00:27:46.906
This is the original Polaroid?

379
00:27:46.941 --> 00:27:48.943
That's it.

380
00:27:56.985 --> 00:27:59.678
Looked like it was made
out of some form of metal.

381
00:27:59.712 --> 00:28:00.920
and it was engineered.

382
00:28:00.955 --> 00:28:04.821
And being an engineer.
I was sure it was.

383
00:28:06.132 --> 00:28:07.824
And this is
when I took the photograph.

384
00:28:07.858 --> 00:28:10.067
and it had tipped around
and I could see the bottom.

385
00:28:10.102 --> 00:28:12.173
and it looked like
it was rotating to me.

386
00:28:13.933 --> 00:28:17.626
That was it.
and then after that.
it sort of gave a bounce

387
00:28:17.661 --> 00:28:21.078
and it rocketed away
to the north. very high speed.

388
00:28:21.113 --> 00:28:23.425
INTERVIEWER: Can you describe
the acceleration?

389
00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:27.119
It was almost instantaneous.
It's like
it had been shot out of a gun.

390
00:28:27.706 --> 00:28:30.329
Wham. you know?

391
00:28:30.363 --> 00:28:33.504
NARRATOR: Air Force officers

of his experience.

393
00:28:36.645 --> 00:28:41.616
And they also had some
photographs of similar things.

394
00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:47.139
and they also had a book
which had pictures
of things in which...

395
00:28:47.173 --> 00:28:50.245
They didn't leave it with me.
but I had a look through.

396
00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:56.113
But they said it was
an unidentified flying object.

397
00:28:57.218 --> 00:28:58.944
That was it.

MAN: Several reports of a strange egg-shaped object about 200 feet long

405
00:29:26.488 --> 00:29:31.977
landing on farms and highways
last night
in the vicinity of Levelland.

406
00:29:32.011 --> 00:29:35.635
Sheriff Clem says
he even himself
got a glimpse of the thing.

407
00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:40.123
which somehow turned off
lights and auto engines
when it came near.

408
00:29:48.269 --> 00:29:52.721
Within 24 to 36 hours
after these sightings

415
00:30:14.122 --> 00:30:17.988

00:30:18.023 --> 00:30:21.371
of some controlled object
from outer space.

that one of the two persons
turned his head

MAN: When I got out of the car.
about 50 feet from it...

424
00:31:49.666 --> 00:31:54.119
I guess they saw me
because they started their motor or whatever it is.

425
00:31:54.153 --> 00:31:57.881
I could see a big blast of fire
coming from right under it.

426
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:03.473
So. I was behind
some bushes there.
behind my car.

427
00:32:03.507 --> 00:32:05.889
I could see it
and I could feel that heat.

428
00:32:07.718 --> 00:32:10.721
That really got me scared.
you know?

429
00:32:10.756 --> 00:32:14.035
A lot of people say.
"Why didn't you take your gun out and shoot at it?"

430
00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:16.900
They weren't doing
nothing to me.

431
00:32:18.074 --> 00:32:21.353
It just took a little while
to get airborne.

432
00:32:21.387 --> 00:32:25.944
came up a little bit.
about 20-30 feet.
and it stayed there a while.

433
00:32:31.294 --> 00:32:34.124
And it was just as quiet
as it could be.

434
00:32:36.678 --> 00:32:39.958
And then just flew away.
that's it.

435
00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:51.141
Lonnie was very. very scared.
He was as white as a sheet.

among the first to arrive at
the landing and takeoff site.

in some of the weeds
that were around it.

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:02.021
WOMAN: August 17. 1960.
our Red Bluff officers

488
00:36:02.056 --> 00:36:04.231
and dozens of people
saw a saucer.

489
00:36:04.265 --> 00:36:10.306
KID 4: Can you tell me
how long it stayed on Earth.
and other things like that?

490
00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:12.549
MARY: Then people started
making fun of him

491
00:36:12.584 --> 00:36:16.001
that he had seen little men
from outer space

492
00:36:16.035 --> 00:36:21.248
or this and that.
A whole bunch of dirty stuff.

493
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:27.046
MAN: Lot of people asked me.
"Is that the reason
you quit the police force?"

494
00:36:27.081 --> 00:36:28.841
No. the reason
I quit the police force

495
00:36:28.876 --> 00:36:32.190
was because I was going
and doing a lot
of publicity and stuff.

496
00:36:32.224 --> 00:36:34.640
I didn't wanna hurt the town.

497
00:36:37.367 --> 00:36:42.924
NARRATOR: The level of inquiry
went all the way to the office of the President.

498
00:36:42.959 --> 00:36:48.689
To this day.
the Socorro close encounter
remains unexplained.

499
00:36:50.277 --> 00:36:52.348
VALLEE:
Socorro was very similar

500
00:36:52.382 --> 00:36:57.698
to the French cases
that I had brought
to Hynek's attention.

501
00:36:57.732 --> 00:37:02.772
Checked by the police.checked by the French Air Force.

502
00:37:02.806 --> 00:37:06.224
where there were also occupants
who were seen.

503
00:37:06.258 --> 00:37:10.711
short beings.
in connection with the objects.

504
00:37:13.023 --> 00:37:15.233
I think that's what
convinced him

505
00:37:15.267 --> 00:37:19.582
that there were UFO landings
in the United States.

506
00:37:29.177 --> 00:37:33.458
Looked like a toy top
somewhat upside down.

507
00:37:33.492 --> 00:37:36.978
So this is the diagram
which we've come up with.

508
00:37:37.013 --> 00:37:39.567
It's more flat here
other than round.

509
00:37:39.602 --> 00:37:41.742
But it does have the hump
up in here.

510
00:37:41.776 --> 00:37:44.745
It seemed to move off the groundif it was down.

511
00:37:44.779 --> 00:37:48.162
And then we saw three lights
that went from yellow to red.

512
00:37:48.196 --> 00:37:50.613
When you got right up to it.
it lit up.

513
00:37:50.647 --> 00:37:53.201
I mean. it really did
become bright.
and we could see it.

514
00:37:53.236 --> 00:37:56.204
the outline of it. real good.

515
00:37:56.239 --> 00:37:59.449
NARRATOR: Blue Book's
Dr. Allen Hynek investigated

516
00:37:59.484 --> 00:38:01.348
one of the alleged
landing sites

517
00:38:01.382 --> 00:38:04.212
with the local sheriff.

518
00:38:04.247 --> 00:38:07.733
At an overflow press conference later that day.

519
00:38:07.768 --> 00:38:11.772
the world held its breath
for an historic revelation

520
00:38:11.806 --> 00:38:14.499
about the landings in Michigan.

521
00:38:14.533 --> 00:38:19.469
Hynek. by now
privately convinced
of the UFO reality.

522
00:38:19.504 --> 00:38:22.369
struggled to follow
the Air Force policy

523
00:38:22.403 --> 00:38:25.337
of tamping down
public excitement.

524
00:38:25.993 --> 00:38:27.788
[MAN SPEAKING]

525
00:38:31.757 --> 00:38:37.591
I'm saying that the two cases
that I investigated
most deeply were most likely.

526
00:38:37.625 --> 00:38:41.698
I said in a statement
that I couldn't prove it
in a court of law.

527
00:38:41.733 --> 00:38:43.493
[MAN SPEAKING]

528
00:38:44.943 --> 00:38:46.324
No. that's not quite right.

529
00:38:46.358 --> 00:38:49.603
I think that a person can be
pretty sure about something

530
00:38:49.637 --> 00:38:52.433
without being ableto convict somebody of a murder.

531
00:38:52.468 --> 00:38:58.266
-Can you? Please.
-Yes. I do. Honestly.
in this case.

532
00:38:58.301 --> 00:38:59.923
[MAN SPEAKING]

533
00:39:01.131 --> 00:39:03.686
NARRATOR:
Hynek's strained explanation.

534
00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:06.861
which he later called
his greatest regret.

535
00:39:06.896 --> 00:39:09.381
ignited a public furor.

536
00:39:09.416 --> 00:39:11.521
MAN: Mr. Ford.
what about flying saucers?

537
00:39:11.556 --> 00:39:14.248
You've had some in Michigan
in the past week.

538
00:39:14.282 --> 00:39:20.703
GERALD: Dave. we've had
several incidents that many felt were sufficient

539
00:39:20.737 --> 00:39:24.085
to justify some action
by our government.

540
00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:28.849
and not the kind of
flippant answer that was given by the Air Force

541
00:39:28.883 --> 00:39:33.336
where they passed it off
as "swamp gas."

542
00:39:33.371 --> 00:39:38.168
It seems to me that this mystery does require

543
00:39:38.203 --> 00:39:40.550
that the Congress
take a good look at it.

544
00:39:40.585 --> 00:39:44.347
Let them put their record
on the line.

545
00:39:44.382 --> 00:39:50.595
NARRATOR: On April 5th. 1966.
congressional hearings
were held with Dr. Hynek

546
00:39:50.629 --> 00:39:55.772
and Secretary of the Air Force Harold Brown
both giving testimony.

547
00:39:58.119 --> 00:40:03.849
MAN 1: Mr. Ford has come out.
He has a pretty good-size
stature in the Congress.

548
00:40:03.884 --> 00:40:06.645
And so. Mr. Secretary.

549
00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:12.755
see if you can shed some light on these
highly illuminated objects.

550
00:40:12.789 --> 00:40:14.895
MAN 2: Mr. Secretary.
there have been charges

551
00:40:14.929 --> 00:40:18.277
that the Air Force
is hiding something
in the UFO field.

552
00:40:18.312 --> 00:40:21.349
We have not been
hiding anything.

553
00:40:21.384 --> 00:40:24.560
The investigations
have been made public.

554
00:40:24.594 --> 00:40:27.563
The hearing this morningwas public for just that reason.

555
00:40:27.597 --> 00:40:29.772
There has never been
any evidence

556
00:40:29.806 --> 00:40:32.637
presented to
the United States Air Force.

557
00:40:32.671 --> 00:40:35.294
or discovered by
the United States Air Force.

558
00:40:35.329 --> 00:40:38.125
which would indicate
that the UFO phenomena

559
00:40:38.159 --> 00:40:42.819
represents any interplanetary
space vehicle of any kind.

560
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:48.135
NARRATOR:
Amid growing pressure.
the Air Force commissioned

561
00:40:48.169 --> 00:40:50.206
an outside panel of scientists

562
00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:55.936
to analyze select cases
and settle the matter
once and for all.

563
00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:59.077
It was headed
by physicist Edward Condon.

564
00:40:59.111 --> 00:41:04.323
Dr. Condon. do you hope
to find people from
outer space here on Earth?

565
00:41:04.358 --> 00:41:08.155
Well. I don't know for sure.
but we'll try to
just study the reports

566
00:41:08.189 --> 00:41:11.883
and get as much
additional information
as we can to see.

567
00:41:11.917 --> 00:41:16.888
REPORTER: Would you like
to have us being visited
by these little or big things?

568
00:41:16.922 --> 00:41:20.408
Well. that'd be fine with me.
I hope they're friendly.

569
00:41:20.443 --> 00:41:22.169
How do you propose
to go about...

570
00:41:22.203 --> 00:41:25.690
NARRATOR: After the project
was launched. Condon remarked to an audience

571
00:41:25.724 --> 00:41:29.176
that he thought
the UFO subject was nonsense.

572
00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:35.803
But "I'm not supposed to reach that conclusion
for another year."

573
00:41:38.116 --> 00:41:40.118
After a two-year investigation.

574
00:41:40.152 --> 00:41:44.571
the panel submitted
a massive 1.400 page report

575
00:41:44.605 --> 00:41:48.816
showing that many cases
were radar
and weather anomalies.

576
00:41:48.851 --> 00:41:53.372
but confirming a number
as truly unexplainable.

577
00:41:53.407 --> 00:41:56.341
Among them were
the famous McMinnville photos

578
00:41:56.375 --> 00:41:59.517
taken on the Trent family farm.

579
00:41:59.551 --> 00:42:04.004
as well as film footage of UFOs in Great Falls. Montana.

580
00:42:05.730 --> 00:42:08.249
NICK: As I looked up.
I saw two silvery objects

581
00:42:08.284 --> 00:42:10.079
moving swiftly
out of the northwest.

582
00:42:10.113 --> 00:42:14.566
No sound. except I thought
I heard a whooshing sound
when I first saw them.

583
00:42:14.601 --> 00:42:17.051
The discs appeared
to be spinning like a top.

584
00:42:17.086 --> 00:42:18.777
and were about 50 feet across.

585
00:42:18.812 --> 00:42:20.607
which was much slower
than the jets

586
00:42:20.641 --> 00:42:23.679
which shot by shortly
after I filmed the discs.

587
00:42:23.713 --> 00:42:27.924
I could not see any exhaust. wings or any kind of fuselage.

588
00:42:27.959 --> 00:42:31.963
They appeared to be
of a bright. shiny metal.
like polished silver.

589
00:42:35.035 --> 00:42:40.454
There are cases
that are not explainable
in conventional terms.

590
00:42:40.488 --> 00:42:45.148
There is the assumption
of intelligence
or intelligent control.

591
00:42:45.183 --> 00:42:49.946
but not necessarily
the assumption
of direct communication.

592
00:42:49.981 --> 00:42:53.501
Why are they here?
What are they doing?

593
00:42:53.536 --> 00:42:56.608
What do they want from us?
What are their motivations?

594
00:42:57.989 --> 00:43:01.579
NARRATOR: But it was Dr. Condon
who wrote the final word.

595
00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:03.995
[READING]

596
00:43:14.212 --> 00:43:19.907
I was kind of woolly
on that one.
You'd have to conclude

597
00:43:19.942 --> 00:43:25.706
that what we were looking at
was beyond our current state
of the knowledge.

598
00:43:25.741 --> 00:43:29.296
But it began to hit me
that Dr. Condon
has apparently not read

599
00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:31.298
his own material very carefully.

600
00:43:31.332 --> 00:43:33.887
You do an actual tabulation.
which he doesn't seem
to have done.

601
00:43:33.921 --> 00:43:36.648
and you find his percentage ofunexplained is five to six times

602
00:43:36.683 --> 00:43:37.925
larger than the Air Force.

603
00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:40.031
And yet. what is his
principal recommendation?

604
00:43:40.065 --> 00:43:42.965
The principal recommendation
that Dr. Condon
has come through with

605
00:43:42.999 --> 00:43:46.002
is there's nothing
of scientific interest
that warrants further attention

606
00:43:46.037 --> 00:43:48.626
on the part
of the federal government
here in any major way.

607
00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:51.421
He recommends
dropping the whole problem.

608
00:43:51.456 --> 00:43:56.668
Nobody could get funded.
Nobody would look
at the data seriously

609
00:43:56.703 --> 00:44:00.672
because of the prestige
of the academy

610
00:44:00.707 --> 00:44:02.881
saying that the problem
had been solved.

611
00:44:02.916 --> 00:44:06.678
The Air Force closed
their reporting system.

612
00:44:06.713 --> 00:44:09.992
so that if the public
wanted to report something.

613
00:44:10.026 --> 00:44:12.373
they would report it
to the local police.

614
00:44:12.408 --> 00:44:14.755
But it would never get
to the attention

615
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:18.897
of scientists really examining
the phenomena.

616
00:44:20.554 --> 00:44:26.905
NARRATOR: In 1969. the Air Force officially ended its public investigations.

617
00:44:29.459 --> 00:44:32.083
Which would suggest what?

618
00:44:32.117 --> 00:44:33.809
That they knew what it was?

619
00:44:35.431 --> 00:44:36.950
Or didn't know what it was.

620
00:44:38.054 --> 00:44:41.713
Also the other way.
And they did know what it was.

621
00:45:05.392 --> 00:45:08.809
NARRATOR: One aspect
of the phenomenon
that was swept under the rug

622
00:45:08.844 --> 00:45:12.744
was the pervasive reporting
of UFO intrusions

623
00:45:12.779 --> 00:45:17.093
at the world's most sensitive military facilities.

624
00:45:17.128 --> 00:45:20.752
Details did not come to light
until decades later

625
00:45:20.787 --> 00:45:24.618
at the National Press Club
in Washington. DC.

626
00:45:25.861 --> 00:45:30.520
Declassified US government
documents and witness testimony

627
00:45:30.555 --> 00:45:33.869
from former or retired
US military personnel

628
00:45:33.903 --> 00:45:40.116
confirmed. beyond any doubt.
the reality
of ongoing UFO incursions

629
00:45:40.151 --> 00:45:41.980
at nuclear weapon sites.

630
00:45:42.015 --> 00:45:45.501
What you have heard here today
is evidence of a phenomenon.

631
00:45:45.535 --> 00:45:48.607
It sounds fantastic.
and it is fantastic.

632
00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:53.198
In 1967.
I was a missile launch officer

633
00:45:53.233 --> 00:45:55.787
stationed at Malmstrom
Air Force Base. Montana.

634
00:45:55.822 --> 00:46:00.792
NARRATOR: Malmstrom was
America's first line
of nuclear defense.

635
00:46:00.827 --> 00:46:03.622
its silos packed
with Minutemen missiles.

636
00:46:03.657 --> 00:46:09.974
Each one nearly 100 times
more powerful than the bomb
that devastated Hiroshima.

637
00:46:11.182 --> 00:46:15.220
Launch officers could. within minutes of confirmation.

638
00:46:15.255 --> 00:46:22.227
send their birds arcing
6.000 miles to incinerate
key Soviet cities.

639
00:46:22.262 --> 00:46:25.783
triggering a war
that would end
our civilization.

640
00:46:39.866 --> 00:46:42.420
I was the chief of party.
I was the observer.

641
00:46:42.454 --> 00:46:47.183
Basically what I was doing
was the star observation
to provide precise

642
00:46:47.218 --> 00:46:51.636
latitude and longitude
on our small three-man team.

643
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:55.398
Came from the north
and stopped right over us.

644
00:46:55.433 --> 00:47:01.094
and it had a white light
from the center.
looking down into this island.

645
00:47:01.128 --> 00:47:04.200
I just said to myself.
"What if this thing beams us up

646
00:47:04.235 --> 00:47:06.616
and takes us off
to some distant place

647
00:47:06.651 --> 00:47:08.308
and never returned
to Earth again?"

648
00:47:08.342 --> 00:47:11.863
I mean. this is going through
my head here
while this thing's above me.

649
00:47:11.898 --> 00:47:15.902
And then from this dead stop.

was stationed

653
00:47:39.201 --> 00:47:41.893
in his underground
launch control capsule

654
00:47:41.928 --> 00:47:46.587
when he received a frantic call from one of his topside guards.

at a red glowing object

657
00:47:51.661 --> 00:47:54.216
hovering just above
our front gate.

658
00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:59.911
Our missiles began going intowhat's called a no-go condition.or unlaunchable.

659
00:47:59.946 --> 00:48:01.326
Essentially. they were disabled.

660
00:48:03.846 --> 00:48:09.507
NARRATOR: In fact. ten missiles
began going offline
in a matter of seconds.

661
00:48:09.541 --> 00:48:11.474
one after the other.

662
00:48:14.719 --> 00:48:18.136
Personally. I'm never aware
of two missiles going down
at the same time.

663
00:48:18.171 --> 00:48:19.241
let alone ten.

664
00:48:19.275 --> 00:48:20.967
I was a top-secret
control officer

665
00:48:21.001 --> 00:48:24.177
and I passed down
nuclear launch authenticators.

666
00:48:24.211 --> 00:48:28.353
I can clearly recall a message
coming through my
communications center

667
00:48:28.388 --> 00:48:31.909
which basically said
that a UFO did. in fact.

668
00:48:31.943 --> 00:48:35.809

in Montana.

669

MAN: I was on duty at Echo.
which is our
squadron command post.

670
00:48:44.645 --> 00:48:48.477
We had strike teams respond
to alarms from the missiles.

671
00:48:48.511 --> 00:48:50.168
They were
three to five miles away.

672
00:48:50.203 --> 00:48:53.137
And they said.
"Sir. for lack
of a better description.

673
00:48:53.171 --> 00:48:55.415
there's a flying saucer
hovering over that missile.

674
00:48:55.449 --> 00:48:58.970
and there's a beam
of reddish light
going down to it."

675
00:49:00.006 --> 00:49:01.421
It had to be
a data collection thing.

676
00:49:01.455 --> 00:49:04.217
I'm sure they scanned
the warhead or something.

677
00:49:08.738 --> 00:49:12.950
In 1980. I was reassigned from
the Pentagon to RAF Bentwater

678
00:49:12.984 --> 00:49:14.330
as a deputy base commander.

679
00:49:14.365 --> 00:49:16.160
At that time. Bentwaters
was one of the largest

680
00:49:16.194 --> 00:49:18.610

in the world.

681

00:49:24.754 --> 00:49:27.585
In December 1980.
early in the morning.

684
00:49:27.619 --> 00:49:29.069
several of our
security policemen

685
00:49:29.104 --> 00:49:31.175
discovered strange lights
in the forest.

NARRATOR: Expecting to find
a crashed aircraft.

687
00:49:33.591 --> 00:49:39.666
they came upon
an unrecognizable object
resting on the forest floor.

688
00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:45.465
They observed it for a period
of time. and it very quickly
and silently vanished.

689
00:49:49.917 --> 00:49:52.230
NARRATOR: Two nights later.
Col. Halt received

690
00:49:52.265 --> 00:49:56.338
an urgent visit from
the base security commander.

691
00:49:56.372 --> 00:49:59.858
He was white as a sheet.
He said. "It's back."

692
00:49:59.893 --> 00:50:02.482
I said. "What's back?"
He said. "The UFO."

693
00:50:04.139 --> 00:50:06.417
I took several
security policemen with me.

694
00:50:06.451 --> 00:50:10.938
I also had my small
cassette recorder I carried
everywhere when I was on duty.

00:50:10.973 --> 00:50:13.838
-MAN: What is it?
-COL. HALT: We don't know. sir.

696
00:50:13.872 --> 00:50:16.358
Yeah. it's a strange.
small red light.

697
00:50:16.392 --> 00:50:19.464
HALT: And all the barnyard animals have gotten quiet now.

698
00:50:19.499 --> 00:50:20.465
Deathly calm.

699
00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:22.398
This is weird.

700
00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:27.162
One object approached us
at very high speed.

MAN: Here he comes
from the side.
He's coming toward us now.

702
00:50:29.681 --> 00:50:33.478
I'm observing what a beam
coming down to the ground.

703
00:50:34.721 --> 00:50:36.585
This is unreal.

704
00:50:36.619 --> 00:50:37.758
We stood there in awe.

705
00:50:37.793 --> 00:50:39.933
Was this a warning?

706
00:50:39.967 --> 00:50:41.762
Was this an attempt
to communicate?

707
00:50:41.797 --> 00:50:45.352
Was this a weapon.
or just a probe?

708
00:50:45.387 --> 00:50:49.667
Just as suddenly as it appeared.click. disappeared.

709
00:50:49.701 --> 00:50:51.496
We stood there... Oh.

710
00:50:52.532 --> 00:50:54.361
About that time.
we noticed the other object

711
00:50:54.396 --> 00:50:56.570
to the south was
sending down beams.

712
00:50:56.605 --> 00:50:59.263
About a mile. mile and half awayover at Woodbridge Base.

713
00:50:59.297 --> 00:51:01.334
MAN 1: when we had great
difficulties communicating.

714
00:51:01.368 --> 00:51:04.026
But we were able to discern
that some of those beams
were either

715
00:51:04.061 --> 00:51:06.304
falling into or near
the weapons storage area.

716
00:51:06.339 --> 00:51:08.789
and there was a great
deal of concern.

717
00:51:08.824 --> 00:51:12.931
MAN 1: I also found out later
that both the tower operators
at Bentwaters

718
00:51:12.966 --> 00:51:17.557
saw an object and picked it up on their bright radar
and watched it.

719
00:51:17.591 --> 00:51:20.077
I was just sitting there
and I happened to see

720
00:51:20.111 --> 00:51:22.527
a dot come on the scope.

721
00:51:22.562 --> 00:51:25.565
and it just went like.
one dot at the beginning.

722
00:51:25.599 --> 00:51:28.015
then another dot.
then another dot.
and it was gone.

723
00:51:28.050 --> 00:51:32.537
A nd then it made an immediate
right-hand turn and came
right towards the base.

724
00:51:32.572 --> 00:51:34.194
Just absolutely phenomenal.

725
00:51:34.229 --> 00:51:37.404
It's not like any radar target
I've ever seen.

726
00:51:37.439 --> 00:51:40.959
traveling at an extremely
high rate of speed.

727
00:51:40.994 --> 00:51:43.997
It passed over
the control tower.

728
00:51:44.031 --> 00:51:47.863
and then it stopped.
It was an orangish color.

729
00:51:47.897 --> 00:51:50.072
Sort of popped into my mind
at the time

730
00:51:50.107 --> 00:51:53.006
that somebody's flying
a basketball out here.

731

There were. like.
lights around the center of it.

732
00:51:56.941 --> 00:51:58.977

a Ukrainian nuclear base
for nearly an hour.

740
00:52:29.939 --> 00:52:32.218
Inexplicably. several missiles

741
00:52:32.252 --> 00:52:35.359
suddenly switched to
full combat readiness

742
00:52:35.393 --> 00:52:40.950

as it had started.

DAVID SCHUUR:
As this object passed
over the missile site.

747
00:52:54.309 --> 00:52:57.691
we would start getting erratic indications on that missile.

748
00:52:57.726 --> 00:53:00.107
The bad thing was we also had a launch indicator.

749
00:53:00.142 --> 00:53:03.697
MAN: Does that mean that
the launch sequence
has been triggered?

750
00:53:03.732 --> 00:53:07.184
SCHURR: That means
that the missile has received
a launch signal.

751
00:53:07.218 --> 00:53:10.532
NARRATOR: The countdown
had to be manually aborted.

991
01:07:19.138 --> 01:07:21.002
and you don't hear
a sonic boom.

992
01:07:21.037 --> 01:07:23.142
How is that possible?
Another one is...

993
01:07:23.177 --> 01:07:25.489
NARRATOR: Elizondo's colleagues
took her aside

994
01:07:25.524 --> 01:07:28.527
to reveal some
extraordinary documentation

995
01:07:28.561 --> 01:07:31.047
related to the program.

996
01:07:31.081 --> 01:07:33.152
KEAN: I wasn't allowed
to take anything with me.

997
01:07:33.187 --> 01:07:35.948
I mean. the most importantevidence that was shared with me

998
01:07:35.982 --> 01:07:37.087
at the meeting regarding

999
01:07:37.122 --> 01:07:39.469
the phenomenon itself.
were the videos.

1000
01:07:43.507 --> 01:07:45.647
[MAN 1 SPEAKING]

1001
01:07:50.825 --> 01:07:53.655
I knew this was breaking news
for the front page of
The New York Times.

1002
01:07:58.074 --> 01:07:59.420
[MAN 2 SPEAKING]

1003
01:08:01.318 --> 01:08:02.457
[MAN 1 SPEAKING]

1004
01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:05.115
[MAN 2 SPEAKING]

1005
01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:07.462
KEAN: My co-author.
Ralph Blumenthal.

1006
01:08:07.497 --> 01:08:09.499
and I set up a meeting
with Mark Mazzetti

1007
01:08:09.533 --> 01:08:12.260
and said.
"We have this explosive story."

1008
01:08:12.295 --> 01:08:14.780
Sat down with him
in the New York office
of The New York Times

1009
01:08:14.814 --> 01:08:16.575
and we brought in
all the documents.

1010
01:08:16.609 --> 01:08:17.955
"These are the videos.

1011
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:20.441
Here's other documents
that show
the existence of the program.

1012
01:08:20.475 --> 01:08:23.306
And here's what they've studiedand here's what they've learned.

1013
01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:26.274
And there's a letter from
Harry Reid about the program."

1014
01:08:27.379 --> 01:08:29.070
NARRATOR: Elizondo's colleague.

1015
01:08:29.105 --> 01:08:31.245
the former deputy
assistant secretary

1016
01:08:31.279 --> 01:08:33.730
of defense for intelligence.

1017
01:08:33.764 --> 01:08:35.801
Christopher Mellon. managed to

1018
01:08:35.835 --> 01:08:38.079
obtain the tapes
from the Pentagon.

1019
01:08:38.114 --> 01:08:42.014
and choseThe New York Times
to break the story.

1020
01:08:42.048 --> 01:08:44.154
I received the videos.

1021
01:08:44.189 --> 01:08:47.226
the now-famous videos.
in the Pentagon parking lot

1022
01:08:47.261 --> 01:08:49.228
from a Defense
Department official.

1023
01:08:49.263 --> 01:08:51.851
I still have the originals
in the packaging.

1024
01:08:51.886 --> 01:08:56.339
This is a case where somebody
bent the rules a little bit.

1025
01:08:56.373 --> 01:09:00.170
and they did so
for the larger good.

1026
01:09:00.205 --> 01:09:03.898
And we're absolutely all
better off because of it.

1027
01:09:03.932 --> 01:09:05.175
In the end. I have to say.

1028
01:09:05.210 --> 01:09:07.039
I was still extraordinarily

1029
01:09:07.073 --> 01:09:09.697
disappointed with
The New York Times.

1030
01:09:09.731 --> 01:09:14.598
because they focused on this
small AATIP program.

1031
01:09:14.633 --> 01:09:18.326
And the real story. in my mind
at least. should have been.

1032
01:09:18.361 --> 01:09:21.812
"These things are real.
they're here.

1033
01:09:21.847 --> 01:09:23.676
This is happening now. "

1034
01:09:26.921 --> 01:09:28.647
NARRATOR: One of
the Pentagon cases

1035
01:09:28.681 --> 01:09:30.511
reported byThe New York Times.

1036
01:09:30.545 --> 01:09:33.203
was an encounter by
Naval aircraft.

1037
01:09:33.238 --> 01:09:37.932
about 200 miles off the coast
of San Diego. California.

1038
01:09:37.966 --> 01:09:39.175
Fifty-five hundred people
that were on

1039
01:09:39.209 --> 01:09:41.142
the Nimitzin 2004.
when this happened.

1040
01:09:41.177 --> 01:09:44.007
and I guarantee
every single one of them

1041
01:09:44.041 --> 01:09:45.733
knows that this event happened.

1042
01:09:45.767 --> 01:09:48.563
That's a whole air wing.That's Mount Fuji. That's Japan.

1043
01:09:48.598 --> 01:09:52.222
NARRATOR:
Commander David Fravor was leading a training exercise

1044
01:09:52.257 --> 01:09:55.501
from theUSS Nimitz
carrier strike group

1045
01:09:55.536 --> 01:09:59.781
when he was abruptly
ordered to investigate
an unknown target

1046
01:09:59.816 --> 01:10:03.475
that had appeared on one of the ship's radar scopes.

1047
01:10:03.509 --> 01:10:05.960
We're gonna suspend the training
we have real-world tasking.

1048
01:10:05.994 --> 01:10:07.651
So we're like. "Okay. cool. "

1049
01:10:07.686 --> 01:10:10.861
NARRATOR: He and another
F-18 Super Hornet.

1050
01:10:10.896 --> 01:10:15.141
each carrying two airmen. zoomed toward the coordinates.

1051
01:10:15.176 --> 01:10:17.385
It was myself and my WSO

1052
01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:19.422
and the other pilot and the WSO
in the back seat

1053
01:10:19.456 --> 01:10:21.113
of that airplane.
So. there's four of us.

1054
01:10:23.011 --> 01:10:24.565
NARRATOR: When they arrived.
they first saw

1055
01:10:24.599 --> 01:10:27.326
what appeared to be
a large object

1056
01:10:27.361 --> 01:10:29.984
slightly below the surface
of the ocean.

1057
01:10:30.018 --> 01:10:32.400
with a strange
oval-shaped craft

1058
01:10:32.435 --> 01:10:35.576
darting around
in the air just above it.

1059
01:10:35.610 --> 01:10:38.993
If you picture a Tic Tac
that's about 40 feet long.

1060
01:10:39.027 --> 01:10:41.064
round on both ends. no rivets.

1061
01:10:41.098 --> 01:10:43.687
no metal. smooth. white.
It was white.

1062
01:10:43.722 --> 01:10:47.208
It was just smooth. No wings.
no propulsion. no windows.

1063
01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:50.211
It didn't matter which way it
was pointing because as it
was moving over the water.

1064
01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:53.525
it never turned. It never
changed its longitudinal axis.

1065
01:10:53.559 --> 01:10:56.769
It went fore. aft. left. right.
It was just doing this.

1066
01:10:56.804 --> 01:10:59.703
And I said. "Hey. I'm gonna go
check that out."

1067
01:11:04.743 --> 01:11:07.297
All of a sudden. you just see itturn its body and go... [WHOOP]

1068
01:11:07.332 --> 01:11:08.954
And start coming up at you.
You go.

1069
01:11:08.988 --> 01:11:11.543
"That was rather interesting."

1070
01:11:11.577 --> 01:11:14.960
We're just looking at it.
We're doing this.
We're looking at it.

1071
01:11:14.994 --> 01:11:16.962
We're looking at it.
We go around.

1072
01:11:16.996 --> 01:11:18.964
All the way around the outside
of a circle. 180 degrees.

1073
01:11:18.998 --> 01:11:22.623
Well. I know where he's going.
so I'll just go over there.

1074
01:11:27.179 --> 01:11:29.319
This thing goes "poof"
and it's gone.

1075
01:11:29.354 --> 01:11:33.185
I mean. literally that fast.
Gone.

1076
01:11:34.738 --> 01:11:36.222
You can think about what
we're saying. Like.

1077
01:11:36.257 --> 01:11:39.329
"Holy shit. What the...is that?"

1078
01:11:39.364 --> 01:11:41.987
And then there's a lot of.
"Dude. what the...

1079
01:11:42.021 --> 01:11:43.333
Did you guys see that?

1080
01:11:43.368 --> 01:11:45.059
Do you guys see it?"
And they're like.

1081
01:11:45.093 --> 01:11:47.164
"It's gone. We don't see shit."

1082
01:11:48.269 --> 01:11:52.238
Nothing accelerates that fast.
You're talking...

1083
01:11:52.273 --> 01:11:54.413
Something that
not only accelerated

1084
01:11:54.448 --> 01:11:56.795
beyond anything
that we had seen.

1085
01:11:56.829 --> 01:11:58.452
but it just was...

1086
01:12:00.177 --> 01:12:01.593
The controller
comes up and says.

1087
01:12:01.627 --> 01:12:03.733
"Hey. you're not gonna
believe this.

1088
01:12:03.767 --> 01:12:07.012
but that thing is back
at your CAD point."

1089
01:12:07.046 --> 01:12:11.119
NARRATOR: Meaning
the object had instantly
reappeared at the precise

1090
01:12:11.154 --> 01:12:13.432
secret coordinates
of the fleet's

1091
01:12:13.467 --> 01:12:17.056
critical aerial defense zone.

1092
01:12:17.091 --> 01:12:19.127
FRAVOR: It obviously had
some awareness.

1093
01:12:19.162 --> 01:12:21.544
It knew where we were going.

1094
01:12:21.578 --> 01:12:25.375
It'll make the hair on
the back of your neck stand up.

1095
01:12:25.410 --> 01:12:27.308
I actually told my back seater.
I said.

1096
01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:29.828
"I don't know about you.
I'm pretty weirded out."

1097
01:12:32.589 --> 01:12:35.592
NARRATOR: More jets equipped
with the Navy's most advanced

1098
01:12:35.627 --> 01:12:40.425
radar visual tracking systems
were scrambled.

1099
01:12:40.459 --> 01:12:43.980
This time. capturing
the object on video.

1100
01:12:44.014 --> 01:12:46.845
FRAVOR: First thing he gets is
a little blip on the radar.

1101
01:12:46.879 --> 01:12:51.988
He puts his cursors over it.
and he tries to grab
a lock on it.

1102
01:12:53.921 --> 01:12:55.198
Basically. when you take a lock.

1103
01:12:55.232 --> 01:12:58.063
you tell the radar.
"Look at that location.

1104
01:12:58.097 --> 01:13:01.411
and stare at it. and put all
your energy on that point."

1105
01:13:01.446 --> 01:13:03.862
Well. as soon as it does it.
the radar gets indications

1106
01:13:03.896 --> 01:13:06.727
that it's being jammed by
the object it's trying to lock.

1107
01:13:10.109 --> 01:13:12.388
The infrared sees
differing temperatures.

1108
01:13:12.422 --> 01:13:15.839
so the Tic Tac is hotter
than the air around it.

1109
01:13:15.874 --> 01:13:18.980
It doesn't have to be by much.
but it's gonna appear white.

1110
01:13:19.015 --> 01:13:20.499
They're driving straight at it.

1111
01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:23.571
It's just kind of
hovering there.

1112
01:13:23.606 --> 01:13:27.368
And then it goes "poof"
and it takes off. off the side.

1113
01:13:29.819 --> 01:13:33.409
I just don't know.
I doubt that we...

1114
01:13:33.443 --> 01:13:35.549
have developed that technology.

1115
01:13:37.758 --> 01:13:41.865
I interviewed
three of the four aviators

1116
01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:44.972
who were with Dave.
during that encounter.

1117
01:13:45.006 --> 01:13:49.355
and it was readily apparent
to everyone involved that

1118
01:13:49.390 --> 01:13:51.599
that vehicle had what they call

1119
01:13:51.634 --> 01:13:54.015
"dominant
battlespace awareness."

1120
01:13:54.050 --> 01:13:58.951
It was in control of that
engagement from the outset.

1121
01:13:58.986 --> 01:14:03.369
There was no question
that it completely outmatched

1122
01:14:03.404 --> 01:14:05.613
our frontline fighters.

1123
01:14:05.648 --> 01:14:09.583
I served on the Special Access
Program Oversight Committee.

1124
01:14:09.617 --> 01:14:12.551
so I had access to all
of the black programs
in those days.

1125
01:14:12.586 --> 01:14:14.760
We know perfectly well
there's nothing like that

1126
01:14:14.795 --> 01:14:17.867
behind the scenes
or even on the drawing boards.

1127
01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:22.596
NARRATOR: Senator Harry Reid.
who instigated

1128
01:14:22.630 --> 01:14:25.633
the secret
Pentagon UFO program.

1129
01:14:25.668 --> 01:14:28.325
confirmed what nuclear
launch officers

1130
01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:30.604
have been
reporting for decades.

1131
01:14:32.537 --> 01:14:35.367
NARRATOR: UFOs have interfered
with our country's

1132
01:14:35.401 --> 01:14:37.818
most powerful weapons.

1133
01:14:43.755 --> 01:14:45.584
Did you have anybody

1134
01:14:45.619 --> 01:14:48.622
in the Defense Department.
the Pentagon.

1135
01:14:48.656 --> 01:14:54.075
pull you aside.
bend your ear and say.
"Why are you doing this?"

1136
01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:55.732
They did everything they could

1137
01:14:55.767 --> 01:14:58.079
to stop the program
from going forward.

1138
01:14:58.114 --> 01:15:01.876
They gave the person that came
in initially such a bad time.

1139
01:15:01.911 --> 01:15:03.844
He's fortunate to have
hung on to his job

1140
01:15:03.878 --> 01:15:05.673
because people tried
to get rid of him.

1141
01:15:05.708 --> 01:15:08.987
because they wanted nothing
to do with this.

1142
01:15:09.021 --> 01:15:13.301
The Defense Intelligence Agency
was one of the worst.

1143
01:15:13.336 --> 01:15:14.820
They drug their feet.

1144
01:15:14.855 --> 01:15:17.513
even though there was
one of their senior scientists

1145
01:15:17.547 --> 01:15:19.342
thought they should look
at this.

1146
01:15:19.376 --> 01:15:22.345
And remember.
all we're saying...

1147
01:15:22.379 --> 01:15:26.004
Nobody has to agree
why it's there.

1148
01:15:26.038 --> 01:15:28.938
But shouldn't we at least
be spending some money

1149
01:15:28.972 --> 01:15:30.974
to study all these phenomenon?

1150
01:15:31.009 --> 01:15:35.082
Shouldn't we study this stuff?
The answer is yes.

1151
01:15:35.116 --> 01:15:36.911
And that's all this was about.

1152
01:15:36.946 --> 01:15:41.813
and why the federal government.all these years. has covered up.

1153
01:15:41.847 --> 01:15:45.541
put brake pads on everything.
Stopped it.

1154
01:15:45.575 --> 01:15:48.923
I think it's very. very bad
for our country.

1155
01:15:54.515 --> 01:15:56.517
I interviewed Gordon Cooper.

1156
01:15:56.552 --> 01:15:59.244
Mercury astronaut Gordon Cooper.back in the '90s.

1157
01:15:59.278 --> 01:16:01.211
REPORTER: Cooper said on camera

1158
01:16:01.246 --> 01:16:04.594
that there was
a landed UFO circa 1957

1159
01:16:04.629 --> 01:16:06.941
at Edwards Air Force Base.
His camera crew captured

1160
01:16:06.976 --> 01:16:08.633
the filming of this object.

1161
01:16:08.667 --> 01:16:13.051
and he presented this
to the higher-ups

1162
01:16:13.085 --> 01:16:15.709
and eventually. a courier jet
came in from Washington.

1163
01:16:15.743 --> 01:16:18.263
He handed the footage over.
which was good. he viewed it--

1164
01:16:18.297 --> 01:16:19.954
-That's the last he saw of it.
-Exactly.

1165
01:16:19.989 --> 01:16:21.715
REPORTER: Did you know
where that footage went

1166
01:16:21.749 --> 01:16:24.372
of the flying saucer
that landed on the...

1167
01:16:24.407 --> 01:16:26.478
Went to Washington.
That's all that I know.

1168
01:16:26.512 --> 01:16:28.687
REPORTER: Did you ever keep
in touch with anybody about it
or discuss it?

1169
01:16:28.722 --> 01:16:31.828
How would I keep in touch
with anybody about it?

1170
01:16:31.863 --> 01:16:34.624
There's no way
within the military
or within the government

1171
01:16:34.659 --> 01:16:37.627
of keeping track of something
that is classified.

1172
01:16:37.662 --> 01:16:40.354
REPORTER: Did you try to go
after stuff like this?

1173
01:16:40.388 --> 01:16:42.598
We did. We have. It's there.

1174
01:16:42.632 --> 01:16:47.603
Are you saying that
there's some evidence that's...

1175
01:16:47.637 --> 01:16:49.984
REPORTER: Still hasn't seen
the light of day?

1176
01:16:51.192 --> 01:16:54.437
I'm saying most of it
hasn't seen the light of day.

1177
01:16:59.373 --> 01:17:01.444
MELLON:
Astronaut Cooper had spoken

1178
01:17:01.478 --> 01:17:03.791
with the President
at a Cabinet meeting.

1179
01:17:03.826 --> 01:17:06.138
He raised this
with Secretary Cohen.

1180
01:17:06.173 --> 01:17:09.452
And then Cohen's office
called me and asked me

1181
01:17:09.486 --> 01:17:12.489
to pursue this
and chase it down.

1182
01:17:15.941 --> 01:17:19.427
The Air Force colonel that I
spoke with got very frustrated.

1183
01:17:19.462 --> 01:17:22.327
and when I asked him
what happened to all
of these records. he said.

1184
01:17:22.361 --> 01:17:26.124
"Well. that was all cleaned up
or thrown out to save space."

1185
01:17:26.158 --> 01:17:27.263
something like that.

1186
01:17:27.297 --> 01:17:30.715
It sounded ludicrous.
but that's what he told me.

1187
01:17:32.855 --> 01:17:36.962
If there is some
recovered debris. say...

1188
01:17:37.963 --> 01:17:41.587
It is so deeply buried
and squirreled away

1189
01:17:41.622 --> 01:17:46.696
that it's outside of those
normal oversight processes.

1190
01:17:46.731 --> 01:17:50.079
and that's where
there's a problem in this area.

1191
01:17:56.741 --> 01:17:58.881
NARRATOR:
Dr. Jacques Vallee
has collected

1192
01:17:58.915 --> 01:18:02.125
purported metal debris
from UFO cases

1193
01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:05.335
dating as far back as 1947

1194
01:18:05.370 --> 01:18:09.719
that experts are analyzing in a state-of-the-art laboratory.

1195
01:18:09.754 --> 01:18:13.619
The breakthrough has come
with the invention of a machine

1196
01:18:13.654 --> 01:18:17.071
that enables usto look at the atomic structure.

1197
01:18:17.106 --> 01:18:18.452
and at that point.

1198
01:18:18.486 --> 01:18:21.731
the atomic structure
is impossible to fake.

1199
01:18:21.766 --> 01:18:25.804
This device is a multi-parameterion beam imager.

1200
01:18:25.839 --> 01:18:29.463
NARRATOR: Dr. Garry Nolan.
a Stanford microbiologist.

1201
01:18:29.497 --> 01:18:33.847
is using a revolutionary
three-dimensional
imaging device

1202
01:18:33.881 --> 01:18:39.542
to analyze the samples right down to their individual atoms.

1203
01:18:39.576 --> 01:18:42.096
When Dr. Nolan placed
some of the fragments

1204
01:18:42.131 --> 01:18:44.547
in the vacuum chamber
of his instrument.

1205
01:18:44.581 --> 01:18:47.584
he was astonished
to find their composition

1206
01:18:47.619 --> 01:18:49.759
was unlike any known metal.

1207
01:18:49.794 --> 01:18:54.833
Just one spot and the isotopic
composition all the way across.

1208
01:18:54.868 --> 01:18:56.697
NARRATOR: No matter
where he looked

1209
01:18:56.732 --> 01:18:58.872
in the sample's
jumble of elements.

1210
01:18:58.906 --> 01:19:02.703
whether magnesium. iron.
nickel or titanium.

1211
01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:06.776
the ratio of isotopes
didn't make any sense.

1212
01:19:06.811 --> 01:19:11.781
If you're talking about
an advanced material
from an advanced civilization.

1213
01:19:11.816 --> 01:19:13.058
you're talking about
something that...

1214
01:19:13.093 --> 01:19:15.440
I'll just call it
an ultra-material. right?

1215
01:19:15.474 --> 01:19:17.960
It's something
which has properties

1216
01:19:17.994 --> 01:19:21.273
where somebody
is putting it together.

1217
01:19:21.308 --> 01:19:22.999
again. at the atomic scale.

1218
01:19:23.034 --> 01:19:28.936
So we're building our world
with 80 elements.

1219
01:19:28.971 --> 01:19:31.421
Somebody else is building
the world

1220
01:19:31.456 --> 01:19:34.908
with 253 different isotopes.

1221
01:19:36.944 --> 01:19:41.569
I intend to use the information
to try to build something.

1222
01:19:41.604 --> 01:19:43.537
Try to understand
a physical principle

1223
01:19:43.571 --> 01:19:45.159
that we don't know today.

1224
01:19:45.194 --> 01:19:49.060
This material was manufactured.
It's not natural.

1225
01:19:49.094 --> 01:19:53.616
It's not natural
to the materials
that we have around us

1226
01:19:53.650 --> 01:19:55.894
in the lab. or on the Earth.

1227
01:19:55.929 --> 01:19:58.932
It does not mean
that it was necessarily

1228
01:19:58.966 --> 01:20:01.797
made some place in outer space.

1229
01:20:01.831 --> 01:20:04.523
It just means that
it was manufactured

1230
01:20:04.558 --> 01:20:07.043
specially for
a particular purpose

1231
01:20:07.078 --> 01:20:10.322
that we don't understand.
and we want to understand it.

1232
01:20:17.951 --> 01:20:21.713
MELLON: There is an immense
array of unanswered questions.

1233
01:20:23.094 --> 01:20:27.270
When we observe
some of these craft doing.

1234
01:20:27.305 --> 01:20:29.479
think about the possibilities.

1235
01:20:29.514 --> 01:20:32.482
what we may
discover technologically.

1236
01:20:32.517 --> 01:20:34.519
how we might solve
the energy crisis.

1237
01:20:34.553 --> 01:20:36.970
how we might raise
our standards of living.

1238
01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:40.870
There is an urgent need.
in my view.

1239
01:20:40.905 --> 01:20:42.251
to get to the bottom of it.

1240
01:20:42.285 --> 01:20:44.736
We don't know
the origin of these vehicles

1241
01:20:44.770 --> 01:20:46.738
nor do we understand
the intent

1242
01:20:46.772 --> 01:20:49.361
of whoever
is controlling them.

1243
01:20:51.916 --> 01:20:55.643
NARRATOR: There are cases that
seem to go beyond encounters

1244
01:20:55.678 --> 01:20:57.818
with an advanced technology.

1245
01:20:57.853 --> 01:21:01.201
to contact with
an engaged intelligence.

1246
01:21:02.029 --> 01:21:05.861
Papua New Guinea. June. 1959

1247
01:21:05.895 --> 01:21:09.554
An Australian missionary
spots a large disc

1248
01:21:09.588 --> 01:21:12.764
hovering just 200 feet
off the ground

1249
01:21:12.798 --> 01:21:15.905
while standing
with 38 other people.

1250
01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:20.910
This solid-looking
object and...
Can you imagine?

1251
01:21:20.945 --> 01:21:23.809
What it's like
to look up in the sky

1252
01:21:23.844 --> 01:21:27.917
and see some figures
up there?

1253
01:21:27.952 --> 01:21:32.266
NARRATOR:
All were amazed to see
four small occupants

1254
01:21:32.301 --> 01:21:35.994
dressed in what looked
like black diving suits.

1255
01:21:36.029 --> 01:21:39.825
Figures walking about on top.

1256
01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:43.622
and not the slightest noise
whatsoever.

1257
01:21:43.657 --> 01:21:46.453
And so we waved.

1258
01:21:47.454 --> 01:21:48.834
Wouldn't it be wonderful

1259
01:21:48.869 --> 01:21:52.597
if we could get this object
down onto the playing field?

1260
01:21:52.631 --> 01:21:54.737
And as we waved.

1261
01:21:54.771 --> 01:21:57.222
wondering whether
we'd get some recognition

1262
01:21:57.257 --> 01:21:58.706
and whether. perhaps.

1263
01:21:58.741 --> 01:22:01.226
they would understand
what we wanted.

1264
01:22:01.261 --> 01:22:04.057
they waved back.

1265
01:22:04.091 --> 01:22:06.956
NARRATOR: The encounter
lasted several hours

1266
01:22:06.991 --> 01:22:10.235
before the object
abruptly departed.

1267
01:22:10.270 --> 01:22:13.929
There was this amazingly
incredible speed

1268
01:22:13.963 --> 01:22:19.210
that the hovercraft
disappeared to nothing

1269
01:22:19.244 --> 01:22:22.834
across the bay in a matter
of a second or so.

1270
01:22:26.976 --> 01:22:28.840
NARRATOR: In 1994.

1271
01:22:28.874 --> 01:22:31.981
three days of sightings
across Zimbabwe

1272
01:22:32.016 --> 01:22:34.121
culminated in what
some believe

1273
01:22:34.156 --> 01:22:36.848
is the most significant
close encounter

1274
01:22:36.882 --> 01:22:38.815
in modern history.

1275
01:22:39.816 --> 01:22:42.198
Hundreds of people today
phoned the ZBC

1276
01:22:42.233 --> 01:22:44.718
and BBC correspondent
in Harare

1277
01:22:44.752 --> 01:22:50.172
saying they sighted
an unidentified flying object
last night.

1278
01:22:50.206 --> 01:22:52.381
We have some
eyewitness reports.

1279
01:22:53.416 --> 01:22:55.142
MAN: It almost seemed to be
under the cloud.

1280
01:22:55.177 --> 01:22:57.248
As it came past.
I noticed there's no noise.

1281
01:22:57.282 --> 01:22:59.940
and that's when I thought.
"Well. there's something
very odd here."

1282
01:22:59.975 --> 01:23:02.356
It was quite amazing.
It was beautiful.

1283
01:23:02.391 --> 01:23:06.947
They are saying that Jesus
is passing through Africa.

1284
01:23:06.982 --> 01:23:08.845
That's what they are saying.

1285
01:23:19.856 --> 01:23:22.756
TIM LEACH: We interviewed
about 64 children

1286
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:24.068
in front of the camera.

1287
01:23:24.102 --> 01:23:25.862
UFO story that happens...

1288
01:23:25.897 --> 01:23:28.900
Just say exactly
what you want to say. okay?

1289
01:23:28.934 --> 01:23:32.214
Well. I was running
and playing.

1290
01:23:32.248 --> 01:23:35.010
and then I saw this maroon colorin the sky.

1291
01:23:35.044 --> 01:23:36.252
Why don't we follow it?

1292
01:23:36.287 --> 01:23:39.600
We saw this. like.
a silver thing down there.

1293
01:23:39.635 --> 01:23:42.051
It was a silver oval thing

1294
01:23:42.086 --> 01:23:44.640
that flew past really slowly.

1295
01:23:44.674 --> 01:23:48.092
I saw the bigger one
and the spaceship.
like. four or five of them.

1296
01:23:48.126 --> 01:23:50.025
It was red.
green and yellow.

1297
01:23:50.059 --> 01:23:51.267
There was this big ship.

1298
01:23:51.302 --> 01:23:53.994
It had these lights.
these patterns. and it flew.

1299
01:23:54.029 --> 01:23:56.755
I thought.
"No. it's not a UFO."

1300
01:23:56.790 --> 01:23:58.550
And then I looked
carefully at it.

1301
01:23:58.585 --> 01:23:59.586
and I thought. "Maybe."

1302
01:24:05.109 --> 01:24:06.834
NARRATOR:
Dozens of children said that

1303
01:24:06.869 --> 01:24:09.216
one or more
of the disc-shaped objects

1304
01:24:09.251 --> 01:24:12.633
landed just beyond
the far edge
of their playground.

1305
01:24:15.671 --> 01:24:17.880
The next thing they knew.

1306
01:24:17.914 --> 01:24:20.641
something was standing
next to it.

1307
01:24:24.369 --> 01:24:28.097
You saw him standing
by the silver thing.

1308
01:24:28.132 --> 01:24:29.892
And he had big eyes.

1309
01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:36.657
He had a big head
and big black eyes.

1310
01:24:36.692 --> 01:24:38.866
and was dressed
in a black bodysuit.

1311
01:24:38.901 --> 01:24:40.661
They were wearing
pure black.

1312
01:24:40.696 --> 01:24:44.596
And I came down
and I saw the funny man
with his eyes here.

1313
01:24:44.631 --> 01:24:45.942
and I saw a spaceship.

1314
01:24:45.977 --> 01:24:48.462
and there were a few
little ones around it.

1315
01:24:54.572 --> 01:24:57.161
REPORTER:
How far away were you
when you saw him?

1316
01:24:57.195 --> 01:25:00.302
Not very far. Not very far.
About a meter away.

1317
01:25:00.336 --> 01:25:02.442
-A meter away? That close?
-Yes.

1318
01:25:05.445 --> 01:25:07.205
REPORTER:
And how big was the figure?

1319
01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:10.312
It was about
as big as a grade six.

1320
01:25:10.346 --> 01:25:11.934
Yeah. it's there!

1321
01:25:11.968 --> 01:25:15.593
I believe that the children
did see something.

1322
01:25:15.627 --> 01:25:20.253
I believe them
because normally
children don't lie.

1323
01:25:20.287 --> 01:25:22.772
I've always taught my children.
"Seeing is believing."

1324
01:25:22.807 --> 01:25:24.912
Unfortunately.
I didn't see. So...

NARRATOR:
This alleged encounter

1327
01:25:32.127 --> 01:25:34.543
caught the attention
of Pulitzer Prize-winning

1328
01:25:34.577 --> 01:25:37.994
Harvard psychiatrist.
Dr. John Mack.

1329
01:25:38.029 --> 01:25:39.720
It seemed that he was
looking at all of us.

1330
01:25:39.755 --> 01:25:42.930
What did it feel like
when he was looking at you?

1331
01:25:42.965 --> 01:25:44.449
It felt scared.

1332
01:25:44.484 --> 01:25:47.418
It felt scary?
What was scary about it?

1333
01:25:48.488 --> 01:25:50.421
Well. felt scared

1334
01:25:50.455 --> 01:25:54.597
because I've never seen
such a... person
like that before.

1335
01:25:54.632 --> 01:25:58.946
And I saw this... person.

1336
01:25:58.981 --> 01:26:01.708
And it had big eyes.

1337
01:26:01.742 --> 01:26:04.193
That's all I saw about it.
Big eyes.

1338
01:26:04.228 --> 01:26:07.472
-They had short legs
and quite a long top.
-Mmm-hmm.

1339
01:26:07.507 --> 01:26:09.198
With a big head

1340
01:26:09.233 --> 01:26:11.718
and eyes
that are bigger than ours.

1341
01:26:11.752 --> 01:26:14.583
How much bigger than ours?

1342
01:26:14.617 --> 01:26:15.860
Four or five times the size.

1343
01:26:15.894 --> 01:26:18.449
Four or five times
the size of ours?

1344
01:26:20.865 --> 01:26:22.211
And then I was looking
at him. right?

1345
01:26:22.246 --> 01:26:24.075
-Yes.
-Then he was looking
at me back.

1346
01:26:24.109 --> 01:26:25.904
How can I just keep on
looking at him?

1347
01:26:25.939 --> 01:26:28.148
So I had to stop
and I looked sideways.

1348
01:26:28.183 --> 01:26:30.288
But I was looking
straight into his eyes.

1349
01:26:30.323 --> 01:26:32.911
Well. he never said anything.

1350
01:26:32.946 --> 01:26:35.673
It's just the face
and the eyes.

1351
01:26:35.707 --> 01:26:39.297
Maybe they're trying
to communicate with us.

1352
01:26:39.332 --> 01:26:42.162
Show us something
which we don't know about.

1353
01:26:42.197 --> 01:26:44.682

1354

people to know that

1355
01:26:48.479 --> 01:26:51.999
we're actually making harm
on this world.

and we mustn't get
too technological.

1357
01:26:54.278 --> 01:26:56.521
We don't look
after the planet.

1358
01:26:56.556 --> 01:27:01.146
All the trees
will be cut down...

1359
01:27:01.181 --> 01:27:03.873
and there will be no air
and people will be dying.

1360
01:27:03.908 --> 01:27:07.774
Is this an idea
you have had before?

1361
01:27:07.808 --> 01:27:13.642
Or did this idea come to you
when you had this experience?

1362
01:27:15.506 --> 01:27:18.888
-When I had this experience.
-Mmm-hmm.

they shared

1367

that September morning.

1368
01:27:30.831 --> 01:27:32.350
I remember something there...

1369
01:27:32.385 --> 01:27:35.388
One they all still
struggle to understand.

1370
01:27:35.422 --> 01:27:37.286

but you...

SALMA SIDDICK:
I stand by what I saw.

1372
01:27:39.426 --> 01:27:44.155
There was no reason
for any of us.

1373
01:27:44.189 --> 01:27:45.984
to make that up.

1374
01:27:46.019 --> 01:27:48.780
EMMA JELIC KRISTIANSEN:
I've not spoken
to anybody about it.

1375
01:27:48.815 --> 01:27:50.161
Not because
I'm not proud of it.

1376
01:27:50.195 --> 01:27:53.682
but because I don't
want the... The stigma.

So it's something that

1378
01:27:57.341 --> 01:28:01.828
I've had to deal with
for 19-and-a-half years.

1379
01:28:03.381 --> 01:28:04.969
I don't wanna say
I felt like I knew it.

1380
01:28:05.003 --> 01:28:07.454
-but I knew that I didn't
have to be afraid of it.
-Yeah.

1381
01:28:07.489 --> 01:28:10.146
NARRATOR: They took us back
to the moment of contact.

1382
01:28:10.181 --> 01:28:12.217

Exactly...

01:28:12.252 --> 01:28:15.428
The details
still seared into memory.

1384
01:28:15.462 --> 01:28:19.017
I was with one of the other
girls and saying to her.

1385
01:28:19.052 --> 01:28:21.157
"This is amazing."

1386
01:28:21.192 --> 01:28:24.160
We all were just
stopped in our tracks.

1387
01:28:25.369 --> 01:28:28.682
A little man appeared.

1388
01:28:28.717 --> 01:28:30.477
On top of the actual craft.

1389
01:28:30.512 --> 01:28:33.342
And that moment. for me.
was very distinct.

1390
01:28:33.377 --> 01:28:35.379
because I was like.
"That's not human."

1391
01:28:35.413 --> 01:28:38.520
Well. I was just completely
engulfed in these eyes.

1392
01:28:38.554 --> 01:28:41.523
The eyes. and in that moment.
however long it was.

1393
01:28:41.557 --> 01:28:43.939
'cause I have no idea
of the time frame.

1394
01:28:43.973 --> 01:28:45.458
it was just mesmerizing.

1395
01:28:45.492 --> 01:28:50.773
There was no talking.
Um... It's all just images
in the head.

1396
01:28:53.328 --> 01:28:55.330
Telepathic communication.

1397
01:28:56.365 --> 01:28:58.367

to communicate.

1398
01:28:58.402 --> 01:29:00.369
Trying to tell us something.

1399
01:29:00.404 --> 01:29:02.785
or something to do
with the environment.

1400
01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:04.166
I kept getting
these thoughts

1401
01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:06.271
and ideas in my mind
of technology.

1402
01:29:06.306 --> 01:29:09.171
Technology is not helping.
technology is bad...

1403
01:29:12.312 --> 01:29:15.039
And we're going down
a wrong path.

1404
01:29:15.073 --> 01:29:16.868
and we have to start
recognizing that

1405
01:29:16.903 --> 01:29:19.802
what we're doing is detrimental
and we need to make changes.

1406
01:29:19.837 --> 01:29:24.324
And I don't know
what to do with that. or...

1407
01:29:26.361 --> 01:29:28.432
They were reaching out to us.

1408
01:29:28.466 --> 01:29:30.882
It was as if they wanted us
to go with them.

1409
01:29:32.643 --> 01:29:35.231
At that moment.
that was kind of

1410
01:29:35.266 --> 01:29:39.650
when I snapped
right out of the trance.

1411
01:29:39.684 --> 01:29:44.240
As soon as I broke contact.
all of those feelings.
technology. the bad.

1412
01:29:44.275 --> 01:29:46.277
the horribleness
that was happening

1413
01:29:46.311 --> 01:29:49.556
and going around my body
at the time went.

1414
01:29:49.591 --> 01:29:52.145
It's making me a bit anxious
being back here.

1415
01:29:52.179 --> 01:29:55.631
I can feel it right now.
I was scared.

1416
01:29:56.563 --> 01:29:59.290
They came running up here
in such a panic.

1417
01:29:59.324 --> 01:30:03.121
screaming. screaming... Ah!
Then we were here.

1418
01:30:03.156 --> 01:30:04.537
And a child
can't make that up.

1419

SUSAN KRISTIANSEN:
So I was there when they
were interviewing them

1420
01:30:08.195 --> 01:30:10.474
and saw the way they were.

1421
01:30:10.508 --> 01:30:13.511
It was just a huge. big mess
and muddle-up

1422
01:30:13.546 --> 01:30:15.582
and just people everywhere.

1423
01:30:15.617 --> 01:30:18.205
Just ask them questions
straight off

1424
01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:19.586
without explaining
to the children

1425
01:30:19.621 --> 01:30:22.209
what they were doing
and why they were doing it.

1426
01:30:22.244 --> 01:30:23.521
It was chaos

1427
01:30:23.556 --> 01:30:26.593
in terms of the media frenzy
that was going on.

1428
01:30:26.628 --> 01:30:30.010
and us being so young.
and not even...

1429
01:30:31.460 --> 01:30:33.842
being allowed time
to comprehend
what we had seen.

1430
01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:37.259
Our teachers certainly
didn't believe us.

1431
01:30:37.293 --> 01:30:38.467
So. that was a big deal.

1432
01:30:38.502 --> 01:30:40.469
'cause we had to continue
going to school there.

1433

We went back one last time
to the Ariel School

1434
01:30:47.165 --> 01:30:48.650

of the incident

1436
01:30:51.100 --> 01:30:53.344
and now the headmistress.

1437
01:30:53.378 --> 01:30:55.484
Something was weighing on her

1438
01:30:55.519 --> 01:30:58.383
that she wanted
to tell the children.

1439
01:30:58.418 --> 01:31:00.006
Yeah. I said
I wanted to apologize.

1440
01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:02.629
I should have taken more notice.

1441
01:31:02.664 --> 01:31:06.461
But I didn't.
I was more concerned
about me and not them.

1442
01:31:06.495 --> 01:31:10.499
And what was going on
in my own sort of experience.

1443
01:31:10.534 --> 01:31:12.743
Well. that's what... Yeah.

1444

in just one sentence

Aliens visited us. [CHUCKLES]

1449
01:31:31.037 --> 01:31:32.659
And that's about it. yeah.

1450
01:31:32.694 --> 01:31:34.454
That's why if you believe it.
you believe it.

1451
01:31:34.489 --> 01:31:36.387
If you don't. well...

NARRATOR:We find ourselves
confronted with something

1453
01:31:42.945 --> 01:31:47.536
that challenges our very
understanding of reality.

1454
01:31:47.571 --> 01:31:51.506
We may be sharing this
fragile blue-green oasis

1455
01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:54.129
with an unknown other.

1456
01:31:54.163 --> 01:31:58.133
One with a mysterious
relationship to humanity.

1457
01:31:58.167 --> 01:32:01.999
and its own interest
in our world.

1458
01:32:03.207 --> 01:32:05.554
And if you saw him again.
what would you do?

1459
01:32:05.589 --> 01:32:08.108
I'll ask him
what is he doing on Earth.

1460
01:32:08.143 --> 01:32:10.110
and what does he want with us.

1461
01:33:45.861 --> 01:33:49.624
There were well-observed
UFO cases.

1462
01:33:49.658 --> 01:33:53.144
just like modern cases.
in the 18th century.

1463
01:33:53.179 --> 01:33:54.870
In the 17th century.

1464
01:33:54.905 --> 01:33:55.940
There was science.

1465
01:33:55.975 --> 01:33:58.702
There were astronomers.
they had telescopes.

1466
01:33:58.736 --> 01:34:01.118
and they were
very good observers

1467
01:34:01.152 --> 01:34:04.742
because their life depended
on being good observers.

1468
01:34:04.777 --> 01:34:07.814
And these observations come
from all over the world.

1469
01:34:09.298 --> 01:34:11.128
They just have been forgotten.

1470
01:34:37.672 --> 01:34:42.607
I like to think of anomalies.
mysteries. as opportunities.

1471
01:34:42.642 --> 01:34:44.920
and we'll go
after those mysteries.

1472
01:34:44.955 --> 01:34:47.889
take the torch
away from the campfire.

1473
01:34:47.923 --> 01:34:50.823
and out of the cave.
into the darkness

1474
01:34:50.857 --> 01:34:53.239
and make some
amazing discoveries.

1475
01:35:15.468 --> 01:35:19.644
The UFO phenomenon as studied
by my colleagues and myself.

1476
01:35:19.679 --> 01:35:22.993
bespeaks the action of
some form of intelligence.

1477
01:35:35.833 --> 01:35:38.042
[SPEAKING IN OTHER LANGUAGE]

1478
01:36:00.375 --> 01:36:03.240
These objects
gave the impression

1479
01:36:03.274 --> 01:36:05.276
that they wanted to be seen...

1480
01:36:06.484 --> 01:36:09.556
with these enormous spotlights.

1481
01:36:09.591 --> 01:36:12.939
There was no way that
they were trying to hide.

1482
01:36:12.974 --> 01:36:15.804
So why?
That is the main question.

1483
01:36:15.839 --> 01:36:19.152
Why do these objects
want to be seen?

1484
01:36:40.553 --> 01:36:43.590
Later on. I was so sorry

1485
01:36:43.625 --> 01:36:47.836
that why I did not call
on the radio.

1486
01:36:47.871 --> 01:36:51.012
Ask them. "Who are you?

"Please.
make communication with us."

enough and capable enough

1489
01:37:15.519 --> 01:37:17.866
[CHUCKLES]
to come into our airspace

1490
01:37:17.901 --> 01:37:19.557
with the technology
that they have.

1491
01:37:19.592 --> 01:37:22.422
if they wanted to do us in.
they could have done us in
a long time ago.

1492
01:37:22.457 --> 01:37:25.011
So. I'm not fearful
of this at all.

1493
01:37:34.779 --> 01:37:36.954
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

1494
01:38:35.979 --> 01:38:37.877
Every once in a while
one of them goes. zip!

1495
01:38:37.912 --> 01:38:39.396
It went like a bat out of hell.

1496
01:38:39.430 --> 01:38:42.226
Jumped about ten degrees
to the right. Just like this.

1497
01:38:42.261 --> 01:38:45.609
I've never seen anything
go so fast in my life
as that thing went.

1498
01:38:45.643 --> 01:38:49.130
Incredible speed.
Disappeared to nothing.

1499
01:38:49.164 --> 01:38:52.754
And just went. zoom.
straight up so fast.

1500
01:38:52.788 --> 01:38:54.618
It's like it had been
shot out of a gun. Wham!

1501
01:38:54.652 --> 01:38:56.827
Now you see it.
now you don't. It just...

1502
01:38:56.861 --> 01:38:58.518
But it just was. poof!
