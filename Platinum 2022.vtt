209
00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:11.680

Sponge was one of his best soldiers.

1094

The Word ain't like them other dope boys.

1095

He handles shit a little different.

1096

He don't like all that confrontation and retaliation.

1097
00:55:11.621 --> 00:55:14.124
He just confronts and retaliates.

1098
00:55:14.124 --> 00:55:16.460

I'm burning hot.

1587

Do you mind if I get a cold beverage from the fridge?

1588
01:25:51.591 --> 01:25:53.593

1611
01:27:10.837 --> 01:27:13.273
- [Lenny] Hey. hey. only you can make it stop.

1616
01:27:38.898 --> 01:27:40.166
Oh that's nice.

01:27:56.649 --> 01:28:00.086
(crying intensifies)

1622
01:28:00.086 --> 01:28:05.091

1623
01:28:09.662 --> 01:28:10.997
- Get over here.

1624
01:28:12.165 --> 01:28:14.567

01:28:16.202 --> 01:28:17.937
Let's get downstairs.

1626
01:28:20.523 --> 01:28:22.892
- What the fuck are you doing Rico?

1627
01:28:22.892 --> 01:28:25.995
This is stupid. you being real stupid right now.

1628
01:28:28.130 --> 01:28:30.499
I mean no amount of money worth this shit.

1629
01:28:35.738 --> 01:28:39.308
(suspenseful chords build)

1630
01:29:01.731 --> 01:29:03.332
- [Lenny] How'd you get in my safe?

1631
01:29:06.802 --> 01:29:08.904
Put that gun down. put it down.

1632
01:29:10.106 --> 01:29:12.608
Put that down. I'm calling the police.

1633
01:29:13.743 --> 01:29:14.810
- And then what?

1634
01:29:14.810 --> 01:29:16.579
You see the problem here Lenny.

1635
01:29:16.579 --> 01:29:18.614

1636
01:29:21.951 --> 01:29:23.853
(multiple gunshots)

1637
01:29:23.853 --> 01:29:26.188
(loud thud)

1638
01:29:42.304 --> 01:29:45.574
- Come on bestie. let's get this money.

1639
01:29:50.846 --> 01:29:52.848

1640
01:29:55.951 --> 01:29:56.786
Get your bag.

1644
01:30:17.206 --> 01:30:18.274

1645

1650
01:30:26.215 --> 01:30:29.218
- [Rico] Oh shit. - Go. go. go. go...

1651
01:30:53.809 --> 01:30:55.845
(coughs)

1652
01:31:04.153 --> 01:31:07.156
(suspenseful chords)

1653
01:31:30.646 --> 01:31:32.748
(coughs)

1654
01:31:33.649 --> 01:31:34.717
- Hey Mike...

1655
01:31:37.887 --> 01:31:38.788
It's Lenny.

1656
01:31:39.688 --> 01:31:42.525
(coughs)

1657
01:31:42.525 --> 01:31:44.293
I'm gonna need some help.

1658
01:31:44.293 --> 01:31:46.395
(coughs)

1659
01:31:57.339 --> 01:31:58.641
- Is this all of it?

1660
01:31:58.641 --> 01:32:00.776
- There's over half a million in there.

1661
01:32:00.776 --> 01:32:03.445
- Who the fuck told you to count it?

1662
01:32:03.445 --> 01:32:05.648
- What can I say? We were curious.

1663
01:32:05.648 --> 01:32:08.350
It's all there though. now where's our cut?

1664
01:32:08.350 --> 01:32:11.387
- Back seat. $100K a piece.

1665
01:32:12.688 --> 01:32:14.290
And all the dope you can handle.

1666
01:32:17.526 --> 01:32:18.828
(joyful cheer)

1667
01:32:18.828 --> 01:32:21.797
- That's what I'm talking about.

1668
01:32:21.797 --> 01:32:23.465
- Be safe out there Jewel.

1669
01:32:23.465 --> 01:32:25.734
- It's been a pleasure Platinum.

1670
01:32:31.507 --> 01:32:34.944
(fast paced funky music)

1671
01:32:46.155 --> 01:32:48.424
(car horn)

1672
01:32:54.563 --> 01:32:56.732
(whistle)

1673
01:32:57.867 --> 01:32:59.335
- You remember me?

1674
01:33:01.203 --> 01:33:03.639
- Hell yeah. I remember you.

1675
01:33:03.639 --> 01:33:05.674
You the God damn youngster that pimp all the

1676
01:33:05.674 --> 01:33:07.776

1677
01:33:07.776 --> 01:33:10.713
(laughs)

1678
01:33:10.713 --> 01:33:13.215
Yeah. you wanna be like me.

1679
01:33:13.215 --> 01:33:15.818
Let me get a dollar nigga. lemme hold a dollar...

1680
01:33:15.818 --> 01:33:17.953
(visceral rupture)

1681
01:33:17.953 --> 01:33:20.890
(coughing)

1682
01:33:20.890 --> 01:33:24.059
(rupture intensifies)

1683
01:33:32.434 --> 01:33:37.439
- Punk bitch motherfucker.

1684
01:33:41.610 --> 01:33:43.612
Punk bitch motherfucker.

1685
01:33:53.856 --> 01:33:56.959
Punk bitch motherfucker. I'll bet ya next time

1686
01:33:56.959 --> 01:33:59.128
you'll think before you steal a nigga shit.

1687
01:34:26.322 --> 01:34:27.823
- The safe's open.

1688
01:34:37.833 --> 01:34:39.668
- Who did this to you?

1689
01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:46.976
- [Lenny] A couple whores.

1690
01:34:46.976 --> 01:34:47.910
- The safe's empty.

1691
01:34:47.910 --> 01:34:48.777
They set him up.

1692
01:34:49.712 --> 01:34:52.047
- Of course they set him up.

1693
01:34:53.382 --> 01:34:54.783
What's the name of the pimp?

1694
01:34:58.454 --> 01:34:59.321
- [Lenny] No pimp.

1695
01:35:01.256 --> 01:35:02.691
just some whores.

1696
01:35:03.759 --> 01:35:07.096
- Lenny. you're family. and I love you.

1697
01:35:07.096 --> 01:35:09.932
But you've always been somewhat of an idiot.

1698
01:35:11.367 --> 01:35:14.603
A couple of whores. didn't decide to come in here

1699
01:35:14.603 --> 01:35:16.672
and rob you and shoot you.

1700
01:35:17.806 --> 01:35:19.775
If they're hookers. they got a pimp.

1701
01:35:19.775 --> 01:35:23.946
and the pimp told them exactly what to do tonight.

1702
01:35:23.946 --> 01:35:26.715
Come on. give me the pimp's name.

1703
01:35:26.715 --> 01:35:28.984
(coughing)

1704
01:35:46.835 --> 01:35:47.669
- Now what?

1705
01:35:49.104 --> 01:35:52.608
- See these streets out here. they're filled with animals.

1706
01:35:52.608 --> 01:35:54.610
These animals only care about one thing.

1707
01:35:55.511 --> 01:35:56.345
- Money.

1708
01:35:57.346 --> 01:35:58.647
- Show 'em enough money.

1709
01:35:58.647 --> 01:36:00.482
they'll tell us what we need to know.

1710
01:36:21.737 --> 01:36:23.806
- What y'all looking for?

1711
01:36:25.107 --> 01:36:26.341
Aw. come on man.

1712
01:36:26.341 --> 01:36:28.477
I'm not even supposed to be out here tonight.

1713
01:36:32.247 --> 01:36:34.583
(funky music)

1714
01:36:34.833 --> 01:36:36.468
- Platinum. this is Uncle Mike.

1715
01:36:36.468 --> 01:36:38.570
- [Platinum] Who? Do I know you?

1716
01:36:38.570 --> 01:36:40.138
- Last night. no.

1717
01:36:40.138 --> 01:36:43.108
But tonight my existence means everything to you.

1718
01:36:43.108 --> 01:36:44.609
- [Platinum] What you mean?

1719
01:36:44.609 --> 01:36:46.978
- Earlier. you had a couple of your hookers trick my idiot

1720
01:36:46.978 --> 01:36:49.981
nephew into a rendezvous at one of our homes.

1721
01:36:49.981 --> 01:36:52.250
They stole his money and they killed him.

1722
01:36:53.752 --> 01:36:56.755
I could care less about the money or the idiot nephew.

1723
01:36:58.056 --> 01:37:00.759
But you stole something else that belongs to us.

1724
01:37:00.759 --> 01:37:01.960
You stole some jewels that have

1725
01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:03.829
been in our family for centuries.

1726
01:37:03.829 --> 01:37:05.764
- [Platinum] I don't know what you talkin' bout man.

1727
01:37:05.764 --> 01:37:07.366
I ain't got nothing.

1728
01:37:08.934 --> 01:37:11.436
- Well then both of us got bigger problems than we expected.

1729
01:37:11.436 --> 01:37:12.337
- [Platinum] What you mean?

1730
01:37:13.905 --> 01:37:16.408
- I have in my possession a young lady named Silk.

1731
01:37:18.443 --> 01:37:20.846
Meet us at the house where you killed my nephew.

1732
01:37:23.882 --> 01:37:25.550
We don't mean to do her any harm.

1733
01:37:26.718 --> 01:37:28.453
but you have something that belongs to us.

1734
01:37:28.453 --> 01:37:29.287
- [Platinum] Aight...

1735
01:37:29.287 --> 01:37:30.355
- And we want it back.

1736
01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:33.091
- [Platinum] Fuck.

1737
01:37:35.443 --> 01:37:36.978
- So you're just gonna back up into the corner?

1738
01:37:36.978 --> 01:37:38.446
You not even gonna turn around?

1739
01:37:38.446 --> 01:37:41.650
You just gonna watch me the whole entire time?

1740
01:37:41.650 --> 01:37:44.786
- Caesar got stabbed in the back by Brutus. not the chest.

1741
01:37:47.255 --> 01:37:48.757
- So you think I'm just some snake bitch

1742
01:37:48.757 --> 01:37:50.625
that's gonna stab you in your back.

1743
01:37:50.625 --> 01:37:52.761
- I don't know what type of bitch you are.

1744
01:37:52.761 --> 01:37:54.963
I'm just saying if Caesar would've kept his eyes on his

1745
01:37:54.963 --> 01:37:56.431
enemies.

1746
01:37:56.431 --> 01:37:58.500
it wouldn't have been so easy for Brutus to kill him.

1747
01:37:58.500 --> 01:37:59.968
- Yeah. cause Brutus would've had to

1748
01:37:59.968 --> 01:38:03.571
stare his friend in the motherfucking eyes.

1749
01:38:03.571 --> 01:38:04.406
- Exactly.

1750
01:38:06.708 --> 01:38:09.611
- So why'd they call you So Real?

1751
01:38:09.611 --> 01:38:13.048
- It's cause I'm loyal. and when I'm loyal.

1752
01:38:13.048 --> 01:38:14.949
there's nothing to change that.

1753
01:38:14.949 --> 01:38:16.117
- [Ice] Hmm.

1754
01:38:16.117 --> 01:38:17.052
You know The Word's gonna have you

1755
01:38:17.052 --> 01:38:20.121
kill me before the time is up?

1756
01:38:20.121 --> 01:38:22.624
(funky music)

1757
01:38:35.570 --> 01:38:39.007
- Look. I don't have the jewels.

1758
01:38:46.347 --> 01:38:49.050
But if I don't have 'em. I know who does.

1759
01:38:50.285 --> 01:38:51.553
I can get 'em back for you.

1760
01:38:51.553 --> 01:38:52.921
But I'm gonna need my life to do it.

1761
01:38:57.459 --> 01:39:00.061
- Okay. you got one hour.

1762
01:39:01.196 --> 01:39:03.398
We're gonna be following you the whole time.

1763
01:39:06.701 --> 01:39:07.602
- What about her?

1764
01:39:08.536 --> 01:39:10.472
She has nothing to do with this.

1765
01:39:28.757 --> 01:39:32.427
(funky music kicks back in)

1766
01:39:35.130 --> 01:39:36.931
- Did you see the look in his eyes?

1767
01:39:36.931 --> 01:39:38.666
- Yeah. I saw it.

1768
01:39:38.666 --> 01:39:39.801
- They double crossed him

1769
01:39:39.801 --> 01:39:42.504
just like they double crossed Lenny.

1770
01:39:44.305 --> 01:39:46.708
Where are you think they going now?

1771
01:39:46.708 --> 01:39:48.376
- To get our jewels.

1772
01:39:55.950 --> 01:39:58.419
(excited shrieks)

1773
01:39:58.419 --> 01:40:01.589
- Congratulations. you fucking did it.

1774
01:40:09.864 --> 01:40:12.634
(joyous screams)

1775
01:40:47.068 --> 01:40:49.003
- [Rico] That's my cue. - [Jewel] What?

1776
01:40:49.003 --> 01:40:50.338
- [Rico] You know I don't get high no more.

1777
01:40:50.338 --> 01:40:52.173
- Come on. come on. come on Rico.

1778
01:40:52.173 --> 01:40:54.075

1779
01:40:54.075 --> 01:40:56.110
You know you wanna hit this shit.

01:40:58.213 --> 01:40:59.447
Come on. come on.

1783
01:40:59.447 --> 01:41:00.748

1784
01:41:00.748 --> 01:41:02.250
Fuck it. we celebrating. - [Jewel] Yeah. come on.

01:41:02.250 --> 01:41:06.020
I got a line for you baby. I got a line for you.

1786
01:41:17.198 --> 01:41:20.702
Oh shit. oh. - [Rico] That's some good shit

01:41:22.704 --> 01:41:25.240
- [Jewel] Where Kenya?

1788
01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:27.642
- [Rico] I don't know. I need to use the bathroom.

1789
01:41:27.642 --> 01:41:28.643
- All right.

1790
01:41:35.850 --> 01:41:37.585

01:41:49.664 --> 01:41:50.732
- What the fuck?

1793
01:41:50.732 --> 01:41:52.133
- Go get some cold water.

1794
01:41:52.133 --> 01:41:53.768
She's not thirsty. she's OD'n.

1795
01:41:53.768 --> 01:41:56.804
- Go get some cold water please. and hurry up.

1796
01:42:02.977 --> 01:42:06.347
(fast paced funky music)

1797
01:42:14.522 --> 01:42:15.890
- What the fuck are you doing?

1798
01:42:15.890 --> 01:42:17.091
- Is that water cold?

1799
01:42:17.091 --> 01:42:20.028
- Yes. it's about as cold as it's gonna get.

1800
01:42:20.028 --> 01:42:22.063
- Grab Kenya. hold her tight.

1801
01:42:22.063 --> 01:42:25.967
We have to make sure she doesn't go into shock.

1802
01:42:32.206 --> 01:42:35.209
(music intensifies)

1803
01:42:39.647 --> 01:42:41.983
I watched one of my friends in a frat party do this once.

1804
01:42:41.983 --> 01:42:43.651
- [Jewel] Whatever you're gonna do. just hurry the fuck up.

1805
01:42:43.651 --> 01:42:45.253
- Can you stop stressing me please?

1806
01:42:45.253 --> 01:42:46.821
I'm trying to remember this shit.

1807
01:42:46.821 --> 01:42:48.089
Plus I'm high. I don't think

1808
01:42:48.089 --> 01:42:49.157
it'll help the fact I was high. maybe drunk.

1809
01:42:49.157 --> 01:42:50.425
- [Jewel] Whatever you doing.

1810
01:42:50.425 --> 01:42:51.659

1819
01:43:04.505 --> 01:43:05.873
It's gonna be okay.

1820
01:43:05.873 --> 01:43:07.375
It's gonna be okay.

1821
01:43:13.681 --> 01:43:15.650
(electric guitar)

1822
01:43:15.650 --> 01:43:17.752
- I need you to take me to the airport.

1823
01:43:17.752 --> 01:43:19.754
I need you to take me to the airport.

1824
01:43:20.004 --> 01:43:21.372

1825
01:43:21.372 --> 01:43:22.873
- Platinum got some shit going on.

1826
01:43:22.873 --> 01:43:24.442
I need you to take me to the airport.

1827
01:43:24.442 --> 01:43:25.676

I'll protect you.

1832
01:43:35.253 --> 01:43:37.121

01:43:51.869 --> 01:43:54.138
Don't come out unless I tell you otherwise.

1839
01:43:54.138 --> 01:43:55.806
You understand me bitch?

1840
01:43:55.806 --> 01:43:56.741

1841
01:43:56.741 --> 01:43:58.676

(fast paced funky music)

1846
01:44:56.350 --> 01:44:58.018
- [Platinum] You bitches lucky I ain't got time

1847
01:44:58.018 --> 01:44:59.253
to fuck around today.

1848
01:45:02.590 --> 01:45:03.824

1850
01:45:05.059 --> 01:45:09.029
- Now? They still got a couple hours left.

1851
01:45:09.029 --> 01:45:11.432
- I know. you think that motherfucker

1853
01:45:13.867 --> 01:45:16.003
I don't give a damn how much time I gave him.

1854
01:45:18.505 --> 01:45:20.307
Yeah... - [Platinum] I'm on my way.

1855
01:45:22.776 --> 01:45:25.579
She better be in perfect condition when I... (call cuts)

1856
01:45:25.579 --> 01:45:26.714
- Was that him?

1857
01:45:26.714 --> 01:45:27.514
- [The Word] Does it matter?

1858
01:45:27.514 --> 01:45:29.016
- Hell yeah. it matters.

1859
01:45:29.016 --> 01:45:30.250
It's the difference between me

1860
01:45:30.250 --> 01:45:32.086
killing a woman and. and letting her live.

1861
01:45:32.086 --> 01:45:34.321
- You really thought she was gonna live?

1862
01:45:34.321 --> 01:45:36.357
That motherfucker killed Sponge.

1863
01:45:36.357 --> 01:45:37.625
and that girl was like a son to me.

1864
01:45:37.625 --> 01:45:39.660
So I don't give a damn if he bring back a

1865
01:45:39.660 --> 01:45:41.128
Brinks truck with him.

1866
01:45:41.128 --> 01:45:43.464
Him and her are dying today.

1867

1868
01:46:00.147 --> 01:46:02.916
He wants you to take a. a bath...

- Yeah. I had to get it how I can get it.

1885
01:46:54.168 --> 01:46:55.836
but it's up to you to protect it.

1886
01:46:55.836 --> 01:46:57.237
Now where's my wife?

1887
01:46:57.237 --> 01:47:01.675

He not like you.

1890
01:47:18.692 --> 01:47:21.295
You don't really wanna kill me.

1891
01:47:32.106 --> 01:47:33.273
(gunshot)

1892
01:47:33.273 --> 01:47:34.374
(fast paced funky music)

1893
01:47:34.374 --> 01:47:39.379
Ice. Ice. Ice. (screaming)

1894
01:47:39.847 --> 01:47:40.614
Ice...

1895
01:48:01.168 --> 01:48:04.505
(flesh getting pierced)

1896
01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:09.009
(choking gargles)

1897
01:48:29.997 --> 01:48:33.433
(slow suspenseful music)

1898
01:48:41.508 --> 01:48:44.745
(heart wrenching wail)

1899
01:49:11.338 --> 01:49:14.007
(warning beeps)

1900
01:49:25.385 --> 01:49:28.322
(crying continues)

1901
01:49:44.471 --> 01:49:46.573
- I was coming to get you baby.

1902
01:49:46.573 --> 01:49:48.375
I was coming...

1903
01:49:48.375 --> 01:49:50.544
I was trying to get to you

1904
01:49:52.012 --> 01:49:54.748
(louder sobbing)

1905
01:50:05.025 --> 01:50:06.426
Don't leave me...

1906
01:50:12.933 --> 01:50:15.269
How could you do this to me?

1907
01:50:33.787 --> 01:50:37.391
(eerie suspenseful chords)

1908
01:51:06.954 --> 01:51:09.189

1909
01:51:11.959 --> 01:51:14.962

1910
01:51:18.432 --> 01:51:21.335
(chords intensify)

1911
01:51:31.645 --> 01:51:32.546

- Get the bag.

1917
01:53:11.044 --> 01:53:13.480

I brought 'em the money.

1919
01:53:16.783 --> 01:53:18.585
- They killed her anyway?

1920
01:53:19.786 --> 01:53:22.389
The fucking dog's got no honor.

1921
01:53:22.389 --> 01:53:24.091
- [Platinum] Your jewels is in there too.

1922
01:53:26.026 --> 01:53:27.494
We good?

1923
01:53:27.494 --> 01:53:30.363
- What happened to the whores. did you kill 'em?

1924
01:53:30.363 --> 01:53:32.532
- You don't have to worry about seeing them again.

1925
01:53:33.633 --> 01:53:35.001
- Good. let's go.

1926
01:53:35.936 --> 01:53:36.770
- What about him?

1927
01:53:38.405 --> 01:53:39.606
- He's lost enough.

1928
01:53:43.376 --> 01:53:46.046
(melodic beeps)

1929
01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:01.862
- It's play time fellas.

1930
01:54:08.034 --> 01:54:09.369

01:54:15.142 --> 01:54:17.144
(click)

1932
01:54:26.119 --> 01:54:27.621
Platinum's home...
