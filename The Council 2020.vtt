00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.790
We just wanted to ask you a few questions.

182
00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:36.030
I mean the other witness there

183
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.200
said it was a white guy. too.

184
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.713
- Messiah. Messiah you all right?

185
00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.430
You didn't talk to the
media or anything. right?

186
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:45.760
- I'm sorry.

187
00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.390
And you are?

188
00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:48.500
- I'm Michael Douglass III.

189
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.900
I represent this heroic gentlemen.

190
00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:50.733
And you are?

191
00:09:50.733 --> 00:09:52.960
- Detective Griffin. LAPD.

192
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.880
- Okay. well is my client a suspect?

193
00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.150
- No.

194
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:57.510
- Exactly. so I'm trying to figure out

195
00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:59.000
why is he being questioned?

196
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.420
- And how do you know
we're questioning him?

197
00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.390
- Well. I know you're not here

198
00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:05.217
to simply thank him for
putting his life on the line.

199
00:10:05.217 --> 00:10:07.370
Now my job is to protect
the wellbeing of my client

200
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.100
and make sure he doesn't
answer any questions

201
00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.704
or be interviewed by anybody.

202
00:10:10.704 --> 00:10:12.490
especially knowing that the killer

203
00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:14.230
is out there on the loose.

204
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:15.970
- We're just doing our job.

205
00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:17.700
- And I am trying to do mine.

206
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:18.573
Now do you mind?

207
00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:24.650
- If you can remember anything else

208
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.300
that might help us find who
did this. give me a call.

209
00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.210
Good day. gentlemen.

210
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.220
- We need to get up out of here.

211
00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.070
You understand what I'm saying?

212
00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:41.070
- Yeah. black dress shit.
black pants. black shoes.

213
00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:42.757
- What about him?

214
00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:45.270
He owe us a bill?

215
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:46.223
- Yeah.

216
00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:48.780
- I'm on it.

217
00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.983
Come on. let's get up out of here.

218
00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.663
- [Interviewer] So you were the muscle.

219
00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:58.543
- I'm a lawyer.

220
00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:02.480
Listen. where I come from

221
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.270
chaos was the law of nature.

222
00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:10.269
I take it as though you don't
know anything about that.

223
00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:12.860
(laughing)

224
00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:14.523
Order was the dream of us.

225
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:16.440
We can't expect

226
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.110
for people to have any
respect for law and order

227
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:21.380
until we teach those we have entrusted

228
00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.363
to enforce those laws.

229
00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:26.730
- [Interviewer] Is that so?

230
00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:27.803
- Order is power.

231
00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:32.623
With such power comes
great responsibilities.

232
00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:36.860
Mr. Dupree.

233
00:11:38.799 --> 00:11:41.049
- [Dupree] What's going on?

234
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:44.633
- Have a seat. man.

235
00:11:46.199 --> 00:11:48.663
- No. but I'mma get straight to it.

236
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:51.540
The organization I represent.

237
00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.493
we trying to clean up
the community. Dupree.

238
00:11:54.395 --> 00:11:56.338
- What the fuck that
gotta do with me. man?

239
00:11:56.338 --> 00:11:59.460
- We need you to stop
serving in the community.

240
00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.443
- Man. I'm not about to stop serving shit.

241
00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:05.206
I feel highly disrespected

242
00:12:05.206 --> 00:12:07.835
that you even think you
got the balls enough

243
00:12:07.835 --> 00:12:09.789
to come to my office talking like that.

244
00:12:09.789 --> 00:12:10.622
- And that's your word?

245
00:12:10.622 --> 00:12:12.190
- Yeah. that's my motherfucking word.

246
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.690
- Feelings. man. get
outta your feelings. man.

247
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:16.350
It's nothing personal.

248
00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:18.040
It's for the betterment of the community.

249
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.473
- Nah. fuck the community.

250
00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:23.220
Fuck the organization
and fuck you too. man.

251
00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.320
Now you run and tell Messiah

252
00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.610
I said I'm not stop serving shit.

253
00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:28.750
Get the fuck up out of my office.

254
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.260
- Okay. Dupree.

255
00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.074
We'll keep in touch. brother.

256
00:12:32.074 --> 00:12:33.614
- No. you ain't about
to touch shit either.

257
00:12:33.614 --> 00:12:35.460
Get the fuck up outta here. man.

258
00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:36.860
You hear this mother fucker?

259
00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.080
- It's not only a black thing.

260
00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.510
It's a Latino thing as well.

261
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:42.603
Chanel. get off your phone.

262
00:12:42.603 --> 00:12:46.913
If you're a minority in this
world. determines for you.

263
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.240
History reflects our present

264
00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.623
and our present determines our future.

265
00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:54.813
Go ahead Robert.

266
00:12:54.813 --> 00:12:58.070
- Mr. Messiah. so why is
history repeating itself

267
00:12:58.070 --> 00:12:59.710
when it comes to oppression?

268
00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:00.960
We don't have a choice.

269
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.170
- Yes we do. we certainly have a choice.

270
00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:05.180
History only repeats itself

271
00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.543
if we allow it to.

272
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:09.460
See everybody in this room.

273
00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.600
y'all have the power to change the world.

274
00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.900
- [Male] You sound like a fitness coach.

275
00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:17.070
- Look guys. stop laughing. I'm serious.

276
00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:18.740
Look at it like this.

277
00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.130
our oppressors created a formula

278
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.780
to make us think and believe

279
00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:27.300
we don't have the power to
change the world and we do.

280
00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.493
The power is in you.

281
00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:30.913
Go ahead. Marcus.

282
00:13:30.913 --> 00:13:31.850
- I don't see how though.

283
00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:33.180
Like we born monsters

284
00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.890
in a society that don't want us to win.

285
00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:38.610
- Stand up and say that
one more time to the class.

286
00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.080
- I mean. I feel like
we born in society yet

287
00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.563
that want us to fail.

288
00:13:44.039 --> 00:13:46.503
- That's what they want us to believe.

289
00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.853
And we're not born monsters.

290
00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:57.020
Circumstances. poverty and pain
turns us into that monster.

291
00:14:02.284 --> 00:14:03.990
(bell ringing)

292
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:05.237
Class dismissed.

293
00:14:09.341 --> 00:14:14.341
(heavy breathing)
(ominous music)

294
00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:19.512
- Bam. bam. in yo face.

295
00:14:19.512 --> 00:14:20.901
(laughing)

296
00:14:20.901 --> 00:14:22.620
You know you can never be faster

297
00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:25.610
than your big sis. little bro.

298
00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:26.530
- I know that now.

299
00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:27.978
- You want to go again?

300
00:14:27.978 --> 00:14:30.070
- No. show me that card
trick you be doing.

301
00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.290
- Why. so you can show
your little girlfriend?

302
00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:34.348
- Ah come on. I ain't gonna
be showing nobody nothing.

303
00:14:34.348 --> 00:14:36.950
- Mmhmm. I know you be trying
to impress them little girls.

304
00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:38.770
- Yeah whatever. come on. just show me.

305
00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:40.130
- All right. all right. all right.

306
00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:41.533
Okay. so pick a card.

307
00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:44.070
All right. you got it?

308
00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:45.546
- Yeah.

309
00:14:45.546 --> 00:14:47.210
- Okay. put it back.

310
00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:49.213
Boy. I ain't trying to look at your card.

311
00:14:49.213 --> 00:14:50.046
- [Tony] Got to be sure.

312
00:14:53.046 --> 00:14:54.646
- All right. you ready?
- Yeah.

313
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:58.030
- Bam. is that your card?

314
00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.646
- Just like that.
(pounding on door)

315
00:14:59.646 --> 00:15:01.979
Hold on. I'll be right back.

316
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.585
- God damn. girl. it took
your ass long enough.

317
00:15:08.585 --> 00:15:10.790
- Well hello.
- Shit. make me a drink.

318
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:11.690
Hey little nigger.

319
00:15:12.585 --> 00:15:14.635
Go to the store and get me an eight ball.

320
00:15:16.252 --> 00:15:21.252
Hey. hey. make sure you bring
my change back. your ass.

321
00:15:29.574 --> 00:15:32.324
(dramatic music)

322
00:15:37.245 --> 00:15:39.912
(phone buzzing)

323
00:15:42.514 --> 00:15:43.760
- [Messiah] Hey. what's
happening. Council?

324
00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:44.804
I'm 'bout to pull up right now.

325
00:15:44.804 --> 00:15:45.887
- All right.

326
00:15:51.787 --> 00:15:54.204
(cool music)

327
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:17.830
- An undercover cop. Khalid?

328
00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:21.720
In front of his children?

329
00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.310
- The same way he murdered
Christopher Walker

330
00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:24.950
in front of his family and children.

331
00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:26.803
but I don't see you too
concerned about that. now do I?

332
00:16:27.894 --> 00:16:30.077
- You know. you can't keep this up right?

333
00:16:30.077 --> 00:16:32.783
This whole. I take the
law into my own hands?

334
00:16:34.977 --> 00:16:38.500
"If my people who are called by my name

335
00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.914
will humble themselves.
pray and seek my face-"

336
00:16:41.914 --> 00:16:44.175
- "Put on the armor of God

337
00:16:44.175 --> 00:16:47.279
so that you may take a stand
against the devil's scheme.

338
00:16:47.279 --> 00:16:49.700
for our struggle is not
against flesh and blood.

339
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.560
but against the rulers and authorities

340
00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.260
in the powers in this dark world."

341
00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:57.390
Don't play that game with me. Mark.

342
00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:59.640
I know the same Bible you know.

343
00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:00.920
- So when is enough enough?

344
00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.840
- Enough is enough when y'all
stop playing these people.

345
00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.790
when all your segregated
pastors come together

346
00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:07.400
and really do for the community.

347
00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.260
Don't get mad. man

348
00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.480
'cause I'm just doing
what y'all afraid to do.

349
00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.202
Stop preaching that bullshit-

350
00:17:12.202 --> 00:17:13.478
- Don't cuss in this church.

351
00:17:13.478 --> 00:17:15.970
You off all people know.

352
00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:17.330
don't get confused and think

353
00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:19.250
because they afraid of you out there

354
00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:20.950
that I'm afraid of you up in here.

355
00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:26.039
- I just so happened to be
in the neighborhood. man.

356
00:17:26.039 --> 00:17:26.872
just wanted to check on you.

357
00:17:26.872 --> 00:17:28.823
make sure you was good. that's all. man.

358
00:17:30.326 --> 00:17:32.077
I think one of your members here. man.

359
00:17:32.077 --> 00:17:33.477
you can pray for her though.

360
00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:39.593
- Celeste?

361
00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.850
Celeste. what's going on?

362
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:46.773
- Pastor. I'm sorry to bother you.

363
00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:48.520
- What's going on?

364
00:17:50.873 --> 00:17:52.273
- Oh my God.

365
00:17:54.922 --> 00:17:58.277
Come on. come on. come on.
have a seat. have a seat.

366
00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:02.170
Celeste. what's going on?

367
00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:03.003
Talk to me.

368
00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:09.940
- Calvin. I mean. my ex-boyfriend.

369
00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.550
well. we got into a really bad argument

370
00:18:14.405 --> 00:18:16.500
and he stabbed me

371
00:18:17.357 --> 00:18:19.490
and he pistol whipped me.

372
00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:20.960
- Did you tell the police?

373
00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:24.253
- I did. but they wasn't
trying to help me.

374
00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:27.600
They was in the station laughing at me

375
00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.573
and one asked me how much for a quickie?

376
00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:34.990
- This dude you're
talking about. he a pimp?

377
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:37.543
- Yeah.

378
00:18:39.664 --> 00:18:41.190
- What you know about a dude

379
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:44.380
named Calvin over there
pimping off Western?

380
00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:47.370
- She talking about Tiny
Mouse and Six Deuce.

381
00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:48.460
I went to school with him.

382
00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:50.660
Pierre might know a little more though.

383
00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:52.143
- Let's go see Pierre. then.

384
00:18:55.527 --> 00:18:57.777
- Khalid. bruh. don't man.

385
00:19:00.317 --> 00:19:02.703
Me and you both know how this ends.

386
00:19:02.703 --> 00:19:05.133
- Yeah. we damn sure do know
how it ends. it ends here.

387
00:19:05.133 --> 00:19:07.280
Because if we don't protect
our people and land.

388
00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.113
who else will?

389
00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.810
'Cause it damn sure ain't the church.

390
00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:22.153
- Messiah.

391
00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.023
I want to talk to you about something.

392
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:38.143
I know about what it is you guys do.

393
00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.093
the Council.

394
00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:46.690
I know about Ron Chaney. the drug dealers.

395
00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:47.660
I even know what it is

396
00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.620
you really teaching up
in this history class

397
00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.653
and how you the mind of the community.

398
00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.940
But using Lucren as a distraction. mmm.

399
00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.053
now you see this that's
some gangster shit.

400
00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.060
- How much you want. huh?

401
00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:07.460
- I don't want your money.

402
00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.230
- Then what is it you want. sister?

403
00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.393
- I was there.

404
00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.300
I was there the night the police

405
00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.313
shot and killed Christopher Walker.

406
00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.107
I seen the police officer who did it

407
00:20:21.107 --> 00:20:24.460
and I watched them taunt. laugh

408
00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:27.185
and treat us like we ain't shit.

409
00:20:27.185 --> 00:20:29.882
- So what is it you want?

410
00:20:29.882 --> 00:20:31.750
You want revenge?

411
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:33.423
- I want in.

412
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:36.900
Whoever pursues righteousness and love

413
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.253
finds life and prosperity.

414
00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:41.760
- Do you feel like what
we're doing right now

415
00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.763
and how we operate is righteousness?

416
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:48.850
- Yes.

417
00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:49.683
- Why?

418
00:20:50.994 --> 00:20:52.943
- Because it's a necessary.

419
00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:05.790
- Can I ask you something. comrade?

420
00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:06.623
- Yeah.

421
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.350
- Do you believe in the absence of hope?

422
00:21:14.802 --> 00:21:17.363
- Only when the belief
for hope isn't present.

423
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:22.343
- And do you believe we that hope?

424
00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:26.453
- Do you?

425
00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:29.783
Let's move.

426
00:21:34.603 --> 00:21:35.510
- [Interviewer] You know.

427
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:39.000
for a seemingly intelligent
self-educated person.

428
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.713
you really don't say much. do you?

429
00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:45.157
- Nah. that's very observant.

430
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:47.510
The quiet one in the room

431
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:49.423
make more noise than a motor mouse.

432
00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:54.233
And plus. just ain't
got much to say to you.

433
00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:57.210
- [Male] Let's get to it then.

434
00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:59.450
How'd you become involved
with the Council?

435
00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:00.520
- Now y'all know I ain't finna had y'all

436
00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.640
come down here to my spot for no bullshit.

437
00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.720
I know what y'all trying to get going.

438
00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.117
I figure I turned y'all on

439
00:22:05.117 --> 00:22:06.270
to one of the little homies from the hood.

440
00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:08.580
- He used to be super
turnt up and banged out.

441
00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.288
and now he finna get put
off the hood. though.

442
00:22:11.288 --> 00:22:13.621
(crosstalk)

443
00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:16.486
What is y'all waiting on?

444
00:22:16.486 --> 00:22:17.636
Get that little nigger.

445
00:22:18.616 --> 00:22:20.866
(grunting)

446
00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:25.117
- So what you think?

447
00:22:25.117 --> 00:22:27.450
(grunting)

448
00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:37.140
- [Messiah] Papa Rugazzi.

449
00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:39.950
- Hey Messiah. there he is.

450
00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:42.420
My boy. come over here.

451
00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:43.544
How you doin'?

452
00:22:43.544 --> 00:22:45.182
- [Messiah] All right. good to see you.

453
00:22:45.182 --> 00:22:46.550
- Good. have a seat.

454
00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:49.138
- Serge. como estas?

455
00:22:49.138 --> 00:22:50.339
- Bien. bien. y ustead?

456
00:22:50.339 --> 00:22:51.756
- Estoy muy bien.

457
00:22:53.056 --> 00:22:57.486
- So tell me Messiah. how's business?

458
00:22:57.486 --> 00:23:00.290
- Business is well.

459
00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:01.840
Everything's going good so far.

460
00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:04.393
- No problems?

461
00:23:05.836 --> 00:23:08.640
- Not at all. nothing I can't handle.

462
00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:12.121
I just basically wanted
to set this meeting up

463
00:23:12.121 --> 00:23:13.593
to ask you guys something.

464
00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:20.183
Longevity. how do we maintain longevity

465
00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:22.720
in this field of work?

466
00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.010
- To maintain longevity. Messiah.

467
00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:27.060
you have to have alliances.

468
00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.963
But they have to be good
alliances from the right people.

469
00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:34.200
- How do you know who to trust.

470
00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.860
who's fake. who's real?

471
00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:38.160
New and old clients.
in and out. in and out.

472
00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.033
How do we know who the right people are?

473
00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:44.640
- Are you a religious man?

474
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.823
Do believe in God?

475
00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:49.270
- Yes.

476
00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:50.813
- The spirit of discernment.

477
00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:57.020
Longevity comes with great
wisdom and acceptance.

478
00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:00.340
You have to accept that
you're not gonna live forever.

479
00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:05.620
You have to accept that the
show won't go on forever.

480
00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:10.040
Every second. every minute.
every hour. every day.

481
00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.693
everything counts.

482
00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:15.050
- You see the problem.
Messiah. with the blacks.

483
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:20.240
they're too flashy. they're big braggers.

484
00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.940
They love to be in that spotlight.

485
00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:25.580
But the problem is that
spotlight draws attention

486
00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:29.530
and attention is bad for business.

487
00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:30.430
Do you understand?

488
00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:37.500
- An off duty cop. too much
attention. too much noise.

489
00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.720
Sure. you may have
whacked off some bad cop.

490
00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.410
How is that changing your community?

491
00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:48.200
- Messiah. you want to
restore the community.

492
00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:52.910
you have to restore order and
instill fear in the people.

493
00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:54.223
- See. I don't know about that.

494
00:24:55.188 --> 00:24:57.193
Does it have to be that deep?

495
00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.210
For instance. what if I'd rather be loved

496
00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:02.510
than feared by the people?

497
00:25:03.779 --> 00:25:04.612
(laughing)

498
00:25:04.612 --> 00:25:05.903
- Love. love?

499
00:25:07.951 --> 00:25:09.223
I can't believe it. love?

500
00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:11.510
Let me tell you something.

501
00:25:12.628 --> 00:25:14.983
Love got Dr. King killed.

502
00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:17.833
What did it do for Malcolm X?

503
00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:20.553
Even your father was loved.

504
00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:22.990
And what happened to them?

505
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:26.020
Let me set the record straight.

506
00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:29.953
love in this business will get you killed.

507
00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:32.370
You want to stop those punks

508
00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:34.360
from running around in your community?

509
00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.801
You have to set an example.

510
00:25:36.801 --> 00:25:38.763
You have to draw a line.

511
00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:43.153
When they see that line
and if they cross it.

512
00:25:43.153 --> 00:25:44.703
there will be hell to pay.

513
00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.003
They must know that.

514
00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.033
And if they're not afraid of hell.

515
00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:55.420
they'll send (speaking
in foreign language)

516
00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:00.523
keep your friends close
but your enemies closer.

517
00:26:01.494 --> 00:26:02.793
Entiendes?

518
00:26:04.129 --> 00:26:05.046
- Entiendo.

519
00:26:06.926 --> 00:26:07.759
(audience applause)

520
00:26:07.759 --> 00:26:09.120
- When we talk about
reaching out to the community

521
00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:10.280
and touching the people.

522
00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:13.523
we have to be hands on.
and I mean hands on.

523
00:26:15.081 --> 00:26:17.620
The reason why the system
doesn't care about the people

524
00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:20.033
is because we don't care about the people.

525
00:26:22.246 --> 00:26:24.130
Our history is a reflection of the present

526
00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:25.863
and a preview of the future.

527
00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:29.963
When we lost the head
of the family. we lost.

528
00:26:29.963 --> 00:26:33.010
(cheering)

529
00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:34.033
but hold on now.

530
00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.760
just as they enslaved
and exploited our worth

531
00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.670
during the old days of slavery.

532
00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:44.440
they will continue to
enslave and exploit our worth

533
00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.794
unless we make a change.

534
00:26:46.794 --> 00:26:49.044
(cheering)

535
00:26:55.017 --> 00:26:56.790
How did I do?

536
00:26:56.790 --> 00:27:00.790
- I gotta be honest with
you. man. you did well.

537
00:27:02.078 --> 00:27:03.978
Like for real. you killed it up there.

538
00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:07.720
The whole time I was watching
you take over the stage.

539
00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:10.640
I'm just like how does he
retain so much information

540
00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:12.817
and remember it so well?

541
00:27:12.817 --> 00:27:16.390
What you displayed. that's
how you take over a room.

542
00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:21.240
- Hey man. majoring in
criminal justice and philosophy

543
00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.350
will help you memorize anything.

544
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:25.050
Plus I learned from the best. huh?

545
00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:28.653
- Nah. Lucren. you got it my brother.

546
00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:33.973
See. all you need to do now
is keep seeking knowledge.

547
00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:36.530
Check this out.

548
00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:38.140
Someone wise man once told me

549
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.110
a disciple is one who seeks knowledge.

550
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:47.143
an apostle is someone who
applies that knowledge.

551
00:27:48.562 --> 00:27:50.120
- What made you so passionate

552
00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.370
about bringing about
change in the community?

553
00:27:54.096 --> 00:27:56.193
- Man. I look at it like this.

554
00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:00.350
if our oppressors went through
so much of a great deal

555
00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:06.300
to create this master plan
so our people won't progress.

556
00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:10.190
what is it about us that
scares them so much?

557
00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:11.163
- Exactly.

558
00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:13.043
- See my brother.

559
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:16.127
I'm gonna find that key

560
00:28:16.127 --> 00:28:19.830
and I'm gonna unlock and
crack every code to it.

561
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:21.770
- That's what I'm saying. my brother.

562
00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:23.170
We can crack the code together

563
00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:25.620
and turn some serious shit around.

564
00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:26.640
That's why I wish you would come up here

565
00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:27.570
and speak with me. man.

566
00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:30.093
- Nah. that's not my thing.

567
00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:32.723
Maybe one day. but not right now.

568
00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:35.383
- If you say so. man. if you say so.

569
00:28:37.772 --> 00:28:41.250
- But look man. I do have
to prepare for class.

570
00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:45.010
So you know. I had to come
and check you out. man.

571
00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:46.646
Everything you're doing is growing.

572
00:28:46.646 --> 00:28:47.857
- I appreciate it.
- I appreciate it. brother.

573
00:28:47.857 --> 00:28:50.790
- You gonna come help me
prep for the next meeting?

574
00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:52.700
- Yeah. definitely. just let me know.

575
00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:53.976
- Looking forward to it.

576
00:28:53.976 --> 00:28:54.809
- Alright brother. I'll see you.

577
00:28:54.809 --> 00:28:55.642
- Take care.

578
00:28:55.642 --> 00:28:56.475
- Keep doing your thing.

579
00:29:21.347 --> 00:29:23.618
- Oh hey. hey. hey. hey. relax.

580
00:29:23.618 --> 00:29:25.486
- Slow and easy.

581
00:29:25.486 --> 00:29:26.653
Slow and easy.

582
00:29:27.694 --> 00:29:29.635
Let's get this shit over with.

583
00:29:29.635 --> 00:29:30.914
Get it the fuck over with.

584
00:29:30.914 --> 00:29:31.747
- Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa hold on.

585
00:29:31.747 --> 00:29:32.880
I didn't do anything wrong. okay?

586
00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.729
I don't know what you guys think I did

587
00:29:34.729 --> 00:29:35.812
but I didn't.

588
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:40.810
What the hell do you guys want?

589
00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:41.643
- Answers.

590
00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:44.250
It's been a while since the incident

591
00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:46.603
and you still haven't
went to the police yet.

592
00:29:49.705 --> 00:29:51.090
- Wait a second.

593
00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:53.350
Wait. wait. I saw you
down at the crime scene

594
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:56.156
talking to the guy who tried to stop him.

595
00:29:56.156 --> 00:29:58.640
What the hell is going on here?

596
00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.040
- Something bigger than you.

597
00:30:00.899 --> 00:30:03.930
And I'm gonna ask you one last time.

598
00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:05.530
why haven't you went to the police

599
00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:08.130
and why did you tell them
that the killer was white?

600
00:30:09.028 --> 00:30:10.380
- Because the police are just as crooked

601
00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:12.520
as the criminals on the street.

602
00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.876
And to be honest with you.

603
00:30:13.876 --> 00:30:16.370
that son of a bitch got
exactly what he deserved.

604
00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:17.270
- I beg your pardon?

605
00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:20.363
- Officer Chaney. he raped me.

606
00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:25.120
He was as guilty as
anybody he ever locked up.

607
00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.470
- So what were you doing down there?

608
00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:29.319
- I was investigating.

609
00:30:29.319 --> 00:30:30.840
I'm a reporter. I work-

610
00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.095
- Fuck this. man.

611
00:30:32.095 --> 00:30:33.675
He know too fucking much. man.

612
00:30:33.675 --> 00:30:35.350
He know too much man.

613
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:36.550
- Take it easy. all right?

614
00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:38.400
Look. I don't know why you
killed him and I don't care.

615
00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.820
All right. the truth is I
was looking into him myself

616
00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:42.090
to put him away.

617
00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:44.820
Even if I did come forward
with all the dirt I had on him.

618
00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:46.020
it would only made me a target.

619
00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:48.062
I'd probably be dead too.

620
00:30:48.062 --> 00:30:50.994
- So why didn't you identify the shooter?

621
00:30:50.994 --> 00:30:52.790
- 'Cause I know he had good reason

622
00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:54.910
for killing that piece of shit.

623
00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:58.750
'Cause if he didn't. any
CI could identify him.

624
00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:00.150
he would have killed me too.

625
00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:02.653
- Hold up.

626
00:31:07.316 --> 00:31:10.066
I saved you this time. Tommy boy.

627
00:31:12.044 --> 00:31:13.793
- Who in the hell are you guys?

628
00:31:14.757 --> 00:31:16.923
- Just a few good Samaritans

629
00:31:16.923 --> 00:31:19.380
attempting to clean up our community.

630
00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:21.460
- Okay. maybe I can help you.

631
00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:23.260
- We don't need your fucking help.

632
00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:24.980
- Just listen to me. all right?

633
00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:26.110
I've got information.

634
00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:26.970
I've got resources.

635
00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:28.350
I've got leads.

636
00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:30.200
I spent my entire career

637
00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.403
looking into the corruption of the city.

638
00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.273
All right. just give you a chance

639
00:31:34.273 --> 00:31:36.500
to show you what I've put together. okay?

640
00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:39.030
- Okay. get to it.

641
00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:39.863
- All right.

642
00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:43.477
- Slow and easy. God damn it.

643
00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:52.570
- Wow. you got enough information here

644
00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:54.370
to take down the whole police force.

645
00:31:55.428 --> 00:31:56.261
I'm not understanding.

646
00:31:56.261 --> 00:31:57.893
Why not turn this in?

647
00:31:57.893 --> 00:31:59.083
- Turn it in to who?

648
00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:03.380
Besides even with half
these guys off the street.

649
00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:05.530
your community is still
overrun with crime.

650
00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:09.490
My goal here is to
eliminate it permanently.

651
00:32:10.635 --> 00:32:12.313
- That's a big goal.

652
00:32:13.699 --> 00:32:15.093
- Yeah. it is.

653
00:32:18.895 --> 00:32:22.145
- I tell you what. we'll keep in touch.

654
00:32:23.009 --> 00:32:24.450
- Well wait. hey.

655
00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:26.340
let me at least show you what I've got on-

656
00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:28.130
- Must be a dangerous
job being a reporter.

657
00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:29.670
You got to take this
piece of shit with you

658
00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:30.793
to empty your trash.

659
00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:34.670
- [Tommy] Yeah. it's a
dangerous neighborhood.

660
00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:36.770
I'm sure you know that better than anyone.

661
00:32:38.889 --> 00:32:41.307
- I do. smart ass.

662
00:32:45.221 --> 00:32:48.054
(dramatic music)

663
00:32:49.875 --> 00:32:52.600
- Brothers. brothers. brothers.

664
00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.893
big. big business to tackle and handle.

665
00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:58.720
Hey Mike. you take care of
that bill from the situation?

666
00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.670
- Yeah and no.

667
00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:01.503
- What's that mean?

668
00:33:01.503 --> 00:33:03.230
- That situation is interesting.

669
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:05.722
It might be something
you want to look into.

670
00:33:05.722 --> 00:33:07.710
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

671
00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:08.543
- How you feel?

672
00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:11.593
- I really don't trust his white ass

673
00:33:11.593 --> 00:33:14.343
but I I mean. hey. we'll see.

674
00:33:15.446 --> 00:33:16.896
I'll say check it out though.

675
00:33:17.915 --> 00:33:19.600
There's this nigger named Tiny Mouse

676
00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.739
over there pimping off Western.

677
00:33:21.739 --> 00:33:24.500
female came into church the other day.

678
00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.390
pistol whipped the shit out of her.

679
00:33:27.336 --> 00:33:30.624
- So how do you want to deal with it?

680
00:33:30.624 --> 00:33:32.660
- To eradicate the wild behavior.

681
00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:36.310
The slaves back in the early 1900's.

682
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:39.170
the slave masters would mortify
the primarily killer slaves

683
00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:40.003
in front of everybody

684
00:33:40.003 --> 00:33:41.100
to install fear in them.

685
00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:44.330
You want to eradicate something?

686
00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:46.310
Mortify it in front of the mimics

687
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:48.060
and the mimics gonna vanish.

688
00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:50.040
- That shit sound like my
type of work right there.

689
00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.254
- [Male] Yeah but look.

690
00:33:51.254 --> 00:33:52.680
that would be a huge risk we take.

691
00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:56.890
- The key is to be organized. not sloppy.

692
00:33:56.890 --> 00:33:59.360
calculated. not predictable.

693
00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:02.453
We see and know what's coming. they don't.

694
00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:06.523
And the element of surprise.

695
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:09.590
it's one of the key arts of war.

696
00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.350
- So what about Dupree?

697
00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:17.200
- Dupree's having a
little '80s party tonight.

698
00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.073
So. I made some plans.

699
00:34:19.995 --> 00:34:23.003
Thought we'd just stopped
by for a little second.

700
00:34:23.003 --> 00:34:24.420
- '80s. huh?

701
00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:25.983
I need a new hairstyle anyway.

702
00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:29.570
Hey doc. you know how to pop lock?

703
00:34:30.444 --> 00:34:32.777
(hip music)

704
00:35:07.086 --> 00:35:08.683
- [Celeste] Want to be
my candy man. sexy daddy?

705
00:35:09.984 --> 00:35:12.317
(hip music)

706
00:35:45.592 --> 00:35:46.631
- [Male] Let's have a toast.

707
00:35:46.631 --> 00:35:48.964
(hip music)

708
00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:57.503
- Yeah. and what the fuck you want?

709
00:35:57.503 --> 00:35:59.740
- [Male] I want to see Dupree. man.

710
00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:00.830
- Yeah. and?

711
00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:02.440
Make a mother fucking appointment.

712
00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:03.860
(gunfire blasting)

713
00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:04.693
Ah shit. fuck!

714
00:36:04.693 --> 00:36:07.131
They shot me in my shin.

715
00:36:07.131 --> 00:36:08.566
Dupree!

716
00:36:08.566 --> 00:36:10.080
- [Male] That shit you was
talking the other day. Dupree.

717
00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:12.880
- Man. who in the fuck do
y'all think that you are. man?

718
00:36:14.188 --> 00:36:15.460
Man. what the fuck?

719
00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:17.878
- Prize. sufuckingprise.

720
00:36:17.878 --> 00:36:19.980
Tucan. put that fucking gun down.

721
00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:23.990
You ain't gonna do nothing with it.

722
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:26.253
- Man what the fuck is y'all want. man?

723
00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:28.363
- It's simple.

724
00:36:29.803 --> 00:36:32.623
We want you out the hood and out for good.

725
00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:35.477
Look at you.

726
00:36:35.477 --> 00:36:37.613
getting high off your own shit.

727
00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:41.180
You mother fuckers make rules
that you can't even follow.

728
00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:42.860
Man. take his money.

729
00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:44.230
- What you mean take my money?

730
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:45.350
Take my shit?

731
00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:46.267
Hold on. man.

732
00:36:46.267 --> 00:36:47.883
- Listen to me carefully.

733
00:36:47.883 --> 00:36:51.283
I don't want to see you
around here ever again.

734
00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:54.220
Nod your head that you understand.

735
00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:03.910
Now this. this right here is
our final warning. Dupree.

736
00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:10.305
Let's go.

737
00:37:10.305 --> 00:37:11.856
- What the fuck. man?

738
00:37:11.856 --> 00:37:13.930
Y'all just gonna take my shit like that?

739
00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:16.013
Fuck!

740
00:37:18.603 --> 00:37:20.210
See this shit. man?

741
00:37:44.508 --> 00:37:46.280
- Have you ever heard of the term

742
00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:49.120
your first impression
is your last impression?

743
00:37:51.106 --> 00:37:52.256
- I'm familiar with it.

744
00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:56.090
- I see you don't follow
directions very well.

745
00:37:57.759 --> 00:38:00.320
- Look. I'm dressed exactly as you asked.

746
00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.153
- You're late.

747
00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:08.010
Look one thing about me.
do not waste my time.

748
00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:11.018
Take out your phone.
plug in your earphones.

749
00:38:11.018 --> 00:38:13.018
look at your phone while you talk to me.

750
00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:21.730
- Smart. she's at the
back of the crime scene

751
00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:23.606
playing the good samaritan.

752
00:38:23.606 --> 00:38:25.850
As long as you were seen
trying to stop the bad guy.

753
00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:27.253
nobody connects you to it.

754
00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:29.613
Smart.

755
00:38:31.219 --> 00:38:33.957
- I see you're very observant.

756
00:38:35.627 --> 00:38:37.380
- I want in.

757
00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:38.600
- That's out.

758
00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:41.070
- You don't trust me.
all right. I get that.

759
00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:42.570
And the truth is that you never will.

760
00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:45.858
not till you give me a
chance to show you who I am.

761
00:38:45.858 --> 00:38:47.560
- White boy like you

762
00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:50.810
want to help a bunch of
radical niggers like us.

763
00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:51.643
I don't get it.

764
00:38:51.643 --> 00:38:53.890
What's in it for you?

765
00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:54.783
- Peace.

766
00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:56.860
I want to help bring it back

767
00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:59.110
to the communities that
we turned our backs on

768
00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:02.200
and left to decay while
profiting off of her decades.

769
00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:05.580
to prove to you that not all
us white boys are the same.

770
00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:07.616
I want the same things that you do

771
00:39:07.616 --> 00:39:08.520
and just cause I can't shoot a gun

772
00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.430
and I'm not skilled in those areas.

773
00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:12.770
it doesn't mean I'm not
skilled than others.

774
00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:15.543
Right. there've got to be ways
that don't involve killing.

775
00:39:18.105 --> 00:39:20.760
- I don't know. you told me white man.

776
00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:22.080
Is it?

777
00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:23.080
'Cause that's the same thing

778
00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:25.580
we've been asking you guys
for over 400 years now.

779
00:39:27.963 --> 00:39:32.343
This right here will help
you answer your question.

780
00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:55.010
- The gentlemen over here
asked me to give this to you

781
00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:56.900
and he paid for your drink.

782
00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:57.750
- What gentlemen?

783
00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:03.700
- Him over. well he was over there.

784
00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:10.347
(sexy music)

785
00:40:15.822 --> 00:40:16.655
- Some people regard the blue rose

786
00:40:16.655 --> 00:40:19.563
as an exhibition of inner
feelings of love at first sight.

787
00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:23.370
Some see it as a symbol of
prosperity and immortality.

788
00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:28.237
- And what do you see it as?

789
00:40:28.237 --> 00:40:30.770
- Can I have a drink with you?

790
00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:31.870
- You already sitting.

791
00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:37.560
- So what's your angle. sister?

792
00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:40.553
- Oh right to it. huh?

793
00:40:41.757 --> 00:40:43.483
Well what's your angle. my brother?

794
00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:45.263
- Me?

795
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:48.610
Just a city boy with inner city dreams

796
00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:53.590
of changing my community
and making it safe. so-

797
00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:55.700
- So you from South Central?

798
00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:58.870
- Hell yeah. from the West
side right off Crenshaw Sloss.

799
00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:59.890
born and raised.

800
00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:01.553
- Oh okay. I hear you. cuz.

801
00:41:01.553 --> 00:41:02.873
don't get all gangster on me.

802
00:41:05.469 --> 00:41:06.870
- What's your story?

803
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:08.240
- Just a girl from the East side

804
00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.820
on a mission to change. my brother.

805
00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:10.653
- That's right.

806
00:41:12.453 --> 00:41:14.933
So how long you've been down with Messiah?

807
00:41:16.605 --> 00:41:19.042
- Been wrecking with
Messiah for some years now.

808
00:41:19.042 --> 00:41:20.163
That's my guy right there.

809
00:41:22.503 --> 00:41:25.503
About to shake the city
up and change LA forever.

810
00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.350
Gotta make society safe

811
00:41:27.350 --> 00:41:29.280
for our children to live in. you know?

812
00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:31.590
We pray for change so much

813
00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:32.610
yet we're so distracted

814
00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:34.350
we don't see the means for change

815
00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:35.700
right in front of our face.

816
00:41:37.568 --> 00:41:39.918
- Oh so you got a big
appetite for change. huh?

817
00:41:41.222 --> 00:41:43.722
- That ain't the only thing
I got an appetite for.

818
00:41:44.736 --> 00:41:47.153

The night is over. man.
I'm trying to go to sleep.

836
00:43:01.141 --> 00:43:03.891
I don't want to listen to nobody.

837
00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:07.503
- [Female] 21. six.

838
00:43:12.039 --> 00:43:13.013
- [Messiah] This mother fucker.

839
00:43:13.013 --> 00:43:13.860
- [Girl] Daddy.

840
00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:14.937
- Come on. Messiah.

841
00:43:14.937 --> 00:43:15.770

842
00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:16.870
Come on. man. please
man. don't do this shit.

843
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:19.670
- [Messiah] Why not. huh?

844
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:20.853
Didn't we warn you?

845
00:43:22.545 --> 00:43:24.520
See you real hard headed. Dupree.

846
00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.120
- Hey Sharice!

847
00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:28.160
- We'll worry about your wife.

848
00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:29.860
She's back there getting
entertained by pretty Tony.

849
00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:31.490
- Come on Messiah. man.
don't do this shit. man.

850
00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:32.952
come on. man.

851
00:43:32.952 --> 00:43:35.400
- Oh okay. so you can
beg. but you can't listen.

852
00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:39.290
And you think it's okay to poison and feed

853
00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:40.789
everybody else's kids this shit

854
00:43:40.789 --> 00:43:44.300
but when we try to feed
your kid the same shit.

855
00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:45.200
oh it's a problem.

856
00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:50.683
I'm ashamed of you. Dupree. I really am.

857
00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:53.400
This is the same shit

858
00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:55.481
that poisoned our fathers back in the day

859
00:43:55.481 --> 00:43:58.033
and you still want to push this shit.

860
00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:01.990
- Come on brother. please. man.

861
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:03.860
Don't do that shit. man.

862
00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:04.693
- Bruh.

863
00:44:06.315 --> 00:44:08.723
you must be Kane and I must be Able. huh?

864
00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:12.673
Killing your own people.

865
00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:16.163
no. you no brother of mine.

866
00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:22.070
Now. not tomorrow. not
days from now. but tonight.

867
00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:23.660
and when I say tonight. motherfucker.

868
00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:25.510
you should've been packing yesterday.

869
00:44:27.383 --> 00:44:29.283
- [Dupree] What the fuck is this. man?

870
00:44:30.192 --> 00:44:31.363
- I want you gone. Dupree.

871
00:44:32.792 --> 00:44:36.430
I want you out of the
city. out of the state

872
00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:38.431
and out of the country.

873
00:44:38.431 --> 00:44:40.610
- Hey man. Big Gears ain't
gonna go for this shit. man.

874
00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:43.883
- Look. if I see you again.

875
00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:50.640
Dupree. I'm gonna kill
your ass my damn self.

876
00:45:21.867 --> 00:45:23.117
- Why the mask?

877
00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:27.320
- To give his kids the same nightmare

878
00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:28.820
he's been given the community.

879
00:45:30.672 --> 00:45:31.822
- Where your mask. Tom?

880
00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:34.620
- I'm wearing it.

881
00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:45.550
- I sense an emptiness in Khalid.

882
00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:48.170
one I've never seen before.

883
00:45:50.637 --> 00:45:53.583
It's like his spirit was
always walking in darkness.

884
00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:57.450
- [Interviewer] And when
did he lose it completely?

885
00:45:57.450 --> 00:45:59.880
- Lose it?

886
00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:00.713
Lose what?

887
00:46:02.007 --> 00:46:04.217
How could you lose
something you never had?

888
00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:13.640
- Hey. what's up sis?

889
00:46:14.909 --> 00:46:16.076
How you doing?

890
00:46:19.847 --> 00:46:22.264
Good. got some stuff for you.

891
00:46:26.073 --> 00:46:28.449
Got some canned goods for you.

892
00:46:28.449 --> 00:46:30.199

893
00:46:32.217 --> 00:46:35.884

chips and all that.

894
00:46:37.335 --> 00:46:39.085
Got some nail polish.

895
00:46:39.983 --> 00:46:40.816
And guess what?

896
00:46:40.816 --> 00:46:42.490
You know your favorite
song you used to sing to

897
00:46:42.490 --> 00:46:43.990
when I was little?

898
00:46:45.077 --> 00:46:47.420
I even got that shit on your phone too

899
00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:48.907
so you can sing to it.

900
00:46:48.907 --> 00:46:49.993
Get what else I got?

901
00:46:49.993 --> 00:46:52.076
I got a surprise for you.

902
00:46:54.002 --> 00:46:56.010
(laughing)

903
00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:57.290
- Hey. she got a date tonight.

904
00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:58.760
They ain't got Netflix.

905
00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:00.560
so I guess they gonna bum and chill.

906
00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:05.367
I never seen two bums
have a picnic on concrete.

907
00:47:05.367 --> 00:47:07.290
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa-

908
00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:09.678
- Look motherfucker. if I
ever catch you around here.

909
00:47:09.678 --> 00:47:11.691
look at me. mother fucker.
when I'm talking to you.

910
00:47:11.691 --> 00:47:13.240
I better not ever see you
around this motherfucker again.

911
00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:14.073
you hear me?

912
00:47:14.073 --> 00:47:16.343
Just nod your motherfucking hand slow.

913
00:47:16.343 --> 00:47:18.083
Do you understand me?

914
00:47:18.083 --> 00:47:19.494
Get the fuck outta here.

915
00:47:19.494 --> 00:47:21.911
Get the fuck outta here. man.

916
00:47:31.351 --> 00:47:33.801
I'm sorry about that shit. sis.

917
00:47:33.801 --> 00:47:35.337
You ain't gotta worry about
that little mother fucker

918
00:47:35.337 --> 00:47:37.671
fucking with you no more.

919
00:47:37.671 --> 00:47:39.723
I tell you what though.

920
00:47:39.723 --> 00:47:44.306
you ain't gonna be able to
beat me in speed. of course.

921
00:47:46.089 --> 00:47:47.794
I got something for you.

922
00:47:47.794 --> 00:47:50.834
I'm gonna show you I've been practicing.

923
00:47:50.834 --> 00:47:53.417
Show you I've been practicing.

924
00:48:03.654 --> 00:48:06.154
(chill music)

925
00:48:16.801 --> 00:48:17.923
- How's it going. man?

926
00:48:17.923 --> 00:48:19.618
- Not too bad.

927
00:48:19.618 --> 00:48:21.368
- It's cold out here.

928
00:48:24.067 --> 00:48:25.799
Hey you want a hit of this?

929
00:48:25.799 --> 00:48:27.748
- No. thank you.

930
00:48:27.748 --> 00:48:28.748
- All right.

931
00:48:30.915 --> 00:48:32.710
Hey. did you know this guy?

932
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:34.110
- You can say that.

933
00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:35.640
- Really?

934
00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:38.310
I didn't know he had any
friends who were niggers.

935
00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:40.340
Now. I knew he had a nigger pat or two

936
00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:41.943
but no nigger friends.

937
00:48:43.291 --> 00:48:45.620
- You'd be surprised about what you find

938
00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:48.070
behind the hillbillies trailer park.

939
00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:49.620
- Oh. you got some you
want to say to me. boy?

940
00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:50.470
- I just said it.

941
00:48:51.439 --> 00:48:53.789
You know it's a real
shame why they killed him.

942
00:48:55.283 --> 00:48:57.780
- Yeah. it's tragic.

943
00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:59.210
You know it's very unfortunate

944
00:48:59.210 --> 00:49:01.783
whenever an innocent
officer's blood is shed.

945
00:49:03.142 --> 00:49:04.630
- Unfortunate. huh?

946
00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:08.440
If you need any representation.

947
00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:09.753
any representation at all.

948
00:49:10.738 --> 00:49:11.793
give me a call.

949
00:49:13.624 --> 00:49:14.743
- I think I'm good.

950
00:49:16.241 --> 00:49:18.825
- Oh that's right.

951
00:49:18.825 --> 00:49:21.075
you got all the
representation you need. huh?

952
00:49:22.199 --> 00:49:25.693
- Okay. good day detective.
we'll keep in touch.

953
00:49:35.409 --> 00:49:36.460
- [Male] Hello?

954
00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:38.423
- Yeah. what's up?
- [Male] Who the fuck is this?

955
00:49:38.423 --> 00:49:39.980
- It's me. Cooper. motherfucker.

956
00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:41.080
- [Male] You got a fucking appointment?

957
00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:43.013
- No. no. no bullshit. I want to see her.

958
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:48.600
- [Male] Excuse me. brother. excuse me.

959
00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:52.040
Bro. you got to try my homemade nachos.

960
00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:53.420
- Seriously?

961
00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:55.510
- [Lucren] I told you I was
going to bring them by. man.

962
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:57.750
- [Messiah] Okay. all right.

963
00:49:57.750 --> 00:50:00.850
- Yeah. get some of that meat on there.

964
00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:01.833
I told you!

965
00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:05.972
I told you they was fire. man.

966
00:50:05.972 --> 00:50:07.207
- Khalid. you gotta try
some of these nachos.

967
00:50:07.207 --> 00:50:09.320
- No. no. I'm good brother.
you knock yourself out.

968
00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:10.637
I'm good.

969
00:50:10.637 --> 00:50:14.520
- You gotta tell me what did
you use to season the chicken?

970
00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:15.903
- Sorry brother. can't tell you that.

971
00:50:15.903 --> 00:50:17.030
It's a family secret.

972
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:18.370
If told you. I'd have to kill you.

973
00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:19.980
- Look. look. look at all of us here.

974
00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:21.640
We're like family.

975
00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:22.773
What did you use?

976
00:50:26.439 --> 00:50:28.243
- Okay man. look.

977
00:50:29.549 --> 00:50:33.310
the trick is I use lemon
pepper. garlic butter.

978
00:50:33.310 --> 00:50:36.207
and I marinate the meat
in lemon and lime juice.

979
00:50:36.207 --> 00:50:37.760
- Mmm.

980
00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:39.180
- Just that easy. huh?

981
00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:43.163
- Excuse me?

982
00:50:44.027 --> 00:50:46.353
- Well. I thought you said
it was a family secret.

983
00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:48.973
- It was.

984
00:50:49.847 --> 00:50:51.610
- Well if it was a family secret

985
00:50:51.610 --> 00:50:53.590
that wasn't supposed to be told.

986
00:50:53.590 --> 00:50:54.737
why did you tell him?

987
00:51:01.579 --> 00:51:03.246
What you staring at?

988
00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:10.293
- Nothing. nothing. I'm
sorry. I was just looking.

989
00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:13.680
- Just looking'll get you clip

990
00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:15.053
and looking too. too hard my brother

991
00:51:15.053 --> 00:51:17.520
will get you one of these.

992
00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:19.133
Don't watch me. watch your step.

993
00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:24.693
So you tell all secrets under
pressure this fast brother?

994
00:51:27.125 --> 00:51:28.963
- Don't even worry about him. okay.

995
00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:33.030
Did you and Caira take
care of those reports

996
00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:35.040
from the comedian yesterday?

997
00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:36.760
- We're actually supposed to
be linking up this evening

998
00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:37.700
to get 'em done.

999
00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:39.280
You know. she's kind of tough to work with

1000
00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:40.113
'cause of her schedule.

1001
00:51:40.113 --> 00:51:43.020
but we're most certainly
connecting this evening

1002
00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:44.414
to get it in.

1003
00:51:44.414 --> 00:51:45.890
- Yeah.

1004
00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:47.683
- I'm sorry. and who are you again?

1005
00:51:48.610 --> 00:51:50.290
- I'm the street sweeper.

1006
00:51:50.290 --> 00:51:51.870
I keep the streets clean.

1007
00:51:51.870 --> 00:51:53.191
- You from around here?

1008
00:51:53.191 --> 00:51:54.310
- Born and raised.

1009
00:51:54.310 --> 00:51:55.260
- Yeah. what parts?

1010
00:51:56.690 --> 00:51:58.450
- [Luke] Pick a card. brother.
- Luke.

1011
00:51:58.450 --> 00:52:00.120
- No. it's cool.

1012
00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:01.073
I like games.

1013
00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:04.980
- You got your card?

1014
00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:06.383
- Yeah.
- You see it?

1015
00:52:08.046 --> 00:52:10.246
Let me ask you brother.

1016
00:52:10.246 --> 00:52:12.243
you familiar with the term

1017
00:52:12.243 --> 00:52:14.453
never sleep where you piss at?

1018
00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:17.123
So you and Caira.

1019
00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:19.630
you two fucking each other or what?

1020
00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:22.120
- That's none of your damn business.

1021
00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:24.840
- Making sure that your focus
is on business and not pussy.

1022
00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:26.189
that's all.

1023
00:52:26.189 --> 00:52:27.022
- [Lucren] Who the hell is this guy?

1024
00:52:27.022 --> 00:52:28.773
- Luke. I'm sorry. brother.

1025
00:52:30.430 --> 00:52:31.940
Please forgive me.

1026
00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:34.890
but we will talk soon then. all right?

1027
00:52:34.890 --> 00:52:35.723
- [Lucren] Yeah.

1028
00:52:35.723 --> 00:52:36.840
- Thank you for the nachos.

1029
00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:38.413
- [Lucren] No worries. man.

1030
00:52:38.413 --> 00:52:39.707
- It was nice to meet you. Luke.

1031
00:52:39.707 --> 00:52:41.350
- I'm sorry about what happened earlier.

1032
00:52:41.350 --> 00:52:43.050
I didn't mean no harm by it.

1033
00:52:43.050 --> 00:52:44.520
I'm sorry brother.

1034
00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:45.393
Sorry about that.

1035
00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:47.323
- It's cool.

1036
00:52:49.286 --> 00:52:51.223
- He a snake and I don't trust him.

1037
00:52:51.223 --> 00:52:53.615
- How the fuck you know. huh?

1038
00:52:53.615 --> 00:52:56.943
Every time. Khalid. I'm
telling. you always do this.

1039
00:52:57.986 --> 00:52:59.200
- Let me tell you something. Messiah.

1040
00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:01.170
When a dog does wrong.

1041
00:53:01.170 --> 00:53:03.210
it'll keep his head down at all times.

1042
00:53:03.210 --> 00:53:04.750
But a snake.

1043
00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:08.003
a snake will look in your
eye every single time.

1044
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:12.223
Watch the company you keep
and stop trusting everybody.

1045
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:16.510
I mean hell even your
teeth bite your tongue

1046
00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:17.890
every once in a while.

1047
00:53:25.482 --> 00:53:29.333
- Celeste. this bitch got me fucked up.

1048
00:53:31.291 --> 00:53:32.623
What the fuck got all your attention?

1049
00:53:34.477 --> 00:53:37.160
You daydreaming again. huh?

1050
00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:38.113
Beauty school?

1051
00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:40.303
Cut that shit out.

1052
00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:43.033
You got a fucking appointment.

1053
00:53:43.033 --> 00:53:43.950
- With who?

1054
00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:46.920
- Bitch. what you mean with who?

1055
00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:52.343
Stand the fuck up when I'm talking to you.

1056
00:53:52.343 --> 00:53:53.176
You ever question me again.

1057
00:53:53.176 --> 00:53:54.770
I'll kill your motherfucking ass.

1058
00:53:54.770 --> 00:53:56.300
The officer want to see you.

1059
00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:58.600
- Please. Mouse. don't send me to him.

1060
00:53:58.600 --> 00:53:59.667
Please. anybody but him.

1061
00:53:59.667 --> 00:54:01.210
please baby come on.

1062
00:54:01.210 --> 00:54:02.520
I'll do anything please-

1063
00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:04.017
- Baby?

1064
00:54:04.017 --> 00:54:07.183
I thought I was the only
one who could call you baby.

1065
00:54:10.170 --> 00:54:11.500
- So you really don't want to go?

1066
00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:13.348
- No please.

1067
00:54:13.348 --> 00:54:14.431
- Okay. okay.

1068
00:54:16.533 --> 00:54:17.366
It's okay.

1069
00:54:20.732 --> 00:54:22.982
(grunting)

1070
00:54:25.158 --> 00:54:27.490
You gonna go wherever the
fuck I tell you to go.

1071
00:54:27.490 --> 00:54:30.140
Now head to the car before
this be another situation.

1072
00:54:31.170 --> 00:54:32.063
Scram!

1073
00:54:44.365 --> 00:54:45.310
- I told you we just need a few weeks

1074
00:54:45.310 --> 00:54:46.180
for the checks to clear

1075
00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:47.530
and get the books straight-

1076
00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:51.843
- Look at my sexy daddy
all in business mode.

1077
00:54:55.690 --> 00:54:57.750
I figured you were hungry
so I brought you some food.

1078
00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:58.583
- You figured wrong.

1079
00:54:58.583 --> 00:54:59.683
We doing pop ups now?

1080
00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:01.993
- Excuse me?

1081
00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:05.690
Look. Caira. I know the
crack the other night

1082
00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:06.523
was cool and all

1083
00:55:06.523 --> 00:55:08.390
but that's all it was. okay?

1084
00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:09.319
Fun.

1085
00:55:09.319 --> 00:55:12.160
We fell into the moment and that's that.

1086
00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:14.170
I'm not looking for a soul mate.

1087
00:55:14.170 --> 00:55:17.020
- Me neither. nigger. I just
brought your ass some food.

1088
00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:18.540
that's it. that's all.

1089
00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:21.920
- Look. don't get all colored girl on me.

1090
00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:23.960
I didn't ask for the food
or for you to show up.

1091
00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:27.099
but I am asking for you to
leave so I can finish my work.

1092
00:55:27.099 --> 00:55:29.230
(laughs)

1093
00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:30.063
- Fo sho.

1094
00:56:01.484 --> 00:56:03.234
- Hey. how's my baby?

1095
00:56:04.827 --> 00:56:06.494
Mmm. you smell good.

1096
00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:08.173
You miss me?

1097
00:56:08.173 --> 00:56:11.250
- Put the money on the table first.

1098
00:56:11.250 --> 00:56:12.462
- What's that?

1099
00:56:12.462 --> 00:56:13.295
Say that again.

1100
00:56:13.295 --> 00:56:14.930
- Put the money on the table.

1101
00:56:14.930 --> 00:56:18.823
- Oh. put the money on the table. sir.

1102
00:56:20.904 --> 00:56:22.554
Isn't that what you meant to say?

1103
00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:26.190
How many times have I told
you how to address me?

1104
00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:28.220
Huh. let me hear you say it.

1105
00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:29.460
Hold on. I got it.

1106
00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:32.260
why don't I just have you
start calling me master?

1107
00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:34.490
You'll like that. that's
easy for you to remember.

1108
00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:35.980
Come on. let me hear it.

1109
00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:39.433
- Put the money on the table. sir.

1110
00:56:41.130 --> 00:56:43.580
- See baby that wasn't so hard. huh?

1111
00:56:43.580 --> 00:56:45.523
Come on. we're gonna have fun.

1112
00:56:49.170 --> 00:56:51.257
You won't believe the fucking day I had.

1113
00:57:01.090 --> 00:57:06.090
Baby. come on. do that thing you do to me.

1114
00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:09.363
Come here baby. sit on me.

1115
00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:11.073
Come on. come on.

1116
00:57:13.823 --> 00:57:16.965
- I know that that mother fucking Cooper

1117
00:57:16.965 --> 00:57:19.113
shot Christopher Walker too.

1118
00:57:21.064 --> 00:57:22.683
He shot first.

1119
00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:25.590
- It'll be handled.

1120
00:57:25.590 --> 00:57:26.423
- Yeah. when?

1121
00:57:28.258 --> 00:57:31.060
- As soon as we get
everything done with the rest.

1122
00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:33.573
Come on. y'all know this.
first thing is first.

1123
00:57:34.683 --> 00:57:37.200
- Yeah. see the only thing about that.

1124
00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:39.240
the spot that you want it in.

1125
00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:41.581
that's Big Gears and Key Way territory.

1126
00:57:41.581 --> 00:57:42.930
- Man. fuck their territory.

1127
00:57:42.930 --> 00:57:44.070
They don't need to be serving that shit

1128
00:57:44.070 --> 00:57:45.892
over there in front of them kids no way.

1129
00:57:45.892 --> 00:57:49.060
All that bullshit
prostitution. dope dealing.

1130
00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:52.290
drug spots. dispensaries.
all that shit is out.

1131
00:57:52.290 --> 00:57:54.573
they don't need to be over
there in the first place.

1132
00:57:55.568 --> 00:57:58.300
- Now it's just a matter of explaining it.

1133
00:57:58.300 --> 00:57:59.133
- For what?

1134
00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:06.023
- Ain't shit to explain.
either relocate or else.

1135
00:58:07.629 --> 00:58:09.023
- That part right there.

1136
00:58:09.023 --> 00:58:11.625
That part right there.

1137
00:58:11.625 --> 00:58:13.053
- You know what doc.

1138
00:58:14.688 --> 00:58:17.138
you been hanging around
Khalid a little too much.

1139
00:58:18.550 --> 00:58:22.046
There's different ways to
handle situations like this.

1140
00:58:22.046 --> 00:58:22.879
You know what?

1141
00:58:22.879 --> 00:58:23.712
I'll go talk to him.

1142
00:58:23.712 --> 00:58:25.420
- And I'll go with you.

1143
00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:26.253
- Look Khalid.

1144
00:58:26.253 --> 00:58:28.423
there don't need to be no bloodshed.

1145
00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:31.970
Right now. we don't
need a war on our hands.

1146
00:58:31.970 --> 00:58:32.803
It's already bad enough

1147
00:58:32.803 --> 00:58:35.057
we got this damn detective
around following us and shit.

1148
00:58:36.248 --> 00:58:38.890
- Look. man. I'mma go.

1149
00:58:38.890 --> 00:58:41.351
I ain't gonna do shit.
I'mma be cool when I go.

1150
00:58:41.351 --> 00:58:43.389
- Oh. you gonna be cool?

1151
00:58:43.389 --> 00:58:44.740
You're gonna be cool?

1152
00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:47.310
- Come on. man. look.
I'mma be cool. I promise.

1153
00:58:47.310 --> 00:58:48.230
Fuck it man. look.

1154
00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:50.400
I won't even take my
gun with me this time.

1155
00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:52.360
but let me tell you
something though Messiah.

1156
00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:53.460
watch out Mike.

1157
00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:55.503
being all cool and diplomatic and shit

1158
00:58:55.503 --> 00:58:57.440
that ain't gonna get you nowhere. man.

1159
00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:59.140
We don't understand that shit.

1160
00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:02.003
Sometimes violence is the
only thing we understand.

1161
00:59:02.953 --> 00:59:05.073
You listening to what I'm saying. Messiah?

1162
00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:07.583
Sometimes that's all we know.

1163
00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:09.553
All we know.

1164
00:59:18.790 --> 00:59:20.413
- You liked that. didn't you baby?

1165
00:59:22.095 --> 00:59:24.840
You didn't know a white boy
could fuck like that. did you?

1166
00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:27.743
Yeah. well you had me motivated.

1167
00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:29.830
I'll tell you what.

1168
00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:32.870
I will be penciling you in tonight.

1169
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:34.120
- [Celeste] No you won't.

1170
00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:36.487
- Why is that?

1171
00:59:36.487 --> 00:59:38.550
- 'Cause I'm done.

1172
00:59:38.550 --> 00:59:39.460
I'm fucking done.

1173
00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:41.756
I'm not doing this shit no more.

1174
00:59:41.756 --> 00:59:45.034
- You know where my wedding ring is. baby?

1175
00:59:45.034 --> 00:59:46.284
What'd you say?

1176
00:59:48.023 --> 00:59:49.590
- I'm fucking done.

1177
00:59:49.590 --> 00:59:51.713
I'm not doing this shit no more.

1178
00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:55.860
- Bitch please. you're done
when I say you're done.

1179
00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:57.306
This is me. come on.

1180
00:59:57.306 --> 01:00:01.822
you gonna give this up?

1181
01:00:01.822 --> 01:00:03.155
Are you serious?

1182
01:00:06.652 --> 01:00:07.485
You want to quit me?

1183
01:00:07.485 --> 01:00:08.318
You want to-

1184
01:00:10.747 --> 01:00:14.260
Listen. listen. listen.
listen you fucking whore.

1185
01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:16.020
Listen. shut up. you're fucking done

1186
01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:17.490
when I say you're done. all right?

1187
01:00:17.490 --> 01:00:20.459
Listen. who's gonna pay your
fucking bills for you. huh?

1188
01:00:20.459 --> 01:00:21.820
If you don't have me.

1189
01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:23.810
who's gonna pay for this
fucking ugly makeup?

1190
01:00:23.810 --> 01:00:25.993
And by the way. who
the fuck gave you that?

1191
01:00:25.993 --> 01:00:28.176
You bitch.

1192
01:00:28.176 --> 01:00:29.940
- Get off of me.
- Shut up.

1193
01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:31.430
Shut the fuck up.

1194
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:33.589
I'm all you've got. you stupid skank.

1195
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:36.037
What do you want to do. huh?

1196
01:00:36.037 --> 01:00:38.516
You want to quit the life and do what?

1197
01:00:38.516 --> 01:00:40.370
You gonna go to med school.
want to be a doctor?

1198
01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:41.710
Well you know what.

1199
01:00:41.710 --> 01:00:43.418
maybe you can volunteer in a church

1200
01:00:43.418 --> 01:00:44.370
with your fucking boyfriend.

1201
01:00:44.370 --> 01:00:46.020
that fucking faggot pimp.

1202
01:00:47.352 --> 01:00:51.019
(both yelling and grunting)

1203
01:00:53.514 --> 01:00:54.680
You know you are.

1204
01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:55.583
You know you are.

1205
01:01:00.889 --> 01:01:03.814
I don't even know what I'm doing with you.

1206
01:01:03.814 --> 01:01:05.417
I don't like you.

1207
01:01:06.278 --> 01:01:08.280
You don't even like yourself.

1208
01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:09.843
Look at this.

1209
01:01:10.690 --> 01:01:11.590
You gonna quit me?

1210
01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:14.059
Yeah. you want to quit me. don't you?

1211
01:01:14.059 --> 01:01:15.115
- No.
- Yeah you do.

1212
01:01:15.115 --> 01:01:17.532
- No. no. no.
- Fucking do it.

1213
01:01:18.396 --> 01:01:19.669
fucking do it.

1214
01:01:19.669 --> 01:01:22.502
(Celeste crying)

1215
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:28.453
- What do you think the
difference is between you and I?

1216
01:01:29.550 --> 01:01:33.600
- You afraid to pull the trigger. I'm not.

1217
01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:35.950
- It's not that I'm afraid
to pull the trigger.

1218
01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:39.923
I just think before I react.

1219
01:01:41.539 --> 01:01:43.589
- Hey let me tell you something. Messiah.

1220
01:01:45.532 --> 01:01:48.800
That second you spend
thinking can be your last.

1221
01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:51.460
You see me. I think before every.

1222
01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:52.730
every decision I make

1223
01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:55.180
and I'm willing to deal
with the consequences.

1224
01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:56.023
- Oh. okay.

1225
01:01:56.970 --> 01:01:58.070
So what?

1226
01:01:58.070 --> 01:02:00.240
What does that make you. huh?

1227
01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.890
That makes your moves.
your decisions smart

1228
01:02:02.890 --> 01:02:04.520
or does it make you a loose cannon?

1229
01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.620
- It makes me a risk taker.

1230
01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:09.270
Somebody who's not afraid
to make sacrifices.

1231
01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:10.720
You see in this game of life. Messiah.

1232
01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.303
it's either kill or be killed.

1233
01:02:13.808 --> 01:02:16.513
But you wouldn't know nothing
about that shit. right?

1234
01:02:18.777 --> 01:02:21.263
- And that's okay for you. huh?

1235
01:02:21.263 --> 01:02:24.157
It's okay for you to
sacrifice your own man?

1236
01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:28.768
- Well. you know me.

1237
01:02:28.768 --> 01:02:32.053
I think it's better to sacrifice
my man's opponent first.

1238
01:02:33.330 --> 01:02:34.460
Check.

1239
01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:36.100
- You ain't never gonna understand.

1240
01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:38.120
It's a war out there. Khalid.

1241
01:02:39.258 --> 01:02:41.650
The streets ain't changing.

1242
01:02:41.650 --> 01:02:43.190
the world isn't changing.

1243
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:44.593
Everything's getting worse.

1244
01:02:46.108 --> 01:02:48.210
You can't be out here
every day in these streets

1245
01:02:48.210 --> 01:02:51.500
planning and saying. but you know what.

1246
01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:56.500
always remember this. make
your next move your best move.

1247
01:02:59.190 --> 01:03:00.023
Checkmate.

1248
01:03:02.730 --> 01:03:04.210
- Wake up Messiah.

1249
01:03:04.210 --> 01:03:06.580
You know what. fuck it. you right.

1250
01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:07.980
it is a war out there.

1251
01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:09.910
And let me tell you something.

1252
01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:12.300
you cannot play both sides of the fence.

1253
01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:15.010
Either you shaking hands
or you slapping cheeks.

1254
01:03:15.010 --> 01:03:16.120
either it's peace or violence.

1255
01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:17.453
but you can't do both.

1256
01:03:18.350 --> 01:03:19.183
That's your problem.

1257
01:03:19.183 --> 01:03:21.360
it's always been your problem.

1258
01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:23.300
I just don't understand your ass. man.

1259
01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:24.133
I got one eye

1260
01:03:24.133 --> 01:03:26.470
I still see clearer than yo ass.

1261
01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:30.800
You see. chess. it doesn't
drive people insane

1262
01:03:32.079 --> 01:03:35.903
but it keeps insane
motherfuckers like me sane.

1263
01:03:37.237 --> 01:03:38.844
Checkmate.

1264
01:03:38.844 --> 01:03:41.664
(phone buzzing)

1265
01:03:41.664 --> 01:03:42.514
Yeah. talk to me.

1266
01:03:44.817 --> 01:03:45.650
What?

1267
01:03:48.284 --> 01:03:49.951
- They took my baby.

1268
01:03:51.383 --> 01:03:54.216
(mumbled yelling)

1269
01:04:01.802 --> 01:04:04.552

1270
01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:32.267

Who's his bottle?

01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:11.493
Who?
- Her.

1283
01:05:12.451 --> 01:05:14.180
- Mother fucker. you mean to tell me

1284
01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:15.630

hands on our sisters

1285
01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:17.540

01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:18.557
Get your bitch ass up.

01:05:18.557 --> 01:05:20.162
Get up nigger.

1288
01:05:20.162 --> 01:05:22.877
Mother fucker. get up. get your ass up.

1289
01:05:22.877 --> 01:05:24.070
Get the fuck up.

1290
01:05:24.070 --> 01:05:29.070
Get your mother fucking ass over here.

1291
01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:30.750
We gonna see how tough you are
in a second. mother fucker.

1292
01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:31.670
Shut up.

1293
01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:32.670
- Slap him.

1294
01:05:32.670 --> 01:05:34.870
- Keep your mother
fucking hands up. nigger.

1295
01:05:35.822 --> 01:05:37.253
- I said slap him.

1296
01:05:38.789 --> 01:05:40.355
(gunfire blasting)

1297
01:05:40.355 --> 01:05:42.130
(girls yelling)

1298
01:05:42.130 --> 01:05:44.086
This next one gonna be in
your mother fucking head.

1299
01:05:44.086 --> 01:05:45.169
slap him.

1300
01:05:45.169 --> 01:05:46.002
Slap him!

1301
01:05:47.893 --> 01:05:50.000
I'm not fucking playing with you.

1302
01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.940
I will kill you right
here where you stand.

1303
01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:53.050
You better slap him.

1304
01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:54.707
I'm not playing.

1305
01:05:54.707 --> 01:05:56.600
I said slap this motherfucker.

1306
01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:57.507
Slap him.

1307
01:05:59.562 --> 01:06:01.453
- I'm so sorry. baby.

1308
01:06:01.453 --> 01:06:02.286
- Sorry?

1309
01:06:02.286 --> 01:06:04.030
What the fuck you sorry for?

1310
01:06:04.030 --> 01:06:07.768
This punk motherfucker got
Celeste killed and you sorry?

1311
01:06:07.768 --> 01:06:09.363
- Bitch ass nigger.

1312
01:06:09.363 --> 01:06:10.446
- What. dead?

1313
01:06:12.338 --> 01:06:13.671
Celeste is dead?

1314
01:06:15.374 --> 01:06:17.040
- Yeah.

1315
01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:17.873
- Harder.

1316
01:06:19.952 --> 01:06:20.785
Harder.

1317
01:06:23.216 --> 01:06:24.049
Harder!

1318
01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:28.460
Sit your ass down.

1319
01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:30.543
(crying)

1320
01:06:31.419 --> 01:06:32.252
Sit down.

1321
01:06:32.252 --> 01:06:34.335
(crying)

1322
01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:38.350
East Side Doc.
- Yes. sir?

1323
01:06:38.350 --> 01:06:40.227
- Touch this mother fucker.

1324
01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:44.293
- Let this shit be clear right here.

1325
01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:46.910
All that pimping and hoeing shit is out.

1326
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:48.160
That shit ends right now.

1327
01:06:49.444 --> 01:06:51.190
If I catch any of y'all

1328
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:54.150
walking down these motherfucking
streets. that's it.

1329
01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:55.130
I swear to God. man.

1330
01:06:55.130 --> 01:06:57.430
that'll be your last
time walking permanently.

1331
01:06:59.210 --> 01:07:01.040
This punk mother fucker degrading y'all

1332
01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.440
and treating y'all like shit

1333
01:07:04.035 --> 01:07:06.323
and edifying this white broad.

1334
01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:08.793
Pick his ass up. man.

1335
01:07:10.009 --> 01:07:12.592
(girls crying)

1336
01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:17.080
Shut up. motherfucker.

1337
01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:18.930
Who was the last person with Celeste?

1338
01:07:20.197 --> 01:07:22.780
(girls crying)

1339
01:07:25.308 --> 01:07:27.140
This motherfucking trap house is closed.

1340
01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:28.223
No trespassing.

1341
01:07:31.703 --> 01:07:34.286
(girls crying)

1342
01:07:51.288 --> 01:07:53.477
- So what's on your mind?
What's bothering you?

1343
01:07:53.477 --> 01:07:54.730
- You know me.

1344
01:07:54.730 --> 01:07:57.503
once I start thinking
I'm all over the place.

1345
01:08:00.832 --> 01:08:01.665
I don't know.

1346
01:08:02.590 --> 01:08:03.950
I guess I'm just.

1347
01:08:03.950 --> 01:08:04.890
I'm sick and tired

1348
01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:09.400
of how things are going in our community

1349
01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:10.663
and our neighborhoods.

1350
01:08:12.728 --> 01:08:16.261
I feel like our people.
we're going backwards

1351
01:08:16.261 --> 01:08:20.680
and we don't even see it.

1352
01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:24.323
Handout after handout. nothing's changed.

1353
01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:29.163
We had Obama. nothing changed.

1354
01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:32.430
I feel like when he was in office

1355
01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:35.123
that's when most of the
police killings happened.

1356
01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:40.223
I don't know. Mr. Williams.

1357
01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:47.660
I sit and I think and at least
five times out of my day.

1358
01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:53.320
I ask myself. what are we doing wrong?

1359
01:08:54.710 --> 01:08:56.380
- Waiting for a savior. son.

1360
01:08:59.217 --> 01:09:00.417
And while we're waiting.

1361
01:09:03.783 --> 01:09:04.763
the world keeps turning.

1362
01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:09.233
While we're waiting. hate keeps turning.

1363
01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:13.040
While we're waiting.

1364
01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:14.533
time is still turning.

1365
01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:20.493
- Still. I'm sick and I'm
tired of this. everything.

1366
01:09:23.201 --> 01:09:28.003
Praying and marching. for what. hmm?

1367
01:09:29.110 --> 01:09:31.720
It's not effective. you
and I both know that.

1368
01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:34.743
- Prayer is effective. but with action.

1369
01:09:36.203 --> 01:09:39.693
Now God didn't say pray
and then go sit somewhere.

1370
01:09:41.485 --> 01:09:44.160
You pray and then you
apply the action of belief.

1371
01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:46.133
the action of change.

1372
01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:49.777
And if you want change bad enough.

1373
01:09:49.777 --> 01:09:52.370
you go out there and get it yourself

1374
01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:53.810
because you know if you don't change.

1375
01:09:53.810 --> 01:09:55.123
nothing will ever change.

1376
01:09:57.895 --> 01:09:58.728
There'll be some speed bumps.

1377
01:09:58.728 --> 01:10:02.293
some road blocks along the
way. but proceed with caution.

1378
01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:08.720
- So back in your day.

1379
01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:12.003
what would you have done for change?

1380
01:10:16.329 --> 01:10:17.329
- Bloodshed.

1381
01:10:21.701 --> 01:10:24.451
(dramatic music)

1382
01:10:25.993 --> 01:10:28.660
(ominous music)

1383
01:10:59.527 --> 01:11:03.049
- Well if it isn't the
mighty Messiah. the savior.

1384
01:11:03.049 --> 01:11:04.610
I heard you was looking for me.

1385
01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:05.760
- Used to deal. Khalid.

1386
01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:09.700
- Shit. ain't much Key Wade.

1387
01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:11.420
I see business is booming though.

1388
01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:12.768
- Metro.

1389
01:11:12.768 --> 01:11:14.497
- What the fuck y'all want?

1390
01:11:14.497 --> 01:11:15.970
After y'all did with y'all did

1391
01:11:15.970 --> 01:11:17.163
to my orders from homeless people.

1392
01:11:17.163 --> 01:11:18.790
what the fuck you did to Dupree.

1393
01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:21.140
you got a lot of balls
coming down here. cuz.

1394
01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:24.153
- Let's just hope y'all get
up out of here with them.

1395
01:11:24.153 --> 01:11:26.930
- Okay. well let's cut
straight to it then.

1396
01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:30.400
We got a lot planned for the community.

1397
01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:33.430
And right now we're building
a rec center for the teams.

1398
01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:36.418
- Eh. that shit got to do with me?

1399
01:11:36.418 --> 01:11:38.490
- Exactly. that right there.

1400
01:11:38.490 --> 01:11:40.230
It has nothing to do with you

1401
01:11:40.230 --> 01:11:42.650
and we want to keep it that way.

1402
01:11:42.650 --> 01:11:44.793
No more drugs. prostitution.

1403
01:11:45.948 --> 01:11:47.615
no more hanging out.

1404
01:11:48.803 --> 01:11:50.163
no more graffiti. nothing.

1405
01:11:51.190 --> 01:11:53.940
Come on. Gears. you got to
meet us halfway on this one.

1406
01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:57.379
We want to keep this clean.

1407
01:11:57.379 --> 01:11:58.212
(laughs)

1408
01:11:58.212 --> 01:11:59.258
- Clean?

1409
01:11:59.258 --> 01:12:01.090
This mother fucker.

1410
01:12:01.090 --> 01:12:02.582
- Are we clear?

1411
01:12:02.582 --> 01:12:04.623
- No nigger. we ain't clear.

1412
01:12:04.623 --> 01:12:05.737
You know who the fuck you talking to?

1413
01:12:05.737 --> 01:12:08.156
- All right. so let's do
this shit right here. nigger.

1414
01:12:08.156 --> 01:12:11.160
What y'all niggers want to do. huh?

1415
01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.350
Fuck the talking.

1416
01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:14.010
And who the fuck we talking to?

1417
01:12:14.010 --> 01:12:16.160
You better put that shit away. Deandre.

1418
01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:17.370
He was the same nigger that was a blood

1419
01:12:17.370 --> 01:12:19.210
before you got on this niggers set.

1420
01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:20.923
So fuck it man. fuck the bullshit.

1421
01:12:21.810 --> 01:12:23.890
You punk motherfuckers make me sick.

1422
01:12:23.890 --> 01:12:25.360
Y'all so high and coked out. man.

1423
01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:27.770
y'all don't even recognize
who the real enemies are.

1424
01:12:27.770 --> 01:12:28.810
We come down here to tell y'all

1425
01:12:28.810 --> 01:12:30.360
to stop serving around the kids.

1426
01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:32.060
around our people. to our people.

1427
01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:34.210
you motherfuckers pull your guns out.

1428
01:12:34.210 --> 01:12:35.750
but let the cops kill somebody.

1429
01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:36.583
kill our own.

1430
01:12:36.583 --> 01:12:38.280
y'all motherfuckers ain't
nowhere to be found.

1431
01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:40.720
Where's all that tough guy shit then?

1432
01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:42.200
Punk mother fuckers.

1433
01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:44.500
Make me sick to my stomach. man.

1434
01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:46.320
They worse than the KKK.

1435
01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:48.080
Make me no never fucking mind.

1436
01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:49.770
Let me know when to do this shit. Messiah.

1437
01:12:49.770 --> 01:12:51.400
fuck the talking.

1438
01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:53.832
- Look big homie. what it's gonna be?

1439
01:12:53.832 --> 01:12:56.850
This is for the kids. Gears. the kids.

1440
01:12:56.850 --> 01:12:58.740
Don't they deserve that much?

1441
01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:03.363
Look. brother. we're stronger
together than we are apart.

1442
01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:06.970
You don't want change and it's fine.

1443
01:13:06.970 --> 01:13:10.563
Just go sell that shit in
Beverly Hills. Calabasas.

1444
01:13:11.563 --> 01:13:15.700
No. no. don't poison our streets.

1445
01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:17.440
No. not the same streets

1446
01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:21.940
that our mothers and our
fathers worked and worked

1447
01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:23.473
so hard for us.

1448
01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:27.497
Just think about it. Gears.

1449
01:13:29.242 --> 01:13:30.492
Think about it.

1450
01:13:38.330 --> 01:13:40.140
- Let me tell you something. Deandre.

1451
01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:41.707
next time you pull that motherfucker.

1452
01:13:41.707 --> 01:13:43.957
you better sure ass use it.

1453
01:13:45.893 --> 01:13:48.226
(rap music)

1454
01:13:55.930 --> 01:13:57.770
- What's up. gangsta?

1455
01:13:57.770 --> 01:13:59.700
- Ain't no gangsta around here. Toyo.

1456
01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:01.247
- You take care of that
shit I asked you to do?

1457
01:14:01.247 --> 01:14:02.720
- [Male] You got something for me?

1458
01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:03.573
- Absolutely.

1459
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:09.970
- You don't have to
count it. it's all there.

1460
01:14:09.970 --> 01:14:11.140
Hey Beavis.

1461
01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:13.580
I need you to take care
of something else for me.

1462
01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:15.670
There's someone staying at
the Tresswood apartments

1463
01:14:15.670 --> 01:14:18.950
on 79th and Central. apartment six.

1464
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:21.036
Same deal. we cool?

1465
01:14:21.036 --> 01:14:21.869
- Now what the fuck we gonna do

1466
01:14:21.869 --> 01:14:23.070
about the community activists?

1467
01:14:23.070 --> 01:14:24.736
- What about 'em? Who
gives a shit about them?

1468
01:14:24.736 --> 01:14:26.150
- Pretty soon we'll put a stop to them?

1469
01:14:26.150 --> 01:14:27.810
We all gonna be out of business.

1470
01:14:27.810 --> 01:14:29.960
- Fuck those guys. all
right. I'll take care of it.

1471
01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:31.610
- Yep. all right. so will I.

1472
01:14:31.610 --> 01:14:32.863
- Now get outta here.

1473
01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:41.740
- [Marcus] Yo Mr. M.

1474
01:14:44.150 --> 01:14:47.027
Yo Mr. M. can I holla at you for a second?

1475
01:14:47.027 --> 01:14:48.260
- Yeah. yeah.

1476
01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:49.093
What's going on. Marcus?

1477
01:14:49.093 --> 01:14:49.926
How you doing man?

1478
01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:52.893
- Somebody got shot
again in my neighborhood.

1479
01:14:54.170 --> 01:14:56.033
Somebody I went to middle school with.

1480
01:14:57.758 --> 01:14:59.108
I'm sick of this shit. man.

1481
01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:01.490
All we do is kill each other.

1482
01:15:02.895 --> 01:15:03.728
Why we can't be united

1483
01:15:03.728 --> 01:15:05.780
like the Latinos and the other races?

1484
01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:08.630
Why every day I walk to
school. I got to watch my back

1485
01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:10.480
or when a police car drives beside me

1486
01:15:11.401 --> 01:15:13.163
I'm scared for my life?

1487
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:15.463
I'm tired.

1488
01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:19.200
We ain't got no solutions.

1489
01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:20.060
- Yes we do.

1490
01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:21.290
- And what's that?

1491
01:15:21.290 --> 01:15:22.810
I hope it ain't sports.

1492
01:15:22.810 --> 01:15:24.203
Kaepernick took that knee.

1493
01:15:25.140 --> 01:15:27.900
all the other athletes we look
up to. they ain't do nothing.

1494
01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:29.500
So I know that ain't the answer.

1495
01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:32.160
What's the solution?

1496
01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:34.823
- The solution is you.

1497
01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:37.240
- Me?

1498
01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:38.593
- Yes. Marcus. you.

1499
01:15:39.610 --> 01:15:41.030
- How?

1500
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.863
I ain't got no-

1501
01:15:41.863 --> 01:15:42.863
- Stop right there.

1502
01:15:43.950 --> 01:15:44.930
Yes. you do.

1503
01:15:44.930 --> 01:15:46.560
You have all of the power.

1504
01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:49.810
And it's that same mentality
of not having power

1505
01:15:49.810 --> 01:15:51.483
that makes us feel like we don't.

1506
01:15:53.532 --> 01:15:58.532
Think about it. Marcus.
your voice is power.

1507
01:16:00.620 --> 01:16:02.720
Didn't you come to my
classroom the other day.

1508
01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:05.283
venting to me about what is power?

1509
01:16:06.230 --> 01:16:07.063
- Yeah.

1510
01:16:08.450 --> 01:16:12.070
- The power is in you and
nobody. and I mean nobody.

1511
01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:13.632
can take that from you.

1512
01:16:13.632 --> 01:16:15.049
Do you know that?

1513
01:16:16.239 --> 01:16:17.610
- Who cares about them celebrities.

1514
01:16:17.610 --> 01:16:20.040
the millionaires. them sellouts?

1515
01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:22.260
You don't have to worry about them.

1516
01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:24.893
Millionaire or not.
ballplayer. football player.

1517
01:16:26.785 --> 01:16:29.480
they don't control us.

1518
01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:30.570
They don't control what we want to do.

1519
01:16:30.570 --> 01:16:32.890
When you want change. you can make change.

1520
01:16:32.890 --> 01:16:33.723
You hear me?

1521
01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:36.030
As long as you have a goal.

1522
01:16:36.030 --> 01:16:38.190
as long as you see something
that nobody can take from you

1523
01:16:38.190 --> 01:16:39.263
it is your vision.

1524
01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.600
You just have to see it through.

1525
01:16:43.847 --> 01:16:46.160
- So you think I got a shot at this?

1526
01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:48.443
- I know you have a shot at this. Marcus.

1527
01:16:49.749 --> 01:16:51.999
(knocking)

1528
01:16:52.849 --> 01:16:55.083
- I'm looking for Messiah.

1529
01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:57.960
- That'll be me.

1530
01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:01.936
All right. Marcus. get home. all right?

1531
01:17:01.936 --> 01:17:03.650
I don't need your dad calling me.

1532
01:17:03.650 --> 01:17:05.900
(laughing)

1533
01:17:08.224 --> 01:17:10.227
- Hi. I don't mean to bother you.

1534
01:17:10.227 --> 01:17:13.077
but I heard I could find you
here from that reporter guy.

1535
01:17:14.084 --> 01:17:15.313
Thomas Sheldon.

1536
01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:18.750
Nevermind. I didn't mean to disturb you-

1537
01:17:18.750 --> 01:17:20.663
- No. no. you can sit right here.

1538
01:17:31.530 --> 01:17:32.363
What's going on?

1539
01:17:32.363 --> 01:17:33.323
What brings you here?

1540
01:17:34.575 --> 01:17:38.883
- Well. I think I know who killed Celeste.

1541
01:17:44.666 --> 01:17:47.733
- Anything you need from us.
Ms. Porter. you let us know.

1542
01:17:48.983 --> 01:17:52.390
- There's just so much shit going on.

1543
01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:53.790
And I don't even know what I'mma do

1544
01:17:53.790 --> 01:17:55.340
about the funeral arrangements.

1545
01:17:59.253 --> 01:18:01.490
- This should cover everything

1546
01:18:01.490 --> 01:18:03.363
far as the funeral arrangements.

1547
01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:06.970
A civil suit has been
filed against the LAPD

1548
01:18:06.970 --> 01:18:08.193
for their misconduct.

1549
01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:12.007
Justice will be served.

1550
01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:15.030
Now. when you get settled in-

1551
01:18:15.030 --> 01:18:17.250
- [Female] We need you outside
right now. it's Khalid.

1552
01:18:17.250 --> 01:18:18.083
Let's go!

1553
01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:22.313
- You like that?

1554
01:18:22.313 --> 01:18:23.405
- That's the best you got?

1555
01:18:23.405 --> 01:18:24.616
- Well no. I've got more.

1556
01:18:24.616 --> 01:18:26.089
You like that?

1557
01:18:26.089 --> 01:18:28.039
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1558
01:18:28.039 --> 01:18:30.026
- [Male] That's bullshit.

1559
01:18:30.026 --> 01:18:30.859
he ain't even do nothing.

1560
01:18:30.859 --> 01:18:32.350
Racist mother fucker.

1561
01:18:32.350 --> 01:18:33.664
- 400 years of captivity

1562
01:18:33.664 --> 01:18:35.510
and y'all still slugging like bitches.

1563
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:36.558
- Oh yeah?

1564
01:18:36.558 --> 01:18:40.391
How 'bout this one. and
this one and this one?

1565
01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:43.570
I'm gonna fuck up that other eye of yours.

1566
01:18:43.570 --> 01:18:44.720
- Guess without that white hood on

1567
01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:46.597
you lost your superpowers. huh?

1568
01:18:46.597 --> 01:18:47.950
- Bet you if he was white.

1569
01:18:47.950 --> 01:18:49.640
you wouldn't do that stupid shit.

1570
01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:51.410
- Hey. the more he talks.
the worse it's getting.

1571
01:18:51.410 --> 01:18:53.327
- Fuck you. Tell this fucking
bitch to shut the fuck up.

1572
01:18:56.192 --> 01:18:57.859
- He gonna kill him.

1573
01:18:58.900 --> 01:18:59.985
You're killing him.

1574
01:18:59.985 --> 01:19:01.197
- You listen to me-

1575
01:19:01.197 --> 01:19:03.537
- [Male] Fuck you. you
black asshole. do something.

1576
01:19:03.537 --> 01:19:05.704
- [Male] Shut the fuck up.

1577
01:19:08.850 --> 01:19:09.967
- You like that. huh?

1578
01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:13.710
How'd you like to catch some hell

1579
01:19:13.710 --> 01:19:15.923
and hang your fucking black ass?

1580
01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:18.690
- One thing about hell.

1581
01:19:18.690 --> 01:19:20.660
you drive past that shit every day.

1582
01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:21.950
I live in it.

1583
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:25.291
You avoid the dance with
the devil. I welcome it.

1584
01:19:25.291 --> 01:19:26.124
(laughing)

1585
01:19:26.124 --> 01:19:28.310
- You are one fucking crazy mother fucker.

1586
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:29.993
Get the fuck over there.

1587
01:19:31.056 --> 01:19:34.010
- When I'm fucking through with you-

1588
01:19:34.010 --> 01:19:35.333
- What are you gonna do?

1589
01:19:35.333 --> 01:19:36.650
You ain't gonna do fucking shit. huh?

1590
01:19:36.650 --> 01:19:37.483
What are you gonna do?

1591
01:19:37.483 --> 01:19:38.870
You gonna fucking sue me?

1592
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:40.040
For what?

1593
01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:42.520
For excessive force on
a resisting suspect?

1594
01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:43.810
Yeah. is that what you gonna do?

1595
01:19:43.810 --> 01:19:46.270
Good. go ahead. we'll go to court.

1596
01:19:46.270 --> 01:19:49.120
You might even when your
fucking bullshit lawsuit.

1597
01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:51.230
going to get a few
dollars. but guess what?

1598
01:19:51.230 --> 01:19:53.660
The motherfucking money's
coming right back to me

1599
01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:55.360
because they're gonna suspend me

1600
01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:59.170
and a suspension means I get full pay.

1601
01:19:59.170 --> 01:20:01.240
So please fucking sue me.

1602
01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:02.833
I need a fucking vacation.

1603
01:20:03.793 --> 01:20:05.843
- A bird only can fly in the sky so long.

1604
01:20:06.759 --> 01:20:07.730
Sooner or later he gotta come down

1605
01:20:07.730 --> 01:20:10.210
for food and water. mother fucker.

1606
01:20:10.210 --> 01:20:11.097
- What the fuck does that mean?

1607
01:20:11.097 --> 01:20:13.767
All you guys are all fucking crazy.

1608
01:20:13.767 --> 01:20:15.280
You now what. fuck it.
I'm gonna let him go.

1609
01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:16.163
This is bullshit.

1610
01:20:18.222 --> 01:20:23.222
All right tough guy.
here clean yourself up.

1611
01:20:25.450 --> 01:20:26.283
- Officer.

1612
01:20:28.181 --> 01:20:29.681
- He just won't quit. will he?

1613
01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:31.923
Yeah. what's up?

1614
01:20:33.228 --> 01:20:35.040
- Pick a card real quick.

1615
01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:35.873
- You serious?

1616
01:20:37.933 --> 01:20:38.766
All right.

1617
01:20:40.610 --> 01:20:42.980
- [Khalid] You see a card?
- Yeah. I see it.

1618
01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:44.553
You're gonna find it now for me?

1619
01:20:46.150 --> 01:20:47.593
- [Khalid] Is this your card?

1620
01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:51.080
- Uh. no it's not.

1621
01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:53.593
- Oops. (laughing)

1622
01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:56.603
Oh shit.
- You got some problems.

1623
01:20:59.490 --> 01:21:00.383
I like that guy.

1624
01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:18.463
- I want Cooper.

1625
01:21:21.630 --> 01:21:23.290
- Yeah. you and me both.

1626
01:21:23.290 --> 01:21:25.530
All right. I've been trying
to get the Cooper for years.

1627
01:21:25.530 --> 01:21:27.360
It's like trying to get to the president.

1628
01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:28.750
just forget it.

1629
01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:30.100
- He can be touched.

1630
01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:31.180
You and I both know that.

1631
01:21:31.180 --> 01:21:32.810
You've seen what happened to Jane.

1632
01:21:32.810 --> 01:21:34.430
- Yes. I'm not doubting it.

1633
01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:37.070
It's the consequences
that come if he's touched.

1634
01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:39.110
All right. he's tied in. he's too tied in.

1635
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:43.186
He's tied in with the Rugazzi's.
the cartels. politicians.

1636
01:21:43.186 --> 01:21:44.610
All right. if Cooper goes down.

1637
01:21:44.610 --> 01:21:47.470
a lot of people lose protection and money

1638
01:21:47.470 --> 01:21:49.370
and you don't need that
kind of attention right now.

1639
01:21:49.370 --> 01:21:51.180
- Can you help or not?

1640
01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:52.990
- I'm doing my best.

1641
01:21:52.990 --> 01:21:55.180
- I don't need you to do your best.

1642
01:21:55.180 --> 01:21:57.114
I need that shit done.

1643
01:21:57.114 --> 01:21:57.947
You hear me?

1644
01:21:57.947 --> 01:21:59.666
- Messiah. listen to me.

1645
01:21:59.666 --> 01:22:02.460
Just (phone buzzing)

1646
01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:05.210
be patient when it comes to Cooper.

1647
01:22:05.210 --> 01:22:06.043
- Talk to me.

1648
01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:12.653
What?

1649
01:22:16.033 --> 01:22:17.573
All right. I'm on my way.

1650
01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:22.653
- What is it?

1651
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:28.870
Hey. hey. hey. talk to
me. what's going on?

1652
01:22:30.210 --> 01:22:31.510
- There was a little girl.

1653
01:22:33.648 --> 01:22:36.773
She was just shot and murdered
in an apartment on Central.

1654
01:22:39.586 --> 01:22:41.263
- All right. what can I do?

1655
01:22:42.718 --> 01:22:46.463
- It's never gonna stop
until we make it stop.

1656
01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:50.903
- Get me Cooper.

1657
01:23:03.461 --> 01:23:05.223
- Is it done?

1658
01:23:05.223 --> 01:23:06.056
What'd I fucking tell you?

1659
01:23:06.056 --> 01:23:06.889
Get it done.

1660
01:23:06.889 --> 01:23:07.722
Get it fucking done. huh?

1661
01:23:13.351 --> 01:23:14.768
- Hey Mr. Cooper.

1662
01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:20.973
Well. you know. you've been
playing your music way too loud.

1663
01:23:23.126 --> 01:23:24.950
I think it's time you
bring it all the way down.

1664
01:23:26.565 --> 01:23:28.610
- Oh yeah. why's that?

1665
01:23:28.610 --> 01:23:30.293
- 'Cause it's bad for business.

1666
01:23:31.130 --> 01:23:34.463
And if it's bad for our
business. it's bad for you.

1667
01:23:36.041 --> 01:23:38.810
- Oh you guys are a fucking
joke. you know that?

1668
01:23:38.810 --> 01:23:40.780
I know for a fact that the Russians

1669
01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:43.460
kicked your asses out of New
York last year. all right?

1670
01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:44.293
So don't try any

1671
01:23:44.293 --> 01:23:47.750
of that fucking grease bowl
guinea shit with me. okay?

1672
01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:50.430
And I don't give a fuck what you spicks

1673
01:23:50.430 --> 01:23:52.150
or what you fucking guineas do

1674
01:23:52.150 --> 01:23:55.630
in New York. Vegas. Mexico.
wherever the fuck you come from.

1675
01:23:55.630 --> 01:23:58.040
and in LA I call the shots. capisch?

1676
01:23:58.040 --> 01:23:59.368
Now fuck off.

1677
01:23:59.368 --> 01:24:01.510
- How the fuck. you come
in here and disrespect me

1678
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:03.350
in my fucking place.

1679
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:04.670
I'll cut your fucking eyeballs out

1680
01:24:04.670 --> 01:24:08.391
and eat 'em like grapes.
you mother fucker.

1681
01:24:08.391 --> 01:24:09.224
Fuck him!

1682
01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:11.420
Turn me loose.

1683
01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:12.463
Turn me loose.

1684
01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:17.023
- Hold on. Mr. Rugazzi. I apologize.

1685
01:24:18.090 --> 01:24:20.210
No disrespect. it's a long day out there.

1686
01:24:20.210 --> 01:24:21.572
- Fucking sorry.

1687
01:24:21.572 --> 01:24:23.060
Do me a favor. okay. Cooper.

1688
01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:24.290
when you go out there be careful.

1689
01:24:24.290 --> 01:24:26.090
it's fucking dangerous. you hear me?

1690
01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:29.070
Do me another favor.

1691
01:24:29.070 --> 01:24:31.300
get the fuck outta here.

1692
01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:32.927
Get him out of here!

1693
01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:39.770
- A fucking little girl. Messiah.

1694
01:24:39.770 --> 01:24:41.950
Whoever did this shit has
to be dealt with tonight.

1695
01:24:41.950 --> 01:24:43.050
- He's right. Messiah.

1696
01:24:43.050 --> 01:24:45.230
This shit. this shit got to stop.

1697
01:24:45.230 --> 01:24:48.180
- She was seven years old.

1698
01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:49.843
Only fucking seven.

1699
01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:54.200
- We can't. we can't strike right now.

1700
01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:55.752
- Fuck that.
- What the fuck?

1701
01:24:55.752 --> 01:24:56.726
Fuck that.

1702
01:24:56.726 --> 01:24:59.423
- Then what do you suggest Khalid. huh?

1703
01:24:59.423 --> 01:25:01.313
Since you know every damn thing.

1704
01:25:02.350 --> 01:25:06.510
Reacting right now will
only draw heat to us.

1705
01:25:06.510 --> 01:25:11.510
Look. we have to be calm and strategic.

1706
01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:15.120
- Man. fuck all that.

1707
01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:17.860
You act like we cops trying
to blow our fucking cover.

1708
01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:20.060
This shit don't make
no motherfucking sense.

1709
01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:20.910
We're sitting here

1710
01:25:20.910 --> 01:25:21.743
and while we sitting here.

1711
01:25:21.743 --> 01:25:23.790
ain't shit getting done.

1712
01:25:23.790 --> 01:25:26.490
This whole Silva-Kahn.
Martin Luther King bullshit

1713
01:25:26.490 --> 01:25:28.390
is really starting to
get fucking played out

1714
01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:29.610
and I'm tired of it.

1715
01:25:29.610 --> 01:25:31.430
They don't understand peace. Messiah.

1716
01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:33.490
It's either kill or be killed.

1717
01:25:33.490 --> 01:25:34.670
I keep telling you that.

1718
01:25:34.670 --> 01:25:36.240
they only understand violence.

1719
01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:37.700
So what the fuck are you gonna do?

1720
01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:42.530
- See. this by all means
necessary attitude shit you have.

1721
01:25:42.530 --> 01:25:44.260
you know what it's gonna
do for you. Khalid?

1722
01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:45.337
- What?

1723
01:25:45.337 --> 01:25:46.460
- It's gonna get you killed.

1724
01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:48.084
And then what?

1725
01:25:48.084 --> 01:25:49.050
Hmm. then what?

1726
01:25:49.050 --> 01:25:51.720
- It's gonna make me a
dead motherfucking man

1727
01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:53.540
who fought for justice.

1728
01:25:53.540 --> 01:25:56.380
- No. you died a nigger who died

1729
01:25:56.380 --> 01:25:58.870
before his purpose was fulfilled.

1730
01:25:58.870 --> 01:26:03.870
You died an overreacting. emotional fool.

1731
01:26:04.287 --> 01:26:07.690
We have to be calm and strategic.

1732
01:26:07.690 --> 01:26:08.790
That's all I'm saying.

1733
01:26:12.410 --> 01:26:16.743
- Calm and strategic is your fucking job.

1734
01:26:19.152 --> 01:26:23.830
Retribution is mine. nigger.

1735
01:26:35.212 --> 01:26:37.212
(yells)

1736
01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:40.860
- You know they have a saying.

1737
01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:45.540
they say when going through obstacles

1738
01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:49.003
God gives the devil permission to test us.

1739
01:26:51.230 --> 01:26:52.830
Some people shouldn't be tested.

1740
01:26:54.542 --> 01:26:56.875
(crosstalk)

1741
01:27:12.170 --> 01:27:14.380
- Who you staring at. nigger?

1742
01:27:15.393 --> 01:27:16.226
Shit boy.

1743
01:27:17.681 --> 01:27:21.848
You know. you've always
paying too much attention.

1744
01:27:25.390 --> 01:27:28.939
Go get us another eight ball. nigger.

1745
01:27:28.939 --> 01:27:31.683
Tell him boss man sent you.

1746
01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:38.143
Don't watch me.

1747
01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:41.247
Watch your step.

1748
01:27:43.425 --> 01:27:45.203
- [Male] Every little step I take.

1749
01:27:45.203 --> 01:27:46.411
- Yeah. nigger.

1750
01:27:46.411 --> 01:27:51.411
(dramatic music)
(knocking)

1751
01:27:56.255 --> 01:27:58.922
(ominous music)

1752
01:28:08.709 --> 01:28:10.451
- It's late. man.

1753
01:28:10.451 --> 01:28:12.972
You looking for somebody or what?

1754
01:28:12.972 --> 01:28:15.639
(ominous music)

1755
01:29:32.570 --> 01:29:34.086
- [Male] Hey man. I tried to call you-

1756
01:29:34.086 --> 01:29:35.280
- [Male] Where the fuck
is she. mother fucker?

1757
01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:36.642
- [Male] Hey man.

1758
01:29:36.642 --> 01:29:37.857
I know you told me not to
come around here no more man

1759
01:29:37.857 --> 01:29:39.170
but two dudes killed her.

1760
01:29:39.170 --> 01:29:40.003
- What?

1761
01:29:40.003 --> 01:29:41.010
- [Male] There was a dude with long hair

1762
01:29:41.010 --> 01:29:42.910
and short hair. man I seen it.

1763
01:29:42.910 --> 01:29:44.674
- The fuck you talking about. nigger?

1764
01:29:44.674 --> 01:29:46.220
- [Male] Hey man. two
dudes killed her. man.

1765
01:29:46.220 --> 01:29:47.984
- [Male] They killed her. man.

1766
01:29:47.984 --> 01:29:50.817
- I'm sorry. man. it was
two dudes. man. I'm sorry.

1767
01:29:50.817 --> 01:29:54.517
I'm sorry man. they left a blue rose man.

1768
01:29:54.517 --> 01:29:56.929
- What?
- A blue rose. man.

1769
01:29:56.929 --> 01:29:57.762
- Get the fuck out.

1770
01:30:06.613 --> 01:30:08.050
(pounding)

1771
01:30:08.050 --> 01:30:08.883
Fuck!

1772
01:30:24.404 --> 01:30:27.280
- I'm guessing you're not
here to check on my health.

1773
01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:29.513
What is it. my time now?

1774
01:30:32.290 --> 01:30:34.140
- I need you to find somebody for me.

1775
01:30:37.060 --> 01:30:38.840
- Does Messiah know about this?

1776
01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:41.329
- Messiah ain't got shit to do with this.

1777
01:30:41.329 --> 01:30:42.680
this ain't Council business.

1778
01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:43.543
This is personal.

1779
01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:48.739
- All right. okay. I can help.

1780
01:30:48.739 --> 01:30:50.720
- And do you got access to
police files and records

1781
01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:51.920
and all that other shit?

1782
01:30:52.900 --> 01:30:54.083
- Yeah. I got a guy.

1783
01:30:55.780 --> 01:30:57.130
- Well I'mma need that too.

1784
01:31:00.610 --> 01:31:02.757
- Call him and tell
him what's gonna happen

1785
01:31:02.757 --> 01:31:04.613
and we'll meet on Thursday.

1786
01:31:12.450 --> 01:31:13.803
- I got a big problem.

1787
01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:16.663
And I came down here

1788
01:31:16.663 --> 01:31:18.890
to get your permission to take care of it.

1789
01:31:18.890 --> 01:31:22.033
- Messiah. you don't need my permission.

1790
01:31:23.650 --> 01:31:24.750
- With this one. I do.

1791
01:31:28.030 --> 01:31:30.143
- Is it business or personal?

1792
01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:37.153
- Both.

1793
01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:45.113
- Look Messiah. if I know
you like I think I know you.

1794
01:31:46.163 --> 01:31:48.363
you've got the situation
under full control.

1795
01:31:49.650 --> 01:31:53.810
but I would consider it a personal favor

1796
01:31:53.810 --> 01:31:56.510
if you would ask for my help
regarding this situation.

1797
01:31:57.930 --> 01:32:01.203
You just give me the word
and we'll take care of it.

1798
01:32:02.370 --> 01:32:04.800
- I need this favor. Papa Rugazzi.

1799
01:32:05.650 --> 01:32:09.123
This is the only way I
can make things right.

1800
01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:17.163
- Consider it done.

1801
01:32:23.559 --> 01:32:25.260
- Where the fuck we going now. Mickey?

1802
01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:26.980
- What do you think. Cooper?

1803
01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:29.240
Taking out some trash for Rugazzi.

1804
01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:30.270
- Oh fuck another one?

1805
01:32:30.270 --> 01:32:31.650
Jesus Christ. you Guinea assholes

1806
01:32:31.650 --> 01:32:33.260
kill more people than the United States.

1807
01:32:33.260 --> 01:32:35.310
- Hey. we just take it
out the fucking trash

1808
01:32:35.310 --> 01:32:37.170
like usual. you know?

1809
01:32:37.170 --> 01:32:39.230
- Who's this motherfucker?

1810
01:32:39.230 --> 01:32:43.410
- Mr. Rugazzi's cousin
from Vancouver. Parly.

1811
01:32:43.410 --> 01:32:45.570
- Yeah. I'm fucking Parly from Vancouver.

1812
01:32:45.570 --> 01:32:47.280
You got a fucking problem pig?

1813
01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:48.113
- Yeah. I do.

1814
01:32:48.113 --> 01:32:50.300
The last thing I need is
another fucking wise guy wannabe

1815
01:32:50.300 --> 01:32:51.260
in my town.

1816
01:32:51.260 --> 01:32:52.093
- The fuck. wise guy?

1817
01:32:52.093 --> 01:32:55.060
Who the fuck you calling
wise guy. mother fucker?

1818
01:32:55.060 --> 01:32:55.923
You're fucking-

1819
01:33:02.858 --> 01:33:06.030
- [Parly] Watch it. that's
my fucking shoulder.

1820
01:33:06.030 --> 01:33:07.916
- [Marco] Shut the fuck up. Parly.

1821
01:33:07.916 --> 01:33:09.980
- [Parly] Holy shit. Marco. watch it.

1822
01:33:09.980 --> 01:33:11.230
Mickey. Mickey.

1823
01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:13.215
- Give me the fucking gun.

1824
01:33:13.215 --> 01:33:14.715
I got shit to do.

1825
01:33:15.573 --> 01:33:18.458
- Mickey. Mickey. fuck!
- Shut up.

1826
01:33:18.458 --> 01:33:19.291
- You know what?

1827
01:33:19.291 --> 01:33:20.124
I'm gonna kill this fucking-

1828
01:33:20.124 --> 01:33:21.350
- [Parly] Mickey. Mickey.

1829
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:23.497
- Shut up.
- What the fuck is this?

1830
01:33:23.497 --> 01:33:26.492
What this. a thank you card?

1831
01:33:26.492 --> 01:33:29.409
(gunfire blasting)

1832
01:33:30.608 --> 01:33:32.093
I'm sorry. you mother fucker.

1833
01:33:33.713 --> 01:33:34.546
- Remember me?

1834
01:33:34.546 --> 01:33:35.379
- What the fuck?

1835
01:33:35.379 --> 01:33:37.014
- You can't avoid this dance
with the devil. mother fucker.

1836
01:33:37.014 --> 01:33:40.014
(gunfire blasting)

1837
01:33:43.130 --> 01:33:47.270
- Alright. y'all get the body. okay.

1838
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:49.070
we'll take care of the rest.

1839
01:33:49.070 --> 01:33:50.782
- Mr. Rugazzi said that-

1840
01:33:50.782 --> 01:33:53.980
- Look. I don't give a fuck
what Mr. Rugazzi said. okay?

1841
01:33:53.980 --> 01:33:57.313
Both of you get the fuck up out of here.

1842
01:33:58.573 --> 01:34:02.613
- All right. tough guy. it's your funeral.

1843
01:34:04.065 --> 01:34:04.903
Let's get out of here. Marco.

1844
01:34:18.270 --> 01:34:21.253
- Jesus Christ. this can't be real.

1845
01:34:22.610 --> 01:34:24.260
Who would do something like this?

1846
01:34:25.290 --> 01:34:28.373
- Someone who's trying
to send us a message.

1847
01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:31.353
- Exactly what I said.

1848
01:34:32.230 --> 01:34:34.140
Bums didn't see nothing.

1849
01:34:34.140 --> 01:34:35.740
trail riders didn't see nothing.

1850
01:34:36.590 --> 01:34:39.670
almost as if it was done execution style.

1851
01:34:39.670 --> 01:34:42.580
as if it was deserved.

1852
01:34:42.580 --> 01:34:45.175
- What are you implying detective?

1853
01:34:45.175 --> 01:34:50.175
- Whoever did this made it
personal. real personal.

1854
01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:53.080
And this was done only about
20 yards away from where

1855
01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:55.963
Tyler Williams was killed.

1856
01:34:56.930 --> 01:34:58.690
- Tyler Williams?

1857
01:34:58.690 --> 01:35:00.637
- Yeah that piece of shit
that killed that little girl

1858
01:35:00.637 --> 01:35:02.880
and put her mother in a coma.

1859
01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:05.163
His street name is Devious.

1860
01:35:06.079 --> 01:35:08.330
- Dead detective being shot up and hung

1861
01:35:08.330 --> 01:35:09.920
in the wake of all this.

1862
01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:11.420
it's not a good look.

1863
01:35:11.420 --> 01:35:12.420
- Exactly.

1864
01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:15.410
And whatever was done behind closed doors.

1865
01:35:15.410 --> 01:35:17.653
well. they got to Cooper before we did.

1866
01:35:27.678 --> 01:35:30.140
- Collect the knife and the card

1867
01:35:30.140 --> 01:35:31.740
and put it in your evidence bag.

1868
01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:42.320
- I wonder why the card?

1869
01:35:43.684 --> 01:35:45.223
What was the meaning to it?

1870
01:35:46.439 --> 01:35:47.320
- It means something is on the way

1871
01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:49.043
that we need to be prepared for.

1872
01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:29.450
- Come on Messiah. pick up.

1873
01:36:31.097 --> 01:36:33.000
Oh shit. come on. pick up.

1874
01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.500
God damn it. Messiah. pick up.

1875
01:36:36.151 --> 01:36:36.984
Fuck.

1876
01:36:41.290 --> 01:36:42.123
Messiah!

1877
01:36:43.753 --> 01:36:45.350
Messiah!

1878
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:47.111
Messiah. are you here?

1879
01:36:47.111 --> 01:36:47.944
Messiah!

1880
01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:52.728
Messiah!

1881
01:36:52.728 --> 01:36:54.787
Messiah. yo!

1882
01:36:54.787 --> 01:36:55.620
Messiah!

1883
01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:58.483
- [Lucren] Everything all right?

1884
01:36:58.483 --> 01:37:03.213
- Lucren. yeah. yeah
everything's fine. man.

1885
01:37:04.886 --> 01:37:06.640
Messiah's not around. is he?

1886
01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:08.440
- He stepped out.

1887
01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:10.400
Can I take a message for you?

1888
01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:13.904
- No. no. don't worry about it.

1889
01:37:13.904 --> 01:37:16.952
He had me look in to something for him

1890
01:37:16.952 --> 01:37:19.452
and it turned out to be a
dead end so no big deal.

1891
01:37:20.758 --> 01:37:21.591
You don't mind if I smoke. do you?

1892
01:37:21.591 --> 01:37:23.563
- Go right ahead.

1893
01:37:25.810 --> 01:37:29.053
- You now what. I left my
matchbook book at home so.

1894
01:37:31.825 --> 01:37:34.233
- Just a coincidence. I got one.

1895
01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:37.153
- Thank you.

1896
01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:43.420
You don't mind if I wait
around for him. do you?

1897
01:37:43.420 --> 01:37:44.253
- Not at all.

1898
01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:48.273
You see any of the work
we've done with the kids?

1899
01:37:49.330 --> 01:37:51.233
- Yeah. yeah. yeah I have.

1900
01:37:53.091 --> 01:37:54.110
It's some really great work

1901
01:37:54.110 --> 01:37:56.260
that you guys are doing
for your community.

1902
01:37:59.410 --> 01:38:01.813
You should be be proud of yourself.

1903
01:38:02.750 --> 01:38:05.280
- Yeah it's revolutionary stuff.

1904
01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:07.420
The kids have never had
so many black super heroes

1905
01:38:07.420 --> 01:38:08.263
to look up to.

1906
01:38:12.025 --> 01:38:14.358
(cocks gun)

1907
01:38:16.869 --> 01:38:19.690
(jazz music)

1908
01:38:19.690 --> 01:38:21.040
- Song sound familiar. huh?

1909
01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:25.543
I been waiting on this
all my life. all my life.

1910
01:38:27.430 --> 01:38:28.880
Thought you would have been dead right now

1911
01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:32.500
but just to my prayers.
your ass still alive.

1912
01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:34.957
Remember me. huh. mother fucker?

1913
01:38:39.417 --> 01:38:41.167
Hey. what y'all doing to my sister?

1914
01:38:42.704 --> 01:38:44.300
- Didn't we send you to the store?

1915
01:38:44.300 --> 01:38:45.452
- What y'all doing?

1916
01:38:45.452 --> 01:38:47.154
(grunting)

1917
01:38:47.154 --> 01:38:48.590
Let me go.

1918
01:38:48.590 --> 01:38:50.387
- [Male] Hold his ass down. man.

1919
01:38:50.387 --> 01:38:52.130
Didn't I tell you about
watching your eyes.

1920
01:38:52.130 --> 01:38:53.667
huh pretty Tony?

1921
01:38:53.667 --> 01:38:54.688
Didn't I tell you?

1922
01:38:54.688 --> 01:38:56.550
You want to pay attention to so much. huh.

1923
01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:58.050
nigger. pay attention to this.

1924
01:39:00.090 --> 01:39:01.880
Don't watch me. watch your eyes.

1925
01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:03.290
Don't watch me. watch your step.

1926
01:39:03.290 --> 01:39:06.200
Watch your eyes. watch
your eyes. watch your eyes.

1927
01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:08.460
You see this shit. huh?

1928
01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:09.293
No?

1929
01:39:10.528 --> 01:39:11.617
This for Haley. motherfucker.

1930
01:39:11.617 --> 01:39:14.534
(gunfire blasting)

1931
01:39:23.135 --> 01:39:24.782
- Let's get out of here. Tony.

1932
01:39:24.782 --> 01:39:26.802
- No I think I'mma stay.

1933
01:39:26.802 --> 01:39:28.106
- You sure?

1934
01:39:28.106 --> 01:39:30.786
(dog barking)

1935
01:39:30.786 --> 01:39:33.619
(liquid sloshing)

1936
01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:42.600
- Hey boss. man.

1937
01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:44.972

1938
01:39:44.972 --> 01:39:48.353

1939
01:39:49.633 --> 01:39:52.050
(jazz music)

1940
01:40:13.310 --> 01:40:14.320
- Papa Rugazzi.

1941
01:40:17.687 --> 01:40:22.363
- Listen Messiah. we have a
serious issue on our hands.

1942
01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:26.933
Because I love you like a son
and respect you like a man.

1943
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:30.330
I'm gonna give you the
opportunity of fixing this.

1944
01:40:32.050 --> 01:40:35.963
But if you can't get it
done. I will get it done.

1945
01:40:38.990 --> 01:40:40.420
- What's the problem?

1946
01:40:40.420 --> 01:40:42.070
- What's the problem?

1947
01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:44.080
Kidnapping old men and burning them alive.

1948
01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:45.960
that's the fucking problem.

1949
01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:47.663
It's drawing too much attention.

1950
01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:50.420
And we talked about attention.

1951
01:40:53.410 --> 01:40:55.550
He's out of control.

1952
01:40:55.550 --> 01:40:57.520
He's too fucking loud.

1953
01:40:57.520 --> 01:40:59.283
And he needs to be silenced.

1954
01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:02.223
Plus. he murdered my best guy.

1955
01:41:03.190 --> 01:41:04.150
You know that gang member

1956
01:41:04.150 --> 01:41:06.410
that killed that little
seven year old girl?

1957
01:41:06.410 --> 01:41:08.626
- Y'all know who y'all fucking with?

1958
01:41:08.626 --> 01:41:10.063
Papa Rugazzi.

1959
01:41:10.063 --> 01:41:12.730
Nigger. I got cops on the payroll.

1960
01:41:12.730 --> 01:41:15.062
Y'all niggers tripping over (mumbles)?

1961
01:41:15.062 --> 01:41:16.838
Nigger. (mumbles).

1962
01:41:16.838 --> 01:41:18.549
(gunfire blasting)

1963
01:41:18.549 --> 01:41:20.117
- I got a bullet for every one.

1964
01:41:20.117 --> 01:41:23.034
(gunfire blasting)

1965
01:41:24.140 --> 01:41:24.973
One of our own.

1966
01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:27.680
He wasn't one of ours. he was theirs.

1967
01:41:29.790 --> 01:41:31.710
- What about his body?

1968
01:41:31.710 --> 01:41:32.960
- Let the flies have him.

1969
01:41:36.645 --> 01:41:39.790
- Are you gonna have any
difficulty solving this problem?

1970
01:41:41.110 --> 01:41:41.943
- It's done.

1971
01:41:45.220 --> 01:41:46.070
- One more thing.

1972
01:41:47.382 --> 01:41:50.940
you know that Council Robin
Hood bullshit you got going on?

1973
01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:52.280
Let's terminate it.

1974
01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:53.670
It's scaring business.

1975
01:41:53.670 --> 01:41:56.593
And what's bad for business
is bad for the economy.

1976
01:41:58.080 --> 01:41:59.073
I want you to know that.

1977
01:41:59.073 --> 01:42:01.440
I want you to understand that.

1978
01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:02.290
- Of course I do.

1979
01:42:04.270 --> 01:42:06.543
It's always business. never personal.

1980
01:42:08.430 --> 01:42:10.330
So I take it this is our last meeting?

1981
01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:13.283
- Yeah. yes it is.

1982
01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:22.280
Hey Messiah. it's dangerous out there.

1983
01:42:22.430 --> 01:42:23.683
be careful. my son.

1984
01:42:25.460 --> 01:42:27.250
- You too. Papa Rugazzi.

1985
01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:42.320
- So he didn't have the
balls to come do it himself.

1986
01:42:43.710 --> 01:42:46.410
He could have sent East Side
Doc to come do that shit.

1987
01:42:49.085 --> 01:42:50.490
- [Mike] You know East Side Doc

1988
01:42:50.490 --> 01:42:52.023
couldn't do nothing like this.

1989
01:42:52.990 --> 01:42:54.777
He got too much respect for you.

1990
01:42:59.569 --> 01:43:01.359
So you heard?

1991
01:43:01.359 --> 01:43:02.640
- Yeah I heard. Mike.

1992
01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:04.370
You know. just cause I
can't see out of one eye

1993
01:43:04.370 --> 01:43:06.120
don't mean I don't see shit coming.

1994
01:43:07.660 --> 01:43:09.410
So let me ask you something though.

1995
01:43:14.860 --> 01:43:17.443
who ordered the hit on me. man?

1996
01:43:19.771 --> 01:43:21.133
- [Mike] Rugazzi.

1997
01:43:21.133 --> 01:43:23.383
(laughing)

1998
01:43:24.542 --> 01:43:27.292
- Messiah. Messiah. Messiah. man.

1999
01:43:28.624 --> 01:43:30.374
You know they got this saying. man.

2000
01:43:31.357 --> 01:43:35.270
that people aren't loyal
till they're needing you

2001
01:43:35.270 --> 01:43:37.960
and once their needs change.
so does their loyalty.

2002
01:43:39.133 --> 01:43:41.030
But I got to give it to you Mike though.

2003
01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:43.273
for having a heart to come do this shit.

2004
01:43:47.310 --> 01:43:50.047
So sure you don't want to pick a card.

2005
01:43:50.047 --> 01:43:52.897
one last time for old
time's sake. man. just one?

2006
01:43:54.580 --> 01:43:55.730
- [Mike] Not this time.

2007
01:44:04.130 --> 01:44:06.207
- Well. let's get on with it.

2008
01:44:08.163 --> 01:44:11.080
(gunfire blasting)

2009
01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:18.683
- Yeah. it's done.

2010
01:44:22.150 --> 01:44:22.983
All right.

2011
01:44:25.250 --> 01:44:26.793
Let's get the fuck outta here.

2012
01:44:33.623 --> 01:44:35.740
- [Lucren] Is everything all right?

2013
01:44:35.740 --> 01:44:38.623
- Yeah. yeah. everything's all right.

2014
01:44:40.189 --> 01:44:43.067
- I wanted to talk to you
real brief about something.

2015
01:44:44.158 --> 01:44:46.741
- What you want to talk about?

2016
01:44:47.660 --> 01:44:49.690
- Look Messiah. I know
you and the brothers

2017
01:44:49.690 --> 01:44:52.400
got something major y'all
doing and I want in.

2018
01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:55.590
All right. I know y'all are
out cleaning up the streets

2019
01:44:57.620 --> 01:44:58.653
and I want to help.

2020
01:44:59.970 --> 01:45:01.720
I want to be a part of the Council.

2021
01:45:03.213 --> 01:45:04.704
- The Council?

2022
01:45:04.704 --> 01:45:07.050
(laughing)

2023
01:45:07.050 --> 01:45:10.016
Brother. I don't know
what you're talking about.

2024
01:45:10.016 --> 01:45:12.810
but look. I do need you
to do to me a big favor.

2025
01:45:12.810 --> 01:45:13.643
- Anything.

2026
01:45:14.510 --> 01:45:17.570
- Tomorrow. meet with Caira in the a.m.

2027
01:45:17.570 --> 01:45:20.140
and makes sure you deposit
those funds from a fundraiser

2028
01:45:20.140 --> 01:45:21.490
into the community account.

2029
01:45:22.990 --> 01:45:24.271
- That's all?

2030
01:45:24.271 --> 01:45:25.603
- Yeah. that's all.

2031
01:45:28.340 --> 01:45:30.360
- Alright man. if you need
anything else. just let me know.

2032
01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:31.430
All right?

2033
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:33.313
- Okay. I will. trust me.

2034
01:45:34.211 --> 01:45:36.870
You've been a great help. man.
like I really appreciate you.

2035
01:45:36.870 --> 01:45:39.214
Thanks for everything.

2036
01:45:39.214 --> 01:45:40.673
- [Lucren] If you're sure
it's all I can do. brother.

2037
01:45:41.663 --> 01:45:42.496
See you soon.

2038
01:45:43.734 --> 01:45:46.401
(ominous music)

2039
01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:51.000
- Messiah. it's Sheldon.

2040
01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:52.816
Look. call me back as
soon as you get this.

2041
01:45:52.816 --> 01:45:53.649
It's about Lucren.

2042
01:45:53.649 --> 01:45:55.450
He's not who you thought he was.

2043
01:45:55.450 --> 01:45:57.670
Lucren. AKA the Blue Rose Assassin

2044
01:45:57.670 --> 01:45:59.777
is working with Cooper and Rugazzi.

2045
01:45:59.777 --> 01:46:02.010
Look. just call me back when you get this.

2046
01:46:02.010 --> 01:46:04.440
I'm headed down to the community center.

2047
01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:06.383
Messiah. watch your back.

2048
01:46:09.395 --> 01:46:12.062
(ominous music)

2049
01:46:22.917 --> 01:46:24.146
- [Eastside Doc] Hey Rugazzi.

2050
01:46:24.146 --> 01:46:25.270
(gunfire blasting)

2051
01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:26.446
(dramatic music)
(people yelling)

2052
01:46:26.446 --> 01:46:27.933
That's for Pretty Tony. mother fucker.

2053
01:46:27.933 --> 01:46:30.350
(jazz music)

2054
01:46:56.314 --> 01:46:59.080
(phone buzzing)

2055
01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:01.111
- Consider it a done deal. Council.

2056
01:47:01.111 --> 01:47:01.944
- Okay.

2057
01:47:10.005 --> 01:47:12.255
So did you find out the
whereabouts of Caira?

2058
01:47:13.907 --> 01:47:18.060
- Nah. I went to her apartment

2059
01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:20.260
and the landlord said
they haven't seen her.

2060
01:47:21.868 --> 01:47:24.323
I looked around and all I found was this.

2061
01:47:36.450 --> 01:47:37.370
So what's next?

2062
01:47:39.810 --> 01:47:40.643
- We wait.

2063
01:47:45.032 --> 01:47:46.782
- And when they come?

2064
01:47:50.536 --> 01:47:52.303
- We'll be waiting on them.

2065
01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:56.147
