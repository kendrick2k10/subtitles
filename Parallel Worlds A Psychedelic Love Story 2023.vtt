3
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.259
You're listening to KTPW.

4
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.109
That was "Jonestown" from Circus Patrol.

5
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.639
a band we haven't heard from

6
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.835
since the big crash and burn.

7
00:01:22.836 --> 00:01:25.771
Of course. fans have been
holding out for a reunion.

8
00:01:25.772 --> 00:01:29.009
but there's a better chance
of a snow day in hell

9
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.859
than those two ever sharing a stage again.

10
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.539
But as Lao Tzu said.

11
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.529
the candle that burns twice
as hot. burns twice as fast.

12
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.049
And damn they were hot.

13
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.479
All right. enough pining for the past.

14
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.199
Let's get back to another
rock block. right after this.

15
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.687
Playing only
the best music in the world.

16
00:01:49.688 --> 00:01:54.688
This is your number one radio station.

17
00:02:01.917 --> 00:02:02.969
This is Miles.

18
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.579
If you're not a robot. leave a message.

19
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.199
- Wake up. sleepy head.

20
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.120
It's your long lost producer. Jerry.

21
00:02:09.121 --> 00:02:11.309
Now. I don't know what dark cave

22
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.649
you've been hibernating in
for the past five years.

23
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.509
but if you think your pale flesh

24
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.089
could stand a bit of
sunlight. then listen up.

25
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.819
I just got a call from some mystery man

26
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.199
wants us to lay down some tracks

27
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.689
for a movie soundtrack in our old studio.

28
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.259
Some kind of cheesy romance
flick. but it's decent money.

29
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.399
And something tells me

30
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.110
that you could use a little
coin right about now.

31
00:02:32.111 --> 00:02:35.159
Yeah. yeah. I know.
soundtracks are for sellouts.

32
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.069
But before you get all
up on your high horse.

33
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.149
check this out.

34
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.424
If you do this and you do it good.

35
00:02:41.425 --> 00:02:44.219
there might be a solo
record deal in it for you.

36
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.899
This could be your way back. brother.

37
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.443
2:00 p.m. Don't be late.
Oh. and one more thing.

38
00:02:49.444 --> 00:02:52.619
He said he'd drop off some
instructions at your pad.

39
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.729
He said it's muy importante
that you follow them to a T.

40
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.576
See you soon. rock star.

41
00:03:43.025 --> 00:03:45.479
- Good day sunshine. mi amigos.

42
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.527
- Holy shit!

43
00:03:46.528 --> 00:03:47.361
Jerry.

44
00:03:47.362 --> 00:03:49.379
- Jerry! What's up man?

45
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.759
- Hey babies. Sorry I'm late.

46
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.099
I got deep into some
Barry White last night.

47
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.509
Totally out of body.

48
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.449
So you're probably all
wondering what's going on.

49
00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.709
- Well. yeah.

50
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.109
- Join the club. I don't
know much about it either.

51
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.899
Supposedly some other band
was on the gig. but they quit.

52
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.729
Walked out. never came back.

53
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:06.869
Can you believe that?

54
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.939
- Walked out? What happened. man?

55
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.639
- No idea. But here's where it gets weird.

56
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.780
Nobody's heard from them since.

57
00:04:13.781 --> 00:04:15.479
Vanished into thin air.

58
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.089
Anyway. this mystery man. whoever he is.

59
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.099
wants us to finish the thing.

60
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.213
No idea why. but screw it.
it's a paycheck. right?

61
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.249
- So. alright. let's.

62
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.359
Better
than the other way around.

63
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.559
- I guess we got some work to do.

64
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.393
Yeah.

65
00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:31.919
- Sorry. This morning's been
so crazy. I almost forgot.

66
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.480
Just a heads up. There's
gonna be one more joining us.

67
00:04:35.481 --> 00:04:36.330
- Who?

68
00:04:36.331 --> 00:04:37.480
- They didn't tell you?

69
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.933
Sorry. brother. They should have told you.

70
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.349
- Sweetie. Sweetie. No.
no. no. no. no. no. no.

71
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.350
You cannot have Cap'n Crunch for dinner.

72
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.839
Please eat whatever Lenora
makes for you. okay. honey?

73
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.643
All right. I miss you. I love you.

74
00:04:55.014 --> 00:04:57.659
Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.

75
00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:58.493
How are you?

76
00:04:58.494 --> 00:05:03.089
- I'm good. Oh my God.
it's so good to see you.

77
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.362
You look amazing.

78
00:05:04.363 --> 00:05:05.196
- Thank you.

79
00:05:05.197 --> 00:05:07.529
- Oh my God. Hi. how are you?

80
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:08.909
- I'm good. And you?

81
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:09.929
- I'm good. I'm good.

82
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.534
Crazy. My daughter's driving me nuts. Hi.

83
00:05:12.535 --> 00:05:13.368
- How you doing?

84
00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:16.701
- It's good to see you. What's up? What?

85
00:05:18.153 --> 00:05:21.253
Well shit. the fuck are you doing here?

86
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.087
- What am I doing here?

87
00:05:31.088 --> 00:05:33.203
What are you doing here?
Fucking slumming it?

88
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.009
- Jerry? Jerry?

89
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.989
There was no mention of him being here.

90
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.909
- Hey. I'm right here.

91
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.949
If you wanna say something.
say it to my face.

92
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.049
Oh. Unless. can you still not talk to me

93
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.450
without your lawyer present?

94
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.969
- Fuck this. I'm out.

95
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.649
Sorry. guys. Sorry. Jerry.

96
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:53.969
I'm not doing this. Goodbye.

97
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.079
- Yeah. walk away.

98
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.789
You got pretty good at that. didn't you?

99
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.219
- Listen up. lovebirds. Here's the news.

100
00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.569
We all signed a contract.

101
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.204
so unless we want the studio's lawyers

102
00:06:02.205 --> 00:06:04.679
taking a big old legal dump on our heads.

103
00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.789
nobody's going anywhere

104
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.059
until this soundtrack
is in the can. capish?

105
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.708
So let's just take three
deep ones. drop the egos.

106
00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:15.363
and we'll get this done in record time.

107
00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.029
Sound doable?

108
00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.113
- I'm good if she is.

109
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.406
- Fine. whatever. Let's
just get it over with.

110
00:06:43.287 --> 00:06:45.239
Are we ready to rock?

111
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.459
Sorry. I guess this
board's a little rusty.

112
00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.649
All right. I'm gonna give
you the high speed treatment

113
00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:50.789
so we can get rolling.

114
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.889
Okay. Struggling artist JB

115
00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:55.109
and his girlfriend Ella
meet five years ago.

116
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.639
JB is destined for greatness.

117
00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.169
Promises the girl the moon.

118
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.167
but flash forward and
things aren't so rosy.

119
00:07:00.168 --> 00:07:02.523
JB's big career never
gets out of first gear.

120
00:07:02.524 --> 00:07:04.319
Homegirl is ready to move on

121
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.149
if artist boy doesn't get a real job.

122
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:07.409
blah. blah. blah. blah.

123
00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:08.280
All right. All right.

124
00:07:08.281 --> 00:07:09.869
Here's where we come in.

125
00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.059
It's the morning of their
five year anniversary.

126
00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.159
JB wakes up hungover. as usual.

127
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.659
- Sounds familiar.

128
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.969
Pops into a liquor
store on his way to his studio

129
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.099
for a bottle of Pinot
for their special night.

130
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.659
Gets a case of sculptor's block.

131
00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.819
But wait. he gets a phone
call from his agent.

132
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.739
offering him a show in New York City.

133
00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.149
It's the big dilemma.

134
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.289
Does he stay in LA

135
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.869
or does he run off to chase
his dreams in the Big Apple?

136
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:31.703
- Very familiar.

137
00:07:31.704 --> 00:07:34.499
As expected. they
get into a huge argument.

138
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.419
JB walks the streets in a drunken stupor.

139
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.399
comes to his senses. races back to Ella.

140
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.159
and proposes to her on the rooftop.

141
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.749
Finir. the end. drinks
on me. Easy peasy. right?

142
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.717
Spirit in the sky. please

143
00:07:47.718 --> 00:07:50.253
get us through this session in one piece.

144
00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.673
Amen.

145
00:07:52.674 --> 00:07:56.160
And we are rolling in three. two. one.

146
00:08:20.299 --> 00:08:21.299
10 seconds.

147
00:09:32.847 --> 00:09:34.264
- Jerry. hold up.

148
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.049
Wasn't he supposed to
go into the liquor store

149
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:37.883
and get the wine?

150
00:09:37.884 --> 00:09:40.289
- Yeah. I'm not sure what's going on.

151
00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:41.969
We must have skipped over it somehow.

152
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:42.803
I'm sure it's fine.

153
00:09:42.804 --> 00:09:44.664
Let's just keep on trucking.

154
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.040
- The fuck was that?

155
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:51.809
- Maybe somebody's doing construction.

156
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.259
Can we just continue
please? Jerry. roll film.

157
00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.260
- Rolling.

158
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:53.309
You have two new messages.

159
00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:54.143
Hey. don't forget

160
00:11:54.143 --> 00:11:55.050
to follow up with Aaron Brothers.

161
00:11:55.051 --> 00:11:57.839
Tara went out of our way
to get you that interview.

162
00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.759
And don't forget the wine.

163
00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.069
Hey buddy. it's your agent.

164
00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:04.739
You need to get on the
plane to NYC immediately.

165
00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.701
I have a friend. he has a gallery

166
00:12:06.702 --> 00:12:09.569
and he just lost his artist.

167
00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:10.589
I don't know what happened.

168
00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:11.872
He broke his leg or his fingers.

169
00:12:11.873 --> 00:12:14.549
So listen. find a Red-Eye.

170
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:19.390
Get to NYC. This is your shot.
This is your show. Oh God.

171
00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.583
- This is it. This is it.

172
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.829
We're talking New York City. baby.

173
00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:42.599
This is the big time.

174
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.723
This is what we've been
waiting for. for five years.

175
00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:50.023
- I'm assuming they didn't
pay for your plane ticket.

176
00:12:50.024 --> 00:12:51.424
That's not the point.

177
00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:53.410
Right.

178
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.459
- Just once. Is it too
much to ask just once

179
00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.649
to have just ounce of faith?

180
00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:02.013
- An ounce? You're joking. right?

181
00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.659
- I thought. I thought we
were gonna go the distance.

182
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.249
You said. I'm ready to go the distance.

183
00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:10.079
I'll go the distance with
you. That's what you said.

184
00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.733
- Please. Not that again.

185
00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.729
I've gone the distance five years.

186
00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:15.563
That was our deal.

187
00:13:15.564 --> 00:13:16.679
And then we were gonna get married

188
00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.089
and we were gonna have kids.

189
00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:19.469
I have dreams too. you know?

190
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.359
- If I get a dead end job now

191
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.569
everything I've done my
entire life is nothing.

192
00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:26.009
Might as well have just been a dream.

193
00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:30.479
- Honey. there's nothing
wrong with dreaming.

194
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.569
but at some point we've
gotta face reality.

195
00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:35.669
- All right. what reality is that?

196
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.353
- Not everybody strikes gold.

197
00:13:40.532 --> 00:13:44.909
- That. that's good. Mm-hmm. That is rich.

198
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:49.647
This is coming from. "I just
wanna be happy and be a mommy."

199
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:09.149
- We allow leading man come to his senses.

200
00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:10.529
race back to the love of his life.

201
00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:15.089
and propose to her against
the smog-laced L.A. sunset.

202
00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:18.659
Stay tuned. And we're onto "Scavenger."

203
00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:22.844
On my mark. Three. two. hit me.

204
00:14:30.379 --> 00:14:31.619
- You just gonna sit there?

205
00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.370
- Let me know if you need anything.

206
00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:36.583
- Okay.

207
00:15:59.799 --> 00:16:01.556
Hi.

208
00:16:01.557 --> 00:16:03.689
- Are you. are you really recording?

209
00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:04.845
Yes.

210
00:16:04.846 --> 00:16:06.026
Okay. What's this about?

211
00:16:06.027 --> 00:16:08.477
Where do you see
yourself in five years?

212
00:16:10.699 --> 00:16:12.764
It's about to get real here.

213
00:16:12.765 --> 00:16:13.598
- Five years?

214
00:16:13.599 --> 00:16:15.265
Five years.

215
00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.819
- Five years. Being successful.

216
00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:21.899
Being. being a highly
paid. in-demand artist.

217
00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.547
Mm-hmm. That
seems simple enough. yeah?

218
00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:26.973
- It seems simple.

219
00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:33.052
- But no. no. I mean. I'm
embracing the challenge.

220
00:16:33.053 --> 00:16:35.906
And I'm gonna. I'm
gonna enjoy the journey.

221
00:16:35.907 --> 00:16:37.039
Yeah.

222
00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.306
- Okay. Barbara Walters.

223
00:16:38.307 --> 00:16:39.316
What? No.

224
00:16:39.317 --> 00:16:41.231
- You. yeah. you step into the spotlight.

225
00:16:41.232 --> 00:16:42.232
- Okay.

226
00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.279
- Where do you see yourself in five years?

227
00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:55.280
- In five years. okay. In
five years I see myself

228
00:16:55.740 --> 00:17:00.740
happy. and I see myself
being a devoted wife.

229
00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:07.030
and a good mother. and
telling people I love them

230
00:17:11.301 --> 00:17:16.289
before it's too late. and
watching American Idol religiously

231
00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:17.290
and eating popcorn.

232
00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:20.906
Butter and salt?

233
00:17:20.907 --> 00:17:23.573
- And cayenne. A lot of cayenne.

234
00:17:24.602 --> 00:17:26.734
That's it. you had me at Idol.

235
00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:28.409
- Wait. what just happened?

236
00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:30.119
Why is he in a taxi?

237
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.799
- The bigger question is

238
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.249
why does he have a plane
ticket to New York in his hand?

239
00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:36.689
- Well. the plot thickens.

240
00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:38.489
- All right. what the fuck is going on?

241
00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:41.369
- Greener pastures. baby. Can't blame him.

242
00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:43.199
- Jerry. did you skip
over anything earlier?

243
00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.299
- Negative. Scrubbed straight through.

244
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:46.529
I don't remember any of this.

245
00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.559
- Me either. Could. could
the file be corrupted?

246
00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:50.789
- That's a possibility.

247
00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:52.889
- All right. well. can you
do me a favor and forward it?

248
00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:54.269
There's. this is a chick flick.

249
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:56.170
There's no way that it ends like this.

250
00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.069
What the fuck is this?

251
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:18.449
Jerry. can you forward it to the end?

252
00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.489
- Sorry. Charlie. I can't.

253
00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:21.809
- What do you mean you can't?

254
00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:23.099
- I mean. the movie won't forward.

255
00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.020
Something must be wrong
with the hard drive.

256
00:20:25.021 --> 00:20:26.729
- Unfuckingbelievable.

257
00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:29.759
Jesus. what kind of ending is this?

258
00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.069
- Calm down.

259
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:35.459
- Don't tell me to calm
down. This is bullshit.

260
00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:37.349
- So the endings different? So what?

261
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:38.350
What do you care?

262
00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:40.253
Oh. wait a minute.

263
00:20:40.253 --> 00:20:41.086
You actually want this guy

264
00:20:41.087 --> 00:20:43.049
to go back to his girlfriend. don't you?

265
00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:45.749
- It wasn't supposed to
end this way. That's all.

266
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:47.399
- Maybe the schmaltzy
ending didn't test well.

267
00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.309
Maybe they didn't like the
girlfriend's downer attitude.

268
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:51.240
You know. maybe she's been trying

269
00:20:51.241 --> 00:20:53.068
to sabotage his success all along.

270
00:20:53.069 --> 00:20:55.019
Oh. wait a minute. That's right.

271
00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:58.409
Nobody could possibly be
that selfish. could they?

272
00:20:58.410 --> 00:20:59.939
- Jerry. can you just try again?

273
00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.983
- Sorry. senor. It ain't budging.

274
00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.613
- You guys remember that
episode of The Twilight?

275
00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.989
- Houston. we have a problem.

276
00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:20.129
That was the studio.

277
00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:22.773
It appears that everything's gone offline.

278
00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:24.780
- What do you mean offline?

279
00:21:24.781 --> 00:21:28.169
- All the media for the movie
is gone. vanished. poof.

280
00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:29.879
Like it never existed.

281
00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.183
I don't know what this is.
but it isn't the movie.

282
00:21:35.454 --> 00:21:37.653
- I can't. I'm not. I'm
not doing this anymore.

283
00:21:37.654 --> 00:21:38.487
Fucking shit.

284
00:21:38.487 --> 00:21:39.320
- What are you doing?

285
00:21:39.321 --> 00:21:42.753
- Is there anything you touch
that doesn't turn to shit?

286
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:44.849
- So you're just gonna leave?

287
00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:46.799
- I got better things to do with my time.

288
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:47.800
Bid you adieu.

289
00:21:50.254 --> 00:21:54.119
Why is this door locked?
Who locked the door?

290
00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.949
- I think you just gotta kick it.

291
00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:57.479
- Maybe it's locked from the other side.

292
00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:58.890
- Who would do that?

293
00:22:01.589 --> 00:22:03.389
- All right. this is
starting to freak me out.

294
00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:04.829
I'm gonna call my agent.

295
00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:07.259
- Your agent? How about
a fucking locksmith?

296
00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:08.220
- I'm not getting any recep-

297
00:22:08.221 --> 00:22:09.239
Do you guys have any bars?

298
00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.379
- I got nothing.

299
00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:11.213
- Me neither.

300
00:22:11.214 --> 00:22:12.299
- This is bullshit.

301
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.789
- Oh. I'm so sorry you can't
just slither away from this.

302
00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:15.790
- Fuck you.

303
00:22:17.517 --> 00:22:18.517
Shit.

304
00:22:21.642 --> 00:22:22.642
Ridiculous.

305
00:23:11.677 --> 00:23:12.677
- Holy shit.

306
00:23:13.766 --> 00:23:16.516
That's not weird.

307
00:23:33.093 --> 00:23:36.361
- I would like you to meet one
of my most handsome artists.

308
00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.144
- It's nothing personal.

309
00:23:48.145 --> 00:23:50.697
- Everything in this business
is personal. you idiot.

310
00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:53.993
- It's showtime.

311
00:25:20.315 --> 00:25:23.265
- Hang on a second. I mean. I
just wanna get this straight.

312
00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:27.843
You think our music changed
the ending of the movie?

313
00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:31.079
God. you are crazier than I thought.

314
00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.089
- You think that's crazy?

315
00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:34.593
I think we can change it back.

316
00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:36.839
- Change it back to what?

317
00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.090
- To the original ending.

318
00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:40.533
- Did you just get stoned?

319
00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.020
How the hell we gonna do that?

320
00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:45.030
- We gotta play that.

321
00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:50.783
- Uh-uh.

322
00:25:50.784 --> 00:25:54.507
- Side one. Track one. a little
song called "Snapdragons."

323
00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:56.363
- What was I thinking?

324
00:25:56.364 --> 00:25:59.159
What was I thinking agreeing to this gig?

325
00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:02.433
- Let's play it. just
once for old times sake.

326
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:08.009
I dare you.

327
00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:10.949
- A little nostalgic blast from the past.

328
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:12.599
I can dig it.

329
00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.221
Buckle up. pop star.

330
00:26:14.222 --> 00:26:15.622
It's time to get real again.

331
00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.710
- Anyway. so he says. I don't
even know. I didn't touch it.

332
00:26:38.711 --> 00:26:40.415
I don't even know where Liberia is.

333
00:26:40.416 --> 00:26:43.199
Oh. here he is.

334
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.179
Georgia Klein. I would like you to meet

335
00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:49.930
one of my most handsome artists.
Jonathan Christian Beck.

336
00:26:49.931 --> 00:26:52.709
- It's Johnny. But you can call me JB.

337
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:54.870
It's a pleasure to meet you.

338
00:26:54.871 --> 00:26:56.202
- 10 Seconds.

339
00:26:56.203 --> 00:26:58.709
- Delighted. So glad you could make it.

340
00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:00.678
Klaus tells me that
you had some good press

341
00:27:00.679 --> 00:27:01.953
on your last show.

342
00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:08.421
Oh. modesty. What a lovely
surprise you brought me. Klaus.

343
00:27:08.422 --> 00:27:10.843
- Oh. isn't he adorable?

344
00:27:15.567 --> 00:27:16.400
- Oh. that's tonight?

345
00:27:16.401 --> 00:27:18.417
Fabulous.

346
00:27:18.418 --> 00:27:19.913
JB?

347
00:27:19.914 --> 00:27:20.914
JB?

348
00:27:23.677 --> 00:27:24.677
JB?

349
00:27:26.637 --> 00:27:27.933
- Could you excuse me?

350
00:27:34.542 --> 00:27:38.733
Okay. This is not happening. this is not.

351
00:27:38.734 --> 00:27:40.567
Come on. you got this.

352
00:29:58.060 --> 00:29:58.893
- Let me help you with that.

353
00:29:58.894 --> 00:30:01.226
- Oh. no. you don't have to.

354
00:30:03.983 --> 00:30:05.433
Did you get a flat?

355
00:30:06.836 --> 00:30:09.910
- Huh? What? Oh. no. no.

356
00:30:11.661 --> 00:30:16.661
I collect junk and gather it to. to.

357
00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:22.032
to make profound pieces of beauty.

358
00:30:22.033 --> 00:30:24.905
- Oh. so you're an artist.

359
00:30:24.906 --> 00:30:25.906
- Yeah.

360
00:30:26.831 --> 00:30:30.276
- I don't. I don't think I've
ever actually met an artist.

361
00:30:30.277 --> 00:30:32.369
- Well. now I'm at your service.

362
00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:34.293
So how about I fix this?

363
00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.780
- This? You're gonna fix this?

364
00:30:38.351 --> 00:30:40.646
- Okay. I guarantee you
it won't look the same.

365
00:30:40.647 --> 00:30:43.923
but I promise you it will
be something interesting.

366
00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:50.166
If you don't like it. we'll
drop it off a rooftop.

367
00:30:50.167 --> 00:30:51.989
- You have access to a rooftop?

368
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:53.013
- Yeah. Several.

369
00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:03.273
- Deal. Sure. Why not?

370
00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:05.110
- Deal. Okay.

371
00:31:25.829 --> 00:31:27.202
What the fuck?

372
00:31:27.203 --> 00:31:32.203
- JB. JB. stop. Stop. Listen. stop.

373
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.189
Now. I know this is all a bit new to you

374
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:36.959
and it may feel a bit strange.

375
00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:38.189
but I need you to listen closely

376
00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:40.889
because I'm only going
to say this once. okay?

377
00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:44.249
Now. when Georgia Klein
invites you to a party

378
00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:46.979
or to a brunch or to her
grandmother's funeral.

379
00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:49.349
I want you to say yes. Okay?

380
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:53.103
Stay it with me. Yes. Say it.

381
00:31:54.363 --> 00:31:55.218
- Yes.
- Yes.

382
00:31:55.219 --> 00:31:59.429
Good. Now you go get some sleep

383
00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:01.193
and I will see you bright and early.

384
00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.019
- Beautiful take. kids.

385
00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:06.336
Good to hear that song
after all these years.

386
00:32:06.337 --> 00:32:08.916
All right. moving on to track two.

387
00:32:08.917 --> 00:32:10.702
"Beautiful Junk."

388
00:32:24.611 --> 00:32:25.611
- Hi.

389
00:32:27.173 --> 00:32:28.173
- Hi.

390
00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:33.723
You really didn't have to do this.

391
00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.439
- Well. let's save the gratitude
until you actually see it.

392
00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.990
- Uh-oh. Is it bad?

393
00:32:42.159 --> 00:32:44.045
It's subjective.

394
00:32:45.582 --> 00:32:46.832
Come in.

395
00:32:48.379 --> 00:32:49.379
- Okay.

396
00:32:56.515 --> 00:32:58.380
- Okay. Close your eyes.

397
00:33:00.339 --> 00:33:02.672
Okay. this way. And wallah.

398
00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:13.076
Should we head the rooftop?

399
00:33:13.077 --> 00:33:17.999
- Oh. I think it's awesome.

400
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.070
A bit disturbing. but awesome.

401
00:33:22.363 --> 00:33:24.446
- Great. That'll be $500.

402
00:33:25.393 --> 00:33:26.726
- Oh yeah. Yeah.

403
00:33:28.787 --> 00:33:31.462
Wow.

404
00:33:31.463 --> 00:33:32.796
This is amazing.

405
00:33:37.145 --> 00:33:38.728
That's really cool.

406
00:33:41.995 --> 00:33:44.214
Whoa. what is this?

407
00:33:44.215 --> 00:33:47.098
- Oh. this is optical art.

408
00:33:47.099 --> 00:33:49.409
It's perspectable anamorphosis.

409
00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:50.410
- English. please.

410
00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:54.119
- It means you can only
see what the image is when

411
00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.833
okay. follow me one more time.

412
00:33:55.834 --> 00:33:57.389
Okay.

413
00:33:57.390 --> 00:34:01.153
When you see it
from the right perspective.

414
00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:05.219
- Oh my gosh. It's a whale.

415
00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:08.309
- What? It's supposed to be a dolphin.

416
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:09.749
I'll settle for whale.

417
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:10.750
- Okay.

418
00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:16.469
You are really talented. Seriously.

419
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:19.950
Not everybody just has a
gift like this. I mean. what

420
00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:24.269
what are you gonna do with all of this?

421
00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:25.559
- I wanna give people the opportunity

422
00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.749
to see things differently.

423
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:30.389
What most people consider
junk and just throw it away

424
00:34:30.390 --> 00:34:35.339
that from the right
perspective. it can be.

425
00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:36.917
it can be beautiful.

426
00:34:52.923 --> 00:34:55.143
- God. I forgot how
beautiful this song is.

427
00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:58.563
- Hang on. Was that a smile?

428
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:04.709
- Maybe. a little one.
Don't get used to it.

429
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:07.199
- Real nice. Real nice.

430
00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.999
I think Tinseltown refers to that

431
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.279
as a classic Hollywood flashback.

432
00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:12.629
A few more jokes like that.

433
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:16.199
And movie hero will be back in
his lover's arms in no time.

434
00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.156
This might be easier than we thought.

435
00:35:18.157 --> 00:35:20.369
"Let Your Hair Down" is next.

436
00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:21.940
Yabba Dabba Doo.

437
00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:31.763
- Hello?

438
00:35:31.764 --> 00:35:32.925
Oh my God.

439
00:35:32.926 --> 00:35:35.436
Did you hear what I just said?

440
00:35:35.437 --> 00:35:37.499
- Sorry. Sorry. what?

441
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.909
Wake up. Johnny.

442
00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:40.409
Georgia wants to see you tonight.

443
00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:43.439
So take a bath. have a Xanax.
whatever you need to do.

444
00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:47.129
Annex Gallery. 10:00.
Okay? Can you make that?

445
00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:47.963
- Yeah. Yeah. I got it.

446
00:35:47.964 --> 00:35:49.698
Good. Okay.

447
00:35:49.699 --> 00:35:51.269
Did you. did you. did
you get her those photos?

448
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:52.103
- Yes.

449
00:35:52.104 --> 00:35:53.729
Okay. good. I
I. I'll see you tonight.

450
00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:54.933
Wear something nice.

451
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:07.563
- It can get overwhelming. can't it?

452
00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:11.463
- Oh no. I'm. I'm cool.

453
00:36:12.519 --> 00:36:14.613
I'm just a bit distracted. so.

454
00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.023
Does this
distraction have a name?

455
00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.893
- Wow. you are good.

456
00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:28.940
Yeah. it does. but I really
don't want to get into it.

457
00:36:29.063 --> 00:36:30.213
I've moved on.

458
00:36:31.975 --> 00:36:33.639
Good for you.

459
00:36:34.472 --> 00:36:35.613
To the City of Dreams.

460
00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:37.780
- City of Dreams.

461
00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:43.210
- This is me.

462
00:36:46.579 --> 00:36:49.289
Thanks for the noodles.

463
00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:50.999
- Thank you for the ice cream.

464
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.950
The orange sherbet and chocolate. was a

465
00:36:53.917 --> 00:36:56.309
it was a very interesting combination.

466
00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:57.869
- It was very brave of you to try it

467
00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:59.729
without asking for a sample.

468
00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:02.943
Yeah. well that's
what do. I live on the edge.

469
00:37:04.699 --> 00:37:07.382
- I had a really nice time.

470
00:37:07.383 --> 00:37:09.049
- Yeah. me too.

471
00:39:24.648 --> 00:39:28.724
- Do you know we've been
together for 30 days now?

472
00:39:28.725 --> 00:39:31.399
Do you know what that means?

473
00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:33.648
- No refunds. no exchanges.

474
00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:38.980
- Here's to our future.

475
00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:44.013
- No matter how grand or unimpressive.

476
00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:02.710
- What if he doesn't go back?

477
00:40:04.008 --> 00:40:05.206
He will.

478
00:40:05.207 --> 00:40:07.439
And if he doesn't?

479
00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:08.933
Then we keep playing.

480
00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:11.639
All of it?

481
00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:12.843
- As much as it takes.

482
00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:20.069
- What happened?

483
00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:22.739
- What is it? Is it junk? Is it pills?

484
00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:26.103
Just. just tell me. Just let me help you.

485
00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:31.300
- She wanted to be a ballet dancer.

486
00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:34.443
- What are you talking about?

487
00:40:36.648 --> 00:40:39.003
- But not everybody strikes gold.

488
00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:41.899
- God. how did I not see this coming?

489
00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:45.569
Look at me. Johnny.
listen. Listen to me. Okay?

490
00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:48.989
Just look around you. look where you are.

491
00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:50.849
You miss Ella? Let me tell you something

492
00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:53.189
she made her choice and so did you.

493
00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:56.256
And if she loved you. she would be here.

494
00:41:10.508 --> 00:41:12.508
You have 48 hours. Okay?

495
00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:15.443
Let me assure you.

496
00:41:15.444 --> 00:41:16.320
There are 50 other artists

497
00:41:16.321 --> 00:41:18.370
that could take your place in an instant.

498
00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:21.370
You're not special.

499
00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:24.023
But she picked you. Okay?

500
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000
So buck up.

501
00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:40.307
Now I'm going back in
to clean up your mess.

502
00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:18.203
- Yeah?

503
00:42:18.204 --> 00:42:19.310
How we looking?

504
00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.919
- We're looking good. Back on track.

505
00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:23.753
Wonderful.

506
00:42:23.754 --> 00:42:25.949
- Yeah. Look. hey. I wanna
apologize about last night.

507
00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:28.799
I let her back into my head.
But look. everything's good.

508
00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:32.459
Ah. see. that
is the Johnny boy I know.

509
00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:34.583
I've got to run. I will see in a few.

510
00:42:34.584 --> 00:42:37.319
- This is gonna take all night.

511
00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:38.999
Well. rock stars.

512
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.523
It appears we better put
on a strong pot of joe.

513
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:47.009
- I got bars.

514
00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:48.010
- Yeah. me too.

515
00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:50.740
- I gotta take this.

516
00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:54.490
Yeah. No.

517
00:42:57.608 --> 00:42:58.600
No. he doesn't know.

518
00:42:58.600 --> 00:42:59.600
Okay. bye.

519
00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:03.569
Who was that?

520
00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:04.570
- No one.

521
00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:08.340
- Can I talk to you for a second?

522
00:43:10.416 --> 00:43:11.819
- What?

523
00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:14.159
- There's something
going on with this movie.

524
00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.509
- You're just figuring that out?

525
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:17.489
- I mean. I keep getting
this weird feeling

526
00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:18.590
while I'm watching it.

527
00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:20.543
- Like what?

528
00:43:20.544 --> 00:43:22.439
It's like deja vu or something.

529
00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:23.579
- Well. obviously. Miles.

530
00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:25.409
we haven't played these songs in years.

531
00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:28.529
- No. it's these flashbacks
that JB's having.

532
00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:30.959
They're like scenes from our past.

533
00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:33.089
All right. it's a
little bit of a coincidence.

534
00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:34.564
- It's not a coincidence.

535
00:43:34.565 --> 00:43:36.059
- Okay.

536
00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:37.949
- Don't you think it's a bit weird

537
00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:40.169
that Ella had braids in her hair?

538
00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:41.100
- Why is that weird?

539
00:43:41.101 --> 00:43:42.809
How? Seriously?

540
00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:45.419
Our songs are somehow
creating these memories.

541
00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:48.659
But like as some kind
of trippy dream version.

542
00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:50.399
- Trippy dream version?

543
00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:53.300
- Come on. don't tell me that
you didn't feel any of this.

544
00:43:54.144 --> 00:43:56.227
- I don't know what you want me to say.

545
00:43:56.228 --> 00:43:57.787
You can't admit it.

546
00:43:57.788 --> 00:43:58.710
- Admit what?

547
00:43:58.711 --> 00:44:00.963
- That these songs mean something to you.

548
00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:03.430
- Really?

549
00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:07.649
If you don't mind. I'd
like to get back to work.

550
00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:08.700
We're under contract.

551
00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:12.040
- Whatever you say.

552
00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:20.939
- Hey Jerry. where is everyone?

553
00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:22.143
- Taking a smoke break.

554
00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:25.300
- Perfect.

555
00:44:56.140 --> 00:45:01.140
- What the fuck is this?

556
00:45:21.614 --> 00:45:23.710
What the fuck are you doing?

557
00:45:23.711 --> 00:45:25.079
- Oh shit.

558
00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:26.040
- What are you doing?

559
00:45:26.041 --> 00:45:27.990
- Same thing you're doing. that's what.

560
00:45:30.286 --> 00:45:31.950
- It was you all along. Why?

561
00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:35.489
- Boy. that's my Miles. huh?

562
00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:38.343
So self-absorbed. He only
sees what he wants to see.

563
00:45:39.417 --> 00:45:41.967
You think you're the only
one who got one of these?

564
00:45:49.647 --> 00:45:51.153
- Unbelievable.

565
00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:55.229
What could that guy have
possibly offered you

566
00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:56.866
that you don't already have?

567
00:45:56.867 --> 00:45:59.699
- I have my reasons. okay? Same as you.

568
00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:01.199
- They must be pretty damn good reasons

569
00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.450
for you to fucking cheat.

570
00:46:04.050 --> 00:46:07.139
- Please don't pull this Mr.
Integrity bullshit right now.

571
00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:08.140
- Whatever.

572
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:14.420
- Well. where do we go from here?

573
00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:18.749
There's only one way I see.

574
00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:20.129
What's that?

575
00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:22.649
We let our movie hero decide.

576
00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:25.589
but we stick to the album
this time. all right?

577
00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:26.999
- Fine.

578
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.413
- Whatever happens. happens.

579
00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:32.037
- Whatever happens. happens.

580
00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:38.639
- I mean. JB. people work.

581
00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:41.999
People go out and get
jobs. It's not unusual.

582
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.249
I mean. they don't hang
onto some ridiculous fantasy

583
00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:47.369
that a windfall of cash is
gonna fall out of the sky.

584
00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:50.579
- A ridiculous fantasy?
That's what this is now?

585
00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:51.570
A ridiculous fantasy?

586
00:46:51.571 --> 00:46:53.309
- You know what I mean.

587
00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:55.169
- No. I don't know what you mean.

588
00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:57.641
So why do you enlighten me. Nietzsche?

589
00:46:57.642 --> 00:46:59.159
- I mean that maybe you need

590
00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:00.719
to face the very real possibility

591
00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:02.849
that you're never gonna
have a flat in Soho

592
00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:04.589
or Paris or wear turtlenecks

593
00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:06.779
or have a fucking entourage
that follows you around.

594
00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:07.646
That's what I mean.

595
00:47:07.647 --> 00:47:09.297
I mean that maybe you need
to think about the fact

596
00:47:09.298 --> 00:47:11.669
that you might be a
regular person just like me

597
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:12.899
and everybody else around you.

598
00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:14.699
And you might have to get a regular job.

599
00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:15.570
That's what I mean.

600
00:47:15.571 --> 00:47:16.679
And I also mean that maybe

601
00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:18.089
you should have taken
some of those commissions

602
00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:21.149
that were offered to you that
for some godforsaken reason

603
00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:23.279
you thought were way too below you.

604
00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:24.684
- I didn't take those commissions

605
00:47:24.685 --> 00:47:29.233
because the shit they wanted
wasn't what I wanted to do.

606
00:47:30.267 --> 00:47:32.399
And I'm not gonna spend
my life doing shit I hate.

607
00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:33.603
I'd rather starve.

608
00:47:34.974 --> 00:47:36.124
- Do you hear yourself?

609
00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:38.519
There's things that I want.

610
00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:40.170
Have you ever thought about that?

611
00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.040
- You're free.

612
00:47:44.514 --> 00:47:46.764
You're not chained down.
You're not my slave.

613
00:47:48.810 --> 00:47:51.376
If you want something. you go get it.

614
00:47:51.377 --> 00:47:53.227
- You're never gonna change. are you?

615
00:47:54.067 --> 00:47:55.913
- Not into whatever it is you want me to.

616
00:51:01.167 --> 00:51:02.759
- All right kiddos.

617
00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:05.283
We've arrived at the
last song on side one.

618
00:51:06.397 --> 00:51:11.397
"I Had a Dream" in three. two. one.

619
00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:16.021
I talked to Ken

620
00:51:16.022 --> 00:51:17.759
about picking up some weekend shifts.

621
00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:19.521
Just a few extra hours.

622
00:51:19.522 --> 00:51:21.037
- You don't have to.

623
00:51:21.038 --> 00:51:22.373
- I want to.

624
00:51:22.374 --> 00:51:24.707
I want. I want this to work.

625
00:51:26.970 --> 00:51:27.970
I believe in you.

626
00:51:31.278 --> 00:51:32.278
In us.

627
00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:39.133
- I promise you. it will
all be worth it one day.

628
00:53:31.123 --> 00:53:32.123
- Hey.

629
00:53:34.244 --> 00:53:37.653
Klaus called. I didn't get the show.

630
00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:43.093
Too many artists or not enough galleries.

631
00:53:44.063 --> 00:53:45.782
I don't know.

632
00:53:45.783 --> 00:53:46.953
It's so pathetic.

633
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:51.370
- Maybe there's a reason that

634
00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:54.963
you're not some big success story yet.

635
00:53:56.550 --> 00:53:58.679
- If the Big Man wanted
me to work at Chevron.

636
00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:00.416
He wouldn't have given me this talent.

637
00:54:00.417 --> 00:54:03.599
- I'm not saying give
up. I'm just saying that

638
00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:05.129
maybe you could start looking at it

639
00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:07.898
from a little bit of a
different perspective.

640
00:54:07.899 --> 00:54:08.939
- Like what?

641
00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:12.543
- Maybe a way to use your
gift for a real purpose.

642
00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:16.983
You're chasing the elusive
carrot. sweetheart.

643
00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:20.773
If or when you catch it.

644
00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:25.400
you might realize it
was never worth chasing.

645
00:56:01.454 --> 00:56:02.537
- Fuck! Fuck!

646
00:56:15.042 --> 00:56:16.042
Hello?

647
00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:22.443
Is there somebody here?

648
00:56:25.530 --> 00:56:29.553
Look. who are you? What
do you want from me?

649
00:56:31.089 --> 00:56:32.313
Why are you doing this?

650
00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:36.683
Just leave me the fuck alone.

651
00:56:54.004 --> 00:56:55.921
Oh. Hello. How are you?

652
00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:02.523
I know who you are.

653
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:05.470
That's right.

654
00:57:06.570 --> 00:57:07.570
And you know what?

655
00:57:09.210 --> 00:57:10.210
Fuck you.

656
00:57:11.490 --> 00:57:12.543
You're not real.

657
00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:14.883
None of you are real.

658
00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:22.580
Every single one of you are
figments of my imagination.

659
00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:24.813
This is all just a bad dream.

660
00:57:25.860 --> 00:57:30.860
Okay. be cool. Be cool.
JB. Everything is cool.

661
00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:35.170
It's just your good stress talking. okay?

662
00:57:38.850 --> 00:57:39.869
Jerry?

663
00:57:39.870 --> 00:57:42.567
They told me this might happen.

664
00:57:42.568 --> 00:57:44.429
What might happen?

665
00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:46.469
- That you'd figure it out.

666
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:47.770
Figure what out?

667
00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:50.733
- That. that this isn't a movie.

668
00:57:52.170 --> 00:57:53.170
- What is it then?

669
00:57:55.856 --> 00:57:56.856
- It's reality.

670
00:57:59.940 --> 00:58:02.883
- If that's reality.
where the fuck are we?

671
00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:06.577
Welcome to the
machine. Lizard King.

672
00:58:49.530 --> 00:58:50.849
- What's going on?

673
00:58:50.850 --> 00:58:52.439
- You might wanna sit down.

674
00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:53.549
- Just say it.

675
00:58:53.550 --> 00:58:54.959
- It's better if you sit down.

676
00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:57.269
- God damnit Jerry. just
tell us where we are.

677
00:58:57.270 --> 00:59:01.443
- Short answer. We're
inside that guy's head.

678
00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:17.685
- Is there somebody here?

679
00:59:17.686 --> 00:59:19.007
- It's like deja vu or something.

680
00:59:19.008 --> 00:59:20.299
- You think you're the only
one who got one of these?

681
00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:22.372
- I just got a call from some mystery man.

682
00:59:39.570 --> 00:59:41.220
- Come on. this is a joke. right?

683
00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:43.260
- You seem disappointed.

684
00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:46.619
Oh. come on now.

685
00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:49.469
Don't tell me you haven't
suspected this all along.

686
00:59:49.470 --> 00:59:53.099
In fact. you've known it
ever since you can remember.

687
00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:55.409
Something was always a little off.

688
00:59:55.410 --> 00:59:57.869
A memory here. a dream there.

689
00:59:57.870 --> 01:00:00.179
The voices inside your head.

690
01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:01.859
There's only one answer.

691
01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:03.813
We're all a part of him.

692
01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:08.069
The way I see it. you can kick and scream

693
01:00:08.070 --> 01:00:10.319
or you can accept the situation

694
01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:12.089
and find some meaning in it.

695
01:00:12.090 --> 01:00:14.571
You always said you wanted
your music to matter.

696
01:00:14.572 --> 01:00:16.671
to change people's lives.

697
01:00:16.672 --> 01:00:20.123
Well. here's your chance.

698
01:00:20.124 --> 01:00:23.183
There. it's out there.
Cards are on the table.

699
01:00:23.184 --> 01:00:25.229
Now can we get back to recording?

700
01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:26.609
We're running out of time.

701
01:00:26.610 --> 01:00:28.019
- What happened to the other band?

702
01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:31.010
- They couldn't hack it.
Couldn't get it done.

703
01:00:31.011 --> 01:00:35.309
So poof. they disappeared.
That's how it works.

704
01:00:35.310 --> 01:00:37.559
Couldn't get what done?

705
01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:39.179
- We're deciding his future.

706
01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:44.180
- One of you is. and the other
is going bye-bye permanently.

707
01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:47.009
Now you know the stakes.

708
01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:49.979
So without further ado.
we better step on it.

709
01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:51.330
We only have until morning.

710
01:00:58.320 --> 01:00:59.320
- Fuck it.

711
01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:02.639
What are you doing?

712
01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:05.483
- What does it look like I'm
doing? It's time for side two.

713
01:01:06.570 --> 01:01:10.003
- Seriously. you found out
our entire existence is a sham

714
01:01:10.004 --> 01:01:13.015
and you're interested
in winning the contest?

715
01:01:13.016 --> 01:01:14.474
Amazing.

716
01:01:14.475 --> 01:01:18.854
- Okay. First off. have you
seen my entire existence?

717
01:01:18.855 --> 01:01:22.109
Finding out that I live
inside some sculptor's head

718
01:01:22.110 --> 01:01:26.129
is a breath of fucking
fresh air. Believe me.

719
01:01:26.130 --> 01:01:30.453
And second. oh yeah. I'm
gonna win this contest.

720
01:01:31.290 --> 01:01:35.369
So strap on. pop star. and let's
do what we came here to do.

721
01:01:35.370 --> 01:01:38.819
I mean. unless you wanna back out now.

722
01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:40.220
- Not a chance. Sling Blade.

723
01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:44.189
You're on. Jerry. that thing on?

724
01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:45.899
- Locked and loaded. babe.

725
01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:46.900
Let's do this.

726
01:01:47.730 --> 01:01:50.493
- Buckle up. kid. You're
in for a wild night.

727
01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:18.873
- The pipe under the kitchen
sink is leaking again.

728
01:04:20.578 --> 01:04:25.578
- Yeah? Why don't you call a plumber?

729
01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:28.049
- We can't afford a fricking plumber.

730
01:04:28.050 --> 01:04:29.669
Why don't you just get off your lazy ass

731
01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:31.679
and do something about it?

732
01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:34.409
- You're here all day. Why
don't you read a fucking manual?

733
01:04:34.410 --> 01:04:35.969
Figure it out yourself. I'm not moving.

734
01:04:35.970 --> 01:04:39.119
- Because I do enough
around this stupid house.

735
01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:39.953
I mean. what do you think I'm doing?

736
01:04:39.954 --> 01:04:41.519
I'm not just like
sitting down watching TV.

737
01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:42.529
I don't remember the last time I did that.

738
01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:44.609
- Oh my God. Oh my God. Your voice.

739
01:04:44.610 --> 01:04:46.979
- You're such a child. I can't.

740
01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:48.471
- I think it's. I think
it's quite possibly

741
01:04:48.472 --> 01:04:50.632
the worst sound in the entire world.

742
01:04:50.633 --> 01:04:52.347
Shut up.

743
01:04:52.348 --> 01:04:54.847
- That's what I'm trying
to get you to do. Shut up.

744
01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.120
Fuck that song.

745
01:08:09.121 --> 01:08:10.799
- Why? Because it's true?

746
01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:12.629
- Oh. if getting knocked
up by some asshole

747
01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:14.219
so you can get a recording contract

748
01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:17.459
is your version of the truth.
then you are welcome to it.

749
01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:19.838
- You wouldn't have the first fucking idea

750
01:08:19.839 --> 01:08:22.286
what it is to be a
responsible parent. Miles.

751
01:08:22.287 --> 01:08:25.469
I can't imagine what a train wreck

752
01:08:25.470 --> 01:08:27.449
bringing a child into this
world with you would be.

753
01:08:27.450 --> 01:08:30.569
- If I had a kid. I'd
actually spent time with her

754
01:08:30.570 --> 01:08:32.498
instead of pawning her
off on some fucking nanny

755
01:08:32.499 --> 01:08:34.229
for 60 hours a week.

756
01:08:34.230 --> 01:08:35.339
- Yeah. And she'd get the pleasure

757
01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:38.039
of watching you pass out in
your own vomit every night.

758
01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:38.873
Right.

759
01:08:38.874 --> 01:08:40.529
- Yeah. you'd make an
award-winning parent. Miles.

760
01:08:40.530 --> 01:08:42.599
- Oh. and you're the fucking
soccer mom of the year.

761
01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:43.433
I'm sure.

762
01:08:43.434 --> 01:08:44.819
- She knows I love the shit out of her.

763
01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:46.739
And I do everything to provide for her.

764
01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:49.019
And so does Adam. by the way.

765
01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:52.109
- Fuck that guy. Does he
ever turn it off? Ever?

766
01:08:52.110 --> 01:08:55.088
- Oh my God. Jealous much?

767
01:08:55.089 --> 01:08:57.959
- Of that guy. Get the fuck out of here.

768
01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:00.689
- You brought this all on yourself.

769
01:09:00.690 --> 01:09:03.929
Why can't you just admit
it? You're a drunk.

770
01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:07.559
You're a wash up. You're a
tired rock and roll shithead.

771
01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.479
Who would rather wallow him self pity

772
01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:10.930
than just admit he was wrong?

773
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.253
You made your bed. You
can fucking lie in it.

774
01:13:05.375 --> 01:13:06.792
- She's your kid.

775
01:13:07.658 --> 01:13:08.658
- What?

776
01:13:09.342 --> 01:13:10.342
- Addison.

777
01:13:13.893 --> 01:13:17.223
She's not Adam's. she's yours.

778
01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:22.777
I knew it right away.

779
01:13:22.778 --> 01:13:26.620
But the thought of our relationship

780
01:13:28.410 --> 01:13:33.410
destroying some innocent kids'
life. it just was too much.

781
01:13:35.476 --> 01:13:37.803
So I lied.

782
01:13:40.976 --> 01:13:43.773
I lied. That's why I came.

783
01:13:48.930 --> 01:13:51.299
They threatened to tell you everything.

784
01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:53.927
There was no way I was
gonna let that happen. so.

785
01:15:38.223 --> 01:15:40.169
This is JB. I can't take your call.

786
01:15:40.170 --> 01:15:42.989
Just slaving away on my next masterpiece.

787
01:15:42.990 --> 01:15:44.279
Leave a message.

788
01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:47.399
It's me. I've
tried you a few times

789
01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:48.700
but you haven't picked up.

790
01:15:49.547 --> 01:15:51.689
I hope you're doing okay.

791
01:15:51.690 --> 01:15:54.040
I hope New York is all
you dreamed it would be.

792
01:15:55.153 --> 01:15:58.199
I want you to be happy. I really do.

793
01:15:58.200 --> 01:15:59.812
I always have. but there's

794
01:15:59.813 --> 01:16:02.690
there's something you should know.

795
01:16:02.691 --> 01:16:03.774
I'm pregnant.

796
01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:07.259
I don't expect you to come back.

797
01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:08.489
I don't expect anything.

798
01:16:08.490 --> 01:16:12.052
I just thought you would want to know.

799
01:16:12.053 --> 01:16:14.780
For more options. press four.

800
01:16:14.781 --> 01:16:16.082
To cancel. press star.

801
01:16:16.083 --> 01:16:17.500
Message deleted.

802
01:16:26.065 --> 01:16:28.590
- Oh. come on. Hang in there. Miles.

803
01:16:55.374 --> 01:16:56.707
- What? Tell me.

804
01:16:59.252 --> 01:17:02.131
- I just wanna remember this moment.

805
01:17:02.132 --> 01:17:05.132
This moment for the rest of my life.

806
01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:28.457
- Now we're talking.

807
01:19:39.128 --> 01:19:42.085
Last song on the album. kiddos.

808
01:19:42.086 --> 01:19:44.503
You got one more left in you?

809
01:19:47.195 --> 01:19:48.945
- What are you doing?

810
01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:52.503
- It's over. You know the truth now.

811
01:19:53.940 --> 01:19:55.490
There's no point in continuing.

812
01:19:56.370 --> 01:19:58.469
They deserve to be together.

813
01:19:58.470 --> 01:20:01.353
- Fuck this guy. He does not deserve her.

814
01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:03.773
- All right. maybe not.

815
01:20:03.774 --> 01:20:06.329
But his future kid deserves to know him.

816
01:20:06.330 --> 01:20:07.949
And you deserve whatever
you were promised.

817
01:20:07.950 --> 01:20:12.220
So you won. Congratulations.

818
01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:17.909
- Look. I was wrong. okay?

819
01:20:17.910 --> 01:20:20.399
Let's let the guy have his success.

820
01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:23.669
He's worked hard for it. He
shouldn't have to throw it away.

821
01:20:23.670 --> 01:20:25.109
It's what he wants.

822
01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:27.333
- No. it isn't.

823
01:20:28.230 --> 01:20:30.280
He went to New York because he was scared

824
01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:33.059
because he thought if he
didn't. he'd always regret it

825
01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:34.739
and he would blame her
for making him choose.

826
01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:36.993
But deep down. he's always known.

827
01:20:39.630 --> 01:20:42.963
The best art he ever did
was when he was with her.

828
01:20:45.090 --> 01:20:48.573
You won. okay? See it through.

829
01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:51.860
- That's just not gonna happen.

830
01:20:52.830 --> 01:20:54.869
- What's it gonna be. you two?

831
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:56.699
We don't have all night.

832
01:20:56.700 --> 01:20:58.150
- Why does he have to choose?

833
01:21:01.020 --> 01:21:03.753
- Shit. She's right.

834
01:21:04.650 --> 01:21:08.043
- That a girl. Almost there.

835
01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:10.275
- What do you mean?

836
01:21:10.276 --> 01:21:11.566
- Why can't he have both?

837
01:21:11.567 --> 01:21:13.563
- 'Cause life doesn't work that way.

838
01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:16.900
- Says who?

839
01:21:17.587 --> 01:21:19.293
- Rock and roll. sister.

840
01:21:24.149 --> 01:21:26.279
- All right. Jerry. how much time we got?

841
01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:28.143
- Until the rooster crows. rockstar?

842
01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:30.929
Play it like you mean it.

843
01:21:30.930 --> 01:21:33.269
- Always. Count us down. Moony.

844
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:35.029
- My pleasure.

845
01:27:54.343 --> 01:27:56.993
Time's up. The
moment of truth has arrived.

846
01:28:24.150 --> 01:28:25.360
- Son of a bitch.

847
01:28:27.030 --> 01:28:30.149
- Sorry. Charlie. It was a valiant effort.

848
01:28:30.150 --> 01:28:32.129
But you know how it goes.

849
01:28:32.130 --> 01:28:34.323
Sometimes you rock. sometimes you roll.

850
01:28:37.260 --> 01:28:38.969
- It's my fault.

851
01:28:38.970 --> 01:28:40.649
- It's nobody's fault.

852
01:28:40.650 --> 01:28:43.739
It was his decision to
make. and who knows?

853
01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:45.140
Maybe this is the right one.

854
01:28:46.050 --> 01:28:47.189
- Well. I guess it's time

855
01:28:47.190 --> 01:28:49.859
to put the chairs back on the tables.

856
01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:52.192
It was nice working with you again.

857
01:28:52.193 --> 01:28:53.860
Until the next time.

858
01:28:55.932 --> 01:29:00.296
Yes.

859
01:29:00.297 --> 01:29:01.919
Okay. Ciao.

860
01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:04.559
Okay. that was Walter Sinclair

861
01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:07.559
who owns a tower on 50th
or wherever. among others.

862
01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:10.799
And whose wife loves
young attractive artists

863
01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:12.543
and who loves to shop. Oh my Lord.

864
01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:15.599
If she were only to buy one.

865
01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:16.773
- Stop the car.

866
01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:19.709
Stop the car now. I want to get out.

867
01:29:19.710 --> 01:29:21.149
What. what. what are you doing?

868
01:29:21.150 --> 01:29:22.550
- Look. I don't belong here.

869
01:29:23.687 --> 01:29:25.619
- It's okay. It's okay. We're fine.

870
01:29:25.620 --> 01:29:27.820
Could you pull
the damn car over now?

871
01:29:29.621 --> 01:29:30.621
- Can you calm down?

872
01:29:32.751 --> 01:29:33.751
- I am.

873
01:29:34.590 --> 01:29:37.409
I've never been more calm my entire life.

874
01:29:37.410 --> 01:29:41.489
I know exactly. exactly
what it is that I want.

875
01:29:41.490 --> 01:29:43.169
- Can you please not do this to me?

876
01:29:43.170 --> 01:29:44.970
Do you know how much this limo cost?

877
01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:47.999
Okay. fine.

878
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.649
You know. that. that's fine.

879
01:29:49.650 --> 01:29:52.793
Be the reclusive hermit.
It's okay. I can sell it.

880
01:29:52.794 --> 01:29:54.153
I'll call you later.

881
01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:56.590
- It's over. Klaus.

882
01:29:57.920 --> 01:29:59.253
Tell Georgia goodbye.

883
01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:03.113
- I'll call you later.
Everything's going to be beautiful.

884
01:30:04.443 --> 01:30:05.493
- Goodbye. Klaus.

885
01:30:08.370 --> 01:30:09.749
- What do we do?

886
01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:11.939
- I don't know. Jerry. what do we do?

887
01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:13.589
- What do we do?

888
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:15.453
Hmm. That's a tough one.

889
01:30:16.350 --> 01:30:18.723
I'm kidding. Play something.

890
01:30:21.610 --> 01:30:23.965
- I don't know what to play.

891
01:30:23.966 --> 01:30:27.539
- Hey. let's play that last
song we ever wrote together.

892
01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:28.840
The one we never finished.

893
01:30:30.340 --> 01:30:31.349
- Perfect.

894
01:30:31.350 --> 01:30:33.209
Let's go. gang. Make it snappy.

895
01:30:33.210 --> 01:30:34.043
- Taxi!

896
01:30:34.044 --> 01:30:35.789
- All right. Jerry. let's go. Roll tape.

897
01:30:35.790 --> 01:30:36.899
- Roger that.

898
01:30:36.900 --> 01:30:39.742
Ground control to Wayward Son.

899
01:30:39.743 --> 01:30:41.410
Prepare for reentry.

900
01:33:28.985 --> 01:33:31.402
- I knew you would come back.

901
01:33:32.507 --> 01:33:35.174
I don't know how. but I. I knew.

902
01:33:41.029 --> 01:33:42.623
- Look. I don't have all the answers.

903
01:33:43.696 --> 01:33:45.363
I don't know what my purpose is.

904
01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:48.089
All I know is that I had to come back.

905
01:33:48.090 --> 01:33:50.840
That whatever meaning there
is to be found in this life

906
01:33:52.950 --> 01:33:54.300
I want to find it with you.

907
01:33:56.910 --> 01:33:59.099
No matter how
grand or unimpressive?

908
01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:01.263
- No matter how grand or unimpressive.

909
01:34:03.810 --> 01:34:05.783
And is should've done
this a long time ago.

910
01:34:10.140 --> 01:34:11.590
Will you make my life better?

911
01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:19.697
- Yeah. You bet I will.

912
01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:18.149
- Beautiful work. bothers and sisters.

913
01:36:18.150 --> 01:36:19.739
I knew you had it in you.

914
01:36:19.740 --> 01:36:21.239
I'd love to stay and celebrate.

915
01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:23.849
But I got a date with a
bottle of Johnnie Walker

916
01:36:23.850 --> 01:36:26.309
and Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On.

917
01:36:26.310 --> 01:36:29.759
So I'll be catching you on the flip side.

918
01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:30.843
Stay cool now.

919
01:36:35.310 --> 01:36:36.719
- Miles?

920
01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:37.720
- Yeah.

921
01:36:39.201 --> 01:36:40.439
Can you do me a favor?

922
01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:41.440
- What's that?

923
01:36:43.385 --> 01:36:44.385
- Pinch me?

924
01:36:46.860 --> 01:36:47.860
Ow. thank you.

925
01:37:11.205 --> 01:37:13.199
- You gonna be okay?

926
01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:15.506
- Yeah. You?

927
01:37:15.507 --> 01:37:19.143
- You know me. Certified
rock and roll survivor.

928
01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:22.954
- You gonna tell anyone about this?

929
01:37:22.955 --> 01:37:24.393
- No. not a soul.

930
01:37:25.938 --> 01:37:27.303
- No. me neither.

931
01:37:29.070 --> 01:37:33.963
I would. I'd like you to spend
some. some time with her.

932
01:37:35.429 --> 01:37:37.513
I mean. if you. if you want to.

933
01:37:38.997 --> 01:37:40.409
- Are you sure?

934
01:37:40.410 --> 01:37:42.929
- Yeah. I mean. it would have to be slow

935
01:37:42.930 --> 01:37:44.249
right at first. just 'cause I think

936
01:37:44.250 --> 01:37:45.968
it would be a lot for her to take in.

937
01:37:45.969 --> 01:37:47.219
But. you know.

938
01:37:50.630 --> 01:37:54.783
- So for now. Uncle Miles.

939
01:37:55.890 --> 01:37:58.053
- Yeah. I like that.

940
01:37:59.220 --> 01:38:00.893
- It's got a pretty good ring to it.

941
01:38:09.723 --> 01:38:11.423
I'll see you around. Lizard Queen.

942
01:38:24.270 --> 01:38:26.969
Well. what do you
know? Miracles do happen.

943
01:38:26.970 --> 01:38:30.959
It's been five long years.
but the wait is finally over.

944
01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:34.229
Here's "Seaworthy". the title
track off a brand new album

945
01:38:34.230 --> 01:38:37.979
from Circus Patrol on KTPW.

946
01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:39.059
You're listening to

947
01:38:39.060 --> 01:38:42.893
only the best radio
station in the universe.

948
01:44:45.064 --> 01:44:46.064
- Okay.

949
01:44:48.060 --> 01:44:49.510
Could you step on it. please?

950
01:44:51.480 --> 01:44:54.180
Cut. That was
great. All right. Let's go.
