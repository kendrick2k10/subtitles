They're a priority.
I need you to fall back. Over.

96
00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:54.250
Truck's too close to our men

No launcher visible in my feed.

105
00:05:15.458 --> 00:05:17.791
-Fire request denied.
-I'm positive that's a launcher. sir.

106
00:05:17.875 --> 00:05:19.333
Impact is imminent. Over.

107
00:05:19.416 --> 00:05:20.541
You heard him!

108
00:05:20.625 --> 00:05:21.958
Hold fire till I clear my men!

109
00:05:22.041 --> 00:05:23.208
We have 38 men on ground.

110
00:05:23.291 --> 00:05:25.083
plus two exposed. They'll all die.

111
00:05:25.166 --> 00:05:26.166

00:05:32.541 --> 00:05:34.000

-Go!
-[shouting]

117
00:05:35.625 --> 00:05:37.083

-What are you doing. Harp?
-[beeping]

125
00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.291
DA1 off the rail on three…

126
00:05:53.375 --> 00:05:55.125
-Stand down.
-[beeping]

127
00:05:55.208 --> 00:05:56.291
-[Harp] …two.
-[sighs]

128
00:05:57.416 --> 00:05:58.666
-…one.
-[beeping]

129
00:06:01.583 --> 00:06:02.916

[screams]

132
00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.041
Goddammit. Harp!

133
00:06:21.708 --> 00:06:24.291
[indistinct radio chatter]

134
00:06:24.375 --> 00:06:25.666
[breathes heavily]

135
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:26.875
What the fuck. Harp?

136
00:06:27.375 --> 00:06:28.875
You disobeyed a direct order.

137
00:06:29.583 --> 00:06:31.125
[Sgt.] You son of a bitch!

138
00:06:32.208 --> 00:06:33.291
You killed 'em!

139
00:06:36.041 --> 00:06:37.500
You killed 'em!

140
00:06:39.791 --> 00:06:43.375
[intense music playing]

141
00:07:03.666 --> 00:07:05.000
[Brydon] Two US Marines.

142
00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:06.958
Dead.

143
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.833
And one US Army Gump destroyed.

144
00:07:16.625 --> 00:07:19.500
I made the call that felt most correct
given the intel available--

145
00:07:19.583 --> 00:07:20.666
[Brydon] At the time.

146
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.083
We know.

147
00:07:22.791 --> 00:07:26.208
With all due respect. Captain.
with 40 men on the ground. I saved 38.

148
00:07:26.291 --> 00:07:28.666
including Master Sergeant Miller
and his convoy.

149
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.208
If Miller had been given the chance.
he would've tried to save all 40.

150
00:07:33.291 --> 00:07:35.250
But you took that option away from him.

151
00:07:39.083 --> 00:07:40.500
When did you do your basic?

152
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:42.666
Three years ago. Parris Island.

153
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.833
Have you ever experienced
a mass-casualty encounter.

154
00:07:44.916 --> 00:07:46.708
other than from behind your screen?

155
00:07:50.291 --> 00:07:52.541
Have you spent time
in a conflict zone. Harp?

156
00:07:52.625 --> 00:07:55.208
-No. ma'am. but I--
-Thank you. Lieutenant.

157
00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.291
Here's your deployment drive.

158
00:08:01.875 --> 00:08:04.250
Captain. this can't be the only option.

159
00:08:04.333 --> 00:08:06.000
They wanted to court-martial you.

160
00:08:06.083 --> 00:08:08.458
-I fought for you.
-What am I gonna tell Olivia?

161
00:08:08.541 --> 00:08:10.875
Tell her you're going on
an all-expenses-paid refresher

162
00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.500
in how to make the world a safer place.

163
00:08:12.583 --> 00:08:14.958
-Until when?
-Until you pass the assessment.

164
00:08:15.041 --> 00:08:16.541
And when's that gonna be?

165
00:08:20.416 --> 00:08:21.750
When's that gonna be. sir?

166
00:08:23.916 --> 00:08:25.208
I like you. Harp.

167
00:08:25.291 --> 00:08:27.416
You're precise. efficient.
Brilliant drone pilot.

168
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.791
But you disobeyed a direct order.

169
00:08:30.291 --> 00:08:32.083
Consider yourself lucky today.

170
00:08:32.791 --> 00:08:35.375
Your CO at Camp Nathaniel
is a Captain Leo.

171
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:37.208
Report to him.

172
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.583
Camp Nathaniel?
That's where the platoon's based.

173
00:08:42.666 --> 00:08:44.416
Keep your head down.
See it as an opportunity

174
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.083
to meet your fellow servicemen.

175
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:48.791
Let's pray you're a fast learner.

176
00:08:48.875 --> 00:08:49.791
Dismissed.

177
00:08:57.791 --> 00:09:00.125
[whirring]

178
00:09:05.208 --> 00:09:07.791
-[buzzer]
-[man 1] Let's go. guys. Let's get moving!

179
00:09:07.875 --> 00:09:09.458
Straight ahead. straight ahead.

180
00:09:10.458 --> 00:09:13.875
Move it. soldier.
This is your new home. maggots.

181
00:09:14.583 --> 00:09:17.083
Get into three separate lines
to get scanned in.

182
00:09:17.166 --> 00:09:20.500
-Pronto! Double-time! Move!
-[aircraft roars overhead]

183
00:09:20.583 --> 00:09:21.791
Welcome to Camp Nathaniel.

184
00:09:21.875 --> 00:09:24.000
You'll be seeing a lot of my pretty face.

185
00:09:24.083 --> 00:09:26.166
Get scanned in by the Gumps
and keep it moving.

186
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:28.916
Your digs are in Sections 2 and 4.
ahead on your left.

187
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.208
Keep it moving. soldier.

188
00:09:30.291 --> 00:09:32.583
Let's go. What are you waiting for?

189
00:09:32.666 --> 00:09:33.708
Come on! Don't be shy.

190
00:09:33.791 --> 00:09:36.041
-[beeping]
-Look at them straight in the eye.

191
00:09:36.125 --> 00:09:37.708
-Do not hesitate.
-[Gump beeps]

192
00:09:37.791 --> 00:09:41.583
[man 1] They smell fear. boys.
Keep it moving. soldiers. Come on!

193
00:09:41.666 --> 00:09:45.208
Hey. eyes on the prize. soldier.
Eyes on the prize. Come on.

194
00:09:45.291 --> 00:09:48.958
Left foot. right foot. keep it going.
Why are you being so slow? Come on!

195
00:09:49.041 --> 00:09:51.541
Excuse me.
Hi. I'm looking for Captain Leo.

196
00:09:52.791 --> 00:09:54.833
-Sorry. I'm looking for Captain Leo.
-Leo?

197
00:09:54.916 --> 00:09:58.125
Oh man. I don't know.
You better talk to Colonel Eckhart.

198
00:09:58.208 --> 00:10:00.666
-He's by the medical tent right there.
-Thank you.

199
00:10:02.083 --> 00:10:02.916
[growling]

200
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.666
[man 1] Hey! I am not gonna let my men
be out on inspection here. Move!

201
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:08.708
[man 2] Make room. Got another one coming.

202
00:10:08.791 --> 00:10:10.041
[Harp] Colonel Eckhart?

203
00:10:11.291 --> 00:10:12.500
Lieutenant Harp. sir.

204
00:10:12.583 --> 00:10:15.750
Posted here from Creech Air Force Base.
Looking for Captain Leo.

205
00:10:15.833 --> 00:10:18.833
[laughs] You must've really fucked up
if they sent you to Leo.

206
00:10:18.916 --> 00:10:20.333
What do you mean. sir?

207
00:10:20.416 --> 00:10:22.791
You don't have permission to speak
until I ask you a question.

208
00:10:24.375 --> 00:10:26.250
You even know why you're here?

209
00:10:26.333 --> 00:10:29.291
-Experientum Auctoriat. sir.
-"Authority of experience."

210
00:10:29.375 --> 00:10:31.958
Don't give it a Latin name. shit.
Explain it to me.

211
00:10:32.583 --> 00:10:35.041
Uh. it's an Ethics Committee dictate. sir.

212
00:10:35.125 --> 00:10:39.083
It proposes UAV pilots would exercise
greater caution if they experienced--

213
00:10:39.166 --> 00:10:41.458
The Ethics Committee is a PR team.

214
00:10:41.541 --> 00:10:44.541
This dictate is a bullshit pass
for pilots who fuck up.

215
00:10:45.166 --> 00:10:47.416
You killed two marines.
You should be in jail.

216
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.916
Someone deemed
the dollar value of your training

217
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.541
to be higher than the lives
of those two men.

218
00:10:54.625 --> 00:10:57.291
If you survive. Air Force keeps a pilot.

219
00:10:57.791 --> 00:11:01.875
You don't. you're a cautionary tale
to all the other fly-by-wire assholes.

220
00:11:03.125 --> 00:11:06.250
-With all due respect. sir--
-I didn't ask you a question. son.

221
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:16.375
Block 13. Follow the music.

222
00:11:18.583 --> 00:11:19.750
Thank you. Colonel.

223
00:11:21.375 --> 00:11:22.208
[Eckhart] Harp…

224
00:11:23.416 --> 00:11:24.875
…he's not like us.

225
00:11:26.458 --> 00:11:28.583
[mechanical footsteps]

226
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.083
[man] This is ridiculous.

227
00:11:40.666 --> 00:11:43.041
Can you believe
we have to read all this and file it?

228
00:11:56.375 --> 00:11:57.916
[door creaks]

229
00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:58.875
[loud clang]

230
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.333
Shh!

231
00:12:01.208 --> 00:12:02.250
Be quiet!

232
00:12:17.791 --> 00:12:20.666
[Gump whirs]

233
00:12:22.125 --> 00:12:24.125
[whirs and beeps]

234
00:12:39.791 --> 00:12:44.125
[female announcer] Remaining charging time
for Gump unit C-45. 20 minutes.

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:52.541

237
00:13:00.625 --> 00:13:01.833
Are you Captain Leo?

238
00:13:02.833 --> 00:13:06.333
[jazz song continues]

239
00:13:17.125 --> 00:13:19.583
[man hums]

00:13:22.083 --> 00:13:25.958
[hums along quietly]

242
00:13:26.041 --> 00:13:27.291
Lieutenant Harp. sir.

243
00:13:29.625 --> 00:13:32.041
[continues humming]

244
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:37.083
-My deployment drive. sir.

[keyboard clicks]

247
00:13:55.041 --> 00:13:56.625
Lieutenant Thomas Harp.

248
00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.250
Tier three UAV pilot.

00:13:59.333 --> 00:14:02.083

99% performance record.
and 99% discipline.

00:14:05.416 --> 00:14:09.333
Engaged to Olivia Rose Meyer of Carlsbad.

252
00:14:10.333 --> 00:14:12.333
To be married in Palm Springs.

253
00:14:12.916 --> 00:14:14.791
It's a very nice part of the world.

254
00:14:15.458 --> 00:14:18.125
Did I leave anything out
other than your kills and commendations

255
00:14:18.208 --> 00:14:20.458
or the fact
that you can't appreciate culture.

256
00:14:20.541 --> 00:14:22.916
or you just don't know
when to shut the fuck up?

257
00:14:24.166 --> 00:14:25.875
-No.
-No. Captain.

258
00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:26.958
No. Captain.

259
00:14:27.041 --> 00:14:28.000
[Leo] Very good.

260
00:14:29.333 --> 00:14:31.666
How many insurgents have you killed. Harp?

261
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:33.708
-163.
-Collateral?

262
00:14:34.833 --> 00:14:37.833
My numbers are consistent
with mission goals and flight hours. sir.

263
00:14:37.916 --> 00:14:39.875
Your numbers? [chuckles]

264
00:14:40.333 --> 00:14:43.666
Goddamn. you a cold motherfucker. [laughs]

265
00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:45.583
Here.

266
00:14:47.125 --> 00:14:48.541
Grab that and follow me.

267
00:14:54.625 --> 00:14:57.333
Far too many names
to memorize and recite. sir.

268
00:14:58.125 --> 00:15:00.708
If you could. would you really want to?

269
00:15:01.875 --> 00:15:03.583
I'm aware we kill people. Captain.

270
00:15:03.666 --> 00:15:05.833
If you were aware of that.
you wouldn't be here.

271
00:15:09.083 --> 00:15:10.291
You a quartermaster?

272
00:15:11.375 --> 00:15:12.250
If I were…

273
00:15:13.208 --> 00:15:14.333
would you be disappointed?

274
00:15:15.125 --> 00:15:18.583
-Why would I be disappointed?
-'Cause that means you flew 10.000 miles

275
00:15:18.666 --> 00:15:20.375
to sign equipment out of a warehouse.

276
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:22.750
We all play our part.

277
00:15:22.833 --> 00:15:24.541
The fuck do you think you are?

278
00:15:25.125 --> 00:15:26.291
Some Academy kid?

279
00:15:27.166 --> 00:15:30.791
Daddy pay your way through cadet school
so you could mind your Ps and Qs?

280
00:15:32.666 --> 00:15:36.625
With all due respect.
I put myself through cadet school.

281
00:15:41.666 --> 00:15:42.500
Sir.

282
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:45.833
No.

283
00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.083
No what. Captain?

284
00:15:50.166 --> 00:15:51.958
[Leo] No. I'm not a quartermaster.

285
00:15:53.166 --> 00:15:55.416
We have to deliver
these vaccines to a clinic.

286
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.791
Twenty klicks outside the wire.

287
00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:01.666
There's an outbreak of cholera.
and it's spreading fast.

288
00:16:02.541 --> 00:16:05.791
It might be a war zone.
but women and children still get sick.

289
00:16:07.166 --> 00:16:08.875
So you're "hearts and minds." sir?

290
00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.750
Yes. I'm hearts and minds.

291
00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:13.250
Ostensibly. [chuckles lightly]

292
00:16:13.333 --> 00:16:14.666
So. what do you really do?

293
00:16:15.708 --> 00:16:16.791
I chase ghosts.

294
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.208
-I'm sorry. what?
-[Leo chuckles]

295
00:16:20.291 --> 00:16:23.541
MARSOC. Marine Special Operations.

296
00:16:23.625 --> 00:16:28.250
I locate and remove advanced weapons
from insurgents beyond the wire.

297
00:16:30.416 --> 00:16:33.291
And what do you do?
Put them in filing cabinets?

298
00:16:33.375 --> 00:16:35.583
It's the latest
in counter-intel technology.

299
00:16:35.666 --> 00:16:38.166
Beats the hell out
of those Russian hackers.

300
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:40.500
It's your NDA.

301
00:16:41.416 --> 00:16:44.416
-You can sign it or read all 90 pages.
-Oh. No. sir.

302
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:50.916
Welcome. Lieutenant.

303
00:16:53.666 --> 00:16:55.916
You ever heard the name Viktor Koval?

304
00:16:57.416 --> 00:17:01.208
Yeah. Heard insurgents say it
on intercepted radio comms.

305
00:17:01.291 --> 00:17:04.458
Forget what you heard in the air.
You're on the ground now. kid.

306
00:17:05.625 --> 00:17:08.000
Viktor Koval is a Krasny warlord.

307
00:17:09.375 --> 00:17:12.875
The Krasny wanna make
the Ukraine a part of Russia.

308
00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:16.375
-[Harp] Like in the good old days.
-Opposing them

309
00:17:16.916 --> 00:17:18.125
are the Resistance.

310
00:17:18.208 --> 00:17:21.750
They're a militia set up to defend
the independence of the Ukraine.

311
00:17:21.833 --> 00:17:25.458
But the Krasnys are getting stronger
with the full support of Moscow.

312
00:17:25.541 --> 00:17:27.750
It's a war that's got too hot for the UN.

313
00:17:27.833 --> 00:17:30.541
so now we're the assholes
in the middle of it.

314
00:17:30.625 --> 00:17:32.333
in the demilitarized zone.

315
00:17:33.166 --> 00:17:34.291
We're peacekeepers.

316
00:17:34.916 --> 00:17:38.166
We're the only thing stopping these guys
from committing genocide.

317
00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:41.041
You believe that. I have a timeshare
in Florida I want to sell you.

318
00:17:42.333 --> 00:17:46.791
No. we're talking about Viktor Koval.
the Terror of the Balkans.

319
00:17:52.083 --> 00:17:52.916
And nukes.

320
00:17:55.208 --> 00:17:56.041
Nukes?

321
00:17:56.833 --> 00:18:00.083
There's Intel that says
Koval is responsible for the dirty bomb

322
00:18:00.166 --> 00:18:01.291
set off in Kiev.

323
00:18:02.041 --> 00:18:03.500
using Russian uranium.

324
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.166
This motherfucker may be responsible
for 25.000 people's deaths.

325
00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:10.625
My sources tell me he's trying
to get to Systema Perimeter.

326
00:18:11.291 --> 00:18:13.083
Systema Perimeter?

327
00:18:13.166 --> 00:18:15.875
That's Russia's
automated nuclear retaliation system.

328
00:18:16.625 --> 00:18:17.750
[Leo] Exactly.

329
00:18:17.833 --> 00:18:20.083
Even after Ukraine's independence.

330
00:18:20.166 --> 00:18:23.458
the country still held one-third
of Russia's nuclear arsenal.

331
00:18:23.541 --> 00:18:27.041
Silos scattered across the country
at top-secret locations.

332
00:18:27.125 --> 00:18:29.541
ready to strike anywhere in the world.

333
00:18:33.708 --> 00:18:34.583
Yeah.

334
00:18:35.083 --> 00:18:38.666
But it was shut down like 50 years ago.
after the Cold War.

335
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:39.750
You believe that?

336
00:18:40.708 --> 00:18:44.750
You really think Russia would dismantle
its one true safeguard against attack?

337
00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:48.666
You telling me
the Russian systems are still functioning?

338
00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:50.125
And Koval…

339
00:18:51.458 --> 00:18:53.875
he's trying to get
to the nukes here in Ukraine?

340
00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:57.208
CIA sources say that
the Kremlin's lost control of Koval.

341
00:18:57.791 --> 00:19:00.958
My informant believes
Koval's gonna make a move for those nukes

342
00:19:01.041 --> 00:19:02.291
in the next 24 hours.

343
00:19:03.375 --> 00:19:05.208
And if all this is true.

344
00:19:05.291 --> 00:19:08.208
imagine what he'll do
if he gets his hands on those silos.

345
00:19:08.291 --> 00:19:09.833
Yeah. A madman with nukes.

346
00:19:09.916 --> 00:19:12.166
A crazy terrorist with nukes.

347
00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:15.750
Downtown Washington.
New York. Paris. Who knows?

348
00:19:15.833 --> 00:19:19.833
What I do know is. there won't be
a pretty little wedding in Palm Springs.

349
00:19:19.916 --> 00:19:22.875
unless you're wearing
factor 500 UV protection.

350
00:19:26.458 --> 00:19:29.041
Now. we deliver
these vaccines to the hospital.

351
00:19:29.125 --> 00:19:32.166
and my informant will
feed us intel on Koval's next plan.

352
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:34.000
We ride out at dawn.

353
00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:35.791
Dawn?

354
00:19:36.291 --> 00:19:38.166
But that's… now!

355
00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:39.750
Whoa. uh. Captain.

356
00:19:39.833 --> 00:19:40.916
Uh. Sir?

357
00:19:43.458 --> 00:19:46.125
With all due respect. sir.
I think there's been a mistake.

358
00:19:46.208 --> 00:19:47.291
I just got here.

359
00:19:47.375 --> 00:19:49.416
[Leo] I don't make mistakes. Lieutenant.

360
00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.625
[Harp] No. I don't mean it like that. sir.

361
00:19:56.375 --> 00:19:58.458
Dress. Lieutenant. Double-time.

362
00:19:59.125 --> 00:20:00.166
What's this?

363
00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:03.291
You wear your uniform.
you'll be a standing target.

364
00:20:07.583 --> 00:20:10.166
-Thought I'd be guarding the fence. sir.
-[chuckles]

365
00:20:11.291 --> 00:20:13.958
I don't have any specialist training
as a field agent.

366
00:20:14.458 --> 00:20:17.666
Don't worry.
I'm special enough for both of us.

367
00:20:19.833 --> 00:20:21.833
[buzzing]

368
00:20:28.583 --> 00:20:29.416
What the fuck?

369
00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.083
What the fuck. Captain.

370
00:20:35.791 --> 00:20:37.875
-You're a--
-Your commanding officer.

371
00:20:37.958 --> 00:20:39.291
Fourth-generation biotech.

372
00:20:39.375 --> 00:20:41.916
and I'm gonna give you
60 seconds to deal with it.

373
00:20:45.333 --> 00:20:47.791
I'm-- I'm sorry. what. Captain?
[clears throat]

374
00:20:48.833 --> 00:20:51.041
Do you feel as though
you can trust me. Harp?

375
00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:54.000
-I. uh--
-[Leo] We're about to enter a war zone.

376
00:20:54.083 --> 00:20:56.666
If I continue
to instill shock and distrust.

377
00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:58.625
I'll file your removal papers myself.

378
00:20:58.708 --> 00:21:01.375
and you'll have to deal
with the consequences.

379
00:21:01.958 --> 00:21:04.875
[solemn music playing]

380
00:21:10.666 --> 00:21:11.500
Now…

381
00:21:12.708 --> 00:21:13.833
do you trust me?

382
00:21:15.708 --> 00:21:16.625
Yes. sir.

383
00:21:20.708 --> 00:21:21.583
Cool.

384
00:21:29.125 --> 00:21:30.833
So. what are you? Like. AI?

385
00:21:30.916 --> 00:21:34.083
Your cell phone's AI. A Gump's AI.

386
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.250
I'm a prototype.
My existence is classified.

387
00:21:37.333 --> 00:21:39.166
You're evading the question. sir.

388
00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:42.250
[Leo] Ask the right question.
I'll give you the right answer.

389
00:21:42.333 --> 00:21:44.750
-[soldier laughs]
-[man] Go again?

390
00:21:44.833 --> 00:21:47.125
Okay. What the hell are you?

391
00:21:49.083 --> 00:21:51.291
You want my model number or tech specs?

392
00:21:51.375 --> 00:21:52.500
Both are classified.

393
00:21:52.583 --> 00:21:54.208
-[soldiers laugh]
-Yo!

394
00:21:54.791 --> 00:21:55.666
Oh. ten-hut!

395
00:21:57.208 --> 00:21:58.916
The fuck are you doing?

396
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.333
Some asshole in Arlington thinks
a vending machine can do a soldier's job.

397
00:22:05.583 --> 00:22:08.333
-Aside from that. it's got a fucked rotor.
-[Gump beeps]

398
00:22:08.416 --> 00:22:11.666
You want me to take the butt of my gun
and bash your ugly fucking mug in?

399
00:22:14.375 --> 00:22:15.291
[Gump beeps]

400
00:22:15.375 --> 00:22:16.208
No. sir.

401
00:22:17.083 --> 00:22:18.291
Charlie Nine.

402
00:22:18.375 --> 00:22:20.375
-[Gump beeps and whirs]
-[Leo] Mount up.

403
00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.000
This way. Lieutenant.

404
00:22:23.583 --> 00:22:26.250
Only two people have clearance
to know who and what I am.

405
00:22:26.333 --> 00:22:27.875
Colonel Eckhart and you.

406
00:22:27.958 --> 00:22:32.000
Why was I assigned to you?
I'm not qualified to go chasing nukes.

407
00:22:32.083 --> 00:22:33.333
You weren't assigned.

408
00:22:33.916 --> 00:22:34.875
I chose you.

409
00:22:35.791 --> 00:22:38.083
I can't do this alone.
I need eyes on my back.

410
00:22:39.083 --> 00:22:41.791
I needed someone
who could think outside the box.

411
00:22:46.875 --> 00:22:47.750
You got me?

412
00:22:50.541 --> 00:22:51.666
So. we're partners?

413
00:22:52.833 --> 00:22:53.666
Fuck. no.

414
00:22:55.875 --> 00:22:57.208
You're my subordinate.

415
00:22:59.291 --> 00:23:01.833
You respect me like the rest
of your commanding officers.

416
00:23:01.916 --> 00:23:04.583
Don't question my authority.
and we'll get on fine.

417
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:07.083
Our jeep's over there.

418
00:23:08.416 --> 00:23:09.708
[indistinct yelling]

419
00:23:09.791 --> 00:23:11.416
-Captain.
-At ease. soldier.

420
00:23:12.416 --> 00:23:13.500
[scoffs] Subordinate.

421
00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:19.875
-Hey. drone boy!
-Come here.

422
00:23:20.458 --> 00:23:22.500
Hey! What the-- [groans]

423
00:23:22.583 --> 00:23:25.333
-[soldiers grunt]
-[Harp groans]

424
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.208
Stand down!

425
00:23:29.666 --> 00:23:30.958
You made your point.

426
00:23:32.333 --> 00:23:34.500
[Harp breathes heavily]

427
00:23:38.541 --> 00:23:40.833
You recognize my voice.
you son of a bitch?

428
00:23:43.583 --> 00:23:45.291
They were only 19 years old.

429
00:23:47.541 --> 00:23:49.625
Nothing I say will bring them back.

430
00:24:02.625 --> 00:24:04.125
What are you staring at?

431
00:24:05.041 --> 00:24:05.875
Load up.

432
00:24:05.958 --> 00:24:08.291
[propulsive music plays]

433
00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.083
[man] Report of hostile activities
in Sector 9.

434
00:24:12.166 --> 00:24:15.875
[radio chatter continues]

435
00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:29.375
Eleven miles to the city.

436
00:24:29.916 --> 00:24:32.958
We don't control
any of the area outside the wire.

437
00:24:33.541 --> 00:24:35.041
[buzzer sounds]

438
00:24:37.875 --> 00:24:40.208
-The Marines call it--
-"Running the gauntlet."

439
00:24:41.833 --> 00:24:43.708
Because attacks in it are so frequent.

440
00:24:43.791 --> 00:24:45.458
[chuckles] Good.

441
00:24:46.041 --> 00:24:48.125
-[radio beeps]
-[Miller] All units be advised.

442
00:24:48.208 --> 00:24:50.416
We are proceeding outside the wire.

443
00:24:54.583 --> 00:24:56.458
[Leo] Pick up your rifle. Lieutenant.

444
00:24:56.541 --> 00:24:59.541
If they attack.
you're gonna need to shoot back.

445
00:25:03.625 --> 00:25:04.541
[breathes heavily]

446
00:25:05.666 --> 00:25:08.083
[tense music playing]

447
00:25:25.375 --> 00:25:26.291

448
00:25:30.666 --> 00:25:32.458
[radio chatter]

449
00:25:32.541 --> 00:25:33.625
Must be nice.

450
00:25:34.166 --> 00:25:37.333
Fight a war. never have to leave home.

451
00:25:37.416 --> 00:25:39.541
[breathes deeply]

452
00:25:39.625 --> 00:25:41.458
When was the last time you saw her?

453
00:25:42.875 --> 00:25:44.833
-Saw who?
-What do you mean "who"?

454
00:25:44.916 --> 00:25:46.500
Olivia Rose Meyer.

455
00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:49.416
Last week.

456
00:25:49.916 --> 00:25:51.375
[Leo] Last week. Damn.

457
00:25:54.333 --> 00:25:57.958
[aircraft roars overhead]

458
00:26:01.125 --> 00:26:03.750
-You fucking somebody else?
-Get the fuck outta here.

459
00:26:03.833 --> 00:26:06.416
Come on. Look.
I get a sense of arrogance from you.

460
00:26:06.916 --> 00:26:09.625
Guys like you. so dispassionate. so cold.

461
00:26:09.708 --> 00:26:11.166
so into himself.

462
00:26:11.958 --> 00:26:15.500
-Those are the guys that usually wander.
-Yeah? Well. I'm faithful.

463
00:26:15.583 --> 00:26:17.791
-She faithful to you?
-Yeah. She is--

464
00:26:18.291 --> 00:26:20.666
[scoffs] Why am I even
having this conversation?

465
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:21.875
Fair game. rookie.

466
00:26:22.791 --> 00:26:27.000
I need your head out here.
not thinking about if Olivia's at home

467
00:26:27.083 --> 00:26:29.875
playing "put the beef in my taco"
with her Pilates instructor.

468
00:26:29.958 --> 00:26:33.666
-Her Pilates instructor's a woman.
-Oh. even better!

469
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:37.250
-She goes both ways. I knew I liked her.
-We're getting married in September.

470
00:26:37.333 --> 00:26:40.750
What do you know about relationships?
Aren't you like three years old?

471
00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:42.083
Five.

472
00:26:44.458 --> 00:26:45.958
You got a picture of her?

473
00:26:46.958 --> 00:26:48.500
Come on. man. Pull it out.

[Harp sighs]

475
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:54.916
Holy shit.

476
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.958
She's a hottie. Congratulations.

477
00:26:57.041 --> 00:26:58.791
-Thank you. She's special.
-Hey!

478
00:26:59.916 --> 00:27:02.958
"My Gummy Bear." [chuckles]
She calls you Gummy Bear?

479
00:27:03.666 --> 00:27:06.583
[laughs] Aww. my Gummy Bear.

480
00:27:06.666 --> 00:27:07.750

482
00:27:11.333 --> 00:27:12.583
Fucking with you. rookie.

-[radio beeps]
-[Miller] This is Rattlesnake.

484

-So. eyes open. Over.
-[radio beeps]

486
00:27:26.333 --> 00:27:29.958
[Leo] Look at these poor bastards.
Stuck between us and Koval.

487
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:33.166
[man] I got a bunch of civilians.
Nine o'clock.

488
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:37.541
No signs of hostile activity.

489

Keep your distance.

490
00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:49.791
[Miller] This is Rattlesnake.

491
00:27:49.875 --> 00:27:53.750
We have reports from base
of aid truck hit. Man down.

492

Road to encampment blocked.

494

496
00:28:01.416 --> 00:28:03.166

Hostiles in the area.

00:40:01.583 --> 00:40:02.750
Bring the other supplies.

700
00:40:10.416 --> 00:40:12.083
[in Russian] I'm in position.

701
00:40:15.791 --> 00:40:16.916
Viktor?

702
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.333
[Viktor. in Russian] Do you have
the incendiary rounds?

703
00:40:19.416 --> 00:40:20.708
[sniper] Mm-hmm.

704
00:40:21.833 --> 00:40:24.708
[Viktor. in Russian]
Kill him. Kill them both.

705
00:40:25.583 --> 00:40:27.125

[sniper grunts]

713
00:40:54.583 --> 00:40:55.791
[in Russian] Who are you?

-[screams]
-[Leo] Who are you?

715
00:41:00.833 --> 00:41:03.125
Fuck yourself. American pig!

716
00:41:03.208 --> 00:41:05.833
-[screams]
-I can do this all day.

717

[Leo] Krasny.

719
00:41:10.958 --> 00:41:13.083
What do you know about Viktor Koval?

720
00:41:13.166 --> 00:41:15.291
-[man] Give him to us. Americans.
-Tell me!

721
00:41:16.208 --> 00:41:19.916
I hit you in your subclavian artery.
You're gonna bleed out.

[gasps and grunts]

723
00:41:22.083 --> 00:41:23.583
So. where were we?

724
00:41:24.541 --> 00:41:25.750
[sniper groans]

725
00:41:25.833 --> 00:41:27.291
[Leo] Come on. Tell me!

726
00:41:27.833 --> 00:41:30.500
Or do you wanna spend
your final few moments

727
00:41:30.583 --> 00:41:31.750
with my friends here?

Suit yourself.

[splutters]

732
00:41:41.083 --> 00:41:42.125
Cap.

733
00:41:43.166 --> 00:41:45.000
Cap. he's still alive.

734

-[Leo] Not for long.
-[sniper chokes]

735
00:41:46.916 --> 00:41:48.000
[Leo] He's a fanatic.

736
00:41:48.708 --> 00:41:50.125
It always ends the same.

737
00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:53.750
Welcome to the war. kid.

[shouting and grunting]

741
00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.166
[Harp] Hey! What the fuck?

742
00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:07.125
-You gotta call this in.
-Nothing to call in yet.

743
00:42:07.708 --> 00:42:10.875
What are you talking about?
We got insurgents. We got a sniper.

744
00:42:10.958 --> 00:42:14.541
That's enough to get command to listen.
to commit a fucking task force--

745
00:42:14.625 --> 00:42:18.416
All we have is enough for command
to hold us up in bureaucracy three days

746
00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:21.500
while they consider
if Perimeter's even a conversation.

747
00:42:21.583 --> 00:42:23.375
We don't have that kind of time.

748
00:42:23.458 --> 00:42:27.375
If their spies and snipers are here.
that means Koval isn't that far behind.

749
00:42:27.458 --> 00:42:30.458
You said we'd deliver
the vaccines to get intel on Koval.

750
00:42:30.541 --> 00:42:32.083
Where the fuck are we going?

751
00:42:32.708 --> 00:42:34.791
I didn't say the intel was at the clinic.

752
00:42:34.875 --> 00:42:37.791
This is a live-fire scenario. son.
Think you can handle it?

753
00:42:37.875 --> 00:42:40.250
-Tell me what you're hiding.
-[Leo laughs]

754
00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:43.125
I'll walk back to base.
tell 'em you went rogue.

755
00:42:44.958 --> 00:42:46.625
Did your motherboard freeze?

756
00:42:49.083 --> 00:42:51.958
Stop staring at me like that.
Did your motherboard freeze?

757
00:42:52.708 --> 00:42:53.791
Say something!

758
00:42:54.791 --> 00:42:58.875
Why are you such
a pain in my motherfucking ass?

759

Get in the fucking truck.

-Who programmed you to curse so much?
-Nobody.

761
00:43:03.916 --> 00:43:06.333
I respond to the asshole
that's in front of me.

762
00:43:06.416 --> 00:43:08.375
-Now get in the fucking truck!
-No.

763
00:43:10.583 --> 00:43:11.916
I'm not getting in there.

764
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:12.833
Okay.

765
00:43:12.916 --> 00:43:13.750
Walk.

766
00:43:15.125 --> 00:43:18.000

you'll survive out here on your own?

[tense. atmospheric music playing]

769
00:43:58.875 --> 00:44:00.458
You were right to fire.

770
00:44:02.833 --> 00:44:04.125
It was a launcher.

771
00:44:05.625 --> 00:44:07.583
You killed two marines but saved 38.

772
00:44:07.666 --> 00:44:10.083
They should've put
a fucking medal on your chest.

773
00:44:11.166 --> 00:44:12.500
I did the right thing.

774
00:44:14.416 --> 00:44:17.541
You mean you stepped outside your box.
and they had to put you back?

775
00:44:18.291 --> 00:44:21.083
-Is that why you think you're here?
-I broke chain of command.

776
00:44:23.041 --> 00:44:24.875
What about you? What's your mandate?

777
00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:29.791
Shit. I'm no expert. but this seems
beyond protocol for a r--

778
00:44:33.125 --> 00:44:34.208
…whatever you are.

779
00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:38.208
Shake my hand.

780
00:44:47.291 --> 00:44:48.250
What do you feel?

781
00:44:50.083 --> 00:44:51.875
A hand. Soft tissue and heat--

782
00:44:51.958 --> 00:44:52.791
Heat.

783
00:44:54.708 --> 00:44:55.791
Grab my arm.

784
00:44:58.958 --> 00:44:59.958

Cold. Steel.

[Leo] Lifeless.

788
00:45:07.958 --> 00:45:09.500
I'm not a man. Lieutenant.

789
00:45:10.583 --> 00:45:12.458
I was created to simulate one

790
00:45:12.541 --> 00:45:14.791
to the exact necessity to do my damn job.

791
00:45:16.083 --> 00:45:17.375
I'm a combat soldier.

792
00:45:18.625 --> 00:45:22.458
But I also have the ability to break
the rules in certain circumstances.

793
00:45:22.541 --> 00:45:24.750
-Just like you.
-What kind of circumstances?

794
00:45:24.833 --> 00:45:28.583
In extreme situations. I have
the ability to act of my own volition.

795
00:45:30.666 --> 00:45:32.625
And is this an extreme situation?

796
00:45:32.708 --> 00:45:34.500
Ask me what you really wanna ask.

797
00:45:34.583 --> 00:45:35.916
How come you're so like us?

798
00:45:37.375 --> 00:45:38.375
Sentient?

799
00:45:38.458 --> 00:45:39.291
Emotional.

800
00:45:39.833 --> 00:45:42.083
So. you equate humanity with emotion?

801
00:45:42.166 --> 00:45:43.500
I equate it with fault.

802
00:45:44.166 --> 00:45:45.291
People are stupid.

803
00:45:45.375 --> 00:45:46.875
habitual. and lazy.

804
00:45:47.625 --> 00:45:49.750
Their emotions lead to mistakes.

805
00:45:52.083 --> 00:45:54.750
Maybe humans aren't
emotional enough. Lieutenant.

819

So formal.
You'll be calling me ma'am next.

I hear you had some trouble in Damsk.

I've done everything
you asked me to do. Sofiya.

00:48:04.541 --> 00:48:06.833
I'm gonna need you
to level with me. please.

827

Come on.

828
00:48:09.208 --> 00:48:10.541
Tell me what you know.

In front of him?

830
00:48:13.708 --> 00:48:14.833
You can trust him.

00:48:16.333 --> 00:48:18.583
-She can trust you. Right. Harp?
-Uh. yeah.

832
00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:21.000
Yeah. you can trust me.

833
00:48:26.125 --> 00:48:27.833
The violence at the hospital…

834
00:48:29.250 --> 00:48:30.833
It was definitely a Krasny spy?

835
00:48:30.916 --> 00:48:32.333
As Krasny as it gets.

836
00:48:32.416 --> 00:48:33.666
Fuck.

837
00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:37.958
I think Koval's one step away
from operating the silos.

838
00:48:38.041 --> 00:48:40.583
What? How'd you know that?

839
00:48:40.666 --> 00:48:44.750
The nuclear missiles can only be operated
by highly classified access codes.

840
00:48:47.041 --> 00:48:50.041
When the Cold War ended.
an FSK agent got hold of those codes

841
00:48:50.125 --> 00:48:51.833
and hid them in a vault.

842
00:48:51.916 --> 00:48:53.083
[loud locking echoes]

843
00:48:53.666 --> 00:48:55.625
Somewhere this side of the city.

844
00:48:55.708 --> 00:48:56.958
Why would he do that?

845
00:48:57.041 --> 00:48:59.208
The agent figured
the codes would fetch a price.

846
00:48:59.916 --> 00:49:02.166
-And Koval met that price.
-I think so.

847
00:49:03.125 --> 00:49:05.708
If he knows where the silos are.
and he gets those codes.

848
00:49:05.791 --> 00:49:07.291
he'll have access to nukes.

849
00:49:07.875 --> 00:49:08.791
[sniffs]

850
00:49:09.375 --> 00:49:11.333
-Tell me where those codes are.
-I don't know.

851
00:49:11.416 --> 00:49:13.375
If we did.
we'd have gotten to them already.

852
00:49:13.458 --> 00:49:15.041
Well. tell me who might know.

853
00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:17.500

00:49:18.333 --> 00:49:19.458
[Leo] Come on.

855
00:49:19.541 --> 00:49:20.375
[Sofiya] Well.

856
00:49:21.333 --> 00:49:24.500
to break into a vault. the Krasny
would need to buy hardware here.

857
00:49:24.583 --> 00:49:27.583
as they wouldn't be able to smuggle it
or get it through our lines.

858
00:49:27.666 --> 00:49:29.125
What? Black market?

859
00:49:29.208 --> 00:49:32.750
[Sofiya] There's only one arsehole
with access to the weapons they'd need

860
00:49:32.833 --> 00:49:34.791
who wouldn't think twice
about betraying us.

861
00:49:34.875 --> 00:49:37.250
He's an arms dealer called Varyk Oshlak.

862
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:40.166
If they went to him.
he might know where it's located.

863
00:49:42.166 --> 00:49:43.541
Can you take us to him?

864
00:49:44.791 --> 00:49:46.541
You'll need weapons of your own.

868
00:50:02.791 --> 00:50:04.708
Sadly. no discounts for the US.

869
00:50:04.791 --> 00:50:07.041
What? Hold up.
You're buying weapons from her?

870
00:50:07.125 --> 00:50:09.041
How do you think I pay for this orphanage?

871
00:50:10.291 --> 00:50:12.791
You know these are illegal weapons. right?

872
00:50:14.250 --> 00:50:16.250
You gonna arrest me. Lieutenant?

-[Sofiya] You have to do this for us.

can follow an aborted line.

If I do it. it's a fault.

might not be such a bad idea.

01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:20.166
You brought me here.

1211
01:13:21.958 --> 01:13:24.500
A drone pilot
with a history of gross disobedience.

01:13:24.583 --> 01:13:27.833
punished and humiliated.
and with nobody to believe anything I say

1213
01:13:27.916 --> 01:13:31.083
unless you back it up. so tell me
what the fuck am I doing here.

1214
01:13:31.166 --> 01:13:32.833
and what are you using me for?

1215
01:13:32.916 --> 01:13:35.291
Sounds like you don't trust me. Harp.

1216
01:13:36.416 --> 01:13:37.625
That makes me upset.

1217
01:13:40.291 --> 01:13:41.833
You weren't assigned. Harp.

1218
01:13:42.541 --> 01:13:46.875
I chose you. I needed someone
who could think outside the box.

1219
01:13:49.291 --> 01:13:52.625
Leo. I'm ordering you
to return us back to base immediately

-or be in breach of your moral directives.
-[Leo scoffs]

1221
01:13:55.708 --> 01:13:58.625
And the fact that I can act
of my own volition scares you.

1222
01:13:58.708 --> 01:14:00.375
No. you need me to validate you.

1223
01:14:00.458 --> 01:14:02.250
Oh. come on! Here we go.

1224
01:14:02.333 --> 01:14:03.833
Who validates you?

1225
01:14:03.916 --> 01:14:05.583
You follow me. I follow you.

1226
01:14:05.666 --> 01:14:08.041
It's kinda like
a paradox of command. isn't it?

01:14:08.125 --> 01:14:11.416
-I'm ordering you to stop the fucking car.
-Or what?

1228

Hmm? [laughs]

1229
01:14:15.958 --> 01:14:19.375
My backup system allows me
to relinquish the need for human authority

1230
01:14:19.458 --> 01:14:23.041
if said person is exhibiting

1231
01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:24.250
You. my friend.

1232
01:14:24.833 --> 01:14:28.291
have exercised improper.
impaired judgment throughout this mission…

1233
01:14:29.791 --> 01:14:31.625
-Do you trust me?
-Yes. sir.

1234
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:38.125
[Leo] …including the removal
of one fail-safe device.

1235
01:14:38.916 --> 01:14:41.458
A what? You told me that was your tracker.

1236
01:14:43.541 --> 01:14:46.125
You disabled US military hardware.

1237
01:14:47.125 --> 01:14:49.000
Thanks to your air strike back there…

1238
01:14:49.083 --> 01:14:50.875
Tell him Koval's in the building.

1239
01:14:50.958 --> 01:14:52.666
…Eckhart thinks I'm destroyed.

1240
01:14:54.166 --> 01:14:55.041
Gotcha.

1241
01:14:56.541 --> 01:14:58.208
[Leo] War is ugly.

1242
01:14:59.041 --> 01:15:02.000
Sometimes you gotta get dirty
to see any real change.

1243
01:15:05.125 --> 01:15:07.583
Hey. hey! Don't grow balls now.

1244
01:15:10.708 --> 01:15:11.791
Put it down.

1245
01:15:13.458 --> 01:15:14.541
There you go.

1246
01:15:17.083 --> 01:15:18.708
You owe me more than this. man.

1247
01:15:20.333 --> 01:15:21.166
Nah. kid.

1248
01:15:22.916 --> 01:15:24.750
I just saved your fucking life.

1249

[boy speaks Ukrainian]

1258
01:16:16.625 --> 01:16:17.458
Fuck!

1259

[coughing]

1263
01:17:02.375 --> 01:17:04.250
[Harp] Can't fucking breathe in here.

1264
01:17:04.833 --> 01:17:07.750
[gasps] Hello?
I can't fucking breathe in here!

1265
01:17:07.833 --> 01:17:08.791
[grunts]

1266
01:17:08.875 --> 01:17:10.500
The boss is coming! Be quiet.

1267
01:17:10.583 --> 01:17:11.666
[Harp yells]

1268
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:13.000
What the fuck is that?

1269
01:17:13.083 --> 01:17:14.708
[Sofiya] Sodium pentothal.

1270
01:17:14.791 --> 01:17:17.458
It's truth serum.
You'll tell us all we need to know.

1271
01:17:18.791 --> 01:17:19.791
[Harp] The boss?

1272
01:17:20.541 --> 01:17:22.708
[gasps]

1273
01:17:23.375 --> 01:17:24.458
Jesus Christ.

1274
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.875
-Are you the leader of the Resistance?
-Are you our enemy?

1275
01:17:28.958 --> 01:17:31.125
No. No. I'm not your fucking enemy.

1276
01:17:31.208 --> 01:17:32.916
I-I don't have any information.

1277
01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:38.083
[laughs] It wasn't pentothal.
It was antibiotic for your wounds.

1278
01:17:40.291 --> 01:17:41.291
[Harp scoffs]

1279
01:17:42.375 --> 01:17:43.375
Right. Awesome joke.

1280
01:17:43.458 --> 01:17:45.458
Hilarious. comical. very fucking funny.

1281
01:17:45.541 --> 01:17:46.875
Can you untie me now?

1282
01:17:46.958 --> 01:17:50.208
-Not until I know you're no threat.
-I'm not a threat. Leo is.

1283
01:17:50.291 --> 01:17:53.125
-I think he's going after Perimeter.
-No. he's going for Koval.

1284
01:17:53.208 --> 01:17:55.333
-Then he's going for Perimeter.
-Koval's dead.

1285
01:17:55.416 --> 01:17:57.791
-He died in the bank strike.
-He wasn't there.

1286
01:17:59.833 --> 01:18:01.458
He's still very much alive.

1287
01:18:10.291 --> 01:18:13.791
Leo's going to take control of
the nuclear missiles for the Resistance.

1288
01:18:15.166 --> 01:18:16.000
For us.

1289
01:18:19.666 --> 01:18:21.541
I told you I'd get the codes. Viktor.

1290
01:18:23.291 --> 01:18:24.291
General Koval.

1291
01:18:26.250 --> 01:18:27.958
Why would you try to kill me?

1292
01:18:34.666 --> 01:18:35.916
Oh. Leo…

1293
01:18:40.375 --> 01:18:41.666
I took insurance.

1294
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:43.708
I am your insurance.

1295
01:18:43.791 --> 01:18:44.916
[chuckles]

1296
01:18:51.625 --> 01:18:52.750
You have the codes?

1297
01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:01.916
-Give them.
-[Leo scoffs]

1298
01:19:06.208 --> 01:19:08.916
What's stopping me
from killing you and taking it?

1299
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.708
You honestly think
I would have them with me. Viktor?

1300
01:19:12.458 --> 01:19:13.541
I'm not an idiot.

1301
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.666
That would make me human.

1302
01:19:20.041 --> 01:19:21.166
[laughs]

1303
01:19:22.375 --> 01:19:23.875
That's what he told you.

1304
01:19:25.083 --> 01:19:27.416
-We trust in Leo.
-You trust in Leo?

1305
01:19:28.083 --> 01:19:31.583
He's more likely to take control
of the nukes himself. and he used you.

1306
01:19:34.083 --> 01:19:36.166
-He told you that?
-Not in so many words.

1307
01:19:36.958 --> 01:19:40.625
I don't know exactly why he's doing it.
but you can't trust him.

1308
01:19:41.333 --> 01:19:42.916
He's a machine. Sofiya.

1309
01:19:46.333 --> 01:19:47.666
What do you want?

1310
01:19:48.875 --> 01:19:51.166
I want the location of Perimeter.

1311
01:19:51.250 --> 01:19:52.291
Hmm.

1312
01:19:54.166 --> 01:19:55.666
What do I get in return?

1313
01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:00.625
I'll let you live.

1314
01:20:00.708 --> 01:20:01.958
[laughs]

1315
01:20:04.625 --> 01:20:07.083
I didn't know your kind
had such a sense of humor.

1316
01:20:11.125 --> 01:20:15.375
It's incredible
what man is able to create.

1317
01:20:17.250 --> 01:20:20.250
[Sofiya] I think I know Leo
better than you. Lieutenant Harp.

1318
01:20:20.875 --> 01:20:23.708
You see. Leo. he can't lie to himself.

1319
01:20:24.375 --> 01:20:27.541
He can't pretend
there's virtue in an immoral act.

1320
01:20:28.708 --> 01:20:30.333
That's why he's gone rogue.

1321
01:20:31.291 --> 01:20:35.041
-He's learned who the real enemy is.
-The real enemy. Who? The US military?

1322
01:20:35.125 --> 01:20:38.041
They rationalize this war
because it serves their fucking agenda.

1323
01:20:38.125 --> 01:20:39.833
This is a peacekeeping mission.

1324
01:20:39.916 --> 01:20:40.875
[scoffs] "Peace."

1325
01:20:40.958 --> 01:20:43.500
Russia wants its former territories back.

1326
01:20:43.583 --> 01:20:48.083
The US wants to destabilize Russia
by extending conflict in those countries.

1327
01:20:48.166 --> 01:20:51.125
We are the ones
who want fucking peace. Lieutenant Harp.

1328
01:20:51.708 --> 01:20:54.500
And if Leo's rogue operation
makes sure you leave us in peace.

1329
01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:58.416
if your war machine turns against you.
well then. why should I fucking care?

1330
01:20:59.250 --> 01:21:01.125
[Leo] A crazy terrorist with nukes.

1331
01:21:02.708 --> 01:21:04.750
Downtown Washington. New York…

1332
01:21:06.458 --> 01:21:08.333
[screaming]

1333
01:21:08.416 --> 01:21:09.625
Who knows?

1334
01:21:13.666 --> 01:21:16.333
He's gonna launch
a nuclear strike on the US.

1335
01:21:19.541 --> 01:21:20.500
[sniffs]

1336
01:21:21.083 --> 01:21:23.125
Innocent people will die.

1337
01:21:27.541 --> 01:21:29.208
Aren't they just collateral?

1338
01:21:32.125 --> 01:21:33.750
Or not when it's American lives.

1339
01:21:33.833 --> 01:21:37.083
It's not collateral. It's mass murder.
You can't let him do this.

1340
01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:42.875
What will you do with so much power?

1341
01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.833
That's between me and my creator.

1342
01:21:46.916 --> 01:21:48.125
Philosophical.

1343
01:21:48.208 --> 01:21:49.125
Mm-hmm.

1344
01:21:49.625 --> 01:21:51.625
What would you do with it. Viktor?

1345
01:21:53.625 --> 01:21:55.541
I will guarantee world peace.

1346
01:21:57.041 --> 01:21:58.375
[both laugh]

1347
01:21:59.958 --> 01:22:03.041
-I knew you would say that.
-Well. yeah. Can you say the same?

1348
01:22:03.125 --> 01:22:04.208
We'll see.

1349
01:22:08.333 --> 01:22:09.875
Now we have a deal.

1350
01:22:12.333 --> 01:22:14.291
I take Perimeter.

1351
01:22:15.333 --> 01:22:17.083
Then I dictate.

1352
01:22:19.708 --> 01:22:21.875
-Let's forget what happened.
-[Leo scoffs]

1353
01:22:21.958 --> 01:22:24.125
We can be good allies
in the worst to come.

1354
01:22:24.208 --> 01:22:25.625
[they chuckle]

1355
01:22:26.458 --> 01:22:29.833
Don't make me have to ruin
this marvel of American technology.

1356
01:22:29.916 --> 01:22:31.041

1359
01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.458
My man.

1360
01:22:38.541 --> 01:22:42.541
what makes you think
that you're still calling shots?

1361
01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:46.583
You should have never tried to kill me.

1362
01:22:57.625 --> 01:22:58.625
[laughs]

1363
01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:01.958

How many people will die?

1378
01:24:20.791 --> 01:24:22.875
How many people will die. Sofiya?

[sniffs]

1380
01:24:28.958 --> 01:24:30.250
Can't answer it. can you?

[computer beeps]

1384
01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:46.916
[Sofiya] Enough to teach Americans
about collateral damage.

1385
01:24:55.958 --> 01:24:57.083
You're on your own.

1386
01:24:59.125 --> 01:25:00.000
What?

1387
01:25:00.708 --> 01:25:02.291
Go home. It's over.

1388
01:25:05.791 --> 01:25:07.333
Spasiba. Viktor.

1389

[plaintive music plays]

1390
01:25:50.375 --> 01:25:51.208
[man] Halt!

1391
01:25:56.041 --> 01:25:57.250
Stay where you are!

1392
01:26:00.166 --> 01:26:01.833
I said. stay where you are!

1393
01:26:02.625 --> 01:26:03.750
Down on the ground!

1394
01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.375
Dismissed. At ease.

1395
01:26:25.583 --> 01:26:26.750
What the hell's going on?

1396
01:26:28.333 --> 01:26:30.708
Sergeant Miller has been briefed
on Operation Leo. Go ahead.

1397
01:26:32.875 --> 01:26:34.375
Leo's alive. sir.

1398
01:26:35.541 --> 01:26:37.208
-He's gone AWOL.
-[Eckhart sighs]

1399
01:26:38.833 --> 01:26:39.666
Right.

1400
01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:43.041
I appreciate
that you had a rough time out there.

1401
01:26:43.125 --> 01:26:46.375
Captain Leo was destroyed.
We lost his signal immediately.

1402
01:26:46.458 --> 01:26:49.125
He lost his signal
'cause I removed his fail-safe.

1403
01:26:50.291 --> 01:26:51.125
You did what?

1404
01:26:51.208 --> 01:26:54.291
I know I fucked up. okay?
But. sir. you've gotta listen to me.

1405
01:26:54.375 --> 01:26:56.833
Leo has the codes.
and he's going after the silos.

1406
01:26:56.916 --> 01:26:58.208
He's on his way to Koval.

1407
01:26:58.291 --> 01:26:59.875
You said Koval was at the bank.

1408
01:26:59.958 --> 01:27:02.458
-He's dead.
-Leo tricked me. Koval was never there.

1409
01:27:02.541 --> 01:27:06.000
Wanted me to call in the drone strike
so it would appear he'd been destroyed.

1410
01:27:06.083 --> 01:27:08.833
You could've turned back.
he would've been forced to comply.

1411
01:27:08.916 --> 01:27:13.000
Leo's smarter than we are. He's stronger.
faster. and he can be very persuasive.

1412
01:27:13.083 --> 01:27:16.166
This Viktor Koval Perimeter stuff.
it's all bullshit!

1413
01:27:16.750 --> 01:27:18.916
Anything to it.
Intel would've made it priority.

1414
01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.250
-I am the fucking Intel!
-Sit down!

1415
01:27:26.875 --> 01:27:28.166
I saw the heist. sir.

1416
01:27:29.333 --> 01:27:30.583
I was eyes on the ground.

1417
01:27:32.166 --> 01:27:33.291
Perimeter's real. sir.

1418
01:27:34.458 --> 01:27:36.833
-And Leo's going after it.
-I thought Koval was.

1419
01:27:36.916 --> 01:27:40.083
Leo's playing the Krasnys
and the Resistance against each other.

1420
01:27:41.041 --> 01:27:43.041
They all have the same goal.

1421
01:27:43.125 --> 01:27:44.583
Nuke the US mainland.

1422
01:27:48.041 --> 01:27:49.958
-But Leo is calling the shots.

1423
01:27:50.041 --> 01:27:51.333
Impossible. He can't--

1424
01:27:51.416 --> 01:27:55.291
He can! He put a gun to my head and said
something about a paradox of command.

1425
01:27:56.625 --> 01:27:59.041
Me using my judgment
triggered his fail-safe directive

1426
01:27:59.125 --> 01:28:02.375
to relinquish his need
to follow human authority.

1427
01:28:08.541 --> 01:28:09.791

1429
01:28:14.875 --> 01:28:17.875
-How do you know he's gonna meet Koval?
-It's a long fucking story.

1430
01:28:17.958 --> 01:28:19.958
Sir. we don't have time for this. okay?

1431
01:28:20.041 --> 01:28:21.708
-We've gotta find him fast.
-How?

1432
01:28:21.791 --> 01:28:24.291
Hmm? You made that practically impossible.
Lieutenant.

1433
01:28:24.875 --> 01:28:26.000
How's he getting around?

1434
01:28:28.083 --> 01:28:29.125
Oshlak's car.

1435
01:28:30.750 --> 01:28:32.458
Who the fuck is Oshlak?

1436
01:28:32.541 --> 01:28:35.166
Arms dealer.
We've been tracking him for months.

1437
01:28:38.458 --> 01:28:40.666
It'll take us hours to go through Central.

1438
01:28:41.250 --> 01:28:42.458
Do you have a phone?

1439
01:28:43.166 --> 01:28:44.041

1440
01:28:44.125 --> 01:28:45.916

1441

-I need your help fast.

-I'll explain later

1443
01:28:50.791 --> 01:28:52.083

1444
01:28:54.041 --> 01:28:54.916

-Okay.
-Help me.

01:28:59.375 --> 01:29:00.208
Okay.

1448
01:29:00.916 --> 01:29:04.625
Okay. Do we have any surveillance drones
out in the Snovski District

1449
01:29:04.708 --> 01:29:06.083
along the Russian border?

1450
01:29:06.166 --> 01:29:07.083

Is this what you're looking for?

1457
01:29:39.958 --> 01:29:42.666
Yes. that's him. Okay. okay. Stay on him.

1458
01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:43.666
Copy that.

1459
01:29:43.750 --> 01:29:45.041

[intense. dramatic music plays]

1461

[Eckhart] He's in disputed territory
on the Russian border.

1462
01:29:58.916 --> 01:30:02.666
I can't send forces over unverified intel.
I will start a war with the Russians.

1463
01:30:02.750 --> 01:30:04.166
You don't have to. sir.

1464
01:30:05.666 --> 01:30:06.500
I'll go.

1465
01:30:06.583 --> 01:30:08.208
Harp. you said it yourself.

1466
01:30:08.708 --> 01:30:10.625
He's stronger. faster. smarter.

1467
01:30:10.708 --> 01:30:13.625
-Once I find him. I'll call it in.
-And then what?

1468
01:30:15.875 --> 01:30:19.208
Can we drone strike the silos
without detonating the warheads?

1469
01:30:20.291 --> 01:30:22.875
It'll take out the command center
and disarm the missiles.

1470
01:30:22.958 --> 01:30:24.291
What if you don't get to him?

1471
01:30:24.375 --> 01:30:28.125
Then deny we had this conversation
and pray I'm wrong about his plans.

1472
