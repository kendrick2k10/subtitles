[audience cheering. applauding]

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:48.339
[announcer] Welcome to the stage.

00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:53.845
the one. the only: Ronny Chieng!

[cheering continues]

9
00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:08.068
Yes! Yes!

10
00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:10.028
Yes!

11
00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:12.781
We did it. We did it.

12
00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:16.785
-We solved racism. Thank you.
-[laughter]

13
00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:18.328
Thank you for coming out.

14
00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:21.039
Thank you for coming tonight.
New York City.

15
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.377
Thank you for not dying
during the pandemic.

16
00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:29.422
Thank you for surviving.

17
00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:33.051
We couldn't do comedy without you.

18
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.053
We tried.

19
00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.264
There's too many fucking podcasts.

20
00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:42.811
I feel like 2021 was the year

21
00:01:42.894 --> 00:01:46.523
that people who peaked in high school
really found their voice…

22
00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:48.024
[laughter]

23
00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:50.318
…on the Internet.

24
00:01:51.694 --> 00:01:55.573
All these fucking idiots on Facebook
demanding evidence.

25
00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:59.661
You're trying to give them
life-saving information.

26
00:01:59.744 --> 00:02:02.789
Like. "Here's some
life-saving information."

27
00:02:02.872 --> 00:02:06.459
"Where's the evidence for this?
Where's the evidence for this?

28
00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:07.585
Where's the evidence?"

29
00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:10.672
All these fucking D-average students

30
00:02:11.923 --> 00:02:15.677
who lack
basic reading comprehension skills

31
00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:20.306
demanding PhD-level evidence

32
00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:23.143
on virology.

33
00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:27.814
What could you ever show them
that would be enough?

34
00:02:27.897 --> 00:02:32.944
What evidence could you possibly show them
where they'd be like…

35
00:02:34.612 --> 00:02:35.905
"Oh. my God. Thank you so much…

36
00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:40.994
for showing me this evidence.

37
00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:45.123
I wasn't aware
of this scientific theory before.

38
00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:50.128
but now that I've read every page
of this peer-reviewed article.

39
00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:53.548
including the footnotes.

40
00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:58.094
and I spent the weekend cross-referencing
the sources on LexisNexis.

41
00:02:58.177 --> 00:03:00.054
and everything seems to check out.

42
00:03:00.138 --> 00:03:02.891
and I feel like
I'm a better person for it.

43
00:03:02.974 --> 00:03:08.479
So. thank you so much for taking the time
to make me a better person."

44
00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:10.356
These fucking morons.

45
00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:13.776
They're fucking morons. They are.

46
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.574
I appreciate the sentiment
of wanting to understand everything

47
00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:22.035
and having critical-thinking skills.

48
00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:27.832
But the amount of background knowledge
you need to know to get to this point.

49
00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:33.087
it's a little late in the game
to be getting into the "knowing" business.

50
00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:38.676
At this stage of your life. you're more
in the "shut up and listen" business

51
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.969
because there's too much.

52
00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:42.013
There's too much shit you missed out on.

53
00:03:42.096 --> 00:03:44.349
You skipped too many classes. all right?

54
00:03:44.432 --> 00:03:46.976
You're like the guy
who didn't study all semester.

55
00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.229
and then you show up for the exam.

56
00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:52.106
and you're like.
"None of this makes sense!

57
00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:54.609
Math isn't real!"

58
00:03:56.361 --> 00:04:00.615
There's too much-- It's like trying
to explain quantum physics to a dog.

59
00:04:00.698 --> 00:04:04.994
It's just beyond you at this point.
Just get with the program. All right?

60
00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:09.165
This is the miraculous technological era
that we live in right now.

61
00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:14.504
Okay. within three months
of this shit breaking out in March 2020.

62
00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:18.091
they decoded the genome of the virus.

63
00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:20.093
Yeah. they decoded it.

64
00:04:21.177 --> 00:04:24.305
They were like.
"Yo. everyone. look. we found it.

65
00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.266
We found the enemy.

66
00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.434
Everybody. look. we got it right here.

67
00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:32.230
Look. it's A-A-A-A. B-B-B-B-B-B.
G-G-G-G-G-G.

68
00:04:32.313 --> 00:04:35.233
-A-A-A-A. D-D-D-D-D. A-A-A. C-C-C-C-C. T."
-[laughter]

69
00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:41.656
Can you imagine showing that
to these idiots on Facebook…

70
00:04:43.866 --> 00:04:45.785
demanding evidence?

71
00:04:45.868 --> 00:04:48.663
Saying. "Where's the evidence?
Where's the evidence?"

72
00:04:48.746 --> 00:04:50.665
Like. "Right here. We got it.

73
00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:55.670
We found the exact sequence
of proteins and amino acids."

74
00:04:57.922 --> 00:04:59.257
"What the fuck is this shit?

75
00:05:01.175 --> 00:05:04.095
Oh. yeah. right. You 'decoded' a genome.

76
00:05:04.178 --> 00:05:07.765
Oh. yeah. you expect us to believe
you 'decoded' a genome.

77
00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:10.977
and that's what it looks like.
these shitty Scrabble letters.

78
00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:15.356
Yeah. I can decode genomes too.
Anyone can decode genomes.

79
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.067
Watch me decode genomes
on my keyboard all day."

80
00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:19.777
[laughter]

81
00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:23.156
All these fucking D-average students

82
00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:27.076
who were in the back of the classroom
their entire academic career.

83
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.911
They were in the back of the class.

84
00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:30.830
Stay the fuck in the back.

85
00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:35.918
Don't come to the front during a pandemic

86
00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:39.881
because you figured out
how to start a podcast.

87
00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:45.178
Stay the fuck in the back with
your D-average mouth where you belong.

88
00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:49.640
You had every opportunity
to prove yourself academically

89
00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:54.145
and you failed or were mediocre at best
at every level.

90
00:05:54.228 --> 00:05:57.607
Why the fuck should we listen to you
about anything?

91
00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.942
Let the nerds lead.

92
00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:01.819
Yeah. Yeah.

93
00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:08.451
Yeah. That's what the nerds are for.

94
00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:13.539
Everything around you
was built by fucking nerds.

95
00:06:14.707 --> 00:06:17.168
That's their job.

96
00:06:17.251 --> 00:06:22.340
Nerds are here to input as much
raw data into their head as possible.

97
00:06:22.423 --> 00:06:24.258
swirl it around.

98
00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:28.721
and then regurgitate a path forward
of highest probability of success.

99
00:06:29.722 --> 00:06:33.851
All right? And. yeah. some stuff fucks up
because it's a probability thing.

100
00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:35.937
All right?
It's a normal distribution curve.

101
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.939
You're never gonna get
a standard deviation of zero.

102
00:06:38.022 --> 00:06:39.398
That's basic central limit theorem.

103
00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:40.525
-right?
-[laughter]

104
00:06:42.276 --> 00:06:45.404
Like. I love these guys
who didn't go to school

105
00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:48.407
and they automatically assume
that they're street smart.

106
00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:52.328
It's like. "Yo. it's not automatic.

107
00:06:52.411 --> 00:06:53.955
[laughter]

108
00:06:54.038 --> 00:06:56.707
You could be both dumb and street dumb.

109
00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:02.004
That's also a possibility."

110
00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:08.094
I've been lucky to live
in a couple of countries in my life.

111
00:07:08.177 --> 00:07:11.097
I was born and raised in Malaysia.

112
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.852
I grew up in Singapore.
I lived in Australia for. like. ten years.

113
00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:17.979
and now I live in America.

114
00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:20.314
Feel free to cheer that last one.

115
00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:21.649
[laughter]

116
00:07:21.732 --> 00:07:23.526
Or not. it's fine.

117
00:07:23.609 --> 00:07:26.988
-[person] Yeah! Whoo!
-It's a bit late. You missed it.

118
00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:30.408
But I applaud you for trying. [chuckles]

119
00:07:30.491 --> 00:07:32.368
[laughter]

120
00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:35.830
Um. I'm just saying
I've lived a few places. okay?

121
00:07:35.913 --> 00:07:37.707
Not just for like a weekend getaway.

122
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.877
I've lived in these places
for like a decade or more. Okay?

123
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:45.214
And I'm telling you guys
from personal experience. all right.

124
00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:48.092
there's racist people everywhere.

125
00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:53.139
Okay? Every country
has its racist. awful people.

126
00:07:53.222 --> 00:07:55.683
I've seen them. They fucking suck.

127
00:07:56.684 --> 00:08:00.229
Also. it's such an obvious point to make.
I thought it goes without saying.

128
00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:02.607
But apparently.
if you don't say it enough in America.

129
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.026
everyone goes crazy with the whataboutism.

130
00:08:05.109 --> 00:08:07.653
You're trying to point out
some fucked-up situations.

131
00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:09.989
like. "Yo. this situation is fucked up."

132
00:08:10.072 --> 00:08:13.951
And some people are like. "You think
that's fucked up? What about these people?

133
00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:17.955
And what about what these jerks are doing?
What about what these assholes are doing?"

134
00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:19.624
And it's like. "Yeah. of course.

135
00:08:19.707 --> 00:08:24.295
Of course. every race
has its racist. awful people."

136
00:08:25.463 --> 00:08:31.677
The problem is we keep comparing
the worst 10% of one race

137
00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:35.848
with the best 10% of another race.

138
00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:37.183
[laughter]

139
00:08:37.266 --> 00:08:39.435
Right? Which is obviously a mistake.

140
00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:42.855
Because what we should be doing

141
00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:46.400
is we should be getting
the worst 10% of every race

142
00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:50.571
and comparing that.

143
00:08:52.406 --> 00:08:55.535
So we can figure out
which is the worst race.

144
00:09:00.748 --> 00:09:05.670
So we can finally answer that question
and solve racism.

145
00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:08.756
Because then there can be consensus.

146
00:09:10.007 --> 00:09:14.220
Right? We can be like.
"Yo. look. This race is the worst."

147
00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:20.101
And that race can take a good look around
and be like. "Yeah. we are the worst.

148
00:09:22.687 --> 00:09:23.980
Goddamn it."

149
00:09:25.022 --> 00:09:26.607
And then there can be healing.

150
00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:31.237
Right? But we gotta be
comparing apples to apples.

151
00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:35.074
We can't be going high-low
with the comparisons.

152
00:09:35.157 --> 00:09:36.993
The p-values are too high.

153
00:09:37.076 --> 00:09:39.078
[laughter]

154
00:09:39.161 --> 00:09:41.455
In fact. you know what?
Fuck it. let's do it right now.

155
00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:42.790
Yeah. let's do it right now.

156
00:09:42.873 --> 00:09:45.209
Let's figure out
which is the worst race right now.

157
00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:46.669
Okay? You guys up for it?

158
00:09:46.752 --> 00:09:48.671
-[audience] Yeah!
-All right. Okay. Cool.

159
00:09:48.754 --> 00:09:52.300
On three. I want you to shout out
which race you think is the worst.

160
00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:54.677
All right? Okay? No. no. no.

161
00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.555
Don't worry. We'll all do it together.
We'll all do it together.

162
00:09:57.638 --> 00:10:00.099
I'll join in. Of course. I'll join in.

163
00:10:00.891 --> 00:10:04.020
Right? Don't worry. this is a comedy show.
This is a safe space.

164
00:10:04.103 --> 00:10:05.104
[laughter]

165
00:10:05.187 --> 00:10:08.149
We asked you to put your phones away
for this moment right now.

166
00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:10.318
Now is the time to let it out.

167
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.155
This is it. Don't-- Don't bottle it up
and go crazy outside.

168
00:10:14.238 --> 00:10:18.117
Just-- Let it out now.
Let the demons out now. all right? Okay?

169
00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:21.954
You don't even have to be specific.
Okay? Just shout a color.

170
00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:23.414
[laughter]

171
00:10:23.497 --> 00:10:25.041
Okay? Okay?

172
00:10:25.124 --> 00:10:26.959
Guys. we all know
what the answer is going to be.

173
00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:27.877
[laughter]

174
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.004
Come on.
Who are we fooling here? All right?

175
00:10:30.087 --> 00:10:33.507
Okay. on three. worst race on three.
Okay? One…

176
00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:35.885
This is happening.

177
00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:38.220
whether you join in or not.

178
00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:40.348
You might as well say something.

179
00:10:40.431 --> 00:10:42.058
even if you don't believe it.

180
00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:44.310
Just as a creative exercise.
Just let it out.

181
00:10:44.393 --> 00:10:46.729
It's like speaking in tongues.
Just go… [babbles]

182
00:10:46.812 --> 00:10:48.272
All right? Okay. on three. Okay?

183
00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:50.691
Worst race. on three. all right?

184
00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:54.153
Okay. one. Worst race. Two.

185
00:10:55.112 --> 00:10:56.572
-Three.
-[person shouts indistinctly]

186
00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:59.825
If you said anything.
you're the worst 10% of your race.

187
00:11:03.454 --> 00:11:05.873
That was fucking disgusting.

188
00:11:05.956 --> 00:11:08.042
[laughter]

189
00:11:08.125 --> 00:11:13.506
Bunch of goddamn racists
coming to my show in New York City.

190
00:11:14.715 --> 00:11:17.134
completely missing the point of that joke.

191
00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:18.511
[laughter]

192
00:11:18.594 --> 00:11:20.763
And I'm going to expose you
to the country.

193
00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:23.974
every comedy show I do.

194
00:11:24.058 --> 00:11:26.060
And the problem with that joke is

195
00:11:26.143 --> 00:11:31.857
I can't get in there any quicker
to interrupt you fucking barbarians

196
00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:38.072
before you shout some shit out that's
gonna start a race riot in New York City.

197
00:11:38.739 --> 00:11:41.784
But you know what?
Fuck it. I need the publicity.

198
00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:43.411
[laughter]

199
00:11:43.494 --> 00:11:46.122
I need the press. Do it.

200
00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:48.833
Do it. Start a race riot.

201
00:11:50.334 --> 00:11:53.629
In this room. do it right now
and blame me.

202
00:11:53.712 --> 00:11:55.172
Blame me. tag me.

203
00:11:56.173 --> 00:11:57.675
Tag me in the fight video.

204
00:11:58.884 --> 00:12:00.553
Blame me. Cancel me.

205
00:12:02.096 --> 00:12:03.264
Cancel me.

206
00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.809
Tell Twitter I told you to say the N-word.

207
00:12:06.892 --> 00:12:07.893
[laughter]

208
00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:09.311
Do it. Cancel me.

209
00:12:10.062 --> 00:12:11.147
Cancel me.

210
00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:17.445
If you really think
you have the ability to cancel me.

211
00:12:17.528 --> 00:12:21.657
sitting in your underwear at home
on your fucking phone. do it.

212
00:12:22.616 --> 00:12:25.536
Cancel me. Cancel me.

213
00:12:25.619 --> 00:12:29.206
I left three countries
with free health care and no guns.

214
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:30.666
[laughter]

215
00:12:30.749 --> 00:12:31.834
[person] Whoo!

216
00:12:34.837 --> 00:12:38.883
I moved to America in 2015
already prepared to die.

217
00:12:38.966 --> 00:12:40.509
[laughter]

218
00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:48.184
You think with MAGA idiots. Asian hate.
uncontrolled COVID.

219
00:12:48.267 --> 00:12:51.187
Twitter people scare me?

220
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.856
Do it. Cancel me. Cancel me.

221
00:12:53.939 --> 00:12:58.110
What are you gonna do? Cancel me
so I have to go back to Malaysia

222
00:12:58.194 --> 00:13:00.905
where I'm a national hero?

223
00:13:03.824 --> 00:13:07.786
And the currency advantage
is very much in my favor?

224
00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:12.875
[imitates crying]
Oh. no! How will I ever survive?

225
00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.585
[normal] Do it. Do it.

226
00:13:15.377 --> 00:13:17.254
Free me from this hell.

227
00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:20.758
Do it. My mom lives
in Singapore right now.

228
00:13:20.841 --> 00:13:22.593
I haven't seen my mom in two years.

229
00:13:22.676 --> 00:13:24.428
Cancel me so I can see my mom.

230
00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:25.513
[laughter]

231
00:13:25.596 --> 00:13:29.058
I keep getting acting jobs.
Cancel me so I can see my mom.

232
00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:32.269
Everyone thinks that
because I'm on The Daily Show.

233
00:13:32.353 --> 00:13:34.021
I'm here to save the world.

234
00:13:34.104 --> 00:13:36.398
No. I'm not here to save the world. man.

235
00:13:36.482 --> 00:13:40.611
I'm here to talk shit.
make money and bounce! That is it.

236
00:13:41.195 --> 00:13:44.156
-That is it. Yes.
-[cheering. clapping]

237
00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:49.703
Everyone's always asking me
to use my platform.

238
00:13:49.787 --> 00:13:51.872
"Ronny. use your platform.

239
00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:56.043
Okay? You have a platform.
use your platform.

240
00:13:58.379 --> 00:14:03.342
Use your platform. Ronny.
You have a platform. Use it.

241
00:14:03.425 --> 00:14:07.846
Use your platform
to talk about Asian hate. Use it."

242
00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:13.102
This is not the skill set
to talk about Asian hate. all right?

243
00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:17.523
If you can come up with a way to make
hate crimes against Asian people funny.

244
00:14:17.606 --> 00:14:20.359
be my guest. go make a joke about it.

245
00:14:20.442 --> 00:14:23.946
End your special with it.
Make it your closer.

246
00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:25.865
Everyone's always asking me
to use my platform.

247
00:14:25.948 --> 00:14:29.577
"Ronny. use your platform
to spread awareness.

248
00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:34.123
Spread it. spread awareness of vaccines.

249
00:14:34.206 --> 00:14:39.587
Ronny. if you don't use your platform
to spread awareness of vaccines.

250
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:45.009
do you know anti-vaxxers
might not take the vaccine

251
00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:48.637
and they could die?" [imitates crying]

252
00:14:49.805 --> 00:14:51.640
[normal] What am I missing?

253
00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:54.184
[laughter]

254
00:14:54.268 --> 00:14:57.730
You're telling me
if I do absolutely nothing.

255
00:14:57.813 --> 00:14:59.857
I can make humanity better

256
00:15:01.191 --> 00:15:03.402
in one to two generations?

257
00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:10.784
I mean. the public-utility-to-effort ratio
on that graph is just out of control.

258
00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:13.746
If you calculate efficiency
on that curve. at this point.

259
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:17.541
it will be socially irresponsible for me
to tell people about vaccines.

260
00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:18.876
[laughter]

261
00:15:18.959 --> 00:15:21.045
All right? Just mathematically speaking.

262
00:15:23.088 --> 00:15:27.051
Can you imagine? This is the first time
in American history.

263
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:32.264
It used to be a no-brainer
to come to America.

264
00:15:32.348 --> 00:15:35.684
That's the level of prestige
America held internationally.

265
00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:37.895
It was a dream to come to America.

266
00:15:37.978 --> 00:15:40.898
Whatever region of the world
you were from--

267
00:15:40.981 --> 00:15:45.861
Asian countries. African countries.
white people countries--

268
00:15:47.237 --> 00:15:49.823
whatever your social economic status was.

269
00:15:49.907 --> 00:15:52.952
You could be a rich white Australian.

270
00:15:53.035 --> 00:15:57.665
You hit the jackpot.
and if someone gave you a US green card.

271
00:15:57.748 --> 00:15:59.291
you'd take it in a heartbeat.

272
00:15:59.375 --> 00:16:01.251
Even then. you'd still go.

273
00:16:01.335 --> 00:16:04.838
Why wouldn't you go?
Why wouldn't you go to America?

274
00:16:04.922 --> 00:16:06.465
Why wouldn't you go?

275
00:16:06.548 --> 00:16:08.425
Of course you'd go. Why wouldn't you go?

276
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:12.096
And for the first time
in American history. the question is:

277
00:16:12.179 --> 00:16:13.764
Why would you go?

278
00:16:13.847 --> 00:16:14.848
[laughter]

279
00:16:14.932 --> 00:16:16.350
Why would you go?

280
00:16:16.433 --> 00:16:17.726
My mom in Singapore.

281
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:20.854
literally begging me
not to come back to America

282
00:16:20.938 --> 00:16:22.648
at the peak of the pandemic.

283
00:16:22.731 --> 00:16:25.109
She's like.
"Don't go. Ronny. don't go back.

284
00:16:25.192 --> 00:16:27.361
Don't go back to America. please.

285
00:16:27.444 --> 00:16:29.196
What are you going back there for?

286
00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:31.031
Half the country has lost its mind.

287
00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:34.368
the virus is raging out of control.

288
00:16:34.451 --> 00:16:38.706
major metropolitan areas
are literally on fire.

289
00:16:38.789 --> 00:16:42.710
What are you going back there for?
Why? Why?"

290
00:16:43.752 --> 00:16:47.589
And I had to tell my mom.
"Mom. you don't understand.

291
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:53.262
All right?
You don't see what I see when I'm here.

292
00:16:53.345 --> 00:16:57.307
the highest ideals of this country.

293
00:16:57.391 --> 00:17:01.687
that America. despite all its flaws.

294
00:17:03.313 --> 00:17:05.607
this is still the country

295
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.611
where you can tell dick jokes
for $12 in New York City.

296
00:17:09.695 --> 00:17:10.946
Do you understand?"

297
00:17:12.614 --> 00:17:16.076
This skill set is worthless in Singapore.

298
00:17:19.121 --> 00:17:21.290
In Singapore. I told dick jokes all day.

299
00:17:21.915 --> 00:17:24.251
Nothing ever happened.

300
00:17:24.334 --> 00:17:25.753
[laughter]

301
00:17:25.836 --> 00:17:30.049
Here. we get in Marvel movies.

302
00:17:30.132 --> 00:17:32.134
[cheering]

303
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:38.140
Did you hear me? I said Marvel movie!

304
00:17:38.223 --> 00:17:42.644
Yes! Yes! Yes!

305
00:17:43.562 --> 00:17:46.231
The chaos is worth it!

306
00:17:48.358 --> 00:17:50.486
Yeah. my mom lives in Singapore right now.

307
00:17:52.154 --> 00:17:55.407
It's very hard to explain
Singapore to Americans.

308
00:17:56.075 --> 00:17:59.787
It's very hard to explain
any other country to Americans.

309
00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:00.871
[laughter]

310
00:18:00.954 --> 00:18:03.832
Because Americans
have no point of reference

311
00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:05.918
for anywhere else on the planet. right?

312
00:18:06.001 --> 00:18:07.086
And fair enough too.

313
00:18:07.169 --> 00:18:12.257
because the only reason we knew
anything about America in Singapore

314
00:18:12.341 --> 00:18:15.761
is because we grew up watching
a lot of American TV shows.

315
00:18:15.844 --> 00:18:20.599
and that's how we formed a rough idea
of the cultural tapestry of the country.

316
00:18:20.682 --> 00:18:23.185
albeit on a very shallow level.

317
00:18:23.268 --> 00:18:24.436
But at least we understood--

318
00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:28.315
Like. watching Seinfeld. we knew.
"Oh. Seinfeld is in New York.

319
00:18:28.941 --> 00:18:30.984
There's Jewish people in New York.

320
00:18:33.362 --> 00:18:36.031
There's stand-up comedy in New York.

321
00:18:36.115 --> 00:18:38.450
What a thing to aspire to.
That's crazy. What is that?

322
00:18:38.534 --> 00:18:41.161
You can just talk into a microphone
and people pay you money?

323
00:18:41.245 --> 00:18:43.038
That's a job in America."

324
00:18:44.206 --> 00:18:47.501
We knew Grey's Anatomy was in Seattle.

325
00:18:48.877 --> 00:18:51.630
Lots of people
fucking in hospitals in Seattle.

326
00:18:52.673 --> 00:18:53.841
[person] Yeah!

327
00:18:53.924 --> 00:18:56.969
Yeah. maybe that's why
American health care is so bad.

328
00:18:59.138 --> 00:19:02.474
'Cause people
won't stop fucking in hospitals.

329
00:19:03.225 --> 00:19:06.270
We knew RoboCop was in Detroit.

330
00:19:07.312 --> 00:19:10.149
There's some problems in Detroit.

331
00:19:10.232 --> 00:19:11.608
[laughter]

332
00:19:11.692 --> 00:19:13.652
But nobody's watching Singapore TV. right?

333
00:19:13.735 --> 00:19:16.655
So no one knows what the fuck is happening
outside of America.

334
00:19:16.738 --> 00:19:19.491
'cause you don't watch
anyone else's shows.

335
00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:24.121
So. whenever I bring up
another country to my American friends.

336
00:19:24.204 --> 00:19:29.376
my American friends will always bring up
the one fact they read one time

337
00:19:29.459 --> 00:19:31.712
on the back of a Snapple cap.

338
00:19:31.795 --> 00:19:33.589
and they'll just throw it back at you

339
00:19:33.672 --> 00:19:37.634
and they try to use it to paint
the entire history of your civilization

340
00:19:37.718 --> 00:19:42.639
with whatever half-remembered.
back-of-the-brain-stem. regurgitated fact.

341
00:19:42.723 --> 00:19:46.727
They can just flick it from this part
to this part as quickly as possible.

342
00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:49.229
[babbles] Just spit it out.

343
00:19:49.313 --> 00:19:52.441
When I tell my American friends
I grew up in Singapore.

344
00:19:52.524 --> 00:19:57.404
they're always like.
"Singapore? You grew up in Singapore?

345
00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:01.158
They cane people in Singapore. right?

346
00:20:01.241 --> 00:20:04.077
Like. in Singapore.
if you spit gum on the floor.

347
00:20:04.161 --> 00:20:06.288
someone just runs up
immediately behind you

348
00:20:06.371 --> 00:20:11.043
and just canes you in your ass. Right?"

349
00:20:11.585 --> 00:20:12.961
And I'm like…

350
00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:15.881
-"Yeah.
-[laughter]

351
00:20:19.176 --> 00:20:23.055
So. don't fucking do that shit.

352
00:20:25.557 --> 00:20:28.185
What is it.
some kind of innate need of yours

353
00:20:28.268 --> 00:20:32.606
to visit other peoples' countries
and spit gum on the floor?

354
00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:37.110
In which case.
please do not visit Singapore

355
00:20:37.194 --> 00:20:41.240
because they will cane you
on your fucking face."

356
00:20:42.616 --> 00:20:45.118
And some Americans are outraged by that.

357
00:20:45.827 --> 00:20:50.415
The thought of grown men
being caned on the ass

358
00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:52.125
for being a dick.

359
00:20:53.585 --> 00:20:55.545
it's outrageous to them.

360
00:20:55.629 --> 00:20:59.174
But what's funny is. you ask any American.
especially any New Yorker.

361
00:20:59.258 --> 00:21:04.179
what they would do
if a guest came into their home

362
00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:06.348
and spit gum on the floor.

363
00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:10.477
They would be like.
"We would beat the fuck out of them."

364
00:21:11.853 --> 00:21:14.523
I'm like.
"Yeah. that's what we do in Singapore.

365
00:21:16.191 --> 00:21:19.444
We just outsourced the ass-kicking
to the government.

366
00:21:20.737 --> 00:21:24.199
It becomes a more cost-efficient
punishment for everyone involved.

367
00:21:24.783 --> 00:21:26.368
It's why we pay our taxes."

368
00:21:30.122 --> 00:21:31.748
Uh. yeah.

369
00:21:33.041 --> 00:21:35.877
I don't think women get enough credit
for taking the pill.

370
00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:38.505
-[audience] Yeah!
-They don't. man.

371
00:21:38.588 --> 00:21:41.591
Thank you. women. for taking the pill.

372
00:21:42.384 --> 00:21:45.887
Even now. half the room is like.
"What the fuck are you talking about?"

373
00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:49.016
Thank you for taking the pill.
No one ever gives you credit for it.

374
00:21:49.099 --> 00:21:53.020
Men barely appreciate the expense.

375
00:21:53.103 --> 00:21:58.025
the fucking military precision it takes
to keep the pill going.

376
00:21:58.108 --> 00:22:00.068
Yeah. sometimes across time zones.

377
00:22:01.028 --> 00:22:03.530
Alarms going off
at random times of the day.

378
00:22:04.323 --> 00:22:06.116
Right? 3:00 a.m.. 5:00 p.m.

379
00:22:09.411 --> 00:22:13.540
Wake you up. remind you to eat this thing
within a 30-minute window.

380
00:22:13.623 --> 00:22:16.418
otherwise you might
accidentally create human life.

381
00:22:17.336 --> 00:22:19.504
-Like Zeus.
-[laughter]

382
00:22:20.255 --> 00:22:21.965
Men have no idea.

383
00:22:22.049 --> 00:22:23.175
Like. by the way. guys.

384
00:22:23.258 --> 00:22:25.844
you don't just walk into the pharmacy

385
00:22:25.927 --> 00:22:28.764
and buy the pill
like you're buying a Tic Tac.

386
00:22:29.473 --> 00:22:31.850
Like. next to the gum
just before you leave.

387
00:22:31.933 --> 00:22:33.894
"You want lemon-flavored?"

388
00:22:34.853 --> 00:22:37.105
Then you're good for one Olympic cycle.

389
00:22:37.189 --> 00:22:39.191
No. Assuming you can get a prescription.

390
00:22:39.274 --> 00:22:42.944
you have to try three different types
over the course of months

391
00:22:43.028 --> 00:22:45.572
to see which one fucks you up the least.

392
00:22:45.655 --> 00:22:48.658
You'll literally performing
clinical trials in yourself.

393
00:22:48.742 --> 00:22:50.744
like you're trying to find
a COVID vaccine.

394
00:22:51.495 --> 00:22:55.248
Your favorite flavor is the one that
causes the least amount of depression.

395
00:22:55.332 --> 00:22:56.833
No. men have no idea.

396
00:22:56.917 --> 00:22:58.251
[laughter]

397
00:22:58.335 --> 00:22:59.544
Yeah.

398
00:22:59.628 --> 00:23:02.047
Even if there was a pill for men.

399
00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:05.342
you'd never trust a man to take the pill.

400
00:23:07.636 --> 00:23:11.431
If some dumbass man was like.
"Yo. don't worry.

401
00:23:12.849 --> 00:23:14.267
I'm on the pill."

402
00:23:17.104 --> 00:23:19.106
you'd laugh in his face.

403
00:23:20.023 --> 00:23:23.735
You'd be like. "There's no fucking way
you're on the pill.

404
00:23:23.819 --> 00:23:27.405
At the very least. there is no way
you're doing it correctly.

405
00:23:28.406 --> 00:23:29.991
something that complicated.

406
00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:32.619
I don't even trust you
to take a shower every day.

407
00:23:32.702 --> 00:23:37.165
So. put a condom on or put that dick away.
otherwise this isn't happening."

408
00:23:37.249 --> 00:23:40.752
The variables that you have to be aware of
when you're on the pill

409
00:23:40.836 --> 00:23:42.671
just so you don't fuck it up.

410
00:23:42.754 --> 00:23:45.507
like the external factors
you have to keep track of.

411
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:48.510
like what you're eating.
just so you don't fuck up the pill.

412
00:23:48.593 --> 00:23:51.221
And by the way.
I don't even know enough about this.

413
00:23:51.304 --> 00:23:53.098
Okay. I'm not trying to mansplain this.

414
00:23:53.181 --> 00:23:57.102
I don't know what I'm talking about!
Google it after the show!

415
00:23:58.603 --> 00:24:02.190
All I know is what my wife told me
in passing. all right?

416
00:24:03.483 --> 00:24:08.864
But. apparently--
apparently. if you have diarrhea…

417
00:24:12.075 --> 00:24:15.453
Diarrhea can fuck up the pill.

418
00:24:17.414 --> 00:24:20.500
That's right.
Scares happening in this room right now.

419
00:24:21.668 --> 00:24:24.504
Because diarrhea causes babies.

420
00:24:26.381 --> 00:24:28.758
'Cause. apparently. if you have diarrhea.

421
00:24:28.842 --> 00:24:33.513
like. the-- the pill
can pass straight through you

422
00:24:34.472 --> 00:24:37.851
before your body
has time to absorb the hormones.

423
00:24:37.934 --> 00:24:41.354
So. diarrhea can fuck up the pill.

424
00:24:42.189 --> 00:24:44.482
That is the shittiest way to have a baby.

425
00:24:44.566 --> 00:24:45.692
[laughter]

426
00:24:45.775 --> 00:24:49.362
All right? How many--
How many diarrhea babies…

427
00:24:51.072 --> 00:24:53.283
are in this room right now?

428
00:24:55.368 --> 00:24:56.536
We'll never know.

429
00:24:57.704 --> 00:25:00.665
We'll never know.

430
00:25:01.666 --> 00:25:03.543
We'll never know
because you wouldn't know.

431
00:25:03.627 --> 00:25:06.004
first of all.
if diarrhea caused your baby.

432
00:25:06.713 --> 00:25:09.382
Why would you know that?
That's not common knowledge.

433
00:25:09.466 --> 00:25:12.260
In fact. in my experience.
diarrhea stops babies…

434
00:25:12.344 --> 00:25:13.970
[laughter]

435
00:25:14.054 --> 00:25:17.307
…from being made. all right.
so it's counterintuitive.

436
00:25:18.725 --> 00:25:21.853
Second of all.
even if you manage to power through that…

437
00:25:24.606 --> 00:25:29.694
and you knew for a fact that diarrhea
caused your baby. like. directly.

438
00:25:30.779 --> 00:25:33.114
why would you ever
pass that information on?

439
00:25:34.157 --> 00:25:35.951
Why would you tell anybody that?

440
00:25:36.993 --> 00:25:38.662
Much less your own child.

441
00:25:39.412 --> 00:25:42.999
Like. your kid is asking you.
"Hey. Daddy. where do babies come from?"

442
00:25:44.334 --> 00:25:46.294
[sighs] "Well…

443
00:25:46.378 --> 00:25:49.756
uh. a man and woman fall in love.

444
00:25:49.839 --> 00:25:53.176
uh. the woman has some bad oysters.

445
00:25:54.427 --> 00:25:56.888
some evil stuff comes out of her butt.

446
00:25:56.972 --> 00:25:59.891
and you're a blessing.
is what I'm trying to say."

447
00:25:59.975 --> 00:26:01.393
[laughter]

448
00:26:02.978 --> 00:26:06.606
Just curious
which way this room leans politically.

449
00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:10.527
You guys left or right in this room?
I got jokes for both sides.

450
00:26:11.736 --> 00:26:13.905
At this point in the Netflix special.

451
00:26:13.989 --> 00:26:17.200
I want there to be two boxes
that drop down.

452
00:26:18.076 --> 00:26:19.744
Like a Choose Your Own Adventure.

453
00:26:19.828 --> 00:26:22.622
[laughter]

454
00:26:22.706 --> 00:26:26.126
And you can pick which side
of the political spectrum you're on.

455
00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.796
Right? And then no matter what you pick.

456
00:26:29.879 --> 00:26:32.173
it just goes to the same place. [chuckles]

457
00:26:36.594 --> 00:26:39.055
I think we have the technology
to do that. [laughs]

458
00:26:40.515 --> 00:26:42.058
Just a useless graphic.

459
00:26:42.142 --> 00:26:43.727
[babbles]

460
00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:45.603
It's a metaphor for the country.

461
00:26:46.479 --> 00:26:51.943
Ah. I know you guys are thinking:
"Ronny. stop with the politics. please.

462
00:26:52.027 --> 00:26:54.571
You keep talking about politics.
It's so stressful.

463
00:26:54.654 --> 00:26:58.033
We didn't come out tonight
and dress up. for once.

464
00:26:58.116 --> 00:27:00.827
to come out and talk about politics.

465
00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:03.538
Just move on.
It's making us very uncomfortable.

466
00:27:03.621 --> 00:27:07.250
Please. if we wanted to hear
about politics. we'd go on Twitter.

467
00:27:08.043 --> 00:27:09.836
This is not the place for it."

468
00:27:09.919 --> 00:27:12.380
I hear you. and I agree.

469
00:27:14.924 --> 00:27:16.968
I'm very pro-Brexit.

470
00:27:19.429 --> 00:27:21.765
Just hear me out here. all right?

471
00:27:22.515 --> 00:27:25.310
I love Brexit

472
00:27:26.186 --> 00:27:29.981
because I hate the United Kingdom
and I hope Brexit destroys that country.

473
00:27:30.065 --> 00:27:31.649
[laughter. scattered cheers]

474
00:27:31.733 --> 00:27:32.734
Yeah.

475
00:27:33.318 --> 00:27:38.365
And that's not racist
because the United Kingdom is not a race.

476
00:27:39.783 --> 00:27:43.578
I used to love the UK. man.
I used to love the UK.

477
00:27:43.661 --> 00:27:45.997
UK is "United Kingdom." for Americans.

478
00:27:46.081 --> 00:27:47.999
[laughter]

479
00:27:48.708 --> 00:27:51.669
If you grew up
in a former British colony like I did--

480
00:27:51.753 --> 00:27:53.546
Singapore. Malaysia. Australia--

481
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:56.591
we put the British on a pedestal.

482
00:27:56.674 --> 00:27:58.468
We thought they were awesome.

483
00:27:58.551 --> 00:28:01.596
I mean. technically.
America is also a former British colony.

484
00:28:01.679 --> 00:28:05.266
but you guys are too cool for school.
so you're not part of the Commonwealth.

485
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:09.562
I get it. I'm just saying. if you come
from a real British colony like I did.

486
00:28:09.646 --> 00:28:11.815
we thought the British were the shit.

487
00:28:11.898 --> 00:28:13.691
We were like.
"Oh. my God. they're amazing."

488
00:28:13.775 --> 00:28:17.195
Everything they did
was the best way to do that.

489
00:28:17.278 --> 00:28:22.575
Every institution they installed
endures till today.

490
00:28:22.659 --> 00:28:26.162
In Singapore. we still use it
because we thought it was so efficient.

491
00:28:26.246 --> 00:28:29.916
Like in Singapore. we still use
the British system of government:

492
00:28:29.999 --> 00:28:32.043
the Westminster parliamentary system.

493
00:28:32.127 --> 00:28:36.047
probably the best expression
of Western democracy ever invented--

494
00:28:36.131 --> 00:28:37.173
ever implemented--

495
00:28:37.257 --> 00:28:40.718
Okay. it's not perfect.
but at least you have options. right?

496
00:28:40.802 --> 00:28:42.637
You can be gay and like guns.

497
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.347
[laughter]

498
00:28:44.431 --> 00:28:46.808
It's not this binary shit all the time.

499
00:28:47.726 --> 00:28:52.105
Like in Singapore. we still use
the British education system in Singapore.

500
00:28:52.188 --> 00:28:54.983
When you leave high school in Singapore.
you do the exam.

501
00:28:55.066 --> 00:28:58.820
the University of Cambridge O Levels.

502
00:28:58.903 --> 00:29:04.492
We do it in Singapore.
We mail the exam to Cambridge University.

503
00:29:04.576 --> 00:29:09.873
"Cambridge. please tell us. Are we
smart enough to leave high school. please?

504
00:29:09.956 --> 00:29:11.833
We don't give a fuck
what anyone else thinks.

505
00:29:11.916 --> 00:29:14.502
What do you think? British people.
tell us. are we smart enough?"

506
00:29:14.586 --> 00:29:17.464
The University of Cambridge will mark
the exam and they'll mail it back.

507
00:29:17.547 --> 00:29:19.549
They'll be like.
"Yeah. you're smart. you're smart.

508
00:29:19.632 --> 00:29:21.926
You're fucking dumb. Go fuck yourself."

509
00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:23.011
Yeah!

510
00:29:23.094 --> 00:29:25.263
And then we'll be like.
"Thank you. Thank you. British.

511
00:29:25.346 --> 00:29:26.890
Thank you for telling us."

512
00:29:27.724 --> 00:29:32.854
In Singapore. we still use
the British electrical system.

513
00:29:32.937 --> 00:29:36.149
In Singapore. we still use
the British three-pin plug.

514
00:29:36.232 --> 00:29:40.153
that three-pin. solid. chunky plug

515
00:29:40.236 --> 00:29:43.323
with three solid pins sticking out.

516
00:29:43.406 --> 00:29:45.658
You stick it in the wall.
it's never coming out.

517
00:29:46.326 --> 00:29:48.703
Yeah. not that stupid American two-prong.

518
00:29:48.787 --> 00:29:52.582
You stick it in. it falls out
of its own weight like a limp dick. right?

519
00:29:52.665 --> 00:29:54.667
[whimpering]

520
00:29:57.086 --> 00:30:00.590
"Thomas Edison." [whimpering continues]

521
00:30:00.673 --> 00:30:03.885
No. man.
We use that solid British three-pin.

522
00:30:03.968 --> 00:30:07.931
Conquered half the world
with this imperial engineering. right?

523
00:30:08.014 --> 00:30:10.225
You stick in the wall.
it's never coming out.

524
00:30:10.308 --> 00:30:12.977
You trip over it.
your whole wall comes down instead.

525
00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:20.109
In Singapore. we still watch
British comedy culture.

526
00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:24.197
It's the dominant comedy culture
in Singapore. Mr. Bean.

527
00:30:25.782 --> 00:30:31.037
Mr. Fucking Bean
is the biggest comedian in Southeast Asia.

528
00:30:31.955 --> 00:30:33.498
In Southeast Asia. there's no--

529
00:30:33.581 --> 00:30:36.543
In Singapore and Malaysia.
there's no Chappelle.

530
00:30:36.626 --> 00:30:38.837
there's no Chris Rock.
there's no Seinfeld.

531
00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.171
It's Mr. Bean.

532
00:30:41.422 --> 00:30:44.634
Mr. Bean
was the greatest comedian of all time.

533
00:30:44.717 --> 00:30:46.427
with his stupid fucking face.

534
00:30:51.474 --> 00:30:53.685
The greatest-- The greatest comedian.

535
00:30:57.647 --> 00:30:58.731
Fuck that guy.

536
00:30:58.815 --> 00:31:00.024
[laughter]

537
00:31:00.108 --> 00:31:03.278
Fuck it. Not to mention the fact
that he fucked my friend's girlfriend.

538
00:31:04.153 --> 00:31:06.322
But. yeah. if you wanna hear that story.

539
00:31:06.406 --> 00:31:11.995
just google James Acaster on Vimeo.

540
00:31:12.078 --> 00:31:16.624
He's my friend and a comic.
and he talks about that story very openly.

541
00:31:17.876 --> 00:31:20.044
It's not really my story to tell.

542
00:31:20.128 --> 00:31:25.091
so let me plug his special a little bit
in my special. [laughs]

543
00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:28.344
But I know what you're thinking.

544
00:31:29.512 --> 00:31:33.224
"What would it be like to fuck Mr. Bean?"

545
00:31:33.308 --> 00:31:35.143
[laughter]

546
00:31:36.519 --> 00:31:39.522
And I can't say for certain.

547
00:31:39.606 --> 00:31:43.401
but I imagine
it would be something like this.

548
00:31:43.484 --> 00:31:45.486
[babbles]

549
00:31:48.114 --> 00:31:50.575
And that's not even the reason
why I hate the UK.

550
00:31:51.993 --> 00:31:57.999
I hate the UK because when I was
three years into stand-up comedy.

551
00:31:58.082 --> 00:32:01.085
I got invited
to the Soho Theatre in London

552
00:32:01.169 --> 00:32:03.421
to do a one-hour comedy show.

553
00:32:03.504 --> 00:32:06.424
It was a big deal at the time.
It's a very prestigious venue.

554
00:32:06.507 --> 00:32:07.926
The Soho Theatre in London

555
00:32:08.009 --> 00:32:11.137
is like the piazza of
the British comedy community.

556
00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:14.432
It's the gatekeeper
of what's cool and what's not cool

557
00:32:14.515 --> 00:32:16.392
in the British comedy establishment.

558
00:32:16.476 --> 00:32:20.104
And getting invited there was cool.
especially coming from Southeast Asia.

559
00:32:20.188 --> 00:32:24.692
where it's like nothing you do in English
in Southeast Asia is worth a damn

560
00:32:24.776 --> 00:32:28.446
unless white people cosign it.
and this was the ultimate cosign.

561
00:32:28.529 --> 00:32:32.367
It was like. "Oh. my God. the English
are asking you to perform comedy

562
00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:35.828
in English to the people
who invented the language?

563
00:32:35.912 --> 00:32:39.540
It's out of control. You got to go.
Go. the motherland is calling you."

564
00:32:39.624 --> 00:32:41.417
I was like. "Fuck yeah.
Of course. I'll go."

565
00:32:41.501 --> 00:32:44.212
I was excited to prove myself
on the international stage.

566
00:32:44.295 --> 00:32:47.340
so I gathered together
all the material I had.

567
00:32:47.423 --> 00:32:51.094
I cobbled it together
into barely. like. an hour worth of stuff.

568
00:32:51.177 --> 00:32:52.804
whatever I'd written to that point.

569
00:32:52.887 --> 00:32:57.433
Um. I put it in a suitcase
and I went to London like Paddington Bear.

570
00:32:57.517 --> 00:32:58.518
Right?

571
00:33:00.979 --> 00:33:04.983
And I got there and I got a two-week run

572
00:33:05.066 --> 00:33:07.026
at the Soho Theatre in London.

573
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:10.113
My first time in London.
first time performing in London.

574
00:33:10.196 --> 00:33:14.242
I remember opening night
of my two-week run.

575
00:33:14.325 --> 00:33:19.330
I was two-thirds into the show.
and the show was going okay.

576
00:33:19.414 --> 00:33:22.000
Uh. the energy
was much like it is right now.

577
00:33:22.625 --> 00:33:25.253
Just fucking.
"Where is this going right here?"

578
00:33:27.005 --> 00:33:30.425
And I did this joke about how--

579
00:33:31.217 --> 00:33:33.177
It's from
my first five minutes of comedy--

580
00:33:33.261 --> 00:33:34.971
It was a joke about how

581
00:33:35.054 --> 00:33:38.725
Asian parents love their kids
more than white people parents.

582
00:33:39.475 --> 00:33:41.728
So the joke was something like:

583
00:33:41.811 --> 00:33:45.690
"People always ask me what my parents
think about me doing stand-up comedy.

584
00:33:45.773 --> 00:33:48.234
but you never ask
these other white comedians that question

585
00:33:48.317 --> 00:33:50.695
because you know their parents
don't give a fuck about them."

586
00:33:52.947 --> 00:33:55.783
So. I did that joke in London.

587
00:33:55.867 --> 00:33:59.537
and some people laughed
and some people didn't laugh.

588
00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:00.872
just like in this room.

589
00:34:00.955 --> 00:34:02.832
[laughter]

590
00:34:02.915 --> 00:34:04.751
But that's what it is. though.

591
00:34:04.834 --> 00:34:08.337
That's the ups and downs of comedy. right?
That's what you do.

592
00:34:08.421 --> 00:34:10.757
You build it up
and then you pull the rug out

593
00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.801
by saying something outrageous
just to break the tension.

594
00:34:13.885 --> 00:34:16.429
That's the only way I know how to do it.
That's 101.

595
00:34:16.512 --> 00:34:19.348
So I did that bit. Some people laughed
and some people didn't laugh.

596
00:34:19.432 --> 00:34:21.809
And then we just moved on
to the next bit. right?

597
00:34:21.893 --> 00:34:23.853
But before I could move on.

598
00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:27.148
this old British person

599
00:34:27.231 --> 00:34:29.942
in the second row of the Soho Theatre

600
00:34:30.026 --> 00:34:32.862
stood up and started yelling.

601
00:34:32.945 --> 00:34:36.616
And I don't want to gender this person.

602
00:34:36.699 --> 00:34:41.496
But just imagine an old British person
complaining during a show.

603
00:34:41.579 --> 00:34:44.457
and what gender do you see? Right?

604
00:34:45.208 --> 00:34:46.626
So anyway he stood up…

605
00:34:46.709 --> 00:34:48.461
[laughter]

606
00:34:48.544 --> 00:34:52.090
…and he said.
"Fuck you. my parents loved me!"

607
00:34:53.257 --> 00:34:56.427
And I was like. "What?"
And he goes. "My parents loved me. man.

608
00:34:56.511 --> 00:34:57.970
And we invented universities

609
00:34:58.054 --> 00:35:00.723
and we invented
the Westminster parliamentary system."

610
00:35:01.307 --> 00:35:04.852
And he started going on like
a Western civilization open mic. right?

611
00:35:04.936 --> 00:35:05.937
[laughter]

612
00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:08.439
And I was like.
"Oh. Oh. no. no. no. No. no.

613
00:35:08.523 --> 00:35:11.567
No. sir. That-- That joke
wasn't about you at all.

614
00:35:11.651 --> 00:35:14.570
Don't take it personally.
That wasn't about you and your parents.

615
00:35:14.654 --> 00:35:18.074
If anything. it's about me and my parents
and how society views us.

616
00:35:18.157 --> 00:35:21.661
So don't take that personally.
That wasn't about you at all. Please."

617
00:35:21.744 --> 00:35:25.164
And he just wouldn't let it go. saying.
"Fuck you. my parents loved me."

618
00:35:25.248 --> 00:35:29.335
And we argued for two minutes
about whether his parents loved him.

619
00:35:30.586 --> 00:35:32.505
And I knew what that energy was.

620
00:35:32.588 --> 00:35:35.675
I felt that energy growing up.
It's very familiar.

621
00:35:35.758 --> 00:35:40.054
It's the British expat in Asia.
"Don't tell us we suck.

622
00:35:40.138 --> 00:35:43.099
we used to own your region.
live without consequences

623
00:35:43.182 --> 00:35:45.726
because we have exit strategy" energy.

624
00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:48.187
And so I just went. "You know what. man?

625
00:35:48.771 --> 00:35:52.567
Like. we're two-thirds
into my show right now.

626
00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:55.194
We've been arguing about
whether your parents loved you

627
00:35:55.278 --> 00:35:59.740
for two minutes.
which is an eternity in a live show.

628
00:36:00.366 --> 00:36:04.203
I don't think I'm going to convince you
that I'm a good comedian.

629
00:36:04.287 --> 00:36:06.330
Maybe you should just go."

630
00:36:06.956 --> 00:36:12.545
And he said. "I paid £10 to be here.
I'm not fucking going anywhere."

631
00:36:13.421 --> 00:36:17.508
Which is a very unusual stance
to take at a comedy show.

632
00:36:17.592 --> 00:36:19.927
[laughter]

633
00:36:20.011 --> 00:36:26.767
And so I just said.
"Well. okay. I'll pay you £20 to leave."

634
00:36:27.685 --> 00:36:29.145
And so I did.

635
00:36:30.313 --> 00:36:31.564
And he left.

636
00:36:33.649 --> 00:36:36.027
And that's a terrible business model
for comedy. by the way.

637
00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:38.196
That will-- That will never happen again.

638
00:36:38.279 --> 00:36:42.033
No refunds ever-- ever again.
I don't give a fuck what happens tonight.

639
00:36:42.116 --> 00:36:44.827
Your money is already mine.
Do you understand?

640
00:36:44.911 --> 00:36:46.996
I don't care.
You can storm the stage if you want.

641
00:36:47.079 --> 00:36:48.831
I'll have an early night. all right?

642
00:36:49.707 --> 00:36:53.586
You decide how long you want the show to
go for. 'cause your money is already mine.

643
00:36:54.962 --> 00:36:58.299
And all that actually happened.
He stood up. he yelled at me.

644
00:36:58.382 --> 00:37:00.551
I paid him £20 and then he left.

645
00:37:00.635 --> 00:37:02.887
And that's not even the reason
why I hate the UK.

646
00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.599
I have conservative parents.

647
00:37:06.682 --> 00:37:11.395
I was taught if something goes wrong.
blame yourself forever.

648
00:37:11.479 --> 00:37:12.521
[laughter]

649
00:37:12.605 --> 00:37:14.941
And I'm like.
"Yeah. I can get behind that.

650
00:37:15.024 --> 00:37:17.151
I subscribed to that YouTube channel.

651
00:37:17.235 --> 00:37:19.445
Let's do this.
Let's take some personal responsibility.

652
00:37:19.528 --> 00:37:23.532
I gotta get better. I will get better.
I gotta get better jokes.

653
00:37:23.616 --> 00:37:26.953
I gotta get better at dealing with people.
I'll come back.

654
00:37:27.036 --> 00:37:30.164
I'll come back
and I'll win these motherfuckers over.

655
00:37:30.248 --> 00:37:33.542
I'll come back
and I'll be undeniable to the British."

656
00:37:33.626 --> 00:37:37.255
And so. for the next two years.
I worked on my next hour of comedy. right?

657
00:37:37.338 --> 00:37:41.092
I tried to make it
more universal. less parochial.

658
00:37:41.175 --> 00:37:42.969
more whimsical. right?

659
00:37:43.052 --> 00:37:45.304
More of this shit. [babbles]

660
00:37:47.265 --> 00:37:50.184
With a teddy bear or whatever the fuck
I thought they wanted.

661
00:37:50.268 --> 00:37:52.395
Just pandering the shit out of it.

662
00:37:52.478 --> 00:37:55.940
And two years later.
I got invited back to the Soho Theatre

663
00:37:56.023 --> 00:37:59.193
for another two-week run.
and I was raring to go.

664
00:37:59.277 --> 00:38:03.114
I was like. "Fuck yeah." Excited to go.
I was like Rocky after the montage. right?

665
00:38:03.197 --> 00:38:06.492
"You killed my Black friend.
I'm here to kill you now. Let's do this."

666
00:38:06.575 --> 00:38:09.245
I'm really bad with analogies.
but you know what I'm trying to say.

667
00:38:09.787 --> 00:38:11.414
So I got invited back.

668
00:38:11.497 --> 00:38:17.128
I remember opening night of my second
two-week run at the Soho Theatre.

669
00:38:17.211 --> 00:38:23.050
I was three-quarters into the show
and I did this joke about how--

670
00:38:23.134 --> 00:38:25.428
And keep in mind
what I'm about to tell you

671
00:38:25.511 --> 00:38:30.016
is a joke from a much younger person
and a much more inexperienced comedian.

672
00:38:30.099 --> 00:38:33.436
Okay? So if it helps you process this.

673
00:38:33.519 --> 00:38:38.566
just view what I'm about to say
as being in quotes.

674
00:38:38.649 --> 00:38:42.236
Okay? I am not actually
doing this joke right now.

675
00:38:43.279 --> 00:38:49.160
I am quoting another comedian
who did this joke in London in 2012.

676
00:38:50.369 --> 00:38:53.164
That other comedian
just happens to be me. All right?

677
00:38:53.247 --> 00:38:54.290
[laughter]

678
00:38:54.373 --> 00:38:57.460
Also. I was a lot younger
and more inexperienced

679
00:38:57.543 --> 00:39:01.130
and my crowd was also a lot younger
back then. okay?

680
00:39:01.213 --> 00:39:05.843
It wasn't this divorcée.
babysitter crowd. all right?

681
00:39:05.926 --> 00:39:08.054
-[laughter]
-I don't know what happened.

682
00:39:08.137 --> 00:39:10.598
My audience has aged horribly with me.

683
00:39:11.766 --> 00:39:13.601
I can't explain it either.
but here we are.

684
00:39:13.684 --> 00:39:16.187
so let's just try
to make the most of this.

685
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:19.190
Um. so view what I'm about to say
through that lens.

686
00:39:19.273 --> 00:39:21.150
Younger comic.
younger audience. all right?

687
00:39:21.233 --> 00:39:24.362
Or come cancel me.
I don't actually care anymore.

688
00:39:24.445 --> 00:39:26.447
So I did this joke about how--

689
00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:27.573
It started with:

690
00:39:27.656 --> 00:39:30.201
When I was in high school.
I was really awkward around girls.

691
00:39:30.284 --> 00:39:33.913
If I had a crush on a girl
and she didn't like me back immediately.

692
00:39:33.996 --> 00:39:37.666
I took that as a sign that
I needed to try harder to win her over.

693
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:40.586
so I tried to show her my sincerity
by buying her flowers.

694
00:39:40.669 --> 00:39:42.713
I'd buy her chocolates.
I'd give it to her in class.

695
00:39:42.797 --> 00:39:45.966
I'd hand-draw comics where
the ending was we got together. right?

696
00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:47.885
Just horribly embarrassing shit

697
00:39:47.968 --> 00:39:51.806
that I still scream about in bed
17 years later. right?

698
00:39:51.889 --> 00:39:56.685
And. like most guys that age.
I didn't know how to control my emotions

699
00:39:56.769 --> 00:39:59.814
and guys are already
base-level dumb. right?

700
00:39:59.897 --> 00:40:02.733
Then you add hormones on that.
That's just like dumb on dumb.

701
00:40:02.817 --> 00:40:05.528
You start going down that spiral
that most guys go down.

702
00:40:05.611 --> 00:40:08.531
which is. you try to analyze
how to get girls to like you.

703
00:40:08.614 --> 00:40:11.200
You start trying to break it down
like math.

704
00:40:11.283 --> 00:40:13.786
And you're like.
"Okay. you-- you gotta be a bad boy.

705
00:40:13.869 --> 00:40:16.080
They don't like nice guys."
Blah. blah. blah.

706
00:40:16.163 --> 00:40:21.502
And it took me so long to realize
the secret about women.

707
00:40:21.585 --> 00:40:26.465
which is that. if you like a girl
and she doesn't like you back.

708
00:40:26.549 --> 00:40:31.637
all you have to remember
is that women don't owe you anything.

709
00:40:32.304 --> 00:40:35.433
That's what it is.
Women don't owe you anything.

710
00:40:35.516 --> 00:40:38.436
-[person] Yeah!
-Yeah. so guys get hung up.

711
00:40:38.519 --> 00:40:41.856
Some guys get hung up and they're like.
"Yeah. but I bought her flowers.

712
00:40:42.481 --> 00:40:44.150
Why didn't she want to fuck me?"

713
00:40:44.233 --> 00:40:46.485
Because they don't owe you anything.

714
00:40:46.569 --> 00:40:49.280
"Yeah. but I spent the weekend
fixing her computer.

715
00:40:49.947 --> 00:40:51.532
Why doesn't she want to suck my dick?"

716
00:40:51.615 --> 00:40:54.285
Because they don't owe you anything.
Get it in your head.

717
00:40:54.368 --> 00:40:57.872
Women don't owe you anything.
It doesn't matter what you do.

718
00:40:57.955 --> 00:40:59.748
That's on you.
Whatever you do. that's on you.

719
00:40:59.832 --> 00:41:02.460
Don't put that on them.
That's your shit. right?

720
00:41:02.543 --> 00:41:06.297
Women aren't just vending machines
you put kindness into until sex falls out.

721
00:41:07.882 --> 00:41:10.217
Okay? They don't owe you anything.

722
00:41:10.301 --> 00:41:12.094
Women aren't just like coffee cards

723
00:41:12.178 --> 00:41:15.055
where you get ten stamps
and then you fuck. all right?

724
00:41:15.139 --> 00:41:17.099
They don't owe you anything.
Get it in your head.

725
00:41:17.183 --> 00:41:18.476
They don't owe you anything.

726
00:41:18.559 --> 00:41:22.062
Anything you do. that's on you.
That's your shit. Figure it out.

727
00:41:22.938 --> 00:41:26.108
And so. if you're a guy
and you like a girl

728
00:41:26.192 --> 00:41:28.319
and she doesn't like you back. okay--

729
00:41:28.402 --> 00:41:30.404
And keep in mind.
I'm still in quotes here.

730
00:41:30.488 --> 00:41:32.406
[laughter]

731
00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:35.951
You take all the energy
that you're wasting externally

732
00:41:36.035 --> 00:41:39.497
on buying flowers and chocolates
and hand-drawing comics--

733
00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:41.290
Okay. you cut that shit out.

734
00:41:41.373 --> 00:41:44.752
And you direct that energy back inwards.
Focus on yourself.

735
00:41:45.419 --> 00:41:48.088
Make yourself a better person every day.
That's your goal.

736
00:41:48.172 --> 00:41:51.217
Make yourself a better person today
than you were yesterday.

737
00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:54.094
even if it's just 0.5%. right?

738
00:41:54.178 --> 00:41:57.097
And the marginal gains
will add up and they'll add up.

739
00:41:57.181 --> 00:42:01.602
And as a man.
your value will increase with age. right?

740
00:42:01.685 --> 00:42:04.021
And as a woman.
their value will decrease with age.

741
00:42:04.104 --> 00:42:07.316
And when that line exceeds that line
and Y equals MX plus C.

742
00:42:07.399 --> 00:42:09.026
you get all that shit back. okay?

743
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:12.238
You play the long game
and you wait these motherfuckers out.

744
00:42:12.321 --> 00:42:13.864
[laughter]

745
00:42:13.948 --> 00:42:15.658
Because time is on your side.

746
00:42:18.494 --> 00:42:20.246
So anyway. I did that joke.

747
00:42:20.329 --> 00:42:23.499
and. uh. some people laughed
and some people didn't laugh.

748
00:42:23.582 --> 00:42:25.668
-just like in this room. right?
-[laughter]

749
00:42:25.751 --> 00:42:28.921
But that's what it is. though.
That's the ups and downs of comedy.

750
00:42:29.004 --> 00:42:30.589
I don't know how else to do it.

751
00:42:30.673 --> 00:42:32.800
You build it up
and then you pull the rug out.

752
00:42:34.218 --> 00:42:35.886
I don't know how else to do it. [chuckles]

753
00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:39.557
So I did that bit and. um--
oh. I didn't even get to the punch line.

754
00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:41.392
I got as far as the setup.

755
00:42:41.475 --> 00:42:43.936
So. in my second two-week run

756
00:42:44.019 --> 00:42:46.564
at the Soho Theatre in London.
opening night.

757
00:42:46.647 --> 00:42:49.567
three-quarters into the show.
I get as far as:

758
00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:51.986
"When I was in high school.
I was awkward around girls.

759
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:54.530
If I had a crush on a girl
and she didn't like me back immediately.

760
00:42:54.613 --> 00:42:57.283
I took that as a sign
I needed to try harder to win her over.

761
00:42:57.366 --> 00:42:59.201
so I'd buy her flowers.
I'd buy her chocolates.

762
00:42:59.285 --> 00:43:02.663
I'd hand-draw comics where we got together
just to show her my sincerity."

763
00:43:02.746 --> 00:43:04.915
And at this point in the setup.

764
00:43:04.999 --> 00:43:08.752
this young British person
sitting in the same place

765
00:43:08.836 --> 00:43:11.630
the old British person was
two years earlier.

766
00:43:11.714 --> 00:43:14.925
This person stood up and started yelling.

767
00:43:15.009 --> 00:43:17.803
And I don't want to gender this person.

768
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:22.808
But just imagine a young British person
complaining in the middle of a show.

769
00:43:22.891 --> 00:43:24.560
and who do you see in your head?

770
00:43:25.477 --> 00:43:27.062
Right. so anyway. she stood up…

771
00:43:28.272 --> 00:43:32.276
and she said. "I'm sick of men
making excuses for sexual assault.

772
00:43:32.359 --> 00:43:34.945
What you're saying
is perpetuating rape culture.

773
00:43:35.029 --> 00:43:36.322
Hormones are no excuse."

774
00:43:36.405 --> 00:43:38.741
And I was like. "Whoa. Whoa!
Whoa. no. no. no.

775
00:43:38.824 --> 00:43:42.077
This isn't a story about rape.
I promise you. this isn't a rape story.

776
00:43:42.161 --> 00:43:44.788
This is a story about
awkward. unrequited teenage love.

777
00:43:45.664 --> 00:43:48.125
Yeah. and I'm on your side.
I'm on your side. by the way.

778
00:43:48.208 --> 00:43:50.544
I say 50 times.
'Women don't owe you anything.'

779
00:43:50.628 --> 00:43:53.297
I'm on your side. You just gotta let me
turn the corner on this

780
00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:54.840
because this is a comedy show.

781
00:43:54.923 --> 00:43:56.925
You got to let me turn the corner on this

782
00:43:57.009 --> 00:43:59.470
and I've got a Shakespearean quote
about women and vending machines.

783
00:43:59.553 --> 00:44:01.388
You're going to love it. I promise you.

784
00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:06.268
I-- I promise you.
you're gonna get behind me on this one.

785
00:44:06.352 --> 00:44:08.354
Just let me turn the corner on this.

786
00:44:08.437 --> 00:44:10.230
And. yeah. okay.
maybe you'll hate the ending.

787
00:44:10.314 --> 00:44:12.566
But that's what it is.
It's the ups and downs of comedy.

788
00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:15.277
Some stuff you don't like.
but you're gonna like the whole package.

789
00:44:15.361 --> 00:44:17.196
I promise you. I'm on your side."

790
00:44:17.279 --> 00:44:19.281
And she just wouldn't let me continue.

791
00:44:19.365 --> 00:44:23.160
She just kept accusing me
of perpetuating rape culture.

792
00:44:23.243 --> 00:44:26.038
So finally I just said.
"Well. you know what?

793
00:44:26.747 --> 00:44:29.875
We're three-quarters
into the show right now.

794
00:44:29.958 --> 00:44:33.504
We've been arguing about rape
for two minutes.

795
00:44:33.587 --> 00:44:36.882
I don't think I'm gonna convince you
that I'm not a piece of shit.

796
00:44:37.675 --> 00:44:39.051
Maybe you should just go."

797
00:44:39.802 --> 00:44:45.265
And she said. "Well. I paid £10 to
be here. I'm not fucking going anywhere."

798
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:48.018
Because my ticket prices
hadn't increased in two years.

799
00:44:48.102 --> 00:44:50.104
[laughter]

800
00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:55.275
So I just said. "Well. I'll pay you

801
00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:58.904
£10 to leave."

802
00:44:59.863 --> 00:45:00.989
And so I did.

803
00:45:02.616 --> 00:45:03.700
And she left.

804
00:45:06.203 --> 00:45:08.914
And that's why women get paid
less than men per hour.

805
00:45:12.418 --> 00:45:16.255
Because they don't know
how to push the advantage

806
00:45:17.131 --> 00:45:19.842
in business negotiations…

807
00:45:22.428 --> 00:45:26.181
is what I would say
if I was a terrible person.

808
00:45:27.599 --> 00:45:30.727
But I'm not.
so obviously. I didn't say that.

809
00:45:30.811 --> 00:45:34.773
That'd be a horrible thing to even think.
much less say out loud.

810
00:45:34.857 --> 00:45:36.275
Who the fuck would do that?

811
00:45:36.358 --> 00:45:37.359
[laughter]

812
00:45:37.443 --> 00:45:41.530
But that's what it is. though.
That's the ups and downs of comedy.

813
00:45:41.613 --> 00:45:44.116
You build it up
and then you fucking pull the rug out.

814
00:45:44.199 --> 00:45:48.120
I don't know why it works. It just does.
I don't know why it's okay.

815
00:45:48.203 --> 00:45:51.707
Maybe it's because we're all sharing
the same space and time together.

816
00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:54.001
the same moment.
so we get what's going on.

817
00:45:54.084 --> 00:45:55.335
Maybe it's not okay.

818
00:45:56.253 --> 00:45:57.504
I don't know.

819
00:45:57.588 --> 00:46:00.674
It's also not my job to teach you
how to fucking do comedy. all right?

820
00:46:00.757 --> 00:46:03.093
If you wanna find out how to do this.
do an open mic

821
00:46:03.177 --> 00:46:05.929
multiple times a night for the next decade
and you come and tell me.

822
00:46:06.013 --> 00:46:07.764
If you think there's no artistry to this.

823
00:46:07.848 --> 00:46:09.808
if you think
it's just about saying offensive shit

824
00:46:09.892 --> 00:46:12.519
or never saying anything offensive ever.
then you fucking go do it.

825
00:46:12.603 --> 00:46:13.687
You do it and you tell me.

826
00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:15.856
And that's not even the reason
why I hate the UK.

827
00:46:19.359 --> 00:46:23.363
I hate the UK just because
of their attitude towards comedy.

828
00:46:23.447 --> 00:46:24.823
It's just so snobbish.

829
00:46:24.907 --> 00:46:27.826
It's so snobbish.
I love doing comedy in America.

830
00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:31.455
It's the best. What a joy.
What a joy to do comedy in America.

831
00:46:31.538 --> 00:46:33.457
-It's the best.
-[person] Yeah!

832
00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:34.791
It's the best.

833
00:46:35.667 --> 00:46:38.545
It is. It makes sense
that comedy was invented here.

834
00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:41.173
Of course you guys invented this.
It's crazy. right?

835
00:46:41.256 --> 00:46:43.258
There's a real spirit
of innovation here. right?

836
00:46:43.342 --> 00:46:46.094
It's the same energy that allows you
to innovate to the point

837
00:46:46.178 --> 00:46:49.056
-where you get the iPhone 13 Max Pro.
-[person] Yeah!

838
00:46:49.139 --> 00:46:52.434
Is the 12 okay? 12 is amazing.
But fuck it. keep going.

839
00:46:52.518 --> 00:46:55.020
Come on. We can put
some more lenses on this thing.

840
00:46:55.103 --> 00:46:57.397
There's still some more surface area.
Come on.

841
00:46:57.481 --> 00:46:59.816
It's the same energy
that allows you to create

842
00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:03.320
a miracle mRNA vaccine in under a year…

843
00:47:03.403 --> 00:47:05.405
-[cheering. whooping]
-Yeah.

844
00:47:07.449 --> 00:47:10.744
…that works. and then refuse to take it.

845
00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:13.789
That is the most American shit ever.

846
00:47:13.872 --> 00:47:15.165
America is like.

847
00:47:16.124 --> 00:47:20.504
"The whole world is in trouble.
Let's use everything we've ever learned.

848
00:47:20.587 --> 00:47:23.632
our entire knowledge base.
every resource at our disposal.

849
00:47:23.715 --> 00:47:25.342
every immigrant who ever got a PhD.

850
00:47:25.425 --> 00:47:28.762
every local-born PhD student.
let's combine forces

851
00:47:28.845 --> 00:47:33.016
and create this miracle mRNA vaccine
in under a year.

852
00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:36.270
We did it. and it fucking works.
And fuck you! We're not gonna take it!

853
00:47:36.353 --> 00:47:39.856
Fuck you! We're not taking that shit.
We're not taking that.

854
00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:41.733
You take it. We're not taking it.
You take it.

855
00:47:41.817 --> 00:47:44.111
Oh. what? Oh. what?
You want it? Oh. you want it?

856
00:47:44.194 --> 00:47:46.947
Well. fuck that.
We're not gonna give it to you.

857
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:49.741
We'd rather throw it in the river.
We'd rather throw it in the river.

858
00:47:49.825 --> 00:47:52.661
Go suck it up from a river.
Suck it. Suck my dick.

859
00:47:52.744 --> 00:47:55.163
Fuck you and fuck us.
Fuck you and fuck us.

860
00:47:55.247 --> 00:47:56.498
Oh. what? What? Does it work?

861
00:47:56.582 --> 00:47:59.668
Oh. my God. it works like a charm.
There's like a 90% efficacy.

862
00:47:59.751 --> 00:48:02.546
It blows all simulations out of the water.
but fuck that shit.

863
00:48:02.629 --> 00:48:05.382
We're not taking it.
Fuck you and fuck us."

864
00:48:05.465 --> 00:48:07.759
That is the most American shit ever.

865
00:48:08.635 --> 00:48:10.012
[laughs]

866
00:48:15.726 --> 00:48:19.396
I love doing comedy in America.
It's the best. It's the best. man.

867
00:48:19.479 --> 00:48:21.940
It's the best. We all get it.
We all get comedy in America.

868
00:48:22.024 --> 00:48:24.651
We get the rhythm of it. right?
More or less.

869
00:48:24.735 --> 00:48:26.445
We come down to a dark room.

870
00:48:26.528 --> 00:48:29.364
We bring some friends.
We have some drinks.

871
00:48:30.365 --> 00:48:32.909
Have some food. maybe. There's an opening.

872
00:48:32.993 --> 00:48:36.288
Someone comes on.
Opening act comes on. does ten minutes.

873
00:48:36.371 --> 00:48:38.915
Some fucking asshole comes on.
does over an hour.

874
00:48:39.625 --> 00:48:42.377
Right? Some jokes we laugh at.
some jokes we don't laugh at.

875
00:48:42.461 --> 00:48:45.714
Hopefully. overall we had a good time
and then we get the fuck out of here.

876
00:48:45.797 --> 00:48:49.551
That's comedy in America.
It's fun. It's easy. We get it.

877
00:48:49.635 --> 00:48:54.264
Comedy in the UK is very different.
Comedy in the UK is very serious.

878
00:48:54.348 --> 00:48:57.184
It's very serious.
They don't even call it comedy shows.

879
00:48:57.267 --> 00:48:59.227
They call it festival shows.

880
00:48:59.311 --> 00:49:02.648
"What's your festival show?
What's your one-man. one-woman show?

881
00:49:02.731 --> 00:49:05.651
You better make me laugh and then cry
and then laugh and then cry again.

882
00:49:05.734 --> 00:49:07.444
In the UK. we'll come watch you.

883
00:49:07.527 --> 00:49:11.990
and there's no food. no drinks.
no opening act. no friends.

884
00:49:13.659 --> 00:49:16.995
It's just you. For one hour.

885
00:49:17.079 --> 00:49:19.039
You better fucking do this.

886
00:49:19.122 --> 00:49:20.749
You better fucking do this. man.

887
00:49:20.832 --> 00:49:22.584
I paid for parking.
I paid for a babysitter.

888
00:49:22.668 --> 00:49:25.003
I paid for drinks. I paid for dinner.
and I paid for you.

889
00:49:25.087 --> 00:49:26.630
You better fucking do this."

890
00:49:27.255 --> 00:49:29.549
And people come angry to comedy.

891
00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:32.386
They're like. "Fuck you. Make me laugh."

892
00:49:33.595 --> 00:49:35.472
You're like.
"How was your day today. sir?"

893
00:49:35.555 --> 00:49:37.307
"Fuck you was how my day was."

894
00:49:38.642 --> 00:49:42.479
And they come and watch you
and people come and review you.

895
00:49:42.562 --> 00:49:46.191
People get paid
to come and review comedians

896
00:49:46.274 --> 00:49:50.028
and we give comedians stars.
like restaurants.

897
00:49:50.112 --> 00:49:54.616
Like Michelin stars. and we publish it
in the newspaper the next day.

898
00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:56.910
News of the land. Right?

899
00:49:56.993 --> 00:50:01.206
"Ronny Chieng--
Ronny Chieng was a two-star comedian.

900
00:50:01.289 --> 00:50:02.791
Two stars.

901
00:50:02.874 --> 00:50:05.335
Relied too much on his ethnic background.

902
00:50:05.419 --> 00:50:07.212
[laughter]

903
00:50:07.295 --> 00:50:11.591
Despite not doing a single joke
about Asian people. Two stars."

904
00:50:12.801 --> 00:50:17.472
Nish Kumar-- Nish Kumar has four stars.
Four stars to Nish Kumar.

905
00:50:17.556 --> 00:50:20.308
Jack Whitehall--
Jack Whitehall. five stars.

906
00:50:21.977 --> 00:50:23.353
Mr. Bean.

907
00:50:24.396 --> 00:50:27.357
Ten stars!

908
00:50:27.441 --> 00:50:32.738
Ten stars for the god of comedy. Mr. Bean.
who ended comedy. That night he ended it.

909
00:50:32.821 --> 00:50:35.866
He ended the game
when he did this bit about this…

910
00:50:35.949 --> 00:50:37.659
[babbles]

911
00:50:39.578 --> 00:50:41.455
He ended it. GOAT. The GOAT.

912
00:50:41.538 --> 00:50:43.457
GOAT being "greatest of all time."

913
00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:47.711
The GOAT.
The GOAT did six episodes of… [babbles]

914
00:50:47.794 --> 00:50:49.713
…30 years ago. the greatest. The greatest.

915
00:50:49.796 --> 00:50:52.174
With his ability
to cross cultures without words

916
00:50:52.257 --> 00:50:53.842
like a modern-day Charlie Chaplin.

917
00:50:53.925 --> 00:50:55.886
He's unparalleled in modern comedy.

918
00:50:55.969 --> 00:50:57.387
[laughter]

919
00:50:57.471 --> 00:50:58.805
[chuckles]

920
00:50:58.889 --> 00:51:02.976
All these fucking uneducated
Yelp. Twitter. reviewing bloggers

921
00:51:03.059 --> 00:51:06.480
giving their unsolicited.
unqualified opinion.

922
00:51:06.563 --> 00:51:11.276
The Internet has enabled
this goddamn amateur-hour culture

923
00:51:11.359 --> 00:51:14.529
of fucking dorks to thrive.

924
00:51:14.613 --> 00:51:17.574
People whose asshole opinion
we would never listen to

925
00:51:17.657 --> 00:51:20.243
in any professional setting.

926
00:51:20.327 --> 00:51:23.079
They start a Twitter or Yelp account

927
00:51:23.163 --> 00:51:26.500
and suddenly everybody is scrambling
to bow to their knowledge.

928
00:51:26.583 --> 00:51:29.085
It's gotten to a point
where you can flunk out of med school.

929
00:51:29.169 --> 00:51:32.506
the very next day. review doctors.
Doesn't make any sense.

930
00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:35.717
Everybody reviewing everything.
like they're experts.

931
00:51:35.801 --> 00:51:37.677
People reviewing comedy.

932
00:51:37.761 --> 00:51:42.474
Can you imagine that?
Who the fuck reviews comedy?

933
00:51:42.557 --> 00:51:45.018
Unironically. who reviews comedy?

934
00:51:45.101 --> 00:51:46.686
Who wakes up in the morning and goes.

935
00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:51.525
"Hey. you know what I'm going to do today
with my limited time on this planet?

936
00:51:52.567 --> 00:51:55.946
I'm going to take this thing
that was created with joy.

937
00:51:56.863 --> 00:51:59.324
intended to spread happiness.

938
00:51:59.407 --> 00:52:04.204
and then I'm gonna pick
as many flaws in it as I can.

939
00:52:04.287 --> 00:52:05.664
[babbles]

940
00:52:05.747 --> 00:52:08.291
'Cause I'm a fucking asshole.
That's my opinion."

941
00:52:08.375 --> 00:52:11.419
So everybody mining for outrage
to get angry at.

942
00:52:11.503 --> 00:52:13.922
put it on the Internet
with a sexy headline.

943
00:52:14.005 --> 00:52:17.217
hopefully get some clicks.
make a little bit of money.

944
00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:20.387
Because if you're looking for flaws.
you're going to find flaws.

945
00:52:21.221 --> 00:52:24.683
You know that. If you go into
any situation just looking for mistakes.

946
00:52:25.976 --> 00:52:28.395
guess what. you're going to find
some mistakes. right?

947
00:52:28.478 --> 00:52:32.941
Because nothing is perfect.
Nothing we do as humans is perfect.

948
00:52:33.024 --> 00:52:36.987
I'm sure I haven't been perfect tonight
for every single person.

949
00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:39.739
The wage gap joke
was probably a tactical error.

950
00:52:41.533 --> 00:52:43.326
I misjudged how blue the room was.

951
00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:44.411
[laughter]

952
00:52:44.494 --> 00:52:48.707
But whatever. you can find flaws
in anything if you look hard enough.

953
00:52:48.790 --> 00:52:52.919
You can find flaws in the Mona Lisa.
What does that mean?

954
00:52:54.671 --> 00:52:56.798
Also. what the fuck do you know about it?

955
00:52:56.882 --> 00:52:57.716
[laughter]

956
00:52:57.799 --> 00:53:01.636
Never been on stage in your life.
trying to tell me how to do my job.

957
00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:04.264
That's like me going
to a maternity ward in a hospital

958
00:53:04.347 --> 00:53:06.516
and giving women tips
on how to give birth.

959
00:53:07.392 --> 00:53:10.353
Yeah. what kind of fucking asshole
would go into a maternity ward

960
00:53:10.437 --> 00:53:12.397
and just look for women in labor?

961
00:53:14.691 --> 00:53:18.111
And just go. "Hey. you really should be
pushing harder during childbirth.

962
00:53:18.194 --> 00:53:22.365
You don't look like you're pushing
hard enough during childbirth.

963
00:53:22.449 --> 00:53:24.868
I think you're relying too much
on your ethnic background…

964
00:53:24.951 --> 00:53:26.369
[laughter]

965
00:53:26.453 --> 00:53:28.288
…during childbirth.

966
00:53:28.371 --> 00:53:32.250
Oh. the C-section? Oof.
That's a real lazy form of childbirth.

967
00:53:32.334 --> 00:53:34.210
[clicks tongue] Two stars."

968
00:53:37.464 --> 00:53:40.383
These fucking reviewing pieces of shit.

969
00:53:40.467 --> 00:53:43.094
trying to fool everyone into thinking
they know what they're talking about

970
00:53:43.178 --> 00:53:45.096
because they know how to use a keyboard.

971
00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:48.683
The amount of energy it takes
to create something

972
00:53:48.767 --> 00:53:51.144
versus the amount of energy
it takes to complain now.

973
00:53:51.227 --> 00:53:54.397
the Internet has totally disrupted
that process. right?

974
00:53:54.481 --> 00:53:57.233
Like. every morning.
people waking up. in this very room.

975
00:53:57.817 --> 00:54:00.195
Putting your necks on the line.
breaking your backs.

976
00:54:00.278 --> 00:54:03.281
trying to make something happen.
whatever your hustle is.

977
00:54:03.365 --> 00:54:05.492
whether you're trying to start a business.

978
00:54:05.575 --> 00:54:09.829
or organize your community
for positive political change.

979
00:54:09.913 --> 00:54:11.498
What a thankless task that is.

980
00:54:11.581 --> 00:54:13.583
Uh. open a restaurant.

981
00:54:13.667 --> 00:54:17.712
The risks involved with that.
Perfect your cooking as a chef.

982
00:54:17.796 --> 00:54:20.590
Train to be a pro athlete.
Make some music.

983
00:54:20.674 --> 00:54:23.677
Graphic design. Mine Bitcoin.

984
00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:28.932
Whatever your hustle is. every morning.
just make a little bit happen.

985
00:54:29.015 --> 00:54:31.434
You've gotta put everything you have.
all your energy.

986
00:54:31.518 --> 00:54:33.269
just to make a little bit happen.

987
00:54:33.353 --> 00:54:37.524
All it takes to criticize now
is this motion. This is all we need.

988
00:54:37.607 --> 00:54:38.942
[babbles]

989
00:54:39.025 --> 00:54:41.027
You don't even need your neck muscles.

990
00:54:41.111 --> 00:54:43.530
Before you're allowed to comment online.

991
00:54:43.613 --> 00:54:45.949
you should be made
to do something with your life.

992
00:54:46.032 --> 00:54:49.619
Go climb Mount Everest or something.
That should be the new captcha.

993
00:54:49.703 --> 00:54:52.038
"Are you human?
Did you climb Mount Everest?

994
00:54:52.122 --> 00:54:54.290
Okay. post a photo.
All right. you're good to go."

995
00:54:55.458 --> 00:54:59.629
Right? 'Cause how can you critique
without creating. is my point.

996
00:54:59.713 --> 00:55:03.883
How could you possibly have
perspective or goodwill

997
00:55:03.967 --> 00:55:06.219
when you enter into conversations. right?

998
00:55:06.302 --> 00:55:08.847
It's so easy to shit on things. man.
It's just so easy.

999
00:55:08.930 --> 00:55:11.933
Shitting on things is easy.
I do it professionally.

1000
00:55:12.851 --> 00:55:14.769
Super easy. [babbles]

1001
00:55:14.853 --> 00:55:18.356
It's much harder to build people up. man.
much harder to do stuff.

1002
00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:21.067
so we should be doing that
when we see someone else

1003
00:55:21.151 --> 00:55:25.030
doing something positive in the community.
something positive for themselves.

1004
00:55:25.113 --> 00:55:26.781
We should be encouraging to them more.

1005
00:55:26.865 --> 00:55:30.660
More than we're complaining
about other stuff. right?

1006
00:55:30.744 --> 00:55:33.538
You can only complain
as much as you help other people out.

1007
00:55:34.664 --> 00:55:38.668
Like. I was walking down West 4th Street
in Manhattan in New York City.

1008
00:55:39.502 --> 00:55:41.963
minding my own business.
not looking at my phone.

1009
00:55:42.047 --> 00:55:45.258
actually paying attention to the world
around me during the pandemic.

1010
00:55:45.341 --> 00:55:48.219
Just trying to get some fresh air.
Actually having a nice night.

1011
00:55:48.303 --> 00:55:53.349
I was walking down the street
in Manhattan. looking around.

1012
00:55:53.433 --> 00:55:55.935
and out of nowhere.
this woman walks right up to me.

1013
00:55:56.561 --> 00:55:59.606
grabs me on the throat
and just starts squeezing.

1014
00:55:59.689 --> 00:56:03.109
So I throw her off
and then she squares up.

1015
00:56:06.071 --> 00:56:09.699
And I look at her and I just walk away.

1016
00:56:11.367 --> 00:56:13.995
And that's. like.
a normal interaction in New York.

1017
00:56:16.956 --> 00:56:18.500
Neither of us said a word.

1018
00:56:19.542 --> 00:56:22.629
The entire time.
we didn't even make a sound.

1019
00:56:23.797 --> 00:56:28.051
We didn't review each other.
because we both knew what was going on.

1020
00:56:28.134 --> 00:56:30.220
We both knew
what that whole thing was about.

1021
00:56:30.845 --> 00:56:32.764
I looked at her and I was like.

1022
00:56:33.932 --> 00:56:37.727
"Oh. you're crazy.

1023
00:56:37.811 --> 00:56:41.231
Just like everyone on the Internet.
All right. See you later. crazy."

1024
00:56:42.023 --> 00:56:44.400
I didn't engage and I walked away.

1025
00:56:44.484 --> 00:56:46.402
And then she looked at me
and she was like.

1026
00:56:46.486 --> 00:56:50.156
"Oh. This is not a man who's going
to fight a woman on the street.

1027
00:56:51.032 --> 00:56:52.367
See you later. man."

1028
00:56:53.034 --> 00:56:57.080
And then we just went our separate ways.
And that was the end of it.

1029
00:56:59.374 --> 00:57:01.084
And I still respect that woman

1030
00:57:01.167 --> 00:57:04.838
more than these fucking
Twitter. Yelp. reviewing bloggers.

1031
00:57:07.257 --> 00:57:11.052
Because she was unhappy
about something in her life.

1032
00:57:11.136 --> 00:57:13.304
she got off her ass
and did something about it.

1033
00:57:13.388 --> 00:57:14.389
[laughter]

1034
00:57:14.472 --> 00:57:18.143
She didn't just sit behind her keyboard.
tweeting with her balls.

1035
00:57:18.226 --> 00:57:23.523
critiquing other people's creations
without making anything for themselves

1036
00:57:23.606 --> 00:57:26.609
like a bunch of parasites eating the host.

1037
00:57:26.693 --> 00:57:30.572
No. she didn't like Asian people.
She wanted to commit a hate crime.

1038
00:57:30.655 --> 00:57:32.699
[laughter]

1039
00:57:32.782 --> 00:57:34.284
And I can respect that.

1040
00:57:35.577 --> 00:57:37.287
That's proactive.

1041
00:57:38.079 --> 00:57:40.039
You guys have been awesome.
Thanks for listening.

1042
00:57:40.123 --> 00:57:43.293
I'll see you guys later.
Thanks. New York City. Thank you.

1043
