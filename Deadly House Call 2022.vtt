00:00:27.987 --> 00:00:29.695
(door closing)

5
00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:32.072
Hello. Ruth.

6
00:00:34.618 --> 00:00:37.486
Oh. You're not Irene.

7
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.039
I had an awful night
last night.

8
00:00:40.124 --> 00:00:43.992
My husband. I kept him up
until morning.

9
00:00:44.086 --> 00:00:47.171
I hate to do that.

10
00:00:47.298 --> 00:00:49.465
Warren has
his own troubles.

11
00:00:52.803 --> 00:00:55.220
Is this something new?

12
00:00:55.306 --> 00:00:56.680
Nurse:
That's right.

13
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.975
Irene didn't say anything.

14
00:01:00.061 --> 00:01:02.686
And you finally
found something

15
00:01:02.813 --> 00:01:04.313
that would help me
keep my food down.

16
00:01:04.398 --> 00:01:07.483
You would think this place
would improve the menu.

17
00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:10.235
considering my family
paid for this wing.

18
00:01:16.994 --> 00:01:18.577
I forget
what your name was.

19
00:01:21.332 --> 00:01:23.040
Wait. wait.

20
00:01:23.167 --> 00:01:26.210
- Wait. who are you?
- A friend. Ruth. An old friend.

21
00:01:26.337 --> 00:01:29.254
I don't feel very well.

22
00:01:30.674 --> 00:01:33.550
Uh-- uh-- I think
I'm having a reaction.

23
00:01:33.677 --> 00:01:36.011
I--
(whimpering)

24
00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:40.390
(long beeping)

25
00:01:56.534 --> 00:01:58.158
(soft chattering)

26
00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.129
Ms. Lockhart?

27
00:02:10.214 --> 00:02:14.299
Madison? I'm so sorry
to hear about your mother.

28
00:02:14.385 --> 00:02:15.759
She was a. uh--

29
00:02:15.886 --> 00:02:18.554
a formidable woman.

30
00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:19.972
Should I check
on your father?

31
00:02:21.892 --> 00:02:23.892
No. Gregory. I'll go.

32
00:02:23.978 --> 00:02:26.103
Hayley. honey. will you be okay
if I check on your grandpa?

33
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.604
Sure. Mom.

34
00:02:37.074 --> 00:02:38.323
How are you holding up.
Dad?

35
00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.534
She was so beautiful.
Madison.

36
00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:42.911
We were so happy together.

37
00:02:42.997 --> 00:02:45.664
Those summers
at the lake house

38
00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:48.542
were some of the best memories
I have.

39
00:02:48.627 --> 00:02:50.169
The best any kid would have.

40
00:02:50.254 --> 00:02:53.380
If I'd known
that last summer

41
00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:56.133
would be our final summer
together--

42
00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.303
I'm so sorry. Grandpa.

43
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.139
Thank you. Hayley.

44
00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:04.850
- Oh.
- God! Now look what I've done!

45
00:03:04.935 --> 00:03:06.560
It's okay. Dad. It's okay.

46
00:03:08.647 --> 00:03:10.731
I've got it. Don't worry.

47
00:03:10.816 --> 00:03:13.150
Thank you. Gregory. I don't know
what we'd do without you.

48
00:03:17.948 --> 00:03:20.148
Well. how's the caviar.
Emmett?

49
00:03:20.242 --> 00:03:21.742
It's from the Caspian.

50
00:03:21.827 --> 00:03:22.993
It was Ruth's favorite.

51
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.986
Is that what this is?

52
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.496
I thought it was raspberry jam
on a cracker.

53
00:03:26.624 --> 00:03:29.208
(chuckling)

54
00:03:29.293 --> 00:03:31.326
You know. I introduced
Warren and Ruth.

55
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.837
Not that I didn't have
my regrets afterwards.

56
00:03:33.964 --> 00:03:35.380
She was so stunning.

57
00:03:35.466 --> 00:03:39.343
I didn't have the courage
to ask her out myself.

58
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.221
Now. Warren. though.
he wasn't afraid of anything.

59
00:03:42.306 --> 00:03:44.389
Not back then.

60
00:03:44.475 --> 00:03:45.766
One of the bravest men
I've ever known.

61
00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:47.517
Agreed.

62
00:03:48.771 --> 00:03:49.895
How's Madison doing?

63
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.438
Well. you know Madison.

64
00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:54.349
No matter what's happening.

65
00:03:54.443 --> 00:03:55.692
she's as strong
as a Sherman tank.

66
00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.569
Did I hear my name?

67
00:03:57.655 --> 00:03:59.854
Yeah. baby.

68
00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:03.116
Hello. Madison. We were just
estimating your resistance

69
00:04:03.202 --> 00:04:05.035
to armor-piercing rounds.

70
00:04:05.162 --> 00:04:07.162
Hmm.

71
00:04:07.248 --> 00:04:10.699
I have to admit. I'm not feeling
so bullet-proof today.

72
00:04:10.793 --> 00:04:12.668
Aw. baby.

73
00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:14.378
Who was that
helping your father?

74
00:04:14.505 --> 00:04:16.713
Was it another cousin
I haven't met?

75
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.708
Oh. that's Gregory.
my dad's assistant.

76
00:04:19.802 --> 00:04:21.543
I didn't know
he had one.

77
00:04:21.637 --> 00:04:23.303
I arranged it
after my dad's last fall.

78
00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.390
I was worried my mom
was expending too much energy

79
00:04:26.517 --> 00:04:28.225
looking after him.

80
00:04:28.352 --> 00:04:31.061
(sighing) Madison. speaking
of unnecessary expenditures.

81
00:04:31.188 --> 00:04:33.605
we need to have a heart-to-heart
about the state of the firm.

82
00:04:33.691 --> 00:04:36.725
Arnold. you're like family
and I love you dearly.

83
00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:38.059
but now is not the time.

84
00:04:38.153 --> 00:04:40.404
- Excuse me.
- Okay. baby.

85
00:04:46.662 --> 00:04:52.916
â™ª

86
00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:55.002
I thought
I'd find you here.

87
00:04:55.087 --> 00:04:58.380
Nia. I thought you'd be stuck
in the office.

88
00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:01.416
Thank you.
You're a life saver.

89
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.636
- How you holding up?
- I'm okay.

90
00:05:04.722 --> 00:05:08.015
Actually.
I feel kinda numb.

91
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.643
I'd like to think
my mom and I were at peace.

92
00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:13.595
I don't wanna add
to your day.

93
00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:15.981
but Arnold's been after me
to arrange a meeting.

94
00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:17.899
Mm-hm.
Schedule it for Monday.

95
00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:19.484
Are you sure you don't need
some time off

96
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.403
to process all this?

97
00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:25.449
You mean cry.
let it all out?

98
00:05:25.576 --> 00:05:28.035
My father's gonna be all alone
in this great big house

99
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.828
for the first time
since forever.

100
00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:32.447
He needs a rock.
not a sponge.

101
00:05:32.541 --> 00:05:34.207
Sorry to interrupt.

102
00:05:34.293 --> 00:05:36.043
There's somebody here
to see you. Maddy.

103
00:05:36.128 --> 00:05:38.420
You and your dad.

104
00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:40.088
That's my cue.

105
00:05:42.843 --> 00:05:44.593
Come on.

106
00:05:50.934 --> 00:05:53.685
Hi. I'm Madison Lockhart.

107
00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:55.470
Are you here
for the reception?

108
00:05:55.564 --> 00:05:58.139
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean
to pull you away.

109
00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:00.609
I just wanted to drop by
and extend my condolences.

110
00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:02.736
Rebecca Wilson.

111
00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:05.447
- This is my husband Emmett.
- Emmett: Hi. nice to meet you.

112
00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:08.283
Thank you.
These are beautiful.

113
00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:12.204
I was. um.
one of Ruth's nurses.

114
00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:14.039
I like to think
that we were friends.

115
00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:15.490
Oh.

116
00:06:15.584 --> 00:06:17.667
- (glass shattering)
- Warren: Oh. God!

117
00:06:17.795 --> 00:06:19.836
Excuse me.
Do you mind holding that?

118
00:06:19.963 --> 00:06:21.380
Warren:
Not again!

119
00:06:23.467 --> 00:06:26.093
It was just an accident.
Here. I'll take that. Thank you.

120
00:06:27.346 --> 00:06:28.670
I am so sorry about this.

121
00:06:28.764 --> 00:06:30.263
We had a bit
of a misunderstanding

122
00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:32.224
with the catering crew.

123
00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:33.975
I told them
to get out of here.

124
00:06:34.061 --> 00:06:36.228
What the hell are all these
people doing in my house?

125
00:06:36.313 --> 00:06:39.514
Dad. these people are here
to pay their respects.

126
00:06:39.608 --> 00:06:41.516
They're here for Mom's wake.

127
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.693
Ruth?
What happened to Ruth?

128
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:48.031
Dad. Mom passed away
three days ago.

129
00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:49.524
Don't you remember?

130
00:06:49.618 --> 00:06:50.859
(wheezing)

131
00:06:50.953 --> 00:06:53.578
Dad. are you okay?
Are you okay. Dad?

132
00:06:53.664 --> 00:06:55.080
Can someone call an ambulance.
please?

133
00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:56.865
(coughing)

134
00:06:56.959 --> 00:06:59.668
Warren? Warren. my name is
Rebecca. okay? I'm a nurse.

135
00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:01.369
Listen to me. I know there's
a lot going on right now

136
00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:02.712
but I need you
to breathe with me.

137
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.048
Do you think
you can do that?

138
00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:06.550
One. two.

139
00:07:06.677 --> 00:07:08.885
- Okay. okay. good. In?
- (breathing slowing)

140
00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:11.221
--two. three.
Perfect. Now out.

141
00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:14.883
That's it! Very good. very good.
Just breathe.

142
00:07:14.977 --> 00:07:16.101
Everything's gonna be okay.

143
00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:19.229
Everything's
gonna be all right.

144
00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:21.940
(labored breathing)

145
00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:24.901
He's barely past
retirement age.

146
00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:27.696
He's only 67.

147
00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:30.449
He's had his memory issues
but I never--

148
00:07:30.534 --> 00:07:33.577
Early onset dementia?

149
00:07:33.704 --> 00:07:35.412
It's likely lain dormant.

150
00:07:35.539 --> 00:07:37.831
triggered by the stress
of the past few days.

151
00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:40.792
We need to run
a few more tests.

152
00:07:40.878 --> 00:07:42.335
So. what happens next?

153
00:07:42.421 --> 00:07:45.413
There's a rough timeline
we can expect to follow.

154
00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:48.592
His ability to make decisions
will continue to decline.

155
00:07:48.719 --> 00:07:51.511
Basic daily tasks
will become challenging

156
00:07:51.597 --> 00:07:54.422
and then almost impossible.

157
00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:57.392
Eventually he'll rely on others
completely for his care.

158
00:07:57.478 --> 00:08:00.020
You'll wanna start planning
before that time comes

159
00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:02.814
and arrange a transfer
of power of attorney.

160
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.816
All of this will only become
harder to implement

161
00:08:04.902 --> 00:08:06.443
the more time passes.

162
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.653
I'm truly very sorry.

163
00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:28.340
(sighing)
He's asleep for now.

164
00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:30.291
Gregory. you've done enough
for today.

165
00:08:30.385 --> 00:08:31.718
Thank you so much.

166
00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:34.462
It's almost 10:00.
You must be exhausted.

167
00:08:34.556 --> 00:08:36.640
It's no problem.
I'm happy to do it.

168
00:08:36.767 --> 00:08:40.060
Has anyone seen Hayley?

169
00:08:40.145 --> 00:08:41.811
(woman giggling)

170
00:08:44.775 --> 00:08:46.149
Oh.

171
00:08:48.946 --> 00:08:51.363
(giggling)

172
00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:54.866
Rebecca?
You're still here.

173
00:08:54.952 --> 00:08:57.202
I thought
we sent everyone home.

174
00:08:57.287 --> 00:09:00.497
I was uh. about to go and I saw
some caterers ducking out.

175
00:09:00.624 --> 00:09:02.490
There was still so much
left to clean.

176
00:09:02.584 --> 00:09:04.042
One dish led to another. and--

177
00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:06.044
Anyway. I should go.

178
00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:08.213
No. no. you don't have to go.
Rebecca.

179
00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:10.331
My mom's not being
very hospitable.

180
00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:13.843
Wait. Rebecca. I'm sorry.
It's just been a very long day.

181
00:09:13.971 --> 00:09:15.804
Thank you so much
for staying back and helping.

182
00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:18.598
Of course.
Oh! Uh. by the way.

183
00:09:18.684 --> 00:09:20.350
I fixed up
a late night snack.

184
00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:23.228
I figured by the time
you got back.

185
00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:24.604
you'd both be pretty starving.

186
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:26.514
Wow. Thank you.

187
00:09:26.608 --> 00:09:28.358
Wait. you're not staying
to try some?

188
00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:30.151
That took us
like two hours to make.

189
00:09:30.237 --> 00:09:32.612
Unfortunately I've got a big day
of job hunting tomorrow.

190
00:09:32.698 --> 00:09:35.198
You're not at the hospital
anymore?

191
00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:38.285
Sadly no. I was just filling in
for someone on maternity leave.

192
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.029
I'm really happy that Warren's
doing so much better.

193
00:09:41.123 --> 00:09:42.706
I left my phone number
in case you need anything.

194
00:09:42.833 --> 00:09:43.790
Anything at all.

195
00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:46.668
- Thank you.
- Of course.

196
00:09:49.673 --> 00:09:51.372
She's so cool. Mom.

197
00:09:51.466 --> 00:09:53.967
She's like Mary Poppins
without the accent.

198
00:09:58.015 --> 00:10:06.563
â™ª

199
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.607
Thought you were popping in
to gloat.

200
00:10:08.692 --> 00:10:11.392
I've been here six hours.

201
00:10:11.486 --> 00:10:13.153
You've barely been out
a month. Jesse.

202
00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:16.448
and you're already complaining
about having too much free time?

203
00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:18.566
I saw an opening.

204
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.327
I couldn't pass up the chance
to look around.

205
00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:24.289
So? You found it?

206
00:10:24.374 --> 00:10:26.240
No. Not yet.

207
00:10:26.335 --> 00:10:29.669
I'll need more time.
and opportunity.

208
00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:33.673
Bingo.

209
00:10:43.018 --> 00:10:46.427
Barely had a chance
to grieve for Mom. Emmett.

210
00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:47.979
Now this?

211
00:10:48.065 --> 00:10:51.316
Honey. I can stay with your dad
if he'll have me.

212
00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:53.101
Gregory can look after him
tomorrow during the day.

213
00:10:53.195 --> 00:10:54.986
Honey. I can't ask you
to do that.

214
00:10:55.072 --> 00:10:56.938
I know you're swamped
at the gallery.

215
00:10:57.032 --> 00:10:58.823
We don't know how long
it's gonna take

216
00:10:58.909 --> 00:11:00.450
to find him proper care.

217
00:11:00.577 --> 00:11:02.110
Warren:
I am not leaving this house.

218
00:11:02.204 --> 00:11:04.829
Dad. what are you doing up?

219
00:11:04.915 --> 00:11:06.447
I have Gregory.
He's more than enough.

220
00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:08.833
Dad. Gregory's
just a personal aide.

221
00:11:08.919 --> 00:11:10.785
He's not qualified to deal
with this kind of thing.

222
00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:13.088
I'm not getting placed
into a home.

223
00:11:16.593 --> 00:11:18.802
Of course not. Dad.

224
00:11:18.929 --> 00:11:21.012
I hear you.

225
00:11:21.098 --> 00:11:23.932
I'm listening.
We'll figure something out.

226
00:11:25.435 --> 00:11:27.769
I promise
you don't have to leave.

227
00:11:33.235 --> 00:11:35.944
Gregory. right?

228
00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:38.488
Rebecca?

229
00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:41.658
Hi! You come here too?

230
00:11:41.785 --> 00:11:44.318
After a day like today.
you bet I do.

231
00:11:44.413 --> 00:11:46.579
Two more
of what he's having?

232
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.333
So. how long
have you been working

233
00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.169
for the infamous
Lockhart family?

234
00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:55.964
Not long. Madison--
Ms. Lockhart--

235
00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:58.174
she just hired me
a few months ago.

236
00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:00.093
They've been good to me.

237
00:12:00.178 --> 00:12:02.837
Why do you call them
"infamous"?

238
00:12:02.931 --> 00:12:04.672
Oh. you know what they say.

239
00:12:04.766 --> 00:12:07.058
Behind every great fortune
is a crime.

240
00:12:07.144 --> 00:12:10.812
Oh. Where is that from? I feel
like I've heard it before.

241
00:12:15.152 --> 00:12:16.526
(coughing)

242
00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:21.448
How about you buy me
another one?

243
00:12:23.827 --> 00:12:25.243
Hey.

244
00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:32.250
Well. this is it.

245
00:12:48.643 --> 00:12:50.718
I've never done this before.

246
00:12:50.812 --> 00:12:52.479
(chuckling)

247
00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:04.491
There's a first time
for everything.

248
00:13:14.044 --> 00:13:15.919
Stop! What are you doing?

249
00:13:16.046 --> 00:13:20.298
You just received
a powerful dose of temazepam.

250
00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:23.968
You should be comatose or worse
in about 78 seconds.

251
00:13:24.054 --> 00:13:27.055
Don't worry.
It's completely undetectable.

252
00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:30.517
Your loved ones will just think
your heart popped.

253
00:13:30.602 --> 00:13:33.812
No one'll have to know
how much you suffered first--

254
00:13:33.897 --> 00:13:35.647
just you and me.

255
00:13:35.732 --> 00:13:38.099
Unless I inject you
with this.

256
00:13:38.193 --> 00:13:39.984
What-- what do you want?

257
00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:42.779
Tell me where Warren Lockhart's
files are.

258
00:13:42.906 --> 00:13:44.322
I know they're somewhere
in that house.

259
00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:47.116
In his study. in a locked
drawer. in a safe maybe?

260
00:13:47.244 --> 00:13:48.785
I-- I have no idea.

261
00:13:48.912 --> 00:13:51.287
Please. I'm just
a personal assistant!

262
00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:54.115
I don't know anything
about any safe!

263
00:13:54.209 --> 00:13:56.459
Oh. okay.

264
00:13:56.586 --> 00:14:00.288
I believe you. I do.

265
00:14:00.382 --> 00:14:04.175
It's just--
you're still in the way.

266
00:14:04.261 --> 00:14:05.635
You still need to go.

267
00:14:19.943 --> 00:14:29.826
â™ª

268
00:14:35.959 --> 00:14:45.842
â™ª

269
00:14:51.474 --> 00:14:52.891
Nia: Must feel strange
sitting in that chair.

270
00:14:52.976 --> 00:14:55.560
His chair.

271
00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:57.061
Madison: I wasn't sure
I ever wanted this.

272
00:14:57.147 --> 00:15:00.014
Taking over
the family business?

273
00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:04.319
I thought I was happy working
three doors down the hall.

274
00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:06.404
Well. if there's one lesson
I've learned

275
00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:08.489
after ten years of arranging
people's schedules.

276
00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:11.910
it's that life rarely
suits our timelines.

277
00:15:11.995 --> 00:15:13.161
Arnold's here.

278
00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:14.996
For that meeting?

279
00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:18.958
(sighing)
Bring him in. please.

280
00:15:21.338 --> 00:15:23.871
- She's ready.
- Thank you. Nia.

281
00:15:23.965 --> 00:15:25.373
Madison.

282
00:15:25.467 --> 00:15:27.375
How's Warren holding up?

283
00:15:27.469 --> 00:15:30.762
As best can be expected.
under the circumstances.

284
00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:33.431
He's angry.
he's frustrated.

285
00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:35.224
Quite frankly.
he's scared out of his wits.

286
00:15:35.352 --> 00:15:38.886
To see him reduced to this.

287
00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.606
You said it was urgent
that we speak.

288
00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:45.902
Before his retirement...

289
00:15:46.029 --> 00:15:50.490
Warren made a number of
bad investments. as you know.

290
00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:55.912
I have tried to stop
the bleeding as best I could.

291
00:15:56.039 --> 00:15:59.415
but... I think
we need to sell.

292
00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:01.542
(inhaling)

293
00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:10.510
My father bought this pen

294
00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:12.637
when he signed
his first contract.

295
00:16:12.722 --> 00:16:15.923
(unclear) pen is maybe the first
thing he bought for his job.

296
00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:17.767
He's used it to sign
every contract

297
00:16:17.894 --> 00:16:20.061
that's crossed his desk since.

298
00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:23.439
Now you're asking me to sign off
on ending his legacy.

299
00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:27.360
We faced this before.
We can push through again.

300
00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:34.158
Perhaps. But my advice as CFO
is to sell now.

301
00:16:34.244 --> 00:16:37.611
while the Lockhart family name
retains its value.

302
00:16:37.706 --> 00:16:40.289
Thank you. Arnold.
I'll take it under advisement.

303
00:16:40.417 --> 00:16:43.117
Madison. time is
of the essence.

304
00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:44.961
I just finished
burying my mother.

305
00:16:45.088 --> 00:16:47.621
Now you're asking me to sign
away my family birthright.

306
00:16:47.716 --> 00:16:49.465
I said I'll consider it.

307
00:16:56.975 --> 00:16:59.350
Listen to me.

308
00:16:59.436 --> 00:17:02.470
Warren has been my best friend
and my mentor for 35 years.

309
00:17:02.564 --> 00:17:07.025
I would never do anything
but protect him. and his family.

310
00:17:08.903 --> 00:17:10.611
The Lockhart legacy
is a lot more

311
00:17:10.697 --> 00:17:12.780
than a name
on a building to me.

312
00:17:12.866 --> 00:17:14.949
For all of us.

313
00:17:24.794 --> 00:17:27.170
What do you think?
Is he right?

314
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.424
I suppose it all depends
on what happens next.

315
00:17:31.509 --> 00:17:34.010
You mean it depends on me.

316
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.721
(phone notification dinging)

317
00:17:49.652 --> 00:17:51.685
- What is it? Is Dad okay?
- Your dad's fine.

318
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.739
He's in bed reading the paper.
It's just--

319
00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:56.657
Gregory didn't show up
this morning.

320
00:17:56.743 --> 00:17:59.744
Really?
He's been so dependable.

321
00:17:59.829 --> 00:18:01.245
Dad hasn't eaten yet?

322
00:18:01.331 --> 00:18:03.581
No.

323
00:18:03.666 --> 00:18:05.249
Thank you.
I'll take this up.

324
00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:13.424
Morning. Dad.

325
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:16.094
I brought you breakfast.

326
00:18:16.179 --> 00:18:17.378
How you feeling?

327
00:18:17.472 --> 00:18:20.640
Fine. fine.
Where's Gregory?

328
00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:22.058
He didn't show up.

329
00:18:22.185 --> 00:18:24.268
We've been calling him
all morning.

330
00:18:24.354 --> 00:18:26.887
Warren:
That doesn't sound like Gregory.

331
00:18:26.981 --> 00:18:29.690
Dad. there's something I wanted
to talk to you about.

332
00:18:29.776 --> 00:18:31.567
I spoke to Arnold
this morning.

333
00:18:31.694 --> 00:18:33.444
Let me guess.
He wants you to sell.

334
00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.613
That's exactly
what he said.

335
00:18:35.698 --> 00:18:37.565
I knew he was
up to something.

336
00:18:37.659 --> 00:18:39.909
Sell the company that my father
built from the ground up

337
00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:42.036
from nothing
but his two bare hands?

338
00:18:42.122 --> 00:18:44.247
Dad. Arnold's been
our family accountant

339
00:18:44.374 --> 00:18:45.873
since before I was born.

340
00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:47.750
He's always
looked out for us.

341
00:18:47.877 --> 00:18:50.837
If he truly thinks it's the
right decision to sell. then--

342
00:18:50.922 --> 00:18:54.006
That guy's stealing from me.
I can't find my watch.

343
00:18:54.092 --> 00:18:57.093
The one Ruth gave me
on our anniversary.

344
00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.387
Why would Arnold
steal your watch?

345
00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:07.436
Look.

346
00:19:07.564 --> 00:19:09.230
Here it is.
safe and sound.

347
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:13.601
(sighing)

348
00:19:13.695 --> 00:19:16.154
(phone ringing)

349
00:19:18.283 --> 00:19:20.741
Hello?
Madison Lockhart speaking.

350
00:19:22.537 --> 00:19:23.703
Okay.

351
00:19:23.788 --> 00:19:26.539
Oh. Okay.

352
00:19:28.418 --> 00:19:30.084
- Thank you.
- What is it?

353
00:19:31.421 --> 00:19:33.296
Who was that?

354
00:19:33.423 --> 00:19:36.090
Gregory won't be
coming in today.

355
00:19:36.176 --> 00:19:37.633
I'll see if Emmett
can take the day off.

356
00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.135
I don't want Emmett.

357
00:19:39.262 --> 00:19:41.929
I've got you. I've got Hayley.
I've got Ruth.

358
00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:43.306
Dad.

359
00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:45.641
Mom-- she's--

360
00:19:47.645 --> 00:19:49.854
You just eat.
I'll be downstairs.

361
00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:55.568
The police just called.

362
00:19:55.653 --> 00:19:59.322
Gregory was found unconscious
inside his apartment.

363
00:19:59.449 --> 00:20:01.315
They think
it was a drug overdose.

364
00:20:01.409 --> 00:20:03.993
He's in a medically
induced coma.

365
00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.162
An overdose?

366
00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:07.830
He didn't seem the type.

367
00:20:09.626 --> 00:20:12.168
I don't know how much longer
I can keep this up. Emmett.

368
00:20:12.295 --> 00:20:13.669
I can't keep breaking it to Dad
that Mom died.

369
00:20:13.796 --> 00:20:16.214
It's gut-wrenching.

370
00:20:16.299 --> 00:20:18.999
Dad thinks that Arnold's
stealing from him.

371
00:20:19.093 --> 00:20:20.551
Arnold?

372
00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:23.554
Is there any chance
you could look after Dad

373
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.765
for the rest of the day? I have
to get back to the office.

374
00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:27.841
Honey. you know how busy I am
with work right now.

375
00:20:27.936 --> 00:20:29.510
We need more than
a Band-Aid for this.

376
00:20:29.604 --> 00:20:31.145
We need to find
a long-term solution.

377
00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:32.688
What about Rebecca Wilson?

378
00:20:32.815 --> 00:20:35.349
She was great with Warren
the other day.

379
00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:38.686
We don't even know
if she's qualified.

380
00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.863
We're talking about
some specialized care here.

381
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.782
Would it hurt
to look at her resume?

382
00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:44.784
I don't know.

383
00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:46.035
She's still a stranger.

384
00:20:46.162 --> 00:20:48.696
Honey. I like her.

385
00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:52.124
Hayley likes her.
your dad likes her.

386
00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:56.045
Besides...she knew your mom.

387
00:21:09.644 --> 00:21:11.477
Where the hell
did they hide you?

388
00:21:11.562 --> 00:21:13.813
(phone buzzing)

389
00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:18.567
Hello?
Rebecca Wilson speaking.

390
00:21:18.695 --> 00:21:20.736
Hi. Rebecca.
It's Madison Lockhart.

391
00:21:20.863 --> 00:21:22.488
Do you have a minute?

392
00:21:22.573 --> 00:21:24.398
Of course. Madison.
Is everything all right?

393
00:21:24.492 --> 00:21:25.700
How's Warren doing?

394
00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:27.568
To be honest. not so well.

395
00:21:27.662 --> 00:21:29.245
I was hoping
you might have some time

396
00:21:29.372 --> 00:21:31.914
to come by the house tomorrow
to discuss a job proposal?

397
00:21:32.041 --> 00:21:34.333
I'd be happy to. Madison.

398
00:21:34.419 --> 00:21:36.076
How's 7:30AM?

399
00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:37.795
That sounds great.

400
00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.839
Thanks. Rebecca.
We'll see you tomorrow.

401
00:21:49.309 --> 00:21:50.924
It's all coming together.
Jesse.

402
00:21:51.019 --> 00:21:53.436
We're finally getting back
what's ours.

403
00:22:15.793 --> 00:22:18.627
Madison: So. how do you see
this all working. Rebecca?

404
00:22:18.755 --> 00:22:20.046
I'm gonna have to rely
on your expertise.

405
00:22:20.131 --> 00:22:22.506
Of course.
Well. first and foremost.

406
00:22:22.592 --> 00:22:24.550
I'll act as point person
between you. Warren.

407
00:22:24.635 --> 00:22:25.793
and the hospital.

408
00:22:25.887 --> 00:22:27.803
So. tracking
all of his progress.

409
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:29.463
sharing that
with his doctors.

410
00:22:29.557 --> 00:22:31.223
taking him to all
of his appointments.

411
00:22:31.309 --> 00:22:33.684
Really just sparing you
all that shop talk.

412
00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:35.469
Madison:
And what about meals?

413
00:22:35.563 --> 00:22:38.189
Ah. nutrition is
of vital importance.

414
00:22:38.274 --> 00:22:40.274
I took the liberty of developing
a daily meal plan

415
00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.651
based on Warren's age.
height. and weight.

416
00:22:42.779 --> 00:22:46.280
A healthy diet. regular
exercise. and mental stimulation

417
00:22:46.366 --> 00:22:49.200
is key to slowing down
any sort of cognitive decline.

418
00:22:49.285 --> 00:22:51.535
And of course. a walk
in the park every now and then

419
00:22:51.621 --> 00:22:53.204
doesn't hurt either.

420
00:22:53.289 --> 00:22:55.706
Great! This all looks terrific.

421
00:22:55.792 --> 00:22:57.375
I'm gonna verify
the references

422
00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.710
and hopefully you can get
started in a few days.

423
00:22:59.796 --> 00:23:01.253
(phone ringing)

424
00:23:01.339 --> 00:23:03.255
Um. excuse me.

425
00:23:07.929 --> 00:23:10.471
Mm-hm?

426
00:23:10.556 --> 00:23:12.014
Okay.

427
00:23:13.476 --> 00:23:16.727
That was work. I have to
get back to the office.

428
00:23:18.356 --> 00:23:22.733
Oh. But I told Emmett I would
take care of Dad today.

429
00:23:22.819 --> 00:23:24.944
Oh. Well. uh. this might
seem impetuous.

430
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:26.612
but given the circumstances.

431
00:23:26.697 --> 00:23:29.490
I'd be more than happy
to start now. if it'd help.

432
00:23:29.575 --> 00:23:32.576
Thank you. Yes.

433
00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:38.198
I left instructions on how
to reach me in an emergency.

434
00:23:38.292 --> 00:23:40.033
but I'll have my phone on me
all day.

435
00:23:40.128 --> 00:23:41.627
And the keys are by the door.

436
00:23:41.712 --> 00:23:44.755
My dad's meds are in the cabinet
in the master bedroom.

437
00:23:44.841 --> 00:23:47.049
He takes them
after every meal.

438
00:23:47.176 --> 00:23:48.717
but I've already given him
his morning pills.

439
00:23:48.845 --> 00:23:50.428
They tend to make him
a little sleepy.

440
00:23:50.513 --> 00:23:52.221
so he's just been going
back to bed.

441
00:23:52.348 --> 00:23:54.181
Madison. you have nothing
to worry about.

442
00:23:54.267 --> 00:23:56.884
Warren and I
will be just fine.

443
00:23:56.978 --> 00:23:58.602
I'm so sorry.
but I really have to get going.

444
00:23:58.688 --> 00:24:00.938
Oh yeah. no. go.
Go to work.

445
00:24:01.023 --> 00:24:03.065
That investment firm's not gonna
run itself. right?

446
00:24:03.192 --> 00:24:04.400
(car lock chirping)

447
00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:24.420
â™ª

448
00:24:51.073 --> 00:24:58.412
â™ª

449
00:25:16.891 --> 00:25:24.638
â™ª

450
00:25:24.732 --> 00:25:28.025
Ruth? Is that you?

451
00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:30.194
Hello. Warren.
It's Rebecca!

452
00:25:30.279 --> 00:25:31.862
We met the other day?

453
00:25:31.948 --> 00:25:34.490
Your family hired me
just to help out around here.

454
00:25:34.617 --> 00:25:37.150
I thought for a second
you were Ruth.

455
00:25:37.245 --> 00:25:39.453
You have
the same hairstyle.

456
00:25:39.539 --> 00:25:41.038
What are you doing
in my room?

457
00:25:41.123 --> 00:25:43.666
Oh. I thought
you were still sleeping.

458
00:25:43.793 --> 00:25:46.502
I was just looking around
for some slippers for you

459
00:25:46.629 --> 00:25:47.711
and trying to be quiet.

460
00:25:47.797 --> 00:25:49.329
Where's Madison?
Where's Gregory?

461
00:25:49.423 --> 00:25:52.716
These are all very good
questions. Warren.

462
00:25:52.802 --> 00:25:55.511
but before I can give you
some very good answers.

463
00:25:55.638 --> 00:25:57.346
you just need
to take your pills.

464
00:25:57.473 --> 00:25:59.673
Warren:
I don't want these.

465
00:25:59.767 --> 00:26:01.016
They make me feel loopy.

466
00:26:01.143 --> 00:26:03.561
I used to be in the office
by 5:00AM.

467
00:26:03.646 --> 00:26:07.898
Now look at me-- trapped in bed
like a depressed teenager.

468
00:26:09.443 --> 00:26:13.028
Warren. don't forget
what your doctor said.

469
00:26:13.155 --> 00:26:15.364
I'm only here
to execute his orders.

470
00:26:15.491 --> 00:26:17.283
and your family's wishes.

471
00:26:17.368 --> 00:26:21.287
He said I'm a grown man who can
make his own damn decisions!

472
00:26:25.042 --> 00:26:28.377
I know exactly who you are.
Warren Lockhart.

473
00:26:28.504 --> 00:26:31.204
I know exactly
what you've accomplished.

474
00:26:31.299 --> 00:26:32.423
We'll work through this
together.

475
00:26:32.508 --> 00:26:34.592
with due respect and dignity.

476
00:26:36.721 --> 00:26:39.388
Now. please take your pills?

477
00:26:41.392 --> 00:26:43.726
They give me
such awful dreams.

478
00:26:44.854 --> 00:26:47.438
Dreams of Ruth?

479
00:26:47.523 --> 00:26:50.649
I'm so sorry. Warren.

480
00:26:50.735 --> 00:26:53.393
What you've gone through
the last few days.

481
00:26:53.487 --> 00:26:54.987
having to suffer all alone.

482
00:26:55.072 --> 00:26:59.199
I'm not alone.
I have Madison and Hayley.

483
00:26:59.285 --> 00:27:01.285
That's right. Your family.

484
00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:04.571
What matters most. Warren.
is that I'm here now.

485
00:27:04.665 --> 00:27:06.406
And I'm not going anywhere.

486
00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:07.625
You're stuck with me. Sir.

487
00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:09.668
come hell or high water.

488
00:27:18.512 --> 00:27:20.304
Thank you. Warren.

489
00:27:22.558 --> 00:27:24.308
Now. what would you
like to do today?

490
00:27:24.393 --> 00:27:26.810
It is our first date.
after all.

491
00:27:26.896 --> 00:27:30.064
Ruth and I. we used to go
for a walk in the park

492
00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:31.565
on a sunny day like this.

493
00:27:31.651 --> 00:27:33.651
That sounds like
a wonderful idea.

494
00:27:33.736 --> 00:27:35.194
I'll pack us a picnic.

495
00:27:36.572 --> 00:27:39.940
Now. where did I put
that damn watch?

496
00:27:40.034 --> 00:27:43.869
I swear I left it here
last night.

497
00:27:43.954 --> 00:27:45.788
I just keep losing things.

498
00:27:45.915 --> 00:27:49.041
Rebecca: It's okay. Warren!
It's okay. I'll tell you what.

499
00:27:49.126 --> 00:27:51.293
We can devote our entire day
to searching this house

500
00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:52.920
until we find
that watch of yours.

501
00:27:53.005 --> 00:27:56.623
I can't ask you to waste
your whole day over a watch!

502
00:27:56.717 --> 00:27:58.291
It's my pleasure.

503
00:27:58.386 --> 00:28:01.178
They don't call it
a search "party" for nothing.

504
00:28:02.765 --> 00:28:04.765
I'll start downstairs
and you start right here?

505
00:28:06.644 --> 00:28:08.018
Yeah.

506
00:28:12.775 --> 00:28:20.489
â™ª

507
00:28:35.798 --> 00:28:37.798
Ah. where could it be?

508
00:29:16.338 --> 00:29:21.341
â™ª

509
00:29:21.427 --> 00:29:22.885
Rebecca?

510
00:29:25.431 --> 00:29:27.264
I forgot what we're supposed
to be doing.

511
00:29:27.349 --> 00:29:28.766
Oh. we're looking
for your watch.

512
00:29:28.851 --> 00:29:29.767
Did you have any luck?

513
00:29:29.852 --> 00:29:31.101
It was a gift from Ruth.

514
00:29:31.187 --> 00:29:33.896
We'll find it.
Don't you worry.

515
00:29:34.023 --> 00:29:35.355
I'm feeling pretty tired.

516
00:29:35.441 --> 00:29:37.775
I think maybe I should
sit down for a bit.

517
00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:40.068
That's okay. No problem.

518
00:29:55.377 --> 00:29:57.419
Thank you very much
for helping me look.

519
00:29:57.546 --> 00:29:58.745
(coughing)

520
00:29:58.839 --> 00:30:00.964
I never imagined
it would take all day.

521
00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:02.508
I understand. Warren.

522
00:30:02.593 --> 00:30:05.135
I'm not done yet.
I promised you I'd find it.

523
00:30:15.397 --> 00:30:24.196
â™ª

524
00:30:33.582 --> 00:30:36.375
Well hello. gorgeous.

525
00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:37.835
(car approaching outside)

526
00:30:48.264 --> 00:30:51.131
Oh my God.
oh my God. oh my God.

527
00:30:51.225 --> 00:30:52.808
Oh. no.

528
00:31:14.456 --> 00:31:15.488
Hayley?

529
00:31:15.583 --> 00:31:18.158
- Rebecca.
- Are you okay?

530
00:31:18.252 --> 00:31:20.660
Oh. God.
I thought you were my mom.

531
00:31:20.754 --> 00:31:25.340
- She's gonna kill me.
- Tell me what happened.

532
00:31:25.467 --> 00:31:28.501
Some friends
threw a party after school

533
00:31:28.596 --> 00:31:30.003
and we needed a way
to get there.

534
00:31:30.097 --> 00:31:32.723
so I borrowed Grandpa's car.

535
00:31:32.808 --> 00:31:37.185
and Penelope had
this punch. and--

536
00:31:37.313 --> 00:31:38.770
I felt woozy driving home

537
00:31:38.856 --> 00:31:42.515
and I tried to park it back
and the steering locked.

538
00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:44.902
And Mom's gonna
totally disown me.

539
00:31:44.987 --> 00:31:46.737
Hayley. I've got this.

540
00:31:46.822 --> 00:31:49.406
Gimme the keys and meet me
back inside.

541
00:31:49.491 --> 00:31:52.701
But how? That guy over there
saw the whole thing.

542
00:31:55.372 --> 00:31:57.331
Wait here.
I'll be right back.

543
00:32:00.502 --> 00:32:07.466
â™ª

544
00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:17.476
- What did you say to him?
- (sighing)

545
00:32:17.561 --> 00:32:21.438
Hayley. You are a Lockhart.

546
00:32:21.523 --> 00:32:24.107
You might not know it now.

547
00:32:24.193 --> 00:32:26.693
but that name holds power
in this world.

548
00:32:26.779 --> 00:32:28.111
It's currency.

549
00:32:28.197 --> 00:32:29.396
It's a big. flashing sign

550
00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:31.239
telling people.
"Money lives here.

551
00:32:31.367 --> 00:32:32.991
"Mess with it at your peril."

552
00:32:33.077 --> 00:32:37.120
It makes ordinary guys like him
think twice about paperwork.

553
00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:40.374
I don't know
how to thank you.

554
00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:45.462
No need to thank me.
You owe me.

555
00:32:45.547 --> 00:32:47.381
Now let's get you inside
so you can sleep this off?

556
00:32:47.466 --> 00:32:48.966
Yeah.

557
00:33:02.856 --> 00:33:04.147
(car locks chirping outside)

558
00:33:19.081 --> 00:33:20.447
- Hi. Rebecca.
- Hi.

559
00:33:20.541 --> 00:33:22.541
Sorry I'm running so late.

560
00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:27.796
Did something happen here?

561
00:33:27.923 --> 00:33:29.622
Rebecca:
Oh. (nervous chuckling)

562
00:33:29.717 --> 00:33:32.551
There was a bit of a distraction
concerning a certain watch.

563
00:33:32.636 --> 00:33:34.511
We kinda turned the place
upside-down looking for it.

564
00:33:34.596 --> 00:33:38.807
Warren insisted
we search everywhere.

565
00:33:38.934 --> 00:33:40.967
My dad did all this?

566
00:33:41.061 --> 00:33:43.603
Yeah. It's a symptom
of the disease.

567
00:33:43.689 --> 00:33:46.023
Sadly.

568
00:33:46.108 --> 00:33:48.141
An irrational attachment
to misplaced valuables.

569
00:33:48.235 --> 00:33:50.444
But the good news is
he's a lot calmer now.

570
00:33:50.529 --> 00:33:52.029
Well. that's good.
Where is he?

571
00:33:52.114 --> 00:33:54.147
Oh. he's just resting upstairs.

572
00:33:54.241 --> 00:33:56.533
You know. we had quite
an active day. to say the least.

573
00:33:56.618 --> 00:34:00.653
Thank you. Rebecca. for stepping
in on such last-minute notice.

574
00:34:00.748 --> 00:34:03.707
Oh yeah. of course!
It's my pleasure.

575
00:34:03.792 --> 00:34:05.492
There is one other
little item.

576
00:34:05.586 --> 00:34:08.328
Warren asked me
to move his car

577
00:34:08.422 --> 00:34:10.881
and I sort of grazed
the lamp post by accident

578
00:34:10.966 --> 00:34:13.500
and it did manage to roll
a bit of a ways

579
00:34:13.594 --> 00:34:15.335
down the driveway
before I was able to stop it.

580
00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:17.220
I'm sorry. I promise
I'll be more careful.

581
00:34:17.306 --> 00:34:21.841
So. that's what happened
out front.

582
00:34:21.935 --> 00:34:23.769
You sure you're not
covering for him?

583
00:34:23.854 --> 00:34:26.021
It wouldn't be the first time
he's tried taking out the car

584
00:34:26.148 --> 00:34:27.773
since his license
was suspended.

585
00:34:27.858 --> 00:34:32.069
(chuckling) I assure you.
your father was well behaved.

586
00:34:32.154 --> 00:34:35.197
Warren is a lovely.
playful man.

587
00:34:35.324 --> 00:34:39.701
I don't think that's exactly
how I'd describe my father.

588
00:34:39.828 --> 00:34:42.862
Heh. Also.
your daughter Hayley is here.

589
00:34:42.956 --> 00:34:45.791
It seems she left school early
complaining about a flu.

590
00:34:45.876 --> 00:34:47.459
So. I made her a cup of soup

591
00:34:47.544 --> 00:34:48.919
and I tucked her into bed
in the guest room.

592
00:34:49.004 --> 00:34:50.670
Oh. I'll go and check.

593
00:34:50.756 --> 00:34:53.048
Oh. no. I'm sure she's just
sleeping it off.

594
00:34:53.175 --> 00:34:54.925
What about you? Were you able
to put out that office fire?

595
00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:59.045
Oh. I don't know
about it being a fire.

596
00:34:59.139 --> 00:35:02.516
It's more like the water level
rising to fill the room.

597
00:35:04.353 --> 00:35:06.311
Well. I was just about
to start cleaning. so.

598
00:35:10.818 --> 00:35:12.943
Warren:
Is that you down there. Madison?

599
00:35:16.031 --> 00:35:18.281
Madison:
Dad. How was your day?

600
00:35:29.753 --> 00:35:32.170
- Hey. honey.
- Oh.

601
00:35:32.256 --> 00:35:34.914
Emmett. when you checked
Rebecca's references.

602
00:35:35.008 --> 00:35:37.417
nothing came up. right?
No red flags?

603
00:35:37.511 --> 00:35:39.261
I called every number
she listed.

604
00:35:39.388 --> 00:35:41.304
The ones I got through to
all had glowing reviews.

605
00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:43.515
You still worried
about this?

606
00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.059
I thought
she's been a godsend.

607
00:35:46.145 --> 00:35:48.395
She has. and you're right.

608
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.772
It just isn't sitting well
with me. I guess.

609
00:35:50.899 --> 00:35:53.316
Giving someone this much access
to our family.

610
00:35:53.402 --> 00:35:56.945
Honey. We can't control
everything.

611
00:35:57.072 --> 00:35:59.072
We certainly can't control
what's happening to your father.

612
00:35:59.158 --> 00:36:02.367
We're all gonna have to learn
to let go a little.

613
00:36:02.452 --> 00:36:04.369
All the same. it doesn't hurt
to double check.

614
00:36:05.956 --> 00:36:07.289
Is Hayley home?

615
00:36:07.416 --> 00:36:09.875
She's in bed.
She wasn't feeling well.

616
00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:12.210
Oh. I'll go check on her.

617
00:36:23.056 --> 00:36:24.464
(phone ringing internally)

618
00:36:24.558 --> 00:36:26.799
Man: Strathmere Retirement Home.
This is Steve.

619
00:36:26.894 --> 00:36:28.968
Yes. hi.
My name's Madison Lockhart.

620
00:36:29.062 --> 00:36:31.688
I'm calling about
a former staff member of yours.

621
00:36:31.773 --> 00:36:33.640
Rebecca Wilson.

622
00:36:33.734 --> 00:36:35.400
I'm looking for information
about what kind of role

623
00:36:35.485 --> 00:36:37.277
she played at your facility.

624
00:36:37.362 --> 00:36:40.113
Steve: I'm sorry. Is Ms. Wilson
not meeting your expectations?

625
00:36:40.199 --> 00:36:42.908
I think I might have spoken with
another member of your family--

626
00:36:42.993 --> 00:36:44.367
Emmett. was it?

627
00:36:44.453 --> 00:36:46.828
Uh. that's right.
I'm just following up.

628
00:36:46.955 --> 00:36:50.707
I'd like to know a little bit
more about Rebecca. if possible.

629
00:36:50.792 --> 00:36:53.501
I'm sure you understand.

630
00:36:53.629 --> 00:36:55.795
What were her reasons
for leaving. for instance?

631
00:36:55.881 --> 00:36:58.423
Were there any complaints
made against her?

632
00:36:58.508 --> 00:37:00.050
Unfortunately.
I'm not at liberty

633
00:37:00.135 --> 00:37:01.843
to give out that kind
of information.

634
00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:04.804
But I can assure you Ms. Wilson
left on glowing terms.

635
00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:07.098
We were sad to see her go.

636
00:37:07.184 --> 00:37:09.684
Madison:
Okay. Thanks for your help.

637
00:37:09.811 --> 00:37:12.437
No problem whatsoever. You
have yourself a nice evening.

638
00:37:20.781 --> 00:37:22.781
She's getting antsy.

639
00:37:22.866 --> 00:37:25.191
You're not as good
as you think you are.

640
00:37:25.285 --> 00:37:27.035
She's just having
a moment of doubt.

641
00:37:27.162 --> 00:37:30.247
She'll stop at one and feel
it's enough. Trust me.

642
00:37:30.332 --> 00:37:31.623
If another one
of those phones rings.

643
00:37:31.708 --> 00:37:33.366
then we might
have a problem.

644
00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:36.544
All this sneaking around.
All these games.

645
00:37:36.672 --> 00:37:38.296
What's the point?!

646
00:37:38.382 --> 00:37:41.341
When I could just
go shoot him in the head?

647
00:37:41.426 --> 00:37:44.094
First he needs to suffer.

648
00:37:44.179 --> 00:37:46.972
First they need to know what
it's like to lose everything.

649
00:37:48.308 --> 00:37:50.684
Don't you ever doubt me.
little brother.

650
00:37:52.646 --> 00:37:55.605
Don't you ever forget who
took care of you. who fed you.

651
00:37:55.691 --> 00:37:59.401
who protected you when
Mom and Dad weren't there.

652
00:37:59.528 --> 00:38:02.487
- Don't you ever.
- Okay.

653
00:38:02.572 --> 00:38:04.572
We do it your way.

654
00:38:06.034 --> 00:38:08.618
What did I tell you?
She stopped at one.

655
00:38:11.832 --> 00:38:12.789
So. now that you found it.

656
00:38:12.874 --> 00:38:15.575
how do we get inside it?

657
00:38:15.669 --> 00:38:18.378
We don't. Not unless you know
how to crack

658
00:38:18.463 --> 00:38:21.589
an Omniguard EL90 fireproof.
tamper-proof

659
00:38:21.717 --> 00:38:23.591
home security vault.

660
00:38:23.719 --> 00:38:25.510
If we want in.
we need the combination.

661
00:38:25.595 --> 00:38:27.587
The old man
won't just tell us.

662
00:38:27.681 --> 00:38:29.973
Not unless I find the
right way to ask him.

663
00:38:30.058 --> 00:38:33.268
Warren Lockhart
needs to have an accident.

664
00:38:45.198 --> 00:38:48.408
- Beautiful day. isn't it?
- Hm. certainly is.

665
00:38:48.493 --> 00:38:50.610
I'm sorry we didn't
get to do this sooner.

666
00:38:50.704 --> 00:38:51.995
You're already looking better.
handsome.

667
00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.330
getting out
of that stuffy old house.

668
00:38:53.415 --> 00:38:56.124
Mm. all right.
Lead the way.

669
00:38:56.251 --> 00:38:59.085
First. we hydrate.

670
00:38:59.171 --> 00:39:01.788
And you need
to take your pills.

671
00:39:01.882 --> 00:39:04.123
Didn't I already take these?

672
00:39:04.217 --> 00:39:08.094
Trust me. Warren.
your organizer doesn't lie.

673
00:39:11.641 --> 00:39:13.892
Ruth would've loved it here.

674
00:39:13.977 --> 00:39:17.020
She was such a fan
of the outdoors.

675
00:39:17.105 --> 00:39:18.471
Is that why you bought
the lake house?

676
00:39:18.565 --> 00:39:20.023
The one in the photos?

677
00:39:20.108 --> 00:39:24.486
Ruth. she used to say...

678
00:39:24.613 --> 00:39:26.696
What did Ruth use to say?

679
00:39:29.451 --> 00:39:30.825
She would've loved it here.

680
00:39:30.952 --> 00:39:34.320
She was a big fan
of the outdoors.

681
00:39:34.414 --> 00:39:35.872
Tell me more about Ruth.

682
00:39:38.752 --> 00:39:42.796
What time is it. Rebecca?
I've lost track.

683
00:39:42.881 --> 00:39:44.047
I thought
we could stop up ahead.

684
00:39:44.132 --> 00:39:45.340
I hear there's
quite a lookout.

685
00:39:45.467 --> 00:39:47.675
Are you up for that?

686
00:39:47.803 --> 00:39:50.553
Rebecca. I think
these new pills--

687
00:39:50.639 --> 00:39:52.055
they're affecting
my vertigo.

688
00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:54.933
Come on. Warren.
A big. strong buck like you?

689
00:39:55.018 --> 00:39:56.351
You can do it!

690
00:39:56.478 --> 00:39:57.852
(breathing heavily)

691
00:40:07.197 --> 00:40:09.239
Hello?

692
00:40:09.324 --> 00:40:12.191
Hello? Ruth?

693
00:40:12.285 --> 00:40:13.618
Ruth?

694
00:40:13.703 --> 00:40:14.702
- (twig cracking)
- Ah!

695
00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:16.246
(thudding)

696
00:40:19.793 --> 00:40:20.875
I spoke with Gertie in Berlin.

697
00:40:21.002 --> 00:40:22.535
They're amenable
to the loan

698
00:40:22.629 --> 00:40:25.255
but the terms aren't exactly
what we call favorable.

699
00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:27.215
It leaves us in quite the spot
for the foreseeable future.

700
00:40:27.342 --> 00:40:28.925
It leaves us vulnerable.

701
00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:31.678
The question is.
is it worth it

702
00:40:31.763 --> 00:40:34.305
or do we simply
cut the losses?

703
00:40:36.643 --> 00:40:37.934
Is something on your mind?

704
00:40:38.019 --> 00:40:40.145
We're only talking
about the survivability

705
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:42.397
of your family legacy here.

706
00:40:43.525 --> 00:40:45.108
You met her. right?

707
00:40:45.193 --> 00:40:47.235
My father's new caregiver.
Rebecca Wilson?

708
00:40:47.362 --> 00:40:51.230
Uh. briefly.
at your mother's wake.

709
00:40:51.324 --> 00:40:54.325
You've always been good
at reading people.

710
00:40:54.411 --> 00:40:55.827
You're having misgivings?

711
00:40:55.912 --> 00:40:59.205
Something just feels off.

712
00:40:59.291 --> 00:41:01.207
Do you wanna know
what I think?

713
00:41:02.377 --> 00:41:04.043
Always.

714
00:41:04.129 --> 00:41:05.745
I think
you're feeling guilty

715
00:41:05.839 --> 00:41:08.381
for not taking care
of your father yourself.

716
00:41:08.467 --> 00:41:11.259
protecting him
like a good daughter should.

717
00:41:11.386 --> 00:41:13.094
So you're projecting
that blame onto Rebecca--

718
00:41:13.221 --> 00:41:17.140
seeing fault. seeing conspiracy.

719
00:41:17.225 --> 00:41:18.850
where plainly
there is none.

720
00:41:19.895 --> 00:41:21.311
Maybe you're right.

721
00:41:21.396 --> 00:41:22.896
I think I just needed
to hear a second opinion.

722
00:41:22.981 --> 00:41:25.523
I'm your friend.
This is what I do.

723
00:41:25.609 --> 00:41:29.486
Among 10.000 other things.

724
00:41:29.571 --> 00:41:31.863
Now. do we accept
that offer from Berlin

725
00:41:31.948 --> 00:41:34.240
or do we listen to Arnold?

726
00:41:38.079 --> 00:41:41.247
I always knew that some day
I'd be sitting in this chair.

727
00:41:41.333 --> 00:41:44.209
Making decisions
with other people's money.

728
00:41:44.294 --> 00:41:45.919
Now that I'm here.

729
00:41:46.004 --> 00:41:47.545
I can't fathom the thought
of letting it go.

730
00:41:47.631 --> 00:41:49.789
(phone ringing)

731
00:41:49.883 --> 00:41:51.883
It's Rebecca.
I have to take this.

732
00:41:53.303 --> 00:41:55.595
Rebecca. hi.
Is everything all right?

733
00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.630
Rebecca: Madison.
I don't want you to panic.

734
00:41:57.724 --> 00:41:59.182
Your dad is going to be
just fine.

735
00:41:59.267 --> 00:42:01.017
My dad? What happened?

736
00:42:01.102 --> 00:42:04.729
Rebecca: He had a fall. We're
on our way to the hospital.

737
00:42:04.814 --> 00:42:07.524
- I have to go.
- Yeah. go. go!

738
00:42:16.117 --> 00:42:17.483
Dad?

739
00:42:17.577 --> 00:42:20.370
Oh my God. Are you all right?
What happened?

740
00:42:20.455 --> 00:42:22.747
We were walking
on his favorite trail

741
00:42:22.832 --> 00:42:24.541
and he must've tripped
on a root?

742
00:42:24.626 --> 00:42:27.710
I'm sorry. Madison.
It's all my fault.

743
00:42:27.796 --> 00:42:29.212
I thought I would be
doing him a favor.

744
00:42:29.297 --> 00:42:31.506
He's just been so cooped up
in that house.

745
00:42:31.633 --> 00:42:32.924
How is he now?

746
00:42:33.009 --> 00:42:34.551
Your father suffered
a minor knee injury

747
00:42:34.636 --> 00:42:36.177
and a bump on the head.

748
00:42:36.304 --> 00:42:39.514
I don't see any signs
of fractures or concussion.

749
00:42:39.641 --> 00:42:41.057
I see no reason
to keep him overnight.

750
00:42:41.142 --> 00:42:43.017
It was lucky Rebecca was
with him when it happened.

751
00:42:43.144 --> 00:42:44.677
She had to carry him
back to the car herself

752
00:42:44.771 --> 00:42:46.312
to get him here so quickly.

753
00:42:46.398 --> 00:42:49.015
It's nothing.
He's exaggerating.

754
00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:51.776
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Enough with all the fuss.

755
00:42:51.861 --> 00:42:53.695
You're hurt. Dad.

756
00:42:53.822 --> 00:42:55.697
Doctor: That knee
will need time to heal.

757
00:42:55.824 --> 00:42:57.699
Four to six weeks
with no pressure on it.

758
00:42:57.826 --> 00:43:00.159
You'll need to use a cane
for mobility as well.

759
00:43:00.245 --> 00:43:01.744
I wanna see you
for a follow-up next week.

760
00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:04.247
Thank you. Dr. Lund.

761
00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:10.587
Uh. what do I do now?

762
00:43:10.672 --> 00:43:13.047
He's gonna need 24-hour care
for the next month.

763
00:43:13.174 --> 00:43:14.591
Can you recommend
any caregiving agencies?

764
00:43:14.676 --> 00:43:16.384
I certainly can.

765
00:43:16.511 --> 00:43:18.544
but there's an extremely long
waiting list for these services.

766
00:43:18.638 --> 00:43:20.221
It could take weeks--

767
00:43:20.348 --> 00:43:24.392
I don't want no rent-a-nurse!
I've got Rebecca.

768
00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:29.564
(sighing) Dad. you need
someone there at night.

769
00:43:29.691 --> 00:43:31.107
What if you fall again?

770
00:43:31.192 --> 00:43:33.559
Just getting up the stairs
is gonna be a struggle.

771
00:43:33.653 --> 00:43:35.903
You need someone there
with you full-time.

772
00:43:36.031 --> 00:43:38.731
That would be
no problem whatsoever.

773
00:43:38.825 --> 00:43:40.066
Are you sure. Rebecca?

774
00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:42.285
That's an awfully big
commitment.

775
00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:45.237
"In for a penny.
in for a pound."

776
00:43:45.332 --> 00:43:47.081
my dad always said.

777
00:43:47.208 --> 00:43:50.242
Dad? What do you think?

778
00:43:50.337 --> 00:43:52.503
Well. that depends.

779
00:43:54.674 --> 00:43:56.716
What are you making
for dinner?

780
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:03.931
The room's all yours.

781
00:44:04.059 --> 00:44:06.100
Please make yourself
at home.

782
00:44:06.227 --> 00:44:09.937
I'm sorry I can't stay.
I have a meeting early tomorrow.

783
00:44:10.065 --> 00:44:12.106
This'll do perfectly.

784
00:44:12.233 --> 00:44:13.650
I should maybe check on Warren
one more time.

785
00:44:13.735 --> 00:44:16.444
It's okay. Rebecca.
He's out like a light.

786
00:44:16.571 --> 00:44:18.696
I'll drop by as soon
as I can tomorrow.

787
00:44:18.782 --> 00:44:21.658
and thanks again for taking
such good care of my dad.

788
00:44:21.743 --> 00:44:23.109
Yeah.

789
00:44:23.203 --> 00:44:24.777
Madison. you've got
nothing to worry about.

790
00:44:24.871 --> 00:44:26.454
I assure you. I've got
everything under control.

791
00:44:57.404 --> 00:45:05.993
â™ª

792
00:45:06.121 --> 00:45:08.287
(beeping)

793
00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:18.715
(beeping)

794
00:45:34.691 --> 00:45:36.357
(beeping)

795
00:45:43.491 --> 00:45:46.534
(beeping continuing)

796
00:45:59.007 --> 00:46:00.631
Ugh. damnit!

797
00:46:11.311 --> 00:46:12.685
(sighing)

798
00:46:14.856 --> 00:46:16.773
Think. Rebecca. think.

799
00:46:27.535 --> 00:46:37.502
â™ª

800
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:45.426
(door creaking)

801
00:47:08.409 --> 00:47:15.540
â™ª

802
00:47:23.591 --> 00:47:33.599
â™ª

803
00:47:36.437 --> 00:47:38.020
Ruth?

804
00:47:48.157 --> 00:47:49.657
Ruth.

805
00:48:14.767 --> 00:48:17.343
I'm here. Warren.
It's me.

806
00:48:17.437 --> 00:48:19.345
I missed you so much.

807
00:48:19.439 --> 00:48:21.105
I know.

808
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:24.066
Warren. I've missed you too.
So much.

809
00:48:24.152 --> 00:48:27.028
I've been away
because I'm in trouble.

810
00:48:27.155 --> 00:48:29.864
I really need
what's in this safe.

811
00:48:29.991 --> 00:48:32.825
The safe?

812
00:48:37.957 --> 00:48:39.498
I need you to tell me
the combination.

813
00:48:39.584 --> 00:48:42.126
There's something
so very important inside.

814
00:48:42.211 --> 00:48:44.211
Of course. dear.

815
00:48:46.132 --> 00:48:48.257
What is it. darling?

816
00:48:49.761 --> 00:48:51.719
I can't remember!

817
00:48:51.846 --> 00:48:55.306
(sniffing)
I can't-- remember!

818
00:48:56.851 --> 00:48:59.435
I know. honey. I know.

819
00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:01.771
Let's get you to bed.

820
00:49:14.702 --> 00:49:16.410
(car approaching outside)

821
00:49:21.751 --> 00:49:23.501
(lock chirping)

822
00:49:35.348 --> 00:49:44.355
â™ª

823
00:49:46.693 --> 00:49:48.818
Oh. Rebecca. you scared me.

824
00:49:48.903 --> 00:49:50.987
Oh. I'm sorry.
I wasn't expecting you.

825
00:49:51.072 --> 00:49:52.947
Is there something
the matter?

826
00:49:53.074 --> 00:49:55.950
I'm here to see
how my dad is doing.

827
00:49:56.077 --> 00:49:58.110
How's his leg this morning?
Is he up?

828
00:49:58.204 --> 00:49:59.620
Of course. of course.

829
00:49:59.747 --> 00:50:01.947
I'm just a little surprised
to see you is all.

830
00:50:02.041 --> 00:50:03.499
Was I supposed
to call ahead?

831
00:50:03.584 --> 00:50:06.618
No. no. Of course not.

832
00:50:06.713 --> 00:50:09.338
He's just still sleeping.
He had kind of an off night.

833
00:50:09.424 --> 00:50:12.425
Oh. What do you mean
by "off night"?

834
00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:15.094
He woke up in the middle of the
night. he got a little confused.

835
00:50:15.179 --> 00:50:17.471
He's sleeping it off
now though.

836
00:50:17.598 --> 00:50:19.390
I'm sorry to hear that.

837
00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:22.018
I'll put on
a pot of coffee?

838
00:50:22.103 --> 00:50:23.436
Sure thing.

839
00:50:35.116 --> 00:50:44.915
â™ª

840
00:50:51.758 --> 00:50:53.924
What exactly happened
last night?

841
00:50:54.010 --> 00:50:55.926
Is it something Dr. Lund
should know about?

842
00:50:57.638 --> 00:51:01.057
Warren's been experiencing
some mild hallucinations.

843
00:51:01.142 --> 00:51:03.509
Seeing things
that aren't really there.

844
00:51:03.603 --> 00:51:05.853
Par for the course. I'm afraid.
at this stage.

845
00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:08.731
Is he still wandering?

846
00:51:08.816 --> 00:51:10.316
Did you find that watch?

847
00:51:13.029 --> 00:51:14.186
Ah.

848
00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:15.521
Warren:
Ruth!

849
00:51:15.615 --> 00:51:17.823
Is that you?

850
00:51:17.909 --> 00:51:19.950
Is he still calling
for my mom?

851
00:51:20.036 --> 00:51:21.202
I should go check on him.

852
00:51:21.329 --> 00:51:23.362
Uh. I think
I should go first.

853
00:51:23.456 --> 00:51:26.082
It's just-- he's not expecting
you. It may upset him.

854
00:51:26.167 --> 00:51:27.875
Upset him?
I'm his daughter.

855
00:51:28.002 --> 00:51:30.252
Let me just peek in and make
sure that he's calmed down.

856
00:51:30.338 --> 00:51:31.754
I'll be right back.
The coffee's ready.

857
00:51:40.807 --> 00:51:44.391
Warren!
Is everything okay?

858
00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:48.220
Rebecca! You know me.

859
00:51:48.314 --> 00:51:50.397
Of course. Rebecca.

860
00:51:50.525 --> 00:51:51.982
You called out for Ruth.

861
00:51:52.068 --> 00:51:55.778
I must've gotten confused.

862
00:51:55.863 --> 00:51:57.729
I had the strangest dream
last night.

863
00:51:57.824 --> 00:52:00.950
Well. you're still adjusting
to your new medication.

864
00:52:01.035 --> 00:52:03.244
How do you feel now?

865
00:52:03.371 --> 00:52:05.571
Better. Foggy.

866
00:52:05.665 --> 00:52:07.790
Great news. Madison's here!

867
00:52:07.875 --> 00:52:09.625
Oh. wonderful.
(chuckling)

868
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:11.001
Let's get you freshened up

869
00:52:11.087 --> 00:52:13.796
and get your cane
and your morning pills.

870
00:52:16.425 --> 00:52:19.176
(phone vibrating)

871
00:52:24.725 --> 00:52:26.142
Yes?
This is Rebecca Wilson.

872
00:52:26.227 --> 00:52:28.144
Rebecca. this is Dr. Lund
calling.

873
00:52:28.229 --> 00:52:30.062
I've been informed
you're acting as intermediary

874
00:52:30.148 --> 00:52:32.022
between Warren Lockhart
and his family?

875
00:52:32.108 --> 00:52:33.649
That's correct.

876
00:52:33.734 --> 00:52:36.443
What can I do for you. Doctor?
I'm awfully busy.

877
00:52:36.571 --> 00:52:38.070
I'm calling to let you know

878
00:52:38.156 --> 00:52:40.656
the results of Warren's
blood test came back. and--

879
00:52:40.741 --> 00:52:43.159
I'm concerned about the levels
of temazepam we've detected.

880
00:52:43.244 --> 00:52:46.445
I'd prescribed a small dose
to help him sleep.

881
00:52:46.539 --> 00:52:47.872
but if these levels
are accurate

882
00:52:47.957 --> 00:52:49.665
I'd be surprised
if he can make it out of bed

883
00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:51.116
or function at all.

884
00:52:51.210 --> 00:52:53.794
We need to schedule
an immediate follow-up.

885
00:52:53.921 --> 00:52:55.421
Thank you. Doctor.

886
00:52:55.506 --> 00:52:58.757
This is terribly concerning.
I'll get right on that.

887
00:53:07.935 --> 00:53:10.135
Hi. Dad.

888
00:53:10.229 --> 00:53:11.353
How are you?

889
00:53:11.439 --> 00:53:13.314
Just you visiting.
no Hayley?

890
00:53:13.441 --> 00:53:16.025
It's just me. Dad.
Hayley's busy at school.

891
00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:17.568
but she wants
to come see you later.

892
00:53:17.653 --> 00:53:20.029
Here's the coffee for you.
Warren.

893
00:53:20.114 --> 00:53:21.322
Just how you like it.

894
00:53:21.449 --> 00:53:23.148
And what can I get you
for breakfast?

895
00:53:23.242 --> 00:53:26.285
Actually. Rebecca. if you don't
mind giving us a minute first?

896
00:53:28.331 --> 00:53:29.488
Let me know if you need
anything.

897
00:53:29.582 --> 00:53:31.081
Okay.

898
00:53:32.210 --> 00:53:33.792
Come.

899
00:53:39.467 --> 00:53:41.300
How's everything going
with you two. Dad?

900
00:53:41.385 --> 00:53:42.551
With Rebecca?

901
00:53:42.637 --> 00:53:44.503
(chuckling)

902
00:53:44.597 --> 00:53:47.005
You wouldn't have to ask
if you were around more.

903
00:53:47.099 --> 00:53:48.840
Dad. that's not fair.

904
00:53:48.935 --> 00:53:50.851
I was here yesterday.

905
00:53:50.978 --> 00:53:52.728
It seems like
you're always sleeping.

906
00:53:52.813 --> 00:53:54.230
I'm trying.

907
00:53:54.315 --> 00:53:57.233
We've been trying
to spare you the details.

908
00:53:57.318 --> 00:54:00.402
but it's been very chaotic
at the firm.

909
00:54:00.488 --> 00:54:03.030
In fact. there is something
we need to talk about.

910
00:54:03.157 --> 00:54:04.573
I don't wanna talk
about the firm.

911
00:54:04.659 --> 00:54:07.159
I don't wanna talk
about any of that right now.

912
00:54:07.245 --> 00:54:08.535
Where's Rebecca?

913
00:54:08.663 --> 00:54:10.079
We were supposed
to go for ice cream.

914
00:54:10.164 --> 00:54:13.457
Ice cream?
Dad. it's 8:30 in the morn--

915
00:54:15.336 --> 00:54:18.420
Dad. are you sure
you're okay?

916
00:54:18.506 --> 00:54:20.589
Maybe we need to make another
appointment with Dr. Lund.

917
00:54:20.675 --> 00:54:24.543
No. No more hospitals.

918
00:54:24.637 --> 00:54:27.888
Just let Rebecca work her magic.
I'll be fine.

919
00:54:37.358 --> 00:54:39.725
I left Dr. Lund's number
on the table.

920
00:54:39.819 --> 00:54:41.610
I'm sorry I have to rush
back to work.

921
00:54:41.696 --> 00:54:43.737
but if anything changes.
please call me.

922
00:54:43.864 --> 00:54:45.489
Of course.

923
00:54:45.574 --> 00:54:47.241
- Hey.
- Hayley!

924
00:54:47.368 --> 00:54:49.401
Grandpa's gonna be so happy
to see you.

925
00:54:49.495 --> 00:54:51.453
Yeah. I picked up some
of his favorite gummies.

926
00:54:51.539 --> 00:54:53.122
Dad told me
about his leg.

927
00:54:53.207 --> 00:54:54.957
That's so thoughtful of you.
sweetheart.

928
00:54:55.042 --> 00:54:56.500
He's gonna love it.

929
00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:02.080
You've raised
such a lovely daughter.

930
00:55:02.174 --> 00:55:04.633
I have. haven't I?

931
00:55:04.719 --> 00:55:06.918
At least
I got that part right.

932
00:55:07.013 --> 00:55:08.420
I should go.

933
00:55:08.514 --> 00:55:10.472
- Thanks again. Rebecca.
- Pleasure's all mine.

934
00:55:14.228 --> 00:55:15.769
(car engine starting)

935
00:55:24.905 --> 00:55:26.322
How was your visit?

936
00:55:28.534 --> 00:55:30.409
Rebecca. Hey. you scared me.

937
00:55:31.996 --> 00:55:34.580
Don't be scared. honey!
Come sit. let's have a chat.

938
00:55:36.584 --> 00:55:37.750
About what?

939
00:55:37.835 --> 00:55:40.044
About you. silly!

940
00:55:40.129 --> 00:55:41.620
How's school?

941
00:55:41.714 --> 00:55:43.121
Are you seeing anyone special?

942
00:55:43.215 --> 00:55:44.790
I see they fixed that dent.

943
00:55:44.884 --> 00:55:47.384
It's almost as if
that little accident of yours

944
00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:49.511
never happened. isn't it?

945
00:55:49.597 --> 00:55:50.763
You know.
it's a really good thing

946
00:55:50.848 --> 00:55:52.306
that you only hit
that flower pot.

947
00:55:52.433 --> 00:55:55.351
Imagine if that had been
a person or your grandpa.

948
00:55:55.436 --> 00:55:58.136
You do remember. right?

949
00:55:58.230 --> 00:56:01.982
'Cause if you need a reminder.
I have photos.

950
00:56:02.109 --> 00:56:04.476
Wanna see?

951
00:56:04.570 --> 00:56:06.070
What do you want. Rebecca?

952
00:56:06.155 --> 00:56:07.646
(sighing)

953
00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:11.149
The truth is. Hayley. I--
I really need your help.

954
00:56:11.243 --> 00:56:12.868
I'm at my wit's end
and I don't know what to do.

955
00:56:12.953 --> 00:56:14.119
Why? What's going on?

956
00:56:14.205 --> 00:56:16.246
It's this watch.

957
00:56:16.332 --> 00:56:17.823
Your grandfather's watch.

958
00:56:17.917 --> 00:56:20.542
It's all he talks about.
all he thinks about.

959
00:56:20.628 --> 00:56:22.828
I can't get him to eat.
I can't get him to sleep.

960
00:56:22.922 --> 00:56:24.755
He can't find his watch?
That doesn't sound so bad.

961
00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:25.997
He's got like ten of them.

962
00:56:26.092 --> 00:56:28.500
Oh no. no.
You don't understand.

963
00:56:28.594 --> 00:56:29.927
For someone
with Warren's condition.

964
00:56:30.012 --> 00:56:33.180
the mind obsesses
over this thing.

965
00:56:33.307 --> 00:56:36.174
He's convinced.
absolutely convinced

966
00:56:36.268 --> 00:56:37.843
that he locked it
in his safe.

967
00:56:37.937 --> 00:56:41.063
The one in his room where
Grandma kept her old jewels?

968
00:56:41.148 --> 00:56:42.856
Hmm.

969
00:56:42.983 --> 00:56:45.109
If there was someone
who knew a way to open it.

970
00:56:45.194 --> 00:56:46.777
it would make
a huge difference to Warren.

971
00:56:46.862 --> 00:56:49.613
to both of us.

972
00:56:49.698 --> 00:56:51.523
I'm not helping you get
into Grandpa's safe.

973
00:56:51.617 --> 00:56:52.699
Rebecca. that's crazy.

974
00:56:52.827 --> 00:56:55.244
Why don't you just ask my mom?

975
00:56:55.329 --> 00:56:57.028
Oh. trust me. I would.

976
00:56:57.123 --> 00:56:59.498
but Warren begged me not to.

977
00:56:59.583 --> 00:57:01.417
He's embarrassed.

978
00:57:01.502 --> 00:57:04.044
Your mom can have such
high expectations. you know?

979
00:57:04.171 --> 00:57:06.880
He feels like she's judging him.
belittling him.

980
00:57:08.843 --> 00:57:10.884
Yeah. I guess
she can be like that.

981
00:57:12.555 --> 00:57:13.720
Look.

982
00:57:13.848 --> 00:57:17.141
I don't know the combination.

983
00:57:17.226 --> 00:57:20.185
But I know that Grandpa
used to keep a notepad around.

984
00:57:20.271 --> 00:57:21.478
He used it
to write down stuff

985
00:57:21.564 --> 00:57:23.555
he was having trouble
remembering.

986
00:57:23.649 --> 00:57:26.733
If it's not here. it's probably
still at his office.

987
00:57:26.861 --> 00:57:28.735
You should ask Nia.

988
00:57:29.697 --> 00:57:31.363
His office.

989
00:57:31.449 --> 00:57:32.614
Thanks so much. Hayley.

990
00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:35.117
You've been
such a great help.

991
00:57:35.202 --> 00:57:37.953
I'll do that.
I'll ask Nia.

992
00:57:38.038 --> 00:57:39.496
Are we even now?

993
00:57:39.582 --> 00:57:42.541
Of course. honey!
It'll be our little secret.

994
00:57:42.626 --> 00:57:44.126
Okay.

995
00:57:52.845 --> 00:57:55.345
I got the strangest feeling
in the house today.

996
00:57:55.431 --> 00:57:58.924
And then seeing my mom's
earrings just sitting there?

997
00:57:59.018 --> 00:58:00.642
Your dad hasn't been
sleeping well.

998
00:58:00.728 --> 00:58:02.853
Maybe he moved them when
he was up wandering around

999
00:58:02.938 --> 00:58:04.763
in the middle of the night.

1000
00:58:04.857 --> 00:58:07.357
You said he's been moving
all sorts of stuff.

1001
00:58:07.443 --> 00:58:08.934
He's an old man with
memory problems. Emmett.

1002
00:58:09.028 --> 00:58:10.152
not a poltergeist.

1003
00:58:10.237 --> 00:58:11.987
I know this might
sound crazy.

1004
00:58:12.072 --> 00:58:15.324
but I could've sworn she was
wearing my mother's perfume.

1005
00:58:17.703 --> 00:58:19.328
You're right.
That does sound crazy.

1006
00:58:19.413 --> 00:58:22.280
Honey. why?

1007
00:58:22.374 --> 00:58:24.449
I'm gonna ask Arnold to run
a background check.

1008
00:58:24.543 --> 00:58:26.284
if he still has
those old police contacts.

1009
00:58:26.378 --> 00:58:27.544
Don't you think--
(exhaling)

1010
00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:30.172
--that's a bit
of an overreaction?

1011
00:58:30.257 --> 00:58:32.841
Honey. you've got that call
to Berlin tomorrow morning.

1012
00:58:32.927 --> 00:58:34.426
You have
a big decision to make.

1013
00:58:34.512 --> 00:58:38.096
You need to let this go
for tonight. get some rest.

1014
00:58:39.266 --> 00:58:40.516
Come here.

1015
00:58:46.482 --> 00:58:48.306
Can we forget about this
for just one night?

1016
00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:49.816
Yeah.

1017
00:59:05.626 --> 00:59:08.994
Let's hope no one
changed Warren's codes.

1018
00:59:09.088 --> 00:59:10.546
We'll see if Hayley was right.

1019
00:59:23.310 --> 00:59:24.476
All right.

1020
00:59:24.562 --> 00:59:26.144
Check every drawer
and every shelf.

1021
00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:28.063
Look for any notepads.
any post-it notes.

1022
00:59:28.148 --> 00:59:29.398
anything with a string
of numbers on it.

1023
00:59:29.483 --> 00:59:31.850
Any numbers at all.

1024
00:59:31.944 --> 00:59:33.193
Jesse:
Numbers?

1025
00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:35.028
We're standing
in an investment firm!

1026
00:59:35.155 --> 00:59:36.905
Just keep looking.

1027
00:59:36.991 --> 00:59:38.532
Go check those other offices.

1028
00:59:46.667 --> 00:59:47.916
This is a Crestview.

1029
00:59:48.002 --> 00:59:50.210
This costs more
than my car.

1030
00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:55.424
Can I help you?

1031
00:59:55.509 --> 00:59:56.875
Rebecca.
what are you doing here?

1032
00:59:56.969 --> 00:59:59.720
You have no business
being here.

1033
00:59:59.847 --> 01:00:01.305
What the hell's going on?

1034
01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:02.681
I'm just here for Warren.

1035
01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:04.433
He lost that watch again.

1036
01:00:04.518 --> 01:00:05.767
Can you believe it?

1037
01:00:05.853 --> 01:00:08.020
He's convinced
that he left it here.

1038
01:00:08.105 --> 01:00:11.064
He's in one of those moods.
you know. inconsolable.

1039
01:00:11.191 --> 01:00:14.484
I can't get him to eat.
I can't get him to sleep--

1040
01:00:14.570 --> 01:00:16.528
not without that watch.

1041
01:00:16.614 --> 01:00:19.230
I didn't know what else to do
so I just came here to get it.

1042
01:00:19.325 --> 01:00:21.658
It's all been
really overwhelming.

1043
01:00:21.744 --> 01:00:23.619
I'm listening. Rebecca.

1044
01:00:23.704 --> 01:00:25.329
I'm just gonna
make a quick call.

1045
01:00:25.414 --> 01:00:26.955
Not another step. Rebecca.

1046
01:00:28.542 --> 01:00:30.742
We'll let the police
work this out.

1047
01:00:30.836 --> 01:00:32.711
(screaming)

1048
01:00:40.554 --> 01:00:41.970
Madison.

1049
01:00:42.056 --> 01:00:44.589
Are you all right?
Your call sounded urgent.

1050
01:00:44.683 --> 01:00:47.059
Nia mentioned that
you were leaning

1051
01:00:47.144 --> 01:00:49.144
towards accepting
the Berlin offer.

1052
01:00:49.229 --> 01:00:50.762
You know my thoughts
on that.

1053
01:00:50.856 --> 01:00:52.814
I'm not here to talk
about the firm. Arnold.

1054
01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:56.109
I told them I'll have
my decision by end of day.

1055
01:00:56.236 --> 01:00:57.486
I'm here to talk
about Rebecca Wilson.

1056
01:00:57.571 --> 01:01:00.271
What about her?

1057
01:01:00.366 --> 01:01:03.367
You still have
those old contacts?

1058
01:01:03.452 --> 01:01:04.776
Some. What do you need?

1059
01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:08.455
I want you
to look into her for me.

1060
01:01:08.582 --> 01:01:11.375
Maybe I'm just being paranoid.
but I need to know for sure.

1061
01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:14.044
and please be discreet.

1062
01:01:14.129 --> 01:01:16.755
I'll do anything I can.
Madison.

1063
01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:19.624
No matter what happens. you know
I always have your back. right?

1064
01:01:19.718 --> 01:01:21.051
(phone notification dinging)

1065
01:01:22.554 --> 01:01:25.138
Something's happened
at the office.

1066
01:01:32.606 --> 01:01:33.897
What happened here?

1067
01:01:33.982 --> 01:01:36.775
Who is that? Nia?

1068
01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:39.569
Nia? Nia. no!

1069
01:01:39.655 --> 01:01:41.613
No! (crying)
No. no. no!

1070
01:01:50.124 --> 01:01:51.498
Maddy. you're okay.

1071
01:01:54.044 --> 01:01:55.493
I'm not okay.

1072
01:01:55.587 --> 01:01:57.254
Nia. she--

1073
01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:00.424
What happened?

1074
01:02:00.509 --> 01:02:02.500
They think it was a robbery.

1075
01:02:02.594 --> 01:02:05.846
There's nothing on camera.
They stole the security tapes.

1076
01:02:05.973 --> 01:02:07.264
But who? Why?

1077
01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:09.182
What were they after. money?

1078
01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:11.676
Client files?

1079
01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:13.562
They ransacked the office.

1080
01:02:13.647 --> 01:02:15.939
They're not clear
what the goal was. but--

1081
01:02:16.024 --> 01:02:17.357
Nia must have
surprised them.

1082
01:02:17.484 --> 01:02:20.185
(exhaling)

1083
01:02:20.279 --> 01:02:21.445
Why would anyone do this.
Emmett?

1084
01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:23.572
Why would someone
wanna hurt Nia?

1085
01:02:26.994 --> 01:02:29.286
(beeping)

1086
01:02:29.371 --> 01:02:30.996
It's not working.

1087
01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:32.539
I've tried every number
we found.

1088
01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:34.666
Try again.

1089
01:02:34.752 --> 01:02:36.543
Rebecca:
We're running out of time.

1090
01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:38.503
I should pound it
out of him.

1091
01:02:41.842 --> 01:02:43.842
We can't interrogate it
out of him.

1092
01:02:43.927 --> 01:02:46.803
We need to coax it out.

1093
01:02:46.889 --> 01:02:48.138
We need to trigger
that memory.

1094
01:02:48.223 --> 01:02:49.723
How?

1095
01:02:49.850 --> 01:02:52.267
By giving him back
what he wants most.

1096
01:02:52.352 --> 01:02:54.728
What no one else can.

1097
01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:18.710
(soft piano music playing)

1098
01:03:26.094 --> 01:03:29.012
(muffled music drifting up
from downstairs)

1099
01:03:53.038 --> 01:03:59.876
â™ª

1100
01:04:02.631 --> 01:04:04.714
Hello?

1101
01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.591
Is anybody here?

1102
01:04:06.677 --> 01:04:09.052
I'm here. Warren.

1103
01:04:13.308 --> 01:04:16.142
Ruth.

1104
01:04:16.270 --> 01:04:17.686
I'll always be here.

1105
01:04:17.771 --> 01:04:19.229
Oh. don't worry.
I've got you.

1106
01:04:24.278 --> 01:04:25.819
Hmm.

1107
01:04:27.865 --> 01:04:29.647
You remember this song?

1108
01:04:29.741 --> 01:04:32.534
It was playing
the first night we met.

1109
01:04:32.619 --> 01:04:34.452
Oh. Warren.
how could I forget?

1110
01:04:35.956 --> 01:04:38.373
- I missed you.
- I've missed you too.

1111
01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:41.334
And I can't wait to catch up.

1112
01:04:41.461 --> 01:04:45.964
But I just need you
to tell me one thing. sweetie.

1113
01:04:46.049 --> 01:04:47.674
What's the combination?

1114
01:04:47.801 --> 01:04:50.051
Combination?

1115
01:04:50.137 --> 01:04:51.511
(chuckling)
Oh. you silly man!

1116
01:04:51.638 --> 01:04:53.471
To the safe.

1117
01:04:53.557 --> 01:04:55.807
where we keep all
of our favorite things.

1118
01:04:55.893 --> 01:04:57.726
I've left a gift
for you inside.

1119
01:04:57.811 --> 01:05:00.812
A present for my beau.

1120
01:05:00.898 --> 01:05:03.607
We created them together.

1121
01:05:03.692 --> 01:05:08.186
88-04-11.

1122
01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:11.239
The day Madison lost
her first tooth.

1123
01:05:12.951 --> 01:05:14.409
Thank you for that.

1124
01:05:14.494 --> 01:05:16.694
You've given me so much.

1125
01:05:16.788 --> 01:05:18.863
Wait here. honey.
I'll be right back.

1126
01:05:18.957 --> 01:05:20.248
Okay.

1127
01:05:25.839 --> 01:05:27.797
(steps creaking)

1128
01:05:27.883 --> 01:05:29.674
(beeping)

1129
01:05:37.684 --> 01:05:39.309
Oh.

1130
01:05:50.656 --> 01:05:51.947
(sighing)

1131
01:05:54.326 --> 01:05:56.451
It's all here. Jesse.

1132
01:05:56.536 --> 01:05:57.994
Everything we hoped for.

1133
01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:00.830
Dad was right.

1134
01:06:00.916 --> 01:06:03.074
Now let's get the hell
out of here while we still can.

1135
01:06:03.168 --> 01:06:04.960
(doorbell ringing)

1136
01:06:09.341 --> 01:06:10.757
Wait here.

1137
01:06:21.436 --> 01:06:22.602
Rebecca:
Arnold!

1138
01:06:22.729 --> 01:06:25.605
Wasn't it?

1139
01:06:25.732 --> 01:06:28.108
I think we met
at Ruth Lockhart's wake.

1140
01:06:28.235 --> 01:06:29.434
Warren's bookkeeper.

1141
01:06:29.528 --> 01:06:31.903
Hmm. Best Man and CFO.

1142
01:06:31.989 --> 01:06:33.196
I'm here to see Warren.

1143
01:06:33.281 --> 01:06:35.615
He hasn't been
returning my calls.

1144
01:06:35.742 --> 01:06:39.035
You know. it's--
it's uncanny.

1145
01:06:39.121 --> 01:06:41.621
In that dress.
you're a spitting image of Ruth.

1146
01:06:41.748 --> 01:06:43.248
Where'd you get it?

1147
01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:44.457
Oh. I don't know.

1148
01:06:44.584 --> 01:06:46.209
Some vintage bin
down in Wallaceburg.

1149
01:06:46.294 --> 01:06:49.713
If there's a message
I'm happy to relay it.

1150
01:06:49.798 --> 01:06:51.756
Oh? Is Warren indisposed?

1151
01:06:51.842 --> 01:06:56.136
He's suffering a degenerative
brain disease. Arnold.

1152
01:06:56.263 --> 01:06:57.929
Yes. I'd say he's indisposed.

1153
01:07:00.308 --> 01:07:04.019
Um. Dr. Lund recently switched
Warren's medication.

1154
01:07:04.104 --> 01:07:05.636
He hasn't been
sleeping well.

1155
01:07:05.731 --> 01:07:09.566
Neither of us has been
sleeping much. I'll admit.

1156
01:07:09.651 --> 01:07:12.235
There have been
a few episodes.

1157
01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:14.279
Uh-huh.

1158
01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:17.365
Rebecca. I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to insist on seeing Warren.

1159
01:07:17.451 --> 01:07:18.908
I have news.

1160
01:07:30.088 --> 01:07:31.996
Arnold. Is that you?

1161
01:07:32.090 --> 01:07:34.007
Warren?

1162
01:07:34.134 --> 01:07:36.634
- It's been years!
- Years?

1163
01:07:38.597 --> 01:07:41.389
Years. Warren. I--

1164
01:07:41.475 --> 01:07:42.849
We should sit down.

1165
01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.906
I need to speak
to my friend. alone.

1166
01:08:07.334 --> 01:08:11.294
There was a break-in. Warren.
at Lockhart Investments.

1167
01:08:11.379 --> 01:08:13.088
Nia was there at the time.
She--

1168
01:08:13.173 --> 01:08:16.216
I am so sorry. Warren.

1169
01:08:17.344 --> 01:08:18.510
Nia's dead.

1170
01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:21.429
Nia? No.

1171
01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:24.849
Where's Madison?

1172
01:08:24.935 --> 01:08:26.551
She couldn't come herself?

1173
01:08:26.645 --> 01:08:27.894
Madison is still
at the firm.

1174
01:08:28.021 --> 01:08:29.521
She's speaking to police.

1175
01:08:29.606 --> 01:08:33.608
I thought it would be better
if you heard it from me.

1176
01:08:33.693 --> 01:08:37.112
(whispering) Warren.
we can speak in confidence.

1177
01:08:38.698 --> 01:08:41.908
Are you okay? Is she
mistreating you in some way?

1178
01:08:42.035 --> 01:08:44.452
What is this really all about.
Arnold?

1179
01:08:44.538 --> 01:08:45.736
Is this about my estate?

1180
01:08:45.831 --> 01:08:48.206
What? No.

1181
01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:50.083
Madison told me
about your little plan.

1182
01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:53.586
Out there looking
for offers to buy me out.

1183
01:08:53.713 --> 01:08:55.088
Warren. I assure you.

1184
01:08:55.215 --> 01:08:57.415
I would never do anything
that was contrary

1185
01:08:57.509 --> 01:09:00.343
to the best interests
of you or your family.

1186
01:09:00.428 --> 01:09:01.594
Warren!

1187
01:09:01.721 --> 01:09:03.588
Your family is my family.

1188
01:09:03.682 --> 01:09:07.433
I trusted you. Arnold.
You were like a brother to me.

1189
01:09:07.561 --> 01:09:08.935
This is how you repay me?

1190
01:09:09.062 --> 01:09:11.271
How could you?

1191
01:09:11.398 --> 01:09:14.432
You were my best friend!

1192
01:09:14.526 --> 01:09:16.434
(sighing)

1193
01:09:16.528 --> 01:09:17.902
Get out.

1194
01:09:19.239 --> 01:09:21.281
Get out!

1195
01:09:21.408 --> 01:09:23.116
I think that's enough.

1196
01:09:23.243 --> 01:09:24.159
Warren. Warren. I--

1197
01:09:24.244 --> 01:09:26.244
Please. You need to go.

1198
01:09:28.915 --> 01:09:31.782
I'm so sorry. Warren.

1199
01:09:31.877 --> 01:09:34.836
I'm so sorry
I've let this happen.

1200
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:40.091
I'll be back soon.

1201
01:09:42.053 --> 01:09:43.344
(sighing)

1202
01:09:45.307 --> 01:09:47.807
(door opening. closing)

1203
01:09:47.934 --> 01:09:57.817
â™ª

1204
01:09:57.944 --> 01:10:00.811
Madison. call me back
right away.

1205
01:10:00.906 --> 01:10:02.030
I've just been
to see your father.

1206
01:10:02.115 --> 01:10:04.073
Something is very wrong.

1207
01:10:10.582 --> 01:10:12.999
Joshua.

1208
01:10:13.126 --> 01:10:15.335
Were you able to run that check
on Rebeca Wilson?

1209
01:10:17.797 --> 01:10:19.881
But that's not possible.

1210
01:10:21.051 --> 01:10:23.092
Are you sure?

1211
01:10:23.178 --> 01:10:25.595
You're absolutely sure?

1212
01:10:27.974 --> 01:10:29.557
All right.
Thank you. Joshua.

1213
01:10:29.643 --> 01:10:31.893
Please keep this confidential.

1214
01:10:43.323 --> 01:10:45.856
I just can't believe it.

1215
01:10:45.951 --> 01:10:49.118
She was my best friend.
Emmett.

1216
01:10:49.204 --> 01:10:51.913
I feel like my life
is unraveling so fast.

1217
01:10:51.998 --> 01:10:54.165
(sighing)
I gotta go see Dad.

1218
01:10:54.251 --> 01:10:56.534
tell him the news.
He adored Nia.

1219
01:10:56.628 --> 01:10:58.202
I asked Arnold to.

1220
01:10:58.296 --> 01:10:59.420
You have enough on your plate.

1221
01:10:59.506 --> 01:11:01.130
You did?

1222
01:11:03.843 --> 01:11:05.260
Hayley:
I got your call. Mom.

1223
01:11:08.014 --> 01:11:09.222
Nia?

1224
01:11:09.349 --> 01:11:10.932
Now Nia?
What the hell is happening?

1225
01:11:11.017 --> 01:11:13.142
Honey. come here.

1226
01:11:19.025 --> 01:11:20.558
(sighing)
We're gonna get through this.

1227
01:11:20.652 --> 01:11:22.860
Hayley. as a family.

1228
01:11:22.946 --> 01:11:24.729
Just gotta be strong
and help each other.

1229
01:11:24.823 --> 01:11:28.199
Mom...

1230
01:11:28.285 --> 01:11:29.909
Dad. there's something
I need to tell you.

1231
01:11:30.036 --> 01:11:32.620
About Rebecca.

1232
01:11:40.213 --> 01:11:41.746
Hello? Dad?

1233
01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.080
Anybody?

1234
01:11:43.174 --> 01:11:44.966
Warren?

1235
01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:55.593
Arnold:
Madison?

1236
01:11:55.687 --> 01:11:57.353
(gasping)

1237
01:11:57.439 --> 01:12:00.765
Madison? Madison?

1238
01:12:00.859 --> 01:12:01.983
Arnold?

1239
01:12:02.068 --> 01:12:05.320
Oh my God.
Did Rebecca do this?

1240
01:12:05.405 --> 01:12:06.571
Where is she?
Where is my dad?

1241
01:12:06.656 --> 01:12:11.284
Oh. my--
Your fa-- your father--

1242
01:12:11.411 --> 01:12:13.661
He kept secrets.

1243
01:12:13.747 --> 01:12:16.956
Terrible secrets from you
and from Ruth.

1244
01:12:17.083 --> 01:12:18.207
Rebecca. her--

1245
01:12:18.293 --> 01:12:21.836
Her real name is--

1246
01:12:21.921 --> 01:12:25.340
Jane Butler.

1247
01:12:25.425 --> 01:12:28.009
Her father was a client

1248
01:12:28.094 --> 01:12:31.012
of Warren Lockhart
Investments.

1249
01:12:31.097 --> 01:12:35.683
This is about revenge.

1250
01:12:35.769 --> 01:12:38.686
She has evidence. Madison.

1251
01:12:38.772 --> 01:12:41.189
Enough to take everything.

1252
01:12:42.609 --> 01:12:45.693
They've gone--
gone to the lake house.

1253
01:12:45.779 --> 01:12:48.112
Don't-- don't let her--

1254
01:12:48.198 --> 01:12:50.782
Don't let her take
everything we've built.

1255
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:53.201
Don't-- don't let her.

1256
01:12:53.286 --> 01:12:57.205
Arnold? Arnold?

1257
01:12:57.290 --> 01:12:59.374
Emmett. can you stay with him
until the ambulance gets here?

1258
01:12:59.459 --> 01:13:02.827
What? No! I'm going with you.
We'll wait for the police.

1259
01:13:02.921 --> 01:13:04.161
It's my dad.

1260
01:13:04.255 --> 01:13:06.547
my fault this is happening.

1261
01:13:06.633 --> 01:13:08.800
I let Rebecca in.
I have to fix this.

1262
01:13:39.165 --> 01:13:41.207
Where are we?
- We're here. Warren.

1263
01:13:41.334 --> 01:13:43.084
at your favorite place.

1264
01:13:43.169 --> 01:13:44.368
We're at the lake house.

1265
01:13:44.462 --> 01:13:46.295
Was I asleep
the entire drive?

1266
01:13:46.381 --> 01:13:48.673
(chuckling)
You slept like a baby.

1267
01:13:48.758 --> 01:13:50.299
Come on. sleepy head.
Let's go.

1268
01:14:06.317 --> 01:14:07.558
My God.

1269
01:14:07.652 --> 01:14:10.445
I forgot how grand
this place was.

1270
01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:12.196
We've been here before?

1271
01:14:12.282 --> 01:14:14.565
It's all so hazy.

1272
01:14:14.659 --> 01:14:16.993
It was a long drive. Warren.

1273
01:14:17.078 --> 01:14:19.287
Let's get you a drink
and get you comfortable.

1274
01:14:19.372 --> 01:14:22.623
Dr. Lund said I shouldn't
mix alcohol with my pills.

1275
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:25.293
But tonight
is a special night.

1276
01:14:25.378 --> 01:14:28.337
All those rules
are so far. far away.

1277
01:14:48.443 --> 01:14:51.936
I remember being here. once.

1278
01:14:52.030 --> 01:14:54.614
At this lake house.

1279
01:14:54.741 --> 01:14:57.274
Feels like forever ago.

1280
01:14:57.368 --> 01:15:00.411
I was with my dad.

1281
01:15:00.497 --> 01:15:02.279
And you were entertaining
important clients

1282
01:15:02.373 --> 01:15:04.957
to celebrate a banner year.

1283
01:15:05.084 --> 01:15:07.710
I remember diving
off that dock.

1284
01:15:07.795 --> 01:15:09.921
swimming in that water.

1285
01:15:11.341 --> 01:15:14.625
It's the last happy
childhood memory I have.

1286
01:15:14.719 --> 01:15:16.260
That summer.

1287
01:15:18.056 --> 01:15:20.640
I suppose it makes sense
this is where it ends.

1288
01:15:20.767 --> 01:15:23.726
I'm sorry.

1289
01:15:23.811 --> 01:15:25.811
I don't remember.

1290
01:15:27.899 --> 01:15:30.608
Of course
you don't remember.

1291
01:15:30.693 --> 01:15:32.309
And what a relief
that must be.

1292
01:15:32.403 --> 01:15:35.488
What a weight
off your shoulders.

1293
01:15:38.117 --> 01:15:40.484
I have to make a call.

1294
01:15:40.578 --> 01:15:43.412
But first.
you need to take these.

1295
01:15:43.498 --> 01:15:45.373
Are you sure?

1296
01:15:45.458 --> 01:15:47.375
You trust me. don't you?

1297
01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:49.752
After all
we've been through?

1298
01:15:55.635 --> 01:15:57.134
I'll be right back.

1299
01:16:02.976 --> 01:16:09.522
â™ª

1300
01:16:11.401 --> 01:16:14.068
(phone ringing)

1301
01:16:14.153 --> 01:16:15.352
Is it time?

1302
01:16:15.446 --> 01:16:18.188
It's time. Jesse.
Get them ready.

1303
01:16:18.283 --> 01:16:20.116
Madison'll be
on her way soon.

1304
01:16:20.201 --> 01:16:22.201
It's time
to make them pay.

1305
01:16:27.834 --> 01:16:36.173
â™ª

1306
01:16:51.190 --> 01:16:53.223
Dad. Where were you?

1307
01:16:53.318 --> 01:16:54.900
At the hospital with Arnold.

1308
01:16:55.028 --> 01:16:56.152
He--

1309
01:16:56.237 --> 01:16:58.112
I don't know where
to even start.

1310
01:16:58.197 --> 01:16:59.396
Is Arnold okay?

1311
01:16:59.490 --> 01:17:01.065
He's alive.

1312
01:17:01.159 --> 01:17:03.233
He's unconscious in the ICU.

1313
01:17:03.328 --> 01:17:04.577
He's holding on.
but at his age--

1314
01:17:04.704 --> 01:17:06.120
Where's Mom?

1315
01:17:06.205 --> 01:17:07.413
Does this have to do
with Nia?

1316
01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:09.123
Is somebody after us?

1317
01:17:09.208 --> 01:17:11.083
Honey. there's something
you need to know.

1318
01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:15.079
You might hear some...things.
About our family.

1319
01:17:15.173 --> 01:17:19.008
What-- what kind of things?

1320
01:17:19.093 --> 01:17:21.085
(knocking at door)

1321
01:17:21.179 --> 01:17:22.553
Oh. what the hell?

1322
01:17:24.515 --> 01:17:26.432
Yes? Do I know you?

1323
01:17:28.019 --> 01:17:30.019
Who are you supposed to be.
a trophy husband?

1324
01:17:30.104 --> 01:17:32.647
- What?
- (gun cocking)

1325
01:17:34.108 --> 01:17:35.358
Who are you
and what do you want?

1326
01:17:35.443 --> 01:17:36.359
Rebecca sent me.

1327
01:17:36.444 --> 01:17:38.361
Dad?

1328
01:17:40.573 --> 01:17:41.989
What do you want?

1329
01:17:42.075 --> 01:17:45.701
The three of us
are going to have a talk.

1330
01:17:45.787 --> 01:17:50.164
Take a seat
and get comfortable.

1331
01:18:02.428 --> 01:18:04.136
Emmett. I'm headed
to the lake house.

1332
01:18:04.263 --> 01:18:05.888
Call me back
when you get this.

1333
01:18:18.486 --> 01:18:20.111
Dad?

1334
01:18:23.449 --> 01:18:30.496
â™ª

1335
01:18:31.499 --> 01:18:33.666
Dad? Dad. are you okay?

1336
01:18:33.793 --> 01:18:35.543
- Madison?
- We have to go now.

1337
01:18:35.628 --> 01:18:36.961
Rebecca. she isn't
who we think she is.

1338
01:18:37.046 --> 01:18:38.838
Where is she?

1339
01:18:38.965 --> 01:18:41.257
Rebecca told me about you and
Arnold and your plans for me.

1340
01:18:41.342 --> 01:18:44.001
Rebecca attacked Arnold.
She's out to hurt us.

1341
01:18:44.095 --> 01:18:46.670
Ludicrous. She's been with me.
We've been here all summer.

1342
01:18:46.764 --> 01:18:49.056
She's poisoning your mind.
We have to go now.

1343
01:18:49.142 --> 01:18:50.641
How dare you?

1344
01:18:50.727 --> 01:18:52.476
I'm sick and tired of being
treated like an invalid.

1345
01:18:52.562 --> 01:18:54.562
Leave me alone. Let me go!

1346
01:18:54.647 --> 01:18:57.347
Dad. what happened to you?

1347
01:18:57.442 --> 01:18:59.150
How did she do this
to you?

1348
01:18:59.235 --> 01:19:01.068
By giving him
what he wanted.

1349
01:19:02.488 --> 01:19:04.405
What no one else could.

1350
01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:05.781
(thudding)

1351
01:19:23.301 --> 01:19:24.633
Madison:
What did you do to him?

1352
01:19:24.719 --> 01:19:26.761
He's barely breathing.

1353
01:19:26.846 --> 01:19:28.763
I might've given him
a bit too much.

1354
01:19:28.848 --> 01:19:32.099
You have no idea how hard it is
to eyeball this stuff

1355
01:19:32.185 --> 01:19:35.219
without a medical degree.

1356
01:19:35.313 --> 01:19:36.479
Isn't that right. Warren?

1357
01:19:36.564 --> 01:19:38.105
Leave him alone.

1358
01:19:38.191 --> 01:19:40.983
Your father and I
have an announcement to make.

1359
01:19:41.068 --> 01:19:42.693
He's reassigning
power of attorney

1360
01:19:42.779 --> 01:19:45.070
and appointing me
executor of his estate.

1361
01:19:45.198 --> 01:19:46.781
He's just not that happy

1362
01:19:46.866 --> 01:19:48.741
with the current state
of management.

1363
01:19:48.868 --> 01:19:50.034
You understand.

1364
01:19:50.119 --> 01:19:53.746
The only thing missing...

1365
01:19:53.873 --> 01:19:55.372
is your signature.

1366
01:19:58.544 --> 01:20:00.336
Is that my father's Crestview?

1367
01:20:03.174 --> 01:20:06.175
You were in his office.

1368
01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:08.219
It was you.

1369
01:20:08.304 --> 01:20:10.262
You killed Nia.

1370
01:20:10.389 --> 01:20:12.515
You're a murderer. Rebecca.
You're going to prison.

1371
01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:13.933
You're a monster.

1372
01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:15.309
And you're the one
who signs my checks.

1373
01:20:15.394 --> 01:20:17.594
You're insane.

1374
01:20:17.688 --> 01:20:20.231
You'll get laughed
out of court.

1375
01:20:20.316 --> 01:20:23.317
He's clearly in no position to
sign anything and neither am I.

1376
01:20:23.402 --> 01:20:27.029
You think you can convince the
banks. the board of directors?

1377
01:20:27.114 --> 01:20:29.281
They'll fight you
with resources you can't fathom.

1378
01:20:29.408 --> 01:20:32.201
They all have their weaknesses.
their vices.

1379
01:20:32.286 --> 01:20:34.036
their libidos.

1380
01:20:34.121 --> 01:20:36.247
You'd be amazed how persuasive
I can be.

1381
01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:39.166
with the right tools.
And besides.

1382
01:20:39.252 --> 01:20:42.753
who will be left to make a fuss
with you and Warren gone?

1383
01:20:42.839 --> 01:20:45.881
Just tell me the truth.
What did my father do to you?

1384
01:20:45.967 --> 01:20:49.793
Your father...
got very greedy.

1385
01:20:49.887 --> 01:20:52.054
Maddy.

1386
01:20:52.139 --> 01:20:53.514
He started making investments
on the side

1387
01:20:53.599 --> 01:20:56.267
using his clients' money.

1388
01:20:56.352 --> 01:20:59.603
He lost big. and he let
his clients take the fall.

1389
01:21:01.315 --> 01:21:04.859
One of those clients
was Mike Butler. my father.

1390
01:21:06.445 --> 01:21:08.979
He took losing everything
pretty hard.

1391
01:21:09.073 --> 01:21:11.448
Took it out on me and Jesse
for a while.

1392
01:21:11.534 --> 01:21:13.284
and took himself out
not long after that.

1393
01:21:13.369 --> 01:21:16.203
Dad. is that true?

1394
01:21:16.289 --> 01:21:17.830
Of course it's true!

1395
01:21:17.957 --> 01:21:19.623
It's all right here
in these ledger books.

1396
01:21:19.709 --> 01:21:22.877
I know my father made
some bad investment decisions.

1397
01:21:22.962 --> 01:21:25.880
but I never witnessed him
doing anything criminal.

1398
01:21:25.965 --> 01:21:27.172
You're a gullible fool.

1399
01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:30.092
What will any of this fix.
Rebecca?

1400
01:21:30.177 --> 01:21:31.927
Is it money you want?

1401
01:21:32.013 --> 01:21:34.221
Let's see if we can come
to an arrangement.

1402
01:21:34.307 --> 01:21:37.850
If it's true that my father
did what you said.

1403
01:21:37.977 --> 01:21:39.476
give me a chance
to make it up to you.

1404
01:21:39.562 --> 01:21:42.271
I lost my family.

1405
01:21:42.356 --> 01:21:45.015
My entire childhood.

1406
01:21:45.109 --> 01:21:47.017
How could you make that
up to me?

1407
01:21:47.111 --> 01:21:48.235
I lost everything
because of him.

1408
01:21:48.321 --> 01:21:50.237
and he can't even remember!

1409
01:21:50.323 --> 01:21:54.283
There's no making this up to me.
Madison.

1410
01:21:54.368 --> 01:21:56.118
No money can fix this.

1411
01:21:57.705 --> 01:21:59.455
Not anymore.

1412
01:22:01.959 --> 01:22:04.293
(phone ringing)

1413
01:22:04.378 --> 01:22:05.753
Put them on.

1414
01:22:07.965 --> 01:22:10.007
Jesse:
Smile.

1415
01:22:13.679 --> 01:22:15.721
(shallow breathing)

1416
01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:19.266
Now will you sign?

1417
01:22:19.352 --> 01:22:21.435
Or should I tell my brother
to shoot Hayley in the leg?

1418
01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:22.895
No!

1419
01:22:27.693 --> 01:22:30.069
She needs to be reminded
the stakes. Do it.

1420
01:22:30.196 --> 01:22:32.062
Wait. Stop. I'll sign.

1421
01:22:32.156 --> 01:22:35.658
Just-- let me see them again.
Let me see they're okay.

1422
01:22:35.743 --> 01:22:37.868
Hayley. honey.
are you all right?

1423
01:22:37.954 --> 01:22:39.203
I'm fine. Mom.

1424
01:22:39.288 --> 01:22:40.454
What's happening?
What do they want?

1425
01:22:40.539 --> 01:22:42.915
Everything's gonna be fine.
sweetie.

1426
01:22:43.042 --> 01:22:46.043
I just wanna tell you. you and
Emmett how much I love you.

1427
01:22:46.128 --> 01:22:48.629
I'm so sorry
I let this happen.

1428
01:22:48.714 --> 01:22:50.464
- We love you too. Mom.
- I love you. honey.

1429
01:22:50.549 --> 01:22:52.925
I promise.
everything's gonna be okay.

1430
01:22:54.345 --> 01:22:55.260
Sign.

1431
01:22:55.388 --> 01:22:58.180
I can't. My hands are tied.

1432
01:23:20.913 --> 01:23:29.962
â™ª

1433
01:23:30.089 --> 01:23:31.505
Now what. Rebecca?

1434
01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:34.791
Now you got what you want.
will you let me go?

1435
01:23:34.885 --> 01:23:36.760
You know I can't do that.

1436
01:23:36.846 --> 01:23:40.556
You know I can't
leave any witnesses.

1437
01:23:40.641 --> 01:23:42.599
You knew that
this whole time.

1438
01:23:45.896 --> 01:23:47.730
But this was never
a negotiation.

1439
01:23:47.815 --> 01:23:49.973
That's what separates us.
you and me.

1440
01:23:50.067 --> 01:23:54.403
I had my rose-colored glasses
slapped off my face years ago.

1441
01:23:57.283 --> 01:23:59.316
Please. think about
what you're doing.

1442
01:23:59.410 --> 01:24:01.151
Can you live with this
on your conscience?

1443
01:24:01.245 --> 01:24:05.247
That pathetic whining tone
reminds me of your mother.

1444
01:24:05.332 --> 01:24:08.083
just after I gave her
that lethal dose.

1445
01:24:08.169 --> 01:24:09.334
What?

1446
01:24:09.462 --> 01:24:11.170
Oh.
(chuckling)

1447
01:24:11.297 --> 01:24:13.380
The look on your face
right now.

1448
01:24:13.466 --> 01:24:15.674
Even Lockhart Investments
couldn't put a price on that.

1449
01:24:15.801 --> 01:24:18.635
No. You psychotic bitch!

1450
01:24:20.389 --> 01:24:22.389
Growing up the way I did.
Madison.

1451
01:24:22.475 --> 01:24:25.675
it made me hard.
It made me ruthless.

1452
01:24:25.770 --> 01:24:28.896
Willing to do whatever it takes
to get my seat at the table.

1453
01:24:28.981 --> 01:24:30.856
You'll never understand
that kind of work ethic.

1454
01:24:30.983 --> 01:24:33.776
You're nothing
but a spoiled child!

1455
01:24:33.861 --> 01:24:35.519
You could never run
an investment firm. Rebecca.

1456
01:24:35.613 --> 01:24:37.571
You don't know
what ruthless is.

1457
01:24:37.656 --> 01:24:38.614
(grunting)

1458
01:24:38.699 --> 01:24:39.990
Dad.

1459
01:24:41.327 --> 01:24:42.201
(thudding)

1460
01:24:42.328 --> 01:24:44.286
Jane!

1461
01:24:44.371 --> 01:24:45.412
(thudding)

1462
01:24:45.498 --> 01:24:46.413
(grunting)

1463
01:24:46.499 --> 01:24:48.290
Dad! Dad!

1464
01:24:50.002 --> 01:24:51.502
Who's the trophy husband now?

1465
01:24:58.344 --> 01:25:00.385
(breathing heavily)

1466
01:25:05.726 --> 01:25:07.476
Sometimes you gotta do
what you gotta do.

1467
01:25:10.231 --> 01:25:13.482
Hayley? Emmett?
Can you hear me?

1468
01:25:13.567 --> 01:25:16.360
Mom? Mom. we're okay!

1469
01:25:22.868 --> 01:25:24.827
I'm on my way home.

1470
01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:27.788
They're gonna be safe.

1471
01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:51.603
Grandpa.
(chuckling)

1472
01:25:53.399 --> 01:25:54.982
You two doin' good?

1473
01:25:55.067 --> 01:25:56.316
Did the police run out
of questions?

1474
01:25:56.402 --> 01:25:58.861
Dr. Lund give your dad
the all-clear?

1475
01:25:58.946 --> 01:25:59.945
For now. How 'bout you?

1476
01:26:00.072 --> 01:26:01.488
How's your forehead?

1477
01:26:01.574 --> 01:26:03.240
Oh. it's nothin'.
Just a bump.

1478
01:26:04.243 --> 01:26:07.369
By the way...

1479
01:26:07.454 --> 01:26:09.580
look at what I found.

1480
01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:13.458
Dad. are you okay?

1481
01:26:22.094 --> 01:26:24.428
I had the most
wonderful dream.

1482
01:26:24.513 --> 01:26:26.638
We were all
back together again.

1483
01:26:26.765 --> 01:26:27.973
At the lake house.

1484
01:26:30.102 --> 01:26:32.144
Come on. let's go inside.

1485
01:26:34.273 --> 01:26:36.273
What happens now. Mom?

1486
01:26:36.358 --> 01:26:38.066
Now we work
to make things right.

1487
01:26:48.287 --> 01:26:58.253

1488
01:27:09.475 --> 01:27:19.441
