(door closing)

00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:32.072
Hello. Ruth.

6
00:00:34.618 --> 00:00:37.486
Oh. You're not Irene.

7
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.039
I had an awful night
last night.

8
00:00:40.124 --> 00:00:43.992
My husband. I kept him up
until morning.

9
00:00:44.086 --> 00:00:47.171
I hate to do that.

10
00:00:47.298 --> 00:00:49.465
Warren has
his own troubles.

11
00:00:52.803 --> 00:00:55.220
Is this something new?

12
00:00:55.306 --> 00:00:56.680
Nurse:
That's right.

13
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.975
Irene didn't say anything.

14
00:01:00.061 --> 00:01:02.686
And you finally
found something

15
00:01:02.813 --> 00:01:04.313
that would help me
keep my food down.

16
00:01:04.398 --> 00:01:07.483
You would think this place
would improve the menu.

17
00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:10.235
considering my family
paid for this wing.

18
00:01:16.994 --> 00:01:18.577
I forget
what your name was.

19
00:01:21.332 --> 00:01:23.040
Wait. wait.

20
00:01:23.167 --> 00:01:26.210
- Wait. who are you?
- A friend. Ruth. An old friend.

21
00:01:26.337 --> 00:01:29.254
I don't feel very well.

22
00:01:30.674 --> 00:01:33.550
Uh-- uh-- I think
I'm having a reaction.

23
00:01:33.677 --> 00:01:36.011

Ms. Lockhart?

27
00:02:10.214 --> 00:02:14.299
Madison? I'm so sorry
to hear about your mother.

28
00:02:14.385 --> 00:02:15.759
She was a. uh--

29
00:02:15.886 --> 00:02:18.554
a formidable woman.

30
00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:19.972
Should I check
on your father?

31
00:02:21.892 --> 00:02:23.892
No. Gregory. I'll go.

32
00:02:23.978 --> 00:02:26.103
Hayley. honey. will you be okay
if I check on your grandpa?

33
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.604
Sure. Mom.

34
00:02:37.074 --> 00:02:38.323
How are you holding up.
Dad?

35
00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.534
She was so beautiful.
Madison.

36
00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:42.911
We were so happy together.

37
00:02:42.997 --> 00:02:45.664
Those summers
at the lake house

38
00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:48.542
were some of the best memories
I have.

39
00:02:48.627 --> 00:02:50.169
The best any kid would have.

40
00:02:50.254 --> 00:02:53.380
If I'd known
that last summer

41
00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:56.133
would be our final summer
together--

42
00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.303
I'm so sorry. Grandpa.

43
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.139
Thank you. Hayley.

44
00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:04.850
- Oh.
- God! Now look what I've done!

45
00:03:04.935 --> 00:03:06.560
It's okay. Dad. It's okay.

46
00:03:08.647 --> 00:03:10.731
I've got it. Don't worry.

47
00:03:10.816 --> 00:03:13.150
Thank you. Gregory. I don't know
what we'd do without you.

48
00:03:17.948 --> 00:03:20.148
Well. how's the caviar.
Emmett?

49
00:03:20.242 --> 00:03:21.742
It's from the Caspian.

50
00:03:21.827 --> 00:03:22.993
It was Ruth's favorite.

51
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.986
Is that what this is?

52
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.496
I thought it was raspberry jam
on a cracker.

53
00:03:26.624 --> 00:03:29.208
(chuckling)

54
00:03:29.293 --> 00:03:31.326
You know. I introduced
Warren and Ruth.

55
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.837
Not that I didn't have
my regrets afterwards.

56
00:03:33.964 --> 00:03:35.380
She was so stunning.

57
00:03:35.466 --> 00:03:39.343
I didn't have the courage
to ask her out myself.

58
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.221
Now. Warren. though.
he wasn't afraid of anything.

59
00:03:42.306 --> 00:03:44.389
Not back then.

60
00:03:44.475 --> 00:03:45.766
One of the bravest men
I've ever known.

61
00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:47.517
Agreed.

62
00:03:48.771 --> 00:03:49.895
How's Madison doing?

63
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.438
Well. you know Madison.

64
00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:54.349
No matter what's happening.

65
00:03:54.443 --> 00:03:55.692
she's as strong
as a Sherman tank.

66
00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.569
Did I hear my name?

67
00:03:57.655 --> 00:03:59.854
Yeah. baby.

68
00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:03.116
Hello. Madison. We were just
estimating your resistance

69
00:04:03.202 --> 00:04:05.035
to armor-piercing rounds.

70
00:04:05.162 --> 00:04:07.162
Hmm.

71
00:04:07.248 --> 00:04:10.699
I have to admit. I'm not feeling
so bullet-proof today.

72
00:04:10.793 --> 00:04:12.668
Aw. baby.

73
00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:14.378
Who was that
helping your father?

74
00:04:14.505 --> 00:04:16.713
Was it another cousin
I haven't met?

75
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.708
Oh. that's Gregory.
my dad's assistant.

76
00:04:19.802 --> 00:04:21.543
I didn't know
he had one.

77
00:04:21.637 --> 00:04:23.303
I arranged it
after my dad's last fall.

78
00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.390
I was worried my mom
was expending too much energy

79
00:04:26.517 --> 00:04:28.225
looking after him.

80
00:04:28.352 --> 00:04:31.061
(sighing) Madison. speaking
of unnecessary expenditures.

81
00:04:31.188 --> 00:04:33.605
we need to have a heart-to-heart
about the state of the firm.

82

Arnold. you're like family
and I love you dearly.

- I'm okay.

90
00:05:04.722 --> 00:05:08.015
Actually.
I feel kinda numb.

91
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.643
I'd like to think
my mom and I were at peace.

92
00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:13.595
I don't wanna add
to your day.

93
00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:15.981

to arrange a meeting.

94
00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:17.899
Mm-hm.
Schedule it for Monday.

some time off

96
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.403
to process all this?

97
00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:25.449
You mean cry.
let it all out?

98
00:05:25.576 --> 00:05:28.035
My father's gonna be all alone
in this great big house

for the first time
since forever.

100
00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:32.447
He needs a rock.
not a sponge.

101
00:05:32.541 --> 00:05:34.207
Sorry to interrupt.

102
00:05:34.293 --> 00:05:36.043
There's somebody here
to see you. Maddy.

103
00:05:36.128 --> 00:05:38.420
You and your dad.

104
00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:40.088
That's my cue.

105
00:05:42.843 --> 00:05:44.593
Come on.

106
00:05:50.934 --> 00:05:53.685
Hi. I'm Madison Lockhart.

107
00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:55.470
Are you here
for the reception?

108
00:05:55.564 --> 00:05:58.139
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean
to pull you away.

109
00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:00.609
I just wanted to drop by
and extend my condolences.

110
00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:02.736
Rebecca Wilson.

111
00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:05.447
- This is my husband Emmett.
- Emmett: Hi. nice to meet you.

112
00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:08.283
Thank you.
These are beautiful.

113
00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:12.204
I was. um.
one of Ruth's nurses.

114
00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:14.039
I like to think
that we were friends.

115
00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:15.490

Excuse me.
Do you mind holding that?

118
00:06:19.963 --> 00:06:21.380
Warren:
Not again!

119
00:06:23.467 --> 00:06:26.093
It was just an accident.
Here. I'll take that. Thank you.

120
00:06:27.346 --> 00:06:28.670
I am so sorry about this.

121
00:06:28.764 --> 00:06:30.263
We had a bit
of a misunderstanding

122
00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:32.224
with the catering crew.

123
00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:33.975
I told them
to get out of here.

124
00:06:34.061 --> 00:06:36.228
What the hell are all these
people doing in my house?

125
00:06:36.313 --> 00:06:39.514
Dad. these people are here
to pay their respects.

126
00:06:39.608 --> 00:06:41.516
They're here for Mom's wake.

127
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.693
Ruth?
What happened to Ruth?

128
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:48.031
Dad. Mom passed away
three days ago.

129
00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:49.524
Don't you remember?

130
00:06:49.618 --> 00:06:50.859
(wheezing)

131
00:06:50.953 --> 00:06:53.578
Dad. are you okay?
Are you okay. Dad?

132
00:06:53.664 --> 00:06:55.080
Can someone call an ambulance.
please?

133
00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:56.865
(coughing)

134
00:06:56.959 --> 00:06:59.668
Warren? Warren. my name is
Rebecca. okay? I'm a nurse.

135
00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:01.369
Listen to me. I know there's
a lot going on right now

136
00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:02.712
but I need you
to breathe with me.

137
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.048
Do you think
you can do that?

138
00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:06.550
One. two.

139
00:07:06.677 --> 00:07:08.885
- Okay. okay. good. In?
- (breathing slowing)

140
00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:11.221
--two. three.
Perfect. Now out.

141
00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:14.883
That's it! Very good. very good.
Just breathe.

142
00:07:14.977 --> 00:07:16.101
Everything's gonna be okay.

143
00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:19.229
Everything's
gonna be all right.

144
00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:21.940
(labored breathing)

145
00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:24.901
He's barely past
retirement age.

146
00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:27.696
He's only 67.

147
00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:30.449
He's had his memory issues
but I never--

148
00:07:30.534 --> 00:07:33.577
Early onset dementia?

149
00:07:33.704 --> 00:07:35.412
It's likely lain dormant.

150
00:07:35.539 --> 00:07:37.831
triggered by the stress
of the past few days.

151
00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:40.792
We need to run
a few more tests.

152
00:07:40.878 --> 00:07:42.335
So. what happens next?

153
00:07:42.421 --> 00:07:45.413
There's a rough timeline
we can expect to follow.

154
00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:48.592
His ability to make decisions
will continue to decline.

155
00:07:48.719 --> 00:07:51.511
Basic daily tasks
will become challenging

156
00:07:51.597 --> 00:07:54.422
and then almost impossible.

157
00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:57.392
Eventually he'll rely on others
completely for his care.

158
00:07:57.478 --> 00:08:00.020
You'll wanna start planning
before that time comes

159
00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:02.814
and arrange a transfer
of power of attorney.

160
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.816
All of this will only become
harder to implement

161
00:08:04.902 --> 00:08:06.443
the more time passes.

162
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.653
I'm truly very sorry.

163
00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:28.340
(sighing)
He's asleep for now.

164
00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:30.291
Gregory. you've done enough
for today.

165
00:08:30.385 --> 00:08:31.718
Thank you so much.

166
00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:34.462
It's almost 10:00.
You must be exhausted.

167
00:08:34.556 --> 00:08:36.640
It's no problem.
I'm happy to do it.

168
00:08:36.767 --> 00:08:40.060
Has anyone seen Hayley?

169
00:08:40.145 --> 00:08:41.811
(woman giggling)

170
00:08:44.775 --> 00:08:46.149
Oh.

171
00:08:48.946 --> 00:08:51.363
(giggling)

172
00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:54.866
Rebecca?
You're still here.

173
00:08:54.952 --> 00:08:57.202
I thought
we sent everyone home.

174
00:08:57.287 --> 00:09:00.497
I was uh. about to go and I saw
some caterers ducking out.

175
00:09:00.624 --> 00:09:02.490
There was still so much
left to clean.

176
00:09:02.584 --> 00:09:04.042
One dish led to another. and--

177
00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:06.044
Anyway. I should go.

178
00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:08.213
No. no. you don't have to go.
Rebecca.

179
00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:10.331
My mom's not being
very hospitable.

180
00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:13.843
Wait. Rebecca. I'm sorry.
It's just been a very long day.

181
00:09:13.971 --> 00:09:15.804
Thank you so much
for staying back and helping.

182
00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:18.598
Of course.
Oh! Uh. by the way.

183
00:09:18.684 --> 00:09:20.350
I fixed up
a late night snack.

184
00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:23.228
I figured by the time
you got back.

185
00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:24.604
you'd both be pretty starving.

186
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:26.514
Wow. Thank you.

187
00:09:26.608 --> 00:09:28.358
Wait. you're not staying
to try some?

188
00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:30.151
That took us
like two hours to make.

189
00:09:30.237 --> 00:09:32.612
Unfortunately I've got a big day
of job hunting tomorrow.

190
00:09:32.698 --> 00:09:35.198
You're not at the hospital
anymore?

191
00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:38.285
Sadly no. I was just filling in
for someone on maternity leave.

192
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.029
I'm really happy that Warren's
doing so much better.

193
00:09:41.123 --> 00:09:42.706
I left my phone number
in case you need anything.

194
00:09:42.833 --> 00:09:43.790
Anything at all.

195
00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:46.668
- Thank you.
- Of course.

196
00:09:49.673 --> 00:09:51.372
She's so cool. Mom.

197
00:09:51.466 --> 00:09:53.967
She's like Mary Poppins
without the accent.

198
00:09:58.015 --> 00:10:06.563
♪

199
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.607
Thought you were popping in
to gloat.

200
00:10:08.692 --> 00:10:11.392
I've been here six hours.

201
00:10:11.486 --> 00:10:13.153
You've barely been out
a month. Jesse.

202
00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:16.448
and you're already complaining
about having too much free time?

203
00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:18.566
I saw an opening.

204
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.327
I couldn't pass up the chance
to look around.

205
00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:24.289
So? You found it?

206
00:10:24.374 --> 00:10:26.240
No. Not yet.

207
00:10:26.335 --> 00:10:29.669
I'll need more time.
and opportunity.

208
00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:33.673
Bingo.

209
00:10:43.018 --> 00:10:46.427
Barely had a chance
to grieve for Mom. Emmett.

210
00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:47.979
Now this?

211
00:10:48.065 --> 00:10:51.316
Honey. I can stay with your dad
if he'll have me.

212
00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:53.101
Gregory can look after him
tomorrow during the day.

213
00:10:53.195 --> 00:10:54.986
Honey. I can't ask you
to do that.

214
00:10:55.072 --> 00:10:56.938
I know you're swamped
at the gallery.

215
00:10:57.032 --> 00:10:58.823
We don't know how long
it's gonna take

216
00:10:58.909 --> 00:11:00.450
to find him proper care.

217
00:11:00.577 --> 00:11:02.110
Warren:
I am not leaving this house.

218
00:11:02.204 --> 00:11:04.829
Dad. what are you doing up?

219
00:11:04.915 --> 00:11:06.447
I have Gregory.
He's more than enough.

220
00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:08.833
Dad. Gregory's
just a personal aide.

221
00:11:08.919 --> 00:11:10.785
He's not qualified to deal
with this kind of thing.

222
00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:13.088
I'm not getting placed
into a home.

223
00:11:16.593 --> 00:11:18.802
Of course not. Dad.

224
00:11:18.929 --> 00:11:21.012
I hear you.

225
00:11:21.098 --> 00:11:23.932
I'm listening.
We'll figure something out.

226
00:11:25.435 --> 00:11:27.769
I promise
you don't have to leave.

227
00:11:33.235 --> 00:11:35.944
Gregory. right?

228
00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:38.488
Rebecca?

229
00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:41.658
Hi! You come here too?

230
00:11:41.785 --> 00:11:44.318
After a day like today.
you bet I do.

231
00:11:44.413 --> 00:11:46.579
Two more
of what he's having?

232
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.333
So. how long
have you been working

233
00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.169
for the infamous
Lockhart family?

234
00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:55.964
Not long. Madison--
Ms. Lockhart--

235
00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:58.174
she just hired me
a few months ago.

236
00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:00.093
They've been good to me.

237
00:12:00.178 --> 00:12:02.837
Why do you call them
"infamous"?

238
00:12:02.931 --> 00:12:04.672
Oh. you know what they say.

239
00:12:04.766 --> 00:12:07.058
Behind every great fortune
is a crime.

240
00:12:07.144 --> 00:12:10.812
Oh. Where is that from? I feel
like I've heard it before.

241
00:12:15.152 --> 00:12:16.526
(coughing)

242
00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:21.448
How about you buy me
another one?

243
00:12:23.827 --> 00:12:25.243
Hey.

244
00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:32.250
Well. this is it.

245
00:12:48.643 --> 00:12:50.718
I've never done this before.

246
00:12:50.812 --> 00:12:52.479
(chuckling)

247
00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:04.491
There's a first time
for everything.

248
00:13:14.044 --> 00:13:15.919
Stop! What are you doing?

249
00:13:16.046 --> 00:13:20.298
You just received
a powerful dose of temazepam.

250
00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:23.968
You should be comatose or worse
in about 78 seconds.

251
00:13:24.054 --> 00:13:27.055
Don't worry.
It's completely undetectable.

252
00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:30.517
Your loved ones will just think
your heart popped.

253
00:13:30.602 --> 00:13:33.812
No one'll have to know
how much you suffered first--

254
00:13:33.897 --> 00:13:35.647
just you and me.

255
00:13:35.732 --> 00:13:38.099
Unless I inject you
with this.

256
00:13:38.193 --> 00:13:39.984
What-- what do you want?

257
00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:42.779
Tell me where Warren Lockhart's
files are.

258
00:13:42.906 --> 00:13:44.322
I know they're somewhere
in that house.

259
00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:47.116
In his study. in a locked
drawer. in a safe maybe?

260
00:13:47.244 --> 00:13:48.785
I-- I have no idea.

261
00:13:48.912 --> 00:13:51.287
Please. I'm just
a personal assistant!

262
00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:54.115
I don't know anything
about any safe!

263
00:13:54.209 --> 00:13:56.459
Oh. okay.

264
00:13:56.586 --> 00:14:00.288
I believe you. I do.

265
00:14:00.382 --> 00:14:04.175
It's just--
you're still in the way.

266
00:14:04.261 --> 00:14:05.635
You still need to go.

267
00:14:19.943 --> 00:14:29.826
♪

268
00:14:35.959 --> 00:14:45.842
♪

269
00:14:51.474 --> 00:14:52.891
Nia: Must feel strange
sitting in that chair.

270
00:14:52.976 --> 00:14:55.560
His chair.

271
00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:57.061
Madison: I wasn't sure
I ever wanted this.

272
00:14:57.147 --> 00:15:00.014
Taking over
the family business?

273
00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:04.319
I thought I was happy working
three doors down the hall.

274
00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:06.404
Well. if there's one lesson
I've learned

275
00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:08.489
after ten years of arranging
people's schedules.

276
00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:11.910
it's that life rarely
suits our timelines.

277
00:15:11.995 --> 00:15:13.161
Arnold's here.

278
00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:14.996
For that meeting?

279
00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:18.958
(sighing)
Bring him in. please.

280
00:15:21.338 --> 00:15:23.871
- She's ready.
- Thank you. Nia.

281
00:15:23.965 --> 00:15:25.373
Madison.

282
00:15:25.467 --> 00:15:27.375
How's Warren holding up?

283
00:15:27.469 --> 00:15:30.762
As best can be expected.
under the circumstances.

284
00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:33.431
He's angry.
he's frustrated.

285
00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:35.224
Quite frankly.
he's scared out of his wits.

286
00:15:35.352 --> 00:15:38.886
To see him reduced to this.

287
00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.606
You said it was urgent
that we speak.

288
00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:45.902
Before his retirement...

289
00:15:46.029 --> 00:15:50.490
Warren made a number of
bad investments. as you know.

290
00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:55.912
I have tried to stop
the bleeding as best I could.

291
00:15:56.039 --> 00:15:59.415
but... I think
we need to sell.

292
00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:01.542
(inhaling)

293
00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:10.510
My father bought this pen

294
00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:12.637
when he signed
his first contract.

295
00:16:12.722 --> 00:16:15.923
(unclear) pen is maybe the first
thing he bought for his job.

296
00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:17.767
He's used it to sign
every contract

297
00:16:17.894 --> 00:16:20.061
that's crossed his desk since.

298
00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:23.439
Now you're asking me to sign off
on ending his legacy.

299
00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:27.360
We faced this before.
We can push through again.

300
00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:34.158
Perhaps. But my advice as CFO
is to sell now.

301
00:16:34.244 --> 00:16:37.611
while the Lockhart family name
retains its value.

302
00:16:37.706 --> 00:16:40.289
Thank you. Arnold.
I'll take it under advisement.

303
00:16:40.417 --> 00:16:43.117
Madison. time is
of the essence.

304
00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:44.961
I just finished
burying my mother.

305
00:16:45.088 --> 00:16:47.621
Now you're asking me to sign
away my family birthright.

306
00:16:47.716 --> 00:16:49.465
I said I'll consider it.

307
00:16:56.975 --> 00:16:59.350
Listen to me.

308
00:16:59.436 --> 00:17:02.470
Warren has been my best friend
and my mentor for 35 years.

309
00:17:02.564 --> 00:17:07.025
I would never do anything
but protect him. and his family.

310
00:17:08.903 --> 00:17:10.611
The Lockhart legacy
is a lot more

311
00:17:10.697 --> 00:17:12.780
than a name
on a building to me.

312
00:17:12.866 --> 00:17:14.949
For all of us.

313
00:17:24.794 --> 00:17:27.170
What do you think?
Is he right?

314
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.424
I suppose it all depends
on what happens next.

315
00:17:31.509 --> 00:17:34.010
You mean it depends on me.

316
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.721
(phone notification dinging)

317
00:17:49.652 --> 00:17:51.685
- What is it? Is Dad okay?
- Your dad's fine.

318
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.739
He's in bed reading the paper.
It's just--

319
00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:56.657
Gregory didn't show up
this morning.

320
00:17:56.743 --> 00:17:59.744
Really?
He's been so dependable.

321
00:17:59.829 --> 00:18:01.245
Dad hasn't eaten yet?

322
00:18:01.331 --> 00:18:03.581
No.

323
00:18:03.666 --> 00:18:05.249
Thank you.
I'll take this up.

324
00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:13.424
Morning. Dad.

325
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:16.094
I brought you breakfast.

326
00:18:16.179 --> 00:18:17.378
How you feeling?

327
00:18:17.472 --> 00:18:20.640
Fine. fine.
Where's Gregory?

328
00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:22.058
He didn't show up.

329
00:18:22.185 --> 00:18:24.268
We've been calling him
all morning.

330
00:18:24.354 --> 00:18:26.887
Warren:
That doesn't sound like Gregory.

331
00:18:26.981 --> 00:18:29.690
Dad. there's something I wanted
to talk to you about.

332
00:18:29.776 --> 00:18:31.567
I spoke to Arnold
this morning.

333
00:18:31.694 --> 00:18:33.444
Let me guess.
He wants you to sell.

334
00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.613
That's exactly
what he said.

335
00:18:35.698 --> 00:18:37.565
I knew he was
up to something.

336
00:18:37.659 --> 00:18:39.909
Sell the company that my father
built from the ground up

337
00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:42.036
from nothing
but his two bare hands?

338
00:18:42.122 --> 00:18:44.247
Dad. Arnold's been
our family accountant

339
00:18:44.374 --> 00:18:45.873
since before I was born.

340
00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:47.750
He's always
looked out for us.

341
00:18:47.877 --> 00:18:50.837
If he truly thinks it's the
right decision to sell. then--

342
00:18:50.922 --> 00:18:54.006
That guy's stealing from me.
I can't find my watch.

343
00:18:54.092 --> 00:18:57.093
The one Ruth gave me
on our anniversary.

344
00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.387
Why would Arnold
steal your watch?

345
00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:07.436
Look.

346
00:19:07.564 --> 00:19:09.230
Here it is.
safe and sound.

347
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:13.601
(sighing)

348
00:19:13.695 --> 00:19:16.154
(phone ringing)

349
00:19:18.283 --> 00:19:20.741
Hello?
Madison Lockhart speaking.

350
00:19:22.537 --> 00:19:23.703
Okay.

351
00:19:23.788 --> 00:19:26.539
Oh. Okay.

352
00:19:28.418 --> 00:19:30.084
- Thank you.
- What is it?

353
00:19:31.421 --> 00:19:33.296
Who was that?

354
00:19:33.423 --> 00:19:36.090
Gregory won't be
coming in today.

355
00:19:36.176 --> 00:19:37.633
I'll see if Emmett
can take the day off.

356
00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.135
I don't want Emmett.

357
00:19:39.262 --> 00:19:41.929
I've got you. I've got Hayley.
I've got Ruth.

358
00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:43.306
Dad.

359
00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:45.641
Mom-- she's--

360
00:19:47.645 --> 00:19:49.854
You just eat.
I'll be downstairs.

361
00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:55.568
The police just called.

362
00:19:55.653 --> 00:19:59.322
Gregory was found unconscious
inside his apartment.

363
00:19:59.449 --> 00:20:01.315
They think
it was a drug overdose.

364
00:20:01.409 --> 00:20:03.993
He's in a medically
induced coma.

365
00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.162
An overdose?

366
00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:07.830
He didn't seem the type.

367
00:20:09.626 --> 00:20:12.168
I don't know how much longer
I can keep this up. Emmett.

368
00:20:12.295 --> 00:20:13.669
I can't keep breaking it to Dad
that Mom died.

369
00:20:13.796 --> 00:20:16.214
It's gut-wrenching.

370
00:20:16.299 --> 00:20:18.999
Dad thinks that Arnold's
stealing from him.

371
00:20:19.093 --> 00:20:20.551
Arnold?

372
00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:23.554
Is there any chance
you could look after Dad

373
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.765
for the rest of the day? I have
to get back to the office.

374
00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:27.841
Honey. you know how busy I am
with work right now.

375
00:20:27.936 --> 00:20:29.510
We need more than
a Band-Aid for this.

376
00:20:29.604 --> 00:20:31.145
We need to find
a long-term solution.

377
00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:32.688
What about Rebecca Wilson?

378
00:20:32.815 --> 00:20:35.349
She was great with Warren
the other day.

379
00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:38.686
We don't even know
if she's qualified.

380
00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.863
We're talking about
some specialized care here.

381
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.782
Would it hurt
to look at her resume?

382
00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:44.784
I don't know.

383
00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:46.035
She's still a stranger.

384
00:20:46.162 --> 00:20:48.696
Honey. I like her.

385
00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:52.124
Hayley likes her.
your dad likes her.

386
00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:56.045
Besides...she knew your mom.

387
00:21:09.644 --> 00:21:11.477
Where the hell
did they hide you?

388
00:21:11.562 --> 00:21:13.813

389
00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:18.567
Hello?
Rebecca Wilson speaking.

390
00:21:18.695 --> 00:21:20.736
Hi. Rebecca.
It's Madison Lockhart.

391
00:21:20.863 --> 00:21:22.488
Do you have a minute?

392
00:21:22.573 --> 00:21:24.398
Of course. Madison.
Is everything all right?

393
00:21:24.492 --> 00:21:25.700
How's Warren doing?

394
00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:27.568
To be honest. not so well.

395
00:21:27.662 --> 00:21:29.245
I was hoping
you might have some time

396
00:21:29.372 --> 00:21:31.914
to come by the house tomorrow
to discuss a job proposal?

397
00:21:32.041 --> 00:21:34.333
I'd be happy to. Madison.

398
00:21:34.419 --> 00:21:36.076
How's 7:30AM?

399
00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:37.795
That sounds great.

400
00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.839
Thanks. Rebecca.
We'll see you tomorrow.

401
00:21:49.309 --> 00:21:50.924
It's all coming together.
Jesse.

402
00:21:51.019 --> 00:21:53.436
We're finally getting back
what's ours.

403
00:22:15.793 --> 00:22:18.627
Madison: So. how do you see
this all working. Rebecca?

404
00:22:18.755 --> 00:22:20.046
I'm gonna have to rely
on your expertise.

405
00:22:20.131 --> 00:22:22.506
Of course.
Well. first and foremost.

406
00:22:22.592 --> 00:22:24.550
I'll act as point person
between you. Warren.

407
00:22:24.635 --> 00:22:25.793
and the hospital.

408
00:22:25.887 --> 00:22:27.803
So. tracking
all of his progress.

409
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:29.463
sharing that
with his doctors.

410
00:22:29.557 --> 00:22:31.223
taking him to all
of his appointments.

411
00:22:31.309 --> 00:22:33.684
Really just sparing you
all that shop talk.

412
00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:35.469
Madison:
And what about meals?

413
00:22:35.563 --> 00:22:38.189
Ah. nutrition is
of vital importance.

414
00:22:38.274 --> 00:22:40.274
I took the liberty of developing
a daily meal plan

415
00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.651
based on Warren's age.
height. and weight.

416
00:22:42.779 --> 00:22:46.280
A healthy diet. regular
exercise. and mental stimulation

417
00:22:46.366 --> 00:22:49.200
is key to slowing down
any sort of cognitive decline.

418
00:22:49.285 --> 00:22:51.535
And of course. a walk
in the park every now and then

419
00:22:51.621 --> 00:22:53.204
doesn't hurt either.

420
00:22:53.289 --> 00:22:55.706
Great! This all looks terrific.

421
00:22:55.792 --> 00:22:57.375
I'm gonna verify
the references

422
00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.710
and hopefully you can get
started in a few days.

423
00:22:59.796 --> 00:23:01.253
(phone ringing)

424
00:23:01.339 --> 00:23:03.255
Um. excuse me.

425
00:23:07.929 --> 00:23:10.471
Mm-hm?

426
00:23:10.556 --> 00:23:12.014
Okay.

427
00:23:13.476 --> 00:23:16.727
That was work. I have to
get back to the office.

428
00:23:18.356 --> 00:23:22.733
Oh. But I told Emmett I would
take care of Dad today.

429
00:23:22.819 --> 00:23:24.944
Oh. Well. uh. this might
seem impetuous.

430
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:26.612
but given the circumstances.

431
00:23:26.697 --> 00:23:29.490
I'd be more than happy
to start now. if it'd help.

432
00:23:29.575 --> 00:23:32.576
Thank you. Yes.

433
00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:38.198
I left instructions on how
to reach me in an emergency.

434
00:23:38.292 --> 00:23:40.033
but I'll have my phone on me
all day.

435
00:23:40.128 --> 00:23:41.627
And the keys are by the door.

436
00:23:41.712 --> 00:23:44.755
My dad's meds are in the cabinet
in the master bedroom.

437
00:23:44.841 --> 00:23:47.049
He takes them
after every meal.

438
00:23:47.176 --> 00:23:48.717
but I've already given him
his morning pills.

439
00:23:48.845 --> 00:23:50.428
They tend to make him
a little sleepy.

440
00:23:50.513 --> 00:23:52.221
so he's just been going
back to bed.

441
00:23:52.348 --> 00:23:54.181
Madison. you have nothing
to worry about.

442
00:23:54.267 --> 00:23:56.884
Warren and I
will be just fine.

443
00:23:56.978 --> 00:23:58.602
I'm so sorry.
but I really have to get going.

444
00:23:58.688 --> 00:24:00.938
Oh yeah. no. go.
Go to work.

Oh my God.
oh my God. oh my God.

527
00:30:51.225 --> 00:30:52.808
Oh. no.

528
00:31:14.456 --> 00:31:15.488
Hayley?

529
00:31:15.583 --> 00:31:18.158
- Rebecca.
- Are you okay?

530
00:31:18.252 --> 00:31:20.660
Oh. God.
I thought you were my mom.

531
00:31:20.754 --> 00:31:25.340
- She's gonna kill me.
- Tell me what happened.

532
00:31:25.467 --> 00:31:28.501
Some friends
threw a party after school

533
00:31:28.596 --> 00:31:30.003
and we needed a way
to get there.

534
00:31:30.097 --> 00:31:32.723
so I borrowed Grandpa's car.

535
00:31:32.808 --> 00:31:37.185
and Penelope had
this punch. and--

536
00:31:37.313 --> 00:31:38.770
I felt woozy driving home

537
00:31:38.856 --> 00:31:42.515
and I tried to park it back
and the steering locked.

538
00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:44.902
And Mom's gonna
totally disown me.

539
00:31:44.987 --> 00:31:46.737
Hayley. I've got this.

540
00:31:46.822 --> 00:31:49.406
Gimme the keys and meet me
back inside.

541
00:31:49.491 --> 00:31:52.701
But how? That guy over there
saw the whole thing.

542
00:31:55.372 --> 00:31:57.331
Wait here.
I'll be right back.

543
00:32:00.502 --> 00:32:07.466
♪

544
00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:17.476
- What did you say to him?
- (sighing)

545
00:32:17.561 --> 00:32:21.438
Hayley. You are a Lockhart.

546
00:32:21.523 --> 00:32:24.107
You might not know it now.

547
00:32:24.193 --> 00:32:26.693
but that name holds power
in this world.

548
00:32:26.779 --> 00:32:28.111
It's currency.

549
00:32:28.197 --> 00:32:29.396
It's a big. flashing sign

550
00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:31.239
telling people.
"Money lives here.

551
00:32:31.367 --> 00:32:32.991
"Mess with it at your peril."

552
00:32:33.077 --> 00:32:37.120
It makes ordinary guys like him
think twice about paperwork.

553
00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:40.374
I don't know
how to thank you.

554
00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:45.462
No need to thank me.
You owe me.

555
00:32:45.547 --> 00:32:47.381
Now let's get you inside
so you can sleep this off?

556
00:32:47.466 --> 00:32:48.966
Yeah.

557
00:33:02.856 --> 00:33:04.147
(car locks chirping outside)

558
00:33:19.081 --> 00:33:20.447
- Hi. Rebecca.
- Hi.

559
00:33:20.541 --> 00:33:22.541
Sorry I'm running so late.

560
00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:27.796
Did something happen here?

561
00:33:27.923 --> 00:33:29.622
Rebecca:
Oh. (nervous chuckling)

562
00:33:29.717 --> 00:33:32.551
There was a bit of a distraction
concerning a certain watch.

563
00:33:32.636 --> 00:33:34.511
We kinda turned the place
upside-down looking for it.

564
00:33:34.596 --> 00:33:38.807
Warren insisted
we search everywhere.

565
00:33:38.934 --> 00:33:40.967
My dad did all this?

566
00:33:41.061 --> 00:33:43.603
Yeah. It's a symptom
of the disease.

567
00:33:43.689 --> 00:33:46.023
Sadly.

568
00:33:46.108 --> 00:33:48.141
An irrational attachment
to misplaced valuables.

569
00:33:48.235 --> 00:33:50.444
But the good news is
he's a lot calmer now.

570
00:33:50.529 --> 00:33:52.029
Well. that's good.
Where is he?

571
00:33:52.114 --> 00:33:54.147
Oh. he's just resting upstairs.

572
00:33:54.241 --> 00:33:56.533
You know. we had quite
an active day. to say the least.

573
00:33:56.618 --> 00:34:00.653
Thank you. Rebecca. for stepping
in on such last-minute notice.

574
00:34:00.748 --> 00:34:03.707
Oh yeah. of course!
It's my pleasure.

575
00:34:03.792 --> 00:34:05.492
There is one other
little item.

576
00:34:05.586 --> 00:34:08.328
Warren asked me
to move his car

577
00:34:08.422 --> 00:34:10.881
and I sort of grazed
the lamp post by accident

578
00:34:10.966 --> 00:34:13.500
and it did manage to roll
a bit of a ways

579
00:34:13.594 --> 00:34:15.335
down the driveway
before I was able to stop it.

580
00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:17.220
I'm sorry. I promise
I'll be more careful.

581
00:34:17.306 --> 00:34:21.841
So. that's what happened
out front.

582
00:34:21.935 --> 00:34:23.769
You sure you're not
covering for him?

583
00:34:23.854 --> 00:34:26.021
It wouldn't be the first time
he's tried taking out the car

584
00:34:26.148 --> 00:34:27.773
since his license
was suspended.

585
00:34:27.858 --> 00:34:32.069
(chuckling) I assure you.
your father was well behaved.

586
00:34:32.154 --> 00:34:35.197
Warren is a lovely.
playful man.

587
00:34:35.324 --> 00:34:39.701
I don't think that's exactly
how I'd describe my father.

588
00:34:39.828 --> 00:34:42.862
Heh. Also.
your daughter Hayley is here.

589
00:34:42.956 --> 00:34:45.791
It seems she left school early
complaining about a flu.

590
00:34:45.876 --> 00:34:47.459
So. I made her a cup of soup

591
00:34:47.544 --> 00:34:48.919
and I tucked her into bed
in the guest room.

592
00:34:49.004 --> 00:34:50.670
Oh. I'll go and check.

593
00:34:50.756 --> 00:34:53.048
Oh. no. I'm sure she's just
sleeping it off.

594
00:34:53.175 --> 00:34:54.925
What about you? Were you able
to put out that office fire?

595
00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:59.045
Oh. I don't know
about it being a fire.

596
00:34:59.139 --> 00:35:02.516
It's more like the water level
rising to fill the room.

597
00:35:04.353 --> 00:35:06.311
Well. I was just about
to start cleaning. so.

598
00:35:10.818 --> 00:35:12.943
Warren:
Is that you down there. Madison?

599
00:35:16.031 --> 00:35:18.281
Madison:
Dad. How was your day?

600
00:35:29.753 --> 00:35:32.170
- Hey. honey.
- Oh.

601
00:35:32.256 --> 00:35:34.914
Emmett. when you checked
Rebecca's references.

602
00:35:35.008 --> 00:35:37.417
nothing came up. right?
No red flags?

603
00:35:37.511 --> 00:35:39.261
I called every number
she listed.

604
00:35:39.388 --> 00:35:41.304
The ones I got through to
all had glowing reviews.

605
00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:43.515
You still worried
about this?

606
00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.059
I thought
she's been a godsend.

607
00:35:46.145 --> 00:35:48.395
She has. and you're right.

608
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.772
It just isn't sitting well
with me. I guess.

609
00:35:50.899 --> 00:35:53.316
Giving someone this much access
to our family.

610
00:35:53.402 --> 00:35:56.945
Honey. We can't control
everything.

611
00:35:57.072 --> 00:35:59.072
We certainly can't control
what's happening to your father.

612
00:35:59.158 --> 00:36:02.367
We're all gonna have to learn
to let go a little.

613
00:36:02.452 --> 00:36:04.369
All the same. it doesn't hurt
to double check.

614
00:36:05.956 --> 00:36:07.289
Is Hayley home?

615
00:36:07.416 --> 00:36:09.875
She's in bed.
She wasn't feeling well.

616
00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:12.210
Oh. I'll go check on her.

617
00:36:23.056 --> 00:36:24.464
(phone ringing internally)

618
00:36:24.558 --> 00:36:26.799
Man: Strathmere Retirement Home.
This is Steve.

619
00:36:26.894 --> 00:36:28.968
Yes. hi.
My name's Madison Lockhart.

620
00:36:29.062 --> 00:36:31.688
I'm calling about
a former staff member of yours.

621
00:36:31.773 --> 00:36:33.640
Rebecca Wilson.

622
00:36:33.734 --> 00:36:35.400
I'm looking for information
about what kind of role

623
00:36:35.485 --> 00:36:37.277
she played at your facility.

624
00:36:37.362 --> 00:36:40.113
Steve: I'm sorry. Is Ms. Wilson
not meeting your expectations?

625
00:36:40.199 --> 00:36:42.908
I think I might have spoken with
another member of your family--

626
00:36:42.993 --> 00:36:44.367
Emmett. was it?

627
00:36:44.453 --> 00:36:46.828
Uh. that's right.
I'm just following up.

628
00:36:46.955 --> 00:36:50.707
I'd like to know a little bit
more about Rebecca. if possible.

629
00:36:50.792 --> 00:36:53.501
I'm sure you understand.

630
00:36:53.629 --> 00:36:55.795
What were her reasons
for leaving. for instance?

631
00:36:55.881 --> 00:36:58.423
Were there any complaints
made against her?

632
00:36:58.508 --> 00:37:00.050
Unfortunately.
I'm not at liberty

633
00:37:00.135 --> 00:37:01.843
to give out that kind
of information.

634
00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:04.804
But I can assure you Ms. Wilson
left on glowing terms.

635
00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:07.098
We were sad to see her go.

636
00:37:07.184 --> 00:37:09.684
Madison:
Okay. Thanks for your help.

637
00:37:09.811 --> 00:37:12.437
No problem whatsoever. You
have yourself a nice evening.

638
00:37:20.781 --> 00:37:22.781
She's getting antsy.

639
00:37:22.866 --> 00:37:25.191
You're not as good
as you think you are.

640
00:37:25.285 --> 00:37:27.035
She's just having
a moment of doubt.

641
00:37:27.162 --> 00:37:30.247
She'll stop at one and feel
it's enough. Trust me.

642
00:37:30.332 --> 00:37:31.623
If another one
of those phones rings.

643
00:37:31.708 --> 00:37:33.366
then we might
have a problem.

644
00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:36.544
All this sneaking around.
All these games.

645
00:37:36.672 --> 00:37:38.296
What's the point?!

646
00:37:38.382 --> 00:37:41.341
When I could just
go shoot him in the head?

647
00:37:41.426 --> 00:37:44.094
First he needs to suffer.

648
00:37:44.179 --> 00:37:46.972
First they need to know what
it's like to lose everything.

649
00:37:48.308 --> 00:37:50.684
Don't you ever doubt me.
little brother.

650
00:37:52.646 --> 00:37:55.605
Don't you ever forget who
took care of you. who fed you.

651
00:37:55.691 --> 00:37:59.401
who protected you when
Mom and Dad weren't there.

652
00:37:59.528 --> 00:38:02.487
- Don't you ever.
- Okay.

653
00:38:02.572 --> 00:38:04.572
We do it your way.

654
00:38:06.034 --> 00:38:08.618
What did I tell you?
She stopped at one.

655
00:38:11.832 --> 00:38:12.789
So. now that you found it.

656
00:38:12.874 --> 00:38:15.575
how do we get inside it?

657
00:38:15.669 --> 00:38:18.378
We don't. Not unless you know
how to crack

658
00:38:18.463 --> 00:38:21.589
an Omniguard EL90 fireproof.
tamper-proof

659
00:38:21.717 --> 00:38:23.591
home security vault.

660
00:38:23.719 --> 00:38:25.510
If we want in.
we need the combination.

661
00:38:25.595 --> 00:38:27.587
The old man
won't just tell us.

662
00:38:27.681 --> 00:38:29.973
Not unless I find the
right way to ask him.

663
00:38:30.058 --> 00:38:33.268
Warren Lockhart
needs to have an accident.

664
00:38:45.198 --> 00:38:48.408
- Beautiful day. isn't it?
- Hm. certainly is.

665
00:38:48.493 --> 00:38:50.610
I'm sorry we didn't
get to do this sooner.

666
00:38:50.704 --> 00:38:51.995
You're already looking better.
handsome.

667
00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.330
getting out
of that stuffy old house.

668
00:38:53.415 --> 00:38:56.124
Mm. all right.
Lead the way.

669
00:38:56.251 --> 00:38:59.085
First. we hydrate.

670
00:38:59.171 --> 00:39:01.788
And you need
to take your pills.

671
00:39:01.882 --> 00:39:04.123
Didn't I already take these?

672
00:39:04.217 --> 00:39:08.094
Trust me. Warren.
your organizer doesn't lie.

673
00:39:11.641 --> 00:39:13.892
Ruth would've loved it here.

674
00:39:13.977 --> 00:39:17.020
She was such a fan
of the outdoors.

675
00:39:17.105 --> 00:39:18.471
Is that why you bought
the lake house?

676
00:39:18.565 --> 00:39:20.023
The one in the photos?

677
00:39:20.108 --> 00:39:24.486
Ruth. she used to say...

678
00:39:24.613 --> 00:39:26.696
What did Ruth use to say?

679
00:39:29.451 --> 00:39:30.825
She would've loved it here.

680
00:39:30.952 --> 00:39:34.320
She was a big fan
of the outdoors.

681
00:39:34.414 --> 00:39:35.872
Tell me more about Ruth.

682
00:39:38.752 --> 00:39:42.796
What time is it. Rebecca?
I've lost track.

683
00:39:42.881 --> 00:39:44.047
I thought
we could stop up ahead.

684
00:39:44.132 --> 00:39:45.340
I hear there's
quite a lookout.

685
00:39:45.467 --> 00:39:47.675
Are you up for that?

686
00:39:47.803 --> 00:39:50.553
Rebecca. I think
these new pills--

687
00:39:50.639 --> 00:39:52.055
they're affecting
my vertigo.

688
00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:54.933
Come on. Warren.
A big. strong buck like you?

689
00:39:55.018 --> 00:39:56.351
You can do it!

690
00:39:56.478 --> 00:39:57.852
(breathing heavily)

691
00:40:07.197 --> 00:40:09.239
Hello?

692
00:40:09.324 --> 00:40:12.191
Hello? Ruth?

693
00:40:12.285 --> 00:40:13.618
Ruth?

694
00:40:13.703 --> 00:40:14.702
- (twig cracking)
- Ah!

695
00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:16.246
(thudding)

696
00:40:19.793 --> 00:40:20.875
I spoke with Gertie in Berlin.

697
00:40:21.002 --> 00:40:22.535
They're amenable
to the loan

698
00:40:22.629 --> 00:40:25.255
but the terms aren't exactly
what we call favorable.

699
00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:27.215
It leaves us in quite the spot
for the foreseeable future.

700
00:40:27.342 --> 00:40:28.925
It leaves us vulnerable.

701
00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:31.678
The question is.
is it worth it

702
00:40:31.763 --> 00:40:34.305
or do we simply
cut the losses?

703
00:40:36.643 --> 00:40:37.934
Is something on your mind?

704
00:40:38.019 --> 00:40:40.145
We're only talking
about the survivability

705
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:42.397
of your family legacy here.

706
00:40:43.525 --> 00:40:45.108
You met her. right?

707
00:40:45.193 --> 00:40:47.235
My father's new caregiver.
Rebecca Wilson?

708
00:40:47.362 --> 00:40:51.230
Uh. briefly.
at your mother's wake.

709
00:40:51.324 --> 00:40:54.325
You've always been good
at reading people.

710
00:40:54.411 --> 00:40:55.827
You're having misgivings?

711
00:40:55.912 --> 00:40:59.205
Something just feels off.

712
00:40:59.291 --> 00:41:01.207
Do you wanna know
what I think?

713
00:41:02.377 --> 00:41:04.043
Always.

714
00:41:04.129 --> 00:41:05.745
I think
you're feeling guilty

715
00:41:05.839 --> 00:41:08.381
for not taking care
of your father yourself.

716
00:41:08.467 --> 00:41:11.259
protecting him
like a good daughter should.

717
00:41:11.386 --> 00:41:13.094
So you're projecting
that blame onto Rebecca--

718
00:41:13.221 --> 00:41:17.140
seeing fault. seeing conspiracy.

719
00:41:17.225 --> 00:41:18.850
where plainly
there is none.

720
00:41:19.895 --> 00:41:21.311
Maybe you're right.

721
00:41:21.396 --> 00:41:22.896
I think I just needed
to hear a second opinion.

722
00:41:22.981 --> 00:41:25.523
I'm your friend.
This is what I do.

723
00:41:25.609 --> 00:41:29.486
Among 10.000 other things.

724
00:41:29.571 --> 00:41:31.863
Now. do we accept
that offer from Berlin

725
00:41:31.948 --> 00:41:34.240
or do we listen to Arnold?

726
00:41:38.079 --> 00:41:41.247
I always knew that some day
I'd be sitting in this chair.

727
00:41:41.333 --> 00:41:44.209
Making decisions
with other people's money.

728
00:41:44.294 --> 00:41:45.919
Now that I'm here.

729
00:41:46.004 --> 00:41:47.545
I can't fathom the thought
of letting it go.

730
00:41:47.631 --> 00:41:49.789
(phone ringing)

731
00:41:49.883 --> 00:41:51.883
It's Rebecca.
I have to take this.

732
00:41:53.303 --> 00:41:55.595
Rebecca. hi.
Is everything all right?

733
00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.630
Rebecca: Madison.
I don't want you to panic.

734
00:41:57.724 --> 00:41:59.182
Your dad is going to be
just fine.

735
00:41:59.267 --> 00:42:01.017
My dad? What happened?

736
00:42:01.102 --> 00:42:04.729
Rebecca: He had a fall. We're
on our way to the hospital.

737
00:42:04.814 --> 00:42:07.524
- I have to go.
- Yeah. go. go!

738
00:42:16.117 --> 00:42:17.483
Dad?

739
00:42:17.577 --> 00:42:20.370
Oh my God. Are you all right?
What happened?

740
00:42:20.455 --> 00:42:22.747
We were walking
on his favorite trail

741
00:42:22.832 --> 00:42:24.541
and he must've tripped
on a root?

742
00:42:24.626 --> 00:42:27.710
I'm sorry. Madison.
It's all my fault.

743
00:42:27.796 --> 00:42:29.212
I thought I would be
doing him a favor.

744
00:42:29.297 --> 00:42:31.506
He's just been so cooped up
in that house.

745
00:42:31.633 --> 00:42:32.924
How is he now?

746
00:42:33.009 --> 00:42:34.551
Your father suffered
a minor knee injury

747
00:42:34.636 --> 00:42:36.177
and a bump on the head.

748
00:42:36.304 --> 00:42:39.514
I don't see any signs
of fractures or concussion.

749
00:42:39.641 --> 00:42:41.057
I see no reason
to keep him overnight.

750
00:42:41.142 --> 00:42:43.017
It was lucky Rebecca was
with him when it happened.

751
00:42:43.144 --> 00:42:44.677
She had to carry him
back to the car herself

752
00:42:44.771 --> 00:42:46.312
to get him here so quickly.

753
00:42:46.398 --> 00:42:49.015
It's nothing.
He's exaggerating.

754
00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:51.776
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Enough with all the fuss.

755
00:42:51.861 --> 00:42:53.695
You're hurt. Dad.

756
00:42:53.822 --> 00:42:55.697
Doctor: That knee
will need time to heal.

757
00:42:55.824 --> 00:42:57.699
Four to six weeks
with no pressure on it.

758
00:42:57.826 --> 00:43:00.159
You'll need to use a cane
for mobility as well.

759
00:43:00.245 --> 00:43:01.744
I wanna see you
for a follow-up next week.

760
00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:04.247
Thank you. Dr. Lund.

761
00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:10.587
Uh. what do I do now?

762
00:43:10.672 --> 00:43:13.047
He's gonna need 24-hour care
for the next month.

763
00:43:13.174 --> 00:43:14.591
Can you recommend
any caregiving agencies?

764
00:43:14.676 --> 00:43:16.384
I certainly can.

765
00:43:16.511 --> 00:43:18.544
but there's an extremely long
waiting list for these services.

766
00:43:18.638 --> 00:43:20.221
It could take weeks--

767
00:43:20.348 --> 00:43:24.392
I don't want no rent-a-nurse!
I've got Rebecca.

768
00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:29.564
(sighing) Dad. you need
someone there at night.

769
00:43:29.691 --> 00:43:31.107
What if you fall again?

770
00:43:31.192 --> 00:43:33.559
Just getting up the stairs
is gonna be a struggle.

771
00:43:33.653 --> 00:43:35.903
You need someone there
with you full-time.

772
00:43:36.031 --> 00:43:38.731
That would be
no problem whatsoever.

773
00:43:38.825 --> 00:43:40.066
Are you sure. Rebecca?

774
00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:42.285
That's an awfully big
commitment.

775
00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:45.237
"In for a penny.
in for a pound."

776
00:43:45.332 --> 00:43:47.081

777
00:43:47.208 --> 00:43:50.242
Dad? What do you think?

778
00:43:50.337 --> 00:43:52.503
Well. that depends.

00:52:28.229 --> 00:52:30.062
I've been informed
you're acting as intermediary

874
00:52:30.148 --> 00:52:32.022
between Warren Lockhart
and his family?

875
00:52:32.108 --> 00:52:33.649
That's correct.

876
00:52:33.734 --> 00:52:36.443
What can I do for you. Doctor?
I'm awfully busy.

877
00:52:36.571 --> 00:52:38.070
I'm calling to let you know

878
00:52:38.156 --> 00:52:40.656
the results of Warren's
blood test came back. and--

879
00:52:40.741 --> 00:52:43.159
I'm concerned about the levels
of temazepam we've detected.

880
00:52:43.244 --> 00:52:46.445
I'd prescribed a small dose
to help him sleep.

881
00:52:46.539 --> 00:52:47.872
but if these levels
are accurate

882
00:52:47.957 --> 00:52:49.665
I'd be surprised
if he can make it out of bed

883
00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:51.116
or function at all.

884
00:52:51.210 --> 00:52:53.794
We need to schedule
an immediate follow-up.

885
00:52:53.921 --> 00:52:55.421
Thank you. Doctor.

886
00:52:55.506 --> 00:52:58.757
This is terribly concerning.
I'll get right on that.

887
00:53:07.935 --> 00:53:10.135
Hi. Dad.

888
00:53:10.229 --> 00:53:11.353
How are you?

889
00:53:11.439 --> 00:53:13.314
Just you visiting.
no Hayley?

890
00:53:13.441 --> 00:53:16.025
It's just me. Dad.
Hayley's busy at school.

891
00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:17.568
but she wants
to come see you later.

892
00:53:17.653 --> 00:53:20.029
Here's the coffee for you.
Warren.

893
00:53:20.114 --> 00:53:21.322
Just how you like it.

894
00:53:21.449 --> 00:53:23.148
And what can I get you
for breakfast?

895
00:53:23.242 --> 00:53:26.285
Actually. Rebecca. if you don't
mind giving us a minute first?

896
00:53:28.331 --> 00:53:29.488
Let me know if you need
anything.

897
00:53:29.582 --> 00:53:31.081
Okay.

898
00:53:32.210 --> 00:53:33.792
Come.

899
00:53:39.467 --> 00:53:41.300
How's everything going
with you two. Dad?

900
00:53:41.385 --> 00:53:42.551
With Rebecca?

901
00:53:42.637 --> 00:53:44.503
(chuckling)

902
00:53:44.597 --> 00:53:47.005
You wouldn't have to ask
if you were around more.

903
00:53:47.099 --> 00:53:48.840
Dad. that's not fair.

904
00:53:48.935 --> 00:53:50.851
I was here yesterday.

905
00:53:50.978 --> 00:53:52.728
It seems like
you're always sleeping.

906
00:53:52.813 --> 00:53:54.230
I'm trying.

907
00:53:54.315 --> 00:53:57.233
We've been trying
to spare you the details.

908
00:53:57.318 --> 00:54:00.402
but it's been very chaotic
at the firm.

909
00:54:00.488 --> 00:54:03.030
In fact. there is something
we need to talk about.

910
00:54:03.157 --> 00:54:04.573
I don't wanna talk
about the firm.

911
00:54:04.659 --> 00:54:07.159
I don't wanna talk
about any of that right now.

912
00:54:07.245 --> 00:54:08.535
Where's Rebecca?

913
00:54:08.663 --> 00:54:10.079
We were supposed
to go for ice cream.

914
00:54:10.164 --> 00:54:13.457
Ice cream?
Dad. it's 8:30 in the morn--

915
00:54:15.336 --> 00:54:18.420
Dad. are you sure
you're okay?

916
00:54:18.506 --> 00:54:20.589
Maybe we need to make another
appointment with Dr. Lund.

917
00:54:20.675 --> 00:54:24.543
No. No more hospitals.

918
00:54:24.637 --> 00:54:27.888
Just let Rebecca work her magic.
I'll be fine.

919
00:54:37.358 --> 00:54:39.725
I left Dr. Lund's number
on the table.

920
00:54:39.819 --> 00:54:41.610
I'm sorry I have to rush
back to work.

921
00:54:41.696 --> 00:54:43.737
but if anything changes.
please call me.

922
00:54:43.864 --> 00:54:45.489
Of course.

923
00:54:45.574 --> 00:54:47.241
- Hey.
- Hayley!

924
00:54:47.368 --> 00:54:49.401
Grandpa's gonna be so happy
to see you.

925
00:54:49.495 --> 00:54:51.453
Yeah. I picked up some
of his favorite gummies.

926
00:54:51.539 --> 00:54:53.122
Dad told me
about his leg.

927
00:54:53.207 --> 00:54:54.957
That's so thoughtful of you.
sweetheart.

928
00:54:55.042 --> 00:54:56.500
He's gonna love it.

929
00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:02.080
You've raised
such a lovely daughter.

930
00:55:02.174 --> 00:55:04.633
I have. haven't I?

931
00:55:04.719 --> 00:55:06.918
At least
I got that part right.

932
00:55:07.013 --> 00:55:08.420
I should go.

933
00:55:08.514 --> 00:55:10.472
- Thanks again. Rebecca.
- Pleasure's all mine.

934
00:55:14.228 --> 00:55:15.769
(car engine starting)

935
00:55:24.905 --> 00:55:26.322
How was your visit?

936
00:55:28.534 --> 00:55:30.409
Rebecca. Hey. you scared me.

937
00:55:31.996 --> 00:55:34.580
Don't be scared. honey!
Come sit. let's have a chat.

938
00:55:36.584 --> 00:55:37.750
About what?

939
00:55:37.835 --> 00:55:40.044
About you. silly!

940
00:55:40.129 --> 00:55:41.620
How's school?

941
00:55:41.714 --> 00:55:43.121
Are you seeing anyone special?

942
00:55:43.215 --> 00:55:44.790
I see they fixed that dent.

943
00:55:44.884 --> 00:55:47.384
It's almost as if
that little accident of yours

944
00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:49.511
never happened. isn't it?

945
00:55:49.597 --> 00:55:50.763
You know.
it's a really good thing

946
00:55:50.848 --> 00:55:52.306
that you only hit
that flower pot.

947
00:55:52.433 --> 00:55:55.351
Imagine if that had been
a person or your grandpa.

948
00:55:55.436 --> 00:55:58.136
You do remember. right?

949
00:55:58.230 --> 00:56:01.982
'Cause if you need a reminder.
I have photos.

950
00:56:02.109 --> 00:56:04.476
Wanna see?

951
00:56:04.570 --> 00:56:06.070
What do you want. Rebecca?

952
00:56:06.155 --> 00:56:07.646
(sighing)

953
00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:11.149
The truth is. Hayley. I--
I really need your help.

954
00:56:11.243 --> 00:56:12.868
I'm at my wit's end
and I don't know what to do.

955
00:56:12.953 --> 00:56:14.119
Why? What's going on?

956
00:56:14.205 --> 00:56:16.246
It's this watch.

957
00:56:16.332 --> 00:56:17.823
Your grandfather's watch.

958
00:56:17.917 --> 00:56:20.542
It's all he talks about.
all he thinks about.

959
00:56:20.628 --> 00:56:22.828
I can't get him to eat.
I can't get him to sleep.

960
00:56:22.922 --> 00:56:24.755
He can't find his watch?
That doesn't sound so bad.

961
00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:25.997
He's got like ten of them.

962
00:56:26.092 --> 00:56:28.500
Oh no. no.
You don't understand.

963
00:56:28.594 --> 00:56:29.927
For someone
with Warren's condition.

964
00:56:30.012 --> 00:56:33.180
the mind obsesses
over this thing.

965
00:56:33.307 --> 00:56:36.174
He's convinced.
absolutely convinced

966
00:56:36.268 --> 00:56:37.843
that he locked it
in his safe.

967
00:56:37.937 --> 00:56:41.063
The one in his room where
Grandma kept her old jewels?

968
00:56:41.148 --> 00:56:42.856
Hmm.

969
00:56:42.983 --> 00:56:45.109
If there was someone
who knew a way to open it.

970
00:56:45.194 --> 00:56:46.777
it would make
a huge difference to Warren.

971
00:56:46.862 --> 00:56:49.613
to both of us.

972
00:56:49.698 --> 00:56:51.523
I'm not helping you get
into Grandpa's safe.

973
00:56:51.617 --> 00:56:52.699
Rebecca. that's crazy.

974
00:56:52.827 --> 00:56:55.244
Why don't you just ask my mom?

975
00:56:55.329 --> 00:56:57.028
Oh. trust me. I would.

976
00:56:57.123 --> 00:56:59.498
but Warren begged me not to.

977
00:56:59.583 --> 00:57:01.417
He's embarrassed.

978
00:57:01.502 --> 00:57:04.044
Your mom can have such
high expectations. you know?

979
00:57:04.171 --> 00:57:06.880
He feels like she's judging him.
belittling him.

980
00:57:08.843 --> 00:57:10.884
Yeah. I guess
she can be like that.

981
00:57:12.555 --> 00:57:13.720
Look.

982
00:57:13.848 --> 00:57:17.141
I don't know the combination.

983
00:57:17.226 --> 00:57:20.185
But I know that Grandpa
used to keep a notepad around.

984
00:57:20.271 --> 00:57:21.478
He used it
to write down stuff

985
00:57:21.564 --> 00:57:23.555
he was having trouble
remembering.

986
00:57:23.649 --> 00:57:26.733
If it's not here. it's probably
still at his office.

987
00:57:26.861 --> 00:57:28.735
You should ask Nia.

988
00:57:29.697 --> 00:57:31.363
His office.

989
00:57:31.449 --> 00:57:32.614
Thanks so much. Hayley.

990
00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:35.117
You've been
such a great help.

991
00:57:35.202 --> 00:57:37.953
I'll do that.
I'll ask Nia.

992
00:57:38.038 --> 00:57:39.496
Are we even now?

993
00:57:39.582 --> 00:57:42.541
Of course. honey!
It'll be our little secret.

994
00:57:42.626 --> 00:57:44.126
Okay.

995
00:57:52.845 --> 00:57:55.345
I got the strangest feeling
in the house today.

996
00:57:55.431 --> 00:57:58.924
And then seeing my mom's
earrings just sitting there?

997
00:57:59.018 --> 00:58:00.642
Your dad hasn't been
sleeping well.

998
00:58:00.728 --> 00:58:02.853
Maybe he moved them when
he was up wandering around

999
00:58:02.938 --> 00:58:04.763
in the middle of the night.

1000
00:58:04.857 --> 00:58:07.357
You said he's been moving
all sorts of stuff.

1001
00:58:07.443 --> 00:58:08.934
He's an old man with
memory problems. Emmett.

1002
00:58:09.028 --> 00:58:10.152
not a poltergeist.

1003
00:58:10.237 --> 00:58:11.987
I know this might
sound crazy.

1004
00:58:12.072 --> 00:58:15.324
but I could've sworn she was
wearing my mother's perfume.

1005
00:58:17.703 --> 00:58:19.328
You're right.
That does sound crazy.

1006
00:58:19.413 --> 00:58:22.280
Honey. why?

1007
00:58:22.374 --> 00:58:24.449
I'm gonna ask Arnold to run
a background check.

1008
00:58:24.543 --> 00:58:26.284
if he still has
those old police contacts.

1009
00:58:26.378 --> 00:58:27.544
Don't you think--
(exhaling)

1010
00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:30.172
--that's a bit
of an overreaction?

1011
00:58:30.257 --> 00:58:32.841
Honey. you've got that call
to Berlin tomorrow morning.

1012
00:58:32.927 --> 00:58:34.426
You have
a big decision to make.

1013
00:58:34.512 --> 00:58:38.096
You need to let this go
for tonight. get some rest.

1014
00:58:39.266 --> 00:58:40.516
Come here.

1015
00:58:46.482 --> 00:58:48.306
Can we forget about this
for just one night?

1016
00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:49.816
Yeah.

1017
00:59:05.626 --> 00:59:08.994
Let's hope no one
changed Warren's codes.

1018
00:59:09.088 --> 00:59:10.546
We'll see if Hayley was right.

1019
00:59:23.310 --> 00:59:24.476
All right.

1020
00:59:24.562 --> 00:59:26.144
Check every drawer
and every shelf.

1021
00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:28.063
Look for any notepads.
any post-it notes.

1022
00:59:28.148 --> 00:59:29.398
anything with a string
of numbers on it.

1023
00:59:29.483 --> 00:59:31.850
Any numbers at all.

1024
00:59:31.944 --> 00:59:33.193
Jesse:
Numbers?

1025
00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:35.028
We're standing
in an investment firm!

1026
00:59:35.155 --> 00:59:36.905
Just keep looking.

1027
00:59:36.991 --> 00:59:38.532
Go check those other offices.

1028
00:59:46.667 --> 00:59:47.916
This is a Crestview.

1029
00:59:48.002 --> 00:59:50.210
This costs more
than my car.

1030
00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:55.424
Can I help you?

1031
00:59:55.509 --> 00:59:56.875
Rebecca.
what are you doing here?

1032
00:59:56.969 --> 00:59:59.720
You have no business
being here.

1033
00:59:59.847 --> 01:00:01.305
What the hell's going on?

1034
01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:02.681
I'm just here for Warren.

1035
01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:04.433
He lost that watch again.

1036
01:00:04.518 --> 01:00:05.767
Can you believe it?

1037
01:00:05.853 --> 01:00:08.020
He's convinced
that he left it here.

1038
01:00:08.105 --> 01:00:11.064
He's in one of those moods.
you know. inconsolable.

1039
01:00:11.191 --> 01:00:14.484
I can't get him to eat.
I can't get him to sleep--

1040
01:00:14.570 --> 01:00:16.528
not without that watch.

1041
01:00:16.614 --> 01:00:19.230
I didn't know what else to do
so I just came here to get it.

1042
01:00:19.325 --> 01:00:21.658
It's all been
really overwhelming.

1043
01:00:21.744 --> 01:00:23.619
I'm listening. Rebecca.

1044
01:00:23.704 --> 01:00:25.329
I'm just gonna
make a quick call.

1045
01:00:25.414 --> 01:00:26.955
Not another step. Rebecca.

1046
01:00:28.542 --> 01:00:30.742
We'll let the police
work this out.

1047
01:00:30.836 --> 01:00:32.711
(screaming)

1048
01:00:40.554 --> 01:00:41.970
Madison.

1049
01:00:42.056 --> 01:00:44.589
Are you all right?
Your call sounded urgent.

1050
01:00:44.683 --> 01:00:47.059
Nia mentioned that
you were leaning

1051
01:00:47.144 --> 01:00:49.144
towards accepting
the Berlin offer.

1052
01:00:49.229 --> 01:00:50.762
You know my thoughts
on that.

1053
01:00:50.856 --> 01:00:52.814
I'm not here to talk
about the firm. Arnold.

1054
01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:56.109
I told them I'll have
my decision by end of day.

1055
01:00:56.236 --> 01:00:57.486
I'm here to talk
about Rebecca Wilson.

1056
01:00:57.571 --> 01:01:00.271
What about her?

1057
01:01:00.366 --> 01:01:03.367
You still have
those old contacts?

1058
01:01:03.452 --> 01:01:04.776
Some. What do you need?

1059
01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:08.455
I want you
to look into her for me.

1060
01:01:08.582 --> 01:01:11.375
Maybe I'm just being paranoid.
but I need to know for sure.

1061
01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:14.044
and please be discreet.

1062
01:01:14.129 --> 01:01:16.755
I'll do anything I can.
Madison.

1063
01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:19.624
No matter what happens. you know
I always have your back. right?

1064
01:01:19.718 --> 01:01:21.051
(phone notification dinging)

1065
01:01:22.554 --> 01:01:25.138
Something's happened
at the office.

1066
01:01:32.606 --> 01:01:33.897
What happened here?

1067
01:01:33.982 --> 01:01:36.775
Who is that? Nia?

1068
01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:39.569
Nia? Nia. no!

1069
01:01:39.655 --> 01:01:41.613
No! (crying)
No. no. no!

1070
01:01:50.124 --> 01:01:51.498
Maddy. you're okay.

1071
01:01:54.044 --> 01:01:55.493
I'm not okay.

1072
01:01:55.587 --> 01:01:57.254
Nia. she--

1073
01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:00.424
What happened?

1074
01:02:00.509 --> 01:02:02.500
They think it was a robbery.

1075
01:02:02.594 --> 01:02:05.846
There's nothing on camera.
They stole the security tapes.

1076
01:02:05.973 --> 01:02:07.264
But who? Why?

1077
01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:09.182
What were they after. money?

1078
01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:11.676
Client files?

1079
01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:13.562
They ransacked the office.

1080
01:02:13.647 --> 01:02:15.939
They're not clear
what the goal was. but--

1081
01:02:16.024 --> 01:02:17.357
Nia must have
surprised them.

1082
01:02:17.484 --> 01:02:20.185
(exhaling)

1083
01:02:20.279 --> 01:02:21.445
Why would anyone do this.
Emmett?

1084
01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:23.572
Why would someone
wanna hurt Nia?

1085
01:02:26.994 --> 01:02:29.286
(beeping)

1086
01:02:29.371 --> 01:02:30.996
It's not working.

1087
01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:32.539
I've tried every number
we found.

1088
01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:34.666
Try again.

1089
01:02:34.752 --> 01:02:36.543
Rebecca:
We're running out of time.

1090
01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:38.503
I should pound it
out of him.

1091
01:02:41.842 --> 01:02:43.842
We can't interrogate it
out of him.

1092
01:02:43.927 --> 01:02:46.803
We need to coax it out.

1093
01:02:46.889 --> 01:02:48.138
We need to trigger
that memory.

1094
01:02:48.223 --> 01:02:49.723
How?

1095
01:02:49.850 --> 01:02:52.267
By giving him back
what he wants most.

1096
01:02:52.352 --> 01:02:54.728
What no one else can.

1097
01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:18.710
(soft piano music playing)

1098
01:03:26.094 --> 01:03:29.012
(muffled music drifting up
from downstairs)

1099
01:03:53.038 --> 01:03:59.876
♪

1100
01:04:02.631 --> 01:04:04.714
Hello?

1101
01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.591
Is anybody here?

1102
01:04:06.677 --> 01:04:09.052
I'm here. Warren.

1103
01:04:13.308 --> 01:04:16.142
Ruth.

1104
01:04:16.270 --> 01:04:17.686
I'll always be here.

1105
01:04:17.771 --> 01:04:19.229
Oh. don't worry.
I've got you.

1106
01:04:24.278 --> 01:04:25.819
Hmm.

1107
01:04:27.865 --> 01:04:29.647
You remember this song?

1108
01:04:29.741 --> 01:04:32.534
It was playing
the first night we met.

1109
01:04:32.619 --> 01:04:34.452
Oh. Warren.
how could I forget?

1110
01:04:35.956 --> 01:04:38.373
- I missed you.
- I've missed you too.

1111
01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:41.334
And I can't wait to catch up.

1112
01:04:41.461 --> 01:04:45.964
But I just need you
to tell me one thing. sweetie.

1113
01:04:46.049 --> 01:04:47.674
What's the combination?

1114
01:04:47.801 --> 01:04:50.051
Combination?

1115
01:04:50.137 --> 01:04:51.511
(chuckling)
Oh. you silly man!

1116
01:04:51.638 --> 01:04:53.471
To the safe.

1117
01:04:53.557 --> 01:04:55.807
where we keep all
of our favorite things.

1118
01:04:55.893 --> 01:04:57.726
I've left a gift
for you inside.

1119
01:04:57.811 --> 01:05:00.812
A present for my beau.

1120
01:05:00.898 --> 01:05:03.607
We created them together.

1121
01:05:03.692 --> 01:05:08.186
88-04-11.

1122
01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:11.239
The day Madison lost
her first tooth.

1123
01:05:12.951 --> 01:05:14.409
Thank you for that.

1124
01:05:14.494 --> 01:05:16.694
You've given me so much.

1125
01:05:16.788 --> 01:05:18.863
Wait here. honey.
I'll be right back.

1126
01:05:18.957 --> 01:05:20.248
Okay.

1127
01:05:25.839 --> 01:05:27.797

1128
01:05:27.883 --> 01:05:29.674

01:05:37.684 --> 01:05:39.309
Oh.

01:05:50.656 --> 01:05:51.947
(sighing)

1131
01:05:54.326 --> 01:05:56.451
It's all here. Jesse.

1132
01:05:56.536 --> 01:05:57.994
Everything we hoped for.

1133
01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:00.830
Dad was right.

1134
01:06:00.916 --> 01:06:03.074
Now let's get the hell
out of here while we still can.

1135
01:06:03.168 --> 01:06:04.960
(doorbell ringing)

1136
01:06:09.341 --> 01:06:10.757
Wait here.

1137
01:06:21.436 --> 01:06:22.602
Rebecca:
Arnold!

1138
01:06:22.729 --> 01:06:25.605
Wasn't it?

1139
01:06:25.732 --> 01:06:28.108
I think we met
at Ruth Lockhart's wake.

1140
01:06:28.235 --> 01:06:29.434
Warren's bookkeeper.

1141
01:06:29.528 --> 01:06:31.903
Hmm. Best Man and CFO.

1142
01:06:31.989 --> 01:06:33.196
I'm here to see Warren.

1143
01:06:33.281 --> 01:06:35.615
He hasn't been
returning my calls.

1144
01:06:35.742 --> 01:06:39.035
You know. it's--
it's uncanny.

1145
01:06:39.121 --> 01:06:41.621
In that dress.
you're a spitting image of Ruth.

1146
01:06:41.748 --> 01:06:43.248
Where'd you get it?

1147
01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:44.457
Oh. I don't know.

1148
01:06:44.584 --> 01:06:46.209
Some vintage bin
down in Wallaceburg.

1149
01:06:46.294 --> 01:06:49.713
If there's a message
I'm happy to relay it.

1150
01:06:49.798 --> 01:06:51.756
Oh? Is Warren indisposed?

1151
01:06:51.842 --> 01:06:56.136
He's suffering a degenerative
brain disease. Arnold.

1152
01:06:56.263 --> 01:06:57.929
Yes. I'd say he's indisposed.

1153
01:07:00.308 --> 01:07:04.019
Um. Dr. Lund recently switched
Warren's medication.

1154
01:07:04.104 --> 01:07:05.636
He hasn't been
sleeping well.

1155
01:07:05.731 --> 01:07:09.566
Neither of us has been
sleeping much. I'll admit.

1156
01:07:09.651 --> 01:07:12.235
There have been
a few episodes.

1157
01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:14.279
Uh-huh.

1158
01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:17.365
Rebecca. I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to insist on seeing Warren.

1159
01:07:17.451 --> 01:07:18.908
I have news.

1160
01:07:30.088 --> 01:07:31.996
Arnold. Is that you?

1161
01:07:32.090 --> 01:07:34.007
Warren?

1162
01:07:34.134 --> 01:07:36.634
- It's been years!
- Years?

1163
01:07:38.597 --> 01:07:41.389
Years. Warren. I--

1164
01:07:41.475 --> 01:07:42.849
We should sit down.

1165
01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.906
I need to speak
to my friend. alone.

1166
01:08:07.334 --> 01:08:11.294
There was a break-in. Warren.
at Lockhart Investments.

1167
01:08:11.379 --> 01:08:13.088
Nia was there at the time.
She--

1168
01:08:13.173 --> 01:08:16.216
I am so sorry. Warren.

1169
01:08:17.344 --> 01:08:18.510
Nia's dead.

1170
01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:21.429
Nia? No.

1171
01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:24.849
Where's Madison?

1172
01:08:24.935 --> 01:08:26.551
She couldn't come herself?

1173
01:08:26.645 --> 01:08:27.894
Madison is still
at the firm.

1174
01:08:28.021 --> 01:08:29.521
She's speaking to police.

1175
01:08:29.606 --> 01:08:33.608
I thought it would be better
if you heard it from me.

1176
01:08:33.693 --> 01:08:37.112
(whispering) Warren.
we can speak in confidence.

1177
01:08:38.698 --> 01:08:41.908
Are you okay? Is she
mistreating you in some way?

1178
01:08:42.035 --> 01:08:44.452
What is this really all about.
Arnold?

1179
01:08:44.538 --> 01:08:45.736
Is this about my estate?

1180
01:08:45.831 --> 01:08:48.206
What? No.

1181
01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:50.083
Madison told me
about your little plan.

1182
01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:53.586
Out there looking
for offers to buy me out.

1183
01:08:53.713 --> 01:08:55.088
Warren. I assure you.

1184
01:08:55.215 --> 01:08:57.415
I would never do anything
that was contrary

1185
01:08:57.509 --> 01:09:00.343
to the best interests
of you or your family.

1186
01:09:00.428 --> 01:09:01.594
Warren!

1187
01:09:01.721 --> 01:09:03.588
Your family is my family.

1188
01:09:03.682 --> 01:09:07.433
I trusted you. Arnold.
You were like a brother to me.

1189
01:09:07.561 --> 01:09:08.935
This is how you repay me?

1190
01:09:09.062 --> 01:09:11.271
How could you?

1191
01:09:11.398 --> 01:09:14.432
You were my best friend!

1192
01:09:14.526 --> 01:09:16.434
(sighing)

1193
01:09:16.528 --> 01:09:17.902
Get out.

1194
01:09:19.239 --> 01:09:21.281
Get out!

1195
01:09:21.408 --> 01:09:23.116
I think that's enough.

1196
01:09:23.243 --> 01:09:24.159
Warren. Warren. I--

1197
01:09:24.244 --> 01:09:26.244
Please. You need to go.

1198
01:09:28.915 --> 01:09:31.782
I'm so sorry. Warren.

1199
01:09:31.877 --> 01:09:34.836
I'm so sorry
I've let this happen.

1200
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:40.091
I'll be back soon.

1201
01:09:42.053 --> 01:09:43.344

1204
01:09:57.944 --> 01:10:00.811
Madison. call me back
right away.

1205
01:10:00.906 --> 01:10:02.030
I've just been
to see your father.

1206
01:10:02.115 --> 01:10:04.073
Something is very wrong.

Joshua.

1208
01:10:13.126 --> 01:10:15.335
Were you able to run that check
on Rebeca Wilson?

1209
01:10:17.797 --> 01:10:19.881
But that's not possible.

1210
01:10:21.051 --> 01:10:23.092
Are you sure?

1211
01:10:23.178 --> 01:10:25.595
You're absolutely sure?

1212
01:10:27.974 --> 01:10:29.557
All right.
Thank you. Joshua.

1213

Please keep this confidential.

1214
01:10:43.323 --> 01:10:45.856
I just can't believe it.

She was my best friend.
Emmett.

1216
01:10:49.204 --> 01:10:51.913

is unraveling so fast.

1217

I gotta go see Dad.

1218

tell him the news.
He adored Nia.

1219
01:10:56.628 --> 01:10:58.202
I asked Arnold to.

1220
01:10:58.296 --> 01:10:59.420
You have enough on your plate.

1221
01:10:59.506 --> 01:11:01.130
You did?

1222
01:11:03.843 --> 01:11:05.260
Hayley:
I got your call. Mom.

1223
01:11:08.014 --> 01:11:09.222
Nia?

1224
01:11:09.349 --> 01:11:10.932
Now Nia?
What the hell is happening?

1225
01:11:11.017 --> 01:11:13.142
Honey. come here.

1226
01:11:19.025 --> 01:11:20.558
(sighing)
We're gonna get through this.

1227
01:11:20.652 --> 01:11:22.860
Hayley. as a family.

1228
01:11:22.946 --> 01:11:24.729
Just gotta be strong
and help each other.

1229
01:11:24.823 --> 01:11:28.199
Mom...

1230
01:11:28.285 --> 01:11:29.909
Dad. there's something
I need to tell you.

1231
01:11:30.036 --> 01:11:32.620
About Rebecca.

1232
01:11:40.213 --> 01:11:41.746
Hello? Dad?

1233
01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.080
Anybody?

1234
01:11:43.174 --> 01:11:44.966
Warren?

1235
01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:55.593
Arnold:
Madison?

1236
01:11:55.687 --> 01:11:57.353
(gasping)

1237
01:11:57.439 --> 01:12:00.765
Madison? Madison?

1238
01:12:00.859 --> 01:12:01.983
Arnold?

1239
01:12:02.068 --> 01:12:05.320
Oh my God.
Did Rebecca do this?

1240
01:12:05.405 --> 01:12:06.571
Where is she?
Where is my dad?

1241
01:12:06.656 --> 01:12:11.284
Oh. my--
Your fa-- your father--

1242
01:12:11.411 --> 01:12:13.661
He kept secrets.

1243
01:12:13.747 --> 01:12:16.956
Terrible secrets from you
and from Ruth.

1244
01:12:17.083 --> 01:12:18.207
Rebecca. her--

1245
01:12:18.293 --> 01:12:21.836
Her real name is--

1246
01:12:21.921 --> 01:12:25.340
Jane Butler.

1247
01:12:25.425 --> 01:12:28.009
Her father was a client

1248
01:12:28.094 --> 01:12:31.012
of Warren Lockhart
Investments.

1249
01:12:31.097 --> 01:12:35.683
This is about revenge.

1250
01:12:35.769 --> 01:12:38.686
She has evidence. Madison.

1251
01:12:38.772 --> 01:12:41.189
Enough to take everything.

1252
01:12:42.609 --> 01:12:45.693
They've gone--
gone to the lake house.

1253
01:12:45.779 --> 01:12:48.112
Don't-- don't let her--

1254
01:12:48.198 --> 01:12:50.782
Don't let her take
everything we've built.

1255
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:53.201
Don't-- don't let her.

1256
01:12:53.286 --> 01:12:57.205
Arnold? Arnold?

1257
01:12:57.290 --> 01:12:59.374
Emmett. can you stay with him
until the ambulance gets here?

1258
01:12:59.459 --> 01:13:02.827
What? No! I'm going with you.
We'll wait for the police.

1259
01:13:02.921 --> 01:13:04.161
It's my dad.

1260
01:13:04.255 --> 01:13:06.547
my fault this is happening.

1261
01:13:06.633 --> 01:13:08.800
I let Rebecca in.
I have to fix this.

1262
01:13:39.165 --> 01:13:41.207
Where are we?
- We're here. Warren.

1263
01:13:41.334 --> 01:13:43.084
at your favorite place.

1264
01:13:43.169 --> 01:13:44.368
We're at the lake house.

1265
01:13:44.462 --> 01:13:46.295
Was I asleep
the entire drive?

1266
01:13:46.381 --> 01:13:48.673
(chuckling)
You slept like a baby.

1267
01:13:48.758 --> 01:13:50.299
Come on. sleepy head.
Let's go.

1268
01:14:06.317 --> 01:14:07.558
My God.

1269
01:14:07.652 --> 01:14:10.445
I forgot how grand
this place was.

1270
01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:12.196
We've been here before?

1271
01:14:12.282 --> 01:14:14.565
It's all so hazy.

1272
01:14:14.659 --> 01:14:16.993
It was a long drive. Warren.

1273
01:14:17.078 --> 01:14:19.287
Let's get you a drink
and get you comfortable.

1274
01:14:19.372 --> 01:14:22.623
Dr. Lund said I shouldn't
mix alcohol with my pills.

1275
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:25.293
But tonight
is a special night.

1276
01:14:25.378 --> 01:14:28.337
All those rules
are so far. far away.

1277
01:14:48.443 --> 01:14:51.936
I remember being here. once.

1278
01:14:52.030 --> 01:14:54.614
At this lake house.

1279
01:14:54.741 --> 01:14:57.274
Feels like forever ago.

1280
01:14:57.368 --> 01:15:00.411
I was with my dad.

1281
01:15:00.497 --> 01:15:02.279
And you were entertaining
important clients

1282
01:15:02.373 --> 01:15:04.957
to celebrate a banner year.

1283
01:15:05.084 --> 01:15:07.710
I remember diving
off that dock.

1284
01:15:07.795 --> 01:15:09.921
swimming in that water.

1285
01:15:11.341 --> 01:15:14.625
It's the last happy
childhood memory I have.

1286
01:15:14.719 --> 01:15:16.260
That summer.

1287
01:15:18.056 --> 01:15:20.640
I suppose it makes sense
this is where it ends.

1288
01:15:20.767 --> 01:15:23.726
I'm sorry.

1289
01:15:23.811 --> 01:15:25.811
I don't remember.

1290
01:15:27.899 --> 01:15:30.608
Of course
you don't remember.

that must be.

1292

off your shoulders.

1293
01:15:38.117 --> 01:15:40.484
I have to make a call.

Just tell me the truth.
What did my father do to you?

1384

Your father...
got very greedy.

Maddy.

1386
01:20:52.139 --> 01:20:53.514

on the side

1387

using his clients' money.

1388
01:20:56.352 --> 01:20:59.603
He lost big. and he let
his clients take the fall.

1389
01:21:01.315 --> 01:21:04.859
One of those clients
was Mike Butler. my father.

1390
01:21:06.445 --> 01:21:08.979
He took losing everything
pretty hard.

1391
01:21:09.073 --> 01:21:11.448
Took it out on me and Jesse
for a while.

1392
01:21:11.534 --> 01:21:13.284

not long after that.

01:21:16.289 --> 01:21:17.830
Of course it's true!

01:21:17.957 --> 01:21:19.623
It's all right here
in these ledger books.

1396
01:21:19.709 --> 01:21:22.877
I know my father made
some bad investment decisions.

1397

doing anything criminal.

You're a gullible fool.

1399
01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:30.092
What will any of this fix.
Rebecca?

1400
01:21:30.177 --> 01:21:31.927
Is it money you want?

1401
01:21:32.013 --> 01:21:34.221
Let's see if we can come
to an arrangement.

1402
01:21:34.307 --> 01:21:37.850
If it's true that my father
did what you said.

1403
01:21:37.977 --> 01:21:39.476
give me a chance
to make it up to you.

1404
01:21:39.562 --> 01:21:42.271
I lost my family.

1405
01:21:42.356 --> 01:21:45.015
My entire childhood.

1406
01:21:45.109 --> 01:21:47.017
How could you make that
up to me?

1407
01:21:47.111 --> 01:21:48.235
I lost everything
because of him.

1408
01:21:48.321 --> 01:21:50.237
and he can't even remember!

1409
01:21:50.323 --> 01:21:54.283
There's no making this up to me.
Madison.

1410
01:21:54.368 --> 01:21:56.118
No money can fix this.

1411
01:21:57.705 --> 01:21:59.455
Not anymore.

1412
01:22:01.959 --> 01:22:04.293
(phone ringing)

1413
01:22:04.378 --> 01:22:05.753
Put them on.

1414
01:22:07.965 --> 01:22:10.007
Jesse:
Smile.

1415
01:22:13.679 --> 01:22:15.721
(shallow breathing)

1416
01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:19.266
Now will you sign?

1417
01:22:19.352 --> 01:22:21.435
Or should I tell my brother
to shoot Hayley in the leg?

1418
01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:22.895
No!

1419
01:22:27.693 --> 01:22:30.069
She needs to be reminded
the stakes. Do it.

1420
01:22:30.196 --> 01:22:32.062
Wait. Stop. I'll sign.

1421
01:22:32.156 --> 01:22:35.658
Just-- let me see them again.
Let me see they're okay.

1422
01:22:35.743 --> 01:22:37.868
Hayley. honey.
are you all right?

1423
01:22:37.954 --> 01:22:39.203
I'm fine. Mom.

1424
01:22:39.288 --> 01:22:40.454
What's happening?
What do they want?

1425
01:22:40.539 --> 01:22:42.915
Everything's gonna be fine.
sweetie.

1426
01:22:43.042 --> 01:22:46.043
I just wanna tell you. you and
Emmett how much I love you.

1427
01:22:46.128 --> 01:22:48.629
I'm so sorry
I let this happen.

1428
01:22:48.714 --> 01:22:50.464
- We love you too. Mom.
- I love you. honey.

1429
01:22:50.549 --> 01:22:52.925
I promise.
everything's gonna be okay.

1430
01:22:54.345 --> 01:22:55.260
Sign.

1431
01:22:55.388 --> 01:22:58.180
I can't. My hands are tied.

1432

1433
01:23:30.089 --> 01:23:31.505
Now what. Rebecca?

1434
01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:34.791
Now you got what you want.
will you let me go?

1435
01:23:34.885 --> 01:23:36.760
You know I can't do that.

1436
01:23:36.846 --> 01:23:40.556
You know I can't
leave any witnesses.

1437
01:23:40.641 --> 01:23:42.599
You knew that
this whole time.

1438
01:23:45.896 --> 01:23:47.730
But this was never
a negotiation.

1439
01:23:47.815 --> 01:23:49.973
That's what separates us.
you and me.

1440
01:23:50.067 --> 01:23:54.403
I had my rose-colored glasses
slapped off my face years ago.

1441
01:23:57.283 --> 01:23:59.316
Please. think about
what you're doing.

1442
01:23:59.410 --> 01:24:01.151
Can you live with this
on your conscience?

1443
01:24:01.245 --> 01:24:05.247
That pathetic whining tone
reminds me of your mother.

1444
01:24:05.332 --> 01:24:08.083
just after I gave her
that lethal dose.

1445
01:24:08.169 --> 01:24:09.334
What?

1446
01:24:09.462 --> 01:24:11.170
Oh.
(chuckling)

1447
01:24:11.297 --> 01:24:13.380
The look on your face
right now.

1448
01:24:13.466 --> 01:24:15.674
Even Lockhart Investments
couldn't put a price on that.

1449
01:24:15.801 --> 01:24:18.635
No. You psychotic bitch!

1450
01:24:20.389 --> 01:24:22.389
Growing up the way I did.
Madison.

1451
01:24:22.475 --> 01:24:25.675
it made me hard.
It made me ruthless.

1452
01:24:25.770 --> 01:24:28.896
Willing to do whatever it takes
to get my seat at the table.

1453
01:24:28.981 --> 01:24:30.856
You'll never understand
that kind of work ethic.

1454
01:24:30.983 --> 01:24:33.776
You're nothing
but a spoiled child!

1455
01:24:33.861 --> 01:24:35.519
You could never run
an investment firm. Rebecca.

1456
01:24:35.613 --> 01:24:37.571

what ruthless is.

Who's the trophy husband now?

(breathing heavily)

1466

Sometimes you gotta do
what you gotta do.

Hayley? Emmett?
Can you hear me?

Mom? Mom. we're okay!

Grandpa.

Did the police run out
of questions?

Dr. Lund give your dad
the all-clear?

For now. How 'bout you?

1476
01:26:00.072 --> 01:26:01.488
How's your forehead?

1477
01:26:01.574 --> 01:26:03.240
Oh. it's nothin'.
Just a bump.

1478

By the way...

1479

Dad. are you okay?

1481
01:26:22.094 --> 01:26:24.428
I had the most
wonderful dream.

1482

We were all
back together again.

1483

At the lake house.

Come on. let's go inside.
