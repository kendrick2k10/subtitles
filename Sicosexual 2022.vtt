00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:43.625
Hello...

4
00:00:44.708 --> 00:00:45.875
Marce.

5
00:00:56.083 --> 00:00:58.166
You are deaf.

6
00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:01.958
What are you doing?
Too much work or what?

7
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.791
- Finishing.
- Which reel are you at?

8
00:01:03.833 --> 00:01:04.874
Six.

9
00:01:04.916 --> 00:01:07.125
You're flying. very good.

10
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.375
Terror is my thing.

11
00:01:08.416 --> 00:01:12.625
Stop everything you are doing for a second
and search: "My life as a YouTuber".

12
00:01:13.125 --> 00:01:14.750
Ok. And this is...?

13
00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:17.041
Something incredible.
You're going to love it.

14
00:01:17.083 --> 00:01:18.833
Do you follow Jacques?

15
00:01:18.875 --> 00:01:21.166
- No. who is he?
- Go ahead. click on it.

16
00:01:21.458 --> 00:01:23.166
Hello!
Dear family of one's choice.

17
00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:25.750
Welcome to another chapter
From Jacques not Jackes.

18
00:01:25.833 --> 00:01:29.750
Yes. the one with the strange name.
today I have an anecdote that rocks.

19
00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:31.500
This is a special chapter for women

20
00:01:31.541 --> 00:01:33.708
Because you know
that I am a guardian of feminism

21
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.416
and is obvious because men...
we are suckers. have you noticed?

22
00:01:36.458 --> 00:01:38.166
Suckers of great proportions.

23
00:01:38.208 --> 00:01:41.166
Pay attention to this anecdote.
So. a friend of mine tells me

24
00:01:41.208 --> 00:01:42.625
she has a lifelong friend.

25
00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:45.208
One of those friendships that rarely
occur between a man and a woman.

26
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.875
She is getting close to 40.

27
00:01:46.916 --> 00:01:50.125
she is 37. she is close to 40
is almost... almost there.

28
00:01:50.625 --> 00:01:54.000
Recently she had an existential crisis.
You know what I'm talking about.

29
00:01:54.041 --> 00:01:56.208
Of those crises where
you ask yourself questions.

30
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.666
She has no children.
has not wanted to have children

31
00:01:58.708 --> 00:02:02.166
And was questioned with the following:
What if I want to have children later?

32
00:02:02.208 --> 00:02:04.958
But with whom. anyway?
What if my eggs get too old soon.

33
00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:06.666
Those crises. those questions.

34
00:02:06.708 --> 00:02:08.833
They went out one day in a friendly tone.

35
00:02:08.874 --> 00:02:12.333
They had already had a few drinks.
A nugget goes. a nugget comes.

36
00:02:14.916 --> 00:02:18.208
Everyone was already euphoric.
they were all having fun

37
00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:22.708
And she stares at his best friend
and says something like:

38
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.000
Hey. you're a nice guy.
a very good friend.

39
00:02:25.041 --> 00:02:27.625
How if in a few years.
neither you nor I have had children

40
00:02:27.666 --> 00:02:29.666
so we make a pact of having a child
between the two of us.

41
00:02:29.708 --> 00:02:30.750
- Really?
- Seriously.

42
00:02:30.791 --> 00:02:31.750
Are you serious dumbass?

43
00:02:31.791 --> 00:02:33.750
Too crazy?
Can you imagine how beautiful he would be?

44
00:02:33.791 --> 00:02:36.750
They did not talk any more about it.
they arrived at a house

45
00:02:36.791 --> 00:02:39.625
and she decides that she is going
to lie down for a while on the sofa.

46
00:02:39.666 --> 00:02:42.041
When suddenly...
Out of the blue...

47
00:02:42.291 --> 00:02:44.041
She feels something hit her in the face.

48
00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:47.666
When she turns to look at
what is hitting her face

49
00:02:47.708 --> 00:02:49.583
she realizes that is a Dick Slap.

50
00:02:49.625 --> 00:02:52.375
Yes gentlemen. Dick Slap.

51
00:02:52.416 --> 00:02:54.291
Translation:
A slap with the cock.

52
00:02:54.333 --> 00:02:56.000
The dick. the pecker.
the willy wood.

53
00:02:56.041 --> 00:03:00.333
Her friend's penis
who has previously taken it out

54
00:03:00.375 --> 00:03:02.333
and with an erect penis
slaps her in the face.

55
00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:04.541
Can you imagine you are chilling
and have someone hit you on the face

56
00:03:04.583 --> 00:03:07.166
And that you turn
and what you see is a cock out of nowhere.

57
00:03:07.208 --> 00:03:09.625
Now you know what I mean.
Why are we men such a bunch of suckers?

58
00:03:09.666 --> 00:03:11.458
We are suckers. totally suckers.

59
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.625
Long live feminism. long live!

60
00:03:13.666 --> 00:03:16.375
I support them. I understand them.
when things like this happen.

61
00:03:16.416 --> 00:03:18.916
even though it makes me laugh.
I sympathize.

62
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.666
That is why I say to women
that I am a feminist guardian.

63
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.708
This is Jacques not Jackes.

64
00:03:23.791 --> 00:03:26.166
- Very good. isn't it?
- Yes.

65
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.166
No. seriously. it is very good.
Or am I stupid?

66
00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:30.166
- Yes. it is good. is good.
- Ah. well. good.

67
00:03:30.458 --> 00:03:33.458
Well. I also have to go to
finish that crappy commercial.

68
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.541
Good luck...

69
00:03:35.208 --> 00:03:36.458
Thank you...

70
00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:37.958
Bye.

71
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.000
Bye.

72
00:03:41.041 --> 00:03:42.500
What time do you arrive?

73
00:03:42.875 --> 00:03:45.333
Well. no. Yes. alright.

74
00:03:46.708 --> 00:03:48.750
Well. I love you. bye.

75
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.625
I was in the car driving.
handsfree with cell phone here

76
00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:56.708
and the screen is all illuminated.
which increased paranoia.

77
00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.125
I decided to make an escape plan.
Step 1.

78
00:03:59.166 --> 00:04:00.541
I grab my shit...

79
00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.208
The cab driver on the other side
of the bridge yells at me:

80
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.541
what happened?
Why did you jump?

81
00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:12.625
From the other side
of the bridge I answer:

82
00:04:12.666 --> 00:04:15.208
what did you throw me at me?
Tell me what you threw at me!

83
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.749
Nothing. nothing. I swear.
If you want we can call the police

84
00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:19.958
to investigate.
I have not done anything to you.

85
00:04:20.124 --> 00:04:22.625
Tell me what you threw at me!

86
00:04:25.791 --> 00:04:27.208
I didn't feel you coming!

87
00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:30.041
How are you doing?
What are you watching?

88
00:04:30.166 --> 00:04:33.125
A video of a man Valentina showed me.
Do you want to see?

89
00:04:34.916 --> 00:04:37.291
No. I'm exhausted.
We'll talk later.

90
00:04:50.666 --> 00:04:52.333
Why don't we go to bed.

91
00:04:53.041 --> 00:04:54.916
No. I'm smelling horrible.

92
00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.666
I love the way you smell.

93
00:04:56.833 --> 00:04:58.875
I'm going to take a bath.

94
00:05:00.291 --> 00:05:02.250
It's been a while since...

95
00:05:02.375 --> 00:05:05.375
I know...
But later. alright?

96
00:05:05.833 --> 00:05:08.375
Yes?
Better.

97
00:05:18.833 --> 00:05:21.541
THERE ARE THREE WAYS OF DOING THINGS:
THE RIGHT WAY. THE WRONG WAY AND MY WAY.

98
00:05:21.583 --> 00:05:24.458
OPPORTUNITIES MARK THE CROSSROADS
OF OUR LIVES. EVEN THE ONES WE LET GO.

99
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.791
SHOOTING NEW VIDEO WITH @MADAMEPERINE

100
00:05:26.833 --> 00:05:28.958
NO TO WAR.
YES TO WILD LOVE.

101
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.541
THERE ARE NO UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.
ONLY POORLY MADE QUESTIONS.

102
00:05:31.583 --> 00:05:34.375
Welcome to another chapter of:
Jacques no Jackes.

103
00:05:34.416 --> 00:05:38.125
Well. lately I have received Many.
many questions from women

104
00:05:38.166 --> 00:05:43.041
and all go towards the same thing:
what would be my advice to keep love alive

105
00:05:43.125 --> 00:05:45.541
And by love I mean...
Love.

106
00:05:45.583 --> 00:05:48.458
Women. you are not alone in this.
It happens to us men too

107
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.541
that from time to time.
the flame of passion dies.

108
00:05:50.583 --> 00:05:55.375
When you have been fucking
with the same person for a long time.

109
00:05:55.416 --> 00:05:58.208
the flame of passion is extinguished.

110
00:05:58.291 --> 00:06:00.458
But there are tips.
Have you heard of role-playing games?

111
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.833
When it becomes a little bit of an actor
in bed with your partner?

112
00:06:03.875 --> 00:06:05.875
That role-playing games.
different characters.

113
00:06:05.916 --> 00:06:10.000
when you have been a long time
with the same person you have to innovate.

114
00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:12.666
Various examples:
For example. ask your partner

115
00:06:12.708 --> 00:06:13.958
To dress up in black.

116
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.583
With a wig of this style
one can already begin to imagine

117
00:06:16.625 --> 00:06:18.833
that everything is bigger.
everything is more tasty.

118
00:06:18.875 --> 00:06:19.916
everything is thicker.

119
00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.416
If what you like is the sea.
and the adventure at sea.

120
00:06:22.458 --> 00:06:25.333
then it occurs to me
that you could play... pirates.

121
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.833
I am the pirate that will
rescue you from the plank

122
00:06:28.166 --> 00:06:29.791
and I'm going to give it to you
like a board.

123
00:06:29.833 --> 00:06:33.041
And there are some women.
or men. who like danger.

124
00:06:33.083 --> 00:06:36.500
then suddenly feel
that they are going to...

125
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.375
be forced in the peace
of your home by a...

126
00:06:40.416 --> 00:06:42.458
guetto boy who comes
to attack them... Anyway...

127
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.416
Think. improvise. play
and you will see that sex

128
00:06:46.458 --> 00:06:49.708
will be renewed.
Women. call the shots!

129
00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.833
Hold on to any idea
you've seen around here.

130
00:06:51.875 --> 00:06:53.958
Look for your man and surprise

131
00:06:54.041 --> 00:06:55.916
and I'll see you
in the next chapter of:

132
00:06:56.208 --> 00:06:57.916
Jacques no Jackes.

133
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Javier?

134
00:07:27.791 --> 00:07:28.875
Hello. my love.

135
00:07:29.125 --> 00:07:30.041
Hello.

136
00:07:32.875 --> 00:07:34.125
What are you doing here?

137
00:07:34.291 --> 00:07:35.750
I came to surprise you.

138
00:07:36.833 --> 00:07:38.166
What surprise?

139
00:07:47.791 --> 00:07:48.958
Do you like it?

140
00:07:52.416 --> 00:07:56.666
Marcela. it's not a good time
for a surprise. Marce.

141
00:07:56.708 --> 00:07:59.041
It is the perfect moment for a surprise.

142
00:08:24.208 --> 00:08:25.708
Let me explain.

143
00:08:35.666 --> 00:08:37.208
Son of a bitch.

144
00:10:05.833 --> 00:10:08.416
Yes. Marcela.
I want the sounds of silence

145
00:10:08.458 --> 00:10:11.083
to be equally disturbing
as the loud sounds.

146
00:10:11.208 --> 00:10:13.333
I want the soundscape
to be terrifying.

147
00:10:13.375 --> 00:10:14.750
Make it a disturbing horror...

148
00:10:14.791 --> 00:10:17.166
Marce. she is looking for you.

149
00:10:17.208 --> 00:10:18.000
What for?

150
00:10:18.041 --> 00:10:18.958
I don't know.

151
00:10:19.416 --> 00:10:20.958
Are you listening. Marcela?

152
00:10:21.083 --> 00:10:25.458
Yes. if it goes on.
you want the soundscape to be disturbing.

153
00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:27.916
Yes. but it has to be complemented
with the graphic images

154
00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.708
We have. or we would have nothing.

155
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.666
Ok.

156
00:10:33.291 --> 00:10:34.833
- How are you doing?
- Good.

157
00:10:35.916 --> 00:10:37.000
Are you sure?

158
00:10:38.166 --> 00:10:39.458
Why do you ask?

159
00:10:40.625 --> 00:10:45.916
I don't know. because lately I see you
out of your element. in a low mood.

160
00:10:46.041 --> 00:10:48.333
I don't know. that's why I ask.
Is everything all right?

161
00:10:48.416 --> 00:10:49.250
All good.

162
00:10:49.333 --> 00:10:51.958
Look. I know that breaking up
with the boyfriend is very difficult

163
00:10:52.166 --> 00:10:54.791
and it must be much. much worse
to find him with another woman.

164
00:10:54.833 --> 00:10:56.958
I wouldn't know what to do.
I would be devastated.

165
00:10:57.291 --> 00:10:58.458
I am alright.

166
00:11:05.666 --> 00:11:08.791
Look.
it's okay to not be okay.

167
00:11:09.125 --> 00:11:10.125
is normal.

168
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.166
When I ended my marriage.

169
00:11:12.208 --> 00:11:15.166
I wanted to leave that house
with all my fucking might.

170
00:11:15.458 --> 00:11:17.833
I was lost for a long time.
I was not alright.

171
00:11:19.291 --> 00:11:20.875
I am fine. Ana.

172
00:11:22.541 --> 00:11:25.208
You don't have to go through
all this all by yourself. don't you?

173
00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:28.083
You can count with me.
We can go for a glass of wine. talk.

174
00:11:28.791 --> 00:11:30.291
you know. don't you?

175
00:11:30.708 --> 00:11:32.083
Yes. thank you.

176
00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:36.250
Why don't you take a few days off?

177
00:11:36.541 --> 00:11:40.041
A long weekend. that way
you get here recharged on Monday.

178
00:11:40.375 --> 00:11:42.250
I would really prefer not to.

179
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:45.500
Well. yes.
maybe working is better for you.

180
00:11:45.541 --> 00:11:47.458
Speaking of which.
how is the film coming along?

181
00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.666
They want it now. don't they?
If you need anything let me know.

182
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:54.833
And we have to be united
because men are...

183
00:11:55.041 --> 00:11:56.625
a piece of crap.

184
00:11:57.916 --> 00:12:00.750
Did he really tell you that?
Well. everybody knows

185
00:12:00.791 --> 00:12:03.416
that gossip in that office is awful.
What a pain in the ass

186
00:12:03.458 --> 00:12:06.166
and I'll tell you one thing:
since you earned that award

187
00:12:06.208 --> 00:12:08.500
people have done nothing
but think on how to make you fall.

188
00:12:08.541 --> 00:12:10.125
It is not an award.

189
00:12:10.708 --> 00:12:12.916
It is an award just for you.
but you know

190
00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.375
how envious people are here.

191
00:12:14.416 --> 00:12:19.291
JACQUES HAS POSTED A NEW VIDEO.
NOW.

192
00:12:19.333 --> 00:12:20.625
Is it important?

193
00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:24.791
No seriously. all good.
it's all right.

194
00:12:24.833 --> 00:12:26.291
No. no. everything is fine.

195
00:12:26.625 --> 00:12:28.250
And your parents.
have you already told them?

196
00:12:28.291 --> 00:12:29.791
No. I have not been able to.

197
00:12:29.833 --> 00:12:32.958
No. Marcela!
That's bullshit!

198
00:12:33.041 --> 00:12:36.458
Your parents are going to die.
They love Javier.

199
00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.458
I mean. seriously.
it will give them a bad depression

200
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.750
and especially your mom.

201
00:12:39.791 --> 00:12:41.375
Yes. she wanted to marry him.

202
00:12:41.583 --> 00:12:43.666
Really. every day your mom is like:

203
00:12:43.833 --> 00:12:46.125
Javier this. Javier that.
Javiercito. Javiersote.

204
00:12:46.166 --> 00:12:47.375
Javier is amazing...

205
00:12:47.416 --> 00:12:51.333
Amazing. unfaithful but amazing.
Who's going to put up with my mom.

206
00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:52.541
Why?

207
00:12:53.291 --> 00:12:54.833
She's going to say it's my fault.

208
00:12:56.291 --> 00:12:59.250
What? What?
Your fault? No.

209
00:12:59.541 --> 00:13:00.291
Always.

210
00:13:00.333 --> 00:13:02.458
No. no. no. no. you're kidding me.
You are wrong

211
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:03.875
What do you mean. always?

212
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.250
It's always my fault.

213
00:13:05.458 --> 00:13:07.583
Marcela. no!
Look at me.

214
00:13:07.666 --> 00:13:10.083
Blame this faggot.
In other words. is it your fault

215
00:13:10.125 --> 00:13:11.750
that the man has fucked
another old chick?

216
00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:13.791
That means
that he was not well cared for.

217
00:13:14.458 --> 00:13:18.125
What?
No. no. no. no. no.

218
00:13:18.166 --> 00:13:20.291
seriously. you are wrong.
You are crazy.

219
00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:22.750
It is impossible for them to say that.

220
00:13:23.583 --> 00:13:26.708
No. they will say that. In addition.
they will ask me what I am going to do.

221
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:27.958
Do of what?

222
00:13:29.208 --> 00:13:30.875
Who I am going to marry with.

223
00:13:31.125 --> 00:13:33.541
No. no. no. no.
that's a bad plan. seriously.

224
00:13:35.583 --> 00:13:37.500
Well. I think that...
is necessary

225
00:13:37.541 --> 00:13:39.666
because it's already kind of intense.
isn't it?

226
00:13:39.791 --> 00:13:41.541
Yes. I'm coming.

227
00:13:43.458 --> 00:13:45.416
Well.
truthfully today is not an easy day.

228
00:13:45.458 --> 00:13:47.541
today I have news that are not very good

229
00:13:47.583 --> 00:13:49.791
I was about to
not to record anything today.

230
00:13:49.916 --> 00:13:51.291
I don't have the energy.

231
00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.625
Yesterday I broke up with Alexandra.
You know.

232
00:13:54.666 --> 00:13:57.375
Alexandra my girlfriend.
we are not doing well.

233
00:13:57.916 --> 00:14:01.416
We are no longer well. we were denying it.
we were ignoring the subject.

234
00:14:01.458 --> 00:14:03.458
But then. the time has come
to confront the truth.

235
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.458
Finally. yesterday we talked about it.

236
00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:09.541
and we concluded that the best thing to do
was to... Well. that. break up.

237
00:14:09.583 --> 00:14:12.333
I was not expecting it because.
this time we had illusions.

238
00:14:12.375 --> 00:14:14.083
I thought this was going to be...

239
00:14:14.541 --> 00:14:17.875
Relax. it was a mutual agreement
and no one was to blame.

240
00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958
Because normally
when there are breakups.

241
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.125
people want to blame someone.

242
00:14:23.166 --> 00:14:27.500
it was your fault because you didn't do.
This is not the case.

243
00:14:28.125 --> 00:14:30.791
Simply. we no longer had
to be together

244
00:14:30.833 --> 00:14:32.791
and we discovered it.
Last night we talked about it

245
00:14:32.833 --> 00:14:35.416
and it's still hard all the same.
Everything happens for a reason.

246
00:14:35.458 --> 00:14:39.708
Meeting Alexandra was wonderful
because she taught me many things.

247
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:44.000
I am truly grateful
of everything I experienced with her.

248
00:14:44.625 --> 00:14:47.083
Do not judge her.
Keep following her.

249
00:14:47.125 --> 00:14:50.500
Remember:
Alexandra MackeUp Tips.

250
00:14:50.541 --> 00:14:53.041
Love her as I'll keep loving her.

251
00:14:53.208 --> 00:14:56.166
Then.
I will accept with dignity that...

252
00:14:56.208 --> 00:14:58.250
this had to happen
and that's it

253
00:14:58.291 --> 00:15:01.458
and I will assume that she is no the one.
And maybe the one

254
00:15:01.916 --> 00:15:05.000
has not reached me.
well. I'm sure she hasn't reached me.

255
00:15:05.083 --> 00:15:07.416
Who knows.
maybe the woman who is for me

256
00:15:07.541 --> 00:15:10.208
is watching me right now
and in that case I want to tell you:

257
00:15:10.291 --> 00:15:11.708
I am here.

258
00:15:12.625 --> 00:15:14.791
I'm waiting for you
with open arms.

259
00:15:14.916 --> 00:15:17.000
That I can't wait
for you to come into my life.

260
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:21.416
Marcela!
What are you doing?

261
00:15:21.458 --> 00:15:23.875
You shit while watching
a video On YouTube or what?

262
00:15:23.916 --> 00:15:26.791
I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY
WHAT YOU ARE GOING THROUGH.

263
00:15:26.833 --> 00:15:33.708
I ALSO HOPE TO FIND THE MAN FOR ME SOON.
BE STRONG. I'M HERE FOR YOU.

264
00:15:38.416 --> 00:15:40.708
HAS HE ALREADY LEFT?

265
00:15:44.583 --> 00:15:46.125
NO. HE IS STILL GETTING HIS STUFF

266
00:15:46.166 --> 00:15:47.541
SUPPOSEDLY

267
00:15:56.041 --> 00:15:57.791
Do you know where my stuff is?

268
00:15:58.333 --> 00:15:59.500
Which ones?

269
00:16:10.333 --> 00:16:12.083
Can we talk before I leave?

270
00:16:12.541 --> 00:16:13.875
NOW HE WANTS TO TALK.

271
00:16:13.916 --> 00:16:15.000
Of what?

272
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:31.666
Look. from the bottom of my heart.
forgive me for everything that happened.

273
00:16:33.458 --> 00:16:35.541
For cheating on me with that bitch?

274
00:16:38.291 --> 00:16:40.416
I swear I didn't want
things to end up like this.

275
00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:42.416
I am feeling very bad.

276
00:16:44.208 --> 00:16:48.125
HE FEELS SUPER BAD. POOR.
MOTHERFUCKING. SHITTY ASSHOLE.

277
00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:51.666
I never thought
you would find out that way.

278
00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:53.375
And really. I didn't have the soul...

279
00:16:53.416 --> 00:16:56.958
THE BITCH HAS A NAME
...TO TELL I WAS INTERESTED IN EMILIA.

280
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.166
Ah. the bitch has a name.
THE BITCH'S NAME IS EMILIA.

281
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.583
Don't call her that.

282
00:17:05.458 --> 00:17:07.541
I'll call her however I want.
bitch.

283
00:17:08.208 --> 00:17:10.041
She even has a bitch's name.

284
00:17:13.708 --> 00:17:15.708
Well. in any case.
I wanted to apologize.

285
00:17:15.749 --> 00:17:18.166
And that you knew.
that I feel bad about this.

286
00:17:21.666 --> 00:17:23.749
You know what?
Don't apologize.

287
00:17:25.666 --> 00:17:28.708
What did you think?
That a lame-ass apology

288
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:31.291
would make me forget that you cheated
on me with another woman in your house?

289
00:17:31.333 --> 00:17:33.166
That I was going to tell you
"Everything's alright"

290
00:17:33.208 --> 00:17:36.041
To make you feel good about yourself?
And could you be at ease with her?

291
00:17:37.041 --> 00:17:38.458
Did you think that?

292
00:17:43.833 --> 00:17:47.083
MANY THANKS. MARCE. PEOPLE LIKE YOU
GIVE ME STRENGTH TO KEEP GOING.

293
00:17:47.125 --> 00:17:50.000
AND WHO KNOWS.
MAYBE YOU ARE THE PERSON I'M LOOKING FOR.

294
00:17:50.083 --> 00:17:51.625
What are you doing?

295
00:17:52.791 --> 00:17:55.125
Are you still here?
What more do you want?

296
00:17:55.291 --> 00:17:56.916
Let's leave it at that.

297
00:18:19.041 --> 00:18:20.291
I love you.

298
00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:22.833
Aha. thank you.

299
00:18:31.041 --> 00:18:35.458
YES. WHO KNOWS.

300
00:18:40.791 --> 00:18:43.333
You're being serious. Vale.
I don't believe you.

301
00:18:43.458 --> 00:18:46.041
No. no. no. look.
I don't have to convince you of anything

302
00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:49.875
because we are here with the one
who experienced it firsthand.

303
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.541
- What an asshole!
- How cheeky.

304
00:18:52.666 --> 00:18:54.708
- No. no. listen.
I am sorry but that's nothing.

305
00:18:54.791 --> 00:18:56.083
Don't you remember Jaime.

306
00:18:56.125 --> 00:18:59.750
who fucked half of the Bogota's
faggot-cracy while we were together

307
00:18:59.791 --> 00:19:02.750
and then came
dragged away asking me for forgiveness.

308
00:19:03.208 --> 00:19:05.958
Marce. you have to accept that is worse.

309
00:19:06.041 --> 00:19:07.166
No.

310
00:19:07.208 --> 00:19:10.125
What you are saying
is not worse than what happened to Marce.

311
00:19:10.166 --> 00:19:13.416
Did you walk in and saw him on all fours
with another man standing behind him?

312
00:19:13.458 --> 00:19:16.916
Ok yes. yes.
a very nice topic and all.

313
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.791
but I believe that no one here
needs listen to that. right?

314
00:19:19.875 --> 00:19:22.250
And you...
stop being a baby

315
00:19:22.291 --> 00:19:24.000
I mean. that's nothing. Oscar.

316
00:19:24.041 --> 00:19:27.166
Besides. you found you were being
cheated on through Facebook.

317
00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:29.250
But Marce. she experienced it firsthand.

318
00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:30.625
Live and direct.

319
00:19:30.666 --> 00:19:35.541
So what. You are attacking
the gay of the table again. as usual.

320
00:19:35.666 --> 00:19:40.625
Marce. don't be like that. okay?
You can trust us.

321
00:19:40.666 --> 00:19:42.750
We know how much that hurts. right?

322
00:19:42.833 --> 00:19:44.583
- Yes totally.
- No. I am fine.

323
00:19:44.666 --> 00:19:45.666
- Are you sure?

324
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:48.541
Yes. actually.
I'm dating someone.

325
00:19:49.166 --> 00:19:51.541
- Really?
- So fast?

326
00:19:52.208 --> 00:19:54.416
I would be in deep shit.

327
00:19:54.458 --> 00:19:57.375
Totally! Actually. I don't know
what you are doing here with us.

328
00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:58.625
You do not remember...

329
00:19:58.666 --> 00:20:02.000
Let her talk. Oscar.

330
00:20:02.041 --> 00:20:04.750
- I'm not going to say anything anymore.
- Tell us who your suitor is.

331
00:20:04.791 --> 00:20:07.291
I don't want to talk about him now.
we are just getting started.

332
00:20:07.333 --> 00:20:09.791
- C'mon. tell us.
- Show us pictures or something.

333
00:20:09.833 --> 00:20:11.291
I feel embarrassed.

334
00:20:11.333 --> 00:20:14.250
Nothing could be worse
than what happened with Vale

335
00:20:14.291 --> 00:20:16.000
that the ex-boyfriend had a wife.

336
00:20:16.041 --> 00:20:18.166
- Totally!
- Or is it?

337
00:20:18.333 --> 00:20:19.583
He is a YouTuber.

338
00:20:19.666 --> 00:20:20.875
What?!

339
00:20:21.458 --> 00:20:22.333
A YouTuber?

340
00:20:22.375 --> 00:20:25.708
He's a YouTuber. Well. now
you have to show us pictures.

341
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:28.375
Because. if he has YouTube.
he has Instagram. right?

342
00:20:28.416 --> 00:20:29.541
Totally.

343
00:20:29.666 --> 00:20:31.000
Are you really dating him?

344
00:20:31.041 --> 00:20:32.333
Yes.

345
00:20:32.791 --> 00:20:34.625
Girl. why didn't you tell me before?

346
00:20:34.666 --> 00:20:36.666
- I'm telling you now.
- Valen. relax baby!

347
00:20:36.708 --> 00:20:39.250
You don't have to be
the first to know everytime.

348
00:20:39.666 --> 00:20:42.583
- Uy. he's really hot.
- He looks great.

349
00:20:42.625 --> 00:20:44.208
Not bad for a YouTuber.

350
00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:46.166
You had it in your pocket. didn't you?

351
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.291
JACQUES HAS POSTED A NEW VIDEO.

352
00:20:55.125 --> 00:20:56.791
Hello.
family of one's choice.

353
00:20:56.916 --> 00:20:59.083
You may ask
why am I so elegant today?

354
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.416
Is a great look. no?

355
00:21:00.458 --> 00:21:03.333

Well. more ladies. well more girls.

the pre-launch of my book.

359
00:21:09.833 --> 00:21:12.500
because you know that I have been
a chatterbox with that book. right?

360
00:21:12.583 --> 00:21:16.166
My book this and my book that.
That I just don't know how to finish it.

361
00:21:16.208 --> 00:21:17.958
I don't know that.
That is fucking amazing.

362
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
And yes...
It is fucking amazing.

363
00:21:20.083 --> 00:21:22.208

364
00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:23.875

And the cherry on top of the dessert.

367
00:21:29.791 --> 00:21:31.166
Well. the fucking cherry.

368
00:21:31.208 --> 00:21:33.750

to be signing autographs.

369
00:21:33.791 --> 00:21:36.000
So. you buy the book

Meanwhile. today 3:00 pm.

380
00:22:07.208 --> 00:22:10.458
Librería Viajera 3:00 pm.
I'll be waiting for you.

381
00:22:10.541 --> 00:22:11.458
Come in.

382
00:22:12.875 --> 00:22:14.500
- Hello.
- Hello.

383
00:22:14.708 --> 00:22:16.416
Beautiful.

384
00:22:16.833 --> 00:22:18.583
- How are you doing?
- Fine. how about you?

385
00:22:18.708 --> 00:22:21.291
Very good. now better.

386
00:22:22.708 --> 00:22:24.208
To whom is the dedication?

387
00:22:24.333 --> 00:22:25.333
Marcela.

388
00:22:25.833 --> 00:22:28.666
Marcela.
what a beautiful name. Marcela.

389
00:22:28.916 --> 00:22:30.208
Thank you.

390
00:22:30.625 --> 00:22:31.750
No. seriously.

391
00:22:31.791 --> 00:22:33.333
You must tell that
to every girl. right?

392
00:22:33.375 --> 00:22:35.125
How can you think that?

393
00:22:36.583 --> 00:22:40.625
The truth is that... I just say it
to those named Marcela.

394
00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:44.583
Here.

395
00:22:44.708 --> 00:22:46.541
- Thank you.
- To you.

396
00:22:46.583 --> 00:22:49.083
Hey. aren't you going
to read what I wrote?

397
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.416
MARCELA: SHALL WE HAVE COFFEE?

398
00:22:54.833 --> 00:22:56.916
Do you have something to do right now?

399
00:22:57.916 --> 00:22:59.375
The book signing?

400
00:23:04.791 --> 00:23:05.916
The truth...

401
00:23:06.875 --> 00:23:07.791
It can wait.

402
00:23:12.291 --> 00:23:15.333
Then let's put Laura and Miguel
in the commercial of the 14th

403
00:23:15.375 --> 00:23:16.500
while Marcela...

404
00:23:16.666 --> 00:23:19.333
What are the possibilities

405
00:23:19.375 --> 00:23:21.833
the film could be ready
by the 14th and Jose can mix?

406
00:23:21.875 --> 00:23:23.750
Yes. I think that won't be a problem.

407
00:23:24.041 --> 00:23:27.041
Well. then I'm going to put you
in the commercial of the 15th.

408
00:23:27.083 --> 00:23:29.750
Let's get Marcela in here.
Those are 3 weeks after all?

409
00:23:29.791 --> 00:23:31.958
If it is 3 weeks.
I think it would be perfect. don't you?

410
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.375
Yes. I think even earlier.

411
00:23:33.416 --> 00:23:35.250
Ah. perfect.
so let's see how that progresses

412
00:23:35.291 --> 00:23:36.541
And we schedule the rest of the month.

413
00:23:36.583 --> 00:23:37.750
Thank you.

414
00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:40.958
- Ana!
- Yes?

415
00:23:41.708 --> 00:23:44.583
I just wanted to ask you.
I completely forgot

416
00:23:44.625 --> 00:23:48.083
that I have a doctor's appointment
and I wanted to know if I can go.

417
00:23:48.833 --> 00:23:50.416
Yes. of course you can go.

418
00:23:50.666 --> 00:23:52.375
But I would have liked it
if you told me earlier.

419
00:23:52.416 --> 00:23:54.083
Yes. I just completely forgot.

420
00:23:54.541 --> 00:23:56.583
- Alright. alright. no problem.
- Thank you.

421
00:23:57.291 --> 00:23:59.791
How are you doing?
You look better. you look good.

422
00:23:59.916 --> 00:24:01.833
Yes. everything is much better.

423
00:24:03.375 --> 00:24:05.958
Marce. I'm going to eat something.
I don't know if you want to...

424
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.125
- Where are you going?
- To see him.

425
00:24:08.166 --> 00:24:09.875
- Whom?
- Jack.

426
00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:13.500
What? In other words.
are you going to ditch work?

427
00:24:13.958 --> 00:24:15.208
And what did you tell Ana?

428
00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:16.458
That I had a doctor's appointment.

429
00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.416
What?
Did you lie to Ana?

430
00:24:18.583 --> 00:24:21.375
You never lie!
What's more. you never leave early!

431
00:24:21.416 --> 00:24:23.625
It is the pre-release of the book.
What do you want me to do?

432
00:24:23.666 --> 00:24:24.875
Well. tell him you can't go.

433
00:24:24.916 --> 00:24:25.541
I want to go.

434
00:24:25.583 --> 00:24:28.708
Ok. Ok. Ok.
I just want you to know

435
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:31.333
that I feel that you are
obsessing over this guy.

436
00:24:34.125 --> 00:24:35.083
You know what?

437
00:24:35.125 --> 00:24:37.625
You just don't know what it is that
someone sees you for who you are.

438
00:24:37.666 --> 00:24:40.458
No. no. you know what?
I'm worried that you're getting

439
00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.375
totally involved with a guy
that you don't know at all.

440
00:24:42.416 --> 00:24:44.625
- I know him. I know everything about him.
- Right.

441
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:48.208
I'm going to be late. talk to you later.

442
00:24:48.541 --> 00:24:50.625
Come on. come on. run.

443
00:25:04.875 --> 00:25:06.833
A lot of people came today. right?

444
00:25:08.458 --> 00:25:10.416
Don't you think he's great?

445
00:25:12.666 --> 00:25:14.250
He signed my book and everything!

446
00:25:14.375 --> 00:25:16.583
Tonight I will get home
and read it all.

447
00:25:17.125 --> 00:25:19.875
I want to know all about
how it ended with that Alexandra

448
00:25:19.916 --> 00:25:21.333
and how she treated him badly.

449
00:25:22.166 --> 00:25:24.083
I definitely do not understand
how can there be women

450
00:25:24.125 --> 00:25:27.666
who treat men like him badly.
He is so sensitive.

451
00:25:28.916 --> 00:25:31.875
Have you already bought the book?
It is very good.

452
00:25:34.541 --> 00:25:37.416
Well. enjoy it.
I had to take off work

453
00:25:37.458 --> 00:25:39.875
to be able to be here.
so it's my turn to run

454
00:25:39.916 --> 00:25:43.791
before I get scolded.
Anyway. I'll see you.

455
00:25:58.916 --> 00:26:00.125
Love...

456
00:26:04.583 --> 00:26:05.833
Another one. another one.

457
00:26:07.208 --> 00:26:09.416
That one is better.

458
00:26:10.583 --> 00:26:11.708
Thank you.

459
00:26:12.666 --> 00:26:13.291
Come in.

460
00:26:15.125 --> 00:26:16.333
What's your name?

461
00:26:16.875 --> 00:26:17.583
Angie.

462
00:26:17.625 --> 00:26:23.000
To Angie. you know. don't you?
Jacques no Jackes. Enjoy it. to you.

463
00:26:25.833 --> 00:26:28.666
Hi. how are you doing?
What is your name?

464
00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:31.041
Angie too. you are the second.

465
00:26:37.958 --> 00:26:38.875
Stay well.

466
00:26:39.625 --> 00:26:40.416
Hi.

467
00:26:44.291 --> 00:26:45.625
Your turn.

468
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.500
Hello beautiful. is everything OK?

469
00:26:50.583 --> 00:26:51.500
Yes.

470
00:26:54.583 --> 00:26:55.666
Thanks.

471
00:26:57.041 --> 00:26:58.708
In whose name
should I make the dedication?

472
00:26:58.791 --> 00:26:59.583
What?

473
00:27:00.375 --> 00:27:01.500
The book.

474
00:27:02.333 --> 00:27:03.791
Oh. em...

475
00:27:05.166 --> 00:27:07.208
The one who understands
what you are going through.

476
00:27:09.083 --> 00:27:11.333
- But you have a name. right?
- Yes.

477
00:27:14.333 --> 00:27:15.333
What is it?

478
00:27:15.791 --> 00:27:17.125
Marcela.

479
00:27:17.166 --> 00:27:20.125
Marcela. to whom...

480
00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:22.416
Ah. you are Marcela.

481
00:27:23.291 --> 00:27:25.375
You were the one who left me
that same comment.

482
00:27:25.416 --> 00:27:27.666
I understand what you are going through.
in my social media. right?

483
00:27:27.708 --> 00:27:28.291
Yes.

484
00:27:28.416 --> 00:27:32.208
Of course I remember you.
Thank you very much.

485
00:27:32.458 --> 00:27:33.458
Not at all.

486
00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:36.375
No. really. the truth is that one
doesn't really appreciate such comments.

487
00:27:36.916 --> 00:27:40.083
That day in particular.
it made me feel very good.

488
00:27:40.125 --> 00:27:41.375
Thank you.

489
00:27:41.625 --> 00:27:42.916
Can I take a picture with you?

490
00:27:42.958 --> 00:27:45.125
Sure. let's take the picture.
come over here.

491
00:27:46.541 --> 00:27:47.958
I'll take it if you want.

492
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.833
Ready?
One.

493
00:27:55.625 --> 00:27:57.666
another smiling.

494
00:28:00.541 --> 00:28:01.375
Bitch.

495
00:28:02.125 --> 00:28:03.375
That was a good one.

496
00:28:03.458 --> 00:28:04.125
Sorry.

497
00:28:04.166 --> 00:28:06.125
No. don't worry. is alright.
it is very good. Look.

498
00:28:06.166 --> 00:28:07.666
Check it out I like it.

499
00:28:08.625 --> 00:28:11.250
Yes. is really good.

500
00:28:12.458 --> 00:28:13.750
Thank you very much again.

501
00:28:13.791 --> 00:28:14.791
No thanks to you.

502
00:28:14.833 --> 00:28:15.916
Goodbye.

503
00:30:13.958 --> 00:30:15.291
Hello. mother?

504
00:30:18.958 --> 00:30:20.291
How is everything going?

505
00:30:21.125 --> 00:30:23.416
Well. exporting
to send to mix.

506
00:30:23.583 --> 00:30:25.416
Ah alright.
and how are you?

507
00:30:25.458 --> 00:30:26.333
Good.

508
00:30:26.541 --> 00:30:27.916
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

509
00:30:27.958 --> 00:30:30.833
I am receiving many comments
on your performance.

510
00:30:31.333 --> 00:30:32.250
Whose?

511
00:30:32.333 --> 00:30:34.208
From all over the world.
customers.

512
00:30:34.291 --> 00:30:37.541
The director changes his mind
a thousand times about the same thing.

513
00:30:37.583 --> 00:30:39.708
No. your colleagues also say
that you are on another planet.

514
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:42.041
Since I earned that award
everyone is looking for a way to screw me.

515
00:30:42.083 --> 00:30:45.000
Breathe. breathe.
that's what I came to tell you.

516
00:30:45.541 --> 00:30:48.708
I think you need time. that breakup
with your ex left you in a very bad shape.

517
00:30:48.875 --> 00:30:52.250
You need to find yourself.
Come back here in a more creative mindset.

518
00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.333
I don't think it is necessary Ana.

519
00:30:54.541 --> 00:30:58.041
You don't have to feel sorry for all this.
I also had to stop when I divorced.

520
00:30:58.125 --> 00:31:01.000
You have to go to find yourself
and figure out where you stand.

521
00:31:01.125 --> 00:31:04.125
I would really. really
prefer to keep working.

522
00:31:04.166 --> 00:31:06.458
I am not going to be your friend now.
I'm going to be your boss.

523
00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.333
That rest is mandatory.

524
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.666
And I'm not going to give you
an ordinary vacation

525
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:14.000
I'm going to give you a paid break
for all the great work you do for us.

526
00:31:14.083 --> 00:31:15.666
You will thank me later.

527
00:31:15.791 --> 00:31:17.750
So. you finish your work.
you take your sabbatical

528
00:31:17.791 --> 00:31:19.583
and we'll talk in a couple of weeks. ok?

529
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:20.833
Yes.

530
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:23.708
How is the book?

531
00:31:24.791 --> 00:31:25.708
Good.

532
00:31:26.666 --> 00:31:27.666
Shall I read it?

533
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:31.166
- No. I don't think is your type.
- You never know.

534
00:31:31.625 --> 00:31:35.041
I will read it to see if we have other
things to talk about when you come back.

535
00:31:35.416 --> 00:31:36.375
Bye.

536
00:32:24.166 --> 00:32:26.458
WHEN YOU BRING OUT YOUR INNER LANCE BASS.

537
00:32:46.708 --> 00:32:53.416

because I am addicted to... his videos.

569
00:35:14.083 --> 00:35:16.916
They make me laugh.
and they make me cry.

570
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.083
I feel that...
he's a person who understands me

571
00:35:20.166 --> 00:35:22.333
on the face of the earth.
Then.

572
00:35:22.416 --> 00:35:23.958
to be selected. event.

573
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.625
tt would be something...
unimaginable to me.

574
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.208
- Is that okay?

575
00:35:57.708 --> 00:35:59.250
- Yes. my love. that's perfect.

576
00:35:59.791 --> 00:36:01.125
- Did you arrive alone?

577
00:36:01.375 --> 00:36:01.958
- I don't know.

578
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:02.958
- Are you sure that's right?

579
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.958
- Yes.
Don't start.

580
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.166
If anything happens.
I move it from here.

00:36:07.208 --> 00:36:08.625
Let me help you with the bags.

And Javier?

584
00:36:13.791 --> 00:36:16.125
- Hello my love.
- Hi daddy.

585
00:36:16.541 --> 00:36:18.083

- I'm going to carry the suitcases
to your room.

592
00:36:29.541 --> 00:36:31.375
- You remember that the room
is occupied. don't you?

593
00:36:31.416 --> 00:36:32.958
She must be accommodated
in the other room.

594
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.958
- Marcelita. I'm so sorry.

595
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.916
Since we didn't know you were coming
we lend you your room to a photographer.

596
00:36:39.208 --> 00:36:41.833
is a good guy.
you will meet him later.

597
00:36:42.625 --> 00:36:43.625
Excuse me.

598
00:36:43.958 --> 00:36:44.875
- A photographer?

599
00:36:44.916 --> 00:36:45.958
Help me there.

600
00:36:47.166 --> 00:36:47.875
- Daughter.

601
00:36:47.916 --> 00:36:48.708
- Mother.

602
00:36:49.083 --> 00:36:50.291
- What happened to Javier?

603
00:36:50.791 --> 00:36:52.166
- He was unable to come.

604
00:36:52.291 --> 00:36:53.333
- How so?

605
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:54.916
- Work.

606
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:58.583
- Well. it's a long weekend
he could have taken a couple of days.

607
00:36:58.625 --> 00:36:59.875
- Yes. but he could not.

608
00:37:00.625 --> 00:37:02.083
You broke up. right?

609
00:37:02.625 --> 00:37:03.791
- Why do you say that?

610
00:37:03.916 --> 00:37:05.583
- Because Javier has stopped coming

611
00:37:05.625 --> 00:37:06.666
and you know it.

612
00:37:06.916 --> 00:37:08.583
- I don't want to talk about
it. mom. alright?

613
00:37:08.625 --> 00:37:11.541
Daddy!
Photographer of what?

614
00:37:15.708 --> 00:37:17.791
So if I don't fall on them by surprise.
I don't find out

615
00:37:17.833 --> 00:37:19.458
that they had given away
my room to a stranger.

616
00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:22.083
- Don't be exaggerated.
He is a photographer and

617
00:37:22.125 --> 00:37:24.541
your dad is very pleased with him.
He is a friend of the Peña family.

618
00:37:24.583 --> 00:37:25.333
It is temporary.

619
00:37:25.375 --> 00:37:29.250
Gloria. the girl is right.
we should have consulted you earlier.

620
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:30.375
Alright.

621
00:37:31.458 --> 00:37:32.458
Ready?

622
00:37:33.083 --> 00:37:33.958
Yes. let's go.

623
00:37:34.208 --> 00:37:37.000
Gloria. we are going to practice
with the girl. See you soon.

624
00:37:37.083 --> 00:37:39.166
Yes. of course.
go away and leave me alone.

625
00:37:39.208 --> 00:37:41.291
since Javier did not come
who is the one that accompanies me.

626
00:37:41.333 --> 00:37:42.458
And you insist with Javier.

627
00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.041
It's okay.
so if you want to.

628
00:37:44.166 --> 00:37:45.500
we stay and help you.

629
00:37:45.541 --> 00:37:48.250
No. no. no. no. no. no. no.
I don't want to ruin

630
00:37:48.291 --> 00:37:52.000
the father-daughter moment.
I'm used to it.

631
00:37:57.916 --> 00:37:58.708
Gloria...

632
00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:01.750
No. let's do one thing.

633
00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:05.458
when I come later we both play.

634
00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:06.166
No.

635
00:38:06.208 --> 00:38:07.125
No?

636
00:38:10.166 --> 00:38:12.458
And I tie you with the straps...

637
00:38:15.625 --> 00:38:16.416
I love you...

638
00:38:16.875 --> 00:38:18.500
Oh Pablo. you are terrible.

639
00:38:18.541 --> 00:38:19.541
Let's go.

640
00:38:19.833 --> 00:38:21.041
Yes. let's go.

641
00:38:21.625 --> 00:38:25.458
My darling... what's the name
of this boy... your boyfriend's name?

642
00:38:25.541 --> 00:38:27.500
This boy.
you know what it is called.

643
00:38:29.375 --> 00:38:30.833
My love the truth is that

644
00:38:30.875 --> 00:38:33.375
I can't get used
to you having a boyfriend.

645
00:38:34.125 --> 00:38:36.541
Then don't worry
because he is no longer my boyfriend.

646
00:38:36.583 --> 00:38:37.291
No?

647
00:38:37.416 --> 00:38:38.083
No.

648
00:38:38.125 --> 00:38:39.291
What happened?

649
00:38:39.666 --> 00:38:41.166
Well. well.
don't be so happy.

650
00:38:41.208 --> 00:38:43.791
No. I am not happy.

651
00:38:45.583 --> 00:38:46.958
but tell me what happened.

652
00:38:47.083 --> 00:38:48.041
With Javier?

653
00:38:48.083 --> 00:38:49.500
With Javier.

654
00:38:50.375 --> 00:38:51.541
It did not work.

655
00:38:52.541 --> 00:38:54.000
But... Are you okay?

656
00:38:55.041 --> 00:38:55.791
Yes.

657
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000
Are you sure?

658
00:38:57.625 --> 00:38:59.083
Yes. daddy. don't worry.

659
00:38:59.583 --> 00:39:00.500
Beautiful.

660
00:39:02.541 --> 00:39:03.500
Alright...

661
00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:05.916
Let's practice.

662
00:39:06.041 --> 00:39:08.875
I can't practice with your mom
because she doesn't like it.

663
00:39:10.166 --> 00:39:12.375
But you are here my love.
and I am sure

664
00:39:12.416 --> 00:39:13.958
that she is not going to be a nuisance.

665
00:39:14.125 --> 00:39:15.500
Good. need help?

666
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:31.958
Ready!

667
00:39:34.958 --> 00:39:37.625
Good.
like when you were little.

668
00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:39.875
Don't forget.

669
00:39:40.708 --> 00:39:43.083
feet shoulder width apart.

670
00:39:43.375 --> 00:39:46.083
semi-flexed arms.
and don't forget to always

671
00:39:46.125 --> 00:39:48.916
support the right hand and the revolver
on the left hand.

672
00:39:48.958 --> 00:39:51.333
- Okay.
- Ok. this is the position.

673
00:39:51.666 --> 00:39:52.458
C'mon.

674
00:39:53.875 --> 00:39:57.625
That's it. hit it there. that's it.

675
00:39:58.541 --> 00:40:00.708
And don't forget to breathe.

676
00:40:07.208 --> 00:40:11.333
Calm love. is the first one.
Breathe.

677
00:40:14.666 --> 00:40:15.833
Pablo!

678
00:40:17.166 --> 00:40:18.208
Pablo!

679
00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.000
Yes. my love. tell me.

680
00:40:20.041 --> 00:40:22.083
Love. the stove jammed again.

00:40:24.125 --> 00:40:25.416
Ok love. I'm coming.

682
00:40:25.541 --> 00:40:28.541
No. now!
I have to cook the chicken.

683
00:40:29.125 --> 00:40:32.041
Okay. alright.
I'm coming.

684
00:40:32.833 --> 00:40:33.583
God.

685
00:40:34.625 --> 00:40:37.166
Don't forget to breathe.

686
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:28.208
My mom was telling me
about your tenant.

687
00:41:28.666 --> 00:41:30.250
Tell me who he is.

688
00:41:31.125 --> 00:41:34.541
He is a very talented photographer.
A friend of the Peña family.

689
00:41:35.958 --> 00:41:37.750
I think he is staying Nearby.

690
00:41:37.791 --> 00:41:40.041
I even invited him to dinner tonight.

691
00:41:42.791 --> 00:41:45.500
I hope Marcela won't start smoking.

692
00:41:46.291 --> 00:41:49.333
No Gloria.
why would you think that?

693
00:41:53.208 --> 00:41:54.166
Are you smoking?

694
00:41:54.208 --> 00:41:55.416
Only with you daddy.

695
00:41:56.166 --> 00:41:57.416
Do you know who you are?

696
00:41:59.041 --> 00:42:00.250
You are my daughter

697
00:42:01.166 --> 00:42:02.708
And I know you.

698
00:42:03.375 --> 00:42:05.916
and I know you're not going through
a good time.

699
00:42:06.125 --> 00:42:07.875
even if you tell me you're fine.

700
00:42:07.958 --> 00:42:09.500
I know better.

701
00:42:11.041 --> 00:42:14.500
Darling. it happened to me too
before I met your mom.

702
00:42:14.583 --> 00:42:18.416
When I divorced I felt very bad.

703
00:42:18.708 --> 00:42:20.416
I felt terrible.

704
00:42:20.541 --> 00:42:24.125
I thought I had a sign
on the forehead that said:

705
00:42:24.416 --> 00:42:27.208
"This man has no future".

706
00:42:27.625 --> 00:42:31.666
Negative thoughts began.

707
00:42:33.833 --> 00:42:35.541
and I did things that were not right.

708
00:42:36.416 --> 00:42:40.000
very bad things
but fortunately I came to my senses.

709
00:42:40.583 --> 00:42:44.125
I know that things with Javier ended.

710
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:50.583
but it happens sometimes.
life is not always as you want it to be.

711
00:42:54.083 --> 00:42:57.250
If I had not had
that failure with my first wife

712
00:42:57.291 --> 00:43:00.916
I am sure that...
today could not make your mom happy.

713
00:43:04.041 --> 00:43:04.875
Daughter.

714
00:43:06.291 --> 00:43:07.125
I love you.

715
00:43:11.125 --> 00:43:13.333
Finish the cigarette
and let's go inside

716
00:43:13.375 --> 00:43:15.041
it is getting very cold.

717
00:43:27.208 --> 00:43:29.833
Well. help yourselves
because it will get cold.

718
00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:31.750
- Please.
- Enjoy your meal.

719
00:43:35.041 --> 00:43:37.416
So Michel.
how did you meet my dad?

720
00:43:37.541 --> 00:43:40.000
It is a story that is not very long.

721
00:43:40.083 --> 00:43:41.333
is kind of funny. I think.

722
00:43:41.375 --> 00:43:44.458
Michel and I are supposedly
worked together years ago

723
00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:48.000
But the truth Michel. excuse me.
I do not remember.

724
00:43:48.041 --> 00:43:49.333
No.
but you don't have to remember.

725
00:43:49.375 --> 00:43:51.250
I was a humble photography assistant.

726
00:43:51.291 --> 00:43:54.750
Apparently Michel worked on the photos

727
00:43:54.791 --> 00:43:56.958
that were used on the cover
of the CD I produced.

728
00:43:57.166 --> 00:43:58.625
At that time the covers

729
00:43:58.666 --> 00:44:00.958
were mostly done with photographs.
and did not use that pile

730
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.500
of graphic design and cartoons
that they use today.

731
00:44:03.833 --> 00:44:05.041
was more that style.

732
00:44:05.083 --> 00:44:08.500
So. they called me
to take the photos of the article

733
00:44:08.583 --> 00:44:09.958
of that music magazine...

734
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.416
That magazine
where your dad was announcing

735
00:44:12.458 --> 00:44:14.166
the withdrawal of the music.

736
00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:16.500
So. they called Michel to take pictures.

737
00:44:16.541 --> 00:44:17.916
- So. you took the pictures.
- Yes.

738
00:44:17.958 --> 00:44:19.750
No. no. no.
he did not take pictures.

739
00:44:19.833 --> 00:44:22.333
Made him look like the emperor of music.

740
00:44:23.625 --> 00:44:24.916
Don't overdo it either.

741
00:44:24.958 --> 00:44:27.500
No. no. I am not exaggerating.
You should have seen it. daughter.

742
00:44:27.666 --> 00:44:29.416
The girls were all over him.

743
00:44:29.916 --> 00:44:31.375
Not again with the same story.

744
00:44:31.416 --> 00:44:34.000
You are exaggerating my love.
and I know it's because you love me.

745
00:44:34.041 --> 00:44:35.208
I love you.

746
00:44:38.208 --> 00:44:41.166
And what do you do Marcela.
your dad told me

747
00:44:41.208 --> 00:44:44.250
that you recently won a very important
award. something like that.

748
00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:48.166
Eh. yes.
I work in sound design

749
00:44:48.208 --> 00:44:49.791
for movies and commercials above all.

750
00:44:49.833 --> 00:44:53.041
Truthfully she is very modest.
She won an award

751
00:44:53.083 --> 00:44:55.375
for making the sound design of a film.

752
00:44:55.708 --> 00:44:57.000
It was amazing.

753
00:44:57.041 --> 00:44:58.083
And can it be seen?

754
00:44:58.166 --> 00:44:59.875
Of course.
What's more. you have to see it.

755
00:44:59.916 --> 00:45:02.041
Yes. I surely want to see it.
is it available?

756
00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:06.583
It's unbelievable. such a handsome boy.
brilliant. smart like you

757
00:45:06.625 --> 00:45:08.125
and you just haven't married?

758
00:45:08.375 --> 00:45:10.083
- My goodness.
- Gloria please.

759
00:45:11.166 --> 00:45:13.083
What?
And what does it have to do with having

760
00:45:13.125 --> 00:45:15.333
In addition. if he was uncomfortable
you would have told me. wouldn't you?

761
00:45:15.375 --> 00:45:16.333
Am I being nosy?

762
00:45:16.375 --> 00:45:18.833
No. not at all
but if it is difficult for a person to

763
00:45:18.875 --> 00:45:21.791
be patient with my pace of work.
the things I like to do.

764
00:45:22.125 --> 00:45:23.541
It's hard to be in a relationship.

765
00:45:23.583 --> 00:45:27.041
That's my daughter you know.
she starts a project

766
00:45:27.083 --> 00:45:29.708
And becomes so engrossed
that she forgets the whole world.

767
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.583
She does not visit us.
Actually. you know.

768
00:45:32.625 --> 00:45:34.250
That is why I believe
she broke up with the boyfriend.

769
00:45:34.291 --> 00:45:35.000
Mom. no more.

770
00:45:35.041 --> 00:45:37.791
Gloria. I don't think we
have to talk about it. please.

771
00:45:38.083 --> 00:45:40.000
- No. but if you have...
- It is the truth.

772
00:45:40.458 --> 00:45:42.750
It is often very difficult
for people to understand

773
00:45:42.791 --> 00:45:45.125
our time.
our work pace

774
00:45:45.375 --> 00:45:47.458
and if the relationships become difficult.

775
00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:49.791
is more than normal.
is the artist's life. isn't it?

776
00:45:50.208 --> 00:45:54.041
Spoke like a true artist.
Let's toast to Michel.

777
00:45:54.208 --> 00:45:54.875
Cheers!

778
00:45:54.916 --> 00:45:55.791
Cheers!

779
00:45:56.166 --> 00:45:57.375
For your photo collection.

780
00:45:57.416 --> 00:46:00.291
Yes. to getting my series published or
to be able to exhibit it somewhere.

781
00:46:00.333 --> 00:46:02.083
So let's toast to the series.

782
00:46:02.125 --> 00:46:02.625
Cheers!

783
00:46:02.666 --> 00:46:05.250
And we're going to get someone
to publish it. of course.

784
00:46:06.208 --> 00:46:07.958
Why.
What are you working on?

785
00:46:08.166 --> 00:46:12.583
I am making a series of photos.
which can be a bit like...

786
00:46:13.166 --> 00:46:15.875
like a problem for some people.
they are a bit taboo.

787
00:46:15.916 --> 00:46:18.166
I am exploring female sexuality.

788
00:46:18.208 --> 00:46:20.625
These are amazing photos.

789
00:46:21.208 --> 00:46:23.375
Yes. they already told me
that my room is your room.

790
00:46:23.833 --> 00:46:26.708
I turned it into a dark room
for some time

791
00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:28.833
your dad very generously
allowed me to use.

792
00:46:29.458 --> 00:46:32.083
I think hit will be back back
to normal very soon.

793
00:46:32.333 --> 00:46:33.708
I would love to see them.

794
00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:36.041
Of course.
I'll show them to you whenever you want.

795
00:46:38.958 --> 00:46:40.833
And why did you choose that topic?

796
00:46:42.208 --> 00:46:44.583
Because I love women.
because...

797
00:46:45.083 --> 00:46:49.833
They have taken me to...
push the boundaries of beauty.

798
00:46:49.875 --> 00:46:53.250
understand it differently.
I think they are very powerful.

799
00:46:53.958 --> 00:46:55.041
Powerful as.

800
00:46:55.125 --> 00:46:59.291
From every point of view.
I think the shape of their body.

801
00:46:59.333 --> 00:47:04.166
their curves...
the way they get all of us men

802
00:47:04.416 --> 00:47:05.750
to do whatever it takes

803
00:47:05.791 --> 00:47:07.375
in order to get under their skirt.

804
00:47:07.458 --> 00:47:09.375
I think that makes them very powerful.

805
00:47:11.458 --> 00:47:14.208
And…
Are the women in your photos models?

806
00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:16.291
No. no. they are not models. no.

807
00:47:17.041 --> 00:47:19.958
I got tired of taking pictures of models.

808
00:47:20.125 --> 00:47:21.958
They are ordinary women.

809
00:47:22.833 --> 00:47:24.875
And they get naked for you?

810
00:47:25.125 --> 00:47:28.250
Yes. many times the link...

811
00:47:28.916 --> 00:47:30.166
the bond is emotional

812
00:47:30.208 --> 00:47:32.666
and after that we become friends and...

813
00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:36.833
Inadvertently. there can be
a sexual bond. why not.

814
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.083
I could not take nude photos.

815
00:47:40.208 --> 00:47:41.208
No. you don't think so?

816
00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:42.125
No.

817
00:47:42.208 --> 00:47:43.916
Well. they say it can be very liberating.

818
00:47:44.708 --> 00:47:46.500
But what like a selfie in
the bathroom?

819
00:47:47.041 --> 00:47:47.875
No.

820
00:47:48.708 --> 00:47:50.166
Perhaps an expert can help you.

821
00:47:51.833 --> 00:47:54.375
- Someone like you?
- Why not?

822
00:47:54.583 --> 00:47:58.125
Maybe one of these days
when your parents go on a trip.

823
00:47:58.291 --> 00:48:01.291
- We can. I don't know. explore.
- Maybe.

824
00:48:05.041 --> 00:48:05.958
Be careful.

825
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:06.916
Yes.

826
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:13.000
I WOULD LIKE TO MEET TO APOLOGIZE
FOR EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED.

827
00:48:13.041 --> 00:48:18.625
CAN WE GET TOGETHER
ONE OF THESE DAYS FOR A BEER?

828
00:48:32.416 --> 00:48:33.500
- Hello.
- Hello.

829
00:48:37.125 --> 00:48:38.875
- How are you doing?
- Well. and you?

830
00:48:38.916 --> 00:48:42.041
All good. Do you want to sit here
or we go to a table over there.

831
00:48:42.166 --> 00:48:43.250
Here is fine.

832
00:48:43.458 --> 00:48:44.291
Alright.

833
00:48:52.958 --> 00:48:54.291
You look very pretty.

834
00:48:54.333 --> 00:48:55.250
Thank you.

835
00:48:55.791 --> 00:48:57.041
Would you like to have a drink?

836
00:48:58.458 --> 00:48:59.583
A beer?

837
00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:02.375
Beer!
My friend!

838
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.416
Hey. do me a favor.

839
00:49:08.708 --> 00:49:10.500
Bro. hey.

840
00:49:13.791 --> 00:49:15.333
Hey. can I ask you a question?

841
00:49:15.375 --> 00:49:16.208
Ah. tell me.

842
00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:18.791
Who do you have to sleep with
in here to get a beer?

843
00:49:18.833 --> 00:49:20.291
I'll bring you one.

844
00:49:30.416 --> 00:49:31.625
Thank you!

845
00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:48.958
Don't stop. Jacques.

846
00:50:51.166 --> 00:50:52.458
What?

847
00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:54.083
Who the fuck is Jacques?

848
00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.416
Who the fuck is Jacques?

849
00:50:58.458 --> 00:51:00.041
What do you care who Jacques is?

850
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.416
Are you dating someone?

851
00:51:02.458 --> 00:51:05.000
What do you care
if I am dating someone?

852
00:51:14.708 --> 00:51:16.000
What's wrong with you?

853
00:51:16.875 --> 00:51:19.375
It happens. that you're crazy.

854
00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:21.625
Ah. I'm crazy?

855
00:51:21.708 --> 00:51:22.625
Yes. you are crazy.

856
00:51:22.666 --> 00:51:24.000
Hypocrisy in person.

857
00:51:24.041 --> 00:51:26.000
- Who? Me?
- Clearly you.

858
00:51:26.041 --> 00:51:28.875
Yes?
You called me Jacques.

859
00:51:29.041 --> 00:51:30.291
Where is your girlfriend?

860
00:51:30.333 --> 00:51:31.541
Don't get her in...

861
00:51:31.583 --> 00:51:34.125
You want to stick it in me.
but we can't talk about your girlfriend.

862
00:51:34.166 --> 00:51:35.875
Fuck. you called me Jacques!

863
00:51:35.916 --> 00:51:37.833
He sucks me. so what.

864
00:51:37.875 --> 00:51:41.041
So what? I suck you too.
You loved it when I sucked you off.

865
00:51:41.083 --> 00:51:41.958
No. no.

866
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000
Don't you remember when I did it to you?

867
00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:46.416
Since I met Jacques.
I realized that there was a part

868
00:51:46.458 --> 00:51:48.375
of me that I didn't know existed.

869
00:51:51.541 --> 00:51:53.500
I don't have to listen
to that shit of yours.

870
00:51:53.541 --> 00:51:55.916
That you didn't know existed.

871
00:51:58.958 --> 00:52:02.416
It's just that he's a much better
fuck than you.

872
00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:03.833
That's enough.

873
00:52:04.125 --> 00:52:06.500
He does not have that little problem
that you have to get it hard.

874
00:52:06.625 --> 00:52:07.708
I have no problem.

875
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:08.583
- No?
- No.

876
00:52:08.625 --> 00:52:10.625
Shall we call your girlfriend?
What does she say?

877
00:52:10.666 --> 00:52:13.375
Doesn't she tell you all the time
that it happens to everyone?

878
00:52:14.083 --> 00:52:16.958
What?
Did I hurt your feelings? Yes?

879
00:52:17.666 --> 00:52:20.541
Thank you for breaking up with me
because I met someone

880
00:52:20.583 --> 00:52:21.958
who fucks me as he wants.

881
00:52:22.291 --> 00:52:23.291
Yes?

882
00:52:23.458 --> 00:52:26.833
What are you going to do?
Now if you've got your güevas down?

883
00:52:57.166 --> 00:52:58.250
Tougher.

884
00:53:03.458 --> 00:53:04.416
More...

885
00:53:09.416 --> 00:53:10.583
Choke me.

886
00:53:12.833 --> 00:53:13.875
Choke me.

887
00:53:41.833 --> 00:53:46.000
I am worried about you. You are
taking this to a level of insanity.

888
00:53:47.583 --> 00:53:50.333
Good luck getting it hard
with your girlfriend now.

889
00:53:51.041 --> 00:53:52.750
Fuck you.

890
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.916
Hello. family of one's choice.
Welcome to another chapter of:

891
00:54:11.958 --> 00:54:14.625
"Jacques no Jackes"
Finally. the time has come

892
00:54:14.666 --> 00:54:16.458
to announce the winner of the contest.

893
00:54:16.541 --> 00:54:18.000
But before that I have to thank

894
00:54:18.041 --> 00:54:20.083
all those who sent their videos.
because the truthfully

895
00:54:20.125 --> 00:54:22.875
they were really wonderful.
It was very difficult to choose.

896
00:54:23.083 --> 00:54:26.583
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
I laughed. my eyes watered.

897
00:54:26.625 --> 00:54:29.625
I laughed again. I loved them.
but unfortunately

898
00:54:29.666 --> 00:54:34.000
there can only be one winner.
At last. the long-awaited moment...

899
00:54:34.041 --> 00:54:37.291
and the winner is:

900
00:54:37.333 --> 00:54:39.916
Marcela. Marcela Muñoz.

901
00:54:40.125 --> 00:54:45.125
Look. look. she showed off.
I have to confess that she did a great job

902
00:54:45.208 --> 00:54:47.458
did a crazy job.
We were dumbfounded

903
00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:51.166
when we saw it we all said;
she is undoubtedly the winner.

904
00:54:51.291 --> 00:54:52.833
So Marcela.
in a short time.

905
00:54:52.875 --> 00:54:55.166
watch out for your cell phone.
watch out for your networks.

906
00:54:55.333 --> 00:54:58.083
Because we will be contacting you.
Because you are coming with me

907
00:54:58.125 --> 00:55:00.500
to the launch of my book.
Because you're going to dance with me.

908
00:55:00.541 --> 00:55:03.583
Because you're going on an
unforgettable date with me.

909
00:55:03.708 --> 00:55:06.125
For the time being. Marcela.
you know this.

910
00:55:06.791 --> 00:55:07.958
You are my date.

911
00:55:20.958 --> 00:55:22.583
- Hello?
- Hello Marcela.

912
00:55:22.833 --> 00:55:24.583
- Yes?
- How are you doing? With Jacques.

913
00:55:24.791 --> 00:55:25.500
Hello.

914
00:55:26.041 --> 00:55:27.833
- Everything OK?
- Good and you?

915
00:55:27.958 --> 00:55:29.541
Fine. thank you very much.
Listen.

916
00:55:29.583 --> 00:55:31.375
I got you a car
to pick you up at your home

917
00:55:31.416 --> 00:55:33.083
and bring you here
to the event site. is it OK?

918
00:55:33.208 --> 00:55:34.000
OK.

919
00:55:34.041 --> 00:55:36.083
I'm sorry I couldn't pick you up.

920
00:55:36.375 --> 00:55:37.625
No. don't worry.

921
00:55:37.708 --> 00:55:39.625
The thing is that I am really busy
with the event.

922
00:55:39.958 --> 00:55:41.333
Yes. don't worry about me.

923
00:55:41.375 --> 00:55:42.875
Thank you for your understanding.
See you here.

924
00:55:42.958 --> 00:55:43.708
Okay.

925
00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:44.625
Okay. bye.

926
00:58:20.083 --> 00:58:21.791
- Hello?
- Hello Marcela?

927
00:58:21.833 --> 00:58:24.041
- Yes.
Hello Marcela. this is Cristina.

928
00:58:24.083 --> 00:58:26.000
Jacques' manager.
How is everything going?

929
00:58:26.375 --> 00:58:27.291
Good. and you?

930
00:58:27.333 --> 00:58:32.000
Everything good. Look. soon a car will
go to pick you up so. watch out for it.

931
00:58:32.333 --> 00:58:35.291
Ok and Jacques?

932
00:58:35.416 --> 00:58:38.083
He will be here waiting for you.
What happened is that because

933
00:58:38.125 --> 00:58:40.125
of all this hassle. he couldn't go.

934
00:58:40.166 --> 00:58:43.291
But he is very sorry with you
for not picking you up.

935
00:58:43.416 --> 00:58:44.625
Yes. don't worry.

936
00:58:44.666 --> 00:58:46.958
They're picking you up right now. okay?

937
00:58:47.250 --> 00:58:48.041
Good.

938
00:58:48.083 --> 00:58:49.083
Alright. bye.

939
00:59:05.208 --> 00:59:06.708
- Who is it for?
- To Natalia.

940
00:59:09.416 --> 00:59:10.458
Jacques. look.

941
00:59:12.333 --> 00:59:13.416
Good. good.

942
00:59:18.291 --> 00:59:19.125
Thank you.

943
00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:20.625
This one for whom?

944
00:59:20.666 --> 00:59:21.791
Marcela?

945
00:59:22.041 --> 00:59:22.708
Yes.

946
00:59:22.750 --> 00:59:24.791
Hi. I'm Cristina Jacques' manager.

947
00:59:25.333 --> 00:59:26.958
Oh. hi.

948
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.333
Thank you for participating
in the contest.

949
00:59:29.375 --> 00:59:31.750
Your video was amazing.
We all liked it.

950
00:59:31.791 --> 00:59:33.041
especially Jacques.

951
00:59:33.208 --> 00:59:34.125
Thank you.

952
00:59:34.333 --> 00:59:38.208
I'm going to see if he...
He is very busy.

953
00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:40.958
Yes. I can imagine.

954
00:59:41.541 --> 00:59:44.916
Hey but...
You look super pretty.

955
00:59:44.958 --> 00:59:45.916
Thank you.

956
00:59:46.250 --> 00:59:47.541
I'm going to go look for him.

957
00:59:48.583 --> 00:59:50.791
Jacques. come with me.

958
00:59:52.875 --> 00:59:55.541
Meet Marcela.
the winner of the contest.

959
00:59:55.625 --> 00:59:56.958
Hello. hi.

960
00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:58.375
How are you doing?
How was the ride here?

961
00:59:58.416 --> 00:59:59.500
- Good.
- Everything OK?

962
00:59:59.541 --> 01:00:02.125
You realize that we are
already trending on Twitter. right?

963
01:00:02.208 --> 01:00:03.208
Wonderful.

964
01:00:03.250 --> 01:00:04.750
Wonderful. but it worries me.

965
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:05.833
Why?

966
01:00:05.875 --> 01:00:07.375
Because the page will crash at any time

967
01:00:07.416 --> 01:00:09.250
and the streaming is not
going to be seen by anyone.

968
01:00:09.291 --> 01:00:10.333
Well. I'll solve it.

969
01:00:10.375 --> 01:00:11.791
So. what are you waiting for?

970
01:00:11.833 --> 01:00:13.166
I'm going to fix it.

971
01:00:23.041 --> 01:00:24.833
You read it then. yes?

972
01:00:27.083 --> 01:00:29.666
Marcela.
we have a preferential spot for you.

973
01:00:29.708 --> 01:00:30.958
Come this way.

974
01:00:40.083 --> 01:00:41.166
Would you like to have a drink?

975
01:00:41.791 --> 01:00:42.750
No thanks.

976
01:00:42.875 --> 01:00:44.625
Are you sure? Wine. water.

977
01:00:45.041 --> 01:00:45.833
Alright

978
01:00:45.875 --> 01:00:47.625
Wine.
Do me a favor.

979
01:00:47.666 --> 01:00:49.583
bring her a wine please.

980
01:00:50.333 --> 01:00:51.625
They will bring it to you.

981
01:00:59.291 --> 01:01:01.916
Hello and welcome to all.
thank you for being here.

982
01:01:02.208 --> 01:01:04.583
It's one thing to make videos
on YouTube and be alone.

983
01:01:04.625 --> 01:01:06.708
and it is another thing to have
an audience. so please forgive me

984
01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:07.833
if I'm a little nervous...

985
01:01:07.875 --> 01:01:08.750
I love you!

986
01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:11.750
Thank you. I love you too.

987
01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:14.375
So nothing. I just want to thank you all

988
01:01:14.416 --> 01:01:18.541
I really appreciate the support you
have given me watching my YouTube videos.

989
01:01:18.583 --> 01:01:21.125
supporting the channel.
The truth is that I started as a game

990
01:01:21.166 --> 01:01:24.750
and I didn't expect it to be
as successful as it has been.

991
01:01:24.791 --> 01:01:26.750
Even less the success the book has had.

992
01:01:26.791 --> 01:01:29.166
because that was a second step

993
01:01:29.208 --> 01:01:31.958
that I wasn't expecting.
And in doing so.

994
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.500
and seeing the public's reception.
yours.

995
01:01:34.583 --> 01:01:37.708
I want to tell you: thank you
very much for your support.

996
01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:41.333
for reading it. for buying it.
I am very happy to have your support.

997
01:01:41.416 --> 01:01:44.166
No. really. I think I'm not going to
bore you anymore

998
01:01:44.208 --> 01:01:48.750
with so much talk. If you liked it
then recommend it to your friends

999
01:01:48.791 --> 01:01:50.916
and if not to your enemies.
What difference does it make?

1000
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.125
Without further ado.
let the party begin. right?!

1001
01:01:53.291 --> 01:01:55.041
Thank you. thank you for being here.

1002
01:02:39.625 --> 01:02:40.666
Is everything Ok?

1003
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.041
People are having a good time.
aren't they?

1004
01:02:49.291 --> 01:02:49.958
Uh?

1005
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.083
People are having a good time.
aren't they?

1006
01:02:52.958 --> 01:02:55.750
So it seems.
great. isn't it?

1007
01:02:56.791 --> 01:02:59.291
How did I talk?
I made a fool of myself. didn't I?

1008
01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:15.583
Look who's here.

1009
01:03:21.708 --> 01:03:23.166
And who invited this one?

1010
01:03:23.375 --> 01:03:24.375
I don't know.

1011
01:03:25.125 --> 01:03:27.166
Hey. how's it going?

1012
01:03:27.375 --> 01:03:28.666
Alexa. how about you?

1013
01:03:28.708 --> 01:03:30.625
Good. how are you?

1014
01:03:31.291 --> 01:03:32.291
Divinely.

1015
01:03:32.333 --> 01:03:35.291
Congratulations. the book is
a complete success. isn't it?

1016
01:03:35.333 --> 01:03:37.583
Truthfully. we are very pleased.
Did you hear the lastest news?

1017
01:03:37.625 --> 01:03:38.458
No. what?

1018
01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:40.000
They are translating into english.

1019
01:03:40.041 --> 01:03:42.250
in a few months it will start selling
in the United States.

1020
01:03:42.291 --> 01:03:44.250
Is that so?
Very good.

1021
01:03:44.875 --> 01:03:45.875
Very good.

1022
01:03:45.916 --> 01:03:48.166
How nice!
And above all I congratulate Cristi

1023
01:03:48.208 --> 01:03:50.375
because I know that
without her you wouldn't do anything.

1024
01:03:51.208 --> 01:03:52.375
Yes. surely.

1025
01:03:52.416 --> 01:03:53.250
Of course!

1026
01:03:53.291 --> 01:03:54.583
No shit.

1027
01:03:54.791 --> 01:03:56.583
I'm sure they don't give a shit.

1028
01:03:59.750 --> 01:04:01.375
And your friend. who is she?

1029
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.500
So what are we becoming?

1030
01:04:11.666 --> 01:04:13.375
We haven't talked about it.

1031
01:04:13.791 --> 01:04:14.750
Ah.

1032
01:04:15.916 --> 01:04:17.000
well...

1033
01:04:17.625 --> 01:04:19.166
I wish you all the best.

1034
01:04:19.208 --> 01:04:23.833
Congratulations.
I hope the book keeps doing well.

1035
01:04:23.916 --> 01:04:24.500
Thank you.

1036
01:04:24.541 --> 01:04:25.875
Always wishing you the best.

1037
01:04:25.916 --> 01:04:27.416
The same to you.

1038
01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:31.333
- See you soon.
- Okay. Take advantage of the free drinks.

1039
01:04:31.583 --> 01:04:34.250
Yes. that's what I'm getting at.
finally something free. right?

1040
01:04:34.291 --> 01:04:36.625
- The way you like it.
- Yes.

1041
01:04:39.666 --> 01:04:41.375
Who does she think she is or what?

1042
01:04:42.708 --> 01:04:47.083
And what does it matter...
I didn't invite you.

1043
01:04:47.541 --> 01:04:49.000
I didn't invite you...

1044
01:04:53.166 --> 01:04:54.250
Pretty?

1045
01:04:55.375 --> 01:04:56.416
Do you want to leave?

1046
01:07:08.250 --> 01:07:10.208
So. how are you doing with that YouTuber?

1047
01:07:10.333 --> 01:07:11.291
I am not doing.

1048
01:07:11.916 --> 01:07:12.625
What?

1049
01:07:12.666 --> 01:07:14.041
How so?
What happened?

1050
01:07:14.083 --> 01:07:16.416
You were super thrilled
with this guy.

1051
01:07:16.541 --> 01:07:18.333
You know... Men.

1052
01:07:19.958 --> 01:07:21.125
You know I know.

1053
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:24.166
And... what about you?
How do you feel?

1054
01:07:24.291 --> 01:07:25.416
Don't worry.

1055
01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:28.250
Well. you weren't going to get
someone that fast anyway. right?

1056
01:07:28.333 --> 01:07:30.541
Besides. what a drag to have
a relationship with a YouTuber.

1057
01:07:30.583 --> 01:07:32.833
Imagine you taking pictures all day long

1058
01:07:32.875 --> 01:07:35.666
making videos... no. what a drag.

1059
01:07:35.875 --> 01:07:38.458
And did you fuck him?
That guy was so hot.

1060
01:07:38.541 --> 01:07:39.458
He was yummy.

1061
01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:40.708
No. it didn't come to that.

1062
01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:43.125
Didn't fuck him? Oh no...

1063
01:07:43.416 --> 01:07:45.041
You know that I have to fuck someone

1064
01:07:45.083 --> 01:07:48.166
to know if there is any chemistry
or something. you understand me?

1065
01:07:48.208 --> 01:07:50.083
- No seriously.
- He is about to start on the subject.

1066
01:07:50.125 --> 01:07:52.250
- Go talk about penises.
Can I borrow the bathroom?

1067
01:07:52.875 --> 01:07:54.916
- Don't you eat all the cheeses. you hear?
- Me?

1068
01:07:54.958 --> 01:07:57.000
Hey. did Javier call you or something?

1069
01:07:57.166 --> 01:07:58.625
No. he did not call me.

1070
01:08:01.625 --> 01:08:05.208
Marce...
Are there more of these cheeses?

1071
01:08:05.583 --> 01:08:08.208
Really Oscar. really no more

1072
01:08:08.250 --> 01:08:09.958
with the fucking cheeses.
- But is that...

1073
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.625
You have done nothing but eat the cheeses.
control yourself.

1074
01:08:12.666 --> 01:08:14.458
If you want. I'll go with you.

1075
01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:16.583
No. I'm going to get them.

1076
01:08:18.999 --> 01:08:23.624
Oh so good. this would be delicious
with a little bread.

1077
01:08:24.999 --> 01:08:27.083
Give me a little wine. Osquitar.

1078
01:09:17.416 --> 01:09:18.458
Vale?

1079
01:09:18.833 --> 01:09:21.333
Marce...
What is all this?

1080
01:09:21.583 --> 01:09:22.374
It is nothing.

1081
01:09:22.416 --> 01:09:24.999
I'm really worried about you.
Are you okay?

1082
01:09:25.041 --> 01:09:26.166
They were for a contest.

1083
01:09:26.208 --> 01:09:28.791
I know which contest they were for
and that was a while ago. Marcela.

1084
01:09:28.833 --> 01:09:32.499
Why do you have this guy's pictures here?
You are becoming obsessed.

1085
01:09:32.541 --> 01:09:34.749
- I am not obsessing.
- Yes you are!

1086
01:09:34.791 --> 01:09:36.499
- I'm not obsessing!

1087
01:09:38.083 --> 01:09:40.708
Look. I don't know what you think
but I think that breaking up

1088
01:09:40.749 --> 01:09:43.083
with Javier left you in a bad shape
and that's fine.

1089
01:09:43.124 --> 01:09:43.958
It is a process...

1090
01:09:43.999 --> 01:09:46.708
I'm not obsessing!
How many times do I have to tell you.

1091
01:09:46.874 --> 01:09:49.041
Don't judge me.

1092
01:09:49.749 --> 01:09:53.166
Don't tell me I'm crazy.
Stay out of it.

1093
01:10:07.208 --> 01:10:09.125
I don't want to talk about it.

1094
01:10:11.333 --> 01:10:13.458
Please don't say anything to them.

1095
01:10:27.416 --> 01:10:28.458
Hey...

1096
01:12:13.916 --> 01:12:16.458
Yes Cristina.
I'll upload that video. but tomorrow.

1097
01:12:17.166 --> 01:12:19.666
Because I am just entering my house
and I'm exhausted.

1098
01:12:21.083 --> 01:12:23.000
Not right now. tomorrow for real.

1099
01:12:25.875 --> 01:12:27.708
Yes. tomorrow.

1100
01:12:29.833 --> 01:12:32.666
There is a little video
for my family Jacques. a birthday video.

1101
01:12:32.708 --> 01:12:33.958
What the fuck!!

1102
01:16:40.375 --> 01:16:41.958
Where am I?
Who are you?

1103
01:16:42.416 --> 01:16:43.666
Don't you recognize me?

1104
01:16:43.833 --> 01:16:44.541
Huh?

1105
01:16:45.041 --> 01:16:46.416
Do you remember me?

1106
01:16:49.083 --> 01:16:50.583
You were the one who won the contest.

1107
01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:53.833
Ah. so you did see me that day.

1108
01:16:58.041 --> 01:16:59.291
Where am I?

1109
01:16:59.750 --> 01:17:03.541
In my house.
you came to give me what you promised me.

1110
01:17:04.333 --> 01:17:05.208
What?

1111
01:17:05.541 --> 01:17:07.541
That I want you to give me
what you promised me

1112
01:17:07.583 --> 01:17:09.000
when I won the contest.

1113
01:17:09.041 --> 01:17:11.416
What did I promise you?
What are you talking about?

1114
01:17:12.291 --> 01:17:15.791
I did not dance. I did not laugh.
that was not a date.

1115
01:17:17.166 --> 01:17:18.458
Are you crazy or what?

1116
01:17:19.166 --> 01:17:21.500
No!
I want what is rightfully mine.

1117
01:17:24.125 --> 01:17:25.250
Let me go.

1118
01:17:27.083 --> 01:17:28.750
Let me go now.

1119
01:17:29.666 --> 01:17:33.666
Let me out of here. you crazy bitch!
Help. help!

1120
01:17:34.666 --> 01:17:36.791
It must not be comfortable. right?

1121
01:17:37.208 --> 01:17:38.875
If you don't calm down.

1122
01:17:38.916 --> 01:17:41.333
You will not be able to get dressed.
If you don't dress up.

1123
01:17:41.375 --> 01:17:42.916
we will not be able to have our date.

1124
01:17:42.958 --> 01:17:45.416
And if we don't have our date.
you will not be able to leave.

1125
01:17:48.208 --> 01:17:49.625
What do you want to hear?

1126
01:17:51.875 --> 01:17:53.916
What kind of music do you like?

1127
01:17:57.583 --> 01:17:58.916
Whatever you want is fine.

1128
01:18:24.375 --> 01:18:25.750
Do you want wine?

1129
01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:27.416
Yes.

1130
01:19:17.375 --> 01:19:18.416
Cheers.

1131
01:19:19.041 --> 01:19:20.916
to a lovely night.

1132
01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:26.166
Aren't you going to toast?

1133
01:19:31.333 --> 01:19:34.416
I know what you are thinking.
why don't I delete her.

1134
01:19:34.666 --> 01:19:38.583
I don't kill her right here.
You can't.

1135
01:19:38.666 --> 01:19:41.291
The key to the padlock
you have on your leg.

1136
01:19:42.041 --> 01:19:43.625
I don't have it with me.

1137
01:19:44.791 --> 01:19:48.125
So. this way if you kill me
you can't get out of here.

1138
01:19:51.875 --> 01:19:52.750
Eat.

1139
01:19:56.333 --> 01:19:57.583
Don't you like it?

1140
01:20:03.458 --> 01:20:05.041
I am Vegetarian.

1141
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.833
I didn't know...
I didn't see that in any of your videos.

1142
01:20:13.291 --> 01:20:15.291
Cristina forbade me tell that.

1143
01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:16.250
Why?

1144
01:20:17.125 --> 01:20:20.333
She says that vegetarians
radiate an air of moral superiority.

1145
01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.375
Smart...

1146
01:20:26.625 --> 01:20:28.750
Tomorrow I will prepare
something that you will like.

1147
01:20:30.166 --> 01:20:31.291
Tomorrow?

1148
01:20:31.708 --> 01:20:33.166
Yes. tomorrow.

1149
01:20:35.208 --> 01:20:37.000
When will I be able to leave here?

1150
01:20:37.583 --> 01:20:38.500
How so?

1151
01:20:38.916 --> 01:20:41.125
When am I going to be able
to get the hell out of here?

1152
01:20:43.041 --> 01:20:45.833
I don't know.
I thought we could stay for a while.

1153
01:20:48.041 --> 01:20:51.500
Don't look at me like that.
you will change your mind.

1154
01:20:58.041 --> 01:21:00.041
So. the book was a success.

1155
01:21:02.333 --> 01:21:03.083
No.

1156
01:21:03.666 --> 01:21:05.625
But you sold 9.000 copies. That's a lot.

1157
01:21:05.666 --> 01:21:06.666
That is a lie.

1158
01:21:08.333 --> 01:21:10.333
It was translated into English.

1159
01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:11.500
Another lie.

1160
01:21:11.541 --> 01:21:14.250
But a lot of people
sent videos to enter the contest.

1161
01:21:14.291 --> 01:21:16.500
A lot of people that we paid to do so

1162
01:21:16.583 --> 01:21:20.541
and to go to the launch.
is called strategy.

1163
01:21:21.166 --> 01:21:22.125
Why?

1164
01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:23.708
Everyone does it.

1165
01:21:23.833 --> 01:21:24.916
Everyone does it.

1166
01:21:25.041 --> 01:21:29.625
Yes...
It is a business that works well.

1167
01:21:30.583 --> 01:21:32.583
So. your business is a lie.

1168
01:21:33.208 --> 01:21:34.208
It is ours.

1169
01:21:34.458 --> 01:21:35.416
What else?

1170
01:21:35.458 --> 01:21:37.166
My relationship with Alexandra.

1171
01:21:38.875 --> 01:21:40.958
nonexistent. never happened.

1172
01:21:43.208 --> 01:21:44.625
I saw them fight.

1173
01:21:45.375 --> 01:21:47.541
You forget that I am an actor.

1174
01:21:50.791 --> 01:21:52.333
You kissed me.

1175
01:21:54.333 --> 01:21:56.083
I am a very good actor.

1176
01:21:57.708 --> 01:21:59.000
And the fight afterwards?

1177
01:21:59.041 --> 01:22:00.041
A script.

1178
01:22:01.416 --> 01:22:03.041
made for actors.

1179
01:22:04.083 --> 01:22:05.500
Everything... Everything is...

1180
01:22:05.541 --> 01:22:06.916
Bullshit. yes.

1181
01:22:07.166 --> 01:22:10.625
A perfectly put show
for obsessive freaks like you.

1182
01:22:10.666 --> 01:22:11.166
No.

1183
01:22:11.416 --> 01:22:13.208
They become obsessed with people like me.

1184
01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:13.875
No.

1185
01:22:13.916 --> 01:22:16.166
For the simple act of standing up
to talk in front of a fucking camera.

1186
01:22:16.208 --> 01:22:17.166
Yes.

1187
01:22:18.250 --> 01:22:19.833
Do you know why we chose you?

1188
01:22:20.875 --> 01:22:23.916
Because we have to put a face
to such a crazy fan.

1189
01:22:23.958 --> 01:22:24.708
- Shut up.

1190
01:22:24.750 --> 01:22:28.458
We really couldn't believe
that there was someone like you.

1191
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:31.125
We had to meet you. we could not believe

1192
01:22:31.166 --> 01:22:33.333
that there was a crazy bitch
of your proportions.

1193
01:22:33.458 --> 01:22:34.416
Shut up!

1194
01:22:49.208 --> 01:22:52.125
What about enjoying your parents' house
while they are on the road?

1195
01:22:52.208 --> 01:22:53.583
Yes. something like that.

1196
01:22:53.916 --> 01:22:56.750
Yes. your dad told me that maybe
you were coming.

1197
01:22:56.791 --> 01:23:00.041
To be on the lookout. I saw your car
and decided to come in and say hello.

1198
01:23:00.166 --> 01:23:01.083
Thank you.

1199
01:23:01.458 --> 01:23:03.875
Well. whatever you need
you can let me know.

1200
01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:05.708
Well. thank you.

1201
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:08.166
Your dad told me
he was going to take out darkroom stuff.

1202
01:23:08.375 --> 01:23:09.875
Yes. I picked them up.

1203
01:23:09.916 --> 01:23:11.458
But...
You left the red light.

1204
01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:13.083
Here are your things.

1205
01:23:13.208 --> 01:23:16.250
Thank you. you're just like your dad.
You want to have everything in order.

1206
01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:20.000
I believe that the minimum
is to change your light bulb.

1207
01:23:20.083 --> 01:23:21.750
No. the truth is that I like it.

1208
01:23:21.791 --> 01:23:23.291
But it is quite uncomfortable.

1209
01:23:23.416 --> 01:23:27.333
I was thinking that...
We could leave the bulb

1210
01:23:27.375 --> 01:23:28.791
and take some pictures.

1211
01:23:31.083 --> 01:23:34.416
Well. if you want us to leave the light
for that. that wouldn't be a problem.

1212
01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:38.000
Yes.

1213
01:23:44.041 --> 01:23:45.916
I hope you like this food.

1214
01:23:49.166 --> 01:23:50.625
Thank you.

1215
01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:58.583
thank you very much. Marcela.

1216
01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.041
to...

1217
01:24:25.583 --> 01:24:26.958
our third attempt.

1218
01:24:29.291 --> 01:24:30.291
Cheers.

1219
01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:31.916
Cheers.

1220
01:24:49.583 --> 01:24:50.583
What?

1221
01:24:54.125 --> 01:24:55.583
I like the song.

1222
01:24:57.166 --> 01:24:58.333
Me too.

1223
01:25:23.125 --> 01:25:24.416
Do you want to dance?

1224
01:28:54.458 --> 01:28:55.541
Who is it?

1225
01:28:56.416 --> 01:28:57.291
Michel.

1226
01:29:05.041 --> 01:29:06.083
- Hello!
- Hello.

1227
01:29:06.125 --> 01:29:07.125
Did I wake you up?

1228
01:29:07.208 --> 01:29:08.500
Ehh. yes.

1229
01:29:08.583 --> 01:29:10.375
I didn't know you slept late.

1230
01:29:10.625 --> 01:29:11.583
What time is it?

1231
01:29:11.666 --> 01:29:13.666
About 10 o'clock in the morning.

1232
01:29:15.250 --> 01:29:16.541
And what are you doing here?

1233
01:29:16.583 --> 01:29:18.333
Well. I was on the market
taking some pictures

1234
01:29:18.375 --> 01:29:20.750
and I saw this and decided
to come to make you breakfast.

1235
01:29:21.875 --> 01:29:23.250
Your family has been very nice to me.

1236
01:29:23.291 --> 01:29:24.666
I want to cook something for you.

1237
01:29:36.375 --> 01:29:38.416
Did you have a party last night or what?

1238
01:29:40.625 --> 01:29:41.500
No.

1239
01:30:02.375 --> 01:30:04.250
I like the way that shirt looks on you.

1240
01:30:07.208 --> 01:30:10.500
I was thinking we could skip the photos.

1241
01:30:13.875 --> 01:30:16.208
No. Michel.
No.

1242
01:32:21.208 --> 01:32:26.208
