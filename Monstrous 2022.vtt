00:00:49.447 --> 00:00:50.916
Cheers.

4
00:01:18.176 --> 00:01:19.645
Cody.

5
00:01:23.448 --> 00:01:24.448
Cody.

6
00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:29.354
Cody.

7
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.507
Cody.

8
00:01:50.976 --> 00:01:52.510
It's time to get up.

9
00:02:14.365 --> 00:02:15.533
You ready. Freddy?

10
00:02:15.634 --> 00:02:17.535
You're silly.

11
00:02:49.367 --> 00:02:51.036
How you doing. buddy?

12
00:02:51.103 --> 00:02:52.370
Where are we?

13
00:02:52.437 --> 00:02:54.339
We're in California.

14
00:02:54.372 --> 00:02:55.708
Keep an eye out
for Mickey Mouse.

15
00:02:55.775 --> 00:02:57.877
We don't want to run him over.

16
00:03:49.494 --> 00:03:51.130
Good afternoon.

17
00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.898
Well. hello there. young lady.

18
00:03:53.833 --> 00:03:55.500
The little one with you?

19
00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:58.103
Yeah. he's buried
in there some place.

20
00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.971
It was long drive.

21
00:03:59.071 --> 00:04:00.239
He's fast asleep.

22
00:04:00.272 --> 00:04:02.608
Let me give you a key
so you can unpack some.

23
00:04:02.641 --> 00:04:03.641
Thank you.

24
00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:05.110
You need any help?

25
00:04:05.144 --> 00:04:06.178
Oh no. thank you.

26
00:04:06.278 --> 00:04:07.345
I don't have much.

27
00:04:07.445 --> 00:04:08.614
Okay.

28
00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:10.091
If you need anything.
just let me know.

29
00:04:10.115 --> 00:04:11.116
You've got the number.

30
00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.085
I do. Mr. Langtree. Thank you.

31
00:04:58.797 --> 00:05:01.066
Oh. what is this place?

32
00:05:02.533 --> 00:05:04.203
It's your new home.

33
00:05:04.303 --> 00:05:05.570
Huh?

34
00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:07.006
Isn't it wonderful?

35
00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:10.709
It's like a dream.

36
00:05:12.378 --> 00:05:13.979
How lucky are we?

37
00:05:21.687 --> 00:05:22.587
Cody.

38
00:05:22.688 --> 00:05:24.489
Look at your room.

39
00:05:24.522 --> 00:05:27.259
Such fun wallpaper. huh?

40
00:05:27.359 --> 00:05:28.761
Oh. and this desk.

41
00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:30.162
it's perfect.

42
00:05:30.195 --> 00:05:32.698
You can do all of your
homework right here.

43
00:05:34.366 --> 00:05:36.702
It's just so great. huh?

44
00:05:36.735 --> 00:05:38.170
Lots of space out there

45
00:05:38.203 --> 00:05:40.505
to play with all of
your new friends.

46
00:05:40.538 --> 00:05:42.841
All right. honey. I'm going
to get some more boxes

47
00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:44.777
in the car and then make dinner.

48
00:05:45.844 --> 00:05:47.379
Are you okay?

49
00:05:47.445 --> 00:05:48.914
I don't feel right.

50
00:05:50.115 --> 00:05:53.584
Well. why don't you
lie down for a little bit

51
00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:55.220
and take a nap.

52
00:07:11.997 --> 00:07:13.298
I thought my own.

53
00:07:13.365 --> 00:07:14.833
Hotpoint dishwasher
was wonderful.

54
00:07:14.933 --> 00:07:17.202
but this new one
is the greatest ever.

55
00:07:17.302 --> 00:07:20.305
It uses a new system
of spotless cleansing.

56
00:07:20.372 --> 00:07:21.473
two detergent washers.

57
00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:24.143
plus a few drops of this
special wetting agent

58
00:07:24.176 --> 00:07:26.845
squirted automatically into
the second rinse water.

59
00:07:26.945 --> 00:07:28.647
And do you know what this does?

60
00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.149
It makes it impossible

61
00:07:30.182 --> 00:07:31.493
for water to collect
in drops like...

62
00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:32.651
Cody.

63
00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:33.795
Why don't you go
play outside. okay?

64
00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:35.821
I'm about to scrub the floor.

65
00:07:35.888 --> 00:07:37.956
Stay near the house
where I can see you.

66
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.957
Sparkling clean

67
00:07:38.991 --> 00:07:40.459
when it's washed in a Hotpoint.

68
00:07:40.492 --> 00:07:42.628
Turn to the classified
pages of your phone book.

69
00:07:42.661 --> 00:07:46.865
That's where you'll find
your nearest Hotpoint dealer

70
00:07:46.965 --> 00:07:49.735
for ranges.

71
00:07:49.835 --> 00:07:52.004
refrigerators.

72
00:07:52.037 --> 00:07:54.840
automatic washers and dryers.

73
00:09:08.747 --> 00:09:09.815
Cody.

74
00:09:12.918 --> 00:09:13.986
Cody?

75
00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:22.828
Cody!

76
00:09:44.917 --> 00:09:46.318
Cody.

77
00:09:52.191 --> 00:09:53.258
Cody!

78
00:09:53.292 --> 00:09:54.860
Didn't you hear me calling you?

79
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.128
What are you doing out here?

80
00:09:56.161 --> 00:09:57.630
I told you to stay
near the house.

81
00:09:57.664 --> 00:09:58.530
Nothing.

82
00:09:58.631 --> 00:09:59.932
I was just...

83
00:10:00.667 --> 00:10:02.100
it's a pond.

84
00:10:04.369 --> 00:10:05.837
I don't you playing near here.

85
00:10:05.938 --> 00:10:07.306
It's dangerous.

86
00:10:24.223 --> 00:10:27.159
I thought my own Hotpoint
dishwasher was wonderful.

87
00:10:27.192 --> 00:10:29.294
but this new one is
the greatest ever.

88
00:10:29.328 --> 00:10:32.497
It uses a new system
of spotless cleansing.

89
00:10:32.564 --> 00:10:33.666
two detergent washes.

90
00:10:33.732 --> 00:10:36.134
plus a few drops of this
special wetting agent.

91
00:10:36.168 --> 00:10:38.671
squirted automatically into
the second rinse water.

92
00:10:38.705 --> 00:10:40.372
And you know what this does?

93
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.483
It makes it impossible for water

94
00:10:42.507 --> 00:10:44.509
to collect in drops
on your dishes.

95
00:10:44.576 --> 00:10:46.178
You get spotless dry.

96
00:10:46.245 --> 00:10:48.347
even on glasses and silver.

97
00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:50.582
Everything is sparkling clean

98
00:10:50.683 --> 00:10:52.084
when it's washed in a Hotpoint.

99
00:10:52.184 --> 00:10:54.586
Turn to the classified
pages of your phone book.

100
00:12:13.999 --> 00:12:17.102
Don't let go. don't let go.

101
00:12:23.575 --> 00:12:24.644
Don't let go.

102
00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:25.977
Don't let go.

103
00:12:42.628 --> 00:12:44.296
Don't be afraid.

104
00:12:46.131 --> 00:12:48.133
You'll be all right.

105
00:12:49.368 --> 00:12:50.535
Greatest ever.

106
00:12:50.636 --> 00:12:52.170
It uses a new
system of spotless...

107
00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:53.505
Mom. mom!

108
00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:55.040
Two detergent washes

109
00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:56.174
plus a few drops of...

110
00:12:56.274 --> 00:12:57.542
Mom!

111
00:12:57.643 --> 00:12:59.044
Mom!

112
00:12:59.144 --> 00:13:00.212
Cody?

113
00:13:01.681 --> 00:13:02.615
What happened?

114
00:13:02.648 --> 00:13:03.949
Mom there's a...

115
00:13:03.982 --> 00:13:04.950
There's a monster
outside my window.

116
00:13:04.983 --> 00:13:06.218
No. honey.

117
00:13:06.318 --> 00:13:07.362
You're just having a bad dream.

118
00:13:07.386 --> 00:13:10.188
No. look. look. look. look!

119
00:13:10.288 --> 00:13:11.390
Okay. okay.

120
00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:12.991
Let's see.

121
00:13:13.058 --> 00:13:15.327
No. no monsters out here.

122
00:13:15.394 --> 00:13:17.062
There was a storm
out there. though.

123
00:13:17.162 --> 00:13:20.332
So maybe that's what
scared you. huh?

124
00:13:22.334 --> 00:13:25.036
I know. I was having
a bad dream too.

125
00:13:26.238 --> 00:13:27.506
Was there a monster in it?

126
00:13:27.539 --> 00:13:30.575
Yes. and it was very scary.

127
00:13:32.077 --> 00:13:34.980
But I know that you and I

128
00:13:35.013 --> 00:13:37.015
are completely safe.

129
00:13:37.048 --> 00:13:39.384
like two bugs. snug in a rug.

130
00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:42.521
Okay?

131
00:13:43.856 --> 00:13:45.157
Get some rest. babe.

132
00:13:45.858 --> 00:13:47.058
You got school tomorrow.

133
00:13:47.159 --> 00:13:48.861
I don't want to go to school.

134
00:13:48.895 --> 00:13:50.562
Well. you have to.

135
00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:52.899
Mommy says.

136
00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:54.867
Come on. lie down.

137
00:13:54.901 --> 00:13:56.201
Lay down.

138
00:13:56.268 --> 00:13:58.336
Get some sleep.

139
00:14:03.442 --> 00:14:04.442
Mom.

140
00:14:05.377 --> 00:14:07.880
can you leave the door open?

141
00:14:07.946 --> 00:14:10.683
Of course.

142
00:14:23.562 --> 00:14:25.698
Dr. Weaver's office.
How may I help you?

143
00:14:25.731 --> 00:14:27.767
May I speak
to Dr. Weaver please?

144
00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:30.202
I'm sorry. ma'am. this is just
his answering service.

145
00:14:30.235 --> 00:14:32.872
Would you like
to leave a message?

146
00:14:32.905 --> 00:14:36.241
No. thank you.

147
00:14:50.088 --> 00:14:51.423
Cody. hurry up.

148
00:14:51.456 --> 00:14:53.759
You don't want to be
late your first day.

149
00:15:08.841 --> 00:15:10.943
Okay. first day of school.

150
00:15:11.009 --> 00:15:12.945
Here's a little tool.

151
00:15:12.979 --> 00:15:15.080
Practice the golden rule

152
00:15:15.113 --> 00:15:17.282
and you will be Mr. Cool.

153
00:15:17.315 --> 00:15:18.951
I love you.

154
00:15:18.985 --> 00:15:21.152
Have a great day. okay?

155
00:16:33.826 --> 00:16:35.260
This is your desk.

156
00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.862
Make yourself comfortable.

157
00:16:38.563 --> 00:16:41.166
I'll go get some materials
and be back and get started.

158
00:16:41.199 --> 00:16:42.868
Okay. thank you.

159
00:16:45.037 --> 00:16:45.871
Hi.

160
00:16:45.938 --> 00:16:47.205
Hi.

161
00:16:47.238 --> 00:16:48.239
I'm Laura.

162
00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.541
Jane.

163
00:16:49.574 --> 00:16:51.276
It's very nice
to meet you. Jane.

164
00:16:51.376 --> 00:16:53.111
Where'd you get that dress?

165
00:16:53.211 --> 00:16:54.412
Oh. this?

166
00:16:54.512 --> 00:16:56.348
I...

167
00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:58.416
This is Jane.

168
00:16:59.284 --> 00:17:01.252
Yes. sir. Right away.

169
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.078
Hey. how was your first day?

170
00:17:26.144 --> 00:17:28.080
It was okay.

171
00:17:28.114 --> 00:17:29.782
Did you make any new friends?

172
00:17:31.751 --> 00:17:32.718
No.

173
00:17:32.752 --> 00:17:35.755
Well. I'm sure
you will in no time.

174
00:17:37.155 --> 00:17:39.224
All right. here we go home.

175
00:17:57.575 --> 00:18:00.680
Well. I had a great
first day at work.

176
00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.115
The ladies. they're so nice.

177
00:18:03.149 --> 00:18:06.184
Kathy and. um...

178
00:18:06.284 --> 00:18:07.687
Susan.

179
00:18:07.787 --> 00:18:10.790
Well. I just got such
a tickle out of all of them.

180
00:18:12.158 --> 00:18:13.693
Cody. eat your dinner.

181
00:18:14.927 --> 00:18:16.128
I'm not hungry.

182
00:18:16.194 --> 00:18:18.196
Well. try to eat a little.

183
00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.383
The troll was twice as big as
the biggest Billy goat gruff.

184
00:18:38.483 --> 00:18:40.385
but the Billy goat
was not afraid.

185
00:18:40.485 --> 00:18:43.622
He lowered his horns
and ran at the troll.

186
00:18:43.656 --> 00:18:46.158
pushing him over the bridge.

187
00:18:46.192 --> 00:18:48.127
The troll screamed with fury

188
00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.829
as he fell into the water

189
00:18:49.862 --> 00:18:52.031
and was swept away
by the current.

190
00:18:52.998 --> 00:18:55.467
Then. the biggest
Billy goat gruff

191
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.335
joined his family in the Meadow

192
00:18:57.368 --> 00:18:59.370
and told them they
never to worry

193
00:18:59.471 --> 00:19:01.707
about crossing the bridge again.

194
00:19:01.807 --> 00:19:02.842
The end.

195
00:19:02.908 --> 00:19:04.844
Read another one.

196
00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:06.011
Sorry.

197
00:19:06.045 --> 00:19:07.378
The time has come

198
00:19:07.479 --> 00:19:10.049
for counting sheep for little
boys who need their sleep.

199
00:19:12.584 --> 00:19:13.584
Now lie down.

200
00:19:13.652 --> 00:19:15.187
You've got school tomorrow.

201
00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:17.388
Got to get some rest.

202
00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:19.692
Goodnight. sweet prince.

203
00:19:26.866 --> 00:19:29.201
Leave the door open. okay?

204
00:19:29.235 --> 00:19:30.903
Okay.

205
00:19:31.003 --> 00:19:32.171
Love you.

206
00:19:32.204 --> 00:19:33.239
Hello. Betty?

207
00:19:33.338 --> 00:19:34.506
Betty Ferguson?

208
00:19:34.539 --> 00:19:35.608
Yes. who's this?

209
00:19:35.708 --> 00:19:36.675
This is Rick Nelson.

210
00:19:36.709 --> 00:19:37.843
Oh. David's brother?

211
00:19:37.877 --> 00:19:39.377
Yeah.

212
00:19:40.578 --> 00:19:41.881
Say. what time do you want me

213
00:19:41.947 --> 00:19:43.524
to pick you up for
the dance Friday night?

214
00:19:43.548 --> 00:19:44.726
Oh. well. 8:30
would just be wonderful.

215
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.252
Hey. I found her.

216
00:19:46.351 --> 00:19:48.486
Okay. I'll be there at 8:30...

217
00:19:48.586 --> 00:19:51.056
- Hello?
- Laura?

218
00:19:52.357 --> 00:19:53.759
I thought my own.

219
00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:55.460
Hotpoint dishwasher
was wonderful.

220
00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.897
but this new one is
the greatest ever...

221
00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:01.233
It uses a new system
of spotless cleansing.

222
00:20:01.267 --> 00:20:02.902
two detergent washes

223
00:20:02.935 --> 00:20:06.238
and a few drops of this
special wetting agent

224
00:20:06.304 --> 00:20:07.907
squirted automatically.

225
00:21:01.927 --> 00:21:03.028
Hello?

226
00:21:03.128 --> 00:21:03.996
Laura.

227
00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:05.197
Mother.

228
00:21:05.297 --> 00:21:06.675
Mother. how could you
give Scott my number?

229
00:21:06.699 --> 00:21:07.833
Cody.

230
00:21:07.933 --> 00:21:09.010
Laura. where have you been?

231
00:21:09.034 --> 00:21:10.468
He just called here.

232
00:21:10.501 --> 00:21:12.171
How could you do that?

233
00:21:12.271 --> 00:21:13.639
I didn't give him your number.

234
00:21:13.706 --> 00:21:15.250
I only gave it
to a few of your friends.

235
00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:16.308
Why?

236
00:21:16.374 --> 00:21:17.542
Why would you do that?

237
00:21:17.643 --> 00:21:20.045
I told you
not to give it to anyone.

238
00:21:20.145 --> 00:21:21.379
They're your friends.

239
00:21:21.479 --> 00:21:23.115
Did you give him my address too?

240
00:21:23.148 --> 00:21:24.316
Is he gonna come here?

241
00:21:24.382 --> 00:21:25.760
He's not going
to come there. Laura.

242
00:21:25.784 --> 00:21:27.452
He just wants to talk to you.

243
00:21:27.485 --> 00:21:28.687
He feels so bad.

244
00:21:28.721 --> 00:21:31.023
I don't care how he feels.

245
00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:33.659
I don't know how you
can even speak to him

246
00:21:33.692 --> 00:21:34.860
after what he did.

247
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:38.163
You're supposed
to be on our side.

248
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:39.999
Grandma would be.

249
00:21:40.032 --> 00:21:42.234
Of course
we're on your side. Laura.

250
00:21:42.334 --> 00:21:43.636
No you're not.

251
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:44.469
Honey. why don't
I come and stay with you

252
00:21:44.502 --> 00:21:45.838
for a while?

253
00:21:45.905 --> 00:21:47.840
No. No.

254
00:21:47.907 --> 00:21:49.708
I don't need any help.
Everything's perfect.

255
00:22:11.196 --> 00:22:13.198
Mom!

256
00:22:13.265 --> 00:22:13.866
Cody.

257
00:22:13.933 --> 00:22:15.100
Cody. what's wrong?

258
00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.440
There was a monster in my room.

259
00:22:16.534 --> 00:22:18.370
It's okay. It's okay.

260
00:22:18.436 --> 00:22:19.939
You're okay.

261
00:22:20.039 --> 00:22:21.683
Mom. the monster
from the pond was in my room!

262
00:22:21.707 --> 00:22:23.676
Honey. there's no monster.

263
00:22:23.709 --> 00:22:25.077
You're just having a bad dream.

264
00:22:25.177 --> 00:22:26.254
You're not listening to me.

265
00:22:26.278 --> 00:22:27.713
It was right here.

266
00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:28.924
It doesn't feel like a dream.

267
00:22:28.948 --> 00:22:31.383
I know. but it was. I promise.

268
00:22:31.417 --> 00:22:32.751
The monster was here.

269
00:23:53.632 --> 00:23:56.502
As I yearn to return to you.

270
00:23:56.602 --> 00:23:59.805
so will you yearn
to return to me.

271
00:24:01.173 --> 00:24:03.375
When our paths do cross again.

272
00:24:03.475 --> 00:24:05.878
our hearts will
entwined with ecstasy.

273
00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:13.819
Laura.

274
00:24:13.852 --> 00:24:16.288
I thought you were
Mrs. Seton's ghost.

275
00:24:16.321 --> 00:24:17.723
No. Grandma.

276
00:24:17.823 --> 00:24:19.324
She doesn't like
it in the attic.

277
00:24:19.358 --> 00:24:21.527
I only ever see her
in the basement.

278
00:24:21.627 --> 00:24:23.328
Me too.

279
00:24:23.362 --> 00:24:26.031
Where did you find
this old thing?

280
00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:31.336
Ugh. Is he really
worth the effort?

281
00:24:32.704 --> 00:24:35.174
Oh. honey. don't cry.

282
00:24:35.207 --> 00:24:38.911
I can't even imagine how hard
it is to be young these days.

283
00:24:39.011 --> 00:24:41.180
It was so much simpler
back in my time.

284
00:24:41.213 --> 00:24:43.749
I wish I could take
you back there with me.

285
00:24:44.683 --> 00:24:45.984
I wish I could too.

286
00:24:46.819 --> 00:24:48.087
You'd fit right in.

287
00:24:49.688 --> 00:24:51.356
Thanks. Grandma.

288
00:25:14.379 --> 00:25:15.881
This is Dr. Weaver's office.

289
00:25:15.948 --> 00:25:17.382
How may I help you?

290
00:25:17.416 --> 00:25:18.851
Hi. Francine?

291
00:25:18.884 --> 00:25:19.785
It's Laura Butler.

292
00:25:19.885 --> 00:25:20.786
Hi. Laura.

293
00:25:20.886 --> 00:25:22.126
We've been trying to reach you.

294
00:25:22.221 --> 00:25:24.223
Oh. Dr. Weaver just
walked in. hold on.

295
00:25:24.289 --> 00:25:26.692
Laura. how are you?

296
00:25:26.725 --> 00:25:28.227
Hi. Doctor.

297
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:32.598
I don't know.

298
00:25:32.698 --> 00:25:34.066
What's going on?

299
00:25:35.901 --> 00:25:37.069
Scott called.

300
00:25:38.036 --> 00:25:39.316
Are you having the dreams again?

301
00:25:39.404 --> 00:25:40.607
Yeah.

302
00:25:40.706 --> 00:25:44.810
I'm wondering if maybe I
should go back on medication.

303
00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:46.578
You know. I prefer we didn't

304
00:25:46.645 --> 00:25:48.413
handle them through medication.

305
00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.815
Can you come in today?

306
00:25:49.915 --> 00:25:51.950
No. I'm out of town.

307
00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:53.485
Where are you?

308
00:25:54.386 --> 00:25:55.420
Laura?

309
00:25:56.755 --> 00:25:57.990
I'm here.

310
00:25:58.090 --> 00:25:59.591
Where are you?

311
00:26:01.393 --> 00:26:04.963
You know. I think
I'm just being silly.

312
00:26:05.063 --> 00:26:07.332
Everything will be fine.

313
00:26:07.432 --> 00:26:10.002
- Thank you. Doctor.
- Laura?

314
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:13.606
Cody. hurry up.

315
00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.973
We're going to be late.

316
00:26:21.113 --> 00:26:23.448
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

317
00:26:24.483 --> 00:26:26.118
What can I do for you?

318
00:26:26.151 --> 00:26:27.795
Well. I just wanted to
let you know that the.

319
00:26:27.819 --> 00:26:29.988
the kitchen sink was leaking.

320
00:26:30.088 --> 00:26:31.857
So I turned off the water.

321
00:26:31.957 --> 00:26:34.927
Probably just need
your new seed washer.

322
00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.596
I'll come by and take a look.

323
00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:38.864
Thank you.

324
00:26:38.964 --> 00:26:43.335
And also the television
sort of popped

325
00:26:44.536 --> 00:26:46.004
and now it's not working.

326
00:26:46.104 --> 00:26:48.140
We're not responsible
for the television.

327
00:26:48.207 --> 00:26:50.976
Well. now. Lenora. I'd go
by and take a look at it.

328
00:26:51.009 --> 00:26:53.812
Well. but she's going to
have to pay for the parts

329
00:26:53.845 --> 00:26:55.615
and the television
was left behind.

330
00:26:55.648 --> 00:26:56.815
It's not part of the house.

331
00:26:56.882 --> 00:26:58.150
That's okay.

332
00:26:58.217 --> 00:27:00.687
If you wouldn't mind
just taking a look.

333
00:27:00.786 --> 00:27:01.820
Will do.

334
00:27:01.853 --> 00:27:03.021
Okay.

335
00:27:03.088 --> 00:27:04.223
Well. have a nice day.

336
00:27:04.323 --> 00:27:06.191
You as well. young lady.

337
00:27:09.662 --> 00:27:10.996
That's how it starts.

338
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:13.999
I thought
my own Hotpoint dishwasher

339
00:27:14.066 --> 00:27:15.334
was wonderful.

340
00:27:15.367 --> 00:27:17.502
but this new one is
the greatest ever.

341
00:27:17.536 --> 00:27:20.005
It uses a new system
of spotless cleanser.

342
00:27:20.072 --> 00:27:21.674
two detergent washes.

343
00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.343
plus a few drops of this
special wetting agent

344
00:27:24.376 --> 00:27:26.713
squirted automatically in
the second rinse water.

345
00:27:26.812 --> 00:27:28.213
And do you know what this does?

346
00:27:28.313 --> 00:27:31.583
It makes it impossible for
water to collect in drops

347
00:27:31.684 --> 00:27:32.719
on your dishes.

348
00:27:32.818 --> 00:27:34.253
You get spotless dry.

349
00:27:34.353 --> 00:27:36.388
even on glasses and silver.

350
00:27:36.421 --> 00:27:38.357
Everything is sparkling clean

351
00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:40.525
when it's washed in a Hotpoint.

352
00:27:46.598 --> 00:27:48.033
Cody.

353
00:28:03.683 --> 00:28:06.218
Turn to the classified
pages of your phone book.

354
00:28:06.251 --> 00:28:07.853
That's where you will find

355
00:28:07.886 --> 00:28:10.355
your nearest Hotpoint dealer.

356
00:28:43.121 --> 00:28:44.289
Refrigerators.

357
00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:46.458
automatic washers and...

358
00:31:42.935 --> 00:31:43.935
Cody!

359
00:32:17.035 --> 00:32:20.205
Cody!

360
00:32:23.341 --> 00:32:25.377
I want to go home.

361
00:32:33.619 --> 00:32:34.319
Amber.

362
00:32:34.386 --> 00:32:35.821
Is this you?

363
00:32:35.888 --> 00:32:36.888
You did this?

364
00:32:36.956 --> 00:32:38.223
Are you sure?

365
00:32:50.368 --> 00:32:51.570
So I thought maybe you

366
00:32:51.671 --> 00:32:53.071
had come by the
house for something.

367
00:32:53.171 --> 00:32:55.073
No. no. probably a raccoon.

368
00:32:55.173 --> 00:32:57.175
They climb all over the place.

369
00:32:57.242 --> 00:32:59.311
Bunch of pests.

370
00:32:59.344 --> 00:33:01.881
No. I don't think
this was a raccoon.

371
00:33:01.981 --> 00:33:05.216
My son said that he saw
something down by the pond.

372
00:33:05.317 --> 00:33:06.719
He's not supposed
to be at the pond.

373
00:33:06.819 --> 00:33:08.219
I don't want him
playing near there.

374
00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.922
Yes. I know. I have. uh.

375
00:33:10.022 --> 00:33:11.724
I've already told him
to stay away from it.

376
00:33:11.824 --> 00:33:13.358
I can set some traps
from the raccoons.

377
00:33:13.425 --> 00:33:16.862
Again. I really don't
think it was a raccoon.

378
00:33:16.896 --> 00:33:19.431
So I don't think that
that would be helpful.

379
00:33:19.531 --> 00:33:23.769
Oh. but I did manage
to lock myself out

380
00:33:23.869 --> 00:33:26.204
of the house last night when
I went to investigate and...

381
00:33:26.271 --> 00:33:27.707
Wait. that's impossible.

382
00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:29.407
The door doesn't
lock on its own...

383
00:33:29.507 --> 00:33:30.719
Well. then I guess it was stuck.

384
00:33:30.743 --> 00:33:32.078
- Well you need...
- Anyway.

385
00:33:32.177 --> 00:33:35.047
I had to break the window
on the door to get in.

386
00:33:35.113 --> 00:33:37.016
So I'm so sorry.

387
00:33:37.049 --> 00:33:38.089
We already fixed the sink.

388
00:33:38.116 --> 00:33:39.360
We're not paying
for that window.

389
00:33:39.384 --> 00:33:40.518
You broke it.

390
00:33:40.552 --> 00:33:43.555
Of course I will
pay for the window.

391
00:33:43.588 --> 00:33:45.691
Anytime you can stop by.

392
00:33:45.725 --> 00:33:46.926
Don't you worry.

393
00:33:47.026 --> 00:33:48.026
I'll take care of it.

394
00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:49.294
Thank you.

395
00:33:55.968 --> 00:33:57.302
Hey. how was your day?

396
00:34:05.778 --> 00:34:07.880
You're not still
mad at me. are you?

397
00:34:09.715 --> 00:34:12.051
Honey. I said I was sorry.

398
00:34:15.387 --> 00:34:16.922
How about some ice cream?

399
00:34:16.956 --> 00:34:18.090
Huh?

400
00:34:18.124 --> 00:34:19.091
Yeah.

401
00:34:19.125 --> 00:34:22.061
Cody. why don't you go play?

402
00:34:22.094 --> 00:34:22.928
This looks fun.

403
00:34:22.995 --> 00:34:23.763
Kickball.

404
00:34:23.796 --> 00:34:25.163
Why don't you go play with them?

405
00:34:25.263 --> 00:34:26.766
They're friends.

406
00:34:26.799 --> 00:34:29.167
Well. this kid's all by himself.

407
00:34:29.267 --> 00:34:30.646
He looks like he
could use a friend.

408
00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:32.104
Why don't you go
ask him to play?

409
00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:33.606
He's a dipstick.

410
00:34:33.673 --> 00:34:37.308
Well. maybe you could
help him be a better person.

411
00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:38.476
Right?

412
00:34:39.444 --> 00:34:41.113
Go on. Go ask him to play.

413
00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:42.247
I'll hold your ice cream.

414
00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.314
I don't want to.

415
00:34:43.415 --> 00:34:44.817
Go on. ask him to play.

416
00:35:00.933 --> 00:35:01.967
Let's go.

417
00:35:02.001 --> 00:35:03.602
What happened?
He didn't want to play?

418
00:35:03.636 --> 00:35:04.770
No. I told you. let's go.

419
00:35:04.804 --> 00:35:06.172
Cody. did he say
something to you?

420
00:35:06.271 --> 00:35:07.707
No. God. forget it. okay?

421
00:35:07.807 --> 00:35:09.108
Cody.

422
00:35:36.168 --> 00:35:38.003
Cody. I know you're
not happy here.

423
00:35:38.037 --> 00:35:42.174
We are not going back to
Mesa and you know why.

424
00:35:42.208 --> 00:35:44.677
Because you hate Dad.

425
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:46.411
No. I don't hate Dad.

426
00:35:46.511 --> 00:35:47.813
I hate what Dad did to us.

427
00:35:47.847 --> 00:35:50.082
And I'm going to make very sure

428
00:35:50.182 --> 00:35:51.549
that he can never hurt us again.

429
00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:54.586
Well. I forgive him.

430
00:35:59.357 --> 00:36:01.694
I'm so proud of you for that.

431
00:36:04.429 --> 00:36:06.098
But I'm not ready.

432
00:36:08.234 --> 00:36:09.835
Maybe someday.

433
00:36:11.402 --> 00:36:13.038
In the meantime.

434
00:36:13.072 --> 00:36:17.009
can we try to be
happy living here?

435
00:36:18.543 --> 00:36:20.512
Please?

436
00:36:24.083 --> 00:36:26.051
What you drawing?

437
00:36:26.085 --> 00:36:28.053
The pretty lady.

438
00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:29.622
What pretty lady?

439
00:36:29.722 --> 00:36:31.056
From the pond.

440
00:36:31.857 --> 00:36:34.026
I thought you said it
was a monster in the pond.

441
00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:36.862
I thought there was
a monster in the pond.

442
00:36:36.896 --> 00:36:41.066
but then she came to my
room and talked to me.

443
00:36:42.968 --> 00:36:44.770
Now I understand.

444
00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.743
Understand what?

445
00:36:53.378 --> 00:36:54.479
Come meet her. Mom.

446
00:36:54.579 --> 00:36:57.249
Come talk to her.

447
00:36:57.283 --> 00:36:58.918
Let's go to the pond.

448
00:36:58.951 --> 00:37:01.586
I don't wanna go to the pond.

449
00:37:02.655 --> 00:37:05.057
Well. then I guess she'll
just have to come to you.

450
00:37:05.724 --> 00:37:07.392
You know what I would love?

451
00:37:07.425 --> 00:37:08.828
I would love it

452
00:37:08.928 --> 00:37:11.764
if you would draw me
a picture of your school or.

453
00:37:11.797 --> 00:37:13.165
or what about a bird?

454
00:37:13.265 --> 00:37:15.768
And we can put your
drawings up on the fridge.

455
00:37:17.236 --> 00:37:19.004
It'll look so nice.

456
00:39:50.322 --> 00:39:52.391
Did you see the pretty lady?

457
00:39:52.424 --> 00:39:54.293
Did she talk to you. Mom?

458
00:39:54.393 --> 00:39:56.061
Cody. go to sleep.

459
00:39:57.763 --> 00:39:59.264
I love you. Mom.

460
00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:19.985
Cody.

461
00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:22.955
Cody.

462
00:40:22.988 --> 00:40:24.356
I said lunch was ready.

463
00:40:24.456 --> 00:40:26.125
Okay.

464
00:40:29.495 --> 00:40:31.130
That's enough.

465
00:40:31.196 --> 00:40:32.597
Give it back!

466
00:40:36.502 --> 00:40:38.137
Cody Richard Butler.

467
00:40:38.203 --> 00:40:41.173
Don't you ever do that again.

468
00:40:43.142 --> 00:40:44.676
Cody.

469
00:40:44.777 --> 00:40:46.445
Why are you so angry at me?

470
00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:49.214
I can't tell you.

471
00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:53.551
Is it about your birthday?

472
00:40:53.652 --> 00:40:55.287
I didn't forget.

473
00:40:56.321 --> 00:40:57.389
My birthday?

474
00:40:58.357 --> 00:41:01.026
I was going to ask you
what you wanted to do.

475
00:41:04.496 --> 00:41:06.331
Anything but that.

476
00:41:11.336 --> 00:41:12.838
Hey. I was thinking.

477
00:41:12.905 --> 00:41:14.406
how about we have a party?

478
00:41:15.474 --> 00:41:16.475
We can.

479
00:41:16.508 --> 00:41:18.077
we can have balloons

480
00:41:18.177 --> 00:41:20.646
and ice cream and
cake and presents.

481
00:41:20.679 --> 00:41:23.749
and we can invite
your entire class.

482
00:41:25.017 --> 00:41:28.220
It'll be a gas. right?

483
00:41:32.491 --> 00:41:34.159
Okay.

484
00:41:35.861 --> 00:41:37.595
Okay.

485
00:41:38.497 --> 00:41:40.666
I don't
mind. though. Keeps him happy.

486
00:41:40.699 --> 00:41:44.670
I'm sure our Hotpoint
refrigerator doesn't mind either...

487
00:41:44.703 --> 00:41:47.539
Hey. he looks just
like Roy Rogers.

488
00:41:47.606 --> 00:41:49.408
You like Roy Rogers. right?

489
00:41:50.175 --> 00:41:51.510
I have
a feeling it'll be with us

490
00:41:51.543 --> 00:41:53.879
long after Dave and Ricky
are grown up and married.

491
00:41:53.912 --> 00:41:56.381
And I love the way our
Hotpoint's designed too.

492
00:41:56.448 --> 00:41:58.450
It could've been...

493
00:42:00.219 --> 00:42:02.588
All the interior arrangements
are so practical.

494
00:42:14.466 --> 00:42:16.368
Why don't you talk to
your Hotpoint dealer today

495
00:42:16.401 --> 00:42:19.238
about a refrigerator like
this for your family?

496
00:42:19.271 --> 00:42:22.474
Turn to the classified
pages of your phone book.

497
00:42:22.574 --> 00:42:26.445
That's where you will find
your nearest Hotpoint dealer.

498
00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:35.087
There.

499
00:42:36.288 --> 00:42:38.957
Now there are exactly
enough invitations

500
00:42:39.057 --> 00:42:40.592
for every kid in your class.

501
00:42:40.627 --> 00:42:43.562
So I want you to make sure
that everyone gets one. okay?

502
00:42:43.595 --> 00:42:44.963
They won't come.

503
00:42:45.063 --> 00:42:46.633
Of course they will.

504
00:42:46.732 --> 00:42:48.500
Everyone loves a party.

505
00:42:48.601 --> 00:42:51.236
- Can I invite the pretty lady?
- Who?

506
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:52.838
The pretty lady from the pond.

507
00:42:52.938 --> 00:42:56.275
No. No. you can't.

508
00:42:57.276 --> 00:42:59.745
Why not? She's my best friend.

509
00:42:59.778 --> 00:43:01.747
She said that she
would take me home.

510
00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:04.316
Cody.

511
00:43:04.416 --> 00:43:06.418
This is your home.

512
00:43:06.451 --> 00:43:07.753
Okay?

513
00:43:07.786 --> 00:43:09.788
If you would just
talk to her. Mom.

514
00:43:09.821 --> 00:43:11.156
Cody. that's enough.

515
00:43:11.223 --> 00:43:13.458
Clean up your toys.
It's almost bedtime.

516
00:43:36.882 --> 00:43:39.451
Here she comes.

517
00:43:44.223 --> 00:43:45.692
Cody.

518
00:43:46.358 --> 00:43:47.826
Go upstairs.
hide in your closet.

519
00:43:47.859 --> 00:43:49.127
Do not make a sound.

520
00:43:49.161 --> 00:43:50.462
No. it's okay. Mom. It's okay.

521
00:43:50.495 --> 00:43:52.497
- Listen to me. Don't be afraid!
- Cody. just go.

522
00:44:52.891 --> 00:44:55.728
Cody. are you okay?

523
00:45:43.676 --> 00:45:46.278
Mom. Mom.

524
00:45:47.747 --> 00:45:50.282
Mom. Mom.

525
00:45:51.684 --> 00:45:53.085
You fell down.

526
00:45:56.789 --> 00:45:58.758
Come on. Come on.

527
00:46:02.494 --> 00:46:05.197
- Mom. what are you doing?
- Get in the car.

528
00:46:05.297 --> 00:46:07.366
- Why?
- Just get in.

529
00:46:07.466 --> 00:46:10.469
- But. Mom...
- Get in the car!

530
00:46:13.138 --> 00:46:14.973
- Where are we going?
- Anywhere but here.

531
00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:16.341
But why? Because she scared you?

532
00:46:16.441 --> 00:46:17.777
She didn't mean
to scare you. Mom.

533
00:46:17.810 --> 00:46:18.845
Be quiet. Cody!

534
00:46:18.944 --> 00:46:20.278
You need to talk to her. Mom.

535
00:46:20.312 --> 00:46:21.422
She would never hurt you.
She wouldn't hurt anyone!

536
00:46:21.446 --> 00:46:23.014
Enough. Cody! Enough!

537
00:46:23.115 --> 00:46:24.483
I don't not know
what that thing is

538
00:46:24.516 --> 00:46:26.151
but you are never
talking to it again.

539
00:46:26.184 --> 00:46:27.486
Do you understand? Ever!

540
00:46:27.519 --> 00:46:28.788
Are you gonna take me home?

541
00:46:28.821 --> 00:46:31.189
No. goddammit.
for the hundredth time.

542
00:46:31.289 --> 00:46:32.825
We're not going home.

543
00:46:32.891 --> 00:46:34.226
Stop talking about that.

544
00:46:34.326 --> 00:46:35.994
Then where are we going?

545
00:46:42.134 --> 00:46:43.669
What am I supposed to do?

546
00:46:48.407 --> 00:46:51.510
What am I supposed to do?

547
00:46:56.148 --> 00:46:57.750
It's okay. Mom.

548
00:46:58.651 --> 00:46:59.652
She's gone.

549
00:47:01.319 --> 00:47:03.522
I'll tell her not
to bother you anymore.

550
00:47:05.157 --> 00:47:06.358
Okay?

551
00:47:06.391 --> 00:47:08.393
You should go to bed.
You're tired.

552
00:47:09.261 --> 00:47:12.899
I'll stay with you. okay?

553
00:47:12.998 --> 00:47:15.434
We'll be all right.

554
00:47:15.534 --> 00:47:17.770
I promise.

555
00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:19.237
We're gonna be all right.

556
00:47:50.569 --> 00:47:52.471
You ready?

557
00:47:54.272 --> 00:47:56.575
Now. I want you
to give these out

558
00:47:56.609 --> 00:47:58.744
as soon as you get
to school. okay?

559
00:47:58.778 --> 00:48:00.145
- Okay.
- Okay.

560
00:48:00.245 --> 00:48:02.782
Put 'em right in here.

561
00:48:18.096 --> 00:48:19.598
Hello. operator.

562
00:48:19.665 --> 00:48:23.568
will you connect me with
St. Mary's church please?

563
00:48:24.336 --> 00:48:25.170
Thank you.

564
00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:26.271
Saint Mary's.

565
00:48:26.304 --> 00:48:27.773
Sister Agnes speaking.

566
00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:29.007
Hi.

567
00:48:29.107 --> 00:48:31.777
I was wondering if there
might be someone available

568
00:48:31.844 --> 00:48:34.647
to speak with me?

569
00:48:34.747 --> 00:48:36.448
I. I think...

570
00:48:37.082 --> 00:48:41.787
I think I have a demon
or something in my house.

571
00:48:44.824 --> 00:48:47.627
Hello?

572
00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:49.528
Hello?

573
00:49:15.554 --> 00:49:16.989
Is Mr. Langtree available?

574
00:49:17.023 --> 00:49:20.026
Why. what'd you break this time?

575
00:49:20.125 --> 00:49:21.827
Oh. Nothing. nothing.

576
00:49:21.894 --> 00:49:23.663
I just. um...

577
00:49:25.698 --> 00:49:27.733
I don't. I don't know
exactly how to say this.

578
00:49:27.833 --> 00:49:29.702
Well. just say it.

579
00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:33.505
Has anyone ever said

580
00:49:33.538 --> 00:49:37.677
that there's something
wrong with the house?

581
00:49:38.577 --> 00:49:40.980
What are you up to. missy?

582
00:49:42.014 --> 00:49:43.381
What do you mean?

583
00:49:43.481 --> 00:49:45.192
Because you knew exactly
what you were getting into

584
00:49:45.216 --> 00:49:46.585
when you moved into the house.

585
00:49:46.686 --> 00:49:49.021
So if you think that you
can come sashaying in here

586
00:49:49.087 --> 00:49:50.756
in that little skirt

587
00:49:50.856 --> 00:49:53.693
and con us into putting a whole
bunch of money into that place.

588
00:49:53.726 --> 00:49:55.861
my husband might be stupid
enough to fall for that.

589
00:49:55.895 --> 00:49:56.929
but I'm not.

590
00:49:57.029 --> 00:49:58.764
I'm not trying to do anything.

591
00:49:58.864 --> 00:50:00.464
Well. I don't know
what you're doing here

592
00:50:00.532 --> 00:50:02.534
in the first place. unless
you're hiding something.

593
00:50:02.567 --> 00:50:04.870
I am trying to ask you...

594
00:50:06.371 --> 00:50:09.240
if there's a ghost in the house.

595
00:50:09.341 --> 00:50:11.010
A ghost!

596
00:50:11.043 --> 00:50:12.210
Is it drugs?

597
00:50:12.277 --> 00:50:14.179
No. no.

598
00:50:14.212 --> 00:50:15.881
I have a child.

599
00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:24.456
Because if I get wind

600
00:50:24.556 --> 00:50:26.591
that any of that crap
is going on in that house.

601
00:50:26.692 --> 00:50:28.560
I'm going to call the police.

602
00:50:28.628 --> 00:50:30.730
and you can be sure of the fact

603
00:50:30.763 --> 00:50:32.898
they'll take your
child away from you.

604
00:50:51.383 --> 00:50:52.393
What are we going to do
with all these balloons?

605
00:50:52.417 --> 00:50:53.385
Oh. we're going to hang them.

606
00:50:53.418 --> 00:50:55.453
I'm going to hang from here.

607
00:50:55.553 --> 00:50:58.057
and then along there.

608
00:50:58.090 --> 00:50:59.357
And maybe over there.

609
00:50:59.457 --> 00:51:00.626
It's gonna look great.

610
00:51:00.726 --> 00:51:02.061
Everyone's gonna love it.

611
00:51:06.431 --> 00:51:08.233
It sounds like I farted.

612
00:51:08.266 --> 00:51:09.602
You do it. Mom.

613
00:51:16.142 --> 00:51:17.342
Who cut the cheese?

614
00:52:16.334 --> 00:52:18.037
Perfect.

615
00:52:35.087 --> 00:52:36.588
Don't worry. I'm
sure they're coming.

616
00:52:36.689 --> 00:52:39.024
You know. I bet some
of them even got lost.

617
00:52:39.058 --> 00:52:42.260
And people love to
come late to parties.

618
00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:43.428
You'll see.

619
00:52:46.098 --> 00:52:47.900
Maybe I should give
a few of them a call.

620
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.535
I think I have a class list
from the school in the kitchen.

621
00:52:50.568 --> 00:52:51.937
Be right back.

622
00:53:18.931 --> 00:53:20.766
I don't think they're
coming. buddy.

623
00:53:22.201 --> 00:53:24.069
I know.

624
00:53:24.136 --> 00:53:27.239
I don't want you to
take it personally. okay?

625
00:53:27.273 --> 00:53:29.041
We live really far out of town.

626
00:53:29.074 --> 00:53:30.910
You know. some
people. they just.

627
00:53:30.976 --> 00:53:35.446
they can't spend the
time driving out here.

628
00:53:36.148 --> 00:53:38.083
Okay?

629
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:40.418
But hey. next year
we'll have your party

630
00:53:40.451 --> 00:53:42.955
at the malt shop
or the pizza parlor.

631
00:53:43.055 --> 00:53:45.157
That'll be fun.

632
00:53:45.257 --> 00:53:47.092
Okay.

633
00:53:47.126 --> 00:53:50.629
Do you wanna open your presents?

634
00:53:50.729 --> 00:53:52.131
Not right now.

635
00:53:52.231 --> 00:53:54.399
I think I'm just
going to go upstairs.

636
00:53:54.432 --> 00:53:56.068
You sure?

637
00:53:56.101 --> 00:53:58.103
Okay.

638
00:54:11.851 --> 00:54:13.285
Stop calling here. Scott.

639
00:54:13.351 --> 00:54:15.287
Please don't
hang up on me. Laura.

640
00:54:15.353 --> 00:54:18.090
Please talk to me.

641
00:54:19.124 --> 00:54:21.459
I've said everything I
ever want to say to you.

642
00:54:21.526 --> 00:54:23.996
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

643
00:54:24.096 --> 00:54:26.431
I miss you. I miss my son.

644
00:54:26.464 --> 00:54:27.867
Well. you better get used to it

645
00:54:27.967 --> 00:54:30.202
because you'll never see
either one of us ever again.

646
00:55:09.675 --> 00:55:12.845
And I love the way our
Hotpoint's designed too.

647
00:55:12.912 --> 00:55:14.747
It could have been made for me.

648
00:55:15.681 --> 00:55:18.984
The interior arrangements
are all so practical.

649
00:56:22.314 --> 00:56:24.049
Cody!

650
00:56:24.083 --> 00:56:24.984
Why?

651
00:56:25.084 --> 00:56:26.551
Why didn't you hand these out?

652
00:56:26.584 --> 00:56:28.087
I spent all that time

653
00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:30.622
making a special day
for your birthday

654
00:56:30.723 --> 00:56:32.391
and you just sat there.

655
00:56:32.424 --> 00:56:35.060
You just sat there
and watched me do it.

656
00:56:35.094 --> 00:56:37.429
And you didn't even hand
out the invitations!

657
00:56:37.495 --> 00:56:38.764
Why?

658
00:56:38.797 --> 00:56:39.732
Why would you do that?

659
00:56:39.765 --> 00:56:41.266
Cody.

660
00:56:41.333 --> 00:56:42.668
Cody. no.

661
00:56:42.768 --> 00:56:44.436
Cody. come back here.

662
00:56:47.239 --> 00:56:48.240
Cody.

663
00:56:48.273 --> 00:56:49.908
Cody.

664
00:56:49.942 --> 00:56:51.310
Cody. stop it right now.

665
00:56:51.410 --> 00:56:53.612
- Now. tell me!
- Because they wouldn't come.

666
00:56:53.679 --> 00:56:55.681
You don't listen to me.
You don't listen to anyone!

667
00:56:55.781 --> 00:56:56.949
How would you know that?

668
00:56:57.016 --> 00:56:57.950
You didn't even
give them a chance.

669
00:56:57.983 --> 00:56:58.784
Because I'm not like them.

670
00:56:58.817 --> 00:56:59.752
I hate it here.

671
00:56:59.785 --> 00:57:01.253
I want to go home.

672
00:57:01.286 --> 00:57:03.288
We are not going back there.
Do you hear me?

673
00:57:06.258 --> 00:57:08.827
Cody.

674
00:57:12.131 --> 00:57:13.298
Cody. what...

675
00:57:13.332 --> 00:57:14.666
What is wrong with you?

676
00:57:14.767 --> 00:57:15.767
Cody. Cody.

677
00:57:15.801 --> 00:57:16.702
please.

678
00:57:16.802 --> 00:57:18.137
I'm so sorry.

679
00:57:18.170 --> 00:57:19.705
Okay.

680
00:57:19.805 --> 00:57:22.207
Breathe with Mommy.
Breathe. baby.

681
00:57:42.161 --> 00:57:43.862
If you start to feel bad again.

682
00:57:43.962 --> 00:57:46.031
you just tell the teacher. okay?

683
00:57:46.131 --> 00:57:47.866
Okay.

684
00:58:05.851 --> 00:58:07.319
Laura.

685
00:58:09.822 --> 00:58:11.223
Laura.

686
00:58:14.393 --> 00:58:16.195
Laura!

687
00:58:16.228 --> 00:58:19.031
I need that new DM 40
on my desk in an hour.

688
00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:24.536
The DM4's the most
crucial form in the file.

689
00:58:24.603 --> 00:58:26.872
Hey. Cody. how was your day?

690
00:58:26.939 --> 00:58:29.541
- It was okay.
- Yeah?

691
00:58:33.712 --> 00:58:37.349
Cody. have you been
teasing those little girls?

692
00:58:39.585 --> 00:58:40.686
No.

693
00:58:40.719 --> 00:58:42.121
Are you sure?

694
00:58:42.221 --> 00:58:43.555
Yes.

695
00:58:43.589 --> 00:58:46.525
'Cause I can see them
tattling on you to a teacher.

696
00:58:49.394 --> 00:58:50.905
Do you want to give me
your side of the story

697
00:58:50.929 --> 00:58:52.564
before I get a call tonight?

698
00:58:52.598 --> 00:58:54.399
I didn't do anything.

699
00:58:55.033 --> 00:58:57.069
All right.
I'll wait for the call.

700
00:59:36.742 --> 00:59:38.410
Mrs. Langtree?

701
00:59:39.678 --> 00:59:41.847
Oh. oh. hello.

702
00:59:41.947 --> 00:59:44.750
I was just checking
on the appliances.

703
00:59:44.783 --> 00:59:46.518
- Really?
- Yeah.

704
00:59:46.619 --> 00:59:49.288
I don't think so.
I think you were snooping.

705
00:59:49.321 --> 00:59:51.857
Did you find the drugs
you were looking for?

706
00:59:51.957 --> 00:59:53.325
You know. this is my house

707
00:59:53.392 --> 00:59:55.069
so I can actually check
on it anytime I want.

708
00:59:55.093 --> 00:59:56.404
Not without my
permission. you can't.

709
00:59:56.428 --> 00:59:58.096
And if you'd like
to validate that.

710
00:59:58.130 --> 00:59:59.765
we can call the police.

711
00:59:59.798 --> 01:00:01.366
The police?

712
01:00:01.466 --> 01:00:03.135
Mm-hmm.

713
01:00:03.802 --> 01:00:06.606
Is there something
wrong with you?

714
01:00:06.639 --> 01:00:09.642
Because I think there's
something terribly wrong

715
01:00:09.708 --> 01:00:11.043
going on in this house.

716
01:00:11.143 --> 01:00:12.110
Well. when you figure it out.

717
01:00:12.144 --> 01:00:13.779
will you give me a holler?

718
01:00:13.812 --> 01:00:16.048
Because I would
just love to know.

719
01:00:16.148 --> 01:00:19.652
I want you out of this house.

720
01:00:19.686 --> 01:00:21.820
You have 30 days.

721
01:00:21.887 --> 01:00:23.488
Put it in writing.

722
01:00:23.522 --> 01:00:24.723
Oh. I will.

723
01:00:24.823 --> 01:00:26.693
30 days.

724
01:02:05.490 --> 01:02:07.592
Cody. no!

725
01:02:12.732 --> 01:02:14.166
Cody.

726
01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:30.849
Hello.

727
01:02:30.949 --> 01:02:32.785
Where are you?

728
01:02:32.819 --> 01:02:34.119
I'm ready.

729
01:02:42.795 --> 01:02:44.196
Cody?

730
01:02:45.597 --> 01:02:46.766
Cody?

731
01:02:48.133 --> 01:02:49.802
Cody. stop!

732
01:03:45.590 --> 01:03:47.526
Cody. Cody.

733
01:03:47.592 --> 01:03:48.761
Please breathe.

734
01:03:48.861 --> 01:03:50.095
Breathe. baby.

735
01:03:50.195 --> 01:03:52.899
There. That's right. baby.
That's right.

736
01:03:52.998 --> 01:03:54.199
You're okay.

737
01:03:54.232 --> 01:03:57.202
Oh. Cody. Cody.

738
01:04:00.105 --> 01:04:02.842
Cody.

739
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:39.645
I've had repeated complaints

740
01:04:39.745 --> 01:04:42.748
about the DM 40 being filed
incorrectly or incomplete.

741
01:04:42.782 --> 01:04:44.784
not attaching your
correspondence

742
01:04:44.884 --> 01:04:46.084
to the proper files.

743
01:04:46.151 --> 01:04:48.153
I'll try to get better at that.

744
01:04:48.253 --> 01:04:51.256
It's extremely important
that you maintain

745
01:04:51.289 --> 01:04:54.192
proper maintenance of the
files for the auditors.

746
01:04:54.292 --> 01:04:56.094
We're graded on accuracy.

747
01:04:56.161 --> 01:04:58.163
There're fines implemented

748
01:04:58.263 --> 01:05:00.633
if we don't meet
a certain standard.

749
01:05:00.733 --> 01:05:03.803
I understand.

750
01:05:03.903 --> 01:05:06.772
Laura. I have to ask you
a personal question.

751
01:05:08.139 --> 01:05:09.742
Have you been drinking?

752
01:05:11.009 --> 01:05:14.680
I know you have. I can smell it.

753
01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:16.782
We don't tolerate
drinking on the job.

754
01:05:16.816 --> 01:05:19.150
That's clearly stated
in your employee handbook.

755
01:05:19.251 --> 01:05:20.786
Yes. it is.

756
01:05:20.853 --> 01:05:22.655
I know because I read it.

757
01:05:25.758 --> 01:05:28.326
But I think that if you had
my job. you'd be drinking too.

758
01:05:28.426 --> 01:05:31.296
You try leaving your
family and your friends

759
01:05:31.329 --> 01:05:32.798
and everything you've ever known

760
01:05:32.832 --> 01:05:35.701
to move to this small town
in the middle of nowhere.

761
01:05:35.801 --> 01:05:36.969
all by yourself.

762
01:05:37.035 --> 01:05:40.305
simply because no one
gave you any other choice.

763
01:05:40.338 --> 01:05:42.307
Then talk to me about
drinking on the job.

764
01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:43.341
Laura. look.

765
01:05:43.441 --> 01:05:44.777
Or maybe there's
a company manual

766
01:05:44.810 --> 01:05:47.813
on how to get rid of a monster.

767
01:05:47.847 --> 01:05:50.482
And I'm not talking
about my ex-husband

768
01:05:50.515 --> 01:05:54.887
or my entire
overwhelming situation.

769
01:05:54.987 --> 01:05:58.991
No. I am talking about
an actual monster

770
01:05:59.025 --> 01:06:00.525
who comes into my house

771
01:06:00.559 --> 01:06:01.961
in the middle of the night

772
01:06:01.994 --> 01:06:03.361
and tries to drag my son out

773
01:06:03.461 --> 01:06:05.698
and drown him in
a pond out back.

774
01:06:08.567 --> 01:06:10.670
I know you think I'm nuts.

775
01:06:10.703 --> 01:06:12.203
No.

776
01:06:12.304 --> 01:06:13.338
I don't think that.

777
01:06:13.405 --> 01:06:15.041
I think you need help.

778
01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:16.374
I do not need help.

779
01:06:16.474 --> 01:06:18.744
I have everything
completely under control.

780
01:06:18.844 --> 01:06:20.478
No. you don't.

781
01:06:20.512 --> 01:06:23.515
There's no reason we
can't help women like you.

782
01:06:23.548 --> 01:06:24.750
There's a number there.

783
01:06:24.850 --> 01:06:28.821
Call it. speak to
a nurse or counselor.

784
01:06:28.854 --> 01:06:34.292
Actually. I think
you should keep this

785
01:06:34.392 --> 01:06:35.503
because I don't want your help

786
01:06:35.527 --> 01:06:37.863
and I don't want
your miserable job.

787
01:06:37.930 --> 01:06:39.331
Then go.

788
01:06:39.364 --> 01:06:40.833
I'm gone. daddy-o.

789
01:07:18.704 --> 01:07:20.238
Whoa.

790
01:07:20.305 --> 01:07:22.374
Look at you.

791
01:07:22.407 --> 01:07:24.076
Ginger Rogers.

792
01:07:24.110 --> 01:07:27.079
Your beer is empty.

793
01:07:27.113 --> 01:07:28.413
I'm going to buy you another.

794
01:07:28.446 --> 01:07:29.915
Bartender. can he have another?

795
01:07:29.949 --> 01:07:31.917
And can I have
another one of those?

796
01:07:31.951 --> 01:07:32.718
No. no. no. please.

797
01:07:32.752 --> 01:07:34.219
You. you don't buy me a drink.

798
01:07:34.252 --> 01:07:35.755
Come on. I'm celebrating.

799
01:07:35.788 --> 01:07:37.255
Oh. what are we celebrating?

800
01:07:37.288 --> 01:07:39.091
I quit my job today.

801
01:07:39.125 --> 01:07:40.926
I hated it so I quit it.

802
01:07:40.993 --> 01:07:42.460
Atta girl.

803
01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:43.896
I like your style.

804
01:07:43.929 --> 01:07:47.298
I'll tell you what.
I'll get you that drink

805
01:07:47.399 --> 01:07:50.235
if you come dance with me.

806
01:07:50.268 --> 01:07:51.937
Oh.

807
01:07:52.004 --> 01:07:52.938
Come on.

808
01:07:53.005 --> 01:07:54.774
One dance.

809
01:07:59.612 --> 01:08:00.980
You know this song?

810
01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:02.280
Mm-mm.

811
01:08:02.313 --> 01:08:05.350
Yeah. well.
it's old and forgotten.

812
01:08:05.450 --> 01:08:07.920
Kinda like me.

813
01:08:07.953 --> 01:08:09.354
But. you.

814
01:08:09.454 --> 01:08:12.925
you are a pretty young thing

815
01:08:12.958 --> 01:08:16.662
in a pretty little
polka dot dress.

816
01:08:19.464 --> 01:08:21.100
You look like an angel.

817
01:08:22.434 --> 01:08:24.804
I mean like...

818
01:08:24.837 --> 01:08:27.973
like I died and went to heaven.

819
01:08:30.676 --> 01:08:31.977
I was an angel once

820
01:08:32.011 --> 01:08:34.512
in a play at church.

821
01:08:35.681 --> 01:08:39.652
My grandmother made me the
most beautiful angel wings.

822
01:08:39.719 --> 01:08:42.855
I felt like I could
fly in those wings.

823
01:08:42.955 --> 01:08:44.123
A girl like you.

824
01:08:44.156 --> 01:08:46.826
you don't need wings to fly.

825
01:08:46.859 --> 01:08:48.493
No. I have a car.

826
01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:50.996
Oh. well. that'll do.

827
01:08:51.063 --> 01:08:52.064
That's pretty good.

828
01:08:52.832 --> 01:08:55.067
So what are you going
to do next. angel?

829
01:08:59.004 --> 01:09:01.874
I don't know.

830
01:09:01.974 --> 01:09:03.075
I don't know.

831
01:09:04.977 --> 01:09:05.745
Hey. hey. hey.

832
01:09:05.845 --> 01:09:06.411
Don't cry.

833
01:09:06.511 --> 01:09:07.713
Don't cry.

834
01:09:07.813 --> 01:09:09.253
You're going to
figure something out.

835
01:09:11.516 --> 01:09:14.019
I just wish I could
go somewhere else.

836
01:09:14.086 --> 01:09:16.088
you know. somewhere new

837
01:09:16.188 --> 01:09:17.555
and start fresh.

838
01:09:17.656 --> 01:09:19.591
Just. just start over.

839
01:09:20.893 --> 01:09:23.195
Then you go.

840
01:09:23.229 --> 01:09:27.365
you dig out those pretty
little wings of yours

841
01:09:27.432 --> 01:09:31.036
and you fly. fly. fly.

842
01:10:01.399 --> 01:10:02.601
Cody.

843
01:10:04.103 --> 01:10:05.104
Do you know Cody Butler?

844
01:10:05.204 --> 01:10:06.244
Have you seen Cody Butler?

845
01:10:06.304 --> 01:10:07.304
No.

846
01:10:09.074 --> 01:10:10.441
Cody?

847
01:10:12.745 --> 01:10:14.379
Do you know Cody Butler?

848
01:10:14.412 --> 01:10:17.249
Hey. do you know Cody Butler?

849
01:10:17.315 --> 01:10:19.752
Cody?

850
01:10:19.785 --> 01:10:22.822
Hey. hey. do you
know Cody Butler?

851
01:10:22.922 --> 01:10:24.589
No?

852
01:10:28.493 --> 01:10:30.428
Have you seen Cody Butler?

853
01:10:36.769 --> 01:10:37.837
How are you today. ma'am?

854
01:10:37.937 --> 01:10:40.639
Officer. I came
to pick up my son

855
01:10:40.739 --> 01:10:42.141
and I can't find him anywhere.

856
01:10:42.241 --> 01:10:43.776
Okay. okay.
It's all right. ma'am.

857
01:10:43.809 --> 01:10:45.110
What's your son's name?

858
01:10:45.177 --> 01:10:46.444
His name is Cody Butler.

859
01:10:46.511 --> 01:10:48.747
He's a second grade student.

860
01:10:48.781 --> 01:10:50.616
I'm afraid that my ex-husband

861
01:10:50.683 --> 01:10:52.785
has taken him
without my knowledge.

862
01:10:52.818 --> 01:10:54.086
Okay. well. we're going to get

863
01:10:54.119 --> 01:10:55.988
- to the bottom of this. okay?
- Okay.

864
01:10:56.088 --> 01:10:57.599
Do you. do you
have any identification?

865
01:10:57.623 --> 01:10:58.924
For Cody?

866
01:10:58.958 --> 01:11:00.491
No. ma'am. your identification.

867
01:11:06.298 --> 01:11:07.465
Hi. Laura.

868
01:11:07.498 --> 01:11:08.834
I'm Barb Schiff.

869
01:11:08.934 --> 01:11:10.703
I'm a caseworker
with the department.

870
01:11:10.803 --> 01:11:12.638
I'm sorry it took me
so long to get here.

871
01:11:12.705 --> 01:11:15.140
How are you?

872
01:11:15.174 --> 01:11:16.642
Where is Cody?

873
01:11:16.709 --> 01:11:18.787
I went to school to pick
him up and he was not there.

874
01:11:18.811 --> 01:11:20.279
No. he wasn't.

875
01:11:20.312 --> 01:11:23.514
Where do you think he is?

876
01:11:23.616 --> 01:11:24.717
Does his dad have him?

877
01:11:24.817 --> 01:11:26.986
No. he doesn't.

878
01:11:27.019 --> 01:11:28.486
How do you know?

879
01:11:28.519 --> 01:11:30.055
Did you call him?

880
01:11:30.155 --> 01:11:32.457
I didn't need to.

881
01:11:32.490 --> 01:11:35.327
What do you mean?

882
01:11:35.393 --> 01:11:37.830
Laura.

883
01:11:37.863 --> 01:11:40.900
would you mind if we
backed up a little bit?

884
01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.002
I think I could be of more help

885
01:11:43.068 --> 01:11:46.372
if I understood the
details of Cody's accident.

886
01:11:46.471 --> 01:11:51.076
I'm referring to the accident
last year in Arizona.

887
01:11:53.345 --> 01:11:54.680
Oh.

888
01:11:55.714 --> 01:11:57.249
Well. that was nothing.

889
01:11:57.349 --> 01:11:59.251
He fell in the pool.

890
01:12:03.155 --> 01:12:04.555
I wasn't there.

891
01:12:04.657 --> 01:12:07.793
I had to go to
the grocery store.

892
01:12:07.893 --> 01:12:10.930
His father was watching him.

893
01:12:14.099 --> 01:12:17.036
When I came home. Scott was on
the couch. watching the game

894
01:12:17.069 --> 01:12:18.871
and I went into the kitchen

895
01:12:18.904 --> 01:12:23.275
and I had this weird feeling
like something wrong.

896
01:12:23.375 --> 01:12:24.710
And I was standing at the sink

897
01:12:24.777 --> 01:12:26.497
and I was looking out
the window at the pool

898
01:12:26.544 --> 01:12:28.614
and I thought I saw
something in it.

899
01:12:29.281 --> 01:12:33.052
When I went out to check.
I saw that it was him.

900
01:12:33.852 --> 01:12:37.790
And then what happened?

901
01:12:38.891 --> 01:12:41.293
Well. I dragged him out

902
01:12:41.393 --> 01:12:42.593
and I performed CPR on him

903
01:12:42.695 --> 01:12:44.396
until the paramedics came

904
01:12:44.462 --> 01:12:49.068
and then they revived him
and he was completely okay.

905
01:12:52.071 --> 01:12:53.639
Why?

906
01:12:54.472 --> 01:12:56.809
Are you saying there's
something wrong with him

907
01:12:56.909 --> 01:12:58.543
because of what happened?

908
01:12:58.576 --> 01:13:00.478
No. that is not what I'm saying.

909
01:13:18.831 --> 01:13:20.833
It's okay. Laura.

910
01:13:20.933 --> 01:13:22.901
You're all right.

911
01:13:31.944 --> 01:13:34.446
I think I need some water.

912
01:13:36.015 --> 01:13:37.316
Okay.

913
01:13:37.416 --> 01:13:38.416
You sit tight.

914
01:13:38.450 --> 01:13:39.752
I'll get you one.

915
01:16:18.443 --> 01:16:19.778
Cody!

916
01:16:24.917 --> 01:16:26.285
Cody!

917
01:16:28.987 --> 01:16:30.422
Cody. open the door.

918
01:16:57.149 --> 01:16:59.851
- Cody. where are you?
- I'm right here.

919
01:16:59.952 --> 01:17:01.820
Cody! Cody.

920
01:17:01.853 --> 01:17:03.555
What happened?

921
01:17:03.656 --> 01:17:05.157
Where have you been?

922
01:17:05.190 --> 01:17:06.892
Honey. why didn't
you wait for me

923
01:17:06.992 --> 01:17:08.393
to pick you up from school?

924
01:17:08.493 --> 01:17:11.396
It's time
for me to go home. Mom.

925
01:17:11.496 --> 01:17:12.998
No. no. no.

926
01:17:13.065 --> 01:17:15.133
I'm going to take you
somewhere else. okay?

927
01:17:15.167 --> 01:17:16.311
I'm going to take
you away from here.

928
01:17:16.335 --> 01:17:18.003
That's what you want. right?

929
01:17:18.070 --> 01:17:19.905
We're going to pack up the car

930
01:17:20.005 --> 01:17:21.674
and we're going to go
somewhere brand new

931
01:17:21.708 --> 01:17:24.209
and we're going to have
a fresh start. okay?

932
01:17:24.309 --> 01:17:25.811
Okay?

933
01:17:25.844 --> 01:17:28.747
I don't want to.

934
01:17:28.847 --> 01:17:32.050
Well. you have to. Mommy says.

935
01:17:32.150 --> 01:17:36.555
So go upstairs
and pack up your stuff.

936
01:17:42.227 --> 01:17:44.029
Cody. where are you going?

937
01:17:44.096 --> 01:17:45.698
- I'm not going.
- No. No.

938
01:17:45.732 --> 01:17:46.733
- Please.
- No!

939
01:17:46.832 --> 01:17:48.066
Please. let me...!

940
01:17:48.166 --> 01:17:52.037
- Cody. go upstairs.
- Please. let me go!

941
01:17:52.104 --> 01:17:53.372
- Cody!
- Please!

942
01:17:53.438 --> 01:17:56.575
No! Cody! Stop it! Stop it!

943
01:18:00.445 --> 01:18:01.947
I'm so sorry.

944
01:19:09.348 --> 01:19:11.751
Cody. Cody. Cody.

945
01:19:22.762 --> 01:19:24.529
Cody.

946
01:19:27.599 --> 01:19:29.468
Cody.

947
01:19:31.103 --> 01:19:32.871
Cody. please don't leave me.

948
01:19:32.971 --> 01:19:37.542
I want to go with
the pretty lady.

949
01:19:37.643 --> 01:19:39.010
No. no.

950
01:19:39.111 --> 01:19:40.512
Don't say that.

951
01:19:40.613 --> 01:19:41.814
Don't say that.

952
01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:46.451
You want to stay here with me.

953
01:19:46.485 --> 01:19:49.789
You have to let me go. Mom.

954
01:19:49.822 --> 01:19:51.791
Why?

955
01:19:54.861 --> 01:19:57.996
It wasn't your fault. Mom.

956
01:20:00.833 --> 01:20:01.834
It wasn't on purpose.

957
01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:03.001
It was an accident.

958
01:20:03.068 --> 01:20:04.136
It's okay.

959
01:20:04.169 --> 01:20:05.237
It's not okay.

960
01:20:05.337 --> 01:20:07.640
It will be. you'll see.

961
01:20:07.673 --> 01:20:12.411
Please. Cody. I don't
want you to leave me.

962
01:20:12.511 --> 01:20:15.147
You have to let me go. Mom.

963
01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:17.983
Please. Please.

964
01:23:15.695 --> 01:23:17.529
I can't believe she did this.

965
01:23:17.562 --> 01:23:19.230
The pipe burst.

966
01:23:19.331 --> 01:23:21.734
She broke it. Jim.

967
01:23:21.834 --> 01:23:23.035
What's that?

968
01:23:23.069 --> 01:23:24.837
Jim. Jim.

969
01:23:24.870 --> 01:23:26.839
Jim. what's that piece of paper?

970
01:23:26.872 --> 01:23:28.674
Just hand me...

971
01:24:07.079 --> 01:24:09.414
All right. that should do it.
You're good to go.

972
01:24:09.447 --> 01:24:11.117
Great. Thank you.

973
01:24:11.216 --> 01:24:14.252
- Where did you say you were headed again?
- Home. Mesa.

974
01:24:14.319 --> 01:24:16.421
Oh. it'll make it there.
