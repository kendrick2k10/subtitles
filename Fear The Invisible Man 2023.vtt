3
00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:20.981
Marvel.

4
00:01:45.673 --> 00:01:47.941
It's a beast of a country

5
00:01:48.976 --> 00:01:50.778
and pigs for people.

6
00:01:52.613 --> 00:01:54.582
Relax.

7
00:01:54.582 --> 00:01:56.450
I see you as an outcast.

8
00:01:57.685 --> 00:01:58.886
like myself.

9
00:02:00.354 --> 00:02:03.524
Help me. and I will do
great things for you.

10
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.262
What are you?

11
00:02:08.262 --> 00:02:09.730
An invisible man.

12
00:02:10.898 --> 00:02:13.301
And an invisible man
is a man of power.

13
00:02:14.502 --> 00:02:17.137
but if you betray
me or disobey me.

14
00:03:28.242 --> 00:03:29.076
Griffin!

15
00:03:30.978 --> 00:03:31.812
Griffin!

16
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.682
I know you're in there.

17
00:03:34.682 --> 00:03:36.884
Griffin! You open this door now!

18
00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:39.987
Griffin!

19
00:03:39.987 --> 00:03:42.222
Where's my rent?

20
00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:49.997
I know you're in
there. I can hear you!

21
00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:52.900
Griffin!

22
00:03:54.935 --> 00:03:56.270
Griffin!

23
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.669
What's going on?

24
00:06:07.568 --> 00:06:08.836
Look. Margaret.

25
00:06:08.836 --> 00:06:11.271
an invisible man plagues
the town of Iping.

26
00:06:12.673 --> 00:06:15.743
They claim to have a clergyman
and a doctor as witnesses.

27
00:06:15.743 --> 00:06:18.546
Supposedly. this invisible
man inflicted serious injuries

28
00:06:18.546 --> 00:06:20.380
on our Constable Jaffers.

29
00:06:21.815 --> 00:06:23.083
Clearly. the folk of
Iping have lost the ability

30
00:06:23.083 --> 00:06:24.918
to hear the words coming
out of their own mouths.

31
00:06:24.918 --> 00:06:25.919
What rot.

32
00:06:27.354 --> 00:06:28.522
Honestly. Miss Adeline.

33
00:06:28.522 --> 00:06:29.457
you have better
things to be spending

34
00:06:29.457 --> 00:06:31.191
both your time and money on.

35
00:06:32.693 --> 00:06:35.128
Lord knows this place could
use more of the latter.

36
00:06:36.363 --> 00:06:38.231
And not from pawning
your belongings.

37
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.001
Begging your pardon.

38
00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:46.339
Oh. you think we haven't
noticed the steady disappearance

39
00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:48.809
of all of this household's
valuable works of art?

40
00:06:50.277 --> 00:06:51.779
Never thought I'd see the day.

41
00:06:53.681 --> 00:06:55.716
And letting poor Arthur go.

42
00:06:55.716 --> 00:06:57.851
The best footman you're
ever likely to see.

43
00:07:01.855 --> 00:07:04.224
You'll be selling the
master's chess set next.

44
00:07:04.224 --> 00:07:05.593
Not that. Margaret.

45
00:07:08.496 --> 00:07:09.396
Never that.

46
00:07:17.104 --> 00:07:19.540
He seems to be in
rather a hurry.

47
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.775
Though he doesn't seem
to be getting very far.

48
00:07:25.746 --> 00:07:27.447
Aye. if his pockets
were full of lead.

49
00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:28.649
he couldn't run heavier.

50
00:08:43.256 --> 00:08:44.692
Oi. stranger.

51
00:08:45.893 --> 00:08:46.860
what can I get you?

52
00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:49.062
Your finest.

53
00:08:50.297 --> 00:08:51.298
food and drink.

54
00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:55.468
Get some chicken.

55
00:09:28.535 --> 00:09:29.402
Books?

56
00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:36.910
Yeah.

57
00:09:38.278 --> 00:09:39.279
Yeah. they're books.

58
00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:42.850
Just seems strange is all.

59
00:09:43.984 --> 00:09:46.453
seeing a man such as
yourself carrying books.

60
00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.422
and into a pub of all places.

61
00:09:51.124 --> 00:09:53.493
Some extraordinary
things in books.

62
00:09:54.895 --> 00:09:55.729
Indeed.

63
00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:34.101
You think
you can hide from me?

64
00:10:34.101 --> 00:10:35.435
Oi! What's going
on over there?

65
00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:41.474
He's gone mad. grab him!

66
00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:43.410
Steady. steady.

67
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:44.211
Steady.

68
00:11:03.396 --> 00:11:04.998
Marvel!

69
00:13:56.636 --> 00:13:57.437
Adeline.

70
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.274
Is that you?

71
00:14:04.411 --> 00:14:06.446
Help me. Adeline.

72
00:14:06.446 --> 00:14:08.148
It's me. Griffin.

73
00:14:08.148 --> 00:14:09.349
Griffin?

74
00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:12.185
Well. what in the
world? Show yourself!

75
00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.198
Steady
yourself. Adeline!

76
00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:26.366
For God's sake!

77
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.635
I want help badly.

78
00:14:28.635 --> 00:14:29.702
I've been shot!

79
00:14:30.904 --> 00:14:34.307
I'm nauseous and ill.

80
00:14:34.307 --> 00:14:36.910
Just stop!

81
00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:38.078
Please. just help me!

82
00:14:45.518 --> 00:14:46.353
Griffin?

83
00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:49.722
How can this be?

84
00:14:50.757 --> 00:14:52.225
Are you a ghost?

85
00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:54.427
Ghost.

86
00:14:54.427 --> 00:14:56.596
Here I thought you were
a woman of science.

87
00:14:58.031 --> 00:15:00.100
You recall our
days at university?

88
00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:03.836
My experiments on
matter and light.

89
00:15:03.836 --> 00:15:05.338
on vision and visibility.

90
00:15:06.539 --> 00:15:08.075
The invisible man.

91
00:15:10.043 --> 00:15:11.878
Oh my God. you've done it.

92
00:15:11.878 --> 00:15:13.280
Look. Adeline.

93
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.581
I'm starving and freezing.

94
00:15:14.581 --> 00:15:17.084
Have you got a dressing gown?

95
00:15:17.084 --> 00:15:18.885
You can find some
of Reginald's clothes

96
00:15:18.885 --> 00:15:20.487
in the wardrobe.

97
00:15:20.487 --> 00:15:22.622
Use one of his
shirts as a bandage.

98
00:15:24.057 --> 00:15:25.192
Where were you shot?

99
00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.329
The bullet
passed through my arm.

100
00:15:50.083 --> 00:15:51.684
I could use your help with this.

101
00:16:05.398 --> 00:16:07.567
Hold your arm up
where I need to wrap it.

102
00:16:09.169 --> 00:16:10.670
It's
right in front of you.

103
00:16:39.366 --> 00:16:41.468
I'd forgotten how
tender was your touch.

104
00:16:42.635 --> 00:16:44.404
How terribly it pained me.

105
00:16:51.978 --> 00:16:52.812
My blood. it.

106
00:16:54.314 --> 00:16:56.183
it turns visible
when it coagulates.

107
00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:00.220
Reginald.

108
00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:01.321
where is the old chap?

109
00:17:01.321 --> 00:17:03.056
He passed away.

110
00:17:03.056 --> 00:17:03.923
What?

111
00:17:04.924 --> 00:17:07.694
Oh. I am so sorry to hear that.

112
00:17:07.694 --> 00:17:09.196
Truly. I am.

113
00:17:09.196 --> 00:17:11.298
Look. you must
forgive me. Adeline.

114
00:17:11.298 --> 00:17:12.665
Coming here without
an invitation

115
00:17:12.665 --> 00:17:14.534
after so many years.

116
00:17:14.534 --> 00:17:15.768
I had nowhere else to go.

117
00:17:16.969 --> 00:17:18.905
You may stay in
here for tonight.

118
00:17:18.905 --> 00:17:19.972
And food?

119
00:17:21.308 --> 00:17:23.210
I'll fetch you something
from the kitchen.

120
00:19:28.335 --> 00:19:29.336
Oh. Griffin.

121
00:19:30.403 --> 00:19:32.004
what have you done?

122
00:19:42.815 --> 00:19:44.083
Morning. ma'am.

123
00:19:44.083 --> 00:19:45.485
Oh. please. let me
carry that for you.

124
00:19:45.485 --> 00:19:47.420
No. I'm perfectly capable

125
00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.622
of preparing my
own breakfast tray.

126
00:19:49.622 --> 00:19:51.057
Thank you.

127
00:19:51.057 --> 00:19:51.891
Mrs. Kemp.

128
00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:55.061
I couldn't enter your
room to clean it.

129
00:19:55.061 --> 00:19:56.696
I don't want it cleaned.

130
00:19:56.696 --> 00:19:59.599
In fact. just stay out of my
room until further notice.

131
00:19:59.599 --> 00:20:00.633
Yes. ma'am.

132
00:20:00.633 --> 00:20:01.568
Apologies. ma'am.

133
00:20:22.755 --> 00:20:23.590
Griffin?

134
00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:46.779
Are we alone?

135
00:20:48.147 --> 00:20:49.616
Yes. I sent the girl away.

136
00:20:51.884 --> 00:20:54.186
What happened to you. Griffin?

137
00:20:54.186 --> 00:20:55.288
How did you end up at my house

138
00:20:55.288 --> 00:20:56.889
in this condition and bleeding?

139
00:20:56.889 --> 00:20:58.891
I recalled you
and Reginald had settled

140
00:20:58.891 --> 00:21:00.693
in Port Burdock.

141
00:21:00.693 --> 00:21:02.161
I hoped for shelter.

142
00:21:02.161 --> 00:21:05.765
perhaps for Reginald to help
with aspects of my experiments.

143
00:21:06.966 --> 00:21:09.569
Even with his
childish understanding.

144
00:21:09.569 --> 00:21:10.703
Childish?

145
00:21:10.703 --> 00:21:11.938
He was a brilliant man!

146
00:21:11.938 --> 00:21:14.541
He was
closed-minded and small.

147
00:21:14.541 --> 00:21:15.675
Still.

148
00:21:15.675 --> 00:21:17.009
he may have had some use

149
00:21:17.009 --> 00:21:18.911
with the right instruction.

150
00:21:18.911 --> 00:21:20.347
Your jealousy was
always beneath you.

151
00:21:20.347 --> 00:21:21.981
Reginald was the best of us.

152
00:21:28.521 --> 00:21:30.923
Have you turned your
clothes invisible?

153
00:21:30.923 --> 00:21:32.124
No.

154
00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:34.226
My formula only works
on living matter.

155
00:21:35.227 --> 00:21:37.129
Then you're wearing nothing.

156
00:21:39.432 --> 00:21:41.834
I must ask you to
make yourself decent.

157
00:21:42.935 --> 00:21:44.704
Always so proper.

158
00:21:45.838 --> 00:21:48.007
Though. one summer
night. I seem to recall-

159
00:21:48.007 --> 00:21:49.208
Griffin. please.

160
00:22:01.954 --> 00:22:04.757
Ah. this is better.

161
00:22:04.757 --> 00:22:06.258
Warmer.

162
00:22:06.258 --> 00:22:09.195
I always admired
Reginald's taste in attire.

163
00:22:10.196 --> 00:22:11.330
He looked well in it.

164
00:22:18.838 --> 00:22:22.108
What do you think?

165
00:22:22.108 --> 00:22:24.711
Perhaps I could even
venture outside like this.

166
00:22:24.711 --> 00:22:27.013
if I kept people from
approaching too closely.

167
00:22:28.214 --> 00:22:31.384
My wound appears to
be healing quickly.

168
00:22:31.384 --> 00:22:32.685
Perhaps a side effect.

169
00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:34.954
I can see from the newspapers

170
00:22:34.954 --> 00:22:36.355
and from the gunfire last night

171
00:22:36.355 --> 00:22:37.824
that others are aware of you.

172
00:22:39.926 --> 00:22:41.761
How did you get shot?

173
00:22:41.761 --> 00:22:43.530
There was
a real fool of a man.

174
00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:46.298
a sort of confederate of mine.

175
00:22:46.298 --> 00:22:47.434
curse him.

176
00:22:47.434 --> 00:22:49.168
who stole my money.

177
00:22:49.168 --> 00:22:50.670
He created quite
a ruckus in a pub

178
00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:51.971
when I tried to catch him.

179
00:22:51.971 --> 00:22:53.406
Is he invisible too?

180
00:22:53.406 --> 00:22:54.641
No.

181
00:22:54.641 --> 00:22:56.643
I alone possess this power.

182
00:22:56.643 --> 00:22:57.910
Are you a danger to me

183
00:22:57.910 --> 00:22:59.479
and the good people
of this household?

184
00:22:59.479 --> 00:23:01.814
Peace. Adeline.

185
00:23:01.814 --> 00:23:02.882
and patience.

186
00:23:03.883 --> 00:23:05.685
I'll tell you my story.

187
00:23:05.685 --> 00:23:07.720
but first. I need rest.

188
00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:39.652
Good morning. Mrs. Kemp.

189
00:23:45.725 --> 00:23:47.293
Always a pleasure.

190
00:23:47.293 --> 00:23:48.928
Patrolling the neighborhood?

191
00:23:48.928 --> 00:23:50.597
You seem rather overstaffed.

192
00:23:51.798 --> 00:23:53.399
I wish it were a patrol.

193
00:23:53.399 --> 00:23:55.735
This is a manhunt.

194
00:23:56.703 --> 00:23:58.170
Oh dear.

195
00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:00.206
I've sent men with tracking
dogs to sweep the forest

196
00:24:00.206 --> 00:24:02.008
on both sides of the road.

197
00:24:02.008 --> 00:24:04.310
so if you hear their
racket. don't be alarmed.

198
00:24:05.678 --> 00:24:06.913
I heard a vagrant
caused a brawl last night

199
00:24:06.913 --> 00:24:08.481
at the Jolly Cricketers.

200
00:24:08.481 --> 00:24:10.382
You are pursuing him?

201
00:24:10.382 --> 00:24:14.020
News travels surprisingly
quick here in the outskirts.

202
00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.188
No said vagrant. quite
a twitchy fellow.

203
00:24:17.924 --> 00:24:19.325
Then whom are you hunting?

204
00:24:20.192 --> 00:24:21.393
Well.

205
00:24:21.393 --> 00:24:22.729
our friendly drifter claimed

206
00:24:22.729 --> 00:24:26.633
that an invisible
man tried to kill him

207
00:24:26.633 --> 00:24:28.635
and caused the
disturbance at the pub.

208
00:24:28.635 --> 00:24:31.604
He begged to be locked
in our most secure cell.

209
00:24:31.604 --> 00:24:33.339
Surely you
didn't indulge him.

210
00:24:33.339 --> 00:24:35.174
Oh. I had a good mind to.

211
00:24:35.174 --> 00:24:37.209
Poor PC Collins got
shot on his account.

212
00:24:37.209 --> 00:24:38.611
Oh. he'll be all right.

213
00:24:40.046 --> 00:24:42.682
That crazed man wasn't the
one who pulled the trigger.

214
00:24:42.682 --> 00:24:45.051
We're here because.
invisible man or not.

215
00:24:45.051 --> 00:24:47.086
we did find a trail
of blood in the street

216
00:24:47.086 --> 00:24:49.622
leading out of town towards
this general direction.

217
00:24:51.023 --> 00:24:52.659
Whoever he is.

218
00:24:52.659 --> 00:24:55.061
the man seems smart enough
to staunch his own bleeding

219
00:24:55.061 --> 00:24:56.929
and avoid the road.

220
00:24:56.929 --> 00:24:58.998
We lost his trail a
good distance back.

221
00:25:01.167 --> 00:25:04.336
Have you experienced any
suspicious occurrences

222
00:25:04.336 --> 00:25:05.171
since last night?

223
00:25:06.573 --> 00:25:07.774
Strange noises.

224
00:25:09.008 --> 00:25:10.109
broken window.

225
00:25:10.109 --> 00:25:11.443
missing any food or supplies?

226
00:25:11.443 --> 00:25:12.278
No.

227
00:25:12.278 --> 00:25:13.646
No.

228
00:25:13.646 --> 00:25:15.047
Nothing like that.

229
00:25:15.047 --> 00:25:15.882
Thank heaven.

230
00:25:17.216 --> 00:25:18.985
Keeping you safe
is my sacred duty.

231
00:25:20.152 --> 00:25:22.454
Please. continue to
take all precautions.

232
00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:25.257
What happened to the vagrant?

233
00:25:27.326 --> 00:25:30.296
I locked him up for the
night for instigating the brawl

234
00:25:30.296 --> 00:25:32.264
then released him
earlier this morning.

235
00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.968
You sent a mentally disturbed
man out into the street?

236
00:25:37.403 --> 00:25:39.205
I run the police
station. Mrs. Kemp.

237
00:25:39.205 --> 00:25:40.106
not an asylum.

238
00:25:41.874 --> 00:25:43.743
If you'd support me in
my letters to the mayor

239
00:25:43.743 --> 00:25:44.777
and to the city council.

240
00:25:44.777 --> 00:25:46.212
Port Burdock would build one.

241
00:25:47.079 --> 00:25:48.147
A more humane one.

242
00:25:49.616 --> 00:25:51.417
The people here
respect you enough.

243
00:25:53.786 --> 00:25:55.054
Supporting the view

244
00:25:55.054 --> 00:25:57.724
in your letters means
supporting new taxes.

245
00:25:59.225 --> 00:26:00.059
which I don't.

246
00:26:03.095 --> 00:26:05.898
I heard the vagrant was
carrying a large sum of money.

247
00:26:07.099 --> 00:26:08.534
What exactly is your
interest in this man?

248
00:26:08.534 --> 00:26:11.337
You know I work
with the unfortunate.

249
00:26:11.337 --> 00:26:13.239
Your interest seems
rather more specific.

250
00:26:13.239 --> 00:26:14.607
Can't
a lady indulge

251
00:26:14.607 --> 00:26:16.242
in some idle
neighborhood gossip?

252
00:26:19.045 --> 00:26:20.747
Perhaps I could
visit you again.

253
00:26:21.714 --> 00:26:23.349
We'll talk about this gossip.

254
00:26:23.349 --> 00:26:25.251
It seems here the
grapevine is more efficient

255
00:26:25.251 --> 00:26:26.653
than the telegram.

256
00:26:36.095 --> 00:26:36.929
Good day.

257
00:26:40.099 --> 00:26:41.701
Ma'am.

258
00:26:41.701 --> 00:26:43.535
How do you do. William?

259
00:26:43.535 --> 00:26:45.705
As always. thank you
for your service.

260
00:26:47.173 --> 00:26:48.875
Can you tell me. has anyone
died because of this drifter

261
00:26:48.875 --> 00:26:50.710
or anything at all
related to him?

262
00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:52.278
Not so far.

263
00:26:52.278 --> 00:26:53.279
Thank the good Lord.

264
00:26:55.648 --> 00:26:57.383
Look. Mrs. Kemp.

265
00:26:57.383 --> 00:26:58.685
we attend the same meetings.

266
00:26:58.685 --> 00:27:00.987
I support your politics.

267
00:27:00.987 --> 00:27:02.454
You like to help people in need.

268
00:27:02.454 --> 00:27:05.424
and I'm happy to feed you
information from time to time.

269
00:27:05.424 --> 00:27:07.326
but please.

270
00:27:07.326 --> 00:27:09.796
don't go looking
to help this one.

271
00:27:09.796 --> 00:27:11.230
I've not seen him before.

272
00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:13.065
and I know all the pikers
around these parts.

273
00:27:14.266 --> 00:27:15.968
Let the bloke move on. eh?

274
00:27:17.203 --> 00:27:19.405
He's bad news for Port Burdock.

275
00:27:19.405 --> 00:27:20.472
PC William?

276
00:28:28.841 --> 00:28:29.675
Griffin?

277
00:28:39.118 --> 00:28:41.821
♪ Who told you
so. dilly. dilly ♪

278
00:28:41.821 --> 00:28:45.224

Oh. forgive me. ma'am.

290
00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:20.226
Did I leave the door open?

291
00:29:20.226 --> 00:29:22.094
Are you all right
in here by yourself?

292
00:29:22.962 --> 00:29:24.430
Begging your pardon. ma'am.

293
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:25.932
why wouldn't I be?

294
00:29:30.536 --> 00:29:32.271
If you don't mind. ma'am.

295
00:29:32.271 --> 00:29:33.272
Of course.

296
00:29:48.654 --> 00:29:50.089
Well. at least you have the
good sense not to openly move

297
00:29:50.089 --> 00:29:51.723
around the house
until nightfall.

298
00:29:52.992 --> 00:29:55.127
Where did you disappear
to all day long?

299
00:29:56.362 --> 00:29:57.964
If I
didn't know you better.

300
00:29:57.964 --> 00:30:00.532
I would suspect you of
having just made a joke.

301
00:30:02.034 --> 00:30:03.302
Did you wander into town.

302
00:30:03.302 --> 00:30:05.771
or were you inside
my house lurking?

303
00:30:05.771 --> 00:30:07.039
I was out.

304
00:30:07.039 --> 00:30:08.474
gathering useful knowledge.

305
00:30:09.775 --> 00:30:12.278
I saw you speaking
to the police.

306
00:30:12.278 --> 00:30:13.812
Learn anything interesting?

307
00:30:13.812 --> 00:30:15.047
I learnt that
you came off worse

308
00:30:15.047 --> 00:30:16.815
in the scuffle you instigated.

309
00:30:18.217 --> 00:30:20.519
You don't appear to have
caused any deliberate harm.

310
00:30:21.787 --> 00:30:23.122
You were always
rather a scoundrel.

311
00:30:23.122 --> 00:30:25.591
but I'm relieved to know
you're not irredeemable.

312
00:30:28.427 --> 00:30:30.462
You haven't changed since
our days at university.

313
00:30:30.462 --> 00:30:31.697
Once again. I find you rummaging

314
00:30:31.697 --> 00:30:33.632
through my private correspondence.

315
00:30:33.632 --> 00:30:36.602
Oh. your
precious propriety again.

316
00:30:36.602 --> 00:30:38.204
Had you more
respect for propriety

317
00:30:38.204 --> 00:30:39.805
and more regard for
the feelings of others.

318
00:30:39.805 --> 00:30:41.573
things might have
ended differently.

319
00:30:50.917 --> 00:30:51.717
No!

320
00:30:55.121 --> 00:30:55.922
Don't.

321
00:30:58.557 --> 00:30:59.358
Please.

322
00:31:04.296 --> 00:31:05.797
It was our last game together.

323
00:31:09.401 --> 00:31:11.870
I still somehow expect
him to make his next move.

324
00:31:15.007 --> 00:31:17.043
You were always a snoop.

325
00:31:17.043 --> 00:31:19.111
always disdainful of
others' boundaries.

326
00:31:20.146 --> 00:31:21.547
It seems you found a way

327
00:31:21.547 --> 00:31:23.549
to make that illicit
behavior nigh undetectable.

328
00:31:23.549 --> 00:31:26.953
I can do many
things while invisible. Adeline.

329
00:31:26.953 --> 00:31:28.955
Things that ordinary men cannot.

330
00:31:28.955 --> 00:31:32.158
things that Reginald
could never do.

331
00:31:32.158 --> 00:31:33.825
For example.

332
00:31:33.825 --> 00:31:36.062
I could save you.

333
00:31:36.062 --> 00:31:37.529
I could save your home.

334
00:31:39.031 --> 00:31:42.601
I thought your household
staff looked a bit sparse.

335
00:31:42.601 --> 00:31:45.004
A girl and an old woman.

336
00:31:49.241 --> 00:31:50.042
Take it.

337
00:31:53.312 --> 00:31:54.280
It's a gift.

338
00:32:01.787 --> 00:32:04.190
I thought you said all
your money had been taken.

339
00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:05.992
Come now. Adeline.

340
00:32:05.992 --> 00:32:07.759
who do you intend
to ask for help?

341
00:32:09.095 --> 00:32:11.430
You don't come from
a prosperous family.

342
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:12.764
They can't shoulder the burden

343
00:32:12.764 --> 00:32:15.134
of your husband's
failed research.

344
00:32:15.134 --> 00:32:17.536
He said he was closer
to a breakthrough.

345
00:32:17.536 --> 00:32:19.271
It would have paid
for everything.

346
00:32:19.271 --> 00:32:21.007
Yes.

347
00:32:21.007 --> 00:32:24.343
I'm familiar with the sweet
siren song of futile hopes.

348
00:32:25.577 --> 00:32:27.679
But with my success.

349
00:32:27.679 --> 00:32:29.381
there's more where
that came from.

350
00:32:30.916 --> 00:32:33.385
if we can come to terms.

351
00:32:35.654 --> 00:32:37.423
You don't have
much time. my dear.

352
00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:40.292
The bank's letter's a week old.

353
00:32:42.094 --> 00:32:43.929
They are coming for you.

354
00:33:31.177 --> 00:33:33.145
Good day. Mrs. Kemp.

355
00:33:33.145 --> 00:33:34.813
Mr. Wicksteed. how are you?

356
00:33:34.813 --> 00:33:36.882
How's things with
the city council?

357
00:33:36.882 --> 00:33:39.818
Port Burdock is
developing remarkably well.

358
00:33:39.818 --> 00:33:41.353
I'm happy to say.

359
00:33:41.353 --> 00:33:44.190
In fact. I've just come from
a meeting with His Lordship.

360
00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:45.657
With a little bit of luck.

361
00:33:45.657 --> 00:33:48.160
our prosperous town may soon
be enjoying the benefits

362
00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.096
of a new electricity
power station.

363
00:33:50.096 --> 00:33:51.997
and before the turn
of the century.

364
00:33:52.864 --> 00:33:54.032
Oh. I'm so delighted to hear

365
00:33:54.032 --> 00:33:56.402
we're making such
heroic strides forward.

366
00:33:56.402 --> 00:33:59.871
Perhaps Port Burdock might
share some of it's prosperities

367
00:33:59.871 --> 00:34:02.674
with the less fortunate.

368
00:34:02.674 --> 00:34:04.076
My dear lady.

369
00:34:04.076 --> 00:34:06.112
I'm not unaware of your
gallant letter-writing campaign

370
00:34:06.112 --> 00:34:08.714
to men of influence
around the town.

371
00:34:08.714 --> 00:34:11.049
but I have to give
you a piece of advice.

372
00:34:11.049 --> 00:34:14.453
It's an old Chinese
proverb. I believe.

373
00:34:14.453 --> 00:34:16.822
Give a man a fish. you
feed him for a day.

374
00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:20.392
Teach a man to fish.
you feed him for life.

375
00:34:21.793 --> 00:34:25.197
Your intentions
were honorable but misguided.

376
00:34:26.132 --> 00:34:28.834
As long as I sit on the council.

377
00:34:28.834 --> 00:34:31.970
your charitable schemes will
never see the light of day.

378
00:34:33.205 --> 00:34:36.642
And if I may be so
bold. Mrs. Kemp.

379
00:34:36.642 --> 00:34:38.610
if I was in your situation.

380
00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:42.414
I'd concentrate on getting my
own financial house in order

381
00:34:42.414 --> 00:34:46.185
before I start telling other
people how to manage theirs.

382
00:35:03.802 --> 00:35:07.306
I am relieved we can avoid
the heartbreaking business

383
00:35:07.306 --> 00:35:10.576
of the bank throwing a
widow out onto the street.

384
00:35:11.477 --> 00:35:12.678
So I have more time?

385
00:35:14.079 --> 00:35:18.016
Uh. making this large payment
means I have the flexibility

386
00:35:18.016 --> 00:35:21.587
to grant you an extension
to repay the balance.

387
00:35:21.587 --> 00:35:24.323
but. um. not long. I'm afraid.

388
00:35:25.657 --> 00:35:26.492
30 days.

389
00:35:34.533 --> 00:35:35.634
Ah. the. uh.

390
00:35:36.535 --> 00:35:37.569
the colonel's arrived.

391
00:35:37.569 --> 00:35:38.404
Um...

392
00:35:39.738 --> 00:35:42.808
Um. a thief broke into
the bank last night

393
00:35:42.808 --> 00:35:44.676
and stole an enormous
sum of money.

394
00:35:46.245 --> 00:35:48.614
If you'll excuse
me. I have some. um.

395
00:35:48.614 --> 00:35:50.516
some unpleasant
business to attend to.

396
00:35:53.519 --> 00:35:54.686
Good morning.

397
00:35:54.686 --> 00:35:55.621
Morning. sir.

398
00:35:55.621 --> 00:35:57.256
Uh. please. come this way.

399
00:37:02.321 --> 00:37:04.690
Like you. Reginald
continued to study the strange

400
00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:07.092
and bizarre aspects of science.

401
00:37:07.092 --> 00:37:08.827
He hoped his research
would earn an admittance

402
00:37:08.827 --> 00:37:10.195
into the Royal Society.

403
00:37:11.363 --> 00:37:13.399
Nothing as impressive
as your discovery. but-

404
00:37:13.399 --> 00:37:14.866
This will do.

405
00:37:14.866 --> 00:37:18.103
Are you confident you can
find a cure for your condition?

406
00:37:18.103 --> 00:37:21.407
It was to be the
focus of my work in Iping.

407
00:37:21.407 --> 00:37:24.075
But I can do nothing without
my research journals.

408
00:37:25.243 --> 00:37:27.379
The fool who stole my
money took them too.

409
00:37:28.914 --> 00:37:30.549
Without them.
discovering an antidote

410
00:37:30.549 --> 00:37:31.983
involves
trial-and-error mixtures

411
00:37:31.983 --> 00:37:35.921
for over 300.000. maybe
400.000. chemical combinations.

412
00:37:35.921 --> 00:37:37.623
It would take my whole lifetime.

413
00:37:39.057 --> 00:37:41.092
You must tell me how you
achieved this. Griffin.

414
00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:42.694
It's a miracle of science.

415
00:37:44.162 --> 00:37:45.997
If only you had
cared this much about me

416
00:37:45.997 --> 00:37:47.466
during my time at university.

417
00:37:52.804 --> 00:37:55.974
I devoted every shilling I
possessed to my research.

418
00:37:55.974 --> 00:37:57.476
Why invisibility?

419
00:37:57.476 --> 00:37:59.210
Oh. dear Adeline.

420
00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:01.947
I wasn't researching
how to be unseen.

421
00:38:01.947 --> 00:38:03.682
I was researching
how to be free.

422
00:38:05.283 --> 00:38:08.354
My experiments met with
unparalleled success.

423
00:38:08.354 --> 00:38:09.988
but my landlord grew impatient.

424
00:38:09.988 --> 00:38:11.490
I know you're in there!

425
00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:13.291
and I had little
time to conclude my research.

426
00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:14.493
Griffin!

427
00:38:14.493 --> 00:38:16.294
When he came
to collect his rent.

428
00:38:16.294 --> 00:38:17.896
I had no choice.

429
00:38:17.896 --> 00:38:20.832
I put on an act that would
have made any magician proud.

430
00:38:35.614 --> 00:38:37.148
My head was already
teeming with plans

431
00:38:37.148 --> 00:38:39.284
of all the wild and
wonderful things

432
00:38:39.284 --> 00:38:41.387
I now had the freedom
to do with impunity.

433
00:38:42.854 --> 00:38:44.623
But my triumph was short-lived.

434
00:38:46.157 --> 00:38:48.927
I had been a naive fool.

435
00:38:48.927 --> 00:38:51.196
What helpless absurdity
an invisible man is

436
00:38:51.196 --> 00:38:52.598
in the cold climate

437
00:38:52.598 --> 00:38:54.299
and a dirty. crowded city.

438
00:38:55.701 --> 00:38:57.736
Every crossing was a danger.

439
00:38:57.736 --> 00:39:00.305
every pedestrian a
thing to watch alertly.

440
00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:04.275
I had no shelter. no covering
in the coming winter.

441
00:39:05.711 --> 00:39:08.947
and to get clothing was to
forego all my advantage.

442
00:39:08.947 --> 00:39:10.916
Snow was settling upon me.

443
00:39:10.916 --> 00:39:13.151
rain would make me
a watery outline.

444
00:39:13.151 --> 00:39:16.054
a glistening surface of a man.

445
00:39:16.054 --> 00:39:18.390
London fog would turn me
into a ghostly bubble.

446
00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:20.892
more visible than any
ordinary man blurred

447
00:39:20.892 --> 00:39:21.927
and obscured by it.

448
00:39:30.736 --> 00:39:33.839
I stumbled across a
humble costuming shop.

449
00:39:33.839 --> 00:39:36.542
That night after the
store owner had gone home.

450
00:39:36.542 --> 00:39:38.510
I rummaged out a costume

451
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:41.312
and robbed him of any
available money I could find.

452
00:39:43.181 --> 00:39:46.151
Finally. I went
out into the world.

453
00:39:47.318 --> 00:39:50.088
a grotesque but still
credible figure.

454
00:39:52.524 --> 00:39:54.593
I realized invisibility
made it possible

455
00:39:54.593 --> 00:39:56.294
for me to gain wealth and power

456
00:39:57.896 --> 00:40:00.566
but also made it
impossible to enjoy them.

457
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:07.706
I eventually made
my way to Iping.

458
00:40:07.706 --> 00:40:10.408
It was supposed to
be quiet and safe.

459
00:40:10.408 --> 00:40:12.778
I went there to find a
way of restoring myself.

460
00:40:12.778 --> 00:40:14.245
Then.

461
00:40:14.245 --> 00:40:17.082
I was betrayed by the one
man who was supposed to help.

462
00:40:18.383 --> 00:40:19.751
It's remarkable. Griffin.

463
00:40:20.586 --> 00:40:22.153
Remarkable.

464
00:40:22.153 --> 00:40:24.890
They'll have to rewrite
every textbook in the world.

465
00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:26.324
Think of the fortune
you might raise

466
00:40:26.324 --> 00:40:28.527
and the good you
might do with it.

467
00:40:28.527 --> 00:40:31.129
We must think
bigger than that. my dear.

468
00:40:45.811 --> 00:40:47.445
Colonel Adye.

469
00:41:04.896 --> 00:41:06.131
Such a relief

470
00:41:06.131 --> 00:41:08.033
you were able to delay
the bank's foreclosure.

471
00:41:09.234 --> 00:41:11.603
However did you pull
off such a miracle?

472
00:41:11.603 --> 00:41:15.140
My brother in America
sent me the necessary funds.

473
00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:16.842
He's doing quite
well for himself.

474
00:41:17.909 --> 00:41:18.744
Indeed.

475
00:41:21.146 --> 00:41:22.213
Railroads.

476
00:41:22.213 --> 00:41:23.414
Hmm.

477
00:41:23.414 --> 00:41:26.117
Some men have such a
good head for business.

478
00:41:26.117 --> 00:41:27.452
Others.

479
00:41:27.452 --> 00:41:29.454
like your late
husband. for science.

480
00:41:30.556 --> 00:41:32.958
but science hardly
ever pays the bill. eh?

481
00:41:32.958 --> 00:41:35.493
If only the good deeds
paid as well as the bad.

482
00:41:35.493 --> 00:41:37.896
They never do.

483
00:41:37.896 --> 00:41:38.964
do they. Mrs. Kemp?

484
00:41:44.002 --> 00:41:46.838
You brought your husband's
favorite coat out of retirement.

485
00:41:53.478 --> 00:41:55.013
It's been years

486
00:41:55.013 --> 00:41:57.415
since I last saw him walking
through town in this coat.

487
00:41:58.416 --> 00:41:59.885
I was reminiscing.

488
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.435
It seems. perhaps. your
fortunes have changed.

489
00:42:18.837 --> 00:42:20.606
Strange how the world
always gets on just fine.

490
00:42:20.606 --> 00:42:21.439
don't you think?

491
00:42:22.641 --> 00:42:25.110
No matter what tragedies
befall us mere mortals.

492
00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:31.016
The bank's available
cash is stolen.

493
00:42:31.016 --> 00:42:32.751
Fortunately for them.

494
00:42:32.751 --> 00:42:34.686
you were able to pay
them a sizeable fraction

495
00:42:34.686 --> 00:42:36.021
of what you owe.

496
00:42:36.021 --> 00:42:37.488
in cash.

497
00:42:37.488 --> 00:42:39.858
Why exactly are
you here. Colonel?

498
00:42:39.858 --> 00:42:40.692
Did you know

499
00:42:42.127 --> 00:42:44.262
the bank was robbed of twice
the amount you paid them?

500
00:42:45.897 --> 00:42:48.033
I wonder where that
money disappeared to.

501
00:42:48.033 --> 00:42:50.068
Well. perhaps that mysterious
drifter might have answers

502
00:42:50.068 --> 00:42:50.869
for you.

503
00:42:52.503 --> 00:42:53.304
I agree.

504
00:42:54.372 --> 00:42:56.307
That's why I'm
tracking his movements.

505
00:42:56.307 --> 00:43:00.211
Perhaps he can lead my police
to the bank's stolen money.

506
00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:03.248
But apparently.

507
00:43:05.784 --> 00:43:08.319
I'm not the only one
interested in him.

508
00:43:15.526 --> 00:43:17.295
You appear to be
messengering letters

509
00:43:17.295 --> 00:43:20.098
to poor houses all
over the region

510
00:43:20.098 --> 00:43:21.332
in search of the vagrant.

511
00:43:22.333 --> 00:43:23.501
Mr. Thomas Marvel.

512
00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:26.304
How did you come by
his name. Adeline?

513
00:43:26.304 --> 00:43:28.306
How did you get these?

514
00:43:28.306 --> 00:43:30.642
I always alert authorities
around the regions

515
00:43:30.642 --> 00:43:33.111
about persons of interest.

516
00:43:33.979 --> 00:43:36.147
They forwarded me the letters.

517
00:43:36.147 --> 00:43:38.650
They appear little
like your handwriting.

518
00:43:39.584 --> 00:43:41.086
They're mine.

519
00:43:41.086 --> 00:43:42.020
And Mr. Marvel?

520
00:43:43.221 --> 00:43:44.756
Colonel Adye. I
must ask you to leave.

521
00:43:45.857 --> 00:43:46.825
Immediately.

522
00:43:57.368 --> 00:43:59.671
I came as a courtesy to
give you the opportunity

523
00:43:59.671 --> 00:44:00.672
to be frank with me.

524
00:44:01.807 --> 00:44:03.775
I do suspect you're
withholding information.

525
00:44:12.017 --> 00:44:13.685
Please believe me.

526
00:44:13.685 --> 00:44:16.321
these kinds of secrets
never get better with time.

527
00:44:36.374 --> 00:44:38.209
How dare you write
letters in my name.

528
00:44:38.209 --> 00:44:40.578
and how dare you
threaten Colonel Adye!

529
00:45:13.912 --> 00:45:14.980
Thomas Marvel.

530
00:45:36.902 --> 00:45:37.803
Mrs. Kemp.

531
00:45:41.539 --> 00:45:44.242
If Dr. Kemp could see you.
he'd be sick with worry.

532
00:45:47.578 --> 00:45:49.080
I'll be going home now. ma'am.

533
00:45:54.452 --> 00:45:56.822
This letter came in the
afternoon post for you.

534
00:45:58.123 --> 00:45:59.357
It seems urgent. ma'am.

535
00:46:23.348 --> 00:46:25.383
"Dear Mrs. Kemp.

536
00:46:25.383 --> 00:46:27.685
I've received your
letter requesting my aid

537
00:46:27.685 --> 00:46:31.789
to help you locate
an unfortunate man named Thomas Marvel.

538
00:46:34.025 --> 00:46:36.694
Alas. I feel obliged
to inform you

539
00:46:36.694 --> 00:46:39.364
that the local police have
made the same request.

540
00:46:40.565 --> 00:46:43.734
They keep the miserable
man under surveillance.

541
00:46:43.734 --> 00:46:45.736
For what reason.
I cannot divine.

542
00:46:47.205 --> 00:46:50.175
Sadly. I must report to them
the arrival of your letter.

543
00:46:52.343 --> 00:46:55.013
but in honor of our
past works together

544
00:46:55.013 --> 00:46:57.215
helping the laboring classes.

545
00:46:57.215 --> 00:47:00.251
I can report to you that Thomas
Marvel is sheltering here

546
00:47:00.251 --> 00:47:02.353
in our annex.

547
00:47:02.353 --> 00:47:05.356
Your true friend
and devoted servant.

548
00:47:05.356 --> 00:47:08.126
Bishop Oliver White.
East Cliff Abbey."

549
00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:13.798
Mrs. Kemp.

550
00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:18.003
You are too sensible to
venture to this part of town

551
00:47:18.003 --> 00:47:19.737
so close to nightfall.

552
00:47:19.737 --> 00:47:21.306
I must find that man.

553
00:47:21.306 --> 00:47:24.109
You place me in a
difficult position.

554
00:47:24.109 --> 00:47:27.278
especially if you are involved
with anything dishonest.

555
00:47:27.278 --> 00:47:28.379
I do not want to know

556
00:47:28.379 --> 00:47:29.614
about anything that-

557
00:47:29.614 --> 00:47:31.249
Have you informed
Colonel Adye yet?

558
00:47:32.617 --> 00:47:33.885
You know I must.

559
00:47:35.053 --> 00:47:37.355
Port Burdock is
not a large city.

560
00:47:37.355 --> 00:47:38.990
Sooner rather than later.

561
00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:42.327
word will get back to the
police about his presence.

562
00:47:42.327 --> 00:47:45.563
including word about
your inquiries here.

563
00:47:49.968 --> 00:47:53.271
This is the one and only time
I can help you in this manner.

564
00:47:54.539 --> 00:47:56.374
He avoids the other homeless.

565
00:47:56.374 --> 00:47:57.408
find him in the pews.

566
00:48:10.788 --> 00:48:13.258
We have a
mutual acquaintance.

567
00:48:18.263 --> 00:48:19.197
I don't know you.

568
00:48:20.932 --> 00:48:23.534
And I doubt we'd be moving
in the same society.

569
00:48:25.736 --> 00:48:26.571
I'm here alone.

570
00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:35.146
I'm curious to learn why you
think I need that assurance.

571
00:48:36.781 --> 00:48:39.517
For a man of means. you
choose poor accommodations.

572
00:48:43.989 --> 00:48:46.891
A man who spends his money
is one to draw attention.

573
00:48:48.726 --> 00:48:50.595
I ain't making
that mistake again.

574
00:48:52.297 --> 00:48:54.699
You being here is case in point.

575
00:48:58.003 --> 00:48:59.971
If you're his friend.
what do you want?

576
00:49:01.472 --> 00:49:03.108
The truth is. I am his friend.

577
00:49:04.575 --> 00:49:06.444
I just don't know
whether he is mine.

578
00:49:10.115 --> 00:49:11.616
He's a sick man.

579
00:49:13.484 --> 00:49:14.952
Always yammering on

580
00:49:14.952 --> 00:49:18.356
about his plans to bring
the entire country to heel.

581
00:49:18.356 --> 00:49:19.557
The entire country?

582
00:49:20.458 --> 00:49:21.292
Yeah.

583
00:49:23.128 --> 00:49:24.929
But Thomas Marvel showed him.

584
00:49:27.332 --> 00:49:29.367
Queen Victoria should
give me a medal.

585
00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:35.140
I took the wind right
out of his sails. I did.

586
00:49:39.077 --> 00:49:40.611
Could you see
your way to parting

587
00:49:40.611 --> 00:49:42.213
with that journal in your hands?

588
00:49:47.518 --> 00:49:48.486
I knew it.

589
00:49:50.455 --> 00:49:53.658
You just want the power
for yourself. don't you?

590
00:49:53.658 --> 00:49:54.892
Well. it's mine!

591
00:49:54.892 --> 00:49:57.195
You're in league with
the invisible man!

592
00:50:00.131 --> 00:50:02.567
She's in league with
the invisible man!

593
00:50:04.202 --> 00:50:05.703
He's with her now.

594
00:50:09.574 --> 00:50:10.841
Marvel. wait!

595
00:50:28.926 --> 00:50:29.760
Griffin?

596
00:52:19.637 --> 00:52:20.771
Griffin.

597
00:52:22.407 --> 00:52:23.408
Where have you been?

598
00:52:25.142 --> 00:52:27.011
Why did you follow
Colonel Adye into town?

599
00:52:27.011 --> 00:52:28.479
What did you do to him?

600
00:52:28.479 --> 00:52:31.516
Do you actually
care for that insufferable man?

601
00:52:33.651 --> 00:52:36.254
I wanted to see what he
actually knew about us.

602
00:52:37.288 --> 00:52:38.756
No doubt my
confederate had talked

603
00:52:38.756 --> 00:52:40.157
the police chief's ears off

604
00:52:40.157 --> 00:52:42.960
with wild tales of
the invisible man.

605
00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:44.429
I wanted to know

606
00:52:44.429 --> 00:52:45.996
if good. old Colonel Adye
believed the stories.

607
00:52:46.931 --> 00:52:48.165
And?

608
00:52:48.165 --> 00:52:49.767
Well. of
course he doesn't.

609
00:52:52.237 --> 00:52:53.571
Sit down.

610
00:52:58.976 --> 00:53:02.213
Life must go on. my girl.

611
00:53:04.482 --> 00:53:06.384
There is so much for us to do.

612
00:53:08.753 --> 00:53:11.589
Reginald would've never
made so bold a move.

613
00:53:11.589 --> 00:53:13.224
That
was him all over.

614
00:53:14.158 --> 00:53:16.627
And yet. he won what mattered.

615
00:53:18.929 --> 00:53:21.666
Imagine what we could
do together. Adeline.

616
00:53:21.666 --> 00:53:23.834
I know you wish to
do great things.

617
00:53:23.834 --> 00:53:26.437
I can ferret out the hidden
information you need.

618
00:53:27.605 --> 00:53:29.507
secure the funds
that you require.

619
00:53:31.509 --> 00:53:34.345
I can remove the obstacles
that stand in your way.

620
00:53:36.481 --> 00:53:38.649
From this day forward.

621
00:53:38.649 --> 00:53:41.519
life will be so much easier
for you. Adeline Kemp.

622
00:53:43.554 --> 00:53:45.623
But I must have my journals.

623
00:53:46.891 --> 00:53:49.226
Only when I master invisibility
will the world bend

624
00:53:49.226 --> 00:53:50.461
to my will.

625
00:53:50.461 --> 00:53:53.364
Only then can you make
it a better place.

626
00:53:54.932 --> 00:53:56.233
I must have my journals.

627
00:53:56.233 --> 00:53:57.201
Adeline.

628
00:53:57.201 --> 00:53:58.636
and you will help me find them!

629
00:54:17.121 --> 00:54:17.955
Marvel?

630
00:54:28.933 --> 00:54:30.468
Have you seen him?

631
00:54:30.468 --> 00:54:33.604
He didn't make the queue to
shelter in the annex tonight.

632
00:54:33.604 --> 00:54:35.039
but I've seen where he goes

633
00:54:35.039 --> 00:54:36.907
when he wants to
make himself scarce.

634
00:54:37.808 --> 00:54:39.410
I can show you.

635
00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:40.611
but what's in it for me?

636
00:54:54.792 --> 00:54:55.626
Go on.

637
00:54:57.362 --> 00:55:00.197
The entrance to the
tunnel's around there.

638
00:55:44.942 --> 00:55:46.477
Are you lost. love?

639
00:55:54.284 --> 00:55:55.920
Maybe we can light your away.

640
00:56:04.161 --> 00:56:06.597
Michael did a fine
job luring you.

641
00:56:10.935 --> 00:56:13.170
If you've come for your
money. it isn't here!

642
00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:21.045
Mr. Marvel. I'm not
looking for the money.

643
00:56:21.045 --> 00:56:22.580
I only seek the journals.

644
00:56:28.318 --> 00:56:31.756
If you want your books
so bad. come and get 'em!

645
00:56:33.023 --> 00:56:35.593
Don't hide behind
this pretty thing.

646
00:56:35.593 --> 00:56:36.427
He's not here.

647
00:56:38.395 --> 00:56:39.797
I'm willing to pay for it.

648
00:56:42.867 --> 00:56:45.603
I'll wager you'd be
willing to do a lot more

649
00:56:46.804 --> 00:56:49.173
before my boys let you
out of this chamber.

650
00:56:56.413 --> 00:56:58.415
What did he tell
you gentlemen?

651
00:56:58.415 --> 00:57:01.151
That an invisible man would
be coming here tonight?

652
00:57:01.151 --> 00:57:03.387
Surely you didn't believe
such a ludicrous claim.

653
00:57:03.387 --> 00:57:05.623
Marvel here's paying us
quite well to babysit him

654
00:57:05.623 --> 00:57:07.892
and take out his
invisible tormentor.

655
00:57:07.892 --> 00:57:08.826
We believe him daft.

656
00:57:08.826 --> 00:57:10.961
but money's money. right. boys?

657
00:57:14.264 --> 00:57:17.668
Marvel also told us that
a pretty little morsel

658
00:57:17.668 --> 00:57:19.904
would be wandering down
here by her lonesome.

659
00:57:20.838 --> 00:57:21.806
We didn't believe that neither.

660
00:57:21.806 --> 00:57:24.642
but wonder of wonders.

661
00:57:24.642 --> 00:57:25.476
here you are.

662
00:57:27.812 --> 00:57:29.547
ready for the taking.

663
00:57:39.456 --> 00:57:41.692
Takes a bit of effort
to pull the trigger.

664
00:57:41.692 --> 00:57:44.261
I guess your. uh. fingers
aren't in the practice.

665
00:57:45.462 --> 00:57:47.397
You should have cocked
the hammer back first.

666
00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:51.135
I can teach you things.

667
00:57:59.844 --> 00:58:01.345
Look out. you idiots!

668
00:58:21.999 --> 00:58:23.500
Where the hell are you?

669
00:58:25.703 --> 00:58:26.771
Everywhere.

670
00:58:28.138 --> 00:58:30.240
Run. Adeline. Run!

671
00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:36.013
Where are you. you blighter?

672
00:58:39.717 --> 00:58:42.052
Show yourself. you blighter!

673
00:59:25.262 --> 00:59:27.998
Congratulations. Mr. Marvel.

674
00:59:27.998 --> 00:59:29.967
You will get your wish.

675
00:59:29.967 --> 00:59:32.336
You will be locked up
for God knows how long.

676
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:35.339
All you had to do was
be part of a brawl

677
00:59:35.339 --> 00:59:37.074
that saw two men killed.

678
00:59:38.375 --> 00:59:39.409
It weren't me.

679
00:59:41.111 --> 00:59:43.113
It were the invisible man.

680
00:59:45.382 --> 00:59:47.151
You don't believe me. do you?

681
00:59:48.719 --> 00:59:50.988
You should ask your
pretty lady friend.

682
00:59:59.529 --> 01:00:02.967
Make sure you give your pretty
little friend her toy back.

683
01:00:29.393 --> 01:00:32.429
Who killed those two men
we found on the ground?

684
01:00:32.429 --> 01:00:34.464
I don't know what
you're talking about.

685
01:00:47.745 --> 01:00:49.714
Tell me the truth. Adeline.

686
01:00:51.682 --> 01:00:53.450
or as much of it
as you can manage.

687
01:00:55.385 --> 01:00:56.386
Let me help you.

688
01:00:59.690 --> 01:01:01.525
I was trying to
recover that journal.

689
01:01:03.193 --> 01:01:04.294
Marvel stole it.

690
01:01:04.294 --> 01:01:05.963
and someone saved me.

691
01:01:05.963 --> 01:01:06.797
Hmm.

692
01:01:11.001 --> 01:01:12.903
Must be quite a book for
you to risk your life

693
01:01:12.903 --> 01:01:14.038
in such a foolish manner.

694
01:01:14.038 --> 01:01:15.272
and then.

695
01:01:15.272 --> 01:01:16.941
a miraculous savior.

696
01:01:18.909 --> 01:01:21.311
I would love to shake his hand.

697
01:01:21.311 --> 01:01:22.446
What does he look like?

698
01:01:23.781 --> 01:01:24.614
I don't know.

699
01:01:26.583 --> 01:01:28.185
Height?

700
01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:29.019
Weight?

701
01:01:30.821 --> 01:01:32.022
Hair and eye color?

702
01:01:32.022 --> 01:01:33.623
I don't know.

703
01:01:33.623 --> 01:01:35.159
Mrs. Kemp.

704
01:01:35.159 --> 01:01:38.128
the sole reason that I don't
drag you behind bars yourself

705
01:01:38.128 --> 01:01:43.133
is that both you and
Mr. Marvel seem to agree

706
01:01:45.369 --> 01:01:48.705
that someone else created
this night's mayhem.

707
01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:49.740
So please.

708
01:01:51.008 --> 01:01:52.609
be more forthcoming.

709
01:01:54.578 --> 01:01:56.713
Does this journal
truly belong to you?

710
01:01:59.216 --> 01:02:00.617
Does it belong to Mr. Marvel?

711
01:02:05.489 --> 01:02:06.423
Does it belong

712
01:02:07.825 --> 01:02:09.193
to an invisible man?

713
01:02:09.193 --> 01:02:10.527
Don't be absurd.

714
01:02:10.527 --> 01:02:11.628
the journal's mine.

715
01:02:14.131 --> 01:02:14.965
Well. I see.

716
01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:17.768
Ominous headings in English.

717
01:02:17.768 --> 01:02:21.371
clearly written by someone
obsessed with the morbid.

718
01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:24.374
And the rest?

719
01:02:26.010 --> 01:02:27.077
Gibberish.

720
01:02:27.077 --> 01:02:28.745
It's a cipher.
I can't read it.

721
01:02:30.514 --> 01:02:31.515
Neither can I.

722
01:02:32.983 --> 01:02:35.986
There's a fellow down at the
station good with puzzles

723
01:02:37.521 --> 01:02:39.323
who says there's a key.

724
01:02:39.323 --> 01:02:41.725
It seems a seven letter keyword
will unlock this cipher.

725
01:02:41.725 --> 01:02:44.862
but I'd be blowed if I can
think of what it might be.

726
01:02:47.731 --> 01:02:50.234
Mr. Marvel doesn't know the
contents in this journal either.

727
01:02:50.234 --> 01:02:52.837
yet you both claim ownership.

728
01:02:54.038 --> 01:02:56.106
The journal belongs
to my late husband.

729
01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:57.707
As you know. he was a scientist.

730
01:02:59.176 --> 01:03:01.378
His dream was to become a
member of the Royal Society.

731
01:03:02.279 --> 01:03:04.081
It was all he ever wanted.

732
01:03:04.081 --> 01:03:07.918
The Reginald we
know sought to conduct

733
01:03:10.988 --> 01:03:12.322
human experimentation?

734
01:03:15.893 --> 01:03:16.861
This journal

735
01:03:18.462 --> 01:03:19.596
is lunacy.

736
01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:25.469
Yet I'm inclined to believe you.

737
01:03:25.469 --> 01:03:27.537
Seeing how fervently
you've been seeking it.

738
01:03:27.537 --> 01:03:29.840
even to the point of
endangering yourself.

739
01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:37.214
What other reason could
you possibly have?

740
01:03:43.053 --> 01:03:44.654
Of course.

741
01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:47.324
I can't return this
gun. officially.

742
01:03:49.426 --> 01:03:50.460
It's a murder weapon.

743
01:03:53.297 --> 01:03:54.731
Whatever you're caught up in.

744
01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:57.634
try to stay safe.

745
01:07:08.125 --> 01:07:10.026
Good day. Lord Mayor.

746
01:07:12.429 --> 01:07:14.698
Ah. Mrs. Kemp.

747
01:07:14.698 --> 01:07:16.266
Exciting day for you.

748
01:07:18.802 --> 01:07:20.036
Is it true?

749
01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:21.705
The city council will
vote on my proposal

750
01:07:21.705 --> 01:07:22.972
for a more humane asylum?

751
01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:25.309
Well. uh.

752
01:07:25.309 --> 01:07:27.277
not to be impolite about it.

753
01:07:27.277 --> 01:07:30.880
but since Councilor
Wicksteed's unfortunate

754
01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:33.550
and. uh. untimely demise.

755
01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:35.919
the committee work he had
stalled has been voted

756
01:07:35.919 --> 01:07:37.087
to move forward.

757
01:07:37.087 --> 01:07:38.588
That does not mean

758
01:07:38.588 --> 01:07:42.926
that your proposal has the
necessary votes to pass.

759
01:07:42.926 --> 01:07:44.528
Who still opposes?

760
01:07:44.528 --> 01:07:45.962
Surely I can make
them see reason.

761
01:07:45.962 --> 01:07:47.997
My proposal pays for
itself over the long term.

762
01:07:47.997 --> 01:07:50.767
You should attempt
to discuss the matter

763
01:07:50.767 --> 01:07:52.035
with Councilor Hammond.

764
01:07:53.103 --> 01:07:55.839
He leads the opposition
against you now.

765
01:07:55.839 --> 01:07:56.673
Hmm.

766
01:07:56.673 --> 01:07:59.075
But. act with haste.

767
01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:00.777
The city council votes tomorrow.

768
01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:14.591
Congratulations
on the vote.

769
01:08:15.792 --> 01:08:17.060
Oh my God. where
have you been?

770
01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:17.861
I didn't know if you
were dead or alive.

771
01:08:17.861 --> 01:08:19.796
Are you hurt?

772
01:08:19.796 --> 01:08:21.698
I'm no
worse off than usual.

773
01:08:22.866 --> 01:08:24.301
How long have you
been following me?

774
01:08:24.301 --> 01:08:25.835
Secretly.

775
01:08:25.835 --> 01:08:27.070
silently.

776
01:08:27.070 --> 01:08:29.173
I'm a
scientist. Adeline.

777
01:08:29.173 --> 01:08:30.740
an observer by profession.

778
01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:32.242
And what good would
my observations be

779
01:08:32.242 --> 01:08:34.378
if my subjects were
aware of my presence?

780
01:08:34.378 --> 01:08:37.314
Some would call that
a violation of privacy.

781
01:08:37.314 --> 01:08:39.383
Others
would call it necessary.

782
01:08:39.383 --> 01:08:41.485
That letter the
mayor was writing.

783
01:08:41.485 --> 01:08:43.587
it was addressed to
Councilor Hammond.

784
01:08:43.587 --> 01:08:45.589
He was warning the
gentleman about you.

785
01:08:45.589 --> 01:08:46.390
Lies.

786
01:08:47.324 --> 01:08:49.359
I beg your pardon!

787
01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:50.394
Must have been the wind.

788
01:08:50.394 --> 01:08:51.761
The wind? Indoors?

789
01:08:51.761 --> 01:08:53.730
How daft.

790
01:08:53.730 --> 01:08:55.131
You hotheaded fool.

791
01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:56.400
you never did learn to
control that temper. did you?

792
01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:58.168
They aim to
vote down your proposal

793
01:08:58.168 --> 01:09:00.337
after a so-called heroic
effort to pass it.

794
01:09:00.337 --> 01:09:02.506
How many precious years of
your life have you wasted

795
01:09:02.506 --> 01:09:04.140
on this rotting town?

796
01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:07.511
You know the measure of these
men more than I do. I wager.

797
01:09:07.511 --> 01:09:09.145
I'm a woman

798
01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:10.447
in a world of small men.

799
01:09:11.348 --> 01:09:13.583
It was the same at university.

800
01:09:13.583 --> 01:09:16.386
allowed to sit in lectures
but barred from examinations.

801
01:09:17.954 --> 01:09:20.357
I'm only permitted to
act through a limited set of channels.

802
01:09:20.357 --> 01:09:22.292
Then
make me your channel.

803
01:09:22.292 --> 01:09:24.828
and in turn. you
will become mine.

804
01:09:24.828 --> 01:09:26.663
What exactly
are you proposing?

805
01:09:26.663 --> 01:09:28.632
I need the
other two journals.

806
01:09:28.632 --> 01:09:30.200
Help me reach the
police station.

807
01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:31.835
and I'll get your
humble proposal passed

808
01:09:31.835 --> 01:09:32.969
by the city council.

809
01:09:34.338 --> 01:09:36.273
Give me your word
you'll not hurt him.

810
01:09:36.273 --> 01:09:38.107
There'll be no more bloodshed.

811
01:09:39.276 --> 01:09:40.777
Anything
for you. Adeline.

812
01:09:40.777 --> 01:09:42.145
Anything.

813
01:09:42.145 --> 01:09:43.980
The whole world for you.

814
01:10:06.903 --> 01:10:07.737
Mrs. Kemp.

815
01:10:10.507 --> 01:10:12.141
Is there something
I can help you with?

816
01:10:12.141 --> 01:10:13.943
I'd like to talk
to Thomas Marvel.

817
01:10:15.745 --> 01:10:18.415
I fail to see how that
would be productive.

818
01:10:18.415 --> 01:10:20.183
He stole three
journals. not one.

819
01:10:21.351 --> 01:10:23.853
Journals that belong to
my dear late husband.

820
01:10:23.853 --> 01:10:25.221
his final legacy to me.

821
01:10:38.001 --> 01:10:39.636
I'll ask him the questions.

822
01:10:39.636 --> 01:10:40.704
You stay silent.

823
01:10:40.704 --> 01:10:41.505
You understand?

824
01:10:50.046 --> 01:10:51.515
Can't
keep me here. Adye.

825
01:10:51.515 --> 01:10:52.649
it's not safe!

826
01:10:53.783 --> 01:10:54.784
Quiet. Albert!

827
01:11:00.657 --> 01:11:02.826
If he admits to having
two more stolen journals.

828
01:11:02.826 --> 01:11:05.094
I'll try to convince
him to surrender them.

829
01:11:16.506 --> 01:11:18.508
What's she doing here?

830
01:11:19.943 --> 01:11:21.845
The lady claims you have
two more of her journals

831
01:11:21.845 --> 01:11:24.414
in your hidden stash
somewhere around town.

832
01:11:24.414 --> 01:11:26.215
Those journals belong to me.

833
01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:28.352
Mr. Marvel.

834
01:11:29.218 --> 01:11:30.687
how shall I put this?

835
01:11:30.687 --> 01:11:32.422
It doesn't take a
detective to know

836
01:11:32.422 --> 01:11:35.525
that the journals are beyond
a man of your education.

837
01:11:35.525 --> 01:11:36.660
Hmm?

838
01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:38.227
A supposition
bolstered by the fact

839
01:11:38.227 --> 01:11:40.029
you cannot tell me the contents.

840
01:11:40.029 --> 01:11:41.465
Oh. and she can read 'em?

841
01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.535
Mrs. Kemp claims
her late husband.

842
01:11:45.535 --> 01:11:46.903
a scientist. wrote them.

843
01:11:47.937 --> 01:11:49.373
You'll have to forgive me

844
01:11:49.373 --> 01:11:52.409
if I find her version of
events slightly more plausible.

845
01:11:55.579 --> 01:11:57.013
You've killed me. Adye.

846
01:11:58.715 --> 01:12:01.418
You've led the invisible
man right to me.

847
01:12:04.621 --> 01:12:05.989
She's in league with him.

848
01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:07.691
Ask her!

849
01:12:09.292 --> 01:12:13.062
You can tell it. it's written
all over her lying face!

850
01:12:14.097 --> 01:12:14.898
Mrs. Kemp.

851
01:12:16.065 --> 01:12:19.035
would you please try to
explain to Mr. Marvel

852
01:12:19.035 --> 01:12:22.271
that you do not have
an invisible man following you around?

853
01:12:23.407 --> 01:12:24.340
Just give me the journals.

854
01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:26.510
and this can all be over.

855
01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:30.547
If you're so terrified
of this invisible man.

856
01:12:30.547 --> 01:12:31.981
why not give up the journals?

857
01:12:31.981 --> 01:12:33.617
You don't know him like I do!

858
01:12:34.818 --> 01:12:36.052
And I'd wager that
you don't know him

859
01:12:36.052 --> 01:12:38.655
as well as you think
you do either. missy!

860
01:12:40.624 --> 01:12:43.092
Giving him the books back
won't be the end of it.

861
01:12:45.529 --> 01:12:48.264
No. it'll just be the beginning.

862
01:12:49.265 --> 01:12:50.400
for all of us.

863
01:12:51.668 --> 01:12:54.237
Are my ears deceiving me

864
01:12:54.237 --> 01:12:56.906
or did I actually
hear a note of concern

865
01:12:56.906 --> 01:12:58.174
for your fellow man?

866
01:12:58.174 --> 01:13:01.010
It ain't your ears
that be deceiving you.

867
01:13:06.015 --> 01:13:07.216
He won't give them up.

868
01:13:11.721 --> 01:13:13.022
Hey!

869
01:13:13.022 --> 01:13:15.391
Don't leave me here with him!

870
01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:17.093
With whom?

871
01:13:17.093 --> 01:13:18.795
The invisible man?

872
01:13:18.795 --> 01:13:21.030
Oh. invisible man.

873
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:24.067
please stop harassing
this poor. unfortunate.

874
01:13:24.067 --> 01:13:26.603
Blast you. you fool!

875
01:13:26.603 --> 01:13:28.938
You don't know
what you're doing!

876
01:13:28.938 --> 01:13:31.975
Perhaps I should support
your asylum after all.

877
01:13:31.975 --> 01:13:34.410
This is blood on
your hands. Adye!

878
01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:37.113
It's blood on your hands. Adye!

879
01:13:37.113 --> 01:13:39.849
It's blood on your hands!

880
01:14:18.722 --> 01:14:19.923
You're undressed.

881
01:14:19.923 --> 01:14:22.058
I asked you to make
yourself decent.

882
01:14:22.058 --> 01:14:24.360
I'd forgotten
how very lovely you are.

883
01:14:25.929 --> 01:14:27.430
I have them. Adeline.

884
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:29.065
my precious journals.

885
01:14:29.065 --> 01:14:30.900
and I have you to thank for it.

886
01:14:31.935 --> 01:14:33.102
What about Marvel?

887
01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:35.271
He's fine.

888
01:14:36.339 --> 01:14:37.907
Now you'll find a cure.

889
01:14:37.907 --> 01:14:39.408
The cure?

890
01:14:39.408 --> 01:14:41.845
There is no affliction. Adeline.

891
01:14:41.845 --> 01:14:44.247
As you said. my achievements
were remarkable.

892
01:14:44.247 --> 01:14:46.415
that I would rewrite
science as we know it.

893
01:14:47.584 --> 01:14:48.918
You've done a
very great thing.

894
01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:51.487
a great and terrible thing.

895
01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:52.589
but it scares me.

896
01:14:55.892 --> 01:14:57.927
I'm only
just beginning to realize

897
01:14:57.927 --> 01:15:00.730
the extraordinary advantages
invisibility gives me.

898
01:15:02.398 --> 01:15:04.100
But until I find a cure.

899
01:15:05.234 --> 01:15:06.770
I must have a partner.

900
01:15:08.605 --> 01:15:09.873
A partner?

901
01:15:09.873 --> 01:15:11.274
I must have you.

902
01:15:12.642 --> 01:15:15.378
Are you not wary of
being invisible yourself?

903
01:15:15.378 --> 01:15:18.214
Alone in this house.
in your public causes?

904
01:15:19.515 --> 01:15:22.819
Are you not tired of
being a woman unseen.

905
01:15:22.819 --> 01:15:24.554
a voice unheard?

906
01:15:26.656 --> 01:15:30.059
The world will hear both
our voices before too long.

907
01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:24.614
Margaret?

908
01:16:28.451 --> 01:16:30.219
Have you seen Margaret?

909
01:16:30.219 --> 01:16:31.420
No. ma'am.

910
01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:32.588
but I found a note from
her in the kitchen.

911
01:16:32.588 --> 01:16:34.190
She's gone to her
sister's in town there.

912
01:16:34.190 --> 01:16:36.092
she thinks she's coming
down with the flu.

913
01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:36.926
A note?

914
01:16:39.495 --> 01:16:40.396
Thank you. Evie.

915
01:16:41.297 --> 01:16:42.899
Good luck today. Mrs. Kemp.

916
01:16:42.899 --> 01:16:44.233
I'm sorry?

917
01:16:44.233 --> 01:16:45.501
The city council?

918
01:16:45.501 --> 01:16:47.671
I heard they're voting
on your asylum today.

919
01:16:48.838 --> 01:16:50.306
Yes. thank you
for reminding me.

920
01:17:02.819 --> 01:17:05.188
You seem to be in
high spirits today.

921
01:17:05.188 --> 01:17:07.957
It could almost be like we
were at university again.

922
01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:10.994
you and Reginald fussing over
all the beakers and tubes.

923
01:17:10.994 --> 01:17:12.929
every breakthrough a
triumph.

924
01:17:12.929 --> 01:17:14.798
I have every
reason to be happy.

925
01:17:14.798 --> 01:17:16.465
I have my journals back.

926
01:17:16.465 --> 01:17:19.368
and I was finally
able to test a cure.

927
01:17:19.368 --> 01:17:20.670
It had flaws.

928
01:17:20.670 --> 01:17:23.072
Right now. it's more
like a slow poison.

929
01:17:23.072 --> 01:17:24.040
But sooner or later.

930
01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:25.909
a full cure will be mine.

931
01:17:25.909 --> 01:17:29.679
Then my invisibility shall
truly become a tool of power.

932
01:17:31.147 --> 01:17:32.415
I don't understand.

933
01:17:32.415 --> 01:17:33.883
Surely when you
formulate a cure.

934
01:17:33.883 --> 01:17:36.052
you'll just become
visible again. correct?

935
01:17:36.052 --> 01:17:38.087
My invisibility
gives me advantages

936
01:17:38.087 --> 01:17:40.256
too valuable to
simply toss aside.

937
01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:42.892
But with a cure.

938
01:17:42.892 --> 01:17:46.696
both of us can be visible
and invisible at will.

939
01:17:46.696 --> 01:17:48.164
Me invisible?

940
01:17:48.164 --> 01:17:49.098
Perhaps I will share

941
01:17:49.098 --> 01:17:51.134
with you the secrets of my work.

942
01:17:51.134 --> 01:17:53.402
the key word that
unlocks the cipher.

943
01:17:53.402 --> 01:17:54.637
- Griffin. I don't want-
- But this is.

944
01:17:54.637 --> 01:17:57.606
this is day one of year
one of the new epoch.

945
01:17:57.606 --> 01:18:00.009
the epoch of the invisible man!

946
01:18:01.144 --> 01:18:03.747
We'll begin with Port Burdock

947
01:18:03.747 --> 01:18:06.082
and your humble proposal
to the city council.

948
01:18:07.483 --> 01:18:08.985
I almost forgot!

949
01:18:08.985 --> 01:18:12.255
Today. it passes the vote
because I say it passes!

950
01:18:14.891 --> 01:18:15.925
Griffin. wait!

951
01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:38.447
Ah. Mrs. Kemp.

952
01:18:39.648 --> 01:18:41.017
Mayor Edeson. I
must talk to you.

953
01:18:41.017 --> 01:18:43.486
The vote will be held
this afternoon. my dear.

954
01:18:43.486 --> 01:18:44.754
don't fret.

955
01:18:44.754 --> 01:18:46.155
But first. a spot of
luncheon at my club.

956
01:18:46.155 --> 01:18:47.356
No. I. uh-

957
01:18:47.356 --> 01:18:48.858
We're still a little
behind. of course.

958
01:18:48.858 --> 01:18:50.827
but then. I did have the
devil's luck trying to get

959
01:18:50.827 --> 01:18:52.561
into the city this morning.

960
01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:54.463
And then there are. well.

961
01:18:54.463 --> 01:18:57.934
just so many important
votes to get through.

962
01:18:57.934 --> 01:19:00.904
But rest assured. we
will consider your ideas

963
01:19:00.904 --> 01:19:04.473
with the utmost deliberation
and care that they deserve.

964
01:19:04.473 --> 01:19:07.176
Whether the vote goes
in your favor. I-

965
01:19:07.176 --> 01:19:09.012
Perhaps it might
be safer to delay.

966
01:19:10.113 --> 01:19:10.947
Delay?

967
01:19:11.948 --> 01:19:13.149
My dear girl.

968
01:19:13.149 --> 01:19:14.951
you've spent months
hounding the councilors

969
01:19:14.951 --> 01:19:16.719
and now you wish to delay?

970
01:19:16.719 --> 01:19:17.887
You must understand.

971
01:19:17.887 --> 01:19:19.755
the bank and the
money and Wicksteed...

972
01:19:21.057 --> 01:19:22.691
Oh my God. Wicksteed.

973
01:19:23.592 --> 01:19:24.994
Time to clean house.

974
01:19:48.317 --> 01:19:49.853
Two men

975
01:19:49.853 --> 01:19:52.488
who opposed your charitable
proposals have been killed.

976
01:19:52.488 --> 01:19:54.290
including the mayor
of Port Burdock.

977
01:19:58.427 --> 01:20:00.263
I find it

978
01:20:00.263 --> 01:20:03.732
too convenient to
be coincidence.

979
01:20:05.434 --> 01:20:07.303
The bank theft and the dead men.

980
01:20:07.303 --> 01:20:09.005
the men in the tunnels.

981
01:20:11.274 --> 01:20:13.943
Marshal Wicksteed. Mayor Edeson.

982
01:20:15.044 --> 01:20:16.913
And last night.

983
01:20:16.913 --> 01:20:18.081
Thomas Marvel.

984
01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:21.985
Marvel?

985
01:20:30.726 --> 01:20:33.396
We found him like that
just hours after your visit.

986
01:20:35.932 --> 01:20:37.733
What part did you play in this?

987
01:20:38.601 --> 01:20:39.435
Did you

988
01:20:40.536 --> 01:20:42.038
steal a key when you were here?

989
01:20:47.710 --> 01:20:48.777
No. it's worse.

990
01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:52.181
I let him inside.

991
01:20:55.985 --> 01:20:57.520
Does the culprit have a name?

992
01:20:58.687 --> 01:21:01.690
Griffin. His name
is Cade Griffin.

993
01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:03.927
Where is he? What
does he look like?

994
01:21:05.161 --> 01:21:06.229
That's the problem.

995
01:21:13.636 --> 01:21:15.138
The idea is ludicrous.

996
01:21:16.505 --> 01:21:18.674
I want to hear you say it.

997
01:21:18.674 --> 01:21:19.976
Look me in the eye!

998
01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:23.112
Tell me with a straight face

999
01:21:23.112 --> 01:21:25.915
that an invisible man
committed these crimes.

1000
01:21:28.884 --> 01:21:29.718
An invisible man-

1001
01:21:29.718 --> 01:21:31.120
Robbed the bank?

1002
01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:32.055
Yes.

1003
01:21:32.055 --> 01:21:33.422
Murdered Mr. Wicksteed.

1004
01:21:33.422 --> 01:21:35.124
- Yes!
- Killed the mayor.

1005
01:21:35.124 --> 01:21:37.726
tortured Thomas Marvel to death!

1006
01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:42.966
My God. Adeline.

1007
01:21:42.966 --> 01:21:45.068
I don't know what I've
done or what I was doing.

1008
01:21:46.469 --> 01:21:48.237
It was just such a miracle
scientific endeavor.

1009
01:21:48.237 --> 01:21:50.739
Think of what could be
done with such an advance.

1010
01:21:52.942 --> 01:21:54.310
I never thought he would.

1011
01:21:56.079 --> 01:21:57.546
In his younger days. he was...

1012
01:22:00.483 --> 01:22:01.484
Marvel's right.

1013
01:22:03.586 --> 01:22:05.354
He's crazed. and he's dangerous.

1014
01:22:07.490 --> 01:22:08.958
But not invincible.

1015
01:22:09.925 --> 01:22:11.460
It's time you chose a side.

1016
01:23:37.213 --> 01:23:39.648
Oh. dear God.

1017
01:23:58.434 --> 01:23:59.235
Margaret.

1018
01:24:19.655 --> 01:24:22.125
I was finally
able to test a cure.

1019
01:24:23.426 --> 01:24:25.194
It has flaws.

1020
01:24:25.194 --> 01:24:27.596
Right now. it's more
like a slow poison.

1021
01:24:38.974 --> 01:24:39.808
Help.

1022
01:24:41.076 --> 01:24:42.945
He's a madman!

1023
01:24:42.945 --> 01:24:44.046
Oh my God!

1024
01:25:38.534 --> 01:25:41.404
♪ My heart is pierced by Cupid

1025
01:25:41.404 --> 01:25:44.507
♪ I disdain all
glittering gold ♪

1026
01:25:44.507 --> 01:25:48.043
♪ There is nothing
can console me ♪

1027
01:25:48.043 --> 01:25:51.814
♪ But my jolly sailor bold

1028
01:25:51.814 --> 01:25:54.550
♪ Upon one summer's morning

1029
01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:58.287
♪ I carelessly did stray

1030
01:25:58.287 --> 01:25:59.188
Mrs. Kemp?

1031
01:26:01.324 --> 01:26:03.058
I'm so sorry. Evie.

1032
01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:19.141
What's going on?

1033
01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:43.966
I don't understand. ma'am!

1034
01:26:43.966 --> 01:26:45.301
Run. Evie. go!

1035
01:27:16.799 --> 01:27:18.801
Your final
obstacle removed.

1036
01:27:19.735 --> 01:27:21.337
Your proposal will pass.

1037
01:27:21.337 --> 01:27:22.438
Yes. I'll get what I want.

1038
01:27:22.438 --> 01:27:24.106
at the cost of our souls.

1039
01:27:24.106 --> 01:27:27.109
Oh. we are above
man's small. petty morality.

1040
01:27:27.109 --> 01:27:28.744
As Evie knows to her cost.

1041
01:27:28.744 --> 01:27:31.814
A
little fun. nothing more.

1042
01:27:31.814 --> 01:27:34.417
You remain the true
object to my desire.

1043
01:27:36.619 --> 01:27:37.586
And Margaret?

1044
01:27:38.887 --> 01:27:40.255
So you
found Margaret.

1045
01:27:40.255 --> 01:27:41.590
What was left of her.

1046
01:27:44.092 --> 01:27:46.429
She was
nothing. a lab rat.

1047
01:27:46.429 --> 01:27:48.631
You must think bigger. my love.

1048
01:27:48.631 --> 01:27:50.499
The cure draws
closer day by day.

1049
01:27:50.499 --> 01:27:52.067
and with it. our power.

1050
01:27:53.402 --> 01:27:56.204
Griffin. what you
could have been.

1051
01:28:01.477 --> 01:28:03.312
Is that the girl?

1052
01:28:03.312 --> 01:28:05.113
It's just the house settling.

1053
01:28:06.148 --> 01:28:08.317
I want to see.

1054
01:28:13.922 --> 01:28:16.091
Colonel Adye. seize him!

1055
01:28:17.159 --> 01:28:18.461
Adeline.

1056
01:28:18.461 --> 01:28:19.962
You bitch!

1057
01:28:31.006 --> 01:28:33.676
You want her for yourself. Adye.

1058
01:28:33.676 --> 01:28:36.011
I can see right through you.

1059
01:28:47.356 --> 01:28:50.025
Don't let him get away!

1060
01:28:58.501 --> 01:29:00.536
Colonel Adye!

1061
01:29:02.371 --> 01:29:03.372
Stay here.

1062
01:29:08.977 --> 01:29:10.913
He could be anywhere.

1063
01:29:25.661 --> 01:29:26.495
Adye!

1064
01:29:30.599 --> 01:29:33.068
You'll get me
back in that house. Adye.

1065
01:29:34.169 --> 01:29:35.638
You'll get me my journals.

1066
01:29:36.872 --> 01:29:38.240
You're a fool

1067
01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:40.809
if you think she'll
open the door to me now.

1068
01:29:40.809 --> 01:29:43.278
And a bigger fool if you
think I'd put her at risk.

1069
01:29:44.513 --> 01:29:46.849
You think
you could win her heart?

1070
01:29:46.849 --> 01:29:48.584
When she could have me.

1071
01:29:48.584 --> 01:29:50.619
a god among men?

1072
01:29:50.619 --> 01:29:53.021
You may have
blown your chance.

1073
01:29:53.021 --> 01:29:55.257
It seems she
disapproves of murder!

1074
01:30:03.298 --> 01:30:05.133
I want
my journals. Adeline!

1075
01:30:05.133 --> 01:30:06.569
I must have them!

1076
01:30:08.637 --> 01:30:10.506
With my journals. with the cure.

1077
01:30:11.874 --> 01:30:13.942
the reign of the
invisible man will begin!

1078
01:30:36.765 --> 01:30:38.366
I don't want to
hurt you. Griffin.

1079
01:30:38.366 --> 01:30:40.435
Even now. I don't
want to shoot you.

1080
01:30:40.435 --> 01:30:42.471
If you take one single
step inside this room.

1081
01:30:42.471 --> 01:30:44.172
if you don't leave
now and forever.

1082
01:30:44.172 --> 01:30:45.440
I'll burn your damn journals.

1083
01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:47.242
I will
not be stopped.

1084
01:30:47.242 --> 01:30:48.911
Neither will I. not in this.

1085
01:30:48.911 --> 01:30:50.345
If you
destroy my work.

1086
01:30:50.345 --> 01:30:52.581
you'll die here
tonight. Adeline.

1087
01:30:52.581 --> 01:30:54.216
You'll die!

1088
01:30:54.216 --> 01:30:56.084
I don't think it matters.

1089
01:30:56.084 --> 01:30:58.554
I haven't lived
in years!

1090
01:30:59.755 --> 01:31:00.756
No!

1091
01:31:02.057 --> 01:31:04.026
You'll burn. Adeline!

1092
01:31:04.026 --> 01:31:05.227
You'll burn!

1093
01:31:14.369 --> 01:31:16.404
You're mad!
You'll kill us both!

1094
01:31:16.404 --> 01:31:18.707
I would have
been a king. Adeline.

1095
01:31:18.707 --> 01:31:20.543
and you my queen!

1096
01:31:21.476 --> 01:31:24.312
You could have tasted greatness.

1097
01:31:24.312 --> 01:31:25.681
Greatness!

1098
01:31:25.681 --> 01:31:27.916
Instead of the mediocrity
you settled for.

1099
01:31:28.984 --> 01:31:30.452
For Reginald!

1100
01:31:30.452 --> 01:31:33.455
Reginald with his small
thinking and his cowardice.

1101
01:31:33.455 --> 01:31:35.891
With his decency
and his gentleness!

1102
01:31:35.891 --> 01:31:38.561
He was half
the scientist I was!

1103
01:31:41.630 --> 01:31:43.131
But twice the man!

1104
01:31:52.374 --> 01:31:54.677
Adeline!

1105
01:32:34.482 --> 01:32:36.018
Adeline!

1106
01:32:49.464 --> 01:32:52.134
What we could have
done together.

1107
01:32:52.134 --> 01:32:53.501
Terrible things.

1108
01:32:53.501 --> 01:32:54.937
Wonderful things!

1109
01:32:54.937 --> 01:32:56.471
Every door open to us.

1110
01:32:56.471 --> 01:32:59.341
every luxury ours
for the taking.

1111
01:32:59.341 --> 01:33:01.576
every enemy crushed.

1112
01:33:01.576 --> 01:33:03.345
Theft and murder.

1113
01:33:03.345 --> 01:33:05.681
There
is no murder in war.

1114
01:33:05.681 --> 01:33:07.115
War. Adeline.

1115
01:33:07.115 --> 01:33:09.852
An army of invisible
men at my command.

1116
01:33:09.852 --> 01:33:11.687
The world on its knees.

1117
01:33:11.687 --> 01:33:13.288
It's what we wanted.

1118
01:33:14.289 --> 01:33:15.490
No.

1119
01:33:15.490 --> 01:33:16.324
Never that.

1120
01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:20.328
I was in awe of your power.
Griffin. your discovery.

1121
01:33:20.328 --> 01:33:22.364
but it's made you a monster.

1122
01:33:22.364 --> 01:33:25.000
It's made me a king.

1123
01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:26.034
A king!

1124
01:33:52.661 --> 01:33:53.495
Griffin.

1125
01:33:59.201 --> 01:34:00.002
There you are.

1126
01:34:00.903 --> 01:34:01.737
Adeline.

1127
01:34:06.274 --> 01:34:08.677
What a waste it would've been

1128
01:34:09.745 --> 01:34:13.615
for such beauty to be invisible.

1129
01:34:16.985 --> 01:34:17.820
Adeline.

1130
01:34:19.221 --> 01:34:20.455
Always Adeline.

1131
01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:23.325
My love.

1132
01:34:25.293 --> 01:34:26.128
My muse.

1133
01:34:32.034 --> 01:34:33.035
My codeword.

1134
01:34:36.071 --> 01:34:36.905
My key.

1135
01:34:40.075 --> 01:34:40.909
Adeline.

1136
01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:18.847
Is it over?

1137
01:35:20.215 --> 01:35:21.216
It's over.

1138
01:35:22.484 --> 01:35:24.586
I should have left
it to you all along.

1139
01:35:28.023 --> 01:35:30.158
It was all for you. you know.

1140
01:35:30.158 --> 01:35:31.994
He did it all for you.

1141
01:35:34.562 --> 01:35:36.364
In the beginning. perhaps.

1142
01:35:36.364 --> 01:35:37.766
before power corrupted.

1143
01:35:39.968 --> 01:35:42.104
It was in the wrong
hands. I suppose.

1144
01:35:43.371 --> 01:35:44.840
Can't say I blame him.

1145
01:35:46.341 --> 01:35:47.409
Well. not entirely.

1146
01:35:49.711 --> 01:35:50.946
I suppose. in a way.

1147
01:35:53.648 --> 01:35:55.350
we were both after
the same thing.

1148
01:36:37.159 --> 01:36:37.993
Adeline?

1149
01:36:45.934 --> 01:36:47.169
Adeline.
