5
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.230
- He's just in one of his moods.

6
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.230
You know how he gets. It's not that bad.

7
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.500
Look. I'm not making excuses.

8
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.200
You just don't know him like I do.

9
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.770
Well. we all can't be like you and Alex.

10
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:40.762
you know that. right?

11
00:00:40.762 --> 00:00:42.294
(door thudding)

12
00:00:42.294 --> 00:00:43.870
- What's going on here?

13
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:44.815
- [Piper] I gotta go.

14
00:00:44.815 --> 00:00:48.060
- Who you talking to? Is that Alex?

15
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.050
- (sighs) He's with
Taylor. What's your deal?

16
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.883
- My deal is.

17
00:00:52.642 --> 00:00:55.073
(Piper moans)

18
00:00:55.073 --> 00:00:56.770
- Leave me alone.

19
00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.150
- [Milo] You're my girl. Piper.

20
00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.290
- You're drunk.

21
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.347
- Damn right I am.

22
00:01:00.347 --> 00:01:01.379
(Piper grunts)

23
00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.046

(hand smacking)
(Piper grunts)

27
00:01:09.762 --> 00:01:13.345
(gentle melancholy music)

28
00:01:14.203 --> 00:01:16.893
- What? I ran into a door.

29
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.410
I fell down some stairs.

30
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.360
You know how clumsy I can be.

31
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.450
- This is not okay.

32
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.890
- It's fine.

33
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.110
- Our definitions of fine are
not even remotely the same.

34
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.730
- What do you want me to say. Taylor?

35
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.570
- Say that you're leaving him.

36
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.770
Say that you're gonna get some help.

37
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.240
Say that you kicked him in the damn balls.

38
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.259
Just say something.

39
00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:37.390
- He was drunk.

40
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.562
- He's always drunk.

41
00:01:38.562 --> 00:01:39.395
- Shh!

42
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.170
- One day. you're gonna
end up in the hospital.

43
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.420
- I'll be fine.

44
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.783
- There's that word again.

45
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.720
What are your plans?

46
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.670
- What are you talking about?

47
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.080
- Listen. I know he
seemed like a nice guy.

48
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.070
They all do.

49
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.220
- (sighs) I don't need you
butting into my business.

50
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.527
- That's what friends are for.

51
00:02:01.527 --> 00:02:02.930
- If that's what friends are for.

52
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.210
then I don't think I need any.

53
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.760
- I'm just trying to help you.

54
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.860
- [Piper] Well. don't.

55
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.600
- I just want you to be happy.

56
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.433
- I am happy.

57
00:02:11.433 --> 00:02:13.523
Can we talk about something else. please?

58
00:02:14.851 --> 00:02:17.810
(gentle music)

59
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.480
If you don't stop looking at me like that.

60
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.893
we're gonna have a problem.

61
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.079
- I know this really great therapist-

62
00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:28.243
- Not another word.

63
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.480
- [Alex] Hey. guys.

64
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.600
Can I offer you pretty ladies a ride home?

65
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.900
- Hey. Alex.

66
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.243
- Hey. Piper. New look?

67
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.270
- Come on. we'll give you a ride.

68
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.103
- Think I'll walk.

69
00:02:40.103 --> 00:02:40.936
- Are you sure?

70
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.213
At least use that diary I got you.

71
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.470
And please speak to someone.

72
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.480
- I just talked to you.
We had a gay old time.

73
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.850
- That's not what I mean. (chuckles)

74
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:55.683
- I will.

75
00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.530
- [Taylor] Everything's
gonna be all right.

76
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.363
- Yeah.

77
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:05.803
Bye. guys.

78
00:03:28.883 --> 00:03:30.180
(Piper chuckles)

79
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.226
Look!

80
00:03:31.226 --> 00:03:32.374
- [Milo] Trying to watch my show.

81
00:03:32.374 --> 00:03:33.207
- Look!

82
00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:35.953
- (chuckles) Nursing school?

83
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.280
- That's what I've always wanted.

84
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.867
- [Milo] We can't afford it.

85
00:03:42.482 --> 00:03:45.343
- Well. I've been saving up.

86
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.950
- You mean to tell me we've got a shit ton

87
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.650
of bills and you've got extra money.

88
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.853
- It's for school.

89
00:03:51.853 --> 00:03:54.030
(hand smacks)
(Piper gasps)

90
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.043
Where are you going?

91
00:03:55.043 --> 00:03:55.876
- [Milo] Out!

92
00:03:55.876 --> 00:03:56.860
(tense music)

93
00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.442
(Piper crying)

94
00:04:05.562 --> 00:04:08.228
(phone ringing)

95
00:04:21.635 --> 00:04:24.718
(gentle tense music)

96
00:04:40.122 --> 00:04:41.622
- What's all this?

97
00:04:42.537 --> 00:04:43.466
- I've been doing some thinking.

98
00:04:43.466 --> 00:04:45.466
and. uh. you deserve it.

99
00:04:46.707 --> 00:04:48.280
- I don't understand.

100
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.330
- I gave up drinking.

101
00:04:50.318 --> 00:04:51.770
- You what?

102
00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.626
- I'm tired of not being
the man that you deserve.

103
00:04:54.626 --> 00:04:56.110
- You didn't have to do all this for me.

104
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.409
- You're my everything.

105
00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:59.670
I've realized the error of my ways.

106
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.070
and. um. I'm ready to
start making things right.

107
00:05:03.396 --> 00:05:04.738
(Piper gasps)

108
00:05:04.738 --> 00:05:06.043
- Baby?

109
00:05:06.043 --> 00:05:09.713
- Using that baby shit.
Take off your clothes.

110
00:05:09.713 --> 00:05:10.703
- [Piper] Milo!

111
00:05:10.703 --> 00:05:12.536
- [Milo] Do I stutter?

112
00:05:13.537 --> 00:05:15.296
(Piper grunts)

113
00:05:15.296 --> 00:05:16.379
- Go to hell!

114
00:05:17.221 --> 00:05:18.054
- What's your problem.

115
00:05:18.054 --> 00:05:19.550
- Can we just talk for a minute?

116
00:05:20.443 --> 00:05:23.443
(Milo sighs)

117
00:05:23.443 --> 00:05:24.970
- [Milo] The fuck is this?

118
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:25.803
- Wait.

119
00:05:25.803 --> 00:05:27.225
- All the dirty things
you want to do to me.

120
00:05:27.225 --> 00:05:30.725
(tense suspenseful music)

121
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.220
- Baby.

122
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.038
(Milo breathes heavily)

123
00:05:35.038 --> 00:05:35.871
- [Milo] Fuck!

124
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.995
- What are you doing? What are you doing?

125
00:05:39.995 --> 00:05:42.209
(Milo breathes heavily)

126
00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:44.380
Babe. please don't do this.

127
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.430
Put it down.

128
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:46.390
- No.
- Let's talk.

129
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.480
- No!

130
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.234
- Talk! Please don't do this!

131
00:05:49.234 --> 00:05:52.502
Well. set's have sex!
Isn't that what you wanted?

132
00:05:52.502 --> 00:05:54.228
No. please don't do this. don't! Stop!

133
00:05:54.228 --> 00:05:56.081
I'll do anything you want!

134
00:05:56.081 --> 00:05:58.914
(monitor beeping)

135
00:06:02.132 --> 00:06:04.799
(Piper gasping)

136
00:06:06.253 --> 00:06:09.003
(Piper grunting)

137
00:06:19.481 --> 00:06:22.064
(Piper crying)

138
00:07:21.356 --> 00:07:24.270
(Piper sniffles)

139
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.353
(Piper softly gasps)

140
00:07:37.991 --> 00:07:40.020
- Fell down some stairs.

141
00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.172
- I don't know. I just.

142
00:07:41.172 --> 00:07:42.823
- This is not okay.

143
00:07:42.823 --> 00:07:44.183
- It's fine.
- Say it's my boss.

144
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.963
- Do I sound like a
creeper (speaks faintly)?

145
00:07:50.963 --> 00:07:54.144
(woman speaking faintly)

146
00:07:54.144 --> 00:07:57.450
- [Piper] Hi. I'm Piper. Is this?

147
00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.120
- You're in the right place.

148
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.023
- Take a seat.

149
00:08:01.584 --> 00:08:02.890
(lively music)

150
00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:05.890
- So. uh. how does this work?

151
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:09.283
I mean. hopefully it's not
just about me since I'm new.

152
00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:14.467
- Well. it's like AA. but we can drink.

153
00:08:14.467 --> 00:08:16.190
(Piper chuckles)

154
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:17.300
- I'm Tori.

155
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:18.510
- Piper.

156
00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:19.343
- I'm Caitlyn.

157
00:08:20.339 --> 00:08:21.400
- Veronica.

158
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.270
- Kip.
- Nice to meet you guys.

159
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:24.663
- So what's your story?

160
00:08:25.748 --> 00:08:28.163
- Oh. I haven't even had my coffee yet.

161
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.690
- [Caitlyn] Don't forget to sign in.

162
00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:37.870
- [Piper] So how long have all
of you guys been coming here?

163
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.620
- [Caitlyn] Some of us
have been here for months.

164
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.280
Some nearly a year.

165
00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.559
- Is it always this small?

166
00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:45.010
- Girls come and go.

167
00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:48.473
Some get better and some get bitter.

168
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.960
- I didn't think it was like that.

169
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.290
- This isn't a pity party.

170
00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:55.070
We're here to help each other out.

171
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:56.820
Isn't that right. ladies?

172
00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:58.270
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

173
00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:59.850
- So what are you in for?

174
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.190
Wait. let me guess.

175
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:05.290
Your dad. no. your uncle.

176
00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:06.531
- [Piper] Ew. no.

177
00:09:06.531 --> 00:09:08.500
- [Kip] There are all kinds
of sickos out there. baby.

178
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.160
- (sighs) Give her a break. Kip.

179
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.240
- Hey. she's in here for a
reason. same as the rest of us.

180
00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.430
- Yeah. so why are you here?

181
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.487
- My boyfriend.

182
00:09:20.579 --> 00:09:22.680
- (sighs) Why should
they get away with it?

183
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.670
- I was love to see
James put six feet under.

184
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:26.670
- Who?

185
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:27.590
- My brother.

186
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:29.027
- Your brother?
- Yeah. so?

187
00:09:29.995 --> 00:09:33.280
- You guys. with all the CSI. DNA.

188
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.010
cameras on every corner. cell phones.

189
00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:40.277
there's no way we could get away

190
00:09:40.277 --> 00:09:42.130
with something like that. you guys.

191
00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:44.160
- There are ways around stuff like that.

192
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.807
- Yeah. like killing again.

193
00:09:45.807 --> 00:09:47.460
- That would never work.

194
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.363
- So what do you guys usually do here?

195
00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:53.100
- We make video diaries.

196
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.390
- What do you mean?

197
00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:57.003
- Like. we share our story
with the whole world.

198
00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.690
- Why would I wanna do that?

199
00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:01.330
- Because they're helpful.

200
00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:02.910
- It's therapeutic.

201
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:04.910
- It's a waste of time.

202
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:06.640
- What happens if people see our videos

203
00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.020
and it helps them get out
of a abusive relationship?

204
00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.783
- Who cares? Let's get revenge.

205
00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.113
- Thanks for the coffee.
guys. Um. I got to go.

206
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:18.743
- What's her problem?

207
00:10:30.217 --> 00:10:32.217
- Hey. It was all right.

208
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.693
It wasn't what I expected.

209
00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.663
No. I don't. I don't
think I'll be going back.

210
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.430
It just wasn't for me.

211
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:44.533
I. I really don't wanna get into it.

212
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:47.790
Someone's pushy tonight.

213
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:52.793
I know. I know you do.

214
00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:56.533
What time?

215
00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:01.083
Well. I'll be there. Night.

216
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:06.758
- [Milo] What the hell are you doing?

217
00:11:06.758 --> 00:11:07.591
- What?

218
00:11:10.392 --> 00:11:13.142
(Piper grunting)

219
00:11:17.985 --> 00:11:20.485
(Milo grunts)

220
00:11:21.361 --> 00:11:23.861
(Milo grunts)

221
00:11:27.568 --> 00:11:30.151
(Piper grunts)

222
00:11:32.055 --> 00:11:34.722
(Piper gasping)

223
00:11:38.446 --> 00:11:39.779
- I had no idea.

224
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:43.353
- He's gone. I don't know where he is.

225
00:11:45.043 --> 00:11:46.770
- Have you tried the police?

226
00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:48.170
- They couldn't find him.

227
00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:49.530
- Isn't that their job?

228
00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.980
- A manhunt? I guess not.

229
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.263
- This is not okay.

230
00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:56.780
- You want me to see what I can dig up?

231
00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:00.783
- Thanks. guys. but I have to move on.

232
00:12:02.844 --> 00:12:04.654
- I don't know.

233
00:12:04.654 --> 00:12:07.058
- You don't know what?

234
00:12:07.058 --> 00:12:09.580
- I just don't want you
doing anything stupid.

235
00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.284
- [Piper] Like what?

236
00:12:11.284 --> 00:12:14.420
(Taylor sighs)

237
00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.190
- It's gonna be all right.

238
00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:17.319
- Yeah.

239
00:12:17.319 --> 00:12:19.986
(lively music)

240
00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:23.430
Was it something I said?

241
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.070
- Didn't expect to see you again.

242
00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:26.713
- I called you twice.

243
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.150
- That was you?

244
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:30.493
- We're a close group!

245
00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.993
- You bitches started without me?

246
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:38.923
Who's the new?

247
00:12:39.879 --> 00:12:43.100
- I'm Piper. Nice to meet you.

248
00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.173
- That's Harley.

249
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:47.680
- Well. since I'm new.

250
00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.603
I guess I should tell you
a little bit about myself.

251
00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:52.910
- We were talking about putting

252
00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:54.563
some pricks in an early grave.

253
00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:57.163
- That's right.

254
00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:02.430
Well. how long has it been for you

255
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.320
since the whole thing?

256
00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.233
- Not long enough.

257
00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:08.580
- Guys only want two things.

258
00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.050
and they're right here.

259
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:11.883
That's it.

260
00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.000
- We're all here for the same reasons.

261
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.090
The people who we trusted
took advantage of us.

262
00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:22.103
- Yeah. the He-Man. Woman-Hater whatever.

263
00:13:23.277 --> 00:13:25.777
"Little Rascals"? Come on. guys!

264
00:13:25.777 --> 00:13:27.990
- "Little Rascals" aside. I for one

265
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.610
am sick and tired of
watching more girls get beat.

266
00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:32.828
I am so sick and tired as more girls

267
00:13:32.828 --> 00:13:34.700
come through that door with sob stories

268
00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.173
about how helpless they feel.

269
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:38.980
- Me. too.

270
00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.773
- I don't know about this.

271
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:43.853
- He put you in the hospital.

272
00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.063
- She's right. It's sick.

273
00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:50.150
- I help people. I don't...

274
00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:52.293
- [Milo] Fuck!

275
00:13:56.030 --> 00:14:00.343
- These girls are my closest
friends. and now. so are you.

276
00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.623
- Well. damn. I'm in.

277
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:06.293
- You know I'm in.

278
00:14:07.521 --> 00:14:08.938
- I need a drink.

279
00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:12.763
- We can't do this without you.

280
00:14:14.406 --> 00:14:15.239
What do you say?

281
00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:19.010
- How are we gonna get away with it?

282
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:22.923
This is Piper Renee.

283
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:27.563
Um. I don't really know
how all of this works.

284
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:30.923
I was in a bad relationship.

285
00:14:32.896 --> 00:14:34.870
It. it wasn't all bad.

286
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:38.313
He just couldn't keep
it together. I guess.

287
00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:42.363
This is stupid.

288
00:14:43.493 --> 00:14:47.020
- My name's Kip. and I
was taken advantage of

289
00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.870
by someone really close to me.

290
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:52.660
And I don't even what I'm doing.

291
00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:55.163
- This (chuckles) is too hard.

292
00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.433
- This is Caitlyn Ross.

293
00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.680
To whomever is watching this video.

294
00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.800
I hope you learn from my mistakes.

295
00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.193
I don't want you to end
up doing what I did.

296
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:11.793
What makes him think he's better than me?

297
00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:19.820
- Hi. my name is Rhonda and I...

298
00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.463
No. no.

299
00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.593
Hi. my name is Tori.

300
00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:31.993
He hurt me.

301
00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.133
He hurt me more than words can say.

302
00:15:39.463 --> 00:15:40.853
and I'm ashamed.

303
00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:47.620
I'm ashamed that I let him
make me feel like this.

304
00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:56.687
I empowered him. and he took.

305
00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.162
and he took advantage of me.

306
00:16:02.162 --> 00:16:02.995
(wind whistling)

307
00:16:02.995 --> 00:16:05.995
(thunder rumbling)

308
00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.060
- [Caitlyn] My dad used to be a painter.

309
00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.160
He's got like a shit ton of painter suits.

310
00:16:20.628 --> 00:16:23.360
Hello.

311
00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.193
So shit.

312
00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:31.310
Guys. we're gonna. like. wear these

313
00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:33.280
while we. you know.

314
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.790
That way we don't get anything on us.

315
00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:38.193
- Scandalous. (chuckles)

316
00:16:38.193 --> 00:16:39.630
(lively music)

317
00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:40.803
- Something's missing.

318
00:16:42.373 --> 00:16:44.040
- [Crew Member] Cut.

319
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:48.483
- So how is this gonna work?

320
00:16:50.047 --> 00:16:51.360
- [Harley] Diesel is mine.

321
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.283
- Kill your own man. I like it!

322
00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:57.317
- Jesse's gonna pay for what he did to me.

323
00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.290
- Remember the last time I let him pitch.

324
00:17:02.461 --> 00:17:05.130
(Tori speaks faintly)

325
00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:06.406
Empowered. you know?

326
00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:10.252
You know. he told me he loved me.

327
00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:15.262
That's not love. That's not love.

328
00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.656
- Looks like Tori's first.

329
00:17:18.656 --> 00:17:19.960
- I mean. we can't all go.

330
00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.240
- She's right. you guys.
We have to go in twos.

331
00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.290
Who's going with you?

332
00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:26.223
- Let's get this bastard.

333
00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:31.044
- And girls. record everything.

334
00:17:31.044 --> 00:17:32.794
- All right.
- Mm-hmm.

335
00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:39.680
(fists thudding)

336
00:17:41.786 --> 00:17:44.660
- What the hell do you want?

337
00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:47.080
- Sit down! You're making me nervous.

338
00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.950
- What if it doesn't work?
What if we can't do this?

339
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:51.060
- It'll work.

340
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.630
- [Piper] How can you be so sure?

341
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:54.240
- Have you met Ethan?

342
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.300
- [Piper] No.

343
00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.600
- I'm sure they can
handle one stupid redneck.

344
00:17:59.028 --> 00:18:01.380
- Do you wanna play? You
come back to play smurf?

345
00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.311
What's she doing in my house?

346
00:18:02.311 --> 00:18:05.644
- [Tori] What do you think. Ethan? Same.

347
00:18:06.582 --> 00:18:07.984
- Oh my goodness.

348
00:18:07.984 --> 00:18:08.817
- Get off me.

349
00:18:08.817 --> 00:18:11.567
(Ethan grunting)

350
00:18:15.325 --> 00:18:17.992
(Ethan choking)

351
00:18:22.766 --> 00:18:25.266
- [Harley] So how do you feel?

352
00:18:27.131 --> 00:18:27.964
- Better.

353
00:18:38.889 --> 00:18:40.960
(lively music)

354
00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.943
- What are we gonna do with the body?

355
00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.350
- My dad's freezer. It'll hold him.

356
00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:49.500
It'll hold all of them.

357
00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:52.530
- What about the video?

358
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:53.860
- What about it?

359
00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:55.980
- Aren't you afraid it might leak?

360
00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.223
- Now I am!

361
00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:59.190
- It's gonna be fine.

362
00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:00.590
- Well. how can you be sure?

363
00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:04.340
- The only thing that matters is that

364
00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:06.380
he will never hurt you.

365
00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:07.213
- [Tori] Yeah.

366
00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:09.763
- Mine's next.

367
00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:16.460
- Okay. She can go next.
but she's going with you.

368
00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:17.310
- Me?

369
00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:18.877
- [Tori] You can do it.

370
00:19:18.877 --> 00:19:22.693
- I'm not ready to kill
anyone. I mean. and your ex?

371
00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:25.590
- [Harley] It's time
to switch to unleaded.

372
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:28.670
Diesel has got to go!

373
00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:31.323
- Welcome to revenge therapy.

374
00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:35.940
and girls. don't forget
your video diaries.

375
00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:38.363
We have to show the world
what they did to us.

376
00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:40.480
You too.

377
00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.753
- Oh. I don't know.

378
00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:44.307
- It'll make you feel better.

379
00:19:45.499 --> 00:19:46.582
- Yeah. okay.

380
00:19:49.697 --> 00:19:52.470
- (laughs) Sounds like someone's

381
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:54.163
been burning the midnight oil.

382
00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.910
Sure it is. Is it?

383
00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:00.040
Um. well. that's not important right now

384
00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.810
because while you were busy
sleeping your life away.

385
00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:05.547
Alex and I are getting married!

386
00:20:05.547 --> 00:20:08.380
(Taylor laughing)

387
00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.385
Did you hear what I said?

388
00:20:10.385 --> 00:20:12.880
(Piper yells)

389
00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.283
I'm worried about you. Piper!

390
00:20:17.375 --> 00:20:18.208
Pip!

391
00:20:21.798 --> 00:20:26.340
- (sighs) You can only
imagine what just happened.

392
00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:28.620
It's. it's like better than sex.

393
00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:31.160
It's. oh my god. it's crazy.

394
00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.633
it's. it's amazing. it's like.

395
00:20:35.561 --> 00:20:40.561
oh. wow. if I could only
show or say what I've done.

396
00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:45.590
what. what happened. I
can't wait for my turn.

397
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:50.132
Diesel. (laughing) I'm coming for you.

398
00:20:50.132 --> 00:20:52.850
(Harley laughing)

399
00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:57.540
- I did something that I
never would've done before.

400
00:20:59.813 --> 00:21:01.573
I stood up for myself.

401
00:21:03.711 --> 00:21:05.363
I took my control back.

402
00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:11.323
He'll never be able to hurt me again.

403
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:18.353
I know what I did was right. I did right.

404
00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:23.727
- I. uh. I.

405
00:21:28.163 --> 00:21:29.508
I. I can't.

406
00:21:29.508 --> 00:21:31.843
- (sighs) Something happened.

407
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:36.310
we're not gonna take
this lying down anymore.

408
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:39.130
We took a stand for women everywhere.

409
00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:41.600
Everyone needs to know what happened.

410
00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.743
but it's too soon.

411
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:45.523
We're not gonna take this anymore.

412
00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:50.293
We're gonna fight back.
and now that Ethan's gone.

413
00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.793
the Slasher Sisters are born.

414
00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:57.610
- This is Kip again.

415
00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:00.050
Caitlyn's making me do this stupid thing.

416
00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:03.593
They say it gets easier with
time. but that's bullshit.

417
00:22:10.277 --> 00:22:11.656
(Kip laughs)

418
00:22:11.656 --> 00:22:14.538
(lively music)

419
00:22:14.538 --> 00:22:16.010
- You ready?

420
00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:17.984
- I'm just filming. right?

421
00:22:17.984 --> 00:22:19.600
- This time.

422
00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.330
- What do you mean this time?

423
00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:23.190
- Everybody gets a turn.

424
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:25.100
- [Piper] All right. so what's the plan?

425
00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.693
- He's at the local
watering hole every night.

426
00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:30.773
- All right.

427
00:22:36.026 --> 00:22:37.389
♪ Why don't you just say ♪

428
00:22:37.389 --> 00:22:40.972
(vocalist singing faintly)

429
00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:08.643
(upbeat music)

430
00:23:10.066 --> 00:23:13.566
(tense suspenseful music)

431
00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:23.885
- [Crew Member] All right. sound please.

432
00:23:23.885 --> 00:23:24.718
- [Crew Member] Hold on a second.

433
00:23:24.718 --> 00:23:25.551
- [Crew Member] Yep.

434
00:23:25.551 --> 00:23:27.473
- [Crew Member] Sound rolling.

435
00:23:27.473 --> 00:23:29.390
- [Crew Member] Action!

436
00:23:36.532 --> 00:23:39.032
- [Crew Member] The line. Tom.

437
00:23:42.026 --> 00:23:45.443
- [Crew Member] Don't. I'm ready to roll.

438
00:24:01.723 --> 00:24:03.450
- Dam. baby. some of
these are kind of good.

439
00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:05.913
- Ooh! I really liked those.

440
00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:09.400
Love that one.

441
00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:12.120
That. wait. who the fuck is that?

442
00:24:14.055 --> 00:24:14.888
- That?

443
00:24:14.888 --> 00:24:16.057
- Who is that?

444
00:24:16.057 --> 00:24:18.424
- Oh. it's nothing. We
were just taking pictures.

445
00:24:18.424 --> 00:24:19.257
- Pictures like that?

446
00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:21.053
- Yeah. I take them

447
00:24:21.053 --> 00:24:23.085
with you all the time.
- Pictures like that?

448
00:24:23.085 --> 00:24:24.651
Who is that?

449
00:24:24.651 --> 00:24:25.720
- It's a chick from your work.

450
00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.580
- Oh. so one of my friends?

451
00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:29.173
- You're a stripper!

452
00:24:29.173 --> 00:24:30.269
- One of my friends?

453
00:24:30.269 --> 00:24:32.054
(dramatic music)

454
00:24:32.054 --> 00:24:32.887
You're gonna take pictures-

455
00:24:32.887 --> 00:24:35.187
(Harley grunts)

456
00:24:35.187 --> 00:24:38.685
(Harley sniffles)

457
00:24:38.685 --> 00:24:39.892
(Diesel grunts)

458
00:24:39.892 --> 00:24:40.725
(blood gushing)

459
00:24:40.725 --> 00:24:42.029
(lively music)

460
00:24:42.029 --> 00:24:44.123
- [Diesel] (grunts) What the fuck?

461
00:24:45.515 --> 00:24:48.348
(Diesel grunting)

462
00:24:51.462 --> 00:24:52.811
(Piper chuckles)

463
00:24:52.811 --> 00:24:54.200
- I can't believe we did it.

464
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.166
You did it.

465
00:24:55.166 --> 00:24:55.999
(Harley laughs)

466
00:24:55.999 --> 00:24:56.910
- You're home early.

467
00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:58.740
- [Harley] What are you thinking?

468
00:24:58.740 --> 00:24:59.840
- Double feature.

469
00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.930
(Harley and Tori laughing)

470
00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:05.653
- Everybody's doing great. I
want you guys to know that.

471
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:23.943
- Where there is love.
there can be no darkness.

472
00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:29.460
I'm Jesse.

473
00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:30.293
- Caitlyn.

474
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:35.263
- Lovers' hearts linked together
will always beat as one.

475
00:25:38.665 --> 00:25:40.243
Would you wanna go on a walk with me?

476
00:25:43.586 --> 00:25:46.681
(both laughing)

477
00:25:46.681 --> 00:25:49.348
Now this is a good zombie movie.

478
00:25:51.242 --> 00:25:52.492
Mm-hmm. mm-hmm.

479
00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:55.580
- I'm watching my figure.

480
00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:56.830
- You don't like popcorn?

481
00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:02.620
Where are you going?

482
00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:03.793
- [Caitlyn] I'll be back.

483
00:26:12.625 --> 00:26:13.480
(hand smacking)

484
00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.556
- Is everything all right?

485
00:26:15.556 --> 00:26:17.900
- I'm fine. (crying)

486
00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:19.823
I'm just a little nauseous.

487
00:26:19.823 --> 00:26:23.323
(lively music continues)

488
00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:25.300
- Wait. you're not...

489
00:26:26.224 --> 00:26:28.339
- [Caitlyn] Would it be so bad?

490
00:26:28.339 --> 00:26:30.120
- You know we can't afford a baby!

491
00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:31.490
- I would be a good mother!

492
00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:33.639
- [Jesse] No. you'd be a terrible mother.

493
00:26:33.639 --> 00:26:34.960
- What?

494
00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.377
- Your mother was strung
out when she had you.

495
00:26:36.377 --> 00:26:37.560
and you're the same way.

496
00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:38.983
- I am not!

497
00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:42.070
- Please. why do you think you're sick?

498
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:44.690
You don't eat anything and you
pop those damn pills all day.

499
00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:46.430
I'm surprised you can even walk.

500
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:48.022
Your body needs nutrients.

501
00:26:48.022 --> 00:26:50.109
- I get nutrients!

502
00:26:50.109 --> 00:26:52.380
- Aw. fuck it! I'll be in the living room.

503
00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.033
Enjoy your bumelia. bitch.

504
00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:08.623
- You ready for bed. soldier?

505
00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.623
- Put some clothes on.
You look like a whore.

506
00:27:17.586 --> 00:27:20.074
(Caitlyn crying)

507
00:27:20.074 --> 00:27:23.731
You wash that makeup off. you whore!

508
00:27:23.731 --> 00:27:26.530
(Caitlyn crying)

509
00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:29.307
what the fuck is your problem?

510
00:27:29.307 --> 00:27:31.243
- You haven't been the same
since you've been back.

511
00:27:31.243 --> 00:27:34.160
- Are you seriously
blaming this on the Army?

512
00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.150
- [Caitlyn] What do you mean?

513
00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:39.580
- I mean a slut like you
is only good for one thing.

514
00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:41.000
- You're hurting me.

515
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.100
- Fuck this. I'm out.

516
00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:43.933
- Jesse!

517
00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:48.952
What the hell is he doing?

518
00:27:48.952 --> 00:27:52.017
- [Tori] Oh my god.

519
00:27:52.017 --> 00:27:54.650
- Ew. seriously? Is he
really blowing some dude?

520
00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:58.214
- Seriously. This blows.

521
00:27:58.214 --> 00:27:59.411
- Ugh.

522
00:27:59.411 --> 00:28:01.413
God. that's disgusting.

523
00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.850
- I tell you. this is
some Jerry Springer shit.

524
00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:07.283
- That's so gross.

525
00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.265
- Guess that's where you
get eat a dick up in a cup.

526
00:28:12.265 --> 00:28:13.660
- [Caitlyn] Oh!

527
00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:18.660
God. ugh.
- Oh my god.

528
00:28:19.012 --> 00:28:20.980
- I think I'm gonna be sick to my stomach.

529
00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:23.355
- It's okay. Hold it in.

530
00:28:23.355 --> 00:28:26.188
(Caitlyn gagging)

531
00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:31.150
- Back for more? What the fuck. Cait?

532
00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:32.800
- Didn't know you swung that way.

533
00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:36.230
- Whatever. What the
fuck are you doing here?

534
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:38.390
- He who loves you will make you weep.

535
00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:39.540
- [Jesse] Huh?

536
00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:42.350
- Where there is love.
there is no darkness.

537
00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:43.740
- [Jesse] What is this?

538
00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:46.727
- Lovers' hearts linked together
will always beat as one.

539
00:28:47.819 --> 00:28:49.389
- Cait. I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

540
00:28:49.389 --> 00:28:51.722
You need to get out of here.

541
00:28:54.461 --> 00:28:55.578
- I loved you!

542
00:28:55.578 --> 00:28:58.161
(Jesse grunts)

543
00:28:59.529 --> 00:29:01.060
- What is this. that show "Cheaters"?

544
00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:02.310
We weren't even together.

545
00:29:04.258 --> 00:29:08.008
(Jesse and Caitlyn grunting)

546
00:29:11.041 --> 00:29:13.084
- [Harley] You think you need some help?

547
00:29:13.084 --> 00:29:14.864
(all grunting)

548
00:29:14.864 --> 00:29:17.697
(Harley grunting)

549
00:29:19.924 --> 00:29:22.408
- [Jesse] Take this phone here.

550
00:29:22.408 --> 00:29:23.936
(Caitlyn grunting)
(Harley moaning)

551
00:29:23.936 --> 00:29:26.230
- You're gonna be okay.

552
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:27.740
No!
(Harley moaning)

553
00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:28.771
Hang on.

554
00:29:28.771 --> 00:29:31.188
(lively music)

555
00:29:31.188 --> 00:29:32.021
(Harley coughing)

556
00:29:32.021 --> 00:29:33.190
Go get some help.

557
00:29:35.659 --> 00:29:40.659
- Go get that ass. (coughing)

558
00:29:44.664 --> 00:29:47.423
- Caitlyn. what happened?

559
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:49.850
Where's Harley?

560
00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:51.323
- She didn't make it!

561
00:29:52.326 --> 00:29:53.676
- [Piper] What do you mean?

562
00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:55.693
- He has her phone.

563
00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.910
- We have to find him!

564
00:29:58.910 --> 00:29:59.913
- [Tori] For Harley!

565
00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:02.793
- For Harley.

566
00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:06.840
What'd you guys wanna be when you grew up?

567
00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.143
I wanted to be a nurse.

568
00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:16.150
The thought of helping people
just makes me feel good.

569
00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:17.443
- Now is not the time.

570
00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:21.780
- [Tori] A mom.

571
00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:22.983
- Can we focus?

572
00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:26.930
- So maybe we should just go to the cops.

573
00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:29.510
- He's got her phone and the videos.

574
00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:31.660
- [Piper] So what's
the plan then. Caitlyn?

575
00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:36.297
- One in the front. two in the back.

576
00:30:36.297 --> 00:30:39.797
(Tori and Piper laughing)

577
00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:42.591
- Harley would've loved that.

578
00:30:42.591 --> 00:30:44.100
(Tori and Piper laughing)

579
00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:46.290
- Record everything.

580
00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:48.516
- After all that's happened?

581
00:30:48.516 --> 00:30:49.406
- Everything.

582
00:30:49.406 --> 00:30:51.445
(dramatic music)

583
00:30:51.445 --> 00:30:53.833
(knuckles rapping)

584
00:30:53.833 --> 00:30:56.166
(dog barks)

585
00:30:58.738 --> 00:31:01.266
- Who are you? What do you want?

586
00:31:01.266 --> 00:31:02.849
- [Piper] I am. um.

587
00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:15.428
- [Crew Member] Look over here.

588
00:31:15.428 --> 00:31:17.788
- Spit it out. I haven't got all night.

589
00:31:17.788 --> 00:31:18.621
- [Piper] I was just wondering

590
00:31:18.621 --> 00:31:22.466
if you heard the good news
about our Lord and Savior?

591
00:31:22.466 --> 00:31:25.299
(mysterious thud)

592
00:31:26.154 --> 00:31:28.473
- [Tori] Who is this fucker?

593
00:31:28.473 --> 00:31:29.947
(Jesse grunts)

594
00:31:29.947 --> 00:31:31.109
(Caitlyn yelling)

595
00:31:31.109 --> 00:31:33.192
- [Crew Member] Cut. cut.

596
00:31:34.308 --> 00:31:35.533
- [Jesse] Why are you doing this?

597
00:31:35.533 --> 00:31:37.272
- [Caitlyn] You never loved me!

598
00:31:37.272 --> 00:31:40.427
(both grunting)

599
00:31:40.427 --> 00:31:41.877
(Jesse grunting)

600
00:31:41.877 --> 00:31:44.794
(Caitlyn grunting)

601
00:31:47.573 --> 00:31:49.227
- You stay down there!

602
00:31:49.227 --> 00:31:52.752
You messed with the wrong chick!

603
00:31:52.752 --> 00:31:56.078
(Jesse grunts)
- Cut.

604
00:31:56.078 --> 00:31:57.745
- [Crew Member] Pretend
you're giving some help.

605
00:31:57.745 --> 00:31:59.495
Get them in the jams.

606
00:32:04.577 --> 00:32:08.173
- [Tori] Are you kidding
me? Fucking kidding me.

607
00:32:10.453 --> 00:32:13.036
(lively music)

608
00:32:14.406 --> 00:32:17.227
Are you kidding me?

609
00:32:17.227 --> 00:32:19.810
(Tori gasping)

610
00:32:25.049 --> 00:32:27.882
(water splashing)

611
00:32:41.577 --> 00:32:43.310
- [Caitlyn] Remember the pain.

612
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:44.143
- Diable!

613
00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:49.953
My wounds may have healed. but
this is what you did to me!

614
00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:54.443
I own this. not you!

615
00:32:54.443 --> 00:32:55.507
(lipstick clatters)

616
00:32:55.507 --> 00:32:57.970
I need to take back what you took from me.

617
00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:00.033
I own this!

618
00:33:03.316 --> 00:33:05.748
(Piper yelling)

619
00:33:05.748 --> 00:33:09.498
(distorted discordant music)

620
00:33:12.597 --> 00:33:15.180
(lively music)

621
00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.023
- We're leaving a legacy.

622
00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:22.780
These men took advantage of us.

623
00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:25.470
They used us. they abused us.

624
00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:27.423
They spat in our faces!

625
00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:32.503
It is time to fight
back and take our pride.

626
00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:35.853
This is the only way!

627
00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:40.853
Piper?

628
00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:43.793
- I need to sleep.

629
00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:48.983
But tomorrow. we finish this.

630
00:33:50.986 --> 00:33:54.569
(Piper sings indistinctly)

631
00:33:56.453 --> 00:33:59.120
(Piper sighing)

632
00:34:10.047 --> 00:34:11.331
- When you're ready.
(knuckles rapping)

633
00:34:11.331 --> 00:34:12.300
- Caitlyn!

634
00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:13.820
- [Caitlyn] Not now. Dad!

635
00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:16.969
- Come on. honey! Let's
watch some "Jeopardy!"

636
00:34:16.969 --> 00:34:18.760
- This is not okay!
- I'm busy!

637
00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.650
- We used to watch
"Jeopardy!" every night.

638
00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:22.549
- Find another way-
- I said leave me

639
00:34:22.549 --> 00:34:24.770
the hell alone.
- What do you want me to say.

640
00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:25.810
Taylor?

641
00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:27.159
- [Taylor] Say that you're.

642
00:34:34.612 --> 00:34:35.779
- Rough night?

643
00:34:36.829 --> 00:34:38.928
- Relationship troubles.

644
00:34:38.928 --> 00:34:41.270
- I know the feeling.

645
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:43.500
- My fiance and I got in a fight earlier.

646
00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:46.453
and my best friend's hanging
out with these new girls that.

647
00:34:47.668 --> 00:34:49.542
she's just not the same.

648
00:34:49.542 --> 00:34:51.040
- Sorry to hear that.

649
00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:54.483
- This one girl. Kate Moss or
something. I don't trust her.

650
00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:56.623
- Caitlyn Ross?

651
00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:59.663
- [Taylor] Yeah. that's her.

652
00:34:59.663 --> 00:35:01.600
- What did you say your friend's name was?

653
00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:02.433
- Piper.

654
00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.700
- Can I borrow your phone?

655
00:35:09.438 --> 00:35:10.271
Thank you.

656
00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:12.973
- Hey.

657
00:35:12.973 --> 00:35:14.940
- Hey! What are you doing?

658
00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:16.320
- Oh. just reading.

659
00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.354
- [Milo] Yeah. anything good?

660
00:35:18.354 --> 00:35:21.200
- It's all right. How about you?

661
00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.013
- It's a special night.

662
00:35:23.013 --> 00:35:23.846
- Yeah?

663
00:35:23.846 --> 00:35:26.123
- You're my special girl.
It's our anniversary.

664
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:29.400
I take it you didn't get me anything?

665
00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.567
- Anniversary?

666
00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:32.570
- Six beautiful months.

667
00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:36.023
- On my bed.
- Oh. I got you something.

668
00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:43.870
- Is she clear?
- Let's keep rolling.

669
00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:45.280
keep rolling.

670
00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.373
We're gonna do it again.

671
00:35:48.238 --> 00:35:50.738
(metal snaps)

672
00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.448
(Taylor whimpering)

673
00:35:57.448 --> 00:36:00.229
- [Piper] Caitlyn. easy there!

674
00:36:00.229 --> 00:36:01.430
- [Caitlyn] Oh. shit!

675
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:02.783
- [Jesse] I thought I told
you never to come back here.

676
00:36:02.783 --> 00:36:04.660
- [Caitlyn] Fuck you. Jesse!

677
00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:06.860
- What's with the masks?
I know who you are.

678
00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.825
- I didn't know you like
getting homes from men.

679
00:36:09.825 --> 00:36:12.145
- (laughs) Well. if you'd
have paid more attention.

680
00:36:12.145 --> 00:36:13.917
you might've known that a lot earlier.

681
00:36:13.917 --> 00:36:15.139
- What are you trying to say?

682
00:36:15.139 --> 00:36:16.450
- Why do you think I left you?

683
00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:18.780
- I left you. you abusive bastard!

684
00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:20.130
- Back.

685
00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:22.000
Is that what you've been
telling your friends.

686
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.917
that I hit you?

687
00:36:23.917 --> 00:36:25.940
You always were a psychotic bitch.

688
00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:27.590
- [Caitlyn] Stop saying that!

689
00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:29.410
- [Jesse] What. bitch?

690
00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:31.060
- I loved you. Jesse.

691
00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:32.830
- [Jesse] I have a
restraining order against you.

692
00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:33.663
- Liar!

693
00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:35.970
- What else did you tell them?

694
00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:37.750
- Basically that you're
a complete douchebag

695
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:39.240
and you're proving to us right now.

696
00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:40.073
(lively music)

697
00:36:40.073 --> 00:36:41.310
- These girls were never your friends.

698
00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:43.120
- Shut up!

699
00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.400
- [Jesse] Psycho.

700
00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.859
Stop your. hey!

701
00:36:45.859 --> 00:36:48.830
(Caitlyn grunting)

702
00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:50.457
- I loved you!

703
00:36:50.457 --> 00:36:51.290
Get your phones.

704
00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:54.883
Say it! Say it. dick.

705
00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:58.310
- [Jesse] I love you.

706
00:36:58.310 --> 00:36:59.993
There. are you happy?

707
00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:03.917
(Piper laughs)

708
00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.370
- What are you doing?

709
00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:09.380
- He's dead and it's over.

710
00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:11.540
- It isn't over until I say it's over.

711
00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:13.888
- [Piper] What are you talking about?

712
00:37:13.888 --> 00:37:15.928
(Taylor gasps)

713
00:37:15.928 --> 00:37:20.003
- Poor little Piper. getting
mixed up with the wrong guy.

714
00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:22.850
- I don't understand.

715
00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:24.850
- (chuckles) You made it so easy.

716
00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:26.200
At least he loved you.

717
00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.040
- He put me in the hospital.

718
00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:30.030
- He who loves you will make you.

719
00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:31.060
- [Piper] What?

720
00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:33.910
- Lovers' hearts linked together
will always beat as one.

721
00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.470
- Why are you doing this?

722
00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:39.440
- He's gay! He's fucking gay.

723
00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:41.500
- I thought he was abusing you!

724
00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:45.270
- (laughs) He never hit me.

725
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:47.874
He never even yelled at me.

726
00:37:47.874 --> 00:37:51.480
I made it all up there.
There. are you happy?

727
00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:52.770
- Why?

728
00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:54.520
- I couldn't stand the thought
of my life without him.

729
00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:57.355
and when I found out he
left me for another man.

730
00:37:57.355 --> 00:38:01.690
(laughs) no. no way. no way.

731
00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:03.993
- You talked us into killing our exes.

732
00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:08.803
- It might not have been a
revenge in the typical sense.

733
00:38:08.803 --> 00:38:09.980
but who does he think he is

734
00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:12.310
pushing me aside like I'm nothing.

735
00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:13.885
- You really are insane.

736
00:38:13.885 --> 00:38:15.106
(Caitlyn inhales deeply)

737
00:38:15.106 --> 00:38:15.939
(Piper grunts)

738
00:38:15.939 --> 00:38:17.230
(Caitlyn laughs)
God!

739
00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:18.450
- Boom. bitch!

740
00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:19.960
How does that feel?
- What the fuck

741
00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:20.801
is wrong with you?

742
00:38:20.801 --> 00:38:24.620
- I just want what everyone
else wants. immortality.

743
00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:25.830
Is that so much to ask?

744
00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:28.430
- And the Slasher Sisters or whatever?

745
00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:29.610
- It's already online

746
00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:31.490
or it's going viral as we speak.

747
00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:33.991
- [Piper] You won't get away with this.

748
00:38:33.991 --> 00:38:37.180
- Aw. honey. but I already have.

749
00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:38.480
and you're my last victim.

750
00:38:39.347 --> 00:38:40.934
(Piper grunts)
(Caitlyn grunts)

751
00:38:40.934 --> 00:38:42.839
(Caitlyn gasping)

752
00:38:42.839 --> 00:38:44.589
- [Piper] I gotta go!

753
00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:47.237
- You honestly.

754
00:38:47.237 --> 00:38:50.780
(grunts) What about...

755
00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:53.707
- The Slasher Sisters can have her.

756
00:38:53.707 --> 00:38:54.540
Come on.

757
00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:56.530
- I thought we were friends.

758
00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:57.371
- [Piper] Fuck you!

759
00:38:57.371 --> 00:39:00.038
(Piper gasping)

760
00:39:02.176 --> 00:39:03.435
- Stop.
- Cut.

761
00:39:03.435 --> 00:39:06.185
(Taylor gasping)

762
00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:14.783
- It's. it's gonna.
it's gonna be all right.

763
00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:17.170
- We have to get you to the hospital.

764
00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:20.883
Wait. Taylor. Taylor!

765
00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:24.430
Wait. we're gonna get you to a hospital.

766
00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:28.027
Taylor! Taylor. no!

767
00:39:28.922 --> 00:39:29.839
Taylor! No.

768
00:39:33.939 --> 00:39:36.522
(Piper crying)

769
00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:40.533
- Cut.
- Okay.

770
00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:59.210
- Everything is gonna be all right.

771
00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:14.560
- Thank you. Dorene.

772
00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:16.720
We've received reports
from around the country

773
00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:19.340
of organized crime rumored to be committed

774
00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:21.193
by girls wearing these.

775
00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:25.170
The latest info is that
they're calling themselves

776
00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:27.390
the Slasher Sisters.

777
00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:31.180
Police are urging citizens to
be cautious around strangers.

778
00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:33.080
and if you don't need
to be out after dark.

779
00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:34.513
please stay inside.

780
00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:36.970
We're not sure who they're targeting.

781
00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:40.700
but we are investigating
rumors of a video containing

782
00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:43.320
the potential identity of their leader.

783
00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:45.270
We don't know how large their numbers are.

784
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:47.930
but an alleged uprising is being reported

785
00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:51.370
as far away as New York and Los Angeles.

786
00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:54.933
Until we know. oh.
what's happening right...

787
00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.077
Pete. Pete. oh my God.
Pete. Pete. look out!

788
00:40:58.968 --> 00:41:01.885
(reporter screams)

789
00:41:04.634 --> 00:41:06.358
(Pete grunting)

790
00:41:06.358 --> 00:41:08.941
(lively music)

791
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:22.830
- Jesse's gonna pay for what he did to me.

792
00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:26.050
and none of these bitches
are gonna get in my way.

793
00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:27.620
To anyone watching this.

794
00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:29.220
you don't have to be the victim.

795
00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:32.840
Take a stand for yourself
for women everywhere.

796
00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:35.720
Wherever you see this
mask in your neighborhood.

797
00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:39.700
even around the country. know
that justice is being served.

798
00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:41.720
It's our time to fight back.

799
00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:44.233
We're not gonna let you
push us around anymore.

800
00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:50.110
They say that life is sweet.
but I say revenge is sweeter.

801
00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:53.977
This is Caitlyn Ross for the
Slasher Sisters signing off.

802
00:41:55.058 --> 00:41:57.808
(dramatic music)

803
00:42:10.335 --> 00:42:12.918
(lively music)

804
00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:13.540
(lively music continues)
