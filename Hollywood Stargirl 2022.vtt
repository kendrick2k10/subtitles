and I feel like.

I know that's not why we left.
but is this gonna be a thing now?

be an adventure is another.

00:13:19.708 --> 00:13:22.750
-Just stay. Don't move. okay?
-Okay.

178
00:13:22.833 --> 00:13:23.916
Don't move.

179
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.791
So. my brother and I.
we're making this movie.

180
00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.500
and it's got music in it.

181
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.166
And when I heard you singing up there.
I was like. "Wow."

182
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:34.291

183
00:13:35.083 --> 00:13:37.541

(PLAYS KAZOO)

185
00:13:41.166 --> 00:13:42.208
All right.

186
00:13:42.291 --> 00:13:46.458
Anyway. our movie. my brother Terrell.
he's gonna direct it and I wrote it.

187
00:13:46.916 --> 00:13:49.166
We emailed our script
to a bunch of producers.

188
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:50.750
but no one seemed interested.

189
00:13:50.833 --> 00:13:52.875
so Terrell read up on
a couple of film blogs that

190
00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:56.583
if you're new or you want to get noticed.
you gotta make a sizzle reel.

191
00:13:57.041 --> 00:13:58.208
A what?

192
00:13:58.291 --> 00:14:02.000
Oh. it's like a little movie
or a part of a movie.

193
00:14:02.083 --> 00:14:04.916
or just something to show
what your big movie will be like.

194
00:14:05.041 --> 00:14:07.291
-Okay.
-And I'm gonna be in it.

195
00:14:07.791 --> 00:14:09.125
but we need a girl for it.

196
00:14:10.916 --> 00:14:13.125
And you could be the perfect girl.

197
00:14:13.708 --> 00:14:16.208
-Um.
-What?

198
00:14:16.291 --> 00:14:20.625
I just... I've never acted before.

199
00:14:20.708 --> 00:14:23.250
-But you sing. You sing. right?
-That's true.

200
00:14:24.208 --> 00:14:26.208
So do you write your own stuff?

201
00:14:26.333 --> 00:14:28.458
-Just covers.
-Okay. okay.

202
00:14:28.833 --> 00:14:30.416
We want original songs for the movie.

203
00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.500
but we'll probably do
a cover for the sizzle.

204
00:14:32.625 --> 00:14:33.708
-Okay.
-Yeah.

205
00:14:34.916 --> 00:14:38.083
So. uh. what's the movie about?

206
00:14:39.291 --> 00:14:43.291
Oh. it's about this guy.
he's about to graduate high school.

207
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.875
and he's not sure what he wants
to do with his life yet.

208
00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:49.375
and he tries a bunch of different things.
but nothing seems to stick.

209
00:14:50.291 --> 00:14:52.000
And just when he's about to lose hope.

210
00:14:52.083 --> 00:14:54.666
he goes to this party
that he almost didn't go to.

211
00:14:55.708 --> 00:14:56.875
and he meets this girl.

212
00:14:58.666 --> 00:15:02.000
And getting to know her
helps him figure things out.

213
00:15:03.041 --> 00:15:04.166
Oh...

214
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.375
So...

215
00:15:05.916 --> 00:15:09.000
She's only in the story to help him?

216
00:15:09.083 --> 00:15:12.000
Oh. no. No. no. No.

217
00:15:12.583 --> 00:15:15.375
Sorry. No. she's not.
She's her own person. definitely.

218
00:15:15.791 --> 00:15:19.958
Just getting to know her helps him realize
that he has to figure it out on his own.

219
00:15:20.041 --> 00:15:23.250
She doesn't. like. figure it out for him.
She got her own story to tell.

220
00:15:24.333 --> 00:15:27.458
And it's in the end. the last scene.
the big musical number on the beach.

221
00:15:27.541 --> 00:15:30.625
where he realizes all of this.
that he'd been trying to be the person

222
00:15:30.708 --> 00:15:32.375
that he thought she wanted him to be.

223
00:15:32.791 --> 00:15:33.958
And they sing.

224
00:15:35.791 --> 00:15:37.791
-they dance.
-(BOTH LAUGH)

225
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:40.750
And then she leaves.

226
00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.083
Uh. what's it called?

227
00:15:47.416 --> 00:15:48.416
Tell Your Story.

228
00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:51.458
-What?
-The title is Tell Your Story.

229

-The title is Tell Your Story. Um...
-Yeah.

230
00:15:53.791 --> 00:15:56.500
Right. that's cool. I like it.
I like it. that's cool.

231
00:15:57.666 --> 00:16:01.833
So my brother works at this club. Forte.

232
00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:05.666
They have a bar. but. you know.
sometimes they let me in through the back.

233
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:08.791
They have great music. and on Wednesdays.
they have open mic.

234
00:16:08.875 --> 00:16:10.041
so it's a little more lax.

235
00:16:10.708 --> 00:16:12.000
You should come meet him.

237
00:16:15.875 --> 00:16:18.333

quit and how they wound up with me.

about this than I need to.

you gotta do it all the way.

Who exactly are you. again?

We can get started
with rehearsing the sizzle.

468
00:31:55.416 --> 00:31:57.750
I still don't totally understand
what that is.

469
00:31:57.833 --> 00:31:59.458
You will. Mostly we need to figure out

470
00:31:59.541 --> 00:32:01.708
what song we'll use
so we can start rehearsing.

471
00:32:01.791 --> 00:32:04.583
We need something that feels right
and isn't overplayed.

heard me sing.

was there the other night.

That's so crazy.

what happened to her.

00:34:18.208 --> 00:34:20.791
She put out one album
and then just... Nothing.

503
00:34:20.875 --> 00:34:22.416
Like. how do you even do that?

504
00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:26.208
How do you make something
so good and then just stop?

-There he is.

No. I'm on thin ice as it is.

Let's take a break.

823
00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:09.250
You asked me
why I didn't make another album.

824
00:56:13.166 --> 00:56:17.458
It was a bad situation. when I was a kid.

825
00:56:18.333 --> 00:56:19.958
So I left.

826
00:56:21.458 --> 00:56:22.916
It was scary.

827
00:56:23.791 --> 00:56:25.208
But I always felt better

828
00:56:25.291 --> 00:56:30.166
when I found the artists
and musicians. street performers.

829
00:56:30.250 --> 00:56:32.625
With people sharing something.

830
00:56:33.291 --> 00:56:36.958
And my voice got me places.
Clubs. parties.

831
00:56:37.583 --> 00:56:39.041
Mostly Forte.

832
00:56:40.541 --> 00:56:43.375
And eventually. here.

833
00:56:45.666 --> 00:56:49.375
This is where I recorded Miracle Mile.

834
00:56:52.083 --> 00:56:54.416
I put everything I had into it. I was 20.

835
00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.708
And then.

836
00:56:59.208 --> 00:57:01.916
nobody wanted it.

837
00:57:04.916 --> 00:57:07.541
I couldn't separate myself from the work.

838
00:57:07.625 --> 00:57:13.958
And I... And I didn't love myself enough
to be okay with failing.

839
00:57:15.791 --> 00:57:18.083
I felt like nobody wanted me.

840
00:57:21.541 --> 00:57:27.041
So I buried the album.
changed my name. started producing.

841
00:57:28.875 --> 00:57:31.083
And it turned out.
I was pretty good at it.

842
00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:38.666
But the most important thing I was able
to do with my success was save Forte.

843
00:57:39.708 --> 00:57:40.916
What do you mean?

844
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.291
A few years back.
the landlords were making it really hard

845
00:57:43.375 --> 00:57:47.083
for Iggy to keep it open.
and so I did him a favor.

846
00:57:48.833 --> 00:57:51.375
Technically. I own the place.

847
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.166

852
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:14.125

reminded me of something.

853
00:58:15.333 --> 00:58:16.416
What?

854
00:58:17.125 --> 00:58:20.666
That just 'cause it doesn't look like
you thought it would

855
00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:23.375
doesn't mean you're not living your dream.

This is a vintage Bolex 16mm camera.

878
01:00:12.458 --> 01:00:16.041
You shoot film on it.
It's the only way to shoot. in my opinion.

879
01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:18.250
It's...

880
01:00:18.333 --> 01:00:20.250
It's old. but still works.

881
01:00:21.208 --> 01:00:22.708
What?

882
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.791
It's just collecting dust.

884
01:00:29.041 --> 01:00:32.375
Thank you. Mr. Mitchell. Thank you.

885
01:00:32.458 --> 01:00:35.000
You just have to show me
the movie when you've finished it.

886
01:00:35.625 --> 01:00:39.333
-Of course. We wrote a song for it. too.
-Uh. (CHUCKLES)

887
01:00:40.333 --> 01:00:42.625

893
01:00:56.500 --> 01:01:00.083
And on the day. this is when
I'll yell "playback." Come on. Evan.

894
01:01:00.875 --> 01:01:02.458
What does "on the day" mean?

895
01:01:02.541 --> 01:01:03.583
I don't know.

896
01:01:03.666 --> 01:01:05.000
When we shoot it for real.

897
01:01:05.083 --> 01:01:06.208
-Oh!
-Oh. okay.

898
01:01:06.291 --> 01:01:07.291
Okay.

899
01:01:07.666 --> 01:01:10.375

01:01:31.375 --> 01:01:33.333
And this is when you'll kiss.

906
01:01:35.333 --> 01:01:36.958
Okay? I'm good.

907
01:01:37.041 --> 01:01:38.916
And that's a cut on rehearsal.

908
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.500
ANA: It was 1992.

909
01:01:43.541 --> 01:01:46.291
She was amazing.

910
01:01:47.083 --> 01:01:50.083
I bought her tape after the show
and then that was it.

911
01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:53.708
I always wondered what happened.
I can't believe all this.

912
01:01:53.791 --> 01:01:55.000
(CHUCKLES)

913
01:01:57.291 --> 01:01:59.750
Why didn't you ever tell me
you lived here?

914
01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:03.666
It wasn't a great time in my life.

915
01:02:05.666 --> 01:02:08.125
To be honest.
I don't love talking about it.

916
01:02:09.666 --> 01:02:12.500
But Roxanne's music really got me through.

919
01:02:29.458 --> 01:02:31.625
-No. thanks. we're fine.
-Okay.

920
01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:34.416
We're fine.

921
01:02:37.208 --> 01:02:38.625
STARGIRL: Thank you. Mr. Mitchell.

922
01:02:38.708 --> 01:02:40.166
but I talked to Terrell.

923
01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:43.625
and he said we would need to buy the film
and develop it and everything.

924
01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:46.458
And we just...

925
01:02:47.083 --> 01:02:49.166
We don't have the money for that.

926
01:02:50.041 --> 01:02:54.333
-But it was so. so nice of you.
-Sell it.

927
01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:56.250
What?

928
01:02:57.083 --> 01:02:58.666
I don't know how much you could get.

929
01:02:58.750 --> 01:03:01.166
but buy something else
you need for your picture.

930
01:03:01.875 --> 01:03:03.041
I insist.

931
01:03:04.125 --> 01:03:06.583

938
01:03:32.708 --> 01:03:34.416
She wanted to be here. but she had work.

I'm so sad I couldn't be there to see it.

I didn't get to tell you.

964
01:05:07.458 --> 01:05:09.791
Uh. we were able to sell your camera.

965
01:05:10.375 --> 01:05:14.875
and we bought a lens and stuff
for the iPhone.

966
01:05:15.833 --> 01:05:19.791

a little bit more like a real...

Tell Priya I'll sign whatever
she needs to me to sign.

1225
01:21:09.125 --> 01:21:10.500
The song is always yours.

1226
01:21:10.916 --> 01:21:13.625
Anything you need to keep the movie going.

1227
01:21:15.208 --> 01:21:17.666
Just don't forget me
when you own all the places.

1228
01:21:29.541 --> 01:21:32.125
MR. MITCHELL: You know.
I thought I was done.

1229
01:21:33.625 --> 01:21:38.583
I thought I'd just watch my shows.
go to the Gelson's.

1230
01:21:39.291 --> 01:21:42.125
and. um. just wait it out.

1231
01:21:44.041 --> 01:21:45.541
I mean. I was always...

1232
01:21:46.958 --> 01:21:50.333
I was always so good at.
uh. fixing problems with movies.

1233
01:21:50.416 --> 01:21:53.333
but I was never that good in my own life.

1234
01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:56.666
And you just...

1235
01:21:58.250 --> 01:21:59.250
Well...

1236
01:22:00.583 --> 01:22:04.208
You gave me something
that I thought only existed in pictures.

1237
01:22:05.083 --> 01:22:06.083
What?

1238
01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:07.625
Well. suddenly.

1239
01:22:08.333 --> 01:22:10.458
I'm the guy that wants to know everything

1240
01:22:11.958 --> 01:22:13.000
and everyone.

1241
01:22:13.833 --> 01:22:15.500
And I want them to know me.

1242
01:22:18.375 --> 01:22:20.041
And I'm gonna call my son.

1243
01:22:27.625 --> 01:22:30.000
If you could leave me
with one piece of advice.

1244
01:22:32.083 --> 01:22:33.416
what would it be?

1245
01:22:35.708 --> 01:22:38.416
Make mistakes. but don't regret them.

1246
01:22:40.041 --> 01:22:41.166
Learn from them.

1247
01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:46.875
Because regrets are the hardest things
to carry when you get older.

1248
01:22:50.791 --> 01:22:54.208
Oh. and get yourself a flip phone.

1249
01:22:55.791 --> 01:22:57.208
So that you and I can talk.

1250
01:23:00.041 --> 01:23:03.000
How else are you gonna tell me
how it goes with your son?

1251
01:23:03.583 --> 01:23:04.875
Well. there you go.

1252
01:23:20.708 --> 01:23:22.166
I screwed this up.

1253
01:23:23.250 --> 01:23:25.458
Okay? I know I did.

1254
01:23:27.333 --> 01:23:29.000
I screwed it up a lot.

1255
01:23:31.375 --> 01:23:32.708
But you're great.

1256
01:23:33.166 --> 01:23:34.458
You're so great.

1257
01:23:35.166 --> 01:23:38.250
You are. like. the most alive person
I've ever met.

1258
01:23:39.958 --> 01:23:41.000
(SIGHS)

1259
01:23:45.416 --> 01:23:47.541
I stress out about

1260
01:23:47.666 --> 01:23:50.500
not being able to support us
or take care of you.

1261
01:23:50.583 --> 01:23:52.166
I just... I look at you.

1262
01:23:53.208 --> 01:23:58.041
I think. "I made her.
and she's so extraordinary."

1263
01:23:59.750 --> 01:24:01.375
So at least I did that right.

1264
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.625
I have done so many things
wrong in my life. but thank God

1265
01:24:07.041 --> 01:24:09.708
the thing that mattered most
turned out the best.

1266
01:24:16.458 --> 01:24:19.166
I think about how hard
it must be to have a kid.

1267
01:24:20.666 --> 01:24:24.708
And how much harder
it must be to do it alone.

1268
01:24:26.333 --> 01:24:27.833
You think about that?

1269
01:24:28.208 --> 01:24:29.500
Sometimes. yeah.

1270
01:24:30.958 --> 01:24:32.958
I know 40-year-olds
who don't think about that.

1271
01:24:33.208 --> 01:24:34.208
(LAUGHS)

1272
01:24:40.583 --> 01:24:44.625
When I came to LA in the '90s.
when I saw Roxanne.

1273
01:24:45.583 --> 01:24:47.625
I was here doing a movie.

1274
01:24:47.708 --> 01:24:49.625
-You were?
-Yeah. I was.

1275
01:24:49.708 --> 01:24:53.125
I always wanted to do movies.
It was my dream.

1276
01:24:54.125 --> 01:24:56.041
And the director didn't like my work.

1277
01:24:56.250 --> 01:24:59.375
And he ended up not being a nice person.

1278
01:24:59.458 --> 01:25:02.875
which is becoming. uh.
a little bit of a theme.

1279
01:25:03.208 --> 01:25:04.791
Either way. I got fired.

1280
01:25:05.791 --> 01:25:08.875
And I was so sad. so embarrassed.

1281
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.125
So I just left LA.

1282
01:25:13.958 --> 01:25:15.291
and I felt better.

1283
01:25:16.708 --> 01:25:19.208
I thought it was easier
just not to deal with it.

1284
01:25:19.291 --> 01:25:22.000
which I know is wrong and terrible. but...

1285
01:25:23.250 --> 01:25:26.000
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

1286
01:25:27.583 --> 01:25:30.125
It just feels like
it's happening all over again.

1287
01:25:31.250 --> 01:25:32.875
And I feel so foolish.

1288
01:25:34.875 --> 01:25:36.041
No. Mom.

1289
01:25:36.958 --> 01:25:38.000
It's brave.

1290
01:25:39.625 --> 01:25:41.125
You were alone.

1291
01:25:42.208 --> 01:25:43.875
But you're not alone anymore.

1292
01:25:45.125 --> 01:25:48.041
I don't want you to lose what you
have here. I really don't.

1293
01:25:48.166 --> 01:25:49.750
So. then what if we didn't go?

1294
01:25:51.208 --> 01:25:53.666
Daphne said that she would give us
the month free.

1295
01:25:53.750 --> 01:25:57.916
It's not the rent. I have rent.
I don't have a job.

1296
01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.875
-You'll find one.
-What if I don't?

1297
01:25:59.958 --> 01:26:02.583
-And what if the Berkeley thing goes away?
-I don't know.

1298
01:26:04.041 --> 01:26:08.041
But I will be right by your side.
no matter what happens.

1299
01:26:09.250 --> 01:26:13.041
So. I'm asking just this once.

1300
01:26:14.958 --> 01:26:16.125
What if we stayed?

1301
01:26:18.750 --> 01:26:21.333
'Cause I do what I want.
I say what I feel

1302
01:26:21.416 --> 01:26:23.958
I follow the light to find something real

1303
01:26:24.041 --> 01:26:27.541
I hold on to what I have here and now

1304
01:26:28.708 --> 01:26:33.500
Yeah. I know you wear silver coats

1305
01:26:33.583 --> 01:26:40.000
But I know we're all.
we're all made of gold

1306
01:26:41.333 --> 01:26:43.125
-(WHOOPING)
-Thank you so much.

1307
01:26:46.458 --> 01:26:49.833
Keep it going for Cousin Bryan.
singing the same song

1308
01:26:50.250 --> 01:26:53.708
-he sings every single week.
-(CHEERING)

1309
01:26:53.791 --> 01:26:58.375
All right. I am so excited to bring
this next group to the stage.

1310
01:26:58.458 --> 01:27:02.125
It's actually their first time
performing together. so be nice.

1311
01:27:02.208 --> 01:27:07.041
Big round of applause
for Table Six and the Shirley Temples.

1312
01:27:07.125 --> 01:27:08.541
Let 'em hear it.

1313
01:27:08.625 --> 01:27:10.666
(CHEERING)

1314
01:27:23.208 --> 01:27:27.791
So. I'm sitting at my table
like I do every night...

1315
01:27:27.875 --> 01:27:29.333
Table six forever.

1316
01:27:29.791 --> 01:27:32.416
As I was saying. I'm sitting at my table

1317
01:27:32.541 --> 01:27:35.000
and Iggy comes up to me
and tells me I need to go outside.

1318
01:27:35.083 --> 01:27:36.916
-It's really important.
-(LAUGHTER)

1319
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.166
I was annoyed.

1320
01:27:39.041 --> 01:27:43.333
But then I get out there
and it's this kid.

1321
01:27:44.458 --> 01:27:46.750
When I saw it was this kid.
I wasn't so mad anymore.

1322
01:27:46.833 --> 01:27:48.583
She has that effect on us grumps.

1323
01:27:48.958 --> 01:27:53.541
Hell. she is the first person to get me
on this stage in 15 years.

1324
01:27:54.666 --> 01:27:56.250
(CHEERING)

1325
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.833
Sometimes we just go. you know?

1326
01:28:02.583 --> 01:28:06.041
And we go. and we go. and we go.

1327
01:28:07.291 --> 01:28:08.500
She made me stop.

1328
01:28:11.541 --> 01:28:12.708
She made me look.

1329
01:28:14.791 --> 01:28:16.833
Sometimes it's that simple.

1330
01:28:24.708 --> 01:28:25.708
(SIGHS)

1331
01:28:26.250 --> 01:28:30.541
The first time I was up here.
I had just gotten to LA.

1332
01:28:31.958 --> 01:28:37.125
And all I wanted was to stay somewhere
long enough to make some real friends.

1333
01:28:38.625 --> 01:28:40.000
And I got more than that.

1334
01:28:41.583 --> 01:28:44.833
Something I never expected.

1335
01:28:46.916 --> 01:28:47.916
I got a home.

1336
01:28:50.125 --> 01:28:52.541
I've always had a family.

1337
01:28:53.083 --> 01:28:54.958
just my mom and me. and...

1338
01:28:56.083 --> 01:28:58.958
we've gotten each other through a lot.

1339
01:29:01.416 --> 01:29:03.250
But we've never had a home.

1340
01:29:03.875 --> 01:29:06.166
And I don't mean a building.

1341
01:29:07.666 --> 01:29:12.708
Home is somewhere you feel safe
to dream crazy things.

1342
01:29:13.083 --> 01:29:15.875
and the people there are crazy enough
to dream them with you.

1343
01:29:17.833 --> 01:29:19.041
But also

1344
01:29:19.125 --> 01:29:22.291
be there for you when things
don't turn out the way you hoped.

1345
01:29:23.833 --> 01:29:28.791
My home turned out to be
a random bunch of people.

1346
01:29:29.541 --> 01:29:33.250
And now I never want to be
without them again.

1347
01:29:35.875 --> 01:29:37.291
And so...

1348
01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:40.500
we're staying.

1349
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:43.250
My mom and I are staying.

1350
01:29:43.791 --> 01:29:46.041
-Yeah. we are!
-(LAUGHTER)

1351
01:29:46.166 --> 01:29:47.291
Do you hear that. Evan?

1352
01:29:47.375 --> 01:29:49.250
Oh. I hear it. and I love it.

1353
01:29:52.666 --> 01:29:55.333
I'm staying in LA. I'm staying in LA.

1354
01:29:55.416 --> 01:29:57.166
It's my home. It's my home.

1355
01:29:57.750 --> 01:29:59.791
And I'm making a movie in my home.

1356
01:30:00.250 --> 01:30:01.833
Big cheer.

1357
01:30:01.916 --> 01:30:03.333
(ALL CHEERING)

1358
01:30:05.041 --> 01:30:07.000
And I'm getting a flip phone.

1359
01:30:07.375 --> 01:30:08.375
Yes.

1360
01:30:08.583 --> 01:30:10.333
(LAUGHTER)

1361
01:30:10.416 --> 01:30:15.666
So. here is one of Roxanne's.
and my old favorites.

1362
01:30:16.125 --> 01:30:19.416
And this one
is for all the dreamers out there.

1363
01:30:20.416 --> 01:30:21.916
(MUSIC STARTS)

1364
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.208
When I met you in the restaurant

1365
01:30:53.250 --> 01:30:57.208
You could tell I was no debutante

1366
01:31:00.333 --> 01:31:03.666
You asked me what's my pleasure

1367
01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:06.666
A movie or a measure?

1368
01:31:06.750 --> 01:31:11.125
I'll have a cup of tea and tell you of my

1369
01:31:11.208 --> 01:31:14.083
Dreaming

1370
01:31:14.166 --> 01:31:16.458
Dreaming is free

1371
01:31:17.166 --> 01:31:18.666
Dreaming

1372
01:31:20.208 --> 01:31:22.666
Dreaming is free

1373
01:31:23.166 --> 01:31:27.125
I don't want to live on charity

1374
01:31:29.166 --> 01:31:33.041
Pleasure's real or is it fantasy?

1375
01:31:33.125 --> 01:31:34.916
MAN: Table Six forever!

1376
01:31:35.541 --> 01:31:39.166
Reel to reel is living rarity

1377
01:31:39.916 --> 01:31:42.375
People stop and stare at me

1378
01:31:42.791 --> 01:31:45.333
We just walk on by

1379
01:31:45.416 --> 01:31:48.750
We just keep on dreaming

1380
01:31:50.208 --> 01:31:53.708
-Beat feet
-Walking a two mile

1381
01:31:53.791 --> 01:31:56.333
-Meet meet
-Meet me at the turnstile

1382
01:31:56.458 --> 01:32:01.208
I never met him. I'll never forget him

1383
01:32:02.708 --> 01:32:05.416
-Dream. dream
-Even for a little while

1384
01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:08.708
-Dream. dream
-Filling up an idle hour

1385
01:32:08.791 --> 01:32:10.375
Fade away.

1386
01:32:10.458 --> 01:32:11.541
Whoo!

1387
01:32:11.625 --> 01:32:13.041
Radiate

1388
01:32:17.458 --> 01:32:22.125
I sit by and watch the river flow

1389
01:32:23.333 --> 01:32:27.333
I sit by and watch the traffic go

1390
01:32:29.083 --> 01:32:33.250
Imagine something of your very own

1391
01:32:33.708 --> 01:32:36.458
Something you can have and hold

1392
01:32:36.583 --> 01:32:41.166
I'd build a road in gold just to have some

1393
01:32:41.250 --> 01:32:44.166
Dreaming

1394
01:32:44.250 --> 01:32:47.166
Dreaming is free

1395
01:32:47.250 --> 01:32:49.083

You?

What will the ending be like

1437
01:36:19.375 --> 01:36:21.958
Heaven knows

1438
01:36:22.958 --> 01:36:26.958
Maybe the world's all right

1439
01:36:27.750 --> 01:36:31.333
But you can't tell the story alone

1440
01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:38.958
Laying in my bed. I'm wide awake

1441
01:36:39.041 --> 01:36:43.458
And I became another day

1442
01:36:43.541 --> 01:36:46.958
Remembering is not fake

1443
01:36:47.916 --> 01:36:51.166
The bus here's usually late

1444
01:36:52.791 --> 01:36:56.583
And so I waited for a while

1445
01:36:56.666 --> 01:37:00.708
I smiled a Mona Lisa smile

1446
01:37:00.791 --> 01:37:04.375
'Cause everything's suddenly new

1447
01:37:05.375 --> 01:37:08.916
The sky is impossibly blue

1448
01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.458
Even with no moon tonight

1449
01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:16.416
Heaven knows

1450
01:37:17.625 --> 01:37:21.958
That maybe the world's all right

1451
01:37:22.666 --> 01:37:26.208
But you can't tell the story alone

1452
01:37:29.958 --> 01:37:33.625
It would all be incomplete

1453
01:37:33.708 --> 01:37:37.208
A car without a wheel

1454
01:37:38.416 --> 01:37:42.125
A broken heart without a beat

1455
01:37:42.208 --> 01:37:47.125
At least I know that's how I feel

1456
01:37:47.208 --> 01:37:51.000
Waiting for the Rose Parade

1457
01:37:51.541 --> 01:37:55.708
Behind the...

1458
01:37:55.791 --> 01:37:59.250
A dream day with a...

1459
01:38:00.250 --> 01:38:03.583
I dreamt it was better with you

1460
01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:08.750
What will the ending be like

1461
01:38:08.833 --> 01:38:11.583
Ah. heaven knows

1462
01:38:12.458 --> 01:38:16.750
And you can try with all your might

1463
01:38:17.416 --> 01:38:21.250
But you can't tell the story alone

1464
01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.958
Maybe the world's all right

1465
01:38:32.791 --> 01:38:37.708
But I can't tell the story alone
