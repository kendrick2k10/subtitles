3
00:00:50.912 --> 00:00:55.193
Hawaii. the place
that makes you or breaks you

4
00:00:55.227 --> 00:00:57.540
as a professional surfer.

5
00:00:57.574 --> 00:01:01.751
They say if you can
make it here. you've made it.

6
00:01:01.785 --> 00:01:08.068
Professional surfing is one
of the most cut throat
and elite sports in the world.

7
00:01:08.102 --> 00:01:12.796
Competitive surfers often gruel
through a 40 contest year

8
00:01:12.831 --> 00:01:17.215
and dedicate every aspect
of their lives
to try to make it as a top pro.

9
00:01:19.355 --> 00:01:23.393
Thirty four male surfers
qualify for the
world championship tour.

10
00:01:23.428 --> 00:01:25.602
A dream tour
with rock star treatment

11
00:01:25.637 --> 00:01:28.088
and massive paydays
for winning events.

12
00:01:29.744 --> 00:01:31.056
But at the end of the year.

13
00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:35.233
only one surfer
is named world champion.

14
00:01:35.267 --> 00:01:37.545
This is a goal
that very few humans

15
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.616
in history
will ever accomplish.

16
00:01:39.651 --> 00:01:41.618
but one of the only ways

17
00:01:41.653 --> 00:01:45.070
to truly make it
in professional surfing.

18
00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:47.452
Basically.
if you're not on top.

19
00:01:47.486 --> 00:01:51.145
your sponsor could drop you
after one bad year.

20
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.736
Many surf careers
have sadly ended
at the hand of a corporation.

21
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.773
Now. this is just the reality
for most surfers.

22
00:01:58.808 --> 00:02:00.534
but not all of them.

23
00:02:03.053 --> 00:02:06.505
Let me introduce you
to my friend Ben Gravy.

24
00:02:08.093 --> 00:02:09.853
Now. this might come
as a shock.

25
00:02:09.888 --> 00:02:11.717
but Ben isn't from Hawaii.

26
00:02:11.752 --> 00:02:14.962
and Ben doesn't surf
on the world tour.

27
00:02:14.996 --> 00:02:18.345
Ben Gravy is showing
the entire surfing world

28
00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.933
that there's another way
to do it.

29
00:02:20.968 --> 00:02:24.903
Ben has proved to everyone.
surfer and non-surfer alike.

30
00:02:24.937 --> 00:02:27.457
that you don't have to settle
in life.

31
00:02:27.492 --> 00:02:31.461
Ben has proved that you can
live your life for the dream.

32
00:03:27.862 --> 00:03:29.485
All right. so we're heading
down to the campsite now.

33
00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.245
We don't know if these guys
are awake or asleep.

34
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.351
We just drove 46 hours straight.

35
00:03:33.385 --> 00:03:35.560
So. we're completely delusional.

36
00:03:35.594 --> 00:03:37.700
Literally in the middle
of nowhere.

37
00:03:38.425 --> 00:03:39.736
Anybody?

38
00:03:41.497 --> 00:03:42.670
Nope. nothing.

39
00:03:43.533 --> 00:03:45.190
Anybody?

40
00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:47.088
All right?
Here's the situation on my end.

41
00:03:47.123 --> 00:03:48.676
I have no idea where I am.

42
00:03:48.711 --> 00:03:50.747
And I brought every board
in my quiver.

43
00:03:50.782 --> 00:03:54.026
-So. right there is the wave.

44
00:03:54.061 --> 00:03:56.236
It's a little smaller
than last time we surfed it.

45
00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.479
but I think you'll get
a couple for sure.

46
00:03:58.514 --> 00:03:59.998
Seriously. dude.
Where's the wave?

47
00:04:00.447 --> 00:04:01.724
Where is it?

48
00:04:01.758 --> 00:04:03.104
Whoo!

49
00:04:14.461 --> 00:04:17.153
All right. we made it down
to the bank of the river.

50
00:04:17.187 --> 00:04:21.778
forty-six hours in the car
and it was all worth it.

51
00:04:21.813 --> 00:04:23.780
I'm about to paddle out
for my first wave.

52
00:04:23.815 --> 00:04:24.781
Whoo!

53
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.694
Forty-six hours to get here.

54
00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:17.282
We just river surfed
the biggest wave

55
00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:19.008
in the United States
for two days straight.

56
00:05:19.595 --> 00:05:20.596
My uncle was here.

57
00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.356
My favorite uncle.
Jamie O'Brien.

58
00:05:22.391 --> 00:05:25.152
-Yeah. brother! Yee-haw!

59
00:05:25.186 --> 00:05:28.120
He was slashing
and we smashed it.

60
00:05:28.155 --> 00:05:30.295
And we're getting on the road.
so we'll see you next time.

61
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.503
-Peace.
-For the dream.

62
00:05:31.538 --> 00:05:33.022
-Pew!
-Bye. guys.

63
00:05:43.377 --> 00:05:44.482
See. I grew up
at the beach.

64
00:05:44.516 --> 00:05:46.311
so we would always come
to the beach.

65
00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:48.589
and Rob's dad had a house
at the beach.

66
00:05:48.624 --> 00:05:50.488
So. we would always come down.

67
00:05:50.522 --> 00:05:53.456
And then it got to a point
where he just started
to love the ocean.

68
00:05:53.491 --> 00:05:55.838
One of our friends
gave Rob a surfboard

69
00:05:55.872 --> 00:06:00.221
for Ben to try. and he loved it.

70
00:06:00.256 --> 00:06:03.017
Probably when he was.
like. seven or eight

71
00:06:03.052 --> 00:06:05.503
is when he started.
like. actually carrying

72
00:06:05.537 --> 00:06:07.297
a surfboard to the beach
to surf.

73
00:06:07.332 --> 00:06:09.092
So he got into it real young.

74
00:06:09.127 --> 00:06:11.923
I mean.
was already surfing contests

75
00:06:11.957 --> 00:06:15.236
by the time he was nine or ten.

76
00:06:19.482 --> 00:06:21.795
The other kids
would go out 15 minutes.

77
00:06:21.829 --> 00:06:22.968
Three hours later. you're like.

78
00:06:23.003 --> 00:06:25.143
"Ben. you gotta
get out of the water."

79
00:06:25.177 --> 00:06:26.696
We gotta get more sun block on.

80
00:06:26.731 --> 00:06:28.353
We gotta... You gotta
have something to eat.

81
00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:30.562
You gotta drink.

82
00:06:30.597 --> 00:06:34.704
All the time was me
with his video camera
in the water for hours.

83
00:06:34.739 --> 00:06:35.912
just filming him surf.

84
00:06:37.638 --> 00:06:40.192
When I was like 13. 14.

85
00:06:40.227 --> 00:06:43.886
I won. like. a bunch
of ESA and NSSA contests.

86
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.647
I won. like.
a bunch of regional contests.

87
00:06:46.682 --> 00:06:51.169
And then when I was 14.
I got sponsored by Billabong.

88
00:06:51.203 --> 00:06:55.276
and I won the East Coast
Championship that same year.

89
00:06:55.311 --> 00:06:58.072
And it was right when I was
coming out of eighth grade.

90
00:06:58.107 --> 00:06:59.384
And my parents
were kind of like.

91
00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.766
"Is this what you want to do?"

92
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.044
And I was like. "Yeah."

93
00:07:04.078 --> 00:07:08.013
My dad calls what we do
The Truman Show.

94
00:07:08.048 --> 00:07:10.188
Because literally
our entire lives

95
00:07:10.222 --> 00:07:12.708
are basically recorded
on either a tape

96
00:07:12.742 --> 00:07:15.400
or a digital format.
in some way.

97
00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:18.299
So. Ben got a video camera
for Christmas.

98
00:07:18.334 --> 00:07:20.301
I think.
when he was eight years old.

99
00:07:20.336 --> 00:07:23.097
Ever since.
he basically has walked around

100
00:07:23.132 --> 00:07:26.722
with a video camera
in his hands.
recording daily life.

101
00:07:26.756 --> 00:07:29.000
Everything that
we've been doing

102
00:07:29.034 --> 00:07:31.140
since we were super.
super young.

103
00:07:31.174 --> 00:07:32.244
He and his friend Michael

104
00:07:32.279 --> 00:07:33.556
used to just
go around the house

105
00:07:33.591 --> 00:07:35.731
and make movies about mummies.

106
00:07:35.765 --> 00:07:38.492
All kinds of crazy stuff.
filming everything.

107
00:07:38.527 --> 00:07:40.839
And we would always try
and find ways to. you know.

108
00:07:40.874 --> 00:07:42.979
get a reaction
or make a video

109
00:07:43.014 --> 00:07:44.325
that was unique.

110
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.569
And it started off just.
like. skateboarding.

111
00:07:46.604 --> 00:07:48.364
throwing rocks at each other.

112
00:07:48.398 --> 00:07:51.194
It kind of evolved into
crazy stuff on our skateboards.

113
00:07:51.229 --> 00:07:53.196
Crazy stuff on our surfboards.
you know.

114
00:07:53.231 --> 00:07:56.303
jumping off of our roof.
Or there was this one video

115
00:07:56.337 --> 00:08:00.203
of our oldest brother. Hob.
going out the window.

116
00:08:00.238 --> 00:08:02.930
like. the third story window
with a hose attached.

117
00:08:02.965 --> 00:08:05.519
We didn't have access to.
like. television or computers.

118
00:08:05.554 --> 00:08:07.452
so it was kind of always like

119
00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:09.972
go find something
to entertain yourself.

120
00:08:10.006 --> 00:08:12.215
Which is kinda weird
because we had video cameras.

121
00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:13.354
but we never watched TV.

122
00:08:19.878 --> 00:08:21.880
Thank you.
I'll be here all week.

123
00:08:24.573 --> 00:08:27.541
That was created
when Ben was. like. ten.

124
00:08:27.576 --> 00:08:30.786
And it originally stood for
Nobody's Unlike Buddy.

125
00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.650
The meaning behind that
was kinda like.

126
00:08:32.684 --> 00:08:34.306
everyone's accepted
in our group

127
00:08:34.341 --> 00:08:36.308
because we weren't
really ever cool.

128
00:08:36.343 --> 00:08:38.690
We were kind of just.
like. nonconformist.

129
00:08:38.725 --> 00:08:40.899
Doing what we like doing.
It wasn't really about.

130
00:08:40.934 --> 00:08:42.556
like. impressing anyone.
And we saw. like.

131
00:08:42.591 --> 00:08:44.282
a lot of other people that.
you know.

132
00:08:44.316 --> 00:08:45.973
either got picked on
or were outcasts

133
00:08:46.008 --> 00:08:48.873
who would kinda fit in
well with us because. you know.

134
00:08:48.907 --> 00:08:50.012
anything goes.

135
00:08:50.046 --> 00:08:51.807
Everyone's importance
is the same.

136
00:08:51.841 --> 00:08:55.362
And I think we figured that out
at a really early age.

137
00:09:02.749 --> 00:09:04.992
He would invite
his friends to come surfing.

138
00:09:05.027 --> 00:09:07.063
And it was such
an all-inclusive activity.

139
00:09:07.098 --> 00:09:09.618
because anybody could get
out there and paddle around.

140
00:09:09.652 --> 00:09:13.000
And he motivated some of
his friends. like Paul Venesz.

141
00:09:13.035 --> 00:09:15.347
to get out there
and feel good about surfing

142
00:09:15.382 --> 00:09:17.833
and know that he could have
the confidence to do it.

143
00:09:17.867 --> 00:09:19.697
If we were all out surfing

144
00:09:19.731 --> 00:09:22.700
and I was paddling
for something.

145
00:09:22.734 --> 00:09:24.322
and it looked like
I was gonna get it.

146
00:09:24.356 --> 00:09:27.325
it didn't matter
where Ben was on the wave.

147
00:09:27.359 --> 00:09:29.741
He started screaming.
"Go. go. go!"

148
00:09:29.776 --> 00:09:31.536
Ben wasn't worried
if it was his wave

149
00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:32.986
because he was closer
to the peak

150
00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:34.366
or any of that.

151
00:09:34.401 --> 00:09:36.472
If he saw that I was gonna
be able to catch it.

152
00:09:36.506 --> 00:09:38.336
he just wanted me to catch it.

153
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:42.064
Just to see me experience it
and enjoy it.

154
00:09:42.098 --> 00:09:46.240
Ben was always more like
I would say the underdog.

155
00:09:46.275 --> 00:09:49.105
But when he started surfing.
he pretty much became

156
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.038
a really good surfer
very quickly.

157
00:09:51.073 --> 00:09:54.732
But he would always
sort of gravitate

158
00:09:54.766 --> 00:09:56.941
toward the kids
that couldn't surf as well

159
00:09:56.975 --> 00:09:59.633
to hang out with and.
like. motivate them.

160
00:09:59.668 --> 00:10:01.842
He wasn't really
one of the guys

161
00:10:01.877 --> 00:10:03.741
that always hung out
with the top tier.

162
00:10:03.775 --> 00:10:06.122
And. I mean. he traveled
on the circuit as he got older.

163
00:10:06.157 --> 00:10:09.125
But in his free time.
he hung out with the Nub crew.

164
00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.369
Which were just kids
from the neighborhood

165
00:10:11.403 --> 00:10:13.474
that surfed casually.

166
00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:14.821
For him. it was always fun.

167
00:10:16.443 --> 00:10:20.758
Shoot. I've known Ben since
I was 13. probably. or 14.

168
00:10:20.792 --> 00:10:22.104
We were doing

169
00:10:22.138 --> 00:10:24.140
the Eastern Surfing Association
contest together.

170
00:10:24.175 --> 00:10:28.110
so I'd see him at regionals
and see him at Easterns.

171
00:10:28.144 --> 00:10:31.113
I feel like
becoming a professional surfer

172
00:10:31.147 --> 00:10:32.632
and growing up
on the East Coast

173
00:10:32.666 --> 00:10:34.599
is. like. such a difficult
thing to do.

174
00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:37.740
It's just hard
because you're out
of the limelight of surfing.

175
00:10:37.775 --> 00:10:40.640
You know. the limelight
is California. Hawaii.

176
00:10:40.674 --> 00:10:44.471
and the East Coast is just
kinda like shed to the side.

177
00:10:44.505 --> 00:10:46.576
Here. you have to. like.
get through the ranks

178
00:10:46.611 --> 00:10:48.613
and make it
to those national competitions

179
00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:50.408
to even get noticed.

180
00:10:50.442 --> 00:10:51.754
Surfing is very small.

181
00:10:51.789 --> 00:10:54.930
You have 30 some guys
on the world tour in the QS

182
00:10:54.964 --> 00:10:56.276
and then free surfers.

183
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:58.519
And the numbers just
aren't really in your favor

184
00:10:58.554 --> 00:11:00.936
to make that your career.

185
00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:02.800
So. he had
the Hi8 camera.

186
00:11:02.834 --> 00:11:04.353
That's what he was filming on.

187
00:11:04.387 --> 00:11:07.805
And then he got.
like. a double VCR.

188
00:11:07.839 --> 00:11:09.669
He would record
the whole Hi8 tape

189
00:11:09.703 --> 00:11:11.740
on the one VHS tape.
and then he would

190
00:11:11.774 --> 00:11:13.845
pick pieces from that
out of that VHS

191
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.986
and record them
onto another VHS tape.

192
00:11:17.021 --> 00:11:20.265
And he somehow had a stereo
hooked up with a cord.

193
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.405
so you could play music
over the bits.

194
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.166
It was just. like. so bizarre.

195
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.375
But it worked.
And then you could copy that

196
00:11:26.409 --> 00:11:27.997
and make a second copy.

197
00:11:28.032 --> 00:11:29.550
Then computers came out.

198
00:11:29.585 --> 00:11:31.725
We started burning DVDs.
And I think Ben went through.

199
00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.624
like. three computers
where he broke the DVD burner

200
00:11:34.659 --> 00:11:36.834
because he was burning
so many DVDs

201
00:11:36.868 --> 00:11:38.525
trying to get our content out.

202
00:11:38.559 --> 00:11:40.389
I don't know. We didn't really
have anything to compare it to.

203
00:11:40.423 --> 00:11:41.977
We were just creating.

204
00:11:42.011 --> 00:11:46.015
And we were all doing. like.
stunts. and it evolved further.

205
00:11:52.228 --> 00:11:56.094
Well. we started
doing stunts when I was a kid.

206
00:11:56.129 --> 00:11:57.647
But. obviously.
as time went on.

207
00:11:57.682 --> 00:11:59.857
the stunts got way crazier.

208
00:11:59.891 --> 00:12:04.551
And it seems like the more that
YouTube came into the picture.

209
00:12:04.585 --> 00:12:06.449
it played a big role.
because the more views

210
00:12:06.484 --> 00:12:09.038
we would get for stunts.
the crazier we would want to go.

211
00:12:20.636 --> 00:12:22.603
You know. I didn't know Ben
when we were younger.

212
00:12:22.638 --> 00:12:24.433
but I saw that. you know.

213
00:12:24.467 --> 00:12:25.848
we obviously
traveled together surfing.

214
00:12:25.883 --> 00:12:27.263
and saw he was building
this career.

215
00:12:27.298 --> 00:12:28.886
And then I do remember.
all of a sudden.

216
00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.853
he was getting
more focused into.

217
00:12:30.888 --> 00:12:33.028
like. the stunt side of things.

218
00:12:34.132 --> 00:12:35.789
Doing some pretty wild stuff.

219
00:12:35.824 --> 00:12:39.793
And I started to correlate.
like. that with less surfing

220
00:12:39.828 --> 00:12:41.105
and less surf attention.

221
00:12:41.139 --> 00:12:42.623
and I was. like.
kinda bummed for him

222
00:12:42.658 --> 00:12:45.903
because I saw
he had something in surfing.

223
00:12:45.937 --> 00:12:48.250
And then I was watching it
kinda slip away.

224
00:12:55.602 --> 00:12:56.879
So that was a concern.

225
00:12:56.914 --> 00:12:59.917
And then. as they got older.
that continued.

226
00:12:59.951 --> 00:13:02.643
Then it was like.
"Oh. we'll do a car jump."

227
00:13:02.678 --> 00:13:04.680
And so they're prompting
all this stuff.

228
00:13:04.714 --> 00:13:06.924
And along with that.
they are getting older.

229
00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.235
and they're drinking more.

230
00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:11.618
♪ I wanna drink beer
I wanna drink beer

231
00:13:13.965 --> 00:13:17.003
♪ I wanna drink beer
I'm gonna drink beer... ♪

232
00:13:20.592 --> 00:13:23.457
So. for. like
eight or ten years

233
00:13:23.492 --> 00:13:26.322
with three sons doing
the same thing. it was hell.

234
00:13:26.357 --> 00:13:29.843
So. was I concerned?
Yeah. I was really concerned.

235
00:13:29.878 --> 00:13:32.087
At that time.
I had multiple of his friends

236
00:13:32.121 --> 00:13:35.055
sleeping on my couch.
peeing on my couch.

237
00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:36.919
Sometimes they would
be sleeping in my shed

238
00:13:36.954 --> 00:13:38.334
or in my yard when I woke up.

239
00:13:38.369 --> 00:13:40.820
Or under the house.
in my crawlspace.

240
00:13:40.854 --> 00:13:44.685
And. like. one time.
Ben literally came in.

241
00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.653
punched a picture
and just shattered it

242
00:13:46.687 --> 00:13:48.828
right in front of me
because he was just so angry.

243
00:13:48.862 --> 00:13:50.346
He did it to the front door.

244
00:13:50.381 --> 00:13:53.073
I just... I felt like he was
spiraling out of control.

245
00:13:54.799 --> 00:13:56.180
Being around
your friends all day.

246
00:13:56.214 --> 00:13:58.147
being a young kid
who's reckless.

247
00:13:58.182 --> 00:14:01.875
you know. that alcohol
gives you that liquid courage.

248
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:05.361
And I'm sure he got that high
from being able

249
00:14:05.396 --> 00:14:07.398
to pull these stunts
and do these things.

250
00:14:07.432 --> 00:14:09.814
But the alcohol definitely
helped him feel like

251
00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:12.058
he can do anything.

252
00:14:12.092 --> 00:14:14.336
-Sad for you right now.
-Sad?

253
00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:15.889
Why do you think that?

254
00:14:15.924 --> 00:14:18.788
-She's kinda dramatic.
-Ben has a drinking problem.

255
00:14:18.823 --> 00:14:21.377
I was writing for
a company called Alliance.

256
00:14:21.412 --> 00:14:23.724
and I remember
the guy called me.

257
00:14:23.759 --> 00:14:27.383
the team manager
and he was like. "We're done."

258
00:14:27.418 --> 00:14:29.247
And I remember
that hitting me and being like.

259
00:14:30.421 --> 00:14:33.631
"Oh. like. I'm not gonna
be a pro surfer."

260
00:14:33.665 --> 00:14:36.013
You were either
super gnarly at 18.

261
00:14:36.047 --> 00:14:38.118
and you were making
the world tour

262
00:14:38.153 --> 00:14:41.984
or winning pro juniors.
or in the magazines.

263
00:14:42.019 --> 00:14:43.744
-I was none of those things.

264
00:14:43.779 --> 00:14:50.027
I was partying in New Jersey
and just lost my sponsor.

265
00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:08.562
-Aw. yeah!
-I broke my leg.

266
00:15:09.149 --> 00:15:10.944
Fuck! Fuck!

267
00:15:11.427 --> 00:15:12.463
Fuck!

268
00:15:12.877 --> 00:15:15.086
Fuck!

269
00:15:15.121 --> 00:15:17.088
I broke my leg!

270
00:15:17.123 --> 00:15:19.194
I woke up probably.
like. at 9:00.

271
00:15:19.228 --> 00:15:21.748
And. instantly.
as I get dressed.

272
00:15:21.782 --> 00:15:24.268
walk outside.
and I see the car go.

273
00:15:24.302 --> 00:15:26.166
and all that happened.
And I just hear him.

274
00:15:26.201 --> 00:15:28.928
Yeah. like.
"Fuck. I broke my leg!"

275
00:15:28.962 --> 00:15:30.584
Fuck!

276
00:15:30.619 --> 00:15:31.931
-Yeah. I did. dude.
-No. you didn't.

277
00:15:31.965 --> 00:15:33.311
-Fuck. yeah. I did!
-Chill. chill. chill.

278
00:15:33.346 --> 00:15:35.141
My knee! My fucking knee. dude!

279
00:15:35.175 --> 00:15:36.245
Fuck. yeah. dude!

280
00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.937
It was completely
out of place. dude.

281
00:15:37.971 --> 00:15:39.283
Yeah. yeah. yeah.
You're not good.

282
00:15:39.317 --> 00:15:41.285
-You're not good. Chill. dude.
-Fuck you! Fuck you!

283
00:15:41.319 --> 00:15:44.046
-No. no. no. Ben. Ben. Ben.
-Chill. dude. Chill.

284
00:15:44.081 --> 00:15:45.806
What do you mean. I'm not good?

285
00:15:45.841 --> 00:15:47.429
-No. Ben.
-I'm fine.

286
00:15:47.463 --> 00:15:49.465
-No. Ben.
-I can feel my leg.

287
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.709
I don't even want to do
this shit anymore though. dude!

288
00:15:51.743 --> 00:15:52.986
It's not worth it. dude.

289
00:15:53.021 --> 00:15:54.643
I had no idea
what was going on.

290
00:15:54.677 --> 00:15:57.059
'Cause. like. you have
that moment of. like.

291
00:15:57.094 --> 00:15:58.267
"There's no way I'm this hurt."

292
00:15:58.302 --> 00:16:00.235
"There's no way...
This can't be real."

293
00:16:00.269 --> 00:16:02.409
It was the worst pain
I've ever been in.

294
00:16:02.444 --> 00:16:05.240
After that. I went into
my brother's house

295
00:16:05.274 --> 00:16:07.794
and I literally just
was drinking.

296
00:16:07.828 --> 00:16:08.968
And I was just
getting drunk like.

297
00:16:09.002 --> 00:16:10.141
"Oh. I'm in
so much fucking pain.

298
00:16:10.176 --> 00:16:11.142
"I gotta drink."

299
00:16:11.177 --> 00:16:14.318
I got drunk. went to sleep.

300
00:16:14.352 --> 00:16:18.322
I like an idiot said. "Don't go
to the emergency room.

301
00:16:18.356 --> 00:16:20.255
"because all they're gonna
do there

302
00:16:20.289 --> 00:16:22.947
"is they're gonna take an X-ay
and give you pain medicine.

303
00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:26.019
"Let's just go to the
orthopedic doctor on Monday."

304
00:16:26.054 --> 00:16:28.194
But they were downplaying
how bad it was.

305
00:16:28.228 --> 00:16:32.129
Apparently. his knee was like
the size of a camera.

306
00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.028
Are you seeing that. dude?

307
00:16:37.203 --> 00:16:39.032
That ain't right. dude.

308
00:16:39.067 --> 00:16:41.207
We went
to Ciccotti's office.

309
00:16:41.241 --> 00:16:44.417
He looked at me and said.
"What would ever make you think

310
00:16:44.451 --> 00:16:47.006
"that you wouldn't take your son
to the emergency room?

311
00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.041
"What is wrong with you?"

312
00:16:49.387 --> 00:16:50.526
He said. "This kid...

313
00:16:50.561 --> 00:16:52.528
"I think this kid's
gonna lose his leg."

314
00:16:52.563 --> 00:16:53.633
Oh. my gosh.

315
00:16:56.532 --> 00:16:58.155
In the doctor's office

316
00:16:58.189 --> 00:17:01.158
at the Rothman Institute
in Philly.

317
00:17:01.192 --> 00:17:04.368
My knee is killing me.
since I haven't taken any Advil

318
00:17:04.402 --> 00:17:06.749
since last night.
like seven o'clock or something.

319
00:17:08.337 --> 00:17:10.477
And I'm just waiting
for the doctor right now.

320
00:17:10.512 --> 00:17:11.616
I got some X-rays.

321
00:17:12.755 --> 00:17:15.758
And I'm pretty much just
in severe pain.

322
00:17:15.793 --> 00:17:17.070
So. looking
at the footage

323
00:17:17.105 --> 00:17:20.211
and seeing how dramatic
the injury was.

324
00:17:20.246 --> 00:17:25.044
and then looking at his knee.
which was quite swollen.

325
00:17:25.078 --> 00:17:27.494
um. that is a serious injury

326
00:17:27.529 --> 00:17:29.910
that needs to be addressed
within hours.

327
00:17:29.945 --> 00:17:33.328
And. if not.
there is a high risk of athletes

328
00:17:33.362 --> 00:17:35.744
losing not only function.

329
00:17:35.778 --> 00:17:39.196
but in some
very tragic situations.

330
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:40.300
losing their limb.

331
00:17:41.922 --> 00:17:43.993
We went out
into the hospital

332
00:17:44.028 --> 00:17:45.064
to get. like. the MRI.

333
00:17:45.098 --> 00:17:46.858
and they prepped me
for surgery.

334
00:17:46.893 --> 00:17:48.377
I remember they were
doing the IV.

335
00:17:48.412 --> 00:17:49.758
they were getting me ready.

336
00:17:49.792 --> 00:17:52.519
And the doctor says
pretty much point blank to me.

337
00:17:52.554 --> 00:17:53.831
"You might lose your leg today.

338
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:58.284
"and you will definitely
never surf again."

339
00:17:58.318 --> 00:18:03.185
And that moment
changed my entire life.

340
00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:06.395
Well. I just was
in the ER for seven hours.

341
00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:08.570
getting tests
on my blood vessels in my legs

342
00:18:08.604 --> 00:18:11.814
to make sure
that they worked properly.

343
00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:15.404
I am thanking God right now.

344
00:18:15.439 --> 00:18:17.441
I can't even believe
how happy I am.

345
00:18:18.373 --> 00:18:20.099
I have three tears in my knee.

346
00:18:21.341 --> 00:18:23.895
Um. I need surgery.

347
00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:27.589
But. oh. my God.
the vessel test is huge for me.

348
00:18:27.623 --> 00:18:30.902
My sense was that
the main ligaments in his knee.

349
00:18:30.937 --> 00:18:33.284
they were okay.
But I had great concern

350
00:18:33.319 --> 00:18:35.252
for what we call
the extensor mechanism.

351
00:18:35.286 --> 00:18:37.392
And that's a series
of structures

352
00:18:37.426 --> 00:18:40.015
that allow us
to actually extend our leg.

353
00:18:40.049 --> 00:18:41.741
And that's why we ended up
getting the MRI.

354
00:18:41.775 --> 00:18:45.986
which did in fact confirm
that he had a complete tear

355
00:18:46.021 --> 00:18:48.092
or rupture
of his patellar tendon.

356
00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:50.750
And I was saying.
"Could it be a meniscus tear?"

357
00:18:50.784 --> 00:18:52.061
"Could it be this?
Could it be that?"

358
00:18:52.096 --> 00:18:53.787
He said. "I think
it's a patellar tendon tear."

359
00:18:53.822 --> 00:18:56.928
and I'm like. "What's worse?"
He said. "Patellar tendon tear."

360
00:18:56.963 --> 00:18:59.828
It's. like. really one of
the worst injuries you can have.

361
00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:14.463
I would say
that Ben's accident.

362
00:19:14.498 --> 00:19:18.226
um. above all else.
was a big wake up call.

363
00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:22.885
And it allowed him to realize
and to appreciate things

364
00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.820
that he didn't before.
which included surfing.

365
00:19:26.855 --> 00:19:28.857
And. like. the fact that

366
00:19:28.891 --> 00:19:32.032
the doctor said
he may never surf again.

367
00:19:32.067 --> 00:19:37.486
really. I think. it scared him
'cause you're gonna lose

368
00:19:37.521 --> 00:19:38.901
the most important thing
in your life.

369
00:19:40.075 --> 00:19:41.835
7:00 a.m.

370
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:45.149
March 6th. 2015. we're at
the Jefferson Surgical Center.

371
00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:47.876
I'm going in to get
my patellar tendon repaired.

372
00:19:49.257 --> 00:19:50.396
Hopefully. everything's good.

373
00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:02.304
I'm waiting for the doctor.

374
00:20:02.339 --> 00:20:03.443
They're gonna give me
a nerve block

375
00:20:03.478 --> 00:20:04.513
and put my leg to sleep.

376
00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:06.170
Put me to sleep.

377
00:20:06.998 --> 00:20:07.896
Repair my...

378
00:20:09.898 --> 00:20:11.037
patellar tendon.

379
00:20:12.245 --> 00:20:13.246
I'm a little nervous.

380
00:20:13.281 --> 00:20:16.249
I've never had
surgery like this.

381
00:20:16.284 --> 00:20:18.355
But that moment kind of brought
everything full circle to me.

382
00:20:18.389 --> 00:20:20.874
I was like.
"Wow. I'm a really lucky person.

383
00:20:20.909 --> 00:20:23.222
"and I'm kind of just taking
everything for granted.

384
00:20:23.256 --> 00:20:24.395
"And now I might
never walk again.

385
00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:26.225
"So I blew it.
I ruined my life."

386
00:20:34.302 --> 00:20:36.890
I get surgery. It's a success.

387
00:20:37.581 --> 00:20:39.065
I'm good.

388
00:20:39.099 --> 00:20:41.240
They're like.
"18 months recovery."

389
00:20:41.999 --> 00:20:44.519
So. that's heavy. Heavy.

390
00:20:44.553 --> 00:20:48.419
I didn't walk
for 40 days after that.

391
00:20:50.559 --> 00:20:51.905
Surfers really
depend upon

392
00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.493
that part of their knee joint.

393
00:20:53.528 --> 00:20:55.150
And to be able to do it
at his level.

394
00:20:55.978 --> 00:20:58.498
ten. maybe 20% chance.

395
00:20:58.533 --> 00:21:01.467
Okay. it's officially
been 12 days since my surgery.

396
00:21:02.468 --> 00:21:04.021
We are getting
in the car right now

397
00:21:04.055 --> 00:21:06.126
to go
to my follow up appointment

398
00:21:06.161 --> 00:21:07.852
to see how everything
is progressing.

399
00:21:07.887 --> 00:21:09.268
get my stitches out.

400
00:21:09.302 --> 00:21:12.581
And I just can't wait
till I can walk

401
00:21:12.616 --> 00:21:16.344
on this thing again. It's gonna
be the best day of my life.

402
00:21:16.378 --> 00:21:18.553
You're gonna witness
a complete and total rebirth.

403
00:21:21.832 --> 00:21:25.318
I was like. "I can't surf.

404
00:21:25.353 --> 00:21:27.527
"I can't do stunts.
I can't walk around.

405
00:21:27.562 --> 00:21:28.770
"I can't do anything exciting.

406
00:21:30.012 --> 00:21:33.119
"But I'm gonna document it
to occupy myself

407
00:21:33.153 --> 00:21:37.261
"and share my experience
with people

408
00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:38.883
"and let them know
what's going on."

409
00:21:38.918 --> 00:21:41.990
So for the first time ever.
I was open.

410
00:21:42.024 --> 00:21:46.063
I was telling the truth.
I was like. "I'm injured.

411
00:21:46.097 --> 00:21:49.584
"I might never be able to do
what I want to do again.

412
00:21:49.618 --> 00:21:51.102
"But this is my life now."

413
00:21:51.137 --> 00:21:52.276
Like. that was the first time

414
00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:53.760
that I was allowing people
to see me.

415
00:21:54.658 --> 00:21:56.418
Like. the real me.

416
00:21:56.453 --> 00:21:58.109
So. that was a powerful thing
for me.

417
00:21:58.144 --> 00:21:59.973
to break down that barrier.

418
00:22:00.008 --> 00:22:01.596
'Cause I really...
There is nothing I cared

419
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:03.770
about at that point.
except for getting better.

420
00:22:03.805 --> 00:22:06.566
So I allowed all of my...

421
00:22:06.601 --> 00:22:10.052
I allowed everything
that I thought in life.

422
00:22:10.087 --> 00:22:12.952
Like. all these perceptions
of me.

423
00:22:12.986 --> 00:22:15.748
anything that I thought
would. like. make me cool.

424
00:22:15.782 --> 00:22:21.201
Any of that stuff. That weird
like. external validation.

425
00:22:21.236 --> 00:22:24.135
I let go of it because
the most important thing for me

426
00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:26.379
was just to be healthy.

427
00:22:26.414 --> 00:22:28.277
And. like. when you
get down that low.

428
00:22:28.312 --> 00:22:31.798
you realize that every minute
that you have

429
00:22:31.833 --> 00:22:34.767
as a healthy human being
is a gift.

430
00:22:34.801 --> 00:22:37.356
Yesterday. I went to the doctor
in King of Prussia

431
00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:40.048
for my second
post operation checkup.

432
00:22:40.082 --> 00:22:43.465
And. uh. he told me I could
ditch my crutches and walk.

433
00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:44.708
I crutched out of there.

434
00:22:44.742 --> 00:22:47.020
but I got home
and I decided to give it a try

435
00:22:47.055 --> 00:22:50.023
and It was actually
a lot easier than I thought.

436
00:22:50.058 --> 00:22:51.991
So. here I am.

437
00:22:52.025 --> 00:22:54.890
He had a script
for physical therapy.

438
00:22:54.925 --> 00:22:58.377
And Ben knew in his head
he was going to do everything

439
00:22:58.411 --> 00:23:00.448
he had to do to get better.

440
00:23:00.482 --> 00:23:03.071
And the doctor told him.
"It's up to you.

441
00:23:03.105 --> 00:23:05.867
"You have to be determined
and do what you need to do."

442
00:23:05.901 --> 00:23:08.421
"We're gonna provide you
with all of the rehab

443
00:23:08.456 --> 00:23:09.836
"that you need.

444
00:23:09.871 --> 00:23:13.184
"Um. but we have to navigate
through the psychological

445
00:23:13.219 --> 00:23:15.773
"and the emotional aspects
of this. too.

446
00:23:15.808 --> 00:23:18.086
"And that that is going
to be a challenge."

447
00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:21.883
But if you have an athlete
that is so highly motivated.

448
00:23:21.917 --> 00:23:24.713
and fearless.
and enthusiastic. like Ben.

449
00:23:24.748 --> 00:23:27.233
uh. those are the things
you can't teach people.

450
00:23:27.267 --> 00:23:30.063
Those are the things
that come in the person.

451
00:23:30.098 --> 00:23:34.516
And those are the intangibles
that make that patient

452
00:23:34.551 --> 00:23:37.381
who is an athlete.
ultimately successful.

453
00:23:38.762 --> 00:23:40.073
He would
do the exercises.

454
00:23:40.108 --> 00:23:41.316
he would push himself.

455
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:43.387
He would come home
and do the exercises.

456
00:23:43.422 --> 00:23:47.460
And even Dr. Ciccotti was like.
"I can't believe it. Ben.

457
00:23:47.495 --> 00:23:51.084
"but you actually
have come so far."

458
00:23:52.741 --> 00:23:56.538
But he also was vlogging
and getting a lot of responses

459
00:23:56.573 --> 00:23:57.746
from people
that were going through

460
00:23:57.781 --> 00:23:59.955
similar experiences
with injuries.

461
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:02.199
And. you know. the fact
that he did go through.

462
00:24:02.233 --> 00:24:03.821
that was an example for a lot
of people that.

463
00:24:03.856 --> 00:24:05.064
"I can do it. too."

464
00:24:05.098 --> 00:24:06.859
'Cause supposedly
a patellar tendon tear

465
00:24:06.893 --> 00:24:08.619
is one of the most
painful injuries ever.

466
00:24:08.654 --> 00:24:10.587
And it's a long road to haul.

467
00:24:10.621 --> 00:24:12.761
But it just goes to show you
Ben's determination

468
00:24:12.796 --> 00:24:14.280
as a human being.

469
00:24:14.314 --> 00:24:16.903
That. "This is what I want.
because surfing is my life.

470
00:24:16.938 --> 00:24:19.009
"And if I lose this.
then I don't know

471
00:24:19.043 --> 00:24:20.873
"what I'm gonna do."

472
00:24:20.907 --> 00:24:22.737
I just kept going.
kept working at it.

473
00:24:22.771 --> 00:24:24.635
And it was just
questions of like.

474
00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:26.879
"Am I gonna be able
to come back?

475
00:24:26.913 --> 00:24:28.259
"Am I gonna be able
to do this?"

476
00:24:28.294 --> 00:24:30.572
And I just worked as hard
as I possibly could.

477
00:24:30.607 --> 00:24:33.472
And I just remember. like.
the day the doctor was like.

478
00:24:34.369 --> 00:24:35.888
"You're good."

479
00:24:35.922 --> 00:24:40.755
So. uh. midway through week ten.
walking pretty good.

480
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:43.309
Still limping. obviously.

481
00:24:43.343 --> 00:24:46.554
And. uh. we're gonna grill
some burgers in the backyard.

482
00:24:46.588 --> 00:24:48.383
have a couple beers
to celebrate.

483
00:24:49.591 --> 00:24:53.526
And. uh. life is good. Honestly.

484
00:24:53.561 --> 00:24:55.528
That's all I can really say.

485
00:24:55.563 --> 00:24:58.151
I was walking again in.
like. August. I think.

486
00:24:58.186 --> 00:25:01.189
or September.
And I started drinking again.

487
00:25:01.223 --> 00:25:05.089
And over that two months.
was just the gnarliest

488
00:25:05.124 --> 00:25:07.367
emotional mental
downhill spiral.

489
00:25:07.402 --> 00:25:08.990
'Cause I had this moment
of elation

490
00:25:09.024 --> 00:25:11.302
and I was like.
"I fixed myself."

491
00:25:11.337 --> 00:25:13.477
You know. I gave myself.
like. a pat on the back.

492
00:25:13.512 --> 00:25:15.721
Let's celebrate.
you know. it's time.

493
00:25:15.755 --> 00:25:18.620
And that's just
the alcoholism in me.

494
00:25:18.655 --> 00:25:21.520
just being like. "This is...
You know. you did it.

495
00:25:21.554 --> 00:25:23.901
"Good job. Have a beer.

496
00:25:23.936 --> 00:25:25.938
"You know. like.
that's what you want."

497
00:25:25.972 --> 00:25:27.422
I got to a point
when I realized

498
00:25:27.456 --> 00:25:28.941
that that's all that I did.

499
00:25:28.975 --> 00:25:30.805
I had already let surfing slip.

500
00:25:30.839 --> 00:25:35.603
I was letting. like. my passion
for video and film slip

501
00:25:35.637 --> 00:25:38.398
and I was accepting that life.

502
00:25:38.433 --> 00:25:43.507
I was accepting just dismal.
horrible existence

503
00:25:43.542 --> 00:25:44.612
where I hated myself.

504
00:25:44.646 --> 00:25:45.992
I'm about to go to this bar.

505
00:25:50.894 --> 00:25:51.964
'Cause why wouldn't I?

506
00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:57.383
When somebody
has reached that threshold

507
00:25:57.417 --> 00:25:59.488
and they have become
physically dependent on it.

508
00:25:59.523 --> 00:26:02.526
it affects your liver enzymes.
it affects your kidneys.

509
00:26:02.561 --> 00:26:04.908
it affects
your basic functioning

510
00:26:04.942 --> 00:26:08.946
in that aspect. physically.
It mostly affects the brain.

511
00:26:08.981 --> 00:26:12.260
The brain becomes
dependent on it chemically.

512
00:26:12.294 --> 00:26:14.331
For those neurons
and endorphins.

513
00:26:14.365 --> 00:26:18.197
Your brain relies
on the substance

514
00:26:18.231 --> 00:26:19.474
to balance itself out.

515
00:26:21.303 --> 00:26:24.203
I end up at Maynard's.
Christmas Eve.

516
00:26:24.237 --> 00:26:28.759
with my younger brother
and I was wasted.

517
00:26:28.794 --> 00:26:31.935
And I got in some
ridiculous argument

518
00:26:31.969 --> 00:26:33.695
with the bartender over nothing.

519
00:26:34.696 --> 00:26:35.904
And she kicked me out.

520
00:26:37.112 --> 00:26:41.082
And I remember I was like.
"Good. fuck you!

521
00:26:41.116 --> 00:26:42.635
"I'm never coming back."

522
00:26:43.774 --> 00:26:48.468
And I woke up the next morning.

523
00:26:49.297 --> 00:26:50.332
and I was like.

524
00:26:52.472 --> 00:26:54.889
"That's the person
that I'm gonna be?

525
00:26:54.923 --> 00:26:56.787
"I'm gonna be that dude

526
00:26:56.822 --> 00:27:00.135
"that gets in the fight
with a bartender."

527
00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:02.828
And I remember the term
that I thought to myself.

528
00:27:02.862 --> 00:27:06.072
I was like. "That's not me."

529
00:27:06.107 --> 00:27:10.283
And I remember. I actually got
a 30 pack for Christmas

530
00:27:10.318 --> 00:27:12.665
from one of my friends.
and I never touched it.

531
00:27:13.701 --> 00:27:15.116
I gave it away.

532
00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:19.292
And I woke up Christmas morning
and that was it.

533
00:27:20.639 --> 00:27:21.536
I was done.

534
00:27:24.953 --> 00:27:26.575
Every decision we make.

535
00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:30.131
big or small. can affect
the rest of our lives.

536
00:27:30.165 --> 00:27:32.340
For Ben.
the choice to quit drinking

537
00:27:32.374 --> 00:27:35.308
was something he felt
he needed for himself.

538
00:27:35.343 --> 00:27:38.380
But little did he know
that making that commitment

539
00:27:38.415 --> 00:27:40.279
would have far greater effects

540
00:27:40.313 --> 00:27:41.901
than he could
have ever imagined.

541
00:27:46.216 --> 00:27:47.355
All right.
Here we go. people.

542
00:27:48.011 --> 00:27:49.737
The time has come.

543
00:27:49.771 --> 00:27:51.670
Been in Florida
for about three hours.

544
00:27:51.704 --> 00:27:54.776
And. uh. we're going surfing.

545
00:27:55.639 --> 00:27:56.433
It's game on.

546
00:27:58.573 --> 00:28:01.472
I got a big ass funboard
that I'm riding.

547
00:28:01.507 --> 00:28:03.716
We're doing it.
I'm stoked right now.

548
00:28:03.751 --> 00:28:05.338
A week into doing my vlogs.

549
00:28:05.373 --> 00:28:08.031
I decided to go down to Florida

550
00:28:08.065 --> 00:28:10.102
and I was gonna surf

551
00:28:10.136 --> 00:28:11.690
for the first time.
I had gotten cleared.

552
00:28:11.724 --> 00:28:14.002
I was allowed to surf
on January 14th.

553
00:28:14.037 --> 00:28:15.970
This is it. people.
We're doing it.

554
00:28:16.764 --> 00:28:19.801
First time surfing. 9 months.

555
00:28:19.836 --> 00:28:22.873
It's like I'm giving birth
to a new Gravy.

556
00:28:22.908 --> 00:28:26.359
I went down and I paddled out
my first day on a fun shape.

557
00:28:27.119 --> 00:28:28.707
And I caught. like. two waves.

558
00:28:28.741 --> 00:28:30.709
and I just. like.
rode down the line.

559
00:28:30.743 --> 00:28:36.369
Like on the smallest. worst.
little Florida crumbly wave.

560
00:28:36.404 --> 00:28:38.924
and it was like
the best wave of my life.

561
00:28:40.546 --> 00:28:43.722
It was the moment
when I was like. "I can do it.

562
00:28:43.756 --> 00:28:45.137
"I'm back in the water.

563
00:28:47.035 --> 00:28:49.141
"From here on out.
I will never take surfing

564
00:28:49.175 --> 00:28:51.350
"for granted. ever again."

565
00:28:51.384 --> 00:28:55.664
It's extremely life-changing.
of course.

566
00:28:55.699 --> 00:28:58.357
because now you have
this clear mind

567
00:28:58.391 --> 00:29:01.498
and you can see things
through a clearer lens.

568
00:29:01.532 --> 00:29:02.879
And it helps you to be

569
00:29:02.913 --> 00:29:06.330
a lot more determined.
a lot more motivated.

570
00:29:06.365 --> 00:29:09.092
Um. it's not without
its challenges.

571
00:29:09.126 --> 00:29:11.163
but it's definitely
more rewarding

572
00:29:11.197 --> 00:29:14.718
when you set your mind to a goal
and you can achieve it

573
00:29:14.753 --> 00:29:17.238
without relying
on something else.

574
00:29:17.272 --> 00:29:18.791
I was planning
on going to Florida

575
00:29:18.826 --> 00:29:21.449
for two weeks. and I ended up
staying down there

576
00:29:21.483 --> 00:29:22.726
for four months

577
00:29:22.761 --> 00:29:24.866
and just literally
just surfing every day.

578
00:29:24.901 --> 00:29:26.592
And just vlogging and surfing.

579
00:29:26.626 --> 00:29:32.356

602
00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:51.435
I went to Sebastian Inlet
one day.

603
00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:53.506
There was a wave breaking
inside the inlet

604
00:30:53.541 --> 00:30:56.855
on the side that usually
people don't surf on.

605
00:31:02.136 --> 00:31:04.345
And I thought it was
the coolest thing. like. ever.

606
00:31:04.379 --> 00:31:06.036
It. like. lit a fire in me.

607
00:31:06.071 --> 00:31:08.970
Dude. that was crazy!

608
00:31:09.005 --> 00:31:11.007
So. that was. like.
close to the end of my trip.

609
00:31:12.387 --> 00:31:15.666
-...who came back.
-And I came home.

610
00:31:15.701 --> 00:31:17.772
I just wanted
to keep the stoke.

611
00:31:17.806 --> 00:31:20.050
I went and I paddled out. like.
on the right side

612
00:31:20.085 --> 00:31:23.674
of the rocks at Skeleton Bay.
and it was small.

613
00:31:23.709 --> 00:31:26.643
But it's these perfect
little laps. like reeling down.

614
00:31:26.677 --> 00:31:29.888
I went out and I put the camera
on the parking lot.

615
00:31:29.922 --> 00:31:33.305
and I just pointed
the camera at the waves.

616
00:31:33.339 --> 00:31:34.720
It was this wide shot.

617
00:31:34.754 --> 00:31:36.722
and I would surf
across the screen.

618
00:31:36.756 --> 00:31:38.275
And then I'd run around
and paddle out.

619
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:39.621
surf across the screen.

620
00:31:39.656 --> 00:31:41.934
So. I put this video up
on my vlog channel.

621
00:31:41.969 --> 00:31:45.455
And it got. like. 12.000 views
in. like. one day.

622
00:31:45.489 --> 00:31:47.871
Before that. my vlogs
were getting like 400 views.

623
00:31:47.906 --> 00:31:51.633
300 views. and it was just
the most random thing.

624
00:31:51.668 --> 00:31:53.359
It just woke me up.

625
00:31:53.394 --> 00:31:55.430
I was like. "This is it."

626
00:31:56.949 --> 00:31:59.710
So. my mission
from that point on.

627
00:31:59.745 --> 00:32:06.303
was to share these waves
that nobody surfs with people.

628
00:32:10.445 --> 00:32:12.447
Well.
there's full blown commitment

629
00:32:12.482 --> 00:32:14.380
and there's being in the zone.

630
00:32:14.415 --> 00:32:17.487
But this right here.
this is something else.

631
00:32:18.212 --> 00:32:20.800
Ben has found his flow.

632
00:32:20.835 --> 00:32:23.148
By allowing
his new positive mindset

633
00:32:23.182 --> 00:32:24.770
to take over his life.

634
00:32:24.804 --> 00:32:27.186
he is now a man
that can do what he loves

635
00:32:27.221 --> 00:32:29.533
without anything
holding him back.

636
00:32:29.568 --> 00:32:31.984
And who would've thought.
novelty waves.

637
00:32:32.019 --> 00:32:33.848
Well. looks like
they love him right back.

638
00:32:33.882 --> 00:32:38.749
Oh. my God.
this is crazy!

639
00:32:53.316 --> 00:32:56.560
A novelty wave is something

640
00:32:56.595 --> 00:33:00.979
that's very rare
and very unique to where

641
00:33:01.013 --> 00:33:04.120
it's not considered a wave
by the general public.

642
00:33:04.154 --> 00:33:05.604
It's only considered a wave

643
00:33:05.638 --> 00:33:07.295
by maybe even
a select few people.

644
00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:08.952
or maybe one person.

645
00:33:08.987 --> 00:33:11.023
And it doesn't happen
all the time.

646
00:33:11.058 --> 00:33:14.199
and it takes specific things
to make it happen.

647
00:33:14.233 --> 00:33:15.338
And that's why it's so special.

648
00:33:21.827 --> 00:33:23.035
All right. guys.
this morning.

649
00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:24.726
I think we know
what's going down.

650
00:33:24.761 --> 00:33:28.040
I am driving down
to the Cape May Ferry.

651
00:33:28.075 --> 00:33:30.249
and I'm going to be riding
this board right here

652
00:33:32.182 --> 00:33:36.324
on the wake behind the ferry
as the ferry docks in the port.

653
00:33:37.739 --> 00:33:39.707
This is something
I've never seen before.

654
00:33:39.741 --> 00:33:41.778
I can't contain my excitement.
I'm freaking out.

655
00:33:41.812 --> 00:33:44.332
But right now I'm gonna
sticker up my shred stick

656
00:33:44.367 --> 00:33:46.817
so all my sponsors
can get some love

657
00:33:46.852 --> 00:33:49.268
when this video goes viral.

658
00:33:54.066 --> 00:33:57.414
In my head.
the ultimate novelty wave was

659
00:33:57.449 --> 00:33:59.106
the Cape May Ferry wave.

660
00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:02.212
Ancient New Jersey
surfing history.

661
00:34:02.247 --> 00:34:05.905
I heard from somebody that
Dean Randazzo had surfed it.

662
00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:07.838
He got arrested
by the state police.

663
00:34:07.873 --> 00:34:09.323
It's like a legend thing.

664
00:34:09.357 --> 00:34:11.221
So I was like.
"That's what I want to do."

665
00:34:11.256 --> 00:34:12.912
I want to surf
the Cape May Ferry wave.

666
00:34:17.883 --> 00:34:20.506
So. I went down there.
I knew nothing about it.

667
00:34:20.541 --> 00:34:22.370
I didn't even know
if there was going to be a wave.

668
00:34:22.405 --> 00:34:23.992
But I knew a ferry
was going to leave.

669
00:34:24.027 --> 00:34:25.994
And I watched it leave.

670
00:34:26.029 --> 00:34:26.926
Look at that.

671
00:34:27.996 --> 00:34:29.550
Jesus.

672
00:34:29.584 --> 00:34:33.105
And I just watched this
two foot left just peel

673
00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:36.902
for like a minute
across the entire bank.

674
00:34:36.936 --> 00:34:40.561
From that moment that I saw
that wave. I had just anxiety.

675
00:34:40.595 --> 00:34:41.838
I needed to surf it.

676
00:34:47.188 --> 00:34:49.087
So I convinced
my girlfriend to come down

677
00:34:49.121 --> 00:34:50.398
and film me surfing
the Ferry wave.

678
00:35:06.828 --> 00:35:07.760
Where is it?

679
00:35:08.865 --> 00:35:10.349
Three ferries came in.

680
00:35:10.384 --> 00:35:14.181
No wave. no wave. no wave.
three failures in a row.

681
00:35:14.215 --> 00:35:16.562
So I'm like. "What's the point?
Like. is this even gonna work?"

682
00:35:16.597 --> 00:35:19.117
I get to thinking
that maybe the boat captain

683
00:35:19.151 --> 00:35:21.429
is slowing down
and shutting off the wave.

684
00:35:21.464 --> 00:35:23.017
So I actually put
a disguise on.

685
00:35:25.468 --> 00:35:27.263
Oh. you have to be crazy!

686
00:35:27.297 --> 00:35:28.574
So. I was sitting
on the rocks.

687
00:35:28.609 --> 00:35:30.231
like. with the fishing pole.
and then. like.

688
00:35:30.266 --> 00:35:31.439
here comes this boat.

689
00:35:31.474 --> 00:35:33.234
As I see the boat going by.
I'm like.

690
00:35:33.269 --> 00:35:35.478
"Okay. the wave's gonna
form up right here."

691
00:35:35.512 --> 00:35:37.307
I can tell it's going
to happen.

692
00:35:37.342 --> 00:35:39.482
So I start ditching
my disguise.

693
00:35:39.516 --> 00:35:42.105
Throw it on the rocks.
and I run out into the water.

694
00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:43.382
I start paddling.

695
00:35:51.218 --> 00:35:53.841
I actually turned around
and caught the wave.

696
00:35:53.875 --> 00:35:55.429
And I got caught behind it.

697
00:35:55.463 --> 00:35:57.845
The actual line.
the breaking line of the wave.

698
00:35:57.879 --> 00:35:59.502
And I felt that the bottom
was really shallow.

699
00:35:59.536 --> 00:36:01.642
So I picked up my board
and i started running.

700
00:36:03.022 --> 00:36:05.715
And I dove back
into the wave that stood up.

701
00:36:07.544 --> 00:36:11.203
♪ I'm trying to show the world
what I can do... ♪

702
00:36:11.238 --> 00:36:15.897
And I got this 45 second
absolute dream ride.

703
00:36:15.932 --> 00:36:18.900
just across the entire bank.
behind the ferry.

704
00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:24.458
♪ I'm trying to show the world
what I can do... ♪

705
00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:41.578
That was ultimate elation.
I actually cried.

706
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:43.891
Yes!

707
00:36:43.925 --> 00:36:47.377
In my head. that was
the moment when It was real.

708
00:36:47.412 --> 00:36:50.518
That moment changed my life
because it was like.

709
00:36:50.553 --> 00:36:54.142
"I fucking surf novelty waves."

710
00:36:59.493 --> 00:37:02.565
His stoke
for those waves
is just who he is.

711
00:37:02.599 --> 00:37:05.568
I mean. he fought so hard.
He has so much joy

712
00:37:05.602 --> 00:37:08.018
and that just comes out
in excitement

713
00:37:08.053 --> 00:37:10.883
over these little novelty waves.
and it's really fun.

714
00:37:10.918 --> 00:37:12.402
He sees the potential in that

715
00:37:12.437 --> 00:37:14.266
where everyone else
will just be like.

716
00:37:14.301 --> 00:37:16.510
"Oh. that's nothing."
Who blow it off
to do something else.

717
00:37:16.544 --> 00:37:18.891
and maybe even complain
that there's no waves that day.

718
00:37:18.926 --> 00:37:20.376
he sees as an opportunity.

719
00:37:31.766 --> 00:37:33.285
I think a lot
of the things

720
00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:35.218
that Ben does in surfing
are overlooked.

721
00:37:35.253 --> 00:37:38.256
Or. like. taken as more
of a joke than it should be

722
00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:40.292
because. like.
he is pretty much genius

723
00:37:40.327 --> 00:37:41.569
with the ideas
that he comes up with.

724
00:37:41.604 --> 00:37:43.399
And a lot of the things
that he's doing.

725
00:37:43.433 --> 00:37:46.402
even if they're not
on a giant scale yet.

726
00:37:46.436 --> 00:37:48.714
are still things
that nobody has ever done.

727
00:37:48.749 --> 00:37:52.856
So little did I know
that that video.

728
00:37:52.891 --> 00:37:55.825
I put it on Instagram
when I got home

729
00:37:55.859 --> 00:38:02.418
and Stab Magazine took it off
my Instagram posted on theirs.

730
00:38:02.452 --> 00:38:05.386
And it went absolutely bonkers.

731
00:38:05.421 --> 00:38:09.597
Every surf website.
every surf instagram account.

732
00:38:09.632 --> 00:38:12.117
everything you could think of.
that wave was on.

733
00:38:12.151 --> 00:38:13.912
That was the turning point
for my channel.

734
00:38:13.946 --> 00:38:16.984
It shows that this is something

735
00:38:17.018 --> 00:38:20.746
that people want to watch.
YouTube and Instagram wise.

736
00:38:20.781 --> 00:38:24.716
that was like a huge moment
in my surfing career because.

737
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:27.166
I mean. I didn't even have
a surfing career before that.

738
00:38:27.201 --> 00:38:30.446
Like.
that was just. like.

739
00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:33.345
a total changing point
in everything.

740
00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:35.623
All right. guys. to be
a professional novelty surfer.

741
00:38:35.658 --> 00:38:38.730
there's a lot of professionalism
and skill involved.

742
00:38:38.764 --> 00:38:40.973
It's not all fun and games.

743
00:38:41.008 --> 00:38:43.251
Oh. wait. Yes. it is.

744
00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:56.023
Once I realized
that you didn't need much swell

745
00:38:56.057 --> 00:38:58.301
for a novelty wave to break.

746
00:38:58.336 --> 00:39:00.855
I started thinking

747
00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:03.858
that I could just go around
to. like. every inlet.

748
00:39:03.893 --> 00:39:06.136
rivers. whatever.

749
00:39:06.171 --> 00:39:08.863
and find just weird
novelty waves.

750
00:39:08.898 --> 00:39:10.451
anything to ride.

751
00:39:10.486 --> 00:39:11.970
It's funny because. like.
you would think

752
00:39:12.004 --> 00:39:14.110
that real waves would make me
want to travel.

753
00:39:14.144 --> 00:39:16.630
but the thing
that got me in the car.

754
00:39:16.664 --> 00:39:19.322
going and searching.
is novelty waves.

755
00:39:23.878 --> 00:39:27.710
Tell us about Ben's
decision to surf 50 states.

756
00:39:27.744 --> 00:39:30.471
I don't even... I can't tell you
anything. 'cause I don't...

757
00:39:30.506 --> 00:39:32.887
d... didn't...

758
00:39:32.922 --> 00:39:36.857
It never registered. like.
what was going on to me.

759
00:39:45.693 --> 00:39:47.730
The first states
that I surfed

760
00:39:47.764 --> 00:39:49.559
were the states
that you would think

761
00:39:49.594 --> 00:39:51.389
that somebody
would be able to surf.

762
00:39:55.531 --> 00:39:58.844
Obviously. New Jersey.
which is my home state.

763
00:39:58.879 --> 00:40:04.091
I surfed the surrounding areas
Maryland. Delaware.

764
00:40:07.784 --> 00:40:10.062
Virginia. North Carolina.

765
00:40:17.138 --> 00:40:19.278
Georgia and Florida.

766
00:40:19.313 --> 00:40:21.626
Um. I took a trip up
to New England

767
00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:25.077
and I surfed New York.
Rhode Island.

768
00:40:26.596 --> 00:40:29.530
Massachusetts.
New Hampshire. Maine.

769
00:40:29.565 --> 00:40:31.601
Even went river surfing
in Vermont.

770
00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:34.811
I had previously surfed Hawaii.

771
00:40:36.606 --> 00:40:39.402
And surfed in Colorado
in a river.

772
00:40:39.437 --> 00:40:44.200
And I drove out to California
and then surfed California.

773
00:40:53.623 --> 00:40:56.212
He's an innovator.
for sure. and surfing 50 states

774
00:40:56.246 --> 00:40:57.834
is a world record.

775
00:40:57.869 --> 00:41:00.112
Like. it's a Guinness book
type of thing.

776
00:41:00.147 --> 00:41:02.287
It's kind of a hard thing
to wrap your head around.

777
00:41:02.321 --> 00:41:04.703
Um. surfing 50 states
doesn't make sense.

778
00:41:04.738 --> 00:41:07.465
People don't understand
surfing in general

779
00:41:07.499 --> 00:41:10.157
and then to put 50 states
on top of that.

780
00:41:10.191 --> 00:41:12.539
I think people
were completely baffled.

781
00:41:12.573 --> 00:41:14.299
Like. anybody can have an idea.

782
00:41:14.333 --> 00:41:16.508
but like going through with it
is totally different.

783
00:41:16.543 --> 00:41:18.993
Like. a lot of people sit around
and talk about

784
00:41:19.028 --> 00:41:20.167
what they're gonna do
with their lives.

785
00:41:20.201 --> 00:41:21.582
But. like. to go out there

786
00:41:21.617 --> 00:41:23.584
and make it happen
is totally different.

787
00:41:23.619 --> 00:41:27.243
I don't care if it's a river.
a lake. a wave pool.

788
00:41:27.277 --> 00:41:31.972
a bayou. the bay. It's surfing.

789
00:41:32.006 --> 00:41:34.077
We're doing it.
we're riding energy.

790
00:41:34.112 --> 00:41:35.562
We're riding a wave.

00:43:59.291 --> 00:44:01.397
I'm obviously in a place
that I have no idea...

838
00:44:01.431 --> 00:44:03.295
I don't know anything
about Missouri.

839
00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:04.227
I've never been there before.

840
00:44:04.952 --> 00:44:06.436
Are you kidding me?

841
00:44:07.852 --> 00:44:10.302
Are you fucking
kidding me?

842
00:44:10.337 --> 00:44:14.099
And I knew that there was a wave
there called the Centaur.

843
00:44:14.134 --> 00:44:17.137
and I knew
that it was big and scary.

844
00:44:17.171 --> 00:44:21.520
I'm gonna get my full suit
and the helmet for protection.

845
00:44:21.555 --> 00:44:23.350
Because this thing
is really raging.

846
00:44:23.384 --> 00:44:27.630
We found one. guys!
We fucking found the Centaur!

847
00:44:27.665 --> 00:44:30.115
There's a lot of warnings.
on the website.

848
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:31.392
like. about the wave.

849
00:44:31.427 --> 00:44:34.257
But I had just conquered
like. four states.

850
00:44:34.292 --> 00:44:36.466
and I'm like.
I'm just going to get a wave

851
00:44:36.501 --> 00:44:39.159
and call it a day.
I'm going to check Missouri off.

852
00:44:39.193 --> 00:44:40.678
and then we're on to Arkansas.

853
00:44:40.712 --> 00:44:42.507
So. I get down
to the edge of the river

854
00:44:42.541 --> 00:44:44.785
and I automatically
had a bad feeling.

855
00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:49.134
All right. guys. the Centaur
looks seriously gnarly.

856
00:44:49.169 --> 00:44:52.759
I wouldn't say I'm exactly hyped
on doing this by myself.

857
00:44:52.793 --> 00:44:57.384
But I at least gotta go try one.
So. let's do this.

858
00:44:57.418 --> 00:45:01.043
When I see the wave.
it's just this big glassy orb

859
00:45:01.077 --> 00:45:02.769
flowing through the river.

860
00:45:02.803 --> 00:45:04.736
And I'm like. okay. cool.

861
00:45:04.771 --> 00:45:07.187
This looks like
I'm gonna ride my seven foot.

862
00:45:07.221 --> 00:45:09.534
In the ocean maybe.
but in a river.

863
00:45:09.568 --> 00:45:11.881
that's the worst idea
you could ever make.

864
00:45:11.916 --> 00:45:13.193
I need to think for a minute.

865
00:45:14.815 --> 00:45:18.854
There's mosquitoes everywhere.
biting me all over my body.

866
00:45:18.888 --> 00:45:21.408
Like. literally. I'm getting
attacked by mosquitoes as I go.

867
00:45:21.442 --> 00:45:23.306
The ground is just mud.

868
00:45:23.341 --> 00:45:25.584
Every step I took.
it went up to my ankle.

869
00:45:25.619 --> 00:45:30.210
The river is hot. sweaty. hot.
and the river's super wide

870
00:45:30.244 --> 00:45:32.626
and just flowing like
the fastest. scariest thing

871
00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:34.248
you've ever seen.

872
00:45:34.283 --> 00:45:37.665
I remember just being like.
"This is a bad idea.

873
00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:38.736
"but I'm doing it."

874
00:45:43.085 --> 00:45:44.051
Wish me luck. guys.

875
00:45:45.812 --> 00:45:48.366
I'm just heading
towards the wave.

876
00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:52.266
And. dude. the river is. like.
all high.

877
00:45:52.301 --> 00:45:54.993
and you can't see the wave
until you get to the ledge.

878
00:45:55.028 --> 00:45:57.030
And from the bank.
this thing looks like

879
00:45:57.064 --> 00:45:58.756
it's about two feet tall.

880
00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:01.103
But when you're in
that river flowing. like.

881
00:46:01.137 --> 00:46:02.863
twenty miles an hour downstream

882
00:46:02.898 --> 00:46:06.004
and you see the wall.
it gets big. real quick.

883
00:46:06.039 --> 00:46:09.214
And I came over the wall
and I just spun around.

884
00:46:09.249 --> 00:46:11.044
Like. I was looking back

885
00:46:11.078 --> 00:46:13.425
and just ready
to catch this wave.

886
00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:14.806
And I remember
getting sucked down

887
00:46:14.841 --> 00:46:16.739
and I just picked up
so much speed.

888
00:46:16.774 --> 00:46:18.120
I went over the wave.

889
00:46:18.154 --> 00:46:20.260
No chance I was catching it.
I was going so fit.

890
00:46:26.645 --> 00:46:29.441
Fighting. getting sucked
under the water. and it. like.

891
00:46:29.476 --> 00:46:30.960
flipped me and rolled me.

892
00:46:30.995 --> 00:46:33.825
and I got rolled upside down
and sucked the nose under.

893
00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:35.309
My legs were sticking up.

894
00:46:35.344 --> 00:46:37.139
and I was literally
holding on for dear life.

895
00:46:37.173 --> 00:46:38.761
And I was like.
I'm about to die

896
00:46:38.796 --> 00:46:40.452
in the middle of Missouri.

897
00:46:40.487 --> 00:46:42.454
surfing a river wave.

898
00:46:44.525 --> 00:46:46.769
I eventually
got out onto. like.

899
00:46:46.804 --> 00:46:49.737
the white foam ball
and pulled myself out

900
00:46:49.772 --> 00:46:53.741
the back of the wave.
and I just like drifted over

901
00:46:53.776 --> 00:46:55.640
to the side of the shoreline.
and I was just like...

902
00:47:00.714 --> 00:47:03.441
I literally
have to call it. dude.

903
00:47:03.475 --> 00:47:04.960
I can't risk my life.

904
00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:08.446
Fucking bumming. dude.

905
00:47:10.068 --> 00:47:12.312
Literally. that thing
took me under.

906
00:47:12.346 --> 00:47:13.865
flipped me upside down.

907
00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:15.522
I tweaked my back so bad.

908
00:47:15.556 --> 00:47:16.695
if I wasn't holding
on to my board.

909
00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:18.697
I probably would've just died.

910
00:47:18.732 --> 00:47:20.147
I just held on to my board

911
00:47:20.182 --> 00:47:23.668
and went up. It was holding me
back behind the waterfall

912
00:47:23.702 --> 00:47:26.084
and then finally let me go
when I wriggled out of it.

913
00:47:31.641 --> 00:47:34.472
I literally was in shock.
and I didn't realize.

914
00:47:34.506 --> 00:47:35.749
After that. I went back

915
00:47:36.232 --> 00:47:37.371
to my hotel

916
00:47:37.406 --> 00:47:38.856
I went to sleep for the night.

917
00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:40.719
Edited my video like normal

918
00:47:40.754 --> 00:47:42.238
I woke up the next morning.

919
00:47:42.273 --> 00:47:43.377
Good morning. guys.

920
00:47:43.412 --> 00:47:44.965
We are in Missouri. still.

921
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.242
And I'm not gonna lie.

922
00:47:46.277 --> 00:47:48.210
yesterday really took
the wind out of my sails.

923
00:47:50.108 --> 00:47:51.075
And...

924
00:47:52.697 --> 00:47:53.974
Questioning the journey.

925
00:47:54.009 --> 00:47:57.288
I couldn't drive the car west.

926
00:47:57.322 --> 00:47:58.358
Any further west.

927
00:47:58.392 --> 00:47:59.877
I. like. had a mental block.

928
00:47:59.911 --> 00:48:01.292
Like. I couldn't make
a right-hand turn

929
00:48:01.326 --> 00:48:02.810
out of the hotel

930
00:48:02.845 --> 00:48:04.088
to go to Arkansas.

931
00:48:04.122 --> 00:48:05.158
Like. I was done.

932
00:48:05.192 --> 00:48:06.849
And I just broke down crying.

933
00:48:06.884 --> 00:48:08.886
I'm so stressed out.

934
00:48:12.096 --> 00:48:13.476
'Cause I don't know what to do.

935
00:48:13.511 --> 00:48:15.720
I don t want to be here anymore.

936
00:48:16.617 --> 00:48:18.171
I had kayakers hit me up online.

937
00:48:18.205 --> 00:48:19.551
Like. "Yo. you almost died."

938
00:48:19.586 --> 00:48:21.622
Like. "That hydraulic's gnarly.
People die there."

939
00:48:21.657 --> 00:48:22.865
I go online. I looked up

940
00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:24.867
there's four deaths
at that spot.

941
00:48:24.902 --> 00:48:26.938
Four people have died there.

942
00:48:26.973 --> 00:48:29.907
Okay. guys. I've never
had this before.

943
00:48:29.941 --> 00:48:31.874
I don't know
what's going on. but

944
00:48:31.909 --> 00:48:33.600
I would imagine that this is

945
00:48:34.463 --> 00:48:36.983
a panic attack. Um.

946
00:48:37.017 --> 00:48:39.709
I'm having severe anxiety.

947
00:48:39.744 --> 00:48:40.572
Um...

948
00:48:41.988 --> 00:48:44.404
Very confusing. tripped out.

949
00:48:44.438 --> 00:48:45.405
And. uh.

950
00:48:46.302 --> 00:48:48.063
I just. I got to get home.

951
00:48:48.097 --> 00:48:50.548
So I'm pulling the plug.

952
00:48:50.582 --> 00:48:52.170
And this is real.
Yes. this is real.

953
00:48:52.205 --> 00:48:53.758
I'm really pulling the plug.

954
00:48:53.792 --> 00:48:56.002
I'm getting on 64 East right now

955
00:48:56.036 --> 00:48:57.589
and then I'm just gonna
start trucking home.

956
00:48:57.624 --> 00:49:00.420
So that's what I'm doing.

957
00:49:02.974 --> 00:49:03.975
That's what I'm doing.

958
00:49:04.976 --> 00:49:06.598
When you're as driven as Ben

959
00:49:06.633 --> 00:49:07.979
and you have these goals

960
00:49:08.014 --> 00:49:09.912
and you have an expectation.

961
00:49:09.947 --> 00:49:11.949
and sometimes it can't
always be met.

962
00:49:11.983 --> 00:49:14.917
there is. like. this
significant feeling of

963
00:49:14.952 --> 00:49:16.988
letdown and pressure.

964
00:49:17.023 --> 00:49:19.232
And so it's hard to. kind of.

965
00:49:19.266 --> 00:49:21.234
not use substances
to cope with that

966
00:49:21.268 --> 00:49:22.752
emotional pain.

967
00:49:22.787 --> 00:49:23.961
No way.

968
00:49:25.341 --> 00:49:26.411
I'm home.

969
00:49:34.523 --> 00:49:35.627
Dude.

970
00:49:36.835 --> 00:49:38.699
I don't care who you are.

971
00:49:39.735 --> 00:49:41.254
how much money you make.

972
00:49:43.808 --> 00:49:44.705
what you do.

973
00:49:45.499 --> 00:49:47.329
how big of a person you are.

974
00:49:48.709 --> 00:49:50.539
sometimes you just need

975
00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:52.196
to be home.

976
00:49:55.509 --> 00:49:57.201
It's not like I came out of that
and I was. like.

977
00:49:57.235 --> 00:49:58.340
"All right. I'm gonna go drink."

978
00:49:58.374 --> 00:50:00.100
But I definitely thought
about it.

979
00:50:00.687 --> 00:50:01.550
For sure.

980
00:50:03.207 --> 00:50:04.656
Stuff like that.

981
00:50:04.691 --> 00:50:07.349
is what makes you question

982
00:50:08.453 --> 00:50:10.283
your situation.

983
00:50:10.317 --> 00:50:13.424
And in a scenario like that.

984
00:50:13.458 --> 00:50:15.667
it would be a whole lot easier

985
00:50:15.702 --> 00:50:17.704
to just drown your sorrows

986
00:50:17.738 --> 00:50:19.119
with a beer

987
00:50:19.154 --> 00:50:22.226
than it would be
to face the problem head on.

988
00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:24.021
and deal with that emotionally.

989
00:50:33.513 --> 00:50:39.070
I had no idea if I even wanted
to continue surfing
the 50 states.

990
00:50:39.105 --> 00:50:41.797
I think he needed
to focus on the things he loved.

991
00:50:41.831 --> 00:50:44.248
I think he needed
to focus on himself again.

992
00:50:44.282 --> 00:50:47.182
Focus on his family.
his friends.

993
00:50:47.216 --> 00:50:48.321
surfing for fun.

994
00:50:48.355 --> 00:50:50.012
I think he had to get back to

995
00:50:50.047 --> 00:50:52.394
the reason why he was doing
what he was doing

996
00:50:52.428 --> 00:50:54.913
because he was so caught up
in this goal.

997
00:51:00.091 --> 00:51:01.472
It's kind of a funny story

998
00:51:01.506 --> 00:51:03.301
because it's not your
conventional. like. "We met".

999
00:51:03.336 --> 00:51:05.338
Just. I guess. most people
meet at a bar

1000
00:51:05.372 --> 00:51:07.064
or meet at school or something.

1001
00:51:07.098 --> 00:51:08.720
We met through Instagram.

1002
00:51:08.755 --> 00:51:10.481
One day. just commenting
on Instagram.

1003
00:51:10.515 --> 00:51:12.138
and I tagged my friend
in a shirt that said.

1004
00:51:12.172 --> 00:51:13.725
"Drinking coffee
and talking shit"

1005
00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:16.383
And I was. like.
"Oh. my God.
we need these T-shirts."

1006
00:51:16.418 --> 00:51:18.765
Not thinking it was
Ben's Instagram.

1007
00:51:18.799 --> 00:51:21.319
So. I commented on there.

1008
00:51:21.354 --> 00:51:23.252
And then. like. I guess.
a couple of hours later.

1009
00:51:23.287 --> 00:51:26.635
I got a DM. a direct message
from Ben.

1010
00:51:26.669 --> 00:51:30.052
So I clicked it. and I was like.
"Damn. dude."

1011
00:51:30.087 --> 00:51:32.227
I literally. like.
fell in love. like.

1012
00:51:32.261 --> 00:51:34.436
right when I saw her Instagram.

1013
00:51:34.470 --> 00:51:35.609
I don't know.

1014
00:51:35.644 --> 00:51:36.990
Dude. I never do this.

1015
00:51:37.024 --> 00:51:38.957
And I just went. like.
"Bam". Right. DM.

1016
00:51:38.992 --> 00:51:39.924
Like.

1017
00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:42.133
"Do you want a shirt?"

1018
00:51:42.168 --> 00:51:43.962
Or something like that.
I don't know what I said.

1019
00:51:43.997 --> 00:51:46.241
I was. like.
"I could totally get you a shirt

1020
00:51:46.275 --> 00:51:48.519
and you don't
have to pay for it."

1021
00:51:48.553 --> 00:51:52.350
So. couple clever remarks later.
we hung out

1022
00:51:52.385 --> 00:51:54.145
and we went
and got coffee together

1023
00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:56.906
Pretty much. like. the moment
that I met her.

1024
00:51:56.941 --> 00:51:59.323
from then on. it was just. like.
I just kind of knew.

1025
00:52:04.811 --> 00:52:06.399
Our relationship was pretty new

1026
00:52:06.433 --> 00:52:08.401
when I started surfing
the 50 states

1027
00:52:08.435 --> 00:52:10.679
and she would just
be tripped out because. like.

1028
00:52:11.438 --> 00:52:13.268
her vision of

1029
00:52:13.302 --> 00:52:15.097
a boyfriend is someone
that's home.

1030
00:52:15.132 --> 00:52:16.616
That they spend time with.

1031
00:52:16.650 --> 00:52:19.550
And. like. here she has me.

1032
00:52:19.584 --> 00:52:22.794
And I'm driving around
the country by myself. so...

1033
00:52:22.829 --> 00:52:25.176
"By myself" puts me
in a bad category

1034
00:52:25.211 --> 00:52:27.316
'cause it's. like.
"He's so insane

1035
00:52:27.351 --> 00:52:29.180
that nobody will
even go with him."

1036
00:52:29.215 --> 00:52:31.182
She didn't get what
I was doing at all.

1037
00:52:31.217 --> 00:52:33.943
And she always tried her
hardest to support me.

1038
00:52:33.978 --> 00:52:36.187
So our relationship's
just. like.

1039
00:52:36.222 --> 00:52:37.084
pretty magic.

1040
00:52:38.638 --> 00:52:42.262
Really what I was
searching for in other people.

1041
00:52:42.297 --> 00:52:43.781
or other relationships

1042
00:52:43.815 --> 00:52:46.887
that I thought of were
boyfriends in my mind.

1043
00:52:46.922 --> 00:52:48.855
they were people
that were hard-working.

1044
00:52:48.889 --> 00:52:50.339
that were determined.

1045
00:52:50.374 --> 00:52:51.996
that never gave up.

1046
00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:53.860
And I found that in Ben.

1047
00:52:53.894 --> 00:52:56.345
Together. we have done
unconventional things.

1048
00:52:56.380 --> 00:53:00.038
And. you know.
it's more exciting
than I could ever imagine.

1049
00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:28.032
No way.

1050
00:53:28.722 --> 00:53:29.585
No way.

1051
00:53:30.276 --> 00:53:31.898
No way!

1052
00:53:31.932 --> 00:53:33.796
No way!

1053
00:53:34.245 --> 00:53:35.419
No way!

1054
00:53:35.902 --> 00:53:37.352
Oh. my god!

1055
00:53:37.386 --> 00:53:39.595
Are you kidding me?

1056
00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:42.357
Are you kidding me?

1057
00:53:43.116 --> 00:53:45.049
Wave Bandit

1058
00:53:45.083 --> 00:53:46.878
Ben Gravy Pro Model.

1059
00:53:46.913 --> 00:53:48.535
Look at that shiny sticker.

1060
00:53:49.536 --> 00:53:51.676
Oh. my god!

1061
00:53:52.574 --> 00:53:53.954
Are you kidding me?

1062
00:53:53.989 --> 00:53:55.577
Thank you. guys. so much.

1063
00:53:55.611 --> 00:53:57.130
Look at this surfboard.

1064
00:53:57.164 --> 00:53:58.683
It's real. It's real.

1065
00:53:58.718 --> 00:54:01.203
This is the coolest thing
I've seen in my entire life.

1066
00:54:01.238 --> 00:54:02.687
Thank you for everything.

1067
00:54:02.722 --> 00:54:03.861
Thank you! Thank you!

1068
00:54:03.895 --> 00:54:06.588
And the eight-footer.
The eight-footer!

1069
00:54:06.622 --> 00:54:07.968
Are you kidding me?

1070
00:54:08.003 --> 00:54:09.107
The eight-footer?

1071
00:54:09.142 --> 00:54:10.247
Are you kidding me?

1072
00:54:10.281 --> 00:54:11.938
The eight-footer?

1073
00:54:11.972 --> 00:54:14.768
To be semi-pro is

1074
00:54:15.735 --> 00:54:19.152
to just be yourself.

1075
00:54:19.186 --> 00:54:24.122
The reality of my life is that
I was never
gonna be a pro surfer.

1076
00:54:24.157 --> 00:54:27.747
My entire career is an anomaly.

1077
00:54:28.610 --> 00:54:30.370
It happened by accident.

1078
00:54:30.405 --> 00:54:32.648
I didn't come up through
any structured

1079
00:54:33.649 --> 00:54:35.824
industry of surfing.

1080
00:54:35.858 --> 00:54:40.691
So I think it's hilarious
to call myself a semi-pro

1081
00:54:40.725 --> 00:54:43.694
because that's what
I feel like I am.

1082
00:54:43.728 --> 00:54:46.628
'Cause I'm never going to be
better than anybody else. dude.

1083
00:54:46.662 --> 00:54:50.045
I'm just straight up
a total kook.

1084
00:54:51.322 --> 00:54:52.668
I don't really know
how to explain it.

1085
00:54:52.703 --> 00:54:54.567
but. like. they can
have it. dude.

1086
00:54:54.601 --> 00:54:57.259
Pro? I don't need a title.

1087
00:54:57.294 --> 00:54:58.916
Like. I'm just a guy. dude.

1088
00:54:59.848 --> 00:55:01.401
I'm just a semi-pro.

1089
00:55:04.231 --> 00:55:07.338
I have something
very special in me.

1090
00:55:07.373 --> 00:55:08.546
When I was two years old.

1091
00:55:08.581 --> 00:55:11.169
I was diagnosed with
high-functioning autism.

1092
00:55:11.204 --> 00:55:13.827
So over the course of my
adolescence and teenage years.

1093
00:55:14.863 --> 00:55:16.347
I had a lot of trouble.

1094
00:55:16.382 --> 00:55:19.454
you know. to try and find some
sort of identity for myself

1095
00:55:19.488 --> 00:55:21.421
And then. of course.
when Ben came along

1096
00:55:21.456 --> 00:55:23.009
and introduced me to surfing.

1097
00:55:23.043 --> 00:55:26.012
you know. I found my true
purpose and identity.

1098
00:55:26.046 --> 00:55:28.601
It's uncertain. but all I know
is that just like Ben.

1099
00:55:28.635 --> 00:55:30.465
I'm going to live
the stoke life.

1100
00:55:30.499 --> 00:55:32.018
I'm living the sober life.

1101
00:55:32.052 --> 00:55:33.571
And. because of him.

1102
00:55:33.606 --> 00:55:35.228
I wouldn't be
sitting here today.

1103
00:55:35.262 --> 00:55:37.334
There's a lot of things I'd like
to be thankful to Ben.

1104
00:55:37.368 --> 00:55:38.956
but the biggest thing
I would like to say.

1105
00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:41.855
"Thanks. Ben. for being
an excellent friend."

1106
00:55:47.930 --> 00:55:49.760
JAMIE:
Ben is a really good influence

1107
00:55:49.794 --> 00:55:51.762
on a lot of people
around the world.

1108
00:55:51.796 --> 00:55:53.384
He's out there showing you

1109
00:55:53.419 --> 00:55:55.455
that you don't
have to be a pro surfer.

1110
00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:59.183
You just got to go out there
and have as much fun
as you can. you know?

1111
00:55:59.217 --> 00:56:00.598
I think he just
laid it out there

1112
00:56:00.633 --> 00:56:02.980
and said. "I'm Ben Gravy.
I'm semi-pro."

1113
00:56:03.014 --> 00:56:03.912
Yo!

1114
00:56:08.123 --> 00:56:09.158
Look here. guys.

1115
00:56:16.269 --> 00:56:20.169
For young kids. Ben's. like.
an incredible person.
awesome role model.

1116
00:56:20.204 --> 00:56:23.207
And if you were to ask me that
10 years ago.

1117
00:56:23.241 --> 00:56:26.383
about Ben being a role model
for young kids.

1118
00:56:26.417 --> 00:56:27.936
that would be the last thing
I would think of.

1119
00:56:27.970 --> 00:56:31.008
I would say.
"Anything he does. don't do."

1120
00:56:31.042 --> 00:56:33.700
But now. it's a complete 180.

1121
00:56:44.159 --> 00:56:45.747
JAMIE O'BRIEN:
And he claims semi-pro.

1122
00:56:45.781 --> 00:56:47.542
It's amazing.

1123
00:56:47.576 --> 00:56:50.855
Like. this guy's
grabbed everything
and just put it out there.

1124
00:56:50.890 --> 00:56:52.547
You know. he's got
an awesome following.

1125
00:56:52.581 --> 00:56:53.927
He's. like...
Everyone loves him.

1126
00:56:53.962 --> 00:56:56.723
I mean. Ben's living the dream
and he made it happen.

1127
00:56:56.758 --> 00:56:58.967
And that's the best part
about Ben.

1128
00:57:09.598 --> 00:57:11.945
I feel like out there. there's
only a certain amount of people

1129
00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:14.396
that could be a pro surfer.
and it's hard to relate.

1130
00:57:14.431 --> 00:57:17.710
Ben's a semi-pro.
I think everyone's a semi-pro.

1131
00:57:17.744 --> 00:57:19.539
And it's just like
putting a stamp like.

1132
00:57:19.574 --> 00:57:22.300
"I'm not a pro surfer.
But. hey. I'm having
the time of my life."

1133
00:57:22.335 --> 00:57:24.820
And he created this whole
industry around him.

1134
00:57:24.855 --> 00:57:27.409
You know. he's got killer
sponsors now.

1135
00:57:27.444 --> 00:57:29.825
He's like the forefront
of Wave Bandit.

1136
00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:32.241
He is the king of vlogging
and surfing.

1137
00:57:32.276 --> 00:57:34.312
And there is so much
respect for him.

1138
00:57:34.347 --> 00:57:36.073
And I just feel like
Ben had a dream

1139
00:57:36.107 --> 00:57:38.316
and had a vision
of what he wanted to do

1140
00:57:38.351 --> 00:57:39.835
and what he wanted
to accomplish.

1141
00:57:43.114 --> 00:57:44.391
Positive outlook on life.

1142
00:57:44.426 --> 00:57:46.842
whether you're a kid
or 80 years old.

1143
00:57:46.877 --> 00:57:50.363
it's something that you could
definitely use as a role model.
for sure.

1144
00:57:53.228 --> 00:57:56.334
I took a long time off
after that.
A while.

1145
00:57:57.059 --> 00:57:57.922
And. uh...

1146
00:57:58.889 --> 00:58:00.442
it took me...

1147
00:58:00.477 --> 00:58:02.789
You know. that moment.

1148
00:58:02.824 --> 00:58:05.309
was kind of like
the commitment moment.

1149
00:58:05.343 --> 00:58:07.656
It was. like.
are you gonna do this?

1150
00:58:08.485 --> 00:58:09.313
Or...

1151
00:58:10.935 --> 00:58:11.971
was it just kind of a joke?

1152
00:58:12.005 --> 00:58:14.007
You're gonna just let it go?

1153
00:58:14.042 --> 00:58:16.113
And I decided
that I was gonna do it.

1154
00:58:22.982 --> 00:58:24.397
At the car dealership right now.

1155
00:58:28.194 --> 00:58:29.333
As you may have guessed.

1156
00:58:29.367 --> 00:58:33.510
I have the Dodge ProMaster
for the dream.

1157
00:58:33.544 --> 00:58:34.649
I am so stoked.

1158
00:58:34.683 --> 00:58:39.136
The 2017
Dodge Semi-ProMaster.

1159
00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:41.207
I hope you guys
are as excited as I am.

1160
00:58:41.241 --> 00:58:43.934
I'm going to renovate
this thing. Make it the ultimate

1161
00:58:43.968 --> 00:58:45.556
road trip mobile.

1162
00:58:45.591 --> 00:58:47.178
And drive it across the country.

1163
00:58:47.938 --> 00:58:49.940
Good morning. Nub Nation.

1164
00:58:51.217 --> 00:58:53.840
I'm starting off today
with a socket thing.

1165
00:59:06.784 --> 00:59:09.649
In the past couple of years.
he's definitely made it.
like. a thing

1166
00:59:09.684 --> 00:59:11.202
to hunt out these novelties.

1167
00:59:11.237 --> 00:59:12.790
But even when he was younger.

1168
00:59:12.825 --> 00:59:14.965
I think. like. without trying.

1169
00:59:14.999 --> 00:59:16.691
he was always kind of hunting

1170
00:59:16.725 --> 00:59:19.694
little novelty waves
and surfing spots that

1171
00:59:19.728 --> 00:59:22.179
a lot of other people
didn't surf.

1172
00:59:22.213 --> 00:59:24.837
We're talking about
a finished floor. people.

1173
00:59:24.871 --> 00:59:26.252
I guess
the best way I can describe

1174
00:59:26.286 --> 00:59:28.772
Ben Gravy
in the surf industry is

1175
00:59:28.806 --> 00:59:31.533
hard work.
head down. grinding.

1176
00:59:31.568 --> 00:59:33.777
Whatever it is.
he's working every day.

1177
00:59:33.811 --> 00:59:35.675
His mind is not even
thinking it's work. you know?

1178
00:59:35.710 --> 00:59:37.263
This is. like. the way
that he operates.

1179
00:59:37.297 --> 00:59:39.506
He just wakes up
and he wants to make videos.

1180
00:59:39.541 --> 00:59:40.922
and he wants
to document his life.

1181
00:59:40.956 --> 00:59:43.062
And I think
it's really hardcore.

1182
00:59:43.096 --> 00:59:45.029
BEN:
All right. ladies and gentlemen.

1183
00:59:45.064 --> 00:59:46.962
Walls. Ceilings.

1184
00:59:47.791 --> 00:59:49.206
Cabinets.

1185
00:59:50.517 --> 00:59:52.623
Look at this storage space.

1186
00:59:52.658 --> 00:59:54.004
I'm tripping.

1187
00:59:54.038 --> 00:59:55.522
Unreal. It's unreal.

1188
00:59:55.557 --> 00:59:58.008
What's the most
attractive to me

1189
00:59:58.042 --> 01:00:00.700
is just his. like. drive
and determination.

1190
01:00:00.735 --> 01:00:02.529
He just goes and goes and goes.

1191
01:00:02.564 --> 01:00:03.945
And I just.

1192
01:00:03.979 --> 01:00:06.223
I just can't believe it.
Ben just doesn't give up.

1193
01:00:06.257 --> 01:00:07.604
And I've seen him

1194
01:00:07.638 --> 01:00:11.090
so many times. like. fail
in these past three years.

1195
01:00:11.124 --> 01:00:14.714
And. like. hard failures
where he was just beaten

1196
01:00:14.749 --> 01:00:16.992
and he didn't know what
he was gonna do next.

1197
01:00:17.027 --> 01:00:18.891
And he's. like. "I can't
believe this has happened."

1198
01:00:18.925 --> 01:00:21.548
Or. "I can't believe
I'm here again." And...

1199
01:00:22.584 --> 01:00:23.758
He just still didn't give up.

1200
01:00:31.835 --> 01:00:33.008
Put it on wax.

1201
01:00:33.043 --> 01:00:33.975
That's it.

1202
01:00:35.217 --> 01:00:36.149
We're done.

1203
01:00:36.184 --> 01:00:37.116
Dude. we're done.

1204
01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:38.082
We're done.

1205
01:00:38.876 --> 01:00:40.567
Was Ben's journey

1206
01:00:40.602 --> 01:00:44.571
to surf the 50 states
an accident
or was it his destiny?

1207
01:00:44.606 --> 01:00:46.746
The universe was lining up
for Ben.

1208
01:00:46.781 --> 01:00:50.647
His commitment to sobriety
and his love to surf
all the time.

1209
01:00:50.681 --> 01:00:53.408
anywhere he could.
was about to lead him

1210
01:00:53.442 --> 01:00:56.169
on one of the wildest rides
of his life.

1211
01:00:58.482 --> 01:01:01.174
Instead of going out
and just
checking off the states.

1212
01:01:01.209 --> 01:01:04.937
it was really important for me
to experience the journey.

1213
01:01:04.971 --> 01:01:09.493
And. yeah. with all those
big storms
coming across the country

1214
01:01:09.527 --> 01:01:11.184
and hitting us on the coast.

1215
01:01:11.219 --> 01:01:13.980
there was a lot of extra
activity that year.

1216
01:01:14.015 --> 01:01:17.052
And I felt like I could finish
what I started.

1217
01:01:17.087 --> 01:01:19.710
At least in the Great Lakes.

1218
01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:54.711
My wetsuit won't unzip.

1219
01:01:54.745 --> 01:01:56.851
Fully frozen shut.

1220
01:02:16.802 --> 01:02:17.872
Ohio!

1221
01:03:00.293 --> 01:03:01.501
What's going on out there?

1222
01:03:02.848 --> 01:03:04.090
Fun. Cleaning off.

1223
01:03:04.988 --> 01:03:06.334
Having a lot of fun out there.

1224
01:03:07.162 --> 01:03:08.543
Ben Gravy's killing it.

1225
01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:13.134
The people out there
are definitely

1226
01:03:13.168 --> 01:03:17.448
some of the most stoked people
in surfing.

1227
01:03:17.483 --> 01:03:21.211
And I guess. just because
the lakes don't get
waves all year round.

1228
01:03:21.245 --> 01:03:24.076
they kind of only
have a specific season.

1229
01:03:24.110 --> 01:03:26.595
The surfers out there
get really. really stoked.

1230
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:29.771
It's just something really cool
to be a part of and witness.

1231
01:03:55.901 --> 01:03:58.489
Once I checked off
all of the states

1232
01:03:58.524 --> 01:04:00.181
surrounding the Great Lakes.

1233
01:04:00.215 --> 01:04:03.115
I knew that I could finish
the 50 states.

1234
01:04:03.149 --> 01:04:06.049
I had the entire Nub Nation
counting on me.

1235
01:04:06.083 --> 01:04:08.327
And the whole world
was watching.

1236
01:04:21.547 --> 01:04:22.997
Oh. my God. this is
the gnarliest thing.

1237
01:04:23.929 --> 01:04:25.896
We're here.

1238
01:04:25.931 --> 01:04:27.484
There's a wave.

1239
01:04:27.518 --> 01:04:30.038
There is a wave
right there. Hob.

1240
01:04:30.073 --> 01:04:31.177
Right there.

1241
01:04:31.212 --> 01:04:33.731
We did it. dude.
We fucking did it. Hob!

1242
01:04:33.766 --> 01:04:34.871
We did it!

1243
01:04:48.505 --> 01:04:50.334
So that little thing
holds as much stoke

1244
01:04:50.369 --> 01:04:52.750
as a 20-foot wave. in my head.

1245
01:04:52.785 --> 01:04:53.890
'Cause the journey.

1246
01:04:53.924 --> 01:04:55.477
The being in the middle
of nowhere.

1247
01:04:55.512 --> 01:04:57.548
Just finding this place.
We got to surf this

1248
01:04:57.583 --> 01:04:58.722
and then there's
another peak. dude.

1249
01:04:58.756 --> 01:05:00.103
It's on out here. boys.

1250
01:05:05.591 --> 01:05:07.696
Well. I think this is gonna
be pretty exciting for you.

1251
01:05:16.498 --> 01:05:18.880
We're here
in Oklahoma City. and

1252
01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:20.502
apparently. we can surf
one of these waves

1253
01:05:20.537 --> 01:05:21.918
that's part
of the whitewater run.

1254
01:05:21.952 --> 01:05:23.816
It's gonna be pretty gnarly.
but we're on it.

1255
01:05:31.997 --> 01:05:33.446
Dude. this is so sick.

1256
01:06:34.887 --> 01:06:37.717
Whoo! Montana!

1257
01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:58.842
The boys are crashing out
at the nature preserve.

1258
01:06:58.876 --> 01:07:01.396
Hour forty-five away
from the surf spot.

1259
01:07:16.963 --> 01:07:20.381
My final claim.
Stoked. Fully stoked.

1260
01:07:20.415 --> 01:07:21.416
Yeah.

1261
01:07:21.451 --> 01:07:23.694
Glad to meet ya. For the dream!

1262
01:07:23.729 --> 01:07:24.557
You're the man.

1263
01:07:44.957 --> 01:07:47.891
I bought
this new sleeping bag.

1264
01:07:47.925 --> 01:07:52.516
and it's supposed to be
a 20 degrees sleeping bag.

1265
01:07:52.551 --> 01:07:55.416
So I am supposed to be able
to get down to 20 degrees

1266
01:07:56.210 --> 01:07:57.590
with that.

1267
01:07:57.625 --> 01:07:58.936
And I have another blanket

1268
01:07:58.971 --> 01:08:00.593
I'm gonna put on top of that.

1269
01:08:00.628 --> 01:08:04.080
I got my back curtains closed
to keep heat in.

1270
01:08:04.666 --> 01:08:05.978
That's really it.

1271
01:08:06.012 --> 01:08:07.497
I'm about to tuck in
and hit the sack.

1272
01:08:08.567 --> 01:08:09.913
Getting up early to surf.

1273
01:08:09.947 --> 01:08:11.639
I just want to say.
thank you guys for everything.

1274
01:08:12.295 --> 01:08:13.572
Super fun day

1275
01:08:13.606 --> 01:08:14.849
And. uh...

1276
01:08:14.883 --> 01:08:16.092
the dream keeps moving forward

1277
01:08:16.126 --> 01:08:17.541
So thank you. guys.

1278
01:08:17.576 --> 01:08:18.818
Nub Nation for the win.

1279
01:08:18.853 --> 01:08:21.890
And. as always.
just keep it positive.

1280
01:08:21.925 --> 01:08:24.203
And keep pushing for the things
that you believe in

1281
01:08:24.238 --> 01:08:25.515
and the things
that you want in life.

1282
01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:28.034
Because. uh.

1283
01:08:28.069 --> 01:08:30.244
they are attainable
through hard work.

1284
01:08:31.314 --> 01:08:32.901
Good night.

1285
01:08:32.936 --> 01:08:34.144
I'll see you guys
in the morning.

1286
01:08:34.179 --> 01:08:35.249
For the dream.

1287
01:08:43.153 --> 01:08:44.982
Dude. there's one option.

1288
01:08:45.017 --> 01:08:46.639
This option is not
looking good. dude.

1289
01:08:46.674 --> 01:08:47.985
You're not gonna like it.

1290
01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:49.159
What?

1291
01:08:49.194 --> 01:08:51.368
I found this swimming pool

1292
01:08:51.403 --> 01:08:53.543
-in Omaha.
-Yeah?

1293
01:08:53.577 --> 01:08:55.407
That's literally for swimming.

1294
01:08:55.441 --> 01:08:56.511
It's like one of those pools

1295
01:08:56.546 --> 01:08:59.100
that does this.

1296
01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:01.171
Like a splash pool.

1297
01:09:01.206 --> 01:09:03.242
But there might be a wave in it.

1298
01:09:03.277 --> 01:09:04.450
You've seen video of it or no?

1299
01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:06.590
Video is not looking good.

1300
01:09:06.625 --> 01:09:07.971
but. as far as
Nebraska's concerned.

1301
01:09:08.005 --> 01:09:09.110
it's our only shot. dude.

1302
01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:10.698
Because this is completely flat.

1303
01:09:18.050 --> 01:09:19.983
I try to hit a state every day.

1304
01:09:20.017 --> 01:09:23.089
I mean. I put 62.000 miles
on my van in less than a year.

1305
01:09:25.506 --> 01:09:26.955
We drive. like. eight hours.

1306
01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:27.887
surf.

1307
01:09:28.405 --> 01:09:29.337
edit.

1308
01:09:29.372 --> 01:09:30.718
go to sleep.

1309
01:09:30.752 --> 01:09:32.789
wake up. drive another
eight to ten hours.

1310
01:09:32.823 --> 01:09:35.171
Surf. edit. go to sleep.

1311
01:09:35.205 --> 01:09:37.173
It's just something that. like.

1312
01:09:37.207 --> 01:09:39.485
when I came up with surf
the 50 states. I was. like.

1313
01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:42.143
"Oh. this is gonna be super fun.

1314
01:09:42.178 --> 01:09:44.214
I can't believe no one's
ever done it before."

1315
01:09:44.249 --> 01:09:45.284
And there is a reason

1316
01:09:45.319 --> 01:09:46.665
that no one's ever
done it before.

1317
01:09:53.016 --> 01:09:55.743
This is actually
better than we thought
it was gonna be.

1318
01:09:56.537 --> 01:09:57.814
As of right now.

1319
01:09:57.848 --> 01:09:59.056
we're watching waves break.

1320
01:09:59.091 --> 01:10:01.127
but they're still just
lightning everywhere.

1321
01:10:01.162 --> 01:10:03.820
So. If I'm gonna
get a chance to surf.

1322
01:10:03.854 --> 01:10:05.546
the lightning is
gonna have to pass.

1323
01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:07.548
This is the kinda shit
I dreamed about. dude.

1324
01:10:07.582 --> 01:10:10.067
Surfing shit that no one
was ever gonna surf.

1325
01:10:10.102 --> 01:10:11.448
And then I would come do it.

1326
01:10:11.483 --> 01:10:13.105
And that's kind of
what the whole mission

1327
01:10:13.139 --> 01:10:15.038
was all about the whole time.

1328
01:10:15.072 --> 01:10:17.592
We're about to start
the surf culture in Nebraska.

1329
01:10:17.627 --> 01:10:19.145
This is built for swimming.

1330
01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:21.182
And after we do this.
this could become a thing.

1331
01:10:21.217 --> 01:10:23.357
Like. people might
want to surf after this.

1332
01:10:30.018 --> 01:10:32.435
I was in Florida.

1333
01:10:32.469 --> 01:10:35.196
And I was actually
surfing Typhoon Lagoon.

1334
01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:36.439
And I made a vlog.

1335
01:10:36.473 --> 01:10:38.268
And I was. like.
"Wow. my first wave pool.

1336
01:10:38.303 --> 01:10:39.856
"That was really fun.

1337
01:10:39.890 --> 01:10:41.271
"Wouldn't it be cool

1338
01:10:41.306 --> 01:10:43.377
if I went to Kelly Slater's
Surf Ranch?"

1339
01:10:43.411 --> 01:10:45.379
I know I said I wanted
to save the Kelly Slater

1340
01:10:45.413 --> 01:10:48.278
wave pool till after
I finished the 50 states.

1341
01:10:48.313 --> 01:10:51.281
But the energy just feels
so right. right now.

1342
01:10:51.316 --> 01:10:52.938
I think it's time.

1343
01:10:52.972 --> 01:10:54.491
"If you guys think
that would be cool.

1344
01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:57.874
"DM Kelly Slater.

1345
01:10:57.908 --> 01:10:59.669
and tell him that he should
invite me."

1346
01:10:59.703 --> 01:11:02.085
The next day. when my vlog
comes out

1347
01:11:02.119 --> 01:11:05.261
it just so happens to be
the last day of the season

1348
01:11:05.295 --> 01:11:06.607
for the Surf Ranch.

1349
01:11:06.641 --> 01:11:07.780
Kelly is there.

1350
01:11:07.815 --> 01:11:09.575
At the Surf Ranch. surfing.

1351
01:11:09.610 --> 01:11:11.957
Essentially. what happened was.

1352
01:11:11.991 --> 01:11:13.199
my vlog came out...

1353
01:11:13.234 --> 01:11:15.547
If you guys would please leave

1354
01:11:15.581 --> 01:11:19.620
Kelly Slater numerous comments
on his Instagram.

1355
01:11:19.654 --> 01:11:20.655
@kellyslater.

1356
01:11:20.690 --> 01:11:22.933
Please. go bombard this guy.

1357
01:11:22.968 --> 01:11:25.591
Tell him that he needs
to invite me to the wave pool.

1358
01:11:25.626 --> 01:11:28.353
I will be forever grateful.

1359
01:11:28.387 --> 01:11:30.009
And Kelly got
out of his session.

1360
01:11:30.044 --> 01:11:31.079
his surf session.

1361
01:11:31.114 --> 01:11:33.254
and he got to his phone.

1362
01:11:33.289 --> 01:11:36.015
and he had hundreds of DMs

1363
01:11:37.396 --> 01:11:38.639
from people

1364
01:11:38.673 --> 01:11:41.055
telling him to invite me
to the Surf Ranch.

1365
01:11:41.089 --> 01:11:43.471
He went on Facebook Live.

1366
01:11:43.506 --> 01:11:46.371
hundreds of thousands
of people watching.

1367
01:11:46.405 --> 01:11:47.993
and he was literally. like.

1368
01:11:48.027 --> 01:11:49.443
I'm gonna say this.

1369
01:11:49.477 --> 01:11:53.309
I got at least 50 messages today
to get Ben Gravy in here.

1370
01:11:53.343 --> 01:11:55.828
Ben Gravy. you will be
my first invite next year. okay?

1371
01:11:56.829 --> 01:11:58.106
Everybody tell him.

1372
01:11:58.141 --> 01:11:59.556
We were in the back
of the plane.

1373
01:11:59.591 --> 01:12:01.109
like. literally freaking out.

1374
01:12:01.144 --> 01:12:02.939
Everyone was. like.
looking at us.

1375
01:12:02.973 --> 01:12:04.975
But. dude. we did it.

1376
01:12:05.010 --> 01:12:06.011
You guys did it.

1377
01:12:06.045 --> 01:12:07.184
You guys did it.

1378
01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:09.601
Yay!

1379
01:12:09.635 --> 01:12:13.087
And he even said something like.
"I love that guy."

1380
01:12:13.121 --> 01:12:14.778
All those friends of Ben Gravy.

1381
01:12:14.813 --> 01:12:16.124
I got your messages today.

1382
01:12:16.159 --> 01:12:18.195
Tell Ben I'm going to get him
here next year

1383
01:12:18.230 --> 01:12:19.749
and we'll have some fun.

1384
01:12:19.783 --> 01:12:21.440
I love that guy's attitude.

1385
01:12:21.475 --> 01:12:23.822
And he goes
and surfs every wave.

1386
01:12:23.856 --> 01:12:25.444
Every novelty wave on Earth.

1387
01:12:25.479 --> 01:12:29.068
So. let's go make him
ride the best one.

1388
01:12:29.103 --> 01:12:31.243
First of all. I was
completely blown away.

1389
01:12:31.277 --> 01:12:32.658
I was honored.

1390
01:12:32.693 --> 01:12:35.385
I can't believe all those people
just went to bat for me.

1391
01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:38.215
Just through. like. the power
of the Nub Nation.

1392
01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:41.184
through just stoke.

1393
01:12:41.218 --> 01:12:43.635
pretty much just sent an average
guy to the Surf Ranch.

1394
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:45.878
Oh. my God!

1395
01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:47.639
How do you feel?

1396
01:12:47.673 --> 01:12:49.261
I'm tripping. dude.
I'm gonna throw up.

1397
01:12:50.711 --> 01:12:52.402
Oh. my God!

1398
01:12:52.437 --> 01:12:55.371
-Oh. my god.
-This is insane.

1399
01:12:55.405 --> 01:12:57.165
Oh. my god.

1400
01:12:57.200 --> 01:12:58.408
Are you kidding me?

1401
01:12:58.443 --> 01:12:59.375
Freaking out. dude.

1402
01:13:04.345 --> 01:13:05.760
This isn't real. is it?

1403
01:13:05.795 --> 01:13:07.521
-It's real.
-I'm gonna cry. dude.

1404
01:13:07.555 --> 01:13:11.456
And. for me. that was. like.
"What's the surf industry?"

1405
01:13:11.490 --> 01:13:13.043
Because Kelly Slater
just invited me

1406
01:13:13.078 --> 01:13:14.666
to his private wave pool.

1407
01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:16.219
You think I'm ready?

1408
01:13:16.253 --> 01:13:17.841
Well. I don't know.

1409
01:13:17.876 --> 01:13:20.844
Maybe we made you wait too long
and now you're gonna be nervous.

1410
01:13:20.879 --> 01:13:22.881
-I've been nervous.

1411
01:13:22.915 --> 01:13:26.678
It's hard to explain.
but it's. like.
that's the pinnacle.

1412
01:13:26.712 --> 01:13:29.232
He's the greatest surfer
of all time

1413
01:13:29.266 --> 01:13:30.509
and he was just claiming

1414
01:13:30.544 --> 01:13:32.097
that I should come
out there and surf with him.

1415
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:03.128
There was something
very empowering about it.

1416
01:14:03.162 --> 01:14:06.407
Like. we are changing surfing.

1417
01:14:06.442 --> 01:14:09.479
The fact that.
as a collective group.

1418
01:14:09.514 --> 01:14:12.275
there's so much power in just

1419
01:14:12.309 --> 01:14:14.795
people's opinions when
they band together

1420
01:14:14.829 --> 01:14:16.900
that they can actually
make things happen.

1421
01:14:16.935 --> 01:14:18.523
It's almost like a revolution.

1422
01:14:18.557 --> 01:14:20.559
Of course you want. like.

1423
01:14:20.594 --> 01:14:22.872
Surfer Magazine to be. like.
"Oh. the novelty guy.

1424
01:14:22.906 --> 01:14:24.632
"He's cool too."

1425
01:14:24.667 --> 01:14:27.428
Like. when I have
all these magazines
just pushing me away.

1426
01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:31.294
And then Kelly Slater
just goes. "Oh. yeah.
That dude's sick."

1427
01:14:31.328 --> 01:14:33.261
There's a level of. like.

1428
01:14:33.296 --> 01:14:35.988
"Wow. it doesn't matter
what anybody thinks"

1429
01:14:36.023 --> 01:14:38.439
because it comes back
to people.

1430
01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:40.372
Perception doesn't matter.

1431
01:14:40.406 --> 01:14:44.272
As long as you're living
your truth
and living your honest life.

1432
01:14:44.307 --> 01:14:46.620
and. like. just doing
what you wanna do.

1433
01:14:46.654 --> 01:14:49.588
who cares what
other people think?

1434
01:14:49.623 --> 01:14:51.763
I just want to say
thank you to everybody.

1435
01:14:51.797 --> 01:14:55.491
Uh. the universe is real
and positivity is real.

1436
01:14:55.525 --> 01:14:57.562
This is the main point
that I actually wanna make.

1437
01:14:57.596 --> 01:15:00.703
Three years ago.
I was 26 years old.

1438
01:15:01.497 --> 01:15:03.429
washed up. barely surfed.

1439
01:15:03.464 --> 01:15:04.672
blown out knee.

1440
01:15:04.707 --> 01:15:06.778
with a doctor telling me
I might never surf again.

1441
01:15:07.503 --> 01:15:08.642
I changed my life.

1442
01:15:08.676 --> 01:15:10.506
I changed my mindset.

1443
01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:12.853
And today I came
to the Kelly Slater wave pool

1444
01:15:12.887 --> 01:15:13.854
and I surfed.

1445
01:15:13.888 --> 01:15:15.787
Anything is possible.

1446
01:15:15.821 --> 01:15:17.374
If you chase your dreams.

1447
01:15:17.409 --> 01:15:19.894
if you put positivity
and goodness

1448
01:15:19.929 --> 01:15:21.240
out into the universe.

1449
01:15:21.275 --> 01:15:23.001
it will come back
to you. I promise.

1450
01:15:23.588 --> 01:15:25.003
I am living proof.

1451
01:15:25.037 --> 01:15:27.488
Thank you. Nub Nation
for the win.

1452
01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:29.525
I love you
and I'll see you tomorrow.

1453
01:15:29.559 --> 01:15:31.285
For the dream!

1454
01:15:31.319 --> 01:15:32.804
Because the dream
continues tomorrow.

1455
01:15:33.736 --> 01:15:34.564
Good night.

1456
01:15:40.605 --> 01:15:44.988
-Surfing Dude!
-Surfing Dude?

1457
01:15:45.023 --> 01:15:47.059
I'm gonna have to change
my Instagram handle. dude.

1458
01:15:47.094 --> 01:15:48.198
Surfing Dude!

1459
01:15:58.899 --> 01:16:00.901
This is truly what
it really is all about.

1460
01:16:02.627 --> 01:16:04.456
Surfing is one of those things

1461
01:16:04.490 --> 01:16:07.045
where you can pass it on

1462
01:16:07.079 --> 01:16:08.736
from generation to generation.

1463
01:16:08.771 --> 01:16:11.187
There is waves here in
Omaha. Nebraska.

1464
01:16:11.221 --> 01:16:12.602
and nobody surfs.

1465
01:16:12.637 --> 01:16:13.914
But now we got AJ.

1466
01:16:13.948 --> 01:16:15.916
our first surfer here
at the wave pool.

1467
01:16:15.950 --> 01:16:18.746
Guaranteed. in 20 years.
that guy has a crew.

1468
01:16:18.781 --> 01:16:20.783
and there's kid's
surfing here every day.

1469
01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:31.828
Ben's amazing. dude.

1470
01:16:31.863 --> 01:16:35.280
He inspired me to
live a dream. you know?

1471
01:16:35.314 --> 01:16:37.696
And that included my wife.
included moving.

1472
01:16:37.731 --> 01:16:39.111
and included doing
all the stuff

1473
01:16:39.146 --> 01:16:41.597
that I would have never done
without seeing Ben.

1474
01:16:41.631 --> 01:16:43.564
He not only affects

1475
01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:46.705
my life. but he affects
other people all the time.

1476
01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:48.465
Just his positive
mental attitude

1477
01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:51.848
and driving people
to conquer their dreams.

1478
01:16:51.883 --> 01:16:54.299
That's the tie
and why he's so successful.

1479
01:16:54.333 --> 01:16:56.646
I mean. it's a dream
just to be here.

1480
01:16:56.681 --> 01:17:01.133
watching him surf
this crappy wave pool.

1481
01:17:01.168 --> 01:17:03.653
All right. we came
to Nebraska today
not expecting much.

1482
01:17:03.688 --> 01:17:04.930
And with the weather.
I didn't even know

1483
01:17:04.965 --> 01:17:06.311
if I was actually
gonna get to surf.

1484
01:17:06.345 --> 01:17:08.278
But we showed up
at the Fun-Plex

1485
01:17:08.313 --> 01:17:10.453
and all the energy
was just so amazing.

1486
01:17:10.487 --> 01:17:12.213
And sometimes it's not
always about

1487
01:17:12.248 --> 01:17:13.663
the quality of the wave itself.

1488
01:17:13.698 --> 01:17:17.978
It's about the quality
of the energy. of the location.

1489
01:17:18.012 --> 01:17:21.637
So Nebraska well and truly
exceeded our expectations.

1490
01:17:22.361 --> 01:17:23.466
I'm honored to be here.

1491
01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:26.055
honored to check off
state number 49.

1492
01:17:26.089 --> 01:17:27.366
Moving on to the last state.

1493
01:17:41.657 --> 01:17:45.005
Ben's an anomaly
and they don't understand it.

1494
01:17:45.039 --> 01:17:48.974
Because a giant company
could put out a video.

1495
01:17:49.009 --> 01:17:51.321
and it's probably not gonna
get as many views

1496
01:17:51.356 --> 01:17:54.324
as one of Ben's videos.
who is just one person.

1497
01:17:54.359 --> 01:17:56.154
I mean. just because
you have a giant brand

1498
01:17:56.188 --> 01:17:57.811
with 500 employees.

1499
01:17:57.845 --> 01:17:59.778
it doesn't mean you put
any work on YouTube

1500
01:17:59.813 --> 01:18:01.849
to deserve more views.

1501
01:18:01.884 --> 01:18:04.818
I think it has a lot to do
with. like. charisma too.

1502
01:18:04.852 --> 01:18:07.717
You can buy a million views
or a million followers.

1503
01:18:07.752 --> 01:18:10.133
but is that real? No.

1504
01:18:10.168 --> 01:18:12.860
Is the influence Ben has
on some 8-year-old kid.

1505
01:18:12.895 --> 01:18:15.035
that he's never met.
in a different country. real?

1506
01:18:15.069 --> 01:18:17.002
Yeah. it is. That's the thing.

1507
01:18:35.296 --> 01:18:37.747
So while YouTube's
been around for a long time.

1508
01:18:37.782 --> 01:18:39.680
as far as the surf world
is concerned.

1509
01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:41.993
it's only really been
a big player the last

1510
01:18:42.027 --> 01:18:43.373
handful of years.

1511
01:18:43.408 --> 01:18:45.962
And. honestly. a lot changed
in the surf world

1512
01:18:45.997 --> 01:18:49.207
when Ben started
getting recognition.

1513
01:18:49.241 --> 01:18:51.450
and it's becoming this thing

1514
01:18:51.485 --> 01:18:53.659
where there's this
community of people

1515
01:18:53.694 --> 01:18:57.042
that wanna be able
to follow along with. like.
their favorite surfers.

1516
01:18:57.077 --> 01:19:01.219
And now YouTube
is a huge player
in surfing.

1517
01:19:01.253 --> 01:19:03.566
And companies
are realizing that

1518
01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:05.430
they can use the surfers

1519
01:19:05.464 --> 01:19:08.088
to directly relate
to the consumer.

1520
01:19:08.122 --> 01:19:09.192
And it's such a more

1521
01:19:09.227 --> 01:19:11.850
personal feel
than your advertising

1522
01:19:11.885 --> 01:19:14.784
that was in magazines.
or on TV. or whatever. prior.

1523
01:19:14.819 --> 01:19:18.581
And the game has
completely changed
in the last three years.

1524
01:19:18.615 --> 01:19:23.172
What we're doing as
a movement. creating content.
is the dream right now.

1525
01:19:23.206 --> 01:19:26.347
It's not about winning
contests because
it's all about having fun.

1526
01:19:26.382 --> 01:19:29.212
So by making these videos
on this rad platform.

1527
01:19:29.247 --> 01:19:31.076
and sharing everything
that we love to do.

1528
01:19:31.111 --> 01:19:34.010
and. you know. be that
person that could interact

1529
01:19:34.045 --> 01:19:35.563
like. "Oh. I can do the
same thing as Jamie.

1530
01:19:35.598 --> 01:19:37.048
"I could do the same
thing as Ben."

1531
01:19:37.082 --> 01:19:38.877
So. you know. it's like.
"Hey. get out there.

1532
01:19:38.912 --> 01:19:42.053
"Get out of your house
and film it.
Document your life."

1533
01:19:42.087 --> 01:19:43.640
Because. hey. we only live once.

1534
01:19:47.886 --> 01:19:51.441
I think Ben was nominated
for best vlog because

1535
01:19:51.476 --> 01:19:52.580
his dedication.

1536
01:19:52.615 --> 01:19:54.962
his hard work.
his everyday grind

1537
01:19:54.997 --> 01:19:56.826
to go surf no matter
where it was.

1538
01:19:56.861 --> 01:19:58.517
Whether it was in 50 states.

1539
01:19:58.552 --> 01:20:00.347
or whether it's in Puerto Rico.

1540
01:20:00.381 --> 01:20:02.798
he's out there making
the best of life.

1541
01:20:02.832 --> 01:20:04.351
And people really respect that.

1542
01:20:07.181 --> 01:20:09.321
It was a really cool moment
going to Surfer Poll. you know.

1543
01:20:09.356 --> 01:20:10.806
It's like
we're rolling in together.

1544
01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:13.429
Ben Gravy. Jamie O'Brien.
and our girls.

1545
01:20:13.463 --> 01:20:15.465
And it's just. like.
this happy feeling

1546
01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:16.950
and we're both just so psyched.

1547
01:20:16.984 --> 01:20:19.400
If you haven't checked out
Ben Gravy on Instagram...

1548
01:20:19.435 --> 01:20:21.678
Ladies and gentlemen.
the number one.

1549
01:20:21.713 --> 01:20:25.441
vloggiest vlog
in the whole vlogiverse.

1550
01:20:25.475 --> 01:20:27.650
the vlog the fans have chosen.

1551
01:20:29.894 --> 01:20:31.654
The J.O.B. Vlog

1552
01:20:31.688 --> 01:20:34.346
starring Jamie O'Brien!

1553
01:20:38.799 --> 01:20:42.527
We've been filming for years
and we never won an award.

1554
01:20:42.561 --> 01:20:44.701
Uh. I'm a speechless surfer.
Thank you...

1555
01:20:45.323 --> 01:20:46.462
for this award.

1556
01:20:46.496 --> 01:20:49.327
Um. best vlog.
Big shoutout to Ben Gravy.

1557
01:20:49.361 --> 01:20:52.709
He really drived me to. like.
see this thing in front of me.

1558
01:20:52.744 --> 01:20:54.608
And I'm. like. "I really
wanna do it!" You know?

1559
01:20:54.642 --> 01:20:57.404
And he didn't really care about
what people thought.

1560
01:20:57.438 --> 01:20:58.888
And I was. like.
I like this guy.

1561
01:20:58.923 --> 01:21:02.202
And. um. I went for it
because of you. Ben. Thank you.

1562
01:21:02.236 --> 01:21:03.410
You're the man.

1563
01:21:06.102 --> 01:21:08.449
It's honestly more
recognition in that

1564
01:21:08.484 --> 01:21:10.796
than there would be
from me winning.

1565
01:21:10.831 --> 01:21:13.144
Because. like. Jamie's the guy.

1566
01:21:13.178 --> 01:21:17.734
And he's up there
just being like.
"I'm here because of Ben."

1567
01:21:17.769 --> 01:21:20.910
And that was a moment
that I'll never forget.

1568
01:21:20.945 --> 01:21:23.671
A camera? Is this... Hello?

1569
01:21:23.706 --> 01:21:26.778
By winning that award
and giving my speech more so

1570
01:21:26.812 --> 01:21:29.643
as a thanks to Ben
was a huge honor for me.

1571
01:21:29.677 --> 01:21:31.645
And I felt like we both
walked away winning.

1572
01:21:32.784 --> 01:21:34.165
I mean. Ben's the madman.

1573
01:21:34.199 --> 01:21:35.891
He's the reason
why I'm vlogging.

1574
01:21:35.925 --> 01:21:38.894
And this is the reason
why we're all here right now.

1575
01:21:47.212 --> 01:21:50.215
I think the reason
that Ben's more successful.

1576
01:21:50.250 --> 01:21:52.148
and it's hard for a lot
of other people to do.

1577
01:21:52.183 --> 01:21:54.081
is because they don't
break down the wall

1578
01:21:54.116 --> 01:21:56.601
and they're afraid
of what other
people are gonna think.

1579
01:21:56.635 --> 01:22:01.778
And to get to a position
where you can change

1580
01:22:01.813 --> 01:22:04.850
outcomes. you have to
let people see you.

1581
01:22:04.885 --> 01:22:06.611
You know. either in all
your glory

1582
01:22:06.645 --> 01:22:08.716
or in all your failings.

1583
01:22:08.751 --> 01:22:11.098
And that's a really
unique gift.

1584
01:22:24.353 --> 01:22:26.700
Who would've thought
novelty waves would be

1585
01:22:26.734 --> 01:22:30.393
such a hit? But he wasn't
afraid to put it out there.

1586
01:22:30.428 --> 01:22:32.775
And now it's like.
"Love me or hate me.

1587
01:22:32.809 --> 01:22:34.397
"this is what I'm doing."

1588
01:22:36.089 --> 01:22:37.607
Here we are.
We're in Anchorage. Alaska.

1589
01:22:37.642 --> 01:22:40.265
We are on Highway 1.

1590
01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:43.027
This highway goes down
Turnagain Arm

1591
01:22:43.061 --> 01:22:44.994
where we're going to be
surfing the tidal bore.

1592
01:22:45.029 --> 01:22:47.341
We pretty much got
to the airport.

1593
01:22:47.376 --> 01:22:49.585
made sure the boards made it.
loaded up the truck

1594
01:22:49.619 --> 01:22:53.451
and we are on our way to surf
my 50th state.

1595
01:22:53.485 --> 01:22:58.249
I have been in contact with
the Turnagain Arm surf crew.

1596
01:22:58.283 --> 01:23:01.700
They seem really cool
and. hopefully.

1597
01:23:01.735 --> 01:23:03.599
we are gonna be able
to find a wave today.

1598
01:23:03.633 --> 01:23:06.740
and check off
the 50th and final state.

1599
01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:16.094
It's definitely
a difficult wave to understand.

1600
01:23:16.129 --> 01:23:18.372
It might seem
kind of basic. like.

1601
01:23:18.407 --> 01:23:20.167
"Oh. it's just this
whitewater push.

1602
01:23:20.202 --> 01:23:21.617
You just jump in. You got it."

1603
01:23:21.651 --> 01:23:24.861
But It's so surgy and turbulent
that it'll throw you

1604
01:23:24.896 --> 01:23:26.829
and it'll toss you around
pretty easily

1605
01:23:26.863 --> 01:23:28.279
if you don't know
what you're doing

1606
01:23:28.313 --> 01:23:31.109
and understand how to manage
the energy of it.

1607
01:23:31.144 --> 01:23:32.628
We have
40 feet difference

1608
01:23:32.662 --> 01:23:34.492
between high and low tide.

1609
01:23:34.526 --> 01:23:36.390
And at low tide.
it looks like a river.

1610
01:23:36.425 --> 01:23:39.600
And as the tide comes in.
it forms a wave.

1611
01:23:39.635 --> 01:23:41.947
and that wave pushes for miles.

1612
01:23:41.982 --> 01:23:45.468
As it fills in. it's like
your regular ocean wave.

1613
01:23:45.503 --> 01:23:49.162
If you have a super deep spot
that goes right up to mountains

1614
01:23:49.196 --> 01:23:50.508
and you have a swell.

1615
01:23:50.542 --> 01:23:52.130
doesn't really matter
how big the swell is.

1616
01:23:52.165 --> 01:23:53.787
if it's not the right
shape underneath.

1617
01:23:53.821 --> 01:23:55.478
it's not gonna make a wave.

1618
01:23:55.513 --> 01:23:59.034
So it's the shape
of the silt in the arm.

1619
01:23:59.068 --> 01:24:01.208
Yeah. there's totally
some incidents

1620
01:24:01.243 --> 01:24:03.107
and some horror
stories of people.

1621
01:24:03.141 --> 01:24:04.487
walking out of the mud

1622
01:24:04.522 --> 01:24:06.800
flats during low tide
and getting stuck.

1623
01:24:06.834 --> 01:24:08.767
and then the tide comes in
and they drowned.

1624
01:24:08.802 --> 01:24:10.390
There is definitely some
juju out there.

1625
01:24:10.424 --> 01:24:12.219
and a lot of people
have been raised

1626
01:24:12.254 --> 01:24:14.325
in this area to never
go out there.

1627
01:24:14.359 --> 01:24:16.913
And the dangers are real
every time we go out.

1628
01:24:16.948 --> 01:24:18.536
You know. Ben already
had it in his mind.

1629
01:24:18.570 --> 01:24:21.401
He surfed 49 states. And Alaska.

1630
01:24:21.435 --> 01:24:22.505
this is going to be awesome.

1631
01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:24.024
But the tidal bore was...

1632
01:24:24.783 --> 01:24:26.164
It was definitely a wave.

1633
01:24:26.199 --> 01:24:29.236
And we saw the internet.
and saw in all the great videos.

1634
01:24:29.271 --> 01:24:32.308
So we were. like. "Oh. Yeah.
This is game on. No worries."

1635
01:24:32.343 --> 01:24:35.932
But when you go from that
to actually being here
in Alaska

1636
01:24:35.967 --> 01:24:38.107
and putting your feet
in the water.

1637
01:24:38.142 --> 01:24:39.315
it's a whole different deal.

1638
01:24:47.806 --> 01:24:50.257
All right. here we are
at the Turnagain Arm

1639
01:24:50.292 --> 01:24:52.673
with the Turnagain Arm
surf crew.

1640
01:24:52.708 --> 01:24:56.194
These guys are the local
experts on the wave.

1641
01:24:56.229 --> 01:24:58.127
They're gonna help guide me
as to where the wave's

1642
01:24:58.162 --> 01:25:00.543
gonna be breaking.
and what board I need.

1643
01:25:00.578 --> 01:25:03.132
and everything that involves
the wave itself.

1644
01:25:03.167 --> 01:25:05.755
So. from my perspective
right now.

1645
01:25:05.790 --> 01:25:07.136
it's looking pretty flat.

1646
01:25:07.171 --> 01:25:09.897
But these guys are saying
there's a swell coming to.

1647
01:25:13.729 --> 01:25:15.248
Ben's. you know.
a perfectionist

1648
01:25:15.282 --> 01:25:17.146
when it comes to.
like. having fun

1649
01:25:17.181 --> 01:25:20.115
and really making
this wave be the one.

1650
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:22.565
So you kind of want all
your homework put together.

1651
01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:27.018
And then. when you go out
and get that one wave.
you don't miss it.

1652
01:25:27.052 --> 01:25:28.778
And you get it.
and you're in the right spot.

1653
01:25:28.813 --> 01:25:30.780
So there was
a lot of stuff that
we kind of had to learn

1654
01:25:30.815 --> 01:25:31.816
and figure out.

1655
01:25:40.997 --> 01:25:43.138
I. like. got off my board.
planted my feet

1656
01:25:43.172 --> 01:25:46.762
in the mud.
And the wave came. and
it was just pulling me back.

1657
01:25:46.796 --> 01:25:48.315
And. like. the the next thing
I knew. I was. like.

1658
01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:49.972
"Whoa. I'm in."

1659
01:25:50.006 --> 01:25:52.457
I'm in and I was just.
like. ripping.

1660
01:26:21.072 --> 01:26:24.351
The injury made him
take control of his life.

1661
01:26:24.386 --> 01:26:26.767
You know.
it was actually a good
thing that happened to him.

1662
01:26:26.802 --> 01:26:29.253
But. at the time.
it seemed like
it was horrible.

1663
01:26:29.287 --> 01:26:30.875
You know. you wouldn't
that on anyone.

1664
01:26:30.909 --> 01:26:35.017
But I think it changed
the whole
path then for Ben.

1665
01:26:35.051 --> 01:26:37.226
It woke him up.

1666
01:26:37.261 --> 01:26:39.849
It snapped something
in his brain. Like.

1667
01:26:39.884 --> 01:26:41.610
"I gotta take control
of my life.

1668
01:26:41.644 --> 01:26:44.060
"If I want my life to go
in this direction.

1669
01:26:44.095 --> 01:26:45.614
"I can make it happen.

1670
01:26:45.648 --> 01:26:47.995
"If I just do what
needs to be done."

1671
01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:50.135
I mean. 'cause
drinking is a cop
out for a lot of things.

1672
01:26:50.170 --> 01:26:51.792
and it makes life a lot
easier for people

1673
01:26:51.827 --> 01:26:53.173
because they just cop out

1674
01:26:53.208 --> 01:26:55.244
and they just stay
in that state.

1675
01:26:55.279 --> 01:26:57.833
He got out of it.
He just took it and said.

1676
01:26:57.867 --> 01:27:00.007
"I'm gonna change the world.

1677
01:27:00.042 --> 01:27:01.216
"I'm gonna make a difference."

1678
01:27:02.458 --> 01:27:05.703
And he is making
a huge difference.

1679
01:27:05.737 --> 01:27:07.222
A lot of avenues.

1680
01:27:07.256 --> 01:27:08.706
With the soft tops.
with the kids.

1681
01:27:09.741 --> 01:27:11.226
With surfing in every state.

1682
01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:13.883
Like. making it a universal
sport for the whole country.

1683
01:27:28.139 --> 01:27:29.623
We did it!

1684
01:27:37.769 --> 01:27:40.393
The wave chose
to pinch towards me

1685
01:27:40.427 --> 01:27:42.705
and give me the last bit
of the ride.

1686
01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:44.466
It was just so much emotion.

1687
01:27:45.812 --> 01:27:48.435
Out of body experiences
are hard to explain.

1688
01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:50.713
but it was so crazy
'cause I crawled up the rocks.

1689
01:27:50.748 --> 01:27:52.577
and a lot of it's hard
for me to remember.

1690
01:27:52.612 --> 01:27:54.338
But I ran up the rocks.

1691
01:27:54.372 --> 01:27:56.271
and I knew that Jordan
was up there.

1692
01:27:59.066 --> 01:28:01.828
So as soon as I saw Jordan.
I just broke down in tears.

1693
01:28:01.862 --> 01:28:04.727
Because it was like...

1694
01:28:05.797 --> 01:28:09.007
all that crazy shit.

1695
01:28:10.285 --> 01:28:11.182
I did it.

1696
01:28:14.841 --> 01:28:16.843
Jordan was a part
of this before

1697
01:28:18.051 --> 01:28:21.088
this was a job for me.

1698
01:28:21.123 --> 01:28:24.057
She was there when I was just
doing this because

1699
01:28:24.091 --> 01:28:25.990
I needed to do it.

1700
01:28:26.024 --> 01:28:28.441
It's like I've never
worked so hard

1701
01:28:28.475 --> 01:28:30.270
for something in my entire life.

1702
01:28:30.305 --> 01:28:32.617
I fucking did it!
Like. I really did it.

1703
01:28:33.963 --> 01:28:34.861
I did it.

1704
01:28:39.797 --> 01:28:42.489
Ben. in my mind.
doesn't have
to prove to anybody

1705
01:28:42.524 --> 01:28:45.665
that he can
rip like the top pro.

1706
01:28:45.699 --> 01:28:49.496
because he rips in his own way
and he's as good as anybody.

1707
01:28:49.531 --> 01:28:51.464
But I think. for him.
his important story

1708
01:28:51.498 --> 01:28:53.673
is to keep inspiring
those people

1709
01:28:53.707 --> 01:28:58.850
that don't rip to be themselves
and to go out no matter what.

1710
01:28:58.885 --> 01:28:59.851
and try it.

1711
01:28:59.886 --> 01:29:01.646
I think people recognize that

1712
01:29:01.681 --> 01:29:04.649
that Ben is being
completely himself.

1713
01:29:05.650 --> 01:29:07.031
He's being true.
He's being honest.

1714
01:29:07.065 --> 01:29:10.103
He's putting things
out there. as they happen.

1715
01:29:10.137 --> 01:29:13.106
It's almost. like.
kind of unfiltered. unedited.

1716
01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:14.797
He's being himself.

1717
01:29:14.832 --> 01:29:16.868
And I think that really
resonates with people.

1718
01:29:16.903 --> 01:29:19.733
He really. genuinely
is happy.

1719
01:29:19.768 --> 01:29:23.703
I think a lot of people
are missing
that in their lives.

1720
01:29:23.737 --> 01:29:25.152
And Ben brings that out.

1721
01:29:25.187 --> 01:29:26.809
People say all the time.
they comment.

1722
01:29:26.844 --> 01:29:29.433
and just say. like. "Thank you.
I needed that today

1723
01:29:29.467 --> 01:29:32.367
"because I was having
a horrible day and your vlog

1724
01:29:32.401 --> 01:29:33.954
changed my whole outlook."

1725
01:29:33.989 --> 01:29:35.991
You know. we're all human.
We all make mistakes.

1726
01:29:36.025 --> 01:29:39.028
And I think he started to see
when he was vlogging. that

1727
01:29:39.063 --> 01:29:41.341
there's a lot of people
out there who appreciate that

1728
01:29:41.376 --> 01:29:43.481
if you can put yourself
out there for who you are

1729
01:29:43.516 --> 01:29:46.864
and not worry that you
have a lot of problems

1730
01:29:46.898 --> 01:29:49.729
or things wrong with you.
it doesn't matter.

1731
01:29:49.763 --> 01:29:51.662
Other people do. too.

1732
01:29:51.696 --> 01:29:53.940
And there's a camaraderie
in that. and we can all

1733
01:29:53.974 --> 01:29:55.700
help each other.

1734
01:29:55.735 --> 01:29:58.185
Ben's change surfing
and the fact's that

1735
01:29:58.220 --> 01:30:00.049
every kid growing up

1736
01:30:00.084 --> 01:30:02.258
has only gotten to look
at the elite

1737
01:30:02.293 --> 01:30:04.019
as someone to look up to.

1738
01:30:04.053 --> 01:30:08.057
And Ben has shown everyone
that you don t have to be that.

1739
01:30:08.092 --> 01:30:09.576
You can be you.

1740
01:30:09.611 --> 01:30:14.063
however you are and whatever.
you know. gets you psyched.

1741
01:30:14.098 --> 01:30:17.653
You can be you and make
a career out of that.

1742
01:30:17.688 --> 01:30:21.933
What he's done with the vlog
and the surf world.

1743
01:30:21.968 --> 01:30:23.832
there's gonna be kids
growing up

1744
01:30:23.866 --> 01:30:27.318
who get to experience
a completely different lifestyle

1745
01:30:27.352 --> 01:30:30.908
of being a professional surfer
than anyone before us.

1746
01:30:30.942 --> 01:30:33.635
I'm living proof that anybody
can do anything.

1747
01:30:34.429 --> 01:30:37.535
Because I was that guy.

1748
01:30:37.570 --> 01:30:40.573
I lost. I literally lost.

1749
01:30:41.436 --> 01:30:44.922
And now. I'm here.

1750
01:30:44.956 --> 01:30:50.859
And whatever you want.
literally is possible.

1751
01:30:50.893 --> 01:30:54.794
Anything that you can imagine
is possible.

1752
01:30:54.828 --> 01:30:56.278
But you have to be willing
to work for it.

1753
01:30:59.488 --> 01:31:00.420
For the dream.

1754
01:31:11.535 --> 01:31:13.157
The journey
is now complete.

1755
01:31:13.191 --> 01:31:15.815
Ben Gravy has become
the first and only human

1756
01:31:15.849 --> 01:31:19.543
to surf in all 50
of these United States.

1757
01:31:19.577 --> 01:31:22.269
In doing so. he's managed
to touch the lives

1758
01:31:22.304 --> 01:31:23.754
of thousands of people.

1759
01:31:23.788 --> 01:31:26.308
Influencing and changing
people's perspectives

1760
01:31:26.342 --> 01:31:29.276
in the most honest
and heartfelt way.

1761
01:31:29.311 --> 01:31:31.589
Staring straight into
the camera. baring it all.

1762
01:31:31.624 --> 01:31:34.385
heart on his pineapple
T-shirt sleeve.

1763
01:31:35.455 --> 01:31:36.663
With the mission accomplished.

1764
01:31:36.698 --> 01:31:39.148
Ben's journey is now
a completed story

1765
01:31:39.183 --> 01:31:42.082
that forever exists to help
those in need.

1766
01:31:42.117 --> 01:31:44.809
Most. Ben Gravy
will forever be known

1767
01:31:44.844 --> 01:31:48.364
as the novelty wave king.
purveyor of stoke.

1768
01:31:48.399 --> 01:31:50.470
and catalyst for positivity.

1769
01:31:51.195 --> 01:31:52.921
No matter where you are.

1770
01:31:52.955 --> 01:31:54.785
no matter what
you are going through.

1771
01:31:54.819 --> 01:31:58.443
know that there is an entire
Nub Nation community out there

1772
01:31:58.478 --> 01:32:00.825
who is wishing
you the best in life

1773
01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:03.379
regardless of how
turbulent the waves.

1774
01:32:29.923 --> 01:32:31.994
Andy just bought a new hat.

1775
01:32:32.029 --> 01:32:34.031
Now he's psyching. bro.

1776
01:32:34.065 --> 01:32:34.997
Uh...

1777
01:32:35.584 --> 01:32:36.620
I don't know.

1778
01:32:36.654 --> 01:32:37.931
Dude!

1779
01:32:38.863 --> 01:32:41.210
Cool. dude.

1780
01:32:41.245 --> 01:32:42.280
Gnarly. Charlie.

1781
01:32:55.915 --> 01:32:57.226
Yeah. boys!

1782
01:33:03.716 --> 01:33:04.786
All right. ready?

1783
01:33:04.820 --> 01:33:05.994
Gnarly.

1784
01:33:06.028 --> 01:33:07.582
Can you
show your dimples?

1785
01:33:12.621 --> 01:33:14.036
They're not even psyched.

1786
01:33:22.631 --> 01:33:23.839
Big dog!

1787
01:33:23.874 --> 01:33:25.772
Dude. I love you.

1788
01:33:27.878 --> 01:33:29.569
He's not even stoked.

1789
01:33:29.604 --> 01:33:30.535
He's not stoked.

1790
01:33:32.296 --> 01:33:35.679
Just by watching Ben Gravy.
I've developed this attitude

1791
01:33:35.713 --> 01:33:37.888
where I'm gonna be stoked
no matter what.

1792
01:33:37.922 --> 01:33:39.406
Whether it be surfing.

1793
01:33:39.441 --> 01:33:41.754
skiing. skateboarding.

1794
01:33:41.788 --> 01:33:43.652
Um. he just inspired everything.

1795
01:33:43.687 --> 01:33:45.481
like my style and surfing
and skating.

1796
01:33:46.172 --> 01:33:47.518
Even art.

1797
01:33:47.552 --> 01:33:49.209
Beyond the scribbles.

1798
01:33:49.244 --> 01:33:51.418
