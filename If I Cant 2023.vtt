Life is funny. you know.

4
00:00:25.705 --> 00:00:26.717
One minute. you have

5
00:00:26.717 --> 00:00:28.719
everything you ever wanted to know.

6
00:00:30.656 --> 00:00:31.456
And the next.

00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:34.449
the next is all gone.

8
00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:38.996
Guess you got to count your blessings while you can.

9
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.194
Oh my God. baby.

10
00:01:16.841 --> 00:01:18.434
Your baby is so cute.

Thank you.

12
00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:20.688
How does it feel to be a new mom?

13
00:01:20.688 --> 00:01:24.963
Oh my God girl. weird. Okay?

14
00:01:24.963 --> 00:01:27.013
So weird.

15
00:01:27.013 --> 00:01:31.468
Hi baby.

16
00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:34.253
These still your favorite?

17
00:01:34.253 --> 00:01:36.173
Or you're gonna switch up on since you're baby mama now?

18
00:01:36.173 --> 00:01:38.534
Come on. now you know I would never switch up on you.

19
00:01:41.578 --> 00:01:44.591
See that's how we got that first one there.

20
00:01:44.711 --> 00:01:46.044
Now wait a minute. Momma. didn't you say you

21
00:01:46.044 --> 00:01:48.468
want a house full of grandchildren running around?

22
00:01:48.528 --> 00:01:50.083
Where would you get shit like that?

23
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.857
That skin to skin really do work.

24
00:02:07.452 --> 00:02:11.673
At least that works. I can't fit my jeans no more. Emory.

25
00:02:11.953 --> 00:02:14.704
I look terrible. - You look just fine to me.

26
00:02:14.704 --> 00:02:16.319
Oh. okay.

27
00:02:16.854 --> 00:02:18.831
You know. I'm just one cheeseburger away

28
00:02:18.831 --> 00:02:20.551
from being a fat bitch.

29
00:02:20.551 --> 00:02:21.595
I know that. you're lying.

30
00:02:21.595 --> 00:02:22.395
What?

31
00:02:22.395 --> 00:02:23.320
It's a good thing. you married somebody

32
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.870
who loves cheeseburgers

33
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.849
and will buy you all new clothes.

34
00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.184
You cannot afford to buy me new clothes.

35
00:02:30.184 --> 00:02:33.108
We can barely afford clothes for that baby.

36
00:02:33.223 --> 00:02:36.294
Well. your baby daddy got that promotion at work.

37
00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:39.017
Yep. you know what that means?

38
00:02:39.017 --> 00:02:39.842
What?

39
00:02:39.842 --> 00:02:41.037
More money.

40
00:02:41.977 --> 00:02:45.724
insurance. and more time to spend with y'all.

41
00:02:45.724 --> 00:02:48.394
Always say you think you will.

42
00:02:48.394 --> 00:02:51.378
That's why I'mma get you whatever you want

43
00:02:51.378 --> 00:02:52.707
because you believed in me.

44
00:02:53.787 --> 00:02:54.752
Just watch.

45
00:02:59.778 --> 00:03:01.036

00:03:01.036 --> 00:03:02.461
I love you too.

47
00:03:27.554 --> 00:03:29.942
I just put her down there.

48
00:03:29.942 --> 00:03:30.817
Oh. okay.

49
00:03:30.817 --> 00:03:32.442
How was work. papa?

50
00:03:32.442 --> 00:03:34.075
Work was work.

51
00:03:34.875 --> 00:03:36.804
How's the most beautiful girl in the world?

52
00:03:36.804 --> 00:03:40.104
I'm better now that my king is home.

53
00:03:40.104 --> 00:03:40.904
Come here.

54
00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:45.609
Oh baby.

55
00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.304
I should be the one doing this to you. Emory.

56
00:03:48.304 --> 00:03:50.335
You're the one that worked 10 hours today.

57
00:03:50.335 --> 00:03:51.135
Yeah but.

58
00:03:51.135 --> 00:03:52.375

66

Now did you find my blazer?

67
00:04:19.235 --> 00:04:21.718
No. ma. and I tore the house up looking for it.

68
00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:26.481
Well. I wanted to wear it to Bishop's dinner tonight.

69
00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:28.826
Emory. can you help her find it?

70

75
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.147
I mean. this look crazy.

76
00:04:43.947 --> 00:04:45.123
Oh mama. speaking to that.

77
00:04:45.123 --> 00:04:45.923
You think you can watch the baby

78
00:04:45.923 --> 00:04:48.239

79
00:04:50.221 --> 00:04:51.654

Touch that door. c'mon now.

Yeah. I figure we go to one on Whitworth. you know.

95
00:05:31.652 --> 00:05:33.427
That way we can drive past your dream house.

But you do realize it's Sunday. right?

97
00:05:41.597 --> 00:05:42.882

Baby. you do not understand. Ever since

105
00:06:22.855 --> 00:06:26.765
I was a little girl. I've always wanted to live in this house.

106
00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:31.269
You see my Pops? He would take us to all the bigshots

107
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.975
of Motown's houses. I'm talking Berry Gordy.

So. he's a bad motherfucker?

111
00:06:46.287 --> 00:06:48.097
Shit. I'm as cold as you.

112
00:06:49.489 --> 00:06:51.644
Y'know. I really don't feel alright going in here with this

00:06:51.692 --> 00:06:52.492

114
00:06:52.492 --> 00:06:54.792
Boy. you know we can't afford this damn house.

115
00:06:54.891 --> 00:06:55.691
Y'know. c'mon.

116
00:07:06.171 --> 00:07:07.416
What's so funny?

117
00:07:08.006 --> 00:07:08.806
Oh. nothing.

118
00:07:09.753 --> 00:07:11.347
Will you at least better act like you can afford

119
00:07:11.347 --> 00:07:12.247

00:10:51.506 --> 00:10:54.116
if we are not related

185
00:10:54.381 --> 00:10:55.853
Yes. we are.

186
00:10:55.853 --> 00:10:57.430
through marriage.

187
00:10:57.465 --> 00:11:00.255
Speaking of. where's my wife?

188
00:11:00.255 --> 00:11:01.630
She upstairs.

189
00:11:02.255 --> 00:11:04.860
The baby isn't feeling well still. so she asked me

190
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:08.065
to bring the thermometer and the breathing treatment.

191
00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:14.215
but she's trying to put him to sleep. So. maybe I can

192
00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:17.186
congratulate you on this beautiful house.

193
00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:22.312
I know you heard the streets on how fire my head game is.

194
00:11:22.507 --> 00:11:25.812
Look ain't shit up. Channa.

195
00:11:26.777 --> 00:11:28.066
You need to have some respect for my wife in her

196
00:11:28.066 --> 00:11:29.401
motherfucking house.

197
00:11:31.764 --> 00:11:33.889
Appreciate you bringing the machine and shit in here.

198
00:11:34.722 --> 00:11:35.802
This ain't enough.

199
00:11:36.692 --> 00:11:40.222
Especially. since I know your little secret.

200
00:11:41.839 --> 00:11:42.639
Biggie.

201
00:11:43.939 --> 00:11:45.759
What you're not gonna do is extort me.

202
00:11:46.883 --> 00:11:48.483
So look.

203
00:11:48.487 --> 00:11:50.712
I'll give you a extra 40 because we both know

204
00:11:50.712 --> 00:11:53.012
that's what your ass used to.

205
00:11:53.982 --> 00:11:56.812
You can get your snake ass to fuck up out my house.

206
00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:04.823
Damn.

207
00:12:10.403 --> 00:12:11.203
Shit.

208
00:12:35.009 --> 00:12:36.547
Oh. there she go.

209
00:12:36.547 --> 00:12:38.307
There she is.

210
00:12:39.238 --> 00:12:40.463
So I left the baby to sleep.

211
00:12:42.233 --> 00:12:43.338
And that Stephen is down.

212
00:12:44.757 --> 00:12:47.147
That means we got approximately 36 minutes.

213
00:12:47.218 --> 00:12:48.018
Oh?

214
00:12:48.096 --> 00:12:49.308
36 minutes.

215
00:12:50.158 --> 00:12:51.363
Instead of seconds.

216
00:12:51.363 --> 00:12:53.773
So christen this new house

217
00:12:54.753 --> 00:12:55.553
And celebrate

218
00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:59.635
6 weeks. postpartum. So take this off.

219
00:13:09.504 --> 00:13:10.304
Is that 6 weeks?

220
00:14:01.104 --> 00:14:02.194
Ah. shit.

221
00:14:02.522 --> 00:14:03.427
Mmh

222
00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:20.378
Give me a drink.

223
00:14:21.646 --> 00:14:22.446
Thank you.

224
00:14:26.948 --> 00:14:28.613

How about you say all that. what's the matter?

234
00:15:06.858 --> 00:15:08.213
Guess that's fair.

266
00:18:16.109 --> 00:18:18.839
Baby. I really think it's time that

267
00:18:18.855 --> 00:18:20.585
you open up these cards.

268
00:18:21.195 --> 00:18:24.420
You know. send these folks some thank you cards.

269
00:18:24.694 --> 00:18:26.814
It's the classy thing to do Har.

270
00:18:27.833 --> 00:18:30.053
And maybe you can wash your hair.

271
00:18:31.205 --> 00:18:33.405
You know. maybe your cousin can help you

272
00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:35.945
do your hair like she used to do when you guys were kids.

273
00:18:38.802 --> 00:18:39.602
Here.

274
00:18:40.803 --> 00:18:42.873
At least. think about it Har.

275
00:18:47.302 --> 00:18:48.987
Mama. can you take her?

276
00:18:51.047 --> 00:18:52.532

Look. it's gonna all make sense one day.

Until then. just slow down. baby mama.

280
00:19:39.961 --> 00:19:45.331
And enjoy the ride. Most of all...

281

282
00:19:49.108 --> 00:19:51.536
I need you to do me one more thing.

Oh. we should pray. Yes. let's pray.

Oh God. thank God yes. I didn't even have

00:22:59.186 --> 00:23:01.446
a prayer on deck. I mean. I don't even know how to pray.

339
00:23:01.446 --> 00:23:03.609
It's like. "hey God." and it's like. "dear God." it's like

340
00:23:03.609 --> 00:23:05.229
writing a letter. which is like.

341
00:23:05.229 --> 00:23:07.504

Wait.

Well. you are officially $400.000 richer.

345
00:23:23.129 --> 00:23:24.989
Emory would want you and your child to. you know.

346
00:23:24.989 --> 00:23:26.579
have a cushion to fall back on.

347
00:23:27.961 --> 00:23:28.951
What would he know?

348
00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:31.450
I'm all set.

349
00:23:31.608 --> 00:23:32.408
Yup. that's it.

350
00:23:34.146 --> 00:23:35.716
Guess I'm out.

351
00:23:36.395 --> 00:23:38.450
Hey. call me. We'll do brunch.

352
00:23:39.688 --> 00:23:40.488
Yeah. no.

353
00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:48.650
Can I see your ID?

354
00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:50.760
Sure.

355
00:23:56.781 --> 00:23:57.581
Here you go.

356
00:24:12.267 --> 00:24:13.067
Miss Giles?

357
00:24:13.975 --> 00:24:14.775
Mrs. Jiles.

358
00:24:16.762 --> 00:24:20.762
Mrs. Jiles. you currently don't have an account with us.

359
00:24:20.762 --> 00:24:21.757
No.

360
00:24:23.953 --> 00:24:27.173
In other words. it will take about 6 to 10 business days

361
00:24:27.173 --> 00:24:30.808
to clear for a deposit. Even if it's drawn

362
00:24:30.808 --> 00:24:32.738

So what do they call you Harlem?

611
00:41:18.078 --> 00:41:21.213
My daddy named me that. that's where he grew up.

612
00:41:21.548 --> 00:41:25.448
And when he with my mama. they took a trip there and that's

613
00:41:25.448 --> 00:41:27.078
where they fell in love.

614
00:41:27.102 --> 00:41:31.232
They called their old school summertime Harlem love.

615
00:41:31.514 --> 00:41:34.579
Well. shit it's summertime now.

616
00:41:37.132 --> 00:41:40.407
Listen to this old-school shit.

617
00:41:40.407 --> 00:41:42.292
Maybe we could have the same love they had too.

618
00:41:44.303 --> 00:41:45.103
Maybe.

619
00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:47.310
So what they call you? Rock?

620
00:41:49.006 --> 00:41:52.066
Scott to motherfucking Rock.

621
00:41:52.866 --> 00:41:54.131
First of all.

622
00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:56.495
it's cause a nigga had to hustle.

623
00:41:56.748 --> 00:41:58.253
A nigga used to sell rocks.

624
00:41:58.873 --> 00:42:00.548
That's all I have really knew.

625
00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:04.335
Secondly.

626
00:42:04.335 --> 00:42:06.905

632
00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:22.400

And now I'm Scott to motherfucking Rock.

636
00:42:30.202 --> 00:42:33.522

Yeah I would love to but I can't.

733
00:47:14.545 --> 00:47:16.120
You didn't drink shit.

734
00:47:16.494 --> 00:47:19.069
I didn't. I just never learned how to drive.

735
00:47:19.319 --> 00:47:22.084
My ex-husband would always chauffeur me around.

736
00:47:22.495 --> 00:47:25.115
It was like our thing like I was his rider. you know?

737
00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:29.165
That nigga really was lucky.

738
00:47:30.167 --> 00:47:32.427
No. we both was lucky.

739
00:47:33.995 --> 00:47:35.480
I mean. no shoot. Lucky.

740
00:47:36.883 --> 00:47:38.788
Why you stop riding for the nigga. huh?

741
00:47:38.788 --> 00:47:40.133
Yeah. I had no choice.

742
00:47:43.522 --> 00:47:45.777
Some thug blew his brains out right infront of me.

743
00:47:46.222 --> 00:47:47.657
Point blank.

744
00:47:50.063 --> 00:47:52.063
Baby. I'm sorry to hear that.

745
00:47:52.791 --> 00:47:53.736
Where was that at?

746
00:47:53.886 --> 00:47:55.336
Right in this hood.

747
00:47:55.336 --> 00:47:56.951
like 7 mile. in Livingway.

748
00:47:58.718 --> 00:48:00.238
Know what he looked like?

749
00:48:00.411 --> 00:48:02.511
What? I would never forget his face.

750
00:48:06.463 --> 00:48:09.113
You ain't gotta worry no more.

751
00:48:10.226 --> 00:48:12.141
You with me now. Okay?

752
00:48:14.152 --> 00:48:15.592
You staying with me tonight?

753
00:48:16.233 --> 00:48:17.583
That what you want?

754
00:48:20.794 --> 00:48:21.979
Yeah.

755
00:48:24.668 --> 00:48:25.483
Okay. then.

756
00:49:06.008 --> 00:49:07.398
You know you mine right?

757
00:49:07.638 --> 00:49:09.538
Is that right?

758
00:49:11.246 --> 00:49:13.221
First step is we gotta get you out your mama crib.

759
00:49:13.817 --> 00:49:15.662
Get you a spot by yourself.

760
00:49:16.797 --> 00:49:19.357
so we can be together whenever we wanna be.

761
00:49:20.415 --> 00:49:23.970
Yeah. no. The first step is me letting you know that I do have

762
00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:25.625
a child.

763
00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:27.895
he's about to be 3.

764
00:49:29.853 --> 00:49:31.313
That's him.

765
00:49:33.379 --> 00:49:37.569
Shit. that's beautiful baby. You got your little family. huh.

766
00:49:37.569 --> 00:49:39.044
Somethin' like that.

767
00:49:40.398 --> 00:49:48.938
Whatever you need. Whatever y'all need. I gotchu.

768
00:49:51.585 --> 00:49:53.965
But don't think one second though you ain't give me one lil'

769
00:49:53.965 --> 00:49:54.765
cute motherfucker.

770
00:49:57.422 --> 00:49:59.292
You ain't got no kids. Scott?

771
00:49:59.317 --> 00:50:03.947
No. But I'll put one in that tight wet motherfucker

772
00:50:04.922 --> 00:50:08.517
She'll make us a little girl you know?

773
00:50:09.507 --> 00:50:11.407
She'll have eyes like your mama.

774
00:50:12.429 --> 00:50:14.332
And hair like her daddy.

775
00:50:16.612 --> 00:50:19.442
I do not like this one bit.

776
00:50:20.882 --> 00:50:22.067
Why mama?

777
00:50:22.587 --> 00:50:24.667
Don't you think you're moving a little it too fast. Harlem?

778
00:50:25.422 --> 00:50:27.627
I mean how well do you even know this boy?

779
00:50:28.283 --> 00:50:30.193
I have been dating him for months actually.

780
00:50:30.979 --> 00:50:32.779
Okay. so have you met his family?

781
00:50:32.904 --> 00:50:34.404
And where did he live before this?

782
00:50:35.081 --> 00:50:35.926
Tell me that.

783
00:50:35.926 --> 00:50:38.476
Well. I did get to meet his mother. you would love her.

784
00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:42.700
And... mama. you gon' love him too. just trust me.

785
00:50:42.854 --> 00:50:45.849
I don't even know him. You don't find that strange about that?

786
00:50:46.544 --> 00:50:49.529
Mama. everything's gon' be alright I promise. Okay

787
00:50:49.703 --> 00:50:50.558
Just trust me.

788
00:50:51.448 --> 00:50:53.120

789
00:50:53.175 --> 00:50:55.620

790
00:51:24.312 --> 00:51:25.112

All this rushin' to move. all fast and swift.

797
00:51:41.182 --> 00:51:43.367
My Harlem's heart ain't built for another break.

00:51:43.814 --> 00:51:44.959
But mama...

799
00:51:45.112 --> 00:51:46.367

802
00:51:52.002 --> 00:51:56.102
Age? Kids? What do you do for a living Mr. James?

803
00:51:56.356 --> 00:51:59.179
I work at Chrysler.

804
00:51:59.179 --> 00:51:59.979
Chrysler.

805
00:51:59.979 --> 00:52:00.779
Yeah.

806
00:52:00.779 --> 00:52:01.594
Alright.

807
00:52:01.599 --> 00:52:02.414
Which plant?

808
00:52:02.414 --> 00:52:04.659
The one on Jefferson?

809
00:52:04.674 --> 00:52:06.042
Jefferson.

810
00:52:06.042 --> 00:52:06.842
shift?

811
00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:08.505
Midnights.

812
00:52:09.937 --> 00:52:11.187
How ironic.

813
00:52:11.344 --> 00:52:15.729
I work in manning the C shift and I been a team leader for the

814
00:52:15.729 --> 00:52:18.074
for the past eleven years and I ain't never seen you a day in

815
00:52:18.194 --> 00:52:19.169
my life.

816
00:52:20.861 --> 00:52:22.943
Oh that's probably because of...

817
00:52:22.943 --> 00:52:25.633
Nah. I don't know what else you lyin' about.

818
00:52:25.633 --> 00:52:28.153
but I for damn sure don't want my child a part of that shit.

819
00:52:28.589 --> 00:52:32.139
So the quicker that you can remove yourself from her life

820
00:52:32.196 --> 00:52:34.786
will be the motherfucking better.

821
00:52:34.831 --> 00:52:36.531
Just let her down easy.

822
00:52:37.176 --> 00:52:40.466
Cause my daughter can't lose another man she loves to the streets.

823
00:52:41.066 --> 00:52:45.461
And I for damn sure ain't about to lose my child. with your Chrysler.

824
00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:47.060
Bullshit.

825
00:52:49.246 --> 00:52:52.286
Is everything alright Mama?

826
00:52:52.286 --> 00:52:55.466
Oh yeah. baby! I'm just getting to meet my

827
00:52:55.466 --> 00:52:58.301

980

That's for me? Is it?

01:01:37.535 --> 01:01:41.285
The bigger the gifts. the harder the hits.

you see this shit?

1047
01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:46.215
Imagine if she coming in twice a week instead of one.

01:07:01.899 --> 01:07:02.699
While I drive?

1053
01:07:03.343 --> 01:07:04.588
I don't know about you.

1054
01:07:04.597 --> 01:07:05.397

1055
01:07:06.456 --> 01:07:07.996

I don't know if I could with these cramps.

1059
01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:16.185
I even sat down all these medicines you gave me.

1060
01:07:17.108 --> 01:07:17.908
How long you been on?

1061
01:07:18.728 --> 01:07:21.123

I should be out.

1063
01:07:22.657 --> 01:07:23.457

You're not getting back.

1066
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:28.610
You're gonna be my little girl.

1067
01:07:30.085 --> 01:07:31.280
Whatever you want. papa.

1068
01:07:32.777 --> 01:07:33.577
What time is it?

1069
01:07:34.475 --> 01:07:35.785

You at no right to invite Scott here like that. That was vile.

Okay.

And he said. he's changed.

1101
01:09:51.190 --> 01:09:51.990
He's changed?

1102
01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:53.990
And he's been miserable ever since you left him.

1103

I met his whole mama.

1116
01:10:19.592 --> 01:10:20.557

1121
01:10:27.513 --> 01:10:28.448

1253
01:17:40.205 --> 01:17:41.005
I know.

1254
01:17:43.429 --> 01:17:46.884
God ain't messing me up here so fast. I forgot my makeup bag.

1255
01:17:50.990 --> 01:17:52.920
Now talk to me. friend. What's going on?

1256

1257
01:18:03.405 --> 01:18:06.180
And the doctors-- I don't know.

1258
01:18:07.186 --> 01:18:09.446
really haven't more than a week to live.

1259
01:18:11.892 --> 01:18:15.607
I came in to that.

1260
01:18:18.112 --> 01:18:21.212
And pneumonia. yeah.

1261
01:18:22.149 --> 01:18:26.689
They told me my HIV turning to full-blown AIDS.

1262
01:18:31.186 --> 01:18:36.316
Do you need anything? Say anything I can help you buy or...

1263
01:18:36.316 --> 01:18:38.826
Girl. you still be on my death bed.

1264
01:18:38.830 --> 01:18:39.870
I'm serious.

1265
01:18:40.616 --> 01:18:43.411
I had to get everything right here.

1266
01:18:43.696 --> 01:18:46.161
You ain't telling me what I want right now.

1267
01:18:47.382 --> 01:18:52.402
A box to the arrangement

1268
01:18:52.415 --> 01:18:57.525
I got it. A pink outfit. Just the same color pink my mom wear.

1269
01:18:57.783 --> 01:18:59.898
And I'm gonna be right next to her.

1270
01:19:02.721 --> 01:19:04.541
I need one thing from you.

1271
01:19:05.378 --> 01:19:06.178
What's that?

1272
01:19:07.532 --> 01:19:09.462
Leave Scott's ass alone.

1273
01:19:11.221 --> 01:19:13.641
You know. he really changed though.

1274
01:19:13.665 --> 01:19:16.045
He's been a good dad and everything

1275
01:19:18.535 --> 01:19:21.095
Girl. you couldn't sell me on that nigga if he was on sale.

1276
01:19:28.087 --> 01:19:30.192
Hey. miss Taylor. How you feeling?

1277
01:19:32.082 --> 01:19:34.912
Hi doctor. feel good in the morning.

1278
01:19:36.427 --> 01:19:39.232
Well. I was unaware you had company. So. I'll come back.

1279
01:19:39.252 --> 01:19:40.052
Thank you.

1280
01:19:44.651 --> 01:19:47.951
That's your fucking problem. That's your problem right there.

1281
01:19:47.951 --> 01:19:49.796
No. that need to be your problem.

1282
01:19:50.449 --> 01:19:52.499
That's a type of man you need.

1283
01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:55.270
You know 9-5 men.

1284
01:19:55.985 --> 01:20:00.335
Get you a nice building staying at the house. Laying in bundles.

1285
01:20:00.867 --> 01:20:02.412
Raise your babies.

1286
01:20:04.483 --> 01:20:07.663
And leave Scott's ass in the past.

1287
01:20:10.633 --> 01:20:11.648
I hear you.

1288
01:20:11.923 --> 01:20:15.068
I'm just trying to process. All these is a lot.

1289
01:20:16.010 --> 01:20:18.865
Is this. this is just a shell?

1290
01:20:21.230 --> 01:20:23.465
And I am tired.

1291
01:20:25.997 --> 01:20:27.082
But you not.

1292
01:20:28.483 --> 01:20:31.758
So you keep living and don't you meet me at no crossroads.

1293
01:20:31.966 --> 01:20:33.366
No time soon.

1294
01:20:36.536 --> 01:20:39.216
Unless you bringing my makeup back.

1295
01:20:39.366 --> 01:20:42.061
Then put a little of...

1296
01:20:42.569 --> 01:20:44.159
I can't thank you.

1297
01:20:45.089 --> 01:20:46.819
I'm scared.

1298
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:49.970
I'm scared for you.

1299
01:20:52.411 --> 01:20:53.281
She isn't.

1300
01:20:54.409 --> 01:20:55.209
You...

1301
01:20:58.304 --> 01:21:00.359
I'm terrified.

1302
01:21:03.983 --> 01:21:04.783
Harlem...

1303
01:21:06.736 --> 01:21:08.171
Can you pray for me?

1304
01:21:09.176 --> 01:21:11.766
Cause I just don't think my lately.

1305
01:21:12.162 --> 01:21:12.962
Okay.

1306
01:21:21.374 --> 01:21:22.174
Hey. babe.

1307
01:21:23.879 --> 01:21:27.049
Yes. it was actually way worse than I heard her.

1308
01:21:28.085 --> 01:21:30.920
They say he not gonna make it. so they allowed me to stay.

1309
01:21:31.686 --> 01:21:34.851
Way past visiting hours. so I'm gonna stay as late as I can.

1310
01:21:36.750 --> 01:21:38.795
Okay.

1311
01:21:40.566 --> 01:21:43.096
So I'll see you after I grab the kids.

1312
01:21:45.224 --> 01:21:46.974
Alright. Love you.

1313
01:21:48.822 --> 01:21:49.622
Bye.

1314
01:21:58.154 --> 01:21:59.019
Hey. mama.

1315
01:22:00.518 --> 01:22:02.183
Mama. I want you to get the kids to.

1316
01:22:02.394 --> 01:22:03.304
You hungry?

1317
01:22:03.554 --> 01:22:05.024
Okay. baby. Okay.

1319
01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:10.895
Who is that mama? Whoever there?

1320

1323
01:22:16.131 --> 01:22:18.426
She came by. She went up to your room and grabbed

1324
01:22:18.449 --> 01:22:22.019
one of them fancy pair of shoes in your closet

1325
01:22:32.819 --> 01:22:33.619

But we can't fix this shit if you don't come home.

01:25:15.727 --> 01:25:17.912
Now we two grown ass motherfucking adults.

You left your kids. you left me. we miss you.

Ms. Charles.

1382
01:26:09.318 --> 01:26:12.203
This looks to be about the easiest deal we got done.

1383
01:26:12.639 --> 01:26:15.244
Oh. - Congratulations again on your new business.

1384
01:26:15.550 --> 01:26:17.405
I know your husband must be very proud.

1385
01:26:17.516 --> 01:26:18.316
No.

1386
01:26:18.726 --> 01:26:21.086
He probably smiling down on the days I'm right for

1387
01:26:21.096 --> 01:26:21.976
the first time.

1388
01:26:22.941 --> 01:26:24.486
Oh. my condolences.

1389
01:26:25.377 --> 01:26:26.552
Yeah. I should have asked.

1390
01:26:27.752 --> 01:26:29.167
Your husband was a lucky man.

1391
01:26:30.386 --> 01:26:32.301
You're a very beautiful woman. Ms. Charles.

1392
01:26:33.199 --> 01:26:35.089
No need to apologize. Mr. Bourne.

1393
01:26:35.329 --> 01:26:37.574
Please. Call me Bryan.

1394
01:26:38.692 --> 01:26:45.702
Well Bryan. I really appreciate that this is a big step

1395
01:26:45.715 --> 01:26:47.365
for my children and I.

1396
01:26:47.938 --> 01:26:48.848
Children.

1397
01:26:49.485 --> 01:26:51.800
Okay. I'm learning something new about you every second.

1398
01:26:52.815 --> 01:26:56.015
What? For real. if you ever need a trust set-up for your kids

1399
01:26:56.019 --> 01:26:58.904
or anything like that. I would love to help you keep your

1400
01:26:58.907 --> 01:27:00.147
husband's legacy alive.

1401
01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:04.064
I'm not sure if you're in a market for a bigger home

1402
01:27:04.699 --> 01:27:06.889
but. I do residential real estate as well.

1403
01:27:07.925 --> 01:27:11.565
You know what? I'm gonna have to take you up on that offer.

1404
01:27:11.576 --> 01:27:14.511
I actually buying this business was the first step. I didn't

1405
01:27:14.527 --> 01:27:16.482
even get us a place to stay in right now.

1406
01:27:16.652 --> 01:27:19.492
So maybe you can send me some properties you

1407
01:27:19.497 --> 01:27:20.852
have in a gated community.

1408
01:27:21.107 --> 01:27:23.412
And I can check them all on the flight back home to Detroit.

1409
01:27:23.908 --> 01:27:25.433
I am definitely get on that for you.

1410
01:27:27.029 --> 01:27:31.089
But again. congratulations Ms. Charles. I know you're gonna be

1411
01:27:31.094 --> 01:27:32.684

I just wanna say thank you for all you've done with me

1426
01:29:23.985 --> 01:29:24.785

01:29:25.128 --> 01:29:26.768
and helping me as much as you do.

1428
01:29:28.071 --> 01:29:32.391
And this is a small token of my appreciation.

1429
01:29:33.343 --> 01:29:34.883
Now. you know what I'm about to say.

1430
01:29:35.783 --> 01:29:38.858
Ain't no amount of money worth no piece of mine. Harlem.

1431
01:29:39.459 --> 01:29:43.629
That boy is crazy. He's been calling here 50 times a day.

1432
01:29:43.632 --> 01:29:45.842
I had to get rid of my house phone because of him.

1433
01:29:46.658 --> 01:29:49.583
You know. he's not stable. You need to call the police.

1434
01:29:50.108 --> 01:29:51.773
Hey. mama. I already did that.

1435
01:29:52.354 --> 01:29:53.709
And it not has helped.

1436
01:29:54.746 --> 01:29:57.296
I dunno who could thought a piece of paper can keep a crazy

1437
01:29:57.313 --> 01:29:58.198
person away.

1438
01:29:59.189 --> 01:30:04.054
And that's why. I gotta get me and mine out of here.

1439
01:30:07.612 --> 01:30:08.657

01:30:55.097 --> 01:30:55.962

And that bitch didn't even tell me.

1491

It's a dirty game. boy.

1492
01:32:50.134 --> 01:32:51.744
That money was sitting in a bank.

But the nigga wanted out.

01:33:25.272 --> 01:33:27.067
Thinking he was smarter than anybody else.

1503
01:33:28.814 --> 01:33:30.669
That's when he got his ass blown.

1504
01:33:57.171 --> 01:33:58.721

Your family? Nigga. I'll be ready to add a new edition.

01:35:06.442 --> 01:35:07.472

01:36:08.852 --> 01:36:10.267
Bitch. I'm trynna get my family back.

1536
01:36:10.281 --> 01:36:12.336
Don't nobody give a fuck about you or your pathetic

1537
01:36:12.358 --> 01:36:14.698
ass family. The only reason why I'm over here is because

1538
01:36:14.710 --> 01:36:16.165
I think something wrong with Shayna.

1539
01:36:16.355 --> 01:36:18.220
Now. we were supposed to go out two nights ago.

1540
01:36:18.541 --> 01:36:19.576
She didn't show up.

1541
01:36:19.975 --> 01:36:21.540
I went to her house to go check on her.

1542
01:36:21.691 --> 01:36:24.161
Saw the car. but when I went to go knock on the door nobody

1543
01:36:24.166 --> 01:36:25.081
came to the door.

1544
01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:28.440
Now. I'm over here to talk to Harlem because Harlem her family.

1545
01:36:28.449 --> 01:36:30.454
And she the only person who could do a wellness check.

1546
01:36:30.839 --> 01:36:31.639
Look.

1547
01:36:32.297 --> 01:36:33.802
Ain't nothing wrong with that bitch.

1548
01:36:34.298 --> 01:36:36.158
She probably out doin what hoes do.

1549
01:36:36.425 --> 01:36:39.375
But either way it go. Lolo. you gotta get the fuck on.

1550
01:36:39.758 --> 01:36:40.998
I'm about to get my family.

1551
01:36:42.056 --> 01:36:43.976
You really one nutty ass nigga.

1552
01:36:44.388 --> 01:36:46.153
When you gonna get it through your thick ass skull that she

1553
01:36:46.168 --> 01:36:47.028
don't want you?

1554
01:36:47.621 --> 01:36:50.886
Scott. niggas like you don't deserve good girls like Harlem.

1555
01:36:51.780 --> 01:36:53.145
The quicker you get that through your head.

1556
01:36:53.155 --> 01:36:54.310
the better off you gonna be.

1557
01:36:54.687 --> 01:36:56.097
Bitch. what the fuck you say to me?

1558
01:36:56.131 --> 01:36:56.931
Scott.

1559
01:36:58.011 --> 01:37:00.071
Now I know we all gonna act like we got some sense today.

1560
01:37:00.071 --> 01:37:00.881
right?

1561
01:37:02.612 --> 01:37:03.527
Yes.

1562
01:37:04.750 --> 01:37:06.650
I'm just here tryna get my family back. That's it.

1563
01:37:08.284 --> 01:37:09.659
Look at my little baby.

1564
01:37:10.171 --> 01:37:12.171
She then gone so big.

1565
01:37:12.171 --> 01:37:13.171
Yes. she sure has.

1566
01:37:13.171 --> 01:37:14.041
So can I wake her up?

1567
01:37:14.043 --> 01:37:15.108
Oh. no you shouldn't

1568
01:37:17.188 --> 01:37:18.073
Don't worry now.

1569
01:37:18.567 --> 01:37:19.367
You right.

1570
01:37:21.053 --> 01:37:23.458
Ms. Cheryl. I just came here to talk to you and Harlem.

1571
01:37:23.802 --> 01:37:25.802
I think something going on with Shayna. she gotta be in

1572
01:37:25.803 --> 01:37:27.933
trouble. because two days ago we were supposed to go

1573
01:37:27.934 --> 01:37:29.304
to a friend party like friends.

1574
01:37:30.503 --> 01:37:32.828
So you using those words real loosely.

1575
01:37:34.449 --> 01:37:37.134
And Shayna. she been up and running off since she was twelve

1576
01:37:37.147 --> 01:37:39.372
years old. My sister couldn't keep a leash on her. so I'm

1577
01:37:39.372 --> 01:37:40.912
pretty sure she gonna be just fine.

1578
01:37:41.793 --> 01:37:42.593
I guess.

1579
01:37:42.917 --> 01:37:44.117
Oh no. I'm sure.

1580
01:37:44.881 --> 01:37:46.741
Now Harlem's in the back with her guest.

1581
01:37:47.398 --> 01:37:49.733
You are more than welcome to say goodbye on your way out.

1582
01:37:57.954 --> 01:37:58.754
Hey.

1583
01:38:01.964 --> 01:38:04.199
Now. Scott. You know good and goddamn well you not about to

1584
01:38:04.205 --> 01:38:06.635
come up in my house with no gun on you.

1585
01:38:06.647 --> 01:38:08.002
after all of these threats.

1586
01:38:09.465 --> 01:38:10.690
I'm sorry. Ms. Cheryl.

1587
01:38:11.468 --> 01:38:13.473
I ain't even realized I had this bitch on me.

1588
01:38:13.843 --> 01:38:15.458
Know you can't be too safe.

1589
01:38:15.458 --> 01:38:17.353
Don't play with me. - You know where we at.

1590
01:38:19.496 --> 01:38:20.966
I'mma go lock it up in the wheel.

1591
01:38:29.989 --> 01:38:31.669
Let me see what is this.

1592
01:38:36.454 --> 01:38:37.599
So is this for me?

1593
01:38:37.991 --> 01:38:38.871
Nah.

1594
01:38:39.814 --> 01:38:41.504
This for Daddy's little baby.

1595

Come get your baby.

1598
01:38:56.305 --> 01:38:57.915
That's why I love you. Ms. Cheryl.
