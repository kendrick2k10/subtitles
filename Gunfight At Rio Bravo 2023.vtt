3
00:02:04.316 --> 00:02:05.283
Howdy. there.

4
00:02:06.952 --> 00:02:08.186
Good morning.

5
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.654
Hey. I wonder what
this alfalfa desperado's

6
00:02:10.688 --> 00:02:11.555
got in them boxes?

7
00:02:22.167 --> 00:02:23.834
- I'm not a farmer.
- My mistake.

8
00:02:25.237 --> 00:02:26.071
What are you then?

9
00:02:27.973 --> 00:02:29.007
I'm a businessman.

10
00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:36.580
Where are you from?

11
00:02:36.982 --> 00:02:38.582
I was born in Europe.

12
00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:40.318
So that's why
you talk like that.

13
00:02:45.357 --> 00:02:48.293
Hey. this stuff looks costly.

14
00:02:48.326 --> 00:02:49.727
Come over here and look at this.

15
00:02:50.362 --> 00:02:53.065
Don't open any
more boxes. please.

16
00:03:04.176 --> 00:03:05.010
Get down.

17
00:03:08.046 --> 00:03:09.247
now!

18
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:10.115
Now!

19
00:03:21.026 --> 00:03:22.094
If you haven't figured by now.

20
00:03:23.095 --> 00:03:26.031
we're gonna be taking
your wagon and your supplies.

21
00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:48.819
Your friend is bleeding.

22
00:03:48.853 --> 00:03:49.887
You should help him.

23
00:03:53.458 --> 00:03:54.792
Don't follow me.

24
00:08:52.357 --> 00:08:53.558
Good afternoon. sir.

25
00:08:53.591 --> 00:08:55.226
I don't mean to
intrude on your day.

26
00:08:57.395 --> 00:08:58.430
You're not.

27
00:08:59.597 --> 00:09:01.566
Would you be so kind to direct
us to the sheriff office?

28
00:09:06.104 --> 00:09:08.339
Tell you what. I'll take
you there myself. Marshal.

29
00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:10.975
That would be
greatly appreciated.

30
00:09:24.088 --> 00:09:25.290
You look very familiar.

31
00:09:27.325 --> 00:09:29.294
You sure? Not many look like me.

32
00:09:30.128 --> 00:09:31.196
That's true.

33
00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.165
Are you sure
we haven't met before?

34
00:09:35.733 --> 00:09:37.268
Don't think so. let's go.

35
00:09:46.744 --> 00:09:49.113
Now. here's where
I think we should expand first.

36
00:09:52.517 --> 00:09:53.585
Build right there.

37
00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:56.120
Huh?

38
00:09:57.422 --> 00:09:59.324
Maybe a new school. so we don't
have to keep using the church.

39
00:10:00.124 --> 00:10:02.193
We could do that.

40
00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:04.429
but there aren't that many
children in Blind Chapel yet.

41
00:10:04.462 --> 00:10:06.598
The church works
fine for their schooling.

42
00:10:06.631 --> 00:10:09.667
I think we should consider the
expense of expansion. Sheriff.

43
00:10:09.701 --> 00:10:11.636
That's why I'm
thinking about a sporting house.

44
00:10:11.669 --> 00:10:13.805
a nice sized one.
hire lots of girls.

45
00:10:13.838 --> 00:10:15.440
That way
we have a sporting house

46
00:10:15.473 --> 00:10:17.442
that gets real
big in the territory.

47
00:10:17.475 --> 00:10:19.310
draws a big crowd every night.

48
00:10:19.344 --> 00:10:20.612
Huh?

49
00:10:20.645 --> 00:10:22.380
A lot better money in that.

50
00:10:22.413 --> 00:10:25.116
The church-going folk
ain't gonna like that. Mayor.

51
00:10:25.149 --> 00:10:26.584
They will when
their wallets get fattened.

52
00:10:26.618 --> 00:10:28.386
Trust me. Sheriff.

53
00:10:33.391 --> 00:10:35.393
Ivan. what can I do for you?

54
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.262
This man needs to
speak to you. Sheriff.

55
00:10:38.162 --> 00:10:39.364
I'm Marshal Austin Carter.

56
00:10:39.397 --> 00:10:40.665
pleased to meet you. Sheriff.

57
00:10:41.165 --> 00:10:42.667
Sheriff Vernon Kelly.

58
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.169
This is Mayor Bowman.

59
00:10:46.371 --> 00:10:48.506
This is Deputy Walker.

60
00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.174
our prisoner. Ethan Crawley.

61
00:10:51.309 --> 00:10:53.344
We are escorting him
to the town of San Antonio

62
00:10:53.378 --> 00:10:55.079
to face trial for mass murder.

63
00:10:57.382 --> 00:10:58.716
I heard of him.

64
00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:00.485
I've heard of
Ethan Crawley. too.

65
00:11:00.685 --> 00:11:02.387
Why'd you bring this
fiend to our town. Marshal?

66
00:11:03.321 --> 00:11:04.722
To be honest with you.

67
00:11:04.756 --> 00:11:07.292
I've been riding for
quite a while. all night.

68
00:11:09.861 --> 00:11:11.496
The deputy and
I would like to get a meal

69
00:11:11.529 --> 00:11:12.664
and maybe
a couple hours of rest.

70
00:11:14.432 --> 00:11:15.833
Sheriff. if you don't mind.

71
00:11:15.867 --> 00:11:17.468
we'd like to keep our prisoner

72
00:11:17.502 --> 00:11:18.703
in your jail during that time.

73
00:11:19.437 --> 00:11:20.338
Not a chance.

74
00:11:21.439 --> 00:11:23.474
This man's a leader
of the Hellhound Gang.

75
00:11:23.508 --> 00:11:24.709
a bunch of cutthroats.

76
00:11:25.176 --> 00:11:27.779
They're monsters.
ghouls. even cannibals.

77
00:11:27.812 --> 00:11:29.847
They used to ride
with the Quantrill Raiders.

78
00:11:30.248 --> 00:11:31.716
killer of men.
women. and children.

79
00:11:31.749 --> 00:11:33.451
They used to
burn down entire towns.

80
00:11:33.484 --> 00:11:34.452
That's all we need to know.

81
00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:36.754
Now just a damn minute. Mayor.

82
00:11:38.222 --> 00:11:40.091
I'm not gonna be some
coffee boiler for a sheriff.

83
00:11:40.625 --> 00:11:42.894
The law gets
respect in this office.

84
00:11:42.928 --> 00:11:44.429
You can lock
your prisoner up here.

85
00:11:44.862 --> 00:11:46.598
Greatly appreciated. Sheriff.

86
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.568
Do you have any
idea what you just did?

87
00:11:51.736 --> 00:11:52.704
My job.

88
00:11:53.939 --> 00:11:55.373
Crawley ain't going nowhere.

89
00:11:55.406 --> 00:11:56.641
I'll keep a keen eye on him.

90
00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:59.644
You better pray
nothing bad happens.

91
00:12:00.244 --> 00:12:02.714
- Your job depends on it.
- Oh. yeah?

92
00:12:02.747 --> 00:12:04.449
Who you gonna
run against me. Mayor?

93
00:12:08.653 --> 00:12:10.555
Everybody listen up.

94
00:12:10.588 --> 00:12:13.691
No one breathes a word
of this to any of our citizens.

95
00:12:13.725 --> 00:12:14.726
Is that understood?

96
00:12:24.937 --> 00:12:26.471
You son of a Jezebel.

97
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:33.344
Thank you.

98
00:12:36.314 --> 00:12:38.483
We didn't mean
to get you in trouble. Sheriff.

99
00:12:38.516 --> 00:12:40.218
Don't worry about Mayor Bowman.

100
00:12:40.251 --> 00:12:43.254
I'm used to him pitching a fit.
he's always like this.

101
00:12:44.789 --> 00:12:46.658
Not always.
sometimes he's worse.

102
00:13:03.274 --> 00:13:04.475
Being that this town is

103
00:13:04.509 --> 00:13:06.444
so close to the Rio Bravo line.

104
00:13:06.477 --> 00:13:07.812
one might assume
it's got a border name.

105
00:13:09.881 --> 00:13:11.883
That's what I thought
when I first arrived here.

106
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:15.353
How to get to be
being called Blind Chapel?

107
00:13:15.386 --> 00:13:18.189
Hell. I ain't never
even heard of it.

108
00:13:18.924 --> 00:13:20.725
I've been told the town's
first preacher was snake bitten.

109
00:13:21.392 --> 00:13:22.226
and went blind.

110
00:13:23.028 --> 00:13:24.529
He died a few days later.

111
00:13:24.562 --> 00:13:26.464
The townfolk named
town Blind Chapel.

112
00:13:26.497 --> 00:13:27.865
in tribute to him.

113
00:13:28.633 --> 00:13:30.334
'bout the preacher?

114
00:13:30.969 --> 00:13:32.537
We have a new one now.

115
00:13:34.706 --> 00:13:35.840
What's troubling you. Marshal?

116
00:13:39.912 --> 00:13:42.513
Your mayor is
a little bit excited.

117
00:13:42.547 --> 00:13:43.748
Yeah. everything he said

118
00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:45.683
about Ethan Crawley
and his gang is true.

119
00:13:46.751 --> 00:13:48.519
They're the most vile
collection of miscreants

120
00:13:48.553 --> 00:13:49.721
one could imagine.

121
00:13:49.754 --> 00:13:51.556
And I can guarantee

122
00:13:51.589 --> 00:13:53.524
they're gonna want
their leader returned.

123
00:13:54.026 --> 00:13:56.561
As you could assume.
we're just a little distrustful

124
00:13:56.594 --> 00:13:58.329
of our environment at all times.

125
00:14:02.767 --> 00:14:05.770
You know a place
where we can dine and repose?

126
00:14:06.404 --> 00:14:10.341
Right there. the best biscuits
and gravy I've ever had.

127
00:14:10.374 --> 00:14:12.744
And the meal is free.
as long as you order a beer.

128
00:14:12.777 --> 00:14:14.612
Oh. I think we could do that.

129
00:14:16.781 --> 00:14:17.916
Will you join us. sir?

130
00:14:18.917 --> 00:14:20.451
As long as you call me Ivan.

131
00:14:21.452 --> 00:14:22.553
I can do that. Ivan.

132
00:14:27.558 --> 00:14:30.062
If this ain't the best biscuits
and gravy I've ever had.

133
00:14:30.095 --> 00:14:31.596
then I don't know what is.

134
00:14:31.629 --> 00:14:33.431
It might be kind
to your digestion

135
00:14:33.464 --> 00:14:34.532
if you ate a little bit slower.

136
00:14:36.367 --> 00:14:38.669
Aw. hell Marshal. I could eat
off the same plate as a rattler

137
00:14:38.703 --> 00:14:40.005
and my gut would be just fine.

138
00:14:40.738 --> 00:14:42.540
Where are you from. originally?

139
00:14:45.043 --> 00:14:45.877
La France.

140
00:14:51.649 --> 00:14:53.384
You seem to be an educated man.

141
00:14:54.619 --> 00:14:55.553
Where did you study. Ivan?

142
00:14:56.121 --> 00:14:56.955
Military academy.

143
00:14:58.623 --> 00:14:59.624
That's impressive.

144
00:15:00.825 --> 00:15:03.461
Myself. I was homeschooled
by my mother.

145
00:15:03.494 --> 00:15:07.665
and I can tell you she was
a stickler about education.

146
00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:09.600
What about your father?

147
00:15:10.969 --> 00:15:12.837
He was shot dead
by a drunken man.

148
00:15:13.939 --> 00:15:15.306
I was nine.

149
00:15:15.606 --> 00:15:17.042
I'm sorry to hear that.

150
00:15:17.075 --> 00:15:19.544
Thank you.
Tell you the truth.

151
00:15:20.045 --> 00:15:23.314
that's what gave me the
motivation to become a lawman.

152
00:15:27.085 --> 00:15:30.521
By the way. how did
you manage to catch Crawley?

153
00:15:30.555 --> 00:15:32.523
Well. mostly luck.

154
00:15:33.025 --> 00:15:35.127
I got tipped off by
a whorehouse boss

155
00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.696
that Crawley had the lustful
urge for one of his ladies.

156
00:15:39.597 --> 00:15:42.700
We went there and
recognized the two guys

157
00:15:42.733 --> 00:15:44.102
in front of his bedroom door.

158
00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:47.005
We sent both of
them in the boneyard.

159
00:15:47.039 --> 00:15:50.675
That we did. And we caught
Crawley naked in bed.

160
00:15:50.708 --> 00:15:52.577
and we placed him under arrest.

161
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:54.812
You should have seen
the old nanny he was with.

162
00:15:54.846 --> 00:15:56.747
She looked like
the hind end of a buzzard.

163
00:15:58.649 --> 00:15:59.483
She did.

164
00:16:01.419 --> 00:16:02.955
How is everything?

165
00:16:02.988 --> 00:16:05.623
Ma'am. if you fix
these biscuits and gravy.

166
00:16:05.656 --> 00:16:06.858
I'd like to ask you to marry me.

167
00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.795
Our cook is
actually an old. grouchy man.

168
00:16:11.896 --> 00:16:13.065
who drinks too much whiskey.

169
00:16:14.699 --> 00:16:16.667
And I'm sorry.
but he's already spoken for.

170
00:16:17.135 --> 00:16:18.669
Well.

171
00:16:20.872 --> 00:16:21.940
How is your day. Arlene?

172
00:16:23.041 --> 00:16:25.143
No complaints.
but I'd like to see you

173
00:16:25.177 --> 00:16:25.810
in here more often.

174
00:16:28.213 --> 00:16:29.747
Would you like anything else?

175
00:16:30.548 --> 00:16:31.984
I think we done. Thanks. Arlene.

176
00:16:38.856 --> 00:16:40.558
Have you seen Vernon today?

177
00:16:40.758 --> 00:16:42.593
I'm thinking about
bringing him some supper.

178
00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:44.896
I think you should
wait till little later. Jenny.

179
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:45.931
he's busy at the moment.

180
00:17:08.954 --> 00:17:10.454
What's going on. Sheriff?

181
00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:12.523
These men are Pinkerton agents.

182
00:17:13.058 --> 00:17:14.592
Hello. Marshal.

183
00:17:14.625 --> 00:17:16.727
We're here to escort
your prisoner. Ethan Crawley.

184
00:17:16.761 --> 00:17:18.130
the rest of the way to
the San Antonio prison.

185
00:17:21.699 --> 00:17:22.867
Do you mind if
I see your paperwork?

186
00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:23.734
Not at all.

187
00:17:24.903 --> 00:17:25.736
Here.

188
00:17:27.239 --> 00:17:28.606
Our orders.

189
00:17:40.818 --> 00:17:43.021
How did you know
Crawley was in Blind Chapel?

190
00:17:43.055 --> 00:17:44.889
Marshal here
telegraphed us from Grand Ridge

191
00:17:44.923 --> 00:17:46.757
and asked for our assistance.

192
00:17:46.791 --> 00:17:48.093
We figured
the Marshal and his deputies

193
00:17:48.126 --> 00:17:49.493
would be to your town by now.

194
00:17:50.062 --> 00:17:51.196
It is true.

195
00:17:51.762 --> 00:17:53.831
I telegraphed
a request for assistance

196
00:17:53.864 --> 00:17:55.633
from the Pinkerton Agency.

197
00:17:55.968 --> 00:17:58.036
But I thought that you would
meet us on the trail

198
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:59.837
before we reached
the town of Blind Chapel.

199
00:18:03.641 --> 00:18:04.809
Plans change.

200
00:18:15.988 --> 00:18:17.655
I'm not going to
release my prisoner

201
00:18:18.823 --> 00:18:20.524
until we reach
the town of San Antonio.

202
00:18:21.159 --> 00:18:23.095
No problem. we'll ride together.

203
00:18:34.739 --> 00:18:36.174
Help!

204
00:18:36.908 --> 00:18:37.943
I'll shoot her.

205
00:18:39.111 --> 00:18:41.279
I'm gonna shoot
this bitch. I swear.

206
00:19:04.302 --> 00:19:06.570
I told you Crawley's gang
was coming back. didn't I?

207
00:19:07.239 --> 00:19:09.607
This is just the beginning.
mark my words!

208
00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.742
They know he's here.
and they're coming back.

209
00:19:12.676 --> 00:19:13.711
This is your fault.

210
00:19:18.716 --> 00:19:19.717
Your mayor.

211
00:19:21.253 --> 00:19:22.586
he's a strange bird.

212
00:19:23.754 --> 00:19:25.823
but he's right about one thing.

213
00:19:25.856 --> 00:19:28.626
If my Hellhounds
return to free me.

214
00:19:29.194 --> 00:19:30.661
you are all
gonna be buzzard food.

215
00:19:31.196 --> 00:19:32.097
You shut your mouth.

216
00:19:36.068 --> 00:19:38.669
Vernon. shoot Crawley
if he tries anything. okay?

217
00:19:38.702 --> 00:19:40.005
I'll do exactly that. Ivan.

218
00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.396
Ivan. I heard shooting.
what happened?

219
00:20:04.429 --> 00:20:06.630
- We need Doc Adams.
- He left about a half hour ago

220
00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:08.233
to make some
house calls outside of town.

221
00:20:08.266 --> 00:20:09.201
Then you will help us. Nora.

222
00:20:15.773 --> 00:20:16.807
Put him here.

223
00:20:25.683 --> 00:20:26.684
You're hurt. too.

224
00:20:27.119 --> 00:20:29.087
- I'm fine.
- No. you're not.

225
00:20:29.121 --> 00:20:30.155
Sit down. Marshal.

226
00:20:36.962 --> 00:20:37.996
How is he?

227
00:20:40.432 --> 00:20:41.665
Nora?

228
00:20:42.067 --> 00:20:43.301
I can't help him.

229
00:20:43.335 --> 00:20:44.369
What do you mean?

230
00:20:45.303 --> 00:20:46.938
I'm no doctor
let alone a surgeon.

231
00:20:46.972 --> 00:20:49.107
but he--he's too far gone.

232
00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:53.311
There's nothing to be done?

233
00:20:53.345 --> 00:20:55.113
Is there any way
we can get him to the doctor?

234
00:20:55.813 --> 00:20:56.647
Would he make it?

235
00:21:11.729 --> 00:21:12.998
I'm so sorry.

236
00:21:30.881 --> 00:21:31.983
I'm sorry.

237
00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.888
Deputy Dennis Walker
was a good man.

238
00:21:41.059 --> 00:21:42.027
He was a loyal friend.

239
00:21:45.997 --> 00:21:46.998
and a great deputy.

240
00:21:49.434 --> 00:21:50.834
You'll be missed. my friend.

241
00:21:53.104 --> 00:21:55.173
Please. sit down. Marshal.

242
00:21:57.309 --> 00:21:58.143
Please.

243
00:22:14.025 --> 00:22:15.759
It looks like the bullet
just tore through the flesh

244
00:22:15.793 --> 00:22:18.463
and nothing more.
but you're bleeding badly.

245
00:22:18.496 --> 00:22:19.897
I need to close that wound.

246
00:22:32.177 --> 00:22:33.345
Here. drink this.

247
00:22:33.912 --> 00:22:35.180
It'll numb the pain.
Go on.

248
00:22:52.264 --> 00:22:53.565
How do you feel?

249
00:22:53.598 --> 00:22:54.466
It works pretty fast.

250
00:22:58.003 --> 00:22:58.637
Take hold of the Marshal.

251
00:22:59.404 --> 00:23:00.939
It's important he keeps still.

252
00:23:02.107 --> 00:23:03.141
Got it.

253
00:23:28.933 --> 00:23:30.568
Lookie here.

254
00:23:47.986 --> 00:23:49.120
Excuse me. Captain.

255
00:23:50.488 --> 00:23:53.124
The colonel is
still in Blind Chapel.

256
00:23:54.159 --> 00:23:55.460
What the hell happened?

257
00:23:55.493 --> 00:23:58.196
I was watching
from across the street.

258
00:23:58.229 --> 00:24:00.065
Everything seemed fine at first.

259
00:24:00.932 --> 00:24:03.468
Your two men had the Pinkerton
gear and the papers.

260
00:24:03.501 --> 00:24:06.638
and got inside the sheriff's
office. as you planned.

261
00:24:06.671 --> 00:24:08.940
There was also the Sheriff.

262
00:24:08.973 --> 00:24:12.510
a Marshal and
his deputy and. well...

263
00:24:14.112 --> 00:24:15.146
Well what. woman?

264
00:24:16.214 --> 00:24:20.352
Well. there was also
this big German. or Russian.

265
00:24:20.952 --> 00:24:23.321
biggest son of
a bitch I've ever seen.

266
00:24:24.222 --> 00:24:27.058
Then something occurred.
I could not see what.

267
00:24:27.092 --> 00:24:28.892
but your two men
draw down on them.

268
00:24:29.361 --> 00:24:31.529
Looked like Jackson was first.

269
00:24:31.563 --> 00:24:34.332
but this big German or
Russian went batshit crazy.

270
00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.335
Both your men are dead.

271
00:24:37.369 --> 00:24:39.270
I was lucky he did not see me.

272
00:24:39.304 --> 00:24:41.005
I might have been dead too.

273
00:24:41.039 --> 00:24:42.040
Son of a bitch.

274
00:24:48.079 --> 00:24:48.913
Thanks. Daniela.

275
00:24:51.249 --> 00:24:52.317
Tell the girls
down at the whorehouse

276
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:54.119
we'll be down to
see 'em real soon.

277
00:24:56.254 --> 00:24:57.389
Here's a little bonus for you.

278
00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:00.024
<i>Esta bien. gracias.</i>

279
00:25:01.993 --> 00:25:03.027
God damn it.

280
00:25:12.404 --> 00:25:14.139
Did you lie to me.
Pinkerton man?

281
00:25:18.042 --> 00:25:20.345
Did you lie to me about
who you was gonna meet?

282
00:25:22.247 --> 00:25:25.650
Now you said you was
gonna meet the Marshal.

283
00:25:27.585 --> 00:25:30.321
and deputy. and the sheriff.

284
00:25:31.156 --> 00:25:32.290
Is that right?

285
00:25:33.358 --> 00:25:36.294
So who's this big Russian
or German son of a bitch?

286
00:25:36.327 --> 00:25:37.328
I don't know.

287
00:25:37.362 --> 00:25:38.563
- No?
- No.

288
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:41.065
How about I cut
your goddamn pecker off?

289
00:25:41.099 --> 00:25:42.000
No!

290
00:25:42.434 --> 00:25:44.302
Please. I don't know anything.

291
00:25:44.335 --> 00:25:46.371
Please don't.
I swear I don't know anything.

292
00:25:47.772 --> 00:25:49.307
You don't know anything?

293
00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:51.443
You are no good to me at all.

294
00:25:58.683 --> 00:26:00.151
- Okay.
- Sir?

295
00:26:00.185 --> 00:26:01.019
Cut him loose.

296
00:26:17.101 --> 00:26:17.735
Get up.

297
00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:19.404
Get up!

298
00:26:23.441 --> 00:26:25.109
- Come on. boy.
- Give him a knife.

299
00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:26.544
Sir.

300
00:26:28.446 --> 00:26:30.281
Pick it up.
you yellow Yankee bastard.

301
00:26:31.483 --> 00:26:33.284
Pick it up or I'll kill you
where you stand.

302
00:27:28.106 --> 00:27:29.207
Back up. boys.

303
00:27:44.122 --> 00:27:45.223
Look at me.

304
00:28:10.448 --> 00:28:13.217
I must say. nurse Nora.
you do meticulous work.

305
00:28:13.251 --> 00:28:14.419
Thank you. Marshal.

306
00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.754
But I'm not really a nurse.

307
00:28:17.689 --> 00:28:19.824
I just have some
experience from the war.

308
00:28:19.857 --> 00:28:21.559
that and
watching the doctor at work.

309
00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:31.869
I never seen anyone being
so accurate with a handgun.

310
00:28:31.904 --> 00:28:33.438
I had some training. Marshal.

311
00:28:34.172 --> 00:28:35.173
Just some?

312
00:28:36.207 --> 00:28:37.442
- A lot.
- That's it.

313
00:28:38.543 --> 00:28:40.345
Now I remember.

314
00:28:40.378 --> 00:28:42.513
It was during the war
when we were introduced.

315
00:28:44.616 --> 00:28:47.652
Nora. may I present to you.

316
00:28:48.486 --> 00:28:53.191
Union Brigadier General.
John Basil Turchin.

317
00:28:53.224 --> 00:28:54.459
What's he talking about. Ivan?

318
00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.295
I'm talking about how no one

319
00:28:57.328 --> 00:28:59.797
can hold a candle
to this man in courage.

320
00:29:00.331 --> 00:29:01.799
He saved our hides twice

321
00:29:02.433 --> 00:29:05.169
from the Confederate
army in Chickamauga.

322
00:29:11.609 --> 00:29:13.811
Sergeant Austin Carter.
Third Division.

323
00:29:14.913 --> 00:29:17.682
It's an honor to
see you again. General.

324
00:29:21.586 --> 00:29:23.488
Is that all true. Ivan?

325
00:29:23.922 --> 00:29:25.523
It was war. Nora.

326
00:29:25.958 --> 00:29:27.926
- I had a job to do.
- You were a general?

327
00:29:29.694 --> 00:29:31.462
- Yes.
- How come you never

328
00:29:31.496 --> 00:29:32.864
told anyone in town about it?

329
00:29:33.598 --> 00:29:36.467
I was a soldier then.
The war is over.

330
00:29:36.501 --> 00:29:38.236
Yes. but a General?

331
00:29:38.269 --> 00:29:40.906
That's all anyone in Blind
Chapel needs to know. Nora.

332
00:29:58.023 --> 00:30:00.291
Samuel. where are you?

333
00:30:00.658 --> 00:30:01.793
I'm coming.

334
00:30:06.831 --> 00:30:08.266
What is it. Ivan?

335
00:30:08.666 --> 00:30:10.702
You got the bodies
from the shootout already.

336
00:30:10.735 --> 00:30:12.804
Yeah. some locals and I did.

337
00:30:12.837 --> 00:30:14.907
Why. what's wrong with that?

338
00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:16.674
Did you find any
personal belongings on them?

339
00:30:17.341 --> 00:30:18.710
No.

340
00:30:18.743 --> 00:30:19.711
You're sure about that?

341
00:30:23.881 --> 00:30:26.919
Sir. are you
accusing me of thievery?

342
00:30:27.418 --> 00:30:28.386
Do I have to. Samuel?

343
00:30:29.487 --> 00:30:31.957
Do you know how hard
it is to make money at this job?

344
00:30:33.025 --> 00:30:34.960
Hardly no one dies around here.

345
00:30:34.993 --> 00:30:36.561
Did you find anything or not?

346
00:30:37.295 --> 00:30:38.997
Nothing valuable.

347
00:30:40.431 --> 00:30:42.034
That's not what
I ask you. Samuel.

348
00:30:42.067 --> 00:30:44.435
I'll be cow kicked.

349
00:30:49.407 --> 00:30:50.241
Where is it?

350
00:30:57.348 --> 00:30:58.783
Here.

351
00:30:58.816 --> 00:31:01.352
Nothing more than that.
except a few gold teeth.

352
00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:03.788
You can keep the teeth. Samuel.

353
00:31:05.356 --> 00:31:06.724
Thank you.
that's so nice of you.

354
00:31:07.892 --> 00:31:09.894
Where are they?
Blasted teeth.

355
00:31:11.562 --> 00:31:12.597
Here. now. I--

356
00:31:13.464 --> 00:31:14.298
May I keep--

357
00:31:17.035 --> 00:31:17.869
Have a good day.

358
00:31:20.338 --> 00:31:21.539
Get that whiskey.

359
00:32:03.815 --> 00:32:05.616
I brought
you late breakfast. Vernon.

360
00:32:07.752 --> 00:32:08.954
Is this a bad time?

361
00:32:09.955 --> 00:32:11.622
No. it isn't.
this is fine. Jenny.

362
00:32:13.457 --> 00:32:14.325
It's your favorite.

363
00:32:15.393 --> 00:32:16.460
Sure is.

364
00:32:19.965 --> 00:32:21.899
How are things
over at the palace?

365
00:32:21.934 --> 00:32:24.635
The gunfire slowed
business down for a bit.

366
00:32:24.669 --> 00:32:26.370
but it's picked up since then.

367
00:32:26.404 --> 00:32:27.338
I'm glad to hear it.

368
00:32:28.606 --> 00:32:29.942
I know how hard you work.

369
00:32:29.975 --> 00:32:32.610
So do you. you're
the hardest working man I know.

370
00:32:37.849 --> 00:32:39.017
I can't wait to dig in.

371
00:32:43.487 --> 00:32:44.789
Mm. delicious.

372
00:32:45.023 --> 00:32:46.858
- Is it warm enough?
- It is.

373
00:32:48.826 --> 00:32:51.129
Well. well. well.
isn't that something?

374
00:32:53.831 --> 00:32:56.801
The sheriff and
the painted lady.

375
00:32:58.603 --> 00:32:59.637
fancy each other.

376
00:33:01.639 --> 00:33:03.008
You shut your damn mouth.

377
00:33:03.041 --> 00:33:04.943
She ain't no painted lady.

378
00:33:04.977 --> 00:33:06.677
Don't pay
attention to that pole cat.

379
00:33:07.045 --> 00:33:09.915
Did all that shooting
earlier interrupt your business.

380
00:33:10.215 --> 00:33:11.984
whatever shady
business that might have been?

381
00:33:14.119 --> 00:33:17.688
Anyway. that's nothing
compared to what's gonna happen.

382
00:33:19.157 --> 00:33:21.492
Just ask
your lovey man over there.

383
00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:24.795
You're all gonna be in
a peck of trouble. huh?

384
00:33:24.829 --> 00:33:25.998
What's he mean by that?

385
00:33:26.031 --> 00:33:28.866
What he means is
he's gonna get my boot

386
00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:32.004
up his maggot ass unless
he shuts his fucking mouth.

387
00:33:32.037 --> 00:33:32.870
Vernon!

388
00:33:34.106 --> 00:33:35.573
Sorry for my temper. Jenny.

389
00:33:35.606 --> 00:33:38.977
But that deuce can't
be believed for nothing.

390
00:33:39.011 --> 00:33:41.146
I know the type
of men like that.

391
00:33:41.179 --> 00:33:44.749
Speaking of men.
I heard of Vernon Kelly.

392
00:33:46.218 --> 00:33:48.086
but he was a hard case.

393
00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:52.057
He was mean enough to steal
a coin from a dead man's eye.

394
00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:54.859
And he was so quick
to pull his fucking iron.

395
00:33:56.929 --> 00:33:59.463
Jenny. and he had a Colt
just like your man over there.

396
00:34:00.265 --> 00:34:01.565
Have you ever heard of him?

397
00:34:02.134 --> 00:34:04.036
I have heard of
that Vernon Kelly.

398
00:34:04.069 --> 00:34:06.071
And I know for
a fact he changed his ways

399
00:34:06.104 --> 00:34:08.173
and became a good man.

400
00:34:08.206 --> 00:34:10.075
And now he's on
the right side of the law.

401
00:34:10.574 --> 00:34:11.575
Yeah.

402
00:34:12.576 --> 00:34:13.744
That's exactly what he's doing.

403
00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:20.919
You two ought
to charge for that show.

404
00:34:38.904 --> 00:34:40.471
What's the matter
with you people?

405
00:34:41.106 --> 00:34:42.975
You didn't hear
the gunfight earlier?

406
00:34:44.209 --> 00:34:46.144
You think everything
is right as rain now?

407
00:34:46.178 --> 00:34:49.147
Ethan Crawley
is sitting in our jail.

408
00:34:49.181 --> 00:34:51.582
and his notorious.
bloodthirsty Hellhound Gang

409
00:34:51.615 --> 00:34:53.584
are gonna come to
our town and free him.

410
00:34:53.986 --> 00:34:55.686
If you wanna stay
here and get slaughtered.

411
00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:58.957
that's fine with me.
but I recommend you leave town.

412
00:35:00.192 --> 00:35:01.994
you board up
your businesses and you hide.

413
00:35:07.631 --> 00:35:08.266
Now let's go!

414
00:35:24.182 --> 00:35:26.151
It all appears legitimate.

415
00:35:26.184 --> 00:35:27.718
Which means
Crawley's gang captured

416
00:35:27.752 --> 00:35:29.720
the Pinkerton agents
you were expecting.

417
00:35:29.754 --> 00:35:31.555
And they made them talk.

418
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:33.992
And that's how they deduced
we would be in Blind Chapel.

419
00:35:34.192 --> 00:35:35.726
- Yes.
- Perhaps I should

420
00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.195
take Crawley right now.

421
00:35:37.229 --> 00:35:39.031
and cut a path to San Antonio.

422
00:35:39.064 --> 00:35:40.865
You wouldn't make
it. they would get you.

423
00:35:42.367 --> 00:35:44.169
Does this town
have a telegraph office?

424
00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:46.604
It's presently not working.

425
00:35:51.143 --> 00:35:53.811
Would any of the town folks
be willing to assist us?

426
00:35:53.844 --> 00:35:54.879
I don't know.

427
00:35:56.348 --> 00:35:58.917
Nothing like this has
ever happened here before.

428
00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:03.255
What's that?

429
00:36:38.756 --> 00:36:39.590
Bless you.

430
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:47.099
Good to see you. Alice.
Take shelter. everyone.

431
00:36:48.233 --> 00:36:49.900
- What's going on. preacher?
- Haven't you heard?

432
00:36:49.935 --> 00:36:51.403
The Hellhound Gang.

433
00:36:51.436 --> 00:36:52.370
they're--they're coming
to free Ethan Crawley.

434
00:36:53.071 --> 00:36:54.239
Who told you that?

435
00:36:54.272 --> 00:36:56.241
Mayor Bowman told everyone.

436
00:36:56.274 --> 00:36:58.809
I don't know what else to do
but hide as many of my flock

437
00:36:58.843 --> 00:37:00.245
as I can inside the church.

438
00:37:00.278 --> 00:37:02.314
You're welcome to
join us if you'd like. Ivan.

439
00:37:02.847 --> 00:37:03.949
I can't.

440
00:37:20.932 --> 00:37:22.067
Doesn't look like

441
00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:22.867
we're gonna get much help.
Jenny.

442
00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:24.668
Well. they're all afraid.
Vernon.

443
00:37:42.087 --> 00:37:43.121
Men.

444
00:37:46.458 --> 00:37:48.792
they got our Colonel
down there in their jail.

445
00:37:51.062 --> 00:37:52.297
We gonna let
'em keep our Colonel?

446
00:37:52.796 --> 00:37:54.732
- No!
- Hell no. we ain't.

447
00:37:55.333 --> 00:37:57.335
We're gonna bring hell
down on them shit heels.

448
00:37:58.003 --> 00:38:00.238
I want you to ride in there
and shoot everything that moves.

449
00:38:00.272 --> 00:38:01.839
Yeah!

450
00:38:01.872 --> 00:38:03.175
After we thin out their numbers.

451
00:38:03.408 --> 00:38:05.676
we gonna march on
that jail and free our Colonel.

452
00:38:05.876 --> 00:38:07.312
Yeah!

453
00:38:10.282 --> 00:38:11.715
Mount up. Let's go.

454
00:38:27.898 --> 00:38:29.501
What are you all so glum about?

455
00:38:29.534 --> 00:38:31.970
Afraid my Hellhounds
gonna butcher everybody in town?

456
00:38:32.003 --> 00:38:33.138
Don't waste your breath.

457
00:38:33.171 --> 00:38:35.073
Says the blue-bellied General.

458
00:38:35.974 --> 00:38:37.375
Oh. that's right.

459
00:38:37.409 --> 00:38:39.077
I suddenly remember
where I know you from.

460
00:38:41.279 --> 00:38:44.049
You are that scoundrel General

461
00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:47.352
John Basil Turchin.

462
00:38:47.851 --> 00:38:50.188
Do I say it right? I don't want
to insult you. you know.

463
00:38:50.455 --> 00:38:54.059
General John here
led a pack of scorchers.

464
00:38:55.493 --> 00:38:57.128
He used to set towns on fire.

465
00:38:59.431 --> 00:39:03.034
Any of you ever
heard of the Rape of Athens?

466
00:39:04.135 --> 00:39:06.037
Did you tell 'em about
your court martialing yet?

467
00:39:06.404 --> 00:39:07.738
I was fighting a war.

468
00:39:10.442 --> 00:39:12.143
You rode with
Quantrill and his cowards

469
00:39:12.177 --> 00:39:13.211
who killed for pleasure.

470
00:39:14.212 --> 00:39:16.081
I remember the Lawrence Massacre

471
00:39:16.481 --> 00:39:18.250
committed by
Quantrill's Raiders.

472
00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:20.452
That was a disgusting act.

473
00:39:23.421 --> 00:39:24.788
You really think so. huh?

474
00:39:25.823 --> 00:39:26.925
Well. I kind of liked it.

475
00:39:36.968 --> 00:39:38.103
Not gonna use your rifle?

476
00:39:39.537 --> 00:39:41.805
I work better at
close range with these.

477
00:39:42.173 --> 00:39:45.343
I got something
here that works just fine.

478
00:39:46.945 --> 00:39:47.778
All yours.

479
00:39:50.515 --> 00:39:51.349
Well.

480
00:39:52.584 --> 00:39:54.119
wow.

481
00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.122
I can raise Cain with this.

482
00:39:58.923 --> 00:40:00.258
So how should we do this?

483
00:40:00.292 --> 00:40:02.327
Well. you are the general.

484
00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:03.194
What's your plan?

485
00:40:04.262 --> 00:40:06.264
Agreed. let's hear it. Ivan.

486
00:40:06.564 --> 00:40:07.798
Okay.

487
00:40:08.533 --> 00:40:10.402
You two stay here.

488
00:40:10.435 --> 00:40:12.437
Don't let him out of your sight.

489
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:14.572
And if the Hellhounds
get inside. just kill him.

490
00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:16.341
Will do.

491
00:40:17.008 --> 00:40:20.211
Girls. you should
get out of here.

492
00:40:20.245 --> 00:40:21.379
Stay with Nora.

493
00:40:21.413 --> 00:40:22.580
It's safe over there.

494
00:40:23.014 --> 00:40:24.115
I don't wanna leave you.

495
00:40:25.016 --> 00:40:27.152
You can't be here. Jenny.

496
00:40:27.185 --> 00:40:30.522
Please. do what Ivan says.

497
00:40:30.555 --> 00:40:33.425
Ladies. just go to
the doctor's office. please.

498
00:40:34.326 --> 00:40:35.527
Come on. Jenny.

499
00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:36.594
Let's go.

500
00:40:43.635 --> 00:40:45.303
It's loaded.

501
00:40:45.337 --> 00:40:48.473
Wait. you don't
want any firearms?

502
00:40:49.307 --> 00:40:50.975
No. I have my own.

503
00:41:00.452 --> 00:41:01.286
A word?

504
00:41:06.624 --> 00:41:10.328
Listen. I don't give a pig's
ass what happened in the war.

505
00:41:11.496 --> 00:41:13.098
But I've seen you in action.

506
00:41:13.598 --> 00:41:14.933
You know what you're doing.

507
00:41:15.533 --> 00:41:17.502
But just between you and me.

508
00:41:17.535 --> 00:41:19.637
I get the feeling we got
our hair in the butter bad

509
00:41:19.671 --> 00:41:20.871
with these Hellhounds.

510
00:41:21.539 --> 00:41:22.374
Probably.

511
00:41:24.509 --> 00:41:26.244
You ever been up
against these kinda odds?

512
00:41:26.978 --> 00:41:27.579
Many times.

513
00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:29.647
What did you do?

514
00:41:31.683 --> 00:41:33.051
If you want to beat the enemy.

515
00:41:34.452 --> 00:41:35.320
you have to do
everything better.

516
00:41:36.554 --> 00:41:38.656
If they're strong.
you have to be stronger.

517
00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:41.926
If they fight hard.
you have to fight even harder.

518
00:41:42.627 --> 00:41:43.561
What if they're monsters?

519
00:41:46.598 --> 00:41:49.334
Anyone can be
a monster. you'd be surprised.

520
00:41:49.367 --> 00:41:50.435
No. I wouldn't.

521
00:41:51.102 --> 00:41:52.637
I used to be one a while back.

522
00:41:54.406 --> 00:41:56.374
I reckon today
I'll have to be one again.

523
00:41:57.342 --> 00:42:00.044
No. you have to be the Sheriff.

524
00:42:00.078 --> 00:42:01.546
That's who you are.

525
00:42:01.579 --> 00:42:03.314
Keep your town safe.

526
00:42:03.348 --> 00:42:04.916
Keep your prisoner behind bars.

527
00:42:06.384 --> 00:42:07.419
That's your duty.

528
00:42:08.286 --> 00:42:10.188
Even if it means being ruthless.

529
00:42:10.488 --> 00:42:12.524
Well. in that case. why don't
I just go back in there

530
00:42:12.557 --> 00:42:14.392
and cut down
Crawley where he stands?

531
00:42:15.693 --> 00:42:17.328
I thought about
doing the same thing.

532
00:42:18.029 --> 00:42:19.264
Well. why in the hell don't you?

533
00:42:19.764 --> 00:42:21.533
Two reasons.

534
00:42:21.566 --> 00:42:24.702
First. it won't stop
the Hellhounds from coming here.

535
00:42:26.104 --> 00:42:30.375
And second. most importantly.
Crawley deserves to be hanged.

536
00:42:33.278 --> 00:42:35.413
It'd sure be nice
seeing him swinging

537
00:42:35.447 --> 00:42:36.981
from the end of a rope.

538
00:42:37.549 --> 00:42:39.017
It sure will. Sheriff.

539
00:44:05.303 --> 00:44:07.171
When did you get all this?

540
00:44:07.205 --> 00:44:09.107
Over the years.
You know how to shoot?

541
00:44:09.874 --> 00:44:12.677
Ever since I was young.
my parents made sure of it.

542
00:44:14.379 --> 00:44:16.114
How about you. Arlene?

543
00:44:18.716 --> 00:44:21.819
Aim. and pull the trigger?

544
00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:24.155
Right.

545
00:44:24.188 --> 00:44:25.456
but it needs to be loaded first.

546
00:44:26.724 --> 00:44:28.560
Here. I'll show
you how. it's easy.

547
00:44:28.593 --> 00:44:29.627
Jenny?

548
00:44:30.628 --> 00:44:32.430
I've fired a gun before.
Vernon showed me how.

549
00:44:32.797 --> 00:44:33.631
Good.

550
00:44:34.899 --> 00:44:35.733
Ivan?

551
00:44:58.289 --> 00:45:00.124
Why didn't you ever
say anything about the war?

552
00:45:00.926 --> 00:45:04.562
I told you Nora.
it's nobody's business.

553
00:45:06.864 --> 00:45:07.765
What are you hiding?

554
00:45:08.934 --> 00:45:09.767
Nothing.

555
00:45:10.768 --> 00:45:12.136
You're not a good liar.

556
00:45:14.639 --> 00:45:15.673
I'm not lying to you.

557
00:45:18.743 --> 00:45:21.446
Then tell me what
happened in the war.

558
00:45:23.548 --> 00:45:24.882
Why?

559
00:45:24.917 --> 00:45:27.518
Because
you need to tell someone.

560
00:45:29.287 --> 00:45:30.588
It's eating you alive.

561
00:45:33.891 --> 00:45:37.161
Did you ever hear
about the Rape of Athens?

562
00:45:37.762 --> 00:45:39.330
I heard some things about it.

563
00:45:41.466 --> 00:45:43.434
My regiment took
control of Athens. Alabama.

564
00:45:46.537 --> 00:45:49.240
But to be honest with you.
the only thing I was doing.

565
00:45:50.408 --> 00:45:54.445
I was watching my brave men
get picked off one by one.

566
00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:56.581
not just by Confederates.

567
00:45:58.917 --> 00:46:00.451
but by the town folks as well.

568
00:46:02.453 --> 00:46:04.255
That must have been awful.

569
00:46:05.456 --> 00:46:06.290
It was a nightmare.

570
00:46:07.659 --> 00:46:08.726
and I couldn't
stop it from happening.

571
00:46:09.494 --> 00:46:10.628
What'd you do?

572
00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:12.664
I lost my temper.

573
00:46:15.366 --> 00:46:17.936
One day I said to my troops
that I'm going to close my eyes.

574
00:46:19.771 --> 00:46:21.539
Won't see nothing for two hours.

575
00:46:24.442 --> 00:46:27.845
So I left the city and
they ransacked all of Athens.

576
00:46:30.381 --> 00:46:33.251
A lot of
that happened in the war.

577
00:46:33.284 --> 00:46:37.321
But I was a Colonel in
charge of all 19th Regiment.

578
00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:41.526
Some military square heads.
they didn't like what I did.

579
00:46:42.995 --> 00:46:44.662
So I was court martialed. Nora.

580
00:46:47.465 --> 00:46:48.666
And I said to the court.

581
00:46:49.767 --> 00:46:53.738
that you cannot fight
slavers with soft gloves.

582
00:46:57.675 --> 00:47:01.279
It turned out President Lincoln
heard about me and my trial.

583
00:47:01.546 --> 00:47:05.383
So he reinstated me and promoted
me to Brigadier General.

584
00:47:07.318 --> 00:47:07.953
Well.

585
00:47:08.886 --> 00:47:09.687
then that's that.

586
00:47:10.588 --> 00:47:11.522
You were in the right.

587
00:47:13.691 --> 00:47:14.759
Some people don't think so.

588
00:47:15.593 --> 00:47:16.627
What do they know?

589
00:47:19.597 --> 00:47:20.832
I can't say I disagree.

590
00:47:22.834 --> 00:47:23.668
But it was war.

591
00:47:24.769 --> 00:47:25.603
It was war.

592
00:47:26.871 --> 00:47:28.539
That's what I keep
telling myself. Nora.

593
00:47:28.573 --> 00:47:29.807
But it's the truth.

594
00:47:31.342 --> 00:47:33.711
You were just
trying to protect your men

595
00:47:33.745 --> 00:47:35.346
during a time of madness.

596
00:47:35.379 --> 00:47:37.381
Just like you're
trying to protect all of us now

597
00:47:37.415 --> 00:47:38.249
from Crawley's gang.

598
00:47:39.417 --> 00:47:40.451
I'm not so sure. Nora.

599
00:47:44.689 --> 00:47:45.590
Guess what?

600
00:47:46.858 --> 00:47:47.859
I am.

601
00:47:56.768 --> 00:47:59.303
No matter what
happens outside. stay hidden.

602
00:47:59.771 --> 00:48:01.272
Don't let
Crawley's gang find you.

603
00:48:02.774 --> 00:48:03.608
What if they do?

604
00:48:05.409 --> 00:48:06.544
Just make sure they don't.

605
00:48:07.445 --> 00:48:10.916
Are you saying we might
have to use these on ourselves?

606
00:48:10.949 --> 00:48:14.019
No. use it on anyone
who comes through this door.

607
00:48:17.055 --> 00:48:17.889
Ivan?

608
00:48:19.757 --> 00:48:20.591
Come back alive.

609
00:48:48.386 --> 00:48:49.353
You know what I'm thinking?

610
00:48:53.058 --> 00:48:55.961
There's gonna be one hard
killing time coming up soon.

611
00:48:55.994 --> 00:48:58.763
Yes. and it's highly unlikely
you will see the end of it.

612
00:48:59.497 --> 00:49:02.134
Unless of course.
we all survive.

613
00:49:02.167 --> 00:49:03.401
In that case.

614
00:49:04.535 --> 00:49:06.637
we will escort you to
the town of San Antonio to hang.

615
00:49:10.408 --> 00:49:12.710
Those are some future
plans you got there. Crawley.

616
00:49:46.577 --> 00:49:49.814
So. you think
you're ready for us. do you?

617
00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:14.099
Jenny. you take the window.

618
00:51:14.632 --> 00:51:15.666
Go.

619
00:52:32.743 --> 00:52:34.946
No!

620
00:52:56.901 --> 00:52:58.836
Lookie here.

621
00:52:58.869 --> 00:53:01.106
You think you're the first
man to ever point a gun at me?

622
00:54:32.830 --> 00:54:34.032
You go over there.

623
00:54:34.065 --> 00:54:35.100
You go up the stairs.

624
00:55:33.791 --> 00:55:35.961
Stay here.
I'm gonna check on the door.

625
00:55:55.547 --> 00:55:56.780
Jenny.

626
00:56:07.292 --> 00:56:09.561
Son of a bitch.
I can't stand this.

627
00:56:09.594 --> 00:56:11.029
Watch Crawley.

628
00:56:15.333 --> 00:56:16.234
Good luck with that.

629
00:56:20.372 --> 00:56:22.240
There he is.

630
00:56:48.533 --> 00:56:49.567
Get down.

631
00:56:56.207 --> 00:56:57.342
You're a pretty one. aren't ya?

632
00:56:57.875 --> 00:56:58.576
We're gonna have fun.

633
00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:06.051
You bitch!

634
00:57:23.268 --> 00:57:26.037
Nora. Arlene. stay here.

635
00:57:26.071 --> 00:57:26.971
Protect Jenny.

636
00:57:30.208 --> 00:57:31.176
We will. Ivan.

637
00:59:18.116 --> 00:59:19.150
It hurts.

638
00:59:20.585 --> 00:59:23.021
Relax your breathing
the best you can. Jenny. okay?

639
00:59:23.455 --> 00:59:25.256
- Okay?
- You're gonna be okay.

640
00:59:27.192 --> 00:59:28.359
Here. press on her wound.

641
00:59:30.595 --> 00:59:32.297
Sorry.

642
00:59:35.366 --> 00:59:37.001
Okay. just hold still. okay?

643
00:59:37.035 --> 00:59:39.304
- I need to close the wound.
- Okay.

644
00:59:40.338 --> 00:59:41.372
It's okay.

645
00:59:44.576 --> 00:59:46.077
She'll be okay.

646
00:59:46.110 --> 00:59:46.978
Promise. okay?

647
00:59:55.086 --> 00:59:56.187
Sheriff Kelly?

648
01:00:00.124 --> 01:00:02.460
Sheriff. it's me.
Reverend Andrew.

649
01:00:05.497 --> 01:00:07.465
I'm in a bit of a--
bit of a bind.

650
01:00:07.499 --> 01:00:10.168
there's someone here who wants
to talk to you about it.

651
01:00:13.671 --> 01:00:14.672
Sheriff Kelly?

652
01:00:16.641 --> 01:00:18.076
Don't you think
you ought to talk

653
01:00:18.109 --> 01:00:19.477
to the preacher man. Sheriff?

654
01:00:22.647 --> 01:00:24.315
Talk to the preacher
and see what he wants.

655
01:00:27.652 --> 01:00:29.187
Are you all right. preacher?

656
01:00:30.288 --> 01:00:31.356
You need to come out.

657
01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:43.801
Now. let's just
have us a talk here.

658
01:00:46.571 --> 01:00:48.606
No shooting at
each other for a minute.

659
01:00:49.307 --> 01:00:52.377
Just so you know.
we found your town folk.

660
01:00:53.845 --> 01:00:57.181
Yeah. they're all down
there hiding in the church.

661
01:00:57.582 --> 01:00:59.284
Now who the hell does that?

662
01:00:59.751 --> 01:01:02.086
Hide the town folk
in a goddamn church?

663
01:01:03.721 --> 01:01:05.256
You oughta be
ashamed of yourselves.

664
01:01:05.657 --> 01:01:06.791
What do you want?

665
01:01:07.392 --> 01:01:08.526
We want Colonel Crawley.

666
01:01:10.194 --> 01:01:11.629
Well. we ain't
gonna give 'im to you.

667
01:01:14.365 --> 01:01:15.533
Well now. that's not good.

668
01:01:17.335 --> 01:01:18.369
'Cause if you don't.

669
01:01:19.404 --> 01:01:21.806
I'm gonna torch
that church and everybody in it.

670
01:01:21.839 --> 01:01:23.541
We're gonna
shoot this preacher dead.

671
01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:30.715
I'm not gonna
dicker with you shit heels.

672
01:01:31.416 --> 01:01:32.850
You do what I say right now.

673
01:01:33.418 --> 01:01:34.852
or you know what's gonna happen.

674
01:01:37.188 --> 01:01:39.557
Unless you already
killed my Colonel. did you?

675
01:01:40.892 --> 01:01:43.227
Colonel Crawley.
can you hear me?

676
01:01:43.261 --> 01:01:44.429
Are you all right?

677
01:01:44.462 --> 01:01:46.431
Never been better.
Captain Grady.

678
01:01:53.304 --> 01:01:54.472
I don't know what to do.

679
01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:56.841
We can't release
Crawley to them.

680
01:01:56.874 --> 01:01:57.709
We can't.

681
01:01:59.510 --> 01:02:01.713
I can't just let
my whole town die.

682
01:02:01.746 --> 01:02:03.214
You can't trust them.

683
01:02:03.247 --> 01:02:04.782
I promise you they will
kill the town anyway.

684
01:02:05.416 --> 01:02:06.684
What's it gonna be?

685
01:02:06.718 --> 01:02:08.286
I ain't gonna wait much longer.

686
01:02:18.931 --> 01:02:20.865
Goddamn good work.
Captain Grady.

687
01:02:20.898 --> 01:02:21.733
Thank you. sir.

688
01:02:25.303 --> 01:02:25.903
Where is everyone?

689
01:02:26.471 --> 01:02:27.906
Dead. sir.

690
01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:30.742
Except for private Oakley and me

691
01:02:30.775 --> 01:02:32.510
and Corporal Waters
down at the church.

692
01:02:33.511 --> 01:02:36.848
This town's got this big
dumb German or Russian.

693
01:02:36.881 --> 01:02:39.550
whatever the hell
he is. he just won't die.

694
01:02:40.251 --> 01:02:41.452
He killed every
man I've thrown at him.

695
01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:42.921
He's a Russian.

696
01:02:44.689 --> 01:02:47.258
and he's crazy enough to
eat the devil with his horns.

697
01:02:51.796 --> 01:02:54.799
And he's no other than
General John Basil Turchin.

698
01:02:57.602 --> 01:02:58.903
The Rape of Athens general?

699
01:03:00.973 --> 01:03:02.306
That one.

700
01:03:03.708 --> 01:03:05.343
Now let me ask you a question.

701
01:03:06.011 --> 01:03:08.379
Do you think that son of a
bitch. Turchin. is still alive?

702
01:03:09.948 --> 01:03:11.282
I don't know. sir.

703
01:03:13.484 --> 01:03:16.387
Threw every man we had
at him. he killed 'em all.

704
01:03:20.558 --> 01:03:21.826
And now we have no men.

705
01:03:22.995 --> 01:03:26.497
Afraid not sir. other
than what I told you about.

706
01:03:26.831 --> 01:03:28.332
But I ain't seen
that Russian in a while.

707
01:03:28.366 --> 01:03:29.200
they might have got him.

708
01:03:30.735 --> 01:03:31.937
Somehow I don't think so.

709
01:03:35.873 --> 01:03:37.341
Send the preacher over here.

710
01:03:40.678 --> 01:03:43.715
You get that preacher
and your town folks back

711
01:03:44.049 --> 01:03:46.250
when I'm riding out
of this horseshit town.

712
01:03:46.284 --> 01:03:47.986
How about you both
just toss your guns out here?

713
01:03:51.389 --> 01:03:52.523
Well. then we'll just be

714
01:03:52.557 --> 01:03:54.358
hanging on to
the preacher for a while.

715
01:03:55.393 --> 01:03:57.328
Try to follow us.
he's a dead man.

716
01:03:57.361 --> 01:04:00.331
You close that goddamn door
and you stay inside.

717
01:04:00.364 --> 01:04:02.266
or I'm gonna burn
down that chapel myself.

718
01:04:03.401 --> 01:04:04.569
You understand what I'm saying?

719
01:04:06.004 --> 01:04:06.804
Let's go. come on.

720
01:04:15.379 --> 01:04:16.280
Release the preacher.

721
01:04:20.085 --> 01:04:23.755
Preacher. thank
you so much for your services.

722
01:04:25.890 --> 01:04:28.726
Now let's look at this
beautiful chapel you built.

723
01:04:30.828 --> 01:04:32.396
Town folks
waiting there for you.

724
01:04:33.631 --> 01:04:34.565
You know what I think?

725
01:04:36.534 --> 01:04:37.668
What?

726
01:04:38.369 --> 01:04:39.403
I think you should join them.

727
01:04:48.713 --> 01:04:49.915
You should join them in hell.

728
01:05:10.835 --> 01:05:12.670
What do you wanna
do about that. sir?

729
01:05:15.773 --> 01:05:17.575
I say we torch the church.

730
01:05:18.977 --> 01:05:20.078
Town folks inside.

731
01:05:21.612 --> 01:05:22.647
have a look.

732
01:05:24.816 --> 01:05:25.449
This.

733
01:05:26.784 --> 01:05:29.054
this is what hell looks like.

734
01:05:41.532 --> 01:05:43.668
Bet you never thought you'd go
out like this. did you asshole?

735
01:06:15.133 --> 01:06:16.801
You are wolf
when it comes to killing.

736
01:06:18.736 --> 01:06:19.670
I gotta hand you that.

737
01:06:20.872 --> 01:06:21.739
Not a bullet left.

738
01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:30.548
So you gonna
kill an unarmed man?

739
01:06:31.716 --> 01:06:33.684
Is that what
you are. a Russian coward?

740
01:09:27.892 --> 01:09:29.327
I told you. we're both killers.

741
01:09:31.196 --> 01:09:32.197
You and me.

742
01:09:34.632 --> 01:09:35.267
we are the same.

743
01:09:37.269 --> 01:09:38.103
No. we're not.

744
01:09:55.353 --> 01:09:56.887
I greatly appreciate you

745
01:09:56.922 --> 01:09:58.924
volunteering to
go along. General.

746
01:09:58.957 --> 01:10:00.125
I want to see justice served.

747
01:10:02.427 --> 01:10:03.627
So do I.

748
01:10:04.795 --> 01:10:06.198
I'd like to go
with you Marshal.

749
01:10:07.265 --> 01:10:08.799
but I've got this
town to look after.

750
01:10:09.968 --> 01:10:11.769
and I don't think
the Mayor's coming back.

751
01:10:12.437 --> 01:10:13.905
At least I hope not.

752
01:10:13.939 --> 01:10:15.140
Hope to see you one day.

753
01:10:16.241 --> 01:10:17.075
Likewise.

754
01:10:19.311 --> 01:10:20.678
Watch yourself. General.

755
01:10:21.879 --> 01:10:22.914
I will.
