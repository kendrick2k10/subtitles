00:00:34.208 --> 00:00:37.500
-Oh. oh. oh. oh.

4
00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:56.291
<i>What's great about</i>
<i>having an older brother</i>

5
00:00:56.375 --> 00:00:57.958
<i>is that they can teach you stuff.</i>

6
00:00:58.041 --> 00:01:00.166
<i>because they've gone through</i>
<i>all of it before you.</i>

7
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.208
<i>At least that's the way</i>
<i>it's supposed to be.</i>

8
00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:07.250
<i>But my brother Rodrick's too busy</i>
<i>to teach his little brother anything.</i>

9
00:01:09.708 --> 00:01:11.875
<i>I guess</i>
<i>I'm just not a big priority for him</i>

10
00:01:12.708 --> 00:01:15.208
<i>because all his free time</i>
<i>just goes to his band.</i>

11
00:01:17.625 --> 00:01:20.750
<i>The thing is. if Rodrick</i>
<i>would just take me under his wing.</i>

12
00:01:20.833 --> 00:01:22.666
<i>I could totally surprise him.</i>

13
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.875
<i>And that would really change things</i>
<i>for us.</i>

14
00:01:28.833 --> 00:01:31.416
<i>But I guess that's just not gonna happen.</i>

15
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.416
<i>And before long. Rodrick will move out.</i>

16
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.708
<i>and I'll have to figure things out</i>
<i>for myself.</i>

17
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.625
<i>But as long as the two of us are</i>
<i>living under the same roof.</i>

18
00:01:42.708 --> 00:01:45.833
<i>I'm gonna soak up every bit</i>
<i>of big brother knowledge I can get.</i>

<i>Player has received</i>
<i>Hammer of Ultimate Smashing!</i>

<i>Smash. smash…</i>

21
00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:08.583
Ooh. Ready. aim. fire!

22
00:02:08.666 --> 00:02:09.666
Manny!

23
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.833
Aw.

24
00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:13.416
Boys. the stuff in the dishwasher
is clean.

25
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.041
You just need to put the dishes away
before we get back.

26
00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:18.125
Okay. yeah.
I got your hair dryer and my belt.

27
00:02:18.208 --> 00:02:20.541
Um. was that-- Was--
Am I forgetting something?

28
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.666
Your pants?

29
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.333
Right. My pants.

30
00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:28.041
Wait. Where are you guys going again?

31
00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:32.291
Your father and I are going
into the city for our anniversary.

32
00:02:32.375 --> 00:02:35.708
You're going away? Like. overnight?

33
00:02:35.791 --> 00:02:37.250
Two nights. Greg.

34
00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:40.041
Come on. Greg.
We've been over this a hundred times.

35
00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:42.333
But-- But how are we gonna
take care of ourselves?

36
00:02:42.416 --> 00:02:43.875
What about Manny?

37
00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.375
-Manny's staying with Gramma.
-Hey!

38
00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:51.250
And you boys will be just fine.
I stocked up on groceries.

39
00:02:51.333 --> 00:02:52.541
-Groceries?

40
00:02:52.625 --> 00:02:53.750
Did you get snacks?

41
00:02:53.833 --> 00:02:55.625
-I refuse to buy junk food for you guys.

42
00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:59.208
I've told you before. if you want snacks.
you can buy them for yourselves.

43
00:02:59.291 --> 00:03:00.458
Mommy. gimme!

44
00:03:00.541 --> 00:03:02.041
Ugh. fine.

45
00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:05.625
-I'm cashing these in.

46
00:03:05.708 --> 00:03:09.250
250 Mom Bucks for 25 real ones.

47
00:03:09.333 --> 00:03:10.500
"Mom Bucks"?

48
00:03:13.833 --> 00:03:16.458
Oh. Yes. Frank.

49
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:19.708
The boys earn them by doing chores
and getting good grades.

50
00:03:19.791 --> 00:03:22.583
Wait. Then how did Rodrick get so many?

51
00:03:22.666 --> 00:03:24.125
Mind your own business.

52
00:03:25.458 --> 00:03:27.750
-Yuck.
-Rodrick should be earning real money.

53
00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:30.958
not play money with. you know.
like. a real job.

54
00:03:31.041 --> 00:03:33.916
When Löded Diper makes it big.
money won't be an issue.

55
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.333
Okay. And what if. just saying.
just putting it out there.

56
00:03:37.416 --> 00:03:40.500
what if your band doesn't make it big?
What's your plan then?

57
00:03:43.125 --> 00:03:46.750
I'll sell my hair for wigs
and fake mustaches and stuff.

58
00:03:47.625 --> 00:03:49.083
Well. that sounds foolproof.

59
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.041
Okay. time to go!
We've got dinner reservations.

60
00:03:55.125 --> 00:03:56.916
-See you boys Sunday!
-Whoo!

61
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.375
Mom!

62
00:03:58.458 --> 00:04:01.583
Now. we are trusting you
to be responsible this weekend.

63
00:04:01.666 --> 00:04:03.916
I don't want you doing anything
I wouldn't do. Got it?

64
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.166
Frank. we talked about this.

65
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.958
I-I just wanted to make sure
we're all on the same page.

66
00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:10.041
We good here?

67
00:04:11.541 --> 00:04:14.541
Okay? Okay. we're good.

68
00:04:14.625 --> 00:04:17.625
You can't leave me and Rodrick alone
together for a whole weekend.

69
00:04:17.708 --> 00:04:20.291
Mom. we literally don't even know
how to take care of ourselves!

70
00:04:20.375 --> 00:04:23.750
-Oh. come on. Greg. You two will have fun.

71
00:04:25.083 --> 00:04:28.583
Play some video games together.
Throw a ball in the backyard.

72
00:04:30.208 --> 00:04:31.625
Do you even know Rodrick?

73
00:04:32.625 --> 00:04:36.166
Listen. I know that you and your brother
don't always get along.

74
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.333
but a weekend like this
can help change that.

75
00:04:38.416 --> 00:04:40.500
-Yeah!
-Ow!

76
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.833
Who knows?
You two might surprise yourselves.

77
00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:52.875
Don't forget to unload the dishwasher!

78
00:04:54.625 --> 00:04:56.041
-Whoa!
-All right. Greg.

79
00:04:56.125 --> 00:04:57.791
We've got one hour
to get this place ready.

80
00:04:57.875 --> 00:04:59.125
Ready for what?

81
00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:00.916
The party.

82
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.250
What? No way! Mom and Dad
would never let you have a party!

83
00:05:05.333 --> 00:05:08.666
They'll never even know.
and it's not my party anyway.

84
00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.750
It's our party.

85
00:05:10.833 --> 00:05:13.250
Whoa. What do you mean "our party"?

86
00:05:13.333 --> 00:05:17.041
The Heffley brothers
are throwing this party together.

87
00:05:17.125 --> 00:05:18.833
The Heffley brothers?

88
00:05:19.375 --> 00:05:23.916
That's right. You and me. together.

89
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.875
People will be talking about this night
for years.

90
00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.666
It's gonna be epic.

91
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.041
Epic.

92
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.916
So. what do you say? Are you in?

93
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.500
Okay. I'm in.

94
00:05:39.583 --> 00:05:42.208
But who's coming to this thing?

95
00:05:42.291 --> 00:05:44.458
I invite my friends. You invite yours.

96
00:05:45.208 --> 00:05:48.083
W-Wait. Y-You do have friends. right?

97
00:05:48.166 --> 00:05:54.625
Yeah. I have lots of friends!
There's Rowley. and there's Rowley.

98
00:05:54.708 --> 00:05:57.125
Well. then.
why don't you call this "Rowley"

99
00:05:57.208 --> 00:05:58.916
and have him come over to help set up?

100
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.958
I don't know. I'm not sure Rowley
could really handle a high school party.

101
00:06:03.041 --> 00:06:05.250
Plus. his parents
would never let him come.

102
00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.125
So. you have him
tell them it's a sleepover.

103
00:06:08.208 --> 00:06:09.625
Come on. we need all the help we can get.

104
00:06:09.708 --> 00:06:12.166
Oh. That's pretty good.

105
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.708
And when he gets here. you guys can start
by bringing up one of those plastic tables

106
00:06:15.791 --> 00:06:16.791
from the basement.

107
00:06:16.875 --> 00:06:20.083
Wait. Why can't you do that?

108
00:06:20.166 --> 00:06:22.666
Because…

109
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.291
I can't do this without your help.

110
00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:29.000
And besides. I'm going to get snacks.

111
00:06:29.541 --> 00:06:32.416
Whoa! How do you have so many friends?

112
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.791
It's called popularity. You should try it.

113
00:06:36.625 --> 00:06:40.875
All right. The clock starts… now.

114
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.250
Now.

115
00:07:00.333 --> 00:07:02.458
-Whoa! Party at Rodrick's. dude!

116
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:04.250
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

117
00:07:05.333 --> 00:07:08.166
-…totally got their nose rings locked.

118
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.166
Whoa! Rager at Rodrick's!

119
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:11.625
-Yes!
-It's gonna be awesome!

120
00:07:11.708 --> 00:07:12.750
-Whoa!

121
00:07:14.458 --> 00:07:15.458
Party!

122
00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958
Hey. Greg! It's party time!

123
00:07:26.041 --> 00:07:29.458
No. no. no!

124
00:07:30.791 --> 00:07:33.666
Whoa! Rowley. what are you wearing?

125
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.875
You said this was a party.

126
00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.291
Not that kind of party.

127
00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:43.500
A cool party with. like. high schoolers.
and loud music and stuff.

128
00:07:44.208 --> 00:07:47.416
You mean a boy-girl party?

129
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.916
Rowley. don't call it a boy-girl party.

130
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.041
Why? Is it gonna be guys only?
'Cause that could be fun too.

131
00:07:54.708 --> 00:07:57.000
No. just call it a party. okay?

132
00:07:57.083 --> 00:08:00.375
And seriously. don't embarrass me tonight.

133
00:08:01.125 --> 00:08:04.666
It's just that
me and Rodrick never team up like this.

134
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.916
and I really don't want anything
to mess it up.

135
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.041
-Okay?
-Okay.

136
00:08:11.208 --> 00:08:14.041
All right.
You boys got your work cut out for ya.

137
00:08:16.166 --> 00:08:17.166
Get to it.

138
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:44.333
Ugh.

139
00:09:03.083 --> 00:09:04.333
Go! Go. go. go. go!

140
00:09:18.833 --> 00:09:20.333
-Ow!

141
00:09:20.416 --> 00:09:23.250
Hmm. Good job. guys.

142
00:09:23.833 --> 00:09:29.458
Huh. You know what. though?
We could use one more of those tables.

143
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:31.750
We're on it.

144
00:09:34.458 --> 00:09:38.208
Do we have to do this?
The first table was heavy.

145
00:09:38.291 --> 00:09:43.041
Everything's gotta be perfect!
Rodrick's. like. an expert at this stuff.

146
00:09:43.125 --> 00:09:47.458
But it seems like he's just getting us
to do all the hard stuff.

147
00:09:47.541 --> 00:09:51.250
You don't get it. Rowley.
Rodrick's depending on me.

148
00:09:51.333 --> 00:09:54.333
Our party's gonna be… epic.

149
00:10:05.791 --> 00:10:07.833
Um.

150
00:10:22.458 --> 00:10:23.791
Whoa.

151
00:10:30.541 --> 00:10:32.666
I don't think
we should be in Rodrick's bedroom.

152
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:35.625
Relax. we're just in here for the table.

153
00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:40.916
Do you think
there will be party games.

154
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.375
like charades
or pin the tail on the donkey?

155
00:10:45.833 --> 00:10:47.708
It's not that kind of thing. Rowley.

156
00:10:47.791 --> 00:10:50.791
High-school parties are totally different
than little-kid parties.

157
00:10:50.875 --> 00:10:52.041
How do you know?

158
00:10:52.125 --> 00:10:54.291
I just know stuff.

159
00:10:54.375 --> 00:10:56.833
Listen. we're gonna be
the only middle schoolers at this thing.

160
00:10:56.916 --> 00:11:00.333
We've gotta blend in.
Just try and be cool. okay?

161
00:11:00.416 --> 00:11:03.458
But pin the tail on the donkey is cool.

162
00:11:05.625 --> 00:11:06.625
Wait. what?

163
00:11:11.916 --> 00:11:15.625
"See you after the party."

164
00:11:16.583 --> 00:11:17.583
Oh. no.

165
00:11:18.166 --> 00:11:20.208
What's going on? Is it stuck?

166
00:11:20.291 --> 00:11:23.500
It's not stuck!
I think Rodrick locked the door.

167
00:11:23.583 --> 00:11:25.666
But why would he do that?

168
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:28.291
What about the party?
What about the Heffley brothers?

169
00:11:29.875 --> 00:11:32.583
It was. uh. probably just a joke.

170
00:11:32.666 --> 00:11:36.875
Rodrick? Rodrick!

171
00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:40.250
Rodrick!

172
00:11:42.458 --> 00:11:43.708
Rodrick!

173
00:11:45.541 --> 00:11:46.625
Rodrick!

174
00:12:00.625 --> 00:12:01.625
Rodrick!

175
00:12:02.416 --> 00:12:03.416
Is he coming?

176
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:04.625
Just wait here. okay?

177
00:12:07.041 --> 00:12:09.166
But I have tap-dancing lessons
in the morning.

178
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:10.375
I was sick last week.

179
00:12:10.458 --> 00:12:14.583
and if I miss two in a row.
Miss Tilly's gonna be mad.

180
00:12:14.666 --> 00:12:17.166
Relax. Rowley.
I've got everything under control.

181
00:12:18.041 --> 00:12:19.041
Hmm.

182
00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.916
I'm scared. What if we starve down here?

183
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.958
-My celery sticks are in my overnight bag.

184
00:12:28.041 --> 00:12:31.416
Can you please stop talking
for five seconds? I need to concentrate.

185
00:12:37.833 --> 00:12:41.458
What's going on out there?
Are they… partying?

186
00:12:43.416 --> 00:12:47.000
I think I can reach the lock.

187
00:12:48.416 --> 00:12:49.583
Ow!

188
00:12:53.666 --> 00:12:55.000
Can you reach it?

189
00:12:55.083 --> 00:12:56.083
No.

190
00:12:56.166 --> 00:12:59.833
But I've got an idea. Wait here.

191
00:13:04.208 --> 00:13:06.000
Let's get this party started!

192
00:13:07.583 --> 00:13:09.916
-Whoo!
-Nice brain bucket.

193
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.583
And I was like.
"Underwear goes under your pants. bro."

194
00:13:13.666 --> 00:13:14.500
Ew!

195
00:13:19.458 --> 00:13:20.625
Whoa.

196
00:13:22.416 --> 00:13:23.708
-Whoa.

197
00:13:24.625 --> 00:13:25.625
Move.

198
00:13:30.625 --> 00:13:31.666
What's that for?

199
00:13:33.708 --> 00:13:34.958
Evidence.

200
00:13:36.166 --> 00:13:37.791
Whoa.

201
00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:42.750
-Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

202
00:13:43.708 --> 00:13:44.875
He actually did it!

203
00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.416
Yeah!

204
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:47.833
Whoa!

205
00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:50.333
Huh? What--

206
00:14:04.541 --> 00:14:05.541
Whoa!

207
00:14:05.625 --> 00:14:06.625
-Ow!

208
00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:08.250
What?

209
00:14:08.333 --> 00:14:09.416
-Ew!

210
00:14:11.583 --> 00:14:13.916
I think I'd better go home.

211
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.291
Yeah. that might be a good idea.

212
00:14:54.208 --> 00:14:56.666
Dude.

213
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:58.125
Not cool. dude.

214
00:15:00.666 --> 00:15:02.166
-Not cool.

215
00:15:03.708 --> 00:15:05.458
-My head.

216
00:15:05.541 --> 00:15:07.458
-This sucks.
-Not cool.

217
00:15:15.375 --> 00:15:19.125
What's your problem. man?

218
00:15:19.666 --> 00:15:22.750
It's not even. like. afternoon yet.

219
00:15:22.833 --> 00:15:25.125
You locked me in the basement!

220
00:15:25.208 --> 00:15:28.583
Yeah. like. as a joke.

221
00:15:28.666 --> 00:15:33.875
Well. the joke's on you. because
when Mom and Dad get home tomorrow.

222
00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.375
I'm gonna tell them
all about your little party.

223
00:15:39.708 --> 00:15:41.833
You wouldn't have the guts.

224
00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.083
Hey. Mom. How is the trip going?

225
00:15:48.166 --> 00:15:51.833
Well-- Well. it was going great
until Manny got a stomach bug.

226
00:15:51.916 --> 00:15:53.541
We're headed to Gramma's to pick him up.

227
00:15:53.625 --> 00:15:56.125
Wait. You're coming home today?

228
00:15:56.208 --> 00:15:57.333
-Yes. Rodrick.
-Got it.

229
00:15:57.416 --> 00:15:58.916
We should be home in an hour.

230
00:15:59.541 --> 00:16:01.583
Did you boys empty the dishwasher
like I asked?

231
00:16:01.666 --> 00:16:02.833
You gotta be kidding me.

232
00:16:04.375 --> 00:16:06.625
Not yet.

233
00:16:06.708 --> 00:16:09.416
<i>Well. it had better be done</i>
<i>by the time we're back.</i>

234
00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.041
No problem. See you soon.

235
00:16:13.208 --> 00:16:18.500
Okay. you heard her. We've got one hour
to clean up this whole mess.

236
00:16:22.125 --> 00:16:25.333
Not my problem. I'll be in my room.

237
00:16:25.833 --> 00:16:26.833
Dude!

238
00:16:26.916 --> 00:16:31.083
Mom and Dad are gonna go ballistic
if they find out I had a party!

239
00:16:31.166 --> 00:16:33.250
Please. you've gotta help me.

240
00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:36.500
And why would I do that?

241
00:16:38.791 --> 00:16:39.875
Because we're brothers.

242
00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:43.500
Yeah. well. brothers don't lock each other
in the basement.

243
00:16:43.583 --> 00:16:48.208
Okay. okay. I slipped up.
Won't happen again. I swear.

244
00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:50.958
Please!

245
00:16:51.833 --> 00:16:56.041
If I help you clean up this mess.
things are gonna be different between us.

246
00:16:56.125 --> 00:16:58.375
Different? Like how?

247
00:16:58.458 --> 00:17:02.625
For starters. you're gonna start
treating me better. like an equal.

248
00:17:02.708 --> 00:17:06.208
Okay. okay. Done. Equals. Got it.

249
00:17:06.791 --> 00:17:08.083
And you're gonna owe me.

250
00:17:08.166 --> 00:17:09.916
Owe you what?

251
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:11.750
I'm-- I'm-- I'm thinking.

252
00:17:11.833 --> 00:17:13.875
Dude. we've got no time!

253
00:17:16.166 --> 00:17:20.666
Okay. Yeah. I owe you.
Can we just work out the details later?

254
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:22.250
Fine.

255
00:17:22.333 --> 00:17:24.916
All right. my man! Let's do this.

256
00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:28.000
And go!

257
00:17:37.083 --> 00:17:38.625
-What?
-Hmm.

258
00:17:39.416 --> 00:17:40.791
-Hmm.

259
00:17:40.875 --> 00:17:43.291
Gonna blow chunks!

260
00:17:43.375 --> 00:17:45.708
Don't worry. Manny.
We'll be home in a jiffy.

261
00:17:46.875 --> 00:17:48.625
Honey. better step on it.

262
00:17:49.458 --> 00:17:51.916
-Whoa!

263
00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:01.166
I am taking the shortcut!

264
00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:05.083
Whoa!

265
00:18:08.375 --> 00:18:09.541
Manny!

266
00:18:14.666 --> 00:18:16.166
Huh? What?

267
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:18.041
Whoa!

268
00:18:19.916 --> 00:18:21.166
Ouch!

269
00:18:38.208 --> 00:18:40.375
-Whoa. whoa. whoa.

270
00:19:04.166 --> 00:19:06.333
Mission accomplished. little bro.

271
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:28.583
It's permanent ink!
This is never coming off!

272
00:19:28.666 --> 00:19:29.666
Um--

273
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:31.166
We need another door!

274
00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:34.375
Another door?
Where are we gonna get another door?

275
00:19:34.458 --> 00:19:37.416
The basement!
Go. go. go. go. go. go. go!

276
00:19:49.666 --> 00:19:51.625
Oh. let's hurry up and get you inside.

277
00:19:53.958 --> 00:19:55.375
Quit pushing!

278
00:19:55.458 --> 00:19:57.458
Quit pulling! Push!

279
00:19:57.541 --> 00:19:58.750
I said pull!

280
00:19:58.833 --> 00:19:59.833
Ow!

281
00:20:02.291 --> 00:20:03.708
Come on. Frank.

282
00:20:14.333 --> 00:20:15.458
Boys?

283
00:20:18.541 --> 00:20:19.708
We're home!

284
00:20:19.791 --> 00:20:21.583
Oh. Hey. Mom!

285
00:20:22.666 --> 00:20:26.083
So. did you guys do some brotherly bonding
while we were gone?

286
00:20:26.166 --> 00:20:27.916
Uh. kinda. I guess.

287
00:20:28.625 --> 00:20:30.666
Rodrick. y-you're sweating!

288
00:20:31.291 --> 00:20:33.958
Oh. I hope you don't have what Manny has.

289
00:20:34.041 --> 00:20:35.458
I knew it. Susan!

290
00:20:35.958 --> 00:20:38.166
I knew they couldn't be trusted!

291
00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:40.041
They didn't empty the dishwasher.

292
00:20:42.666 --> 00:20:44.916
-Oh. that's gross.
-Manny all better!

293
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.583
Oh.

294
00:21:01.666 --> 00:21:03.166
Oh. man!

295
00:21:05.333 --> 00:21:06.458
Hmm.

296
00:21:06.958 --> 00:21:12.125
There's gotta be evidence.
They're not that smart.

297
00:21:13.291 --> 00:21:14.291
Aha!

298
00:21:31.291 --> 00:21:33.916
You think he knows? I-- I think he knows!

299
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.416
Shh! Keep your voice down. dummy.

300
00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.000
If he doesn't know.
he's gonna figure it out.

301
00:21:39.083 --> 00:21:42.166
I mean. he's been sniffing around
the house ever since he got back.

302
00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:43.916
He's gonna find something.

303
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.625
You need to calm down. We covered
our tracks. We cleaned up the place.

304
00:21:48.708 --> 00:21:50.500
Yeah. and you owe me for that.

305
00:21:50.583 --> 00:21:53.583
And you can start paying me back
by finishing with these leaves!

306
00:21:53.666 --> 00:21:57.041
Wait. wait. wait.
What-- What is this about owing you?

307
00:21:57.125 --> 00:21:59.583
I don't remember saying
anything like that.

308
00:22:00.583 --> 00:22:04.666
Are you kidding me? I cleaned up
your stupid party. and that wasn't easy!

309
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:09.708
Don't you mean our party?
We were partners in this thing.

310
00:22:09.791 --> 00:22:11.958
That mess was our mess.

311
00:22:12.041 --> 00:22:15.916
and if Mom and Dad ever find out about it.
we're both in hot water.

312
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.500
No way! This was your party!

313
00:22:18.583 --> 00:22:21.041
You're the one who's getting in trouble.
not me!

314
00:22:21.125 --> 00:22:23.666
I'm gonna tell Mom and Dad
what really happened.

315
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:30.791
Fine. fine. I'll pay up.

316
00:22:31.625 --> 00:22:33.708
Yeah? And how are you gonna do that?

317
00:22:34.416 --> 00:22:38.500
By giving you my most valuable possession.

318
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.625
What? Mom Bucks?

319
00:22:40.708 --> 00:22:43.333
No. thanks. I've seen where you keep them.

320
00:22:43.416 --> 00:22:48.000
Something even better than that.
Knowledge.

321
00:22:48.083 --> 00:22:50.000
I've seen your report card.

322
00:22:50.083 --> 00:22:55.625
Not school knowledge. Real knowledge.
Stuff you can actually use.

323
00:22:55.708 --> 00:22:56.958
I'm listening.

324
00:22:57.041 --> 00:22:59.000
I'll give you a little taste.

325
00:22:59.083 --> 00:23:01.250
Let's start with the way
you bag your leaves.

326
00:23:01.333 --> 00:23:05.166
When you do it. you fill your bag
to the top and then tie it shut.

327
00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:07.041
But that's not smart.

328
00:23:07.125 --> 00:23:09.708
Mom's paying three Mom Bucks a bag.

329
00:23:09.791 --> 00:23:13.875
So. if you wanna maximize your income.
you've gotta do it like this.

330
00:23:17.916 --> 00:23:20.083
But isn't that cheating?

331
00:23:20.166 --> 00:23:23.166
It's not cheating.
It's just gaming the system.

332
00:23:23.875 --> 00:23:26.541
So. what? You're just gonna give me
a bunch of yard work tips?

333
00:23:26.625 --> 00:23:28.916
I can teach you lots of things.
little brother.

334
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.166
Stuff that'll make your whole life easier.

335
00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:34.625
Your problem is that you work too hard.

336
00:23:34.708 --> 00:23:37.500
I want that underwear off the table

337
00:23:37.583 --> 00:23:39.833
by the time I get back
from the grocery store.

338
00:23:39.916 --> 00:23:42.791
-<i>What you do is set the bar low.</i>

339
00:23:42.875 --> 00:23:45.000
<i>so Mom and Dad don't expect</i>
<i>too much out of you.</i>

340
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:46.833
<i>Because then…</i>

341
00:23:48.375 --> 00:23:49.375
Wha--

342
00:23:49.458 --> 00:23:52.541
<i>…they're happy</i>
<i>when you do practically nothing at all.</i>

343
00:23:52.625 --> 00:23:53.625
<i>Here's another tip.</i>

344
00:23:54.208 --> 00:23:56.000
<i>Pretend you don't know how to do stuff.</i>

345
00:23:56.083 --> 00:23:58.708
<i>because that'll get you out of</i>
<i>a lot of unnecessary work.</i>

346
00:23:58.791 --> 00:24:00.916
H…

347
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:04.333
H… Hmm.

348
00:24:05.375 --> 00:24:06.875
I'll just do it. okay?

349
00:24:09.666 --> 00:24:12.500
<i>And if you really</i>
<i>don't feel like doing something.</i>

350
00:24:12.583 --> 00:24:15.541
<i>a well-timed trip to the bathroom</i>
<i>is always your ticket out.</i>

351
00:24:15.625 --> 00:24:16.958
I'm ready to start!

352
00:24:17.041 --> 00:24:18.541
I just finished.

353
00:24:19.041 --> 00:24:21.208
My body is on a schedule.

354
00:24:23.958 --> 00:24:27.125
Okay. I'll admit it. That's--
That's pretty good.

355
00:24:27.208 --> 00:24:28.333
What else can you teach me?

356
00:24:28.416 --> 00:24:33.125
Oh. I've got loads of stuff like that.
I call it my Rodrick Rules.

357
00:24:34.333 --> 00:24:36.791
Don't you mean "Rodrick's Rules"?

358
00:24:36.875 --> 00:24:41.791
No. Rodrick Rules.
There's only one Rodrick. me.

359
00:24:41.875 --> 00:24:42.750
Yeah.

360
00:24:42.833 --> 00:24:45.291
I meant. like. apostrophe S.

361
00:24:45.375 --> 00:24:49.375
Rodrick Rule number one.
No apostrophes or any other nerd stuff.

362
00:24:50.416 --> 00:24:53.041
That kinda stuff will get you beat up
at school.

363
00:24:53.125 --> 00:24:54.583
So. what's rule number two?

364
00:24:54.666 --> 00:24:57.541
Uh. I've already given away too much.

365
00:24:57.625 --> 00:25:01.625
If you want more. we're gonna have to
make this deal official.

366
00:25:02.125 --> 00:25:07.333
You keep your mouth shut about the party.
and I'll tell you everything I know.

367
00:25:08.458 --> 00:25:09.458
Deal.

368
00:25:23.875 --> 00:25:27.291
Greg. Rowley's here! Time to go!

369
00:25:28.458 --> 00:25:32.250
Hello. Rowley. Don't you look handsome?

370
00:25:33.416 --> 00:25:39.041
Um. this weekend I had tap-dancing lessons
with Miss Tilly.

371
00:25:39.125 --> 00:25:41.833
Uh. nothing out of the ordinary happened.

372
00:25:46.875 --> 00:25:48.500
-Whoa. Hey. Rowley!

373
00:25:48.583 --> 00:25:51.791
It's been a while.
Friday afternoon. right?

374
00:25:51.875 --> 00:25:52.916
Yeah. we--

375
00:25:53.416 --> 00:25:57.333
-Whoa! So clean.
-Uh…

376
00:25:57.416 --> 00:26:00.708
Yeah. yeah. Time to go. Rowley!
Time-- Time to go. Get out.

377
00:26:02.458 --> 00:26:04.666
Come on. Rowley.
Two more seconds in there.

378
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:06.958
and you were gonna spill your guts
about the whole party.

379
00:26:07.041 --> 00:26:10.333
Sorry. I'm not good at this stuff.

380
00:26:10.416 --> 00:26:12.833
You don't think my dad heard you
back there. right?

381
00:26:12.916 --> 00:26:15.416
'Cause he's been acting really suspicious.

382
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.833
How did you get the house so clean.
though?

383
00:26:18.333 --> 00:26:21.416
Um. me and Rodrick
actually did it together.

384
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.375
I told you. me and him are a team.

385
00:26:23.458 --> 00:26:26.791
You and Rodrick?
But he locked us in the basement!

386
00:26:26.875 --> 00:26:30.458
Uh. yeah.
Brothers just joke like that.

387
00:26:30.541 --> 00:26:33.291
It's actually pretty hilarious
if you really think about it.

388
00:26:34.708 --> 00:26:35.958
Don't look at me like that.

389
00:26:36.875 --> 00:26:40.000
Anyway. yeah. Rodrick's been. uh--
He's been taking me under his wing.

390
00:26:40.083 --> 00:26:41.958
He's been teaching me a bunch of stuff.

391
00:26:42.458 --> 00:26:44.500
Really? What kind of stuff?

392
00:26:44.583 --> 00:26:47.000
Uh. like. how you need to set the bar low.

393
00:26:47.083 --> 00:26:49.041
so your parents don't expect
too much from you.

394
00:26:49.125 --> 00:26:52.250
Oh. and how you can trick them
into helping you with your homework.

395
00:26:52.333 --> 00:26:53.625
That kind of thing.

396
00:26:54.333 --> 00:26:56.750
That seems like bad stuff.

397
00:26:56.833 --> 00:26:59.083
This information is like gold. Rowley!

398
00:26:59.166 --> 00:27:01.291
It's what makes having an older brother
worth it.

399
00:27:03.375 --> 00:27:06.208
But why is Rodrick being so nice to you
all of a sudden?

400
00:27:08.375 --> 00:27:11.666
I don't know. Maybe 'cause he just likes
having me around.

401
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:14.666
You know what? You wouldn't understand.
You're an only child.

402
00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:15.750
No offense.

403
00:27:16.416 --> 00:27:23.166
Well. I'm glad I'm an only child.
'Cause this brother stuff is complicated.

404
00:27:53.833 --> 00:27:55.000
Rodrick!

405
00:27:57.291 --> 00:27:58.583
Rodrick!

406
00:28:00.041 --> 00:28:01.333
Rodrick!

407
00:28:05.125 --> 00:28:06.375
What?

408
00:28:06.458 --> 00:28:10.875
You need to teach me something new.
You never got past rule number one.

409
00:28:10.958 --> 00:28:14.250
You only get one rule a week.
That's Rodrick Rule number two.

410
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:18.333
What? That's not fair.

411
00:28:18.416 --> 00:28:19.833
Life's not fair.

412
00:28:21.833 --> 00:28:24.583
Rule number three.
And now you made me break rule number two.

413
00:28:24.666 --> 00:28:26.458
Fine.

414
00:28:28.041 --> 00:28:29.250
Ow! What the--

415
00:28:29.333 --> 00:28:31.250
I've been looking for that.

416
00:28:31.333 --> 00:28:32.333
What is this?

417
00:28:32.416 --> 00:28:34.458
It's an echo pedal. We need it…

418
00:28:34.541 --> 00:28:37.458
…for the talent show.

419
00:28:37.541 --> 00:28:41.375
Oh. yeah. the talent show.
I'm trying out too.

420
00:28:41.458 --> 00:28:44.541
You? You don't have any talent.

421
00:28:45.833 --> 00:28:48.750
Yeah. I'm in Rowley's magic act.

422
00:28:48.833 --> 00:28:50.416
<i>I'm his…</i>

423
00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:51.583
<i>assistant.</i>

424
00:28:54.958 --> 00:28:59.041
Man. they're--
they're gonna laugh you off the stage.

425
00:28:59.125 --> 00:29:02.125
Yeah. I know. Mom's making me.

426
00:29:03.041 --> 00:29:05.208
Hey. do you think
you can get me out of this?

427
00:29:05.291 --> 00:29:08.958
Sorry. you c--
You can't leave your friends hanging.

428
00:29:09.041 --> 00:29:10.208
Rodrick Rule number four.

429
00:29:10.291 --> 00:29:14.125
All right. enough with the rules.
How about you teach me something for real?

430
00:29:14.208 --> 00:29:15.416
Like what?

431
00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:16.833
I don't know.

432
00:29:17.625 --> 00:29:21.666
Maybe you could teach me
how to play the drums or something.

433
00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:27.375
Are you sure
you could handle that. little brother?

434
00:29:28.416 --> 00:29:29.833
-Yeah!
-All right.

435
00:29:30.541 --> 00:29:31.541
It's simple.

436
00:29:31.625 --> 00:29:37.708
You just gotta grip the sticks.
feel the flow. and let it rip.

437
00:29:41.041 --> 00:29:46.708
Okay. now loosen up that wrist a bit.
Keep it flowing. Feel the rhythm.

438
00:29:46.791 --> 00:29:50.916
That-- Th-That's it!
You've got potential. little bro.

439
00:29:53.416 --> 00:29:56.833
Are you ready to rock?

440
00:29:57.708 --> 00:30:00.333
<i>Bill Walter</i>
<i>is the lead singer of Löded Diper.</i>

441
00:30:00.416 --> 00:30:03.208
<i>even though</i>
<i>he's something like 35 years old.</i>

442
00:30:03.291 --> 00:30:05.375
<i>I'm pretty sure Rodrick asked him to join</i>

443
00:30:05.458 --> 00:30:08.250
<i>because he got named</i>
<i>"Most Likely to Be a Rock Star"</i>

444
00:30:08.333 --> 00:30:10.416
<i>when he was in high school.</i>

445
00:30:13.125 --> 00:30:15.708
Beat it. kid. Grown-ups are talking here.

446
00:30:17.458 --> 00:30:21.208
Nah. that-- That's all right.
He can stay. He's cool.

447
00:30:24.041 --> 00:30:25.708
Whatever you say. dude.

448
00:30:25.791 --> 00:30:27.875
You ready to burn this place down?

449
00:30:27.958 --> 00:30:29.875
We are Löded Diper!

450
00:30:29.958 --> 00:30:31.416
One. two. three. four!

451
00:30:41.833 --> 00:30:44.500
-Huh?

452
00:30:55.333 --> 00:30:58.166
Isn't setting the table Greg's job?

453
00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:00.541
He's hanging out with his brother
in the basement.

454
00:31:01.041 --> 00:31:03.666
I didn't want to interrupt
their "together time."

455
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:05.708
Listen. I--

456
00:31:05.791 --> 00:31:09.458
Do you think it's a good idea that those
guys are spending so much time together?

457
00:31:09.541 --> 00:31:11.708
Why wouldn't it be a good idea?

458
00:31:13.833 --> 00:31:16.083
It's just that-- Well. I mean--

459
00:31:16.166 --> 00:31:19.625
Look. who knows what kind of stuff
Rodrick is teaching Greg?

460
00:31:19.708 --> 00:31:21.958
-Somebody farted!

461
00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:24.750
Ew. gross.

462
00:31:27.833 --> 00:31:30.416
-Somebody farted!

463
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:34.333
I rest my case.

464
00:31:34.416 --> 00:31:36.708
The boys are bonding. Frank.

465
00:31:36.791 --> 00:31:38.958
Isn't that what we want to happen?

466
00:31:39.666 --> 00:31:44.125
Look. sometimes my older brother. Joe.
would string me along.

467
00:31:44.208 --> 00:31:45.750
and then I'd get burned.

468
00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:48.041
Greg needs to protect himself.

469
00:31:48.125 --> 00:31:51.791
Because if Rodrick pulls the rug out
from under him. he's gonna get hurt.

470
00:31:51.875 --> 00:31:55.625
We can't police every interaction
between these boys. Frank.

471
00:31:56.208 --> 00:31:57.875
They need to work things out on their own.

472
00:31:57.958 --> 00:32:01.416
Maybe you're right.
But I just-- I--

473
00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:04.666
Now why don't you just take off that tie.
and try and relax a little?

474
00:32:05.666 --> 00:32:09.083
I'll. uh. go get washed up for dinner.

475
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:21.583
Hey! Didn't this door used to lock?

476
00:32:24.125 --> 00:32:25.250
So. you guys are telling us

477
00:32:25.333 --> 00:32:29.458
that you have no idea why
the bathroom door suddenly doesn't lock?

478
00:32:29.541 --> 00:32:33.375
Wait. We have a bathroom on this floor?

479
00:32:33.458 --> 00:32:38.458
I feel like there's something
the boys aren't telling us.

480
00:32:39.041 --> 00:32:41.833
Greg. would you like to say something?

481
00:32:43.625 --> 00:32:44.625
Um…

482
00:32:47.583 --> 00:32:51.333
Actually. something did happen
on Friday night.

483
00:32:51.916 --> 00:32:53.583
Something I should've told you about.

484
00:32:58.833 --> 00:33:01.541
I went in the bathroom.
and I tried to lock the door.

485
00:33:01.625 --> 00:33:02.625
But I couldn't.

486
00:33:03.666 --> 00:33:07.500
I think I must have broken it
by shutting it too hard or something.

487
00:33:07.583 --> 00:33:08.583
Sorry.

488
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:18.375
Okay. Mystery solved. Let's move on.

489
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000
Nice save.

490
00:33:20.666 --> 00:33:25.916
Boys. your father and I are taking another
shot at celebrating our anniversary

491
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.333
since our first attempt got cut short.

492
00:33:28.416 --> 00:33:30.750
You're going away this weekend?

493
00:33:30.833 --> 00:33:32.666
Yes. but don't worry.

494
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:34.958
You see. we're not gonna leave you two
on your own again.

495
00:33:35.041 --> 00:33:36.416
Why? Who's coming over?

496
00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:40.625
You two boys are gonna visit your grandpa.

497
00:33:40.708 --> 00:33:44.166
Wait. At Leisure Towers?
But there's nothing to do there.

498
00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:47.166
Oh. there's plenty to do
at Grandpa's complex.

499
00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:50.000
Shuffleboard. bingo. the pool.

500
00:33:50.083 --> 00:33:53.375
And you know how much
my dad loves board games!

501
00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:55.500
Board games?

502
00:33:55.583 --> 00:33:56.583
Come on. guys.

503
00:33:56.666 --> 00:34:00.000
You know Grandpa appreciates it
when you spend time with him.

504
00:34:00.083 --> 00:34:01.958
-But--
-Mom's right. Greg.

505
00:34:02.041 --> 00:34:04.500
It's been way too long
since we paid Grandpa a visit.

506
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.708
This-- This is gonna be great.

507
00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.958
Okay. guys. Better get packed.

508
00:34:12.708 --> 00:34:14.291
Greg. I'll help you.

509
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.583
-Rodrick?
-Yeah?

510
00:34:16.666 --> 00:34:18.000
Good role modeling.

511
00:34:18.625 --> 00:34:20.750
Well. I try.

512
00:34:29.208 --> 00:34:30.916
Ready. set. go!

513
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.916
Whoo-hoo! Whee!

514
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.250
-Aha!

515
00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:39.541
-Ooh. Hey!

516
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.250
Dagnabbit!

517
00:34:44.416 --> 00:34:48.541
Okay. boys! This is Gutbusters!

518
00:34:48.625 --> 00:34:53.000
One player reads a card.
and the other players try not to laugh.

519
00:34:53.083 --> 00:34:54.208
Them's the rules!

520
00:34:54.291 --> 00:34:56.333
-That sounds so fun!

521
00:34:56.416 --> 00:34:58.416
-Roll the dice. Grandpa!

522
00:34:59.708 --> 00:35:01.875
Ha! Snake eyes!

523
00:35:01.958 --> 00:35:03.208
It's your turn to read. Greg.

524
00:35:03.291 --> 00:35:09.458
"A man who would pun.
would just as easily pick a pocket."

525
00:35:15.541 --> 00:35:17.000
Huh? I don't get it.

526
00:35:20.166 --> 00:35:21.458
Come on. Rodrick!

527
00:35:21.541 --> 00:35:23.208
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

528
00:35:23.291 --> 00:35:25.583
I'm sorry.
I-- I-- I-I-I couldn't help it.

529
00:35:25.666 --> 00:35:27.708
That one gets me every time.

530
00:35:27.791 --> 00:35:29.791
All right. boys.

531
00:35:29.875 --> 00:35:35.166
Now. why don't you clean up this mess
while I take a potty break?

532
00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:39.000
Okay. Grandpa.
But don't take too long in there.

533
00:35:40.875 --> 00:35:43.041
I can't believe you agreed to coming here.

534
00:35:43.125 --> 00:35:45.333
Why didn't you at least try
to get us out of it?

535
00:35:45.416 --> 00:35:49.041
Can't talk. Concentrating.

536
00:35:49.875 --> 00:35:51.916
Rodrick. what are you doing?

537
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.583
Isn't one game enough?

538
00:35:55.125 --> 00:35:57.375
You think I'm here to play games?

539
00:35:58.208 --> 00:36:00.833
Are those Mom Bucks?

540
00:36:00.916 --> 00:36:02.958
Millions of dollars worth.

541
00:36:05.916 --> 00:36:08.250
That's amazing. Wow!

542
00:36:08.333 --> 00:36:11.375
So. this is why you wanted to come
to Leisure Towers.

543
00:36:11.458 --> 00:36:14.291
Bingo. Now you're starting to get it.

544
00:36:14.375 --> 00:36:15.916
Come on. Let's split it up.

545
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.875
-Ah! Da. da. da. da! Not so fast.

546
00:36:18.958 --> 00:36:20.250
Go find your own supply.

547
00:36:20.333 --> 00:36:22.833
Come on. Rodrick. You owe me.

548
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:28.250
Fine. here's a hundred.
Don't spend it all in one place.

549
00:36:29.125 --> 00:36:32.583
Now. why don't you go change?
You look like you wet yourself.

550
00:36:32.666 --> 00:36:34.833
I can't. Grandpa's in the bathroom.

551
00:36:34.916 --> 00:36:36.916
Then use the one in the lobby.

552
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:40.333
<i>I've gotta hand it</i>
<i>to Rodrick on this Mom Bucks thing.</i>

553
00:36:40.416 --> 00:36:42.500
<i>Every time</i>
<i>I think I've figured him all out.</i>

554
00:36:42.583 --> 00:36:44.125
<i>he surprises me with something new.</i>

555
00:36:44.916 --> 00:36:47.625
It's pea soup again tonight. I hear.

556
00:36:47.708 --> 00:36:50.083
That sounds pretty good to me.

557
00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:53.625
Huh?

558
00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.333
Oh. my.

559
00:37:09.458 --> 00:37:11.750
Hi. Merle! Going to bingo tonight?

560
00:37:11.833 --> 00:37:13.583
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

561
00:37:13.666 --> 00:37:16.708
Well. you can kiss
your winning streak goodbye.

562
00:37:16.791 --> 00:37:18.958
I'm bringing a good luck charm with me.

563
00:37:19.041 --> 00:37:21.541
-Oh! Isn't he cute?

564
00:37:21.625 --> 00:37:25.291
Merle. Irene. bingo tonight?

565
00:37:25.375 --> 00:37:26.708
Ha! We'll see.

566
00:37:26.791 --> 00:37:32.500
Can you believe my luck last week?
Two games in a row.

567
00:37:32.583 --> 00:37:36.833
It was all thanks to my lucky charm.

568
00:37:48.333 --> 00:37:50.083
Say…

569
00:37:50.166 --> 00:37:52.208
"Boys size small?"

570
00:37:52.291 --> 00:37:54.375
A Peeping Tom!

571
00:37:58.583 --> 00:38:02.083
We see you in there. Boy Size Small!

572
00:38:02.166 --> 00:38:05.000
We're gonna hand you over
to the authorities!

573
00:38:05.083 --> 00:38:07.208
They'll put you in the slammer!

574
00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:13.208
-Where did he go?
-I don't see him.

575
00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:14.708
Did he give us the slip?

576
00:38:16.958 --> 00:38:18.125
-There he is!

577
00:38:18.208 --> 00:38:20.291
He's on the move. ladies!

578
00:38:30.166 --> 00:38:31.250
After him!

579
00:38:32.708 --> 00:38:34.916
-Huh? Huh?

580
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.375
-We're coming through!
-Hey! Watch it!

581
00:38:37.458 --> 00:38:39.541
-Don't let him get away!

582
00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:47.208
-You get out of here!

583
00:38:48.375 --> 00:38:50.000
Killing my bingo buzz!

584
00:38:50.083 --> 00:38:51.750
There he is!

585
00:38:51.833 --> 00:38:53.416
There's Boy Size Small.

586
00:38:56.166 --> 00:38:59.041
-Come back here! We're gonna get you!
-Yeah! Yeah!

587
00:39:00.583 --> 00:39:01.583
There he is! Come on!

588
00:39:01.666 --> 00:39:02.958
-Hey. kid!

589
00:39:03.041 --> 00:39:05.000
-Come back here!
-Come on. Wait!

590
00:39:05.083 --> 00:39:06.250
-Out of my way!
-Hey! Get off!

591
00:39:06.333 --> 00:39:07.750
Where do you think you're going?

592
00:39:11.166 --> 00:39:13.458
Hmm. what do we have here?

593
00:39:14.583 --> 00:39:16.375
-Oh!
-Uh…

594
00:39:18.791 --> 00:39:19.791
That's nasty.

595
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:23.083
-All right!

596
00:39:23.666 --> 00:39:25.333
-Hey!
-There he goes! This way!

597
00:39:25.833 --> 00:39:26.833
D'oh!

598
00:39:27.416 --> 00:39:28.750
Come here!

599
00:39:37.375 --> 00:39:39.791
I could've sworn he went this way.

600
00:39:39.875 --> 00:39:41.291
Where is he?

601
00:39:41.375 --> 00:39:43.083
He gave us the slip.

602
00:39:50.291 --> 00:39:52.916
<i>Somehow. I managed</i>
<i>to get back to Grandpa's room.</i>

603
00:39:54.250 --> 00:40:00.833
<i>But Rodrick can never find out about this.</i>
<i>'Cause if he does. I'm a dead man.</i>

604
00:40:00.916 --> 00:40:03.833
You're in big trouble. young man.

605
00:40:07.916 --> 00:40:10.250
Rodrick just rolled a 12!

606
00:40:15.208 --> 00:40:18.458
That means you've gotta fork over
half your cards.

607
00:40:19.416 --> 00:40:23.000
Come on. snake eyes!

608
00:40:25.458 --> 00:40:30.041
Put some pants on. for the love of Pete.

609
00:40:31.583 --> 00:40:34.083
Is there something you want to tell me.
little brother?

610
00:40:48.875 --> 00:40:49.875
<i>Open up!</i>

611
00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:58.125
Grandpa. can we--
Can we please change the channel?

612
00:40:58.208 --> 00:41:01.041
There's nothing but a bunch of garbage
on TV.

613
00:41:01.916 --> 00:41:03.916
I like to watch people come and go.

614
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.416
<i>Ooh! Hot in there.</i>

615
00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:06.958
Barry Grossman!

616
00:41:07.625 --> 00:41:10.375
You've got time to sit in the sauna
for two hours.

617
00:41:10.875 --> 00:41:14.958
but you can't bother yourself
to return my vacuum cleaner!

618
00:41:16.291 --> 00:41:20.208
Bah. fine! You can have the clicker.

619
00:41:21.916 --> 00:41:25.791
<i>And in some disturbing news.</i>
<i>earlier this evening.</i>

620
00:41:25.875 --> 00:41:29.500
<i>a Peeping Tom was spotted</i>
<i>in the women's bathroom at Leisure--</i>

621
00:41:38.166 --> 00:41:41.583
You're jumpy tonight.
Mind you don't wake up your brother.

622
00:41:41.666 --> 00:41:45.458
Oh. yeah. You're right. Grandpa. There's--
There's nothing good on TV.

623
00:41:45.541 --> 00:41:47.416
Ha! Told you so.

624
00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:53.416
You know. Greg. I might be old.
but I'm no fool.

625
00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:55.083
I know what's really going on.

626
00:41:56.666 --> 00:41:57.666
You do?

627
00:41:57.750 --> 00:42:01.041
You and your brother aren't here
because you want to be here.

628
00:42:01.541 --> 00:42:03.708
Your parents made you come.

629
00:42:03.791 --> 00:42:06.958
That's not true.
Grandpa. we wanted to come here.

630
00:42:09.083 --> 00:42:14.208
No boys your age would choose to spend
the weekend with an old codger like me.

631
00:42:14.291 --> 00:42:17.458
Ha! Yeah. well. I'll tell you this.

632
00:42:17.541 --> 00:42:21.583
I've enjoyed every second of it.
You're good boys.

633
00:42:24.083 --> 00:42:25.083
I guess.

634
00:42:25.166 --> 00:42:30.500
I know you boys love each other.
because you spend time together.

635
00:42:31.791 --> 00:42:36.500
It wasn't always that way with my boys.

636
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.375
And now they've grown apart.

637
00:42:39.458 --> 00:42:42.125
They don't even spend
the holidays together.

638
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.250
I just wish they'd worked things out
when they were young.

639
00:42:47.166 --> 00:42:49.000
Like you and Rodrick have.

640
00:42:49.875 --> 00:42:52.041
Maybe things would be different now.

641
00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:55.250
Yeah.

642
00:43:06.583 --> 00:43:07.625
Hey. Greg.

643
00:43:09.583 --> 00:43:12.000
Rowley. I told you not to wear stripes.

644
00:43:12.083 --> 00:43:14.666
But I thought we could be twins.

645
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:18.583
Eh. eh? See? Twins.

646
00:43:19.416 --> 00:43:21.000
Great. Now I gotta change.

647
00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:25.833
What did you do
your Life Sciences project on?

648
00:43:26.708 --> 00:43:29.750
-My what?
-Your Life Sciences project.

649
00:43:29.833 --> 00:43:31.000
It's due today.

650
00:43:31.083 --> 00:43:32.458
That's due today?

651
00:43:32.541 --> 00:43:35.791
Yeah. And it's. like. 25% of our grade.

652
00:43:35.875 --> 00:43:39.000
Oh. man! I forgot all about that project.

653
00:43:39.083 --> 00:43:43.625
What are you gonna do?
'Cause this project is 25% of our grade.

654
00:43:43.708 --> 00:43:45.583
I know. Rowley! Let me think.

655
00:43:52.166 --> 00:43:53.166
Rodrick.

656
00:43:54.291 --> 00:43:55.375
Rodrick?

657
00:43:59.166 --> 00:44:00.875
Rodrick! I need your help!

658
00:44:00.958 --> 00:44:04.000
Calm down. Gregory.
What's got your underwear in a bunch?

659
00:44:04.083 --> 00:44:06.166
I've got a Life Science project due today!

660
00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:08.958
Yeah? And what's that got to do with me?

661
00:44:09.041 --> 00:44:12.166
Well. I figured you might know some trick.
Some way out of this.

662
00:44:13.291 --> 00:44:16.333
Well. you could pretend you're sick.
Skip school.

663
00:44:16.416 --> 00:44:19.375
Mom would know I'm faking.
She always knows.

664
00:44:19.458 --> 00:44:21.291
You could tell your teacher Manny ate it.

665
00:44:21.375 --> 00:44:23.625
Really. Rodrick?
That's the best you can come up with?

666
00:44:29.208 --> 00:44:32.958
You know I still have dirt on you. right?
I can come clean to Mom right now.

667
00:44:34.833 --> 00:44:39.291
Hmm. Did you say Life Sciences?
That does ring a bell.

668
00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:42.166
Let's see.

669
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:43.875
No. No.

670
00:44:43.958 --> 00:44:46.750
-Ah!
-What are you doing?

671
00:44:47.375 --> 00:44:52.041
My life Sciences project.
And in mint condition too.

672
00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:53.750
Let me see that.

673
00:44:53.833 --> 00:44:55.208
Uh-uh-uh-uh!

674
00:44:55.291 --> 00:44:58.125
This is some of my best work.
It's why I saved it.

675
00:44:58.208 --> 00:44:59.541
Awesome. Here. give it.

676
00:44:59.625 --> 00:45:03.166
No. sir. This is gonna cost you.

677
00:45:03.250 --> 00:45:06.875
Come on. Rodrick.
Me and you have a partnership. A deal.

678
00:45:06.958 --> 00:45:11.375
Yeah. Well. our deal doesn't cover
this kind of thing. This is extra.

679
00:45:11.458 --> 00:45:13.083
Okay. what do you want for it?

680
00:45:13.166 --> 00:45:14.666
I want cash.

681
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:17.000
I don't have any cash.

682
00:45:17.083 --> 00:45:19.791
I'm talking Mom Bucks. Large bills only.

683
00:45:19.875 --> 00:45:21.791
Come on. Rodrick. Don't you have enough?

684
00:45:21.875 --> 00:45:25.625
No. you can never have enough Mom Bucks.
That's Rodrick Rule number five.

685
00:45:25.708 --> 00:45:27.833
Fine. I'll give you 20. That's fair.

686
00:45:28.833 --> 00:45:33.666
Mmm. actually.
you seem a little too eager.

687
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:34.958
Make it a hundred.

688
00:45:37.333 --> 00:45:39.833
Fine. But you can't tell anyone
about this.

689
00:45:40.583 --> 00:45:44.583
I may be a lot of things.
but one thing I am not is a snitch.

690
00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:50.750
Great doing business with you. brother.

691
00:45:56.208 --> 00:46:02.125
You got one of Rodrick's old projects?
But isn't that cheating?

692
00:46:02.208 --> 00:46:05.208
It's not cheating. It's gaming the system.

693
00:46:07.375 --> 00:46:09.375
I told you not to look at me like that.

694
00:46:09.458 --> 00:46:11.041
But what if he got a bad grade?

695
00:46:11.125 --> 00:46:14.666
My parents always help Rodrick
with his homework. So. I'm all set.

696
00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:15.958
Can I see?

697
00:46:17.666 --> 00:46:22.875
Um. Greg? I don't think
your parents helped with this one.

698
00:46:22.958 --> 00:46:24.208
Give me that!

699
00:46:24.791 --> 00:46:26.791
<i>Do plants sneeze?</i>

700
00:46:26.875 --> 00:46:29.458
<i>Hypothesis. Plants probably sneeze.</i>

701
00:46:29.541 --> 00:46:31.208
<i>Experiment. Hmm.</i>

702
00:46:31.291 --> 00:46:33.458
<i>Conclusion. Plants don't sneeze.</i>

703
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.125
Hmm.

704
00:46:39.208 --> 00:46:41.291
Rodrick!

705
00:47:10.291 --> 00:47:11.625
You lied to me!

706
00:47:11.708 --> 00:47:14.083
Whoa. whoa. whoa. Not true. bro.

707
00:47:14.166 --> 00:47:16.541
You said this was your best work!

708
00:47:17.583 --> 00:47:21.166
It was. You should've seen
my other school projects.

709
00:47:22.041 --> 00:47:23.041
Yeah.

710
00:47:23.125 --> 00:47:24.833
Well. I want my money back.

711
00:47:25.333 --> 00:47:27.750
No refunds. A deal's a deal.

712
00:47:28.916 --> 00:47:32.416
Yeah. about that.
Let's see if these change your mind.

713
00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:36.375
Yo! That's me.

714
00:47:38.666 --> 00:47:41.208
Wha-- Oh. My bad.

715
00:47:41.291 --> 00:47:43.125
Please. uh-- Please continue. bros.

716
00:47:44.333 --> 00:47:47.916
You wouldn't show these to Mom or Dad.
You're no snitch.

717
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.708
You have no idea what I'm willing to do.

718
00:47:50.791 --> 00:47:55.208
All-- All right.
Here. I'll give you your $100 back.

719
00:47:55.291 --> 00:47:59.125
Hmm. You seem a little eager.

720
00:47:59.875 --> 00:48:03.958
It's gonna cost you
approximately 200 Mom Bucks.

721
00:48:04.541 --> 00:48:06.708
Uh. "Mom Bucks"?

722
00:48:08.291 --> 00:48:12.083
Nice doing business with you.
brother.

723
00:48:13.458 --> 00:48:17.083
So. do plants sneeze?

724
00:48:19.666 --> 00:48:23.041
<i>I'm not gonna say</i>
<i>I'm proud of myself for what I did.</i>

725
00:48:23.125 --> 00:48:25.208
<i>But I learned how to negotiate</i>
<i>from the master.</i>

726
00:48:38.041 --> 00:48:41.666
Greg. you need to watch
where you're going.

727
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:45.000
Just look at this mess.

728
00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:55.583
I don't believe this.

729
00:48:55.666 --> 00:49:00.125
I-- A party? Guys? Seriously?

730
00:49:00.208 --> 00:49:03.708
Counterfeit money?
Where did you boys get all this?

731
00:49:04.416 --> 00:49:09.416
I knew that bathroom locked!
Aha! I am not going crazy.

732
00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:15.166
You boys had a party in our home.
Somebody could've gotten hurt or worse.

733
00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:16.250
See? See?

734
00:49:16.333 --> 00:49:18.958
Didn't I tell you it wasn't a good idea
for these two to be hanging out?

735
00:49:19.041 --> 00:49:24.041
Greg. it might not have been your party.
but you helped cover it up.

736
00:49:24.125 --> 00:49:26.041
You lied to us.

737
00:49:26.125 --> 00:49:27.791
And because of that. you are grounded.

738
00:49:27.875 --> 00:49:31.166
No video games or electronics
for three weeks.

739
00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:33.625
And Rodrick. you're the older brother.

740
00:49:33.708 --> 00:49:36.208
What kind of example are you setting
for Greg?

741
00:49:36.291 --> 00:49:39.333
A bad example?

742
00:49:40.416 --> 00:49:44.041
You're grounded for a month.
Hand over your van keys.

743
00:49:46.708 --> 00:49:48.791
Plus. you boys are doing the dishes
every night.

744
00:49:48.875 --> 00:49:52.458
And don't give me any of this
"my body's on a schedule" nonsense.

745
00:49:52.541 --> 00:49:53.541
Mom?

746
00:49:53.625 --> 00:49:54.625
What. Rodrick?

747
00:49:54.708 --> 00:49:57.500
So. I get that I can't use my van.
Totally fair.

748
00:49:58.041 --> 00:50:01.083
But I can still go to the talent show
if I get a ride. right?

749
00:50:01.166 --> 00:50:05.125
No. Rodrick. Grounded means grounded.
No extracurricular stuff.

750
00:50:05.208 --> 00:50:09.291
But-- But-- But-- But we--
But we've been practicing for months.

751
00:50:09.375 --> 00:50:11.583
If I can't play. the other guys
won't be able to be in the show--

752
00:50:11.666 --> 00:50:14.000
Actions have consequences.

753
00:50:14.083 --> 00:50:18.083
What kind of parents would we be
if we let you go to the talent show?

754
00:50:19.125 --> 00:50:20.791
Good parents?

755
00:50:23.791 --> 00:50:25.708
-Mom?
-Yes. Greg?

756
00:50:26.208 --> 00:50:29.750
Since Rodrick can't be in the talent show.
I can't either. right?

757
00:50:29.833 --> 00:50:31.500
Because that wouldn't be fair.

758
00:50:31.583 --> 00:50:35.916
You are not using this as an excuse
to get out of that talent show. Greg!

759
00:50:36.458 --> 00:50:40.125
You can't let Rowley down.
He's done so much for you.

760
00:50:40.208 --> 00:50:43.041
Now go.
Go help your brother with the dishes.

761
00:51:01.708 --> 00:51:04.375
So. that was pretty crazy back there. huh?

762
00:51:05.333 --> 00:51:08.375
I mean. three weeks of no electronics.
I expected.

763
00:51:08.458 --> 00:51:10.958
But your punishment was a little harsh
if you ask me.

764
00:51:11.041 --> 00:51:14.208
It wouldn't have happened
if you didn't snitch.

765
00:51:14.291 --> 00:51:16.708
Hey. whoa! I didn't say anything!

766
00:51:16.791 --> 00:51:20.000
You marched right upstairs
and went straight to Mommy and Daddy.

767
00:51:20.083 --> 00:51:21.791
You ratted me out!

768
00:51:21.875 --> 00:51:25.458
No snitching.
That's Rodrick Rule number one!

769
00:51:25.541 --> 00:51:29.041
I thought rule number one was
no apostrophes.

770
00:51:29.875 --> 00:51:31.750
And besides. that's not what happened!

771
00:51:31.833 --> 00:51:35.750
I took you under my wing! I trusted you!

772
00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:42.833
Yeah. it's been great.
You've taught me a lot.

773
00:51:43.875 --> 00:51:47.750
Yeah. and the only reason that I did
was because you had dirt on me.

774
00:51:47.833 --> 00:51:50.750
And now you don't. So. watch your back.

775
00:51:51.916 --> 00:51:53.291
But--

776
00:51:53.375 --> 00:51:56.750
I thought you were cool.
Guess I was wrong.

777
00:52:06.958 --> 00:52:11.500
Introducing the Amazing Rowley Jefferson!

778
00:52:12.541 --> 00:52:14.541
Whoo. yeah!

779
00:52:15.291 --> 00:52:21.375
And with a wave of my magic wand.
the egg has disappeared!

780
00:52:23.791 --> 00:52:28.208
Greg. you were supposed to turn the cup
upside down before you gave it back to me.

781
00:52:29.625 --> 00:52:32.041
Huh? Oh. yeah. Next time.

782
00:52:32.125 --> 00:52:36.583
If we don't get this right
by Friday night. we're never gonna win!

783
00:52:36.666 --> 00:52:40.375
We're not gonna win. Rowley.
We're competing against high schoolers.

784
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.083
Well. at least we don't have to go
against your brother's band.

785
00:52:45.583 --> 00:52:49.166
Yes. we do.
They got a replacement drummer.

786
00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:50.625
Oh.

787
00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:53.041
Hey. I've got an idea.

788
00:52:53.625 --> 00:52:55.875
I was thinking
maybe I could be the magician

789
00:52:55.958 --> 00:52:58.291
and you could be the assistant.

790
00:52:58.375 --> 00:53:00.250
It's way more believable that way.

791
00:53:00.333 --> 00:53:04.250
But it's my magic set!
I got it for my birthday!

792
00:53:05.416 --> 00:53:07.291
Okay. okay.

793
00:53:07.375 --> 00:53:08.500
-Gee whiz.

794
00:53:08.583 --> 00:53:10.375
Hey. guys!

795
00:53:10.458 --> 00:53:13.708
Hi. Rodrick. Wanna see some magic?

796
00:53:13.791 --> 00:53:17.083
Nah. wouldn't want you to spoil it for me.
Save it for the big night.

797
00:53:17.166 --> 00:53:19.125
Oh. Okay!

798
00:53:19.208 --> 00:53:21.083
Wait. What are you doing up here?

799
00:53:21.166 --> 00:53:25.416
I found something on the kitchen table.
Thought it might belong to you.

800
00:53:26.583 --> 00:53:28.291
Hey! Give it back!

801
00:53:28.375 --> 00:53:33.291
Easy there. little brother.
I was just returning your property.

802
00:53:34.416 --> 00:53:37.291
Wait. You didn't read it. did you?

803
00:53:37.375 --> 00:53:40.666
Read it?
Way too many words for me.

804
00:53:43.458 --> 00:53:46.625
I did look at the pictures though.

805
00:53:46.708 --> 00:53:48.708
And boy. I learned a lot.

806
00:53:48.791 --> 00:53:53.250
Like what really happened
at Leisure Towers.

807
00:53:54.791 --> 00:53:55.791
That's private.

808
00:53:55.875 --> 00:53:58.500
Well. it's about to be public.

809
00:53:58.583 --> 00:54:00.250
See. I know people.

810
00:54:00.333 --> 00:54:03.916
And those people have little brothers
and sisters that go to your school.

811
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:07.125
And I'll bet they're gonna love
reading about your little adventure

812
00:54:07.208 --> 00:54:08.208
in the women's bathroom.

813
00:54:08.291 --> 00:54:09.625
You wouldn't!

814
00:54:09.708 --> 00:54:13.500
You ratted me out.
These are the consequences.

815
00:54:15.583 --> 00:54:16.583
Give me that!

816
00:54:22.583 --> 00:54:23.750
Oh!

817
00:54:23.833 --> 00:54:25.250
-Ow!

818
00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:28.666
No!

819
00:54:29.791 --> 00:54:30.958
Ooh!

820
00:54:33.541 --> 00:54:34.666
Nice catch.

821
00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:37.583
-Oops!

822
00:54:41.125 --> 00:54:42.875
No!

823
00:54:44.958 --> 00:54:45.958
My bad.

824
00:54:47.333 --> 00:54:50.541
<i>Believe me. I did not</i>
<i>want to go to school the next day.</i>

825
00:54:50.625 --> 00:54:55.041
<i>After Rodrick's little text was sent out.</i>
<i>my reputation was gonna be ruined.</i>

826
00:54:56.375 --> 00:54:58.166
<i>But I knew I couldn't hide forever.</i>

827
00:54:58.250 --> 00:55:01.916
<i>So. I just decided to bite the bullet</i>
<i>and get it over with.</i>

828
00:55:08.125 --> 00:55:10.750
All right. Rowley. Let's do this.

829
00:55:11.291 --> 00:55:12.291
Rowley?

830
00:55:13.583 --> 00:55:15.625
You got this. Greg!

831
00:55:19.666 --> 00:55:22.041
-This week's flying by. like. so fast.
-I know!

832
00:55:22.125 --> 00:55:24.041
-Wait. Wait. Is that Greg Heffley?
-Look!

833
00:55:24.583 --> 00:55:25.833
Whoa!

834
00:55:28.708 --> 00:55:29.791
What?

835
00:55:31.958 --> 00:55:35.916
Greg! Greg! Greg! Greg!
Greg! Greg! Greg! Greg! Greg! Greg!

836
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.958
<i>It took me a few minutes</i>
<i>to figure out what was going on.</i>

837
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.583
<i>Rodrick's message went out</i>
<i>to all of his friends.</i>

838
00:55:44.250 --> 00:55:47.083
<i>His friends told their brothers</i>
<i>and sisters what happened to me.</i>

839
00:55:47.166 --> 00:55:48.458
<i>and they told their friends.</i>

840
00:55:48.541 --> 00:55:49.541
<i>Just like Rodrick planned it.</i>

841
00:55:49.625 --> 00:55:51.583
<i>But I guess people mixed up the facts</i>

842
00:55:51.666 --> 00:55:55.541
<i>because by the time I got to school.</i>
<i>the story was totally scrambled.</i>

843
00:55:58.250 --> 00:55:59.500
<i>Somehow the story went</i>

844
00:55:59.583 --> 00:56:02.791
<i>from me being caught</i>
<i>in the ladies' room at Leisure Towers.</i>

845
00:56:02.875 --> 00:56:07.166
<i>to me sneaking into a bingo game</i>
<i>and walking off with the grand prize.</i>

846
00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:09.750
Bingo!

847
00:56:10.916 --> 00:56:14.458
<i>And the only thing people got right was</i>
<i>me getting chased by the security guards.</i>

848
00:56:14.541 --> 00:56:16.916
<i>But even that stuff got exaggerated.</i>

849
00:56:18.833 --> 00:56:19.958
-Hey!

850
00:56:20.041 --> 00:56:21.041
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

851
00:56:27.416 --> 00:56:29.375
<i>Even the thing</i>
<i>with the vending machines</i>

852
00:56:29.458 --> 00:56:30.541
<i>made it into the story.</i>

853
00:56:30.625 --> 00:56:32.291
<i>but the facts got mixed up there too.</i>

854
00:56:33.833 --> 00:56:36.833
<i>I wasn't exactly in a hurry</i>
<i>to set the record straight. though.</i>

855
00:56:36.916 --> 00:56:40.250
<i>Because the new version of the story</i>
<i>made me look pretty sick.</i>

856
00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:46.666
<i>So Rodrick's plan backfired.</i>

857
00:56:46.750 --> 00:56:49.000
<i>and I got a taste of what it's like</i>
<i>to be popular for once.</i>

858
00:56:49.083 --> 00:56:51.541
Wow! This is so cool! I got his autograph!

859
00:56:52.375 --> 00:56:54.125
<i>But I knew it wouldn't last.</i>

860
00:56:54.791 --> 00:56:58.208
<i>Because the second I took the stage</i>
<i>as Rowley's assistant at the talent show.</i>

861
00:56:58.291 --> 00:57:00.250
<i>my reputation was gonna take a nosedive.</i>

862
00:57:00.333 --> 00:57:03.875
I don't get
why I have to go to this thing.

863
00:57:03.958 --> 00:57:08.500
You're here to cheer on your brother.
Rodrick. and your bandmates.

864
00:57:08.583 --> 00:57:10.166
Ex-bandmates.

865
00:57:10.875 --> 00:57:14.916
D-Does the rec center have
a bathroom?

866
00:57:27.958 --> 00:57:31.208
Okay. Everyone. hop out.
I'll go look for a spot.

867
00:57:40.166 --> 00:57:42.500
Yo! What's shaking. little man?

868
00:57:42.583 --> 00:57:43.791
Uh. nothing much.

869
00:57:43.875 --> 00:57:47.541
So. we heard about your little dustup
over at Leisure Towers.

870
00:57:47.625 --> 00:57:48.625
The what?

871
00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:50.375
Oh. yeah. That.

872
00:57:50.458 --> 00:57:53.041
Dude. you're a legend!

873
00:57:53.125 --> 00:57:55.500
An absolute lege. dude!

874
00:57:55.583 --> 00:57:56.875
Yeah. I guess.

875
00:57:56.958 --> 00:57:58.625
So. we were thinking.

876
00:57:59.333 --> 00:58:03.666
if we join forces tonight.
we could win this thing.

877
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:05.458
Huh? I-I don't get it.

878
00:58:05.541 --> 00:58:08.750
You've got the middle school vote.
And we've got the high school vote.

879
00:58:08.833 --> 00:58:11.208
And I've got the Mom vote. Not to brag.

880
00:58:11.291 --> 00:58:13.125
What do you mean "join forces"?

881
00:58:13.208 --> 00:58:18.250
How'd you like to be
Löded Diper's new drummer?

882
00:58:18.791 --> 00:58:20.833
What? I don't know how to play the drums.

883
00:58:20.916 --> 00:58:22.875
We know your brother's been teaching you.

884
00:58:22.958 --> 00:58:26.583
Time for the student to become the master.

885
00:58:26.666 --> 00:58:31.291
Sorry. guys. I'm in my friend's magic act.
I can't get out of it.

886
00:58:31.375 --> 00:58:37.708
That's where Larry comes in.
We'll do a clean swap. You for him.

887
00:58:37.791 --> 00:58:39.791
Magic is my real passion.

888
00:58:40.333 --> 00:58:41.666
Ta-da!

889
00:58:42.166 --> 00:58:46.166
I just can't do that to Rodrick.
He's my brother.

890
00:58:47.250 --> 00:58:48.833
Why don't you just think it over?

891
00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:52.416
Maybe this is your turn to shine. my dude.

892
00:59:04.083 --> 00:59:05.541
I'll think about it.

893
00:59:06.041 --> 00:59:08.750
That's all we're asking. little man.

894
00:59:34.333 --> 00:59:36.416
-Yo! It's Greg!
-That's Greg Heffley!

895
00:59:37.041 --> 00:59:39.875
-You're a legend. dude.
-Yeah. thanks.

896
00:59:41.166 --> 00:59:42.458
Oh!

897
00:59:42.541 --> 00:59:44.916
Is that Boy Size Small?

898
00:59:47.958 --> 00:59:49.000
Where were you?

899
00:59:49.083 --> 00:59:50.500
I just got held up.

900
01:00:01.625 --> 01:00:04.666
Oh. this is so exciting.

901
01:00:06.166 --> 01:00:09.750
<i>Ladies and gentlemen. boys and girls!</i>

902
01:00:09.833 --> 01:00:14.458
-<i>Welcome to the Talent Show!</i>

903
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.750
Then the man in the orthopedic shoes said.
"I stand corrected!"

904
01:00:53.291 --> 01:00:54.291
Oh.

905
01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:12.458
I've got to get ready.

906
01:01:12.541 --> 01:01:14.500
-Break a leg. Greg.
-Okay.

907
01:01:14.583 --> 01:01:17.625
Do your best for Rowley.
Try and look like you're having fun.

908
01:01:17.708 --> 01:01:18.708
Hey. Greg.

909
01:01:19.625 --> 01:01:24.125
Can't wait to see you do your magic.
So uncool.

910
01:01:30.208 --> 01:01:32.541
Are you ready for some magic. Manny?

911
01:01:32.625 --> 01:01:35.208
-Yay!
-Yes. you are. Yes. you are.

912
01:01:35.291 --> 01:01:38.291
Ladies and gentlemen.
boys and girls.

913
01:01:38.791 --> 01:01:41.833
We have just one question for you.

914
01:01:41.916 --> 01:01:43.583
-Wake up!

915
01:01:43.666 --> 01:01:48.250
Are you ready to rock?

916
01:01:49.416 --> 01:01:51.083
Yeah!

917
01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:57.000
Now. before we explode your eardrums
with a blast of pure rock and roll.

918
01:01:58.041 --> 01:02:03.000
it's time to introduce
the newest member of Löded Diper.

919
01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:09.666
Please join me in welcoming
Greg Heffley to the stage!

920
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:10.708
-Greg?

921
01:02:20.125 --> 01:02:22.916
Come on. little dude. Give 'em a taste.

922
01:02:25.791 --> 01:02:27.833
Oh. Oof.

923
01:02:44.416 --> 01:02:46.541
Yeah. right on.

924
01:02:46.625 --> 01:02:48.375
We love you. Greg!

925
01:02:48.458 --> 01:02:54.125
Greg! Greg! Greg! Greg!
Greg! Greg! Greg! Greg! Greg! Greg!

926
01:03:15.541 --> 01:03:18.375
Yo. you ready
to blow the roof off this place?

927
01:03:38.333 --> 01:03:40.375
Hey. You're missing the show.

928
01:03:40.958 --> 01:03:45.083
What are you doing out here?
Aren't you supposed to be on stage?

929
01:03:45.166 --> 01:03:47.333
I don't know. It didn't feel right.

930
01:03:47.416 --> 01:03:50.291
Well. maybe that's because it's not right.

931
01:03:50.833 --> 01:03:55.250
You stole my spot just to get back at me
for the diary thing.

932
01:03:55.333 --> 01:03:59.458
Pretty much.
But it wasn't just about payback.

933
01:03:59.541 --> 01:04:01.500
Yeah. right.

934
01:04:02.208 --> 01:04:05.208
I. uh. wanted you to be proud of me.

935
01:04:05.291 --> 01:04:07.916
Proud of you? For what?

936
01:04:08.541 --> 01:04:11.291
I-I know. I-It was dumb.

937
01:04:13.166 --> 01:04:16.000
I've got something that I've got to
get off my chest too. I guess.

938
01:04:16.083 --> 01:04:20.291
I-- I shouldn't have taken your diary.

939
01:04:21.125 --> 01:04:24.125
That wasn't… cool.

940
01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:30.333
I don't understand why we can't
just get along like normal brothers.

941
01:04:30.833 --> 01:04:33.708
This is normal. Brothers fight.

942
01:04:34.208 --> 01:04:37.375
We just… took it too far.

943
01:04:37.875 --> 01:04:42.500
But do you think we're gonna be all right.
like. in the long run?

944
01:04:42.583 --> 01:04:45.375
What? What do you mean?

945
01:04:45.458 --> 01:04:49.583
Well. Dad and his brothers don't even
see each other on holidays anymore.

946
01:04:49.666 --> 01:04:51.875
Is that gonna happen to us?

947
01:04:57.416 --> 01:05:01.500
Heck. yeah. we're gonna see each other
on the holidays. We're family.

948
01:05:04.916 --> 01:05:07.625
But I am not hosting. Too much work.

949
01:05:07.708 --> 01:05:09.750
Okay. Deal.

950
01:05:09.833 --> 01:05:12.750
Listen. me and you
are gonna have our battles.

951
01:05:13.333 --> 01:05:15.875
But I really hope you know
that when the chips are down.

952
01:05:15.958 --> 01:05:18.666
and I mean really down.

953
01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:22.041
I'm gonna have your back.
And you better have mine.

954
01:05:22.125 --> 01:05:24.875
Because it's the Heffley brothers
against the world.

955
01:05:26.458 --> 01:05:27.625
The Heffley brothers.

956
01:05:29.833 --> 01:05:32.875
Greg! Greg! Greg!

957
01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:37.041
So? Are you gonna keep sitting out here.
or are you gonna go make me proud?

958
01:05:37.625 --> 01:05:41.541
Yeah. about that.
These don't belong to me.

959
01:05:47.083 --> 01:05:50.416
Like you said. there's only one Rodrick.
And that's you.

960
01:05:55.375 --> 01:05:57.291
Wait a second.
I'm still grounded.

961
01:05:57.375 --> 01:05:59.416
Oh. yeah. I forgot about that.

962
01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:04.291
Oh. well. Rodrick Rule number
ten. Always go out in a blaze of glory.

963
01:06:06.583 --> 01:06:08.500
-Come on. entertain us!

964
01:06:08.583 --> 01:06:13.000
Stand by. Uh. we're just having some.
uh. technical difficulties.

965
01:06:14.625 --> 01:06:16.708
All right!

966
01:06:16.791 --> 01:06:22.541
Please welcome
Löded Diper's original drummer.

967
01:06:22.625 --> 01:06:24.583
Rodrick Heffley!

968
01:06:24.666 --> 01:06:26.833
-Whoo!

969
01:06:26.916 --> 01:06:28.166
-What?
-Rodrick?

970
01:06:38.083 --> 01:06:40.041
Rodrick rules!

971
01:06:40.125 --> 01:06:42.250
We love you. Rodrick!

972
01:06:43.125 --> 01:06:44.583
Unbelievable.

973
01:06:47.791 --> 01:06:51.750
Greg. you do understand
that you're both grounded?

974
01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:53.291
Yeah. I know.

975
01:06:53.375 --> 01:06:55.583
Rodrick isn't supposed to be up there.

976
01:06:56.333 --> 01:06:59.583
So. we have no choice
but to extend your punishment.

977
01:07:01.791 --> 01:07:02.791
It's worth it.

978
01:07:02.875 --> 01:07:05.416
He's my brother. I've got his back.

979
01:07:09.583 --> 01:07:12.583
You're raising some good boys there. Son.

980
01:07:13.708 --> 01:07:14.708
Yeah.

981
01:07:34.833 --> 01:07:36.708
-Yippee!

982
01:07:36.791 --> 01:07:38.666
-Whoo!
-Whoo-hoo!

983
01:07:50.208 --> 01:07:51.208
Come on!

984
01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.458
Huh?

985
01:08:04.291 --> 01:08:06.791
-Yeah! Löded Diper!
-Uh-huh! Yeah!

986
01:08:10.708 --> 01:08:12.541
Whoo! That's my jam!

987
01:08:31.833 --> 01:08:33.500
What? Susan!

988
01:08:33.583 --> 01:08:34.916
Yeah!

989
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.083
Whoo-hoo!

990
01:08:41.458 --> 01:08:42.458
Susan. your bunions!

991
01:08:42.541 --> 01:08:43.833
Whoo!

992
01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.208
-Oh. man!
-Look at her!

993
01:08:53.708 --> 01:08:56.416
-Oh! See. I can't unsee that!

994
01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:57.500
That's right.

995
01:08:58.041 --> 01:09:00.250
-Whoo-hoo!
-Oh. Whoo!

996
01:09:02.958 --> 01:09:06.750
<i>Even after all that.</i>
<i>Löded Diper didn't win the talent show.</i>

997
01:09:06.833 --> 01:09:09.333
<i>First place went to</i>
<i>the Amazing Rowley Jefferson</i>

998
01:09:09.416 --> 01:09:11.958
<i>and his assistant Larry the Wonderful.</i>

999
01:09:13.291 --> 01:09:15.875
<i>But it wasn't all bad news</i>
<i>for Rodrick and his band.</i>

1000
01:09:15.958 --> 01:09:18.958
<i>Thanks to Mom.</i>
<i>their music reached a whole new audience.</i>

1001
01:09:29.458 --> 01:09:32.333
<i>I'm really not too worried</i>
<i>about me and Rodrick growing apart.</i>

1002
01:09:32.833 --> 01:09:35.625
<i>Sure. we'll have our ups and downs.</i>
<i>but for now…</i>

1003
01:09:37.208 --> 01:09:38.208
<i>…we're cool.</i>
