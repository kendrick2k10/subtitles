so that you know what to expect.

308
00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:36.218

in obstetrics and gynecology

309
00:19:36.218 --> 00:19:38.470
with an emphasis on the cognitive side

310
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:40.138

311
00:19:40.138 --> 00:19:42.641
I have seen too many women

313

because they don't want to have children.

314

But after hearing their stories

315
00:19:49.731 --> 00:19:51.149
and knowing their medical history.

316
00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:53.861
I have become 100 percent convinced

317
00:19:54.236 --> 00:19:57.823
that this is
a fixable physiological issue.

318
00:19:59.157 --> 00:20:00.909
The idea is simple.

319
00:20:01.869 --> 00:20:06.707
It is the singular evolutionary goal
of a species to procreate.

320
00:20:07.332 --> 00:20:09.668
That is our purpose. right?

321
00:20:10.836 --> 00:20:12.838
- Right.
- Which says to me that

322
00:20:12.838 --> 00:20:15.549
because you are otherwise
physically healthy.

323
00:20:15.549 --> 00:20:19.636
your system is just a little off.
chemically. mentally.

324
00:20:20.637 --> 00:20:23.432
No different than someone
with depression. You follow?

325
00:20:24.516 --> 00:20:27.769
- Sure.
- So the whole goal of this trial

326
00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:31.106
is to get you back realigned
with your natural state.

327
00:20:31.607 --> 00:20:32.983
And what does that involve?

328
00:20:33.525 --> 00:20:35.152
A multi-pronged approach.

329
00:20:35.694 --> 00:20:37.070
We administer medication.

330
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:39.573

331
00:20:39.573 --> 00:20:42.284
- Synthetic?
- A regimen of pills.

332
00:20:42.284 --> 00:20:45.954
The same naturally occurring hormones
that already exist in your body.

333
00:20:45.954 --> 00:20:48.540
just formulated
to up your desire for kids.

334
00:20:49.041 --> 00:20:52.419
And we pair that course
of treatment with CBT.

00:20:52.419 --> 00:20:54.421

338
00:20:57.716 --> 00:21:00.385

339
00:21:00.385 --> 00:21:02.179
Intense. but effective.

340
00:21:02.971 --> 00:21:05.516

893
01:00:04.104 --> 01:00:07.232
She was so excited
about becoming a mother.

894
01:00:07.232 --> 01:00:08.775
Which reminds me.
I have to call your mother back.

895
01:00:08.775 --> 01:00:11.278
because she promised to bring me over
the whatchamacallit stuff

896
01:00:11.278 --> 01:00:12.529

Oh. my God.

905
01:00:32.257 --> 01:00:35.344
I have been looking
for this photograph for years.

906
01:00:39.556 --> 01:00:40.766
Who is that?

907
01:00:40.766 --> 01:00:42.726
What? Well. you--
Well. you know who this is.

908
01:00:42.726 --> 01:00:44.853
- No. I don't.
- Yeah. this is your grandmother.

909
01:00:44.853 --> 01:00:47.606
This is the first picture
that she had taken in America.

910
01:00:47.606 --> 01:00:48.524
Well. it's understandable.

911
01:00:48.524 --> 01:00:49.816
I mean. you don't recognize her

912
01:00:49.816 --> 01:00:51.443
because she's only 80 pounds here.

913
01:00:51.443 --> 01:00:52.736
She just came out of the camps.

914
01:00:56.532 --> 01:00:58.992

She's horrifying.

915
01:00:58.992 --> 01:01:00.577

916
01:01:01.245 --> 01:01:04.414
That woman lived a horror story.

917
01:01:04.414 --> 01:01:06.542
Yeah. well. I never wanna hear
her story again.

918
01:01:06.542 --> 01:01:08.502
Well. you can close your ears
and you can close your eyes.

919
01:01:08.502 --> 01:01:09.878
but you can't outrun her.

920

through the matriarchs.

921
01:01:13.215 --> 01:01:15.175
Her story is in you.

922
01:01:15.175 --> 01:01:17.052
- It's your legacy.
- Quite the inheritance.

923
01:01:18.637 --> 01:01:19.930
What?

924
01:01:19.930 --> 01:01:21.765
Let me tell you something. Ella.

925
01:01:21.765 --> 01:01:24.017
When somebody receives an inheritance.

926
01:01:24.685 --> 01:01:28.105
they can either graciously accept
what's been given to them.

927
01:01:29.106 --> 01:01:30.357
or they can piss it away.

928

They can just piss it away.

929
01:01:35.404 --> 01:01:36.405
Don't do that.

930
01:01:36.405 --> 01:01:38.866
- And you. my ungrateful child...
- Don't do that. Don't do that.

931
01:01:38.866 --> 01:01:41.785
- ...you've chosen to just piss it away.
- Dad. stop. Just stop.

- No.

934
01:01:44.121 --> 01:01:45.914
- Not that one. Not that one.
- Piss us--

935
01:01:45.914 --> 01:01:47.958
