512
00:20:34.079 --> 00:20:36.259
DIFFERENT.

513
00:20:36.259 --> 00:20:41.240
I GOT REALLY INSPIRED BY READING

514
00:20:36.259 --> 00:20:41.240

IT'S VERY MEANINGFUL.

522
00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:56.240
WE ARE LIVING IN A TIME WHERE

523
00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:01.099
PEOPLE DON'T FEEL SEEN AND FEEL

524
00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:01.099
INVISIBLE.

525
00:21:01.099 --> 00:21:04.170

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:13.139
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU AND

1131
00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:13.139
WHAT IS SOME OF THE FEEDBACK

1132
00:42:13.139 --> 00:42:17.019
THAT MAYBE HAS STAYED WITH YOU?

1133
00:42:13.139 --> 00:42:17.019
>> IT'S JUST HONESTLY IT'S ALL

1134
00:42:17.019 --> 00:42:19.110
BEEN INCREDIBLE.

1135
00:42:17.019 --> 00:42:19.110
AND I JUST NEVER EXPECTED --

1136
00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:24.039
NONE OF US EXPECTED -- WE MADE

1137
00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:24.039
THIS MOVIE IN 23 DAYS.

1138
00:42:24.039 --> 00:42:26.269
WE NEVER EXPECTED IT TO GET TO

1139
00:42:24.039 --> 00:42:26.269
THE STAGE.

1140
00:42:26.269 --> 00:42:30.170
I THINK WHAT'S BEEN SO MOVING IS

1141
00:42:26.269 --> 00:42:30.170
PEOPLE'S CANDOR AND THE

1142
00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:32.139
CONVERSATIONS IT'S OPENED UP FOR

1143
00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:32.139
LOTS OF PEOPLE.

1144
00:42:32.139 --> 00:42:35.190
IT'S JUST ALL BEEN REALLY

1145
00:42:32.139 --> 00:42:35.190
OVERWHELMING BUT IN A VERY

1146
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:42.230
POSITIVE WAY.

1147
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:42.230
>> AND YOUR STAR IN THE FILM IS

1148
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:51.230
CAREY MULLIGAN.

1149
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:51.230
WE KNOW CAREY IS A BRILLIANT AK

1150
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:54.260
STRESS.

1151
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:54.260
>> SHE'S SO GOOD BUT SHE'S ALSO

1152
00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:56.190
INCREDIBLY FUNNY.

1153
00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:56.190
THAT'S THE THING.

1154
00:42:56.190 --> 00:43:04.110
I THINK DRAMATIC ACTORS RARELY

1155
00:42:56.190 --> 00:43:04.110
GET TO BE FUNNY AND SHE IS

1156
00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:06.110
DYNAMITE AT COMEDY.

1157
00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:06.110
>> A LOT OF WRITERS HAVE THEIR

1158
00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:10.019
GO-TO THING THEY GO TO TO GET IN

1159
00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:10.019

1160
00:43:10.019 --> 00:43:14.039

1161
00:43:10.019 --> 00:43:14.039
DAY THEY WRITE.

1162
00:43:14.039 --> 00:43:18.289
WHAT IS YOURS SF?

WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL. AND I

00:46:55.019 --> 00:46:58.039
SHARED A ROOM WITH A GRANDMOTHER

1287
00:46:55.019 --> 00:46:58.039
FOR A FEW YEARS WHO CAME OVER TO

1288
00:46:58.039 --> 00:47:00.219
THE STATES FROM ITALY.

1289
00:46:58.039 --> 00:47:00.219

1297
00:47:11.119 --> 00:47:16.079
ME. AND IT MAKES ME VERY PROUD

1298
00:47:16.079 --> 00:47:20.210
OF BEING INVOLVED IN THIS FILM.

1299
00:47:16.079 --> 00:47:20.210
IT MIRRORS MY OWN CHILDHOOD WITH

1300
00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:25.179
MY GRANDMA LIVING WITH US AND

1301
00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:25.179
SPENDING EIGHT LOT

1302
00:47:25.179 --> 00:47:28.000
SPENDING A LOT OF TIME WITH HER.

1303
00:47:25.179 --> 00:47:28.000
IT'S THE REASON WE TELL THESE

1304
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.039

A MOVIE BECAUSE IT'S SO MOVING

1307
00:47:30.039 --> 00:47:34.190
AND ISAAC'S SCRIPT WAS SO

1308
00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:36.110
MEANINGFUL.

1309
00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:36.110

1312
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:42.090
HUMBLING EXPERIENCE.

00:52:16.210 --> 00:52:20.150

SO THAT YOU KIND OF CAN BRING

1502
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:23.110
THIS WORLD INTO EVERYDAY LIFE.

1503
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:23.110
THAT'S WHAT I WILL DO.

1504
00:52:23.110 --> 00:52:27.079
>> I WAS GOING TO SAY. CAN WE

1505
00:52:23.110 --> 00:52:27.079

1506
00:52:27.079 --> 00:52:29.090
CAN WE MAKE IT REALITY.

1507
00:52:27.079 --> 00:52:29.090

BEAUTIFUL THING AND WOULD BE SO

1510
00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:35.090
APPRECIATED BY SO MANY PEOPLE.

1511
00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:35.090
BEFORE I LET YOU GO. I HAVE TO

1512
00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:37.090
ASK FOR A MOMENT.

1513
00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:37.090
YOUR INSTAGRAM.

1514
00:52:37.090 --> 00:52:39.139
YOU HAVE FUN ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

1515
00:52:37.090 --> 00:52:39.139
YOU DO.

1516
00:52:39.139 --> 00:52:41.159
YOU DO.

1517
00:52:39.139 --> 00:52:41.159
WHAT DO YOU FIND SO ENTERTAINING

1518
00:52:41.159 --> 00:52:45.039
ABOUT IT?

1519
00:52:41.159 --> 00:52:45.039
>> WELL. I DON'T KNOW.

1520
00:52:45.039 --> 00:52:50.070
SOMETIMES I DON'T DO IT FOR A

1521
00:52:45.039 --> 00:52:50.070
WHILE BECAUSE IT'S NOT KIND OF

1522
00:52:50.070 --> 00:52:53.119
NATURAL TO ME.

1523
00:52:50.070 --> 00:52:53.119
IF I THINK I CAN DO SOMETHING

1524
00:52:53.119 --> 00:52:55.250
THAT OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT BE

1525
00:52:53.119 --> 00:52:55.250
INTERESTED IN OR I CAN CRACK

1526
00:52:55.250 --> 00:52:59.079
MYSELF UP OR IT'S A BEAUTIFUL

1527
00:52:55.250 --> 00:52:59.079
SUNSET OR SOME BEAUTIFUL -- YOU

1528
00:52:59.079 --> 00:53:00.019

00:52:59.079 --> 00:53:00.019
>> YEAH.

00:53:00.019 --> 00:53:03.190
WHATEVER KIND OF COMES INTO MY

1532
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:04.239
HEAD.

1533
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:04.239
SOMETIMES IT WORKS.

1534
00:53:04.239 --> 00:53:07.099
SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T.

1535
00:53:04.239 --> 00:53:07.099
BUT I DECIDED THAT IF I WAS

1536
00:53:07.099 --> 00:53:10.210
GOING TO DO IT. IT HAS TO JUST

1537
00:53:07.099 --> 00:53:10.210
BASICALLY BE ME.

1538
00:53:10.210 --> 00:53:13.050
SO. FOR BETTER OR WORSE. THAT'S

1539
00:53:10.210 --> 00:53:13.050
WHAT YOU GET.

00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:15.179

HOW DO YOU CHOOSE A ROLE?

1546
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:24.119
I IMAGINE SO MUCH MATERIAL COMES

1547
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:24.119
YOUR WAY.

1548
00:53:24.119 --> 00:53:27.110
WHAT IS IT ABOUT A ROLE THAT HAS

1549
00:53:24.119 --> 00:53:27.110

00:53:27.110 --> 00:53:30.090

I ALSO DON'T WANT TO GO OVER

1560
00:53:45.119 --> 00:53:49.190
TERRITORY I'VE BEEN OVER BEFORE.

1561
00:53:45.119 --> 00:53:49.190
KIND OF PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND

1562
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:51.130

HAVE EMBRACED IT AND TO SEE IT'S

1640
00:56:40.179 --> 00:56:44.099

HOW IS THAT SPECIAL TO YOU?

1642
00:56:44.099 --> 00:56:48.260
>> EVERYONE ALL OVER THE WORLD

KNOWS ABOUT OSCARS.

1644
00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:51.130
AND THEY ARE FAMOUS AWARDS AND

1645
00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:51.130
CEREMONY.

1646
00:56:51.130 --> 00:56:54.230
>> YES.

1647
00:56:51.130 --> 00:56:54.230
>> SO. AS A KOREAN. AS AN ASIAN

1648
00:56:54.230 --> 00:57:00.199
WOMAN. I THINK IN KOREA I'M THE

1649
00:56:54.230 --> 00:57:00.199
FIRST NOMINEE FOR THE OSCARS.

1650
00:57:00.199 --> 00:57:03.059
SO. IT'S A VERY HISTORICAL

1651
00:57:00.199 --> 00:57:03.059
MOMENT FOR US.

1652
00:57:03.059 --> 00:57:08.110
SO. OF COURSE WE ARE VERY

1653
00:57:03.059 --> 00:57:08.110
EXCITED AND VERY STRANGE TO ME

1654
00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:11.239
ACTUALLY.

1655
00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:11.239
>> IT'S VERY STRANGE TO YOU.

1656
00:57:11.239 --> 00:57:13.269
ACTUALLY.

1657
00:57:11.239 --> 00:57:13.269
>> DO YOU AGREE?

1658
00:57:13.269 --> 00:57:17.250
>> YEAH. YEAH. AGREE.

1659
00:57:13.269 --> 00:57:17.250
>> HOW WAS IT SHOOTING THIS

1660
00:57:17.250 --> 00:57:20.010
FILM?

1661
00:57:17.250 --> 00:57:20.010
I KNOW IT WAS A SHORT AMOUNT OF

1662
00:57:20.010 --> 00:57:22.280
TIME. ONLY 25 DAYS.

1663
00:57:20.010 --> 00:57:22.280
WHAT WAS THAT EXPERIENCE LIKE?

1664
00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:27.219
>> SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. SHORT

1665
00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:27.219
AMOUNT OF MONEY.

1666
00:57:27.219 --> 00:57:32.289
SO. WE WENT ALMOST TOGETHER.

1667
00:57:27.219 --> 00:57:32.289
WE RENTED AIRBNB AND WE LIVED

1668
00:57:32.289 --> 00:57:34.280
TOGETHER.

1669
00:57:32.289 --> 00:57:34.280
SHE WAS PLAYING MY DAUGHTER. AND

00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:40.110
THERE'S SOME -- OUR FRIEND THERE

WAS TRANSLATOR.

1672
00:57:40.110 --> 00:57:43.050
SO. WE MADE A FAMILY TOGETHER. I

1673
00:57:40.110 --> 00:57:43.050
THINK.

1674
00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:44.210
THAT'S WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT THIS

1675
00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:44.210
MOVIE.

1676
00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:48.119
WE BECAME A REAL FAMILY.

1677
00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:48.119
>> YOU BECAME A REAL FAMILY.

1678
00:57:48.119 --> 00:57:52.170
AND YOUR CHARACTER. PLAYING THE

1679
00:57:48.119 --> 00:57:52.170
GRANDMOTHER IN THE FILM WHO

1680
00:57:52.170 --> 00:57:54.119
COMES AND LIVES WITH YOUR

1681
00:57:52.170 --> 00:57:54.119
FAMILY.

1682
00:57:54.119 --> 00:57:55.179
>> MY DAUGHTER.

1683
00:57:54.119 --> 00:57:55.179
>> YES. YES.

1684
00:57:55.179 --> 00:58:00.139
>> MY MOM.

1685
00:57:55.179 --> 00:58:00.139
>> YOU KNOW. FOR ME. THAT -- I

1686
00:58:00.139 --> 00:58:02.000
LOVE THAT PART OF THE MOVIE

1687
00:58:00.139 --> 00:58:02.000
BECAUSE WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL

1688
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:06.269
I MOVED TO AMERICA FROM ITALY.

1689
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:06.269
AND MY GRANDMOTHER LIVED WITH

1690
00:58:06.269 --> 00:58:07.150
US.

1691
00:58:06.269 --> 00:58:07.150
>> YES.

1692
00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:09.030
>> AND WE SHARED A ROOM.

1693
00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:09.030
AND I JUST -- THAT WAS SUCH A

1694
00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:13.150
SPECIAL TIME IN MY LIFE.

1695
00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:13.150
SO. I REALLY CONNECTED TO YOUR

1696
00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:16.090
CHARACTER.

1697
00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:16.090
AND TELL ME. AS A REAL LIFE

1698
00:58:16.090 --> 00:58:19.110
GRANDMOTHER. HOW ARE YOU THE

1699
00:58:16.090 --> 00:58:19.110
SAME AND HOW ARE YOU DIFFERENT

1700
00:58:19.110 --> 00:58:22.059
FROM THE CHARACTER YOU PLAY IN

1701
00:58:19.110 --> 00:58:22.059
THE FILM?

1702
00:58:22.059 --> 00:58:25.219
>> WELL. ACTUALLY I'M NOT LIVING

1703
00:58:22.059 --> 00:58:25.219
WITH MY GRANDSON.

1704
00:58:25.219 --> 00:58:28.289
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

1705
00:58:25.219 --> 00:58:28.289
MOVIE AND THIS.

1706
00:58:28.289 --> 00:58:31.280
>> YES.

1707
00:58:28.289 --> 00:58:31.280
>> AND THEN I'M SURE THAT HE'S

1708
00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:38.139
NOT GOING -- MY GRANDSON WILL

1709
00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:38.139
NOT GIVE ME THE MOUNTAIN DEW AS

1710
00:58:38.139 --> 00:58:42.079
A TEASE.

1711
00:58:38.139 --> 00:58:42.079
>> YES. YES.

1712
00:58:42.079 --> 00:58:47.090
IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT. THERE IS

1713
00:58:42.079 --> 00:58:47.090
A SCENE WHERE YOUR GRANDSON

1714
00:58:47.090 --> 00:58:51.079
GIVES YOU A CUP OF --

1715
00:58:47.090 --> 00:58:51.079
>> YEAH.

1716
00:58:51.079 --> 00:58:53.179
>> YEAH.

1717
00:58:51.079 --> 00:58:53.179
>> JUST SEE THE MOVIE.

1718
00:58:53.179 --> 00:58:55.179
WE THINK IT'S MOUNTAIN DEW. BUT

1719
00:58:53.179 --> 00:58:55.179
IT'S NOT.

1720
00:58:55.179 --> 00:58:58.179
IT'S A GREAT MOVIE FOR MANY

1721
00:58:55.179 --> 00:58:58.179
REASONS.

WE ARE LIVING IN A TIME WHERE WE

1739
00:59:18.269 --> 00:59:21.199
HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THOSE

1740
00:59:21.199 --> 00:59:23.150
THINGS.

1741
00:59:21.199 --> 00:59:23.150

ATTRACTION."

1759
00:59:51.210 --> 00:59:54.159
A COUPLE YEARS AGO. PEOPLE

1760
00:59:54.159 --> 00:59:58.179
THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO GET IT

1761
00:59:54.159 --> 00:59:58.179
WITH "THE WIFE."

1762
00:59:58.179 --> 01:00:02.099
BUT HER FELLOW NOMINEE OLIVIA

SHE WAS AN ICON WHO TOOK A FEW

1801
01:01:00.239 --> 01:01:04.159
I CANNOT HOLD THAT AGAINST HER.

1802
01:01:04.159 --> 01:01:08.190
>> LET'S BE HONEST.

1803
01:01:04.159 --> 01:01:08.190
SHE IS WELL DESERVED OF THE

1804
01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:11.099

1822
01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:17.269
SHE ACTUALLY SAID HERSELF SHE

1823
01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:17.269
HASN'T SEEN A RED CARPET.

1824
01:02:17.269 --> 01:02:21.019
SHE'S DONE IT ALL VIRTUALLY. SO

1825
01:02:17.269 --> 01:02:21.019
THIS IS HER FIRST TIME.

1826
01:02:21.019 --> 01:02:24.070
FOR THE 360 FULL LENGTH SHE'S

1836
01:02:37.159 --> 01:02:40.079
FANTASY WE LOVE TO SEE.

1837
01:02:37.159 --> 01:02:40.079
>> AND IT COULDN'T BE MORE

1838
01:02:40.079 --> 01:02:43.139
DIFFERENT THAN HER CHARACTER.

GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND.

>> WELL. WE'VE BEEN QUARANTINED

1860
01:03:12.179 --> 01:03:16.010
FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF.

1861
01:03:12.179 --> 01:03:16.010
TO SUDDENLY COME OUT IN THIS WAY

1862
01:03:16.010 --> 01:03:19.179

SEND TO WOMEN WHEN THEY WERE

1952
01:05:51.110 --> 01:05:54.030
ENTERING THE INDUSTRY WHEN WE

1953
01:05:51.110 --> 01:05:54.030

SPIKE LEE. THAT SHE LEARNED A

1970
01:06:23.090 --> 01:06:26.139

01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:11.010
WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE SET OF

2046
01:09:11.010 --> 01:09:15.250
NOMINEES THAT MAY NOT HAVE MADE

2047
01:09:11.010 --> 01:09:15.250
IT TO THIS NIGHT IF NOT FOR THE

2048
01:09:15.250 --> 01:09:23.289
GLOBAL BOX OFFICE PAUSE.

2049
01:09:15.250 --> 01:09:23.289
SO MANY STORIES LIKE

2050
01:09:23.289 --> 01:09:25.250
"NOMADLAND." "MINARI." THEY'RE

2051
01:09:23.289 --> 01:09:25.250
GREAT STORIES BUT MIGHT HAVE

2052
01:09:25.250 --> 01:09:31.029
BEEN PUSHED OUT BY "WEST SIDE

2053
01:09:25.250 --> 01:09:31.029
STORY" AND "DOOM."

2054
01:09:31.029 --> 01:09:35.090
LOOK AT THE FILMS AND HOW THEY

2055
01:09:31.029 --> 01:09:35.090
TOUCH ON SOCIAL ISSUES RIGHT

2056
01:09:35.090 --> 01:09:37.189
NOW.

2057
01:09:35.090 --> 01:09:37.189
"MINARI" AND ASIAN HATE SO MUCH.

2058
01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:40.210
>> THAT'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THE

2059
01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:40.210
BEST PICTURE CATEGORY.

2060
01:09:40.210 --> 01:09:43.260
IT'S SOMETHING FOR THE FIRST

2061
01:09:40.210 --> 01:09:43.260
TIME YOU FELT THERE WAS MESSAGES

2062
01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:46.210
COMING ACROSS.

2063
01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:46.210
AS YOU DISCUSSED WE ARE IN A

2064
01:09:46.210 --> 01:09:50.119
TIME RIGHT NOW WHERE WE HAVE TO

2065
01:09:46.210 --> 01:09:50.119
DISCUSS STOP ASIAN HATE. WE HAVE

2066
01:09:50.119 --> 01:09:51.229
TO UNDERSTAND BLACK LIVES

2067
01:09:50.119 --> 01:09:51.229
MATTER.

2068
01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:54.069
IF YOU CAN DO THAT WHILE ALSO

2069
01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:54.069
BEING ENTERTAINED. HOW MUCH FUN

2070
01:09:54.069 --> 01:09:56.159
IS THAT?

2071
01:09:54.069 --> 01:09:56.159
OUT OF THESE MOVIES WHICH ONE DO

2072
01:09:56.159 --> 01:09:58.199
YOU THINK IS GOING TO BE THE ONE

2073
01:09:56.159 --> 01:09:58.199
THAT IS GOING TO WIN?

2074
01:09:58.199 --> 01:10:03.140
>> TAKING IT HOME TONIGHT

2075
01:09:58.199 --> 01:10:03.140
PREDICTABLY WOULD BE "NO

2076
01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:06.050
MADLAND."

2077
01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:06.050
IT'S GOT THE CRITICS CHOICE.

2078
01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:10.010
HOWEVER WE HAVE SEEN THIS STORY

2079
01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:10.010
BEFORE WITH A LITTLE FILM CALLED

2080
01:10:10.010 --> 01:10:14.250
"LA LALAND" THAT ENDED UP LOSING

2081
01:10:10.010 --> 01:10:14.250
SOME OSCAR NIGHT.

2082
01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:16.229
I'M NOT GOING TO COUNT MY

2083
01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:16.229
CHICKENS.

2084
01:10:16.229 --> 01:10:25.100
I'M STILL BETTING ON

2085
01:10:16.229 --> 01:10:25.100
"NOMADLAND."

2086
01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:28.000
BUT "TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7."

2087
01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:28.000
THEY LIVED THROUGH THOSE

2088
01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.279
MOMENTS.

2089
01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.279
>> I LOVE THE FACT SACHA BARON

2090
01:10:31.279 --> 01:10:35.229
COHEN IS GIVING US SOMETHING

2091
01:10:31.279 --> 01:10:35.229
NEW.

2092
01:10:35.229 --> 01:10:44.140
TO GO FROM "BORAT" TO THIS.

2093
01:10:35.229 --> 01:10:44.140
>> HE'S MADE HISTORY WITH "THE

2094
01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:49.199
GOD FATHER" AS THE ONLY TWO

2095
01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:49.199
SEQUELS TO BE NOMINATED.

2096
01:10:49.199 --> 01:10:52.250
I THINK HE ALSO HAS A VERY GOOD

2097
01:10:49.199 --> 01:10:52.250
CHANCE OF WINNING THAT CATEGORY.

2098
01:10:52.250 --> 01:10:59.039
I'M NOT BETTING ON IT. BUT HE

2099
01:10:52.250 --> 01:10:59.039
COULD.

2100
01:10:59.039 --> 01:11:00.170
>> I LOVE THAT WE HAVE ALL THIS

2101
01:10:59.039 --> 01:11:00.170
INSIDE INFORMATION RIGHT NOW.

2102
01:11:00.170 --> 01:11:01.199
THIS IS GREAT.

2103
01:11:00.170 --> 01:11:01.199
WE WANT TO HEAD TO YOU GUYS.

2104
01:11:01.199 --> 01:11:03.210

2105
01:11:01.199 --> 01:11:03.210

2106
01:11:03.210 --> 01:11:06.140
>> ALL THE CHEESE.

2107
01:11:03.210 --> 01:11:06.140
>> I NEED TO WATCH THE

2108
01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:09.079
SCREENERS. JACQUELINE.

2109
01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:09.079
>> I TOLD YOU. GIRL.

2110
01:11:09.079 --> 01:11:12.210

01:11:09.079 --> 01:11:12.210
DRESSES. GIRL. WE WILL GET YOU

2112
01:11:12.210 --> 01:11:17.079
CAUGHT UP ON OSCAR TRIVIA.

2113
01:11:12.210 --> 01:11:17.079
>> SHE MEANS THOSE DRESSES AT

2114
01:11:17.079 --> 01:11:18.250
MACY'S.

2115
01:11:17.079 --> 01:11:18.250
>> SOMEBODY DON'T LOVE YOU LIKE

2116
01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:21.090
HE LOVES ME. YOU DOING IT WRONG.

2117
01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:21.090
>> AMEN.

2118
01:11:21.090 --> 01:11:24.260
>> AMEN.

2119
01:11:21.090 --> 01:11:24.260
YOU GUYS. THAT WAS THE MOST

2120
01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:30.060
NOMINATED BLACK ACTRESS IN

2121
01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:30.060
HISTORY. VIOLA DAVIS HAS BEEN A

2122
01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:33.260
RED CARPET REGULAR SINCE HER

2123
01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:33.260
DEBUT IN 2009.

2124
01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:36.090
SHE HAS GIVEN US MEMORABLE

2125
01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:36.090
MOMENTS.

2126
01:11:36.090 --> 01:11:40.050
WE HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW

2127
01:11:36.090 --> 01:11:40.050
HER FASHION HAS EVOLVED THROUGH

2128
01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:41.149
THE YEARS.

2129
01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:41.149
>> WITH PLEASURE.

2130
01:11:41.149 --> 01:11:46.100
ONE OF MY FAVORITES.

2131
01:11:41.149 --> 01:11:46.100
LET'S START IN 2009 WITH THIS

2132
01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:51.060
GORGEOUS METALLIC REAM GOWN.

2133
01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:51.060
IT WAS HER FIRST OSCARS RED

2134
01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:54.189
CARPET WHERE SHE WAS NOMINATED

2135
01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:54.189
FOR BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS IN

2136
01:11:54.189 --> 01:11:59.149
THE ROLE -- FOR SUPPORTING ROLE

2137
01:11:54.189 --> 01:11:59.149
IN THE MOVIE "DOUBT" WHICH WAS

2138
01:11:59.149 --> 01:12:01.109
UNBELIEVABLE.

2139
01:11:59.149 --> 01:12:01.109
SHE WAS SO INCREDIBLE.

2140
01:12:01.109 --> 01:12:05.000
>> LOVE THE NATURAL HAIR WITH

2141
01:12:01.109 --> 01:12:05.000
THAT AS WELL.

2142
01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:05.279
>> YEAH.

2143
01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:05.279
WE'RE GOING TO SEE THE

2144
01:12:05.279 --> 01:12:08.170
SILHOUETTE COME THROUGH AS HER

2145
01:12:05.279 --> 01:12:08.170
FASHION EVOLVES AS WELL.

2146
01:12:08.170 --> 01:12:14.010
BUT HER LOOK IN 2012 IS ONE OF

2147
01:12:08.170 --> 01:12:14.010
MY PERSONAL FAVES.

2148
01:12:14.010 --> 01:12:17.229
THIS IS VERA WANG.

2149
01:12:14.010 --> 01:12:17.229
AND WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS GOWN

2150
01:12:17.229 --> 01:12:21.050
IS AGAIN THAT THIS BEAUTIFUL

2151
01:12:17.229 --> 01:12:21.050
BOLD COLOR THAT WE'RE GOING TO

2152
01:12:21.050 --> 01:12:24.060
SEE SHE KIND OF CONTINUES ALL

2153
01:12:21.050 --> 01:12:24.060
THE WAY THROUGH. WHICH I LOVE

2154
01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:26.079
ABOUT HER.

2155
01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:26.079
SHE EMBRACES COLOR.

2156
01:12:26.079 --> 01:12:30.000
SHE EMBRACES THESE BEAUTIFUL.

2157
01:12:26.079 --> 01:12:30.000
SOPHISTICATED SILHOUETTES.

2158
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.210
AND AS WE SEE HER FASHION

2159
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.210
EVOLVE. YOU CAN JUST SEE SHE IS

2160
01:12:33.210 --> 01:12:37.060
JUST A RED CARPET QUEEN.

2161
01:12:33.210 --> 01:12:37.060
>> AND SHE IS A PERSON WHO WEARS

2162
01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:40.130
THE DRESS.

2163
01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:40.130
THE DRESS DOES NOT WEAR HER.

2164
01:12:40.130 --> 01:12:41.239
>> ABSOLUTELY.

2165
01:12:40.130 --> 01:12:41.239
>> THERE'S SOME PEOPLE YOU SEE.

2166
01:12:41.239 --> 01:12:44.079
YOU'RE LIKE. GIRL. I CAN'T SEE

2167
01:12:41.239 --> 01:12:44.079
YOU IN THAT THING.

2168
01:12:44.079 --> 01:12:48.260
BUT SHE REALLY COMMANDS THE RED

2169
01:12:44.079 --> 01:12:48.260
CARPET.

2170
01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:50.199
>> AND THE COLORS SHE'S WORN

2171
01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:50.199
HAVE BEEN SPECTACULAR.

2172
01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:55.109
>> THE HOT PINK MICHAEL COORS.

2173
01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:55.109
>> THE GREENS AND BLUES AND

2174
01:12:55.109 --> 01:12:57.229
PRINTS AS WELL.

2175
01:12:55.109 --> 01:12:57.229
SHE CAN DO IT SO WELL.

2176
01:12:57.229 --> 01:13:00.159
THE DRESS NEVER WEARS HER.

2177
01:12:57.229 --> 01:13:00.159
>> EVERY SINGLE TIME. GUYS.

2178
01:13:00.159 --> 01:13:03.010
WE'VE GOT TO HEAD OVER TO

2179
01:13:00.159 --> 01:13:03.010

OSCAR RED CARPET.

HOW DOES IT FEEL?

2192
01:13:25.119 --> 01:13:28.100
>> HOW DOES IT FEEL?

2193
01:13:25.119 --> 01:13:28.100
>> IT'S SURREAL.

2194
01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:30.229
>> SURREAL.

2195
01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:30.229
>> NOTHING I EVER EXPECTED THAT

2196
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:35.029
WOULD HAPPEN TO ME.

2197
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:35.029
>> NOTHING YOU EVER EXPECTED

2198
01:13:35.029 --> 01:13:37.229
WOULD HAPPEN TO YOU.

2199
01:13:35.029 --> 01:13:37.229
IT'S PRETTY GREAT. ISN'T IT?

>> IT'S AWESOME. YES.

2201
01:13:37.229 --> 01:13:40.109
>> WHAT SHE SAID.

2202
01:13:40.109 --> 01:13:44.279
AND I'M NOT AN ACTOR.

2203
01:13:40.109 --> 01:13:44.279
IT'S NOT ACTING THAT'S OSCAR

2204
01:13:44.279 --> 01:13:47.180
WORTHY.

2205
01:13:44.279 --> 01:13:47.180
IT'S MY NOMADIC LIFESTYLE THAT'S

2206
01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:51.260
OSCAR WORTHY.

WHY WAS THAT IMPORTANT TO YOU?

2215
01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:05.029
>> WELL. ACTUALLY THEY SAY THAT

2216
01:14:05.029 --> 01:14:09.039
THE GREATEST MAGIC TRICK IS TO

MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE IT JUST

01:14:09.039 --> 01:14:11.090
HAPPENED.

2219
01:14:09.039 --> 01:14:11.090
WE ACTUALLY HAD AN ENTIRE

2220
01:14:11.090 --> 01:14:15.130
AMAZING PRODUCING TEAM THAT

2221
01:14:11.090 --> 01:14:15.130

WHEN WE GET THERE. WE GET TO

01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:25.229
SOMETIMES TO CAPTURE IT. WE HAVE

2228
01:14:25.229 --> 01:14:30.029
TO HAVE THAT FREEDOM.

2229
01:14:25.229 --> 01:14:30.029
>> AND YOU KNOW. I KNOW. CHLOE.

2230
01:14:30.029 --> 01:14:32.079
THIS MOVIE IS SO IMPORTANT TO

01:14:30.029 --> 01:14:32.079
YOU.

2232
01:14:32.079 --> 01:14:33.270
IT REALLY HAS A PIECE OF YOUR

2233
01:14:32.079 --> 01:14:33.270
HEART.

2234
01:14:33.270 --> 01:14:37.010
HOW DID THIS EXPERIENCE CHANGE

2235
01:14:33.270 --> 01:14:37.010
YOU AS A PERSON?

2236
01:14:37.010 --> 01:14:41.289
>> YOU KNOW. I FEEL LIKE

2237
01:14:37.010 --> 01:14:41.289
SOMETIMES FILM MAKING COULD BE A

2238
01:14:41.289 --> 01:14:48.100
QUITE LONELY AND TRANSIENT

2239
01:14:41.289 --> 01:14:48.100
EXISTENCE.

2240
01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:50.289
WE GO FROM MOVIES TO MOVIES TO

2241
01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:50.289

NOMADS. WHO ALSO LIVE A

2244
01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:57.119
TRANSIENT LIFE. BUT THERE'S A

2245
01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:57.119
GREAT SENSE OF COMMUNITY THAT

2246
01:14:57.119 --> 01:14:59.260
THEY'VE BUILT FOR THEMSELVES.

2247
01:14:57.119 --> 01:14:59.260
THAT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE PART

2248
01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:06.130
OF SOMETHING BIGGER.

2249
01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:06.130
AND I TRY TO SEE THINGS THE SAME

2250
01:15:06.130 --> 01:15:07.119

EVERYONE HAS LOVED THIS FILM.

2255
01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:13.090
WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO YOU TO HAVE

2256
01:15:13.090 --> 01:15:16.170
FOUR NOMINATIONS TONIGHT?

2257
01:15:13.090 --> 01:15:16.170
>> THAT --

2258
01:15:16.170 --> 01:15:19.180
>> WELL. FROM MY POINT OF VIEW.

2259
01:15:16.170 --> 01:15:19.180
IT'S JUST ALREADY BEEN SUCH A

2260
01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:21.220
GREAT JOURNEY.

2261
01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:21.220

HEARTS AND STORIES TO US IS

2265
01:15:25.229 --> 01:15:32.180
REALLY BEEN WONDERFUL.

2266
01:15:32.180 --> 01:16:06.250
OSCA

01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:10.210
THE ANTICIPATION IS BUILDING.

2270
01:16:10.210 --> 01:16:22.220
THE OSCARS ARE LIVE ON ABC ON

01:16:33.239 --> 01:16:34.220
>> CALM.

2280
01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:37.210
>> CALM.

2281
01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:37.210
>> IF PEOPLE WERE HERE. THEY

2282
01:16:37.210 --> 01:16:40.100
WOULD KNOW HOW ABSOLUTELY

2283
01:16:37.210 --> 01:16:40.100
GROUNDBREAKING CALM IS.

01:16:57.039 --> 01:17:00.289
AN ALREADY FABULOUS EXPERIENCE

2297
01:16:57.039 --> 01:17:00.289
IN EVERY SINGLE WAY.

2298
01:17:00.289 --> 01:17:06.119

IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN A BETTER

2302
01:17:09.109 --> 01:17:12.039
EXPERIENCE AND NOW IT'S JUST

2303
01:17:09.109 --> 01:17:12.039
CONTINUING.

2304
01:17:12.039 --> 01:17:14.220
>> AND YOU ARE SO BRILLIANT IN

2305
01:17:12.039 --> 01:17:14.220
THIS FILM.

2306
01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:19.000
JULIUS. I GOT TO ASK YOU. WE

2307
01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:19.000
KNOW SHE'S A BRILLIANT ACTRESS.

2308
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.140
WAS THERE ANYTHING IN THIS FILM

2309
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.140
IN PARTICULAR THAT SHOCKED EVEN

2310
01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:32.130
YOU MAYBE THAT YOU WENT WOW?

2311
01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:32.130
>> WELL. YOU KNOW. IT WAS REALLY

2312
01:17:32.130 --> 01:17:38.090
A CHOICE OF PUTTING THE GOAL IN.

2313
01:17:32.130 --> 01:17:38.090
IT WAS AMAZING. AND IT COMPLETED

2314
01:17:38.090 --> 01:17:44.140
THE TRANSFORMATION WITH THE SUIT

2315
01:17:38.090 --> 01:17:44.140
AND THE MAKE UP.

2316
01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:47.170
BUT THOSE TEETH -- THOSE GRILLS

2317
01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:47.170
WERE AMAZING.

2318
01:17:47.170 --> 01:17:51.250
>> GRILLS IS WHAT THEY CALL

2319
01:17:47.170 --> 01:17:51.250
THEM.

2320
01:17:51.250 --> 01:17:54.260
>> YOU WERE LIKE I'M TAKING THIS

2321
01:17:51.250 --> 01:17:54.260
TRANSFORMATION VERY SERIOUSLY.

2322
01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:57.170
I NEED THIS TO BE AS AUTHENTIC

2323
01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:57.170
AS POSSIBLE.

2324
01:17:57.170 --> 01:17:59.090
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR APPROACH TO

2325
01:17:57.170 --> 01:17:59.090
THAT.

2326
01:17:59.090 --> 01:18:02.090
>> THE APPROACH TO THAT IS THE

2327
01:17:59.090 --> 01:18:02.090
APPROACH EVERY ACTOR HAS TO HAVE

2328
01:18:02.090 --> 01:18:04.130
TO IT.

2329
01:18:02.090 --> 01:18:04.130
YOU HAVE TO HONOR THE PERSON.

2330
01:18:04.130 --> 01:18:06.250
THEY SAID SHE WAS A CERTAIN

2331
01:18:04.130 --> 01:18:06.250
SIZE.

2332
01:18:06.250 --> 01:18:13.010
THEY SAID THAT SHE HAD A MOUTH

2333
01:18:06.250 --> 01:18:13.010
FULL OF GOLD TEETH.

2334
01:18:13.010 --> 01:18:16.210
THEY SAID SHE LOOKED A CERTAIN

2335
01:18:13.010 --> 01:18:16.210
WAY. HORSE HAIR WIGS.

2336
01:18:16.210 --> 01:18:20.010
SO. GUESS WHAT.

2337
01:18:16.210 --> 01:18:20.010
I HAD GOLD TEETH. HORSE HAIR

2338
01:18:20.010 --> 01:18:23.090
WIGS AND I WAS A CERTAIN SIZE.

2339
01:18:20.010 --> 01:18:23.090
I DIDN'T WANT TO CHANGE HER IN

2340
01:18:23.090 --> 01:18:26.039
ANY WAY BECAUSE THEN I WOULD BE

2341
01:18:23.090 --> 01:18:26.039
APOLOGIZING AND I WOULD BE

2342
01:18:26.039 --> 01:18:27.289
WATERING IT DOWN.

2343
01:18:26.039 --> 01:18:27.289
SO. YEAH.

2344
01:18:27.289 --> 01:18:32.229

01:18:32.229 --> 01:18:35.270
CHADWICK BOSEMAN.

2348
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:40.100

2349
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:40.100
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO YOU. HAVING

TALENTED. HE'S SUCH A -- YOU

2357
01:18:54.270 --> 01:18:57.229
ALWAYS HEAR WHAT AN INCREDIBLE

2358
01:18:57.229 --> 01:19:00.029
PERSON HE WAS.

2359
01:18:57.229 --> 01:19:00.029
BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO YOU

2360
01:19:00.029 --> 01:19:03.000
THROUGHOUT THIS AWARD SEASON

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.079
POURING IN?

2363
01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.079
>> IT FEELS RIGHT ONLY BECAUSE I

2364
01:19:06.079 --> 01:19:08.159
KNOW HIM.

2365
01:19:06.079 --> 01:19:08.159
IT WAS LIKE I SAID BEFORE. HE

2366
01:19:08.159 --> 01:19:13.000
WAS AUTHENTICITY ON STEROIDS.

2367
01:19:08.159 --> 01:19:13.000
SOMETIMES PEOPLE HONOR PEOPLE

2368
01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.229
WHO ACTUALLY WERE NOT REALLY

2369
01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.229
NICE OR REALLY THE PERSONA DID

2370
01:19:17.229 --> 01:19:22.199
NOT MATCH THE REAL PERSON.

2371
01:19:17.229 --> 01:19:22.199
THIS. IT MATCHES A PERSON.

2372
01:19:22.199 --> 01:19:26.199
I'M TELLING YOU. THIS PERSON.

2373
01:19:22.199 --> 01:19:26.199
THIS HUMAN BEING. THIS ARTIST

DID NOT MISTAKE HIS PRESENCE FOR

2375
01:19:26.199 --> 01:19:29.180
THE EVENT.

2376
01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:33.180
HE ABSOLUTELY HONORED THE WORK.

2377
01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:33.180
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ENTER THIS

2378
01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:35.189
BUSINESS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE

2379
01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:35.189
FAMOUS ACTORS.

2380
01:19:35.189 --> 01:19:39.100
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE ACTORS.

2381
01:19:35.189 --> 01:19:39.100
THEY WANT TO BE FAMOUS ACTORS.

2382
01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:41.250
HE ENTERED IT BECAUSE HE JUST

2383
01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:41.250
WANTED TO BE AN ARTIST.

2384
01:19:41.250 --> 01:19:44.039
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

2385
01:19:41.250 --> 01:19:44.039
