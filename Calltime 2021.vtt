I'm Cuban. love being a

opportunity to be the sound

engineer on the
greatest horror film ever.

183
00:13:05.385 --> 00:13:08.755
I was surprised that
you called actually being

184
00:13:08.755 --> 00:13:12.059
that I've never worked
on a film and all...

185
00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:16.463
but I think... no. I know I'm
ready.

186
00:13:19.967 --> 00:13:22.302
Yo. yo. yo. it's your boy k

187
00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:25.038
Chalmers...
but my peeps call me D.C.

188
00:13:25.906 --> 00:13:29.476

00:13:31.244 --> 00:13:33.213
this side of
motherfucking Mississippi.

191
00:13:34.614 --> 00:13:37.384
I'll admit this is my first
feature but...

192
00:13:38.085 --> 00:13:40.420
I was built for this. I've gt
this.

193
00:13:42.923 --> 00:13:45.225
I can't wait until we
actually start shooting

194
00:13:45.225 --> 00:13:47.494
because that's when
I'm at my absolute best.

195
00:13:47.928 --> 00:13:48.929
Hands down.

196
00:14:01.008 --> 00:14:02.142
I'm Ethan Shaw.

197
00:14:04.644 --> 00:14:05.946
The Ethan Shaw.

198
00:14:05.946 --> 00:14:08.481
No. just Ethan Shaw.

199
00:14:10.783 --> 00:14:12.085
That's about it.

200
00:14:14.587 --> 00:14:17.357
Come on Ethan. you can do better
than that.

201
00:14:18.491 --> 00:14:21.361
Can I go for him. please.
please. let me go.

202
00:14:21.828 --> 00:14:24.531
I got you bro. I'm not gonna let
you down. Thank you.

203
00:14:26.433 --> 00:14:29.602
Ladies and gentleman. this is
Ethan Shaw.

204
00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:32.772
Ethan made a name
for himself with his

205
00:14:32.772 --> 00:14:35.275
very first film at the
tender age of 20.

206
00:14:35.508 --> 00:14:36.843
Johnny's room.

207
00:14:36.843 --> 00:14:39.779
Which made him a highly sougt
after director.

208
00:14:39.779 --> 00:14:42.983
He followed it up again with his
next film which was even better.

209
00:14:42.983 --> 00:14:44.551
[low ominous music]

210
00:14:44.551 --> 00:14:48.121
By the tender age of 22 Ethan
was Mr. Fucking Hollywood.

211
00:14:49.689 --> 00:14:51.558
Until he pissed it all away.

212
00:14:51.558 --> 00:14:54.527
Right. Ethan?

213
00:14:59.632 --> 00:15:01.634
Your water's better than min.

214
00:15:07.507 --> 00:15:09.376
How did he piss it all away?

215
00:15:10.577 --> 00:15:13.013
Do you wanna tell 'em? Nah. I
got it.

216
00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:18.185
He got addicted to coke bee
we all know that crack is .

217
00:15:18.185 --> 00:15:21.721
Showed up to set drunk. late.
fucking anything he could touch.

218
00:15:22.355 --> 00:15:24.724
Hollywood all but blacklisted
the man.

219
00:15:24.724 --> 00:15:28.561
Not to mention his baby-momma is
suing him for child support.

220
00:15:29.229 --> 00:15:33.533
You know just your typicalE
True Hollywood... tragic s.

221
00:15:34.867 --> 00:15:35.935
Is this gravy?

222
00:15:37.537 --> 00:15:39.106
What? I Googled him.

223
00:15:51.384 --> 00:15:54.621
Hey Ethan. my bad for calling
you out on dinner man.

224
00:15:55.255 --> 00:15:56.256
My bad. bro.

225
00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:59.559
What are you doing? You mar
real?

226
00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.196
Nah. no kiss. no hugs?

227
00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:06.466
And then there was one.

[disconcerting music]

229
00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:32.492
They think they're better thn
me. I'll show them.

230
00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.595
You wait and see. I'll show
them.

231
00:16:37.164 --> 00:16:38.331
I'll show them.

233
00:17:01.421 --> 00:17:02.422
Ethan.

234
00:17:03.256 --> 00:17:05.024
Walk with me. talk with me.

235
00:17:05.592 --> 00:17:06.593
Alright.

236
00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:11.298
Now you have been unusually
quiet since you got here.

237
00:17:11.298 --> 00:17:13.833
I know you must have
some questions for

238
00:17:13.833 --> 00:17:16.369
me. you are directing
the film after all.

239
00:17:18.771 --> 00:17:22.209
You're probably wondering.t
have I got myself into?

240
00:17:22.475 --> 00:17:24.144
That had crossed my mind.

241
00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.949
You've got a bunch
of college kids...

242
00:17:29.949 --> 00:17:32.452
inexperienced
college kids at that.

243
00:17:32.785 --> 00:17:37.124
working on what's supposed to be
the best horror film ever;

244
00:17:38.291 --> 00:17:40.493
and where's the rest of your
crew?

245
00:17:42.028 --> 00:17:43.830
I tried making this picture with

246
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:45.898
union guys.
it wouldn't come together.

247
00:17:47.467 --> 00:17:50.002
So I figured. why not try h
talent?

248
00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:54.307
As for the rest of the crew.
they're gonna be here soon.

249
00:17:54.307 --> 00:17:56.743
I brought a handful of you ot
here early.

250
00:17:56.743 --> 00:17:59.846
So you could all get to knw
each other a little bit be.

251
00:17:59.846 --> 00:18:02.549
It's really necessary
if I'm gonna pull off...

252
00:18:03.216 --> 00:18:04.717
what I'm trying to pull off.

253
00:18:06.052 --> 00:18:08.388
And what are you trying tol
off?

254
00:18:09.189 --> 00:18:13.260
Like I said... make the be.
horror film... ever.

255
00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:20.700
We're not that
different you and I.

256
00:18:23.203 --> 00:18:24.871
How do you figure that?

257
00:18:26.206 --> 00:18:28.908
We both tasted the success of
Hollywood.

258
00:18:28.908 --> 00:18:31.444
We know what it's like to be
elevated.

259
00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:33.680
Bolstered around
like kings before

260
00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.882
being spit out and
being forgotten.

261
00:18:36.383 --> 00:18:39.852
Left to rot like road-kill on
the side of the street

262
00:18:39.852 --> 00:18:41.921
but we didn't let that sto.

263
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:45.192
Despite public opinion we roe

264
00:18:45.192 --> 00:18:47.194
from the ashes
and voyaged forth.

265
00:18:48.528 --> 00:18:49.762
We're survivors.

266
00:18:54.301 --> 00:18:56.569
What if I told you
this film was our

267
00:18:56.569 --> 00:18:59.105
chance to get back
to that grand stage?

268
00:19:00.106 --> 00:19:03.476
What if I told you the glam. the
lights. the attention...

269
00:19:05.212 --> 00:19:06.879
you can have it all back.

270
00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:10.149
What would you do for it?

271
00:19:14.254 --> 00:19:15.788
Excuse me. I gotta take this.

272
00:19:15.788 --> 00:19:16.756
Alright.

here?

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:34.701
What about him?

297

He's your roommate.

What's up with you two?

300
00:20:40.807 --> 00:20:42.409
You went in on him pretty had
at dinner.

301
00:20:44.143 --> 00:20:46.646
There's just something
about him I don't

302
00:20:46.646 --> 00:20:49.248
like. that dude just
gives me a shady vibe.

303
00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:51.418
I feel that same way about Sean.

trust our intuition.

305

325
00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:30.783
So you gonna tell me why you
have that gun?

00:22:31.951 --> 00:22:34.186
Cause it's my right as an
American.

327
00:22:34.487 --> 00:22:37.023
Do you bring it to all your
movie sets?

328
00:22:37.023 --> 00:22:38.858
I take it every where I go.

329
00:22:40.827 --> 00:22:44.030
I never liked guns. not even
water guns.

330
00:22:44.864 --> 00:22:46.933
Not me. I've always loved .

They were always around as a kid
too.

332

that sat above the
fireplace in the den.

Till this day it's my favorie
gun.

And all the violence
and carnage that's

336
00:23:02.949 --> 00:23:05.685
associated with them...
don't bother you?

337
00:23:06.152 --> 00:23:07.954
In my experience. this world

338
00:23:07.954 --> 00:23:10.122
doesn't give you
much of a choice.

339
00:23:13.292 --> 00:23:14.994
We always have a choice.

340
00:23:24.837 --> 00:23:26.973
What were you doing out there
all alone anyway?

341
00:23:28.541 --> 00:23:30.877
Well. your childhood was fd

342
00:23:30.877 --> 00:23:33.546
with guns...
mine with the outdoors.

surrounded by trees.

00:23:39.318 --> 00:23:41.921

under one.

eventually writing.

for inspiration.

It's my safe place.

There are no safe places.

we go.

00:25:12.579 --> 00:25:14.246
Thanks for the ride to the
store.

357
00:25:14.246 --> 00:25:17.817
No problem. I had to get some
stuff for the house anyway.

358
00:25:24.657 --> 00:25:26.593
[woman]
Exactly. I just find some kid

359
00:25:26.593 --> 00:25:28.127
of time to do something.

360
00:25:38.971 --> 00:25:42.775
Ok. you get what you need and
I'll meet you at the registe.

361
00:25:45.712 --> 00:25:47.513
That guy looks so familiar.

362
00:25:49.782 --> 00:25:52.218
Look. I'm gonna talk to you
later. ok.

363
00:25:52.484 --> 00:25:54.153
I'll talk to you later.

365
00:26:07.867 --> 00:26:08.868
Hi.

366
00:26:11.237 --> 00:26:12.238
Hello.

367
00:26:13.806 --> 00:26:16.142
I heard you. what can I ger
you?

368
00:26:21.681 --> 00:26:23.415
Hey. you're that director.

369
00:26:24.383 --> 00:26:25.384
Yea.

370
00:26:25.384 --> 00:26:27.553
The director that did that movie
at that house.

371
00:26:27.553 --> 00:26:28.387
Uh huh.

372
00:26:28.387 --> 00:26:30.156
My sister she...

373
00:26:30.156 --> 00:26:32.825
she was working with you on that

374
00:26:32.825 --> 00:26:35.394
film and I haven't
seen her since.

375
00:26:37.163 --> 00:26:39.331
You all back shooting
that movie again? I thought

376
00:26:39.331 --> 00:26:41.600
you all learned your
lesson from the last time.

377
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.535
What happened the last time?

378
00:26:43.535 --> 00:26:45.204
A disaster. that's what.

379
00:26:47.273 --> 00:26:48.941
I'm not following you.

380
00:26:49.375 --> 00:26:51.110
You don't know it. do you?

381
00:26:51.577 --> 00:26:54.246
Just like Sean to keep you in
the dark.

382
00:26:54.246 --> 00:26:56.415
You gotta be
careful with that Sean

383
00:26:56.415 --> 00:26:58.751
Bischer.
he isn't who he appears to b.

384
00:26:58.751 --> 00:26:59.886
And who he is?

385
00:27:00.619 --> 00:27:03.856
I don't know. ask the lastm
crew that was here.

386
00:27:04.523 --> 00:27:07.694
I mean I don't really keep track
of people after we wrap. so...

387
00:27:07.694 --> 00:27:11.563
No. no. no. she told me whe
she was... she told me. wee

388
00:27:11.563 --> 00:27:13.766
gonna meet up afterwards and she

389
00:27:13.766 --> 00:27:15.935
just wouldn't
disappear like that.

390
00:27:15.935 --> 00:27:18.905
Ok well she's a grown woman
so maybe she went out of tow.

391
00:27:18.905 --> 00:27:21.741
maybe she's at the beach.
I can't help you. I'm sorry.

392
00:27:22.041 --> 00:27:24.911
Just tell me where she is.
Just tell me where she

393
00:27:24.911 --> 00:27:27.646
is! Just tell me where she i.
I just wanna know.

394
00:27:27.646 --> 00:27:29.548
You gotta calm down right no.
I can't help

395
00:27:29.548 --> 00:27:31.383
you. I can't do anything
for you. I'm sorry.

396
00:27:31.383 --> 00:27:33.786
You're a liar. you're a fug
liar.

397
00:27:34.286 --> 00:27:36.455
You know exactly where she i!

398
00:27:36.455 --> 00:27:37.456
[ominous music]

399
00:27:37.456 --> 00:27:39.458
Do not mess with me right no.

400
00:27:40.793 --> 00:27:41.794
Stay there.

401
00:27:58.177 --> 00:28:01.080
Let's get out of here. these
people are crazy.

402
00:28:04.683 --> 00:28:06.285
[eery ominous music]

403
00:28:36.682 --> 00:28:40.352
Uh you mind telling me what that
was all about back there?

404
00:28:41.954 --> 00:28:43.655
What was what all about?

405
00:28:44.056 --> 00:28:46.358
Uh the argument
you were having with

406
00:28:46.358 --> 00:28:48.627
the woman in the
back of the store.

407
00:28:49.328 --> 00:28:51.530
That was nothing.

408
00:28:52.832 --> 00:28:56.302
That cashier said something
about a previous film crew.

409
00:28:56.803 --> 00:28:58.404
Oh she did. did she?

410
00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:02.341
Yea. what happened to the
previous film crew?

411
00:29:03.709 --> 00:29:06.846
What happened was they camt
here to make a film

412
00:29:07.479 --> 00:29:09.381
and between budgets and talet

413
00:29:09.381 --> 00:29:11.683
schedules we
couldn't make the film.

414
00:29:16.322 --> 00:29:19.025
I don't know man.
the cashier seemed pretty

415
00:29:19.025 --> 00:29:22.094
upset and so did the
girl you were arguing with.

416
00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:26.698
Look Ethan. I'm gonna
drop a little nugget on

417
00:29:26.698 --> 00:29:29.401
you about small towns.
they don't like outsiders.

418
00:29:30.002 --> 00:29:32.271
Especially ones
that threaten to turn

419
00:29:32.271 --> 00:29:34.907
their hick town into
the next Hollywood.

420
00:29:36.042 --> 00:29:39.411
I wouldn't put too much enery
into these people. I don't.

421
00:29:45.852 --> 00:29:47.519
What do we have here?

422
00:29:49.621 --> 00:29:52.458
[sighs]
Look... I hope he knows that

423
00:29:52.458 --> 00:29:53.792
we're not filming in this.

424
00:29:53.792 --> 00:29:55.694
That's why you bring your own
equipment.

425
00:29:55.694 --> 00:29:59.731
Oh yea? What do you think r
little zoom recorder is sa?

426
00:29:59.731 --> 00:30:03.802
Look. if this film is as bs
Sean says it is...

427
00:30:04.703 --> 00:30:06.805
we're gonna need better
equipment. For God sake...

428
00:30:07.473 --> 00:30:09.541
Abi can't even use
a damn laptop...

429
00:30:09.541 --> 00:30:11.577
hey Abi.
how you doing over there?

430
00:30:12.544 --> 00:30:13.545
Good?

431
00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:15.247
Huh? Ok.

432
00:30:15.647 --> 00:30:17.283
See what I'm saying?

433
00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:24.423
Now. this is more my speed

434
00:30:24.423 --> 00:30:28.394
my appetite. my flavor.
oh my gosh look at the

435
00:30:28.394 --> 00:30:32.231
legs and body on this beauty.
oh my mmm...

436
00:30:33.632 --> 00:30:34.600
This is a...

437
00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:39.571
Vintage Panasonic...
manufactured in 1987.

438
00:30:40.806 --> 00:30:41.807
Classic.

439
00:30:42.608 --> 00:30:44.076
You know your cameras.

440
00:30:44.076 --> 00:30:47.914
Told you. the best DP thise
of motherfucking Mississip.

441
00:30:49.848 --> 00:30:51.583
I'll leave you two
to get to know

442
00:30:51.583 --> 00:30:53.319
the equipment better. Abigai.

443
00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:56.622
Would you come with me pleas?

444
00:30:58.757 --> 00:31:01.660
If I'm DP'ing this we can
definitely use this.

445
00:31:02.128 --> 00:31:04.163
There's some... depending .

446
00:31:04.163 --> 00:31:05.664
With this as props.

447
00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:12.438
[ominous music]

448
00:31:24.283 --> 00:31:26.018
How's the script writing coming?

449
00:31:26.018 --> 00:31:27.819
I'm making some good notes...

450
00:31:27.819 --> 00:31:30.356
I'm focusing on character
development and I

451
00:31:30.356 --> 00:31:33.192
think I should be ready
to start writing soon.

452
00:31:33.993 --> 00:31:36.328
Good. When creating your
protagonist...

453
00:31:37.863 --> 00:31:40.466
make sure you choose
characteristics that

454
00:31:40.466 --> 00:31:42.969
align with the
narrative of the film.

455
00:31:42.969 --> 00:31:44.503
Is he a family man?

456
00:31:45.137 --> 00:31:46.738
Is he a betting man?

457
00:31:46.738 --> 00:31:48.174
Is he a man's man?

458
00:31:49.008 --> 00:31:51.643
When his back is up
against the wall. what

459
00:31:51.643 --> 00:31:54.546
is he going to do?
What does he have to lose?

460
00:31:56.682 --> 00:31:58.550
Do you know what empathy is?

461
00:32:00.919 --> 00:32:04.356
The ability to share and feel
the feelings of another?

462
00:32:04.756 --> 00:32:07.326
Every great script
captures empathy in a

463
00:32:07.326 --> 00:32:09.828
way that brings the
characters to life.

464
00:32:11.163 --> 00:32:13.765
Now if you want to
be a truly great writer

465
00:32:13.765 --> 00:32:16.168
you have to write
truly great scripts.

466
00:32:16.168 --> 00:32:19.538
Do you know the secret to
writing truly great scripts?

467
00:32:20.572 --> 00:32:21.573
Practice?

468
00:32:23.075 --> 00:32:25.111
Practice ain't hurt nobody bt

469
00:32:25.111 --> 00:32:27.113
no that's not
what I'm going for.

470
00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:45.564
Did you feel that?

471
00:32:47.199 --> 00:32:48.200
Feel what?

472
00:32:48.967 --> 00:32:51.770
That uncomfortable feeling
you're emitting.

473
00:32:52.471 --> 00:32:55.741
I sat down next to you on ths
bed and you felt...

474
00:32:55.741 --> 00:33:00.146
tense. apprehensive. confused
even.

475
00:33:03.415 --> 00:33:05.884
The secret to
writing a hero that

476
00:33:05.884 --> 00:33:08.954
everyone will
remember is vulnerability.

477
00:33:10.489 --> 00:33:12.158
You have got to be open.

478
00:33:13.825 --> 00:33:15.761
You've gotta go
deeper than you've

479
00:33:15.761 --> 00:33:17.629
ever gone before where it's dark

480
00:33:17.629 --> 00:33:19.565
and scary and
mucky and it's where

481
00:33:19.565 --> 00:33:21.433
comfort and security go to.

482
00:33:23.069 --> 00:33:27.306
Leaving behind only the put
form of yourself. of all o.

483
00:33:30.276 --> 00:33:34.246
There's only one thing than
survive there. one thing o.

484
00:33:37.183 --> 00:33:38.184
Truth.

485
00:33:41.753 --> 00:33:42.754
So.

486
00:33:46.192 --> 00:33:47.926
What do you want me to do?

487
00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:55.534
I want you to go to your safe
place...

488
00:33:57.203 --> 00:33:59.638
and I want you to let all the
fear in...

489
00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:04.343
and don't be afraid to make t
your bitch.

490
00:34:07.045 --> 00:34:08.780
Can you do that for me?

491
00:34:10.382 --> 00:34:11.383
I could try.

492
00:34:12.851 --> 00:34:14.853
I don't need you to try.

493
00:34:17.656 --> 00:34:19.558
I need you to make it happen.

494
00:34:21.293 --> 00:34:22.961
Can you do that for me?

495
00:34:26.898 --> 00:34:28.634
I could do that for you.

496
00:34:31.036 --> 00:34:32.037
Good.

497
00:34:37.543 --> 00:34:39.245
So what's this button for?

498
00:34:42.047 --> 00:34:44.216
So are you gonna tell me or
what? Ow.

499
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:47.018
So don't mess with your
equipment. ok.

500
00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:50.222
That's the guy that I know.

501
00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:52.658
Give me a moment. alright.

502
00:34:55.894 --> 00:34:59.598
Hey. I got something to cos
to you.

503
00:35:00.266 --> 00:35:02.568
Yea? What's that?

504
00:35:03.169 --> 00:35:05.204
So you're like one of the man

505
00:35:05.204 --> 00:35:07.206
reasons why I
became a filmmaker.

506
00:35:07.673 --> 00:35:08.874
Yea. seriously.

507
00:35:10.442 --> 00:35:11.443
Yea.

508
00:35:17.683 --> 00:35:20.252
I guess it was probably whenI
was like 11 or 12.

509
00:35:21.287 --> 00:35:24.022
I must have been on my fourth
foster home.

510
00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:28.294
And this one was by far the
worst.

511
00:35:29.361 --> 00:35:30.362
Yea.

512
00:35:30.896 --> 00:35:33.765
I got scars and cigarette s
to prove it.

513
00:35:36.568 --> 00:35:39.471
Every night was
just a particular

514
00:35:39.471 --> 00:35:41.740
chaos and horror for me.

515
00:35:44.376 --> 00:35:46.044
Except for one night.

516
00:35:47.979 --> 00:35:48.980
Nah.

517
00:35:49.748 --> 00:35:52.484
One night something
made me feel like

518
00:35:52.484 --> 00:35:55.153
I was. someone else.
somewhere else.

519
00:35:56.288 --> 00:35:58.056
Gave me a glimmer of hope.

520
00:36:00.058 --> 00:36:02.127
It was your movie. Heartbr.

521
00:36:03.629 --> 00:36:06.832
I'll admit. I wasn't too cray
about the story line

522
00:36:07.466 --> 00:36:11.503
but the visual. just the vl
story you told

523
00:36:12.304 --> 00:36:16.141
was just some of the best I'e
ever seen. still to this day.

524
00:36:16.141 --> 00:36:18.944
The direction. the angles and
the lighting.

525
00:36:19.611 --> 00:36:20.779
Just brilliant.

526
00:36:22.848 --> 00:36:24.182
Brilliant my man.

527
00:36:24.983 --> 00:36:27.118
I knew right then and there
that...

528
00:36:29.455 --> 00:36:31.189
I wanted to be a filmmaker...

529
00:36:32.358 --> 00:36:33.359
and uh...

530
00:36:34.693 --> 00:36:37.162
I would tell anyone that woud
listen.

531
00:36:38.497 --> 00:36:40.165
Even my foster parents.

532
00:36:41.099 --> 00:36:46.838
They would laugh of course bt
shit. see me now. right?

533
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:54.946
Wait a minute. you remembered
the scene in the kitchen...

534
00:36:56.147 --> 00:36:57.349
with the uncle?

535
00:36:57.716 --> 00:37:01.787
Yes. that was the trippy ass
scene. yes!

536
00:37:02.288 --> 00:37:03.289
Yes.

537
00:37:05.657 --> 00:37:07.659
Does a bear in
the woods wipe his

538
00:37:07.659 --> 00:37:09.661
ass with a fluffy white bunn?

539
00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:13.465
I don't know what that means.

540
00:37:14.466 --> 00:37:15.734
That means. yes.

541
00:37:16.335 --> 00:37:20.372
Yes. of course I want the great
Ethan Shaw to teach me. God yes.

542
00:37:22.073 --> 00:37:23.642
Alright. let me see if I

blocking correctly.

with this.

545

Alright. I need you to stand

And I need you a little fur
back. right there.

548
00:37:50.936 --> 00:37:54.406
Hey all. this is Sean.
I would like everyone to meet me

549
00:37:54.406 --> 00:37:57.876
in the living room at 8pm
for tonight's entertainment.

564
00:39:17.423 --> 00:39:19.858
Martha Bischer? Is she relatd
to you?

565
00:39:20.526 --> 00:39:21.993
She's my Gammie.

566
00:39:21.993 --> 00:39:24.863
Whoa. that hot. that woman ws
your grandma?

567
00:39:26.765 --> 00:39:28.934
Yea. she was. she is an actress.

568
00:39:29.535 --> 00:39:31.470
She starred in over 50 films.

569
00:39:31.837 --> 00:39:34.272
This one was always
my favorite though.

570
00:39:34.272 --> 00:39:36.442
This film led to
this very moment.

571
00:39:38.176 --> 00:39:39.978
It all started with Gammie.

572
00:39:41.547 --> 00:39:43.849
I like how at the
end it showed the

573
00:39:43.849 --> 00:39:46.151
shadow instead of
the actual murder.

574
00:39:46.151 --> 00:39:49.020
Yea. see a great director.
Ethan...

575
00:39:50.722 --> 00:39:53.525
Does a great job of showing fear
in action.

576
00:39:55.126 --> 00:39:58.396
See that's the beautiful thig
about horror. It's predicated

577
00:39:58.396 --> 00:40:01.467
on the universal ideology
that we all desire illusion.

578
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:05.070
We have a fundamental need to be
tricked.

579
00:40:06.137 --> 00:40:09.040
It's the trick that makes the
treat sweet.

Nothing. I have to go to

tissue so I came in here.

What I do?

You thought I was in
danger and you came running.

621
00:42:31.983 --> 00:42:33.985
That's more than what
most people would do?

622
00:42:33.985 --> 00:42:36.054
That was nothing. I did that for
anybody.

623
00:42:37.355 --> 00:42:39.157
No. you wouldn't.

624
00:42:40.191 --> 00:42:42.961
I truly believe that you dont
care about anybody else

625
00:42:42.961 --> 00:42:45.697
here. If they were in danger.
you wouldn't bat an eye.

626

If you believe that then ye
got me pegged all wrong.

I don't know how to ask you
this...

676
00:46:08.733 --> 00:46:09.734
Ask me what?

[mischievous music]

678
00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:13.604
I know you're not a thief I

679
00:46:13.604 --> 00:46:15.573
need you to steal
something for me

680
00:46:15.941 --> 00:46:18.376
well actually borrow
because we are gonna

681
00:46:18.376 --> 00:46:21.346
return it but yea first
it's gonna be stealing.

682
00:46:22.047 --> 00:46:23.048
Steal what?

683
00:46:26.184 --> 00:46:28.887
On a desk in Sean's room there's
a script

684
00:46:29.587 --> 00:46:33.424
with the title of the movie that
I'm supposed to be writing.

685
00:46:33.424 --> 00:46:35.961
Wait a minute. I'm confused.
Why are you supposed

686
00:46:35.961 --> 00:46:38.563
to be writing a script if
we already have one?

687
00:46:38.563 --> 00:46:41.799
I don't know. Which is why I
need to read the script.

688
00:46:42.934 --> 00:46:44.769
It's not uncommon for prods

689
00:46:44.769 --> 00:46:46.571
to want a complete
rewrite but...

690
00:46:48.406 --> 00:46:50.375
I haven't been
able to come up with

691
00:46:50.375 --> 00:46:52.377
anything.
so maybe if I could just

692
00:46:52.377 --> 00:46:54.445
see what he already
has and maybe get

693
00:46:54.445 --> 00:46:56.614
an idea of what
he's looking for...

694
00:46:56.614 --> 00:46:57.615
I'll do it.

695
00:46:57.615 --> 00:46:58.616
You will?

696
00:47:00.785 --> 00:47:01.786
Thank you.

697
00:47:03.221 --> 00:47:06.724
I'm not normally a criminal it's
just that this is my big break

698
00:47:06.724 --> 00:47:10.161
and I really don't wanna mess
things up. you know how it i.

699
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:14.832
Not that you messed up
so you should know how

700
00:47:14.832 --> 00:47:17.002
it is but we all mess up.
it's a part of life.

701
00:47:17.335 --> 00:47:20.838
You just happened to do yours
publicly. which is fine...

702
00:47:22.673 --> 00:47:24.175
I should probably stop talkig
now.

703
00:47:24.175 --> 00:47:25.911
Yea. you probably should.

704
00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:32.984
The truth is I wasn't readr
the fame and what came witt

705
00:47:33.484 --> 00:47:35.820
and I made the mistake
any 19 year old would

have and I just did it
publicly like you said.

707
00:47:38.789 --> 00:47:40.658
Well if you ask me. I think

708
00:47:40.658 --> 00:47:42.994
you're about due
for a come back.

709
00:47:43.828 --> 00:47:44.829
I hope so.

710
00:47:46.797 --> 00:47:49.800
Now look. if I'm gonna
steal this for you we need

711
00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:52.703
to do it later and I'm
gonna need a diversion.

712
00:47:55.606 --> 00:47:56.807
[ominous music]

713
00:48:17.963 --> 00:48:18.696
Ethan.

714
00:48:18.696 --> 00:48:19.397
Hey.

715
00:48:19.397 --> 00:48:20.698
How can I help you?

716
00:48:20.698 --> 00:48:22.800
Wanted to know if we couldk
horror movies.

717
00:48:23.801 --> 00:48:25.903
My favorite subject. come on in.

718
00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:30.041
Please.

719
00:48:34.745 --> 00:48:35.746
Talk to me.

720
00:48:36.214 --> 00:48:39.250
Alright well you spoke
about the different rules

721
00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:42.320
and disciplines that
every horror film follows...

722
00:48:43.221 --> 00:48:46.257
and since we're making thet
horror film ever...

723
00:48:47.825 --> 00:48:50.028
I wanted to know...
what rules do you

724
00:48:50.028 --> 00:48:52.197
think that this
film should follow.

725
00:48:52.597 --> 00:48:55.700
Ok. well to me there
are five essential

726
00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:58.836
elements to every
great horror movie.

727
00:48:59.937 --> 00:49:02.073
One. fear.

728
00:49:03.774 --> 00:49:05.743
Two. a shower scene.

729
00:49:07.712 --> 00:49:10.748
Three. unsuspecting victims.

730
00:49:12.683 --> 00:49:15.886
Four. a great big house.

731
00:49:17.422 --> 00:49:18.356
And five...

732
00:49:18.356 --> 00:49:19.357
[knocking]

733
00:49:20.958 --> 00:49:23.728
Seems my room is the popular
room tonight. excuse me.

734
00:49:28.866 --> 00:49:29.967
Hey.

735
00:49:29.967 --> 00:49:32.237
Can I talk to you for a se?

736
00:49:32.237 --> 00:49:33.238
Yea.

737
00:49:34.572 --> 00:49:36.107
I'll be right back.

738
00:49:39.577 --> 00:49:40.778
[ominous music]

739
00:49:53.791 --> 00:49:55.126
Sorry about that.

740
00:49:59.297 --> 00:50:00.131
Where were we?

741
00:50:00.131 --> 00:50:01.066
Number 5?

742
00:50:01.066 --> 00:50:02.067
Right. 5.

743
00:50:03.101 --> 00:50:05.236
A twist. you gotta have a twist.

744
00:50:06.437 --> 00:50:08.239
See horror movies are tricky.
you

745
00:50:08.239 --> 00:50:10.341
can't just kill people
for 90 minutes.

746
00:50:11.142 --> 00:50:13.911
So there's a lot of fluff.
but if you can

747
00:50:13.911 --> 00:50:16.681
make the fluff mean
something at the end...

748
00:50:18.083 --> 00:50:19.517
you got a jackpot.

749
00:50:19.517 --> 00:50:22.253
What would be a good twist fr
this movie?

750
00:50:22.853 --> 00:50:24.689
You gotta establish
these elements in

751
00:50:24.689 --> 00:50:26.957
order. So first you
have to establish fear.

752
00:50:28.826 --> 00:50:29.994
And how do we do that?

753
00:50:29.994 --> 00:50:33.030
You're the director. Ethan. I'll
leave that to you.

754
00:50:35.633 --> 00:50:38.669
I'm gonna leave you with tha.
Ethan. Tomorrow is just a

755
00:50:38.669 --> 00:50:42.039
killer of a day and I need to
get some rest. You should to.

Come in.

760
00:51:14.205 --> 00:51:15.706
What you got there?

761

I'm just journaling.

763
00:51:21.746 --> 00:51:23.748
Does anything but that for m.

764
00:51:24.649 --> 00:51:26.884
The thought of my
innermost feelings

765
00:51:26.884 --> 00:51:28.819
conveyed on a sheet of paper.

766
00:51:29.187 --> 00:51:30.188
in a book.

767
00:51:32.157 --> 00:51:33.824
It makes me feel exposed.

768
00:51:36.026 --> 00:51:38.563
All the reason why you should
have one.

769
00:51:40.198 --> 00:51:41.499
It helps. Ethan.

770
00:51:43.501 --> 00:51:45.903
You know when I was a kid.

771
00:51:47.572 --> 00:51:50.275
My parents had a lot of
arguments.

772
00:51:52.410 --> 00:51:54.279
I can remember so many times.

773
00:51:54.279 --> 00:51:56.681
standing on the
top of the staircase.

774
00:51:56.681 --> 00:52:00.418
just screaming at them. "Just
stop it you're scaring me!"

775
00:52:04.121 --> 00:52:07.525
After that they just continud
in a more hushed voice.

776
00:52:09.627 --> 00:52:13.698
To this day I wonder if
whispers...

777
00:52:14.432 --> 00:52:17.034
have more power and depth whn
we speak?

778
00:52:18.636 --> 00:52:22.473
If yelling is the unravelif
a marriage then...

779
00:52:23.241 --> 00:52:27.445
whispers must be the war of
total destruction.

780
00:52:29.414 --> 00:52:30.415
Anyway.

781
00:52:31.616 --> 00:52:34.419
I would take my journal
and hide under the

782
00:52:34.419 --> 00:52:37.154
covers with a flashlight
and I would write.

783
00:52:38.055 --> 00:52:41.058
That was just my way of makig
everything right.

784
00:52:45.996 --> 00:52:48.766
Well. I have a gift for you.

Academy for recognizing

831
00:55:27.057 --> 00:55:28.993
me in my role in Call Time...
I mean when I

832
00:55:28.993 --> 00:55:30.995
first got on the set I
thought it wasn't gonna

833
00:55:30.995 --> 00:55:33.598
happen either. I mean the
whole filming and the movie

834
00:55:33.598 --> 00:55:38.235
but obviously it did because I'm
getting this award. biotch.

1012

They said I was crazy.
they said I went mad...

and they were right. only not in
the sense that I lost my mind.

In the sense that I got angr.

keep going no matter what.

And how does this make you nt
crazy?

If you do something over
and over and over again you

1021

eventually get it right.
It doesn't matter if you

1022
01:07:21.271 --> 01:07:24.007
were doing it wrong or
doing it right. if you do it

comes that you do it right.

01:09:35.305 --> 01:09:38.908
and the one thing that you al
have in common is family.

1061
01:09:39.643 --> 01:09:42.679
Everyone here has little to o
family.

1062
01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:45.148
Or you're estranged.

1063
01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:48.685
You also have some film talet
but not too much.

1064
01:09:50.287 --> 01:09:53.957
So I go to small town indie film
fests!

1065
01:09:55.292 --> 01:09:57.994
And by the way you
were completely robbed on

1066
01:09:57.994 --> 01:10:00.630
your best director
but I took care of that...

1067
01:10:02.599 --> 01:10:04.200
What'd you do to him?

1068
01:10:08.672 --> 01:10:11.341
There are two ways out of .
Ethan...

1069
01:10:11.341 --> 01:10:13.943
and I know that right
now you're already

1070
01:10:13.943 --> 01:10:16.513
thinking.
maybe death isn't all that!

1071
01:10:16.513 --> 01:10:19.182
No more broken relationships.
no more arguments over

1072
01:10:19.182 --> 01:10:21.685
money. no more custody bat.
no more regrets.

1073
01:10:22.852 --> 01:10:30.026
Or join me. Ethan. and direc.

1074
01:10:30.694 --> 01:10:33.196
Direct these people
to their deaths. it's

1075
01:10:33.196 --> 01:10:35.532
your chance to
make everything right

1076
01:10:36.633 --> 01:10:40.504
and it's your chance to bee
man that you're supposed t.

1077
01:10:41.405 --> 01:10:42.706
How old is Ally?

1078
01:10:44.574 --> 01:10:47.544
She's... she's like 8. 8.

1079
01:10:47.544 --> 01:10:49.646
Yea. that's not too late.

1080
01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:54.318
It's not too late for her to see
her daddy as a hero

1081
01:10:54.818 --> 01:10:56.219
and not a villain.

1082
01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:03.527
[phone ringing]

1083
01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:21.611

I don't have time to explain
this but Sean...

1088
01:12:26.843 --> 01:12:29.846
he locked me in this room
and right now him and Niko

1089
01:12:29.846 --> 01:12:32.749
are on their way to kill
every single one of you.

1090
01:12:33.517 --> 01:12:35.619
You guys are in the attic.

1091
01:12:35.619 --> 01:12:37.454
Of course. he knows
we're in the attic. this

1092
01:12:37.454 --> 01:12:39.188
is where we always hang out.
Come on guys.

1093
01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:43.793
Yo if he's watching then wath

What a cry baby. Yo. you're a

1095
01:12:50.133 --> 01:12:53.169
Derek there's really no
time for middle fingers

1096
01:12:53.169 --> 01:12:55.839
since Niko's on her
way to chop 'em off.

1097
01:12:58.207 --> 01:13:00.143
Yo. so what should we do?

1098
01:13:00.777 --> 01:13:02.145
You need to get out.

1099
01:13:02.145 --> 01:13:04.213
You ain't got to tell me t.

1100
01:13:08.284 --> 01:13:09.285
[Derek]
Shit.

1101
01:13:09.953 --> 01:13:10.987
[tense music]

1102
01:13:15.291 --> 01:13:16.292
Oh shit.

[Tasha]

[knocking. shushing]

1105
01:13:32.542 --> 01:13:34.210
Grab the walkie talkie.

1106
01:13:34.678 --> 01:13:35.679
[knocking]

1107

Walkie check.

1110
01:13:52.095 --> 01:13:53.096
Good. check.

1111
01:13:56.566 --> 01:13:59.836
You need to get out of there
now. Go to the other side

1112
01:13:59.836 --> 01:14:03.072
of the attic. there's a
stairway. leads to a back .

1113
01:14:03.439 --> 01:14:05.108
That'll take you outside.

1114
01:14:11.114 --> 01:14:12.782
[tense ominous music]

1115
01:14:19.589 --> 01:14:21.725
[Philip]
Let's go. Come on.

1116
01:14:23.026 --> 01:14:24.393
This can't be happening.

1117
01:14:24.393 --> 01:14:27.463
Yo fuck this shit yo.

Look. look. nobodies gonna die.

1120
01:14:34.571 --> 01:14:39.142
Look... we can make it out alive
if we stick together. Ok all?

1121
01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:41.410
He's right. he's right.

1122
01:14:41.410 --> 01:14:43.112
What are we gonna do?

1123
01:14:45.248 --> 01:14:46.282
Take the van.

1124
01:14:47.216 --> 01:14:48.752
[Philip]
So come on with me.

1125
01:14:49.619 --> 01:14:51.287
[tense dramatic music]

1126
01:15:03.466 --> 01:15:04.734
Check the visor.

1127
01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:11.240
Yo. why don't we just sit hee
and wait for help. Yo?

1128
01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:13.442
And be trapped like sitting
ducks? No.

1129
01:15:13.442 --> 01:15:14.911
We could just run.

1130
01:15:15.144 --> 01:15:17.313
No. the van is our best bet. ok?

1131
01:15:18.347 --> 01:15:19.348
Shit.

1132
01:15:19.949 --> 01:15:23.587
I saw a rack of keys hangiy

the front door and grab the key.

1145
01:15:54.450 --> 01:15:56.219

I can't just sit here anymor.

1186
01:20:39.502 --> 01:20:41.570
Derek and Lia
probably need our help.

1187

No. we need to stay here.

1188
01:20:45.909 --> 01:20:47.176
They'll be back.

1189
01:20:48.744 --> 01:20:51.414
I don't know. It's been a minute
since they left.

1190
01:20:52.348 --> 01:20:54.117
If they was coming
back they probably

1191
01:20:54.117 --> 01:20:55.584
would have came back already.

1192
01:20:56.352 --> 01:20:58.922
Yea. which means they're
probably dead.

1193
01:21:02.658 --> 01:21:04.928
I mean we don't know that for
sure.

1194
01:21:06.195 --> 01:21:08.932
What do you mean we don't
know that for sure? You just

1195
01:21:08.932 --> 01:21:11.634
said. if they was coming
back they'd be back already.

1196
01:21:14.103 --> 01:21:15.771
