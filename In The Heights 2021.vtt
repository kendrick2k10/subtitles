Don't let life slide

156
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Chokin' on the heat

159
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000

We came to work
and to live

168
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000

-Yeah. so how was the DR?

189

I got to visit
some old friends.

I wish I could go back more
often.

191

192
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
-Hey. so you get to check out
my dad's old place?

193
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Same story as last time?

194
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
You ready?

195
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
-Don't play!
-

196
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Now. it's probably not how you
remember it.

197
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
but it could be an opportunity
to bring it back to life.

198
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
My pops would be rolling in his
grave if he saw what came

199
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
The electricity's shot.

200
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Half the roof got taken in the
hurricane.

201
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Thus the low asking price.
the quick sale.

202
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
"El Sueñito."

203
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Pop's little dream.

204
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Yo. I remember. man. when--

205
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
I used to be working
in the back

206
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And I was like John Wick.
I'd be like...

207
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
-

208
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
I've been saving up all my
pennies in my piggy bank for

209
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Yeah. on these blocks.
you can't walk two steps

210
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
without bumping into someone's
big plans.

211
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Mijo...

212
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Okay. I'm in.

213
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Thank you. man.

214
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
I'll see you.  papa.

215
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
- Come on.

216
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
This is crazy!

217
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Let's go!

218
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Mine was a... quaint little
sueñito.

219
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
If I made it back to the
Dominican Republic. then we

220
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
But Nina Rosario's dreams were
all about reach.

221
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Spelling bee champ.
valedictorian.

222
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
managed her dad's business
and basically...

223
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
she was like a little sister
to me.

224
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Girl was a rocket. determined
to go far.

225
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
What?

226
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
The genius is back!

227
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
-I missed you!
-Me. too. Did you just get in?

228
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Yeah. late last night.

229
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
-Final week?
-Yeah. it's really happening.

230
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Yo. so much to catch up on.

231
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
-Come over for a free
mani-pedi. yeah?

232
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Mm-hm. Oh. and Benny's on the
dispatch today. Just sayin'.

233
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000

if you want it

237
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
West Side

238
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
left side

239
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
slide

240
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
If you catch the lights

241
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
weekend

242
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
take Route 87

243
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
back in again

244
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
-

245
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
-

246
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
-

247
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
-

248
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
dispatch. right?

249
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
check the technique

250
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
traffic accident

251
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Ave and the Jacob Javitz

252
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
don't get stuck in

253
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
wreck

254
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
special guest

255
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Live and direct from a year
out west

256
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Welcome her back. 'cause she
looks mad stressed!

257
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
the barrio's best

258
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
-

259
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
-No. no. no. no...
-Go. go. go.

260
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:25.000
-Whoo!
-

261
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
welcome wagon

262
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
You thirsty as hell.

263
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Ohh!
You used to date?

264
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
No way.
the boss's daughter?

265
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Nina Rosario!

266
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
-Oh! Yo!
-What's up?

267
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
-Yo. hold up.

268
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Don't get hit by a car. girl.
you just got here.

269
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Oh. man.

270
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Yo. mad changes
happening on the block since

271
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Oh. yeah. I mean.
at least your dad

272
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Yo. the cleaners next door.
nine dollars a shirt.

273
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
-What?
-Yo! Look who's home!

274
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Look at you!
Why are you taller than me?

275
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
I know. my man grew a couple
inches. he think he a man.

276
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Man. shut up.
-I see you.

277
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Listen. you down to march next
week?

278
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Like we used to?

279
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
What's the cause?

280
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
They're talking about kicking
out all the DREAMers.

281
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
It's time to make some noise.
You want to come?

282
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
I know that voice!

283
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Count me in.
-Yo. Later.

284
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
-Well. you do good? You done?
-Yeah.

285
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
-My man. who's watching the
store?

286
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
-Yo!
-Shit!

287
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Pete! You can't just take that!

288
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Bro! Get back here. man!

289
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
That's on your tab. bro!
Both of y'all.

290
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Oh. yes.

291
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Hand-embroidered
by your mother.

292
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
May she rest in peace.

293
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
We'll use them for the party.

294
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
They're beautiful.

295
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Abuela Claudia never had kids.

296
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
so she adopted the whole
block as her own.

297
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Adopted our  sueñitos  . too.

298
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
When I got to Stanford...

299
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
...the isolation. Abuela.

300
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
The loneliness.

301
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
I was. like. "What am I doing
here?"

302
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Mira  . when
my  mamá  came from Cuba...

303
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Ay.  Dios mío.

304
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000
She felt like one tiny grain of
sand from the beaches we left

305
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
What did she do?

306
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
She bought a winter coat
and a pair of velvet gloves.

307
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Her hands were cracked
from the cleaning fluids.

308
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
But the gloves hid that.

309
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
We had to assert our dignity in
small ways.

310
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
That's why these napkins are
beautiful.

311
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000
That's why my mother's gloves
were beautiful.

312
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Little details that tell the
world. we are not invisible.

313
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.000
-

314
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
-Hey. Nina.  Como estás?

315
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
"You're going places"

316
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000
that while I was away

317
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
-Hey. Nina!

318
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
you know

319
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
real slow

320
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
-

321
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Sigué andando
el camino por

322
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
-

323
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
que Dios te bendiga

324
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
-

325
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
city was mine

326
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
-

327
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
and said

328
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
"Nina. be brave and you're
gonna be fine"

329
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
But it all seems like
lifetimes ago

330
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000
to these faces

331
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
-

332
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
about me

333
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
nuestra estrella

334
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
to succeed

335
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000
who made it out!

336
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
grade

337
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
But maybe I should have
just stayed home

338
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
wide awake

339
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
the highest place

340
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
-

341
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
-

342
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
lots of papers

343
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
oh. God

344
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
-

345
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
-

346
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000
letting you down

347
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Nina!

348
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
The reality of an elite
school...

349
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
it's no joke. Pop.

350
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
Yeah. when I left. y'all were.
like.

351
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
"It's gonna be great. Go show
'em who we are. Go represent."

352
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
The truth is...

353
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000
is that most of the time I'm
at Stanford feels like a

354
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
De verdad?  Of who?

355
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000
Of my family.

356
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000
My community.

357
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000
Like the dean. he invited me
to this diversity dinner.

358
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Super-wealthy donors. trustees.
the whole nine.

359
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
And I wore this black cocktail
dress and I was walking to my

360
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000
and one of the patrons shoved
her plate into my arms

361
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000
and said. "I ordered the
vegetarian option."

362
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
-No.
-Yeah.

363
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000
And all the servers.
all Latino.

364
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
like. "Ooh. what's this
trigueña  gonna do?"

365
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
"Ooh. what's she gon' do?
Is she with us?

366
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000
Ah. bueno.  There's no
shame in waiting tables.

367
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
And there's no shame
in having a different path.

368
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000
Like you.

369
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Dad... the deadline passed.

370
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
The extension
on spring tuition.

371
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Yeah.
-But I didn't receive notice.

372
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Yeah. they let me finish off my
classes. but we owe them.

373
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000
No. don't you give it a second
thought. I'm on it. Hm?

374
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Dad...

375
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000
The deadline to pay and enroll
for next semester also passed.

376
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
How come you know
about all this

377
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000
I switched the info.
I gave the finance office

378
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Well. why would you do that?

379
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Because you sold half the
business. and it barely covered

380
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000
I don't want you doing
something

381
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
-  Espera  . that sale pulled
us out of debt.

382
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
You and I both know that
finances were tenuous before

383
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000
And this might not be feasible.

384
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
-I'm gonna call them right now.
-Dad. Stanford's over.

385
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Stop overreacting.
Nina. please.

386
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000
-Dad. I'm serious.
-Oye!

387
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000
You don't tell me how much we
can afford.

388
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000
You're not the parent. Hm?

389
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
God bless you.  Dios te bendiga.

390
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Gracias!

391
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
What's all over those pipes?

392
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
-Rust.
-Rust?

393
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000
Lovely.

394
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
- That's the roof.

395
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000
On the floor?

396
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Ay. Usnavi.

397
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Tu eres un  workaholic.

398
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
You think it will be different
in the Dominican Republic?

399
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
Just like my  mamá.

400
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Morning and night. year after
year... to what end?

401
00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
To wake up and scrub another
floor till the day she died.

402
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Yeah. but... here I work to
survive.

403
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
El Sueñito  will be a
labor of love.

404
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
The  bodega  was only supposed
to be temporary.

405
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
but now... I'm like. almost 30.

406
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
The plan was always to go back.

407
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Hopefully. I won't be going
alone.

408
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
You. me and Sonny?

409
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Y Sonny?  Is he on board?

410
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
He's my next ask.

411
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000
I'm not going without him.

412
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Look. I got Sonny.

413
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000
You know I can't go nowhere
without you.

414
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
I took care of my community.
no?

415
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000
-Hell. yes!
-

416
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000
El Sueñito  2.0.

417
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000
The tropical air'll keep you
young. girl!

418
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000
Caramba  . buy me a bikini!

419
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000
Let's go!

420
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000
I don't know. man.
Leave Washington Heights?

421
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
I'd have to talk to my dad...

422
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
You're just a kid.

423
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
You don't even know. For real.

424
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Dominican Republic's gonna blow
your mind.

425
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
Look...

426
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000
You do you. It's all good. But
don't be roping me into your

427
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000
Beach.

428
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
Merengue  .  Carnaval.

429
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Summer all year 'round.

430
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Who's gonna greet you in DR?

431
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Some cousin you saw two
Christmases ago?

432
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000
Best days of my life
were there.

433
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
That's the corniest thing I've
ever heard.

434
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
You came here when you was
eight.

435
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
You got... "island memories."

436
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
Not me. I was in Pampers
on that plane.

437
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
NYC's my spot.

438
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
I got my island. okay?
Go get yours.

439
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000
Don't forget how you got your
name.

440
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000
-Yo...
-Just. fix the fridge.

441
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000
Yeah. all right.
Bro. you think you're funny?

442
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
What's "Usnavi" mean. anyway?

443
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000
That sounds weird.

444
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000
No. it doesn't.

445
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
-All right. All right. all
right. all right.

446
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000
On my dad's first trip to
Nueva York...

447
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
he saw a passing ship on
the horizon.

448
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:26.000
And... he was. like. "Wow.
that's gonna be

449
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000
-Usnavi!
- Ohh...

450
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Usnavi...

451
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
I like it.

452
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000
Thank you.

453
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Hi. Mr. Rosario?
-Yes. yes. I'm here.

454
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000
Yes. I'm not sure the
information you received

455
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.000
In actuality. we're still
accepting tuition

456
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
So the deadline hasn't passed?

457
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000
No. it has not passed.
Would you like to know the

458
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Yes. I have a pencil.

459
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000
Sure. the balance that's due
for the fall semester...

460
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000
Now. remember.
the block was

461
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
Exhibit A: Daniela's salon.

462
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000
Moving in a week. after
decades of makeovers.

463
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000
the skin-deep kind
and the emotional kind.

464
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000
No one could fill her shoes.

465
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Literally. they were like
four inches high.

466
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000
He doesn't have an apartment.
He doesn't pay rent anywhere.

467
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
He's bouncing between
two girls' houses.

468
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000
-Of course he is.
-Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

469
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000
You know what?
It's mad we allow

470
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
-We need to have a better
standard.

471
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Tres paradas...
pickety. packety. poom.

472
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
-.and you're at the new spot.
-

473
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
I'm too old.
and the Bronx is

474
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000
Que voy a hacer?
I was priced out.

475
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Most of my clients already up
and moved to the Grand

476
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000
Hey. built in customers.

477
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000
My lunch break
isn't long enough

478
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Jessica...

479
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
One: swipe the fare card.

480
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
Two: ride three stops.

481
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000
Three: arrive at my new
location.

482
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000
Ten minutes max.

483
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000
Ten minutes?  Cariño.

484
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
What are you riding. a time
machine?

485
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
Excuse me?

486
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000
No. she didn't. right?

487
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
-Our people survived
slave ships.

488
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
-We survived  Taino  genocide.
-

489
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
-We survived  conquistadores
and dictators.

490
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
You're telling me we can't
survive the D Train to the

491
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
- Okay. okay. okay.

492
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
And who cuts your hair better
than me?

493
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000
-Hello. hello...

494
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000
For you.  mamita  . front of
the line!  Oye!

495
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000
-Emergency. coming through!
-

496
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
Mira. Nina!

497
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
-

498
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000
I don't know

499
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
-

500
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
-

501
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000
-

502
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.000
heard around the barrio

503
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000
I don't know

504
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000
You didn't hear this from me

505
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000
little birdie told me

506
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000
skank like that

507
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000
Please tell me
you're joking

508
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
say

509
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000
I don't know

510
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000
-What? I don't care!

511
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000
talking to Benny

512
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000
-

513
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
big... taxi!

514
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
-

515
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000
heard all that

516
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000
mean

517
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000
limousine

518
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000
I don't know

519
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
Oh. God.

520
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000
you'd be

521
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000
all out west

522
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000
You were always the best.
no doubt

523
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000
your graduation

524
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000
-

525
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000
You guys!

526
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000
I... dropped out.

527
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000
No me diga.

528
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000
Yeah. I should go.

529
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
-Well. that's a shitty

530
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000
She probably flunked out.

531
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000
Or she got a little bun in the
oven. you know?

532
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
What the hell happened?

533
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000
I don't know

534
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
Dani. I'm taking lunch.

535
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000
Go get me a soda. please?

536
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
Yeah.
-Where's she sneaking off to?

537
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000
That was real quick.

538
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000
Okay. so we're gonna shave the
whole thing.

539
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Vanessa.

540
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
-Vanessa!
-

541
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000
Vanessa.
tough as nails.

542
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000
Dreamed of being a downtown
fashion designer.

543
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
To her. a  sueñito  was something
you keep a secret.

544
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:20.000
by my window

545
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
Don't disrupt my dreams

546
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
everyone insane

547
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
They can't tolerate the noise

548
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000
'Cuz I never let them stay

549
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000
I'm hoppin' that

557
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
It will not be with some dude

558
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000
'Cuz he has nothing to say

559
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000
Chevrolet

560
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000
I'm hoppin' in a limousine

561
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000
I'm sorry.
Had to rush to get

562
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000
I e-mailed you a few days ago.
but I brought an extra copy.

563
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000
Here. just in case.
Sorry. here.

564
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Ah. Miss Morales.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
-Yeah-- yes.
-Right.

566
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000
I'm sorry. honey. I meant to
call you.

567
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000
Oh... Uh. I got bank checks.

568
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000
First month. last month and
security. Good as cash.

569
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.000
It's just without a solid
credit check. there's not much

570
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000
Maybe your parents could
co-sign.

571
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000
Assuming they can prove income
40 times the rent.

572
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000
You know what? Get it to me by
five. I'll see what I can do.

573
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000
-Hi!

574
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Yo. how'd it go?

580
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.000
Are we popping champagne?

581
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000
The realtor took one look at
this. and was. like... "No."

582
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000
Well. nope on her.

583
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000
There's something
on your shirt.

584
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000
Just this.

585
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000
My cousin over there.

586
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000

Yeah?

590
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Does your cousin dance?

591
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000
Like a drunk Chita Rivera.

592
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000
Stop.

593
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:51.000

733
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000
hypotheticals

734
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000
from the wheel

735
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000
-

736
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000
-

737
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.000
-

738
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000
-

739
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000
-

740
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000
-

741
00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.000
And no breakin' your neck
for respect...

742
00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.000
-

743
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000
-

744
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000
-

745
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000
Take it easy

746
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.000
-

747
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000
-

748
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:24.000
-

749
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.000
-

750
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000
We could tell
everyone we know

751
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.000
and go

752
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000
We'll get the dough and

753
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000
We're never gonna

754
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000
We'll get the dough and

755
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.000
We're never gonna

756
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.000
-

757
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000
-

758
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000
-We got the numbers. let's go!

759
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.000
-Five!
-

760
00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000
-Seven!
-

761
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000
-Sixteen!
-

762
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000
-Twenty-six!
-

763
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000
-

764
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000
We're never gonna

765
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000
-Thirty-three!

766
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000
-Nobody?
-You put in ten dollars?

767
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.000
Oh. shit. This is the one.

768
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000
Oh. man.

769
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000
This is it! This is it!

770
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.000
So who won?

771
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000
That's what everyone was
wondering.

772
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000
But the ticket was never turned
in.

773
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.000
What? Now you talking crazy.
boy.

774
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.000
-Yo. you lying. Tell us. man.
-Yeah. tell us.

775
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000
If I knew. I would.
The point is not who won...

776
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.000
but that we all had a  sueñito.

777
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.000
And when it comes to dreams...
we had to keep scraping by.

778
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000
tengo de parcha

779
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.000

780
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:50.000
shut me down

781
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:57.000
can say

782
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:06.000
-You hit my truck?
-

783
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:09.000
-Get out of here!
This is my block.

784
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.000
scraping by

785
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:17.000
Lai. lo. le. lo. lai!

786
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000
keep scraping by

787
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:27.000
Keep scraping by

788
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.000
que calor

789
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.000
Punk!

790
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.000
Stitchwork like this doesn't
exist anymore.

791
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000
Mm-hm.

792
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000
Handmade by an old friend.

793
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000
How much will you take for 'em?

794
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:54.000
Oh. no. no. Not for sale.

795
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:57.000
They're for a special occasion
this weekend.

796
00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.000
-Does tomorrow by 4:00 work?
-Oh. perfect!

797
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:05.000
-  Gracias.
-All right.

798
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000
Plus tax. I'll waive the rush
fee.

799
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000
Cash or credit?

800
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.000
Bueno.

801
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:17.000
-Let me think about it.
-Of course.

802
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000
Welcome to the block.

803
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.000
Admit it.

804
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.000
You're happy
I didn't make it at

805
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.000
I mean. Nina.
I'm not gonna lie.

806
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.000
This feels great.

807
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:42.000
Girl gets into NYU. she gets
into Columbia...

808
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.000
-but she had to go to the
farthest place.

809
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000
Nina. I'm not gonna be a ball
and chain.

810
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000
Right. I told you--
We talked ab--

811
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.000
-Here we go.
-What do you mean.

812
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.000
Shh. Let me just listen to my
block.

813
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.000
-

814
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:19.000
top of the world

815
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:23.000
a subway map

816
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:33.000
to my place

817
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.000
Right.

818
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:49.000
in the sky

819
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:54.000
subway map

820
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000
Oh. no.

821
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:28.000
At my corner fire hydrant

822
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:33.000
every summer

823
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000
Till my face got drenched

824
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000
-Yep.

825
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000
-

826
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:43.000
-

827
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:44.000
dispatch window

828
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.000
They're coming to get me!"

829
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:51.000
trouble

830
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000
No. I wasn't.

831
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000
snide But he'd let me

832
00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:03.000
When you're home

833
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:07.000
When you're home

834
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:13.000
seems clearer

835
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:17.000
it me?

836
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.000
I wanna show you all I know

837
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000
And the light is getting low

838
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.000
to Castle Garden?

839
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:32.000
take a shot When the day

840
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.000
A little ways away

841
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000
-

842
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.000
-

843
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.000
it darkened You'd hang

844
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:48.000
would bring his radio

845
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.000
from Senior Studies

846
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.000
buddies

847
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000
-

848
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.000
-Get in here. girl!
-No...

849
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000
Come on!

850
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:14.000
No paré! Sigué. sigué!

851
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.000
No paré! Sigué!

852
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:24.000
When you're home

853
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:27.000
here with me

854
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:30.000
you are hearing

855
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:33.000
cheering you along

856
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000
-

857
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:41.000
I'd imagine what would happen

858
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:45.000
Puerto Rico

859
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:50.000
If I had never seen Manhattan

860
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.000
with my people

861
00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:00.000
I've tried to find the answer

862
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000
learning Spanish

863
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:10.000
answer out at

864
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:13.000
at the sea

865
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:17.000
to be?

866
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000
proud of me

867
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:36.000
you all day

868
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:41.000
That may be how

869
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:48.000
That when you find your way

870
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:53.000
world and then We're all

871
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000
-

872
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:08.000
-

873
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:11.000
-

874
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:16.000
-

875
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.000
I'm home.

876
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.000
Hey. boss. I got your caffeine.

877
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000
I'm in a meeting.

878
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.000
Oh. hey. Pike.

879
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.000
Everything okay?

880
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.000
Thank you. Benny.
Thank you very much.

881
00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:59.000
-Need anything else?
-No. no. We're good.

882
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:00.000
If you need--

883
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Café con leche.

884
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Number twelve...

885
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
It's better
than his current

886
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
I can pay for his flights. to
and from.

887
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Christmas. summers...

888
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Just so that he doesn't go too
long without seeing you.

889
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
And. you know. I know
you're his dad.

890
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000
and I'm just his big cousin.
but...

891
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000
I mean...
this could be good for

892
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
You're unsure.

893
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Talk to me.

894
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Chill out. You're hovering.

895
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
You're doing that thing. you
should...

896
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000
That's your first of the day?

897
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Listen. if I could be like...

898
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
"Out you go. Sonny." I would.

899
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
I thought about it.

900
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
But. I can't.

901
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
The kid doesn't listen
to shit I

902
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.000
-So is that a yes?
-Is it a yes?

903
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Tio  ... Come on. man.

904
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.000
He's a good kid.
He's smart. He's funny.

905
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
He cares.

906
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000
That kid does well in school.
he works hard.

907
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
And I could tell you.

908
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000
I'm with him every day.
Working in my store.

909
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
I got that kid working to the
bone. but look. I'm...

910
01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000
He has an opportunity to have a
life that you and me didn't

911
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Come on.  Tio.

912
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
How do you pay him?

913
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Cash.

914
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Ever wonder why?

915
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Ever?

916
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000
-Perdón. Alejandro.
-Hey.

917
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Thank you for letting me
come in

918
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:45.000
I was just wondering
about the status

919
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
We got good news.  mijo.

920
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000
The check is cashed.

921
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
So
there's no chance.

922
01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.000
just to tie up some loose ends

Let me get you a drink.

963
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
-Think fast.

964
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
All right. let's clean this up
before Abuela gets here.

-No. not this song again!

967
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000
That scratch on the record is
her favorite part.

968
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000
-The scratch on the record
is my favorite part.

969
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Wow.

970
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
You don't want any
of it? Oh. yeah. you're trying

971
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Let me give you
a vegan  pastel.

972
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Nina!
You got sauce on my sleeve!

973
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Tsk.
Pass me a tissue or something.

974
01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
No. I got you.

975
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
-You're good.
-Wow.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

977
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000
-Mirenlo.
-Now you know.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
-Be generous.
-Yeah. we're gonna get it out.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000
-Wow.
-You know what I'm sayin'.

980
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Nice.

981
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
I take note.

982
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
You know.
my first business.

983
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000
You know what?
Every time you tell the story.

984
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
you're a different age. and you
get younger

985
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
-and younger and younger.
-I was seven or eight...

986
01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
I took a rag and a coffee can.

987
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.000
I went to the  plaza  in Arecibo
to shine shoes for a nickel.

988
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
But every nickel went to shoe
polish. right?

989
01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Because the next time I could
charge a dime.

990
01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000
-Wow. my man was a hustler.
-'Cause you got that investment

991
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
-Hey. Benny!
-Hey. yo!

992
01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
-The party's just starting.
siéntate.

993
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000
-Let me make you a plate.
-No. no. I'm not hungry.

994
01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Benny. not hungry?

995
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Yo. Kevin. that
meeting I walked in on with you

996
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Is that what I thought it was?

997
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
'Cause. you know.
I keep playing

998
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Adios.  I was saving that
news for dessert.

999
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
What news?

1000
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:21.000
You know. when Pike originally
approached me. he wanted the

1001
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000
So today. I reopened the
conversation.

1002
01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
What?
-I knew it.

1003
01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
I guess we're gonna
do this now.

1004
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Nina... it was about your age

1005
01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000
that your mother and I.
God rest her soul. we came here

1006
01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000
and we emptied our savings to
put a down payment

1007
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Two burgundy Cadillacs.
that was

1008
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Start small. dream big.

1009
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
I look at you.  mija.
I see her.

1010

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000
I sold Rosario's.

1013
01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000
-  Felicidades!
-What?

1014
01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
-Raise a glass.
-  Felicidades!

1015
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.000
- Yes.

1016
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000
To Nina. who can now finish
what she started at Stanford.

1017
01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000
To Nina!

1018
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
-To Nina.

Nina. say. "Thank you.  Papi."

1020
01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Dad... the deadline passed.

1021
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
-I don't know what you're
talking about.

1022
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Stop with the lying. I called
them.

1023
01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000
I called them!
Stop trying to protect me here.

1024
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
There were other things other
than the finances.

1025
01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Did you not hear what I said?

1026
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Yes. about the ignorant
idiotas  --

1027
01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
That's the same thing that
we foresaw when we came!

1028
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
-No. it's not the same thing.
Dad.

1029
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
It is not
the same.

1030
01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000
When you came here and Mom came
here. you all had a Latino

1031
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000
ready to welcome you.
open arms.

1032
01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
and teachers and lawyers.
first generation.

1033
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
There's no community for me at
school.

1034
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000
I got searched.

1035
01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Yeah.

1036
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000
I got searched.

1037
01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
On moving day...

1038
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.000
my roommate lost
her pearl necklace and...

1039
01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.000
the RA and her parents
came in...

1040
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000
and searched me and they...

1041
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.000
emptied my drawers.
turned over my purse...

1042
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
and I just stood there.

1043
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.000
I stood there
and didn't say anything.

1044
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
And then eventually.
they found it... in her bag.

1045
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
You're the best
we've got. Nina.

1046
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
If you can't stay in the ring.
what's that gonna say about us?

1047
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
You can't keep
putting your life's work

1048
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Dile. mi gente.
isn't she the best we got?

1049
01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
And then I apologize
like an idiot.

1050
01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
I stood there.
I didn't do anything.

1051
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
and then I apologized.

1052
01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Well. you keep
getting A's. baby.

1053
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
that's your revenge.

1054
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
-My God. you're not
hearing her. Kevin.

1055
01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000
-Como?
-I'm not going back!

1056
01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000
So all of my decisions
can just go to hell here?

1057
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000
-I'm doing this for you!
-No. you're doing it for you!

1058
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
What if I refuse your money?

1059
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
What if I don't want it?

1060
01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
I refuse.

1061
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
She refused.

1062
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Okay.  se acabo todo.  Get out!

1063
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Fiesta in the Heights!

1064
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000

1066
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000

-Relax.  que relaxed?
I'm relaxed.

1070
01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
I get so busy with the store

1071
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
It's a brand new chore

1072
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
No time for the dance floor

1073
01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Interject some

1099
01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
The way you flex on the floor

1100
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Get the next one

1101
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Interject some

1102
01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000
The way you flex on the floor

1103
01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Let me get an amaretto sour

1104
01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.000
You complete me

1105
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
You know you need me

1106
01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Let's get freaky

1107
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
The strong and silent type

1108
01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Caribbean island type

1109
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
All night

1110
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Say something

1111
01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
- Where you been?

1112
01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000
-Yo. you been
doing your thing all night!

1113
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Yeah. hold up.
Wait. wait. Let's take a shot.

1114
01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000
-You want a shot?
-No. it's fine.

1115
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Let me get you a shot.

1116
01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
-I'll be right back.
I'll be right back!

1117
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Two shots. please! Same thing.

1118
01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
-

1119
01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
-

1120
01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Ay. Dios!

1121
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
-

1122
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Ay. Dios!

1123
01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
We are powerless

1124
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
These goddamn doors

1125
01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Somebody better open
these goddamn doors

1126
01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.000
-I can't find Usnavi!

1127
01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.000
-

1128
01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.000
-

1129
01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.000
-

1130
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000
-

1131
01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Everybody is nervous

1132
01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Streetlights out of service

1133
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Our hour is at hand

1134
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
-

1135
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
We gon' light up the night

1136
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Everybody. let's focus

1137
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Grab your ammo and stack up

1138
01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Till the power comes

1139
01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.000
-When was the last time
you saw her?

1140
01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
-Did she text you?
Did she call you?

1141
01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.000
I called her twice
and I texted her.

1142
01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.000
-She not hittin' me back.
-Get out of my car!

1143
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
I gotta get
to the dispatch. man.

1144
01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Yo. I gotta wait
for Vanessa. man.

1145
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
-What are you talking about?
-Look. I might not

1146
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
but I still
got one tonight. Nina.

1147
01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Let it go.

1148
01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
I can't.
Just stick with Usnavi.

1149
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.000
I'll see you later. all right?

1150
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.000
We are powerless.
we are powerless

1151
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000
And shoving and shouting

1152
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
-

1153
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
-

1154
01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
-

1155
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000
You barely even

1156
01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.000
I've been trying all night

1157
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.000
With like half of the Heights

1158
01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.000
-

1159
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
-

1160
01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.000
-

1161
01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.000
from us tonight

1162
01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Anything tonight

1163
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Keep running away
From home

1164
01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Look at the fireworks fly

1165
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Nagle at Broadway.
I got a woman in labor.

1166
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.000
she needs to go to
Columbia Presbyterian Hospital.

1167
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Can you get her there?
Thank you and happy birthday.

1168
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Yo. Kevin. I. um... I routed
all the incoming calls

1169
01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000
-and I got the generator
covering the outgoing.

1170
01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
You smart.

1171
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
-You so smart.
- Hi. baby.

1172
01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
You got here mad quick.
What's going on?

1173
01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Yeah. long night
at the club.

1174
01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Usnavi. what's wrong?

1175
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
-Forget about it.
-Have a drink.

1176
01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Toast to drama.

1177
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Ay.
but you're too comfortable.

1178
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:25.000
G-51.
-Bingo. mother-lovers!

1179
01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Atención.
if you don't have a fare.

1180
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
...at the synagogue
and head up to Regiment.

1181
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.000
So if you're
crossing the bridge.

1182
01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
-pick up multiple riders.
-Go up to Dyckman. then.

1183
01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Do what you gotta do.

1184
01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
I'll get you some water
in a minute.

1185
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
All right. Put your feet up.

1186
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
-That's better.
-All right.

1187
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000
-Ooh. That's better.
-You okay?

1188
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
-Yes. thank you.
-All right.

1189
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Look at the fireworks

1190
01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Look at the fireworks

1191
01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.000
I'm done. I'm done.
- Are we touching

1192
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Oh. my God. The fear!

1193
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000
In La Vibora

1194
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Of Havana

1195
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:44.000
The same as mine

1196
01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000
In La Vibora

1197
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.000
In the plaza

1198
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000
You would find work

1199
01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
In the sky

1200
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Beyond our streetlights!

1201
01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:18.000
You gotta bribe the supa

1202
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:23.000
In Washington Heights

1203
01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.000
En La Vibora

1204
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Anger in the streets

1205
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Playing with my friends

1206
01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Mama says we're poor

1207
01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.000
"Vamos a Nueva York"

1208
01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.000
But Nueva York had work

1209
01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Imagining what you'd do

1210
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:08.000
We went through

1211
01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
-

1212
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.000
You'd say

1213
01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.000
-

1214
01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Paciencia y--
-

1215
01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.000
In America

1216
01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Mayor La Guardia

1217
01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Welcoming Mami and me

1218
01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
-

1219
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Paciencia y fe
-

1220
01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Than you were

1221
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Trying to catch a break

1222
01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Finally got a job

1223
01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Polishing with pride

1224
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Of the Upper East Side

1225
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
The weeks into years

1226
01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.000
-

1227
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Paciencia y fe

1228
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
-

1229
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.000
When your dreams come true?

1230
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.000
-

1231
01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:55.000
I survived

1232
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Abuela.

1233
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Abuela.

1234
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Abuela. Abuela.

1235
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Daniela!

1236
01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Abuela.

1237
01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Daniela!

1238
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Call 911!

1239
01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.000
-Okay. okay. okay.
- Call 911!

1240
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:26.000
-Wait. what?
- I got you.

1241
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
What's going on?
-No. no...

1242
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Daniela!

1243
01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.000
What's happening?
- Bring her

1244
01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Come here with some towels!

1245
01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Okay. okay.

1246
01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
-It's gonna be okay.
-Abuela. it's gonna be okay.

1247
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.000
I'm right here. Abuela.
I'm right here.

1248
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
I'm right here. I'm right here.

1249
01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
I'm right here. I'm right here.

1250
01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.000
And pronounced...

1251
01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:34.000
She was already lying in bed

1252
01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:38.000
That her heart gave out

1253
01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
What they said

1254
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.000
A combination of the stress

1255
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Took her medicine

1256
01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:52.000
She went out in peace

1257
01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:56.000
In her hand

1258
01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Had simple pleasures

1259
01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Of things we ignore

1260
01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Bread crumbs

1261
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000
To raise this thing

1262
01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.000
"Praise to this"

1263
01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.000
The path was clear

1264
01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Claudia. Señor

1265
01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Doña Claudia. Señor

1266
01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Alabanza a
Doña Claudia. Señor

1267
01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Doña Claudia. Señor

1268
01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Doña Claudia. Señor

1269
01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:50.000
-

1270
01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:54.000
-

1271
01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Paciencia y fe.
Doña Claudia

1272
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Should we take a break?

1273
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
No. Daddy. keep going.

1274
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Hey. Pop.

1275
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Best days of my life.

1276
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.000
It's creepy quiet.

1277
01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Usually. the One Train's
up there. screeching.

1278
01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Yo. I was thinking...
there's so much stuff going on.

1279
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:43.000
And all it just got me thinking
about is. like... all the

1280
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.000
And I just thought about you.

1281
01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
You're about
to change zip codes.

1282
01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Country codes. actually.

1283
01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Yeah. but
that's not till August.

1284
01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.000
I mean. you know. we got time.

1285
01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Usnavi...

1286
01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:10.000
I'm the girl who paints nails.

1287
01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.000
There's plenty like me.
here and over there.

1288
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Stop!

1289
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Yo. you're an artist.

1290
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Yo. your senior year
lab book...

1291
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:37.000
I should've been
paying attention

1292
01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:42.000
all them doodles you made.

1293
01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Yo. it was like...

1294
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Wonder Woman  meets...

1295
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
The Simpsons  meets...

1296
01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Guernica.

1297
01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
-And I would...

1298
01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
I would watch. like...

1299
01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.000
I just want to see
the whole world

1300
01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Mira para allá.

1301
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Benny. you know.
before I bought Rosario's...

1302
01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
it was O'Hanrahan's.

1303
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.000
The whole block was Irish.

1304
01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
You know why I bought it?

1305
01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.000
My dad. he. uh... he pulled me
out of high school.

1306
01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:49.000
so that I could work on
the same farm as him.

1307
01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Making the same pennies.

1308
01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.000
I thought to myself.
"No. no. no.  papi."

1309
01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:57.000
"That don't make no sense."

1310
01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:01.000
I'm gonna drop out
so somebody else

1311
01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
So I came here.

1312
01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:09.000
So I could make
my own damn work.

1313
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:12.000
But. you never
finished high school?

1314
01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.000
But Nina did.

1315
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:44.000
You asked me.
"What a  sueñito  means?"

1316
01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
I'm not gonna sit here
and give you

1317
01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
some fairy tale version.

1318
01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:54.000
You know. a dream isn't some
sparkly diamond we get.

1319
01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:58.000
You know. sometimes. it's...
it's rough.

1320
01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
And it's not so pretty.

1321
01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.000
-Yeah!
-

1322
01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:08.000
DACA was not
a gift from some benevolent

1323
01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:11.000
-No.
-No!

1324
01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
You made
it happen. you fought for it.

1325
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
And that's why
it still continues now.

1326
01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:22.000
'Cause what about the people
who don't qualify.

1327
01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:26.000
She gets into college
without papers. but...

1328
01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.000
no work-study for her.
no federal aid for her

1329
01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:32.000
so she doesn't
get to go to college.

1330
01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:37.000
-What did she say?
-She said her niece

1331
01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:41.000
We can dream bigger

1332
01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Yo. Sonny!

1333
01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
What's going on man?

1334
01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Let's do this. Yes!

1335
01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
I knew I couldn't
get a license.

1336
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
But no college?

1337
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
She was talking
about undocumented folks.

1338
01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:35.000
I remember when I was your age.
they used to say...

1339
01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:39.000
"If you work hard
and you live by the rules.

1340
01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.000
the money will come.
the things will come.

1341
01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.000
And that. those things
will complete you."

1342
01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
But. they won't.

1343
01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:02.000
We work so hard to try
and get there. that we forget

1344
01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
I was gonna be like you.

1345
01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Share your stories!

1346
01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Share your stories.
There's nothing

1347
01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Tell our stories!

1348
01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Tell our stories!
Tell our stories!

1349
01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Tell our stories!
Tell our stories!

1350
01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Dad. I know what I have to do.

1351
01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:41.000
You've given me
this amazing education

1352
01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:45.000
and figure out how
every undocumented kid

1353
01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Maybe Stanford isn't a way out.
Maybe it's a way back.

1354
01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
Like Abuela
always used to say...

1355
01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:56.000
asserting our dignity
in small ways.

1356
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Wow.

1357
01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.000
This is it. huh.  mija?

1358
01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.000
What?

1359
01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
This is the moment
when you do better than me.

1360
01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Not because of
some fancy degree...

1361
01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:21.000
It's 'cause you can
see a future that I can't.

1362
01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Hey...

1363
01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
You're  Nuyoricua.

1364
01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:34.000
We're a people on the move.
so yeah. bring us with you.

1365
01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Ignore anyone who doubts you.

1366
01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:45.000
You take all the bruises. baby.
but you stay in the ring.

1367
01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
I called.
and it's still available.

1368
01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.000
But Vanessa needs a co-signer.
and not one who's about

1369
01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Would you?

1370
01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
As a personal favor?

1371
01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
We're all ready. ma'am.

1372
01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:40.000
That's  señorita  to you.

1373
01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Yes. Yes. ma'am--
Señorita.  Yes.

1374
01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:53.000
Listas.  We'll follow behind.

1375
01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
-It's hotter in here.
-Put on the AC.

1376
01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Come find me in the Bronx.

1377
01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:08.000
3843 Grand Concourse.

1378
01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Where the hell is everybody?

1379
01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Diablo.  It's like
they've given up.

1380
01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Bye. people!

1381
01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Bye!

1382
01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Carajo.

1383
01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Ungrateful!

1384
01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Our matriarch bites the dust.
and this is how we move on?

1385
01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:12.000
We are not power-less.
We are powerful.

1386
01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:15.000
If Claudia was here.
she'd say.  "P'alante."

1387
01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:20.000
In Puerto Rico.
blackouts happen all the time.

1388
01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:26.000
This is like
Gilligan's Ghetto Island.

1389
01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Mi amor. cálmate.  huh?
What would Jesus do?

1390
01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Do I look like Jesus to you?

1391
01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
I mean.
sometimes when I squint.

1392
01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:48.000
That I'm seeing

1393
01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:52.000
I'd see the day

1394
01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Scared of heat?

1395
01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Growing up in the hills

1396
01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Was Christmas time

1397
01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
-

1398
01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.000
An ounce of snow

1399
01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:16.000
The coquito would flow

1400
01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:22.000
The carnaval

1401
01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:29.000
And we're about to go

1402
01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Get off your butt. avanza!

1403
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Bring your tambourine

1404
01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Dani. I have a question

1405
01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:36.000
What you're cantando

1406
01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:41.000
We are improvisando

1407
01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Lo. le. lo. lai

1408
01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
-Wait. what?

1409
01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Into your head

1410
01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:53.000
My dad is from Chile

1411
01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
I'm from Queens

1412
01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:11.000
We're sweating

1413
01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:16.000
This block's getting worse

1414
01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
With a friend

1415
01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Shove you

1416
01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:25.000
That Usnavi's your "friend"

1417
01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:28.000
That he love you

1418
01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Wow.

1419
01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:34.000
That sexual tension

1420
01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
-

1421
01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
For free

1422
01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Here comes Usnavi!

1423
01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Everyone gather 'round

1424
01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
I got an announcement

1425
01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Holding me down

1426
01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Tell the whole town

1427
01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Sonny. grab everybody

1428
01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Kiss it up to God

1429
01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
It's time to fly. though

1430
01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
pack up the carro

1431
01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
For DR tomorrow!

1432
01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:16.000
La bandera dominicana

1433
01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:20.000
La bandera puertorriqueña

1434
01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:25.000
La bandera mexicana

1435
01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:29.000
La bandera cubana

1436
01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
-

1437
01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
-

1438
01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
-

1439
01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:42.000
-

1440
01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
Hey!

1441
01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Have you seen

1442
01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Went for a roll in the hay!

1443
01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Benny and Nina.
Sitting in a tree

1444
01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:21.000
-It's your fault.

1445
01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Nina and Benny

1446
01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:29.000
-Okay. okay.

1447
01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:34.000
For the Dominican Republic

1448
01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
And stole the girl

1449
01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:38.000
My babysitter first!

1450
01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Is this what y'all want?

1451
01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
The neighborhood is gone

1452
01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
And they closin' the salon

1453
01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
The lights back on

1454
01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:50.000
We are powerless

1455
01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
And singin' and celebratin'

1456
01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
And this place disintegratin'

1457
01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:59.000
We are powerless

1458
01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
So light up a candle

1459
01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
That we can't handle!

1460
01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Call in the coroners

1461
01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:08.000
A corner full of foreigners

1462
01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
Changing forever

1463
01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Is our last night together

1464
01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
When the end is so close

1465
01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
With your head in the sand

1466
01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
That I got in my hand

1467
01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
-

1468
01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:27.000
-

1469
01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
Our voice tonight?

1470
01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Can we make
A little noise tonight?

1471
01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Contiene mi alma entera

1472
01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Can we sing so loud

1473
01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Across the bridge

1474
01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
To Santo Domingo

1475
01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:49.000
We rep our people

1476
01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
What coulda been

1477
01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.000
In the hood again

1478
01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.000
-

1479
01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:17.000
-

1480
01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:22.000
-

1481
01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Alza la bandera.
la bandera mexicana

1482
01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:31.000
La bandera

1483
01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:35.000
la bandera

1484
01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:03.000
We love you!
We love you! Bye!

1485
01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:16.000
All right.
Watch your hand. move--

1486
01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Okay. okay. okay...
Got it...

1487
01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
-My finger!
-Oh. my gosh. Yo.

1488
01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:23.000
Listen. I got this.
Just push. Just push down.

1489
01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Oh. my gosh.

1490
01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
Ooh!

1491
01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:34.000
Oh. my gosh. You're only
gone to Thanksgiving.

1492
01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Nina.

1493
01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
Let me just listen to my block.

1494
01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
Sunset looked better
in the blackout.

1495
01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Well. how about...

1496
01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:15.000
...we pretend
we're still in it?

1497
01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
-I like that.
-Yeah?

1498
01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:21.000
Early July...

1499
01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:25.000
The whole summer
is ahead of us.

1500
01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Need a flashlight

1501
01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:47.000
A calling card

1502
01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:52.000
'Cuz I'm falling hard
For you

1503
01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:01.000
To make my way

1504
01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:41.000
That's when
I'll see your face again

1505
01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:49.000
I'll be waiting

1506
01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:58.000
-

1507
01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Drift apart

1508
01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:05.000
-

1509
01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:08.000
-

1510
01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Change the world some day

1511
01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Every night

1512
01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Nina didn't even let them
drive her to the airport.

1513
01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
She had to take that step
on her own.

1514
01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:38.000
An independent. stubborn lady.
Like you.  hija.

1515
01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:40.000
And that's good.

1516
01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
What?

1517
01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
No. you didn't!

1518
01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
No. you didn't!

1519
01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:53.000
No. you did not!

1520
01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:57.000
Yo. you playing tricks on me!

1521
01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Yo. you playing tricks
on me. man!

1522
01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
Yo. Abuela...

1523
01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Hello? Yes. what time
do you close?

1524
01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Word! Yes!

1525
01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:17.000
Okay. thank you so much.
Thank you. bye.

1526
01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
Whoa!

1527
01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Hi!

1528
01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:23.000
-Were you just
standing there. just...

1529
01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
I... I heard you
fly out tomorrow.

1530
01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Yeah.

1531
01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
-Yo. come in. come in. come in.
-Thanks.

1532
01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
Yeah.

1533
01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.000
So how's the new spot?

1534
01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:41.000
It's great.

1535
01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:48.000
My fingers won't budge.
I haven't sewn a single thing

1536
01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
-You will.
-Yeah.

1537
01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Just... waiting for inspiration
to strike. I guess.

1538
01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Well. you're pretty creative
and artistic. I mean...

1539
01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:02.000
-So... it's gonna hit you.
I think.

1540
01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
-

1541
01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:24.000
-

1542
01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:33.000
Of cold champagne

1543
01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:38.000
-

1544
01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:41.000
All sweaty and everything

1545
01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
-

1546
01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:48.000
I already packed the cups

1547
01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:53.000
Straight from the bottle

1548
01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
-

1549
01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:58.000
What you did for me

1550
01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:03.000
The sweetest thing

1551
01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:11.000
To possibly repay you

1552
01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:14.000
This gold shit off?

1553
01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:17.000
-

1554
01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:24.000
And the signs are taken down

1555
01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:29.000
the neighborhood

1556
01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:33.000
-

1557
01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:36.000
To open this champagne

1558
01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
Is broken

1559
01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:41.000
Open this damn champagne

1560
01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
-

1561
01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:46.000
drop the champagne

1562
01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:49.000
To all this trouble

1563
01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:54.000
It's been a long day

1564
02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:03.000
-

1565
02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:07.000
Maybe save this place

1566
02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:12.000
Sonny's got role models

1567
02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
-

1568
02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:17.000
Yo. what are
you talking about?

1569
02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
Can wait

1570
02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
Vanessa. you left us too

1571
02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:24.000
West Fourth Street

1572
02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
-

1573
02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Gonna see you again

1574
02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
You trying to say?

1575
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
Addicted to your coffee

1576
02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:38.000
Why you're mad at me

1577
02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
How long
does this process take?

1578
02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:29.000
Well.
from the original

1579
02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:34.000
appearances. appeals.
to a final decision...

1580
02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
could be five months.

1581
02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
Or five years.

1582
02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:41.000
Five years?
- Yeah.

1583
02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:45.000
For a green card
or a rejection.

1584
02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:49.000
See. the courts work
at their own speed.

1585
02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
Then we start today.

1586
02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
This is worth 96.000.

1587
02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:04.000
How much fight
does this buy us?

1588
02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:08.000
I wanna pay for your fee.
and the rest put

1589
02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:13.000
-Dude.
-It don't matter.

1590
02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:15.000
Holy shit.
that's a lot of money.

1591
02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:18.000
-Watch your mouth. bro.
-When did you get that?

1592
02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
What you mean.
when did I get it? Don't worry

1593
02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:23.000
Why you always
asking questions?

1594
02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:26.000
You know. payment in checks
is more common.

1595
02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
I leave on the first flight
in the morning.

1596
02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
I don't have time
to cash in now.

1597
02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
I wish I did. but I like--

1598
02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Please.

1599
02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
All right.

1600
02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
Bueno. mijo...

1601
02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:47.000
...this is gonna be
an emotional rollercoaster.

1602
02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:50.000
It may end in heartbreak.

1603
02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:53.000
-But. there's a chance. right?
-Yeah.

1604
02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:57.000
But it's my responsibility
to make sure that he knows...

1605
02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:01.000
the odds are against you.

1606
02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
Understood.

1607
02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
I still want to fight. though.

1608
02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
Okay.

1609
02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:54.000
Pete!

1610
02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Seriously?

1611
02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
My bad. Use one of those rags.

1612
02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Hey...

1613
02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:19.000
How much for this?

1614
02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:22.000
Free. I got tons like that.

1615
02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
You hear that?

1616
02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:45.000
The voices of the gods.

1617
02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:51.000
My last morning.
the One Train...

1618
02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
sounded like Juan Luis Guerra.

1619
02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:57.000
And the garbage trucks
smelled like island flowers.

1620
02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:09.000
Best days of my life.

1621
02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
Here I come.

1622
02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:51.000
Para siempre--

1623
02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
Para siem--

1624
02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:55.000
-

1625
02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
And on and on

1626
02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
But I'm doing the math

1627
02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:04.000
To have Sonny

1628
02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:07.000
Up on a beach

1629
02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:11.000
How it's gonna be

1630
02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:12.000
Leavin' today

1631
02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:41.000
-

1632
02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
-

1633
02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:53.000
-

1634
02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:56.000
-

1635
02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:59.000
-

1636
02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
-

1637
02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:07.000
-

1638
02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
-

1639
02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Off the Hudson

1640
02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:20.000
You're sick of living here

1641
02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Off the fire escapes

1642
02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:25.000
Blasting Big Pun tapes

1643
02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:28.000
To tell you the truth

1644
02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:31.000
From his dispatch booth

1645
02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
Vanessa at the salon

1646
02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:37.000
But who's gonna notice

1647
02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
To a crawl. son

1648
02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:44.000
When we're all done?

1649
02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:49.000
In the long run

1650
02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
I'll miss Abuela's whispers

1651
02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:54.000
Every Christmas

1652
02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:58.000
When this whole city's

1653
02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:02.000
This raggedy little business?

1654
02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
Hey. you.

1655
02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:13.000
Hey.

1656
02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:15.000
Do you have two minutes?

1657
02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
Yeah.

1658
02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
You said you wanted
to see the world

1659
02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
-Yeah.
-Come with me.

1660
02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:29.000
-No peeking.
-All right.

1661
02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:32.000
-Okay.
-All right.

1662
02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:33.000
Watch it.

1663
02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:37.000
-Where am I going?
-Just stand right here.

1664
02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:38.000
-Where?
-No peeking.

1665
02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:41.000
-I'm not--
-I can feel you trying

1666
02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
-I'm not trying--
-Just don't.

1667
02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:45.000
Hold on.

1668
02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
Okay. open.

1669
02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:03.000
After I left your place
last night. I just...

1670
02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:07.000
walked around for a while.

1671
02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:10.000
And then I ran into Pete.

1672
02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:13.000
And I saw one
of his drop cloths. and...

1673
02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
I thought that this
is my next piece.

1674
02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:22.000
So I called Sonny and I told
him to open up the bodega.

1675
02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
'cause my fingers
needed to move.

1676
02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:39.000
She started working
and was like.

1677
02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
So I started painting.

1678
02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
Yo. how did you...

1679
02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
That's my dad's beach.

1680
02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:08.000
Yeah. You had all those photos
by the register.

1681
02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
I worked from memory.

1682
02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
-I did the crab in the corner.
-

1683
02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
What's so funny?

1684
02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:19.000
Who cares
about the crab in the corner?

1685
02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:21.000
What you mean.
the crab is like the best part.

1686
02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:23.000
No. it is not.
It's in the corner

1687
02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
So what. are you saying
you don't like my crab?

1688
02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
I may be saying
a lot of things.

1689
02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
that just looks like
a fourth-grader drew that.

1690
02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
You could sell that.
- No. I cannot.

1691
02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
-25 cents?
- No.

1692
02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
What?

1693
02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
-Yeah.
-I'm saying... just...

1694
02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
-He hates it.
-

1695
02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:51.000
He's forming
an artistic opinion.

1696
02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
What?

1697
02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:16.000
Need some new cans

1698
02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:17.000
There's been
A slight change of plans

1699
02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
I'm not playin'

1700
02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:23.000
Tell the whole block

1701
02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:26.000
Tell everyone we know

1702
02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:31.000
Yo! Usnavi's stayin'!

1703
02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:33.000
Chillin' in the heat

1704
02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
Of the people in the street

1705
02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:39.000
Some are bittersweet

1706
02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
And that's what

1707
02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:44.000
-Yeah!
-

1708
02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:47.000
The coffee sweet

1709
02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
You live in my memories

1710
02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:52.000
This corner is my destiny

1711
02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:55.000
We pass a test

1712
02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
You know I'll never leave

1713
02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:01.000
That hydrant is a beach

1714
02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
On a palm tree

1715
02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
But I ain't goin' back

1716
02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:08.000
Your story

1717
02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
To you smilin'

1718
02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:14.000
I'm home

1719
02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:29.000
Until then...

1720
02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:30.000
I thought it was past tense.

1721
02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:32.000
What?

1722
02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:34.000
The best days of my life.

1723
02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:37.000
So I stayed.

1724
02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:40.000
And I built my little dream.
my  sueñito.

1725
02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:44.000
here. in Washington Heights.

1726
02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
Say it.
so it doesn't disappear.

1727
02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:49.000
Washington Heights!

1728
02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:52.000
Because this place...
this is it.

1729
02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:56.000
You... you.  nena.

1730
02:12:58.000 --> 02:12:59.000
You're it.

1731
02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
Para siempre--

1732
02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
I have a date tonight.

1733
02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:06.000
I take note.

1734
02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:07.000
But. there's a chance. right?

1735
02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
We sold... a winner!

1736
02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
Start small. dream big.

1737
02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Little details...

1738
02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:16.000
that tell the world
we are not invisible.

1739
02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
Can we go to the water now?

1740
02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Man. you've been
talking forever.

1741
02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
Yeah. come on. Iris.

1742
02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
Please. Daddy? Can I go. too?

1743
02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
Ask your mother.

1744
02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
Mami.  can I?

1745
02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
Please?

1746
02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
Yes.  mi vida.  go.

1747
02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:41.000
Yes!

1748
02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:43.000
Love you. Daddy.

1749
02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:00.000
-

1750
02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
That I've known

1751
02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
Building and Loan!

1752
02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:10.000
-

1753
02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
That's your throne

1754
02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:19.000
Have all flown

1755
02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
And I drop this hip-hop

1756
02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:24.000
I'm home

1757
02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:27.000
Let me show all of these people

1758
02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
The record straight

1759
02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:34.000
I'm gettin' a second date

1760
02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
Where it's 100 in the shade

1761
02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:39.000
We remain unafraid

1762
02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
In the air?

1763
02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
To the top of the world

1764
02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:51.000
The islands are today

1765
02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:56.000
Has broken down

1766
02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:58.000
Send somebody over here.
I don't--

1767
02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:04.000
All his customers my way

1768
02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:10.000
Ain't that some shit?

1769
02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
Hike up the price

1770
02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
Lai. lo. le. lo. lai!

1771
02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:26.000
Blackouts on ice

1772
02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:31.000
Keep scraping by
