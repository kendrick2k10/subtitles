00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.680
Okay. It’s locked.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.930
[Walker] Are you sure no one
followed you home from the bank?

7
00:00:12.054 --> 00:00:13.184
Uh. yeah.

8
00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:15.103
[Walker]
I’m texting you something.

9
00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:23.566
Oh. my God. Who is that?

10
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.860
[Walker] It’s the bodyguard
I hired in Oslo.

11
00:00:25.943 --> 00:00:27.113
they’re onto me. Eliza.

12
00:00:27.236 --> 00:00:28.276
I’m gonna get a plane ticket

13
00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:29.653
and come to you right away.

14
00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:30.988
[Walker]
No. no. no. no. no need.

15
00:00:31.073 --> 00:00:34.033
Just meet me
as we planned. all right?

16
00:00:34.117 --> 00:00:35.617
-So you made it back?
-[Walker] Yeah.

17
00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:37.874
but I-I-I need to go into hiding
for a while.

18
00:00:37.955 --> 00:00:39.795
Just bring the money.

19
00:00:39.915 --> 00:00:42.585
-All of it?
-[Walker] Yes. I. uh.

20
00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:45.129
I’m not sure how long
I’m gonna be gone but Eliza.

21
00:00:45.254 --> 00:00:47.464
listen to me. we’re still
getting married as promised.

22
00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:48.629
I know.

23
00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:51.047
I know. baby. I...

24
00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:52.684
just stay safe.

25
00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:54.301
I’ll meet you tonight.

26
00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.389
[Walker] All right.
See you tonight.

27
00:00:57.432 --> 00:00:58.602
And don’t forget the money.

28
00:00:58.684 --> 00:00:59.564
I won’t.

29
00:00:59.643 --> 00:01:00.603
I love you.

Working hard?

Oh. God. Vivian.

36
00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:02.831
Looking at bids
for that beautiful tutor

37
00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:04.286
on Buffalo Point?

38
00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:06.544
No. But I got two offers
this morning. so...

39
00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:08.038
[Vivian]
I know what you were doing.

40
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.840
You are on that app
all the time.

41
00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:11.513
-I am not.
-[Vivian] Oh. come on.

42
00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:13.802
Every time I pass by.
I see you looking.

43
00:02:13.884 --> 00:02:16.014
I’m just checking for matches.

44
00:02:16.094 --> 00:02:18.184
You really think
you can find love

45
00:02:18.263 --> 00:02:21.063
looking at dozens
of men’s pictures?

46
00:02:21.183 --> 00:02:22.853
Yeah. I guess I do.

47
00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:26.186
Okay. Maybe it takes
a little bit of effort

48
00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:28.401
but there’s a Mr. Right
out there

49
00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:31.403
and I have to put myself
where he can find me.

50
00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:33.356
Well. you’ve always been
a romantic.

51
00:02:33.487 --> 00:02:35.737
but I thought after Frank.
you were gonna--

52
00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:40.034
It’s been four months
and I am ready for a new start.

53
00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:43.165
[phone chimes]

54
00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:45.076
[Vivian] Let me check that out.

55
00:02:48.543 --> 00:02:50.383
-Oh.
-[Kate] Looks like a real man.

56
00:02:50.462 --> 00:02:53.422
He’s not one of those jocks
or man boys and. look.

57
00:02:53.548 --> 00:02:55.428
it looks like
he’s close with his parents.

58
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.930
which is always
a good thing. right?

59
00:02:57.052 --> 00:02:58.852
[Vivian] He can dress
that’s for sure.

60
00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:05.936
hmm. looks too good to be true.

61
00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:11.483
Oh. I guess
we’ll find out soon enough.

62
00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.569
He invited me out
for drinks tonight.

63
00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:17.196
Tonight?

64
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.740
That’s fast.

65
00:03:18.824 --> 00:03:20.164
He’s decisive.

66
00:03:20.242 --> 00:03:21.912
I like it.

67
00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:24.623
You know. maybe I should
tag along inconspicuously.

68
00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:26.826
Make sure
he doesn’t jet off with you.

69
00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:28.955
Not before you sell the tutor.

70
00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:31.134
You are very funny.

71
00:03:31.253 --> 00:03:33.133
Uh-hmm.

72
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.390
That’s literally what I...

73
00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:50.148
I didn’t say
I wanna go through this now.

74
00:03:50.272 --> 00:03:52.232
Okay.
Well. what’s a better time?

75
00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:53.435
[Kate] Walker?

76
00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:54.607
Just. okay. just hang on.

77
00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:57.033
all right. just go. okay?

78
00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:01.616
Kate Burns I presume.

79
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.080
Yes.

80
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.290
I am--I am so sorry.

81
00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:07.712
Uh. is everything okay?

82
00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:10.329
Yeah. yeah. yeah.
It’s just my ex-girlfriend.

83
00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.129
She knows where I stay
when I’m in town

84
00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:14.422
and it’s nothing.

85
00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:16.344
Maybe you two should talk?

86
00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:20.472
No. no. no. We. um.
we don’t need to be having

87
00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:22.512
the same conversation
we’ve been having for months.

88
00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:24.467
And I’d much rather
to be speaking to you

89
00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:27.678
but I totally understand
if you wanna leave.

90
00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:33.651
Well. uh. we all have exes.

91
00:04:33.774 --> 00:04:35.614
So you’ll stay?

92
00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:37.072
I’ll stay.

93
00:04:37.152 --> 00:04:39.402
All right.
Well. let’s have a drink.

94
00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:43.989
So what can I get for you?

95
00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:47.657
No. let me guess.

96
00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:51.623
You have intelligence.
um. a wine drinker.

97
00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:55.548
white wine. dry.

98
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.920
touch of something floral
or fruity.

99
00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:00.677
How do you do that?

100
00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:03.141
It’s my job
to read my client’s tastes.

101
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.850
Who are your clients?

102
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.970
I’m an art dealer
for some wealthy individuals

103
00:05:07.057 --> 00:05:09.017
but I do travel a lot.

104
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.600
so I hope
that’s not a deal breaker.

105
00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:13.645
No. I. uh. I gathered that
from your Instagram.

106
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.480
What kind of art
do you usually buy?

107
00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:18.396
Mostly European masters.

108
00:05:18.527 --> 00:05:20.777
But Kate Burns.
I wanna know all about you.

109
00:05:20.862 --> 00:05:22.322
How do you spend your days?

110
00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:25.325
Uh. selling houses.

111
00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:26.988
I’m a real estate agent.

112
00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:28.657
How did you get in that?

113
00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:31.575
Well. I started my career
in journalism.

114
00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:33.166
[Walker] Okay. Covering?

115
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.080
Mostly local government.

116
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.630
city council meetings.
things like that.

117
00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:39.762
So big fish in small ponds?

118
00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:41.671
I mean. that must’ve been
pretty interesting.

119
00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:44.758
-Not interesting enough.
-Yeah?

120
00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:46.796
I. uh. I tag along
with my best friend

121
00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:48.888
when she did open houses
on the weekends.

122
00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:50.515
-Uh-hmm.
-And eventually

123
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.890
I discovered
I liked what she did

124
00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:53.388
more than working
at a newspaper.

125
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.980
Well. I’m gonna take
a guess you’re very good at it.

126
00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:59.114
-Seemed like a natural fit.
-Uh-hmm.

127
00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:02.073
-So. Walker.
-Uh-hmm.

128
00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:03.275
I like that name.

129
00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:04.615
It’s unique.

130
00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:06.119
It’s a family name.

131
00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:07.911
So you’re a junior?

132
00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:10.294
No. No. no.
it’s my mother’s maiden name.

133
00:06:10.412 --> 00:06:11.912
She. uh.
she didn’t have any brothers

134
00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:13.118
on that side of the family

135
00:06:13.248 --> 00:06:14.868
to continue the name. so...

136
00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.538
Oh.

137
00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:17.956
What would your name be

138
00:06:18.086 --> 00:06:19.996
if you got your mother’s
maiden name?

139
00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:22.716
Johnson. Yeah.

140
00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:25.089
-It would have been really bad.
-Okay.

141
00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:26.178
[laughs]

142
00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:27.641
[waitress] Yes. Mr. Stevenson?

143
00:06:27.762 --> 00:06:30.722
Uh. could we get your best
bottle of champagne please?

144
00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:31.887
Absolutely.

145
00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:33.485
-That okay?
-Sure.

146
00:06:33.602 --> 00:06:37.812
Do you have
the Dom Perignon 2012?

147
00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:40.229
-Of course.
-And two chilled flutes please.

148
00:06:40.317 --> 00:06:42.277
Absolutely.

149
00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:44.032
-Champagne?
-Uh-hmm.

150
00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:45.612
What are we celebrating?

151
00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:46.987
Natural fits.

152
00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:49.025
When people
and names just click.

153
00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:52.867
it’s good to stop and celebrate.

154
00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:58.576
[Kate] Copenhagen. Really?

155
00:06:58.668 --> 00:06:59.788
[Walker] I know.

156
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.130
I know most people
don’t see it

157
00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:02.762
as one of the best
European cities

158
00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:05.629
but with the type of art
I specialize in.

159
00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:08.929
it’s just as rich
as Rome. Paris.

160
00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:13.522
Berlin. now you go.

161
00:07:13.642 --> 00:07:14.932
Marseille.

162
00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:17.018
-Wow. really?
-Yeah. I know.

163
00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:19.015
It’s not as glamorous
as some of the others.

164
00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:20.647
No. no. no. no. Absolutely.

165
00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:21.984
I love Marseille.

166
00:07:22.067 --> 00:07:23.777
Its harbors
and markets are amazing.

167
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.740
I just...
I didn’t expect that from you.

168
00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:32.788
It’s actually the only time
I’ve ever been abroad.

169
00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:34.449
Junior year in college.

170
00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:36.707
Well. hopefully that changes.

171
00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:38.881
Travel is the spice of life.

172
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.540
Oh. well. I would love
to travel. believe me.

173
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:45.550
It’s just. um. I guess
I’ve been working a lot lately.

174
00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:49.434
Well. I travel to Europe mostly
to assess art clients.

175
00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:50.801
Assess?

176
00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:52.387
Yeah. it’s my job to see

177
00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:53.684
if the painting is an original

178
00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:55.387
and if it’s in good shape

179
00:07:55.517 --> 00:07:56.807
for my clients to make an offer.

180
00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:58.983
-Do they ever come along?
-Uh. no.

181
00:07:59.062 --> 00:08:01.692
Way too busy.
That’s why they hire me.

182
00:08:03.984 --> 00:08:07.494
Have you. uh.
have you ever been married?

183
00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:10.911
No.

184
00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:13.492
Ever gotten close?

185
00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:16.537
I thought so.

186
00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:18.211
What happened?

187
00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:21.381
He didn’t.

188
00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:24.002
His mistake.

189
00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:28.508
Have you?

190
00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:31.591
My job makes it very difficult.

191
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.390
I find that hard to believe.

192
00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:35.853
Most women
like the fancy dinners

193
00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:37.772
and exotic travel
but inevitably

194
00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:41.232
they grow tired of me
being out of town all the time.

195
00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:43.862
That’s exactly why I joined
the app because I figured.

196
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.780
"Hey. if I’m honest
right off the bat

197
00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:49.951
then maybe there’ll be
no trouble down the road."

198
00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:53.911
But that’s what’s
most important to me. Kate.

199
00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:56.744
It’s honesty.

200
00:08:57.871 --> 00:08:59.711
Yeah. For me too.

201
00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:02.379
Well. if I’m being honest. I...

202
00:09:03.418 --> 00:09:05.628
had a wonderful night.

203
00:09:05.754 --> 00:09:07.964
So did I.

204
00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:10.469
If I’m being really honest.

205
00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:13.592
I wanna kiss you.

206
00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:43.175
Hey.

207
00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:03.273
So it looks like
Prince Charming was real.

208
00:10:03.353 --> 00:10:04.853
And a dream.

209
00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:06.309
Uh-oh.

210
00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:07.899
He was charming

211
00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:09.942
but he was also
super down-to-earth.

212
00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:13.106
He asked questions
and really listened.

213
00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:15.946
And sends flowers the next day.

214
00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:18.662
-Pretty perfect.
-Come on. Viv.

215
00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:20.585
Just let me enjoy this.

216
00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:23.372
Okay.
Just please don’t go too fast.

217
00:10:23.498 --> 00:10:27.288
-Get to know him.
-Don’t worry. I will.

218
00:10:37.512 --> 00:10:39.062
They’re beautiful.

219
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.560
And of course
you guessed my favorite flower.

220
00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:44.393
Well. milady.
they’re to remind you

221
00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:47.609
of the beauty of last night
and to apologize.

222
00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:48.899
For what?

223
00:10:49.023 --> 00:10:51.033
Well. I wanted
to ask you out again.

224
00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:54.281
immediately actually
but I just found out

225
00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:56.032
I gotta leave town for business.

226
00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:57.446
For how long?

227
00:10:57.532 --> 00:10:58.992
[Walker] Two weeks.

228
00:11:00.535 --> 00:11:01.665
Oh.

229
00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:03.124
Kate. I’m so. so sorry.

230
00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:04.414
That’s what I was talking about.

231
00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:05.959
It’s. uh.
it’s the nature of the job

232
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.830
and I know
it’s not easy for everyone.

233
00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:10.707
No. no. I completely understand.

234
00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:13.047
It’s for work.
You have to go.

235
00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:14.921
We can text when I’m gone

236
00:11:15.049 --> 00:11:18.259
and I’ll take you out
as soon as I get back.

237
00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:19.756
I promise.

238
00:11:19.888 --> 00:11:21.058
Of course.

239
00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:22.431
Have a good trip.

240
00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:24.227
Thanks.

241
00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:37.355
[phone chimes]

242
00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:53.877
[dramatic music]

243
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.310
[doorbell rings]

244
00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:11.188
Hi.

245
00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:12.822
Hey. babe.

246
00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:18.778
You did get some color.

247
00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:21.493
Well. I managed to get
to the beach on my last day.

248
00:12:24.118 --> 00:12:27.038
Well. I should be here
for the rest of the week.

249
00:12:27.121 --> 00:12:28.541
[Kate] Ah. lucky me.

250
00:12:28.623 --> 00:12:31.883
Well. maybe you could join me
one day.

251
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.670
Yeah. Maybe.

252
00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:35.055
Too soon?

253
00:12:35.129 --> 00:12:36.549
No. that’s not it.

254
00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:38.171
What then?

255
00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:40.629
Well. when you take off
at a moment’s notice.

256
00:12:40.718 --> 00:12:42.258
it’s for work.

257
00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:45.435
If I were to try
and get away like that.

258
00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:48.391
my job’s different.

259
00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:50.136
I get it.

260
00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.810
Maybe one day?

261
00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:54.398
One day.

262
00:12:56.025 --> 00:12:57.775
[dog barking]

263
00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.740
[man] Come on. Come on.

264
00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:01.111
Good boy.

265
00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:02.277
You like dogs?

266
00:13:02.365 --> 00:13:03.665
I love them.

267
00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:05.743
I wish I had one
but with the amount I work.

268
00:13:05.827 --> 00:13:07.327
it wouldn’t be fair.

269
00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:10.042
Growing up. I had a doggy
called Peppermint.

270
00:13:10.164 --> 00:13:13.384
cheeky little Maltese
with a crazy and a bite.

271
00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:15.001
Oh. no.

272
00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:17.169
What about you?

273
00:13:17.297 --> 00:13:18.877
Uh. ours was a Great Dane.

274
00:13:19.007 --> 00:13:20.547
-[Walker] Uh-huh.
-Geronimo.

275
00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:22.435
Geronimo. I like that.

276
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:26.390
Yeah. My dad was a big fan
of old Western movies.

277
00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:28.684
[scoffs] Geronimo.

278
00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:30.058
Yeah.

279
00:13:30.184 --> 00:13:31.984
It’s so beautiful out here.

280
00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:33.401
I wish you were here.

281
00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:34.861
Are you going to dinner soon?

282
00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:36.569
The hosts are throwing
a little party in my honor.

283
00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:38.651
Sounds like
they’re spoiling you.

284
00:13:38.735 --> 00:13:40.285
They are.
Which makes me think

285
00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:41.951
of spoiling you when I get back.

286
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:44.660
Ooh.
I like the sound of that.

287
00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:49.501
Kate. I just wanna say
I’ve never felt so at ease

288
00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:51.369
-with someone so quickly.
-I know.

289
00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:53.576
I can’t believe
it’s only been a month.

290
00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:55.498
[Walker] I really hope
I’m not moving too fast

291
00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:57.505
by asking this but...

292
00:13:58.629 --> 00:14:00.589
would you be my girlfriend?

293
00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:03.765
I don’t think
that’s moving too fast at all.

294
00:14:03.885 --> 00:14:05.095
I’d love to.

295
00:14:05.219 --> 00:14:07.049
I wish I was there
with you right now.

296
00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.930
Trust me. me too.

297
00:14:09.057 --> 00:14:12.427
But I better get cracking
before I’m late to my own party.

298
00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.810
-so...
-Of course.

299
00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:15.445
I’ll talk to you soon.

300
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:17.690
[computer beeps]

301
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.370
Whoa.

302
00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:31.156
Looks like
a botanical garden in here.

303
00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:34.505
You know. there is such a thing
as overkill.

304
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:38.790
Well. Walker.
he’s very effusive.

305
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.590
Hmm. Yeah. I’ll say.

306
00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:43.011
He likes buying me
beautiful things.

307
00:14:43.091 --> 00:14:45.131
You guys have only
been dating a month.

308
00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:47.179
And most of that time
he’s been out of town.

309
00:14:47.261 --> 00:14:51.561
Well. I mean.
we text and FaceTime every day.

310
00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:53.811
We like each other a lot.

311
00:14:53.935 --> 00:14:57.275
And look.

312
00:14:57.397 --> 00:14:58.807
He’s in Nice right now.

313
00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.690
That’s the Mediterranean
behind him.

314
00:15:00.775 --> 00:15:03.695
Yeah. it looks like
the Pacific to me.

315
00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:07.031
-Vivian.
-I want you to be happy.

316
00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:10.875
I do. I just think
you should also be careful.

317
00:15:10.952 --> 00:15:12.952
You hardly know this guy at all.

318
00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:15.959
Well. he’s a big-hearted
romantic.

319
00:15:16.082 --> 00:15:18.632
Uh. he gets home tomorrow.

320
00:15:18.751 --> 00:15:21.301
so you’ll meet him.
and then you’ll see.

321
00:15:26.551 --> 00:15:29.801
[dramatic music]

322
00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:36.307
[phone chimes]

323
00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.650
Hey. are you on your way?

324
00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:41.270
[Walker] I need you
to pick me up.

325
00:15:41.357 --> 00:15:43.357
-Sure. At the hotel?
-[Walker] No. no.

326
00:15:43.484 --> 00:15:45.074
I’m sending my coordinates.

327
00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:46.903
Coordinates?

328
00:15:46.988 --> 00:15:48.488
[Walker] Did you get it?

329
00:15:48.573 --> 00:15:50.913
[phone chimes]

330
00:15:53.035 --> 00:15:55.155
Uh-huh.
Walker. are you okay?

331
00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:57.538
[Walker] Yeah.
Just come quickly.

332
00:15:57.665 --> 00:15:59.625
Sure. I’ll be right there.
I can’t wait to...

333
00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:01.709
[phone beeping]

334
00:16:03.045 --> 00:16:07.045
[airplane engine revving]

335
00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:12.350

00:16:15.016 --> 00:16:16.176
[knocking on window]

337
00:16:16.267 --> 00:16:17.637
[Walker] Unlock the door.

338
00:16:17.727 --> 00:16:19.227
-Walker. what’s wrong?
-Unlock the door!

339
00:16:19.353 --> 00:16:20.653
Okay.

340
00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.940
[suspenseful music]

341
00:16:37.788 --> 00:16:39.748
Walker. is everything okay?

342
00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:42.294
Uh-huh. Just please drive.
Let’s go.

343
00:16:50.051 --> 00:16:53.391
[suspenseful music]

344
00:17:14.242 --> 00:17:15.912
Walker?

345
00:17:24.752 --> 00:17:26.132
[sighs]

346
00:17:30.424 --> 00:17:33.394
My gosh.
it’s so good to see you.

347
00:17:33.469 --> 00:17:34.929
Walker. what’s going on?

348
00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:37.314
I just wanted to make sure
that your house

349
00:17:37.431 --> 00:17:39.021
and your car weren’t bugged.

350
00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.390
Bugged. why?

351
00:17:40.476 --> 00:17:42.306
Kate. you don’t understand
how far their reach is.

352
00:17:42.436 --> 00:17:44.556
That’s why
I wanted you to pick me up.

353
00:17:44.647 --> 00:17:46.817
-I had to lose them.
-What...who?

354
00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:50.401
Look. I know
this must be confusing

355
00:17:50.486 --> 00:17:51.776
and even a little scary.

356
00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:54.744
but I promised you
I’d be honest with you.

357
00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:56.744
So let me explain fully.

358
00:17:58.202 --> 00:18:00.002
You know. there wasn’t
a single day that went by

359
00:18:00.121 --> 00:18:01.831
where I wasn’t thinking
about you.

360
00:18:01.956 --> 00:18:04.456
I never believed in fate
or love at first sight.

361
00:18:04.542 --> 00:18:08.252
or any of that kind of stuff.
but with you. it’s different.

362
00:18:08.337 --> 00:18:11.467
I feel like we’re meant
to be together.

363
00:18:11.591 --> 00:18:14.721
But before we go further.
I am...

364
00:18:16.012 --> 00:18:18.472
I have to tell you that my work
can be dangerous.

365
00:18:18.556 --> 00:18:20.516
Dangerous how?

366
00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:22.891
See that painting over there?

367
00:18:22.977 --> 00:18:24.727
That’s an original Bruegel.

368
00:18:24.812 --> 00:18:27.522
I’m sorry. I don’t--
I don’t know much about art.

369
00:18:27.648 --> 00:18:31.278
Pieter Bruegel the Elder.
he was. uh. a Flemish painter

370
00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.650
in the 16th century.
the most significant

371
00:18:33.738 --> 00:18:35.408
Dutch painter
of the Renaissance.

372
00:18:35.489 --> 00:18:38.409
So. it’s valuable?

373
00:18:38.492 --> 00:18:42.622
Uh-hmm. $6.2 million.

374
00:18:42.705 --> 00:18:46.505
The package against the wall
is worth $6 million?

375
00:18:46.626 --> 00:18:48.166
Yeah.

376
00:18:48.294 --> 00:18:50.804
My client thinks it will
look great over his mantle.

377
00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.800
Well. if he can pay that much.
why doesn’t he hire someone

378
00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:55.593
professional to transport it?

379
00:18:55.676 --> 00:18:57.716
I mean. there must be companies
that specialize

380
00:18:57.845 --> 00:18:58.885
in that kind of thing?

381
00:18:59.013 --> 00:19:00.263
Of course. you’re right.

382
00:19:00.348 --> 00:19:02.718
But my clients
don’t follow the usual paths.

383
00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:05.100
Their wealth allows them
to do things their own way.

384
00:19:05.186 --> 00:19:08.896
I still don’t understand
how that’s dangerous.

385
00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:13.528
My client doesn’t want anyone
to know he owns this painting.

386
00:19:13.653 --> 00:19:15.073
Why?

387
00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:16.856
He has his reasons.

388
00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:18.369
Only some of which I know.

389
00:19:18.449 --> 00:19:21.989
But the most important
is I keep it safe.

390
00:19:22.078 --> 00:19:24.788
Well. wouldn’t it be safest
to get the painting to him?

391
00:19:24.872 --> 00:19:27.922
I mean. don’t rich people
have. like. crazy alarm systems?

392
00:19:29.043 --> 00:19:30.463
The thing is.
some very bad people

393
00:19:30.544 --> 00:19:31.964
found out about the purchase.

394
00:19:32.046 --> 00:19:33.666
They’ve staked out his house.

395
00:19:33.756 --> 00:19:35.216
And we’re talking
about dangerous men.

396
00:19:35.341 --> 00:19:37.511
the kind that won’t be stopped
by an alarm system.

397
00:19:37.593 --> 00:19:39.603
I’m even worried
they’re onto me.

398
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.560
Walker. you have to call
the police.

399
00:19:41.681 --> 00:19:43.931
Well. the police have no way
of stopping these guys.

400
00:19:44.058 --> 00:19:45.848
Has to be handled off the grid.

401
00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:47.735
So what are you gonna do?

402
00:19:48.813 --> 00:19:50.363
Well. I need to find
a secure place

403
00:19:50.439 --> 00:19:51.769
to hide the painting.

404
00:19:51.899 --> 00:19:54.399
make sure they don’t find me.

405
00:19:54.527 --> 00:19:56.777
Stay away
until things blow over.

406
00:19:56.904 --> 00:19:58.914
It always does. Eventually.

407
00:19:58.989 --> 00:20:00.529
So this has happened before?

408
00:20:00.616 --> 00:20:03.076
Well. I have my way
of dealing with these things.

409
00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:04.752
Don’t worry.
they won’t get the painting.

410
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:07.160
It’s not the painting
I’m worried about.

411
00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:10.788
Um. I’m so sorry that I dumped

412
00:20:10.918 --> 00:20:12.538
all of this on you so suddenly.

413
00:20:12.628 --> 00:20:14.248
My job affords me
a lavish life.

414
00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:17.468
but it comes
with responsibility.

415
00:20:17.591 --> 00:20:19.181
too much sometimes.

416
00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.600
Look. Walker. I wanna help you.

417
00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:24.562
In any way I can.

418
00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:29.944
You’re so kind. so beautiful.

419
00:20:30.813 --> 00:20:32.613
How’d I get so lucky?

420
00:20:34.275 --> 00:20:35.575
You’re sweet.

421
00:20:38.404 --> 00:20:41.164
You know. you could keep
the painting here.

422
00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:44.241
Kate. uh. I don’t know.

423
00:20:44.326 --> 00:20:46.536
I’d never wanna put you
in any danger.

424
00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:49.040
Well. I mean.
you saw for yourself.

425
00:20:49.123 --> 00:20:50.923
My place isn’t being watched.

426
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.500
It’ll be safe.

427
00:20:53.753 --> 00:20:55.213
Okay.

428
00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:58.127
Okay. But only for a few days.

429
00:20:58.215 --> 00:21:00.965
uh. before I figure
something else out.

430
00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:03.143
Okay.

431
00:21:06.807 --> 00:21:10.057
[dramatic music]

432
00:22:16.377 --> 00:22:18.797
I’m sorry.
I thought you heard me.

433
00:22:18.879 --> 00:22:20.379
Um...

434
00:22:21.215 --> 00:22:23.385
I’m so sorry. I just. um--

435
00:22:23.509 --> 00:22:25.339
You wanted to see?

436
00:22:27.847 --> 00:22:29.717
I understand.

437
00:22:31.976 --> 00:22:35.226
See. the trouble is. the sun...

438
00:22:36.355 --> 00:22:37.685
and air pollutants

439
00:22:37.773 --> 00:22:39.653
can cause irreparable damage.

440
00:22:39.733 --> 00:22:41.073
That’s why it needs
to stay covered

441
00:22:41.193 --> 00:22:43.653
until it’s in
a protective frame.

442
00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.530
But I have another way
of showing you.

443
00:22:53.372 --> 00:22:54.922
So...

444
00:22:59.086 --> 00:23:01.506
-[Kate] Oh. it’s beautiful.
-[Walker] Mm-hmm.

445
00:23:01.589 --> 00:23:04.669
Yeah. he’s mostly known
for his landscapes.

446
00:23:04.758 --> 00:23:08.508
He also does pictures
and prints of peasants.

447
00:23:08.596 --> 00:23:12.016
Can you feel the life
and the movement?

448
00:23:12.725 --> 00:23:14.985
I love all the little vignettes

449
00:23:15.102 --> 00:23:17.352
and characters.

450
00:23:18.105 --> 00:23:20.225
I’m glad you appreciate it.

451
00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:33.624
[sighs]

452
00:23:33.746 --> 00:23:35.326
I’m so sorry.

453
00:23:35.456 --> 00:23:37.456
I should’ve just asked.

454
00:23:37.541 --> 00:23:38.881
No.

455
00:23:38.959 --> 00:23:41.129
You have every right
to be curious.

456
00:23:41.211 --> 00:23:43.591
I just hope with time

457
00:23:43.672 --> 00:23:45.382
you’ll come to trust me more.

458
00:23:45.466 --> 00:23:46.836
I will.

459
00:23:46.967 --> 00:23:48.587
I do.

460
00:23:49.803 --> 00:23:51.143
Shall we go to bed?

461
00:23:51.263 --> 00:23:53.603
-Yes.
-Hmm.

462
00:23:57.436 --> 00:24:00.726
[tense music]

463
00:24:06.028 --> 00:24:08.488
[indistinct crowd chattering]

464
00:24:08.614 --> 00:24:11.074
Where is he? I’m starving.

465
00:24:11.158 --> 00:24:14.078
He said he’ll be here
in a few minutes.

466
00:24:14.161 --> 00:24:15.791
He’s walking form the hotel.

467
00:24:15.871 --> 00:24:17.831
Tell me again
why he lives at a hotel.

468
00:24:17.915 --> 00:24:20.545
He doesn’t live there.

469
00:24:20.668 --> 00:24:22.498
Look. he’s on the road so much
it doesn’t make sense

470
00:24:22.628 --> 00:24:23.708
to have something permanent.

471
00:24:23.837 --> 00:24:25.337
A hotel is much easier.

472
00:24:25.422 --> 00:24:29.262
Hmm. seems a little odd to me.
to not have a home.

473
00:24:29.343 --> 00:24:30.933
We work in real estate. Viv.

474
00:24:31.011 --> 00:24:33.101
Of course
it doesn’t make sense to us.

475
00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.970
-Good point.
-Look.

476
00:24:35.057 --> 00:24:37.807
Walker isn’t like anyone
I have ever met.

477
00:24:37.893 --> 00:24:40.403
Yeah. that’s what’s got
my spidey sense tingling.

478
00:24:40.521 --> 00:24:42.611
But that’s why I like him.

479
00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:45.480
He doesn’t follow conventions.

480
00:24:46.193 --> 00:24:47.903
Can you give him a chance
for me?

481
00:24:48.028 --> 00:24:50.528
-Please?
-Okay.

482
00:24:52.866 --> 00:24:55.696
-Oh. there he is.
-[Walker] Hey.

483
00:25:04.044 --> 00:25:06.254
I am so sorry. I. uh...

484
00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:10.050
I thought it’d be faster to walk
instead of waiting for a cab.

485
00:25:10.175 --> 00:25:11.505
Did you--did you wait long?

486
00:25:11.593 --> 00:25:14.303
Uh. just enough time
to have a glass of wine

487
00:25:14.388 --> 00:25:15.428
and unwind.

488
00:25:15.556 --> 00:25:17.556
Yeah? Busy day?

489
00:25:17.641 --> 00:25:18.981
Uh. two house showings.

490
00:25:19.059 --> 00:25:21.309
Wow. You’re a rock star. babe.

491
00:25:24.064 --> 00:25:25.654
Uh. oh. I’m so sorry.

492
00:25:25.733 --> 00:25:27.403
Uh. Walker. this is Vivian.

493
00:25:27.484 --> 00:25:30.324
Vivian. I feel like I know you.
I’ve heard so much about you.

494
00:25:30.404 --> 00:25:31.864
Likewise.

495
00:25:31.947 --> 00:25:34.817
Well. ladies. I insist
we have the antipasto.

496
00:25:34.908 --> 00:25:37.578
It’s the best in the city.

497
00:25:41.248 --> 00:25:44.168
You’re absolutely right.
Uh. thank you.

498
00:25:44.251 --> 00:25:47.001
You know. art dealers tend
to specialize in modern art

499
00:25:47.087 --> 00:25:48.837
because it tends
to be more affordable

500
00:25:48.922 --> 00:25:50.592
and they’re still producing.

501
00:25:50.716 --> 00:25:52.176
so there’s a steady supply.

502
00:25:52.259 --> 00:25:53.509
But not you. huh?

503
00:25:53.594 --> 00:25:55.014
I’m a bit of an outlier.

504
00:25:55.095 --> 00:25:56.555
I just...I don’t get it.

505
00:25:56.638 --> 00:25:59.388
Like. what’s people’s obsession
with paint splatters?

506
00:25:59.475 --> 00:26:01.775
So you’re not
a Jackson Pollock fan?

507
00:26:01.852 --> 00:26:03.732
No. No. I. uh...

508
00:26:03.812 --> 00:26:06.022
I guess I have
more traditional tastes.

509
00:26:06.106 --> 00:26:09.566
I appreciate natural beauty.

510
00:26:10.736 --> 00:26:14.446
the kind that steals your heart
when you gaze at it.

511
00:26:16.116 --> 00:26:19.076
You know. I used to live
in New York down in Soho.

512
00:26:19.161 --> 00:26:21.411
Um. I’m assuming
you spent a lot of time in Soho

513
00:26:21.497 --> 00:26:23.247
because of all the galleries.

514
00:26:23.332 --> 00:26:24.832
Oh. for sure. Yeah.

515
00:26:24.958 --> 00:26:27.168
This lovely lady will tell you
I travel the country.

516
00:26:27.294 --> 00:26:28.714
not to mention the world.

517
00:26:28.796 --> 00:26:32.376
Well. I used to live right above
a pretty famous gallery.

518
00:26:32.466 --> 00:26:34.176
The Crabelle.
You’ve heard of it?

519
00:26:34.301 --> 00:26:35.681
Sure.

520
00:26:35.803 --> 00:26:37.853
They used to have
a lot of events.

521
00:26:37.971 --> 00:26:39.561
some host art openings.

522
00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.310
I never went to any. but...

523
00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:43.143
Yeah. Well. you know.
when you’re in the business.

524
00:26:43.227 --> 00:26:45.847
those kinds of things
tend to get pretty tedious.

525
00:26:45.979 --> 00:26:47.859
All right. guys.
Can I get you anything else?

526
00:26:47.981 --> 00:26:49.071
Anything else?

527
00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:50.359
-No. I’m good.
-Thank you.

528
00:26:50.484 --> 00:26:51.784
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

529
00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:53.570
-Just the check. please.
-Here you go.

530
00:26:53.654 --> 00:26:54.954
Thank you.

531
00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:56.990
All right.

532
00:26:57.116 --> 00:26:59.236
-Here you go.
-Oh. no.

533
00:26:59.326 --> 00:27:01.326
I really wanted
to take you guys out.

534
00:27:01.411 --> 00:27:04.251
No. no. Vivian. please. I...
it’s the least I can do.

535
00:27:04.331 --> 00:27:06.961
It’s my way of apologizing
for being late.

536
00:27:07.042 --> 00:27:08.842
Well. I’ll at least get the tip.

537
00:27:08.961 --> 00:27:12.211
No. no. Gift isn’t really a gift
if it’s only partial.

538
00:27:12.339 --> 00:27:14.299
And it’s really great
to finally meet you

539
00:27:14.383 --> 00:27:17.343
’cause I intend
to spend a lot of time

540
00:27:17.427 --> 00:27:19.137
with this special lady.

541
00:27:20.514 --> 00:27:22.434
Hi. Um. sir. I’m so sorry.

542
00:27:22.516 --> 00:27:24.176
but your credit card
was declined.

543
00:27:24.268 --> 00:27:26.518
Uh. do you have another
that you’d like to use?

544
00:27:26.645 --> 00:27:27.685
Uh. no. no. You know what?

545
00:27:27.771 --> 00:27:29.481
I’ll do--I’ll do cash.

546
00:27:29.565 --> 00:27:31.275
Uh. I’ll tell you what.
If I had a nickel

547
00:27:31.358 --> 00:27:32.728
for every time this happened.

548
00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.280
I mean. I get these
credit card companies

549
00:27:34.361 --> 00:27:36.781
wanna prevent fraud.
but seriously.

550
00:27:36.864 --> 00:27:38.374
some of us travel.

551
00:27:39.199 --> 00:27:40.029
Keep the change.

552
00:27:40.159 --> 00:27:41.829
Oh. Thank you.

553
00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:44.700
Uh. you guys
have a wonderful night.

554
00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:46.460
Ladies. shall we?

555
00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:48.040
Yeah.

556
00:27:56.133 --> 00:27:58.553
-Thank you.
-[Walker] Mm-hmm.

557
00:28:01.263 --> 00:28:03.473
Oh. my God. I am so happy

558
00:28:03.557 --> 00:28:04.717
that you got to meet Vivian.

559
00:28:04.808 --> 00:28:07.188
I think she liked you.

560
00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:09.519
Kate. there’s no reason to lie.

561
00:28:09.605 --> 00:28:13.405
Look. I know how she can
come off as abrasive.

562
00:28:13.483 --> 00:28:14.823
She’s just protective.

563
00:28:14.902 --> 00:28:17.112
Well. I felt
like she was testing me.

564
00:28:17.237 --> 00:28:19.317
Well. she was.

565
00:28:19.406 --> 00:28:21.316
You were hardly intimidated.

566
00:28:21.408 --> 00:28:24.238
Well. no. Not with you
by my side. I wasn’t.

567
00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:27.000
Look. um. Vivian and I.

568
00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:30.210
we’ve been through
thick and thin.

569
00:28:30.292 --> 00:28:31.792
We’d do anything for each other.

570
00:28:31.919 --> 00:28:34.209
You’re lucky to have that.

571
00:28:38.008 --> 00:28:39.428
What?

572
00:28:42.721 --> 00:28:44.311
Hmm?

573
00:28:44.431 --> 00:28:46.311
Where’d you go?

574
00:28:46.433 --> 00:28:48.563
Nowhere. I. um...

575
00:28:48.644 --> 00:28:50.904
Walker. I can tell
there’s something wrong.

576
00:28:51.939 --> 00:28:54.609
You remember when my credit card
was declined?

577
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:58.530
Yeah.

578
00:28:58.612 --> 00:29:01.612
Well. that wasn’t
because I was traveling.

579
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.450
That was the criminals
that I told you about.

580
00:29:04.576 --> 00:29:06.196
They’ve been tracking
my purchases

581
00:29:06.286 --> 00:29:07.826
to try to figure out
my whereabouts.

582
00:29:07.955 --> 00:29:09.915
And for security reasons.

583
00:29:09.998 --> 00:29:11.248
I had to stop my cards.

584
00:29:11.333 --> 00:29:13.883
I totally forgot
when I handed it over.

585
00:29:13.961 --> 00:29:16.051
Well. do they know
where you are now?

586
00:29:16.129 --> 00:29:18.049
No. Not yet.

587
00:29:18.131 --> 00:29:21.301
Walker. you need
to go to the police.

588
00:29:21.426 --> 00:29:23.006
I told you.
There’s nothing they can do.

589
00:29:23.136 --> 00:29:25.096
It’s just gonna backfire.

590
00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:28.600
Okay. Then you hide
out here with me

591
00:29:28.684 --> 00:29:30.274
until they give up.

592
00:29:31.061 --> 00:29:33.941
Man. I wish I could.
But I have clients.

593
00:29:34.022 --> 00:29:35.272
I have business to attend to.

594
00:29:35.357 --> 00:29:37.277
And if you travel.
they’ll find you.

595
00:29:37.359 --> 00:29:39.319
Well. I do have cash
that I can use.

596
00:29:39.444 --> 00:29:41.864
But at some point.
that’s gonna run out.

597
00:29:41.989 --> 00:29:44.779
And if I withdraw.
then they’ll track me.

598
00:29:45.659 --> 00:29:47.829
-Okay.
-If I could just get access

599
00:29:47.911 --> 00:29:50.371
to a credit card
for. like. a week or two.

600
00:29:50.497 --> 00:29:52.787
In the past.
my business associates did that.

601
00:29:52.874 --> 00:29:56.004
but now they’re onto them. too.

602
00:29:56.837 --> 00:29:58.507
I could give you my card.

603
00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:01.880
Wait. You’d lend me one?

604
00:30:02.009 --> 00:30:03.179
Sure.

605
00:30:03.302 --> 00:30:05.012
I. um...

606
00:30:16.023 --> 00:30:18.443
What is this?

607
00:30:18.525 --> 00:30:20.315
$10.000.

608
00:30:20.402 --> 00:30:22.492
Just to put your mind at ease.

609
00:30:23.238 --> 00:30:25.068
See it as a down payment.

610
00:30:25.198 --> 00:30:27.328
Why don’t you use this
instead of my card?

611
00:30:27.409 --> 00:30:30.619
Well. there’s many things
you can only do on credit.

612
00:30:33.874 --> 00:30:35.464
Well. I don’t need this.

613
00:30:35.542 --> 00:30:37.922
No. no. I want you to have it.

614
00:30:38.045 --> 00:30:40.845
At the very least.
just hold onto it for me.

615
00:30:42.132 --> 00:30:43.382
Okay.

616
00:30:44.217 --> 00:30:45.837
Kate. you’re the best.

617
00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:48.758
The kind of woman
I could build a life with.

618
00:30:48.889 --> 00:30:52.059
I really think we make
an amazing team. don’t you?

619
00:30:52.142 --> 00:30:54.522
Well. yeah.

620
00:30:55.687 --> 00:30:58.687
So do you think I could get
that card from you now?

621
00:30:59.566 --> 00:31:00.976
Oh. um. well. actually.

622
00:31:01.068 --> 00:31:03.568
I also need to use it. so...

623
00:31:03.695 --> 00:31:05.815
Well. maybe you could open
a new account

624
00:31:05.906 --> 00:31:08.776
and that way
we just keep charges separate.

625
00:31:08.909 --> 00:31:10.199
Okay.

626
00:31:10.952 --> 00:31:12.332
Do you think you could...

627
00:31:12.412 --> 00:31:14.002
take care of it first thing
in the morning?

628
00:31:14.081 --> 00:31:15.541
It’s just that I need

629
00:31:15.624 --> 00:31:17.254
to keep my business running.

630
00:31:17.334 --> 00:31:20.804
I think a $30.000 limit
should be--should be good.

631
00:31:20.921 --> 00:31:23.591
Oh. wow. Um...

632
00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:25.880
okay. sure.

633
00:31:25.967 --> 00:31:27.887
Kate. you’re amazing.

634
00:31:29.763 --> 00:31:31.563
Now. let’s get some rest. hmm?

635
00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:33.180
Mm-hmm.

636
00:31:51.493 --> 00:31:53.793
-Hey.
-Hey.

637
00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:56.460
I thought I would hear from you
last night after dinner.

638
00:31:56.581 --> 00:32:00.291
Uh. we were a little busy.

639
00:32:02.295 --> 00:32:03.835
So what’d you think?

640
00:32:03.964 --> 00:32:05.844
Well...

641
00:32:05.966 --> 00:32:07.466
I knew it. You don’t like him.

642
00:32:08.301 --> 00:32:10.851
-Well. he’s certainly charming.
-Come on. Viv.

643
00:32:10.971 --> 00:32:13.471
It’s never been like you
to beat around the bush.

644
00:32:13.557 --> 00:32:16.227
I can tell how much
you like him. Kate.

645
00:32:17.018 --> 00:32:19.228
-But he’s a liar.
-Huh?

646
00:32:19.312 --> 00:32:22.272
You know the gallery I said
I lived above in New York?

647
00:32:22.357 --> 00:32:23.937
The one that Walker
said he knew well.

648
00:32:24.025 --> 00:32:25.685
Yeah. what about it?

649
00:32:25.819 --> 00:32:27.949
The Crabelle Gallery
doesn’t exist.

650
00:32:28.029 --> 00:32:30.319
-I made it up.
-Uh...

651
00:32:31.491 --> 00:32:32.701
um. okay.

652
00:32:32.826 --> 00:32:35.156
-What does that prove?
-That he lies.

653
00:32:35.287 --> 00:32:37.367
-He said he knew it.
-[Kate] Come on. Viv.

654
00:32:37.497 --> 00:32:39.037
Maybe he got the name wrong

655
00:32:39.166 --> 00:32:41.376
or. God forbid.
he was embarrassed

656
00:32:41.501 --> 00:32:44.001
that he didn’t know the name
of a famous art gallery

657
00:32:44.129 --> 00:32:45.209
and he just played it off.

658
00:32:45.338 --> 00:32:46.758
Are you listening to yourself?

659
00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:49.090
You’re making excuses for him.

660
00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:51.970
You Googled him. right?

661
00:32:52.053 --> 00:32:53.513
-Of course.
-Okay.

662
00:32:53.638 --> 00:32:55.058
So then.

663
00:32:55.182 --> 00:32:57.812
you saw all of these.

664
00:32:59.728 --> 00:33:02.648
Yeah. anybody can create
a website.

665
00:33:03.899 --> 00:33:05.069
Okay.

666
00:33:05.192 --> 00:33:08.032
Well. what about all
of these articles

667
00:33:08.153 --> 00:33:09.323
saying how well-respected

668
00:33:09.404 --> 00:33:11.034
and successful he is
in the art world?

669
00:33:11.114 --> 00:33:13.574
I mean. can anybody
get these published?

670
00:33:14.409 --> 00:33:16.079
And what about
his social media accounts?

671
00:33:16.203 --> 00:33:18.833
I mean. unless
he’s test driving expensive cars

672
00:33:18.914 --> 00:33:20.834
and great with Photoshop.

673
00:33:20.916 --> 00:33:22.626
he’s got a lot of money.

674
00:33:24.044 --> 00:33:27.304
And he gave me 10 grand in cash.

675
00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:29.260
Oh. God. He’s a drug dealer!

676
00:33:29.382 --> 00:33:32.512
No. no. no!
It was from one of his clients.

677
00:33:32.594 --> 00:33:34.354
Kate. does he have you involved

678
00:33:34.429 --> 00:33:36.679
in something shady?

679
00:33:36.765 --> 00:33:39.105
No. Look. Vivian.
I’m just trying to say

680
00:33:39.226 --> 00:33:40.886
that he lives
in a world of money

681
00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:42.559
that we can’t understand.

682
00:33:42.687 --> 00:33:44.607
To him. 10 grand
isn’t a big deal.

683
00:33:44.731 --> 00:33:46.361
I think
you’re so head over heels

684
00:33:46.441 --> 00:33:48.821
that you don’t see
the red flags.

685
00:33:48.902 --> 00:33:52.362
And I think that I just have
a little more faith in people.

686
00:33:52.447 --> 00:33:55.657
You should try it.
It’s the only way to find love.

687
00:33:56.952 --> 00:33:58.582
Look. I get it.

688
00:33:58.703 --> 00:34:00.203
You don’t trust Walker.

689
00:34:00.288 --> 00:34:04.078
But can you please just try
to trust me?

690
00:34:05.293 --> 00:34:07.503
I just hope you know
what you’re doing.

691
00:34:12.926 --> 00:34:16.136
Do you still wanna try
that little Italian place?

692
00:34:16.263 --> 00:34:19.643
[Walker] Uh. well. I. um...

693
00:34:19.766 --> 00:34:22.596
We have plans tonight. don’t we?

694
00:34:22.686 --> 00:34:23.896
[Walker] Yeah. of course.

695
00:34:23.979 --> 00:34:25.649
It’s just...

696
00:34:25.772 --> 00:34:26.982
you know. actually.
would you mind

697
00:34:27.107 --> 00:34:28.977
if I came over to your place

698
00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:31.279
and we just...we ordered in?

699
00:34:31.361 --> 00:34:33.071
No. of course not.

700
00:34:33.154 --> 00:34:35.624
[Walker] Great. I’ll. uh...
I’ll be there soon.

701
00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:39.040
Just don’t scream
when you see me.

702
00:34:39.953 --> 00:34:42.123
Wait. What? Why?

703
00:34:42.205 --> 00:34:43.495
[phone beeps]

704
00:34:43.623 --> 00:34:45.333
Walker?

705
00:34:45.458 --> 00:34:46.918
Walker?

706
00:34:51.881 --> 00:34:55.381
[exhales heavily]

707
00:34:56.928 --> 00:34:59.308
[knocks on door]

708
00:35:01.474 --> 00:35:03.104
[Kate] Oh. my God!

709
00:35:06.521 --> 00:35:08.611
-Hey.
-Are you okay?

710
00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:10.650
Yeah. Trust me.
I’ve been much worse.

711
00:35:10.734 --> 00:35:12.864
Okay.
Um. let’s get you something

712
00:35:12.986 --> 00:35:14.486
for the swelling.

713
00:35:23.788 --> 00:35:25.618
What happened?

714
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.500
The guys jumped me as soon
as I walked out of the hotel.

715
00:35:30.587 --> 00:35:31.957
What? Who did?

716
00:35:32.047 --> 00:35:33.967
The criminals I told you about.

717
00:35:34.049 --> 00:35:36.469
Oh. my God.

718
00:35:36.551 --> 00:35:38.221
Don’t worry. I’m...

719
00:35:39.054 --> 00:35:41.684
I’m fine. I got away.

720
00:35:41.806 --> 00:35:44.386
I was hiding in a Starbucks
when you called.

721
00:35:45.268 --> 00:35:47.398
I made sure
they didn’t follow me here.

722
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.060
I mean. if they know
where you’ve been staying.

723
00:35:49.189 --> 00:35:51.269
they must also know
who you’ve been seeing.

724
00:35:51.358 --> 00:35:53.188
I was careful to come by foot.

725
00:35:53.318 --> 00:35:55.028
I took detours.

726
00:35:55.153 --> 00:35:58.323
I had to make sure
no one was following me.

727
00:35:58.406 --> 00:36:00.486
There’s no way
they could trace me here.

728
00:36:00.575 --> 00:36:02.075
But how can you be sure?

729
00:36:02.202 --> 00:36:04.792
I mean. Walker. look at you.

730
00:36:04.871 --> 00:36:07.751
Kate. I’m never gonna let
anything happen to you.

731
00:36:07.874 --> 00:36:09.214
I promise.

732
00:36:12.712 --> 00:36:15.922
-We need to go to the cops.
-No. Kate. Cops just...

733
00:36:16.049 --> 00:36:18.679
I mean. they bring
too many questions.

734
00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:19.970
And if my clients think

735
00:36:20.053 --> 00:36:22.263
that they can’t rely
on my discretion.

736
00:36:22.389 --> 00:36:25.179
no matter what happens.
this is all over for me.

737
00:36:26.309 --> 00:36:29.599
-This is crazy.
-I know.

738
00:36:29.729 --> 00:36:31.939
Once they realize
they can’t find the painting.

739
00:36:32.065 --> 00:36:33.735
it should all stop.

740
00:36:34.984 --> 00:36:36.864
But I might have to go away
for a while.

741
00:36:36.945 --> 00:36:38.405
What? Where?

742
00:36:38.488 --> 00:36:39.778
I don’t know.

743
00:36:39.906 --> 00:36:42.066
Um. is it a headache?

744
00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.830
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay.

745
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:46.250
Uh. let me get something for it.

746
00:36:53.253 --> 00:36:55.713
-Here. baby.
-Thank you.

747
00:36:57.132 --> 00:37:00.382
Ibuprofen. is this all you have?

748
00:37:01.177 --> 00:37:02.427
Yeah.

749
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:06.020
I’m allergic. but no worries.
I’ll. uh...

750
00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:08.310
I’ll just go
to the convenience store.

751
00:37:08.435 --> 00:37:10.735
-It’s. like. five minutes away.
-What? No. No.

752
00:37:10.812 --> 00:37:13.362
Um. I will go. you stay here.

753
00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.860
and I’m gonna be back. okay?

754
00:37:14.941 --> 00:37:17.781
-Are you sure?
-[Kate] Yes. Absolutely.

755
00:37:18.945 --> 00:37:20.065
Thank you.

756
00:37:20.155 --> 00:37:22.075
Of course.

757
00:37:35.628 --> 00:37:38.918
[suspenseful music]

758
00:37:51.603 --> 00:37:53.063
[camera shutter clicks]

759
00:37:56.149 --> 00:37:58.989
[suspenseful music]

760
00:38:04.991 --> 00:38:07.241
[car engine revving]

761
00:38:18.338 --> 00:38:19.838
[suspenseful music]

762
00:38:19.964 --> 00:38:21.594
[door opening]

763
00:38:28.264 --> 00:38:29.814
Hi.

764
00:38:31.351 --> 00:38:32.731
Okay.

765
00:38:33.895 --> 00:38:35.865
-That was quick.
-[Kate] Yeah.

766
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.320
I. uh. forgot I had some aspirin
in my glove compartment.

767
00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.900
So take three of those.
That’s what I do

768
00:38:41.027 --> 00:38:43.607
when I have
a really bad headache.

769
00:38:43.696 --> 00:38:45.106
Could you give me some water?

770
00:38:45.198 --> 00:38:47.868
Oh. yeah. Of course.

771
00:39:02.048 --> 00:39:04.838
-Thank you.
-[Kate] Of course.

772
00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.890
Maybe I should take you
to the hospital.

773
00:39:10.014 --> 00:39:11.684
Uh-uh.

774
00:39:12.934 --> 00:39:15.104
No. I’ve had much worse.

775
00:39:15.228 --> 00:39:16.768
Besides I’m a quick healer.

776
00:39:16.896 --> 00:39:18.646
You could have a concussion.

777
00:39:18.731 --> 00:39:21.981
I don’t. And even if I did.
do you know what they’d tell me?

778
00:39:22.735 --> 00:39:24.315
"Go home and rest."

779
00:39:25.071 --> 00:39:26.241
Yeah. maybe I should go.

780
00:39:26.322 --> 00:39:28.532
You shouldn’t have
to play nurse.

781
00:39:28.616 --> 00:39:30.866
Are you crazy?
Where are you gonna go?

782
00:39:30.952 --> 00:39:32.832
I don’t know. Some...

783
00:39:32.912 --> 00:39:34.622
hotel or something.

784
00:39:34.747 --> 00:39:37.117
No. you are going to stay here

785
00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:38.630
whether you like it or not.

786
00:39:38.751 --> 00:39:40.251
at least for tonight. Okay?

787
00:39:40.378 --> 00:39:42.298
Okay. Doctor.

788
00:39:51.931 --> 00:39:52.891
Walker?

789
00:39:52.974 --> 00:39:54.314
Hmm?

790
00:39:54.434 --> 00:39:57.144
I need to ask you something.

791
00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:58.730
Ask away.

792
00:39:59.439 --> 00:40:01.019
The Crabelle Gallery.

793
00:40:01.107 --> 00:40:02.727
Yeah. what about it?

794
00:40:02.817 --> 00:40:05.317
[Kate] It doesn’t exist.

795
00:40:06.112 --> 00:40:07.702
I know.

796
00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:09.240
You do?

797
00:40:09.324 --> 00:40:11.584
So why didn’t you say anything?

798
00:40:11.659 --> 00:40:13.619
Well. I didn’t wanna come
across like I’m a jerk.

799
00:40:13.703 --> 00:40:17.083
I don’t wanna embarrass Vivian
because she got the name wrong.

800
00:40:17.165 --> 00:40:19.175
Why? Is something wrong?

801
00:40:19.292 --> 00:40:20.882
No. No.

802
00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.290
No. nothing at all.

803
00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.000
Hmm.

804
00:40:26.758 --> 00:40:28.218
Oh.

805
00:40:40.188 --> 00:40:42.268
Your card. I was only able

806
00:40:42.357 --> 00:40:45.147
to get a $15.000 credit limit
on it.

807
00:40:45.234 --> 00:40:46.824
So. I hope that’s okay.

808
00:40:46.903 --> 00:40:48.653
Kate. this is...

809
00:40:49.489 --> 00:40:50.569
thank you.

810
00:40:50.657 --> 00:40:53.527
Of course. I’m happy to help.

811
00:40:55.995 --> 00:40:59.535
How about I go get us something
to eat?

812
00:40:59.666 --> 00:41:01.576
That sounds great.

813
00:41:31.322 --> 00:41:32.412
Yeah.

814
00:41:32.532 --> 00:41:34.332
No. I’ve got that sorted.

815
00:41:35.118 --> 00:41:37.038
Absolutely. yeah.

816
00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:38.331
Right.

817
00:41:38.413 --> 00:41:39.913
In about seven days.

818
00:41:40.039 --> 00:41:41.209
Okay.

819
00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:43.000
Sorry. got to go.

820
00:41:43.084 --> 00:41:45.094
Okay. Bye.

821
00:41:45.712 --> 00:41:47.512
I’m sorry. Did I wake you?

822
00:41:47.588 --> 00:41:49.588
-What’s going on?
-Kate. listen to me.

823
00:41:49.716 --> 00:41:51.466
I have to leave the country
immediately.

824
00:41:51.551 --> 00:41:53.801
-What?
-Just a few days.

825
00:41:53.886 --> 00:41:55.296
a week at the most.

826
00:41:55.388 --> 00:41:56.678
Why? Who was that?

827
00:41:56.764 --> 00:41:58.894
That’s a client of mine. I...

828
00:41:58.975 --> 00:42:00.355
things developed and I just...

829
00:42:00.435 --> 00:42:02.275
I can’t get into it right now.

830
00:42:02.395 --> 00:42:03.655
Okay.

831
00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:05.400
But I have a favor to ask you.

832
00:42:05.481 --> 00:42:07.981
A really big favor.
but I’m gonna make it up to you.

833
00:42:08.067 --> 00:42:09.437
I swear.

834
00:42:09.569 --> 00:42:12.239
I have 20.000 in cash
back at the hotel.

835
00:42:12.321 --> 00:42:14.241
but I can’t get to it.

836
00:42:14.323 --> 00:42:15.783
Oh. well...

837
00:42:15.908 --> 00:42:19.448
So. when your bank opens.
how much could you take out?

838
00:42:19.579 --> 00:42:22.079
Well. I only have
a couple thousand

839
00:42:22.206 --> 00:42:24.246
-in my checking.
-Mm-hmm.

840
00:42:24.333 --> 00:42:26.343
What about savings?

841
00:42:26.419 --> 00:42:28.499
Uh. retirement funds.
any other kind of...

842
00:42:28.588 --> 00:42:30.588
-I can. but--
-I’ll pay you back.

843
00:42:30.715 --> 00:42:33.555
And I...the moment I get back.
I promise.

844
00:42:33.634 --> 00:42:35.054
I’ll pay you back with interest.

845
00:42:35.136 --> 00:42:36.966
No. you don’t need to do that.

846
00:42:37.096 --> 00:42:38.846
No. I want to.

847
00:42:38.931 --> 00:42:40.521
I wanna take care of you always.

848
00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:44.020
Okay. But what do I do if...

849
00:42:44.103 --> 00:42:45.853
If what?

850
00:42:45.938 --> 00:42:47.688
If something happens to you?

851
00:42:47.774 --> 00:42:51.444
Well. I thought about that...

852
00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:56.740
and that’s why
I had this drawn up.

853
00:43:00.286 --> 00:43:02.326
Oh. my God. Is this your will?

854
00:43:02.455 --> 00:43:05.875
If anything ever happens to me.
everything I have is yours.

855
00:43:05.958 --> 00:43:07.958
This is not necessary.

856
00:43:08.086 --> 00:43:11.126
Kate. I mean it when I say
I wanna take care of you.

857
00:43:11.214 --> 00:43:14.054
You’re the best thing
that’s ever happened to me.

858
00:43:20.014 --> 00:43:21.724
So. we’ll go to the bank
this morning?

859
00:43:21.808 --> 00:43:23.138
Yeah.

860
00:43:23.976 --> 00:43:25.306
Great.

861
00:43:50.336 --> 00:43:51.706
[Vivian] Hey.

862
00:43:51.838 --> 00:43:52.708
Hi.

863
00:43:52.839 --> 00:43:54.339
Everything okay?

864
00:43:54.423 --> 00:43:56.343
Yeah. fine. Why?

865
00:43:56.425 --> 00:43:59.045
Because it’s just not like you
to come in so late

866
00:43:59.178 --> 00:44:01.598
and not at least text me.

867
00:44:01.681 --> 00:44:05.021
I had an errand to run
first thing.

868
00:44:05.893 --> 00:44:07.483
You look pretty tired.

869
00:44:07.562 --> 00:44:08.652
Thanks. Viv.

870
00:44:08.729 --> 00:44:11.149
Hey. honesty is the best policy.

871
00:44:12.108 --> 00:44:13.938
So you’re gonna tell me
what’s going on?

872
00:44:14.026 --> 00:44:15.936
I just didn’t sleep much
last night.

873
00:44:16.028 --> 00:44:17.568
Trouble with Walker?

874
00:44:17.697 --> 00:44:19.947
No. We’re fine. actually.

875
00:44:20.032 --> 00:44:21.332
Best we’ve ever been.

876
00:44:21.409 --> 00:44:23.369
-Okay.
-Uh-hmm.

877
00:44:23.452 --> 00:44:26.502
All right.
Hope you get some sleep tonight.

878
00:44:33.671 --> 00:44:35.551
[sighs]

879
00:44:43.931 --> 00:44:47.691
[suspenseful music]

880
00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:09.040
[indistinct chatter]

881
00:45:25.431 --> 00:45:26.771
Eliza?

882
00:45:28.517 --> 00:45:30.267
Eliza Porter?

883
00:45:31.604 --> 00:45:33.614
I’m Kate Burns.

884
00:45:33.731 --> 00:45:36.441
We’ve never officially met.
but...

885
00:45:37.693 --> 00:45:40.493
we have a mutual friend.

886
00:45:40.613 --> 00:45:42.953
Walker Stevenson.

887
00:45:45.993 --> 00:45:47.583
How did you find me?

888
00:45:47.662 --> 00:45:50.912
Uh. you were drinking
one of those cappuccinos

889
00:45:50.998 --> 00:45:52.918
in one of your posts.

890
00:45:54.794 --> 00:45:56.044
I gotta give you credit.

891
00:45:56.128 --> 00:45:57.878
I mean.
most girls on a first date

892
00:45:57.964 --> 00:46:00.094
if they see the guy
talking to his ex.

893
00:46:00.174 --> 00:46:02.514
they would run for the hills.

894
00:46:02.635 --> 00:46:04.805
[laughs] Yeah.

895
00:46:04.929 --> 00:46:07.559
I guess I don’t scare
that easily.

896
00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:09.730
Can I ask what you guys
were talking about.

897
00:46:09.809 --> 00:46:12.439
if you don’t mind me asking?

898
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:16.320
Well. um...

899
00:46:19.193 --> 00:46:20.903
it’s a bit embarrassing.

900
00:46:21.654 --> 00:46:24.624
I was begging him
to take me back.

901
00:46:24.699 --> 00:46:27.159
Yeah. I had broken things off.

902
00:46:27.994 --> 00:46:30.374
but then regretted it.
so I showed up

903
00:46:30.496 --> 00:46:33.286
and asked him
to give us another chance.

904
00:46:34.917 --> 00:46:37.837
Can I ask why
you broke things off?

905
00:46:38.754 --> 00:46:40.764
Well. you know how Walker lives.

906
00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:44.180
I never saw him for more than
a couple days at a time

907
00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:46.550
and he was always
heading off somewhere.

908
00:46:46.679 --> 00:46:48.139
Yeah.

909
00:46:48.222 --> 00:46:53.102
Is that why you searched me out.
to commiserate?

910
00:46:53.185 --> 00:46:55.265
I guess...

911
00:46:55.354 --> 00:46:57.524
I guess I just wondered if--

912
00:46:57.606 --> 00:46:59.016
If he’s the real deal?

913
00:46:59.150 --> 00:47:00.650
Yeah.

914
00:47:00.735 --> 00:47:02.495
He seems too good to be true.

915
00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:03.990
[chuckles]

916
00:47:04.071 --> 00:47:08.871
So did he ever take you
with him on these trips?

917
00:47:08.951 --> 00:47:11.501
Oh. uh. he offered.

918
00:47:11.579 --> 00:47:14.869
but I have a job
that requires me

919
00:47:14.999 --> 00:47:17.459
to show up
at an office every day.

920
00:47:17.543 --> 00:47:19.553
so I just couldn’t swing it.

921
00:47:19.628 --> 00:47:23.378
So you do believe that
he’s an art consultant then?

922
00:47:23.466 --> 00:47:27.796
Oh. I saw some pretty
amazing paintings.

923
00:47:27.887 --> 00:47:29.807
the kind that you see
in museums.

924
00:47:29.889 --> 00:47:32.389
And I got to meet
some of his clients.

925
00:47:33.893 --> 00:47:35.233
Look. Walker is a catch.

926
00:47:35.353 --> 00:47:37.903
He’s smart.
He’s sexy.

927
00:47:38.773 --> 00:47:40.193
He’s successful.

928
00:47:40.274 --> 00:47:41.694
He’s a true gentleman.

929
00:47:41.776 --> 00:47:44.816
I mean. the entire time
that we were together.

930
00:47:44.904 --> 00:47:47.414
he treated me like a queen.

931
00:47:48.407 --> 00:47:51.027
I hear a but coming.

932
00:47:52.703 --> 00:47:55.373
But with him. you need to be
able to go with the flow.

933
00:47:55.456 --> 00:47:57.286
And I just...
I didn’t want to anymore.

934
00:47:57.416 --> 00:48:00.166
And I thought that
I was making the right decision

935
00:48:00.252 --> 00:48:03.462
by breaking things off.
but I realized that

936
00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:07.759
there aren’t any other
Walker Stevensons out there.

937
00:48:09.303 --> 00:48:10.553
He’s one of a kind.

938
00:48:10.638 --> 00:48:12.678
You should count yourself lucky.

939
00:48:14.517 --> 00:48:16.227
[clears throat]

940
00:48:23.776 --> 00:48:27.106
[suspenseful music]

941
00:48:54.974 --> 00:48:57.144
[doorbell rings]

942
00:49:19.832 --> 00:49:20.922
Can I help you?

943
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.830
-Katherine Burns?
-Yes.

944
00:49:22.918 --> 00:49:24.168
My name is Carmen Logan.

945
00:49:24.295 --> 00:49:26.465
I’m with the Los Angeles
Police Department.

946
00:49:26.547 --> 00:49:28.547
-You’re a police officer?
-[Carmen] Yes. ma’am.

947
00:49:28.674 --> 00:49:29.934
May I come in?

948
00:49:30.009 --> 00:49:31.339
Um. I’d like to see

949
00:49:31.469 --> 00:49:34.009
some identification first.
please.

950
00:49:36.015 --> 00:49:37.225
What is this about?

951
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:39.269
I got a call
from Pacific Mutual.

952
00:49:39.351 --> 00:49:40.771
From who?

953
00:49:40.853 --> 00:49:43.193
If you’ll just give me
a few minutes.

954
00:49:51.697 --> 00:49:53.617
Please. have a sit.

955
00:49:55.534 --> 00:49:57.414
Can I get you anything to drink?

956
00:49:57.536 --> 00:50:00.456
-No. I’m fine.
-Okay.

957
00:50:01.916 --> 00:50:06.286
So you said Pacific Mutual?
The bank?

958
00:50:06.378 --> 00:50:08.048
-Yes.
-I’m not a client.

959
00:50:08.172 --> 00:50:09.922
No. but your credit card
company is.

960
00:50:10.049 --> 00:50:13.139
I’m part of the LAPD division
that investigates fraud.

961
00:50:13.219 --> 00:50:14.639
Fraud?

962
00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:17.010
Ms. Burns. you took out
a new card recently.

963
00:50:17.097 --> 00:50:18.807
Have you checked
the card’s balance?

964
00:50:18.891 --> 00:50:20.641
I haven’t gotten
a statement yet.

965
00:50:20.726 --> 00:50:22.886
You don’t monitor it online?

966
00:50:24.438 --> 00:50:25.938
-No.
-Okay.

967
00:50:26.065 --> 00:50:28.825
Well. would you mind
signing into the account

968
00:50:28.901 --> 00:50:30.861
just so we can take a look?

969
00:50:31.737 --> 00:50:33.067
Okay.

970
00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:43.000
[suspenseful music]

971
00:50:54.927 --> 00:50:56.547
[Carmen] Everything look okay?

972
00:50:57.263 --> 00:50:59.353
-I guess.
-Really?

973
00:50:59.431 --> 00:51:01.271
Looks like pretty unusual
spending for someone

974
00:51:01.392 --> 00:51:04.642
who rarely exceeds a $400
balance on her other card.

975
00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:08.570
Well. um.
some things came up this month.

976
00:51:08.649 --> 00:51:10.899
-A friend’s birthday.
-Hmm.

977
00:51:10.985 --> 00:51:13.655
Is someone else using
your card. Ms. Burns?

978
00:51:13.779 --> 00:51:15.859
No. Why?

979
00:51:16.907 --> 00:51:18.367
One of the vendors noticed
that the person

980
00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:20.370
trying to use your card
was a man.

981
00:51:20.452 --> 00:51:22.252
He said he was your fiance.

982
00:51:22.329 --> 00:51:24.789
I checked
the store’s security camera.

983
00:51:25.666 --> 00:51:27.706
Do you know this man?

984
00:51:27.793 --> 00:51:29.753
Is he your fiance?

985
00:51:31.463 --> 00:51:33.383
You didn’t know about this.
did you?

986
00:51:33.465 --> 00:51:36.795
Well. I knew he had the card.

987
00:51:36.885 --> 00:51:38.465
I ordered it for him.

988
00:51:38.554 --> 00:51:41.064
And he’s going to pay me back
right away with cash.

989
00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:43.390
So I don’t really see
why this is a problem.

990
00:51:43.475 --> 00:51:44.805
By making all these charges.

991
00:51:44.893 --> 00:51:46.733
he exceeded
your credit limit big time.

992
00:51:46.812 --> 00:51:50.022
You know that increases
your interest rate. don’t you?

993
00:51:50.983 --> 00:51:54.403
Okay. But I’m pretty sure
that’s not a crime.

994
00:51:55.321 --> 00:51:57.821
-What’s your boyfriend’s name?
-Walker Stevenson.

995
00:51:57.906 --> 00:51:59.526
That may be the name
he’s going by now.

996
00:51:59.658 --> 00:52:01.538
but his real name
is Steven Khamel.

997
00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:03.330
He’s been doing this
for a while.

998
00:52:03.412 --> 00:52:05.332
We just had trouble
getting ahead of him.

999
00:52:05.414 --> 00:52:07.334
Doing what exactly?

1000
00:52:07.416 --> 00:52:09.456
Conning women
out of their life savings.

1001
00:52:09.543 --> 00:52:13.173
racking up debt.
and then disappearing.

1002
00:52:16.508 --> 00:52:17.968
I don’t believe it.

1003
00:52:18.052 --> 00:52:21.972
You’re telling me
you’ve had no doubts about him?

1004
00:52:22.056 --> 00:52:24.766
This is just an ordinary
relationship?

1005
00:52:26.352 --> 00:52:30.232
Well. no. but I did my research.

1006
00:52:30.356 --> 00:52:31.766
checked him out.

1007
00:52:31.857 --> 00:52:33.357
Plus. he gave me...

1008
00:52:33.484 --> 00:52:36.074
he gave me 10 grand in cash
and. more importantly.

1009
00:52:36.195 --> 00:52:38.165
left an expensive painting
with me.

1010
00:52:39.531 --> 00:52:41.241
Okay. Can I see it?

1011
00:52:41.367 --> 00:52:42.907
Sure.

1012
00:52:43.035 --> 00:52:47.965
It’s a multimillion-dollar
Dutch painting.

1013
00:52:50.417 --> 00:52:51.877
He’s leaving it here
until it’s safe

1014
00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:53.300
to give it to the owner.

1015
00:52:53.379 --> 00:52:55.419
-May I?
-Yeah.

1016
00:52:55.547 --> 00:52:57.337
Just please be careful.

1017
00:53:10.229 --> 00:53:11.229
What are you doing?

1018
00:53:11.313 --> 00:53:12.903
This is one of a kind!

1019
00:53:12.981 --> 00:53:14.521
The sun. it can mess it.

1020
00:53:14.608 --> 00:53:16.398
[Carmen] No. no. no. no.

1021
00:53:16.485 --> 00:53:18.825
It’s a poster.
He. no doubt. bought it

1022
00:53:18.904 --> 00:53:21.204
for 40 bucks
at a museum gift shop.

1023
00:53:21.281 --> 00:53:25.491
The frame. he probably
picked up at a yard sale.

1024
00:53:34.086 --> 00:53:36.046
[sighs]

1025
00:53:38.590 --> 00:53:39.760
What do I do?

1026
00:53:39.883 --> 00:53:42.263
When did he say he’d return?

1027
00:53:43.178 --> 00:53:45.928
He didn’t know.
A few days. Maybe a week.

1028
00:53:46.014 --> 00:53:49.564
Okay. I need you to pretend
like everything is fine.

1029
00:53:49.643 --> 00:53:51.273
He can’t know
that you’re on to him.

1030
00:53:51.395 --> 00:53:53.905
And then as soon as you hear
from him. let me know.

1031
00:53:53.981 --> 00:53:59.401
[sighs]
And if I don’t let you know?

1032
00:54:00.487 --> 00:54:02.067
You think that’s a good idea?

1033
00:54:02.156 --> 00:54:04.156
It’s possible he’ll pay me back.

1034
00:54:04.283 --> 00:54:08.253
I mean.
maybe he just needs help.

1035
00:54:08.328 --> 00:54:10.658
There’s gotta be reason he lied.

1036
00:54:11.832 --> 00:54:14.252
I’m afraid to ask how much cash
you’ve already given him

1037
00:54:14.334 --> 00:54:17.594
because some of that will go
towards conning another woman.

1038
00:54:17.671 --> 00:54:20.131
That’s how he works.

1039
00:54:22.217 --> 00:54:23.887
If you help me.

1040
00:54:23.969 --> 00:54:25.469
we can stop Mr. Khamel

1041
00:54:25.596 --> 00:54:27.636
from fleecing another woman.

1042
00:54:29.850 --> 00:54:31.810
How many are there?

1043
00:54:31.894 --> 00:54:33.694
That we know of?

1044
00:54:33.812 --> 00:54:35.902
Do you really wanna know?

1045
00:54:42.362 --> 00:54:45.742
[cellphone ringing]

1046
00:54:55.334 --> 00:54:56.544
Hey.

1047
00:54:56.668 --> 00:54:58.628
Kate. I was--
I was so worried about you.

1048
00:54:58.712 --> 00:55:00.302
I’ve been calling.
I’ve been texting.

1049
00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:01.340
but you didn’t answer.

1050
00:55:01.423 --> 00:55:03.093
I’m sorry.

1051
00:55:03.175 --> 00:55:05.895
I. um. I wasn’t feeling well.

1052
00:55:06.011 --> 00:55:07.641
I just woke up from a nap.

1053
00:55:07.721 --> 00:55:10.471
I’m sorry.
I hope I didn’t wake you.

1054
00:55:10.557 --> 00:55:13.887
No. I just got out
of the shower. so...

1055
00:55:14.019 --> 00:55:17.979
Yeah? I wish I was there
to peel the towel off of you.

1056
00:55:18.065 --> 00:55:20.035
make you feel better.

1057
00:55:21.693 --> 00:55:24.113
Walker. um. I got an email

1058
00:55:24.196 --> 00:55:26.276
from my credit card company
today.

1059
00:55:26.365 --> 00:55:27.535
Uh-huh.

1060
00:55:27.658 --> 00:55:30.118
You exceeded my credit limit

1061
00:55:30.202 --> 00:55:32.202
and now my interest rate
is going up.

1062
00:55:32.287 --> 00:55:35.327
Wait. Is this why
you’ve been ignoring me?

1063
00:55:35.415 --> 00:55:37.035
Kate. you don’t need to worry.

1064
00:55:37.125 --> 00:55:39.955
I said I’d pay you back long
before your charges are due.

1065
00:55:40.045 --> 00:55:44.165
Yeah. I guess it’s just.
um. all the credit.

1066
00:55:44.258 --> 00:55:46.628
that has me a little nervous.

1067
00:55:46.718 --> 00:55:49.388
Is there any way
you could pay me back this week?

1068
00:55:49.471 --> 00:55:50.811
Well. of course.

1069
00:55:50.889 --> 00:55:52.639
I totally understand.

1070
00:55:52.724 --> 00:55:54.064
And I’ll be back very soon.

1071
00:55:54.184 --> 00:55:56.734
But until then.

1072
00:55:56.812 --> 00:55:59.482
can you just trust me a longer?

1073
00:56:00.691 --> 00:56:01.981
Okay.

1074
00:56:02.067 --> 00:56:03.687
[Walker] I’ll see you very soon.

1075
00:56:03.777 --> 00:56:07.817
And. Kate. I love you.

1076
00:56:09.408 --> 00:56:11.408
Goodnight. Walker.

1077
00:56:12.911 --> 00:56:16.251
[suspenseful music]

1078
00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:25.719
[car engine revs]

1079
00:56:42.566 --> 00:56:44.146
[Don] That’s why we had you
come in this morning. Ms. Burns.

1080
00:56:44.276 --> 00:56:46.356
So you’re saying someone
tried to move all my money

1081
00:56:46.445 --> 00:56:49.325
-out of my savings account?
-Yes.

1082
00:56:49.448 --> 00:56:52.198
As happens in these cases.
data is breached

1083
00:56:52.284 --> 00:56:54.874
and the criminal signs
into the person’s account

1084
00:56:54.953 --> 00:56:56.963
and then attempts
to transfer a large sum.

1085
00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:59.210
So someone hacked
into your database

1086
00:56:59.291 --> 00:57:01.211
and got my username
and password?

1087
00:57:01.293 --> 00:57:03.213
Well. no.

1088
00:57:04.046 --> 00:57:04.916
Not in this case.

1089
00:57:05.005 --> 00:57:06.975
Okay. What happened?

1090
00:57:07.049 --> 00:57:08.629
[Don] Well. thankfully.
you set up a two-factor

1091
00:57:08.759 --> 00:57:11.139
authentication
to approve large transfers.

1092
00:57:11.261 --> 00:57:13.761
We sent a text to your phone
but you never responded.

1093
00:57:13.847 --> 00:57:15.887
so the transfer
couldn’t be completed.

1094
00:57:15.974 --> 00:57:18.734
Yeah. I’ve been a little busy

1095
00:57:18.810 --> 00:57:22.400
and I actually
never fully read it.

1096
00:57:22.481 --> 00:57:24.021
I thought it was spam.

1097
00:57:24.149 --> 00:57:25.819
When the transfer attempt
happened again.

1098
00:57:25.901 --> 00:57:27.821
our system knew
you had been hacked.

1099
00:57:27.903 --> 00:57:29.493
That’s why I called.

1100
00:57:29.613 --> 00:57:30.743
Well. thank you.

1101
00:57:30.822 --> 00:57:32.162
I’m glad you did.

1102
00:57:33.325 --> 00:57:35.495
We usually don’t ask people
to come into the bank

1103
00:57:35.577 --> 00:57:36.697
when they’ve been hacked.

1104
00:57:36.828 --> 00:57:38.408
Okay.

1105
00:57:38.497 --> 00:57:39.907
Whoever got into your account

1106
00:57:39.998 --> 00:57:42.418
must have had quite a bit
of information on you.

1107
00:57:42.501 --> 00:57:45.001
Unfortunately.
a lot of people’s information

1108
00:57:45.087 --> 00:57:46.417
is fairly easy to get.

1109
00:57:46.505 --> 00:57:49.555
Name. address. Social.
driver’s license.

1110
00:57:49.675 --> 00:57:52.395
But the security questions
are a lot harder.

1111
00:57:52.511 --> 00:57:54.431
-What?
-So your account

1112
00:57:54.513 --> 00:57:57.023
is guarded by a series
of personal questions.

1113
00:57:57.099 --> 00:57:59.849
Prompts that you set up when
you first opened the account.

1114
00:57:59.935 --> 00:58:03.695
You know.
mother’s maiden name. first pet.

1115
00:58:03.772 --> 00:58:05.572
those kinds of things.

1116
00:58:05.691 --> 00:58:09.031
This person
got all those questions right.

1117
00:58:09.111 --> 00:58:10.361
What would your name be

1118
00:58:10.445 --> 00:58:11.945
if you got
your mother’s maiden name?

1119
00:58:12.030 --> 00:58:13.030
Johnson.

1120
00:58:13.115 --> 00:58:15.875
Ours was a Great Dane. Geronimo.

1121
00:58:15.951 --> 00:58:17.741
Geronimo. I like that.

1122
00:58:17.869 --> 00:58:19.829
[Don] Ms. Burns?

1123
00:58:21.373 --> 00:58:22.873
Ms. Burns?

1124
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:23.960
Are you okay?

1125
00:58:24.042 --> 00:58:26.132
Um. yeah.

1126
00:58:26.211 --> 00:58:27.711
Yeah.

1127
00:58:27.838 --> 00:58:30.258
Well. we’ll conduct
our own investigation.

1128
00:58:30.382 --> 00:58:32.842
but whoever did this
obviously knows you

1129
00:58:32.926 --> 00:58:34.546
and knows you well.

1130
00:58:35.554 --> 00:58:37.314
I would suggest
contacting the police.

1131
00:58:37.389 --> 00:58:39.309
see if they’ll investigate.

1132
00:58:40.392 --> 00:58:43.732
[Kate]
I feel so incredibly stupid.

1133
00:58:43.812 --> 00:58:47.482
A lot of women.
smart professional women

1134
00:58:47.566 --> 00:58:49.476
have fallen for his scheme.

1135
00:58:49.568 --> 00:58:50.988
You’re not alone.

1136
00:58:51.069 --> 00:58:52.319
Still...

1137
00:58:52.404 --> 00:58:54.744
This wasn’t a Nigerian scam.
Ms. Burns.

1138
00:58:54.865 --> 00:58:57.625
Steven Khamel
is incredibly sophisticated.

1139
00:58:57.743 --> 00:58:59.993
What do I do now?

1140
00:59:00.078 --> 00:59:01.868
How do I get my money back?

1141
00:59:01.955 --> 00:59:04.325
Well. once he’s caught.
you can file a civil suit

1142
00:59:04.416 --> 00:59:05.826
to get back your cash.

1143
00:59:05.917 --> 00:59:07.497
But the credit card.

1144
00:59:07.586 --> 00:59:10.166
because you gave him
the card to use.

1145
00:59:10.255 --> 00:59:12.875
those charges
are probably a loss.

1146
00:59:14.134 --> 00:59:16.894
[sighs] Okay.

1147
00:59:16.970 --> 00:59:20.140
I want my money back. of course.

1148
00:59:20.265 --> 00:59:22.765
but. more importantly.
I want him caught.

1149
00:59:22.851 --> 00:59:25.941
-You’re sure?
-Of course. I’m sure.

1150
00:59:26.646 --> 00:59:28.266
Many of Mr. Khamel’s victims

1151
00:59:28.356 --> 00:59:30.276
didn’t wanna help us
track him down.

1152
00:59:30.358 --> 00:59:31.778
Why?

1153
00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:33.280
Well. I can’t be sure.

1154
00:59:33.361 --> 00:59:35.321
but maybe they felt
the same way you do.

1155
00:59:35.447 --> 00:59:38.027
embarrassed that
they got taken advantage of.

1156
00:59:38.116 --> 00:59:40.196
But. also. I believe

1157
00:59:40.285 --> 00:59:43.365
his ability to charm
or intimidate

1158
00:59:43.455 --> 00:59:45.545
shouldn’t be underestimated.

1159
00:59:46.666 --> 00:59:51.626
Look. right now.
I am well past embarrassment.

1160
00:59:51.713 --> 00:59:52.963
I’m angry.

1161
00:59:53.048 --> 00:59:55.878
And I am not going
to let him scare me.

1162
00:59:55.967 --> 00:59:59.257
-Just tell me what I need to do.
-Okay.

1163
00:59:59.346 --> 01:00:01.136
Maybe when he calls.

1164
01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:02.934
I’ll tell him
that I wanna make him dinner

1165
01:00:03.016 --> 01:00:05.726
and then you come in
and arrest him.

1166
01:00:05.811 --> 01:00:08.861
Well. he has highly attuned
skills at reading people.

1167
01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:10.770
And because he couldn’t transfer
your money.

1168
01:00:10.857 --> 01:00:12.397
he knows the bank is on alert.

1169
01:00:12.484 --> 01:00:14.994
He probably already suspects
something’s up.

1170
01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:17.610
That’s what’s made him
so hard to catch.

1171
01:00:17.697 --> 01:00:20.827
But there’s gotta be
some way to get him though.

1172
01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:23.201
Oh. men like him
have a lot of pride.

1173
01:00:23.328 --> 01:00:26.658
He might lose his cool
or mess up

1174
01:00:26.748 --> 01:00:29.248
if you were to chip away at it.

1175
01:00:33.255 --> 01:00:35.845
Um. I need to check
your audio so I can...

1176
01:00:35.924 --> 01:00:37.554
could you say something. please?

1177
01:00:37.676 --> 01:00:39.586
Same something.

1178
01:00:39.678 --> 01:00:41.928
Okay. Sounds good.

1179
01:00:43.348 --> 01:00:44.518
[sighs]

1180
01:00:44.599 --> 01:00:46.059
You ever done a podcast before?

1181
01:00:46.184 --> 01:00:47.774
[chuckles] No.

1182
01:00:47.853 --> 01:00:49.693
Um. I mean.
I’ve been interviewed

1183
01:00:49.771 --> 01:00:53.481
for articles but never
in front of the camera.

1184
01:00:53.567 --> 01:00:55.567
Just act like you’re having
coffee with a friend.

1185
01:00:55.694 --> 01:00:58.864
very relaxed and natural.

1186
01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:01.279
I’ll ask questions and all you
have to do is respond.

1187
01:01:01.366 --> 01:01:03.826
I’m still shocked you responded
to my email.

1188
01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:06.040
and so quickly.
Thank you.

1189
01:01:06.163 --> 01:01:08.333
My team and I are suckers
for a good story.

1190
01:01:08.415 --> 01:01:11.885
[chuckles] Well. I blasted
all over my social media.

1191
01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:13.420
so everyone I know
should be watching.

1192
01:01:13.545 --> 01:01:15.765
Okay. Are you guys ready
to start recording?

1193
01:01:15.881 --> 01:01:17.471
-Uh...
-Yeah.

1194
01:01:17.549 --> 01:01:19.179
You can put this on.

1195
01:01:19.259 --> 01:01:20.889
Thank you.

1196
01:01:20.969 --> 01:01:23.009
Hey. just relax. okay?

1197
01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:27.096
Just be yourself
and share what he’s done to you.

1198
01:01:28.018 --> 01:01:30.058
Now. let’s nail
that son of a bitch.

1199
01:01:31.396 --> 01:01:35.226
[Lucy]
Recording in three. two...

1200
01:01:36.443 --> 01:01:38.613
Hello. everyone.

1201
01:01:38.737 --> 01:01:43.317
Welcome to episode 312
of You Wouldn’t Believe.

1202
01:01:43.408 --> 01:01:47.408
a podcast about the crazy things
that happen around us.

1203
01:01:47.495 --> 01:01:49.325
I’m your host. Sarah Masters.

1204
01:01:49.414 --> 01:01:51.374
And today’s story is a story

1205
01:01:51.458 --> 01:01:54.128
that is every woman’s nightmare.

1206
01:01:54.252 --> 01:01:55.552
You go on a dating app.

1207
01:01:55.629 --> 01:01:57.299
You meet a cute guy.

1208
01:01:57.422 --> 01:01:59.422
He seems like Mr. Right

1209
01:01:59.507 --> 01:02:01.507
but he ends up being Mr. Wrong.

1210
01:02:01.593 --> 01:02:03.343
Kate Burns is with me today

1211
01:02:03.428 --> 01:02:05.348
to talk about
a hellish experience

1212
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:07.010
that she’s just been through.

1213
01:02:07.098 --> 01:02:09.768
-Welcome. Kate.
-Thank you for having me. Sarah.

1214
01:02:09.851 --> 01:02:12.561
So you met a guy
on a dating app.

1215
01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:15.266
-Then what happened?
-Uh. yeah.

1216
01:02:15.357 --> 01:02:18.107
I met a handsome. charming man

1217
01:02:18.235 --> 01:02:20.825
who took me
to fancy restaurants.

1218
01:02:20.946 --> 01:02:23.276
sent me flowers.

1219
01:02:23.365 --> 01:02:26.705
But it turns out
he was doing all of that

1220
01:02:26.785 --> 01:02:28.755
to scam me out of my savings.

1221
01:02:28.828 --> 01:02:31.408
Well. candlelight and roses

1222
01:02:31.498 --> 01:02:33.288
are every woman’s Achilles heel.

1223
01:02:33.375 --> 01:02:36.595
Yeah. I mean. that’s the worst
part of all of it.

1224
01:02:37.379 --> 01:02:39.799
This guy.
he’s fooled many other women.

1225
01:02:39.881 --> 01:02:41.971
But. of course.
you didn’t know that.

1226
01:02:42.092 --> 01:02:44.342
No. Not until recently.

1227
01:02:44.469 --> 01:02:46.429
[Sarah]
So tell us about what happened.

1228
01:02:46.513 --> 01:02:49.393
Uh. well. he told me

1229
01:02:49.474 --> 01:02:51.644
that his name
was Walker Stevenson.

1230
01:02:51.726 --> 01:02:55.146
Since then. I’ve learned that
he’s actually Steven Khamel.

1231
01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:57.940
He claims to be
a wealthy art dealer.

1232
01:02:58.024 --> 01:03:01.404
And he plays the part
by wearing designer clothes.

1233
01:03:01.486 --> 01:03:03.146
going to fancy restaurants.

1234
01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.490
traveling all over Europe.

1235
01:03:07.075 --> 01:03:08.245
What?

1236
01:03:09.327 --> 01:03:13.117
Actually. I don’t know
if he travels at all.

1237
01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:17.341
But I do know
that he is not a millionaire.

1238
01:03:18.169 --> 01:03:22.169
He’s nothing more than
a con man who preys on women.

1239
01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:27.473
He made it seem like he was
being pursued by criminals

1240
01:03:27.554 --> 01:03:29.184
who wanted this art

1241
01:03:29.306 --> 01:03:31.766
that he had bought
for one of his client.

1242
01:03:31.850 --> 01:03:34.350
And he told me that
to throw them off his trail.

1243
01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:37.187
he needed to use my credit card
and borrow my money.

1244
01:03:37.314 --> 01:03:39.194
Wow.

1245
01:03:39.274 --> 01:03:40.784
That’s rough.

1246
01:03:40.859 --> 01:03:42.569
I mean. most of us
feel embarrassed

1247
01:03:42.694 --> 01:03:44.034
when we feel like
we’ve been had.

1248
01:03:44.112 --> 01:03:46.492
It is so brave of you

1249
01:03:46.573 --> 01:03:48.993
-to come forward and share this.
-Yeah.

1250
01:03:49.075 --> 01:03:53.695
It’s been hard to admit
to myself and others.

1251
01:03:53.788 --> 01:03:57.378
But I don’t wanna allow him
to do this to any other women.

1252
01:03:57.459 --> 01:04:02.459
If you see this man.
call the police immediately.

1253
01:04:02.547 --> 01:04:05.047
Steven Khamel must be stopped.

1254
01:04:05.133 --> 01:04:08.393
[dramatic music]

1255
01:04:13.975 --> 01:04:15.305
I can’t wait any longer.

1256
01:04:15.393 --> 01:04:17.063
For what? Dessert?

1257
01:04:17.145 --> 01:04:19.815
No. The. um...
the episode has dropped

1258
01:04:19.898 --> 01:04:22.688
and I want to see if anybody
saw it and reached out.

1259
01:04:22.776 --> 01:04:25.566
Yeah. a lot of text messages
from friends. family.

1260
01:04:25.653 --> 01:04:28.243
My mom called. of course.

1261
01:04:30.075 --> 01:04:31.585
So did Walker.

1262
01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:34.201
So he saw it.

1263
01:04:35.163 --> 01:04:36.793
He left eight messages.

1264
01:04:36.915 --> 01:04:38.255
Well. play them.

1265
01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:40.845
I wanna hear
what he has to say for himself.

1266
01:04:42.003 --> 01:04:44.263
I don’t--I don’t know if I can.

1267
01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:46.840
Remember.
you did the right thing.

1268
01:04:46.925 --> 01:04:49.475
You know. sticks and stones
may break your bones

1269
01:04:49.594 --> 01:04:51.684
-but words will never--
-I know.

1270
01:04:52.263 --> 01:04:54.223
-You’re right.
-Yeah.

1271
01:04:54.307 --> 01:04:55.467
[sighs]

1272
01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:56.730
Okay.

1273
01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:58.480
[Walker] Hi. Kate. It’s me.

1274
01:04:58.603 --> 01:05:00.733
I. uh...I just got back
into town

1275
01:05:00.814 --> 01:05:02.324
and heard something
very disturbing.

1276
01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:05.740
Please. um...
please call me right away.

1277
01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:09.494
Kate. it’s me again.

1278
01:05:09.614 --> 01:05:12.034
What is this crap? Huh?

1279
01:05:12.117 --> 01:05:14.737
How could you do this to me
after everything we’ve shared?

1280
01:05:14.828 --> 01:05:16.748
There’s so much
you don’t understand.

1281
01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:18.290
So much that I wanna tell you.

1282
01:05:18.373 --> 01:05:21.633
Kate. listen to me. I love you.

1283
01:05:21.709 --> 01:05:23.789
He’s insane.

1284
01:05:27.632 --> 01:05:29.222
[Walker] Okay. you little bitch.

1285
01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:31.970
If this is how you wanna
play it. you have no idea

1286
01:05:32.095 --> 01:05:33.805
who you’re messing with here.
all right?

1287
01:05:33.888 --> 01:05:36.138
You have no idea
what I can do to you.

1288
01:05:36.224 --> 01:05:37.434
You ruined my life.

1289
01:05:37.517 --> 01:05:39.477
and I’m making you
a promise today.

1290
01:05:39.561 --> 01:05:41.401
I am gonna ruin yours.

1291
01:05:41.479 --> 01:05:42.609
Enough.

1292
01:05:42.689 --> 01:05:44.479
There’s nothing else
you need to hear.

1293
01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:48.145
Maybe I should stay over
the night.

1294
01:05:49.279 --> 01:05:51.279
Yeah. Thanks.

1295
01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:56.994
You doing okay?

1296
01:05:57.912 --> 01:05:59.332
Yeah.

1297
01:06:00.582 --> 01:06:03.382
I’m fine. Just tired.

1298
01:06:03.501 --> 01:06:06.001
You know. I think
I’m gonna hit the sack.

1299
01:06:06.087 --> 01:06:08.837
Well. free to wake me up
if you need to.

1300
01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:10.165
For any reason.

1301
01:06:10.258 --> 01:06:12.088
Thanks. Viv.

1302
01:06:12.177 --> 01:06:13.677
Goodnight.

1303
01:06:19.726 --> 01:06:23.096
[suspenseful music]

1304
01:06:55.553 --> 01:06:57.393
[sighs]

1305
01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:12.740
[doorbell ringing]

1306
01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:15.070
All right. I’m coming.

1307
01:07:22.539 --> 01:07:24.419
[knocks on door]

1308
01:07:34.842 --> 01:07:35.892
Hey!

1309
01:07:35.969 --> 01:07:37.929
I saw the podcast.

1310
01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:39.264
He...

1311
01:07:40.431 --> 01:07:42.601
he did the same thing to me.

1312
01:07:45.311 --> 01:07:46.731
Thank you.

1313
01:07:50.275 --> 01:07:53.785
So when did you find out
about the real Walker?

1314
01:07:53.903 --> 01:07:56.203
I opened up a credit card
for him.

1315
01:07:56.281 --> 01:07:58.451
just like you did.

1316
01:07:58.575 --> 01:08:01.205
And he maxed out the card

1317
01:08:01.286 --> 01:08:04.246
and then he paid me back
with a check

1318
01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:05.960
and the check bounced.

1319
01:08:06.833 --> 01:08:10.543
I’m embarrassed to say that...

1320
01:08:10.628 --> 01:08:12.458
What?

1321
01:08:12.547 --> 01:08:14.917
Even after the check bounced.

1322
01:08:15.008 --> 01:08:16.878
I still believed him.

1323
01:08:16.968 --> 01:08:20.548
He gave me so many excuses.

1324
01:08:21.556 --> 01:08:24.056
I...I don’t know.

1325
01:08:24.142 --> 01:08:26.732
I guess I just...

1326
01:08:26.811 --> 01:08:27.981
I wanted to believe.

1327
01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:30.314
I understand.

1328
01:08:30.398 --> 01:08:32.568
Look. Eliza.
you should have told me

1329
01:08:32.650 --> 01:08:34.320
when I asked you about him.

1330
01:08:34.444 --> 01:08:35.864
I know.

1331
01:08:35.987 --> 01:08:39.407
I know. I...
I just...I couldn’t.

1332
01:08:39.490 --> 01:08:41.160
But you have to share
your story.

1333
01:08:41.284 --> 01:08:43.584
I mean. not just with me
but with the public

1334
01:08:43.661 --> 01:08:45.911
so that more women
don’t get hurt.

1335
01:08:45.997 --> 01:08:47.787
Oh. no. no.

1336
01:08:47.874 --> 01:08:49.964
That’s why I came here.

1337
01:08:50.043 --> 01:08:51.423
I came here to warn you.

1338
01:08:51.502 --> 01:08:54.552
to let you know that
you can’t do that anymore.

1339
01:08:54.672 --> 01:08:57.722
You just don’t understand.

1340
01:08:57.842 --> 01:08:59.592
Understand what?

1341
01:08:59.677 --> 01:09:02.347
What the criminals
might do to you.

1342
01:09:02.472 --> 01:09:03.852
What criminals?

1343
01:09:03.931 --> 01:09:06.681
Much of what Walker says
is a lie

1344
01:09:06.768 --> 01:09:09.268
but he does deal
with some dangerous people.

1345
01:09:09.354 --> 01:09:10.944
I know that for certain.

1346
01:09:11.022 --> 01:09:14.862
And if you keep talking
about him in public.

1347
01:09:16.235 --> 01:09:18.645
they might hurt you
to get to him.

1348
01:09:18.738 --> 01:09:20.988
But why would anyone wanna
hurt me to get to him?

1349
01:09:21.074 --> 01:09:22.914
I just outed him
publicly as a liar.

1350
01:09:23.034 --> 01:09:26.004
I’ve seen these people
do terrible things

1351
01:09:26.079 --> 01:09:27.659
when they don’t get
what they want.

1352
01:09:27.747 --> 01:09:31.167
And I felt guilty
that I didn’t warn you before.

1353
01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:33.340
so I was hoping that I could now

1354
01:09:33.419 --> 01:09:35.169
before it’s too late.

1355
01:09:35.254 --> 01:09:39.304
Look. Eliza. I appreciate you
coming to warn me

1356
01:09:39.384 --> 01:09:41.644
but I am not afraid.

1357
01:09:41.719 --> 01:09:43.719
Now. that the story is out.
I’m pretty sure

1358
01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:45.256
no one will mess with me.

1359
01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:47.060
That’s where you’re wrong.

1360
01:09:47.141 --> 01:09:50.061
These guys are vindictive.

1361
01:09:50.186 --> 01:09:53.396
And if somebody
gets in their way.

1362
01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:54.613
they know how to hurt you

1363
01:09:54.732 --> 01:09:57.072
in ways that
you wouldn’t expect.

1364
01:09:59.237 --> 01:10:02.067
Eliza.
how did you get my address?

1365
01:10:02.156 --> 01:10:04.486
Uh. you can find
anybody’s address

1366
01:10:04.575 --> 01:10:06.235
with an internet search.

1367
01:10:06.327 --> 01:10:08.367
No. Uh. not mine.

1368
01:10:08.454 --> 01:10:10.004
As a relator.
I have to be extra safe.

1369
01:10:10.081 --> 01:10:12.831
The deed for this house
isn’t under my name.

1370
01:10:12.917 --> 01:10:14.587
It’s under an LLC.

1371
01:10:14.711 --> 01:10:16.591
It’s not listed anywhere.

1372
01:10:16.713 --> 01:10:20.593
I swear I found you
on an internet search.

1373
01:10:20.717 --> 01:10:23.507
Okay. Here. I’ll show you.

1374
01:10:28.766 --> 01:10:29.886
[gasps]

1375
01:10:29.976 --> 01:10:31.976
You should have
just listened to me.

1376
01:10:32.103 --> 01:10:35.813
All he wants is
to be left alone.

1377
01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:37.110
Eliza. please.

1378
01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:38.323
You do not wanna do this.

1379
01:10:38.443 --> 01:10:40.243
especially not for him.

1380
01:10:40.319 --> 01:10:42.819
Oh. but he loves me.

1381
01:10:42.947 --> 01:10:44.947
No. he doesn’t.

1382
01:10:45.032 --> 01:10:46.282
He is using you.

1383
01:10:46.409 --> 01:10:48.289
He uses everybody!
You have to see that!

1384
01:10:48.369 --> 01:10:50.999
No. I’m special. okay?

1385
01:10:51.122 --> 01:10:52.462
He told me so.

1386
01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:54.962
Eliza. please think
about what you’re doing.

1387
01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:57.674
We can go to the police.
He won’t hurt you.

1388
01:10:57.795 --> 01:10:59.455
Hurt me?

1389
01:10:59.547 --> 01:11:02.377
He loves me.

1390
01:11:02.467 --> 01:11:03.627

1403
01:12:03.694 --> 01:12:04.954
[Vivian] What are you doing?

1404
01:12:05.029 --> 01:12:06.159
What are you doing?

1405
01:12:06.239 --> 01:12:07.869
I just came to check in on you.

1406
01:12:07.949 --> 01:12:10.619
I thought you might
still be sleeping.

1407
01:12:10.701 --> 01:12:12.411
Well. no.

1408
01:12:12.537 --> 01:12:13.867
I...

1409
01:12:14.956 --> 01:12:16.496
I had company.

1410
01:12:17.416 --> 01:12:20.626
[dramatic music]

1411
01:12:27.844 --> 01:12:31.144
So no more letting unknowns
into your house.

1412
01:12:31.222 --> 01:12:32.722
But I did know her.

1413
01:12:32.807 --> 01:12:35.057
Well. unknowns are those
with an unknown affiliation.

1414
01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:37.774
Something tells me he’s not
gonna let up right away.

1415
01:12:37.895 --> 01:12:41.065
He probably has a few more women
who would do his bidding.

1416
01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:43.190
You should come stay
at my place for a while.

1417
01:12:43.276 --> 01:12:46.896
That’s a nice offer
but I don’t wanna run away.

1418
01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:50.239
I don’t wanna let him win
in this intimidation game.

1419
01:12:50.324 --> 01:12:53.994
And if I disappear. your house
is the first place he’d look.

1420
01:12:54.078 --> 01:12:56.458
Look. I made sure all the doors
and windows are locked.

1421
01:12:56.581 --> 01:12:59.001
We’ll put a car out front
to watch the house at night

1422
01:12:59.083 --> 01:13:02.343
until we catch him
or the threat stop.

1423
01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:04.420
I hope they do soon.

1424
01:13:04.547 --> 01:13:06.217
I’ve got tonight’s shift.

1425
01:13:06.299 --> 01:13:08.089
It’s all gonna be okay.

1426
01:13:11.095 --> 01:13:14.345
[dramatic music]

1427
01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:44.382
Hey.

1428
01:13:44.462 --> 01:13:46.552
Just. uh. one sugar. no cream.

1429
01:13:46.631 --> 01:13:47.881
I hope that’s okay.

1430
01:13:47.965 --> 01:13:49.625
Just what I needed.

1431
01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:53.009
So. uh. you’re really gonna
stay out here all night?

1432
01:13:53.137 --> 01:13:55.007
-Yes. ma’am.
-Okay.

1433
01:13:55.139 --> 01:13:56.639
Well. you know. like I said.

1434
01:13:56.724 --> 01:13:58.644
you can come and sleep
on the couch if you want.

1435
01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:00.808
No. Cops don’t sleep
in civilian’s houses

1436
01:14:00.937 --> 01:14:02.307
when they’re on the clock.

1437
01:14:02.396 --> 01:14:04.306
Anyway. I need a view
of the entire house.

1438
01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:05.730
Okay.

1439
01:14:05.816 --> 01:14:07.686
And getting out of the office

1440
01:14:07.818 --> 01:14:09.358
is a good change of pace for me.

1441
01:14:09.487 --> 01:14:12.277
In the last few years.
I spent most of my days

1442
01:14:12.365 --> 01:14:15.785
poring over credit card receipts
and other financial documents.

1443
01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:18.248
If I didn’t get out
into the field once in a while.

1444
01:14:18.329 --> 01:14:19.289
then I’d get soft.

1445
01:14:19.372 --> 01:14:20.912
Yeah. Okay.

1446
01:14:20.998 --> 01:14:22.788
Well. um. if. uh...

1447
01:14:22.875 --> 01:14:25.245
if you need anything.
just ring the doorbell.

1448
01:14:25.336 --> 01:14:29.046
I probably won’t be sleeping
much tonight anyway.

1449
01:14:29.173 --> 01:14:30.473
You should try.

1450
01:14:30.549 --> 01:14:32.549
It’s the best thing
for you right now.

1451
01:14:32.677 --> 01:14:35.677
Nothing is gonna happen to you
while I’m sitting here.

1452
01:14:35.763 --> 01:14:37.393
Promise.

1453
01:14:37.515 --> 01:14:39.105
[sighs]

1454
01:14:40.393 --> 01:14:43.653
[dramatic music]

1455
01:14:46.941 --> 01:14:49.611
[insects chirping]

1456
01:14:52.113 --> 01:14:53.663
[sighs]

1457
01:14:55.866 --> 01:14:58.036
[owl hoots]

1458
01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:03.119
[tense music]

1459
01:15:42.246 --> 01:15:44.036
[thuds]

1460
01:15:44.123 --> 01:15:47.503
[suspenseful music]

1461
01:16:09.982 --> 01:16:11.532
Good morning.

1462
01:16:15.279 --> 01:16:16.819
Huh. [grunts]

1463
01:16:16.947 --> 01:16:19.197
[shatters]

1464
01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:24.913
[clock ticking]

1465
01:16:35.966 --> 01:16:38.586
[footsteps]

1466
01:16:45.851 --> 01:16:47.441
How are you feeling?

1467
01:16:48.687 --> 01:16:49.727
Where am I?

1468
01:16:49.814 --> 01:16:52.194
Somewhere no one can find you.

1469
01:16:52.316 --> 01:16:54.396
That’s why you don’t have a gag.

1470
01:16:56.112 --> 01:16:58.032
Drink.

1471
01:16:58.155 --> 01:16:59.445
You must be thirsty.

1472
01:16:59.532 --> 01:17:02.622
And it will flush the chloroform
out of your system.

1473
01:17:04.328 --> 01:17:06.368
Come now. Kate.
Don’t be so stubborn.

1474
01:17:06.497 --> 01:17:08.207
You’re proving nothing
by refusing.

1475
01:17:08.332 --> 01:17:09.712
You could have poisoned it.

1476
01:17:09.834 --> 01:17:11.594
If I wanted to kill you.

1477
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:13.209
you’d be dead already.

1478
01:17:15.089 --> 01:17:16.969
That’s my girl.

1479
01:17:20.219 --> 01:17:22.009
Hmm?

1480
01:17:22.096 --> 01:17:23.676
[spit]

1481
01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:28.310
Now. that wasn’t very nice.

1482
01:17:29.603 --> 01:17:32.193
After everything you’ve done.
you want nice?

1483
01:17:32.314 --> 01:17:33.944
[Walker chuckles]

1484
01:17:34.024 --> 01:17:35.984
I always liked your spunk. Kate.

1485
01:17:36.068 --> 01:17:37.358
I really did.

1486
01:17:37.486 --> 01:17:39.446
Probably your most
admirable characteristic.

1487
01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:41.320
That and that you were smarter

1488
01:17:41.407 --> 01:17:43.237
than all the other girls.

1489
01:17:43.367 --> 01:17:45.947
But I guess I paid for that.
didn’t I?

1490
01:17:47.163 --> 01:17:48.873
What do you want. Walker?

1491
01:17:48.998 --> 01:17:50.958
What do I want?

1492
01:17:52.001 --> 01:17:53.791
What do I want?

1493
01:17:55.045 --> 01:17:57.045
You ruin my life. Kate.

1494
01:17:57.173 --> 01:17:59.633
Now. I can’t go back
to what I was doing.

1495
01:17:59.717 --> 01:18:02.217
Because of you.
my picture went viral.

1496
01:18:02.303 --> 01:18:04.643
Do you have any idea
how hard it would be

1497
01:18:04.722 --> 01:18:06.142
to convince new women?

1498
01:18:06.223 --> 01:18:08.933
Guess you’re gonna have
to start working. Walker.

1499
01:18:22.448 --> 01:18:25.698
I don’t have face
detection activated.

1500
01:18:25.784 --> 01:18:27.744
[Walker] Unlock it.

1501
01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:29.710
Why should I?

1502
01:18:31.248 --> 01:18:33.378
Because if you don’t...

1503
01:18:41.759 --> 01:18:45.099
[suspenseful music]

1504
01:18:49.683 --> 01:18:52.943
You know. it’s one thing
to commit financial crimes.

1505
01:18:53.979 --> 01:18:55.859
another to commit murder.

1506
01:18:56.857 --> 01:18:58.607
When they catch you.
you will go to jail

1507
01:18:58.734 --> 01:18:59.994
for the rest of your life.

1508
01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:01.990
Well. that’s the point. Kate.

1509
01:19:02.112 --> 01:19:04.362
You’re assuming I’ll be caught.

1510
01:19:09.787 --> 01:19:13.117
You’re right.
They probably won’t.

1511
01:19:14.625 --> 01:19:16.965
You’re always one step ahead.

1512
01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:22.840
I mean. you kidnapped me
with my phone

1513
01:19:22.967 --> 01:19:25.467
to get a wire transfer
approved. right?

1514
01:19:26.387 --> 01:19:28.257
Wish I had thought of that.

1515
01:19:37.648 --> 01:19:38.608
[sighs]

1516
01:19:38.691 --> 01:19:40.481
Let me make this simple.

1517
01:19:47.324 --> 01:19:49.874
Give me the password

1518
01:19:49.994 --> 01:19:51.874
and I won’t hurt you.

1519
01:19:54.832 --> 01:19:58.842
But you already have hurt me.

1520
01:19:58.961 --> 01:20:01.551
To be totally honest with you.
you broke my heart.

1521
01:20:01.672 --> 01:20:02.882
Why would I give you my savings.

1522
01:20:03.007 --> 01:20:04.467
so you can spend it
on another women?

1523
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:07.050
[chuckles]
No need to be so maudlin. Kate.

1524
01:20:07.177 --> 01:20:10.347
I’m sorry about the podcast.

1525
01:20:10.431 --> 01:20:13.021
I was hurt and angry
that I was just one

1526
01:20:13.142 --> 01:20:15.442
of your many girlfriends.

1527
01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:21.190
Don’t take it personally.
I mean. I. uh...

1528
01:20:22.359 --> 01:20:24.689
I enjoyed the time
we spent together.

1529
01:20:24.778 --> 01:20:26.198
Yeah.

1530
01:20:27.364 --> 01:20:30.204
I mean. we had some
spectacular nights. didn’t we?

1531
01:20:32.077 --> 01:20:35.747
And I would have gladly
given you all of my money.

1532
01:20:35.873 --> 01:20:38.173
helped you with your scam.

1533
01:20:38.250 --> 01:20:40.960
if you had just confided in me.

1534
01:20:41.045 --> 01:20:44.805
But instead you sent Eliza
to my house.

1535
01:20:44.882 --> 01:20:46.842
You can’t love her.

1536
01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:49.090
Who said anything about love?

1537
01:20:49.219 --> 01:20:52.929
She doesn’t have half
of the class

1538
01:20:53.057 --> 01:20:55.057
or the finesse that you do.

1539
01:20:55.184 --> 01:20:58.024
I would have been
a better partner.

1540
01:21:00.606 --> 01:21:02.356
You’re trying to manipulate me.

1541
01:21:02.441 --> 01:21:05.321
I’m trying to show you
that I want in.

1542
01:21:06.195 --> 01:21:08.415
We could disappear
to another country.

1543
01:21:08.530 --> 01:21:11.160
-Too risky.
-We would change our looks.

1544
01:21:11.241 --> 01:21:12.781
I’ve always wanted to be blonde

1545
01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:15.870
and you would look great
in a beard.

1546
01:21:18.457 --> 01:21:21.747
We could use
my real estate knowledge.

1547
01:21:21.835 --> 01:21:25.125
Break into vacation homes
when the owners aren’t there.

1548
01:21:25.255 --> 01:21:27.465
Show them like they’re listed
on the market.

1549
01:21:27.591 --> 01:21:30.091
I mean. Walker. we can make
so much more than the tens

1550
01:21:30.177 --> 01:21:32.467
of thousands you make
with women’s savings

1551
01:21:32.596 --> 01:21:34.346
and credit cards.

1552
01:21:36.266 --> 01:21:38.306
Please. untie me

1553
01:21:38.435 --> 01:21:41.395
so we can talk
like normal people.

1554
01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:44.860
Plus. I’m starving.

1555
01:21:44.942 --> 01:21:46.362
Do you have anything to eat?

1556
01:21:46.443 --> 01:21:48.453
I’ll get you some more water.

1557
01:21:54.451 --> 01:21:56.871
I might have something
in the cabinet.

1558
01:21:57.621 --> 01:22:01.171
[suspenseful music]

1559
01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:06.130
Yeah. I got. uh. bake beans.

1560
01:22:06.255 --> 01:22:07.765
-This should work.
-[Kate] Yeah.

1561
01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:11.260
I haven’t had breakfast.
so anything’s great.

1562
01:22:12.302 --> 01:22:13.512
Please.

Hello?

[muffled screams]

01:22:43.208 --> 01:22:45.038
Oh. my God.

1570
01:22:48.672 --> 01:22:51.722
-Oh. are you okay?
-I’m fine.

1571
01:22:51.842 --> 01:22:53.642
-My key is in the pocket.
-Oh.

1572
01:22:53.719 --> 01:22:56.389
-Where’s Kate?
-I don’t know.

1573
01:22:56.513 --> 01:22:59.643
I let myself in the house
and she’s not in there.

1574
01:22:59.725 --> 01:23:01.565
But her car’s in the driveway.

1575
01:23:01.685 --> 01:23:02.935
Have you tried calling her?

1576
01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:04.270
Oh.

01:23:37.804 --> 01:23:39.604
They’re looking for you now.

1583
01:23:41.016 --> 01:23:45.056
It’s time to approve
the transfer or else.

1584
01:23:45.187 --> 01:23:46.437
I’d rather not.

01:24:10.504 --> 01:24:12.764
[choking]

1590
01:24:21.723 --> 01:24:23.273
[grunts]

1591
01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:26.900

[Vivian]
Are you sure you’re okay?

1596
01:24:47.749 --> 01:24:49.129
Yeah. I’m sure.

1597
01:24:49.251 --> 01:24:50.881
Okay.

1598
01:24:50.961 --> 01:24:54.011
She was strong and held her own.

1599
01:24:54.131 --> 01:24:56.341
I can’t say the same for myself.

1600
01:24:56.466 --> 01:24:58.676
I should probably go back
to desk work.

1601
01:24:58.802 --> 01:24:59.842
[Kate] No.

1602
01:24:59.970 --> 01:25:01.810
It is not your fault.

1603
01:25:01.888 --> 01:25:05.978
He surprised us both
and we didn’t stand a chance.

1604
01:25:06.101 --> 01:25:09.101
Then you came
to rescue me just in time.

1605
01:25:10.522 --> 01:25:11.862
Any signs of him?

1606
01:25:11.982 --> 01:25:13.942
Well. The FBI has been notified.

1607
01:25:14.026 --> 01:25:16.606
Look. there are plenty
of people looking for him.

1608
01:25:16.695 --> 01:25:19.325
He can’t run forever.

1609
01:25:19.448 --> 01:25:20.868
You did it. Kate.

1610
01:25:20.991 --> 01:25:22.121
You got him.

1611
01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:24.160
Walker Stevenson will be caught

1612
01:25:24.244 --> 01:25:27.374
or he’s gonna have to hide out
from now on.

1613
01:25:27.497 --> 01:25:31.127
But he’s not gonna hurt
any more women thanks to you.

01:25:32.169 --> 01:25:35.299

1615
01:25:45.682 --> 01:25:48.522

[speaking French]

1617
01:25:56.526 --> 01:25:58.066
You speak English?

1618
01:25:58.195 --> 01:26:01.455
Yes. Much better
than my French. I’m afraid.

1619
01:26:02.449 --> 01:26:04.869
Well. you’re right
that these paintings.

1620
01:26:04.951 --> 01:26:06.621
they are all beautiful.

1621
01:26:06.703 --> 01:26:09.713
You know. the artist
created this whole series

1622
01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:11.751
before he died.

1623
01:26:11.875 --> 01:26:13.955
They found it in his studio.

1624
01:26:14.878 --> 01:26:15.878
I’m Jada.

1625
01:26:16.004 --> 01:26:18.014
Roger.

1626
01:26:18.090 --> 01:26:20.300
Roger Kane. It’s a...

1627
01:26:20.384 --> 01:26:22.344
it’s a pleasure to meet you.

1628
01:26:23.053 --> 01:26:25.143
So you know a lot about art?

1629
01:26:26.682 --> 01:26:27.972
Yeah.

1630
01:26:28.892 --> 01:26:30.312
Yeah. I know a little.

1631
01:26:30.394 --> 01:26:33.444
