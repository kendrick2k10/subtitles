00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.560
Cameras have always been
a part of our lives.

4
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.960
I think there's a difference
to watching a home movie

5
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.320
when you know who it is on
the other side of the lens.

6
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.200
holding the camera.

7
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.080
It adds to the sense of intimacy.

8
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.400
Like many families.

9
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.440
my parents wanted to keep a record
of our precious moments together.

10
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.840
And when it was our turn.
with our own family.

11
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.800
we did the same.

12
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.400
I always enjoyed capturing
family moments.

13
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.160
Private photos can often show
the fun behind the formality.

14
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.760
I expect just about every family

15
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.280
has a collection of
photographs or films

16
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.640
that were once regularly looked at
to recall precious moments.

17
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.680
but which over time are replaced
by newer images

18
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.160
and more recent memories.

19
00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.120
You always hope that future
generations

20
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.280
will find them interesting.

21
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.720
and perhaps be surprised
that you. too. were young once.

22
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.760
To look back is not necessarily
to be nostalgic.

23
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.240
Winston Churchill.
my first Prime Minister.

24
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.080
said that.
"The further backward you look.

25
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.360
"the further forward you can see."

26
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.680
I remember my own childhood.

27
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.480
My mother always gave me support
and encouragement.

28
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.160
She had an infectious zest
for living...

29
00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.040
..and an extraordinary capacity

30
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.000
to bring happiness into other
people's lives.

31
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.200
My father served in the Royal Navy
during the First World War.

32
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.800
He was a midshipman
in HMS Collingwood

33
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.440
at the Battle of Jutland in 1916.

34
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.680
The British fleet lost 14 ships
and 6.000 men in that engagement.

35
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.800
He wrote in a letter.

36
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.920
"How and why we were not hit
beats me."

37
00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.920
BELL TOLLS

38
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.720
Like others.
he lost friends in the War.

39
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.880
but. of course. we would not grieve
if we did not love.

40
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.600
In my experience.

41
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.080
the positive value of
a happy family

42
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.680
is one of the factors of human
existence that has not changed.

43
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.360
Faith. family and friendship

44
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.400
have been not only
a constant for me.

45
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.400
but a source of personal comfort
and reassurance.

46
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.000
My grandfather couldn't have known

47
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.120
what was in store
for his grandchildren.

48
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:34.600
Yet his faith in the future gave him
a quiet confidence

49
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.760
that the stern tests
would be overcome.

50
00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:02.400
GEORGE V:  I look forward to the
future with faith and hope.

51
00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:09.640
It is to the young
that the future belongs.

52
00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.200
and when the time comes.

53
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:17.000
be ready and proud
to give to your country

54
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.640
the service of your work.
your mind and your heart.

NEWSREEL:  Within eight months of

56

the Silver Jubilee.
King George lay dead.

57
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.240
King George V. greatly loved
and gratefully remembered.

58
00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.280
I have lived long enough

59
00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.520
to know that things never remain
quite the same for very long.

60
00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.200
No-one can make
history stand still.

61
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.000
Events and situations change
with startling speed.

62
00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.960
EDWARD VIII:  I have found it
impossible to carry the heavy burden

63
00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:57.560
of responsibility and to discharge
my duties as King

64
00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:01.720
without the help
and support of the woman I love.

65
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.040
This decision has been made less
difficult to me

66
00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.640
by the sure knowledge
that my brother.

67
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.680
with his fine qualities.

68
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.640

place forthwith.

69
00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:30.960
And he has one matchless blessing.

70
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:36.320
enjoyed by so many of you

71
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:41.720
and not bestowed on me -

72
00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.600
a happy home.

73
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:48.560
with his wife and children.

74
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:56.000
God bless you all.
God save the King.

CHEERING

76
00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.360
I remember my father making
me write down

77
00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.760
what I remembered
about his Coronation.

78
00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.800
It was very valuable.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.880
ACTOR READS:  We crouched

Millions cheering themselves hoarse
this glorious Coronation day.

85
00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:42.120
I cannot find words
with which to thank you

86
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:46.960
for your love and loyalty
to the Queen and myself.

87
00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.240
If. in the coming years.

88
00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:58.240
I can show my gratitude
in service to you.

89
00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:04.440
that is the way. above all others.

YOUNG ELIZABETH:
There are long periods

94
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.120
when life seems
a small. dull round...

95
00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:29.720
..and then. suddenly.
we are caught up in some great event

96
00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.240
which gives us a glimpse of the
solid and durable foundations

97
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.880

101
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.600
I thought it all very.
very wonderful

102
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:59.640
and. I expect. the Abbey did too.
as Papa was crowned.

103
00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.520

God save the King.
God save the King.

105
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:13.200
At the end. the service got rather
boring. as it was all prayers.

106
00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:17.480
Grannie and I were looking to see
how many more pages to the end.

107
00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.400
At the bottom of the page.
it said "Finis".

108
00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:28.280
We both smiled at each other
and turned back to the service.

GEORGE VI:  The Queen and I

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:50.640
I thank you from my heart.

and may God bless you all.

113
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.760
Balmoral is a place one looks
forward to very much.

114
00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:08.720
I think that it has
an atmosphere of its own.

115
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:19.960
Families so often treasure
their routines

116
00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:23.440
and embrace the roles.
traditions and values

117
00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.360
that mean so much to us.

118
00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.600
I see it in my own family.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.160

of great happiness.

profoundly troubled.

121
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:15.280

a special word of greeting

122
00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.560
to those of my listeners
who are young...

123
00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:26.120
..that the skies are overcast

all the amusements.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.200
Of course. the amateur
cameras were very busy.

And it is our relationship
with one another

Let us hope that this war
will not last long.

162

Some cultures believe
a long life brings wisdom.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.240
I'd like to think so.

164
00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.880
Perhaps part of that wisdom

165
00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.640
is to recognise some
of life's baffling paradoxes.

166
00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:43.480
Such as the way human beings
have a huge propensity for good

167
00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:48.520
and yet a capacity for evil.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.720
For the very first broadcast I made.

177
00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.920
helped by my sister.

178
00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:12.040
we spoke to children who had been
evacuated from their homes

179
00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.640
and sent away for their own safety.

180
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:21.160
YOUNG ELIZABETH: My sister. Margaret
Rose. and I feel so much for you.

181
00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:24.040
as we know from experience
what it means

182
00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:27.400
to be away from those we love
most of all.

183
00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.720
My sister is by my side

184
00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.960

going to say goodnight to you.

185

Come on. Margaret.

186
00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:39.440
Goodnight. children.

187
00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:42.360
Goodnight and good luck to you all.

188
00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.320
Darling Grannie.

189
00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.640
I am so glad you liked
the broadcast.

190
00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:54.360
Everyone has been saying
how like my voice is to Mummy's.

191
00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:59.120
We have all-night air-raid warnings
every night

192
00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:02.840
and the guns go occasionally.
and they make a very big noise.

193
00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:12.480
The War affected everyone...

194
00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.680

197
00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.680
this was the effect of
a time bomb that exploded

198
00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.560
in the grounds
of the King's London home.

199
00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.160
It fell close to
the King's sitting room.

Truly. this is a war of all
the people.

202
00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:41.320
poor old Buckingham Palace
looks very sad. with no windows

gone completely.

Buckingham Palace for the third time
is hit by Nazi bombs.

We thank God that Their Majesties
were unhurt.

208

The news of the war
has been very bad lately.

209
00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.000
But we will never give in.

Your very loving granddaughter.
Lilibet.

211
00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.400
It is not enough
simply to do our jobs.

212
00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.640

who lost his life on active service.

215
00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.800
The Duke. who was an airman
in his own right.

216
00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:45.040
had undertaken duties concerning
the welfare of RAF personnel

217
00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:48.520
and was on his way to Iceland
when the crash occurred.

218
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:57.040
Many people have had to cope
with family loss...

219
00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:02.120
..sometimes in the most tragic
of circumstances.

220
00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.000
Darling Grannie.

221
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.240
it was so very sad
about poor Uncle George.

222
00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.560
His death was such an awful shock

223
00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:31.640
and we will all miss him
a great deal.

224
00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:35.480
He was always so very kind to us.

225
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:52.480
We sometimes think
the world's problems are so big

226
00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.440
that we can do little to help.

227
00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:08.400
On our own. we cannot end wars
or wipe out injustice.

228
00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:18.360
But the cumulative impact of
thousands of small acts of goodness

229
00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.840
can be bigger than we imagine.

of the Empire.

233

of which he is Commander-in-chief.

234
00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:56.840
By his visits to his forces.
my father brought encouragement

235
00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:00.640
to those who had long been parted
from their homes and families.

236
00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:06.480
He was the living symbol
of our steadfastness.

237
00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:12.480
He never wavered in his faith
that. with God's help.

238
00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.560
the cause of freedom would prevail.

239
00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:27.320
In a broadcast to the nation.
my father said.

240
00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:30.320
"What is demanded from us all

241
00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:34.880
"is something more than
courage and endurance."

242
00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:39.080
GEORGE VI:  We need
a revival of spirit.

243
00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:43.360
a new. unconquerable resolve.

244
00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:52.080
I remember waiting for
the Prime Minister's announcement

245
00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.280
of the end of the war in Europe.

246
00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:59.680
CHURCHILL:  Hostilities
will end officially

at one minute after midnight
tonight. Tuesday the 8th of May.

248
00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:11.960
We may allow ourselves
a brief period of rejoicing.

249
00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.920
We kept faith
that the cause was right.

250
00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:21.680
and this belief carried us through.

251
00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:26.160
Never give up. never despair -
that was the message of VE Day.

252
00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:30.200
I vividly remember
the jubilant scenes

253
00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:34.920
my sister and I witnessed with
our parents and Winston Churchill

254
00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:37.400
from the balcony
of Buckingham Palace.

255
00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:41.880
The sense of joy in the crowds
who'd gathered outside

256
00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.440
and across the country
was profound.

257
00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:04.040
My sister and I realised we couldn't
see what the crowds were enjoying.

258
00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:09.040
so we asked my parents if we could
go out and see for ourselves.

259
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.320
I remember we were terrified
of being recognised.

260
00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:20.280
I pulled my uniform cap
well down over my eyes.

261
00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:31.360
We walked miles through the streets.
I remember lines of unknown people.

262
00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:34.080
linking arms
and walking down Whitehall.

263
00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:39.160
all of us just swept along
on a tide of happiness and relief.

264
00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:44.280
I think it was one of the most
memorable nights of my life.

265
00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:46.360
My father expressed undiminished
hope and trust in the future.

266

GEORGE VI:  Have faith
in life at its best

267
00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:56.320
and bring to it your courage.

268
00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:00.600
your hopes
and your sense of humour.

the beginning of
the biggest adventure of her life.

282

for she has never been
abroad before.

holiday. but she is the future Queen

I and all my family have always felt

287
00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:24.400
that one of
our most important duties is

288
00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:27.120
to express in our visits overseas

We share the same world...

303

..but we do not share
the same opportunities.

304
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:53.080
A tolerant society actively develops
the people who belong to it

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:57.800
and enriches their lives
because it values their diversity.

306

contact between its peoples.

308
00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:21.840

This relationship between two

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:04.120
watching wild game.

517
01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:08.000
About as far removed from
normal civilisation as possible.

518
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.720
How tragic to think that at such
a moment. she should become Queen.

519
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.640
There is no magic formula that will
transform sorrow into happiness.

520
01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.640
I rely on my own faith

521
01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:37.280
to guide me through
the good times and the bad.

522
01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:44.800
It was a tragic homecoming.

523
01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:49.400
On the same spot where. a week ago.
there had been a happy departure.

524
01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:52.800
there stepped down from the plane
a figure in mourning.

525
01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:55.520
Elizabeth II. Queen of this realm

526
01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:58.680
and of all her other realms
and territories.

527
01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:01.840
Head of the Commonwealth.
Defender of the Faith.

528
01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:10.080
When all your world is torn
with grief and strife.

529
01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.360
think yet.

530
01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:15.600
When there seems nothing left
to mend the frail

531
01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:19.000
and timeworn fabric of your life.

532
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.440
the golden thread
of courage has no end.

533
01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:20.040
In a way.
I didn't have an apprenticeship.

534
01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:21.880
My father died much too young.

535
01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:29.280
It was all a very sudden kind of...

536
01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:33.520
..taking on
and making the best job you can.

537
01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:57.400
ARCHIVE:  15 years ago. a little girl
who called herself Lilibet

538
01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:00.320
wrote her own account
of Coronation morning.

539
01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:04.240
Today. the writer of these lines

540
01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:07.000
is about to come forth
from Buckingham Palace.

541
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.640
a young mother and a reigning Queen.

542
01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:14.400
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

543
01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:19.160
Each day is a new beginning.

544
01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:23.240
I know that the only way
to live my life

545
01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:25.720
is to try to do what is right.

546
01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:27.720
to take the long view.

547
01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:30.720
to give of my best
in all that the day brings.

548
01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:32.640
and to put my trust in God.

549
01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:41.040
Whether we believe in God or not.

550
01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:43.920
I think most of us have
a sense of the spiritual...

551
01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:50.240
..that recognition of a deeper
meaning and purpose in our lives.

552
01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:53.800
And I believe that
this sense flourishes

553
01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:55.880
despite the pressures of our world.

554
01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:01.120
ARCHIVE:  The words echo out of
the history of the land.

555
01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:04.600
We have resolved by the favour
and blessing of Almighty God

556
01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:08.360
to celebrate the solemnity of
our Royal Coronation

557
01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:12.880
upon Tuesday. the second day of June
in the Year of Grace 1953.

558
01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:17.480
The Coronation of Her Royal Majesty
Queen Elizabeth II.

559
01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:23.760
It's a question of maturing
into something

560
01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:26.680
that one's got used to doing.

561
01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:31.400
and accepting the fact that here you
are and it's your fate.

562
01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:37.040
Because I think
continuity's very important.

563
01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:40.360
It is a job for life.

564
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.880
The years have slipped
by so quickly.

565
01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.840
There is no point
in regretting the passage of time.

566
01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:27.880
Growing older is
one of the facts of life.

567
01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:36.480
And it has its own compensations.

568
01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:54.480
One of the joys of living a long
life is watching one's children.

569
01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.880
Then grandchildren.

570
01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:13.320
We can't be certain
what lies ahead for them.

571
01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:20.760
But we should know enough
to put them on the right path.

572
01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:25.600
We can do this if we have
the good sense to learn

573
01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:28.680
from the experience of
those who've gone before us.

574
01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:45.520
ARCHIVE:  Queen Elizabeth
going forth to her crowning.

575
01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:49.520
I don't know that anyone had
invented the term platinum for

576
01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:52.880
a 70th anniversary when I was born.

577
01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:55.400
You weren't expected
to be around that long.

578
01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:57.960
CHEERING

579
01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:03.320
I mean. I've seen one coronation

580
01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:07.680
and been the recipient in the other.
which is pretty remarkable.

581
01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:14.400
CHOIR:  # Vivat Regina

582
01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:18.200
# Vivat Regina Elizabetha

583
01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:22.400
# Vivat! Vivat! Vivat! #

584
01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:24.800
It's a pageant of chivalry

585
01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:28.920
and an old-fashioned way
of doing things. I think. really.

586
01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:32.040
but it's quite interesting
to have it done again.

587
01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:38.280
God crown you with
a crown of glory and righteousness.

588
01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:40.240
that having a right faith

589
01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:42.800
and manifold fruit of good works.

590
01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:47.080
you may obtain the crown
of an everlasting kingdom

591
01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:51.560
by the gift of him
whose kingdom endureth for ever.

592
01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:53.840
Amen.  Amen.

593
01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:58.720
ALL:  God save the Queen.
God save the Queen.

594
01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:00.400
God save the Queen.

595
01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:03.000
FANFARE PLAYS

596
01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:09.280
I here present unto you

597
01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:12.560
Queen Elizabeth.
your undoubted queen.

598
01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:19.600
It's inevitable that I should seem
a rather remote figure

599
01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:21.360
to many of you.

600
01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:25.520
A successor to the kings
and queens of history.

601
01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:30.560
someone whose face may be
familiar in newspapers and films.

602
01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:33.400
but who never really touches
your personal lives.

603
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.360
In the old days.

604
01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:43.240
the monarch led his soldiers
on the battlefield

605
01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:47.200
and his leadership at all times
was close and personal.

606
01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:52.640
I cannot lead you into battle.

607
01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:57.120
I do not give you laws.

608
01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:58.600
or administer justice.

609
01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:01.760
But I can do something else.

610
01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:06.120
I can give you my heart

611
01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:09.080
and my devotion
to these old islands.

612
01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:12.480
and to all the peoples
of our brotherhood of nations.

613
01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:31.040
I hope my Platinum Jubilee
will be an opportunity

614
01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:36.120
for people everywhere to enjoy
a sense of togetherness.

615
01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:38.520
a chance to give thanks for

616
01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:42.320
the enormous changes
of the last 70 years.

617
01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:45.360
and also to look ahead
with confidence.

618
01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:21.040
Over the years. I have tried
to follow my father's example

619
01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:23.000
and to serve you as best I can.
