00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:44.586
Sid: This is a story
of life and death.

4
00:00:44.586 --> 00:00:46.547
Specifically. one life
and one death.

5
00:00:48.924 --> 00:00:52.344
More specifically. mine.

6
00:00:58.934 --> 00:01:01.728
My name is Sid Sandagger.
and I have figured out

7
00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:03.939
the key
to a long and happy life.

8
00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:09.319
It's quite simple.
Don't mess with the system.
Think about it.

9
00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:12.155
Every awful thing
that happens to someone
in their life.

10
00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:14.575
it can be chalked up
to them ripping at the fabric

11
00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:17.953
of the social continuum.
So don't.

12
00:01:17.953 --> 00:01:19.663
There's a natural order
to things in life.

13
00:01:19.663 --> 00:01:21.248
and it is not
to be reckoned with.

14
00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:23.000
And nowhere
is that more important

15
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.128
than the one environment
more strict.

16
00:01:26.128 --> 00:01:28.589
more brutal. and more savage

17
00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:31.592
than all of the rest--
high school.

18
00:01:31.592 --> 00:01:35.929
Luckily. I've developed
three simple rules
to ensure survival.

19
00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:40.058
Rule number one?
Shut up.

20
00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:41.393
Most people
don't get beaten up

21
00:01:41.393 --> 00:01:43.437
for what they don't say.

22
00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:48.358
Rule number two.
don't stand out.

23
00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:52.613
This applies to everything.
from what you wear.
to who your friends are.

24
00:01:52.613 --> 00:01:55.282
to what extra-curriculars
you're a part of.

25
00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:59.369
I have mastered
the art of the nondescript
extra-curricular.

26
00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.997
For example. I'm comptroller

27
00:02:01.997 --> 00:02:04.082
for the Eastland High
student council.

28
00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:07.461
understudy
for the school play...

00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:10.339

30
00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:13.217

Hey. yo. Incoming!

32

...and starter for

33

E-sports. need I say more?

34
00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:24.978
Midnight tonight. boys.
You excited. Cunningham?

35
00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:27.856
I hacked into
my parents' internet account
to upgrade our speed.

36
00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:31.777
- Sweet.
- Also. I think my parents
are getting divorced.

37
00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:41.453
And finally. the third
and most important rule.

38
00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:45.457
Don't fuck with Chuck.

39
00:02:45.457 --> 00:02:48.460
Chuck Brawnte.
him and his stupid friends

40
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.046
have a few thousand
subscribers to their
YouTube channel.

41
00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:53.465
which. believe it or not.
people actually
give a shit about.

42
00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:55.467
Whoo! Fuck you. window!

43
00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:57.803
But the real reason everybody
knows who Chuck Brawnte is...

44
00:02:57.803 --> 00:03:00.472
- Are you boys okay over here?
- Pussy bitch!

45
00:03:00.472 --> 00:03:02.641
...is because
he is super violent.

46
00:03:02.641 --> 00:03:04.518
- Come on. Let's go.
let's go. let's go.
- Here's the big one.

47
00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:06.436
Chuck got kicked out
of his old school

48
00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:09.314
for beating a freshmen
nearly to death.

49
00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:11.859
The kid is still in a coma.
Now I'm not a lawyer.

50
00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.027
but allow me to present
these three facts.

51
00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:18.824
One. Chuck got off
with a few hours
of community service.

52
00:03:18.824 --> 00:03:21.076
Two. Chuck's dad
is super rich

53
00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:24.288
because he owns
all the Mercedes dealerships
in upstate New York.

54
00:03:24.288 --> 00:03:27.499
And three. the judge
hearing Chuck's case

55
00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:30.085
now drives a top of the line
Mercedes Benz.

56
00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:32.212
Get the picture?

57
00:03:41.138 --> 00:03:42.139
Fuh...

58
00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:43.932

- Hey.

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:35.943
To me that said.
"Fuck off. Moms.
but I love you."

75
00:04:35.943 --> 00:04:40.447
- No.
- If he was half-Korean.
this would not be happening.

76
00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:45.035
Sid: School was great.
I woke up. I went to class.
and then I came home.

77
00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:46.537
It was perfectly predictable.

78
00:04:46.537 --> 00:04:49.164
which is
perfectly acceptable.

79
00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:51.583
As long as
I stick to my rules.

80
00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:53.168
much like
my internet search history.

81
00:04:53.168 --> 00:04:54.586
high school will be a filthy.

82
00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:57.464
nasty. amoral blip
on my radar

83
00:04:57.464 --> 00:05:01.593
that someday will
never have even happened.

84
00:05:01.593 --> 00:05:04.388
Life is about
embracing routine.

85
00:05:04.388 --> 00:05:06.014
- Oh.
- Eat. sleep. play.

86
00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:07.724
It's gonna be a good night.

87
00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:10.102
That is. of course.
except when a new edition

88
00:05:10.102 --> 00:05:12.354
of War Monger comes out.

89
00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:14.314
It's a sacred night.

90
00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:15.816
And on this night.

91
00:05:15.816 --> 00:05:17.609
you don't eat.
you don't sleep.

92
00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:19.611
and you sit at your altar
for hours on end

93
00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:21.196
just praying to stay alive.

94
00:05:23.824 --> 00:05:25.784
It's pure heaven.

95
00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:34.168
Then the semen travels
through the vas deferens.

96
00:05:34.168 --> 00:05:37.421
out the urethra.
and hopefully into the vagina

97
00:05:37.421 --> 00:05:39.423
of someone you're
not just using for sex

98
00:05:39.423 --> 00:05:40.632
and that you're willing
to stick around

99
00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:42.176
and raise the baby with.

100
00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:45.429
Or into an anus.

101
00:05:45.429 --> 00:05:47.014
Any questions?

102
00:05:47.014 --> 00:05:49.850
Oh. my God. dude.
Sex Ed is such bullshit.

103
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.226
Like. I don't understand

104
00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:53.020
why we spend
so much time on condoms.

105
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.022
What is there to know?
You open the shit up.

106
00:05:55.022 --> 00:05:56.273
you stick your junk in it.
and you go to town on somebody.

107
00:05:56.273 --> 00:05:57.900
Sid:My best friend Jim Vega.

108
00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.651
Jim cares about two things.

109
00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:01.862
getting laid
and being popular.

110
00:06:01.862 --> 00:06:03.906
and so far
he's achieved neither.

111
00:06:03.906 --> 00:06:05.657
Do they seriously
think dudes are. like.

112
00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:07.784
sticking their balls
in it or something?

113
00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:11.496
You'd be surprised.
What do you want
them to teach?

114
00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:13.040
- Like. I don't know.
- Heads up!

115
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.042
Why don't they teach us
how to fuck awesome?

116
00:06:15.042 --> 00:06:17.878
'Cause it's Sex Ed.
It's not sex class.

117
00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:20.088
Yeah. but what's the difference?
And unlike trigonometry.

118
00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:22.674
this would be. like. practical.
applicable knowledge.

119
00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:25.469
Just talk to
the school board
about it. man.

120
00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:28.472
- Wait. you-- you think so?
- Yeah. why not?

121
00:06:28.472 --> 00:06:30.891
You go to the school board
and you say.

122
00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:33.227
"Ladies and gentlemen.
I would like my teachers

123
00:06:33.227 --> 00:06:35.354
- to teach me
how to fuck awesome."
- I'm serious.

124
00:06:35.354 --> 00:06:37.272
Like. how do you
find the clitoris during
over the pants sex stuff?

125
00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:40.692
Can you not say fucking
"clitoris" in the hallway?

126
00:06:40.692 --> 00:06:42.861
You see. this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

127
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:45.906
Everyone is so horny that
yelling "clit" in the hall

128
00:06:45.906 --> 00:06:47.783
is like yelling fire
in a theater.

129
00:06:47.783 --> 00:06:50.244
Yeah. and you don't yell fire
in a fucking theater.

130
00:06:50.244 --> 00:06:54.957
Regardless.
the clitoris is at the top
of the labia minora.

131
00:06:54.957 --> 00:06:57.501
That sophomore
with the cleft lip?

132
00:06:57.501 --> 00:06:59.503
No. that's Lydia Mindlin.

133
00:06:59.503 --> 00:07:01.505
Yo. Rafi! What's up. man?

134
00:07:01.505 --> 00:07:02.840
- How you doing?
How was that test?
- Who are you?

135
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.426
All right.
Rafi's the best.

136
00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:08.929
- You really shouldn't do that.
- Why? Rafi's my homie.

137
00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:10.722
Rafi's not your fucking homie.

138
00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:13.058
He just tolerates you
because you let him
cheat off you once.

139
00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:14.518
You're just jealous
'cause I'm popular.

140
00:07:14.518 --> 00:07:16.520
- You're not fucking popular.
- Okay.

141
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.188
- And that's a blessing.
- Oh. come on.

142
00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:19.398
Don't start with your whole

143
00:07:19.398 --> 00:07:21.316
"don't mess with the system"
bullshit.

144
00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:23.735
- You're just afraid
to live a little.
- I live.

145
00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:27.114
What do you call
an all-nighter
playing World Of--

146
00:07:27.114 --> 00:07:30.117
Whoa-ly shit. Tiff Mann.

147
00:07:30.117 --> 00:07:33.120
I don't think I've talked
to Tiff Mann since our
figure skating recital

148
00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.247
when I was eight years old.

149
00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:45.924
I've been in love with her
the entire time since.

150
00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:49.052
but it's clear
that she didn't exactly

151
00:07:49.052 --> 00:07:51.388
see me as boyfriend material.

152
00:07:51.388 --> 00:07:53.515
I've told you.
no sleepovers at boys' houses.

153
00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:56.143
But. Mom. it's just Sid's.

154
00:07:56.143 --> 00:07:57.477
Come to think of it.
neither did her mom.

155
00:07:57.477 --> 00:08:00.731
Oh. that's fine.

156
00:08:00.731 --> 00:08:02.774
Even more fucked up
than that.

157
00:08:02.774 --> 00:08:04.776
Tiff Mann is dating Chuck.

158
00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:07.988
Yo.

159
00:08:07.988 --> 00:08:09.198
Chuck: Wanna go to
the parking lot right now?

160
00:08:09.198 --> 00:08:11.241
- How was class?
- Sucks.

161
00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:13.410
Mr. Ramirez can literally
lick my butthole.

162
00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:15.621
Suck a dick. Chuck.

163
00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:18.874
All right. class. let's go!

164
00:08:18.874 --> 00:08:22.294
- Two laps around the field!
- Oh. my God.

165
00:08:22.294 --> 00:08:26.590
Dude. do you think
Juliana Ulrich would be down
for a finger in the butt?

166
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:28.800
Teacher:
Good speed! Keep it up!

167
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.011
I really don't think
girls are as into that
as you think they are.

168
00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:32.971
Are you kidding me?
It's a second G-spot.

169
00:08:32.971 --> 00:08:35.015
And I'm usually pretty good
at telling who would be down.

170
00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:37.809
I'm like the Finger
In The Butt Whisperer.

171
00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:40.020
You know who probably sticks
a bunch of fingers in butts?

172
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.856
- Teacher: Two more laps!
- Chuck. Chuck is the man.

173
00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:44.733
Did you see his latest video?

174
00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:47.152
He totally wrecked
Su-Ming Lee's car
with a pogo stick.

175
00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:50.822
- Chuck's a fucking monster.
- Jim. Jim! Hey.

176
00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:52.824
You haven't told me
what color tie you're
wearing to homecoming.

177
00:08:52.824 --> 00:08:54.409
That's 'cause
I'm not going with you. Luna.

178
00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:56.620
Sid:Meet Luna Peralta.

179
00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.413
Luna and Jim have
known each other since
they were in diapers.

180
00:08:58.413 --> 00:09:00.624
and have hated each other
just as long.

181
00:09:00.624 --> 00:09:02.251
Luna does not hold back.

182
00:09:02.251 --> 00:09:04.211
You think I wanna go with you?

183
00:09:04.211 --> 00:09:05.796
Here's a list
of inanimate objects

184
00:09:05.796 --> 00:09:07.381
I would rather take to
Homecoming than you. okay?

185
00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:09.633
Bleach. a bottle of urine.

186
00:09:09.633 --> 00:09:12.094
and rusty nails literally
stuck in my hands.

187
00:09:12.094 --> 00:09:14.847
- Glad we're on the same page.
- My crazy parents only
want me to go with you

188
00:09:14.847 --> 00:09:16.723
'cause they know I'm not
gonna come back pregnant.

189
00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:19.268
Great. Not happening.
Leave me alone. I have herpes.

190
00:09:19.268 --> 00:09:21.854
You wish you had herpes.
That would have to mean
someone touched

191
00:09:21.854 --> 00:09:23.856
- your skinny
little micro-penis.
- It's not skinny.

192
00:09:23.856 --> 00:09:25.691
If anything. girth is my asset
and length is my weakness.

193
00:09:25.691 --> 00:09:26.859
- Okay.
- So fuck off.

194
00:09:26.859 --> 00:09:28.652
Buddy. nothing is your asset.

195
00:09:28.652 --> 00:09:30.863
and being a fuckwad
is your weakness.

196
00:09:30.863 --> 00:09:32.656
Later. shrimp dick.

197
00:09:32.656 --> 00:09:34.074
- She is so mean.
- I know.

198
00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:35.993
- Teacher: Sandagger. Vega!
- I love it.

199
00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:50.799
- Oh. come on. babe.
- Hey! Hold it.

200
00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:52.676
- What's up?
- Oh.

201
00:09:52.676 --> 00:09:56.263
- Oh. You look awful.
- I'm just tired.

202
00:09:56.263 --> 00:10:00.475
- We got an email.
A parent-y email.
- Yes.

203
00:10:00.475 --> 00:10:06.064
Uh. "Please ensure
proper Homecoming attire."
blah blah blah.

204
00:10:06.064 --> 00:10:10.611
Were you planning on
wearing a very short skirt
to this dance?

205
00:10:10.611 --> 00:10:13.071
Why is this the first time
we're hearing about
this Homecoming?

206
00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:16.533
- 'Cause I'm not going.
- Why not?

207
00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:18.452
Homecoming is a very big deal.

208
00:10:18.452 --> 00:10:20.329
You get all dressed up.
and you wait for some schnook

209
00:10:20.329 --> 00:10:22.289
to pick you up.
and you dance at arm's length.

210
00:10:22.289 --> 00:10:24.249
and then you have
a fleeting sexual encounter.

211
00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:27.336
- And then you realize
that you're a lesbian.
- Yes.

212
00:10:27.336 --> 00:10:28.921
Have you thought
about that. Sid?

213
00:10:28.921 --> 00:10:30.881
You might be a lesbian
and not even know it.

214
00:10:30.881 --> 00:10:33.383
- You do like Brandy Carlile.
- And going to Maine.

215
00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:36.595
- Mm. the signs are all there.
- Come on.

216
00:10:36.595 --> 00:10:38.889
Why aren't you going?

217
00:10:40.474 --> 00:10:43.227
That was a pretty
compelling argument.

218
00:10:43.227 --> 00:10:44.353
Come on.

219
00:10:44.353 --> 00:10:46.480
Think about it.

220
00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.818
You don't want to
graduate high school
without any memories.

221
00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:54.947
Actually. I have no problem
leaving high school
without any memories.

222
00:10:54.947 --> 00:10:57.157
I can't imagine
any experience good enough

223
00:10:57.157 --> 00:10:59.326
to risk the possibility
of a bad one.

224
00:10:59.326 --> 00:11:02.037
It's like why I don't have
my driver's license.

225
00:11:06.542 --> 00:11:08.544
And what's so bad about this?

226
00:11:08.544 --> 00:11:10.546
A 72-hour War Monger marathon

227
00:11:10.546 --> 00:11:12.965
is pretty awesome and safe.

228
00:11:15.217 --> 00:11:17.344
Game on. baby.

229
00:11:17.344 --> 00:11:21.181
Okay. well. maybe 72 hours
isn't entirely safe.

230
00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:25.561
According to Google.
there are seven specific
signs of sleep deprivation

231
00:11:25.561 --> 00:11:27.437
that all lead
to complete madness.

232
00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:28.772
Heads up. Tiny Tim.

233
00:11:28.772 --> 00:11:30.899
Ow. Stupid hemorrhoid.

234
00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:32.860
Look alive. fuckface.

235
00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:37.197
Oh. God. Dude. slow down.

236
00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:38.866
What happened to
no carbs till college?

237
00:11:38.866 --> 00:11:42.202
Symptom number one.
you eat a lot.

238
00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:44.580
- I'm fricking starving.
- Oh. pop quiz.

239
00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.790
Okay. so you're
driving home from a party
and you can't drive.

240
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.042
What do you take?
Uber or Lyft?

241
00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:51.587
Symptom number two.
you're indecisive.

242
00:11:51.587 --> 00:11:56.008
- I don't know.
- Lyft. 'cause their drivers
are super hot.

243
00:11:56.008 --> 00:11:57.759
Plus. Uber is for fascists.

244
00:11:57.759 --> 00:11:59.803
Symptom number three.
you forget things.

245
00:11:59.803 --> 00:12:01.805
- What are we talking about?
- I'm open. I'm open!

246
00:12:01.805 --> 00:12:03.932
Symptom number four?
Delayed motor skills.

247
00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:05.642
- Come on. come on.
- Go. go. go. go. go!

248
00:12:05.642 --> 00:12:08.312
Symptom number five.
your pain receptors are...

249
00:12:08.312 --> 00:12:09.646
- Heads up!
- ...diminished.

250
00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:13.150
Sorry!

251
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:17.738
Symptom number six.
your senses get all weird.

252
00:12:17.738 --> 00:12:21.450
And the final symptom
of sleep deprivation

253
00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:25.245
leading to complete madness.
you lose your filter.

254
00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:26.622
Suck a dick. Chuck.

255
00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:31.210
What did you just say?

256
00:12:35.506 --> 00:12:38.634
- Come on.
- What the fuck did you
just say to me?

257
00:12:39.927 --> 00:12:43.847
Um. I said. uh.

258
00:12:43.847 --> 00:12:47.434
I said suck--
suck her lick. Chuck.

259
00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:50.562
I want you guys
to enjoy kissing each other.

260
00:12:50.562 --> 00:12:52.439
'cause. you know. like.
we're not gonna be
young forever.

261
00:12:52.439 --> 00:12:55.859
Uh. I didn't say
that second part.
but I thought it.

262
00:12:55.859 --> 00:12:58.612
Uh. what I said. uh...

263
00:13:00.864 --> 00:13:03.450
I said. "Suck a dick."

264
00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:07.412
Suck a dick.
you pogo stick-riding douchebag.

265
00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:10.207
You think everyone's
afraid of you? Why?

266
00:13:10.207 --> 00:13:13.377
Because you look like
one of those punching bags
shaped like a torso?

267
00:13:17.089 --> 00:13:19.132
Jimenez. my good man.

268
00:13:19.132 --> 00:13:20.968
I'm not his man.
I don't even know
who the hell he is.

269
00:13:20.968 --> 00:13:23.804
- We ride.
- You remember three rules

270
00:13:23.804 --> 00:13:25.472
to getting through
high school alive?

271
00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:30.018
Shut up. don't stand out.
don't fuck with Chuck?

272
00:13:30.018 --> 00:13:32.271
Well. this is what happens
when you break all three

273
00:13:32.271 --> 00:13:37.484
of those rules
in the exact same moment.

274
00:13:38.819 --> 00:13:40.487
Motherfucker.
Tell me another joke.

275
00:13:40.487 --> 00:13:42.990
Tell me another fucking joke.
Huh? Was it worth it?

276
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:46.159
- I really fucking hope
it was worth it.
- Break it up!

277
00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:48.829
- I'm gonna kill you. kid.
I'm gonna fucking kill you.
- Ow!

278
00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:53.792
- Oh! Oh. oh!
- I am going to end your
goddamn miserable life.

279
00:13:53.792 --> 00:13:59.256
- Come here. kid. Come here.
- The next time I see you.
you are fucking dead.

280
00:13:59.256 --> 00:14:01.842
- Get the fuck off me!
- Are you okay?

281
00:14:01.842 --> 00:14:03.969
Chuck:
...fuck off me. God damn it!

282
00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:14.938
This is fucking fantastic.

283
00:14:14.938 --> 00:14:16.732
I've never seen
something like this.

284
00:14:16.732 --> 00:14:19.735
I mean. terrible--
oh. dude. you're up.

285
00:14:19.735 --> 00:14:21.987
This is a fascinating
porn collection.

286
00:14:21.987 --> 00:14:23.947
How long have I been out?

287
00:14:23.947 --> 00:14:27.159
Dude. you've been out for.
like. seven hours. Here.

288
00:14:27.159 --> 00:14:29.912
The nurse said
that you were gonna sleep
for a really long time.

289
00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:36.043
- What about Chuck?
- So Luna texted me.

290
00:14:36.043 --> 00:14:38.545
I don't even know how
she got through to me
because I blocked her number.

291
00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:42.216
but she said that Chuck
is only gonna be suspended
for 2 1/2 weeks.

292
00:14:42.216 --> 00:14:44.635
- That's it?
- Plus anger management
counseling.

293
00:14:46.178 --> 00:14:47.888
I have two weeks to live.

294
00:14:47.888 --> 00:14:51.350
2 1/2 weeks actually.
So. what? Today's--

295
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:56.188
Today's Wednesday.
so he's suspended
until the 25th.

296
00:14:56.188 --> 00:14:58.649
Aw. damn it.
That's the day of
the Homecoming dance.

297
00:14:58.649 --> 00:15:00.859
It's not like you need
another reason not to go.

298
00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:04.196
You all right? Sid?

299
00:15:04.196 --> 00:15:05.739
Dude. what are
you thinking about?

300
00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:07.407
- Sid: Death.
- I'm gonna kill you.

301
00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:10.786
I broke my rules.
I fucked with the system.

302
00:15:10.786 --> 00:15:12.496
and this is what I deserve.

303
00:15:12.496 --> 00:15:14.998
Chuck is gonna kill me.
and who's gonna stop him?

304
00:15:14.998 --> 00:15:18.794
Not the police.
not the school.
not the courts.

305
00:15:18.794 --> 00:15:20.671
No one ever has.

306
00:15:20.671 --> 00:15:23.549
Sid. you still awake?

307
00:15:29.012 --> 00:15:33.892
Jim told me you two
called out sick from work.

308
00:15:33.892 --> 00:15:35.394
You feeling okay?

309
00:15:43.652 --> 00:15:44.611
Hmm.

310
00:15:47.614 --> 00:15:50.576
Oh. I get it. Boundaries.

311
00:16:13.682 --> 00:16:17.060
Sid: This can't be it.
This can't be how it ends.

312
00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.437
I've gotta find out
where Chuck is

313
00:16:18.437 --> 00:16:19.855
and explain what happened.

314
00:16:19.855 --> 00:16:21.398
He'll understand.

315
00:16:21.398 --> 00:16:22.900
Well. obviously this would
work a little bit better

316
00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.944
if I had a banana
that wasn't quite so ripe.

317
00:16:25.944 --> 00:16:27.863
But I can't find
the demo banana.

318
00:16:27.863 --> 00:16:28.906
so I just took this
out of my lunch.

319
00:16:28.906 --> 00:16:30.657
Dude. did you hear?

320
00:16:30.657 --> 00:16:33.076
Chuck's parents sent him
to some anger management class

321
00:16:33.076 --> 00:16:34.703
during his suspension
in. like. Switzerland?

322
00:16:34.703 --> 00:16:36.079
It turns out the Swiss

323
00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:38.665
are masters
of not giving a fuck.

324
00:16:38.665 --> 00:16:42.085
It sounds dope. and rich.
and you can ski there.

325
00:16:42.085 --> 00:16:45.088
- Maybe he'll forgive you.
- And inside the condom...

326
00:16:45.088 --> 00:16:48.091
Mm. no. you're probably right.

327
00:16:48.091 --> 00:16:51.386
- He's probably gonna
murder you. Sorry. dawg.
- All right. question.

328
00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:55.849
What is the only 100% effective
method of contraception?

329
00:16:55.849 --> 00:16:58.810
- Butt stuff.
- No. that's not it.

330
00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:00.687
- Double condoms.
- No.

331
00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:02.314
- Dry humping.
- Abstinence.

332
00:17:02.314 --> 00:17:04.608
It's written--
it's literally on
the board behind me.

333
00:17:04.608 --> 00:17:07.361
Now. Candace is your
student abstinence leader.

334
00:17:07.361 --> 00:17:10.030
so she's agreed
to share her experience

335
00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.616
or. well. lack thereof.

336
00:17:12.616 --> 00:17:15.619
So. as you guys know.

337
00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:17.496
I have taken
the abstinence pledge.

338
00:17:17.496 --> 00:17:19.289
I'm in Sex Ed.
and I'm gonna die a virgin.

339
00:17:19.289 --> 00:17:20.874
What are they gonna write
on my tombstone?

340
00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:23.335
"Here lies Sid Sandagger.
He shrugged."

341
00:17:23.335 --> 00:17:25.254
What's wrong with me?
Was this really my life?

342
00:17:25.254 --> 00:17:26.964
I can't die like this.

343
00:17:26.964 --> 00:17:29.132
Is this why my moms
want me to make memories?

344
00:17:29.132 --> 00:17:31.969
In case some psycho
with a YouTube channel
pounds me to death

345
00:17:31.969 --> 00:17:33.512
on the dance floor
at Homecoming

346
00:17:33.512 --> 00:17:36.139
to a Taylor Swift ballad?
I'm sick of it!

347
00:17:36.139 --> 00:17:37.349
And this abstinence queen
going on

348
00:17:37.349 --> 00:17:39.142
and on and on and on

349
00:17:39.142 --> 00:17:41.103
- and on and--
- Fuck that.

350
00:17:41.103 --> 00:17:42.062
Sid?

351
00:17:44.731 --> 00:17:47.818
- I'm sorry.
- Candace. please continue.

352
00:17:47.818 --> 00:17:51.154
I'm sorry that
I've wasted so much time
in this dumb class.

353
00:17:51.154 --> 00:17:53.574
Excuse me. Sid Sandagger!

354
00:17:53.574 --> 00:17:55.325
Candace. I'm sorry for
interrupting you. but come on.

355
00:17:55.325 --> 00:17:57.953
Be honest with yourself.
Aren't you tired of lying?

356
00:17:57.953 --> 00:18:02.916
Have you ever dealt
with unhealthy. unclean urges

357
00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:05.294
or impure thoughts?

358
00:18:05.294 --> 00:18:07.546
At this very moment.

359
00:18:07.546 --> 00:18:10.716
Do you know what I think about
on a daily basis?

360
00:18:10.716 --> 00:18:12.384
It would traumatize you.

361
00:18:12.384 --> 00:18:13.844
And then I search it
on the internet.

362
00:18:13.844 --> 00:18:14.970
and it exists
and there's porn for it.

363
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:16.388
That means I'm not alone.

364
00:18:16.388 --> 00:18:18.765
You're probably horny
all the time. too!

365
00:18:18.765 --> 00:18:21.226
- Actually--
- It's okay. Candace!

366
00:18:21.226 --> 00:18:23.520
You can admit to flicking it
every now and again.

367
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.398
- No one's gonna crucify you.
- Dude. I don't know
what you're doing.

368
00:18:26.398 --> 00:18:28.984
- but please keep going.
- I'm horny.

369
00:18:28.984 --> 00:18:30.819
You are horny!

370
00:18:30.819 --> 00:18:33.697
Everyone in this room is horny!

371
00:18:33.697 --> 00:18:35.490
Like. what's the big deal?

372
00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:38.994
It takes a slight breeze.
and I am hard as a rock!

373
00:18:38.994 --> 00:18:40.245
All right. Sandagger.
lock it up.

374
00:18:40.245 --> 00:18:41.788
Come on. Dr. Capanna.

375
00:18:41.788 --> 00:18:43.999
This is Sex Ed.
for crying out loud.

376
00:18:43.999 --> 00:18:45.792
How can you just stand there

377
00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:48.504
and let this girl
make us all feel badly

378
00:18:48.504 --> 00:18:51.215
for having completely normal
sexual appetites?

379
00:18:51.215 --> 00:18:53.383
- How do you sleep at night?
- Yeah. I don't.

380
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:56.803
I have really bad apnea.

381
00:18:56.803 --> 00:18:59.723
- It's not because of this.
- Why?

382
00:18:59.723 --> 00:19:03.018
Why do we all have to pretend

383
00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:04.645
that we don't
want to fuck each other

384
00:19:04.645 --> 00:19:06.230
six ways to the weekend?

385
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:08.106
We should embrace it!

386
00:19:08.106 --> 00:19:09.650
For crying out loud.

387
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:11.777
I can see Dave Guggenheim's
boner from here.

388
00:19:11.777 --> 00:19:15.239
And you know what?
I love your boner. Dave.

389
00:19:15.239 --> 00:19:17.950
- Because Dave's boner
is in all of us.
- Yeah.

390
00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:21.828
- We are all Dave's boner!
- Yeah.

391
00:19:21.828 --> 00:19:25.457
And I'm not gonna sit here
and let you make everyone
in this room feel bad

392
00:19:25.457 --> 00:19:29.127
- for having completely normal
sexual appetites.
- Yeah!

393
00:19:29.127 --> 00:19:34.258
My name is Sidney Sandagger.

394
00:19:34.258 --> 00:19:37.511
and I once put a Sharpie
inside of my own butthole.

395
00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.811
- I humped a melon.
- Okay. Guggenheim!

396
00:19:45.811 --> 00:19:48.564
I cut a hole in it.
and I microwaved it.
and then I humped it.

397
00:19:48.564 --> 00:19:50.774
Hell yeah. man.
That is disgusting.

398
00:19:50.774 --> 00:19:53.694
Okay. don't encourage him.
That's a UTI waiting to happen.

399
00:19:53.694 --> 00:19:56.029
I get off to porn
of guys doing it
with other guys.

400
00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:59.157
- Sit down!
- I use my electric toothbrush
as a vibrator.

401
00:19:59.157 --> 00:20:00.909
My boyfriend and I
are into macrophilia.

402
00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:02.953
I have a reoccurring sex dream
about Elizabeth Warren.

403
00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:05.205
I have vertical balls!

404
00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:07.124
Oh.

405
00:20:07.124 --> 00:20:09.501
Like.
instead of a left one
and a right one.

406
00:20:09.501 --> 00:20:11.795
I have an upstairs
and a downstairs.

407
00:20:11.795 --> 00:20:13.547
It's like two-thirds
a snowman.

408
00:20:13.547 --> 00:20:16.175
It goes pickle. potato.
potato. cinnamon doughnut.

409
00:20:16.175 --> 00:20:19.052
That is so hot.

410
00:20:19.052 --> 00:20:20.888
Okay. all right. all right.

411
00:20:20.888 --> 00:20:24.016
Warner. Sandagger.
Guggenheim. okay.
Oh. God damn it.

412
00:20:24.016 --> 00:20:25.893
- No one's taking home condoms.
- Sid. Sid.

413
00:20:28.353 --> 00:20:31.106
Sid. dude!
Dude. what the hell was that?

414
00:20:31.106 --> 00:20:34.318
- I don't know.
- Dude. that was brilliant!

415
00:20:34.318 --> 00:20:36.737
- Come on! Say something!
- I don't know. man.

416
00:20:36.737 --> 00:20:38.488
Dude. that was
fucking incredible!

417
00:20:38.488 --> 00:20:40.741
Like. fuck every
other revolutionary
that's come before you.

418
00:20:40.741 --> 00:20:43.535
Like. you are the Messiah.
You are Jesus returning.

419
00:20:43.535 --> 00:20:44.912
Candace should've
fucking recognized that.

420
00:20:44.912 --> 00:20:46.788
Like. you are
the king-fucking-penis.

421
00:20:46.788 --> 00:20:49.333
Your schlong definitely
grew three inches from that.

422
00:20:49.333 --> 00:20:51.335
Whatever it is that
made it click for you.

423
00:20:51.335 --> 00:20:53.462
- that's what we gotta
tell everyone about.
- What?

424
00:20:53.462 --> 00:20:55.756
Oh. my God. Sid. we're gonna
get so much pussy from this.

425
00:20:55.756 --> 00:20:58.175
I was so inspired.
I feel liberated!

426
00:20:58.175 --> 00:21:00.552
Like. this is how...

427
00:21:03.764 --> 00:21:06.350
- Sid: Who is this?
- Jim: Hugh Hefner would be
so proud of you.

428
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:07.935
may his soul rest
in fucking peace.

429
00:21:07.935 --> 00:21:09.770
Like. he would be so happy.

430
00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:12.564
I'm going home
and I'm trying that...

431
00:21:16.985 --> 00:21:20.447
- ...like vagina juice.
- Sid: What's next?

432
00:21:20.447 --> 00:21:22.574
- That's fucking brilliant!
- How the hell should I know?

433
00:21:22.574 --> 00:21:23.659
It's so DIY. and. like...

434
00:21:26.203 --> 00:21:28.997
I've never really
thought about it before.

435
00:21:28.997 --> 00:21:30.582
I mean. I don't think
I want to deliver pizzas

436
00:21:30.582 --> 00:21:32.584
with Jim
for the rest of my life.

437
00:21:32.584 --> 00:21:34.962
but I'm a senior
in high school.

438
00:21:34.962 --> 00:21:36.922
I don't even know
what I wanna wear tomorrow.

439
00:21:38.382 --> 00:21:41.718
What if I die. Jim?
What if I die?

440
00:21:41.718 --> 00:21:45.597
What are you talk--
Chuck isn't gonna kill you.

441
00:21:45.597 --> 00:21:49.601
Dude. he beat a kid
nearly to death.

442
00:21:49.601 --> 00:21:51.186
and he's been beating
people ever since.

443
00:21:51.186 --> 00:21:53.146
It's not like he's
getting any worse at it.

444
00:21:54.189 --> 00:21:56.441
Oh. God. Two weeks.

445
00:21:58.402 --> 00:21:59.820
What if this is it?

446
00:22:01.613 --> 00:22:03.156
Oh. that is just so sad.

447
00:22:03.156 --> 00:22:05.617
Look. Chuck isn't
gonna kill you. dawg.

448
00:22:05.617 --> 00:22:09.204
- I'll protect you.
- Yeah. sure. you will.

449
00:22:09.204 --> 00:22:11.415
Unless he offers
to let you be in one
of his fucking videos.

450
00:22:11.415 --> 00:22:13.834
You think he'd ever
let me be in one?

451
00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:17.129
- Fuck you. man.
- I'm kidding.

452
00:22:17.129 --> 00:22:21.842
But. like. let's say
for a second that Chuck
might actually kill you.

453
00:22:21.842 --> 00:22:26.430
which I'll admit
is a possibility because
he does have a record.

454
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:28.849
So in this hypothetical world.

455
00:22:28.849 --> 00:22:30.934
then you got two weeks
left to live.

456
00:22:30.934 --> 00:22:32.895
What do you wanna do?

457
00:22:38.025 --> 00:22:38.984
That.

458
00:22:40.152 --> 00:22:42.404
Skip rocks?

459
00:22:42.404 --> 00:22:46.241
No. live.

460
00:22:46.241 --> 00:22:48.243
I wanna fucking live.

461
00:22:48.243 --> 00:22:50.204
What do you mean?

462
00:22:52.372 --> 00:22:54.791
Sidney. where has
that Sharpie been?

463
00:22:56.710 --> 00:23:01.048
Sid. what are you doing?

464
00:23:01.048 --> 00:23:03.091
"Win at some--"

465
00:23:03.091 --> 00:23:04.885
What does that even mean?

466
00:23:04.885 --> 00:23:08.472
I don't know.
I have no idea.

467
00:23:08.472 --> 00:23:11.266
But I'm not gonna.
like. you know.

468
00:23:11.266 --> 00:23:14.978
get a promotion
or start a company

469
00:23:14.978 --> 00:23:18.065
or have a fling
with some foreign girl
on a train in Europe.

470
00:23:18.065 --> 00:23:20.692
Everything that
you do in life.

471
00:23:20.692 --> 00:23:23.403
everything that makes life good.
I have to do it right now.

472
00:23:23.403 --> 00:23:28.116
I don't want just some memories.
I want all the memories.

473
00:23:30.494 --> 00:23:31.662
"Know real love."

474
00:23:34.289 --> 00:23:35.666
Are you gonna die a virgin?

475
00:23:42.214 --> 00:23:46.301
Yeah! That's my boy!
Let's go!

do you want?

502
00:25:15.015 --> 00:25:17.142
I don't remember saying
Beetlejuice three times.

503
00:25:17.142 --> 00:25:18.977
Ha. ha. ha.
You're so funny. Jim.

504
00:25:18.977 --> 00:25:20.938
We need to buy tickets
for Homecoming.

505
00:25:20.938 --> 00:25:22.814
and you have to pay
for them. so...

506
00:25:22.814 --> 00:25:25.025
Well. make sure you tell that
to the Japanese sex robot

507
00:25:25.025 --> 00:25:26.485
that you get to take you
to the dance.

508
00:25:26.485 --> 00:25:28.445
'cause I'm not going
with you. Luna.

509
00:25:28.445 --> 00:25:30.822
Dude. dude. dude. dude.
Incoming heatseekers inbound.

510
00:25:30.822 --> 00:25:31.865
- What?
- Hey.

511
00:25:33.784 --> 00:25:35.827
Holy shit.

512
00:25:35.827 --> 00:25:38.956
Oh. please. God.
let Tiff Mann be
my secret texter.

513
00:25:38.956 --> 00:25:40.832
Uh. hey. Hey.

514
00:25:40.832 --> 00:25:44.753
- I'm Tiff.
- Oh. I know.

515
00:25:44.753 --> 00:25:49.925
Um. listen. I just wanted
to say I'm really sorry
about what Chuck did to you.

516
00:25:49.925 --> 00:25:53.220
Oh. no. that's--

517
00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:55.055
that's. uh-- he's--

518
00:25:55.055 --> 00:25:57.307
- that's okay.
- No. it's not okay.

519
00:25:57.307 --> 00:25:59.643
His parents say that
he has impulsivity issues.

520
00:25:59.643 --> 00:26:03.063
but I think he can
just be a dick sometimes.

521
00:26:03.063 --> 00:26:05.858
Yeah. yeah.

522
00:26:05.858 --> 00:26:10.070
Also are you going to
go the game tonight?

523
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:12.823
He'll be there.
and so will I.

524
00:26:16.285 --> 00:26:18.704
Now is probably a good time
to talk about hockey.

525
00:26:18.704 --> 00:26:20.289
Let me see you get it in net.

526
00:26:20.289 --> 00:26:22.332
Hockey is a pretty
big deal in Eastland.

527
00:26:22.332 --> 00:26:24.418
- Let's get it in!
- Score a goal.

528
00:26:24.418 --> 00:26:27.546
and you get to feel
what it's like to be a god.

529
00:26:27.546 --> 00:26:30.090
Brad passes it to Worsham.
And he goes for the shot.

530
00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:35.762
He shoots. He scores!

531
00:26:35.762 --> 00:26:38.098
You know who knows that
feeling better than anyone?

532
00:26:38.098 --> 00:26:41.226
- Whoo!
- Eric Worsham.

533
00:26:41.226 --> 00:26:43.478
Eric. Eric. Eric!

534
00:26:43.478 --> 00:26:45.939
Eric is like a king
in Eastland.

535
00:26:45.939 --> 00:26:49.902
Face-off at center ice!

536
00:26:49.902 --> 00:26:52.196
Good move. man.
Good move. Eric. Come on!

537
00:26:52.196 --> 00:26:55.324
But heavy is the head
that wears the helmet.

538
00:26:55.324 --> 00:26:58.160
Eric has to be perfect.
because if he's not...

539
00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:00.954
Move your fucking feet!
Come on!

540
00:27:00.954 --> 00:27:04.917
...he gets to enjoy
a lifetime of pain
and humiliation.

541
00:27:04.917 --> 00:27:08.128
And they're alone!

542
00:27:08.128 --> 00:27:13.091
And just like that.
the Fighting Spirits have
sent this game into overtime.

543
00:27:13.091 --> 00:27:15.719
Get the fuck up.
you fucking piece of shit!

544
00:27:15.719 --> 00:27:18.263
Eric. that goal!
That's on you!

545
00:27:18.263 --> 00:27:20.349
And Coach Worsham expressing
his frustrations

546
00:27:20.349 --> 00:27:22.935
as they make their way
to the locker room.

547
00:27:22.935 --> 00:27:25.479
I wouldn't wanna be
at that dinner table tonight.

548
00:27:25.479 --> 00:27:26.939
Oh. yeah.
Did I forget to mention?

549
00:27:26.939 --> 00:27:29.816
That psycho coach?
Also Eric's dad.

550
00:27:29.816 --> 00:27:32.945
You know what you are?
I can't even say the word

551
00:27:32.945 --> 00:27:35.405
because the school board
won't let me call you
"pussies" anymore.

552
00:27:35.405 --> 00:27:37.658
You pissed away the last period.

553
00:27:37.658 --> 00:27:39.660
God damn. look at me when
I'm fucking talking to you!

554
00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:41.954
Beat the fuck out of someone
out there. okay?

555
00:27:41.954 --> 00:27:44.164
Like we're back
in fucking 'Nam!

556
00:27:44.164 --> 00:27:46.208
What have I got.
a bunch of pacifists?

557
00:27:46.208 --> 00:27:48.877
Or do I have me some warriors
in this fucking room?

558
00:27:48.877 --> 00:27:52.172
Now. I love you boys.
You know I do.

559
00:27:52.172 --> 00:27:54.883
On three. One. two. three!

560
00:27:54.883 --> 00:27:57.177
- Go. Frogs!
- Whoo! Go. Frogs!

561
00:27:57.177 --> 00:27:59.346
Come on. guys.
Let's go. come on.

562
00:27:59.346 --> 00:28:02.724
Come on. boys. let's go.
Get out there and fucking win.

563
00:28:02.724 --> 00:28:05.185
Come on!
I love you guys.

564
00:28:05.185 --> 00:28:08.522
Get out there. play hard.
play fast.

565
00:28:08.522 --> 00:28:10.315
Come on. guys.
Let's go. come on.

566
00:28:25.581 --> 00:28:26.832
You don't have go out there.

567
00:28:28.792 --> 00:28:30.961
What the hell
are you talking about. man?

568
00:28:30.961 --> 00:28:32.421
Say you go out there. right?

569
00:28:32.421 --> 00:28:34.089
And you do whatever
the hell it was

570
00:28:34.089 --> 00:28:36.550
your dad was screaming about.
and you win the game.

571
00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:38.385
and you win
a lot more games. right?

572
00:28:38.385 --> 00:28:41.054
You get a scholarship.
and now you're playing NCAA.

573
00:28:41.054 --> 00:28:42.764
And you do really well there.

574
00:28:42.764 --> 00:28:45.058
And now you're playing
in the NHL.

575
00:28:45.058 --> 00:28:48.228
And now you have fans
and money and women

576
00:28:48.228 --> 00:28:49.771
and you might even win
the Franklin Cup.

577
00:28:49.771 --> 00:28:51.565
- Stanley.
- The Stanley Cup.

578
00:28:53.609 --> 00:28:56.153
But you'll still be miserable.

579
00:28:56.153 --> 00:29:00.240
because you're not
playing to win.

580
00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.409
You're playing not to lose.

581
00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:06.246
- I don't know.
- I know what it's like

582
00:29:06.246 --> 00:29:07.247
to live your life
the way you do

583
00:29:07.247 --> 00:29:09.374
because you're afraid.

584
00:29:09.374 --> 00:29:12.252
I used to hide
in all kinds of places.

585
00:29:12.252 --> 00:29:16.381
- You hide in here.
- I gotta get back out there.

586
00:29:20.052 --> 00:29:21.220
No. you don't.

587
00:29:23.555 --> 00:29:26.058
Crowd: Let's go. Frogs!
Let's go. Frogs!

588
00:29:26.058 --> 00:29:29.436
Sid: Turns out jockstraps
are super uncomfortable.

589
00:29:29.436 --> 00:29:31.855
especially when you're using
somebody else's.

590
00:29:31.855 --> 00:29:35.567
And we got Eric Worsham
returning to the ice.

591
00:29:35.567 --> 00:29:37.653
Looks like he took
a few extra minutes of rest.

592
00:29:37.653 --> 00:29:39.530
and he'll need it against
these Fighting Spirits.

593
00:29:40.572 --> 00:29:42.407
And face-off at center ice.

594
00:29:42.407 --> 00:29:44.201
The drop!

595
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:49.998
Eric Worsham going offsides.

596
00:29:49.998 --> 00:29:52.501
Ooh. you don't see that
from Worsham every day.

597
00:29:52.501 --> 00:29:55.671
- Uh. we've got a face-off
deep in the Frog territory.
- I'm good. bro.

598
00:29:55.671 --> 00:29:58.507
Jim: There's the drop!
Worsham has got the puck.

599
00:29:58.507 --> 00:30:01.593
Oh! Worsham is pounded by
the Spirits. and he's down.

600
00:30:01.593 --> 00:30:02.970
Coach:
Get your fucking heads
in the game. kids.

601
00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:04.096
Jim: Looks like
that'll leave a mark.

602
00:30:04.096 --> 00:30:05.472
Coach:
Come on. let's go. boys.

603
00:30:05.472 --> 00:30:08.225
Let's go! God damn it.

604
00:30:08.225 --> 00:30:09.852
What the fuck are you doing?

605
00:30:09.852 --> 00:30:12.479
You cock-sucking
son of a fucking bitch.

606
00:30:15.107 --> 00:30:18.485
Sid: And then I remembered
why I was here.

607
00:30:18.485 --> 00:30:21.113
For in the realm of the dead.
where I'm going.

608
00:30:21.113 --> 00:30:23.240
I wanna be able
to talk about this shit.

609
00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.992
The Frogs lining up
with the Fighting Spirits

610
00:30:24.992 --> 00:30:28.203
- in striking distance.
- Let's go. E.

611
00:30:28.203 --> 00:30:30.914
Referee: All right. boys.
sticks down. face-off.

612
00:30:30.914 --> 00:30:34.793
Jim: And the puck is down.

613
00:30:34.793 --> 00:30:38.714
Oh! With a huge collision
on center ice.

614
00:30:38.714 --> 00:30:40.007
Worsham now has the puck.

615
00:30:43.093 --> 00:30:44.928
Fuck fear.

616
00:30:44.928 --> 00:30:46.889
I've been doing a lot
of avoiding in my life.

617
00:30:46.889 --> 00:30:48.891
Time to put it to good use.

618
00:30:48.891 --> 00:30:51.894
- Jim: Oh. he dodges!
- Come on!

619
00:30:51.894 --> 00:30:53.812
Jim: He's getting close
to the goal!

620
00:31:00.402 --> 00:31:02.946
With a spin like a ballerina!

621
00:31:04.239 --> 00:31:05.741
He shoots!

622
00:31:05.741 --> 00:31:07.743
No fear. motherfucker!

623
00:31:07.743 --> 00:31:08.994
He scores!

624
00:31:10.454 --> 00:31:14.124
Eric Worsham brings
the Frogs to victory!

625
00:31:14.124 --> 00:31:17.544
Crowd:
Eric. Eric. Eric!

626
00:31:17.544 --> 00:31:21.965
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

627
00:31:27.304 --> 00:31:31.141
- Sid.
- What the fuck?

628
00:31:31.141 --> 00:31:35.771
Sid? Is that the guy that shoved
the sharpie up his asshole?

629
00:31:35.771 --> 00:31:38.857
Um. correction.
that goal was scored by.

630
00:31:38.857 --> 00:31:40.859
and I can't believe
I'm saying this.

631
00:31:40.859 --> 00:31:45.405
my best friend Sid Sandagger!

632
00:31:52.079 --> 00:31:56.083
He's 160 pounds
of pure sexual energy.

633
00:31:56.083 --> 00:31:57.835
and he's very. very single!

634
00:31:57.835 --> 00:31:59.419
Go. Sid!

635
00:32:03.674 --> 00:32:07.553
Hey. Who the fuck are you?

636
00:32:07.553 --> 00:32:10.806
I'm a friend of your son's.
I guess?

637
00:32:10.806 --> 00:32:13.267
I clean the jockstraps.
I give them--
I'm. like. their penis--

638
00:32:13.267 --> 00:32:15.227
Where the fuck
did you learn that thing?

639
00:32:15.227 --> 00:32:18.438
I. um-- I...

640
00:32:18.438 --> 00:32:22.192
Fantastic Figure Skating
for Fabulous Five-Year-Olds.

641
00:32:24.027 --> 00:32:25.070
Can you be
at practice tomorrow?

642
00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:28.740
Yeah.

643
00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.410
Yes. sir. Yes. coach.

644
00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:45.192
Jim: I don't know
what you did to Eric.

645
00:33:45.192 --> 00:33:48.695
but that was some
serious Jedi voodoo shit.

646
00:33:48.695 --> 00:33:51.156
He was just afraid.
I used to live like that.

647
00:33:51.156 --> 00:33:54.576
- Dude. he quit hockey.
He joined the dance team.
- Good for him.

648
00:33:54.576 --> 00:33:56.870
- Yo. what up. Sid?
- What's up. Sandagger?

649
00:34:00.707 --> 00:34:01.834
Who are you?

650
00:34:03.669 --> 00:34:04.711
Moving on.

651
00:34:04.711 --> 00:34:06.129
With Arlene in the hospital

652
00:34:06.129 --> 00:34:08.382
for her
Seasonal Affective Disorder.

653
00:34:08.382 --> 00:34:10.050
I will be assuming
the role of interim

654
00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:11.343
student body president.

655
00:34:11.343 --> 00:34:13.345
However.
according to school bylaws.

656
00:34:13.345 --> 00:34:14.930
we will hold a special election

657
00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:16.723
to determine
a permanent replacement

658
00:34:16.723 --> 00:34:18.851
for the remainder
of the year.

659
00:34:18.851 --> 00:34:21.019
Obviously. I will need
a vice-president to run with.

660
00:34:21.019 --> 00:34:24.565
You'll be working with me.
designing campaign signs.

661
00:34:24.565 --> 00:34:28.735
ironing out our platform.
and of course. debating
alongside me in three days.

662
00:34:28.735 --> 00:34:33.699
Expect long. gruesome hours
and a whole lot of fun.

663
00:34:33.699 --> 00:34:35.742
Now. raise your hand

664
00:34:35.742 --> 00:34:36.910
if you'd like
to be considered.

665
00:34:40.747 --> 00:34:42.958
Sid: You know. I'm not sure
when it became cool

666
00:34:42.958 --> 00:34:46.795
to hate on Megan Waters.
or even why. really.

667
00:34:46.795 --> 00:34:48.755
But a few months ago.
some kid started
a FarmersOnly account

668
00:34:48.755 --> 00:34:51.175
and posted pictures of her
with a bunch of dicks

669
00:34:51.175 --> 00:34:52.676
and other stuff
flying around.

670
00:34:52.676 --> 00:34:54.928
People can be such jerks.

671
00:34:54.928 --> 00:34:57.389
And when do they decide
that's the one
we're gonna torture?

672
00:34:57.389 --> 00:35:00.601
That's the one
that we're gonna make
feel like shit?

673
00:35:00.601 --> 00:35:02.519
It isn't right.

674
00:35:05.606 --> 00:35:07.399
Great.

675
00:35:07.399 --> 00:35:08.984
I'll give you guys
some time to think it over

676
00:35:08.984 --> 00:35:10.485
and I'll put a sign-up sheet
on the door.

677
00:35:10.485 --> 00:35:13.572
Meeting adjourned.

678
00:35:13.572 --> 00:35:16.325
Before I die. I said
I'd fuck up the system.

679
00:35:16.325 --> 00:35:18.994
Helping Megan Waters
just might be the way.

680
00:35:18.994 --> 00:35:21.330
- Hey. Megan.
- Hey. Sid.

681
00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:23.165
About the whole
vice-president thing?

682
00:35:23.165 --> 00:35:24.791
I'm sure that
I'll find somebody.

683
00:35:24.791 --> 00:35:27.961
I would--
I would love to run with you.

684
00:35:29.588 --> 00:35:32.424
- Really?
- Yeah. Why not?

685
00:35:32.424 --> 00:35:35.219
Well. I should probably vet you
against the other candidates

686
00:35:35.219 --> 00:35:36.762
before I make
any final decisions.

687
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:42.768
Right. Welcome to the ticket.

688
00:35:44.811 --> 00:35:47.022
I've never really done drugs.

689
00:35:47.022 --> 00:35:49.107
Oh. except in sixth grade
when I took two Tylenol

690
00:35:49.107 --> 00:35:50.817
and drank
three Diet Dr Peppers

691
00:35:50.817 --> 00:35:53.237
and ended up riding
the mammoth at the museum.

692
00:35:53.237 --> 00:35:55.447
Haven't really
experimented since.

693
00:35:55.447 --> 00:35:58.450
This is the shit you want.
You ever spent
the night with molly?

694
00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:01.036
Uh. spent what?

695
00:36:01.036 --> 00:36:02.329
Oh. yeah. No.

696
00:36:02.329 --> 00:36:04.623
Um. what is molly exactly?

697
00:36:04.623 --> 00:36:06.667
You ever been rolling
down a hill in the ice

698
00:36:06.667 --> 00:36:08.794
but felt really hot
in your soul?

699
00:36:08.794 --> 00:36:13.298
Um. no.

700
00:36:13.298 --> 00:36:15.467
It's. like. spiritual.

701
00:36:15.467 --> 00:36:17.678
The real you comes out.

702
00:36:17.678 --> 00:36:18.762
You're gonna trip balls.

703
00:36:18.762 --> 00:36:21.265
Cool. Sweet.

704
00:36:21.265 --> 00:36:22.850
Um. how much do I owe you?

705
00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:27.479
- How much you want?
- Just a few... bits.

706
00:36:27.479 --> 00:36:30.065
- Bits?
- Pieces? I don't know.

707
00:36:30.065 --> 00:36:32.484
Just a handful.
I don't-- what--

708
00:36:32.484 --> 00:36:34.069
Just enough
to have a good time.

709
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:36.947
- 80.
- 80. Cool.

710
00:36:36.947 --> 00:36:39.867
Usually. I'd be
saving this money for.
I don't know. my future?

711
00:36:39.867 --> 00:36:41.493
That's the nice thing
about imminent death.

712
00:36:41.493 --> 00:36:43.495
It makes financial planning
a lot easier.

713
00:36:43.495 --> 00:36:46.790
But don't take more
than half a pill at a time.

714
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:47.791
- Half a pill?
- Yeah.

715
00:36:47.791 --> 00:36:49.835
Got it. Okay.

716
00:36:49.835 --> 00:36:54.298
- Minty fresh.
Just like this shit.
- Thank you.

717
00:36:54.298 --> 00:36:56.300
You think that Candace chick
would be down to hump?

718
00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:59.720
The abstinence cop? No.

719
00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:01.346
No. man.
I don't think she is.

720
00:37:03.307 --> 00:37:05.184
I might be catching
feelings for her.

721
00:37:05.184 --> 00:37:06.476
That's too bad. man.

722
00:37:12.065 --> 00:37:15.652
You know what. Dave?
Why wait?

723
00:37:15.652 --> 00:37:18.113
If not now. then when. right?

724
00:37:18.113 --> 00:37:20.949
- Boner bros.
- Boner bros.

725
00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:25.162
Like. a lot of puss.

726
00:37:25.162 --> 00:37:27.748
Oh. dude.
the Frakas twins are having
a party this weekend.

727
00:37:27.748 --> 00:37:30.167
- We gotta go.
- Sweet. What kind of party?

728
00:37:30.167 --> 00:37:32.794
Aw. dude.
it's a wine-tasting party.

729
00:37:32.794 --> 00:37:36.590
They got Austrian whites.
they got a sommelier coming.

730
00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:39.885
I mean. he's gonna-- I mean--
what do you think kind of party?

731
00:37:39.885 --> 00:37:41.345
Yeah. dude.
Whatever. I'm in.

732
00:37:41.345 --> 00:37:42.930
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

733
00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:46.058
Fuck yes. dude!
That's what I'm talking about.

734
00:37:46.058 --> 00:37:47.476
Dude. I thought I was
gonna have to sell that.

735
00:37:47.476 --> 00:37:49.561
Like. for real.
I had this whole thing prepared

736
00:37:49.561 --> 00:37:52.564
about how if we both hook up.
we would be brothers.

737
00:37:52.564 --> 00:37:53.774
Like. not that
we're not already brothers.

738
00:37:53.774 --> 00:37:55.776
but we would be like
boner brothers.

739
00:37:55.776 --> 00:37:59.071
Oh. dude. I'm so sorry.
but Dave Guggenheim
already called that.

740
00:38:14.294 --> 00:38:16.964
You know. I always suspected
Tiff Mann was an angel.

741
00:38:16.964 --> 00:38:18.966
but am I really
falling in love

742
00:38:18.966 --> 00:38:22.386
with an honest to goodness
celestial being?

743
00:38:22.386 --> 00:38:24.930
- Oh. shit.
- Oh. were you
masturbating again?

744
00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:26.974
- What? No!
- That's okay.

745
00:38:26.974 --> 00:38:28.392
Masturbation promotes health.

746
00:38:28.392 --> 00:38:30.060
That's why grandma's
never had the flu.

747
00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:32.104
- Can I help you guys?
- Well. when you are a parent.

748
00:38:32.104 --> 00:38:36.358
and your son's Sex Ed teacher
Dr. Capanna calls you

749
00:38:36.358 --> 00:38:38.652
and tells you that your son
has flipped out in class...

750
00:38:38.652 --> 00:38:41.738
Dr. Capanna. by the way.
sounds like the biggest moron.

751
00:38:41.738 --> 00:38:45.617
But also. if your son.
say. mysteriously ends up

752
00:38:45.617 --> 00:38:48.787
on the cable access
sports channel pucking a goal.

753
00:38:48.787 --> 00:38:51.832
we have no choice
but to get very invasive

754
00:38:51.832 --> 00:38:54.251
and ask what exactly
is going on?

755
00:38:54.251 --> 00:38:56.170
- I'm fine.
- Do you know what?

756
00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:57.504
- You don't look fine.
- Mm-mm.

757
00:38:57.504 --> 00:39:00.591
I had teeny little
mishap at school.

758
00:39:00.591 --> 00:39:01.884
- With a girl?
- No.

759
00:39:01.884 --> 00:39:03.886
- With Dr. Capanna?
- No.

760
00:39:06.471 --> 00:39:10.392
Okay. well.
if you change your mind.
you know where to find us.

761
00:39:18.233 --> 00:39:20.152
- Friday.
- Hmm?

762
00:39:20.152 --> 00:39:23.197
I have another game on Friday.

763
00:39:23.197 --> 00:39:26.950
And I am going to
Homecoming next week.

764
00:39:28.744 --> 00:39:31.121
Do you want us
to ask a girl out for you?

765
00:39:31.121 --> 00:39:33.081
Because we are good at that.

766
00:39:33.081 --> 00:39:35.918
No thank you. no.

767
00:39:47.888 --> 00:39:50.098
Well. all right.

768
00:39:50.098 --> 00:39:51.892
It appears as though
I am not the only one

769
00:39:51.892 --> 00:39:53.310
who is fucking up
the system nowadays.

770
00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:56.897
Whoo!

771
00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:00.067
Hey. take five. guys.
What's up?

772
00:40:00.067 --> 00:40:01.610
- What's up. man?
- How you doing?

773
00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:02.819
I'd heard you joined
the dance team.

774
00:40:02.819 --> 00:40:04.613
That's-- that was--
that was awesome.

775
00:40:04.613 --> 00:40:07.157
- Hey. nice goal
the other night.
- Thanks. man.

776
00:40:07.157 --> 00:40:08.742
Hey. I wanted to
tell you something.

777
00:40:08.742 --> 00:40:13.914
Um. just thank you
for talking to me
the other night.

778
00:40:13.914 --> 00:40:15.707
I feel like
I'm finally having fun
in high school.

779
00:40:15.707 --> 00:40:17.709
- I'm happy for you. man.
- I should get back there.

780
00:40:17.709 --> 00:40:21.171
- but have a good game Friday.
- Careful on those backflips.

781
00:40:21.171 --> 00:40:23.966
- Hey. don't let my dad
ride you too hard.
- I won't!

782
00:40:23.966 --> 00:40:28.470
- See you around. Sid.
Let's go again.
- All right! Okay. one...

783
00:40:33.934 --> 00:40:35.519
Good God. understudy.

784
00:40:35.519 --> 00:40:37.145
I cannot wait
to kiss that mouth.

785
00:40:37.145 --> 00:40:40.482
It's. like. the hottest
face hole I've ever seen.

786
00:40:40.482 --> 00:40:41.525
God.

787
00:40:41.525 --> 00:40:42.985
Only a total tool

788
00:40:42.985 --> 00:40:44.027
would call Tiff Mann's

789
00:40:44.027 --> 00:40:45.988
perfect lips a face hole.

790
00:40:45.988 --> 00:40:49.157
Then again. Erwin Mueller
is a total tool.

791
00:40:49.157 --> 00:40:52.077
Voice on PA:
This time with lights. please.
Thank you.

792
00:40:52.077 --> 00:40:57.457
♪ Me. alive ♪

793
00:40:57.457 --> 00:41:02.087
♪ You make me alive ♪

794
00:41:04.798 --> 00:41:10.429
♪ A final kiss
before I burn your body ♪

795
00:41:10.429 --> 00:41:14.308
Also. what the fuck
even is this show?

796
00:41:14.308 --> 00:41:16.351
Megan: 'Cause we know that
Olivia's gonna go after

797
00:41:16.351 --> 00:41:18.770
those one-issue
plastic straw voters.

798
00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:20.647
who aren't even informed.
and they don't even know

799
00:41:20.647 --> 00:41:22.357
that it's landfills
that are causing

800
00:41:22.357 --> 00:41:25.152
the most pollution
in our entire planet.

801
00:41:25.152 --> 00:41:26.778
But we have to appeal to them.

802
00:41:26.778 --> 00:41:28.947
We have to appeal
to that dumb demographic.

803
00:41:28.947 --> 00:41:31.366
Hey!
You know. that's really rude.

804
00:41:31.366 --> 00:41:33.452
to just rifle through
people's things?

805
00:41:33.452 --> 00:41:36.371
What is it? Is it. like.
a diary or a journal?

806
00:41:36.371 --> 00:41:38.790
Is it a hit list?
Are you an assassin?

807
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:43.921
It sounds stupid.
but I write poetry sometimes.

808
00:41:43.921 --> 00:41:46.340
- Can I hear one?
- No.

809
00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:48.050
- Please?
- No.

810
00:41:57.267 --> 00:41:59.770
Look. it's...

811
00:42:01.396 --> 00:42:02.523
I'm still fixing them.

812
00:42:09.947 --> 00:42:12.658
Rainbows contain
all of the colors.

813
00:42:12.658 --> 00:42:16.411
but white light contains all
of the colors of the rainbow.

814
00:42:16.411 --> 00:42:20.082
I am the white light
on a cold night.

815
00:42:20.082 --> 00:42:21.667
And if you look just right.

816
00:42:21.667 --> 00:42:26.171
you will see all
of the colors inside of me.

817
00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:30.843
There.
Now we can get back
to recycling.

818
00:42:30.843 --> 00:42:33.428
- That was great.
- You don't have to like it.

819
00:42:33.428 --> 00:42:37.432
- I know.
- You know. I've never actually

820
00:42:37.432 --> 00:42:39.768
read one of my poems out loud.

821
00:42:39.768 --> 00:42:45.232
Normally when
I try to talk to people.
they just walk away.

822
00:42:45.232 --> 00:42:49.486
Megan. I'm sorry
that I never stuck up for you
in student council.

823
00:42:49.486 --> 00:42:51.196
- It's fine.
- It's not.

824
00:42:51.196 --> 00:42:53.448
It's not. I'm sorry.

825
00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:58.662
Okay. we really need
a stronger stance on cardboard.

826
00:42:58.662 --> 00:43:02.124
Let's just take a break.

827
00:43:03.417 --> 00:43:05.419
I can't just take a break. Sid.

828
00:43:05.419 --> 00:43:07.671
Every minute that we take off

829
00:43:07.671 --> 00:43:09.882
is another one that
Olivia Binghman doesn't.

830
00:43:09.882 --> 00:43:12.676
That dirty whore
has been trying to steal
the council from me for years.

831
00:43:12.676 --> 00:43:16.138
and we are not
about to let that happen.

832
00:43:16.138 --> 00:43:17.222
Mm-hmm.

833
00:43:18.682 --> 00:43:20.392
- Your breath stinks.
- I'm good.

834
00:43:20.392 --> 00:43:23.437
- I have some in my bag.
- Good. 'cause I'm almost out.

835
00:43:26.857 --> 00:43:30.944
I've been meaning to get
the average joe perspective.

836
00:43:30.944 --> 00:43:33.572
What do you feel?
Paper or plastic?

837
00:43:36.867 --> 00:43:40.704
Yeah. my mom threw a hairdryer
at my dad last night.

838
00:43:40.704 --> 00:43:44.583
- I don't know if he bled.
but it look like it hurt.
- Oh. my God.

839
00:43:44.583 --> 00:43:49.671
- Um...
- I wanna believe in love.
but I don't know anymore.

840
00:43:51.965 --> 00:43:56.303
Yeah. that's one of life's
greatest mysteries.

841
00:43:56.303 --> 00:43:58.305
It's big. right?
Like. life-changing.

842
00:43:58.305 --> 00:44:00.933
Mm-hmm. and it's--
just don't feel like
it's your fault.

843
00:44:00.933 --> 00:44:02.893
- I'm sure it's not your fault.
- It might be.

844
00:44:11.944 --> 00:44:13.153
Sorry. I need a minute.

845
00:44:13.153 --> 00:44:16.281
Yeah. take-- I'm sorry. Yeah.

846
00:44:18.951 --> 00:44:20.994
- I didn't mean
to make that weird.
- No. no.

847
00:44:20.994 --> 00:44:22.621
- I'm good. I'm surviving.
- Yeah. of course.

848
00:44:22.621 --> 00:44:24.957
I just-- I wanna be there
and I don't know with to say

849
00:44:24.957 --> 00:44:29.545
because I don't-- I never--
my parents are still in love.

850
00:44:29.545 --> 00:44:32.631
- So. sorry. I just--
- Yeah. thanks for
rubbing that in.

851
00:44:32.631 --> 00:44:37.344
- Um. I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

852
00:44:38.762 --> 00:44:39.847
Announcer:
Attention. Eastland Frogs.

853
00:44:39.847 --> 00:44:41.348
The student council assembly

854
00:44:41.348 --> 00:44:43.642
will begin in ten minutes
in the auditorium.

855
00:44:43.642 --> 00:44:45.352
Where the fuck
have you been. Sandagger?

856
00:44:45.352 --> 00:44:46.979
Megan. this is the men's room.

857
00:44:46.979 --> 00:44:48.772
I know.
What the hell are you
doing in here. huh?

858
00:44:48.772 --> 00:44:52.609
- I'm just peeing.
- You peed?

859
00:44:52.609 --> 00:44:56.905
Every great politician knows.
"No pee before debate.

860
00:44:56.905 --> 00:44:59.783
It's the pee
that makes you great."

861
00:44:59.783 --> 00:45:02.244
I haven't pissed in four days.

862
00:45:02.244 --> 00:45:04.162
Oh. my God.
That's incredibly unhealthy.

863
00:45:04.162 --> 00:45:06.540
By the way. your mints.
they taste like shit.

864
00:45:10.377 --> 00:45:14.256
- No. Oh. shit.
- What?

865
00:45:14.256 --> 00:45:16.341
Are they not mints?

866
00:45:18.010 --> 00:45:20.387
- Uh. kind of.
- Kind of?

867
00:45:20.387 --> 00:45:23.223
Okay. there's no such thing as
kind of when it comes to mints.

868
00:45:23.223 --> 00:45:26.101
They either refresh
your breath or they don't.

869
00:45:26.101 --> 00:45:27.686
They freshen your perspective.

870
00:45:29.229 --> 00:45:30.439
Oh. my God. they're a drug.

871
00:45:30.439 --> 00:45:33.275
I've never taken a drug before!

872
00:45:36.528 --> 00:45:39.448
Get the fuck out of here. Eli!

873
00:45:39.448 --> 00:45:42.367
- Move!
- And vote Megan Waters!

874
00:45:42.367 --> 00:45:45.746
Nobody's gonna vote
Megan Waters now.

875
00:45:45.746 --> 00:45:47.748
Relax. It's okay.

876
00:45:47.748 --> 00:45:49.833
- I think I need to call
my pediatrician.
- It's gonna be fine.

877
00:45:49.833 --> 00:45:53.045
I'm-- you're gonna be fine.
I promise.

878
00:45:53.045 --> 00:45:54.713
You're gonna go out there.

879
00:45:54.713 --> 00:45:56.048
and you're gonna be yourself.

880
00:45:56.048 --> 00:45:57.299
and everyone's gonna love you.

881
00:45:57.299 --> 00:45:59.635
- No one loves me. Sid!
- Jesus.

882
00:45:59.635 --> 00:46:01.386
No one even likes me.

883
00:46:01.386 --> 00:46:05.265
Because people like you and me.
we're not pretty.

884
00:46:05.265 --> 00:46:07.392
No! But we're smart.

885
00:46:07.392 --> 00:46:10.771
And that means that
we're supposed to have
good lives after we leave.

886
00:46:10.771 --> 00:46:15.692
No. Megan.
we're gonna start now.

887
00:46:16.777 --> 00:46:18.278
See?

888
00:46:20.072 --> 00:46:22.449
You're gonna be fine.
I promise.

889
00:46:23.825 --> 00:46:24.785
Okay.

890
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:29.164
So what drug was it
that we took?

891
00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:48.475
- Oh. okay.
- Your turn. your turn.

892
00:46:48.475 --> 00:46:50.310
Hey. everyone. Sid Sandagger.

893
00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:52.229
Uh. it is my strong opinion

894
00:46:52.229 --> 00:46:55.023
that Megan
is the fucking best.

895
00:46:55.023 --> 00:46:56.483
- I'm serious. girl.
you're such--
- Really?

896
00:46:56.483 --> 00:46:58.694
- Yeah. you're the fucking shit.
- Aw. dude.

897
00:46:58.694 --> 00:47:01.405
- I love you so fucking much.
- Such good friends.
We've blossomed.

898
00:47:01.405 --> 00:47:02.656
- Our friendship has blossomed.
- Aww. Sid.

899
00:47:02.656 --> 00:47:05.701
Oh. yeah. of course.
Friends.

900
00:47:05.701 --> 00:47:07.327
Okay. I hear ya.

901
00:47:07.327 --> 00:47:11.707
We have evaluated things
and come to the conclusion

902
00:47:11.707 --> 00:47:13.500
that you have all
been cocks to her.

903
00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:15.335
Yeah. you guys--
you guys have been cocks.

904
00:47:15.335 --> 00:47:16.712
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You've been cocks!

905
00:47:16.712 --> 00:47:18.797
Especially you.
Jonathan Gliggman.

906
00:47:18.797 --> 00:47:21.133
Yeah. but she is wonderful.

907
00:47:21.133 --> 00:47:23.135
wonderful.
if you can't tell already.

908
00:47:23.135 --> 00:47:24.261
- Thank you.
- And I think it's about time

909
00:47:24.261 --> 00:47:25.721
that you got to
know her yourself.

910
00:47:25.721 --> 00:47:29.349
So. um. well. without
much further ado. Megan.

911
00:47:29.349 --> 00:47:31.185
Be yourself.
You got this.

912
00:47:33.145 --> 00:47:34.313
Whoo!

I refract.

915
00:47:51.371 --> 00:47:54.208
But I glow for me.

946

00:52:58.929 --> 00:53:02.850
- Mom! Making me date
that brown fire hydrant--
- She is a lovely girl.

1003
00:53:02.850 --> 00:53:05.477
- She's like Satan in the flesh.
- I will smack your ass

1004
00:53:05.477 --> 00:53:07.604
- back to next Thursday. okay?
- Okay. okay. okay.

1005
00:53:07.604 --> 00:53:09.690
That's the kind of woman
you could slap around
in bed a little.

1006
00:53:09.690 --> 00:53:11.984
- Okay. Mom. please stop.
- I punched your father
in the face!

1007
00:53:11.984 --> 00:53:15.571
- Eww. eww! Mom!
- And then I got down on him
and just went to town!

1008
00:53:15.571 --> 00:53:17.197
- Mom!
- Si. and...

1009
00:53:34.548 --> 00:53:36.675
Okay. What the fuck.

1010
00:53:38.594 --> 00:53:42.639
Oh. that was too many knocks.
Too many knocks. Okay.

1011
00:53:42.639 --> 00:53:45.100
- You're not even
gonna say I look nice?
- You don't look nice.

1012
00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:46.935
You look like
an incredibly mean person

1013
00:53:46.935 --> 00:53:48.228
because you are one.

1014
00:53:48.228 --> 00:53:50.731
You have the mustache
of a child molester

1015
00:53:50.731 --> 00:53:52.816
and the haircut
of a molested child.

1016
00:53:55.903 --> 00:53:57.487
Relax. relax.

1017
00:54:10.292 --> 00:54:13.170
- Hey.
- Hey.

1018
00:54:13.170 --> 00:54:17.132
Is that your minivan?

1019
00:54:19.384 --> 00:54:23.222
It's Jim's.
Great for families.

1020
00:54:28.644 --> 00:54:30.479
Fuck my life.

1021
00:54:30.479 --> 00:54:32.439
You ever wonder
what life is like

1022
00:54:32.439 --> 00:54:34.066
for the cool kids?

1023
00:54:34.066 --> 00:54:37.027
Well. tonight I find out.

1024
00:54:41.156 --> 00:54:42.741
You okay?

1025
00:54:46.161 --> 00:54:48.580
Yeah. Yeah. I'm okay.

1026
00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:50.374
- Wanna get a drink?
- Oh. yeah.

1027
00:54:50.374 --> 00:54:51.792
- Totally.
- Let's do it.

1028
00:54:58.757 --> 00:55:00.717
Cheers.
Let's just go for it. Okay.

1029
00:55:00.717 --> 00:55:03.804
- Nice-- oh. you--
- Oh. my God.

1030
00:55:03.804 --> 00:55:06.515
- Is this one bad?
- Sid. come hit this!

1031
00:55:14.731 --> 00:55:18.110
Chug. chug. chug. chug. chug!

1032
00:55:18.110 --> 00:55:20.028
Chug. chug. chug. chug!

1033
00:55:28.537 --> 00:55:31.623
This is literally
the coolest fucking party

1034
00:55:31.623 --> 00:55:33.625
that I have ever been to
in my entire life.

1035
00:55:33.625 --> 00:55:37.212
Why doesn't anybody want
to go ride a horse with me?

1036
00:55:37.212 --> 00:55:39.214
You wanna do one?
Guys. let's go--

1037
00:55:39.214 --> 00:55:42.467
Dude. give them their moment.
Stop hopping on the...

1038
00:55:42.467 --> 00:55:44.219
For a moment...

1039
00:55:44.219 --> 00:55:47.097
...this party
felt like heaven.

1040
00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:53.520
Luna: Oh. like you haven't
thought about it.

1041
00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:57.399
Yo. Why aren't you
responding to my texts?

1042
00:55:57.399 --> 00:55:59.776
'Cause I don't want
to talk to you.

1043
00:55:59.776 --> 00:56:03.363
- Okay. let's go for a walk.
- No.

1044
00:56:03.363 --> 00:56:08.452
We're gonna go for a walk.
'cause we clearly have things--

1045
00:56:08.452 --> 00:56:11.747
What the fuck?

1046
00:56:11.747 --> 00:56:14.625
- Uh. uh. Chuck. Yo. dawg.
- I need you to shut up.

1047
00:56:14.625 --> 00:56:17.252
Sid: Who gets out of anger
management a week early?

1048
00:56:17.252 --> 00:56:20.672
- Fuck you. Switzerland.
- Dude. don't.

1049
00:56:20.672 --> 00:56:24.259
- Don't do this.
- David. Candace. I--

1050
00:56:24.259 --> 00:56:28.222
I really appreciate it.
but I'm fine.

1051
00:56:31.058 --> 00:56:34.269
Well. now I see
why you wanted
to get me suspended.

1052
00:56:34.269 --> 00:56:36.897
you little piece of shit.

1053
00:56:36.897 --> 00:56:39.358
Give me one good reason

1054
00:56:39.358 --> 00:56:41.193
why I shouldn't
kill you right now.

1055
00:56:41.193 --> 00:56:44.655
- Uh...
- This is it.

1056
00:56:44.655 --> 00:56:48.867
Barring divine intervention.
I am... dead?

1057
00:56:50.661 --> 00:56:52.287
Oh!

1058
00:56:55.415 --> 00:56:59.711
- Not again. Oh!
- It may not have been
a burning bush.

1059
00:56:59.711 --> 00:57:03.215
but if an exploding car
at the time of your
imminent demise

1060
00:57:03.215 --> 00:57:04.925
isn't evidence
of a higher power.

1061
00:57:04.925 --> 00:57:06.009
then I don't know what is.

1062
00:57:06.009 --> 00:57:08.220
Halle-fucking-lujah!

1063
00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:10.806
Let's get the hell out of here.

1064
00:57:10.806 --> 00:57:12.516
- Yeah.
- I think God just did that.

1065
00:57:12.516 --> 00:57:14.768
That was fucking dope!

1066
00:57:14.768 --> 00:57:17.855
Oh. my God.

1067
00:57:22.901 --> 00:57:24.820
- Oh. I'm shaking.
- It just--

1068
00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:27.322
That happened. right?
You saw that too?

1069
00:57:27.322 --> 00:57:30.200
I feel like we're in
a rap video or something.

1070
00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:32.494
- What happened?
- I don't know.

1071
00:57:39.626 --> 00:57:41.962
Oh. shit. I'm sorry.

1072
00:57:41.962 --> 00:57:44.131
That just came out.
I don't even know
what noise that was.

1073
00:57:44.131 --> 00:57:48.343
It sounded like
you put a pig in a blender.

1074
00:57:48.343 --> 00:57:51.346
Um. I'm so confused.

1075
00:57:51.346 --> 00:57:53.765
Have you not been texting me
this whole time?

1076
00:57:53.765 --> 00:57:55.309
No. I told you.
I don't have your number.

1077
00:57:55.309 --> 00:57:58.770
Look. the truth is. Sid.

1078
00:57:58.770 --> 00:58:01.690
I've been trying
really hard to like you.

1079
00:58:01.690 --> 00:58:04.234
I mean. like that.

1080
00:58:04.234 --> 00:58:07.571
That's cool. because
I want to like you. too.

1081
00:58:07.571 --> 00:58:11.658
And I do like you.
so I'm like a success story
you can really look up to.

1082
00:58:16.121 --> 00:58:20.834
You know. I've just--
I've felt so trapped dating
Chuck the past few years.

1083
00:58:20.834 --> 00:58:23.003
He and I. we have this cycle.

1084
00:58:23.003 --> 00:58:26.131
It's. like.
we fight. we break up.
we get back together.

1085
00:58:26.131 --> 00:58:28.175
He gets into some
kind of insane trouble

1086
00:58:28.175 --> 00:58:30.177
and I swear that
I'm gonna never date him again.

1087
00:58:30.177 --> 00:58:35.933
And then I just end up
back with him again.

1088
00:58:37.935 --> 00:58:42.272
I guess I just thought
that maybe if I liked you

1089
00:58:42.272 --> 00:58:45.817
then I wouldn't go back
to him. you know?

1090
00:58:45.817 --> 00:58:47.945
I wouldn't make
the same mistake.

1091
00:58:51.323 --> 00:58:53.825
But...

1092
00:58:53.825 --> 00:58:59.414
But I just-- I don't feel
that way about you. Sid.

1093
00:58:59.414 --> 00:59:00.999
I'm sorry.

1094
00:59:05.546 --> 00:59:06.505
Friends?

1095
00:59:24.439 --> 00:59:26.024
She didn't even
jerk you off?

1096
00:59:30.028 --> 00:59:30.988
Bummer.

1097
01:00:16.408 --> 01:00:18.785
Screw. Chuck.
He can't touch me.

1098
01:00:18.785 --> 01:00:20.204
- What's up. Sid?
- Yo.

1099
01:00:20.204 --> 01:00:21.830
When he left.
I was invisible.

1100
01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:24.499
Now I'm invincible.

1101
01:00:24.499 --> 01:00:27.503
I'm like a hero.
and people protect heroes.

1102
01:00:27.503 --> 01:00:31.632
Heroes never die. right?

1103
01:01:08.752 --> 01:01:10.546
Uh. hey.

1104
01:01:10.546 --> 01:01:13.131
Hey. can I talk to you guys?

1105
01:01:16.301 --> 01:01:17.970
I think-- I think that--

1106
01:01:17.970 --> 01:01:19.346
I think that you should log off.

1107
01:01:19.346 --> 01:01:20.931
Get the fuck outta here.

1108
01:01:20.931 --> 01:01:23.559
Okay. I get it. I do.

1109
01:01:23.559 --> 01:01:28.772
I love being in here.
but I think you're--

1110
01:01:28.772 --> 01:01:30.941
I just--
I think you're missing out.

1111
01:01:30.941 --> 01:01:32.693
Trust me. I'm you.

1112
01:01:32.693 --> 01:01:36.113
We're to living our lives
to our full potential.

1113
01:01:36.113 --> 01:01:40.325
Out there.
the quests don't wait for you
like they do in here.

1114
01:01:40.325 --> 01:01:43.579
There's a lot more out there
than orcs and night elves

1115
01:01:43.579 --> 01:01:47.374
and you shouldn't be spending
your whole lives hiding.

1116
01:01:51.503 --> 01:01:54.298
Yeah. all right. Okay.

01:06:07.426 --> 01:06:10.053
Gone to the other shore
of becoming.

1170
01:06:10.053 --> 01:06:11.847
mind released entirely.

1171
01:06:11.847 --> 01:06:15.058
you will never again
undergo birth and old age."

1172
01:06:15.058 --> 01:06:17.853
- Wow. That's beautiful.
- Isn't it?

1173
01:06:17.853 --> 01:06:18.979
- Depressing.
- No.

and my dad is a librarian.

1181
01:06:37.873 --> 01:06:40.375

01:06:59.102 --> 01:07:02.648
Like this. Joey.

1187
01:07:02.648 --> 01:07:03.899
All right.
if you don't poop there.

1188
01:07:03.899 --> 01:07:05.317
I'm just gonna tell Mom
that you pooped.

1189
01:07:05.317 --> 01:07:09.863
Oh. my God.

1190
01:07:09.863 --> 01:07:12.908
Jimbo. what's up. brother?

1191
01:07:12.908 --> 01:07:15.202
Hey. dawg.

1192
01:07:15.202 --> 01:07:18.038
You wanna come chill with us?
We're gonna shoot a session.

1193
01:07:18.038 --> 01:07:20.332
You need someone to. like.
hold the camera or something?

1194
01:07:20.332 --> 01:07:22.334
No. bro. we need to get you
in a goddamn video.

1195
01:07:22.334 --> 01:07:25.546
- You're hilarious.
- Uh. all right. Yeah.

1196
01:07:25.546 --> 01:07:26.755
Chuck: Jim. Jim!
Jim. Jim. Jim!

1197
01:07:26.755 --> 01:07:29.550
- All right.
- Fuck yeah. baby!

1198
01:07:29.550 --> 01:07:32.594
- This fucking kid.
- Your dog smells.

1199
01:07:44.356 --> 01:07:46.900
I hope you do die.
you fucking drug addict.

1200
01:07:52.739 --> 01:07:54.116
Hey. guys.

1201
01:08:01.123 --> 01:08:02.583
I could press charges.
you know?

1202
01:08:02.583 --> 01:08:04.168
For what you did to my face?

1203
01:08:04.168 --> 01:08:05.961
My mom had to put chapstick
on my eyelids.

1204
01:08:05.961 --> 01:08:08.881
Okay. what the fuck is going on?

1205
01:08:08.881 --> 01:08:10.382
I feel like
I'm in a fricking. like.

1206
01:08:10.382 --> 01:08:11.800
spaceship right now. right?

1207
01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:14.595
You are in a spaceship.

1208
01:08:14.595 --> 01:08:15.762
Yeah. I am!

1209
01:08:15.762 --> 01:08:17.472
I'm in a fucking
spaceship. dawg!

1210
01:08:17.472 --> 01:08:19.600
- And your boy. Sid?
- Yeah?

1211
01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:21.393
Dude. I've been hearing
so many stories.

1212
01:08:21.393 --> 01:08:23.187
Actually. I have
mad respect for the guy.

1213
01:08:23.187 --> 01:08:24.813
Dude. he's been going crazy.

1214
01:08:24.813 --> 01:08:27.774
He spiked that theater kid's
makeup with Icy Hot

1215
01:08:27.774 --> 01:08:29.276
just so he could go onstage.

1216
01:08:29.276 --> 01:08:31.653
And he got Megan Waters
crazy high for her debate.

1217
01:08:31.653 --> 01:08:33.280
- Megan fucking waters?
- Yeah. yeah.

1218
01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:35.032
Chuck: He's just trying
to live it up before I X him?

1219
01:08:35.032 --> 01:08:37.618
And. dude.
he's determined
to get laid. too.

1220
01:08:37.618 --> 01:08:39.203
He tried sticking it
to Tiff Mann.

1221
01:08:39.203 --> 01:08:41.663
- But don't worry.
She said no.
- Yeah?

1222
01:08:41.663 --> 01:08:43.207
Jim: Now he's trying
to hit on this gamer chick.

1223
01:08:43.207 --> 01:08:44.791
He even went to church with her

1224
01:08:44.791 --> 01:08:46.293
just so that
he could get in her pants

1225
01:08:46.293 --> 01:08:47.586
all before
you fucking kill him.

1226
01:08:47.586 --> 01:08:49.421
Sid. that is cold. brother.

1227
01:08:49.421 --> 01:08:51.215
You're not gonna. like.
hurt him or anything?

1228
01:08:51.215 --> 01:08:53.509
'Cause. like. I'm--
like. I'm down with him.

1229
01:08:53.509 --> 01:08:55.802
No. for sure.
I'm not gonna hurt him.

1230
01:08:55.802 --> 01:08:57.554
- Um...
- Dope.

1231
01:08:57.554 --> 01:09:00.474
Chuck: 'Cause I'm gonna
fucking end him.

1232
01:09:00.474 --> 01:09:03.644
I'm gonna beat him so badly

1233
01:09:03.644 --> 01:09:07.231
that he's never able to feel
a fucking thing ever again.

1234
01:09:07.231 --> 01:09:09.858
- Say. "Hi. Sid."
- Wait. what?

1235
01:09:17.407 --> 01:09:19.117
- Hey!
- Slow down!

1236
01:09:23.497 --> 01:09:24.957
Fuck off. noob.

1237
01:09:36.426 --> 01:09:38.846
What was everyone
so upset about?

1238
01:09:38.846 --> 01:09:41.682
Yeah. they were
part of a list. So what?

1239
01:09:41.682 --> 01:09:45.394
I still did all the things
they thought were great.

1240
01:09:45.394 --> 01:09:48.021
But after the video.
everything went to shit.

1241
01:09:49.857 --> 01:09:51.650
I was kicked off the ice.

1242
01:09:51.650 --> 01:09:53.652
and the rest of the guys
refused to play with me.

1243
01:09:56.154 --> 01:09:59.283
Megan was put on
disciplinary probation
for doing drugs.

1244
01:09:59.283 --> 01:10:01.785
and then kicked off
student council.

1245
01:10:01.785 --> 01:10:06.081
Candace re-pledged
her eternal abstinence
and dumped Dave.

1246
01:10:06.081 --> 01:10:08.125
Dr. Capanna:
Oh. yeah. sure...

1247
01:10:08.125 --> 01:10:10.919
Oh. and guess who decided
to be sick today?

1248
01:10:21.096 --> 01:10:23.098
- Hey. man.
- Dude. seriously? Go away.

1249
01:10:23.098 --> 01:10:24.641
- Sid. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Go. dude.

1250
01:10:24.641 --> 01:10:26.518
- I made a mistake.
- Don't fucking touch me.

1251
01:10:26.518 --> 01:10:28.312
- Leave. man.
- I made a mistake.
Just hear me out.

1252
01:10:28.312 --> 01:10:29.688
Just let me talk
for a little bit.

1253
01:10:29.688 --> 01:10:31.899
Do you have any idea
what the fuck you've done?

1254
01:10:31.899 --> 01:10:37.112
- Sid. I do know what I did.
- You have literally
ruined everything.

1255
01:10:37.112 --> 01:10:41.366
All you ever wanted was for
someone popular to like you.
and they never will.

1256
01:10:41.366 --> 01:10:42.534
Luna. was right. Jim.

1257
01:10:42.534 --> 01:10:45.329
You are an insecure
attention whore

1258
01:10:45.329 --> 01:10:46.747
who would literally sell out

1259
01:10:46.747 --> 01:10:49.082
the only real friend
that you have ever had

1260
01:10:49.082 --> 01:10:51.668
for the chance at someone
with more fucking followers.

1261
01:10:51.668 --> 01:10:54.880
Sid. Sid. I'm sorry. dude.

1262
01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:57.508
Sid. come on! Sid!

1263
01:11:01.011 --> 01:11:04.640
Jim is an idiot.

1264
01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:05.766
Stupid.

1265
01:11:09.937 --> 01:11:15.943
I wasn't just trying
to get with you.

1266
01:11:15.943 --> 01:11:17.444
I promise.

1267
01:11:21.281 --> 01:11:22.824
God.

1268
01:11:31.667 --> 01:11:32.751
I know.

1269
01:11:49.977 --> 01:11:52.479
Aah! God!

1270
01:12:06.493 --> 01:12:08.370
This is why I have rules.

1271
01:12:08.370 --> 01:12:09.621
This is why I said to shut up

1272
01:12:09.621 --> 01:12:11.039
and to stay under the radar

1273
01:12:11.039 --> 01:12:13.000
and to not mess
with the system.

1274
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.419
Because when you speak up.
when you care.

1275
01:12:15.419 --> 01:12:17.421
and when you stop
being afraid.

1276
01:12:17.421 --> 01:12:20.424
people will hurt you.

1277
01:12:20.424 --> 01:12:22.050
They will find
that thing inside of you

1278
01:12:22.050 --> 01:12:24.636
that you try so hard
to guard and protect.

1279
01:12:24.636 --> 01:12:26.638
and they will poke at it
and jab at it

1280
01:12:26.638 --> 01:12:30.809
until you want to just crawl
into a little ball and cry.

1281
01:12:30.809 --> 01:12:33.395
and then you might
as well be dead.

1282
01:12:50.245 --> 01:12:54.041
Why haven't you been
answering Jim's DMs?

1283
01:12:54.041 --> 01:12:56.502
I don't really feel like
talking to him right now.

1284
01:12:56.502 --> 01:12:58.879
What he did was stupid.

1285
01:12:58.879 --> 01:13:01.965
But what do you expect?
It's Jim.

1286
01:13:01.965 --> 01:13:05.052
He has
the emotional intelligence
of a premature baby

1287
01:13:05.052 --> 01:13:08.096
and the actual intelligence
of one of those baboons
with the red asses.

1288
01:13:08.096 --> 01:13:10.057
Those are just baboons.

1289
01:13:10.057 --> 01:13:12.184
And they use tools.
they're brilliant animals.

1290
01:13:12.184 --> 01:13:13.435
Well. Jim isn't.

1291
01:13:14.686 --> 01:13:16.230
But he's also your best friend.

1292
01:13:20.150 --> 01:13:21.610
You're coming to
Homecoming tonight. right?

1293
01:13:21.610 --> 01:13:25.572
No. I don't have a date.
I don't have a ride.

1294
01:13:25.572 --> 01:13:28.909
I got you a tie
and boutonnière
when Jim got his.

1295
01:13:28.909 --> 01:13:31.286
Fair warning.
he did that dumb thing

1296
01:13:31.286 --> 01:13:33.705
where he got the pimp cane
and the top hat.

1297
01:13:33.705 --> 01:13:34.831
Ugh.

1298
01:13:34.831 --> 01:13:37.918
As far as a date goes.
fuck it.

1299
01:13:37.918 --> 01:13:40.170
Just show up.
or you'll regret it.

1300
01:13:41.505 --> 01:13:42.923
Chuck will kill me.

1301
01:13:42.923 --> 01:13:45.968
- I blew up Chuck's car.
- What?

1302
01:13:45.968 --> 01:13:47.803
Yeah.

1303
01:13:58.814 --> 01:14:01.316
Grain alcohol
is surprisingly flammable.

1304
01:14:01.316 --> 01:14:03.652
Luna. that's insane.
And a felony.

1305
01:14:03.652 --> 01:14:06.071
- Maybe.
- It is.

1306
01:14:06.071 --> 01:14:08.115
- But do you know why I did it?
- Because you're fucking nuts?

1307
01:14:08.115 --> 01:14:11.743
Because for a moment.
you gave everyone hope.

1308
01:14:11.743 --> 01:14:14.538
Look at all those people
whose lives you affected

1309
01:14:14.538 --> 01:14:16.540
just by being
an arrogant little shit

1310
01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:19.960
by refused to play
by the rules and be quiet.

1311
01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:23.297
Now everybody just thinks
I was using them for
some stupid bucket list.

1312
01:14:23.297 --> 01:14:26.300
But stay home
and hide from Chuck?

1313
01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:30.053
You'll be showing them
that they're right.

1314
01:14:33.765 --> 01:14:35.934
Well. I gotta get back
before lunch is over.

1315
01:14:43.817 --> 01:14:45.319
For you.

1316
01:14:47.154 --> 01:14:49.323
Later. fuckwad.

1317
01:15:07.799 --> 01:15:10.928
- I think we have to start over.
- You know how to tie a tie?

1318
01:15:10.928 --> 01:15:13.514
Can you get a YouTube video
just in case?

1319
01:15:13.514 --> 01:15:16.642
Oh. did you know that this
is called an oriental knot?

1320
01:15:16.642 --> 01:15:18.644
- It goes around
the tree trunk.
- Yeah.

1321
01:15:18.644 --> 01:15:21.396
- Did it.
- Photo time.

1322
01:15:27.194 --> 01:15:28.529
Oh. man. this is my song!

1323
01:15:39.206 --> 01:15:41.041
Get up.

1324
01:15:41.041 --> 01:15:45.087
- Get up.
- Nice cane.

1325
01:15:45.087 --> 01:15:49.424
- Thanks.
- Look. man. I'm sorry

1326
01:15:49.424 --> 01:15:51.218
about some of that stuff
that I said.

1327
01:15:51.218 --> 01:15:54.179
Yeah. you said
some pretty rough stuff.

1328
01:15:54.179 --> 01:15:56.056
I do think you care
a little bit too much

1329
01:15:56.056 --> 01:15:59.434
about being popular.
but I get it.

1330
01:15:59.434 --> 01:16:01.687
I know how good it felt
when I finally started
to get some attention.

1331
01:16:01.687 --> 01:16:03.897
so I don't blame you.

1332
01:16:03.897 --> 01:16:06.066
Boner brothers?

1333
01:16:06.066 --> 01:16:09.236
I thought that was you
and Dave Guggenheim's thing.

1334
01:16:09.236 --> 01:16:12.447
Come on. Jimenez.

1335
01:16:12.447 --> 01:16:14.074
You'll always be
my boner brother.

1336
01:16:15.450 --> 01:16:17.202
I'm gonna go spike the punch.

1337
01:16:24.459 --> 01:16:26.879
Give him some time.

1338
01:16:26.879 --> 01:16:28.422
Jim doesn't think very fast.

1339
01:16:31.466 --> 01:16:33.468
You look nice.

1340
01:16:33.468 --> 01:16:35.679
Thanks.

1341
01:16:35.679 --> 01:16:37.097
You look beautiful.

1342
01:16:37.097 --> 01:16:38.223
I know.

1343
01:16:42.269 --> 01:16:46.106
- Um. will you give me a second?
- Yeah.

1344
01:16:46.106 --> 01:16:50.152
Hey. Um. just--

1345
01:16:50.152 --> 01:16:52.112
- Hey. please.
- Sid. I don't wanna have
this conversation.

1346
01:16:52.112 --> 01:16:54.865
This isn't that.
It's not that conversation.

1347
01:16:54.865 --> 01:16:57.910
This isn't me saying
that I made a mistake.

1348
01:16:57.910 --> 01:17:01.496
or that there was
some big misunderstanding.

1349
01:17:01.496 --> 01:17:04.917
or even telling you that
you're the love of my life

1350
01:17:04.917 --> 01:17:06.919
or the only one for me
or anything.

1351
01:17:06.919 --> 01:17:08.754
This isn't even me
trying to win you back.

1352
01:17:08.754 --> 01:17:11.673
- Okay. then what is it?
- It's goodbye.

1353
01:17:14.301 --> 01:17:17.304
I just-- I wanted
to say that I've had

1354
01:17:17.304 --> 01:17:20.140
a lot of bad days
and a few good ones.

1355
01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:24.811
But the ones that
I spent with you. Katie.
were the best ones.

1356
01:17:24.811 --> 01:17:27.981
And I'm so thankful to you
for that.

1357
01:18:03.433 --> 01:18:04.476
You ready?

1358
01:18:08.272 --> 01:18:10.232
I am.

1359
01:18:10.232 --> 01:18:14.069
As I walk through the valley
of the shadow of high school.

1360
01:18:14.069 --> 01:18:17.406
I take with me my memories.
I leave behind my regrets.

1361
01:18:17.406 --> 01:18:20.492
I have loved. lost.
risen. fallen.

1362
01:18:20.492 --> 01:18:22.411
and now I face the beyond.

1363
01:18:22.411 --> 01:18:25.205
May my beatdown inspire those
who still live in fear.

1364
01:18:25.205 --> 01:18:29.293
I am Sid Sandagger.
and I am no longer afraid!

1365
01:18:29.293 --> 01:18:32.004
And I have lived!

1366
01:18:42.806 --> 01:18:45.142
Oh. shit. Oh. fuck.

1367
01:18:45.142 --> 01:18:46.560
How does this shit
fucking work?

1368
01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:50.063
That's definitely
not how it works.

1369
01:18:50.063 --> 01:18:53.567
Hey. buddy. How you feel?

1370
01:18:54.818 --> 01:18:56.195
I'm alive?

1371
01:18:56.195 --> 01:18:57.404
Yeah. you're alive.

1372
01:18:57.404 --> 01:19:00.032
I mean.
you look like a Picasso.

1373
01:19:00.032 --> 01:19:02.034
but you're alive.

1374
01:19:06.622 --> 01:19:08.624
- Oh. my God.
- What?

1375
01:19:08.624 --> 01:19:11.001
What happened to your face?

1376
01:19:11.001 --> 01:19:13.837
Oh. um. I think Luna
might've tagged me by accident.

1377
01:19:13.837 --> 01:19:15.297
She is so strong.

1378
01:19:15.297 --> 01:19:18.050
I think it's the low
center of gravity

1379
01:19:18.050 --> 01:19:21.553
- and the rage issues.
- So what happened?

1380
01:19:21.553 --> 01:19:24.181
You went unconscious
pretty quickly.
and then shit went down.

1381
01:19:26.099 --> 01:19:28.393
Coach: Break it up!

1382
01:19:28.393 --> 01:19:30.854
Dad. listen to me!
I'm a dancer!

1383
01:19:30.854 --> 01:19:31.855
What do you mean
you're a dancer?

1384
01:19:31.855 --> 01:19:33.065
Yeah!
You know what else?

1385
01:19:35.234 --> 01:19:37.486
I wanna dance!

1386
01:19:37.486 --> 01:19:38.820

1387
01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:40.656

carry canes!

1388
01:19:45.661 --> 01:19:47.287

1389
01:19:47.287 --> 01:19:51.250
- No. I thought we were bros!
- Motherfucker!

1390
01:19:51.250 --> 01:19:54.461
I'll kill you. you hear me?
I'll fucking kill you. bitch!
