[woman on TV]  A NASA spokeswoman has said 
"The agency's repeated attempts

228
00:12:12.815 --> 00:12:15.609
to contact the International Space Station
are failing."

229
00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.404
But stopped short 
of revealing possible causes.

230
00:12:18.612 --> 00:12:20.030
When asked if the ISS

231
00:12:20.114 --> 00:12:22.283
and it's three scientists onboard 
could be in danger.

232
00:12:22.366 --> 00:12:25.161
the agency held firm 
that it is doing everything it can

to restore communication.

00:12:26.662 --> 00:12:29.331

-[Carl]  Toy Story  was messed up.
-[Logan] How?

236
00:12:33.544 --> 00:12:35.504
Take the third one. for example.
that teenager.

they represent the brothers.

-We're the toys.
-Preach.

243
00:12:45.973 --> 00:12:48.517
And when the white man leaves the room.
we get to have fun.

244
00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:49.685
We get to shake it up.

245
00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:51.270
But when the white man
comes back in.

246
00:12:51.353 --> 00:12:53.272
we gotta get stiff
and do what they tell us to do.

247
00:12:53.355 --> 00:12:54.482
Now you're on my level.

248
00:12:54.565 --> 00:12:56.525
So it's obviously the ruling class 
justification

249
00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:58.736
for the inferior conditions
of the working class.

250

talking like black men from the '80s?

254
00:13:07.369 --> 00:13:09.580
-[Carl] That's what they want us to do.
-Preach. brother.

00:17:53.781 --> 00:17:54.782
[Dariush groans]

342
00:17:54.865 --> 00:17:55.699
You okay?

343
00:17:57.451 --> 00:17:58.368
Thanks.

344
00:17:59.244 --> 00:18:00.079
Yeah.

345
00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:04.041
-Who are you?
-My name is Gabriel.

346
00:18:05.542 --> 00:18:06.627
You live around here?

347
00:18:08.962 --> 00:18:10.339
Yeah. Yeah.

348
00:18:11.882 --> 00:18:14.218
You guys are from the. um. 
the camp. right?

349
00:18:17.596 --> 00:18:20.766
-She's not much of a talker.
-You know what? You know...

350
00:18:21.308 --> 00:18:23.143
You know what? That was a lucky punch.

351
00:18:23.268 --> 00:18:26.605
Lucky punch. Yeah. you know. 
I haven't acclimated to the altitudes yet.

352
00:18:26.688 --> 00:18:29.316
So my reflexes are kinda...
[pants] sub-par.

353
00:18:29.399 --> 00:18:31.401
[loud booms]

354
00:18:35.656 --> 00:18:37.658
[booming continues]

355
00:18:39.076 --> 00:18:40.285
What the hell was that?

356
00:18:41.036 --> 00:18:43.497
[cell phone alarms beeping]

357
00:18:44.832 --> 00:18:45.749
What does it say?

358
00:18:46.625 --> 00:18:48.418
It's the emergency broadcast system.

359
00:18:48.502 --> 00:18:52.089
"All civilians are to evacuate 
metropolitan areas immediately.

360
00:18:52.172 --> 00:18:55.217
Under no circumstances
approach  any unknown aircraft."

361
00:18:56.635 --> 00:18:57.928
It's the next 7-Eleven.

362
00:18:58.595 --> 00:18:59.972
We gotta get back to the van.

363
00:19:00.681 --> 00:19:01.723
Anyone know the way?

364
00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:03.350
-[Dariush] Uh...
-I do.

365
00:19:04.268 --> 00:19:05.144
Follow me.

366
00:19:05.227 --> 00:19:06.937
Okay. Whoa! Whoa.

367
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.523
Slow your roll. Dora the Explorer.
all right. this is my clique.

368
00:19:09.606 --> 00:19:11.275
Soldiers. out! [scoffs]

369
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:14.027
[Gabriel] Let's go.

370
00:19:14.945 --> 00:19:15.946
You guys know if--

371
00:19:17.823 --> 00:19:18.657
You--

372
00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:20.826
[sighs]

373
00:19:20.909 --> 00:19:22.870
[panting]

374
00:19:22.953 --> 00:19:23.996
Everyone's gone!

375
00:19:25.038 --> 00:19:26.123
[Dariush] Assholes!

376
00:19:28.041 --> 00:19:30.294
Probably got the emergency signal
and went back to camp.

377
00:19:30.377 --> 00:19:31.712
-[loud boom] 
-Oh!

378
00:19:35.757 --> 00:19:36.925
What the fu--?

379
00:19:37.509 --> 00:19:39.803
Looks like explosions.
in the upper atmosphere.

380
00:19:39.887 --> 00:19:42.181
[Gabriel] Call and have them send
the van to pick you up.

381
00:19:42.264 --> 00:19:44.808
It's dead!
I had 90% two seconds ago.

382
00:19:44.892 --> 00:19:46.143
Piece of shit Boost Mobile.

383
00:19:46.226 --> 00:19:47.311
Mine's dead. too.

384
00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:50.147
[distant whooshing]

385
00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:01.867
[jet engines roaring]

386
00:20:02.159 --> 00:20:03.827
-Whoa! Ah!
-Ah!

387
00:20:04.953 --> 00:20:06.622
Oh my God. it's  Independence Day.

388
00:20:07.331 --> 00:20:08.665
It's June. Gabriel!

389
00:20:10.125 --> 00:20:12.211
Oh. wait. maybe North Korea's invaded!

390
00:20:12.294 --> 00:20:13.337
Zhenzhen. call it off!

391
00:20:14.463 --> 00:20:17.674
We just need to wait here until the adults
realize they left us and come back.

392
00:20:17.758 --> 00:20:20.052
Oh. man! What if they never come back?

393
00:20:20.135 --> 00:20:21.887
I'm gonna die here with you losers?

394
00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:23.639
I never even had sex before!

395
00:20:27.267 --> 00:20:29.061
I'ma clear that up. I had sex...

396
00:20:29.228 --> 00:20:31.230
I had sex before. I mean...

397
00:20:31.313 --> 00:20:33.815
I haven't had sex with two girls at once.
That's what I mean.

398
00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:35.359
-I told you I had sex 'cause...
-No.

399
00:20:35.442 --> 00:20:38.737
All right. hey. look. We're not gonna die!
It's probably just a forest fire.

400
00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:40.906
We gotta get going. 
bears out here can be crazy.

401
00:20:40.989 --> 00:20:43.784
Whoa! Whoa! Okay. slow your roll.
Did you just say bears?

402
00:20:43.867 --> 00:20:45.702
I don't do so well with bears. man.

403
00:20:45.786 --> 00:20:47.913
I'm not trying to get DiCaprio'd 
up in here!

404
00:20:47.996 --> 00:20:51.416
-Look. no one does well with bears.
-Oh. whoa. Uh...

405
00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:53.418
ask Werner Herzog.

406
00:20:53.502 --> 00:20:56.755
Grizzly Man lived with those things 
for years. so check that out.

407
00:20:56.838 --> 00:20:58.966
-Did you watch the end of that movie?
-"Did I watch..."

408
00:20:59.049 --> 00:21:02.302
-Yeah. I watched-- No. I didn't.
-No. dude. Okay. stop. Gabriel's right.

409
00:21:02.386 --> 00:21:05.430
Black bears are opportunistic carnivores.
We're not gonna survive the wilderness

410
00:21:05.514 --> 00:21:08.433
-through the night.
-Then let's go! Come on!

411
00:21:09.476 --> 00:21:11.478
[all panting]

412
00:21:12.271 --> 00:21:13.313
[Dariush yelling] Hello!

413
00:21:14.856 --> 00:21:15.732
Hello!

414
00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:18.652
Where is everybody?

415
00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:20.904
Is anyone here?

416
00:21:21.738 --> 00:21:23.156
[Dariush] Yo. do you see anybody?

417
00:21:25.575 --> 00:21:26.827
What's that?

418
00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:28.036
"Gone down mountain..."

419
00:21:28.704 --> 00:21:30.205
Oh. they left us!

420
00:21:30.872 --> 00:21:31.873
Oh. sh--

421
00:21:32.708 --> 00:21:35.836
-Not all of them!
-[Dariush] Huh? It's Heavy Metal Conrad.

422
00:21:35.919 --> 00:21:37.337
-[Alex] Conrad!
-[Gabriel] Conrad!

423
00:21:37.754 --> 00:21:38.672
[Dariush] Is he dead?

424
00:21:39.548 --> 00:21:42.050
He's breathing. He must have slept
through  the evacuation.

425
00:21:42.134 --> 00:21:44.344
Okay. what kind of asshole 
sleeps through an evacuation?

426
00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.179
Wake him up.

427
00:21:49.266 --> 00:21:50.100
Uh...

428
00:21:53.228 --> 00:21:54.980
I don't think that... that was milk.

429
00:21:59.401 --> 00:22:00.235
Line's dead.

430
00:22:02.112 --> 00:22:03.196
It's 'cause the power's out.

431
00:22:04.281 --> 00:22:05.449
You know what an EMP is?

432
00:22:05.532 --> 00:22:08.160
Uh. yeah. yeah. yeah.
that's that music white people dance to.

433
00:22:08.452 --> 00:22:09.536
No. that's EDM!

434
00:22:09.703 --> 00:22:11.913
EPM stands for electromagnetic pulse.

435
00:22:12.539 --> 00:22:15.167
A nuclear explosion 
in the upper atmosphere can cause one.

436
00:22:15.709 --> 00:22:18.712
And it knocks out most electronics.
over a really big area.

437
00:22:19.129 --> 00:22:20.130
But what does that mean?

438
00:22:20.589 --> 00:22:22.215
It means nothing works.

439
00:22:22.591 --> 00:22:23.759
Not even cars?

440
00:22:24.217 --> 00:22:26.345
Well. you guys have food
and a roof over your head.

441
00:22:26.428 --> 00:22:27.888
You could do a lot worse than staying

442
00:22:27.971 --> 00:22:30.015
-and waiting this out.
-Wait. waiting what out?

443
00:22:30.098 --> 00:22:31.016
[loud explosion]

444
00:22:31.099 --> 00:22:32.809
Shit! Come on. come on. come on!

445
00:22:44.321 --> 00:22:46.490
Those are F-22 Raptor 
air superiority fighters.

446
00:22:47.074 --> 00:22:49.076
[Gabriel] What are those ships 
they're fighting?

447
00:22:49.159 --> 00:22:51.036
I've never seen anything like them.

448
00:22:51.578 --> 00:22:53.080
[engines roaring]

449
00:22:53.163 --> 00:22:56.124
[Dariush]
Run! Go. get the hell out here. Go!

450
00:22:56.249 --> 00:22:58.043
-[gunfire]
-Hurry up!

451
00:22:59.002 --> 00:23:00.212
Go. go. go!

452
00:23:00.587 --> 00:23:02.589
-Move out of the way!
-[guns blasting]

453
00:23:03.924 --> 00:23:05.342
[Alex] Come on. come on!

454
00:23:05.967 --> 00:23:06.927
Go!

455
00:23:07.928 --> 00:23:09.429
Oh! Look out!

456
00:23:09.513 --> 00:23:11.098
-Look out. look out!
-Whoa!

457
00:23:12.182 --> 00:23:14.059
[all grunting]

458
00:23:14.518 --> 00:23:16.353
[groaning]

459
00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.275
-[gunfire blasting]
-[engines roaring]

460
00:23:22.442 --> 00:23:23.777
What's going on?

461
00:23:28.615 --> 00:23:29.533
What?

462
00:23:36.915 --> 00:23:38.333
[yelling]

463
00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:42.045
[all groaning]

464
00:23:44.548 --> 00:23:46.383
What is that? [coughing]

465
00:23:46.466 --> 00:23:49.886
-[Alex] It's a Dragon capsule.
-[Gabriel] How do you know all this stuff?

466
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.514
There's a reason my mom sent me 
to outdoor camp.

467
00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:54.683
[Dariush] Oh. God. that thing's huge.

468
00:23:55.434 --> 00:23:56.268
What the hell?

469
00:23:56.351 --> 00:23:58.019
-No. don't touch it! Dude!
-Oh! Ah!

470
00:23:58.103 --> 00:23:59.438
It's still hot from re-entry.

471
00:23:59.813 --> 00:24:02.274
-Oh. does anyone have any water?
-[Alex] Good idea.

472
00:24:02.691 --> 00:24:03.525
Thanks. thanks.

473
00:24:04.192 --> 00:24:06.111
[gulping] Mmm...

474
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:08.029
You serious?

475
00:24:10.115 --> 00:24:10.991
-What?
-Gimme it.

476
00:24:11.074 --> 00:24:11.908
What?

477
00:24:12.367 --> 00:24:13.243
[water hissing]

478
00:24:13.326 --> 00:24:15.036
You're not gonna open that thing. are you?

479
00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.580
There could be someone inside.

480
00:24:16.663 --> 00:24:18.123
No. leave it be. All right?

481
00:24:18.707 --> 00:24:21.376
-[Alex] What?
-We don't know what this shit is.

482
00:24:21.877 --> 00:24:23.628
-[Alex] Don't touch it.
-[sniffs] Ew.

483
00:24:23.712 --> 00:24:25.630
This is animal kingdom out here. bitches.

484
00:24:25.714 --> 00:24:27.841
All right. survival of the fit--

485
00:24:27.924 --> 00:24:28.758
[clangs]

486
00:24:37.893 --> 00:24:40.145
Hello. Is... is anybody in here?

487
00:24:50.155 --> 00:24:52.324
-[all] Ah!
-[moaning]

488
00:24:52.407 --> 00:24:53.283
[Alex] Guys!

489
00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.661
[Dariush] Come on. come on. come on!

490
00:24:56.745 --> 00:24:58.747
I thought space was supposed 
to make you weightless?

491
00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:00.957
-[screams]
-[Alex] We're not in space. dude.

492
00:25:02.459 --> 00:25:04.586
[wheezing. groaning]

493
00:25:04.711 --> 00:25:07.130
-Where am I?
-At Rim of the World Adventure Camp.

494
00:25:07.214 --> 00:25:08.840
-Near Big Bear.
-This is a camp?

495
00:25:09.132 --> 00:25:10.550
Yeah. I was disappointed too. but...

496
00:25:11.009 --> 00:25:12.469
Coordinates all wrong.

497
00:25:13.011 --> 00:25:14.971
Pasadena... Dr. Fielding.

498
00:25:15.055 --> 00:25:17.474
I'm sorry. but we're not near Pasadena
right now.

499
00:25:17.557 --> 00:25:19.309
-JPL!
-JPL?

500
00:25:19.392 --> 00:25:21.520
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
It's part of NASA.

501
00:25:21.603 --> 00:25:23.188
[Gabriel] Try not to move as much. okay?

502
00:25:23.313 --> 00:25:25.232
-Try not to move as much.
-The key!

503
00:25:25.857 --> 00:25:26.691
The key.

504
00:25:26.858 --> 00:25:28.985
Take it to JPL. Dr. Fielding.

505
00:25:29.069 --> 00:25:31.363
It has everything on it. 
Excalibur. everything.

506
00:25:31.446 --> 00:25:33.240
-[creature snarling] 
-Go!

507
00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:35.075
[Dariush] What the actual shit?

508
00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:38.161
-You're gonna die if we leave you.
-We'll all die if you don't!

509
00:25:38.745 --> 00:25:39.913
Run!

510
00:25:42.958 --> 00:25:44.084
[screaming]

511
00:25:45.794 --> 00:25:46.962
Was that an alien?

512
00:25:47.087 --> 00:25:48.004
[Gabriel] Run!

513
00:25:49.464 --> 00:25:50.966
Keep going. come on! Let's go!

514

Hey. wait! Wait. wait!

521

How big was it?

522
00:26:15.031 --> 00:26:17.993
Was it. like. puppy-size? 
'Cause maybe it just wants to cuddle.

We gotta let 'em in. we gotta let 'em in!

613

No. What are you doing? "Let them in." No!

614
00:31:46.696 --> 00:31:49.198
Zhenzhen? Zhenzhen.

615

Alex. you're welcome.

622

I put the dog on fire for you guys!

623
00:32:19.479 --> 00:32:21.981
And Gabriel was selfish 
and he didn't help at all.

624
00:32:22.357 --> 00:32:25.360
What button do I press to open 
this window? Help me!

625
00:32:29.364 --> 00:32:30.323
Go.

626

[Gabriel grunting]

627
00:32:35.078 --> 00:32:35.995

[Dariush wheezes]

639
00:33:14.742 --> 00:33:16.452
I didn't sign up for this shit. man.

640
00:33:16.536 --> 00:33:17.870
[Gabriel] This can't be real.

641
00:33:18.997 --> 00:33:21.624
What about this isn't real?
He just sneeze-jizzed all over us!

642
00:33:21.708 --> 00:33:24.002
Just shut up. I can't think 
with your constant bitching.

643
00:33:24.085 --> 00:33:27.880
Hey. I'm allowed to bitch. all right?
That thing had its tongue in my mouth.

644
00:33:27.964 --> 00:33:29.340
How do you know it was its tongue?

645
00:33:29.799 --> 00:33:30.883
We don't know their anatomy.

646
00:33:30.967 --> 00:33:32.010
What are you saying?

647
00:33:32.093 --> 00:33:34.470
Honestly. it's plausible that 
sophisticated creatures.

648
00:33:34.554 --> 00:33:36.681
like alien males. have cranial genitalia.

649
00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:42.353
It had its dick in my mouth?

650
00:33:43.438 --> 00:33:44.522
Yeah.

651
00:33:45.773 --> 00:33:46.774
Uh-uh.

652
00:33:46.899 --> 00:33:48.317
Guys. we need to stay calm. okay?

653
00:33:48.401 --> 00:33:49.610
We need to stay calm.

654
00:33:50.111 --> 00:33:51.362
Calm? [scoffs]

655
00:33:51.446 --> 00:33:54.657
I just probably swallowed 
a load of alien babies

656
00:33:54.741 --> 00:33:57.535
that are gonna turn into puppies
and leap out of my chest.

657
00:33:57.618 --> 00:33:59.620
I need to find my mom. 
she's gonna know what to do.

658
00:33:59.704 --> 00:34:00.955
If she's alive.

659
00:34:01.205 --> 00:34:02.582
Hey. don't say that.

660
00:34:02.665 --> 00:34:04.375
Chances are our parents are gone. 
all right!

661
00:34:04.459 --> 00:34:06.252
Hey. what did I say about 
touching that kid?

662
00:34:06.461 --> 00:34:08.421
What are you gonna do?
Gonna sucker punch me again?

663
00:34:08.504 --> 00:34:10.423
Go for it.
'cause I chop your ass in the neck.

664
00:34:10.506 --> 00:34:11.883
and then I'll chop you in the head

665
00:34:11.966 --> 00:34:14.469
-and finish you with a rear-naked choke.
-Do you ever shut up?

666
00:34:14.552 --> 00:34:16.721
I mean. between my fist 
and that alien's dick.

667
00:34:16.804 --> 00:34:18.931
your mouth should be worn out by now.

668
00:34:19.015 --> 00:34:19.932
[screaming]

669
00:34:22.268 --> 00:34:23.519
Why are you hitting me?

670
00:34:23.603 --> 00:34:25.021
What we do in life...

671
00:34:25.855 --> 00:34:27.523
echoes in eternity.

672
00:34:29.484 --> 00:34:30.526
What the fuck?

673
00:34:32.153 --> 00:34:33.154
[Zhenzhen] Hold the line!

674
00:34:33.988 --> 00:34:34.989
Stay with me.

675
00:34:35.782 --> 00:34:38.367
If you find yourself alone. 
riding in green fields

676
00:34:38.451 --> 00:34:40.286
with the sun on your face.
do not be troubled.

677
00:34:41.037 --> 00:34:42.663
For you are in Elysium.

678
00:34:43.039 --> 00:34:44.415
and you're already dead.

679
00:34:46.959 --> 00:34:48.711
Did she just quote  Gladiator?

680
00:34:49.045 --> 00:34:50.838
Since when did she speak English?

681
00:34:51.714 --> 00:34:52.965
Since when does she speak?

682
00:34:53.966 --> 00:34:55.718
-May I ask where we're going?
-My jaw hurts...

683
00:34:55.802 --> 00:34:57.220
The astronaut said that this key

684
00:34:57.303 --> 00:34:59.889
can stop the aliens 
and we need to take it to TRL.

685
00:35:00.098 --> 00:35:01.099
JPL.

686
00:35:01.182 --> 00:35:03.726
-A NASA facility.
-[Dariush] Tastes like truffle butter.

687
00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:05.269
In the foothills of Pasadena.

688
00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:08.773
I went there once for a robotics contest 
with my dad.

689
00:35:08.898 --> 00:35:11.067
-Do you know how to get there?
-Without GPS?

690
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:13.986
No. probably not.
It's over 70 miles away from here.

691
00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:15.404
Whoa. whoa. whoa. what?

692
00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:18.407
Wait. you wanna head 70 miles 
into the city?

693
00:35:18.491 --> 00:35:20.743
The alert said stay out 
of metropolitan areas.

694
00:35:20.827 --> 00:35:21.953
not head straight into them.

695
00:35:22.036 --> 00:35:24.080
We don't have to take it all the way 
to Pasadena.

696
00:35:24.664 --> 00:35:27.583
Let's just get this key down the mountain
and take it to adults.

697
00:35:27.667 --> 00:35:29.585
Tell them to take it to JPL.

698
00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:31.963
[sighing] Oh. my gosh.

699
00:35:33.673 --> 00:35:34.507
Guys.

700
00:35:35.424 --> 00:35:38.386
There's a sheriff's station down a bit. 
we could get it to a cop.

701
00:35:38.469 --> 00:35:40.138
That's a great idea. Gabriel.

702
00:35:40.221 --> 00:35:42.765
Now. let's get some bikes 
and kick some ass.

703
00:35:44.225 --> 00:35:45.977
[Dariush] Damn. girl. 
your English is good.

704
00:35:46.561 --> 00:35:48.938
They gave us the code at registration.
it's. um...

705
00:35:49.021 --> 00:35:49.939
six-six-nine.

706
00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:51.899
Come on. man.

707
00:35:52.984 --> 00:35:54.777
[locks turning]

708
00:35:54.861 --> 00:35:57.029
[Dariush] Hurry up. dude. Come on.
It's six-six-nine.

709
00:35:57.321 --> 00:35:58.781
[Gabriel] Six... nine...

710
00:35:58.865 --> 00:36:01.033
Dude. what are you talking about?
I said six-six-nine.

711
00:36:01.868 --> 00:36:05.371
Come on. man. Dude. hurry up!
Just put it in there. What are you. dumb?

712
00:36:07.623 --> 00:36:08.457
I'm not dumb.

713
00:36:09.083 --> 00:36:11.169
Here. Gabriel. Let me help you.

714
00:36:12.545 --> 00:36:15.006
I want this one. 
it's got a 'Wakanda Forever' sticker.

715
00:36:22.722 --> 00:36:24.432
Hey... what's wrong?

716
00:36:24.849 --> 00:36:25.850
I can't go with you.

717
00:36:27.476 --> 00:36:28.311
Why not?

718
00:36:29.854 --> 00:36:30.855
I can't ride a bike.

719
00:36:31.564 --> 00:36:32.440
I never learned.

720
00:36:34.192 --> 00:36:35.109
It's okay.

721
00:36:35.776 --> 00:36:37.153
You guys can go without me.

722
00:36:37.278 --> 00:36:38.905
-[Dariush] Cool. we out!
-[Gabriel] No.

723
00:36:38.988 --> 00:36:41.115
We got back down to your camp
and everyone left you.

724
00:36:41.199 --> 00:36:42.491
how did that make you feel?

725
00:36:42.575 --> 00:36:45.077
All right. you get on one side of Alex 
and you get on the other.

726
00:36:45.161 --> 00:36:46.537
and we'll get him up to speed.

727
00:36:46.621 --> 00:36:47.580
-Gotcha.
-All right?

728
00:36:50.625 --> 00:36:51.959
I won't let you fall.

729
00:37:01.344 --> 00:37:02.261
You guys are...

730
00:37:03.429 --> 00:37:04.263
I...

731
00:37:06.432 --> 00:37:07.475
[sighs]

732
00:37:13.314 --> 00:37:14.273
[Dariush] You got this.

733
00:37:14.523 --> 00:37:16.359
Put your feet back on the pedal.

734
00:37:16.442 --> 00:37:18.152
[Gabriel] The key is to get moving.

735
00:37:18.236 --> 00:37:20.863
The faster you go.
the easier it is to stay balanced.

736
00:37:21.197 --> 00:37:22.657
Are you sure about this?

737
00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:24.909
[Gabriel] No.

738
00:37:25.493 --> 00:37:26.577
[Dariush] Good. you're good.

739
00:37:28.246 --> 00:37:29.664
Now. just keep doing that.

740
00:37:34.252 --> 00:37:35.878
I don't... I don't know if I can do this.

741
00:37:35.962 --> 00:37:36.796
Alex.

742
00:37:37.505 --> 00:37:38.714
You're already doing it.

743
00:37:38.881 --> 00:37:41.092
[all cheering]

744
00:37:42.385 --> 00:37:43.636
[Zhenzhen] You're doing it!

745
00:37:45.304 --> 00:37:46.222
[Alex] Yeah!

746
00:37:46.847 --> 00:37:47.890
[Zhenzhen] You're doing it.

747
00:37:47.974 --> 00:37:49.016
[Dariush] Yeah. boy!

748
00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:50.768
-[Zhenzhen] Whoo!
-[Gabriel] Look at him.

749
00:37:50.851 --> 00:37:53.145
Oh. my God.
Oh. my God. you guys. I'm doing it!

750
00:37:54.939 --> 00:37:55.940
Whoo-hoo!

751
00:37:59.318 --> 00:38:00.653
Whoo!

752
00:38:06.492 --> 00:38:07.410
Yeah!

753
00:38:07.868 --> 00:38:09.787
[vocalizing]

754
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:11.455
This is so much fun. you--

755
00:38:13.124 --> 00:38:14.375
-[Dariush] Oh!
-[Zhenzhen] Alex?

756
00:38:17.003 --> 00:38:18.587
-Are you okay?
-Yo. is he dead?

757
00:38:18.671 --> 00:38:19.505
[Gabriel] Alex?

758
00:38:20.214 --> 00:38:21.549
-You okay?
-[Dariush] Yo. you good?

759
00:38:21.632 --> 00:38:22.508
[Zhenzhen] You okay?

760
00:38:24.802 --> 00:38:25.636
You okay?

761
00:38:26.178 --> 00:38:28.681
[distant explosions]

762
00:38:28.764 --> 00:38:29.724
Holy sh...

763
00:38:29.807 --> 00:38:30.933
Yeah. like holy...

764
00:38:31.809 --> 00:38:32.685
shit!

765
00:38:36.689 --> 00:38:37.982
[gunfire]

766
00:38:42.611 --> 00:38:43.654
[Zhenzhen] You all right?

767
00:38:44.113 --> 00:38:45.614
[Dariush] Is that where we're going?

768
00:38:50.369 --> 00:38:52.371
[wheezing]

769
00:38:53.164 --> 00:38:55.166
[bullets clattering]

770
00:39:00.421 --> 00:39:02.423
[growling]

771
00:39:09.513 --> 00:39:11.432
[roaring]

772
00:39:20.149 --> 00:39:21.567
[distant explosions]

773
00:39:31.035 --> 00:39:31.869
There!

774
00:39:32.286 --> 00:39:34.080
Man. this place is trashed.

775
00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:35.664
Looks empty.

776
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:37.083
[Gabriel] Guys. I don't...

777
00:39:37.416 --> 00:39:38.417
Nobody's. uh...

778
00:39:40.669 --> 00:39:41.504
What?

779
00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:45.216
You guys go ahead. I'll just
stay back and watch our bikes.

780
00:39:45.299 --> 00:39:46.217
What?

781
00:39:46.675 --> 00:39:49.512
Oh. yeah. because the aliens
wanna jack our mountain bikes.

782
00:39:51.806 --> 00:39:52.973
Yeah. looters could take them.

783
00:39:53.724 --> 00:39:55.142
Yeah. someone should stay and watch.

784
00:39:58.771 --> 00:39:59.647
Whatever. man.

785
00:40:07.196 --> 00:40:08.864
[Alex] Hello? Officers?

786
00:40:08.989 --> 00:40:10.783
[Dariush] Shh! What if people are in here?

787
00:40:11.033 --> 00:40:12.284
[Alex] What do you mean. "shh"?

788
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:16.789
[Dariush]
If I see a clown on a tricycle. I'm out.

789
00:40:16.872 --> 00:40:18.582
-[Alex] Yes. we should go back.
-No!

790
00:40:19.333 --> 00:40:20.751
We always move forward.

791
00:40:21.502 --> 00:40:22.461
Come on.

792
00:40:24.964 --> 00:40:25.965
Okay. offices.

793
00:40:29.844 --> 00:40:31.053
[Dariush] What? It's a warning.

794
00:40:34.682 --> 00:40:37.309
"Nuclear weapons authorized 
for Los Angeles Basin.

795
00:40:37.393 --> 00:40:38.894
Europe destroyed.

796
00:40:40.813 --> 00:40:43.149
Asia... decimated."

797
00:40:43.524 --> 00:40:44.442
[Alex] Hello?

798
00:40:47.361 --> 00:40:48.362
Hello?

799
00:40:52.074 --> 00:40:53.367
"Primary directive:

800
00:40:54.285 --> 00:40:56.203
locate alien power source."

801
00:40:57.872 --> 00:40:58.831
What?

802
00:41:02.418 --> 00:41:03.377
Anybody?

803
00:41:09.008 --> 00:41:09.884
[man] Hey.

804
00:41:09.967 --> 00:41:10.885
[gasps]

805
00:41:12.553 --> 00:41:14.305
Oh. hey. Don't be scared.

806
00:41:14.763 --> 00:41:16.056
[grunts] Come on.

807
00:41:16.599 --> 00:41:17.600
Come on.

808
00:41:17.683 --> 00:41:18.642
Hey.

809
00:41:19.685 --> 00:41:20.728
What's your name?

810
00:41:22.688 --> 00:41:23.522
Alex.

811
00:41:24.315 --> 00:41:25.399
My name's Lou.

812
00:41:26.775 --> 00:41:28.152
See those keys right there?

813
00:41:29.612 --> 00:41:31.030
Can you get 'em for me?

814
00:41:31.113 --> 00:41:34.450
Alex. you're not gonna believe what
I just saw. man. It can't get any worse.

815
00:41:36.118 --> 00:41:37.912
Oh. shit! What...

816
00:41:37.995 --> 00:41:41.207
-[whispers] He wants me to let him go.
-[Dariush] What. you-- Oh. no.

817
00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:43.334
No. that's not going to happen.
Not today. Not at all.

818
00:41:43.417 --> 00:41:44.335
What's going on?

819
00:41:44.418 --> 00:41:47.046
Oh. what? They just evacuate
and leave me in here?

820
00:41:47.588 --> 00:41:50.341
-So whatever it is up there can kill me?
-They're aliens.

821
00:41:50.424 --> 00:41:53.928
And I suggest you keep your mouth 
closed when they get up in here. 'cause...

822
00:41:54.345 --> 00:41:55.262
When it...

823
00:41:55.346 --> 00:41:56.639
What'd you do?

824
00:41:58.599 --> 00:41:59.683
I was trying to help.

825
00:42:00.601 --> 00:42:02.436
Yeah. it got a little crazy out there.

826
00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.606
Look. Alex. you can stay here 
and flirt with Buffalo Bill all day long.

827
00:42:05.689 --> 00:42:09.360
All right? But let's get rid of that
astro-key so someone can stop this thing.

828
00:42:10.402 --> 00:42:12.780
So that key's gonna stop this thing?
[scoffs gently]

829
00:42:14.031 --> 00:42:15.241
Come on. man.

830
00:42:15.616 --> 00:42:19.411
Dariush. it shouldn't be our job
to decide who lives and who dies.

831
00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:21.914
Yeah. But right now it is. Alex.

832
00:42:21.997 --> 00:42:24.333
The police obviously put him
in here for a reason.

833
00:42:24.416 --> 00:42:27.086
All right. and I say... 
we respect their decision.

834
00:42:27.169 --> 00:42:28.087
and I'm black!

835
00:42:28.170 --> 00:42:30.130
And he's probably a diddler.

836
00:42:30.214 --> 00:42:32.299
No one deserves to be left in a cage.

837
00:42:32.383 --> 00:42:34.134
Yeah. unless you're a murderer!

838
00:42:34.218 --> 00:42:35.469
I say we let him go.

839
00:42:35.761 --> 00:42:37.596
What do you say. Alex?
You're the final vote.

840
00:42:41.517 --> 00:42:43.310
Okay. Look. I got a boy at home.

841
00:42:44.895 --> 00:42:46.480
And if you leave me in here...

842
00:42:48.232 --> 00:42:49.316
I'm gonna die.

843
00:42:50.818 --> 00:42:53.112
No boy deserves to lose 
his dad like that. right?

844
00:42:53.654 --> 00:42:54.530
I mean...

845
00:42:54.989 --> 00:42:56.407
you ready to live with that?

846
00:42:58.576 --> 00:43:00.452
Do you promise not to hurt us?

847
00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:03.122
Yeah. I promise not to hurt you. man.

848
00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:13.716
Wait until we leave.

849
00:43:15.092 --> 00:43:16.135
Then you can go.

850
00:43:25.102 --> 00:43:27.646
[Zhenzhen] How is your watch still working
after the pulse?

851
00:43:28.063 --> 00:43:29.940
It's not electronic. it's mechanical.

852
00:43:30.024 --> 00:43:31.650
-Yo. he's doing good. right?
-Oh.

853
00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:34.111
[Dariush] Yo. Watch out!

854
00:43:34.194 --> 00:43:35.362
It was my dad's.

855
00:43:37.114 --> 00:43:38.991
-He. uh...
-[Zhenzhen] Gave it to you?

856
00:43:40.242 --> 00:43:42.953
-Yeah. he gave it to me.
-[Dariush] Yo!

857
00:43:43.037 --> 00:43:45.039
You got this. Alex. You doing good. man!

858
00:43:47.666 --> 00:43:48.500
Whoa!

859
00:43:51.337 --> 00:43:53.380
-Hey! Hey!
-[kids yelling]

860
00:43:53.464 --> 00:43:55.466
-Help!
-Stop!

861
00:43:55.549 --> 00:43:56.967
-Hey!
-Stop!

862
00:43:57.051 --> 00:43:57.885
Hey!

863
00:43:57.968 --> 00:43:59.845
[soldier] Stay where you are.
Do not move!

864
00:44:01.221 --> 00:44:02.890
[Alex] Same side. Same side. Same side!

865
00:44:04.141 --> 00:44:05.601
Kids! Kids!

866
00:44:07.227 --> 00:44:09.563
You should've evacuated hours ago.
We're at war.

867
00:44:09.647 --> 00:44:12.066
Sir. we were in the mountains 
when the attacks started.

868
00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:15.027
Can you tell us what's going on? 
How big is the attack?

869
00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:17.237
Did it reach the nation's finest 
Mercedes dealership?

870
00:44:17.321 --> 00:44:19.239
-[Zhenzhen] Dude. how can you...
-My dad owns it.

871
00:44:19.323 --> 00:44:20.616
-I'm the future heir.
-Shut up!

872
00:44:20.699 --> 00:44:22.368
All I can tell you
is you are not safe here.

873
00:44:22.451 --> 00:44:23.952
Everyone on the bus right now.

874
00:44:24.036 --> 00:44:25.579
It'll take you to the evacuation center.

875
00:44:25.663 --> 00:44:26.789
-Let's go! 
-[Dariush] Whoa.

876
00:44:26.872 --> 00:44:28.082
-Hey. wait!
-Let's go!

877
00:44:28.165 --> 00:44:29.958
-Knock it off!
-Wait! Hey! Stop!

878
00:44:30.042 --> 00:44:30.876
What?

879
00:44:31.043 --> 00:44:33.045
You need to take this key to Pasadena.

880
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:35.464
Where'd you get this?

881
00:44:35.547 --> 00:44:37.466
An astronaut from the space station
gave it to us.

882
00:44:37.549 --> 00:44:40.636
-She said we need to take it to JPL.
-What's on that key can stop the aliens.

883
00:44:40.719 --> 00:44:43.764
You need to get that to JPL in Pasadena 
to a Dr. Fielding.

884
00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:47.267
We've been receiving Morse code 
from a Dr. Fielding at JPL all day.

885
00:44:47.351 --> 00:44:50.396
Finding this key has been 
the primary objective. Thanks. kid.

886
00:44:50.479 --> 00:44:52.022
You may have just saved the world.

887
00:44:52.731 --> 00:44:53.774
We'll take it from here.

888
00:44:53.857 --> 00:44:55.693
Okay. we need to go. Move out. Now!

889
00:44:55.776 --> 00:44:58.195
-Yeah.
-Yeah! We did it! Yo. we did--

890
00:44:58.278 --> 00:45:01.281
Yo. I am so happy I told y'all
to go down the hill.

891
00:45:02.574 --> 00:45:03.992
Great job. guys. you did it.

892
00:45:04.702 --> 00:45:06.745
[Dariush]
Yeah. we did it. Now move your ass.

893
00:45:08.163 --> 00:45:09.123
Let's go!

894
00:45:10.416 --> 00:45:11.667
-Yo.
-[Zhenzhen] We did it.

895
00:45:13.001 --> 00:45:14.420
[Dariush] Zhenzhen. we did it.

896
00:45:14.503 --> 00:45:16.255
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

897
00:45:17.506 --> 00:45:18.340
[Dariush sighs]

898
00:45:18.424 --> 00:45:19.341
Look!

899
00:45:21.009 --> 00:45:21.969
There they go.

900
00:45:23.387 --> 00:45:24.930
-[guns blasting]
-[explosion]

901
00:45:25.514 --> 00:45:26.765
[man screaming]

902
00:45:31.395 --> 00:45:32.438
[glass shattering]

903
00:45:32.521 --> 00:45:34.857
[all screaming]

904
00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:36.275
[Alex] Oh. my... Shit!

905
00:45:36.358 --> 00:45:37.609
[Gabriel] Alex. are you okay?

906
00:45:37.776 --> 00:45:38.610
Alex!

907
00:45:39.862 --> 00:45:40.738
[man] Get out of here.

908
00:45:40.821 --> 00:45:42.573
-Go!
-[Gabriel] Which door is blocked?

909
00:45:42.656 --> 00:45:43.532
[soldier] Take cover!

910
00:45:44.491 --> 00:45:45.701
Go.

911
00:45:45.784 --> 00:45:46.910
Come on!

912
00:45:46.994 --> 00:45:48.662
-Let's go!
-[man] Move!

913
00:45:48.746 --> 00:45:50.706
[Dariush] Let's go.
We gotta get out of here. man!

914
00:45:50.789 --> 00:45:51.665
[man] Get out of here.

915
00:45:52.124 --> 00:45:53.709
[Dariush] Kick it!

916
00:45:53.834 --> 00:45:56.086
-Go! Go. go. go!
-[rapid gunfire]

917
00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:57.171
[woman] Let's go. out!

918
00:45:57.296 --> 00:45:59.173
[Dariush] Go! Oh. shit!

919
00:45:59.256 --> 00:46:00.591
Go the other way.

920
00:46:02.342 --> 00:46:03.594
Watch out for the dogs!

921
00:46:04.845 --> 00:46:06.180
-[gunshots]
-[roaring]

922
00:46:06.263 --> 00:46:07.222
[Alex] Come on!

923
00:46:07.306 --> 00:46:08.849
[Dariush] Go! Go! Go!

924
00:46:09.516 --> 00:46:10.851
Keep your head down. man!

925
00:46:14.021 --> 00:46:15.606
Holy shit! Oh. no!

926
00:46:16.315 --> 00:46:17.941
-Pick this up with me.
-What are you doing?

927
00:46:18.025 --> 00:46:19.860
-Pick it up with me.
-You gotta get out of here.

928
00:46:20.486 --> 00:46:22.780
-We're gonna get you out!
-[captain] Stop. you gotta go.

929
00:46:22.863 --> 00:46:23.947
I can't move it by myself!

930
00:46:24.031 --> 00:46:25.616
-[explosion]
-[captain] You have to go.

931
00:46:25.699 --> 00:46:27.117
[radio beeping Morse code]

932
00:46:27.201 --> 00:46:28.660
[Dariush]
Yo. Zhenzhen. get the radio.

933
00:46:28.994 --> 00:46:30.204
Come on. we can't leave you.

934
00:46:30.287 --> 00:46:31.163
Stop. Stop.

935
00:46:31.872 --> 00:46:32.790
It's okay.

936
00:46:33.707 --> 00:46:34.750
It's on you now. Okay?

937
00:46:35.542 --> 00:46:37.002
You have to let me go.

938
00:46:37.669 --> 00:46:39.338
-[Alex] No. no. I... I can't!
-Shh.

939
00:46:39.421 --> 00:46:40.714
-No!
-Stop!

940
00:46:41.173 --> 00:46:42.883
Take this key. Here. take it.

941
00:46:44.134 --> 00:46:45.135
Promise me.

942
00:46:45.219 --> 00:46:46.220
Promise me...

943
00:46:47.054 --> 00:46:49.389
you will not let anything stop you.

944
00:46:49.932 --> 00:46:50.849
Okay?

945
00:46:51.016 --> 00:46:52.309
Okay. now go. Go!

946
00:46:52.684 --> 00:46:53.852
Now! Move!

947
00:46:54.019 --> 00:46:54.937
Come on!

948
00:46:55.103 --> 00:46:56.605
[heavy gunfire]

949
00:47:06.824 --> 00:47:08.826
[distant gunfire]

950
00:47:12.246 --> 00:47:13.914
[Dariush panting]

951
00:47:14.122 --> 00:47:14.998
Oh. shit!

952
00:47:15.249 --> 00:47:17.292
I told you that was a stupid idea.

953
00:47:17.417 --> 00:47:19.044
You idiots almost got me killed.

954
00:47:19.378 --> 00:47:20.963
I don't even wanna be at summer camp.

955
00:47:21.046 --> 00:47:24.007
I should be in Cabo taking jelly shots
off someone's ass cheeks.

956
00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:26.468
Slow down. Slow down.

957
00:47:26.552 --> 00:47:28.637
What do you think these things are after?

958
00:47:28.929 --> 00:47:30.848
Food maybe? Resources?

959
00:47:30.931 --> 00:47:34.101
It's possible their planet went dry
and the came to raid ours.

960
00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:36.436
What gives you that idea?

961
00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:39.356
Nothing! It's the most common
invasion movie plot.

962
00:47:39.439 --> 00:47:40.983
Maybe they're here to find mates.

963
00:47:41.066 --> 00:47:43.986
That would explain the erotic rendezvous
with Dariush earlier.

964
00:47:44.069 --> 00:47:46.154
Hey. whoa. No.
We're not gonna do all that. okay?

965
00:47:46.238 --> 00:47:47.614
That was strictly platonic.

966
00:47:48.115 --> 00:47:50.117
Let's just head north. okay? 
To the desert.

967
00:47:50.367 --> 00:47:53.287
Get as far away from that thing 
as we can get. all right?

968
00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:56.582
-As far away--
-There is no away from those things.

969
00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.292
[Alex] Zhenzhen's right.

970
00:47:58.375 --> 00:48:01.587
The only way we're going to survive 
is if we get this key to Dr. Fielding.

971
00:48:01.837 --> 00:48:04.089
-It's what that soldier was gonna do.
-He died.

972
00:48:04.172 --> 00:48:06.967
Okay. look. if a bunch of bad-ass marines
can't get that key

973
00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:08.677
40 feet away without getting deep fried.

974
00:48:09.136 --> 00:48:11.972
what makes you think 
that we can get it 40 miles?

975
00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:14.016
We have to.

976
00:48:14.349 --> 00:48:15.183
What?

977
00:48:15.934 --> 00:48:16.810
It's on us.

978
00:48:19.897 --> 00:48:22.524
Okay. We're not going anywhere 
until we get some food.

979
00:48:22.858 --> 00:48:24.526
Maybe even some sleep if we can.

980
00:48:25.277 --> 00:48:26.528
[Dariush] All right. fine.

981
00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:29.239
What's up with Chico?

982
00:48:32.951 --> 00:48:35.120
-It's my street.
-Great!

983
00:48:35.537 --> 00:48:36.580
Can we go in your house?

984
00:48:38.248 --> 00:48:39.708
That's my house. but...

985
00:48:40.542 --> 00:48:42.669
[sniffles. sighs]

986
00:48:42.753 --> 00:48:43.837
It's not my home.

987
00:48:44.796 --> 00:48:47.257
I haven't been totally honest 
with you guys.

988
00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:50.010
I was in the mountains because...

989
00:48:51.094 --> 00:48:52.179
I was in juvie.

990
00:48:53.221 --> 00:48:54.222
And I escaped.

991
00:48:58.435 --> 00:48:59.978
So even if my mom is here...

992
00:49:01.897 --> 00:49:03.398
she's not gonna wanna see me.

993
00:49:06.151 --> 00:49:07.736
[distant gunfire]

994
00:49:12.741 --> 00:49:13.909
Come on. man.

995
00:49:19.414 --> 00:49:21.458
[spacecraft approaching]

996
00:49:21.541 --> 00:49:22.542
[Alex] Go. go. jump left!

997
00:49:27.673 --> 00:49:29.049
-No!
-What the hell was that?

998
00:49:29.132 --> 00:49:30.759
-Run!
-Where do we go? Follow me.

999
00:49:35.222 --> 00:49:36.473
[Dariush] Oh. damn!

1000
00:49:37.099 --> 00:49:38.892
Man. we need to get my man Jacobi 
up in here.

1001
00:49:39.267 --> 00:49:40.352
[Gabriel] It's looters.

1002
00:49:42.104 --> 00:49:44.022
[Dariush] All right.
let's find something to eat.

1003
00:49:44.106 --> 00:49:47.150
Man. I need a T-bone steak.
some cheese eggs and Welch's grape.

1004
00:49:49.361 --> 00:49:50.612
I shouldn't have hit you.

1005
00:49:50.946 --> 00:49:51.822
It was my fault.

1006
00:49:52.364 --> 00:49:54.533
I don't know. I'm good. bro. I mean...

1007
00:49:54.825 --> 00:49:57.953
it doesn't hurt as much 
as seeing all this gunk on my new J's.

1008
00:49:58.745 --> 00:50:01.164
How do you care about sneakers 
in a time like this?

1009
00:50:01.915 --> 00:50:03.625
You know what? You guys are lucky.

1010
00:50:04.334 --> 00:50:05.293
You don't have friends.

1011
00:50:05.877 --> 00:50:07.713
It's hard out here for a pimp. 
you know?

1012
00:50:07.796 --> 00:50:10.632
Gotta keep up with the flyest shit.
you know. the dopest kicks.

1013
00:50:10.716 --> 00:50:12.509
Tightest whip. Baddest chick.

1014
00:50:12.592 --> 00:50:15.262
And my friends. they're like bears.
Soon as they smell weakness.

1015
00:50:15.345 --> 00:50:17.264
they're just coming straight at your neck.

1016
00:50:17.639 --> 00:50:20.058
That's why I keep this on my neck.
Diamonds.

1017
00:50:20.142 --> 00:50:22.602
Does Dariush mean "douchebag" in Farsi?

1018
00:50:23.937 --> 00:50:24.813
What's Farsi?

1019
00:50:24.896 --> 00:50:26.440
It's the language your mom was screaming

1020
00:50:26.523 --> 00:50:28.358
-when you were coming out of her ass.
-[giggles]

1021
00:50:28.859 --> 00:50:30.986
Hey. don't talk about my mom's ass.
All right.

1022
00:50:31.069 --> 00:50:32.279
You wish you were there.

1023
00:50:32.362 --> 00:50:34.364
No offense. dude.
those don't sound like friends.

1024
00:50:34.448 --> 00:50:35.323
Yeah...

1025
00:50:35.407 --> 00:50:39.286
[spacecraft approaching]

1026
00:50:41.121 --> 00:50:42.664
[spacecraft departing]

1027
00:50:49.129 --> 00:50:51.298
Hey. how did you even end up in jail?

1028
00:50:56.803 --> 00:50:59.139
My dad left when... when I was about ten.

1029
00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:03.852
You know. I got a job as a bag boy.
at a grocery store my mom worked at.

1030
00:51:04.019 --> 00:51:06.063
To. you know... help her with money.

1031
00:51:07.147 --> 00:51:09.941
One time she steps away.
I took over the cash register.

1032
00:51:14.613 --> 00:51:15.781
I was helping a customer.

1033
00:51:16.364 --> 00:51:19.409
and. uh. he started to accuse me
of stealing from him.

1034
00:51:21.119 --> 00:51:23.163
I guess I gave him the wrong change.

1035
00:51:26.708 --> 00:51:27.793
I get numbers...

1036
00:51:28.168 --> 00:51:30.128
like. muddled in my head sometimes.

1037
00:51:30.462 --> 00:51:32.047
unless I see them written down.

1038
00:51:33.173 --> 00:51:34.424
But he didn't believe me.

1039
00:51:34.758 --> 00:51:35.592
And. um...

1040
00:51:35.675 --> 00:51:36.551
I just...

1041
00:51:38.011 --> 00:51:38.887
I lost it.

1042
00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:40.138
So I decked him.

1043
00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:41.556
Broke his nose.

1044
00:51:43.934 --> 00:51:45.185
Mom got fired and...

1045
00:51:46.394 --> 00:51:47.604
they sent me away.

1046
00:51:48.438 --> 00:51:50.398
She never came around to visit me once.

1047
00:51:53.193 --> 00:51:54.653
You can't choose your family.

1048
00:51:56.113 --> 00:51:57.864
But you can always make a new one.

1049
00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:03.954
Come on.

1050
00:52:04.037 --> 00:52:05.330
A young Yoda up in here?

1051
00:52:05.413 --> 00:52:06.581
[laughing]

1052
00:52:06.665 --> 00:52:09.501
-Come on. guys.
-Oh. we're taking an old school selfie?

1053
00:52:09.876 --> 00:52:11.628
One. two. three.

1054
00:52:11.711 --> 00:52:12.712
[clicks. pops]

1055
00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:15.674
-Dude. stop playing with the Rubik's cube.
-I can't. okay! I can't!

1056
00:52:15.757 --> 00:52:18.301
We can all agree 
that she gets her own bed. right?

1057
00:52:18.385 --> 00:52:20.720
Well. yeah. obviously.
It's the only gentlemanly thing to do.

1058
00:52:20.804 --> 00:52:22.347
It's only right. It sounds like a plan.

1059
00:52:26.268 --> 00:52:27.811
One of you can sleep with me.

1060
00:52:33.316 --> 00:52:34.860
Hold it. Hold it. Wait. wait!

1061
00:52:34.943 --> 00:52:36.820
Did she just say one of us 
could sleep with her?

1062
00:52:36.903 --> 00:52:38.280
-Maybe we misheard her.
-Okay. look.

1063
00:52:38.363 --> 00:52:40.490
I will volunteer my services 
for the good of the group.

1064
00:52:40.574 --> 00:52:42.200
and because I've had the most experience.

1065
00:52:42.284 --> 00:52:43.326
With what? Not getting any?

1066
00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:46.454
Hey. it's better than eating Lithuanian
smoothies from your bunk mate in juvie.

1067
00:52:46.538 --> 00:52:48.331
-Lithuanian smoothies?
-You don't need to know.

1068
00:52:48.415 --> 00:52:50.417
How about we get Alex and Zhenzhen
to sleep together?

1069
00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:52.878
-Because he doesn't want to.
-I wouldn't say I don't want to.

1070
00:52:52.961 --> 00:52:54.713
-They have a connection!
-We do?

1071
00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:56.214
So don't be a cock-block.

1072
00:52:57.132 --> 00:52:59.259
Fine. fine. All right. Okay. cool.

1073
00:52:59.509 --> 00:53:00.719
I won't block your cock.

1074
00:53:01.136 --> 00:53:02.012
Be free.

1075
00:53:03.763 --> 00:53:04.598
Thanks.

1076
00:53:05.056 --> 00:53:06.016
It's no problem.

1077
00:53:09.769 --> 00:53:13.148
Ah. crap! I forgot my sleep apnea mask.
If I snore. I'm sorry.

1078
00:53:13.231 --> 00:53:14.482
You have sleep apnea?

1079
00:53:14.649 --> 00:53:15.734
How old are you?

1080
00:53:15.817 --> 00:53:17.903
It's non-age-discriminate. Gabriel!

1081
00:53:19.446 --> 00:53:20.739
Just move over.

1082
00:53:36.046 --> 00:53:36.963
[clicking]

1083
00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:48.391
I'm glad it was you.

1084
00:54:08.536 --> 00:54:11.414
[Dariush snoring]

1085
00:54:14.751 --> 00:54:16.127
-[loud banging]
-[cat squealing]

1086
00:54:17.337 --> 00:54:18.797
[all panting]

1087
00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:19.923
[clears throat]

1088
00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:22.092
Shh! Shh! Shh! [whispers] Aliens...

1089
00:54:22.175 --> 00:54:23.093
Yeah.

1090
00:54:23.593 --> 00:54:24.552
We gotta go.

1091
00:54:28.932 --> 00:54:29.808
You see anything?

1092
00:54:31.268 --> 00:54:32.102
No. come on.

1093
00:54:32.477 --> 00:54:34.104
[shushing]

1094
00:54:49.119 --> 00:54:50.453
[Alex] Guys. we should turn back.

1095
00:54:50.912 --> 00:54:52.831
We can't now. man. We're already here.

1096
00:54:52.914 --> 00:54:55.583
Dude. I'm telling you. 
this is how people die in movies.

1097
00:55:00.964 --> 00:55:02.966
Guys. You see anything?

1098
00:55:05.176 --> 00:55:07.220
You need some Frebreze on these sheets.

1099
00:55:07.929 --> 00:55:09.180
Ah! Oh! Oh!

1100
00:55:09.889 --> 00:55:10.724
[gun cocks]

1101
00:55:10.807 --> 00:55:12.517
-Oh. shit!
-[all gasping]

1102
00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:14.185
[man] Not another step.

1103
00:55:14.769 --> 00:55:16.104
-Move!
-[Dariush] I'm backing up.

1104
00:55:16.187 --> 00:55:18.982
The hell you doing out here?
We're in the middle of an alien invasion.

1105
00:55:19.065 --> 00:55:21.901
Oh. yeah. I mean. and you're the ones
with the  Purge  masks.

1106
00:55:21.985 --> 00:55:23.862
-Wrong genre. bro.
-[man] We got a comedian here.

1107
00:55:23.945 --> 00:55:25.071
No!

1108
00:55:25.155 --> 00:55:26.406
There are aliens out here. okay?

1109
00:55:26.489 --> 00:55:27.657
We're not the enemy.

1110
00:55:27.741 --> 00:55:29.451
You guys have something we're looking for.

1111
00:55:29.909 --> 00:55:30.827
Dignity?

1112
00:55:32.495 --> 00:55:33.830
What'd you say?

1113
00:55:34.914 --> 00:55:37.250
[man 2] Everybody calm down.

1114
00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:42.297
Look what we found.

1115
00:55:50.847 --> 00:55:51.723
Lou!

1116
00:55:52.349 --> 00:55:54.017
-Oh my God. Lou!
-Thank you. Baby Jesus.

1117
00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:55.560
-Thank you. God!
-Lou.

1118
00:55:55.643 --> 00:55:57.645
-Thank God!
-Hold on. you know this guy?

1119
00:55:57.729 --> 00:55:58.855
[man] No. No. no. no. no.

1120
00:55:58.938 --> 00:56:00.774
Do we know him? Hell. yeah  we know him!

1121
00:56:00.857 --> 00:56:04.277
-Yes! Yes!
-We go way back. Lou. my negro!

1122
00:56:04.361 --> 00:56:06.446
Lou. you know me. We're like this.

1123
00:56:06.529 --> 00:56:09.449
I wanted to free... Alex was the one 
who was like. "Leave him in there."

1124
00:56:09.532 --> 00:56:11.826
and I was like. 
"Dude. let's free him. He's a human."

1125
00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:15.372
Do you mind. if you could just tell 
these handsome men. the ones...

1126
00:56:15.538 --> 00:56:17.832
pointing the shotguns at our face.
to. you know...

1127
00:56:18.208 --> 00:56:20.293
not... not do that?

1128
00:56:21.002 --> 00:56:22.003
-Please?
-Please.

1129
00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:27.384
Please.

1130
00:56:28.468 --> 00:56:30.595
I don't think anyone needs 
to get hurt tonight.

1131
00:56:32.722 --> 00:56:33.556
But Alex...

1132
00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:36.893
if you'd be so kind as to give me that?

1133
00:56:39.479 --> 00:56:40.397
This?

1134
00:56:41.189 --> 00:56:42.023
Yeah.

1135
00:56:43.608 --> 00:56:46.069
This is our only shot
at defeating the aliens.

1136
00:56:46.444 --> 00:56:47.487
Yeah.

1137
00:56:48.696 --> 00:56:51.241
That means someone 
will pay a lot of money for it.

1138
00:56:54.994 --> 00:56:55.954
Give me...

1139
00:56:56.955 --> 00:56:58.039
the key.

1140
00:57:02.377 --> 00:57:03.294
I can't.

1141
00:57:07.132 --> 00:57:08.299
I made a promise.

1142
00:57:08.466 --> 00:57:10.552
Alex. give him the key. Enough. Okay?

1143
00:57:10.718 --> 00:57:12.178
[Lou] You can give me the key

1144
00:57:12.429 --> 00:57:13.721
and just walk away.

1145
00:57:15.682 --> 00:57:18.810
Or I can cut your head off 
and take the key from the stump.

1146
00:57:21.146 --> 00:57:22.355
I trusted you.

1147
00:57:22.856 --> 00:57:25.483
The cemeteries are full of people
who trusted me.

1148
00:57:25.567 --> 00:57:26.443
Oh. shit!

1149
00:57:28.945 --> 00:57:29.946
[man screaming]

1150
00:57:30.029 --> 00:57:31.156
[roaring]

1151
00:57:36.578 --> 00:57:37.996
-[man screaming]
-Oh. sh--

1152
00:57:40.707 --> 00:57:42.083
-Hurry!
-[Alex] Run!

1153
00:57:44.919 --> 00:57:45.795
Come on!

1154
00:57:45.879 --> 00:57:47.255
[creature snarling]

1155
00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:50.425
[shotgun blast]

1156
00:57:52.552 --> 00:57:54.762
[shouting]

1157
00:57:55.555 --> 00:57:56.556
[bones crunching]

1158
00:57:56.681 --> 00:57:59.058
[Lou screaming]

1159
00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:02.020
[boys grunting]

1160
00:58:03.855 --> 00:58:05.565
-Gabriel!
-Gabriel!

1161
00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:07.108
Gabriel. what are you doing?

1162
00:58:07.192 --> 00:58:08.568
Zhenzhen. throw me the glow sticks.

1163
00:58:08.651 --> 00:58:10.195
-What are you doing?
-What are you doing?

1164
00:58:10.278 --> 00:58:11.529
-Gabriel. hurry up!
-Over here.

1165
00:58:11.613 --> 00:58:13.406
-Throw 'em! Come on!
-[Alex] Come here.

1166
00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:16.201
[sticks snapping]

1167
00:58:17.076 --> 00:58:18.161
[Alex] What are you doing?

1168
00:58:18.369 --> 00:58:19.245
Hey!

1169
00:58:19.329 --> 00:58:20.747
[growling]

1170
00:58:22.373 --> 00:58:23.208
Come here!

1171
00:58:23.625 --> 00:58:25.835
-Gabriel. hurry up!
-Come here. you're gonna die!

1172
00:58:25.919 --> 00:58:27.545
-Get over here!
-Hurry!

1173
00:58:27.629 --> 00:58:29.631
[Dariush] Hurry up. Gabriel! Come on!

1174
00:58:29.714 --> 00:58:31.007
Get him. get him. get him!

1175
00:58:32.008 --> 00:58:33.843
-Come on! Come get me!
-Gabriel!

1176
00:58:33.927 --> 00:58:34.761
Gabriel!

1177
00:58:34.886 --> 00:58:36.012
[roaring]

1178
00:58:36.721 --> 00:58:37.847
-Hurry up!
-Gabriel. come on!

1179
00:58:37.931 --> 00:58:38.848
Go! Hurry!

1180
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:40.266
Gabriel. come on!

1181
00:58:47.565 --> 00:58:49.067
[Dariush] Get out. Gabriel!

1182
00:58:55.156 --> 00:58:56.741
Oh. shit. it worked. Gabriel!

1183
00:58:57.075 --> 00:58:58.493
-Oh. my God.
-It worked.

1184
00:58:58.618 --> 00:58:59.494
Go! Go!

1185
00:59:08.461 --> 00:59:10.338
[guns blasting]

1186
00:59:14.342 --> 00:59:17.637
That was the same alien from camp. 
I thought we killed that thing.

1187
00:59:19.138 --> 00:59:20.557
If it came down with the capsule.

1188
00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:22.976
that means it survived the heat 
of atmospheric re-entry

1189
00:59:23.059 --> 00:59:25.812
Which means it must have tremendous 
cellular regeneration abilities.

1190
00:59:25.895 --> 00:59:28.147
English. Alex. please.

1191
00:59:28.523 --> 00:59:29.774
It's like Wolverine.

1192
00:59:29.941 --> 00:59:30.775
Oh.

1193
00:59:31.192 --> 00:59:32.860
Why the hell is the following us?

1194
00:59:32.944 --> 00:59:34.362
It's pissed about its dog.

1195
00:59:34.445 --> 00:59:36.573
You ever watch  Marley and Me 
or  Beethoven?

1196
00:59:36.656 --> 00:59:37.991
It's a primal bond.

1197
00:59:38.116 --> 00:59:39.993
It's out for revenge. Ask John Wick.

1198
00:59:40.076 --> 00:59:42.579
You're putting human motives 
on an alien lifeform.

1199
00:59:42.662 --> 00:59:44.789
No. it probably just had orders 
to kill Collins

1200
00:59:44.872 --> 00:59:47.792
and anyone she came in contact with.
We're just loose ends to this thing.

1201
00:59:47.875 --> 00:59:51.588
-No. you know what. dog theory was better.
-Who gives a frog's fat ass why?

1202
00:59:51.879 --> 00:59:53.256
This ain't Comic-Con. bitches.

1203
00:59:54.591 --> 00:59:57.302
All that matters is that it wants us dead.

1204
00:59:57.802 --> 00:59:59.262
And we can't kill it.

1205
01:00:00.638 --> 01:00:02.682
She's right. We should just keep moving.

1206
01:00:02.974 --> 01:00:04.225
I'm done with your ideas.

1207
01:00:04.809 --> 01:00:07.520
You were the one who thought 
to let Hannibal Lecter out of his cell.

1208
01:00:07.937 --> 01:00:09.939
Consider your leadership privileges...

1209
01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:10.857
revoked!

1210
01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:13.860
Sometimes you do the right thing

01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:35.481
[all] Hey. behind you!

1381
01:10:35.564 --> 01:10:36.398
What?

1382
01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:38.108
I got it.

1383
01:10:38.192 --> 01:10:39.652
-No!
-Dariush. behind you!

1384
01:10:39.735 --> 01:10:40.903
-Turn around!
-No!

1385
01:10:40.986 --> 01:10:42.321
[roaring]

1386
01:10:43.364 --> 01:10:44.782
[groaning]

1387
01:10:51.288 --> 01:10:52.498
We gotta go.

1388
01:10:57.419 --> 01:10:58.462
[Gabriel] Come on. Dariush!

1389
01:10:58.545 --> 01:10:59.380
[Alex] Go. run!

1390
01:10:59.463 --> 01:11:01.382
-[Zhenzhen] Look out!
-[Gabriel] We gotta go!

1391
01:11:04.426 --> 01:11:05.970
Come on. You okay?

1392
01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:08.055
-That cut looks terrible.
-I'm okay. I'm all right.

1393
01:11:08.138 --> 01:11:10.099
Let's just get this key to JPL.

1394
01:11:20.609 --> 01:11:22.820
That was really cool driving back there.

1395
01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:25.447
I couldn't have done that.

1396
01:11:26.532 --> 01:11:28.450
You don't give yourself enough credit.

1397
01:11:30.202 --> 01:11:32.246
I'm told girls find bravery attractive.

1398
01:11:33.038 --> 01:11:34.790
I've never really had much of that.

1399
01:11:40.838 --> 01:11:43.757
[in Mandarin] My whole life
I have been searching for love.

1400
01:11:43.841 --> 01:11:45.467
When I saw you on the bridge...

1401
01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:48.929
I knew you were the one.

1402
01:11:50.055 --> 01:11:52.057
If you feel the same way...

1403
01:11:54.393 --> 01:11:56.645
kiss me now
and we will be together forever.

1404
01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:03.902
[in English] 
I'm sorry. my Mandarin is rudimentary.

1405
01:12:03.986 --> 01:12:04.820
Hmm?

1406
01:12:06.447 --> 01:12:08.407
-What did you say?
-[chuckles softly]

1407
01:12:09.825 --> 01:12:11.577
-[Zhenzhen sighs]
-What did you say?

1408
01:12:12.369 --> 01:12:14.371
Zhenzhen. I don't actually speak Mandarin.

1409
01:12:14.455 --> 01:12:17.166
-What did you say?
-Yo. look! Look. JPL.

1410
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:18.917
-What?
-Whoa!

1411
01:12:19.001 --> 01:12:20.210
-Let's go.
-Come on!

1412
01:12:23.797 --> 01:12:26.383
-Man. this place got hit hard.
-[Dariush] The building is destroyed.

1413
01:12:26.467 --> 01:12:27.676
Nobody can survive that.

1414
01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.928
-[radio beeping Morse code]
-[Zhenzhen] He's still here.

1415
01:12:30.262 --> 01:12:31.930
Dr. Fielding's still here!

1416
01:12:32.556 --> 01:12:33.390
[Alex] This way!

1417
01:12:33.474 --> 01:12:35.142
[Dariush] If we get out of this alive.

1418
01:12:35.225 --> 01:12:36.852
NASA's paying for my therapy.

1419
01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:38.645
Oh. wow.

1420
01:12:38.812 --> 01:12:40.356
They're testing plasma rockets.

1421
01:12:41.106 --> 01:12:43.359
Those things burn hotter 
than the surface of the Sun.

1422
01:12:43.442 --> 01:12:45.444
Look. all we gotta do
is get this key to Dr. Fielding

1423
01:12:45.527 --> 01:12:47.488
then you can look at all 
the nerd porn you want.

1424
01:12:50.532 --> 01:12:52.910
Dr. Fielding! Dr. Fielding!

1425
01:12:53.577 --> 01:12:54.495
We have the key. sir.

1426
01:12:54.578 --> 01:12:55.913
Dr. Fielding. we have the key.

1427
01:12:55.996 --> 01:12:57.623
-Dr. Fielding.
-Dr. Fielding.

1428
01:12:58.415 --> 01:13:00.667
-Dr. Fielding!
-We have the key. sir!

1429
01:13:00.918 --> 01:13:01.919
Over here.

1430
01:13:02.002 --> 01:13:02.836
Guys!

1431
01:13:03.962 --> 01:13:05.672
-Go. go. go!
-Dr. Fielding.

1432
01:13:15.265 --> 01:13:16.225
He's dead. guys.

1433
01:13:19.770 --> 01:13:20.854
[Alex] But how?

1434
01:13:20.938 --> 01:13:22.773

[radio beeping Morse code]

1437
01:13:35.494 --> 01:13:36.412
Shoot!

1438
01:13:36.495 --> 01:13:37.371
We've failed.

1439
01:13:39.665 --> 01:13:40.541
It's over.

1440
01:13:47.881 --> 01:13:48.757
I mean...

1441
01:13:50.968 --> 01:13:52.386
let's be honest. guys.

1442
01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:54.471
Who do we think we are?

1443
01:13:57.349 --> 01:13:58.225
Nerd.

1444
01:13:59.601 --> 01:14:00.436
Criminal.

1445
01:14:01.061 --> 01:14:01.895
Orphan.

1446
01:14:02.729 --> 01:14:03.564
A joke.

1447
01:14:08.068 --> 01:14:09.194
I guess I'll...

1448
01:14:10.154 --> 01:14:11.572
go try and find my parents.

1449
01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:13.949
Me too.

1450
01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:20.038
[sighs]

1451
01:14:34.011 --> 01:14:35.095
What are you doing?

1452
01:14:53.906 --> 01:14:54.823
Look.

1453
01:14:55.532 --> 01:14:57.117
They didn't even get to open this.

1454
01:14:58.118 --> 01:15:01.580
Well. since we're all gonna die together.
may I propose a toast?

1455
01:15:02.623 --> 01:15:05.292
Oh. crap. This is from 1969!

1456
01:15:05.834 --> 01:15:09.296
I mean. could at least get some fresh wine
if this is gonna be my first time. right?

1457
01:15:10.214 --> 01:15:12.216
[bottle clattering]

1458
01:15:12.299 --> 01:15:13.133
[button clicks]

1459
01:15:13.217 --> 01:15:15.135
[general]  Citadel. this is Crystal Palace.

1460
01:15:15.219 --> 01:15:17.221
-What? What was that?
-Go! What the heck?

1461
01:15:17.429 --> 01:15:18.430
Citadel...

1462
01:15:18.514 --> 01:15:20.807
-[Alex] Hello?
-...this is Crystal Palace. Do you copy?

1463
01:15:20.891 --> 01:15:22.351
We're here. over!

1464
01:15:22.434 --> 01:15:24.061
Citadel. identify yourself.

1465
01:15:24.144 --> 01:15:26.396
What is your name. ma'am? Over!

1466
01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:27.564
I'm Alex.

1467
01:15:27.648 --> 01:15:28.649
How old are you?

1468
01:15:28.732 --> 01:15:29.691
I'm thirteen.

1469
01:15:30.108 --> 01:15:32.569
And if you don't mind me asking.
who are we talking to?

1470
01:15:32.694 --> 01:15:35.531
This is General George Khoury 
at Cheyenne Mountain.

1471
01:15:35.906 --> 01:15:37.491
Is anyone alive at JPL?

1472
01:15:37.574 --> 01:15:38.992
Is Dr. Fielding there?

1473
01:15:39.076 --> 01:15:41.370
[Alex] There are four of us. 
everyone else is dead.

1474
01:15:41.453 --> 01:15:43.747
The astronaut sent us. before she died.

1475
01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:45.624
You were sent by Major Collins?

1476
01:15:45.707 --> 01:15:46.792
Yeah. that's why we came.

1477
01:15:46.875 --> 01:15:49.169
She gave us the key 
and said something about Excalibur.

1478
01:15:49.253 --> 01:15:51.421
What. you have the crypto-key
in your possession?

1479
01:15:51.505 --> 01:15:53.882
That's right. What do we need to do 
to get it to work?

1480
01:15:53.966 --> 01:15:55.050
[Khoury sighs]

1481
01:15:55.926 --> 01:15:56.843
Nothing.

1482
01:15:57.386 --> 01:15:58.971
You need to get out of there.

1483
01:15:59.054 --> 01:16:00.597
I'm... I'm sorry. It's over.

1484
01:16:01.932 --> 01:16:04.518
There's nothing you kids 
can do against this thing.

1485
01:16:05.310 --> 01:16:08.397
Now get out of there immediately. 
we're sending two units to pick you--

1486
01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:09.314
No.

1487
01:16:11.316 --> 01:16:13.235
-What did you say. son?
-I said no.

1488
01:16:13.652 --> 01:16:16.280
I made a promise 
I wouldn't let anything stop me.

1489
01:16:16.613 --> 01:16:18.824
So I'm gonna keep trying 
and it will be a lot easier

1490
01:16:18.907 --> 01:16:20.075
if you would help me.

1491
01:16:20.158 --> 01:16:22.202
We didn't come all this way 
to give up now.

1492
01:16:23.036 --> 01:16:25.581
We're done being told 
what we can and can't do.

1493
01:16:25.914 --> 01:16:28.500
We made it across
half of southern California.

1494
01:16:28.584 --> 01:16:30.711
-Past aliens and soldiers.
-[Dariush] A diddler!

1495
01:16:30.794 --> 01:16:32.004
Don't forget about the diddler.

1496
01:16:32.087 --> 01:16:33.255
All the way here.

1497
01:16:33.797 --> 01:16:35.173
Nobody helped us get here.

1498
01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:36.842
All we had was each other.

1499
01:16:37.884 --> 01:16:40.304
So you're gonna listen to me.
because we're not kids anymore.

1500
01:16:40.387 --> 01:16:41.847
and we're the best chance you've got.

1501
01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:45.434
I'm going to ask you
one more time. General.

1502
01:16:45.726 --> 01:16:48.353
What do we need to do 
to get this thing working?

1503
01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:53.650
All right. someone needs to go down 
to the basement and fire up

1504
01:16:53.734 --> 01:16:55.027
the emergency generators.

1505
01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:56.862
Start them in sequence.

1506
01:16:56.945 --> 01:16:59.114
exactly four seconds apart.

1507
01:16:59.197 --> 01:17:00.991
Send your fastest. strongest--

1508
01:17:01.074 --> 01:17:02.117
I'll do it!

1509
01:17:02.659 --> 01:17:05.120
I'm sorry. that sounded like a young girl.

1510
01:17:05.454 --> 01:17:08.206
Oh. yeah!
Aliens don't stand a chance against her.

1511
01:17:08.874 --> 01:17:11.335
All right!
You need to climb through the vent.

1512
01:17:11.418 --> 01:17:15.005
The vault door won't open 
until the power is back on.

1513
01:17:15.088 --> 01:17:16.340
-Got it.
-Look...

1514
01:17:16.965 --> 01:17:18.175
You're not safe at JPL.

1515
01:17:18.717 --> 01:17:20.844
-Did you hear the four seconds part?
-Yeah.

1516
01:17:21.595 --> 01:17:23.722
If this doesn't work.
I need to make sure...

1517
01:17:23.805 --> 01:17:25.390
[Alex] You're gonna need to time it.

1518
01:17:28.226 --> 01:17:29.144
Take care of it.

1519
01:17:31.563 --> 01:17:32.522
And yourself.

1520
01:17:38.236 --> 01:17:39.988
Your father would be proud.

1521
01:17:42.866 --> 01:17:43.784
[kisses]

1522
01:17:49.456 --> 01:17:51.249
What are we doing? What is Excalibur?

1523
01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:54.002
Excalibur was a Cold War defense project.

1524
01:17:54.086 --> 01:17:55.671
It was meant to shoot down

1525
01:17:55.754 --> 01:17:56.797
Russian missiles.

1526
01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:59.675
Yeah. using fusion pumped X-ray lasers.
I read about that.

1527
01:17:59.758 --> 01:18:02.344
Never mind him. He knows everything.
Keep going.

1528
01:18:02.427 --> 01:18:04.596
The key that Major Collins gave you

1529
01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:08.392
contains the coordinates 
of the alien mothership in high orbit.

1530
01:18:09.142 --> 01:18:10.560
We can destroy the mothership.

1531
01:18:11.353 --> 01:18:12.562
You're our last hope.

1532
01:18:14.022 --> 01:18:16.274
Okay. what else do we need to do
to get this shit started?

1533
01:18:16.358 --> 01:18:19.111
You need to realign the satellite dish
on the roof.

1534
01:18:19.194 --> 01:18:20.654
then get a working computer

1535
01:18:20.737 --> 01:18:23.657
and load the coordinates 
Major Collins gave you.

1536
01:18:24.116 --> 01:18:25.784
Then activate Excalibur.

1537
01:18:25.867 --> 01:18:28.036
-All right. I'll go to the roof.
-No. Gabriel.

1538
01:18:30.664 --> 01:18:33.792
You guys load the programs.
I'm gonna go to the roof.

1539
01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:36.920
Plus you're hurt 
and he's the only one keeping you alive.

1540
01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:40.757
What are you talking about? 
You're afraid of heights!

1541
01:18:40.841 --> 01:18:42.467
I'm scared of everything.

1542
01:18:43.427 --> 01:18:44.511
It's my turn.

1543
01:18:46.722 --> 01:18:48.473
Tell Zhenzhen. 
I'm gonna want my watch back.

1544
01:18:52.519 --> 01:18:53.562
And if I die...

1545
01:18:55.272 --> 01:18:56.565
tell her I love her.

1546
01:19:01.194 --> 01:19:04.448
Actually. wait... don't tell her
I love her. just tell her I was into her.

1547
01:19:04.531 --> 01:19:06.408
I don't want to freak her out
with the "L" word.

1548
01:19:06.491 --> 01:19:07.576
Just go!

1549
01:19:10.454 --> 01:19:11.288
