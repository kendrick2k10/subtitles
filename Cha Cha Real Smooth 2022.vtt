Do you think I will ever see you again?

25
00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:05.978
Maybe for a date?

26
00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:10.482

I'm sorry. I'm really nervous.

30
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:21.785
Well. this is the most flatteredI've ever felt.

31
00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:25.372
But…

32
00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:29.751
I'm old.

33
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:41.597
-I actually need that.-I need it.

34
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:55.569

40
00:05:36.253 --> 00:05:39.006
I did. I'm going to kiss you after college

41
00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:41.884
because I've decidedI'm going to Barcelona with you.

42
00:05:41.967 --> 00:05:43.427
That's not funny.

43
00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:46.597
You're super drunk.

44
00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:48.515
No. I'm not.

45
00:05:50.934 --> 00:05:52.060
Okay.

46
00:06:11.038 --> 00:06:12.497

47
00:06:12.581 --> 00:06:14.124

52
00:06:28.222 --> 00:06:30.224
Hey. Maya. This is Andrew.

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:34.978
Hello. Maya. This is Andrew.

54
00:06:35.062 --> 00:06:38.649

56
00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:45.405
Did you ask your brother about tonight?

57
00:06:45.489 --> 00:06:47.115
No. I forgot.

58
00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:48.492
Ask me what?

59
00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:50.869
To take me to a bat mitzvah party.

60
00:06:50.953 --> 00:06:52.454
Well. where is it. little punk?

61
00:06:52.538 --> 00:06:54.039
Space Events in Englewood.

62
00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:55.123
Thank you. little punk.

63
00:06:55.207 --> 00:06:58.001
It's Cath's daughter. Pheeb.Macy's sister.

64
00:06:58.085 --> 00:06:59.837
Cath hates me right now.so I'm not gonna go.

65
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.088
But I sent money.

66
00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:02.256
Is Macy in town?

67
00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:04.007
Yeah. I saw her at the service.

68
00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:05.968
I told her you were here. You should go.

69
00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:07.177
She'd be thrilled.

70
00:07:08.053 --> 00:07:09.763
Would that cramp your style?

71
00:07:09.847 --> 00:07:10.889
-No.-No.

72
00:07:10.973 --> 00:07:12.474
Do you have a crush on Phoebe?

73
00:07:12.558 --> 00:07:13.559
No.

74
00:07:13.642 --> 00:07:15.853
If she looks anything like Macy.you're a fucking liar.

75
00:07:15.936 --> 00:07:18.605
-Language. buddy.-It's fine. Greg. I'm 12.

76
00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:21.191
He doesn't have crushes.He has a girlfriend.

77
00:07:21.275 --> 00:07:22.484
Shut the hell up.

78
00:07:22.568 --> 00:07:23.944
You have a girlfriend?

79
00:07:24.027 --> 00:07:26.780
Girlfriend and puberty?Puberty and a girlfriend?

80
00:07:26.864 --> 00:07:28.615
-Yes.-Margaret.

81
00:07:30.284 --> 00:07:31.285
Mar--

82
00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:33.537
-Fuck off. That is like---No. uh-uh. No. Andrew.

83
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.789
We're not in a Tulane dormitoryright now. okay?

84
00:07:36.373 --> 00:07:39.751
Yes. you're right. Sorry.We're in a 60-year-old's bachelor pad.

85
00:07:39.835 --> 00:07:41.003
No cursing.

86
00:07:41.587 --> 00:07:42.921
I'm just kidding.

87
00:07:43.005 --> 00:07:44.464
Kidding.

88
00:07:45.424 --> 00:07:47.467
My mom did a great job redecorating.

89
00:07:49.011 --> 00:07:50.470
Yeah. She sure did.

90
00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.017
Why does Cath hate you?

91
00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:57.102
I had a moment last week.

92
00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.980
Your mother had a…

93
00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:02.524
manic episode.

94
00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:13.285
Greg. I feel like your purpose on Earthis to make things weird.

95
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:15.871
Do you?

96
00:08:15.954 --> 00:08:17.039
Yeah.

97
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:19.917
All right. Let me take a look at you.

98
00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:22.252
Looking sharp.

99
00:08:24.171 --> 00:08:25.923
Wait. Turn around. Let me see something.

100
00:08:26.715 --> 00:08:28.175
Spank.

101
00:08:28.258 --> 00:08:30.928
I can't believe you're crashingmy little sister's bat mitzvah.

102
00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:32.929
I know. I didn't even go to the service.

103
00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:34.347
I'm here 'cause my mom's skipping.

104
00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:37.183
and David needs a family memberwith him at all times.

105
00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:38.809
-That's not true.-I'm just kidding.

106
00:08:38.894 --> 00:08:40.145
Is your mom okay?

107
00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:43.315
Yes. Yeah.I didn't really hear what happened.

108
00:08:43.899 --> 00:08:44.983
Yeah. neither did I.

109
00:08:45.067 --> 00:08:46.235
I think she's okay.

110
00:08:46.318 --> 00:08:48.487
"Is Cath okay?"is the more important question.

111
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:49.863
Cath is great.

112
00:08:49.947 --> 00:08:52.658
She loves your mom.She loves every mom. really.

113
00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:56.370
Except this one crazy onethat used to sub at Newark.

114
00:08:56.453 --> 00:08:59.748
And apparently. she fucked Mr. Charleboisin the cafeteria bathroom.

115
00:09:00.874 --> 00:09:02.626
Mr. Charlebois our principal?

116
00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:05.629
I forgot you were here. Fuck.I keep forgetting I'm around children.

117
00:09:11.677 --> 00:09:14.596
Pheeb starting off strongwith the innocuous games theme.

118
00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.140
You know. it was going to be"Under the Sea with Pheeb."

119
00:09:17.224 --> 00:09:18.600
but she had to call a last-minute audible

120
00:09:18.684 --> 00:09:21.478
'cause her bitch friend. Gigi Rothman.is obsessed with Little Mermaid.

121
00:09:21.562 --> 00:09:23.063
and she forced her to change it.

122
00:09:23.146 --> 00:09:24.731
-What a bitch.-Bitch.

123
00:09:24.815 --> 00:09:26.441
-Bitch.-Yeah.

124
00:09:26.525 --> 00:09:28.277
Do you have a job now or…

125
00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.196
We're not allowed to talk about jobsat the bat mitzvah party. actually.

126
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.366
Okay. So you either don't have a jobor you have a bad job.

127
00:09:34.449 --> 00:09:36.660
-I have a bad job. Yeah.-Yeah. see?

128
00:09:39.663 --> 00:09:41.039
It's the crazy mom.

129
00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.500
That's the mom I was just talking about.

130
00:09:43.584 --> 00:09:47.713
I am looking at a high schoolerwith her stunning French au pair.

131
00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:50.090
That's a mom and her kid.

132
00:09:50.174 --> 00:09:52.467
So she was. like. a tween mom maybe.

133
00:09:52.551 --> 00:09:54.970
No. that kid's in Davidand Phoebe's grade.

134
00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:58.390
I think she's autistic or something.So. her mom had her start school late.

135
00:09:59.141 --> 00:10:01.435
That's just terrible for both of them.

136
00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:03.270
Cath thinks she smokes crack.

137
00:10:03.353 --> 00:10:04.438
The autistic girl?

138
00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:06.523
Can I have a vodka cranberry. please?

139
00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:09.318
No. actually. can I get a vodka soda?

140
00:10:09.985 --> 00:10:11.403
Actually. no. Vodka cranberry.

141
00:10:15.824 --> 00:10:18.452
Thirteen! Let's do this!

142
00:10:20.579 --> 00:10:21.872
Let's go.

143
00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:26.293
Come on. everybody. There we go.

144
00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:28.378
Come on. Phoebe.That's it. You'll be great.

145
00:10:28.462 --> 00:10:30.172
Getting it started.

146
00:10:34.843 --> 00:10:36.345
Oh. no.

147
00:10:36.428 --> 00:10:39.932
Uh-oh. Here comes Mom. Take cover.

148
00:10:44.186 --> 00:10:46.188
Go. Mom!

149
00:10:48.857 --> 00:10:51.443
Move that thang. Yeah.

150
00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:01.537
Boys. What's going on over here?

151
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.164
Are we not gonna--Are we not gonna dance at some point?

152
00:11:04.248 --> 00:11:07.292
What about you. sir? Don't you havea girlfriend you should be dancing with?

153
00:11:07.376 --> 00:11:08.627
I don't really talk to her.

154
00:11:09.294 --> 00:11:10.671
Great.

155
00:11:10.754 --> 00:11:13.006
What about you. Rod?You seem like a real shot of life.

156
00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:14.675
Why are you not on the floor?Do you not dance?

157
00:11:14.758 --> 00:11:16.677
I can dance. This music just sucks.

158
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.470
I agree with you. I really agree with you.

159
00:11:19.054 --> 00:11:22.224
Is there a songthat would get you dancing?

160
00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:25.102
"Fooly Cooly" by BoyBand.

161
00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:27.312
If I get DJ Rich to play that song.

162
00:11:27.396 --> 00:11:30.023
do you promise that you willdance your freaking butt off?

163
00:11:30.107 --> 00:11:32.609
Yes. That'd be so freaking hype.

164
00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:41.368
Nice work. You want me to beat youin tic-tac-toe?

165
00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:44.204
Or do you wanna mingle a little bit?

166
00:11:45.122 --> 00:11:46.331
You wanna head home?

167
00:11:47.165 --> 00:11:48.500
You're not going to beat me.

168
00:11:48.584 --> 00:11:50.002
I think I'm gonna beat you.

169
00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:52.796
I think I'm gonna kick your cute ass.

170
00:11:53.714 --> 00:11:56.508
Shit! Come on. Play the song. baby!

171
00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:04.308
Do you wanna be X's or O's?

172
00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:05.559
-O's.-X's.

173
00:12:06.602 --> 00:12:07.603
Hi. honey.

174
00:12:08.187 --> 00:12:11.315
-I haven't seen you in such a long time.-I know.

175
00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:12.524
I wish your mom was here.

176
00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:15.152
-I will tell her you said that.-Please do.

177
00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:16.653
Did you get a job yet?

178
00:12:17.404 --> 00:12:20.824
Your daughter asked me the same question.and I don't have a great answer.

179
00:12:20.908 --> 00:12:25.621
But you don't have a party starterhere tonight. so that is my job.

180
00:12:25.704 --> 00:12:26.914
And it'll be free of charge.

181
00:12:26.997 --> 00:12:29.082
We thought DJ Rich would be enough. so…

182
00:12:29.166 --> 00:12:31.877
You were super wrong.'cause he's really bad at his job.

183
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.130
But it's okay because.table four. I have a question.

184
00:12:35.214 --> 00:12:37.466
Do we like the song called "Funky Town"?

185
00:12:40.219 --> 00:12:42.054
We shouldn't go dance. should we?

186
00:12:42.137 --> 00:12:45.474
-We definitely should not do that. Yeah.-Are you sure?

187
00:12:46.058 --> 00:12:49.520
You can put your headphones on.and we can just go in the corner.

188
00:12:49.603 --> 00:12:52.272
Nobody's dancing with their motherwith headphones on.

189
00:12:52.356 --> 00:12:55.359
Hey. Do you two dance?

190
00:12:57.361 --> 00:12:58.570
Sometimes.

191
00:12:59.488 --> 00:13:01.406
But we're not feeling it right now.

192
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.825
So maybe in a bit.

193
00:13:03.909 --> 00:13:05.702
Amazing. Well. yeah. no rush at all.

194
00:13:05.786 --> 00:13:10.082
But. tonight is the night. so…

195
00:13:11.625 --> 00:13:13.001
What night?

196
00:13:13.085 --> 00:13:14.294
Did you say "what night"?

197
00:13:14.378 --> 00:13:16.839
No. I did not. My mother did.

198
00:13:18.006 --> 00:13:19.049
What's your mother's name?

199
00:13:19.132 --> 00:13:20.342
Her name is Domino.

200
00:13:20.425 --> 00:13:21.760
Domino. I'm Andrew.

201
00:13:21.844 --> 00:13:22.970
Hi. Andrew.

202
00:13:23.053 --> 00:13:24.680
Can I ask your name?

203
00:13:24.763 --> 00:13:25.764
Lola.

204
00:13:25.848 --> 00:13:27.224
Your name is Lola?

205
00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:30.477
That's literallymy favorite name of all time.

206
00:13:30.561 --> 00:13:32.771
My mother. Domino. named me.

207
00:13:34.189 --> 00:13:36.817
Well. Domino. to answer your question--

208
00:13:37.776 --> 00:13:38.861
What was your question?

209
00:13:39.778 --> 00:13:43.574
You said. "Tonight's the night."And I said. "What night?"

210
00:13:43.657 --> 00:13:46.577
Tonight is the nightthat you and Lola dance your booties off.

211
00:13:47.661 --> 00:13:50.080
There is no rush at all. No hurry.

212
00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:53.917
Just know that nobody on the dance flooris gonna have nearly as much fun

213
00:13:54.001 --> 00:13:56.503
if you guys aren't there. so…

214
00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:01.175
I don't know how to moonwalk.

215
00:14:21.862 --> 00:14:23.113
Yeah!

216
00:14:27.284 --> 00:14:28.368
Go. Pheeb!

217
00:14:48.305 --> 00:14:49.306
Hey.

218
00:14:50.265 --> 00:14:51.266
Hi.

219
00:14:52.267 --> 00:14:53.310
What are you gonna get?

220
00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.438
I am gonna try to find something

221
00:14:56.522 --> 00:15:00.317
that will give me some courageto ask Lola to slow dance.

222
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.362
That is very sweet. but she won't dance.

223
00:15:04.238 --> 00:15:05.239
It's okay.

224
00:15:07.324 --> 00:15:08.492
Lola's autistic.

225
00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:11.828
That's why she's working on her cubeat the bat mitzvah party.

226
00:15:12.454 --> 00:15:13.997
Not because the party's…

227
00:15:15.541 --> 00:15:17.334
-game-themed. Yes.-Game-themed.

228
00:15:18.961 --> 00:15:20.254
Is that hard?

229
00:15:20.337 --> 00:15:22.047
Yeah. the cu-- It's really hard.

230
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.675
I can't do it for the life of me.but she's really good at it.

231
00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:27.094
-I meant the---I know what you meant.

232
00:15:28.053 --> 00:15:30.055
Nope. I mean. sometimes.

233
00:15:31.139 --> 00:15:32.391
But not because of her.

234
00:15:34.226 --> 00:15:35.227
I'm sorry.

235
00:15:36.061 --> 00:15:38.063
Sometimes I think I'm autistic.

236
00:15:39.815 --> 00:15:40.858
You do?

237
00:15:43.569 --> 00:15:45.112
Well… no.

238
00:15:47.406 --> 00:15:48.907
-That wasn't real.-It happened.

239
00:15:48.991 --> 00:15:50.492
-I'm really sorry.-I'm gonna remember it.

240
00:15:50.576 --> 00:15:53.787
I thinkI could get her on the dance floor.

241
00:15:53.871 --> 00:15:56.039
I will give you $1.000.

242
00:15:56.123 --> 00:15:57.791
Like you'd bet me $1.000?

243
00:15:57.875 --> 00:15:59.459
-No. I'd just give it to you.-No.

244
00:15:59.543 --> 00:16:02.212
Okay. well. that's no fun.How about I bet you--

245
00:16:02.296 --> 00:16:04.590
I'll bet you $300I can get her on the dance floor.

246
00:17:09.445 --> 00:17:10.989
This kid rocks.

247
00:17:11.073 --> 00:17:12.449
He's adorable.

248
00:17:13.575 --> 00:17:15.743
He's even making me not hate Hoochie Slut.

249
00:17:15.827 --> 00:17:17.954
Cathy.that is not even close to appropriate.

250
00:17:18.038 --> 00:17:19.080
She fucked my husband.

251
00:17:19.164 --> 00:17:21.625
-She did not fuck Todd. Why would she?-I can say whatever I want.

252
00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:23.752
It wouldn't have been as much funif you weren't there.

253
00:17:23.836 --> 00:17:25.295
I mean. that's entirely true.

254
00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:27.506
But when I'm not there.just don't be shy. Dance.

255
00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:28.799
You're a really good dancer.

256
00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:31.802
Margaret was so smitten with you.

257
00:17:31.885 --> 00:17:34.930
Girls love good dancers.and the boys do too.

258
00:17:35.514 --> 00:17:36.765
Why do you think I'm gay?

259
00:17:36.849 --> 00:17:39.476
I just think you shouldn't sayfor certain who you are

260
00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.436
until. like. junior year of college.

261
00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.230
What happens junior year?

262
00:17:43.313 --> 00:17:44.731
-Lots of things.-Andrew.

263
00:17:45.649 --> 00:17:47.734
-Hi.-Hey. I thought you guys left.

264
00:17:47.818 --> 00:17:49.862
We wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.

265
00:17:50.487 --> 00:17:51.572
Lola. do you know David?

266
00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:53.907
-Yes.-Hi. Lola.

267
00:17:53.991 --> 00:17:55.450
Hi. David.

268
00:17:56.577 --> 00:17:58.829
We had science class together last year.

269
00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:00.539
God. you guys are cute.

270
00:18:00.622 --> 00:18:05.335
Andrew. Lola and I wanted to saythank you for dancing with us.

271
00:18:05.419 --> 00:18:09.923
And. David. I know I'll probablysee a lot of you at these parties.

272
00:18:10.007 --> 00:18:11.717
But. Andrew. I need your Venmo

273
00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.094
-because I might never see you again.-Right.

274
00:18:14.178 --> 00:18:17.931
Well. I think we have to see Andrew again.

275
00:18:18.682 --> 00:18:20.767
Ladies. what is happening here?

276
00:18:20.851 --> 00:18:22.936
I'm staying in New Jersey for a while.

277
00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:26.523
so I will definitely bring Davidto another bar mitzvah.

278
00:18:26.607 --> 00:18:28.108
Well. I am happy to hear that.

279
00:18:28.192 --> 00:18:31.320
because what's happening right now isyou're being swarmed by Jewish mothers

280
00:18:31.403 --> 00:18:34.156
who are recruiting youto be their motivational dancer.

281
00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:36.033
You mean like the party starters?

282
00:18:36.116 --> 00:18:36.950
-Yes.-Nuh-uh.

283
00:18:37.034 --> 00:18:39.578
They said he made sureeveryone had a perfect night.

284
00:18:39.661 --> 00:18:41.872
And they needa designated party orchestrator.

285
00:18:41.955 --> 00:18:43.498
Andrew. this is so fun.

286
00:18:43.582 --> 00:18:44.833
-You think?-Yes!

287
00:18:44.917 --> 00:18:47.127
I don't know. I wanna hearwhat Greg thinks about it first.

288
00:18:47.211 --> 00:18:48.670
Don't be mean. Stop.

289
00:18:48.754 --> 00:18:51.507
This is so good. You can start a company.

290
00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:53.842
Yeah. I mean.I hate working at Meat Sticks.

291
00:18:53.926 --> 00:18:55.302
and I really enjoyed my night. So…

292
00:18:55.385 --> 00:18:58.222
Well. you wouldn'tquit Meat Sticks altogether.

293
00:18:58.305 --> 00:19:00.015
You'd just cut down on your hours.

294
00:19:00.098 --> 00:19:02.392
Did they mention how much you'd make?

295
00:19:02.476 --> 00:19:05.479
How much does a party starter get paid.I wonder.

296
00:19:05.562 --> 00:19:09.107
I think they said just underwhat an unhappy pharmaceutical exec makes.

297
00:19:09.733 --> 00:19:10.943
What the hell does that mean?

298
00:19:11.026 --> 00:19:12.653
Honey. that's not funny.

299
00:19:19.034 --> 00:19:20.577
Are you thinking about Andrew?

300
00:19:20.661 --> 00:19:21.662
No.

301
00:19:23.705 --> 00:19:27.876
I'm thinking about feeding Jerrycauliflower and cucumber tomorrow.

302
00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.504
Well. big day for you tomorrow. Jerry.

303
00:19:34.925 --> 00:19:37.052
What did Andrew say to get you dancing?

304
00:19:37.135 --> 00:19:40.889
Andrew said he would buy mea MoYu 13-by-13 Magic Cube

305
00:19:40.973 --> 00:19:43.600
with the $300 you were going to give him.

306
00:19:50.482 --> 00:19:52.860
Do you thinkhe would be a good sitter for you?

307
00:19:52.943 --> 00:19:55.779
Well. I do not do well with sitters.

308
00:19:56.613 --> 00:19:59.366
but I think it might be a bit differentwith Andrew.

309
00:19:59.449 --> 00:20:00.701
Why?

310
00:20:00.784 --> 00:20:03.954
I like him.And I think he would like Jerry.

311
00:20:04.913 --> 00:20:07.499
Also. I do not thinkhe would treat me like a baby.

312
00:20:17.259 --> 00:20:19.011
You have to just brush him off.

313
00:20:19.094 --> 00:20:22.014
-I really can't live here.-Can you not talk like that. please?

314
00:20:22.848 --> 00:20:24.141
Greg's a dick. He is.

315
00:20:24.224 --> 00:20:26.185
-Can you not use that language?-That's why I'm out of here

316
00:20:26.268 --> 00:20:27.561
as soon as I have some money.

317
00:20:27.644 --> 00:20:30.230
Stop. What I was gonna say is.Greg's a dick.

318
00:20:30.314 --> 00:20:33.066
but I put up with it becausehe and Mom are good for each other.

319
00:20:34.484 --> 00:20:35.694
Thanks. honey.

320
00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:37.988
Literally how?

321
00:20:42.409 --> 00:20:44.620
Are you happy? Does he make you happy?

322
00:20:44.703 --> 00:20:47.289
I'm happy here. okay?

323
00:20:48.665 --> 00:20:52.211
I don't have to worry aboutso many things because of Greg.

324
00:20:53.003 --> 00:20:55.672
And I don't expect youto understand that yet.

325
00:21:03.931 --> 00:21:06.391
Okay. I'm done talking about Greg.

326
00:21:09.978 --> 00:21:12.105
What's your business going to be called?

327
00:21:12.189 --> 00:21:13.232
Hey.

328
00:21:13.982 --> 00:21:15.150
Tell me.

329
00:21:15.234 --> 00:21:17.444
You're really gonna love it.David came up with it.

330
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:19.071
What?

331
00:21:21.406 --> 00:21:22.616
Jig Conductor.

332
00:21:29.581 --> 00:21:32.793
{\an8}If anybody knows how to start a party.it's my brother. Andrew.

333
00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.672
{\an8}Or should I say. the Jig Conductor?

334
00:21:41.844 --> 00:21:43.303
It stopped.

335
00:21:43.387 --> 00:21:45.138
It broke 'cause it stopped.

336
00:21:45.222 --> 00:21:46.431
That's all there is.

337
00:21:46.515 --> 00:21:48.725
When-- You have to finish it.

338
00:21:48.809 --> 00:21:51.645
Fuck no. Mom. If anybody sees thatI'm gonna get put on a watch list.

339
00:21:51.728 --> 00:21:55.107
It's cute. David is so cute.

340
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.776
What are you talking about?Did you just watch what I watched?

341
00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:59.778
The camera hates him.He's stiff as a board.

342
00:21:59.862 --> 00:22:01.363
So what he's a little stiff?

343
00:22:01.446 --> 00:22:03.991
It's fine. It's so cute. It's so good.

344
00:22:04.074 --> 00:22:08.328
Mom. I don't need to do a video.This thing isn't-- It's not like that.

345
00:22:08.412 --> 00:22:09.621
Like what? Like a job?

346
00:22:09.705 --> 00:22:11.999
Yeah. I get paid.but I don't have to think of it as a job.

347
00:22:12.082 --> 00:22:15.294
Okay. Well. you do have to think of itas a job if you want a job.

348
00:22:15.377 --> 00:22:16.670
I don't want to think of it as a job.

349
00:22:16.753 --> 00:22:19.047
I just want to get enough moneyto go to Barcelona.

350
00:22:22.342 --> 00:22:24.720
Because that's whereMaya is doing her Fulbright?

351
00:22:24.803 --> 00:22:27.890
No. A little. yes.

352
00:22:28.515 --> 00:22:30.767

391
00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:59.935
Hey. buddy. Why'd that girl just leave?

392
00:26:00.018 --> 00:26:01.562
Probably 'cause she's too old.

393
00:26:02.604 --> 00:26:05.983
You feeling a little bit insecureabout her being taller than you?

394
00:26:06.066 --> 00:26:07.734
She's only taller than me'cause she's autistic

395
00:26:07.818 --> 00:26:09.319
and got held back. like. three years.

396
00:26:09.403 --> 00:26:11.488
She's. like. three years older than us.

397
00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:14.700
Were you being mean to her?

398
00:26:14.783 --> 00:26:16.952
You trying to trick her into thinkingshe can't beat you up?

399
00:26:17.828 --> 00:26:18.871
She can't beat me up.

400
00:26:19.788 --> 00:26:21.623
You know who can beat you up for sure?

00:26:21.707 --> 00:26:22.666
What's going on here?

402
00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:25.043

-Do not speak to her like that. Andrew.-You tell her not to--

419

-Okay. you're gonna leave. Let's go.-You embarrassed Rabbi Steinberg.

420
00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:01.330
And you told peopleto dance their wet-ass pussies off.

421
00:27:05.459 --> 00:27:08.921
Hey. where's your mom?Her bag was in there ready to get stolen.

422
00:27:09.004 --> 00:27:10.964
I do not know where my mother is.

424
00:27:14.092 --> 00:27:15.135

00:34:46.295 --> 00:34:49.089
Man. I love Jerry. He is very cute.

529
00:34:49.172 --> 00:34:50.674
Good Lord.

530
00:34:52.134 --> 00:34:54.969
So. school is starting soon.Are you excited?

531
00:34:55.554 --> 00:34:57.181
I'm excited for parts.

532
00:34:57.681 --> 00:34:58.932
You bummed summer is over?

533
00:34:59.016 --> 00:35:00.851
A little bit. yes.

534
00:35:01.518 --> 00:35:04.479
Do you collect potato mashers?

535
00:35:04.563 --> 00:35:05.939
Yes. I do.

536
00:35:06.023 --> 00:35:07.774
That's really awesome.

537
00:35:09.943 --> 00:35:13.822
So. what do you usually dobefore bed besides feed Jer.

538
00:35:13.906 --> 00:35:16.158
and get in pj's and brush your teeth?

539
00:35:16.825 --> 00:35:20.621
My mom sometimes will scratch my back.but I do not want you to do that.

540
00:35:20.704 --> 00:35:23.498
I do not let anybodybut my mother touch my back.

541
00:35:23.582 --> 00:35:25.209
Yeah. No. that makes total sense.

542
00:35:28.212 --> 00:35:29.546
Why are you here?

543
00:35:30.255 --> 00:35:32.549
Ouch. You're trying to hurt my feelings?

544
00:35:33.217 --> 00:35:35.761
-No.-Well. Lola. that was kind of brutal.

545
00:35:35.844 --> 00:35:37.679
I did not mean to be brutal.

546
00:35:39.348 --> 00:35:40.349
I'm just teasing.

547
00:35:42.601 --> 00:35:44.645
Your mom just had a tough night

548
00:35:44.728 --> 00:35:47.523
and I wanted to make sureyou guys were all good.

549
00:35:48.732 --> 00:35:51.610
But I am going to leave right now.

550
00:35:51.693 --> 00:35:56.490
And I'm going to see you at Lexi Ray'sbat mitzvah party. if you're going.

551
00:35:56.573 --> 00:35:58.700
I think I will be in attendance.

552
00:35:58.784 --> 00:36:00.118
Excellent.

553
00:36:00.202 --> 00:36:02.579
Okay. Well. good night.

554
00:36:02.663 --> 00:36:06.625
-Good night to you too. Andrew.-And good night to you too. Jerry.

555
00:36:07.751 --> 00:36:10.045
That's a really cute freaking hamster.

556
00:36:10.546 --> 00:36:11.713
Hello.

557
00:36:13.423 --> 00:36:14.424
Hey.

558
00:36:15.175 --> 00:36:16.385
Hi.

559
00:36:16.468 --> 00:36:18.428
Lola just introduced me to Jerry.

560
00:36:18.512 --> 00:36:20.722
Oh. yeah. She's really proud of him.

561
00:36:21.306 --> 00:36:24.351
Are you hiding something in there?

562
00:36:25.018 --> 00:36:26.103
Yes.

563
00:36:28.105 --> 00:36:29.481
-I'm gonna go and say good night.-Okay.

564
00:36:29.565 --> 00:36:33.235
But if you wanna wait downstairsin the living room. we can talk.

565
00:36:33.819 --> 00:36:34.820
Okay.

566
00:36:35.904 --> 00:36:37.114
I'm glad you're here.

567
00:36:37.197 --> 00:36:38.490
I thought you left.

568
00:36:48.584 --> 00:36:51.170
-Do you have a husband?-I have a fiancé.

569
00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.422
Joseph.

570
00:36:53.505 --> 00:36:54.590
He's in Chicago.

571
00:36:54.673 --> 00:36:57.718
He's not Lola's dad. right?

572
00:36:57.801 --> 00:36:58.802
No.

573
00:36:59.928 --> 00:37:01.138
This is his parents' house.

574
00:37:02.181 --> 00:37:03.182
His parents are here?

575
00:37:04.725 --> 00:37:06.226
He inherited it.

576
00:37:14.943 --> 00:37:17.946
I feel very comfortable with you.I don't know why.

577
00:37:18.655 --> 00:37:19.865
But I do.

578
00:37:21.325 --> 00:37:22.826
Why wouldn't you feel comfortable?

579
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:25.204
Lola said you askedabout her potato mashers.

580
00:37:25.287 --> 00:37:27.122
Your kid is super dope.

581
00:37:27.956 --> 00:37:32.503
And I was thinking. I used to help outfamilies in my neighborhood.

582
00:37:33.086 --> 00:37:36.673
like. if parents wanted a night out.I would stay with their kids.

583
00:37:36.757 --> 00:37:38.550
Or. like. even watch their house.

584
00:37:38.634 --> 00:37:43.931
And I was wondering if. like. you and Lolahave a situation like that with someone.

585
00:37:44.515 --> 00:37:46.517
-Who I need to kill.-No.

586
00:37:47.726 --> 00:37:48.852
No. I wish.

587
00:37:48.936 --> 00:37:51.813
I'd usually just bring herto my parents' house. but…

588
00:37:52.898 --> 00:37:55.567
they live very far away. and it's a pain.

589
00:37:56.068 --> 00:37:58.779
Well. if you don't want to do that ever.

590
00:37:58.862 --> 00:38:03.242
call me because I really like to siton my ass and hang out with people.

591
00:38:04.535 --> 00:38:07.996
But I understand if you don't want to.because we don't really know each other.

592
00:38:09.831 --> 00:38:11.083
We know each other.

593
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:13.502
Yeah. Right?

594
00:38:16.129 --> 00:38:18.382
Do you have a piece of papersomewhere in here?

595
00:38:21.969 --> 00:38:25.430
Okay. My number is on this slip of paper.

596
00:38:25.514 --> 00:38:30.102
and I'm gonna call a rideso you can get some rest.

597
00:38:30.185 --> 00:38:36.817
But I'd really like for you to callor text me if you ever want a night out

598
00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:38.235
or. like. want some help.

599
00:38:40.988 --> 00:38:41.989
Okay.

600
00:38:43.699 --> 00:38:45.659
You wanna sitwhile you wait for your ride?

601
00:38:46.577 --> 00:38:48.245
Yes. On the floor again?

602
00:38:50.038 --> 00:38:51.290
We've upgraded.

603
00:38:52.833 --> 00:38:55.836
I really like your couch.

604
00:38:56.336 --> 00:38:57.546
I hate it.

605
00:38:57.629 --> 00:38:59.756
Me too. That's what I meant to say.

606
00:39:03.969 --> 00:39:05.345
Are you gonna be okay tonight?

607
00:39:05.429 --> 00:39:06.638
Yeah.

608
00:39:13.687 --> 00:39:15.189
It wasn't a period.

609
00:39:17.941 --> 00:39:19.276
I'm so sorry.

610
00:39:22.571 --> 00:39:24.198
That's what I was thinking.

611
00:39:25.282 --> 00:39:27.451
Did Joseph know that you were pregnant?

612
00:39:34.958 --> 00:39:37.586
Let's not tell anybody about this.

613
00:39:37.669 --> 00:39:38.837
Okay.

614
00:39:42.299 --> 00:39:46.595
Well. if you ever want anyone to talk to.I've got massive ears.

615
00:39:48.263 --> 00:39:49.389
Where's your ride?

616
00:39:50.057 --> 00:39:51.183
Oh. my God.

617
00:39:52.017 --> 00:39:54.478
Probably very close.It's about three minutes.

618
00:40:02.653 --> 00:40:04.947
I don't feel like…

619
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:06.031
Okay.

620
00:40:11.703 --> 00:40:14.414
I mean. I want to.But I feel like you don't want to.

621
00:40:19.378 --> 00:40:20.420
It's okay.

622
00:40:42.442 --> 00:40:45.112
Hello. Macy. What are you doing tonight?

623
00:40:48.615 --> 00:40:50.617
-Are you sure nobody's here right now?-Yeah.

624
00:40:50.701 --> 00:40:52.953
Yeah. My parentsare at a bridge tournament.

625
00:40:53.036 --> 00:40:54.830
-My sister's at a sleepover.-Okay.

626
00:40:54.913 --> 00:40:56.790
So. yeah. we can be loud.

627
00:40:56.874 --> 00:40:58.959
Yeah. Go harder. Yeah.

628
00:41:03.338 --> 00:41:05.549
-Why are you staring at me?-I'm not.

629
00:41:05.632 --> 00:41:08.051
-Close your eyes. Why are your eyes open?-My eyes are closed.

630
00:41:08.135 --> 00:41:09.303
They were open.

631
00:41:16.894 --> 00:41:18.645
You can toss that in the bathroom.

632
00:41:39.666 --> 00:41:43.587
Who are you. Mr. Fucker?

633
00:41:44.922 --> 00:41:51.178
The hell are you doingwith my lover. fucker?

634
00:41:56.934 --> 00:41:58.894
I can't believe college is over.

635
00:41:58.977 --> 00:42:00.521
I can't believe we just had sex.

636
00:42:00.604 --> 00:42:03.941
-Why?-I don't know. I just feel old.

637
00:42:04.483 --> 00:42:05.984
Like. I had algebra with you.

638
00:42:06.068 --> 00:42:09.363
And bio. With Dr. Mindle.

639
00:42:09.446 --> 00:42:10.614
Did you have a crush on me?

640
00:42:10.697 --> 00:42:12.491
Everybody had a crush on you.

641
00:42:13.283 --> 00:42:14.368
Yeah. but did you?

642
00:42:15.244 --> 00:42:16.995
I mean. I was attracted to you.

643
00:42:17.079 --> 00:42:22.042
But I feel like-- I think I felt likeyou had so many people.

644
00:42:22.626 --> 00:42:24.002
A lot of suitors.

645
00:42:25.712 --> 00:42:27.005
I wasn't attracted to you.

646
00:42:29.132 --> 00:42:31.426
So I actually didn't ask that.

647
00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:33.387
But I appreciate the honesty.

648
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:35.305
I was attracted to youat my sister's bat mitzvah.

649
00:42:35.389 --> 00:42:36.723
And now you're not?

650
00:42:36.807 --> 00:42:40.686
-Now I'm thinking about algebra.-And bio with Dr. Mindle.

651
00:42:45.274 --> 00:42:46.859
Do you think I peaked already?

652
00:42:49.486 --> 00:42:50.487
No.

653
00:42:52.531 --> 00:42:53.532
Of course not.

654
00:42:53.615 --> 00:42:55.367
I just really hate my job.

655
00:42:56.368 --> 00:42:59.580
If only I could quit my joband be a party starter.

656
00:42:59.663 --> 00:43:01.915
And a Meat Sticks worker.

657
00:43:01.999 --> 00:43:05.002
ButI actually just applied for this job.

658
00:43:05.085 --> 00:43:08.797
It was a--It's a Newark chief officer zone

659
00:43:08.881 --> 00:43:13.468
opportunity analyst intern.

660
00:43:14.261 --> 00:43:17.598
-Cool.-I didn't get it. I got rejected.

661
00:43:18.223 --> 00:43:19.975
Do you think I should quit party starting?

662
00:43:20.058 --> 00:43:22.060
Well. on one hand. it is silly.

663
00:43:22.144 --> 00:43:23.145
It's really silly.

664
00:43:23.228 --> 00:43:25.564
But on the other hand. so is every job.

665
00:43:26.148 --> 00:43:27.649
Like. selling your time is insane.

666
00:43:27.733 --> 00:43:29.735
That's really depressing.

667
00:43:30.444 --> 00:43:32.321
I do think you're a sexy dancer.

668
00:43:34.364 --> 00:43:35.365
No.

669
00:43:36.033 --> 00:43:37.034
Come on.

670
00:43:38.035 --> 00:43:40.037
-Do you wanna have sex again?-Not at all.

671
00:43:42.331 --> 00:43:45.334
No. man.We don't have alcohol. I wish we did.

672
00:43:45.417 --> 00:43:48.545
But no. we don't have our liquor licensehere in the mall.

673
00:43:48.629 --> 00:43:50.255
Hey. How's Margaret?

674
00:43:50.339 --> 00:43:51.882
Are you guys talking yet?

675
00:43:51.965 --> 00:43:55.177
Not really.We just text and dance at bar mitzvahs.

676
00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:56.345
Yeah. you do.

677
00:43:56.428 --> 00:43:59.473
Your chemistry with heron the dance floor is pretty insane.

678
00:44:00.682 --> 00:44:01.892
Are you just saying that?

679
00:44:01.975 --> 00:44:05.145
I'm saying that 'cause I have two eyes.You guys are electric together.

680
00:44:05.938 --> 00:44:07.481
When did you have your first kiss?

681
00:44:10.067 --> 00:44:11.068
Why do you ask?

682
00:44:11.151 --> 00:44:13.695
Margaret's friend told methat she wants to kiss.

683
00:44:13.779 --> 00:44:14.905
Uh-oh.

684
00:44:15.614 --> 00:44:17.407
And how do we feel about that?

685
00:44:17.491 --> 00:44:19.326
Answer with your badass shades off.

686
00:44:21.537 --> 00:44:23.080
I don't know how to make it happen.

687
00:44:25.249 --> 00:44:27.876
All right. Lesson one.

688
00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:31.213
Forty percent of it is instinct.

689
00:44:31.296 --> 00:44:34.132
Like. if it feels right.it probably is right.

690
00:44:34.216 --> 00:44:35.801
Go with your gut.

691
00:44:35.884 --> 00:44:38.971
And then 10% is your brainand all that stuff.

692
00:44:39.054 --> 00:44:41.014
Like game plan. strategy.

693
00:44:41.098 --> 00:44:44.309
And then 50% is Margaret.

694
00:44:45.435 --> 00:44:47.271
You don't know anything about her.

695
00:44:47.354 --> 00:44:49.731
You don't know what she wantsor what she likes.

696
00:44:49.815 --> 00:44:52.693
so you have to talk to her.

697
00:44:53.819 --> 00:44:55.195
Try super hard to know.

698
00:44:55.779 --> 00:44:56.947
Are there any more lessons?

699
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:58.031
Yes. there are.

700
00:44:58.115 --> 00:45:02.995
There are five-- four lessonson how to have the best first smooch.

701
00:45:13.547 --> 00:45:15.632
Hey. do you see a lot of Lola at school?

702
00:45:15.716 --> 00:45:18.218
Yeah. I have English with her this year.Why?

703
00:45:18.302 --> 00:45:21.263
I don't know. I just think you guys shouldbe really nice to her. Bullies suck.

704
00:45:21.346 --> 00:45:24.433
And I feel like it'd do a lotif cute boys were really nice to her.

705

706
00:45:27.561 --> 00:45:29.062

707
00:45:29.146 --> 00:45:31.899
-Yeah.-Well. maybe you guys should beat him up.

Oh. God.

721
00:46:31.124 --> 00:46:32.543
I'm not a push-up guy.

722
00:46:36.129 --> 00:46:37.548
I'm not a sit-up guy either.

723
00:46:39.883 --> 00:46:41.426
Why do you want this job?

724
00:46:42.928 --> 00:46:47.307
Well. hope loves a friend.

725
00:46:48.976 --> 00:46:52.229
Hope Loves a Friendis the name of our nonprofit. yeah.

726
00:46:52.312 --> 00:46:55.566
But why do you wanna join the teamas a communications associate?

727
00:46:55.649 --> 00:46:56.900
Yeah. sorry.

728
00:46:57.484 --> 00:47:00.320
I studied marketing at Tulane.

729
00:47:00.404 --> 00:47:05.826
And I have a lot of experiencewith social media design.

730
00:47:06.994 --> 00:47:10.497
And a lot of experience withCRM tools like Buffer and MailChimp.

731
00:47:10.581 --> 00:47:11.582
A lot of experience there.

732
00:47:12.791 --> 00:47:13.667
And…

733
00:47:15.252 --> 00:47:18.463
I don't know.I just wanna help make a difference

734
00:47:18.547 --> 00:47:22.759
with kids and young adultswhose parents are affected with ASL.

735
00:47:22.843 --> 00:47:25.179
You mean ALS.

736
00:47:30.017 --> 00:47:32.227
Pretty sure it's ASL.

737
00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:36.857
No. I'm kidding. Obviously. you're right.

738
00:47:41.111 --> 00:47:43.405
My dad has ALS.

739
00:47:45.616 --> 00:47:47.409
That's not true.I don't know why I just said that.

740
00:47:54.583 --> 00:47:56.543
-Hey.-Hey.

741
00:47:57.127 --> 00:47:58.337
How'd the interview go?

742
00:47:59.171 --> 00:48:04.218
I'm going to lean back into theMeat-Sticks. party-starting grind.

743
00:48:04.301 --> 00:48:06.053
Can you tell me the second lesson?

744
00:48:06.136 --> 00:48:07.721
The second lesson is…

745
00:48:07.804 --> 00:48:10.682
give her all of your attentionbecause that's all people want.

746
00:48:10.766 --> 00:48:12.017
That's pretty easy.

747
00:48:13.727 --> 00:48:15.270
Does that look good? Yes? That--

748
00:48:15.354 --> 00:48:17.189
-King. You're a king.-For the kids' side?

749
00:48:17.272 --> 00:48:18.899
That's for the kids' side.then I'll lead the adults.

750
00:48:18.982 --> 00:48:21.527
Maybe we do a call and responsetype of thing. So it's--

751
00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:22.986
What if I was like…

752
00:48:24.071 --> 00:48:25.906
Your turn. Or something like that?

753
00:48:27.157 --> 00:48:32.287
Yes. Clap. clap. Yes!And then maybe you can invite. like--

754
00:48:32.371 --> 00:48:35.582
Like. invite one of your friends upto do a dance or something like that.

755
00:48:35.666 --> 00:48:36.750
Like Carter.

763
00:48:53.183 --> 00:48:56.228
I was. like. looking at the class list.And then I was like.

764
00:48:56.311 --> 00:49:00.858
"I'm not gonna be like. 'Hey.can you tell your son I lost his number?'"

765
00:49:01.859 --> 00:49:03.443
-So…-Where's Lola?

766
00:49:03.527 --> 00:49:06.488

770
00:49:14.746 --> 00:49:17.040
But. yeah. I did. I wanted to warn you.

00:49:17.124 --> 00:49:18.959

00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:02.085
All of his cases are in Chicago.

00:50:02.169 --> 00:50:04.463
I think we should move there.We're thinking about it.

789
00:50:04.546 --> 00:50:06.381
She wants to. I'd rather not.

790
00:50:07.424 --> 00:50:08.675

00:50:44.461 --> 00:50:45.546
Yes.

797
00:50:45.629 --> 00:50:47.714
I'm so sorry. I just had to--

798
00:50:47.798 --> 00:50:51.093
Well. no. I'd love to. though.I haven't changed my mind.

799
00:50:52.261 --> 00:50:54.930
Okay. Well. I just thought that maybe…

800
00:50:56.682 --> 00:50:58.016
What?

801
00:50:58.100 --> 00:51:01.353
Nothing.I have a birthday party next week.

802
00:51:01.436 --> 00:51:04.898
that I would like to go to.but Joseph will be out of town.

803
00:51:04.982 --> 00:51:07.067
-I'm there. I'm absolutely there.-So…

804
00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:08.944
If Lola wants.

805
00:51:09.027 --> 00:51:11.280
Yeah. Of course. she does.She really likes you.

806
00:51:11.363 --> 00:51:12.781
I really like her.

807
00:51:17.744 --> 00:51:19.872
-I cannot see.-That's the point.

808
00:51:24.001 --> 00:51:26.211
How are you so fast at this game?

809
00:51:26.295 --> 00:51:28.046
A lot of practice.

810
00:51:29.214 --> 00:51:30.215
Yes.

811
00:51:30.299 --> 00:51:32.342
What is happening? What are you doing?

812
00:51:32.968 --> 00:51:34.386
No. we are not done.

813
00:51:34.469 --> 00:51:36.471
No! No!

814
00:51:38.098 --> 00:51:41.977
What is "farctate"? What is "farctate"?That is not a word. "Farctate"?

815
00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:43.395
It is a word.

816
00:51:43.478 --> 00:51:45.647
Well. use it in a sentence.

817
00:51:46.315 --> 00:51:49.401
It's a farctate board nowthat I've put those letters down.

818
00:51:49.484 --> 00:51:53.947
What. a fucked-up board?Like farctate-- Like you farted on it?

819
00:51:54.031 --> 00:51:58.035
No. It is filled.Farctate means to fill or stuff.

820
00:51:58.118 --> 00:52:00.287
It means full. as opposed to hollow.

821
00:52:00.370 --> 00:52:01.997
I don't believe you at all.

822
00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:07.961
And I'm going to provethat you are telling the truth.

823
00:52:08.045 --> 00:52:09.129
That is a word.

824
00:52:09.213 --> 00:52:12.049
I don't understand how you're so goodat this game.

825
00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:15.886
I'm not that good.I am just a lot better than you.

826
00:52:15.969 --> 00:52:16.970
Wow.

827
00:52:17.054 --> 00:52:20.182
Did you feed Jerry and brush your teeth?

828
00:52:20.265 --> 00:52:22.476
-Yes. of course.-Duh.

829
00:52:22.559 --> 00:52:26.647
Well. I'm sorry Mom isn't hereto scratch your back.

830
00:52:27.314 --> 00:52:30.984
Is there-- Can I. like.read you a story or something?

831
00:52:31.068 --> 00:52:34.738
Or. like. I can fall asleep on the floorwhile you fall asleep.

832
00:52:34.821 --> 00:52:36.949
I used to need my mom to read me a story.

833
00:52:37.032 --> 00:52:40.911
Then after that. she had to. like. sleepnext to me in order for me to fall asleep.

834
00:52:40.994 --> 00:52:44.623
I do not like that sort of thing.I do not mean to be brutal.

835
00:52:44.706 --> 00:52:46.875
No. No. no. It's not.

836
00:52:46.959 --> 00:52:49.336
I just wanna make sureyou're okay to fall asleep.

837
00:52:49.419 --> 00:52:51.213
I'm okay to fall asleep.

838
00:52:51.713 --> 00:52:52.714
Okay.

839
00:52:54.341 --> 00:52:55.384
Well. good night.

840
00:52:55.467 --> 00:52:56.802
Good night to you too. Andrew.

841
00:52:56.885 --> 00:52:58.887
And good night to you too. Jerry.

842
00:52:58.971 --> 00:53:00.556
Is mine blue?

843
00:53:01.139 --> 00:53:02.808
Yeah. it's super blue.

844
00:53:03.684 --> 00:53:04.768
How did that happen?

845
00:53:04.852 --> 00:53:05.978
Just normal.

846
00:53:07.229 --> 00:53:08.897
Do you want to know something?

847
00:53:09.481 --> 00:53:10.482
Yes.

848
00:53:10.983 --> 00:53:13.902
I'm having more fun nowthan I did the whole night.

849
00:53:15.028 --> 00:53:16.363
Did you have a bad night?

850
00:53:17.948 --> 00:53:19.324
No. it wasn't bad.

851
00:53:21.702 --> 00:53:23.120
Yeah. it was bad.

852
00:53:25.914 --> 00:53:27.374
I'm a bad person.

853
00:53:30.252 --> 00:53:31.962
I don't think you're a bad person.

854
00:53:35.966 --> 00:53:37.134
Let's trade.

855
00:53:37.968 --> 00:53:38.969
What?

856
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:41.471
Okay.

857
00:53:51.899 --> 00:53:52.983
I have a question.

858
00:53:53.817 --> 00:53:55.861
-Have you ever been depressed?-Wow.

859
00:53:56.862 --> 00:53:57.863
Downer alert.

860
00:53:57.946 --> 00:54:01.241
You don't have to sound the downer alert.

861
00:54:01.325 --> 00:54:02.826
I'm just curious.

862
00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:04.286
I've always been depressed.

863
00:54:05.537 --> 00:54:06.622
Downer alert.

864
00:54:09.458 --> 00:54:10.876
Before Lola was born?

865
00:54:12.002 --> 00:54:13.837
Especially before Lola was born.

866
00:54:15.506 --> 00:54:17.299
Raising her made me better.

867
00:54:23.555 --> 00:54:25.265
What's it like being depressed?

868
00:54:27.059 --> 00:54:28.143
I don't know.

869
00:54:31.355 --> 00:54:32.856
It feels like…

870
00:54:34.441 --> 00:54:37.486
like you don't rememberwhat better feels like.

871
00:54:38.487 --> 00:54:43.534
And then you do things that you thinkwill make you feel better. but they don't.

872
00:54:43.617 --> 00:54:45.118
They make it worse.

873
00:54:47.162 --> 00:54:49.581
And the thingsthat I'm really scared of doing

874
00:54:49.665 --> 00:54:53.335
are probably the thingsthat will help me the most.

875
00:54:53.418 --> 00:54:55.671
but I just can't do them.

876
00:55:01.677 --> 00:55:03.679
My mom is bipolar…

877
00:55:04.847 --> 00:55:07.266
so she was really depressed a lotwhen I was a kid.

878
00:55:07.349 --> 00:55:10.644
And. I one time asked herthe same question

879
00:55:10.727 --> 00:55:13.730
and she said. "Sometimes it's just easierfor people to be sad."

880
00:55:15.107 --> 00:55:17.526
She tries though. Like. really tries.

881
00:55:19.945 --> 00:55:21.488
Everybody tries.

882
00:55:23.282 --> 00:55:27.327
I understand that depressionmakes your brain think things aren't true.

883
00:55:28.036 --> 00:55:33.709
but sometimes I just wish peoplelike my mom would listen to. like.

884
00:55:33.792 --> 00:55:35.961
people instead of her brain.

885
00:55:36.545 --> 00:55:38.755
And. like. good people. not shitty people.

886
00:55:42.676 --> 00:55:44.678
Do you know what you look like right now?

887
00:55:45.679 --> 00:55:46.680
No.

888
00:55:47.389 --> 00:55:50.058
You look like the sweetest person ever.

889
00:55:51.310 --> 00:55:54.563
-Do you know what you look like right now?-I don't want to know-- I don't care.

890
00:55:54.646 --> 00:55:56.106
I don't want to know.

891
00:55:57.316 --> 00:56:00.652
Everything feels so good right now.I don't want it to change.

892
00:56:01.570 --> 00:56:04.239
The only thing I would changeis that my elbows hurt.

893
00:56:04.323 --> 00:56:05.365
Your elbows hurt?

894
00:56:05.449 --> 00:56:07.868
Yeah. from leaning on them like that.

895
00:56:12.998 --> 00:56:14.041
Wow.

896
00:57:01.004 --> 00:57:02.256
Holy crap.

897
00:57:12.266 --> 00:57:14.268
I thought you were gonna be Greg.

898
00:57:14.810 --> 00:57:15.978
What?

899
00:57:16.061 --> 00:57:19.106
Hey.David doesn't like this cereal. does--

900
00:57:19.189 --> 00:57:20.399
Nope. just you.

901
00:57:24.069 --> 00:57:26.738
-Thank you.-You're welcome. What'd you do tonight?

902
00:57:28.073 --> 00:57:30.284
I was out with some high school friends.

903
00:57:33.287 --> 00:57:35.622
Are you planningfor your Spanish adventure?

904
00:57:35.706 --> 00:57:37.749
Because I am ready to help.

905
00:57:40.377 --> 00:57:44.673
I think Maya is dating someonein Barcelona.

906
00:57:52.806 --> 00:57:55.309
I didn't want to say this before.

907
00:57:55.392 --> 00:57:58.520
and I'm not just saying thisbecause I'm your mother.

908
00:57:58.604 --> 00:58:01.899
but you're way too good for herand everybody knows that.

909
00:58:02.691 --> 00:58:05.319
Literally everyone I know thinks that.

910
00:58:05.944 --> 00:58:06.987
Who?

911
00:58:07.070 --> 00:58:08.739
Everyone. Greg--

912
00:58:13.452 --> 00:58:16.205
-It's true though.-Greg told you that Maya was too good--

913
00:58:18.916 --> 00:58:22.085
It's true. We all know it's true.

914
00:58:22.169 --> 00:58:23.879
Fulbright scholar is--

915
00:58:23.962 --> 00:58:26.048
-Big dummies.-Dummies.

916
00:58:32.721 --> 00:58:34.598
Yes. I'm way too good for her.

917
00:58:36.808 --> 00:58:39.561
Your memories aren't going anywhere.by the way.

918
00:58:48.487 --> 00:58:51.156
I'm sorry. Growing up is hard.

919
00:58:52.783 --> 00:58:55.494
It's very overwhelming.I don't know how much I have left.

920
00:58:55.577 --> 00:58:56.662
I have so much. right?

921
00:58:58.121 --> 00:59:01.542
Not-- You know. not necessarily.

922
00:59:01.625 --> 00:59:02.626
You…

923
00:59:04.002 --> 00:59:06.713
You did a lot when you were young.

924
00:59:09.633 --> 00:59:10.676
Sorry.

925
00:59:11.969 --> 00:59:15.472
But I feel like you're wayahead of the game.

926
01:00:14.948 --> 01:00:16.450
Hi. Andrew.

927
01:00:16.533 --> 01:00:17.534
Hey.

928
01:00:18.327 --> 01:00:22.581
Guys. was it extra beautiful today?

929
01:00:22.664 --> 01:00:24.374
We were just talking about that.

930
01:00:24.458 --> 01:00:27.002
Yeah. sometimes I really envy Judaism.

931
01:00:27.085 --> 01:00:28.086
Same.

932
01:00:28.170 --> 01:00:30.672
And Nicky and his familywere so sweet. Don't you think?

933
01:00:30.756 --> 01:00:33.842
Yes. The parents. Oh. my God.They were literally to die for.

934
01:00:34.718 --> 01:00:37.387
Hey. will you sit for Lolathis week so I can take Domino out?

935
01:00:37.471 --> 01:00:40.891
Yes. Lo and I get to fricking party again?

936
01:00:40.974 --> 01:00:46.396
Well. I have four fourswhich puts me at. like. 195.

937
01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:49.775
I tried so hard to beat you.What is your secret?

938
01:00:49.858 --> 01:00:52.319
-I do not have any secrets.-Do you promise?

939
01:00:52.402 --> 01:00:54.112
-Yes.-Okay.

940
01:00:54.196 --> 01:00:58.992
Well.Lola kicks Andrew's ass one more time.

941
01:01:01.954 --> 01:01:04.289
What do you want to do now. party animal?

942
01:01:06.333 --> 01:01:08.126
I am not exactly sure.

943
01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:10.921
-Do you want some more food?-No. thank you.

944
01:01:15.717 --> 01:01:17.761
Do you like spending timewith me like this?

945
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:20.973
I feel like it's taking a lot out of you.

946
01:01:21.056 --> 01:01:24.560
but I want you to know thatI can just sit here and. like. not talk.

947
01:01:25.269 --> 01:01:28.814
I can chill. I can be a chiller.I feel like I'm talking a lot.

948
01:01:31.316 --> 01:01:34.444
Sometimes it drains me a bit mentallyand physically

949
01:01:34.528 --> 01:01:36.697
when I spend a lot of time mingling.

950
01:01:37.531 --> 01:01:38.615
Okay. yeah.

951
01:01:39.741 --> 01:01:41.451
I'm sorry that I'm draining.

952
01:01:41.535 --> 01:01:43.537
How can I not be? How can I help that?

953
01:01:44.162 --> 01:01:46.790
You're probably not going to be able to.

954
01:01:48.208 --> 01:01:51.211
Sometimes I just needto recover in solitude.

955
01:01:51.712 --> 01:01:54.298
I actually enjoy being in an empty room.

956
01:01:56.383 --> 01:01:58.093
Well. I'm very jealous of that.

957
01:01:59.344 --> 01:02:00.762
Why are you jealous?

958
01:02:03.348 --> 01:02:06.685
Because I wish I enjoyed the companyof an empty room.

959
01:02:07.811 --> 01:02:09.855
Have you ever tried to enjoy it?

960
01:02:13.025 --> 01:02:15.694
"Have you ever tried to enjoy it?" No.

961
01:02:42.054 --> 01:02:45.432
I'm ready for bed and I do not mindyou scratching my back.

962
01:02:47.809 --> 01:02:50.103
I'm going to do my best Domino impression.

963
01:02:50.187 --> 01:02:51.730
Go like this.

964
01:02:52.814 --> 01:02:54.316
And go like that.

965
01:02:55.067 --> 01:02:56.443
-Like this?-Yeah.

966
01:02:56.527 --> 01:02:57.528
Okay.

967
01:02:58.153 --> 01:02:59.738
And go across.

968
01:02:59.821 --> 01:03:00.822
Like. across your back?

969
01:03:01.365 --> 01:03:02.366
Okay.

970
01:03:05.661 --> 01:03:07.579
-More pressure. please.-Okay.

971
01:03:39.653 --> 01:03:41.238
You're trash. kid.

972
01:03:47.411 --> 01:03:48.412
Hey.

973
01:03:49.538 --> 01:03:50.539
Fun night?

974
01:03:50.622 --> 01:03:51.915
Yep.

975
01:03:51.999 --> 01:03:55.669
Dinner and a movie and a… long ride home.

976
01:03:57.754 --> 01:03:59.715
We were just talking about you.

977
01:03:59.798 --> 01:04:02.634
Was saying to Domino that you.remind me of myself.

978
01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:04.553
That's interesting.

979
01:04:07.139 --> 01:04:09.016
-How?-How was Lola tonight?

980
01:04:09.099 --> 01:04:12.728
She's great. She was great.We played 500 Rummy.

981
01:04:12.811 --> 01:04:13.812
I love that game.

982
01:04:13.896 --> 01:04:15.189
Where are your socks. man?

983
01:04:18.609 --> 01:04:20.527
I… took them off.

984
01:04:20.611 --> 01:04:23.989
They're in my shoesbecause it was getting hot in here.

985
01:04:26.658 --> 01:04:28.160
It is really hot in here.

986
01:04:28.243 --> 01:04:31.538
Yeah. it was really hot at.like. 20 minutes ago. especially.

987
01:04:32.164 --> 01:04:33.707
Is that your shirt?

988
01:04:33.790 --> 01:04:36.376
-It is. actually. yeah.-Class of 2018?

989
01:04:38.587 --> 01:04:39.713
How old are you?

990
01:04:41.798 --> 01:04:43.675
I'm 22.

991
01:04:45.010 --> 01:04:47.554
I don't even remember being 22.

992
01:04:47.638 --> 01:04:49.473
I didn't realize you were that old.

993
01:04:52.351 --> 01:04:54.144
Lots to figure out after college.

994
01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:58.732
Yeah. lots to figure out. always.

995
01:04:58.815 --> 01:05:00.943
Want to help us figure out our stuff?

996
01:05:01.527 --> 01:05:02.528
I'm sorry?

997
01:05:02.611 --> 01:05:05.447
We've both had too much to drink.Andrew. I'm sorry.

998
01:05:05.531 --> 01:05:07.407
We're going to go to bed.

999
01:05:07.491 --> 01:05:10.577
Yeah. no worries at all. I'll leave you.

1000
01:05:10.661 --> 01:05:13.580
-I still got to pay you for sitting.-No. it's fine. You can Venmo me.

1001
01:05:13.664 --> 01:05:16.250
No. I got cash.

01:05:16.333 --> 01:05:17.376
Thank you.

1003
01:05:18.752 --> 01:05:20.045
Good night. Domino.

1004
01:05:26.051 --> 01:05:27.553
What's the third lesson?

1005
01:05:27.636 --> 01:05:30.097
Be somewhere alone with her.

1006
01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:32.599
Quiet. Other people around is bad news.

1007
01:05:32.683 --> 01:05:35.185
So. say "Let's go somewhere quiet"?

1008
01:05:35.269 --> 01:05:36.937
Where the fuck is my Meat Stick vest?

1009
01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:39.273
-Don't you have multiple?-Yes. But one's in the hamper.

1010
01:05:39.356 --> 01:05:41.608
I don't want to go to workwith a smelly-ass vest on.

1011
01:05:41.692 --> 01:05:42.985
Can you help me for a second?

1012
01:05:43.068 --> 01:05:45.320
It's somewhere in this room.Check my drawers or something.

1013
01:05:50.784 --> 01:05:53.912
You should just. like. ask her to goto the water fountain with you.

1014
01:05:53.996 --> 01:05:56.290
That's where I had my first kiss.You can. like--

1015
01:05:56.373 --> 01:05:58.417
Or you could just not say anything.grab her hand

1016
01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:00.377
and start walking with herand she'll be like.

1017
01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:02.629
"Oh. my God. Are we aboutto have our first kiss right now?"

1018
01:06:02.713 --> 01:06:06.466
-Won't that be creepy?-Yes. No. not if you pull it off.

1019
01:06:06.550 --> 01:06:07.968
I don't think I can.

1020
01:06:08.051 --> 01:06:11.805
Well. you won't with that attitude. David.Where is my Meat Stick vest?

01:09:31.671 --> 01:09:32.673
Have one.

1045
01:09:33.423 --> 01:09:34.841

1056
01:10:09.001 --> 01:10:10.377
I know what a tilde is.

1057
01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:12.754
I know how to soft step.

1058
01:10:13.255 --> 01:10:16.758
I just don't want to right now.I want to hear why you're getting married.

1059
01:10:19.303 --> 01:10:21.096
Because I want commitment.

1060
01:10:22.472 --> 01:10:24.016
It doesn't seem like that.

1061
01:10:24.892 --> 01:10:26.143
I know.

1062
01:10:28.687 --> 01:10:33.400
But I want to be firmly plantedin adult world.

1063
01:10:34.443 --> 01:10:39.656
And I want to--I want everything else to be shut down.

1064
01:10:40.532 --> 01:10:42.201
And I want to build something.

1065
01:10:43.535 --> 01:10:44.953
Is he your soul mate?

1066
01:10:46.038 --> 01:10:49.041
-Do you believe in soul mates?-Yeah. I do.

1067
01:10:51.668 --> 01:10:55.631
I think. on the Earth. we all have.like. a ton of soul mates.

1068
01:10:57.049 --> 01:11:00.385
I think for you. maybe it's likea special case where you only have a few…

1069
01:11:02.221 --> 01:11:05.390
who. like. could beand really are your soul mates.

1070
01:11:08.352 --> 01:11:10.687
But most of the peoplein the world aren't your soul mate.

1071
01:11:10.771 --> 01:11:12.564
How many soul mates?

1072
01:11:12.648 --> 01:11:14.608
For you. like. four.

1073
01:11:14.691 --> 01:11:15.734
Four?

1074
01:11:15.817 --> 01:11:18.529
-Yeah. Four soul mates.-I probably haven't met any of them.

1075
01:11:18.612 --> 01:11:22.199
No. you have. God puts them. like.on your path so you'll cross.

1076
01:11:22.282 --> 01:11:23.283
How many do you have?

1077
01:11:23.992 --> 01:11:25.285
Like. 1.200.

1078
01:11:27.829 --> 01:11:28.830
Have you met any?

1079
01:11:28.914 --> 01:11:30.165
Yes.

1080
01:11:34.670 --> 01:11:35.963
Domino.

1081
01:11:39.091 --> 01:11:40.884
Oh. my God. That's a ton of blood.

1082
01:11:43.887 --> 01:11:45.556
Why do you want to go to Chicago?

1083
01:11:48.475 --> 01:11:51.270
Because I want change and…

1084
01:11:53.856 --> 01:11:59.570
I think I want to go to college andthere are a lot more options in Chicago.

1085
01:12:01.113 --> 01:12:04.449
And I just feel likemy whole life is happening there.

1086
01:12:05.117 --> 01:12:08.161
-You should definitely go to college.-I knew you would say that.

1087
01:12:08.245 --> 01:12:10.581
But you should go hereso Lola and I can hang out

1088
01:12:10.664 --> 01:12:13.542
when you're busy studyingand doing your essays.

1089
01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:20.674
I had this dream the other nightthat I was working on the common app.

1090
01:12:21.758 --> 01:12:26.388
And Lola was there. and I couldn't focus.

1091
01:12:26.471 --> 01:12:29.725
And then you came in and you were like.

1092
01:12:29.808 --> 01:12:32.436
"Are you ready to turn it in?"And I just…

1093
01:12:34.271 --> 01:12:35.272
freaked out.

1094
01:12:35.355 --> 01:12:38.358
I was freaking outbecause I hadn't even started it.

1095
01:12:40.068 --> 01:12:41.278
And then you were like…

1096
01:12:43.739 --> 01:12:46.408
"It's okay. You have plenty of time.''

1097
01:12:48.952 --> 01:12:50.913
And I had side-swept bangs.

1098
01:12:54.833 --> 01:12:58.504
Did the side-swept bangs suck?Is that why you're tearing up right now?

1099
01:13:05.719 --> 01:13:08.138
Do you know I was married to Lola's dad?

1100
01:13:09.348 --> 01:13:10.349
No.

1101
01:13:15.938 --> 01:13:17.147
He left.

1102
01:13:23.362 --> 01:13:26.406
I want to thank youfor being so kind to Lola.

1103
01:13:30.911 --> 01:13:32.412
Easiest thing in the world.

1104
01:13:37.292 --> 01:13:39.336
I want you to be in Lola's life.

1105
01:13:41.797 --> 01:13:44.633
But I don't want youto babysit for us anymore.

1106
01:13:49.388 --> 01:13:50.389
Why?

1107
01:13:52.599 --> 01:13:54.768
Because I want you to do your 20s.

1108
01:14:05.904 --> 01:14:09.449
I feel like there are thingsthat you just. like. don't say to me.

1109
01:14:12.536 --> 01:14:18.959
And I can't tell whether you're. like.holding back a desire to be close

1110
01:14:19.042 --> 01:14:21.587
or a desire to be distant.

1111
01:14:25.966 --> 01:14:28.594
For me.it's holding back a desire to be close.

1112
01:15:07.674 --> 01:15:08.717
Oh. my God.

1113
01:15:09.885 --> 01:15:12.304
You have to go.And you have to go out that door.

1114
01:15:12.387 --> 01:15:13.680
Oh. fuck. he said tomorrow.

1115
01:15:13.764 --> 01:15:15.682
-Domino. look at me for a second.-No.

1116
01:15:25.275 --> 01:15:26.568
It's just me.

1117
01:15:43.335 --> 01:15:44.336
Hey.

1118
01:15:50.342 --> 01:15:51.593
How are your friends?

1119
01:15:57.391 --> 01:15:59.393
I'm kissing Margs tomorrow.

1120
01:16:01.854 --> 01:16:03.981
-Andrew?-That's great. That's awesome.

1121
01:16:06.191 --> 01:16:08.735
Can you tell me the other lessons?

1122
01:16:08.819 --> 01:16:10.737
No. Not right now.

1123
01:16:11.446 --> 01:16:12.698
What?

1124
01:16:12.781 --> 01:16:13.615
Why?

1125
01:16:13.699 --> 01:16:15.784
Because I don't have any lessons.

1126
01:16:15.868 --> 01:16:18.829
Every time you asked me for a lesson.I just pulled something out of my ass.

1127
01:16:18.912 --> 01:16:20.789
And I don't want to do that right now.

1128
01:16:21.623 --> 01:16:25.961
Wait. So you've been messing with me?

1129
01:16:26.044 --> 01:16:29.214
David. can you please fuck off right now?I don't want to talk.

1130
01:16:29.298 --> 01:16:31.884
I don't have any lessons.I don't know shit.

1131
01:16:37.139 --> 01:16:39.725
I guess I don't knowwhy I thought you know shit.

1132
01:16:39.808 --> 01:16:41.560
You don't even have a girlfriend.

1133
01:16:42.102 --> 01:16:45.397
You want to get your ass kickedright now? Is that why you said that?

1134
01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:47.941
-That's not funny.-I'm not trying to be funny.

1135
01:16:48.650 --> 01:16:50.402
You're not the only one who can be mean.

1136
01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:54.865
You're not mean. David.You're just really fucking annoying.

1137
01:17:25.979 --> 01:17:27.022
Hi. Andrew.

1138
01:17:27.105 --> 01:17:28.941
What's up. chiller? Hey. Joseph.

1139
01:17:29.024 --> 01:17:30.359
Hey.

1140
01:17:31.401 --> 01:17:33.278
Hey. can you hold another thing right now?

1141
01:17:33.904 --> 01:17:36.156
It depends on what that thing is.

1142
01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:38.033
All right. Wait right there. Hold on.

1143
01:17:38.116 --> 01:17:39.326
What is it?

1144
01:17:39.409 --> 01:17:40.661
It is…

1145
01:17:42.496 --> 01:17:45.165
You know. just a MoYu 13-by-13.

1146
01:17:45.249 --> 01:17:47.668
It's for you. it's yours.

1147
01:17:48.627 --> 01:17:50.629
Thank you very much for this.

1148
01:17:51.129 --> 01:17:53.048
You sure you can hold it? Yes. you can.

1149
01:17:53.131 --> 01:17:55.509
That's really kind of you. Andrew.

1150
01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:58.929
Hey. Lola. why don't yougo sit at that table over there

1151
01:17:59.012 --> 01:18:01.515
and claim our territorybefore everybody gets here.

1152
01:18:05.310 --> 01:18:07.688
Listen. we haven't told Lola yet.

1153
01:18:07.771 --> 01:18:10.065
but we're not gonna need youto babysit anymore.

1154
01:18:10.899 --> 01:18:11.900
Why?

1155
01:18:12.651 --> 01:18:14.194
Lots of reasons.

1156
01:18:15.070 --> 01:18:17.197
One of them being I finished my trial.

1157
01:18:17.281 --> 01:18:18.532
We settled.

1158
01:18:18.615 --> 01:18:19.616
Congratulations.

1159
01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:22.661
Yeah. So. I'm actually gonnabe taking some time off.

1160
01:18:22.744 --> 01:18:25.372
We won't need a sitter anymore.

1161
01:18:27.875 --> 01:18:29.376
Where's Domino right now?

1162
01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:30.961
She's at home.

1163
01:18:33.630 --> 01:18:34.756
Is she okay?

1164
01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:37.467
Yeah. she just didn't feel like comingto a party tonight.

1165
01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:41.430
Why are you so fucking vague. man?

1166
01:18:41.513 --> 01:18:44.224
-What?-Is she. like. sick or what?

1167
01:18:44.308 --> 01:18:48.353
Look. Mr. Schindler's looking over herelike he wants you to get back to your job.

1168
01:18:48.437 --> 01:18:51.857
I'm going to let you do that.I'm gonna go sit with Lola.

1169
01:18:56.278 --> 01:19:00.532
Could you do me a solid?Could you pour me. like. a straight water?

1170
01:19:00.616 --> 01:19:02.326
And by water I mean vodka.

1171
01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:10.876
Stepdad Greg.

1172
01:19:10.959 --> 01:19:14.671
Hey. I just showed upwith your mom and brother.

1173
01:19:16.256 --> 01:19:18.258
Well.I didn't think you were showing up alone

1174
01:19:18.342 --> 01:19:20.469
to Benjamin Schindler's bar mitzvah party.

1175
01:19:20.552 --> 01:19:24.264
I hear we're driving you homebecause you Ubered. Is that right?

1176
01:19:24.348 --> 01:19:26.058
That's right. Yes.

1177
01:19:26.141 --> 01:19:30.145
Although I feel like allthat Uber money might be worth it

1178
01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:32.731
to not smell that fish in your car.

1179
01:19:34.316 --> 01:19:36.318
-What fish?-I have no idea.

1180
01:19:36.401 --> 01:19:39.488
I assumed you had many fish in your car.

1181
01:19:39.571 --> 01:19:43.033
-Did you put fish in my car?-No. man. your car just reeks.

1182
01:19:44.284 --> 01:19:45.327
All right. Andrew.

1183
01:19:46.078 --> 01:19:49.248
Have a nice nightmaking certain people feel happy.

1184
01:19:49.331 --> 01:19:51.458
Have a nice night hating your life.

1185

Everybody's nervous.You got it. I got to go.

You ready for some music? All right.

1205
01:20:49.892 --> 01:20:52.895
I know how hard it is for some of youto get on the dance floor.

1206
01:20:52.978 --> 01:20:54.521
but the way we're going to start tonight

1207
01:20:54.605 --> 01:20:57.774
is everybody is gonna dothe Cha Cha Slide.

1208

Every single person. No exceptions.

1209
01:21:01.695 --> 01:21:03.322
I'm literally not going to start the song

1210
01:21:03.405 --> 01:21:06.158
until every single person ison the dance floor.

1211

Damn.

1245
01:23:17.581 --> 01:23:21.251
Andrew. there are boundariesthat come with a professional gig.

1246
01:23:21.335 --> 01:23:23.545
Every profession has those boundaries.

1247
01:23:24.171 --> 01:23:27.966
Okay. but the way you putthat man to sleep. stepdad Greg.

1248
01:23:28.050 --> 01:23:29.718
Andrew. this isn't funny.

1249
01:23:29.801 --> 01:23:31.470
Mom. I'm sorry that you got slugged.

1250
01:23:31.553 --> 01:23:34.890
but those kids that Rodrigoand David were fighting are pricks.

1251
01:23:34.973 --> 01:23:37.351
Every kid in their gradeis going to sleep very well tonight.

1252
01:23:37.434 --> 01:23:40.395
knowing they got their asses kicked.Along with that prick dad.

1253
01:23:40.479 --> 01:23:42.523
-Now they won't fuck with people.-The language.

1254
01:23:42.606 --> 01:23:44.608
Yeah. It was worth it. Mom and Greg.

1255
01:23:44.691 --> 01:23:47.611
Yeah. I've been waitingto kick their asses for three years now.

1256
01:23:47.694 --> 01:23:48.737
Unbelievable.

1257
01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:51.532
And. Greg. that was the meanest right hookI've ever seen. my boy.

1258
01:23:51.615 --> 01:23:54.243
Yeah. Greg.I did not know you could move like that.

1259
01:23:54.326 --> 01:23:56.119
What are you. Jake Paul?

1260
01:24:01.208 --> 01:24:05.045
I knew you would like that one. dog.He literally fell asleep.

1261
01:24:07.172 --> 01:24:09.007
Well. no one hits your mother.

1262
01:24:17.599 --> 01:24:19.101
Mom. it's not on the table.

1263
01:24:19.184 --> 01:24:21.311
-Did you look in my bag?-Yes. it's not there.

1264
01:24:21.395 --> 01:24:23.230
I don't know.Maybe it's on my bedside table.

1265
01:24:23.313 --> 01:24:24.314
Okay.

1266
01:24:24.398 --> 01:24:26.692
Look. I really don't want youto drive right now.

1267
01:24:26.775 --> 01:24:29.695
-Greg. I had one drink.-Where are you going?

1268
01:24:29.778 --> 01:24:31.822
I'm going to my friend's housebecause she's sick

1269
01:24:31.905 --> 01:24:34.157
-and I want to go check on her.-Why are you in such a hurry?

1270
01:24:34.241 --> 01:24:36.952
I'm not in a hurry. You need toput ice on that. It looks horrible.

1271
01:24:37.035 --> 01:24:38.495
David. can you come upstairs with me?

1272
01:24:38.579 --> 01:24:41.415
And. you guys. ice your fists.

1273
01:24:41.498 --> 01:24:42.916
'Cause of your punches.

1274
01:24:43.542 --> 01:24:45.169
-Yes. sir.-Yes. sir.

1275
01:24:45.252 --> 01:24:46.670
David. come up here.

1276
01:24:50.382 --> 01:24:53.343
I'm really sorry.I was having a bad 24 hours.

1277
01:24:54.970 --> 01:24:58.098
-It's okay.-It's not okay. but I'm really sorry.

1278
01:25:00.267 --> 01:25:02.728
-Did you have your first kiss tonight?-No.

1279
01:25:02.811 --> 01:25:04.104
You didn't? That's good.

1280
01:25:04.188 --> 01:25:07.191
That's actually really. really goodbecause I realized something.

1281
01:25:08.025 --> 01:25:10.027
My lessons sucked.

1282
01:25:10.110 --> 01:25:11.612
They were. like. super misleading.

1283
01:25:11.695 --> 01:25:13.822
I kept telling youthat it was all about Margaret

1284
01:25:13.906 --> 01:25:15.908
and about. like.giving her all your attention.

1285
01:25:16.867 --> 01:25:19.828
but I forgot to say that you haveto pay attention to yourself too.

1286
01:25:21.038 --> 01:25:24.249
It's not easy. like we were saying.It's actually really hard.

1287
01:25:25.459 --> 01:25:27.878
Because you've got to gofor what you want. too.

1288
01:25:29.129 --> 01:25:30.881
Kissing is for two people to enjoy.

1289
01:25:34.134 --> 01:25:35.219
I got to go.

1290
01:25:36.970 --> 01:25:39.556
Really awesome shit tonight.

1291
01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:41.808
I'm so proud to be your big brother.

1292
01:25:43.227 --> 01:25:44.436
Love you.

1293
01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:46.396
-Andrew?-Yes. What?

1294
01:25:48.690 --> 01:25:49.691
Good luck.

1295
01:25:50.692 --> 01:25:51.693
Thank you.

1296
01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:05.582
Hey.

1297
01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.877
-Hi.-Hi.

1298
01:26:10.128 --> 01:26:11.171
Are you sick?

1299
01:26:11.255 --> 01:26:13.423
No. I just didn't want to go to the party.

1300
01:26:13.507 --> 01:26:16.009
What are you-- It's not over.

1301
01:26:16.093 --> 01:26:17.177
It's not.

1302
01:26:17.261 --> 01:26:19.388
I just wanted to comeand tell you something

1303
01:26:19.471 --> 01:26:22.432
'cause I feel like I'm not goingto get another chance to tell you…

1304
01:26:23.141 --> 01:26:26.770
that I feel likeyou don't want to get married.

1305
01:26:26.854 --> 01:26:28.355
So. I don't think that you should.

1306
01:26:30.524 --> 01:26:31.733
And I love you.

1307
01:26:33.110 --> 01:26:35.320
-You don't love me.-Yeah. I do.

1308
01:26:38.991 --> 01:26:41.451
And more than anything.I just want you to be happy.

1309
01:26:45.622 --> 01:26:46.832
I am happy.

1310
01:26:51.503 --> 01:26:55.591
When I'm with you. I feel so… alive.

1311
01:26:55.674 --> 01:26:57.426
and I feel so special.

1312
01:26:59.136 --> 01:27:00.512
But that's because it's all…

1313
01:27:03.098 --> 01:27:04.349
possibility.

1314
01:27:07.311 --> 01:27:09.146
We're not in a relationship.

1315
01:27:09.229 --> 01:27:12.024
-But what if we were in a relationship?-I don't know.

1316
01:27:14.610 --> 01:27:19.072
And I don't want to knowbecause you are 22.

1317
01:27:20.032 --> 01:27:22.534
and you deserve so much more than this.

1318
01:27:22.618 --> 01:27:24.912
You can't just decidethat you love somebody.

1319
01:27:24.995 --> 01:27:27.080
and then that's that.and everything's great.

1320
01:27:27.164 --> 01:27:28.790
-Yes. you can.-No. you can't.

1321
01:27:28.874 --> 01:27:31.710
Yes. you can. You can.

1322
01:27:36.173 --> 01:27:38.550
You don't even know who you are yet.

1323
01:27:40.511 --> 01:27:42.846
Giving your heart to somebody is…

1324
01:27:44.223 --> 01:27:45.849
the scariest.

1325
01:27:46.683 --> 01:27:47.976
most dangerous.

1326
01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:52.314
most perplexing thing.

1327
01:27:53.690 --> 01:27:56.026
What if we just kiss?Maybe you'll change your mind.

1328
01:27:59.863 --> 01:28:00.864
No.

1329
01:28:04.159 --> 01:28:06.161
I want to marry him.

1330
01:28:07.663 --> 01:28:09.581
I do. I really want to marry him.

1331
01:28:09.665 --> 01:28:15.462
and I know that it doesn't seem like thatbecause of what I do. but I want that.

1332
01:28:15.546 --> 01:28:17.840
It's just that I'm so scared…

1333
01:28:20.384 --> 01:28:21.969
because the first one left.

1334
01:28:22.052 --> 01:28:23.053
He left me.

1335
01:28:29.351 --> 01:28:32.604
Marrying Joseph is the thingthat will help you the most.

1336
01:28:32.688 --> 01:28:34.022
What?

1337
01:28:34.106 --> 01:28:37.776
The other night you said that the thingsthat really scare you are the things

1338
01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:39.611
that are gonna help you the most.

1339
01:28:39.695 --> 01:28:41.488
I had thought that you were--

1340
01:28:43.115 --> 01:28:45.200
I thought that you were talking about me.

1341
01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:49.621
Because I'm an idiot.

1342
01:29:24.281 --> 01:29:25.449
I'm really sorry.

1343
01:29:25.532 --> 01:29:27.034
Roll the window down.

1344
01:29:30.370 --> 01:29:32.956
I'm really sorry. man. I'm a dumb kid.

1345
01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:35.709
I know. It's okay.

1346
01:29:39.463 --> 01:29:41.423
Thanks for looking out for Lola tonight.

1347
01:29:43.342 --> 01:29:44.927
Andrew. look at me for a second.

1348
01:29:46.303 --> 01:29:47.971
Thanks for looking out for my family.

1349
01:29:49.473 --> 01:29:51.391
-You good to drive?-Yeah.

1350
01:30:10.035 --> 01:30:11.745
I'm drunk. now.

1351
01:30:32.933 --> 01:30:38.230
Mom. can you pick me upin Greg's car right now?

1352
01:30:40.399 --> 01:30:44.611
Yeah. I'm safe.Everything is just. like. a mess.

1353
01:31:09.928 --> 01:31:11.680
-Hi.-Andrew. this is Ashlin.

1354
01:31:11.763 --> 01:31:15.142
I've heard so many things about you.I hear you're a…

1355
01:32:16.119 --> 01:32:17.871
-Hello?-Hey. it's me.

1356
01:32:19.081 --> 01:32:22.417
I got off early. Can I get David?

1357
01:32:23.043 --> 01:32:24.253
Yeah.

1358
01:32:24.336 --> 01:32:26.088
-Are your keys in here?-Yeah.

1359
01:32:28.549 --> 01:32:29.550
Mother.

1360
01:32:30.175 --> 01:32:31.969
Can I tell you something?

1361
01:32:35.597 --> 01:32:37.724
I'm really sorry I gave youthat black eye.

1362
01:32:37.808 --> 01:32:40.686
is the first thing I wanted to say.It looks really cool. though.

1363
01:32:42.062 --> 01:32:43.772
And I also want to tell you

1364
01:32:43.856 --> 01:32:46.608
that I have decidedI'm not going to Barcelona.

1365
01:32:49.319 --> 01:32:51.613
But I do think I'm gonna move out soon.

1366
01:32:53.323 --> 01:32:54.950
I realize I have enough money.

1367
01:32:56.618 --> 01:32:58.537
But I don't thinkI'm going to move very far.

1368
01:33:02.499 --> 01:33:04.084
That sounds great. babe.

1369
01:33:08.839 --> 01:33:11.967
I've been passing our old houseon the way to work.

1370
01:33:12.050 --> 01:33:13.510
Like. I walk by it every day.

1371
01:33:14.303 --> 01:33:16.180
-You have?-Yes.

1372
01:33:18.056 --> 01:33:20.893
And I feel really happyevery time I pass it.

1373
01:33:23.228 --> 01:33:25.147
And I just want you to know that.

1374
01:33:28.442 --> 01:33:31.778
Like. I have this urge to tell youthat I had a really great childhood.

1375
01:33:32.362 --> 01:33:34.907
And I think you're a really great mother.

1376
01:33:34.990 --> 01:33:37.159
I hope you know that. I think that.

1377
01:33:41.330 --> 01:33:43.582
And I also really love your new house.

1378
01:33:43.665 --> 01:33:45.834
And I'm really happy that you're happy.

1379
01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:49.713
Are you trying to kill me?

1380
01:33:53.967 --> 01:33:55.010
Yes.

1381
01:34:19.493 --> 01:34:20.702
Yeah. Come here.

1382
01:34:38.804 --> 01:34:39.930
-Hey.-Hi.

1383
01:34:41.807 --> 01:34:44.685
For some reason. I was afraidI was never going to see you again.

1384
01:34:44.768 --> 01:34:49.439
Well. I usually don't pick up David.But today I got off work early. so…

1385
01:34:57.281 --> 01:35:00.117
You really caught meoff guard the other night.

1386
01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:03.745
I just didn't have a chance to thinkabout what I wanted to say to you.

1387
01:35:05.956 --> 01:35:08.959
It's not justthat I'm afraid of commitment

1388
01:35:09.042 --> 01:35:10.794
because I've been left before.

1389
01:35:11.753 --> 01:35:13.881
It's becauseyou're deeply in love with me?

1390
01:35:14.631 --> 01:35:15.632
Yeah.

1391
01:35:18.886 --> 01:35:21.597
But what I was gonna say is that…

1392
01:35:22.681 --> 01:35:25.017
it is really hard for me

1393
01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:29.938
to accept the fact thatuntil I leave Earth.

1394
01:35:30.981 --> 01:35:35.986
I'm gonna have always been so tangled.

1395
01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:42.576
She came when I was so young.

1396
01:35:43.410 --> 01:35:44.411
And…

1397
01:35:47.122 --> 01:35:52.169
then everything from therewas defined by her stages.

1398
01:35:53.587 --> 01:35:57.257
And then Joseph came along.and I'm so thankful. but…

1399
01:35:58.717 --> 01:36:02.804
for the rest of my life.everything is going to be defined by them.

1400
01:36:05.265 --> 01:36:06.475
But you.

1401
01:36:08.310 --> 01:36:09.811
you only have you.

1402
01:36:10.979 --> 01:36:14.983
And how scary but how amazing.

1403
01:36:16.401 --> 01:36:19.196
You can just figure things out.

1404
01:36:19.279 --> 01:36:22.658
and you don't have to worryabout bringing another person into it.

1405
01:36:25.327 --> 01:36:29.957
Yeah. I think you're so great.

1406
01:36:32.417 --> 01:36:34.253
I'm really sorry that--

1407
01:36:34.336 --> 01:36:35.587
It's okay.

1408
01:36:46.473 --> 01:36:48.809
-Well. dang. this sucks.-What does?

1409
01:36:48.892 --> 01:36:51.228
You just gave me. like.your farewell speech.

1410
01:36:51.311 --> 01:36:52.896
So this means we're saying goodbye.

1411
01:37:13.458 --> 01:37:14.751
I should go.

1412
01:37:14.835 --> 01:37:17.379
David doesn't think that I'm parking.

1413
01:37:17.462 --> 01:37:19.548
so I should get in the carpool line.

1414
01:37:21.216 --> 01:37:22.509
And I don't want to see Lola.

1415
01:37:22.593 --> 01:37:25.637
I realized the other dayI probably won't see her much anymore.

1416
01:37:25.721 --> 01:37:27.723
and that makes a lot of sense to me.

1417
01:37:28.765 --> 01:37:30.726
Yeah. but that makes me really sad.

1418
01:37:30.809 --> 01:37:32.186
Yeah. it makes me--

1419
01:37:34.521 --> 01:37:36.190
makes me really sad too.

1420
01:37:36.273 --> 01:37:37.858
Gosh. you're really sweet.

1421
01:37:37.941 --> 01:37:40.194
No. I'm not. I just really love you guys.

1422
01:37:42.946 --> 01:37:45.032
But my memories aren't going anywhere.

1423
01:37:46.783 --> 01:37:47.993
Neither will mine.

1424
01:37:50.537 --> 01:37:51.997
Neither will hers.

1425
01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.418
Okay. well.

1426
01:37:58.253 --> 01:37:59.254
Bye.

1427
01:38:05.969 --> 01:38:07.387
-Wait. Hold on.-Yes?

1428
01:38:07.471 --> 01:38:12.893
I was gonna tryand get you this card.

1429
01:38:12.976 --> 01:38:15.270
I was going to mail it and then…

1430
01:38:17.231 --> 01:38:19.149
-I don't have---You don't have my address.

1431
01:38:19.233 --> 01:38:21.485
No.I don't really know anything about you.

1432
01:38:22.653 --> 01:38:23.737
But you can have it.

1433
01:38:23.820 --> 01:38:25.072
Thank you.

1434
01:38:28.325 --> 01:38:30.494
By the way. I do think I'm a soul mate.

1435
01:38:32.246 --> 01:38:34.164
But I know that Joseph is too.

1436
01:39:56.371 --> 01:39:57.831
Do you want to talk about it?

1437
01:39:59.541 --> 01:40:03.128
No. not right now. Maybe later.Thank you for asking.

1438
01:40:04.379 --> 01:40:06.548
Well. I'm--I'll probably end up doing homework

1439
01:40:06.632 --> 01:40:09.885
at the dining room table.so whenever you're ready.

1440
01:40:13.597 --> 01:40:16.016
David. I want to be friends forever. okay?

1441
01:40:16.725 --> 01:40:17.726
Okay.

1442
01:40:19.228 --> 01:40:21.438
Can I tell you something sad. though?

1443
01:40:21.522 --> 01:40:24.816
I think I'm not going to be livingin your room much longer.

1444
01:40:24.900 --> 01:40:28.237
I think it's probably timeI find my own place. right?

1445
01:40:29.363 --> 01:40:33.367
Yeah. I mean. that's probably right.It's a pretty tight space.

1446
01:40:33.867 --> 01:40:36.578
Yes. it is a very tight space.

1447
01:40:38.872 --> 01:40:40.707
Did you talk to Margaret today?

1448
01:40:42.876 --> 01:40:45.879
Yeah. We did some talking.

1449
01:40:49.550 --> 01:40:53.303
What? Shut your ass up right now!Did you have your first kiss today?

1450
01:40:54.930 --> 01:40:58.559
You had your first kiss today.What are you talking about right now?

1451
01:40:58.642 --> 01:41:00.894
At school? Oh. my God.

1452
01:41:00.978 --> 01:41:03.438
Okay. so we're-- You're--We're getting home right now.

1453
01:41:03.522 --> 01:41:06.108
You're going to do your homeworkso freaking fast.

1454
01:41:06.191 --> 01:41:08.694
and then you're going to tell meevery single solitary detail.

1455
01:41:08.777 --> 01:41:10.904
And then we're going to breakinto Greg's secret fridge

1456
01:41:10.988 --> 01:41:12.531
and pop some bottles before he gets home.

1457
01:41:45.272 --> 01:41:46.481
Why do you look upset?

1458
01:41:47.274 --> 01:41:48.483
Why do you look upset?

1459
01:41:50.777 --> 01:41:51.778
What's going on?

1460
01:41:55.824 --> 01:41:58.994
I think I'm a little heartbroken too.

1461
01:41:59.077 --> 01:42:01.747
What? Margaret?

1462
01:42:02.497 --> 01:42:03.665
No. no. It's…

1463
01:42:05.083 --> 01:42:06.668
I'm going to miss you.

1464
01:42:20.557 --> 01:42:22.434
I'm gonna miss you too. man.
