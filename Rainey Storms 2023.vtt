3
00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.698
(tense music)

4
00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:45.420
(tense music intensifies)

5
00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:13.615
(tense music continues)

6
00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:40.350
(tense music)

7
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.474
- Look. lemme get
back to you. okay?

8
00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:25.854
And as I've said. I give no
low budget family discounts.

9
00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:27.856
This is not project law.

10
00:02:27.897 --> 00:02:30.859
You know what? I'll call
you when I find wasted time.

11
00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:35.196
Yeah. uh-huh.

12
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.242
There's an unexpected species

13
00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:41.703
that just walked into
my office unannounced.

14
00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:46.416
I know you saw me on
an important call.

15
00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:51.171
but I forgot you don't have
proper training. do you.

16
00:02:51.212 --> 00:02:55.175
but other than the floor
under my daddy's desk?

17
00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:59.346
What is it. Trudy? And
where's my espresso?

18
00:03:00.388 --> 00:03:02.390
- Good morning to you too.

19
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.227
Looks like someone woke up
on the wrong side of the bed.

20
00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.690
And did you just call
me a species? Really?

21
00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:13.651
- Like I said. what
do you need. Trudy?

22
00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:15.362
If I knew you were
gonna treat my place

23
00:03:15.403 --> 00:03:17.447
like that ghetto
hair salon you ran.

24
00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.782
I would've hired a temp.

25
00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:22.327
- First of all. my love.
you didn't hire me.

26
00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:24.204
your father did.

27
00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:26.956
And anyway. here is
the file you asked for

28
00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:28.458
for the Ronaldo case.

29
00:03:29.417 --> 00:03:32.337
And as far as your espresso.

30
00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.214
oh. that was sitting
on the edge of my desk

31
00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:36.383
when you generously
walked by this morning.

32
00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:38.176
You didn't part your
mouth to say good morning.

33
00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.387
hello or anything of the such.

34
00:03:40.428 --> 00:03:42.722
so I'm pretty sure
it's cold by now.

35
00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.809
- Then heat it up.

36
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.060
I believe you know how to use

37
00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:49.938
the MWG top class
monogram microwave.

38
00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:51.106
instead of those what.

39
00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:52.899
pull handle Mainstays
you're used to?

40
00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:56.152
How much you pay for that
at the Dollar Store. $19?

41
00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:57.570
Oh. no. wait.

42
00:03:57.612 --> 00:03:59.823
You go to those thrift places
and get them half off. Ew.

43
00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:06.204
- First of all. Rainey.

44
00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:10.208
I am not your maid.
nor am I your servant.

45
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:16.089
If you want your
coffee warmed up.

46
00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:17.382
you warm it up yourself.

47
00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:21.302
I don't even know
what's gotten into you.

48
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.808
If it wasn't for your father.
you still be waiting tables.

49
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.893
- And you would still
be on top of them.

50
00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:31.271
- You know what? I'm not
even gon' do this with you.

51
00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:32.313
- [Rainey] Mm-hm.

52
00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:39.696
- Well. excuse you. Ugh.

53
00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:44.075
Girl. I cannot understand
for the life of me

54
00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:45.952
why you keep that trick here.

55
00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:48.455
- Girl. I just work here. Okay.

56
00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:50.040
And anyway. she's only here

57
00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:53.335
because my father left it in
the will that she stays on.

58
00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:54.961
But you know that's
because she was sleeping

59
00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:56.880
with his nasty butt.

60
00:04:56.921 --> 00:05:00.425
You know what? While my
mother was still in that home.

61
00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:02.635
- Your mother?

62
00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:08.600
Wait. when your mother deceased.
you was only 12 years old.

63
00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:11.353
So that makes Trudy
nine years old.

64
00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:16.107
So what you saying your
daddy was a child molester?

65
00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:17.359
- Really?

66
00:05:18.777 --> 00:05:22.155
I'm talking about her ashes
still being on the fireplace

67
00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:23.365
after all these years.

68
00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:25.658
People just don't
have any respect.

69
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.829
- Oh. Anyway. I'mma
just leave that alone.

70
00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:33.583
So do you have any
plans this weekend?

71
00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:38.546
Because I have two
expensive tickets to go see

72
00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:42.092
that new singer we both love.

73
00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:47.055
And VIP tickets. my girl.

74
00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:48.556
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

75
00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:52.185
- I've been trying to get
these tickets for months.

76
00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:54.354
They have been
completely sold out.

77
00:05:54.396 --> 00:05:57.232
- Well...
- How did you get these?

78
00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:59.275
- They don't call
malicious for nothing.

79
00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:03.279
- Ugh. You. you're just
nasty. You know what?

80
00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:04.739
I don't care how you got them

81
00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:06.700
because I'mma make
that man my baby daddy

82
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:08.952
the way he gon' sing
to me this weekend.

83
00:06:11.287 --> 00:06:12.706
- Wait.

84
00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:14.249
I thought you didn't
want any more kids

85
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.876
since you had a hard
time delivering Logan.

86
00:06:16.918 --> 00:06:20.338
- I don't. He's gonna replace
Logan's worthless dad.

87
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.090
Trudy's cousin. okay?

88
00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:24.509
Lemme call my brother so I
can get a permanent babysitter

89
00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:25.844
for this weekend.

90
00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:27.929
- Ah. Mr. Fine.

91
00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:33.351
Tell him malicious is still
waiting on her proposal.

92
00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:36.062
- Now. girl. I like you
way too much for that.

93
00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:38.773
And I love my brother.
he's my heart and all.

94
00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:40.775
but you know he's
on the down low.

95
00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:42.736
That's why Philomena
divorced him.

96
00:06:43.695 --> 00:06:45.947
- (speaker mumbles).
please don't remind me.

97
00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:47.240
- Okay.
- Okay?

98
00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:49.075
I had a setback for a moment.

99
00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:50.577
- Okay.
- Geez.

100
00:06:50.618 --> 00:06:51.745
- Oh. shoot. You know what?

101
00:06:51.786 --> 00:06:53.955
Before I forget
why you stopped by.

102
00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:54.789
- Uh-huh.

103
00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:08.303
Oh. honey. you are a life saver.

104
00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:09.637
- And don't you forget it.

105
00:07:10.638 --> 00:07:14.392
- Okay. so I'mma let
you get back to work

106
00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:16.561
and I'mma stop by the spank.

107
00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:19.314
- Okay.
- Okay? So call me later.

108
00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:20.774
- All right.

109
00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:23.193
- [Melisende] And I'mma come
by with some wine. okay?

110
00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:24.444
- You know what?

111
00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:25.570
That sounds like what
I need after this day.

112
00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:27.781
Just make sure it's
rich for my taste

113
00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:30.200
since I am the
one paying for it.

114
00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:33.620
and not that Irish rose wine
my dad used to drink. girl.

115
00:07:33.661 --> 00:07:35.789
- Girl. I got you. Okay.
- Okay.

116
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.457
I'll see you later.
- Have a good day. honey.

117
00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:39.042
- Later. boo.
- [Melisende] Bye-bye.

118
00:07:39.084 --> 00:07:41.586
(upbeat music)

119
00:07:44.047 --> 00:07:49.010
* Freaky. oh. oh

120
00:07:50.095 --> 00:07:52.806
* Freaky. oh. oh

121
00:07:55.517 --> 00:07:58.812
- So. honey. how
was school today?

122
00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:02.273
And where did you and your
uncle go after he picked you up?

123
00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:03.608
- School was great today. Ma.

124
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.027
I got this awesome
science project to do.

125
00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:08.113
and Uncle Evan took
me to the stores

126
00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:10.657
to get all the materials
I need to start it.

127
00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:11.991
He's gonna help me build it.

128
00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:15.370
Then. he took me to go
get the new mint OGs

129
00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:17.997
that actually just
came out yesterday.

130
00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:19.165
- Mm.

131
00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:20.583
- Also. he taught me
his new smooth moves

132
00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:22.168
on the basketball court.

133
00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:26.172
He said he was an all star
in high school. Was he. Mom?

134
00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:27.549
- Yes. he was.

135
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.510
And if it wasn't for this
condition that blocked him.

136
00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:32.262
he woulda went pro.

137
00:08:32.303 --> 00:08:34.514
But not to mention
all the haters.

138
00:08:34.556 --> 00:08:37.225
- What condition? He
seems healthy to me.

139
00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:39.019
- Oh. no. he is. baby.

140
00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.188
Just some people you
really need to pray for.

141
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.399
I'm so proud of how you
look up to your uncle.

142
00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:49.154
- Yes. Mama. He's the best uncle
any kid could ever ask for.

143
00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:50.739
That's why I don't miss my dad

144
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.033
'cause Uncle Evan
teaching me everything

145
00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:57.704
from fishing. fixing cars.
basketball and boxing.

146
00:08:57.746 --> 00:09:00.957
And you know what? Maybe
someday how to shave.

147
00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:05.795
- You have a long way
to go for that. okay?

148
00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:08.548
But yes. my brother
is one of a kind

149
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.217
and we are going to do
something wonderful for him

150
00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:12.469
for his birthday coming up.

151
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.429
- Can I please
pick out his gift?

152
00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:16.598
Okay. every time
we go to the mall.

153
00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:20.226
I see him staring at this
watch. and I know he wants it.

154
00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:23.313
but he always say it is
outta his league of pennies

155
00:09:23.355 --> 00:09:24.606
and I come first.

156
00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:28.568
- Yes. we'll do that for sure
after church this Sunday.

157
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.779
Okay?
- Yes. Mom.

158
00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:34.240
- What would I do without my
two favorite men in my life?

159
00:09:34.282 --> 00:09:36.618
- I'm not a man yet. Mom.

160
00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:40.205
- [Rainey] Mm. You got that
right? You're my little man.

161
00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:42.082
Now hurry you up and
eat those vegetables

162
00:09:42.123 --> 00:09:44.709
so you can grow up and be a
all star basketball player

163
00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:45.919
like your uncle.

164
00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:51.257
- Hey. y'all. hey. I
come bearing gifts.

165
00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:58.181
- What are you doing here?
I. I didn't invite you here.

166
00:09:58.223 --> 00:09:59.307
- I. I brought gifts.

167
00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:06.648
Well. I brought you a
bottle of some fresh wine

168
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.359
'cause you look like you had
such a stressful day today

169
00:10:09.401 --> 00:10:10.610
early in the office.

170
00:10:10.652 --> 00:10:11.861
So I brought you that.

171
00:10:11.903 --> 00:10:15.573
And for my cousin. I
brought you a gift as well.

172
00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:16.950
but look at you.

173
00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:21.454
You're getting so big and
handsome just like your dad.

174
00:10:21.496 --> 00:10:23.289
But this is for you.

175
00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:24.249
- Thank you.

176
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.417
- [Trudy] You're so welcome.

177
00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.044
- Thank you. baby. Mm-hmm.

178
00:10:28.086 --> 00:10:30.630
Please take your Family
Dollar gifts back with you.

179
00:10:30.672 --> 00:10:32.298
Thank you. but no thank you.

180
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.884
- But Ma. can we at least
see what got me first

181
00:10:34.926 --> 00:10:36.845
before she take
'em back. please.

182
00:10:38.555 --> 00:10:40.515
- Yes. mommy dearest.

183
00:10:40.557 --> 00:10:43.143
Can we please see what
his daddy got him?

184
00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:47.147
- Okay. baby. Sure.

185
00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:55.530
- Wow. Cool. Thank you so much.
This is just what I wanted.

186
00:10:55.572 --> 00:10:57.323
- See. (speaker mumbles)
Cousin Trudy's down

187
00:10:57.365 --> 00:10:58.742
with you generations.

188
00:10:58.783 --> 00:11:01.327
I know exactly what you like.
If you like it. I love it.

189
00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:04.289
- And I know what I would like.

190
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.958
Baby. go ahead and take
that into the other room

191
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.961
and allow me and Ms. Trudy to
continue to talk. okay. baby?

192
00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:11.338
- Yes. Mom.
- Thank you.

193
00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:14.883
- That's cousin Trudy.

194
00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:18.887
My goodness gracious.

195
00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:21.514
- Thank you again for the gift.

196
00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:22.640
I know you got it for me

197
00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:24.976
'cause my dad never
gets me anything.

198
00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:27.854
so you have no need to pretend.

199
00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:30.357
- Oh. you're so sweet.
- Bye-bye.

200
00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:33.318
- But don't worry. I'll be
back with more gifts. okay?

201
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.069
- Okay.

202
00:11:39.282 --> 00:11:43.703
- You know what. Rainey?
I'm going to pray for you.

203
00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:45.538
I don't know what's
happened to you.

204
00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.124
We. we used to be so cool.

205
00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:52.379
I am the reason that.
that. that Logan exist.

206
00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:56.299
I introduced you two. and
y'all was so happy and in love.

207
00:11:58.009 --> 00:12:00.720
- Yeah. maybe I grew up
after you was sleeping

208
00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:03.932
all through my
father's law firm.

209
00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:05.433
God had better for me.

210
00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:09.229
and it wasn't that ghetto
gang banging cousin of yours.

211
00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:13.733
Okay? He put 'em in prison
where wild animals belong.

212
00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:16.820
And I mean. let's be straight.

213
00:12:16.861 --> 00:12:21.199
The only thing that was
good on him was his penis.

214
00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:24.786
And that gave me
my blessing. Logan.

215
00:12:24.828 --> 00:12:27.539
So with that. leave.

216
00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:30.458
- You know what? You're right.

217
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.879
I should just leave before we
both say something we regret.

218
00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:40.635
You know what? You
gonna need me one day.

219
00:12:40.677 --> 00:12:41.886
Believe that.

220
00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:46.808
And God's gonna see to it
that he gets your attention.

221
00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:50.854
- That's probably the funniest
thing you've ever said.

222
00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:52.397
You should do standup comedy.

223
00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:54.566
Get out.

224
00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:01.322
- And will.

225
00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:05.368
(upbeat music)

226
00:13:17.756 --> 00:13:19.841
- [Evan] Now. sis.
what was so important

227
00:13:19.883 --> 00:13:21.718
that you had me drive
a whole hour away

228
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.969
just to come listen to you

229
00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:24.471
when you coulda called
me over the phone?

230
00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:27.766
You know I had a hot date
set up that I had to postpone

231
00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:30.435
because baby sis said
she needed to see me.

232
00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:31.644
What's up?

233
00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:34.397
- That's why baby
sis called you.

234
00:13:36.024 --> 00:13:38.651
Anyway. I just like looking
at your handsome face

235
00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:41.529
when I need to ask
you for something.

236
00:13:43.073 --> 00:13:45.617
What are you doing this
weekend and Monday morning?

237
00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:51.081
- Nothing much really.
It's my weekend off.

238
00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:55.001
Oh. I am planning on
taking Logan to the movies.

239
00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:56.086
You wanna join us?

240
00:13:56.127 --> 00:13:58.922
- Mm-mm. Maybe next time.

241
00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:00.173
I was gonna ask you.

242
00:14:00.215 --> 00:14:01.716
can you keep Logan
for the weekend

243
00:14:01.758 --> 00:14:04.344
and take him to
school Monday morning?

244
00:14:04.386 --> 00:14:06.888
- You know I don't mind.
- [Rainey] Okay.

245
00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:08.181
- Hold on. Hold. hold.

246
00:14:08.223 --> 00:14:11.851
Lemme find out you got a
whole date this weekend.

247
00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:16.648
- No. Melisende got
us front row tickets.

248
00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:22.654
backstage passes and VIP all
access to the after party

249
00:14:22.696 --> 00:14:23.905
for Little Rock this weekend.

250
00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:27.909
- [Evan] Say less.
You know I got you.

251
00:14:27.951 --> 00:14:29.577
- Yes. My favorite.

252
00:14:31.538 --> 00:14:32.997
Speaking of witch.

253
00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:35.792
you know that girl I've been
digging you since grade school.

254
00:14:35.834 --> 00:14:36.960
- [Evan] Who?

255
00:14:37.752 --> 00:14:40.046
- Who? Melisende.

256
00:14:40.088 --> 00:14:43.842
- [Evan] Oh. you got
jokes. You got jokes.

257
00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:45.051
- No.

258
00:14:45.093 --> 00:14:46.011
- You remember the
little hot date

259
00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:47.303
I was just telling you about?

260
00:14:47.345 --> 00:14:50.056
- [Rainey] Yeah.
- Just fine with me. I'm good.

261
00:14:50.098 --> 00:14:52.767
- You are too much.
You know that?

262
00:14:52.809 --> 00:14:55.729
And I love you to
the moon and back.

263
00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:59.607
And I would flip this
world upside down

264
00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:02.110
if anyone ever
hurt you or Logan.

265
00:15:03.737 --> 00:15:05.530
Just ask your ex. Philomena.

266
00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:08.366
- Oh. believe me. I know.

267
00:15:09.617 --> 00:15:11.828
She still complains about
that little knot on her head

268
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:14.581
and them scars after 15 years.

269
00:15:14.622 --> 00:15:16.666
See. that's why you
don't have a man now.

270
00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:17.625
You too violent.

271
00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:20.086
No. seriously.

272
00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.255
When are you gonna settle down.

273
00:15:22.297 --> 00:15:26.051
find you a nice young man
and get outta these streets?

274
00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:28.678
- You making it sound
like I'm dating all over.

275
00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.972
You know what? I'll indulge you.

276
00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:33.850
When the good Lord
sends me a man

277
00:15:33.892 --> 00:15:35.727
that makes twice as much as me.

278
00:15:35.769 --> 00:15:38.605
has no kids or baggage. okay.

279
00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:40.273
credit score over 900.

280
00:15:40.315 --> 00:15:43.401
drives a hundred thousand
dollar plus or more car.

281
00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:47.197
and owns a home
that's $1.5 million.

282
00:15:49.824 --> 00:15:51.785
- And that's why
you still single.

283
00:15:51.826 --> 00:15:56.122
You are truly Lester
Evans Storms' child.

284
00:15:56.164 --> 00:15:59.000
No wonder he left you the
business and everything else.

285
00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:05.006
I didn't quite. um.
fit his standards.

286
00:16:06.132 --> 00:16:08.677
Even being the first
born and only son.

287
00:16:11.179 --> 00:16:13.556
- I got you. You
know that. right?

288
00:16:14.766 --> 00:16:18.895
Daddy was wrong to judge you
and cut you out of his will

289
00:16:18.937 --> 00:16:21.356
just because of your
lifestyle and your choices.

290
00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:25.402
I love you no matter what

291
00:16:26.111 --> 00:16:29.030
and your nephew adores you.

292
00:16:30.031 --> 00:16:34.119
So just know that I got
you. whatever you need.

293
00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:38.540
- I know you got me. sis.
but I. I don't need that.

294
00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:42.335
I don't need that
man's dirty money.

295
00:16:42.377 --> 00:16:43.878
You know?

296
00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.840
I'd rather work both of
my jobs and then some

297
00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:48.258
before I take a dime from him.

298
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:53.847
- You don't have to.
but I understand.

299
00:16:53.888 --> 00:16:57.934
And if anything
ever happens to me.

300
00:16:57.976 --> 00:17:00.395
you and Logan are set for life.

301
00:17:00.437 --> 00:17:03.690
- Girl. ain't nothing
going to happen to you.

302
00:17:03.732 --> 00:17:07.193
You hardheaded. tough as steel.

303
00:17:08.403 --> 00:17:10.739
and you do your own thing.
- [Rainey] Mm-hm.

304
00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:15.035
- By the way. where is Logan?

305
00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:16.745
- Mm. He's knocked out.

306
00:17:16.786 --> 00:17:21.332
He. uh. had a physical today.
tried out for basketball.

307
00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:23.710
You know he wanna
be like his uncle.

308
00:17:23.752 --> 00:17:26.421
- [Evan] Yeah. yeah. can
you blame him? Nah. nah.

309
00:17:26.463 --> 00:17:29.341
I have taught him some of my
moves from back in the day.

310
00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:30.425
- Okay.

311
00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:32.052
- That kid is good.
- [Rainey] Yeah.

312
00:17:32.093 --> 00:17:34.471
- Better than me good.
- [Rainey] Mm.

313
00:17:34.512 --> 00:17:38.058
- So. you know. at least
he won't have anything

314
00:17:38.099 --> 00:17:39.851
holding him back
from being drafted.

315
00:17:41.936 --> 00:17:43.063
So. you know. I been
working with him

316
00:17:43.104 --> 00:17:45.106
and. uh. working
on that dribble.

317
00:17:45.148 --> 00:17:50.278
And mark my words. a storm
is gonna be in the NBA.

318
00:17:51.738 --> 00:17:56.534
- Evan. that was their
loss back in the day. Okay?

319
00:17:56.576 --> 00:17:59.079
To me. you're still
my famous all-star

320
00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.705
basketball-playing brother.

321
00:18:01.748 --> 00:18:04.709
You know they were
scared of you. right?

322
00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:06.670
And they still can't touch you.

323
00:18:07.962 --> 00:18:09.381
And daddy coulda beat that case.

324
00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:13.385
but hey. look on
the bright side.

325
00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:16.805
you get to watch Logan
grow up every single day

326
00:18:16.846 --> 00:18:18.139
and not miss one.

327
00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.434
And to be honest.
that's what he needs.

328
00:18:21.476 --> 00:18:25.105
He needs a male role model
like you in his life.

329
00:18:25.146 --> 00:18:27.148
And aside from all of that.

330
00:18:28.483 --> 00:18:31.986
instead of traveling
the world with a ball.

331
00:18:32.028 --> 00:18:34.239
you get to babysit
for me all weekend

332
00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.616
so I can go see Little Rock.

333
00:18:36.658 --> 00:18:40.078
- I don't mind it. you
know? I love y'all.

334
00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.496
- [Rainey] Mm.
- And you're right.

335
00:18:41.538 --> 00:18:44.040
I would've given all that up
and watch my little nephew.

336
00:18:44.082 --> 00:18:45.750
- [Rainey] Yeah.

337
00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:47.502
- That kid is brilliant.

338
00:18:47.544 --> 00:18:48.837
You know he get
that for me. right?

339
00:18:48.878 --> 00:18:52.841
- Mm-mm. He get that ask
too many questions from you.

340
00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:54.175
For sure.
- Whatever.

341
00:18:54.217 --> 00:18:56.011
Normally. he hears my voice

342
00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:58.096
and comes bolting

343
00:18:58.138 --> 00:18:59.139
My nephew that tired?

344
00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:02.350
- Ugh. He is beat. Okay?

345
00:19:02.392 --> 00:19:03.685
I was on the phone.

346
00:19:03.727 --> 00:19:06.438
he was playing that game

347
00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:11.401
low life. trailer trash Tru-
(gags)

348
00:19:11.443 --> 00:19:13.987
- Sis. we ain't
gon' do that. Mm-mm.

349
00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:17.198
- Trudy bought him. Whatever.

350
00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:21.745
Anyway. between
basketball tryouts

351
00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:25.165
and karate class and shopping
and playing that game.

352
00:19:25.206 --> 00:19:27.000
he's worn out.

353
00:19:27.042 --> 00:19:29.169
- Okay. I mean. you
know. can you blame him?

354
00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:30.337
He's a kid. you know?

355
00:19:30.378 --> 00:19:32.964
- [Rainey] Yeah.
- Very energetic. I get it.

356
00:19:33.006 --> 00:19:36.009
But. um. I. I gotta go.

357
00:19:36.051 --> 00:19:37.469
- Where you go-

358
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.387
- Look. I'm. I'm gonna be with
him the whole weekend. sis.

359
00:19:39.429 --> 00:19:40.805
- But where you going?

360
00:19:40.847 --> 00:19:43.350
- Listen. just be careful
at those concerts.

361
00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:46.978
after parties. backstage.
wherever y'all doing.

362
00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.188
- [Rainey] Mm.

363
00:19:48.229 --> 00:19:49.439
- I hear they drug
women at those events.

364
00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:53.651
- They never met Rainey Storms.

365
00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:57.113
And you know daddy always
said I was tough like mommy.

366
00:19:57.155 --> 00:19:58.365
Right?

367
00:19:58.406 --> 00:20:04.079
So if they ever try
it. I'll be ready.

368
00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.205
- [Evan] Rainey.
- What?

369
00:20:05.246 --> 00:20:06.539
- [Evan] Really?
- Hmm?

370
00:20:06.581 --> 00:20:08.041
- Be careful with that thing.

371
00:20:08.083 --> 00:20:10.543
- [Rainey] I will.
- I mean. my God.

372
00:20:10.585 --> 00:20:12.170
I know you don't have
that out around Logan.

373
00:20:12.212 --> 00:20:14.089
- Oh. of course not.

374
00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:16.132
I mean. I keep it
locked away usually

375
00:20:16.174 --> 00:20:18.927
in a safe in my bedroom.

376
00:20:18.968 --> 00:20:20.470
He has no idea I have it.

377
00:20:20.512 --> 00:20:25.016
But listen. I'm a well
established. wealthy.

378
00:20:25.058 --> 00:20:26.768
not to mention fine.

379
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:30.438
single mother of a 12
year old son living alone.

380
00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:34.567
So I'm a target to thugs.
like his daddy. to try me.

381
00:20:34.609 --> 00:20:37.320
And when they do. I'll be ready.

382
00:20:38.655 --> 00:20:42.409
- I mean. you do know you
had a child by that thug.

383
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.744
I'm just playing.
I'm just playing.

384
00:20:44.786 --> 00:20:47.747
All serious. and. sis.
I understand. Trust me.

385
00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:49.541
I just want you to be
careful. All right?

386
00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:50.625
- Mm.

387
00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:51.960
- Look. you gotta
protect yourself.

388
00:20:52.002 --> 00:20:54.045
especially living in the
world that we're in today.

389
00:20:54.087 --> 00:20:55.588
- [Rainey] Mm-hmm.

390
00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:58.258
- All right? I'll.
I'll pick Logan up...

391
00:20:58.299 --> 00:20:59.467
- Okay.
- Tomorrow.

392
00:21:00.135 --> 00:21:01.302
Have fun.

393
00:21:03.096 --> 00:21:04.472
That way. you know. you'll have.

394
00:21:04.514 --> 00:21:07.142
you know. you have more time
to be able to do your thing.

395
00:21:07.183 --> 00:21:08.143
get on the road early

396
00:21:08.184 --> 00:21:09.352
- [Rainey] Okay.

397
00:21:09.394 --> 00:21:10.854
- But listen.

398
00:21:10.895 --> 00:21:12.731
I. I know you're not gonna
like what I'm about to say.

399
00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:14.149
- What?

400
00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:17.819
- Can you please just
give Trudy a chance?

401
00:21:17.861 --> 00:21:22.949
She's cooler than what you
think. Just give her a chance.

402
00:21:22.991 --> 00:21:24.367
- You know what?

403
00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:29.122
I was loving whatever this
was in my whole entire hearts.

404
00:21:29.164 --> 00:21:33.376
But you know what?
Yeah. Mm-hmm. yeah.

405
00:21:33.418 --> 00:21:35.670
- All right.
(both chuckling)

406
00:21:35.712 --> 00:21:38.173
Oh. and when Logan
get up in the morning.

407
00:21:38.214 --> 00:21:39.466
tell him I want my $20.

408
00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.509
- $20 for what?
- Yes.

409
00:21:41.551 --> 00:21:43.970
- Evan. you got my son gambling?

410
00:21:44.012 --> 00:21:46.139
- No. No. no.

411
00:21:46.181 --> 00:21:49.184
He bet me that every
time I stop by.

412
00:21:49.225 --> 00:21:50.435
he could hear my voice.

413
00:21:50.477 --> 00:21:52.562
no matter how deep
of a sleep he was in.

414
00:21:52.604 --> 00:21:55.315
And if he missed me.
then he'd owe me $20.

415
00:21:55.357 --> 00:21:57.650
So tell him to pay
up. I want my 20.

416
00:21:57.692 --> 00:22:00.695
- You know what? Y'all
are too much for me.

417
00:22:00.737 --> 00:22:06.159
But please drive carefully.
Text me when you get there.

418
00:22:06.201 --> 00:22:07.494
- Yes. mother.

419
00:22:07.535 --> 00:22:09.954
Nah. seriously. I'm
'bout to go and. uh.

420
00:22:09.996 --> 00:22:12.999
try to salvage the
rest of this hot date.

421
00:22:13.041 --> 00:22:19.339
But enjoy that concert.
and please lock that door.

422
00:22:19.381 --> 00:22:22.300
You always leave that door
unlocked. Yes. you do.

423
00:22:22.342 --> 00:22:24.260
Listen. it doesn't
matter how safe

424
00:22:24.302 --> 00:22:26.471
and pretty this neighborhood is.

425
00:22:26.513 --> 00:22:28.640
there's dangerous
people everywhere. sis.

426
00:22:29.599 --> 00:22:31.601
Sometimes even next door.

427
00:22:32.894 --> 00:22:36.648
- Okay. Mental note.
I will lock the door.

428
00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:39.359
I'll remember. okay?
- [Evan] All right.

429
00:22:39.401 --> 00:22:41.403
- Text me when you get there.

430
00:22:42.237 --> 00:22:44.239
And yes. I am you
and Logan's mama.

431
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.949
just like you our daddy dead.

432
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:46.866
Come on.

433
00:22:46.908 --> 00:22:48.702
(music drowns out speaker)

434
00:22:48.743 --> 00:22:51.371
* That I'm half without you

435
00:22:51.413 --> 00:22:56.251
* We're just meant to be

436
00:22:56.292 --> 00:22:59.254
* I hope you feeling
the same way too

437
00:22:59.295 --> 00:23:01.923
* 'Cause every
moment you're near

438
00:23:01.965 --> 00:23:05.760
* It's far too clear that

439
00:23:05.802 --> 00:23:08.221
* You took my
heart for keeping

440
00:23:08.263 --> 00:23:11.391
* And it won't stop beating

441
00:23:11.433 --> 00:23:12.642
- Boom.

442
00:23:12.684 --> 00:23:15.603
Uncle Evan. that
was a great movie.

443
00:23:15.645 --> 00:23:17.564
Thank you so much for taking me.

444
00:23:17.605 --> 00:23:19.649
- [Evan] Oh.
- Can we go see it again?

445
00:23:19.691 --> 00:23:22.402
- [Evan] Uh. maybe
on my day off. man.

446
00:23:22.444 --> 00:23:23.528
But it was a great
movie though. man.

447
00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:25.321
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

448
00:23:25.363 --> 00:23:27.115
- [Logan] Thank you.
- [Evan] Mm-Hmm. No prob.

449
00:23:27.157 --> 00:23:32.078
Didn't I tell your mom to
lock that door before we left?

450
00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.496
- Yes. sir.

451
00:23:33.538 --> 00:23:36.207
- I guess she was just
excited to go see that Little.

452
00:23:36.249 --> 00:23:37.208
Little Rock dude.

453
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:39.794
- Yeah. it's her
favorite singer.

454
00:23:39.836 --> 00:23:42.922
I got to listen to that
song. like. every day.

455
00:23:42.964 --> 00:23:43.715
- I bet.

456
00:23:45.175 --> 00:23:47.927
You know. that's kinda like
my mother and my grandmother.

457
00:23:47.969 --> 00:23:48.803
you know?

458
00:23:48.845 --> 00:23:50.555
But we had to listen to BB King.

459
00:23:52.265 --> 00:23:53.600
- BB King?

460
00:23:53.641 --> 00:23:55.769
- Yeah. It's a little bit
ahead of your time. my man.

461
00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:59.356
So listen. I need you to run
upstairs. grab your pajamas.

462
00:23:59.397 --> 00:24:00.899
two outfits.

463
00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:03.401
and please make sure you
grab your church clothes.

464
00:24:03.443 --> 00:24:04.903
- Yes. sir.

465
00:24:04.944 --> 00:24:07.947
But can I also bring my new
game Cousin Trudy got me.

466
00:24:07.989 --> 00:24:11.159
so I can show you all the new
cool tricks I learned. please?

467
00:24:11.201 --> 00:24:15.622
- Ah. I guess. Just make
sure you grab everything.

468
00:24:15.663 --> 00:24:19.042
That hour is a long drive all
the way back here. All right?

469
00:24:19.084 --> 00:24:20.251
- Yes. sir.

470
00:24:20.293 --> 00:24:21.461
- [Evan] All right. go
ahead man. Hurry up.

471
00:24:21.503 --> 00:24:24.506
- [Logan] Yes. sir.
(solemn music)

472
00:24:54.369 --> 00:24:55.912
(burglar clears throat)

473
00:24:55.954 --> 00:24:57.330
- [Burglar 1] You do
know it's rude of you

474
00:24:57.372 --> 00:24:58.581
to throw a man's
food away. right?

475
00:24:59.582 --> 00:25:04.337
- Excuse me? What are
you doing in this house?

476
00:25:04.379 --> 00:25:06.381
Rainey is not home.
Did she let you in?

477
00:25:06.423 --> 00:25:07.382
- [Burglar 1] Thanks
for the heads up.

478
00:25:07.424 --> 00:25:08.925
but I'm not here for Rainey.

479
00:25:09.801 --> 00:25:11.636
- Then what are you here for?

480
00:25:12.721 --> 00:25:16.474
- [Burglar 2] Let's just
say we the delivery people.

481
00:25:16.516 --> 00:25:18.351
- We came in to
deliver a homicide.

482
00:25:18.393 --> 00:25:22.397
- If you think I'm 'bout to
let you walk up in this house.

483
00:25:22.439 --> 00:25:26.651
unannounced. and attack
me without a fight.

484
00:25:28.319 --> 00:25:29.696
must be losing your mind.

485
00:25:29.738 --> 00:25:31.573
I don't know why you here
and I don't know who you are.

486
00:25:31.614 --> 00:25:33.783
but you need to get outta
this house right now.

487
00:25:33.825 --> 00:25:35.702
- You hearing this. man?
- [Burglar 2] I hear him.

488
00:25:35.744 --> 00:25:37.996
- Hear him talking. I hear you.

489
00:25:39.664 --> 00:25:41.708
- [Burglar 2]
Where's the kid at?

490
00:25:44.252 --> 00:25:45.503
- You gon' have to kill me

491
00:25:45.545 --> 00:25:47.881
before I let you lay
one hand on my nephew.

492
00:25:47.922 --> 00:25:49.924
- [Burglar 1] Oh.
that can be arranged.

493
00:25:54.888 --> 00:25:57.223
- [Logan] Uncle Evan. you okay?

494
00:25:57.265 --> 00:25:58.558
- [Burglar 2] Gimme that bag.

495
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:02.395
- Come here. Come
here. come here.

496
00:26:02.437 --> 00:26:03.730
Like I said before.

497
00:26:03.772 --> 00:26:06.399
you and you need to leave
this house right now.

498
00:26:06.441 --> 00:26:09.235
- [Burglar 2] I see we have
two who ain't paying attention.

499
00:26:09.277 --> 00:26:12.405
Like my friend here said.
don't ask to it. punk.

500
00:26:12.447 --> 00:26:13.907
Nobody ain't going nowhere.

501
00:26:13.948 --> 00:26:17.118
This is my last time.
Hand over the bed.

502
00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.079
- And any cellphones
you may have. please.

503
00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:22.123
Don't make this harder
than what it is.

504
00:26:23.458 --> 00:26:25.377
Now. I see we have
your attention.

505
00:26:26.753 --> 00:26:30.590
- Leave my nephew out of this.
all right. He's just a kid.

506
00:26:30.632 --> 00:26:33.927
He don't understand
what's going on right now.

507
00:26:33.968 --> 00:26:37.597
If this got anything to
do with me or. or money.

508
00:26:37.639 --> 00:26:40.475
look. let's just leave
and handle this as men.

509
00:26:40.517 --> 00:26:42.394
All right? Leave him outta this.

510
00:26:43.561 --> 00:26:44.813
- [Burglar 2] Gimme the bag.

511

00:34:14.095 --> 00:34:16.765
I mean. who. who put
you both up to this?

668
00:34:16.806 --> 00:34:18.266
- Oh. my god.

take in. but this is real.

670

00:34:34.657 --> 00:34:35.950
You just came into my house

675
00:34:39.621 --> 00:34:42.374

'Cause these are all lies

would wanna harm Evan.

683
00:35:04.688 --> 00:35:06.106
or did he have any enemies?

684
00:35:06.147 --> 00:35:08.108
Would you please give us a call?

685
00:35:08.149 --> 00:35:11.820
- My brother had no enemies.

686
00:35:12.946 --> 00:35:14.864
And who would want to kill

687
00:35:15.949 --> 00:35:18.827
my 12. my 12 year old son?

688
00:35:20.036 --> 00:35:24.916
Get out of my house!
Leave now! Get out.

689
00:35:26.126 --> 00:35:28.670
- Ms. Storms. we truly
are sorry for your loss.

690
00:35:29.713 --> 00:35:32.841
And trust we will
find who did this.

691
00:35:34.217 --> 00:35:37.095
- Look. this is a lot for
her to take in right now.

692
00:35:37.137 --> 00:35:39.139
Could you guys please
give her some air?

693
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:42.058
I mean. I don't understand.

694
00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:44.644
Everyone loved Evan.

695
00:35:44.686 --> 00:35:47.522
And who wanna kill
Logan? He is just a kid.

696
00:35:50.775 --> 00:35:53.153
I mean. you was right. Rainey.

697
00:35:53.194 --> 00:35:54.821
You said something wasn't right

698
00:35:55.864 --> 00:35:57.741
when you went upstairs
and found his tennis shoe

699
00:35:57.782 --> 00:35:59.743
on the ground in his room.

700
00:36:00.952 --> 00:36:02.912
- When? Did you see this?

701
00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:10.420
- Yes. We realized Evan car
was parked in the driveway.

702
00:36:10.462 --> 00:36:12.672
Rainey went upstairs and
saw that he had his shoe

703
00:36:12.714 --> 00:36:13.798
on the floor.

704
00:36:15.383 --> 00:36:18.011
- We'll need forensics
to dust for fingerprints.

705
00:36:18.053 --> 00:36:20.430
Ms. Storms. is this
the tennis shoe?

706
00:36:20.472 --> 00:36:22.557
We need to bag
this for evidence.

707
00:36:27.103 --> 00:36:31.191
* It's better to pray. pray

708
00:36:31.232 --> 00:36:33.860
- Could you guys please leave?

709
00:36:34.569 --> 00:36:36.237
- [Detective Stonewall] Yes.

710
00:36:36.279 --> 00:36:37.989
- She will give you guys a call.

711
00:36:39.115 --> 00:36:41.493
- Yes. we will leave.

712
00:36:41.534 --> 00:36:43.203
We'll wait out until team comes.

713
00:36:43.244 --> 00:36:46.081
But we need to this
place for evidence.

714
00:36:46.122 --> 00:36:49.042
We think the crime started here.

715
00:36:49.084 --> 00:36:54.089
- Well. you guys just find
out the scarbs that did this.

716
00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:57.300
* Yeah. we broken

717
00:36:57.342 --> 00:36:58.760
- Why. God? Why?

718
00:37:01.846 --> 00:37:04.265
Why would you take my brother?

719
00:37:06.601 --> 00:37:07.519
I hate you.

720
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:11.481
- [Melisende] Okay. Calm down.

721
00:37:11.523 --> 00:37:14.442
- No. No. the world
will pay for this.

722
00:37:14.484 --> 00:37:19.280
- [Melisende] I know. sis.
I know. I know. Calm down.

723
00:37:19.322 --> 00:37:21.991
Oh. my God. My God. Oh. my God.

724
00:37:22.951 --> 00:37:24.828
* Pray

725
00:37:27.038 --> 00:37:29.624
(upbeat music)

726
00:37:39.134 --> 00:37:40.802
- Yes. honey. Yes.

727
00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:45.390
All of this will be mine soon.

728
00:37:46.141 --> 00:37:47.642
After all these years

729
00:37:48.643 --> 00:37:52.230
of being under your
evil daughter's control.

730
00:37:52.272 --> 00:37:54.941
When it said states
clearly in the will

731
00:37:54.983 --> 00:37:57.485
that 20% of this belongs to me.

732
00:37:58.278 --> 00:38:01.072
Hm. But look at her now.

733
00:38:02.741 --> 00:38:05.326
Her whole world
is crumbling down.

734
00:38:07.912 --> 00:38:12.167
And instead of you turning
your back on Evans.

735
00:38:12.208 --> 00:38:14.544
you shoulda gave
him the business.

736
00:38:14.586 --> 00:38:16.463
You know that he woulda
been the better seed

737
00:38:16.504 --> 00:38:18.214
to run this business.

738
00:38:18.256 --> 00:38:19.007
Not Rainey.

739
00:38:20.717 --> 00:38:22.844
(Melisende clears throat)
- Excuse me.

740
00:38:24.512 --> 00:38:26.723
What are you doing
in Rainey's office?

741
00:38:26.765 --> 00:38:29.851
And what did you say
about my best friend?

742
00:38:29.893 --> 00:38:31.227
- Um. first of all.

743
00:38:31.269 --> 00:38:33.646
I don't have to answer
any questions to you.

744
00:38:33.688 --> 00:38:36.191
And Rainey's not
here. so why are you?

745
00:38:36.232 --> 00:38:37.776
- I know she's not here.

746
00:38:37.817 --> 00:38:39.861
I came here to get
some of her files

747
00:38:39.903 --> 00:38:42.530
so she don't lose
any more clients.

748
00:38:42.572 --> 00:38:46.451
And I know she would
not be happy to know

749
00:38:46.493 --> 00:38:48.411
that you was in her office.

750
00:38:48.453 --> 00:38:51.164
dancing and lusting
over her father's photo

751
00:38:51.206 --> 00:38:53.249
with your nasty self.

752
00:38:53.291 --> 00:38:56.336
- First of all. nobody
was lusting over anyone.

753
00:38:56.378 --> 00:38:57.837
Second of all.

754
00:38:57.879 --> 00:39:00.507
I'm the only person in here
keeping this business together

755
00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:05.387
while she's at a home sobbing
over a bottle of alcohol.

756
00:39:05.428 --> 00:39:08.932
- Are you serious or
just plain stupid?

757
00:39:09.891 --> 00:39:12.894
Rainey lost her
brother and her son.

758
00:39:13.895 --> 00:39:18.483
As matter of fact. she
lost a lot in her life.

759
00:39:18.525 --> 00:39:23.113
She lost her mother when
she was only 12 years old.

760
00:39:23.154 --> 00:39:28.451
She lost her father. her
brother. and her only child.

761
00:39:29.577 --> 00:39:33.289
So how you expect somebody
to bounce back from that?

762
00:39:33.331 --> 00:39:36.626
You can keep your wise
cracks to yourself.

763
00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:42.549
- This is exactly why
Theodore Evan Storm

764
00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:48.054
shoulda left this entire
business to his half daughter.

765
00:39:48.096 --> 00:39:50.348
- What are you talking about?

766
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:53.560
Mr. Evans has no other
children but two.

767
00:39:53.601 --> 00:39:57.397
So you can stop with all your
lies like you did in the past

768
00:39:57.439 --> 00:40:00.066
when you was around here
faking up a 10 pregnancy

769
00:40:00.108 --> 00:40:01.901
until your belly fell out.

770
00:40:01.943 --> 00:40:05.739
- Well. first of all. I wasn't
talking about no other child.

771
00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:09.117
I was talking about
Rainey's brother.

772
00:40:09.159 --> 00:40:11.077
The one she calls man.

773
00:40:11.119 --> 00:40:15.915
You know. half man one place
and half woman in the other.

774
00:40:15.957 --> 00:40:20.295
- You have no respect or
compassion for the dead.

775
00:40:20.337 --> 00:40:21.629
You are tripping.

776
00:40:23.506 --> 00:40:25.133
- Oh. well. honey. I do.

777
00:40:25.175 --> 00:40:26.343
You got to remember.

778
00:40:26.384 --> 00:40:29.012
it was my cousin got
caught up in this mess.

779
00:40:29.054 --> 00:40:32.515
And honey. if she wasn't
paying your mortgage.

780
00:40:32.557 --> 00:40:36.436
paying your car note or
being your personal ATM.

781
00:40:36.478 --> 00:40:38.688
oh. you be saying
the same exact thing.

782
00:40:40.482 --> 00:40:41.733
- So what you mean?

783
00:40:43.068 --> 00:40:45.945
You know who did this
to Logan and Evan?

784
00:40:45.987 --> 00:40:47.447
Because if you do.

785
00:40:47.489 --> 00:40:50.283
you better say something
before I beat it outta you.

786
00:40:50.325 --> 00:40:52.869
- I wish you would.
Go ahead and try me.

787
00:40:52.911 --> 00:40:55.205
Remember. boo. we ain't
10 years old no more.

788
00:40:57.499 --> 00:41:00.126
- Just go ahead and get
out my office please.

789
00:41:00.168 --> 00:41:05.006
so I can call Rainey and get
the combination to the lockbox.

790
00:41:05.048 --> 00:41:07.384
- Hm. I'mma go ahead
and leave this office.

791
00:41:07.425 --> 00:41:09.469
But while you talking to her.

792
00:41:09.511 --> 00:41:12.639
be sure you tell her
that the bills are due.

793
00:41:12.681 --> 00:41:14.683
She's already lost four clients.

794
00:41:14.724 --> 00:41:16.643
and if she doesn't
wanna lose anymore.

795
00:41:16.685 --> 00:41:18.645
she needs to seek counseling.

796
00:41:18.687 --> 00:41:20.730
Matter of fact. I
know of a great one.

797
00:41:20.772 --> 00:41:22.565
He does wonders for me.

798
00:41:22.607 --> 00:41:26.319
I'm pretty sure he can do
wonders for her too. Hm.

799
00:41:26.361 --> 00:41:28.697
- [Melisende] Okay.
Have a good day.

800
00:41:29.948 --> 00:41:30.740
- And will.

801
00:41:32.617 --> 00:41:35.495
- Ooh. I can't
stand that heifer.

802
00:41:35.537 --> 00:41:39.708
I don't understand
why Mr. Storms ever
sinked in that trick.

803
00:41:41.418 --> 00:41:42.627
My gosh.

804
00:41:53.471 --> 00:41:58.184
Hello. Rainey. I have
called you over 50 times.

805
00:41:58.226 --> 00:42:00.186
You need to hurry up and
get back to your office

806
00:42:00.228 --> 00:42:05.025
before I go LisaRaye from
"The Players Club" on Trudy.

807
00:42:05.066 --> 00:42:07.485
Can you believe she
was in your office.

808
00:42:07.527 --> 00:42:10.447
dancing and lusting
to your father's photo

809
00:42:10.488 --> 00:42:12.574
with her little nasty self?

810
00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:16.536
I need the combination
number to your lockbox

811
00:42:16.578 --> 00:42:19.122
so I can get the files.

812
00:42:19.164 --> 00:42:20.707
Answer your phone.

813
00:42:20.749 --> 00:42:26.046
I have called you over many
times. I do have my key.

814
00:42:26.087 --> 00:42:28.965
Bye.
(tense music)

815
00:42:43.563 --> 00:42:48.735
- Trudy Brown. Haven't
seen you since my wedding.

816
00:42:49.986 --> 00:42:51.738
I didn't know
Rainey kept you on.

817
00:42:55.075 --> 00:42:59.579
- Well. Ms. Philomena.
what brings you this way?

818
00:42:59.621 --> 00:43:01.748
- Well. I came to
talk with Rainey

819
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:02.916
since I don't know
where she lives.

820
00:43:02.957 --> 00:43:06.586
I heard what happened.
What a tragedy.

821
00:43:06.628 --> 00:43:08.755
My heart drops
straight to the floor.

822
00:43:09.631 --> 00:43:12.258
Who would do this to my husband?

823
00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:14.052
- You do mean your ex-husband.

824
00:43:14.094 --> 00:43:16.846
What. it's been like
15 years divorce?

825
00:43:16.888 --> 00:43:21.393
If I'm correct. I think
he left you for Carl.

826
00:43:21.434 --> 00:43:23.061
Or was that Rick?

827
00:43:23.103 --> 00:43:26.439
- He will always be
my husband at heart.

828
00:43:26.481 --> 00:43:29.109
I was his only wife
and he never remarried.

829
00:43:30.318 --> 00:43:35.281
Besides. you're just upset that
he didn't leave me for you.

830
00:43:35.323 --> 00:43:40.161
- No. darling. Evan is
like a brother to me.

831
00:43:40.203 --> 00:43:42.205
I ain't never even
seen him like that.

832
00:43:43.456 --> 00:43:46.626
But. um. trust and
belief. if I did.

833
00:43:46.668 --> 00:43:48.628
he would never be
a second thought

834
00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:50.672
about him leaving you for me.

835
00:43:52.173 --> 00:43:54.384
- Keep telling yourself
that. sweetheart.

836
00:43:54.426 --> 00:43:56.302
Look. I didn't come here to
go back and forth with you.

837
00:43:56.344 --> 00:43:59.889
I came here to chat with
Rainey and offer my services.

838
00:43:59.931 --> 00:44:02.225
When I'd heard what happened.
I was out in The Bahamas.

839
00:44:02.267 --> 00:44:04.769
- Well. as you can see.
Rainey is not here.

840
00:44:04.811 --> 00:44:06.813
So what I can do
is take your number

841
00:44:06.855 --> 00:44:09.107
and let her know
that you stopped by

842
00:44:09.149 --> 00:44:12.318
to see if there was
any insurance money
for you to claim.

843
00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:16.531
- Why. thank you. And no.
that's not why I came here.

844
00:44:16.573 --> 00:44:18.074
By the way. nice office.

845
00:44:18.116 --> 00:44:22.829
I see Rainey takes good
care of her hired help.

846
00:44:24.706 --> 00:44:27.375
- Hello. Excuse me.

847
00:44:27.417 --> 00:44:28.418
- Yes.

848
00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:29.794
- Trudy Brown available?
- I'm her.

849
00:44:31.504 --> 00:44:32.672
How can I help you?

850
00:44:32.714 --> 00:44:34.382
- May I have a seat?
- Absolutely.

851
00:44:36.051 --> 00:44:39.012
Who are you and what
can I do for you?

852
00:44:39.054 --> 00:44:39.888
- Sure.

853
00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:42.766
I am Detective Smith.

854
00:44:43.808 --> 00:44:45.352
and I'm working on a murder case

855
00:44:45.393 --> 00:44:49.773
with Ms. Storms' son Logan
and brother Evan Storms.

856
00:44:49.814 --> 00:44:52.859
- Yeah. such a
tragedy. Terrible.

857
00:44:52.901 --> 00:44:56.071
But what. what do
you need with me?

858
00:44:56.112 --> 00:44:58.490
- If you don't mind. may I stay?

859
00:44:58.531 --> 00:45:02.452
I wanna know if you have any
leads on who did this to Evan.

860
00:45:02.494 --> 00:45:03.620
- And may I ask who you are

861
00:45:03.661 --> 00:45:05.872
and your connection
to Mr. Evan Storms?

862
00:45:05.914 --> 00:45:09.542
- Yes. I'm Philomena
Storms. I'm his wife.

863
00:45:09.584 --> 00:45:11.836
- His ex-wife.

864
00:45:11.878 --> 00:45:14.798
- [Detective Smith] I didn't
know Mr. Storms was married.

865
00:45:14.839 --> 00:45:19.010
- Like I said. Detective.
ex-wife of 20 years.

866
00:45:19.052 --> 00:45:23.848
- Yes. I am his ex-wife.
But do you have any leads?

867
00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:25.850
- Well. we questioning
everyone that knew them

868
00:45:25.892 --> 00:45:27.394
and worked with Ms. Storms.

869
00:45:27.435 --> 00:45:31.231
So are you partners with Ms.
Storms or another attorney?

870
00:45:31.272 --> 00:45:34.859
- No. she is. was and
still a gold digger.

871
00:45:34.901 --> 00:45:38.154
- I came here to talk with
Rainey and offer my services

872
00:45:38.196 --> 00:45:41.074
because I wasn't able to
attend the funeral service.

873
00:45:41.116 --> 00:45:43.660
- And what about you
Ms. or Mrs. Brown?

874
00:45:43.702 --> 00:45:45.954
- It's Ms. and I'm
practically the owner

875
00:45:45.995 --> 00:45:47.664
of this establishment.

876
00:45:47.706 --> 00:45:49.874
You see. I am the
financial advisor.

877
00:45:49.916 --> 00:45:52.836
- Huh. So otherwise.
you a secretary.

878
00:45:52.877 --> 00:45:55.005
And how long have
you known Ms. Storms?

879
00:45:55.046 --> 00:45:57.507
- I've known Ms.
Storms for a while.

880
00:45:57.549 --> 00:46:00.927
We actually grew up together
and I'm cousins with her son.

881
00:46:00.969 --> 00:46:02.846
- So you a relative?
- Not quite.

882
00:46:02.887 --> 00:46:05.932
You see. her. her
son is my cousin

883
00:46:05.974 --> 00:46:08.893
because my cousin
Blade is his father.

884
00:46:08.935 --> 00:46:12.564
- And where can I find
this Blade. Logan's father?

885
00:46:12.605 --> 00:46:13.773
- Sure.

886
00:46:13.815 --> 00:46:15.734
You can find him at the
Mansfield State Prison

887
00:46:15.775 --> 00:46:18.945
where he's been since
Logan was two years old.

888
00:46:18.987 --> 00:46:21.239
and he would be there
for the next 18 years.

889
00:46:21.281 --> 00:46:22.866
But I'm pretty sure
Ms. Rainey exp-

890
00:46:22.907 --> 00:46:24.117
explained all this to you.

891
00:46:24.159 --> 00:46:25.702
- Well. we been giving
her some time to heal

892
00:46:25.744 --> 00:46:26.870
through this tragedy.

893
00:46:28.204 --> 00:46:31.624
Listen. does Ms. Storms
have any enemies as clients

894
00:46:31.666 --> 00:46:33.251
since you know all
the cases that comes?

895
00:46:33.293 --> 00:46:37.047
- Well. I will say this.
Rainey is definitely a handful.

896
00:46:37.088 --> 00:46:39.799
and can have a bad
attitude at sometimes.

897
00:46:39.841 --> 00:46:45.764
but I haven't seen any
clients that do not like her.

898
00:46:45.805 --> 00:46:47.182
Everybody seems to love
her for some odd reason.

899
00:46:47.223 --> 00:46:52.354
So. no. But you might
wanna check with his ex.

900
00:46:54.689 --> 00:46:56.691
- And why would you say that?

901
00:46:56.733 --> 00:46:58.610
Did you and Mr. Storms
have a bad breakup?

902
00:46:58.651 --> 00:47:00.612
- Yes. they did.

903
00:47:01.863 --> 00:47:05.116
You know. he's gay and
he left her for a man.

904
00:47:05.158 --> 00:47:07.952
Even his father cut
him out of his will

905
00:47:07.994 --> 00:47:09.996
because of their situation.

906
00:47:10.997 --> 00:47:14.834
- To clarify. Evan and
I departed his friends.

907
00:47:14.876 --> 00:47:17.504
I knew of his lifestyle
well before we got married.

908
00:47:17.545 --> 00:47:21.466
So there were no issues there.
We had an open marriage.

909
00:47:21.508 --> 00:47:23.635
We agreed that since
he wanna be with men

910
00:47:23.677 --> 00:47:27.013
and we simply got married
as a coverup for his father.

911
00:47:27.055 --> 00:47:29.099
it would be best that we
just remained as friends.

912
00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:32.185
And I supported Evan
in every way possible.

913
00:47:32.227 --> 00:47:34.646
So. no. there were no issues.

914
00:47:36.272 --> 00:47:38.400
- Well. if you could
think of anything else.

915
00:47:38.441 --> 00:47:39.776
please give us a call.

916
00:47:39.818 --> 00:47:41.111
Here's a card for you both.

917
00:47:41.152 --> 00:47:42.696
- [Philomena] Thank you.
- You welcome.

918
00:47:42.737 --> 00:47:46.449
- Well. I really don't know of
anything else I can tell you.

919
00:47:46.491 --> 00:47:47.701
but you may wanna check in

920
00:47:47.742 --> 00:47:49.077
with some of the
men he was dating

921
00:47:49.119 --> 00:47:52.539
'cause. you know. a lot of
people don't like the gays.

922
00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:55.667
- That gives no one a reason
to wanna harm a innocent child

923
00:47:55.709 --> 00:47:57.043
or a gay man.

924
00:47:57.085 --> 00:48:00.046
If you think of anything
else. gimme a call.

925
00:48:01.548 --> 00:48:03.216
You both have a blessed day.

926
00:48:03.258 --> 00:48:07.554
And by the way. nice office
just to be a secretary.

927
00:48:07.595 --> 00:48:08.680
- May I walk out with you.

928

932
00:48:16.646 --> 00:48:17.897
- [Detective Smith] Yes?

933
00:48:17.939 --> 00:48:18.982
- [Philomena] I have
a question for you.

934
00:48:19.024 --> 00:48:21.943
- Secretary? I

935
00:48:21.985 --> 00:48:24.821
I earned all of
this. This is mine.

936
00:48:24.863 --> 00:48:26.281
Secretary. my butt.

937
00:48:31.786 --> 00:48:32.537
Hello.

938
00:48:33.955 --> 00:48:37.751
Yes. I need to cancel all of
Rainey Storms' appointments.

939
00:48:37.792 --> 00:48:39.627
She will not be coming
in anytime soon.

940
00:48:40.962 --> 00:48:43.423
if I have anything
to do with it.

941
00:48:43.465 --> 00:48:44.632
(upbeat music)

942
00:48:44.674 --> 00:48:48.303
- [Melisende] Rainey. Rainey.

943
00:48:51.556 --> 00:48:52.349

944
00:48:54.851 --> 00:48:56.311

00:49:00.648 --> 00:49:04.986
What is going on and how
long you been like this?

946
00:49:05.028 --> 00:49:07.280
You look a mess.

947
00:49:08.406 --> 00:49:10.700
Girl. how many bottles
of wine you had?

948
00:49:15.372 --> 00:49:21.169
- Leave me alone. I don't
wanna be bothered. Okay?

949
00:49:21.211 --> 00:49:23.338
And how did you
get in this house?

950
00:49:25.924 --> 00:49:30.011
- For one. when the last
time you took a shower?

951
00:49:31.137 --> 00:49:34.641
And how long you been
in this mess. girl?

952
00:49:34.683 --> 00:49:36.184
'Cause you stink.

953
00:49:38.812 --> 00:49:41.523
- Shower? For what?

954
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:45.360
- [Melisende] Oh. my God.

955
00:49:45.402 --> 00:49:49.114
- The world is
over for me. Okay?

956
00:49:49.155 --> 00:49:51.783
It ended on May 29th

957
00:49:51.825 --> 00:49:56.371
when your fake God decided
to take away Evan and Logan

958
00:49:56.413 --> 00:49:57.831
without a cause.

959
00:49:57.872 --> 00:50:02.460
So just leave and
don't come back. Okay?

960
00:50:03.545 --> 00:50:07.966
- No. I'm not leaving
you like this.

961
00:50:08.008 --> 00:50:11.803
Look. Rainey. I know. okay?

962
00:50:11.845 --> 00:50:13.847
I know all of this is wrong

963
00:50:13.888 --> 00:50:16.850
and none of this
should have happened.

964
00:50:16.891 --> 00:50:19.352
But I do know Evan and Logan

965
00:50:19.394 --> 00:50:22.564
would not wanna see
you like this at all.

966
00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:28.278
- How the hell could
you possibly know

967
00:50:28.319 --> 00:50:29.571
what I'm going through?

968
00:50:30.947 --> 00:50:32.073
Did you lose a brother?

969
00:50:35.618 --> 00:50:37.078
Or a child?

970
00:50:39.205 --> 00:50:44.461
No. So stop telling
me how to feel.

971
00:50:44.502 --> 00:50:45.879
Just get out.

972
00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:48.381
Leave.
- No. Rainey.

973
00:50:48.423 --> 00:50:52.385
I am not leaving
you like this. Okay?

974
00:50:53.553 --> 00:50:57.724
You are my sister.
my best friend.

975
00:50:59.434 --> 00:51:05.106
So I'm gonna go downstairs and
fix us both a cup of coffee.

976
00:51:05.148 --> 00:51:06.608
I'm gonna come up.

977
00:51:06.649 --> 00:51:11.196
run you some bath water and
put you some clothes on. okay?

978
00:51:13.198 --> 00:51:17.243
- What you could do
is drop your key off

979
00:51:17.285 --> 00:51:18.828
on the way out the door.

980
00:51:20.121 --> 00:51:21.456
Leave.
- No.

981
00:51:21.498 --> 00:51:23.083
- Get out. Just go.
- No.

982
00:51:23.124 --> 00:51:26.378
I'm not leaving you
like this. okay?

983
00:51:27.545 --> 00:51:31.091
You can cuss. you can
scream. do whatever you want.

984
00:51:31.132 --> 00:51:33.468
but I'm not leaving
you in this state.

985
00:51:34.969 --> 00:51:37.889
- Get out. Get out.
- Oh. my God.

986
00:51:37.931 --> 00:51:39.099
Like I said...
- Get out.

987
00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:40.517
- I'm gonna go around
you some bath water

988
00:51:40.558 --> 00:51:43.269
and you gon' put some clothes
on 'cause you look a mess.

989
00:51:43.311 --> 00:51:44.312
- Get out. Stupid.

990
00:51:48.858 --> 00:51:51.528
(Rainey screams)

991
00:51:53.196 --> 00:51:55.240
Your days are numbered.

992
00:51:57.075 --> 00:51:59.369
Whoever did this
to Logan and Evan.

993
00:52:01.788 --> 00:52:04.749
you have not seen this
side of Rainey Storms.

994
00:52:07.002 --> 00:52:09.879
I am gonna make
you pay for this.

995
00:52:11.131 --> 00:52:12.757
- What's wrong?

996
00:52:12.799 --> 00:52:13.883
I heard you saying something

997
00:52:13.925 --> 00:52:16.136
about somebody was
gonna pay for something.

998
00:52:16.177 --> 00:52:16.886
You okay?

999
00:52:18.513 --> 00:52:23.685
- Whoever did that to Logan
and Evan. yeah. they gon' pay.

1000
00:52:26.187 --> 00:52:29.149
- The detectives are
going to find out

1001
00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:30.942
the scums who did this to them.

1002
00:52:32.152 --> 00:52:32.944
Okay?

1003
00:52:34.154 --> 00:52:36.823
- The detectives aren't
gonna do anything.

1004
00:52:36.865 --> 00:52:40.201
Just two black men dead.
less they gotta deal with.

1005
00:52:41.369 --> 00:52:43.038
But you do have one thing right

1006
00:52:43.079 --> 00:52:44.497
- Mm. what's that?

1007
00:52:44.539 --> 00:52:46.416
- It's time for
me to take charge.

1008
00:52:47.709 --> 00:52:50.128
Yeah. it's time for Rainey
to come back to the surface.

1009
00:52:50.170 --> 00:52:53.840
- Yes. Now that's my girl.

1010
00:52:53.882 --> 00:52:56.009
Now let's go put on some clothes

1011
00:52:56.051 --> 00:52:58.470
and go pop up on
that Trudy Brown.

1012
00:52:58.511 --> 00:53:02.057
Look. I was there the
other day getting your file

1013
00:53:02.098 --> 00:53:03.266
so I can call your clients

1014
00:53:03.308 --> 00:53:05.602
to let them know
you'll be back soon.

1015
00:53:05.643 --> 00:53:08.396
and she was in there like
she was running the place.

1016
00:53:08.438 --> 00:53:09.898
I don't trust her. Rainey.

1017
00:53:11.232 --> 00:53:13.318
- She say the same
thing about you.

1018
00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:15.362
- [Melisende] Oh. word? Mm.

1019
00:53:15.403 --> 00:53:17.155
- But all that stops today.

1020
00:53:17.197 --> 00:53:18.823
- And will.

1021
00:53:18.865 --> 00:53:21.242
- Rainey Storms is back.

1022
00:53:26.122 --> 00:53:27.874
- Hey. Rainey.

1023
00:53:27.916 --> 00:53:31.252
I was expecting you back so
soon. I'd have been prepared.

1024
00:53:31.294 --> 00:53:32.754
- I bet you didn't.

1025
00:53:32.796 --> 00:53:37.467
Is that why you sitting your
nasty behind in my chair?

1026
00:53:37.509 --> 00:53:40.053
Get that heck outta my office.

1027
00:53:40.095 --> 00:53:41.304
And while you at it.

1028
00:53:41.346 --> 00:53:43.390
call the exterminator
and the cleaning crew.

1029
00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:47.686
- I'm sorry.
Exterminator for what?

1030
00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:53.274
And cleaning crew for what?
This place is spotless.

1031
00:53:54.567 --> 00:53:57.904
- I don't know what you left
behind with the way you live.

1032
00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:00.573
And while you at it.

1033
00:54:00.615 --> 00:54:02.701
find the number for
the custom design.

1034
00:54:02.742 --> 00:54:05.745
so I can order me a
new chair and desk

1035
00:54:05.787 --> 00:54:10.375
because I would never
sat where you sat.

1036
00:54:12.627 --> 00:54:14.254
- Wow.

1037
00:54:14.295 --> 00:54:19.426
You know. a thank you
woulda been in order.

1038
00:54:21.302 --> 00:54:22.429
As you know...

1039
00:54:26.141 --> 00:54:27.934
Wow. Really?

1040
00:54:31.062 --> 00:54:32.522
You know. Rainey.

1041
00:54:32.564 --> 00:54:36.860
it was me that kept this place
in order while you were home.

1042
00:54:36.901 --> 00:54:40.655
It was me that kept
your clients happy

1043
00:54:40.697 --> 00:54:42.991
while you were at home grieving

1044
00:54:43.033 --> 00:54:44.701
over the loss of
your loved ones.

1045
00:54:47.203 --> 00:54:49.581
- I bet you did keep them happy

1046
00:54:49.622 --> 00:54:54.294
by spreading your
legs both ways.

1047
00:54:54.336 --> 00:54:55.337
- Wow.

1048
00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:02.177
I'm glad to see you and
your attitude is back.

1049
00:55:02.218 --> 00:55:05.263
You would think the time
away from the office

1050
00:55:05.305 --> 00:55:08.683
would maybe.
perhaps. changed you.

1051
00:55:09.976 --> 00:55:14.356
or even. possibly. you
may have found Jesus.

1052
00:55:16.816 --> 00:55:18.026
but I guess not.

1053
00:55:19.194 --> 00:55:24.366
It's obvious the devil
still lives within you.

1054
00:55:27.285 --> 00:55:30.955
- Once this term of
the will expires.

1055
00:55:30.997 --> 00:55:36.002
you who will be out the
minute the clock strikes.

1056
00:55:36.044 --> 00:55:36.920
Bye-bye.

1057
00:55:36.961 --> 00:55:39.422
(upbeat music)

1058
00:55:53.019 --> 00:55:55.605
- So. I was surprised
when you called me

1059
00:55:55.647 --> 00:55:57.565
to come pick you
up for lunch today.

1060
00:55:58.858 --> 00:56:02.112
How's everything? I know
Trudy was shocked. Mm-hmm.

1061
00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:05.407
- I had no choice.

1062
00:56:05.448 --> 00:56:06.783
After you played that
dirty little trick on me

1063
00:56:06.825 --> 00:56:10.245
and handcuffed me to you and
dragged me out the house.

1064
00:56:10.286 --> 00:56:13.373
and only released me
if I agreed to go out.

1065
00:56:13.415 --> 00:56:16.042
And yes. Trudy was surprised.

1066
00:56:16.084 --> 00:56:18.712
I had to call the cleaning
crew. the exterminator.

1067
00:56:18.753 --> 00:56:21.381
and I had to order a new
custom chair and desk.

1068
00:56:21.423 --> 00:56:24.801
- What? Girl. you
back for real. Okay?

1069
00:56:26.177 --> 00:56:28.430
And that's all that matter.

1070
00:56:28.471 --> 00:56:30.682
You know. I know
it's been hard. sis.

1071
00:56:30.724 --> 00:56:34.144
and I know everything's
been tough.

1072
00:56:34.185 --> 00:56:37.188
but you know. I just did
what God instructed me to do.

1073
00:56:38.523 --> 00:56:40.316
- So your fake
God that you serve

1074
00:56:40.358 --> 00:56:41.985
told you to handcuff me

1075
00:56:43.111 --> 00:56:46.906
and drag me out to a restaurant
only to have a salad.

1076
00:56:46.948 --> 00:56:50.744
- See. actually. I
helped him out a little.

1077
00:56:50.785 --> 00:56:53.747
See. I use my same trick
that I use on David.

1078
00:56:53.788 --> 00:56:56.583
Cindy and um. oh.
John or whoever.

1079
00:56:56.624 --> 00:56:58.418
when I want them to
stay in my bed. honey.

1080
00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:01.421
until morning or until I
get finished with them.

1081
00:57:01.463 --> 00:57:04.549
- I can't with you.
(Melisende laughing)

1082
00:57:06.176 --> 00:57:07.510
Don't look. girl.

1083
00:57:07.552 --> 00:57:10.513
They got this fine. chocolate.

1084
00:57:10.555 --> 00:57:14.976
delicious. baby. meal of a
snack staring over there at me.

1085
00:57:15.018 --> 00:57:16.519
- [Rainey] Mm-mm. if
you walk over there.

1086
00:57:16.561 --> 00:57:18.563
I will flip all this
food on your lap.

1087
00:57:20.023 --> 00:57:22.609
- [Melisende] Oh. they
ain't gon' mess up

1088
00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:24.444
my expensive food. baby.

1089
00:57:24.486 --> 00:57:26.488
I need him to think
that I got money.

1090
00:57:33.453 --> 00:57:36.456
- Good evening. beautiful queen.

1091
00:57:36.498 --> 00:57:37.874
I seen you from across the way

1092
00:57:37.916 --> 00:57:39.918
and wanted to come
over. introduce myself.

1093
00:57:39.959 --> 00:57:40.669
How's the food?

1094
00:57:44.756 --> 00:57:48.635
- Baby. it's fine.
Okay? Just like you.

1095
00:57:48.677 --> 00:57:51.346
And if you haven't noticed.

1096
00:57:51.388 --> 00:57:53.640
there's two queens
sitting at this table.

1097
00:57:54.683 --> 00:57:58.853
- You're right. I stand
corrected. Two queens.

1098
00:57:58.895 --> 00:58:00.188
But anyway. I see you over here

1099
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:02.399
just digging through your salad.

1100
00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:03.983
I wanted to ask if
you needed anything.

1101
00:58:04.025 --> 00:58:06.152
if everything was
okay. you know?

1102
00:58:06.194 --> 00:58:08.947
- Everything is fine. Thank you.

1103
00:58:10.031 --> 00:58:11.574
- Really. Rainey.

1104
00:58:11.616 --> 00:58:16.371
- Look. queen. I know
what you going through.

1105
00:58:16.413 --> 00:58:18.665
I know what you
experiencing. but guess what?

1106
00:58:18.707 --> 00:58:21.167
Everything's gonna
work in your favor.

1107
00:58:21.209 --> 00:58:23.336
Even through the darkness.
you still gonna shine.

1108
00:58:23.378 --> 00:58:25.338
Keep that in mind. All right?

1109
00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:26.589
- So. what are you.

1110
00:58:26.631 --> 00:58:29.634
some street hustling
pastor waiting tables?

1111
00:58:29.676 --> 00:58:32.303
And want a hand out
a cash or something?

1112
00:58:32.345 --> 00:58:33.555
- Oh. know what?

1113
00:58:33.596 --> 00:58:36.433
Just please excuse her.
She been through a lot.

1114
00:58:36.474 --> 00:58:39.144
She been through a
lot these past days.

1115
00:58:39.185 --> 00:58:41.062
- So you queens sisters?

1116
00:58:42.105 --> 00:58:43.732
- No. we're best friends.

1117
00:58:43.773 --> 00:58:45.817
but we will stomp
you out like we are

1118
00:58:45.859 --> 00:58:48.194
if you don't remove
yourself from this table.

1119
00:58:50.739 --> 00:58:54.701
- Wow. Please excuse her. Okay?

1120
00:58:55.535 --> 00:58:57.829
- It's fine. I understand.

1121
00:58:58.955 --> 00:59:02.500
I see all the pain and
hurt in your beauty.

1122
00:59:02.542 --> 00:59:03.877
But you know what?

1123
00:59:03.918 --> 00:59:06.171
Beauty is of the
eyes of the beholder

1124
00:59:06.212 --> 00:59:07.213
who only seeks that.

1125
00:59:07.255 --> 00:59:08.631
But the pain.

1126
00:59:09.924 --> 00:59:13.136
that's for true soul seekers
who see beyond the beauty.

1127
00:59:13.178 --> 00:59:14.637
Understand what I'm saying?

1128
00:59:15.555 --> 00:59:17.515
- Man. that's deep.

1129
00:59:17.557 --> 00:59:21.353
So. um. would you like
to join us for lunch?

1130
00:59:21.394 --> 00:59:23.313
- Uh. no. thank you.

1131
00:59:23.355 --> 00:59:27.901
But what I will do. I'll take
care of you queen's food.

1132
00:59:27.942 --> 00:59:31.404
and I give you some of the
finest wine I have here

1133
00:59:31.446 --> 00:59:32.364
in my establishment.

1134
00:59:34.699 --> 00:59:36.159
On the house.

1135
00:59:36.201 --> 00:59:38.745
- [Melisende] Well. thanks.
- You're very welcome.

1136
00:59:40.830 --> 00:59:45.460
And Rainey's a
very powerful name.

1137
00:59:45.502 --> 00:59:46.586
- It is.

1138
00:59:46.628 --> 00:59:48.171
- And I would like
to talk more to you

1139
00:59:48.213 --> 00:59:49.756
and see more about you

1140
00:59:49.798 --> 00:59:52.425
and actually learn
more about your name.

1141
00:59:52.467 --> 00:59:53.760
where it come from
and who you are.

1142
00:59:53.802 --> 00:59:56.179
So gimme a call whenever
you get a chance

1143
00:59:56.221 --> 00:59:58.640
or whenever you need
someone to talk to.

1144
01:00:01.226 --> 01:00:02.727
- [Rainey] Okay.

1145
01:00:09.150 --> 01:00:10.443
- [Hudson] Have a
great meal. Okay?

1146
01:00:10.485 --> 01:00:11.653
- You too.

1147
01:00:15.657 --> 01:00:20.495
Girl. you are so rude. Okay?

1148
01:00:20.537 --> 01:00:23.790
First of all. that man
got money and business.

1149
01:00:23.832 --> 01:00:27.335
And to top it all off. honey.
he got big. big. big feet.

1150
01:00:29.045 --> 01:00:31.506
- I'm not interested
in that man's money.

1151
01:00:31.548 --> 01:00:35.218
his business or his big feet.

1152
01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:37.595
The only thing I'm
focused on right now

1153
01:00:37.637 --> 01:00:41.307
is finding out who killed
my brother and son.

1154
01:00:41.349 --> 01:00:44.894
Now until you can produce
me that. nothing matters.

1155
01:00:44.936 --> 01:00:46.521
- Okay. Rainey.
- [Rainey] You know what?

1156
01:00:46.563 --> 01:00:47.647
I'm ready to go.

1157
01:00:47.689 --> 01:00:49.065
* No matter if the
lights go out

1158
01:00:49.107 --> 01:00:50.525
- We should've got-
- [Rainey] I'm ready to go.

1159
01:00:50.567 --> 01:00:52.861
- [Melisende] Oh. my gosh.

1160
01:00:52.902 --> 01:00:55.572

- How you doing?

1167
01:01:07.709 --> 01:01:09.878
I see you put that business
card in use I gave you.

1168
01:01:09.919 --> 01:01:12.505
- Mm. well. you did
stress that I can call you

1169
01:01:12.547 --> 01:01:14.674
if I ever need anything.
- I did.

1170
01:01:14.716 --> 01:01:17.802
- So I did. And plus.
I forgot my wallet.

1171
01:01:17.844 --> 01:01:19.346
Thanks for bringing it back.

1172
01:01:19.387 --> 01:01:20.555
- Of course.

1173
01:01:20.597 --> 01:01:21.723
- [Rainey] Come on in.

1174
01:01:26.311 --> 01:01:28.855
Okay. why don't you go
ahead and have a seat

1175
01:01:28.897 --> 01:01:30.023
before the food gets cold.

1176
01:01:30.065 --> 01:01:32.776
- Oh. you have a
beautiful place here.

1177
01:01:32.817 --> 01:01:34.694
- Thank you.
- Lemme. uh.

1178
01:01:34.736 --> 01:01:36.237
lemme pull your
chair out for you.

1179
01:01:36.279 --> 01:01:38.782
- Oh. Thank you. Sweet.

1180
01:01:39.783 --> 01:01:42.827
- Of course. It's
the way I do things.

1181
01:01:42.869 --> 01:01:44.621
It's only one Hudson Wheeler.

1182
01:01:44.662 --> 01:01:46.373
- [Rainey] Oh. is that right?

1183
01:01:46.414 --> 01:01:52.671
- Absolutely. Dinner smells
amazing. You made this?

1184
01:01:52.712 --> 01:01:53.421
- [Rainey] Mm-hmm.
- Oh. I'm impressed.

1185
01:01:53.463 --> 01:01:54.381
- [Rainey] Good.

1186
01:01:54.422 --> 01:01:55.382
- [Hudson] I'm ready to dig in.

1187
01:01:55.423 --> 01:01:57.717
- So I felt like I owed you.

1188
01:01:57.759 --> 01:01:59.886
you know. since I haven't
been that kind to you

1189
01:01:59.928 --> 01:02:02.263
for a whole entire month.

1190
01:02:02.305 --> 01:02:06.017
- Well. that's kind of
you. but you don't owe me.

1191
01:02:06.059 --> 01:02:07.560
That debt's already been paid.

1192
01:02:07.602 --> 01:02:10.980
It was paid when you called
me. my queen. You know this.

1193
01:02:11.022 --> 01:02:15.235
- Why do you keep
calling me my queen?

1194
01:02:15.276 --> 01:02:16.903
I'm yours or something?

1195
01:02:16.945 --> 01:02:21.408
- Absolutely. That's my
target. To get you to be mine.

1196
01:02:21.449 --> 01:02:22.742
Isn't that what we here for?

1197
01:02:22.784 --> 01:02:24.786
'Cause that's what I'm here for.

1198
01:02:24.828 --> 01:02:27.539
I wouldn't have
it any other way.

1199
01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:28.373
- Okay.

1200
01:02:30.583 --> 01:02:33.545
So you enjoying your meal?

1201
01:02:34.671 --> 01:02:36.381
- Oh. without a doubt.

1202
01:02:36.423 --> 01:02:41.386
But. um. I see there's
no dessert on the table.

1203
01:02:41.428 --> 01:02:43.346
so I figured it must be you.

1204
01:02:47.142 --> 01:02:49.060
- I'll see what I
can work up then.

1205
01:02:53.690 --> 01:02:55.442
(Rainey laughing)

1206
01:02:55.483 --> 01:02:59.404
I have not laugh this
hard and a very long time.

1207
01:02:59.446 --> 01:03:00.739
- [Hudson] Mm-hmm

1208
01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:03.616
- Thank you for accepting
my invitation to dinner.

1209
01:03:03.658 --> 01:03:05.618
- Of course.

1210
01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:08.413
Believe me. it was
all well worth it.

1211
01:03:09.789 --> 01:03:13.126
Dinner was exceptionally divine.

1212
01:03:13.168 --> 01:03:14.294
I haven't had a meal like that

1213
01:03:14.336 --> 01:03:17.339
since Grandma Pearl's
Sunday dinners.

1214
01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:19.132
Where'd you learn
to cook like that?

1215
01:03:19.174 --> 01:03:21.509
- My mother. my grandmother.

1216
01:03:21.551 --> 01:03:24.763
I just used to sit in the
kitchen and watch them.

1217
01:03:24.804 --> 01:03:27.015
I always wanted my
own fancy restaurant.

1218
01:03:28.183 --> 01:03:29.642
- So why didn't you go for it?

1219
01:03:29.684 --> 01:03:31.227
Because if those meals

1220
01:03:31.269 --> 01:03:33.688
anything like the
meals you cook tonight.

1221
01:03:33.730 --> 01:03:35.982
I would be in there every day.

1222
01:03:36.024 --> 01:03:38.151
I'm talking 24/7.

1223
01:03:39.235 --> 01:03:43.198
- Well. I got pregnant
at a very early age

1224
01:03:43.239 --> 01:03:46.368
and my father had
other plans for me.

1225
01:03:46.409 --> 01:03:47.952
He wanted me to follow
in his footsteps

1226
01:03:47.994 --> 01:03:49.788
and become an attorney

1227
01:03:49.829 --> 01:03:53.291
since my brother
decided to drop it all.

1228
01:03:53.333 --> 01:03:54.292
Long story.

1229
01:03:55.627 --> 01:03:59.798
- Long story? I mean. I can
listen to you all night.

1230
01:03:59.839 --> 01:04:02.926
Like I said. I am a
very good listener.

1231
01:04:02.967 --> 01:04:05.970
- [Rainey] Mm.

1232
01:04:08.848 --> 01:04:12.060
- So who's in the picture?

1233
01:04:12.102 --> 01:04:15.855
Is it ex-husband. current
boyfriend. current...

1234
01:04:15.897 --> 01:04:17.315
Then what's going on? Son?

1235
01:04:18.274 --> 01:04:23.446
- Mm. No. No husband
or ex-husband.

1236
01:04:24.489 --> 01:04:28.660
That's actually my brother
Evan and my son Logan.

1237
01:04:31.079 --> 01:04:36.251
- Oh. I am so sorry. This is
my first time seeing them.

1238
01:04:39.004 --> 01:04:40.922
I truly apologize about that.

1239
01:04:41.756 --> 01:04:42.924
- It's okay.

1240
01:04:44.926 --> 01:04:46.678
- Are you okay? Did I
say something wrong?

1241
01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:48.763
If I did. I. I. I. I apologize.

1242
01:04:48.805 --> 01:04:50.598
- Oh. no. no.

1243
01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:54.686
Just looking at their
picture just brings me back

1244
01:04:56.062 --> 01:05:01.234
to. um. everything that
happened six months ago.

1245
01:05:02.527 --> 01:05:04.946
right here in this house.

1246
01:05:05.864 --> 01:05:08.575
- Everything happened
in this house?

1247
01:05:09.784 --> 01:05:10.994
I had no idea.

1248
01:05:12.954 --> 01:05:16.875
- Yeah. um. the
detectives believe

1249
01:05:16.916 --> 01:05:19.169
that it happened
here in this house.

1250
01:05:19.210 --> 01:05:19.961
So...

1251
01:05:22.339 --> 01:05:26.134
- Listen. Rainey.
you're my queen.

1252
01:05:27.594 --> 01:05:29.971
When I tell you I won't
let anything happen to you.

1253
01:05:30.013 --> 01:05:31.681
I mean it.

1254
01:05:31.723 --> 01:05:35.769
I truly believe I was sent
here to North Carolina by God

1255
01:05:35.810 --> 01:05:39.189
to protect you and
to look after you

1256
01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:40.690
and to make you my wife.

1257
01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:44.694
You won't have any more
worries while I'm here.

1258
01:05:50.909 --> 01:05:55.330
- Thank you. but I don't
think God will bless me.

1259
01:05:56.623 --> 01:06:00.710
But I do know that someone
sent you from soul.

1260
01:06:03.630 --> 01:06:06.591
- I just. I just can't believe
all this took place here.

1261
01:06:06.633 --> 01:06:11.554
Listen. no one will ever
hurt you again. Nobody.

1262
01:06:13.098 --> 01:06:15.642
You're my queen and
I will marry you

1263
01:06:15.684 --> 01:06:16.768
and I'll show you that.

1264
01:06:18.603 --> 01:06:21.022
You're the most beautiful
person I ever seen.

1265
01:06:22.357 --> 01:06:24.150
And the moment I
laid the eyes on you.

1266
01:06:24.192 --> 01:06:26.194
I knew you was for me.

1267
01:06:26.236 --> 01:06:31.032
And I want that feeling to
be forever. And it will be.

1268
01:06:32.325 --> 01:06:33.702
I'mma make sure you heal.

1269
01:06:38.957 --> 01:06:40.792
(detective knocking)

1270
01:06:40.834 --> 01:06:43.712
- Oh. this has to
be my nosy friend.

1271
01:06:44.921 --> 01:06:46.297
Lemme get rid of her. Okay?

1272
01:06:46.339 --> 01:06:47.716
- All right. That's fine.

1273
01:06:55.056 --> 01:06:56.516
- Hello. Can I come in?

1274
01:06:56.558 --> 01:06:58.560
- Uh. what brings
you by. Detective?

1275
01:06:58.601 --> 01:07:00.687
Have you found who
murdered my family?

1276
01:07:00.729 --> 01:07:04.357
- No. not yet. I came by
earlier. but you wasn't here.

1277
01:07:04.399 --> 01:07:05.775
So I went to see your secretary.

1278
01:07:05.817 --> 01:07:08.903
and she said you went on
lunch. but you never came back.

1279
01:07:08.945 --> 01:07:10.572
So I came by your home today.

1280
01:07:13.074 --> 01:07:15.910
- Yeah. This is my good
friend. Mr. Hudson Wheeler.

1281
01:07:15.952 --> 01:07:17.912
And he's just here
for moral support.

1282
01:07:17.954 --> 01:07:19.039
- Nice to meet you.

1283
01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:20.707
- Nice to meet you as well.

1284
01:07:20.749 --> 01:07:22.042
- Okay.

1285
01:07:22.083 --> 01:07:24.044
Well. Ms. Storms.
here's a few mugshots

1286
01:07:24.085 --> 01:07:25.295
I would like for you
to take a look at.

1287
01:07:25.337 --> 01:07:28.214
You let me know if any
of 'em look familiar.

1288
01:07:28.256 --> 01:07:29.924
- I truly don't understand

1289
01:07:29.966 --> 01:07:31.593
why I'm looking at
pictures of criminals.

1290
01:07:31.634 --> 01:07:33.720
I don't associate myself
with people like that.

1291
01:07:33.762 --> 01:07:36.264
- Well. Ms. Storms. you
are a powerful attorney.

1292
01:07:37.515 --> 01:07:40.727
And maybe it was a enemy
or someone that you knew.

1293
01:07:40.769 --> 01:07:44.564
So. Mr. Wheeler. did you know
Ms. Storms' brother. Evan?

1294
01:07:44.606 --> 01:07:48.860
- No. I did not. I'm
just here for support.

1295
01:07:48.902 --> 01:07:50.445
Just as Ms. Storms
stated before.

1296
01:07:51.654 --> 01:07:53.073
just here being a good
friend through a rough time.

1297
01:07:53.114 --> 01:07:54.574
you know?

1298
01:07:54.616 --> 01:07:57.077
- Ms. Storms. does any of these
people look familiar to you

1299
01:07:57.118 --> 01:07:58.286
in these pictures?

1300
01:07:59.287 --> 01:08:01.623
- Why do you have
pictures of my exes

1301
01:08:01.664 --> 01:08:04.000
or my brother's friends?

1302
01:08:04.042 --> 01:08:05.293
- We have to check out everyone

1303
01:08:05.335 --> 01:08:06.795
that knew you and your brother.

1304
01:08:07.962 --> 01:08:10.215
- Well. you're looking
in the wrong place.

1305
01:08:10.256 --> 01:08:13.760
These people loved me.
love Logan and love Evan.

1306
01:08:13.802 --> 01:08:16.221
I mean. I. I don't understand.

1307
01:08:16.262 --> 01:08:18.431
- Well. Ms. Storms. I have
to check out everyone.

1308
01:08:18.473 --> 01:08:20.141
Do you have any
enemies as clients

1309
01:08:20.183 --> 01:08:23.603
that will want to bring
harm to you or your family?

1310
01:08:23.645 --> 01:08:25.105
- No.

1311
01:08:25.146 --> 01:08:28.108
I mean. why aren't you out
there talking to people.

1312
01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:30.985
checking fingerprints
or hair samples

1313
01:08:31.027 --> 01:08:32.904
for the forensic reports?

1314
01:08:32.946 --> 01:08:36.783
- Ms. Storms. I'm doing all
I can to solve this case.

1315
01:08:36.825 --> 01:08:40.870
Believe me. I will not
rest until I find the scums

1316
01:08:40.912 --> 01:08:42.038
who did this.

1317
01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:43.707
- That's crazy.

1318
01:08:43.748 --> 01:08:47.293
I don't believe my
brother didn't try to
save my son's life.

1319
01:08:47.335 --> 01:08:50.046
I mean. he was a black
belt in martial arts

1320
01:08:50.088 --> 01:08:51.631
and he taught it.

1321
01:08:51.673 --> 01:08:53.842
So I know that there
was a struggle.

1322
01:08:54.843 --> 01:08:57.012
- Ms. Storms. even the
highest can be overtaken

1323
01:08:57.053 --> 01:08:58.680
when a weapon is involved.

1324
01:08:58.722 --> 01:09:00.557
- So you believe there
was more than one?

1325
01:09:00.598 --> 01:09:02.017
- Yes. I do.

1326
01:09:02.058 --> 01:09:04.144
And that's why I
need to know everyone

1327
01:09:04.185 --> 01:09:06.396
that you believe had a motive.

1328
01:09:06.438 --> 01:09:07.981
- Well. believe me.

1329
01:09:08.023 --> 01:09:12.318
if I had so much of a whisper
of who it was that did it.

1330
01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:16.990
I wouldn't need the police.
the detective or the FBI.

1331
01:09:17.032 --> 01:09:20.160
because when it
rains. it storms.

1332
01:09:20.201 --> 01:09:23.079
- I understand how
you feel. Ms. Storms.

1333
01:09:23.121 --> 01:09:25.957
But let us do our job.
They will slip up.

1334
01:09:27.292 --> 01:09:31.421
- Then do your job
before I do it for you.

1335
01:09:37.052 --> 01:09:38.303
- Please don't take it personal.

1336
01:09:38.345 --> 01:09:40.305
I'm quite sure she
didn't mean it.

1337
01:09:40.347 --> 01:09:42.640
- I know. but I
believe she meant that.

1338
01:09:42.682 --> 01:09:47.354
Reading Rainey's history. she's
the last besides her aunt.

1339
01:09:47.395 --> 01:09:51.024
Try to calm her down. We don't
need another body showing up.

1340
01:09:51.066 --> 01:09:53.026
- Thank you. Lemme
walk you to the door.

1341
01:09:53.068 --> 01:09:54.235
- [Detective Smith] Thank you.

1342
01:09:58.615 --> 01:10:01.868
* Baby. you got me going crazy

1343
01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:04.120
* Wanna be you lady

1344
01:10:04.162 --> 01:10:05.372
- [Rainey] This is nice.

1345
01:10:05.413 --> 01:10:07.165
- [Hudson] Thank you. I
know. Something small.

1346
01:10:07.207 --> 01:10:09.584
I know it's the
thought that counts.

1347
01:10:09.626 --> 01:10:11.252
- [Rainey] Pay attention. I see.

1348
01:10:11.294 --> 01:10:13.213
- [Hudson] I got you.
(music drowns out speaker)

1349
01:10:13.254 --> 01:10:14.381
- [Hudson] All the
things that I like.

1350
01:10:14.422 --> 01:10:17.217
- Yeah. Anything for my Rainey.

1351
01:10:17.258 --> 01:10:19.886
I mean. I know you
can whip up something

1352
01:10:19.928 --> 01:10:21.054
way better than this.

1353
01:10:21.096 --> 01:10:23.098
but I figured
it'll do right now.

1354
01:10:23.139 --> 01:10:27.185
- No. but it's still
nice. But I love to cook.

1355
01:10:27.227 --> 01:10:29.854
- Oh. really? Who
taught you how to cook?

1356
01:10:29.896 --> 01:10:31.690
- My mom.
- Your mom?

1357
01:10:31.731 --> 01:10:34.401
- Yeah. I used to
get up on a stool

1358
01:10:34.442 --> 01:10:38.071
and just watch her
in the kitchen.

1359
01:10:38.113 --> 01:10:39.447
- It's a beautiful story.

1360
01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:43.159
Now I really wanna taste
more of your cooking.

1361
01:10:43.201 --> 01:10:44.828
Gotta see what mom taught you.

1362
01:10:44.869 --> 01:10:46.287
- Mm. Yeah.

1363
01:10:46.329 --> 01:10:49.124
- Would you like some grapes?
I mean it's not many. but...

1364
01:10:49.165 --> 01:10:51.501
- Uh. maybe later.

1365
01:10:51.543 --> 01:10:55.630
- Oh. that was my romantic
moment of the day.

1366
01:10:55.672 --> 01:10:57.215
- That's okay.
- Feeding you grapes.

1367
01:10:57.257 --> 01:10:58.341
- Yes. Thank you.

1368
01:10:58.383 --> 01:10:59.592
- Like something
drinking instead or...

1369
01:10:59.634 --> 01:11:03.138
- No. You know what?
Actually. I wanna...

1370
01:11:03.179 --> 01:11:04.806
- What do you wanna do?
- I wanna take a walk.

1371
01:11:04.848 --> 01:11:05.724
- You wanna take a walk?

1372
01:11:05.765 --> 01:11:06.891
- Yeah.
- Let's walk. then.

1373
01:11:06.933 --> 01:11:08.059
- Okay.

1374
01:11:08.101 --> 01:11:11.104
(upbeat music)

1375
01:11:11.146 --> 01:11:12.397
- You okay?

1376
01:11:13.314 --> 01:11:14.566
We need to get you to the car.

1377
01:11:14.607 --> 01:11:17.068
- No. no. no. no.

1378
01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:18.361
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1379
01:11:18.403 --> 01:11:21.281
- [Hudson] I'mma take your
word for it. All right?

1380
01:11:21.322 --> 01:11:23.575
No. No. you know what? We
gonna get you to the car.

1381
01:11:23.616 --> 01:11:24.951
Let's get you to
the car. Come on.

1382
01:11:24.993 --> 01:11:26.411
- [Rainey] Are you sure?

1383
01:11:26.453 --> 01:11:28.371
- Yes. Yes. You can rest a
little bit. And we'll come back.

1384
01:11:28.413 --> 01:11:30.123
- No. no. no. no. I think-

1385
01:11:30.165 --> 01:11:31.291
- [Hudson] Let's go
to the car. Come on.

1386
01:11:31.332 --> 01:11:32.792
Come on. It's okay relax.

1387
01:11:34.044 --> 01:11:40.175
- Oh. where you been? I been
calling you for two weeks.

1388
01:11:40.216 --> 01:11:42.677
I'm surprised you
finally answer me.

1389
01:11:43.762 --> 01:11:45.472
So please don't tell
me you went back

1390
01:11:45.513 --> 01:11:47.807
into that depression
mode again. huh?

1391
01:11:47.849 --> 01:11:50.810
After everything it took
for me to get you out of it.

1392
01:11:50.852 --> 01:11:53.438
- If you would take a
breath. I will tell you.

1393
01:11:54.773 --> 01:11:55.815
- Okay.

1394
01:11:55.857 --> 01:11:59.861
So what got my best
friend going MIA

1395
01:12:01.154 --> 01:12:03.156
and had me at the
detective's office

1396
01:12:03.198 --> 01:12:05.200
telling them you was missing?

1397
01:12:05.241 --> 01:12:06.910
- Are you serious?

1398
01:12:06.951 --> 01:12:08.620
- [Melisende] I mean. what
did you expect me to do

1399
01:12:08.661 --> 01:12:11.331
after everything
that done happened?

1400
01:12:11.373 --> 01:12:12.290
- Calm down.

1401
01:12:12.332 --> 01:12:13.333
- [Melisende] Shoot.

1402
01:12:13.375 --> 01:12:14.834
- And lemme tell
you what God did.

1403
01:12:14.876 --> 01:12:19.923
- Okay. okay. okay. What?
God? What you mean God?

1404
01:12:21.341 --> 01:12:23.968
Did they find out what
happened to Evan and Logan?

1405
01:12:24.010 --> 01:12:27.055
- No. Not yet. And yes. God.

1406
01:12:28.181 --> 01:12:30.392
I never thought I could
be this happy again.

1407
01:12:31.893 --> 01:12:34.020
- Girl. I'm just.
I'm just saying.

1408
01:12:34.062 --> 01:12:35.230
You got saved or something?

1409
01:12:35.271 --> 01:12:39.359
Because the last time. I know.

1410
01:12:39.401 --> 01:12:42.946
you and God was not
on any speaking terms.

1411
01:12:42.987 --> 01:12:47.534
or should I say you and God
was not on any speaking terms.

1412
01:12:49.744 --> 01:12:54.249
- Listen. do you remember that
new restaurant you took me to

1413
01:12:54.290 --> 01:12:55.542
about a month ago?

1414
01:12:55.583 --> 01:13:00.046
- Mm. Yes. Girl. you did
something to that man?

1415
01:13:01.172 --> 01:13:06.094
- No. Do you remember that
he gave me his business card?

1416
01:13:08.054 --> 01:13:12.308
- Please don't tell me you had
that man business shut down.

1417
01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:14.269
- No. let me finish.

1418
01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:16.730
- [Melisende] Okay.
- Okay.

1419
01:13:17.939 --> 01:13:21.484
Because of you taking
me to that new place.

1420
01:13:21.526 --> 01:13:23.611
I was able to find
my future husband.

1421
01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:30.201
- Yo. what? Girl. when and
where did this all happen?

1422
01:13:31.494 --> 01:13:32.495
Hold on. Wait.

1423
01:13:34.247 --> 01:13:35.457
You on crack?

1424
01:13:36.458 --> 01:13:38.209
- No. stop.

1425
01:13:39.252 --> 01:13:40.754
- No. girl. For real.

1426
01:13:40.795 --> 01:13:43.256
I know you've been
depressed and everything

1427
01:13:43.298 --> 01:13:44.716
and drinking a lot.

1428
01:13:44.758 --> 01:13:47.886
but this sound like a
crackhead move. girl.

1429
01:13:47.927 --> 01:13:49.262
For real.

1430
01:13:49.304 --> 01:13:52.223
- No. okay? Look.

1431
01:13:52.265 --> 01:13:54.601
I called you several times

1432
01:13:54.642 --> 01:13:58.021
and you didn't answer
your phone. okay?

1433
01:13:58.063 --> 01:13:59.606
I was feeling lonely.

1434
01:13:59.647 --> 01:14:02.901
I picked up my purse and
his business card fell out.

1435
01:14:02.942 --> 01:14:03.985
So I called him.

1436
01:14:05.403 --> 01:14:06.738
- I'm sorry. girl.

1437
01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:10.408
That might been my twin
night. Paul and Saul.

1438
01:14:10.450 --> 01:14:12.577
- Ugh. No meat.
- Yes.

1439
01:14:13.953 --> 01:14:16.664
- I'm actually glad
you didn't answer

1440
01:14:16.706 --> 01:14:22.170
because I called Mr. Hudson
Wheeler and he came over.

1441
01:14:22.212 --> 01:14:26.216
- Oh. so he the reason why
my best friend went MIA.

1442
01:14:27.592 --> 01:14:31.304
So he must've had you tied up
the other day when I came by

1443
01:14:31.346 --> 01:14:33.807
because you didn't
come to the door.

1444
01:14:33.848 --> 01:14:37.102
And did you change the locks?

1445
01:14:37.143 --> 01:14:40.438
- Yes. I forgot to tell
you. I changed the locks.

1446
01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:42.982
but Hudson decided that
it'll be a good idea

1447
01:14:43.024 --> 01:14:45.443
since I don't know how the
killers had a way in my home.

1448
01:14:45.485 --> 01:14:49.155
- Oh. you calling him by
first name basis. huh?

1449
01:14:49.197 --> 01:14:52.826
Mm. I see who calling the
shots around here now.

1450
01:14:52.867 --> 01:14:55.578
- No. okay. But
he is a big help.

1451
01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:57.831
And he's someone
important in my life now.

1452
01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:03.837
- Well. I'm happy for you girl.
I'm happy. sis. No. really.

1453
01:15:03.878 --> 01:15:05.630
- [Rainey] Thank you.
- I am.

1454
01:15:05.672 --> 01:15:07.632
- But the real reason
why you couldn't reach me

1455
01:15:07.674 --> 01:15:12.345
was because Hudson took me
to a private island resort.

1456
01:15:12.387 --> 01:15:13.513
and I changed my lock

1457
01:15:13.555 --> 01:15:16.182
so you could go
shopping somewhere else.

1458
01:15:18.685 --> 01:15:21.062
- So how much I get paid?

1459
01:15:22.313 --> 01:15:23.314
- Paid what?

1460
01:15:24.941 --> 01:15:28.945
- Paid. P-A-I-D.

1461
01:15:30.155 --> 01:15:33.199
Girl. I need my money.

1462
01:15:33.241 --> 01:15:34.492
- I don't-

1463
01:15:34.534 --> 01:15:36.786
Paid? How you getting paid?
What you getting paid?

1464
01:15:36.828 --> 01:15:40.331
- Calculating your and
his finance. honey.

1465
01:15:40.373 --> 01:15:42.876
I'mma need $100.000 for each.

1466
01:15:42.917 --> 01:15:44.586
You can start with a set up fee.

1467
01:15:45.754 --> 01:15:47.714
- You know what?
I got you. girl.

1468
01:15:48.757 --> 01:15:52.761
- Okay. well. it's
time to celebrate.

1469
01:15:53.928 --> 01:15:55.638
I'mma go pour me
a glass of wine.

1470
01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:57.849
- You go do that.
- Okay?

1471
01:15:58.850 --> 01:16:01.644
This empty? Stop
all that drinking.

1472
01:16:02.771 --> 01:16:06.024
(lighthearted music)

1473
01:16:07.442 --> 01:16:08.693
- Listen. baby.

1474
01:16:10.528 --> 01:16:12.238
Don't you think we should
work on taking things

1475
01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:13.114
to the next level?

1476
01:16:14.532 --> 01:16:18.453
And by next level. I mean
you becoming my wife.

1477
01:16:18.495 --> 01:16:20.121
- Are you serious. Hudson?

1478
01:16:21.623 --> 01:16:23.333
- I'm very serious.

1479
01:16:23.375 --> 01:16:24.542
I meant what I said

1480
01:16:24.584 --> 01:16:27.379
when I said you the
first person I wanna see

1481
01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:28.672
when I wake up

1482
01:16:28.713 --> 01:16:31.925
and the last person I
wanna see when I go to bed.

1483
01:16:31.966 --> 01:16:34.135
And even though Logan
can never be replaced.

1484
01:16:34.177 --> 01:16:35.637
I wanna work on a family.

1485
01:16:35.679 --> 01:16:38.056
I wanna work on rebuilding us.

1486
01:16:38.098 --> 01:16:40.975
rebuilding everything
fresh from start.

1487
01:16:43.269 --> 01:16:44.729
And I was thinking. basically.

1488
01:16:45.855 --> 01:16:47.691
let's make it happen as
soon as this weekend.

1489
01:16:47.732 --> 01:16:49.526
Be my wife.

1490
01:16:49.567 --> 01:16:53.613
- This weekend. baby?
Listen. I love you.

1491
01:16:53.655 --> 01:16:56.366
I thank God for you
every single day.

1492
01:16:56.408 --> 01:16:57.617
You came into my life

1493
01:16:57.659 --> 01:17:00.954
when I was in the darkest
place possible. okay?

1494
01:17:00.995 --> 01:17:03.623
But baby. I want a big wedding.

1495
01:17:03.665 --> 01:17:06.084
I want my friends and
family to be there.

1496
01:17:06.126 --> 01:17:11.089
I want my only living
relative. my aunt. to be there.

1497
01:17:11.131 --> 01:17:14.467
And baby. I can't forget
my day one. Melisende.

1498
01:17:14.509 --> 01:17:16.469
She has to be my maid of honor.

1499
01:17:16.511 --> 01:17:18.722
- All right. All
right. I understand.

1500
01:17:18.763 --> 01:17:21.558
All that's very possible.
It's still possible.

1501
01:17:21.599 --> 01:17:24.352
Everything you mentioned
to me is possible.

1502
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:28.648
But one thing I do
know is in life itself.

1503
01:17:28.690 --> 01:17:30.025
and God taught me this.

1504
01:17:31.234 --> 01:17:33.778
don't put off for tomorrow
what you can do today.

1505
01:17:34.863 --> 01:17:37.824
Nothing's promised.
And you know this.

1506
01:17:39.034 --> 01:17:41.786
So let's live like it. I wanna
make the promises to you.

1507
01:17:43.288 --> 01:17:46.416
I want you to understand
that your heart is mine

1508
01:17:46.458 --> 01:17:47.751
and my heart is yours.

1509
01:17:48.877 --> 01:17:51.338
And if your friends coming
is that important to you.

1510
01:17:51.379 --> 01:17:53.548
we can fly them out to Vegas.

1511
01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:56.384
It's time to get (music
drowns out speaker).

1512
01:17:56.426 --> 01:17:57.552
- Okay.
- [Hudson] Yeah.

1513
01:17:57.594 --> 01:18:00.180
- Let's do it.
- [Hudson] I like that smile.

1514
01:18:00.221 --> 01:18:03.391
- I'm ready to become
Rainey Wheeler Storms.

1515
01:18:04.642 --> 01:18:07.562
Baby. can you take my last name.

1516
01:18:07.604 --> 01:18:09.773
you know. 'cause of
my daddy's law firm?

1517
01:18:09.814 --> 01:18:14.527
And no offense. baby. but
Wheeler is a weak name.

1518
01:18:14.569 --> 01:18:18.448
- Right. Well. no offense taken.

1519
01:18:19.699 --> 01:18:23.745
Actually. Wheeler is
my sperm donor name.

1520
01:18:25.038 --> 01:18:28.750
My so-called dad lived right
behind me my whole life.

1521
01:18:28.792 --> 01:18:30.627
raising a family.

1522
01:18:30.669 --> 01:18:34.714
and never even said. not
even two words to me.

1523
01:18:34.756 --> 01:18:36.925
So you on to something there.

1524
01:18:36.966 --> 01:18:40.387
- Baby. I'm so sorry
you had to endure that.

1525
01:18:40.428 --> 01:18:41.596
(knocking on door)

1526
01:18:41.638 --> 01:18:44.974
Wait. Who could
that be this late?

1527
01:18:46.059 --> 01:18:47.644
That better not be
that crazy Melisende.

1528
01:18:47.686 --> 01:18:49.854
You know what. baby?
Don't worry about it.

1529
01:18:49.896 --> 01:18:55.527
Lemme just get rid of her.
and this is our special night.

1530
01:18:55.568 --> 01:18:56.569
Okay? So just lemme-

1531
01:18:56.611 --> 01:18:58.279
- Wait. You know what?
- Hmm?

1532
01:18:58.321 --> 01:18:59.531
- Stay put.

1533
01:18:59.572 --> 01:19:00.740
- All right.

1534
01:19:00.782 --> 01:19:02.492
- I don't want you
taking another step

1535
01:19:04.619 --> 01:19:05.870
until we make it official.

1536
01:19:07.330 --> 01:19:10.542
When you step out. (music
drowns out speaker) you're mine.

1537
01:19:10.583 --> 01:19:15.505
* You and me. you
and me. my baby

1538
01:19:15.547 --> 01:19:16.840
- Baby. it's beautiful.

1539
01:19:16.881 --> 01:19:20.677
- Oh. I know. Do you love
it or do you love it?

1540
01:19:20.719 --> 01:19:23.805
- I love it. baby. Thank you.
- Okay.

1541
01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:28.143
- Okay. lemme just. lemme get
rid of her. Okay? Lemme just-

1542
01:19:28.184 --> 01:19:30.020
- You. you know what?
- What?

1543
01:19:30.061 --> 01:19:31.896
- I'll handle this. I
have some errands to run.

1544
01:19:31.938 --> 01:19:33.690
- [Rainey] Okay.
- So I gotta step out.

1545
01:19:33.732 --> 01:19:34.858
- [Rainey] All right.

1546
01:19:34.899 --> 01:19:36.693
- Make sure you stay put.
- [Rainey] Okay.

1547
01:19:36.735 --> 01:19:37.736
- And relax.
- [Rainey] All right.

1548
01:19:37.777 --> 01:19:38.778
- This is our
special night. okay?

1549
01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:40.238
- [Rainey] Yes.

1550
01:19:49.998 --> 01:19:52.625
- [Philomena] Oh. hello there.

1551
01:19:52.667 --> 01:19:55.670
I see why Rainey didn't
come to the door.

1552
01:19:55.712 --> 01:19:58.089
And may I ask. who are you?

1553
01:19:59.507 --> 01:20:01.926
I haven't seen Rainey
with another man
since Logan's father.

1554
01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:04.929
Hmm?

1555
01:20:07.807 --> 01:20:10.810
- What do you want. Philomena?

1556
01:20:10.852 --> 01:20:13.938
I don't recall my phone
ringing for you to stop by.

1557
01:20:15.190 --> 01:20:19.861
- I came to have a woman to
woman chat with you. Okay?

1558
01:20:19.903 --> 01:20:21.404
I knew if I would've called you.

1559
01:20:21.446 --> 01:20:22.947
you wouldn't have answered
or said I can come by.

1560
01:20:22.989 --> 01:20:24.657
So here I am.

1561
01:20:24.699 --> 01:20:27.202
(rain pelting)

1562
01:20:28.495 --> 01:20:32.665
- I'm gonna let you
have your girl talk.

1563
01:20:32.707 --> 01:20:34.000
I'mma excuse myself.

1564
01:20:34.042 --> 01:20:35.335
I'll get back to you later on

1565
01:20:35.377 --> 01:20:38.838
so we can continue
our special night.

1566
01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:40.298
- [Rainey] Okay.

1567
01:20:40.340 --> 01:20:43.385
(rain pelting)

1568
01:20:43.426 --> 01:20:45.053
- [Hudson] Excuse me.

1569
01:20:46.262 --> 01:20:50.850
- By the way. do you
happen to have a brother.

1570
01:20:50.892 --> 01:20:53.228
uncle. cousin. or daddy?

1571
01:20:53.269 --> 01:20:56.940
- I absolutely do not.
I'm one of a kind.

1572
01:20:59.609 --> 01:21:01.027
- Girl. Girl. girl.

1573
01:21:01.069 --> 01:21:05.031
Where did you find that man
of yours with those big feet?

1574
01:21:05.073 --> 01:21:07.534
Oh. and did I hear him
say soon to be wife?

1575
01:21:08.535 --> 01:21:12.372
What have I missed out
on these last few years?

1576
01:21:12.414 --> 01:21:13.456
You kept him hidden.

1577
01:21:14.833 --> 01:21:18.420
- Like I said. what
are you doing here?

1578
01:21:18.461 --> 01:21:21.965
I only gave you an address so
that you can receive flowers

1579
01:21:22.007 --> 01:21:23.675
from friends and families

1580
01:21:23.717 --> 01:21:27.387
to pay respects
since you did not.

1581
01:21:27.429 --> 01:21:30.890
- Look. Rainey. all I ask is
for five minutes of your time

1582
01:21:30.932 --> 01:21:32.392
to hear me out.

1583
01:21:32.434 --> 01:21:37.731
Okay? Please. I loved
your brother just as much.

1584
01:21:37.772 --> 01:21:40.859
And besides. when all this
happened. I was out the country.

1585
01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:42.902
I heard about it on my way back.

1586
01:21:42.944 --> 01:21:44.946
You know I woulda
been there for you.

1587
01:21:47.449 --> 01:21:50.326
- You have five minutes
and then you're out.

1588
01:21:52.912 --> 01:21:55.206
- Mm. My feet are killing
me. Can we sit down?

1589
01:21:55.248 --> 01:21:56.916
I ordered these new shoes online

1590
01:21:56.958 --> 01:21:59.044
and they're two sizes
too small. so...

1591
01:21:59.085 --> 01:22:03.048
- Yeah. that's what cheap
shoes would do to you. honey.

1592
01:22:04.299 --> 01:22:05.967
I don't want you to think that
it's that kinda connection.

1593
01:22:06.009 --> 01:22:08.636
so we're good right here.

1594
01:22:08.678 --> 01:22:10.055
- Okay.

1595
01:22:10.096 --> 01:22:11.514
I been calling
down to the station

1596
01:22:11.556 --> 01:22:12.766
to get updates on the case.

1597
01:22:12.807 --> 01:22:15.935
and the records are sealed
due to family request.

1598
01:22:15.977 --> 01:22:19.439
- [Rainey] Because it's
no one else's business.

1599
01:22:19.481 --> 01:22:20.690
- We're family. Rainey.

1600
01:22:21.816 --> 01:22:23.777
You know I love you
just like a sister.

1601
01:22:23.818 --> 01:22:26.112
in spite of our past.

1602
01:22:26.154 --> 01:22:28.573
- We are not family.

1603
01:22:28.615 --> 01:22:32.160
My brother divorced you long
before he left this earth.

1604
01:22:33.411 --> 01:22:38.166
So stop running around here
like you're Mrs. Evans Storms.

1605
01:22:38.208 --> 01:22:40.251
My father only let
you keep that name

1606
01:22:40.293 --> 01:22:42.837
to keep the divorce quiet.

1607
01:22:42.879 --> 01:22:45.173
And he paid you very well.

1608
01:22:45.215 --> 01:22:47.133
- What you're
forgetting. Rainey.

1609
01:22:47.175 --> 01:22:49.803
is that me and Evan
remained the same.

1610
01:22:49.844 --> 01:22:51.971
We were best of friends.

1611
01:22:52.013 --> 01:22:54.516
Hell. half the men he
dated. I introduced him to.

1612
01:22:56.935 --> 01:22:58.937
- And is probably
one of the ones

1613
01:22:58.978 --> 01:23:01.940
that took the life of
my brother and son.

1614
01:23:01.981 --> 01:23:05.777
You know what? Get out.
Okay? And never come back.

1615
01:23:05.819 --> 01:23:07.779
- Never? Wow.

1616
01:23:08.947 --> 01:23:11.533
I'm truly sorry you feel
that way. I really am.

1617
01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:18.957
You know. I'm still
gonna pray for you. Okay?

1618
01:23:18.998 --> 01:23:20.500
Oh. and by the way.

1619
01:23:20.542 --> 01:23:23.503
I came back to let you know
that your little friend.

1620
01:23:23.545 --> 01:23:28.049
the one that you call
sister. she can't be trusted.

1621
01:23:28.091 --> 01:23:30.969
Word on the street in our old
neighborhood. is that she.

1622
01:23:31.011 --> 01:23:32.178
she can't be trusted

1623
01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:34.764
and that she's really
not your friend. Rainey.

1624
01:23:34.806 --> 01:23:35.432
Just be careful.

1625
01:23:36.933 --> 01:23:42.856
- Same old Philomena bringing
back bones from hood rat dogs.

1626
01:23:42.897 --> 01:23:44.232
You have always been jealous

1627
01:23:44.274 --> 01:23:48.111
of me and Melisende's
sisterhood relationship

1628
01:23:48.153 --> 01:23:50.071
because you don't have one.

1629
01:23:53.033 --> 01:23:54.701
- You know what? You're
right. You're right.

1630
01:23:54.743 --> 01:23:56.870
I better leave before
we both say something

1631
01:23:56.911 --> 01:23:57.829
that we'll regret.

1632
01:24:00.749 --> 01:24:04.377
But just to clear the air
here. Me? Jealous of her?

1633
01:24:05.587 --> 01:24:07.380
That's a joke.
That's a good one.

1634
01:24:07.422 --> 01:24:10.550
Everyone knows she lives
off of you. mama. Hmm?

1635
01:24:10.592 --> 01:24:13.720
- Bye. Philomena. Your
five minutes is up.

1636
01:24:13.762 --> 01:24:18.058
- Okay. All right. Take
care of yourself. Rainey.

1637
01:24:18.099 --> 01:24:20.977
And congratulations on
your new love and marriage

1638
01:24:21.019 --> 01:24:24.773
and I'm really
happy for you. okay?

1639
01:24:24.814 --> 01:24:25.565
You deserve it.

1640
01:24:27.233 --> 01:24:30.945
Please keep me posted on
any updates on the case.

1641
01:24:30.987 --> 01:24:32.280
I'll see my way out.

1642
01:24:35.950 --> 01:24:38.370
By the way. remember
what I told you?

1643
01:24:38.411 --> 01:24:41.039
Be careful with your
little friend. Melisende.

1644
01:24:41.081 --> 01:24:42.415
or whatever her name is.

1645
01:24:43.416 --> 01:24:44.084
Take care.

1646
01:24:44.125 --> 01:24:46.127
- Yeah. Uh-huh. Bye.

1647
01:24:49.673 --> 01:24:53.093
The nerve. I'll tell her
when hell freezes over.

1648
01:24:53.134 --> 01:24:55.220
She will not ruin
my special night.

1649
01:24:56.971 --> 01:24:59.808
(phone ringing)

1650
01:25:00.767 --> 01:25:05.605
- Hello? Aw. yeah.
The plan is in motion.

1651
01:25:06.815 --> 01:25:09.275
She said yes. We're gonna
be leaving next week.

1652
01:25:10.485 --> 01:25:13.238
And the best thing about
it is she has no clue

1653
01:25:13.279 --> 01:25:14.781
who I really am.

1654
01:25:14.823 --> 01:25:18.118
or what's about to happen
to her whole entire world.

1655
01:25:18.159 --> 01:25:20.328
And she thinks she
lost her family before.

1656
01:25:21.788 --> 01:25:24.249
I been drugging the
wine that I bring her.

1657
01:25:26.042 --> 01:25:27.419
So that always works easy.

1658
01:25:29.045 --> 01:25:30.755
Yeah. and after we get married.

1659
01:25:31.798 --> 01:25:34.050
I'm gonna increase the dosage.

1660
01:25:34.092 --> 01:25:35.135
That way her friends and family

1661
01:25:35.176 --> 01:25:37.554
could start seeing
her mental state.

1662
01:25:38.972 --> 01:25:40.306
And after that.

1663
01:25:40.348 --> 01:25:42.684
I'll get the doctors to
diagnose her incompetent.

1664
01:25:44.310 --> 01:25:46.271
Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh.

1665
01:25:48.648 --> 01:25:53.653
So then. it's easier for
me to take over her company

1666
01:25:53.695 --> 01:25:54.946
and all her assets.

1667
01:25:54.988 --> 01:25:59.034
Pretty much everything she
owns be all in my hands.

1668
01:25:59.075 --> 01:26:00.118
So this is what
I need you to do.

1669
01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:01.578
I need you to get that ticket.

1670
01:26:01.619 --> 01:26:06.249
'Cause I need to get
back home. all right? Ah.

1671
01:26:07.375 --> 01:26:11.421
Yeah. Way too easy. man.

1672
01:26:12.964 --> 01:26:13.923
Way too easy.

1673
01:26:15.759 --> 01:26:20.555
- Yes. girl. I am officially
Mrs. Hudson Wheeler Storms.

1674
01:26:20.597 --> 01:26:22.390
I'm so happy.
- [Melisende] Yes.

1675
01:26:23.558 --> 01:26:26.311
Even though it was
not what we planned.

1676
01:26:26.353 --> 01:26:30.023
the big Diana princess
wedding. I got to say.

1677
01:26:30.065 --> 01:26:31.524
it was romantic. girl.

1678
01:26:31.566 --> 01:26:34.986
for Hudson to fly me and
your auntie to Paris.

1679
01:26:36.321 --> 01:26:40.492
put us in the most expensive.
romantic place ever.

1680
01:26:40.533 --> 01:26:43.453
And the men. good Lord. girl.

1681
01:26:45.121 --> 01:26:47.499
I never been out
the county. right.

1682
01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:50.210
Just to think of the type
of French men I could've met

1683
01:26:50.251 --> 01:26:53.129
through I had another
week there. honey.

1684
01:26:53.171 --> 01:26:54.839
(Melisende laughs)
Woo.

1685
01:26:54.881 --> 01:26:57.717
- Yeah. exactly. That's
what I was afraid of.

1686
01:26:57.759 --> 01:27:02.055
My friend slash sister
missing in action.

1687
01:27:02.097 --> 01:27:03.682
doing what most single women do

1688
01:27:03.723 --> 01:27:06.226
when they run off
with strange men.

1689
01:27:06.267 --> 01:27:07.852
(Melisende chuckles)

1690
01:27:07.894 --> 01:27:10.063
- [Melisende] Honey.
trust and believe

1691
01:27:10.105 --> 01:27:11.731
that would have been flipped.

1692
01:27:11.773 --> 01:27:15.235
They woulda been
missing in action. Okay?

1693
01:27:15.276 --> 01:27:19.072
Plus. after they had
a dip of delicious.

1694
01:27:19.114 --> 01:27:22.200
they woulda thought twice.

1695
01:27:22.242 --> 01:27:26.121
But for real. girl. I
am so happy for you.

1696
01:27:26.162 --> 01:27:29.416
When are you going to
gimme another godchild?

1697
01:27:29.457 --> 01:27:32.752
Even though no one
can place my Logan.

1698
01:27:32.794 --> 01:27:36.297
but a girl would be nice
so I can dress her up.

1699
01:27:39.300 --> 01:27:44.347
Hello? Rainey. Are you okay?

1700
01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:46.433
Hello?
- Oh.

1701
01:27:47.851 --> 01:27:49.769
Yeah. I'm. I'm here.

1702
01:27:49.811 --> 01:27:54.274
Just. just been dizzy
and can't focus.

1703
01:27:54.315 --> 01:27:57.152
That's why I haven't been
in the office for a while.

1704
01:27:57.193 --> 01:27:58.737
I been feeling funny.

1705
01:28:00.196 --> 01:28:02.198
- [Melisende] Maybe
you're pregnant.

1706
01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:05.702
You guys was in lover country.

1707
01:28:05.744 --> 01:28:09.205
- No. I took five
pregnancy tests

1708
01:28:09.247 --> 01:28:11.374
and they all came back negative.

1709
01:28:12.792 --> 01:28:17.464
I don't know. I'm probably gonna
go and see a doctor though.

1710
01:28:17.505 --> 01:28:18.965
- [Melisende] So tell me.

1711
01:28:19.007 --> 01:28:22.302
you had me in suspense
girl for a whole month

1712
01:28:22.344 --> 01:28:26.181
about why Philomena came
to see you that night.

1713
01:28:26.222 --> 01:28:27.390
We never covered it.

1714
01:28:27.432 --> 01:28:30.810
And when Trudy term is
up at that law firm?

1715
01:28:30.852 --> 01:28:32.228
I know it's soon.

1716
01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:36.274
- Girl. yes. Her term
is up in five years.

1717
01:28:36.316 --> 01:28:38.234
So that's what the will said.

1718
01:28:38.276 --> 01:28:42.947
It's been four years.
seven months. two weeks.

1719
01:28:44.199 --> 01:28:45.450
11 minutes and 28 seconds.

1720
01:28:47.410 --> 01:28:50.997
- [Melisende] Oh. I
know you tired of her.

1721
01:28:52.290 --> 01:28:55.335
You know. I'm free from
employment. so if you need me.

1722
01:28:55.377 --> 01:28:58.004
I am ready to work. okay?

1723
01:28:58.046 --> 01:29:02.550
So back to what I asked
earlier in the conversation.

1724
01:29:02.592 --> 01:29:04.135
what did Philomena want?

1725
01:29:05.553 --> 01:29:10.642
- Dang. you nosy girl. Nothing.
Just the same old Philomena.

1726
01:29:13.937 --> 01:29:16.481
Look. lemme call you back.

1727
01:29:17.691 --> 01:29:19.609
I need to put a
lock on this door

1728
01:29:19.651 --> 01:29:23.863
because unwanted people
just keep walking in.

1729
01:29:27.033 --> 01:29:30.912
- [Melisende] I hear you.
girl. Don't be too hard. okay?

1730
01:29:30.954 --> 01:29:36.084
You are married now. so
see you later. honey.

1731
01:29:40.338 --> 01:29:43.091
- Well. sorry to bother you.

1732
01:29:44.342 --> 01:29:46.011
but actually I was
just bringing you

1733
01:29:46.052 --> 01:29:48.263
Miss Connie Lee's paperwork
that you requested.

1734
01:29:48.304 --> 01:29:53.059
- Just put it on my
desk please. Thank you.

1735
01:29:53.101 --> 01:29:54.394
- Sure.

1736
01:29:54.436 --> 01:29:56.104
- [Rainey] Is there
anything else you need?

1737
01:29:56.146 --> 01:29:58.690
- Yeah. Are you feeling okay?

1738
01:29:59.899 --> 01:30:03.570
Do you need anything? Some
water. some crackers. anything?

1739
01:30:03.611 --> 01:30:05.405
You don't look too good.

1740
01:30:05.447 --> 01:30:09.200
- No. I'm fine. Um. just...

1741
01:30:10.410 --> 01:30:12.704
You know what? I
might leave early.

1742
01:30:12.746 --> 01:30:16.541
So reschedule all of my
appointments after lunch.

1743
01:30:16.583 --> 01:30:21.338
And honestly. it's just
probably from the plane.

1744
01:30:21.379 --> 01:30:24.924
- Mm. well. actually.
first and foremost.

1745
01:30:24.966 --> 01:30:27.719
congratulations on
your new marriage.

1746
01:30:27.761 --> 01:30:30.263
And that feeling you're
feeling right now

1747
01:30:30.305 --> 01:30:33.141
is probably jet lag.

1748
01:30:33.183 --> 01:30:36.936
You know. it does cause fatigue.
stomach ache. headaches.

1749
01:30:36.978 --> 01:30:39.272
et cetera. et cetera.

1750
01:30:39.314 --> 01:30:40.899
Maybe you should seek a doctor.

1751
01:30:42.067 --> 01:30:42.817
- Wow.

1752
01:30:43.985 --> 01:30:46.196
I. I didn't think
that you knew anything

1753
01:30:46.237 --> 01:30:47.864
about riding planes.

1754
01:30:47.906 --> 01:30:49.949
Only a bus.

1755
01:30:49.991 --> 01:30:51.576
- Well. that's
the problem. love.

1756
01:30:51.618 --> 01:30:53.995
There's a lot of things
you don't know about me.

1757
01:30:55.622 --> 01:31:00.585
Listen. Rainey. I know you
didn't really care for me.

1758
01:31:00.627 --> 01:31:03.296
and you probably even
hated me a little bit

1759
01:31:03.338 --> 01:31:05.382
for messing with your father.

1760
01:31:05.423 --> 01:31:07.092
but it's not what you think.

1761
01:31:08.635 --> 01:31:10.136
- [Rainey] Oh. yeah.

1762
01:31:10.178 --> 01:31:12.931
- I respected and loved your
mother way too much for that.

1763
01:31:12.972 --> 01:31:13.682
- Listen. Trudy.

1764
01:31:14.849 --> 01:31:17.435
I know how much my
father felt about you

1765
01:31:17.477 --> 01:31:19.604
and how much he cared about you.

1766
01:31:19.646 --> 01:31:23.316
That's why you're still
here. because of him.

1767
01:31:23.358 --> 01:31:24.567
But I don't hate you.

1768
01:31:25.568 --> 01:31:28.697
My brother was madly
in love with you.

1769
01:31:28.738 --> 01:31:31.032
And after he caught you
in bed with our father.

1770
01:31:31.074 --> 01:31:34.703
well. he never trusted
or dated a woman again.

1771
01:31:36.705 --> 01:31:39.374
- See. it's not what you think.

1772
01:31:39.416 --> 01:31:41.626
You never gave us a
chance to explain.

1773
01:31:42.544 --> 01:31:45.130
You see. I was covering
for your brother.

1774
01:31:46.297 --> 01:31:51.511
You know. Evan wanted to look
good in your father's eyes.

1775
01:31:51.553 --> 01:31:53.763
so he wanted to be with a woman.

1776
01:31:53.805 --> 01:31:58.476
And at the time. I was
broke. I needed some money.

1777
01:31:58.518 --> 01:32:00.061
my bills need to be paid.

1778
01:32:00.103 --> 01:32:03.440
So he offered to
fund me a little bit

1779
01:32:03.481 --> 01:32:04.899
long as I been his woman.

1780
01:32:06.443 --> 01:32:08.486
only for the protection
of your father.

1781
01:32:08.528 --> 01:32:12.657
But the only thing was
I couldn't marry Evan.

1782
01:32:12.699 --> 01:32:14.784
And that's why he
married Philomena.

1783
01:32:16.286 --> 01:32:20.915
- Why are you lying? Evan
would never do that. Okay?

1784
01:32:23.626 --> 01:32:26.004
Just. just get out. All right.

1785
01:32:28.131 --> 01:32:30.050
- You know what? Here.

1786
01:32:32.469 --> 01:32:33.803
Just do me a favor.

1787
01:32:35.930 --> 01:32:40.643
Read this. and then
maybe. possibly.
you'll learn the truth.

1788
01:32:41.936 --> 01:32:46.232
You know what? I am truly
sorry. Rainey. I really am.

1789
01:32:47.567 --> 01:32:51.446
Your father asked me to
look over this company

1790
01:32:51.488 --> 01:32:53.114
as well as look over you.

1791
01:32:54.157 --> 01:32:56.618
And I done just that.

1792
01:32:57.535 --> 01:33:00.288
You see. I'm a real friend.

1793
01:33:01.539 --> 01:33:02.749
A true friend.

1794
01:33:04.501 --> 01:33:08.463
Now. what you need
to be concerned about

1795
01:33:08.505 --> 01:33:11.132
is that friend Melisende.

1796
01:33:13.176 --> 01:33:16.221
Your brother's seen
it. I've seen it.

1797
01:33:17.597 --> 01:33:21.685
Your mother's seen it. way
back since we were little kids.

1798
01:33:23.395 --> 01:33:26.648
- Now you just
talking crazy. Okay?

1799
01:33:27.816 --> 01:33:32.445
You and Philomena
sound just alike.

1800
01:33:32.487 --> 01:33:34.489
You two always
been jealous of her

1801
01:33:34.531 --> 01:33:35.615
because she's beautiful

1802
01:33:35.657 --> 01:33:38.243
and she gets everything
that she wants.

1803
01:33:38.284 --> 01:33:40.453
Please leave now.

1804
01:33:40.495 --> 01:33:43.915
- Your father was
going through something

1805
01:33:43.957 --> 01:33:45.750
and was about to lose it all.

1806
01:33:47.002 --> 01:33:49.421
It was me that stayed in
this office day and night.

1807
01:33:49.462 --> 01:33:50.630
night and day.

1808
01:33:50.672 --> 01:33:54.676
teaching myself how to
keep this business open.

1809
01:33:54.718 --> 01:33:56.845
And that's exactly
what I've done.

1810
01:33:56.886 --> 01:33:59.389
But you know what. baby girl?

1811
01:33:59.431 --> 01:34:01.891
Whether you accept me or not.

1812
01:34:01.933 --> 01:34:05.895
I am the reason why Storms
Law Firm still exists

1813
01:34:05.937 --> 01:34:07.355
and is still standing.

1814
01:34:07.397 --> 01:34:08.690
But you know what. Rainey?

1815
01:34:10.191 --> 01:34:13.862
I'm gonna pray for you 'cause
you're gonna need me one day.

1816
01:34:15.864 --> 01:34:18.742
- Need you? Girl. bye.

1817
01:34:20.035 --> 01:34:24.706
I am a well known attorney.
I have a successful career.

1818
01:34:25.915 --> 01:34:31.629
I have a fine. rich. well-to-do
husband. money in the bank.

1819
01:34:31.671 --> 01:34:37.052
a beautiful home. nice
cars and businesses.

1820
01:34:37.093 --> 01:34:40.096
so what could I
possibly need from you?

1821
01:34:42.474 --> 01:34:44.351
- Wow. You know what?

1822
01:34:45.727 --> 01:34:48.772
Listen to all of those
wonderful things you have.

1823
01:34:50.357 --> 01:34:54.986
All of the fame. the
fortune. all the material.

1824
01:34:56.613 --> 01:34:58.531
But you know what's funny?

1825
01:34:58.573 --> 01:35:02.410
Not once that I hear you mention
the most important thing.

1826
01:35:04.704 --> 01:35:05.955
And that was God.

1827
01:35:08.541 --> 01:35:09.501
So you know what?

1828
01:35:11.628 --> 01:35:13.880
All the other stuff you
just mentioned to me.

1829
01:35:16.716 --> 01:35:18.927
that doesn't phase me.

1830
01:35:18.968 --> 01:35:22.430
But I tell you what.
I wish you well.

1831
01:35:26.559 --> 01:35:30.980
(somber music)
* Oh. oh

1832
01:35:31.022 --> 01:35:33.525
- This is Evan's handwriting.

1833
01:35:36.945 --> 01:35:40.281
Lemme go. I need to
read this letter later.

1834
01:35:41.533 --> 01:35:45.537
Why would she give me a letter
from Evan addressed to me?

1835
01:35:47.956 --> 01:35:49.207
Something's not right.

1836
01:35:52.794 --> 01:35:54.838
I need to call a doctor.

1837
01:35:56.756 --> 01:36:01.928
* Know that you're
not here with me

1838
01:36:02.971 --> 01:36:07.142
* See only you
with no disguise

1839
01:36:09.519 --> 01:36:14.399
* Reminisce the fond memories

1840
01:36:14.441 --> 01:36:17.444
* Memories

1841
01:36:17.485 --> 01:36:20.405
(cellphone ringing)

1842
01:36:24.868 --> 01:36:26.828
- Hello.
- [Melisende] Hey. girl.

1843
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:30.832
I just got your messages.
Is everything okay?

1844
01:36:30.874 --> 01:36:35.337
- No. Why haven't you
been answering my calls?

1845
01:36:35.378 --> 01:36:36.713
I been calling for days now.

1846
01:36:36.755 --> 01:36:38.340
- [Melisende] I'm sorry. girl.

1847
01:36:38.381 --> 01:36:41.051
You know how I get
when I meet a new man.

1848
01:36:41.092 --> 01:36:43.720
I get MIA on a sister.

1849
01:36:43.762 --> 01:36:46.890
So what is this about
a letter from Evan

1850
01:36:46.931 --> 01:36:48.308
you left on my voicemail?

1851
01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:49.309
- I don't remember.

1852
01:36:50.393 --> 01:36:51.811
And I need to get
in to see a doctor

1853
01:36:51.853 --> 01:36:55.357
because I haven't been able to
go into the office for days.

1854
01:36:55.398 --> 01:36:59.319
- [Melisende] What you mean?
So what's been going on?

1855
01:36:59.361 --> 01:37:00.779
- I'm forgetting things

1856
01:37:00.820 --> 01:37:03.073
and I'm seeing things
that aren't there

1857
01:37:04.115 --> 01:37:06.159
and I just have these
really bad headaches.

1858
01:37:06.201 --> 01:37:07.660
- [Melisende]
Please don't tell me

1859
01:37:07.702 --> 01:37:09.287
you are drinking heavy again.

1860
01:37:09.329 --> 01:37:13.708
- No. Hudson and I only have
one glass of wine at dinner.

1861
01:37:13.750 --> 01:37:14.751
So...

1862
01:37:14.793 --> 01:37:16.252
- [Melisende] Where
is Hudson now?

1863
01:37:16.294 --> 01:37:18.755
- Hudson went to go and get
me something for my headache

1864
01:37:18.797 --> 01:37:21.257
and he also made me an
appointment for Friday.

1865
01:37:21.299 --> 01:37:24.636
- [Melisende] Okay.
That's in two days.

1866
01:37:24.678 --> 01:37:26.680
So do you need me
to come over now?

1867
01:37:26.721 --> 01:37:27.847
- I'm just gonna go to sleep.

1868
01:37:27.889 --> 01:37:29.933
- [Melisende] Okay

1869
01:37:29.974 --> 01:37:31.476
- He'll be back in a few.

1870
01:37:31.518 --> 01:37:34.729
- [Melisende] Call me
if you need me. okay?

1871
01:37:34.771 --> 01:37:36.189
- Okay.

1872
01:37:36.231 --> 01:37:37.982
- [Melisende] And tell Hudson
to call so I know you okay.

1873
01:37:38.024 --> 01:37:43.113
- All right. I will.
(tense music)

1874
01:37:58.753 --> 01:38:01.381
(wine swishing)

1875
01:38:05.844 --> 01:38:09.347
(tense music continues)

1876
01:38:38.293 --> 01:38:39.836
- [Evan] I know you
would never forgive me

1877
01:38:39.878 --> 01:38:41.171
for putting you in this position

1878
01:38:41.212 --> 01:38:44.591
of pretending to be my
fiance for seven years.

1879
01:38:45.633 --> 01:38:48.261
I know my family been
upset with you for years.

1880
01:38:48.303 --> 01:38:50.597
thinking you were the
cause of me being gay

1881
01:38:50.638 --> 01:38:52.057
and breaking up our family.

1882
01:38:53.141 --> 01:38:56.770
But you got to understand
how my father really was.

1883
01:38:56.811 --> 01:38:59.439
I could have never
faced him and told him.

1884
01:38:59.481 --> 01:39:02.776
or. or even come out to
let him or the world know

1885
01:39:02.817 --> 01:39:05.528
at that time his only son.

1886
01:39:05.570 --> 01:39:08.698
I knew my dad had eyes
for you for years.

1887
01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:11.659
So I punished him for treating
me the way that he did.

1888
01:39:11.701 --> 01:39:14.204
For years when he came home
from dropping Rainey off

1889
01:39:14.245 --> 01:39:16.373
to law school in Washington DC.

1890
01:39:16.414 --> 01:39:19.042
the truth revealed
when he caught me

1891
01:39:19.084 --> 01:39:21.002
and Carl Stetson
in bed together.

1892
01:39:21.044 --> 01:39:23.588
So I lied and told my
sister and everyone

1893
01:39:23.630 --> 01:39:25.840
I caught him and you in the bed.

1894
01:39:25.882 --> 01:39:26.883
Keep being there for Rainey.

1895
01:39:26.925 --> 01:39:28.968
no matter how much
she rejects you.

1896
01:39:29.010 --> 01:39:30.637
I know it's hard.

1897
01:39:30.679 --> 01:39:33.932
but if she only knew your
sacrifices for this family.

1898
01:39:33.973 --> 01:39:36.017
Watch that Melisende Carter.

1899
01:39:36.059 --> 01:39:39.854
She wants my sister's life.
but has Rainey fooled.

1900
01:39:39.896 --> 01:39:42.899
Forgive me. Evan.

1901
01:39:42.941 --> 01:39:44.067
- Rainey.

1902
01:39:45.944 --> 01:39:47.153
Rainey.

1903
01:39:48.113 --> 01:39:49.948
No. I did not give her too much.

1904
01:39:49.989 --> 01:39:51.783
But this is not
the effect we need.

1905
01:39:53.118 --> 01:39:54.661
No. not at all.

1906
01:39:54.703 --> 01:39:57.831
But I need you to get here
now. She's not breathing.

1907
01:39:57.872 --> 01:40:00.083
I honestly think she's dead.

1908
01:40:01.418 --> 01:40:02.210
Okay.

1909
01:40:07.298 --> 01:40:09.884
- I can't believe
he that stupid.

1910
01:40:09.926 --> 01:40:12.137
Lemme hurry up before
he mess up the plan.

1911
01:40:16.641 --> 01:40:17.600
Any response yet?

1912
01:40:18.601 --> 01:40:19.769
- No response at all.

1913
01:40:21.146 --> 01:40:24.024
Like I said before.
I believe she's dead.

1914
01:40:24.065 --> 01:40:25.817
and it's just not
gonna make sense.

1915
01:40:25.859 --> 01:40:31.865
me having a deceased newlywed
wife when we just got married.

1916
01:40:31.906 --> 01:40:33.158
They're gonna find those
drugs in her system.

1917
01:40:33.199 --> 01:40:35.618
- Well. you need
to get rid of them.

1918
01:40:35.660 --> 01:40:37.787
just like you did
her brother and son.

1919
01:40:39.039 --> 01:40:42.042
This need to look
like a random hit.

1920
01:40:42.083 --> 01:40:44.336
Grab her purse and keys.

1921
01:40:44.377 --> 01:40:46.880
I'mma drive her car like
she was working late

1922
01:40:46.921 --> 01:40:47.714
at the law firm.

1923
01:40:48.923 --> 01:40:51.843
- That sounds good. but
what about the money?

1924
01:40:51.885 --> 01:40:53.470
What about the business?

1925
01:40:53.511 --> 01:40:57.223
How's any of that gonna
to add up if she's dead?

1926
01:40:57.265 --> 01:40:58.850
Let's stick to the plan.

1927
01:40:58.892 --> 01:41:01.394
And the plan was
I get the money.

1928
01:41:01.436 --> 01:41:04.230
I get the business
and I get the assets.

1929
01:41:04.272 --> 01:41:06.941
You're the overseer
of all her paperwork.

1930
01:41:06.983 --> 01:41:08.860
You get all of that
money from that.

1931
01:41:08.902 --> 01:41:12.947
Soon as that's all done. we
cash out and we outta here.

1932
01:41:12.989 --> 01:41:14.949
We live happily up after.

1933
01:41:14.991 --> 01:41:18.286
- No. you messed that up.

1934
01:41:18.328 --> 01:41:20.121
So we gon' need a plan B.

1935
01:41:21.122 --> 01:41:25.585
Plus. I never really
cared for her anyway.

1936
01:41:25.627 --> 01:41:30.799
I'm glad she gone. just
like her soft brother.

1937
01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:32.467
Where's the documents you need?

1938
01:41:32.509 --> 01:41:34.552
If anything was to
ever happen to her.

1939
01:41:35.512 --> 01:41:37.764
I know how to sign
her signature.

1940
01:41:37.806 --> 01:41:39.432
I did that all the time.

1941
01:41:39.474 --> 01:41:42.602
- Okay. look. everything
is upstairs in the lockbox.

1942
01:41:42.644 --> 01:41:45.271
I gave her some of those
same drugs I put in her wine

1943
01:41:45.313 --> 01:41:48.108
just so she couldn't really
recognize what she was doing.

1944
01:41:48.149 --> 01:41:50.276
But the thing that
threw me off the most is

1945
01:41:50.318 --> 01:41:54.280
her brother and son's names
are still on those policies.

1946
01:41:54.322 --> 01:41:58.284
- You mean to tell me
after all these years.

1947
01:41:58.326 --> 01:42:02.080
she still have dead people
on her life insurance.

1948
01:42:02.122 --> 01:42:05.583
See. I told you she was selfish.

1949
01:42:06.543 --> 01:42:09.546
Well. go upstairs and
get the paperwork.

1950
01:42:13.049 --> 01:42:17.429
And you can just follow me up.

1951
01:42:17.470 --> 01:42:20.140
'cause I always wanted
to know what it feel like

1952
01:42:20.181 --> 01:42:23.309
to make love in a
California king bed.

1953
01:42:25.979 --> 01:42:27.355
- Wait a minute.
You a real freak.

1954
01:42:27.397 --> 01:42:30.358
I mean. you expect for me
to really have sex with you

1955
01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:32.277
knowing there's a dead
corpse in the house.

1956
01:42:32.318 --> 01:42:34.154
- [Melisende] I mean. why not?

1957
01:42:34.195 --> 01:42:36.156
It's not like
she's gonna wake up

1958
01:42:36.197 --> 01:42:38.408
and come upstairs like
"The Walking Dead."

1959
01:42:38.450 --> 01:42:41.119
- [Hudson] Oh. I
guess you right.

1960
01:42:41.161 --> 01:42:43.413
- Well. this walking
dead just did.

1961
01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:48.460
What? Go have sex
on my bed. right?

1962
01:42:48.501 --> 01:42:49.711
- Baby. what do you mean?

1963
01:42:49.753 --> 01:42:51.546
I was concerned when
you didn't wake up.

1964
01:42:51.588 --> 01:42:54.174
I was about to call the
cops or the ambulance.

1965
01:42:54.215 --> 01:42:56.593
- Oh. you need to call both

1966
01:42:56.634 --> 01:42:59.179
'cause they about
to find two bodies.

1967
01:42:59.220 --> 01:43:01.222
- What are you talking about?

1968
01:43:01.264 --> 01:43:02.724
I was really
concerned about you.

1969
01:43:02.766 --> 01:43:05.310
Melisende even suggested
you might be pregnant.

1970
01:43:05.352 --> 01:43:06.519
- [Rainey] Oh.
- Look.

1971
01:43:06.561 --> 01:43:08.271
you not in the right
state of mind right now.

1972
01:43:08.313 --> 01:43:10.357
You a little delirious. Just
lemme walk you up upstair-

1973
01:43:10.398 --> 01:43:15.153
- Don't touch me. okay? Stay
away or I will use this.

1974
01:43:15.195 --> 01:43:16.863
Okay?
- Okay.

1975
01:43:16.905 --> 01:43:21.993
- I heard what both of you
did. You of all people.

1976
01:43:23.411 --> 01:43:25.246
I loved you like a sister.

1977
01:43:26.206 --> 01:43:28.541
How could you?

1978
01:43:28.583 --> 01:43:32.796
Your own godson? What
is wrong with you?

1979
01:43:32.837 --> 01:43:34.005
- No. How could you?

1980
01:43:35.256 --> 01:43:39.135
After all these years. I
lived under your shadow.

1981
01:43:39.177 --> 01:43:42.222
with you thinking you
was better than me.

1982
01:43:42.263 --> 01:43:44.849
giving me all your
hand me downs.

1983
01:43:44.891 --> 01:43:47.852
How could I what? You crazy?

1984
01:43:49.062 --> 01:43:52.148
You forgot how I found
you a few months ago.

1985
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:54.025
You are pathetic.

1986
01:43:55.193 --> 01:43:58.530
Every man I ever had wanted you.

1987
01:43:58.571 --> 01:44:03.368
the little rich girl. daddy's
little dress me up trophy.

1988
01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:06.788
All of this shoulda been mine.

1989
01:44:08.081 --> 01:44:10.542
- So that's it? This is why?

1990
01:44:11.793 --> 01:44:14.921
This is why you murdered
my brother and my. my son?

1991
01:44:16.673 --> 01:44:18.925
I should kill you
where you stand.

1992
01:44:20.844 --> 01:44:21.970
I covered for you.

1993
01:44:23.221 --> 01:44:25.557
Your fraud. your stealing
from men. everything.

1994
01:44:25.598 --> 01:44:27.976
because you was my
sister and I loved you.

1995
01:44:30.812 --> 01:44:32.772
Your own godson. Why?

1996
01:44:35.191 --> 01:44:37.360
- Put the bottle down. Rainey

1997
01:44:37.402 --> 01:44:40.321
Lemme explain. Trust me.
this can all go away.

1998
01:44:42.157 --> 01:44:43.324
- Explain what?

1999
01:44:45.535 --> 01:44:47.537
That you murdered
my brother and son

2000
01:44:47.579 --> 01:44:49.330
and married me for the cover up?

2001
01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.376
You two are a piece of work.

2002
01:44:55.003 --> 01:44:57.505
You are both going to hell.

2003
01:44:57.547 --> 01:44:59.549
(Melisende laughing)

2004
01:44:59.591 --> 01:45:02.093
- Hell? Baby. I live in hell.

2005
01:45:04.346 --> 01:45:08.183
Coming over to your house
when I was 12 years old.

2006
01:45:08.224 --> 01:45:09.684
After your mother died.

2007
01:45:09.726 --> 01:45:12.354
your dad would call my
drunk alcoholic mother

2008
01:45:12.395 --> 01:45:14.022
to come over and help you.

2009
01:45:15.398 --> 01:45:20.320
But instead. he was helping
himself when you fall asleep.

2010
01:45:20.362 --> 01:45:26.117
So that virginity that was
broken. was by your daddy.

2011
01:45:26.159 --> 01:45:28.328
The Mr. Righteous Man Of God.

2012
01:45:28.370 --> 01:45:30.330
- So this. that's it?

2013
01:45:30.372 --> 01:45:35.043
So this is why you killed
my son? Your godson?

2014
01:45:36.670 --> 01:45:40.340
Why? What did he do to you?

2015
01:45:40.382 --> 01:45:43.176
- You better be glad I
saved you the heartache.

2016
01:45:43.218 --> 01:45:45.720
He was gonna be soft
just like your brother.

2017
01:45:45.762 --> 01:45:48.848
He was twisting around here
harder than me and you.

2018
01:45:48.890 --> 01:45:52.686
- You are sick and
I'm gonna kill you.

2019
01:45:52.727 --> 01:45:55.105
- No. I can't let you-
- Lemme go!

2020
01:45:55.146 --> 01:45:55.897
Lemme go!

2021
01:45:57.065 --> 01:45:58.108
- Look. we still got
the drugs in there.

2022
01:45:58.149 --> 01:45:59.025
We need to make her drink.

2023
01:45:59.067 --> 01:45:59.984
- What?
- Right now.

2024
01:46:00.026 --> 01:46:01.986
- What? Somebody help me!

2025
01:46:03.405 --> 01:46:04.864
Somebody help me!

2026
01:46:04.906 --> 01:46:08.576
- Somebody help me.
somebody help me. Shut up!

2027
01:46:09.786 --> 01:46:14.165
You forgot you put soundproof
doors and windows in here.

2028
01:46:14.207 --> 01:46:16.167
the two missing almighty.

2029
01:46:17.794 --> 01:46:20.338
because you didn't wanna hear
the hood rats riding around

2030
01:46:20.380 --> 01:46:23.049
in your precious
little neighborhood.

2031
01:46:23.091 --> 01:46:25.176
- [Hudson] We need to make
sure she drinks this wine.

2032
01:46:25.218 --> 01:46:26.553
- What?
- It's too much.

2033
01:46:26.594 --> 01:46:29.305
You gotta drink it.
- What?

2034
01:46:29.347 --> 01:46:31.641
- Hold still.
- How could you?

2035
01:46:32.517 --> 01:46:34.269
You a rich business man.

2036
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:37.480
I don't understand
what is going on.

2037
01:46:39.441 --> 01:46:44.154
- Girl. are you clueless?
Ms. Defense Attorney.

2038
01:46:44.195 --> 01:46:45.780
He is broke.

2039
01:46:46.823 --> 01:46:50.201
- What? I. I don't.
I don't understand.

2040
01:46:50.243 --> 01:46:51.327
I watch him spend the money.

2041
01:46:51.369 --> 01:46:53.246
What are you talking
about. he's broke?

2042
01:46:53.288 --> 01:46:56.791
- Girl. he did it
with all your money.

2043
01:46:56.833 --> 01:47:00.545
Have you been checking my
godson's college account?

2044
01:47:00.587 --> 01:47:03.089
The money you've been
saving since he was born.

2045
01:47:03.131 --> 01:47:06.384
Oh. let's not forget about
the $2 million your dad left

2046
01:47:06.426 --> 01:47:08.094
before the bastard died.

2047
01:47:08.136 --> 01:47:10.847
I know all your account numbers.

2048
01:47:10.889 --> 01:47:14.434
I'm your best
friend. your sister.

2049
01:47:14.476 --> 01:47:16.436
you put me on as a signer

2050
01:47:16.478 --> 01:47:19.105
in case if anything
ever happened to you.

2051
01:47:23.443 --> 01:47:24.778
- Take another step.

2052
01:47:26.279 --> 01:47:29.115
Please do. Who's the trick now?

2053
01:47:30.700 --> 01:47:33.286
And don't you ever put
your hands on her again

2054
01:47:33.328 --> 01:47:35.038
or I shoot you right
where you stand.

2055
01:47:36.164 --> 01:47:40.126
- Trudy. shoot them both.
They killed Logan and Evan.

2056
01:47:41.252 --> 01:47:47.592
- Ms. Brown. put the gun down.
We here now. We got this.

2057
01:47:47.634 --> 01:47:49.469
- [Trudy] Least lemme
pistol whip this trick.

2058
01:47:49.511 --> 01:47:51.304
I owe her at least that.

2059
01:47:51.346 --> 01:47:54.265
- Ms. Brown. hand
me the gun now.

2060
01:47:54.307 --> 01:47:56.768
- Mm. I'm gonna give it to you.

2061
01:47:56.810 --> 01:47:59.562
but I know how you police do.

2062
01:47:59.604 --> 01:48:04.651
You keep our guns. you keep
our weed. you sell our crack.

2063
01:48:05.902 --> 01:48:07.862
but this right here. this
my Grandma Katie May's gun.

2064
01:48:09.364 --> 01:48:10.699
I'mma give it to you.

2065
01:48:13.201 --> 01:48:14.536
but I want it back.

2066
01:48:16.371 --> 01:48:18.415
- Detectives. these
two are the ones

2067
01:48:18.456 --> 01:48:20.500
that killed Logan and Evan.

2068
01:48:20.542 --> 01:48:22.377
Please get them outta here.

2069
01:48:22.419 --> 01:48:23.878
- He made me do it.

2070
01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:26.131
He said if I didn't do
it. he would kill me.

2071
01:48:27.298 --> 01:48:30.802
- Are you okay. Ms. Storms?
Do you need medical attention?

2072
01:48:30.844 --> 01:48:34.389
- No. Just please get
them outta my house.

2073
01:48:34.431 --> 01:48:36.850
- I understand how
you feel. Believe me.

2074
01:48:36.891 --> 01:48:38.852
They go away for a long time.

2075
01:48:38.893 --> 01:48:42.188
Detective Gavin. get Mr. Dennis
and Ms. Carter outta here.

2076
01:48:42.230 --> 01:48:43.606
I need to make the report.

2077
01:48:43.648 --> 01:48:44.774
- [Detective Stonewall] Put
your hands behind you back.

2078
01:48:44.816 --> 01:48:47.444
- Dennis? His name
is Hudson Wheeler.

2079
01:48:47.485 --> 01:48:48.653
- No. Ms. Storms.

2080
01:48:48.695 --> 01:48:50.488
His name is Dennis Carter.

2081
01:48:50.530 --> 01:48:52.157
Ms. Carter here
criminal husband.

2082
01:48:52.198 --> 01:48:52.907
- What?

2083
01:48:54.367 --> 01:48:55.577
- Yeah.

2084
01:48:58.413 --> 01:49:00.749
- Put hands behind your back.

2085
01:49:00.790 --> 01:49:03.585
Both of y'all gon' be gone
for a long time. Let's go.

2086
01:49:08.798 --> 01:49:13.470
- [Rainey] Detective. how
did you know to come here?

2087
01:49:13.511 --> 01:49:14.888
- [Detective Smith] You
got Ms. Brown to thank.

2088
01:49:14.929 --> 01:49:16.598
She was your lifesaver tonight.

2089
01:49:17.766 --> 01:49:22.645
- [Trudy] I'll fill her in.
* Isn't He holy

2090
01:49:26.191 --> 01:49:29.986
* Jesus

2091
01:49:30.028 --> 01:49:31.946
* Jesus

2092
01:49:34.407 --> 01:49:37.118
- So. girl. you sure you okay?

2093
01:49:38.161 --> 01:49:39.913
Maybe we should listen
to the detective

2094
01:49:39.954 --> 01:49:42.540
and actually went to the
hospital and got you checked.

2095
01:49:42.582 --> 01:49:44.918
- Mm-mm. No. I'm okay.

2096
01:49:44.959 --> 01:49:50.924
I just. I really need to
process all of this and relax.

2097
01:49:50.965 --> 01:49:54.552
Melisende. after
all these years.

2098
01:49:54.594 --> 01:49:59.724
hated me because of what
my father did to her.

2099
01:49:59.766 --> 01:50:03.561
and punished my
brother and my son.

2100
01:50:03.603 --> 01:50:05.855
I just. I don't know. I...

2101
01:50:08.274 --> 01:50:09.734
I don't understand.

2102
01:50:10.944 --> 01:50:13.446
- Well. you know. sometimes
we love people so hard

2103
01:50:13.488 --> 01:50:16.533
and so deep that we
don't even see the evil

2104
01:50:16.574 --> 01:50:18.159
that's really within them.

2105
01:50:19.744 --> 01:50:23.289
- How did you know to come
here with the detectives?

2106
01:50:23.331 --> 01:50:26.001
- Okay. so listen.

2107
01:50:26.042 --> 01:50:29.379
remember. you called my phone
and you didn't say anything

2108
01:50:29.421 --> 01:50:31.297
for like 20. 25 minutes.

2109
01:50:31.339 --> 01:50:35.552
You know me. I'm nosy.
So I stayed on the line.

2110
01:50:35.593 --> 01:50:37.887
So then I heard your husband say

2111
01:50:39.347 --> 01:50:41.307
that you were dead.

2112
01:50:41.349 --> 01:50:43.268
but he was talking to somebody.

2113
01:50:43.309 --> 01:50:45.311
So again. I'm still listening.

2114
01:50:46.396 --> 01:50:49.149
So then I heard Melisende
say exactly what she did

2115
01:50:49.190 --> 01:50:50.483
to your father.

2116
01:50:50.525 --> 01:50:53.153
to you and your kids.

2117
01:50:53.194 --> 01:50:55.655
Then I knew it was
going on. So what I do?

2118
01:50:55.697 --> 01:50:57.490
Girl. I got in my car.

2119
01:50:57.532 --> 01:50:58.825
I didn't wanna hang up.

2120
01:50:58.867 --> 01:51:01.244
so I drove straight to
the closest pay. pay.

2121
01:51:01.286 --> 01:51:03.830
what is it. payphone
thing. booth. girl.

2122
01:51:03.872 --> 01:51:05.331
get. went in there.

2123
01:51:05.373 --> 01:51:08.710
called the detective that
left the card at the office.

2124
01:51:08.752 --> 01:51:10.170
Told her where I
was gonna be at.

2125
01:51:10.211 --> 01:51:13.673
And I headed to you. When I
got there. you weren't there.

2126
01:51:13.715 --> 01:51:17.635
I mean. I'm sorry. they
weren't there. So what I do?

2127
01:51:17.677 --> 01:51:19.679
I reached down in my
glove compartment.

2128
01:51:19.721 --> 01:51:21.639
pulled old out old
Katie May's gun.

2129
01:51:21.681 --> 01:51:23.808
Girl. I came in
to save my friend.

2130
01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:27.729
- Thank you. You saved my life.

2131
01:51:29.606 --> 01:51:35.320
- Girl. no. this is all
God's will. Trust me.

2132
01:51:35.362 --> 01:51:36.696
And now. honestly.

2133
01:51:36.738 --> 01:51:39.199
thank God for those new
phones you put in that office

2134
01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:41.993
that hold up to 12
hours of conversation.

2135
01:51:42.035 --> 01:51:42.744
Got that.

2136
01:51:44.162 --> 01:51:46.623
- I'm glad you was nosy enough
not to hang up the phone.

2137
01:51:46.664 --> 01:51:47.874
- Girl. you know I'm nosy.

2138
01:51:47.916 --> 01:51:51.044
- So you got all
of the confession?

2139
01:51:52.504 --> 01:51:56.758
- I had them on the two-way
listening the whole entire time.

2140
01:51:56.800 --> 01:51:59.386
Listen. Rainey. you
been through a lot

2141
01:51:59.427 --> 01:52:00.720
in the last few years.

2142
01:52:00.762 --> 01:52:03.807
The loss of your mother.
the loss of your father.

2143
01:52:03.848 --> 01:52:05.767
Evan and your son.

2144
01:52:06.601 --> 01:52:09.020
girl. only a strong woman

2145
01:52:09.062 --> 01:52:10.605
can go through the
things you been through.

2146
01:52:10.647 --> 01:52:12.941
And you the strongest
woman I know.

2147
01:52:14.234 --> 01:52:19.739
Honey. all I know now is that
the killer of my little cousin

2148
01:52:19.781 --> 01:52:20.782
is behind bar.

2149
01:52:22.742 --> 01:52:23.868
- I owe you an apology.

2150
01:52:25.453 --> 01:52:29.124
Ever since my father's passing.
I haven't been fair to you.

2151
01:52:29.165 --> 01:52:33.753
- Oh. no. Rainey. You do
not owe me no apology.

2152
01:52:33.795 --> 01:52:35.005
Look. Rainey.

2153
01:52:35.046 --> 01:52:36.798
I know that was your father.

2154
01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:39.509
and me and Evans never
told you the truth.

2155
01:52:39.551 --> 01:52:40.927
And I get that.

2156
01:52:40.969 --> 01:52:42.303
But trust me. honey.

2157
01:52:42.345 --> 01:52:43.680
I would've been
protective over my father

2158
01:52:43.722 --> 01:52:44.973
and my brother as well.

2159
01:52:47.392 --> 01:52:50.228
- I read the letter
that he wrote to you.

2160
01:52:50.270 --> 01:52:54.274
and I'm sorry that he
put you through that.

2161
01:52:54.315 --> 01:52:58.820
- It's okay. You already
know. Evan was truly my boy.

2162
01:52:58.862 --> 01:53:01.448
We would go out
dancing. singing.

2163
01:53:01.489 --> 01:53:02.699
Girl. he had me laughing.

2164
01:53:02.741 --> 01:53:04.951
especially trying to teach
me those karate moves.

2165
01:53:04.993 --> 01:53:07.120
Girl. you know I wanted to
put some moves on that old.

2166
01:53:07.162 --> 01:53:10.749
you know what. Melissa.
Melisende girl.

2167
01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:12.834
- That woulda been
a TikTok moment.

2168
01:53:12.876 --> 01:53:15.837
- Girl. what in the world
you know about some TikTok?

2169
01:53:17.213 --> 01:53:20.175
Shoot. With your
boujee yourself.

2170
01:53:21.843 --> 01:53:24.804
- I could surprise
you on what I know.

2171
01:53:24.846 --> 01:53:25.847
But for real.

2172
01:53:27.307 --> 01:53:30.185
I finally know the truth. And
I know Evan is smiling down.

2173
01:53:30.226 --> 01:53:35.357
- Mm. absolutely. Now I do
have a question for you though.

2174
01:53:36.816 --> 01:53:38.485
- [Rainey] What's that?
- Just a little question.

2175
01:53:38.526 --> 01:53:39.694
- [Rainey] What's that?

2176
01:53:39.736 --> 01:53:41.738
- Okay. after all
that you been through

2177
01:53:41.780 --> 01:53:44.366
in this whole situation.

2178
01:53:44.407 --> 01:53:45.992
do I still got a job?

2179
01:53:46.034 --> 01:53:47.786
- Do you still have a job?

2180
01:53:47.827 --> 01:53:49.204
- [Trudy] Yeah.

2181
01:53:49.245 --> 01:53:52.832
- Girl. I'm 'bout to change
that sign to my ride or die.

2182
01:53:52.874 --> 01:53:57.003
- Now. wait. Boo.
that is ghetto. That's
too ghetto for me.

2183
01:53:57.045 --> 01:54:01.841
So no. that is taken it too
far. That's ghetto. No. ma'am.

2184
01:54:01.883 --> 01:54:04.219
Mm. well. anyway. girl.

2185
01:54:04.260 --> 01:54:06.513
we need to get you
to this hospital.

2186
01:54:06.554 --> 01:54:09.349
'Cause like the detectives
said. to make sure you straight.

2187
01:54:09.391 --> 01:54:10.850
you all in the clear.

2188
01:54:10.892 --> 01:54:13.395
So. and we also need to stop
by the police department

2189
01:54:13.436 --> 01:54:16.189
to get you to (speaker
mumbles) that report.

2190
01:54:16.231 --> 01:54:17.691
But you wanna stop and
get a drink before we go.

2191
01:54:17.732 --> 01:54:19.150
a glass of wine?
