00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:27.402
(knocking)

5
00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:33.199
Buenos dias!
(gasping)

6
00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:36.453
Don't tell me you fell
asleep in here again.

7
00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:38.788
How long has it been since you
actually put on your pajamas

8
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.040
and slept in your bed?

9
00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:42.542
You truly are a godsend.

10
00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:44.210
I'm serious. Charlotte.

11
00:00:44.252 --> 00:00:47.130
You can't live like this.
it's not healthy.

12
00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:49.591
Well. I don't have
time to sleep. okay?

13
00:00:49.632 --> 00:00:51.384
Sales are slowing down.

14
00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:53.261
I have to create
a new collection quick

15
00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:56.222
before everyone just forgets
about Alistair altogether.

16
00:00:56.264 --> 00:00:58.475
Every luxury brand is
slowing down right now.

17
00:00:58.516 --> 00:00:59.768
It's inflation.

18
00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.644
Prices are too high for people.

19
00:01:01.686 --> 00:01:03.938
But that doesn't change the fact
that I haven't created anything

20
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.774
new or worthwhile since April.

21
00:01:05.815 --> 00:01:09.402
Well. it's probably very hard
to get inspired when you

22
00:01:09.444 --> 00:01:12.155
don't go out and socialize
with humans every now and then.

23
00:01:12.197 --> 00:01:13.948
Hey. I socialize.

24
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.200
I talk to you every day.

25
00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:17.160
I'm your seamstress.

26
00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:19.454
You literally pay me
to talk to you every day.

27
00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:22.957
Are you sure there
is nothing in here?

28
00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:24.584
Nothing.

29
00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:27.545
Everything I draw looks more
like lounge wear than luxury.

30
00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:30.173
There is nothing
wrong with lounge wear.

31
00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:32.217
There is when you
own a luxury boutique

32
00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:34.302
and you pride
yourself on exclusive

33
00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:35.929
and cutting edge clothing.

34
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.181
Point taken.

35
00:01:38.223 --> 00:01:39.474
Shall we go open?

36
00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:43.937
Uh. change first. please.
before we go downstairs.

37
00:01:43.978 --> 00:01:54.155
*

38
00:02:01.162 --> 00:02:04.708
Did you get more silk.
by the way?

39
00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:07.544
I need to make more of
those gold tunic pieces.

40
00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:10.130
Unfortunately.
the price went up. 120 a yard.

41
00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:12.966
120? Are you kidding?

42
00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:15.010
That's going to put us
way over budget.

43
00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:16.678
The cost of being
a luxury designer.

44
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.140
Not to mention the rent's
going up in January.

45
00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:21.808
Do you have to leave me
for two whole weeks?

46
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.978
Yes. Some people spend their
holidays with their families.

47
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.480
It's a very strange concept.
I know.

48
00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:29.107
(phone ringing)

49
00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:30.775
Speaking of which.

50
00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:31.776
(phone ringing)

51
00:02:33.737 --> 00:02:35.155
Hi. Mom.

52
00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:36.823
Mom:
Oh. Charlie. You picked up.

53
00:02:36.865 --> 00:02:38.199
What's up?
Is everything okay?

54
00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:41.369
Oh. everything's fine.
It's great. actually.

55
00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:43.580
Christina and Peter's place
is still under renovation.

56
00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:46.583
so they're going to be staying
here until the new year now.

57
00:02:46.624 --> 00:02:49.336
(chuckling) It's going to be
a full house for the holidays.

58
00:02:49.377 --> 00:02:51.755
Yeah. sounds cozy.

59
00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:55.467
So. if you have time in
your busy schedule to come by

60
00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:58.178
for a night or two.
we thought it would be really

61
00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:00.638
special for us
all to be together.

62
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.060
Maybe watch some movies.
play some games. like old times.

63
00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:07.604
Mom. you know I'd love to.
but I'm just too busy right now.

64
00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:09.189
I need to be here
to man the store.

65
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.025
Mom: You can't close
for a few days?

66
00:03:12.067 --> 00:03:13.818
Mom. we've talked
about this.

67
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.653
If I close the store then
I could miss a customer.

68
00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:17.697
and every customer
matters right now.

69
00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.949
I know. I know.

70
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:21.576
I just thought I'd try.

71
00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:23.578
Would have been so nice
for us all to be together

72
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.206
for the last year
of Elfcapades.

73
00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:28.333
I know.
Maybe next year.

74
00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:31.127
Wait. Did you say the last year
of the Elfcapades?

75
00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:32.504
Mm-hm.
I thought I told you.

76
00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:34.714
What-- No. why is it
the last year?

77
00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:35.965
Dee Dee?

78
00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:37.050
Charlie.

79
00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:38.176
Tell her I said hi.

80
00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:39.219
Rick says hi.

81
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.762
Honey. I've gotta go.

82
00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:43.890
Rick and I are going
cross-country skiing.

83
00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:47.268
Please. just think about
making the trip. okay?

84
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.229
I'll make your
favorite ginger loaf.

85
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.356
(chuckling)
Maybe next year.

86
00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:53.233
I'll talk to you later.
Love you.

87
00:03:53.274 --> 00:03:54.484
Mom:
Love you too. Char.

88
00:03:56.945 --> 00:03:58.238
What?

89
00:03:58.279 --> 00:03:59.739
You're seriously not
going home for Christmas

90
00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:02.492
because you're afraid you're
going to miss a customer?

91
00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:05.412
You do realize 80% of our sales
come from the website. right?

92
00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:08.039
Well. someone has to
be here for the other 20.

93
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.250
(scoffs)
Is there some other reason

94
00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:11.418
you're avoiding going home

95
00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.378
or you're just
a complete Scrooge?

96
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.172
I'm not a Scrooge.
I'm just focused.

97
00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:18.008
I have worked really
hard for 10 years

98
00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.384
trying to put
Alistair on the map.

99
00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:20.885
- I'm not slowing down now.
- (shop bell dings)

100
00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:22.345
If you say so.

101
00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:25.890
If you'll excuse me.
I have a customer to attend to.

102
00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:27.142
Hi. welcome to Alistair.

103
00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:28.685
Is there anything
I can help you with?

104
00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:38.695
*

105
00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.091
(pipes rattling)

106
00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:06.097
Great. Just great.

107
00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:09.059
No water.

108
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.479
*

109
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.190
Yes. we're hoping to have
a spring collection ready

110
00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:17.901
for New York Fashion Week
in February.

111
00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:21.488
Absolutely. yeah.
We'll work right on that.

112
00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:24.991
Uh. can I call you
right back?

113
00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:27.911
- (water dripping)
- Margo: Charlotte. finally.

114
00:05:27.952 --> 00:05:29.829
Wh-- What is happening here?

115
00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:32.499
Uh--

116
00:05:34.376 --> 00:05:36.503
Why are my garments
completely drenched?

117
00:05:36.544 --> 00:05:38.588
A pipe burst.
It's an old building.

118
00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.006
It was bound to happen.

119
00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:41.966
"Bound to happen?"

120
00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:43.426
This is my livelihood.

121
00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:45.637
I need to sell these
in order to pay you rent.

122
00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:47.389
Well. don't you have
any extras in the back?

123
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.600
Extras?
No. we are a boutique.

124
00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:53.895
Each garment is hand-stitched
and one-of-a-kind.

125
00:05:53.937 --> 00:05:55.146
That's not very efficient.

126
00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:57.607
(sighing)
This is a disaster.

127
00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:59.609
How long is this
going to take to clean up?

128
00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:01.277
Well. the plumber said
there's significant damage.

129
00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:03.530
so you're gonna have to close up
and leave for the next week

130
00:06:03.571 --> 00:06:04.698
so I can take care of it.

131
00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:07.200
A week?
Are you kidding me?

132
00:06:07.242 --> 00:06:09.035
Do I look
like I'm kidding you?

133
00:06:09.077 --> 00:06:11.287
Wh-- Where am I
supposed to go?

134
00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:13.373
Well. don't you have friends
and family you can stay with?

135
00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:15.083
What about staying with Margo?

136
00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:16.251
I'm renting out
my place while me

137
00:06:16.292 --> 00:06:18.420
and my family are in Colorado.

138
00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:19.879
Sorry. Charlotte.
but unless you want to live

139
00:06:19.921 --> 00:06:22.257
in a place with no running
water for the next week.

140
00:06:22.298 --> 00:06:23.216
you better figure it out.

141
00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:24.634
(sighing)

142
00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:27.637
It's ruined.

143
00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:30.432
- (thudding)
- (gasping)

144
00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:33.143
Sorry.

145
00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:35.603
(whirring)

146
00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:37.605
- (sighing)
- (turning off hairdryer)

147
00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:39.733
I'm so sorry. Charlotte.

148
00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:41.776
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

149
00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:44.279
I don't have the money
to replace all this fabric.

150
00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.364
This is a catastrophe.

151
00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:47.574
We'll figure it out.

152
00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:52.120
I don't know if Alistair's
going to bounce back from this.

153
00:06:52.162 --> 00:06:54.831
Come on. we just have to
pray for a Christmas miracle.

154
00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:56.541
Aren't you Jewish?

155
00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:59.711
Okay. fine.
A Hanukkah miracle.

156
00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:02.172
Either way.
I believe in miracles.

157
00:07:02.213 --> 00:07:03.631
especially this time
of year.

158
00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:05.091
Well. that makes one of us.

159
00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:06.551
(phone ringing)

160
00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:08.511
Oh. maybe this
is the insurance.

161
00:07:09.804 --> 00:07:11.097
Hello.

162
00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:12.140
Yes. this is her.

163
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.143
Uh-huh.

164
00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:17.062
Wait. What?

165
00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:18.438
Warwick's Christmas Challenge?

166
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.857
But I never applied--

167
00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:28.156
Tomorrow? Uh. yes.

168
00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:30.075
Two o'clock?

169
00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:32.243
Okay. great.
Thank you.

170
00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:36.456
Did you submit Alistair for

171
00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:38.124
the Warwick's Christmas
Design Challenge?

172
00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:39.668
Did you just get accepted?

173
00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:41.378
They said one of their
designers had to drop out

174
00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:44.756
for personal reasons so they're
looking at me to fill the spot.

175
00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:46.925
I have a meeting with
Roger Warwick tomorrow

176
00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:48.218
to discuss details.

177
00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:50.178
- What?
- (laughing)

178
00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.471
That's amazing!

179
00:07:51.513 --> 00:07:53.973
You could be
the next Donna Karan.

180
00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:56.184
I can't believe you
applied without telling me!

181
00:07:56.226 --> 00:07:59.771
I knew the word "Christmas"
would turn you off.

182
00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:02.315
You're so talented.
Charlotte.

183
00:08:02.357 --> 00:08:04.734
The world deserves
to see what you can do.

184
00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:07.529
Christmas garb or otherwise.

185
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.657
Roger: We loved your brand
right from the get-go.

186
00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:13.910
Fabulous designs.
great social media.

187
00:08:13.952 --> 00:08:16.121
The reason we didn't
choose you right away

188
00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:19.207
is that we felt your design
style just didn't match

189
00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:20.417
this year's challenge.

190
00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:22.419
Oh?

191
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.504
Why? What is the challenge
this year?

192
00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:27.674
It's to design
two holiday outfits.

193
00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:29.968
One for a female buyer.
one for a male buyer.

194
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.386
It's for our home
and family brand.

195
00:08:31.428 --> 00:08:33.138
Home and family?

196
00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:36.099
Yeah. it's actually our most
popular clothing division.

197
00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:39.519
It's affordable.
it's inclusive. family-oriented.

198
00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:42.147
But I design luxury pieces.

199
00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:44.024
Exactly.

200
00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:45.817
We thought you might
actually bring something special

201
00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:47.110
to this year's challenge.

202
00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:48.987
How much time would I have?

203
00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:51.614
So. we do a fashion show
Christmas Eve.

204
00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:53.658
Wow. that's. uh...

205
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.368
that's eight days away.

206
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.705
It is. and.
as you know.

207
00:08:58.747 --> 00:09:01.833
the winner gets their design
sold in all of our stores

208
00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:04.627
right across the nation.
as well.

209
00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:06.588
you continue to design for us
for the entire year.

210
00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:09.090
- Wow. really?
- Mm-hm.

211
00:09:09.132 --> 00:09:10.550
That's incredible.

212
00:09:10.592 --> 00:09:12.719
So. the only question is...

213
00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:15.096
are you up
for the challenge?

214
00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:17.557
Because there's a lot of other
designers here in New York City

215
00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:19.017
that would love to be
sitting in your seat.

216
00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:21.478
Uh. no.
I-- I'm definitely interested.

217
00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:22.854
Roger:
Fantastic.

218
00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:25.607
Here are the models
that we will be designing for.

219
00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:28.651
and their specs are on
the back of the picture.

220
00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:31.488
Well. great.

221
00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:33.114
Thank you so much.

222
00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:34.449
I will not disappoint.

223
00:09:34.491 --> 00:09:36.368
Nice to meet you.
and we'll see you Christmas Eve.

224
00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:37.619
Excellent.

225
00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:39.662
Thank you.

226
00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:43.375
Margo:
Home and family.

227
00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:44.834
Wow. that's huge.

228
00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:46.920
I know. but he says
he needs the designs

229
00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:51.758
to be festive. inclusive.
affordable. and family-oriented.

230
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.761
So. Alistair's polar opposite.

231
00:09:54.803 --> 00:09:58.098
Yup. but winning this
competition

232
00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:00.642
would push my career to
a whole new level.

233
00:10:00.684 --> 00:10:04.104
I'll design baby bonnets.
I am desperate for a win.

234
00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:07.357
I'm so sorry.
I can't even help you sew.

235
00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:10.193
Oh. that's okay. I only
have to design two outfits.

236
00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:11.778
I think I can manage.

237
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.780
So. when are
you going home?

238
00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:15.407
What do you mean?

239
00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:17.992
What do you mean
what do I mean?

240
00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:20.245
You're not planning on staying
here without water. are you?

241
00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:22.622
Well. no. but--

242
00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:24.332
Uh. but what. Charlotte?

243
00:10:24.374 --> 00:10:28.211
You're designing Christmas
attire for home and family.

244
00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:30.005
Don't you think it
might be beneficial

245
00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:33.299
to go spend Christmas
at home with your family?

246
00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:34.300
It's just--

247
00:10:34.342 --> 00:10:37.012
It's just what?

248
00:10:39.097 --> 00:10:40.598
You're right.

249
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:44.728
I can't afford an AirBnB at
this time of year anyway. So...

250
00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:47.689
Brooksbend it is. I guess.

251
00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:49.524
Hallelujah!

252
00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:51.317
This will be
so good for you.

253
00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:52.527
I just know it.

254
00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:53.737
Mm-hm.

255
00:10:55.196 --> 00:10:57.991
Radio Host #1: You know.
this might be my favorite night

256
00:10:58.033 --> 00:10:59.534
of Elfcapades.

257
00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:01.494
I mean. cookies. hot chocolate.
Christmas carols. Come on.

258
00:11:01.536 --> 00:11:02.787
Radio Host #2: Right.

259
00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:04.664
My kids are really gonna
miss it next year.

260
00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:06.624
Radio Host #1:
Oh. tell me about it.

261
00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:08.793
I guess we'll just have to go
all out for the next seven days

262
00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:10.420
and make
Gregory Carmichael proud.

263
00:11:10.462 --> 00:11:11.504
Radio Host #2:
Here. here!

264
00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:13.381
Radio Host #1:
Okay. let's do it.

265
00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:14.549
- (gasping)
- (tires squealing)

266
00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:15.967
(smashing)

267
00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:18.303
(sighing)

268
00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:30.774
I am so sorry. I--

269
00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:33.735
I was completely daydreaming
and not paying attention.

270
00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:37.697
That's not ideal when you're
behind the wheel of a vehicle.

271
00:11:37.739 --> 00:11:39.866
I know. I'm a little
out of sorts today.

272
00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:42.535
I've been driving the past
four hours from Manhattan.

273
00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:45.455
Ah. city girl.
That explains it.

274
00:11:45.497 --> 00:11:47.248
What's that supposed
to mean?

275
00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:48.583
Were you texting?

276
00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:50.293
What?

277
00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:52.504
No. Stereotype much?

278
00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:56.049
Well. lucky for you
mine's okay.

279
00:11:56.091 --> 00:11:58.176
So. you're just going to have
to worry about your own there.

280
00:11:58.218 --> 00:12:01.137
Oh. come on.

281
00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:02.138
Oh!

282
00:12:04.349 --> 00:12:06.142
Well. that's a great start.

283
00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:08.269
(sighing)

284
00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:09.896
Tell you what.

285
00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:11.272
Why don't you
follow me to my shop

286
00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:13.024
and I'll take care of it?

287
00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:14.734
Your shop?

288
00:12:14.776 --> 00:12:16.695
I'm a mechanic.

289
00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:19.447
Oh. and here I was
thinking your coveralls

290
00:12:19.489 --> 00:12:20.907
was a personal
fashion choice.

291
00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:24.911
Follow me
and I'll take you home after.

292
00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:26.538
I got this.
Here. Just watch out.

293
00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:36.548
*

294
00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:49.144
I remember this place.

295
00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:51.563
This used to be
Joe Segal's right?

296
00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:54.107
Uh. you know. I don't know.
It was vacant when I got here.

297
00:12:54.149 --> 00:12:55.859
I'm actually new
to Brooksbend.

298
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:59.320
Oh. wow. So. you actually
chose to live here.

299
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.032
Why?

300
00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:05.952
Because it's so welcoming
and homey.

301
00:13:05.994 --> 00:13:07.954
Everyone here is really
family and community focused.

302
00:13:07.996 --> 00:13:10.457
People have been
so kind to me.

303
00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:12.375
I can't imagine why
anyone would want to leave.

304
00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:14.627
Mm.
Three words for you.

305
00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:16.755
New York City.

306
00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:18.631
Two words for you.

307
00:13:18.673 --> 00:13:20.383
Hard pass.

308
00:13:20.425 --> 00:13:22.093
Hm.

309
00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:24.304
Besides. bet the city doesn't
have twelve days of Elfcapades.

310
00:13:24.346 --> 00:13:25.680
You ever heard of it?

311
00:13:25.722 --> 00:13:27.223
I grew up going.

312
00:13:27.265 --> 00:13:28.725
Really?

313
00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:31.061
I'm actually volunteering with
the Elfcapades this year.

314
00:13:32.979 --> 00:13:34.481
Are you on probation?

315
00:13:34.522 --> 00:13:38.360
No. I-- I just like how
it brings people together.

316
00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:39.694
(snorting)

317
00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:41.363
What?

318
00:13:41.404 --> 00:13:45.200
Nothing. Just sounds like you're
on an after-school special.

319
00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:47.369
Wow.

320
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:49.579
You're really defying
the whole cold-hearted

321
00:13:49.621 --> 00:13:52.207
city slicker
stereotype here.

322
00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:54.000
Yeah. it's not
my thing anymore.

323
00:13:54.042 --> 00:13:56.670
It's a little
too much... Christmas.

324
00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:58.797
That's sort of the point.

325
00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:01.508
Well. as much fun
as this is.

326
00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:04.969
we should get going before my
mom sends out the authorities.

327
00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:06.930
Right. yeah.
Let's get you home.

328
00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:08.264
Just have to get my bag.

329
00:14:08.306 --> 00:14:09.265
Oh. okay. yeah.

330
00:14:09.307 --> 00:14:19.275
*

331
00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:27.534
Thank you for the ride.

332
00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:28.868
Yeah. no problem.

333
00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.745
And how long do you think
the repairs will take?

334
00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:32.455
Oh. it'll just
take a couple days.

335
00:14:32.497 --> 00:14:34.624
Thank you. uh...

336
00:14:34.666 --> 00:14:35.709
Spencer.

337
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.502
- Spencer.
- Yeah.

338
00:14:37.544 --> 00:14:38.545
Right.

339
00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:41.131
Well. merry Christmas.

340
00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:50.515
Hello?

341
00:14:51.933 --> 00:14:54.310
Mom? Christina?

342
00:14:55.937 --> 00:14:59.107
Oh. Charlie. You're here!
You're really here.

343
00:14:59.149 --> 00:15:00.817
- Oh. I can't believe it.
- (laughing)

344
00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:02.610
Is it really you?

345
00:15:02.652 --> 00:15:05.196
Well. I'm not an apparition.
so I think it's really me.

346
00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:07.490
Aw. you look tired.
Are you getting enough sleep?

347
00:15:07.532 --> 00:15:08.908
Yes. I'm fine. Mom.

348
00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:10.035
Auntie Charlie!

349
00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:12.203
Hey. buddy.
Look at you.

350
00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:14.080
You're so tall.
How did that happen?

351
00:15:14.122 --> 00:15:15.582
Oh. it's called
the passage of time.

352
00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:17.334
And I eat a lot
of broccoli.

353
00:15:17.375 --> 00:15:18.626
That. too.

354
00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:19.878
- Hi. Chris.
- Come here.

355
00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:21.129
Char. it's great
to see you.

356
00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:22.922
but I had 10 bucks down
that you wouldn't show.

357
00:15:22.964 --> 00:15:25.175
I appreciate that.
Pete. thank you.

358
00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:27.510
Okay. who's ready to go?

359
00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:28.845
Me. me. me!

360
00:15:28.887 --> 00:15:30.638
Charlotte. hi.
Welcome home.

361
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.140
Uh. where are you going?

362
00:15:32.182 --> 00:15:34.434
Well. Elfcapades. silly.

363
00:15:34.476 --> 00:15:36.770
It's the cookie
and cocoa crawl tonight!

364
00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:38.104
Dee Dee's is our first stop.

365
00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:40.231
Oh. well.
you guys have fun.

366
00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:41.941
I have to unpack
and start sketching.

367
00:15:41.983 --> 00:15:43.276
but we'll catch up tomorrow.

368
00:15:43.318 --> 00:15:44.611
What? Come on.

369
00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:46.404
This was always your
favorite of the Elfcapades.

370
00:15:46.446 --> 00:15:49.324
I know. but I have
a lot of work to do.

371
00:15:49.366 --> 00:15:51.951
This opportunity I have with
Warwick's is once in a lifetime.

372
00:15:51.993 --> 00:15:53.745
So. I'm sorry.

373
00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:56.915
So. you came all this way to
just keep ignoring us for work?

374
00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:58.625
Christina.

375
00:15:58.667 --> 00:16:01.670
You sure you're just not
scared of bumping into Evan?

376
00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:03.546
I told you not
to bring that up.

377
00:16:03.588 --> 00:16:05.882
Peter: I can throw him out
if he's there.

378
00:16:05.924 --> 00:16:08.176
Ben and I just got
our blue belts in karate.

379
00:16:08.218 --> 00:16:09.386
Hiya!

380
00:16:09.427 --> 00:16:10.345
(laughing)

381
00:16:10.387 --> 00:16:11.429
Wah!

382
00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:12.806
Well. that's very
nice of you guys.

383
00:16:12.847 --> 00:16:14.224
but it's been four years.

384
00:16:14.265 --> 00:16:15.725
I think I can handle
seeing him.

385
00:16:15.767 --> 00:16:18.603
Well. it would really mean
a lot if you came. Charlie.

386
00:16:18.645 --> 00:16:19.896
Even just for an hour.

387
00:16:19.938 --> 00:16:20.980
(sighing)

388
00:16:21.022 --> 00:16:22.649
Please. Auntie Charlie?

389
00:16:22.691 --> 00:16:24.150
(groaning)

390
00:16:25.527 --> 00:16:28.154
All right. just give me
a minute to unpack.

391
00:16:28.196 --> 00:16:29.280
Yay!

392
00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:38.289
*

393
00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:42.711
Thanks for coming.
and merry Christmas.

394
00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:44.295
(chuckling)

395
00:16:47.799 --> 00:16:49.009
Dee Dee?

396
00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:52.470
Well. look at all
these wonderful faces.

397
00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:55.974
And you.
I feel like we've met before.

398
00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:57.100
Mm...

399
00:16:57.142 --> 00:16:58.685
It's Aunt Charlie!

400
00:16:58.727 --> 00:17:00.395
Oh. my goodness.
Charlie.

401
00:17:01.479 --> 00:17:02.689
Hi. Aunt Dee Dee.

402
00:17:02.731 --> 00:17:06.276
I spy some gingerbread
cookies at two o'clock.

403
00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:07.527
Get 'em
while they're hot.

404
00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:08.987
Cookies!

405
00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:11.865
Welcome home. kiddo.

406
00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:13.867
Oh. it's been
way too long.

407
00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:16.619
This is a great turnout.

408
00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:18.413
You know.
I wasn't sure what to expect.

409
00:17:18.455 --> 00:17:20.540
but so many people
are still participating.

410
00:17:20.582 --> 00:17:23.251
It just keeps growing.
year after year.

411
00:17:23.293 --> 00:17:25.211
Your dad would be delighted.

412
00:17:25.253 --> 00:17:27.130
But then why
is it ending?

413
00:17:27.172 --> 00:17:30.008
The town decided to
take back the funding.

414
00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:31.092
I tried to stop them.

415
00:17:31.134 --> 00:17:32.427
but they had
their minds made up.

416
00:17:32.469 --> 00:17:34.137
Something to do with
allocating the money

417
00:17:34.179 --> 00:17:35.430
to a new community project.

418
00:17:35.472 --> 00:17:37.515
Well. that doesn't
make any sense.

419
00:17:37.557 --> 00:17:39.893
I mean. people love it.
It's tradition.

420
00:17:39.934 --> 00:17:42.103
My dad wanted
it to keep going.

421
00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:47.067
I know. We'll have to find
a new way to honor him.

422
00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:49.778
Charlotte Carmichael.
Oh. my God.

423
00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:51.946
I haven't
seen you in ages. girl.

424
00:17:51.988 --> 00:17:54.115
Oh. Gwen. hi!

425
00:17:54.157 --> 00:17:56.743
Can you believe that
it has been 10 years

426
00:17:56.785 --> 00:17:58.078
since we graduated
high school?

427
00:17:58.119 --> 00:18:00.121
God. it feels
just like yesterday

428
00:18:00.163 --> 00:18:03.249
we were roaming
around the hallways. huh?

429
00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:05.585
O-M-G. He's here.

430
00:18:05.627 --> 00:18:06.920
How does my hair look?

431
00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:08.088
Uh. wha-- Who's here?

432
00:18:08.129 --> 00:18:10.423
Oh. my God.
Is my make-up okay?

433
00:18:10.465 --> 00:18:12.175
How's my breath?
(blowing)

434
00:18:12.217 --> 00:18:14.135
Uh it's very minty.

435
00:18:14.177 --> 00:18:16.763
But who are you--

436
00:18:16.805 --> 00:18:18.682
- You.
- You.

437
00:18:18.723 --> 00:18:20.558
Hi. Spencer.

438
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.521
Um. can I get you a cookie
or a beverage?

439
00:18:24.562 --> 00:18:26.606
Uh. I'm okay right now.
but thank you.

440
00:18:26.648 --> 00:18:30.527
Okay. If you need anything.
just ask.

441
00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:33.988
I'm. uh.
happy to be of service.

442
00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:36.282
I will. yeah.
For sure. Thank you.

443
00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:44.374
Uh. well.
that was... interesting.

444
00:18:44.416 --> 00:18:46.126
Every single woman
in town is after him.

445
00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:49.379
Wow. Lucky you.

446
00:18:49.421 --> 00:18:51.006
Have you decided who
you're going to give

447
00:18:51.047 --> 00:18:53.466
the final rose
of the night to?

448
00:18:53.508 --> 00:18:55.135
(chuckling)

449
00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:56.678
What can I help you
with tonight. Dee?

450
00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.180
Well. you can either
help serve with Gwen.

451
00:18:59.222 --> 00:19:01.558
or decorate a new
batch in the back.

452
00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:02.684
Up to you. doll.

453
00:19:03.852 --> 00:19:04.811
I'll be in the back.

454
00:19:06.104 --> 00:19:07.188
Pleasure as always.

455
00:19:09.107 --> 00:19:10.984
How do you two
know each other?

456
00:19:11.026 --> 00:19:12.318
I hit him with my car today.

457
00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.404
That's one way
to meet new people.

458
00:19:14.446 --> 00:19:17.657
I'm gonna slip into the back.
Make yourself at home.

459
00:19:17.699 --> 00:19:18.700
Thanks. Dee.

460
00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:22.787
Ugh.

461
00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:28.835
Uh...

462
00:19:28.877 --> 00:19:33.840
*

463
00:19:33.882 --> 00:19:34.841
Oh.

464
00:19:36.009 --> 00:19:37.552
(clearing throat)

465
00:19:37.594 --> 00:19:38.845
You look like
you just saw a ghost.

466
00:19:38.887 --> 00:19:40.096
(sighing)

467
00:19:40.138 --> 00:19:41.806
Ghost of Christmas Past
to be specific.

468
00:19:41.848 --> 00:19:43.516
An ex?

469
00:19:43.558 --> 00:19:45.101
Ding-ding.

470
00:19:45.143 --> 00:19:47.145
Mm. Yeah. that's one of
the drawbacks

471
00:19:47.187 --> 00:19:48.104
about being in a small town.

472
00:19:48.146 --> 00:19:49.481
One of many.

473
00:19:51.733 --> 00:19:53.193
Here.

474
00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:54.486
Take your mind off it.

475
00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.366
Surprised to see you here.

476
00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:01.201
Thought Christmas
wasn't your thing.

477
00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:03.828
Well. it's important
to my family.

478
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.081
My dad was actually the one
who started the Elfcapades

479
00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:08.208
30 years ago.

480
00:20:08.249 --> 00:20:10.126
You're kidding.

481
00:20:10.168 --> 00:20:12.420
Your dad
was Gregory Carmichael?

482
00:20:12.462 --> 00:20:13.380
Mm-hm.

483
00:20:14.673 --> 00:20:17.384
Well. that would make
you Dee Dee's niece.

484
00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:19.094
You're the-- the one
she's always talking about.

485
00:20:19.135 --> 00:20:20.512
The big fashion
designer in New York.

486
00:20:20.553 --> 00:20:23.473
(chuckling) I don't know
about a big fashion designer.

487
00:20:23.515 --> 00:20:25.433
but it's getting there.

488
00:20:25.475 --> 00:20:26.935
I'm actually a contestant

489
00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:28.520
in the Warwick's Design
Christmas Challenge this year.

490
00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:30.897
and if I win they're
going to sell my designs

491
00:20:30.939 --> 00:20:32.857
in all
their department stores.

492
00:20:32.899 --> 00:20:35.110
Wow. that's a big deal.

493
00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:36.319
Even I know Warwick's.

494
00:20:36.361 --> 00:20:39.239
The only problem is
is I have one week

495
00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.408
to design
two holiday garments.

496
00:20:41.449 --> 00:20:42.742
It's just not enough time.

497
00:20:42.784 --> 00:20:44.828
Eh. you can do it.

498
00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:48.748
You have no idea how hard it is
to design an original garment.

499
00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:50.417
especially one
that needs to be festive

500
00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:52.752
and appeal to
the average man slash woman.

501
00:20:52.794 --> 00:20:54.379
It's completely
out of my comfort zone.

502
00:20:54.421 --> 00:20:55.797
I don't even know
where to start.

503
00:20:58.091 --> 00:20:59.759
I do. Here.

504
00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:01.302
The Elfcapades.

505
00:21:01.344 --> 00:21:04.472
There's all the festive
inspiration you could hope for.

506
00:21:04.514 --> 00:21:06.307
and. from what I can tell.

507
00:21:06.349 --> 00:21:09.102
everyone who attends is
super family-focused.

508
00:21:09.144 --> 00:21:11.604
Yeah. especially all the single
women when they look at you.

509
00:21:11.646 --> 00:21:14.441
Talk about being
outside your comfort zone.

510
00:21:14.482 --> 00:21:17.110
I'm not really looking
to be dating right now.

511
00:21:17.152 --> 00:21:18.445
You and me both.

512
00:21:18.486 --> 00:21:22.949
*

513
00:21:22.991 --> 00:21:24.534
What?

514
00:21:24.576 --> 00:21:28.663
Why don't you come with me
to the rest of the Elfcapades?

515
00:21:28.705 --> 00:21:30.957
You can get
all the inspiration you need

516
00:21:30.999 --> 00:21:35.003
for your Warwick design
and you could be my buffer.

517
00:21:36.087 --> 00:21:38.590
Buffer? Really?

518
00:21:38.631 --> 00:21:41.134
What are you 15?
It can't be that bad.

519
00:21:41.176 --> 00:21:42.302
- Come on--
- Spencer!

520
00:21:42.344 --> 00:21:44.471
There you are.
What are you doing?

521
00:21:45.597 --> 00:21:47.057
Just doing a new batch
for Dee Dee.

522
00:21:47.098 --> 00:21:49.642
Okay. well. hurry up.

523
00:21:49.684 --> 00:21:52.812
Someone found a mistletoe
with your name on it.

524
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:54.981
Um...

525
00:21:55.023 --> 00:21:56.649
Yeah. he might be a while.

526
00:21:56.691 --> 00:21:58.485
He is a really
slow decorator.

527
00:21:59.903 --> 00:22:01.738
No rush.

528
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:02.864
We'll be waiting.

529
00:22:05.033 --> 00:22:06.785
(chuckling)

530
00:22:06.826 --> 00:22:08.828
Wow.

531
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:10.455
Okay. you weren't lying.

532
00:22:10.497 --> 00:22:11.873
Please come with me.

533
00:22:11.915 --> 00:22:13.291
(laughing)

534
00:22:13.333 --> 00:22:15.085
Okay. hear me out.

535
00:22:15.126 --> 00:22:16.795
I will go to
the Elfcapades with you

536
00:22:16.836 --> 00:22:19.506
if you will be
my personal model.

537
00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.636
Personal model?
What does that mean?

538
00:22:24.678 --> 00:22:27.097
Well. you're about the same
size as the model that

539
00:22:27.138 --> 00:22:28.723
I have to design
an outfit for

540
00:22:28.765 --> 00:22:31.101
for the Christmas Eve Fashion
Show in New York.

541
00:22:31.142 --> 00:22:33.353
and it would really help me
to have a real person

542
00:22:33.395 --> 00:22:36.272
to try on the designs.
see how they fit and look.

543
00:22:36.314 --> 00:22:39.317
So. basically you want me
to be a mannequin?

544
00:22:39.359 --> 00:22:40.527
Exactly.

545
00:22:42.028 --> 00:22:43.863
That feels degrading somehow.

546
00:22:43.905 --> 00:22:46.866
Oh. and using me as
your personal buffer isn't?

547
00:22:48.118 --> 00:22:49.411
Good point.

548
00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:53.248
So. we have a deal?

549
00:22:53.289 --> 00:22:55.000
Fine.

550
00:22:59.004 --> 00:23:00.255
My cookies look so cute.

551
00:23:00.296 --> 00:23:01.798
Not as cute as mine.
Look at this guy.

552
00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.049
Cute as a button.

553
00:23:06.803 --> 00:23:15.562
*

554
00:23:15.603 --> 00:23:17.939
Yeah. I-- I cannot believe
you're doing the rest

555
00:23:17.981 --> 00:23:21.693
of Elfcapades to help some
random mechanic you just met.

556
00:23:21.735 --> 00:23:23.903
and when I ask
it's like pulling teeth.

557
00:23:23.945 --> 00:23:26.614
Well. it's not just to help him.
I mean. he has a point.

558
00:23:26.656 --> 00:23:28.575
It might inspire
my Warwick's design.

559
00:23:28.616 --> 00:23:30.910
'cause as of now.
I have nothing.

560
00:23:30.952 --> 00:23:32.287
What's that?

561
00:23:32.328 --> 00:23:34.539
It's a snow angel silk dress.

562
00:23:36.332 --> 00:23:37.625
Word of advice?

563
00:23:38.585 --> 00:23:40.795
Nix the silk.

564
00:23:40.837 --> 00:23:44.549
Christmas attire should be
warm and cozy. not slippery.

565
00:23:44.591 --> 00:23:46.176
Well. what do you suggest?

566
00:23:46.217 --> 00:23:48.303
I don't know.
Cotton?

567
00:23:48.345 --> 00:23:50.764
Cotton?
That's so simple.

568
00:23:50.805 --> 00:23:53.892
Christmastime
should feel simple.

569
00:23:53.933 --> 00:23:57.645
Two hot coffees and some fresh
gingerbread cookies.

570
00:23:57.687 --> 00:23:59.356
- Thanks. Aunt Dee Dee.
- Thanks. Aunt Dee Dee.

571
00:23:59.397 --> 00:24:01.483
I must say. Charlie.
I haven't seen your mum

572
00:24:01.524 --> 00:24:04.152
this excited in years.

573
00:24:04.194 --> 00:24:06.780
Having you home for
Christmas is the best gift

574
00:24:06.821 --> 00:24:07.989
she ever could have
asked for.

575
00:24:08.031 --> 00:24:11.284
Yeah. well.
I have a pretty busy week.

576
00:24:11.326 --> 00:24:13.244
so I hope expectations
aren't too high.

577
00:24:14.454 --> 00:24:16.706
We'll try
to keep them at bay.

578
00:24:17.707 --> 00:24:18.875
Wow.

579
00:24:19.876 --> 00:24:20.919
What?

580
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.046
You're a real ball
of holiday cheer.

581
00:24:25.382 --> 00:24:28.176
You used to love
this time of year.

582
00:24:28.218 --> 00:24:32.013
Yeah. well. things change.

583
00:24:32.055 --> 00:24:42.023
*

584
00:24:42.065 --> 00:24:43.024
(sighing)

585
00:24:58.540 --> 00:24:59.874
(knocking)

586
00:24:59.916 --> 00:25:01.710
Lasagna's ready.

587
00:25:01.751 --> 00:25:03.962
Can you take a break?

588
00:25:04.004 --> 00:25:05.380
Come eat with us.

589
00:25:05.422 --> 00:25:08.258
I don't think so. I--

590
00:25:08.299 --> 00:25:10.427
I have a lot of
work to do still.

591
00:25:10.468 --> 00:25:11.594
Maybe tomorrow night?

592
00:25:11.636 --> 00:25:15.098
'Kay.
Well. don't work too hard.

593
00:25:17.392 --> 00:25:24.733
*

594
00:25:24.774 --> 00:25:26.943
Man on megaphone: Welcome to
the Elfcapades Night Market!

595
00:25:26.985 --> 00:25:29.571
Don't forget
your hot chocolate!

596
00:25:29.612 --> 00:25:32.907
Okay. so. I see
garlands with tinsel.

597
00:25:32.949 --> 00:25:33.825
Mm-hm.

598
00:25:33.867 --> 00:25:35.785
Twinkly lights.
Candy canes.

599
00:25:35.827 --> 00:25:37.203
Mm-hm.

600
00:25:37.245 --> 00:25:38.747
Anything jumping out
at you?

601
00:25:38.788 --> 00:25:39.831
(Christmas music playing
in background)

602
00:25:39.873 --> 00:25:41.833
Besides a sea
of people

603
00:25:41.875 --> 00:25:44.252
with very questionable
fashion sense?

604
00:25:44.294 --> 00:25:46.921
Wow.
Judgmental much?

605
00:25:46.963 --> 00:25:48.423
I'm sorry.
but in New York City

606
00:25:48.465 --> 00:25:50.342
if you wear
pajamas pants out in public.

607
00:25:50.383 --> 00:25:52.802
it is a very serious offence.

608
00:25:54.471 --> 00:25:56.222
I think it's endearing.

609
00:25:56.264 --> 00:25:57.932
Coming from a guy
who wears onesie every day.

610
00:25:57.974 --> 00:25:59.559
I wouldn't expect
anything else.

611
00:25:59.601 --> 00:26:02.270
It's not a onesie.
They are coveralls.

612
00:26:02.312 --> 00:26:04.230
Whatever.
Same thing.

613
00:26:04.272 --> 00:26:05.273
Come on.

614
00:26:06.775 --> 00:26:09.319
There is Christmas
inspiration everywhere.

615
00:26:09.361 --> 00:26:12.405
Try to use that to
your advantage

616
00:26:12.447 --> 00:26:14.908
rather than focus
on the negatives.

617
00:26:14.949 --> 00:26:15.992
Fine.

618
00:26:18.328 --> 00:26:20.455
(sighing)
Isn't this great?

619
00:26:20.497 --> 00:26:22.415
Everyone's out.
away from their screens.

620
00:26:22.457 --> 00:26:24.042
enjoying the magic
of the season.

621
00:26:25.502 --> 00:26:27.170
You really love Christmas.
don't you?

622
00:26:28.546 --> 00:26:31.424
You and my dad would
have been... best buds.

623
00:26:31.466 --> 00:26:32.926
I don't know. I just think
there's something special

624
00:26:32.967 --> 00:26:34.177
in the air this time of year.

625
00:26:36.179 --> 00:26:37.931
Oh. no.

626
00:26:37.972 --> 00:26:39.516
You're not one of
those lunatics that

627
00:26:39.557 --> 00:26:41.434
decorates in early November.
are you?

628
00:26:44.145 --> 00:26:45.939
November first.

629
00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:49.776
my wife and I. we would go nuts
and decorate the whole house.

630
00:26:49.818 --> 00:26:51.319
Our neighbors
thought we were crazy.

631
00:26:52.654 --> 00:26:53.822
You were married?

632
00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:57.867
Her name was Laura.

633
00:26:59.661 --> 00:27:01.579
She got sick
a few years back.

634
00:27:01.621 --> 00:27:02.914
Hodgkin's lymphoma.

635
00:27:06.835 --> 00:27:08.670
I'm so sorry.

636
00:27:08.712 --> 00:27:10.839
That is awful.

637
00:27:12.799 --> 00:27:14.718
That's why I decided
to move to this place.

638
00:27:16.344 --> 00:27:18.513
Leave the past
in the past.

639
00:27:18.555 --> 00:27:22.809
*

640
00:27:22.851 --> 00:27:26.896
Don't you find it hard to
celebrate Christmas without her?

641
00:27:28.064 --> 00:27:28.982
Yeah.

642
00:27:30.316 --> 00:27:32.944
But I don't think
she would want me to avoid it

643
00:27:32.986 --> 00:27:35.405
just because she's not here.

644
00:27:37.407 --> 00:27:39.034
I don't know.

645
00:27:39.075 --> 00:27:42.495
Oh. man. She would have
loved the Elfcapades.

646
00:27:46.583 --> 00:27:48.626
Son of a... snowman!
Go. go. go!

647
00:27:48.668 --> 00:27:49.878
What are you doing?

648
00:27:49.919 --> 00:27:51.838
Oh. my gosh.
That's my ex over there.

649
00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:55.216
Being in this town is
like living in a snow globe.

650
00:27:55.258 --> 00:27:56.551
Where is he?

651
00:27:56.593 --> 00:27:58.011
Green coat. red hat.

652
00:28:00.221 --> 00:28:01.556
Evan Miller?

653
00:28:01.598 --> 00:28:02.599
(shushing)

654
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.933
Is-- Isn't he the mayor?

655
00:28:03.975 --> 00:28:05.894
Brooksbend's youngest
mayor ever elected.

656
00:28:07.103 --> 00:28:08.563
What is he doing?
Who is he with?

657
00:28:08.605 --> 00:28:10.774
Are they holding hands?

658
00:28:10.815 --> 00:28:13.485
Did you guys. like.
just break up or something?

659
00:28:13.526 --> 00:28:14.903
Four years ago.

660
00:28:16.529 --> 00:28:18.031
You okay?

661
00:28:18.073 --> 00:28:20.909
Yeah. no. I'm fine.
Everything's fine.

662
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:23.703
It's not like
we were engaged or anything.

663
00:28:23.745 --> 00:28:26.998
Engaged? Really?

664
00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:29.376
Broke up with me
two months after my dad...

665
00:28:31.461 --> 00:28:33.630
He said he was...

666
00:28:33.672 --> 00:28:36.049
He said he needed space
and he was sick

667
00:28:36.091 --> 00:28:38.176
of taking the train to New York
every other weekend.

668
00:28:40.178 --> 00:28:42.097
He abandoned me
when I needed him most.

669
00:28:42.138 --> 00:28:43.932
Sounds like you
dodged a bullet.

670
00:28:46.059 --> 00:28:48.061
Hey. let's get out of here.

671
00:28:48.103 --> 00:28:49.479
To where?

672
00:28:49.521 --> 00:28:51.731
Christmas village where
we have to dress up like elves

673
00:28:51.773 --> 00:28:53.024
and prance around?

674
00:28:53.066 --> 00:28:56.319
I know a spot.
Come on. Go. Go. go.

675
00:28:57.696 --> 00:29:02.325
(band playing)

676
00:29:02.367 --> 00:29:04.285
(laughing)
What?

677
00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:09.874
Oh!

678
00:29:09.916 --> 00:29:11.960
Why am I so bad at this?

679
00:29:12.002 --> 00:29:14.170
It's okay. you just...

680
00:29:14.212 --> 00:29:16.006
you just gotta focus.
all right?

681
00:29:18.008 --> 00:29:21.344
Really focus. and don't let
the outside world distract you.

682
00:29:21.386 --> 00:29:24.139
Well. it's hard to not let all
this flannel obscure my vision.

683
00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:27.475
Hey. watch it. Flannel is
the greatest fabric on earth.

684
00:29:27.517 --> 00:29:28.518
(groaning)

685
00:29:30.854 --> 00:29:32.897
- (groaning)
- Wow.

686
00:29:32.939 --> 00:29:33.940
Yeah. you're terrible.

687
00:29:33.982 --> 00:29:36.943
Hey!
(chuckling)

688
00:29:36.985 --> 00:29:38.361
Thank you
for bringing me here.

689
00:29:38.403 --> 00:29:42.323
The Christmas Market has
a lot of memories attached.

690
00:29:42.365 --> 00:29:45.827
Sometimes it's hard for me
to be home this time of year.

691
00:29:45.869 --> 00:29:47.620
You said it yourself.
you know?

692
00:29:47.662 --> 00:29:49.539
Sometimes it's best to
leave the past in the past.

693
00:29:54.294 --> 00:29:55.587
(scoffing)

694
00:29:55.628 --> 00:29:57.881
How are you
so good at this?

695
00:29:57.922 --> 00:29:59.424
All right. just...

696
00:29:59.466 --> 00:30:01.092
picture Evan's face.

697
00:30:01.134 --> 00:30:03.219
- Come on.
- Trust me. it works.

698
00:30:07.849 --> 00:30:09.017
Spencer:
Oh!

699
00:30:09.059 --> 00:30:11.603
- (laughing)
- See? I told you it works!

700
00:30:11.644 --> 00:30:14.856
Wow! I actually pictured
your face. hope that's okay.

701
00:30:14.898 --> 00:30:17.150
- Whatever gets you through.
- (laughing)

702
00:30:19.027 --> 00:30:20.904
I'm really sorry
about your wife. Spencer.

703
00:30:22.113 --> 00:30:23.365
I'm sorry about your dad.

704
00:30:24.324 --> 00:30:26.076
Woman: Hi. Spencer.
(giggling)

705
00:30:30.997 --> 00:30:33.667
Wow. you really are
the Clooney of Brooksbend.

706
00:30:33.708 --> 00:30:36.211
(laughing)

707
00:30:36.252 --> 00:30:38.463
Don't get weird about
what I'm about to do.

708
00:30:38.505 --> 00:30:39.923
What are you doing?

709
00:30:39.964 --> 00:30:42.425
Getting them to
mind their own business.

710
00:30:42.467 --> 00:30:43.551
Just look me in the eyes.

711
00:30:45.595 --> 00:30:52.769
*

712
00:30:52.811 --> 00:30:56.272
Um. there you go.
(laughing)

713
00:30:56.314 --> 00:30:57.440
Yes. uh...

714
00:30:57.482 --> 00:30:58.733
I should get home.

715
00:30:58.775 --> 00:31:00.443
I have some sketches to do.

716
00:31:00.485 --> 00:31:01.820
Of course. right.

717
00:31:01.861 --> 00:31:02.904
- Um. yeah.
- I got this. I got this.

718
00:31:02.946 --> 00:31:03.947
Oh. thank you so much.

719
00:31:03.988 --> 00:31:05.281
Here. let me help you
with this.

720
00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:20.839
Ben:
Wake up. Aunt Charlie!

721
00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.091
(groaning)
What the--

722
00:31:23.133 --> 00:31:24.300
Breakfast is ready!

723
00:31:24.342 --> 00:31:25.802
Okay.

724
00:31:25.844 --> 00:31:27.512
You know. I think I'm going to
skip breakfast today. Ben.

725
00:31:27.554 --> 00:31:29.180
Okay? I'll just make
a smoothie later.

726
00:31:29.222 --> 00:31:32.308
Well. Mom said that
if you said that.

727
00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:34.185
I was allowed
to jump on you.

728
00:31:34.227 --> 00:31:37.147
She said that?
Ugh!

729
00:31:37.188 --> 00:31:40.483
Oh. Not the phone. man.
Come on.

730
00:31:40.525 --> 00:31:43.486
Will you come
down for breakfast?

731
00:31:43.528 --> 00:31:44.988
Are you blackmailing me?

732
00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:46.823
I don't know
what that means.

733
00:31:46.865 --> 00:31:49.617
(sighing)
I will be down in a sec.

734
00:31:49.659 --> 00:31:51.828
Just give me a few
minutes to get ready. okay?

735
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:53.246
Yay!

736
00:31:53.288 --> 00:31:54.873
Okay.
Eggs are ready.

737
00:31:54.914 --> 00:31:56.374
(talking over each other)

738
00:31:56.416 --> 00:32:00.462
Oh. look who it is.
How nice of you to join us.

739
00:32:00.503 --> 00:32:03.590
Yes. and thank you for
sending up the human torpedo.

740
00:32:03.631 --> 00:32:05.842
That is me!

741
00:32:05.884 --> 00:32:07.677
Let me pour you a coffee.

742
00:32:07.719 --> 00:32:09.054
No thanks.
I got it.

743
00:32:11.806 --> 00:32:14.017
So. we were hoping you might
be able to join us tonight

744
00:32:14.059 --> 00:32:15.435
for a Christmas-themed
games night.

745
00:32:15.477 --> 00:32:18.021
Oh. I would.
but I promised Spencer

746
00:32:18.063 --> 00:32:19.856
that I would go to
the Elfcapades with him.

747
00:32:19.898 --> 00:32:21.858
That is tonight's Elfcapades.

748
00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:23.443
What do you mean?

749
00:32:23.485 --> 00:32:26.863
Everyone's encouraged to play
a Christmas-themed games night

750
00:32:26.905 --> 00:32:27.864
with their family.

751
00:32:27.906 --> 00:32:29.783
So. you'll join us?

752
00:32:29.824 --> 00:32:32.369
Please. Aunt Charlie?

753
00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:35.955
Okay. sure. but I still
have a ton of work to do. so--

754
00:32:35.997 --> 00:32:38.208
However long we can have you.
we'll have you.

755
00:32:40.752 --> 00:32:41.836
Rick:
Was it something I said?

756
00:32:41.878 --> 00:32:43.088
Christina:
She just really misses dad.

757
00:32:43.129 --> 00:32:46.049
Okay. what do you
think about this?

758
00:32:46.091 --> 00:32:48.635
So. picture this silver
being extra shiny

759
00:32:48.677 --> 00:32:50.136
with tinsel-fringed sleeves.

760
00:32:55.809 --> 00:32:58.103
It kind of looks
like a disco ball.

761
00:32:58.978 --> 00:33:00.021
Okay.

762
00:33:00.063 --> 00:33:02.315
So. retro.
Retro is in.

763
00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:06.861
Dee. would you
come here a sec?

764
00:33:07.904 --> 00:33:10.073
So.

765
00:33:10.115 --> 00:33:12.242
Would you wear this?
With the tinsel?

766
00:33:13.243 --> 00:33:16.246
Honestly?
Probably not.

767
00:33:16.287 --> 00:33:19.541
Too flashy
for little old me.

768
00:33:19.582 --> 00:33:22.127
Well. what do you like to
wear during the holidays?

769
00:33:22.168 --> 00:33:25.255
Something simple
but comfortable.

770
00:33:25.296 --> 00:33:28.299
Modern. but also
traditional and classic.

771
00:33:28.341 --> 00:33:29.509
you know what I mean?

772
00:33:30.719 --> 00:33:32.137
I'm trying.

773
00:33:34.139 --> 00:33:36.558
This is useless.

774
00:33:36.599 --> 00:33:39.185
Modern. but also
traditional and classic?

775
00:33:39.227 --> 00:33:40.520
What does that even mean?

776
00:33:41.771 --> 00:33:43.148
(groaning)
I'm doomed.

777
00:33:43.189 --> 00:33:45.442
I think
I know what she means.

778
00:33:45.483 --> 00:33:47.402
You do?

779
00:33:47.444 --> 00:33:49.112
Mm-hm.

780
00:33:49.154 --> 00:33:51.322
Come with me.
I gotta show you something.

781
00:33:56.077 --> 00:34:03.126
*

782
00:34:03.168 --> 00:34:04.961
This is what she means.

783
00:34:05.003 --> 00:34:05.920
Come again?

784
00:34:07.297 --> 00:34:09.132
So. for the last two years.

785
00:34:09.174 --> 00:34:12.052
I've been restoring
this old car.

786
00:34:12.093 --> 00:34:15.555
finding parts. cleaning them.
adding my own unique touches.

787
00:34:15.597 --> 00:34:17.974
but making sure that
I protect all the things

788
00:34:18.016 --> 00:34:19.684
that make this car
so special.

789
00:34:19.726 --> 00:34:20.769
(chuckling)

790
00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:22.937
All right. come. Sit.

791
00:34:22.979 --> 00:34:32.947
*

792
00:34:36.618 --> 00:34:39.537
Wow.
This is really beautiful.

793
00:34:39.579 --> 00:34:40.372
- Right?
- Mm-hm.

794
00:34:40.413 --> 00:34:42.791
Here. feel the leather.

795
00:34:42.832 --> 00:34:44.167
Mm-hm.

796
00:34:44.209 --> 00:34:45.669
No. come on.
Really feel it.

797
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:47.712
Close your eyes.

798
00:34:47.754 --> 00:34:49.005
Seriously?

799
00:34:49.047 --> 00:34:49.964
Humor me.

800
00:34:54.344 --> 00:34:56.513
Feel that?
All that history?

801
00:34:56.554 --> 00:34:57.889
Hm.

802
00:34:57.931 --> 00:35:00.350
This car was made for
the average American family.

803
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:05.814
It's comfortable.
affordable.

804
00:35:05.855 --> 00:35:08.316
No frills. just classic.

805
00:35:08.358 --> 00:35:11.236
It's nostalgic.
but still contemporary.

806
00:35:14.823 --> 00:35:16.616
I think your design
could do the same.

807
00:35:19.577 --> 00:35:21.204
Too cheesy?

808
00:35:21.246 --> 00:35:24.374
No.
Not at all.

809
00:35:25.542 --> 00:35:27.377
You just made me
realize how much I miss that

810
00:35:27.419 --> 00:35:30.880
creative enthusiasm and passion
that you have for cars.

811
00:35:32.382 --> 00:35:35.218
I used to get
so excited

812
00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:37.762
to just sit
and sketch and sew.

813
00:35:37.804 --> 00:35:41.474
You know. before profits
or reviews mattered.

814
00:35:43.685 --> 00:35:47.480
I guess I just lost that
joy somewhere along the way.

815
00:35:51.609 --> 00:35:53.403
Well. this is a great
chance to get it back.

816
00:35:55.447 --> 00:35:57.782
What was your favorite
Christmas tradition growing up?

817
00:35:58.825 --> 00:35:59.993
I don't know.

818
00:36:00.035 --> 00:36:03.413
Probably throwing snowballs
at my sister.

819
00:36:03.455 --> 00:36:06.750
(laughing)
Come on. no. Seriously.

820
00:36:06.791 --> 00:36:09.753
What part of the holidays was
always the most magical to you?

821
00:36:12.881 --> 00:36:14.549
Probably the Pajamboree.

822
00:36:16.134 --> 00:36:17.093
Pajamboree?

823
00:36:17.135 --> 00:36:18.553
Yeah.

824
00:36:18.595 --> 00:36:21.389
It's the last event
of Elfcapades on Christmas Eve.

825
00:36:21.431 --> 00:36:26.227
People wear their pajamas
and there's music and dessert.

826
00:36:26.269 --> 00:36:28.772
And my dad would
always make homemade pizza

827
00:36:28.813 --> 00:36:32.734
before we'd all pile
into his tow truck and went.

828
00:36:32.776 --> 00:36:34.694
Your dad was
a tow truck driver?

829
00:36:36.446 --> 00:36:38.281
You weren't the only guy roaming
around town in coveralls.

830
00:36:38.323 --> 00:36:41.409
(both laughing)

831
00:36:41.451 --> 00:36:45.830
Anyway. that's what I looked
forward to the most.

832
00:36:48.124 --> 00:36:49.959
Pajamboree.

833
00:36:50.001 --> 00:36:51.086
- Hm.
- I love it.

834
00:36:54.214 --> 00:36:55.340
Wait.

835
00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.803
Why don't you design a pair
of pajamas for Warwick's?

836
00:36:59.844 --> 00:37:01.930
- Pajamas?
- Yeah!

837
00:37:01.971 --> 00:37:04.974
Everyone loves a new
pair of PJs at Christmas time.

838
00:37:08.478 --> 00:37:09.854
That's not
a bad idea. actually.

839
00:37:11.564 --> 00:37:12.941
In fact.
that's a great idea.

840
00:37:12.982 --> 00:37:14.317
Yeah?

841
00:37:14.359 --> 00:37:15.318
Definitely!

842
00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:17.946
It's genius!

843
00:37:17.987 --> 00:37:20.281
I'll design a matching pair
of holiday pajamas

844
00:37:20.323 --> 00:37:21.991
for him and her.

845
00:37:23.827 --> 00:37:25.995
It's perfect.

846
00:37:26.037 --> 00:37:27.163
Thank you. Spencer!

847
00:37:27.205 --> 00:37:28.581
Aw. happy to help.

848
00:37:30.417 --> 00:37:31.835
Hey. what are you
doing later?

849
00:37:31.876 --> 00:37:34.504
Why don't you come over
to our place for game night?

850
00:37:34.546 --> 00:37:36.840
Um. I wouldn't want to impose.
Don't worry--

851
00:37:36.881 --> 00:37:38.466
No. it's not an imposition.
Seriously.

852
00:37:38.508 --> 00:37:40.552
Dee Dee will
be there. too.

853
00:37:41.636 --> 00:37:43.680
You sure your family
won't mind?

854
00:37:43.722 --> 00:37:45.515
I am positive.

855
00:37:45.557 --> 00:37:48.476
Like they say.
the more the merrier.

856
00:37:48.518 --> 00:37:50.854
Maybe we could even get in
a game of Christmas Pictionary.

857
00:37:50.895 --> 00:37:53.064
Mm-hm. Yeah. I mean.
if you're okay with losing.

858
00:37:53.106 --> 00:37:54.983
we can definitely
arrange that.

859
00:37:55.025 --> 00:37:57.902
(laughing)
I'm willing to take the risk.

860
00:37:59.195 --> 00:38:00.739
(car approaching.
horn honking)

861
00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.908
Oh. well.
I better go help him.

862
00:38:10.331 --> 00:38:11.666
So. Mrs. Mousey said.

863
00:38:11.708 --> 00:38:13.460
"Thank you for the ride.
Santa.

864
00:38:13.501 --> 00:38:15.128
I'll make sure to
leave some gouda and milk

865
00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:16.838
under the tree for you."

866
00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.465
And that's how
the magical Christmas mouse

867
00:38:18.506 --> 00:38:20.050
found his way home.

868
00:38:20.091 --> 00:38:21.426
The end.

869
00:38:21.468 --> 00:38:22.802
Again! Again!

870
00:38:22.844 --> 00:38:25.013
Why don't you read it
this time?

871
00:38:25.055 --> 00:38:27.891
No. you're better at the voices.
Auntie Charlie.

872
00:38:27.932 --> 00:38:30.935
Hey. nobody does
Mrs. Mousey like your mom.

873
00:38:30.977 --> 00:38:33.355
Hey. The truth hurts. sis.
Deal with it.

874
00:38:33.396 --> 00:38:34.397
(laughing)

875
00:38:34.439 --> 00:38:35.440
(doorbell ringing)

876
00:38:35.482 --> 00:38:37.233
Mom:
Oh. I'll get it.

877
00:38:39.819 --> 00:38:40.945
Hi!

878
00:38:40.987 --> 00:38:43.073
Welcome. you two.
Let me take your coats.

879
00:38:43.114 --> 00:38:44.741
- Spencer: Thank you so much.
- Dee Dee: Thanks.

880
00:38:46.493 --> 00:38:48.787
Mom:
Make yourself comfortable.

881
00:38:48.828 --> 00:38:49.829
Thank you.

882
00:38:51.456 --> 00:38:52.791
Welcome.

883
00:38:52.832 --> 00:38:56.544
Thank you.
This house is incredible.

884
00:38:56.586 --> 00:38:58.296
Did you grow up here?

885
00:38:58.338 --> 00:38:59.589
Born and raised.

886
00:38:59.631 --> 00:39:01.800
Well. I was born
in a hospital.

887
00:39:01.841 --> 00:39:02.717
Right.

888
00:39:02.759 --> 00:39:03.760
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah.

889
00:39:03.802 --> 00:39:06.471
Wow.
If these walls could talk.

890
00:39:06.513 --> 00:39:07.806
No kidding.

891
00:39:07.847 --> 00:39:10.558
I actually had
my first kiss right over there.

892
00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:11.976
- No way!
- Mm-hm.

893
00:39:12.018 --> 00:39:13.645
Was it everything you hoped
and dreamed it would be?

894
00:39:13.687 --> 00:39:15.772
No. it was
terrible actually.

895
00:39:15.814 --> 00:39:17.941
(laughing)

896
00:39:17.982 --> 00:39:19.150
Wow!

897
00:39:20.902 --> 00:39:22.362
Adorable.

898
00:39:22.404 --> 00:39:24.322
Yeah.

899
00:39:24.364 --> 00:39:25.907
Pajamboree?

900
00:39:25.949 --> 00:39:27.075
You bet.

901
00:39:27.117 --> 00:39:28.702
Mm. look at you.

902
00:39:28.743 --> 00:39:31.037
Flannel jammies.
The horror!

903
00:39:31.079 --> 00:39:32.205
Yeah. I have to admit.

904
00:39:32.247 --> 00:39:33.665
those were actually
pretty comfortable.

905
00:39:33.707 --> 00:39:34.541
See?

906
00:39:34.582 --> 00:39:35.917
(chuckling)

907
00:39:35.959 --> 00:39:39.754
All right. everyone.
Let's get started.

908
00:39:39.796 --> 00:39:41.047
Christmas Pictionary?

909
00:39:41.089 --> 00:39:42.173
Your wish was my command.

910
00:39:42.215 --> 00:39:44.050
Okay!

911
00:39:44.092 --> 00:39:46.720
*

912
00:39:46.761 --> 00:39:50.056
(shouting over each other)

913
00:39:50.098 --> 00:39:51.307
(cheering)

914
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:52.517
* Bells are ringing *

915
00:39:52.559 --> 00:39:54.811
* There's a magic
in the air *

916
00:39:54.853 --> 00:39:57.397
* Choirs are singing *

917
00:39:57.439 --> 00:40:00.483
* Full of
joy and happiness *

918
00:40:00.525 --> 00:40:02.944
* Stars are bright *

919
00:40:02.986 --> 00:40:04.696
* As we share
a winter's night *

920
00:40:04.738 --> 00:40:06.614
* Here's to Christmas *

921
00:40:06.656 --> 00:40:09.034
(talking over each other)

922
00:40:09.075 --> 00:40:09.993
* Kids are smiling *

923
00:40:10.035 --> 00:40:12.871
* Making snowmen
in the street *

924
00:40:12.912 --> 00:40:14.581
* People driving
to be home... *

925
00:40:14.622 --> 00:40:17.417
Oh. safe drive. Spencer.
It was so lovely to have you.

926
00:40:17.459 --> 00:40:19.044
Thank you for having me.

927
00:40:19.085 --> 00:40:20.503
We'll get 'em next year.

928
00:40:20.545 --> 00:40:21.546
Unlikely.

929
00:40:21.588 --> 00:40:23.631
* Here's to Christmas... *

930
00:40:23.673 --> 00:40:25.633
Thanks for inviting me.

931
00:40:25.675 --> 00:40:27.135
Your family's awesome.

932
00:40:27.177 --> 00:40:29.763
Yeah. well. thank you
for the game suggestion.

933
00:40:29.804 --> 00:40:31.890
I had a lot more fun
than I thought I would.

934
00:40:31.931 --> 00:40:34.392
Now. all I want
to do is draw.

935
00:40:34.434 --> 00:40:35.602
That was the hope.

936
00:40:36.895 --> 00:40:39.105
Is that why
you chose Pictionary?

937
00:40:39.147 --> 00:40:40.732
I thought it might help
get you out of your head

938
00:40:40.774 --> 00:40:43.568
and reconnect with
drawing just for fun.

939
00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:46.071
Thank you.
It did help.

940
00:40:46.112 --> 00:40:47.280
Good.

941
00:40:47.322 --> 00:40:49.574
I expect three designs
by 9:00am tomorrow.

942
00:40:49.616 --> 00:40:51.326
Yes. sir. On it.

943
00:40:53.244 --> 00:40:56.915
Okay. Well... goodnight.

944
00:40:56.956 --> 00:40:58.625
You. too.

945
00:41:01.586 --> 00:41:04.255
(door opening. closing)

946
00:41:08.176 --> 00:41:09.427
(knocking)

947
00:41:09.469 --> 00:41:11.346
Christina:
Char?

948
00:41:11.388 --> 00:41:13.431
Charlie.

949
00:41:13.473 --> 00:41:15.475
(chuckling)
Are you awake?

950
00:41:15.517 --> 00:41:16.976
What time is it?

951
00:41:17.018 --> 00:41:19.270
It's almost 10:00.
When did you go to bed?

952
00:41:19.312 --> 00:41:21.439
I don't know. I--

953
00:41:21.481 --> 00:41:23.108
I just kept sketching.

954
00:41:23.149 --> 00:41:25.193
I had so many ideas
bouncing around in my head.

955
00:41:25.235 --> 00:41:28.446
Hm. Looks like you may
have found your muse.

956
00:41:28.488 --> 00:41:30.990
- What do you mean?
- What? Nothing.

957
00:41:31.032 --> 00:41:33.618
Hey. do you know where
my old sewing machine is?

958
00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:35.537
Should be in the closet.

959
00:41:35.578 --> 00:41:37.914
- Huh.
- Okay.

960
00:41:37.956 --> 00:41:40.458
Coffee's going to
run out if you're not quick.

961
00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:42.002
I'll be down soon.

962
00:41:48.049 --> 00:41:58.018
*

963
00:42:10.697 --> 00:42:12.157
Spencer:
Thank you. Yeah. that's good.

964
00:42:12.198 --> 00:42:18.288
*

965
00:42:18.329 --> 00:42:19.372
I've done it.

966
00:42:19.414 --> 00:42:22.292
I have sketched
five new designs.

967
00:42:22.334 --> 00:42:24.169
Five?! That's amazing.

968
00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:26.629
Yeah. Now. we just need to
figure out which ones are best.

969
00:42:26.671 --> 00:42:28.173
How do we decide?

970
00:42:28.214 --> 00:42:31.009
I have to make them first.
obviously.

971
00:42:31.051 --> 00:42:32.844
and then.
as my personal mannequin.

972
00:42:32.886 --> 00:42:34.429
I will need your help.

973
00:42:34.471 --> 00:42:35.847
What do you have
in mind?

974
00:42:41.978 --> 00:42:43.938
Oh. wow.
what about this?

975
00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:45.148
Like a Grinch moment.
you know?

976
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:47.525
No.
No. that's not gonna work.

977
00:42:47.567 --> 00:42:50.236
Okay. um-- Oh!

978
00:42:50.278 --> 00:42:52.197
Oh. look at this.

979
00:42:52.238 --> 00:42:53.198
Oh. that's cozy.

980
00:42:53.239 --> 00:42:55.075
Oh. it's so soft.

981
00:42:55.116 --> 00:42:56.701
- Yeah. What do you think?
- I think it's perfect.

982
00:42:56.743 --> 00:42:57.911
- I'm in.
- Let's do it.

983
00:42:57.952 --> 00:42:59.245
- Winner.
- All right.

984
00:42:59.287 --> 00:43:02.707
*

985
00:43:02.749 --> 00:43:05.502
* Ring the bells.
blow the horn *

986
00:43:05.543 --> 00:43:08.713
* Let the music play *

987
00:43:08.755 --> 00:43:09.714
* School is out *

988
00:43:09.756 --> 00:43:11.633
Well. that's great.
and then...

989
00:43:11.675 --> 00:43:13.510
- No?
- No.

990
00:43:13.551 --> 00:43:14.552
- No?
- It's nothing.

991
00:43:14.594 --> 00:43:15.970
All right. X it out.

992
00:43:18.682 --> 00:43:21.017
* Celebrate with
family and friends *

993
00:43:21.059 --> 00:43:23.728
* Christmas is here again *

994
00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:25.939
* Listening to
the Christmas... *

995
00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:27.399
What are you doing in there?
Come out.

996
00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:28.525
(knocking)

997
00:43:28.566 --> 00:43:31.695
Spencer:
I'm on my way.

998
00:43:31.736 --> 00:43:33.405
Okay. so?

999
00:43:33.446 --> 00:43:34.531
How does it feel?

1000
00:43:34.572 --> 00:43:37.867
Feels good. Comfy.
How does it look?

1001
00:43:37.909 --> 00:43:39.327
It's a little bit
loose in here

1002
00:43:39.369 --> 00:43:42.914
and it can be taken in
a little at the waist.

1003
00:43:42.956 --> 00:43:47.085
the length isn't quite right.
and the collar needs some work.

1004
00:43:47.127 --> 00:43:48.753
I'm not so sure
about the fabric either.

1005
00:43:48.795 --> 00:43:51.047
but for a first attempt
it's not bad.

1006
00:43:51.089 --> 00:43:53.049
Just okay?

1007
00:43:53.091 --> 00:43:54.592
Yeah. something isn't
quite right.

1008
00:43:54.634 --> 00:43:57.095
but. no.
we're getting there.

1009
00:43:57.137 --> 00:43:58.930
All right. but you're
not discouraged. right?

1010
00:43:58.972 --> 00:44:02.100
No.
Actually. I'm quite inspired.

1011
00:44:02.142 --> 00:44:03.309
Great.

1012
00:44:03.351 --> 00:44:05.937
Told you the Elfcapades would
inspire you.

1013
00:44:05.979 --> 00:44:10.483
Yeah. Not so sure
it's just the Elfcapades.

1014
00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:16.406
(phone ringing)

1015
00:44:16.448 --> 00:44:17.532
(grunting)

1016
00:44:20.035 --> 00:44:20.994
Hello?

1017
00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.621
Uh. yes.

1018
00:44:23.663 --> 00:44:25.832
Okay. yeah.
I'll be right there.

1019
00:44:28.543 --> 00:44:29.586
Duty calls.

1020
00:44:31.338 --> 00:44:32.922
Well. I'll see you
at bingo tonight?

1021
00:44:32.964 --> 00:44:34.132
I wouldn't miss it.

1022
00:44:34.174 --> 00:44:35.175
Great.

1023
00:44:36.092 --> 00:44:37.469
I should probably
change. right?

1024
00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:38.470
- Yeah.
- Yeah. okay.

1025
00:44:38.511 --> 00:44:39.554
Thank you.

1026
00:44:47.103 --> 00:44:50.148
Okay. do you want
a smoky eye or natural?

1027
00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:52.942
Natural. I don't want it to
seem like I'm trying too hard.

1028
00:44:52.984 --> 00:44:55.737
(chuckling)
Okay.

1029
00:44:55.779 --> 00:44:57.238
What?

1030
00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:00.200
Nothing.

1031
00:45:00.241 --> 00:45:01.785
I just--
I don't remember the last time

1032
00:45:01.826 --> 00:45:03.703
you asked me
to do your make-up.

1033
00:45:03.745 --> 00:45:05.705
So?

1034
00:45:05.747 --> 00:45:07.415
So. you like him.

1035
00:45:07.457 --> 00:45:10.627
Like who? Spencer?

1036
00:45:10.669 --> 00:45:11.753
Is that such a bad thing?

1037
00:45:11.795 --> 00:45:14.047
Christina. I live in New York.

1038
00:45:14.089 --> 00:45:15.715
Okay. relationships are
hard enough

1039
00:45:15.757 --> 00:45:18.426
without the long distance
involved.

1040
00:45:18.468 --> 00:45:19.886
Whatever you say.

1041
00:45:19.928 --> 00:45:22.722
I just-- I don't want you to
miss out on something good

1042
00:45:22.764 --> 00:45:26.643
because you're so
focused on your job.

1043
00:45:26.685 --> 00:45:30.647
But Alistair isn't job.

1044
00:45:30.689 --> 00:45:31.690
It's my life.

1045
00:45:34.818 --> 00:45:36.069
I just miss my sister.

1046
00:45:37.737 --> 00:45:41.032
It's been four years since
you've come home for Christmas.

1047
00:45:42.826 --> 00:45:44.035
I know.

1048
00:45:50.083 --> 00:45:52.002
Hey. do you remember
when we used to have

1049
00:45:52.043 --> 00:45:53.586
sleepovers in my room?

1050
00:45:53.628 --> 00:45:56.256
We'd do each other's
make-up

1051
00:45:56.297 --> 00:45:59.884
and we'd stay up all night
and talk about our crushes.

1052
00:45:59.926 --> 00:46:02.095
(chuckling)
Of course.

1053
00:46:02.137 --> 00:46:04.389
We should do that again.

1054
00:46:04.431 --> 00:46:05.432
Before I go.

1055
00:46:07.058 --> 00:46:08.977
I'd love that.

1056
00:46:09.019 --> 00:46:10.311
Okay. Good.

1057
00:46:11.604 --> 00:46:12.897
Good.

1058
00:46:12.939 --> 00:46:14.065
(chuckling)

1059
00:46:14.107 --> 00:46:15.692
- How do I look?
- Perfect.

1060
00:46:15.734 --> 00:46:21.573
*

1061
00:46:21.614 --> 00:46:25.118
Next up I have Prancer!

1062
00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:27.954
Ah. yes!
Got that one. Sweet!

1063
00:46:27.996 --> 00:46:29.080
Spencer: Wow.

1064
00:46:29.122 --> 00:46:32.167
You really want
that giant elf bear.

1065
00:46:32.208 --> 00:46:34.377
What?
Ben would love it.

1066
00:46:34.419 --> 00:46:37.130
Oh. sure. Ben.

1067
00:46:39.215 --> 00:46:43.636
Okay. next we have
Frosty the Snowman.

1068
00:46:43.678 --> 00:46:45.221
Oh. I have
that one. too! Okay.

1069
00:46:45.263 --> 00:46:47.223
I just need mistletoe
and then I win.

1070
00:46:47.265 --> 00:46:49.225
These people
are all going down.

1071
00:46:49.267 --> 00:46:51.144
I love Christmas bingo.

1072
00:46:51.186 --> 00:46:53.438
I think you just
like winning.

1073
00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:58.276
Uh-oh. are you jealous of
my superior bingo success?

1074
00:46:58.318 --> 00:47:02.280
Hardly. Look. the--
the giant stuffy's all yours.

1075
00:47:02.322 --> 00:47:04.657
To be honest.
elves creep me out.

1076
00:47:04.699 --> 00:47:06.034
- What?
- Yeah.

1077
00:47:06.076 --> 00:47:09.829
Mr. Christmas is
creeped out by elves.

1078
00:47:09.871 --> 00:47:11.414
What a twist.

1079
00:47:11.456 --> 00:47:13.667
Oh. don't even get me started
on elf on a shelf. Chilling.

1080
00:47:13.708 --> 00:47:15.669
- What?
- Yeah.

1081
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:17.587
I'll be right back.
I'm just gonna use the restroom.

1082
00:47:17.629 --> 00:47:18.505
You're going to miss me win!

1083
00:47:18.546 --> 00:47:19.547
I'll be quick.

1084
00:47:24.511 --> 00:47:25.762
Hey. Charlotte.

1085
00:47:25.804 --> 00:47:26.846
Oh! Hey. Gwen.

1086
00:47:26.888 --> 00:47:28.515
I see you're here
with Spencer.

1087
00:47:28.556 --> 00:47:29.474
Yeah.

1088
00:47:29.516 --> 00:47:31.976
Are you guys here...
together?

1089
00:47:32.018 --> 00:47:34.187
Oh. um. I don't...

1090
00:47:35.939 --> 00:47:39.025
You are just
too cute. Mayor.

1091
00:47:39.067 --> 00:47:41.611
I am going to go
get us another round.

1092
00:47:41.653 --> 00:47:42.987
Sounds good.

1093
00:47:43.029 --> 00:47:44.989
- Hello? Earth to Charlotte!
- Uh. What?

1094
00:47:45.031 --> 00:47:46.491
(rattling)

1095
00:47:46.533 --> 00:47:50.412
All right.
next we have mistletoe!

1096
00:47:52.747 --> 00:47:53.790
- Bingo!
- Bingo!

1097
00:47:53.832 --> 00:47:55.667
You got bingo. You gotta go up.

1098
00:47:55.709 --> 00:47:56.751
Go. go. Hurry!

1099
00:47:58.253 --> 00:48:01.715
Well. come on up. you two.
Let me check your sheets.

1100
00:48:01.756 --> 00:48:02.757
Hey. Charlotte.

1101
00:48:02.799 --> 00:48:03.800
Hi.

1102
00:48:05.385 --> 00:48:06.803
Dee Dee: Interesting to
see you here. Evan.

1103
00:48:06.845 --> 00:48:08.179
And why is that?

1104
00:48:08.221 --> 00:48:11.224
Considering you're the one
who took away funding.

1105
00:48:11.266 --> 00:48:13.226
I didn't expect
you to participate.

1106
00:48:13.268 --> 00:48:15.186
Wait. you were
the one who stopped

1107
00:48:15.228 --> 00:48:17.105
the funding for Elfcapades?

1108
00:48:17.147 --> 00:48:18.815
Well. there's more
important things that need

1109
00:48:18.857 --> 00:48:20.650
budgetary attention
in this town.

1110
00:48:20.692 --> 00:48:24.029
But you knew how important
this event is to my family.

1111
00:48:24.070 --> 00:48:27.615
and to my dad. and to me.

1112
00:48:27.657 --> 00:48:31.911
I know. I'm sorry. It just isn't
a priority for me right now.

1113
00:48:31.953 --> 00:48:33.788
Well. folks.
it looks like there's a tie.

1114
00:48:33.830 --> 00:48:36.166
but there's only one prize.

1115
00:48:36.207 --> 00:48:39.419
Oh. it's fine. He can have it.

1116
00:48:39.461 --> 00:48:40.879
Are you sure?

1117
00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:43.089
I mean. that would be great.
Jillian really wanted it.

1118
00:48:43.131 --> 00:48:44.174
Who's Jillian?

1119
00:48:44.215 --> 00:48:46.176
Oh. my beautiful
new fiancee.

1120
00:48:47.635 --> 00:48:52.557
The only way to deal with
this unprecedented moment

1121
00:48:52.599 --> 00:48:56.269
is the ultimate
mistletoe tie-breaker.

1122
00:48:56.311 --> 00:48:58.605
Um. what is that?

1123
00:48:58.646 --> 00:49:00.190
The first person to
find someone to kiss them

1124
00:49:00.231 --> 00:49:02.192
under the mistletoe wins.

1125
00:49:07.405 --> 00:49:09.574
Jillian! Jill!
Come here. hurry!

1126
00:49:09.616 --> 00:49:11.951
Yeah. quick.
Jillyboo. please!

1127
00:49:11.993 --> 00:49:13.119
Quick! Please!

1128
00:49:13.161 --> 00:49:15.163
Seriously? What are you doing?

1129
00:49:15.205 --> 00:49:17.290
Winning you that
creepy. giant elf bear.

1130
00:49:17.332 --> 00:49:22.712
*

1131
00:49:22.754 --> 00:49:27.217
(crowd cheering. whistling)

1132
00:49:27.258 --> 00:49:29.219
Charlotte Carmichael wins.

1133
00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:34.432
(crowd applauding)

1134
00:49:40.188 --> 00:49:44.984
(both laughing)

1135
00:49:45.026 --> 00:49:47.821
Ah. you really saved
my butt back there.

1136
00:49:47.862 --> 00:49:51.574
Did you see the look
on Evan's face? Priceless.

1137
00:49:52.909 --> 00:49:55.829
Not all heroes wear capes.
I guess.

1138
00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:56.871
Just coveralls.

1139
00:49:56.913 --> 00:49:58.998
(both chuckling)

1140
00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:01.376
Oh. I can't believe
Evan is responsible

1141
00:50:01.418 --> 00:50:03.712
for ending the Elfcapades.

1142
00:50:03.753 --> 00:50:05.630
That was my dad's legacy.

1143
00:50:05.672 --> 00:50:08.341
Dee Dee's been doing everything
she can to keep it going.

1144
00:50:08.383 --> 00:50:09.509
She's heartbroken.

1145
00:50:09.551 --> 00:50:11.636
It's not right.

1146
00:50:11.678 --> 00:50:13.638
We need to save it.

1147
00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:14.764
How?

1148
00:50:14.806 --> 00:50:16.474
(sighing)
I don't know.

1149
00:50:16.516 --> 00:50:18.518
but I need to
think of something.

1150
00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:21.021
The Elfcapades is
important to this town.

1151
00:50:21.062 --> 00:50:22.647
It brings people together.

1152
00:50:22.689 --> 00:50:25.358
I completely agree.

1153
00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:28.903
I forgot how special the holiday
season is in this town.

1154
00:50:30.238 --> 00:50:32.365
I really feel
like I'm home again.

1155
00:50:32.407 --> 00:50:34.826
and I haven't felt that
way in a long time.

1156
00:50:34.868 --> 00:50:35.827
So. thank you.

1157
00:50:37.787 --> 00:50:38.955
Well. I feel the same way.

1158
00:50:41.082 --> 00:50:42.709
- Well--
- Well...

1159
00:50:42.751 --> 00:50:43.752
Goodnight. Spencer.

1160
00:50:43.793 --> 00:50:44.753
Goodnight. Charlotte.

1161
00:50:47.505 --> 00:50:54.471
*

1162
00:51:02.145 --> 00:51:04.481
(indistinct conversation)

1163
00:51:04.522 --> 00:51:06.191
Good morning. everyone.

1164
00:51:06.232 --> 00:51:07.275
Good morning. honey.

1165
00:51:07.317 --> 00:51:08.818
Oh. you look chipper.

1166
00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:09.861
I feel chipper.

1167
00:51:09.903 --> 00:51:10.904
Mm.

1168
00:51:10.945 --> 00:51:12.030
Peter: Oh. yeah?

1169
00:51:12.072 --> 00:51:13.365
Yeah!
My designs are coming along.

1170
00:51:13.406 --> 00:51:15.867
I'm actually excited
for the Elfcapades tonight.

1171
00:51:15.909 --> 00:51:17.369
Life is good.

1172
00:51:17.410 --> 00:51:19.496
Charlotte Carmichael getting
into the Christmas spirit.

1173
00:51:19.537 --> 00:51:21.122
Never thought I'd see the day.

1174
00:51:21.164 --> 00:51:23.249
Would this happen
to have to do anything

1175
00:51:23.291 --> 00:51:24.542
with a certain someone?

1176
00:51:24.584 --> 00:51:25.877
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1177
00:51:25.919 --> 00:51:27.170
Hm.

1178
00:51:27.212 --> 00:51:28.588
Can I pour you
a cup of coffee. Charlotte?

1179
00:51:30.006 --> 00:51:31.257
Yes. Rick. That'd be great.

1180
00:51:31.299 --> 00:51:32.467
Thank you.

1181
00:51:34.344 --> 00:51:37.430
Aunt Charlie. are you in love?

1182
00:51:37.472 --> 00:51:38.640
- (chuckling)
- What?

1183
00:51:38.682 --> 00:51:40.141
Love?

1184
00:51:40.183 --> 00:51:41.476
Who said anything about love?

1185
00:51:41.518 --> 00:51:43.728
Well I heard Mom
and Dad talking about

1186
00:51:43.770 --> 00:51:45.814
how you seem like
a smitten kitten.

1187
00:51:45.855 --> 00:51:47.482
(family laughing)

1188
00:51:47.524 --> 00:51:49.943
When are you going to
learn to stop eavesdropping?

1189
00:51:49.984 --> 00:51:51.111
- Never!
- (grunting)

1190
00:51:51.152 --> 00:51:53.655
Well. we think
he's perfect for you.

1191
00:51:53.697 --> 00:51:58.451
Guys. relax. okay?
It was just one kiss.

1192
00:51:58.493 --> 00:51:59.953
Mom. Christina. & Ben:
You guys kissed?!

1193
00:51:59.994 --> 00:52:01.329
Uh...

1194
00:52:01.371 --> 00:52:04.165
If I were you.
I'd have breakfast at Dee Dee's

1195
00:52:04.207 --> 00:52:05.917
before the interrogation.

1196
00:52:05.959 --> 00:52:06.918
- Good idea.
- No!

1197
00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:07.877
I'll see you guys later.

1198
00:52:07.919 --> 00:52:09.045
No! No!

1199
00:52:09.087 --> 00:52:10.463
Run. Charlotte. Run!

1200
00:52:10.505 --> 00:52:13.758
- No! No! Why? Why?!
- Save yourself.

1201
00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:22.934
*

1202
00:52:22.976 --> 00:52:23.893
Hey.

1203
00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:28.023
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

1204
00:52:28.064 --> 00:52:30.734
Charlie. you startled me. Uh...

1205
00:52:30.775 --> 00:52:33.319
I thought we weren't meeting up
'til later. What's going on?

1206
00:52:33.361 --> 00:52:34.404
I just had some time off

1207
00:52:34.446 --> 00:52:36.781
so I thought I'd come
check on my car.

1208
00:52:36.823 --> 00:52:39.409
Oh. well. I. uh...

1209
00:52:39.451 --> 00:52:43.038
I got the part.
so should be done today.

1210
00:52:43.079 --> 00:52:44.122
Radiator leak?

1211
00:52:44.164 --> 00:52:45.540
Yeah.

1212
00:52:46.875 --> 00:52:48.918
You gonna solder it?

1213
00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:50.920
I'm sorry. Who are you?

1214
00:52:50.962 --> 00:52:54.257
(chuckling)
My dad taught me all about cars.

1215
00:52:54.299 --> 00:52:55.550
He didn't want me
to get stranded in

1216
00:52:55.592 --> 00:52:57.385
the middle of nowhere
and not know the basics.

1217
00:52:57.427 --> 00:53:00.263
Benefits of having
a tow truck driver as a father.

1218
00:53:00.305 --> 00:53:01.681
Exactly.

1219
00:53:03.058 --> 00:53:04.934
So. um. I was wondering
if you could come by before

1220
00:53:04.976 --> 00:53:07.395
the Elfcapades
and try on a new design?

1221
00:53:07.437 --> 00:53:08.438
It's almost Christmas Eve

1222
00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:09.731
and I don't have
everything I need.

1223
00:53:09.773 --> 00:53:11.900
Yeah. of course.
Whatever you need.

1224
00:53:11.941 --> 00:53:13.234
Great.

1225
00:53:13.276 --> 00:53:17.822
And. uh.
speaking of Christmas Eve.

1226
00:53:17.864 --> 00:53:19.574
are you going to
miss the Pajamboree?

1227
00:53:19.616 --> 00:53:21.659
Well. the fashion show
is at 2:00.

1228
00:53:21.701 --> 00:53:23.244
should be out of there by 3:00.

1229
00:53:23.286 --> 00:53:24.788
and should be able
to make it in time.

1230
00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:25.997
It's going to be
cutting it close.

1231
00:53:26.039 --> 00:53:28.041
but I don't want to miss it

1232
00:53:28.083 --> 00:53:31.753
Great. I was. uh.
hoping that we'd go together.

1233
00:53:31.795 --> 00:53:33.546
Um...

1234
00:53:33.588 --> 00:53:37.092
Yeah. I'd like that.

1235
00:53:37.133 --> 00:53:39.803
Good. Cool.

1236
00:53:39.844 --> 00:53:41.429
All right. well.
I should get back to work.

1237
00:53:41.471 --> 00:53:44.557
Yes. thank you.

1238
00:53:44.599 --> 00:53:47.268
Oh. um. what times do you
want to meet for the Elfcapades?

1239
00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:49.229
Well. um...

1240
00:53:51.189 --> 00:53:52.524
Let's do a change of plans.

1241
00:53:52.565 --> 00:53:54.526
I'm gonna pick you up.

1242
00:53:54.567 --> 00:53:56.611
I got a surprise for you.

1243
00:53:56.653 --> 00:53:59.155
Spencer Dobbs
missing the Elfcapades?

1244
00:53:59.197 --> 00:54:00.407
Should I be scared?

1245
00:54:00.448 --> 00:54:03.201
Maybe. Maybe not.

1246
00:54:03.243 --> 00:54:05.537
Oh. playing the mystery card.

1247
00:54:05.578 --> 00:54:07.372
- Mm-hm.
- I'm intrigued.

1248
00:54:07.414 --> 00:54:09.958
Now. get out of here.
I gotta fix this car.

1249
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.502
Okay. okay. Bye.

1250
00:54:16.172 --> 00:54:21.094
(whirring)

1251
00:54:25.306 --> 00:54:26.975
- (sighing)
- Why the long face?

1252
00:54:27.017 --> 00:54:27.892
I don't know.

1253
00:54:29.269 --> 00:54:30.645
Something's off.

1254
00:54:30.687 --> 00:54:32.897
I like the general idea. but...

1255
00:54:34.524 --> 00:54:35.608
..that's not the right feeling.

1256
00:54:35.650 --> 00:54:37.902
Oh. what feeling
are you going for?

1257
00:54:37.944 --> 00:54:38.903
I don't know.

1258
00:54:38.945 --> 00:54:40.989
Like how it felt
when I was a kid.

1259
00:54:41.031 --> 00:54:42.032
Hm.

1260
00:54:43.074 --> 00:54:44.659
I have something.

1261
00:54:44.701 --> 00:54:48.621
*

1262
00:54:48.663 --> 00:54:53.335
Maybe this will remind you.

1263
00:54:53.376 --> 00:54:54.586
Hm?

1264
00:54:57.213 --> 00:54:58.256
Oh.

1265
00:54:59.299 --> 00:55:00.300
Yeah.

1266
00:55:04.137 --> 00:55:06.264
We really did have
the best Christmases. didn't we?

1267
00:55:06.306 --> 00:55:08.516
Yeah. we did.

1268
00:55:08.558 --> 00:55:10.769
And we still do.

1269
00:55:10.810 --> 00:55:12.228
It's just
a little different now.

1270
00:55:14.189 --> 00:55:15.273
Mm-hm.

1271
00:55:15.315 --> 00:55:17.067
You'll get there. honey.

1272
00:55:17.108 --> 00:55:18.068
Thanks. Mom.

1273
00:55:19.694 --> 00:55:23.531
Maybe you just need to step
away from this for a moment

1274
00:55:23.573 --> 00:55:25.617
in order to see it more clearly.

1275
00:55:25.658 --> 00:55:27.744
You know what?

1276
00:55:27.786 --> 00:55:29.037
I could use a break.

1277
00:55:29.079 --> 00:55:30.705
Now. that's a good idea.

1278
00:55:33.291 --> 00:55:34.834
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1279
00:55:43.843 --> 00:55:47.180
All right.
keep those eyes closed.

1280
00:55:47.222 --> 00:55:48.181
Okay.

1281
00:55:54.187 --> 00:55:56.690
All right. come on down.
Keep those eyes closed.

1282
00:55:56.731 --> 00:55:57.857
I'm right here.

1283
00:56:01.486 --> 00:56:03.446
All right. watch out.
I got the door.

1284
00:56:03.488 --> 00:56:06.116
'Kay.

1285
00:56:06.157 --> 00:56:07.283
Now. come forward.

1286
00:56:07.325 --> 00:56:09.035
This is a lot like
the beginnings of those

1287
00:56:09.077 --> 00:56:11.496
true crime documentaries.
you know.

1288
00:56:11.538 --> 00:56:13.164
Come on.
You trust me. don't you?

1289
00:56:13.206 --> 00:56:15.458
Yeah. I do. I think.

1290
00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:17.210
Okay.

1291
00:56:17.252 --> 00:56:18.294
Open your eyes.

1292
00:56:22.465 --> 00:56:24.134
Is-- Is this?

1293
00:56:26.344 --> 00:56:27.721
I found it on
this dealer's site

1294
00:56:27.762 --> 00:56:30.390
for people who like
to restore old cars.

1295
00:56:30.432 --> 00:56:33.268
I decided to buy it.

1296
00:56:33.309 --> 00:56:37.063
fix it up. and.
I don't know...

1297
00:56:37.105 --> 00:56:39.274
Didn't feel right
letting it sit there

1298
00:56:39.315 --> 00:56:41.651
and just get bought
for parts.

1299
00:56:45.113 --> 00:56:46.781
You're really amazing.
you know that?

1300
00:56:49.284 --> 00:56:51.119
What do you say?

1301
00:56:51.161 --> 00:56:52.328
Wanna sit in it?

1302
00:56:54.622 --> 00:56:55.957
Come on.

1303
00:56:55.999 --> 00:57:06.009
*

1304
00:57:14.809 --> 00:57:15.810
(door closing)

1305
00:57:15.852 --> 00:57:18.396
This looks exactly
the same.

1306
00:57:21.858 --> 00:57:24.694
I love these
old '90s radios.

1307
00:57:24.736 --> 00:57:26.154
They don't make 'em
like this anymore.

1308
00:57:26.196 --> 00:57:28.948
And I wonder if
it's still got some juice.

1309
00:57:31.576 --> 00:57:36.081
(song playing on radio)

1310
00:57:37.123 --> 00:57:46.966
*

1311
00:57:47.008 --> 00:57:48.218
Is that--

1312
00:57:51.304 --> 00:57:52.555
Huh.

1313
00:57:52.597 --> 00:57:53.848
No way.

1314
00:57:53.890 --> 00:57:56.059
Are those his coveralls?

1315
00:57:57.686 --> 00:57:59.062
Yeah.

1316
00:58:01.564 --> 00:58:02.899
(chuckling)

1317
00:58:06.319 --> 00:58:08.905
This is the greatest gift
you could have ever given me.

1318
00:58:08.947 --> 00:58:16.538
*

1319
00:58:16.579 --> 00:58:18.540
Can I ask you something?

1320
00:58:18.581 --> 00:58:20.500
Yeah. of course.

1321
00:58:21.835 --> 00:58:24.004
How come you haven't dated?

1322
00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:26.756
Since...

1323
00:58:29.217 --> 00:58:32.804
I know. I need to get back into
the dating game at some point.

1324
00:58:35.765 --> 00:58:37.100
It's just...

1325
00:58:39.936 --> 00:58:43.023
Somehow moving on
just still felt wrong.

1326
00:58:44.774 --> 00:58:46.192
You know?

1327
00:58:46.234 --> 00:58:47.152
Mm.

1328
00:58:48.486 --> 00:58:49.779
I know what you mean.

1329
00:58:54.659 --> 00:58:56.286
It's hard letting go.

1330
00:58:57.746 --> 00:59:00.081
That's why I moved here.

1331
00:59:00.123 --> 00:59:02.042
Is it helping?

1332
00:59:05.962 --> 00:59:07.172
It's starting to.

1333
00:59:09.466 --> 00:59:19.434
*

1334
00:59:32.447 --> 00:59:33.740
Chris.

1335
00:59:33.782 --> 00:59:35.784
- Wake up.
- (snorting)

1336
00:59:35.825 --> 00:59:38.244
What took you so long?

1337
00:59:38.286 --> 00:59:39.371
It's eight o'clock.

1338
00:59:39.412 --> 00:59:40.580
Oh.

1339
00:59:41.915 --> 00:59:43.333
Did you have a good time?

1340
00:59:43.375 --> 00:59:46.002
I had the best time.

1341
00:59:46.044 --> 00:59:47.962
I think you were right.

1342
00:59:48.004 --> 00:59:50.173
I think
I'm a smitten kitten.

1343
00:59:50.215 --> 00:59:52.092
- (both laughing)
- Tell me everything.

1344
00:59:56.137 --> 01:00:06.064
*

1345
01:00:06.106 --> 01:00:09.859
Spencer. you're up early.
Can I get you a coffee?

1346
01:00:09.901 --> 01:00:11.361
That would be great.
Thanks.

1347
01:00:12.654 --> 01:00:14.072
Everything all right?

1348
01:00:14.114 --> 01:00:15.573
Yeah.

1349
01:00:17.742 --> 01:00:20.036
No. I don't know.
I. uh...

1350
01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:24.207
I could use
some advice actually.

1351
01:00:24.249 --> 01:00:26.209
What's going on?

1352
01:00:26.251 --> 01:00:27.585
Well...

1353
01:00:29.754 --> 01:00:31.256
There's this person.

1354
01:00:33.341 --> 01:00:36.011
And I can't stop
thinking about her.

1355
01:00:36.052 --> 01:00:38.221
but I don't know
what to do about it.

1356
01:00:38.263 --> 01:00:40.056
Ah. so you've caught the feels.

1357
01:00:40.098 --> 01:00:42.434
Yup.

1358
01:00:42.475 --> 01:00:43.601
Does she know?

1359
01:00:45.311 --> 01:00:46.855
And I don't know
if I should tell her.

1360
01:00:46.896 --> 01:00:48.982
How come?

1361
01:00:49.024 --> 01:00:51.943
I don't know. Dee.

1362
01:00:51.985 --> 01:00:53.570
Laura's been gone
for almost three years.

1363
01:00:53.611 --> 01:00:58.450
but it still feels wrong
thinking about someone else.

1364
01:01:01.953 --> 01:01:05.206
I'm worried that if
I start falling for someone new

1365
01:01:05.248 --> 01:01:07.042
I'll forget about her entirely.

1366
01:01:07.083 --> 01:01:11.004
Darling. losing someone
we love is a type of grief

1367
01:01:11.046 --> 01:01:13.381
that never fully heals.

1368
01:01:13.423 --> 01:01:16.051
Laura will always
be a part of you.

1369
01:01:16.092 --> 01:01:18.219
The love you two
shared will never go away.

1370
01:01:18.261 --> 01:01:21.431
But to cut yourself
off from loving again.

1371
01:01:21.473 --> 01:01:23.558
that's a true tragedy.

1372
01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:25.435
You're right.

1373
01:01:26.853 --> 01:01:28.480
If I could give you any advice.

1374
01:01:28.521 --> 01:01:32.275
it'd be to tell this new
someone how you really feel.

1375
01:01:32.317 --> 01:01:34.486
I regret not telling my
brother how much I loved him.

1376
01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:37.280
Life is short.

1377
01:01:37.322 --> 01:01:39.991
Don't waste it by
withholding your feelings.

1378
01:01:40.033 --> 01:01:42.994
There's never a right time.
There's only now.

1379
01:01:44.162 --> 01:01:54.130
*

1380
01:01:58.510 --> 01:01:59.636
(knocking)

1381
01:02:05.350 --> 01:02:07.477
Oh. Spencer! Hi.

1382
01:02:07.519 --> 01:02:09.062
Hi. Olivia.

1383
01:02:09.104 --> 01:02:11.398
Is Charlotte home?

1384
01:02:11.439 --> 01:02:12.649
You bet. come in.

1385
01:02:12.691 --> 01:02:13.983
Okay. great. Thank you.

1386
01:02:14.025 --> 01:02:15.735
She's just upstairs.

1387
01:02:15.777 --> 01:02:17.570
Okay.

1388
01:02:17.612 --> 01:02:21.282
The designs are all set.
I just need to helm the sleeves.

1389
01:02:21.324 --> 01:02:22.992
Margo: I can't believe
you pulled it all off

1390
01:02:23.034 --> 01:02:24.869
on your own in just six days.

1391
01:02:24.911 --> 01:02:26.329
Definitely wasn't all on my own.

1392
01:02:26.371 --> 01:02:28.832
My friend. Spencer Dobbs.
who you'll meet.

1393
01:02:28.873 --> 01:02:30.500
he was such a big help.

1394
01:02:30.542 --> 01:02:32.460
I couldn't have
done it without him.

1395
01:02:32.502 --> 01:02:36.297
Margo: Ooh-la-la. Who's this
Spencer Dobbs you speak of?

1396
01:02:36.339 --> 01:02:38.508
He's so great. You'd love him.

1397
01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:40.510
He totally helped me
get out of my head.

1398
01:02:40.552 --> 01:02:43.346
and reminded me why
I love designing so much.

1399
01:02:43.388 --> 01:02:45.849
and how much I love Christmas.

1400
01:02:45.890 --> 01:02:49.310
Margo: Huh. When will I get to
meet this boyfriend of yours?

1401
01:02:49.352 --> 01:02:51.354
Oh. no. He is not my boyfriend.

1402
01:02:51.396 --> 01:02:53.815
I mean. he's great.
but Alistair's in New York.

1403
01:02:53.857 --> 01:02:57.736
you're in New York.
He's a local Brooksbend mechanic

1404
01:02:57.777 --> 01:02:59.571
who wears coveralls all day.

1405
01:02:59.612 --> 01:03:01.197
I mean. it'll never work.

1406
01:03:05.702 --> 01:03:07.871
I don't know. maybe it could.

1407
01:03:07.912 --> 01:03:09.205
He's pretty amazing.

1408
01:03:09.247 --> 01:03:11.458
He reminds me a lot of my dad.

1409
01:03:13.251 --> 01:03:22.218
*

1410
01:03:24.095 --> 01:03:26.014
Still haven't
heard from him. huh?

1411
01:03:26.056 --> 01:03:28.183
I hope he's all right.

1412
01:03:28.224 --> 01:03:30.143
We were supposed to celebrate
the pajamas being done.

1413
01:03:30.185 --> 01:03:31.686
Oh. can I see?

1414
01:03:36.107 --> 01:03:39.944
Oh. wow.
They are so cute. Well done.

1415
01:03:39.986 --> 01:03:41.613
Thanks.

1416
01:03:41.654 --> 01:03:44.282
Maybe he just forgot
and he's at his shop.

1417
01:03:44.324 --> 01:03:46.451
You know how men can be.

1418
01:03:46.493 --> 01:03:56.461
*

1419
01:03:57.962 --> 01:03:59.756
Spencer.

1420
01:03:59.798 --> 01:04:01.883
- Hey.
- Hey. what happened?

1421
01:04:01.925 --> 01:04:03.843
I was waiting
for you at Dee Dee's.

1422
01:04:03.885 --> 01:04:06.054
Brought you a coffee.

1423
01:04:06.096 --> 01:04:07.764
Must have slipped my mind.

1424
01:04:07.806 --> 01:04:09.057
Okay. Uh--

1425
01:04:09.099 --> 01:04:10.392
She's all yours.

1426
01:04:12.852 --> 01:04:13.978
Are you okay?

1427
01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:17.273
Oh. I'm fine.

1428
01:04:17.315 --> 01:04:19.984
Are you sure?
You seem a little off.

1429
01:04:20.026 --> 01:04:21.611
Do I?

1430
01:04:24.155 --> 01:04:26.741
Must be because
I'm just a local mechanic.

1431
01:04:26.783 --> 01:04:28.910
What?

1432
01:04:28.952 --> 01:04:31.287
I heard you on
the phone this morning.

1433
01:04:32.914 --> 01:04:34.582
It's real nice. Charlie.

1434
01:04:34.624 --> 01:04:38.294
Wait. wait. Spencer. hang on.
I can explain.

1435
01:04:38.336 --> 01:04:40.255
No. it's okay.
Don't bother. I get it.

1436
01:04:40.296 --> 01:04:42.841
I'm just some small-town nobody.

1437
01:04:42.882 --> 01:04:44.884
I'm not good enough for
some bigshot fashion designer.

1438
01:04:44.926 --> 01:04:46.136
It's okay.

1439
01:04:46.177 --> 01:04:49.180
What? No. no. Please. Spencer.

1440
01:04:49.222 --> 01:04:51.307
I was just talking to
my closest friend about

1441
01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:55.186
how I wasn't sure if
long-distance would work.

1442
01:04:55.228 --> 01:04:57.105
You clearly didn't hear
the full conversation.

1443
01:04:57.147 --> 01:04:58.523
I didn't need to.

1444
01:05:00.608 --> 01:05:02.235
So that's it?

1445
01:05:02.277 --> 01:05:05.947
One small misunderstanding
and you just freeze me out?

1446
01:05:05.989 --> 01:05:09.242
Charlotte. I can't be with
somebody who cares more about

1447
01:05:09.284 --> 01:05:11.327
their career than their family.

1448
01:05:14.581 --> 01:05:16.624
I think you're just afraid
to move on from Laura.

1449
01:05:16.666 --> 01:05:18.001
Listen.
I got a lot of work to do.

1450
01:05:18.043 --> 01:05:19.711
Take your car and go.

1451
01:05:19.753 --> 01:05:20.795
- Spencer. could you just--
- No. could you please just--

1452
01:05:20.837 --> 01:05:22.047
- (gasping)
- Oh.

1453
01:05:22.088 --> 01:05:24.174
(sighing)

1454
01:05:24.215 --> 01:05:25.800
God. Charlotte. I'm so sorry.

1455
01:05:25.842 --> 01:05:27.010
Let me--

1456
01:05:27.052 --> 01:05:28.595
No. please.

1457
01:05:28.636 --> 01:05:29.804
(sighing)

1458
01:05:33.725 --> 01:05:36.519
Thanks. Spencer.

1459
01:05:36.561 --> 01:05:39.230
I guess this last week together
really was just a waste of time.

1460
01:05:42.567 --> 01:05:47.572
*

1461
01:05:48.907 --> 01:05:58.875
*

1462
01:06:01.836 --> 01:06:05.715
(family laughing. chatting)

1463
01:06:07.467 --> 01:06:09.094
Christina:
Okay. Rick. Right on. right on.

1464
01:06:09.135 --> 01:06:11.596
Okay. that's looking good.

1465
01:06:11.638 --> 01:06:12.847
Hey.

1466
01:06:12.889 --> 01:06:14.057
What are you guys doing?

1467
01:06:14.099 --> 01:06:15.433
Oh. Hi. honey. Come. sit.

1468
01:06:15.475 --> 01:06:16.976
Yeah. just like old times.

1469
01:06:17.018 --> 01:06:18.812
Um...

1470
01:06:18.853 --> 01:06:20.397
Is everything okay. Charlie?

1471
01:06:20.438 --> 01:06:23.400
My name is Charlotte.
Only my family calls me Charlie.

1472
01:06:23.441 --> 01:06:26.069
Oh. honey.
Don't talk to him like that.

1473
01:06:26.111 --> 01:06:27.821
And you're sitting
in my dad's chair.

1474
01:06:27.862 --> 01:06:30.365
Char. Don't.

1475
01:06:30.407 --> 01:06:33.410
Don't what? Talk about Dad?

1476
01:06:34.703 --> 01:06:35.995
Yeah. you'd like that.
wouldn't you?

1477
01:06:36.037 --> 01:06:37.622
Excuse me?

1478
01:06:37.664 --> 01:06:41.251
Ever since Dad died.
nobody even talks about him

1479
01:06:41.292 --> 01:06:44.629
or mentions him.
It's like he never existed.

1480
01:06:44.671 --> 01:06:47.507
And now you have
Rick replacing him

1481
01:06:47.549 --> 01:06:49.926
like an actor
in some bad sitcom.

1482
01:06:49.968 --> 01:06:52.095
How would you know whether
or not we talk about him?

1483
01:06:52.137 --> 01:06:53.763
You're never here.

1484
01:06:53.805 --> 01:06:56.099
We talk about him
all the time. Charlotte.

1485
01:06:56.141 --> 01:06:57.434
Just not when you come to visit.

1486
01:06:57.475 --> 01:06:59.144
because we don't
want you to feel bad.

1487
01:06:59.185 --> 01:07:00.770
Feel bad?

1488
01:07:00.812 --> 01:07:01.980
About what?

1489
01:07:03.815 --> 01:07:05.191
What? Tell me!

1490
01:07:05.233 --> 01:07:07.485
Just be real with
yourself for once.

1491
01:07:07.527 --> 01:07:10.739
The reason why you're upset
isn't because of Rick.

1492
01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:13.366
It's because you feel guilty
that you didn't come home

1493
01:07:13.408 --> 01:07:15.660
when Dad needed you most.

1494
01:07:15.702 --> 01:07:17.120
Saving the Elfcapades
isn't going to

1495
01:07:17.162 --> 01:07:18.580
bring him back. Charlotte.

1496
01:07:18.621 --> 01:07:21.750
You don't make time for people.

1497
01:07:21.791 --> 01:07:24.461
And if you're not careful.
you're going to end up alone.

1498
01:07:29.174 --> 01:07:31.343
Um...

1499
01:07:31.384 --> 01:07:35.013
My car's fixed and my pajamas
are completely ruined.

1500
01:07:35.055 --> 01:07:38.058
So. uh. there's no need
for me to stay here any longer

1501
01:07:38.099 --> 01:07:40.352
than I have to.

1502
01:07:40.393 --> 01:07:42.020
I'm going to head for
New York first thing tomorrow.

1503
01:07:42.062 --> 01:07:44.064
No. Charlotte. Hold on.

1504
01:07:45.565 --> 01:07:50.570
(crying)

1505
01:07:58.828 --> 01:08:07.337
*

1506
01:08:07.379 --> 01:08:08.755
(knocking)

1507
01:08:11.091 --> 01:08:12.217
Hey.

1508
01:08:12.258 --> 01:08:13.927
Hi.

1509
01:08:13.968 --> 01:08:15.136
Can I come in?

1510
01:08:15.178 --> 01:08:16.513
Mm-hm.

1511
01:08:18.431 --> 01:08:19.891
I was up all night.

1512
01:08:19.933 --> 01:08:22.060
Me. too.

1513
01:08:22.102 --> 01:08:23.436
Don't go.

1514
01:08:25.438 --> 01:08:26.856
I think it's better this way.

1515
01:08:26.898 --> 01:08:29.109
I clearly make
a mess of everything.

1516
01:08:30.318 --> 01:08:33.405
I'm so sorry about what I said.

1517
01:08:33.446 --> 01:08:36.741
It's just been hard
these past few years.

1518
01:08:36.783 --> 01:08:38.410
I know.

1519
01:08:38.451 --> 01:08:40.787
I miss my little sister.

1520
01:08:43.123 --> 01:08:44.582
No. I'm sorry. too.

1521
01:08:45.834 --> 01:08:48.044
I've just been
completely wrapped up

1522
01:08:48.086 --> 01:08:50.797
in my own little world trying
to make a name for myself.

1523
01:08:52.173 --> 01:08:54.426
And then when Dad got sick.

1524
01:08:54.467 --> 01:08:58.054
I just buried myself
deeper in work.

1525
01:08:58.096 --> 01:08:59.514
I couldn't face the truth.

1526
01:09:01.975 --> 01:09:03.977
Everyone deals with
grief differently.

1527
01:09:05.770 --> 01:09:08.440
I just wanted to
make you guys proud.

1528
01:09:08.481 --> 01:09:12.193
To prove that I was
capable of greatness.

1529
01:09:12.235 --> 01:09:14.988
You did do that.

1530
01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:16.865
But at what cost?

1531
01:09:16.906 --> 01:09:19.492
Seeing you guys
a few times a year?

1532
01:09:19.534 --> 01:09:22.162
Having no
meaningful relationships?

1533
01:09:22.203 --> 01:09:25.749
I wasn't even there at
the end when he needed me most.

1534
01:09:25.790 --> 01:09:28.209
Don't beat yourself up. okay?

1535
01:09:28.251 --> 01:09:30.712
Dad knows how much you love him.

1536
01:09:30.754 --> 01:09:33.548
Yeah. Spencer was right.

1537
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:35.717
What do you mean?

1538
01:09:35.759 --> 01:09:39.346
(groaning)
We got in this huge fight.

1539
01:09:39.387 --> 01:09:41.181
I've ruined
everything between us.

1540
01:09:42.682 --> 01:09:44.559
Not to mention
tomorrow's Christmas Eve

1541
01:09:44.601 --> 01:09:46.978
and I don't have anything
for the fashion show.

1542
01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:50.065
So fix it.

1543
01:09:50.106 --> 01:09:51.316
How?

1544
01:09:51.358 --> 01:09:53.151
I don't know. but I'll help.

1545
01:09:53.193 --> 01:09:56.654
I'm a pretty excellent sewer.
in case you forgot.

1546
01:09:59.074 --> 01:10:00.408
Come on!

1547
01:10:00.450 --> 01:10:02.160
Dad wouldn't want
you to give up.

1548
01:10:02.202 --> 01:10:04.120
I just don't know.

1549
01:10:08.166 --> 01:10:10.543
Wait.

1550
01:10:11.419 --> 01:10:12.671
I have an idea.

1551
01:10:16.049 --> 01:10:17.676
This?

1552
01:10:17.717 --> 01:10:19.594
What do you think?

1553
01:10:19.636 --> 01:10:21.304
- Uh. no.
- Okay. okay.

1554
01:10:21.346 --> 01:10:23.848
It doesn't seem good.
All right.

1555
01:10:23.890 --> 01:10:25.725
Oh.

1556
01:10:27.977 --> 01:10:30.188
Char.

1557
01:10:30.230 --> 01:10:31.523
Oh!

1558
01:10:31.564 --> 01:10:33.650
That's perfect.

1559
01:10:33.692 --> 01:10:35.026
- I love it.
- Yeah?

1560
01:10:35.068 --> 01:10:36.027
Yeah. let's do it.

1561
01:10:36.069 --> 01:10:37.237
Yay!

1562
01:10:39.572 --> 01:10:41.741
Charlotte. I--

1563
01:10:41.783 --> 01:10:44.035
I'm so glad
that you're here.

1564
01:10:44.077 --> 01:10:45.286
We thought you left.

1565
01:10:45.328 --> 01:10:49.124
Oh. Char.
You're still here.

1566
01:10:49.165 --> 01:10:52.002
Look. I know I haven't been
the greatest sister

1567
01:10:52.043 --> 01:10:54.671
or daughter.
or step-daughter.

1568
01:10:56.131 --> 01:10:58.717
But I want to try harder.

1569
01:10:58.758 --> 01:11:00.927
I really want to be
a part of this family.

1570
01:11:02.262 --> 01:11:04.889
I just miss Dad.

1571
01:11:04.931 --> 01:11:08.226
And sometimes it's really hard
for me to accept that he's gone.

1572
01:11:08.268 --> 01:11:11.896
Oh. it's hard for us. too.

1573
01:11:11.938 --> 01:11:15.650
but he will always be
a part of this family.

1574
01:11:15.692 --> 01:11:16.985
No matter what.

1575
01:11:18.945 --> 01:11:21.406
I know.

1576
01:11:21.448 --> 01:11:24.617
And I'm sorry
I've been so hard on you.

1577
01:11:24.659 --> 01:11:27.287
I never wanted you to
think that I was trying

1578
01:11:27.328 --> 01:11:28.663
to replace your dad.

1579
01:11:28.705 --> 01:11:30.623
I had great respect for him.

1580
01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:34.085
He was a dear friend.

1581
01:11:34.127 --> 01:11:35.962
I know.

1582
01:11:36.004 --> 01:11:37.756
And you've been
nothing but kind.

1583
01:11:37.797 --> 01:11:39.632
and you've made my mom so happy.

1584
01:11:39.674 --> 01:11:42.302
And I've been nothing
but rude to you.

1585
01:11:44.346 --> 01:11:45.638
And you don't deserve that.

1586
01:11:46.806 --> 01:11:48.600
I hope you can forgive me.

1587
01:11:48.641 --> 01:11:50.143
Of course. Charlotte.

1588
01:11:52.312 --> 01:11:53.646
Call me Charlie.

1589
01:11:55.315 --> 01:11:59.569
This really feels like
a group hug kind of moment.

1590
01:11:59.611 --> 01:12:01.321
- Yes!
- (laughing)

1591
01:12:01.363 --> 01:12:02.864
Aww.

1592
01:12:02.906 --> 01:12:05.283
Oh. so. what's with
all the new fabric?

1593
01:12:05.325 --> 01:12:08.328
Oh. well. I am going to
make Christmas coveralls for

1594
01:12:08.370 --> 01:12:10.246
the Warwick's Fashion Show.

1595
01:12:10.288 --> 01:12:12.916
Each pair is going to come
with its own embroidery set

1596
01:12:12.957 --> 01:12:14.709
for each person to
sew their name into.

1597
01:12:14.751 --> 01:12:16.378
Just like real coveralls.

1598
01:12:16.419 --> 01:12:20.298
Isn't the fashion show tomorrow?

1599
01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:23.635
Yes. which is why
we need all hands on deck.

1600
01:12:23.677 --> 01:12:25.929
Ah. okay.

1601
01:12:25.970 --> 01:12:28.932
Wh-- What do we do?
Okay. let's go!

1602
01:12:28.973 --> 01:12:32.894
(whirring)

1603
01:12:34.521 --> 01:12:44.698
*

1604
01:12:48.535 --> 01:12:50.745
These are turning out great.

1605
01:12:50.787 --> 01:12:52.038
I want a pair.

1606
01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:52.914
(laughing)

1607
01:12:52.956 --> 01:12:54.541
Agreed. I'd actually wear these.

1608
01:12:54.582 --> 01:12:56.668
Don't worry.
by this time next year.

1609
01:12:56.710 --> 01:12:58.461
you can all buy
them at Warwick's.

1610
01:12:58.503 --> 01:13:01.339
Maybe. but either way I'd be
happy to make you each a pair.

1611
01:13:01.381 --> 01:13:06.469
Mm-hm. Well. the women's pair
is pretty much done.

1612
01:13:06.511 --> 01:13:08.596
Great. Is there anything else I
can do?

1613
01:13:08.638 --> 01:13:11.391
Uh. do you guys
think we have time to

1614
01:13:11.433 --> 01:13:14.352
make an extra pair of men's?

1615
01:13:14.394 --> 01:13:15.854
- Backup. great idea.
- Mm.

1616
01:13:15.895 --> 01:13:18.606
Actually. I had
something else in mind.

1617
01:13:18.648 --> 01:13:20.025
Here you go.

1618
01:13:20.066 --> 01:13:22.318
Thank you.

1619
01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:23.486
Wish me luck.

1620
01:13:24.904 --> 01:13:26.322
Ah. we love you. Charlie.

1621
01:13:26.364 --> 01:13:28.074
Aw. I love you guys. too.

1622
01:13:28.116 --> 01:13:30.827
If you don't make it back in
time for Pajamboree don't worry.

1623
01:13:30.869 --> 01:13:33.121
Just as long as we get
you on Christmas morning.

1624
01:13:33.163 --> 01:13:35.457
I will make it back.
mark my words.

1625
01:13:35.498 --> 01:13:36.583
'Kay.

1626
01:13:36.624 --> 01:13:38.001
Thanks for everything.

1627
01:13:38.043 --> 01:13:39.044
Got it.

1628
01:13:39.085 --> 01:13:39.878
Here.

1629
01:13:39.919 --> 01:13:42.213
Knock 'em dead. honey.

1630
01:13:42.255 --> 01:13:43.381
I'll try.

1631
01:13:43.423 --> 01:13:44.841
- Bye.
- Bye.

1632
01:13:52.682 --> 01:13:55.393
Hey.

1633
01:13:55.435 --> 01:13:56.519
- Hey.
- Hey.

1634
01:13:58.938 --> 01:14:00.732
Shouldn't you be
on your way to New York?

1635
01:14:00.774 --> 01:14:03.985
Uh. I wanted to
give you this before I left.

1636
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:09.407
It's the new design.

1637
01:14:13.119 --> 01:14:15.080
Thanks.

1638
01:14:15.121 --> 01:14:18.792
And I just wanted
to say that I'm sorry.

1639
01:14:21.127 --> 01:14:23.922
This last week with you has been

1640
01:14:23.963 --> 01:14:26.383
the happiest
I've felt in a while.

1641
01:14:26.424 --> 01:14:28.927
And I mean that.

1642
01:14:28.968 --> 01:14:35.600
*

1643
01:14:35.642 --> 01:14:38.311
Anyway. um.
if I don't see you later...

1644
01:14:40.647 --> 01:14:41.898
Merry Christmas. Spencer.

1645
01:14:43.775 --> 01:14:45.819
Merry Christmas. Charlotte.

1646
01:14:49.239 --> 01:14:59.207
*

1647
01:15:09.634 --> 01:15:10.969
(sighing)

1648
01:15:23.565 --> 01:15:27.360
*

1649
01:15:27.402 --> 01:15:29.362
(sighing)

1650
01:15:29.404 --> 01:15:30.864
Roger: Charlotte.

1651
01:15:30.905 --> 01:15:33.241
- Hi.
- Welcome.

1652
01:15:33.283 --> 01:15:35.201
Can you take that for me?
Thanks.

1653
01:15:35.243 --> 01:15:36.619
Can't wait to see
what you brought us.

1654
01:15:36.661 --> 01:15:38.038
Oh. thank you. Roger.

1655
01:15:38.079 --> 01:15:40.498
Um. I thought we were
getting started at 2:00.

1656
01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:43.001
You didn't get the email? No.

1657
01:15:43.043 --> 01:15:45.670
We pushed it to 3:00.

1658
01:15:45.712 --> 01:15:48.006
But at this rate it's probably
going to be more like 3:30.

1659
01:15:48.048 --> 01:15:50.175
What? But it's Christmas Eve.

1660
01:15:52.135 --> 01:15:54.012
Sorry. Charlotte.
You know how these things go.

1661
01:15:55.472 --> 01:15:57.974
You'll be out of here by 5:30.
the latest.

1662
01:15:58.016 --> 01:16:00.060
I have an event tonight with
my family at 8:00.

1663
01:16:00.101 --> 01:16:02.103
and it'll take
four hours to get there.

1664
01:16:02.145 --> 01:16:04.314
and Christmas traffic
it'll probably take longer.

1665
01:16:04.356 --> 01:16:06.983
I'm sure your family
will understand.

1666
01:16:07.025 --> 01:16:08.902
Wow. Would you look at these.

1667
01:16:08.943 --> 01:16:11.404
These are great.

1668
01:16:11.446 --> 01:16:14.908
I really can't wait
for everyone to see them.

1669
01:16:14.949 --> 01:16:18.328
Well. unfortunately. they won't.

1670
01:16:18.370 --> 01:16:20.205
What do you mean?

1671
01:16:22.165 --> 01:16:23.875
Would you guys mind going
and taking these off

1672
01:16:23.917 --> 01:16:25.418
and bringing them to me
as quick as you can?

1673
01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:29.923
Please. right now.
Bring them to me. Thank you.

1674
01:16:29.964 --> 01:16:33.760
I'm sorry. Roger. I have
somewhere else I have to be.

1675
01:16:33.802 --> 01:16:37.931
Charlotte. you do know this show
could be a game-changed for you.

1676
01:16:37.972 --> 01:16:41.685
I know. but family has
to come first this time.

1677
01:16:41.726 --> 01:16:43.269
I hope you'll forgive me. Roger.

1678
01:16:43.311 --> 01:16:44.771
I would love to
have designed for you.

1679
01:16:44.813 --> 01:16:46.815
but maybe next year?

1680
01:16:46.856 --> 01:16:48.441
Merry Christmas.

1681
01:16:49.484 --> 01:16:50.652
Merry Christmas.

1682
01:16:52.278 --> 01:17:02.247
*

1683
01:17:12.882 --> 01:17:14.801
* It's in the air *

1684
01:17:14.843 --> 01:17:17.387
* That Christmas feeling *

1685
01:17:17.429 --> 01:17:20.557
Man on megaphone: Welcome to
the final night of Elfcapades!

1686
01:17:20.598 --> 01:17:22.225
The Pajamboree.

1687
01:17:22.267 --> 01:17:24.769
* And hang the stockings *

1688
01:17:24.811 --> 01:17:28.481
(cheering)

1689
01:17:28.523 --> 01:17:30.066
(applauding)

1690
01:17:30.108 --> 01:17:32.652
It's so beautiful.

1691
01:17:32.694 --> 01:17:33.903
You're here!

1692
01:17:33.945 --> 01:17:35.655
Rick & Dee Dee:
Merry Christmas.

1693
01:17:35.697 --> 01:17:36.990
Merry Christmas. Dee Dee.

1694
01:17:37.032 --> 01:17:38.658
Oh. it's so soft. (laughing)

1695
01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:40.035
Any word yet?

1696
01:17:40.076 --> 01:17:41.494
Oh. just a text
a couple of hours ago

1697
01:17:41.536 --> 01:17:42.662
that she was on her way.

1698
01:17:42.704 --> 01:17:43.872
- Good.
- Mm-hm.

1699
01:17:43.913 --> 01:17:45.290
Yeah.

1700
01:17:45.331 --> 01:17:46.750
(cranking)

1701
01:17:46.791 --> 01:17:51.755
(phone ringing)

1702
01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:01.556
Come on. pick up.

1703
01:18:03.224 --> 01:18:04.976
Voicemail: Hi. this is Spencer.
Leave a message

1704
01:18:05.018 --> 01:18:06.853
and I'll get back to you.

1705
01:18:06.895 --> 01:18:08.188
Spencer. it's me.

1706
01:18:09.481 --> 01:18:10.565
(phone vibrating)

1707
01:18:17.405 --> 01:18:19.199
Charlotte: Spencer. it's me.

1708
01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:21.868
I can't stop thinking
about the way we left things.

1709
01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:25.038
I am so sorry if
I ever made you feel

1710
01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:27.040
small or less-than.

1711
01:18:27.082 --> 01:18:29.084
You are the most
incredible person.

1712
01:18:29.125 --> 01:18:30.877
and the only thing that
matters to me right now

1713
01:18:30.919 --> 01:18:32.587
is making things right with us.

1714
01:18:32.629 --> 01:18:34.464
and as crazy as it sounds--
(static buzzing)

1715
01:18:34.506 --> 01:18:37.008
--it might be--
(static buzzing)

1716
01:18:37.050 --> 01:18:38.426
Come on. Come on. come on.

1717
01:18:38.468 --> 01:18:40.345
--hope that you decide--
(static buzzing)

1718
01:18:40.387 --> 01:18:41.554
--night.

1719
01:18:44.015 --> 01:18:53.191
*

1720
01:18:54.401 --> 01:18:57.737
(horn honking. tires squealing)

1721
01:18:57.779 --> 01:19:03.827
*

1722
01:19:03.868 --> 01:19:06.621
I am so sorry.

1723
01:19:08.248 --> 01:19:10.041
But I'm really happy
to see you.

1724
01:19:10.083 --> 01:19:11.376
Are you?
'Cause. you know.

1725
01:19:11.418 --> 01:19:13.128
two accidents.
it starts to look intentional.

1726
01:19:13.169 --> 01:19:14.462
(laughing)

1727
01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:18.299
How did the show go?

1728
01:19:20.552 --> 01:19:22.387
It didn't.

1729
01:19:22.429 --> 01:19:23.596
I left.

1730
01:19:23.638 --> 01:19:25.015
You left?!

1731
01:19:25.056 --> 01:19:27.600
I promised my family
I'd be here.

1732
01:19:27.642 --> 01:19:30.020
And if there was any small
possibility

1733
01:19:30.061 --> 01:19:32.397
that I could see you.
I had to take it.

1734
01:19:34.441 --> 01:19:37.068
But Roger should see
the new designs. It's perfect.

1735
01:19:37.110 --> 01:19:39.904
I don't care about
any of that right now.

1736
01:19:39.946 --> 01:19:42.615
I care about you.

1737
01:19:42.657 --> 01:19:44.617
Really?

1738
01:19:44.659 --> 01:19:47.787
I know it sounds crazy.

1739
01:19:47.829 --> 01:19:50.707
But spending this past week
with you has made me realize

1740
01:19:50.749 --> 01:19:54.878
that the only important thing in
life is who you spend it with.

1741
01:19:54.919 --> 01:19:57.922
And I want to spend
every moment I can with you.

1742
01:20:01.217 --> 01:20:02.594
Charlotte. I. uh...

1743
01:20:02.635 --> 01:20:05.472
I love you. Spencer.

1744
01:20:05.513 --> 01:20:07.682
And it's okay if you
don't feel the same way

1745
01:20:07.724 --> 01:20:09.392
or you're not ready.

1746
01:20:11.311 --> 01:20:13.313
But I didn't want to
regret not telling you that.

1747
01:20:16.816 --> 01:20:17.776
Well. you're in luck.

1748
01:20:19.819 --> 01:20:20.862
'Cause I love you too.

1749
01:20:22.864 --> 01:20:23.865
Really?

1750
01:20:23.907 --> 01:20:25.492
Completely.

1751
01:20:25.533 --> 01:20:35.543
*

1752
01:20:39.172 --> 01:20:41.007
What now?

1753
01:20:41.049 --> 01:20:42.759
Now?

1754
01:20:42.801 --> 01:20:44.344
We go dance it up in style.

1755
01:20:45.637 --> 01:20:46.554
(laughing)

1756
01:20:48.223 --> 01:20:50.892
- Yes!
- (laughing)

1757
01:20:50.934 --> 01:20:52.018
- Ready?
- Yeah. let's do it.

1758
01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:53.603
Let's do it.

1759
01:20:53.645 --> 01:20:59.693
*

1760
01:20:59.734 --> 01:21:01.861
Charlie!

1761
01:21:01.903 --> 01:21:04.197
(both laughing)

1762
01:21:04.239 --> 01:21:05.532
- You made it!
- Yes!

1763
01:21:05.573 --> 01:21:07.909
Of course. I wouldn't miss it.

1764
01:21:07.951 --> 01:21:10.328
How did the show go?

1765
01:21:10.370 --> 01:21:11.996
I ditched it.

1766
01:21:12.038 --> 01:21:13.415
You what?

1767
01:21:13.456 --> 01:21:15.750
Being here with
you guys matters to me most.

1768
01:21:15.792 --> 01:21:16.793
Aww.

1769
01:21:16.835 --> 01:21:18.753
Oh. hold on.

1770
01:21:18.795 --> 01:21:21.381
It's-- It's Roger.

1771
01:21:21.423 --> 01:21:24.592
Probably calling to give me
the old Christmas Eve scolding.

1772
01:21:26.011 --> 01:21:27.012
Hello?

1773
01:21:27.053 --> 01:21:28.763
There's my all-star.

1774
01:21:28.805 --> 01:21:30.557
Pardon? What do you mean?

1775
01:21:30.598 --> 01:21:33.143
You know. that was really bold.
what you did.

1776
01:21:33.184 --> 01:21:35.061
Giving up on your dream
to be with your family.

1777
01:21:35.103 --> 01:21:37.731
I respect that. I really do.

1778
01:21:37.772 --> 01:21:39.941
And that's exactly the type
of person I want designing

1779
01:21:39.983 --> 01:21:41.609
for my home and family brand.

1780
01:21:41.651 --> 01:21:44.070
Not to mention
the fact I can't stop

1781
01:21:44.112 --> 01:21:45.822
thinking about those coveralls.

1782
01:21:45.864 --> 01:21:47.657
They are fantastic.

1783
01:21:47.699 --> 01:21:48.867
Are you serious?

1784
01:21:48.908 --> 01:21:50.535
I am.

1785
01:21:50.577 --> 01:21:53.246
We want exclusive rights to
sell them in all of our stores.

1786
01:21:53.288 --> 01:21:55.290
and I want to offer you
a one-year contract to

1787
01:21:55.331 --> 01:21:57.792
design for us exclusively.
What do you think of that?

1788
01:21:57.834 --> 01:21:59.586
(gasping)

1789
01:21:59.627 --> 01:22:02.422
I mean. yes. That's incredible.

1790
01:22:02.464 --> 01:22:05.300
I would love to.
Um. there's just one thing.

1791
01:22:05.342 --> 01:22:06.634
Roger: What's that?

1792
01:22:06.676 --> 01:22:08.511
I'd like to move
Alistair's headquarters

1793
01:22:08.553 --> 01:22:10.972
to Brooksbend. Connecticut.

1794
01:22:11.014 --> 01:22:12.932
As long as you can be in
New York a couple times a month

1795
01:22:12.974 --> 01:22:15.143
for meetings. you can
design wherever you like.

1796
01:22:15.185 --> 01:22:17.312
Then you have yourself a deal.

1797
01:22:17.354 --> 01:22:19.272
Roger: Perfect. I'll give you
a call in the New Year.

1798
01:22:19.314 --> 01:22:21.274
we'll go over the paperwork.

1799
01:22:21.316 --> 01:22:22.567
Merry Christmas. Charlotte.

1800
01:22:22.609 --> 01:22:24.069
Merry Christmas. Mr. Warwick.

1801
01:22:25.945 --> 01:22:26.905
I won!

1802
01:22:26.946 --> 01:22:30.116
(all cheering)

1803
01:22:30.158 --> 01:22:31.368
You did it.

1804
01:22:31.409 --> 01:22:32.786
No. we did it.

1805
01:22:32.827 --> 01:22:34.454
I never could have
done this without you.

1806
01:22:35.789 --> 01:22:38.124
Merry Christmas.
Charlotte Carmichael.

1807
01:22:38.166 --> 01:22:39.292
Ben. you wanna dance?

1808
01:22:39.334 --> 01:22:40.543
- Oh yeah!
- All right!

1809
01:22:40.585 --> 01:22:43.672
(all laughing. chatting)

1810
01:22:43.713 --> 01:22:50.887
*

1811
01:22:50.929 --> 01:22:52.013
* Bells are ringing *

1812
01:22:52.055 --> 01:22:55.308
* There's a magic in the air *

1813
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:56.976
* Choirs are singing *

1814
01:22:57.018 --> 01:23:00.146
* Full of joy
and happiness *

1815
01:23:00.188 --> 01:23:01.731
* Stars are bright *

1816
01:23:01.773 --> 01:23:03.942
* As we share
a winter's night *

1817
01:23:03.983 --> 01:23:05.860
* Here's to Christmas *

1818
01:23:07.862 --> 01:23:09.864
* Everybody feel
the magic in the air *

1819
01:23:13.159 --> 01:23:15.328
* Everybody. whoa-oh *

1820
01:23:15.370 --> 01:23:17.956
* Everybody. everybody *
