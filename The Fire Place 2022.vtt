00:02:03.494 --> 00:02:04.992
Hey. Marla.

4
00:02:05.061 --> 00:02:07.695
My cleaning service flaked.
so I can't make it.

5
00:02:07.764 --> 00:02:09.630
Yeah. it's been
a big ol' shit show.

6
00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.200
I had people checking in
to units that weren't cleaned.

7
00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.036
and now I'm here with a vacuum.

8
00:02:15.105 --> 00:02:17.472
No. no. you stay.
I'm fine.

9
00:02:17.541 --> 00:02:20.704
You know. I got my music.
It's -- It's kinda relaxing.

10
00:02:20.773 --> 00:02:21.944
Okay. now. bye-bye.

11
00:02:59.717 --> 00:03:01.416
Hi.
Can I help you?

12
00:03:01.485 --> 00:03:04.247
Yes. I'm having
a little bit of car trouble.

13
00:03:04.316 --> 00:03:08.589
These steep mountain roads.
they got me stuck.

14
00:03:08.658 --> 00:03:10.592
Can I borrow
your phone?

15
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:13.396
My phone?
Don't you have a cellphone?

16
00:03:13.465 --> 00:03:15.264
It -- It died.

17
00:03:15.333 --> 00:03:17.500
Guess it just ain't
my day.

18
00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.868
Oh. this here's my son.

19
00:03:23.707 --> 00:03:25.640
Wait. what are you --
No. you can't --

20
00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.909
No. what are you --
You can't come in here!

21
00:03:47.698 --> 00:03:49.931
I lost my pretty face.
She'll see me!

22
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.837
Don't worry. baby.
I got your pretty face.

23
00:03:54.906 --> 00:03:57.706
Remember.
say nice things to her.

24
00:03:57.775 --> 00:04:00.742
Girls like to hear
nice things.

25
00:04:26.971 --> 00:04:30.405
Did that feel good?

26
00:04:30.474 --> 00:04:32.941
Did you get
your yuckies out?

27
00:04:33.945 --> 00:04:36.844
I guess
she wasn't the one.

28
00:04:36.913 --> 00:04:40.349
You'll know when
the right one comes along.

29
00:04:40.418 --> 00:04:41.716
Right one.

30
00:04:41.785 --> 00:04:44.419
Oh. baby.
you certainly made a mess.

31
00:04:44.488 --> 00:04:46.391
I'll tell you that.

32
00:04:49.527 --> 00:04:54.830
All these cleaning supplies
sure do come in handy.

33
00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:56.668
Lucky for us.

34
00:04:59.837 --> 00:05:02.137
What you doing there.
baby?

35
00:05:02.206 --> 00:05:03.271
Evidence.

36
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.306
Evidence!

37
00:05:05.375 --> 00:05:06.509
Such a big word!

38
00:05:06.578 --> 00:05:09.779
You're such a smart man.

39
00:05:09.848 --> 00:05:12.517
You're destroying
evidence.

40
00:05:15.687 --> 00:05:18.318
Evidence.
Yes.

41
00:05:20.185 --> 00:05:23.058
But we can't
burn the body.

42
00:05:23.127 --> 00:05:26.394
No. bones don't burn.

43
00:05:26.463 --> 00:05:29.764
We're going to have to
bury the body somewhere

44
00:05:29.833 --> 00:05:34.336
and then just bury
the evidence with that.

45
00:05:34.405 --> 00:05:36.604
Like the digging game.

46
00:05:36.673 --> 00:05:39.909
You like the digging game?

47
00:05:39.978 --> 00:05:41.413
Huh?

48
00:05:42.975 --> 00:05:44.649
Alright.

49
00:05:51.522 --> 00:05:56.659
Oh. crappus dappus. baby.
We need to hide.

50
00:05:56.728 --> 00:05:59.327
Grab the body.
Help me.

51
00:05:59.396 --> 00:06:02.798
Oh. oh. come on.

52
00:06:02.867 --> 00:06:04.232
Good.

53
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.518
What'd I tell ya?

54
00:06:23.587 --> 00:06:24.619
Isn't this great?

55
00:06:24.688 --> 00:06:25.721
Yeah.
It's great. right?

56
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.122
Really nice.

57
00:06:27.191 --> 00:06:29.692
My lungs are not used
to all this clean air.

58
00:06:29.761 --> 00:06:31.692
At least
we got our steps in.

59
00:06:31.761 --> 00:06:33.394
Do you think
the cleaner came?

60
00:06:33.463 --> 00:06:37.465
Uh. she was supposed to be gone
at 4:00. and it is after 4:00.

61
00:06:37.534 --> 00:06:39.601
There's still dust
everywhere.

62
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:43.004
Well. babe. it's --
it's rustic. you know?

63
00:06:43.073 --> 00:06:44.873
I mean. supposedly
parts of this house

64
00:06:44.942 --> 00:06:46.708
were built
before the Civil War.

65
00:06:46.777 --> 00:06:48.043
So. uh.
I think we're probably

66
00:06:48.112 --> 00:06:50.345
just gonna have to
get used to the dust.

67
00:06:50.414 --> 00:06:52.514
Did you leave
the fireplace going?

68
00:06:52.583 --> 00:06:53.816
Or was that
the cleaning lady?

69
00:06:53.885 --> 00:06:56.617
Uh. no. that was --
that was me.

70
00:06:56.686 --> 00:06:58.287
I was filming
and I think I forgot.

71
00:06:58.356 --> 00:06:59.654
Alex.
that's super dangerous.

72
00:06:59.723 --> 00:07:02.157
You could've burned
the house down.

73
00:07:02.226 --> 00:07:06.428
I mean. I didn't. so that's --
that's good news.

74
00:07:06.497 --> 00:07:07.629
Hey. you want some wine?

75
00:07:07.698 --> 00:07:10.233
God. yes.
But I gotta pee first.

76
00:07:10.302 --> 00:07:11.937
Cool.

77
00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:31.419
Hey. you want to. uh.
go chill out by the fire.

78
00:07:31.488 --> 00:07:33.717
and I'll -- I'll serve you.

79
00:07:33.786 --> 00:07:34.622
Okay.

80
00:07:34.691 --> 00:07:35.957
Won't I mess up
your shot?

81
00:07:36.026 --> 00:07:37.320
No. no. no. no.
you're good.

82
00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:38.826
I'm actually pretty good
with that.

83
00:07:38.895 --> 00:07:41.030
I just. um -- I usually just
shoot for like an hour or two

84
00:07:41.099 --> 00:07:43.564
and then I find. like.
a little bit that I like.

85
00:07:43.633 --> 00:07:45.601
and I loop it --
corkscrew.

86
00:07:47.933 --> 00:07:51.540
Ah. found it.

87
00:07:51.609 --> 00:07:54.109
The cleaning lady
did the hearth.

88
00:07:54.178 --> 00:07:55.911
It's still wet.

89
00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:59.582
Oh. I was screwing
with that corkscrew.

90
00:07:59.651 --> 00:08:00.783
I didn't
even need to.

91
00:08:00.852 --> 00:08:03.222
Wine's a screw top.

92
00:08:06.991 --> 00:08:09.057
Mm.
Mm!

93
00:08:09.126 --> 00:08:11.293
Oh. fancy!

94
00:08:13.898 --> 00:08:17.532
Did you know
that screw tops

95
00:08:17.601 --> 00:08:19.435
are actually a lot better
for the wine?

96
00:08:19.504 --> 00:08:20.635
Hmm.

97
00:08:20.704 --> 00:08:22.837
But wine makers
keep using corks

98
00:08:22.906 --> 00:08:24.206
because they think
all of us just assume

99
00:08:24.275 --> 00:08:27.109
if something has a cork
that it's. like. nicer.

100
00:08:27.178 --> 00:08:29.777
Mm. Big Cork
suppressing the truth.

101
00:08:29.846 --> 00:08:31.880
I got your big cork
right here. baby.

102
00:08:31.949 --> 00:08:34.449
Hope it's bigger
than a cork.

103
00:08:34.518 --> 00:08:36.017
It's marginally bigger
than a cork.

104
00:08:36.086 --> 00:08:38.119
I know.
Just a little bit.

105
00:08:39.056 --> 00:08:41.022
To. um...

106
00:08:41.091 --> 00:08:44.725
To us.
The coral reefs not dying.

107
00:08:44.794 --> 00:08:48.430
To us and the coral reefs
not dying. yeah.

108
00:08:48.499 --> 00:08:50.932
I read something the other day.
they've got that. um.

109
00:08:51.001 --> 00:08:53.101
sunscreen that. like.
doesn't hurt the reefs?

110
00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.170
Pretty cool.
Yeah.
But they're still dying.

111
00:08:55.239 --> 00:08:58.139
There's a lot of things
that are killing it.

112
00:08:58.208 --> 00:09:01.776
Yeah. like I said. it's.
you know. always something.

113
00:09:01.845 --> 00:09:05.613
Would you like to join me
on this luxurious rug?

114
00:09:05.682 --> 00:09:07.683
Okay. I know
where this is going.

115
00:09:07.752 --> 00:09:09.819
What?
Is your camera still on?

116
00:09:09.887 --> 00:09:11.586
No. No.
I just wanted to...

117
00:09:11.655 --> 00:09:13.321
Mm-hmm.
...chill out on the rug.

118
00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:15.657
Yeah? 'Cause that one time
was a one-time deal.

119
00:09:15.726 --> 00:09:18.226
Oh. that one time was --
I'm not going to end up
in your sexy yule log video.

120
00:09:18.295 --> 00:09:20.961
Hey! Hey! Hey!
No. no. no. you say that now

121
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:24.166
until that cash starts rollin'
when we start that OnlyFans.

122
00:09:24.235 --> 00:09:26.767
Babe. I don't think that I want
to sit on a dead bear.

123
00:09:26.836 --> 00:09:28.904
I mean.
do you think it's real?

124
00:09:28.973 --> 00:09:30.840
Do I think this is
a fake bearskin rug?

125
00:09:30.909 --> 00:09:33.375
Is that even really
a thing. babe?

126
00:09:33.444 --> 00:09:36.645
It's just --
I dunno. It's cruel.

127
00:09:36.714 --> 00:09:38.213
Oh. it's cruel.
it's cruel.

128
00:09:38.282 --> 00:09:40.381
Says the girl wearing
leather boots.

129
00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:43.251
Okay. first of all.
there's no face on my boots.

130
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.921
And it's just --

131
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.323
I dunno.
It just feels weird. okay?

132
00:09:48.392 --> 00:09:50.420
Okay!
And. yeah.
he's just sitting there

133
00:09:50.489 --> 00:09:52.160
staring at us pissed.
Sure.

134
00:09:52.229 --> 00:09:54.096
I mean. I can --
I can move him.

135
00:09:54.165 --> 00:09:55.964
Why are you petting his head
like that?

136
00:09:56.033 --> 00:09:58.700
Because he's
a friend now.

137
00:09:58.769 --> 00:10:00.736
You actually look
really cute on it.

138
00:10:00.805 --> 00:10:01.971
Yeah?
Yeah.

139
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.407
In a...
sexy caveman kind of way.

140
00:10:05.476 --> 00:10:07.179
Oh?

141
00:10:12.416 --> 00:10:13.515
Don't let the boy see.

142
00:10:13.584 --> 00:10:15.350
Yeah.

143
00:10:15.419 --> 00:10:17.852
You look really good.
too. actually.
Oh.

144
00:10:17.921 --> 00:10:21.423
You got this. like.
sexy glow from the fireplace.

145
00:10:21.492 --> 00:10:23.325
You look like. um...

146
00:10:23.394 --> 00:10:24.993
Beyoncé?
...Beyoncé.

147
00:10:25.062 --> 00:10:26.695
Thank you.

148
00:10:26.764 --> 00:10:28.097
I love you.
I love you.

149
00:10:28.166 --> 00:10:29.531
Yeah?
Yeah.

150
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.936
Mm.

151
00:10:33.571 --> 00:10:36.305
Would the lady
like a snack?

152
00:10:36.374 --> 00:10:37.405
Mmm. always.

153
00:10:37.474 --> 00:10:38.441
Yeah?
Yeah.

154
00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:39.744
Okay.

155
00:10:54.158 --> 00:10:55.123
Okay.

156
00:10:55.192 --> 00:10:56.959
Ah. ah.
shit. shit shit!

157
00:10:57.028 --> 00:10:58.559
Mm! Damn it!
Hey. are you okay?

158
00:10:58.628 --> 00:11:00.395
Yeah. no.
I just got a --

159
00:11:00.464 --> 00:11:01.930
What's wrong? What's up?
I got a charley horse
or somethin'.

160
00:11:01.999 --> 00:11:03.698
It's not a big deal.
Oh. no. no. no.

161
00:11:03.767 --> 00:11:05.167
I might have some Tylenol.
No. I just got
to stretch it out.

162
00:11:05.236 --> 00:11:06.736
It's cool. it's cool.
it's cool. Listen.

163
00:11:06.805 --> 00:11:08.971
Listen. Zoe. Zoe.

164
00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.471
This last year with you
has been. like.

165
00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.275
the most rad year
of my life.
Good. babe.

166
00:11:13.344 --> 00:11:15.276
Yeah. and --
I've had a really
good time. too.

167
00:11:15.345 --> 00:11:17.178
Where is my Tylenol?
Um. there's only
really one thing

168
00:11:17.247 --> 00:11:19.013
that I think
could make it better.

169
00:11:19.082 --> 00:11:22.484
Babe. where'd you put
the Tylenol?
And that's if...

170
00:11:22.553 --> 00:11:25.754
you married me.

171
00:11:25.823 --> 00:11:29.424
Oh. my God!

172
00:11:29.493 --> 00:11:31.827
You said something was wrong
with your leg. you asshole!

173
00:11:31.896 --> 00:11:34.296
Well. I said
what I had to say!

174
00:11:34.365 --> 00:11:36.092
Oh. my God. Alex!

175
00:11:36.161 --> 00:11:37.767
It's so...

176
00:11:37.836 --> 00:11:39.668
It's so beautiful.

177
00:11:39.737 --> 00:11:40.836
Where'd you get it?

178
00:11:40.905 --> 00:11:42.804
It was Nana's.

179
00:11:42.873 --> 00:11:44.205
Kinda cheesy. I guess.
but. uh.

180
00:11:44.274 --> 00:11:47.242
I know you told me you didn't
want me to. you know.

181
00:11:47.311 --> 00:11:48.711
do the whole
blood diamond thing. so...

182
00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.146
And I love you for that.

183
00:11:51.215 --> 00:11:53.014
God. I --

184
00:11:53.083 --> 00:11:55.783
I'm just --
I'm -- I'm in shock. babe.

185
00:11:55.852 --> 00:11:57.552
You're in shock?
Are you serious?
Yes!

186
00:11:57.621 --> 00:12:00.055
I took you to this beautiful
mountain retreat.

187
00:12:00.124 --> 00:12:01.256
and you're --
and you're surprised?

188
00:12:01.325 --> 00:12:02.990
I-I've just been
working so much.

189
00:12:03.059 --> 00:12:06.729
I didn't even. weirdly.
think about it. I guess.

190
00:12:06.798 --> 00:12:08.931
Okay.

191
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.733
Oh. my God.

192
00:12:11.802 --> 00:12:14.570
Well. I mean...

193
00:12:14.639 --> 00:12:16.341
what do you say?

194
00:12:18.577 --> 00:12:20.041
Alex.

195
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:22.178
Babe. you know
I love you.

196
00:12:22.247 --> 00:12:23.579
Hmm?

197
00:12:23.648 --> 00:12:24.646
Hmm?

198
00:12:24.715 --> 00:12:26.047
Yeah.
Yeah.

199
00:12:26.116 --> 00:12:28.416
I mean. you're -- you're kinda
scaring me right now.

200
00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:34.223
Um...

201
00:12:34.292 --> 00:12:35.691
Okay.

202
00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.462
That's weird.
Uh...

203
00:12:39.229 --> 00:12:40.696
Babe.
something is wrong.

204
00:12:40.765 --> 00:12:42.531
You don't know that.

205
00:12:45.603 --> 00:12:46.835
Hi.

206
00:12:46.904 --> 00:12:48.938
Sheriff:
Sorry to bother y'all.

207
00:12:49.007 --> 00:12:51.339
Uh. we're just
canvassing the area

208
00:12:51.408 --> 00:12:55.143
to see if you noticed
anything unusual last night?

209
00:12:55.212 --> 00:12:57.673
Oh. uh. we weren't here
last night.

210
00:12:57.742 --> 00:12:59.909
We got here today.
We're renting.

211
00:12:59.978 --> 00:13:01.483
Yeah. we checked in early
and went for a hike

212
00:13:01.552 --> 00:13:03.285
so they could
finish cleaning the place.

213
00:13:03.354 --> 00:13:05.921
Did you hear
or see anything unusual

214
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:08.056
while you're staying here.
anything suspicious?

215
00:13:08.125 --> 00:13:11.187
No. We didn't hear or see
anything suspicious.

216
00:13:11.256 --> 00:13:12.188
did we. Alex?

217
00:13:12.257 --> 00:13:13.298
No.

218
00:13:15.066 --> 00:13:17.265
Is something wrong?

219
00:13:17.334 --> 00:13:21.737
Well. um. we don't wanna
freak out the tourists.

220
00:13:21.806 --> 00:13:23.838
Tourists are
our lifeblood.

221
00:13:23.907 --> 00:13:27.309
But we found a body on the other
side of the mountain last night.

222
00:13:27.378 --> 00:13:28.847
Oh. my God.

223
00:13:30.815 --> 00:13:32.080
Is it a hiker
or something?

224
00:13:32.149 --> 00:13:33.748
How -- How did
they die?

225
00:13:33.817 --> 00:13:35.416
The coroner's
doing a report.

226
00:13:35.485 --> 00:13:36.985
That's all we can say
right now.

227
00:13:37.054 --> 00:13:39.688
But she didn't beat
and strangle herself.

228
00:13:39.757 --> 00:13:40.889
Holy shit!

229
00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.357
Oh. my God.
Babe.

230
00:13:42.426 --> 00:13:44.627
Wait a minute.

231
00:13:44.696 --> 00:13:46.795
May I come in?

232
00:13:46.864 --> 00:13:49.699
Uh...yeah.
that's fine.

233
00:13:49.768 --> 00:13:51.436
Yeah. come on in.

234
00:14:00.378 --> 00:14:03.011
Where'd you get
the log?

235
00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:07.215
Uh. just down the road
a little bit.

236
00:14:07.284 --> 00:14:10.218
From the tree with the rocks
around it in a circle?

237
00:14:10.287 --> 00:14:12.387
Yeah. I think so.
Why?

238
00:14:12.456 --> 00:14:14.490
Is there
something wrong?

239
00:14:14.559 --> 00:14:17.058
That's a hanging tree.

240
00:14:17.127 --> 00:14:19.395
They used to
hang slaves on it.

241
00:14:19.464 --> 00:14:20.663
Ohh.
Oh. my God!

242
00:14:20.732 --> 00:14:21.897
I-I-I didn't know.

243
00:14:21.966 --> 00:14:23.999
I-I mean. how was I
supposed to know?

244
00:14:24.068 --> 00:14:25.533
It just was
a-a cool-looking log.

245
00:14:25.602 --> 00:14:27.068
And the branch I cut it off
was dead. so...

246
00:14:27.137 --> 00:14:29.064
Didn't you see
the plaque?

247
00:14:29.133 --> 00:14:31.340
No. I didn't see the plaque.
Did you see a plaque?

248
00:14:31.409 --> 00:14:33.108
We -- We saw no plaques.
Sheriff.

249
00:14:33.177 --> 00:14:36.005
Oh. Diane took down
that plaque. Sheriff.

250
00:14:36.074 --> 00:14:37.913
Yeah. she rents that place out
for weddings down there.

251
00:14:37.982 --> 00:14:39.782
They don't want
to read about slavery.

252
00:14:39.851 --> 00:14:40.916
She took down
the plaque?

253
00:14:40.985 --> 00:14:43.551
Yes.
'Cause of weddings.

254
00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:47.055
Well. it's her land. but she
shouldn't have done that.

255
00:14:47.124 --> 00:14:49.224
I'm going to have to
talk to her about that.

256
00:14:49.293 --> 00:14:52.961
Did we do something wrong?
'Cause we had no idea.

257
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.763
That's also
a very sacred tree

258
00:14:55.832 --> 00:14:58.366
to the tribe that used to
live around these parts.

259
00:14:58.435 --> 00:15:00.869
Yeah. they considered it
a demon tree.

260
00:15:00.938 --> 00:15:02.772
They would
never touch it.

261
00:15:02.841 --> 00:15:05.474
Supposedly
it fed on fear

262
00:15:05.543 --> 00:15:08.311
and all the iron from all the
blood spilling underneath it.

263
00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:09.706
Hollis.

264
00:15:09.775 --> 00:15:11.346
I'm researching
for a Ghost Walk.

265
00:15:11.415 --> 00:15:15.684
Well. these nice people don't
need your ghost walk spiel.

266
00:15:15.753 --> 00:15:17.422
They're on vacation.

267
00:15:19.489 --> 00:15:21.393
Can I get
a glass of water?

268
00:15:23.928 --> 00:15:26.498
Yeah. of course.
Of course.

269
00:15:37.541 --> 00:15:39.708
Now. I'm not
the superstitious type.

270
00:15:39.777 --> 00:15:41.676
Yeah.

271
00:15:41.745 --> 00:15:45.147
But I've heard enough
of this weird crap around here.

272
00:15:45.216 --> 00:15:46.547
Some of these people think
this mountain's

273
00:15:46.616 --> 00:15:51.053
like some kinda
hillbilly Bermuda Triangle.

274
00:15:51.122 --> 00:15:53.489
Yeah.
Maybe it's from the tree.

275
00:15:53.558 --> 00:15:54.857
Maybe it's not.

276
00:15:54.926 --> 00:15:57.760
It is.

277
00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:59.498
Well. we won't
do it again.

278
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.462
Oh.

279
00:16:05.531 --> 00:16:08.103
Okay.
Um...

280
00:16:08.172 --> 00:16:11.768
I wouldn't
burn that log again.

281
00:16:11.837 --> 00:16:14.643
Tomorrow I'd bury it
respectfully.

282
00:16:14.712 --> 00:16:16.278
Don't touch it.

283
00:16:16.347 --> 00:16:18.814
Use some cloth
to carry it out.

284
00:16:18.883 --> 00:16:20.848
Maybe even
say a prayer.

285
00:16:20.917 --> 00:16:23.017
That's what I'd recommend.
Yeah. okay. no. absolutely.

286
00:16:23.086 --> 00:16:25.448
We'll do whatever's necessary.
We're so sorry.
Yeah. Yeah.

287
00:16:25.517 --> 00:16:28.924
We'll -- We'll say our prayers
and everything. yeah.
Yeah.

288
00:16:28.993 --> 00:16:30.292
Y'all two
on vacation?

289
00:16:30.361 --> 00:16:32.393
Uh. we were. yes.
a very nice vacation

290
00:16:32.462 --> 00:16:33.761
until both of you guys
showed up

291
00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:37.799
talking about dead bodies
and demon trees.

292
00:16:37.868 --> 00:16:40.068
Well. wait until he tells you
about the aliens.

293
00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.106
I-I'm sorry.

294
00:16:44.175 --> 00:16:47.108
Y-You two seem like
a very nice couple.

295
00:16:47.177 --> 00:16:50.211
And I-I want you
to enjoy yourselves.

296
00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.749
But I just like
to be cautious.

297
00:16:53.818 --> 00:16:55.346
The Sheriff's
very cautious.

298
00:16:55.415 --> 00:16:58.087
Sure.

299
00:16:58.156 --> 00:16:59.722
That's a nice camera.

300
00:16:59.791 --> 00:17:01.089
Uh. yeah.
thank you.

301
00:17:01.158 --> 00:17:02.624
Yeah.
What do you call this thing?

302
00:17:02.693 --> 00:17:04.893
Like a...

303
00:17:04.962 --> 00:17:06.161
DSLR?

304
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:08.130
Uh close.

305
00:17:08.199 --> 00:17:09.364
It's an AF100.

306
00:17:09.433 --> 00:17:11.499
It's probably overkill
for my purposes.

307
00:17:11.568 --> 00:17:14.469
but. uh. you know.
I just like stuff to look nice.

308
00:17:14.538 --> 00:17:15.837
You know. like.
during the holidays

309
00:17:15.906 --> 00:17:18.034
where people that don't
have a fireplace.

310
00:17:18.103 --> 00:17:19.842
they like to put up
a video of a fire?

311
00:17:19.911 --> 00:17:21.109
Yeah.

312
00:17:21.178 --> 00:17:23.311
I make those.
I put them on YouTube.

313
00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:24.579
Oh. no kidding?

314
00:17:24.648 --> 00:17:26.181
Hey. we use that
down at the station.

315
00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:28.249
Yeah.
It's got
Christmas music on.

316
00:17:28.318 --> 00:17:30.586
Yeah. my daughter
uses one. too. to study.

317
00:17:30.655 --> 00:17:33.192
She's got ADHD.

318
00:17:34.358 --> 00:17:36.324
Well. uh. I did one
last year in Bali.

319
00:17:36.393 --> 00:17:39.562
It was a. uh --
like a beach bonfire situation.

320
00:17:39.631 --> 00:17:41.029
Pretty cool.

321
00:17:41.098 --> 00:17:45.300
Huh. Is that like a job
or just a hobby?

322
00:17:45.369 --> 00:17:48.070
Um. I make
some money at it. yeah.

323
00:17:48.139 --> 00:17:51.406
He has at least
a million views.

324
00:17:51.475 --> 00:17:53.675
I'm in the wrong business.

325
00:17:53.744 --> 00:17:58.380
Well. If you recorded that log.
I would definitely erase it.

326
00:17:58.449 --> 00:18:01.116
Anyway. we'll let
you nice people

327
00:18:01.185 --> 00:18:03.146
get back to your vacation.

328
00:18:03.215 --> 00:18:07.355
But if you need anything.
anything at all.

329
00:18:07.424 --> 00:18:09.892
here's my card.

330
00:18:09.961 --> 00:18:11.526
Absolutely.

331
00:18:11.595 --> 00:18:15.497
Yep. we will be
in touch.

332
00:18:15.566 --> 00:18:18.333
Have a good night.
Sheriff.

333
00:18:18.402 --> 00:18:21.937
Deputy.
Ohh. watch your step.

334
00:18:22.006 --> 00:18:23.706
Appreciate
all you guys do.

335
00:18:23.775 --> 00:18:24.739
Protecting and serving.

336
00:18:24.808 --> 00:18:27.009
Your tax dollars at work.
by the way.

337
00:18:27.078 --> 00:18:28.776
Like. what was that?

338
00:18:28.845 --> 00:18:31.446
That is so disturbing.
Yeah. I know!

339
00:18:31.515 --> 00:18:33.582
It's like I hate it when
these men in positions of power

340
00:18:33.651 --> 00:18:37.252
just believe all this.
like. superstitious shit.

341
00:18:37.321 --> 00:18:39.387
I'm talking about
the killing.

342
00:18:39.456 --> 00:18:40.722
There's a killer
on the loose. Alex!

343
00:18:40.791 --> 00:18:43.358
Right. yes. I know about.
yeah. that.

344
00:18:43.427 --> 00:18:44.659
But. you know. honestly.

345
00:18:44.728 --> 00:18:47.362
I wouldn't really worry
about that. babe.

346
00:18:47.431 --> 00:18:50.332
I mean. most murders
are family disputes.

347
00:18:50.401 --> 00:18:52.067
statistically speaking.

348
00:18:52.136 --> 00:18:54.069
Right?

349
00:18:54.138 --> 00:18:55.770
And if it is
a serial killer.

350
00:18:55.839 --> 00:18:58.539
which. despite all
the true-crime documentaries

351
00:18:58.608 --> 00:19:02.577
would have you believe.
is super. super rare.

352
00:19:02.646 --> 00:19:06.514
he's probably
very far away from here.

353
00:19:06.583 --> 00:19:08.483
Babe. it can't
be that rare.

354
00:19:08.552 --> 00:19:10.452
There's many true-crime
shows about them.

355
00:19:10.521 --> 00:19:12.354
You really need to stop watching
that shit before you go to bed

356
00:19:12.423 --> 00:19:13.588
with as anxious
as you are.

357
00:19:13.657 --> 00:19:16.191
Ugh. God.
I have to be prepared. Alex.

358
00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:17.693
Always be prepared.
right.

359
00:19:17.762 --> 00:19:20.028
my little --
my little Boy Scout.

360
00:19:20.097 --> 00:19:21.766
Come here.

361
00:19:24.835 --> 00:19:30.706
What do you say
I relight that log?

362
00:19:30.775 --> 00:19:32.273
Or -- Or --

363
00:19:32.342 --> 00:19:35.271
Or pick
a different one?

364
00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:38.479
The sheriff said don't.
The sheriff said don't?

365
00:19:38.548 --> 00:19:41.377
The sheriff said don't. Alex.
Okay. alright. listen.
I'm going to ask you something.

366
00:19:41.446 --> 00:19:44.853
I'm going to ask you something.
Be honest with me.

367
00:19:44.922 --> 00:19:48.757
Do you believe that
that log is cursed?

368
00:19:48.826 --> 00:19:50.325
Hmm?

369
00:19:50.394 --> 00:19:52.260
I don't know what to believe.
Okay?

370
00:19:52.329 --> 00:19:54.795
I-I-I think the sheriff
might be watching.

371
00:19:54.864 --> 00:19:57.599
He might see the smoke.
Okay. alright.
Well. fuck me. then right?

372
00:19:57.668 --> 00:20:01.269
'Cause I just wanted
to light a fire in a cabin

373
00:20:01.338 --> 00:20:04.640
with my girlfriend and propose
to her on a bearskin rug.

374
00:20:04.709 --> 00:20:06.411
Yeah.

375
00:20:12.516 --> 00:20:14.216
You never answered me.
by the way.

376
00:20:14.285 --> 00:20:15.955
Answered what?

377
00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:20.622
"Will you marry me?"

378
00:20:20.691 --> 00:20:22.524
Can we -- Can we just talk
about that later?

379
00:20:22.593 --> 00:20:25.360
What does that mean?
What does that mean. Zo?

380
00:20:25.429 --> 00:20:26.961
I'm just --
I mean. like. do you want to?

381
00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:28.463
Do you not want to?
Do you want to think about it?

382
00:20:28.532 --> 00:20:30.265
Babe. I'm just freaked out
right now!

383
00:20:30.334 --> 00:20:31.566
You're freaked out
by who?

384
00:20:31.635 --> 00:20:34.035
By -- By Sheriff Bumfuck
and Deputy Cletus?

385
00:20:34.104 --> 00:20:36.872
What?
What? Are you --
A-Are you mad?

386
00:20:36.941 --> 00:20:40.041
No. No. No.

387
00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:41.346
No.

388
00:20:43.214 --> 00:20:44.883
I'm not.

389
00:20:48.086 --> 00:20:50.452
Babe.
Yeah?

390
00:20:50.521 --> 00:20:53.656
I love you and I want
to marry you.

391
00:20:53.725 --> 00:20:55.891
I do.
but I'm just scared.

392
00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.359
Okay. Okay.
Okay.

393
00:20:57.428 --> 00:20:59.761
I'm -- I'm fucking scared
right now.
Look. I-I'm scared. too!

394
00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:01.997
It's a huge step.
I know that.

395
00:21:02.066 --> 00:21:03.535
I-I-I know.

396
00:21:05.702 --> 00:21:07.836
Alex. no!
It's -- It's not that.

397
00:21:07.905 --> 00:21:10.939
Okay? You're -- You're always
so just happy-go-lucky.

398
00:21:11.008 --> 00:21:12.540
And -- And I have my shit.

399
00:21:12.609 --> 00:21:14.675
What if it gets worse.
huh?

400
00:21:14.744 --> 00:21:17.077
What if it gets worse
like my mom?

401
00:21:17.146 --> 00:21:19.648
What if I grind you down
the way my mom did my dad?
Okay. you're not --
you're not like your mom.

402
00:21:19.717 --> 00:21:22.750
You're not like your mother!
You're nothing like your mother.

403
00:21:22.819 --> 00:21:25.220
You're not!
And I'm not your dad. Zoe.

404
00:21:25.289 --> 00:21:27.089
I'm not.

405
00:21:27.158 --> 00:21:28.652
Look at me.

406
00:21:28.721 --> 00:21:29.691
Look at me.

407
00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.730
You're not going to
grind me down.

408
00:21:33.697 --> 00:21:37.066
You might --
You might polish me. huh?

409
00:21:37.135 --> 00:21:39.434
Polish each other.

410
00:21:39.503 --> 00:21:42.371
Like -- Like
little diamonds.

411
00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.671
Don't you --
Don't you just feel

412
00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:46.541
like you should be
with someone happier?

413
00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:49.244
No. No. No.
Wouldn't that make you happy.
to be with someone happier?

414
00:21:49.313 --> 00:21:52.014
Huh?
I want -- I want you.

415
00:21:52.083 --> 00:21:56.888
You big stupid. dumb.
dumb idiot.

416
00:21:59.357 --> 00:22:01.090
You always know
the right things to say.

417
00:22:01.159 --> 00:22:02.786
But I --
But. but. but.

418
00:22:02.855 --> 00:22:05.927
I feel cursed.

419
00:22:05.996 --> 00:22:08.396
Yes. like our friend the log
in the fireplace.

420
00:22:08.465 --> 00:22:10.866
Don't joke.
Don't joke about that.

421
00:22:10.935 --> 00:22:12.935
Okay.

422
00:22:13.004 --> 00:22:15.670
It's -- It's like a --
It's like. um --

423
00:22:15.739 --> 00:22:17.072
It's like
a sense of doom.

424
00:22:17.141 --> 00:22:19.541
Like I'm always waiting
for the other shoe to drop.

425
00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:20.675
You know. like --
like. what if --

426
00:22:20.744 --> 00:22:21.944
what if we're
at a certain place

427
00:22:22.013 --> 00:22:23.378
at a certain location
at a certain time

428
00:22:23.447 --> 00:22:25.981
and then a tree
happens to fall on us

429
00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:27.249
and had you not
been married to me.

430
00:22:27.318 --> 00:22:28.449
none of this
would have happened.

431
00:22:28.518 --> 00:22:30.552
You would have
never died. Alex.

432
00:22:30.621 --> 00:22:33.088
Zoe. that is so completely
off the rails.

433
00:22:33.157 --> 00:22:35.089
I-I-I'm going to ask you
something right now

434
00:22:35.158 --> 00:22:39.761
and I really. really don't
want you to get angry at me.

435
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:42.263
Can you promise to try?
I-I'm going to try.

436
00:22:42.332 --> 00:22:45.434
But you prefaced it
really strongly.
Do you think...

437
00:22:45.503 --> 00:22:48.536
that maybe...

438
00:22:48.605 --> 00:22:50.542
we should up
your medication?

439
00:23:05.989 --> 00:23:08.656
It's not about my meds.
Alex!
Okay. Alright.

440
00:23:08.725 --> 00:23:09.858
It's not about my meds.
Okay.

441
00:23:09.927 --> 00:23:11.426
This --
This is who I am.

442
00:23:11.495 --> 00:23:12.960
Alright.
Look. I'm sorry.

443
00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:14.730
A lot of fucked-up shit
has happened to you

444
00:23:14.799 --> 00:23:16.464
in your life. babe.

445
00:23:16.533 --> 00:23:18.333
And I-I-I just want you
to be happy.

446
00:23:18.402 --> 00:23:20.072
Okay?
That's all I want.

447
00:23:23.273 --> 00:23:24.944
That's all I want.

448
00:23:30.348 --> 00:23:32.084
This isn't just Willow.

449
00:23:34.185 --> 00:23:35.078
Okay.

450
00:23:35.147 --> 00:23:37.752
The planet is dying.
Alex.

451
00:23:37.821 --> 00:23:40.789
And I'm supposed to what?
Go pick out china patterns?

452
00:23:40.858 --> 00:23:42.757
"Oh. my God!
That's so pretty!

453
00:23:42.826 --> 00:23:45.965
Do you have it in lilac?
Do you have it in blue?"

454
00:23:48.232 --> 00:23:52.167
How am I supposed to raise
a child in this hellhole?

455
00:23:52.236 --> 00:23:54.970
Okay.
Alright.

456
00:23:55.039 --> 00:23:57.004
How do you -- How do you
even plan for the future

457
00:23:57.073 --> 00:23:58.606
when there is none?
Alright. listen. listen!
Everything --

458
00:23:58.675 --> 00:24:00.609
How do you plan for the future
when there isn't one?

459
00:24:00.678 --> 00:24:02.310
Every era of time --
Nothing matters!

460
00:24:02.379 --> 00:24:05.447
Every era of time seems shitty
when you're in it. okay?

461
00:24:05.516 --> 00:24:06.914
That's just an objective
point of fact.

462
00:24:06.983 --> 00:24:09.917
Everybody believes that
about their era. right?

463
00:24:09.986 --> 00:24:12.287
Okay. just imagine. like.
living in World War I or II.

464
00:24:12.356 --> 00:24:14.088
Oh! Ooh!
Pick an era!

465
00:24:14.157 --> 00:24:16.291
As a black woman
during the Civil War.
Oh! As a black woman. huh?

466
00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.926
Don't -- Don't do that.
Don't do that!
Okay.

467
00:24:17.995 --> 00:24:20.095
I'm making a very cogent point
right now. okay.

468
00:24:20.164 --> 00:24:22.463
Ohh. Cogent.

469
00:24:22.532 --> 00:24:23.964
I just think
that we are living

470
00:24:24.033 --> 00:24:27.469
at a pretty good little pocket
of time in history.

471
00:24:27.538 --> 00:24:31.640
You know. uh.
comparatively speaking.

472
00:24:31.709 --> 00:24:35.377
I guess my point is that
there's always going to be

473
00:24:35.446 --> 00:24:36.845
shitty aspects
of life. babe.

474
00:24:36.914 --> 00:24:38.480
No matter what era
you live in.

475
00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:41.549
And you just gotta --
you just gotta find the good.

476
00:24:41.618 --> 00:24:43.719
You know. you got to
lean into the good.

477
00:24:43.788 --> 00:24:45.686
Babe. this time
is different.

478
00:24:45.755 --> 00:24:50.358
The world is literally going
to hell in a handbasket.

479
00:24:50.427 --> 00:24:52.097
I think you mean
figuratively.

480
00:24:54.298 --> 00:24:58.167
Okay. yeah.
Yeah. maybe you're right.

481
00:24:58.236 --> 00:24:59.234
But you know what?

482
00:24:59.303 --> 00:25:01.169
If it going to hell
in a handbasket.

483
00:25:01.238 --> 00:25:04.006
I want to be in
that handbasket with you.

484
00:25:04.075 --> 00:25:05.641
Me and you.
In a handbasket.

485
00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:07.309
Just -- Just two guys.

486
00:25:07.378 --> 00:25:11.046
plummeting to the depths of hell
in a -- in a handbasket. right?

487
00:25:11.115 --> 00:25:12.580
Assuming we can find one.
I guess.

488
00:25:12.649 --> 00:25:13.948
big enough for --
for two of us.

489
00:25:14.017 --> 00:25:15.117
Although if the world
is in a handbasket.

490
00:25:15.186 --> 00:25:16.685
I guess
we would also be...

491
00:25:16.754 --> 00:25:18.654
Do you want to go
in the hot tub?

492
00:25:21.592 --> 00:25:24.725
You were just terrified of
a killer stalking in the woods.

493
00:25:24.794 --> 00:25:25.827
and now you want to go
in a hot tub?

494
00:25:25.896 --> 00:25:27.895
I never said
I was consistent.

495
00:25:31.603 --> 00:25:32.701
Do you hear that?

496
00:25:35.805 --> 00:25:37.339
Oh. my God.
it's the killer.

497
00:25:37.408 --> 00:25:38.440
They have the code.
babe.

498
00:25:38.509 --> 00:25:40.612
Uh. just -- just relax.

499
00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:42.812
Whoa. Hello?

500
00:25:42.881 --> 00:25:45.448
-Hi.
-Hey.

501
00:25:45.517 --> 00:25:46.847
What can I do for you?

502
00:25:46.916 --> 00:25:49.451
We're renting the place?
Who are you guys?

503
00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.286
Huh.
Um...

504
00:25:51.355 --> 00:25:53.622
I'm sorry. actually.
we're renting the place.

505
00:25:53.691 --> 00:25:55.991
The reservation's on my phone.
Hold on.

506
00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:57.760
Okay. well. I've got
the reservation on mine.

507
00:25:57.829 --> 00:25:59.061
Did you guys
go through Airbnb?

508
00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:00.556
No.
Mountain Getaways.

509
00:26:00.625 --> 00:26:01.762
Could I actually
come in and pee?

510
00:26:01.831 --> 00:26:03.131
I've just been
holding it for...

511
00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.532
Yes! You can!
'Cause we rented the place.

512
00:26:04.601 --> 00:26:06.033
-Okay. Excuse me.
-No. no.

513
00:26:06.102 --> 00:26:08.069
-Yeah. Everyone in! Yeah.
-No! No. no. no. no. No. No.

514
00:26:08.138 --> 00:26:09.804
Can you guys just go --
just go back outside. please?
We rented the place.

515
00:26:09.873 --> 00:26:11.172
-Yeah. we did. See. Here.
-No. I'm so sorry.

516
00:26:11.241 --> 00:26:12.340
-Oh. crackers. Fuck it.
-Can I see yours?

517
00:26:12.409 --> 00:26:15.210
-Yeah. yeah.
-Okay.

518
00:26:15.279 --> 00:26:16.706
Hey. uh. babe.

519
00:26:16.775 --> 00:26:18.513
Do you think that we should
have people inside

520
00:26:18.582 --> 00:26:20.449
while there's a killer
on the loose?

521
00:26:20.518 --> 00:26:22.184
Killer?
Tell me more!

522
00:26:22.253 --> 00:26:24.185
Looks like
we're double booked.
Yeah.

523
00:26:24.254 --> 00:26:25.686
We each booked on
different websites

524
00:26:25.755 --> 00:26:27.390
and it didn't reconcile
or something.

525
00:26:27.459 --> 00:26:29.524
Okay. um...

526
00:26:29.593 --> 00:26:30.792
Okay. I'll just
call the owner.

527
00:26:30.861 --> 00:26:32.895
Oh. yeah.
I'll call the owner. too.

528
00:26:32.964 --> 00:26:34.696
It's a race.

529
00:26:34.765 --> 00:26:36.632
We all took these edibles
designed to hit

530
00:26:36.701 --> 00:26:38.033
as soon as we got here.

531
00:26:38.102 --> 00:26:41.206
so I don't see us driving
anywhere tonight.

532
00:26:44.075 --> 00:26:45.975
Seriously?
Babe. it's gonna be fine.

533
00:26:46.044 --> 00:26:47.943
I'm sure they've got. like.
tons of properties.

534
00:26:49.848 --> 00:26:51.446
Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh.
Like --

535
00:26:51.515 --> 00:26:53.649
Shh!

536
00:26:53.718 --> 00:26:55.951
You guy's hear that?

537
00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:59.287
It's a phone ringing.

538
00:26:59.356 --> 00:27:00.856
It's not mine.

539
00:27:03.861 --> 00:27:05.264
I hear it.

540
00:27:07.297 --> 00:27:08.667
Where is it?

541
00:27:14.338 --> 00:27:16.705
It's a cellphone
underneath the couch.

542
00:27:16.774 --> 00:27:18.173
Babe. this is so fucked.
Huh.

543
00:27:18.242 --> 00:27:19.709
This has to be
the landlady's phone.

544
00:27:19.778 --> 00:27:21.309
Okay.
Okay. yeah.

545
00:27:21.378 --> 00:27:25.441
Um. she probably just left it on
accident when she was cleaning.

546
00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:26.782
Who leaves their
cellphone behind?

547
00:27:26.851 --> 00:27:28.350
Babe.
I'm getting scared.

548
00:27:28.419 --> 00:27:30.580
I think that we should go ahead
and call the sheriff.

549
00:27:30.649 --> 00:27:32.688
You have his card.
Oh. fuck. that guy?

550
00:27:32.757 --> 00:27:35.223
He sucks.

551
00:27:35.292 --> 00:27:37.292
Alright. fine.
I'll just get the card.

552
00:27:37.361 --> 00:27:39.728
You just happen to have
the sheriff's card?

553
00:27:39.797 --> 00:27:40.896
Yeah. that's suspect.

554
00:27:40.965 --> 00:27:42.463
Okay. it's not as weird
as it sounds.

555
00:27:42.532 --> 00:27:43.698
He was up here
earlier.

556
00:27:43.767 --> 00:27:45.935
He's investigating a murder
or something.

557
00:27:46.004 --> 00:27:48.536
Whoa.
Wait. that's perfect.

558
00:27:48.605 --> 00:27:51.106
We do
a murder podcast.

559
00:27:51.175 --> 00:27:54.944
Our podcast is called "There's
a Podcast in the House"!

560
00:27:57.081 --> 00:27:59.649
Have you heard
of our podcast?

561
00:27:59.718 --> 00:28:01.016
Have you heard
of our podcast?

562
00:28:01.085 --> 00:28:03.118
I haven't heard
of your podcast!
Okay.

563
00:28:03.187 --> 00:28:04.885
We're still trying
to find our audience.

564
00:28:04.954 --> 00:28:06.654
But you should listen to
some of the newer episodes.

565
00:28:06.723 --> 00:28:09.392
'cause some of the older ones.
like. aren't so good. but --

566
00:28:09.461 --> 00:28:10.486
Babe. Babe.

567
00:28:10.555 --> 00:28:12.627
Hey. this is
a nice camera.

568
00:28:12.696 --> 00:28:15.596
What are you guys filming.
a porno or something?

569
00:28:15.665 --> 00:28:20.005
No. Alex shoots yule log videos
as a side hustle.

570
00:28:20.872 --> 00:28:22.337
If I left my phone behind.

571
00:28:22.406 --> 00:28:25.240
I think that I would try
and go and find it immediately.

572
00:28:25.309 --> 00:28:26.869
Why didn't...

573
00:28:26.938 --> 00:28:28.443
Why didn't the landlady go
and try to get her phone?

574
00:28:28.512 --> 00:28:31.541
Yo. yo. do you do that for money
or. like. as a hobby?

575
00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:33.516
Because that's
a genius idea.

576
00:28:33.585 --> 00:28:35.216
So easy.

577
00:28:35.285 --> 00:28:37.085
God. That's so not important
right now.

578
00:28:37.154 --> 00:28:38.720
Well. it started out
as a hobby. actually.

579
00:28:38.789 --> 00:28:40.722
but then I. uh.
fell into monetizing it.

580
00:28:40.791 --> 00:28:41.990
Actually.
last year. I. uh.

581
00:28:42.059 --> 00:28:44.126
shot a bonfire
on the beach in Bali.

582
00:28:44.195 --> 00:28:46.061
It's up to like
10 million views or something.

583
00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:48.096
Okay! That's really cool.
Bali. man.

584
00:28:48.165 --> 00:28:49.331
Hey!
Hey. hey. hey. hey.

585
00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.100
Could you please
not do that right now?

586
00:28:51.169 --> 00:28:52.701
The sheriff said
not to do that.

587
00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:54.135
Okay. whoa.
Okay.

588
00:28:54.204 --> 00:28:57.306
What. is it. like. illegal
to burn logs or something?

589
00:29:00.872 --> 00:29:03.645
We accidentally got it
from a cursed tree.

590
00:29:03.714 --> 00:29:05.581
So is that why
it won't light?

591
00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:07.148
Oh!
Checks out.

592
00:29:07.217 --> 00:29:09.851
No. I-I totally feel the cursed
energy coming from it.

593
00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.220
You feel the edible
hitting. Henry.

594
00:29:12.289 --> 00:29:14.590
It was used to hang
enslaved people.

595
00:29:14.659 --> 00:29:16.225
Whoa.
We just --

596
00:29:16.294 --> 00:29:18.494
The hanging tree.
We just read about it.

597
00:29:18.563 --> 00:29:20.730
Totally!

598
00:29:20.799 --> 00:29:22.865
Is that --
Ah. fuck!

599
00:29:22.934 --> 00:29:24.266
Aw. babe!

600
00:29:24.335 --> 00:29:25.767
It's a splinter!
Did you hurt yourself?

601
00:29:25.836 --> 00:29:28.003
Aw. I'm so sorry.
Oof.

602
00:29:28.072 --> 00:29:29.938
We actually just did
this episode recently

603
00:29:30.007 --> 00:29:32.174
about aliens
in lynching photos.

604
00:29:32.243 --> 00:29:33.641
Yeah.
You've seen
the famous photo. right?

605
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:35.644
It was. like.
essentially viral.

606
00:29:35.713 --> 00:29:38.313
No. I-I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

607
00:29:38.382 --> 00:29:42.417
It's a super-famous photo
of a lynching with a huge crowd.

608
00:29:42.486 --> 00:29:44.720
And there's one dude
in the crowd that looks weird.

609
00:29:44.789 --> 00:29:46.955
He has
a face mask on.

610
00:29:47.024 --> 00:29:48.851
He's an alien
wearing a mask.

611
00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:52.193
And it's got a chunky
wristwatch. and -- Okay.

612
00:29:52.262 --> 00:29:54.129
Uh. wristwatches
weren't invented back then!

613
00:29:54.198 --> 00:29:55.230
Yeah. no.
for sure. for sure.

614
00:29:55.299 --> 00:29:57.098
Like. totally plausible.
Yeah.

615
00:29:57.167 --> 00:29:58.734
Like. if I was an alien
that had. like.

616
00:29:58.803 --> 00:30:00.302
super-advanced technology

617
00:30:00.371 --> 00:30:02.303
and could travel like millions
of light-years to get to earth.

618
00:30:02.372 --> 00:30:05.407
I just wouldn't even bother
with a convincing mask.

619
00:30:05.476 --> 00:30:08.010
Hey. Alex. you're supposed to be
on the phone with the sheriff.

620
00:30:08.079 --> 00:30:09.211
I'm on hold. babe.

621
00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:12.448
I will find
a picture.

622
00:30:12.517 --> 00:30:13.616
Oh. there it is.

623
00:30:13.685 --> 00:30:15.785
Decide for yourself.

624
00:30:15.854 --> 00:30:17.819
Whoa.
Right. it's freaky.

625
00:30:17.888 --> 00:30:20.389
Actually. yeah.
that's. uh -- yeah.

626
00:30:20.458 --> 00:30:21.423
Yeah. I take it back.

627
00:30:21.492 --> 00:30:22.924
This is actually
a super-compelling photo.

628
00:30:22.993 --> 00:30:25.160
Babe. it's like this. uh.
really grainy photo

629
00:30:25.229 --> 00:30:27.162
of. uh. like.
a blurry guy.

630
00:30:27.231 --> 00:30:29.665
Yeah.
Um. maybe he
just looks like a human

631
00:30:29.734 --> 00:30:31.900
that's a little bit
deformed.

632
00:30:31.969 --> 00:30:34.235
So. good job. man.
Very. very sensitive.

633
00:30:34.304 --> 00:30:35.470
Honestly. the most fucked-up
part of that photo

634
00:30:35.539 --> 00:30:37.005
is all the people
just standing around

635
00:30:37.074 --> 00:30:38.206
yucking it up
while somebody's --

636
00:30:38.275 --> 00:30:40.709
Hey. Sheriff.
Hi. This is Alex.

637
00:30:40.778 --> 00:30:41.877
Uh. you came by
the cabin earlier.

638
00:30:41.946 --> 00:30:43.578
Did you want to see
the photo?

639
00:30:43.647 --> 00:30:45.146
No. I don't want to see
your photo.

640
00:30:45.215 --> 00:30:46.715
Just -- Just stop.
Okay.

641
00:30:46.784 --> 00:30:49.151
Okay.
Well. you guys know
that this mountain

642
00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:51.921
was the site of a string
of alien abductions

643
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:54.457
and lynchings
in the 1950s. right?

644
00:30:54.526 --> 00:30:55.390
She doesn't care.

645
00:30:55.459 --> 00:30:57.125
Yeah. but. like.
Esther Dickens.

646
00:30:57.194 --> 00:30:59.294
The most famous case
is Esther Dickens.

647
00:30:59.363 --> 00:31:00.729
Do you know
who Esther Dickens is?

648
00:31:00.798 --> 00:31:02.097
Esther. man.
Esther Dickens!

649
00:31:02.166 --> 00:31:04.366
Like. I'm going to be
interviewing her grandkids.

650
00:31:04.435 --> 00:31:06.969
Yeah. for the podcast.
For the podcast!

651
00:31:07.038 --> 00:31:10.806
Enough.
Enough about your podcast.

652
00:31:10.875 --> 00:31:11.840
Whoa.
Okay.

653
00:31:11.909 --> 00:31:13.876
The landlady
is missing!

654
00:31:13.945 --> 00:31:15.844
Well. that's
a pretty anti-climactic

655
00:31:15.913 --> 00:31:17.345
phone call I just had.

656
00:31:17.414 --> 00:31:19.915
Babe. what did he say?
Uh. not a whole lot.

657
00:31:19.984 --> 00:31:22.617
He said to. uh.
call back tomorrow

658
00:31:22.686 --> 00:31:24.854
if she doesn't show up
later for her phone.

659
00:31:24.923 --> 00:31:25.921
Tomorrow?
Yeah.

660
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:27.322
Tomorrow?
Okay.

661
00:31:27.391 --> 00:31:28.890
What kind of half-ass shit
is that?

662
00:31:28.959 --> 00:31:31.126
There is a killer
on the loose.
Babe. I know.

663
00:31:31.195 --> 00:31:32.661
What -- What do you
want me to say. man?

664
00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:35.230
This is -- This is small-town
mountain village life.

665
00:31:35.299 --> 00:31:36.631
You know?
You know what I mean?

666
00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.566
This is what happens
in these cities. right?

667
00:31:38.635 --> 00:31:40.768
All the smart. like.
upwardly mobile people.

668
00:31:40.837 --> 00:31:43.404
they move away because there's.
like. shitty jobs here.

669
00:31:43.473 --> 00:31:44.835
and the ones
who stick around.

670
00:31:44.904 --> 00:31:46.441
they're all just
superstitious idiots.

671
00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:48.343
They believe stuff like.
you know.

672
00:31:48.412 --> 00:31:50.212
the -- the weeping oak
or whatever.

673
00:31:50.281 --> 00:31:51.446
Just all this
superstitious shit.

674
00:31:51.515 --> 00:31:53.348
That sheriff
was a fucking caricature.

675
00:31:53.417 --> 00:31:54.950
And -- And this is it.
You know what I mean?

676
00:31:55.019 --> 00:31:56.051
This is --
This is what happens.

677
00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:58.921
Bang. bang.

678
00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:01.260
-Bang. bang. bang.
-Oh.

679
00:32:03.127 --> 00:32:04.527
Have fun. honey.

680
00:32:12.932 --> 00:32:14.898
Rosa. that is some
good cornbread!

681
00:32:14.967 --> 00:32:16.371
I'll tell you what.
some people say

682
00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:19.135
you shouldn't serve cornbread
with corn. but I like it.

683
00:32:19.204 --> 00:32:21.811
You could it with grits. too.
That's how much I like corn.

684
00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.612
I know that about you.
Isaac.

685
00:32:23.681 --> 00:32:24.847
Mm-hmm.

686
00:32:24.916 --> 00:32:26.916
I'm glad you like
my cornbread.

687
00:32:26.985 --> 00:32:28.351
Moist.

688
00:32:30.088 --> 00:32:35.357
Oh. Isaac. can I ask you
for a favor?

689
00:32:35.426 --> 00:32:36.992
Of course. Rosa.
What is it?

690
00:32:37.061 --> 00:32:40.963
You're going to
Luthor farm Saturday.

691
00:32:41.032 --> 00:32:42.498
Yes.

692
00:32:42.567 --> 00:32:43.999
I made a quilt.

693
00:32:44.068 --> 00:32:46.268
For William.

694
00:32:46.337 --> 00:32:47.802
It is getting cold.

695
00:32:47.871 --> 00:32:50.705
And it wasn't ready
when he was sold to Mr. Luthor.

696
00:32:50.774 --> 00:32:53.341
But. um. you know.
he's scared of thunder.

697
00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:58.547
So now he can look at this
and every day is blue skies.

698
00:32:58.616 --> 00:33:00.649
Yeah. he always was scared
of thunder. that boy.

699
00:33:00.718 --> 00:33:03.151
Mm-hmm.

700
00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:04.852
That's a nice blanket.
Rosa.

701
00:33:04.921 --> 00:33:07.122
I'd like to touch it but I don't
want to get corn on it.

702
00:33:07.191 --> 00:33:09.558
It looks soft.

703
00:33:09.627 --> 00:33:11.293
So will you
take it to him?

704
00:33:11.362 --> 00:33:14.199
And while you're there.
can you see how he's doing?

705
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.801
Hey. uh. Rosa.
will you do me a favor?

706
00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:22.137
Will you come sit next to me
here by the fire?

707
00:33:22.206 --> 00:33:24.476
Pull that chair up.
come sit next to me.

708
00:33:28.078 --> 00:33:29.748
What is it?

709
00:33:32.016 --> 00:33:34.583
Uh...

710
00:33:34.652 --> 00:33:35.650
Rosa. I --

711
00:33:35.719 --> 00:33:40.522
I couldn't sell William
to Mr. Luthor.

712
00:33:40.591 --> 00:33:42.090
Yes. sir.

713
00:33:42.159 --> 00:33:44.225
Now. I know we agreed
on Mr. Luthor.

714
00:33:44.294 --> 00:33:47.157
But when Daddy found out.

715
00:33:47.226 --> 00:33:50.165
he said I needed to auction him
to get the best price.

716
00:33:50.234 --> 00:33:52.868
He heard about it.

717
00:33:52.937 --> 00:33:54.169
Well.
Mr. Luthor didn't --

718
00:33:54.238 --> 00:33:55.670
Nah. No. Mr.. uh --

719
00:33:55.739 --> 00:33:58.707
Mr. Armfield ended up
making a higher offer.

720
00:33:58.776 --> 00:34:00.042
Mr. Armfield?

721
00:34:00.111 --> 00:34:02.010
Now. Rosa.
I-I got assurances

722
00:34:02.079 --> 00:34:04.213
that William
would be treated well.

723
00:34:04.282 --> 00:34:06.081
But Mr. Armfield.
he's a --

724
00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:07.782
Rosa.
I-I got assurances. now.

725
00:34:07.851 --> 00:34:10.151
I looked him in the eye.
No. you gave me your word.

726
00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:12.420
You gave me your word
he'd go to Mr. Luthor.
Rosa --

727
00:34:12.489 --> 00:34:14.456
Mr. Luthor. he's a nice man.
Now. now. if Daddy hadn't...

728
00:34:14.525 --> 00:34:15.856
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

729
00:34:15.925 --> 00:34:18.058
Thanks for letting us stay.
Oh. no problem.

730
00:34:18.127 --> 00:34:20.896
You don't have to thank them.
We're paying for it. too.

731
00:34:20.965 --> 00:34:22.163
We shouldn't have to
pay anything

732
00:34:22.232 --> 00:34:23.564
'cause the host fucked up.
right?

733
00:34:23.633 --> 00:34:25.134
We're going to figure it out
in the morning.

734
00:34:25.203 --> 00:34:27.068
So is there any room
off limits?

735
00:34:27.137 --> 00:34:28.871
Actually. our room
has our luggage in it.

736
00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:30.938
so it's pretty obvious.

737
00:34:31.007 --> 00:34:35.610
And there's a room upstairs.
And then there's this couch.

738
00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:37.579
Well. Beth and I will take
the room upstairs.

739
00:34:37.648 --> 00:34:39.080
Uh. Henry. you cool
with the couch?

740
00:34:39.149 --> 00:34:41.950
Huh? Sure. Wait.
What about the basement?

741
00:34:42.019 --> 00:34:43.385
Doesn't that have a bed?

742
00:34:43.454 --> 00:34:46.020
Uh. no. it's got rat traps
and cobwebs.

743
00:34:46.089 --> 00:34:49.591
Ohh. I thought it had bunks
and. like. a pool table.

744
00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:52.961
No. that was the other place.
This one has the hot tub.

745
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:55.831
Holly:
Speaking of which...

746
00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:57.600
let's hot tub!

747
00:34:57.669 --> 00:34:58.634
Okay!

748
00:34:58.703 --> 00:34:59.902
Whoo!

749
00:34:59.971 --> 00:35:01.403
Aw. yeah.

750
00:35:01.472 --> 00:35:02.804
You guys have fun.

751
00:35:02.873 --> 00:35:05.507
Um. excuse me?
You're not gonna come?

752
00:35:05.576 --> 00:35:08.443
Uh. no.
Hot tubs disgust me.
What?

753
00:35:08.512 --> 00:35:10.812
Okay.
You don't know
what's been in there.

754
00:35:10.881 --> 00:35:13.715
I'm going to take a shower
and wash off the road stank

755
00:35:13.784 --> 00:35:16.318
and Cheeto dust
before the edible hits.

756
00:35:16.387 --> 00:35:17.987
Henry:
You're such a grandma.

757
00:35:19.257 --> 00:35:21.222
Yeah. uh. don't smoke
in the house.

758
00:35:21.291 --> 00:35:22.524
We don't want to fuck
our deposit.

759
00:35:22.593 --> 00:35:25.127
Yeah.
Don't smoke in our house.

760
00:35:25.196 --> 00:35:28.831
Do you two
want to hot tub?

761
00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.633
Uh. why not?

762
00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:37.072
Actually. Alex and I
are going to go unpack.

763
00:35:37.141 --> 00:35:39.440
Okay. great.

764
00:35:39.509 --> 00:35:41.777
See you later.
Yeah.

765
00:35:41.846 --> 00:35:43.648
Let's go unpack. Alex.

766
00:36:15.712 --> 00:36:19.214
God! I can't be
the third wheel in this.

767
00:36:19.283 --> 00:36:21.683
Come on. Henry.
give us a "whoo"!

768
00:36:21.752 --> 00:36:23.919
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Come on. Whoo!

769
00:36:23.988 --> 00:36:26.116
Don't whoo shame me.

770
00:36:26.185 --> 00:36:27.655
I just don't
feel comfortable

771
00:36:27.724 --> 00:36:29.491
with them
in the house. babe.

772
00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.726
Well. I mean. I guess
we could -- I don't know?

773
00:36:31.795 --> 00:36:35.197
Sleep in the car?
If you wanted to do that?

774
00:36:35.266 --> 00:36:39.301
C-Can we please just pump the
brakes on the doom and gloom?

775
00:37:40.097 --> 00:37:42.663
Oh. my God.
Yes. you do!

776
00:37:42.732 --> 00:37:45.735
I do -- I do not
just date Asian guys.

777
00:37:45.804 --> 00:37:47.803
-Yes. you do!
-No. I swear!

778
00:37:47.872 --> 00:37:50.605
Oh. my God.
Ryan. Kevin. Park.

779
00:37:50.674 --> 00:37:52.741
Come on. you have
total Asian fever.

780
00:37:52.810 --> 00:37:55.678
No. I just like
smart. ambitious guys.

781
00:37:55.747 --> 00:37:57.246
It's not
a race thing.

782
00:37:57.315 --> 00:38:00.215
Yeah. but I'm not smart
or ambitious.

783
00:38:00.284 --> 00:38:01.349
Yes. you are.

784
00:38:01.418 --> 00:38:04.753
So we have
a Trivial Pursuit

785
00:38:04.822 --> 00:38:06.555
that looks like
it's from the '90s

786
00:38:06.624 --> 00:38:09.790
and...a deck of cards.

787
00:38:09.859 --> 00:38:14.162
Oh. no. I've been burned
by rental cards before.

788
00:38:14.231 --> 00:38:16.598
They're always missing
that card that I need.

789
00:38:16.667 --> 00:38:18.934
-Mm.
-Okay. you better count them.

790
00:38:19.003 --> 00:38:20.068
You count them.

791
00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:25.373
I'm way too stoned
for this.

792
00:38:25.442 --> 00:38:26.811
I'll count them.

793
00:38:29.046 --> 00:38:30.979
Yo!

794
00:38:31.048 --> 00:38:32.982
How much do you make?

795
00:38:33.051 --> 00:38:34.016
What?

796
00:38:34.085 --> 00:38:35.951
You're not supposed to
ask that. Henry!

797
00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:38.854
How much do you make
doing the videos?

798
00:38:38.923 --> 00:38:41.156
Give me a range.

799
00:38:41.225 --> 00:38:42.857
Um...

800
00:38:42.926 --> 00:38:45.727
Well. it's not like top 10
YouTube influencer money.

801
00:38:45.796 --> 00:38:48.697
but. uh. you know.
I-I get by.

802
00:38:48.766 --> 00:38:50.098
I also work
for an ad agency.

803
00:38:50.167 --> 00:38:52.668
Oh.
Ooh. that must make
a lot of money.

804
00:38:52.737 --> 00:38:54.003
You know. at the ad agency.

805
00:38:54.072 --> 00:38:56.237
I sort if feel like
I'm doing pure evil.

806
00:38:56.306 --> 00:39:00.409
But then Zoe helps the coral
reefs. so it sorta balances out.

807
00:39:00.478 --> 00:39:01.776
Well. in addition
to the podcast.

808
00:39:01.845 --> 00:39:03.512
I also do
freelance photography.

809
00:39:03.581 --> 00:39:05.648
No. you don't.

810
00:39:05.717 --> 00:39:07.282
I shot Christy's wedding.

811
00:39:07.351 --> 00:39:08.951
Yeah. but she
didn't pay you.

812
00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:11.820
And the podcast
doesn't pay yet. either.

813
00:39:11.889 --> 00:39:13.722
He's mostly
a drug dealer.

814
00:39:13.791 --> 00:39:15.558
I also went
to optometry school.

815
00:39:15.627 --> 00:39:16.926
But you didn't finish.

816
00:39:16.995 --> 00:39:18.293
Yet.

817
00:39:18.362 --> 00:39:23.698
So this whole. like. alien
podcast thing you guys do...

818
00:39:23.767 --> 00:39:25.667
Y'all believe that shit?
Like. for real?

819
00:39:25.736 --> 00:39:29.339
Or do y'all just. like.
interested in it ironically?

820
00:39:29.408 --> 00:39:30.739
70/30?

821
00:39:30.808 --> 00:39:33.303
The Esther Dickens thing
is real.

822
00:39:33.372 --> 00:39:36.411
She was visited
by aliens in 1956.

823
00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.112
Here. on this mountain.

824
00:39:38.181 --> 00:39:41.311
They probed all up in her holes
and just set her free.

825
00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:42.717
A-And When she went
to the doctor.

826
00:39:42.786 --> 00:39:44.586
she was like
10 pounds lighter.

827
00:39:44.655 --> 00:39:48.123
And the X-rays showed
she was missing organs.

828
00:39:49.793 --> 00:39:52.194
So the aliens. they -- they --
they come all the way here

829
00:39:52.263 --> 00:39:55.030
to snatch a kidney?

830
00:39:55.099 --> 00:39:56.966
I mean. come on. man.

831
00:39:57.035 --> 00:39:58.901
You're like
Neil deGrasse Tyson.

832
00:39:58.970 --> 00:40:00.736
Why?
'Cause I'm annoying?

833
00:40:00.805 --> 00:40:03.642
No!
'Cause you're smart.

834
00:40:06.877 --> 00:40:08.113
Hmm.

835
00:40:11.315 --> 00:40:13.616
Who lit the fire?

836
00:40:13.685 --> 00:40:15.984
Um. not us.

837
00:40:16.053 --> 00:40:17.552
Oh. yeah.
The fire's back.

838
00:40:17.621 --> 00:40:18.754
Hey. do you guys
want an edible?

839
00:40:18.823 --> 00:40:20.689
-Absolutely.
-No.

840
00:40:20.758 --> 00:40:23.158
They're from Colorado.
They got official packaging.

841
00:40:23.227 --> 00:40:25.360
They're not poisonous.

842
00:40:25.429 --> 00:40:26.895
We're not the killer.

843
00:40:26.964 --> 00:40:29.935
Although that is what
the killer would say.

844
00:40:32.436 --> 00:40:33.535
I'm going to bed.

845
00:40:33.604 --> 00:40:35.507
Okay. I'll be in
in a bit.

846
00:40:37.876 --> 00:40:39.474
Is she okay?

847
00:40:39.543 --> 00:40:40.742
Yeah.
she'll be fine.

848
00:40:40.811 --> 00:40:43.779
We're just going through
some...stuff.

849
00:40:43.848 --> 00:40:46.849
These edibles
are very chill.

850
00:40:46.918 --> 00:40:49.051
They might
chill her out.

851
00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:52.187
No. I appreciate the sentiment.
but probably not.

852
00:40:52.256 --> 00:40:54.656
She's had a lot of. like.
really fucked-up shit

853
00:40:54.725 --> 00:40:56.157
that's happened
to her recently.

854
00:40:56.226 --> 00:40:57.626
Like what?

855
00:40:57.695 --> 00:40:59.662
You're not supposed to
say that. Henry.

856
00:40:59.731 --> 00:41:02.365
It's -- It's -- It's fine.

857
00:41:02.434 --> 00:41:04.069
Um...

858
00:41:06.003 --> 00:41:09.972
You guys really can't
say anything. okay?

859
00:41:10.041 --> 00:41:10.939
Okay.

860
00:41:11.008 --> 00:41:12.441
So she works
for this nonprofit

861
00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:14.943
that helps the coral reefs.
right?

862
00:41:15.012 --> 00:41:16.777
That's cool.
Yeah. very cool.

863
00:41:16.846 --> 00:41:19.448
Wait. I thought
the coral reefs were saved.

864
00:41:19.517 --> 00:41:21.050
I have. like.
the suntan lotion.

865
00:41:21.119 --> 00:41:23.522
It. like. says it's safe
for the reefs.

866
00:41:28.492 --> 00:41:32.027
Hey!
Heeeyyyy! Hey!

867
00:41:32.096 --> 00:41:34.028
Come here!

868
00:41:34.097 --> 00:41:36.898
One night. they're having
this. like. uh. auction. right.

869
00:41:36.967 --> 00:41:39.935
Lots of rich people.
Lots of cash flowing.

870
00:41:40.004 --> 00:41:41.136
You know
how rich people get.

871
00:41:41.205 --> 00:41:43.371
They just want
to save something.

872
00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:46.569
Anyways. part of Zoe's job
is to. like. handle the money.

873
00:41:46.638 --> 00:41:49.478
take it to a bank after hours.
drop it off.

874
00:41:49.547 --> 00:41:51.446
So that day she had.
like. her period.

875
00:41:51.515 --> 00:41:53.981
and it was. like. apparently
like a heavy-flow kind of day

876
00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:57.786
and it started bleeding
through her dress a little bit.

877
00:41:57.855 --> 00:42:00.155
so she asked
one of her co-workers.

878
00:42:00.224 --> 00:42:02.857
a girl named Willow.
if she could take the cash.

879
00:42:02.926 --> 00:42:06.461
So Willow does. and then.
like. on the way to the bank.

880
00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:09.498
she gets robbed
and murdered.

881
00:42:09.567 --> 00:42:10.966
Oh. shit!

882
00:42:11.035 --> 00:42:13.402
What?
Yeah. Yeah.

883
00:42:13.471 --> 00:42:15.370
But -- Okay. but that's not
her fault. though.

884
00:42:15.439 --> 00:42:18.306
Oh. I-I know. I know.
I-I think she knows.

885
00:42:18.375 --> 00:42:20.242
Like. intellectually.

886
00:42:20.311 --> 00:42:23.278
You know. but. like. good luck
explaining that to her.

887
00:42:23.347 --> 00:42:25.146
You know. I mean. she still
feels like it was her fault.

888
00:42:25.215 --> 00:42:27.843
Like it was supposed to be her.
right?

889
00:42:27.912 --> 00:42:30.752
She. like. bought a gun and she.
like. keeps it in her purse.

890
00:42:30.821 --> 00:42:34.189
I mean. it's like
in there right now.

891
00:42:34.258 --> 00:42:35.590
I really shouldn't be
telling you this.

892
00:42:35.659 --> 00:42:37.493
Man. I really.
really shouldn't.

893
00:42:37.562 --> 00:42:39.027
We won't say shit.

894
00:42:39.096 --> 00:42:41.831
Alright. so. like.
not too long ago.

895
00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:44.934
she. like. took too many
sleeping pills

896
00:42:45.003 --> 00:42:46.735
before she went to bed.

897
00:42:46.804 --> 00:42:48.070
Oh. shit.
Yeah. I know.

898
00:42:48.139 --> 00:42:49.404
And she told me
that it was an accident.

899
00:42:49.473 --> 00:42:50.705
and I. like. believed her.

900
00:42:50.774 --> 00:42:51.807
I believed her.
That's my girlfriend.

901
00:42:51.876 --> 00:42:53.108
I love her.
Yeah.

902
00:42:53.177 --> 00:42:54.509
But she. like.
went to treatment.

903
00:42:54.578 --> 00:42:55.977
and that was like
about a year ago.

904
00:42:56.046 --> 00:42:57.407
She's doing better.
She says she's doing better.

905
00:42:57.476 --> 00:42:58.747
But I don't --
I don't know.

906
00:42:58.816 --> 00:43:00.415
Little man: Come here!

907
00:43:02.887 --> 00:43:06.116
Come here. you little scamp.

908
00:43:06.185 --> 00:43:08.724
Come on over here.

909
00:43:08.793 --> 00:43:12.293
I got something to show ya.

910
00:43:12.362 --> 00:43:14.630
Oh. get on over here.

911
00:43:14.699 --> 00:43:16.135
Hmm? Hmm? Hmm?

912
00:43:22.807 --> 00:43:25.340
Nicely done. son!

913
00:43:25.409 --> 00:43:27.542
A lot of people
have trouble with that.

914
00:43:27.611 --> 00:43:30.011
They burn themselves
or whatnot.

915
00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:32.284
But you got
right in here.

916
00:43:43.928 --> 00:43:47.029
This is like that meme.

917
00:43:47.098 --> 00:43:47.897
What?

918
00:43:47.966 --> 00:43:50.532
That meme with the dog.

919
00:43:50.601 --> 00:43:55.031
Where he says.
"This is fine."

920
00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.607
"This is fine."

921
00:43:58.676 --> 00:44:00.310
You know that?

922
00:44:00.379 --> 00:44:01.777
Y-Yes.

923
00:44:01.846 --> 00:44:03.845
But don't you worry.

924
00:44:03.914 --> 00:44:06.415
This is fine.

925
00:44:06.484 --> 00:44:08.153
You want a soda?

926
00:44:10.088 --> 00:44:13.358
I'll take
a Dr Pepper.

927
00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:32.374
Don't you worry about them.
my man.

928
00:44:32.443 --> 00:44:37.313
They have their path.
and you have yours.

929
00:44:37.382 --> 00:44:39.648
Hmm.

930
00:44:39.717 --> 00:44:42.217
No Dr Pepper.

931
00:44:42.286 --> 00:44:46.822
but I got
a Nurse Nutmeg.

932
00:44:46.891 --> 00:44:49.725
You ever had
a Nurse Nutmeg?

933
00:44:49.794 --> 00:44:51.293
No.
Ah!

934
00:44:51.362 --> 00:44:54.329
Even better
than a Dr Pepper.

935
00:44:54.398 --> 00:44:56.831
Goes down easier.

936
00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:58.734
Sorta like it's easier
to get an appointment

937
00:44:58.803 --> 00:45:00.636
with a nurse
than a doctor.

938
00:45:14.017 --> 00:45:16.718
Just pretend to drink it.
It might be poison.

939
00:45:16.787 --> 00:45:18.587
It's not poison.

940
00:45:18.656 --> 00:45:20.188
But I get it.

941
00:45:20.257 --> 00:45:22.690
Just thought
you were thirsty.

942
00:45:22.759 --> 00:45:25.127
Drink it
or don't drink it.

943
00:45:25.196 --> 00:45:32.196
Anyway. that is not
what I wanted to show you.

944
00:46:22.787 --> 00:46:25.090
Goes into the future. too.

945
00:46:31.896 --> 00:46:34.330
Pretty neat. huh?

946
00:46:34.399 --> 00:46:35.331
Yeah.

947
00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.565
Really?

948
00:46:36.634 --> 00:46:38.233
You think so?

949
00:46:38.302 --> 00:46:41.270
Oh. it's so hard to surprise
people these days.

950
00:46:41.339 --> 00:46:43.472
What with the Internet.
all the content.

951
00:46:43.541 --> 00:46:45.174
Special effects.

952
00:46:45.243 --> 00:46:48.276
Everybody's
seen everything.

953
00:46:48.345 --> 00:46:54.083
So I hear you're
the screw-up of the family.

954
00:46:54.152 --> 00:46:55.150
Nah.

955
00:46:55.219 --> 00:46:57.886
Hmm...
That's what I just heard.

956
00:46:57.955 --> 00:47:00.916
Sisters are two doctors.
One's a surgeon?

957
00:47:00.985 --> 00:47:04.292
Yeah. But. um. my parents
just want me to be happy.

958
00:47:04.361 --> 00:47:06.828
So they're happy
you're a drug dealer?

959
00:47:06.897 --> 00:47:09.499
Well.
they don't know that.

960
00:47:09.568 --> 00:47:11.227
I'm also a podcaster.

961
00:47:11.296 --> 00:47:13.602
Podcaster!

962
00:47:13.671 --> 00:47:14.974
Good for you.

963
00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:21.544
What if I told you I could wipe
all the failures from your life?

964
00:47:21.613 --> 00:47:23.048
Wipe it clean?

965
00:47:25.016 --> 00:47:26.515
Sounds like a trap.

966
00:47:28.286 --> 00:47:30.753
Ah. you kids
don't miss a thing.

967
00:47:30.822 --> 00:47:33.749
Real street smart.
you kids.

968
00:47:33.818 --> 00:47:36.692
Your generation
are no suckers.

969
00:47:36.761 --> 00:47:39.789
I'll tell you that.

970
00:47:39.858 --> 00:47:42.534
Do you recognize
that woman there?

971
00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:47.803
Mom?
That's right.

972
00:47:47.872 --> 00:47:50.338
Any guesses who
she's pregnant with?

973
00:47:50.407 --> 00:47:53.041
Probably me.
Or one of my sisters.

974
00:47:53.110 --> 00:47:54.910
You is the correct answer.

975
00:47:54.979 --> 00:47:56.812
She is pregnant
with you.

976
00:47:56.881 --> 00:47:58.813
8 months.

977
00:47:58.882 --> 00:48:04.489
And I have a way of making
your life less disappointing.

978
00:48:06.691 --> 00:48:08.958
This is a magic marker.

979
00:48:09.027 --> 00:48:12.360
Or. in this case.
a magic magic marker.

980
00:48:12.429 --> 00:48:13.828
You go through
that fireplace.

981
00:48:13.897 --> 00:48:18.066
And you see that piece of paper
on the coffee table?

982
00:48:18.135 --> 00:48:20.602
Yeah.
You write A++

983
00:48:20.671 --> 00:48:24.106
on that piece of paper
and you put it on the fridge.

984
00:48:24.175 --> 00:48:26.542
Real quiet now.
Don't wake your mom up.

985
00:48:26.611 --> 00:48:28.543
You write A++.

986
00:48:28.612 --> 00:48:33.616
and that baby in her belly
will be a success.

987
00:48:33.685 --> 00:48:35.851
Wh-What if she wakes up?

988
00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:37.553
That'll terrify her.

989
00:48:37.622 --> 00:48:39.454
You gotta be quiet.

990
00:48:39.523 --> 00:48:41.522
I can't make it all easy
for you.

991
00:48:41.591 --> 00:48:44.959
Success requires
some risk. son.

992
00:48:45.028 --> 00:48:49.898
You know. I'm starting to think
that is part of your problem.

993
00:48:49.967 --> 00:48:53.203
No. I'll -- I'll --
I'll do it.

994
00:48:53.272 --> 00:48:54.974
A++.

995
00:48:58.943 --> 00:49:00.479
Okay.

996
00:50:16.387 --> 00:50:18.686
Nicely done. son.

997
00:50:18.755 --> 00:50:22.390
Your days of failure
are behind you now.

998
00:50:22.459 --> 00:50:24.860
I did exactly
what you said.

999
00:50:24.929 --> 00:50:26.328
A++.

1000
00:50:26.397 --> 00:50:28.330
Right on her stomach.

1001
00:50:28.399 --> 00:50:30.269
What did you say?

1002
00:50:32.871 --> 00:50:34.802
On the refrigerator.
I mean.

1003
00:50:34.871 --> 00:50:38.941
I don't think you followed
my instructions.

1004
00:50:39.010 --> 00:50:41.777
Uh. I-I don't know.

1005
00:50:41.846 --> 00:50:43.311
I --

1006
00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:45.713
I think I did.
A++.

1007
00:50:45.782 --> 00:50:48.845
On her stomach.
No. on the refrigerator.

1008
00:50:48.914 --> 00:50:51.053
Were you high
when you did it?

1009
00:50:51.122 --> 00:50:53.255
It was a magic marker.

1010
00:50:53.324 --> 00:50:56.328
That. son.
is a kitchen knife.

1011
00:50:58.162 --> 00:51:00.332
It was a magic marker.

1012
00:51:02.862 --> 00:51:04.532
I'd love to argue with you

1013
00:51:04.601 --> 00:51:08.540
but I don't debate with people
that don't exist.

1014
00:51:19.283 --> 00:51:22.417
Oh.
Well. uh. I think Zoe's
pretty lucky

1015
00:51:22.486 --> 00:51:24.720
to have a boyfriend
like you.

1016
00:51:24.789 --> 00:51:27.017
Thank you.

1017
00:51:27.086 --> 00:51:28.623
And I'm pretty lucky
to have you. too!

1018
00:51:28.692 --> 00:51:32.761
Aw.
I'm lucky to have you. babe.

1019
00:51:32.830 --> 00:51:35.064
Ben's lucky to have you.

1020
00:51:35.133 --> 00:51:37.565
Where is Ben?
Is he still showering?

1021
00:51:37.634 --> 00:51:39.168
Maybe he's
masturbating.

1022
00:51:39.237 --> 00:51:40.602
Actually.
I-I'm gonna go see

1023
00:51:40.671 --> 00:51:43.575
if he got sucked down
the drain or something.

1024
00:51:46.639 --> 00:51:47.776
Ben is gross.

1025
00:51:47.845 --> 00:51:48.978
A little bit.

1026
00:51:57.488 --> 00:52:00.055
-What's going on?
-Oh. my God. no!

1027
00:52:00.124 --> 00:52:01.490
Beth?
Hey. what's going on?

1028
00:52:01.559 --> 00:52:02.757
Fuck!

1029
00:52:02.826 --> 00:52:05.661
Shit.
D-Don't touch anything.
No. fuck!

1030
00:52:05.730 --> 00:52:06.962
It's evidence.

1031
00:52:07.031 --> 00:52:08.196
Should we move him?

1032
00:52:08.265 --> 00:52:09.397
Should we give him
mouth to mouth?

1033
00:52:09.466 --> 00:52:11.600
He doesn't even have
a fucking mouth!

1034
00:52:11.669 --> 00:52:13.601
Okay. okay. okay.
Where's the sheriff's card?

1035
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:14.703
I'm going to
call the sheriff.

1036
00:52:14.772 --> 00:52:17.842
No. fuck that.
I'm calling 911.

1037
00:52:18.575 --> 00:52:21.242
It's the curse.
You shouldn't have lit the fire!

1038
00:52:21.311 --> 00:52:23.245
Nobody lit
a fucking fire!

1039
00:52:23.314 --> 00:52:25.047
Where were you when we were
in the hot tub?

1040
00:52:25.116 --> 00:52:27.216
What. you think
I did that shit?
Somebody did.

1041
00:52:27.285 --> 00:52:28.983
Just go away.
Go over there.
Fuck you.

1042
00:52:29.052 --> 00:52:31.253
Woman: 911.
What's your emergency?
You need to come now.

1043
00:52:31.322 --> 00:52:32.888
My boyfriend.
he's dead in the shower.

1044
00:52:32.957 --> 00:52:34.655
and his skull is bashed in.

1045
00:52:34.724 --> 00:52:36.425
You say bashed in.
Is he still breathing?

1046
00:52:36.494 --> 00:52:39.761
Of course he's not breathing.
His skull is bashed in --

1047
00:52:44.202 --> 00:52:45.500
What the fuck!

1048
00:52:45.569 --> 00:52:48.103
Alex. it's the log!
It's the fucking log!

1049
00:52:48.172 --> 00:52:49.471
No. no. no. no. no.
somebody --

1050
00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:50.771
somebody threw it
and they're still here.

1051
00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:52.640
It wasn't thrown.
I saw it. It just flew.

1052
00:52:52.709 --> 00:52:54.477
No. no. no. no. no. baby.
No. that's impossible. okay.

1053
00:52:54.546 --> 00:52:56.044
That is impossible.

1054
00:52:56.113 --> 00:52:58.413
It wasn't thrown.
Alex!

1055
00:52:58.482 --> 00:53:00.783
Either way. this log's
going to burn the house down.

1056
00:53:15.066 --> 00:53:16.401
Ah. fuck!

1057
00:53:19.203 --> 00:53:20.564
No!

1058
00:53:27.677 --> 00:53:29.644
911.
What's your emergency?

1059
00:53:29.713 --> 00:53:30.980
Hey. we need your help.
People are murdered!

1060
00:53:31.049 --> 00:53:32.914
Don't say it's a flying log.
They won't come.

1061
00:53:32.983 --> 00:53:34.683
Do you have an address?
I-I-I don't know.

1062
00:53:34.752 --> 00:53:37.553
It's an Airbnb.
It's -- It's Booth Mountain.

1063
00:53:37.622 --> 00:53:39.115
Booth Mountain. uh...

1064
00:53:39.184 --> 00:53:40.922
Please. There's --
There's a log.

1065
00:53:40.991 --> 00:53:42.890
It's pounding on the door!
Alright. Stay calm.

1066
00:53:42.959 --> 00:53:44.692
Can you pull up the address
on an app?

1067
00:53:44.761 --> 00:53:46.495
Do you have an e-mail
with the address?

1068
00:53:46.564 --> 00:53:48.062
Can't you track it?

1069
00:53:48.131 --> 00:53:50.264
Baby. hey. I forwarded you that
e-mail confirmation yesterday.

1070
00:53:50.333 --> 00:53:52.467
Just -- Just check
your e-mail.
I can't pull up
the address for you

1071
00:53:52.536 --> 00:53:53.735
'cause I'm on the phone
right now!

1072
00:53:53.804 --> 00:53:55.804
Please. there is a log
at the door!

1073
00:53:55.873 --> 00:53:58.173
Okay. you say someone is
pounding a log on your door?

1074
00:53:58.242 --> 00:53:59.707
No. no one is pounding
the log!

1075
00:53:59.776 --> 00:54:02.544
The log is fucking
flying by itself!

1076
00:54:02.613 --> 00:54:05.180
Oh. God.

1077
00:54:05.249 --> 00:54:06.782
It stopped.

1078
00:54:06.851 --> 00:54:08.217
Maybe it's gone.

1079
00:54:08.286 --> 00:54:09.484
Wait. wait. Okay.

1080
00:54:09.553 --> 00:54:11.119
The sheriff
came by the house today.

1081
00:54:11.188 --> 00:54:13.788
And he warned us about the log.
We got in trouble for it.

1082
00:54:13.857 --> 00:54:15.190
Yeah. the sheriff will know
where we are!

1083
00:54:15.259 --> 00:54:16.591
You mean a police officer?

1084
00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:18.994
No. no. no. no. the sheriff
and his deputy.

1085
00:54:19.063 --> 00:54:20.529
We don't have a sheriff.

1086
00:54:20.598 --> 00:54:22.530
We have a chief of police.
Her name is Chief Mackies.

1087
00:54:22.599 --> 00:54:25.200
God damn it!
It's a sheriff.

1088
00:54:27.271 --> 00:54:28.637
Hello?

1089
00:54:28.706 --> 00:54:29.909
Hello?

1090
00:54:32.777 --> 00:54:33.845
Zoe!

1091
00:54:34.513 --> 00:54:36.378
Arson!

1092
00:54:36.447 --> 00:54:38.248
Arson!

1093
00:54:38.317 --> 00:54:39.815
Arson!

1094
00:54:39.884 --> 00:54:41.083
Go. go. go!

1095
00:54:41.152 --> 00:54:42.818
Go. go. go.

1096
00:54:44.389 --> 00:54:45.787
No. no.

1097
00:54:45.856 --> 00:54:48.556
-What?
-Trust me. Come on.

1098
00:54:48.625 --> 00:54:51.496
Come on. Come on.
Come. come.

1099
00:54:53.765 --> 00:54:54.929
Okay.

1100
00:54:54.998 --> 00:54:56.831
Why did you bring us in here?
We are trapped!

1101
00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:59.501
No. no. no. no. no. hey. hey.
this is the best place.

1102
00:54:59.570 --> 00:55:01.331
There's no windows. look!

1103
00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:03.606
What about Holly?

1104
00:55:03.675 --> 00:55:05.640
It's going to get Holly.

1105
00:55:05.709 --> 00:55:07.642
Holly --
Holly will be fine.

1106
00:55:07.711 --> 00:55:09.612
She ran outside.
She's probably at the car.

1107
00:55:11.916 --> 00:55:14.049
It's okay.
No. no. no. it's okay.

1108
00:55:14.118 --> 00:55:15.717
We're going to be fine.
We're going to be fine.

1109
00:55:15.786 --> 00:55:17.485
No. we're not.
Shhh!

1110
00:55:17.554 --> 00:55:19.520
Keep your voice down. okay.
please.

1111
00:55:19.589 --> 00:55:21.857
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1112
00:55:21.926 --> 00:55:23.724
Do you still
have your phone?

1113
00:55:23.793 --> 00:55:26.661
No. it died when I was
on the phone with 911.

1114
00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:28.730
Okay. that's good.
Okay. that's good. that's good.

1115
00:55:28.799 --> 00:55:30.899
No!
They're not coming. Alex.

1116
00:55:30.968 --> 00:55:32.701
Of course they're coming.
You hung up on them.

1117
00:55:32.770 --> 00:55:34.269
They don't know
where we are.

1118
00:55:34.338 --> 00:55:35.537
Did you not hear the log?

1119
00:55:35.606 --> 00:55:38.207
It was crying!
It's from hell.

1120
00:55:38.276 --> 00:55:39.674
It's not from hell.
okay!

1121
00:55:39.743 --> 00:55:42.678
Some psychopath in the woods
is fucking with us.

1122
00:55:42.747 --> 00:55:45.013
That's all.
That's all!

1123
00:55:45.082 --> 00:55:49.245
The -- The -- The crying
is prerecorded or something.

1124
00:55:49.314 --> 00:55:50.952
A-And -- And there's
a drone in the wood.

1125
00:55:51.021 --> 00:55:52.654
That's how it can fly around.
What?

1126
00:55:52.723 --> 00:55:55.623
No drone can do that. okay?
It's a cursed log.

1127
00:55:55.692 --> 00:55:57.059
This is not some
Scooby-Doo shit. okay?

1128
00:55:57.128 --> 00:55:58.560
We're gonna be safe in here
for the night. okay.

1129
00:55:58.629 --> 00:56:00.963
We're gonna hide
and be safe.

1130
00:56:01.032 --> 00:56:03.131
That thing's not gonna
be active during the day.

1131
00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:04.599
You don't know that.

1132
00:56:04.668 --> 00:56:07.668
We had that fire going all day
long and nothing happened.

1133
00:56:07.737 --> 00:56:09.838
Hmm? Nothing happened
till the sun went down.

1134
00:56:09.907 --> 00:56:11.306
But did you hear
what it was yelling?

1135
00:56:11.375 --> 00:56:12.808
It was yelling.
"Arson. arson."

1136
00:56:12.877 --> 00:56:15.010
It's going to
burn us alive.

1137
00:56:15.079 --> 00:56:17.779
Alex.
Okay. okay.

1138
00:56:17.848 --> 00:56:21.817
Okay. listen. first sign
of smoke comes under that door.

1139
00:56:21.886 --> 00:56:23.886
we'll make a break
for it. okay?

1140
00:56:23.955 --> 00:56:25.720
Th-There --
Th-There's an axe --

1141
00:56:25.789 --> 00:56:26.956
There's an axe
on the front porch.

1142
00:56:27.025 --> 00:56:30.258
We get the axe.
we get to my car.

1143
00:56:30.327 --> 00:56:33.461
we get off
this mountain.

1144
00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:35.063
The sheriff
was a fake sheriff.

1145
00:56:35.132 --> 00:56:37.465
When he came in. he sprinkled
something on the log.

1146
00:56:37.534 --> 00:56:38.867
I-I didn't think
anything of it.

1147
00:56:38.936 --> 00:56:40.568
What are you talking about?
What are you --

1148
00:56:40.637 --> 00:56:42.504
I didn't think
anything of it.

1149
00:56:42.573 --> 00:56:44.072
He must be. like. in on it
or something.

1150
00:56:44.141 --> 00:56:46.408
I'm sure he cast. like.
an evil spell.

1151
00:56:46.477 --> 00:56:49.711
Zoe. come on.

1152
00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:51.712
You still don't believe
it's a curse.

1153
00:56:51.781 --> 00:56:53.748
With all due respect. babe.
no. I don't.

1154
00:56:53.817 --> 00:56:56.618
If -- If brutality against
Blacks and Native Americans

1155
00:56:56.687 --> 00:56:58.887
in this country
caused curses.

1156
00:56:58.956 --> 00:57:01.891
then murderous logs would be
as common as fuckin' Starbucks.

1157
00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:03.925
And they aren't.
They just aren't.

1158
00:57:03.994 --> 00:57:07.496
A tiny drone
cannot lift a guy.

1159
00:57:07.565 --> 00:57:10.499
Fine. You know what?
I hope it is a curse.

1160
00:57:10.568 --> 00:57:12.400
I do.
We'll write a book.

1161
00:57:12.469 --> 00:57:14.236
A best seller.
We'll be fuckin' rich.

1162
00:57:14.305 --> 00:57:15.504
Oh. my God. Alex.

1163
00:57:15.573 --> 00:57:16.672
If we survive.

1164
00:57:16.741 --> 00:57:19.441
We are going to survive.

1165
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:21.777
This is
a heavy door. babe.

1166
00:57:21.846 --> 00:57:24.079
No windows.
It can't get in.

1167
00:57:24.148 --> 00:57:28.650
We're in the best place
to be right now.

1168
00:57:28.719 --> 00:57:31.686
Oh. my God. my camera.

1169
00:57:31.755 --> 00:57:34.323
My camera's still downstairs.
It's rolling!

1170
00:57:34.392 --> 00:57:37.359
We're gonna have evidence of
this. everything that happened!

1171
00:57:37.428 --> 00:57:38.660
We'll sell it.

1172
00:57:38.729 --> 00:57:40.161
They'll make a movie
out of this.

1173
00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:41.964
Who do you want to play you?
We're going to die. Alex.

1174
00:57:42.033 --> 00:57:43.799
We are not going to die.
We are not going to die.

1175
00:57:43.868 --> 00:57:46.068
Look at me.
Look at me.

1176
00:57:46.137 --> 00:57:47.403
I love you.

1177
00:57:47.472 --> 00:57:49.871
Do you love me?

1178
00:57:49.940 --> 00:57:51.541
I'm gonna need a vocal
confirmation on that. babe.

1179
00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:52.674
Yeah? Yeah?
Yes.

1180
00:57:52.743 --> 00:57:53.776
Okay. good.
I love you. too.

1181
00:57:53.845 --> 00:57:55.545
Do you trust me?
Yes.

1182
00:57:55.614 --> 00:57:56.879
I trust you. too.

1183
00:57:56.948 --> 00:57:58.614
You're the fiercest woman
I know.

1184
00:58:04.021 --> 00:58:06.020
I kinda think Chris Pratt
should play me.

1185
00:58:06.089 --> 00:58:08.451
We need butts in seats. babe.
We're gonna need a name.

1186
00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:11.759
Alright?
This is gonna be a blockbuster.

1187
00:58:11.828 --> 00:58:14.829
So you think this is gonna be
a theatrical movie?

1188
00:58:14.898 --> 00:58:18.633
Not some. like --
like. straight to Netflix --

1189
00:58:18.702 --> 00:58:20.469
Babe. of course this is
theatrical release.

1190
00:58:20.538 --> 00:58:21.603
Look -- Look around you!

1191
00:58:21.672 --> 00:58:23.571
This is not
straight-to-DVD shit

1192
00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:24.974
that's happening to us
in this house right now!

1193
00:58:25.043 --> 00:58:26.541
It's bad.
Yeah. it's really bad.

1194
00:58:26.610 --> 00:58:28.576
It's awful.
It's like the first
proven example

1195
00:58:28.645 --> 00:58:30.711
of real
supernatural shit.

1196
00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:34.649
This is gonna be. like.
Marvel movie big.

1197
00:58:34.718 --> 00:58:37.019
Now. who do you want
to play you?

1198
00:58:40.657 --> 00:58:43.358
Arson!

1199
00:58:43.427 --> 00:58:44.560
Go. go. go!

1200
00:58:46.029 --> 00:58:49.465
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

1201
00:59:10.955 --> 00:59:13.522
No.

1202
00:59:18.161 --> 00:59:22.164
Remember. now.
say nice things to 'em.

1203
00:59:22.233 --> 00:59:24.766
Girls. they like to be
complimented.

1204
00:59:24.835 --> 00:59:26.401
Zoe!
Nice things.

1205
00:59:29.073 --> 00:59:30.472
Zoe!

1206
00:59:30.541 --> 00:59:31.973
Zoe!

1207
00:59:32.042 --> 00:59:33.841
Zoe!

1208
00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:38.308
I would not get in the way
of my son and his date.

1209
00:59:38.377 --> 00:59:40.981
You don't wanna do that.
Nope.

1210
00:59:41.050 --> 00:59:43.951
It's like getting in the way
of a lion and his food.

1211
00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:48.223
Listen. um. we are all
in a lot of danger.

1212
00:59:48.292 --> 00:59:52.088
This -- This house is.
uh -- It's cursed.

1213
00:59:52.157 --> 00:59:53.228
I swear to God.

1214
00:59:53.297 --> 00:59:56.135
Did you see all
the fucking bodies outside?!

1215
00:59:57.262 --> 00:59:58.667
We all in danger.

1216
01:00:01.873 --> 01:00:03.706
Every day is danger.

1217
01:00:03.775 --> 01:00:06.474
You been out there?

1218
01:00:06.543 --> 01:00:09.178
People batshit crazy.

1219
01:00:09.247 --> 01:00:14.349
Eenie. meenie...

1220
01:00:14.418 --> 01:00:20.556
eenie. meenie...

1221
01:00:20.625 --> 01:00:22.624
eenie...

1222
01:00:22.693 --> 01:00:25.428
Pick her.
She's -- She's prettier than me!
...meenie...

1223
01:00:25.497 --> 01:00:26.862
P-Pick her.

1224
01:00:26.931 --> 01:00:29.064
She's prettier.

1225
01:00:29.133 --> 01:00:32.695
Don't pick me.
No.
Eenie. meenie...

1226
01:00:32.764 --> 01:00:36.171
eenie. meenie...
Don't pick me. no.
No.

1227
01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:39.875
...eenie. moe.
Please. no! No!

1228
01:00:39.944 --> 01:00:42.378
No! No!

1229
01:00:42.447 --> 01:00:44.313
No! No!

1230
01:00:44.382 --> 01:00:45.180
Meenie!

1231
01:00:45.249 --> 01:00:46.749
No. no. no.
no. no. no!

1232
01:00:47.952 --> 01:00:49.619
No. no!
God. no!

1233
01:00:49.688 --> 01:00:52.688
No! No! No!

1234
01:01:00.665 --> 01:01:02.434
What's your name?

1235
01:01:05.597 --> 01:01:07.803
You can call me Mother.
honey.

1236
01:01:07.872 --> 01:01:11.807
Mother?
Okay.

1237
01:01:11.876 --> 01:01:13.574
It's nice to meet you.
Mother.

1238
01:01:13.643 --> 01:01:15.944
My name's Alex.
Oh.

1239
01:01:16.013 --> 01:01:20.014
You're doing that thing
where you befriend me.

1240
01:01:20.083 --> 01:01:24.653
So I see you as a human being
instead of a victim

1241
01:01:24.722 --> 01:01:26.121
so I won't harm you.

1242
01:01:29.227 --> 01:01:31.392
Oh. well.
you such a smart one.

1243
01:01:31.461 --> 01:01:33.161
No. no. no. It doesn't have to
be like that. okay?

1244
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:35.063
We can get out of here.
You can let me go.

1245
01:01:35.132 --> 01:01:36.865
I can -- I can
give you money.

1246
01:01:36.934 --> 01:01:38.800
I-I-I have
an engagement ring. right?

1247
01:01:38.869 --> 01:01:41.102
What -- What -- What is it
that you want?

1248
01:01:41.171 --> 01:01:42.805
What do you want. Mother?
What do you want?

1249
01:01:42.874 --> 01:01:46.008
Well. what do I want?

1250
01:01:46.077 --> 01:01:48.476
Hoo-wee!

1251
01:01:48.545 --> 01:01:50.282
What don't I want?

1252
01:01:53.718 --> 01:01:55.017
Mind my manners.

1253
01:01:55.086 --> 01:01:59.858
Now. do you want here
some of this pimento cheese?

1254
01:02:00.719 --> 01:02:03.195
I've been hogging it all.
Come on.

1255
01:02:04.896 --> 01:02:06.862
Come on.
Now...

1256
01:02:09.366 --> 01:02:12.300
You too high class
for pimento cheese?

1257
01:02:12.369 --> 01:02:14.637
You wish
it was foie gras?

1258
01:02:14.706 --> 01:02:16.304
Aah!

1259
01:02:16.373 --> 01:02:17.740
Oh. you vegan?

1260
01:02:17.809 --> 01:02:22.177
Just try pimento...
cheese.

1261
01:02:28.719 --> 01:02:30.318
It's pretty good
pimento cheese

1262
01:02:30.387 --> 01:02:32.821
for store-bought
pimento cheese.

1263
01:02:38.930 --> 01:02:41.833
Anyway. what do I want?

1264
01:02:45.403 --> 01:02:47.669
I want a grandbaby.

1265
01:02:47.738 --> 01:02:51.543
I want my son to give me
a grandbaby.

1266
01:02:52.809 --> 01:02:54.810
But you can't get
a woman pregnant

1267
01:02:54.879 --> 01:02:58.714
when you keep
murdering them. you know?!

1268
01:02:58.783 --> 01:03:00.781
It don't make no sense.

1269
01:03:00.850 --> 01:03:03.151
If he can just click
with one of 'em.

1270
01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:05.488
we can keep her
in the basement.

1271
01:03:05.557 --> 01:03:07.823
We got a nice basement.

1272
01:03:07.892 --> 01:03:10.893
Have a basement family.
huh?

1273
01:03:10.962 --> 01:03:13.362
All safe. all warm.

1274
01:03:13.431 --> 01:03:16.969
If he could just click
with one of 'em.

1275
01:03:19.603 --> 01:03:23.004
It's enough to make me
want to adopt a Chinese baby.

1276
01:03:23.073 --> 01:03:25.911
How'd that look
in church?

1277
01:03:29.347 --> 01:03:32.948
Maybe my son is gonna marry
your girlfriend. huh?

1278
01:03:34.985 --> 01:03:37.653
'Cause right about now.
it don't sound like

1279
01:03:37.722 --> 01:03:39.422
she wants to marry you.

1280
01:03:42.561 --> 01:03:45.927
Oh. we was listening.

1281
01:03:45.996 --> 01:03:49.298
That's how come
we learned...

1282
01:03:49.367 --> 01:03:51.934
she has a little gun.

1283
01:03:52.003 --> 01:03:53.702
She got a little gun.

1284
01:04:00.745 --> 01:04:05.213
Well...mm. you know.

1285
01:04:05.282 --> 01:04:06.815
there's so many
different ways

1286
01:04:06.884 --> 01:04:08.517
to meet women these days.

1287
01:04:08.586 --> 01:04:10.585
Mm-hmm.

1288
01:04:10.654 --> 01:04:13.522
I think he can meet
a really nice girl.

1289
01:04:13.591 --> 01:04:16.225
A girl that likes him
for him. you know?

1290
01:04:16.294 --> 01:04:19.060
Um. yeah. he can use an app.
I can show him.

1291
01:04:19.129 --> 01:04:21.297
I met Zoe on Bumble.

1292
01:04:21.366 --> 01:04:23.332
Bumble?

1293
01:04:23.401 --> 01:04:24.934
That would be about
right for him.

1294
01:04:25.003 --> 01:04:27.803
He's always bumbling.

1295
01:04:27.872 --> 01:04:30.705
Now...

1296
01:04:30.774 --> 01:04:33.976
sometimes. Alex.
your kids will disappoint you.

1297
01:04:34.045 --> 01:04:36.111
Now. his daddy...

1298
01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:39.915
Well. his Daddy was
an insulation salesman.

1299
01:04:39.984 --> 01:04:43.419
He could sell dumbbells
to a drowning man.

1300
01:04:43.488 --> 01:04:45.120
Hmm.

1301
01:04:45.189 --> 01:04:48.323
My son can't sell shit
on account of he's dumb.

1302
01:04:48.392 --> 01:04:50.592
No. no. no. no. there's
a shortage in the trades.

1303
01:04:50.661 --> 01:04:53.495
Mm-hmm. There's a lack
of good tradesman.

1304
01:04:53.564 --> 01:04:55.030
You know. heating and air.
plumbing. garbagemen.

1305
01:04:55.099 --> 01:04:56.531
You know?

1306
01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:58.400
You look at guys like that.
they're all over 50.

1307
01:04:58.469 --> 01:05:00.135
Right?
They're all over 50!

1308
01:05:00.204 --> 01:05:02.671
'Cause kids don't want
to do it anymore.

1309
01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:03.939
But it's good work!

1310
01:05:04.008 --> 01:05:05.340
It's really.
really good work.

1311
01:05:05.409 --> 01:05:06.975
It pays 100 grand a year.
He could do that.

1312
01:05:07.044 --> 01:05:08.877
He can get a girl
and a house.

1313
01:05:08.946 --> 01:05:11.380
It's possible!

1314
01:05:11.449 --> 01:05:13.415
Would that
it were so. Alex.

1315
01:05:13.484 --> 01:05:16.051
You paint a pretty picture.
100 grand.

1316
01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:17.886
It's possible.
it's possible!

1317
01:05:17.955 --> 01:05:19.883
I can show you.

1318
01:05:19.952 --> 01:05:21.557
I can show you both
a different way.

1319
01:05:21.626 --> 01:05:24.392
You know. you're right.

1320
01:05:24.461 --> 01:05:27.129
You're so right.
I'm so glad we talking.

1321
01:05:27.198 --> 01:05:30.135
Let me --
Let me cut these ropes.

1322
01:05:31.369 --> 01:05:35.404
Let me go tell my son
to stop his mess.

1323
01:05:35.473 --> 01:05:38.139
Oh. my God. God bless you.
Mother.

1324
01:05:38.208 --> 01:05:41.146
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

1325
01:05:50.221 --> 01:05:53.917
You must think
I'm really stupid.

1326
01:05:53.986 --> 01:05:58.293
"Oh. I bet she's just
a stupid bitch." huh?

1327
01:05:58.362 --> 01:06:01.196
"your son could be a plumber!"

1328
01:06:02.534 --> 01:06:03.598
Zoe!

1329
01:06:03.667 --> 01:06:06.205
Come on. hang on. baby!
We're gonna be fine!

1330
01:06:20.017 --> 01:06:22.585
I like your boobies.
Mnh-mnh.

1331
01:06:28.827 --> 01:06:30.562
You wanna see my body?

1332
01:06:32.763 --> 01:06:33.762
I'm strong!

1333
01:06:33.831 --> 01:06:35.564
No! Please! No!

1334
01:06:35.633 --> 01:06:36.966
No!

1335
01:06:42.674 --> 01:06:44.840
No. no. No.

1336
01:06:44.909 --> 01:06:46.875
No! No! No! No!
No! No!

1337
01:06:46.944 --> 01:06:49.645
No!! No! No! No!

1338
01:06:49.714 --> 01:06:51.146
No. no.

1339
01:06:51.215 --> 01:06:54.650
No. No. No!

1340
01:06:57.621 --> 01:07:00.625
Do you want to see
my ding dong?

1341
01:07:27.518 --> 01:07:29.118
Mr. Luthor.
he's a nice man!

1342
01:07:29.187 --> 01:07:30.585
Now. if daddy hadn't
loaned me that money.

1343
01:07:30.654 --> 01:07:32.554
I'd have lost this place
and then you all be scattered.

1344
01:07:32.623 --> 01:07:35.024
Everybody!
You promised.

1345
01:07:35.093 --> 01:07:37.158
How could I justify
to Daddy

1346
01:07:37.227 --> 01:07:38.593
selling your boy
for less money?

1347
01:07:38.662 --> 01:07:41.696
Wha- what would I say?
"I'm -- I'm fond of him"?

1348
01:07:41.765 --> 01:07:43.766
I mean. what would that
sound like. Rosa?

1349
01:07:43.835 --> 01:07:45.700
Mr. Armfield is a devil.

1350
01:07:45.769 --> 01:07:47.635
And he's a businessman.
too. now.

1351
01:07:47.704 --> 01:07:49.637
He's cuttin' ears off.
he's cuttin' toes off.

1352
01:07:49.706 --> 01:07:51.840
Oh. my baby! My baby!
Just the bad ones. Rosa!

1353
01:07:51.909 --> 01:07:53.108
It's just the bad ones!

1354
01:07:53.177 --> 01:07:54.642
If he kept doing that
to all his slaves.

1355
01:07:54.711 --> 01:07:56.445
he wouldn't have much
of a business now. would he?

1356
01:07:56.514 --> 01:07:59.281
You gave me your word
and now all you're giving me

1357
01:07:59.350 --> 01:08:00.849
is excuses!
Rosa! Shh! Shh!

1358
01:08:00.918 --> 01:08:03.584
People will hear you!
Mrs. Booth is in the other room.

1359
01:08:03.653 --> 01:08:06.989
Now. take this
to the cookhouse.

1360
01:08:07.058 --> 01:08:08.827
Alright?
I'm -- I'm finished.

1361
01:08:10.661 --> 01:08:13.062
I wish I could done
Mr. Luthor.

1362
01:08:13.131 --> 01:08:14.930
Would that it were so.

1363
01:08:14.999 --> 01:08:16.999
But your son is a good boy.

1364
01:08:17.068 --> 01:08:18.366
Your son is a good worker.

1365
01:08:18.435 --> 01:08:20.636
He's our son!

1366
01:08:20.705 --> 01:08:21.769
He's our son!

1367
01:08:21.838 --> 01:08:24.539
Our son! Our son!
Our son! Our son!

1368
01:08:24.608 --> 01:08:27.843
Our son! Our son!
Our son! Our son!

1369
01:08:27.912 --> 01:08:30.613
Our son! Our son!

1370
01:08:36.554 --> 01:08:40.325
Mommy. no!
You're hurting me!

1371
01:08:41.325 --> 01:08:44.329
No son of mine
is gonna...

1372
01:08:45.396 --> 01:08:48.531
I have nowhere to go!

1373
01:08:58.342 --> 01:09:00.643
You never loved me!

1374
01:09:17.461 --> 01:09:20.128
I'm not a sodomite!

1375
01:09:30.607 --> 01:09:34.509
Pardon my old-lady.
pimento-cheese breath.

1376
01:09:34.578 --> 01:09:37.946
But then you have
pimento-cheese breath. too.

1377
01:09:38.015 --> 01:09:40.382
Don't fuckin' touch me!
Don't fuckin' -- Mnh!

1378
01:09:45.322 --> 01:09:48.656
Hey! Police!
Help! Help!

1379
01:09:48.725 --> 01:09:50.959
We're in here!

1380
01:09:51.028 --> 01:09:53.128
We called the police!

1381
01:09:53.197 --> 01:09:55.430
Oh. you stupid
fucking bitch!

1382
01:09:55.499 --> 01:09:58.629
You and Pleatherface
are fucked!

1383
01:09:58.698 --> 01:10:01.536
Help! Help!

1384
01:10:01.605 --> 01:10:03.838
Help! We're in here!
The killers are in here!

1385
01:10:03.907 --> 01:10:06.511
Does that look like
a police car to you?

1386
01:10:09.513 --> 01:10:12.147
Arvid. we got company!

1387
01:10:17.354 --> 01:10:20.525
Oh.

1388
01:10:23.527 --> 01:10:25.695
You don't belong here.

1389
01:10:31.636 --> 01:10:33.001
Arvid!

1390
01:10:51.055 --> 01:10:52.587
Hey. wait. wait. wait.
wait. wait. wait.

1391
01:10:52.656 --> 01:10:56.491
I'm not with her.
My name is Alex.

1392
01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:58.460
If you have
faster-than-light travel.

1393
01:10:58.529 --> 01:11:00.761
then I know that you're
an advanced race

1394
01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:04.365
and you can probably
understand me. okay?

1395
01:11:04.434 --> 01:11:05.934
If you have
faster-than-light travel.

1396
01:11:06.003 --> 01:11:07.870
then you're --
then you're civilized!

1397
01:11:07.939 --> 01:11:10.266
Um. please just --
just release me.

1398
01:11:10.335 --> 01:11:11.806
If you have
faster-than-light travel.

1399
01:11:11.875 --> 01:11:13.941
then you have empathy.
You have empathy. right?

1400
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:16.945
I-I don't want to be here.
Please! Please!

1401
01:11:17.014 --> 01:11:18.681
You have
faster-than-light tra--

1402
01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:21.183
Aaaaah!

1403
01:11:21.252 --> 01:11:23.751
You're hurting me!

1404
01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:27.022
Oh. my God.
That's a silver alien.

1405
01:11:27.091 --> 01:11:28.224
They're the worst ones.

1406
01:11:28.293 --> 01:11:29.786
Fuck!

1407
01:11:29.855 --> 01:11:33.128
Alex!

1408
01:11:33.197 --> 01:11:34.329
Alex!

1409
01:11:34.398 --> 01:11:36.693
Shut the fuck up.

1410
01:11:36.762 --> 01:11:38.971
Play dead.

1411
01:11:51.482 --> 01:11:54.983
No. no. no! No.

1412
01:11:55.052 --> 01:11:57.285
No. Fuck! No.

1413
01:11:59.456 --> 01:12:02.091
No. no.
No. fuck!

1414
01:12:04.094 --> 01:12:06.731
No! Please! No!

1415
01:12:07.966 --> 01:12:10.933
No. No.

1416
01:12:16.074 --> 01:12:17.940
Isaac?

1417
01:12:18.009 --> 01:12:19.474
Isaac?!

1418
01:12:19.543 --> 01:12:22.844
No!
Rosa. what in -- No!

1419
01:12:22.913 --> 01:12:25.548
Such a shame.
She was so young.

1420
01:12:25.617 --> 01:12:26.982
She would've been so pretty

1421
01:12:27.051 --> 01:12:28.583
if she just kept
that weight off.

1422
01:12:28.652 --> 01:12:30.685
I promise.
It's not what it looks like!

1423
01:12:30.754 --> 01:12:32.954
I'm not a sodomite.
I'm not a sodomite!

1424
01:12:33.023 --> 01:12:35.457
I'm not -- I'm not off!

1425
01:12:35.526 --> 01:12:37.493
Fuck! Oh!

1426
01:12:47.166 --> 01:12:49.199
Bang. bang.
I got you!

1427
01:12:49.268 --> 01:12:51.735
Only in my shoulder.
Bang! Bang!

1428
01:12:56.347 --> 01:12:58.213
What is it?

1429
01:12:58.282 --> 01:12:59.482
An old knife.

1430
01:12:59.551 --> 01:13:00.816
It's rusted.

1431
01:13:00.885 --> 01:13:04.753
Ooh.
I bet that's blood.

1432
01:13:04.822 --> 01:13:07.355
I bet Indians used it
to scalp a woman.

1433
01:13:07.424 --> 01:13:09.458
Indians didn't have knives.
ya dope.

1434
01:13:09.527 --> 01:13:11.660
A cowboy might've used it
to kill an Indian.

1435
01:13:11.729 --> 01:13:13.495
A whole mess of Indians.

1436
01:13:13.564 --> 01:13:15.030
Esther:
What did I tell you boys

1437
01:13:15.099 --> 01:13:17.132
about roughhousing
in the family room?

1438
01:13:17.201 --> 01:13:18.829
Sorry. Mom!

1439
01:13:18.898 --> 01:13:20.369
Go play outside.

1440
01:13:38.089 --> 01:13:40.088
Please.

1441
01:13:55.106 --> 01:13:56.372
You love me.

1442
01:13:59.010 --> 01:14:01.344
You will now touch me
under.

1443
01:14:01.413 --> 01:14:04.016
Aaaah!

1444
01:14:07.385 --> 01:14:09.952
Whoo! Whoo!
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

1445
01:14:34.912 --> 01:14:36.979
Alex!
Oh. my God. baby!

1446
01:14:37.048 --> 01:14:39.447
Hey. hey. hey.
hey. hey. hey.

1447
01:14:39.516 --> 01:14:40.983
Come on. baby.
Come on. come on.

1448
01:14:41.052 --> 01:14:42.818
Come on.
Do you hear me?

1449
01:14:42.887 --> 01:14:45.653
Zoe?
Yeah. Yeah. baby. it's me.

1450
01:14:45.722 --> 01:14:47.656
We're getting the fuck
out of here. you understand?

1451
01:14:47.725 --> 01:14:50.092
Everything's gonna be okay.
Kill me.

1452
01:14:50.161 --> 01:14:51.726
No. no. no. no. no.
do not say that.

1453
01:14:51.795 --> 01:14:53.262
I know you're still
in there. baby. okay?

1454
01:14:53.331 --> 01:14:54.663
Kill me.
You're just in shock.

1455
01:14:54.732 --> 01:14:56.159
You're just in shock.
it's okay.

1456
01:14:56.228 --> 01:14:58.834
Just let me sleep.
Aah!

1457
01:14:58.903 --> 01:15:01.103
Get up!
Get up. get up. come on!

1458
01:15:01.172 --> 01:15:02.471
Get the fuck up. Alex!

1459
01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:04.005
Come on.

1460
01:15:06.044 --> 01:15:09.444
Just stay with me. okay?
Yeah?

1461
01:15:09.513 --> 01:15:11.947
Let's get
to the fucking car.

1462
01:15:12.016 --> 01:15:13.014
My camera.

1463
01:15:13.083 --> 01:15:14.987
Fuck your camera. babe.
come on.

1464
01:15:16.353 --> 01:15:19.654
Fuck! Fuck!

1465
01:15:19.723 --> 01:15:21.892
I'm sorry I told him
to pick you.

1466
01:15:22.859 --> 01:15:25.561
I'm gonna get us out
of here. Willow.

1467
01:15:25.630 --> 01:15:28.331
My name is Holly.

1468
01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:31.200
Hey!

1469
01:15:31.269 --> 01:15:34.002
Hey!

1470
01:15:34.071 --> 01:15:37.606
Come here. girl.

1471
01:15:37.675 --> 01:15:39.341
Come on!

1472
01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:41.180
I won't bite.

1473
01:15:45.316 --> 01:15:47.019
Come on. girl.

1474
01:15:49.653 --> 01:15:52.288
Little farther.
Mm-hmm.

1475
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:08.604
You want something
to eat?

1476
01:16:08.673 --> 01:16:10.973
You must be hungry.

1477
01:16:11.042 --> 01:16:14.342
Something to drink?
I got sodas.

1478
01:16:14.411 --> 01:16:16.946
A towel to freshen up?

1479
01:16:17.015 --> 01:16:21.617
Does the number
100 million

1480
01:16:21.686 --> 01:16:23.586
mean anything to you?

1481
01:16:23.655 --> 01:16:26.121
100 million.

1482
01:16:26.190 --> 01:16:28.724
It means something
to all of us.

1483
01:16:28.793 --> 01:16:31.694
Any guesses?

1484
01:16:31.763 --> 01:16:33.665
I can't move my arms.

1485
01:16:35.599 --> 01:16:38.533
That's the number
of sperms

1486
01:16:38.602 --> 01:16:40.703
in the average ejaculate.

1487
01:16:40.772 --> 01:16:42.970
Crazy. huh?

1488
01:16:43.039 --> 01:16:46.374
So when you were conceived.
your sperm had to beat out

1489
01:16:46.443 --> 01:16:49.078
99 million and change.

1490
01:16:49.147 --> 01:16:51.246
99 million.

1491
01:16:51.315 --> 01:16:52.414
Some odds. huh?

1492
01:16:52.483 --> 01:16:56.351
And when life is too hard
for some people.

1493
01:16:56.420 --> 01:16:58.386
like yourself...

1494
01:16:58.455 --> 01:17:02.723
makes you wonder if that
other 99 million and change

1495
01:17:02.792 --> 01:17:04.726
might have had
a better go of it.

1496
01:17:04.795 --> 01:17:06.394
You know?

1497
01:17:06.463 --> 01:17:08.400
Come here. I wanna
show you something.

1498
01:17:36.426 --> 01:17:41.061
So...here
is your parents' house.

1499
01:17:41.130 --> 01:17:45.370
And this is the night
you get conceived. you see?

1500
01:17:46.136 --> 01:17:48.731
In a little bit.
your parents will come home.

1501
01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:53.308
stumble up those stairs.
have sex and make you!

1502
01:17:53.377 --> 01:17:55.047
Isn't that something?

1503
01:17:56.875 --> 01:18:02.283
Just put this baseball
on the third stair.

1504
01:18:02.352 --> 01:18:05.253
It's dark and your dad
will stumble.

1505
01:18:05.322 --> 01:18:08.490
Be enough to get his balls
a-jostling.

1506
01:18:08.559 --> 01:18:10.825
mix up
that sperm a little.

1507
01:18:10.894 --> 01:18:13.262
Give another sperm
a chance to be born.

1508
01:18:13.331 --> 01:18:15.130
You see?

1509
01:18:15.199 --> 01:18:17.466
Another sperm means
another person.

1510
01:18:17.535 --> 01:18:19.667
And events will change.

1511
01:18:19.736 --> 01:18:23.171
That other person will probably
have a different job.

1512
01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:26.741
causing your co-worker
Willow to live.

1513
01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:29.144
And with another person.
your boyfriend

1514
01:18:29.213 --> 01:18:31.880
will have a chance
to find a better partner.

1515
01:18:31.949 --> 01:18:36.751
and you won't have to suffer
with anxiety anymore.

1516
01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:40.155
Ahh! It's a win-win.
Don't you see?

1517
01:18:40.224 --> 01:18:44.429
Now. does that
sound like a plan?

1518
01:18:46.297 --> 01:18:50.002
Does that sound
like a plan?

1519
01:18:51.163 --> 01:18:53.502
No.

1520
01:18:53.571 --> 01:18:55.140
No what?

1521
01:18:57.508 --> 01:19:00.610
I...want...to...

1522
01:19:00.679 --> 01:19:03.273
I want to live...

1523
01:19:03.342 --> 01:19:05.380
You want to live?

1524
01:19:05.449 --> 01:19:06.548
You have lived!

1525
01:19:06.617 --> 01:19:09.084
Been there. done that.
Didn't care for it.

1526
01:19:09.153 --> 01:19:12.087
Don't you think it's time
for a do-over?

1527
01:19:12.156 --> 01:19:14.384
Hmm?

1528
01:19:14.453 --> 01:19:17.997
You...are...
from...Hell!

1529
01:19:21.733 --> 01:19:24.199
Now. that hurts.

1530
01:19:24.268 --> 01:19:26.734
I'm not from Hell.
I'm from here.

1531
01:19:26.803 --> 01:19:29.141
Just a different time
is all.

1532
01:19:30.208 --> 01:19:31.740
You know. you think
you're a good person.

1533
01:19:31.809 --> 01:19:35.009
But in the future.
they say you're not!

1534
01:19:35.078 --> 01:19:38.413
Don't you think I wish
I was born when you were?

1535
01:19:38.482 --> 01:19:41.984
With progressive views.
your cushy job.

1536
01:19:42.053 --> 01:19:44.720
In your fancy. light-filled.
big-city office.

1537
01:19:44.789 --> 01:19:47.988
With air conditioning.

1538
01:19:48.057 --> 01:19:50.059
Just typing on your little
keyboard all day.

1539
01:19:50.128 --> 01:19:51.494
Type. type. type.

1540
01:19:51.563 --> 01:19:54.462
With your avocado toast.

1541
01:19:54.531 --> 01:19:56.902
I've never even had
an avocado.

1542
01:19:59.169 --> 01:20:02.303
Yeah.
you have privilege. hmm?

1543
01:20:02.372 --> 01:20:07.479
But nobody ever talks
about time privilege.

1544
01:20:08.245 --> 01:20:11.914
What will they say about you
in the future. Zoe. hmm?

1545
01:20:11.983 --> 01:20:13.609
Burning your gas.

1546
01:20:13.678 --> 01:20:15.751
contributing
to global warming.

1547
01:20:15.820 --> 01:20:17.719
Eating your bacon!

1548
01:20:17.788 --> 01:20:19.891
Poor little piggies.

1549
01:20:21.158 --> 01:20:25.193
Stepping over
the homeless people.

1550
01:20:25.262 --> 01:20:27.562
They'll say.
"Why didn't she

1551
01:20:27.631 --> 01:20:31.033
let the homeless people
sleep on her couch?"

1552
01:20:31.102 --> 01:20:33.001
And then
you want a do-over.

1553
01:20:33.070 --> 01:20:36.038
which I am trying
to give you!

1554
01:20:36.107 --> 01:20:38.007
I'd love a do-over.

1555
01:20:38.076 --> 01:20:41.043
But I'm stuck here
in this fucking fire.

1556
01:20:41.112 --> 01:20:43.245
Oh. Zoe.
you found my knife.

1557
01:20:43.314 --> 01:20:45.981
I've been looking
for that forever.

1558
01:20:46.050 --> 01:20:47.916
Thank you!

1559
01:20:47.985 --> 01:20:51.887
Now. do what needs
to be done.

1560
01:20:51.956 --> 01:20:56.492
Put the Goddamn baseball
on the stair.

1561
01:20:56.561 --> 01:20:58.994
Oh!

1562
01:20:59.063 --> 01:21:00.396
Come back here!

1563
01:21:07.038 --> 01:21:09.237
Thank you. Alex.
Thank you. baby!

1564
01:21:09.306 --> 01:21:10.906
Oh. my God.
I just want to sleep. babe.

1565
01:21:10.975 --> 01:21:12.975
No. no. no. no. no. no!
Stay with me!

1566
01:21:13.044 --> 01:21:15.243
Stay with me. yeah?
Let's get out of here.

1567
01:21:15.312 --> 01:21:17.880
Come on. come on.

1568
01:21:34.299 --> 01:21:35.498
Alex.

1569
01:21:35.567 --> 01:21:38.601
Alex. keys.

1570
01:21:38.670 --> 01:21:39.768
The kitchen.

1571
01:21:39.837 --> 01:21:42.537
Fuck!

1572
01:21:42.606 --> 01:21:44.105
I'm not going back
in that fuckin' house.

1573
01:21:44.174 --> 01:21:46.678
I'll run in the woods
if I have to.

1574
01:21:58.856 --> 01:21:59.988
Fat-ass bitch.

1575
01:22:01.959 --> 01:22:04.426
Get your hands off of me.

1576
01:22:04.495 --> 01:22:06.061
Stop it!

1577
01:22:06.130 --> 01:22:07.362
I don't feel right.

1578
01:22:07.431 --> 01:22:10.065
-Nothing I do makes you...
-I hate you!

1579
01:22:10.134 --> 01:22:11.634
-I hate you!
-This isn't working.

1580
01:22:11.703 --> 01:22:13.034
Get the fuck out!

1581
01:22:13.103 --> 01:22:16.171
I'll give you something
to cry about.

1582
01:22:35.625 --> 01:22:38.427
Time to Paul Bunyan your ass.
motherfucker!

1583
01:22:51.141 --> 01:22:53.376
Holy fuck.
We did it!

1584
01:23:24.108 --> 01:23:26.542
No! No!

1585
01:23:51.235 --> 01:23:54.469
No. no. No. you --
You don't understand!

1586
01:23:54.538 --> 01:23:56.506
It's that fake
fucking sheriff!

1587
01:23:56.575 --> 01:23:59.841
You can't leave!

1588
01:23:59.910 --> 01:24:02.410
You're important here.

1589
01:24:02.479 --> 01:24:05.481
This is the dawn
of a new age of --

1590
01:24:05.550 --> 01:24:07.783
Fuck you!

1591
01:24:07.852 --> 01:24:11.323
I can and I will!

1592
01:24:14.058 --> 01:24:15.824
Don't stop.

1593
01:24:15.893 --> 01:24:18.260
I'm not.

1594
01:24:18.329 --> 01:24:20.696
I'm not stopping
until the tank is empty.

1595
01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:08.243
I love you.

1596
01:25:08.312 --> 01:25:10.579
I love you. too. baby.

1597
01:25:10.648 --> 01:25:12.681
No matter
what happens next.

1598
01:25:23.294 --> 01:25:26.365
I think we should make
the logo a tad bit bigger.

1599
01:25:27.331 --> 01:25:30.032
You want the logo bigger?

1600
01:25:30.101 --> 01:25:32.337
I'm kidding.
I'm imitating our client.

1601
01:25:34.038 --> 01:25:35.503
I love it.

1602
01:25:35.572 --> 01:25:37.239
Hey. it's your concept
and your copy.

1603
01:25:37.308 --> 01:25:40.609
I just laid it out.

1604
01:25:40.678 --> 01:25:43.078
Send it.
To the client?

1605
01:25:43.147 --> 01:25:45.380
Yes to the client!

1606
01:25:45.449 --> 01:25:47.650
It's early enough.
we might hear back today.

1607
01:25:47.719 --> 01:25:49.084
I hope not.

1608
01:25:49.153 --> 01:25:50.851
I just love
that glorious moment

1609
01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:53.722
when you send something off
and before you get the notes.

1610
01:25:53.791 --> 01:25:55.557
It's such
a freeing feeling.

1611
01:25:55.626 --> 01:25:57.458
We're not getting notes.
It's fucking perfect.

1612
01:25:57.527 --> 01:26:00.799
Well. just in case. maybe
we should knock off early.

1613
01:26:02.333 --> 01:26:04.132
What would the boss say?
I don't know.

1614
01:26:04.201 --> 01:26:06.301
Maybe you should
ask the boss.

1615
01:26:06.370 --> 01:26:08.636
What do you say. boss?

1616
01:26:08.705 --> 01:26:12.641
I say we should
knock off early.

1617
01:26:12.710 --> 01:26:14.379
Alright.

1618
01:26:17.948 --> 01:26:20.315
So you wanna grab a drink
at the Highlander?

1619
01:26:20.384 --> 01:26:22.151
You sure we have time?
You know William

1620
01:26:22.220 --> 01:26:23.751
loves to get to
the Braves game early.

1621
01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:25.954
Oh. that's right!
Uh. I guess

1622
01:26:26.023 --> 01:26:28.156
we'll just have to grab our
celebratory drink there then.

1623
01:26:28.225 --> 01:26:30.558
Hmm.
Yeah.

1624
01:26:30.627 --> 01:26:32.159
It should be feeling cooler.

1625
01:26:32.228 --> 01:26:36.665
A.C.'s pretty old. but I think
I beat it into submission.

1626
01:26:36.734 --> 01:26:39.201
I feel
a difference already.

1627
01:26:39.270 --> 01:26:41.436
Thanks. Arvid.
No problem.

1628
01:26:41.505 --> 01:26:43.438
Traffic is gonna be hell.

1629
01:26:43.507 --> 01:26:46.041
I wish we could just
teleport ourselves there.

1630
01:26:46.110 --> 01:26:48.276
Would that it were so..

1631
01:26:48.345 --> 01:26:50.711
I think I beat it
into submission.

1632
01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:52.680
We're taking William
to the...
Would that it were so.

1633
01:26:52.749 --> 01:26:54.515
I think I beat it
into submission.

1634
01:26:54.584 --> 01:26:55.917
We're taking William
to the...

1635
01:26:55.986 --> 01:26:57.052
Would that it were so.

1636
01:26:57.121 --> 01:26:59.087
I think I beat it
into submission.

1637
01:26:59.156 --> 01:27:01.356
We're taking William
to the...

1638
01:27:01.425 --> 01:27:02.523
Would that it were so.

1639
01:27:02.592 --> 01:27:04.793
I think I beat it
into submission.

1640
01:27:04.862 --> 01:27:08.096
We're taking William
to the...

1641
01:27:08.165 --> 01:27:09.330
Would that it were so.

1642
01:27:09.399 --> 01:27:11.332
We're taking William
to the...

1643
01:27:11.401 --> 01:27:13.401
I'm sorry. Rosa.

1644
01:27:13.470 --> 01:27:16.071
I'm sorry for what I did.

1645
01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:17.807
I'm sorry for everything.

1646
01:27:17.876 --> 01:27:19.770
I love you. Rosa.

1647
01:27:19.839 --> 01:27:21.343
Forgive me. Rosa.

1648
01:27:21.412 --> 01:27:22.878
I'm sorry for everything.

1649
01:27:22.947 --> 01:27:26.115
I love you. Rosa.
I'm sorry for what I did.

1650
01:27:26.184 --> 01:27:27.350
Sorry for all the --
