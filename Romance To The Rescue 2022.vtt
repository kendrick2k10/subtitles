00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.734
asking for
"ready-made lemon curd."

46
00:02:18.867 --> 00:02:21.333
I mean. I've never
seen it before. Have you?

47
00:02:21.467 --> 00:02:24.033
I don't think so...

48
00:02:24.166 --> 00:02:25.934
but I'll find some.

49
00:02:26.967 --> 00:02:28.200
Okay.

50
00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:31.867
This is a brand-new product
that I just brought in.

51
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.533
It's lemon curd.

52
00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:35.734
It brightens up pancakes.
ice cream.

53
00:02:35.867 --> 00:02:37.033
and it tastes

54
00:02:37.166 --> 00:02:38.967
especially delicious
in a tart.

55
00:02:40.367 --> 00:02:42.166
Enjoy.

56
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.000
Hi! So. this is the product.

57
00:02:44.133 --> 00:02:45.633
It is organic...

58
00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:48.600
Check.

59
00:02:48.734 --> 00:02:51.767
Wow. My to-do list
is "get the sofa cleaned"

60
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.033
and "pick up guacamole."

61
00:02:54.667 --> 00:02:55.900
Well...

62
00:02:56.033 --> 00:02:57.433
both important.

63
00:02:57.567 --> 00:02:59.533
but this is a bit of
a bigger-picture plan.

64
00:02:59.667 --> 00:03:01.300
because if you take control.

65
00:03:01.433 --> 00:03:04.400
your life will turn out
just as you'd hoped.

66
00:03:04.533 --> 00:03:07.633
So. next. is selling
and marketing your own product?

67
00:03:07.767 --> 00:03:09.266
Yeah.

68
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.633
That's why I'm trying to learn
what sells and what doesn't.

69
00:03:11.767 --> 00:03:12.967
So what about number five?

70
00:03:14.533 --> 00:03:16.066
"Find the perfect partner"?

71
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.300
I see that's not
checked off yet.

72
00:03:17.433 --> 00:03:19.266
- I'm working on it.
- And?

73
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.600
Who is this "perfect partner"?

74
00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:22.934
Oh.

75
00:03:23.066 --> 00:03:23.934
That's easy.

76
00:03:24.066 --> 00:03:24.934
Ahem.

77
00:03:25.066 --> 00:03:26.133
Whoever...

78
00:03:26.266 --> 00:03:28.600
meets this criteria.

79
00:03:31.066 --> 00:03:33.633
"Loyal. dependable.
faithful..."

80
00:03:33.767 --> 00:03:34.934
"gluten-free"?

81
00:03:35.066 --> 00:03:35.834
Yeah.

82
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.000
Well. other than that.
it sounds like

83
00:03:38.133 --> 00:03:39.900
you're looking for a dog
more than a man.

84
00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:41.333
I mean. what about...

85
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:43.900
...fun?

86
00:03:44.033 --> 00:03:47.000
Or how about
being a best friend?

87
00:03:47.133 --> 00:03:49.867
- Yeah--
- How about...

88
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.734
...love?

89
00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:56.133
That will all happen.
of course.

90
00:03:56.266 --> 00:03:58.467
as long as he is all of this.

91
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.734
I just need to make sure.

92
00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:04.467
I cannot end up
like my mother.

93
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.233
But isn't your mother
traveling the world?

94
00:04:07.633 --> 00:04:09.367
Because that doesn't
sound terrible!

95
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.700
She is. but that's only
because I convinced her to.

96
00:04:12.834 --> 00:04:15.734
My mother has been miserable
for years.

97
00:04:15.867 --> 00:04:17.333
ever since my father left us.

98
00:04:18.467 --> 00:04:20.567
So. anything I can do in life

99
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.700
to minimize that type
of disappointment again.

100
00:04:23.834 --> 00:04:25.000
I will.

101
00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:29.066
Well. I'm rolling the dice
on Peter.

102
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.800
whose online profile states
that he's fun and funny.

103
00:04:32.767 --> 00:04:35.233
Because as far as
I'm concerned.

104
00:04:35.367 --> 00:04:38.033
you can't control everything
in your life...

105
00:04:38.166 --> 00:04:39.900
especially...

106
00:04:40.033 --> 00:04:41.734
not love.

107
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.900
See you tomorrow.

108
00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:45.200
Oh. Mark!

109
00:04:45.333 --> 00:04:47.333
Don't stay out too late.
because. remember.

110
00:04:47.467 --> 00:04:50.233
we are meeting with
the new store manager tomorrow.

111
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.667
And. uh. just...

112
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.367
watch out for signs
that this guy...

113
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.834
he might flake on you.

114
00:04:56.967 --> 00:04:57.967
Don't worry.

115
00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.900
I'm planning to be reckless

116
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.600
and fall head over heels
at first sight.

117
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.567
Bye!

118
00:05:23.734 --> 00:05:25.033
Well. you know what.
thank you so. so much

119
00:05:25.166 --> 00:05:27.100
for stopping by
with the samples.

120
00:05:27.233 --> 00:05:28.934
and. uh. I'll give you a call
if we're interested.

121
00:05:29.066 --> 00:05:30.066
Bye.

122
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.300
Hey!

123
00:05:31.433 --> 00:05:32.767
You're late.

124
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.500
Nah. it's okay.
the new manager just got here.

125
00:05:35.834 --> 00:05:36.900
Apparently.
he's been with Merils

126
00:05:37.033 --> 00:05:37.834
since he was a stock boy.

127
00:05:37.967 --> 00:05:40.200
now he owns
and manages two stores.

128
00:05:40.333 --> 00:05:41.867
This will be his third.

129
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.734
Since he was a stock boy. huh?

130
00:05:44.867 --> 00:05:46.233
Now. that's loyal
to the company.

131
00:05:46.367 --> 00:05:47.734
He was even wooed
by our competitors

132
00:05:47.867 --> 00:05:49.133
for more money.

133
00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:51.767
- Now that's faithful.
- And dependable.

134
00:05:52.633 --> 00:05:54.967
Hang on.
Loyal. faithful. dependable.

135
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.767
Check. check. check!

136
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.266
And no wedding ring
that I can see.

137
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.500
so... check!

138
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.934
It's gonna be really awesome.

139
00:06:05.066 --> 00:06:06.100
Oh. you better get over there

140
00:06:06.233 --> 00:06:09.266
because I see Lara is
on the prowl for a new man.

141
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.633
and she is working that.

142
00:06:10.767 --> 00:06:12.367
Oh!

143
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.867
I'm on it.

144
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.467
Yeah?

145
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.500
Yeah. I would love that.

146
00:06:17.633 --> 00:06:19.467
Hi! My name's Kyra.

147
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.166
I am the store's product buyer.

148
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.200
Kyra! Heard lots about you.

149
00:06:23.333 --> 00:06:24.800
Clearly. they're true.

150
00:06:24.934 --> 00:06:26.700
because this display
is fantastic.

151
00:06:26.834 --> 00:06:28.200
Thank you.

152
00:06:28.333 --> 00:06:30.800
You know. there's nothing
quite like showing customers

153
00:06:30.934 --> 00:06:33.266
what a new product looks like
and tastes like.

154
00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.767
I couldn't agree more.

155
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.300
Would you like to try some?

156
00:06:36.433 --> 00:06:37.767
They're whole wheat.

157
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.834
I would.
but I'm doing gluten-free.

158
00:06:40.834 --> 00:06:41.767
Check! Ahem.

159
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.633
So... tell me.

160
00:06:44.767 --> 00:06:47.200
How would you go about marketing
a new brand of dog food?

161
00:06:47.333 --> 00:06:50.200
Because. unfortunately. we can't
bring dogs into the store.

162
00:06:50.333 --> 00:06:51.934
otherwise I'd bring mine
to work.

163
00:06:52.066 --> 00:06:53.200
I hate being away from him.

164
00:06:53.333 --> 00:06:54.467
Oh. me too.

165
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.767
It breaks my heart

166
00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.467
being away from
my little queen Antoinette.

167
00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.867
That's funny.
I call mine "King".

168
00:07:00.066 --> 00:07:02.100
It's not because
he's royalty in the house.

169
00:07:02.233 --> 00:07:05.000
Oh. my little girl
definitely rules the roost.

170
00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:06.700
Here.

171
00:07:06.834 --> 00:07:08.934
She even has
her own Insta page.

172
00:07:09.066 --> 00:07:10.734
Oh. so does my King.

173
00:07:11.867 --> 00:07:13.600
Well. you know.
in terms of brainstorming

174
00:07:13.734 --> 00:07:14.900
for the new dog-food brand--

175
00:07:16.033 --> 00:07:17.033
- ...We could. uh--
- That's amazing.

176
00:07:17.166 --> 00:07:18.700
...do like a little bone--

177
00:07:18.834 --> 00:07:19.834
So cute.

178
00:07:19.967 --> 00:07:22.500
...has these really cool
eyes. too.

179
00:07:22.633 --> 00:07:24.367
- So does my King!
- Aww!

180
00:07:25.467 --> 00:07:27.600
[Lara. laughs] I know!

181
00:07:27.734 --> 00:07:28.734
Kyra has a dog.

182
00:07:31.133 --> 00:07:32.133
Uh. you do?

183
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.367
What kind?

184
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.500
Uh...

185
00:07:36.633 --> 00:07:39.400
It's a like a short-hair.
but a little... long. too.

186
00:07:40.867 --> 00:07:42.266
Do you have a picture?

187
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.867
No. He's camera-shy.

188
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.233
Oh. not my little queen.

189
00:07:46.367 --> 00:07:48.734
In fact. she's been
in a few commercials.

190
00:07:48.867 --> 00:07:49.834
Amazing.

191
00:07:49.967 --> 00:07:51.934
I think I'm going to have
to meet your Antoinette.

192
00:07:52.066 --> 00:07:54.066
Kyra's dog's
been in commercials.

193
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.700
I thought you just said
he was camera-shy.

194
00:07:56.834 --> 00:07:58.233
H-He is.

195
00:07:58.367 --> 00:08:01.066
When I try to take
a picture of him.

196
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.600
Oh. Well. Antoinette's won
more dog shows than I can count.

197
00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:05.934
Really?

198
00:08:06.066 --> 00:08:07.734
I'm just getting more impressed
by the minute.

199
00:08:07.867 --> 00:08:09.333
Sparky's dad
is actually a champion!

200
00:08:09.467 --> 00:08:11.000
"Sparky"?

201
00:08:11.133 --> 00:08:12.300
Your dog.

202
00:08:12.433 --> 00:08:13.967
Right.

203
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.500
Well. my baby
is survival-trained.

204
00:08:16.633 --> 00:08:18.800
Well. my Sparky is...

205
00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.800
...um...

206
00:08:21.934 --> 00:08:22.667
Agility-trained?

207
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.333
Agility-trained. Yes.

208
00:08:24.467 --> 00:08:26.100
Well. that couldn't be
more perfect!

209
00:08:26.233 --> 00:08:28.133
We'll enter him
into the "Superpups" show.

210
00:08:28.266 --> 00:08:29.433
I'm sorry. what?

211
00:08:29.567 --> 00:08:31.500
Head office
is sponsoring the "Superpups"--

212
00:08:31.633 --> 00:08:34.233
the new canine food
that I was talking about.

213
00:08:34.367 --> 00:08:36.066
Lara. what about Antoinette?

214
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.333
Oh. well. she's not
exactly agility-trained.

215
00:08:39.467 --> 00:08:40.166
Aw. too bad.

216
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.100
But we still have
Kyra and Sparky.

217
00:08:43.233 --> 00:08:45.500
This is gonna be great promo
for the store.

218
00:08:45.633 --> 00:08:48.100
In fact. I'm gonna call
head office right now.

219
00:08:48.233 --> 00:08:50.000
and have them include you
on the print ads.

220
00:08:50.133 --> 00:08:51.333
Oh. I--

221
00:08:52.433 --> 00:08:54.800
Do what you have to
to get me a photo.

222
00:08:54.934 --> 00:08:57.734
Uh... will do!

223
00:08:57.867 --> 00:09:01.900
I think you got yourself
into a corner this time. keener.

224
00:09:03.433 --> 00:09:05.266
Where am I gonna get a dog?

225
00:09:06.533 --> 00:09:07.900
I. I. I... don't know.

226
00:09:08.033 --> 00:09:10.000
Agility-trained?

227
00:09:11.767 --> 00:09:13.867
Uh. great. well. thanks anyway.

228
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.066
Bye.

229
00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.166
Ah! I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

230
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.500
Every single breeder
I've talked to

231
00:09:18.633 --> 00:09:20.500
says I can't just buy
an agility-trained dog.

232
00:09:20.633 --> 00:09:22.633
I'm sorry.
Thought I was helping.

233
00:09:22.767 --> 00:09:24.233
I mean. he's totally
your number five.

234
00:09:24.367 --> 00:09:25.567
I know. right?

235
00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.467
He is exactly
what I'm looking for.

236
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.567
So what are you gonna do?

237
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.500
Well. guess I'm gonna have
to grab this bull--

238
00:09:31.633 --> 00:09:32.633
or this dog--

239
00:09:32.767 --> 00:09:34.333
by the horns

240
00:09:34.467 --> 00:09:37.834
and find one
I can train myself.

241
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.133
♪ Oh. come along with me

242
00:09:43.266 --> 00:09:45.300
♪ I'll show you just how much

243
00:09:45.433 --> 00:09:48.400
♪ You're missing out on

244
00:09:48.533 --> 00:09:49.834
♪ When you're stuck

245
00:09:49.967 --> 00:09:51.633
Can I help you?

246
00:09:51.767 --> 00:09:52.867
Oh. Uh...

247
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.900
Yes. actually.

248
00:09:55.033 --> 00:09:57.000
I am looking
for a dog to adopt.

249
00:09:57.133 --> 00:09:58.567
All right.

250
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.233
Why?

251
00:10:00.367 --> 00:10:01.467
I'm sorry. what?

252
00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.734
Why?

253
00:10:02.867 --> 00:10:04.300
Why are you looking for a dog?

254
00:10:04.433 --> 00:10:06.834
Because I like dogs

255
00:10:06.967 --> 00:10:09.467
and I would like
to adopt one?

256
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.133
Well. I'd like
a vintage Corvette.

257
00:10:11.266 --> 00:10:13.233
but then I'd need
to find time to care for it.

258
00:10:13.367 --> 00:10:14.367
make sure it gets out
for a spin.

259
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.200
clean it.
put money into it.

260
00:10:16.333 --> 00:10:17.633
so probably I figure
it's too much work

261
00:10:17.767 --> 00:10:19.166
and end up taking it back
to the dealer.

262
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.633
Uh... right. Um...

263
00:10:21.767 --> 00:10:24.200
- My point is--
- Oh. thank goodness.

264
00:10:24.333 --> 00:10:28.900
A lot of people come in here
looking for a dog. but...

265
00:10:29.033 --> 00:10:31.333
they don't realize how much work
goes into them.

266
00:10:31.467 --> 00:10:33.200
so. they just end up
giving up on them.

267
00:10:33.333 --> 00:10:35.633
Oh. no! No. No. no. no.
I am not one of those people.

268
00:10:35.767 --> 00:10:36.667
Trust me.

269
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:37.567
Well. I'd like to.

270
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.066
but I've heard
those words before.

271
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.867
So. if you're really serious.

272
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.300
then we can go into my office

273
00:10:44.433 --> 00:10:45.967
and see if you're a candidate
for adoption.

274
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.533
Okay. let's do it.

275
00:10:47.667 --> 00:10:49.667
All right.

276
00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:56.233
Wow.

277
00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:01.433
Um. you the manager
of the shelter or--?

278
00:11:01.567 --> 00:11:03.800
Uh. I'm the owner.

279
00:11:03.934 --> 00:11:05.433
Kevin Walker.

280
00:11:06.767 --> 00:11:08.567
Uh. Kyra Fowler.

281
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.934
Soon-to-be dog owner. I hope.

282
00:11:12.734 --> 00:11:14.533
Okay.

283
00:11:14.667 --> 00:11:16.867
Well. there are
a few standard questions

284
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.066
we need to ask
before you can be approved.

285
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.300
Number one. does anyone

286
00:11:20.433 --> 00:11:22.133
in the home
or building where you live

287
00:11:22.266 --> 00:11:23.533
have a problem
with you owning a dog?

288
00:11:23.667 --> 00:11:26.734
Nope. Just me. myself. and I.

289
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Okay.

290
00:11:29.133 --> 00:11:31.233
And how many hours a day
will the dog be left alone?

291
00:11:31.367 --> 00:11:33.667
Well. let's see.
I work in eight-hour shifts.

292
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.467
So... uh. but I could
be home for lunch.

293
00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.967
I will be home for lunch.

294
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.433
Every day.

295
00:11:43.867 --> 00:11:45.767
And have you ever
owned a dog before?

296
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.667
No. but I did have a goldfish
when I was six.

297
00:11:50.867 --> 00:11:51.900
Look.

298
00:11:52.033 --> 00:11:52.934
I have a plan.

299
00:11:53.333 --> 00:11:55.800
and I have every intention
on following through with it.

300
00:11:55.934 --> 00:11:59.934
and recently. that plan
involves a dog. so...

301
00:12:00.133 --> 00:12:01.533
Well...

302
00:12:01.667 --> 00:12:04.333
even the best-laid plans
don't always work out.

303
00:12:04.467 --> 00:12:06.200
and. from what
I can tell so far.

304
00:12:06.333 --> 00:12:08.200
you're not really
a candidate for a dog.

305
00:12:08.333 --> 00:12:10.266
Maybe a cat
would be a better fit.

306
00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.533
No. no. no. no! Wait.

307
00:12:11.667 --> 00:12:13.433
I don't think you understand.

308
00:12:13.567 --> 00:12:15.700
I-I will make it work.

309
00:12:15.834 --> 00:12:17.967
because I am not one
of those people who gives up.

310
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.934
and if you are worried
that I will bring the dog back.

311
00:12:21.066 --> 00:12:22.467
you don't have to be.

312
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.333
because I would never abandon
anyone or anything.

313
00:12:25.467 --> 00:12:27.233
because...

314
00:12:28.467 --> 00:12:30.767
...because I know
what that's like.

315
00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.900
and I wouldn't wish that
on anyone.

316
00:12:38.233 --> 00:12:39.533
Right.

317
00:12:47.934 --> 00:12:50.600
All right.

318
00:12:50.734 --> 00:12:52.633
Let's find you a dog.

319
00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.100
So. any ideas
what you're looking for?

320
00:12:58.233 --> 00:12:59.633
Breed? Size?

321
00:12:59.767 --> 00:13:02.166
Um. I would like
an athletic dog.

322
00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:03.834
Oh. and smart.

323
00:13:03.967 --> 00:13:05.500
I would really like
to sink my teeth into training.

324
00:13:05.633 --> 00:13:08.200
You know.
kind of like those "Superpups"?

325
00:13:08.333 --> 00:13:09.233
The agility-trained ones?

326
00:13:09.367 --> 00:13:10.333
Bingo.

327
00:13:10.467 --> 00:13:11.867
Oh. Okay.

328
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.500
So you want a challenge?

329
00:13:14.633 --> 00:13:16.533
I love a challenge.

330
00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.300
Then I've got the dog for you.

331
00:13:23.967 --> 00:13:25.100
Hey.

332
00:13:25.233 --> 00:13:26.700
This here is Sam.

333
00:13:26.834 --> 00:13:27.767
He's almost five.

334
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.100
He's a Border Collie-
Australian Shepherd mix.

335
00:13:30.233 --> 00:13:32.567
Hi! Hi. Sam!

336
00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.400
Look at you.
Look at you!

337
00:13:35.533 --> 00:13:38.033
How did you end up in here? Hmm?

338
00:13:38.166 --> 00:13:41.767
Sam's owner took a job overseas
and left him behind.

339
00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.600
It's heartbreaking.

340
00:13:43.734 --> 00:13:45.000
because these guys
can't understand

341
00:13:45.133 --> 00:13:46.767
why the people they love
abandon them.

342
00:13:48.033 --> 00:13:48.934
Wow.

343
00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.433
I get it. Sam.

344
00:13:52.567 --> 00:13:54.767
Because. years ago.
my dad left.

345
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:56.433
took a job
across the country.

346
00:13:56.567 --> 00:13:59.233
and I still
don't get it.

347
00:13:59.367 --> 00:14:02.000
But you know what?
That's okay.

348
00:14:02.133 --> 00:14:05.800
Because you are
coming home with me!

349
00:14:05.934 --> 00:14:08.800
Yeah!

350
00:14:17.066 --> 00:14:18.266
Ooh!

351
00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.467
Sam! Home. sweet home.

352
00:14:21.533 --> 00:14:22.467
Okay. here.

353
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.834
Why don't you try out
your nice. comfy bed?

354
00:14:25.967 --> 00:14:27.567
Good. Sam! Good boy.

355
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:28.834
Good boy!

356
00:14:28.967 --> 00:14:31.300
I'm gonna do some homework.

357
00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:44.433
"Dog... agility."

358
00:14:47.867 --> 00:14:49.066
Hmm.

359
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.133
That's incredible!

360
00:14:51.266 --> 00:14:53.500
Yes. yes. yes. yes. yes!

361
00:15:02.333 --> 00:15:03.300
Sam!

362
00:15:03.433 --> 00:15:05.900
What are you doing?
It is 3:00 in the morning!

363
00:15:06.033 --> 00:15:07.333
Go to bed!

364
00:15:07.467 --> 00:15:08.700
Or just...

365
00:15:08.834 --> 00:15:10.667
go to the sofa.

366
00:15:14.867 --> 00:15:16.533
Look. if this is a ploy
to get into my bed.

367
00:15:16.667 --> 00:15:17.867
forget it.

368
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:25.166
Okay.

369
00:15:38.367 --> 00:15:40.667
Sam.

370
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.900
All right.
let's get you on this walk

371
00:15:43.033 --> 00:15:44.033
before I go to wo--

372
00:15:44.166 --> 00:15:44.834
ahh!

373
00:15:44.967 --> 00:15:46.133
Oh. Sam!

374
00:15:46.266 --> 00:15:47.867
Oh!

375
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.233
Sam! Whoa!

376
00:15:52.967 --> 00:15:57.500
All right. Sam. I will be home
for lunch in a couple of hours.

377
00:15:57.633 --> 00:15:59.600
Okay?

378
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:04.934
Very funny.

379
00:16:06.333 --> 00:16:08.433
Thank you.

380
00:16:08.567 --> 00:16:09.767
Now be good. Sam.

381
00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.967
Be good.

382
00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.667
My phone.

383
00:16:29.533 --> 00:16:31.500
Oh. my gosh.

384
00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.266
Oh. now.
don't you try to be cute.

385
00:16:39.433 --> 00:16:42.133
Aw. Sam.

386
00:16:42.266 --> 00:16:45.100
Are you gonna help me clean up?

387
00:16:45.233 --> 00:16:47.266
This is... incredible.

388
00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.133
Hey. Kyra!

389
00:16:53.266 --> 00:16:56.600
Listen. do you think you could
cover for me today?

390
00:16:56.734 --> 00:16:57.800
Are you not coming in?

391
00:16:57.934 --> 00:17:00.133
I mean. you always come in.

392
00:17:00.266 --> 00:17:02.600
And you have
that meeting with Trevor.

393
00:17:02.734 --> 00:17:05.667
Right. I am gonna ask
to do that on a video call.

394
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.633
because. uh-- ha.

395
00:17:07.767 --> 00:17:09.100
Guess what?

396
00:17:09.233 --> 00:17:11.367
I got a dog!

397
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:12.467
Really?

398
00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:14.867
Is it trained?

399
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.200
Eh. working on it.

400
00:17:17.767 --> 00:17:19.100
Uh. you know what?
I've got to go.

401
00:17:19.233 --> 00:17:20.834
but I will talk to you soon.

402
00:17:20.967 --> 00:17:22.500
Thank you
so. so. so. so. so. so much!

403
00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.300
Ugh!

404
00:17:31.633 --> 00:17:32.834
Hi.

405
00:17:32.967 --> 00:17:35.333
What are you doing here?

406
00:17:35.467 --> 00:17:37.533
Didn't you read
the adoption agreement?

407
00:17:37.667 --> 00:17:39.800
I haven't had a chance yet.

408
00:17:39.934 --> 00:17:41.533
Ah. Okay.

409
00:17:41.667 --> 00:17:42.633
Well. it states

410
00:17:42.767 --> 00:17:44.934
that you'll be getting
a house call to check in.

411
00:17:45.066 --> 00:17:46.100
I was in the neighborhood

412
00:17:46.233 --> 00:17:47.333
following up
with another family.

413
00:17:47.467 --> 00:17:48.533
and figured
I'd see if you were home.

414
00:17:48.667 --> 00:17:50.133
Guess I got lucky.

415
00:17:52.767 --> 00:17:55.300
Ha. So lucky!

416
00:17:55.433 --> 00:17:57.000
Hey. you know what?
It's a beautiful day outside.

417
00:17:57.133 --> 00:17:58.200
- why don't we go for a wal--
- Well. actually.

418
00:17:58.333 --> 00:18:00.433
we prefer to walk
through the home.

419
00:18:00.567 --> 00:18:02.233
confirm that it's pet-friendly.

420
00:18:02.367 --> 00:18:05.100
I have to admit.
I'm a little bit embarrassed.

421
00:18:05.233 --> 00:18:06.233
because my place is a mess
right now--

422
00:18:06.367 --> 00:18:07.066
Oh. I'm sure it's fine.

423
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.200
Sure.

424
00:18:09.333 --> 00:18:10.867
Uh...

425
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.033
Um. hey. actually--

426
00:18:13.166 --> 00:18:15.500
Wow.

427
00:18:15.633 --> 00:18:17.667
There was a fly
in here earlier--

428
00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.700
...buzzing around

429
00:18:19.834 --> 00:18:22.066
and. uh. uh. uh. I.
I mean. Sam. uh.

430
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.500
was chasing it and. uh...

431
00:18:24.633 --> 00:18:26.734
I had my swatter out.

432
00:18:26.867 --> 00:18:29.700
and everything was just. uh.
out of control.

433
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.367
Yeah. no. no. I could see

434
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.734
how a fly could get things
out of hand.

435
00:18:38.233 --> 00:18:39.500
Question. uh...

436
00:18:39.633 --> 00:18:42.867
you do have a crate
for Sam. right?

437
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.533
Didn't know I needed one.

438
00:18:44.667 --> 00:18:46.934
Was that also in
the adoption papers?

439
00:18:47.066 --> 00:18:48.667
Uh. it's not.
but it's a good thing to have.

440
00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.533
Really. most dogs learn
to love their crate--

441
00:18:50.667 --> 00:18:52.200
a place for them to go
where they don't get into

442
00:18:52.333 --> 00:18:53.667
any. uh...

443
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.433
you know... trouble.

444
00:18:56.567 --> 00:18:59.266
- Got it.
- Yeah.

445
00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.633
I see you work at Merils?

446
00:19:00.767 --> 00:19:03.100
Right! Yeah. I do.

447
00:19:03.233 --> 00:19:06.233
Were you on your way in?

448
00:19:06.367 --> 00:19:07.967
Because I won't keep you long.

449
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.667
Actually. I was planning
to stay home.

450
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.300
you know.
be here to keep Sam company.

451
00:19:12.433 --> 00:19:13.433
Sam. no!

452
00:19:13.567 --> 00:19:15.266
Sam! No! Sam. out of that!

453
00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.433
Sam. here. Hey. Sit.

454
00:19:17.567 --> 00:19:19.333
Good boy. Good boy.

455
00:19:20.567 --> 00:19:21.834
What did you just do
right there?

456
00:19:21.967 --> 00:19:24.800
Oh. Well.
when Sam's focus was on me.

457
00:19:24.934 --> 00:19:26.066
I praised him.

458
00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.767
That way.
whenever you say his name.

459
00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.667
he'll immediately focus on you.
no matter what he's doing.

460
00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.600
Huh!

461
00:19:30.734 --> 00:19:32.100
Yeah.

462
00:19:32.233 --> 00:19:33.800
So you're a trainer?

463
00:19:33.934 --> 00:19:35.133
Oh. no.
I've just learned a lot

464
00:19:35.266 --> 00:19:36.834
from working with dogs
over the years.

465
00:19:37.867 --> 00:19:39.000
Well. I couldn't. say.

466
00:19:39.133 --> 00:19:41.300
hire you to train Sam?

467
00:19:42.233 --> 00:19:43.467
No. sorry.

468
00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.266
But. um.
just for your reference.

469
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.000
it's really the owner
that gets the training.

470
00:19:49.133 --> 00:19:49.934
Well. that's perfect.

471
00:19:50.066 --> 00:19:52.066
because I would be
the model student.

472
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.133
and I would be happy
to pay you

473
00:19:53.266 --> 00:19:55.233
whatever it is
that you wanted to charge me.

474
00:19:55.367 --> 00:19:56.300
I'm sorry.
but I'm sure you can find

475
00:19:56.433 --> 00:19:58.767
an actual trainer to help you
and this guy.

476
00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:00.467
You hear that. Sam?

477
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:01.900
Because. although I miss you.

478
00:20:02.033 --> 00:20:04.967
this is your new home now.
all right?

479
00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.133
So you're gonna have to be
a good boy.

480
00:20:07.266 --> 00:20:11.967
Well. uh. everything here
seems to be in...

481
00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:13.800
some kind of order.
so. uh...

482
00:20:13.934 --> 00:20:15.767
I'm sure I won't need
to come back again.

483
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.834
Unless. of course. uh...

484
00:20:19.967 --> 00:20:23.000
you wanted to come back
and say "hi" to Sam or whatever.

485
00:20:23.133 --> 00:20:24.900
Thank you. but...

486
00:20:25.033 --> 00:20:27.700
I find it's easier
just to say goodbye.

487
00:20:29.033 --> 00:20:30.667
But. uh. good luck.

488
00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.467
and. seriously. get that crate--

489
00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:36.433
I'm sure the flies to be...
much less destructive.

490
00:20:49.633 --> 00:20:51.667
All right. Sam.

491
00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.266
please go inside
your cozy den.

492
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.967
Go inside.

493
00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:57.133
Go inside...

494
00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.000
Um. okay. Sam.
I need you to be good

495
00:21:03.133 --> 00:21:04.567
for ten minutes--
ten minutes!

496
00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.633
Please?

497
00:21:13.934 --> 00:21:15.700
Kyra! There you are.

498
00:21:15.834 --> 00:21:17.300
Mark told me that you were
staying home today.

499
00:21:17.433 --> 00:21:18.467
Is everything okay?

500
00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.133
Oh. um. everything is fine.

501
00:21:21.266 --> 00:21:26.000
I just had a few personal things
that I had to. uh. deal with.

502
00:21:26.133 --> 00:21:28.633
but. hey. why don't
we talk dog food.

503
00:21:28.767 --> 00:21:31.200
since we are both
such big dog lovers?

504
00:21:31.333 --> 00:21:32.700
I know you mentioned

505
00:21:32.834 --> 00:21:35.000
that you couldn't bring
your dog inside the store.

506
00:21:35.133 --> 00:21:37.667
so why don't
we bring the brand out?

507
00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.900
We could set up an outdoor
doggie drinking station.

508
00:21:41.033 --> 00:21:43.467
We could give away
treat samples

509
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.166
for owners to try
or take home.

510
00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.400
Wow! You really know
how to check off all the boxes.

511
00:21:49.967 --> 00:21:51.367
So do you.

512
00:21:52.333 --> 00:21:55.467
I mean... you-- I'm sure
that you are able to check off

513
00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.467
all the boxes that you need to.
as well.

514
00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.300
Uh...

515
00:22:00.433 --> 00:22:01.367
Oh. that must be him--

516
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.266
the wonder dog
I can't wait to see in action

517
00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.600
with his equally brilliant
owner?

518
00:22:05.734 --> 00:22:08.767
That is us--
the dynamic duo.

519
00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.500
Okay. Sam. time to meet
some trainers.

520
00:22:18.367 --> 00:22:19.867
Training dogs
is like training soldiers--

521
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:20.900
it takes discipline!

522
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.200
To communicate
with your animal.

523
00:22:25.333 --> 00:22:27.467
you have to speak
their language.

524
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:28.467
Hmm.

525
00:22:33.567 --> 00:22:35.400
Mm...

526
00:22:35.533 --> 00:22:40.433
aura--
it's all about the auras.

527
00:22:40.567 --> 00:22:42.033
Uh... huh.

528
00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:45.900
Wow. Um. thank you.

529
00:22:46.033 --> 00:22:49.233
Trust me. this always works.

530
00:22:55.834 --> 00:22:57.233
It's okay.

531
00:22:57.367 --> 00:22:59.266
A-woo. ooh!

532
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.533
Please. join.

533
00:23:00.667 --> 00:23:03.800
A-woo-oo-oo... ooh?

534
00:23:03.934 --> 00:23:04.834
Woo-ooh?

535
00:23:04.967 --> 00:23:06.333
Ow-woo.

536
00:23:11.934 --> 00:23:13.300
How's the training going?

537
00:23:13.433 --> 00:23:14.567
It's not.

538
00:23:16.166 --> 00:23:18.200
I didn't connect
with any of the trainers.

539
00:23:18.333 --> 00:23:19.734
And I read that smart dogs

540
00:23:19.867 --> 00:23:22.133
need the mental stimulation
of training.

541
00:23:22.266 --> 00:23:23.300
or else they get bored.

542
00:23:23.433 --> 00:23:24.800
and after being cooped up
at that shelter for so long.

543
00:23:24.934 --> 00:23:27.066
I just want to do
what's best for Sam.

544
00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.867
Not to mention
you want Trevor.

545
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.767
Yeah. well. that too.
of course.

546
00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:34.934
Well. I'm sure you'll find
a trainer you connect with.

547
00:23:36.266 --> 00:23:37.533
Yeah. that's the thing.

548
00:23:37.667 --> 00:23:41.233
I think
maybe Sam and I already have.

549
00:23:47.734 --> 00:23:50.600
Knock-knock? It's me!

550
00:23:50.734 --> 00:23:52.467
Don't worry.
I'm not here to bring Sam back.

551
00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:54.400
Is everything okay?

552
00:23:54.533 --> 00:23:56.734
Yeah... everything is great.

553
00:23:57.834 --> 00:23:58.867
I mean...

554
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.333
not really.

555
00:24:00.467 --> 00:24:01.800
I mean. I'll be lucky

556
00:24:01.934 --> 00:24:03.467
if there's not
another small disaster

557
00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.600
by the time I get home.

558
00:24:04.734 --> 00:24:05.834
Did you get a crate?

559
00:24:05.967 --> 00:24:09.667
I did. I got a wire one.
which Sam refused to go inside.

560
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.867
so I got a soft. padded one.
which he would go inside.

561
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.533
but he would not
stop barking in.

562
00:24:14.667 --> 00:24:16.700
so now I have one that's shaped
like a little house.

563
00:24:16.834 --> 00:24:18.867
and I even took the time to draw
little pictures for the inside.

564
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:19.934
for ambience.

565
00:24:20.066 --> 00:24:22.033
but no. it's a no-go.

566
00:24:22.166 --> 00:24:23.867
Yeah. it sounds like
he might be suffering

567
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.033
from some separation anxiety.

568
00:24:25.166 --> 00:24:26.467
Huh.

569
00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.767
So you're saying

570
00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:31.633
the crates are reminding him
of the fact that I'm leaving.

571
00:24:31.767 --> 00:24:33.200
Exactly.

572
00:24:33.333 --> 00:24:34.667
That makes total sense.

573
00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.433
And even more amazing
is the fact

574
00:24:36.567 --> 00:24:39.166
that none of the trainers
I talked to picked up on it.

575
00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:43.700
And that is exactly why
you are the man for the job!

576
00:24:43.834 --> 00:24:45.266
I'm sorry. okay?
I already told you.

577
00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.800
I just.
I don't have the time--

578
00:24:46.934 --> 00:24:50.367
I know. I know. I know.
you are not an official trainer.

579
00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.000
but I am begging you--

580
00:24:52.133 --> 00:24:55.367
because you are right.
Sam is super-smart.

581
00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.300
and a dog like that needs
major mental stimulation.

582
00:24:58.433 --> 00:25:00.233
kind of like
the agility training

583
00:25:00.367 --> 00:25:01.233
that I was talking about.

584
00:25:01.367 --> 00:25:02.500
but the problem is.

585
00:25:02.633 --> 00:25:03.934
I don't even know
basic training.

586
00:25:04.066 --> 00:25:06.600
And...

587
00:25:06.734 --> 00:25:09.333
I was honest in that
I don't want to give up on Sam.

588
00:25:09.467 --> 00:25:12.033
but I just need
a little bit of help.

589
00:25:12.166 --> 00:25:14.000
So what do you say?

590
00:25:14.133 --> 00:25:16.767
Please?
Will you help me and Sam?

591
00:25:18.467 --> 00:25:20.066
You have to take
some responsibility

592
00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.700
for letting me adopt him.

593
00:25:21.834 --> 00:25:23.433
I mean. I know I can be
very convincing. but...

594
00:25:23.567 --> 00:25:24.767
All right. fine.

595
00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.700
I'll run you
through some basics.

596
00:25:26.834 --> 00:25:28.000
Thank you!
Thank you. thank you. thank you.

597
00:25:28.133 --> 00:25:29.667
And like I said.
I will be a model student.

598
00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.100
Great. Sit.

599
00:25:31.233 --> 00:25:32.834
Okay.

600
00:25:32.967 --> 00:25:33.867
Now stay.
and I'll grab my keys.

601
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:34.800
Won't go anywhere.

602
00:25:39.834 --> 00:25:41.033
Not bad.

603
00:25:41.166 --> 00:25:42.300
What?

604
00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:44.166
Oh...

605
00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.100
"Sit. stay."

606
00:25:46.233 --> 00:25:47.400
Yeah. sorry.
I couldn't resist.

607
00:25:47.533 --> 00:25:48.734
Very funny.

608
00:25:48.867 --> 00:25:50.767
Well. in that case.
I want my treat.

609
00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:52.567
That's a good one.

610
00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.200
I was serious.
I am very hungry.

611
00:25:55.333 --> 00:25:57.700
so maybe after we pick up Sam.
we could pick up something.

612
00:25:57.834 --> 00:25:59.867
like a taco?

613
00:26:03.433 --> 00:26:05.667
So. the easiest way
to train your dog

614
00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.667
is by using the tastiest treats
that you can find.

615
00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.834
- Hmm.
- Assuming. of course.

616
00:26:10.967 --> 00:26:12.400
that your dog
is food-motivated.

617
00:26:12.533 --> 00:26:15.633
which. from the way that Sam
keeps eyeballing your taco--

618
00:26:18.066 --> 00:26:19.467
You have some... uh--

619
00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:22.333
a little...

620
00:26:23.533 --> 00:26:24.433
Oh.

621
00:26:24.567 --> 00:26:26.500
Uh... got it!

622
00:26:26.633 --> 00:26:29.633
Now. always make sure that
you have some treats on hand.

623
00:26:29.767 --> 00:26:32.567
That way. you can
reward Sam right away.

624
00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:33.867
so he makes the association.

625
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.767
Now. a lot of previous owners
already trained their dogs.

626
00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.667
so let's see
if that's the case with Sam.

627
00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.600
Sam... sit.

628
00:26:43.266 --> 00:26:45.400
Sam. down.

629
00:26:45.533 --> 00:26:47.467
Paw?

630
00:26:48.934 --> 00:26:50.667
- Good boy!
- Look at that!

631
00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:51.767
It's like
he's already fully trained.

632
00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:53.667
Yeah. I'd say
he's pretty advanced. actually.

633
00:26:55.367 --> 00:26:56.433
Then why's
he acting out so much?

634
00:26:56.567 --> 00:26:59.300
Because even the most
well-trained dogs will act out

635
00:26:59.433 --> 00:27:01.333
if they're suffering
from some emotional issues--

636
00:27:01.467 --> 00:27:02.900
like the separation anxiety.

637
00:27:03.033 --> 00:27:05.033
But. don't worry.
if you gain his trust

638
00:27:05.166 --> 00:27:06.800
by showing him
that you're always coming back

639
00:27:06.934 --> 00:27:08.133
if you leave.

640
00:27:08.266 --> 00:27:10.133
then he'll let it go.

641
00:27:10.266 --> 00:27:12.100
Now. let's see
how he behaves with you.

642
00:27:13.266 --> 00:27:15.166
That might be
a bit of a problem.

643
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:17.200
How so?

644
00:27:20.266 --> 00:27:21.867
Whoa! Sam! No!

645
00:27:22.967 --> 00:27:24.333
Got it.

646
00:27:25.266 --> 00:27:26.200
- Sam!
- Here. Here. here.

647
00:27:26.333 --> 00:27:28.400
I got it. I got it.
I got it.

648
00:27:28.533 --> 00:27:30.567
Hey. Hey.

649
00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.533
It's like doing the Iditarod
every time.

650
00:27:33.667 --> 00:27:36.200
Yeah. You can't let him lead.
is the thing.

651
00:27:36.333 --> 00:27:37.467
- Right.
- Watch.

652
00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.066
Sam? Walk.

653
00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.500
Just like that.

654
00:27:46.633 --> 00:27:50.200
So. every time Sam pulls.
you tell him to sit. stay.

655
00:27:50.333 --> 00:27:52.166
and then you walk again. Okay?

656
00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:53.800
Okay. Ahem.

657
00:27:53.934 --> 00:27:55.433
Okay. Sam?

658
00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:59.200
Walk.

659
00:28:00.867 --> 00:28:02.967
And walk.

660
00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:04.867
And sit!

661
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.400
Well. look at that--
he's really getting it.

662
00:28:06.533 --> 00:28:08.867
Well. actually.
you're really getting it.

663
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.133
Right. because
you are not only training him.

664
00:28:11.266 --> 00:28:12.433
you are also training me.

665
00:28:12.567 --> 00:28:14.233
Tch. There you go.

666
00:28:14.367 --> 00:28:15.633
So. because
this is going so well.

667
00:28:15.767 --> 00:28:18.633
do you think that
Sam could be agility-trained?

668
00:28:18.767 --> 00:28:21.600
I have no doubt that Sam
could be agility-trained.

669
00:28:21.734 --> 00:28:24.900
but it takes a lot of dedication
and motivation

670
00:28:25.033 --> 00:28:26.266
to get a dog to that level.

671
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.633
Oh. I am motivated.

672
00:28:27.767 --> 00:28:29.633
Yeah. I can see that.

673
00:28:29.767 --> 00:28:31.066
Why?

674
00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.734
Because...

675
00:28:32.867 --> 00:28:35.367
I may have exaggerated a wee bit

676
00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.934
about how smart Sam is.

677
00:28:37.066 --> 00:28:38.700
and because Merils
is sponsoring it.

678
00:28:38.834 --> 00:28:40.233
we have been entered

679
00:28:40.367 --> 00:28:42.700
as contestants
into an agility show.

680
00:28:42.834 --> 00:28:44.967
Whoa. whoa. whoa. wait.

681
00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:46.633
Not the Superpups show?

682
00:28:46.767 --> 00:28:48.133
- That's the one.
- Oh...

683
00:28:48.266 --> 00:28:50.066
No. no. it's...
I mean. I know.

684
00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.467
it's a little crazy.

685
00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.633
but you said it yourself--

686
00:28:52.767 --> 00:28:54.266
Sam is very smart.

687
00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.967
so this could be
an opportunity

688
00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:59.233
for him to work
that big brain of his.

689
00:28:59.367 --> 00:29:02.033
Again. I have no doubt
that Sam could handle it--

690
00:29:02.166 --> 00:29:04.000
Really? That's great.
When can we start?

691
00:29:04.133 --> 00:29:06.533
I am off Saturday.
Thursday after 3:00...

692
00:29:06.667 --> 00:29:07.867
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.
I didn't say

693
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.467
that I would help you
agility-train Sam.

694
00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.633
But this. us--
all of this has been so great.

695
00:29:14.767 --> 00:29:18.033
Yeah. it went
relatively smoothly.

696
00:29:18.166 --> 00:29:20.033
and now I can feel good
about the adoption.

697
00:29:20.166 --> 00:29:22.367
knowing that you know how
to manage Sam moving forward.

698
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:26.967
Well. I guess we will just
have to carry on to greatness

699
00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:28.533
without you.

700
00:29:28.667 --> 00:29:29.834
Nice try.

701
00:29:29.967 --> 00:29:31.800
Is it working?

702
00:29:31.934 --> 00:29:33.133
Huh?

703
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.500
I'll think about it. okay?

704
00:29:36.633 --> 00:29:38.800
Great! Because I know
you are the best one

705
00:29:38.934 --> 00:29:40.700
to train Sam--
and me. of course.

706
00:29:40.834 --> 00:29:42.667
Okay. okay. I said
I'd think about it.

707
00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.967
Just so you know. the show is
coming up in a couple of weeks--

708
00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.467
- no pressure. of course.
- Right.

709
00:29:48.967 --> 00:29:52.700
Well. I need to get back
to the shelter. but. um...

710
00:29:54.433 --> 00:29:55.667
I will be in touch.

711
00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.367
Um. don't wait too long.

712
00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.166
Because. you know.
it's a couple weeks!

713
00:30:07.266 --> 00:30:09.266
He'll be back.

714
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.200
I think.

715
00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:19.266
Good. Sam. Good.

716
00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.700
Oh. hey. Kev.

717
00:30:26.834 --> 00:30:27.900
Brought you some leftovers.

718
00:30:28.033 --> 00:30:29.300
John's away on business

719
00:30:29.433 --> 00:30:31.300
and there is no way
I'm gonna finish them all.

720
00:30:31.433 --> 00:30:32.300
which is good.

721
00:30:32.433 --> 00:30:34.200
because your fridge
is seriously empty.

722
00:30:34.333 --> 00:30:36.867
I swear. Mom dropped the ball
by not teaching you how to cook.

723
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.033
It's only empty

724
00:30:38.166 --> 00:30:41.000
because I've been
busier than usual.

725
00:30:41.133 --> 00:30:42.567
Oh. shelter getting full?

726
00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:45.700
That. and. you know.
I'm just keeping busy.

727
00:30:45.834 --> 00:30:49.533
And just today I was helping
someone train their dog.

728
00:30:49.667 --> 00:30:50.700
Really?

729
00:30:50.834 --> 00:30:51.767
Who?

730
00:30:52.867 --> 00:30:54.834
Just this woman. Kyra.

731
00:30:54.967 --> 00:30:56.667
She came in to the shelter
looking for a dog.

732
00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:59.633
and I honestly wasn't even
going to let her adopt. but...

733
00:30:59.767 --> 00:31:00.767
But?

734
00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.567
But I don't know.

735
00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:06.200
What she said.
she just seemed so sincere.

736
00:31:06.333 --> 00:31:08.266
and I got the feeling
she wouldn't give up. so.

737
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.433
Wow.

738
00:31:09.567 --> 00:31:13.300
You never let emotion
get in the way of adoptions.

739
00:31:13.433 --> 00:31:16.133
It wasn't emotional. okay?
It was just my gut.

740
00:31:16.266 --> 00:31:17.200
Your gut-- same thing.

741
00:31:17.333 --> 00:31:19.133
So? Was your gut right?

742
00:31:19.266 --> 00:31:20.800
Yeah. I think so.

743
00:31:20.934 --> 00:31:22.367
Great! I mean. it's great

744
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:25.300
that you're having
a little human interaction.

745
00:31:25.433 --> 00:31:27.133
plus. I think you would make
an excellent trainer.

746
00:31:27.266 --> 00:31:29.266
I just gave her
a few tips.

747
00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.900
and now she's gonna have
to find someone else.

748
00:31:31.033 --> 00:31:32.767
Why? Why?

749
00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:34.600
Because I'm happy
doing what I do.

750
00:31:34.734 --> 00:31:36.133
Look. Kev.

751
00:31:36.266 --> 00:31:38.567
You've done an amazing thing
with that shelter.

752
00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:39.800
you really have.
but you can't just

753
00:31:39.934 --> 00:31:42.367
spend your entire life
surrounded by dogs and animals.

754
00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.633
There are
some good people out there

755
00:31:44.767 --> 00:31:46.967
and I think a good start

756
00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:50.166
would be helping this Kyra girl
train her dog.

757
00:31:54.867 --> 00:31:56.834
I'll think about it.

758
00:32:01.467 --> 00:32:02.967
Hi. Mom!

759
00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:04.633
How's the European tour going?

760
00:32:04.767 --> 00:32:06.166
It's spectacular.

761
00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:08.266
Honestly. I haven't felt
this alive in ages.

762
00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.000
so thank you
for pushing me to go.

763
00:32:10.133 --> 00:32:12.000
Mom. that is so great.

764
00:32:12.133 --> 00:32:14.767
Oh. uh... you'll never guess.

765
00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:16.333
I got a dog.

766
00:32:16.467 --> 00:32:17.934
A dog?

767
00:32:18.066 --> 00:32:19.667
I didn't know
that was in your plans.

768
00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.633
Oh. it wasn't.

769
00:32:21.767 --> 00:32:23.300
but it is kind of tied to them.

770
00:32:23.433 --> 00:32:25.266
See. the new store manager. Mom.

771
00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.700
he is. like. perfect

772
00:32:26.834 --> 00:32:29.500
and he is a dog-lover. so...

773
00:32:29.633 --> 00:32:30.867
I see.

774
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.266
Well. he must be perfect

775
00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.934
for you to go to such measures
and get a dog.

776
00:32:34.066 --> 00:32:35.934
Oh. he is.

777
00:32:36.066 --> 00:32:39.133
He is loyal. dependable...

778
00:32:39.266 --> 00:32:40.867
Trevor is nothing like Dad.

779
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.500
Right...

780
00:32:42.633 --> 00:32:45.033
well. just remember. sweetheart.

781
00:32:45.166 --> 00:32:46.834
no one's perfect.

782
00:32:46.967 --> 00:32:49.100
Hmm.

783
00:32:49.233 --> 00:32:50.834
Oh. I'm sorry.
but I should go.

784
00:32:50.967 --> 00:32:53.600
I've got a river cruise
in 30 minutes with Valentin.

785
00:32:53.734 --> 00:32:55.467
but we'll talk again
in a few days.

786
00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.800
Valentin?

787
00:32:56.934 --> 00:32:58.300
Valentin! Mom?

788
00:32:58.433 --> 00:32:59.433
I love you. sweetheart!

789
00:32:59.567 --> 00:33:00.934
Talk to you soon.

790
00:33:09.667 --> 00:33:10.500
Guess who's doing

791
00:33:10.633 --> 00:33:12.500
the announcing
for the Superpups show?

792
00:33:12.633 --> 00:33:14.033
Yours truly!

793
00:33:15.233 --> 00:33:17.900
"And now
for our next dynamic duo--

794
00:33:18.033 --> 00:33:20.200
Kyra and her Superpup!"

795
00:33:21.734 --> 00:33:22.767
Mark!

796
00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.600
That's so great.

797
00:33:24.734 --> 00:33:26.533
Now I just have to get a handle
on this whole agility thing.

798
00:33:26.667 --> 00:33:27.533
Right.

799
00:33:27.667 --> 00:33:29.400
Maybe you can just
tell Trevor that you--

800
00:33:29.533 --> 00:33:32.934
I mean. "we" may have
exaggerated just a bit.

801
00:33:33.066 --> 00:33:34.934
Yeah. Really?

802
00:33:35.066 --> 00:33:36.066
Can I?

803
00:33:40.033 --> 00:33:41.367
Oh.

804
00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:43.266
- Yeah.
- Wow.

805
00:33:44.867 --> 00:33:47.000
Yes. absolutely...

806
00:33:47.133 --> 00:33:49.500
Kyra! Hey!

807
00:33:49.633 --> 00:33:51.500
- Hey!
- Isn't it great?

808
00:33:51.633 --> 00:33:52.333
Yeah!

809
00:33:52.467 --> 00:33:54.400
Sure is.

810
00:33:54.533 --> 00:33:55.400
You and Sparky
must be so excited.

811
00:33:55.533 --> 00:33:58.934
Oh... yeah. we. um.
really. really are.

812
00:33:59.066 --> 00:34:00.133
Well. I'm just

813
00:34:00.266 --> 00:34:01.900
on my way to grab
some sandwiches from Stefano's.

814
00:34:02.033 --> 00:34:03.800
- Can I get you one?
- Actually. I'm okay.

815
00:34:03.934 --> 00:34:06.500
I brought
my own gluten-free bars.

816
00:34:06.633 --> 00:34:08.633
Actually. do you want one?

817
00:34:08.767 --> 00:34:09.967
Because I have to warn you.

818
00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:13.000
Stefano's does not have
a gluten-free option.

819
00:34:13.133 --> 00:34:14.934
That's okay.
Today's not my gluten-free day.

820
00:34:15.066 --> 00:34:16.800
Oh. "Day"?

821
00:34:16.934 --> 00:34:18.233
So...

822
00:34:18.367 --> 00:34:21.667
you're not actually gluten-free.
or...?

823
00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:22.834
Just on Thursdays.

824
00:34:22.967 --> 00:34:26.000
And then. on Tuesdays.
I am faithfully vegetarian.

825
00:34:26.133 --> 00:34:28.000
and on Monday. Wednesdays.
and Fridays.

826
00:34:28.133 --> 00:34:31.300
I am loyal to that Reuben on rye
at Stefano's.

827
00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.066
So enjoy.
and I'll see you after lunch.

828
00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.400
Great.

829
00:34:36.533 --> 00:34:38.367
Sure.

830
00:34:41.567 --> 00:34:43.233
So. uncheck "gluten-free."

831
00:34:43.367 --> 00:34:45.233
Is that a deal-breaker?

832
00:34:45.367 --> 00:34:47.734
No. No. no. no. No. No.

833
00:34:47.867 --> 00:34:51.667
No. because he still checks off
everything else on the list.

834
00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.900
You know? The important things.

835
00:34:58.100 --> 00:34:59.100
Uh-oh.

836
00:34:59.233 --> 00:35:00.400
What?

837
00:35:00.533 --> 00:35:02.033
It's the guy from the shelter.

838
00:35:02.166 --> 00:35:04.066
Could you just watch
the customers for me? Great.

839
00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:06.000
- Hi!
- Hey.

840
00:35:06.133 --> 00:35:09.667
Wow. So. this is. uh...
really happening. huh?

841
00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.033
Uh. sure is.
Full-steam ahead.

842
00:35:12.166 --> 00:35:13.700
Right.

843
00:35:13.834 --> 00:35:15.700
So. uh. look.

844
00:35:15.834 --> 00:35:20.333
If you and Sam still
need someone to train you.

845
00:35:20.467 --> 00:35:24.367
then. uh. I would be willing
to take you on as clients.

846
00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:25.500
Really?

847
00:35:25.633 --> 00:35:26.500
Yeah.

848
00:35:26.633 --> 00:35:28.467
That would be so great!

849
00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:31.200
Ah! Sam and I are. like.
the luckiest human and dog ever!

850
00:35:32.533 --> 00:35:34.166
Who's Sam?

851
00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:39.667
Sam is my dog... obviously!

852
00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.834
Thought your dog's name
was "Sparky".

853
00:35:41.967 --> 00:35:45.033
Uh. yes... it is.

854
00:35:45.166 --> 00:35:47.834
That is the nickname
that I gave him...

855
00:35:47.967 --> 00:35:50.066
because he is so smart.
you know?

856
00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.800
Like. a lightbulb.
Like. bing-bing-bing-bing!

857
00:35:52.934 --> 00:35:54.200
Like a... like a...

858
00:35:54.333 --> 00:35:55.700
Oh.

859
00:35:55.834 --> 00:35:58.400
Um. just to avoid confusion
in training.

860
00:35:58.533 --> 00:36:01.567
you should really refer to him
by just one name only.

861
00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:03.467
"Training"?

862
00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:07.300
Yeah. Lara. well. you know
what dogs are like--

863
00:36:07.433 --> 00:36:09.233
the training never stops.

864
00:36:12.867 --> 00:36:15.066
And...
are you the trainer?

865
00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.867
Oh. my gosh!

866
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.700
Lara. did you just
post a new picture

867
00:36:18.834 --> 00:36:19.900
on Antoinette's Insta page?

868
00:36:20.033 --> 00:36:20.767
I did. actually.

869
00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:23.033
It is a-maz-ing!

870
00:36:23.166 --> 00:36:24.600
So many likes!

871
00:36:24.734 --> 00:36:26.133
Oh. my gosh. really?
Let me see!

872
00:36:27.867 --> 00:36:30.100
Um... well.

873
00:36:30.233 --> 00:36:32.133
You know what?

874
00:36:33.667 --> 00:36:36.133
Why don't we just take
some of these treats

875
00:36:36.266 --> 00:36:37.233
and get started?

876
00:36:37.367 --> 00:36:39.300
Right now?
Don't you have to...

877
00:36:39.433 --> 00:36:40.633
I don't know. work?

878
00:36:40.767 --> 00:36:42.800
Nah. I can knock off
a few hours early

879
00:36:42.934 --> 00:36:43.900
for the sake of the show.

880
00:36:44.033 --> 00:36:45.567
Okay. yeah. I mean.
I guess I don't need to be

881
00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:48.133
back at the shelter
for a few hours. so...

882
00:36:48.266 --> 00:36:49.300
Perfect.

883
00:36:49.433 --> 00:36:51.133
Mark. can you cover for me?

884
00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.633
Thank you.

885
00:36:53.767 --> 00:36:54.800
All right. let's go.

886
00:36:54.934 --> 00:36:57.800
Okay. You are already
on your way.

887
00:37:03.667 --> 00:37:06.467
All right.
let's get some of those treats

888
00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.233
into this pouch here
and we'll get started.

889
00:37:09.967 --> 00:37:10.900
Oh.

890
00:37:11.033 --> 00:37:12.166
Like that.

891
00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:14.133
There. So it doesn't...

892
00:37:14.266 --> 00:37:16.533
slide off.

893
00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:20.467
Yeah. Just like that.
That looks great.

894
00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.633
Okay. so first things first.

895
00:37:22.767 --> 00:37:25.166
You're gonna want to get
Sam's full attention on you.

896
00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:26.734
- So. grab a treat.
- Right.

897
00:37:26.867 --> 00:37:28.834
Okay.

898
00:37:29.867 --> 00:37:32.200
Sam... sit.

899
00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:34.233
Good boy!

900
00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:37.500
Uh...

901
00:37:37.633 --> 00:37:38.834
That's weird.

902
00:37:38.967 --> 00:37:41.567
The box of new treats
says "irresistible".

903
00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:44.133
Huh. He must not be hungry.

904
00:37:44.266 --> 00:37:45.734
Arf!

905
00:37:45.867 --> 00:37:47.900
Or maybe
he just doesn't like them.

906
00:37:48.033 --> 00:37:49.667
I know!

907
00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.166
I'll try
one of my gluten-free bars.

908
00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:52.934
Uh... 'kay.

909
00:37:55.133 --> 00:37:56.967
Okay.

910
00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:58.533
Woof!

911
00:37:58.667 --> 00:38:01.033
Sam. sit.

912
00:38:01.166 --> 00:38:02.967
Good boy!

913
00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:04.567
Oh. look at that!
I think he likes it.

914
00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:05.633
Huh.

915
00:38:05.767 --> 00:38:07.433
Here. let's try this again.

916
00:38:07.567 --> 00:38:08.467
Here.

917
00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.400
We'll use it
to lead him around the cones.

918
00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:12.433
Come on.

919
00:38:12.567 --> 00:38:13.567
Oh. good boy!

920
00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:15.467
That's it!

921
00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:18.033
Around here. Around here.
There you go! Good boy.

922
00:38:18.166 --> 00:38:18.967
This is working great!

923
00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:21.934
- Huh!
- Great!

924
00:38:22.066 --> 00:38:23.700
Except that was my last one.

925
00:38:23.834 --> 00:38:25.633
I guess I'll have to make
a whole whack more.

926
00:38:25.767 --> 00:38:27.300
You made these?

927
00:38:27.433 --> 00:38:29.533
Yeah! It's my very own recipe.

928
00:38:29.667 --> 00:38:30.867
Maybe I could
get that from you.

929
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.066
Sure. why?
Are you gluten-free or...?

930
00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:34.400
I am. actually.

931
00:38:34.533 --> 00:38:36.533
When I was a kid.
I would get these rashes

932
00:38:36.667 --> 00:38:37.533
every time I ate wheat.

933
00:38:37.667 --> 00:38:39.633
I know exactly
what you're talking about.

934
00:38:39.767 --> 00:38:40.633
Those rashes are the worst!

935
00:38:40.767 --> 00:38:41.533
I know!

936
00:38:41.667 --> 00:38:43.300
Between that
and the stutter I had.

937
00:38:43.433 --> 00:38:44.934
it didn't help
my popularity any.

938
00:38:45.066 --> 00:38:46.266
Huh.

939
00:38:47.767 --> 00:38:49.734
If you've got some time.

940
00:38:49.867 --> 00:38:52.467
we could go inside
and make some more.

941
00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:56.100
Uh. actually. you probably have
to get back to the shelter.

942
00:38:56.233 --> 00:38:58.967
Well. I-- my assistant
is actually there today.

943
00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:01.367
so. it should be okay.

944
00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:04.233
Except I have to warn you.
I'm not the best in the kitchen.

945
00:39:05.333 --> 00:39:07.867
Perfect.

946
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.700
Now I can teach you something.

947
00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.166
Sam? Wanna come in?

948
00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:13.834
I don't think so.

949
00:39:13.967 --> 00:39:15.500
Okay.

950
00:39:16.734 --> 00:39:17.900
Okay. so.

951
00:39:18.033 --> 00:39:21.266
it will just take me a second
to get all the ingredients.

952
00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:22.533
Okay.

953
00:39:22.667 --> 00:39:25.700
Wow. It's much tidier
than last time.

954
00:39:25.834 --> 00:39:27.934
I guess no more flies. huh?

955
00:39:28.066 --> 00:39:30.133
Come on.
you know that wasn't a fly.

956
00:39:30.266 --> 00:39:31.467
Maybe.

957
00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.667
Plus. you don't
strike me as the messy type.

958
00:39:36.233 --> 00:39:39.333
In fact.
you seem quite organized.

959
00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.133
In every aspect.

960
00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.600
Oh. Um...

961
00:39:49.734 --> 00:39:51.800
Yeah--

962
00:39:51.934 --> 00:39:55.967
That is just
a silly motivational...

963
00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:57.133
thing.

964
00:39:57.266 --> 00:39:58.367
Right.

965
00:39:58.500 --> 00:39:59.500
Why don't you help me
in the kitchen?

966
00:39:59.633 --> 00:40:01.100
Kitchen.

967
00:40:01.233 --> 00:40:03.700
Yeah.

968
00:40:03.834 --> 00:40:05.934
Okay! Uh. I will start off

969
00:40:06.066 --> 00:40:09.300
by getting you
to add some water--

970
00:40:09.433 --> 00:40:10.333
Okay.

971
00:40:10.467 --> 00:40:11.800
...some oats.

972
00:40:13.934 --> 00:40:15.367
Oats. 'Kay.

973
00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:16.500
I will get
the other ingredients.

974
00:40:16.633 --> 00:40:17.500
- Okay.
- Perfect.

975
00:40:17.633 --> 00:40:19.367
Nut butter will thicken it up.

976
00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:22.800
So do you have
a to-do list for Sam.

977
00:40:22.934 --> 00:40:24.300
to get him motivated
for the big show?

978
00:40:24.433 --> 00:40:25.834
Of course.

979
00:40:25.967 --> 00:40:29.133
He has to learn
to jump. weave. turn.

980
00:40:29.266 --> 00:40:30.200
Jump. weave. turn--

981
00:40:30.333 --> 00:40:31.867
well. you've really done
your agility homework.

982
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.867
Would you expect anything less?

983
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.934
No.

984
00:40:36.066 --> 00:40:37.800
Gotta put some elbow into that.

985
00:40:37.934 --> 00:40:39.700
- Elbow?
- Yeah.

986
00:40:42.133 --> 00:40:43.967
- Too much elbow.
- Perfect!

987
00:40:45.433 --> 00:40:48.633
Here. I'll add
the gluten-free peanut butter.

988
00:40:50.266 --> 00:40:51.333
Is it always this messy?

989
00:40:51.467 --> 00:40:53.100
No. actually. it's not!

990
00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:56.967
Gonna have to wash
my hands here.

991
00:41:05.567 --> 00:41:07.367
All right. that's it.

992
00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.934
Now... for the taste test.

993
00:41:10.066 --> 00:41:11.633
Hmm.

994
00:41:13.133 --> 00:41:15.400
Wow! Very funny.

995
00:41:16.633 --> 00:41:19.200
What? I thought this batch
was for Sam.

996
00:41:19.333 --> 00:41:22.433
Yeah. No. I see where I stand
on the. uh. totem pole here.

997
00:41:22.567 --> 00:41:24.567
Uh-oh.
What's Sam's getting into?

998
00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:26.400
What? Where?

999
00:41:26.533 --> 00:41:28.700
Oh. O-Okay. Very funny.

1000
00:41:28.834 --> 00:41:29.867
I see what you're doing--

1001
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.533
get the dog in trouble
so you could eat his treats.

1002
00:41:31.667 --> 00:41:32.700
Sorry. but these are good.

1003
00:41:32.834 --> 00:41:34.734
Really good!

1004
00:41:34.867 --> 00:41:35.834
Oh. what's Sam got?

1005
00:41:35.967 --> 00:41:37.667
You really think I'm gonna
fall for that again?

1006
00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:38.567
No. seriously.
What's in his mouth?

1007
00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:40.900
Sam.

1008
00:41:43.633 --> 00:41:46.233
I swear. he's obsessed
with my car keys.

1009
00:41:46.367 --> 00:41:47.900
Maybe he's trying to tell you
he wants to go for a car ride.

1010
00:41:49.133 --> 00:41:51.166
Sam?
Do you want to go for a ride?

1011
00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:52.567
Arf!

1012
00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:55.000
Well. great. now
I've gotten him all excited.

1013
00:41:55.133 --> 00:41:57.100
I'm game if you are.

1014
00:42:07.033 --> 00:42:08.900
How about this?

1015
00:42:09.033 --> 00:42:10.667
No plan
and look where we ended up.

1016
00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.266
Yeah. It really is beautiful.

1017
00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:17.567
Guess this is one of
those off-leash dog parks. huh?

1018
00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:19.300
Sure is.

1019
00:42:19.433 --> 00:42:21.100
And I think he knows it.

1020
00:42:21.233 --> 00:42:23.300
Okay. Sam. ready?

1021
00:42:24.367 --> 00:42:25.266
Go play!

1022
00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.734
- Go. go!
- Go. Sam!

1023
00:42:30.633 --> 00:42:32.433
You see.
this is what I love--

1024
00:42:32.567 --> 00:42:35.567
just dogs just being dogs.
you know?

1025
00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:36.900
Not a care in the world.

1026
00:42:37.033 --> 00:42:39.800
Must be pretty fun
to be a dog. huh?

1027
00:42:39.934 --> 00:42:42.633
Yeah. well. that's why
it's nice having a dog.

1028
00:42:42.767 --> 00:42:44.467
Because all the things
that are great

1029
00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:45.500
about being a dog.

1030
00:42:45.633 --> 00:42:46.767
they can teach us. you know?

1031
00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:49.133
Like just taking a moment
to play.

1032
00:42:49.266 --> 00:42:50.834
or enjoying a car ride.

1033
00:42:50.967 --> 00:42:51.867
like Sam just did.

1034
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.500
I mean. he didn't know
where we were going

1035
00:42:53.633 --> 00:42:54.800
or what the plan was.

1036
00:42:54.934 --> 00:42:57.600
he was just
living in the moment.

1037
00:42:57.734 --> 00:42:59.567
I mean. that would be great.

1038
00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:01.133
but the reality is.

1039
00:43:01.266 --> 00:43:03.300
we will never be
as carefree as dogs.

1040
00:43:03.433 --> 00:43:06.233
Oh...

1041
00:43:06.367 --> 00:43:09.567
I just think life is easier
if you have a plan.

1042
00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:10.667
because. if you don't.

1043
00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.133
then things just turn out...

1044
00:43:12.266 --> 00:43:14.166
not as planned.

1045
00:43:15.333 --> 00:43:17.066
Well. then
I guess the good news is

1046
00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.500
that. according
to your to-do list.

1047
00:43:19.633 --> 00:43:21.533
you seem to be well on track--

1048
00:43:21.667 --> 00:43:23.633
except for one thing.

1049
00:43:25.867 --> 00:43:27.967
Hey. look. if you are talking
about the "partner" thing.

1050
00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:29.967
that is not--

1051
00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:31.567
I was talking about Sam.

1052
00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:34.300
because I didn't see
"getting a dog" on there.

1053
00:43:34.433 --> 00:43:36.567
Right.

1054
00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:38.900
I mean. getting a dog
was a part of the plan.

1055
00:43:39.033 --> 00:43:40.900
it was just part of
a bigger plan.

1056
00:43:41.033 --> 00:43:41.934
Right.

1057
00:43:44.133 --> 00:43:46.133
Did you see that?

1058
00:43:46.266 --> 00:43:47.233
Um...

1059
00:43:47.367 --> 00:43:48.834
Hey. let's. uh.
let's try this.

1060
00:43:48.967 --> 00:43:50.166
Ooh.

1061
00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:52.200
All right. Sam. ready?

1062
00:43:52.333 --> 00:43:54.166
Ready? Go!

1063
00:43:55.967 --> 00:43:58.000
Oh! Good boy!

1064
00:43:58.133 --> 00:44:00.633
Oh. come on.
that was amazing!

1065
00:44:00.767 --> 00:44:02.533
Uh. he's definitely got
some Superpup in him.

1066
00:44:02.667 --> 00:44:03.767
That's right.

1067
00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:06.133
That is my Superpup.

1068
00:44:06.266 --> 00:44:07.600
Come on. Sam! Come on!

1069
00:44:07.734 --> 00:44:09.133
Bring it back. Bring it here.
Come on.

1070
00:44:09.266 --> 00:44:10.900
Come on. Bring it to me.
Bring it to me.

1071
00:44:11.033 --> 00:44:12.967
Pick it up.
Yeah! Good!

1072
00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:15.867
Good! Good. Sam.
Do you wanna go again? Okay.

1073
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:16.967
Try again. Ready?

1074
00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:19.000
Good... and go!

1075
00:44:20.266 --> 00:44:22.633
Good boy! Good boy.

1076
00:44:30.767 --> 00:44:33.533
Well. I guess we didn't really
get a lot of training in.

1077
00:44:33.667 --> 00:44:34.934
Ah. it's okay.

1078
00:44:35.066 --> 00:44:37.700
We'll. uh. make up for it
this weekend.

1079
00:44:37.834 --> 00:44:40.033
You know. maybe I'll set up
a proper course at my place

1080
00:44:40.166 --> 00:44:42.133
and then you can
bring Sam over there.

1081
00:44:42.266 --> 00:44:43.467
Great.

1082
00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:46.433
And then
I get to meet your dog--

1083
00:44:46.567 --> 00:44:49.433
or dogs. I'm assuming.

1084
00:44:49.567 --> 00:44:50.934
Uh. well. actually.
I don't have a dog.

1085
00:44:51.066 --> 00:44:52.033
But...

1086
00:44:52.166 --> 00:44:53.367
you're the dog guy!

1087
00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:55.033
How do you not have a dog?

1088
00:44:55.166 --> 00:44:57.633
I mean.
I had one growing up. but...

1089
00:44:58.834 --> 00:45:00.800
I mean. I guess now that I have
so many at the shelter.

1090
00:45:00.934 --> 00:45:03.033
every time I think about
bringing one home.

1091
00:45:03.166 --> 00:45:05.166
I start thinking that
I should bring them all home.

1092
00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:06.467
and...

1093
00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:07.467
it's just too hard.

1094
00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:10.300
Huh. Yeah. I mean. I get it.

1095
00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:12.333
Just so you know.

1096
00:45:12.467 --> 00:45:14.300
I think what you're doing
at the shelter--

1097
00:45:14.433 --> 00:45:16.100
finding these dogs
their forever homes--

1098
00:45:16.233 --> 00:45:18.166
is incredible.

1099
00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:22.300
Ah. they're
the incredible ones--

1100
00:45:22.433 --> 00:45:24.400
for giving us humans
another chance.

1101
00:45:25.433 --> 00:45:26.600
Hmm.

1102
00:45:29.467 --> 00:45:31.667
But. on that note.
I should get going.

1103
00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:33.467
I still need to pop
by the shelter.

1104
00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:36.500
So. uh. this weekend--
serious work?

1105
00:45:36.633 --> 00:45:38.166
- Serious work.
- Serious work.

1106
00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:40.567
See ya. Sam.

1107
00:45:44.633 --> 00:45:45.834
Bye-bye.

1108
00:46:01.934 --> 00:46:02.900
Hey!

1109
00:46:03.033 --> 00:46:04.467
- Hi!
- What do you think?

1110
00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:06.734
I mean. it's not
totally up to speed.

1111
00:46:06.867 --> 00:46:08.300
- but it's getting there.
- Okay. go play.

1112
00:46:08.433 --> 00:46:09.834
Oh. go. play.

1113
00:46:09.967 --> 00:46:14.567
Wow. This whole space
is perfect for dog training.

1114
00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:15.800
Yeah. I mean.
it's not why I moved here.

1115
00:46:15.934 --> 00:46:18.567
but I just kind of like
that it's tucked away. you know?

1116
00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:20.800
Even better. because then
the dogs can't bother anybody.

1117
00:46:20.934 --> 00:46:22.633
Yeah.

1118
00:46:22.767 --> 00:46:23.900
Kevin. you should
seriously consider this

1119
00:46:24.033 --> 00:46:24.834
as a side business.

1120
00:46:24.967 --> 00:46:26.834
But just not yet.

1121
00:46:26.967 --> 00:46:28.633
because I wouldn't want
to share you.

1122
00:46:28.767 --> 00:46:32.000
Right. Well. I don't
have any plans right now

1123
00:46:32.133 --> 00:46:33.467
to take on any more clients.
so--

1124
00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:34.734
Good!

1125
00:46:34.867 --> 00:46:36.467
Now. I did a little research

1126
00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:38.967
and this course
is fairly accurate.

1127
00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:40.934
but on a beginner scale.

1128
00:46:41.066 --> 00:46:43.500
That being said.
if I do...

1129
00:46:43.633 --> 00:46:45.166
this...

1130
00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:47.266
we can easily
adjust the difficulty.

1131
00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:48.633
I love it.

1132
00:46:48.767 --> 00:46:50.567
Yeah. Should we get
started with Sam?

1133
00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:51.367
Absolutely.

1134
00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:52.834
- Sam! Come on!
- Come on. Sam.

1135
00:46:52.967 --> 00:46:53.767
Come on. Come on.

1136
00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:55.100
- All right. Here we go.
- All right.

1137
00:46:55.233 --> 00:46:56.266
So. first thing you want to do.

1138
00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.600
you want to get Sam
to come around on your left--

1139
00:46:58.734 --> 00:46:59.800
- Right.
- ...As you start the course.

1140
00:46:59.934 --> 00:47:03.000
So... sit. Good.
But we want to go...

1141
00:47:03.133 --> 00:47:04.400
- come around...
- And around.

1142
00:47:04.533 --> 00:47:05.533
Sit.

1143
00:47:05.667 --> 00:47:06.867
And we're gonna jump--

1144
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.133
Whoo!

1145
00:47:08.266 --> 00:47:09.166
Good job!

1146
00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:11.667
And now we are going to--
what's the best way?

1147
00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:13.066
So the poles
are just like the cones.

1148
00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:15.166
You're just gonna want
to get him weaving through.

1149
00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:16.333
- Look at-- look at Kevin.
- Just like that.

1150
00:47:16.467 --> 00:47:17.533
- Look at Kevin.
- See that. Sam?

1151
00:47:17.667 --> 00:47:19.500
Just like that.

1152
00:47:19.633 --> 00:47:21.633
And then around...
and then around...

1153
00:47:21.767 --> 00:47:23.367
- Good boy!
- Good job. Good job.

1154
00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:25.033
- And around... and then sit.
- Here we go.

1155
00:47:25.166 --> 00:47:26.834
Good. Sam!

1156
00:47:26.967 --> 00:47:29.033
That was great!

1157
00:47:29.166 --> 00:47:30.166
Okay. so...

1158
00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:31.834
Okay. so next. you want to get
a lot of momentum.

1159
00:47:31.967 --> 00:47:33.000
- so you hit the first jump--
- Yep.

1160
00:47:33.133 --> 00:47:35.133
...Go up the A-frame
and then hit the second jump.

1161
00:47:35.266 --> 00:47:36.200
Get him on your side.

1162
00:47:36.333 --> 00:47:38.233
Okay. Come on. Sit.

1163
00:47:38.367 --> 00:47:40.133
Okay. ready? And... go!

1164
00:47:40.266 --> 00:47:42.000
Good job! And up!
We're gonna go--

1165
00:47:42.133 --> 00:47:43.667
walk. walk. walk. walk.
walk. walk. walk!

1166
00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:45.367
Good boy!

1167
00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:46.400
And jump!

1168
00:47:46.533 --> 00:47:48.233
Jump!

1169
00:47:49.433 --> 00:47:50.633
Good job! We did it!

1170
00:47:50.767 --> 00:47:52.467
I mean. Sam did it!

1171
00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.233
Good job.

1172
00:47:54.367 --> 00:47:55.700
- Good boy. Sam! Good boy!
- Good job.

1173
00:47:55.834 --> 00:47:57.133
Come here.

1174
00:47:57.266 --> 00:47:58.133
You're such a good boy!

1175
00:47:58.266 --> 00:47:59.133
Hey. Kev.

1176
00:47:59.266 --> 00:48:00.633
Hey!

1177
00:48:00.767 --> 00:48:02.266
What is all this?

1178
00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:03.767
Uh...

1179
00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:06.433
Kyra. this is Heather.
my sister. Heather--

1180
00:48:06.567 --> 00:48:07.567
this is Kyra and her dog. Sam.

1181
00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:09.033
Hi!

1182
00:48:09.166 --> 00:48:10.734
It is so nice to meet you.

1183
00:48:10.867 --> 00:48:12.700
So nice to meet you.
And you. you little cutie.

1184
00:48:12.834 --> 00:48:14.633
So. are you doing some training

1185
00:48:14.767 --> 00:48:16.900
or just having fun
with all of this?

1186
00:48:17.033 --> 00:48:18.467
- Uh. well. we--
- Yeah! We are.

1187
00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:20.266
Doing some serious training...

1188
00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:21.233
Very serious.

1189
00:48:22.533 --> 00:48:24.033
Actually. Kevin is amazing.

1190
00:48:24.166 --> 00:48:26.533
he's kind of like
the dog whisperer of trainers.

1191
00:48:26.667 --> 00:48:28.767
Well. I am not surprised.

1192
00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:30.400
You know. um...

1193
00:48:31.867 --> 00:48:34.200
I brought a half a roast chicken
from home.

1194
00:48:34.333 --> 00:48:36.266
if you want to join us
for a little dinner.

1195
00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:38.133
Oh...

1196
00:48:38.266 --> 00:48:40.734
That would be lovely.
Thank you.

1197
00:48:40.867 --> 00:48:43.300
I'll just heat this up.

1198
00:48:43.433 --> 00:48:45.133
That's so nice.

1199
00:48:45.266 --> 00:48:47.133
Um...

1200
00:48:47.266 --> 00:48:49.066
what do you say?

1201
00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:51.200
One more time around?

1202
00:48:51.333 --> 00:48:52.300
One more time.

1203
00:48:52.433 --> 00:48:53.934
Okay. Sam! Sam!

1204
00:48:54.066 --> 00:48:55.600
Hi! All right. ready?

1205
00:48:55.734 --> 00:48:56.800
We're gonna go.
We're gonna go.

1206
00:48:56.934 --> 00:48:58.066
Come on!

1207
00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.133
Good! Good!

1208
00:49:00.667 --> 00:49:02.200
And that is when it got crazy.

1209
00:49:02.333 --> 00:49:03.533
I mean. he brought home

1210
00:49:03.667 --> 00:49:05.367
every living creature
you can think of--

1211
00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:07.467
birds with broken wings.

1212
00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:09.133
toads from off the road...

1213
00:49:09.266 --> 00:49:10.633
it's when
you brought home the skunk.

1214
00:49:10.767 --> 00:49:11.533
that's when Mom drew the line.

1215
00:49:13.567 --> 00:49:14.667
That's when we got Buddy.

1216
00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:18.200
Ohh. Buddy? Was that your dog?

1217
00:49:18.333 --> 00:49:20.300
Yeah.

1218
00:49:20.433 --> 00:49:21.934
Yeah. more like
his best friend.

1219
00:49:22.066 --> 00:49:23.200
Do you have any pictures?

1220
00:49:23.333 --> 00:49:24.934
I would to see.

1221
00:49:25.066 --> 00:49:26.800
Are you kidding?
I have a whole album.

1222
00:49:26.934 --> 00:49:28.533
I'll go dig it up.

1223
00:49:28.667 --> 00:49:29.667
Oh. yeah.

1224
00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:31.100
Aww.

1225
00:49:32.433 --> 00:49:34.367
You know. I think it's...

1226
00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:35.500
I think it's really great

1227
00:49:35.633 --> 00:49:38.200
that you convinced Kevin
to help you train your dog.

1228
00:49:38.333 --> 00:49:40.633
No. I mean. like I said.
he is amazing!

1229
00:49:40.767 --> 00:49:43.133
I feel like the lucky one.

1230
00:49:43.266 --> 00:49:44.867
I think
that he's pretty lucky. too.

1231
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.633
Kevin's never really had
a lot of friends

1232
00:49:46.767 --> 00:49:48.433
or people that he's let
into his life.

1233
00:49:48.567 --> 00:49:51.500
which is why I'm so happy
that you're here.

1234
00:49:52.633 --> 00:49:55.967
You know. I've never seen him
like this with anyone.

1235
00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:58.834
And if he does let you
into his life.

1236
00:49:58.967 --> 00:50:00.266
he's gonna be

1237
00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:03.967
the most loyal friend
that you've ever had.

1238
00:50:08.633 --> 00:50:09.934
Here it is!

1239
00:50:10.066 --> 00:50:11.800
Oh. hey. you know what?

1240
00:50:11.934 --> 00:50:13.633
I've got an idea.
Why don't you two

1241
00:50:13.767 --> 00:50:15.667
take that out to the porch.
and I'll make some coffee?

1242
00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:16.800
Oh. no. no.
Here. let me help you.

1243
00:50:16.934 --> 00:50:17.867
Oh. no. no. no. no.

1244
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:18.934
I insist.

1245
00:50:19.066 --> 00:50:19.867
I got this.

1246
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.166
Don't. Don't fight her on it.

1247
00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:22.700
He's right.

1248
00:50:22.834 --> 00:50:23.834
Okay. okay.

1249
00:50:23.967 --> 00:50:25.500
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1250
00:50:25.633 --> 00:50:27.500
Go. before I change my mind.

1251
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.033
Yeah. there's
a seat right here.

1252
00:50:32.433 --> 00:50:34.200
...The two of you
were so cute.

1253
00:50:34.333 --> 00:50:35.300
Look!

1254
00:50:35.433 --> 00:50:37.867
You guys are swimming together.

1255
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.633
That was like
his favorite thing to do.

1256
00:50:39.767 --> 00:50:41.367
I couldn't keep him
out of the water.

1257
00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:42.934
Even a puddle--

1258
00:50:43.066 --> 00:50:44.934
he would just plunk himself
right in the middle of it.

1259
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.166
You know. I was thinking about
that to-do list of yours--

1260
00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:53.166
um. number four--

1261
00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:55.166
"sell and market"
your own product.

1262
00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:57.633
Right. Yes.

1263
00:50:57.767 --> 00:50:59.767
I am still working on that.

1264
00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:01.633
What about those bars
we just made?

1265
00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:04.266
The problem is there are
just so many gluten-free bars

1266
00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:05.700
on the market already.

1267
00:51:05.834 --> 00:51:08.934
Well. I was kind of thinking
for dogs. You know?

1268
00:51:09.066 --> 00:51:10.867
I think that might be
a little more original.

1269
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.834
That would be original.

1270
00:51:12.967 --> 00:51:14.433
but I mean. is there even
a market for that?

1271
00:51:14.567 --> 00:51:17.200
How many dogs
are gluten-free?

1272
00:51:17.333 --> 00:51:18.900
I know we have

1273
00:51:19.033 --> 00:51:21.400
plenty of dogs at the shelter
with food sensitivities.

1274
00:51:21.533 --> 00:51:23.066
and I mean. I could even
help you with marketing.

1275
00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:24.100
I could give away

1276
00:51:24.233 --> 00:51:25.934
a free bag of dog treats
with every adoption.

1277
00:51:26.066 --> 00:51:27.367
You would do that?

1278
00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:29.367
Yeah. of course.

1279
00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:32.233
If I were to sell these treats.

1280
00:51:32.367 --> 00:51:34.367
I would be happy

1281
00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:37.033
to donate a portion of the sales
to your shelter.

1282
00:51:37.166 --> 00:51:38.333
You don't have to do that.

1283
00:51:38.467 --> 00:51:41.967
I know I don't have to.
but I want to.

1284
00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:49.767
This is adorable.
by the way.

1285
00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:50.934
I don't even know
what I was doing there.

1286
00:51:51.066 --> 00:51:52.100
Look how cute you are!

1287
00:51:52.233 --> 00:51:53.200
Let's get back to--

1288
00:51:53.333 --> 00:51:54.600
You have
very pronounced dimples.

1289
00:51:54.734 --> 00:51:56.500
by the way.

1290
00:51:56.633 --> 00:51:58.500
It was so nice of her
to invite me.

1291
00:51:58.633 --> 00:52:00.767
Oh! Okay. Sam. Let's go.

1292
00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:03.400
- Ready to go.
- Ready to go! Come on.

1293
00:52:03.533 --> 00:52:05.266
Good!

1294
00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:06.800
Good boy.

1295
00:52:08.967 --> 00:52:10.133
You know.
I think I saw them

1296
00:52:10.266 --> 00:52:12.233
setting up the agility course
the other day.

1297
00:52:12.367 --> 00:52:13.567
Already?

1298
00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:14.734
Wow.

1299
00:52:14.867 --> 00:52:16.900
- Are you nervous?
- A bit!

1300
00:52:17.033 --> 00:52:21.300
It's just gonna be me and Sam
and a bunch of people watching.

1301
00:52:22.333 --> 00:52:25.266
Unless. of course.
you wanted to do it with me.

1302
00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:27.767
Oh. not a chance.

1303
00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:29.767
But don't worry.
we'll keep training.

1304
00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:32.834
and. you know.
hopefully calm those nerves.

1305
00:52:33.967 --> 00:52:35.367
Great.

1306
00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:44.467
Uh. hey. Kevin?

1307
00:52:45.633 --> 00:52:47.567
I just wanted to say thank you.

1308
00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:50.333
And not--
not just for the training.

1309
00:52:50.467 --> 00:52:52.066
but...

1310
00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:54.467
for letting me adopt Sam.

1311
00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:57.767
and for everything.

1312
00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:01.200
I'm just...
glad it's working out.

1313
00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:04.033
Me too.

1314
00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:07.834
Goodnight. Kyra.

1315
00:53:07.967 --> 00:53:09.900
Goodnight.

1316
00:53:27.834 --> 00:53:28.900
Sam!

1317
00:53:30.433 --> 00:53:31.300
Ready for your training?

1318
00:53:31.433 --> 00:53:32.900
Sam?

1319
00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:37.133
Oh.

1320
00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:41.367
Sam? What's wrong?

1321
00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:43.600
Are you sick. buddy?

1322
00:53:49.834 --> 00:53:51.100
Hello?

1323
00:53:51.233 --> 00:53:53.967
Hi. Kevin. there's
something wrong with Sam.

1324
00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:55.967
What? What is it?

1325
00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:57.934
I-I-I don't know.
he's just not moving.

1326
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.800
All right. can you bring him
down to the shelter?

1327
00:54:00.934 --> 00:54:01.867
Of course.

1328
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.433
I'll let the vet know
you're on your way.

1329
00:54:03.567 --> 00:54:05.000
Thank you!

1330
00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:09.200
Oh. no.

1331
00:54:09.333 --> 00:54:11.233
It's gonna be okay. Sam.

1332
00:54:15.567 --> 00:54:16.600
I appreciate
you running all the tests.

1333
00:54:16.734 --> 00:54:18.500
I'll have more
information when we're finished.

1334
00:54:18.633 --> 00:54:20.400
All right.
Thank you. Dr. Cormier.

1335
00:54:22.467 --> 00:54:24.133
Is everything okay?

1336
00:54:24.266 --> 00:54:25.200
How's Sam?

1337
00:54:25.333 --> 00:54:27.500
They are currently performing
an ultrasound

1338
00:54:27.633 --> 00:54:29.133
to see if there may be
an obstruction.

1339
00:54:29.266 --> 00:54:31.467
An obstruction of what?

1340
00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:33.500
I don't know. is there anything
he could've gotten into?

1341
00:54:33.633 --> 00:54:35.667
No. not that I can think of.

1342
00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:36.934
All right. well. here.

1343
00:54:37.066 --> 00:54:39.100
There's nothing we can do
but wait. so.

1344
00:54:44.433 --> 00:54:46.133
So could this be serious?

1345
00:54:46.266 --> 00:54:48.600
Depends what it is.

1346
00:54:48.734 --> 00:54:50.600
This is the worst.

1347
00:54:52.567 --> 00:54:55.567
I just can't imagine my life...

1348
00:54:56.734 --> 00:54:58.300
...if Sam wasn't around.

1349
00:54:58.433 --> 00:55:01.100
He's become like family.

1350
00:55:02.667 --> 00:55:04.700
I just can't lose anybody else.

1351
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.433
How old were you
when your dad left?

1352
00:55:16.567 --> 00:55:18.700
16.

1353
00:55:18.834 --> 00:55:21.900
And I know that...

1354
00:55:22.033 --> 00:55:23.700
sounds like
it's old enough to handle it.

1355
00:55:23.834 --> 00:55:26.100
but it still hurt.

1356
00:55:26.233 --> 00:55:28.900
And the worst part was.

1357
00:55:29.033 --> 00:55:31.800
there was nothing I could do
to stop it.

1358
00:55:34.233 --> 00:55:36.100
Is that why
you have the list?

1359
00:55:36.233 --> 00:55:38.900
So you can feel
more in control of things?

1360
00:55:39.033 --> 00:55:40.600
Yeah.

1361
00:55:40.734 --> 00:55:43.200
I mean. I know
that probably sounds crazy.

1362
00:55:43.333 --> 00:55:45.567
No. No.

1363
00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:49.200
I've been trying for years
not to get hurt. so.

1364
00:55:51.166 --> 00:55:52.433
Well. it must be impossible.

1365
00:55:52.567 --> 00:55:54.900
because look at
this situation right now.

1366
00:55:56.867 --> 00:55:58.767
If something happens
to Sam. I'm...

1367
00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:01.734
Hey. hey...

1368
00:56:01.867 --> 00:56:04.433
Look at me.

1369
00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:08.633
Sam is going to be okay.

1370
00:56:08.767 --> 00:56:10.300
Because he didn't wait this long

1371
00:56:10.433 --> 00:56:12.967
to get adopted by
the absolute perfect dog owner

1372
00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:14.667
just to end it like this. okay?

1373
00:56:16.133 --> 00:56:17.333
Okay.

1374
00:56:25.433 --> 00:56:27.333
- Is Sam okay?
- He's fine.

1375
00:56:27.467 --> 00:56:28.734
He had part of what
looked like a chopstick

1376
00:56:28.867 --> 00:56:29.767
lodged in his throat.

1377
00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:31.133
that we successfully extracted.

1378
00:56:32.367 --> 00:56:33.734
Oh. my goodness.
Thank you!

1379
00:56:33.867 --> 00:56:35.233
Thank you. thank you.
thank you. thank you!

1380
00:56:35.367 --> 00:56:36.567
We'll bring him out shortly.

1381
00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:39.000
Oh! He's gonna be okay!

1382
00:56:39.133 --> 00:56:40.600
- He is.
- Oh!

1383
00:56:43.266 --> 00:56:45.667
Thank you so much
for being here.

1384
00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:49.133
Yeah. Of course.

1385
00:56:53.233 --> 00:56:55.166
Sam!

1386
00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:57.467
Sam!

1387
00:56:57.600 --> 00:56:59.734
You're okay!

1388
00:56:59.867 --> 00:57:01.567
You scared me.

1389
00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:03.433
Well. Sam thinks you still are.

1390
00:57:10.467 --> 00:57:12.467
Good. good. good!
Go. go. go. go!

1391
00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:14.066
Looks like
Sam's back to normal.

1392
00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:15.967
Oh. you bet.
Watch this!

1393
00:57:16.100 --> 00:57:17.834
Okay. Sam. ready?
Come over here.

1394
00:57:17.967 --> 00:57:19.700
And weave! Go. go. go!

1395
00:57:19.834 --> 00:57:21.367
Good job. good job. good job!
- There you go. that's it!

1396
00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:22.700
All right. that's great.

1397
00:57:22.834 --> 00:57:23.700
Now. into the tunnel--

1398
00:57:23.834 --> 00:57:25.066
- Tunnel!
- In!

1399
00:57:26.467 --> 00:57:28.066
And tunnel!

1400
00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:29.633
Come on.

1401
00:57:29.767 --> 00:57:31.066
In the tunnel!

1402
00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:31.967
- Oh!
- Oh. oh!

1403
00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:33.800
Not on top.

1404
00:57:33.934 --> 00:57:35.800
- Well--
- I don't know.

1405
00:57:35.934 --> 00:57:37.033
He keeps doing this.

1406
00:57:37.166 --> 00:57:38.533
Maybe he's claustrophobic.

1407
00:57:38.667 --> 00:57:40.333
Maybe he just needs
a little encouragement.

1408
00:57:42.133 --> 00:57:45.033
Ahem. Watch this.

1409
00:57:46.767 --> 00:57:47.900
Ohh!

1410
00:57:51.166 --> 00:57:52.734
Hey!

1411
00:57:52.867 --> 00:57:53.700
Oh! Hi!

1412
00:57:53.834 --> 00:57:55.900
Wow. this looks like
a circus for dogs.

1413
00:57:56.033 --> 00:57:57.467
- Yep.
- Can Sam really do all this?

1414
00:57:57.600 --> 00:57:58.867
Oh. yeah!

1415
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.600
I mean. most of it.

1416
00:58:00.734 --> 00:58:01.600
Well. my hat's off to you.

1417
00:58:01.734 --> 00:58:03.200
because. honestly.
I didn't really think

1418
00:58:03.333 --> 00:58:05.200
you were gonna be able
to pull it off. but--

1419
00:58:05.333 --> 00:58:06.767
Did he follow me?

1420
00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:07.834
Oh. wow!

1421
00:58:07.967 --> 00:58:09.967
Sorry.
Didn't mean to startle you.

1422
00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:13.133
Um... uh. Kevin.

1423
00:58:13.266 --> 00:58:14.934
this is my colleague
and co-worker. Mark.

1424
00:58:15.066 --> 00:58:18.633
This is my friend
and trainer.

1425
00:58:18.767 --> 00:58:23.066
So you're the dog trainer
I've heard so much about?

1426
00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:26.567
Well. actually.
I'm not an official trainer.

1427
00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:28.300
Well. could've fooled me.

1428
00:58:28.433 --> 00:58:29.934
Kevin doesn't give himself
enough credit.

1429
00:58:30.066 --> 00:58:30.867
Like I always say.

1430
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.734
it's the dog owner
that gets trained.

1431
00:58:33.867 --> 00:58:35.800
so. Kyra deserves
a bit of credit as well.

1432
00:58:35.934 --> 00:58:37.033
Oh. Just a little bit?

1433
00:58:37.166 --> 00:58:39.567
Maybe more than a bit.

1434
00:58:42.333 --> 00:58:45.033
Well. seeing as you've both
been so hard at work here.

1435
00:58:45.166 --> 00:58:47.567
why don't you take some time

1436
00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:49.200
and I'll stay
and babysit Sam for a while?

1437
00:58:49.333 --> 00:58:51.133
- Oh--
- Let him get to know

1438
00:58:51.266 --> 00:58:52.767
his Uncle Mark.
I don't know if Kevin

1439
00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:55.600
can take any more time
away from the shelter.

1440
00:58:55.734 --> 00:58:57.100
Well. that would be great. actually.

1441
00:58:57.233 --> 00:58:59.066
I mean. I figured
we'd need a full day.

1442
00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:00.700
so I lined up some staff
to take over.

1443
00:59:00.834 --> 00:59:04.000
Really? Um...

1444
00:59:04.133 --> 00:59:05.700
well. in that case.
all right.

1445
00:59:05.834 --> 00:59:07.467
Okay. Come here. Sam!

1446
00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:09.667
Come here!
Are you gonna stay here?

1447
00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:11.467
Are you gonna be a good boy?

1448
00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:12.533
Okay. These are for you.

1449
00:59:12.667 --> 00:59:14.266
Okay. Thanks.

1450
00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:16.600
Thanks.

1451
00:59:16.734 --> 00:59:18.667
Hey.

1452
00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:20.000
Mom and Dad are gone.

1453
00:59:20.133 --> 00:59:21.567
Now where are those treats?

1454
00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:27.867
Thank you.

1455
00:59:29.967 --> 00:59:31.367
Oh. ho. ho. ho.

1456
00:59:32.433 --> 00:59:33.700
Ohh!

1457
00:59:33.834 --> 00:59:36.367
Now this
is a lot of ice cream.

1458
00:59:37.667 --> 00:59:40.433
You know. my mom and I used
to order these for dinner

1459
00:59:40.567 --> 00:59:42.100
before we'd go to the movies.

1460
00:59:42.233 --> 00:59:44.166
It would help take our mind
off things.

1461
00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:47.700
Mm. What about your dad?

1462
00:59:47.834 --> 00:59:51.133
His job transferred him
to the East Coast.

1463
00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:54.533
Mm.

1464
00:59:54.667 --> 00:59:56.200
Ah.

1465
00:59:56.333 --> 01:00:00.767
But we still talk. Sometimes.

1466
01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:04.166
But it's just been different
ever since he left.

1467
01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:05.266
Hmm.

1468
01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:07.000
What about you?

1469
01:00:07.133 --> 01:00:08.266
Are your parents still close?

1470
01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:09.200
Yeah.

1471
01:00:09.333 --> 01:00:11.600
My parents are. uh.

1472
01:00:11.734 --> 01:00:13.500
living their retirement dream
in the country

1473
01:00:13.633 --> 01:00:16.367
with three dogs.
all from the shelter.

1474
01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:18.600
which is just really ironic.

1475
01:00:18.734 --> 01:00:19.667
because before we had Buddy.

1476
01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:21.533
they never even thought
about having a dog.

1477
01:00:21.667 --> 01:00:23.600
I mean.
that's kind of like me.

1478
01:00:23.734 --> 01:00:25.767
I didn't think about it.
and now look at me--

1479
01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:28.133
I'm like
a helicopter dog-mom.

1480
01:00:30.967 --> 01:00:32.266
Actually
kind of makes me wonder

1481
01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.533
what I'll be like
when I have kids of my own.

1482
01:00:34.667 --> 01:00:36.934
If they're anything like me.
they'll be wild--

1483
01:00:37.066 --> 01:00:38.300
you know.
running around the park.

1484
01:00:38.433 --> 01:00:39.667
climbing up trees.

1485
01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:41.633
hanging upside-down
off monkey bars.

1486
01:00:41.767 --> 01:00:44.066
I'd be swinging
as high as I possibly could.

1487
01:00:46.333 --> 01:00:48.533
Actually sounds like
a lot of fun.

1488
01:00:55.133 --> 01:00:56.033
'Kay.

1489
01:00:56.166 --> 01:00:57.633
Put that down.

1490
01:00:57.767 --> 01:00:59.333
What? I just started.

1491
01:00:59.467 --> 01:01:01.533
No. You are getting
on a swing.

1492
01:01:01.667 --> 01:01:02.567
Right now?

1493
01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:04.367
Come on!

1494
01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:06.834
Hurry. before we lose them!

1495
01:01:11.667 --> 01:01:13.000
Let's see
who can swing the highest.

1496
01:01:13.133 --> 01:01:15.300
Okay.

1497
01:01:18.567 --> 01:01:19.934
All right.

1498
01:01:21.133 --> 01:01:22.500
Are you ready?

1499
01:01:22.633 --> 01:01:23.700
For what?

1500
01:01:23.834 --> 01:01:24.934
We're gonna jump!

1501
01:01:25.066 --> 01:01:26.166
- What. from here?
- Yes!

1502
01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:27.266
I think we're too high.
- Oh. come on.

1503
01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:29.367
On the count of three.

1504
01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:34.033
One...

1505
01:01:34.166 --> 01:01:36.266
- Two...
- I--

1506
01:01:37.533 --> 01:01:39.667
No. no. no. no. no.
no. no. no.

1507
01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:40.700
I'm gonna do it!

1508
01:01:40.834 --> 01:01:42.400
- No. don't!
- Three!

1509
01:01:44.333 --> 01:01:45.500
You good?

1510
01:01:45.633 --> 01:01:47.667
You good?

1511
01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:50.066
I'm good.

1512
01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.667
I'm good. too.

1513
01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:54.667
And that was easily
the most fun I've ever had

1514
01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:55.934
on a swing set.

1515
01:01:57.667 --> 01:01:59.200
Well. hey. the day's not over.

1516
01:01:59.333 --> 01:02:02.266
Do you wanna go see a movie?

1517
01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:05.066
Wow.

1518
01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:06.166
I don't think
I've been to see a movie

1519
01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:08.600
since my sister and I
went to see a screening

1520
01:02:08.734 --> 01:02:09.333
of The Incredible Journey.

1521
01:02:09.834 --> 01:02:12.100
You know. we could
watch a movie at my place.

1522
01:02:12.233 --> 01:02:13.834
That's a great idea.

1523
01:02:13.967 --> 01:02:16.166
I will just call Mark
and make sure Sam's okay.

1524
01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:18.433
Okay.

1525
01:02:19.867 --> 01:02:21.600
Oh! It's Mama.

1526
01:02:23.367 --> 01:02:24.433
Hey. everything okay?

1527
01:02:24.567 --> 01:02:25.467
It's great.

1528
01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:27.500
What about you?

1529
01:02:27.633 --> 01:02:28.767
We're having
a lot of fun. actually.

1530
01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:29.800
Really?

1531
01:02:29.934 --> 01:02:31.567
I wouldn't have guessed.

1532
01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:33.934
In fact. we are thinking
of watching a movie.

1533
01:02:34.066 --> 01:02:35.066
but only if

1534
01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:37.567
you can stay
and feed Sam dinner

1535
01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:39.000
and maybe take him
for a quick walk?

1536
01:02:39.133 --> 01:02:40.900
Yeah. of course.

1537
01:02:41.033 --> 01:02:43.500
So. is this movie
like a date-date?

1538
01:02:43.633 --> 01:02:45.100
- No! No. no. no. no.
- It's a date.

1539
01:02:45.233 --> 01:02:46.800
Right.

1540
01:02:46.934 --> 01:02:48.000
So. you just keep having fun

1541
01:02:48.133 --> 01:02:50.900
and I will feed Sam
and order takeout for myself.

1542
01:02:51.033 --> 01:02:53.967
Great.
Just no chopsticks. okay?

1543
01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:56.433
No chopsticks. Check.

1544
01:02:56.567 --> 01:02:57.500
Bye-ee!

1545
01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:05.967
Okay. Here it is.

1546
01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:08.633
The Incredible Journey.

1547
01:03:08.767 --> 01:03:12.133
Well. our popcorn is popped
and ready to go.

1548
01:03:12.266 --> 01:03:13.700
Don't mind if I do.

1549
01:03:13.834 --> 01:03:14.900
Now.

1550
01:03:15.033 --> 01:03:16.734
I have to warn you.

1551
01:03:16.867 --> 01:03:20.033
I have seen this movie
about a thousand times.

1552
01:03:20.166 --> 01:03:22.033
and so I may know
some of the lines by heart.

1553
01:03:22.166 --> 01:03:23.700
No! No. no. no. no. no.

1554
01:03:23.834 --> 01:03:25.567
There's no talking
during the movie.

1555
01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:26.967
That is a hard rule.

1556
01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:28.934
Okay. but before
we get started.

1557
01:03:29.066 --> 01:03:30.100
- my favorite part--
- No. Kevin!

1558
01:03:30.233 --> 01:03:33.200
You can't share spoilers.

1559
01:03:33.333 --> 01:03:35.567
Well. I'll just...

1560
01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:37.900
sit here and promise to...

1561
01:03:38.033 --> 01:03:39.867
not say anything.

1562
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.233
Perfect.

1563
01:03:41.367 --> 01:03:42.533
Oh. wait.

1564
01:03:42.667 --> 01:03:44.533
Um...

1565
01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:48.667
That's better.

1566
01:03:51.033 --> 01:03:51.967
Ready?

1567
01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:54.300
Ready.

1568
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.533
So what'd you think?

1569
01:04:23.867 --> 01:04:27.300
I think that was one of
the best movies I've ever seen.

1570
01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:32.533
The will to get home
to their family is just...

1571
01:04:32.667 --> 01:04:34.533
it's so beautiful.

1572
01:04:34.667 --> 01:04:37.100
Yeah.

1573
01:04:37.233 --> 01:04:41.834
It is an amazing bond
our pets have with us.

1574
01:04:45.767 --> 01:04:48.000
How do the dogs
at the shelter--

1575
01:04:48.133 --> 01:04:50.533
how do they get over
being abandoned?

1576
01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:54.133
It's the love of a new owner.

1577
01:04:54.266 --> 01:04:57.433
That's why it's so important

1578
01:04:57.567 --> 01:05:00.233
to find the right person
to adopt them.

1579
01:05:00.367 --> 01:05:02.600
Like you.

1580
01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:12.000
Uh... and on that note.

1581
01:05:12.133 --> 01:05:13.900
I should probably get home.

1582
01:05:14.033 --> 01:05:16.600
I don't want Sam
to worry about me.

1583
01:05:16.734 --> 01:05:17.600
And besides. I have

1584
01:05:17.734 --> 01:05:20.333
about a hundred dog treats
to bake tomorrow.

1585
01:05:20.467 --> 01:05:24.066
You know. I could help you out
with the treats.

1586
01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:25.934
Okay. Until tomorrow.

1587
01:05:27.967 --> 01:05:28.934
Goodnight.

1588
01:05:29.066 --> 01:05:30.967
Goodnight. Kyra.

1589
01:05:33.567 --> 01:05:35.133
Hello?

1590
01:05:36.567 --> 01:05:39.900
All right. Peter.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1591
01:05:40.033 --> 01:05:42.100
Bye.

1592
01:05:42.233 --> 01:05:43.567
Hi. Sam!

1593
01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:44.867
How was your date?

1594
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.533
Like I told you.
it was not a date.

1595
01:05:46.667 --> 01:05:48.900
Come on. seriously. Kyra.

1596
01:05:49.033 --> 01:05:50.667
Look. I know
this whole exercise

1597
01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:51.900
was to make Trevor

1598
01:05:52.033 --> 01:05:54.066
another check mark
on your to-do list.

1599
01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:56.767
but it clearly has become
more than that.

1600
01:05:56.900 --> 01:06:01.333
Yeah. but I just didn't know
how much I was gonna love Sam.

1601
01:06:01.467 --> 01:06:03.266
Just Sam?

1602
01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:06.066
Look...

1603
01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:08.000
if you're still hung up
on your list--

1604
01:06:08.133 --> 01:06:09.233
"loyal. dependable. faithful"--

1605
01:06:09.367 --> 01:06:10.433
that's great!

1606
01:06:10.567 --> 01:06:12.633
Because I actually think
it worked out.

1607
01:06:12.767 --> 01:06:14.166
I'm not sure I'm following.

1608
01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:15.266
Think about it.

1609
01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:16.500
Without the list.

1610
01:06:16.633 --> 01:06:18.266
you never would've
pursued Trevor.

1611
01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:21.000
which prompted you to get Sam.

1612
01:06:21.133 --> 01:06:23.300
which led you to Kevin. See?

1613
01:06:24.467 --> 01:06:27.567
I don't think that's exactly
how it was meant to work.

1614
01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:29.100
Are you sure?

1615
01:06:30.734 --> 01:06:33.734
Kyra. you can't ignore
what's happening.

1616
01:06:33.867 --> 01:06:34.700
And what's happening is.

1617
01:06:34.834 --> 01:06:36.800
you've fallen
for this dog whisperer.

1618
01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:40.500
So just take a chance
and go with it!

1619
01:06:41.467 --> 01:06:43.633
If you don't believe me.
believe this guy.

1620
01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:46.633
Who loves Uncle Mark?

1621
01:07:15.633 --> 01:07:16.633
Oh!

1622
01:07:16.767 --> 01:07:18.667
I got it!

1623
01:07:19.867 --> 01:07:21.867
Please.

1624
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.367
- Thank you.
- Here we go.

1625
01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:24.600
Ill take that.

1626
01:07:27.266 --> 01:07:28.300
I'm pretty sure

1627
01:07:28.433 --> 01:07:29.800
I cleaned the store
out of peanut butter and nuts.

1628
01:07:29.934 --> 01:07:31.400
Looks like it.

1629
01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:34.533
Sam! We're home!

1630
01:07:34.667 --> 01:07:36.200
I mean. I'm home.

1631
01:07:36.333 --> 01:07:37.734
We're both here.

1632
01:07:37.867 --> 01:07:39.200
Hi!

1633
01:07:39.333 --> 01:07:40.667
Here. give me that.

1634
01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:41.867
Oh. Thank you.

1635
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Hey!

1636
01:07:44.133 --> 01:07:46.133
Come on. Let's set you free.

1637
01:07:46.266 --> 01:07:47.066
Okay!

1638
01:07:48.467 --> 01:07:50.900
And I will take you
for a walk later.

1639
01:07:51.033 --> 01:07:52.633
when we are done here.

1640
01:07:52.767 --> 01:07:54.734
Oh. Check this out.

1641
01:07:54.867 --> 01:07:57.066
I found the cutest...

1642
01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:59.800
little...

1643
01:07:59.934 --> 01:08:01.066
cookie cutters!

1644
01:08:02.734 --> 01:08:04.567
Now it's gonna look like
we are making real dog treats.

1645
01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:05.767
Not to be confused
with people treats.

1646
01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:07.400
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

1647
01:08:07.533 --> 01:08:09.734
Although. you know.
I have to admit.

1648
01:08:09.867 --> 01:08:11.734
I may have sampled
some of Buddy's dog treats

1649
01:08:11.867 --> 01:08:12.734
when I was a kid.

1650
01:08:12.867 --> 01:08:14.033
For real?

1651
01:08:14.166 --> 01:08:15.300
Yeah. I was curious.

1652
01:08:15.433 --> 01:08:16.800
I mean. he seemed to like them
so much. so.

1653
01:08:16.934 --> 01:08:17.700
How did they taste?

1654
01:08:17.834 --> 01:08:19.767
Surprisingly salty.

1655
01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:23.367
Okay. well. in that case.
maybe we should try

1656
01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:24.600
the competitor brand.

1657
01:08:24.734 --> 01:08:26.800
see what I'm up against here.

1658
01:08:26.934 --> 01:08:28.100
You know what.

1659
01:08:28.233 --> 01:08:29.133
I think I've kinda had
my taste of dog treats.

1660
01:08:29.266 --> 01:08:31.166
plus. I really doubt
that they're wheat-free.

1661
01:08:32.667 --> 01:08:34.066
Here. Let's see. Um...

1662
01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:36.233
Corn. rice...

1663
01:08:36.367 --> 01:08:37.900
no wheat.

1664
01:08:38.867 --> 01:08:39.900
Still.

1665
01:08:40.033 --> 01:08:42.300
Oh. come on! Aren't you
just a little bit curious?

1666
01:08:42.433 --> 01:08:44.400
You're really serious
about this. aren't you?

1667
01:08:44.533 --> 01:08:45.567
Very.

1668
01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:46.633
Okay.

1669
01:08:46.767 --> 01:08:48.266
'Kay.

1670
01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:51.734
On the count of three.

1671
01:08:51.867 --> 01:08:53.233
One...

1672
01:08:53.367 --> 01:08:54.633
two... three.

1673
01:09:02.066 --> 01:09:04.133
I see what you were saying
about the salt.

1674
01:09:04.266 --> 01:09:06.633
Yeah. it really makes up
for the lack of flavor. but...

1675
01:09:06.767 --> 01:09:09.533
what is that taste
I'm getting?

1676
01:09:10.767 --> 01:09:11.867
Liver?

1677
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.233
Oh. my gosh!

1678
01:09:16.767 --> 01:09:18.433
Okay.

1679
01:09:18.567 --> 01:09:21.166
I think that is it.

1680
01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:24.033
We have more than enough
to distribute at the show.

1681
01:09:24.166 --> 01:09:25.834
for all of those adoptions
that I'm sure you're gonna make.

1682
01:09:25.967 --> 01:09:27.533
Let's hope.

1683
01:09:27.667 --> 01:09:30.500
So how are you
going to package all these?

1684
01:09:30.633 --> 01:09:32.633
Ooh. Um. I was thinking.

1685
01:09:32.767 --> 01:09:35.767
I would keep it simple

1686
01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:38.133
with some eco-friendly
brown paper bags.

1687
01:09:38.266 --> 01:09:39.834
But. actually. I'm still
having a bit of trouble

1688
01:09:39.967 --> 01:09:41.367
with the name.

1689
01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:43.467
I was thinking
of doing a riff on my name--

1690
01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.667
"K" for Kyra. "K9 Treats"?

1691
01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:48.333
It's not bad.

1692
01:09:48.467 --> 01:09:50.633
Yeah. but it's not
really original.

1693
01:09:50.767 --> 01:09:51.567
Well...

1694
01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:52.867
With all the help
that you're giving me.

1695
01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.200
I should probably
give you a nod.

1696
01:09:54.333 --> 01:09:56.266
Well. you-- no.

1697
01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:58.533
Wait a second.
That's it.

1698
01:09:58.667 --> 01:09:59.467
What?

1699
01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:02.000
"Kevin and Kyra."
"KK9."

1700
01:10:03.767 --> 01:10:05.300
That's kind of different. right?

1701
01:10:05.433 --> 01:10:07.166
Yeah. I mean. I like it. but--

1702
01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:08.667
- But?
- But you don't have to.

1703
01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:09.767
Oh. come on.
this whole thing was your idea.

1704
01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:12.533
It's more than right.

1705
01:10:14.166 --> 01:10:15.867
Does have a nice ring to it.

1706
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.300
What do you say?
"KK9"?

1707
01:10:20.066 --> 01:10:21.166
Pop!

1708
01:10:23.066 --> 01:10:26.533
Oh. yeah. you know.
I probably should bring Sam in

1709
01:10:26.667 --> 01:10:27.800
to eat his dinner.

1710
01:10:27.934 --> 01:10:29.533
before he starts giving me
the evil eye.

1711
01:10:29.667 --> 01:10:33.033
Yes. and if it's that time.
I should get going.

1712
01:10:33.166 --> 01:10:35.166
But I will see you two
at the show.

1713
01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:36.200
Right.

1714
01:10:36.333 --> 01:10:37.266
And hey.

1715
01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:38.800
Don't worry. okay?

1716
01:10:38.934 --> 01:10:40.166
Whatever happens
in that arena...

1717
01:10:41.834 --> 01:10:43.834
...I think
we did pretty good.

1718
01:10:43.967 --> 01:10:46.467
Yeah. I think we did.

1719
01:10:52.633 --> 01:10:54.033
Hey. Kevin?

1720
01:10:54.166 --> 01:10:56.166
Um...

1721
01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:57.700
I just wanted to say--

1722
01:10:57.834 --> 01:11:00.934
and I know
you might not think so--

1723
01:11:01.066 --> 01:11:04.033
but you really are
great with people.

1724
01:11:04.166 --> 01:11:05.166
not just with dogs.

1725
01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:08.266
And I wanted to tell you that.

1726
01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:10.700
in case you ever--
I don't know--

1727
01:11:10.834 --> 01:11:13.367
in case you ever wanted to turn
this whole training thing

1728
01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:15.533
into a real thing someday.

1729
01:11:15.667 --> 01:11:19.400
Because any new dog owner
would be lucky to have you.

1730
01:11:21.834 --> 01:11:23.100
Thanks for that.

1731
01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.266
Sam.

1732
01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:47.567
Look at that face.
Look at that face!

1733
01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:48.867
Do you want a treat?

1734
01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.433
This is all because of you.
after all.

1735
01:11:50.567 --> 01:11:51.467
Ready?

1736
01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:52.600
Okay.

1737
01:11:52.734 --> 01:11:55.066
Good boy! Good boy. Sam.

1738
01:12:02.567 --> 01:12:04.133
Well. Mark?
You were right.

1739
01:12:13.734 --> 01:12:14.633
Hey!

1740
01:12:14.767 --> 01:12:15.967
- Hey.
- Oh. good.

1741
01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:16.934
I caught you
before you left.

1742
01:12:17.066 --> 01:12:18.200
What's the...

1743
01:12:18.333 --> 01:12:19.266
Dog toys

1744
01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:21.033
and blankets-- here--

1745
01:12:21.166 --> 01:12:23.300
from the kids.
collected at the daycare.

1746
01:12:23.433 --> 01:12:25.133
Okay. These are great. Heather.

1747
01:12:25.266 --> 01:12:28.133
I can give 'em away
with Kyra's dog treats.

1748
01:12:28.266 --> 01:12:31.700
Oh! So. how is that going.
by the way?

1749
01:12:32.967 --> 01:12:34.033
It's good. it's good.

1750
01:12:34.166 --> 01:12:36.000
I think that. you know.
she and her dog

1751
01:12:36.133 --> 01:12:37.066
are as ready
as they'll ever be.

1752
01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:39.834
Hmm. I wasn't talking
about the training. Kev.

1753
01:12:39.967 --> 01:12:41.333
Come on!
You can't pretend

1754
01:12:41.467 --> 01:12:43.100
you don't feel something
for her.

1755
01:12:43.233 --> 01:12:44.433
So what if I do?

1756
01:12:44.567 --> 01:12:46.033
It doesn't mean
that she feels the same.

1757
01:12:46.166 --> 01:12:47.533
There's really only one way
to find out.

1758
01:12:48.767 --> 01:12:49.700
I can't do that.

1759
01:12:49.834 --> 01:12:51.033
It's no different

1760
01:12:51.166 --> 01:12:52.600
than what you do here every day
at the shelter.

1761
01:12:52.734 --> 01:12:55.000
You take a chance on people
for the sake of these dogs.

1762
01:12:55.133 --> 01:12:58.033
only now it's you
who needs to take a chance.

1763
01:12:58.166 --> 01:13:00.066
I mean. I guess
I did take a chance on her

1764
01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:02.000
when I let her adopt Sam. so...

1765
01:13:02.133 --> 01:13:03.100
Come here.

1766
01:13:03.233 --> 01:13:04.333
Bring it in.
Bring it in.

1767
01:13:04.467 --> 01:13:05.900
What is this for?

1768
01:13:06.033 --> 01:13:07.433
It's because I'm your sister--

1769
01:13:07.567 --> 01:13:09.567
and I love you.

1770
01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:13.266
And just know that...

1771
01:13:14.667 --> 01:13:16.100
...I'm here for you. so...

1772
01:13:16.233 --> 01:13:18.367
- I know.
- That's what sisters are for.

1773
01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:19.900
Take the plunge. all right?

1774
01:13:20.033 --> 01:13:21.533
Just take the plunge.

1775
01:13:21.667 --> 01:13:22.633
Take the plunge!

1776
01:13:25.467 --> 01:13:27.400
"Take the plunge."

1777
01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:30.600
I just can't believe it.

1778
01:13:30.734 --> 01:13:32.500
You were right. Mark--

1779
01:13:32.633 --> 01:13:35.500
about how following the list
led me to Kevin.

1780
01:13:35.633 --> 01:13:38.333
and how Kevin checks off
all the important things.

1781
01:13:38.467 --> 01:13:39.500
See? I am not just here
to tell you

1782
01:13:39.633 --> 01:13:40.533
when there's something
in your teeth.

1783
01:13:40.667 --> 01:13:43.033
So. what are you going to do?

1784
01:13:43.166 --> 01:13:45.567
Ask him out
on. like. a doggie play date?

1785
01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:47.834
Yes. I was thinking
maybe after the show--

1786
01:13:47.967 --> 01:13:51.166
you know.
a little celebration for two?

1787
01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:52.533
That's romantic.

1788
01:13:52.667 --> 01:13:54.233
I mean. think of the story
you can tell

1789
01:13:54.367 --> 01:13:56.433
about how you met
when you adopted a dog

1790
01:13:56.567 --> 01:13:58.600
with the intention
of impressing your perfect man.

1791
01:13:58.734 --> 01:14:00.734
I think I'll leave
that part out.

1792
01:14:00.867 --> 01:14:03.266
but you're right.
it's a great story.

1793
01:14:13.233 --> 01:14:15.367
Hey.

1794
01:14:18.633 --> 01:14:20.834
There she is.
the owner of the Superpup.

1795
01:14:21.934 --> 01:14:23.000
Here I am.

1796
01:14:23.133 --> 01:14:24.500
Wow.

1797
01:14:24.633 --> 01:14:27.166
That trainer of yours
must really be something

1798
01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:29.400
for you to have
actually pulled this off.

1799
01:14:29.533 --> 01:14:30.600
Lara. I--

1800
01:14:30.734 --> 01:14:32.000
Don't try to convince me

1801
01:14:32.133 --> 01:14:35.233
that your dog. Sam.
or Sparky. or whatever.

1802
01:14:35.367 --> 01:14:37.667
was a Superpup
before you adopted him.

1803
01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:38.767
and tried to snare Trevor.

1804
01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:40.967
Look. I wasn't trying to--

1805
01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:43.066
It's okay.
You're a keener.

1806
01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:45.266
And once again.
you've clearly pulled it off

1807
01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:47.333
with how much Trevor goes on

1808
01:14:47.467 --> 01:14:49.567
about how amazing
you and your dog are.

1809
01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:50.600
So...

1810
01:14:50.734 --> 01:14:52.300
well played. Kyra.

1811
01:14:58.367 --> 01:14:59.433
Kevin?

1812
01:14:59.567 --> 01:15:01.800
Kevin! Hi!

1813
01:15:01.934 --> 01:15:03.300
Kevin?

1814
01:15:03.433 --> 01:15:05.133
Hey! What are you doing?
Stop. Kevin?

1815
01:15:05.266 --> 01:15:06.800
Hey.

1816
01:15:06.934 --> 01:15:07.967
What's going on?

1817
01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:09.967
Why are you
running away from me?

1818
01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:12.000
Just thought I needed
to talk to you.

1819
01:15:12.133 --> 01:15:15.700
but luckily.
I got clarification first.

1820
01:15:15.834 --> 01:15:17.667
Now I don't.

1821
01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:19.367
What are you talking about?

1822
01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:21.400
The reason you adopted Sam?

1823
01:15:21.533 --> 01:15:23.333
Why you hired me
to train him--

1824
01:15:23.467 --> 01:15:26.166
it's not because
you really wanted a dog

1825
01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:28.800
or because you may have
over-exaggerated his abilities--

1826
01:15:28.934 --> 01:15:30.834
which is... it's fine.
It's just...

1827
01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:33.000
I don't know.

1828
01:15:33.133 --> 01:15:35.200
I'm just glad
everything worked out.

1829
01:15:35.333 --> 01:15:36.700
- especially for Sam.
- Wait. Kevin. I don't think

1830
01:15:36.834 --> 01:15:38.567
- you-you understand.
- Kyra?

1831
01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:42.166
I don't mean to interrupt.

1832
01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:44.567
Um. do you have a minute?
I need some help in the back.

1833
01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:47.133
Actually. Trevor. I am
just in the middle of something.

1834
01:15:47.266 --> 01:15:48.300
No. she's not.

1835
01:15:48.433 --> 01:15:51.467
Enjoy the show tomorrow. because...

1836
01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:54.033
Kyra and Sam are really...

1837
01:15:54.166 --> 01:15:56.233
quite something.

1838
01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:58.533
Kevin! Wait! I...

1839
01:15:58.667 --> 01:15:59.600
Kyra--

1840
01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:02.934
Yes. Trevor?

1841
01:16:03.066 --> 01:16:04.734
What can I do for you?

1842
01:16:04.867 --> 01:16:07.834
To be honest.
I just wanted to ask...

1843
01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:11.867
Wow. this is awkward
since we all work together.

1844
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.333
Oh...

1845
01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:18.266
Yeah. um. Trevor... look.

1846
01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:22.066
Um. I'm sorry. if you are
trying to ask me out right now--

1847
01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:23.266
Wow.

1848
01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:24.400
This is really awkward.

1849
01:16:25.533 --> 01:16:26.467
I was wondering

1850
01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:29.567
if you thought
that Lara would be interested

1851
01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:31.033
in going out with me?

1852
01:16:31.166 --> 01:16:32.900
- Lara?
- It's not often that you find

1853
01:16:33.033 --> 01:16:35.300
someone who checks off
all the boxes.

1854
01:16:35.433 --> 01:16:36.734
and she really does.

1855
01:16:37.834 --> 01:16:40.300
Yeah. I get that.

1856
01:16:42.266 --> 01:16:44.367
You know what?
I think that she would say yes.

1857
01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:45.734
That's great.

1858
01:16:45.867 --> 01:16:47.100
Thank you.

1859
01:16:47.233 --> 01:16:50.567
Um. you really made my day.

1860
01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:54.066
Well. I'm glad
I made somebody's.

1861
01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:57.734
Um. would it be okay
if I went home?

1862
01:16:57.867 --> 01:17:00.767
I just have a lot to do
before the show tomorrow.

1863
01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:02.600
Of course! Go.

1864
01:17:02.734 --> 01:17:04.433
And we'll see
the dynamic duo tomorrow.

1865
01:17:16.734 --> 01:17:18.200
Hey. Mom.

1866
01:17:18.333 --> 01:17:21.967
Are you still going on
river rides with Valentin?

1867
01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:23.533
No. but we're having
lunch tomorrow.

1868
01:17:23.667 --> 01:17:24.834
Mm.

1869
01:17:24.967 --> 01:17:26.066
How about you?

1870
01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:29.166
Oh... everything i...

1871
01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:30.867
great.

1872
01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.400
I can see that's not true.

1873
01:17:32.533 --> 01:17:34.133
Yeah.

1874
01:17:34.266 --> 01:17:36.233
Well. you know me.

1875
01:17:36.367 --> 01:17:38.033
Thought I had everything
under control.

1876
01:17:38.166 --> 01:17:40.400
and then I had to go ahead
and lose focus.

1877
01:17:40.533 --> 01:17:41.700
Now...

1878
01:17:41.834 --> 01:17:43.333
everything is a mess.

1879
01:17:43.467 --> 01:17:44.867
Does this have to do
with dog-lover?

1880
01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.934
Yeah.

1881
01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.033
Mom.

1882
01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:51.834
Why?

1883
01:17:51.967 --> 01:17:53.967
How could I let this happen?

1884
01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:55.200
Sweetheart!

1885
01:17:55.333 --> 01:17:57.200
You can't control it.
it just happens--

1886
01:17:57.333 --> 01:17:59.200
like me and your father.

1887
01:17:59.333 --> 01:18:00.300
We were in love once.

1888
01:18:00.433 --> 01:18:02.600
So you're saying
that I was meant to be here.

1889
01:18:02.734 --> 01:18:04.467
right now.
feeling horrible.

1890
01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:07.433
because I just lost everything
that I thought I had with him?

1891
01:18:07.567 --> 01:18:10.467
Before you let it go.
it's always worth a fight.

1892
01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:13.066
Did you fight for Dad?

1893
01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:14.633
I did.

1894
01:18:14.767 --> 01:18:16.233
For you.

1895
01:18:16.367 --> 01:18:18.633
For me.
because I still loved him.

1896
01:18:18.767 --> 01:18:22.467
so I had to at least try--
just like you do.

1897
01:18:23.867 --> 01:18:24.967
Okay.

1898
01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:26.400
I will.

1899
01:18:26.533 --> 01:18:28.133
That's my girl.

1900
01:18:28.266 --> 01:18:30.100
I love you. Mom.

1901
01:18:30.233 --> 01:18:31.734
I love you. sweetheart.

1902
01:18:31.867 --> 01:18:33.600

1910
01:19:14.834 --> 01:19:15.734
Can I take Sam for you?

1911
01:19:15.867 --> 01:19:17.533
Oh. yes. thank you so much.

1912
01:19:21.567 --> 01:19:23.567
So you know.
let your parents know.

1913
01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:25.100
there's a bit of a screening
process beforehand

1914
01:19:25.233 --> 01:19:26.233
to determine eligibility.

1915
01:19:26.367 --> 01:19:28.166
Why don't I give you this

1916
01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:29.900
and you can take that home
to your parents.

1917
01:19:30.033 --> 01:19:31.033
and let them know?

1918
01:19:31.166 --> 01:19:33.233
Cool.

1919
01:19:40.133 --> 01:19:41.033
Hey...

1920
01:19:41.166 --> 01:19:43.433
Hey.

1921
01:19:43.567 --> 01:19:46.166
So. are you finding
a lot of likely candidates?

1922
01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:49.000
Uh. a few. yeah.

1923
01:19:49.133 --> 01:19:51.166
I still need to. uh.
dig a little deeper

1924
01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:54.133
into their intentions
to have a dog. though.

1925
01:19:55.333 --> 01:19:57.433
Right. of course.

1926
01:19:58.633 --> 01:20:01.233
Well. here are the cookies. Ahem.

1927
01:20:01.367 --> 01:20:02.333
Thanks.

1928
01:20:02.467 --> 01:20:04.400
Um...

1929
01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:07.367
Good luck out there.

1930
01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:09.600
Yeah.

1931
01:20:09.734 --> 01:20:11.433
Good luck
with the adoptions.

1932
01:20:11.567 --> 01:20:15.066
I hope you find
a lot of forever homes.

1933
01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:17.700
Thanks.

1934
01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:22.266
Kevin. Listen.

1935
01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:24.433
I know I wasn't
entirely truthful

1936
01:20:24.567 --> 01:20:27.567
as to why I adopted Sam.

1937
01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:29.767
And I know that
you probably don't trust me.

1938
01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:32.100
which I get.
because I wouldn't trust me.

1939
01:20:32.233 --> 01:20:36.533
And I think I have
always been so scared

1940
01:20:36.667 --> 01:20:39.900
of falling for someone
who might someday leave me.

1941
01:20:40.033 --> 01:20:42.533
that I figured

1942
01:20:42.667 --> 01:20:44.600
finding someone faithful
and dependable

1943
01:20:44.734 --> 01:20:46.400
was the most important thing.

1944
01:20:47.467 --> 01:20:49.667
But I was wrong.

1945
01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:53.433
Finding someone that you enjoy
spending time with.

1946
01:20:53.567 --> 01:20:56.600
finding someone who feels like
your best friend--

1947
01:20:56.734 --> 01:20:58.400
that is also important.

1948
01:20:59.734 --> 01:21:02.266
And while I might feel terrified

1949
01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:03.567
about what might happen

1950
01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:06.767
five. ten.
fifteen years from now...

1951
01:21:06.900 --> 01:21:08.800
all I can say

1952
01:21:08.934 --> 01:21:11.133
is that right here.
right now.

1953
01:21:11.266 --> 01:21:13.800
in this moment...

1954
01:21:13.934 --> 01:21:15.533
I love you.

1955
01:21:16.867 --> 01:21:19.567
And. uh. I just...

1956
01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:22.033
couldn't ignore that.

1957
