Then I was like. "Nope."

340
00:17:23.542 --> 00:17:27.296
The teachers here. they're hard on you.
and they're tough. but they care.

341
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.758
I just feel like it's a family.

342
00:17:30.841 --> 00:17:33.302
Miss Allen cares
about every single one of us.

343
00:17:33.385 --> 00:17:35.596
which is. like. really good.

344
00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.852
[girl] I've been at DADA for nine years.

345
00:17:41.935 --> 00:17:44.313
since I was five. and I'm 14 now.

346
00:17:44.396 --> 00:17:48.400
So… I've basically grown up in DADA.

347
00:17:51.361 --> 00:17:53.572
When they first told me I was Kara.

348
00:17:53.655 --> 00:17:56.658
I was. like. nervous and happy

349
00:17:56.742 --> 00:18:00.162
because I felt like I had
such a big responsibility

350
00:18:00.245 --> 00:18:04.166
to. like. make sure I wouldn't mess up
or. like. screw up the entire show.

351
00:18:04.249 --> 00:18:06.001
Everybody wants to be Kara.

352
00:18:06.085 --> 00:18:08.212
which is the lead role.

353
00:18:08.295 --> 00:18:11.173
She's the little girl
who goes on an adventure.

354
00:18:11.757 --> 00:18:14.343
And Miss Allen
always double casts the show

355
00:18:14.426 --> 00:18:17.221
so that people
get to interchange their roles

356
00:18:17.304 --> 00:18:19.640
and have different experiences.

357
00:18:19.723 --> 00:18:20.849
[photographer] Nice.

358
00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:23.811
-♪ Kara. Kara. won't you smile? ♪
-To the camera.

359
00:18:23.894 --> 00:18:27.022
-♪ Take a look. tell me what you think ♪
-Tell me what you think!

360
00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:31.902
I remember Miss Allen. she told me
that I was gonna be Kara for three shows.

361
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.488
and I literally freaked out.

362
00:18:34.571 --> 00:18:36.573
♪ My dear. such a surprise ♪

363
00:18:36.657 --> 00:18:39.535

366
00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:46.458
[girl] You know we love you!

367
00:18:46.542 --> 00:18:49.419
It's that feeling when it's like
you have a goal. and you reach it.

368
00:18:49.503 --> 00:18:53.549
and you meet it. and it's like. "Yes!"
You know? So I was so happy.

369
00:18:53.632 --> 00:18:55.008
[indistinct chattering]

370
00:18:58.137 --> 00:19:01.348
[Debbie]
Now. let's talk about the Egyptian Doll.

371
00:19:02.099 --> 00:19:07.020
You wanna get right under her little butt.
and you have her hand. if she needs it.

372
00:19:07.104 --> 00:19:09.022
And you press her all the way up.

373
00:19:09.773 --> 00:19:12.860
That is the position.
and you're on the other side.

374
00:19:12.943 --> 00:19:16.655
I was the first Egyptian Doll.
My mother choreographed that on me.

375
00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:18.490
[solemn music playing]

376
00:19:20.242 --> 00:19:21.076
Boo!

377
00:19:21.535 --> 00:19:23.036
And one and two.

378
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.038
One. two. three.

379
00:19:25.122 --> 00:19:27.875
Single turn. open. Head. head.

380
00:19:28.458 --> 00:19:32.754
[Vivian] I really started training
heavily and seriously in dance

381
00:19:32.838 --> 00:19:34.173
at the Kirov Academy of Ballet.

382
00:19:34.256 --> 00:19:37.634
It's about right here
that you start. She splits.

383
00:19:38.135 --> 00:19:39.887
[Vivian] My third year there.

384
00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:43.182
my teacher looked at me one day in class.

385
00:19:43.265 --> 00:19:45.517
and goes. "Stop. stop. stop. stop. stop!"

386
00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:48.979
And. um.
he looked at me. and he goes.

387
00:19:49.062 --> 00:19:50.647
[in Russian accent]
"You never be dancer.

388
00:19:51.148 --> 00:19:52.524
You go Alvin Ailey."

389
00:19:52.608 --> 00:19:54.193
And that was a dig.

390
00:19:54.693 --> 00:19:57.112
[Debbie] Like Alvin Ailey was nothing?

391
00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:59.072
[chuckles] Alvin Ailey's our premier.

392
00:19:59.573 --> 00:20:02.201
you know.
contemporary American dance company.

393
00:20:02.826 --> 00:20:05.204
and. yes. it's mostly Black people. but…

394
00:20:06.371 --> 00:20:08.081
that means she can't dance?

395
00:20:08.582 --> 00:20:11.543
Child. I was coming through that phone.
I was getting ready--

396
00:20:11.627 --> 00:20:14.922
I sent my husband
because I knew I was not gonna be nice.

397
00:20:15.005 --> 00:20:18.842
For me. having my daughter gone
for a coup-- three or four-- three years.

398
00:20:18.926 --> 00:20:21.053
it was time for her to come back home
in my eyes anyway.

399
00:20:21.136 --> 00:20:22.763
He pulled me out of the school.

400
00:20:23.305 --> 00:20:26.058
and that's when my mother decided

401
00:20:26.141 --> 00:20:28.518
that she was gonna create
the Debbie Allen Dance Academy.

402
00:20:28.602 --> 00:20:32.439
And so I started DADA. and she came home.

403
00:20:32.522 --> 00:20:33.982
She was the inspiration.

404
00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:36.235
She's my muse. She always has been.

405
00:20:37.611 --> 00:20:39.863
[Karen]
There's something here for everyone.

406
00:20:39.947 --> 00:20:44.826
You know. every shape.
every size. every color. every culture.

407
00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.787
and that makes us very unique.

408
00:20:47.287 --> 00:20:51.041
And she's gonna walk over.
and then you all recede back.

409
00:20:51.124 --> 00:20:52.209
She is the one.

410
00:20:53.377 --> 00:20:55.420
-She's adorable.
-And she's fierce.

411
00:20:55.504 --> 00:20:57.297
-She's fierce.

[Debbie]
April is cutting where she has to cut.

413
00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:05.555
You all need to keep coming around.
You can do it.

414
00:21:06.974 --> 00:21:10.727
[April] I didn't start actually dancing
until I was eight years old.

415
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.397
I came here from North Carolina.

416
00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:17.609
and I-- I received full scholarship
by Debbie Allen.

417
00:21:17.693 --> 00:21:24.199
April is one of the most gifted dancers
I've ever come into my circle.

418
00:21:24.866 --> 00:21:27.411
And I brought her here
so we could nurture her

419
00:21:27.494 --> 00:21:28.620
because she needs it.

420
00:21:28.704 --> 00:21:31.707
[April]
I have a part-time job at El Pollo Loco.

421
00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:32.791
I'm a cashier.

422
00:21:33.458 --> 00:21:36.128
So. right now. I'm a cashier.

423
00:21:40.966 --> 00:21:43.844
People usually see me as a quiet person.

424
00:21:43.927 --> 00:21:45.637
and. like. most of the time.

425
00:21:45.721 --> 00:21:48.432
I have a lot to say.
or I have a lot on my mind.

426
00:21:48.515 --> 00:21:52.936
but I just don't know how to…
you know. I don't know how to say it.

427
00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:57.316
And sometimes. like.
I have so much emotions inside of myself.

428
00:21:58.358 --> 00:22:03.488
and the only way I can get my emotions
or my fear or my anxiety out

429
00:22:03.572 --> 00:22:05.157
is through dance.

430
00:22:10.078 --> 00:22:11.163
[Giana] Ready?

431

The whole rhythm.

00:22:41.568 --> 00:22:45.405
this whole thing has to feel like
one person moving.

for the longest.

448

I'm too young to be in "Bollywood."

that allows
for new choreography. new costumes.

It's good for you.

Okay. break. Getting better.

481
00:24:27.883 --> 00:24:28.925
Listen to me.

482
00:24:29.009 --> 00:24:32.721
You're going much wider than you need to.
You're killing yourselves.

483
00:24:32.804 --> 00:24:34.514
Okay. breathe.
then we're gonna do "Egypt."

484
00:24:34.598 --> 00:24:36.016
Just breathe. Breathe.

485
00:24:36.516 --> 00:24:37.601
You have two minutes.

486
00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:43.148
Okay. so. Miss Nicholas.

487
00:24:46.109 --> 00:24:48.278
Okay. we're really gonna be okay.

488
00:24:48.361 --> 00:24:50.906
but they're just raggedy.
Too raggedy for me right--

489
00:24:50.989 --> 00:24:54.159
I can't-- uh. '"Fairyland."
I'm-- I'm not feelin' it. No.

490
00:24:54.701 --> 00:24:58.747
So I'm adding. in yellow.
things that we're going to rehearse.

491
00:25:01.333 --> 00:25:04.127
Okay. now. I gotta go terrorize
the fairies. I'm sorry.

492
00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.463
[piano playing "Fairyland" music]

493
00:25:11.134 --> 00:25:12.677
Because I came from DADA.

494
00:25:12.761 --> 00:25:17.891
I didn't realize how big of a deal
that I was a Black girl who does ballet.

495
00:25:17.974 --> 00:25:18.892
[Debbie] Lovely!

496
00:25:20.602 --> 00:25:24.898
[Kylie] Like. the world
is so different from DADA. [chuckles]

497
00:25:24.981 --> 00:25:28.652
'Cause. where I come from. we all do it.
and we were all good.

who was the first Black ballerina
in a major ballet company.

500
00:25:38.411 --> 00:25:40.121
came here a year ago.

501
00:25:40.205 --> 00:25:43.792
And a one. and two.
pas de cheval. enveloppé.

502
00:25:43.875 --> 00:25:47.379
I never thought. "I wanna be
a ballet dancer." not at the age of seven.

503
00:25:48.797 --> 00:25:51.132
I just thought it was fun
taking the classes.

504
00:25:52.592 --> 00:25:56.638
So I just really didn't realize
the impact of being African American

505
00:25:56.721 --> 00:25:57.931
and a principal dancer.

506
00:26:01.142 --> 00:26:06.064
And I found out there weren't very many.
There weren't any at that time. really.

507
00:26:06.147 --> 00:26:09.359
Unless you were in Alvin Ailey
or Dance Theatre of Harlem.

508
00:26:10.819 --> 00:26:13.572
But I just wanted to dance.
That wasn't my big focus.

509
00:26:13.655 --> 00:26:15.365
that I wanted to be
the first Black anything.

510
00:26:15.448 --> 00:26:16.783
I just wanted to dance.

511
00:26:16.866 --> 00:26:18.827
Plié. one. and stretch.

512
00:26:22.956 --> 00:26:24.624
[lively ballet music playing]

513
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:28.295
[Lauren]
When I first saw April.

514
00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:32.173
I thought. "Wow!
Where did that come from?"

515
00:26:32.257 --> 00:26:34.884
That's somebody
that's born with everything.

516
00:26:39.848 --> 00:26:40.974
[Debbie] Yes!

517
00:26:42.017 --> 00:26:42.851
Love it.

518
00:26:46.146 --> 00:26:49.149
What I need is something that sustains.
I feel like it's…

519
00:26:49.899 --> 00:26:51.192
I want it to be lighter.

520
00:26:51.276 --> 00:26:52.736
[scats softly]

521
00:26:52.819 --> 00:26:56.656
[April] I don't think I ha--
necessarily have a ballet body right now.

522
00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.908
as of this moment… [chuckles]

523
00:26:58.992 --> 00:27:02.746
…because my legs
are just a little bit overdeveloped.

524
00:27:02.829 --> 00:27:04.623
[Debbie scats rhythmically]

525
00:27:05.165 --> 00:27:09.127
And when you get really serious. you start
looking at yourself in a certain way.

526
00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:12.422
Chaîné. chaîné. chaîné.
chaîné. chaîné. chaîné. chaîné.

527
00:27:12.505 --> 00:27:13.923
Stop on a dime.

528
00:27:14.883 --> 00:27:15.759
And stay.

529
00:27:16.343 --> 00:27:21.264
But when I'm in the ballet world.
mostly everyone is pretty thin.

530
00:27:21.348 --> 00:27:24.559
In high school.
I really had no problem with it.

531
00:27:24.643 --> 00:27:27.479
and then you realize
that maybe you should look at it.

532
00:27:27.562 --> 00:27:30.732
because everybody else looks
at weight and…

533
00:27:30.815 --> 00:27:34.277
Everything matters.
Everything is so particular in ballet.

534
00:27:34.361 --> 00:27:36.696
She might not have the perfect legs
and feet. I didn't.

535
00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:38.239
Most people don't.

536
00:27:38.323 --> 00:27:41.034
Most people that do ballet
do not have perfect legs and feet.

537
00:27:41.117 --> 00:27:43.536
It's something you've worked for.

538
00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:44.954
Turnout you've worked for.

539
00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:48.208
You don't-- don't just come out going.
"Chick-a-bah."

540
00:27:48.291 --> 00:27:49.334
Some people do.

541
00:27:50.418 --> 00:27:51.961
but most of us don't.

542
00:27:52.921 --> 00:27:54.506
[soothing music playing]

543
00:28:07.185 --> 00:28:10.355
There have been times
where I was so down on myself

544
00:28:10.438 --> 00:28:13.400
about my body and just. like. so. ugh.

545
00:28:13.483 --> 00:28:16.736
like. negative and insecure about it.

546
00:28:20.865 --> 00:28:21.783
But… [exhales]

547
00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.204
I had to stop playing the victim…

548
00:28:27.455 --> 00:28:28.623
towards myself.

549
00:28:29.499 --> 00:28:33.378
There was a moment where I realized.
like. "Look. if I wanna do this.

550
00:28:34.045 --> 00:28:36.631
I have to figure out
what's gonna work for me."

551
00:28:39.509 --> 00:28:41.261
But what was hard was understanding

552
00:28:41.344 --> 00:28:45.640
that the craft that chose me
was not created in my image.

553
00:28:45.724 --> 00:28:48.226
and that was a really hard realization.

554
00:28:49.144 --> 00:28:52.272
But. at the same time.
you know. this craft chose me.

555
00:28:52.355 --> 00:28:55.859
I have no choice but to do it
and to give it my all.

556
00:28:55.942 --> 00:28:58.903
-[classical music playing]
-[Debbie speaking indistinctly]

557
00:29:01.364 --> 00:29:03.116
[Debbie] You know. in Russia. they…

558
00:29:03.199 --> 00:29:07.036
x-ray the children's feet
and their backs and their bodies

559
00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.413
before they even accept them.

560
00:29:09.038 --> 00:29:11.791
Well. I mean. that's the world of ballet.

561
00:29:11.875 --> 00:29:13.293
[dramatic music playing]

562
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:22.010
In a opera. uh. they will select
only children who have voice.

563
00:29:24.888 --> 00:29:27.348
They cannot make a voice. It is gift.

564
00:29:27.432 --> 00:29:29.642
Same things with a ballet facility.

565
00:29:29.726 --> 00:29:33.271
They have to have certain physiques
for that.

566
00:29:34.439 --> 00:29:35.732
You cannot make it.

567
00:29:37.817 --> 00:29:40.904
The Kirov
and the Russian method is important.

568
00:29:40.987 --> 00:29:44.240
It is the technique
that I love the best to teach.

569
00:29:45.241 --> 00:29:48.620
And that's why we have Madame Giana
who's from the Bolshoi.

570
00:29:48.703 --> 00:29:51.664
But the dance world is evolving.

571
00:29:51.748 --> 00:29:56.544
so I'm reinventing a bit.
for the teachers.

572
00:29:57.378 --> 00:30:00.256
what their mission is
and how they go about it.

573
00:30:00.965 --> 00:30:02.550
I want the spirit of the dance.

574
00:30:02.634 --> 00:30:05.303
That's not something
you can take a picture of.

575
00:30:05.386 --> 00:30:07.764
That's something you feel and you see.

576
00:30:07.847 --> 00:30:09.098
You experience.

577
00:30:09.182 --> 00:30:10.975
One. two. Not bad.

579
00:30:13.937 --> 00:30:16.314
Okay. not that bad. Go back.

580
00:30:16.981 --> 00:30:18.233
It actually helped.

581
00:30:18.983 --> 00:30:20.068

00:30:20.151 --> 00:30:22.737
I'm sorry. Madame Giana.
it looked better.

583
00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:24.030
No. no. I disagree.

584
00:30:24.113 --> 00:30:26.074
-Because they look like this.
-I disagree.

00:30:26.157 --> 00:30:27.951
-It's okay. It's all right.
-It's "Oh!

Some of you. uh. don't have the timing.
and you're a little stiff.

You know. you've gotta relax.

593
00:30:46.052 --> 00:30:48.805
I'm sorry. but I have to just say
what I'm seeing right now

594
00:30:48.888 --> 00:30:51.099
because. um. we don't have a lot of time.

595
00:30:51.182 --> 00:30:54.143
And either they're doing it right
right now. or they're not.

Even though we're gonna clean it.

But I know. technically.
if somebody's going like this.

Okay. go back to the beginning.

It's better. You know it is.

[classical musical playing]

610
00:31:35.643 --> 00:31:42.609
[Debbie] The teachers are so vested
and so dedicated to these young people.

611
00:31:43.276 --> 00:31:45.486
They go home with them.
They give them food.

612
00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:48.781
They'll scold them
if they need to pull them together.

613
00:31:49.365 --> 00:31:50.533
You know. we go in.

614
00:31:50.617 --> 00:31:53.453
We're raising--
we're helping to raise these kids.

615
00:32:18.144 --> 00:32:21.064
I grew up in Houston. Texas.
Everything was segregated.

616
00:32:21.147 --> 00:32:24.442
You know. white water fountain only.

617
00:32:25.026 --> 00:32:27.403
colored bathroom…
We had experienced all that.

618
00:32:28.029 --> 00:32:29.489
There was a great dance school.

619
00:32:29.572 --> 00:32:31.991
but I was not allowed to go
because I was Black.

620
00:32:33.326 --> 00:32:36.746
But I was very serious early on.
I knew I really wanted it and…

621
00:32:37.246 --> 00:32:40.875
My mom always says
that. when I was eight years old.

622
00:32:40.959 --> 00:32:43.711
I said to her.
"Mom. I'm trying to be a dancer.

623
00:32:43.795 --> 00:32:45.838
How am I gonna get there
if I don't have lessons?

624
00:32:45.922 --> 00:32:48.091
I need real lessons. Mom.

625
00:32:48.174 --> 00:32:49.592
Real lessons."

626
00:32:52.011 --> 00:32:53.888
At 14 years old.

627
00:32:53.972 --> 00:32:57.183
I was recruited
by Madame Tatiana Semenova.

628
00:32:57.892 --> 00:32:59.978
who came from the Mariinsky school.

629
00:33:00.603 --> 00:33:04.190
I was so excited. I had to get up.
I had to go way across town.

630
00:33:04.273 --> 00:33:07.860
My Uncle Lloyd would take me.
and I-- if I had to take a bus back.

631
00:33:07.944 --> 00:33:10.154
it was two or three buses
to get back home.

632
00:33:11.364 --> 00:33:15.118
And. uh. Madame Semenova
really embraced me in class.

633
00:33:15.201 --> 00:33:19.455
It was a Ford Foundation grant
that paid for all of my classes.

634
00:33:19.539 --> 00:33:21.290
I was a full scholarship student.

635
00:33:22.041 --> 00:33:23.543
And when I danced.

636
00:33:24.419 --> 00:33:27.839
it was a big deal because the board
didn't know that I was there.

637
00:33:27.922 --> 00:33:31.759
I was there probably six or eight months

638
00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:35.596
before the board knew
there was a Black kid in the school.

639
00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.516
and some of them did not like it.

640
00:33:39.475 --> 00:33:42.061
But Madame Semenova pushed me.

641
00:33:42.145 --> 00:33:44.731
she scolded me. she humiliated me.

642
00:33:45.481 --> 00:33:46.524
and she loved me.

00:33:54.657 --> 00:33:58.119

646
00:34:00.163 --> 00:34:01.748
I grew up as a foster kid.

647
00:34:01.831 --> 00:34:04.709
This is the one thing
that saves somebody like me.

648
00:34:04.792 --> 00:34:07.462
For somebody else to see and invest in me

649
00:34:07.545 --> 00:34:11.174
and say. "We see what it is that you want.

650
00:34:11.257 --> 00:34:14.260
We're gonna help you do this
and get you from point A to point B."

651
00:34:14.343 --> 00:34:18.431
I feel like that. in itself.
is the biggest thing that changed my life.

652
00:34:20.016 --> 00:34:21.684
Boom. boom. Sit. sit. Boom. up!

653
00:34:22.977 --> 00:34:23.895
Where you at?

654
00:34:24.562 --> 00:34:25.688
I don't know.

655
00:34:25.772 --> 00:34:28.107
If you do this bang again.
I'm about to be…

656
00:34:28.191 --> 00:34:31.652
Elijah. go get me. um.
go get me a little rubber band. please?

657
00:34:31.736 --> 00:34:33.613
[chattering]

658
00:34:33.696 --> 00:34:35.156
[Elijah] Looks so cute. though.

659
00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:38.117
[chuckles] Shut up.
Shut up. Elijah. Five…

660
00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:41.496
Five. six. seven. cross.

661
00:34:41.579 --> 00:34:43.247
Cross and sit. sit.

662
00:34:43.331 --> 00:34:46.584
-I was an understudy. but I came--
-Yeah. Griffin…

663
00:34:46.667 --> 00:34:48.920
Miss Chantel said
I could be in "Candy Cane." so…

664
00:34:49.003 --> 00:34:52.840
Yeah. he was first an understudy.
but then he started trying to dance.

665
00:34:52.924 --> 00:34:57.720
He's tr-- trying really. really hard.
and then he ended up being in the show.

666
00:34:57.804 --> 00:35:02.433
"Candy Cane" is fun. It's hip-hop. so…
you just hype and fun and full out and…

667
00:35:02.517 --> 00:35:04.060
Yeah. "Candy Cane" is really fun.

668
00:35:04.143 --> 00:35:06.312
"Candy Cane." it's an all-boys scene.

669
00:35:06.854 --> 00:35:10.358
and it's hip-hop. and hip-hop's
one of my favorite styles. so…

670
00:35:10.858 --> 00:35:13.486
Unfortunately. I can't be in it.
but it's my favorite scene.

671
00:35:13.569 --> 00:35:16.447
"Candy Cane" is for the boys.
"Fairyland" is the girls.

672
00:35:16.531 --> 00:35:17.573
You gotta have the--

673
00:35:17.657 --> 00:35:20.785
You know. DADA has always had
more boys than any school.

674
00:35:20.868 --> 00:35:23.496
It's because I'm pushing them
and I want them.

675
00:35:23.579 --> 00:35:26.124
And I have to--
I have to have something to give them.

676
00:35:26.207 --> 00:35:28.292
[Chantel] Olivia. go in the center.

677
00:35:31.379 --> 00:35:32.755
Scoot back. back up.

678
00:35:32.839 --> 00:35:35.341
[female dancer]
My favorite scene would be "Candy Cane."

679
00:35:35.424 --> 00:35:37.218
It's. like. the only hip-hop in the show.

680
00:35:37.301 --> 00:35:38.761
It's all boys.

681
00:35:38.845 --> 00:35:41.639
Six. five. behind him.

682
00:35:41.722 --> 00:35:44.809
Are you going to put the girls in?
Going to put the girls in?

683
00:35:44.892 --> 00:35:45.935
Yeah. I'm doing that.

684
00:35:46.018 --> 00:35:48.646
-I'm gonna get in trouble. but whatever.
-[chuckles] Okay.

685
00:35:48.729 --> 00:35:51.190
Da. da. da. Cross. cross. up. down.

686
00:35:51.274 --> 00:35:52.316
So I need-- Yes!

687
00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.653
I need to see cross. up…
That's almost like a élevé.

688
00:35:55.736 --> 00:36:00.158
Over my dead body.
No girls in "Candy Cane." [laughs]

689
00:36:00.241 --> 00:36:03.327
-Yeah. that's not happening. No girls.
-It got around.

690
00:36:03.411 --> 00:36:05.997
It almost happened. though.
but. you know. it's okay.

691
00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.332
-I'm in everything else. so…
-[laughs]

692
00:36:08.416 --> 00:36:11.961
Sorry. girls. You know.
it's only us. you know. [giggles]

693
00:36:12.044 --> 00:36:13.671
-[hip-hop music playing]
-[Debbie] Yeah.

694
00:36:14.881 --> 00:36:16.174
Wow!

695
00:36:16.924 --> 00:36:18.092
Wow!

696
00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:25.892
[man] Oh. it's definitely muscle memory.
When you have Chantel Heath

697
00:36:25.975 --> 00:36:28.519
taking you to the depths
of. like. yourself.

698
00:36:28.603 --> 00:36:30.062
you won't forget it too much.

699
00:36:30.146 --> 00:36:32.273
[laughs. vocalizes]

700
00:36:32.356 --> 00:36:33.482
Now run! [laughs]

701
00:36:33.566 --> 00:36:36.444
And one. and two. down. bring it up.

702
00:36:36.527 --> 00:36:37.570
Yeah.

703
00:36:37.653 --> 00:36:41.616
Slide. one. two. Yup. it's--
The whole thing is still there.

704
00:36:41.699 --> 00:36:45.578
[dancers chant]
Who are we? Candy Cane!

705
00:36:45.661 --> 00:36:48.873
[Chantel vocalizing rhythm]

706
00:36:48.956 --> 00:36:52.543
Throw! [vocalizing rhythm]

707
00:36:52.627 --> 00:36:54.003
Turn. and one.

708
00:36:54.837 --> 00:36:56.088
It's no joke. huh?

709
00:36:57.298 --> 00:37:00.468
Some boys fall apart.
Some boys don't make it. I mean…

710
00:37:01.052 --> 00:37:03.721
You know. they're like. "Oh. my God.
That was hard. that was hard."

711
00:37:03.804 --> 00:37:05.097
I know. sit down.

712
00:37:05.181 --> 00:37:06.265
Just a second.

713
00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:09.393
What I know is. if I was doing it. I'd be…

714
00:37:09.477 --> 00:37:11.854
still dancing right now
'cause the song would still be on.

715
00:37:11.938 --> 00:37:13.648
Let's get it. All right. show's on!
Let's go!

716
00:37:13.731 --> 00:37:15.733
But I tell them.
"Keep coming back. keep coming back.

717
00:37:15.816 --> 00:37:17.652
because one of these days.
you're gonna get it."

718
00:37:17.735 --> 00:37:19.528
I don't know if everyone sticks with it.

719
00:37:19.612 --> 00:37:24.951
but I know for a fact that. if you
are here longer than a-- a semester.

720
00:37:25.034 --> 00:37:27.745
me. personally. that it's inside you.

721
00:37:27.828 --> 00:37:29.497
[Chantel]
Boom. boom. sit. sit! Boom. boom…

722
00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.791
I've been walking
through the hall. but actually

723
00:37:31.874 --> 00:37:34.460
in the studio for a class here.
it's been a while.

724
00:37:36.629 --> 00:37:40.758
It's like…
That was a lot of sweat in these floors.

725
00:37:41.384 --> 00:37:44.095
If somebody like lifted up
history out of these floors.

726
00:37:44.178 --> 00:37:46.847
it would be kinda gross. but inspiring.

727
00:37:48.266 --> 00:37:50.226
I played
the first Hot Chocolate Nutcracker

728
00:37:50.309 --> 00:37:51.769
in the first production.

729
00:37:53.813 --> 00:37:56.315
I left my biological family behind
when I was 13.

730
00:37:56.816 --> 00:37:59.777
My mother and my three sisters
moved to Arizona. and I--

731
00:38:00.278 --> 00:38:03.406
My mom made the conscious decision
to allow me to stay here.

732
00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.409
So I moved in
with Miss Harris. Mama Harris.

733
00:38:07.076 --> 00:38:10.079
and then I got full scholarship
in dance here.

734
00:38:10.162 --> 00:38:12.498
The first time
I was the Little Nutcracker. it felt like.

735
00:38:12.581 --> 00:38:15.793
"I'm-- I'm one of the principal roles. I--

736
00:38:16.627 --> 00:38:19.130
Oh. cool!"
It was. like. Miss Allen believed in me.

737
00:38:19.213 --> 00:38:21.132
[up-tempo classical music playing]

738
00:38:24.218 --> 00:38:26.804
Now. Ryan Phuong.
he's the Little Nutcracker.

739
00:38:40.526 --> 00:38:44.155
Thank God I did it first
because I would not wanna follow him.

740
00:38:44.238 --> 00:38:45.281
[chuckles]

741
00:39:01.797 --> 00:39:04.550
[Debbie] I want it to be magical.
You can't just go over here

742
00:39:04.633 --> 00:39:07.428
and hit fourth position
like a Degas statue.

743
00:39:07.511 --> 00:39:09.013
and go here.

744
00:39:09.096 --> 00:39:10.014
No!

745
00:39:10.097 --> 00:39:12.516
It's the Hot Chocolate Nutcracker. honey.

746
00:39:13.059 --> 00:39:15.811
Alive! It's like.
"Oh. my God. look at him!"

747
00:39:15.936 --> 00:39:17.563
[gasps. sighs] Oh!

748
00:39:17.646 --> 00:39:19.023
It's gotta be that.

749
00:39:19.106 --> 00:39:21.150
Look at me. Stop. Look at him!

750
00:39:21.233 --> 00:39:23.402
You're so busy looking at yourselves.

751
00:39:23.486 --> 00:39:25.571
Play the scene. [gasps]

752
00:39:26.155 --> 00:39:28.032
"Oh. my God. he's moving!

753
00:39:28.115 --> 00:39:29.533
Look at him! [gasps]

754
00:39:29.617 --> 00:39:31.786
Oh. my God. I touched him!
Oh. my God. he's coming!

755
00:39:31.869 --> 00:39:33.329
Oh. my God! Oh. my God! Okay.

756
00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:35.831
-[giggles]
-[all laugh]

757
00:39:35.915 --> 00:39:37.666
Oh. my God! Ah!"

758
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:39.251
It should be like that.

759
00:39:39.335 --> 00:39:42.254
I came here for. like.
an open class. for hip-hop. right?

760
00:39:42.338 --> 00:39:44.590
I think it was Chantel.
she was teaching.

761
00:39:44.673 --> 00:39:47.426
and that was the only thing
I would ever do is hip-hop.

762
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:49.345
I did not plan on doing ballet
or anything.

763
00:39:49.428 --> 00:39:51.806
This little boy.
I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

764
00:39:51.889 --> 00:39:52.890
I was like. "What?"

765
00:39:52.973 --> 00:39:54.392
[hip-hop music playing]

766
00:39:55.434 --> 00:39:58.604
You put that hip-hop music on.
you would see like this little tornado.

767
00:39:58.687 --> 00:40:01.357
like the little Tasmanian Devil. you know?
[chuckling]

768
00:40:04.485 --> 00:40:06.654
[Debbie] He's been every Nutcracker.

769
00:40:06.737 --> 00:40:10.491
He was the Littlest Nutcracker.
and now he's the young prince.

770
00:40:11.617 --> 00:40:14.870
Ryan thought he was trying
to just take some hip-hop classes.

771
00:40:14.954 --> 00:40:17.164
and that's how we reeled him in.

772
00:40:17.248 --> 00:40:19.166
We give them something that they want.

773
00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:22.378
but we teach them. in order to do that.
you gotta get this first.

774
00:40:22.461 --> 00:40:24.630
Ballet. I… You know. it's…

775
00:40:24.713 --> 00:40:27.508
For me. back then.
I thought only girls should do that.

776
00:40:27.591 --> 00:40:28.926
[classical music playing]

777
00:40:29.927 --> 00:40:32.638
I was really terrified to take class.

778
00:40:34.223 --> 00:40:36.725
[Giana] Ballet training. very tough.

779
00:40:36.809 --> 00:40:40.104
Who will go through the ballet training

780
00:40:40.187 --> 00:40:43.399
and finish that ballet training.

781
00:40:43.482 --> 00:40:47.278
they have strong personality
to go further.

782
00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:50.197
And Miss Allen told me.

783
00:40:50.948 --> 00:40:52.616
who she is.

784
00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:57.538
it's because she went through th--
that tough. strong ballet training.

785
00:41:00.291 --> 00:41:03.711
[Debbie] I went to the North Carolina
School of the Arts to audition.

786
00:41:03.794 --> 00:41:06.964
after I'd been trained
by the Houston Ballet Foundation.

787
00:41:07.465 --> 00:41:09.884
I was so hopeful about that.

788
00:41:09.967 --> 00:41:13.554
and they used me in the audition
to demonstrate.

789
00:41:13.637 --> 00:41:16.140
and when it was over.
I went to the man and said.

790
00:41:16.223 --> 00:41:19.435
"Well. I just wanna know. how--
when would we start?

791
00:41:19.518 --> 00:41:20.978
How is this gonna go?"

792
00:41:21.061 --> 00:41:23.355
And he told me
I was not gonna be accepted.

793
00:41:23.439 --> 00:41:25.733
and that I was not right for dance.

794
00:41:25.816 --> 00:41:28.444
and my body wasn't right.
and I should do something else.

795
00:41:28.527 --> 00:41:30.321
And It broke her spirit.

796
00:41:30.404 --> 00:41:32.531
And she stopped dancing for a year or two.

797
00:41:33.365 --> 00:41:35.201
[Debbie] It was very discouraging.

798
00:41:35.284 --> 00:41:38.078
He told me. you know.
"Definitely don't think about ballet.

799
00:41:38.162 --> 00:41:39.955
Just forget it." and. um…

800
00:41:40.414 --> 00:41:42.082
Wow. that was hard.

801
00:41:43.042 --> 00:41:46.128
So when I came back home
and it was time to go to college.

802
00:41:46.837 --> 00:41:48.756
I was accepted to Howard University.

803
00:41:49.381 --> 00:41:53.385
and so I was. like.
"Okay. I have to let the dance go.

804
00:41:53.469 --> 00:41:56.305
I love it. but it doesn't love me."

805
00:41:57.056 --> 00:41:58.265
And it was hard.

806
00:41:58.349 --> 00:42:02.937
My mom just was really brokenhearted
when I got off that plane.

807
00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:04.688
That was the hardest part.

808
00:42:05.773 --> 00:42:07.900
You know. when I got off that plane.

809
00:42:08.651 --> 00:42:11.862
and she was at the airport.
and she met me in tears.

810
00:42:12.571 --> 00:42:14.740
And she said. "Deborah. you failed."

811
00:42:16.909 --> 00:42:18.327
"Deborah. you failed."

812
00:42:23.207 --> 00:42:24.667
[inspirational music playing]

813
00:42:30.965 --> 00:42:34.134
My mom said. "You come home this summer.
you don't go and dance.

814
00:42:34.218 --> 00:42:37.137
I'm gonna save the money
that I've been putting aside

815
00:42:37.221 --> 00:42:38.847
to send you away to dance

816
00:42:39.431 --> 00:42:40.558
and buy a car."

817
00:42:40.641 --> 00:42:43.018
I'm like.
"No! No. Mom. no. No. I want to."

818
00:42:43.561 --> 00:42:46.105
And that was the summer
that I met Martha Graham

819
00:42:46.689 --> 00:42:48.274
and Meredith Monk

820
00:42:48.357 --> 00:42:49.817
and Twyla Tharp

821
00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:50.985
and Alvin Ailey.

822
00:42:51.068 --> 00:42:54.947
It was a new wave of dancers
who were breaking the traditional mold.

823
00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:57.658
doing something new and exciting.

824
00:42:57.741 --> 00:43:00.202
When I saw Alvin Ailey.
it was everything for me.

825
00:43:00.286 --> 00:43:03.664
I was like. "Child. take these snowshoes.
honey. put them somewhere else.

826
00:43:03.747 --> 00:43:06.375
I wanna dance about feelings."

827
00:43:13.799 --> 00:43:14.883
[rhythmic tapping]

828
00:43:18.721 --> 00:43:22.266
I've been trying
for years to f-- figure out

829
00:43:22.349 --> 00:43:27.104
what-- how could I really use
the language of tap in the show.

830
00:43:27.187 --> 00:43:29.231
This year. Savion Glover's coming.

831
00:43:30.858 --> 00:43:33.611
I've asked him to create
a piece called "The Train."

832
00:43:33.694 --> 00:43:37.156
[scatting on drumbeat]

833
00:43:37.239 --> 00:43:40.326
[Savion]
Miss Debbie Allen had an idea early on.

834
00:43:40.409 --> 00:43:42.620
and then she put that idea

835
00:43:43.287 --> 00:43:45.664
in my thought process.
and I was thinking about it

836
00:43:45.748 --> 00:43:47.458
for the whole time.
and then I came back.

837
00:43:47.541 --> 00:43:49.877
and. um. I was ready to go.

838
00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:53.589
And her idea was that. you know.
to get this train thing moving.

839
00:43:53.672 --> 00:43:55.841
to get us from one scene to the next.

840
00:44:00.387 --> 00:44:02.181
[Debbie] Thank you. Thank you!

841
00:44:02.264 --> 00:44:04.975
Beyond the choreography.
I just want them to come out

842
00:44:05.059 --> 00:44:06.518
with a sense of empowerment.

843
00:44:07.603 --> 00:44:10.939
a sense of greatness.
a sense of achievement.

844
00:44:11.023 --> 00:44:12.941
a sense of expression!

845
00:44:13.025 --> 00:44:18.072
This ability to think
about making someone think differently.

846
00:44:21.617 --> 00:44:23.035
[girl] That was just my style.

847
00:44:23.118 --> 00:44:25.746
He just told me
to freestyle at the beginning.

848
00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:30.292
and so I just created my own little thing
at the beginning and end.

849
00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:42.388
I wanna be just available
as a human being.

850
00:44:42.471 --> 00:44:47.017
and I like that exchange.
that allows me to learn from them.

851
00:44:48.352 --> 00:44:51.271
And hopefully. they learn from me.

852
00:44:51.355 --> 00:44:53.482
-[drumming]
-[cymbal crashes]

853
00:45:01.281 --> 00:45:02.741
[Debbie] We're gonna have a session--

854
00:45:02.825 --> 00:45:05.828
We're gonna start having sessions
during the week

855
00:45:06.453 --> 00:45:09.832
because. otherwise.
I don't think you're gonna get there.

856
00:45:09.915 --> 00:45:13.836
and I-- I need to rearrange
some of your places.

857
00:45:16.463 --> 00:45:19.133
And they're just
not getting the doll dance.

858
00:45:19.216 --> 00:45:23.429
and I don't want them
to be on stage and not look fantastic.

859
00:45:23.512 --> 00:45:26.765
I just got kicked out of "Dolls."
like my sister too.

860
00:45:26.849 --> 00:45:31.395
'Cause. um. she wants me
to be in the party scene.

861
00:45:34.606 --> 00:45:38.360
[Eartha loudly] So you've gotta be in it
from the very top.

862
00:45:38.861 --> 00:45:41.238
I can't be a monkey over here like this.

863
00:45:42.948 --> 00:45:43.907
[man] Ooh.

864
00:45:43.991 --> 00:45:45.659
I'm ready for fairies.

865
00:45:46.618 --> 00:45:49.621
so when y'all in that wings.
I want y'all like this.

866
00:45:50.164 --> 00:45:51.749
Ready to go!

867
00:45:52.458 --> 00:45:55.252
I need arms swinging.
What happened to that?

868
00:45:55.335 --> 00:45:59.339
[shouting] And a one. two. three. four.

869
00:45:59.423 --> 00:46:02.885
And a up. up. up. up.

870
00:46:02.968 --> 00:46:04.595
Yes. Tobal!

871
00:46:04.678 --> 00:46:05.637
[all cheering]

872
00:46:07.306 --> 00:46:09.850
[Eartha]
I need to make her a monkey. [laughs]

873
00:46:13.353 --> 00:46:16.482
-I'm the-- Yes!
-[male instructor laughing]

874
00:46:17.357 --> 00:46:20.110
[sighs] Come on. girl. get in there.

875
00:46:20.778 --> 00:46:22.654
-[dancers cheering]
-[Eartha laughs]

876
00:46:23.739 --> 00:46:25.991
I got the job of doing "Rainforest."

877
00:46:26.074 --> 00:46:30.204
and "Rainforest"
is one of the biggest production numbers

878
00:46:30.287 --> 00:46:31.163
in the show.

879
00:46:31.246 --> 00:46:33.457
[tribal music playing]

880
00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:36.710
[Debbie]
"Rainforest" is beautiful. Butterflies.

881
00:46:36.794 --> 00:46:39.087
monkeys. panthers.

882
00:46:39.922 --> 00:46:40.756
[panther roars]

883
00:46:41.673 --> 00:46:45.677
When you think about herds of animals
on the plains in Africa.

884
00:46:45.761 --> 00:46:48.597
the migration.
everyone's going in the same direction.

885
00:46:49.389 --> 00:46:52.601
and so there is a--
a journey that's taking place.

886
00:46:54.895 --> 00:46:57.439
Oh. my God. how big is the cast?

887
00:46:57.523 --> 00:46:59.691
You know. I don't wanna say it out loud!

888
00:46:59.775 --> 00:47:01.819
Delorse. my costumer. might slap me.

889
00:47:01.902 --> 00:47:03.570
When she saw the cast of people.

890
00:47:03.654 --> 00:47:06.907
she said. "Miss Allen. really?"
I'm like. "Yeah. Delorse."

891
00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:08.617
[loud chattering]

892
00:47:09.243 --> 00:47:11.328
Shh. No more talking. please.

893
00:47:11.411 --> 00:47:14.540
Who does not have a costume? Hm?

894
00:47:14.623 --> 00:47:16.959
[Delorse]
Well. we have a cast of almost 200.

895
00:47:18.043 --> 00:47:21.964
Each person is wearing.
you know. three-- two to three things.

896
00:47:22.047 --> 00:47:23.423
Some kids are wearing five.

897
00:47:24.341 --> 00:47:25.634
Okay. girls.

898
00:47:26.385 --> 00:47:28.095
She went to go get more costumes.

899
00:47:28.178 --> 00:47:31.223
[loudly] I still hear talking. Okay!

900
00:47:31.306 --> 00:47:33.892
We're just… It's a little busy.

901
00:47:33.976 --> 00:47:35.644
Everybody like their costumes?

902
00:47:35.727 --> 00:47:38.522
-[kids] Yes!
-Excellent.

903
00:47:38.605 --> 00:47:40.566
[Debbie] That's two people missing.

904
00:47:40.649 --> 00:47:42.317
Oh! One. two. There's two.

905
00:47:42.943 --> 00:47:45.028
-Who's missing?
-[costume helper] JoAnn and AuDrya.

906
00:47:45.112 --> 00:47:46.446
[Debbie] And where are they?

907
00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:48.574
Some lady was trying
to say JoAnn hit her car.

908
00:47:48.657 --> 00:47:50.784
but she didn't.
so they're on their way. [chuckles]

909
00:47:53.495 --> 00:47:56.832
I was eight
when I started at DADA.

910
00:47:57.875 --> 00:48:02.296
This year. I've been kinda like
getting there when I wanted to.

911
00:48:02.379 --> 00:48:04.923
like. just trying to be a teenager.
I guess.

912
00:48:05.007 --> 00:48:06.049
[Debbie shouts] JoAnn!

913
00:48:06.133 --> 00:48:08.176
You don't just walk in my rehearsal.
What happened?

914
00:48:08.802 --> 00:48:10.470
-For what?
-[JoAnn] Speeding.

915
00:48:10.554 --> 00:48:11.388
Stay here.

916
00:48:14.433 --> 00:48:15.934
One. plié.

917
00:48:16.018 --> 00:48:17.477
Go warm up at the bar.

918
00:48:17.561 --> 00:48:19.021
One. plié.

919
00:48:19.855 --> 00:48:22.566
And down. down…

920
00:48:22.649 --> 00:48:25.944
[JoAnn] Whenever I feel
that I let her down. it was very…

921
00:48:26.778 --> 00:48:28.822
[sighs] Like. it got to me every time.

922
00:48:28.906 --> 00:48:31.241
So. I'm like.
"Dang. I can't let her down no more.

923
00:48:31.325 --> 00:48:32.618
We can't have these talks.

924
00:48:32.701 --> 00:48:35.787
The next few talks we have to have
have to be good talks."

925
00:48:35.871 --> 00:48:40.208
[laughs] Like. instead of just
her telling me to get it together.

926
00:48:40.292 --> 00:48:41.668
It takes a lot.

927
00:48:42.294 --> 00:48:45.547
I don't know.
I think it comes down to heart and will

928
00:48:45.631 --> 00:48:48.467
and wanting it for yourself.
wanting something more.

929
00:48:49.217 --> 00:48:50.052
And…

930
00:48:51.011 --> 00:48:51.845
Yeah.

931
00:48:52.304 --> 00:48:53.805
Working your butt off.

932
00:48:53.889 --> 00:48:58.727
I'm trying to help you
learn professional work ethic.

933
00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:00.270
Say "work ethic."

934
00:49:00.354 --> 00:49:01.271
[dancers] Work ethic.

935
00:49:01.355 --> 00:49:02.564
Work ethic.

936
00:49:02.648 --> 00:49:03.732
[dancers] Work ethic.

937
00:49:03.815 --> 00:49:06.193
This should apply
to everything you do in life.

938
00:49:06.276 --> 00:49:09.363
Your homework.
how you do your work at school.

939
00:49:09.446 --> 00:49:10.405
what other jobs

940
00:49:10.489 --> 00:49:13.617
and other career aspirations
that you have.

941
00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:17.329
If you work in the post office.
if you are a teacher.

942
00:49:17.412 --> 00:49:20.123
if you are a maintenance person.

943
00:49:20.207 --> 00:49:22.709
if you work in Washington.

944
00:49:22.793 --> 00:49:25.462
your work ethic must be the same.

945
00:49:25.963 --> 00:49:30.133
If you work with children.
your work ethic should even be better.

946
00:49:30.217 --> 00:49:32.844
Adolescence is difficult.

947
00:49:33.345 --> 00:49:36.932
and it's sort of like
your mind leaves you for a bit

948
00:49:37.015 --> 00:49:39.142
and you're just sort of out in orbit.

949
00:49:39.226 --> 00:49:42.688
You're exploring yourself.
you're exploring things around you.

950
00:49:42.771 --> 00:49:47.067
but the fact that you have something
to go to three or four times a week

951
00:49:47.693 --> 00:49:49.820
and be responsible to

952
00:49:49.903 --> 00:49:51.446
helps you be responsible

953
00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:54.449
with your school work.
your homework. your chores at home.

954
00:49:54.533 --> 00:49:58.370
and it gives you a sense of gratitude.

955
00:49:58.453 --> 00:50:01.081
How do you think
you're going to get where we are?

956
00:50:01.164 --> 00:50:03.542
Where are you trying to go in life?

957
00:50:04.042 --> 00:50:07.170
Every day
is not just a rehearsal for Nutcracker.

958
00:50:07.254 --> 00:50:09.798
it's a rehearsal
for the rest of your life.

959
00:50:09.881 --> 00:50:11.216
You come in here late.

960
00:50:11.299 --> 00:50:14.511
that's where you're gonna be
on your next job. and you're fired.

961
00:50:15.012 --> 00:50:18.181
You walk into a Broadway show late.
you're fired.

962
00:50:18.682 --> 00:50:22.019
The understudy is on.
They don't care how much they like you.

963
00:50:22.102 --> 00:50:24.021
You're not professional.

964
00:50:24.104 --> 00:50:25.814
-Do you understand?
-[dancers] Yes.

965
00:50:25.897 --> 00:50:29.651
Every day is your rehearsal for life.
not just the Nutcracker.

966
00:50:29.735 --> 00:50:32.070
Take it seriously. Make it into something.

967
00:50:33.113 --> 00:50:35.532
We have a lot of work to do.
I wanted to see you…

968
00:50:35.615 --> 00:50:38.869
Look. we're not in a bad place.
but we have literally a month.

969
00:50:38.952 --> 00:50:42.205
which means we don't have a month
'cause we don't rehearse every day.

970
00:50:42.289 --> 00:50:44.416
-So this is your homework.
-Thank you. Miss Allen.

971
00:50:44.499 --> 00:50:45.834
[dancers] Thank you. Miss Allen.

972
00:50:45.917 --> 00:50:48.003
[Debbie shouts]
Don't come to my rehearsal late.

973
00:50:48.545 --> 00:50:51.423
Don't come to any rehearsal late again.
and I mean it.

974
00:50:51.506 --> 00:50:52.632
Thank you. Dismissed.

975
00:50:52.716 --> 00:50:55.135
-[dancers] Thank you. Miss Allen.
-Thank you. Miss Cathie.

976
00:50:55.218 --> 00:50:56.970
-Thank you.
-[Debbie] Yes.

977
00:50:57.054 --> 00:50:58.555
-Thank you.
-Yes.

978
00:50:59.264 --> 00:51:00.640
-Yes.
-Thank you.

979
00:51:00.724 --> 00:51:02.142
Don't come late. AuDrya.

980
00:51:02.768 --> 00:51:04.394
If you're late. just stay out.

981
00:51:04.478 --> 00:51:05.353
-Thank you.
-Yes.

982
00:51:05.437 --> 00:51:06.605
-Thank you. Miss Allen.
-Yes.

983
00:51:06.688 --> 00:51:08.273
-Thank you.
-Hmm!

984
00:51:08.899 --> 00:51:09.983
Mm-mm.

985
00:51:10.692 --> 00:51:12.277
-Thank you. Miss Allen.
-Yes.

986
00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:14.654
-Thank you. Miss Allen.
-More joy. You're beautiful.

987
00:51:14.738 --> 00:51:16.698
No. do you know how beautiful you are?

988
00:51:16.782 --> 00:51:18.158
I don't think you do.

989
00:51:18.241 --> 00:51:20.118
You're so beautiful.

990
00:51:20.702 --> 00:51:23.288
Embody that. Embrace that when you dance.

991
00:51:23.371 --> 00:51:24.206
Go away.

992
00:51:24.831 --> 00:51:25.665
Yes.

993
00:51:25.749 --> 00:51:27.667
Thank you. Get rid of those nails.

994
00:51:27.751 --> 00:51:29.628
-Thank you. Miss Allen.
-Yes.

995
00:51:29.711 --> 00:51:30.962
Thank you. You'll be doing it.

996
00:51:31.046 --> 00:51:37.469
[Karen] The window of opportunity
to enter in the dance world is small.

997
00:51:37.552 --> 00:51:40.097
You have to do it by a certain time.

998
00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:42.599
You have to pull yourself up

999
00:51:42.682 --> 00:51:47.395
in a way that. by the time
you definitely are out of high school.

1000
00:51:47.479 --> 00:51:50.065
you have to be able
to audition and compete.

1001
00:51:51.066 --> 00:51:55.779
April. you come from this side of stage.
and you basically tell them all to come.

1002
00:51:55.862 --> 00:51:58.698
[April]
I auditioned for Dance Theatre of Harlem.

1003
00:51:58.782 --> 00:52:01.827
and I wasn't accepted into the company.

1004
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:03.578
Then I was auditioning for other places.

1005
00:52:03.662 --> 00:52:06.331
thinking that I would get in
somewhere else.

1006
00:52:06.414 --> 00:52:07.749
but it just didn't happen.

1007
00:52:09.292 --> 00:52:10.544
Like. as a dancer.

1008
00:52:10.627 --> 00:52:14.339
you're always trying
to find the next place to go

1009
00:52:14.422 --> 00:52:15.966
or trying to improve.

1010
00:52:16.049 --> 00:52:19.594
And sometimes. it feels like.
you know. you're just stuck auditioning

1011
00:52:19.678 --> 00:52:21.471
and not getting anything.

1012
00:52:21.555 --> 00:52:24.391
So. it's just. like.
the life of a dancer is very hard.

1013
00:52:24.474 --> 00:52:27.644
but. like. I can't imagine myself
doing anything else.

1014
00:52:29.104 --> 00:52:32.607
[Savoy] I applied to 12 schools.
I would always say. when I was younger.

1015
00:52:32.691 --> 00:52:35.402
I was like. "I'm applying for dance.
I don't have to do anything.

1016
00:52:35.485 --> 00:52:37.028
My grades don't matter.
Nothing matters.

1017
00:52:37.112 --> 00:52:39.823
I'm just gonna dance." And like. no.

1018
00:52:39.906 --> 00:52:41.658
Like. it's honestly. like. worse.

1019
00:52:42.242 --> 00:52:43.869
So. I'm freaking out a little bit.

1020
00:52:43.952 --> 00:52:49.332
It takes so much focus to succeed.

1021
00:52:49.416 --> 00:52:51.585
You can't let things get you down.

1022
00:52:51.668 --> 00:52:53.628
Whether your teacher is too mean.

1023
00:52:53.712 --> 00:52:55.213
or it's too easy.

1024
00:52:55.797 --> 00:52:58.383
you can't let it disturb you.

1025
00:52:58.466 --> 00:53:00.927
[Eartha] Six. hold. Up!

1026
00:53:01.011 --> 00:53:02.387
I need to learn that too…

1027
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:06.183
because I do the same thing still.
You know what I mean?

1028
00:53:06.266 --> 00:53:09.519
I-- I-- I don't get a choreography job.
I'm immediately like.

1029
00:53:09.603 --> 00:53:12.314
"I'm not good enough. Forget it."
and I quit.

1030
00:53:12.397 --> 00:53:14.274
Up. eight.

1031
00:53:15.108 --> 00:53:18.486
We have to work hard at what we do.
I don't care if you're eight years old.

1032
00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:21.114
There's eight-year-old actors
and actresses in movies right now

1033
00:53:21.198 --> 00:53:22.741
that are doing huge scenes.

1034
00:53:23.575 --> 00:53:25.702
You have to be engaged.
it doesn't matter how young.

1035
00:53:25.785 --> 00:53:27.162
[jazzy music playing]

1036
00:53:29.331 --> 00:53:31.124
[JoAnn]
I wanted to be. like. a company dancer.

1037
00:53:31.208 --> 00:53:34.294
so I wanted to go to school.
train. train. train.

1038
00:53:34.377 --> 00:53:37.505
graduate. then. hopefully.
get into a company like Alvin Ailey.

1039
00:53:39.090 --> 00:53:43.136
Everybody has that dream.
Everybody wants to dance professionally.

1040
00:53:44.221 --> 00:53:46.223
You see that in Savoy.

1041
00:53:46.306 --> 00:53:48.391
You see that in April.

1042
00:53:48.475 --> 00:53:50.268
You see that in JoAnn.

1043
00:53:56.524 --> 00:53:58.735
[Eartha] Sometimes.
you see it in their eyes. like…

1044
00:53:59.694 --> 00:54:01.529
Are they gonna make it?
Are they gonna make it?

1045
00:54:01.613 --> 00:54:04.491
Come on. girl.
You can make it! You can make it!

1046
00:54:04.574 --> 00:54:08.536
And. uh. you know. I know a lot of people
who don't become dancers.

1047
00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:10.872
who are incredible surgeons.

1048
00:54:10.956 --> 00:54:13.458
but have dance still under their belt.

1049
00:54:16.086 --> 00:54:18.213
[Debbie]
Well. Steve Jobs took dance class.

1050
00:54:18.296 --> 00:54:19.339
He did.

1051
00:54:19.881 --> 00:54:23.927
He bailed out of his math class
to go and take dance class.

1052
00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:26.680
That says a lot to me.

1053
00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:33.770
Like. I wanna go to New York
and go to these schools.

1054
00:54:33.853 --> 00:54:36.273
but I don't think I can do it.
then my mom is like.

1055
00:54:36.356 --> 00:54:40.694
"Oh well. this Ailey scholarship audition
is coming up in New York. so…"

1056
00:54:41.945 --> 00:54:46.157
And I'm. "Wait. am I going? Are we going?"
She's like. "You and Savoy are."

1057
00:54:47.409 --> 00:54:50.704
I'm like. "Oh. wow."
So it's just us two. both 17…

1058
00:54:50.787 --> 00:54:52.872
[chuckles]
…getting on a plane by ourselves

1059
00:54:52.956 --> 00:54:55.333
and going to New York
to audition for this school.

1060
00:54:56.334 --> 00:54:58.003
And then I went to San Francisco

1061
00:54:58.086 --> 00:55:01.339
for LINES.
I felt really comfortable there.

1062
00:55:01.423 --> 00:55:03.174
Very comfortable.
So after I got a scholarship

1063
00:55:03.258 --> 00:55:04.884
to their summer program. it gave me hope.

1064
00:55:04.968 --> 00:55:06.344
"Maybe I can dance in my future."

1065
00:55:09.556 --> 00:55:11.933
-[instructor] Good job.
-[applauding]

1066
00:55:12.017 --> 00:55:16.521
Then after that. they were asking.
um. for. like. payment deadlines.

1067
00:55:16.604 --> 00:55:17.939
right after the intensive.

1068
00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:24.988
[woman] Housing for a month
in San Francisco is…

1069
00:55:25.071 --> 00:55:27.741
because they don't provide housing
at the intensives.

1070
00:55:27.824 --> 00:55:29.492
it's just off the chain.

1071
00:55:29.576 --> 00:55:30.994
And going to Ailey.

1072
00:55:31.077 --> 00:55:33.872
she wasn't awarded any scholarships.

1073
00:55:33.955 --> 00:55:36.833
so just for a summer.
to go to Ailey. or…

1074
00:55:37.709 --> 00:55:40.337
It was pretty close to.

1075
00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:42.630
with tuition and housing.

1076
00:55:43.131 --> 00:55:44.716
probably like six. seven grand.

1077
00:55:45.258 --> 00:55:46.426
And that's just not…

1078
00:55:47.677 --> 00:55:50.555
anything. as a single parent.
I-- I could ever afford.

1079
00:55:51.806 --> 00:55:55.352
Yeah. that's when I figured out.

1080
00:55:55.435 --> 00:55:57.228
"Okay. maybe dance isn't for me."

1081
00:55:58.229 --> 00:56:00.231
and things went left.

1082
00:56:00.315 --> 00:56:01.858
And then I was just like.

1083
00:56:02.776 --> 00:56:06.112
"Um. I need to find out
what I'm about to do

1084
00:56:06.196 --> 00:56:07.947
for the rest of my life." [chuckles]

1085
00:56:21.878 --> 00:56:23.463
[Chantel] See you on Wednesday.

1086
00:56:23.546 --> 00:56:24.422

1087

[shushing]

1088
00:56:31.679 --> 00:56:34.391
[Terry] I started doing aerial
a long time ago. and Debbie was like.

1089
00:56:34.474 --> 00:56:36.559
"Okay.
how can we put aerial into the show?"

1090
00:56:36.643 --> 00:56:38.603
So. we started flying the Fairy Queen.

1091
00:56:40.772 --> 00:56:44.317
This year. Kylie Jefferson and April
were both the Fairy Queen.

1092
00:56:44.401 --> 00:56:47.112
but for my shows.
I mostly worked with Kylie.

1093
00:56:47.195 --> 00:56:51.324
Kylie's like a big sister to me.
I've always looked up to her.

1094
00:56:51.408 --> 00:56:55.745
She graduated from DADA
and went to Complexions.

1095
00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:58.623
one of the best
contemporary dance companies.

1096
00:56:58.706 --> 00:57:00.083
[Terry] Okay. boom! Hover.

1097
00:57:00.166 --> 00:57:04.087
I got into my dream company.
Complexions Contemporary Ballet.

1098
00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:06.756
[Terry] Down. Now…

1099
00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:11.261
[Kylie] I had been working
with the company for a few months.

1100
00:57:11.344 --> 00:57:14.013
I went over my partner's shoulder
for a lift.

1101
00:57:14.097 --> 00:57:18.393
and I just remember
hearing something. like. pop.

1102
00:57:19.102 --> 00:57:20.270
Crack. something.

1103
00:57:20.353 --> 00:57:23.606
It was a loud noise in my rib.

1104
00:57:23.690 --> 00:57:26.901
and I screamed onstage.

1105
00:57:26.985 --> 00:57:31.573
That was probably
the worst injury that I've ever had.

1106
00:57:33.032 --> 00:57:35.618
I came offstage. and I collapsed.

1107
00:57:36.327 --> 00:57:40.748
And I was just bawling
and in tears and in so much pain.

1108
00:57:42.584 --> 00:57:44.669
I thought it was over.

1109
00:57:44.752 --> 00:57:48.089
I kinda almost. like.
wanted it to be over.

1110
00:57:48.173 --> 00:57:52.343
I was like. "I don't wanna dance anymore."
My heart was so broken.

1111
00:57:53.386 --> 00:57:55.889
In this world.
there's gonna be a lot of pain.

1112
00:57:56.431 --> 00:58:00.226
Pain to your body.
but also it can be to your feelings.

1113
00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:04.397
But you have to pull up.
and you have to measure up to that.

1114
00:58:04.481 --> 00:58:07.442
You have to get-- like the athletes.
you have to stay in the game.

1115
00:58:07.525 --> 00:58:08.735
Are you gonna stay in the game?

1116
00:58:08.818 --> 00:58:09.777
Okay.

1117
00:58:10.361 --> 00:58:13.573

Character's as important as the dancing.

1124
00:58:28.046 --> 00:58:31.216
And that's part of being onstage.
that's part of being a professional

1125
00:58:31.299 --> 00:58:33.760
is the entire package

01:01:12.543 --> 01:01:15.004
Madame opened a bottle of champagne…

1174
01:01:16.339 --> 01:01:18.091
and she told me I had to keep the cork

1175
01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:20.385
because that was good luck.
I still have the cork.

1176
01:01:21.135 --> 01:01:23.680
We sat. and she pulled out
the programs she had saved.

and other students' names

1178

1179
01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:33.481
And as we were drinking the champagne
and eating.

1180
01:01:33.564 --> 01:01:37.318
she says. "Well. you know.
I had to find you-- I had to find you."

1181
01:01:37.402 --> 01:01:39.112
I said. "What do you mean?" She says.

1182
01:01:39.195 --> 01:01:44.867
"Well. we would not keep the Ford grant
if we did not diversify the students.

1183

I needed to find a Black student."

1184
01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:52.083
And I sat there.
and it kind of took me aback

1185
01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:54.544
because I was like…

1186
01:01:56.129 --> 01:01:58.589
I thought I was chosen
because I was really good.

1187
01:01:59.215 --> 01:02:00.591
not because I was Black.

1188
01:02:02.844 --> 01:02:05.346
