01:10:08.378 --> 01:10:10.510
because it islike them
to do such a thing.

912
01:10:10.554 --> 01:10:12.295
- Oh. it's like them
to do so?

913
01:10:12.338 --> 01:10:13.339
- Yes.

914
01:10:13.383 --> 01:10:14.384
- And how
do you know this?

915
01:10:17.125 --> 01:10:18.344
- Because they
once took my wife.

916
01:10:21.347 --> 01:10:25.743
They placed her in the harem
of Abimelech their king.

917
01:10:25.786 --> 01:10:28.920
But the Lord plagued
his house and his people.

918
01:10:28.963 --> 01:10:30.138
So when he found out
she was my wife.

919
01:10:30.182 --> 01:10:31.836
he gave her back--

920
01:10:31.879 --> 01:10:35.840
along with wealth and servants
as repayment.

921
01:10:35.883 --> 01:10:37.581
And so you and your mother
entered into my household.

922
01:10:41.149 --> 01:10:42.716
Praise God Abimelech
hadn't yet lain with her.

923
01:10:46.198 --> 01:10:47.721
- That still doesn't prove
that thatman's daughter

924
01:10:47.765 --> 01:10:49.810
was taken
by men of Pelesheth.

925
01:10:49.854 --> 01:10:50.811
- No.
it doesn't.

926
01:10:50.855 --> 01:10:54.032
but the odds
are in their favor.

927
01:10:54.075 --> 01:10:57.818
Wicked kings are renowned
for storing up stolen women.

928
01:10:57.862 --> 01:11:00.473
Ask your mother
if she would disagree.

929
01:11:00.517 --> 01:11:03.215
Ultimately. however.
in this world.

930
01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:04.999
all men are capable
of such evil.

931
01:11:05.043 --> 01:11:06.131
- Even you?

932
01:11:06.174 --> 01:11:07.872
- Yes. even me.

933
01:11:07.915 --> 01:11:10.178
Apart from
my God's grace.

934
01:11:10.222 --> 01:11:11.745
allmen are capable
of much worse.

935
01:11:15.401 --> 01:11:17.882
Praise God that
He has delivered you out

936
01:11:17.925 --> 01:11:20.754
from under
such taskmasters.

937
01:11:20.798 --> 01:11:23.409
- You pride yourself
on being a safe haven

938
01:11:23.453 --> 01:11:25.063
for paganrefugees?

939
01:11:25.106 --> 01:11:27.021
- Pride myself?

940
01:11:27.065 --> 01:11:29.763
If I can point man
back to his Creator...

941
01:11:29.807 --> 01:11:31.809
then to God
be the glory.

942
01:11:31.852 --> 01:11:34.942
- Point man
back to his Creator.

943
01:11:34.986 --> 01:11:36.509
Is that
what you were doing

944
01:11:36.553 --> 01:11:38.337
when you banished your own son
with his Egyptian mother?

945
01:11:38.381 --> 01:11:40.034
- Eshcolam!

946
01:11:40.078 --> 01:11:42.776
My father will hear
of your insolence!

947
01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:46.214
- It's all right.

948
01:11:46.258 --> 01:11:48.434
I'd rather answer
his question

949
01:11:48.478 --> 01:11:50.654
and bring truth
to light

950
01:11:50.697 --> 01:11:52.308
than allow animosity
to fester.

951
01:11:59.402 --> 01:12:01.578
When Isaac
was very young.

952
01:12:01.621 --> 01:12:07.148
Ishmael's scoffing towards him
became too much to bear.

953
01:12:07.192 --> 01:12:11.892
We had seen the same contention
in his mother years before.

954
01:12:11.936 --> 01:12:14.199
Eventually. the Lord had said
to send them away.

955
01:12:14.242 --> 01:12:15.200
- The Lord said.

956
01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:20.031
- It brought me
great pain...

957
01:12:20.074 --> 01:12:21.902
but the Lord says

958
01:12:21.946 --> 01:12:25.602
He will make a great nation
of him as my seed...

959
01:12:25.645 --> 01:12:28.387
and that 12 princes
will come from his line.

960
01:12:28.431 --> 01:12:30.171
- Does that help
settle your conscience?

961
01:12:30.215 --> 01:12:31.434
- Get out!

962
01:12:31.477 --> 01:12:32.522
- I'm not finished!

963
01:12:32.565 --> 01:12:34.393
- Yes. you are!

964
01:12:34.437 --> 01:12:38.136
- You give yourself license
to do whatever you wish

965
01:12:38.179 --> 01:12:40.834
as long as you can say.
"the Lord has said!"

966
01:12:40.878 --> 01:12:42.096
Bastardize
your son--

972
01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:49.800
- I know
your intentions!

973
01:12:49.843 --> 01:12:53.064
You come plant yourself here
in my homeland

974
01:12:53.107 --> 01:12:57.460
and seek to build a slave army
to overthrow my people!

975
01:12:57.503 --> 01:12:59.200
You think you deserve
this land?!

976
01:12:59.244 --> 01:13:02.247
- No...

977
01:13:02.290 --> 01:13:04.641
no;
neither do you.

978
01:13:08.166 --> 01:13:09.602
What man deserves
any good thing in this world?

979
01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:13.824
- You expect me
to praise your God

980
01:13:13.867 --> 01:13:16.435
for giving me the privilege
of being your slave...

981
01:13:16.479 --> 01:13:18.263
...Omaster
of righteousness?!

982
01:13:18.306 --> 01:13:19.960
- That's it!

983
01:13:20.004 --> 01:13:22.136
I'm going to bring you
back home by a rope!

984
01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:23.050
Isaac.
grab the vine.

985
01:13:24.661 --> 01:13:26.924
- What torments you.
Abraham?!

986
01:13:26.967 --> 01:13:29.013
Take your hands
off me!

987
01:13:29.056 --> 01:13:30.928
Tell us what
you're hiding!

988
01:13:30.971 --> 01:13:32.320

01:13:41.329 --> 01:13:42.200

LEAD HORSEMAN:
Well done. old man.

998
01:14:28.768 --> 01:14:30.553
Seems our
warrior shepherd

999
01:14:30.596 --> 01:14:32.642
is still one to be
reckoned with...

1000
01:14:32.685 --> 01:14:35.906
even in the twilight
of his years!

1001
01:14:35.949 --> 01:14:40.127
Abram
of the Kasdim.

1002
01:14:40.171 --> 01:14:42.303
- Abraham.

1003
01:14:42.347 --> 01:14:46.699
- Having a bit
of a scuffle. are we?

1004
01:14:46.743 --> 01:14:50.007
You know. you shouldn't charge
your master like that.

1005
01:14:50.050 --> 01:14:53.227
Especially one known
to conquer kings.

1006
01:14:53.271 --> 01:14:55.012
You'll be fortunate

1007
01:14:55.055 --> 01:14:56.404
if he doesn't
put you to death for it.

1008
01:14:59.973 --> 01:15:02.498
ABRAHAM: It's only
a misunderstanding.

1009
01:15:02.541 --> 01:15:04.804
LEAD HORSEMAN:
If I'm not mistaken.

1010
01:15:04.848 --> 01:15:08.068
you were headed
to Hebron.

1011
01:15:08.112 --> 01:15:10.941
Did you miss it?

1012
01:15:10.984 --> 01:15:13.639
It's a day's walk
back thatway.

1013
01:15:13.683 --> 01:15:16.381
- "Beyond Hebron"
is what I said.

1014
01:15:16.424 --> 01:15:18.644
- Beyond...
certainly wellbeyond.

1015
01:15:22.430 --> 01:15:24.389
If you were
more truthful.

1016
01:15:24.432 --> 01:15:26.086
I would've been
more intentional

1017
01:15:26.130 --> 01:15:27.871
about collecting
a tithe

1018
01:15:27.914 --> 01:15:31.222
for the extent of which
you used my king's road.

1019
01:15:31.265 --> 01:15:33.790
- Looks to me like you've
taken enough "tithes" already!

1020
01:15:33.833 --> 01:15:36.053
- Isaac.
quiet yourself!

1021
01:15:36.096 --> 01:15:37.663
- Looks to me
you need a lesson

1022
01:15:37.707 --> 01:15:39.535
in speaking
out of turn. boy.

1023
01:15:39.578 --> 01:15:41.972
- We are far
from the coast.

1024
01:15:42.015 --> 01:15:44.888
Abimelech has no territory
this far into Canaan.

1025
01:15:44.931 --> 01:15:47.804
- Our king
is a man of ambition.

1026
01:15:47.847 --> 01:15:49.066
- And since when
does tithing

1027
01:15:49.109 --> 01:15:50.937
require robbing a poor father
of his daughter?

1028
01:15:59.424 --> 01:16:03.297
- You speak of what
you do not know. boy.

1029
01:16:03.341 --> 01:16:04.560
- Put your sword away.

1030
01:16:04.603 --> 01:16:06.126
You can take
whatever you want.

1031
01:16:06.170 --> 01:16:07.388
- I know exactly
of what I speak...

1032
01:16:09.869 --> 01:16:12.742
a man slain
on the road.

1033
01:16:12.785 --> 01:16:14.831
whose dying lips only spoke
of his stolen daughter.

1034
01:16:14.874 --> 01:16:15.832
- Isaac!

1035
01:16:15.875 --> 01:16:16.920

1036
01:16:16.963 --> 01:16:18.530
ISAAC:
You snakes!

1037
01:16:18.574 --> 01:16:21.489
You think you can flee the
condemnation that awaits you?!

1038
01:16:21.533 --> 01:16:23.927
- Come to me.

1039
01:16:23.970 --> 01:16:28.496
I will give your flesh
to the birds of the air

1040
01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:31.195
and the beasts
of the field.

1041
01:16:31.238 --> 01:16:32.762
- Let the girl go!

1042
01:16:32.805 --> 01:16:35.634
- We've come only to sacrifice
to the Lord God!

1043
01:16:35.678 --> 01:16:39.595
Take what you want;
we'll be on our way!

1044
01:16:39.638 --> 01:16:41.814
- How about I take you
as a tithe?

1045
01:16:41.858 --> 01:16:42.946
- You will not!

1046
01:16:48.821 --> 01:16:50.127
- So be it.

1047
01:16:52.999 --> 01:16:59.832
My life...
for hers.

1048
01:16:59.876 --> 01:17:02.443
COMRADE 4: She's used goods
now anyway.

1050
01:17:05.098 --> 01:17:07.013
We can make him
an effeminate!

1051
01:17:07.057 --> 01:17:09.276
- [laughing] Many in the court
will love that!

1052
01:17:11.017 --> 01:17:12.628
- You will do
nothing...

1053
01:17:12.671 --> 01:17:13.498
other than leave
right now!

1054
01:17:14.934 --> 01:17:15.979
- Stop!

1055
01:17:20.026 --> 01:17:21.941
How about I cut a tenth
of your son's body...

1056
01:17:24.596 --> 01:17:26.337
we'll call it
a day?

1057
01:17:27.686 --> 01:17:30.950
- My son
speaks the truth.

1058
01:17:30.994 --> 01:17:34.040
You cannot escape the eternal
torment that awaits you.

1059
01:17:34.084 --> 01:17:35.825
The road
you're on now

1060
01:17:35.868 --> 01:17:37.609
will only lead
to fire and flame.

1061
01:17:37.653 --> 01:17:39.089
Now.
let go of my son!

1062
01:17:40.438 --> 01:17:42.048
- Isaac!

1063
01:17:42.092 --> 01:17:42.962
- Watch out!

1064
01:17:54.844 --> 01:17:58.412
SARAH: Do not preach to me
about faith any longer.

1065
01:18:04.244 --> 01:18:09.249
If all your hopes were
dashed upon the rock...

1066
01:18:09.293 --> 01:18:14.341
and all that you loved
was lost...

1067
01:18:14.385 --> 01:18:18.171
would yourfaith
still stand?

1068
01:18:18.215 --> 01:18:20.696
Or would you curse God
to His face?

1069
01:18:31.402 --> 01:18:32.533
THE LORD:
Should I hide

1070
01:18:32.577 --> 01:18:34.535
what I am about to do
from Abraham?

1071
01:18:40.411 --> 01:18:41.760
For I have chosen him.

1072
01:18:44.894 --> 01:18:47.374
so that he will
command his children

1073
01:18:47.418 --> 01:18:49.899
and his house
after him.

1074
01:18:49.942 --> 01:18:51.596
to keep the way
of the LORD.

1075
01:18:54.338 --> 01:18:57.036
This is how the LORD
will fulfill to Abraham

1076
01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:59.386
what He promised him.

1077
01:19:09.092 --> 01:19:11.355
KELZAR:
Get away from him!

1078
01:19:11.398 --> 01:19:12.878
Don't touch him!

1079
01:19:12.922 --> 01:19:14.488
COMRADE 1:
Captain!

1080
01:19:14.532 --> 01:19:16.403
The king will have your head
if he gets word of this!

1081
01:19:16.447 --> 01:19:17.840
KELZAR:
You must leave now!

1082
01:19:17.883 --> 01:19:18.884
COMRADE 1:
It's not worth it!

1083
01:19:22.758 --> 01:19:24.455
LEAD HORSEMAN:
Saddle her up.

1084
01:19:24.498 --> 01:19:25.586
