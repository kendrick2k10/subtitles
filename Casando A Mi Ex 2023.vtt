00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:08.625
I love her a hundred percent.

4
00:00:09.833 --> 00:00:10.875
Forever.

5
00:00:11.291 --> 00:00:12.875
- A hundred percent.
- A hundred percent.

6
00:00:13.083 --> 00:00:15.750
I can't imagine myself
waking up with somebody else.

7
00:00:18.208 --> 00:00:19.708
Damn! More than a hundred.

8
00:00:20.208 --> 00:00:21.958
Two hundred percent.
right?

9
00:00:22.208 --> 00:00:24.750
Oh. sweetie!
Can you do 300?

10
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.041
We share the same life.

11
00:00:27.125 --> 00:00:28.708
the same beliefs.

12
00:00:28.916 --> 00:00:31.041
Mediocre in life.
mediocre in love.

13
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.125
We said no lies.

14
00:00:34.708 --> 00:00:36.083
This is fake. for God's sake!

15
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:37.833
Do you think I'm a fool?

16
00:00:39.916 --> 00:00:41.458
Answer me.
Do you think I'm a fool?

17
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.583
- Well. no.
- No.

18
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.833
In this country. only three people
out of a thousand get married.

19
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:49.708
and two out of three weddings
end in a divorce.

20
00:00:50.708 --> 00:00:52.500
How many friends do you have
on Facebook?

21
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:54.291
- Many.
- 1000.

22
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.250
- I don't know.
- See it.

23
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.125
- Where can I see it?
- Ah. here-!

24
00:00:58.208 --> 00:00:59.250
A thousand. maybe?

25
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:00.791
About that number.

26
00:01:00.875 --> 00:01:02.791
Only two people out of a thousand
will stay together.

27
00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:05.000
They'll grow old.
like in the movies.

28
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.416
Only two.

29
00:01:06.791 --> 00:01:08.583
Am I being too pessimistic?

30
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.291
I don't want to come off
as a killjoy.

31
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:11.583
Mariana.

32
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.583
No. every now and then it's good
to go over the top.

33
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:14.750
Why do you want to get married?

34
00:01:15.916 --> 00:01:18.791
Do you think you're the one couple
out of 500?

35
00:01:18.875 --> 00:01:20.125
I mean. you can lie
to yourselves.

36
00:01:20.208 --> 00:01:21.208
but not to me...

37
00:01:22.083 --> 00:01:23.041
No fucking way.

38
00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:25.250
I'm the best wedding planner.

39
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.291
I can't waste my time. sorry.

40
00:01:27.625 --> 00:01:29.958
I can't plan a wedding
for those who lie to themselves

41
00:01:30.083 --> 00:01:31.416
and don't love each other
a hundred percent.

42
00:01:31.541 --> 00:01:33.791
Love is the most important
thing to me.

43
00:01:34.291 --> 00:01:35.750
and I can't see it in you.

44
00:01:36.041 --> 00:01:38.416
Mariana. hold on.
Maybe they do love each other.

45
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.458
Magali. why are we doing this?
For money?

46
00:01:41.125 --> 00:01:42.583
I can't lie to them.

47
00:01:43.208 --> 00:01:44.208
Goodbye. friends.

48
00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:46.625
- No. sorry. Mariana. but we...
- No. wait. BegoÃ±a.

49
00:01:46.708 --> 00:01:48.291
Don't worry.
We'll have

50
00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:49.833
our dream wedding.

51
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.958
Someone will plan it.
Don't worry. gorgeous.

52
00:01:54.791 --> 00:01:56.666
Jose. tell her something!

53
00:01:58.166 --> 00:01:59.541
We'll be happy.

54
00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:01.541
That's the only thing that matters.
my love.

55
00:02:01.625 --> 00:02:02.708
Forever?

56
00:02:02.833 --> 00:02:04.250
Growing old.
like in the movies.

57
00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:07.625
I got them.

58
00:02:12.916 --> 00:02:14.541
You've passed the test.

59
00:02:17.875 --> 00:02:19.708
You've passed the test.

60
00:02:22.583 --> 00:02:24.666
You've passed the test.

61
00:02:27.416 --> 00:02:30.000
You just have to sign here.

62
00:02:30.375 --> 00:02:32.125
Here and here.

63
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.791
If they lie. why shouldn't I?

64
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.291
There's something I need
to confess.

65
00:02:36.708 --> 00:02:38.375
From the moment you
walked in here.

66
00:02:39.208 --> 00:02:40.333
I saw pure love.

67
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.458
And the more they pay...
the more love they'll have.

68
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.291
BETTER DEAD THAN WED

69
00:02:57.375 --> 00:02:58.458
Mom!

70
00:02:59.625 --> 00:03:02.250
The dessert?
You said you'd bring the dessert.

71
00:03:02.458 --> 00:03:04.250
Uh. I forgot it!
I forgot it!

72
00:03:04.375 --> 00:03:06.291
Sorry. sorry. sorry.
I've been working like crazy.

73
00:03:06.416 --> 00:03:08.083
I don't get why people
get married.

74
00:03:08.166 --> 00:03:09.541
Lucky you. right?

75
00:03:10.083 --> 00:03:11.125
Where's Mom?

76
00:03:11.208 --> 00:03:13.291
Getting ready for
her new sweetheart.

77
00:03:14.166 --> 00:03:16.000
Ah. Mom. Mom...

78
00:03:17.375 --> 00:03:18.666
What's with those suitcases?

79
00:03:19.208 --> 00:03:21.375
Shit. is she moving in
with him. Ale?

80
00:03:21.541 --> 00:03:24.666
No. I wish.
No. these are mine.

81
00:03:24.875 --> 00:03:28.750
Because I told Mom
I'm moving in with you.

82
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:30.666
What? What?

83
00:03:30.833 --> 00:03:34.333
Didn't you think of telling me
before packing your suitcases?

84
00:03:34.416 --> 00:03:36.083
It's just while I get the
scholarship. I swear.

85
00:03:36.166 --> 00:03:37.583
Just for a bit.
I'm gonna get it.

86
00:03:37.708 --> 00:03:38.833
No. I don't know.

87
00:03:38.916 --> 00:03:41.375
- Why not?
- Alejandra. who's here?

88
00:03:41.458 --> 00:03:43.083
What does she mean?
Who else is coming?

89
00:03:43.583 --> 00:03:45.083
You should've told me.

90
00:03:45.208 --> 00:03:47.041
Mariana!

91
00:03:47.208 --> 00:03:48.166
Hi. Mom.

92
00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:50.958
I thought you were Epigmenio.

93
00:03:51.291 --> 00:03:52.875
Weird name. weird life.

94
00:03:53.708 --> 00:03:56.166
It's very late now.

95
00:03:56.333 --> 00:03:58.583
I'll check on the food.

96
00:04:02.083 --> 00:04:04.333
Please. don't leave me here
with her.

97
00:04:04.458 --> 00:04:06.333
Please. please.
She became super noisy.

98
00:04:06.416 --> 00:04:09.166
- I need details. Tell me.
- No. why?

99
00:04:09.291 --> 00:04:10.708
What's wrong with you?

100
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.125
- Epi. hi.
- Hey. Alejandra.

101
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.208
What's up!

102
00:04:15.208 --> 00:04:16.791
I've brought a dessert
you'll love.

103
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.041
So. how long have you
been dating?

104
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.166
A while.

105
00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:29.541
The truth is we don't go
on dates often.

106
00:04:31.375 --> 00:04:33.250
We've skipped a few steps.

107
00:04:34.333 --> 00:04:35.375
What?

108
00:04:37.083 --> 00:04:38.583
We'd rather stay home.

109
00:04:38.666 --> 00:04:42.083
You would've met Epi
if you had visited us before.

110
00:04:42.416 --> 00:04:44.291
I didn't visit you
because I can't. Mom.

111
00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:45.583
You know I'm very busy
at work.

112
00:04:45.666 --> 00:04:48.041
Besides. spring is
the busiest season.

113
00:04:48.291 --> 00:04:52.625
Of course! We met last spring.

114
00:04:59.541 --> 00:05:02.166
Elena told me
you're a wedding planner.

115
00:05:02.291 --> 00:05:04.000
Yes. I'm a wedding planner.

116
00:05:04.375 --> 00:05:05.958
It sounds quite American.
don't you think?

117
00:05:06.541 --> 00:05:09.166
When I got married. my mother
planned the wedding.

118
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.750
- Oh. so you're a divorcee?
- No. a widower.

119
00:05:11.875 --> 00:05:13.625
Oh. a widower. Poor thing.

120
00:05:13.708 --> 00:05:15.291
Maria Luisa has transcended.

121
00:05:15.375 --> 00:05:19.041
Yeah. it was a terrible.
fulminating cancer.

122
00:05:19.791 --> 00:05:21.333
I'm so sorry.

123
00:05:22.375 --> 00:05:24.625
- How old?
- Mariana.

124
00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.083
What?

125
00:05:27.333 --> 00:05:29.875
Well. she was young.
42 years old.

126
00:05:31.166 --> 00:05:32.166
A child.

127
00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:34.666
I'm so sorry.

128
00:05:34.833 --> 00:05:37.583
But I was meaning how old
are you. Epi.

129
00:05:37.666 --> 00:05:40.583
Ah. I'm 65 years old.

130
00:05:40.666 --> 00:05:41.875
He dyes his hair.

131
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.916
Don't mind her.

132
00:05:43.041 --> 00:05:45.416
Mariana and I have always done
this interrogation thing

133
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.333
since we were kids. So...

134
00:05:47.416 --> 00:05:49.250
Yeah. it became a tradition.

135
00:05:49.333 --> 00:05:51.458
So. do you have children?

136
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.750
Yes. a daughter. Leticia.
She's a neuroscientist.

137
00:05:55.833 --> 00:05:56.791
Nerds.

138
00:05:56.916 --> 00:05:58.875
Actually I wanted
to ask you something. Epi.

139
00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.666
Sorry. I have to take
this call.

140
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:02.750
Yeah. sure.

141
00:06:03.166 --> 00:06:04.375
Magali. what is it?

142
00:06:06.166 --> 00:06:07.166
No. listen. Calm her.

143
00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:09.625
It's normal for the brides to cry
a day before the wedding.

144
00:06:10.208 --> 00:06:12.708
Give her an infusion
and tell her tomorrow we'll talk.

145
00:06:13.333 --> 00:06:14.750
You know what. Magali?

146
00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:16.583
Tell her that her face
will swell if she keeps crying.

147
00:06:17.166 --> 00:06:18.166
She's interested. isn't she?

148
00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:20.041
- Okay. bye.
- Yeah. give me her number...

149
00:06:20.791 --> 00:06:22.000
Sorry.

150
00:06:23.625 --> 00:06:27.083
There's a whole science
behind my job.

151
00:06:35.208 --> 00:06:36.208
Is everything okay?

152
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.166
Yes. I'm very excited.

153
00:06:39.625 --> 00:06:41.166
Today it's the happiest day
of my life.

154
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.166
It is. right?

155
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.125
Yeah.
Yeah. yeah. of course.

156
00:06:45.208 --> 00:06:46.208
You're ready.

157
00:06:46.333 --> 00:06:47.833
And I swear I love him.

158
00:06:47.916 --> 00:06:49.125
I love him a hundred
percent.

159
00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:50.250
Okay.

160
00:06:50.375 --> 00:06:52.125
And you're telling me this

161
00:06:52.208 --> 00:06:53.750
because there's something
you haven't told me?

162
00:06:59.708 --> 00:07:02.291
No. no. no. this is just
for toasting.

163
00:07:02.375 --> 00:07:04.000
- Give it to me!
- Here.

164
00:07:05.708 --> 00:07:06.833
Can I tell you something?

165
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:10.791
They're waiting for us
downstairs.

166
00:07:10.875 --> 00:07:12.625
We're almost ready.
Thanks.

167
00:07:12.708 --> 00:07:13.625
So exciting!

168
00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.000
Wow!

169
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:18.500
Please. don't be mad.

170
00:07:21.125 --> 00:07:22.208
Here it comes.

171
00:07:22.291 --> 00:07:23.708
It's just that I can't tell
anyone.

172
00:07:23.833 --> 00:07:25.166
My bridesmaids are my
sisters-in-law.

173
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:26.666
my friends.
Fede's friends.

174
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.250
Look like you care.
and she'll spill the tea.

175
00:07:28.333 --> 00:07:29.625
Yesterday.

176
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.875
Robertito. Fede's friend.
came to my bachelorette.

177
00:07:32.041 --> 00:07:34.458
I kinda knew him.
It was something casual. casual.

178
00:07:35.208 --> 00:07:37.541
We met at the restrooms.
and...

179
00:07:38.083 --> 00:07:40.083
We just kissed a bit.

180
00:07:40.833 --> 00:07:43.208
but I don't know what to do.
Mariana. I got feelings.

181
00:07:43.625 --> 00:07:46.458
- What can I do? Should I tell Fede?
- No!

182
00:07:46.583 --> 00:07:48.041
Robertito asked me
to elope with him.

183
00:07:48.125 --> 00:07:49.541
And didn't you think
that was the best time

184
00:07:49.625 --> 00:07:50.958
to uninvite him
to the wedding?

185
00:07:51.083 --> 00:07:52.250
And what would I tell Fede?

186
00:07:52.333 --> 00:07:54.416
I kissed your best friend
and uninvited him to the wedding.

187
00:07:54.625 --> 00:07:56.208
What if he asks me
to elope with him?

188
00:07:56.291 --> 00:07:58.708
You know what. Bego?
Love is my priority.

189
00:07:59.083 --> 00:08:01.458
If you want to elope with Robertito.
I'll help you.

190
00:08:01.583 --> 00:08:02.791
I can call everything off.
just now.

191
00:08:02.875 --> 00:08:04.791
Magali. let's start
Operation Elopement.

192
00:08:04.916 --> 00:08:06.416
Let's keep Fede entertained
with some girls or something.

193
00:08:06.541 --> 00:08:08.333
- No. no. listen.
- Of course. poor guy...

194
00:08:08.541 --> 00:08:09.875
- Do I call it off?
- Yeah.

195
00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.125
Cancel Operation Elopement.

196
00:08:11.208 --> 00:08:12.916
I don't want to break
Fede's heart.

197
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:13.833
No.

198
00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:14.958
He's the best thing
that's happened to me.

199
00:08:15.041 --> 00:08:16.416
Of course.
Maybe you can tell him

200
00:08:16.541 --> 00:08:17.875
the truth in a couple
of years.

201
00:08:18.208 --> 00:08:20.208
Who hasn't kissed people
in the bathroom?

202
00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:22.041
Okay. let me tell you my story.
Sit.

203
00:08:23.458 --> 00:08:26.625
I was in your place.
Full of doubts.

204
00:08:27.208 --> 00:08:29.291
In the end. the only thing
that matters...

205
00:08:29.833 --> 00:08:34.250
are the smiles.
the moments you share.

206
00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.125
the support you give
each other.

207
00:08:38.166 --> 00:08:40.333
Relationships go
through so many stages.

208
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.666
but when you find
true love.

209
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:45.000
you have no option
but to take the leap and scream...

210
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:46.708
I love you.

211
00:08:47.208 --> 00:08:49.375
Didn't you give the ring back
to that guy?

212
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:53.750
Yeah. I mean. I don't know
why I used that example.

213
00:08:53.833 --> 00:08:55.833
It's a completely different
situation.

214
00:08:56.208 --> 00:08:59.291
The important thing is that today
your new life begins. BegoÃ±a.

215
00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.291
And everything is okay with my ex.
We're still friends.

216
00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:04.708
Actually. guess who made
the cake for today?

217
00:09:04.791 --> 00:09:07.083
When you told me
you have a restaurant.

218
00:09:07.208 --> 00:09:09.041
I thought you meant
an actual restaurant.

219
00:09:09.708 --> 00:09:11.833
What? This is an actual
restaurant. Lucy.

220
00:09:12.291 --> 00:09:15.708
Without tables.
without customers. nothing.

221
00:09:15.791 --> 00:09:18.625
I mean. that's the dream.
But it isn't a restaurant yet.

222
00:09:18.708 --> 00:09:20.291
What do you need
to open it?

223
00:09:20.375 --> 00:09:22.458
The thing is I only know
how to cook.

224
00:09:22.666 --> 00:09:25.875
Mariana was going to do
the rest.

225
00:09:26.083 --> 00:09:28.708
And now that I'm on my own.
I don't even know where to start.

226
00:09:28.791 --> 00:09:30.333
Mexico is a country of bureaucracy.

227
00:09:30.416 --> 00:09:33.541
I know.
I was trying to pay the landlord.

228
00:09:33.625 --> 00:09:35.791
and I asked him.
"why can't I pay in cash?

229
00:09:35.875 --> 00:09:37.166
I can't open
a bank account."

230
00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.666
and he told me he knows
some lawyers. but they're expensive.

231
00:09:39.791 --> 00:09:41.916
So I have to pay
to be allowed to pay.

232
00:09:42.041 --> 00:09:43.000
It's ridiculous.

233
00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:45.375
I mean. being a resident
in Mexico is a hassle.

234
00:09:46.791 --> 00:09:48.250
What's wrong?

235
00:09:49.833 --> 00:09:50.791
Listen.

236
00:09:50.916 --> 00:09:52.958
Mariana and I are friends. okay?

237
00:09:53.375 --> 00:09:55.666
We're business partners.

238
00:09:56.166 --> 00:09:57.250
She's a customer.

239
00:09:57.333 --> 00:09:59.625
A customer who broke my heart.
but a customer still.

240
00:09:59.708 --> 00:10:02.583
We have a healthy relationship.

241
00:10:02.666 --> 00:10:05.083
an adult relationship from which
we've moved on.

242
00:10:05.166 --> 00:10:06.666
Completely moved on.

243
00:10:20.083 --> 00:10:21.500
Help me. Help me. please?

244
00:10:21.583 --> 00:10:22.916
Let's take it
because it's getting late.

245
00:10:24.875 --> 00:10:26.416
It is what it is.

246
00:10:37.416 --> 00:10:39.000
It's the worst day of my life.

247
00:10:39.125 --> 00:10:40.166
I know.
I know. Robertito.

248
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:43.083
but look. you have to think
of your future. your new life.

249
00:10:43.208 --> 00:10:44.708
- It'll be okay.
- No. no. no!

250
00:10:44.791 --> 00:10:46.291
It'll be okay.
Trust me.

251
00:10:47.041 --> 00:10:48.708
Ready. my love?

252
00:10:50.166 --> 00:10:51.166
I am.

253
00:10:52.875 --> 00:10:54.625
I don't Know. Ready!

254
00:10:55.208 --> 00:10:57.125
I'm over. I'm over.
I'm over it.

255
00:10:59.666 --> 00:11:01.708
My poor buddy.

256
00:11:03.208 --> 00:11:06.833
He's... heartbroken.

257
00:11:09.708 --> 00:11:13.000
It's just business.
and we're professional. Right?

258
00:11:13.083 --> 00:11:14.166
It doesn't matter.

259
00:11:14.333 --> 00:11:16.541
If anything happens.
tell her I'm your girlfriend.

260
00:11:18.125 --> 00:11:19.083
Okay.

261
00:11:20.625 --> 00:11:22.791
Okay. dear Luis.
This way.

262
00:11:22.916 --> 00:11:24.250
- Hi.
- Hi.

263
00:11:25.625 --> 00:11:27.750
You need a few more drinks.

264
00:11:28.041 --> 00:11:29.250
Hey. here!

265
00:11:29.416 --> 00:11:31.541
- Thank you very much.
- I'm an idiot.

266
00:11:31.625 --> 00:11:33.250
There you go. This will
make you feel better.

267
00:11:33.333 --> 00:11:35.125
Luisito. thank you.
as always.

268
00:11:35.208 --> 00:11:36.208
Nice to see you. Magali.

269
00:11:36.333 --> 00:11:37.333
I'm gonna say
hi to my friend Mariana.

270
00:11:37.416 --> 00:11:38.625
My friend!

271
00:11:39.625 --> 00:11:40.708
His friend.

272
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Luis!

273
00:11:42.208 --> 00:11:43.583
Here. drink it.

274
00:11:44.541 --> 00:11:46.375
Yeah. that's right.

275
00:11:47.541 --> 00:11:48.625
Feeling better?

276
00:11:50.708 --> 00:11:51.833
Done.

277
00:11:53.583 --> 00:11:56.166
Mariana. do you copy me?
Shit might hit the fan.

278
00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.208
Shit might hit the fan.

279
00:11:58.416 --> 00:12:00.291
Not literally.
It all looks clean.

280
00:12:06.291 --> 00:12:07.583
No!

281
00:12:07.875 --> 00:12:09.208
Ah. Robertito.

282
00:12:11.416 --> 00:12:12.583
Hey. hey.

283
00:12:13.791 --> 00:12:15.208
Well. I have to work.

284
00:12:15.291 --> 00:12:16.500
But I'll be right back.
I'll be back.

285
00:12:16.583 --> 00:12:18.625
They'll make you some...
Two more here. please.

286
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:20.333
I'll be back.
I'll be back. okay?

287
00:12:20.458 --> 00:12:23.583
Hey. you make
the most of these weddings.

288
00:12:24.041 --> 00:12:25.916
Ah. Robertito?

289
00:12:26.041 --> 00:12:28.791
- Yeah.
- Yeah. how are you?

290
00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:32.708
You look... What's the word?
Different.

291
00:12:33.666 --> 00:12:35.458
That's how people look
when they feel good.

292
00:12:35.541 --> 00:12:36.791
Luis.

293
00:12:37.083 --> 00:12:38.166
Happy.

294
00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:40.541
Enjoying everything.
So happy. you know?

295
00:12:40.625 --> 00:12:41.666
And you?

296
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:43.708
I'm good. Very. very good.

297
00:12:43.791 --> 00:12:46.666
I've just finished furnishing
the apartment.

298
00:12:47.041 --> 00:12:48.583
and the purple carpet.
do you remember?

299
00:12:48.666 --> 00:12:50.041
The one you disliked?

300
00:12:50.166 --> 00:12:52.291
Well. now I like it.
You were right.

301
00:12:52.375 --> 00:12:54.916
Well. I'm glad somebody
is enjoying it.

302
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.625
- I've got to work.
- Yeah.

303
00:12:56.791 --> 00:12:58.208
- What do you mean?
- Mariana!

304
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:02.333
Yeah. I enjoy it.
with...

305
00:13:07.875 --> 00:13:08.916
Are you coming with her?

306
00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.916
Yeah. she's Lucia. my roomie.

307
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.125
my buddy.

308
00:13:13.208 --> 00:13:15.000
my confidante. my comrade.

309
00:13:15.083 --> 00:13:16.333
Just friends?

310
00:13:16.541 --> 00:13:18.166
Yeah. I got it. I got it.

311
00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:20.000
I've been going from date
after date. you have no idea.

312
00:13:20.083 --> 00:13:21.416
Making up for the lost time.

313
00:13:21.541 --> 00:13:22.791
You have no idea.

314
00:13:22.875 --> 00:13:24.333
Well. I'm leaving.

315
00:13:24.416 --> 00:13:26.625
No. no. you got me. you know?

316
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:27.791
I got you?

317
00:13:27.916 --> 00:13:29.750
What can I say?
Why should I lie?

318
00:13:29.833 --> 00:13:31.958
I mean. it's not like
I'm gonna hurt you.

319
00:13:32.833 --> 00:13:33.875
Lucia.

320
00:13:34.416 --> 00:13:37.541
I'm coming with her.
but not as friends. but...

321
00:13:37.708 --> 00:13:39.625
like two lovebirds.

322
00:13:41.333 --> 00:13:43.041
What? Why are you laughing?

323
00:13:44.083 --> 00:13:47.041
Of course. I've never heard
you saying you're a lovebird.

324
00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.708
With somebody else. Luis.
Somebody else.

325
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:51.958
Listen...

326
00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:55.750
Move! Damn.

327
00:13:56.083 --> 00:13:57.041
You...

328
00:13:57.375 --> 00:13:58.291
Bro...

329
00:13:58.375 --> 00:13:59.833
I never told you
she was a summer fling.

330
00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.666
and now that she's back
from Colombia... Old flames...

331
00:14:02.916 --> 00:14:05.750
- Colombian?
- Yeah.

332
00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.125
No. you didn't tell me.

333
00:14:07.208 --> 00:14:09.416
A few nice months.
Truly amazing!

334
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.750
Yeah. yeah. I got it.
I just found it weird

335
00:14:11.833 --> 00:14:13.666
that you jumped into a new
relationship so quickly.

336
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:16.458
Because. I mean.
you were always the slow type.

337
00:14:16.666 --> 00:14:18.708
- Awful. awful.
- Awful.

338
00:14:18.875 --> 00:14:20.125
But you know what I liked
about her?

339
00:14:20.208 --> 00:14:22.458
That I didn't have to flirt
with her

340
00:14:22.541 --> 00:14:24.125
because she knows what
she wants.

341
00:14:24.208 --> 00:14:26.291
She's not like it's a game...

342
00:14:26.375 --> 00:14:28.250
I'm so glad. Well. I have to...

343
00:14:28.333 --> 00:14:31.375
She's amazing. I love her.

344
00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:33.250
Right.

345
00:14:33.333 --> 00:14:34.416
I'll marry her.

346
00:14:38.208 --> 00:14:39.208
What?

347
00:14:40.458 --> 00:14:42.333
I'm marrying.
I'm getting married. Mariana.

348
00:14:42.458 --> 00:14:43.833
- I'm getting married.
- Ah.

349
00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.916
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. yeah.

350
00:14:51.166 --> 00:14:53.333
Well. congratulations.

351
00:14:54.166 --> 00:14:55.750
When is the wedding?

352
00:14:56.208 --> 00:14:58.208
Soon. very soon.

353
00:14:58.416 --> 00:15:00.458
I mean. not now.
But very soon.

354
00:15:00.583 --> 00:15:02.333
I mean. in the end
it's just a party.

355
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.125
I'm sure she needs the papers
to be a resident. right?

356
00:15:07.041 --> 00:15:08.583
What?
Don't be mean.

357
00:15:08.666 --> 00:15:09.916
People do fall in love.

358
00:15:10.166 --> 00:15:12.375
It's good love. divine love.

359
00:15:13.166 --> 00:15:15.916
Good love.
Like in all marriages.

360
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.125
Of course.

361
00:15:17.208 --> 00:15:19.041
Well. I'm happy for you.

362
00:15:19.833 --> 00:15:22.375
Yeah. I don't know if I should
believe you.

363
00:15:22.458 --> 00:15:25.125
but those eyes
and that sheepish smile.

364
00:15:25.208 --> 00:15:28.291
- What sheepish smile?
- To the newlyweds!

365
00:15:28.375 --> 00:15:31.041
I mean it. I'm truly happy
for you and for her.

366
00:15:31.208 --> 00:15:32.708
I know you were dying
to get married.

367
00:15:32.791 --> 00:15:34.458
In fact.
I can plan your wedding.

368
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:36.708
What?

369
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:40.041
I wish you all the best.

370
00:15:42.125 --> 00:15:43.458
Brother.

371
00:15:43.583 --> 00:15:45.666
I'm the best.
and nobody knows you like I do.

372
00:15:45.875 --> 00:15:47.416
- That's good.
- Fool!

373
00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.625
Okay. sure. perfect.

374
00:15:50.708 --> 00:15:52.375
- We're adults. aren't we?
- Yes.

375
00:15:52.458 --> 00:15:54.500
I knew you were dying
to get married.

376
00:15:54.583 --> 00:15:56.875
no matter what.
no matter the person.

377
00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.208
With the love of my life.

378
00:15:58.291 --> 00:15:59.875
With the love of your life. yes.

379
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.791
Well. see you on Monday
at the office.

380
00:16:01.875 --> 00:16:03.750
- I love Mondays.
- Perfect.

381
00:16:03.875 --> 00:16:06.500
See you on Monday.
Great!

382
00:16:06.583 --> 00:16:07.625
Cool!

383
00:16:12.416 --> 00:16:13.625
Hi.

384
00:16:13.708 --> 00:16:15.083
What's up?

385
00:16:15.166 --> 00:16:19.750
Well. we're here.
in the name of love.

386
00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:22.708
This one. Mariana... Mariana!

387
00:16:23.416 --> 00:16:24.875
- Three cheers for love!
- Yeah. yeah.

388
00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:28.625
Yeah. to the love I feel for you.
Fede. my brother.

389
00:16:28.708 --> 00:16:30.666
And I love you. gorgeous!

390
00:16:31.166 --> 00:16:33.083
But. especially...

391
00:16:34.041 --> 00:16:35.416
What I truly want to say...

392
00:16:41.166 --> 00:16:43.333
especially.
I wanna say I love her!

393
00:16:43.791 --> 00:16:47.333
I love her. Bego.
my Bego!

394
00:16:48.208 --> 00:16:49.375
- He's drunk.
- Yes.

395
00:16:49.458 --> 00:16:50.708
Wasn't he your DJ?

396
00:16:50.791 --> 00:16:51.958
Shut up. shut up!

397
00:16:52.375 --> 00:16:53.708
Do you want me to beat
the shit out of him?

398
00:16:53.791 --> 00:16:54.791
- What happened?
- I don't know.

399
00:16:54.916 --> 00:16:56.875
Why don't you tell everyone

400
00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:58.666
- what we did last night
- What?

401
00:16:58.791 --> 00:16:59.958
in the bar's bathroom?

402
00:17:00.083 --> 00:17:01.125
What did you do yesterday?

403
00:17:01.208 --> 00:17:05.000
Everyone knocked on the door
and I'd say. "No. it's occupied."

404
00:17:05.291 --> 00:17:07.958
I went to the bathroom.

405
00:17:08.041 --> 00:17:10.250
You're my soulmate...

406
00:17:11.833 --> 00:17:14.000
You're my only love.

407
00:17:14.625 --> 00:17:16.541
- Bego. what the hell?
- Yes.

408
00:17:16.625 --> 00:17:17.458
Bego!

409
00:17:17.666 --> 00:17:18.625
Come.

410
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.125
What the hell. Bego!

411
00:17:20.208 --> 00:17:21.291
No. no!

412
00:17:22.083 --> 00:17:23.083
No. no!

413
00:17:24.166 --> 00:17:25.333
Help him!

414
00:17:26.083 --> 00:17:27.583
No. no. no!

415
00:17:34.333 --> 00:17:35.625
Damn you. Roberto!

416
00:17:36.875 --> 00:17:39.208
Why are you doing this to me?
Shit!

417
00:17:39.625 --> 00:17:40.875
Careful. careful!

418
00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:43.166
Oh. my God!

419
00:17:45.208 --> 00:17:47.958
- Come.
- Yes.

420
00:18:24.791 --> 00:18:26.291
Did they even pay?

421
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:31.875
There's nothing we can do.

422
00:18:33.166 --> 00:18:34.166
To the next one.

423
00:18:35.166 --> 00:18:36.166
What goes next?

424
00:18:37.208 --> 00:18:38.333
Mauricio and Renata.

425
00:18:39.791 --> 00:18:41.083
Carlos and Sofia.

426
00:18:42.708 --> 00:18:43.750
and Luis.

427
00:18:46.583 --> 00:18:48.250
We'll plan Luis's wedding.

428
00:18:49.875 --> 00:18:50.916
Really?

429
00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:55.083
- Girl.
- Oh. I know.

430
00:19:07.625 --> 00:19:08.708
Mariana!

431
00:19:08.916 --> 00:19:09.958
Mariana!

432
00:19:10.208 --> 00:19:11.208
Mariana!

433
00:19:12.625 --> 00:19:14.083
What did you do?

434
00:19:14.166 --> 00:19:15.250
Magali called me.

435
00:19:15.333 --> 00:19:16.916
What did you want me to do?

436
00:19:17.333 --> 00:19:18.791
Congratulations on your wedding.

437
00:19:18.875 --> 00:19:20.583
Send me your gift list.

438
00:19:21.458 --> 00:19:22.958
Why are you doing this?

439
00:19:24.708 --> 00:19:27.000
Because I'm either a fool
or a genius.

440
00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:28.791
Mariana.
you gave him the ring back.

441
00:19:28.875 --> 00:19:30.125
You told him you didn't want
to get married.

442
00:19:30.208 --> 00:19:31.833
and now you're doing this?

443
00:19:31.916 --> 00:19:33.166
It sounds like self-sabotage.
don't you think?

444
00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:34.625
No. not at all.

445
00:19:34.708 --> 00:19:37.333
Are you sure you want to plan
Luis's wedding?

446
00:19:37.708 --> 00:19:38.833
I'm not sure.

447
00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:41.125
but I'm intrigued.

448
00:19:41.833 --> 00:19:43.291
You're a psycho.

449
00:19:43.458 --> 00:19:45.958
- Hey!
- Hey. you scare me!

450
00:19:50.833 --> 00:19:53.000
Take a chill pill. man.

451
00:19:53.208 --> 00:19:56.333
You did the cleverest shit

452
00:19:56.416 --> 00:19:58.000
you could've done in your life.

453
00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:00.166
No. man.
I'll call her. tell her the truth

454
00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:02.125
and end with this bullshit. now.

455
00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:04.250
What the hell is truth. man?

456
00:20:04.875 --> 00:20:07.083
It's impossible to know
the truth.

457
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.541
especially in this post-truth world.
am I right?

458
00:20:10.625 --> 00:20:12.791
I just wanted to tease her
a bit.

459
00:20:13.916 --> 00:20:15.708
Have you forgotten what she did
to you?

460
00:20:35.625 --> 00:20:37.583
I just wanted to annoy her
a bit. man.

461
00:20:37.791 --> 00:20:40.750
My king. today you have to win.

462
00:20:41.125 --> 00:20:43.458
If you do this. she'll definitely
ask for forgiveness.

463
00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:45.666
Then. what?

464
00:20:46.166 --> 00:20:47.666
Do I go on with this?
Should I marry Lucia?

465
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:48.791
Should we have kids?

466
00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:51.125
No. you don't have to go
that far.

467
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.916
Mariana will yield before that.

468
00:20:54.166 --> 00:20:57.666
And if you get married to her.
what's the problem?

469
00:20:58.166 --> 00:20:59.208
You can hire me.

470
00:20:59.291 --> 00:21:02.000
Bring DJ Dion to your wedding.
A super party.

471
00:21:02.666 --> 00:21:04.125
And if you have a kid?

472
00:21:04.208 --> 00:21:05.750
I'll be their godfather.

473
00:21:05.833 --> 00:21:07.291
Is there a problem?

474
00:21:07.458 --> 00:21:09.083
Lucia will refuse. man.

475
00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:11.000
A good seller knows that.

476
00:21:11.208 --> 00:21:14.458
Either you persuade with facts
or through blackmail.

477
00:21:14.541 --> 00:21:16.458
and you know her better
than I do.

478
00:21:17.166 --> 00:21:19.083
I'm a romance genius. am I not?

479
00:21:19.166 --> 00:21:20.208
You're...

480
00:21:20.583 --> 00:21:22.625
No. no. no. dude.

481
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:25.208
- I won't do it. period.
- Please. Lucy.

482
00:21:25.291 --> 00:21:26.500
Listen. don't do it for me.

483
00:21:26.583 --> 00:21:28.000
It's for you.
It's the best for you.

484
00:21:29.208 --> 00:21:31.208
Listen.
I'm not that desperate. Luis.

485
00:21:31.291 --> 00:21:32.541
Hey.

486
00:21:32.708 --> 00:21:35.958
Listen. she made me look like
a fool when she gave the ring back.

487
00:21:36.083 --> 00:21:37.500
I don't wanna
look like a fool twice

488
00:21:37.583 --> 00:21:39.000
if she finds out
everything was a lie.

489
00:21:39.125 --> 00:21:40.958
I don't know. It's not my fault.
Fire her.

490
00:21:41.041 --> 00:21:44.375
Tell her I don't want her
in my wedding. No.

491
00:21:44.541 --> 00:21:46.166
This woman is relentless.

492
00:21:46.291 --> 00:21:48.833
Besides. it's a bit your fault.

493
00:21:49.208 --> 00:21:53.000
You said if anything happened.
I could say we were dating.

494
00:21:53.125 --> 00:21:56.416
- Accept your responsibility.
- No. no. I can't fake a wedding.

495
00:21:56.541 --> 00:21:57.958
- That's ridiculous.
- That's the point.

496
00:21:58.041 --> 00:21:59.500
We won't fake anything.

497
00:21:59.583 --> 00:22:00.958
We get married.

498
00:22:01.041 --> 00:22:02.916
a little party. a little fun.

499
00:22:03.375 --> 00:22:06.500
Yeah. and think of your papers.

500
00:22:06.583 --> 00:22:09.083
It's your dream.
having your own apartment.

501
00:22:09.166 --> 00:22:10.125
can you imagine it?

502
00:22:10.208 --> 00:22:12.625
Your own bank account.
getting a job.

503
00:22:13.166 --> 00:22:14.833
A citizen of the world.

504
00:22:16.041 --> 00:22:17.958
And then we'll have kids
or what?

505
00:22:18.083 --> 00:22:19.875
No. We can annul
the marriage in two years.

506
00:22:19.958 --> 00:22:22.166
But that won't be an issue
because you'll be living

507
00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:24.333
- the "Mexican dream."
- Mexican dream.

508
00:22:24.416 --> 00:22:26.166
Otherwise. people will think
badly of you.

509
00:22:27.291 --> 00:22:29.666
- Exactly.
- It's for your own good.

510
00:22:30.541 --> 00:22:35.166
Lu. people like divorcees more
than happy singletons.

511
00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:36.333
That's right...

512
00:22:36.416 --> 00:22:38.375
Don't ask me why.
I didn't make the rules.

513
00:22:38.458 --> 00:22:39.958
No. no. Luis.

514
00:22:40.041 --> 00:22:42.333
No. I don't want to do it.
I can't.

515
00:22:42.416 --> 00:22:46.666
Imagine you're my plus one
in any other wedding.

516
00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:51.250
but this wedding means the residence
and freedom for you. Lu.

517
00:22:51.333 --> 00:22:53.000
When was the last time
you paid the rent?

518
00:22:54.125 --> 00:22:56.666
There you go. see?
Let's screw this system

519
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:59.083
that divides us with
its stupid borders. Enough!

520
00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:02.125
Are you making all this up
to get rid of me?

521
00:23:02.208 --> 00:23:04.458
No. no. no.
I mean. freedom.

522
00:23:04.541 --> 00:23:09.000
I mean that. citizenship.
individuality. a passport.

523
00:23:09.291 --> 00:23:11.750
Okay. Lu. what should we do
if we see that

524
00:23:11.833 --> 00:23:14.208
they're beating someone
on the street?

525
00:23:14.416 --> 00:23:16.125
Do we just leave them?

526
00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:18.875
Do we tell them
they're exaggerating?

527
00:23:18.958 --> 00:23:21.791
No. we help them.

528
00:23:23.583 --> 00:23:27.125
Oh. Dioni. I can't.

529
00:23:29.125 --> 00:23:30.125
Ah!

530
00:23:30.208 --> 00:23:33.041
Lu. let me be your visa husband.

531
00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:39.166
For how long will this be?

532
00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:40.583
We'll talk about it.

533
00:23:40.708 --> 00:23:42.208
Tell me until I watch the video.

534
00:23:46.291 --> 00:23:47.250
Oh.

535
00:23:47.416 --> 00:23:48.708
Call him now.

536
00:23:49.833 --> 00:23:51.250
Something's wrong.
This is very weird.

537
00:23:51.375 --> 00:23:52.541
Well. if it's weird.

538
00:23:52.666 --> 00:23:54.166
call him and call it off.
It's none of your business.

539
00:23:55.166 --> 00:23:56.250
Yeah. right?

540
00:23:56.333 --> 00:23:57.375
Well.

541
00:24:04.625 --> 00:24:07.583
No. we'll carry on with this.
okay?

542
00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:09.125
Why?

543
00:24:09.208 --> 00:24:11.291
You've called off worse things.
Your wedding. for instance.

544
00:24:11.375 --> 00:24:12.500
Why not this?

545
00:24:12.583 --> 00:24:14.208
Magali. take care of the weddings
we have scheduled

546
00:24:14.291 --> 00:24:15.833
and don't take others for now.

547
00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:19.375
This will be my masterpiece.
and it'll take a lot of my time.

548
00:24:25.125 --> 00:24:27.916
Usually she's not this excited
about her job.

549
00:24:28.166 --> 00:24:30.125
- It's guilt.
- It's bullshit.

550
00:24:30.333 --> 00:24:31.458
It's bullshit.

551
00:24:31.833 --> 00:24:34.625
Say my favorite things.
Come on.

552
00:24:34.791 --> 00:24:38.041
Your Japanese knife
and making cocktails for me.

553
00:24:38.125 --> 00:24:40.791
He hates shrimp and has
a lovely snore.

554
00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:45.041
She'll ask for my favorite position.
What is it?

555
00:24:47.958 --> 00:24:49.208
Doggy.

556
00:24:51.166 --> 00:24:53.750
No. spooning.

557
00:24:54.708 --> 00:24:57.791
Ah. you've changed?

558
00:24:58.041 --> 00:25:01.125
But you know what?
Yeah. tell her doggy style.

559
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:02.500
She can say doggy style?

560
00:25:02.583 --> 00:25:04.375
Yeah. she'll hate it.

561
00:25:04.583 --> 00:25:06.208
She'll hate it!

562
00:25:06.291 --> 00:25:08.375
And the most important
thing. Lucia.

563
00:25:09.166 --> 00:25:11.833
you were my first one.
okay?

564
00:25:11.958 --> 00:25:14.750
And yeah. she was my first one.

565
00:25:15.541 --> 00:25:17.583
and it's lovely how destiny
will make her...

566
00:25:17.666 --> 00:25:19.125
my last one.

567
00:25:20.416 --> 00:25:23.250
- Very. very romantic.
- Yeah.

568
00:25:26.625 --> 00:25:27.833
Recycled ring.

569
00:25:28.083 --> 00:25:31.291
Okay. let's do this.
We'll celebrate your wedding.

570
00:25:31.375 --> 00:25:32.916
I mean. your love.

571
00:25:33.166 --> 00:25:34.916
- Isn't there anything else?
- No.

572
00:25:36.125 --> 00:25:37.458
We said no lies.

573
00:25:37.875 --> 00:25:39.208
This is all fake.

574
00:25:39.916 --> 00:25:41.083
Do you think I'm an idiot?

575
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:44.458
Answer me!

576
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:46.000
Do you think I'm an idiot?

577
00:25:53.041 --> 00:25:54.583
Do we have to answer that?

578
00:25:54.666 --> 00:25:55.958
Are you okay?

579
00:25:56.833 --> 00:25:59.500
It's a test we do
with all our clients.

580
00:25:59.583 --> 00:26:01.291
but you've passed it.

581
00:26:01.375 --> 00:26:04.208
So. tell me. what's the thing you
like the most about Luis?

582
00:26:05.625 --> 00:26:07.041
What can I say. Mary?

583
00:26:07.125 --> 00:26:10.208
- Mariana.
- Damn. they're so many. Mary.

584
00:26:10.291 --> 00:26:13.916
Well. I love his Japanese knife.

585
00:26:14.125 --> 00:26:17.208
- Ah. the...
- How he makes cocktails...

586
00:26:18.708 --> 00:26:20.625
The lovely things he tells me.

587
00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:27.125
I even like his snores. Mary.
Can you believe it?

588
00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.625
Well. what about
his favorite position? I know it.

589
00:26:29.708 --> 00:26:30.750
Doggy.

590
00:26:32.166 --> 00:26:33.583
Awesome!

591
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.416
- Of course.
- Yeah.

592
00:26:36.958 --> 00:26:38.416
- Yes.
- Yes.

593
00:26:39.708 --> 00:26:42.083
Do you know what I like the most
about her?

594
00:26:42.208 --> 00:26:44.750
She's a confident woman.

595
00:26:44.875 --> 00:26:45.708
Ah!

596
00:26:45.875 --> 00:26:49.125
Well. normal.
but she's brave enough

597
00:26:49.208 --> 00:26:52.000
to face her trauma

598
00:26:52.083 --> 00:26:54.875
- and overcome it. Right. my love?
- Yeah. yeah.

599
00:26:54.958 --> 00:26:56.500
She's been honest
from the very beginning.

600
00:26:56.583 --> 00:26:57.833
She'd never hurt me.

601
00:26:57.916 --> 00:26:59.375
We'll. lucky you.

602
00:26:59.916 --> 00:27:04.000
Yeah. and the most important thing.
She keeps her promises.

603
00:27:04.541 --> 00:27:06.625
- That's quite clear.
- Yeah.

604
00:27:06.833 --> 00:27:11.083
Well. Mary. you know
Poochi loves dancing.

605
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:15.583
so we want something that
feels very much like us. you know?

606
00:27:15.666 --> 00:27:19.708
Like... #LuiCia.

607
00:27:20.291 --> 00:27:21.625
Ugh. kill yourselves.

608
00:27:21.708 --> 00:27:24.541
Kill me or LuiCia. I don't care.

609
00:27:24.666 --> 00:27:26.375
How long have you been together?

610
00:27:26.708 --> 00:27:28.166
Ah...

611
00:27:28.416 --> 00:27:31.375
Well. answering that is like
looking back to the past.

612
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:34.583
and the truth is that LuiCia
looks into the future.

613
00:27:37.166 --> 00:27:38.166
Okay.

614
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:41.333
And when do you want
your wedding to be?

615
00:27:41.416 --> 00:27:43.291
Well. in about a month and a half?

616
00:27:43.375 --> 00:27:45.750
Yeah. maximum.
If we extend it too much.

617
00:27:46.833 --> 00:27:49.666
Don't tell me you're pregnant.

618
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:52.625
- No. no.
- Not yet.

619
00:27:52.708 --> 00:27:56.083
Not yet. because we know
in a year or two

620
00:27:56.166 --> 00:27:57.416
anything can happen.

621
00:27:57.541 --> 00:27:58.541
Yeah.

622
00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:03.666
I mean. we have this urge
to celebrate love.

623
00:28:04.166 --> 00:28:05.625
- Yes.
- Yes.

624
00:28:05.791 --> 00:28:08.125
Yeah. I suppose you also
have this urge

625
00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:11.666
to get your papers for
the Mexican residence. right?

626
00:28:12.458 --> 00:28:15.416
No. no Mary. not really.

627
00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:18.875
The point is we'd like to
get married. Mariana.

628
00:28:18.958 --> 00:28:21.708
It's not so complicated.
It's just a party.

629
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.541
Yeah. just a party.

630
00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.791
The godfather.
Who's gonna be the godfather?

631
00:28:27.875 --> 00:28:29.625
Let me guess. Dionisio?

632
00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:34.208
- Of course.
- Right.

633
00:28:42.875 --> 00:28:44.500
My. my.

634
00:28:44.583 --> 00:28:45.708
My. my.

635
00:28:47.375 --> 00:28:49.000
- Hey.
- Hi.

636
00:28:49.166 --> 00:28:51.666
- Dioni.
- The son of Zeus?

637
00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:56.333
Are you. Ale?
The ex-girlfriend's sister?

638
00:28:56.416 --> 00:28:57.791
And you're the godfather now?

639
00:28:57.875 --> 00:28:58.916
The godfather...

640
00:28:59.458 --> 00:29:03.375
and D-D-D-DJ. Dioni.

641
00:29:03.458 --> 00:29:05.083
the life of the party.

642
00:29:05.166 --> 00:29:07.291
Livening up the best events.
always.

643
00:29:07.375 --> 00:29:08.541
you know.

644
00:29:09.166 --> 00:29:12.458
I'll be there. at the front row.
witnessing love.

645
00:29:13.083 --> 00:29:14.208
Really?

646
00:29:14.291 --> 00:29:18.250
Why so many papers?
So much yada yada.

647
00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.541
Flesh feels so nice.

648
00:29:21.583 --> 00:29:23.500
It's so easy to just...

649
00:29:23.916 --> 00:29:25.125
Look at each other.

650
00:29:25.833 --> 00:29:28.708
feel their touch.
muffle their fear.

651
00:29:29.791 --> 00:29:31.125
It's funny.

652
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:33.083
I've always thought the same.

653
00:29:35.208 --> 00:29:38.583
You just have to sign the contract.
and that's all.

654
00:29:39.333 --> 00:29:41.250
- I'll leave it here.
- Oh. Poochi!

655
00:29:42.833 --> 00:29:44.083
Here you go.

656
00:29:45.166 --> 00:29:46.916
Congratulations. LuiCia.

657
00:29:47.833 --> 00:29:49.166
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

658
00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:51.833
#LuiCia. you forgot it.

659
00:29:54.708 --> 00:29:56.208
Awesome!

660
00:29:56.416 --> 00:29:58.958
- Did you see her face?
- Yeah.

661
00:29:59.166 --> 00:30:01.791
- She was pissed. but I'm scared.
- Yeah.

662
00:30:01.875 --> 00:30:04.500
"Oh. I won't ask the position
because I know it."

663
00:30:05.041 --> 00:30:07.750
As if you told that
to all your customers.

664
00:30:09.208 --> 00:30:11.833
Hey. Luis. Do you think she's
suspicious?

665
00:30:11.916 --> 00:30:13.000
- No!
- No?

666
00:30:13.083 --> 00:30:14.250
No. not at all.

667
00:30:14.333 --> 00:30:16.208
Besides. what's the worst
that could happen?

668
00:30:16.291 --> 00:30:17.791
I'm helping you.

669
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.875
I'll annoy her just a bit.

670
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.458
throw a big party
with my buddies.

671
00:30:21.541 --> 00:30:24.916
hire DJ Dioni.
and we're all happy. okay?

672
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.291
LuiCia. victorious.

673
00:30:27.375 --> 00:30:29.625
Luis. why the fuck are you
doing this?

674
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:31.916
Why don't you sit with her?
Talk with her. and that's it.

675
00:30:32.041 --> 00:30:34.916
- No. that'd be the easy road.
- Exactly.

676
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.416
No. I want her to feel
the frustration

677
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:39.208
of losing someone.

678
00:30:39.791 --> 00:30:41.458
Oh. drama queen.

679
00:30:41.541 --> 00:30:44.916
You wanna shatter her heart
into thousands of pieces.

680
00:30:45.041 --> 00:30:46.541
If it can be more. the better.

681
00:30:46.625 --> 00:30:47.500
That's shitty!

682
00:30:47.583 --> 00:30:49.500
- Why?
- Because it is.

683
00:30:49.583 --> 00:30:53.041
- Do you want another beer. Luis?
- Yeah. yeah.

684
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.833
What about your girlfriend?

685
00:30:55.916 --> 00:30:57.666
Oh. no. sweetie. no.

686
00:30:58.291 --> 00:31:01.416
I've come with him.
but I'm not with him.

687
00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.041
- Ah.
- Ah. yes. but no.

688
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:07.166
Especially. no.

689
00:31:10.833 --> 00:31:12.666
What was that?
Why did you do it?

690
00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:14.750
What? Look. look.

691
00:31:15.208 --> 00:31:16.833
Booze.

692
00:31:16.916 --> 00:31:19.625
- Hey. dumbass. Where were you?
- Hey!

693
00:31:20.083 --> 00:31:21.250
It's a secret.

694
00:31:36.125 --> 00:31:38.958
Don't tell anyone.
nobody. not even your pillow.

695
00:31:42.166 --> 00:31:43.708
You're my love secret.

696
00:31:44.125 --> 00:31:46.250
- No love secrets. okay?
- Okay.

697
00:31:47.375 --> 00:31:49.458
Hey. cheers.

698
00:31:49.541 --> 00:31:51.250
Tell me.
How was it?

699
00:31:51.333 --> 00:31:54.916
- She called her Mary.
- She hates to be called Mary.

700
00:31:55.791 --> 00:31:57.250
Order something. Lu.

701
00:31:58.166 --> 00:31:59.541
That was my beer.

702
00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:01.041
Oh. sorry. Lucy. Here.

703
00:32:01.125 --> 00:32:02.875
No. Luis. I want mine.

704
00:32:17.708 --> 00:32:18.708
Hello?

705
00:32:19.333 --> 00:32:20.333
Berta.

706
00:32:20.416 --> 00:32:22.041
Oh. sorry. am I interrupting?

707
00:32:22.125 --> 00:32:24.583
Oh. I'm glad you came.

708
00:32:26.166 --> 00:32:27.291
- Look.
- No!

709
00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:30.000
Oh. you didn't have to.
but I'm glad you did it.

710
00:32:30.208 --> 00:32:31.916
It's our favorite tiramisu.

711
00:32:32.041 --> 00:32:33.208
Oh. it looks delicious!

712
00:32:41.041 --> 00:32:42.291
How are you doing?

713
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:45.333
I'm good. Working a lot.
but I'm good.

714
00:32:45.416 --> 00:32:46.791
- And you?
- Same.

715
00:32:46.875 --> 00:32:48.791
Who would've thought it?
Luis is getting married.

716
00:32:50.958 --> 00:32:51.916
He is...

717
00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:00.875
What?

718
00:33:03.541 --> 00:33:05.500
Didn't you think of telling us
before?

719
00:33:05.666 --> 00:33:08.416
I had to hear somewhere else
that you're getting married?

720
00:33:09.666 --> 00:33:11.083
Listen. listen. listen.

721
00:33:11.166 --> 00:33:13.166
Calm down. please.

722
00:33:13.291 --> 00:33:17.000
My mom. she's the traitor's BFF.
You can't do that. right. Dad?

723
00:33:17.125 --> 00:33:18.708
Berta and I are friends.

724
00:33:18.833 --> 00:33:20.666
It has nothing to do with Luis.

725
00:33:21.041 --> 00:33:23.875
You never visit your mother.
but you visit your ex's!

726
00:33:23.958 --> 00:33:24.875
No. no. no.

727
00:33:24.958 --> 00:33:26.333
The thing is Berta
is a lovely person.

728
00:33:27.166 --> 00:33:30.166
It's so weird that she didn't know
anything about the wedding.

729
00:33:30.791 --> 00:33:32.875
And you told her.
didn't you?

730
00:33:33.041 --> 00:33:35.000
I didn't know
she didn't know.

731
00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:37.166
There's something wrong.
and you don't believe me.

732
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:38.791
There's nothing wrong here.

733
00:33:39.208 --> 00:33:40.916
I was going to tell you.
Why wouldn't I?

734
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.833
I had prepared a surprise.

735
00:33:42.916 --> 00:33:46.833
but I wasn't expecting you to
go and give her my tiramisu. Mom.

736
00:33:47.083 --> 00:33:49.500
Yeah. she brought me some.
I'll save some for you next time.

737
00:33:49.583 --> 00:33:50.958
Yeah. save me some.
But you know what?

738
00:33:51.083 --> 00:33:54.333
Save face. Mariana.
if you still have some left.

739
00:33:54.416 --> 00:33:58.166
It's a rule.
If her son was inside you.

740
00:33:58.291 --> 00:34:01.208
you can't be friends.
unless he passed away.

741
00:34:03.833 --> 00:34:05.125
Do you want me to kill him?

742
00:34:05.208 --> 00:34:08.791
No one's killing anyone. dear.

743
00:34:10.208 --> 00:34:13.041
Okay.
I won't meet with her anymore.

744
00:34:13.916 --> 00:34:15.791
Can you tell us about
your wedding?

745
00:34:15.875 --> 00:34:16.791
Sure!

746
00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:19.958
I'm marrying Lucia.

747
00:34:20.875 --> 00:34:23.000
Do you remember Lucia.
the Colombian girl who came once?

748
00:34:23.083 --> 00:34:25.208
You remember her. don't you?

749
00:34:25.291 --> 00:34:27.166
- Lu... Lucy?
- Lucy.

750
00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:28.875
But wasn't she...?

751
00:34:28.958 --> 00:34:30.166
Lucy?

752
00:34:30.375 --> 00:34:32.791
Why not her?
Mom. it happened.

753
00:34:32.875 --> 00:34:34.583
She came back. and...

754
00:34:34.666 --> 00:34:36.666
we met...

755
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.166
- No. we. no.
- You fell in love?

756
00:34:39.625 --> 00:34:40.708
Exactly.

757
00:34:40.791 --> 00:34:43.250
You love each other
like we do.

758
00:34:45.166 --> 00:34:49.291
How can you love each other
after so many years?

759
00:34:50.208 --> 00:34:52.750
Well... We just do it.

760
00:34:56.166 --> 00:34:57.166
Dear team.

761
00:34:57.333 --> 00:35:00.250
we're planning the most important
wedding we've ever made.

762
00:35:00.375 --> 00:35:01.833
The ex-boyfriend's wedding.

763
00:35:02.291 --> 00:35:04.125
For Luis. someone you all know.

764
00:35:04.208 --> 00:35:06.166
Obviously I know him
better than anyone.

765
00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:09.083
Well. maybe his girlfriend
or his mom know him more.

766
00:35:09.208 --> 00:35:11.708
But I'm in the top five
of people who know him the most.

767
00:35:12.208 --> 00:35:14.833
I want something original.
unseen.

768
00:35:14.916 --> 00:35:16.000
Ideas.

769
00:35:16.083 --> 00:35:18.625
I have an idea.
but I have many questions.

770
00:35:19.208 --> 00:35:21.541
Does the dress have to be
long and white?

771
00:35:21.625 --> 00:35:22.916
Well. does it have to be
a dress?

772
00:35:23.833 --> 00:35:25.041
That's the spirit.

773
00:35:25.166 --> 00:35:28.166
Photos. do we have
photo ideas? Flowers?

774
00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:31.000
I'm thinking of using marigolds
for decoration.

775
00:35:31.208 --> 00:35:33.750
And maybe we can throw soil
instead of rice

776
00:35:33.833 --> 00:35:36.083
to bury the past.

777
00:35:36.708 --> 00:35:40.875
I love it. I'm feeling this awesome
vibe. Am I the only one?

778
00:35:40.958 --> 00:35:42.458
Well. I'll go and fetch
the bouquet.

779
00:35:42.541 --> 00:35:44.583
- Unleash your imagination.
- Come on!

780
00:35:44.958 --> 00:35:46.083
What if...?

781
00:35:46.208 --> 00:35:47.791
Don Antonio it's lovely.

782
00:35:47.875 --> 00:35:51.458
But we're gonna need something
less white.

783
00:35:51.541 --> 00:35:53.625
Maybe less flowers
and more thorns.

784
00:35:53.708 --> 00:35:54.958
Something less aerodynamic.

785
00:35:55.125 --> 00:35:56.083
With personality.

786
00:35:56.166 --> 00:35:57.083
Thanks.

787
00:36:01.166 --> 00:36:02.958
For whom is that bouquet?

788
00:36:03.333 --> 00:36:04.416
For a friend.

789
00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:05.916
What friend?

790
00:36:07.291 --> 00:36:09.500
For which friend is that bouquet?

791
00:36:10.166 --> 00:36:12.083
- Ale told you. didn't she?
- Mariana.

792
00:36:12.208 --> 00:36:14.041
Mom. this is serious business.

793
00:36:14.208 --> 00:36:16.166
Luis is my client.
It's all cool.

794
00:36:16.375 --> 00:36:19.416
Well. what do you think
about Epi?

795
00:36:20.166 --> 00:36:21.166
He looks okay. good.

796
00:36:21.333 --> 00:36:24.041
I mean. I barely know him.
but I'm glad you're happy.

797
00:36:24.208 --> 00:36:26.833
Ah. well. you'll be happier
because we'll go dancing.

798
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.125
- Sounds good. Have fun.
- No. I mean all of us.

799
00:36:29.208 --> 00:36:31.250
Epi wants you to come with us

800
00:36:31.375 --> 00:36:33.041
because he couldn't
get to meet you properly.

801
00:36:33.166 --> 00:36:34.250
He wants to get to know you
more.

802
00:36:34.375 --> 00:36:35.333
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

803
00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:37.833
Mom. I'm planning a wedding.
I can't. I'm very busy.

804
00:36:37.916 --> 00:36:41.458
Listen. Mariana.
We're in a market.

805
00:36:41.541 --> 00:36:44.000
I'm helping you choose
a bouquet...

806
00:36:44.166 --> 00:36:46.250
- Mariana. you owe me one.
- Mom. you're...

807
00:36:46.875 --> 00:36:50.250
Perfect. Don Antonio.
I love it.

808
00:36:50.333 --> 00:36:52.000
Maybe I can put
these ones here...

809
00:36:52.083 --> 00:36:53.625
Perfect.
just what I wanted.

810
00:37:06.166 --> 00:37:07.625
Did you call me God?

811
00:37:08.208 --> 00:37:09.583
What?

812
00:37:09.666 --> 00:37:11.875
You said. "Oh. God!"

813
00:37:11.958 --> 00:37:13.791
- Right?
- I didn't.

814
00:37:13.958 --> 00:37:17.166
- Of course not.
- Of course you did.

815
00:37:17.291 --> 00:37:18.666
I said your name.

816
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:20.916
But I get you.
It was good.

817
00:37:21.208 --> 00:37:23.916
No one has ever told me
something so sweet.

818
00:37:27.833 --> 00:37:30.750
- I'm leaving.
- What if I do this?

819
00:37:42.083 --> 00:37:46.333
Well. if you excuse me.
I'll be right back.

820
00:37:51.958 --> 00:37:54.041
So what do you do. Epi?

821
00:37:54.125 --> 00:37:55.750
Are we playing now?

822
00:37:56.833 --> 00:37:58.541
I'm retired.

823
00:37:58.625 --> 00:38:03.083
but now I manage a shelter
for dogs with disabilities.

824
00:38:03.208 --> 00:38:04.041
Wow!

825
00:38:04.125 --> 00:38:06.166
Do you only receive dogs
with disabilities?

826
00:38:06.291 --> 00:38:08.208
What about the other ones?

827
00:38:08.291 --> 00:38:10.208
I mean. they're so many.

828
00:38:11.708 --> 00:38:13.125
What are your quirks?

829
00:38:13.208 --> 00:38:14.625
Your vices?

830
00:38:15.875 --> 00:38:18.541
I don't know.
I don't do many things.

831
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:20.791
Yeah. you look boring.

832
00:38:20.958 --> 00:38:22.833
I run 6 miles
every day.

833
00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:25.000
Any other hobby?

834
00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:26.666
The usual.

835
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:29.583
cooking. reading.

836
00:38:30.166 --> 00:38:32.583
sometimes I smoke a cigar.

837
00:38:32.791 --> 00:38:35.083
- This motherfucker is a killer.
- Awesome.

838
00:38:35.166 --> 00:38:37.833
We have the information
that we need.

839
00:38:37.916 --> 00:38:39.291
Epi. thank you so much.

840
00:38:39.666 --> 00:38:41.125
What do you think
about reggaeton?

841
00:38:41.208 --> 00:38:44.166
Oh. those musicians
are perverts.

842
00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:46.625
I knew it. a right-wing bigot.

843
00:38:46.708 --> 00:38:48.166
Well. we shouldn't be judgmental.
shouldn't we?

844
00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:51.166
No. of course not.
I'm not a killjoy.

845
00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:53.541
If I need reggaeton.

846
00:38:53.708 --> 00:38:54.791
I'm into it.

847
00:38:56.583 --> 00:38:59.000
So. is the interrogation over?

848
00:38:59.083 --> 00:39:01.458
Yeah. Mom. Epi wanted to
dance with you.

849
00:39:01.541 --> 00:39:03.208
- Oh. great!
- Shall we?

850
00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:09.791
Shall we?

851
00:39:11.875 --> 00:39:13.666
Oh. you fucked it up. Ale.

852
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:15.208
I had cornered him.

853
00:39:15.625 --> 00:39:18.000
Cornered him where. Mariana?

854
00:39:18.125 --> 00:39:19.791
- Didn't we...?
- Ah!

855
00:39:19.916 --> 00:39:22.250
Oh. Mom.
That's so embarrassing!

856
00:39:22.583 --> 00:39:24.125
He's a good dancer.
don't you think?

857
00:39:25.416 --> 00:39:26.833
Yeah.

858
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:31.250
Oh. they're so cute!

859
00:39:31.958 --> 00:39:34.583
LuiCia will be like that
during their honeymoon.

860
00:39:35.041 --> 00:39:37.041
Only if they can go through
the wedding.

861
00:39:38.541 --> 00:39:40.000
If they can go through
the wedding.

862
00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:46.583
This is my favorite part:
choosing the type of wedding.

863
00:39:46.666 --> 00:39:49.833
We want you to make
all decisions together.

864
00:39:50.333 --> 00:39:52.375
- Are you ready?
- Super ready.

865
00:39:52.583 --> 00:39:53.583
More than ready.

866
00:39:53.666 --> 00:39:56.125
So. we have to choose
the style of the wedding.

867
00:39:56.208 --> 00:39:57.583
Knowing Luis's taste.

868
00:39:57.833 --> 00:40:00.000
I thought he'd like something
like...

869
00:40:00.208 --> 00:40:01.333
fantasy themed.

870
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:16.375
Hey. Mariana.
don't you think that's a bit silly?

871
00:40:16.458 --> 00:40:17.458
Wouldn't it be better
something... more...

872
00:40:17.541 --> 00:40:19.291
Right. it's a bit old-fashioned.
right?

873
00:40:19.375 --> 00:40:22.125
Maybe something trendy.

874
00:40:32.166 --> 00:40:34.041
- Right?
- I know. I know.

875
00:40:34.166 --> 00:40:38.958
Something local. more rustic.
to honor Lucia's hometown.

876
00:40:47.916 --> 00:40:51.125
Oh. no. Mary. It's not a town.
It's Bogota. the capital.

877
00:40:52.416 --> 00:40:53.750
Let me find other options.

878
00:40:53.833 --> 00:40:55.708
No. Mariana.
thanks for your suggestions.

879
00:40:55.791 --> 00:40:57.416
Let me tell you the wedding
we want.

880
00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:58.333
Yes.

881
00:40:58.416 --> 00:41:01.208
A simple wedding. beers. music.

882
00:41:01.291 --> 00:41:02.625
- Yeah. yeah. I remember. Luis.
- Fairy lights.

883
00:41:02.791 --> 00:41:06.375
- In your restaurant. right?
- Noted. So...

884
00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:09.291
Poochi.

885
00:41:10.166 --> 00:41:16.083
Flowers are fundamental
in a love story

886
00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:20.375
because they represent
the couple's fertility.

887
00:41:20.458 --> 00:41:24.041
That's why it's important
for you to touch them.

888
00:41:24.541 --> 00:41:26.208
smell them.

889
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.791
and especially. talk to them.

890
00:41:29.375 --> 00:41:30.541
Talk to them!

891
00:41:34.208 --> 00:41:35.291
Talk to them!

892
00:41:39.458 --> 00:41:41.291
Oh. damn.
Okay.

893
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:45.833
Hello?

894
00:41:46.625 --> 00:41:47.541
Flower?

895
00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:52.708
I'm getting married. flower.

896
00:41:52.791 --> 00:41:54.416
So I'd like to invite you to
my wedding.

897
00:41:54.666 --> 00:41:55.916
Would you like to come?

898
00:41:56.333 --> 00:41:59.916
What?
Oh. sure. sure. Of course.

899
00:42:00.041 --> 00:42:01.666
They want to talk to you. Lu.

900
00:42:01.791 --> 00:42:04.166
- Me?
- Yeah. they said so.

901
00:42:04.375 --> 00:42:05.250
Ah.

902
00:42:06.166 --> 00:42:07.500
Dear flower.

903
00:42:08.166 --> 00:42:10.250
of course you can come
to our wedding.

904
00:42:10.916 --> 00:42:14.125
Besides. you can bring
your partner!

905
00:42:17.833 --> 00:42:20.291
- You can feel the...
- Yeah. you can.

906
00:42:23.583 --> 00:42:28.333
So now that my buddy Luis
is tying the knot.

907
00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:31.541
let's delight him with
a beautiful song.

908
00:42:31.666 --> 00:42:33.958
Yes. sir!
Rah!

909
00:42:41.875 --> 00:42:43.791
The New Sound Orchestra.

910
00:43:20.666 --> 00:43:23.833
You'll never find
Someone like me

911
00:43:24.208 --> 00:43:27.166
No one who loves you like me
Until I die

912
00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:30.166
Nobody will love you like me

913
00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:31.833
No one to bring
The stars and sky for you

914
00:43:31.916 --> 00:43:34.291
With beams of passion

915
00:43:34.375 --> 00:43:38.416
That's it. you can fall in love
But not even a thousand kisses

916
00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:42.291
Will put off the eternal fire
Burning in your heart

917
00:43:42.416 --> 00:43:46.583
You said you found love

918
00:43:46.708 --> 00:43:48.500
You lie. you lie. you lie

919
00:43:48.625 --> 00:43:51.291
Because I'll always be
Part of your life

920
00:43:51.375 --> 00:43:54.875
I'm so sorry
For your next victim

921
00:43:55.166 --> 00:43:56.416
Everything you and I did

922
00:43:56.500 --> 00:44:00.708
Life itself transformed you
Woman. don't try to erase it

923
00:44:00.833 --> 00:44:03.958
You say he treats you well
That he has conquered you

924
00:44:04.166 --> 00:44:07.166
Your friends have said new love
Takes your mind off the old one

925
00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:09.041
But let's be serious.
Let's be clear

926
00:44:09.166 --> 00:44:12.041
Nobody has reached
The depths of your soul

927
00:44:12.208 --> 00:44:13.416
Closed case

928
00:44:13.541 --> 00:44:17.000
You said you found love

929
00:44:17.208 --> 00:44:19.166
But you lie. you lie. you lie

930
00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:22.250
And you even say you regret
Our time together

931
00:44:22.333 --> 00:44:25.916
I can see miles away
That's not true

932
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.208
And now when you talk about me

933
00:44:27.291 --> 00:44:30.750
You only pay lip service
To your words

934
00:44:30.833 --> 00:44:33.666
And upload photos pretending

935
00:44:33.791 --> 00:44:37.125
You hold him in one and you
dance with him in the other

936
00:44:37.208 --> 00:44:38.625
You dance with your friends

937
00:44:38.708 --> 00:44:41.416
But I haven't seen anywhere
The after party

938
00:44:41.583 --> 00:44:43.333
These might look good together.
don't you think?

939
00:44:52.166 --> 00:44:53.166
Bride?

940
00:44:56.166 --> 00:44:58.083
- Let's go. I have to go.
- Yes. I know.

941
00:44:58.166 --> 00:45:00.250
You only need your love dance.

942
00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:03.250
Oh. no. we can do that
some other time. Poochi.

943
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.291
Bad mood is usual.

944
00:45:05.375 --> 00:45:07.083
It happens all the time.
I see it every day.

945
00:45:07.166 --> 00:45:08.708
No. the thing is we don't have
a song yet.

946
00:45:08.791 --> 00:45:11.708
What? "The Funeral March."
"Bad Decisions."

947
00:45:11.791 --> 00:45:13.625
"Not in Love."

948
00:45:14.291 --> 00:45:15.125
Poochi.

949
00:45:15.208 --> 00:45:17.250
Listen. dumbass.
you said it'd be just an hour.

950
00:45:17.375 --> 00:45:18.625
I can't spend all my day
with you.

951
00:45:18.791 --> 00:45:20.208
Talk to Ramona.
Tell her you're with me.

952
00:45:20.291 --> 00:45:21.125
She'll understand.

953
00:45:21.208 --> 00:45:23.000
No. no. no.
I want to be punctual.

954
00:45:23.125 --> 00:45:24.833
I want to be cool.
and I like her.

955
00:45:24.916 --> 00:45:26.041
Stop fucking around!

956
00:45:26.166 --> 00:45:28.666
Yeah. let's wait for her to
find out you're engaged. Poochi.

957
00:45:29.708 --> 00:45:31.291
Fuck you. Poochi!

958
00:45:32.208 --> 00:45:33.375
I'm joking.

959
00:45:40.625 --> 00:45:42.666
- Hey!
- Hey!

960
00:45:47.208 --> 00:45:48.583
Okay. I can't.

961
00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:49.875
That's so hot.

962
00:45:50.041 --> 00:45:51.166
Shut up!

963
00:45:51.333 --> 00:45:53.000
You're an idiot.

964
00:46:06.833 --> 00:46:07.791
What?

965
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.875
Am I still "Plumber" in
your phone?

966
00:46:11.166 --> 00:46:13.750
No. Of course not.
why are you saying that?

967
00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:18.750
I'm sure your sister wants you
to go back home.

968
00:46:19.208 --> 00:46:21.625
No. Mariana is always
super busy

969
00:46:21.708 --> 00:46:25.041
with a guy.
or with many. in an orgy.

970
00:46:25.208 --> 00:46:26.625
I'm so happy for her.

971
00:46:26.708 --> 00:46:29.583
Because Luis and Lucia
spend all day...

972
00:46:29.666 --> 00:46:30.916
Lots of noise.

973
00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:35.541
What is it?

974
00:46:37.958 --> 00:46:39.083
I was given a scholarship.

975
00:46:40.208 --> 00:46:41.291
What scholarship?

976
00:46:41.375 --> 00:46:43.208
I applied for a two-year
Master's

977
00:46:43.375 --> 00:46:45.083
in Vancouver.
and they've offered it to me.

978
00:46:45.166 --> 00:46:47.208
It's a super.
super cool university.

979
00:46:48.458 --> 00:46:50.333
That's good. Congratulations.

980
00:46:51.708 --> 00:46:52.625
That's good.

981
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:56.250
So. when are you leaving?

982
00:46:57.916 --> 00:46:59.416
Soon. very soon.

983
00:47:02.208 --> 00:47:04.375
Well. let's celebrate. then.

984
00:47:08.333 --> 00:47:09.333
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

985
00:47:16.375 --> 00:47:19.333
So. can you keep another
secret for me. sir?

986
00:47:20.291 --> 00:47:21.875
So many secrets with you.

987
00:47:24.791 --> 00:47:26.083
My lips are sealed.

988
00:47:26.208 --> 00:47:27.791
Are they? How sealed?

989
00:47:49.666 --> 00:47:51.291
So. do you get good tips?

990
00:47:52.833 --> 00:47:54.250
Now that you mention it.

991
00:47:54.416 --> 00:47:56.500
the more they throw up.
the better the tips.

992
00:47:57.916 --> 00:48:00.791
And they kinda grow fond of you

993
00:48:00.916 --> 00:48:02.791
when you look after them
while they're drunk

994
00:48:03.166 --> 00:48:05.333
and help them with their
heartbreaks.

995
00:48:07.541 --> 00:48:10.666
so they always come back.

996
00:48:22.666 --> 00:48:24.208
Thanks for waiting for me.

997
00:48:25.208 --> 00:48:27.000
And miss out on your smile?

998
00:48:28.208 --> 00:48:31.458
Hey. but this residence thing
is very tricky.

999
00:48:31.833 --> 00:48:33.000
You can say you're very Mexican

1000
00:48:33.125 --> 00:48:34.458
without knowing
the national anthem.

1001
00:48:35.166 --> 00:48:37.375
Actually. I wanted to tell you
my method

1002
00:48:37.458 --> 00:48:39.208
to get the residence.

1003
00:48:45.875 --> 00:48:48.125
They're vegan.
They taste like shit.

1004
00:48:49.833 --> 00:48:52.041
Some vegan cakes can be
amazing.

1005
00:48:52.125 --> 00:48:54.000
I don't even know why
you're doing this.

1006
00:49:05.166 --> 00:49:06.875
- Hey. Dioni.
- Hey.

1007
00:49:06.958 --> 00:49:08.541
- Where's Luis?
- There.

1008
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.500
Hey. Ale.

1009
00:49:10.583 --> 00:49:12.291
Hey. Luis's friend.

1010
00:49:12.458 --> 00:49:13.875
Mary. why are you here?

1011
00:49:13.958 --> 00:49:16.041
No. no. no. no.
the tasting is in two hours.

1012
00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:18.583
- We said 12.
- No. we said 2 p.m.

1013
00:49:19.166 --> 00:49:20.333
We said 12. Luis.

1014
00:49:20.416 --> 00:49:23.000
No. I wrote 14.
14 p.m.

1015
00:49:23.083 --> 00:49:25.125
Okay. since you never read
what I text.

1016
00:49:25.333 --> 00:49:26.833
- I wrote down 14.
- It's okay.

1017
00:49:27.583 --> 00:49:29.458
Hey. we haven't met.

1018
00:49:29.541 --> 00:49:30.875
I'm Mariana.
nice to meet you.

1019
00:49:30.958 --> 00:49:32.250
Hi. I'm Ramona.

1020
00:49:32.375 --> 00:49:33.375
I'm...

1021
00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:36.041
Lucia's best friend.

1022
00:49:36.208 --> 00:49:37.166
Ah!

1023
00:49:39.166 --> 00:49:40.666
What's with those desserts?

1024
00:49:43.666 --> 00:49:46.083
What? Luis?
You didn't tell your fiancÃ©e?

1025
00:49:46.416 --> 00:49:48.250
No. it's just that...
It was a surprise. right?

1026
00:49:48.333 --> 00:49:49.916
- It was a surprise.
- Surprise.

1027
00:49:51.291 --> 00:49:52.541
Surprise!

1028
00:49:54.166 --> 00:49:55.958
Okay. let's do this.

1029
00:49:56.041 --> 00:49:57.083
- May I help?
- Leave it to me.

1030
00:49:57.166 --> 00:49:58.458
- Just tell me where to go.
- Here.

1031
00:50:00.958 --> 00:50:03.291
So. what do you think?
It's very trendy.

1032
00:50:03.375 --> 00:50:05.208
Vegan. slash. bittersweet.
slash.

1033
00:50:05.291 --> 00:50:07.625
traditional. Mexican.

1034
00:50:09.166 --> 00:50:11.208
Slash. are there other options?

1035
00:50:11.375 --> 00:50:13.041
We could go for something
more classic.

1036
00:50:13.166 --> 00:50:14.291
But these ones are awesome

1037
00:50:14.375 --> 00:50:15.875
because they use
the water that's left

1038
00:50:15.958 --> 00:50:18.375
after cooking the chickpeas.
instead of egg.

1039
00:50:20.208 --> 00:50:21.708
It sounds super healthy.

1040
00:50:22.708 --> 00:50:25.291
PLUMBER: YOU DENIED ME
LIKE PETER TO OUR LORD

1041
00:50:28.083 --> 00:50:29.708
It has loads of sugar.

1042
00:50:33.666 --> 00:50:35.125
Can you pass me
the spoon?

1043
00:50:35.875 --> 00:50:37.750
Sure. Lucia's friend.

1044
00:50:43.208 --> 00:50:46.625
ALE: LUCIA'S FRIEND?

1045
00:50:54.583 --> 00:50:56.958
LUIS: YOU LOVE TIRAMISU.

1046
00:50:58.166 --> 00:51:00.083
Could we try my tiramisu?

1047
00:51:00.166 --> 00:51:01.291
It's an option.

1048
00:51:02.166 --> 00:51:03.291
Oh. is it? Yeah.

1049
00:51:03.416 --> 00:51:05.416
I love tiramisu. Mary.

1050
00:51:06.541 --> 00:51:09.333
You also want tiramisu?
Okay.

1051
00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:14.500
Okay.

1052
00:51:20.291 --> 00:51:23.041
MARIANA: MY CAKE!
HE'S A PSYCHOPATH!

1053
00:51:24.625 --> 00:51:26.166
You know what?

1054
00:51:26.291 --> 00:51:27.916
Can we invite your mom?

1055
00:51:28.041 --> 00:51:31.958
I mean. you know Elena and I
have always been like family.

1056
00:51:32.041 --> 00:51:34.500
- You don't mind. my love?
- No. no. Poochi.

1057
00:51:34.583 --> 00:51:37.750
If it matters to you.
it matters to me.

1058
00:51:39.166 --> 00:51:41.666
Besides. Mary is like
a little sister to you now.

1059
00:51:41.791 --> 00:51:43.958
Mariana.
Sure. we can invite her.

1060
00:51:44.041 --> 00:51:45.750
- No problem.
- I'm glad.

1061
00:51:45.833 --> 00:51:46.916
Well...

1062
00:51:48.958 --> 00:51:51.500
So. should we try the tiramisu?

1063
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000
Oh.
you had it already prepared!

1064
00:51:54.833 --> 00:51:56.541
Let's see.

1065
00:52:02.083 --> 00:52:03.333
It's so good!

1066
00:52:04.208 --> 00:52:06.041
It has like an essence...

1067
00:52:06.291 --> 00:52:07.958
is it orange?

1068
00:52:08.541 --> 00:52:10.125
Right. exactly.

1069
00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:12.750
The thing is I was making
a tiramisu once

1070
00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:15.041
and Mariana came.
do you remember?

1071
00:52:15.250 --> 00:52:18.291
She dropped all
the orange essence

1072
00:52:18.458 --> 00:52:20.791
and it tasted amazing.

1073
00:52:20.875 --> 00:52:21.791
It's funny. don't you think?

1074
00:52:21.875 --> 00:52:24.041
Sometimes you screw
something up

1075
00:52:24.208 --> 00:52:26.000
and things turn out
to be amazing.

1076
00:52:26.208 --> 00:52:29.500
I mean. it was a cake.
It's not "The" tiramisu.

1077
00:52:31.083 --> 00:52:32.083
Yeah.

1078
00:52:32.625 --> 00:52:35.375
DIONI: GET REVENGE
WITH A KISS.

1079
00:52:36.958 --> 00:52:38.375
Okay. then.

1080
00:52:49.208 --> 00:52:50.125
Well.

1081
00:52:50.625 --> 00:52:52.458
so?

1082
00:52:53.458 --> 00:52:55.500
The godfather goes for the tiramisu.

1083
00:52:56.625 --> 00:52:59.083
Yeah. I love tiramisu.

1084
00:52:59.166 --> 00:53:00.875
I think tiramisu
is the best choice

1085
00:53:02.166 --> 00:53:03.833
because Luis always makes
it good.

1086
00:53:06.708 --> 00:53:08.791
The bride votes for tiramisu.

1087
00:53:09.250 --> 00:53:10.750
Say no more.

1088
00:53:12.166 --> 00:53:14.666
We've made a decision.
Tiramisu it is.

1089
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.208
- Sure.
- Yes.

1090
00:53:18.166 --> 00:53:20.333
Do you do this
for all the weddings?

1091
00:53:21.208 --> 00:53:23.750
Yeah. brides love it.

1092
00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:26.375
I see.

1093
00:53:27.250 --> 00:53:29.291
And do the grooms come?

1094
00:53:29.458 --> 00:53:31.708
I mean. Poochi
would've loved to come.

1095
00:53:31.875 --> 00:53:34.000
I know. but I'd like to get
to know you more.

1096
00:53:34.083 --> 00:53:38.875
Luis is my friend.
and I care for him.

1097
00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:41.083
And he's kind of obsessed
with weddings

1098
00:53:41.208 --> 00:53:42.416
so I'm concerned.

1099
00:54:02.958 --> 00:54:04.333
I don't know. Your face
tells me

1100
00:54:04.416 --> 00:54:06.541
you don't like weddings
so much. Mary.

1101
00:54:07.708 --> 00:54:10.041
You know what?
I used to love them.

1102
00:54:10.125 --> 00:54:12.333
but you eventually find out
people get married

1103
00:54:12.416 --> 00:54:14.041
to pay less for the rent.

1104
00:54:14.125 --> 00:54:15.583
because their moms forced them.

1105
00:54:15.791 --> 00:54:17.833
because there's a kid coming.

1106
00:54:18.208 --> 00:54:20.375
and then I saw myself.
every day.

1107
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.916
trying to persuade these people
to love each other.

1108
00:54:25.625 --> 00:54:28.708
Of course. that happens for those
who don't love each other.

1109
00:54:29.458 --> 00:54:31.000
unlike you and Luis.

1110
00:54:31.875 --> 00:54:33.375
But they always say they love
each other.

1111
00:54:33.666 --> 00:54:35.291
so how do you know
it's serious?

1112
00:54:35.375 --> 00:54:36.583
That's the point.

1113
00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:37.791
You don't know.

1114
00:54:39.208 --> 00:54:41.125
That's a terrible point.

1115
00:54:43.208 --> 00:54:44.500
Only your dress is missing.

1116
00:54:44.625 --> 00:54:45.583
Let's go!

1117
00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:52.666
No!
Hey. hold on. wait!

1118
00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:54.500
- No. this is too tight.
- It'll fit you!

1119
00:54:54.583 --> 00:54:55.541
No. Mary.

1120
00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:57.333
I was thinking
of something simpler.

1121
00:54:57.416 --> 00:54:59.208
No. but it was original.
It was good.

1122
00:54:59.291 --> 00:55:00.833
Quique. did you use
the measurements I sent you?

1123
00:55:00.916 --> 00:55:01.750
Yeah. of course.

1124
00:55:01.833 --> 00:55:03.750
Look. this is the most important
day of your life.

1125
00:55:03.875 --> 00:55:05.208
You must look divine.

1126
00:55:05.291 --> 00:55:07.166
Yeah. but if it doesn't fit.
that's it.

1127
00:55:07.250 --> 00:55:08.666
I mean. a skeleton isn't divine.

1128
00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:11.791
What can we do?

1129
00:55:11.875 --> 00:55:15.083
I don't want you to work out
to death to get in the dress.

1130
00:55:19.166 --> 00:55:20.416
Do you have your pills?

1131
00:55:21.875 --> 00:55:22.958
Of course.

1132
00:55:25.541 --> 00:55:27.041
Look. take one of these.

1133
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.208
Maybe you're just
retaining water.

1134
00:55:30.291 --> 00:55:32.041
or it's the normal tummy
after eating.

1135
00:55:32.125 --> 00:55:33.791
- Of course.
- What is this?

1136
00:55:33.875 --> 00:55:35.458
Spirulina and cactus.

1137
00:55:35.625 --> 00:55:38.791
The worst thing that could happen
is over-stimulating your digestion.

1138
00:55:38.875 --> 00:55:41.541
Then. we get rid of the tummy
and the dress will fit you.

1139
00:55:42.250 --> 00:55:44.416
Let's take those pins.

1140
00:55:49.833 --> 00:55:51.125
I love taking the brides here.

1141
00:55:51.291 --> 00:55:52.625
This is where I get to know
them better.

1142
00:55:52.708 --> 00:55:54.125
If they order burritos.
they're boring.

1143
00:55:54.208 --> 00:55:55.208
Beef tacos.

1144
00:55:55.916 --> 00:55:57.208
they're daddy's girls.

1145
00:55:57.291 --> 00:56:00.166
And if they hate quesadillas.
they're mad.

1146
00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:03.083
Don't you want some?
Some juice?

1147
00:56:03.166 --> 00:56:05.041
- No. Mary. thanks.
- No. no.

1148
00:56:05.125 --> 00:56:06.916
I'll have another one. please.

1149
00:56:07.166 --> 00:56:08.166
Thanks.

1150
00:56:09.166 --> 00:56:11.791
Well. yeah. A papaya
and mango drink. please.

1151
00:56:11.875 --> 00:56:13.083
And...

1152
00:56:13.208 --> 00:56:16.500
Pork brains quesadilla. please.

1153
00:56:36.875 --> 00:56:38.000
Thanks.

1154
00:56:38.083 --> 00:56:38.916
Thanks.

1155
00:56:40.416 --> 00:56:41.791
Won't you take some for Luis?

1156
00:56:42.708 --> 00:56:45.375
They're his favorite.
you know that?

1157
00:56:47.208 --> 00:56:48.458
Yeah.

1158
00:56:48.791 --> 00:56:52.041
Mariana. Luis isn't obsessed
with weddings.

1159
00:56:52.125 --> 00:56:54.000
Luis wanted to get married.
but he wanted to marry you.

1160
00:56:54.083 --> 00:56:55.875
Because he's never loved anyone
the way he loved you.

1161
00:56:55.958 --> 00:56:58.375
And he wanted to celebrate it.
That's what weddings are for.

1162
00:56:59.166 --> 00:57:00.166
Did he say that?

1163
00:57:01.458 --> 00:57:03.125
Things weren't like that.

1164
00:57:05.166 --> 00:57:07.375
Well. I feel he really likes me.

1165
00:57:07.458 --> 00:57:09.000
But what you had was amazing.

1166
00:57:10.166 --> 00:57:12.458
It was amazing.

1167
00:57:13.416 --> 00:57:14.625
until he ruined it.

1168
00:57:21.583 --> 00:57:23.416
Surprise!

1169
00:57:26.208 --> 00:57:28.375
My love. my mom wanted...

1170
00:57:28.833 --> 00:57:31.000
Surprise. Lucia. my friend.

1171
00:57:31.083 --> 00:57:32.166
Ah.

1172
00:57:32.291 --> 00:57:34.750
Hi. Luis's family.

1173
00:57:34.833 --> 00:57:38.833
Last time we met.
it was... similar.

1174
00:57:41.291 --> 00:57:43.083
Very similar.

1175
00:57:43.166 --> 00:57:48.166
I give you this machete
as a symbol of Luis's strength

1176
00:57:48.250 --> 00:57:49.958
throughout his marriage.

1177
00:57:50.416 --> 00:57:54.166
Use to open a path
to your children.

1178
00:57:54.375 --> 00:57:55.458
Don't be in a hurry. okay?

1179
00:57:56.625 --> 00:57:57.708
Although.

1180
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.500
a Luis Jr. or a Lucy
wouldn't be so bad.

1181
00:58:02.666 --> 00:58:03.833
Thanks.

1182
00:58:05.166 --> 00:58:08.458
I give you this mortar
so you can make Luis

1183
00:58:08.541 --> 00:58:12.791
some spicy salsas
and keep the spice in love

1184
00:58:13.208 --> 00:58:15.916
and have as many children
as God wills.

1185
00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:17.583
Oh. thanks.

1186
00:58:18.708 --> 00:58:19.625
Are you okay?

1187
00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:21.583
Yeah. yeah.

1188
00:58:21.916 --> 00:58:24.291
I give you these tools

1189
00:58:24.375 --> 00:58:27.375
to fix all the problems
in your relationship.

1190
00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:30.666
and this hammer
to destroy the hate.

1191
00:58:30.833 --> 00:58:32.458
and these nippers...

1192
00:58:33.041 --> 00:58:36.250
Chook-chook. To keep love together.

1193
00:58:38.208 --> 00:58:39.416
Thanks. auntie.

1194
00:58:40.083 --> 00:58:41.166
Thank you.

1195
00:58:42.208 --> 00:58:43.750
Can you call me auntie?

1196
00:58:46.208 --> 00:58:48.125
- I'm not feeling well.
- Lucy?

1197
00:58:48.208 --> 00:58:49.416
- Ah!
- I'm going with you.

1198
00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:50.583
I think she's nervous.

1199
00:58:50.666 --> 00:58:52.833
- Yeah. sure.
- Yeah. sure. It's normal.

1200
00:58:55.166 --> 00:58:56.250
Can I help you with...?

1201
00:58:57.333 --> 00:59:00.208
- Careful! That's my bag!
- Bring toilet paper and a bucket!

1202
00:59:00.875 --> 00:59:02.666
- Do you need it. girls?
- Lucy!

1203
00:59:04.083 --> 00:59:05.083
Are you okay?

1204
00:59:20.166 --> 00:59:21.208
Mom!

1205
00:59:29.166 --> 00:59:30.250
What is it. Mom?

1206
00:59:37.208 --> 00:59:38.291
I'm getting married.

1207
00:59:39.833 --> 00:59:41.875
- What?
- Wow!

1208
00:59:42.208 --> 00:59:44.416
- I'm getting married.
- Okay. you too.

1209
00:59:44.541 --> 00:59:48.916
I don't know when.
but it's a promise.

1210
00:59:49.416 --> 00:59:51.083
I asked Epi.

1211
00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:54.458
I'm glad. Mom.
Congratulations.

1212
00:59:54.583 --> 00:59:57.000
Epi is super cool.
and we're happy for you.

1213
00:59:57.083 --> 00:59:58.250
Right. Mariana?

1214
00:59:59.208 --> 01:00:00.750
Mom. listen.

1215
01:00:00.833 --> 01:00:03.916
Can we do an activity?
I just need to understand.

1216
01:00:05.166 --> 01:00:08.166
From 1 to 100.
how much do you love Epi?

1217
01:00:09.958 --> 01:00:12.375
Sweetie. sometimes a 100.
sometimes 1.

1218
01:00:13.166 --> 01:00:15.333
- Love is a journey.
- Yes.

1219
01:00:15.416 --> 01:00:19.208
You decide who will be
your passenger.

1220
01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:23.958
- Epi is the one.
- Sure. the one.

1221
01:00:24.083 --> 01:00:27.250
Like the guy who kicked you out
of your apartment?

1222
01:00:27.333 --> 01:00:28.750
- Girl...
- Mariana.

1223
01:00:28.833 --> 01:00:31.708
Or the guy for whom you left us
to move to Reynosa.

1224
01:00:31.791 --> 01:00:33.083
for how many years. Ale?

1225
01:00:33.166 --> 01:00:35.041
No. Mariana.
I won't be part of this.

1226
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:39.375
Sometimes you win.
sometimes you lose.

1227
01:00:39.916 --> 01:00:41.583
That's love.

1228
01:00:42.208 --> 01:00:43.333
You're old enough.

1229
01:00:43.416 --> 01:00:45.250
Mom. we just want you
to be happy.

1230
01:00:45.333 --> 01:00:46.291
We mean it.

1231
01:00:46.375 --> 01:00:48.500
Mom. when can we tell you
you're fucking it up?

1232
01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:50.791
Or we're not allowed because
you changed our diapers?

1233
01:00:51.541 --> 01:00:53.708
Don't you see you've done this
all your life?

1234
01:00:53.791 --> 01:00:55.041
You don't know how to be
on your own. Mom.

1235
01:00:55.125 --> 01:00:57.458
You're afraid of commitment.
You can't keep a boyfriend.

1236
01:00:57.583 --> 01:00:58.791
You couldn't keep us!

1237
01:00:58.875 --> 01:01:00.583
- Girl. stop!
- Stop what. Alejandra?

1238
01:01:02.083 --> 01:01:04.333
If it wasn't for our grandparents.
where would we be?

1239
01:01:05.083 --> 01:01:06.125
On the street. right?

1240
01:01:06.875 --> 01:01:07.958
Ah!

1241
01:01:11.708 --> 01:01:13.583
Own up

1242
01:01:14.583 --> 01:01:17.625
and align your chakras.
dear Mariana.

1243
01:01:17.708 --> 01:01:19.625
Don't call me that!
You own up. Mom!

1244
01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:21.750
You know what?
Do whatever you want.

1245
01:01:22.166 --> 01:01:23.833
But don't expect me
to celebrate.

1246
01:01:25.583 --> 01:01:27.250
I think Mariana wants
to be alone. Mom.

1247
01:01:27.666 --> 01:01:28.708
Let's go.

1248
01:01:33.125 --> 01:01:34.500
Oh. for fuck's sake!

1249
01:01:43.125 --> 01:01:45.625
You'll feel better.
You'll see.

1250
01:01:45.708 --> 01:01:47.833
What a mess
we made yesterday!

1251
01:01:49.250 --> 01:01:51.833
Now. let's kill it
on the dancefloor.

1252
01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:53.250
Are you ready?

1253
01:01:54.375 --> 01:01:56.125
Ah. yes. I've practiced
my best moves.

1254
01:01:56.208 --> 01:01:58.416
No. Luis. I'm not feeling good.

1255
01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.375
Mariana wanted to kill me yesterday

1256
01:02:00.458 --> 01:02:02.416
with her cactus pills
and her wicked hatred.

1257
01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:03.916
It's just a dance.
and it'll be over.

1258
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.500
No. dude.
I don't want to do it.

1259
01:02:06.583 --> 01:02:07.833
- Ah. you don't want to.
- No.

1260
01:02:07.916 --> 01:02:09.166
You don't want to.

1261
01:02:09.333 --> 01:02:11.250
I didn't want to clean
the mess

1262
01:02:11.333 --> 01:02:13.416
you left in the bathroom.
but I did it.

1263
01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:14.666
That was part of the deal.

1264
01:02:14.791 --> 01:02:16.375
Come on. you can piss off later
if you want.

1265
01:02:16.458 --> 01:02:18.458
We say bye. Bye! Come on.

1266
01:02:18.541 --> 01:02:20.750
What about all the times
you threw up in my bar?

1267
01:02:20.916 --> 01:02:21.833
What about that?

1268
01:02:22.708 --> 01:02:24.291
- Disgusting.
- It's a bar.

1269
01:02:24.416 --> 01:02:27.000
Okay.
He's right. Let's go.

1270
01:02:27.083 --> 01:02:28.250
No.

1271
01:02:28.375 --> 01:02:30.291
Luis can talk to Mariana.

1272
01:02:30.458 --> 01:02:32.333
They can handle it like adults.

1273
01:02:32.416 --> 01:02:33.666
That's none of your business.

1274
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:36.583
Yeah. it is your business.
Dancing. especially.

1275
01:02:37.166 --> 01:02:39.125
- Come.
- Listen. Luis.

1276
01:02:39.250 --> 01:02:42.208
Listen. you know that
after the wedding

1277
01:02:42.291 --> 01:02:43.750
you'll never see her again.

1278
01:02:44.416 --> 01:02:46.625
Of course. that's the point.

1279
01:02:47.208 --> 01:02:48.750
Now. we can call it off
if you want.

1280
01:02:49.666 --> 01:02:52.625
Goodbye. wedding.
And you go back to Colombia.

1281
01:02:53.250 --> 01:02:55.166
No. No.

1282
01:02:55.625 --> 01:02:57.708
- We have the cake figurines.
- Right.

1283
01:02:57.791 --> 01:03:00.375
I can't believe it.
You two sound like kids.

1284
01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:04.083
I thought I could put up
with this... but I can't...

1285
01:03:04.166 --> 01:03:05.333
What?

1286
01:03:05.416 --> 01:03:06.416
- No. I'm fucking done!
- Wait.

1287
01:03:07.458 --> 01:03:09.250
- What?
- Babe!

1288
01:03:09.375 --> 01:03:10.750
We made a deal.

1289
01:03:11.041 --> 01:03:12.833
Babe. don't go!

1290
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:18.250
I'm sorry.
I don't know what's going on.

1291
01:03:19.208 --> 01:03:20.291
Don't worry.

1292
01:03:22.166 --> 01:03:23.958
- Hey. sorry.
- Finally.

1293
01:03:24.208 --> 01:03:25.916
Lucia can't come.

1294
01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:28.666
She's not feeling well.
Maybe nervousness. I don't know.

1295
01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:30.083
Maybe she's getting cold feet.

1296
01:03:30.625 --> 01:03:32.791
What? No.
She's a good person.

1297
01:03:33.208 --> 01:03:35.208
So. can I see the steps?

1298
01:03:35.291 --> 01:03:37.125
Then I'll learn them
and teach her.

1299
01:03:37.291 --> 01:03:40.625
- Are they the ones you sent me?
- Yeah. the same three steps.

1300
01:03:40.791 --> 01:03:42.708
- Here's the music.
- Let's play it. and then you leave.

1301
01:03:42.791 --> 01:03:43.750
Yeah.

1302
01:03:43.833 --> 01:03:45.583
Do it together. please.

1303
01:03:45.666 --> 01:03:47.208
- What?
- Yeah. you two.

1304
01:03:47.291 --> 01:03:48.375
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

1305
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:53.000
Our song?

1306
01:03:53.208 --> 01:03:54.666
- You're fucking kidding me. Luis!
- What?

1307
01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:56.333
- You're fucking kidding me!
- It's a song.

1308
01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.708
Okay. let's begin.

1309
01:03:59.041 --> 01:04:00.000
So. fan...

1310
01:04:03.166 --> 01:04:04.250
Snake...

1311
01:04:05.833 --> 01:04:06.875
Chest. chest.

1312
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.250
Horse riding.

1313
01:04:14.833 --> 01:04:16.333
Flow. flow.

1314
01:04:27.458 --> 01:04:28.541
Buddha.

1315
01:04:36.791 --> 01:04:37.833
Egyptian.

1316
01:04:41.791 --> 01:04:43.666
- Hold him!
- What?

1317
01:04:43.833 --> 01:04:44.916
Hold him.

1318
01:04:57.791 --> 01:05:01.541
Okay. here comes the kiss.
but well. not now.

1319
01:05:01.625 --> 01:05:02.708
No.

1320
01:05:03.208 --> 01:05:04.958
- Yeah. I think...
- No.

1321
01:05:07.083 --> 01:05:08.583
Well. I'll teach Lucia.

1322
01:05:25.208 --> 01:05:26.791
Don't come. please.

1323
01:05:31.125 --> 01:05:32.375
So. what do you think?

1324
01:05:32.583 --> 01:05:33.875
It was good. right?

1325
01:05:36.166 --> 01:05:39.625
I can picture myself
riding the horse in the party.

1326
01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:44.041
Do you have any plans?

1327
01:05:44.333 --> 01:05:47.458
I'd like you to taste
the wedding's menu.

1328
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:49.833
So we'd have to go
to the restaurant.

1329
01:05:49.916 --> 01:05:52.541
But I don't know if
you want... can...

1330
01:05:52.625 --> 01:05:54.166
- Sure.
- Sounds good?

1331
01:05:54.291 --> 01:05:57.333
Thanks. but
Ale is waiting for me.

1332
01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:59.166
Guess what?

1333
01:06:00.208 --> 01:06:01.791
My mom is getting married again.

1334
01:06:02.583 --> 01:06:03.500
No.

1335
01:06:04.458 --> 01:06:06.083
It's okay. don't worry.

1336
01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:09.083
You have a more important
wedding at the moment.

1337
01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:11.791
No problem. I understand.

1338
01:06:15.458 --> 01:06:16.500
Okay. let's go.

1339
01:06:17.041 --> 01:06:18.416
Yeah. let's go.

1340
01:06:21.166 --> 01:06:22.166
Oh. fuck!

1341
01:06:27.791 --> 01:06:28.708
It's...

1342
01:06:28.916 --> 01:06:29.833
There.

1343
01:06:32.958 --> 01:06:34.041
Almost there.

1344
01:06:35.208 --> 01:06:36.208
Here we are.

1345
01:06:42.166 --> 01:06:43.625
Please. come in.

1346
01:06:47.666 --> 01:06:50.041
As you can see.
I haven't done much.

1347
01:06:50.916 --> 01:06:53.166
Except for the menu. of course.

1348
01:06:53.375 --> 01:06:54.625
But the rest

1349
01:06:54.875 --> 01:06:56.666
still needs your help.

1350
01:07:06.208 --> 01:07:08.000
I couldn't give it
any other name.

1351
01:07:08.416 --> 01:07:09.333
Right?

1352
01:07:15.875 --> 01:07:17.375
Don't be so full of yourself.

1353
01:07:17.458 --> 01:07:19.291
but this fucking muffin
tastes so good.

1354
01:07:19.708 --> 01:07:20.750
Why?

1355
01:07:20.833 --> 01:07:24.083
You can't say a tiramisu
is a muffin. No.

1356
01:07:24.166 --> 01:07:26.041
Forgive me. forgive me. please.

1357
01:07:26.208 --> 01:07:29.083
Enlighten me with your
bakery knowledge.

1358
01:07:29.208 --> 01:07:30.958
Because you studied in...?

1359
01:07:31.208 --> 01:07:34.041
Where did you study?
In Paris?

1360
01:07:34.958 --> 01:07:35.916
Oui. Oui.

1361
01:07:37.333 --> 01:07:40.458
- Where?
- Je studied at the "bakerie."

1362
01:07:40.583 --> 01:07:42.833
- Oui. Oui.
- The "cakerie..."

1363
01:07:42.916 --> 01:07:43.750
Oui. Oui.

1364
01:07:48.208 --> 01:07:49.291
Thanks.

1365
01:07:50.416 --> 01:07:53.291
Thanks for planning my wedding.

1366
01:07:53.416 --> 01:07:54.875
For dancing with me.

1367
01:07:57.041 --> 01:07:58.500
For this. Thanks.

1368
01:08:00.166 --> 01:08:01.291
Let's toast to the...

1369
01:08:02.208 --> 01:08:03.916
to your restaurant.

1370
01:08:04.166 --> 01:08:05.875
which I'm sure will be
a success.

1371
01:08:06.708 --> 01:08:09.916
Not as much as if it were
our restaurant.

1372
01:08:11.083 --> 01:08:12.000
But cheers.

1373
01:08:12.708 --> 01:08:13.666
Cheers.

1374
01:08:23.833 --> 01:08:26.250
Your mom is getting married.
right?

1375
01:08:28.375 --> 01:08:29.500
Again.

1376
01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:33.625
Why can't she be like
your parents?

1377
01:08:33.708 --> 01:08:36.583
How have they managed to love
each other for years?

1378
01:08:36.666 --> 01:08:37.833
I have no idea.

1379
01:08:37.916 --> 01:08:41.500
I've wondered that so many times.
I have no idea.

1380
01:08:45.875 --> 01:08:46.833
I'm scared.

1381
01:08:49.208 --> 01:08:50.791
that my life will turn into this.

1382
01:08:52.166 --> 01:08:54.208
My mom fails. Ale fails.

1383
01:08:55.166 --> 01:08:56.166
I fail.

1384
01:08:56.791 --> 01:08:58.166
We hold each other.

1385
01:08:59.625 --> 01:09:00.541
Was it that?

1386
01:09:04.166 --> 01:09:06.250
- It was that. wasn't it?
- Luis.

1387
01:09:43.250 --> 01:09:44.666
Do you want more tiramisu?

1388
01:09:46.333 --> 01:09:47.458
Luis.

1389
01:09:49.125 --> 01:09:50.125
What?

1390
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.083
Where are they?

1391
01:09:52.166 --> 01:09:53.625
Where are my clothes?

1392
01:09:53.791 --> 01:09:55.708
Wait. Mariana.

1393
01:09:56.208 --> 01:09:58.000
- Hey. I think...
- Here. wear this.

1394
01:09:58.208 --> 01:10:00.500
I think...
I should go. Luis.

1395
01:10:00.583 --> 01:10:02.583
- Why?
- What do you mean "why"?

1396
01:10:02.666 --> 01:10:03.500
No.

1397
01:10:03.625 --> 01:10:06.541
Okay. wait.
Please. wait.

1398
01:10:06.916 --> 01:10:07.833
Wait. Mariana.

1399
01:10:07.916 --> 01:10:08.958
- Listen. please.
- I want to go!

1400
01:10:09.041 --> 01:10:10.000
Listen!

1401
01:10:10.291 --> 01:10:11.416
Lucia and I...

1402
01:10:11.583 --> 01:10:14.083
Oh. don't mention Lucia now.
Please. Luis.

1403
01:10:14.166 --> 01:10:15.541
I don't love Lucia!

1404
01:10:15.625 --> 01:10:17.750
I'll call off the wedding with her
and marry you.

1405
01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:21.333
You didn't get a thing.
right. Luis?

1406
01:10:21.416 --> 01:10:22.500
What didn't I get?

1407
01:10:22.625 --> 01:10:25.583
Weren't you going to dance
our song in your wedding?

1408
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:27.958
Are you a psycho? Or what. Luis?

1409
01:10:28.125 --> 01:10:29.583
- Excuse me? A psycho?
- Yes.

1410
01:10:29.833 --> 01:10:31.125
May I remind you who thought
of planning

1411
01:10:31.208 --> 01:10:32.791
this whole wedding thing?
Psycho?

1412
01:10:32.875 --> 01:10:34.208
Of course I wanted
to dance my song.

1413
01:10:34.291 --> 01:10:36.125
- Your song?
- in the wedding only I wanted.

1414
01:10:36.208 --> 01:10:38.125
- It was our song. Luis.
- Only I wanted it!

1415
01:10:38.208 --> 01:10:39.625
Our song
and my wedding. by myself.

1416
01:10:39.708 --> 01:10:42.291
Perfect. if our song works
for your plan B.

1417
01:10:42.375 --> 01:10:43.958
dance our song
with your plan B.

1418
01:10:44.041 --> 01:10:45.708
How do you know you weren't
my plan B?

1419
01:10:45.791 --> 01:10:48.416
Luis. you only want
to marry anyone.

1420
01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:49.708
- No matter what.
- With you.

1421
01:10:49.791 --> 01:10:51.083
I didn't want to get married.
and you knew it.

1422
01:10:51.166 --> 01:10:52.958
and you asked me
and fucked it up.

1423
01:10:53.041 --> 01:10:54.791
- That's clear.
- And fucked up everything we had.

1424
01:10:54.875 --> 01:10:56.708
But you know what?
I left you the restaurant.

1425
01:10:56.791 --> 01:10:57.958
- Ah. you left me the restaurant?
- Yes.

1426
01:10:58.041 --> 01:11:00.291
- Thanks.
- Life goes on. get married!

1427
01:11:00.375 --> 01:11:01.541
I'm getting married.
I'm getting married.

1428
01:11:01.666 --> 01:11:03.333
Get married and have
your fucking wedding!

1429
01:11:03.416 --> 01:11:04.708
Sure. thank you very much.

1430
01:11:04.916 --> 01:11:06.416
Fuck!

1431
01:11:15.583 --> 01:11:17.208
Ah. I'm so stupid!

1432
01:11:40.916 --> 01:11:42.125
Oh. shit!

1433
01:11:43.166 --> 01:11:46.000
Hey. Ma'am.
Miss. Mariana.

1434
01:11:46.166 --> 01:11:47.750
How was your dance?

1435
01:11:48.625 --> 01:11:50.500
Hey. Dioni.

1436
01:11:51.416 --> 01:11:52.875
Nice to see you.

1437
01:11:57.125 --> 01:12:00.166
Okay. You should go.
There's a crisis.

1438
01:12:00.458 --> 01:12:01.625
Goodbye. gorgeous.

1439
01:12:08.541 --> 01:12:11.083
I don't care if he's your boyfriend.
but why are you hiding him?

1440
01:12:11.541 --> 01:12:14.125
I'm not hiding him.
Sometimes I don't tell you things

1441
01:12:14.208 --> 01:12:16.583
because. as always.
your problems are priority.

1442
01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:19.250
There are more things you need
to tell me. besides you dating him.

1443
01:12:19.333 --> 01:12:22.375
I'm not dating him.
I just hate your lectures.

1444
01:12:22.583 --> 01:12:23.791
- Okay.
- Okay.

1445
01:12:24.583 --> 01:12:26.708
I just think your life
hasn't been good lately.

1446
01:12:26.833 --> 01:12:28.208
Oh. fuck!
You're fucking kidding me. Mariana!

1447
01:12:28.291 --> 01:12:29.750
Are you serious?
It's great. isn't it?

1448
01:12:29.833 --> 01:12:31.416
It's great that I'm always
the one with issues.

1449
01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:34.125
My life is perfect.
I don't have issues.

1450
01:12:34.208 --> 01:12:35.500
You're the one with the issues.

1451
01:12:35.583 --> 01:12:38.833
You're the one planning a wedding
for an asshole who's over you!

1452
01:12:38.916 --> 01:12:40.583
He's over you. Mariana!

1453
01:12:40.666 --> 01:12:42.333
If you're so sure.
why are you living in my house?

1454
01:12:42.416 --> 01:12:43.833
Ah. I'm glad
we're thinking the same.

1455
01:12:43.916 --> 01:12:44.958
- I'm leaving.
- Go on!

1456
01:12:45.041 --> 01:12:47.083
I'm leaving. You know what?
I hope you're happy

1457
01:12:47.166 --> 01:12:48.125
because I'm leaving
far. far away for a while.

1458
01:12:48.208 --> 01:12:49.583
That sounds perfect.

1459
01:12:49.666 --> 01:12:50.708
What...?

1460
01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:54.000
Shit. did you get
the scholarship? Ale!

1461
01:12:56.916 --> 01:12:58.625
I don't understand him.
I don't understand Ale.

1462
01:12:58.708 --> 01:12:59.666
I don't understand my mom.

1463
01:13:00.416 --> 01:13:02.791
I don't get why everyone
is against me now.

1464
01:13:02.875 --> 01:13:04.500
Then she said it's her house.

1465
01:13:04.583 --> 01:13:06.333
Then why did she let me stay?

1466
01:13:06.416 --> 01:13:08.166
- Well. Ale. I think...
- What's next. Mom?

1467
01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:11.250
I can't eat there?
I can't shower? What?

1468
01:13:11.333 --> 01:13:16.625
She kicked me out.
as if I was undesired.

1469
01:13:16.708 --> 01:13:19.541
And if I know something.
if I'm sure about something.

1470
01:13:19.625 --> 01:13:22.500
it's that I'm a very
desired person.

1471
01:13:22.583 --> 01:13:24.333
I hate them! I hate them!

1472
01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:25.583
I hate her!

1473
01:13:26.458 --> 01:13:27.583
I hate her!

1474
01:13:28.541 --> 01:13:29.750
I don't. you know?

1475
01:13:30.083 --> 01:13:31.166
No.

1476
01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:34.750
No. from now on. Mariana is over.
It's done.

1477
01:13:34.958 --> 01:13:36.291
It's over.

1478
01:13:37.458 --> 01:13:38.541
You were right.

1479
01:13:38.666 --> 01:13:41.208
This is the cleverest shit
I've ever done.

1480
01:13:41.708 --> 01:13:44.708
I met the true Mariana.

1481
01:13:45.625 --> 01:13:48.375
and I don't want her.

1482
01:13:49.916 --> 01:13:51.000
You're right.

1483
01:13:51.833 --> 01:13:54.250
What is it?
Did you fix your thing with Ramona?

1484
01:13:54.541 --> 01:13:57.166
No. she left me.

1485
01:13:57.833 --> 01:14:00.208
I liked that girl.
And I think she liked me too.

1486
01:14:00.708 --> 01:14:03.416
But well. I have priorities.

1487
01:14:03.541 --> 01:14:05.125
Don't tell me it was
my fault.

1488
01:14:06.250 --> 01:14:09.166
Yeah. basically. buddy.

1489
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:12.416
It is complicated to show
someone you love them

1490
01:14:12.541 --> 01:14:14.250
when you're marrying
somebody else.

1491
01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:17.750
But well. this will be over
in two days.

1492
01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:20.333
Cheers.

1493
01:15:16.250 --> 01:15:17.083
Are you okay?

1494
01:15:18.166 --> 01:15:19.708
Ale will be in charge of the flowers

1495
01:15:19.791 --> 01:15:22.083
and the DJ will be here
at ten to set everything up.

1496
01:15:22.291 --> 01:15:26.333
The judge will be here at six.
and Luis will bring the tiramisu.

1497
01:15:27.166 --> 01:15:29.250
Girl. why did you give him
the ring back?

1498
01:15:30.583 --> 01:15:32.708
Because I never wanted to get
married. and he knew it.

1499
01:15:33.583 --> 01:15:34.833
I was never sure.

1500
01:15:35.166 --> 01:15:37.208
and then I saw myself.
standing there like an idiot.

1501
01:15:37.333 --> 01:15:40.125
in the middle of everything
he was arranging.

1502
01:15:40.208 --> 01:15:41.375
And what did you want?

1503
01:15:42.291 --> 01:15:43.500
I didn't want to suffer.

1504
01:15:44.083 --> 01:15:45.916
and I didn't want him
to suffer either.

1505
01:15:46.291 --> 01:15:48.083
Ah. that's good. then.

1506
01:15:49.208 --> 01:15:50.083
So good. because you know what?

1507
01:15:50.166 --> 01:15:53.083
Right now. none of you
is suffering.

1508
01:15:53.458 --> 01:15:55.625
Great.
you made a great decision.

1509
01:15:57.208 --> 01:15:59.041
Mariana. from all the people
who come here.

1510
01:15:59.125 --> 01:16:00.666
imagine about...

1511
01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:02.750
how many do you think are sure
they want to get married?

1512
01:16:03.250 --> 01:16:04.291
I don't know.

1513
01:16:04.666 --> 01:16:06.958
Not even one.
But what's our job?

1514
01:16:07.458 --> 01:16:08.875
Make them believe
they love each other

1515
01:16:08.958 --> 01:16:10.166
and charge them a lot of money?

1516
01:16:10.833 --> 01:16:11.875
Listen. darling.

1517
01:16:12.458 --> 01:16:15.875
nobody knows if they'll be happy
in the future.

1518
01:16:16.375 --> 01:16:17.375
And that's okay. right?

1519
01:16:18.333 --> 01:16:20.125
Let people believe
they can be happy.

1520
01:16:20.541 --> 01:16:21.791
No.

1521
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:32.291
Sorry. I didn't want to hurt you
this way.

1522
01:16:32.375 --> 01:16:33.458
It wasn't my intention...

1523
01:16:34.333 --> 01:16:36.708
To get this far.

1524
01:16:37.208 --> 01:16:39.791
That's why I'm here.
before you.

1525
01:16:40.583 --> 01:16:41.666
my best friend.

1526
01:16:42.041 --> 01:16:43.666
well. before you two.

1527
01:16:45.166 --> 01:16:48.833
Now you'll taste the most
romantic.

1528
01:16:48.916 --> 01:16:51.458
most delicious meal
I've made.

1529
01:16:51.791 --> 01:16:54.708
But first.
some wine of forgiveness.

1530
01:16:54.791 --> 01:16:57.291
To forgive each other.

1531
01:16:58.500 --> 01:16:59.500
Ramona.

1532
01:17:00.208 --> 01:17:02.041
I've never seen Lucia

1533
01:17:03.166 --> 01:17:05.000
so happy with someone.
I mean it.

1534
01:17:05.833 --> 01:17:08.166
This was all my fault.
I started this mess

1535
01:17:08.250 --> 01:17:10.250
and now I'm doing it

1536
01:17:10.375 --> 01:17:11.958
for her own happiness.

1537
01:17:12.041 --> 01:17:15.166
Yeah. I did it for our happiness.

1538
01:17:15.250 --> 01:17:16.875
For our possible future.

1539
01:17:17.375 --> 01:17:19.041
I mean. possible.

1540
01:17:19.166 --> 01:17:22.041
not certain. but possible.

1541
01:17:22.708 --> 01:17:24.541
But still you're getting married.

1542
01:17:24.916 --> 01:17:28.458
Yeah. but we're ending this
on the weekend. right. Luis?

1543
01:17:28.875 --> 01:17:29.791
Absolutely.

1544
01:17:41.208 --> 01:17:43.125
That's right!

1545
01:17:43.625 --> 01:17:46.333
You didn't even try
the wine of forgiveness.

1546
01:17:46.416 --> 01:17:47.750
Thanks. Luis.

1547
01:17:48.208 --> 01:17:51.166
If you need a bartender.
call me.

1548
01:17:51.291 --> 01:17:52.833
No. actually.
if you need a cook.

1549
01:17:52.958 --> 01:17:56.625
let me know. because I need
to sell this place.

1550
01:17:56.708 --> 01:17:58.208
Just like that. Luis?

1551
01:17:58.333 --> 01:17:59.583
This was your dream.

1552
01:17:59.916 --> 01:18:03.125
No. it was our dream.
Mariana's and mine.

1553
01:18:03.375 --> 01:18:04.625
I can't do it on my own.

1554
01:18:15.791 --> 01:18:16.916
This is yours.

1555
01:18:17.333 --> 01:18:18.583
Thank you.

1556
01:18:21.666 --> 01:18:22.708
Bon appÃ©tit.

1557
01:18:34.458 --> 01:18:37.166
Are you ready for your trip?

1558
01:18:46.166 --> 01:18:49.250
So should we break up
officially?

1559
01:18:51.166 --> 01:18:53.458
We never dated officially.

1560
01:18:54.166 --> 01:18:56.333
Of course. This makes things
simpler. right?

1561
01:18:59.583 --> 01:19:01.375
Did you tell Luis about me?

1562
01:19:03.791 --> 01:19:04.833
No.

1563
01:19:08.458 --> 01:19:09.875
See? There you go.

1564
01:19:12.166 --> 01:19:13.500
Everything was good and...

1565
01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:15.750
What's happening to us?

1566
01:19:16.416 --> 01:19:17.541
So awkward.

1567
01:19:19.833 --> 01:19:22.416
Not everything was so awkward.
was it?

1568
01:19:28.833 --> 01:19:29.958
Not so much.

1569
01:19:33.583 --> 01:19:36.916
Ale. what if we hang out until
you leave?

1570
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.666
I can help you pack
a few canned peppers.

1571
01:19:41.916 --> 01:19:45.541
sauces.
frozen tortillas.

1572
01:19:45.708 --> 01:19:47.166
Do you want flowers?

1573
01:19:47.250 --> 01:19:48.791
I can run after the plane.

1574
01:19:49.708 --> 01:19:52.166
and that's it.
you live happily ever after.

1575
01:19:58.791 --> 01:20:02.583
No. I mean. the plane thing
was a joke.

1576
01:20:02.916 --> 01:20:04.250
I know it's not possible.

1577
01:20:12.250 --> 01:20:13.416
I'm leaving.

1578
01:20:15.916 --> 01:20:18.916
See you sometime.

1579
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Well.

1580
01:20:20.125 --> 01:20:21.250
goodbye.

1581
01:20:23.458 --> 01:20:26.083
I liked us being
each other's secret.

1582
01:20:26.916 --> 01:20:27.750
Thank you.

1583
01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:44.416
Will you forgive me?

1584
01:20:46.250 --> 01:20:48.541
What I told you wasn't cool.
and wasn't my intention.

1585
01:20:49.416 --> 01:20:50.500
It's just that...

1586
01:20:51.208 --> 01:20:52.958
I don't know what I want.

1587
01:20:54.708 --> 01:20:56.375
You know.

1588
01:20:57.916 --> 01:21:00.250
You don't want to be afraid.

1589
01:21:04.166 --> 01:21:05.750
You're never afraid.

1590
01:21:12.625 --> 01:21:13.791
Where were you?

1591
01:21:15.833 --> 01:21:17.291
What if I get too cold?

1592
01:21:17.916 --> 01:21:20.708
What if I miss my tortillas
and screw everything up?

1593
01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:23.791
And you can't do anything
without me.

1594
01:21:23.875 --> 01:21:25.208
This girl...

1595
01:21:28.208 --> 01:21:29.125
Hi.

1596
01:21:29.875 --> 01:21:31.125
Hi. sister.

1597
01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:34.958
I'm sorry. sister.

1598
01:21:38.166 --> 01:21:39.375
Forgive me.

1599
01:21:40.791 --> 01:21:42.541
Oh. I'm gonna miss you so much.

1600
01:21:52.875 --> 01:21:55.125
These are some of the weddings
we've planned.

1601
01:21:56.875 --> 01:21:59.458
and this one. this one.

1602
01:22:00.166 --> 01:22:01.166
this one.

1603
01:22:01.708 --> 01:22:02.916
and this one

1604
01:22:03.666 --> 01:22:05.208
ended up in a divorce.

1605
01:22:07.208 --> 01:22:08.958
I don't want Luis
to go through that.

1606
01:22:11.708 --> 01:22:13.875
I've never understood why
I do this for a living.

1607
01:22:15.166 --> 01:22:17.083
I think I used to think I could
understand the couples.

1608
01:22:17.166 --> 01:22:18.333
their love.

1609
01:22:18.875 --> 01:22:20.791
and so I could plan the perfect
wedding for them.

1610
01:22:22.250 --> 01:22:23.958
but the truth is I can't.

1611
01:22:25.625 --> 01:22:27.250
For that reason. this will be
my last wedding.

1612
01:22:46.916 --> 01:22:48.250
It's amazing. Mariana.

1613
01:22:56.541 --> 01:22:58.291
You also deserve happiness.

1614
01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:11.333
Let's sign it. and it's over.

1615
01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:15.541
Luis. are you sure you want me
to keep the rings?

1616
01:23:16.875 --> 01:23:19.125
I'm very nervous about
keeping them.

1617
01:23:20.666 --> 01:23:21.791
Why me?

1618
01:23:22.166 --> 01:23:24.000
Relax. breathe.

1619
01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:26.916
You're the godfather.

1620
01:23:30.833 --> 01:23:33.000
Look how beautiful she looks.

1621
01:23:36.166 --> 01:23:38.958
What?
But that's not the dress.

1622
01:23:39.041 --> 01:23:40.916
No way.
Is that the dress?

1623
01:23:41.166 --> 01:23:42.250
What do you mean. Luis?

1624
01:23:42.333 --> 01:23:45.250
A white dress. the wedding.
Fucking Mariana!

1625
01:23:46.291 --> 01:23:47.375
Hey.

1626
01:23:48.250 --> 01:23:49.458
There was a mistake.

1627
01:23:50.250 --> 01:23:52.125
My sister is sending you this.

1628
01:23:53.458 --> 01:23:55.625
- Ah!
- Uh. no.

1629
01:23:55.708 --> 01:23:57.791
No. you know what?
This one kinda grew on me.

1630
01:23:57.875 --> 01:23:59.041
I feel fantastic.

1631
01:23:59.458 --> 01:24:00.833
Okay. sounds good.

1632
01:24:01.166 --> 01:24:02.250
Babe.

1633
01:24:03.958 --> 01:24:06.500
Attention. everyone.
I need to make a confession.

1634
01:24:07.916 --> 01:24:11.375
I've been having consensual
and affective

1635
01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:15.333
sexual intercourse
with Alejandra.

1636
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.166
Dioni.

1637
01:24:18.333 --> 01:24:20.833
And these were the most beautiful
weeks of my life.

1638
01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:22.583
But well.

1639
01:24:23.208 --> 01:24:27.000
Ale is in a very
important mission.

1640
01:24:27.750 --> 01:24:30.625
I'll treasure the memories
of this sweet love

1641
01:24:30.708 --> 01:24:31.791
that grew between us.

1642
01:24:33.750 --> 01:24:35.333
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1643
01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:37.041
There's no time to waste.

1644
01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:38.916
Hey?

1645
01:24:39.958 --> 01:24:43.541
My best friend is getting married.
Congratulations!

1646
01:24:43.666 --> 01:24:44.583
Thank you.

1647
01:25:08.208 --> 01:25:12.208
Good evening to the newlyweds.
their family and friends.

1648
01:25:12.750 --> 01:25:17.708
We're about to start the ceremony
to legally bind you.

1649
01:25:18.166 --> 01:25:20.166
Lucia and Luis.

1650
01:25:20.666 --> 01:25:24.083
Are you doing this of your
own free will. Luis and Lucia?

1651
01:25:24.875 --> 01:25:26.041
LuiCia.

1652
01:25:27.208 --> 01:25:31.125
Do you wish to
get married today?

1653
01:25:31.583 --> 01:25:32.708
- That's right.
- Good.

1654
01:25:32.875 --> 01:25:34.750
Please. bring the rings.

1655
01:25:34.833 --> 01:25:35.916
Oh. of course.

1656
01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:44.791
Oh. no!

1657
01:25:46.083 --> 01:25:48.166
Ah! Here.

1658
01:25:50.833 --> 01:25:53.125
Before continuing the ceremony

1659
01:25:53.208 --> 01:25:55.166
I have to ask

1660
01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:57.708
does anyone here oppose

1661
01:25:57.791 --> 01:26:00.250
to the union of these two people?

1662
01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:13.375
All right. Let's proceed
to the ring exchange.

1663
01:26:24.125 --> 01:26:26.333
In the end you realize
the only thing that matters

1664
01:26:26.875 --> 01:26:28.166
are the smiles.

1665
01:26:28.583 --> 01:26:30.083
the moments you share.

1666
01:26:34.958 --> 01:26:36.541
the support you give
each other.

1667
01:26:40.208 --> 01:26:41.375
Please.

1668
01:26:47.791 --> 01:26:49.208
When you find
true love.

1669
01:26:49.375 --> 01:26:51.791
you have no option
but to take a leap and scream...

1670
01:26:53.208 --> 01:26:54.208
I love you.

1671
01:26:56.291 --> 01:26:57.250
Oh. no.

1672
01:26:58.750 --> 01:27:01.166
Please. follow me. sir.
your Majesty.

1673
01:27:01.250 --> 01:27:03.208
We trust blindly
in this country's laws.

1674
01:27:03.291 --> 01:27:05.500
- Come on. quick!
- What did I just say?

1675
01:27:05.583 --> 01:27:07.791
Mariana what did you do?
What are you saying?

1676
01:27:09.041 --> 01:27:11.041
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

1677
01:27:11.875 --> 01:27:13.000
Nothing.

1678
01:27:15.166 --> 01:27:16.500
No. don't give me that look.

1679
01:27:16.583 --> 01:27:18.625
It's okay. It's all cool.

1680
01:27:18.833 --> 01:27:21.250
- What did you say?
- I just want you to be happy.

1681
01:27:21.708 --> 01:27:22.833
What did you say?

1682
01:27:24.166 --> 01:27:25.083
Lucia?

1683
01:27:25.833 --> 01:27:26.916
Take care of him.

1684
01:27:28.666 --> 01:27:32.000
Well. I was on my way out.
I'm leaving.

1685
01:27:32.166 --> 01:27:33.916
I love you. Ale.
I love you. Mom.

1686
01:27:34.250 --> 01:27:35.791
I love you. Luis's aunt.

1687
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.125
I love you. Luis.

1688
01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.625
I'm leaving.
Yes.

1689
01:27:40.708 --> 01:27:42.000
No. Mariana. hold on.

1690
01:27:42.125 --> 01:27:43.500
I love you. Lucia.

1691
01:27:49.833 --> 01:27:51.416
What?
What's going on?

1692
01:27:52.166 --> 01:27:55.250
I fucked it up from
the very beginning.

1693
01:27:55.333 --> 01:27:56.916
What do you mean you fucked it up?
You were wrong.

1694
01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.041
- Yeah. I...
- Oh. no. I knew it.

1695
01:27:59.125 --> 01:28:01.125
- I wanted to annoy you.
- You're a psycho liar.

1696
01:28:01.208 --> 01:28:02.291
- Yes. I'm a psycho. a liar.
- What's wrong with you?

1697
01:28:02.375 --> 01:28:03.666
and asshole. Yes.

1698
01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:06.250
- You made a huge mess.
- I'm an asshole. an asshole.

1699
01:28:06.333 --> 01:28:07.708
But I love you.
I love you.

1700
01:28:08.208 --> 01:28:09.750
- Sorry.
- Yes.

1701
01:28:10.208 --> 01:28:12.250
I love you. Mariana. so much.

1702
01:28:13.708 --> 01:28:14.916
Me too.

1703
01:28:16.208 --> 01:28:19.083
- I still don't want to get married.
- That's okay.

1704
01:28:19.166 --> 01:28:20.250
I don't want to live thinking

1705
01:28:20.333 --> 01:28:21.625
that the best day of our lives
has passed.

1706
01:28:21.708 --> 01:28:23.958
No. nobody wants to get married.
Who wants to get married?

1707
01:28:24.041 --> 01:28:24.875
Do I want to get married?
No.

1708
01:28:25.708 --> 01:28:29.166
You should've thought about that
before doing this.

1709
01:28:29.583 --> 01:28:30.708
I'm sorry.

1710
01:28:30.875 --> 01:28:32.458
The best days of our lives...

1711
01:28:32.875 --> 01:28:34.500
can they happen anytime
in the future?

1712
01:28:35.875 --> 01:28:37.000
Every day.

1713
01:28:37.750 --> 01:28:39.916
Can we start today?

1714
01:28:41.666 --> 01:28:42.833
Okay. yes.

1715
01:28:43.208 --> 01:28:45.791
Besides. if we don't get married.
we can't get a divorce.

1716
01:28:45.875 --> 01:28:47.083
Oh. shut up!

1717
01:28:58.041 --> 01:28:59.416
Dear. beautiful audience.

1718
01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:02.000
give it up for the newlyweds.

1719
01:29:02.833 --> 01:29:04.083
Oh. I mean.

1720
01:29:04.166 --> 01:29:05.791
I mean. the couples.

1721
01:29:05.875 --> 01:29:09.208
the girlfriends.
the lifetime lovers. Damn!

1722
01:29:10.666 --> 01:29:12.250
What a night! What a night!

1723
01:29:12.333 --> 01:29:13.791
H-H-H-He-Hey.

1724

This is D-D-D-D-J Dioni.

1725
01:29:16.291 --> 01:29:18.208
livening up the best parties.

1726
01:29:18.291 --> 01:29:21.166
Now I'm gonna leave you
with a hit

1727
01:29:21.250 --> 01:29:23.250
to warm things up.
yes. sir.

1728
01:30:27.416 --> 01:30:29.458
It's not bad to be your plan B.

1729
01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:31.541
Really?

1730
01:30:31.750 --> 01:30:32.958
Not bad. right?

1731
01:30:35.291 --> 01:30:36.541
What now?

1732
01:30:36.625 --> 01:30:38.708
Now we need certificates.

1733
01:30:38.791 --> 01:30:41.875
buying tables. chairs. lights.

1734
01:30:41.958 --> 01:30:44.541
and go into a shit ton of debt.

1735
01:30:45.958 --> 01:30:46.916
Well.

1736
01:30:47.875 --> 01:30:49.583
in the meantime... Tiramisu?

1737
01:30:50.416 --> 01:30:51.708
Forever.
