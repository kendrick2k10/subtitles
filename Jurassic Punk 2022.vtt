3
00:00:17.365 --> 00:00:19.497
It's a medium. God damn it.

4
00:00:22.805 --> 00:00:24.502
It ain't gonna fit me.

5
00:00:28.376 --> 00:00:29.725
-Look at that.

6
00:00:30.508 --> 00:00:32.423
Oh. it's exactly--

7
00:00:32.467 --> 00:00:34.382
It's exactly what I have.
but it's a medium.

8
00:00:34.425 --> 00:00:36.079
I don't think
it's gonna fit.

9
00:00:36.123 --> 00:00:38.212
-You need a large?
-Yeah. minimum.

10
00:00:41.128 --> 00:00:43.260
I can't wear a shirt
unless it has a stain on it.

11
00:00:43.304 --> 00:00:45.610
If you wear a shirt that
doesn't have a stain on it.

12
00:00:45.654 --> 00:00:46.742
it's not a shirt.

13
00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:52.313
One of the biggest problems
I have is my memory.

14
00:00:54.706 --> 00:00:56.317
I just wanna forget everything.

15
00:00:58.275 --> 00:00:59.450
Unfortunately. I can't.

16
00:01:01.583 --> 00:01:03.541
-You raised her--
-The past haunts me.

17
00:01:05.848 --> 00:01:08.416
Do these animals
deserve the same protections

18
00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:11.288
given to other species?

19
00:01:11.332 --> 00:01:13.508
Or should they just
be left to die?

20
00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.340
These creatures
were here before us.

21
00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.649
I guess Netflix
is doing the thing on Jurassic.

22
00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:28.349
They want to hear
the real story.

23
00:01:29.741 --> 00:01:31.917
Not a revisionist history
version.

24
00:01:34.355 --> 00:01:36.096
We're in "C" Theater

25
00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:39.838
at 3210 Kerner Boulevard.
San Rafael. California.

26
00:01:39.882 --> 00:01:41.318
the old ILM facility.

27
00:01:42.798 --> 00:01:44.365
In this theater
is where we projected

28
00:01:44.408 --> 00:01:46.323
every single one of the shots

29
00:01:46.367 --> 00:01:47.977
that we knew was gonna change
the entire film industry.

30
00:01:53.765 --> 00:01:57.160
When the T-Rex took a step.
you had a secondary jiggle.

31
00:01:57.204 --> 00:01:59.336
So. I had separate channels
of animation

32
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.295
of literally
a digital bladder

33
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.514
hung off
the hierarchy of the leg.

34
00:02:03.558 --> 00:02:05.386
so it shook on the bone.

35
00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.083
So. if the bladder shook.

36
00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:09.607
the outside control vertices
shook as well.

37
00:02:09.651 --> 00:02:11.261
So. every time
the Rex took a step.

38
00:02:11.305 --> 00:02:13.307
you had to have
a massive amount of shake

39
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.004
of this muscle.

40
00:02:15.047 --> 00:02:16.527
A lot of people
are always referring back to it

41
00:02:16.571 --> 00:02:18.616
being the best
of all the Jurassics.

42
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.922
And now. what is it?

43
00:02:19.965 --> 00:02:21.750
World domination
of everything--

44
00:02:21.793 --> 00:02:23.882
I mean the "Giganotosaurus".
that's the latest one.

45
00:02:23.926 --> 00:02:25.710
It was like three times
the size of the Rex.

46
00:02:25.754 --> 00:02:28.017
"It is?
Oh. I better go see the sequel."

47
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.715
Why don't they just merge
Star Wars and Jurassic
together

48
00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:32.761
and come up
with one big mega movie?

49
00:02:32.804 --> 00:02:34.632
You know.
it's like dinosaurs in space

50
00:02:34.676 --> 00:02:36.286
and everyone's shooting
each other. you know?

51
00:02:42.684 --> 00:02:44.555
I'm naive. I guess.

52
00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:45.948
when it comes
to a lot of stuff.

53
00:02:48.472 --> 00:02:50.170
And you get burned. y'know.

54
00:02:52.302 --> 00:02:53.390
You get burned.

55
00:02:57.133 --> 00:02:59.179
Things are so simple now.
right?

56
00:03:01.877 --> 00:03:03.400
Looking back
at the ILM days.

57
00:03:03.444 --> 00:03:05.359
it's almost like
it was a weird dream.

58
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.278
Even though I was using
machines as a tool back then.

59
00:03:12.453 --> 00:03:14.281
I myself
was stuck in a machine.

60
00:03:16.108 --> 00:03:18.198
And this whole thing
about blind curiosity.

61
00:03:18.241 --> 00:03:19.677
trying to. A.
prove it yourself.

62
00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:21.375
and B. you know.

63
00:03:21.418 --> 00:03:23.768
prove it to the world.
you can do something.

64
00:03:23.812 --> 00:03:24.900
Little did I know...

65
00:03:26.162 --> 00:03:27.555
y'know. I created a monster.

66
00:03:30.601 --> 00:03:32.603
And joining me now
in the studio

67
00:03:32.647 --> 00:03:34.779
is the chief animator
at Lucasfilm. Steve Williams.

68
00:03:34.823 --> 00:03:37.260
George Lucas' Industrial Light
and Magic Company.

69
00:03:37.304 --> 00:03:39.044
the folks who provided
special effects

70
00:03:39.088 --> 00:03:40.916
for Star Wars.
is going commercial.

71
00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.918
These hummingbirds
are not real.

72
00:03:42.961 --> 00:03:45.703
Animator Steve Williams
sketches out a line drawing

73
00:03:45.747 --> 00:03:47.662
on a computer screen.

74
00:03:47.705 --> 00:03:49.446
It was never
Steve's intention to combine

75
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.709
his classical animation
training with computers.

76
00:03:51.753 --> 00:03:53.842
but now colleagues marvel.

77
00:03:53.885 --> 00:03:56.279
they've never seen anyone
create life so realistically.

78
00:03:56.323 --> 00:03:58.325
It was not biotechnology

79
00:03:58.368 --> 00:04:01.241
that brought the dinosaurs
to life inJurassic Park.

80
00:04:01.284 --> 00:04:03.025
Animator Steve Williams

81
00:04:03.068 --> 00:04:05.288
used a computer
to bring the T-Rex to life.

82
00:04:05.332 --> 00:04:07.290
The Universal Studios picture

83
00:04:07.334 --> 00:04:09.901
could generate as much
as $50 million this weekend.

84
00:04:09.945 --> 00:04:11.686
Other studios
in town will not open

85
00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:13.514
any of their pictures
against it.

86
00:04:13.557 --> 00:04:15.211
Williams
is one of the hottest

87
00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:16.778
computer animators
in Hollywood.

88
00:04:16.821 --> 00:04:18.432
Spreading his message

89
00:04:18.475 --> 00:04:19.694
that computer animation
is about art.

90
00:04:19.737 --> 00:04:21.086
not technology.

91
00:04:24.002 --> 00:04:26.004
I mean. is there anything
that worries you about this?

92
00:04:26.048 --> 00:04:27.963
Oh. yeah.
I-- I think it's pretty--

93
00:04:28.006 --> 00:04:29.921
I-- I don't think
it's a good thing. but it's--

94
00:04:29.965 --> 00:04:31.488
Well. so. you're sort of
like Dr. Frankenstein.

95
00:04:43.021 --> 00:04:45.894
Everybody thinks that
chaos is completely random.

96
00:04:47.504 --> 00:04:49.071
There is no such thing
as random.

97
00:04:50.725 --> 00:04:52.596
Every single variable
is calculatable.

98
00:04:53.728 --> 00:04:55.947
And math
is nothing but a language

99
00:04:55.991 --> 00:04:58.994
to try and describe
what nature already knows.

100
00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:03.955
We're so steeped
in the rules...

101
00:05:05.522 --> 00:05:08.960
so when you think differently.
you're seen as a heretic.

102
00:05:09.004 --> 00:05:14.052
♪

103
00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:24.628
I know I was different.
you know. I-- I knew it.

104
00:05:25.847 --> 00:05:27.065
I've always been different.

105
00:05:29.024 --> 00:05:32.027
I had visions about
how things are gonna be...

106
00:05:33.245 --> 00:05:35.683
and not should be.
but just are going to be.

107
00:05:37.641 --> 00:05:39.774
Especially about.
you know. synthetic imagery.

108
00:05:40.775 --> 00:05:43.168
Here's a low-resolution data
of the T-Rex.

109
00:05:43.212 --> 00:05:44.735
and most of these points here

110
00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:46.607
where each one
of the bones were.

111
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.130
Jurassic Park storyboards.

112
00:05:48.739 --> 00:05:51.742
"SS approved" means
Steven Spielberg approved.

113
00:05:51.786 --> 00:05:53.614
Chase scene four.

114
00:05:53.657 --> 00:05:55.572
75 frames. Took me four months
to animate this shot.

115
00:05:57.748 --> 00:06:00.490
Here's somebody
that was fundamental

116
00:06:00.534 --> 00:06:03.580
at that time.
in-- in. uh. the-- the.

117
00:06:03.624 --> 00:06:07.497
um. progress of this
disruptive technology.

118
00:06:08.063 --> 00:06:10.587
But. the way
that I know him now.

119
00:06:10.631 --> 00:06:12.328
he mainly likes to blacksmith.

120
00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:13.982
and we end up hanging out
in the shop

121
00:06:14.025 --> 00:06:16.506
because he likes
to get his hands dirty.

122
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.638
just like I do.

123
00:06:18.508 --> 00:06:19.814
We all called him Spaz.

124
00:06:20.292 --> 00:06:22.469
Now. calling
Steve Williams "Spaz."

125
00:06:22.512 --> 00:06:24.645
was. uh. a nickname.

126
00:06:24.688 --> 00:06:27.648
like. that giant guy
in high school

127
00:06:27.691 --> 00:06:29.780
that everybody called Tiny.

128
00:06:29.824 --> 00:06:31.782
Hey. Spaz.
my. how you doing. buddy?

129
00:06:31.826 --> 00:06:35.177
That character
with the pocket protector

130
00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.485
and the thick glasses.
he was the opposite.

131
00:06:39.486 --> 00:06:42.358
Here was a motorcycle-riding.

132
00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:45.317
leather-jacket-wearing guy.

133
00:06:45.361 --> 00:06:47.189
who's the first one
that I ever met.

134
00:06:47.232 --> 00:06:48.320
that was an artist.

135
00:06:48.364 --> 00:06:49.974
who had computer

136
00:06:50.018 --> 00:06:52.412
and high-mathematical skills.

137
00:06:53.369 --> 00:06:57.155
Like Michelangelo took corpses
and dissected them.

138
00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:01.203
Spaz is a guy who kind of
dissected life a little bit.

139
00:07:01.246 --> 00:07:03.379
I was just amazed
by how things worked.

140
00:07:03.988 --> 00:07:05.773
My whole life I was driven by
how things work.

141
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.429
Cartoons deviated
from the rules

142
00:07:09.472 --> 00:07:11.039
of the way nature operates.

143
00:07:11.605 --> 00:07:13.650
It was sort of
questioning convention.

144
00:07:14.303 --> 00:07:16.784
-You're questioning reality.

145
00:07:16.827 --> 00:07:18.612
Good he's got that
going for me.

146
00:07:18.655 --> 00:07:20.135
Got that going at me.

147
00:07:20.178 --> 00:07:21.441
Sheridan College
in Toronto.

148
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.660
All of us are misfits.

149
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.446
We didn't think
conventionally.

150
00:07:26.489 --> 00:07:28.404
We're these. like.
these strange artists.

151
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.407
I decided to take
classical animation.

152
00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:33.409
Then. I took
computer engineering.

153
00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:35.019
University of Toronto.

154
00:07:35.063 --> 00:07:37.326
Then I joined a company
in Toronto called Alias.

155
00:07:37.369 --> 00:07:39.676
using computers
to do animation.

156
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.504
No one really thought about it
that way.

157
00:07:42.113 --> 00:07:43.550
They thought it
for data processing.

158
00:07:43.593 --> 00:07:44.681
they didn't really
think about it

159
00:07:44.725 --> 00:07:45.900
for actually animating.

160
00:07:46.596 --> 00:07:48.816
I was attempting to try
and replicate the real world

161
00:07:48.859 --> 00:07:50.295
in a synthetic environment.

162
00:07:51.122 --> 00:07:53.211
There were very few people
in the world that knew Alias.

163
00:07:53.255 --> 00:07:55.910
three-dimensional
computer graphics back in 1988.

164
00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.652
I was working on a system
called the "CIWS."

165
00:07:58.695 --> 00:08:00.828
it was a Gatling gun that.
for the most part.

166
00:08:00.871 --> 00:08:02.743
sat on Iowa-class
battleships.

167
00:08:03.744 --> 00:08:05.180
The simulation
I was working.

168
00:08:05.223 --> 00:08:06.964
had the fluorocarbon
cooling system.

169
00:08:07.748 --> 00:08:09.793
ILM.
Industrial Light Magic.

170
00:08:09.837 --> 00:08:11.621
got wind
that there was somebody

171
00:08:11.665 --> 00:08:13.231
that actually knew something
about fluid dynamics.

172
00:08:14.319 --> 00:08:15.973
They're working on a movie

173
00:08:16.017 --> 00:08:18.280
where there's a water creature.

174
00:08:18.323 --> 00:08:20.108
Now. you see
water doing things

175
00:08:20.151 --> 00:08:22.502
all the time.
but back in the day.

176
00:08:22.545 --> 00:08:24.547
you said. "Well. it's gonna be
water that comes alive.

177
00:08:24.591 --> 00:08:26.418
and then the face
comes out of the water."

178
00:08:27.245 --> 00:08:28.508
People would just blank out.

179
00:08:29.726 --> 00:08:32.381
It was a big question mark
for everybody.

180
00:08:32.424 --> 00:08:34.426
What Jim had seen
in computer graphics

181
00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:35.819
up to that point.

182
00:08:35.863 --> 00:08:37.299
was all the other
prior films

183
00:08:37.342 --> 00:08:38.909
that had used
computer graphics.

184
00:08:38.953 --> 00:08:40.563
like Last Starfighter.
and Tron.

185
00:08:40.607 --> 00:08:42.304
and even
Young Sherlock Holmes.

186
00:08:43.087 --> 00:08:45.263
CG had
an artificiality to it.

187
00:08:46.351 --> 00:08:49.659
We were looking
for a photo-real thing.

188
00:08:49.703 --> 00:08:52.096
His previous films.
Terminatorand Aliens.

189
00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.925
they were about
thrills and action.

190
00:08:56.797 --> 00:09:00.278
They were not about just
a straight sense of wonder.

191
00:09:01.323 --> 00:09:03.368
He really wanted to
show that he could do that.

192
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.459
We clearly needed
additional talent

193
00:09:07.503 --> 00:09:10.027
and we found
Steve Williams.

194
00:09:11.376 --> 00:09:14.118
The quality was paramount.

195
00:09:14.162 --> 00:09:15.772
If we were gonna be successful.

196
00:09:15.816 --> 00:09:18.079
this stuff had to be
not just good enough.

197
00:09:18.122 --> 00:09:20.429
it had to be great.
it had to be convincing.

198
00:09:20.472 --> 00:09:22.039
it had to be something

199
00:09:22.083 --> 00:09:25.216
that ultimately
no one had ever seen before.

200
00:09:26.696 --> 00:09:28.480
So I ended up
at Industrial Light Magic.

201
00:09:28.524 --> 00:09:31.614
and I got hired
in October of 1988

202
00:09:31.658 --> 00:09:33.529
to be Chief Animator
on The Abyss.

203
00:09:34.878 --> 00:09:36.358
We had two machines.

204
00:09:36.401 --> 00:09:39.187
Silicon Graphics GT60
and a GT80.

205
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.276
The first thing I had to do

206
00:09:41.319 --> 00:09:43.670
was figure out
how to animate the spine

207
00:09:43.713 --> 00:09:44.801
of the pseudopod.

208
00:09:45.672 --> 00:09:47.282
"The Water Weenie"
was the nickname.

209
00:09:48.239 --> 00:09:49.414
Everyone's looking at us.

210
00:09:50.154 --> 00:09:51.721
If we fail.

211
00:09:51.765 --> 00:09:53.070
it would have been
a tremendous setback.

212
00:09:55.116 --> 00:09:57.379
I was the first Ph.D.
at ILM

213
00:09:57.422 --> 00:09:59.120
in the subject
of computer graphics.

214
00:10:00.077 --> 00:10:01.731
We didn't have
a lot office space.

215
00:10:01.775 --> 00:10:03.864
but I got put in this thing
called "The Pit."

216
00:10:04.995 --> 00:10:06.867
which was downstairs
and was a sound room.

217
00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:09.565
And we turned it into this
kind of wild. wacky office.

218
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.612
Spaz was put down there too.

219
00:10:13.874 --> 00:10:16.485
My first impression.
he walks in.

220
00:10:16.528 --> 00:10:19.009
he's got. like.
a tight. white t-shirt.

221
00:10:19.053 --> 00:10:20.924
crew cut.
Dudley Do-Right chin.

222
00:10:20.968 --> 00:10:22.622
old school jeans
rolled up at the bottom.

223
00:10:22.665 --> 00:10:23.797
and wearing engineer boots.

224
00:10:24.449 --> 00:10:27.452
It-- it's. like.
a '50s biker thing

225
00:10:27.496 --> 00:10:29.498
or. you know.
this kind of strange.

226
00:10:29.541 --> 00:10:31.326
macho Canadian thing
or who knows what.

227
00:10:31.369 --> 00:10:33.110
There's this fucking
hippie and I'm thinking.

228
00:10:33.154 --> 00:10:34.721
"Ah. God damned fucking hippie.

229
00:10:34.764 --> 00:10:37.462
God damned Californian."
you know?

230
00:10:37.506 --> 00:10:38.812
And he's got his feet
on the desk

231
00:10:38.855 --> 00:10:40.814
and playing on the stereo

232
00:10:40.857 --> 00:10:43.120
Alice Cooper.
"Love it to Death."

233
00:10:43.164 --> 00:10:46.733
That's the first fucking
album I ever had and he goes.

234
00:10:46.776 --> 00:10:48.299
"That's the first album
I ever had."

235
00:10:48.343 --> 00:10:50.084
And that was it. Game over.

236
00:10:50.693 --> 00:10:52.477
We hit it off right away.

237
00:10:52.521 --> 00:10:54.131
I mean. it's funny. even though
we're very different.

238
00:10:54.175 --> 00:10:55.480
we like to have fun.

239
00:10:56.264 --> 00:10:58.527
Have fun. be fun.
That was our motto.

240
00:10:59.397 --> 00:11:01.138
We were outsiders.

241
00:11:01.182 --> 00:11:04.098
only because we had this
technical animation solution.

242
00:11:04.141 --> 00:11:05.708
but we hadn't really worked
on films.

243
00:11:06.622 --> 00:11:08.493
My job. you know.

244
00:11:08.537 --> 00:11:10.234
was to try and figure out
the nuance of the animation.

245
00:11:11.453 --> 00:11:13.542
Mark had come up
with this code

246
00:11:13.585 --> 00:11:15.762
that allowed us to put
little sine wave distributions

247
00:11:15.805 --> 00:11:17.546
over the surface
to create a rippling effect.

248
00:11:18.286 --> 00:11:20.288
How to take surfaces
and make them undulate

249
00:11:20.331 --> 00:11:21.942
like they're water.
even though they're tubes.

250
00:11:21.985 --> 00:11:23.683
that was a big pain in the ass.

251
00:11:24.205 --> 00:11:26.120
We had to just find solutions.

252
00:11:26.729 --> 00:11:29.123
Jim sent us back scans

253
00:11:29.166 --> 00:11:31.038
with the video we had

254
00:11:31.081 --> 00:11:33.649
just drawing on it
with a marker. he faxed them.

255
00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:36.260
Ultimately.
we were able to accomplish

256
00:11:36.304 --> 00:11:37.914
what Jim was looking for.

257
00:11:38.654 --> 00:11:40.961
Cameron had said.
had that scene failed.

258
00:11:41.004 --> 00:11:42.919
he would've just yanked it
from the entire film.

259
00:11:43.615 --> 00:11:45.400
But it ended being
one of the premiere scenes.

260
00:11:45.879 --> 00:11:47.054
Everybody looked at it
and went.

261
00:11:47.097 --> 00:11:48.708
"How in blazes was that done?"

262
00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.710
And that's
where the deal changed.

263
00:11:53.364 --> 00:11:56.019
I knew darn well
this would be the best

264
00:11:56.063 --> 00:11:57.542
that I would ever do.

265
00:11:57.586 --> 00:11:58.630
Ever.

266
00:11:59.893 --> 00:12:01.416
I just knew
that there wasn't gonna be

267
00:12:01.459 --> 00:12:03.331
any more creative hurdles.

268
00:12:03.374 --> 00:12:05.725
there wouldn't be anything
like what we were doing at ILM.

269
00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:10.904
When you grow up in Canada.
it's like...

270
00:12:12.644 --> 00:12:15.299
you grow up
with eight colors. okay?

271
00:12:16.431 --> 00:12:19.477
So. you have to learn
how to design and draw.

272
00:12:19.521 --> 00:12:20.914
and paint
with these eight colors.

273
00:12:20.957 --> 00:12:22.567
When you come to the States.

274
00:12:22.611 --> 00:12:24.308
you're instantly.
across the border.

275
00:12:24.352 --> 00:12:25.788
given 20 colors.

276
00:12:32.012 --> 00:12:33.796
It blows your bloody mind.

277
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.799
You can have a '65 Cadillac
without any rust on it.

278
00:12:36.843 --> 00:12:39.236
Engines. gas.

279
00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.718
bullets. beer. everything.
just like that. snap.

280
00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:44.372
Everything's
a half an hour away.

281
00:12:44.415 --> 00:12:46.374
It's great.
It's like being in Disneyland.

282
00:12:47.592 --> 00:12:50.117
One. one gun.
ah. ah. ah. ah.

283
00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:55.644
In America.
anybody can do anything.

284
00:12:56.297 --> 00:12:58.734
All you have to do
is put in the dedication

285
00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:00.301
and the sweat.

286
00:13:00.344 --> 00:13:01.563
and you can get
whatever you fucking want.

287
00:13:02.956 --> 00:13:04.827
That concept
didn't exist in Canada.

288
00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.699
Growing up in Toronto.

289
00:13:09.397 --> 00:13:11.007
you're growing up
in suppression.

290
00:13:12.052 --> 00:13:13.967
You're growing up
in bureaucracy.

291
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:17.144
You are not qualified
to do this.

292
00:13:18.493 --> 00:13:19.799
The prime minister
at the time

293
00:13:19.842 --> 00:13:21.017
was a guy named
Pierre Trudeau.

294
00:13:21.583 --> 00:13:23.063
And Pierre Trudeau said.

295
00:13:23.106 --> 00:13:24.151
"If you don't like it here
in Canada.

296
00:13:24.194 --> 00:13:25.630
move somewhere else."

297
00:13:25.674 --> 00:13:27.589
So. I said.
"Okay. fine. I'm gonna."

298
00:13:28.111 --> 00:13:29.199
And I did.

299
00:13:31.462 --> 00:13:33.334
So. this is
the original mousepad

300
00:13:33.377 --> 00:13:36.424
that I used
to build Terminator 2.

301
00:13:37.599 --> 00:13:41.081
I was there so much
I ended up wearing out the pad.

302
00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:43.648
Pretty funny. eh?

303
00:13:46.173 --> 00:13:48.262
The pseudopod sequence
was a validation

304
00:13:48.305 --> 00:13:50.699
that this was a technique
that had a lot of promise.

305
00:13:51.874 --> 00:13:54.572
But it took Jim Cameron
on his next film.

306
00:13:54.616 --> 00:13:57.227
Terminator 2. to kind of
take it to the next step

307
00:13:57.271 --> 00:13:59.229
of what you could do
with it.

308
00:14:04.278 --> 00:14:07.716
The Abyss encouraged me
to take it a step further.

309
00:14:07.759 --> 00:14:09.022
or many steps further.

310
00:14:09.065 --> 00:14:10.980
He knew to try and push it.

311
00:14:11.024 --> 00:14:13.113
And that was the good thing
about Cameron. he pushed it.

312
00:14:13.156 --> 00:14:14.766
He believed in it.

313
00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:16.333
even though he didn't know
the technology

314
00:14:16.377 --> 00:14:18.814
or the technique
and he let myself and Spaz

315
00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:20.468
and everyone run with it.

316
00:14:23.688 --> 00:14:26.474
Everyone's neck
was on the line. including his.

317
00:14:28.084 --> 00:14:30.043
The biggest
technical challenge

318
00:14:30.086 --> 00:14:33.176
was building a human in data.
it hadn't been done before.

319
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.092
Robert Patrick
is the T-1000.

320
00:14:36.136 --> 00:14:37.615
We're gonna study his body.

321
00:14:37.659 --> 00:14:39.269
we're gonna watch
his movements.

322
00:14:39.313 --> 00:14:41.576
we're gonna find a way
to capture his quality.

323
00:14:42.229 --> 00:14:44.057
There was
no motion capture back then.

324
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.146
So. Mark and I thought

325
00:14:46.189 --> 00:14:48.452
"Okay. well. let's do
what Muybridge had done."

326
00:14:48.496 --> 00:14:51.586
Put a grid.
but not on the background.

327
00:14:52.456 --> 00:14:53.588
Put a grid on the guy.

328
00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:56.417
The day I got cast.

329
00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.942
I'm flown
to wherever the hell ILM is.

330
00:15:00.769 --> 00:15:04.773
Spaz and Mark start to paint
these grids over me...

331
00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:08.908
and I had no idea
what the fuck they were doing.

332
00:15:08.951 --> 00:15:11.388
Pardon my language. but.
you know. they're animators.

333
00:15:11.432 --> 00:15:13.086
I don't know
what they're doing. but they--

334
00:15:13.129 --> 00:15:14.826
they seem real interested
in what I'm doing.

335
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.177
All right.
oh. man. oh. man.

336
00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:19.614
-I'm one of the biggest--
-No. no. you're not.

337
00:15:19.657 --> 00:15:21.877
Yes. I am.
I could have been a T-1000.

338
00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:24.184
You can only pray
to have lines like that.

339
00:15:24.227 --> 00:15:26.012
I think
that's the only time

340
00:15:26.055 --> 00:15:27.665
I ever seen you with a smile.
Robert. huh?

341
00:15:27.709 --> 00:15:29.972
He's out of character.

342
00:15:30.016 --> 00:15:33.149
Mark and Steve
were so inquisitive

343
00:15:33.193 --> 00:15:34.977
about what was I thinking.

344
00:15:35.021 --> 00:15:37.197
where was I getting
these ideas?

345
00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.894
If you're my target now.

346
00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:40.940
my left leg and my hip
would drop back.

347
00:15:40.983 --> 00:15:43.246
my hip would lead me.
and then the target's there.

348
00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:44.987
Gotcha.

349
00:15:45.031 --> 00:15:45.901
Immediately.
it clicked with that.

350
00:15:46.597 --> 00:15:48.556
We had. like.
our own theory.

351
00:15:48.599 --> 00:15:51.428
our own T-1000 talk.
our own jargon.

352
00:15:52.473 --> 00:15:54.736
And they were kinda close
to my age.

353
00:15:54.779 --> 00:15:56.651
And I could tell
they were young and eager.

354
00:15:56.694 --> 00:15:59.697
trying to make a name
for themselves as well.

355
00:16:02.048 --> 00:16:04.746
We were all
pretty passionate.

356
00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:07.183
And I remember thinking.

357
00:16:07.227 --> 00:16:09.098
"T-2 man.
it's a whole 'nother level up."

358
00:16:10.447 --> 00:16:12.058
The walk out of the fire.

359
00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:16.279
the first unveiling
of the special powers

360
00:16:16.323 --> 00:16:17.977
the T-1000 had.

361
00:16:20.588 --> 00:16:22.416
The first take I did.
I went in there

362
00:16:22.459 --> 00:16:24.026
and I could smell
my shirt burning.

363
00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:25.897
And I could feel it
on the back of my ears.

364
00:16:25.941 --> 00:16:27.508
My ears were getting singed.

365
00:16:28.204 --> 00:16:29.553
The first shot I had to do

366
00:16:29.597 --> 00:16:31.381
was CC1
walking out of the fire.

367
00:16:31.425 --> 00:16:33.296
There was 375 frames long.

368
00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.472
fully skin walking T-1000.

369
00:16:36.125 --> 00:16:37.735
I remember shooting that.

370
00:16:37.779 --> 00:16:39.259
and I remember
everybody being frustrated.

371
00:16:39.302 --> 00:16:41.261
I remember me
being very frustrated.

372
00:16:41.304 --> 00:16:43.002
because I thought
I was fucking it up

373
00:16:43.045 --> 00:16:44.960
for everybody.

374
00:16:45.004 --> 00:16:47.049
I think we did like 27 takes
or something. I don't know.

375
00:16:47.919 --> 00:16:49.530
I do remember that day.

376
00:16:49.573 --> 00:16:52.489
Jim and I sitting somewhere
in that canal.

377
00:16:52.533 --> 00:16:53.925
off to the side
in the shade.

378
00:16:54.709 --> 00:16:57.016
I think he could sense
at how frustrated I was

379
00:16:58.321 --> 00:17:02.195
and he said. "Hey. man.
this has never been done.

380
00:17:03.761 --> 00:17:05.198
We're making movie history.

381
00:17:06.982 --> 00:17:08.418
This is history right now."

382
00:17:10.464 --> 00:17:11.900
At ILM.

383
00:17:11.943 --> 00:17:13.119
we shot all this
great reference material

384
00:17:13.162 --> 00:17:14.294
of Robert Patrick walking.

385
00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:17.993
I'd come up with a method
to actually build the T-1000.

386
00:17:18.472 --> 00:17:19.690
Okay. ready to roll camera?

387
00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:22.302
All right.
roll "B" camera.

388
00:17:22.345 --> 00:17:23.433
Action!

389
00:17:24.565 --> 00:17:26.219
I started with a set of bones.

390
00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:31.050
Spaz. he actually
animated my skeletal system.

391
00:17:34.096 --> 00:17:36.098
So it operates
like any standard puppet.

392
00:17:36.142 --> 00:17:37.752
it's got 30 channels to it

393
00:17:37.795 --> 00:17:39.623
that go from anywhere
from controlling

394
00:17:39.667 --> 00:17:41.451
the speed of his legs

395
00:17:41.495 --> 00:17:43.236
to the speed
of what his fingers are doing.

396
00:17:43.279 --> 00:17:44.933
This is really
the first successful step

397
00:17:44.976 --> 00:17:46.804
to adding real life

398
00:17:46.848 --> 00:17:49.416
to an otherwise inanimate
piece of geometry.

399
00:17:49.459 --> 00:17:51.418
We are destined to do that
or nothing.

400
00:17:51.461 --> 00:17:53.811
We knew that other people
had come so far.

401
00:17:53.855 --> 00:17:55.683
we wanted to go beyond that.

402
00:17:56.945 --> 00:17:58.425
Once that shot happened.
that was it.

403
00:17:59.469 --> 00:18:00.557
Everybody knew.

404
00:18:02.429 --> 00:18:03.865
That was a new beginning.

405
00:18:05.649 --> 00:18:06.998
ILM was evolving.

406
00:18:08.391 --> 00:18:12.613
If you're lucky.
you will find a place to go

407
00:18:12.656 --> 00:18:15.746
where they will continue
to subsidize your insanity.

408
00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:18.488
Stories that wanted to be told
ten years ago

409
00:18:18.532 --> 00:18:20.490
couldn't really be told

410
00:18:20.534 --> 00:18:22.449
because there was limitations
in the effects industry.

411
00:18:22.492 --> 00:18:24.407
You know. so...

412
00:18:24.451 --> 00:18:26.583
Every time we did something
that became better and digital.

413
00:18:26.627 --> 00:18:29.369
more experts moved in.
that we'd never seen before.

414
00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:31.675
More managers moved in.

415
00:18:32.633 --> 00:18:34.591
More people to tell you
what you were doing wrong.

416
00:18:34.635 --> 00:18:35.723
even though
they didn't even understand

417
00:18:35.766 --> 00:18:36.854
what you were doing.

418
00:18:37.551 --> 00:18:39.857
Many folks.
particularly in the beginning.

419
00:18:39.901 --> 00:18:42.599
didn't embrace it.
nor did they feel. like.

420
00:18:42.643 --> 00:18:45.167
they had the capability
to embrace it.

421
00:18:45.863 --> 00:18:47.691
You didn't want
to lose your job

422
00:18:47.735 --> 00:18:49.302
to anything that was new.

423
00:18:50.085 --> 00:18:52.435
Right away. we knew.
"This is coming."

424
00:18:53.044 --> 00:18:54.785
A lot of people
were terrified by it.

425
00:18:54.829 --> 00:18:56.744
"It's gonna put model makers
out of work."

426
00:18:56.787 --> 00:18:58.789
It was a live conversation
happening all the time

427
00:18:58.833 --> 00:18:59.834
'cause it was a threat.

428
00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:02.184
That's how we saw it.

429
00:19:02.228 --> 00:19:04.839
So not only did they not want
to embrace them.

430
00:19:04.882 --> 00:19:06.928
they actually
wanted to see them fail.

431
00:19:06.971 --> 00:19:08.147
in my opinion.

432
00:19:09.583 --> 00:19:11.498
But. this was the future.

433
00:19:11.541 --> 00:19:13.282
And I just started
buying gear.

434
00:19:13.326 --> 00:19:15.154
Throwing money into digital.

435
00:19:15.763 --> 00:19:17.591
Now. we started hiring.

436
00:19:17.634 --> 00:19:20.811
And we needed to hire people
to do Terminator 2.

437
00:19:20.855 --> 00:19:22.465
On The Abyss.

438
00:19:22.509 --> 00:19:24.250
there were probably
seven or eight. um.

439
00:19:24.293 --> 00:19:25.947
computer graphics artists.

440
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:27.514
And by the time
we got to Terminator

441
00:19:27.557 --> 00:19:29.994
it had grown to around 15.

442
00:19:31.039 --> 00:19:33.084
We were kind of new
to this whole field.

443
00:19:33.128 --> 00:19:35.217
We were inventing
it as we went along.

444
00:19:36.131 --> 00:19:38.481
I went into ILM
my first day.

445
00:19:38.525 --> 00:19:41.441
and they crack open a binder
full of storyboards.

446
00:19:41.484 --> 00:19:43.182
and I'm turning
through the pages

447
00:19:43.225 --> 00:19:44.705
and looking at one thing
and saying.

448
00:19:44.748 --> 00:19:46.881
"Oh. well.
how are we gonna do that?"

449
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.362
And they said.
"Oh. we don't know yet."

450
00:19:50.101 --> 00:19:52.016
I turn a few more pages
and look at something else

451
00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:53.583
and.
"Oh. how do we do that?"

452
00:19:54.323 --> 00:19:55.803
"We don't know."

453
00:19:55.846 --> 00:19:57.848
And I thought.
"You people are crazy."

454
00:19:58.849 --> 00:20:01.069
What I knew
was geometry and animation.

455
00:20:01.112 --> 00:20:02.679
and a little bit
about lighting.

456
00:20:02.723 --> 00:20:04.290
I didn't know anything
about compositing.

457
00:20:04.333 --> 00:20:05.726
I certainly
didn't know anything

458
00:20:05.769 --> 00:20:07.336
about traditional
special effects.

459
00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:08.685
I wasn't even
a big movie buff. really.

460
00:20:09.469 --> 00:20:12.689
I had no training
in film whatsoever.

461
00:20:13.299 --> 00:20:14.822
Not a single day
of film school.

462
00:20:15.518 --> 00:20:18.478
Every filmmaker who wanted
to do something new.

463
00:20:18.521 --> 00:20:19.696
came to ILM.

464
00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:22.264
But. doing traditional effects.

465
00:20:22.308 --> 00:20:24.353
blowing things up
in camera.

466
00:20:24.397 --> 00:20:26.225
and then optically
printing them

467
00:20:26.268 --> 00:20:28.488
was very much
still the norm back then.

468
00:20:29.053 --> 00:20:30.707
As the manager of the company.

469
00:20:30.751 --> 00:20:32.927
what I really needed to do
is foster change.

470
00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:35.669
so I needed to take some of
the computer graphics people

471
00:20:35.712 --> 00:20:38.585
and put them in
with the old school masters.

472
00:20:39.194 --> 00:20:41.501
And I carved out.
like. a week of time

473
00:20:41.544 --> 00:20:43.894
of these people
to be together in a seminar

474
00:20:43.938 --> 00:20:45.505
so that
they could teach each other.

475
00:20:49.683 --> 00:20:53.208
It was like oil and water.

476
00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:55.732
And this is. uh.
C-3PO. huh. you know.

477
00:20:56.255 --> 00:20:58.169
The computer graphics people

478
00:20:58.213 --> 00:21:00.955
that were being hired
had very little time.

479
00:21:00.998 --> 00:21:03.827
nor interest.
in old school technology.

480
00:21:03.871 --> 00:21:06.047
And let's see how
his vital signs are.

481
00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:08.005
Well. after all these years
he still holds up.

482
00:21:08.049 --> 00:21:09.398
It was like. you know.

483
00:21:09.442 --> 00:21:11.313
your high school students
saying.

484
00:21:11.357 --> 00:21:12.880
"Why do I have to study math?
I don't need to study.

485
00:21:12.923 --> 00:21:14.534
I have this thing.
it's a calculator."

486
00:21:15.622 --> 00:21:18.755
We all loved ILM
and we loved George Lucas

487
00:21:18.799 --> 00:21:20.279
and we loved all that stuff

488
00:21:20.322 --> 00:21:21.671
'cause it had an impact
on our lives.

489
00:21:21.715 --> 00:21:24.892
But. we weren't.
like. mad fanboys.

490
00:21:24.935 --> 00:21:27.547
We believed in kind of
the irony of it all. you know?

491
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:29.810
So. it wasn't. like.
to be taken so seriously.

492
00:21:29.853 --> 00:21:32.247
it wasn't. like. uh. uh.

493
00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:34.293
we wanted to deify
or worship all these things.

494
00:21:34.336 --> 00:21:36.164
So. we were-- First of all.
we were casual about it.

495
00:21:37.339 --> 00:21:39.298
Hello. how are you?

496
00:21:39.341 --> 00:21:41.387
My name's Dobbie.
Dobbie Dickwit.

497
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:43.345
Steve Williams
was a combination

498
00:21:43.389 --> 00:21:47.915
of brilliance. naivete.
some childishness.

499
00:21:47.958 --> 00:21:50.744
all wrapped
into one package.

500
00:21:50.787 --> 00:21:52.485
And I think. uh.

501
00:21:52.528 --> 00:21:55.966
some of that rubbed management
the wrong way.

502
00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:57.751
He drove me crazy.

503
00:21:57.794 --> 00:21:59.492
He drove everybody crazy
in that marketing department

504
00:21:59.535 --> 00:22:01.407
'cause he did not do
what we wanted him to do.

505
00:22:01.972 --> 00:22:04.279
And he almost had.
like. a secret glee.

506
00:22:04.323 --> 00:22:06.063
by not doing
what we wanted him to do.

507
00:22:07.543 --> 00:22:09.763
If you're gonna have
a successful company

508
00:22:09.806 --> 00:22:11.504
with creative people in it.

509
00:22:11.547 --> 00:22:15.769
you gotta give some leeway
to these unusual types.

510
00:22:15.812 --> 00:22:19.642
They are young.
full of energy.

511
00:22:19.686 --> 00:22:22.950
and some of them
are oddballs.

512
00:22:22.993 --> 00:22:25.082
Well. hi there.
I am Hickory. I own this farm.

513
00:22:25.126 --> 00:22:26.693
-Nice to meet you.
-Ow!

514
00:22:26.736 --> 00:22:29.260
Let go
you fucking asshole.

515
00:22:30.827 --> 00:22:32.612
There was a lot
of serious work there.

516
00:22:32.655 --> 00:22:34.701
but there was also
a lot of nonsense.

517
00:22:34.744 --> 00:22:36.920
And you have to have
a lot of nonsense

518
00:22:36.964 --> 00:22:40.097
to actually get
creative stuff done.

519
00:22:40.141 --> 00:22:43.100
It's part of the equation.

520
00:22:44.319 --> 00:22:45.973
We would have these parties

521
00:22:46.016 --> 00:22:47.714
called "pit parties."

522
00:22:47.757 --> 00:22:49.498
We hung up fliers
all around the company.

523
00:22:49.542 --> 00:22:52.414
it said. "Nailed. an evening
of social penetration."

524
00:23:00.727 --> 00:23:02.946
We had two big bowls.

525
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:04.818
"Mystic Masonic Punch."

526
00:23:04.861 --> 00:23:06.863
and "Our Lady
of the Berry Wine."

527
00:23:07.908 --> 00:23:10.301
There are people running around
drunk out of their heads.

528
00:23:11.607 --> 00:23:13.479
There's really no guidelines

529
00:23:13.522 --> 00:23:15.263
or no established standards

530
00:23:15.306 --> 00:23:17.091
of how we were supposed
to behave

531
00:23:17.134 --> 00:23:19.354
or what we're supposed to do
or not do.

532
00:23:19.398 --> 00:23:21.530
So. there were certain drugs
were consumed.

533
00:23:21.574 --> 00:23:23.402
and. well.
I took some mushrooms

534
00:23:23.445 --> 00:23:25.447
and watched some black
and white movie in reverse.

535
00:23:26.274 --> 00:23:27.884
The fact
that they were down there

536
00:23:27.928 --> 00:23:29.582
in the pit. they could let off
a lot of steam.

537
00:23:30.234 --> 00:23:32.933
Steve would have a hockey stick
and he'd be bashing something.

538
00:23:33.803 --> 00:23:35.370
I end up falling off the desk

539
00:23:35.414 --> 00:23:36.850
and falling
into a pile of glass.

540
00:23:37.677 --> 00:23:39.069
I didn't have any feeling
for a while.

541
00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:41.724
I was suspended twice.

542
00:23:41.768 --> 00:23:43.465
because we fucking
destroyed the place.

543
00:23:45.815 --> 00:23:47.513
You needed to allow people

544
00:23:47.556 --> 00:23:50.951
to make mistakes
and experiment.

545
00:23:51.821 --> 00:23:54.563
You also needed to allow them
to understand

546
00:23:54.607 --> 00:23:55.956
that it was a business.

547
00:23:57.044 --> 00:23:58.872
There was a lot
of politics at the time

548
00:23:58.915 --> 00:24:00.874
because it was
a high-profile film.

549
00:24:00.917 --> 00:24:02.484
In The Abyss.

550
00:24:02.528 --> 00:24:04.225
you know.
there was a small sequence.

551
00:24:04.268 --> 00:24:05.835
James Cameron
had basically said.

552
00:24:05.879 --> 00:24:08.403
"If this does not get done
on schedule.

553
00:24:08.447 --> 00:24:10.318
I can just cut it out."

554
00:24:10.361 --> 00:24:12.973
Now. for Terminator 2.
it was pretty clear

555
00:24:13.016 --> 00:24:16.063
that if computer graphics
didn't work out.

556
00:24:16.106 --> 00:24:17.194
that would be a problem.

557
00:24:18.021 --> 00:24:19.806
So. the pressure was on.

558
00:24:19.849 --> 00:24:22.373
Somehow. everybody around us
just had to trust us.

559
00:24:23.113 --> 00:24:24.506
If the studio
was about to spend

560
00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:26.508
five or six million dollars.

561
00:24:26.552 --> 00:24:29.076
they want somebody
that's got some cred. right?

562
00:24:29.119 --> 00:24:30.686
Not us young punks.

563
00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:32.862
For a group
of computer graphics people

564
00:24:32.906 --> 00:24:34.647
who are trying
to prove themselves.

565
00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:37.258
you had to have a face for that.
and that was Dennis.

566
00:24:38.607 --> 00:24:41.567
Dennis Muren
looms big over everything.

567
00:24:42.176 --> 00:24:43.612
He is Optimus Prime.

568
00:24:44.395 --> 00:24:45.832
Dennis had all the experience

569
00:24:45.875 --> 00:24:47.834
and such great credentials.

570
00:24:47.877 --> 00:24:49.531
He was the leader
of the pack.

571
00:24:49.575 --> 00:24:51.533
He was the guy
with the most gold statues.

572
00:24:51.577 --> 00:24:53.317
he was the guy that was still
standing in there the longest.

573
00:24:53.361 --> 00:24:55.276
He was the guy.

574
00:24:55.319 --> 00:24:57.452
Computer generated images
are a way of coming up

575
00:24:57.496 --> 00:24:58.888
with new effects.

576
00:24:58.932 --> 00:25:00.673
You're starting to see.
I think.

577
00:25:00.716 --> 00:25:03.197
a lot of the limits
of traditional effects.

578
00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.546
So. I've all the time.

579
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:05.895
been sort of pushing
for this stuff to work.

580
00:25:06.635 --> 00:25:08.507
Dennis not only supported

581
00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:11.553
digital technology.
but embraced it and pressed it.

582
00:25:12.119 --> 00:25:14.556
He always.
I think. is looking big picture

583
00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.645
and understands
how all the elements fit.

584
00:25:17.341 --> 00:25:19.430
He could look at an image.
"It's not working."

585
00:25:19.474 --> 00:25:20.780
He's the kind of guy
that could say

586
00:25:20.823 --> 00:25:22.303
what'll make it work.

587
00:25:22.346 --> 00:25:23.783
And that's a big. big talent.

588
00:25:24.958 --> 00:25:26.437
He's one of the best.

589
00:25:26.481 --> 00:25:28.091
That's why
he's so well respected

590
00:25:28.135 --> 00:25:29.223
and won so many awards.

591
00:25:30.616 --> 00:25:33.314
He had the vision
to see where it could go.

592
00:25:33.357 --> 00:25:37.057
but the specifics
of making it go there.

593
00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:38.928
as far as the actual doing.

594
00:25:38.972 --> 00:25:40.713
fell. somewhat.
to other people.

595
00:25:41.583 --> 00:25:43.454
You know. hierarchies
being what they are.

596
00:25:43.498 --> 00:25:47.328
at some point you find yourself
now reporting to someone

597
00:25:47.371 --> 00:25:48.808
who knows less than you do

598
00:25:48.851 --> 00:25:51.027
about what it is
that you're doing.

599
00:25:51.854 --> 00:25:54.596
Dennis comes
from a camera background.

600
00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.467
He knows that area really well.

601
00:25:56.511 --> 00:25:59.514
but he was relying.
certainly. on us computer geeks

602
00:25:59.558 --> 00:26:01.516
to try
and bolt everything together

603
00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.735
and get the shots through.

604
00:26:03.649 --> 00:26:06.739
There's no one person
who can know or do everything

605
00:26:06.782 --> 00:26:10.569
and. so. you have to rely
on people who have expertise.

606
00:26:10.612 --> 00:26:14.007
If you're smart.
you get into that organization.

607
00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:17.097
you play by the rules.
you make connections.

608
00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:19.882
but you have to have
a bit of humility.

609
00:26:20.883 --> 00:26:23.930
The Spaz-Dippé
personality style

610
00:26:23.973 --> 00:26:25.279
I don't think fit.

611
00:26:26.367 --> 00:26:28.325
They had
more of a punk sensibility.

612
00:26:28.978 --> 00:26:30.371
The way they liked to dress

613
00:26:30.414 --> 00:26:32.242
and the way
they liked to do things

614
00:26:32.286 --> 00:26:35.028
was not the norm at ILM.

615
00:26:35.071 --> 00:26:37.421
There were several times
when they almost got fired

616
00:26:37.465 --> 00:26:39.859
During the making
of Terminator 2

617
00:26:39.902 --> 00:26:41.991
there was a dinner.

618
00:26:42.513 --> 00:26:44.080
And it's at Skywalker Ranch.

619
00:26:44.559 --> 00:26:45.952
The ranch was sort of verboten.

620
00:26:46.517 --> 00:26:49.346
We were sort of.
like. the bastard step-children

621
00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:51.610
that lived on Kerner
and ate at Foodles.

622
00:26:52.654 --> 00:26:55.178
Mark and I
are invited to the ranch.

623
00:26:56.092 --> 00:26:58.617
We ride our motorcycles
up Skywalker Ranch.

624
00:26:59.226 --> 00:27:01.402
We park them on the front.
like. 25 motorcycles.

625
00:27:02.011 --> 00:27:04.579
This office building
is a house.

626
00:27:04.623 --> 00:27:06.886
We went
into the executive dining room.

627
00:27:06.929 --> 00:27:09.149
The food's being served.
These two guys get bored

628
00:27:09.192 --> 00:27:11.107
and they decide
to get up and take a walk.

629
00:27:11.151 --> 00:27:12.848
We're just walkin'
around the house.

630
00:27:12.892 --> 00:27:15.329
And then at the very end.
there's a little. like.

631
00:27:15.372 --> 00:27:17.113
sunken den.

632
00:27:17.157 --> 00:27:19.942
They found their way
to George's private sanctum.

633
00:27:19.986 --> 00:27:22.510
the anteroom
to his actual office.

634
00:27:22.553 --> 00:27:24.555
And they walk into the office
and they sit down--

635
00:27:24.599 --> 00:27:27.950
Smoking cigars.
into George's liquor cabinet.

636
00:27:27.994 --> 00:27:29.822
feet up on the desk.

637
00:27:29.865 --> 00:27:33.173
Now. unbeknownst to us.
everything is alarmed.

638
00:27:33.216 --> 00:27:35.001
They have pressure sensitive
carpets up there.

639
00:27:35.044 --> 00:27:36.698
And all of a sudden.
out of nowhere.

640
00:27:36.742 --> 00:27:39.222
the Skywalker police show up.

641
00:27:39.266 --> 00:27:41.747
Skywalker had their own police
and fire department.

642
00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:43.574
"What's going on here?
Who are you?"

643
00:27:43.618 --> 00:27:45.576
"What are you doing?
You're in George Lucas' office."

644
00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:47.448
They had done the unthinkable!

645
00:27:47.491 --> 00:27:51.408
They had actually gone in
and defouled the chambers!

646
00:27:51.452 --> 00:27:53.541
Spaz says.
"Well. my name is Scott Ross."

647
00:27:54.194 --> 00:27:56.718
Dippé gave his name
as Lincoln Hu.

648
00:27:56.762 --> 00:27:58.807
which caused
a certain amount of chagrin

649
00:27:58.851 --> 00:28:00.591
for the real Lincoln Hu.

650
00:28:00.635 --> 00:28:02.376
Lincoln Hu's one of
the only other Asian guys

651
00:28:02.419 --> 00:28:03.769
I can think of. even though
I'm only half Asian.

652
00:28:03.812 --> 00:28:05.553
And the security guy said.

653
00:28:05.596 --> 00:28:07.555
"We know who Scott Ross is.
What's your name?"

654
00:28:07.598 --> 00:28:10.950
And Spaz says. "You got me.
my name's Ed Jones."

655
00:28:11.515 --> 00:28:13.517
So. the next morning
the call comes in.

656
00:28:13.561 --> 00:28:15.258
"What the hell
did you guys do?"

657
00:28:15.302 --> 00:28:16.869
"We didn't do anything.
we were screwing around!"

658
00:28:16.912 --> 00:28:18.174
"Well. they think
you did something

659
00:28:18.218 --> 00:28:19.785
and you're in deep shit."

660
00:28:19.828 --> 00:28:21.612
I go. "Like what?"
"They want you fired."

661
00:28:21.656 --> 00:28:22.701
"What?"

662
00:28:23.223 --> 00:28:24.920
Doug Norby.

663
00:28:24.964 --> 00:28:26.879
Doug Norby was the head
of Lucas Film at the time.

664
00:28:26.922 --> 00:28:28.358
My arch nemesis.

665
00:28:28.402 --> 00:28:30.143
He calls me on the phone
and he says.

666
00:28:30.186 --> 00:28:33.146
"George is beside himself
and I want you to fire

667
00:28:33.189 --> 00:28:35.148
Lincoln Hu and Ed Jones."

668
00:28:35.191 --> 00:28:36.932
I said. "Well. first of all.
it wasn't Lincoln Hu

669
00:28:36.976 --> 00:28:38.629
and it wasn't Ed Jones.

670
00:28:38.673 --> 00:28:41.023
it was Steve Williams
and it was Mark Dippé."

671
00:28:41.067 --> 00:28:43.112
He says.
"George wants them fired."

672
00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.419
I said.
"I can't fire them."

673
00:28:46.115 --> 00:28:47.551
"Listen.
this is what George wants.

674
00:28:47.595 --> 00:28:49.553
-he wants them fired."
-Okay.

675
00:28:49.597 --> 00:28:50.903
Let me just put you
in the picture.

676
00:28:51.381 --> 00:28:53.470
If I fire these two guys.

677
00:28:53.514 --> 00:28:55.168
Jim Cameron

678
00:28:55.211 --> 00:28:58.693
and the entire
Columbia Legal Department

679
00:28:58.737 --> 00:29:01.043
is gonna be in your office
tomorrow

680
00:29:01.087 --> 00:29:04.568
because these two guys
are what makes Terminator 2.

681
00:29:05.613 --> 00:29:08.834
And if I fire the two of them.
the film doesn't get done

682
00:29:08.877 --> 00:29:10.313
and you're gonna be sued.

683
00:29:11.532 --> 00:29:13.099
"Okay.
let me get back to you."

684
00:29:13.142 --> 00:29:15.231
-"Thanks. Doug." Click.
-Damn it! You know?

685
00:29:15.754 --> 00:29:18.321
So. what they had to do
is they had to figure out

686
00:29:18.365 --> 00:29:19.845
how to penalize us.

687
00:29:19.888 --> 00:29:20.802
So. what happened
was we had to sit

688
00:29:20.846 --> 00:29:21.934
on a tribunal.

689
00:29:21.977 --> 00:29:23.500
Me and Mark on one side

690
00:29:23.544 --> 00:29:25.764
and all the head brass
of Lucas Film.

691
00:29:26.373 --> 00:29:28.505
They're asking us
the weirdest fucking questions

692
00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:30.116
in the world.
they're going.

693
00:29:30.159 --> 00:29:31.900
"If you're having a party
at your house.

694
00:29:31.944 --> 00:29:34.598
and you see that people
have gone into your bedroom

695
00:29:34.642 --> 00:29:36.296
during the party.
would you be offended?"

696
00:29:36.339 --> 00:29:38.167
I said. "No!
Are you kidding me?"

697
00:29:38.211 --> 00:29:39.516
They're-- I said.
"At my parties.

698
00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:40.822
everyone's in the bedroom!"

699
00:29:41.344 --> 00:29:44.695
This-- We-- we-- we--
This is ridiculous.

700
00:29:44.739 --> 00:29:46.959
Mark and I go.
"Look. we'll quit right now."

701
00:29:47.002 --> 00:29:49.570
We said we'll quit.
"Oh. no. no. no."

702
00:29:49.613 --> 00:29:51.180
"They can stay.

703
00:29:51.224 --> 00:29:53.704
but they are banned
from the ranch.

704
00:29:53.748 --> 00:29:56.577
They are no longer allowed
on the ranch."

705
00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:59.841
From that moment on.
they were persona non grata

706
00:29:59.885 --> 00:30:01.625
at the ranch.

707
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:03.976
Lincoln Hu
winds up getting a phone call

708
00:30:04.019 --> 00:30:05.847
and it's Doug Norby.

709
00:30:05.891 --> 00:30:08.676
"I know it wasn't you.
I know it was the other guys

710
00:30:08.719 --> 00:30:10.765
and I'm really sorry
that I used your name.

711
00:30:10.809 --> 00:30:14.290
but I really wanna thank you
for the plate of cookies

712
00:30:14.334 --> 00:30:15.683
that you sent me."

713
00:30:15.726 --> 00:30:17.859
And Lincoln says. "Doug.

714
00:30:17.903 --> 00:30:21.167
I wouldn't eat any of those
cookies if I was you."

715
00:30:25.171 --> 00:30:27.129
I'm Roger Ebert
of theChicago Sun Times.

716
00:30:27.173 --> 00:30:28.914
And I'm Gene Siskel
of theChicago Tribune

717
00:30:28.957 --> 00:30:30.829
and our first film
isTerminator 2.

718
00:30:32.178 --> 00:30:34.136
Thanks to some
truly spectacular

719
00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:35.790
and mystifying
special effects.

720
00:30:35.834 --> 00:30:37.357
this is one terrific
action picture.

721
00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.837
I enjoyed it a lot more
than the original.

722
00:30:39.663 --> 00:30:41.013
It hit the press big.

723
00:30:41.578 --> 00:30:43.015
Tons of publicity and stuff.

724
00:30:43.972 --> 00:30:45.104
Accolades.

725
00:30:46.061 --> 00:30:47.889
No one had ever seen
anything like it before.

726
00:30:48.977 --> 00:30:51.284
Mark Dippé and I.
we were like these superstars.

727
00:30:52.241 --> 00:30:54.200
The press was crazy.

728
00:30:54.243 --> 00:30:56.985
Dennis and I did
a Timemagazine article
together

729
00:30:57.029 --> 00:30:58.639
and the way it was shown
was like.

730
00:30:58.682 --> 00:31:01.033
uh. the sorcerer
and his young apprentice.

731
00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:04.340
I think Dennis was a supporter
of the idea. but...

732
00:31:05.385 --> 00:31:08.562
you know. he's like--
A-- He was worried.

733
00:31:08.605 --> 00:31:10.042
I didn't go into this show

734
00:31:10.085 --> 00:31:11.870
relying on CG
to be able to do it.

735
00:31:11.913 --> 00:31:13.610
I had a backup plan.

736
00:31:13.654 --> 00:31:16.352
I was ready at any time
to start pulling out the--

737
00:31:16.396 --> 00:31:19.965
To get the model shop going
and getting the foam beam.

738
00:31:20.008 --> 00:31:21.444
you know.
whipped up. and castings

739
00:31:21.488 --> 00:31:23.142
and everything like that
if we had to

740
00:31:23.185 --> 00:31:25.144
and try. you know.
other techniques to do it.

741
00:31:26.101 --> 00:31:28.364
Those guys were working
with limitations.

742
00:31:29.148 --> 00:31:30.714
Technical limitations.

743
00:31:31.454 --> 00:31:33.369
When computer graphics
came along.

744
00:31:34.066 --> 00:31:35.545
we're really trying
to do better

745
00:31:35.589 --> 00:31:36.895
what the guy did before.

746
00:31:38.984 --> 00:31:41.421
Steve really pushed
on everyone.

747
00:31:42.117 --> 00:31:43.466
He knew what we could do

748
00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:44.728
and that we could
push it further.

749
00:31:45.338 --> 00:31:47.209
Maybe that's where
some of the friction came from.

750
00:31:47.818 --> 00:31:49.385
It will be no secret

751
00:31:49.429 --> 00:31:52.867
that Dennis
and Spaz's relationship...

752
00:31:56.305 --> 00:32:00.353
was not always
the friendliest thing.

753
00:32:00.396 --> 00:32:01.963
Oddly enough.
the biggest obstacles

754
00:32:02.007 --> 00:32:04.226
I ran into
were the experts at ILM.

755
00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:07.360
They were the obstacles.
It wasn't the technology.

756
00:32:07.403 --> 00:32:08.752
They were the obstacles.

757
00:32:09.797 --> 00:32:11.494
He was like having
the crazy grandfather

758
00:32:11.538 --> 00:32:13.105
in the room
that was in World War II

759
00:32:13.148 --> 00:32:15.324
and is mumbling stories
about World War II.

760
00:32:15.368 --> 00:32:17.109
but you're supposed
to listen to him

761
00:32:17.152 --> 00:32:18.675
because if you don't. you know.

762
00:32:18.719 --> 00:32:21.504
it's considered
politically incorrect.

763
00:32:21.548 --> 00:32:23.550
The big shift
in your time. I guess.

764
00:32:23.593 --> 00:32:24.986
was from optical to digital

765
00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:26.640
and. so.
you went through. what.

766
00:32:26.683 --> 00:32:28.947
a kind of crisis
or a period of learning?

767
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:30.861
The credit was given
to the person

768
00:32:30.905 --> 00:32:32.994
that actually didn't even
understand how it was done.

769
00:32:33.038 --> 00:32:34.822
The Abyss just looked amazing

770
00:32:34.865 --> 00:32:36.998
and I thought.
"This is gonna work."

771
00:32:37.042 --> 00:32:39.000
And I don't understand it.

772
00:32:39.044 --> 00:32:41.437
This was such a new technology.
he wouldn't have had any clue.

773
00:32:47.356 --> 00:32:51.056
I got that big van Dam
folly book on CG.

774
00:32:51.099 --> 00:32:54.494
I read that just from front
to back over a period of weeks.

775
00:32:59.064 --> 00:33:00.282
After The Abyss.

776
00:33:00.935 --> 00:33:02.719
he got an Oscar for it.

777
00:33:02.763 --> 00:33:04.547
And I'm here
for Industrial Light and Magic

778
00:33:04.591 --> 00:33:06.201
and thanks everybody
who worked on the show

779
00:33:06.245 --> 00:33:08.160
from up there.
John Knoll and. uh.

780
00:33:08.203 --> 00:33:10.249
everyone in the computer
graphics department.

781
00:33:10.292 --> 00:33:12.294
And thanks so much.
especially to Jim Cameron.

782
00:33:12.338 --> 00:33:13.817
my wife. Zara. and Gregory.

783
00:33:13.861 --> 00:33:15.080
Thank you!

784
00:33:23.566 --> 00:33:26.700
No. I missed that.
uh. where-- What's this?

785
00:33:26.743 --> 00:33:28.745
For The Abyss?
What-- It looks a little soft.

786
00:33:29.659 --> 00:33:32.793
I think in any environment
like that.

787
00:33:32.836 --> 00:33:36.536
you're gonna have some.
uh. jealousy.

788
00:33:37.319 --> 00:33:40.583
Everybody is jockeying
for a position.

789
00:33:41.541 --> 00:33:43.195
But I don't think.
uh. Steve Williams

790
00:33:43.238 --> 00:33:44.805
was jockeying for anything.

791
00:33:45.458 --> 00:33:47.547
He was not a ladder climber.

792
00:33:48.635 --> 00:33:51.029
He just wanted to have fun
and do his art.

793
00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:55.033
He was the one
actually hands-on creating.

794
00:33:56.338 --> 00:33:59.037
He would work late nights
in the pit.

795
00:33:59.515 --> 00:34:00.995
That's when he would focus
the most

796
00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:02.910
and follow his own instincts.

797
00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:06.957
Politically.
you don't see this stuff coming

798
00:34:07.001 --> 00:34:08.698
because you're so engrossed
in what you're doing.

799
00:34:10.526 --> 00:34:12.180
There's always been bureaucracy

800
00:34:12.224 --> 00:34:14.095
and red tape and politics

801
00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:17.098
and there were politics at ILM
back in the day. too.

802
00:34:17.664 --> 00:34:19.796
You know.
there was a big man on campus.

803
00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:20.884
bigger than Steve.

804
00:34:21.711 --> 00:34:24.932
Won numerous Oscars.

805
00:34:24.975 --> 00:34:27.239
I'd like to thank my mom
and John Berg and Phil Tippett

806
00:34:27.282 --> 00:34:29.067
and Ken
and all the camera department.

807
00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:31.112
And thank you very much
to Mike McAllister. uh.

808
00:34:31.156 --> 00:34:33.332
Mike Pangrazio.
and the math department.

809
00:34:33.375 --> 00:34:35.160
I'd very much like to thank
Bruce Nicholson.

810
00:34:35.203 --> 00:34:37.466
Mike McAllister.
Mike Owens.

811
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:39.164
Well.
thank you to the Academy.

812
00:34:39.207 --> 00:34:41.122
and Steven Spielberg.
George Lucas.

813
00:34:41.166 --> 00:34:43.124
Kathy Kennedy. Frank Marshall.
and Robert Watts.

814
00:34:43.168 --> 00:34:44.865
This is a big thrill.

815
00:34:44.908 --> 00:34:46.649
We'd really like to thank
the Academy.

816
00:34:46.693 --> 00:34:48.477
Joe Dante for doing
his great direction.

817
00:34:48.521 --> 00:34:50.000
Mike Finnell.
of course. Steven Spielberg-

818
00:34:50.044 --> 00:34:51.959
His name was gonna be
at the top.

819
00:34:52.002 --> 00:34:53.439
regardless of all the people
who were working underneath

820
00:34:53.482 --> 00:34:54.614
and there were dozens
and dozens.

821
00:34:54.657 --> 00:34:56.311
Steve was just one of 'em.

822
00:34:56.355 --> 00:34:58.661
Secondly. there's the concept
of. you know.

823
00:34:58.705 --> 00:35:00.663
there's your story.
there's my story.

824
00:35:00.707 --> 00:35:02.100
and there's the story.

825
00:35:02.665 --> 00:35:03.753
I think. you know...

826
00:35:05.146 --> 00:35:08.062
history is written
for the victors.

827
00:35:10.412 --> 00:35:12.632
The Oscar goes to
Dennis Muren.

828
00:35:12.675 --> 00:35:14.851
Stan Winston.
Gene Warren. Jr..

829
00:35:14.895 --> 00:35:16.375
and Robert Skotak.

830
00:35:16.418 --> 00:35:18.246
Terminator 2:
Judgement Day.

831
00:35:22.163 --> 00:35:24.470
Thanks to. uh. everyone
at Industrial Light and Magic.

832
00:35:24.513 --> 00:35:27.037
and especially my incredible
computer graphic team.

833
00:35:27.081 --> 00:35:30.737
To Janet Healy. Mark Dippé.
my wife. Zara. Gregory.

834
00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:33.914
and Gwendolyn.
and especially Jim Cameron.

835
00:35:44.054 --> 00:35:45.143
He didn't mention me.

836
00:35:47.014 --> 00:35:49.234
I remember I was so mad.
I put my fist through a wall.

837
00:36:08.775 --> 00:36:10.298
I never thought about.
politically.

838
00:36:10.342 --> 00:36:11.734
how to play
this fuckin' chess game.

839
00:36:14.259 --> 00:36:16.348
We were thinking about
creating the art. right?

840
00:36:16.391 --> 00:36:17.566
Creating these ideas.

841
00:36:19.046 --> 00:36:20.526
We weren't thinking about.

842
00:36:20.569 --> 00:36:21.701
"What does
this mean for my future?"

843
00:36:21.744 --> 00:36:25.792
♪

844
00:36:33.626 --> 00:36:35.105
There's always
gonna be a bigger fish

845
00:36:35.149 --> 00:36:36.194
who's gonna get
the credit.

846
00:36:38.457 --> 00:36:39.936
That's how the game is played.

847
00:36:41.851 --> 00:36:42.939
That's life.

848
00:36:44.767 --> 00:36:46.726
If you wanna stay
in the industry.

849
00:36:46.769 --> 00:36:47.857
you gotta play the game.

850
00:36:51.034 --> 00:36:52.297
Steve didn't play that game.

851
00:36:53.733 --> 00:36:55.996
He didn't know how to.
He didn't want to.

852
00:36:59.695 --> 00:37:00.914
That's why he stood out.

853
00:37:03.569 --> 00:37:05.658
You learn a lot
in an environment like that.

854
00:37:05.701 --> 00:37:07.964
Not just about how to do.

855
00:37:08.008 --> 00:37:11.707
what is. ostensibly. your job.
but how it fits with the rest.

856
00:37:14.449 --> 00:37:17.322
Not everybody really fits
that environment

857
00:37:17.844 --> 00:37:20.586
and you function
within this hierarchy.

858
00:37:21.978 --> 00:37:24.590
This is the sort of
through to the bone moment

859
00:37:24.633 --> 00:37:27.549
where you realize.
"Yes. the game is changing."

860
00:37:34.295 --> 00:37:37.690
In June of '91.
this meeting happened

861
00:37:37.733 --> 00:37:40.345
at a place called
Yu Shang across from ILM.

862
00:37:40.997 --> 00:37:42.695
So. Mark Dippé
and I are sitting there

863
00:37:42.738 --> 00:37:45.219
and Dennis Muren's there.
John Schlag's there.

864
00:37:45.263 --> 00:37:48.570
Mike Natkin is there.
Stefen Fangmeier's there.

865
00:37:49.267 --> 00:37:52.008
Muren said Steven Spielberg
is coming up with this new film

866
00:37:52.052 --> 00:37:53.532
based on
Michael Crighton's book

867
00:37:53.575 --> 00:37:54.881
called Jurassic Park.

868
00:37:55.621 --> 00:37:58.754
It's about a bunch of dinosaurs
in a park and it goes awry.

869
00:37:58.798 --> 00:38:00.930
When Jurassicstarted.

870
00:38:00.974 --> 00:38:03.455
there were three
different approaches

871
00:38:03.498 --> 00:38:05.979
in companies
that were going to handle it.

872
00:38:06.022 --> 00:38:09.678
Stan Winston's group would do
the physical creatures.

873
00:38:09.722 --> 00:38:10.897
the close ups.

874
00:38:11.506 --> 00:38:14.335
Phil Tippet's group
would do the medium shots

875
00:38:14.379 --> 00:38:16.642
via stop-motion
where you could see

876
00:38:16.685 --> 00:38:18.470
all the action
of a dinosaur.

877
00:38:19.514 --> 00:38:23.213
And then ILM would do
the far away heard shots.

878
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:25.259
The long shots.

879
00:38:25.303 --> 00:38:26.826
Oh. they're way over there

880
00:38:26.869 --> 00:38:28.567
and they're only this big
in the frame

881
00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:30.699
and we can get away
with all kinds of cheats.

882
00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:33.354
These are the decisions we made.

883
00:38:33.398 --> 00:38:35.617
Here's where we're going.
This is great.

884
00:38:38.490 --> 00:38:43.669
So. Steve Williams.
Mark Dippé said.

885
00:38:43.712 --> 00:38:45.061
"Why don't we just build
the whole thing

886
00:38:45.105 --> 00:38:46.193
on computer graphics?

887
00:38:46.672 --> 00:38:48.151
Let's just do
the whole thing."

888
00:38:52.895 --> 00:38:54.941
Yeah. that's a tough one. um--

889
00:38:54.984 --> 00:38:56.682
Sure. Yeah. um--

890
00:38:56.725 --> 00:38:59.162
We're all like. uh. okay?

891
00:38:59.206 --> 00:39:00.816
We're ready for this.
we can do this.

892
00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:02.601
-We gotta fuckin' do it.
-Oh. no.

893
00:39:02.644 --> 00:39:04.777
No. no. no. no. no.
Nope. Nope.

894
00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:07.867
Muren. he's just blank.
Like. Orphan Annie eyes.

895
00:39:08.346 --> 00:39:10.870
Fangmeier. he jumped in
right away and said no.

896
00:39:10.913 --> 00:39:13.829
We're in the last stretches
of completing Terminator 2.

897
00:39:13.873 --> 00:39:17.267
We're working 16-hour days.
we're all worn out.

898
00:39:17.311 --> 00:39:19.313
So. I think
we were rather cautious.

899
00:39:19.357 --> 00:39:22.751
The amount of work is so large
and unknowns. so many.

900
00:39:22.795 --> 00:39:25.406
People were being negative.

901
00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:27.974
Now. look.
you've done chrome.

902
00:39:28.017 --> 00:39:29.758
you've done water.

903
00:39:29.802 --> 00:39:31.412
but you've never done anything
living. breathing.

904
00:39:31.456 --> 00:39:34.197
The liquid metal.
poly alloy Terminator

905
00:39:34.241 --> 00:39:36.635
was simpler than a dinosaur.

906
00:39:36.678 --> 00:39:38.506
We knew
we'd never done it before.

907
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:39.986
Even The Abyss.
I'd never done that before.

908
00:39:40.029 --> 00:39:41.727
but I said I could do it.

909
00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:43.032
T2. same thing.
I'd never done it before.

910
00:39:43.076 --> 00:39:44.556
but I said I could do it.

911
00:39:44.599 --> 00:39:46.340
Steve Williams
and Mark Dippé

912
00:39:46.384 --> 00:39:48.386
knew that the time
was right.

913
00:39:48.429 --> 00:39:49.648
They could just see it.

914
00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:53.129
The opportunity was there.
they wanted to seize it.

915
00:39:53.173 --> 00:39:56.437
And I think other people
was like "Whoa. that's--

916
00:39:56.481 --> 00:39:58.831
No. we're not going
into this whole new realm."

917
00:40:00.659 --> 00:40:04.140
The powers that be
were just so concerned.

918
00:40:05.054 --> 00:40:06.969
Phil was definitely a nay-sayer
in the beginning.

919
00:40:08.493 --> 00:40:10.320
I kinda felt it was. like...

920
00:40:11.409 --> 00:40:12.453
the Wild West.

921
00:40:13.759 --> 00:40:15.413
These new guys were coming in.

922
00:40:16.109 --> 00:40:18.677
The young gunslingers.
you know.

923
00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:22.028
it was like. you know.
I can outdraw you.

924
00:40:23.159 --> 00:40:26.554
Phil Tippett.
the enfant terrible

925
00:40:26.598 --> 00:40:28.643
of stop motion visual effects.

926
00:40:29.644 --> 00:40:31.080
He'’s the real deal.

927
00:40:31.646 --> 00:40:34.170
Watching Phil Tippett work.

928
00:40:34.214 --> 00:40:36.216
it was real apparent
real quick

929
00:40:36.259 --> 00:40:37.913
that he was
one of those magic people.

930
00:40:40.133 --> 00:40:41.961
When you have
that much talent

931
00:40:42.004 --> 00:40:44.006
and you have
that much knowledge

932
00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:46.313
and you have
that much work discipline.

933
00:40:46.356 --> 00:40:49.795
it makes you
a sort of super.

934
00:40:49.838 --> 00:40:51.144
uber effects geek.

935
00:40:51.927 --> 00:40:53.189
And that was Phil.

936
00:40:54.843 --> 00:40:56.889
Phil Tippett
and Dennis Muren both worked

937
00:40:56.932 --> 00:41:00.936
at Cascade at the early parts
of their careers.

938
00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:04.462
They worked on Dragon Slayer
together in 1981.

939
00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.595
They'’d had a long relationship.

940
00:41:08.988 --> 00:41:11.338
Right from the start.
Dennis was in the position

941
00:41:11.381 --> 00:41:13.296
of having people that he knew

942
00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:15.603
that he wanted to make sure
they were a part of the mix.

943
00:41:17.213 --> 00:41:19.128
Steve knew what we could do.

944
00:41:19.172 --> 00:41:20.390
and that
we could push it further.

945
00:41:21.566 --> 00:41:24.569
I perceived
just a slight amount of.

946
00:41:24.612 --> 00:41:27.223
you know.
competition on their side.

947
00:41:27.267 --> 00:41:29.574
you know.
needing to prove themselves.

948
00:41:29.617 --> 00:41:31.271
That'’s why Phil got mad.

949
00:41:31.314 --> 00:41:33.186
Because we were trying
to do a stop-motion film

950
00:41:33.229 --> 00:41:34.492
using computer graphics.

951
00:41:35.188 --> 00:41:36.842
He led the camp that

952
00:41:36.885 --> 00:41:38.626
that is the wrong road
to go down.

953
00:41:39.975 --> 00:41:41.586
I think from
Dennis'’ point of view.

954
00:41:41.629 --> 00:41:42.804
he was worried.

955
00:41:43.762 --> 00:41:45.590
He'’s. like.
"“Dude. this is a lot different

956
00:41:45.633 --> 00:41:47.026
than liquid metal."”

957
00:41:47.069 --> 00:41:49.115
And then Phil was like.

958
00:41:49.158 --> 00:41:51.770
"“Computer animation.
that'’s the wrong approach."”

959
00:41:52.858 --> 00:41:55.817
The stop-motion footage
was the selected solution.

960
00:41:55.861 --> 00:41:58.733
Full-scale
animatronics with Stan Winston.

961
00:41:58.777 --> 00:42:00.909
That was the approach
that was agreed upon

962
00:42:00.953 --> 00:42:02.520
and that was the road
they were going down.

963
00:42:03.129 --> 00:42:04.826
Everything had been assigned.

964
00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:06.524
Stan'’s doing this.
Phil'’s doing this.

965
00:42:06.567 --> 00:42:07.612
Stan'’s doing this
and that'’s it.

966
00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:09.570
This is the technology
we are using.

967
00:42:09.614 --> 00:42:11.354
There is no room
for a new technology.

968
00:42:19.537 --> 00:42:21.408
There was something
about being told no.

969
00:42:21.451 --> 00:42:25.281
um. you know.
if you'’re rebellious.

970
00:42:25.325 --> 00:42:28.981
you know. "no" is actually
really. um. a fuel for you.

971
00:42:30.069 --> 00:42:33.115
He took it
upon himself to just prove it

972
00:42:33.159 --> 00:42:36.292
and the only way
to prove that is to show it.

973
00:42:36.336 --> 00:42:39.121
Steve. Spaz.
starts by making a skeleton.

974
00:42:42.255 --> 00:42:44.518
I literally did
exactly what I did

975
00:42:44.562 --> 00:42:47.260
with the T-Rex
that I did with the T-1000.

976
00:42:48.348 --> 00:42:50.002
I just built the bones.

977
00:42:50.829 --> 00:42:54.136
I built the damn thing.
secretly. on my own time.

978
00:42:55.224 --> 00:42:57.009
It was a complete act
of rebellion.

979
00:42:58.793 --> 00:43:00.447
I think one of the reasons
they tried to stop

980
00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:02.231
that type of innovation
is because

981
00:43:02.275 --> 00:43:04.625
the visual effects gurus
who didn'’t theorize it.

982
00:43:04.669 --> 00:43:07.323
would be seen
as having egg on their face.

983
00:43:08.498 --> 00:43:09.935
I just believed we could do it.

984
00:43:11.414 --> 00:43:12.851
But actually having to prove it.

985
00:43:13.634 --> 00:43:14.853
that was the challenge.

986
00:43:15.593 --> 00:43:16.724
Because it was all about proof.

987
00:43:18.117 --> 00:43:19.771
I remember
Dennis Muren. actually.

988
00:43:19.814 --> 00:43:22.121
he had heard a rumor
from one of his little

989
00:43:22.164 --> 00:43:23.862
weaselly minions
that I was building

990
00:43:23.905 --> 00:43:25.080
a set of T-Rex bones.

991
00:43:25.907 --> 00:43:27.605
He told me. to my face.

992
00:43:29.171 --> 00:43:31.434
"Don'’t bother trying to build
the T-Rex."

993
00:43:32.305 --> 00:43:33.523
Phil'’s doing it.

994
00:43:34.873 --> 00:43:36.265
I was saying.
"Guys. don'’t do this.

995
00:43:36.309 --> 00:43:38.050
"you know.
Phil-- Phil'’s my buddy.

996
00:43:38.093 --> 00:43:39.878
he'’s got the job
for everything else. you know?

997
00:43:39.921 --> 00:43:41.749
And just let this play out."

998
00:43:41.793 --> 00:43:43.577
That'’s what he said.
That'’s what he said.

999
00:43:43.621 --> 00:43:44.970
And he hadn'’t seen
anything yet.

1000
00:43:47.712 --> 00:43:51.629
I don'’t worry
about hardly anything. ever.

1001
00:43:54.762 --> 00:43:56.068
Although...

1002
00:43:57.156 --> 00:43:58.984
you know. I'’ve got this anxiety

1003
00:43:59.027 --> 00:44:01.203
that'’s like
the sword of Damocles

1004
00:44:01.247 --> 00:44:02.770
that'’s hanging over my head.

1005
00:44:04.729 --> 00:44:06.426
Sometimes. I just feel like

1006
00:44:07.209 --> 00:44:08.515
something terrible''’s
gonna happen.

1007
00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:13.607
Steve Williams. uh.

1008
00:44:13.651 --> 00:44:17.219
on his own. put together
a Tyrannosaurus skeleton

1009
00:44:17.263 --> 00:44:19.352
and did a walk cycle.

1010
00:44:20.614 --> 00:44:25.880
♪

1011
00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:33.801
I don'’t think
we fully realized...

1012
00:44:35.368 --> 00:44:36.543
how...

1013
00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:41.026
that was going
to change everything.

1014
00:44:41.679 --> 00:44:43.332
It was all secret.
no one knew about it.

1015
00:44:44.943 --> 00:44:46.901
There was a big meeting
that was going to happen.

1016
00:44:47.772 --> 00:44:49.425
Kathleen Kennedy.

1017
00:44:49.469 --> 00:44:52.385
Frank Marshall. Dennis Muren.
and Janet Healy.

1018
00:44:53.255 --> 00:44:55.301
Janet Healy is the producer.

1019
00:44:55.344 --> 00:44:58.260
Dennis Muren is the visual
effects supervisor.

1020
00:44:58.304 --> 00:45:01.133
I looked at it as. like.
"Oh. this is mom and dad."

1021
00:45:01.176 --> 00:45:02.438
They'’re in charge.

1022
00:45:03.831 --> 00:45:06.312
I didn''’t know when the
entourage
was gonna come up.

1023
00:45:06.355 --> 00:45:07.879
but I knew
they were coming up eventually.

1024
00:45:07.922 --> 00:45:09.924
so I got wind of it.

1025
00:45:09.968 --> 00:45:12.579
Frank and Kathy had come in
because Steven couldn'’t come in.

1026
00:45:14.015 --> 00:45:17.062
Kathleen Kennedy was
Steven Spielberg'’s producer.

1027
00:45:17.105 --> 00:45:19.238
Kathleen Kennedy.
Frank Marshall.

1028
00:45:19.281 --> 00:45:21.762
they were gonna come walking in
on a Monday morning

1029
00:45:21.806 --> 00:45:23.808
in November in 1991.

1030
00:45:23.851 --> 00:45:25.505
And I guess
the hard part of that

1031
00:45:25.548 --> 00:45:27.159
was he had to find
a way to get that

1032
00:45:27.202 --> 00:45:29.465
in front of Kathleen Kennedy.

1033
00:45:30.423 --> 00:45:31.772
And he found a way to do that.

1034
00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:34.819
This was not supposed to happen.

1035
00:45:36.255 --> 00:45:38.474
Dennis and Janet. they didn'’t
know it was gonna happen.

1036
00:45:40.172 --> 00:45:41.956
I had a playing on a monitor.

1037
00:45:42.827 --> 00:45:44.654
and everyone came walking in.

1038
00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:47.919
She immediately
sees it right away.

1039
00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:50.269
and she goes. "“What'’s this?"”

1040
00:45:51.879 --> 00:45:53.228
I said.
"“Well. I was just working on

1041
00:45:53.272 --> 00:45:55.448
this walking T-Rex bone thing."”

1042
00:45:59.234 --> 00:46:01.149
Kathleen Kennedy pats me
on the back and goes.

1043
00:46:01.193 --> 00:46:03.238
"“You have a very bright future."”
And that was that.

1044
00:46:04.022 --> 00:46:05.980
That'’s the first
and only time I ever met her.

1045
00:46:06.415 --> 00:46:08.069
I never-- never saw her again.

1046
00:46:09.114 --> 00:46:10.985
That'’s where everything changed.

1047
00:46:11.029 --> 00:46:13.814
Dennis Muren said. "Okay.
this is really interesting.

1048
00:46:13.858 --> 00:46:15.642
I didn'’t know
how close we could get.

1049
00:46:15.685 --> 00:46:17.905
And then eventually
some of the guys did some tests

1050
00:46:17.949 --> 00:46:19.994
on a T-Rex
which came out really great

1051
00:46:20.038 --> 00:46:23.258
and surprised everybody
and then we skinned that.

1052
00:46:23.302 --> 00:46:25.434
All we had at this time was
a skeleton and we were going.

1053
00:46:25.478 --> 00:46:27.219
-"We can do it!"
-Stan Winston is gonna set up

1054
00:46:27.262 --> 00:46:29.525
a five-foot model.
Mark and I cut it up into bits

1055
00:46:30.135 --> 00:46:33.747
and we put it in a cyborg
scanner and scan all the pieces.

1056
00:46:33.791 --> 00:46:35.575
I have to reconstruct

1057
00:46:35.618 --> 00:46:37.838
all the data to have
the proper contour muscles.

1058
00:46:38.491 --> 00:46:41.146
I built the skin version
of the T-Rex.

1059
00:46:41.624 --> 00:46:42.974
It was all working.

1060
00:46:43.409 --> 00:46:45.715
ILM. you know.
largely through Steve Williams.

1061
00:46:45.759 --> 00:46:48.196
Mark Dippé. and. uh.
Stefen Fangmeier

1062
00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:50.459
put together
the first dinosaur tests.

1063
00:46:50.503 --> 00:46:52.287
The film couldn'’t
have happened without them.

1064
00:46:52.331 --> 00:46:53.811
It certainly
couldn'’t have happened

1065
00:46:53.854 --> 00:46:55.725
without Steve'’s
ability to model.

1066
00:46:55.769 --> 00:46:57.162
uh. first the Terminator
and then later the dinosaurs.

1067
00:46:57.205 --> 00:46:58.641
The film. at the same time.

1068
00:46:58.685 --> 00:47:00.339
also was very much
still on track

1069
00:47:00.382 --> 00:47:02.167
to do. uh. stop-motion.

1070
00:47:02.907 --> 00:47:05.083
Back then.
everything that we did

1071
00:47:05.126 --> 00:47:06.519
hadn'’t been done before.

1072
00:47:06.562 --> 00:47:07.694
I mean. certainly.
nobody attempted

1073
00:47:07.737 --> 00:47:09.522
to do dinosaurs before.

1074
00:47:09.565 --> 00:47:14.179
They made a convincing
computer graphic Tyrannosaurus.

1075
00:47:15.267 --> 00:47:17.356
The first fully skinned version.

1076
00:47:17.878 --> 00:47:19.749
And we had it walkin'’.
In daylight.

1077
00:47:20.489 --> 00:47:23.449
Then Dennis and Janet
with Tippett went down

1078
00:47:23.492 --> 00:47:25.843
to Universal to show it
to Steven Spielberg.

1079
00:47:26.626 --> 00:47:27.888
but I wasn'’t
allowed to be there.

1080
00:47:28.802 --> 00:47:30.586
I got a call from Dennis Muren
at ILM.

1081
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:32.284
who already had the job

1082
00:47:32.327 --> 00:47:33.807
of doing Jurassic Park
with Phil Tippett.

1083
00:47:33.851 --> 00:47:35.504
And Dennis said
that he thought

1084
00:47:35.548 --> 00:47:38.551
that he could
pull off a full-sized dinosaur

1085
00:47:38.594 --> 00:47:40.858
that would be authentic
to the eye.

1086
00:47:40.901 --> 00:47:42.903
Spielberg suddenly went
absolutely insane

1087
00:47:42.947 --> 00:47:45.297
and said everything was gonna
be computer graphics now.

1088
00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:47.081
That'’s the future.

1089
00:47:48.039 --> 00:47:50.737
That'’s the way
it'’s gonna be from now on.

1090
00:48:14.804 --> 00:48:17.590
That first
shot of the Brachiosaurus...

1091
00:48:19.244 --> 00:48:21.681
my jaw dropped.
I had literally--

1092
00:48:27.774 --> 00:48:29.689
And then that wide reveal

1093
00:48:29.732 --> 00:48:31.560
of them all out there
on the plain.

1094
00:48:31.604 --> 00:48:33.649
♪

1095
00:48:37.305 --> 00:48:39.481
That'’s still the one
that gets my heart.

1096
00:48:43.746 --> 00:48:45.661
I swear to God.
it looked like

1097
00:48:45.705 --> 00:48:47.620
National Geographic went back
in a time machine

1098
00:48:47.663 --> 00:48:49.665
and shot real dinosaurs.
and that'’s what I fucking saw.

1099
00:48:49.709 --> 00:48:53.582
Those things looked real
and what they were representing

1100
00:48:53.626 --> 00:48:55.541
was not some sci-fi thing.

1101
00:48:56.846 --> 00:48:58.892
As far as we know.
those things moved around

1102
00:48:58.936 --> 00:49:00.459
like that and that'’s what
they looked like.

1103
00:49:00.502 --> 00:49:02.809
that'’s what they did.

1104
00:49:02.852 --> 00:49:05.203
Jurassic Park took
everybody by surprise.

1105
00:49:05.246 --> 00:49:06.726
Nobody saw that one coming.

1106
00:49:07.814 --> 00:49:10.773
For almost 75 years.
the technology

1107
00:49:10.817 --> 00:49:14.168
and the techniques
were pretty much the same.

1108
00:49:14.212 --> 00:49:17.258
Jurassic. that'’s when
the computers came in.

1109
00:49:20.348 --> 00:49:22.481
That'’s when the tsunami hit.

1110
00:49:24.048 --> 00:49:26.006
Jurassic Park opened tonight

1111
00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:29.009
with predictions that it may be
the biggest hit in years and.

1112
00:49:29.053 --> 00:49:30.663
like any great event.

1113
00:49:30.706 --> 00:49:32.447
people are camped out
to be part of it.

1114
00:49:32.491 --> 00:49:34.232
We got here
about 11 o'’clock this morning.

1115
00:49:34.275 --> 00:49:35.755
11:00
this morning for what show?

1116
00:49:35.798 --> 00:49:38.018
Uh. the 10:45 tomorrow morning.

1117
00:49:38.062 --> 00:49:42.022
That was the turning
point of visual filmmaking.

1118
00:49:42.066 --> 00:49:43.893
People. especially kids.

1119
00:49:43.937 --> 00:49:46.026
- like dinosaurs.
-Jurassic Park!

1120
00:49:46.070 --> 00:49:47.854
Where the giant dinosaurs
live again!

1121
00:49:47.897 --> 00:49:49.464
With all the excitement

1122
00:49:49.508 --> 00:49:51.162
-of the movie!
-Dino damage!

1123
00:49:51.205 --> 00:49:52.685
Only at Jurassic Park!

1124
00:49:53.947 --> 00:49:56.602
The film was supposed
to be a stop-motion film.

1125
00:49:57.646 --> 00:49:59.344
Computer graphics came in

1126
00:49:59.387 --> 00:50:01.476
and completely deposed
all of it.

1127
00:50:02.956 --> 00:50:05.132
It destroyed one thing.
but it begat another.

1128
00:50:06.481 --> 00:50:08.701
I had come up
with this test that--

1129
00:50:08.744 --> 00:50:11.138
It seemed it revolutionized
everything.

1130
00:50:11.182 --> 00:50:13.836
The call came down--
Dennis called me at home

1131
00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:16.796
and said. "I'’m afraid
I have some bad news.

1132
00:50:16.839 --> 00:50:20.017
Steven'’s decided
to do the whole show CG

1133
00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:22.236
and I-- You know.
like the Bombay doors just.

1134
00:50:25.544 --> 00:50:27.111
You know. I saw.
you know. like.

1135
00:50:27.154 --> 00:50:29.026
the-- the end and I--
"Oh. shit.

1136
00:50:29.069 --> 00:50:30.723
now what am I gonna do?

1137
00:50:30.766 --> 00:50:32.594
I thought. because
I was animation supervisor

1138
00:50:32.638 --> 00:50:36.337
on. um. Terminator 2.
which is very successful.

1139
00:50:36.381 --> 00:50:37.904
you know. I was gonna be

1140
00:50:37.947 --> 00:50:38.818
animation supervisor
on Jurassic.

1141
00:50:40.472 --> 00:50:42.648
I literally ambushed them
with the image.

1142
00:50:42.691 --> 00:50:44.563
I thought.
"How much more can I do

1143
00:50:44.606 --> 00:50:46.608
to actually to prove
that I came up with the idea?"

1144
00:50:47.522 --> 00:50:49.872
I thought for sure
it was a slam dunk.

1145
00:50:51.309 --> 00:50:52.919
There was no definition

1146
00:50:52.962 --> 00:50:54.964
about what the jobs were
on Jurassic Park.

1147
00:50:55.791 --> 00:50:57.532
So. I asked Janet Healy.

1148
00:50:57.576 --> 00:50:58.881
I said. "“Well. you know.
what'’s goin' on?

1149
00:50:58.925 --> 00:51:00.666
What'’s my position?"”

1150
00:51:00.709 --> 00:51:02.537
"“You'’re just an animator
on the film."”

1151
00:51:02.581 --> 00:51:05.497
"“What? Who'’s
the animation supervisor?"”

1152
00:51:08.891 --> 00:51:10.589
Dennis.
in all of his brilliance.

1153
00:51:11.633 --> 00:51:13.679
he has a plan B.

1154
00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:24.690
Phil Tippett wanted to actually

1155
00:51:24.733 --> 00:51:26.822
do storyboards
three dimensionally

1156
00:51:26.866 --> 00:51:30.174
with little figures
of dinosaurs and people

1157
00:51:30.217 --> 00:51:33.002
that would completely imitate
my storyboards.

1158
00:51:33.046 --> 00:51:36.310
but flesh out my storyboards
and give them dimension.

1159
00:51:36.354 --> 00:51:38.138
Storyboards don'’t show you

1160
00:51:38.182 --> 00:51:40.749
any of the-- the temporal
cadence. the sequence.

1161
00:51:40.793 --> 00:51:44.318
the timing of it and. uh.
the animatics allowed us

1162
00:51:44.362 --> 00:51:48.017
to-- to block out the entire.
you know. sequence.

1163
00:51:49.715 --> 00:51:52.544
Phil was able
to turn himself

1164
00:51:52.587 --> 00:51:54.502
into the director
of the CGI dinosaurs.

1165
00:51:54.546 --> 00:51:57.940
He knew so much about dinosaurs
and the behavior of animals.

1166
00:51:57.984 --> 00:51:59.899
I go into dailies
at 8:00 AM

1167
00:51:59.942 --> 00:52:02.815
and there'’s Phil Tippett.
who'’s now functioning

1168
00:52:02.858 --> 00:52:05.339
as the animation director
for Jurassic Park.

1169
00:52:09.082 --> 00:52:12.781
Wow! And the Oscar goes to...

1170
00:52:12.825 --> 00:52:15.436
Dennis Muren. Stan Winston.
Phil Tippett.

1171
00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:18.222
and Michael Lantieri
for Jurassic Park !

1172
00:52:18.265 --> 00:52:19.745
♪

1173
00:52:33.367 --> 00:52:35.152
Thanks. ILM.
Thanks. Tippet Studios.

1174
00:52:35.195 --> 00:52:37.328
Thanks. Steven Spielberg.
Thanks Mike--

1175
00:52:54.345 --> 00:52:56.564
I'’ve always believed the people

1176
00:52:56.608 --> 00:52:59.437
that worked on the work
should be acknowledged for it.

1177
00:53:01.265 --> 00:53:04.746
Any time an individual
took an award

1178
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:07.793
and took the award home
and took the accolades for it.

1179
00:53:07.836 --> 00:53:09.447
to me. it was theft.

1180
00:53:11.405 --> 00:53:13.538
ILM had won
14 Oscars at that time.

1181
00:53:15.757 --> 00:53:17.629
Not one of ''‘em were at ILM.

1182
00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:20.675
Not one!

1183
00:53:22.242 --> 00:53:24.201
So. these guys had
the audacity

1184
00:53:24.244 --> 00:53:27.029
to actually take this piece
of shit home with them

1185
00:53:27.073 --> 00:53:29.989
when it was representing
30 or 40 people.

1186
00:53:31.817 --> 00:53:33.297
Regardless of what they do...

1187
00:53:34.298 --> 00:53:36.735
this is what
their credit is on the film.

1188
00:53:36.778 --> 00:53:38.215
And if it wins an Oscar

1189
00:53:38.258 --> 00:53:39.520
for visual effects.
they get it.

1190
00:53:42.088 --> 00:53:43.350
That'’s the way it works.

1191
00:53:44.656 --> 00:53:46.223
If you point
to any one person

1192
00:53:46.266 --> 00:53:48.050
it couldn'’t have
been done without 'em.

1193
00:53:48.094 --> 00:53:49.878
it probably is Steve.
''‘cause I don'’t know

1194
00:53:49.922 --> 00:53:51.706
that anybody else could'’ve
modeled those dinosaurs.

1195
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:53.230
I don'’t know
that anybody else could'’ve set

1196
00:53:53.273 --> 00:53:54.535
the standards
for animating them.

1197
00:53:54.579 --> 00:53:55.754
I don'’t know
that we would'’ve even tried.

1198
00:53:59.845 --> 00:54:00.933
I'’m not a diplomat.

1199
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:03.718
I never have been.

1200
00:54:05.416 --> 00:54:07.766
To a fault.
I'’ve been a very bad diplomat.

I'’m not political.

I've--
I'’ve never been political.

00:54:14.338 --> 00:54:16.122
Right? I'’m not good at it.

1204
00:54:16.165 --> 00:54:17.471
You know. I-- Look at me.
for fuck'’s sakes.

1205
00:54:17.515 --> 00:54:18.820
man. I look like
fuckin'’ Popeye.

1206
00:54:18.864 --> 00:54:20.518
You know? Fuck.

1207
00:54:20.561 --> 00:54:22.563
After Jurassic.
I did a bunch of interviews

1208
00:54:22.607 --> 00:54:24.696
and stuff like that and I told
the truth about what happened.

1209
00:54:24.739 --> 00:54:26.611
The entire film
ofJurassic was--

1210
00:54:26.654 --> 00:54:27.786
This is Jurassic Park?

1211
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:28.961
Right.

1212
00:54:37.491 --> 00:54:39.058
I was told not to do it

1213
00:54:39.101 --> 00:54:40.842
by my supervisors and I did it.
you know?

1214
00:54:40.886 --> 00:54:42.366
I built it.

1215
00:54:42.931 --> 00:54:44.585
Dennis Muren
got mad at me a few times.

1216
00:54:45.282 --> 00:54:48.372
He pulled me into
his office and he said.

1217
00:54:48.415 --> 00:54:50.243
"I don'’t know
why you'’re saying all this."

1218
00:54:50.287 --> 00:54:52.201
And then I said. "Well. Dennis.
this is what happened."

1219
00:54:52.245 --> 00:54:55.030
And he goes. "You'’re committing
political suicide."

1220
00:54:55.074 --> 00:54:56.684
That'’s what he told me.

1221
00:54:56.728 --> 00:54:58.686
Steve Williams foresees the day

1222
00:54:58.730 --> 00:55:01.341
when it will be commonplace
for computer generated actors

1223
00:55:01.385 --> 00:55:04.257
to star alongside
real actors.

1224
00:55:04.301 --> 00:55:06.215
I think that you'’ll have
characters acting

1225
00:55:06.259 --> 00:55:09.436
with current famous people. um.
that are computer generated.

1226
00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:11.264
but you'’ll also be able
to introduce characters

1227
00:55:11.308 --> 00:55:14.006
that have been dead
for 50 or 60 years.

1228
00:55:14.049 --> 00:55:15.877
In the future. I mean. it'’s
quite obvious what'’ll happen.

1229
00:55:15.921 --> 00:55:18.489
It will actually scan the actor
in a polygonal data set

1230
00:55:18.532 --> 00:55:19.794
of computer generated data--

1231
00:55:19.838 --> 00:55:21.840
Are they worried
about this?

1232
00:55:21.883 --> 00:55:23.624
-If I was an actor I'’d. uh--
-Actually. SAG.

1233
00:55:23.668 --> 00:55:25.322
the Screen Actors Guild.
is very interested in it.

1234
00:55:25.365 --> 00:55:27.193
Are actors right
to have concerns

1235
00:55:27.236 --> 00:55:28.629
that they'’ll eventually
be phased out all together?

1236
00:55:28.673 --> 00:55:30.805
This will be abused
and-- and--

1237
00:55:30.849 --> 00:55:32.633
and the trick is
for all of us to stand up

1238
00:55:32.677 --> 00:55:34.331
and say.
"No. that'’s wrong.

1239
00:55:34.374 --> 00:55:35.767
This is a violation.

1240
00:55:35.810 --> 00:55:37.595
this is not
what we should be doing.

1241
00:55:37.638 --> 00:55:39.727
Synthetic actors are inevitable.
there'’s no doubt.

1242
00:55:39.771 --> 00:55:41.425
We'’re talking about
the morals!

1243
00:55:41.468 --> 00:55:42.948
This is unfortunately
what'’s happening.

1244
00:55:42.991 --> 00:55:44.993
To be human is to bleed.

1245
00:55:45.037 --> 00:55:46.995
is to have a soul.
is to breathe.

1246
00:55:47.039 --> 00:55:48.954
See-- see. we'’re not trying
to duplicate human beings.

1247
00:55:48.997 --> 00:55:51.173
but what you'’re seeing
is subjective already.

1248
00:55:51.217 --> 00:55:52.914
How many times
have you met an actor

1249
00:55:52.958 --> 00:55:54.916
who'’s either shorter
or smaller in person?

1250
00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:56.875
So. what you'’re seeing
is already an "interpretation"

1251
00:55:56.918 --> 00:55:59.094
-of what they look like.
-Absolutely.

1252
00:55:59.138 --> 00:56:01.140
-This is what we'’re trying--
-We'’re down

1253
00:56:01.183 --> 00:56:02.750
-to our last two minutes.
-Good afternoon.

1254
00:56:02.794 --> 00:56:04.273
my name is Thomas White.
I handle Artists' Rights

1255
00:56:04.317 --> 00:56:05.884
Enforcement Matters
for the estate

1256
00:56:05.927 --> 00:56:07.320
of Fred Astaire.
the estate of Orson Welles.

1257
00:56:07.364 --> 00:56:08.800
and the director.
Stanley Kramer.

1258
00:56:08.843 --> 00:56:10.671
All uses from my clients
get licensed.

1259
00:56:10.715 --> 00:56:12.412
If they don'’t get licensed.
they get prosecuted.

1260
00:56:12.456 --> 00:56:13.979
-It'’s that simple.
-Good.

1261
00:56:14.022 --> 00:56:16.416
And the damages--
the damages that we seek

1262
00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:18.897
and the attorney's fees
are extraordinarily high.

1263
00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:21.334
Thank you all very much
and I think we'’re done.

1264
00:56:23.423 --> 00:56:25.469
They all denied
what we were doing.

1265
00:56:26.121 --> 00:56:28.167
And. to me. that'’s a fight.

1266
00:56:29.342 --> 00:56:31.039
You wanna fuckin'’
get in a fight. man?

1267
00:56:31.083 --> 00:56:32.563
You wanna fuckin'’ drop
the gloves?

1268
00:56:32.606 --> 00:56:34.303
You wanna go? Let'’s go.

1269
00:56:38.917 --> 00:56:40.788
When it comes to
special effects

1270
00:56:40.832 --> 00:56:43.008
in the movies today.
the question really isn'’t

1271
00:56:43.051 --> 00:56:46.925
what can they do. the question
is what can'’t they do?

1272
00:56:46.968 --> 00:56:49.362
For the most part. I like having
fun and having a good laugh.

1273
00:56:49.406 --> 00:56:51.146
Cartoons are what
got me into this thing.

1274
00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:53.279
Animation supervisor
Steve Williams.

1275
00:56:53.322 --> 00:56:55.716
whose credits include
The Abyss and Jurassic Park

1276
00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:58.240
has been a cartoon buff
all his life.

1277
00:56:58.284 --> 00:57:02.114
After Jurassic.
I just didn'’t give a crap.

1278
00:57:02.157 --> 00:57:03.724
Everybody can go
fuck themselves.

1279
00:57:04.943 --> 00:57:07.075
These are the fuckin'’
good days. man.

1280
00:57:08.250 --> 00:57:10.949
He was uncontrollable.

1281
00:57:10.992 --> 00:57:15.954
This masculine. tough guy
that could not be harnessed.

1282
00:57:16.563 --> 00:57:19.131
That was kinda my first
experience working with him.

1283
00:57:19.784 --> 00:57:22.134
When you are in Steve'’s orbit.

1284
00:57:22.961 --> 00:57:26.443
it was like you were
in the spotlight with him.

1285
00:57:27.792 --> 00:57:30.751
You knew if you were
gonna be in his company

1286
00:57:30.795 --> 00:57:33.928
that you were gonna feel like
the queen of the world.

1287
00:57:35.495 --> 00:57:37.628
We grew to fall in love
with each other.

1288
00:57:38.977 --> 00:57:42.459
We started a relationship
that was very intense.

1289
00:57:43.024 --> 00:57:46.767
We wanted to start a family
and I moved up to Marin

1290
00:57:46.811 --> 00:57:49.509
from the city and it was like
boom. boom. boom.

1291
00:57:49.553 --> 00:57:51.468
I'’m starting the clock.
It'’s supposed to be--

1292
00:57:51.511 --> 00:57:53.078
I'’m totally shaking.

1293
00:57:53.121 --> 00:57:54.645
It's supposed
to be two minutes.

1294
00:57:54.688 --> 00:57:55.776
Okay.
I just peed on that thing.

1295
00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:57.343
It'’s fucking pink!

1296
00:57:57.386 --> 00:57:58.910
I know. I don'’t believe it!

1297
00:57:58.953 --> 00:58:00.085
I think you did it.

1298
00:58:00.128 --> 00:58:01.695
You big stud!

1299
00:58:01.739 --> 00:58:03.480
You big stud!
You did it!

1300
00:58:03.523 --> 00:58:05.046
We never got married.

1301
00:58:05.090 --> 00:58:07.005
We'’re gonna be
like hippies. man.

1302
00:58:07.048 --> 00:58:09.094
Not get married and have a kid.
and it was great. you know?

1303
00:58:11.879 --> 00:58:13.925
Hannah came along
and that was a new world.

1304
00:58:13.968 --> 00:58:15.187
that'’s for sure.

1305
00:58:16.971 --> 00:58:19.278
You think you know it all.
but this door gets opened.

1306
00:58:20.584 --> 00:58:21.628
Fatherhood.

1307
00:58:22.499 --> 00:58:24.762
What do you got. Hannah?
Tell me about your new car.

1308
00:58:24.805 --> 00:58:26.633
Um. I don'’t want to.

1309
00:58:26.677 --> 00:58:28.505
Okay. are you gonna
take it for a drive now?

1310
00:58:34.598 --> 00:58:36.469
It'’s really easy to hold on

1311
00:58:36.513 --> 00:58:39.559
to those perfect experiences

1312
00:58:39.603 --> 00:58:41.082
or a perfect time
in your life

1313
00:58:41.126 --> 00:58:42.954
or when
"“everything was better."

1314
00:58:44.999 --> 00:58:47.045
The movie making world changed.

1315
00:58:48.437 --> 00:58:50.352
He was right there. you know?

1316
00:58:50.396 --> 00:58:52.529
He was on the frontlines
of doing that.

1317
00:58:52.572 --> 00:58:55.532
Dippé and me
in a meat locker!

1318
00:58:55.575 --> 00:58:56.968
"The revolution is them."

1319
00:58:59.492 --> 00:59:01.538
Jurassicopened
the doors for all movies.

1320
00:59:02.016 --> 00:59:03.583
so it transformed filmmaking.

1321
00:59:03.627 --> 00:59:06.194
Everybody wanted digital.

1322
00:59:06.238 --> 00:59:08.545
Computer graphics
was the hot. new thing.

1323
00:59:12.157 --> 00:59:13.332
After Jurassic Park.

1324
00:59:14.028 --> 00:59:15.552
filmmaking went off the rails.

1325
00:59:15.595 --> 00:59:17.292
Computers allowed them to--

1326
00:59:17.945 --> 00:59:20.513
to make these spectacles.

1327
00:59:20.557 --> 00:59:23.516
Producers are always looking
for the magic ticket.

1328
00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:26.258
the secret button.
and they suddenly said

1329
00:59:26.301 --> 00:59:28.347
if it'’s got digital effects.

1330
00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:30.436
that'’s the button you press
that makes a gazillion bucks.

1331
00:59:30.479 --> 00:59:32.656
They think
the more of this little thing

1332
00:59:32.699 --> 00:59:35.310
that'’s great. you know.
and by increasing it

1333
00:59:35.354 --> 00:59:37.312
in these films. it'’s gonna
make the film better.

1334
00:59:37.356 --> 00:59:38.749
and it hasn'’t. it's actually
destroyed filmmaking.

1335
00:59:38.792 --> 00:59:40.446
More junk.
more junk. more junk.

1336
00:59:40.489 --> 00:59:42.187
faster. more junk.
more junk--

1337
00:59:46.104 --> 00:59:50.108
A successful movie is built
on a triangle.

1338
00:59:50.151 --> 00:59:53.198
You have art. on another point
you have technology.

1339
00:59:53.241 --> 00:59:55.461
and the other part
you have business.

1340
00:59:55.504 --> 00:59:58.638
And if any side gets
too big or too small.

1341
00:59:58.682 --> 01:00:00.727
the motion picture will suffer.

1342
01:00:02.468 --> 01:00:05.645
And it became more about
style over substance.

1343
01:00:05.689 --> 01:00:08.648
We saw all kinds
of horrible movies

1344
01:00:08.692 --> 01:00:10.389
with lots of visual effects.

1345
01:00:10.432 --> 01:00:11.695
You know
what we got rewarded for?

1346
01:00:11.738 --> 01:00:13.653
For fuckin'’ Jurassic Park?

1347
01:00:13.697 --> 01:00:15.612
Casper the Friendly Ghost.

1348
01:00:15.655 --> 01:00:17.178
I hated Casperwhen it was 2D.

1349
01:00:17.526 --> 01:00:19.790
Uh. Hi?

1350
01:00:19.833 --> 01:00:24.533
The concept became. "Let'’s redo
everything digitally."

1351
01:00:24.577 --> 01:00:26.710
right. that was done
in a two-dimensional medium.

1352
01:00:26.753 --> 01:00:28.407
I mean. if you look at
something like Scooby Doo.

1353
01:00:28.668 --> 01:00:33.325
this ridiculously
stupid-looking cartoon dog.

1354
01:00:34.195 --> 01:00:38.286
it'’s like. "No! That thing
does not exist in our world!

1355
01:00:38.330 --> 01:00:41.202
I refuse to believe it!
Take it away!"

1356
01:00:45.729 --> 01:00:46.991
♪ Through the

1357
01:00:47.034 --> 01:00:49.080
This was the period when

1358
01:00:49.123 --> 01:00:52.736
motion pictures stopped
being director-controlled

1359
01:00:52.779 --> 01:00:54.563
and started becoming
corporate-driven.

1360
01:00:55.173 --> 01:00:57.175
And this was
the beginning of the end.

1361
01:00:59.481 --> 01:01:01.266
The corporations have
just kind of

1362
01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:02.571
taken everything over.

1363
01:01:03.442 --> 01:01:05.400
And fucked everything up.

1364
01:01:06.097 --> 01:01:07.185
And...

1365
01:01:07.881 --> 01:01:10.014
But they can still sell.
you know.

1366
01:01:10.057 --> 01:01:12.059
lots of Coca-Cola. you know?

1367
01:01:12.103 --> 01:01:13.365
And...

1368
01:01:14.409 --> 01:01:15.976
crummy superhero movies.

1369
01:01:18.239 --> 01:01:20.938
Because of the success of Mask

1370
01:01:20.981 --> 01:01:23.941
we ended up producing
a very popular comic

1371
01:01:23.984 --> 01:01:25.377
at the time called Spawn.

1372
01:01:31.122 --> 01:01:32.645
That was Mark and my foray

1373
01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:34.821
to getting into

1374
01:01:35.126 --> 01:01:38.216
So. we leave ILM. boom.
Gone. you know?

1375
01:01:38.259 --> 01:01:39.608
Then we end up
hiring back the company

1376
01:01:39.652 --> 01:01:40.740
to do the visual effects.

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:04.068
No job.

1380
01:02:05.765 --> 01:02:07.985
So. I was asked
to do the visual effects

1381
01:02:08.028 --> 01:02:10.683
on The Hulkat ILM.

1382
01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:14.861

"How much more of this
do we have to take?"

After all these years...

1389
01:02:42.889 --> 01:02:44.021
I'’ll never forget it.

1390
01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:49.983
What made him brilliant
and a maverick

1391
01:02:50.027 --> 01:02:54.509
and a magnetic draw
for many of us

1392
01:02:55.293 --> 01:02:56.903
soon became something

1393
01:02:56.947 --> 01:02:59.688
that I felt
he needed to outgrow.

1394
01:03:02.604 --> 01:03:03.867
She just didn'’t like my antics.

1395
01:03:04.868 --> 01:03:05.999
She didn'’t like the drinking.

1396

Everybody who'’s with me changes.
right?

1397
01:03:10.699 --> 01:03:12.223
But they have to understand
that I don'’t change.

Always. Right or wrong.

1400

-Hm? What keeps me from--
-From changing.

1401
01:03:20.884 --> 01:03:22.450
What keeps me from changing?

1402
01:03:22.494 --> 01:03:24.975
Stupidity.

in the therapy sessions and...

1405
01:03:34.854 --> 01:03:36.987
the moment
we got home he was like.

"“Oh. fuck that shit. you know.
I'’m not gonna change. you know.

I'’m Spaz. you know."

1410
01:03:43.558 --> 01:03:45.952
And I kind of naively thought.

1411
01:03:45.996 --> 01:03:49.521
"Well. let'’s give it some time
and maybe he will change."

1412
01:03:53.568 --> 01:03:54.831
Give me a smile. honey.

01:03:54.874 --> 01:03:56.658
Hi.

1414
01:03:56.702 --> 01:03:58.269

right now. as usual.

1415
01:03:58.312 --> 01:03:59.879
And as soon as
Hannah discovers I'm gone.

1416
01:03:59.923 --> 01:04:01.576
then I will have
no extra hands--

1417
01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:03.317
I figure
it'’s a good thing if I have

1418
01:04:03.361 --> 01:04:04.884
the camera on.
then you won'’t yell at me.

1419
01:04:04.928 --> 01:04:06.407
I don'’t yell that much.

1420
01:04:06.451 --> 01:04:09.367
Excuse me.
Steve. please. okay?

1421
01:04:09.933 --> 01:04:11.586
Hi!

1422
01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:13.850
-Where are we going. sweetie?

1423
01:04:15.068 --> 01:04:16.853
Hey. look!

1424
01:04:16.896 --> 01:04:18.506
Visual effects supervisors
strapped to the fence!

1425
01:04:18.550 --> 01:04:20.117
Isn'’t that funny?

1426
01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.901
What? I'’m sorry.

1427
01:04:21.945 --> 01:04:23.337
-What-- what did I say?
-.

01:04:23.381 --> 01:04:24.295
What am I not allowed
to do now?

1429
01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:27.994
My parents split up
when I was three.

1430
01:04:29.517 --> 01:04:32.956
It kind of just became normal

1431
01:04:32.999 --> 01:04:34.740
that my parents
weren'’t together?

1432
01:04:34.783 --> 01:04:36.916
You know. my mom moved
to San Rafael.

1433
01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:38.613
my dad still had the house.

1434
01:04:41.312 --> 01:04:44.358
Steve decided to take
his career in a new direction.

1435
01:04:44.402 --> 01:04:46.012
so he was off feature films

1436
01:04:46.056 --> 01:04:47.971
and he was starting
to direct commercials.

1437
01:04:50.974 --> 01:04:52.801
Blockbuster campaign.

1438
01:04:52.845 --> 01:04:53.933
It was very successful.

1439
01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:57.981
We get approached by Disney.
who has a film called

1440
01:04:58.024 --> 01:05:01.593
The Wild. and so we end up
working on this movie.

1441
01:05:02.507 --> 01:05:05.162
2003. I was working
as an assistant editor

1442
01:05:05.205 --> 01:05:06.337
for the movie. The Wild.

1443
01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:07.816
Hello. Spaz!

1444
01:05:09.166 --> 01:05:12.386
I was just so in love
with Steve.

1445
01:05:12.996 --> 01:05:14.606
I really felt
like he was my soulmate.

1446
01:05:15.607 --> 01:05:19.393
And we made
a fantastic home together.

1447
01:05:19.437 --> 01:05:21.874
Okay. Christmas! 2005!

-Here. look. Hannah.
-Hi!

1451
01:05:26.183 --> 01:05:27.575
He put a lot of love

1452
01:05:27.619 --> 01:05:28.968
and craftsmanship
into that house.

1453
01:05:29.577 --> 01:05:31.014
It was warm and cozy.

1454
01:05:31.057 --> 01:05:33.190
unique. fun.
creative place to be.

1455
01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:36.715
We decided to get married
in the backyard.

1456
01:05:43.026 --> 01:05:45.985
Oh. yeah. baby!

1458
01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:53.036
When we got back
from Toronto after The Wild.

1459
01:05:53.079 --> 01:05:55.168
it was really hard
for those of us

1460
01:05:55.212 --> 01:05:56.691
on the film to get work

1461
01:05:56.735 --> 01:05:59.390
because the film
was so poorly received.

1462
01:05:59.433 --> 01:06:01.740
It was a drag. It was a drag.

1463
01:06:01.783 --> 01:06:03.916
And then. so. I went back
to commercials again.

1464
01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.831
Which one would be better.

1465

You know. either you'’re
the flavor of the month

or you'’re not.

1469
01:06:18.887 --> 01:06:20.585
It'’s just
a very fickle business.

1470
01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:26.112
Things just stalled for me.

1471

The commercials.
those dried up.

1472
01:06:32.814 --> 01:06:35.817
Nothing was really coming in
that was substantial enough.

1473
01:06:38.603 --> 01:06:39.865
The world had changed.

1474
01:06:41.649 --> 01:06:43.564
Sometimes. you'’re rewarded by.

1475
01:06:43.608 --> 01:06:47.264
uh. your longevity in--
in doing things

1476
01:06:47.307 --> 01:06:51.007
and. you know. those guys were
relatively new to the game.

1477
01:06:51.833 --> 01:06:55.446
And. uh.
they moved on very quickly

1478
01:06:55.489 --> 01:06:58.405
to wanting to direct
their own stuff.

1479
01:06:59.102 --> 01:07:02.235
So. they moved into
a whole 'nother zone

1480
01:07:02.279 --> 01:07:04.107
and then they kind of
didn'’t come back.

1481
01:07:06.761 --> 01:07:09.199
The problem
with this racket is that

1482
01:07:09.242 --> 01:07:10.504
if you'’re not...

1483
01:07:12.028 --> 01:07:14.769
in it. you--
Then you'’re not in it.

1484
01:07:17.076 --> 01:07:18.904
And he hadn'’t been
in the game for a long time.

1485
01:07:21.124 --> 01:07:22.429
You know.
you just get forgotten.

1488
01:07:35.616 --> 01:07:37.444
They don'’t want me back there
and I don'’t blame ''‘em.

1489
01:07:38.489 --> 01:07:39.794
I don'’t blame ''‘em at all.

1490
01:07:42.841 --> 01:07:44.451
If I'’d been more political...

1491
01:07:45.713 --> 01:07:47.628
I wouldn'’t be struggling
right now

1492
01:07:47.672 --> 01:07:50.022
to pay my God damn mortgage.

1493
01:07:59.162 --> 01:08:02.252
That rejection on a big stage...

1494
01:08:04.167 --> 01:08:07.996
I don'’t think I'll ever know

1495
01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:11.870
the true effects of what
that feels like for him.

1496
01:08:13.001 --> 01:08:16.701
All of those feelings. like.
just completely resurfaced

1497
01:08:16.744 --> 01:08:18.224
and he didn'’t know
how to handle it.

1498
01:08:22.141 --> 01:08:25.231
It was a snowball of...

1499
01:08:26.232 --> 01:08:29.061
bad memories. guilt.

1500
01:08:29.105 --> 01:08:31.672
lack of clarity
about certain things.

1501
01:08:34.284 --> 01:08:36.895
He just started drinking more.

1502
01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:41.160
It'’s a way to cover up

1503
01:08:41.204 --> 01:08:42.814
all the things
you feel shitty about.

1504
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:46.774
We were down at the pub
every single day.

1505
01:08:46.818 --> 01:08:48.863
drinking for about three hours
every night and then

1506
01:08:48.907 --> 01:08:52.867
that sort of grew into drinking
before we went to the pub.

1507
01:08:52.911 --> 01:08:55.348
and. um. just getting into.

1508
01:08:55.392 --> 01:08:58.395
just the worst knock down.
drag-out.

1509
01:08:58.438 --> 01:09:01.398
awful fights when we got home.

1510
01:09:03.051 --> 01:09:04.575
So. I finally
worked up the courage

1511
01:09:04.618 --> 01:09:05.837
to walk into an AA meeting.

1512
01:09:06.794 --> 01:09:10.058
You go. you keep going back.
and I got sober.

1513
01:09:10.102 --> 01:09:12.974
I stayed sober and. I'’m gonna
sound like an AA thumper.

1514
01:09:13.018 --> 01:09:14.933
but by the grace of God
I'’m still sober

1515
01:09:14.976 --> 01:09:17.196
and my marriage fell apart.

1516
01:09:19.546 --> 01:09:21.461
I knew
that if I didn'’t move out.

1517
01:09:21.505 --> 01:09:22.723
I wouldn'’t stay sober.

1518
01:09:23.811 --> 01:09:26.118
It'’s common where...

1519
01:09:26.771 --> 01:09:29.730
two alcoholics. one gets sober
and the other doesn'’t.

1520
01:09:31.079 --> 01:09:33.169
Well. I thought
we were doin'’ okay.

1521
01:09:41.655 --> 01:09:43.266
Ellen. please. I--

1522
01:09:52.362 --> 01:09:55.234
She left to light a fire

1523
01:09:55.278 --> 01:09:57.889
under my dad'’s ass. like. "“Hey.
you gotta clean up your act

1524
01:09:57.932 --> 01:09:59.238
or I'’m gone for good."

1525
01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:02.807
The train was goin'’
200 miles an hour.

1526
01:10:03.547 --> 01:10:05.505
I was either gonna go
into the wall with it.

1527
01:10:05.549 --> 01:10:07.159
or I was gonna get off

1528
01:10:07.638 --> 01:10:11.207
and hope that Steve could get
off before it-- it killed him.

1529
01:10:11.250 --> 01:10:13.426
So. I think she wanted
to scare him a little bit.

1530
01:10:15.036 --> 01:10:16.777
And it only made it worse.

1531
01:10:24.045 --> 01:10:25.873
Boredom is destructive.

1532
01:10:31.618 --> 01:10:33.229
I'’m just waiting
for another mission.

1533
01:10:35.796 --> 01:10:37.145
I don'’t have a mission anymore.

1534
01:10:42.673 --> 01:10:44.849
He completely isolated himself.

1535
01:10:46.067 --> 01:10:47.547
Lost a bunch of weight.

1536
01:10:48.809 --> 01:10:50.942
You know. he just looked sick.

1537
01:10:50.985 --> 01:10:52.160
It was awful.

1538
01:10:53.814 --> 01:10:56.817
He was waking up at noon.

1539
01:10:56.861 --> 01:10:57.949
Drinking.

1540
01:10:58.602 --> 01:11:00.168
Passing out at 4:00.

1541
01:11:00.821 --> 01:11:04.172
Waking up again at 7:00.

1542

1543
01:11:05.739 --> 01:11:07.393
Passing out at midnight.

1544
01:11:07.437 --> 01:11:10.353
