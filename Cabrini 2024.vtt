NEW YORK CITY.1889

4
00:01:54.122 --> 00:01:56.666
Please help me!. My mother is dying!

5
00:01:59.795 --> 00:02:02.254
My mother. she's dying!

6
00:02:03.924 --> 00:02:05.591
She's outside.

7
00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.843
My mother is dying. please help!

8
00:02:10.847 --> 00:02:14.392
She's dying! Help her! She's my mother. help her!

9
00:03:03.108 --> 00:03:05.443
Where are you taking her?

10
00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.180
I'm fine.

11
00:04:59.641 --> 00:05:01.725
It was just one of those e nights..

12
00:05:02.018 --> 00:05:04.520
Mother Cabrini. are you sure?

13
00:05:05.814 --> 00:05:07.147
I'm fine. Concetta.

14
00:05:08.066 --> 00:05:09.525
Thank you.

15
00:06:52.671 --> 00:06:53.754
Mother!

16
00:06:53.964 --> 00:06:56.924
A telegram! From the Vatican!

17
00:07:14.192 --> 00:07:16.735
I should leave for Rome at once.

18
00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:21.699
It is an invitation...

19
00:07:21.866 --> 00:07:23.283
not an approval.

20
00:08:44.657 --> 00:08:46.033
Mother Cabrini

21
00:08:46.868 --> 00:08:49.870
Your Eminence. thank you for this chance to state my case --

22
00:08:49.996 --> 00:08:54.458
In fact. you've already s stated your case eleven times.

23
00:08:58.004 --> 00:09:01.131
Your Eminence. an explosion of poverty is ripping through Asia..

24
00:09:01.257 --> 00:09:02.883
hitting children hardest. in China --

25
00:09:03.009 --> 00:09:04.676
Mother. this office has responded

26
00:09:04.803 --> 00:09:08.013
to your proposal. many times. to no avail.

27
00:09:09.349 --> 00:09:11.725
So we felt it necessary to deliver.

28
00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:14.436
that same response in person.

29
00:09:16.064 --> 00:09:16.730
Your Eminence. if I could --

30
00:09:16.856 --> 00:09:21.276
You're building an orphanage in Lombardy. are you not?

31
00:09:22.695 --> 00:09:24.029
Good.

32
00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.783
Then continue your good work there.

33
00:09:31.079 --> 00:09:33.580
Stay where you belong. Mother.

34
00:10:04.779 --> 00:10:06.321
Signora...

35
00:10:07.699 --> 00:10:10.033
Your daughter is very weak

36
00:10:10.368 --> 00:10:13.078
and will be so as long as she lives.

37
00:10:16.916 --> 00:10:19.543
She almost drowned in that river.

38
00:10:19.711 --> 00:10:24.047
Now her bed will be her life.

39
00:10:26.092 --> 00:10:30.804
That is where she belongs.

40
00:10:45.862 --> 00:10:47.362
Your Eminence

41
00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:51.909
Mother Cabrini

42
00:10:52.035 --> 00:10:53.243
This decision..

43
00:10:53.369 --> 00:10:55.412
is it yours or the Holy Father's?

44
00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.414
assure you there is no difference.

45
00:10:57.624 --> 00:10:59.208
If there is no difference..

46
00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:02.961
I'd like to hear it from His Holiness Himself.

47
00:11:03.588 --> 00:11:06.632
Or I'll be forced to keep writing letters.

48
00:11:33.785 --> 00:11:35.160
Your Holiness

49
00:11:40.959 --> 00:11:44.002
For one little woman. you make a lot of noise.

50
00:11:45.088 --> 00:11:46.462
Your Holiness.

51
00:11:46.755 --> 00:11:49.841
want to found a network of orphanages. first. throughout China --

52
00:11:50.009 --> 00:11:53.887
You have stated your case exhaustively.

53
00:11:57.392 --> 00:11:59.309
But I'm told you want to hear. the final verdict directly from me.

54
00:12:02.063 --> 00:12:05.524
Lombardy is the scope of your work.

55
00:12:07.567 --> 00:12:09.944
Now. His Eminence

56
00:12:10.071 --> 00:12:14.532
tells me that this is your first trip to Rome...

57
00:12:14.826 --> 00:12:18.787
your first trip out of Lombardy for that matter.

58
00:12:19.538 --> 00:12:21.832
Charming.

59
00:12:22.917 --> 00:12:26.503
I do encourage you to take a few days.

60
00:12:26.671 --> 00:12:29.298
visit the museum. see the sights --

61
00:12:29.632 --> 00:12:30.674
Is it because. I am a woman?

62
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.102
Is that why I must t limit my scope?

63
00:12:43.938 --> 00:12:48.150
There has never been an independent order of missionary women..

64
00:12:49.861 --> 00:12:53.697
Wasn't it Mary Magdalene who brought news of the Resurrection to the Apostles?

65
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:57.034
If God confided such a mission to a woman.

66
00:12:57.327 --> 00:12:59.119
why should He not confide in us?

67
00:12:59.244 --> 00:13:01.079
May I remind you that His Holiness has the power

68
00:13:01.204 --> 00:13:02.748
to censure or even disband --

69
00:13:02.874 --> 00:13:05.709
Just a moment. Silvio.

70
00:13:12.758 --> 00:13:16.302
Why China. Cabrini?

71
00:13:19.057 --> 00:13:21.516
Because we've forgotten the East.

72
00:13:22.602 --> 00:13:26.813
I shall start in Peking and move west..

73
00:13:27.482 --> 00:13:31.276
and create a body of charities that t will reach into Afghanistan. then into Persia --

74
00:13:31.402 --> 00:13:33.110
So...

75
00:13:33.278 --> 00:13:36.239
you intend to build...

76
00:13:36.615 --> 00:13:38.533
...a worldwide order!

77
00:13:41.078 --> 00:13:42.746
Your Holiness

78
00:13:43.664 --> 00:13:46.500
the world is too small for what I intend to do.

79
00:13:48.294 --> 00:13:50.295
See what I mean?

80
00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:56.760
And you have sufficient funds to..

81
00:13:56.885 --> 00:13:58.553
...conquer the world?

82
00:13:59.138 --> 00:14:00.471
Had I waited for sufficient funds.

83
00:14:00.598 --> 00:14:02.682
would have built nothing.

84
00:14:03.518 --> 00:14:08.522
Not my schools.. nor my orphanage in Co dog no.

85
00:14:09.065 --> 00:14:12.651
Begin the mission. and the means will come.

86
00:14:14.237 --> 00:14:15.821
Your Holiness.

87
00:14:16.697 --> 00:14:19.991
may I remind you of your next. appointment?

88
00:14:20.242 --> 00:14:21.952
Rearrange.

89
00:14:23.246 --> 00:14:25.831
I'm having tea with Cabrini.

90
00:14:39.803 --> 00:14:46.601
This morning. in an alley. I found the frozen body of a boy

91
00:14:46.978 --> 00:14:51.606
...with newspapers as his only blanket.

92
00:14:52.775 --> 00:15:00.407
We came to America believing the streets. were paved with gold....

93
00:15:00.533 --> 00:15:07.580
... Only to find they're paved with abandoned children.

94
00:15:11.334 --> 00:15:13.295
This box...

95
00:15:13.754 --> 00:15:16.297
..is a tomb of dreams. OC

96
00:15:16.924 --> 00:15:19.509
It's filled with letters from immigrants

97
00:15:19.635 --> 00:15:21.469
Italians from New York.

98
00:15:30.605 --> 00:15:32.688
Forgive me. Your Holiness.

99
00:15:34.442 --> 00:15:36.860
Why are you telling me this?

100
00:15:37.778 --> 00:15:39.738
They tell me that..

101
00:15:40.323 --> 00:15:43.325
you were rejected by. three different orders.

102
00:15:43.451 --> 00:15:46.369
Each time for "weakness of constitution.

103
00:15:48.498 --> 00:15:52.667
We can serve our weakness.

104
00:15:53.753 --> 00:15:56.004
or we can serve our purpose.

105
00:15:56.464 --> 00:15:58.006
Not both.

106
00:16:12.604 --> 00:16:15.857
If I made you the first woman

107
00:16:16.234 --> 00:16:19.319
...ever to lead an overseas mission

108
00:16:19.862 --> 00:16:23.740
the whole church would Io ok to you as proof...

109
00:16:24.784 --> 00:16:28.161
of what t women can..

110
00:16:28.411 --> 00:16:30.497
... or can not accomplish.

111
00:16:31.456 --> 00:16:32.874
You understand this?

112
00:16:44.803 --> 00:16:45.886
I will approve e your mission

113
00:16:46.138 --> 00:16:47.847
on one condition :

114
00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.810
Begin in the West.

115
00:16:52.435 --> 00:16:54.521
not the East.

116
00:16:56.064 --> 00:17:02.278
If the world is too small for what you intend to do...

117
00:17:02.697 --> 00:17:07.951
why does it matter where you begin?

118
00:17:25.011 --> 00:17:26.176
As women..

119
00:17:27.555 --> 00:17:31.558
...without men. we will be expected to fail.

120
00:17:32.226 --> 00:17:34.853
More than ever. we must trust in ourselves...

121
00:17:36.355 --> 00:17:38.481
and in the purpose of our mission.

122
00:17:39.692 --> 00:17:41.776
As we set sail

123
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:45.363
for America.

124
00:21:25.292 --> 00:21:31.089
Get out of there!

125
00:21:47.648 --> 00:21:49.357
This is not a place for you.

126
00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.485
Did you see three little girls? They came right past here.

127
00:21:53.153 --> 00:21:56.197
Look in the daylight you get killed at this hour.

128
00:21:57.157 --> 00:21:59.075
We should listen to her. Mother.

129
00:22:02.162 --> 00:22:04.455
Do you know where we can find a room nearby?

130
00:22:05.833 --> 00:22:08.543
For you? In Five Points?

131
00:22:09.128 --> 00:22:11.212
We need a place to sleep --

132
00:22:12.172 --> 00:22:13.715
just for tonight.

133
00:22:16.552 --> 00:22:17.760
I can't help.

134
00:22:18.429 --> 00:22:20.972
I beg you. we don't know where to go.

135
00:22:53.422 --> 00:22:54.756
Barricade the door.

136
00:22:55.174 --> 00:22:58.593
And unless you want to get beaten don't let Geno see you.

137
00:23:33.253 --> 00:23:35.505
Open the door!

138
00:23:36.382 --> 00:23:39.217
Nobody stays here for free!

139
00:23:39.342 --> 00:23:41.886
Open up!

140
00:23:43.847 --> 00:23:47.558
You think I care that you're nuns?

141
00:23:47.767 --> 00:23:50.478
If I catch you here again...

142
00:23:50.979 --> 00:23:53.648
I'll make you regret it.

143
00:24:05.953 --> 00:24:07.620
Oh my...

144
00:24:12.251 --> 00:24:13.251
Father Morelli?

145
00:24:23.178 --> 00:24:24.429
You're here.

146
00:24:26.015 --> 00:24:28.683
I knew this would come back to bite me.

147
00:24:29.184 --> 00:24:31.644
So. you did not receive. the letter from the Archbishop?

148
00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:33.479
The one I sen t t you?.

149
00:24:33.772 --> 00:24:35.857
No we didn't

150
00:24:39.486 --> 00:24:41.320
Well...

151
00:24:41.864 --> 00:24:44.198
your mission was denied. By the Archdiocese.

152
00:24:45.659 --> 00:24:46.743
Denied?

153
00:24:47.202 --> 00:24:48.410
What do you mean. denied?

154
00:24:49.621 --> 00:24:51.956
You really should see the Archbishop.

155
00:24:59.089 --> 00:25:01.966
Would you be kind enough to take us to our orphanage e first?

156
00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:55.144
We couldn't raise enough to keep it open.

157
00:25:55.729 --> 00:25:57.939
Not with the cost of the hospital.

158
00:26:03.612 --> 00:26:05.071
Enzo. Paolo! You again?!

159
00:26:05.197 --> 00:26:06.239
Get the hell out!! Go!

160
00:26:09.326 --> 00:26:11.118
No. don't go...

161
00:26:17.376 --> 00:26:21.754
As the twig is bent. so grows the tree.

162
00:26:21.964 --> 00:26:25.550
Even the older ones are still children.

163
00:26:29.513 --> 00:26:32.348
The Archbishop's Office is on 53rd.

164
00:26:33.225 --> 00:26:36.602
It will be a long walk before you find a streetcar.

165
00:35:18.792 --> 00:35:21.001
Stay where you belong. Mother.

166
00:35:46.903 --> 00:35:49.279
Mother...

167
00:36:00.667 --> 00:36:03.419
My name is Doctor Murphy.

168
00:36:04.921 --> 00:36:09.133
A couple good samaritans brought you here.

169
00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:27.943
Stay where you belong.

170
00:37:04.105 --> 00:37:06.982
Mother.

171
00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:09.610
your...

172
00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:14.031
lungs.

173
00:37:14.407 --> 00:37:16.200
they are...

174
00:38:59.721 --> 00:39:02.097
Where were you. I Mother?

175
00:39:02.432 --> 00:39:05.517
Are you okay. Mother?

176
00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:31.144
You have a lot of nerve coming back here.

177
00:40:31.312 --> 00:40:32.854
I'd like to speak to Vittoria.

178
00:40:32.981 --> 00:40:34.690
She's busy.

179
00:40:34.816 --> 00:40:36.566
Now leave.

180
00:40:38.653 --> 00:40:39.861
Get the hell out!

181
00:40:40.113 --> 00:40:41.405
Go! Go!

182
00:40:57.088 --> 00:40:59.506
Don't come back.

183
00:41:00.633 --> 00:41:03.844
Your pretty little habits won't protect you from him.

184
00:41:05.513 --> 00:41:08.432
Did he do this?

185
00:41:09.892 --> 00:41:13.562
I need your help to find those girls. Vittoria.

186
00:41:23.114 --> 00:41:25.407
Get your lamps.

187
00:42:47.865 --> 00:42:50.659
This was the door to my home.

188
00:43:13.099 --> 00:43:14.391
Put that a way!

189
00:43:14.684 --> 00:43:16.268
Mafia boy.

190
00:43:16.435 --> 00:43:18.770
They're just nuns.

191
00:43:32.076 --> 00:43:34.452
We'll take the bread.

192
00:43:38.583 --> 00:43:39.708
There you are!

193
00:43:39.834 --> 00:43:41.376
I've been worried about t you.

194
00:43:43.462 --> 00:43:44.963
Just give us the bread.

195
00:43:47.466 --> 00:43:50.010
Take the bread. what do you eat tonight?

196
00:43:51.429 --> 00:43:54.681
Come as our guests and you'll have...

197
00:43:56.267 --> 00:43:58.476
What is Sister Serafina making?

198
00:43:59.687 --> 00:44:02.189
Rigatoni and peach cro stata.

199
00:44:02.773 --> 00:44:04.232
Plus the bread.

200
00:44:04.358 --> 00:44:06.067
Or...

201
00:44:07.195 --> 00:44:08.695
We'll take the bread.

202
00:44:11.365 --> 00:44:13.116
But it's cro stata..

203
00:44:15.703 --> 00:44:17.537
The choice is yours.

204
00:44:23.336 --> 00:44:26.004
I've never had a crostata before.

205
00:44:28.049 --> 00:44:30.133
Sorry. but I'm going.

206
00:44:52.156 --> 00:44:54.282
This cro stata is great!

207
00:44:56.953 --> 00:44:59.454
We'll stay for a little while..

208
00:45:05.962 --> 00:45:08.964
...and what about your parents. Paolo?

209
00:45:09.715 --> 00:45:12.509
Papa killed himself.

210
00:45:13.511 --> 00:45:15.637
Mama died of typhus...

211
00:45:16.222 --> 00:45:18.181
..in a wheelbarrow.

212
00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:29.359
Go take a look.

213
00:45:29.652 --> 00:45:31.319
Look how handsome you are.

214
00:45:31.445 --> 00:45:33.905
Your mother would be so proud.

215
00:46:00.266 --> 00:46:02.725
You lying whore!

216
00:46:08.691 --> 00:46:11.484
You're gonna work a double shift to make it up!

217
00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:14.696
Let her go!

218
00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:17.574
Coward! He's just a kid.

219
00:46:17.824 --> 00:46:18.950
Let her go!

220
00:46:20.286 --> 00:46:21.202
Move!

221
00:46:22.413 --> 00:46:23.913
If you harm her. Mr. Geno...

222
00:46:24.665 --> 00:46:27.250
God's wrath shall descend upon you...

223
00:46:28.711 --> 00:46:32.088
...and it shall be better for you had you never been

224
00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:38.762
Mother.

225
00:46:39.764 --> 00:46:42.390
I'm going to repeat it to you one last time.

226
00:46:43.059 --> 00:46:44.100
Move to the side.

227
00:46:44.226 --> 00:46:46.477
I said let her go!

228
00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:50.732
Paolo...

229
00:46:51.317 --> 00:46:53.985
Give me the gun.

230
00:46:55.321 --> 00:46:57.614
Paolo. this is not the way we do things!.

231
00:46:59.992 --> 00:47:00.366
Put it down!

232
00:47:01.827 --> 00:47:04.287
Geno is leaving.

233
00:47:06.956 --> 00:47:08.458
Yeah.

234
00:47:08.834 --> 00:47:10.919
Listen to her. boy..

235
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:13.962
Lower the gun.

236
00:47:15.216 --> 00:47:15.673
Please.

237
00:47:32.941 --> 00:47:35.275
The pimp will be fine.

238
00:47:37.321 --> 00:47:38.988
So an orphan..

239
00:47:39.197 --> 00:47:40.448
shot a pimp.

240
00:47:40.908 --> 00:47:42.909
while you blocked the door

241
00:47:43.244 --> 00:47:46.537
...to keep a prostitute inside.

242
00:48:17.319 --> 00:48:19.154
Sit down. Paolo.

243
00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:01.571
That was the gun my papa used on himself.

244
00:49:22.259 --> 00:49:25.762
I removed the bullets but the gun is yours...

245
00:49:29.099 --> 00:49:33.686
The children and I. would like to know

246
00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:39.107
The choice is yours

247
00:53:34.136 --> 00:53:35.761
Ah. Vittoria!

248
00:53:36.137 --> 00:53:38.055
Where have you been?

249
00:53:44.313 --> 00:53:47.355
You'll pay for what you did to me!

250
00:53:48.192 --> 00:53:49.776
Enough! Geno!

251
00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:28.648
I'm a prostitute.

252
00:54:30.734 --> 00:54:34.779
Been one since was a girl.

253
00:54:44.164 --> 00:54:47.917
And now I have blood on my hands.

254
00:54:55.634 --> 00:55:01.889
There's not enough water in the world to make me clean.

255
00:55:17.239 --> 00:55:20.156
When I look at you. do you know what I see?

256
00:55:22.411 --> 00:55:24.704
I see a strong woman.

257
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.543
I see courage.

258
00:55:33.755 --> 00:55:36.632
I see it glowing all around I you.

259
00:55:39.344 --> 00:55:42.221
It takes a lot of courage...

260
00:55:42.472 --> 00:55:45.849
...to become who we're. meant to be.

261
00:55:50.772 --> 00:55:52.899
We have something in common.

262
00:55:55.694 --> 00:55:56.986
What?

263
00:55:58.238 --> 00:55:59.989
We are both survivors.

264
00:56:17.424 --> 00:56:21.092
We don't get to choose how we come into this world.

265
00:56:22.679 --> 00:56:26.057
But God gave us the freedom to choose...

266
00:56:27.267 --> 00:56:29.769
...how we live in it.

267
00:56:38.987 --> 00:56:40.695
There's a dead girl!

268
00:57:31.081 --> 00:57:34.000
Rats have it better than the children of Five Points.

269
00:57:34.459 --> 00:57:35.918
Rats.

270
00:57:36.545 --> 00:57:38.963
And no one cares.

271
00:57:48.306 --> 00:57:49.390
But do people know

272
00:57:49.516 --> 00:57:52.184
that rats have it better than the children of Five Points?

273
00:57:52.310 --> 00:57:54.729
Those people would never visit a sewer.

274
00:57:57.398 --> 00:58:00.359
Then we. should bring. the sewer to them.

275
01:03:47.624 --> 01:03:50.125
Give this to Dr.Murphy.

276
01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:52.795
He comes in Thursday and Saturday..

277
01:03:52.921 --> 01:03:55.214
Thank you. Mother. thank you!

278
01:03:56.758 --> 01:03:58.509
Send Giacomo my blessing.

279
01:04:02.222 --> 01:04:03.597
Mother. it's my nephew..

280
01:04:04.474 --> 01:04:07.267
The cops put him in jail but he did nothing. wrong.

281
01:16:03.192 --> 01:16:05.652
It's two in the morning.

282
01:16:41.355 --> 01:16:43.523
You should d rest more.

283
01:16:47.945 --> 01:16:51.156
You're dying. Why aren't you a afraid?

284
01:16:52.575 --> 01:16:54.909
Of course I'm afraid.

285
01:16:56.537 --> 01:16:59.622
That's why I'm out here digging.

286
01:17:03.419 --> 01:17:07.046
When I work it seems like....

287
01:17:08.174 --> 01:17:11.176
I'm stealing one more day of life.

288
01:17:14.805 --> 01:17:17.390
If I rest...

289
01:17:19.059 --> 01:17:22.145
that's when dying becomes..

290
01:17:23.355 --> 01:17:25.106
...very. very real.

291
01:17:33.157 --> 01:17:35.283
We just moved in

292
01:17:35.826 --> 01:17:38.328
to this huge. huge place..

293
01:17:39.705 --> 01:17:42.957
and we already barely fit.

294
01:17:43.792 --> 01:17:46.878
She just keeps bringing in more kids.

295
01:17:47.755 --> 01:17:49.339
She's crazy.

296
01:17:50.716 --> 01:17:53.718
We should help her somehow.

297
01:17:54.970 --> 01:17:56.721
Can you find us some work?

298
01:18:10.778 --> 01:18:11.611
Bro!

299
01:18:12.071 --> 01:18:13.446
They'll take us both.

300
01:18:13.697 --> 01:18:16.032
Twenty cents for the night shift!

301
01:18:16.408 --> 01:18:17.617
Perfect! What are we doing?

302
01:18:18.661 --> 01:18:20.662
Faster. boys! Faster!

303
01:18:20.913 --> 01:18:22.413
Keep that boiler hot!

304
01:18:22.706 --> 01:18:24.165
Or I toss you out!

305
01:18:33.509 --> 01:18:34.384
Go! Go!

306
01:18:34.510 --> 01:18:35.385
Now!

307
01:19:31.317 --> 01:19:32.859
Have you seen Enzo?

308
01:20:47.559 --> 01:20:49.435
I found Enzo!

309
01:22:08.682 --> 01:22:11.142
I You wrote to me..

310
01:22:11.810 --> 01:22:16.689
...that my girl is calling for me

311
01:22:18.150 --> 01:22:20.693
the one who left her behind..

312
01:22:21.195 --> 01:22:25.698
...is still far away.

313
01:22:26.617 --> 01:22:29.410
No. I won't be coming back to her.

314
01:22:29.870 --> 01:22:34.332
I'll stay gone

315
01:22:35.542 --> 01:22:43.299
and keep on working for us all..

316
01:22:43.884 --> 01:22:51.807
I have lost my home. my homeland and my honor...

317
01:22:53.310 --> 01:22:58.356
I'm butchers meat.

318
01:22:59.191 --> 01:23:05.071
I am an immigrant.

319
01:25:24.127 --> 01:25:27.213
We don't make loans.

320
01:25:27.339 --> 01:25:28.798
Then what about the Italian Senate?

321
01:25:29.091 --> 01:25:31.842
I can go to Rome.. I can sail tomorrow.

322
01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:35.805
I wouldn't sail to Rome to hear it.

323
01:35:48.626 --> 01:35:48.959
Sonk Mantan Piant

324
01:35:59.137 --> 01:36:01.138
Hello friends!

325
01:36:01.596 --> 01:36:02.389
Watch out!

326
01:36:02.598 --> 01:36:04.181
They are Americans!

327
01:37:47.245 --> 01:37:48.245
You coward!

328
01:44:12.087 --> 01:44:16.174
Do you t think the Archbishop will Iet me stay here without you?

329
01:44:18.135 --> 01:44:22.847
A hooker from Five Points?

330
01:44:26.310 --> 01:44:28.978
I'm going to Rome to fight. Sooc

331
01:44:29.939 --> 01:44:33.066
...with every last ounce of my strength.

332
01:45:48.100 --> 01:45:50.476
You fascinate me. Cabrini.

333
01:45:51.437 --> 01:45:56.649
I can't tell where your faith ends...

334
01:45:57.651 --> 01:46:00.403
100 and your ambition begins.

335
01:46:03.365 --> 01:46:05.742
I must agree with the Archbishop.

336
01:46:06.785 --> 01:46:11.080
This project is overly a ambitious.

337
01:46:13.626 --> 01:46:16.044
perhaps s unrealistic.

338
01:46:20.341 --> 01:46:22.967
Only after little David killed giant. t Goliath.

339
01:46:23.218 --> 01:46:25.762
did he become king.

340
01:46:28.014 --> 01:46:29.390
You intend to be a king?

341
01:46:30.225 --> 01:46:32.894
I intend to build an empire. Your I Holiness.

342
01:46:33.604 --> 01:46:36.147
An empire of hope.

343
01:46:41.695 --> 01:46:46.240
If you can prove. e that your. plan has any real chance...

344
01:46:46.408 --> 01:46:47.783
any at all.

345
01:46:49.161 --> 01:46:52.497
I could consider your request.

346
01:46:52.622 --> 01:46:55.541
In the meantime. I can not and will not...

347
01:46:56.502 --> 01:46:58.962
...override the Archbishop

348
01:47:28.158 --> 01:47:29.951
Senator...

349
01:47:30.077 --> 01:47:31.910
Sorry for the wait. Mother...

350
01:47:32.413 --> 01:47:34.497
We are late for a dinner.

351
01:47:35.039 --> 01:47:37.417
If you don't mind walking with us..

352
01:47:38.794 --> 01:47:41.504
The committee has reviewed your application.

353
01:47:41.671 --> 01:47:44.424
but has regretfully declined your loan..

354
01:47:44.591 --> 01:47:47.218
Senator. the project works perfectly. we can host --

355
01:47:47.385 --> 01:47:48.052
Good evening!

356
01:47:48.177 --> 01:47:49.429
So many children --

357
01:47:49.596 --> 01:47:51.097
Mother Cabrini

358
01:47:51.265 --> 01:47:54.434
the Senate does not even make I oans of that size.

359
01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:56.894
We do however wish you the best.

360
01:47:57.020 --> 01:47:59.731
The Senate has made its decision. my dear.

361
01:47:59.857 --> 01:48:01.524
There's nothing else you can do -

362
01:48:01.650 --> 01:48:02.900
But please. just take a look...

363
01:48:03.027 --> 01:48:04.651
Mother Cabrini!

364
01:48:05.195 --> 01:48:06.404
Enough!

365
01:48:07.031 --> 01:48:09.824
You've wandered into rooms..

366
01:48:10.492 --> 01:48:13.119
where you simply don't belong.

367
01:48:58.290 --> 01:49:00.124
Mother!

368
01:49:01.543 --> 01:49:03.127
Are you well?

369
01:49:03.253 --> 01:49:06.422
We're making. dinner. come. and eat something.

370
01:49:06.965 --> 01:49:09.300
need to rest

371
01:50:51.612 --> 01:50:54.780
The first time I saw you...

372
01:50:55.282 --> 01:50:56.824
you were marching t through

373
01:50:56.992 --> 01:50:58.951
the most dangerous alley in New York

374
01:51:00.871 --> 01:51:03.873
in your long black cape.

375
01:51:07.628 --> 01:51:10.463
You wore it like a suit of armor.

376
01:51:12.590 --> 01:51:16.552
Like nothing on Earth could stop you.

377
01:51:22.267 --> 01:51:24.936
I don't know what you're

378
01:51:25.646 --> 01:51:28.731
I don't know anything about the Pope or the Senate..

379
01:51:30.901 --> 01:51:34.362
But I know you're not supposed to stop.

380
01:51:35.364 --> 01:51:39.575
You said you'd fight with. every I ast ounce of your strength.

381
01:51:43.997 --> 01:51:47.250
You must put your armor on.

382
01:54:13.855 --> 01:54:14.939
Gentlemen!

383
01:54:16.733 --> 01:54:18.526
Open your-hearts

384
01:54:19.068 --> 01:54:20.319
to the refugee...

385
01:54:20.778 --> 01:54:24.156
to the Italian immigrant who traveled across the ocean!.

386
01:54:24.866 --> 01:54:25.782
In America.

387
01:54:26.326 --> 01:54:28.119
in the great city of New York.

388
01:54:29.079 --> 01:54:31.330
the life of an Italian immigrant --

389
01:54:31.456 --> 01:54:32.998
Officer! Escort her out now.

390
01:54:33.166 --> 01:54:33.999
Stop. my dear!

391
01:54:34.209 --> 01:54:35.126
Not one step further!

392
01:54:35.293 --> 01:54:37.753
Officer. you are to remove this woman.

393
01:54:39.339 --> 01:54:41.424
You did not permit me to speak earlier.

394
01:54:41.675 --> 01:54:42.882
Senator B odio.

395
01:54:43.592 --> 01:54:45.136
So I shall speak here.

396
01:54:45.762 --> 01:54:46.887
now!

397
01:54:47.055 --> 01:54:48.722
Throw her out!

398
01:54:49.516 --> 01:54:50.724
Because I speak for the immigrant --

399
01:54:50.933 --> 01:54:51.892
Only men are allowed to speak here!

400
01:54:52.018 --> 01:54:53.894
I speak for your countrymen..

401
01:54:54.062 --> 01:54:56.355
who wager everything on America.

402
01:54:57.065 --> 01:54:59.232
to discover what?

403
01:55:01.485 --> 01:55:04.112
'Even rats have it better!

404
01:55:04.780 --> 01:55:06.323
This is an outrage!

405
01:55:09.327 --> 01:55:11.662
speak for those little girls

406
01:55:11.997 --> 01:55:13.997
abandoned to the streets.

407
01:55:15.167 --> 01:55:19.128
Who somehow survive... only to become prostitutes.

408
01:55:20.964 --> 01:55:22.882
speak for families.

409
01:55:23.674 --> 01:55:25.342
stacked in tenements.

410
01:55:25.802 --> 01:55:27.386
For fathers.

411
01:55:27.929 --> 01:55:30.431
who die alone in gutters..

412
01:55:31.683 --> 01:55:33.600
like dogs.

413
01:55:35.896 --> 01:55:39.482
In one voice they tell you..

414
01:55:40.358 --> 01:55:42.609
they don't want your pity.

415
01:55:45.405 --> 01:55:47.239
For they are Italian.

416
01:55:48.241 --> 01:55:50.033
They are proud.

417
01:55:51.661 --> 01:55:52.745
But they also tell you --

418
01:55:52.913 --> 01:55:54.371
Enough! This is no place for a woman!

419
01:55:54.498 --> 01:56:00.377
--one small g gesture of love..

420
01:56:01.922 --> 01:56:04.423
can change everything.

421
01:56:05.175 --> 01:56:06.592
A word of hope.

422
01:56:06.718 --> 01:56:08.010
A touch.

423
01:56:09.221 --> 01:56:13.098
The medicine of a loving hand.

424
01:56:15.894 --> 01:56:18.646
These are the things that change the world.

425
01:56:21.274 --> 01:56:23.776
And in one voice they ask the great Senator B odio.

426
01:56:23.944 --> 01:56:25.860
...to hear their case.

427
01:56:27.697 --> 01:56:29.406
For at the hour of our death

428
01:56:29.865 --> 01:56:32.201
we will all be asked one question.

429
01:56:33.495 --> 01:56:35.120
What did we do for the poor?

430
01:56:35.455 --> 01:56:36.580
The sick?

431
01:56:36.831 --> 01:56:38.040
The homeless?

432
01:56:38.500 --> 01:56:41.877
For those stripped of dignity?

433
01:56:43.338 --> 01:56:45.548
What did we do?

434
01:56:50.845 --> 01:56:57.601
Such a loan. would be risky enough if made to a man.

435
01:56:58.103 --> 01:57:01.647
Isn't a building worth the same no matter who owns it?.

436
01:57:02.399 --> 01:57:03.899
If I fail

437
01:57:04.025 --> 01:57:07.236
I offer as collateral a prime piece of Manhattan real estate.

438
01:57:07.445 --> 01:57:09.321
all my holdings in Lombardy.

439
01:57:10.115 --> 01:57:12.074
and my property on the Hudson.

440
01:57:13.702 --> 01:57:15.953
In other words. gentlemen.

441
01:57:16.204 --> 01:57:19.248
if I fail. everything I have is yours.

442
01:57:20.959 --> 01:57:24.545
I am overriding his order but..

443
01:57:27.632 --> 01:57:29.925
it may cost you everything.

444
01:57:47.319 --> 01:57:50.613
That is how I learned to live in America..

445
01:57:51.489 --> 01:57:53.824
Thank you. Your Holiness.
