Hey?

21
00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:19.875
Sleeping Beauty.

22
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.000
Sorry.

23
00:01:22.375 --> 00:01:23.208
It's all right.

24
00:01:25.583 --> 00:01:26.416
Rough day?

25
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.250
Yeah.

26
00:01:33.416 --> 00:01:34.541
What are you studying?

27
00:01:35.916 --> 00:01:40.958
Nothing. Just contemporary sociological
theory and empirical corporate analysis.

28
00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:42.250
Sounds like fun.

29
00:01:44.083 --> 00:01:47.500
You know. when it comes
to corporate empirical analysis.

30
00:01:47.583 --> 00:01:49.708
the jokes just kinda write themselves.

31
00:01:50.083 --> 00:01:51.291
That's what you'd think.

32
00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:55.583
Can I get you anything else?

33
00:02:01.708 --> 00:02:02.541
Adam.

34
00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:04.125
Honey.

35
00:02:04.208 --> 00:02:06.125
-No.
-My break's over.

36
00:02:06.208 --> 00:02:07.708
-No.
-Yes.

37
00:02:07.875 --> 00:02:09.416
-No.
-Come on.

38
00:02:09.583 --> 00:02:11.791
-No!
-Dwight's gonna come looking for me.

39
00:02:13.541 --> 00:02:15.791
-You gotta stop working nights.
-I know.

40
00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:17.875
It's all they've got.

41
00:02:18.375 --> 00:02:21.166
We just have to keep our heads
above water until you finish school.

42
00:02:22.416 --> 00:02:24.625
It's not exactly what I had in mind
when we got married.

43
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.500
We made it this far. Right?

44
00:02:28.541 --> 00:02:30.250
We just have to see it through.

45
00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:33.125
Once you graduate school.
find a great job.

46
00:02:33.208 --> 00:02:34.750
I'll go back to grad school.

47
00:02:34.833 --> 00:02:37.541
And I can support you
in a manner in which you deserve.

48
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.166
You'd better.

49
00:02:49.083 --> 00:02:50.625
How did I get so lucky?

50
00:02:52.833 --> 00:02:53.833
I love you.

51
00:02:54.166 --> 00:02:55.291
I love you too.

52
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:07.458
Okay. let's go.
Dwight's gonna pitch a fit.

53
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:09.833
-All right.
-Out the door.

54
00:03:09.916 --> 00:03:11.416
I'm going.

55
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:16.625
Come on. you.

56
00:03:21.125 --> 00:03:23.583
- Where's the rest of it?
- There is no more money.

57
00:03:23.916 --> 00:03:25.958
-You have all the money.
-Give me the goddamned money!

58
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.416
- Shut the hell up!

59
00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:30.375
Shut up or you're dead people!

60
00:03:30.458 --> 00:03:32.125
-Don't mess with me!
-I got nothing else!

61
00:03:32.208 --> 00:03:34.541
I'm gonna put a cap in your ass old man!
Do not mess with me!

62
00:03:34.625 --> 00:03:36.583
-Don't shoot somebody else.
-Yeah. well she's next!

63
00:03:36.666 --> 00:03:39.166
- Please. we don't need trouble.
- Want me to do it?

64
00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:42.375
I'll do it right now!
I'll do you all. Right now!

65
00:03:43.875 --> 00:03:46.708
- Nobody else gotta get hurt.
- Then give me the money man!

66
00:03:46.791 --> 00:03:48.791
You don't have to hurt anybody else.
Take the money.

67
00:03:48.875 --> 00:03:51.875
- Hey. I told you. Shut up!
- There is no more money!

68
00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:52.875
Shut up!

69
00:03:54.875 --> 00:03:56.416
I'm done with you. you hear me?

70
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.375
- I'm done with both of you!
- I'm begging you!

71
00:03:59.625 --> 00:04:02.250
- Better pray old man!
- Give him all the money!

72
00:04:03.166 --> 00:04:06.875
I'll do it right now! You hear me?
Do not mess with me old man!

Thank you. Katie.

99
00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:13.958
My father planted that tree
on the day I was born.

100
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.541
eighty-eight years ago.

101
00:06:17.166 --> 00:06:18.208
It's beautiful.

102
00:06:18.708 --> 00:06:19.750
When I was a boy.

103
00:06:20.166 --> 00:06:23.333
people would say
my mother had a green thumb.

104
00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:26.375
Our garden was quite the show place.

105
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:27.833
Look at it now.

106
00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.291
I hired a fellow once to clean it up.

107
00:06:31.708 --> 00:06:33.291
This was a couple of years ago.

108
00:06:33.625 --> 00:06:34.916
Nice young man.

109
00:06:35.208 --> 00:06:36.791
Ethan something. I think.

110
00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.041
What happened to him?

111
00:06:38.125 --> 00:06:39.333
I don't know.

112
00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.750
He worked for a few weeks
and then stopped coming.

113
00:06:42.833 --> 00:06:44.083
Never saw him again.

114
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.041
Listen to me!

115
00:06:46.125 --> 00:06:48.750
-I sound like some silly old man.
-No!

116
00:06:48.833 --> 00:06:50.666
And today is our anniversary.

117
00:06:51.166 --> 00:06:53.916
-What?
-Yes. Four months ago today.

118
00:06:54.166 --> 00:06:56.000
the agency sent you to my door.

119
00:06:56.583 --> 00:07:00.291
my new caretaker. companion. and friend.

120
00:07:00.375 --> 00:07:01.208
And friend.

121
00:07:02.916 --> 00:07:03.916
Come on.

122
00:07:04.166 --> 00:07:05.875
It's time to take your medication.

123
00:07:10.083 --> 00:07:12.875
They're gonna schedule the last round
of interviews in a couple weeks.

124
00:07:14.125 --> 00:07:15.208
Couple of weeks?

125
00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.916
It's a big company.
Gotta jump through a lot of hoops.

126
00:07:21.916 --> 00:07:25.583
But... that kind of job. you know.
they have their own way of doing things.

127
00:07:25.666 --> 00:07:27.916
-I can't really push them.
-No. I know. I'm just--

128
00:07:29.375 --> 00:07:32.041
I'm a little stressed right now.

129
00:07:33.875 --> 00:07:36.708
You got another call
from the student loan people today.

130
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:38.291
God. they never quit.

131
00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:43.333
Well. you stopped taking classes
so we have to start paying off the loans.

132
00:07:43.416 --> 00:07:45.750
Otherwise. they'll turn it over
to a collection agency.

133
00:07:45.833 --> 00:07:48.916
-I know. yeah. I'm gonna call tomorrow.
-Great. And maybe you can call

134
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.083
the credit card people
while you're at it too.

135
00:07:51.166 --> 00:07:53.208
And the rep with our health insurance.

136
00:07:53.291 --> 00:07:55.791
Okay. Katie. I get it.
I'll figure something out. all right?

137
00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:56.750
Don't worry.

138
00:07:57.541 --> 00:07:59.375
I'm gonna get started on the dishes.

139
00:08:10.833 --> 00:08:12.666
-Katie.
-Don't tell me not to worry.

140
00:08:14.833 --> 00:08:15.666
I'm sorry.

141
00:08:24.625 --> 00:08:26.500
We're in serious trouble. Adam.

142
00:08:27.541 --> 00:08:30.708
-We need to get some money coming in soon.
-I'll find something.

143
00:08:30.791 --> 00:08:32.833
You've been saying that for months.

144
00:08:33.666 --> 00:08:36.583
It doesn't do us any good for me
to take some minimum wage job.

145
00:08:37.833 --> 00:08:41.416
That's why I quit school. so that
I can find something that pays enough.

146
00:08:42.041 --> 00:08:45.041
We can start chipping away at our debt.
I just need a little bit more time.

147
00:08:45.125 --> 00:08:47.500
We don't have any more time. Adam.

148
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.125
-Here. let me help you.
-No. it's fine. I've got it.

149
00:08:52.208 --> 00:08:53.625
I've got it. Adam. Adam!

150
00:08:58.666 --> 00:08:59.541
I'll clean it up.

151
00:09:08.208 --> 00:09:09.833
Why don't you ever listen to me?

152
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:13.083
Why did you go in there?

153
00:09:13.875 --> 00:09:15.791
I begged you. Adam.

154
00:09:17.125 --> 00:09:18.500
He could have killed you.

155
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.500
I could have lost you.
Can you imagine how that would have felt?

156
00:09:22.583 --> 00:09:23.416
Never...

157
00:09:23.916 --> 00:09:26.500
holding you again.
never hearing your voice.

158
00:09:30.791 --> 00:09:32.208
Nothing's right anymore.

159
00:09:33.375 --> 00:09:35.041
Babe. it's been four months.

160
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:38.833
No.

161
00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:40.583
No. I'm sorry. It's-- No.

162
00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:44.541
Where are you going?

163
00:09:45.041 --> 00:09:45.875
Out.

164
00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:01.166
Who's there?

165
00:10:27.333 --> 00:10:28.166
Leonard.

166
00:10:29.125 --> 00:10:29.958
Oh. it's you.

167
00:10:30.833 --> 00:10:31.666
Katie.

168
00:10:32.083 --> 00:10:34.416
-What are you doing out here?
-I thought you were asleep.

169
00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.750
I just... came here to think.

170
00:10:38.291 --> 00:10:39.458
What are you doing with that?

171
00:10:39.541 --> 00:10:41.416
I thought I heard someone
in the house again.

172
00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.041
-Again?
-I hear them walking

173
00:10:43.125 --> 00:10:44.791
and when I come down. they're always gone.

174
00:10:46.625 --> 00:10:48.208
There's no one in the house.

175
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:49.583
Here.

176
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.416
Are you all right?

177
00:10:53.541 --> 00:10:56.291
Why didn't you tell me
you had troubles with money?

178
00:10:57.041 --> 00:10:59.416
Oh. it's... not your problem.

179
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.250
-How much do you need?
-Leonard. no.

180
00:11:02.333 --> 00:11:03.916
We're friends. aren't we?

181
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:04.833
We are.

182
00:11:05.791 --> 00:11:07.208
Well. then let me help you.

183
00:11:07.541 --> 00:11:10.833
-I've got a little money set aside.
-I could never do that.

184
00:11:11.208 --> 00:11:13.541
A young couple starting out.

185
00:11:14.041 --> 00:11:18.041
The world is complicated enough.
You shouldn't have to worry about money.

186
00:11:18.125 --> 00:11:19.583
It comes with the territory.

187
00:11:20.166 --> 00:11:22.083
But to be in love.

188
00:11:22.333 --> 00:11:26.000
maybe have a family one day.
grow old together.

189
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.250
These are wonderful things.

190
00:11:28.625 --> 00:11:31.375
Things I wanted when I was a young man.

191
00:11:31.458 --> 00:11:36.208
And it would be nice to think.
that in some small way.

192
00:11:37.333 --> 00:11:39.500
I made a difference to someone.

193
00:11:40.375 --> 00:11:42.333
Maybe to you and your young man.

194
00:11:48.125 --> 00:11:49.375
He needs a job.

195
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:03.250
I'll tell Leonard you're here.

196
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:09.208
It'll be fine.

197
00:12:10.166 --> 00:12:11.333
Just talk to him.

198
00:12:12.708 --> 00:12:13.541
Okay.

199
00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.666
Lorazepam. point five milligrams.

200
00:12:23.125 --> 00:12:23.958
Yes.

201
00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:29.125
I can pick it up after five probably...

202
00:12:29.208 --> 00:12:31.625
Local tycoons who built it...

203
00:12:31.708 --> 00:12:33.125
Thank you. Bye.

204
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:37.000
... so they could get their family away
from the smell of the stock yards.

205
00:12:37.583 --> 00:12:39.875
But their children grew up and...

206
00:12:49.541 --> 00:12:50.958
-Hi. how are you doing?
-Hi.

207
00:12:51.041 --> 00:12:54.083
So sorry to bother you.
My name is Mickey Hayden.

208
00:12:54.583 --> 00:12:55.500
Real estate agent.

209
00:12:55.583 --> 00:12:57.916
Believe me. I know
how this is gonna sound. okay.

210
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.666
but I have this new client.
just got transferred to the city for work.

211
00:13:02.041 --> 00:13:05.375
He's got a big family.
couple of dogs. the whole nine yards.

212
00:13:05.458 --> 00:13:09.083
It's adorable. Anyway.
he's looking for just the right home.

213
00:13:09.375 --> 00:13:12.250
And yesterday. he was driving
through the neighborhood here.

214
00:13:12.583 --> 00:13:14.541
took one look at this amazing house--

215
00:13:14.625 --> 00:13:16.166
Oh. this house isn't for sale.

216
00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:18.166
Are you the owner?

217
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:22.166
No. but. trust me.
you'd be wasting your time.

218
00:13:22.541 --> 00:13:24.625
He's lived here his entire life.

219
00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:25.958
He's not going anywhere.

220
00:13:26.625 --> 00:13:29.041
My client is seriously motivated.

221
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:32.166
Yeah. I don't know what to tell you.

222
00:13:32.541 --> 00:13:33.541
I'm sorry.

223
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:35.333
But good luck.

224
00:13:35.833 --> 00:13:36.958
Oh. wait. Look...

225
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:39.625
could you do me a favor. Ms...

226
00:13:41.333 --> 00:13:42.208
Katie.

227
00:13:42.416 --> 00:13:43.250
Katie.

228
00:13:43.708 --> 00:13:48.041
If by some crazy chance
he happens to change his mind.

229
00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.333
could you have him call me?

230
00:13:50.416 --> 00:13:52.500
That's not gonna happen. but sure.

231
00:13:52.916 --> 00:13:55.000
I appreciate that. thank you.

232
00:13:55.083 --> 00:13:55.916
Yeah.

233
00:13:56.166 --> 00:13:57.250
You have a great day.

234
00:13:57.791 --> 00:13:58.666
You too.

235
00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:11.875
-  They want to make an offer?
-  Sounds like it.

236
00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.750
They don't even care
what the yard looks like?

237
00:14:14.916 --> 00:14:17.500
I'm sure it'll look better
after you start work on it tomorrow.

238
00:14:19.583 --> 00:14:21.083
Place must be worth a fortune.

239
00:14:22.458 --> 00:14:23.333
Mm-hmm.

240
00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:25.583
Must be nice.

241
00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:49.333
Leonard?

242
00:15:08.666 --> 00:15:10.791
There you are. I've got your breakfast.

243
00:15:10.875 --> 00:15:13.333
-Thank you. Katie.
-Of course.

244
00:15:16.333 --> 00:15:18.166
My parents used to play this.

245
00:15:19.416 --> 00:15:20.375
It's lovely.

246
00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:24.833
Sit with me a moment.

247
00:15:26.041 --> 00:15:26.916
Sure.

248
00:16:02.625 --> 00:16:03.666
Did you lock the back door?

249
00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:04.583
-Yep.
-Good.

250
00:16:06.291 --> 00:16:10.458
So. when do I get the grand tour
and see how the other half lives?

251
00:16:10.666 --> 00:16:11.875
The time will come.

252
00:16:12.208 --> 00:16:13.416
What about that Buick?

253
00:16:14.041 --> 00:16:15.791
Looks like it's been parked there
for a while.

254
00:16:15.875 --> 00:16:19.208
-Does Leonard even drive it anymore?
-No. not since I've known him.

255
00:16:19.458 --> 00:16:21.375
I don't think he's driven it in years.

256
00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:38.125
I was reading online

257
00:16:39.041 --> 00:16:43.000
about this medical school with a really
great program in pediatric surgery.

258
00:16:45.125 --> 00:16:46.458
I could send you the link.

259
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:00.958
I love you.

260
00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:02.583
I love you too.

261
00:17:21.125 --> 00:17:23.541
-Mr. Calvern.
-Hello Katie. how are you today?

262
00:17:23.625 --> 00:17:26.125
I'm fine. thank you.
We weren't expecting you.

263
00:17:26.375 --> 00:17:27.916
Oh. is-- Is this a good time?

264
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.416
Sure. yeah. Come in.

265
00:17:33.208 --> 00:17:36.791
Leonard.
Mr. Calvern is here from the agency.

266
00:17:36.875 --> 00:17:38.583
Good morning. Mr. Wellsley.

267
00:17:38.666 --> 00:17:43.208
Mr. Calvern. how nice to see you again.
Come to check up on us?

268
00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:44.458
No.

269
00:17:44.541 --> 00:17:46.416
Not at all. I happened
to be in the neighborhood

270
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.875
and I thought I'd drop in. say hello.

271
00:17:49.166 --> 00:17:51.000
I thought we might have a chat.

272
00:17:51.083 --> 00:17:53.708
Yeah. I'll get lunch started.
Just call me if you need anything.

273
00:17:53.791 --> 00:17:55.083
-Thank you. Katie.
-Yeah.

274
00:17:55.166 --> 00:17:56.958
-Come back here.
-Oh. great.

275
00:17:57.416 --> 00:17:59.125
This is my favorite room.

276
00:17:59.875 --> 00:18:01.666
-What's for lunch?
-Adam!

277
00:18:02.083 --> 00:18:05.208
-You're all jumpy in the big scary house?
-You can't be in here.

278
00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.458
There's a guy from the agency.
and he's doing a drop-in.

279
00:18:08.791 --> 00:18:10.541
Oh. Well. you're doing a great job.

280
00:18:11.583 --> 00:18:14.416
Yeah. and he sees my husband working here.
That won't look a little funny?

281
00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:17.041
Oh. you mean like maybe we're just...
messing around?

282
00:18:17.125 --> 00:18:18.666
I don't know-- Stop it.

283
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:19.750
-Come on.
-Okay.

284
00:18:26.916 --> 00:18:28.166
But I'm hungry.

285
00:18:28.666 --> 00:18:31.791
- So. how is everything?
- Love you.

286
00:18:31.875 --> 00:18:35.375
Well... that's a question
that people ask all the time

287
00:18:35.458 --> 00:18:37.125
to people of my age.

288
00:18:37.666 --> 00:18:41.125
Well. Mr. Wellsley seems
in good spirits.

289
00:18:41.208 --> 00:18:43.208
You two have gotten very close.

290
00:18:43.291 --> 00:18:45.958
Yeah. he's an interesting man.
I like talking to him.

291
00:18:46.041 --> 00:18:47.333
You hired a gardener?

292
00:18:48.166 --> 00:18:50.291
Part-time. yeah. It was Leonard's idea.

293
00:18:50.541 --> 00:18:53.250
Okay. Well. I'll see you soon. Katie.

294
00:18:53.333 --> 00:18:54.166
Yeah.

295
00:19:18.291 --> 00:19:22.625
I can't say I especially care
for our Mr. Calvern.

296
00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:26.208
-Why not?
-He keeps asking all these questions.

297
00:19:26.416 --> 00:19:29.250
like he's trying to trip me up
to make you look bad.

298
00:19:29.666 --> 00:19:32.958
He's just making sure
I'm taking good care of you. That's all.

299
00:19:33.041 --> 00:19:36.541
Well. don't you worry. I told him
I couldn't get along without you.

300
00:19:36.875 --> 00:19:37.833
Speaking of which...

301
00:19:38.916 --> 00:19:39.750
Thank you.

302
00:19:57.708 --> 00:19:58.708
Adam?

303
00:19:58.916 --> 00:19:59.750
Look.

304
00:20:00.666 --> 00:20:01.500
Look.

305
00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:06.083
Whoa.

306
00:20:07.125 --> 00:20:08.375
Did you get a raise?

307
00:20:09.083 --> 00:20:10.000
Oh. no.

308
00:20:11.375 --> 00:20:12.208
What?

309
00:20:13.291 --> 00:20:15.375
I said something to Leonard...

310
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.416
about us.

311
00:20:17.916 --> 00:20:18.875
What do you mean?

312
00:20:19.333 --> 00:20:20.666
I told him we're broke.

313
00:20:23.208 --> 00:20:24.250
Christ. Katie.

314
00:20:26.125 --> 00:20:28.875
-It's a little personal. don't you think?
-I was upset.

315
00:20:29.333 --> 00:20:32.208
You were being a jerk.
and I needed to talk to somebody.

316
00:20:32.291 --> 00:20:34.500
-When was I being a jerk?
-That's not the point.

317
00:20:34.583 --> 00:20:37.416
Leonard wanted to help.
so he offered to give us money.

318
00:20:37.708 --> 00:20:38.666
And you said yes?

319
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:40.875
No. I asked him to give you a job instead.

320
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:47.291
Well. maybe this check is for both of us.
Like he added an extra zero.

321
00:20:51.041 --> 00:20:52.000
It's too much.

322
00:20:56.541 --> 00:20:57.458
What are you doing?

323
00:20:57.583 --> 00:21:01.333
I'm calling him. We can't keep this.
He has to write us another check.

324
00:21:01.416 --> 00:21:04.166
By the time we drive back to the house
and he writes another check.

325
00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:05.583
the bank will be closed.

326
00:21:06.166 --> 00:21:09.791
If we don't pay these bills by today.
Katie. they'll be kicking in our door.

327
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:12.708
He's not answering.

328
00:21:13.791 --> 00:21:15.166
All right. look.

329
00:21:15.958 --> 00:21:17.041
why don't we...

330
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:18.708
deposit the check--

331
00:21:18.791 --> 00:21:21.500
-We cannot take this money.
-It's just for tonight.

332
00:21:22.166 --> 00:21:24.125
Pay the bills.
Talk to Leonard in the morning.

333
00:21:24.208 --> 00:21:26.000
You can write him a check
for the difference.

334
00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:31.916
It's one night. Katie.

335
00:21:46.041 --> 00:21:47.541
What's Leonard's deal. anyway?

336
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.208
What's he doing in that
big house all by himself?

337
00:21:51.625 --> 00:21:53.666
His parents passed away like...

338
00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:55.750
thirty years ago.

339
00:21:55.833 --> 00:21:58.000
He's an only child. Never married.

340
00:21:59.625 --> 00:22:00.500
No other family?

341
00:22:01.166 --> 00:22:02.000
No.

342
00:22:02.833 --> 00:22:03.791
It must be tough...

343
00:22:04.583 --> 00:22:06.166
just being all alone like that.

344
00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:07.333
Yeah.

345
00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:10.375
He's such a good guy.

346
00:22:14.333 --> 00:22:15.166
Yeah.

347
00:22:31.791 --> 00:22:33.000
-Love you.
-I love you too.

348
00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:13.333
Leonard?

349
00:23:30.208 --> 00:23:31.041
Leonard?

350
00:23:36.583 --> 00:23:37.416
Leonard?

351
00:24:47.458 --> 00:24:48.291
I'm sorry.

352
00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.250
What was he doing up here in the attic?

353
00:24:55.875 --> 00:24:57.750
He liked to come up here sometimes.

354
00:24:59.166 --> 00:25:00.500
Listen to old records.

355
00:25:15.375 --> 00:25:17.500
What would he need to keep locked up here?

356
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:29.583
Adam.

357
00:25:31.291 --> 00:25:32.125
We shouldn't.

358
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:35.583
I'm just gonna look.

359
00:25:44.375 --> 00:25:45.208
Katie.

360
00:25:45.708 --> 00:25:46.541
Come look.

361
00:25:58.041 --> 00:25:59.125
Who's she?

362
00:26:05.916 --> 00:26:06.750
I don't know.

363
00:26:11.166 --> 00:26:12.291
All these letters.

364
00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:20.041
Didn't you say that Leonard never married?

365
00:26:27.666 --> 00:26:28.875
We shouldn't do this.

366
00:26:29.916 --> 00:26:30.750
All right.

367
00:26:30.833 --> 00:26:31.916
Let's go.

368
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.291
We need to call 911.

369
00:26:36.791 --> 00:26:38.125
Holy!

370
00:26:40.458 --> 00:26:41.291
What?

371
00:26:46.375 --> 00:26:47.500
That's a lot of money.

372
00:26:51.833 --> 00:26:54.291
You said he lived alone
here for how many years?

373
00:26:55.166 --> 00:26:56.666
People get a little eccentric.

374
00:26:57.375 --> 00:26:59.333
Start by putting some aside.
little by little.

375
00:26:59.416 --> 00:27:00.541
and before you know it...

376
00:27:05.291 --> 00:27:07.000
He doesn't have any family.

377
00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:18.875
It'll end up in a police locker somewhere.

378
00:27:21.666 --> 00:27:22.791
Government'll take it.

379
00:27:24.333 --> 00:27:26.750
Why should we let it get caught up
in the system like that?

380
00:27:27.416 --> 00:27:29.500
When it could actually do some real good.

381
00:27:31.333 --> 00:27:34.583
I mean. you said yourself how much
he cared about you. He wanted to help.

382
00:27:36.166 --> 00:27:37.000
He did.

383
00:27:38.333 --> 00:27:39.541
Well. there you have it.

384
00:27:40.166 --> 00:27:41.583
A way for him to help you.

385
00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:44.250
Help us.

386
00:27:50.833 --> 00:27:52.416
We would have to be careful.

387
00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:55.833
Yeah. We will.

388
00:27:56.541 --> 00:27:57.375
Adam.

389
00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.458
-Yeah.
-Promise me.

390
00:28:02.625 --> 00:28:03.458
I promise.

391
00:28:16.041 --> 00:28:18.375
So how long did you work
for Mr. Wellsley?

392
00:28:19.208 --> 00:28:21.208
About four and a half months.

393
00:28:22.208 --> 00:28:23.416
And you lived here too?

394
00:28:24.458 --> 00:28:27.958
Leonard stayed here alone at night.
That's how he wanted it.

395
00:28:28.083 --> 00:28:29.666
He could still get around okay.

396
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.500
When was the last time you saw him?

397
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.291
Yesterday afternoon.

398
00:28:35.958 --> 00:28:38.708
We left a little early
to go to the bank around...

399
00:28:38.791 --> 00:28:39.625
Around 4:30.

400
00:28:39.708 --> 00:28:42.458
And you worked here too. Mr. Kettner?

401
00:28:42.541 --> 00:28:45.500
Just a couple weeks.
I was doing some yard work for Leonard.

402
00:28:46.833 --> 00:28:47.666
We're married.

403
00:28:48.291 --> 00:28:49.250
I kind of got that.

404
00:28:49.791 --> 00:28:50.625
Yeah.

405
00:28:54.916 --> 00:28:59.333
So how was Mr. Wellsley doing?
Was he having any health issues recently?

406
00:28:59.583 --> 00:29:01.750
No. He's been fine. I mean...

407
00:29:02.625 --> 00:29:05.875
he's 88.
so he took a lot of medication but...

408
00:29:07.458 --> 00:29:09.625
but he wouldn't have complained about it
anyway.

409
00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:11.625
He wasn't like that.

410
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:18.083
Well. I'm gonna need to get some
contact information. next of kin.

411
00:29:20.125 --> 00:29:21.541
He doesn't have any family.

412
00:29:21.625 --> 00:29:22.458
No?

413
00:29:23.666 --> 00:29:24.500
No.

414
00:29:28.958 --> 00:29:30.208
I'm sorry for your loss.

415
00:29:31.083 --> 00:29:32.416
If you have any questions...

416
00:29:33.583 --> 00:29:34.625
just give me a call.

417
00:29:38.166 --> 00:29:41.125
Leonard once told me
he wanted to be cremated.

418
00:29:41.916 --> 00:29:44.375
He wanted his ashes spread in the garden.

419
00:29:47.833 --> 00:29:49.041
Let me get back to you.

420
00:29:49.541 --> 00:29:50.375
Okay.

421
00:29:50.458 --> 00:29:51.291
Thank you.

422
00:30:30.333 --> 00:30:31.375
Where are you going?

423
00:30:32.541 --> 00:30:36.125
I have to talk to Mr. Calvern
to get my name back on the list.

424
00:30:36.208 --> 00:30:37.041
What list?

425
00:30:37.291 --> 00:30:38.416
At the agency.

426
00:30:39.291 --> 00:30:40.375
For another position.

427
00:30:41.333 --> 00:30:42.166
Why?

428
00:30:43.541 --> 00:30:45.375
Because that's what I should do.

429
00:30:45.916 --> 00:30:47.583
now that I don't have a job.

430
00:30:49.125 --> 00:30:51.125
If you don't hear back
about that job soon.

431
00:30:51.208 --> 00:30:52.875
maybe you should start looking again too.

432
00:30:53.125 --> 00:30:54.750
All right. I will.

433
00:30:56.833 --> 00:30:58.166
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.

434
00:31:33.416 --> 00:31:36.583
Katie. I am so sorry.
The two of you were so close.

435
00:31:36.666 --> 00:31:38.583
I can't imagine what a shock it was.

436
00:31:39.583 --> 00:31:41.166
If there's anything I can do...

437
00:31:41.416 --> 00:31:44.458
I would like to get another
assignment as soon as possible.

438
00:31:44.541 --> 00:31:47.791
-Oh. okay. Well. let's talk in my office.
-Okay.

439
00:32:00.583 --> 00:32:01.583
UNKNOWN

440
00:32:03.458 --> 00:32:04.291
Hello?

441
00:32:05.791 --> 00:32:06.625
Speaking.

442
00:32:08.916 --> 00:32:10.708
Oh! Hi. yeah.

443
00:32:11.833 --> 00:32:14.125
I agree. I thought
the interview went very--

444
00:32:17.333 --> 00:32:18.166
I see.

445
00:32:20.333 --> 00:32:22.458
Yeah. no. I completely understand.

446
00:32:23.333 --> 00:32:24.458
Thank you for calling.

447
00:32:25.666 --> 00:32:26.583
Yeah. you too.

448
00:32:30.583 --> 00:32:33.833
Katie. I assumed you knew.
I can't put you back to work.

449
00:32:33.916 --> 00:32:36.875
not until the police finish
their investigation.

450
00:32:37.625 --> 00:32:38.708
Investigation?

451
00:32:38.791 --> 00:32:43.166
Well. yes. when a client expires
under the supervision of an employee.

452
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:47.583
we cooperate with the authorities
to be absolutely certain that there was...

453
00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.833
you know. how would it look
to a potential client

454
00:32:51.916 --> 00:32:53.875
that there was even any hint of--

455
00:32:54.125 --> 00:32:58.750
Wait. you think I had something
to do with what happened to Leonard?

456
00:32:58.833 --> 00:33:00.625
God. no. No. of course not.

457
00:33:00.708 --> 00:33:02.000
No. This is...

458
00:33:02.583 --> 00:33:05.041
I'm sorry. Katie. This is company policy.

459
00:33:05.458 --> 00:33:09.000
There's nothing I can do until the police
officially close their investigation.

460
00:33:09.083 --> 00:33:11.083
So. how long is this gonna take?

461
00:33:12.833 --> 00:33:13.708
Yeah. I--

462
00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:15.208
I wish I knew.

463
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:16.583
Hello?

464
00:35:04.625 --> 00:35:05.458
Hey.

465
00:35:05.541 --> 00:35:06.958
<i>What were you thinking?</i>

466
00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:11.333
You can't just come in here like this.
like we still belong here.

467
00:35:11.416 --> 00:35:14.958
Excuse me. I'm bleeding right now.
What do you want from me?

468
00:35:15.583 --> 00:35:17.500
We said we'd be careful. Adam!

469
00:35:18.333 --> 00:35:21.041
I asked you and you promised me.

470
00:35:21.583 --> 00:35:24.125
-You promised.
-All right. Okay!

471
00:35:24.208 --> 00:35:25.166
Look. I--

472
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:26.833
I'm sorry.

473
00:35:28.041 --> 00:35:30.958
But if I wasn't here.
I think that money would be gone.

474
00:35:31.041 --> 00:35:32.666
How could anyone know about the money?

475
00:35:33.083 --> 00:35:36.041
-It's Leonard's. He kept it hidden.
-Why else would they be here. Katie?

476
00:35:39.041 --> 00:35:40.375
You didn't see who it was?

477
00:35:40.458 --> 00:35:41.833
No. they came up behind me.

478
00:35:43.625 --> 00:35:45.583
They couldn't have known you were here.

479
00:35:46.416 --> 00:35:48.125
They wouldn't have busted in like that.

480
00:35:48.208 --> 00:35:50.625
I heard the glass break.
That's why I came down.

481
00:35:51.041 --> 00:35:52.416
The back door was already open.

482
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:55.041
And you didn't think
maybe that was a bad sign.

483
00:35:55.125 --> 00:35:56.750
that you should get out?

484
00:35:56.833 --> 00:35:58.166
No. I didn't have time to think.

485
00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:01.208
The next thing I know. I was waking up
to the sound of my phone ringing.

486
00:36:01.291 --> 00:36:03.958
How could you do this. Adam?
This never should have happened.

487
00:36:04.041 --> 00:36:05.416
You never should have been here.

488
00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:07.583
-That's not the point!
-Then what's the point?

489
00:36:07.666 --> 00:36:11.250
-Almost a hundred grand! That's the point.
-You're always trying to justify your--

490
00:36:14.208 --> 00:36:15.166
You counted it?

491
00:36:18.166 --> 00:36:20.750
I counted to 92.000. and there was more.

492
00:36:29.458 --> 00:36:31.958
Then she calls me to say how sorry she is

493
00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:35.750
that the hiring committee
decided to go another way.

494
00:36:36.583 --> 00:36:38.083
Whatever the hell that means.

495
00:36:38.208 --> 00:36:39.625
I don't even know...

496
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:42.333
They're all just such assholes.

497
00:36:42.916 --> 00:36:44.333
I'm just sick of being poor.

498
00:36:49.625 --> 00:36:50.750
Who was it. Adam?

499
00:36:51.208 --> 00:36:52.083
Who got in here?

500
00:36:54.833 --> 00:36:57.750
Maybe somebody
who did some work on the house?

501
00:36:58.708 --> 00:37:02.375
-Sometime before you started.
-Leonard talked about hiring a gardener.

502
00:37:03.125 --> 00:37:04.791
but that was a couple of years ago.

503
00:37:07.416 --> 00:37:10.833
Well. whoever it was.
I don't think it was a coincidence.

504
00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:13.708
They must have known
that Leonard had passed away.

505
00:37:13.791 --> 00:37:15.791
And figured the house would be empty.

506
00:37:18.208 --> 00:37:19.041
Yeah.

507
00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:21.416
But maybe you're right.

508
00:37:22.208 --> 00:37:23.875
Maybe they didn't know about the money.

509
00:37:23.958 --> 00:37:26.166
They probably just wanted
to get in and get out.

510
00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:28.208
Just grab whatever they can get away with.

511
00:37:30.541 --> 00:37:31.791
What if they come back?

512
00:37:36.375 --> 00:37:37.791
All right. right this way.

513
00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:49.125
There you go.

514
00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:51.458
Just ring when you're ready.

515
00:37:51.541 --> 00:37:52.375
Thank you.

516
00:38:07.791 --> 00:38:08.625
Babe.

517
00:38:09.583 --> 00:38:10.541
Dinner's on me.

518
00:38:11.083 --> 00:38:11.958
All right.

519
00:38:39.791 --> 00:38:41.541

I was just making you coffee.

529
00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:40.500
<i>Ms. Franklin. this is Detective Chesler.</i>
<i>We spoke at Mr. Wellsley's house.</i>

530
00:39:41.375 --> 00:39:43.583
<i>Would you give me a call</i>

531

<i>You have the number. Thanks.</i>

532
00:39:55.333 --> 00:39:57.791
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Thanks for coming in.

533
00:39:57.875 --> 00:39:59.625
Detective. Is there a problem?

534
00:39:59.958 --> 00:40:01.416
Why don't we talk back here?

535
00:40:04.708 --> 00:40:06.875
Did Mr. Wellsley ever mention a will?

536
00:40:07.208 --> 00:40:08.041
No.

537
00:40:08.166 --> 00:40:09.166
And no family?

538
00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:11.250
He was all alone.

539
00:40:11.708 --> 00:40:13.375
Well. something like this.

540
00:40:14.083 --> 00:40:19.166
the rich old man. living alone. no heirs.
We just have to cross all of our t's.

541
00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:21.333
I'm sorry. Detective.

542
00:40:22.291 --> 00:40:23.791
I don't...

543
00:40:24.583 --> 00:40:25.666
What is this about?

544
00:40:26.666 --> 00:40:30.083
Well. you said that
Mr. Wellsley asked to be cremated.

545
00:40:30.166 --> 00:40:33.375
So I'm assuming that you
want to honor his request.

546
00:40:35.416 --> 00:40:36.250
Yes.

547
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Yes. we do.

548
00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.541
Without a family and no will.

549
00:40:41.791 --> 00:40:44.625
the question becomes who bears
the cost of the arrangements.

550
00:40:44.708 --> 00:40:46.083
We'll take care of Leonard.

551
00:40:49.916 --> 00:40:52.750
Okay. I've got the paperwork right here.

552
00:40:58.833 --> 00:40:59.666
What's that?

553
00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:01.041
His favorite tea.

554
00:41:10.208 --> 00:41:11.041
Thanks.

555
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:14.583
For Leonard.

556
00:41:15.958 --> 00:41:16.791
Leonard.

557
00:41:21.333 --> 00:41:22.791
We should put the money back.

558
00:41:24.875 --> 00:41:26.000
It doesn't feel right.

559
00:41:32.208 --> 00:41:33.291
Let's just be here.

560
00:41:34.416 --> 00:41:35.250
For Leonard.

561
00:41:41.541 --> 00:41:43.125
We should say something.

562
00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:45.666
"And he shall be like a tree.

563
00:41:46.125 --> 00:41:48.125
planted by the rivers of water.

564
00:41:48.208 --> 00:41:50.666
That bringeth forth
his fruit in his season

565
00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:53.666
and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper."

566
00:41:55.583 --> 00:41:57.041
I'm sorry. Who are you?

567
00:41:57.625 --> 00:42:00.958
Apologies. Ms. Franklin.
My name is Julia Byron-Kim.

568
00:42:01.541 --> 00:42:03.000
I'm Mr. Wellsley's attorney.

569
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:07.541
Ms. Byron-Kim.

570
00:42:08.541 --> 00:42:11.708
Leonard never said anything
about an attorney.

571
00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:14.708
Please. call me Julia.
And I'm not surprised.

572
00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:16.500
What do you mean?

573
00:42:17.166 --> 00:42:19.916
The first I heard from Mr. Wellsley
was only a few weeks ago.

574
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.791
He called me out of the blue.
wanting me to write up his will.

575
00:42:22.875 --> 00:42:24.666
and asked me to come to the house.

576
00:42:25.541 --> 00:42:28.583
-I never saw you here.
-He was very specific about that.

577
00:42:28.666 --> 00:42:30.375
I was to only come in the evenings.

578
00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:32.083
Why?

579
00:42:38.666 --> 00:42:40.125
He left everything to you.

580
00:42:51.041 --> 00:42:52.916
-Oh. my God!
-Congratulations.

581
00:42:53.458 --> 00:42:54.416
Oh. my God!

582
00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.166
I don't even know what to say. This is...

583
00:42:57.583 --> 00:42:58.875
Say thank you. Leonard!

584
00:43:01.208 --> 00:43:02.083
Wow.

585
00:43:02.416 --> 00:43:05.250
Okay. so what happens now?

586
00:43:05.791 --> 00:43:08.583
First. I suggest you read
over the will very carefully.

587
00:43:08.833 --> 00:43:11.125
Better yet. I would have
your lawyer take a look.

588
00:43:11.208 --> 00:43:12.500
Actually. we don't have a lawyer.

589
00:43:14.541 --> 00:43:17.166
Well. Mr. Wellsley did pay my retainer
in advance.

590
00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:20.083
asked that I help you
through this transition.

591
00:43:20.166 --> 00:43:22.125
What transition?
We can't just move in right away?

592
00:43:22.791 --> 00:43:23.708
Of course you can.

593
00:43:23.791 --> 00:43:26.208
with the understanding
that the will is going through probate.

594
00:43:26.291 --> 00:43:27.875
which takes about three months.

595
00:43:28.791 --> 00:43:30.666
And if there are any surprises.

596
00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:33.083
you should have someone
to look after your interests.

597
00:43:33.708 --> 00:43:36.458
Now. I understand if you
want to find your own lawyer.

598
00:43:36.541 --> 00:43:39.208
You said Leonard called you
out of the blue.

599
00:43:39.291 --> 00:43:40.541
You didn't know him?

600
00:43:41.833 --> 00:43:43.000
I never met him before.

601
00:43:45.083 --> 00:43:46.583
Why did he call you?

602
00:43:46.916 --> 00:43:48.333
He found me on the Internet.

603
00:43:49.125 --> 00:43:50.666
He said that he liked my name.

604
00:43:52.666 --> 00:43:54.166
Byron was his favorite poet.

605
00:43:57.250 --> 00:43:58.083
Ms. Byron-Kim.

606
00:43:58.833 --> 00:44:00.250
Sorry. Julia...

607
00:44:02.208 --> 00:44:03.333
I'm kind of new at this.

608
00:44:03.416 --> 00:44:05.958
I'm not really sure
how to go about it officially.

609
00:44:06.708 --> 00:44:08.166
but I could really use your help.

610
00:44:10.166 --> 00:44:12.250
There are some big changes
coming your way.

611
00:44:12.333 --> 00:44:13.333
I hope you're ready.

612
00:44:13.958 --> 00:44:14.791
Me too.

613
00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:18.125
And how about Adam?

614
00:44:18.791 --> 00:44:19.625
What about him?

615
00:44:19.708 --> 00:44:21.208
Well. he does understand that legally.

616
00:44:21.291 --> 00:44:24.208
where it comes to this house.
you make all the decisions.

617
00:44:25.291 --> 00:44:27.208
We've always decided things together.

618
00:44:27.291 --> 00:44:28.625
Which is how it should be.

619
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.125
These things. you just never know
how it can change someone.

620
00:44:36.208 --> 00:44:37.166
We'll be okay.

621
00:44:37.958 --> 00:44:38.791
Good.

622
00:44:39.208 --> 00:44:40.791
-Leave it to me then.
-Great.

623
00:44:40.875 --> 00:44:42.291
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

624
00:44:42.666 --> 00:44:45.833
We should take a vacation for a month.
Just first class all the way.

625
00:44:45.916 --> 00:44:49.291
You'll get your MBA before you know it.
Find a great job.

626
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.958
-That piece of junk that we drive.
-We can pay off everything.

627
00:44:53.041 --> 00:44:56.750
Credit cards. loans.
just wipe the slate clean.

628
00:44:56.833 --> 00:44:59.958
You know. we should go right now.
Both of us. Just go pick brand new cars.

629
00:45:00.041 --> 00:45:02.250
-Come on. Adam. I'm serious.
-Yeah. me too.

630
00:45:02.375 --> 00:45:05.375
-We can't do that.
-Why not? We have the money.

631
00:45:05.458 --> 00:45:08.750
We can't just walk in there
with all that cash. It'll look weird.

632
00:45:08.833 --> 00:45:11.625
-People are gonna ask questions.
-Yeah. No. You're right.

633
00:45:12.333 --> 00:45:14.625
I did some research online
and been looking into that.

634
00:45:14.708 --> 00:45:15.541
Into what?

635
00:45:15.833 --> 00:45:19.083
See there's ways we can make it work.
right? We just spread the money around.

636
00:45:19.166 --> 00:45:20.916
Different banks.
different kinds of accounts.

637
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.541
What are you talking about?

638
00:45:22.625 --> 00:45:26.041
If we do this right.
it's like nobody will ever know.

639
00:45:26.125 --> 00:45:28.250
We can get away with so much in taxes.

640
00:45:28.458 --> 00:45:29.291
Adam.

641
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.083
We still have to be careful.

642
00:45:32.583 --> 00:45:34.625
We have been careful. okay?

643
00:45:34.708 --> 00:45:37.333
Don't you think it's time for us
to treat ourselves?

644
00:45:37.708 --> 00:45:38.583
You earned it.

645
00:45:39.083 --> 00:45:40.291
God knows I have.

646
00:45:41.041 --> 00:45:45.041
I mean maybe you're right.
but we have to settle in first.

647
00:45:45.125 --> 00:45:47.500
take things slow. you know. Just...

648
00:45:48.208 --> 00:45:50.458
Just a little while longer. Okay?

649
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:54.833
Yeah.

650
00:45:55.125 --> 00:45:55.958
Okay.

651
00:45:57.583 --> 00:45:58.625
We'll take it slow.

652
00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:12.541
I'll call the movers. See how soon
we can get them over here.

653
00:46:12.625 --> 00:46:14.958
What? We don't need any of this stuff.

654
00:46:15.416 --> 00:46:18.125
What? It's our stuff.
We've had it since we got married.

655
00:46:18.208 --> 00:46:21.083
Yeah well. here. we'll keep the pictures
and some of those books.

656
00:46:21.166 --> 00:46:22.791
and we don't need the rest of this junk.

657
00:46:22.875 --> 00:46:24.750
What are we supposed to do with all of it?

658
00:46:24.916 --> 00:46:27.875
Just leave it for the next poor losers
that have to live in this dump. right?

659
00:46:27.958 --> 00:46:29.500
-Jeez. Adam.

660
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:31.583
Hello?

661
00:46:36.166 --> 00:46:39.541
Yeah. that was five months ago and
I already gave the police my statement.

662
00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:41.958
<i>Who was it who called you. sir?</i>

663
00:46:42.291 --> 00:46:45.875
I didn't get the name. He just said
talk to someone at the front desk.

664
00:46:47.458 --> 00:46:48.291
I got nothing.

665
00:46:50.416 --> 00:46:52.541
Mr.<i> </i>Kettner. everything okay?

666
00:46:52.625 --> 00:46:54.958
He says somebody told him
to come down. make a statement.

667
00:46:55.458 --> 00:46:56.333
What's this regarding?

668
00:46:58.125 --> 00:47:01.375
Like five months ago somebody robbed
the Smile Diner. killed somebody.

669
00:47:02.166 --> 00:47:03.833
You were at the diner that night?

670
00:47:03.958 --> 00:47:04.791
Yes.

671
00:47:05.958 --> 00:47:07.291
Lucky you didn't get hurt.

672
00:47:07.708 --> 00:47:08.666
I kinda stopped the guy.

673
00:47:09.166 --> 00:47:10.000
You did?

674
00:47:10.083 --> 00:47:13.416
Yeah. in that situation. I reacted.
My wife was working that night so...

675
00:47:14.625 --> 00:47:15.833
Ms. Franklin was there too?

676
00:47:15.958 --> 00:47:19.791
Yeah. but what I don't understand
is you already have the guy locked up.

677
00:47:19.875 --> 00:47:21.666
Why do they need another statement?

678
00:47:22.708 --> 00:47:23.541
They don't.

679
00:47:24.333 --> 00:47:25.583
What are you talking about?

680
00:47:26.541 --> 00:47:29.416
That guy from the diner. Ray Gaskin.

681
00:47:29.666 --> 00:47:31.125
-Yeah.
-He's dead.

682
00:47:32.083 --> 00:47:34.708
Somebody stabbed him
in his cell a couple weeks ago.

683
00:47:36.125 --> 00:47:37.208
So who called me?

684
00:47:39.166 --> 00:47:40.666
Kind of wondering that myself.

685
00:48:04.166 --> 00:48:05.000
Excuse me?

686
00:48:06.041 --> 00:48:08.041
Hello. Katie. Do you remember me?

687
00:48:08.708 --> 00:48:10.083
Yeah. what are you doing back here?

688
00:48:10.166 --> 00:48:14.000
I know. a pain in the ass. right?
But my client. he's driving me nuts.

689
00:48:14.083 --> 00:48:19.041
He just-- He absolutely loves the place.
I think he wants to make an offer.

690
00:48:19.125 --> 00:48:20.375
I told you already.

691
00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:22.041
It's not for sale.

692
00:48:22.125 --> 00:48:24.791
Maybe. if I could speak
with the owner myself.

693
00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:26.625
at least I can say I tried.

694
00:48:26.708 --> 00:48:30.708
Look. I'm really busy and you can't
just show up here like this. so...

695
00:48:32.416 --> 00:48:34.333
I want you to go now. Please.

696
00:48:36.833 --> 00:48:37.791
You know. Katie?

697
00:48:39.125 --> 00:48:40.708
This ain't my first rodeo.

698
00:48:42.625 --> 00:48:45.041
You know. one of the first lessons
in real estate...

699
00:48:45.708 --> 00:48:47.958
if you want to find new listings.

700
00:48:48.541 --> 00:48:49.625
check the obituaries.

701
00:48:50.125 --> 00:48:51.333
Yes.

702
00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:54.583
I know all about the late Mr. Wellsley.

703
00:48:55.375 --> 00:48:56.208
Sad.

704
00:48:58.541 --> 00:49:00.166
The house isn't for sale.

705
00:49:01.166 --> 00:49:04.083
You know. I've had my eye
on this house for a couple years.

706
00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:06.250
The old man...

707
00:49:07.125 --> 00:49:08.083
kicks the bucket...

708
00:49:09.333 --> 00:49:11.666
and you think you can just move in?

709
00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:13.375
I'm gonna smile?

710
00:49:14.041 --> 00:49:14.875
Wish you well?

711
00:49:18.875 --> 00:49:20.000
I own the house now.

712
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:22.875
What the hell are you saying?

713
00:49:22.958 --> 00:49:24.333
Leonard left it to me.

714
00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:26.875
I have his will. I can prove it.

715
00:49:28.375 --> 00:49:29.541
Yeah. well for five grand

716
00:49:29.625 --> 00:49:33.041
I can make a new will that says
it belongs to my dear Aunt Myrtle.

717
00:49:33.125 --> 00:49:33.958
I have a lawyer.

718
00:49:34.041 --> 00:49:35.000
Of course you do.

719
00:49:35.083 --> 00:49:38.041
If you have any more questions.
I suggest you talk to her

720
00:49:38.125 --> 00:49:42.000
but. in the meantime. get the hell off
my property before I call the police.

721
00:49:44.333 --> 00:49:47.500
All right. Well. I guess
I'll see you around. Katie.

722
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.375
He's just messing with you.

723
00:49:56.708 --> 00:49:58.000
It's not how it sounded.

724
00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:01.583
He practically accused me
of forging the will.

725
00:50:03.291 --> 00:50:04.208
Babe. trust me.

726
00:50:04.291 --> 00:50:06.958
The thing this guy cares about
is what he's losing on commission.

727
00:50:07.583 --> 00:50:08.875
Maybe I should talk to Julia.

728
00:50:12.833 --> 00:50:13.666
The lawyer?

729
00:50:14.583 --> 00:50:15.416
Why?

730
00:50:15.708 --> 00:50:18.625
In case Hayden tries to make trouble?

731
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:20.625
What could he do?

732
00:50:20.708 --> 00:50:24.916
I don't know but it's like she said.
we don't want any surprises right now.

733
00:50:26.208 --> 00:50:27.041
Katie.

734
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:30.833
This guy is just pissed off.
Forget about him.

735
00:50:32.166 --> 00:50:33.041
Come on.

736
00:50:33.708 --> 00:50:35.333
It's our first night in our new house.

737
00:50:36.333 --> 00:50:37.333
We should celebrate.

738
00:50:41.625 --> 00:50:42.458
Yeah?

739
00:50:43.291 --> 00:50:44.125
Mm-hmm.

740
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:46.208
What did you have in mind?

741
00:50:48.916 --> 00:50:50.166
I can think of something.

742
00:50:56.875 --> 00:50:58.833
-Let me take a shower first.
-What?

743
00:50:58.916 --> 00:51:01.333
I've been cleaning the house all day.
I'll be right out.

744
00:51:22.958 --> 00:51:23.833
What is this?

745
00:51:26.791 --> 00:51:29.208
My old one stopped working. so...

746
00:51:29.916 --> 00:51:31.041
Looks expensive.

747
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:34.250
Well. it's a knock off.

748
00:51:34.708 --> 00:51:36.250
Just bought it from some guy downtown.

749
00:51:39.333 --> 00:51:40.166
Very convincing.

750
00:51:44.541 --> 00:51:45.416
You want company?

751
00:51:48.791 --> 00:51:49.708
I'll be right out.

752
00:52:33.083 --> 00:52:34.041
Detective!

753
00:52:34.666 --> 00:52:37.875
-Looks like I came at a bad time.
-No. you're fine. Come in.

754
00:52:38.333 --> 00:52:39.666
You folks going somewhere?

755
00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:44.041
Yeah. we're moving. actually.
into Leonard's house.

756
00:52:44.125 --> 00:52:44.958
Leonard?

757
00:52:45.416 --> 00:52:46.708
As in Mr. Wellsley?

758
00:52:46.791 --> 00:52:49.583
I know. I'm still getting used
to the idea myself.

759
00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:54.583
Leonard left it to me in his will.

760
00:52:56.041 --> 00:52:59.416
Now then. that is a very nice house.

761
00:52:59.791 --> 00:53:00.916
Yes. it is.

762
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.791
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

763
00:53:03.625 --> 00:53:06.291
So. a thing like that.
what do they call it?

764
00:53:07.875 --> 00:53:08.750
A windfall.

765
00:53:10.416 --> 00:53:11.666
Doesn't happen every day.

766
00:53:12.083 --> 00:53:12.916
Nope.

767
00:53:14.916 --> 00:53:16.666
Funny you forgot to mention it.

768
00:53:17.083 --> 00:53:17.916
What?

769
00:53:18.125 --> 00:53:20.666
The will. and all. when we spoke.

770
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:22.708
I asked you about his family.
about a will.

771
00:53:22.791 --> 00:53:26.875
Oh no. I didn't know about it until
after the service. His lawyer came by.

772
00:53:27.208 --> 00:53:28.875
That must've been quite a shock.

773
00:53:29.416 --> 00:53:30.958
Yeah. it was.

774
00:53:32.125 --> 00:53:34.458
I'd have loved to see
the look on your face.

775
00:53:34.625 --> 00:53:36.500
You know. I mean you worked there for...

776
00:53:37.208 --> 00:53:39.083
what did you say? Four months?

777
00:53:41.250 --> 00:53:42.875
Why are you here. Detective?

778
00:53:44.541 --> 00:53:46.333
I was hoping to speak with your husband.

779
00:53:47.166 --> 00:53:48.000
He's not here.

780
00:53:49.625 --> 00:53:52.000
Well. maybe you can help me.

781
00:53:52.250 --> 00:53:54.041
See. I was wondering

782
00:53:54.291 --> 00:53:57.750
when you worked nights at that place.
the Smile Diner.

783
00:53:58.250 --> 00:54:00.000
did he pick you up all the time?

784
00:54:02.083 --> 00:54:04.541
I mean. he picked you up before.

785
00:54:06.125 --> 00:54:06.958
Yeah.

786
00:54:07.208 --> 00:54:08.791
Right. but was it a set thing?

787
00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:11.666
Was it every night. was it certain nights?

788
00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:13.541
No. not exactly.

789
00:54:13.958 --> 00:54:15.833
So how did he happen
to be there that night?

790
00:54:17.041 --> 00:54:22.208
I-- I called him to pick me up
and he came early to study.

791
00:54:24.291 --> 00:54:26.833
Well. you ought to play the lottery.
Katie.

792
00:54:27.625 --> 00:54:29.000
You're a very lucky woman.

793
00:54:31.833 --> 00:54:34.208
Does this have anything
to do with the fact that

794
00:54:34.583 --> 00:54:37.583
the police called Adam
about making another statement?

795
00:54:38.916 --> 00:54:39.875
He didn't tell you?

796
00:54:41.958 --> 00:54:43.416
Police never called Adam.

797
00:54:44.833 --> 00:54:47.625
No. I was here.
They called him down at the station.

798
00:54:47.708 --> 00:54:49.500
No. I checked it out after he left.

799
00:54:49.875 --> 00:54:52.333
There's no record
of any calls to his number.

800
00:54:53.416 --> 00:54:55.875
That doesn't make any sense.
Why would-- Why would anyone...

801
00:54:56.541 --> 00:54:58.375
send him down there for no reason?

802
00:54:58.833 --> 00:55:00.791
Well. maybe they had a reason.

803
00:55:01.958 --> 00:55:03.916
Maybe it's just not the one you think.

804
00:55:05.666 --> 00:55:06.500
Take care now.

805
00:55:25.666 --> 00:55:28.041
Thanks. Julia.
I'll talk to you later. bye.

806
00:55:40.291 --> 00:55:41.125
Katie.

807
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:42.916
What did she want?

808
00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:46.250
I called her. actually.

809
00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:48.458
What did you tell her?

810
00:55:49.375 --> 00:55:50.208
Nothing.

811
00:55:53.166 --> 00:55:54.458
That's not how it looked.

812
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.375
Looked like you guys were best friends
all of a sudden.

813
00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:59.458
Well. maybe if you'd been here.

814
00:56:00.041 --> 00:56:01.666
maybe if you'd answered your phone...

815
00:56:03.291 --> 00:56:04.125
We agreed.

816
00:56:05.625 --> 00:56:07.375
We decided you were not going
to talk to her.

817
00:56:07.458 --> 00:56:09.416
No. you decided.

818
00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:12.791
Like you've been deciding
a lot of things lately.

819
00:56:15.375 --> 00:56:17.000
What are you even talking about?

820
00:56:17.916 --> 00:56:21.833
Why didn't you tell me
that it wasn't the police who called you?

821
00:56:22.458 --> 00:56:25.000
It was somebody else who made
sure you went down there. right?

822
00:56:25.333 --> 00:56:26.166
Who told you that?

823
00:56:27.416 --> 00:56:29.375
Detective Chesler dropped by.

824
00:56:31.208 --> 00:56:33.250
And she was asking a lot of questions.

825
00:56:33.791 --> 00:56:34.666
about you.

826
00:56:35.250 --> 00:56:37.958
about what happened
the night of the diner.

827
00:56:38.833 --> 00:56:39.833
What is that about.

828
00:56:39.916 --> 00:56:40.750
Adam?

829
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:42.791
How should I know?

830
00:56:42.875 --> 00:56:43.791
Who called?

831
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.333
-Who sent you to the police station?
-I don't know!

832
00:56:47.541 --> 00:56:49.458
My bad. I was gonna tell you about it.

833
00:56:49.541 --> 00:56:52.083
It's a whole lot of other stuff
has been happening right now.

834
00:56:52.166 --> 00:56:53.250
What other stuff?

835
00:56:55.583 --> 00:56:56.750
I think I'm being followed.

836
00:56:58.375 --> 00:56:59.208
What?

837
00:56:59.583 --> 00:57:01.208
I kind of had the feeling before.

838
00:57:01.916 --> 00:57:04.875
Today. I just went driving
around. just around.

839
00:57:06.541 --> 00:57:08.000
I kept seeing the same car.

840
00:57:11.875 --> 00:57:13.041
Did you go to the bank?

841
00:57:13.541 --> 00:57:16.416
-Come on. we said we would not do that.
-No. Adam. No bullshit.

842
00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:19.000
Just tell me.
Did you go to the bank today?

843
00:57:19.625 --> 00:57:20.916
Did you take money out?

844
00:57:21.333 --> 00:57:22.375
I noticed him.

845
00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:24.666
So I figured. you know.

846
00:57:25.208 --> 00:57:27.333
it wouldn't be a good idea. Just in case.

847
00:57:27.416 --> 00:57:28.708
In case he was after the money.

848
00:57:28.791 --> 00:57:31.791
-We don't know that.
-Why else is he watching you?

849
00:57:31.875 --> 00:57:33.291
Look. maybe I'm just paranoid.

850
00:57:33.375 --> 00:57:36.041
Okay? Maybe there's nobody
who's following me. I don't know.

851
00:57:36.125 --> 00:57:38.541
You got sent down
to the police station. Adam.

852
00:57:38.625 --> 00:57:40.291
That way. I'm here alone.

853
00:57:40.375 --> 00:57:43.833
That way. Hayden shows up.
tries to intimidate me.

854
00:57:44.041 --> 00:57:47.250
scare us out of the house. What is that?
Why is he here?

855
00:57:47.958 --> 00:57:49.291
Because he probably knows.

856
00:57:52.125 --> 00:57:52.958
I warned you.

857
00:58:04.541 --> 00:58:05.375
Chesler.

858
00:58:06.291 --> 00:58:07.125
Hey. Tom.

859
00:58:08.458 --> 00:58:09.291
You did?

860
00:58:10.375 --> 00:58:11.208
Great.

861
00:58:11.916 --> 00:58:13.791
Great. okay. Hold on.

862
00:58:17.083 --> 00:58:20.250
All right. so probably just
from the last four. five months.

863
00:58:20.541 --> 00:58:24.375
We're looking for any checks drawn
on an account from a Leonard Wellsley.

864
00:58:25.875 --> 00:58:27.583
Yeah. made out to her name.

865
00:58:28.041 --> 00:58:28.875
Yeah.

866
00:58:29.708 --> 00:58:31.666
It's Kate... Franklin.

867
00:58:38.041 --> 00:58:40.375
Listen. can you see
what you got on the husband too?

868
00:58:40.458 --> 00:58:42.000
It's a different last name.

869
00:58:43.125 --> 00:58:45.125
It's an Adam Kettner with a "K."

870
00:58:46.583 --> 00:58:49.083
Great. get back to me
as soon as you can. Thanks.

871
00:59:11.041 --> 00:59:12.166
What are you looking for?

872
00:59:15.375 --> 00:59:17.541
Leonard didn't just stash that money.

873
00:59:18.333 --> 00:59:21.208
It had to come from somewhere.
There has to be a reason.

874
00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:23.583
Does that even matter now?

875
00:59:30.041 --> 00:59:31.083
Julia said...

876
00:59:32.041 --> 00:59:35.208
if they find out
we've been hiding something illegal.

877
00:59:35.541 --> 00:59:36.875
we could lose everything.

878
00:59:38.208 --> 00:59:39.041
All right.

879
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:42.000
So what do you suggest?
We just give it all back?

880
00:59:42.083 --> 00:59:42.916
I don't know.

881
00:59:44.291 --> 00:59:45.500
Yeah. maybe.

882
00:59:46.916 --> 00:59:49.000
-To whom. Katie?
-I don't know!

883
00:59:50.833 --> 00:59:52.250
But this never felt right.

884
00:59:54.916 --> 00:59:57.375
I'm not going back to the way
things were before.

885
00:59:59.333 --> 01:00:00.166
Adam.

886
01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:03.750
We may not have a choice.

887
01:00:07.541 --> 01:00:08.791
We always have a choice.

888
01:00:12.666 --> 01:00:17.250
I had absolutely no idea
that Mr. Wellsley left Katie the house.

889
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.625
That seems a little...

890
01:00:20.666 --> 01:00:21.500
excessive.

891
01:00:21.708 --> 01:00:22.625
Doesn't it. though?

892
01:00:23.333 --> 01:00:24.166
Yeah.

893
01:00:26.625 --> 01:00:28.583
What can you tell me about her husband?

894
01:00:29.416 --> 01:00:30.708
I've never met the man.

895
01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:33.583
So you had nothing to do with hiring him?

896
01:00:34.791 --> 01:00:36.625
As a gardener at the house.

897
01:00:38.166 --> 01:00:42.000
No. It's strictly against our policy
for family members to work together.

898
01:00:42.083 --> 01:00:44.916
Our patients are elderly. infirm.

899
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.208
We can't risk that kind
of potential distraction.

900
01:00:48.458 --> 01:00:53.000
So. do you know of Ms. Franklin
ever breaking the rules before?

901
01:00:53.083 --> 01:00:54.208
Never. no.

902
01:00:54.666 --> 01:00:58.083
No. she absolutely understood
the importance of her job. especially...

903
01:00:58.708 --> 01:00:59.583
with Mr. Wellsley.

904
01:00:59.958 --> 01:01:00.958
Why especially him?

905
01:01:01.416 --> 01:01:06.500
Well. you wouldn't have known it to look
at him. but his health was very delicate.

906
01:01:07.041 --> 01:01:09.125
You know. Katie told me.
she kept a notebook.

907
01:01:09.208 --> 01:01:12.000
like. a daily log.
just to keep track of his medication.

908
01:01:12.375 --> 01:01:15.416
Do you happen to have
a record of his medications?

909
01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:19.333
You'd have to speak
with his doctor about that.

910
01:01:19.416 --> 01:01:22.875
Right. How about Ms. Franklin's contract.
how much she was being paid?

911
01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:27.625
Yeah. sure. we can get that to you.

912
01:01:27.708 --> 01:01:30.583
-Yeah.
-Excellent. Thank you. And let me...

913
01:01:33.875 --> 01:01:36.250
just ask you. Did she...

914
01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:40.375
Did she ever mention a raise?

915
01:01:41.666 --> 01:01:42.541
Good lord.

916
01:01:43.125 --> 01:01:45.833
She deposited that check
just before Wellsley died.

917
01:01:48.458 --> 01:01:51.541
Was she really taking money
from that poor old man all along?

918
01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:53.375
It's a good question.

919
01:02:01.583 --> 01:02:02.416
Adam?

920
01:02:15.250 --> 01:02:16.083
Adam!

921
01:03:20.333 --> 01:03:21.166
Shit!

922
01:03:41.958 --> 01:03:42.791
Ethan?

923
01:03:43.916 --> 01:03:45.500
These were never cashed.

924
01:04:32.291 --> 01:04:33.125
You okay?

925
01:04:36.875 --> 01:04:38.375
I think I know who that is.

926
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:39.833
What?

927
01:04:40.875 --> 01:04:43.916
Leonard said something
about hiring a gardener.

928
01:04:44.666 --> 01:04:46.250
I think I told you about this.

929
01:04:46.625 --> 01:04:48.041
A guy named Ethan.

930
01:04:48.333 --> 01:04:49.791
This was a couple years ago.

931
01:04:51.916 --> 01:04:53.625
So he's been up there for a while.

932
01:04:54.208 --> 01:04:56.791
There were checks made out to Ethan Doyle.

933
01:04:57.416 --> 01:04:58.750
They were never cashed.

934
01:04:59.375 --> 01:05:01.916
Leonard said. one day.
he just stopped showing up.

935
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.500
Never heard from him again.

936
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.041
Somebody shot him.

937
01:05:10.416 --> 01:05:11.250
You looked?

938
01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:17.333
He must have bled to death up there.

939
01:05:19.083 --> 01:05:20.041
He was murdered.

940
01:05:21.125 --> 01:05:22.708
Yeah. I think so.

941
01:05:25.791 --> 01:05:26.625
But...

942
01:05:27.291 --> 01:05:29.375
Leonard couldn't have known he was there.

943
01:05:29.916 --> 01:05:31.916
Right? I mean. he would have helped him.

944
01:05:32.458 --> 01:05:36.250
And why would Doyle hide out in the shed?
Why not... come into the house?

945
01:05:43.166 --> 01:05:45.166
Maybe these have something to do with it.

946
01:05:50.916 --> 01:05:51.750
Take a guess.

947
01:05:53.250 --> 01:05:54.083
Wow.

948
01:05:58.333 --> 01:06:00.750
-Do you think they're real?
-Why else would he hide them?

949
01:06:02.666 --> 01:06:03.500
Shit!

950
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.375
Here! Just--

951
01:06:06.708 --> 01:06:08.416
-Oh. God!
-Oh. my God.

952
01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:09.625
Give them here. Come on.

953
01:06:09.708 --> 01:06:10.750
-I'm sorry.
-Dammit.

954
01:06:10.833 --> 01:06:12.541
-Don't answer.
- I saw your car.

955
01:06:12.625 --> 01:06:15.166
But I can't. My car is parked outside.
They know I'm here.

956
01:06:16.125 --> 01:06:17.708
-Okay. I'm just gonna...
-I got it.

957
01:06:17.791 --> 01:06:19.916
Open the door!
Do you hear me? Katie!

958
01:06:21.208 --> 01:06:23.166
Katie. open the door please!

959
01:06:24.375 --> 01:06:26.000
I'm sorry. This really isn't a good time.

960
01:06:26.083 --> 01:06:29.125
Well. yeah. I'm sure you're very busy
settling into your new home.

961
01:06:29.208 --> 01:06:30.625
You should be ashamed of yourself.

962
01:06:30.708 --> 01:06:32.958
How could you take advantage
of that poor man?

963
01:06:33.041 --> 01:06:34.666
-What?
-Look. I knew something was up.

964
01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:35.708
I could feel it.

965
01:06:35.791 --> 01:06:38.625
But you know what? You had him
so frightened he couldn't even tell me.

966
01:06:38.708 --> 01:06:40.000
It's not-- No!

967
01:06:40.083 --> 01:06:42.041
I'm not letting you
tarnish my company's good name.

968
01:06:42.125 --> 01:06:43.416
-Mr. Calvern--
-I'll find proof!

969
01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:44.833
I'm gonna call the police!

970
01:06:44.916 --> 01:06:47.375
-I'm gonna have you arrested!
-This really isn't a good time.

971
01:06:49.166 --> 01:06:50.666
This isn't over. Katie!

972
01:06:50.916 --> 01:06:51.833
I'll be back!

973
01:06:53.625 --> 01:06:57.291
I'm gonna find out what's been going on
in this house. one way or another!

974
01:06:57.666 --> 01:07:02.083
I'm not letting this go! You hear me?
I'm not gonna lose my business over this!

975
01:07:41.083 --> 01:07:42.500
Why isn't this full?

976
01:07:59.375 --> 01:08:00.208
Katie?

977
01:08:02.916 --> 01:08:03.750
Hey. Katie!

978
01:08:06.958 --> 01:08:07.875
Hey.

979
01:08:08.541 --> 01:08:10.875
-Didn't you hear me?
-Hi. sorry. I was making tea.

980
01:08:11.208 --> 01:08:12.041
You want some?

981
01:08:12.833 --> 01:08:14.250
No. I got you a present.

982
01:08:16.125 --> 01:08:16.958
A new phone?

983
01:08:17.833 --> 01:08:19.666
Yeah. Got one for each of us.

984
01:08:20.416 --> 01:08:22.750
New numbers too. I figured
the way things were going.

985
01:08:22.833 --> 01:08:24.333
we could both use a little privacy.

986
01:08:31.541 --> 01:08:33.083
We can't keep them.

987
01:08:35.833 --> 01:08:37.041
-Katie--
-Adam. no.

988
01:08:37.833 --> 01:08:41.666
There is a dead man out there.
He was murdered.

989
01:08:42.333 --> 01:08:43.541
He stole those diamonds.

990
01:08:43.625 --> 01:08:46.833
And who knows what else
he may have done. who he may have hurt.

991
01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:50.500
These things don't just go away
like they never happened.

992
01:08:50.583 --> 01:08:53.500
-The police must be looking for him.
-Don't you get this?

993
01:08:53.875 --> 01:08:55.166
Doyle stole the diamonds.

994
01:08:55.583 --> 01:08:58.583
got himself shot.
and then he died out there all by himself.

995
01:08:58.708 --> 01:09:00.833
It's like-- It's like he fell down a well.

996
01:09:02.916 --> 01:09:03.833
Two years later.

997
01:09:03.916 --> 01:09:07.875
nobody knows what happened to him or
the diamonds. We can do whatever we want.

998
01:09:11.083 --> 01:09:13.666
-What are you doing?
-I'm calling Detective Chesler.

999
01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:15.541
-We need to tell her--
-No! Wait!

1000
01:09:15.625 --> 01:09:19.666
Wait. just-- Okay. hang on.
Just listen to me for just a second.

1001
01:09:20.333 --> 01:09:24.125
Okay. ask yourself. What the heck
was Doyle doing here in the first place?

1002
01:09:24.208 --> 01:09:26.291
Why take some crappy gardening job

1003
01:09:26.375 --> 01:09:28.833
if he's planning to steal a fortune
in diamonds?

1004
01:09:29.416 --> 01:09:30.250
I don't know.

1005
01:09:31.125 --> 01:09:33.250
Some old guy's house digging up weeds

1006
01:09:33.333 --> 01:09:36.083
is the last place
that anybody's gonna come looking for him.

1007
01:09:36.375 --> 01:09:38.750
I mean. think about it.
Why else wouldn't he cash the checks?

1008
01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:42.083
He didn't want to leave a paper trail.

1009
01:09:42.916 --> 01:09:44.708
That way he sets up the big score.

1010
01:09:45.041 --> 01:09:48.125
Nobody knows about this place
and he can just hide here

1011
01:09:48.458 --> 01:09:49.875
for as long as he needs to.

1012
01:09:50.791 --> 01:09:53.625
Although. I'm sure
that getting shot and dying out there

1013
01:09:53.708 --> 01:09:56.458
-was probably not a part of the plan.
-That doesn't change anything.

1014
01:09:56.541 --> 01:09:58.333
We can't keep those diamonds.

1015
01:09:58.416 --> 01:10:00.208
All right. so what about the money?

1016
01:10:01.208 --> 01:10:02.541
What are we gonna do about that?

1017
01:10:02.625 --> 01:10:03.500
What do you mean?

1018
01:10:03.583 --> 01:10:06.750
If we do this.
then the police put us under a microscope.

1019
01:10:06.833 --> 01:10:08.208
so how is that going to look?

1020
01:10:08.291 --> 01:10:10.625
We took the money from here
and then we hid it in the bank.

1021
01:10:10.708 --> 01:10:11.708
What are they gonna think?

1022
01:10:11.791 --> 01:10:13.291
We'll explain it to them.

1023
01:10:14.125 --> 01:10:17.000
Tell them it was Leonard's money.
that it was his safety net.

1024
01:10:17.083 --> 01:10:18.166
All right. and then what?

1025
01:10:18.291 --> 01:10:20.875
'Cause you heard what the lawyer said.
Even if they believe us.

1026
01:10:20.958 --> 01:10:24.541
even if we don't end up in jail.
we could still lose this place.

1027
01:10:24.625 --> 01:10:26.500
We don't need this house. Adam!

1028
01:10:27.041 --> 01:10:28.541
We don't need any of this.

1029
01:10:28.916 --> 01:10:31.666
Okay? As long as we have each other.

1030
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.083
we're going to be all right.

1031
01:10:33.208 --> 01:10:34.041
All right?

1032
01:10:34.916 --> 01:10:36.125
I'm done with all right.

1033
01:10:37.416 --> 01:10:38.708
That's not enough anymore.

1034
01:10:38.791 --> 01:10:41.208
I told you. I'm not going back
to the way things were before.

1035
01:10:41.291 --> 01:10:44.416
And what about that man out there?
What are we supposed to do about that?

1036
01:10:45.041 --> 01:10:46.791
Pretend it never happened?

1037
01:10:46.875 --> 01:10:47.958
I'll take care of it.

1038
01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:50.666
How? How are you gonna do that?

1039
01:10:52.916 --> 01:10:53.750
This house

1040
01:10:54.166 --> 01:10:55.208
belongs to us now.

1041
01:10:55.791 --> 01:10:57.041
Okay. this is our future.

1042
01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.291
I'm not gonna let anybody
take that away from us.

1043
01:11:06.458 --> 01:11:08.166
Look. everything is gonna be okay.

1044
01:11:13.666 --> 01:11:15.250
I'll take care of this for you.

1045
01:12:48.833 --> 01:12:50.083
What are you doing?

1046
01:12:51.166 --> 01:12:52.583
Someone's in the house.

1047
01:12:54.208 --> 01:12:55.875
Where did you get that?

1048
01:13:08.208 --> 01:13:09.041
Adam.

1049
01:13:09.333 --> 01:13:11.666
- Don't.
- Don't move.

1050
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:13.416
We need to call 911.

1051
01:13:27.875 --> 01:13:28.708
Freeze. asshole!

1052
01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:38.083
Oh. my God.

1053
01:13:39.333 --> 01:13:40.291
Calvern.

1054
01:13:57.083 --> 01:13:58.208
Where's the girl?

1055
01:14:03.541 --> 01:14:05.166
How are you holding up. Katie?

1056
01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:08.041
Detective Chesler.

1057
01:14:09.708 --> 01:14:10.541
Hell of a thing.

1058
01:14:14.208 --> 01:14:15.208
It was an accident.

1059
01:14:15.666 --> 01:14:17.375
Yeah. that's what they're saying.

1060
01:14:19.333 --> 01:14:21.875
Either way.
law says it's self-defense. so...

1061
01:14:23.458 --> 01:14:25.208
It still makes you wonder.

1062
01:14:25.833 --> 01:14:27.833
What was going through his head?

1063
01:14:28.541 --> 01:14:30.375
Why would he do something like that?

1064
01:14:31.083 --> 01:14:33.333
Just let himself into the house?

1065
01:14:33.708 --> 01:14:34.625
I don't know.

1066
01:14:41.041 --> 01:14:42.916
Something had to set him off.

1067
01:14:46.916 --> 01:14:48.458
I know none of this is you. Katie.

1068
01:14:50.333 --> 01:14:51.166
What?

1069
01:14:51.250 --> 01:14:54.208
Everything was fine around here
until Adam started work.

1070
01:14:55.125 --> 01:14:57.750
So you can tell me whatever is going on.

1071
01:14:58.166 --> 01:14:59.666
I know that none of it is you.

1072
01:15:00.083 --> 01:15:02.083
I don't know what you're talking about.

1073
01:15:02.333 --> 01:15:04.041
I know about your money problems.

1074
01:15:04.958 --> 01:15:06.291
I know what that does to people.

1075
01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.166
I know about the big check
that you deposited from Mr. Wellsley.

1076
01:15:10.250 --> 01:15:11.583
You don't understand.

1077
01:15:11.666 --> 01:15:13.583
Okay. don't say anything. Katie. Just--

1078
01:15:13.666 --> 01:15:14.916
Just listen for a second.

1079
01:15:15.708 --> 01:15:16.541
Because...

1080
01:15:17.375 --> 01:15:18.541
could be that...

1081
01:15:19.958 --> 01:15:20.833
it was a loan.

1082
01:15:21.041 --> 01:15:22.750
maybe it was a gift. who's to say?

1083
01:15:22.958 --> 01:15:25.125
But I want you
to put yourself in my shoes.

1084
01:15:25.208 --> 01:15:26.291
The big picture.

1085
01:15:26.916 --> 01:15:29.916
How all of a sudden.
everything just drops in your lap.

1086
01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.791
-I told you--
-I mean. here I am.

1087
01:15:32.708 --> 01:15:35.583
the coroner tells me
that the old guy died in his sleep.

1088
01:15:35.875 --> 01:15:39.791
You tell me what his last wish was.
And I figure. sure. why not?

1089
01:15:40.250 --> 01:15:43.166
But it is not until after he's cremated

1090
01:15:44.291 --> 01:15:45.291
that you find a will.

1091
01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:48.125
I didn't find it.
I didn't even know about it.

1092
01:15:48.208 --> 01:15:50.125
And I don't even have a body.

1093
01:15:51.250 --> 01:15:54.250
I can't even prove
that he didn't die a natural death.

1094
01:15:57.916 --> 01:16:00.500
I mean I gotta tell you.
it's starting to keep me up at night.

1095
01:16:00.791 --> 01:16:02.666
I would never hurt Leonard.

1096
01:16:02.750 --> 01:16:04.208
I am not talking about you.

1097
01:16:04.791 --> 01:16:05.625
What?

1098
01:16:06.333 --> 01:16:11.583
Has Adam ever mentioned anyone
by the name of Gaskin. a Ray Gaskin?

1099
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.583
I know that name.

1100
01:16:16.666 --> 01:16:18.333
'Cause he tried to rob
the diner that night.

1101
01:16:18.666 --> 01:16:21.333
and he also worked as a janitor
at the university

1102
01:16:21.416 --> 01:16:23.166
while Adam was taking classes.

1103
01:16:23.666 --> 01:16:25.500
-No. that's not... No.
-Okay.

1104
01:16:26.083 --> 01:16:28.541
It's a big school. Maybe they never met.

1105
01:16:30.083 --> 01:16:31.208
But sooner or later...

1106
01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:33.916
Adam is going to screw up.

1107
01:16:34.375 --> 01:16:35.833
It's only a matter of time.

1108
01:16:36.291 --> 01:16:38.541
Don't let him take you down with him.

1109
01:16:38.833 --> 01:16:40.000
You come to me.

1110
01:16:46.208 --> 01:16:47.041
Baby.

1111
01:16:49.541 --> 01:16:50.541
They wanna talk to you.

1112
01:17:10.333 --> 01:17:11.375
Hell of a thing.

1113
01:17:28.583 --> 01:17:29.625
-Katie!
-Hey.

1114
01:17:30.041 --> 01:17:32.916
I heard what happened. Are you all right?
I've been trying to call you.

1115
01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.041
My number's been changed.

1116
01:17:35.041 --> 01:17:36.208
I need to talk to you.

1117
01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:39.333
-Yeah. Come upstairs.
-Okay.

1118
01:17:40.958 --> 01:17:43.583
And this Detective Chesler.
do you believe her?

1119
01:17:43.791 --> 01:17:45.666
Is it possible that
Adam had anything to do

1120
01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:47.375
with what happened
at the diner that night?

1121
01:17:47.458 --> 01:17:48.833
I don't know what to believe.

1122
01:17:51.291 --> 01:17:54.583
Did Adam have any problems
with Mr. Wellsley?

1123
01:17:55.125 --> 01:17:56.166
-Any issues?
-No.

1124
01:17:57.458 --> 01:17:59.000
No. nothing.

1125
01:18:00.291 --> 01:18:03.625
If the police suspect that Adam
had anything to do with his death.

1126
01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:06.208
they'll try to find a motive.

1127
01:18:06.291 --> 01:18:09.250
They're gonna try to claim
that he hurried things along.

1128
01:18:11.833 --> 01:18:13.333
He hated being poor.

1129
01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:14.833
Okay. listen to me.

1130
01:18:14.916 --> 01:18:18.041
If Chesler thinks she can make a case.
she's not gonna waste any time.

1131
01:18:18.125 --> 01:18:20.750
She's gonna try to get a warrant
and search the house right away.

1132
01:18:20.833 --> 01:18:21.791
Can she do that?

1133
01:18:21.875 --> 01:18:25.000
You need to be asking yourself.
will she find anything?

1134
01:18:30.041 --> 01:18:31.375
You need to promise me.

1135
01:18:33.291 --> 01:18:34.166
Promise me

1136
01:18:34.833 --> 01:18:36.375
that you'll help Adam too.

1137
01:18:44.916 --> 01:18:45.750
It's gone.

1138
01:18:46.166 --> 01:18:47.000
What?

1139
01:18:49.583 --> 01:18:50.458
The money.

1140
01:18:51.583 --> 01:18:52.791
Adam must have taken it.

1141
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:55.708
That's what you found? Cash?

1142
01:18:58.458 --> 01:18:59.916
Yeah...

1143
01:19:01.583 --> 01:19:03.000
Almost $100.000...

1144
01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:04.583
in the attic.

1145
01:19:05.708 --> 01:19:07.750
We thought it was stolen at first but...

1146
01:19:07.875 --> 01:19:09.333
And then what changed your mind?

1147
01:19:12.125 --> 01:19:13.125
The diamonds.

1148
01:19:14.625 --> 01:19:16.791
So you found diamonds in the house?

1149
01:19:17.625 --> 01:19:19.625
In the living space above the garage.

1150
01:19:24.333 --> 01:19:26.583
Does Adam have these diamonds?

1151
01:19:28.125 --> 01:19:28.958
Yeah.

1152
01:19:30.416 --> 01:19:31.500
You need to stop him.

1153
01:19:33.041 --> 01:19:33.875
What? Why?

1154
01:19:34.250 --> 01:19:36.625
He knows you suspect something.
That's why he took the money.

1155
01:19:36.708 --> 01:19:38.291
He disappears and throws you to the cops.

1156
01:19:38.375 --> 01:19:40.375
No. Adam would never do that.

1157
01:19:40.458 --> 01:19:41.291
Are you sure?

1158
01:19:43.416 --> 01:19:46.666
You need to find him. bring him
to the house and then call me.

1159
01:19:47.583 --> 01:19:50.375
-You're not coming with me?
-I need to hold off Detective Chesler.

1160
01:19:50.458 --> 01:19:52.125
I don't want her serving
the search warrant

1161
01:19:52.208 --> 01:19:53.500
till we know Adam's in the house.

1162
01:20:17.083 --> 01:20:19.000
-Detective Chesler.
-Detective Johnson.

1163
01:20:19.333 --> 01:20:20.208
What have we got?

1164
01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:23.750
Garbage truck was making its rounds
this morning. called it in.

1165
01:20:23.833 --> 01:20:26.500
-How long's he been in there?
-ME's still en route.

1166
01:20:27.125 --> 01:20:28.041
You beat him here.

1167
01:20:29.583 --> 01:20:30.416
Damn.

1168
01:20:31.541 --> 01:20:32.541
Why did you call me?

1169
01:20:33.708 --> 01:20:35.583
There was a backpack next to the vic.

1170
01:20:35.958 --> 01:20:38.000
Inside we found an old laundry receipt.

1171
01:20:38.833 --> 01:20:40.250
It's pretty faded. but...

1172
01:20:40.666 --> 01:20:43.250
the address matches the name
from one of your cases.

1173
01:20:43.541 --> 01:20:44.375
What's the name?

1174
01:20:44.875 --> 01:20:45.750
Leonard Wellsley.

1175
01:21:04.416 --> 01:21:06.625
Come on. Adam. pick up.

1176
01:21:18.041 --> 01:21:19.708
-Where've you been?
-Adam!

1177
01:21:19.916 --> 01:21:21.875
I'm up half the night talking to the cops.

1178
01:21:21.958 --> 01:21:24.000
I wake up in the morning.
you're already gone.

1179
01:21:24.083 --> 01:21:26.666
There's no note.
You haven't answered your phone all day.

1180
01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:29.166
-Where've you been. Katie?
-The bank.

1181
01:21:29.416 --> 01:21:31.500
That's one of the things
I need to talk to you about.

1182
01:21:32.125 --> 01:21:34.791
-Why did you take the money?
-Cause we're in a lot of trouble.

1183
01:21:34.875 --> 01:21:37.083
Checked up on that real estate agent.
Hayden.

1184
01:21:37.208 --> 01:21:38.666
I mean. what's this guy's deal?

1185
01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:41.000
Why's he so interested
in selling this particular house?

1186
01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:42.500
Guess what?

1187
01:21:42.583 --> 01:21:45.166
There's no record of a Mickey Hayden
getting a real estate license.

1188
01:21:45.250 --> 01:21:47.416
-What?
-Yeah. He just got released from prison.

1189
01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:49.416
Did a couple years
for robbing a jewelry store.

1190
01:21:50.166 --> 01:21:51.000
Jewelry?

1191
01:21:51.083 --> 01:21:53.375
One of those spots downtown.
Doesn't even use a gun.

1192
01:21:53.458 --> 01:21:56.041
He just sweet talks his way
through the security door.

1193
01:21:56.125 --> 01:21:57.958
then he blindsides the armed guard.

1194
01:21:58.041 --> 01:22:00.625
does some old school.
like. smash-and-grab.

1195
01:22:00.708 --> 01:22:03.708
Sixty seconds.
comes out with three million dollars

1196
01:22:03.791 --> 01:22:05.625
in loose diamonds
that were never recovered.

1197
01:22:06.375 --> 01:22:08.958
-That's why he was here.
-Hang on. it gets better.

1198
01:22:09.041 --> 01:22:11.708
Cops think that he had an accomplice
that they never found.

1199
01:22:11.791 --> 01:22:13.125
You wanna take a wild guess?

1200
01:22:14.583 --> 01:22:17.291
This other guy gets shot during
the burglary. then he gets away.

1201
01:22:17.791 --> 01:22:19.458
Doyle got away with the diamonds.

1202
01:22:20.958 --> 01:22:21.791
And...

1203
01:22:22.625 --> 01:22:25.083
there's only one other person
who could've known about it.

1204
01:22:26.166 --> 01:22:27.250
The one who shot him.

1205
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:30.833
Hayden.

1206
01:22:30.916 --> 01:22:33.416
This bastard didn't bother
to use a fake name. What did he think?

1207
01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:35.083
We weren't smart enough to figure it out?

1208
01:22:35.166 --> 01:22:36.416
We have to call the police.

1209
01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:39.916
No. the only thing that we need to do
is get the hell out of Dodge.

1210
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.958
We got plenty of travel money. so...

1211
01:22:42.041 --> 01:22:43.875
сan you go pack some stuff up real fast?

1212
01:22:43.958 --> 01:22:45.291
I'm gonna go get cleaned up.

1213
01:22:47.125 --> 01:22:48.625
You were never gonna leave me.

1214
01:22:50.791 --> 01:22:52.666
What? No. why would I ever leave you?

1215
01:22:56.625 --> 01:22:57.541
Get changed.

1216
01:23:18.333 --> 01:23:19.375
Hi. Julia.

1217
01:23:19.833 --> 01:23:20.666
It's Katie.

1218
01:23:22.250 --> 01:23:23.750
Yeah. he's here. but...

1219
01:23:24.166 --> 01:23:25.583
listen. it wasn't him.

1220
01:23:30.041 --> 01:23:31.041
Where are they?

1221
01:23:32.791 --> 01:23:33.625
I don't know.

1222
01:23:34.208 --> 01:23:35.333
Call him out here.

1223
01:23:40.250 --> 01:23:41.083
Adam?

1224
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:43.833
Adam?

1225
01:23:48.916 --> 01:23:49.750
Adam!

1226
01:23:52.375 --> 01:23:53.583
Right here. baby.

1227
01:23:54.750 --> 01:23:55.583
Let her go.

1228
01:23:55.666 --> 01:23:57.250
Look. I just want the diamonds.

1229
01:23:57.333 --> 01:23:58.250
I said let her go.

1230
01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:01.458
I've been waiting a long time for this.

1231
01:24:01.958 --> 01:24:03.833
So how about
you just tell me where they are?

1232
01:24:03.916 --> 01:24:05.541
Some place you're never gonna find them.

1233
01:24:07.291 --> 01:24:08.708
Are you gonna shoot me. kid?

1234
01:24:09.416 --> 01:24:10.250
That's right.

1235
01:24:10.666 --> 01:24:13.166
'Cause if I just give you the diamonds.
you'll shoot both of us.

1236
01:24:13.250 --> 01:24:14.541
Here's the thing though.

1237
01:24:15.041 --> 01:24:16.708
Even if you hit me from there...

1238
01:24:17.791 --> 01:24:21.416
my gun's gonna go off. and it's gonna
blow a hole in her the size of your head.

1239
01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:23.875
And we don't want that now. do we?

1240
01:24:24.583 --> 01:24:26.708
So. let's just talk about this.

1241
01:24:30.708 --> 01:24:31.833
Adam!

1242
01:24:55.208 --> 01:24:56.875
Son of a bitch.

1243
01:25:08.375 --> 01:25:09.375
Adam!

1244
01:25:10.333 --> 01:25:11.166
No!

1245
01:25:11.375 --> 01:25:12.208
Adam!

1246
01:25:13.166 --> 01:25:14.208
Baby...

1247
01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:15.333
Adam!

1248
01:25:15.958 --> 01:25:16.958
Baby!

1249
01:25:17.166 --> 01:25:18.000
Please.

1250
01:25:18.083 --> 01:25:18.916
Adam.

1251
01:25:21.791 --> 01:25:22.875
...in the garden.

1252
01:25:22.958 --> 01:25:24.250
Stay with me. baby.

1253
01:25:44.375 --> 01:25:45.208
Katie.

1254
01:25:49.666 --> 01:25:50.666
Oh. my God.

1255
01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:55.958
Here. Katie.

1256
01:26:00.291 --> 01:26:01.166
I'm sorry.

1257
01:26:02.541 --> 01:26:03.375
Here. sit.

1258
01:26:07.166 --> 01:26:08.000
Hey.

1259
01:26:10.083 --> 01:26:11.125
Katie. listen.

1260
01:26:12.458 --> 01:26:15.458
We need to look for the diamonds
before the police get here.

1261
01:26:15.541 --> 01:26:16.541
Do you understand?

1262
01:26:17.416 --> 01:26:20.333
It's the only way we can explain
what happened without implicating you.

1263
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.041
-Adam never would have hurt Leonard.
-Katie. the diamonds.

1264
01:26:27.125 --> 01:26:29.333
How could I have ever thought that?

1265
01:26:30.541 --> 01:26:31.541
It was Hayden.

1266
01:26:33.416 --> 01:26:34.250
Hayden...

1267
01:26:34.625 --> 01:26:36.958
killed him with an overdose.

1268
01:26:38.166 --> 01:26:41.333
He read the logbook. the one
I kept for Leonard's medication.

1269
01:26:43.041 --> 01:26:44.500
I found the empty pill bottle.

1270
01:26:44.833 --> 01:26:46.166
How do you know it was Hayden?

1271
01:26:46.791 --> 01:26:49.916
Leonard used to tell me all the time
that he could hear someone in the house.

1272
01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.666
but I never-- I...

1273
01:26:52.583 --> 01:26:53.541
It was Hayden.

1274
01:26:54.458 --> 01:26:55.875
Looking for the diamonds.

1275
01:26:56.583 --> 01:26:58.416
-He couldn't find them.
-But you did?

1276
01:26:59.375 --> 01:27:00.500
I don't understand.

1277
01:27:03.291 --> 01:27:05.500
Why did Hayden shoot Doyle?

1278
01:27:06.416 --> 01:27:09.750
Why didn't--
Why didn't he end up with the diamonds?

1279
01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.583
Because he wasn't half as smart
as he wanted you to think.

1280
01:27:17.250 --> 01:27:21.041
I mean how smart do you have to be
to decide to rip off your partner.

1281
01:27:21.125 --> 01:27:23.333
shoot him while the cops are rolling up.

1282
01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:26.625
and he still gets away
with three million dollars in diamonds?

1283
01:27:27.375 --> 01:27:30.208
Meanwhile. you get busted
and spend two years in prison.

1284
01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:44.208
I never told you how much
the diamonds are worth.

1285
01:27:51.541 --> 01:27:52.458
Oops.

1286
01:27:55.416 --> 01:27:58.375
-What are you doing?
-Look. okay. I paid my dues.

1287
01:27:58.875 --> 01:28:00.958
Okay. I spent ten years
as a public defender.

1288
01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:03.041
How do you think I got Hayden's case?

1289
01:28:03.708 --> 01:28:04.875
I knew he was an idiot.

1290
01:28:05.250 --> 01:28:06.416
But I believed his story.

1291
01:28:07.125 --> 01:28:10.500
And we had an agreement. an understanding.
and. of course. he messes everything up.

1292
01:28:10.791 --> 01:28:12.958
I plea bargained his charges
down to two years.

1293
01:28:13.041 --> 01:28:15.166
I traced Doyle back to
when he worked for Leonard.

1294
01:28:15.250 --> 01:28:17.500
But the only thing
that I couldn't figure out

1295
01:28:17.791 --> 01:28:19.041
was where he was.

1296
01:28:21.416 --> 01:28:22.833
Turns out Doyle was dead.

1297
01:28:24.541 --> 01:28:27.083
You helped kill Leonard?

1298
01:28:27.166 --> 01:28:31.583
No. I had nothing to do with that. okay?
That was all Hayden. He got impatient.

1299
01:28:31.666 --> 01:28:35.125
He wanted to hurry things along.
but I did have to do some fast maneuvering

1300
01:28:35.208 --> 01:28:36.375
to cover up for him.

1301
01:28:38.833 --> 01:28:39.666
The will.

1302
01:28:42.250 --> 01:28:43.500
It isn't real. is it?

1303
01:28:43.583 --> 01:28:44.541
It's real enough.

1304
01:28:45.125 --> 01:28:47.583
With no one to contest it.
what's the difference?

1305
01:28:48.166 --> 01:28:50.875
Look. I'm sure Leonard would've given you
the house if he was alive.

1306
01:28:50.958 --> 01:28:52.625
but that is beside the point.

1307
01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:57.125
Right now. I need you to tell me
where the diamonds are.

1308
01:28:59.458 --> 01:29:00.333
I don't know.

1309
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:04.875
Katie.

1310
01:29:05.583 --> 01:29:06.583
Adam hid them.

1311
01:29:07.333 --> 01:29:09.083
I really don't know where they are.

1312
01:29:09.916 --> 01:29:11.666
But I wouldn't tell you if I did.

1313
01:29:15.833 --> 01:29:17.625
You know.
that's what I really liked about you.

1314
01:29:17.708 --> 01:29:19.458
-It was never about the money.

1315
01:29:22.666 --> 01:29:24.125
But I'm sure they'll turn up.

1316
01:29:25.208 --> 01:29:26.375
These things always do.

1317
01:29:27.791 --> 01:29:29.125
-Katie?
-Detective!

1318
01:29:31.916 --> 01:29:33.166
I'm Julia Byron-Kim.

1319
01:29:33.666 --> 01:29:35.125
I'm Ms. Franklin's attorney.

1320
01:29:35.916 --> 01:29:37.791
Well. Ms. Byron-Kim.

1321
01:29:38.416 --> 01:29:40.708
I'm gonna need you to step out
so I can see both your hands.

1322
01:29:40.791 --> 01:29:43.291
If you just give me a minute
to explain on behalf of my client.

1323
01:29:43.375 --> 01:29:44.875
Show me your hands. Right now!

1324
01:29:44.958 --> 01:29:46.583
All right.

1325
01:29:46.666 --> 01:29:49.000
-Detective. if you would just listen--
-Look out!

1326
01:30:02.750 --> 01:30:03.583
Stay back.

1327
01:30:09.625 --> 01:30:10.625
Are you okay?

1328
01:30:11.333 --> 01:30:12.375
Are you okay?

1329
01:30:12.916 --> 01:30:14.666
You're okay. sweetie. You're okay.

1330
01:30:15.541 --> 01:30:16.375
Come on.

1331
01:30:18.625 --> 01:30:20.625
Come on.
Let's get you out of here. come on.

1332
01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:26.958
This is Detective Chesler.

1333
01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.458
I'm requesting a back-up
and an ambulance

1334
01:30:30.750 --> 01:30:32.083
at 127 Queens.

1335
01:30:35.083 --> 01:30:38.833
FOUR MONTHS LATER

1336
01:30:56.083 --> 01:30:56.916
Katie.

1337
01:30:59.750 --> 01:31:00.875
-Hey.
-Detective.

1338
01:31:01.166 --> 01:31:02.750
Sorry. I tried knocking.

1339
01:31:04.875 --> 01:31:05.750
Sorry. I was...

1340
01:31:06.625 --> 01:31:07.875
a million miles away.

1341
01:31:08.166 --> 01:31:09.166
A young cedar.

1342
01:31:09.375 --> 01:31:10.500
This is a nice spot.

1343
01:31:10.916 --> 01:31:13.125
-Lots of sun.
-Yeah. I think so.

1344
01:31:14.333 --> 01:31:16.250
-It's good to see you.
-And it's good to see you.

1345
01:31:19.333 --> 01:31:20.500
You look beautiful.

1346
01:31:20.833 --> 01:31:21.666
Thank you.

1347
01:31:21.833 --> 01:31:22.875
Yeah. we're...

1348
01:31:23.625 --> 01:31:24.625
We're doing well.

1349
01:31:26.125 --> 01:31:30.458
Well I just came by to let you know
that the case is officially closed.

1350
01:31:31.875 --> 01:31:35.458
Mickey Hayden and Julia Byron-Kim
are the only suspects on record.

1351
01:31:36.125 --> 01:31:38.583
So your baby won't grow up
to someday find out

1352
01:31:38.666 --> 01:31:40.208
her father had a criminal history.

1353
01:31:41.666 --> 01:31:43.500
Thank you. Detective.

1354
01:31:47.250 --> 01:31:50.208
We've been through that place
a half a dozen times.

1355
01:31:50.541 --> 01:31:51.500
top to bottom.

1356
01:31:53.041 --> 01:31:54.375
Still can't figure it out.

1357
01:31:55.041 --> 01:31:56.083
He didn't tell me.

1358
01:31:56.750 --> 01:31:59.500
I really don't know
where Adam hid the diamonds.

1359
01:32:01.708 --> 01:32:03.333
I'm sorry. though. I wish I did.

1360
01:32:09.041 --> 01:32:10.500
Take care of yourself. Katie.

1361
01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:12.333
You too.
