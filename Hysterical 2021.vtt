"Strong Black woman"‐‐that never
felt like a compliment.

171
00:07:07.612 --> 00:07:10.585
That always felt like work.

172
00:07:10.651 --> 00:07:11.854
‐ [ laughter ]
‐ So it was like.

173
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.289
"Hey. what you doing
on Saturday?

174
00:07:13.356 --> 00:07:16.563
I got this heavy couch.
I need a strong Black woman."

175
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.399
[ laughter ]

176
00:07:18.466 --> 00:07:21.940
I used to be like. ugh.
when comedians would. like.

177
00:07:22.007 --> 00:07:23.042
pat themselves on the back
or like.

178
00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:25.113
"We are the last bastion
of free speech."

179
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.251
and it's like.
no. we kind of are.

180
00:07:27.317 --> 00:07:30.156
Naked pictures‐‐I send those.
and I shouldn't.

181
00:07:30.223 --> 00:07:32.261
I shouldn't.
The cloud is not secure.

182
00:07:32.327 --> 00:07:39.475
But. like. neither am I.
and I need constant validation.

183
00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:40.511
When someone tells me
I can't talk about something.

184
00:07:40.578 --> 00:07:42.247
I just. like. wanna do it more.

185
00:07:42.314 --> 00:07:44.318
I love "The Sixth Sense."
though.

186
00:07:44.385 --> 00:07:46.657
I love‐‐and the ending.
when the guy came in my eye.

187
00:07:46.723 --> 00:07:48.627
and I didn't have to watch
the rest of it. that was great.

188
00:07:48.694 --> 00:07:51.900
[ laughter ]

189
00:07:51.967 --> 00:07:56.743
In stand‐up. there is no one
telling us what to do.

[ faint laughter ]

191
00:08:09.134 --> 00:08:12.542
What is it that beats inside
the heart and soul of a comedian

192
00:08:12.609 --> 00:08:14.078
that makes you want to make
people laugh.

193
00:08:14.144 --> 00:08:16.883
that makes you want to stand
upstage alone?

194
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:23.129
Damage. [ laughing ]

195
00:08:23.196 --> 00:08:26.302
No. [ laughing ] I'm sorry.

196
00:08:26.369 --> 00:08:29.241
Um...no. I don't know.

197
00:08:29.308 --> 00:08:31.780
Yeah. there's probably a little
piece of a lot of us

198
00:08:31.847 --> 00:08:34.619
that is filling
some sort of void. right?

199
00:08:34.686 --> 00:08:36.657
[ indistinct conversations ]

200
00:08:36.723 --> 00:08:38.627
Where are you guys from?

201
00:08:38.694 --> 00:08:41.365
Here? Okay. what do you do?

202
00:08:41.432 --> 00:08:43.202
You're a social w‐‐
That's probably why

203
00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:45.040
you've been laughing so hard.
‐ [ laughter ]

204
00:08:45.106 --> 00:08:47.578
Yeah. my mother's a therapist.
too.

205
00:08:47.645 --> 00:08:49.148
Yeah. it's incredible.

206
00:08:49.214 --> 00:08:51.185
She saw clients in the basement
of my house my entire life.

207
00:08:51.252 --> 00:08:53.089
so I had to be quiet.
She'd be like.

208
00:08:53.156 --> 00:08:56.964
"Judy's coming today. and she's
having a really hard time.

209
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:58.968
"So I'm gonna need you
to be quiet upstairs.

210
00:08:59.034 --> 00:09:02.307
'cause Judy needs help.
Judy's really struggling."

211
00:09:02.374 --> 00:09:06.248
Ju‐‐ [ laughs ] I'm like.
"Well. I just ate six pizzas...

212
00:09:06.315 --> 00:09:09.221

but good luck to Judy."

00:09:09.288 --> 00:09:11.192
[ laughter ]

214
00:09:11.258 --> 00:09:12.929
Okay. um...

215
00:09:12.996 --> 00:09:14.264
I say this onstage as a joke.

216
00:09:14.331 --> 00:09:16.135
but. like.
people start clapping.

217
00:09:16.202 --> 00:09:17.538
I'm like. no matter how much
you clap.

218
00:09:17.605 --> 00:09:19.141
it'll never fill the hole.

219
00:09:19.208 --> 00:09:21.546
Like. we're just trying to fill
this hole

220
00:09:21.613 --> 00:09:22.782
and get the attention
that we've always wanted

221
00:09:22.849 --> 00:09:24.853
that we can't get.

222
00:09:24.919 --> 00:09:27.257
I think it really goes back
to childhood

223
00:09:27.324 --> 00:09:29.596
and just always wanting to be
seen and heard

224
00:09:29.663 --> 00:09:31.767
and not feeling acknowledged.

225
00:09:31.833 --> 00:09:34.238
I was not a happy kid.

226
00:09:34.304 --> 00:09:37.512
My parents weren't happy
together. and. you know.

227
00:09:37.578 --> 00:09:39.849
my father would be. like.
tough on me.

228
00:09:39.916 --> 00:09:42.588
so I just kept thinking
I'm bad. I'm wrong.

229
00:09:42.655 --> 00:09:44.759
I used to fight boys every day
after school.

230
00:09:44.826 --> 00:09:48.934
and I would normally not win.

231
00:09:49.001 --> 00:09:51.807
I was very tomboyish.

232
00:09:51.873 --> 00:09:55.447
no interest in dolls.
really tall.

233
00:09:55.514 --> 00:09:57.985
I got teased from the minute
I got up

234
00:09:58.052 --> 00:10:01.025
to the minute I came home
from school.

235
00:10:01.092 --> 00:10:02.394
6'3". I'm very tall.
That is kinda tall.

236
00:10:02.461 --> 00:10:04.566
Actually.
I reached this height‐‐

237
00:10:04.632 --> 00:10:06.469
I was about 13 years old.
which was horrible.

238
00:10:06.536 --> 00:10:08.106
'cause I'd walk down the halls
in grammar school.

239
00:10:08.172 --> 00:10:09.408
Everyone called me "Sasquatch"
and everything. right?

240
00:10:09.475 --> 00:10:11.713
‐ I didn't know what to do.
‐ [ laughter ]

241
00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.116
Yeah. thanks a lot.

242
00:10:13.182 --> 00:10:14.619
Then I'd go home to my mother.

243
00:10:14.686 --> 00:10:16.455
I'd be like. "Mom. all the kids
are teasing me in school.

244
00:10:16.523 --> 00:10:18.694
I don't know what to do."
She'd say to me...

245
00:10:18.761 --> 00:10:20.230
[ sighs heavily ]

246
00:10:20.296 --> 00:10:22.300
"Judith. don't worry about it.
They're jealous of you.

247
00:10:22.367 --> 00:10:23.971
"Go upstairs and put on
your father's clothes.

248
00:10:24.037 --> 00:10:25.206
"Leave me alone.
Get away from me.

249
00:10:25.273 --> 00:10:27.444
I can't stand your pain."
‐ [ laughter ]

250
00:10:27.512 --> 00:10:29.214
Yeah. I got bullied a lot.
We moved‐‐

251
00:10:29.281 --> 00:10:30.851
my family‐‐
my dad moved my family

252
00:10:30.918 --> 00:10:33.156
to the suburbs of Chicago.

253
00:10:33.222 --> 00:10:34.391
So there wasn't
many Black people.

254
00:10:34.458 --> 00:10:36.062
and it was very prejudiced.
so. you know.

255
00:10:36.128 --> 00:10:38.600
I got called the "N" word
all the time.

256
00:10:38.667 --> 00:10:43.042
I didn't like to fight.
I didn't like confrontation.

257
00:10:43.109 --> 00:10:44.078
So I was always the one
that came in

258
00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:45.881
and tried to make people laugh.

259
00:10:45.948 --> 00:10:48.587
But I didn't know
what I wanted to do.

260
00:10:48.654 --> 00:10:51.025
My family felt
I should play it safe.

261
00:10:51.092 --> 00:10:53.262
get something where you don't
get fired.

262
00:10:53.329 --> 00:10:56.469
So I chose to be
a legal secretary.

263
00:10:56.536 --> 00:10:58.507
This is like eons ago.

264
00:10:58.574 --> 00:11:01.613
I come from
a very traditional family.

265
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.184
I grew up in Spain
and moved to the states

266
00:11:04.251 --> 00:11:06.455
when I was 8. and I was very shy

267
00:11:06.523 --> 00:11:08.392
'cause I would say things
incorrectly.

268
00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:10.865
and then someone would laugh.
Like. I would just be like.

269
00:11:10.931 --> 00:11:13.302
well. I'm not gonna
speak up then.

270
00:11:13.369 --> 00:11:18.781
To my family.
I was a very strange person.

271
00:11:18.847 --> 00:11:20.216
I liked things they didn't like.

272
00:11:20.283 --> 00:11:22.655
I found humor in things
that they didn't find funny.

273
00:11:22.722 --> 00:11:23.824
They were very hard‐working.

274
00:11:23.891 --> 00:11:25.126
We grew up on a farm.

275
00:11:25.193 --> 00:11:27.230
For a long time.
we didn't have running water.

276
00:11:27.297 --> 00:11:29.569
I. uh. I'm from Canada.
I grew up on a farm there.

277
00:11:29.636 --> 00:11:31.873
and I live in here
but. you know.

278
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.042
everyone back home's
always like.

279
00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:34.546
"Hey. don't go Hollywood."

280
00:11:34.612 --> 00:11:37.083
I'm like. I wanna
go Hollywood. you know?

281
00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:38.554
‐ [ laughter ]
‐ I wanna have it all.

282
00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:41.793
I wanna have a convertible.
a car phone. a drug addiction.

283
00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.062
[ laughter ]

284
00:11:43.129 --> 00:11:44.666
I just have to get
a convertible.

285
00:11:44.732 --> 00:11:47.003
[ laughter ]

286
00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:48.707
I am this close.

287
00:11:48.774 --> 00:11:51.913
Everyone assumes you're kind of
the class clown that's. like.

288
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.082
"Look at me. look at me."

289
00:11:53.149 --> 00:11:55.019
But I was a cautious kid.

290
00:11:55.086 --> 00:11:57.925
My mom said I would always
look both ways

291
00:11:57.992 --> 00:12:00.163
before crossing the street.

292
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:05.306
So it's weird that I ended up
in this job that has

293
00:12:05.373 --> 00:12:06.643
such a lack of stability.

294
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:09.983
and you're having to take risks
all the time.

295
00:12:10.049 --> 00:12:13.189
I grew up in the suburbs
of Dallas. Texas.

296
00:12:13.256 --> 00:12:15.026
for many years. with. like.
a single mom.

297
00:12:15.093 --> 00:12:16.630
And I moved schools a lot.

298
00:12:16.696 --> 00:12:19.636
so I definitely never felt like
I fit in.

299
00:12:19.702 --> 00:12:21.438
especially growing up
in Dallas. Texas.

300
00:12:21.506 --> 00:12:23.944
Like. all the girls had bangs.
They were perfect. Christian.

301
00:12:24.011 --> 00:12:25.648
And then it was. like. me.

302
00:12:25.714 --> 00:12:27.017
You did wear an eye patch
as a child.

303
00:12:27.083 --> 00:12:29.021
‐ I did.
‐ I know that about you.

304
00:12:29.087 --> 00:12:30.156
I had something called
amblyopia.

305
00:12:30.223 --> 00:12:31.292
‐ Right.
‐ Which affects a lot of people.

306
00:12:31.358 --> 00:12:32.695
‐ Really?
‐ And so I had an eye patch.

307
00:12:32.762 --> 00:12:34.732
and then I had a special one
that went over my glasses.

308
00:12:34.799 --> 00:12:36.235
‐ Oh. no.
‐ I went to a private school.

309
00:12:36.302 --> 00:12:38.507
In private school. like.
no one makes fun of anyone

310
00:12:38.574 --> 00:12:39.776
because it's‐‐
'cause public school.

311
00:12:39.842 --> 00:12:41.846
it's like. "Yeah!
You know. think fast. nerd."

312
00:12:41.913 --> 00:12:43.249
‐ Right.
‐ And in private school.

313
00:12:43.316 --> 00:12:44.284
it's like. "We don't know
how rich your parents are.

314
00:12:44.351 --> 00:12:45.821
so let's err on the side
of caution."

315
00:12:45.888 --> 00:12:47.558
[ laughter and applause ]

316
00:12:47.625 --> 00:12:51.733
I was. like. an emergency moron
in school.

317
00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.037
Like. I mean. they didn't know
what to do.

318
00:12:54.104 --> 00:12:58.179
There was a lot of meetings
about me. just like Ds. Fs.

319
00:12:58.246 --> 00:12:59.716
They were just like.
"Uh. yeah. she's‐‐

320
00:12:59.782 --> 00:13:02.287
I mean. we don't know why
she's dumb."

321
00:13:02.354 --> 00:13:05.460
I loved voices.
I loved affectations

322
00:13:05.527 --> 00:13:07.430
and how people speak.
so since I was little.

323
00:13:07.498 --> 00:13:10.069
I would get attention
that way.

324
00:13:10.136 --> 00:13:11.706
But I couldn't learn.

325
00:13:11.773 --> 00:13:14.579
I couldn't stuff information
in my brain.

326
00:13:14.646 --> 00:13:16.482
so I moved to New York
when I was 17

327
00:13:16.549 --> 00:13:20.891
with this guy and his band
called Dick Sister.

328
00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:24.031
All I knew is that I really
loved stand‐up comedy.

329
00:13:24.097 --> 00:13:25.935
I love the artform
and I knew that I was

330
00:13:26.001 --> 00:13:29.408
meant to do it
in some capacity.

331
00:13:29.474 --> 00:13:32.280
But there was
no real aspirations

332
00:13:32.347 --> 00:13:36.255
of stardom or success.
'cause I'd never seen

333
00:13:36.322 --> 00:13:38.694
Asian Americans do that.
and I'd never seen.

334
00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.499
really. that many women
doing that.

335
00:13:41.566 --> 00:13:45.373
You know. maybe I would get
to open for a big star

336
00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.243
when they came

was by being funny.

My mother was a big yeller.
She was‐‐had a lot of rage.
