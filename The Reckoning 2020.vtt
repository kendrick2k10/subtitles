3
00:04:39.905 --> 00:04:42.738
I think it's perfect.

4
00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:52.451
I made it for you.

5
00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:57.291
When I can't watch over
you both. he will.

6
00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:59.204
As he always does.

7
00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:54.218
You sure I can't
persuade you to stay?

8
00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:59.522
I wish I could.

9
00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:09.069
I don't like it when you leave.

10
00:06:10.328 --> 00:06:13.240
Especially with what's
going on out there.

11
00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:25.711
I won't be long. love.

12
00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:41.681
That's it. It's all there.

13
00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:43.521
Good man.

14
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.777
Oh. thanks. Ben.

15
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.417
Cheers. Cheers.

16
00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:07.253
Joseph.

17
00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:08.508
Squire.

18
00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:09.838
How's that family of yours?

19
00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:11.344
Very well.

20
00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:13.075
In times like these.
that's blessing enough.

21
00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:14.930
In times like these.
I wouldn't let a woman

22
00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:16.716
like grave out of my sight.

23
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.761
Here. let me light your pipe.

24
00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:20.019
Oh. thank you.

25
00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:21.646
Leave him be. leonora.

26
00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:23.807
He's a married man.

27
00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:38.112
Man: Jesus.

28
00:07:56.935 --> 00:07:58.766
Joseph?

29
00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:00.723
It's okay my love.
Just go back to bed.

30
00:08:02.774 --> 00:08:06.642
No. grace. Stay where you are.
Don't come any closer.

31
00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:09.607
Joseph. you're scaring me.
What's wrong?

32
00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:11.863
Don't touch me! Please.

33
00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:14.445
Oh. my god. It's the sickness.

34
00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:15.950
I just have a fever is all.

35
00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:18.783
I don't want you and Abby
succumbing to it.

36
00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:20.413
All right.

37
00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:24.576
I'll go to the forest to fetch
some elderberry

38
00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:26.165
to make a tonic.

39
00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:28.500
That should help
break the fever.

40
00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:37.681
Grace... grace.

41
00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:40.684
I love you.

42
00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:42.811
Won't be long.

43
00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:42.407
Sorry. The squire wants
a word with you.

44
00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:44.864
- Squire?
- Mrs. haverstock.

45
00:11:44.913 --> 00:11:47.074
You don't usually make
house calls.

46
00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:48.988
Well. I heard rumor
that your husband

47
00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:51.499
had succumbed to the sickness.

48
00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:53.830
Such a pity that he should be
cut down in his prime.

49
00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.963
But then the lord moves
in mysterious ways.

50
00:11:57.008 --> 00:11:58.498
That he does.

51
00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:01.884
And what of yourself
and the child?

52
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:06.515
We must wait it out in solitude
and pray the lord has spared us.

53
00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:09.096
And if you do find yourself
in his favor. what then?

54
00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:11.181
Surely you don't mean
to persist out here.

55
00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:14.143
a frail young woman alone
in this isolated place?

56
00:12:14.192 --> 00:12:16.274
I'm not alone.
I have my daughter.

57
00:12:16.319 --> 00:12:18.935
And there is work to be done.
I must persist.

58
00:12:18.988 --> 00:12:20.603
I see.

59
00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:22.989
And I trust you'll be able
to pay the rent.

60
00:12:23.034 --> 00:12:26.151
It's due in a week. and if you
cannot fulfill your obligation.

61
00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:27.740
your tenancy will be forfeit.

62
00:12:27.789 --> 00:12:29.575
You'll lose everything.

63
00:12:29.624 --> 00:12:32.286
Your sympathy at this difficult
time is the most touching.

64
00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:33.495
Mind your tongue. woman.

65
00:12:33.544 --> 00:12:35.535
My sympathies lie
where I choose.

66
00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:37.874
This is business
and nothing more.

67
00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:39.880
We all have our stations
in life.

68
00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:42.154
and I'm sorry that yours is
beneath mine. but there it is.

69
00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:43.572
I'll come back.
If you're still alive.

70
00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:45.678
I shall expect
the rent paid in full.

71
00:12:45.723 --> 00:12:49.261
If not. well. then we'll
call it quits.

72
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:51.551
Don't worry. squire.

73
00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:54.266
You'll have your money.

74
00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:39.368
It happened this time.

75
00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.287
I'm sure of it.

76
00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.047
Sure of what?

77
00:14:45.093 --> 00:14:46.754
Of a child.

78
00:14:46.803 --> 00:14:49.636
How could you possibly
know that?

79
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.797
A woman just knows these things.

80
00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:19.999
Come here.

81
00:15:51.826 --> 00:15:52.986
Kate?

82
00:15:53.035 --> 00:15:54.866
Grace?

83
00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:01.119
Oh.

84
00:16:01.169 --> 00:16:02.579
It's all right. Kate.

85
00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:04.584
We've gone a week now
and showed no signs.

86
00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.470
All the same. Kate.
it might be wise to keep...

87
00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:08.919
Thank the lord. Never mind.

88
00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:11.334
When we heard the news.
we feared the worst.

89
00:16:11.387 --> 00:16:13.719
We're glad to see that
you're all right.

90
00:16:13.764 --> 00:16:15.200
We're very sorry
to hear about Joseph.

91
00:16:15.224 --> 00:16:16.634
He were a good friend.

92
00:16:16.684 --> 00:16:18.640
Thank you. Morton.
That means a lot.

93
00:16:18.686 --> 00:16:20.802
- Where are you going?
- I have to go into town.

94
00:16:20.855 --> 00:16:22.811
Grace. no! It's too dangerous.

95
00:16:22.857 --> 00:16:26.065
The sickness is rife there.
Morton. she's going into town.

96
00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.476
Well. why would you want to do
a damn fool thing like that?

97
00:16:28.529 --> 00:16:30.065
I have no choice.

98
00:16:30.114 --> 00:16:31.445
That's something I must do.

99
00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:33.948
Then leave Abby with me.

100
00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:35.449
No. You can ride faster

101
00:16:35.495 --> 00:16:37.861
and be back sooner.

102
00:16:37.914 --> 00:16:39.279
Very well.

103
00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:41.618
You and Morton have been
like family to me

104
00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:43.498
ever since I came here.

105
00:16:43.544 --> 00:16:47.787
Then take some sisterly advice
and don't dally.

106
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:51.207
The shadow of death
hangs over that place.

107
00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.002
Come on.

108
00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:58.965
I won't be there a moment
longer necessary.

109
00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:03.933
I'll be back before dark.

110
00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:49.663
Mr. tuttle?

111
00:18:49.712 --> 00:18:52.875
Aye? That's right.

112
00:18:52.923 --> 00:18:56.086
You don't know me. but you were
a friend of my husband's.

113
00:18:56.135 --> 00:18:58.217
Joseph haverstock.

114
00:18:58.262 --> 00:19:02.676
That I was. It's a bloody shame
what happened.

115
00:19:02.725 --> 00:19:04.761
I'm sorry for your loss.

116
00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:08.428
He always did right by you.
didn't he?

117
00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:11.143
Why don't you come to the point.
Mrs. haverstock?

118
00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:16.482
I hate to come here like this.

119
00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:19.272
I didn't know
where else to turn.

120
00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:21.737
I need money.

121
00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:24.698
A small loan.

122
00:19:24.747 --> 00:19:27.705
I see.

123
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.742
I can't help you.

124
00:19:30.795 --> 00:19:32.660
But...

125
00:19:32.713 --> 00:19:34.328
The squire will evict us
if we don't pay.

126
00:19:34.382 --> 00:19:35.542
Times are tough.

127
00:19:35.591 --> 00:19:37.047
What must I do? Beg?

128
00:19:37.093 --> 00:19:40.961
Begging won't make
any difference.

129
00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:44.255
It's the sickness.
People are scared.

130
00:19:44.308 --> 00:19:46.048
They're seeing the devil
under their beds

131
00:19:46.102 --> 00:19:47.808
or hiding in the woodshed.

132
00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:50.765
He arrested Molly pryor
just two days ago for witchery.

133
00:19:50.815 --> 00:19:53.773
Molly pryor?
She's just a harmless old woman.

134
00:19:53.818 --> 00:19:56.275
She confessed to all charges.

135
00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.982
I'll give you some advice
because Joseph was my friend

136
00:19:59.031 --> 00:20:01.898
and he didn't deserve
to go the way I did.

137
00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:05.660
Leave town while you can.

138
00:20:16.924 --> 00:20:21.588
That day when Joseph
came into town. what happened?

139
00:20:21.637 --> 00:20:23.298
He delivered the grain.

140
00:20:23.347 --> 00:20:26.885
then came in for a drink.
as usual.

141
00:20:26.934 --> 00:20:28.578
But there was a man here
from outside the village

142
00:20:28.602 --> 00:20:31.685
with the sickness.

143
00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:35.690
Joseph drank from the wrong cup.

144
00:20:35.735 --> 00:20:39.023
An honest mistake.

145
00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:42.154
And from that moment.
he was done for.

146
00:20:42.199 --> 00:20:44.155
You saw this?

147
00:20:44.785 --> 00:20:46.366
I heard it.

148
00:20:46.412 --> 00:20:48.243
From who?

149
00:20:50.166 --> 00:20:52.578
Well. the squire. of course.

150
00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:12.761
Man: Come on.

151
00:22:43.863 --> 00:22:46.024
Do as you must. love.

152
00:23:08.178 --> 00:23:10.544
Grace.

153
00:24:10.449 --> 00:24:12.360
Good morning. Mrs. haverstock.

154
00:24:12.409 --> 00:24:13.774
Suppose you've come
for your money.

155
00:24:13.827 --> 00:24:16.910
All in good time.
Mind if I come in?

156
00:24:17.665 --> 00:24:22.910
Never fails to impress me how
so many can live on so little.

157
00:24:22.962 --> 00:24:24.293
How are you holding up?

158
00:24:24.338 --> 00:24:26.294
I can only imagine
how difficult it is

159
00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:28.171
with all you've been through.

160
00:24:30.135 --> 00:24:32.547
We're getting by.

161
00:24:32.596 --> 00:24:35.463
Could I trouble you
for a libation?

162
00:24:35.516 --> 00:24:37.427
We only have ale.

163
00:24:37.476 --> 00:24:39.967
A cool ale would hit the spot.

164
00:24:42.189 --> 00:24:44.805
Poor child.

165
00:24:44.858 --> 00:24:48.396
Won't be easy for her
growing up without a father.

166
00:24:48.445 --> 00:24:50.106
Having suffered
the loss of my own mother

167
00:24:50.155 --> 00:24:52.988
as a child. I do believe
it deprived my character

168
00:24:53.033 --> 00:24:56.742
of the more tender sentiments.

169
00:24:56.787 --> 00:24:58.527
I'm sorry.

170
00:24:58.580 --> 00:24:59.911
About your mother. I mean.

171
00:24:59.957 --> 00:25:02.164
Oh. don't be. She was a whore.

172
00:25:02.209 --> 00:25:04.165
My father beat her to death
with an iron skillet

173
00:25:04.211 --> 00:25:09.001
when he caught her looking
at another man.

174
00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:11.040
Cheers.

175
00:25:11.093 --> 00:25:16.008
Eviction is such thirsty work.

176
00:25:16.056 --> 00:25:20.720
Then this should keep
you imbibed for a while.

177
00:25:20.769 --> 00:25:24.353
For three months at least.

178
00:25:24.398 --> 00:25:27.185
I'm impressed.

179
00:25:27.234 --> 00:25:29.850
What about the next month
and the month after?

180
00:25:29.903 --> 00:25:31.673
Surely you don't expect me to
believe that you're going to

181
00:25:31.697 --> 00:25:33.091
work this land whilst
tending to an infant...

182
00:25:33.115 --> 00:25:35.447
- We'll manage.
- And you'll fail.

183
00:25:35.492 --> 00:25:39.861
All you will have achieved
is to delay the inevitable.

184
00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:58.045
Another three months.

185
00:26:02.186 --> 00:26:04.222
Satisfied?

186
00:26:06.857 --> 00:26:09.394
Doesn't have to be this way.

187
00:26:09.443 --> 00:26:10.899
An arrangement could be reached.

188
00:26:10.944 --> 00:26:12.900
You could cover your rent by...

189
00:26:12.946 --> 00:26:16.188
Other means.

190
00:26:16.241 --> 00:26:18.277
Other means?

191
00:26:18.327 --> 00:26:21.239
Well. let's not mince words.

192
00:26:21.288 --> 00:26:24.121
You have your money.
Now please leave.

193
00:26:32.758 --> 00:26:34.294
You should count

194
00:26:34.343 --> 00:26:35.958
yourself bloody lucky.

195
00:26:36.011 --> 00:26:38.468
You think I make an offer
like this to just anyone.

196
00:26:38.514 --> 00:26:40.800
Get off or me!

197
00:26:40.849 --> 00:26:43.966
Get your hands off of me!

198
00:26:45.104 --> 00:26:48.346
I saw how you were with Joseph.
flaunting your tender body

199
00:26:48.398 --> 00:26:50.764
like bait on a fishhook.
reeling him in

200
00:26:50.818 --> 00:26:52.274
with the promise
of succulent quim.

201
00:26:52.319 --> 00:26:54.776
Grace: Please stop this!

202
00:26:54.822 --> 00:26:57.655
You can feel me. can't you?

203
00:26:57.699 --> 00:27:00.156
Get off of me!

204
00:27:00.202 --> 00:27:02.193
Get out!

205
00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.571
You're hardly in a position
to be choosy.

206
00:27:05.624 --> 00:27:07.785
not after your husband's
misfortune.

207
00:27:07.835 --> 00:27:09.291
Get out.

208
00:27:09.336 --> 00:27:11.042
Make me.

209
00:27:14.633 --> 00:27:17.295
You got some fight in you.
I like that.

210
00:27:19.763 --> 00:27:21.549
That's more like it.

211
00:27:21.598 --> 00:27:24.260
On your knees. Relax.

212
00:27:24.309 --> 00:27:26.971
You might even enjoy it.

213
00:27:36.613 --> 00:27:38.023
Aaah!

214
00:27:42.578 --> 00:27:46.412
Now get the hell
out of my house!

215
00:27:46.456 --> 00:27:49.448
Come here. you little shit!
Aaah!

216
00:27:57.009 --> 00:27:58.920
You'll pay for this. harlot.

217
00:27:58.969 --> 00:28:00.755
Ha!

218
00:28:00.804 --> 00:28:02.465
Come on.

219
00:28:18.488 --> 00:28:22.481
They murdered her.

220
00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:24.650
What re you talking about?

221
00:28:24.703 --> 00:28:27.570
I never told you
about my mother.

222
00:28:27.623 --> 00:28:29.454
I was very young.

223
00:28:29.499 --> 00:28:33.458
It was early on the sabbath
when they came for.

224
00:28:33.503 --> 00:28:34.993
My father tried to stop them.

225
00:28:35.047 --> 00:28:38.380
but he was helpless
to prevent it.

226
00:28:38.425 --> 00:28:40.632
A few days later we were
summoned to blackthorne castle

227
00:28:40.677 --> 00:28:42.668
to hear the verdict.

228
00:28:44.014 --> 00:28:46.175
The whole village came out.

229
00:28:46.225 --> 00:28:48.341
They were too afraid not to.

230
00:28:49.019 --> 00:28:53.888
For fear of judge moorcroft.
the witch finder.

231
00:28:56.026 --> 00:28:59.143
Would you let your shame fall on
your daughter's shoulders?

232
00:28:59.196 --> 00:29:00.902
Don't you dare hurt her!

233
00:29:00.948 --> 00:29:04.941
Then confess. or you condemn
her as you condemn yourself.

234
00:29:04.993 --> 00:29:06.779
All right. I confess.

235
00:29:06.828 --> 00:29:08.238
I didn't hear you.

236
00:29:08.288 --> 00:29:11.030
I confess. damn you!

237
00:29:11.083 --> 00:29:12.869
Moorcroft declared
my mother a witch

238
00:29:12.918 --> 00:29:15.000
and sentenced her to death.

239
00:29:15.045 --> 00:29:16.410
Burn her.

240
00:29:16.463 --> 00:29:20.251
I didn't understand
what was happening.

241
00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.416
All I knew is that they were
taking away my mother.

242
00:29:22.469 --> 00:29:26.132
I'm sorry. grace.
I wasn't strong enough.

243
00:29:26.181 --> 00:29:28.422
Don't be afraid.

244
00:29:28.475 --> 00:29:31.137
Promise me. always stay
true to yourself.

245
00:29:31.186 --> 00:29:33.142
Let no one tell you who you are.

246
00:29:33.188 --> 00:29:35.850
Take her away.

247
00:29:35.899 --> 00:29:38.231
And I had to watch.

248
00:29:38.277 --> 00:29:39.483
Please!

249
00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:43.315
As they burned her alive.

250
00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:53.288
I should have told you.

251
00:29:53.333 --> 00:29:55.198
You deserve to know who I am.

252
00:29:55.252 --> 00:29:58.210
I know who you are.

253
00:29:58.255 --> 00:30:00.086
And I love you.

254
00:30:03.969 --> 00:30:08.588
This. us...

255
00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.881
It's all that matters.

256
00:30:10.934 --> 00:30:14.267
You and the baby are
the most precious thing to me.

257
00:30:14.313 --> 00:30:16.929
I'll do anything
to keep you safe.

258
00:30:18.233 --> 00:30:20.269
I know.

259
00:30:21.194 --> 00:30:24.778
Your mother...

260
00:30:24.823 --> 00:30:26.404
She was innocent.

261
00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:30.363
It doesn't matter.
Innocent or not. she confessed.

262
00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:35.076
That makes her a witch.

263
00:30:37.753 --> 00:30:42.622
Ale. Make it quick.

264
00:30:43.467 --> 00:30:45.332
Rough day. squire?

265
00:30:45.385 --> 00:30:47.922
Keep your insolent tongue
inside your wretched head.

266
00:30:47.971 --> 00:30:49.677
Just asking. squire.

267
00:30:49.723 --> 00:30:53.056
It was that damn haverstock
woman. if you must know.

268
00:30:53.101 --> 00:30:54.329
I only went round
to collect the rent.

269
00:30:54.353 --> 00:30:55.934
She flew into a rage
and attacked me.

270
00:30:55.979 --> 00:30:57.515
The woman's a menace.

271
00:30:57.564 --> 00:30:59.555
You mean she doesn't fancy you?

272
00:30:59.608 --> 00:31:01.394
It's written all over
your face. squire.

273
00:31:01.443 --> 00:31:03.559
One more word.

274
00:31:03.612 --> 00:31:05.773
Your rent's coming up soon.
isn't it?

275
00:31:05.822 --> 00:31:08.564
I'd hate to have to it raise it.
That goes for all of you!

276
00:31:08.617 --> 00:31:10.027
I own you!

277
00:31:10.077 --> 00:31:12.284
Remember that!

278
00:31:12.329 --> 00:31:16.447
What I mean is. does anyone
know what really happened

279
00:31:17.709 --> 00:31:19.119
she claims the sickness
took him.

280
00:31:19.169 --> 00:31:21.000
But what about her
and her baby. too?

281
00:31:21.046 --> 00:31:23.207
I tell you.

282
00:31:23.256 --> 00:31:26.498
There's something wicked
at work in that place.

283
00:31:30.013 --> 00:31:32.550
I saw her in town the other day.

284
00:31:32.599 --> 00:31:34.555
Acting bloody peculiar. she was.

285
00:31:34.601 --> 00:31:38.093
She and Molly pryor were
close friends. I heard tell.

286
00:31:38.146 --> 00:31:41.934
Woman: Joseph was showing me
interest until she came along.

287
00:31:41.983 --> 00:31:43.848
She must have beguiled him.

288
00:31:43.902 --> 00:31:46.109
There's only one thing
that can explain it.

289
00:31:46.154 --> 00:31:48.065
She made a pact with the devil.

290
00:31:48.115 --> 00:31:50.481
Grace haverstock's a witch.

291
00:31:50.534 --> 00:31:54.152
She came here looking for money.
I sent her away.

292
00:31:54.204 --> 00:31:56.069
Then I reckon
you're fucked. mate.

293
00:31:56.123 --> 00:31:58.284
She and Molly were in league.

294
00:31:58.333 --> 00:32:00.415
Killing one witch didn't
rid us of the sickness.

295
00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:03.247
Then we burn her. too.

296
00:32:03.296 --> 00:32:06.629
Did somebody say witch?

297
00:32:16.893 --> 00:32:20.260
Shh. shh. shh.

298
00:32:26.111 --> 00:32:28.727
Shh. shh. shh.

299
00:33:17.996 --> 00:33:20.408
Sleep soundly. my little one.

300
00:34:36.491 --> 00:34:40.325
Got to prime it first.
or don't work so good.

301
00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:41.556
Grace: Who are you?
What do you want?

302
00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:43.491
We want you. witch.

303
00:34:46.793 --> 00:34:48.283
Aaah!

304
00:34:48.336 --> 00:34:50.952
Witch!

305
00:34:51.506 --> 00:34:53.246
She's a feisty one. isn't she?

306
00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:55.461
Nowhere to run. witch.

307
00:35:33.923 --> 00:35:35.709
Yeah. look.

308
00:35:35.759 --> 00:35:38.501
She bleeds like the rest of us.

309
00:35:38.553 --> 00:35:40.043
Let's go.

310
00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:48.643
No sense taking any chances.

311
00:36:03.745 --> 00:36:05.906
Now. that's how you
deal with witches.

312
00:36:11.419 --> 00:36:14.536
No! What have you done?

313
00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:15.999
You were supposed
to bring her in.

314
00:36:16.049 --> 00:36:17.914
not but the house to the ground.

315
00:36:17.967 --> 00:36:19.779
She was going to burn anyway.
so what's the difference?

316
00:36:19.803 --> 00:36:23.091
It's my property. you moron.

317
00:36:29.521 --> 00:36:32.888
Morton. how could you?
What are you doing?

318
00:36:32.941 --> 00:36:34.727
Alright. well. she's dead now.

319
00:36:34.776 --> 00:36:36.186
So naught can be done about it.

320
00:36:36.236 --> 00:36:37.942
She's not bloody dead.
you useless fools!

321
00:36:37.987 --> 00:36:39.978
She escaped down the back.

322
00:36:40.031 --> 00:36:41.384
I should have known
it wouldn't be so easy

323
00:36:41.408 --> 00:36:43.239
to rid ourselves of you.

324
00:36:43.284 --> 00:36:46.526
Grace haverstock. you stand
accused of the crimes

325
00:36:46.579 --> 00:36:50.197
of witchcraft and making
unholy covenant with the devil.

326
00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:51.956
What say you to these charges?

327
00:36:52.001 --> 00:36:53.604
Bring me the child.

328
00:36:53.628 --> 00:36:57.541
No! No! No! Not my baby!

329
00:36:58.842 --> 00:37:00.707
Grace!

330
00:37:01.886 --> 00:37:04.218
Quit your struggling. =-no!

331
00:37:07.642 --> 00:37:11.055
- So innocent.
- No! My baby!

332
00:37:11.104 --> 00:37:13.937
Won't harm a hair on her head.

333
00:37:28.872 --> 00:37:31.238
Abby!

334
00:38:03.615 --> 00:38:06.652
What's this then? Another witch?

335
00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:42.725
- Got another witch for you.
- Ah.

336
00:38:42.779 --> 00:38:43.939
I'm no witch.

337
00:38:43.988 --> 00:38:45.603
That's what they
all say. darling.

338
00:38:45.657 --> 00:38:48.649
Not often we get one
as fine as you down here.

339
00:38:48.701 --> 00:38:50.362
Hey! Come on.

340
00:38:50.411 --> 00:38:52.902
You! You can see it. can't you?

341
00:38:52.956 --> 00:38:56.119
The seeds of our destruction
have already taken root.

342
00:38:56.167 --> 00:38:57.623
Shut it. you!

343
00:38:57.669 --> 00:38:59.409
Come on. don't make this
any bloody harder.

344
00:38:59.462 --> 00:39:01.453
Come on.
Don't keep on struggling.

345
00:39:01.506 --> 00:39:05.545
Right. Here. give me that.

346
00:39:05.593 --> 00:39:08.426
Yes. and enemy who sowed them
is the devil.

347
00:39:08.471 --> 00:39:10.427
For the harvest is
the close of the age.

348
00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:15.596
Welcome to paradise.

349
00:39:20.984 --> 00:39:23.066
I want to see my baby.

350
00:39:23.111 --> 00:39:24.851
I want to see my daughter.

351
00:39:25.864 --> 00:39:27.729
Damn you!

352
00:39:35.498 --> 00:39:37.910
How could you?

353
00:39:37.959 --> 00:39:41.910
She's your friend.

354
00:39:41.963 --> 00:39:43.248
At least she was.

355
00:39:43.298 --> 00:39:44.879
What do you mean by that?

356
00:39:44.924 --> 00:39:46.277
Morton: You'll have nothing more
to do with her.

357
00:39:46.301 --> 00:39:47.666
Do you understand?

358
00:39:47.719 --> 00:39:49.550
The squire would take away
everything we had

359
00:39:49.596 --> 00:39:51.198
if he knew we were associated
with that witch.

360
00:39:51.222 --> 00:39:53.508
But grace is not a witch!

361
00:39:53.558 --> 00:39:55.389
Enough!

362
00:39:58.229 --> 00:39:59.844
I'll hear no more of it.

363
00:39:59.898 --> 00:40:03.982
Or do you want to be chained
up alongside your friend?

364
00:40:05.486 --> 00:40:07.477
All it takes is a word.

365
00:41:22.689 --> 00:41:25.101
Mama?

366
00:41:43.459 --> 00:41:45.199
- Wait.
- I can't stay.

367
00:41:45.253 --> 00:41:46.993
A moment. that's all I ask.

368
00:41:47.046 --> 00:41:49.287
I'm forbidden to speak to you.

369
00:42:12.447 --> 00:42:15.189
Psst.

370
00:42:15.241 --> 00:42:17.903
Are you okay?

371
00:42:17.952 --> 00:42:20.113
It's okay. They've gone now.

372
00:42:20.913 --> 00:42:22.699
What's your name?

373
00:42:22.749 --> 00:42:24.535
Astrid.

374
00:42:24.584 --> 00:42:26.415
Where's your family. Astrid?

375
00:42:26.461 --> 00:42:28.417
Astrid: They're all gone.

376
00:42:28.463 --> 00:42:31.580
The sickness took them.

377
00:42:31.632 --> 00:42:33.839
I'm so sorry.

378
00:42:39.682 --> 00:42:42.594
You don't look much
like a thief.

379
00:42:42.643 --> 00:42:45.225
What'd you do to end up in here?

380
00:42:45.271 --> 00:42:46.977
Nothing.

381
00:42:47.023 --> 00:42:48.604
Astrid: That's what I told them.

382
00:42:48.649 --> 00:42:51.482
But they beat me.

383
00:42:51.527 --> 00:42:54.360
And kept on beating me
till I confessed

384
00:42:54.405 --> 00:42:56.942
to stealing a chicken
and a loaf of bread.

385
00:42:58.493 --> 00:43:02.156
But I was starving.
I had no choice.

386
00:43:04.749 --> 00:43:07.240
Soul of Christ. sanctify me.

387
00:43:07.293 --> 00:43:09.454
Blood of Christ. wash me.

388
00:43:09.504 --> 00:43:11.415
Body of Christ save me!

389
00:43:11.464 --> 00:43:13.546
Blood of Christ. inebriate me.

390
00:43:13.591 --> 00:43:14.922
And him?

391
00:43:14.967 --> 00:43:18.710
Reverend Malcolm.
he's out of his mind.

392
00:43:18.763 --> 00:43:20.424
He talks to himself
day and night.

393
00:43:20.473 --> 00:43:23.886
He thinks that the sickness
is the devil's work.

394
00:43:23.935 --> 00:43:28.429
that the end of times is here.

395
00:43:28.481 --> 00:43:32.440
You must be strong tomorrow.

396
00:43:32.485 --> 00:43:35.022
What's to happen to me?

397
00:43:35.071 --> 00:43:37.904
They'll try to break you.

398
00:43:37.949 --> 00:43:41.032
Like they did to poor old Molly.

399
00:43:41.077 --> 00:43:43.318
And the rest of us.

400
00:43:44.872 --> 00:43:49.616
Sooner or later.
he breaks everyone.

401
00:43:49.669 --> 00:43:53.753
You mustn't let him.

402
00:43:57.802 --> 00:44:00.043
Behold. thou witch!

403
00:44:00.096 --> 00:44:02.508
There she is! Witch!

404
00:44:02.557 --> 00:44:05.966
Witch! Witch!

405
00:44:06.018 --> 00:44:07.633
- Witch!
- Get away!

406
00:44:07.687 --> 00:44:09.223
I'll break your bloody skull!

407
00:44:09.272 --> 00:44:11.638
- Witch!
- That's for Joseph. witch!

408
00:44:37.049 --> 00:44:39.506
Man: Witch! Witch!

409
00:44:46.517 --> 00:44:51.762
Woman. cry no. we won't.

410
00:44:53.024 --> 00:44:56.983
Woman. cry no. we won't.

411
00:44:59.572 --> 00:45:02.359
Cry no. we won't.

412
00:45:02.408 --> 00:45:03.739
Aaah!

413
00:45:08.581 --> 00:45:11.618
Man: Give it to her! Yes!

414
00:45:11.667 --> 00:45:13.908
Hurt her!

415
00:45:38.361 --> 00:45:41.603
Your friend Molly pryor here
only managed two days

416
00:45:41.656 --> 00:45:44.363
before she spilled her guts.

417
00:45:44.408 --> 00:45:47.275
Doesn't have to be this way.

418
00:45:47.328 --> 00:45:50.320
I could still help you.
if you'd let me.

419
00:45:50.373 --> 00:45:52.705
Did you help Molly. too?

420
00:45:54.335 --> 00:45:56.075
Or was she not your type?

421
00:45:56.128 --> 00:45:58.961
I suspected I was going to
have trouble with you.

422
00:45:59.006 --> 00:46:01.122
so I've sent for help
from some more skilled

423
00:46:01.175 --> 00:46:02.915
in the art of persuasion.

424
00:46:02.969 --> 00:46:07.804
the witch finder John moorcroft.

425
00:46:07.848 --> 00:46:11.841
So why not spare yourself
the pain. confess.

426
00:46:11.894 --> 00:46:15.102
Your conscience will be clear.

427
00:46:15.147 --> 00:46:18.310
My conscience is already clear.

428
00:46:18.359 --> 00:46:20.441
Where is my daughter?
What have you done with her?

429
00:46:20.486 --> 00:46:22.943
I haven't done anything
with her.

430
00:46:22.989 --> 00:46:24.900
You think I'd harm
an innocent child?

431
00:46:24.949 --> 00:46:26.485
What kind of man
do you take me for?

432
00:46:26.534 --> 00:46:29.822
I take you for a fool
and a coward.

433
00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:32.532
You have an insolent
tongue. witch.

434
00:46:32.581 --> 00:46:34.537
You're lucky that
I'm feeling charitable today.

435
00:46:34.583 --> 00:46:37.199
Otherwise. I take great pleasure
in cutting it out.

436
00:46:37.253 --> 00:46:41.667
But I warn you.
judgment is coming.

437
00:46:41.716 --> 00:46:44.674
And he won't be so forgiving.

438
00:46:44.719 --> 00:46:47.711
Let him come.

439
00:47:22.089 --> 00:47:24.626
God bless all here.
Welcome. sir.

440
00:47:24.675 --> 00:47:27.382
Care for a drink?

441
00:47:27.428 --> 00:47:30.386
My companion and I have been
on the road since dawn

442
00:47:30.431 --> 00:47:32.638
we require food. libation.

443
00:47:32.683 --> 00:47:34.344
Take a seat.
I'l have the food sent over.

444
00:47:34.393 --> 00:47:36.725
Thank you.

445
00:47:36.771 --> 00:47:40.935
Moorcroft. is it?

446
00:47:40.983 --> 00:47:43.645
- Aye.
- That's him. all right.

447
00:47:43.694 --> 00:47:46.436
George moorcroft.

448
00:47:46.489 --> 00:47:47.945
Butcher and bastard.

449
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:51.778
Hey. Watkins. you're drunk.
Leave the man be.

450
00:47:51.827 --> 00:47:55.194
You have me
at a disadvantage. sir.

451
00:47:55.247 --> 00:47:57.613
You appear to know me.
but I must confess.

452
00:47:57.666 --> 00:48:00.499
I'm at a total loss.

453
00:48:00.544 --> 00:48:03.957
No. I don't suppose
you do remember me.

454
00:48:04.006 --> 00:48:07.169
Just another grieving husband
amongst the countless

455
00:48:07.218 --> 00:48:08.799
that you've left behind.

456
00:48:08.844 --> 00:48:12.086
Sir. your wife was a witch then?

457
00:48:12.139 --> 00:48:14.721
My wife was no witch.

458
00:48:14.767 --> 00:48:16.223
Mistakes are made.

459
00:48:16.268 --> 00:48:18.179
Mistake? Is that what it was?

460
00:48:18.229 --> 00:48:19.344
If that helps.

461
00:48:19.397 --> 00:48:21.763
The only thing that'll help me

462
00:48:21.816 --> 00:48:22.976
is seeing you dead.

463
00:48:23.025 --> 00:48:24.686
Watkins. don't!

464
00:48:24.735 --> 00:48:26.646
There's no need for bloodshed.

465
00:48:29.782 --> 00:48:31.943
What in the name of god
happened to you?

466
00:48:31.992 --> 00:48:34.574
Ursula: The judge showed me
the path to truth.

467
00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:37.657
Open your heart.
and he will show you. too.

468
00:48:37.706 --> 00:48:40.322
Get the hell out of my way.

469
00:48:40.376 --> 00:48:41.912
Aah!

470
00:48:53.639 --> 00:48:56.927
For some. the truth
is beyond them.

471
00:48:58.811 --> 00:49:01.223
Come. Ursula.

472
00:49:01.272 --> 00:49:04.184
I fear we've outstayed
our welcome.

473
00:49:14.869 --> 00:49:17.451
You can be as selfless
as you like.

474
00:49:17.496 --> 00:49:20.238
You can't win.

475
00:49:20.291 --> 00:49:22.407
We're innocent.

476
00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:24.826
I don't care.

477
00:49:36.098 --> 00:49:37.759
That man's got the sickness.

478
00:49:37.808 --> 00:49:39.799
Is that right?

479
00:49:39.852 --> 00:49:43.515
You're not just a pretty face.
are you then?

480
00:49:43.564 --> 00:49:45.771
Come on. then.

481
00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:48.057
Whew.

482
00:49:50.988 --> 00:49:54.651
The sickness. eh?

483
00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:57.612
All the more reason to
keep him locked up.

484
00:50:18.432 --> 00:50:21.595
Fresh water straight
from the river.

485
00:50:21.644 --> 00:50:23.225
For all it's worth.

486
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:25.556
I thought you were forbidden
to speak to me.

487
00:50:25.606 --> 00:50:29.440
Well. they'll punish me I do.
You'll curse me if I don't.

488
00:50:31.278 --> 00:50:33.360
You know why I'm really here.

489
00:50:35.032 --> 00:50:36.897
All I ask is news
of my daughter.

490
00:50:36.951 --> 00:50:38.407
I don't know anything.

491
00:50:38.452 --> 00:50:41.319
Ask around. Anything
you can find out. please.

492
00:50:41.372 --> 00:50:43.408
Sorry. I have to go.

493
00:50:58.889 --> 00:51:03.303
And I looked.
beheld a pale horse.

494
00:51:07.189 --> 00:51:11.853
His name who sat
on him was death.

495
00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:15.356
Hell followed with him.

496
00:51:16.365 --> 00:51:20.574
Judge moorcroft. thank you
for your swift response.

497
00:51:20.619 --> 00:51:23.452
We're in need of your expertise
in this matter.

498
00:51:23.497 --> 00:51:24.987
Has my equipment arrived?

499
00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:27.201
It got here just before you did.

500
00:51:27.251 --> 00:51:29.617
- Good. Take me to her.
- So soon?

501
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:33.162
After such a long journey.
would you not prefer to rest?

502
00:51:33.215 --> 00:51:36.082
The devil never rests.

503
00:51:36.135 --> 00:51:38.251
Nor must we.

504
00:51:38.304 --> 00:51:39.794
She has a bed in her cell?

505
00:51:39.847 --> 00:51:42.338
Yes. it's crude.
but it's enough to sleep on.

506
00:51:42.391 --> 00:51:45.133
We must get rid of it.
You're too lenient.

507
00:51:45.185 --> 00:51:48.848
And if she sleeps.
you douse her with ice water.

508
00:51:48.897 --> 00:51:51.559
She's in league with
the dark one.

509
00:51:51.609 --> 00:51:53.600
Never forget that.

510
00:51:55.863 --> 00:52:00.323
Fear not. my child.
Salvation is at hand.

511
00:52:02.411 --> 00:52:04.527
Have food and wine sent to
my room.

512
00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:06.491
I must prepare.

513
00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:09.953
There is god's work to be done.

514
00:52:35.277 --> 00:52:37.268
Joseph.

515
00:52:37.321 --> 00:52:39.482
Joseph: Grace.

516
00:52:40.991 --> 00:52:42.606
Grace.

517
00:52:44.578 --> 00:52:45.943
Joseph.

518
00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:48.320
Joseph?

519
00:53:27.579 --> 00:53:29.115
No!

520
00:53:35.462 --> 00:53:37.703
She won't last long.

521
00:53:37.756 --> 00:53:39.542
I don't know.

522
00:53:39.591 --> 00:53:42.549
There's something about her.
something different.

523
00:53:42.594 --> 00:53:45.210
- Different?
- Yeah.

524
00:53:45.264 --> 00:53:49.473
Well. witch or not.
I'd still do her.

525
00:53:51.145 --> 00:53:53.431
You're a sick bastard. peck.

526
00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:57.439
She'll curse you.
make your balls drop off.

527
00:53:57.484 --> 00:53:59.600
I'd still do her.

528
00:54:12.416 --> 00:54:16.500
Never forget who you are.

529
00:54:16.545 --> 00:54:19.127
Wake up. witch!

530
00:54:24.219 --> 00:54:26.175
It's time.

531
00:54:28.182 --> 00:54:31.970
Moorcroft: Grace haverstock.
1 am confused.

532
00:54:32.019 --> 00:54:35.477
The depositions are unanimous.
and the evidence is clear.

533
00:54:35.522 --> 00:54:38.764
Yet you persist
in claiming your innocence.

534
00:54:38.817 --> 00:54:40.503
Now. you must understand
that you have put me

535
00:54:40.527 --> 00:54:43.815
in a very difficult position.

536
00:54:43.864 --> 00:54:47.482
But when dealing
with the forces of darkness.

537
00:54:47.534 --> 00:54:51.823
I cannot afford to be reckless.

538
00:54:51.872 --> 00:54:58.209
The devil. grace. is deceitful.

539
00:54:58.253 --> 00:55:02.246
and it is my sworn duty
to uncover the truth.

540
00:55:04.968 --> 00:55:07.334
Oh.

541
00:55:07.387 --> 00:55:09.469
You won't be
needing this anymore.

542
00:55:12.768 --> 00:55:17.603
For this is between
you and I now. grace.

543
00:55:18.565 --> 00:55:22.524
It's a battle of wills.
if you like.

544
00:55:22.569 --> 00:55:25.811
and I warn you of this.

545
00:55:25.864 --> 00:55:29.072
My will is greater than yours.

546
00:55:29.117 --> 00:55:31.324
We'll see.

547
00:55:34.289 --> 00:55:37.201
Well. let us begin.

548
00:55:37.251 --> 00:55:39.207
Gentlemen.

549
00:55:46.343 --> 00:55:48.504
Strap her in.

550
00:56:02.985 --> 00:56:07.103
Sister Agatha. you may proceed
with the examination.

551
00:56:50.908 --> 00:56:53.490
We have something.

552
00:56:59.917 --> 00:57:01.578
And there we have it!

553
00:57:01.627 --> 00:57:04.619
Clear as day! The devil's Mark.

554
00:57:06.214 --> 00:57:09.047
Tell me something. my dear.

555
00:57:09.092 --> 00:57:11.378
When you fornicate
with the beast.

556
00:57:11.428 --> 00:57:13.965
does his bite sting?

557
00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:16.675
Come on!

558
00:57:16.725 --> 00:57:18.036
No. I don't want to go
back in there.

559
00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:20.972
You will go where you are
bloody well told.

560
00:57:23.148 --> 00:57:26.060
And cover yourself up.

561
00:57:31.323 --> 00:57:35.032
I brought you extra bread
and cheese.

562
00:57:35.077 --> 00:57:38.069
- Do you duties. boy!
- I've got to go.

563
00:57:38.121 --> 00:57:40.157
Just don't give up.

564
00:57:40.207 --> 00:57:42.994
The judge is begging
for his wine.

565
00:57:43.043 --> 00:57:47.161
- What news from London?
- Oh. London is lost.

566
00:57:47.214 --> 00:57:52.675
Thousands have fled to
the safety of the countryside.

567
00:57:52.719 --> 00:57:55.461
Bodies are piled high
in the narrow streets.

568
00:57:55.514 --> 00:57:59.883
Burial parties struggle to cope.
so the stench of rotting flesh

569
00:57:59.935 --> 00:58:03.974
hangs over the city
like putrid fog.

570
00:58:04.022 --> 00:58:05.637
And the rats...

571
00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:12.478
The rats are everywhere.

572
00:58:12.531 --> 00:58:16.774
It's as if the day of judgment
has finally arrived.

573
00:58:16.827 --> 00:58:19.159
All the more reason we should
seek out and destroy evil

574
00:58:19.204 --> 00:58:20.785
where we find it.
don't you think?

575
00:58:20.831 --> 00:58:22.367
Easier said than done.

576
00:58:22.416 --> 00:58:26.159
Grace may be stubborn.
but she will break.

577
00:58:26.211 --> 00:58:31.376
You'd be surprised.
Such is the power of conviction.

578
00:58:31.425 --> 00:58:34.838
Squire: Well. maybe you're
just not hurting her enough.

579
00:58:34.886 --> 00:58:37.127
you really are a vicious brute.
aren't you?

580
00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:39.887
Coming from you. I'll take
that as a compliment.

581
00:58:39.933 --> 00:58:43.175
I just hope we didn't
bring you here for nothing.

582
00:58:43.228 --> 00:58:45.219
She has the devil inside her.

583
00:58:45.272 --> 00:58:48.810
Any fool can see that.

584
00:58:48.859 --> 00:58:51.441
You will have your confession.
I guarantee it.

585
00:59:24.311 --> 00:59:26.848
Joseph.

586
00:59:31.526 --> 00:59:35.018
Joseph: There. my love.

587
00:59:35.072 --> 00:59:37.188
I'm with you.

588
00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:39.856
Oh. I want to see you.

589
00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:41.696
Joseph: Open your eyes.

590
01:00:10.857 --> 01:00:12.848
Oh.

591
01:00:14.861 --> 01:00:17.694
A sign of despair.

592
01:00:22.369 --> 01:00:25.532
I care not for your flesh.

593
01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:28.196
I just want your soul.

594
01:00:33.505 --> 01:00:37.999
What did I tell you?
No sleeping!

595
01:00:45.517 --> 01:00:47.428
They usually give up by now.

596
01:00:47.477 --> 01:00:49.718
Hm.

597
01:00:59.614 --> 01:01:02.105
You playing. or what?

598
01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:05.242
What if she's innocent
like she says?

599
01:01:05.287 --> 01:01:08.700
Does she go to hell? Or do we?

600
01:01:08.748 --> 01:01:11.581
Look around you. mate.

601
01:01:11.626 --> 01:01:13.787
We're already here.

602
01:01:13.837 --> 01:01:16.579
Roll.

603
01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:19.373
Shit!

604
01:01:19.426 --> 01:01:21.587
What's with all these bloody
rats all of a sudden?

605
01:01:21.636 --> 01:01:24.252
Have you seen any cats lately?

606
01:01:24.306 --> 01:01:26.217
Roll.

607
01:01:41.948 --> 01:01:44.690
Grace. grace!

608
01:01:44.743 --> 01:01:47.405
I have news.

609
01:01:47.454 --> 01:01:48.864
Tell me. please.

610
01:01:48.914 --> 01:01:50.558
Your daughter is in
the keeping of the squire

611
01:01:50.582 --> 01:01:52.072
in the south tower.

612
01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:53.925
A nurse maid is called
to attend to her needs.

613
01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.575
She's safe. She's not safe.

614
01:01:55.629 --> 01:01:57.165
Not with him.

615
01:01:57.214 --> 01:01:59.296
That's all I know.

616
01:01:59.341 --> 01:02:02.424
- Thank you.
- Make sure you eat.

617
01:02:19.277 --> 01:02:21.563
I feel it is time
that we discussed the recent

618
01:02:21.613 --> 01:02:24.400
passing of your husband. Joseph.

619
01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:30.285
I hear from the squire that
he succumbed to the sickness.

620
01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:32.366
And given the circumstance.
I felt the need

621
01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:36.078
for absolute certainty.

622
01:02:36.127 --> 01:02:39.415
And so I had his body exhumed.

623
01:02:39.464 --> 01:02:40.829
And although his death

624
01:02:40.882 --> 01:02:43.919
by pestilence
was a foregone conclusion.

625
01:02:43.969 --> 01:02:48.679
you could only imagine
how perplexed I was to find...

626
01:02:51.184 --> 01:02:52.344
This...

627
01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:57.137
Hanging around his
stretched neck.

628
01:02:57.190 --> 01:03:00.899
Now. I did not know
your husband. grace.

629
01:03:00.944 --> 01:03:03.401
but by all accounts.
I hear that he was a good man.

630
01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:07.735
that he was a kind man.
that he was a godly man.

631
01:03:08.952 --> 01:03:13.366
Which makes me wonder.
why would such a man commit

632
01:03:13.415 --> 01:03:16.703
the mortal crime
of taking his own life

633
01:03:16.751 --> 01:03:19.288
unless it was the witch
he was fool enough

634
01:03:19.337 --> 01:03:21.953
to marry or the devil himself?

635
01:03:25.093 --> 01:03:28.711
Admit it. grace. please.

636
01:03:29.431 --> 01:03:33.219
Admit it. that you...
That you cursed him

637
01:03:33.268 --> 01:03:36.556
and you sent an innocent man
to the bowels of hell!

638
01:03:39.524 --> 01:03:41.640
Take her down.

639
01:03:49.409 --> 01:03:54.073
Repent your sins.
redeem your soul.

640
01:03:54.122 --> 01:03:57.285
Free yourself.

641
01:04:04.132 --> 01:04:06.464
Begin.

642
01:05:01.398 --> 01:05:03.730
Take her away.

643
01:05:04.192 --> 01:05:09.186
You. boy! Give me a hand.

644
01:05:26.798 --> 01:05:29.164
For the love of god.
why did you do this?

645
01:05:29.217 --> 01:05:31.003
Just give them what they want.

646
01:05:31.052 --> 01:05:32.883
I won't.

647
01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:35.887
If you continue like this.
they're going to kill you.

648
01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:38.639
They're going to kill me anyway.

649
01:05:39.185 --> 01:05:42.302
I do not fight for my life.

650
01:05:44.023 --> 01:05:48.141
Please do not abandon hope.

651
01:05:51.573 --> 01:05:53.734
I think hope has abandoned me.

652
01:06:04.335 --> 01:06:07.827
There's only way
out of this now.

653
01:06:18.516 --> 01:06:23.601
Something troubles you. Ursula.

654
01:06:23.646 --> 01:06:26.683
She has courage.
don't you think?

655
01:06:26.733 --> 01:06:30.521
It is but a mask. that is all.

656
01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:32.936
I know.

657
01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:36.026
Forgive me.

658
01:06:36.075 --> 01:06:40.660
Never doubt the virtue
of our task.

659
01:06:40.705 --> 01:06:44.163
Never mind how difficult
or painful it may be.

660
01:06:44.209 --> 01:06:48.077
Always remember what she is.

661
01:06:54.636 --> 01:06:57.969
The darkness an allure to it.

662
01:06:58.014 --> 01:07:00.175
I understand this.

663
01:07:01.601 --> 01:07:04.513
And that is why our struggle
is so much harder

664
01:07:04.562 --> 01:07:09.431
and the lord's soldiers
must be so much stronger.

665
01:07:09.484 --> 01:07:12.476
I remember the day
the rain came.

666
01:07:15.198 --> 01:07:19.066
Deluge direct from heaven above.

667
01:07:20.662 --> 01:07:25.702
And I pulled you from the ashes.
purged of evil.

668
01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:31.874
And in your heart. a new resolve
to enlighten those

669
01:07:31.923 --> 01:07:34.505
that had strayed into
the darkness.

670
01:07:37.178 --> 01:07:40.966
That is true courage. Ursula.

671
01:07:41.015 --> 01:07:43.677
That is strength.

672
01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:48.390
And that is why I need you
by my side.

673
01:07:50.316 --> 01:07:58.316
You... are my anchor
in the eternal storm.

674
01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:03.363
I should have held my tongue.

675
01:08:03.413 --> 01:08:08.453
On the contrary. I think it is
time that you spoke with her.

676
01:08:13.381 --> 01:08:14.996
Stay awake.

677
01:08:15.049 --> 01:08:19.383
For you do not know on what day
your lord is coming.

678
01:08:50.835 --> 01:08:52.871
Grace.

679
01:08:53.838 --> 01:08:55.248
No.

680
01:08:56.132 --> 01:08:57.793
It's not you.

681
01:08:59.469 --> 01:09:01.130
Don't you know your own husband?

682
01:09:01.179 --> 01:09:03.420
My love.

683
01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:06.593
I know the devil has many faces.

684
01:09:06.643 --> 01:09:11.387
Oh. grace. please.

685
01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:14.522
You're just a dream.

686
01:09:14.567 --> 01:09:18.401
But you're awake.

687
01:09:18.446 --> 01:09:20.732
Joseph.

688
01:09:20.782 --> 01:09:21.897
Joseph!

689
01:09:21.949 --> 01:09:23.814
I will not be denied!

690
01:09:53.606 --> 01:09:55.722
Mama.

691
01:09:55.775 --> 01:09:59.142
I'm sorry.

692
01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:03.529
I blamed you and I scolded you.

693
01:10:03.574 --> 01:10:07.362
I didn't understand.

694
01:10:07.412 --> 01:10:11.371
I did not understand.

695
01:10:11.416 --> 01:10:13.372
Ursula: Fear not. child.

696
01:10:13.418 --> 01:10:15.784
The lord forgives.

697
01:10:19.048 --> 01:10:21.255
How did you get in here?
What do you want?

698
01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:23.416
I mean you no harm.

699
01:10:23.469 --> 01:10:25.881
Here. eat.

700
01:10:31.227 --> 01:10:36.438
Tell me. what does
he say to you?

701
01:10:36.482 --> 01:10:38.018
Who?

702
01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:42.276
Ursula: The devil. when he comes
to you in the night.

703
01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:46.697
- I don't know...
- It's okay.

704
01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:48.529
You can tell me.

705
01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:51.365
I myself spoke with
him frequently.

706
01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:55.744
I know how it feels.

707
01:10:55.793 --> 01:10:57.749
Leave me alone.

708
01:10:57.795 --> 01:10:59.331
Get out.

709
01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:00.995
Ursula: I. too. succumbed
to temptation.

710
01:11:01.048 --> 01:11:04.540
made unholy union
with the devil.

711
01:11:04.594 --> 01:11:09.258
But judge moorcroft showed me
the path to truth.

712
01:11:09.307 --> 01:11:11.093
You mean he tortured you.

713
01:11:11.142 --> 01:11:13.258
Enlightened me.

714
01:11:15.897 --> 01:11:19.515
I was in denial at first.

715
01:11:19.567 --> 01:11:22.934
But only through
the purification of pain

716
01:11:22.987 --> 01:11:26.275
did I cleanse my soul.

717
01:11:26.324 --> 01:11:29.236
You may hold out for a day.

718
01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:30.821
Maybe two.

719
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:35.034
But in the end.
you will beg for redemption.

720
01:11:35.082 --> 01:11:37.198
Let me help you.

721
01:11:37.251 --> 01:11:41.039
We can end
this suffering together.

722
01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:43.587
Mama.

723
01:11:45.426 --> 01:11:50.386
You gave your life for me.

724
01:11:50.431 --> 01:11:52.387
Should I give them
what they want?

725
01:11:52.433 --> 01:11:55.596
You've fought long enough.

726
01:11:55.645 --> 01:11:59.183
You can let go now.

727
01:11:59.232 --> 01:12:01.769
Free yourself.

728
01:12:06.948 --> 01:12:11.692
- Joseph.
- Free yourself. my love.

729
01:12:13.287 --> 01:12:16.950
Ursula: Follow the path
to truth. grace.

730
01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:22.995
If you won't do it for yourself.
then do it for your daughter.

731
01:12:26.884 --> 01:12:32.174
Now I see the truth of it.

732
01:12:32.223 --> 01:12:35.010
Tell me. how many others
have you sent the scaffold

733
01:12:35.059 --> 01:12:36.515
or burn to death?

734
01:12:36.561 --> 01:12:38.121
Did you convince them
that they were witches

735
01:12:38.145 --> 01:12:40.682
just as your own accusers
convinced you?

736
01:12:40.731 --> 01:12:47.148
When you're told something often
enough. you start to believe it.

737
01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:52.361
What you're unwilling
or unable to accept

738
01:12:52.410 --> 01:12:56.653
is you were no more the witch
then than I am now.

739
01:12:56.706 --> 01:13:00.494
So why don't we take your
so-called truth and get out?

740
01:13:00.543 --> 01:13:03.034
Guard.

741
01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:11.300
You should heed my words.

742
01:13:11.345 --> 01:13:13.927
The fate of your soul
depends upon it.

743
01:13:13.973 --> 01:13:16.555
Fate of my soul is a matter
between myself and god

744
01:13:16.601 --> 01:13:18.182
and no other.

745
01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:44.575
Make sure you eat.

746
01:13:59.143 --> 01:14:01.555
"Abby's safe. Have her.

747
01:14:01.604 --> 01:14:04.596
Get down here. you bloody...

748
01:14:04.649 --> 01:14:07.061
- Come on you!
- It's the gypsy girl.

749
01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:08.474
Wonder what she did.

750
01:14:08.527 --> 01:14:11.519
Doesn't matter.

751
01:14:11.572 --> 01:14:14.939
Nobody's safe.

752
01:14:14.992 --> 01:14:18.325
Grant me strength on this day.
oh. lord.

753
01:14:18.371 --> 01:14:21.454
Shield me in your might.

754
01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:28.294
Dress me in your armor.

755
01:14:30.091 --> 01:14:35.302
That I made deflect
the evil schemes of the devil.

756
01:14:41.143 --> 01:14:44.476
And what torturous delights
have we in store today?

757
01:14:44.522 --> 01:14:47.389
I am god's instrument. sir.

758
01:14:47.441 --> 01:14:50.274
This is my duty.
I take no pleasure in it.

759
01:14:51.237 --> 01:14:53.148
Your loss.

760
01:14:55.199 --> 01:14:56.905
Bring forth the accused!

761
01:14:56.951 --> 01:15:00.614
Man: Make way! Make way!

762
01:15:00.663 --> 01:15:02.824
Witch! Witch!

763
01:15:02.873 --> 01:15:04.738
Witch! Witch! Witch! Witch!

764
01:15:07.628 --> 01:15:11.291
My god have mercy.

765
01:15:24.061 --> 01:15:26.427
Good people. before you
stands grace haverstock.

766
01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:28.345
Now. you all know
why she's here.

767
01:15:28.399 --> 01:15:31.812
The evidence is damning
and taken from your own

768
01:15:31.861 --> 01:15:35.274
sworn statements.
eyewitness accounts proving

769
01:15:35.322 --> 01:15:36.983
her association with
Molly pryor.

770
01:15:37.033 --> 01:15:40.025
a convicted witch.
and worse still.

771
01:15:40.077 --> 01:15:45.743
wanton fornication
with a dark one. as evidenced...

772
01:15:45.791 --> 01:15:48.157
By the witch's Mark
upon her body.

773
01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:51.543
Now. such lurid testimony
should be enough to condemn her.

774
01:15:51.589 --> 01:15:53.875
but we have also heard

775
01:15:53.924 --> 01:15:56.586
how the pestilence did not
take root within her body

776
01:15:56.635 --> 01:15:59.672
or that of her infant child.

777
01:15:59.722 --> 01:16:05.092
And so I ask you
what more proof is needed?

778
01:16:05.144 --> 01:16:07.180
Witch. witch.

779
01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:09.936
For Pete's sake. stop this!

780
01:16:09.982 --> 01:16:11.518
Tell your wife to
mind her tongue.

781
01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:12.932
or she'll end up there next.

782
01:16:12.985 --> 01:16:14.976
Just be quiet.

783
01:16:15.029 --> 01:16:16.394
I will not.

784
01:16:16.447 --> 01:16:19.655
- Then you'll come with me.
- Get her out.

785
01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:30.075
I ask you again.
in the eyes of god.

786
01:16:30.127 --> 01:16:32.789
do you confess?

787
01:16:38.302 --> 01:16:40.258
Ursula.

788
01:16:58.030 --> 01:17:02.899
Grace. do you know what this is?

789
01:17:02.952 --> 01:17:07.195
Its design is simple.
but most effective.

790
01:17:07.248 --> 01:17:13.335
It has but one purpose...
To inflict excruciating pain.

791
01:17:13.379 --> 01:17:17.292
To have the desired result.
it must be inserted fully.

792
01:17:17.341 --> 01:17:21.209
And then the handle
must be turned thus.

793
01:17:21.262 --> 01:17:26.848
Again... and again.

794
01:17:26.892 --> 01:17:33.354
And again until the pain
is unendurable.

795
01:17:33.399 --> 01:17:36.983
Grace. do not make me do this.

796
01:17:37.027 --> 01:17:38.483
Do not make me do this.

797
01:17:38.529 --> 01:17:41.692
Suffer no more!

798
01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:43.526
Confess.

799
01:17:43.576 --> 01:17:45.783
Confess!

800
01:17:48.539 --> 01:17:54.330
You can tear my flesh
and break my bones.

801
01:17:54.378 --> 01:17:58.212
but I will not
bear false witness before you

802
01:17:58.257 --> 01:18:00.122
or anyone else.

803
01:18:00.176 --> 01:18:03.885
I know the truth.

804
01:18:03.929 --> 01:18:09.970
And I will endure all of your
torments to protect it.

805
01:18:10.019 --> 01:18:13.762
For my will...

806
01:18:13.814 --> 01:18:16.806
Is greater than yours.

807
01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:24.355
Take her down.

808
01:18:38.589 --> 01:18:41.797
Courage now. my dear Ursula.

809
01:18:41.842 --> 01:18:44.254
It is god's work we do here.

810
01:18:44.303 --> 01:18:48.888
Let him be your strength.

811
01:19:00.194 --> 01:19:06.656
Grace. I beg of you. confess.

812
01:19:08.577 --> 01:19:12.320
This is your last chance.
Confess.

813
01:19:58.585 --> 01:20:01.668
God as my witness. I have done
everything in my power

814
01:20:01.714 --> 01:20:06.174
to purge your soul of evil.
but to no avail.

815
01:20:06.719 --> 01:20:09.927
Therefore. I sentence you
to death for the grievous crime

816
01:20:09.972 --> 01:20:11.428
of malfeasance.

817
01:20:11.473 --> 01:20:14.180
Wait. wait. wait.
You promised me a confession.

818
01:20:14.226 --> 01:20:16.683
A confession is implicit.

819
01:20:16.729 --> 01:20:18.139
Who else could withstand
such pain

820
01:20:18.188 --> 01:20:19.428
other than a witch?

821
01:20:19.481 --> 01:20:21.688
Thou shall not suffer a witch
to live.

822
01:20:21.734 --> 01:20:23.725
Charlatan! The pair of you!

823
01:20:23.777 --> 01:20:27.565
She is in league with the devil.
and she will burn for it.

824
01:20:27.614 --> 01:20:29.400
As will her child.

825
01:20:29.450 --> 01:20:31.361
- No.
- The bloodline must be severed.

826
01:20:31.410 --> 01:20:33.571
No! No!

827
01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:35.827
The sentence of
this court is final.

828
01:20:35.873 --> 01:20:37.409
Not my baby! No!

829
01:20:37.458 --> 01:20:39.449
God have mercy on your souls.

830
01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:41.742
No!

831
01:20:43.672 --> 01:20:45.537
What's the matter?
Nothing to say now?

832
01:20:45.591 --> 01:20:48.048
- Nothing to say to you.
- Oh. suit yourself.

833
01:20:48.093 --> 01:20:50.584
Better that way. Don't know
what you're so upset about.

834
01:20:50.637 --> 01:20:52.628
She lied to us.
She had it coming.

835
01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:55.844
Why did I marry such
an ignorant fool?

836
01:20:55.893 --> 01:20:57.633
What did you say?

837
01:20:57.686 --> 01:20:59.927
- You heard me.
- Say it again.

838
01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:01.766
Go on.

839
01:21:01.815 --> 01:21:03.806
Say it to my face.

840
01:21:03.859 --> 01:21:07.226
I won't be silenced
by a coward like you.

841
01:21:07.279 --> 01:21:08.940
To hell with you.

842
01:21:08.989 --> 01:21:12.402
If that's how you feel.
you can bloody well walk home.

843
01:21:16.789 --> 01:21:20.532
Is that it? Is that all you got?

844
01:21:20.584 --> 01:21:24.122
Didn't you learn anything
from what you saw today?

845
01:21:24.171 --> 01:21:26.753
I'm not taking
your shit anymore!

846
01:21:26.799 --> 01:21:29.962
Oh. is that all you got. eh?

847
01:21:30.010 --> 01:21:32.501
It's time I taught you a lesson
you're not going to forget

848
01:21:32.554 --> 01:21:34.795
in such a hurry.

849
01:21:54.076 --> 01:22:01.619
Aaah!

850
01:22:01.667 --> 01:22:03.077
What are you gonna
do with that. eh?

851
01:22:03.127 --> 01:22:05.413
Give me a bloody tooth ache?

852
01:22:26.483 --> 01:22:31.978
Well. he smells pretty bad.
so it looks like it was

853
01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:34.612
the sickness that killed him.

854
01:22:34.658 --> 01:22:36.740
So the witch was right then?

855
01:22:40.330 --> 01:22:42.537
Yeah.

856
01:22:51.925 --> 01:22:53.836
I got your message.

857
01:22:53.886 --> 01:22:57.299
But I need more than hope now.

858
01:22:57.347 --> 01:23:00.589
Tell me what will they do
with old man's body?

859
01:23:00.642 --> 01:23:03.384
Dump it in the pit come morning.
I expect.

860
01:23:03.437 --> 01:23:05.894
Why?

861
01:23:05.939 --> 01:23:11.275
I was hoping to escape
with Abby tonight.

862
01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:15.063
Will you help me?

863
01:23:15.115 --> 01:23:16.821
Tell me what to do.

864
01:23:19.328 --> 01:23:26.416
Enter.

865
01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:28.325
The witch wants to
speak with you.

866
01:23:28.378 --> 01:23:32.246
She says she's got something
important to tell you.

867
01:23:32.299 --> 01:23:35.086
Then we better hear
what she has to say.

868
01:23:35.135 --> 01:23:37.000
Bring her up.

869
01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:42.889
Clean yourself up. Put that on.

870
01:23:42.935 --> 01:23:46.223
You ought to look respectable
for the judge.

871
01:23:46.271 --> 01:23:48.933
We'll watch.

872
01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:58.731
What the bloody hell
do you think you're going

873
01:23:58.784 --> 01:24:00.194
to do with that thing?

874
01:24:00.244 --> 01:24:02.610
You can't be too careful
with the likes of her.

875
01:24:02.663 --> 01:24:04.199
Yeah. well. just be careful

876
01:24:04.248 --> 01:24:06.364
and don't blow me
to smithereens with it.

877
01:24:06.416 --> 01:24:10.705
Go with god. my child.
His shadow is upon you.

878
01:24:26.395 --> 01:24:28.386
Forgive me.

879
01:24:52.087 --> 01:24:54.419
Moorcroft: Leave us.

880
01:24:59.261 --> 01:25:03.345
I believe there's something
you wish to tell me. grace.

881
01:25:03.390 --> 01:25:06.257
I'll give you what you want.

882
01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:08.175
On one condition.

883
01:25:11.398 --> 01:25:13.389
Abby.

884
01:25:13.442 --> 01:25:16.684
She really is the most beautiful
child. is she not?

885
01:25:16.737 --> 01:25:19.945
Please give her to me.

886
01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:22.026
All in good time. my dear.

887
01:25:34.129 --> 01:25:35.585
What are you doing here. boy?

888
01:25:35.631 --> 01:25:38.088
Just pouring
the judge's wine. sir.

889
01:25:38.133 --> 01:25:40.920
Better get on with it then.

890
01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:44.553
Moorcroft: So innocent. so pure.

891
01:25:47.017 --> 01:25:51.852
I suppose all witches start
this way before evil takes root.

892
01:25:51.897 --> 01:25:54.104
Being a witch yourself.

893
01:25:54.149 --> 01:25:57.983
how do you foresee the future
of your daughter Abigail?

894
01:25:58.028 --> 01:26:00.269
She dies tomorrow.

895
01:26:00.322 --> 01:26:03.155
At my side. by your hand.

896
01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:05.361
Oh.

897
01:26:05.410 --> 01:26:09.870
So you've come to bargain
for her life. have you?

898
01:26:09.915 --> 01:26:14.454
Her life is all I ask.

899
01:26:14.503 --> 01:26:16.869
If you still want
your confession.

900
01:26:18.298 --> 01:26:20.755
Very well.

901
01:26:21.927 --> 01:26:25.340
Your child shall live.

902
01:26:25.389 --> 01:26:28.347
But I have
a condition of my own.

903
01:26:28.392 --> 01:26:31.759
That she be raised by Ursula
as a servant of god.

904
01:26:33.689 --> 01:26:37.102
Her salvation demands
a strong hand.

905
01:26:37.150 --> 01:26:40.358
So she doesn't follow
in her mother's footsteps.

906
01:26:42.197 --> 01:26:47.191
Now. I feel it is time that
you should say goodbye.

907
01:26:51.206 --> 01:26:54.664
Never forget that I love you.

908
01:27:14.271 --> 01:27:16.603
Ursula: It's time.

909
01:27:29.369 --> 01:27:34.363
I love you. Abby. I love you!

910
01:27:41.089 --> 01:27:43.751
There. there. my sweet child.

911
01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:45.415
Mother's here.

912
01:27:45.469 --> 01:27:47.585
Don't cry.

913
01:28:02.944 --> 01:28:06.528
It's just the two
of us now. grace.

914
01:28:06.573 --> 01:28:08.985
No more secrets.

915
01:28:09.034 --> 01:28:11.275
No more lies.

916
01:28:11.328 --> 01:28:13.785
Take a seat.

917
01:28:18.919 --> 01:28:24.630
I feel it is time that we raised
a cup to honor our deal.

918
01:28:34.434 --> 01:28:36.550
I must decline.

919
01:28:36.603 --> 01:28:39.015
I never hand the stomach for it.

920
01:28:39.064 --> 01:28:41.555
Well. I shan't drink alone.

921
01:28:47.239 --> 01:28:49.821
Very well.

922
01:28:50.534 --> 01:28:52.775
What difference does
it make now anyway.

923
01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:56.911
Good point.

924
01:29:00.710 --> 01:29:07.377
You know. I can feel the hatred
burning inside of you. grace.

925
01:29:07.425 --> 01:29:10.838
Any reasonable person would
just let go.

926
01:29:10.887 --> 01:29:14.880
so why don't you let go. grace?

927
01:29:19.437 --> 01:29:21.928
Maybe you'll take
courage in this.

928
01:29:21.982 --> 01:29:23.768
Although I fear
it may be too late for you

929
01:29:23.817 --> 01:29:27.184
to acquire a taste for it.

930
01:29:27.237 --> 01:29:29.273
To courage then.

931
01:29:29.322 --> 01:29:31.358
To courage.

932
01:29:45.088 --> 01:29:49.502
Now. what is it
you want to tell me?

933
01:29:49.551 --> 01:29:52.588
I must unburden myself.

934
01:29:52.637 --> 01:29:55.720
Then please free yourself.

935
01:29:55.765 --> 01:29:57.801
Judge moorcroft...

936
01:29:59.811 --> 01:30:04.100
I wish to confess here and now
before the eyes of god.

937
01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:07.107
that I am...

938
01:30:07.152 --> 01:30:09.143
No witch.

939
01:30:14.242 --> 01:30:16.699
Aaah!

940
01:30:16.745 --> 01:30:18.326
What is this?

941
01:30:18.371 --> 01:30:21.955
A reckoning. judge.
You don't remember me. do you?

942
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.740
And why would I remember you?

943
01:30:23.793 --> 01:30:25.909
I'm the daughter
of Jane hawthorne.

944
01:30:25.962 --> 01:30:27.793
You burnt her alive
when I was 7 years old.

945
01:30:27.839 --> 01:30:30.546
You made me watch.

946
01:30:30.592 --> 01:30:32.799
I'm not surprised
you don't remember.

947
01:30:32.844 --> 01:30:37.383
Just one more innocent woman
you've murdered along the way.

948
01:30:37.432 --> 01:30:41.971
You know. for years. I thought
you were the devil himself.

949
01:30:42.020 --> 01:30:44.386
But now I see it.

950
01:30:44.439 --> 01:30:47.101
You're just an ordinary man.

951
01:30:51.655 --> 01:30:56.149
Wait a moment.
What's your hurry?

952
01:30:56.201 --> 01:30:59.910
I see no reason why we couldn't
become better acquainted.

953
01:30:59.955 --> 01:31:02.617
Acquaint yourself with this.

954
01:31:02.666 --> 01:31:05.032
My mistake.

955
01:31:05.085 --> 01:31:08.748
Not sure I could bear
to look at you anyway.

956
01:31:14.511 --> 01:31:19.005
If it's repentance you're after.
you will receive none.

957
01:31:19.057 --> 01:31:21.389
I will continue doing
what I do as long as evil

958
01:31:21.434 --> 01:31:26.019
stalks this earth. and yes.
yes. I do remember your mother.

959
01:31:26.064 --> 01:31:28.225
I remember the stench of her
as she burned.

960
01:31:28.274 --> 01:31:29.684
Grace: She was innocent.

961
01:31:29.734 --> 01:31:31.474
She gave her life to protect
her daughter.

962
01:31:31.528 --> 01:31:34.065
Well. we each have our part
to play. don't we?

963
01:31:34.114 --> 01:31:36.105
That's right.
And your part is done.

964
01:31:36.157 --> 01:31:38.239
Now it's time to play dead.

965
01:31:38.284 --> 01:31:40.946
- What?
- The wine. you fool.

966
01:31:40.996 --> 01:31:44.079
It's laced with pestilence.

967
01:31:45.625 --> 01:31:47.240
But you drunk it. too.

968
01:31:47.293 --> 01:31:49.750
I die tomorrow.

969
01:31:49.796 --> 01:31:52.833
I just wanted you to know
from the woman

970
01:31:52.882 --> 01:31:56.795
who killed you.
an ordinary woman.

971
01:32:31.004 --> 01:32:32.665
Ursula!

972
01:32:32.714 --> 01:32:34.921
Save your breath.

973
01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:40.252
It's just us now.

974
01:32:40.305 --> 01:32:45.641
No more secrets. no more lies.

975
01:32:48.605 --> 01:32:51.187
You won't be needing this.

976
01:33:49.457 --> 01:33:51.743
Don't make a sound.

977
01:33:51.793 --> 01:33:55.035
Leave now.

978
01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:22.816
Ursula!

979
01:34:22.866 --> 01:34:24.527
Not a word.

980
01:34:38.965 --> 01:34:43.379
What the hell are you
doing here. boy?

981
01:36:37.041 --> 01:36:39.202
Murdering witch!

982
01:36:45.091 --> 01:36:46.922
Edwin. where's Abby?

983
01:36:46.968 --> 01:36:48.754
I have her. Let's go.

984
01:36:54.892 --> 01:36:57.304
Free yourself.

985
01:37:08.865 --> 01:37:10.901
Grace. come on. We have to
go out through here.

986
01:37:10.950 --> 01:37:13.316
Wait.

987
01:37:29.135 --> 01:37:31.922
Guards! Sound the alarm.

988
01:37:44.484 --> 01:37:47.226
Grace. what's wrong?

989
01:37:47.862 --> 01:37:49.523
I can't go with you.

990
01:37:49.572 --> 01:37:52.655
What you're talking about?

991
01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:54.782
Wait. no!

992
01:37:57.663 --> 01:37:59.073
What have you done?!

993
01:37:59.123 --> 01:38:01.660
What needed to be done
to protect you both.

994
01:38:01.709 --> 01:38:03.040
I don't understand.

995
01:38:03.086 --> 01:38:05.372
I drunk the wine.

996
01:38:05.421 --> 01:38:08.584
I can't her life or yours.
I'm sorry.

997
01:38:08.633 --> 01:38:11.545
But the wine wasn't poisoned.

998
01:38:11.594 --> 01:38:13.175
What? What?

999
01:38:13.221 --> 01:38:15.257
I tried to tell you.

1000
01:38:15.306 --> 01:38:17.012
Ah.

1001
01:38:19.519 --> 01:38:21.976
What's good enough for him

1002
01:38:22.021 --> 01:38:24.512
is good enough for me.

1003
01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:33.362
No. No!

1004
01:38:33.408 --> 01:38:35.569
Help me!

1005
01:38:35.618 --> 01:38:38.325
Man: Oy! You!

1006
01:38:39.705 --> 01:38:42.287
Man: What do you
think you're doing?

1007
01:38:42.333 --> 01:38:44.073
Hey.

1008
01:38:44.127 --> 01:38:45.663
Find Kate Tobias.

1009
01:38:45.711 --> 01:38:48.202
Tell her what happened.
She'll know what to do.

1010
01:38:48.256 --> 01:38:50.668
I won't leave you.

1011
01:38:51.217 --> 01:38:53.503
You must go.

1012
01:38:54.137 --> 01:38:57.550
You're a good man. Edwin.

1013
01:39:05.982 --> 01:39:10.316
Man: Ah. it's the witch.
Get her!

1014
01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:42.761
Come on.

1015
01:39:46.772 --> 01:39:48.387
Witch!

1016
01:39:57.658 --> 01:39:59.774
No! Save us!

1017
01:39:59.827 --> 01:40:00.942
Please!

1018
01:40:00.995 --> 01:40:02.485
Keys!

1019
01:40:25.603 --> 01:40:27.264
Get me out of here!

1020
01:40:27.313 --> 01:40:28.644
Go.

1021
01:40:28.689 --> 01:40:29.689
Thank you.

1022
01:40:29.732 --> 01:40:31.347
Good luck.

1023
01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:34.062
Please. please. hurry. hurry.

1024
01:40:34.111 --> 01:40:35.772
Come on.

1025
01:40:40.326 --> 01:40:43.443
Grace! Run!

1026
01:40:43.496 --> 01:40:46.329
No. No. don't shoot.

1027
01:40:46.374 --> 01:40:48.740
Don't.

1028
01:40:51.295 --> 01:40:53.752
Started with your
precious husband.

1029
01:40:53.798 --> 01:40:55.538
I'm going to kill everyone
you've ever loved

1030
01:40:55.591 --> 01:40:58.458
or cared about until I find
your daughter.

1031
01:41:33.254 --> 01:41:35.620
Grace. come on. let's go.

1032
01:41:37.758 --> 01:41:41.376
Go. I'm not done yet.

1033
01:41:56.902 --> 01:41:59.644
For the love of god.

1034
01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:05.612
No. I know you.

1035
01:42:05.661 --> 01:42:07.117
You're a good woman.

1036
01:42:10.499 --> 01:42:11.989
Have mercy.

1037
01:42:12.043 --> 01:42:15.706
You stole all the mercy
from my heart.

1038
01:42:18.966 --> 01:42:20.797
Damn you.

1039
01:42:20.843 --> 01:42:22.674
You witch!

1040
01:43:00.758 --> 01:43:05.422
May god have mercy on my soul.

1041
01:43:28.869 --> 01:43:31.576
Oh. Joseph.

1042
01:43:32.873 --> 01:43:35.080
I want to be with you now.

1043
01:43:35.126 --> 01:43:38.618
Grace. you have to get up.

1044
01:43:38.671 --> 01:43:41.458
You have to live.

1045
01:43:41.507 --> 01:43:43.998
Abby's out there.
and she needs you now.

1046
01:43:44.051 --> 01:43:47.669
- Abby.
- Get up. my love.

1047
01:43:47.722 --> 01:43:50.179
Get up.

1048
01:44:32.308 --> 01:44:34.469
Are you hurt?

1049
01:44:34.518 --> 01:44:36.054
I'm not.

1050
01:44:36.103 --> 01:44:38.594
Who was that?

1051
01:44:38.647 --> 01:44:40.308
My husband.

1052
01:44:40.357 --> 01:44:41.563
What happened?

1053
01:44:44.904 --> 01:44:47.862
I know I'll surely hang.
I'm not ashamed.

1054
01:44:47.907 --> 01:44:50.398
There's been enough death
for one night.

1055
01:44:52.369 --> 01:44:55.861
Abby!

1056
01:44:55.915 --> 01:44:57.997
Why do you have her?
Where's grace?

1057
01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:03.161
Oh. lord. no.

1058
01:45:03.881 --> 01:45:06.293
Are you Kate Tobias?

1059
01:45:06.717 --> 01:45:07.923
I was.

1060
01:45:07.968 --> 01:45:09.799
Grace sent me to find you.

1061
01:45:09.845 --> 01:45:11.881
She said you'd know what to do.

1062
01:45:15.351 --> 01:45:18.058
I do.

1063
01:45:18.103 --> 01:45:19.559
We have to go.

1064
01:45:19.605 --> 01:45:21.561
Go? Go where?

1065
01:45:24.735 --> 01:45:29.695
Far from this place. You coming?
