3
00:01:43.842 --> 00:01:46.106
Daddy.
I'm scared. I miss Mommy.

4
00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:48.934
Marcus?

5
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.035
Uh-huh.

6
00:02:03.035 --> 00:02:04.907
Just remember for next time.

7
00:02:04.907 --> 00:02:07.214
I don't like meeting clients
this late at night.

8
00:02:07.214 --> 00:02:09.868
I know. I know. Trust me.

9
00:02:09.868 --> 00:02:13.133
But. look. you know
how the company is.
They need to close.

10
00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:15.483
And you're the best closer
the company has.

11
00:02:15.483 --> 00:02:17.572
What do you want me to do?
Do you want me to beg?

12
00:02:17.572 --> 00:02:19.487
No. you don't have to beg.

13
00:02:19.487 --> 00:02:21.619
But dinner...
that'd be nice.

14
00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:24.361
You got it. Call me
with some good news
when you're done.

15
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.735
Hey. what can I get you?

16
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.874
- How about a Shirley Temple?

17
00:02:58.874 --> 00:03:00.267
- Are you sure?

18
00:03:01.746 --> 00:03:02.834
I like to live dangerously.

19
00:03:03.792 --> 00:03:05.359
Okay.

20
00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:24.247
- Back to the other bar.

21
00:03:36.564 --> 00:03:38.087
- Hold on. Get lost.
- Hey.

22
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.748
Please. Please.

23
00:03:47.836 --> 00:03:49.316
I can pay--

24
00:05:05.609 --> 00:05:07.002
Yeah?

25
00:05:07.002 --> 00:05:09.221
-  How'd it go?

26
00:05:09.221 --> 00:05:11.920
- Like they all do.
- Good.

27
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.402
'Cause I got another client.
Rush job tomorrow.

28
00:05:15.402 --> 00:05:16.925
Tomorrow?

29
00:05:16.925 --> 00:05:19.319
Brother. my anniversary
is tomorrow.

30
00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:22.104
I got
a PTA meeting at 6:00.

31
00:05:22.104 --> 00:05:24.933
What? We have
a nine-to-five now?

32
00:05:24.933 --> 00:05:27.936
Come on. The world
doesn't stop for us.

33
00:05:34.421 --> 00:05:36.379
All right. What time?

34
00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:39.295
I'll call you with the details.
You're an ace. buddy.

35
00:05:39.904 --> 00:05:41.515
Live long and prosper.

36
00:05:41.515 --> 00:05:44.039
Yeah. yeah. the force
be with you too.

37
00:06:02.666 --> 00:06:04.102
- Let go.

38
00:06:04.102 --> 00:06:06.366
- What. what. what? I'm not.
- Stop that. Don't.

39
00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:07.845
Didn't do anything.

40
00:06:07.845 --> 00:06:08.977
- Don't.
- What?

41
00:06:08.977 --> 00:06:10.239
- You're doing it.
- I'm not.

42
00:06:10.239 --> 00:06:11.371
- You are!
- I'm not doing-- What. what?

43
00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:12.676
- You're doing it.
- I'm. I'm-- What?

44
00:06:20.945 --> 00:06:22.947
- Aah!
- Whoop.

45
00:06:33.044 --> 00:06:34.176
- Mommy?
- Hmm?

46
00:06:34.176 --> 00:06:35.743
Can I have
some more pancakes?

47
00:06:35.743 --> 00:06:37.658
Hmm. Yeah. okay.

48
00:06:37.658 --> 00:06:39.399
But how about just one.
because last time

49
00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:40.835
your eyes were too big
for your tummy

50
00:06:40.835 --> 00:06:42.706
and you got a bellyache.
Do you remember?

51
00:06:42.706 --> 00:06:45.013
Okay. but they're
so delicious.

52
00:06:45.013 --> 00:06:47.711
Well. I thank you for that.
They are pretty good.
aren't they?

53
00:06:47.711 --> 00:06:49.844
- Smells so good.

54
00:06:49.844 --> 00:06:52.499
- Oh. hey you.
- Mmm. Hey. yourself.

55
00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:54.544
- Daddy!

56
00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:04.685
Mm-hmm.

57
00:07:07.383 --> 00:07:09.864
-  Aha!

58
00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:13.868
- Aha!

59
00:07:13.868 --> 00:07:15.739
- La la la la la!
- La la la la la!

60
00:07:16.784 --> 00:07:18.612
Hey. how was work
last night?

61
00:07:18.612 --> 00:07:20.918
- Eventful.
- Another sale?

62
00:07:20.918 --> 00:07:22.006
Come on.

63
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:24.487
- Who are you talking to?
- Okay.

64
00:07:24.487 --> 00:07:25.793
Well. that's what
I like to hear.

65
00:07:25.793 --> 00:07:26.968
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

66
00:07:26.968 --> 00:07:28.622
- Mm-mm-mm.
- So...

67
00:07:28.622 --> 00:07:30.450
What are we gonna do tonight?

68
00:07:31.059 --> 00:07:32.452
- Tonight?
- Hmm.

69
00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:33.627
What do you
wanna do tonight?

70
00:07:35.411 --> 00:07:36.933
- I--
- Well. there's a game on.

71
00:07:39.067 --> 00:07:40.503
- You forgot. didn't you?
- Forgot?

72
00:07:42.636 --> 00:07:44.332
- About?
- Ugh.

73
00:07:44.332 --> 00:07:47.379
- You suck!
- Oh. [laughs] Come on.

74
00:07:47.379 --> 00:07:50.078
How could I forget about the day
I married my unicorn?

75
00:07:50.078 --> 00:07:51.558
- You better keep it that way.
- Mm-hmm.

76
00:07:51.558 --> 00:07:54.604
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm working on it. Mm-hmm.

77
00:07:54.604 --> 00:07:57.215
- Okay. I gotta go. Love you.
-  Bye.

78
00:07:57.215 --> 00:07:58.390
- Love you.
- I'll see you later.

79
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:59.870
- Daddy's got to work.
- Bye.

80
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.437
- Bye.
- Well.

81
00:08:01.437 --> 00:08:03.700
- guess it's just you
and me. hey. kiddo.
- Yeah.

82
00:08:11.708 --> 00:08:16.278
- Yeah?

83
00:08:16.278 --> 00:08:17.845
We're still on
for tonight. right?

84
00:08:17.845 --> 00:08:19.586
Eight p.m. at the Coal Train.

85
00:08:19.586 --> 00:08:21.109
The rest is
coming over by text.

86
00:08:21.892 --> 00:08:23.764
Right. tonight.
8:00 p.m. I got it.

87
00:09:57.335 --> 00:09:58.293
Mm...

88
00:10:00.556 --> 00:10:01.601
Marcus?

89
00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.561
Oh.
I'm so sorry.

90
00:10:23.057 --> 00:10:24.058
What do we have?

91
00:10:24.885 --> 00:10:25.799
This.

92
00:10:28.366 --> 00:10:30.630
- What the hell does that do?

93
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.284
The real question is
what can't it do?

94
00:10:34.895 --> 00:10:38.159
This is what they call
a "crystal matrix unit."

95
00:10:38.159 --> 00:10:40.509
It will replace hard
drives of any type.

96
00:10:40.509 --> 00:10:45.209
Each one of these
can contain data
of a million supercomputers.

97
00:10:47.211 --> 00:10:48.256
Marcus?

98
00:10:51.738 --> 00:10:56.743
If anything has a basis
for artificial intelligence.
this is it.

99
00:11:03.837 --> 00:11:05.447
Who are we selling it to?

100
00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:13.890
The Chinese.
then Arabs. Nigerians.
and of course. the Russians.

101
00:11:17.415 --> 00:11:18.503
Get up.

102
00:11:22.638 --> 00:11:23.726
Can I help you?

103
00:11:23.726 --> 00:11:24.814
H-hey. brother.

104
00:11:30.167 --> 00:11:32.822
Dimaz. what is going on?

105
00:11:36.478 --> 00:11:37.871
No. no. no. no. no. no!

106
00:12:01.155 --> 00:12:02.156
No. no!

107
00:13:01.737 --> 00:13:02.782
Marcus?

108
00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.615
Baby!

109
00:13:10.615 --> 00:13:12.792
Wait! No. no. no. No!

110
00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:14.881
Wait-- Kar--

111
00:13:16.926 --> 00:13:18.014
No!

112
00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.802
Baby! Baby.
baby. baby...

113
00:13:24.325 --> 00:13:25.587
Baby...

114
00:14:36.701 --> 00:14:39.269
Morning. Marc.
How'd you sleep?

115
00:14:40.618 --> 00:14:42.316
Good. good.

116
00:14:43.621 --> 00:14:45.319
- Coffee?

117
00:14:45.319 --> 00:14:47.321
Thanks. but I really
don't have time.

118
00:14:47.321 --> 00:14:49.540
I mean. I'm already
late for work.

119
00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.847
Marc. sit down.

120
00:15:06.644 --> 00:15:09.299
Ms. Aitkens. look. um.

121
00:15:09.299 --> 00:15:14.217
I am extremely grateful
that you moved in after Karla.

122
00:15:14.217 --> 00:15:16.741
How could I not wanna take care
of my own grandbaby?

123
00:15:18.439 --> 00:15:19.701
Still. I mean--

124
00:15:19.701 --> 00:15:21.224
This isn't about me. Marc.

125
00:15:22.095 --> 00:15:23.618
This is about you.

126
00:15:25.185 --> 00:15:27.187
You've got to start
living your life again.

127
00:15:28.231 --> 00:15:30.538
I notice it and Kimberley
notices it too.

128
00:15:30.538 --> 00:15:32.366
You're not happy.

129
00:15:32.366 --> 00:15:34.585
And when you're not happy.
that affects Kimberley.

130
00:15:34.585 --> 00:15:36.283
because she feels helpless.

131
00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:41.070
She's already lost her mother.

132
00:15:41.679 --> 00:15:43.899
She doesn't need to lose
her father as well.

133
00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:22.894
Don't worry. baby.

134
00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.942
I'll find out who did this.

135
00:16:58.582 --> 00:17:02.064

Happy birthday to you.

148
00:17:46.152 --> 00:17:47.283
Make a wish.

149
00:17:53.202 --> 00:17:55.900
-  Oh!
Good girl!
- There you go.

150
00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.119
What'd you wish for?

151
00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:01.297
I wished for Daddy
to be happy.

152
00:18:04.039 --> 00:18:06.911
Kiddo. Daddy is happy.

153
00:18:07.738 --> 00:18:09.827
And as long as
I have you. I'm happy.

154
00:18:09.827 --> 00:18:10.915
Come here.

155
00:18:16.007 --> 00:18:17.531
Okay. let's open
some presents.

156
00:18:17.531 --> 00:18:19.141
- Okay? Let's do it.

157
00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.536
Wonder what it is.

158
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:06.493
Mr. Garan. well. I can
assure you don't need that.

159
00:19:06.493 --> 00:19:07.972
- I'm only here to talk.
- May I?

160
00:19:09.409 --> 00:19:10.410
Thank you.

161
00:19:13.587 --> 00:19:15.110
How'd you find me?

162
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:16.851
We have our resources.

163
00:19:20.028 --> 00:19:22.291
I wanna know why you haven't
accepted my invitation.

164
00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:25.599
It's the opportunity
of a lifetime.

165
00:19:27.078 --> 00:19:28.993
Thanks. but no thanks.

166
00:19:30.299 --> 00:19:32.780
As you can see.
I have more important
things to do.

167
00:19:34.912 --> 00:19:36.436
We know who you are. Marcus.

168
00:19:37.306 --> 00:19:39.569
A former company man
with all the related benefits.

169
00:19:40.831 --> 00:19:42.442
And actually once
top of your game.

170
00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:47.447
Of course. within your limited
sphere of influence.

171
00:19:54.454 --> 00:19:57.979
We also know a tragic incident
took your wife

172
00:19:59.589 --> 00:20:00.938
and shattered your life.

173
00:20:01.896 --> 00:20:05.465
And for that. I offer
my deepest condolences.

174
00:20:06.553 --> 00:20:08.946
And now I know you're focused
on tracking her killer.

175
00:20:11.122 --> 00:20:12.863
Word in our community
travels fast.

176
00:20:14.256 --> 00:20:16.084
Now. I've offered you
a chance of a lifetime.

177
00:20:17.085 --> 00:20:18.565
Look after your family.

178
00:20:20.915 --> 00:20:23.265
You heard of Jorg Drakos?

179
00:20:25.876 --> 00:20:27.051
Who hasn't?

180
00:20:28.705 --> 00:20:30.794
Former Greek EYP lifer

181
00:20:31.578 --> 00:20:33.971
said to have killed more people
than the plague.

182
00:20:34.755 --> 00:20:37.714
Some say he's a myth.

183
00:20:40.717 --> 00:20:42.893
- What about him?
- The King of Killers.

184
00:20:44.155 --> 00:20:46.810
my employer.
he wants him eliminated.

185
00:20:47.724 --> 00:20:48.986
Who's your employer?

186
00:20:48.986 --> 00:20:50.814
Oh. come on.
you know the drill.

187
00:20:50.814 --> 00:20:53.252
Need-to-know basis.
but you don't need to know.

188
00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:54.949
Is that a fact?

189
00:20:56.211 --> 00:20:58.387
Let's cut the crap out. Marcus.

190
00:20:59.127 --> 00:21:00.911
I know you're interested.

191
00:21:05.699 --> 00:21:08.528
I gave up that life
a long time ago.

192
00:21:09.398 --> 00:21:11.313
I'm all my daughter's got left.

193
00:21:12.662 --> 00:21:13.620
Yes.

194
00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:16.623
But ten million dollars.

195
00:21:16.623 --> 00:21:20.540
that's enough to take care
of you and Kimberley
for the rest of your life.

196
00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.933
I mean. that will give her
the life that she deserves.

197
00:21:22.933 --> 00:21:25.501
a good education. a trust fund.

198
00:21:28.722 --> 00:21:31.420
It can't be easy being
a single parent these days.

199
00:21:35.511 --> 00:21:36.947
I'll be expecting your call.

200
00:21:38.601 --> 00:21:39.820
Let's talk soon. Mr. Garan.

201
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:42.562
Let's talk soon.

202
00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.918
Hello?

203
00:22:05.846 --> 00:22:10.198
Mr. Garan. Dr. Dean.
head of cardiac pediatrics.

204
00:22:10.198 --> 00:22:12.069
Hey. Doc.
Nice to meet you.

205
00:22:16.291 --> 00:22:17.640
What's wrong
with my daughter?

206
00:22:19.947 --> 00:22:21.514
Let's step over here.

207
00:22:28.956 --> 00:22:33.656
I'm sorry. but Kimberley's scan
shows an abnormally large heart.

208
00:22:33.656 --> 00:22:36.964
specifically affecting
her lower chambers.
her ventricles.

209
00:22:39.749 --> 00:22:41.534
I knew she had
a heart murmur. but--

210
00:22:41.534 --> 00:22:44.363
No. this is much more
serious than that.

211
00:22:44.363 --> 00:22:47.235
In fact. I daresay
she was misdiagnosed.

212
00:22:48.062 --> 00:22:50.586
Her heart is deteriorating.

213
00:22:52.196 --> 00:22:55.722
This will lead
to heart failure.

214
00:22:59.726 --> 00:23:01.554
-  Daddy?

215
00:23:01.554 --> 00:23:02.729
Hey. kiddo.

216
00:23:04.774 --> 00:23:07.690
- I'm right here.
Daddy's right here.

217
00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:09.431
Am I gonna be okay?

218
00:23:09.431 --> 00:23:12.391
Yeah. of course.
You'll be fine.

219
00:23:13.304 --> 00:23:14.262
Hey...

220
00:23:15.568 --> 00:23:18.527
God is gonna look
over you. and so will I.

221
00:23:22.792 --> 00:23:25.316
Hey. kiddo. look at me.

222
00:23:26.622 --> 00:23:28.015
It's you and me
forever. right?

223
00:23:28.015 --> 00:23:29.320
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

224
00:24:08.882 --> 00:24:10.492
-  Mr. Garan.
- I'm in.

225
00:24:19.545 --> 00:24:21.024
I knew you weren't finished.

226
00:24:23.157 --> 00:24:25.289
You're the best
the Alphabet Club ever had.

227
00:24:26.552 --> 00:24:29.119
- So. who's the client?
- Jorg Drakos.

228
00:24:29.119 --> 00:24:30.817
What? You're kidding.

229
00:24:33.036 --> 00:24:36.083
I doubt they even know
where he is.
Nobody's ever seen his face.

230
00:24:36.083 --> 00:24:37.345
You sure you want
a piece of that?

231
00:24:37.345 --> 00:24:38.433
No choice.

232
00:24:39.042 --> 00:24:41.349
Someone wants him dead.
And I need the money.

233
00:24:41.349 --> 00:24:43.743
You've never been motivated
by money before.

234
00:24:44.526 --> 00:24:45.571
What's changed?

235
00:24:45.571 --> 00:24:46.789
This is different.

236
00:24:52.012 --> 00:24:53.622
Are you okay?

237
00:24:53.622 --> 00:24:55.363
'Cause I know you've been
obsessing about Karla's death

238
00:24:55.363 --> 00:24:57.278
and trying to find out
who might have killed her.

239
00:24:58.453 --> 00:24:59.672
Obsessing?

240
00:24:59.672 --> 00:25:01.804
I didn't mean it like that
and you know it.

241
00:25:01.804 --> 00:25:03.371
I loved her like a sister. man.

242
00:25:04.851 --> 00:25:08.419
It's just-- I think
it was a matter of her
being at the wrong place

243
00:25:08.419 --> 00:25:10.334
- at the wrong time.
- It's Kimberley.

244
00:25:11.466 --> 00:25:13.990
- What?
- It's Kimberley.

245
00:25:15.644 --> 00:25:16.732
She's sick.

246
00:25:20.083 --> 00:25:21.824
She needs a new heart.

247
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.089
And what I have
just won't cover it.

248
00:25:28.091 --> 00:25:29.223
I'm sorry.

249
00:25:31.138 --> 00:25:32.835
Look. I got a little
something tucked away.

250
00:25:32.835 --> 00:25:35.229
- It's yours if you need it.
- I appreciate that.

251
00:25:36.317 --> 00:25:38.928
I really do.
But you have a family too.

252
00:25:41.409 --> 00:25:42.932
I got to do this.

253
00:25:42.932 --> 00:25:45.587
And it's the only way
I know how.

254
00:25:45.587 --> 00:25:46.762
I understand.

255
00:25:48.808 --> 00:25:49.765
Okay.

256
00:25:51.593 --> 00:25:54.640
I need a complete rundown
on Drakos.

257
00:25:55.466 --> 00:25:56.685
Problem is.

258
00:25:57.468 --> 00:25:59.732
I don't have
my security clearance anymore.

259
00:25:59.732 --> 00:26:00.689
Right.

260
00:26:02.735 --> 00:26:04.127
Let me see what I can do.

261
00:26:05.302 --> 00:26:08.262
So. where are they sending you?

262
00:26:50.043 --> 00:26:52.175
Mr. Garan.

263
00:26:53.612 --> 00:26:57.050
I am so happy
you decided to come.

264
00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.967
Mr. Korza. one last hurrah.

265
00:27:00.967 --> 00:27:02.055
Indeed.

266
00:27:02.882 --> 00:27:05.232
You're expected
in the penthouse.

267
00:27:05.232 --> 00:27:08.017
My assistant. Mrs. Ueno.

268
00:27:08.017 --> 00:27:09.845
is waiting for us
at the elevator.

269
00:27:09.845 --> 00:27:11.325
Let's get started.

270
00:27:36.916 --> 00:27:38.221
What's this?

271
00:27:38.221 --> 00:27:39.919
I thought
I was working alone.

272
00:27:40.702 --> 00:27:43.531
Don't get your knickers
in a twist. Mr. Garan.
All in good time.

273
00:27:44.271 --> 00:27:45.446
All in good time.

274
00:28:02.681 --> 00:28:05.945
Well. I'm glad
you all can make it.

275
00:28:06.989 --> 00:28:10.253
Now. I know how eager
you all are to get started.

276
00:28:10.253 --> 00:28:12.995
So. let's make this brief.

277
00:28:12.995 --> 00:28:15.824
I had no idea
I was gonna be part of a team.

278
00:28:15.824 --> 00:28:17.652
I work alone.

279
00:28:17.652 --> 00:28:20.002
I don't need these lame ducks
getting in my way.

280
00:28:20.002 --> 00:28:21.308
Hmpf.

281
00:28:22.483 --> 00:28:24.050
Man. who you calling
a "lame duck"?

282
00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.879
- I'm looking at one.
- Oh. really now?

283
00:28:28.619 --> 00:28:30.230
Gentleman. gentleman.

284
00:28:31.187 --> 00:28:34.364
Please. I think it's time
you met my employer.

285
00:28:38.412 --> 00:28:39.630
Hello.

286
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:41.023
Oh. it's good to see you all.

287
00:28:41.023 --> 00:28:42.068
Thank you for coming.

288
00:28:42.808 --> 00:28:44.026
Hope you had a good trip in.

289
00:28:44.026 --> 00:28:45.288
You set all this up?

290
00:28:45.288 --> 00:28:46.376
I did.

291
00:28:47.073 --> 00:28:49.423
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

292
00:28:49.423 --> 00:28:52.078
That's good question. I...

293
00:28:53.122 --> 00:28:54.471
I'm your employer.

294
00:28:55.472 --> 00:28:58.084
I'm also a great admirer
of your work.

295
00:28:58.084 --> 00:29:00.826
You're all the very best
in the world at what you do.

296
00:29:00.826 --> 00:29:03.350
which make you worthy
for the task at hand.

297
00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.571
Marcus Garan.

298
00:29:08.659 --> 00:29:12.663
multidisciplinary "wetman"
for the US Intelligence Community

299
00:29:12.663 --> 00:29:14.491
with foreign loan-out options

300
00:29:16.189 --> 00:29:19.496
till an unfortunate accident
took out the love of his life.

301
00:29:20.367 --> 00:29:21.934
That is too bad.

302
00:29:24.632 --> 00:29:27.548
Scott Angus. deposed J2 member

303
00:29:27.548 --> 00:29:30.725
and client of any organized
good guys. or even terrorists.

304
00:29:30.725 --> 00:29:32.596
with the right amount
of legal tender.

305
00:29:33.684 --> 00:29:35.034
You like your money.

306
00:29:36.078 --> 00:29:38.951
Only hit the wrong mark
setting off a war
between terrorist factions.

307
00:29:38.951 --> 00:29:41.692
Now. they all want you dead.

308
00:29:43.259 --> 00:29:45.653
Asha Khanna.

309
00:29:45.653 --> 00:29:48.482
MI6 operative
for the past 15 years.

310
00:29:48.482 --> 00:29:52.834
could have any agency
position she wanted.
but got tired of the rat race.

311
00:29:53.617 --> 00:29:54.967
Dyson Chord.

312
00:29:55.881 --> 00:29:59.188
former Marine Force
recon Commander
for the elite Darkstorms unit

313
00:29:59.188 --> 00:30:01.974
and NSA sweeper.

314
00:30:03.802 --> 00:30:04.933
Rick Nigel.

315
00:30:06.456 --> 00:30:08.328
freelance ASIS employee.

316
00:30:08.328 --> 00:30:10.373
Played too many sides
once too often

317
00:30:10.373 --> 00:30:12.201
that he almost put
a hit on himself.

318
00:30:12.201 --> 00:30:13.594
Who writes this stuff?

319
00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.642
A man known as Ren.

320
00:30:19.339 --> 00:30:22.995
Miyacho-trained.
protector of the Rising Sun.
until loyalties changed

321
00:30:22.995 --> 00:30:25.084
and started working
for the highest bidder.

322
00:30:27.216 --> 00:30:28.391
And last.

323
00:30:28.391 --> 00:30:30.045
Zachary Hebron.

324
00:30:30.045 --> 00:30:32.308
freelance sniper
for a private military company.

325
00:30:32.308 --> 00:30:35.007
Following orders is not
exactly his strong suit.

326
00:30:37.661 --> 00:30:38.706
Wow!

327
00:30:39.663 --> 00:30:40.926
Wow. wow. wow.

328
00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:44.625
Checkmate. Yeah.

329
00:30:44.625 --> 00:30:47.976
I do have a bit
of a confession to make.

330
00:30:47.976 --> 00:30:50.196
You're probably wondering
about your quarry.

331
00:30:50.196 --> 00:30:52.111
The assassin
they say is the best.

332
00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:53.982
Drakos?

333
00:30:53.982 --> 00:30:56.115
- No one's even seen his face.
-  No.

334
00:30:56.855 --> 00:30:58.813
Maybe he's not that
good-looking.

335
00:30:59.683 --> 00:31:02.861
Look. I just wanna get
this thing started.
so I can collect my money.

336
00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:04.471
That'll be the day. mate.

337
00:31:05.385 --> 00:31:07.909
- What?
- Yeah. you heard me.

338
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:09.302
How about I give you
a running head start?

339
00:31:09.302 --> 00:31:10.781
Anytime. mate.

340
00:31:10.781 --> 00:31:12.522
- Anytime.

341
00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.570
No. Patience is a virtue.
Mr. Hebron.

342
00:31:18.137 --> 00:31:20.095
But I do have some...

343
00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:22.358
bad news.

344
00:31:23.055 --> 00:31:25.405
I don't know what
you've been told.
I really don't care.

345
00:31:25.405 --> 00:31:28.321
I just. uh. want you to know
that this isn't
your typical contract.

346
00:31:29.235 --> 00:31:30.758
Then what is it?

347
00:31:30.758 --> 00:31:33.456
It's more like a competition.

348
00:31:33.456 --> 00:31:35.676
- What?
- A game!

349
00:31:35.676 --> 00:31:37.547
A game. a competition.

350
00:31:38.897 --> 00:31:43.640
See who's the best
by killing the best.

351
00:31:45.033 --> 00:31:46.121
Jorg Drakos.

352
00:31:46.774 --> 00:31:50.691
Okay. wait.
you want us to compete

353
00:31:50.691 --> 00:31:53.128
to see which one of us
can get to him first.

354
00:31:53.128 --> 00:31:54.216
Yes.

355
00:31:57.611 --> 00:31:59.569
Well. this should be fun.

356
00:31:59.569 --> 00:32:02.311
No. no. I'm out.

357
00:32:02.311 --> 00:32:04.835
Oh. this game
you'll play. Mr. Hebron.

358
00:32:06.489 --> 00:32:08.883
- Oh. yeah? Why is that?
-  Mr. Hebron.

359
00:32:10.363 --> 00:32:12.234
See. I think you should
change your mind.

360
00:32:13.148 --> 00:32:15.194
It's not really a good idea.

361
00:32:16.151 --> 00:32:17.544
You lied to us
in the beginning.

362
00:32:19.111 --> 00:32:20.721
The way I see it
is I don't know you.

363
00:32:21.635 --> 00:32:24.333
I don't know your boss.
And I sure as hell
don't trust you.

364
00:32:24.333 --> 00:32:25.944
Anybody else
care to join?

365
00:32:27.815 --> 00:32:28.859
Killer queen?

366
00:32:29.469 --> 00:32:30.513
Not I.

367
00:32:30.513 --> 00:32:31.819
Green Mile?

368
00:32:32.863 --> 00:32:33.821
No?

369
00:32:36.955 --> 00:32:38.130
See you. mate.

370
00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:39.218
I'm out.

371
00:32:45.311 --> 00:32:47.487
I told you. mate.

372
00:32:47.966 --> 00:32:49.532
That'll be the day.
I told you that.

373
00:32:57.584 --> 00:32:59.368
Now you know how serious I am.

374
00:33:00.543 --> 00:33:02.806
Nobody leaves
until the game is finished.

375
00:33:02.806 --> 00:33:04.417
His bloody head's
off his shoulders.

376
00:33:05.374 --> 00:33:07.811
- You deceived us.
- Maybe.

377
00:33:07.811 --> 00:33:08.812
Maybe.

378
00:33:10.205 --> 00:33:12.947
But I expect you all to play
to the best of your abilities.

379
00:33:12.947 --> 00:33:15.210
Your lives depend on it.
You understand me?

380
00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:17.604
We don't even know
what Drakos looks like.

381
00:33:19.084 --> 00:33:20.128
Sure you do.

382
00:33:23.349 --> 00:33:26.482
You are Drakos-san.

383
00:33:30.704 --> 00:33:31.748
I am.

384
00:33:35.622 --> 00:33:37.363
Wait. I'm not getting this.

385
00:33:37.363 --> 00:33:39.365
Why hire us to kill you?

386
00:33:39.365 --> 00:33:41.323
Why?

387
00:33:42.107 --> 00:33:43.543
I love "why" questions.

388
00:33:45.545 --> 00:33:46.850
What does it all mean?

389
00:33:47.938 --> 00:33:49.505
I'm the best.
I've done it all.

390
00:33:51.768 --> 00:33:53.074
I've conquered it all.

391
00:33:54.423 --> 00:33:55.642
Except for one thing.

392
00:33:57.078 --> 00:33:59.341
The elimination of my peers.

393
00:34:00.212 --> 00:34:03.476
You. the other assassins.

394
00:34:03.476 --> 00:34:05.043
to see who really is the best.

395
00:34:07.262 --> 00:34:11.005
And you expect us
to go along with that?

396
00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:13.442
Is that right?

397
00:34:14.791 --> 00:34:17.315
Well. you could ask Mr. Hebron
that question.

398
00:34:19.927 --> 00:34:21.536
I trust you understand.

399
00:34:24.496 --> 00:34:25.715
The job is simple.

400
00:34:27.065 --> 00:34:29.284
To kill me. King of Killers.

401
00:34:30.068 --> 00:34:31.286
How fun does that sound?

402
00:34:36.987 --> 00:34:38.859
But I want you to get
some rest first.

403
00:34:38.859 --> 00:34:40.339
Mr. Korza is gonna
hand you a card.

404
00:34:40.339 --> 00:34:41.949
give you access
to my entire facility.

405
00:34:41.949 --> 00:34:43.646
It's a wonderful place.

406
00:34:43.646 --> 00:34:45.083
You can sleep. you can eat.

407
00:34:45.083 --> 00:34:46.649
you can work out
to your heart's content.

408
00:34:46.649 --> 00:34:47.955
Why. thank you.

409
00:34:47.955 --> 00:34:50.827
In 24 hours. you have one job.

410
00:34:51.915 --> 00:34:53.699
and that is to kill me.

411
00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:57.834
or I can guarantee
I will kill you.

412
00:34:59.271 --> 00:35:02.100
Now. we have a light
supper and. uh. tea

413
00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:03.492
in the lobby
of the hotel later.

414
00:35:03.492 --> 00:35:05.015
I expect all of you
to be there.

415
00:35:07.322 --> 00:35:08.541
See you later.

416
00:35:14.503 --> 00:35:17.724
Well. I hope
that was informative.

417
00:35:19.508 --> 00:35:23.338
You have 24 hours to prepare.

418
00:35:23.338 --> 00:35:26.602
Please. use your time wisely.

419
00:35:26.602 --> 00:35:30.128
'cause it may be the last time
you have left on this earth.

420
00:35:31.955 --> 00:35:36.917
And. uh. if anyone else
should have any ideas

421
00:35:36.917 --> 00:35:39.615
to depart this event early.

422
00:35:39.615 --> 00:35:41.139
just remember one thing.

423
00:35:42.531 --> 00:35:44.925
someone is always watching.

424
00:36:57.389 --> 00:36:59.565
Curiosity killed
the cat. you know.

425
00:37:02.089 --> 00:37:05.179
Lucky for you. Asha.
You always land on your feet.

426
00:37:06.528 --> 00:37:07.529
Lucky me.

427
00:37:09.357 --> 00:37:11.446
It's good
to see you. Garan.

428
00:37:11.446 --> 00:37:12.708
Stop lying.

429
00:37:14.232 --> 00:37:16.886
Last time we saw each other.
you tried to take me out.

430
00:37:16.886 --> 00:37:18.323
Well. you deserved it.

431
00:37:19.933 --> 00:37:21.891
Playing doubles
with the Alphabet Squad

432
00:37:21.891 --> 00:37:25.591
doesn't exactly make
for influencing people
or making new friends.

433
00:37:27.462 --> 00:37:29.159
But I forgive you.

434
00:37:29.159 --> 00:37:33.120
So. why are you here?

435
00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.208
Listen.

436
00:37:37.124 --> 00:37:38.604
I heard about Karla.

437
00:37:41.171 --> 00:37:42.260
Let's not.

438
00:37:42.999 --> 00:37:43.957
Okay.

439
00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.961
- Then business it is.

440
00:37:47.961 --> 00:37:50.137
What do you know about Drakos?

441
00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:54.315
Other than he's
standing in my way
of ten million dollars. Nothing.

442
00:37:54.315 --> 00:37:55.360
Really?

443
00:37:57.013 --> 00:37:58.276
Now who's lying?

444
00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:01.757
Okay.

445
00:38:03.585 --> 00:38:06.327
What I know is
he's holding all the cards.

446
00:38:06.327 --> 00:38:08.286
His turf. his rules.

447
00:38:08.286 --> 00:38:12.246
And if I didn't know any better.
I'd say that's not a window.

448
00:38:15.902 --> 00:38:17.295
A monitor.

449
00:38:19.035 --> 00:38:20.080
Doesn't matter.

450
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:22.300
I have nothing to hide.

451
00:38:22.996 --> 00:38:24.650
Just everything to lose.

452
00:38:27.305 --> 00:38:30.177
- All I know is I need to win.
- To win...

453
00:38:30.917 --> 00:38:32.353
that prize.

454
00:38:37.706 --> 00:38:38.751
We'll see.

455
00:38:40.013 --> 00:38:43.321
- Death is just a part of life.

456
00:39:13.263 --> 00:39:14.308
What is this?

457
00:39:15.091 --> 00:39:18.356
He's our host.
showing us a good time

458
00:39:19.574 --> 00:39:23.012
right before one of us
takes him out.

459
00:39:24.274 --> 00:39:25.450
Sure.

460
00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:27.103
I'd love a nice spot of tea

461
00:39:27.103 --> 00:39:28.453
before I carve my name

462
00:39:28.453 --> 00:39:29.671
into his chest.

463
00:39:34.937 --> 00:39:36.374
Contestants.

464
00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:40.160
it is with great pleasure

465
00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:42.815
that the esteemed Mr. Drakos

466
00:39:42.815 --> 00:39:45.121
welcomes you to Japan.

467
00:39:46.427 --> 00:39:51.084
This is a simple dinner
like a thank you

468
00:39:51.084 --> 00:39:53.391
for being competitors
in our event.

469
00:39:54.653 --> 00:39:57.351
Or perhaps. for some of you.

470
00:39:58.396 --> 00:39:59.701
a last supper.

471
00:40:03.531 --> 00:40:05.968
What? We get a door prize too?

472
00:40:05.968 --> 00:40:07.535
So. where is Drakos?

473
00:40:08.144 --> 00:40:09.798
- I am here.

474
00:40:11.974 --> 00:40:14.368
Call me superstitious.
but I don't like to see
the participants

475
00:40:14.368 --> 00:40:15.543
before the event.

476
00:40:17.327 --> 00:40:19.591
Kind of like the groom
shouldn't see the bride
before the wedding.

477
00:40:19.591 --> 00:40:21.419
You leave
nothing to chance.

478
00:40:21.419 --> 00:40:22.768
You catch on quick.

479
00:40:23.551 --> 00:40:25.814
But never mind
all that for now.

480
00:40:26.598 --> 00:40:30.210
Tonight. I want you to enjoy
a well-deserved respite.
Agreed?

481
00:40:31.516 --> 00:40:32.604
A toast.

482
00:40:33.605 --> 00:40:34.954
Gentlemen and lady.

483
00:40:36.085 --> 00:40:37.957
Thank you for accepting
my offer.

484
00:40:39.524 --> 00:40:40.568
Welcome to Japan.

485
00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:43.223
May we fight hard

486
00:40:44.659 --> 00:40:45.747
and die with honor.

487
00:40:48.794 --> 00:40:51.274
Cheers. Till tomorrow.

488
00:41:08.901 --> 00:41:10.119
Enjoy your dinner.

489
00:41:11.251 --> 00:41:12.295
Until later.

490
00:41:23.785 --> 00:41:26.309
You know.
it's really interesting.

491
00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:29.791
Here we are.
the best in the world
at what we do.

492
00:41:29.791 --> 00:41:31.793
And none of us
have ever really met.

493
00:41:32.533 --> 00:41:34.056
Some of us have.

494
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:36.145
A lifetime ago.

495
00:41:39.018 --> 00:41:39.975
Yeah.

496
00:41:41.237 --> 00:41:44.458
It's a small world we live in.
isn't it. boys?

497
00:41:44.458 --> 00:41:46.199
Reputations
are like that.

498
00:41:46.199 --> 00:41:50.856
CIA. FBI. NSA. MI6.

499
00:41:50.856 --> 00:41:52.727
They always make sure
we're informed.

500
00:41:52.727 --> 00:41:55.121
even if you're
on the other side.

501
00:41:55.121 --> 00:41:57.079
Something doesn't sit right.

502
00:41:57.079 --> 00:42:01.867
I'm thinking this contest
has nothing to do
with money. or ego.

503
00:42:02.955 --> 00:42:04.086
She ain't wrong.

504
00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:07.176
What's this old boy up to? Hmm?

505
00:42:07.176 --> 00:42:08.830
Don't look a gift horse
in the mouth.

506
00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:11.441
fool and his money
will soon part.

507
00:42:11.441 --> 00:42:14.662
and this fool
will make sure it does.

508
00:42:14.662 --> 00:42:16.882
We're all. uh. happy
with that. are we?

509
00:42:16.882 --> 00:42:19.275
I think our boy here
is looking for a thrill.

510
00:42:19.275 --> 00:42:21.887
Is he. mate?
Is that what he's after?

511
00:42:22.714 --> 00:42:24.324
- Do you know something
we don't know?
-  Please. please.

512
00:42:24.324 --> 00:42:25.891
please. please.

513
00:42:25.891 --> 00:42:27.501
Think about it.

514
00:42:27.501 --> 00:42:29.503
How is this different
than any other contract

515
00:42:29.503 --> 00:42:31.418
we've ever taken. huh?

516
00:42:35.465 --> 00:42:36.641
Have to take this.

517
00:42:38.773 --> 00:42:39.992
Is it that important?

518
00:42:41.123 --> 00:42:42.777
So. how's she doing?

519
00:42:42.777 --> 00:42:44.039
Oh. she's fine.

520
00:42:44.039 --> 00:42:45.954
She just wanted
to say good night.

521
00:42:45.954 --> 00:42:48.261
Good night.
Daddy. I love you.

522
00:42:48.261 --> 00:42:50.959
I love you to the moon
and back and back again.

523
00:42:50.959 --> 00:42:52.700
Good night. Peanut.

524
00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:54.267
When are you coming home?

525
00:42:54.267 --> 00:42:57.183
As soon as I can. kiddo.
As soon as I can.

526
00:42:58.401 --> 00:42:59.968
I miss you.

527
00:42:59.968 --> 00:43:02.667
Oh. I miss you so much.

528
00:43:03.406 --> 00:43:06.845
Okay? Sweet dreams.
I'll see you very soon.

529
00:43:06.845 --> 00:43:07.976
Bye.

530
00:43:10.544 --> 00:43:11.937
Asha. I know you're there.

531
00:43:14.113 --> 00:43:15.723
Now. that was beautiful.

532
00:43:16.855 --> 00:43:17.769
So...

533
00:43:19.335 --> 00:43:21.642
how should we play this game?

534
00:43:21.642 --> 00:43:23.601
This is the same game
we've always played.

535
00:43:24.819 --> 00:43:25.777
Wow.

536
00:43:26.865 --> 00:43:29.868
You really have changed.
haven't you?

537
00:43:29.868 --> 00:43:31.217
What are you doing?

538
00:43:31.217 --> 00:43:35.090
I'm just picking up
where we left off.

539
00:43:39.747 --> 00:43:43.185
The less of us there are.
the better the chance
of winning.

540
00:43:54.457 --> 00:43:56.546
You don't have to do this.
It's not about us.

541
00:43:57.809 --> 00:43:59.288
Don't flatter yourself.

542
00:44:24.444 --> 00:44:28.230
So. I guess
you don't always land
on your feet now. do you?

543
00:45:19.673 --> 00:45:22.589
Daddy.
I'm scared. I miss Mommy.

544
00:45:22.589 --> 00:45:24.069
Oh. kiddo.

545
00:45:25.244 --> 00:45:29.988
Listen. your Mommy
is an angel now
and she lives in the stars.

546
00:45:30.989 --> 00:45:33.905
So anytime you miss Mommy.
all you have to do.

547
00:45:33.905 --> 00:45:37.517
you look up at the stars
and you can talk to her.

548
00:45:38.387 --> 00:45:41.303
And know that she's always
looking over you.

549
00:45:41.303 --> 00:45:42.740
Okay? So. here's
what we're gonna do.

550
00:45:43.653 --> 00:45:45.351
Look at this star.

551
00:45:45.351 --> 00:45:47.353
I'm gonna put some stars
right above your bed.

552
00:45:47.353 --> 00:45:49.311
So anytime
you wanna talk to Mommy.

553
00:45:49.311 --> 00:45:52.227
all you have to do is look up
and talk to her.

554
00:46:23.650 --> 00:46:25.260
You don't say much. do you?

555
00:46:26.871 --> 00:46:30.570
Only when there is something
that needs to be said.

556
00:46:32.572 --> 00:46:33.703
Contestants.

557
00:46:36.576 --> 00:46:40.841
I trust we are all well-rested
and refreshed.

558
00:46:41.494 --> 00:46:43.061
Just eager to get started.

559
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:46.499
So you should be. Mr. Chord.
So you should be.

560
00:46:47.892 --> 00:46:52.374
Now. we of course know
the exact tool you use
in your line of work.

561
00:46:53.593 --> 00:46:54.768
down to the blade

562
00:46:56.422 --> 00:46:57.640
and to your caliber.

563
00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:02.950
Here. you will find
everything you need.

564
00:47:04.473 --> 00:47:08.173
Please come
and feast your eyes.

565
00:47:20.141 --> 00:47:22.100
That's what I'm talking about.

566
00:47:25.581 --> 00:47:28.802
Not the sniper rifle
I'm used to. But this will do.

567
00:47:40.031 --> 00:47:42.947
Well. I trust they're all
to your satisfaction?

568
00:47:42.947 --> 00:47:44.339
Are they ever?

569
00:47:44.339 --> 00:47:46.907
So. how does this work?

570
00:47:46.907 --> 00:47:48.648
- Is it a game of hide
and seek. or what?

571
00:47:48.648 --> 00:47:50.693
In a manner of speaking. yes.

572
00:47:53.783 --> 00:47:56.003
You're all gonna draw a coin
from that bag.

573
00:47:56.003 --> 00:47:58.136
determine which order
you'll face me.

574
00:47:58.832 --> 00:47:59.877
Low coin goes first.

575
00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:02.314
High coin goes last.

576
00:48:04.882 --> 00:48:06.622
Please. take one.

577
00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.238
Five.

578
00:48:15.675 --> 00:48:16.632
Seven.

579
00:48:19.157 --> 00:48:20.332
Eight.

580
00:48:23.988 --> 00:48:25.119
Two.

581
00:48:28.601 --> 00:48:29.863
Damn. six.

582
00:48:32.735 --> 00:48:33.693
Tsk.

583
00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:35.782
I guess I go first.

584
00:48:35.782 --> 00:48:37.218
No. you're not.

585
00:48:41.396 --> 00:48:43.703
- And when I get back...

586
00:48:43.703 --> 00:48:45.009
...dinner's on me.

587
00:48:56.237 --> 00:48:57.543
If he makes it back.

588
00:49:15.561 --> 00:49:16.518
Hey.

589
00:49:18.129 --> 00:49:19.130
Look at this.

590
00:49:28.226 --> 00:49:30.880
Ah. Angus. going first.

591
00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:33.535
Always the good guy.
Always the hero.

592
00:49:36.234 --> 00:49:37.757
Ain't that right?

593
00:49:37.757 --> 00:49:40.934
But this time. rushing in
to save the day

594
00:49:40.934 --> 00:49:42.718
might be the very
last thing you do.

595
00:49:42.718 --> 00:49:44.851
Drakos won't
make this one easy.

596
00:49:45.765 --> 00:49:47.114
He's not supposed to.

597
00:50:23.629 --> 00:50:24.717
What's he doing?

598
00:50:28.590 --> 00:50:29.809
What's going on here?

599
00:50:33.987 --> 00:50:35.119
It's a trap.

600
00:51:11.329 --> 00:51:12.591
What's he doing?

601
00:51:14.114 --> 00:51:16.073
- I mean...

602
00:51:35.353 --> 00:51:36.745
He's lost already.

603
00:51:36.745 --> 00:51:38.225
You are right.

604
00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:56.809
He's fast.

605
00:52:00.073 --> 00:52:01.901
You thought this was
gonna be easy. didn't ya?

606
00:52:26.665 --> 00:52:27.709
Where are you?

607
00:52:32.105 --> 00:52:33.280
- Where are you?

608
00:52:38.633 --> 00:52:39.895
Where are you?

609
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:20.197
I will kill you.

610
00:53:20.806 --> 00:53:22.068
Yeah.

611
00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:47.963
Y'all know you're never
gonna win this.

612
00:53:47.963 --> 00:53:49.530
But I love your spirit.

613
00:53:59.279 --> 00:54:01.281
We're going about this
the wrong way.

614
00:54:03.414 --> 00:54:05.807
Look at the terminology he uses.

615
00:54:05.807 --> 00:54:08.114
the layout
of the floors.

616
00:54:08.114 --> 00:54:09.550
He set this whole thing up.

617
00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:11.422
It's a chess game.
We know this.

618
00:54:11.422 --> 00:54:14.251
Not a chess game.
A game of chance.

619
00:54:15.382 --> 00:54:17.341
Don't you get it?
He's a gambler.

620
00:54:17.341 --> 00:54:19.952
and gamblers
love high stakes.

621
00:54:21.606 --> 00:54:22.911
We can't win...

622
00:54:24.391 --> 00:54:26.828
'cause the house always wins.

623
00:54:26.828 --> 00:54:27.829
Gentlemen.

624
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:29.091
And lady.

625
00:54:29.091 --> 00:54:30.658
Do we have a problem here?

626
00:54:31.833 --> 00:54:33.922
We have to change
the rules on him.

627
00:54:33.922 --> 00:54:35.054
How?

628
00:54:35.054 --> 00:54:37.839
We tell him
we'll only continue

629
00:54:37.839 --> 00:54:39.537
if he takes on
all of us at once.

630
00:54:41.669 --> 00:54:43.671
- What?
- He'll never go for it.

631
00:54:43.671 --> 00:54:47.588
Maybe. But I know
that the only way
we survive this

632
00:54:48.807 --> 00:54:50.548
is if we work together.

633
00:54:51.157 --> 00:54:52.854
Then we split the prize.

634
00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:58.643
- I concur.
- So do I.

635
00:54:59.513 --> 00:55:00.427
Ren?

636
00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:07.129
I think it's weak.

637
00:55:07.129 --> 00:55:08.783
So you have
a better idea?

638
00:55:08.783 --> 00:55:12.570
Yeah. We scrap.
and we find out
who's the best.

639
00:55:12.570 --> 00:55:14.311
Perfect. Then you go next.

640
00:55:14.311 --> 00:55:16.661
Whoa. big fella.
It's not my turn.

641
00:55:16.661 --> 00:55:21.753
Well. you're the only one
who wants to keep on fighting
in this death trap.

642
00:55:21.753 --> 00:55:23.624
So. you wanna be a fool?

643
00:55:24.625 --> 00:55:26.366
You know what?
Knock yourself out.

644
00:55:26.366 --> 00:55:28.847
- You're a coward.
- Who's next?

645
00:55:28.847 --> 00:55:30.196
You're not even worth it.

646
00:55:30.805 --> 00:55:31.893
I don't have all day.

647
00:55:33.112 --> 00:55:34.853
I don't care who it is.

648
00:55:34.853 --> 00:55:37.116
But someone has got to get
in the elevator.

649
00:55:39.336 --> 00:55:41.294
You led us here
under false pretenses.

650
00:55:42.382 --> 00:55:46.560
We were led to believe
we'd be hunting you
under much different conditions.

651
00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:48.170
The game is rigged.

652
00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:52.131
Like the Greeks say.
the rules are the rules.

653
00:55:52.131 --> 00:55:56.309
And I say these rules
are the only way you can win.

654
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:57.528
But that's okay.

655
00:55:58.964 --> 00:56:00.182
I have a proposition for you.

656
00:56:01.314 --> 00:56:05.797
After all. you are a gentleman
and a gamesman. right?

657
00:56:06.667 --> 00:56:09.496
Not exactly. But I'll bite.

658
00:56:10.236 --> 00:56:13.239
All of us versus you simultaneously.

659
00:56:13.239 --> 00:56:15.850
No deal. That's not
how the game is played.

660
00:56:16.895 --> 00:56:18.592
So. you.

661
00:56:18.592 --> 00:56:21.769
the King of Killers.
is admitting he can't win?

662
00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:24.816
Because if that's the case.
you're not the best.

663
00:56:25.469 --> 00:56:28.472
You had to stack the deck
in order to achieve victory.

664
00:56:28.472 --> 00:56:29.603
which...

665
00:56:31.039 --> 00:56:35.914
really isn't the game of skill
you relish so much now. is it?

666
00:56:39.134 --> 00:56:43.051
Now the other way. my way.
is a true game of skill.

667
00:56:43.051 --> 00:56:45.793
Our numbers versus your traps.

668
00:56:49.754 --> 00:56:52.409
Come on. Drakos.
you're the king.

669
00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:57.414
Does the king care
to make a wager?

670
00:57:00.591 --> 00:57:02.070
Is this psychology?

671
00:57:03.245 --> 00:57:04.421
I think I like it.

672
00:57:07.598 --> 00:57:09.077
You have a deal.

673
00:57:09.077 --> 00:57:11.297
- Let's go.
- Oh. wait. wait.
wait. wait. wait.

674
00:57:12.298 --> 00:57:14.256
I do have one wrinkle.

675
00:57:15.606 --> 00:57:16.694
Of course. you do.

676
00:57:17.956 --> 00:57:18.957
Four.

677
00:57:19.479 --> 00:57:21.350
I'll only take four of you.

678
00:57:21.350 --> 00:57:24.832
So. one of us has to stay here.

679
00:57:24.832 --> 00:57:27.618
Well. I think you know me
a little better than that.

680
00:57:29.228 --> 00:57:30.882
One of you has
to be eliminated.

681
00:57:32.361 --> 00:57:33.928
One of you has to die.

682
00:57:34.581 --> 00:57:36.235
or all of you have to die.

683
00:57:36.235 --> 00:57:37.715
Your choice.

684
00:57:51.293 --> 00:57:53.295
- Wife killer!

685
00:57:57.343 --> 00:57:58.823
How dare you!

686
00:58:00.607 --> 00:58:02.217
Guys. guys!

687
00:58:05.873 --> 00:58:07.571
I hate to break this up.

688
00:58:09.094 --> 00:58:10.312
Chord's gone.

689
00:58:19.147 --> 00:58:21.280
They say that all
those horrible things
you did as an operative

690
00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:22.847
finally got to you.

691
00:58:22.847 --> 00:58:25.545
And after so many years
of decorated service.

692
00:58:25.545 --> 00:58:26.677
that's why you quit.

693
00:58:28.374 --> 00:58:30.724
But did you. Chord?

694
00:58:30.724 --> 00:58:32.552
Did you really walk away
from the game?

695
00:58:32.552 --> 00:58:34.075
I don't think so.

696
00:58:34.075 --> 00:58:36.251
Once a player. always a player.

697
00:58:36.251 --> 00:58:37.949
Just a different team.

698
00:58:37.949 --> 00:58:40.168
So why walk away
from this team too?

699
00:58:40.168 --> 00:58:42.780
You looking
for absolution. Chord?

700
00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:44.085
Well. come and get it.

701
00:58:55.401 --> 00:58:57.621
Where are you hiding this time?

702
00:59:03.104 --> 00:59:04.192
Drakos!

703
00:59:05.063 --> 00:59:06.194
Where are you?

704
00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:08.588
You scared?

705
00:59:18.076 --> 00:59:19.686
It's the calm before the storm.

706
00:59:39.706 --> 00:59:41.229
What's he reacting to?

707
00:59:42.709 --> 00:59:43.754
I don't know.

708
01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:03.415
Now we begin.

709
01:02:17.472 --> 01:02:19.953
You heard the man. Gear up.

710
01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:22.216
Cellphones on radio mode.

711
01:02:24.088 --> 01:02:25.306
Aye. Cap.

712
01:02:30.398 --> 01:02:32.487
I believe this
is yours. Mr. Garan.

713
01:02:58.296 --> 01:03:01.386
I am not sure we should
completely split up.

714
01:03:02.474 --> 01:03:05.085
Ren's right.
We work as a unit.

715
01:03:05.085 --> 01:03:06.565
Or else he'll pick us off
one by one.

716
01:03:06.565 --> 01:03:08.306
- Oh. bugger that.

717
01:03:13.093 --> 01:03:14.268
See ya. kids.

718
01:03:17.837 --> 01:03:18.882
Let's go.

719
01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:01.881
- Everyone still there?

720
01:04:03.448 --> 01:04:04.492
Barely.

721
01:04:13.110 --> 01:04:15.460
Let's... let's try
to find our way

722
01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:17.897
back to each other.

723
01:04:18.637 --> 01:04:19.594
Fuck!

724
01:04:25.209 --> 01:04:26.514
How do we do that?

725
01:04:27.341 --> 01:04:28.995
We don't know where we are.

726
01:04:28.995 --> 01:04:32.042
Clear out each floor.
Head down if you can.

727
01:04:32.042 --> 01:04:34.479
That is a lot of rooms.

728
01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:43.444
I wonder how long it took him
to put this rat race together.

729
01:04:43.444 --> 01:04:45.882
I'm sure he took
his sweet-ass time.

730
01:04:46.665 --> 01:04:47.753
And money.

731
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:49.842
Obviously.

732
01:04:58.895 --> 01:05:02.463
He is not going
to let us escape.

733
01:05:02.463 --> 01:05:03.769
That's the point.

734
01:06:35.339 --> 01:06:37.080
Just stay focused.

735
01:06:39.256 --> 01:06:41.301
Let's see
if we can flush him out.

736
01:06:41.301 --> 01:06:43.782
Easier said than done.

737
01:06:50.571 --> 01:06:52.660
What happened to you. Asha?

738
01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:54.401
What turned you?

739
01:06:54.401 --> 01:06:55.968
You believed in the cause.

740
01:07:07.675 --> 01:07:10.417
When greed is your God.
you can never be good enough.

741
01:07:11.331 --> 01:07:12.593
Not to beat me.

742
01:07:30.959 --> 01:07:32.222
Here we go.

743
01:07:36.965 --> 01:07:39.533
You're a really
good assassin. Asha.

744
01:07:39.533 --> 01:07:42.623
Maybe the best.
just not good enough.

745
01:07:43.711 --> 01:07:45.583
We'll see about that.

746
01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:22.140
Darkness makes you weak.

747
01:08:46.644 --> 01:08:49.907
Asha. Asha.
what's going on?

748
01:09:36.737 --> 01:09:39.653
Like I said. not good enough.

749
01:09:53.014 --> 01:09:55.843
Garan. Asha.

750
01:09:55.843 --> 01:09:56.975
She's gone.

751
01:10:12.643 --> 01:10:14.079
I'll see you again. Asha.

752
01:10:15.646 --> 01:10:16.690
Someday.

753
01:10:27.614 --> 01:10:29.790
You went down
the path of revenge

754
01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:32.010
thinking you were righteous.

755
01:10:32.010 --> 01:10:34.795
But you got lost. didn't you?

756
01:10:34.795 --> 01:10:36.754
Too many debts owed
to the wrong people.

757
01:10:36.754 --> 01:10:40.366
You spilled a lot
of innocent blood
looking for me.

758
01:10:41.715 --> 01:10:43.151
Well. here I am.

759
01:10:45.327 --> 01:10:46.590
Mr. Ren.

760
01:10:50.681 --> 01:10:51.812
Drakos-san.

761
01:10:53.987 --> 01:10:55.251
We meet at last.

762
01:10:56.252 --> 01:11:00.212
Your tricks and illusions
will not work on me.

763
01:11:01.126 --> 01:11:03.650
Oh. you have
a very keen mind.

764
01:11:03.650 --> 01:11:07.132
just like your father. Sugahiro.

765
01:11:08.264 --> 01:11:10.048
Killed by your hand.

766
01:11:14.705 --> 01:11:18.230
I don't think you understand
the true nature
of the tetsu. right?

767
01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:20.580
You and I
are very much alike.

768
01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:22.539
We are nothing alike.

769
01:11:23.366 --> 01:11:25.498
You kill for sport.

770
01:11:25.498 --> 01:11:27.500
I work for the end.

771
01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:29.154
And yet. here you are!

772
01:11:31.068 --> 01:11:34.072
Accepting my invitation...

773
01:11:34.072 --> 01:11:35.682
...for sport.

774
01:11:35.682 --> 01:11:40.644
You have dishonored
the tetsuand yourself.

775
01:11:44.125 --> 01:11:47.564
And tell me. how much
did you honor cost?

776
01:11:50.871 --> 01:11:51.829
Ren.

777
01:11:55.136 --> 01:11:56.094
Ren!

778
01:11:57.791 --> 01:11:59.402
What's going on. Ren?

779
01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:11.588
Come on!

780
01:13:25.052 --> 01:13:26.010
Wait!

781
01:13:59.782 --> 01:14:02.133
Daddy.
I'm scared. I miss Mommy.

782
01:14:03.787 --> 01:14:04.918
-  Marcus?
- Daddy!

783
01:15:15.293 --> 01:15:16.468
Ren.

784
01:15:51.764 --> 01:15:53.592
Now. that was
a hell of a chess game.

785
01:15:56.813 --> 01:15:59.076
This was never
a true chess game.

786
01:16:00.773 --> 01:16:02.601
You always
controlled the board.

787
01:16:02.601 --> 01:16:06.562
That's why you. me.
we're the last ones standing.

788
01:16:10.827 --> 01:16:13.394
You know the origin
of the word "assassin."
Mr. Garan?

789
01:16:17.224 --> 01:16:19.705
A thousand years ago.
an Arab sultan
employed hundreds of men

790
01:16:19.705 --> 01:16:21.968
to do his clandestine bidding.

791
01:16:21.968 --> 01:16:23.100
Dirty work.

792
01:16:24.188 --> 01:16:28.366
To keep 'em loyal
and to trust them.
he fed them cakes of hashish.

793
01:16:31.108 --> 01:16:33.893
He told them the euphoria
that they were feeling.
the high.

794
01:16:34.851 --> 01:16:37.114
was a little slice of heaven
that they would experience

795
01:16:37.114 --> 01:16:38.985
if they died in his service.

796
01:16:40.552 --> 01:16:42.380
They were called
the "Hashashins."

797
01:16:43.424 --> 01:16:45.818
Later. that evolved
to "assassin."

798
01:16:46.906 --> 01:16:48.603
Now. isn't that fascinating?

799
01:16:50.562 --> 01:16:52.216
I appreciate the history lesson.

800
01:17:03.227 --> 01:17:04.794
You should enjoy this moment.

801
01:17:07.013 --> 01:17:09.929
This is the last bit of euphoria
you'll ever feel.

802
01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:16.022
I knew it was gonna be you.

803
01:17:17.154 --> 01:17:19.504
I did. I always knew
you were the one

804
01:17:19.504 --> 01:17:21.419
who had the skills
to make it this far.

805
01:17:23.769 --> 01:17:24.987
I have a little confession too.

806
01:17:24.987 --> 01:17:26.684
There were a couple
of times where. uh.

807
01:17:26.684 --> 01:17:29.469
you got the assignments
and the contracts that I wanted.

808
01:17:31.037 --> 01:17:34.562
All this. all of this
'cause I beat you
out of a contract?

809
01:17:34.562 --> 01:17:37.000
No. Of course not.

810
01:17:39.002 --> 01:17:41.134
But I do have an insatiable
desire to be the best.

811
01:17:42.135 --> 01:17:43.180
Number one.

812
01:17:44.050 --> 01:17:45.922
My mother said
I was too competitive.

813
01:17:47.575 --> 01:17:51.231
But you see now. I have
the opportunity to prove
that to myself. don't I?

814
01:17:53.494 --> 01:17:54.844
I never wanted this.

815
01:17:56.019 --> 01:17:58.195
Never wanted to be
the world's best assassin.

816
01:17:59.022 --> 01:18:00.284
the King of Killers.

817
01:18:01.589 --> 01:18:02.939
What does that even mean?

818
01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:08.684
You know. it's like Asha said.

819
01:18:08.684 --> 01:18:11.817
Death is just part of life.

820
01:18:23.829 --> 01:18:24.830
So be it.

821
01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:52.597
Told you I was competitive.

822
01:19:48.478 --> 01:19:50.437
Let's talk about
your wife for a moment.

823
01:19:50.437 --> 01:19:52.091
What was she doing
there that night?

824
01:19:52.091 --> 01:19:53.701
How didn't you see her early?

825
01:19:53.701 --> 01:19:56.400
What could you
have done to save her?

826
01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:58.445
If only you hadn't hidden
all this from her.

827
01:19:58.445 --> 01:20:01.535
If you had told her the truth.
she might still be alive.

828
01:20:01.535 --> 01:20:05.670
You carry the guilt
of that night
every second of every day.

829
01:20:05.670 --> 01:20:07.628
I know what it's like
to lose someone close to you.

830
01:20:07.628 --> 01:20:10.718
someone you can never get back.
how it could tear you.

831
01:20:10.718 --> 01:20:12.546
Yet. you still come here.

832
01:20:12.546 --> 01:20:15.027
And you risk leaving
your daughter.
making her an orphan.

833
01:20:15.027 --> 01:20:17.594
Why? To try and save
the one you have left.

834
01:20:17.594 --> 01:20:19.205
But you have to kill me
to do that.

835
01:20:19.205 --> 01:20:21.904
Before I kill you!

836
01:20:58.418 --> 01:20:59.855
The King does bleed.

837
01:22:04.484 --> 01:22:06.660
- Die!

838
01:22:14.407 --> 01:22:16.192
Looks like we have a victor.

839
01:22:21.719 --> 01:22:23.677
Congratulations. Mr. Garan.

840
01:22:27.550 --> 01:22:28.594
The King of Killers.

841
01:22:30.119 --> 01:22:32.121
I believe this is yours.

842
01:22:39.389 --> 01:22:40.520
What's this?

843
01:22:42.478 --> 01:22:43.827
It's your prize.

844
01:22:46.091 --> 01:22:51.096
That card will give you
access to a bank account
in the Caymans.

845
01:22:51.096 --> 01:22:52.793
There's ten million
dollars in it.

846
01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:55.840
You take care
of your daughter.

847
01:23:03.674 --> 01:23:04.936
I need your help.

848
01:23:09.549 --> 01:23:10.811
You need my help?

849
01:23:12.204 --> 01:23:14.163
There's an international
group of assassins

850
01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:18.166
that's ubiquitous and powerful.

851
01:23:20.255 --> 01:23:21.996
They can destroy the world.

852
01:23:22.910 --> 01:23:24.608
Creation of a new world order.

853
01:23:25.957 --> 01:23:27.698
That's why I killed
all these guys.

854
01:23:31.397 --> 01:23:32.964
And what I want is a partner.

855
01:23:34.313 --> 01:23:35.793
Help me bring 'em down.

856
01:23:37.316 --> 01:23:38.665
someone better than me.

857
01:23:40.666 --> 01:23:41.668
You.

858
01:23:43.496 --> 01:23:46.630
What I want is to be
with my daughter.

859
01:23:55.334 --> 01:23:58.032
There's a helicopter
that will take you
to the airport.

860
01:24:08.695 --> 01:24:10.088
I'll be in touch.

861
01:24:38.202 --> 01:24:39.943
Isn't pizza the best?

862
01:24:39.943 --> 01:24:42.425
I know. It's really good.

863
01:24:43.208 --> 01:24:44.601
Can I have another milkshake?

864
01:24:46.081 --> 01:24:47.343
- You know what?
- What?

865
01:24:47.343 --> 01:24:48.518
I have an idea.

866
01:24:48.518 --> 01:24:50.433
- What is it?
- How about we split one?

867
01:24:50.433 --> 01:24:53.218
-  That's a great idea.
- Right?

868
01:24:53.218 --> 01:24:54.871
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

869
01:25:25.990 --> 01:25:27.339
Hey. kiddo.

870
01:25:27.339 --> 01:25:28.645
Yeah?

871
01:25:28.645 --> 01:25:30.516
Why don't you go play
your video games?

872
01:25:30.516 --> 01:25:33.215
- Okay.
- Daddy's got to talk
to someone.

873
01:25:33.215 --> 01:25:34.389
Okay. Dad.

874
01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:47.098
-  Marcus?
-  Eight p.m.
at the Coal Train.

875
01:25:47.925 --> 01:25:49.492
I loved her like a sister.

876
01:26:06.987 --> 01:26:08.511
I told you you'd see me again.

877
01:26:11.514 --> 01:26:13.342
- This can't--
- It is.

878
01:26:14.255 --> 01:26:16.432
Sorry you had to see that.
But it is real.

879
01:26:18.825 --> 01:26:20.087
Your best friend and mentor.

880
01:26:20.087 --> 01:26:21.350
that's how diabolical
these people are.

881
01:26:29.445 --> 01:26:31.621
- Where'd you get this?
- I have my sources.

882
01:26:33.318 --> 01:26:34.798
They cloned your phone.

883
01:26:34.798 --> 01:26:36.278
Sent your wife a text.

884
01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:39.716
That's what made her go
to the club that night.

885
01:26:45.156 --> 01:26:47.724
These people who recruited
your friend.

886
01:26:49.334 --> 01:26:51.293
they're the ones I told you
