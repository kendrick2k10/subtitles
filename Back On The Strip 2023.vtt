00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:08.111
<i> Magic.</i>

4
00:01:08.111 --> 00:01:09.808
<i>It has been a part
of my son's life</i>

5
00:01:09.808 --> 00:01:11.897
<i>for as long as I can remember.</i>

6
00:01:11.897 --> 00:01:15.292
<i>I swear. he just could never
get enough of that stuff.</i>

7
00:01:15.292 --> 00:01:17.729
<i>He was always setting
shit on fire.</i>

8
00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.166
<i>cutting things in half.</i>

9
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:22.604
<i>When he was ten. he had
my tired ass driving him</i>

10
00:01:22.604 --> 00:01:24.432
<i>to every novelty shop
and garage sale</i>

11
00:01:24.432 --> 00:01:26.086
<i>to find whatever
little thingamajig</i>

12
00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.392
<i>that he could use for a trick.</i>

13
00:01:28.392 --> 00:01:31.047
<i>He even had me buy him
a damn rabbit.</i>

14
00:01:31.047 --> 00:01:33.397
<i>Where I come from. we eat them.</i>

15
00:01:33.397 --> 00:01:35.747
<i>Can anyone say rabbit stew?</i>

16
00:01:35.747 --> 00:01:37.053
<i>When he was 15.</i>

17
00:01:37.053 --> 00:01:38.750
<i>he decided
to become a magician.</i>

18
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.405
<i>'Cause there's only two things
in life he's crazy about.</i>

19
00:01:41.405 --> 00:01:44.147
<i>One is magic and
the other. Robin.</i>

20
00:01:45.148 --> 00:01:47.237
Presto!

21
00:01:47.237 --> 00:01:48.543
Stop messing around. Merlin.

22
00:01:48.543 --> 00:01:50.110
I'm not messing around.
I'm stuck.

23
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.894
Can you help me out. please?
The key's beside Poof.

24
00:01:51.894 --> 00:01:53.156
Just here. over there.

25
00:01:53.156 --> 00:01:54.549
Why do trick handcuffs
need a key?

26
00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.812
Ouch! Okay. okay.
I got it. Okay.

27
00:01:56.812 --> 00:01:58.118
You better figure it out.

28
00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:00.337
You don't want to blow it
in the show.

29
00:02:01.295 --> 00:02:02.644
I'm so not ready for this.

30
00:02:02.644 --> 00:02:03.862
Don't say that.

31
00:02:03.862 --> 00:02:05.734
You've wanted this
since we were kids.

32
00:02:05.734 --> 00:02:07.518
You always said one day
you'd performed in Vegas.

33
00:02:07.518 --> 00:02:08.867
Okay. Let's see.

34
00:02:10.652 --> 00:02:12.958
Am I ready for this?

35
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.788
I guess you're right.

36
00:02:17.528 --> 00:02:19.182
This really never does lie.

37
00:02:19.704 --> 00:02:21.141
- Really?
- Yeah.

38
00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:22.054
Let me check.

39
00:02:23.404 --> 00:02:25.536
Will Robin marry Merlin one day?

40
00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:29.410
Okay. no. no. Okay. I doubt
that that will happen now

41
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.715
because you're literally
going away to college.

42
00:02:30.715 --> 00:02:33.065
Julliard is not just college.

43
00:02:33.065 --> 00:02:35.633
If I'm going to be a dancer.
it's where I need to be.

44
00:02:35.633 --> 00:02:37.244
The only time I'll see you
is what?

45
00:02:37.244 --> 00:02:38.636
Holidays and summer breaks.

46
00:02:38.636 --> 00:02:39.637
You'll forget about me.

47
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.468
You just... You just...

48
00:02:44.468 --> 00:02:46.601
You just...
You put your lips on my...

49
00:02:46.601 --> 00:02:48.080
Why'd you do that?

50
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.647
I could never forget you. Merlin.

51
00:02:50.648 --> 00:02:52.302
Now you got something good
to think about.

52
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.783
And try not to lose
that key again.

53
00:02:54.783 --> 00:02:56.219
Wait. You got...

54
00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:57.568
You got something on your...

55
00:02:57.568 --> 00:02:58.961
on your...
on your...

56
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.313
How did you do that?

57
00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:06.229
Hope you're ready. Merlin.

58
00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:07.535
Time to go.
- That's my mom! Go!

59
00:03:07.535 --> 00:03:08.927
You gotta hide.
You know how she is.

60
00:03:08.927 --> 00:03:10.277
She's crazy.

61
00:03:10.277 --> 00:03:11.930
Whatchu doing. Son?

62
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.324
Lord. I hope you ain't in there
jerking your johnson.

63
00:03:14.324 --> 00:03:15.325
No!

64
00:03:15.325 --> 00:03:16.761
Come on. We'll be late.

65
00:03:16.761 --> 00:03:18.720
We got... I don't
want to be late.

66
00:03:20.112 --> 00:03:21.244
What?

67
00:03:21.244 --> 00:03:22.811
What is that?

68
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:24.682
Robin. is that you
on your knees over there?

69
00:03:24.682 --> 00:03:25.509
Get up!

70
00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:27.903
Hi...
Yes. ma'am.

71
00:03:27.903 --> 00:03:30.732
Your little narrow ass hiding
behind the bed. What the hell?

72
00:03:30.732 --> 00:03:31.994
How did you know?

73
00:03:31.994 --> 00:03:33.561
'Cause it smells like
Now and Laters

74
00:03:33.561 --> 00:03:34.866
and ProStyle in here.

75
00:03:34.866 --> 00:03:36.172
Smell like hood rat pudding.

76
00:03:36.172 --> 00:03:38.174
I mean. we weren't doing
nothing. I swear.

77
00:03:38.174 --> 00:03:39.523
Oh. honey. I know.

78
00:03:39.523 --> 00:03:41.482
He wouldn't know what to do
with a girl anyways.

79
00:03:41.482 --> 00:03:43.092
unless she was in a catalog.

80
00:03:43.527 --> 00:03:45.268
Victoria may have its secrets.

81
00:03:45.268 --> 00:03:47.879
but Merlin. he ain't got none.

82
00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.664
- Mom!
- Now. look. we got to go.

83
00:03:49.664 --> 00:03:51.535
- Okay.
- I don't want to be late.

84
00:03:51.535 --> 00:03:53.102
Okay. Okay. I'm coming.

85
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.974
What's that she said
about jerking?

86
00:03:55.974 --> 00:03:58.107
Get your little
fresh ass out of my house!

87
00:03:58.107 --> 00:03:59.456
You gotta go.
You gotta go.

88
00:04:00.631 --> 00:04:02.503
<i> See.
everywhere Merlin went.</i>

89
00:04:02.503 --> 00:04:03.765
<i>Robin went too.</i>

90
00:04:03.765 --> 00:04:05.245
<i>They were ride or die
from day one.</i>

91
00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:07.943
<i>So when my son decided
to enter the talent show.</i>

92
00:04:07.943 --> 00:04:10.815
<i>there was no doubt who
his assistant would be.</i>

93
00:04:10.815 --> 00:04:13.514
Just try to relax. Merlin.
Nothing to worry about.

94
00:04:13.514 --> 00:04:14.993
Except the routine.

95
00:04:14.993 --> 00:04:16.821
- Routine. The routine.
- Yeah.

96
00:04:16.821 --> 00:04:18.432
The routine...
The routine!

97
00:04:18.432 --> 00:04:21.304
Oh. I forgot my extra boxers
for the endless ribbon trick.

98
00:04:21.304 --> 00:04:23.698
And that's a whole punch line.
- Okay. Wait. Wait.

99
00:04:23.698 --> 00:04:25.569
How about you just use
the ones that you have on?

100
00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:27.223
No one will be able
to tell the difference.

101
00:04:27.223 --> 00:04:28.616
- You really don't think so?
- No.

102
00:04:28.616 --> 00:04:30.574
You're all set.
And you guys are going on last

103
00:04:30.574 --> 00:04:32.228
because you had
the best audition.

104
00:04:32.228 --> 00:04:33.534
- Really?
- Yeah.

105
00:04:33.534 --> 00:04:34.578
Best audition?

106
00:04:34.578 --> 00:04:36.188
Must be talking about us. right?

107
00:04:36.188 --> 00:04:38.147
Ghetto Gangstas in da house!

108
00:04:38.147 --> 00:04:40.454
We ain't just rappers.
We gangstas!

109
00:04:40.454 --> 00:04:43.152
Alright. we about that life.
We come from the streets.

110
00:04:43.152 --> 00:04:46.198
The streets of Beverly Hills.
That's what it must be.

111
00:04:46.198 --> 00:04:48.331
Because there's no ghetto
gangsters here honestly.

112
00:04:48.331 --> 00:04:50.246
You guys are straight
out of the cul-de-sac.

113
00:04:50.246 --> 00:04:52.161
Wait a second.
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

114
00:04:52.161 --> 00:04:54.729
That's definitely Armani.
- Is that Armani?

115
00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:56.383
Yeah. my dad has the same... yes.

116
00:04:56.383 --> 00:04:57.732
Ah. y'all got tricks!

117
00:04:57.732 --> 00:04:59.690
Man. we oughta smoke
this fake-ass clown!

118
00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.172
I'm not a clown.
Okay. I'm a magician.

119
00:05:03.172 --> 00:05:05.174
And you ain't smoking nobody. honey.

120
00:05:05.174 --> 00:05:07.307
Oh. whatchu gonna do
about it. old lady?

121
00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:09.961
Pour some hot coffee on me?
Bitch. please.

122
00:05:09.961 --> 00:05:11.049
Oh!

123
00:05:11.049 --> 00:05:13.182
Oh well. since you asked nicely.

124
00:05:13.182 --> 00:05:15.358
Sit your ass down somewhere!

125
00:05:15.358 --> 00:05:17.273
Talking to me crazy like that.

126
00:05:17.273 --> 00:05:18.753
Y'all. come on. Go on.

127
00:05:18.753 --> 00:05:20.363
Look here. baby.

128
00:05:20.363 --> 00:05:22.278
You forget about them dumbasses. okay?

129
00:05:22.278 --> 00:05:25.107
You either go big
or you go home. Merlin.

130
00:05:25.107 --> 00:05:26.848
Got that?
- Yes. ma'am.

131
00:05:26.848 --> 00:05:28.415
- Go knock them out.
- I got you.

132
00:05:28.415 --> 00:05:29.590
All right.

133
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.374
Y'all thirsty?
Hmm?

134
00:05:31.374 --> 00:05:33.420
You obviously like
your coffee black.

135
00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:36.423
Behold. just an ordinary
deck of cards.

136
00:05:36.423 --> 00:05:38.512
Now. watch closely.
very intently.

137
00:05:38.512 --> 00:05:39.991
That's my baby.

138
00:05:39.991 --> 00:05:41.558
This is gonna be
the most remarkable thing

139
00:05:41.558 --> 00:05:42.994
you've ever seen
in your entire life.

140
00:05:42.994 --> 00:05:45.649
Now. I can make them turn
into something

141
00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:47.477
that's kind of big. like that.

142
00:05:48.565 --> 00:05:49.827
Whoa!

143
00:05:49.827 --> 00:05:51.568
There's no way he's gonna win.

144
00:05:52.177 --> 00:05:55.224
<i> And with Robin
by his side on that stage.</i>

145
00:05:55.224 --> 00:05:56.573
<i>he finally found his passion.</i>

146
00:05:58.053 --> 00:05:59.968
Oh! Oh my God!

147
00:06:01.143 --> 00:06:03.841
<i>I was so proud of him.
I damn near pissed myself.</i>

148
00:06:03.841 --> 00:06:06.975
<i>Okay. I did. but I had an extra
pair of panties in my purse.</i>

149
00:06:09.238 --> 00:06:13.677
<i>Anyway. he had everyone inside
that gym feeling the magic.</i>

150
00:06:13.677 --> 00:06:16.114
<i>except for a few stupid
ass haters.</i>

151
00:06:16.114 --> 00:06:21.076
For my last trick. I will be
escaping these handcuffs here

152
00:06:21.076 --> 00:06:23.252
before this candle
burns this rope

153
00:06:23.252 --> 00:06:26.603
and drops this water balloon
over my amazing assistant.

154
00:06:26.603 --> 00:06:28.649
As you guys can see.
she is a black woman

155
00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:29.954
who just got her hair done.

156
00:06:29.954 --> 00:06:31.869
So if I screw this up.
I'm screwed.

157
00:06:33.218 --> 00:06:36.657
Alrighty. let's get this show
on the road.

158
00:06:39.573 --> 00:06:41.357
And... we're lit.

159
00:06:42.271 --> 00:06:43.533
Can you guys actually help me

160
00:06:43.533 --> 00:06:44.839
get this on?
- Yeah.

161
00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:46.231
Give it up for
the Ghetto Gangsters.

162
00:06:46.231 --> 00:06:47.711
They from the streets.
They know what's going on.

163
00:06:47.711 --> 00:06:49.713
They know about some handcuffs.

164
00:06:50.584 --> 00:06:52.063
It's on there. right?
It's on there.

165
00:06:52.063 --> 00:06:52.977
Oh. it's on there.

166
00:06:52.977 --> 00:06:54.239
So I know what y'all thinking.

167
00:06:54.239 --> 00:06:56.981
These are impossible
to get out of.

168
00:06:56.981 --> 00:06:58.592
I guarantee. he ain't
getting out of that.

169
00:06:58.592 --> 00:07:03.684
But that is why they call me
the Amazing Merlin!

170
00:07:04.902 --> 00:07:08.253
And. oh. presto!

171
00:07:10.168 --> 00:07:12.301
Presto! Prest...

172
00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.651
Presto.
- Merlin!

173
00:07:14.651 --> 00:07:15.826
<i> Them fools
was so salty</i>

174
00:07:15.826 --> 00:07:17.480
<i>about losing to a magician.</i>

175
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.483
<i>they decided to let
the rabbit out of the hat.</i>

176
00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:26.707
<i>Except for my son.
it was more like a snake.</i>

177
00:07:26.707 --> 00:07:29.274
<i>It's a good thing
Robin had her blindfold on</i>

178
00:07:29.274 --> 00:07:31.799
<i>because some tricks
ain't for kids.</i>

179
00:07:31.799 --> 00:07:33.627
Oh. Lord have mercy!

180
00:07:33.627 --> 00:07:36.630
That boy is blessed!

181
00:07:37.108 --> 00:07:39.154
Merlin!
- What do you want. Robin?

182
00:07:39.154 --> 00:07:40.982
- What's going on?
- I have a situation.

183
00:07:40.982 --> 00:07:42.113
I literally have a situation.

184
00:07:42.113 --> 00:07:43.375
Y'all stop!

185
00:07:43.767 --> 00:07:45.116
Oh my God!

186
00:07:45.116 --> 00:07:47.641
That's a freak show. man.
Not a magic show.

187
00:07:47.641 --> 00:07:48.685
It's a clown.

188
00:07:48.685 --> 00:07:52.123
I told you. I am not a clown!

189
00:07:53.821 --> 00:07:56.171
Really? You need
to tell your face!

190
00:07:56.171 --> 00:07:58.042
Very funny. little girl.

191
00:07:58.042 --> 00:08:01.481
But I can assure you all.
I am not a clown.

192
00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:03.700
I'm a magician. Now watch.

193
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:04.962
You see this ball here?

194
00:08:04.962 --> 00:08:06.921
Alright. so I'm gonna put it
in this hand.

195
00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:10.707
Where'd it go?
Where did the ball go?

196
00:08:14.058 --> 00:08:15.843
Yeah. yeah. thank you!

197
00:08:16.844 --> 00:08:19.063
It's in the other hand. dummy!

198
00:08:19.063 --> 00:08:22.327
Now. shut up and
make a balloon animal.

199
00:08:24.373 --> 00:08:26.418
A orangutan basically
snuck me.

200
00:08:26.418 --> 00:08:28.290
Do you guys know about
me and orangutan?

201
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.510
No? Baby. you ever talk
about me and orangutan?

202
00:08:31.249 --> 00:08:32.381
Turn her on.

203
00:08:32.381 --> 00:08:33.991
Haha. stupid clown.

204
00:08:33.991 --> 00:08:35.253
Stupid?

205
00:08:36.211 --> 00:08:37.386
Why would you...

206
00:08:37.386 --> 00:08:38.779
So. when he get me
in the chokehold.

207
00:08:38.779 --> 00:08:40.084
I can't breathe.

208
00:08:40.084 --> 00:08:41.999
I basically took
the orangutan here. right?

209
00:08:41.999 --> 00:08:43.261
Dropped down this left leg.

210
00:08:44.698 --> 00:08:46.569
Right? I drop it down.
Took that like that.

211
00:08:47.483 --> 00:08:48.571
When I dropped to here.

212
00:08:48.571 --> 00:08:49.441
I pivoted.

213
00:08:50.051 --> 00:08:52.662
Orangutan on his back.
I showed him mercy.

214
00:08:52.662 --> 00:08:54.534
Orangutan obviously
didn't want no more.

215
00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:56.144
You guys do know I'm...
What is it?

216
00:08:56.144 --> 00:08:57.841
Second degree black belt. baby?
Second degree.

217
00:09:08.983 --> 00:09:10.462
You got to be kidding me.

218
00:09:10.462 --> 00:09:11.681
Hey. man.

219
00:09:11.681 --> 00:09:14.815
Get yo ass down!
Get down off of that. man!

220
00:09:14.815 --> 00:09:16.251
What are you doing?

221
00:09:16.251 --> 00:09:18.166
- The wig is...
- I don't want to hear it.

222
00:09:18.166 --> 00:09:20.472
Tell me. who did I hire?
'Cause you must be confused.

223
00:09:20.472 --> 00:09:22.692
Did I hire Trixie the Clown
or Dixie the Clown?

224
00:09:22.692 --> 00:09:24.520
'Cause right now you got
your dick all on display.

225
00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.130
I'm not actually a clown.
I'm a magician.

226
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.480
Okay. Let me try to find
some give a fuck.

227
00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.699
'Cause I don't care.

228
00:09:29.699 --> 00:09:31.701
I don't care what you are
or who you are.

229
00:09:31.701 --> 00:09:33.616
All this flipping and flopping

230
00:09:33.616 --> 00:09:36.053
and your goddamn elephant trunk acting.

231
00:09:36.053 --> 00:09:37.577
You can't do that here. man.

232
00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:38.969
If I wanted my daughter
to see that.

233
00:09:38.969 --> 00:09:40.188
I'll take her to the zoo.

234
00:09:40.188 --> 00:09:42.103
But instead she got
to look at this now.

235
00:09:42.103 --> 00:09:43.539
Now I turn around. she crying.

236
00:09:43.539 --> 00:09:45.236
Now you got my sweet daughter crying.

237
00:09:45.236 --> 00:09:47.151
She's actually not that sweet.

238
00:09:47.151 --> 00:09:49.110
- What? Boy...

239
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:51.765
If I take off this watch.
you gonna know it's time.

240
00:09:51.765 --> 00:09:53.549
Time to whoop your ass.
Is that what you want?

241
00:09:53.549 --> 00:09:55.551
- No. I don't...
- You want it off?

242
00:09:55.551 --> 00:09:56.900
Alright. brother.
I really apologize.

243
00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.249
But I mean.
you know how it is.

244
00:09:58.249 --> 00:09:59.686
I mean.
it's not a big deal. right?

245
00:09:59.686 --> 00:10:02.558
We all got one. Right?

246
00:10:02.558 --> 00:10:03.820
That's your shot at me?

247
00:10:04.255 --> 00:10:05.605
Hmm?

248
00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:07.171
That's a shot at me and
my personal situation?

249
00:10:07.171 --> 00:10:11.349
We don't all have one. brother.
Some of us got skipped.

250
00:10:11.349 --> 00:10:14.918
Me. my dad. Earl. Rob.

251
00:10:14.918 --> 00:10:16.180
None of us have it.

252
00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.052
If I had one. you think
I'd be in his house?

253
00:10:18.052 --> 00:10:19.880
You think I spent this type
of money on a house

254
00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.664
for my goddamn wife?
A Tesla?

255
00:10:21.664 --> 00:10:24.014
If I had a dick that big.
you think I'd have to do this?

256
00:10:24.014 --> 00:10:25.712
I'm obviously overcompensating.

257
00:10:25.712 --> 00:10:27.365
So this little thing that
you're talking about.

258
00:10:27.365 --> 00:10:28.323
that you bragging about.

259
00:10:28.323 --> 00:10:30.325
it's something that you have.

260
00:10:30.325 --> 00:10:32.936
With that being said.
you're done. You're done.

261
00:10:32.936 --> 00:10:35.112
Get your ass up out of here.
- I really need this gig.

262
00:10:35.112 --> 00:10:37.941
I said get up out of here!
Now! It's coming off.

263
00:10:38.463 --> 00:10:40.640
Get your dick dragging ass
up out of here.

264
00:10:41.379 --> 00:10:42.859
Honey. if you don't pick
your eyes up.

265
00:10:42.859 --> 00:10:44.600
I'll put them down.
God damn!

266
00:10:45.166 --> 00:10:46.297
<i> I'm done with this.</i>

267
00:10:46.297 --> 00:10:47.559
<i>Time to hang up
my bag of tricks.</i>

268
00:10:47.559 --> 00:10:49.866
What? You can't quit.

269
00:10:49.866 --> 00:10:52.260
I thought you were gonna
take the act to Vegas.

270
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.697
Does it look like
I'm ready for Vegas?

271
00:10:54.697 --> 00:10:56.090
Look at me. man.

272
00:10:57.395 --> 00:10:59.136
God. it's just time
to give up on the dream.

273
00:11:00.355 --> 00:11:02.313
Bubbles. FX. do you mind?
Like I'm serious. Okay?

274
00:11:02.313 --> 00:11:04.576
Ever since I was a kid. there's
only one thing in this world

275
00:11:04.576 --> 00:11:05.969
I love more than magic.

276
00:11:06.927 --> 00:11:08.580
And her plane is landing
right now.

277
00:11:11.192 --> 00:11:13.716
So I'm gonna go clean up

278
00:11:13.716 --> 00:11:15.370
and I'm gonna tell her
how I feel.

279
00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:17.720
Alright. Alright.

280
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.984
Ladies and gentlemen. sounds
like we got true love here.

281
00:11:20.984 --> 00:11:23.334
Alright. Alright.

282
00:11:23.334 --> 00:11:26.773
Let's get Trixie
to go see his girl!

283
00:11:28.992 --> 00:11:31.429
Go on. Pick all this stuff up.
Close the door. Let's go.

284
00:11:31.429 --> 00:11:33.562
<i> So Merlin was ready
to give up one passion</i>

285
00:11:33.562 --> 00:11:35.433
<i>to chase after another one.</i>

286
00:11:35.433 --> 00:11:37.174
<i>And after not seeing Robin
in years.</i>

287
00:11:37.174 --> 00:11:39.611
<i>he finally planned
to speak his truth.</i>

288
00:11:39.611 --> 00:11:41.309
<i>Funny thing about plans.</i>

289
00:11:41.309 --> 00:11:43.354
<i>They don't always go
as planned.</i>

290
00:11:43.354 --> 00:11:46.183
<i>Just like I never planned
on being pregnant at 23.</i>

291
00:11:46.183 --> 00:11:48.098
<i>but I'm allergic
to condoms. y'all.</i>

292
00:11:49.143 --> 00:11:50.710
Okay. I'm gonna get out.
I'm gonna change.

293
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.102
Okay. Alright. Alright.

294
00:11:52.102 --> 00:11:53.364
I'll be right back.

295
00:11:53.364 --> 00:11:54.844
I just gotta get something
out of the car.

296
00:11:54.844 --> 00:11:57.281
- Robin?
- Merlin?

297
00:11:57.281 --> 00:11:58.326
Is that you?

298
00:11:58.326 --> 00:12:00.023
Do you still believe
in magic?

299
00:12:00.676 --> 00:12:02.069
Oh my God!

300
00:12:02.069 --> 00:12:03.984
Oh my God! I was trying
to surprise you.

301
00:12:03.984 --> 00:12:05.420
but you beat me here!

302
00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:06.769
I was going to change but. yo.

303
00:12:06.769 --> 00:12:07.988
I got something big to tell you.

304
00:12:07.988 --> 00:12:10.773
Well. I have
a big surprise too.

305
00:12:10.773 --> 00:12:12.427
What's up. babe? Oh.

306
00:12:12.427 --> 00:12:13.384
Oh.

307
00:12:13.384 --> 00:12:14.864
Who's this clown?

308
00:12:15.386 --> 00:12:17.258
Don't let the clown makeup
fool you.

309
00:12:17.258 --> 00:12:19.173
I'm a serious magician.
Not a clown.

310
00:12:19.173 --> 00:12:21.305
You having trouble
over there. Trix?

311
00:12:24.221 --> 00:12:25.527
Um...

312
00:12:25.527 --> 00:12:27.877
I don't know them.
- Oh. Yeah.

313
00:12:27.877 --> 00:12:29.618
Anyways. I'm a Merlin.

314
00:12:29.618 --> 00:12:31.272
Grew up with Robin.

315
00:12:31.272 --> 00:12:33.230
She'd been my girl
since back in the day.

316
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.929
Oh. well. I'm Blaze.

317
00:12:35.929 --> 00:12:37.800
And while you were
at circus school.

318
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:42.326
Robin got a new boyfriend.
So she's kind of my girl now.

319
00:12:42.326 --> 00:12:43.980
Surprise!

320
00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.025
Hold still.

321
00:12:49.812 --> 00:12:51.640
Can I get everybody's
attention?

322
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.382
Thank you everyone so much
for coming out to see me

323
00:12:54.382 --> 00:12:55.687
and meet Blaze.

324
00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.430
Though some of you know him
already from his viral videos.

325
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:02.564
"You just got blazed!"

326
00:13:03.304 --> 00:13:05.436
And now I can finally
share the secret

327
00:13:05.436 --> 00:13:07.482
of why I've come back to LA.

328
00:13:07.482 --> 00:13:10.050
I'm a mentor dancer
on Hollywood and Grind.

329
00:13:12.487 --> 00:13:14.532
We're so excited. It's a black
Dancing with the Stars.

330
00:13:14.532 --> 00:13:16.926
And Blaze is my celebrity
dance partner.

331
00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:20.234
Please. everybody
go vote for us.

332
00:13:21.931 --> 00:13:23.933
Hi. Verna. How are you?
- Excuse me?

333
00:13:23.933 --> 00:13:25.108
- Miss Owen.
- Thank you.

334
00:13:25.108 --> 00:13:26.675
Hope you're doing great.

335
00:13:26.675 --> 00:13:29.852
You still smell like Now and
Laters and ProStyle. huh?

336
00:13:31.245 --> 00:13:32.202
Hey. girl!

337
00:13:32.855 --> 00:13:34.726
- Hey!
- Wow. he looks amazing.

338
00:13:34.726 --> 00:13:37.555
See. I told you
everyone would love him.

339
00:13:37.555 --> 00:13:39.035
You really hit the jackpot.

340
00:13:39.035 --> 00:13:43.083
First with the great job
and then the hot boyfriend.

341
00:13:43.083 --> 00:13:45.607
Yeah. all 'cause my friend
took me to her audition.

342
00:13:45.607 --> 00:13:47.174
- Yeah.
- I still can't believe this.

343
00:13:47.174 --> 00:13:48.958
Yeah. you and me both. Yeah.

344
00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:51.831
Remind me why I did that again?
It was crazy.

345
00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:53.006
You know I'm just
playing with you.

346
00:13:54.224 --> 00:13:57.967
Anyway. he's really
fine and funny.

347
00:13:57.967 --> 00:13:59.534
And making bank.

348
00:13:59.534 --> 00:14:00.883
Who wouldn't love that?

349
00:14:00.883 --> 00:14:02.232
Well...

350
00:14:03.233 --> 00:14:04.495
I can think of one person.

351
00:14:05.496 --> 00:14:07.150
That old Humpty Dumpty
over there?

352
00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:10.545
Okay. forget the nerdy neighbor
and go dance with your star.

353
00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.113
Okay. because if you don't.
I will.

354
00:14:14.244 --> 00:14:16.377
Okay. I'm gonna go talk
to Merlin.

355
00:14:16.377 --> 00:14:17.508
Yeah. Okay.

356
00:14:17.987 --> 00:14:20.250
Hey. everybody. Y'all okay?

357
00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:22.165
Hey!
- Hey!

358
00:14:22.165 --> 00:14:24.907
Oh my God.
what a wonderful surprise!

359
00:14:24.907 --> 00:14:27.649
Sorry. I didn't tell you
about the show. Merlin.

360
00:14:27.649 --> 00:14:29.781
But they wanted me
to keep it a secret.

361
00:14:29.781 --> 00:14:31.653
You know. spending all
that time with Blaze.

362
00:14:31.653 --> 00:14:33.437
rehearsing and dancing closely.

363
00:14:33.437 --> 00:14:36.484
sometimes stuff
just sort of happens.

364
00:14:36.484 --> 00:14:39.095
Yeah. I just don't get
what you see in him.

365
00:14:39.095 --> 00:14:41.141
All his jokes are put downs
and insults.

366
00:14:41.141 --> 00:14:42.794
I've seen his videos.

367
00:14:42.794 --> 00:14:44.535
- That's just an act.
- Really?

368
00:14:44.535 --> 00:14:46.407
Well. he's not that good
an actor.

369
00:14:46.973 --> 00:14:48.191
Wow.

370
00:14:49.062 --> 00:14:51.891
Alright. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that. okay?

371
00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:55.198
And I never even told you that
I was proud of you for the show.

372
00:14:55.198 --> 00:14:56.765
That's so amazing. Like...

373
00:14:56.765 --> 00:14:58.941
I couldn't imagine dancing
in front of all those folks.

374
00:14:58.941 --> 00:15:00.247
You never know.

375
00:15:00.638 --> 00:15:02.640
Yo. look who it is!

376
00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:03.815
It's the magic man.

377
00:15:03.815 --> 00:15:04.947
It's magic. He's goofy.

378
00:15:04.947 --> 00:15:07.036
Hey. Doesn't he look goofy?

379
00:15:07.036 --> 00:15:09.038
I bet you when you take the
rabbit out your hat.

380
00:15:09.038 --> 00:15:10.257
the rabbit's like.
"Put me back in!"

381
00:15:10.257 --> 00:15:11.780
- Stop. Blaze.
- I'm just clowning.

382
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.521
Nah. I'm gonna stop.
I'm not gonna clown you anymore

383
00:15:13.521 --> 00:15:15.218
because you already clowned yourself.

384
00:15:15.218 --> 00:15:16.611
Guys. look at this picture.
- Stop!

385
00:15:16.611 --> 00:15:18.482
- Do you see it?
- Stop.

386
00:15:18.482 --> 00:15:19.919
Blaze. Blaze. Stop.

387
00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:21.050
Okay.

388
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:22.965
Merlin is so much
more than that.

389
00:15:22.965 --> 00:15:24.967
What was that big news you were
gonna tell me out front?

390
00:15:24.967 --> 00:15:26.577
Yeah. yeah. drop that scoop. Brodini.

391
00:15:26.577 --> 00:15:28.188
I'm going to Vegas
for a magic gig.

392
00:15:28.579 --> 00:15:30.538
- Las Vegas?

393
00:15:30.538 --> 00:15:32.061
Merlin. that's terrific!

394
00:15:32.061 --> 00:15:34.194
Oh my God.
this is so unbelievable!

395
00:15:34.585 --> 00:15:36.065
So much to celebrate.
- Yeah.

396
00:15:36.065 --> 00:15:38.111
- Who wants to see us dance?
- Yeah. let's dance.

397
00:15:38.111 --> 00:15:39.590
Come on. let's make
some space. everybody.

398
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:41.114
You're gonna want to see this.

399
00:15:42.245 --> 00:15:44.421
<i> Now. I knew
my boy was lying.</i>

400
00:15:44.421 --> 00:15:47.816
<i>But I also knew that every lie
hides a little truth.</i>

401
00:15:50.993 --> 00:15:52.603
Why are they cheering?
Is it over?

402
00:15:52.603 --> 00:15:54.431
No. It's only just beginning.

403
00:15:54.431 --> 00:15:55.911
What are you doing?

404
00:15:56.825 --> 00:15:58.000
Oh my God.

405
00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.393
I just want to keep dancing. baby.

406
00:15:59.871 --> 00:16:03.919
So with your family watching.
all your friends watching

407
00:16:03.919 --> 00:16:05.181
and these cameras watching.

408
00:16:05.181 --> 00:16:06.661
I want to know;

409
00:16:06.661 --> 00:16:07.662
will you marry me?

410
00:16:07.662 --> 00:16:09.577
- What?
- Yeah?

411
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:13.276
Okay. Okay. yes!

412
00:16:14.016 --> 00:16:16.584
<i> And I knew the truth
was if he lost Robin.</i>

413
00:16:16.584 --> 00:16:20.414
<i>he'd have to find a way
to get the magic back.</i>

414
00:16:20.414 --> 00:16:23.286
<i>The Amazing Merlin!</i>

415
00:16:24.461 --> 00:16:25.375
<i>And presto!</i>

416
00:16:26.681 --> 00:16:28.770
Is it too late for me and Robin?

417
00:16:43.132 --> 00:16:45.047
I figured you'd be here.

418
00:16:45.526 --> 00:16:47.267
Back where it all started.

419
00:16:47.658 --> 00:16:50.139
My baby's first performance.

420
00:16:50.835 --> 00:16:52.446
I'll never forget it.

421
00:16:52.881 --> 00:16:54.752
That day didn't end well
for me.

422
00:16:55.623 --> 00:16:56.624
No.

423
00:16:57.494 --> 00:16:58.930
You got a chance to do it over.

424
00:16:59.757 --> 00:17:01.063
You know. mom. it's fine.

425
00:17:01.063 --> 00:17:04.284
Okay. don't worry about me.
It's cool.

426
00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:08.027
Boy. I'm worried about me.

427
00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:09.680
When you moving out?

428
00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.334
You 24 years old.

429
00:17:11.334 --> 00:17:14.729
I am tired of sneaking men in
late at night.

430
00:17:14.729 --> 00:17:17.210
The last one I had there
was so loud.

431
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:19.386
when I let him come
in my back door.

432
00:17:19.386 --> 00:17:20.909
I was scared he was gonna
wake you up.

433
00:17:20.909 --> 00:17:22.432
We ain't got no back door.

434
00:17:22.432 --> 00:17:23.390
Hmm!

435
00:17:26.132 --> 00:17:28.917
Anyways. it's time
for you to move on.

436
00:17:29.613 --> 00:17:31.572
Okay? Follow your dreams.

437
00:17:31.572 --> 00:17:33.487
Okay. no. I get that.
But if I leave.

438
00:17:33.487 --> 00:17:34.879
Robin will forget all about me.

439
00:17:34.879 --> 00:17:37.273
And I've always imagined us
being together.

440
00:17:37.273 --> 00:17:38.970
Boy. I always thought
me and your daddy

441
00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.060
would end up being together.
But ta-da!

442
00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.018
That didn't happen.

443
00:17:43.758 --> 00:17:44.933
Look.

444
00:17:45.716 --> 00:17:49.068
I opened up my Expedia app

445
00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:51.635
and I got you something
you needed.

446
00:17:53.681 --> 00:17:55.683
Wait. seriously?
That's...

447
00:17:55.683 --> 00:17:57.511
Mom. thanks. but it's
a one-way ticket though.

448
00:17:57.511 --> 00:17:59.687
Exactly.
'Cause there's only one way

449
00:17:59.687 --> 00:18:01.210
you're going to do this. Merlin.

450
00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:02.385
Your way.

451
00:18:02.385 --> 00:18:03.995
<i>So he made his flight</i>

452
00:18:03.995 --> 00:18:06.128
<i>and I made his room
into a rec room.</i>

453
00:18:06.128 --> 00:18:08.130
<i>'Cause Lord knows
I had a few men</i>

454
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.305
<i>I've been waiting to wreck.</i>

455
00:18:09.871 --> 00:18:13.831
<i>Meanwhile. I told Merlin to go
find Rita at the Hotel Moxie.</i>

456
00:18:13.831 --> 00:18:15.355
Hey. are you sure
this is Hotel Moxie?

457
00:18:15.355 --> 00:18:16.791
This place is supposed
to be history.

458
00:18:16.791 --> 00:18:19.141
It is. Ancient history.

459
00:18:28.846 --> 00:18:30.370
<i> Rita is my homegirl</i>

460
00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:32.372
<i>from back when I used
to work in Vegas</i>

461
00:18:32.372 --> 00:18:33.721
<i>inside The Cookie Club.</i>

462
00:18:33.721 --> 00:18:35.679
<i>The hottest spot on the strip.</i>

463
00:18:35.679 --> 00:18:38.943
<i>Sadly. it has seen better days
and so had Rita.</i>

464
00:18:38.943 --> 00:18:43.339
Only way I leave here is
with a fat check or a pine box.

465
00:18:43.339 --> 00:18:44.819
You can tell those vultures

466
00:18:44.819 --> 00:18:47.648
they can kiss
Rita's big white juicy ass.

467
00:18:57.397 --> 00:18:59.312
For my glaucoma.

468
00:19:00.182 --> 00:19:02.010
Welcome to the Vagrant Inn.
Las Vegas.

469
00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:03.185
How many nights you need?

470
00:19:03.968 --> 00:19:05.579
You know.
I'm actually not sure

471
00:19:05.579 --> 00:19:06.710
how long I'll be here.

472
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:08.886
Well. that makes
two of us. honey.

473
00:19:09.496 --> 00:19:11.628
Well. I'm Jason Owens.

474
00:19:11.628 --> 00:19:13.717
but everybody
just calls me Merlin.

475
00:19:15.676 --> 00:19:16.894
I'm Verna's son.

476
00:19:16.894 --> 00:19:18.635
I guess she used
to work for you years ago.

477
00:19:18.635 --> 00:19:20.463
I'll be damned!

478
00:19:20.463 --> 00:19:24.119
She was one terrific lady
and a great waitress.

479
00:19:24.119 --> 00:19:25.990
She stood by me through
some tough times

480
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.904
after my daddy passed.

481
00:19:28.036 --> 00:19:30.995
If you are Verna's child.

482
00:19:30.995 --> 00:19:32.867
I got a room for you

483
00:19:32.867 --> 00:19:34.608
and it overlooks the pool.

484
00:19:35.478 --> 00:19:36.784
It ain't much to look at now.

485
00:19:36.784 --> 00:19:38.568
but once upon a time.
it sure was something.

486
00:19:38.568 --> 00:19:40.048
This was my daddy's pride
and joy

487
00:19:40.048 --> 00:19:41.963
and I ran it
for a good 28 years.

488
00:19:41.963 --> 00:19:45.053
Billionaire owners are trying
to just take Rita's ass

489
00:19:45.053 --> 00:19:46.402
for less to nothing.

490
00:19:46.402 --> 00:19:48.187
Motherfucker bloodsuckers.

491
00:19:48.709 --> 00:19:50.754
But we do have happy hour
every day at six

492
00:19:50.754 --> 00:19:52.452
in the Cookie Club out back.

493
00:19:56.238 --> 00:19:57.935
It's not called
the Hotel Moxie anymore.

494
00:19:57.935 --> 00:20:00.808
It's called The Vagina?

495
00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:02.375
Wait. that's...

496
00:20:02.375 --> 00:20:03.767
<i> That sounds cozy.</i>

497
00:20:03.767 --> 00:20:05.856
Is it moist in there?

498
00:20:05.856 --> 00:20:07.249
Okay. Mama. don't.

499
00:20:07.249 --> 00:20:08.816
Are the people there nice.

500
00:20:08.816 --> 00:20:10.426
or is it mostly dicks?

501
00:20:10.426 --> 00:20:11.906
<i>You tell me.</i>

502
00:20:11.906 --> 00:20:13.429
Does it smell funny in there?

503
00:20:13.429 --> 00:20:14.909
<i>Mom! Really?</i>

504
00:20:14.909 --> 00:20:16.824
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. baby.

505
00:20:16.824 --> 00:20:18.217
That was a little too much.

506
00:20:18.217 --> 00:20:19.522
Yeah. whatever. I mean.

507
00:20:19.522 --> 00:20:20.697
I got some auditions tomorrow.

508
00:20:20.697 --> 00:20:22.264
which is kind of cool.

509
00:20:22.264 --> 00:20:25.267
but I don't know.
I feel like I'm wasting my time.

510
00:20:25.267 --> 00:20:27.704
<i>Boy. you been wanting this
since you was in diapers.</i>

511
00:20:27.704 --> 00:20:30.098
watching Merlin the Magician cartoons.

512
00:20:30.098 --> 00:20:32.318
Now I know you was
full of shit then.

513
00:20:32.318 --> 00:20:35.408
You have to ask yourself;
are you full of shit now?

514
00:20:35.408 --> 00:20:36.539
You right.

515
00:20:37.497 --> 00:20:39.150
It's now or never.

516
00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:42.328
Now. never call me with
this bullshit again.

517
00:20:43.546 --> 00:20:45.548
You ready for round two?
- Uhn-uhn! Uhn-uhn!

518
00:20:45.548 --> 00:20:47.507
Oh. no. you ready
for round two.

519
00:20:47.507 --> 00:20:50.771
Stop crying! Stop crying!
Shut up.

520
00:20:52.816 --> 00:20:55.689
This is my first audition.
I'm really excited.

521
00:20:59.258 --> 00:21:00.824
Just get right into it then.

522
00:21:08.049 --> 00:21:09.833
<i> So Merlin took
his first step</i>

523
00:21:09.833 --> 00:21:12.967
<i>to becoming a real
Las Vegas magician.</i>

524
00:21:12.967 --> 00:21:15.491
<i>Unfortunately.
his first audition</i>

525
00:21:15.491 --> 00:21:17.319
<i>kind of was like
the first time I had sex.</i>

526
00:21:17.319 --> 00:21:18.538
<i>Y'all know what I mean.</i>

527
00:21:18.538 --> 00:21:21.454
<i>Awkward. messy.
a little painful.</i>

528
00:21:21.454 --> 00:21:24.892
<i>And for some reason.
there was glitter in my ass.</i>

529
00:21:24.892 --> 00:21:26.589
<i>But I digress.</i>

530
00:21:30.724 --> 00:21:32.856
<i>And just like bad sex.</i>

531
00:21:32.856 --> 00:21:36.164
<i>the only way to get good at it
is to keep trying</i>

532
00:21:36.164 --> 00:21:38.297
<i>and trying and trying.</i>

533
00:21:38.993 --> 00:21:42.344
<i>And Merlin. well.
he wasn't ready to give up yet.</i>

534
00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:51.571
No. no! Shit!

535
00:21:52.441 --> 00:21:54.008
Jesus.

536
00:22:01.624 --> 00:22:03.452
Oh...

537
00:22:03.452 --> 00:22:05.062
It's for my arthritis.

538
00:22:05.062 --> 00:22:06.890
- Don't you mean glaucoma?

539
00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:08.239
What. are you my doctor now?

540
00:22:08.239 --> 00:22:09.502
No. but...

541
00:22:09.502 --> 00:22:11.242
You're a little early
for happy hour.

542
00:22:11.242 --> 00:22:13.375
Yeah. well. I just bombed
my audition.

543
00:22:13.375 --> 00:22:16.247
so it's gonna take a lot longer
than an hour to get me happy.

544
00:22:16.247 --> 00:22:17.771
Yeah. well. you ain't
the only one unhappy.

545
00:22:17.771 --> 00:22:19.468
Look at this.
It's my busiest night

546
00:22:19.468 --> 00:22:21.644
and this damn karaoke machine
broke down.

547
00:22:22.079 --> 00:22:23.429
Can I get you anything?

548
00:22:24.212 --> 00:22:26.867
Yeah. Uh. what's the hardest
stuff you got?

549
00:22:26.867 --> 00:22:28.738
My private stash.

550
00:22:28.738 --> 00:22:31.393
I get it from the local Paiutes.
It's straight firewater.

551
00:22:31.393 --> 00:22:34.048
- Okay.
- You ain't ready for that.

552
00:22:34.048 --> 00:22:36.355
But we do have some
Crown Royal apple.

553
00:22:36.355 --> 00:22:37.399
How about that?

554
00:22:37.399 --> 00:22:39.270
- Crown Royal apple.
- Oh. yeah.

555
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:41.490
Miss Rita. I am kind
of tight for money.

556
00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:43.666
So you know.
I got a deck of cards.

557
00:22:43.666 --> 00:22:45.799
so how about you draw for it?

558
00:22:45.799 --> 00:22:47.888
But if you win. I owe you.

559
00:22:47.888 --> 00:22:50.412
But if I win. you owe me.

560
00:22:50.412 --> 00:22:52.936
So pick a card. Miss Rita.

561
00:22:54.416 --> 00:22:56.418
- This is so dumb.
- Hmm!

562
00:22:56.418 --> 00:22:57.985
That's a good card.
I know it is.

563
00:22:57.985 --> 00:23:00.204
I know it is a good card.
Oh. I can't look at it.

564
00:23:00.204 --> 00:23:02.076
I can't look at it.
- No. you cannot look it.

565
00:23:02.076 --> 00:23:04.034
Go ahead. Put that thing back
in the deck. Anywhere.

566
00:23:04.034 --> 00:23:05.427
That is beautiful. Miss Rita.

567
00:23:06.428 --> 00:23:07.908
That's so good. Miss Rita.

568
00:23:07.908 --> 00:23:09.344
That's so lovely.

569
00:23:09.344 --> 00:23:11.346
Okay.
- Testing. Testing.

570
00:23:11.346 --> 00:23:12.869
Was this your card?

571
00:23:12.869 --> 00:23:15.394
This had to be your card. right?
- No. it's not my card.

572
00:23:16.743 --> 00:23:18.440
All right. um...

573
00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.920
Was that your card?
This had to have been.

574
00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.139
No. I don't have time
for this.

575
00:23:22.139 --> 00:23:24.185
I have a whole group
of single ladies coming in.

576
00:23:24.185 --> 00:23:25.534
It's their busiest night
in town.

577
00:23:25.534 --> 00:23:28.624
And with no karaoke to keep
them eating my wings

578
00:23:28.624 --> 00:23:30.452
and drinking my liquor...
- Yeah.

579
00:23:30.452 --> 00:23:32.149
...what am I gonna do
for entertainment?

580
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:34.456
Will you stop playing?
I need to make some dough. kid.

581
00:23:34.456 --> 00:23:36.763
Have any ideas? What?

582
00:23:36.763 --> 00:23:38.460
Jesus. what is that?

583
00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:41.202
That's your card. right?
That's your card. right?

584
00:23:42.899 --> 00:23:44.640
Wow.

585
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.642
<i>These ladies ain't
the magic show type.</i>

586
00:23:46.642 --> 00:23:48.992
But if you keep the bar flowing.
I'll pay you 50 bucks.

587
00:23:48.992 --> 00:23:51.473
Cool. This is a nice place
you got here.

588
00:23:51.473 --> 00:23:54.694
Nice place?
The Cookie Club was famous.

589
00:23:54.694 --> 00:23:57.653
We used to pack the house.
Believe it. Once upon a time.

590
00:23:57.653 --> 00:24:00.221
we had the finest male
dancing troupe in town.

591
00:24:00.221 --> 00:24:01.527
The Chocolate Chips.

592
00:24:01.527 --> 00:24:04.225
Look. Mr. Face. Mr. Body.

593
00:24:04.225 --> 00:24:06.749
Mr. Slim Sexy. Dr. X.

594
00:24:06.749 --> 00:24:09.360
And the one and only Mr. Big.

595
00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.884
It was a goddamn goldmine.

596
00:24:10.884 --> 00:24:12.581
So what happened?
Why'd it stop?

597
00:24:12.581 --> 00:24:16.324
Egos. Too much success.
They argued all the time.

598
00:24:16.324 --> 00:24:17.717
And then they just split up.

599
00:24:17.717 --> 00:24:19.414
They talked about
going back together.

600
00:24:19.414 --> 00:24:21.329
but Mr. Big suffered
a big depression

601
00:24:21.329 --> 00:24:24.593
and crashed his car.
almost lost his leg.

602
00:24:24.593 --> 00:24:27.161
The Cookie Club was over
just like that.

603
00:24:27.161 --> 00:24:30.773
We lost our biggest draw.
And when I say big I mean big.

604
00:24:30.773 --> 00:24:32.601
Now why don't you just go
get ready?

605
00:24:32.601 --> 00:24:34.516
You got a tough crowd
waiting for you.

606
00:24:34.516 --> 00:24:36.344
Miss Rita. you talking
about the lonely bunch

607
00:24:36.344 --> 00:24:38.259
of happy hour ladies?

608
00:24:38.259 --> 00:24:39.521
They do not scare me.

609
00:24:39.521 --> 00:24:42.481
Bet you didn't expect flowers!

610
00:24:42.481 --> 00:24:44.700
<i> Now my baby
was fearless for sure.</i>

611
00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:46.833
<i>but sometimes. fear is good.</i>

612
00:24:46.833 --> 00:24:49.618
<i>There are things
you should be afraid of.</i>

613
00:24:49.618 --> 00:24:51.446
Give him a chance.

614
00:24:51.446 --> 00:24:54.144
This guy sucks!
We want karaoke!

615
00:24:54.884 --> 00:24:56.451
- You want karaoke?
- Yeah.

616
00:24:56.451 --> 00:24:58.497
You want karaoke? Well. have
y'all heard of that one song

617
00:24:58.497 --> 00:25:00.237
about the guy who liked
chicken wings with two thumbs

618
00:25:00.237 --> 00:25:02.936
because you know who wrote that?
- No.

619
00:25:02.936 --> 00:25:05.286
Who wrote it? It was me!
I wrote it 'cause it's me.

620
00:25:06.766 --> 00:25:09.464
<i> Like doing magic
for some thirsty hoes</i>

621
00:25:09.464 --> 00:25:12.380
<i>who'd rather be getting drunk
or getting laid.</i>

622
00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:14.382
You real feisty. Now you been
giving me problems all night.

623
00:25:14.382 --> 00:25:16.123
What you sipping on?
'Cause I'm trying to get loose.

624
00:25:16.123 --> 00:25:18.038
Oh. I'm drinking
on that firewater. baby.

625
00:25:18.038 --> 00:25:20.170
- Oh. that firewater?
- Yeah.

626
00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:21.563
Firewater? She's sipping
on that firewater.

627
00:25:21.563 --> 00:25:23.434
Y'all want to see some
entertainment. right?

628
00:25:23.434 --> 00:25:25.480
Give me some firewater.
Jesus Christ

629
00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.830
Y'all want to see some
entertainment? Y'all want it?

630
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:29.310
We're gonna get some
entertainment in the house!

631
00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:31.486
We're gonna get some
entertainment! Okay?

632
00:25:31.486 --> 00:25:33.053
This is a disaster.

633
00:25:33.053 --> 00:25:34.533
Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm!

634
00:25:34.533 --> 00:25:38.145
<i> Or like trying
his fire-breathing trick</i>

635
00:25:38.145 --> 00:25:40.582
<i>for the first time
in front of the Cookie Club's</i>

636
00:25:40.582 --> 00:25:42.584
<i>biggest star of all time.</i>

637
00:25:43.585 --> 00:25:46.370
<i>Luther "Mr. Big" Ellis.</i>
- Goddamn.

638
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:47.676
Oh. my god!

639
00:25:47.676 --> 00:25:49.199
Oh. my god. no!

640
00:25:50.636 --> 00:25:52.289
I don't know how to...

641
00:25:53.334 --> 00:25:55.075
It's on my shirt too!

642
00:25:55.989 --> 00:25:58.557
It's on my leg! It's on my leg!

643
00:25:58.861 --> 00:26:01.429
Oh. wait! Wait! Yes!

644
00:26:04.258 --> 00:26:06.565
- Um...
- Shake that magic rod. yes!

645
00:26:09.002 --> 00:26:10.569
That's my kind of trick!

646
00:26:10.569 --> 00:26:11.918
Oh!

647
00:26:12.745 --> 00:26:14.094
Good Lord.

648
00:26:14.094 --> 00:26:17.010
Luther. are you seeing
what I'm seeing?

649
00:26:17.837 --> 00:26:19.012
We back in business.

650
00:26:20.927 --> 00:26:22.406
Man!

651
00:26:27.586 --> 00:26:29.500
Hello?
<i> Hey. Merlin.</i>

652
00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.328
Robin. Oh. hey. Robin!

653
00:26:31.328 --> 00:26:32.852
You left without saying
goodbye the other day.

654
00:26:32.852 --> 00:26:33.722
Is everything okay with you?

655
00:26:33.722 --> 00:26:35.768
Yeah. yeah. it's amazing.

656
00:26:35.768 --> 00:26:37.378
It's great. It's great.

657
00:26:37.378 --> 00:26:39.598
In fact. I just had
my first Vegas gig

658
00:26:39.598 --> 00:26:42.122
<i>and I got a standing ovation.</i>

659
00:26:42.122 --> 00:26:44.037
Wow! Sounds like it
was a hot show!

660
00:26:44.037 --> 00:26:48.694
Yep. it was fire. but not
as surprising as the party was.

661
00:26:48.694 --> 00:26:53.481
Yeah. I had no idea
he was going to propose.

662
00:26:54.047 --> 00:26:55.918
Yeah. um...

663
00:26:55.918 --> 00:26:58.791
I guess you and Blaze
will be dancing together

664
00:26:58.791 --> 00:26:59.966
for a long time.

665
00:27:01.707 --> 00:27:02.969
Yeah.

666
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:10.367
Merlin. there's someone
out here I want you to meet.

667
00:27:10.367 --> 00:27:11.760
I actually got to go.

668
00:27:12.674 --> 00:27:13.980
Me too.

669
00:27:17.636 --> 00:27:18.637
Bye.

670
00:27:23.424 --> 00:27:25.165
Wait. so you want me
to be a stripper?

671
00:27:25.165 --> 00:27:28.168
A stripper? No. a Chip.

672
00:27:28.168 --> 00:27:29.996
But I can't dance.
I'm a magician.

673
00:27:29.996 --> 00:27:32.694
Can't. can't. can't.
Ain't no can't in Vegas.

674
00:27:32.694 --> 00:27:35.566
Boy. Vegas. you got to be
whatever you got to be
to survive.

675
00:27:35.566 --> 00:27:37.786
Them women gave you more tips
than you ever made

676
00:27:37.786 --> 00:27:39.614
doing all of
that magic bullshit.

677
00:27:39.614 --> 00:27:43.009
That's right. And after
you jiggled your jewels tonight.

678
00:27:43.009 --> 00:27:46.186
those horny bitches ran out
my highest bar tab in weeks.

679
00:27:46.186 --> 00:27:48.710
You see? Everybody wins.

680
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:51.060
Rita gets to pay her bills

681
00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:54.150
and you get more cash
for your stash.

682
00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:58.807
Okay. so you want me
to go out there alone

683
00:27:58.807 --> 00:28:02.028
and shake my ass for money
every night?

684
00:28:02.028 --> 00:28:03.769
Of course not.

685
00:28:03.769 --> 00:28:05.248
You've got Sundays off.

686
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:09.949
Boy. you ain't gonna be alone.

687
00:28:09.949 --> 00:28:11.646
So. what. you gonna hire
more dancers?

688
00:28:11.646 --> 00:28:13.866
Fuck no. we ain't got
no money for that.

689
00:28:13.866 --> 00:28:17.391
No. you and The Chips.

690
00:28:17.391 --> 00:28:20.655
The Chips? You haven't talked
to The Chips in years.

691
00:28:21.525 --> 00:28:22.744
How are you going to find them?

692
00:28:24.137 --> 00:28:26.313
<i> So my son left LA
looking for magic.</i>

693
00:28:26.313 --> 00:28:29.011
<i>but now the one and only
Mr. Big</i>

694
00:28:29.011 --> 00:28:31.274
<i>was about to teach him
some new tricks.</i>

695
00:28:31.274 --> 00:28:32.493
God dang. man.

696
00:28:32.493 --> 00:28:34.103
I just hope you got AC
up in this place.

697
00:28:34.103 --> 00:28:35.757
I'm sweating my balls off
out here in this heat.

698
00:28:35.757 --> 00:28:38.455
Ain't no hotter than
you lighting your ass on fire.

699
00:28:38.455 --> 00:28:40.153
You're lucky
you still got balls.

700
00:28:40.153 --> 00:28:41.241
- Yeah.

701
00:28:41.763 --> 00:28:44.157
How a young kid like you
get into magic anyway?

702
00:28:44.157 --> 00:28:46.289
My mom let me try a bunch
of different things

703
00:28:46.289 --> 00:28:48.161
and magic was just
the best path for me.

704
00:28:49.684 --> 00:28:51.991
Well. every path has a detour.
Thank God.

705
00:28:51.991 --> 00:28:54.167
Yeah. no kidding.

706
00:28:54.167 --> 00:28:56.647
I mean. I'm already lying
to Robin about my magic working.

707
00:28:56.647 --> 00:28:59.041
Now I gotta fool her about me
being a stripper too.

708
00:28:59.041 --> 00:29:00.173
Who is that. Robin?

709
00:29:00.173 --> 00:29:01.261
Robin. who is that.
your girlfriend?

710
00:29:01.261 --> 00:29:05.091
No. she's...
she's a girl. and...

711
00:29:05.091 --> 00:29:08.094
Okay. well. she's a girl
and she's like a friend.

712
00:29:08.094 --> 00:29:10.618
She would be my girlfriend too.

713
00:29:10.618 --> 00:29:12.751
but she's got this
stupid fiancé so I'm...

714
00:29:12.751 --> 00:29:15.275
- Oh. she got a fiancé?
- Yeah.

715
00:29:15.275 --> 00:29:17.799
- Your girl got a fiancé?
- Hm-hmm.

716
00:29:17.799 --> 00:29:19.845
Well. it seems to me the only
person that you're fooling

717
00:29:19.845 --> 00:29:20.759
is yourself.

718
00:29:22.021 --> 00:29:23.892
- Whatever. man.

719
00:29:23.892 --> 00:29:26.068
Glad you got a big ding-ding. boy.

720
00:29:30.986 --> 00:29:31.987
All right.

721
00:29:33.902 --> 00:29:34.816
Yeah.

722
00:29:35.643 --> 00:29:38.341
Des. Look at that body.
Still in shape!

723
00:29:41.562 --> 00:29:44.521
Baby. I need...
No. two more 255 on seven!

724
00:29:44.521 --> 00:29:48.787
Oh. so. I guess the shape
you meant was round.

725
00:29:48.787 --> 00:29:50.049
Des?

726
00:29:52.312 --> 00:29:55.968
Luther Ellis? Oh. man!

727
00:29:55.968 --> 00:29:58.013
It's been like 20 years. baby!

728
00:29:58.013 --> 00:29:59.972
You still look good.
look at you!

729
00:29:59.972 --> 00:30:01.364
You sure as hell don't!

730
00:30:01.364 --> 00:30:02.888
Oh. I gained a little weight.

731
00:30:02.888 --> 00:30:04.628
I mean. look. just a smidge.

732
00:30:04.628 --> 00:30:06.500
- Des!
- What. baby?

733
00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:08.154
This is good living. baby.

734
00:30:08.154 --> 00:30:09.808
And the shirt's too small.

735
00:30:09.808 --> 00:30:11.287
Who's your compadre right here?

736
00:30:11.287 --> 00:30:13.724
- I'm Merlin.
- Did you say breakfast?

737
00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:15.291
Who said pancakes?

738
00:30:15.814 --> 00:30:17.467
Well. shit. let's go.
Let me wash up.

739
00:30:17.467 --> 00:30:18.860
Shit. you're looking good. baby!

740
00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:22.646
Grits. you a grits guy.
I know you like grits.

741
00:30:23.038 --> 00:30:25.475
So. you thinking about putting
the band back together. huh?

742
00:30:25.475 --> 00:30:28.000
Do you think he'd be here
if he wasn't?

743
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.784
Who the fuck is you?

744
00:30:30.741 --> 00:30:32.439
And are you eating
this right here?

745
00:30:33.092 --> 00:30:34.223
Nah.

746
00:30:34.223 --> 00:30:35.311
What about your leg?

747
00:30:35.311 --> 00:30:37.400
My dancing days
is over. buddy.

748
00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.446
But I got a ringer.

749
00:30:39.446 --> 00:30:41.883
So. Luther done found himself
a new Mr. Big. huh?

750
00:30:41.883 --> 00:30:43.798
Yeah. yeah. I guess.

751
00:30:43.798 --> 00:30:46.409
Oh. the boy's talented.
So talented.

752
00:30:46.409 --> 00:30:49.543
Well. we had fun back then. man.

753
00:30:49.543 --> 00:30:50.892
Didn't we?

754
00:30:50.892 --> 00:30:52.894
I don't think that group
would work out now.

755
00:30:52.894 --> 00:30:55.201
It ain't the group
that needs to work out. Des.

756
00:30:55.201 --> 00:30:57.159
Listen. I'm still
the same body

757
00:30:57.159 --> 00:30:58.857
underneath all of this. baby.

758
00:30:58.857 --> 00:31:01.076
Well. stop acting like
you don't miss it.

759
00:31:01.076 --> 00:31:03.557
I mean. the women. the cheers.

760
00:31:04.166 --> 00:31:06.168
The tips! The tips?

761
00:31:06.168 --> 00:31:10.216
I do. But look. business
is booming. baby.

762
00:31:10.216 --> 00:31:12.087
Did you know that Pahrump.

763
00:31:12.087 --> 00:31:14.176
the place you in right now. Pahrump.

764
00:31:14.176 --> 00:31:17.484
is the number one city
to kill yourself?

765
00:31:17.484 --> 00:31:18.702
Get me out of here. man.

766
00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:21.140
I'm so God damned bored.

767
00:31:22.097 --> 00:31:23.664
I got you.

768
00:31:23.664 --> 00:31:25.884
Where's the party?
Where's the party?

769
00:31:25.884 --> 00:31:27.842
Where's the party at. uh!

770
00:31:27.842 --> 00:31:29.757
That's right!

771
00:31:29.757 --> 00:31:31.541
- I'm in.
- All right. Good.

772
00:31:31.541 --> 00:31:33.413
You know where to find
the rest of the guys?

773
00:31:33.413 --> 00:31:35.545
Hell no. especially
that crotch-stuffing.

774
00:31:35.545 --> 00:31:37.156
no-talking Dr. X.

775
00:31:37.156 --> 00:31:39.593
And you know I don't talk
to Slim!

776
00:31:39.593 --> 00:31:41.029
After he took my girl.

777
00:31:41.638 --> 00:31:42.944
Get over it. baby!

778
00:31:42.944 --> 00:31:44.424
Well. I might have
Face's number.

779
00:31:44.424 --> 00:31:45.686
He came here last year
wanting me

780
00:31:45.686 --> 00:31:47.644
to customize his car
for his girls.

781
00:31:47.644 --> 00:31:51.474
My man Tyriq. huh?
Still pampering the ladies?

782
00:31:52.345 --> 00:31:53.824
He's pampering. all right.

783
00:31:53.824 --> 00:31:55.087
Quadruplets?

784
00:31:56.392 --> 00:31:57.741
Brother!

785
00:31:57.741 --> 00:31:59.743
A lot has changed since
the last time I saw you

786
00:31:59.743 --> 00:32:02.877
with four girls in one bed.
but this right here?

787
00:32:02.877 --> 00:32:05.445
I never pictured you
settling down.

788
00:32:05.445 --> 00:32:07.664
- Does it look like I settled?
- No!

789
00:32:07.664 --> 00:32:09.318
He got you there. Luther.

790
00:32:09.318 --> 00:32:11.277
I mean. yo.
your home is beautiful.

791
00:32:11.277 --> 00:32:13.627
- It's not mine. it's my lady's.

792
00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:17.152
When the Chips closed. I applied
for every type of job.

793
00:32:17.152 --> 00:32:18.327
I got nothing.

794
00:32:18.327 --> 00:32:19.720
So. I went back to stripping.

795
00:32:20.416 --> 00:32:22.941
I actually did a party here
for this rich chick.

796
00:32:22.941 --> 00:32:24.899
Next thing I know.
spent the night.

797
00:32:24.899 --> 00:32:27.641
she said I could spend
another day. a week.

798
00:32:27.641 --> 00:32:29.773
a month. a year.

799
00:32:29.773 --> 00:32:31.775
Then she just woke up
one morning and she said.

800
00:32:31.775 --> 00:32:34.691
"You can stay here as long
as you want if we have a baby."

801
00:32:35.083 --> 00:32:37.694
And we started using
fertility drugs

802
00:32:37.694 --> 00:32:40.610
and. as you can see. it worked!
- No shit!

803
00:32:41.916 --> 00:32:43.918
So. you finally
got them to sleep?

804
00:32:46.181 --> 00:32:49.576
Oh. that's a nice pic of you
and your girls. man.

805
00:32:49.576 --> 00:32:51.056
Check you out. flexing the guns!

806
00:32:51.056 --> 00:32:52.971
Those are not mine.
those are my lady's.

807
00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:55.886
She's a top ranked
mixed martial arts fighter.

808
00:32:55.886 --> 00:32:57.149
While she's out there
kicking ass.

809
00:32:57.149 --> 00:32:59.281
I'm stuck up in here wiping ass.

810
00:32:59.281 --> 00:33:02.458
Damn. Face.
your girl is jacked!

811
00:33:02.458 --> 00:33:04.330
Two-time champ.

812
00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:06.593
and she'd put me
in a four-legged oomoplata

813
00:33:06.593 --> 00:33:09.248
if she knew I was two-timing her
with the Chips.

814
00:33:09.248 --> 00:33:11.772
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
You ain't cheating. now.

815
00:33:11.772 --> 00:33:12.642
You dancing.

816
00:33:14.035 --> 00:33:16.690
And it looks like she spends
a lot of time out of town. right?

817
00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:18.126
True.

818
00:33:18.126 --> 00:33:20.172
Well. how she going to know?

819
00:33:20.868 --> 00:33:23.436
You think you guys could hook
me up with some daycare
or something?

820
00:33:23.436 --> 00:33:26.178
- Brother!
- Oh. baby. come on!

821
00:33:28.136 --> 00:33:30.399
- Don't wake up the babies.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

822
00:33:30.399 --> 00:33:31.226
I'm sorry.

823
00:33:31.226 --> 00:33:32.662
Look. do you got any idea

824
00:33:32.662 --> 00:33:34.664
how the hell we could find
the rest of the guys?

825
00:33:34.664 --> 00:33:36.231
Dr. X is a mystery to me.

826
00:33:36.231 --> 00:33:38.190
I don't know what happened
to his flat ass.

827
00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:40.148
But I do know how
you can get to Slim.

828
00:33:40.148 --> 00:33:42.498
And he's a long way from hell.

829
00:33:49.418 --> 00:33:53.640
I see today we got
a lot of empty pews

830
00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:57.078
in this church of God.

831
00:33:57.078 --> 00:33:59.211
Oh. you've got
to be shitting me.

832
00:33:59.211 --> 00:34:03.084
Because people spent the night
partying in the club.

833
00:34:03.084 --> 00:34:05.521
I see a few people
missing right now!

834
00:34:05.521 --> 00:34:08.524
Where is Joseph?
Where is Corinne?

835
00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.049
I don't see Bernadette.

836
00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:14.313
Where's Jimmy? Jimmy!

837
00:34:16.358 --> 00:34:19.666
But couldn't find it
in their will or in their soul

838
00:34:19.666 --> 00:34:21.363
or in their presence

839
00:34:21.363 --> 00:34:24.627
to get up and make their way
to church

840
00:34:24.627 --> 00:34:26.716
to praise the Lord.

841
00:34:26.716 --> 00:34:29.067
Man. I thought you said
he was the sexy one.

842
00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:32.026
That ain't the Slim
I used to know.

843
00:34:32.853 --> 00:34:34.507
Church ain't popping!

844
00:34:34.507 --> 00:34:37.336
You mean to tell me
the Lord ain't popping?

845
00:34:37.814 --> 00:34:39.773
You think church can't turn up?

846
00:34:39.773 --> 00:34:43.342
Well. they say the Lord
will help you find the way...

847
00:34:44.473 --> 00:34:46.171
...but you got to meet
the Lord halfway.

848
00:34:47.694 --> 00:34:49.957
Can I get an amen?
- Amen!

849
00:34:51.437 --> 00:34:53.395
What's happening
in them clubs?

850
00:34:53.395 --> 00:34:55.354
You know what they doing
in the club?

851
00:34:55.354 --> 00:34:57.095
Bumping and grinding
all over each other!

852
00:34:57.095 --> 00:35:00.010
They're in that club last night.
Oh!

853
00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:02.665
They're shaking. they bumping

854
00:35:02.665 --> 00:35:04.537
and they grinding
all over each other.

855
00:35:04.537 --> 00:35:07.714
Hey. what's going on in here?
This ain't for us!

856
00:35:07.714 --> 00:35:10.108
They teabagging!
They teabagging!

857
00:35:10.108 --> 00:35:13.502
You don't get no tea.
The Lord ain't in them!

858
00:35:13.502 --> 00:35:15.765
Boom. bang. boom.
pow. boom. pow!

859
00:35:15.765 --> 00:35:17.550
Do the washing machine!

860
00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:19.160
Damn. he's still got it!

861
00:35:24.209 --> 00:35:26.428
Bumping and grinding.
bumping and grinding.

862
00:35:26.428 --> 00:35:28.126
bumping and grinding
all over each other!

863
00:35:30.128 --> 00:35:32.260
So. you fools are really
thinking about

864
00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:34.175
putting the Chips back together?

865
00:35:34.175 --> 00:35:35.829
Oh!
- Here you go. dear.

866
00:35:36.699 --> 00:35:38.048
Thank you. sweetie.

867
00:35:39.049 --> 00:35:41.400
It's so nice to see you all.

868
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.402
Have a blessed day.

869
00:35:43.402 --> 00:35:44.794
Thank you. sweetie.

870
00:35:48.189 --> 00:35:50.365
Are you out of
your God damn mind?

871
00:35:50.365 --> 00:35:51.801
Excuse me. Lord.

872
00:35:51.801 --> 00:35:54.195
But that's got to be
the stupidest motherfucking idea

873
00:35:54.195 --> 00:35:55.370
I ever heard in my life!

874
00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:58.634
Oh. it's stupid. is it?
It's stupid?

875
00:35:58.634 --> 00:36:01.768
Man. I just saw you do
half your old dance moves.

876
00:36:01.768 --> 00:36:04.727
You had these church ladies
about to make it rain. baby.

877
00:36:04.727 --> 00:36:06.338
I'm just using my calling

878
00:36:06.338 --> 00:36:08.427
to excite these ladies
about the gospel.

879
00:36:08.427 --> 00:36:10.385
That is all.

880
00:36:10.385 --> 00:36:12.996
And also release some
pent-up tension I got going on.

881
00:36:12.996 --> 00:36:14.346
Yeah. no offense. Pastor.

882
00:36:14.346 --> 00:36:16.043
but if you get them
any more excited.

883
00:36:16.043 --> 00:36:17.784
your church is going
to need a champagne room.

884
00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:20.700
Well. if it's sexual tension
you mean.

885
00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:22.223
then maybe I need
to talk to your wife.

886
00:36:22.223 --> 00:36:23.616
Hey. don't you go near
my wife!

887
00:36:23.616 --> 00:36:24.878
Don't you go near my wife.

888
00:36:24.878 --> 00:36:26.184
I done told you about
that before.

889
00:36:26.184 --> 00:36:29.056
I done told you!
Leave my wife alone.

890
00:36:31.537 --> 00:36:33.974
I need some sugar.

891
00:36:38.979 --> 00:36:40.546
There's some sugar.

892
00:36:40.546 --> 00:36:42.069
Desmond?

893
00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:43.113
Eve!

894
00:36:43.113 --> 00:36:46.204
- Oh my goodness!
- Oh. wow!

895
00:36:46.204 --> 00:36:47.683
- Um...
- Whoa!

896
00:36:47.683 --> 00:36:48.858
You look...

897
00:36:48.858 --> 00:36:50.599
I grew a beard.

898
00:36:50.599 --> 00:36:52.906
It's a little different for me.

899
00:36:52.906 --> 00:36:54.777
But you look lovely as ever.

900
00:36:55.648 --> 00:36:58.172
Oh. thank you.

901
00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:01.610
So. how are you?
- Amazing.

902
00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:06.136
I have a little auto body place
out in Pahrump. you know.

903
00:37:06.136 --> 00:37:07.529
Still single. though.

904
00:37:07.964 --> 00:37:10.663
Still haven't found anybody
to treat me as well as you did.

905
00:37:12.273 --> 00:37:14.449
That's very sweet.

906
00:37:14.449 --> 00:37:17.539
Listen. Desmond.
I need to apologize to you.

907
00:37:17.539 --> 00:37:21.021
- Oh. no. no. no.
- No. Please.

908
00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.808
For years. I was very judgmental
of your work.

909
00:37:25.808 --> 00:37:28.637
And now. in hindsight.

910
00:37:28.637 --> 00:37:30.596
I see how women may enjoy it.

911
00:37:32.859 --> 00:37:36.645
Listen. no need to apologize.
As long as you're happy.

912
00:37:40.083 --> 00:37:42.564
- Amos and I are very happy.
- Hmm!

913
00:37:42.564 --> 00:37:46.046
We are blessed and he always
treats me with the utmost...

914
00:37:46.046 --> 00:37:47.526
Respect!

915
00:37:47.526 --> 00:37:49.267
I would never do anything
inappropriate to my wife.

916
00:37:49.267 --> 00:37:51.312
He'd never do anything
inappropriate to me.

917
00:37:51.312 --> 00:37:55.142
But after 25 years.
things can feel a little too...

918
00:37:55.142 --> 00:37:58.363
Tame! My wife's an angel.
I'm a lucky man to have her.

919
00:37:58.363 --> 00:38:02.192
But sometimes you just want
to get wild!

920
00:38:02.192 --> 00:38:06.109
...so mild. In private.
he's the perfect gentleman.

921
00:38:06.109 --> 00:38:09.330
Too gentle! I just want
to go crazy!

922
00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:10.766
You know me!

923
00:38:10.766 --> 00:38:13.769
I'll tell you what's crazy is...

924
00:38:13.769 --> 00:38:15.858
Slim Sexy is now a preacher.

925
00:38:15.858 --> 00:38:18.339
I can't even look at you.

926
00:38:18.339 --> 00:38:21.734
I'll tell you what you can't
look at is your feet. big man.

927
00:38:21.734 --> 00:38:23.866
What about you.
Reverend Gyrate?

928
00:38:23.866 --> 00:38:26.304
I don't know if you born again
or porn again.

929
00:38:26.304 --> 00:38:27.827
- Oh!
- Huh?

930
00:38:27.827 --> 00:38:31.570
I don't care what you say.
I'm satisfied with who I am.

931
00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:33.528
Are you. big man?

932
00:38:33.528 --> 00:38:36.052
The question is; is your wife?

933
00:38:36.052 --> 00:38:38.316
- Oh Lord.
- Hold this.

934
00:38:38.881 --> 00:38:41.884
Hey. come on. I done told you
about my wife.

935
00:38:47.281 --> 00:38:48.587
Yo. are you going
to do something?

936
00:38:48.587 --> 00:38:50.328
I brought him here
to work this shit out.

937
00:38:50.328 --> 00:38:52.895
- Well. it ain't working! Yo!
- Keep on calling!

938
00:38:52.895 --> 00:38:54.375
All right. all right.
all right.

939
00:38:54.375 --> 00:38:55.855
You all in the Lord's house now.

940
00:38:55.855 --> 00:38:58.292
- Sit your ass down!
- Pushing it!

941
00:38:59.424 --> 00:39:01.121
Dignified.
You're in the church.

942
00:39:02.383 --> 00:39:04.603
Luther. I don't care
how you say it. nothing.

943
00:39:04.603 --> 00:39:06.300
I mean. nothing.

944
00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:08.302
is going to change my mind.
I'm good!

945
00:39:08.302 --> 00:39:10.086
- Oh. is that right?
- That's right.

946
00:39:10.086 --> 00:39:11.784
Hey. Rita. are you there?

947
00:39:11.784 --> 00:39:13.002
<i> Yes. I am.</i>

948
00:39:13.002 --> 00:39:14.613
<i>Are you fuckers going
to help or not?</i>

949
00:39:14.613 --> 00:39:18.094
Now. look here. The Moxie's in
trouble and it needs money ASAP.

950
00:39:18.617 --> 00:39:20.401
Now. if you ain't going
to do it for us.

951
00:39:20.401 --> 00:39:22.447
then do it for Rita.

952
00:39:22.925 --> 00:39:25.537
Oh. you remember when
she found your homeless ass

953
00:39:25.537 --> 00:39:28.148
on the bus stop
and made you a Chip.

954
00:39:28.148 --> 00:39:30.280
And Face is already in.

955
00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:32.935
Come on. man.
what would Jesus do...

956
00:39:32.935 --> 00:39:34.197
if he was an old ass stripper?

957
00:39:35.155 --> 00:39:39.289
Look. even if I did say yes.
you're still down a Chip.

958
00:39:39.289 --> 00:39:41.291
And no one's seen that
mask-wearing mute

959
00:39:41.291 --> 00:39:42.597
Dr. X anywhere.

960
00:39:42.597 --> 00:39:44.077
<i> Well. I saw him.</i>

961
00:39:44.077 --> 00:39:46.732
<i>I got lucky and found him
on a medical database.</i>

962
00:39:47.428 --> 00:39:49.299
You mean. X became
a real doctor?

963
00:39:49.299 --> 00:39:51.693
<i>Plastic surgeon.
I just called his office.</i>

964
00:39:51.693 --> 00:39:55.044
<i>He's exactly where you'd expect
to find a doctor on a Sunday.</i>

965
00:39:55.654 --> 00:39:59.440
We do have some special gifts.
and I want to say--

966
00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:00.963
Rita must have gave us
the wrong address.

967
00:40:00.963 --> 00:40:03.183
because the only brothers
I see here are the waiters.

968
00:40:03.183 --> 00:40:05.011
And we're going
to go ahead now

969
00:40:05.011 --> 00:40:06.229
and give our final award.

970
00:40:06.229 --> 00:40:07.840
I think you know who
I'm talking about.

971
00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:10.582
Let's give it up
for Dr. Xander Pike.

972
00:40:20.722 --> 00:40:22.681
I know you Harvard men
really wanted this.

973
00:40:22.681 --> 00:40:24.422
just like you guys want my wife.

974
00:40:24.422 --> 00:40:26.249
I see you looking. she's mine.

975
00:40:28.469 --> 00:40:29.731
Xander's white?

976
00:40:29.731 --> 00:40:31.298
Thus the mask.

977
00:40:31.298 --> 00:40:34.083
- And the flat ass.
- And the small dick.

978
00:40:35.345 --> 00:40:36.956
I'm sure you guys got
a lot of questions.

979
00:40:36.956 --> 00:40:38.827
Um. back in the day.

980
00:40:38.827 --> 00:40:40.394
I was trying to get through
medical school.

981
00:40:40.394 --> 00:40:42.570
and the Chippendales rejected me
because I danced too big.

982
00:40:43.745 --> 00:40:45.138
Saw the Chip auditions.

983
00:40:45.138 --> 00:40:46.966
So. I went to the tanning bed.

984
00:40:46.966 --> 00:40:49.838
shaved my head. got a mask
and. bam. Dr. X!

985
00:40:49.838 --> 00:40:52.275
And. bam. you lied
about being black.

986
00:40:52.275 --> 00:40:54.495
Did not lie. I never said
I was black. You just assumed.

987
00:40:54.495 --> 00:40:55.975
You know what they say
when you assume.

988
00:40:55.975 --> 00:40:57.890
Yeah. you make an ass
out of you

989
00:40:57.890 --> 00:40:59.761
and some dumbass
black strippers.

990
00:40:59.761 --> 00:41:02.111
Doc is out for the reunion.

991
00:41:02.111 --> 00:41:04.723
Why am I out? That was
the best time of my life.

992
00:41:04.723 --> 00:41:08.074
I loved being black.
Being white is so boring!

993
00:41:08.074 --> 00:41:12.382
Between the food. the music.
the dance and the TV shows.

994
00:41:12.382 --> 00:41:13.732
You ever tried to stay awake

995
00:41:13.732 --> 00:41:15.298
to watch an episode
of The Crown?

996
00:41:15.298 --> 00:41:16.778
You know what
it was like for me?

997
00:41:16.778 --> 00:41:18.650
I couldn't get a job anywhere
when the Chips broke up.

998
00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:21.174
Now. you. you're a doctor?

999
00:41:21.174 --> 00:41:22.784
I did get into
a top medical school.

1000
00:41:22.784 --> 00:41:25.091
I'm sure you got in
the top everything.

1001
00:41:25.091 --> 00:41:26.745
You know how easy it is
to get in

1002
00:41:26.745 --> 00:41:28.834
when your name's Alexander
and not Tyriq?

1003
00:41:28.834 --> 00:41:31.140
I didn't name you that.
blame your parents!

1004
00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:34.230
Could we at least take a vote?
I am an original Chocolate Chip.

1005
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:37.364
No! You was just
chocolate dipped.

1006
00:41:37.364 --> 00:41:38.452
The conditions have changed.

1007
00:41:38.452 --> 00:41:40.106
Okay. you know.
you all changed!

1008
00:41:40.106 --> 00:41:42.630
All right. Face. look.
you got four kids.

1009
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:44.458
Amos is a preacher.
- I'm a damn good preacher.

1010
00:41:44.458 --> 00:41:46.329
I know. I know. And Des. Des...

1011
00:41:46.329 --> 00:41:47.853
I gained a smidgen of weight.

1012
00:41:47.853 --> 00:41:49.376
He got a smidgen
of weight. exactly.

1013
00:41:49.376 --> 00:41:52.074
Look. look. look.
it's all or nothing. okay?

1014
00:41:52.074 --> 00:41:54.033
You got it?
Look. if you down with us.

1015
00:41:54.033 --> 00:41:56.601
meet us at the Cookie Club
at 5:00 p.m. tomorrow night.

1016
00:41:56.601 --> 00:41:58.559
I'll be there 4:45.

1017
00:42:00.866 --> 00:42:02.389
Okay. I guess I'm in.

1018
00:42:02.389 --> 00:42:04.522
Now. you said you had daycare.
so who is it?

1019
00:42:06.567 --> 00:42:08.874
Oh. come on. man.
you can't expect me

1020
00:42:08.874 --> 00:42:12.225
to leave Ella. Della. Bella.
and Stella with Rita!

1021
00:42:12.225 --> 00:42:13.879
She can't handle
all these babies!

1022
00:42:13.879 --> 00:42:15.489
Well. let me get
this straight.

1023
00:42:15.489 --> 00:42:17.012
After I washed all your mankinis

1024
00:42:17.012 --> 00:42:19.798
and then I cleaned all the crabs
out of the champagne room

1025
00:42:19.798 --> 00:42:22.061
that I could handle
all you babies.

1026
00:42:22.061 --> 00:42:24.498
but I can't handle those babies?

1027
00:42:25.934 --> 00:42:27.501
Get the fuck out of here.

1028
00:42:27.501 --> 00:42:30.025
- We got it. Luther. we got it.
- It's been a minute.

1029
00:42:30.025 --> 00:42:31.549
Everybody remember
the steps. right?

1030
00:42:32.201 --> 00:42:35.944
Here we go.
Five. six. seven. eight!

1031
00:42:41.863 --> 00:42:43.735
- <i>
- So.
after two decades.</i>

1032
00:42:43.735 --> 00:42:45.519
<i>the Chocolate Chips
were finally back on stage</i>

1033
00:42:45.519 --> 00:42:47.608
<i>to show Merlin their routines.</i>

1034
00:42:47.608 --> 00:42:50.829
<i>Too bad these old motherfuckers
couldn't remember them!</i>

1035
00:42:51.351 --> 00:42:52.613
- What you doing?
- I'm doing...

1036
00:42:52.613 --> 00:42:53.919
I can't move that fast. man!

1037
00:42:53.919 --> 00:42:56.138
Y'all. get this shit right.

1038
00:42:56.138 --> 00:42:58.184
You know how we do this.
Set this mother off.

1039
00:42:58.184 --> 00:43:01.013
Five. six. seven. eight!

1040
00:43:02.231 --> 00:43:04.364
Bring it down. bring it down.

1041
00:43:14.766 --> 00:43:16.376
Terrible!

1042
00:43:20.946 --> 00:43:22.600
- Come on. man.
- The women...

1043
00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:25.994
- This is not a Lil Nas X video!
- Good God!

1044
00:43:25.994 --> 00:43:28.562
Man. do you think
they'll ever get it together?

1045
00:43:29.563 --> 00:43:32.435
Don't know. kid.
Could go either way.

1046
00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:35.177
Lot of issues to work through.

1047
00:43:35.177 --> 00:43:37.179
Yeah. tell me about it.

1048
00:43:37.179 --> 00:43:39.617
No wonder y'all split up
with all that drama.

1049
00:43:40.095 --> 00:43:41.923
I could see why
you're still pissed off

1050
00:43:41.923 --> 00:43:43.751
about losing all that money.

1051
00:43:43.751 --> 00:43:45.492
I could see why you're
so depressed.

1052
00:43:47.233 --> 00:43:49.191
Rita tell you that?

1053
00:43:49.191 --> 00:43:50.845
Rita don't know shit.

1054
00:43:51.324 --> 00:43:53.065
Nobody knows what
really went down.

1055
00:43:55.807 --> 00:43:56.851
All right!

1056
00:43:58.679 --> 00:43:59.724
Let's try it again.

1057
00:44:01.639 --> 00:44:04.598
Work for it! Sexy. let's go!

1058
00:44:04.598 --> 00:44:06.905
Go on. You don't want it.
You don't want success.

1059
00:44:06.905 --> 00:44:08.602
I can tell you don't want it.

1060
00:44:08.602 --> 00:44:10.343
One. to the right.

1061
00:44:12.084 --> 00:44:14.826
To the right. to the left!

1062
00:44:14.826 --> 00:44:16.697
Crush again. crush again!

1063
00:44:16.697 --> 00:44:18.612
Merlin. I expect more of you.

1064
00:44:18.612 --> 00:44:20.832
Bang-bang.
or bang-bang bang-bang?

1065
00:44:20.832 --> 00:44:22.529
The bang's up. you pop
your bangs up too high!

1066
00:44:22.529 --> 00:44:23.530
Yeah. he over-banging.

1067
00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:26.707
Push it! Push high. push high!

1068
00:44:26.707 --> 00:44:29.057
Roll with it. roll with it.

1069
00:44:29.057 --> 00:44:32.104
<i>Suck it up.
Five. six. seven. eight!</i>

1070
00:44:32.104 --> 00:44:35.194
Three... four... go!

1071
00:44:35.194 --> 00:44:39.372
Tea bag! Tea bag! Tea bag!
Tea bag! Tea bag! Tea bag!

1072
00:44:39.372 --> 00:44:40.939
Sexy. that's what
you're going to give me?

1073
00:44:40.939 --> 00:44:42.636
Shut up!

1074
00:44:42.636 --> 00:44:44.594
This is how you
make champions. guys!

1075
00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:01.089
How do you even eat a salad?

1076
00:45:02.090 --> 00:45:04.397
All right. all right.

1077
00:45:04.397 --> 00:45:07.487
Now they started looking
like the way it used to. Yeah!

1078
00:45:08.488 --> 00:45:10.185
Searching for music.

1079
00:45:10.185 --> 00:45:11.665
Picking out costumes.

1080
00:45:12.666 --> 00:45:13.798
And X pretending to be black.

1081
00:45:13.798 --> 00:45:15.147
It's not black. it's caramel.

1082
00:45:15.147 --> 00:45:16.975
Well. it looks
like shit to me.

1083
00:45:16.975 --> 00:45:18.541
This is bullshit. Luther.

1084
00:45:18.541 --> 00:45:20.805
Hey. hey. hey.
it's a reunion show.

1085
00:45:20.805 --> 00:45:22.937
He's supposed to look
the way he did before.

1086
00:45:22.937 --> 00:45:25.374
What's Des going to do?

1087
00:45:25.374 --> 00:45:28.116
Unless you got a time machine.
that ain't going to happen.

1088
00:45:28.726 --> 00:45:30.075
See. that's a fat joke.

1089
00:45:30.075 --> 00:45:31.990
I'm getting tired of these
God damned fat jokes!

1090
00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:34.427
Matter of fact. you know what?
Give me this piece of pie.

1091
00:45:34.427 --> 00:45:36.342
Hey. don't you touch
that pizza now!

1092
00:45:36.342 --> 00:45:37.691
- It's him!
- Yo. yo. guys!

1093
00:45:37.691 --> 00:45:38.866
I think I found
my showcase song.

1094
00:45:38.866 --> 00:45:40.955
and it's one of my mom's
favorite jams.

1095
00:45:45.351 --> 00:45:47.788
- Yo.
- Turn it off. kid.

1096
00:45:47.788 --> 00:45:49.659
All right. God damn it.
enough of this.

1097
00:45:49.659 --> 00:45:51.487
No more bitching
about X's colour

1098
00:45:51.487 --> 00:45:53.228
and no more touching the pizza.

1099
00:45:53.228 --> 00:45:55.535
And nobody plays that song!

1100
00:46:01.846 --> 00:46:03.369
You know what?

1101
00:46:04.849 --> 00:46:06.546
I'm going to work
on my wardrobe.

1102
00:46:07.808 --> 00:46:10.158
I'm going to go look
for a gym.

1103
00:46:15.424 --> 00:46:17.122
I almost smacked you with
the black hand side.

1104
00:46:17.122 --> 00:46:18.819
Don't ever play that song again!

1105
00:46:19.428 --> 00:46:23.737
That song you just played
was Mr. Big's closing song.

1106
00:46:26.392 --> 00:46:27.349
Oh. boy!

1107
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:30.744
Help me. Lord! Help!

1108
00:46:36.489 --> 00:46:38.926
<i> Now. Merlin had
performed for crowds before.</i>

1109
00:46:38.926 --> 00:46:40.493
<i>but never like this.</i>

1110
00:46:40.493 --> 00:46:43.670
<i>So. he was nervous about
showing his ass. literally.</i>

1111
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:46.673
<i>But with Robin and magic
both out of the picture.</i>

1112
00:46:46.673 --> 00:46:48.806
<i>he figured he had
nothing to lose.</i>

1113
00:46:48.806 --> 00:46:51.460
<i>And the only person
he could talk to about it</i>

1114
00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:54.507
<i>was a man who had
lost everything.</i>

1115
00:46:54.507 --> 00:46:56.248
Oh. wow!

1116
00:46:57.684 --> 00:46:59.381
I know what I'm doing here late

1117
00:46:59.381 --> 00:47:00.992
trying to fix
this doggone sound system.

1118
00:47:00.992 --> 00:47:02.602
but what you doing here so late?

1119
00:47:02.602 --> 00:47:04.517
I'm still trying to figure out
my solo. okay?

1120
00:47:04.517 --> 00:47:06.954
I have no idea what it should
be. Luther. I can't do this!

1121
00:47:06.954 --> 00:47:09.652
Here you go with that can't
again. Ain't no can't in Vegas!

1122
00:47:10.479 --> 00:47:12.307
Boy. you good.
don't worry about it.

1123
00:47:12.307 --> 00:47:15.136
You just have to figure out
what your alter-ego is.

1124
00:47:15.136 --> 00:47:16.790
Yeah. your special identity!

1125
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:20.881
Find something that's unique
to you. that makes you unique.

1126
00:47:20.881 --> 00:47:22.535
Okay. well. that's easy
for you to say!

1127
00:47:22.535 --> 00:47:24.842
It's not like you have to get
up here and dance anymore.

1128
00:47:24.842 --> 00:47:26.539
- Oh. you think I don't want to?
- No!

1129
00:47:26.539 --> 00:47:28.019
I would if I could.

1130
00:47:28.019 --> 00:47:30.543
But I can't. so that's
why they got you!

1131
00:47:30.543 --> 00:47:32.501
- All right. well. I didn't
mean nothing by that.

1132
00:47:32.501 --> 00:47:34.939
I just know you had to stop
dancing because of your leg.

1133
00:47:34.939 --> 00:47:37.680
Well. it wasn't just
my leg that got broke.

1134
00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:39.421
But that's. you don't know
nothing about that.

1135
00:47:39.421 --> 00:47:42.772
We ain't worried about it.
Tomorrow is a big night!

1136
00:47:43.251 --> 00:47:44.513
Been a while since
the Chips danced

1137
00:47:44.513 --> 00:47:45.732
in front of a live audience.

1138
00:47:45.732 --> 00:47:48.213
so we're going to have
a little preview.

1139
00:47:59.485 --> 00:48:00.878
Back the fuck up.

1140
00:48:02.488 --> 00:48:03.619
Sorry.

1141
00:48:04.098 --> 00:48:06.318
You're a doctor! Why don't you
just create a bigger cock?

1142
00:48:06.318 --> 00:48:07.754
Well. that's why I became one.

1143
00:48:07.754 --> 00:48:09.930
Women got a lot of options
for body enhancements

1144
00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:11.453
and men. we just don't.

1145
00:48:11.453 --> 00:48:12.759
But I plan to change that.

1146
00:48:12.759 --> 00:48:15.370
- Like. dick implants?
- Close.

1147
00:48:15.893 --> 00:48:18.417
I know one woman who'd like
a little something extra.

1148
00:48:19.157 --> 00:48:20.506
I just can't give it to her.

1149
00:48:21.072 --> 00:48:23.813
How did we not know
this dude was white?

1150
00:48:24.597 --> 00:48:27.339
<i> And as my baby looked
into the crowd.</i>

1151
00:48:27.339 --> 00:48:29.907
<i>he couldn't believe how much
his world had changed.</i>

1152
00:48:29.907 --> 00:48:32.213
<i>But what the Chips
didn't realize</i>

1153
00:48:32.213 --> 00:48:34.781
<i>was that the world
had changed on them. too.</i>

1154
00:48:36.304 --> 00:48:38.176
Oh. shoot!

1155
00:48:38.176 --> 00:48:40.874
What's wrong. kid. you nervous?
- Yes. man!

1156
00:48:40.874 --> 00:48:42.093
There's so many people
out there!

1157
00:48:42.093 --> 00:48:43.616
It's a small crowd.
just work out!

1158
00:48:43.616 --> 00:48:45.618
Yeah. so if you mess up.
nobody is going to know!

1159
00:48:45.618 --> 00:48:49.187
You about to pop your cherry!

1160
00:48:49.187 --> 00:48:51.406
You old and stuff. but haven't
you all heard of the internet?

1161
00:48:51.406 --> 00:48:54.105
They record one mistake.
and it's on there forever.

1162
00:48:54.105 --> 00:48:55.454
- He's scared!

1163
00:48:56.281 --> 00:48:57.586
This is DJ St. Aubyn.

1164
00:48:57.586 --> 00:49:00.198
It's been a long time.
but guess who's back?

1165
00:49:00.198 --> 00:49:01.721
The Chocolate Chips!

1166
00:49:03.331 --> 00:49:05.290
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1167
00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:06.465
Let's go!

1168
00:49:06.465 --> 00:49:08.336
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1169
00:49:12.906 --> 00:49:14.429
Ladies and gentlemen.
I present to you

1170
00:49:14.429 --> 00:49:16.518
Des The Body.
Dr. X.

1171
00:49:16.518 --> 00:49:18.912
Slim Sexy. The Face.

1172
00:49:18.912 --> 00:49:21.523
and Merlin.
The Chocolate Chips!

1173
00:49:29.357 --> 00:49:30.793
We fucking froze. man!

1174
00:49:30.793 --> 00:49:32.752
Ain't nobody said it
was going to be easy.

1175
00:49:32.752 --> 00:49:34.014
All right. just shake it off!

1176
00:49:34.014 --> 00:49:35.885
We looked like fools
out there. man!

1177
00:49:35.885 --> 00:49:38.149
But that's what tonight
is for. right?

1178
00:49:38.149 --> 00:49:39.237
To work the kinks out.

1179
00:49:39.237 --> 00:49:41.326
Face. you up next. baby.
- What?

1180
00:49:41.326 --> 00:49:44.372
Man. there's somebody's babies
out there. go be they daddy.

1181
00:49:44.372 --> 00:49:47.506
- You got it. Face.
- Come on. man. come on. baby!

1182
00:49:47.506 --> 00:49:49.638
- Give them the Face!
- Bring it home. Face.

1183
00:49:50.117 --> 00:49:53.338
Ladies. welcome to the stage
your new daddy.

1184
00:49:53.338 --> 00:49:55.035
The Face.

1185
00:50:13.184 --> 00:50:16.100
Face out here trying
to be your father figure.

1186
00:50:16.839 --> 00:50:18.841
Hey. hey. wait. wait. what?

1187
00:50:18.841 --> 00:50:20.539
Is the stripper
brushing her hair?

1188
00:50:21.627 --> 00:50:24.021
That's kind of weird!

1189
00:50:24.021 --> 00:50:25.805
And kind of sexy.

1190
00:50:25.805 --> 00:50:28.025
Oh. hell. Dang it. Face.

1191
00:50:28.025 --> 00:50:30.157
I didn't literally mean
be their daddy.

1192
00:50:33.117 --> 00:50:34.466
Uh-oh.

1193
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:37.686
Looks like someone
needs a spanking.

1194
00:51:00.361 --> 00:51:03.756
Watch out. ladies. he's about
to put you in time-out!

1195
00:51:04.365 --> 00:51:05.975
Shit!

1196
00:51:07.412 --> 00:51:09.631
<i> And even though
my son's new path</i>

1197
00:51:09.631 --> 00:51:12.199
<i>was drifting away
from one of his passions.</i>

1198
00:51:12.199 --> 00:51:14.114
<i>Merlin never let his journey</i>

1199
00:51:14.114 --> 00:51:16.551
<i>take him too far away
from the other.</i>

1200
00:51:16.551 --> 00:51:18.118
<i>Robin.</i>

1201
00:51:18.118 --> 00:51:19.467
<i>Quick. turn on your TV!</i>

1202
00:51:19.467 --> 00:51:21.469
<i>A Different World marathon
is on right now.</i>

1203
00:51:21.469 --> 00:51:24.081
Remember how your mom would let
us watch reruns with her

1204
00:51:24.081 --> 00:51:25.473
when we were kids?

1205
00:51:25.473 --> 00:51:27.867
You know I'm watching it
already!

1206
00:51:27.867 --> 00:51:29.303
Dwayne Wayne's about
to crash the wedding.

1207
00:51:29.303 --> 00:51:30.304
it's about to go down!

1208
00:51:30.304 --> 00:51:31.392
I know.

1209
00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:36.745
<i>You do know he's
the bad guy. right?</i>

1210
00:51:37.137 --> 00:51:38.747
Byron was going to be like Obama

1211
00:51:38.747 --> 00:51:40.140
and Whitley could
have been his Michelle.

1212
00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:42.142
Robin. you can't be serious
right now.

1213
00:51:42.142 --> 00:51:43.578
He's literally saving her.

1214
00:51:43.578 --> 00:51:45.406
Whitley is Dwayne's true love.

1215
00:51:45.406 --> 00:51:47.756
Yet he waits for
the last second to speak up?

1216
00:51:47.756 --> 00:51:49.932
<i>He should have left her
with Olivia Pope's daddy</i>

1217
00:51:49.932 --> 00:51:51.108
<i>and sat down.</i>

1218
00:51:51.108 --> 00:51:52.848
Yeah. all right.

1219
00:51:52.848 --> 00:51:55.112
All right. it's about
to go down.

1220
00:51:55.547 --> 00:51:58.071
<i>Whitley. I love you.
and if you'll have me.</i>

1221
00:51:58.071 --> 00:52:00.552
<i>I want you to be my wife.
- What the hell are you doing?</i>

1222
00:52:00.552 --> 00:52:01.944
<i>Hey. I'm sorry. Byron.
I love her!</i>

1223
00:52:01.944 --> 00:52:03.511
<i>Die! Yes. die!</i>

1224
00:52:03.511 --> 00:52:05.513
<i>- Let him go. man!
- Will you have me. Dwayne.</i>

1225
00:52:05.513 --> 00:52:07.907
<i>as your lawfully wedded husband
from this day forth.</i>

1226
00:52:07.907 --> 00:52:10.431
<i>to have and to hold
in richer. for poorer?</i>

1227
00:52:10.431 --> 00:52:12.955
<i>Baby. please? Please?</i>

1228
00:52:12.955 --> 00:52:14.392
<i>I do!</i>

1229
00:52:17.612 --> 00:52:20.137
It's iconic. Robin.
It's iconic!

1230
00:52:20.528 --> 00:52:21.747
<i>It gets me every time.</i>

1231
00:52:22.182 --> 00:52:25.185
See? Dwayne is the true hero.

1232
00:52:25.185 --> 00:52:27.666
Nope. still the bad guy.

1233
00:52:27.666 --> 00:52:29.058
<i>What if somebody
wanted to stop you</i>

1234
00:52:29.058 --> 00:52:30.234
<i>from marrying the wrong person?</i>

1235
00:52:30.234 --> 00:52:32.323
I'd hope he'd have
the courage to do it

1236
00:52:32.323 --> 00:52:33.933
before my damn wedding day.

1237
00:52:33.933 --> 00:52:36.718
<i>This is real life.
not a TV show.</i>

1238
00:52:37.197 --> 00:52:38.677
Yeah...

1239
00:52:39.982 --> 00:52:41.854
I guess it is a different world.

1240
00:52:43.812 --> 00:52:46.337
<i>Is anybody
getting married here today?</i>

1241
00:52:46.337 --> 00:52:47.990
<i>Oh. hey. hey!</i>

1242
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:51.559
Hey. Slim Sexy.
You ready for your big night?

1243
00:52:53.170 --> 00:52:55.650
Look. man. I'm not sure.

1244
00:52:55.650 --> 00:52:59.219
Look. yesterday. those ladies
were way more handsy

1245
00:52:59.219 --> 00:53:01.569
than even in our day!
- Yes. they were.

1246
00:53:01.569 --> 00:53:02.962
They got me pacing
back and forth

1247
00:53:02.962 --> 00:53:04.572
talking to the Lord right now!

1248
00:53:04.572 --> 00:53:07.445
Look. look. I want to help Rita.
believe me.

1249
00:53:07.445 --> 00:53:10.709
But I love my wife. man.
I can't be in no room

1250
00:53:10.709 --> 00:53:14.930
playing grab ass with a room
full of horny women like that!

1251
00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:16.584
- Okay. okay!
- I'm missing my birthmark!

1252
00:53:16.584 --> 00:53:18.586
Look. put it in your solo.

1253
00:53:18.586 --> 00:53:20.414
All right. just pick a song.

1254
00:53:20.414 --> 00:53:23.069
Pick a song that tells them
what to do.

1255
00:53:23.069 --> 00:53:24.853
And. Luther. I'm sorry to
interrupt. I'm sorry Slim.

1256
00:53:24.853 --> 00:53:26.159
but I asked you about the name.

1257
00:53:26.159 --> 00:53:27.813
but you didn't tell me
if it was cool yet.

1258
00:53:27.813 --> 00:53:29.206
Like. it sounded
good in my head.

1259
00:53:29.206 --> 00:53:30.685
but I didn't know
if it was too much

1260
00:53:30.685 --> 00:53:31.991
or if it was too...

1261
00:53:33.122 --> 00:53:34.689
- Look.
- Nah.

1262
00:53:35.777 --> 00:53:36.778
Nah!

1263
00:53:38.302 --> 00:53:39.172
I'm a Chip?

1264
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:42.393
You a Chocolate Chip.

1265
00:53:45.309 --> 00:53:48.486
You have anything mocha-brown
and sugar-sweet?

1266
00:53:53.142 --> 00:53:56.058
Good choice.
It's the best in town.

1267
00:53:56.058 --> 00:53:57.756
Eve!

1268
00:53:57.756 --> 00:53:59.714
So. what are you doing here?
You're not in Pahrump?

1269
00:53:59.714 --> 00:54:01.716
Are you doing some body work
here in Vegas?

1270
00:54:01.716 --> 00:54:03.805
Yeah. you could say that.

1271
00:54:03.805 --> 00:54:05.546
Well. I'm happy to see you.

1272
00:54:05.546 --> 00:54:06.982
What are you doing here?

1273
00:54:06.982 --> 00:54:09.158
I always stop in here
after I drop Amos off

1274
00:54:09.158 --> 00:54:11.160
at our sister chapel
to teach Bible study.

1275
00:54:14.425 --> 00:54:16.078
Hands off. ladies.

1276
00:54:16.078 --> 00:54:18.342
Slim's about to take you
to church.

1277
00:54:19.604 --> 00:54:21.519
Hallelujah.

1278
00:54:24.609 --> 00:54:26.306
I hope I didn't give you
the wrong idea

1279
00:54:26.306 --> 00:54:28.265
the last time we spoke.
- No!

1280
00:54:28.656 --> 00:54:29.962
Amos and I are fine.

1281
00:54:29.962 --> 00:54:32.486
I just think
we've lost that spark.

1282
00:54:33.008 --> 00:54:34.706
Well. you can always
get that back.

1283
00:54:34.706 --> 00:54:36.708
You know what they say
about a spark;

1284
00:54:36.708 --> 00:54:39.624
it doesn't take much
to turn into a flame.

1285
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:43.236
Guess that depends on
who's lighting it.

1286
00:54:46.326 --> 00:54:47.849
Do you like what you see?

1287
00:54:47.849 --> 00:54:49.982
Yes. Lord.

1288
00:54:50.461 --> 00:54:52.245
I'm talking about
the menu. silly.

1289
00:54:52.245 --> 00:54:55.335
I was talking about the same
thing you were talking about!

1290
00:54:55.335 --> 00:54:57.163
It's like we were reading
the same menu.

1291
00:54:57.163 --> 00:54:58.904
- Exactly. Pie. Menu.
- It's weird.

1292
00:54:59.687 --> 00:55:01.689
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1293
00:55:01.689 --> 00:55:03.691
Um...

1294
00:55:04.953 --> 00:55:06.738
Um! Um!

1295
00:55:08.479 --> 00:55:11.090
Forget church. this is heaven.

1296
00:55:11.090 --> 00:55:14.311
Come on. a little cheating
ain't so bad. Little bit?

1297
00:55:14.311 --> 00:55:17.401
No. I got to watch what I eat.

1298
00:55:21.579 --> 00:55:24.973
Look at that big old handsome
block of chocolate.

1299
00:55:28.237 --> 00:55:30.588
Whipped cream.
rainbow sprinkles.

1300
00:55:30.588 --> 00:55:32.285
maraschino cherries!

1301
00:55:32.285 --> 00:55:35.462
We're going to change your name
from Big Des to Big Diabetes!

1302
00:55:39.336 --> 00:55:43.340
Yo. we're going to need some
more money to cover that body.

1303
00:55:48.345 --> 00:55:49.694
Hey. baby.

1304
00:55:49.694 --> 00:55:51.783
Ladies.

1305
00:55:51.783 --> 00:55:53.524
You all ladies looking good.

1306
00:55:53.524 --> 00:55:55.656
You all looking real good
out there.

1307
00:55:55.656 --> 00:55:59.094
I'm Mr. Big.
and it has been 25 years

1308
00:55:59.094 --> 00:56:00.226
since we've been on this stage.

1309
00:56:00.226 --> 00:56:03.098
And I want to say.
it is so good.

1310
00:56:03.098 --> 00:56:05.753
it is so good...

1311
00:56:07.929 --> 00:56:09.322
...to be back on the strip!

1312
00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:14.240
All right. well.
without further ado. ladies.

1313
00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:16.503
I'm going to give you
what you all been waiting for.

1314
00:56:16.503 --> 00:56:19.506
Mr. Black Magic!

1315
00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:40.222
<i> And abracadabra!
Just like that. my Merlin...</i>

1316
00:56:40.222 --> 00:56:42.007
<i>I mean. Black Magic.</i>

1317
00:56:42.007 --> 00:56:43.922
<i>made all his fears disappear</i>

1318
00:56:43.922 --> 00:56:47.578
<i>and kept his fans coming back
for more. For real!</i>

1319
00:56:47.578 --> 00:56:50.232
<i>Them crazy ladies went lining
up every night</i>

1320
00:56:50.232 --> 00:56:53.410
<i>hoping to get a look at what
my baby had up his sleeve.</i>

1321
00:57:02.810 --> 00:57:04.899
Shake your booty!

1322
00:57:07.293 --> 00:57:08.860
Oh. that's right.
the Chips are back

1323
00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:10.122
and they've never been bigger.

1324
00:57:27.008 --> 00:57:30.316
Hold on just a second.
Yeah. credit card. hold on.

1325
00:57:37.105 --> 00:57:38.542
All right. there you go.

1326
00:57:51.946 --> 00:57:54.079
But I don't want
any threesomes in the bathroom.

1327
00:57:54.079 --> 00:57:55.297
The last time you did this.

1328
00:57:55.297 --> 00:57:57.299
we needed a spackle knife
to take it off.

1329
00:58:00.041 --> 00:58:01.042
<i> Hey. Merlin!</i>

1330
00:58:01.042 --> 00:58:02.391
Hey. Robin. what's up?

1331
00:58:02.391 --> 00:58:03.741
I have something to tell you.

1332
00:58:03.741 --> 00:58:06.178
but it sounds super loud there.

1333
00:58:06.178 --> 00:58:08.528
Oh. yeah. yeah. well.
I'm about to do a show.

1334
00:58:08.528 --> 00:58:10.399
Wow. they sure do love magic!

1335
00:58:10.399 --> 00:58:12.532
Magic is really big out here.

1336
00:58:12.532 --> 00:58:14.142
<i> Show us your dick!</i>

1337
00:58:14.926 --> 00:58:16.101
Wait. what was that?

1338
00:58:16.101 --> 00:58:18.538
They said.
"Show us your tricks!"

1339
00:58:18.538 --> 00:58:19.931
<i>I'm a magician.</i>

1340
00:58:19.931 --> 00:58:21.585
They're actually
calling me now. Robin.

1341
00:58:21.585 --> 00:58:23.108
<i>so I'm sorry!
We can talk later.</i>

1342
00:58:23.108 --> 00:58:23.935
Wait. wait. Merlin...

1343
00:58:23.935 --> 00:58:25.502
Okay. Bye. bye.

1344
00:58:25.850 --> 00:58:26.807
Bye.

1345
00:58:31.246 --> 00:58:34.641
I knew this shit would work.
I knew it would work! I knew it.

1346
00:58:39.516 --> 00:58:41.256
What's that new move called?

1347
00:58:41.256 --> 00:58:42.954
I call it the Apple Pie.

1348
00:58:42.954 --> 00:58:44.695
I like that. Yeah.

1349
00:58:48.437 --> 00:58:50.091
That's a nice ride.

1350
00:58:50.091 --> 00:58:52.703
You working that white man
privilege stereotype.

1351
00:58:52.703 --> 00:58:54.835
Stereotype?
Look who's talking. dude.

1352
00:58:54.835 --> 00:58:56.489
You've got four kids
and a baby momma.

1353
00:58:56.489 --> 00:58:57.838
Says the man
that wears blackface.

1354
00:58:57.838 --> 00:58:59.057
Never painted my face.

1355
00:58:59.057 --> 00:59:00.319
Says the man
that wears black ass!

1356
00:59:00.319 --> 00:59:01.712
I only do it for the show.

1357
00:59:01.712 --> 00:59:03.365
it's not like I walk around town
like that.

1358
00:59:03.365 --> 00:59:05.106
Dude. there's nothing
you could say

1359
00:59:05.106 --> 00:59:06.325
to convince me
that I'm privileged!

1360
00:59:06.325 --> 00:59:08.066
Agreed. There's nothing else
to say.

1361
00:59:08.066 --> 00:59:10.503
You ever heard of a place
called Duke's Diner?

1362
00:59:11.852 --> 00:59:13.898
I got some of Eve's receipts.

1363
00:59:13.898 --> 00:59:15.508
And I call over there.
and they says

1364
00:59:15.508 --> 00:59:19.077
she's been having coffee
every week with her husband.

1365
00:59:19.077 --> 00:59:20.774
but I've never been there
before!

1366
00:59:20.774 --> 00:59:22.471
Maybe he's a friend.

1367
00:59:22.471 --> 00:59:25.300
If there's a male friend
who has the audacity

1368
00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:28.565
to take his ass over there
and sit with my wife

1369
00:59:28.565 --> 00:59:30.436
and have coffee every damn week.

1370
00:59:30.436 --> 00:59:32.786
he deserves an ass whooping!

1371
00:59:33.482 --> 00:59:35.093
Come on. you're overreacting.

1372
00:59:35.093 --> 00:59:36.747
Eve wouldn't do you like that. man.

1373
00:59:36.747 --> 00:59:38.357
she's not that kind of woman!

1374
00:59:39.358 --> 00:59:40.489
I don't know. man.

1375
00:59:41.839 --> 00:59:43.710
The romance has cooled.

1376
00:59:44.581 --> 00:59:46.191
And it's crazy.
because I'm out here

1377
00:59:46.191 --> 00:59:47.932
shaking my ass for strangers.

1378
00:59:47.932 --> 00:59:50.761
but I can't do it
with my own damn wife!

1379
00:59:50.761 --> 00:59:52.632
I feel like a damn hypocrite!

1380
00:59:52.632 --> 00:59:54.591
I may need to practice
what I preach.

1381
00:59:54.591 --> 00:59:57.681
Maybe you should preach
what you practice.

1382
00:59:57.681 --> 00:59:59.421
If you like shaking ass in
front of women.

1383
00:59:59.421 --> 01:00:01.075
maybe you should do it
in front of your wife.

1384
01:00:02.076 --> 01:00:04.383
If you don't.
somebody else will.

1385
01:00:05.427 --> 01:00:06.907
And they ain't going to want
no coffee.

1386
01:00:08.126 --> 01:00:09.257
That's for damn sure.

1387
01:00:09.867 --> 01:00:11.608
They're going
to want that pussy.

1388
01:00:15.350 --> 01:00:17.875
<i> So. as the Chips
blew up again.</i>

1389
01:00:17.875 --> 01:00:19.224
<i>word started to spread</i>

1390
01:00:19.224 --> 01:00:21.748
<i>and Rita got calls
for some big money gigs.</i>

1391
01:00:21.748 --> 01:00:23.228
It's going to be worth it.

1392
01:00:24.490 --> 01:00:28.755
<i>So. Rita dug up some
old ass superhero costumes</i>

1393
01:00:28.755 --> 01:00:31.671
<i>and booked Merlin and the guys
for a bachelorette party.</i>

1394
01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:39.810
All right. everyone!

1395
01:00:43.117 --> 01:00:46.730
<i>And while my baby was
up there bumping and grinding.</i>

1396
01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:48.601
<i>they brought in
the bachelorette.</i>

1397
01:00:48.601 --> 01:00:49.950
Night Man!

1398
01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:52.910
<i>And y'all never going
to guess who it was.</i>

1399
01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:55.303
<i>Aw. shit. y'all already know!</i>

1400
01:00:55.913 --> 01:00:58.698
Robin? Robin. oh sh...

1401
01:00:58.698 --> 01:01:00.657
Oh my! Oh. it's so big!

1402
01:01:01.614 --> 01:01:03.355
I'm sorry. sir.

1403
01:01:03.355 --> 01:01:06.053
It's fine.
it's fine. it's fine.

1404
01:01:06.053 --> 01:01:08.316
Look. I'm sorry
to alarm you. ma'am.

1405
01:01:08.316 --> 01:01:11.058
Hey. wait one second.
Night Man.

1406
01:01:11.885 --> 01:01:16.498
Come on. Gia! All I asked
for was spa time. massage.

1407
01:01:16.498 --> 01:01:19.110
and to hang with my girls.
I mean. what is this?

1408
01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:20.677
But we did all that. sweetie!

1409
01:01:20.677 --> 01:01:22.504
Now it's time to hang
with the guys.

1410
01:01:22.504 --> 01:01:24.115
When I mean hang. it's like...

1411
01:01:24.855 --> 01:01:26.421
Okay. music. thank you!

1412
01:01:31.731 --> 01:01:33.690
- Hi.
- Hi.

1413
01:01:42.002 --> 01:01:44.265
Wait. where do I put this?

1414
01:01:46.137 --> 01:01:48.792
Oh... Um...

1415
01:01:51.272 --> 01:01:53.448
It's not like that...

1416
01:02:01.587 --> 01:02:03.850
Oh my God. I'm so random!

1417
01:02:03.850 --> 01:02:05.896
Wait. what the hell?
Gia. what are you doing?

1418
01:02:05.896 --> 01:02:07.375
You need to take these off!

1419
01:02:07.375 --> 01:02:09.334
No. you two need
to get a room.

1420
01:02:09.334 --> 01:02:11.379
You guys are
a regular dynamic duo.

1421
01:02:11.379 --> 01:02:12.772
Okay? All right.

1422
01:02:12.772 --> 01:02:14.905
I'm going to lock you in a room
until you get laid

1423
01:02:14.905 --> 01:02:17.429
or we run out of stripper tips.
whoever comes first.

1424
01:02:17.429 --> 01:02:18.604
Um. great.

1425
01:02:25.916 --> 01:02:27.656
I'm sorry about all that.

1426
01:02:27.656 --> 01:02:29.484
So. you have no keys. huh.
do you?

1427
01:02:30.442 --> 01:02:33.488
I guess it's time for plan B.

1428
01:02:33.488 --> 01:02:36.622
Oh. uh-uh! Sorry. we are not
having sex. no.

1429
01:02:36.622 --> 01:02:40.017
No. no. no. no.
I just meant for the cuffs.

1430
01:02:40.017 --> 01:02:41.540
For the handcuffs.

1431
01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:44.586
Do you happen to have
a bobby pin or...

1432
01:02:44.586 --> 01:02:48.025
Oh. no. But I know where
we can find one.

1433
01:02:49.417 --> 01:02:52.246
I just thought you should know
Robin just left

1434
01:02:52.246 --> 01:02:54.988
with one of
these stripper brothas.

1435
01:02:54.988 --> 01:03:00.254
Damn. I can't believe
she would do me like that!

1436
01:03:00.254 --> 01:03:01.952
<i>Yeah. Rob's my girl.</i>

1437
01:03:01.952 --> 01:03:04.998
but I would hate to see a good.
fine man like you get played.

1438
01:03:05.694 --> 01:03:07.174
Good looking. I'm on it.

1439
01:03:07.174 --> 01:03:08.480
Of course. B. any time!

1440
01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:10.438
You know I am here
for you for whatever...

1441
01:03:10.438 --> 01:03:11.831
I'm on it. thank you.
good looking.

1442
01:03:11.831 --> 01:03:13.790
Literally what...

1443
01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:14.660
Blaze?

1444
01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:17.489
I think we're in
this room right over here.

1445
01:03:18.359 --> 01:03:20.666
- I'm Night Man!
- Right here.

1446
01:03:22.973 --> 01:03:24.931
Oh. nice place.

1447
01:03:25.932 --> 01:03:27.586
- As soon as Gia said

1448
01:03:27.586 --> 01:03:28.892
she was giving me
a bachelorette party.

1449
01:03:28.892 --> 01:03:30.328
I booked this room.

1450
01:03:30.328 --> 01:03:32.069
I'm not into that kind
of thing. No offense!

1451
01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:34.158
I just don't think
it's appropriate

1452
01:03:34.158 --> 01:03:35.376
if you already found
the right guy.

1453
01:03:35.376 --> 01:03:37.726
I see. Um...

1454
01:03:37.726 --> 01:03:39.641
But are you sure
he's the right guy?

1455
01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:42.470
Huh... Yeah!

1456
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:44.081
I mean. he's handsome.

1457
01:03:44.995 --> 01:03:46.910
His career is on fire.

1458
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:50.391
And everyone says I'd be crazy
not to marry him anyway.

1459
01:03:50.391 --> 01:03:52.393
So. yeah.

1460
01:03:53.655 --> 01:03:56.397
But are you in love...

1461
01:03:59.009 --> 01:04:00.314
...with him?

1462
01:04:01.968 --> 01:04:05.276
What? Damn it!
I can't do this.

1463
01:04:05.276 --> 01:04:07.234
Why don't you just
call it off?

1464
01:04:08.192 --> 01:04:09.367
Um...

1465
01:04:10.194 --> 01:04:14.111
No. the handcuffs.
I can't open them.

1466
01:04:14.111 --> 01:04:15.590
The handcuffs.

1467
01:04:17.462 --> 01:04:18.855
Silly Night Man!

1468
01:04:18.855 --> 01:04:21.074
911? There's an emergency.

1469
01:04:21.074 --> 01:04:24.730
There's a young innocent woman
being taken advantage of

1470
01:04:24.730 --> 01:04:26.340
by some strippers
in a hotel room.

1471
01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:28.952
Did I mention that
they're all...

1472
01:04:28.952 --> 01:04:29.996
Black?

1473
01:04:29.996 --> 01:04:31.650
Yeah.

1474
01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:34.087
I'll take one of these.
Hold tight. hold tight.

1475
01:04:36.176 --> 01:04:38.744
It's not my first time in cuffs.

1476
01:04:38.744 --> 01:04:40.441
Right.

1477
01:04:40.441 --> 01:04:42.182
Guess that's part of your job.

1478
01:04:42.182 --> 01:04:44.054
Nice work. Thank you.

1479
01:04:50.974 --> 01:04:53.063
I want them to think
they got their money's worth.

1480
01:04:53.063 --> 01:04:54.891
Can you stay a while
before you go?

1481
01:04:57.850 --> 01:04:59.896
- Sure. sure.
- Thanks.

1482
01:05:01.071 --> 01:05:03.464
- I can give you a hand.
- Yeah. I think I need that.

1483
01:05:03.464 --> 01:05:04.465
Yeah. okay.

1484
01:05:12.386 --> 01:05:14.040
You think Merlin's
all right. man?

1485
01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:15.607
Oh. he's good. man.

1486
01:05:15.607 --> 01:05:18.044
He's probably somewhere butt
naked with the bride-to-be!

1487
01:05:18.044 --> 01:05:19.872
- He did leave his cape.
- I got it!

1488
01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:22.179
Why are they searching
the cars?

1489
01:05:22.179 --> 01:05:23.354
What?

1490
01:05:23.354 --> 01:05:24.616
Why are they checking
inside the cars?

1491
01:05:24.616 --> 01:05:25.747
Can't be for us. right?

1492
01:05:25.747 --> 01:05:27.488
We the only brothers out here.

1493
01:05:27.488 --> 01:05:30.535
- Dr. X. you better drive.
- Why. it's your car?

1494
01:05:30.535 --> 01:05:31.362
You're white.

1495
01:05:32.754 --> 01:05:34.365
We all know the routine.

1496
01:05:34.365 --> 01:05:36.802
We all get in the back
and we all hide.

1497
01:05:36.802 --> 01:05:38.369
Yeah. but what
are we hiding for?

1498
01:05:38.369 --> 01:05:39.761
We didn't do anything wrong.

1499
01:05:39.761 --> 01:05:42.242
Come on. guys. I'm not scared
of the police.

1500
01:05:42.242 --> 01:05:44.679
That's 'cause they're
not looking for you. Exy.

1501
01:05:44.679 --> 01:05:46.290
Right.

1502
01:05:47.204 --> 01:05:49.815
Help us out. X.
Drive the car.

1503
01:05:49.815 --> 01:05:52.209
- I'm just saying.
- Son of a bitch!

1504
01:05:52.209 --> 01:05:54.124
- What?
- It's you!

1505
01:05:54.124 --> 01:05:56.996
You're the one who's been
going out with my wife!

1506
01:05:58.128 --> 01:05:59.303
It's you!

1507
01:05:59.303 --> 01:06:00.478
You dropped my fucking cigarette.

1508
01:06:00.478 --> 01:06:02.306
No. you backstabbing bastard!

1509
01:06:02.306 --> 01:06:05.396
- She likes pie!
- Guys. guys. chill out!

1510
01:06:05.396 --> 01:06:07.615
It's him! He needs
to chill out!

1511
01:06:07.615 --> 01:06:09.922
Tell that snake ass right there
to chill out!

1512
01:06:09.922 --> 01:06:11.097
Somebody going down.

1513
01:06:11.097 --> 01:06:12.925
According to your wife.
it ain't you!

1514
01:06:12.925 --> 01:06:14.144
That's all I'm saying.

1515
01:06:14.144 --> 01:06:15.232
What did you say?

1516
01:06:15.232 --> 01:06:17.060
I said. "According
to your wife..."

1517
01:06:19.018 --> 01:06:21.020
God! Jesus Christ. Amos!

1518
01:06:23.066 --> 01:06:26.112
I'm going to snatch your beard
off your fucking face!

1519
01:06:32.118 --> 01:06:33.641
Hello. Officer.
what's the problem?

1520
01:06:34.033 --> 01:06:36.383
Oh. just looking for some
thug male dancers.

1521
01:06:36.383 --> 01:06:37.776
You are free to go.

1522
01:06:38.342 --> 01:06:41.258
Um. hold on. why did you
call them thugs?

1523
01:06:41.258 --> 01:06:42.999
Because they fit
the description.

1524
01:06:43.956 --> 01:06:45.218
Really?

1525
01:06:45.218 --> 01:06:48.700
Just some ghetto stripper motherfuckers.

1526
01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:51.311
I'll have you know. Officer.

1527
01:06:51.311 --> 01:06:54.836
I am one of those
ghetto strippers...

1528
01:06:54.836 --> 01:06:56.099
motherfucker!

1529
01:06:56.099 --> 01:06:58.710
Keystone cop. shit.
you got me fucked...

1530
01:06:58.710 --> 01:07:00.581
Sorry. I'm sorry!

1531
01:07:00.581 --> 01:07:02.496
My name is Dr. Alexander Pike.
I work at Memorial Health.

1532
01:07:02.496 --> 01:07:03.758
I'm sorry. I'm insured!

1533
01:07:03.758 --> 01:07:05.673
I give to the Policeman's Ball
every year!

1534
01:07:06.065 --> 01:07:08.111
I guess you feel
pretty black now.

1535
01:07:08.111 --> 01:07:10.983
- Hey. man. I never understood

1536
01:07:10.983 --> 01:07:12.767
all this shit you guys
go through every day

1537
01:07:12.767 --> 01:07:14.682
that I don't have
to worry about.

1538
01:07:14.682 --> 01:07:16.902
I'm really sorry.
- Don't be.

1539
01:07:16.902 --> 01:07:18.773
You know what. it's just like
you said the first time;

1540
01:07:18.773 --> 01:07:20.297
we didn't do anything wrong.

1541
01:07:20.297 --> 01:07:21.385
It's just how it is.

1542
01:07:21.385 --> 01:07:22.951
You know what?

1543
01:07:22.951 --> 01:07:24.605
I got an idea
to get us out of here.

1544
01:07:25.911 --> 01:07:27.956
All right. do your thing.
Baby Jesus.

1545
01:07:27.956 --> 01:07:30.307
Wait. wait. whoa. whoa.
where are you going?

1546
01:07:30.307 --> 01:07:31.873
- We're good!
- What are you doing?

1547
01:07:31.873 --> 01:07:34.050
Officer. excuse me.
can I speak to you for a minute?

1548
01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:35.964
Slim. pray. pray for us. Slim.

1549
01:07:35.964 --> 01:07:37.488
We going to jail.

1550
01:07:37.488 --> 01:07:39.925
I got a thong on.
we going to jail.

1551
01:07:39.925 --> 01:07:41.927
- We going to jail. bro.
- I got a thong...

1552
01:07:41.927 --> 01:07:44.234
- Hey. you four are free to go.
- What?

1553
01:07:45.235 --> 01:07:47.019
What did you show him
in your phone?

1554
01:07:47.019 --> 01:07:48.499
I showed him a picture
of Bambi.

1555
01:07:48.499 --> 01:07:51.763
and then I offered him
a free boob job for his wife.

1556
01:07:51.763 --> 01:07:55.027
I got to do it for free.
but now we're free!

1557
01:07:55.027 --> 01:07:56.159
So...

1558
01:07:56.159 --> 01:07:57.334
All right. well. hey!

1559
01:07:57.334 --> 01:07:59.771
Oh God. oh God!

1560
01:08:00.163 --> 01:08:01.903
He's talking to you.

1561
01:08:01.903 --> 01:08:04.950
I am privileged! Oh God!

1562
01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:06.647
Well. you got the privilege
of driving now.

1563
01:08:06.647 --> 01:08:08.649
- Yeah.
- Least I could do.

1564
01:08:17.658 --> 01:08:18.833
<i> Next thing you know.</i>

1565
01:08:18.833 --> 01:08:20.574
<i>my son woke up
in a strange bed.</i>

1566
01:08:20.574 --> 01:08:22.141
<i>unsure where he was.</i>

1567
01:08:22.141 --> 01:08:25.144
<i>wearing a mask
and some torn leopard panties.</i>

1568
01:08:25.144 --> 01:08:27.146
<i>But we all been there.
am I right?</i>

1569
01:08:27.146 --> 01:08:29.148
Oh. just me?

1570
01:08:37.156 --> 01:08:39.463
I'm Night Man. Night Man.

1571
01:08:40.986 --> 01:08:43.031
I can't go out there like this.

1572
01:08:46.992 --> 01:08:48.689
<i>A stripper
in a superhero outfit?</i>

1573
01:08:48.689 --> 01:08:50.169
I can't believe
you just let them run off.

1574
01:08:50.169 --> 01:08:51.692
I didn't know she
had another room!

1575
01:08:51.692 --> 01:08:53.216
And what's up with security?

1576
01:08:53.216 --> 01:08:55.305
When I called. they treated it
like it was some big joke.

1577
01:08:55.305 --> 01:08:57.176
Okay. well. you do have
a prank show. B.

1578
01:08:59.744 --> 01:09:01.354
Hold on!

1579
01:09:02.181 --> 01:09:04.401
Well. look who has
their own room.

1580
01:09:04.401 --> 01:09:07.273
So what? I just needed
to be alone. I mean...

1581
01:09:07.273 --> 01:09:09.362
And... are you?

1582
01:09:09.884 --> 01:09:11.843
Alone?
- What?

1583
01:09:11.843 --> 01:09:14.150
Of course I'm alone. I swear!

1584
01:09:14.150 --> 01:09:15.716
Why would you ever
think otherwise?

1585
01:09:15.716 --> 01:09:17.327
Good morning. guys.
welcome to Vegas!

1586
01:09:17.327 --> 01:09:18.371
What?

1587
01:09:18.371 --> 01:09:19.503
Yo...

1588
01:09:19.503 --> 01:09:20.982
Why is the clown in your room?

1589
01:09:20.982 --> 01:09:21.983
Magician!

1590
01:09:21.983 --> 01:09:23.637
Why are you in my room?

1591
01:09:23.637 --> 01:09:25.509
Well. momma said that
you were out here.

1592
01:09:25.509 --> 01:09:28.686
so I asked the maid to let me in
to surprise you!

1593
01:09:28.686 --> 01:09:31.863
Okay. then what's up with
the outfit. Mervin?

1594
01:09:31.863 --> 01:09:33.081
It's Merlin.

1595
01:09:33.952 --> 01:09:36.476
And a charity magic show
at the hospital.

1596
01:09:36.476 --> 01:09:40.741
The kids love The King.
so I'm Black Elvis.

1597
01:09:40.741 --> 01:09:42.961
Blelvis!
- You satisfied?

1598
01:09:42.961 --> 01:09:46.182
How is this going to work
if we don't have trust. Blaze?

1599
01:09:46.573 --> 01:09:47.792
Not cool. Blaze.

1600
01:09:47.792 --> 01:09:49.228
That's really not cool. man.

1601
01:09:49.228 --> 01:09:53.014
Anyway. if you don't mind.

1602
01:09:53.014 --> 01:09:55.016
I just came to take
my old friend out on the town.

1603
01:09:55.016 --> 01:09:57.932
Yeah. I don't think so.
because we got other plans.

1604
01:09:57.932 --> 01:10:00.544
Right. baby? We got other plans.
- No. not anymore.

1605
01:10:00.544 --> 01:10:03.416
I think I'd rather go be
with someone who truly knows me.

1606
01:10:03.416 --> 01:10:04.852
Okay. it's like that?

1607
01:10:05.549 --> 01:10:07.420
It's like that.
so I should just...

1608
01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:08.900
I should leave then. huh?

1609
01:10:09.422 --> 01:10:11.729
All right. Let's go.

1610
01:10:11.729 --> 01:10:13.078
- Oh. yeah. Okay.
- Let's go.

1611
01:10:14.688 --> 01:10:16.473
He's an asshole sometimes.

1612
01:10:16.473 --> 01:10:19.258
I know. Yeah.
I sense it. I sense it.

1613
01:10:21.782 --> 01:10:25.308
Hey. man. that's my sign!
Don't worry about the door.

1614
01:10:25.308 --> 01:10:28.441
First room service.
now a limo. How do you do it?

1615
01:10:28.441 --> 01:10:30.182
A magician never reveals
his tricks.

1616
01:10:30.182 --> 01:10:33.707
Hey. man! Hey. man.
that's my suit. that's my car!

1617
01:10:33.707 --> 01:10:34.926
Blelvis has left the building!

1618
01:10:34.926 --> 01:10:37.233
Drive. drive. sir. please!

1619
01:10:38.712 --> 01:10:40.236
So. you said
he was the only one

1620
01:10:40.236 --> 01:10:41.976
in and out of Robin's room
all night?

1621
01:10:42.977 --> 01:10:45.458
Whoa. so the clown
is the stripper?

1622
01:10:46.198 --> 01:10:47.852
Humpty is hung!

1623
01:10:49.506 --> 01:10:51.290
And he's playing my girl
for a fool.

1624
01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:52.813
I better text her.

1625
01:10:52.813 --> 01:10:54.162
Wait. wait. wait.

1626
01:10:54.685 --> 01:10:55.903
I know a better way

1627
01:10:55.903 --> 01:10:57.688
you and I could show her
who's the real fool.

1628
01:10:58.515 --> 01:11:00.386
So. when can I see
your magic show?

1629
01:11:00.386 --> 01:11:02.345
Oh. yeah. yeah. yeah.

1630
01:11:02.345 --> 01:11:04.085
So. this is actually
my week off.

1631
01:11:04.085 --> 01:11:06.174
But this trip isn't about me.

1632
01:11:06.174 --> 01:11:08.655
it's about you and
your bachelorette party.

1633
01:11:08.655 --> 01:11:11.005
Not really. This trip
is about Blaze.

1634
01:11:11.005 --> 01:11:12.746
We came to see Blaze's
first comedy show.

1635
01:11:12.746 --> 01:11:15.793
He's been blowing up ever since
he announced our engagement.

1636
01:11:15.793 --> 01:11:17.055
But are you. um...

1637
01:11:17.055 --> 01:11:18.448
Are you ready to marry him?

1638
01:11:20.145 --> 01:11:22.278
I have to be.

1639
01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:23.583
He made a deal

1640
01:11:23.583 --> 01:11:25.150
to livestream the wedding online
as a big event.

1641
01:11:25.933 --> 01:11:27.195
Blaze's dream wedding.

1642
01:11:27.195 --> 01:11:29.023
Wait. you're livestreaming
your wedding?

1643
01:11:29.023 --> 01:11:30.329
Yeah.

1644
01:11:30.329 --> 01:11:31.983
That does not sound like
your dream wedding!

1645
01:11:31.983 --> 01:11:34.594
I pictured your wedding
as something smaller.

1646
01:11:34.594 --> 01:11:36.857
just people you know
and a little less planned.

1647
01:11:36.857 --> 01:11:38.990
More free. like you and...

1648
01:11:40.034 --> 01:11:42.385
Damn. that does sound like me.

1649
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:45.388
But the publicity helps him.
so it's all good.

1650
01:11:45.388 --> 01:11:48.304
I just wish he knew me
like you do. you know?

1651
01:11:48.826 --> 01:11:51.916
For the wedding. he wants me
to wear my hair straight.

1652
01:11:51.916 --> 01:11:54.266
But I don't know.
I'd rather go natural.

1653
01:11:54.266 --> 01:11:57.443
He's buying me a Chanel gown. yeah.

1654
01:11:57.443 --> 01:12:00.533
But I prefer something simple. He...

1655
01:12:01.969 --> 01:12:04.711
He literally wants trap music
for our first dance.

1656
01:12:05.364 --> 01:12:06.452
I mean. really?

1657
01:12:06.452 --> 01:12:08.498
Why don't you just
tell him that?

1658
01:12:08.498 --> 01:12:09.760
Don't you want him to know?

1659
01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:13.067
I want him to want to know.
You know?

1660
01:12:13.067 --> 01:12:16.767
Like I just try to be positive.
one day he will.

1661
01:12:16.767 --> 01:12:18.551
How do you do that?

1662
01:12:19.204 --> 01:12:20.727
No. seriously.
ever since we were kids.

1663
01:12:20.727 --> 01:12:22.468
I ain't ever seen you mad.

1664
01:12:23.077 --> 01:12:24.340
Why bother?

1665
01:12:24.992 --> 01:12:27.473
If I trust you.
I can't be mad at you.

1666
01:12:28.474 --> 01:12:32.043
And if I don't trust you.
why are we even together?

1667
01:12:34.393 --> 01:12:36.221
<i> But just as
Robin was wondering</i>

1668
01:12:36.221 --> 01:12:38.615
<i>if her fiancé
really had her back.</i>

1669
01:12:38.615 --> 01:12:41.661
<i>turns out it was Merlin
who needed to cover his ass.</i>

1670
01:12:43.010 --> 01:12:44.664
- There's my Robin.
- Hey. babe.

1671
01:12:44.664 --> 01:12:47.145
I'm sorry about what happened
this morning. I just...

1672
01:12:47.145 --> 01:12:48.712
The thought of you being
with another man.

1673
01:12:48.712 --> 01:12:49.713
it just drives me crazy.

1674
01:12:49.713 --> 01:12:50.931
Blaze.
don't even trip. man.

1675
01:12:50.931 --> 01:12:52.324
we're just friends.
- Yeah. no. no.

1676
01:12:52.324 --> 01:12:53.847
I wasn't talking about you. Melvin.

1677
01:12:53.847 --> 01:12:55.458
I was talking about someone
who could be competition.

1678
01:12:55.458 --> 01:13:01.028
But listen. my warm-up comic
dropped out of my show tomorrow.

1679
01:13:01.028 --> 01:13:02.378
and I need a new act.

1680
01:13:03.074 --> 01:13:04.641
What?

1681
01:13:04.641 --> 01:13:06.207
You want me to be...

1682
01:13:06.207 --> 01:13:07.470
Tomorrow. do my magic act?

1683
01:13:07.905 --> 01:13:10.603
Yeah. You don't do
another act. do you?

1684
01:13:10.603 --> 01:13:12.692
- No. man. of course not!
- So. you're free?

1685
01:13:12.692 --> 01:13:15.782
- I'm all free. man. thank you!
- I appreciate you. bro.

1686
01:13:15.782 --> 01:13:18.263
I want to catch up with my girl.
but bring your A-game tomorrow.

1687
01:13:18.263 --> 01:13:19.525
No problem. Mr. Blaze. sir.

1688
01:13:19.525 --> 01:13:20.570
I'll be there early. too.

1689
01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:22.093
Congrats. Congrats. Merlin!

1690
01:13:22.093 --> 01:13:24.008
Yeah. yeah. yeah. Yeah.

1691
01:13:24.008 --> 01:13:26.271
Yo. can I get some of
this Bulleit bourbon. please?

1692
01:13:26.271 --> 01:13:27.577
Man!

1693
01:13:27.968 --> 01:13:29.448
Thank you.

1694
01:13:29.448 --> 01:13:30.667
Um!

1695
01:13:34.453 --> 01:13:36.977
Okay. you heard Merlin.

1696
01:13:36.977 --> 01:13:38.283
This is a huge shot for him

1697
01:13:38.283 --> 01:13:40.198
that could lead to a lot
of really big things.

1698
01:13:40.198 --> 01:13:43.810
And it could also be
the end of the Chips.

1699
01:13:43.810 --> 01:13:46.030
So. I say. fellas.
we go out there tonight.

1700
01:13:46.030 --> 01:13:48.075
perform like it's our last show.

1701
01:13:48.075 --> 01:13:49.642
Hey. let's go out
with a bang. guys.

1702
01:13:49.642 --> 01:13:52.210
Bang. bang!
- Bang!

1703
01:13:52.210 --> 01:13:55.256
Wait. guys. so...
Where's Luther at?

1704
01:13:56.083 --> 01:13:59.217
Honestly. he wasn't too happy
when he heard

1705
01:13:59.217 --> 01:14:01.262
that the Chips might be
breaking up again.

1706
01:14:01.785 --> 01:14:03.700
Oh. look. guys.
let's wrap this up.

1707
01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:06.180
because I got a private show
with a lady.

1708
01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:07.791
Oh!

1709
01:14:07.791 --> 01:14:09.314
Okay. all right!

1710
01:14:09.314 --> 01:14:10.794
Let me get the room. okay?

1711
01:14:10.794 --> 01:14:12.404
All right. guess we better go.

1712
01:14:12.404 --> 01:14:15.276
Mr. X here a lot of time
to put on that spray tan.

1713
01:14:16.843 --> 01:14:19.629
Nope. not anymore.
I threw all that stuff out.

1714
01:14:19.629 --> 01:14:22.545
From now on. I'm 100 % me.

1715
01:14:22.545 --> 01:14:25.199
What about
stuffing your crotch?

1716
01:14:25.199 --> 01:14:26.331
Okay. 95 %.

1717
01:14:26.331 --> 01:14:27.767
I've got to keep
the schlong. man.

1718
01:14:27.767 --> 01:14:29.508
Got to keep a big schlong.
you know?

1719
01:14:29.508 --> 01:14:30.553
Get out of here. man!

1720
01:14:30.553 --> 01:14:32.555
- Dr. X!
- Yeah.

1721
01:14:32.555 --> 01:14:35.471
Get them. kid. Oh. man!

1722
01:14:36.384 --> 01:14:38.909
Put on something sexy.
a little...

1723
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:41.346
...thong-thong.

1724
01:14:41.346 --> 01:14:44.784
Wow. this should
be a good night.

1725
01:14:45.393 --> 01:14:50.137
We ought to dim these lights.
give it the right setting.

1726
01:14:51.399 --> 01:14:53.358
Cookie Club!

1727
01:14:53.967 --> 01:14:55.882
Going to miss the guys
being together.

1728
01:14:55.882 --> 01:14:58.145
Cookie Club in pink.

1729
01:14:58.145 --> 01:14:59.669
Back at it again.

1730
01:14:59.669 --> 01:15:01.801
Some things never change.

1731
01:15:01.801 --> 01:15:04.108
Know what'd be a good
color to put this in?

1732
01:15:04.108 --> 01:15:06.023
Black and blue.
- Black and blue?

1733
01:15:06.023 --> 01:15:07.807
Yeah. uh-huh.

1734
01:15:07.807 --> 01:15:09.461
What's up with that. huh?

1735
01:15:09.461 --> 01:15:11.115
You think I'm a bitch
or something?

1736
01:15:11.115 --> 01:15:13.944
You think I'm going to sit here
while you seduce my wife?

1737
01:15:13.944 --> 01:15:15.728
You think that's going
to happen. Playboy?

1738
01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:19.079
First of all. I wasn't trying
to seduce your wife. okay?

1739
01:15:19.079 --> 01:15:22.387
I set up your solo

1740
01:15:22.387 --> 01:15:24.563
so she could see you dance.

1741
01:15:24.563 --> 01:15:28.001
She... loves you. okay?

1742
01:15:33.354 --> 01:15:35.182
Tired. ain't you?

1743
01:15:40.274 --> 01:15:43.408
I want you to share
the spirit that you have

1744
01:15:43.408 --> 01:15:45.715
with these other women
with your wife. man!

1745
01:15:45.715 --> 01:15:48.239
When I was choking you...

1746
01:15:48.239 --> 01:15:49.153
did you feel anything?

1747
01:15:49.153 --> 01:15:50.458
No.

1748
01:15:50.807 --> 01:15:51.764
Boop!

1749
01:15:56.813 --> 01:15:58.336
Desmond. I came as you asked.

1750
01:15:58.336 --> 01:15:59.642
but I think you got
the wrong impression.

1751
01:15:59.642 --> 01:16:01.992
I love my husband
very. very much.

1752
01:16:03.210 --> 01:16:05.604
And your husband loves you.

1753
01:16:05.604 --> 01:16:07.345
Amos. what...

1754
01:16:08.955 --> 01:16:09.956
Do you work here?

1755
01:16:11.610 --> 01:16:12.655
Yeah.

1756
01:16:13.786 --> 01:16:15.875
We've been helping Rita out
with the hotel.

1757
01:16:16.354 --> 01:16:18.051
But the truth is.

1758
01:16:18.051 --> 01:16:21.054
a part of me was gone
and I had to find it.

1759
01:16:22.447 --> 01:16:26.886
Look. now. I know you're upset.
but I needed an outlet.

1760
01:16:29.323 --> 01:16:30.586
Yeah.

1761
01:16:32.239 --> 01:16:33.458
I'm sorry.

1762
01:16:35.068 --> 01:16:37.375
I'm not upset
at what you're doing!

1763
01:16:37.375 --> 01:16:39.507
I'm upset at who
you're doing it for.

1764
01:16:40.508 --> 01:16:41.814
It should be me.

1765
01:16:42.685 --> 01:16:44.425
I didn't think
that's what you wanted.

1766
01:16:45.252 --> 01:16:47.515
You're a virtuous woman. Eve.

1767
01:16:47.515 --> 01:16:49.039
I ain't a nun!

1768
01:16:49.039 --> 01:16:51.215
All you had to do was ask.

1769
01:16:51.215 --> 01:16:53.609
Whatever it is
you've been looking for.

1770
01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:55.611
you can share it with me!

1771
01:16:59.310 --> 01:17:00.616
So...

1772
01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:03.140
...what do we do now?

1773
01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:10.060
I said.
"Share it with me. damn it!"

1774
01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:11.452
- Oh.
- Oh.

1775
01:17:11.452 --> 01:17:13.672
I just happen
to have an opening.

1776
01:17:15.674 --> 01:17:17.807
DJ. how about a little
something?

1777
01:17:17.807 --> 01:17:19.765
I got you. Slim!

1778
01:17:19.765 --> 01:17:21.288
Oh...

1779
01:17:22.246 --> 01:17:23.551
Oh!

1780
01:17:24.596 --> 01:17:25.641
Come on!

1781
01:17:27.077 --> 01:17:28.121
Oh. oh!

1782
01:17:28.905 --> 01:17:30.080
Pray for me.

1783
01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:31.908
That's a good thing you did. Des.

1784
01:17:32.604 --> 01:17:34.519
Yeah. I guess I'm just
a regular old saint.

1785
01:17:35.825 --> 01:17:38.088
Good looking out for me. too.
I see you called my wife.

1786
01:17:39.393 --> 01:17:41.613
Come on. give me
some big brown sugar!

1787
01:17:43.441 --> 01:17:45.225
I didn't call your wife.

1788
01:17:45.225 --> 01:17:48.315
Listen. it doesn't matter
who she came for.

1789
01:17:48.315 --> 01:17:51.231
All that matters is
who she's going home with.

1790
01:17:51.231 --> 01:17:54.408
Now. go out there and give her
a reason to want to go home.

1791
01:17:54.931 --> 01:17:56.889
Easy for you guys to say.
you both got brown sugar!

1792
01:17:56.889 --> 01:18:00.240
Come on. this brown sugar.
white sugar. it's just sugar!

1793
01:18:02.939 --> 01:18:04.897
I'm about to put her
in a diabetic coma!

1794
01:18:08.771 --> 01:18:13.514
Ladies. I hope you all are
ready for some white chocolate!

1795
01:18:40.977 --> 01:18:44.371
Go. white boy. go.
white boy. go!

1796
01:18:47.157 --> 01:18:49.115
Guess whose credit score
just went up?

1797
01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:11.050
Uh-uh. girls. put your money
back in your purses.

1798
01:19:11.050 --> 01:19:12.878
That there is my man!

1799
01:19:35.814 --> 01:19:39.035
All right. all right.
all right.

1800
01:19:39.035 --> 01:19:42.821
Now a man with something big
in front of him.

1801
01:19:44.344 --> 01:19:47.086
No. not that.
I'm talking about his future.

1802
01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:51.134
Yes. coming to the stage for
his final performance

1803
01:19:51.134 --> 01:19:52.700
with the Chocolate Chips...

1804
01:19:53.049 --> 01:19:54.398
Jesus!

1805
01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:56.966
Mister...

1806
01:19:56.966 --> 01:19:58.750
Mr. Black Magic.

1807
01:20:09.848 --> 01:20:13.286
Shake those jewels. baby.
the crown jewels!

1808
01:20:13.286 --> 01:20:15.245
Oh. God!

1809
01:20:36.266 --> 01:20:40.574
Go. Mr. Black Magic. go!
Go. Mr. Black Magic. go!

1810
01:20:40.574 --> 01:20:42.663
Go. Mr. Black Magic. go!

1811
01:20:46.885 --> 01:20:48.931
<i> So. as my baby gave
his last dance</i>

1812
01:20:48.931 --> 01:20:50.628
<i>with the Chocolate Chips.</i>

1813
01:20:50.628 --> 01:20:52.717
<i>it was clear that
he had finally learned</i>

1814
01:20:52.717 --> 01:20:54.632
<i>how to do things his way.</i>

1815
01:20:57.243 --> 01:20:59.985
<i>Like I've been telling him
all his life.</i>

1816
01:20:59.985 --> 01:21:02.901
<i>you have to decide if you are
going to go big or go home.</i>

1817
01:21:02.901 --> 01:21:04.468
Shake 'em. shake 'em.
shake 'em!

1818
01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:09.168
<i>And for Merlin.
there was only one choice.</i>

1819
01:21:10.213 --> 01:21:11.649
<i>Go big!</i>

1820
01:21:33.323 --> 01:21:34.759
Wow!

1821
01:21:36.761 --> 01:21:38.328
Haven't been this excited
for your show

1822
01:21:38.328 --> 01:21:39.372
since I was your assistant.

1823
01:21:39.372 --> 01:21:42.680
Yo. me too! Man!

1824
01:21:43.811 --> 01:21:45.988
God. I just hope
I don't blow it.

1825
01:21:45.988 --> 01:21:47.685
Now. Merlin. stop.

1826
01:21:47.685 --> 01:21:49.817
You know what I'm going to say.
- What?

1827
01:21:49.817 --> 01:21:51.558
Clearly you can do this.

1828
01:21:52.995 --> 01:21:54.344
You believe me. don't you?

1829
01:21:56.346 --> 01:21:57.913
I do.

1830
01:21:59.305 --> 01:22:01.003
Oh my fucking...
Everything is so unprofessional.

1831
01:22:01.003 --> 01:22:03.570
You all. can I have the stage?
- Hey. babe.

1832
01:22:03.570 --> 01:22:05.790
Babe. I do love you.
but I need y'all to leave.

1833
01:22:05.790 --> 01:22:06.965
- Okay.
- Okay.

1834
01:22:06.965 --> 01:22:08.706
- So that I can rehearse.
- See you.

1835
01:22:08.706 --> 01:22:10.055
Okay. I'll catch you
later. babe.

1836
01:22:10.055 --> 01:22:11.970
Blaze? Sorry. I know
you're kind of busy.

1837
01:22:11.970 --> 01:22:13.972
But I just wanted to say thank
you again

1838
01:22:13.972 --> 01:22:15.539
for looking out for me.
- Yeah.

1839
01:22:15.539 --> 01:22:17.976
And I just wanted
to return the favor

1840
01:22:17.976 --> 01:22:19.978
by looking out for you.
so listen. okay.

1841
01:22:19.978 --> 01:22:22.372
So. about that wedding
you're planning.

1842
01:22:22.372 --> 01:22:24.026
Robin not feeling it.
- She told you that?

1843
01:22:24.026 --> 01:22:25.636
How do you know that?
- I just know her.

1844
01:22:25.636 --> 01:22:27.768
And she's not into all the hype.
you know what I mean?

1845
01:22:27.768 --> 01:22:30.293
Like. she's all about small and...

1846
01:22:30.293 --> 01:22:31.859
- Small.
- ...personal at her wedding.

1847
01:22:31.859 --> 01:22:34.036
And. dude. about the designer
gowns and all that stuff?

1848
01:22:34.036 --> 01:22:35.951
She's not really into it.
it don't really float her boat.

1849
01:22:35.951 --> 01:22:38.518
Go more like. cultural.
- Cultural.

1850
01:22:38.518 --> 01:22:40.346
Cultural. I'm telling you.
it's the move. it's the move.

1851
01:22:40.346 --> 01:22:41.957
That's the move. All right.

1852
01:22:41.957 --> 01:22:44.002
And she really prefers
old school R&B over trap music.

1853
01:22:44.002 --> 01:22:46.352
Yeah. good looking out.

1854
01:22:46.352 --> 01:22:47.963
Good looking out.
I'll keep that in mind.

1855
01:22:51.575 --> 01:22:53.707
<i> Finally.
my baby's big night.</i>

1856
01:22:53.707 --> 01:22:56.362
<i>I even flew my ass in
to see Merlin shine.</i>

1857
01:22:56.362 --> 01:22:58.364
<i>And he was ready
to leave stripper life.</i>

1858
01:22:58.364 --> 01:23:02.020
<i>but he still had another
big dick to deal with.</i>

1859
01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:03.500
What's up. y'all?
You all know me.

1860
01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:05.676
You just got Blazed.
you know me.

1861
01:23:06.198 --> 01:23:07.808
Blazed.

1862
01:23:08.287 --> 01:23:10.898
Welcome to Blaze's house.
y'all.

1863
01:23:13.162 --> 01:23:15.729
And when you're in my house.
it's all about fun. okay?

1864
01:23:15.729 --> 01:23:18.036
So. I have a special treat
for you tonight.

1865
01:23:18.036 --> 01:23:19.298
A special treat!

1866
01:23:19.298 --> 01:23:20.473
I want to introduce you

1867
01:23:20.473 --> 01:23:23.824
to start the show off
to my main man.

1868
01:23:23.824 --> 01:23:27.263
the Amazing Marlow!

1869
01:23:27.263 --> 01:23:29.047
Come out here. Marlow.

1870
01:23:30.483 --> 01:23:34.922
Did he just call him Marlow?
Internet jackass.

1871
01:23:36.272 --> 01:23:37.490
His name is Merlin.

1872
01:23:37.490 --> 01:23:38.665
Hey. what's up. everybody?

1873
01:23:38.665 --> 01:23:40.189
- That's my baby.
- Is this thing on?

1874
01:23:40.189 --> 01:23:44.062
Okay. so. it's actually
the Amazing Merlin.

1875
01:23:44.062 --> 01:23:46.978
I'm actually here
to perform the art

1876
01:23:46.978 --> 01:23:50.677
of presta-digitation!

1877
01:23:50.677 --> 01:23:53.289
Hey. whoa. enough with
the big words. buddy. okay?

1878
01:23:53.289 --> 01:23:55.682
But you're here. yes?
- Yeah.

1879
01:23:55.682 --> 01:24:00.296
Because you have
an impressive gift. yes?

1880
01:24:00.296 --> 01:24:02.733
Yeah. yeah. yeah.
It's quite impressive.

1881
01:24:02.733 --> 01:24:04.517
But let me just tell you
a little backstory.

1882
01:24:04.517 --> 01:24:06.693
It's always been a big part
of me since I was a kid

1883
01:24:06.693 --> 01:24:10.871
and it just kind of kept
growing as I got older.

1884
01:24:10.871 --> 01:24:12.786
Wow. yeah. well.
yeah. yeah. that's crazy.

1885
01:24:12.786 --> 01:24:15.920
Well. I'm glad
that you hung in there.

1886
01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:17.661
I've been hanging.

1887
01:24:17.661 --> 01:24:19.315
Yeah. well. yeah. yeah.
'cause it's clear to see

1888
01:24:19.315 --> 01:24:22.361
that you are
the total package.

1889
01:24:22.361 --> 01:24:24.363
- That shit ain't funny.
- Come on. man.

1890
01:24:24.363 --> 01:24:26.670
You're like a natural.
Like me.

1891
01:24:26.670 --> 01:24:30.413
Like I consider myself like
the Michael Jordan of comedy.

1892
01:24:30.413 --> 01:24:32.415
Whereas with you. I feel like

1893
01:24:32.415 --> 01:24:35.374
you're more of a Magic Johnson!

1894
01:24:36.593 --> 01:24:39.117
That's literally
what I've been saying.

1895
01:24:39.117 --> 01:24:41.859
I've been saying that
the whole time!

1896
01:24:41.859 --> 01:24:43.513
My mom been telling me that.
too!

1897
01:24:43.513 --> 01:24:45.297
Your mom told you that?
Your mom told you that.

1898
01:24:45.297 --> 01:24:46.429
Well. look at the screens.

1899
01:24:46.429 --> 01:24:47.952
Like. what do the screens
tell you?

1900
01:24:48.735 --> 01:24:49.997
That's you. yeah?

1901
01:24:51.434 --> 01:24:54.698
That's you. that's you. right?
Yeah?

1902
01:24:58.919 --> 01:25:00.704
Oh my God.

1903
01:25:00.704 --> 01:25:02.445
That's you. right?

1904
01:25:04.142 --> 01:25:06.579
It looks like you. so.

1905
01:25:13.064 --> 01:25:17.373
You just got Blazed!

1906
01:25:24.510 --> 01:25:27.209
Did homie just trip
on his third leg?

1907
01:25:28.601 --> 01:25:30.647
Lady and gentleman.

1908
01:25:30.647 --> 01:25:33.911
it's time for us
to suit up. Come on!

1909
01:25:38.394 --> 01:25:39.569
Merlin!

1910
01:25:42.615 --> 01:25:45.140
You spent that whole night
with me and didn't tell me?

1911
01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:47.533
I don't believe this!

1912
01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:59.415
I think he just did that.
I know you're not laughing.

1913
01:25:59.806 --> 01:26:01.852
I know you're not laughing.
Mr. Narcos.

1914
01:26:01.852 --> 01:26:04.333
You know what? You're kind
of like a knockoff Narcos.

1915
01:26:04.333 --> 01:26:06.378
You probably put baking soda
in that shit?

1916
01:26:15.126 --> 01:26:16.954
<i> After seeing
that video.</i>

1917
01:26:16.954 --> 01:26:19.217
<i>I realized that my son
had a big secret</i>

1918
01:26:19.217 --> 01:26:21.437
<i>he was too afraid to tell me.</i>

1919
01:26:21.437 --> 01:26:24.222
<i>But it was hard for me
to be mad at him</i>

1920
01:26:24.222 --> 01:26:26.790
<i>since I kept a big secret
from him too.</i>

1921
01:26:27.312 --> 01:26:30.576
Merlin. you know I would
never judge you.

1922
01:26:31.708 --> 01:26:33.362
Why didn't you tell me?

1923
01:26:33.362 --> 01:26:35.146
I was tired
of being a big joke.

1924
01:26:35.886 --> 01:26:37.322
I just wanted
to do things my way.

1925
01:26:37.757 --> 01:26:39.063
But you did.

1926
01:26:39.063 --> 01:26:40.804
You came to Vegas.
you pursued your dreams...

1927
01:26:40.804 --> 01:26:43.198
Mom. but it's still
just a dream.

1928
01:26:43.198 --> 01:26:44.808
Blaze exposed me in front
of everybody

1929
01:26:44.808 --> 01:26:46.984
like a kid
at a talent show and...

1930
01:26:46.984 --> 01:26:49.247
The point is;
I'm not a magician!

1931
01:26:49.247 --> 01:26:50.988
Okay. I'm...

1932
01:26:50.988 --> 01:26:52.119
It's just time to wake up.

1933
01:26:52.119 --> 01:26:53.686
No. it's not!

1934
01:26:53.686 --> 01:26:56.341
You have to see it if you're
going to achieve it. baby.

1935
01:26:56.341 --> 01:26:57.734
Forget about him. he's a hater.

1936
01:26:57.734 --> 01:26:59.257
Well. that's easy for you
to say.

1937
01:26:59.257 --> 01:27:01.259
I just lost the girl
and the job of my dreams.

1938
01:27:01.259 --> 01:27:02.652
I can't see nothing good
about it.

1939
01:27:02.652 --> 01:27:04.828
Hey. kid. you need to get back
on that stage

1940
01:27:04.828 --> 01:27:06.438
before this fool crash and burn.

1941
01:27:06.438 --> 01:27:08.092
You can still save
this shit show!

1942
01:27:08.092 --> 01:27:10.225
- Wait. for real?
- Yeah. come on!

1943
01:27:10.225 --> 01:27:12.488
Luther! Um!

1944
01:27:12.488 --> 01:27:14.838
Good to see you again. baby.

1945
01:27:14.838 --> 01:27:17.580
Verna? God damn. that's you?

1946
01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:19.059
How do y'all two know
each other?

1947
01:27:20.409 --> 01:27:24.456
Well. the truth is me and
Luther used to get it in

1948
01:27:24.456 --> 01:27:26.763
back in the day until
he fucked it all up.

1949
01:27:26.763 --> 01:27:28.460
Well. that's because
you ran out on me

1950
01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:30.767
when you caught me
with the waitress.

1951
01:27:30.767 --> 01:27:32.812
Look. Verna. you had the flu.
it was...

1952
01:27:32.812 --> 01:27:36.468
It wasn't the flu. stupid.
it was morning sickness!

1953
01:27:36.468 --> 01:27:40.080
And don't try to blame me
for your cheating ass ways.

1954
01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:43.475
Merlin. I have something
I need to tell you.

1955
01:27:44.824 --> 01:27:47.044
That's your daddy.
- What?

1956
01:27:47.044 --> 01:27:50.047
Now. I sent you to Rita so
that you could find yourself

1957
01:27:50.047 --> 01:27:53.137
and potentially find him.

1958
01:27:53.137 --> 01:27:55.008
and you guys could meet
on your own terms.

1959
01:27:55.008 --> 01:27:57.881
This is your son?
This is your boy?

1960
01:27:57.881 --> 01:28:01.319
That's our son.
Happy Father's Day.

1961
01:28:03.321 --> 01:28:05.367
You funny. mom. that's...

1962
01:28:07.543 --> 01:28:09.327
You're being serious.
You're being serious?

1963
01:28:09.327 --> 01:28:11.677
Yes. But we don't have time
to talk about this right now.

1964
01:28:11.677 --> 01:28:13.505
We do have time for it!
What the hell?

1965
01:28:13.505 --> 01:28:15.028
Can I get a minute
to process this?

1966
01:28:15.028 --> 01:28:17.074
I mean. I've been with this man
for a whole month.

1967
01:28:17.074 --> 01:28:18.989
I don't even understand why...
- Merlin!

1968
01:28:18.989 --> 01:28:20.295
It's time for you to get
on stage

1969
01:28:20.295 --> 01:28:21.470
and live out your dream.

1970
01:28:21.470 --> 01:28:24.124
Now. go and do it your way.

1971
01:28:24.124 --> 01:28:25.387
You can cuss me out later.

1972
01:28:30.696 --> 01:28:32.698
- My way.
- Your way.

1973
01:28:32.698 --> 01:28:35.310
Yeah. okay. Okay.

1974
01:28:36.702 --> 01:28:37.964
All right.

1975
01:28:37.964 --> 01:28:39.270
And make that magic.

1976
01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:43.666
Okay.

1977
01:28:45.276 --> 01:28:46.451
That's my boy?

1978
01:28:47.670 --> 01:28:49.280
That's your son.

1979
01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:51.195
Especially from the waist down.

1980
01:28:56.505 --> 01:28:58.507
Give Drake his jacket back.

1981
01:28:58.507 --> 01:29:00.204
- Hey. hey. what's up?
- I know Drake!

1982
01:29:00.204 --> 01:29:01.988
No. no. he doesn't know Drake.
it's fine.

1983
01:29:01.988 --> 01:29:04.295
Hey. I'm about to save the show.
I'm going to save the show.

1984
01:29:04.295 --> 01:29:06.297
Hey. what's up. guys?

1985
01:29:06.297 --> 01:29:08.560
I hope you remember me.
I'm the Amazing Merlin.

1986
01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:09.953
And I'm going to perform a trick

1987
01:29:09.953 --> 01:29:11.868
that I've never performed
in my entire life.

1988
01:29:11.868 --> 01:29:14.479
and Blaze here is
my little assistant. okay?

1989
01:29:14.479 --> 01:29:17.743
And basically. I'm going to
make him disappear! All right?

1990
01:29:17.743 --> 01:29:19.615
So. I actually need
your guys' help.

1991
01:29:19.615 --> 01:29:21.834
and on the count of three.

1992
01:29:22.487 --> 01:29:24.402
One...

1993
01:29:24.402 --> 01:29:26.230
two...

1994
01:29:26.230 --> 01:29:27.144
three.

1995
01:29:27.710 --> 01:29:29.886
Get the fuck out!

1996
01:29:31.844 --> 01:29:32.976
Man...

1997
01:29:34.281 --> 01:29:35.370
Yeah!

1998
01:29:37.676 --> 01:29:40.810
All right. so. now that
that's out the way.

1999
01:29:40.810 --> 01:29:42.725
I think it's time
to get some real magic.

2000
01:29:42.725 --> 01:29:44.509
What you all think?
You all think that's cool?

2001
01:29:46.642 --> 01:29:47.904
All right.

2002
01:29:50.602 --> 01:29:52.474
<i> And just like that.
my baby performed</i>

2003
01:29:52.474 --> 01:29:54.389
<i>his first Vegas magic show.</i>

2004
01:29:54.824 --> 01:29:57.479
<i>Meanwhile. outside.
Blaze was about to get clowned.</i>

2005
01:29:57.479 --> 01:29:59.045
Boim!

2006
01:30:00.090 --> 01:30:01.352
Boim!

2007
01:30:02.135 --> 01:30:02.919
Boink!

2008
01:30:05.704 --> 01:30:07.314
Hey. look. guys.
I don't do free handouts.

2009
01:30:07.314 --> 01:30:10.666
We don't want your money.
We just saw your act.

2010
01:30:11.188 --> 01:30:13.190
Let me tell you. it sucked.

2011
01:30:13.190 --> 01:30:16.019
I just wanted to come out here
and give you a joke.

2012
01:30:16.019 --> 01:30:21.111
What did the bowling pin
say to the balls?

2013
01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:22.852
I don't... I don't know.

2014
01:30:22.852 --> 01:30:24.984
Welcome to the club!

2015
01:30:26.551 --> 01:30:28.118
That's clown life. baby!

2016
01:30:40.173 --> 01:30:42.828
<i> I'm telling you.
my baby was a star.</i>

2017
01:30:44.003 --> 01:30:46.179
<i>It was a night
he always dreamed of.</i>

2018
01:30:46.179 --> 01:30:48.268
<i>Everybody was feeling the love!</i>

2019
01:30:52.403 --> 01:30:54.579
<i>Well. everybody except Merlin.</i>

2020
01:30:55.362 --> 01:30:58.191
<i>Because even though
he killed it onstage.</i>

2021
01:30:58.191 --> 01:31:00.280
<i>he had lost Robin</i>

2022
01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:02.195
<i>and found out who his dad
really was</i>

2023
01:31:02.195 --> 01:31:03.501
<i>all in one night.</i>

2024
01:31:05.503 --> 01:31:07.679
<i>So. the whole thing
was kind of bittersweet.</i>

2025
01:31:10.290 --> 01:31:13.903
<i>And so. by the next morning.
he was just...</i>

2026
01:31:13.903 --> 01:31:14.773
<i>bitter!</i>

2027
01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:24.522
Let me guess;
it's for your migraines?

2028
01:31:24.522 --> 01:31:26.611
No. I'm getting high.

2029
01:31:26.611 --> 01:31:29.309
I invited the guys here
to celebrate.

2030
01:31:29.309 --> 01:31:30.833
I'm selling the hotel.

2031
01:31:30.833 --> 01:31:33.575
When my buyer saw us packing in
that house.

2032
01:31:33.575 --> 01:31:35.185
they stopped lowballing me.

2033
01:31:35.185 --> 01:31:37.317
I'm going to be
a rich old bitch!

2034
01:31:38.841 --> 01:31:40.625
That's good. Miss Rita.
That's real good.

2035
01:31:40.625 --> 01:31:43.019
I'm glad reviving the Chips
worked out for you.

2036
01:31:43.019 --> 01:31:45.935
because it sure came back
to bite me in my ass.

2037
01:31:45.935 --> 01:31:49.242
Yeah. I heard what happened.
I'm sorry.

2038
01:31:49.242 --> 01:31:52.985
But I heard your magic show
kicked ass.

2039
01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:55.640
I also heard about
your little family reunion.

2040
01:31:56.293 --> 01:31:57.903
You better go talk to Luther.

2041
01:31:57.903 --> 01:32:00.210
You've been around him enough
to know that he's a good man.

2042
01:32:00.210 --> 01:32:01.864
Yeah. he is.

2043
01:32:03.735 --> 01:32:06.172
Everyone deserves
a second chance.

2044
01:32:20.926 --> 01:32:23.320
<i> Hey. baby.
we need to talk.</i>

2045
01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:25.191
<i>I know you're hurting.
so don't shut me out.</i>

2046
01:32:25.191 --> 01:32:26.584
<i>Okay. look...</i>

2047
01:32:26.976 --> 01:32:28.630
Don't take it out
on your momma. Son.

2048
01:32:29.021 --> 01:32:30.545
Oh. so. what. it's Son now?

2049
01:32:30.545 --> 01:32:32.372
Okay. whatever
you want it to be. kid.

2050
01:32:33.330 --> 01:32:36.638
Listen. I'm just saying don't
take it out on Verna. all right?

2051
01:32:37.639 --> 01:32:39.597
I was wild when
we started dancing.

2052
01:32:39.597 --> 01:32:42.426
The Chips started blowing
up and blew up quick!

2053
01:32:42.426 --> 01:32:45.603
I mean. temptation
was everywhere.

2054
01:32:45.603 --> 01:32:47.257
And I fell all in it.

2055
01:32:49.172 --> 01:32:52.567
Your momma. she was. you know...
She got hurt and so she left me.

2056
01:32:52.567 --> 01:32:54.917
took off to LA
I wanted to find her.

2057
01:32:55.526 --> 01:32:58.311
I wanted to say. you know.
"Verna. give me another chance."

2058
01:32:58.311 --> 01:32:59.574
- Yeah. sure you did.

2059
01:32:59.574 --> 01:33:01.271
Oh. if I'm lying. I'm dying.

2060
01:33:01.271 --> 01:33:02.707
Lookie here.

2061
01:33:02.707 --> 01:33:04.013
I even got her a proper ring.

2062
01:33:05.101 --> 01:33:06.842
She deserved it.

2063
01:33:06.842 --> 01:33:09.801
and I wanted to make up
for my past mistakes.

2064
01:33:09.801 --> 01:33:12.674
You know. I wrecked
my car and my leg. and...

2065
01:33:13.936 --> 01:33:15.415
...it took a lot out of me.

2066
01:33:16.242 --> 01:33:18.462
I mean. I was young and dumb.

2067
01:33:19.942 --> 01:33:21.770
Well. age ain't made you
no smarter.

2068
01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:26.644
Okay. I'll take that.
I'll take that.

2069
01:33:26.644 --> 01:33:29.734
But who's being
the dumb one now?

2070
01:33:30.605 --> 01:33:32.041
Hm?

2071
01:33:32.041 --> 01:33:35.392
I know what a mistake it is
to lose the right woman.

2072
01:33:36.132 --> 01:33:38.656
I just don't want that
to happen to you.

2073
01:33:38.656 --> 01:33:41.224
So. you think I should chase
after Robin?

2074
01:33:41.659 --> 01:33:43.443
Well. she ain't chasing
after you.

2075
01:33:44.009 --> 01:33:46.316
<i> Merlin. there's a girl
in the Cookie Club</i>

2076
01:33:46.316 --> 01:33:47.622
<i>here for you.</i>

2077
01:33:48.666 --> 01:33:52.278
Don't be so sure
about that. Pops.

2078
01:33:54.933 --> 01:33:56.848
Hey. hey. hey. guys.

2079
01:33:56.848 --> 01:33:58.284
Uh. what's up?

2080
01:33:58.284 --> 01:34:00.112
Is there like a girl here
or something. for me?

2081
01:34:00.112 --> 01:34:01.461
Yep. right there.

2082
01:34:05.727 --> 01:34:07.859
- Hi. Merlin.
- Hey. Gia.

2083
01:34:07.859 --> 01:34:09.861
Look. I don't have
a lot of time.

2084
01:34:09.861 --> 01:34:13.473
but I wanted to say I'm sorry
about last night.

2085
01:34:14.605 --> 01:34:15.780
I took the video.

2086
01:34:15.780 --> 01:34:18.261
but I didn't know
what he was up to.

2087
01:34:18.740 --> 01:34:21.699
You seem really nice.
and I know you care about Robin.

2088
01:34:21.699 --> 01:34:25.660
so I felt like
you should know...

2089
01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:26.922
they're getting married today.

2090
01:34:28.358 --> 01:34:30.534
Seems Blaze got it in his head

2091
01:34:30.534 --> 01:34:32.579
to surprise her
with some resort wedding

2092
01:34:32.579 --> 01:34:33.711
away from the strip.

2093
01:34:34.973 --> 01:34:37.497
Unless someone wants
to speak up.

2094
01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:40.283
So. what you going to do.
Mr. Magic?

2095
01:34:40.283 --> 01:34:42.024
What you going to do?
- I don't know. Luther.

2096
01:34:42.024 --> 01:34:43.199
I can't stop a wedding
by myself.

2097
01:34:43.199 --> 01:34:44.156
Can't. can't. boy!

2098
01:34:44.156 --> 01:34:45.418
I told you about
that word can't!

2099
01:34:45.418 --> 01:34:46.419
There's no such thing.

2100
01:34:46.419 --> 01:34:48.378
And you're not by yourself.

2101
01:34:48.378 --> 01:34:50.554
Your brothers got your back.
Boop!

2102
01:34:50.554 --> 01:34:51.729
All right. well. thanks. guys.

2103
01:34:51.729 --> 01:34:52.948
but it's not like
we got invited.

2104
01:34:52.948 --> 01:34:54.776
How are we going to get them
to let us in?

2105
01:34:54.776 --> 01:34:58.301
I wonder;
have they hired a pastor yet?

2106
01:34:58.301 --> 01:34:59.737
Yeah. it wasn't hard in Vegas.

2107
01:34:59.737 --> 01:35:01.391
I'm about to confirm one
for Blaze now.

2108
01:35:01.391 --> 01:35:04.829
Ah. ah. ah. baby girl!
You just found one!

2109
01:35:04.829 --> 01:35:06.570
And a security team.

2110
01:35:06.570 --> 01:35:08.877
like we used to do
for Luther's old routine.

2111
01:35:08.877 --> 01:35:11.227
But only if Mr. Big is in.

2112
01:35:11.227 --> 01:35:13.664
How about it?
Ready to get back on your feet?

2113
01:35:13.664 --> 01:35:15.797
Huh? Well. it has been a long time

2114
01:35:15.797 --> 01:35:17.581
since I've been out the game. so...

2115
01:35:17.581 --> 01:35:20.279
Hell yeah. I'm in!
Let's go do what we do.

2116
01:35:24.501 --> 01:35:26.198
Please just put that away. okay?

2117
01:35:26.198 --> 01:35:28.113
I'm only coming to whatever
this surprise is

2118
01:35:28.113 --> 01:35:31.116
because I feel bad you got
jumped by a motorcycle gang.

2119
01:35:31.116 --> 01:35:33.031
I'm still mad at you for
what you did to Merlin.

2120
01:35:33.031 --> 01:35:34.772
<i>Hey. it wasn't me who
lied to you. okay?</i>

2121
01:35:35.773 --> 01:35:37.383
<i>Now. trust me.
you're going to love this!</i>

2122
01:35:37.383 --> 01:35:40.082
Get in. After you. After you.
my love. come on.

2123
01:35:40.082 --> 01:35:41.692
<i>She's going to love this.</i>

2124
01:35:42.214 --> 01:35:43.259
It's going to be great!

2125
01:35:45.783 --> 01:35:48.220
Mom. hey. hey. mom.
<i> You okay. baby?</i>

2126
01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:49.569
I'm riding back to the airport.

2127
01:35:49.569 --> 01:35:51.136
but I can turn around
if you need me to.

2128
01:35:51.136 --> 01:35:52.747
No. it's fine. And you know.

2129
01:35:52.747 --> 01:35:54.226
I can't even really talk
about that right now.

2130
01:35:54.226 --> 01:35:55.924
The guys are waiting
for me outside.

2131
01:35:55.924 --> 01:35:57.752
<i>But Robin is getting
married today...</i>

2132
01:35:57.752 --> 01:36:02.147
and look. I'm thinking about
trying to stop it.

2133
01:36:02.582 --> 01:36:03.888
What the hell. Merlin?

2134
01:36:03.888 --> 01:36:06.238
Yeah. I know it sounds crazy.
right? I know.

2135
01:36:07.022 --> 01:36:09.024
Ain't nothing crazy
about love.

2136
01:36:09.502 --> 01:36:11.809
Hell. I've been feeling
a little crazy

2137
01:36:11.809 --> 01:36:13.680
after seeing Luther last night.

2138
01:36:14.072 --> 01:36:16.640
<i>We all need a little
crazy sometimes.</i>

2139
01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:18.555
Go get your girl.

2140
01:36:19.295 --> 01:36:22.124
I will. Yeah. I will.
I will. mom.

2141
01:36:22.777 --> 01:36:24.779
I love you.
I love you. thank you.

2142
01:36:27.172 --> 01:36:28.217
Uh...

2143
01:36:28.217 --> 01:36:30.393
Driver.
Can you pull over

2144
01:36:30.393 --> 01:36:31.829
so I can change clothes?

2145
01:36:31.829 --> 01:36:32.961
Close your eyes. though.

2146
01:36:32.961 --> 01:36:34.440
You know what?

2147
01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:35.920
You ain't got
to close your eyes.

2148
01:36:38.096 --> 01:36:40.098
<i>So. Merlin texts me
the address</i>

2149
01:36:40.098 --> 01:36:42.361
<i>and then got ready
to go get his girl back</i>

2150
01:36:42.361 --> 01:36:45.060
<i>while Blaze had other plans.</i>

2151
01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:46.713
<i>But just like
I been telling y'all.</i>

2152
01:36:46.713 --> 01:36:48.846
<i>plans don't always come true.</i>

2153
01:36:48.846 --> 01:36:51.849
<i>Because it was
about to pop off!</i>

2154
01:36:51.849 --> 01:36:53.808
- Oh my God!
- Mm-hmm!

2155
01:36:53.808 --> 01:36:57.289
- Blaze. what is this?
- Yep. Surprise.

2156
01:36:57.289 --> 01:36:58.987
It's your dream wedding.
girl. right?

2157
01:36:59.988 --> 01:37:01.467
Oh my God!

2158
01:37:01.467 --> 01:37:03.513
This is a little more you.
you know what I mean?

2159
01:37:03.513 --> 01:37:05.123
- Yeah.
- It's. like. intimate.

2160
01:37:05.123 --> 01:37:08.300
I even had a gown
made by a local designer

2161
01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:10.868
because I wanted to match
your spiritualness...

2162
01:37:10.868 --> 01:37:12.609
- Oh my God!
- ...and your natural beauty.

2163
01:37:12.609 --> 01:37:14.698
Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah. it's...

2164
01:37:14.698 --> 01:37:17.135
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

2165
01:37:17.701 --> 01:37:19.007
Surprise.

2166
01:37:19.007 --> 01:37:20.747
Blaze. I never knew
you knew me this well.

2167
01:37:20.747 --> 01:37:22.837
Oh. I know you.
Hell. yeah.

2168
01:37:22.837 --> 01:37:24.403
Now all you gotta do
is get dressed.

2169
01:37:24.403 --> 01:37:26.231
and walk down that aisle

2170
01:37:26.231 --> 01:37:27.754
and say those two magic words.

2171
01:37:27.754 --> 01:37:29.800
There's the dress. Look at that.

2172
01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:32.890
Gia! What are you doing here?
I am absolutely shocked!

2173
01:37:32.890 --> 01:37:34.370
I need to take
a picture of that.

2174
01:37:34.370 --> 01:37:35.762
This is beautiful!

2175
01:37:35.762 --> 01:37:37.503
Oh. girl. you ain't seen
nothing yet.

2176
01:37:37.503 --> 01:37:38.722
Let's go. come on.

2177
01:37:38.722 --> 01:37:40.289
- Where are we going?
- To go get ready.

2178
01:37:40.289 --> 01:37:41.551
I'm going to see
you later. baby.

2179
01:37:41.551 --> 01:37:42.639
- Bye. babe!
- Yeah.

2180
01:37:42.639 --> 01:37:43.553
Where are we going?

2181
01:37:43.553 --> 01:37:44.641
Hey! Where's my suit at?

2182
01:37:44.641 --> 01:37:45.860
You sure I look good?

2183
01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:47.774
This look good?
- You look great.

2184
01:37:51.474 --> 01:37:52.867
Okay. um...

2185
01:37:54.607 --> 01:37:56.218
I'm going to need some
time alone with Robin.

2186
01:37:56.218 --> 01:37:58.176
but I can't get to her
with Blaze around.

2187
01:37:58.176 --> 01:38:00.178
So. look. I'm going
to need a distraction.

2188
01:38:00.178 --> 01:38:02.572
Listen. boy. the one thing the
Chips know how to do

2189
01:38:02.572 --> 01:38:04.269
is distract people.

2190
01:38:04.269 --> 01:38:06.489
Hell yeah. let's do it!
Look at us!

2191
01:38:06.489 --> 01:38:08.752
We got on Luther's old outfits.

2192
01:38:08.752 --> 01:38:10.406
And Luther's old music.

2193
01:38:12.538 --> 01:38:14.671
Yeah. but do we get
the old Luther?

2194
01:38:15.498 --> 01:38:18.109
Hell. yeah.
It's showtime. fellas.

2195
01:38:19.894 --> 01:38:21.504
Luther's back!

2196
01:38:23.985 --> 01:38:26.204
Let them through.
please. okay?

2197
01:38:26.204 --> 01:38:28.990
This is the Pastor and
the groom's personal security.

2198
01:38:28.990 --> 01:38:30.469
Blaze is expecting them.

2199
01:38:30.469 --> 01:38:32.384
That's all you have to say.
All right. let's go.

2200
01:38:36.171 --> 01:38:37.476
Thank you.

2201
01:38:38.608 --> 01:38:40.175
- We back.
- We back.

2202
01:38:45.484 --> 01:38:47.095
You can do this. Robin.

2203
01:38:47.095 --> 01:38:49.445
All you have to do is say
those two magic words.

2204
01:38:50.968 --> 01:38:53.666
It's only magic if it's true.

2205
01:38:55.277 --> 01:38:57.453
Merlin?
What are you doing here?

2206
01:38:57.453 --> 01:38:59.672
Look. I'm stopping you
from marrying the wrong guy.

2207
01:38:59.672 --> 01:39:01.239
You're about to make
a big mistake. Robin.

2208
01:39:01.239 --> 01:39:04.286
No. the only mistake I made
was believing you.

2209
01:39:04.286 --> 01:39:05.809
Here I was doubting Blaze.

2210
01:39:05.809 --> 01:39:07.811
but it turns out it's you
I can't trust.

2211
01:39:07.811 --> 01:39:09.247
You can't trust me?

2212
01:39:09.247 --> 01:39:11.510
Meanwhile. Blaze knew me
better all along.

2213
01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:12.729
I mean. look at this wedding.

2214
01:39:13.556 --> 01:39:15.166
No. he didn't.

2215
01:39:18.561 --> 01:39:21.781
Where were you.
and why are you so hot?

2216
01:39:21.781 --> 01:39:24.349
I'm cool. I'm cool!
Super cool.

2217
01:39:24.349 --> 01:39:25.829
Yeah. but it's about
to get hotter.

2218
01:39:25.829 --> 01:39:27.091
Well. hello. Hello.

2219
01:39:28.179 --> 01:39:30.703
Hey. now. Hey. people.

2220
01:39:31.704 --> 01:39:32.923
Who's this guy?

2221
01:39:32.923 --> 01:39:35.926
Hold up. Hello. hello.

2222
01:39:35.926 --> 01:39:37.710
- He's the pastor.
- This the person you hired?

2223
01:39:37.710 --> 01:39:39.495
Yes. yeah. no. trust me.
he's huge in Vegas.

2224
01:39:39.974 --> 01:39:42.454
Hello! Girl...

2225
01:39:43.803 --> 01:39:45.936
He does not look
like a Pastor.

2226
01:39:45.936 --> 01:39:47.982
Yeah. hey.

2227
01:39:47.982 --> 01:39:50.506
Good people. we came together
today so that we can join

2228
01:39:50.506 --> 01:39:52.943
two people who are destined
to be together.

2229
01:39:53.509 --> 01:39:56.947
That's a love
that cannot be denied.

2230
01:39:58.340 --> 01:40:00.124
It's a beautiful thing.
it's a special thing.

2231
01:40:00.124 --> 01:40:01.647
It's a special day.

2232
01:40:01.647 --> 01:40:03.954
It's a special day for me.
it's a special day for her.

2233
01:40:03.954 --> 01:40:05.477
It's a special day for him.

2234
01:40:05.477 --> 01:40:07.610
It's a special day for you!

2235
01:40:08.872 --> 01:40:10.004
It's a special day for humans!

2236
01:40:10.004 --> 01:40:11.701
- Amen!
- Amen!

2237
01:40:11.701 --> 01:40:13.442
- Yeah!

2238
01:40:14.269 --> 01:40:16.619
Yeah. because. you know.
make no mistake about it.

2239
01:40:16.619 --> 01:40:19.100
I done made some big mistakes.
let me tell you.

2240
01:40:19.100 --> 01:40:21.493
Let me tell you.
I lost the woman

2241
01:40:21.493 --> 01:40:23.017
that I cared for the most.

2242
01:40:23.887 --> 01:40:25.062
It's terrible when
you make a mistake

2243
01:40:25.062 --> 01:40:26.281
and you lose your soulmate.

2244
01:40:26.281 --> 01:40:29.240
If you got somebody
that you love.

2245
01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:30.850
hold on to them tight!

2246
01:40:31.938 --> 01:40:33.288
Tight!

2247
01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:36.552
You understand me?
Make sure you...

2248
01:40:37.727 --> 01:40:40.034
Make sure you find somebody
that got your back.

2249
01:40:40.773 --> 01:40:41.992
Yeah.

2250
01:40:42.514 --> 01:40:44.690
Because when the chips are down.

2251
01:40:44.690 --> 01:40:46.257
the Chips are never out.

2252
01:40:46.257 --> 01:40:48.085
So. listen here. good people.

2253
01:40:48.085 --> 01:40:49.826
When you find somebody.

2254
01:40:49.826 --> 01:40:52.742
and if you're lucky enough
to find somebody that loves you.

2255
01:40:52.742 --> 01:40:55.049
you better jump on it!

2256
01:40:55.658 --> 01:40:56.963
Jump on it!

2257
01:41:10.847 --> 01:41:12.892
I told him everything.
I told him what you like!

2258
01:41:12.892 --> 01:41:14.938
This is me. This wedding is me.

2259
01:41:14.938 --> 01:41:16.418
Wait...

2260
01:41:16.418 --> 01:41:17.506
Wait. wait. wait.
So. you're saying

2261
01:41:17.506 --> 01:41:19.377
all of this was your idea?
- Yes.

2262
01:41:19.377 --> 01:41:21.118
- You told Blaze for me.
- Yes. Robin!

2263
01:41:21.118 --> 01:41:22.554
So. who am I supposed
to marry. you?

2264
01:41:22.554 --> 01:41:23.990
Yeah.

2265
01:41:26.428 --> 01:41:29.387
It's not a damn TV show.
You got to go!

2266
01:41:29.387 --> 01:41:31.128
So. I'm the bad guy now?

2267
01:41:31.128 --> 01:41:33.913
How can I believe
anything you say anymore?

2268
01:41:33.913 --> 01:41:35.741
I'm done. like.
I'm done with this. No. don't.

2269
01:41:35.741 --> 01:41:37.787
Robin. come on.

2270
01:41:39.745 --> 01:41:40.877
Robin.

2271
01:41:50.016 --> 01:41:51.888
Can you stop?
Can you all stop?

2272
01:41:51.888 --> 01:41:53.498
Can you all stop?
Can you stop this?

2273
01:41:55.457 --> 01:41:57.328
Come on. Robin.
let me just talk to you!

2274
01:41:57.328 --> 01:41:58.634
Son of a bitch!

2275
01:42:07.773 --> 01:42:09.819
I don't even mean it
like that!

2276
01:42:09.819 --> 01:42:11.473
Well. I did mean it
like that. but just...

2277
01:42:11.473 --> 01:42:13.039
- Robin!
- Hey. hey. hey!

2278
01:42:13.649 --> 01:42:15.868
Hey. Frank. film this.

2279
01:42:15.868 --> 01:42:17.522
I'm about to kick
this motherfucker's ass.

2280
01:42:17.522 --> 01:42:19.263
Get me in the shot. come on.

2281
01:42:19.263 --> 01:42:20.569
I'm going to kick
this motherfucker's ass

2282
01:42:20.569 --> 01:42:21.570
for crashing my wedding!

2283
01:42:33.190 --> 01:42:35.714
You know how it is.
You remember?

2284
01:42:39.805 --> 01:42:41.590
I got you smiling again.

2285
01:42:43.069 --> 01:42:45.115
Why don't you tell her
who told you what she wanted?

2286
01:42:45.115 --> 01:42:47.204
Man. shut. man. shut up.
Get this. Shut up. okay?

2287
01:42:47.204 --> 01:42:49.293
No one's going to believe you.
because he's a clown. okay?

2288
01:42:49.293 --> 01:42:52.253
I'm a clown. Who gives...
Yo. I'm a stripper. too.

2289
01:42:52.253 --> 01:42:53.732
Hell. I'm even a liar!

2290
01:42:53.732 --> 01:42:55.821
But you know what I'm not?
I'm not a fake!

2291
01:42:55.821 --> 01:42:58.215
You don't love her like I do.
- I'm the one she's marrying.

2292
01:42:58.215 --> 01:43:00.609
Boy. you got these cameras
going all the time.

2293
01:43:00.609 --> 01:43:01.653
It's all just one big act!

2294
01:43:01.653 --> 01:43:03.394
You about to hear my vows. bro.

2295
01:43:03.394 --> 01:43:05.831
Wedding vows? Let me tell you
the wedding vows that I wrote.

2296
01:43:05.831 --> 01:43:09.052
"Do you. Robin.
take me. Merlin...

2297
01:43:09.052 --> 01:43:10.880
<i>to be my first kiss?</i>

2298
01:43:11.663 --> 01:43:15.319
<i>To make magic with me.
to watch old tv shows together?</i>

2299
01:43:15.319 --> 01:43:17.800
<i>To always make
each other laugh.</i>

2300
01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:19.758
<i>to always have
each other's backs?"</i>

2301
01:43:20.803 --> 01:43:23.371
See. because she is my Whitley.

2302
01:43:23.371 --> 01:43:24.502
And I'm in love with her.

2303
01:43:24.502 --> 01:43:26.156
I'm in love with you. too.
Merlin!

2304
01:43:26.678 --> 01:43:27.810
Wait.
what did she just say?

2305
01:43:30.639 --> 01:43:32.728
- Merlin.
- Did you mean it?

2306
01:43:32.728 --> 01:43:34.208
Of course.

2307
01:43:38.124 --> 01:43:42.216
I love you. Merlin. so much.
- Yeah. I know.

2308
01:43:42.216 --> 01:43:43.739
And unlike him...

2309
01:43:43.739 --> 01:43:45.741
I was going to Blaze her
ass at the altar. anyway.

2310
01:43:45.741 --> 01:43:48.700
...I know you.

2311
01:43:52.791 --> 01:43:54.402
You know?

2312
01:44:03.237 --> 01:44:06.762
Will Robin marry Merlin?

2313
01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:10.635
I mean. is this what
you want. Merlin?

2314
01:44:11.549 --> 01:44:13.203
I want a different world.

2315
01:44:14.378 --> 01:44:15.640
Do you?

2316
01:44:16.075 --> 01:44:17.251
I do.

2317
01:44:18.687 --> 01:44:21.080
Wow. those words
really are magic.

2318
01:44:22.734 --> 01:44:25.084
Well. then...

2319
01:44:25.084 --> 01:44:29.132
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

2320
01:44:30.220 --> 01:44:31.526
You may kiss the bride.

2321
01:44:38.707 --> 01:44:41.013
<i> See. just like
when I get a massage.</i>

2322
01:44:41.013 --> 01:44:43.320
<i>my tale had a happy ending.</i>

2323
01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:44.800
<i>Merlin got his girl.</i>

2324
01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:47.455
<i>somehow Robin magically
got my damn wedding ring</i>

2325
01:44:47.455 --> 01:44:49.413
<i>with that little ass diamond.</i>

2326
01:44:49.413 --> 01:44:51.154
<i>Luther finally got to be a dad.</i>

2327
01:44:51.154 --> 01:44:52.808
<i>and we buried the hatchet.</i>

2328
01:44:52.808 --> 01:44:56.681
<i>And by hatchet.
I mean his dick in my vagina!</i>

2329
01:44:56.681 --> 01:44:58.030
We're going to go ahead

2330
01:44:58.030 --> 01:44:59.597
and make you a little sister
or brother. okay?

2331
01:44:59.597 --> 01:45:01.077
Momma. really?

2332
01:45:01.077 --> 01:45:02.818
I got about four eggs left.

2333
01:45:02.818 --> 01:45:03.949
I'm going to scramble
everything!

2334
01:45:03.949 --> 01:45:06.996
So. husband.
are you retired now?

2335
01:45:06.996 --> 01:45:09.346
From stripping?
Yeah. absolutely.

2336
01:45:10.391 --> 01:45:12.044
What if I want you
to dance for me?

2337
01:45:12.044 --> 01:45:13.437
What you mean. like...

2338
01:45:13.437 --> 01:45:14.612
I mean. that can be arranged.

2339
01:45:14.612 --> 01:45:15.918
Back in the hotel room. later?

2340
01:45:15.918 --> 01:45:18.790
Uh-uh! Uh-uh!
What if I want it right now?

2341
01:45:18.790 --> 01:45:20.618
- Right now?
- DJ!

2342
01:45:21.358 --> 01:45:23.404
Robin. don't do this to me.

2343
01:45:23.404 --> 01:45:26.145
Ladies and gentlemen. I'd like
to bring to the stage right now

2344
01:45:26.145 --> 01:45:31.107
Dr. X. Mr. Body. Mr. Face.

2345
01:45:31.107 --> 01:45:34.632
Mr. Slim Sexy. Mr. Big.

Mr. Black Magic!

2347

Ladies and gentlemen. I bring
to you the Chocolate Chips!

2348
01:45:55.610 --> 01:45:57.307
<i> Like I said.
Merlin and Robin</i>

2349
01:45:57.307 --> 01:46:00.092
<i>have been crazy about
each other from day one.</i>

2350
01:46:00.092 --> 01:46:01.964
<i>So. while we get our dance on.</i>

2351
01:46:01.964 --> 01:46:04.532
<i>it's time to let them get to
the best part of the wedding.</i>

2352
01:46:04.532 --> 01:46:06.142
<i>the honeymoon!</i>

2353
01:46:06.142 --> 01:46:08.405
<i>You all know I meant fucking.
right?</i>

2354
01:46:08.405 --> 01:46:11.103
So. come on. here's to love.

2355
01:46:11.103 --> 01:46:12.757
<i>Here's to the future.</i>

2356
01:46:12.757 --> 01:46:14.455
<i>Here's to magic.</i>

2357
01:46:20.156 --> 01:46:22.158
Raise your hand
if you fought a tiger.

2358
01:46:26.597 --> 01:46:28.512
- Bam!
- Hit them with it.

2359
01:46:28.512 --> 01:46:30.253
- Bam!
- Double it up.

2360
01:46:30.253 --> 01:46:31.863
Who's talking? Who's talking?

2361
01:46:34.779 --> 01:46:36.390
Well. come on in here.

2362
01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:39.697
By the time you get in here.
I'll be on the stage butt naked.

2363
01:46:46.617 --> 01:46:47.792
I heard it.

2364
01:46:57.454 --> 01:47:00.501
Good living and good pussy.

2365
01:47:03.460 --> 01:47:04.853
Stop messing around. Merlin.

2366
01:47:04.853 --> 01:47:06.550
Okay. I'm not messing
around! I'm stuck.

2367
01:47:06.550 --> 01:47:08.944
Oh. shit. Robin?

2368
01:47:08.944 --> 01:47:09.858
Help!

2369
01:47:12.817 --> 01:47:14.645
Amen. talk about the Lord!

2370
01:47:18.301 --> 01:47:20.390
Get... wrong way!

2371
01:47:21.957 --> 01:47:23.088
Cut!

2372
01:47:23.567 --> 01:47:25.395
Yo. how do you open this door?

2373
01:47:25.395 --> 01:47:26.527
Use your dick.

2374
01:47:31.575 --> 01:47:33.664
Earl said. "Well. yeah.
I'm not where I should be."

2375
01:47:33.664 --> 01:47:35.013
I said. "Don't show me.

2376
01:47:35.013 --> 01:47:36.667
but if you could give me
an example."

2377
01:47:36.667 --> 01:47:38.800
Well. Earl sent me
a goddamn cup!

2378
01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:41.411
Yeah. So Earl's dealing
with a fucking sardine.

2379
01:47:42.107 --> 01:47:44.414
Shake it. shake it.
shake it. shake it.

2380
01:47:44.893 --> 01:47:48.200
Huh! Baby.
talk about the Lord!

2381
01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:50.986
You see these calves?
Ladies love them.

2382
01:47:50.986 --> 01:47:52.553
Can't get them at the gym.

2383
01:47:52.553 --> 01:47:54.424
Literally you can't.
They're implants.

2384
01:47:54.424 --> 01:47:56.557
Talking. who's talking?
I'm talking.

2385
01:47:56.557 --> 01:47:58.602
Who's working?
I'm working.

2386
01:47:58.602 --> 01:48:00.343
It should be two. then slide.

2387
01:48:00.343 --> 01:48:01.605
That's what I was trying
to tell...

2388
01:48:01.605 --> 01:48:04.434
See? Perky. right?

2389
01:48:05.348 --> 01:48:07.393
Maybe you need
a second opinion.

2390
01:48:07.916 --> 01:48:11.702
Jesus. Bambi! Stop having guys
put their hands on your tits!

2391
01:48:11.702 --> 01:48:13.530
Took that orangutan! Huh!

2392
01:48:19.754 --> 01:48:21.451
You wanna come back
to the party with me?

2393
01:48:21.451 --> 01:48:23.584
Hell. nah. I got plans.

2394
01:48:23.584 --> 01:48:26.935
Huh? They want to do
all that right there? Huh?

2395
01:48:26.935 --> 01:48:28.937
Get the hell up out
of my back door!

2396
01:48:28.937 --> 01:48:30.765
The fuck do you think this is?

2397
01:48:30.765 --> 01:48:32.157
Did we get it right?

2398
01:48:34.333 --> 01:48:35.552
All right. all right.
all right.

2399
01:48:35.552 --> 01:48:36.814
Sit your asses down!

2400
01:48:36.814 --> 01:48:38.424
Say it again.

2401
01:56:07.525 --> 01:56:09.614
difuze
