I wanna be punished.

00:00:33.117 --> 00:00:35.995
I fantasize about being gang raped.

Did you think about what we
talked about the other night?

17
00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:57.933
- Do you really think I can
get acting and modeling work?

18
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.602
- Are you kidding me?

19
00:00:59.602 --> 00:01:01.687
Girl. look in the mirror.

20
00:01:01.687 --> 00:01:03.355
You're sexy as fuck.

21
00:01:04.482 --> 00:01:06.775
Okay. do you remember all of your lines?

22
00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:09.278
I need you to do all of them this time.

23
00:01:09.278 --> 00:01:10.320
- [Hope] Yup.

24
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.988

25
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.075
Action.

26
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.785
- I'm a very bad girl.

27
00:01:20.748 --> 00:01:23.250
- What the hell are you doing?

28
00:01:25.628 --> 00:01:28.588
I heard you talking
about getting gang raped.

29
00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:30.340
- You were listening?

30
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.928
What kind of creepy psycho are you?

31
00:01:33.928 --> 00:01:35.845
- Who were you talking to?

32
00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:37.807
I heard a female voice.

33
00:01:37.807 --> 00:01:40.392
- None of your business.

34
00:01:40.392 --> 00:01:41.935
You're not my mom.

35
00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:44.313
- Were you sex talking with a woman?

36
00:01:44.313 --> 00:01:46.107
Are you gay?

37
00:01:46.107 --> 00:01:49.527
What the hell is going on with you. Hope?

38
00:01:52.655 --> 00:01:55.157
- Get away from me. you bitch!

39
00:02:10.713 --> 00:02:11.548
- Vodka?

40
00:02:15.928 --> 00:02:17.303
Look at you.

41
00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:20.265
What kind of a slut are you?

42
00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:22.725
I'm telling your father.

43
00:02:22.725 --> 00:02:23.560
- Get out.

44
00:02:25.688 --> 00:02:27.273
- You're so stupid.

45
00:02:37.533 --> 00:02:38.908
- [Dad] Who were you talking to earlier??

46
00:02:38.908 --> 00:02:41.203
- It was just Paige. dad.

47
00:02:41.203 --> 00:02:42.370
- Who's Paige?

48
00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:45.958
- She used to babysit for us.

49
00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.793
- [Stepmom] She was practically
naked and drinking alcohol.

50
00:02:48.793 --> 00:02:50.670
That's not okay.

51
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.715
- She's like a sister to me.

52
00:02:52.715 --> 00:02:53.883
It's nothing.

53
00:02:53.883 --> 00:02:55.633
God. give me a break.

54
00:02:56.802 --> 00:03:00.680
- She was talking about
getting gang raped.

55
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.808
- Why are you doing this to me?

56
00:03:03.808 --> 00:03:05.810
- It's okay. let her go.

57
00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:07.563
Here.

58
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.900

00:03:56.737 --> 00:04:00.073
(police sirens ringing)

60
00:04:04.912 --> 00:04:06.247
- Hey. nice to see you man.
- Yes sir.

61
00:04:06.247 --> 00:04:07.330
- That's right. Dougie.

62
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.000
(drums beating)

63
00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:18.258
- Welcome to Hollywood.
would you have a ride?

64
00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:20.928
(drums beating)

65
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.933
- I can't fucking believe this.

66
00:04:25.933 --> 00:04:28.268
Are you seriously firing me?

67
00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:29.353
- Licia.

68
00:04:29.353 --> 00:04:31.938
we can't have girls beating
the crap out of each other.

69
00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:34.733
- That cunt stole my customer

70
00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:35.818
and then told me to suck a dick.

71
00:04:35.818 --> 00:04:38.278
am I supposed to just
let shit like that slide?

72
00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:41.198
(foreign language)

73
00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:44.158
- Fuck.

74
00:04:45.868 --> 00:04:46.703
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.373
I have a kid.

76
00:04:52.835 --> 00:04:55.628
Please just let me just finish my shift.

77
00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:57.588
I'm behind my rent.

78
00:04:57.588 --> 00:05:00.508
(foreign language)

79
00:05:02.928 --> 00:05:05.263
Please. don't do this to me.

80
00:05:06.807 --> 00:05:10.018
- If we let you work. everyone's
gonna think it's okay.

81
00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:12.103
- Fuck you and fuck you.

82
00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:14.565
Yeah. you can kiss my fucking black ass.

83
00:05:14.565 --> 00:05:15.690
- Sorry. baby girl.

84
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:16.525
Good luck.

85
00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:31.498
- Hi. Angel.

86
00:05:32.333 --> 00:05:33.583
- [Baby] Mommy!

87
00:05:39.048 --> 00:05:41.467
- It's only $8 mostly though.

88
00:05:44.218 --> 00:05:46.220
I had a bad day.
- No. no. no. no.

89
00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.097
That's okay.

90
00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:50.017
(foreign language)

91
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.522
- Come here. mama.

92
00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:57.858
Come here. yes.

93
00:05:57.858 --> 00:06:00.027
(grunts)

94
00:06:00.027 --> 00:06:01.820
(old lady laughs)

95
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.072
(foreign language)

96
00:06:03.072 --> 00:06:05.865
- Oh wow. you're speaking Spanish now?

97
00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:09.203
(foreign language)

98
00:06:09.203 --> 00:06:10.453
- [Alicia] Thank you.

99
00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:11.288
- No. mommy.

100
00:06:11.288 --> 00:06:14.208
(foreign language)

101
00:06:20.713 --> 00:06:23.550
(soft. sad music)

102
00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:34.978
(girls giggling)

103
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.315
(sad music)

104
00:06:43.237 --> 00:06:44.153
- Gotta go.

105
00:06:46.365 --> 00:06:50.368
This should last you a
couple of weeks at least.

106
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.082
Hang on to that for now too.

107
00:06:55.082 --> 00:06:57.668
- This will be gone by tonight.

108
00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:01.088
Thought you were gonna get me some more.

109
00:07:01.088 --> 00:07:03.005
- [Daughter] Okay. mom.

110
00:07:18.313 --> 00:07:21.065
(door squeaking)

111
00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:24.945
(door slams)

112
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.365
(man knocking)

113
00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:36.498
- Do you have the rent for last month?

114
00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:39.208
- I will. I just need a couple more days.

115
00:07:39.208 --> 00:07:40.878
- Couple of days. what
is this couple of days?

116
00:07:40.878 --> 00:07:42.212
It's already gone.

117
00:07:42.212 --> 00:07:44.130
Tomorrow or you're out.

118
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.263
(Alicia laughs)

119
00:07:51.263 --> 00:07:54.098
- Oh where. oh where did Angel go?

120
00:07:55.683 --> 00:07:57.435
She just disappeared!

121
00:08:01.607 --> 00:08:02.440
Oh!

122
00:08:04.775 --> 00:08:05.860
- He's scary.

123
00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:11.073
- There are scarier
monsters under the blanket.

124
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.203
Now take off your shoes.

125
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.138
You have your pretzels now.
so you're okay. I guess?

126
00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:38.352
I'm gonna go take a quick shower.

127
00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:42.355
Don't answer the door for no one.

128
00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:43.148
Okay?

129
00:08:53.992 --> 00:08:56.662
(drums beating)

130
00:09:11.343 --> 00:09:13.928
(phone ringing)

131
00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:16.973
- [Paige] Leave me a
message after the tone.

132
00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:18.475
(growls)

133
00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:20.518
Bye.
(phone beeps)

134
00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:22.145
- Hi Paige. it's me.

135
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.942
I'm at the corner in Hollywood
Ridge waiting to meet you.

136
00:09:26.942 --> 00:09:29.068
I guess you're on your way.

137
00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:30.695
Just let me know.

138
00:09:30.695 --> 00:09:31.530
Okay.

139
00:09:33.365 --> 00:09:34.198
Bye.

140
00:09:36.033 --> 00:09:38.703
(drums beating)

141
00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:45.877
- [Destiny] I'm not gonna be like her.

142
00:09:45.877 --> 00:09:47.170
- Like what?

143
00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:49.255
A drunk bitter old bitch?

144
00:09:50.465 --> 00:09:52.133
- A broke old bitch.

145
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:56.305
- I will never understand

146
00:09:56.305 --> 00:09:58.932
why you continue to help that woman.

147
00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:01.768
- She's my mom. all she has is me.

148
00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:06.105
She's old and she's alone.

149
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.108
And scared.

150
00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:10.777
Getting old sucks.

151
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.698
I feel like I'm invisible.

152
00:10:16.867 --> 00:10:19.703
And then I'm losing all my power.

153
00:10:19.703 --> 00:10:22.623
- [Paige] Are you out of your mind?

154
00:10:22.623 --> 00:10:25.458
You're like the hottest.
sexiest bitch I know.

155
00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:28.628
- Sexiest. huh?
- Yeah (laughs).

156
00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:30.255
Oh my God.

157
00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:32.423
Remember when we first met?

158
00:10:32.423 --> 00:10:36.762
- [Destiny] Is that already
like nine years ago?

159
00:10:36.762 --> 00:10:38.220
- I'd never even been
in a strip club before

160
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.432
and next thing I know. I'm working in one.

161
00:10:40.432 --> 00:10:42.850
- All I remember is you
lighting your nipples on fire

162
00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:47.230
for some dude that wanted
to pay you 100 bucks.

163
00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.858
- I burnt the shit out
of my tits that night.

164
00:10:49.858 --> 00:10:50.858
(laughing)

165
00:10:50.858 --> 00:10:53.778
And we both know who
took most of that cash.

166
00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:54.613
- Not us.

167
00:10:55.738 --> 00:10:56.948
- Fuck that.

168
00:10:56.948 --> 00:10:58.115
I did all the work.

169
00:10:58.115 --> 00:10:59.660
I burnt my fucking boobs

170
00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:03.788
and that shitty strip
club took 40% of my cash.

171
00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:05.123
- [Destiny] Yup.

172
00:11:07.208 --> 00:11:10.337
- Don't ever say that
you're losing your power.

173
00:11:10.337 --> 00:11:14.715
You have more power now
than you've ever had before.

174
00:11:14.715 --> 00:11:18.720
You're smarter and sexier
than you've ever been.

175
00:11:27.603 --> 00:11:28.688
- Who's that?

176
00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.733
- We're the club now.

210
00:13:29.683 --> 00:13:31.520
So sorry I'm late.

211
00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.687
- That's okay.

212
00:13:34.855 --> 00:13:37.525
- I'm so glad you're finally here.

213
00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:38.652
- Me too.

214
00:13:38.652 --> 00:13:40.653

00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:53.875
You look so good.

219
00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.838
I'm so glad you decided
to leave that place.

220
00:13:57.838 --> 00:13:59.255
You don't deserve that shit.

221
00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:01.215
- You have no idea.

222
00:14:01.215 --> 00:14:04.760
My dad hooked up with the
world's biggest bitch.

223
00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.180
It's like I'm invisible when she's around.

224
00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.850
- He's always had some
dumb bitch on his arm.

225
00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:11.142
Time to move on!

226
00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:14.187

Do you still have the flask I gave you?

228

Cheers!

230
00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:23.280

We're gonna get a sick

Okay. party boy.

Let's go. let's get you out of here.

255

262
00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:56.498
So I hear you wanna get
into some glamor modeling?

263
00:15:56.498 --> 00:15:58.333
- Glamor modeling is just like sexy bikini

264
00:15:58.333 --> 00:15:59.750
and lingerie stuff.

265
00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.252

266
00:16:04.172 --> 00:16:05.632
(cheering)

267
00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:06.840

00:16:07.925 --> 00:16:08.760

- I'll hold this.

270
00:16:13.682 --> 00:16:16.850
- [Destiny] Perfect and then the pole.

271
00:16:20.063 --> 00:16:22.190
- [Paige] Look at you go. girl.

272
00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.860
With a little practice.
we can work with that.

273
00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:29.238
I'm gonna text a pic to my
photographer friend right away.

274
00:16:29.238 --> 00:16:31.615
He's gonna wanna shoot with you.

275
00:16:31.615 --> 00:16:35.370
- I wanna get my nose pierced like you.

276
00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:36.203
- Oh no.

277
00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:41.918
We wanna keep you as
young-looking as long as possible.

278
00:16:41.918 --> 00:16:43.628

279

280

(laughs)

283
00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:54.472
This town is filled with
sick perverted fucks.

284
00:16:57.517 --> 00:16:59.853
- I think I'm gonna be sick.

285
00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:03.440
(girls cooing)

286
00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:08.360
- Hello.

287
00:17:11.573 --> 00:17:15.993
- Well. I had no idea how
gorgeous you were gonna be.

288
00:17:19.913 --> 00:17:23.668
You actually reminded
me of my granddaughter.

289
00:17:24.835 --> 00:17:25.628
Wow.

290
00:17:27.005 --> 00:17:27.838
- 200.

291
00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:04.708
- Wait.

292
00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:12.633
Sit in this chair.

293
00:18:16.763 --> 00:18:18.430
I wanna look at you.

294
00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.358
(soft music)

295
00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.032
You smell so good.

296
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.203
(breathing heavily)

297
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:47.918
You're so pretty.

298
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:53.133

299
00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:02.267

301
00:19:25.957 --> 00:19:28.625
(Hope vomiting)

302
00:19:44.433 --> 00:19:46.268
- I am so embarrassed.

303
00:19:47.103 --> 00:19:47.937
Sorry.

304
00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:52.150
- Don't apologize.

305
00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:54.360
You have so much going on right now.

306
00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.695
I realize it can be overwhelming.

307
00:19:56.695 --> 00:20:00.240
- Who was that guy
leaving when we showed up?

308
00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.327
He gave me a creepy look.

309
00:20:04.162 --> 00:20:05.747
- You know. the acting and modeling world

310
00:20:05.747 --> 00:20:08.248
can be really competitive out here.

311
00:20:08.248 --> 00:20:09.208
Sometimes you have to figure out

312
00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:11.793
different ways to pay the rent.

313
00:20:15.048 --> 00:20:17.883
- You don't do that though. right?

314
00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:21.638
- I've had boyfriends help
me out with bills and stuff.

315
00:20:21.638 --> 00:20:23.640
It's really no big deal.

316
00:20:24.848 --> 00:20:26.683
I mean. I would have
done it for free anyway.

317
00:20:26.683 --> 00:20:28.353
so why not get paid?

318
00:20:29.728 --> 00:20:31.648
(Paige giggles)

319
00:20:31.648 --> 00:20:33.148
Oh. oh. I got you.

320
00:20:34.358 --> 00:20:37.862
(Hope continues vomiting)

321
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.200
(soft music)

322
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.772
- Good morning.

323
00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:19.320
- Angel is still sleeping.

324
00:21:21.738 --> 00:21:24.867
You know. I saw a lot
of different visitors

325
00:21:24.867 --> 00:21:28.788
coming in and out of your
apartment last night.

326
00:21:29.663 --> 00:21:32.165
You need to be careful who you let inside.

327
00:21:32.165 --> 00:21:34.918
- Yeah. I know. I'm always safe.

328
00:21:34.918 --> 00:21:38.463
I would never risk hurting my baby.

329
00:21:38.463 --> 00:21:41.675
Anyways. I'm gonna be out of here soon.

330
00:21:41.675 --> 00:21:43.303
- Oh?

331
00:21:43.303 --> 00:21:45.805
- I've got dreams for my baby.

332
00:21:48.598 --> 00:21:52.270
She is gonna be someone
strong and beautiful

333
00:22:00.235 --> 00:22:03.948
and get an education.
someone who's special.

334
00:22:03.948 --> 00:22:08.535
Someone who helps people.
maybe be a doctor or a nurse.

335
00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:13.333
Someone who matters in the world.

336
00:22:21.298 --> 00:22:23.593
I didn't have a choice.

337
00:22:23.593 --> 00:22:26.178
My baby is gonna have a choice.

338
00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.350
- Where's her daddy?

339
00:22:33.685 --> 00:22:36.355
Little girls need their daddies.

340
00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.160
(groaning)

341
00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:49.993
- My head.

342
00:22:50.912 --> 00:22:52.705
- That was amateur night. mama.

343
00:22:52.705 --> 00:22:55.540
You need to get your tolerance up.

344
00:23:07.595 --> 00:23:10.180
- No missed calls. no messages.

345
00:23:12.767 --> 00:23:16.187
I guess my dad didn't even notice I left.

346
00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:19.898
- Come with me in my hike.

347
00:23:19.898 --> 00:23:22.110
It'll help clear your mind.

348
00:23:29.742 --> 00:23:32.370
(panting)

349
00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:36.457
Gotta stay healthy and in
shape to compete in LA.

350
00:23:39.793 --> 00:23:41.628
What's wrong?

351
00:23:41.628 --> 00:23:43.880
You're on top of the world.

352
00:23:47.343 --> 00:23:50.263
- Sorry. it's just I feel so alone.

353
00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:55.893
I've been thinking about my mom a lot

354
00:23:55.893 --> 00:24:00.398
and what my life would be
like if she were still here.

355
00:24:02.442 --> 00:24:05.987
Sometimes I think about.
if I knew for sure

356
00:24:05.987 --> 00:24:09.157
I could be with her on the other side.

357
00:24:10.615 --> 00:24:11.533
I would go.

358
00:24:13.618 --> 00:24:17.080
Just so we could be together again.

359
00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.125
- I'll take care of you now.

360
00:24:19.125 --> 00:24:21.543
It's you and me against the world.

361
00:24:21.543 --> 00:24:23.628
(laughs)

362
00:24:25.088 --> 00:24:26.507
You're so pretty.

363
00:24:28.468 --> 00:24:29.927
What's wrong?

364
00:24:29.927 --> 00:24:31.845
We've done this before.

365
00:24:31.845 --> 00:24:33.680
You're bi. aren't you?

366
00:24:35.265 --> 00:24:37.935
- I don't really know what I am.

367
00:24:38.935 --> 00:24:42.190
When we were together. a long time ago.

368
00:24:44.858 --> 00:24:47.612
back when you used to babysit me.

369
00:24:49.197 --> 00:24:53.950
that was the first time I'd
ever done anything. sex-wise.

370
00:24:56.078 --> 00:24:58.788
I guess it just confused me.

371
00:24:58.788 --> 00:25:03.043
- There's always been a
special bond between us.

372
00:25:03.043 --> 00:25:04.045
Don't worry.

373
00:25:04.878 --> 00:25:06.963
No. one's gonna judge you

374
00:25:07.798 --> 00:25:10.383
(upbeat music)

375
00:26:40.515 --> 00:26:43.102
(city buzzing)

376
00:26:49.775 --> 00:26:50.610
Hey

377
00:26:52.903 --> 00:26:55.072
- You live here. right?

378
00:26:55.072 --> 00:26:59.368
My mom lives here too.
so I've seen you around.

379
00:26:59.368 --> 00:27:00.745
- Who is your mom?

380
00:27:00.745 --> 00:27:02.997
- The crazy drunk mess.

381
00:27:02.997 --> 00:27:05.207
You can't miss her.

382
00:27:05.207 --> 00:27:07.208
- You have a kid. right?

383
00:27:08.543 --> 00:27:09.378
- Yeah.

384
00:27:10.212 --> 00:27:13.298
- This place sucks.
- It's kind of a dump.

385
00:27:13.298 --> 00:27:15.968
- Not a good place to raise kid.

386
00:27:18.763 --> 00:27:20.598
Have you ever modeled?

387
00:27:23.933 --> 00:27:25.685
- [Paige] You should.

388
00:27:29.357 --> 00:27:32.068
All right. loosen up. nerd.
loosen up a little bit.

389
00:27:32.068 --> 00:27:33.068
That's good.

390
00:27:34.195 --> 00:27:35.278
Okay. pretty.

391
00:27:36.322 --> 00:27:37.155
Pretty.

392
00:27:39.075 --> 00:27:41.327
Okay. give him a sexy face.

393
00:27:45.122 --> 00:27:46.873
Okay. come on. mama. let's wow him.

394
00:27:46.873 --> 00:27:49.335
Show him your titties.

395
00:27:49.335 --> 00:27:51.337
- Just cover them with your hand.

396
00:27:51.337 --> 00:27:53.505
It's hotter that way. anyways.

397
00:27:53.505 --> 00:27:56.258
- I don't mind sexy. but--

398
00:27:56.258 --> 00:27:57.843
- You just really don't
wanna do this. do you?

399
00:27:57.843 --> 00:28:00.095
She doesn't wanna do this.

400
00:28:00.095 --> 00:28:03.015
- I didn't say that. I
just said I wasn't sure.

401
00:28:03.015 --> 00:28:04.517
- All right. look.

402
00:28:06.477 --> 00:28:10.815
Just cover your nipples and
nobody can see anything.

403
00:28:14.275 --> 00:28:16.695
- [Paige] Here. this'll help.

404
00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.075
(Hope coughing)

405
00:28:21.075 --> 00:28:22.410
- I thought it was water.

406
00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:27.163
- (laughs) It's vodka. take another sip.

407
00:28:28.708 --> 00:28:30.125
Don't worry.

408
00:28:30.125 --> 00:28:33.170
Every top model has posed topless.

409
00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:34.838
Think it'll be cool.

410
00:28:37.967 --> 00:28:40.135
- [Hope] Yeah. that helps.

411
00:28:45.473 --> 00:28:47.977
- [Paige] Good girl.

412
00:28:47.977 --> 00:28:49.353
- You say you wanna model.

413
00:28:49.353 --> 00:28:52.313
but you have a hard time
showing us your body?

414
00:28:52.313 --> 00:28:53.565
Makes no sense.

415
00:28:54.442 --> 00:28:55.443
- I'm sorry.

416
00:28:56.818 --> 00:29:00.322
I need to pee. I'll do it when I get back.

417
00:29:15.503 --> 00:29:18.090
(city buzzing)

418
00:29:24.053 --> 00:29:26.557
- [Dark-Haired Girl] Hey.
- Hi.

419
00:29:29.602 --> 00:29:31.770
- You know. you don't have to do anything

420
00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:34.523
that you're not comfortable with.

421
00:29:36.192 --> 00:29:40.738
It's just that you remind me
of someone I used to know.

422
00:29:43.532 --> 00:29:46.118
Things didn't end well for her.

423
00:29:47.953 --> 00:29:51.332
This industry isn't for everyone.

424
00:29:51.332 --> 00:29:52.208
- I'm fine.

425
00:29:53.292 --> 00:29:54.543
Thanks. though.

426
00:29:55.878 --> 00:29:58.047
- Are the pictures for their website?

427
00:29:58.047 --> 00:29:59.590
- What website?

428
00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:03.843
- They have a website for
webcaming and escorting.

429
00:30:03.843 --> 00:30:06.180
- Oh. no. I'm just modeling.

430
00:30:08.015 --> 00:30:10.183
You know. glamor modeling.

431
00:30:11.852 --> 00:30:13.687
- Do you have your phone?

432
00:30:13.687 --> 00:30:15.438
- No. it's in my bag.

433
00:30:16.607 --> 00:30:18.943
- I wrote down my number for you.

434
00:30:18.943 --> 00:30:22.780
just in case you ever
need someone to talk to.

435
00:30:23.948 --> 00:30:27.325
You know. I'm out here working too

436
00:30:27.325 --> 00:30:32.330
and sometimes it's just nice
to have someone to talk to.

437
00:30:32.623 --> 00:30:34.542

- Things are about to
change for you. mama.

449
00:31:06.407 --> 00:31:08.450
No more of that low-end shit.

450
00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:10.202
You're way too hot for that.

451
00:31:10.202 --> 00:31:11.035
- Yeah?

452
00:31:11.912 --> 00:31:15.165
- Girl. you'll be making so much money.

453
00:31:16.165 --> 00:31:18.752
- And you have got to
move out of that dump.

454
00:31:18.752 --> 00:31:20.462
Everyone in the building

455
00:31:20.462 --> 00:31:23.798
knows all about your little side hustle.

456
00:31:25.092 --> 00:31:28.803
- I gotta feed my kid. you
have no idea what that's like.

457
00:31:28.803 --> 00:31:30.180
I have no one.

458
00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:32.057
- You don't have to
explain yourself to us.

459
00:31:32.057 --> 00:31:34.643
We're just trying to help. that's all.

460
00:31:34.643 --> 00:31:37.897
If you're gonna do it. know your worth.

461
00:31:48.948 --> 00:31:49.867
- Hi. baby.

462
00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:53.453
- Look mommy. I got a mermaid.

463
00:31:53.453 --> 00:31:54.788
- She's so pretty.

464
00:31:54.788 --> 00:31:56.498
Oh my goodness. look at her hair.

465
00:31:56.498 --> 00:31:59.418
(foreign language)

466
00:32:12.932 --> 00:32:14.265
I got you today.

467
00:32:17.102 --> 00:32:20.188
Things are about to change. big time.

468
00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:31.240
- I was married once.

469
00:32:32.618 --> 00:32:34.118
We try for a baby.

470
00:32:36.913 --> 00:32:41.752
but God. he did not give me
the blessing that he gave you.

471
00:32:46.005 --> 00:32:49.593
And then the doctor
said no babies for you.

472
00:32:56.808 --> 00:32:58.393
I was heart broken.

473
00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:02.690
My husband. he left.

474
00:33:05.025 --> 00:33:08.988
He wanted to have children
too. but that was it.

475
00:33:13.617 --> 00:33:16.537
(foreign language)

476
00:33:17.495 --> 00:33:18.580
- I am sorry.

477
00:33:20.207 --> 00:33:22.960
- I can smell the alcohol on you.

478
00:33:25.337 --> 00:33:26.422
Life happens.

479
00:33:29.008 --> 00:33:30.175
It's not easy.

480
00:33:31.843 --> 00:33:32.928
I understand.

481
00:33:34.847 --> 00:33:39.268
But you do need to cherish
that little girl of yours.

482
00:33:42.938 --> 00:33:44.523
- I have no family.

483
00:33:46.275 --> 00:33:47.608
I grew up in foster care

484
00:33:47.608 --> 00:33:51.113
and I am not letting that happen to Angel.

485
00:33:52.322 --> 00:33:54.615
(foreign language)

486
00:33:54.615 --> 00:33:56.952
- Angel. she is your family.

487
00:33:59.663 --> 00:34:03.042
(foreign language)

488
00:34:03.042 --> 00:34:06.503
- I just need some time to get on my feet.

489
00:34:17.723 --> 00:34:20.017
- We can all have one.
(Alicia laughs)

490
00:34:20.017 --> 00:34:21.018
- Come here.

491
00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:28.067
(cellphone rings)

492
00:34:36.283 --> 00:34:38.952
- Mommy. your medicine fell out.

493
00:34:50.338 --> 00:34:52.007
- These are perfect.

494
00:34:52.883 --> 00:34:54.635
We're the club.

495
00:34:54.635 --> 00:34:56.637
She is so hot.

496
00:34:56.637 --> 00:34:58.305
We need some nudes.

497
00:34:58.305 --> 00:35:00.432
Blow this shit right up.

498
00:35:00.432 --> 00:35:03.102
- We officially have
two girls in our stable.

499
00:35:03.102 --> 00:35:04.520
(laughs)

500
00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:05.813
Neigh. bitch!

501
00:35:05.813 --> 00:35:07.980
(girls laughing)

502
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.733
Ooh and look at that.

503
00:35:12.693 --> 00:35:16.115
The pervs are already lining
up for our little nerd.

504
00:35:16.115 --> 00:35:17.950
And look what I got.

505
00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:19.535
- Is that hers?
- Mm-hm.

506
00:35:19.535 --> 00:35:20.868
- Get rid of it.

507
00:35:22.745 --> 00:35:23.580
- Done.

508
00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:31.630
(water running)

509
00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:39.638
So this guy's coming over.
he wants to meet you.

510
00:35:39.638 --> 00:35:43.808
He's gonna give you 500
bucks just for a massage.

511
00:35:43.808 --> 00:35:46.353
- I don't know how to give a massage.

512
00:35:46.353 --> 00:35:49.105
- You don't have to. it's $500.

513
00:35:49.105 --> 00:35:51.942
It'll help you pay for
your pictures today.

514
00:35:51.942 --> 00:35:55.528
- Oh. I didn't know I
had to pay for those.

515
00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:58.865
- It's for your portfolio to get work.

516
00:35:58.865 --> 00:36:01.785
of course you have to pay for them.

517
00:36:03.328 --> 00:36:06.248
Wear this. it looks so cute on you.

518
00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:12.753
And take this.

519
00:36:12.753 --> 00:36:16.550
It'll help relax you and you
won't even think about it.

520
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:20.053
It's just a massage. don't even freak out.

521
00:36:21.013 --> 00:36:23.015
It's not gonna hurt you.

522
00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.273
You have to pay your dues
in the modeling world.

523
00:36:31.273 --> 00:36:34.233
Everyone starts where you're starting.

524
00:36:34.233 --> 00:36:36.403
It's not gonna be forever.

525
00:36:45.537 --> 00:36:46.455
- Hi there.

526
00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:49.373
- Hi.

527
00:36:50.417 --> 00:36:51.918
- Everything okay?

528
00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:55.505
- Yeah.

529
00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.550
- Is this your first time?

530
00:36:59.885 --> 00:37:00.677
- Yeah.

531
00:37:02.012 --> 00:37:03.180
- I love that.

532
00:37:06.975 --> 00:37:08.310
How old are you?

533
00:37:10.938 --> 00:37:11.772
- 18.

534
00:37:12.813 --> 00:37:14.065
- Are you sure?

535
00:38:02.405 --> 00:38:05.908
Don't worry. everything will be all right.

536
00:38:08.035 --> 00:38:08.953
Just relax.

537
00:38:10.288 --> 00:38:12.958
(ominous music)

538
00:38:28.432 --> 00:38:31.100
(water running)

539
00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:09.097
- Mm. yum. yum. yummy.

540
00:39:09.097 --> 00:39:11.892
(Alicia laughing)

541
00:39:11.892 --> 00:39:14.518
(foreign language)

542
00:39:14.518 --> 00:39:17.980
I even know that one. I love pizza.

543
00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:20.942
(foreign language)

- I know my phone was in my bag.

652
00:46:51.975 --> 00:46:53.143
I need to call my dad.

653
00:46:53.143 --> 00:46:56.523
I'm sure he's tried to call me by now.

654
00:46:56.523 --> 00:46:57.940
- Here. use mine.

655
00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:03.278

00:47:23.215 --> 00:47:25.300
(scoffs)

660
00:47:32.558 --> 00:47:36.228
I need to tell you
something about your dad.

661
00:47:39.315 --> 00:47:44.112
You know. when I used to
spend the night at your house?

662
00:47:44.112 --> 00:47:45.363
Well. your dad.

663
00:47:52.787 --> 00:47:54.538
he was in the kitchen

664
00:47:56.415 --> 00:47:58.585
and he started touching me

665
00:48:00.128 --> 00:48:02.797
and he made me do things to him.

666
00:48:05.675 --> 00:48:07.927
It happened more than once.

667
00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:10.388
Please don't tell anybody.

668
00:48:10.388 --> 00:48:13.057
people will just think you're crazy.

669
00:48:13.057 --> 00:48:17.728
And if anybody found out. I
would seriously kill myself.

670
00:48:19.647 --> 00:48:22.065
(soft music)

671
00:48:33.328 --> 00:48:34.162
- Hey. girl.

- Why. what's going on?

677
00:48:48.008 --> 00:48:49.177
- My daughter.

678
00:48:52.013 --> 00:48:54.098
- I mean. will this help?

679
00:48:55.183 --> 00:48:56.683
- I can't believe I'm about to say this.

680
00:48:56.683 --> 00:48:59.228
but it has nothing to do with the money.

681
00:48:59.228 --> 00:49:00.855
I have to straighten myself out

682
00:49:00.855 --> 00:49:03.523
before it's too late for my kid.

683
00:49:05.025 --> 00:49:07.110

Shaking. crying.

Don't worry.

727
00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:16.485
Daddy will take care of you.

728
00:53:16.485 --> 00:53:17.653

You dig?

All right boys. let's get on her.

- Don't worry baby.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

736
00:53:56.317 --> 00:53:58.568

737
00:53:58.568 --> 00:54:01.530

01:08:19.638 --> 01:08:22.557
(slow. dark music)

910
01:10:10.748 --> 01:10:11.583
- Mommy!

911
01:10:13.585 --> 01:10:14.418
Mommy!

912
01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:17.713
Mommy!

913
01:10:19.548 --> 01:10:20.383
Mommy!

914
01:10:21.508 --> 01:10:23.928
(dark music)

915
01:10:46.033 --> 01:10:48.578
- [Receiver] 911. what's your emergency?

916
01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:50.038
- Yes.

917
01:10:50.038 --> 01:10:54.292
There is a small kid running
around in my property alone.

918
01:10:54.292 --> 01:10:56.795
(eerie music)

919
01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:22.570
(water running)

920
01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:31.538
(soft music)

921
01:12:20.795 --> 01:12:22.880
- [Cop] Come on. I'm trying to help you.

922
01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:23.798
Listen.

923
01:12:23.798 --> 01:12:27.343
Just stop it. just get in the car.

924
01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:28.428
- [Angel] No!

925
01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:32.473
- [Cop] Come on. come on.
just help me out. all right?

926
01:12:32.473 --> 01:12:33.308
Listen.

927
01:12:34.725 --> 01:12:37.812
It's for your own good. right.

928
01:12:37.812 --> 01:12:40.648
(soft. sad music)

929
01:12:56.705 --> 01:12:57.540
- Mommy!

930
01:12:59.958 --> 01:13:00.793
Mommy!

931
01:13:02.795 --> 01:13:06.048
- [Cop] Ma'am. ma'am. ma'am. calm down.

932
01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:09.343
- [Alicia] Fuck you. get off of me!

933
01:13:09.343 --> 01:13:10.178
- Mommy!

934
01:13:11.303 --> 01:13:12.638
- Ma'am.

935
01:13:12.638 --> 01:13:14.640
Ma'am. calm down.

936
01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:16.725
- Get off of me!

937
01:13:16.725 --> 01:13:20.480
- Listen. I wanna help you.
but you need to calm down.

938
01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.190
Do you understand?

939
01:13:22.190 --> 01:13:24.943
(crying loudly)

940
01:13:24.943 --> 01:13:27.528
I'm sorry. she's gonna be okay.

941
01:13:29.948 --> 01:13:31.825
Listen. I need you to call
this number in the morning.

942
01:13:31.825 --> 01:13:32.658
all right?

943
01:13:33.743 --> 01:13:34.577
Take it.

944
01:13:35.995 --> 01:13:36.830
Take it.

945
01:13:38.665 --> 01:13:41.250
They'll tell you your next steps. okay?

946
01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:43.628
She's gonna be okay. I promise.

947
01:13:43.628 --> 01:13:46.463
(soft. sad music)

948
01:13:51.885 --> 01:13:54.055
(sobbing)

949
01:14:12.698 --> 01:14:14.283
- Please don't.

950
01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:15.118
Please.

951
01:14:16.368 --> 01:14:18.788
(soft music)

952
01:14:36.513 --> 01:14:37.598
I'm so sorry.

953
01:14:38.850 --> 01:14:41.268
(soft music)

954
01:16:45.310 --> 01:16:48.228
- You need to file a police report.

955
01:16:50.063 --> 01:16:53.818
Fuck them. you need to
stand up for yourself.

956
01:16:57.738 --> 01:16:59.990
(knocking)

957
01:17:06.122 --> 01:17:07.332
- Hi.

958
01:17:07.332 --> 01:17:09.333
Are you Alicia Williams?

959
01:17:12.128 --> 01:17:15.298
I'm Karen Lloyd. your new case worker.

960
01:17:16.798 --> 01:17:17.633
- Hi.
- Hi.

961
01:17:19.593 --> 01:17:22.763
Mind if I come in. take a look around?

962
01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:43.910
(water running)

963
01:18:13.105 --> 01:18:14.065
I believe you were told

964
01:18:14.065 --> 01:18:16.067
that your daughter would need her own bed

965
01:18:16.067 --> 01:18:20.738
as part of the conditions in
which you might regain custody.

966
01:18:20.738 --> 01:18:22.698
- Yeah. I'm getting one.

967
01:18:23.615 --> 01:18:26.493
- You'll also need to
show that there's food

968
01:18:26.493 --> 01:18:28.162
in the refrigerator.

969
01:18:29.955 --> 01:18:34.668
And you really should do a
deep cleaning on that kitchen.

970
01:18:37.338 --> 01:18:38.505
Maybe it'll make you feel better

971
01:18:38.505 --> 01:18:40.925
to know that Angel is really thriving

972
01:18:40.925 --> 01:18:44.010
in the home that we've placed her in.

973
01:18:48.223 --> 01:18:51.060
In fact. it says here.
the family has a small dog

974
01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:54.730
and Angel is really
bonding with the animal.

975
01:18:59.527 --> 01:19:03.113
So. what is it that
you are doing for work?

976
01:19:14.833 --> 01:19:15.668
Work. job?

977
01:19:29.932 --> 01:19:31.683
- What the fuck is this?

978
01:19:31.683 --> 01:19:33.478
How much did you clear?

979
01:19:33.478 --> 01:19:35.103
- I don't know what kind of
drugs you were on last night.

980
01:19:35.103 --> 01:19:37.190
but you were fully aware
of what you were doing.

981
01:19:37.190 --> 01:19:38.940
- You're a liar.

982
01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:41.152
I know who you are.

983
01:19:41.152 --> 01:19:42.487
I'm going home.

984
01:19:42.487 --> 01:19:43.445
- Fine.

985
01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:45.155
Go home and get fucked
by your pedophile father

986
01:19:45.155 --> 01:19:46.032
like I did.

987
01:19:46.032 --> 01:19:49.702
- The only person who got
fucked back then was me.

988
01:19:49.702 --> 01:19:51.203
I remember you got me
drunk for the first time

989
01:19:51.203 --> 01:19:52.913
when I was nine years old.

990
01:19:52.913 --> 01:19:54.332
(laughs)

991
01:19:54.332 --> 01:19:57.083
You stuck your fingers inside me.

992
01:19:58.043 --> 01:19:59.712
You're a sick bitch.

993
01:20:03.173 --> 01:20:05.718
I remember the kids in the
neighborhood whispering

994
01:20:05.718 --> 01:20:07.720
that you were a lesbian.

995
01:20:10.932 --> 01:20:12.058
- Who cares?

996
01:20:12.058 --> 01:20:13.768
You're pathetic.

997
01:20:13.768 --> 01:20:16.145
- The entire neighborhood
could hear your drunk father

998
01:20:16.145 --> 01:20:18.480
yelling every fucking night.

999
01:20:20.398 --> 01:20:21.358
Did you forget that you told me

1000
01:20:21.358 --> 01:20:24.612
he used to get naked
in the shower with you?

1001
01:20:24.612 --> 01:20:26.113
That's not normal.

1002
01:20:26.948 --> 01:20:28.533
- Shut the fuck up.

1003
01:20:31.077 --> 01:20:33.328
- Why did you start calling me?

1004
01:20:33.328 --> 01:20:36.040
Why did you tell me I could
be an actress and a model?

1005
01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:37.875
Why did I believe you?

1006
01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:41.295
I'm calling the police.

1007
01:20:41.295 --> 01:20:43.880
- Go ahead and call the police.

1008
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:47.425
- I'm a very bad girl.

1009
01:20:49.262 --> 01:20:51.263
I have naughty thoughts.

1010
01:20:52.932 --> 01:20:54.600
I wanna be punished.

1011
01:20:55.977 --> 01:20:59.688
I fantasize about being gang raped.

1012
01:20:59.688 --> 01:21:01.607
It totally turns me on.

1013
01:21:03.525 --> 01:21:04.360
Fuck you.

1014
01:21:06.945 --> 01:21:08.780
- Go ahead and tell the police.

1015
01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:10.658
I have nothing to hide.

1016
01:21:10.658 --> 01:21:14.453
You're the slut who likes to
get fucked by a lot of guys.

1017
01:21:14.453 --> 01:21:17.455
That has nothing to do with me.

1018
01:21:17.455 --> 01:21:21.543
I gave you a job. I gave
you a place to stay.

1019
01:21:21.543 --> 01:21:23.087
No one wants you.

1020
01:21:23.087 --> 01:21:27.048
Not even your pedophile
daddy will take your calls.

1021
01:21:27.048 --> 01:21:28.258
(Hope screams)

1022
01:21:28.258 --> 01:21:30.845
(Paige laughs)

1023
01:21:32.555 --> 01:21:34.015
Leave. if you want.

1024
01:21:34.015 --> 01:21:37.310
We already got 10 grand
for your ungrateful ass.

1025
01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:41.230
By the way. now that you've
been on gang bang porn.

1026
01:21:41.230 --> 01:21:43.815
who the fuck is gonna want you?

1027
01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:52.198
(soft music)

1028
01:22:50.967 --> 01:22:53.135
- Have you heard anything
from those bitches or what?

1029
01:22:53.135 --> 01:22:54.720
- Paige messaged me a couple of times.

1030
01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.805
- [Friend] Oh. God.
- No shit.

1031
01:22:56.805 --> 01:22:58.307
- [Friend] You're not gonna
meet up with them. right?

1032
01:22:58.307 --> 01:22:59.140
- Never.

1033
01:23:02.395 --> 01:23:04.647
- What keeps you from going back home?

1034
01:23:04.647 --> 01:23:05.898
- To what?

1035
01:23:05.898 --> 01:23:07.775
My dad and his new kid?

1036
01:23:07.775 --> 01:23:08.693
No. thanks.

1037
01:23:10.152 --> 01:23:13.823
I mean. what keeps you
from going back home?

1038
01:23:14.782 --> 01:23:16.700
- This has been my life for so long.

1039
01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:20.370
I don't even know what
I'd be going home to.

1040
01:23:25.167 --> 01:23:27.545
Are you ready to go to work?
- Yeah.

1041
01:23:27.545 --> 01:23:28.920
- It's so much better to get there early.

1042
01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:31.048
During shift change. hardly any girls.

1043
01:23:31.048 --> 01:23:32.425
so much more money.

1044
01:23:32.425 --> 01:23:33.217
- Awesome.

1045
01:23:34.802 --> 01:23:36.595
- I'm really glad you called me.

1046
01:23:36.595 --> 01:23:37.930
- [Hope] Me too.

1047
01:23:42.935 --> 01:23:45.270
(low music)

1048
01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:50.943
- [Friend] Let's go show
those bitches who's boss.

1049
01:23:50.943 --> 01:23:52.903
- I'm so glad I don't
have to fuck guys anymore.

1050
01:23:52.903 --> 01:23:55.740
it was so fucking annoying.
- Oh my God. disgusting.

1051
01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:59.243
- [Hope] Horrendous!
(laughing)

1052
01:23:59.243 --> 01:24:01.662
(soft music)

1053
01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:25.935
- Do you really think I could
be an actress or a model?

1054
01:24:25.935 --> 01:24:28.188
- Girl. look in the mirror.

1055
01:24:29.190 --> 01:24:30.690
You're sexy as fuck.

1056
01:24:30.690 --> 01:24:32.943
(laughing)

1057
01:24:39.075 --> 01:24:41.410
(ululating)

1058
01:24:42.453 --> 01:24:43.370
- Come. come on. come on.

1059
01:24:43.370 --> 01:24:45.498
you try it.
- Okay.

1060
01:24:45.498 --> 01:24:46.832
- [Destiny] Yup.

1061
01:24:48.167 --> 01:24:49.502
(laughs)

1062
01:24:49.502 --> 01:24:50.585
Use the pole.

1063
01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:56.758
